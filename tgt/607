对于许多人来说，过去这个除夕可能是有生之年最没有「年味」的一个大年三十。
For many, the New Year's Eve may have been the most unannualized New Year's Eve in their lives.
「Yo！海均的朋友圈」的群（以下简称 Yo 群）里也是一样。
The same is true of the group "Yo! Mean's circle of friends" (hereinafter referred to as the Yo group).
有人抱怨、有人不平，有人行动了起来。
Some complain, some complain, some complain, some act.
Yo 群的初始成员是一批资深的互联网产品经理，他们来自字节跳动、腾讯、微信、拼多多、美团点评、快手、百度等知名公司。
The Yo group started out as a group of senior Internet product managers from byte jumps, Tencent, micromail, more shopping, commentary, fast hands, Baidu and other well-known companies.
除了产品经理，还有电商领域的连续创业者、投资人等，许多名字即使在互联网圈之外也广为人知。
In addition to product managers, but also the field of electricity business entrepreneurs, investors, and so on, many names even outside the Internet circle is well known.
基于整个群多年的信任关系，他们首先凑了一笔钱，捐了现金给武汉大学教育发展基金会。
Based on years of trust in the group, they first pooled their money and donated it to the Wuhan University Foundation for Educational Development.
第一批一共 86700 元打入了基金会的收款账户。
The first instalment, totalling $86,700, was credited to the Foundation's Receipt Account.
捐钱其实非常简单，但是防疫前线最缺乏的并不是钱，而是物资。
Donating money is actually very simple, but the most lacking epidemic prevention front is not money, but supplies.
物资不仅涉及到采购，还需要募集/管理资金、联络物流、盯好交接，乃至最后一公里的配送，也比平时的难度大上太多。
Not only is the material involved in procurement, but it is also much more difficult than usual to raise / manage funds, liaise logistics, keep an eye on handover, and even deliver the last kilometre.
春节期间工厂停工、大部分快递停运，加上道路封闭，平日里能等几天，现在耽搁半天都会在耽误生命。
During the Spring Festival, when factories shut down, most express deliveries are shut down and roads are closed, you can wait for a few days on weekdays.
他们都是在互联网工作十几年的产品经理、设计师、程序员等，正经工作是各个公司的 CEO、副总裁和业务负责人。
They are product managers, designers, programmers and the like who have been working on the Internet for more than a decade.
除夕夜 23:40，曹大鹏（前 nice 联合创始人）和黄海均（职人社创始人）等人，一起拉了一个群，起名叫「支援湖北」，目前已经 77 名互联网产品经理动了起来。
At 23: 40 on New Year's Eve, Cao Dapeng (former co-founder of vice) and Huang Hai-jin (founder of the staff association) joined forces to form a group called "Support Hubei," and 77 Internet product managers have been mobilized.
只要能捐出去就是胜利，谁捐都一样现在他们自己动手、做采购，对接医院做客服、搞物流，连财务都是由一家公司的 CTO 兼任，一群 P8、P9 以上的产品经理们都在一起打杂。
Now they do their own shopping, they do the shopping, they do the hospital service, they do the logistics, even the finances are all done by a CTO of a company, a group of P-8 and P-9 product managers working together.
这群平时给别人提需求的产品经理，快速梳理了其中的核心需求：1、很多容易被忽略的医院缺乏物资2、因为时间原因，统一调配的物资未必能立刻分发到中小型医院或是县级医院3、要帮他们在这几天内对接上应急物资，避免医护人员被感染。
1, many easy to ignore the core needs of the hospital materials: 2, because of time, the unified deployment of materials may not be immediately distributed to small and medium-sized hospitals or county hospitals to help them access emergency supplies within a few days to avoid the infection of medical staff.
群里陆续又凑了十几万现金，用来购买物资。
More than a hundred thousand dollars of cash were collected in the group to buy supplies.
剩下的人则分工合作，有人专门去淘宝、1688 等渠道找物资，因为群里有不少做出海创业/投资的，东南亚、印度的货源也有人专门去联系。
The rest of the people work together, some people Taobao, 1688 and other channels to find supplies, because there are a lot of groups to make business / investment in the sea, South-East Asia, India supplies are also dedicated to contact.
群里的罗子雄，是业内有名的设计师，之前是锤子科技的设计总监。
Luo Zixiong of the group is a well-known designer in the industry and was previously the design director of Hammer Technology.
他对口罩的型号、标准十分了解，大家拿不准的就来找他判断。
He has a good understanding of the type and standard of the mask and comes to him for judgment if anyone is unsure.
随着网络传播扩散，他们能对接上的物资多了，子雄整理了一份《物资标准文档》，供大家参考。
As the spread of the network spread, they were able to connect more material, Zixiong collated a "material standards document" for your reference.
很多次负责采购的兄弟都被供应商放了鸽子，原本答应签合同的货源，到最后一步反悔了。
Many times the brother in charge of the procurement were released by the supplier pigeon, originally promised to sign the contract source, to the last step back.
其中很多货源是被和他们有同样目的的人们抢走的。
Many of these sources were looted by people with similar objectives.
「只要能捐出去就是胜利，谁捐都一样。
"Whoever donates is victorious, and whoever donates it.
」他们说。
"said they.
有人专门联系医院、医生，整理出医院的情况，同步到云端表格里。
Someone specifically contacted the hospital, the doctor, sorted out the situation of the hospital, synchronous to the cloud end table.
许多需求看起来不大，比如 100 只护目镜、100 套防护服这样的需求，按「应急」的需求，群里有人专门负责对接，将每一个需求当成做产品时的一个项目来推进，谁对接、谁负责。
Many needs look small, like the need for 100 goggles, 100 suits of protective clothing. In an "emergency" situation, someone in the group is dedicated to docking, pushing each demand forward as a project when the product is made, who docks and who is accountable.
因为时间特别紧急，快一步可能就意味着少几个医护人员冒风险。
Because time is so urgent, a quick step could mean fewer health care workers taking risks.
△ 武汉市江夏区中医院收到了他们捐助的第一批 500 个护目镜一句话来说，这群互联网产品经理，拿出了做产品的思路，来解决统筹物资没有完全分配到位之前的时间差问题。
In a word, the group of Internet product managers have come up with a product idea to solve the problem of the time lag before the complete distribution of goods can be completed.
网上各种各样的信息满天飞，骗子和谣言都不少，有人冒充、冒领，有人以次充好，来路不明的物资难以验证。
All kinds of information flying on the Internet, cheats and rumors are many, some pretend, fake, some to fill up, unknown material difficult to verify.
这样的问题，各个民间援助组织或多或少都有遇到。
Such problems have been encountered to a greater or lesser extent by various private aid organizations.
这群产品经理的办法还是像平时推进项目一样，只对接有志愿者深度对接、摸了底的医院，对于别的志愿者组织能够验证的需求方，他们就将物资方推荐过去，尽可能保证每一笔物资的流动是有效率且可信的。
The group of product managers, like the usual push-through project, docked only hospitals with volunteers docking in depth and feeling the bottom, and, on the demand side that other volunteer organizations were able to verify, they recommended the suppliers to ensure that the flow of each item was as efficient and credible as possible.
云端表格除了具体的联系信息，也有专人汇总、更新每个项目的状态，如「沟通中」「已发货」「暂缓」，「已确认」的需求高亮显示，提醒大家推进，「完成对接」的则标成灰色，就如同一个项目已经 close.目前他们已经累计对接了 43 家医院，数量还在持续增加。
In addition to specific contact information, the cloud-side tables have been compiled and updated for each project. For example, the "on-board" "on-board" is on hold, and the "confirmed" demand is highlighted to remind everyone that "docking completed" is marked grey, just as a project has closed.
我们地方虽然小，但也不想被忽视Yo 群已经对接的医院列表上，有武汉协和医院、武汉中心医院这样的大型定点医院，更多的还是孝感市云梦县中心医院、荆门市掇刀中心医院等一开始没有出现在援助视野里的医院。
Though small in size, we do not wish to overlook the list of hospitals already docked by the Yo Group. Large designated hospitals such as Wuhan Concord Hospital and Wuhan Central Hospital are more often hospitals not initially seen in the assistance field, such as Yunmeng County Central Hospital and Jingmen Central Hospital.
许多容易被忽略的医院，一样面临着困难。
Many hospitals, which are easy to ignore, face the same difficulties.
Yo 群的志愿者之一、知群 CEO 马力收到了这样一条求助信息：「您可以捐助我们医院吗？我们是武汉市精神卫生中心，收治的是精神病患者，但是之前收治了潜伏期的患者导致了十几个患者感染，以及近 10 位医护人员感受。
"Can you donate to our hospital? We are the Wuhan Mental Health Center, which treats people with mental illness, but previously treated incubators have caused more than a dozen cases of infection and the feelings of nearly 10 health care workers.
因为我们的患者是特殊群体，很难转到定点医院，但是我们又没有防护用品，导致现在医护人员都暴露在感染的风险下。
Because our patients are a special group, it is difficult to transfer to designated hospitals, but we do not have protective equipment, which now exposes health-care workers to the risk of infection.
我们医院不是定点医院，也没有发热门诊，所以在防护措施购买和捐助上都得不到重视，但我们确实急需防护措施！」在后续的沟通中，这位医生说，现在武汉精神卫生中心有两个病房都出现了感染案例，其中一个病房从科主任、护士长、医生都中招了，有位八十多岁的返聘老专家症状很重。
Our hospital is not a designated hospital and there is no fever clinic, so we don't pay much attention to the purchase of protective measures and donations, but we really need to take precautions! "In follow-up communication, the doctor said that two wards of Wuhan Mental Health Center have been infected.
目前感染的患者是隔离的，但是门诊接到的重性的精神疾病患者必须要住院治疗，不得不收治，位了预防潜伏期感染，现在医院还需要腾出病房来隔离新入院患者。
Currently infected patients are isolated, but out-patients with severe mental illness have to be hospitalized and have to be admitted to prevent latent infections, and hospitals now need to vacate wards to isolate newly admitted patients.
没有防护服、护目镜，更没有医用帽子、N95 口罩。
No protective clothing, goggles, and no medical hat, N95 mask.
许多医生都在私下通过各种关系联系供应商。
Many doctors are contacting suppliers privately through a variety of contacts.
「如果是捐赠，我们只好意思要 5000 个 N95 口罩，如果是购买，口罩我们要更多。
"If it's a donation, we'll have to ask for 5,000 N95 masks. If we buy them, we need more masks.
」这位医生说。
"said the doctor.
经过沟通，Yo 群和其他的志愿者组织一起找到了少量资源帮他们应急。
After communication, the Yo group and other volunteer organizations together found a small amount of resources to help them with emergencies.
如果能有更多的资源，我们都希望能够更好地帮助像他们这样的医生。
With more resources, we all hope to be better able to help doctors like them.
△ Yo 群收到的来自一线医护人员求助需求来自四面八方，更多的产品经理动了起来。
The demand for first-line medical help from the?? Yo group is coming from all sides, and more product managers are moving in.
一位曾在美团工作过的产品经理，看到 Yo 群的信息之后联系到黄海均，他的亲妹妹在武汉一家医院当医生，但是没有口罩、防护服等基本设备。
A former product manager who worked for the Corps contacted Huang Hai Jing after seeing information about the Yo group. His own sister worked as a doctor in a Wuhan hospital but did not have basic equipment such as masks or protective clothing.
哥哥在北京非常焦急，这位妹妹所在医院的需求，也加入了 Yo 群的需求列表。
Brother was anxious in Beijing, and the needs of his sister's hospital added to the list of Yo's needs.
最初他们只是一群彼此熟悉的朋友凑了一些钱来做这件事，加起来有几十万的现金，在三天的时间里，这个群已经梳理完流程，从除夕的一个电话会议开始，募款捐献的群，变成一个物资对接的客服中台。
At first they were just a bunch of friends who knew each other and put together a few hundred thousand dollars in cash. In three days, the group had sorted out the process, starting with a conference call on New Year's Eve, and turned the collection of fundraisers into a customer service center for docking.
我把他们梳理的资源/物资联系方式放在「阅读原文」里，如果你有资源，但是缺乏可靠的中间环节，搞定专业环节、递送到需要的医院手中，或者有相应的求助信息（需要是医院里的工作人员，避免冒充、冒领等风险），都可以填写这个表单。
If you have the resources but do not have a reliable intermediate link, you can handle the professional process, deliver it to the hospital where you need it, or have the corresponding help message (you need to be a hospital worker to avoid the risk of impersonation, fraud, etc.), you can fill out this form.
另外，古典发布了一篇《联系 73 家医院发了 38 万货以后，总结出给捐助者的 8 条攻略》相当全面，也给想要出一份力的你参考。
In addition, Classical released a "Contact 73 hospitals issued 380,000 goods, summed up to the donors of the eight attack" quite comprehensive, but also want to give you a reference.
