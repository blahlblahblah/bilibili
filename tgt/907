2月12日，距离柯亮生下孩子已半个月。
On February 12, it was half a month since Kohlang gave birth.
她仍旧需要与初生的小女儿保持距离，没有哺乳与接触。
She still had to keep her baby girl at arm's length, with no breastfeeding or contact.
先生和公婆也无法近身照顾她太多，更多的时候，她和家人各自待在自己的房间，最近的距离是彼此的房门口。
Neither husband nor mother-in-law could take care of her too much, and most of the time, she and her family stayed in their own rooms, the nearest distance being each other's door.
柯亮的宝宝在新生儿科的隔离病区。
Kohlang's baby is in the neonatal isolation ward.
受访者供图文 |新京报记者 杜雯雯 沈彤编辑｜陈晓舒校对| 李项玲►本文约2914字，阅读全文约需6分钟这是29岁的柯亮第二次当妈妈。
Respondents for Beijing News reporter Du Wenwen Wen, editor, proofread by Li Xianling: About 2914 words, it takes about six minutes to read the full text. This is the second time Kogyang, 29, has been a mother.
一周之前，她从湖北黄石市妇幼保健院出院。
A week ago, she was discharged from Huangshi Maternal and Child Health Center.
除了“二胎妈妈”，她还带着一个特殊的身份：黄石首例被确诊感染新冠肺炎的孕产妇。
In addition to her second child, she has a special status: Yellowstone's first case of a woman diagnosed with pneumonia.
面对新冠病毒的“袭击”，柯亮也说不清，到底是年轻的身体帮了她，还是凭借母爱扛了过来。
In the face of the new crown virus "attack," KoLiang also can not say, after all is the young body to help her, or by virtue of maternal love carried over.
总之，她得到了所有人期盼的结局：治愈归家，母女平安。
In short, she got what everyone wanted: a cure for her home and a mother and daughter.
“应该不是那个病吧”2月12日，距离柯亮生下孩子已半个月。
"It's probably not that illness," Feb. 12, half a month after Kohlang gave birth to her baby.
她仍旧需要与初生的小女儿保持距离，没有哺乳与接触。
She still had to keep her baby girl at arm's length, with no breastfeeding or contact.
先生和公婆也无法近身照顾她太多，更多的时候，她和家人各自待在自己的房间，最近的距离是彼此的房门口。
Neither husband nor mother-in-law could take care of her too much, and most of the time, she and her family stayed in their own rooms, the nearest distance being each other's door.
不过至今她也无法确认，自己是在何时、何地被感染了新冠病毒。
But so far she has not been able to confirm when and where she was infected with the new crown virus.
从2019年春季得知怀了二胎后，她便定期前往黄石市中医院产检，一直以来各项指标都很正常。
Having been informed of her second child in the spring of 2019, she made regular visits to the Huangshi Chinese Hospital for check-ups, all of which had been normal.
如果顺利的话，孩子将在2月15日左右出生。
If it goes well, the baby will be born around February 15.
但新冠肺炎疫情打乱了一切。
But the outbreak of new crown pneumonia disrupted everything.
2020年1月，在疫情蔓延时，柯亮正处于行动不便的孕晚期。
In January 2020, when the epidemic spread, Kohlang was in the late stages of gestation with reduced mobility.
大多数时间，她都宅居在黄石市区的家中，少有的几次外出，是给即将出生的孩子添置生活用品。
Most of the time, she lives in her home in Yellowstone, and rarely goes out to buy supplies for her upcoming baby.
最远的距离是前往阳新县韦源口镇的娘家。
The furthest distance is to Yangxin County Weiyuan Kou town of the mother's family.
黄石距离武汉近百公里，柯亮只在新闻上关注过疫情，她没听说过亲朋中有人染病，也没有从武汉前来的朋友，这让她放松了警惕。
Huangshi nearly 100 kilometers away from Wuhan, KoLiang only in the news about the epidemic, she did not hear of friends and relatives infected with the disease, nor from Wuhan friends, which let her relax her guard.
在母婴店、超市、搭乘公交车或出租车时，她几乎没有佩戴过口罩防护。
She rarely wears a mask when she is in a mother's or a mother's shop, supermarket, bus or taxi.
2020年1月20日左右，丈夫有些发热不适，后来被证实是普通感冒，虚惊一场。
Around January 20, 2020, her husband had a fever, which turned out to be a common cold and a false alarm.
但随后的几天里，柯亮也表现出类似感冒的症状，流鼻涕、打喷嚏，头也昏昏的。
Over the next few days, however, Koehler developed symptoms similar to a cold, running nose, sneezing and dizziness in his head.
1月29日凌晨，怀孕37周4天的柯亮腹部出现疼痛感，见红了。
January 29 in the early morning, pregnancy 37 weeks and 4 days of Koiang abdominal pain, see red.
当天下午，她在丈夫的陪同下前往黄石市妇幼保健院产检，和往常的流程一样，胎心监护和腹部B超。
That afternoon, she was accompanied by her husband to Huang Shi City maternal and child health care hospital check-up, as usual, fetal heart monitoring and abdominal ultrasonography.
医生提示她：宝宝的脐血流值偏高，并安排柯亮吸氧，将数值降到正常范围。
The doctor prompted her: baby's umbilical blood flow value is high, and arrange Kohlang oxygen absorption, reduce the value to normal range.
临走时，柯亮说自己好像感冒了，医生建议她到一楼内科再去看看。
Before she left, Koguryo said she seemed to have a cold. The doctor suggested that she go to the first floor of internal medicine.
一楼的护士帮她量了体温，温度计显示37.6℃，低烧。
The nurse on the first floor took her temperature. The thermometer showed 37.6 ℃, low fever.
考虑到她的孕妇身份，发热门诊的大夫谨慎地向她告知了此时CT的风险：不排除CT或许对宝宝有影响，但如果不做，无法观察到肺部感染的情况，一旦延误恶化，结果更糟。
Given her status as a pregnant woman, the doctor at the fever clinic carefully informed her about the risks of CT at the time: CT may not be ruled out for the baby, but if it is not done, lung infections cannot be observed, and if the delay worsens, the results are worse.
在CT室外等待结果的那一小时里，柯亮心里没底，“应该不是那个病吧。
During the hour of waiting outside on CT for the result, Koehliang had no idea. "It shouldn't have been that illness.
”直到拿到CT检查报告单和血项检查结果，她才发现情况不妙：左侧肺部感染，白细胞异常，血氧浓度也偏低。
It wasn't until she got the CT scan and blood tests that she noticed something wrong: an infection in the left lung, abnormal white blood cells and low blood oxygen levels.
当天柯亮就被作为高度疑似病人收入隔离病区住院，同时被提取咽拭子样本，等待核酸试剂盒的检测结果。
On the same day Kohlang was hospitalized as a highly suspected patient in an income-segregated area, while swabbing samples were taken to await the results of a nucleic acid kit.
事后，她尝试回忆自己过去一整月的行程，只有一次她不太确定：1月23日的夜间七点多，她叫了一辆的士，带着两岁多的大儿子从娘家赶回市区，车程不到一小时。
After the event, she tried to recall her trip over the past month, only once she was unsure: more than seven in the evening of January 23, she called a taxi and drove her eldest son, more than two years old, from her family home to the city within an hour's drive.
中途，司机停了车，载上路边一位戴着口罩的男士。
Halfway through, the driver stopped and picked up a man wearing a mask on the side of the road.
光线晕暗，柯亮瞟到男士手里夹着一个公文包钻进了副驾驶座。
The light dimmed, and Koehl glanced at the man with a briefcase in his hand and got into the driver's seat.
她隐约听到司机询问对方是不是从武汉回来。
She faintly heard the driver asking if he had come back from Wuhan.
那天下着小雨，车身晃荡一路向西开，柯亮有些晕车，没听清答案，只记得抱着儿子很快便睡着。
It was drizzling and drizzling westward. KoLiang was a little seasick and didn't hear the answer, only to remember to hug his son and fall asleep quickly.
“孩子胎心有些快，大概170左右”住进医院的第一晚，柯亮持续发烧，体温最高时达到38.5度。
"The baby has a quick fetal heart, about 170 degrees." On his first night in hospital, Koehler had a persistent fever with a temperature of 38.5 degrees.
黄石市妇幼保健院产科副主任 、隔离病房负责人王芬还记得这名特殊的产妇。
Huang Shi City maternal and child health care hospital deputy director of obstetrics, isolation ward responsible for Wang Fen still remember this special maternity.
“当时孩子胎心有些快，大概170左右，”王芬说，孕妇高烧，没有宫缩的临产征兆，他们担心胎儿在宫内缺氧，决定对柯亮立即进行剖宫产手术。
"The baby had a bit of a fetal heart, about 170," Wang said. The pregnant woman had a high fever and had no signs of contractions. They worried about the lack of oxygen in the uterus.
医生们还考虑到柯亮确诊感染了新冠肺炎，病情发展会很快，如果继续妊娠，可能会失去对孕妇的最佳救治期。
The doctors also took into account Kohlang's confirmed case of pneumonia, which could quickly cause her to lose her best treatment if she continues her pregnancy.
“通过剖宫产结束妊娠，孕妇转变为产妇，减少了胎儿对母体循环、呼吸各方面的负担，也有利于疾病的恢复。
"Termination of pregnancy by cesarean section changes the pregnant woman into a woman, reducing the burden of the foetus on the maternal cycle, breathing and recovery of the disease.
” 王芬说。
'said Wang.
为保险起见，手术全程都是按照新冠肺炎确诊患者的规格来操作。
To be on the safe side, the entire procedure is performed according to the specifications of a patient diagnosed with Newly Coronary Pneumonia.
进入感染间手术室的医护都做了严密的三级防护，术后也对手术室进行标准的清洗消毒。
Medical care entering the operating room of the infection room was strictly protected at the third level, and the operating room was cleaned and disinfected on a standard basis.
头胎的顺产经验这回没能派上用场，迷糊中，柯亮只记得推进产房前签了很多字。
The first child of the natural experience did not come in handy this time, confused, Ke Liang only remember to push forward the delivery room signed a lot of words.
这位没有经历过大型手术的年轻母亲很害怕，她担心孩子能否顺利出生，更害怕宝宝出生后也被病毒感染。
The young mother, who had not undergone major surgery, was afraid that her child would be born well and that her baby would be infected after birth.
“像遭遇了一场重感冒”手术顺利，1月30日零点10分，女儿出生，体重2900克。
"Like a bad cold" surgery smooth, January 30 0: 10, the daughter was born, weighing 2900 grams.
柯亮通过了第一道难关。
Kohlang passed the first hurdle.
普通新生儿降生后的第一时刻，会被抱到母亲怀里。
The average newborn is held in its mother's arms for the first time after birth.
但柯亮的女儿出生后，立马被送往新生儿科病房隔离观察。
But immediately after KoLiang's daughter was born, she was sent to the neonatal ward for isolation and observation.
柯亮的女儿出生后，被送往新生儿科病房隔离观察。
After her daughter was born, she was sent to the neonatal ward for isolation and observation.
受访者供图生下女儿的第二天，柯亮核酸检测试剂显示双标阳性，成为湖北黄石第一例被确诊感染新冠肺炎的孕产妇。
The day after the interviewee gave birth to his daughter, the reagent showed a positive double standard, making her the first woman to be diagnosed with New Crown Pneumonia in Hubei Province.
截至2月12日下午，据黄石妇幼保健院医疗管理部门的数据，院内还有一名重症新冠肺炎产妇尚未出院。
As of the afternoon of February 12, according to the data of the medical management department of Huang Shi Maternal and Child Health Care Center, there was one pregnant woman in the hospital who has not been discharged from the hospital.
柯亮得知自己确诊新冠肺炎后，怯怯问医生，“我会不会死？”医生说，她的病情不算重，但不能排除会往严重的方向发展，目前没有特效药，除了给与相应的治疗，还需要病人保持好心态，主要还是得靠病人自身的免疫力。
When Kogyang learned of his diagnosis of pneumonia, he shyly asked the doctor, "Will I die?" The doctor said that her condition was not serious, but could not be ruled out in a serious direction, there are no specific drugs, in addition to the corresponding treatment, patients need to maintain a good attitude, mainly depends on the patient's immunity.
隔离病房在2楼，十几平方米的活动范围。
Isolation Ward on the 2nd floor, 10 square meters of activity range.
房间里有单独的洗手间，也有电视。
There is a separate bathroom and a TV in the room.
但没有近亲在身旁。
But no next of kin around.
最开始是麻药退去后的伤口痛，紧接着久躺之后的腰痛，之后便是胀奶的苦楚。
The first was the pain of the wound after the anesthetic had receded, followed by the lumbago after a long lie, followed by the pain of milk bulge.
柯亮下身插着尿管，吃喝拉撒都在床上， 护士随叫随到，但她不想次次都去麻烦别人，尝试着自己尽力去做一些事，光是从病床到卫生间的短短几步，都变得异常艰难，“像搬东西一样，一点一点挪动。
The nurse was on call, but she didn't want to bother anyone every time, trying to do something herself. Just a few steps from the hospital bed to the bathroom made it extremely difficult.
”挤出的乳汁只能倒掉，为了避免持续堵奶，她不得不求助医生，用回奶药终止了泌乳。
Extruded milk had to be poured out and she had to turn to a doctor to stop the lactation with a milkshake to avoid continued blockage.
新冠肺炎也对她身体带来影响，胸闷、喉咙剧痛，山根处有针扎感。
New Crown Pneumonia also affected her body, chest tightness, throat pain, the root of the needle feeling.
最难受的那两天，柯亮吃不下饭也起不来床，只能躺着闭眼，强迫自己平静。
The most miserable two days, Koehler can not eat or get up in bed, can only lie down to close their eyes, forced their calm.
她遵医嘱一天三顿按时服药，盐酸阿比朵尔、连花清瘟胶囊等。
She followed the doctor's advice to take medicine three times a day, Abidol hydrochloride, even Huaqing capsule and so on.
或许是因为年轻，身体抵抗力不错，柯亮渐渐好转，看起来像是遭遇了一场重感冒。
Perhaps because of his youth and good body resistance, KoLiang is getting better and looks like he has had a bad cold.
她还得到了另一个好消息，女儿出生后，两次核酸检测结果均为阴性，状态良好，已于2月5日出院。
She also got another piece of good news. After her daughter was born, both nucleic acid tests were negative and in good condition and she was discharged on February 5.
住院期间，柯亮前后共进行了四次核酸试剂盒检测，除了确诊那次，后面三次的结果分别为：阳性、阴性、阴性，达到出院标准。
In hospital, Kohlang before and after a total of four nucleic acid kit testing, in addition to the diagnosis, the last three results: positive, negative, negative, meet the discharge criteria.
回家母女分隔的这些天，柯亮只在手机上收到丈夫发来的女儿照片：裹着厚厚棉服和条纹包被，戴着粉色的帽子，高高的鼻梁很像她。
These days, when she was separated from her mother and daughter, Koehler received a picture of her daughter on her mobile phone, wrapped in thick cotton clothes and striped quilts, wearing a pink hat and a high nose girder similar to hers.
丈夫给女儿取名为“知忆”，寓意知书达理、感恩心善。
Husband gives a daughter named "knowledge", moral sense of reason, gratitude and good-nature.
她时常感到委屈，在病房里偷偷哭，与家人的每日电话或视频是她最快乐的时光。
She often feels aggrieved, secretly crying in the ward, with her family daily telephone or video is her happiest time.
57岁的母亲想不到更好的安慰办法，只会不停在电话里告知她打听到的好消息——哪里又有了新的治愈者。
A 57-year-old mother can't think of a better way to console her than to keep telling her the good news on the phone - where there is a new healer.
心里最没主意的时候，母亲甚至背着她去找所谓的风水先生给她“算命”，求得“女儿会平安痊愈”的消息才算心安。
At the worst of my mind, my mother even went to the so-called feng shui to find her "fortune-telling", to "daughter will be safe recovery" news of peace.
在元宵节的前一天，柯亮回到家中。
The day before the Lantern Festival, Kogyang came home.
医生叮嘱她，不排除再次感染的可能，回家至少隔离半个月，才算脱离危险。
The doctor told her not to rule out re-infection and to go home for at least half a month before she was out of danger.
柯亮出院时的照片。
Ko flashed out the photos of the courtyard.
受访者供图全家人都配合着不见面的默契。
The interviewees told the whole family to cooperate with the tacit understanding not to meet.
两个孩子跟着爷爷奶奶一个房间，丈夫单独一个房间，柯亮一个房间。
Two children follow grandpa and grandma a room, husband alone a room, Kohlang a room.
彼此最近的距离是在各自的房门口。
The shortest distance to each other is at the door of their respective houses.
记者对柯亮的电话采访，只能在凌晨进行——要试图说服两岁的儿子去理解“暂时不要亲密接触回家的妈妈”实在太难。
Corleone's telephone interview could only take place in the early hours of the morning in an attempt to persuade the two-year-old son to understand how difficult it is to "not get in touch with my mother for a while."
妈妈的声音只能出现在孩子熟睡后。
A mother's voice can only be heard after the child is asleep.
过去的两年时光里，她为了照顾家人，辞去工作成为全职妈妈。
For the past two years, she quit her job to become a stay-at-home mom to take care of her family.
她的朋友圈记录着儿子成长日常：宝贝洗澡真开心呀，睡着的样子好迷人啊，走路跺脚的样子调皮又可爱。
Her circle of friends chronicles the growth of her son. Baby showers are so happy, sleeping looks so charming, and stomping on foot is naughty and cute.
柯亮调侃，“大难不死，必有后福“，说自己真切体会到了老生常谈的那句，“平淡是真，生命和健康最重要”。
"Every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every hour, every hour, every hour, every hour.
一年前，她就曾在儿子的照片中敲下这句话：“宝贝你就是妈妈的动力，希望生活越来越好，事事顺心如意啊。
A year ago, she knocked on her son's picture and said, "Baby, you are the mother's motivator. I hope life is better and everything is going well.
”历经这次病痛，这位90后二胎母亲，把病愈后的人生规划定得更具体了些，“要出去工作赚钱，经济独立，给孩子更好的生活。
After the illness, the 90-year-old mother made her plans for her life more specific: "Work outside the home to earn money, become financially independent and give her children a better life.
