转眼，封城已近两个月。
It was almost two months since the city was closed.
新冠疫情肆虐，让人稠物穰的武汉变成一座“空城”。
The new Guan Rang raging, let the heavy object Rang Wuhan turned into an "empty city."
交通停运，小区封闭，身处武汉的每个人都受困于紧闭的大门内。
Traffic was suspended, the district was closed, and everyone in Wuhan was trapped inside the closed door.
好在，网课和线上办公搭建起线上网络。
Fortunately, the network and on-line office set up on the network.
在钉钉的魔性提示音中，学生和上班族得以复学复工。
In the nail's demon sound, students and office workers can resume their studies and return to work.
随着疫情情况的日渐好转，整个城市在以肉眼可见的速度重回正轨。
As the epidemic progresses, the city is back on track at a visible rate.
即便如此，生活在武汉，依然是太太太太太南了。
Even so, living in Wuhan, is still his wife's wife too South.
从基本的生活物资到进一步的精神需求，武汉人还面临着一些特殊时期的不得已和无奈。
From the basic necessities of life to further spiritual needs, Wuhan people still face some special period of necessity and helplessness.
朋友变网友，情侣变网恋，这是武汉伢们在疫情之中的社交真实困难写照。
Friends become friends, lovers become the new online love, This is Wuhan in the midst of an epidemic of real social difficulties.
已经不记得上次和朋友见面是什么时候的事情。
I can't remember the last time I saw a friend.
平日各自忙碌的大家难得有一个共同的假期，早早约好的春节聚会被迫取消。
On weekdays each busy people rarely have a common holiday, the early appointment of the Spring Festival party had to be cancelled.
等到视频连线时看到手机那头有点陌生感的脸，惊问出“你谁？”，才意识到好久不见。
When the video link to see the phone at the end of a bit strangeness face, surprised to ask "who you?", just realized that long time no see.
见面过于艰难，我们正在变成社交孤岛。
It's too hard to meet. We're becoming a social island.
同在一座城市的情侣们也体会了一把异地恋的相思疾苦，生生被“想见你”三个字折磨到茶饭不思。
Couples in the same city also experienced a long-term love of the yearning, living up to the word "want to see you" tormented the tea.
以往绞尽心思的情人节礼物缩减为两句土味情话+一个简单粗暴的红包，“多喝热水”和“好好吃饭”的安慰不再是鉴渣语录，而是疫情期间无奈的温柔。
Valentine's Day gifts have shrunk to two earthy phrases plus a simple, harsh red envelope. The consolation of "drink plenty of hot water" and "eat well" is no longer connoisseur, but tenderness during an epidemic.
不能见面的日子，维系感情的方式全靠网络一线牵。
Can not meet the day, the way to maintain the relationship depends on the network line.
隔空恋爱的情侣们云吃饭、云游戏、云看电影，以消弭空间上的间隔感，即便如此，仍要在夜深人静时，叹一口气感慨：“太难了”。
Couples who fall in love in the middle of the night sigh, "It's too hard," even as they eat, play cloud games and watch movies to eliminate the sense of space.
说真的，疫情再不结束，城市的“孤寡青年”和“社交杀手”恐怕又要成倍增加。
Indeed, without an end to the epidemic, the number of "lonely young people" and "social killers" in cities is likely to multiply.
困在家中，各种自娱自乐的方式已经通通试过一遍，所有历史遗留的影视剧、节目和书籍也都看完，剩下的只有漫长的无聊，想春游，想娱乐，想找点乐子，难。
Trapped in the home, various forms of entertainment have been tried out, all the historical legacy of the film and television drama, programs and books, there is only a long boring, want to spring tour, entertainment, to find some fun, difficult.
卯足了劲儿的“最强春节档”悄无声息地退场，封闭的电影院成了人们最先避之不及的场所。
The "strongest Spring Festival gear" quietly exits the gate, and the closed cinema is the first place to be avoided.
《囧妈》改在线上上映，不少影视剧也对湖北人民免费播放，但是大银幕的刺激与真实感难以被取代，时间过去，我们仍在等候电影院重新开放的日子。
A lot of movies and TV dramas have been shown to Hubei people for free, but the excitement and realism of the big screen cannot be replaced, and we are still waiting for the cinema to reopen.
疫情期间，VOX推出了“云蹦迪”，人人都可以做线上DJ。
During the outbreak, VOX launched "Cloud Jumps," which anyone can do online on DJ.
即便如此，我们还是更想念VOX里的人声鼎沸，想念那些live表演带来的激动与兴奋。
Even so, we missed the excitement of the VOX even more, and the excitement of the live show.
去年这时候，武大的樱花大道马上就要迎来人山人海；东湖边和植物园已经被飘扬的丝巾和小学生的嬉笑声覆盖。
At this time last year, Wuda's Sakura Boulevard was about to be filled with people; the East Lake and Botanical Gardens had been covered with flowing scarves and the laughter of schoolchildren.
今年呢？我们什么时候才能告别这份“难”，迎来真正的春暖花开？隔离之后，想要独处就变成了一种奢望，想要保留一些个人空间，太难了。
What about this year? When can we say goodbye to this "hard" and usher in a real spring bloom? After isolation, wanting to be alone becomes an extravagance, too difficult to preserve some personal space.
无论在家里的哪一个角落待着，都要做好随时被cue的准备。
Wherever you are in the house, be prepared to be true at all times.
和家人呆在一起久了，相处只有面面相觑或者争吵不断两种模式随机切换。
Stay with your family for a long time, only face each other or bicker constantly two patterns random switch.
一场疫情让不少人回到了学生时代每逢寒暑假就会经历的唠叨地狱。
An epidemic has brought many people back to the nagging hell that students used to experience every summer and winter.
“几点了，还不起床？”“玩了一天电脑了，还不休息一下？”“你怎么每天都在床上躺着，不用工作吗？”个人空间or独处时间？不存在的。
"What time is it, don't you get up?" "Playing computer all day and not taking a break?" "Why do you lie in bed every day and not have to work?"
好不容易决定专心工作？难！线上办公会议自动变成家庭会议，淡定面对同事的镜头里时不时穿着珊瑚绒睡衣晃过的人影，听着耳机里传来的孩子哭声和狗叫，还要时不时提防妈妈在身后用“帅帅”、“妞妞”之类的乳名大声喊你。
Hard to decide to concentrate on your work? Hard! Online office meetings automatically turn into family meetings, hanging around in Coral Velvet pajamas in front of co-workers, listening to children crying and barking from headphones, and constantly beware of Mom shouting at you with names like "handsome" and "booty" after you.
每当这时，就好想对天空大声喊出那句：“让我一个人静静！”2020春季最流行款服饰：睡衣。
At this time, it is good to shout out to the sky: "Let me be quiet!" 2020 spring most popular clothing: pajamas.
这个春天，想要好好打扮自己也变成一件难事。
This spring, it has become difficult to dress up properly.
因为不能出门，精致boy和精致girl们也完美融入了宅男宅女行列，仿佛要用不洗头的时长来比拼坚持隔离的决心。
Not being able to go out, the refined boy and girl are also perfectly integrated into the family mansion, as if to not shampoo the length of time to adhere to the isolation of the determination.
当我们为春节精心置办行头的时候，谁又能想到，新做的指甲、新烫的头发、新买的口红通通成了无用功。
Who would have thought that the new nails, the new hot hair, the new red mouths were all useless when we were shopping for the Spring Festival.
年前做的美甲，已经长出一半了猪猪女孩们选择在一个阳光明媚的午后，洗一个充满仪式感的头，穿上好看的上衣，再用两小时化出春日元气妆，拍几十张背景一模一样的自拍，最后用五分钟卸掉。
Half of the manicures made some years ago have grown. Piggy girls choose to wash a ceremonial head, put on a nice coat on a sunny afternoon, take two hours to make up for the spring sun, take dozens of photos of themselves with exactly the same background, and finally take five minutes off.
把照片发到朋友圈，回头看一眼满柜子的新衣服和梳妆台上才入手的化妆品，不甘心涌上心头。
Sending photos to friends, looking back at cupboards full of new clothes and dresser-only cosmetics, is not willing to take heart.
疫情结束之后想做的第一件事，就是化个美美的妆出门，自由自在地搞“个人时装秀”，和“打扮难”说拜拜。
The first thing you want to do after the epidemic is to go out in disguise, make-up, have a "personal fashion show" and "dress up hard" to say goodbye.
疫情前畅快享受网购乐趣的武汉人民，不会想到有一天，快递会成为阻隔在我们与商家之间最大的困难。
Before the epidemic enjoyed the fun of online shopping, Wuhan people will not think of the day, express delivery will become the most difficult barrier between us and businesses.
从封城到现在，你是不是大概也有8、9、10……20件快递不是被困在快递站，就是被退回，或者压根还没发货？由于武汉封城，普通物流被阻断、快递停发，武汉一时间变成无法配送的“偏远地区”，被迫回到零网购时代。
Do you think you have 8, 9, 10 couriers20 couriers are either stuck at express delivery stations, returned or not delivered at allWuhan, which has been shut down by ordinary logistics and stopped by express delivery, has suddenly become an unreachable "remote area," forced back to the era of zero-net buying.
年前买的口罩，现在还没有发货看上了电视剧里某样主角同款，和往常一样打开淘宝准备购买，却被告知“此商品不在当前地区销售”；被种草了护肤品，一问代购，得到的答复是武汉地区现在发不了快递，恢复时间未定。
The face mask bought some years ago has not been shipped to a TV show like the same protagonist opened Taobao as usual ready to buy, but was told that "this product is not sold in the current region," was grass-fed, asked the agent, the response is that Wuhan now can not express, recovery time is not determined.
当其它城市的朋友们忙着在李佳琦直播间抢东西时，武汉人只能望“快递”兴叹。
While friends in other cities are busy snatching things from Li Jia Qi's studio, Wuhan people can only hope to "express" exclamation.
小区的快递小哥已经从常用联系人列表前几位跌出，难再联系，安静离开我们生活的样子，像极了上一段无疾而终的恋情里那个想不起长相的前男友。
The neighborhood courier has fallen out of the front of the list of common contacts, hard to contact, quietly left our lives, like the last section of a fruitless relationship of the ex-boyfriends who can not remember the face.
遭遇“快递难”的我们，终于失去了生活中最后一点小确幸。
Encountered "express difficult" we, finally lost the last bit of life is indeed fortunate.
购物中心歇业，超市不对个人开放，小区封闭，买买买的逛街乐趣被完全剥离。
Shopping centers are closed, supermarkets are closed to individuals, neighborhoods are closed, and the fun of shopping is completely stripped away.
最重要的是，生活物资的购物采买目前仍是主要难题。
Most importantly, the purchase of household goods is still a major challenge.
收入跳崖式下跌，物价却坐飞机般上涨，虽然有各大团购群和app，奈何总是既拼不过手速又被各种高价劝退，我们渐渐失去“买菜自由”。
While incomes have fallen precipitously, prices have risen like planes, and although there have been big groups of buyers and apps, we have gradually lost our "freedom to buy vegetables" by being discouraged from doing so by a variety of high prices.
团购群要全天蹲守，生怕一不小心就错过了想要买的东西。
Group to squat all days, for fear of inadvertently missing out on what they want to buy.
好不容易看到自己需要的，又发现被强行搭售了其它商品。
After hard to see what they need, they found that they had been forced to sell other goods.
至于各类APP更是需要拼人品+拼手速+拼网速，欢欢喜喜选了大半天的食材加进购物车，等到付款的那一秒才发现根本抢不到，白白浪费了时间和好心情。
As for all kinds of APPs, it is necessary to compete for personal character and speed of making the Internet. They add most of the ingredients to the shopping carts and waste time and good mood.
-疫情之中，最想被满足的首先还是口腹之欲。
- Of all the epidemics, the first to be satisfied is the desire to speak.
无法出门觅食对于生活在美食之都武汉的人来说就像鱼离开水，是最难耐的折磨。
The inability to forage for food is as much a torment for those who live in Wuhan, the capital of gastronomy, as fish out of water.
困在家里的日子每个武汉人骨子里的厨师魂都被主动或被动开发，变身中华小当家，奈何不少人面临的问题仍是巧妇难为无米之炊。
Cooked at home every Wuhan people soul of the cooks are actively or passively developed into the Chinese small masters, many people face the problem is still difficult to do.
这个春天最重要的事情，回归到最原始的人类本能——民以食为天。
This spring, the most important thing, back to the most primitive human instinct - people eat as the sky.
在目前买菜难、买菜贵的武汉，如何花最少的钱买到需要的食物，成为每个人都会关心的问题。
At present, it is difficult to buy vegetables, expensive Wuhan, how to spend the least amount of money to buy the food, everyone will be concerned about.
当编辑部的同事正在为“在没有肉的情况下，如何烹饪出好吃的白萝卜”和“日均20元伙食标准能吃什么”这样的疫情限定任务而苦恼时，我们找到了一个可以用1元钱买到自选果蔬礼包的方法。
While editorial colleagues fret about the limited tasks of "cooking a delicious white turnip without meat" and "what to eat on an average 20 yuan a day," we found a way to buy a gift pack of one dollar's choice.
- 没错，花式种草小能手better君的表演时间开始了。
-Yes, it's time for you to start acting as a master gardener.
- 在特殊时期，在1元钱只能买到半个包子的武汉，1块钱能买到什么果蔬礼包？难道是临近过期或者分量超少又或者需要大老远自提？答案通通是否定，这个果蔬礼包不仅食材新鲜，种类丰富，同时还提供送货到小区门口的免费配送服务。
What kind of fruit and vegetables can you buy in Wuhan, where one yuan can only buy half a bag? Is it near the end of the term or too little or need to go all the way? The answer is no.
再来看看这些套餐礼包里都有什么：套餐A：TODAY热干面 10份套餐B：土豆、白萝卜、黄瓜、胡萝卜、大白菜等共6斤新鲜蔬菜+鸡胸肉2斤套餐C：新鲜血橙 10斤套餐D：仟吉肉松沙拉虎皮蛋糕+美式葡萄吐司+巧克力核桃蛋糕+丹麦小羊角*3+调理餐包*3每种套餐限量250份，共1000份（套餐B和套餐D因为商户、配送等原因会有略微调整，以实际为准）；考虑物流受疫情期间管制影响，市内黄陂、汉南、新洲等偏远地区如无快递送货上门，可能须自提。
B: Potatoes, turnips, cucumbers, carrots, Chinese cabbage, etc. Total 6 catties of fresh vegetables + Chicken breast 2 catties C: New Blood Orange + Chicken Breast 2 catties C: New Blood Orange + Chocolate Walnut Cake + Chocolate Walnut Cake + Chocolate Walnut Cake + Dane Lamb Corner * 3 + Dispensary Cake *
套餐四选一，无论哪一种都是绝对的物超超超超所值。
Set four options, no matter which is the absolute thing exceeding the value of the super.
1元钱在食物消费水平不断上浮的武汉显得微不足道，但现在你却可以用1元钱换取配送到家的99元自选果蔬套餐礼包，换取一刻“美食自由”。
Wuhan, with its rising food consumption level, is a small price to pay, but now you can exchange one yuan for a 99-yuan package of home-grown fruits and vegetables in exchange for a moment of "gourmet freedom."

疫情期间的困难就像是一个个将快乐和自由定时封存的小盒子，时间到了，它们就会自动解锁，重新释放出愉悦分子。
Troubles during epidemics are like small boxes where happiness and freedom are sealed at regular intervals, and when the time comes, they automatically unlock and release pleasure molecules.
我们需要做的是以好的心态去面对困难，用一些方式去度过这段特别的时光，不要放弃感受生活里的每一刻，不论是暂时的苦还是偶尔的甜。
What we need to do is to face the difficulties with a good attitude, to spend this special time in some way, do not give up feeling every moment of life, whether it is temporary or occasional sweet.
阴霾终将过去，武汉即将迎来曙光，就让我们把这些困难当成“让我们更懂得珍惜生活”的小小意外，然后共同期待，风雨后更好的武汉。
