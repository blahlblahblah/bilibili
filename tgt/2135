澎湃新闻记者 段彦超 实习生 王萨丽“刚到武汉市江夏区方舱医院时，每天轮轴转的高强度工作，我和同事感觉有些吃不消。
Peng Pai reporter Duan Yan Chao interns Wang Sally "just arrived in Wuhan Jiangxia District Fang cabin hospital, every day the wheel axis rotation of the high-intensity work, my colleagues and I feel a bit overwhelmed.
后来，情况逐渐改善，医护队伍逐渐进入正常的工作状态。
Subsequently, the situation gradually improved and the medical team gradually moved into normal working order.
”2月24日，国家（河南）中医医疗队成员、河南中医药大学第一附属医院呼吸内科护师李振鹏对澎湃新闻说，情况越来越好，大家战胜疫情的信心倍增。
On Feb. 24, Li Zhenpeng, a member of the state (Henan) medical team and nurse of respiratory department at the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Chinese Medicine, told the roaring news that things were getting better and people were more confident in overcoming the outbreak.
李振鹏在方舱医院 受访者供图李振鹏说，等疫情结束，第一件事是向家人报个平安。
When the outbreak is over, the first thing is to tell the family that it is safe, Li said.
李振鹏2月24日抗疫日记：今天是来武汉第15天，也是进入武汉市江夏区方舱医院的第11天。
Li Zhenpeng February 24 Anti-epidemic Diary: Today is the 15th day in Wuhan, and is the 11th day into the Jiangxia District Hospital in Wuhan.
从2月14日第一个夜班至今天第二次休息，我已经连续上了9个夜班。
From the first night on Feb. 14 to my second break today, I've been working nine nights in a row.
连续颠倒的夜班工作和生活，非常辛苦，但想到还有这么多患者没有康复，这些辛苦又算得了什么？我们一路走来，最主要的目的，就是要打赢这场防疫战。
We have come all the way to win the battle against epidemic diseases, working and living night shifts upside down and working very hard, but thinking that so many patients have yet to recover.
我想，在我们的共同努力下，一定会取得最后的胜利，武汉加油！我们一直都在！都说武汉的樱花十分好看，还有很多美食，我曾想过来武汉游玩。
I think, in our joint efforts, will be the final victory, Wuhan refueling! We have always been there! All said Wuhan cherry blossoms are very good-looking, there are many gourmet, I have wanted to visit Wuhan.
没想到，第一次来武汉，是紧急援助武汉抗疫，方舱内密密麻麻的床位，就是全部风景。
Unexpectedly, the first time to Wuhan, is an emergency assistance to Wuhan against the epidemic, the square cabin filled with beds, is the whole landscape.
2月10日，我们医疗队33名队员来到江夏区，经过休整、培训后，2月14日正式投入工作。
On February 10, 33 members of our medical team came to Jiangxia District, after a rest, training, February 14 formally put into operation.
当晚凌晨两点到上午八点是我第一个夜班。
I was the first night shift from 2 am to 8 am that night.
我还记得去上班时，风雨交加，我和队友坐上班车，虽然内心有一些紧张，但大家互相鼓励、支持，我们坚定信心，共同投入到抗疫战斗中去。
I remember going to work, rain and rain, I and my teammates on the bus, although a little nervous, but everyone encouraged and supported each other, we firmly believe, together into the fight against the epidemic.
目前，我们队管理的86张床位已全部收满，我作为夜班（凌晨四点到上午十点）护理组组长，一般会有3-4名医护护理这些患者，工作量还是比较大的。
At present, our team has full capacity of 86 beds, I work as a night shift (4: 00 a.m. to 10: 00 a.m.) the team leader, there will generally be 3-4 medical care these patients, the workload is relatively large.
虽然方舱医院的患者大多为轻症患者，还是有个别病情变化，比较重的。
Although the majority of patients in the square cabin hospital are mild patients, or there are individual changes in the disease, more serious.
所以，我们除完成当班工作外，要密切观察这些患者的病情变化，随时做好应对。
Therefore, in addition to completing the on-duty work, we should closely observe the changes of these patients, ready to respond.
因为连续工作，长时间戴口罩、护目镜，大家脸上都被压出深深的印迹，还有同事鼻梁皮肤都磨破了。
As a result of continuous work, wearing masks, goggles for long periods of time, everyone's face was deeply stamped, and the skin of a colleague's nose was worn out.
不过，这些“最可爱的人”从没报怨过。
But these "loveliest people" never complain.
李振鹏（左一）和三个同事我是河南中医药大学第一附属医院呼吸内科护土，从2015年参加工作至今，从来没有参与过这样的抗疫斗争。
Li Zhenpeng (first from left) and three colleagues I am the nurse of respiratory medicine at the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Chinese Medicine.
从疫情发生、主动请战、确认出征、培训考核、前往武汉、入驻方航到投入战斗，我感觉自己学到很多，也成长很多。
From the outbreak of the outbreak, unsolicited combat, confirmed military, training assessment, travel to Wuhan, into the Fangqi battle, I feel that I have learned a lot, and a lot of growth.
这些天，有辛苦，有感动，有收获，有快乐，很累，但也非常充实。
These days, there is hard work, moving, harvest, there is happiness, very tired, but also very rich.
我们每天工作是6个小时，但每次要提前1个半小时起床，准备物资、出发，因为我们要坐班车，还要穿防护服，结束后也需要1个半小时脱防护服、坐班车。
We worked six hours a day, but we had to get up an hour and a half in advance to get things ready and go, because we had to take a bus, and we had to wear protective clothing.
穿着防护服的6个小时，不能吃饭、喝水、上厕所，而且捂得特别紧，呼吸也不顺畅，浑身是汗，身上有时发痒还没法挠，这些都非常难受。
The six hours spent in protective clothing, without eating, drinking water, going to the toilet, covered with a heavy hand, not breathing smoothly, sweating, sometimes itching and not being able to scratch, are very painful.
工作中，给患者测量生命体征、发药、发饭，更会大量出汗，身上会特别不舒服。
In the work, the patient is measured vital signs, hair medicine, rice, more will sweat a lot, the body will be particularly uncomfortable.
但是，我们都克服了这些困难并适应了它。
But we have all overcome them and adapted to them.
病区里，百分之八九十都是轻症患者，除治疗外，我们还会带领患者练习八段锦、经络拍打、太极拳、跳舞，来丰富大家的生活，促进大家锻炼身体，增强抵抗力，患者们也都非常喜欢。
Eighty-nine percent of the patients in the disease area are mild cases. In addition to treatment, we will also take our patients to the eight-paragraph brocade, meridian clap, tai chi boxing and dancing to enrich our lives, promote physical exercise and build up our resistance.
这些时候，也是我们最快乐的时光。
These are the times when we are happiest.
当然，也有一些特殊情况的患者，他们的家属在此次疫情中去世了，心情十分低落。
Of course, there are also special cases of patients whose families have died from the outbreak and are very depressed.
有的患者情绪上抑郁、有的患者全家都住进了方舱医院的不同病区，心里总是提心吊胆的，等等。
Some patients are emotionally depressed, some patients live in different areas of the cabin hospital, always worried, and so on.
这些患者，我们要关注他们的心理状况，多与他们沟通，疏导他们心理，鼓励他们积极面对疫情，并最终战胜它。
These patients, we should pay attention to their psychological condition, communicate with them more, channel their psychology, encourage them to face the epidemic positively, and finally overcome it.
病区很多患者非常配合我们，也很理解我们，会主动帮我们发饭、发药，组织大家一起锻炼，时刻传递正能量，让我们很感动。
Many patients in the disease area are very cooperative with us, and also understand us, will help us to serve rice, medicine, organize people to exercise together, always convey positive energy, let us very moved.
我们常会听到病人说“感谢你们来支援武汉，你们辛苦了”之类的话，这让我非常感动，同时也感觉自己责任更重。
We often hear patients say "thank you for coming to support Wuhan, you have worked hard," which makes me very moved, but also feel more responsibility.
我时常默默告诉自己，不破疫情终不还！在武汉前，我的家人、朋友都非常担心，一再嘱咐我做好防护，但他们没有说武汉危险你不要去了，因为他们理解我。
Before Wuhan, my family and friends were very worried and repeatedly told me to take precautions, but they did not say Wuhan dangerous you do not go, because they understand me.
作为一名医护人员，这是我的责任。
As a paramedic, it's my responsibility.
当我选择这条路，就应该有这样的勇气和担当。
When I choose this path, I should have such courage and responsibility.
我一定会去，也一定会平安回来，请他们放心，此次战疫还会持续一段时间，但，胜利最终是我们的。
I will go, and I will come back safely, assure them that the epidemic will continue for some time, but ultimately the victory is ours.
既已身着白衣，便必不会负它。
If I am dressed in white, I will not deny it.
武汉的天气越来越暖和，阳光也十分明媚，我想，再过一个月，当樱花盛开时，疫情的阴霾也会随之消散吧。
The weather in Wuhan is getting warmer and the sun is shining brightly. In a month, I think, when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom, the haze of the epidemic will dissipate.
