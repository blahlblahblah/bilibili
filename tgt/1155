作为中国疾控中心原副主任，杨功焕是坦诚的。
As a former deputy director of the China CDC, Mr Yang is candid.
多年国际组织和疾控系统工作的经验让她对新冠病毒疫情中萌生的一些问题更加敏感。
Years of working with international organizations and disease control systems has made her more sensitive to some of the emerging issues of the new crown virus epidemic.
她认可武汉“封城”，对中国公共卫生硬实力有信心，但又不满新冠病毒疫情初期的反应迟缓，质疑公共卫生的软实力。
She recognized Wuhan as a "closed city," confident of China's hard public-health capabilities, but dissatisfied with the slow response to the initial outbreak of the new crown virus, questioning the soft power of public health.
她反思，专家可以发表看法，但不能替代政府的发布，而发布会更不该发布不严谨的说法。
She reflects, experts can express their views, but not a substitute for the release of the government, and the press release should not be lax.
她说，疫情防控不亚于一场战争，一个国家应该把公共卫生建设像军队建设那样重视起来。
'Prevention is no less than a war, 'she said.' A country should attach as much importance to public health as it does to military construction.
她说，目前情形下，武汉以及整个湖北的严峻形势不容乐观，那么至少这些地区无法参照新加坡放弃严防死守的做法。
In the current situation, Wuhan and the whole of Hubei Province are not optimistic, at least these areas can not follow the example of Singapore to give up strict defense, she said.
她建议疾控部门的防疫应急职能纳入行政部门，让专业人员增加话语权，以改变目前外行指挥内行的局面。
She recommends that the CDC's anti-epidemic emergency function be integrated into the administration, giving professionals a voice to change the current lay command.
在采访中，这位退休老人对提到时间点和数字的记忆甚是准确，可见她对疫情的关注程度。
In the interview, the pensioner's memory of the time points and numbers is accurate, showing how concerned she is about the outbreak.
春节期间，她退了机票放弃了回成都老家过年，以配合疫情防控，同时她也呼吁大家减少出行。
During the Spring Festival, she withdrew her ticket and gave up her old home in Chengdu for the Chinese New Year to help prevent and control the disease, while calling for fewer trips.
以下为杨功焕接受 DeepTech 专访的内容图 | 2 月 11 日，一名出院患者展示出院证明。
Following is an interview with DeepTech. A patient discharged from the hospital showed his discharge certificate on February 11.
当日，武汉市武昌方舱医院首批新冠肺炎轻症患者经过治疗出院。
On that day, Wuchang Fangkang Hospital in Wuhan City, the first patients with mild pneumonia after treatment discharged.
（来源：新华社）DeepTech：说到这次新冠病毒的教训，除了华南海鲜市场涉及到野生动物买卖教训，还有别的教训吗？杨功焕：12 月份这个病是怎么传播开来的？其实很多内情还不是很清楚。
(Source: Xinhua) Speaking of the lessons of the new canopy virus, are there any other lessons besides the South China seafood market involving wildlife trading lessons?
在传染源追踪的时候，对第一例是非常重视的，要弄清楚它究竟是怎么回事。
In tracing the source of infection, the first case is very important, to find out what it is.
媒体报道最多的是 12 月 26 日发现的那几例。
The most frequently reported cases were those reported on 26 December.
其实中国疾控中心《新英格兰医学杂志》文章指出，从 12 月 8 号起就陆陆续续有病人，而且这些病人中很多没有与海鲜市场接触。
Indeed, according to the New England Journal of Medicine, the CDC, there has been a steady flow of patients since December 8, many of whom have no contact with seafood markets.
是不是还有其他的原因，并不是很清楚。
Whether there are other reasons is not clear.
所以需要溯源。
So we need to trace it.
溯源的过程是必须非常清晰地了解这个疾病是如何传播的。
The process of traceability must be very clear about how the disease spreads.
无论是做流行病学调查的，或者是做病原学的，溯源工作都是非常重要的事，需要搞清楚。
Whether doing epidemiological investigation, or doing etiology, traceability is a very important thing to understand.
DeepTech：如果这次疫情发生在其他的比较落后、混乱的国家，可能就是更大的灾难。
DeepTech: If the epidemic happens in other countries that are lagging behind and in disarray, it could be a bigger disaster.
杨功焕：中国有非常先进的一面，因为中国的公共卫生体系，肯定是比非洲好得多。
Mr. Yang: China has a very advanced side because its public health system is definitely much better than Africa's.
第二，中国整体指挥和调度的能力也很强。
Second, China's overall command and control capacity is also very strong.
但也确实也有一些因素影响了疫情的发展。
But there are also factors that have affected the course of the epidemic.
那就是一些人员，从官员到专业人员，在疫情开始的时候没有意识到这个传染病的危害，以及发生爆发流行会带来多大的损失，反而是更多的是考虑政治上的稳定。
That is, some people, from officials to professionals, were unaware of the dangers of the epidemic at the beginning of the epidemic and how much it would cost to have an outbreak. Instead, they were more concerned with political stability.
所以就会出现训诫医生的举动。
Then there is the admonition of the doctor.
在非洲埃博拉病毒疫情中，他们的病例报告实际上都是靠文字报告，非常慢，也不准确。
In the case of the Ebola outbreak in Africa, their case reports are actually written, very slow and inaccurate.
我们的直报系统在几个小时就能把信息上达国家机构。
In a matter of hours, our direct reporting system can bring information to state agencies.
另外，现在的通讯很发达，国内很多通讯手段，例如微信群就可以很快传播。
In addition, communications are now well developed and many means of communication in the country, such as micro-groups, can be disseminated quickly.
在国际上很多国家没有中国的直报系统，世界卫生组织就是依靠追踪当地的媒体报道、学术杂志等手段来发现疫情。
Many countries do not have China's direct reporting system, the World Health Organization is relying on tracking local media reports, academic journals and other means to find the epidemic.
我们有直报系统，这是我们中国的优势。
We have a direct reporting system, which is our advantage in China.
但我们的优势没有发挥出来。
But our strengths have not been tapped.
如果尽早知道疫情，一些控制措施可以在疫情在较小规模时得到控制，然而，走到了不采取 “封城” 这样的措施就无法控制的地步。
If the outbreak had been known earlier, some control measures could have been contained on a smaller scale, but to the point where measures such as "containment" could not be controlled.
所以我觉得在中国是有好的一面，也有一些有待改进的一面。
So I think there is a good side in China and there is also some room for improvement.
DeepTech：有的院士在发布会把新冠病毒说成 SARS 病毒，还有的官员把新冠病毒传播下结论说成气溶胶传播，这些失误又得让其他专家反驳、澄清，为什么会出现这样的混乱？杨功焕：政府在开始的时候确实没有权威的声音，而专家一会说“不能人传人”，一会说“有限人传人”。
Some of the academicians presented the new crown virus as the SARS virus, and others called it aerosol transmission, and these mistakes had to be countered and clarified by other experts.
实际上专家在这种情况下应该内部关起门来探讨，而不应该让专家各说不一地去发布。
In fact, experts in this situation should be discussed behind closed doors, rather than allow experts to say different things to release.
特别在传染病这种情况下，应该是由政府来发布，要不然民众会无所适从。
Particularly in the case of infectious diseases, it should be issued by the government, otherwise the population would be at a loss.
专家有言论自由，但是不能够代替政府发布权威的声音。
Experts have freedom of expression, but they cannot substitute for the authoritative voice of government.
在传染病防控的时候，即使这个病毒还没有搞清楚、还在讨论判断过程中，但是必需的防控就必须开始了。
When it comes to infectious disease prevention and control, even though the virus is still unclear and under discussion, the necessary control must begin.
因为事实上早在 2019 年 12 月 26 日，湖北省中西医结合医院医生张继先报告的病例中，就存在人传人，特别是家庭聚集性的传染。
Because in fact, as early as December 26, 2019, Hubei Province combined with Western medicine doctor Zhang Ji-sien reported the case, there is human-to-human transmission, especially familial aggregation.
武汉市卫健委 12 月 31 号通报说没有人传人，所以我觉得这个是犯了大忌，影响到后边的防控措施了。
Wuhan city health committee reported on December 31 that there is no person-to-person, so I think this is a major bogey, affecting the control measures behind.
在传染病的面前，怎么可以这样做？这必然会引发大问题。
How can this be done in the face of infectious disease? This is bound to cause major problems.

（来源：新华社）DeepTech：现在媒体上已经有若干个声音在讲，我们这种围追堵截的策略已经给社会和经济带了不少成本，那么长期持续的话，可能会比较麻烦。
(Source: Xinhua) There are already a number of voices in the media saying that our policy of stalking is already costing society and the economy a lot, so it may be troublesome to sustain it in the long run.
有的人就觉得新加坡的做法是不是可借鉴，他们的总理李显龙也发表电视讲话说，并不会去追踪所有的感染人群去隔离，而是说把重症的患者救治作为重点。
Some people think Singapore's approach can be used as a model, and their prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, said in a televised speech that he would not track down all infected people, but rather focus on treating the seriously ill.
那么你觉得，参照我们的国情，下一阶段是不是应该去调整一下？杨功焕：我觉得现在还不是调整的时候。
So do you think the next stage should be adjusted according to our national conditions? Yang Gonghuan: I don't think it's time to adjust.
新加坡才 45 个病例，他们当然可以这么做，如果在 12 月份的武汉也可以那么做。
Singapore has only 45 cases, and they can certainly do so if Wuhan in December.
但是在 1 月 23 号的时候，就必须那么做（“封城”）。
But that must be done on January 23rd.
因为之前的放松管制以及一些大型的群体性活动，导致了这个疾病在武汉蔓延开了。
The disease spread in Wuhan as a result of previous deregulation and large-scale mass campaigns.
再不 “封城” 很可能就会引发全国性的大爆发，中国能受得了吗？所以说那个时候的武汉 “封城” 是非常正确的。
No more "closure" is likely to trigger a national explosion, China can bear it? So the "closure" of Wuhan is very correct.
到现在什么时候撤销，我觉得也是要评价的。
I feel I have to evaluate when it will be withdrawn.
现在有好几篇文章都在分省评价疫情。
Several articles are now evaluating the epidemic by province.
比如说如果上海在 2 月末，只有几个个案的时候，肯定就不会采取这么强的封锁了，可以全面复工了。
If Shanghai, for example, had only a few cases by the end of February, it would not have imposed such a strong blockade and would have been able to resume full work.
武汉又是什么情况呢？2 月 6 日中国医学科学院院长王辰在中央电视台说现在疫情的底数不甚清楚，他可能是了解情况，所以才说连底数都不清。
Wu Han, director of the Chinese Academy of Medicine, told CCTV on Feb. 6 that the exact number of cases is not clear.
最近几天还要派几千个医务人员去武汉，然后要 19 个省的对口资源，说明这个时候武汉疫情还非常严重。
In recent days will send thousands of medical personnel to Wuhan, and then 19 provinces of the corresponding resources, that this time Wuhan epidemic is very serious.
至少要考虑各个地区的情况差异。
At the very least, regional variations should be taken into account.
比如说浙江病例也上千了，但是现在的新增病例下降得非常快，如果新增病例非常少了，该地区就可能会采取另外的策略，比如小规模的隔离，以及逐步复工。
Zhejiang, for example, has thousands of cases, but the number of new cases is now falling very fast, and if the number of new cases is very low, the region may resort to alternative strategies, such as small-scale isolation and gradual return to work.
所以我觉得现在的防控措施应该说是很正确的，而且以后如何做也要根据本地的流行病学情况评估以后再往前进行。
So I think the current control measures should be said to be very correct, and how to do so in the future according to the local epidemiological situation assessment before moving forward.
但同时，武汉疫情没有控制之前，湖北疫情没控制之前，那依然是不可掉以轻心的。
But at the same time, Wuhan did not control the epidemic before Hubei epidemic control, that still can not be taken lightly.
DeepTech：你之前也提到过，SARS 之后有个阶段，中国对公共卫生比较重视，但是到目前公共卫生又比较弱了，这次是不是就显现出来了？杨功焕：其实我觉得这个未雨绸缪的思想非常重要，大家应该意识到这种疫情爆发并不是偶然的事情，也不会是唯一的一次疫情。
After the SARS outbreak, China paid more attention to public health, but at present, the public health is weaker, is it obvious this time.Yang Gonghuan: Actually I think it is very important to think ahead, we should realize that this outbreak is not accidental or the only one.
所以公共卫生就要像投资军队建设一样，除了一般的保障人民健康工作以外，在传染病的防控上，恐怕要作为整个国家的经费安排中一个非常重要的考虑。
Therefore, public health, like the investment in military construction, in addition to the general health of the people, in the prevention and control of infectious diseases, I am afraid that the whole country will be a very important consideration in the funding arrangements.
这样才不会说没有疫情的时候就把疾控体系忘掉了，而且对传染病防控可能要花更大的力量来考虑、研究。
This will not say that the disease control system will not be forgotten when there is no epidemic, and infectious disease prevention and control may take more effort to consider, study.
但因为这部分的思路可能跟一般的慢性病防控不太一样，因为传染病大规模爆发，很多时候是类似战争的。
But because this part of the thinking may not be the same as common chronic disease prevention and control, because infectious diseases erupt on a large scale, often in a war-like manner.
这一次武汉疫情真的不亚于一场战争。
This time the Wuhan epidemic is nothing less than a war.
DeepTech：美国卫生系统就有军队编制的疾控人员。
DeepTech: The U. S. health system has army-based disease controllers.
杨功焕：针对传染病和突发公共卫生事件的编制，确实需要作为国家的公共产品，由国家专门来埋单。
Yang Gung-hwan: For the compilation of infectious diseases and public health emergencies, it really needs to be a national public product, paid for by the state.
因为我觉得在决策者的层面，微生物对人类的生存、健康、安全带来的挑战，真的是不容忽视。
Because I think in the decision-making level, the microorganisms to human survival, health, security challenges, really can not be ignored.
DeepTech：没有疫情的时候，这些防控编制人员都做什么工作呢？杨功焕：演练包括研究本身是必需的。
What do these controllers do in the absence of an epidemic? Yang Gonghwan: Rehearsal including research itself is a must.
美国大概在 2001 年的时候做过一场细菌、病毒侵袭的演练，就跟部队练兵一样，我觉得这是必需的。
The United States probably did a bacteriological, viral exercise in 2001, and I think it is as necessary as military training.
但事实上防控体系里边，比较小的疫情每年都不少。
But in fact the control system inside, the relatively small epidemic every year many.
就像 2019 年 11 月的内蒙古鼠疫，那次防控还是应对得很好。
Like the Nei Mongol plague in November 2019, the control was well managed.
虽然病患到北京来了，但是整个追踪传染源、控制、治疗，总体没有造成大的损害。
Although the patient came to Beijing, but the entire tracking source of infection, control, treatment, overall did not cause major damage.
DeepTech：会不会存在这个问题，没有疫情的时候，疾控部门太闲了，有的人就闲着没事干？杨功焕：应该是有一部分应急经费，有疫情的时候才投入，平时只是投入常规经费，而且在常规项目也存在演练操作，就像部队在不打仗的时候也要训练。
If we don't have an epidemic, the CDC is too idle, and some people are free to do nothingYang Gung-hwan: There should be a contingency fund that goes in when there is an epidemic, it's usually just a regular outlay, and there are drills in regular projects, just as there are drills for troops when they're not in combat.
关键还是一个思路，我们以前可能觉得战争才是一个最关键的问题，所以要投很多，事实上人类跟微生物之间的战斗是不可少的。
The key is the idea that we might have thought that war was the most critical issue, so we had to put a lot of money into it. In fact, the battle between humans and microbes is indispensable.
DeepTech：其实思路本质是把对公共卫生重视程度提高到战争、国防安全一样的层面去讲，平时训练都是为了关键的时候能用得上，是吧？杨功焕：是这样。
The essence of the idea is to elevate the emphasis on public health to the level of war and national defense security, and the usual training is for use in critical situations, isn't it?
平时小规模疫情也是有的。
Small-scale outbreaks are common in normal times.
DeepTech：在疾控系统中，防疫传染病的经费比例在 SARS 后某个时间段是变少了吗？杨功焕：我没有很关注这部分费用的实际分配，但是我确实知道在基层经费投入是比较少的。
Is the proportion of funds spent on epidemic prevention in the disease control system decreasing after SARS? Mr. Yang: I don't pay much attention to the actual distribution of these costs, but I do know how little is spent at the grass-roots level.
国家疾控中心经费相对还是比较充足的，在上海、浙江这些东部沿海地区也还可以，但是在县一级的基层，特别是中西部是比较差的。
National CDC funds are relatively adequate, in Shanghai, Zhejiang these eastern coastal areas can also be, but at the county level, especially in the central and western parts of the relatively poor.
有些基层村医的建设也有民间的投资，比如江西抚州和北京一家公司在合作的“智慧村医工程”，这次在地方的疫情控制中发挥了很好的作用。
Some grass-roots village doctors have also made private investments, such as the "Smart Village Medical Project," a joint venture between a company in Fuzhou, Jiangxi, and Beijing, which has played a role in local epidemic control.
传染病主要发生在大城市，但是对于整体的公共体系建设，我们必须要考虑最基层、最偏远的农村。
Communicable diseases occur mainly in large cities, but for the construction of the overall public system, we must take into account the most basic, remote rural areas.
DeepTech：有专家建议说，疾控系统的话语权应该更重一些，比如说把发布疫情权力给疾控中心，你怎么看？杨功焕：美国的疾控中心是政府部门，现在中国疾控体系不是政府部门，而是事业单位，所以疫情发布必须是政府来做的话，在中国体系上它就不可能由疾控中心来替代的。
What do you think of the suggestion that the disease control system should have a stronger voice, such as giving the CDC the authority to promulgate disease? Yang Gonghuan: The CDC in the United States is a government department, now the CDC is not a government department, but an institution.
把专业技术人员的工作和政府的行政管理完全分开，卫生体系这样做其实是有些不合理的。
It is not reasonable for the health system to separate the work of professional technicians from the administration of government.
如果我们要参照其他国家，其实没有中国这样二元的做法。
If we look at other countries, there is no such duality as China.
美国疾控中心只有国家一级，在州以下它就是卫生局，所有的疾控任务都是卫生局的人在做。
CDC is only national, and below the state level it is the health department, and all disease control tasks are done by health officials.
我们应该把疾控工作详细分解以后，某些部门合并到卫生局，这样的话卫生局就不仅仅只是一个行政管理工作，就像公安局也会有很多刑侦技术人员一样。
We should break down the disease control work and merge some departments into the Health Bureau so that it is not just an administration, just as the Public Security Bureau will have a lot of forensic technicians.
中国在 1910 年代东北的鼠疫是伍连德全权负责的，他不只是个技术人员，他有行政权。
China's plague in the Northeast in 1910 was the sole responsibility of Woolende, who was more than a technician. He had executive power.
现在中国这个做法确实是很难，指挥的卫生系统官员可能不太懂，疾控系统人员又没有行政权，所以这中间涉及体制改革非常关键的问题。
China's approach is hard indeed, and the health-system officials who direct it may not understand it, and the disease-control staff do not have the executive power, so there are key issues involved in institutional reform.
（DeepTech 注：伍连德，1879-1960，是中国著名医学家、公共卫生学家，是中国检疫与防疫事业的先驱。
(Note: Wu Liande, 1879-1960, is a famous Chinese medical scientist and public health scientist, and a pioneer of quarantine and epidemic prevention in China.
他于 1910 年领导控制了东北大鼠疫。
He led the charge of the Northeast plague in 1910.
）DeepTech：按照你说的，疫情发布职能目前是没法让疾控中心去操作的。
) DeepTech: As you said, the CDC can't handle the outbreak release function right now.
杨功焕：当然了。
Mr. Yang: Of course.
中国疾控中心和美国的疾控中心不完全一样。
The CDC is not exactly the same as the CDC in the United States.
DeepTech：前几天有人指责疾控中心拿到数据发论文而没去发布疫情，如此看来，这其实并非疾控中心的失职，对吧？杨功焕：我觉得他们失职主要是，第一，有些专家出来说了一些不太负责任、不严谨的话。
It's not really a CDC dereliction of duty, is itYeung Kwok-hwan: First, I think they defaulted mainly because some experts came out and said things that were not very responsible and rigorous.
第二要问他们内部是不是跟武汉市卫生部门提了建议，当然也可能疾控中心提了建议，我们不知道而已。
Second, we should ask them if they have made any suggestions to Wuhan city health department or, of course, the CDC. We don't know.
