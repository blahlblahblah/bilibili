宣布“国家紧急状态”之后美国在防控资金、政府领导方面都已大大加强足以对付加剧的新冠疫情3月13日，美国总统特朗普在白宫宣布“国家紧急状态”，应对新冠肺炎疫情。
US President Donald Trump on March 13 declared a "state of emergency" at the White House in response to the outbreak of the New Crown Pneumonia.
图为白宫新冠肺炎疫情协调官德博拉·博克斯在发布会上介绍测试流程。
Deborah Boxer, White House Coordinator for New Crown Pneumonia, presents the testing process at a press conference.
新冠肺炎病例数字不断刷新，美国民众紧张情绪骤然升高。
Tensions rose sharply in the United States as the number of new cases of pneumonia surged.
截至3月15日，根据约翰斯·霍普金斯大学发布的最新数据，美国累计新冠肺炎确诊病例2951例，死亡57例。
As of March 15, according to the latest data released by Johns Hopkins University, the cumulative number of confirmed cases of New Crown Pneumonia in the United States was 2,951, with 57 deaths.
此前对新冠病毒一直轻描淡写的美国总统特朗普，3月13日在白宫出席记者会时，正式宣布“国家紧急状态”。
US President Trump, who previously downplayed the new crown virus, officially declared a "state of emergency" at a news conference at the White House on March 13.
待在家里、远程办公、学校关闭、剧院和图书馆关门、大型活动取消……这种改变在未来一段时间或将成为常态。
Staying at home, telecommuting, closing schools, closing theatres and libraries, and cancelling major events... may become the norm for some time to come.
为什么疫情突然变得如此紧迫，“国家紧急状态”到底意味着什么，美国的疾控体系在疫情之下如何运转？针对这些问题，《中国慈善家》杂志对美国加州大学洛杉矶分校公共卫生学院副院长、流行病学资深终身教授张作风进行了专访。
In response to questions about why the epidemic has suddenly become so urgent, what does a "state of emergency" mean, and how America's disease-control system works in the face of the epidemic, the Chinese philanthropist interviewed Zhang style, vice-president and senior professor of epidemiology at UCLA School of Public Health.
从稳定情绪到积极应对《中国慈善家》：您认为新冠疫情加剧的原因是什么？如何评估美国目前疫情风险和严重程度，未来可能会如何发展？张作风：美国疫情加剧的主要原因是美国疾控中心（CDC）在疫情早期没有把工作做好。
From stabilization to active response to The Chinese Philanthropists: What do you think is the reason for the new crown epidemic? How to assess the risk and severity of the current epidemic in the United States and how it might develop in the futureZhang style: The main reason for the increase in the epidemic in the United States is that the CDC did not do a good job in the early stages of the epidemic.
表现在两方面：第一是诊断试剂盒质量不过关，造成诊断的瓶颈，很多的可疑病人得不到诊断，这些可疑病人传播感染社区人群，造成疫情扩散。
The first is the poor quality of diagnostic kits, resulting in bottlenecks in diagnosis and the failure to diagnose many suspected patients, who spread the infection to communities.
第二是在疫情早期，CDC对应用诊断试剂盒的条件过分严格，必须要有武汉或是“钻石公主”号的暴露史。
Second, in the early stage of the epidemic, the CDC applied diagnostic kits too stringent conditions, must have Wuhan or "Princess Diamond" exposure history.
在2月下旬发生美国第一例社区感染的病例后，CDC改变了对暴露地的要求。
After the first case of community infection in the United States in late February, the CDC changed its requirements for exposure.
现在如果有症状、医生有怀疑的话，就可以做测试。
Now if you have symptoms and the doctor is suspicious, you can do the tests.
下周初，各地会开辟停车场，有症状的人可驾车在停车场测试。
Early next week, parking will be available everywhere and symptomatic people will be allowed to drive through the parking lot for tests.
其次，就是疾控中心的诊断盒数量不多，质量不够好，在州里的公共卫生实验室很难重复结果，最后还是要到美国疾控中心去核实。
Second, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not have enough diagnostic kits and is not of good quality. It is difficult to repeat the results in state public health laboratories.
这样拖延了诊断时间。
This delayed the diagnosis.
现在问题已经基本解决。
Now the problem has been basically solved.
美国食品药品监督管理局（FDA）现在已经开放商用快速、高通量的诊断试剂盒来解决这些问题。
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has now opened commercial rapid, high-throughput diagnostic kits to address these problems.
现在基本上需要检测的人都可以去检测了。
People who now basically need to be tested can do so.
很多的可疑病人都到得到及时检测。
Many suspicious patients are tested in time.
如果被诊断的话能及时隔离他们以及密切接触者，降低社区感染。
If diagnosed, it can isolate them and their close contacts in time to reduce infection in the community.
因为诊断测试的开放，最近几周病人会明显上升。
Patients have risen sharply in recent weeks as diagnostic tests have been opened.
这样就可以把可疑的病人都诊断出来，轻症居家隔离，重症住院监护治疗，对密切接触者进行隔离。
This allows suspicious patients to be diagnosed, light cases to be isolated at home, intensive hospital care, and close contacts to be isolated.
再加上学校线上学习，大型的活动取消，人们保持维持健康的卫生生活习惯，保持一定的社交距离，可能延缓疾病的上升趋势。
Coupled with school online learning, large-scale activities cancelled, people to maintain a healthy healthy lifestyle, maintain a certain social distance, may delay the upward trend of disease.
《中国慈善家》：新冠疫情在美国暴发后，联邦政府和州政府主要采取了哪些防控政策，您对此如何评价？张作风：1月21日华盛顿州 一名30多岁的男子从武汉回国后出现了症状, 成为首例确诊病例。
China Philanthropists: What are the major federal and state government policies to prevent and control the outbreak of the New Crown in the United States? Zhang style: On January 21, a 30-year-old man in Washington State returned home from Wuhan and became the first confirmed case.
美国CDC开发了自己的诊断测试,于1月24日公开发布了其测试的详细信息。
The United States CDC developed its own diagnostic tests and publicly released details of its tests on 24 January.
在华盛顿出现首例病例后约两周, 2月4日FDA批准测试。
FDA approved the test on Feb. 4, about two weeks after the first case in Washington.
CDC于2月6日至7日向州公共卫生实验室运送了90个测试套件。
CDC delivered 90 test kits to the State Public Health Laboratory from 6 to 7 February.
美国测试中有一种成分存在问题，导致超过一半的州实验室无法得出结论性的结果。
One component of the US test was faulty, causing more than half of state laboratories to fail to produce conclusive results.
1月31日，特朗普政府限制来往中国的旅行，暂停过去14天来中国旅行的任何外国公民进入美国，其中不包括美国公民的直系亲属或永久居民。
On January 31, the Trump administration restricted travel to and from China, and suspended the entry into the United States of any foreign citizen who had travelled to China for the past 14 days, not including immediate family members or permanent residents of United States citizens.
2月24日, 随着全球病例数持续攀升，特朗普政府开始为新冠病毒肺炎疫情在美国的防控做准备。
On February 24, as the number of cases around the world continued to climb, the Trump administration began to prepare for the New Crown Virus pneumonia epidemic in the United States.
白宫要求国会拨款12.5亿美元新的应急资金以加强准备工作，这是政府应对措施的重大升级。
The White House is seeking $1.25 billion in new emergency funding to strengthen preparations, a major escalation in the government's response.
2月29日西雅图附近的一名患者成为在美国死亡的第一位冠状病毒患者，3月3日联邦政府取消了对新冠病毒检测的所有限制。
A patient near Seattle became the first coronavirus to die in the United States on Feb. 29, and the federal government lifted all restrictions on testing for the new strain on March 3.
3月6日特朗普总统在白宫签署了一项83亿美元的新冠病毒肺炎紧急支出法案。
On March 6, President Trump signed into law at the White House a $8.3 billion emergency spending bill for the New Crown Virus pneumonia.
3月13日, 特朗普总统援引《斯塔福德法案》的法律，在白宫宣布因新冠病毒肺炎爆发而宣布全国紧急状态, 这将释放超过500亿美元的救灾基金.在美国暴发新冠肺炎疫情早期，特朗普总统和副总统虽然做了不少工作，但是作为政治家，他们想要稳定公民的情绪，还不想影响股市。
On March 13, President Trump, invoking the Stafford Act, declared a state of emergency at the White House over the outbreak of the New Crown Virus pneumonia, which would release more than $50 billion in relief funds.
从他们的发言当中可以看到，好像把新冠病毒看成一个大流感。
From their presentations, it seemed as if the new cap virus was a pandemic flu.
实际上，从最近一个星期来看，特朗普已经很清楚这是一个怎样的病了，所以他开始认真对待这个问题了。
Indeed, in the last week, Trump already knows exactly what kind of illness it is, so he is starting to take it seriously.
《中国慈善家》：据了解，纽约等一些城市的商场、街道、地铁等公共场所，人们外出并没有佩戴口罩，这是否会加剧病毒的传播？张作风：不单单是在纽约，基本上在全美的商场、街道、公共交通场所，人们外出都不戴口罩。
(China Philanthropists) (World Wide Web) (World Wide Web) (World Wide Web) (World Wide Web) (World Wide Web) (World Wide Web) (World Wide Web) (World Wide Web) (World Wide Web) (World Wide Web) (World Wide Web) (World Wide Web) (World Wide Web) (World Wide Web)
因为在美国的防控措施里，洗手比戴口罩更加重要。
Washing your hands is more important than wearing a mask in the United States.
这和中国是有点差别的。
This is a bit different from China.
美国人口的密度比较低，人和人之间的距离比较大，而且很多人都是自己驾车上下班，搭乘公共交通的人比较少，人和人互相通过打喷嚏或咳嗽来传播病毒的概率相对来说比较小，所以很多人都不戴口罩。
The United States has a relatively low population density, large distances between people, and many commuters drive to and from work by themselves. Public transportation is less common, and people are relatively less likely to sneeze or cough each other to transmit the virus, so many people don't wear masks.
从文化上来说，大家认为只有病人才戴口罩，正常人不带口罩，所以戴口罩的人就会比较少。
Culturally, it is believed that only patients wear masks and normal people don't, so there are fewer people wearing masks.
《中国慈善家》：针对社区传播的问题，美国卫生和相关管理部门是否做出限制人员流动等防控措施？您认为美国社区、学校、企业及家庭应该如何应对？张作风：关于社区传播的问题，美国有关部门没有一个明确的限制人员流动的防控措施，主要是建议60岁以上的老年人基本上待在家里，不要去人多的地方，不要参加聚会或者去电影院、博物馆这些地方。
What do you think American communities, schools, businesses and families should do to prevent and control the movement of peopleZhang style: With regard to community communication, the US authorities do not have a clear plan to restrict the movement of people.
如果要去超市的话，也是很短的时间买好东西就回来。
If you want to go to the supermarket, it is also a very short time to buy good things back.
目的主要是减少危险性，但不是限制行动自由，靠大家的自觉性。
The aim is primarily to reduce risk, but not to restrict freedom of movement, depending on the awareness of everyone.
不单是60岁以上的老年人，有其他身体疾病的人也同样建议待在家里，减少外出被感染的风险。
Not only people over the age of 60, but also people with other physical problems are advised to stay at home to reduce the risk of infection outside the home.
根据CDC发表的文章以及中国的经验，都发现60岁以上的人群发病率、病死率比较高，所以这些人都属于高危人群，这部分人把自己保护起来的话，整个人群就会安全很多。
According to articles published by the CDC and China's experience, people over the age of 60 have higher morbidity and mortality rates, so they are at high risk, and if they protect themselves, the whole population will be safer.
目前，美国绝大部分的学校现在基本上已经在线学习和考试，保护学生和教师。
Currently, the vast majority of schools in the United States are now largely online learning and testing, protecting students and teachers.
大部分时间他们都在家里，产生聚集性暴发的可能性就大大降低了。
Most of the time they are at home, and the likelihood of an outbreak of aggregation is greatly reduced.
对企业来说，也会尽量安排在家里工作，减少到企业被感染的情况。
For businesses, efforts will also be made to arrange for home-based work to reduce the incidence of infection in the enterprise.
家庭的预防措施基本上就是注意个人卫生，勤洗手、勤洗澡，咳嗽、打喷嚏要捂住口鼻，或者离得稍微远一点，避免到人多的地方去。
Home preventive measures are basically attention to personal hygiene, frequent hand washing, frequent bathing, cough, sneezing to cover the mouth and nose, or a little further away, to avoid places where there are many people.
家里最好采用分食制，因为病毒可以通过粪口途径污染。
It is best to divide your food at home, because viruses can be contaminated by feces.
还有就是睡好觉、吃好饭，提高了人体免疫力，危险性就会下降。
There is a good sleep, eat good food, improve human immunity, the risk will be reduced.
考验政府协同和医疗体系《中国慈善家》：请问在应对重大传染病疫情时，美国的公共卫生体系如何行使权力？联邦政府各机构之间、以及联邦政府和州政府之间怎样协调配合？张作风：上周五，当总统宣布了全国的紧急状态以后，新冠疫情的控制主要是由美国的卫生和公共服务部——相当于中国的卫健委来主要负责，协同的政府部门是联邦救灾管理局。
How does the US public health system exercise its powers in responding to major infectious disease outbreaks? Zhang style: When the President declared a state of emergency last Friday, the primary responsibility for controlling the new outbreak lay with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the equivalent of China's National Health Commission, in coordination with the Federal Disaster Relief Administration.
卫生和公共服务部主要是和疾控中心以及它的一些研究所，各个州的医院、卫生局进行协调处理。
The Department of Health and Human Services works in coordination with the CDC and its research institutes, state hospitals and health boards.
联邦救灾管理局的主要职能是向州和地方有序地发放相关的救灾基金，组建医疗救治小组，设定流动医院，提供物资运输。
The main functions of the Federal Disaster Relief Administration are the orderly disbursement of relevant disaster relief funds to states and localities, the formation of medical treatment teams, the establishment of mobile hospitals and the provision of material transportation.
他们在美国的十大区储备了粮食、药品、水和医疗器械，在必要的时候可以发放。
They have stockpiled food, medicine, water and medical equipment in the ten largest districts of the United States, which can be distributed when necessary.
在美国宣布国家紧急状态后，防控新冠病毒的经费已经上升到500亿美元左右。
Since the declaration of the state of emergency in the United States, funding for the prevention and control of the new crown virus has risen to about $50 billion.
在联邦政府层面，主要是由副总统彭斯负责的一个领导小组，成员包括卫生和公共服务部部长，美国传染病研究所所长，CDC的主任，还包括其他一些人员在行政上对整个疫情防控进行指导。
At the federal level, there is a leadership group headed primarily by Vice President Burns, which includes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Director of the American Institute of Infectious Diseases, the Director of CDC, and a number of others to provide administrative guidance on the overall epidemic prevention and control.
但具体的专业工作，由卫生和公共服务部来组织，由它协调疾控中心、医院、联邦救灾管理局，在很多方面相进行配合。
Specific professional work, however, is organized by the Ministry of Health and Human Services, which coordinates the CDC, the hospital and the Federal Disaster Relief Administration, in a number of ways.
美国是一个联邦制国家，联邦政府有时也很难控制州政府。
The United States is a federal state, and it is sometimes difficult for the federal government to control state governments.
在国家紧急状态之前，有近30个州宣布了紧急状态，它可以隔离一个地区，调动州里的国民军协助防疫。
Prior to the state of emergency, nearly 30 states declared a state of emergency, allowing for the quarantining of an area and the mobilization of the state's national army to assist in immunization.
总之，联邦政府机构比较庞大，但是州政府在防治疾病方面具有相对独立的权力，当然主要的经费还是由联邦政府提供。
In short, federal agencies are large, but state governments have relatively independent powers to combat disease, although major funding is provided by the federal government.
《中国慈善家》：据美国人口普查局的数据，2018年约有7%的美国成年人（2750万）缺乏医疗保险。
Philanthropists in China: According to the U.S. Census Bureau, about 7% of U.S. adults (27.5 million) lacked health insurance in 2018.
考虑到病毒检测和治疗的高昂费用，缺乏全民医保是否会使美国在防控疫情上变得脆弱？张作风：在新冠病毒的诊断、检验和治疗过程中，由于已经宣布了国家紧急状态，没有保险的人如果到公立医院去看病，所有的病毒检验和治疗费用全部由国家来支出。
Given the high cost of testing and treating the virus, will the lack of universal health care make the United States vulnerable to the epidemic? Zhang style: In the course of diagnosing, testing, and treating the new crown virus, the state of emergency requires that uninsured people travel to public hospitals to pay for all viral tests and treatments.
但是对那些有医疗保险的人，还是到有保险的医院去看病，检测和治疗费用由保险来承担。
However, for those with medical insurance, the cost of testing and treatment is covered by insurance, as well as at insured hospitals.
所以宣布全国紧急状态，一部分没有保险的人就可以得到足够的帮助。
So when a state of emergency is declared, some uninsured people get enough help.
《中国慈善家》：您认为美国的医疗体系和防疫体系，包括病毒检测、防疫物资和药品的生产，是否足以应对目前正在加剧的新冠疫情？张作风：目前，美国的医疗体系和防疫体系问题不是很大，因为现在医院主要是收治重症病人，他们占确诊病人的比例没有超过5%，所以医院的承受能力还是比较好的。
China Philanthropists: Do you think the medical and epidemic prevention systems in the United States, including virus testing, epidemic prevention and drug production, are adequate to deal with the new crown epidemic? Zhang style: At present, the medical and epidemic prevention system in the United States is not very problematic.
轻症病人主要是居家隔离，这样就减少了很多的住院问题，隔离期间如果出现呼吸困难的问题，要打电话到医院，及时住到医院，避免像武汉那样的医疗挤兑问题。
Minor patients are mainly isolated at home, which reduces the number of hospitalization problems. If there is respiratory distress during isolation, call the hospital and stay in the hospital in time to avoid a medical run such as the one in Wuhan.
因为CDC的拖延，所以病毒检验在前一段时间是失败的。
Virus testing failed some time ago because of the CDC's delay.
但是现在情况改变了，FDA已经全面开放，这样很多商业公司就可以参与病毒检验，奎斯特和罗氏这两家公司已经开始研究高通量的快速检测方法。
But now that things have changed and the FDA is fully open so that many commercial companies can take part in the virus tests, Quest and Roche are already working on high-throughput rapid-detection methods.
检测的问题应该不大，现在的检测能力大概是一天100万次，市场上有400万次到500万次检测的能力。
The problem of testing should be small, with about 1 million tests a day now and 4 to 5 million tests on the market.
同时开始了快速检测，如果有症状可以通过网上预约，自己开车到指定地点去采样，24到36个小时就可以拿到结果。
At the same time, rapid testing was initiated, with results available in 24 to 36 hours if symptoms were to be booked online and driven to a designated location to be sampled.
防疫物资问题也不是太大，美国救灾管理局在十个地区储备有足够的食物、药品水和医疗器械，所以如果有哪些地方进行隔离的话，物资都会有保障。
Nor is the problem of epidemic prevention too great. The United States Disaster Relief Administration has enough food, medicine, water, and medical equipment in its ten regional reserves, so if there is any quarantine, supplies will be guaranteed.
药品生产方面，特朗普总统、彭斯副总统已经和主要的制药公司开会了，在科研和生产方面尽力开发治疗新冠病毒的新药。
On drug production, President Trump and Vice President Burns have met with major pharmaceutical companies to try to develop new drugs to treat the new Crown virus, both in research and in production.
从目前情况看，我觉得美国疫情防控到了一个很好的转折点，特别是宣布了全国紧急状态以后，从资金、政府领导、组织层面来讲，这些现在都比较强，足以对付加剧的新冠疫情。
From the current situation, I feel that the United States epidemic has reached a very good turning point, especially after the declaration of the state of emergency, in terms of funding, government leadership and organization, which are now strong enough to deal with the new crown epidemic.
但是，由于开放检测，美国的病例会在未来几周内迅猛上升，这也是一个实际的情况，因为把病人查出来就可以来进行治疗和隔离。
But, because of open testing, the number of cases in the United States will rise sharply in the coming weeks, which is also a practical situation, as patients can be identified for treatment and isolation.
中国的经验教训及国际协作《中国慈善家》：在新冠疫情的防控上，您认为中国所采取的措施是否有值得美国借鉴的经验？或者有哪些应该汲取的教训？张作风：第一，中国疾控中心2月份发表的一篇英文文章，对大概4万多确诊病人进行分析，其中就发现60岁以上的老年人的发病率和病死率都相当高，相对来说，年轻人的危险性比较小一点。
China's Lessons and International Collaboration "Chinese Philanthropists": Do you think China's measures have any lessons for the United States to learn from? Zhang style: First, an English-language article published in February by the China CDC analyzed about 40,000 confirmed patients.
像这样的数据对世界各国尤其是美国，在制定疫情控制策略中起到了比较重要的作用。
Data like these have played an important role in the formulation of epidemic control strategies around the world, especially in the United States.
这是一个非常重要的保护措施。
This is a very important protection measure.
第二，武汉的方舱医院也是一个创举，其实也就是过去我们所说的野战医院，或者叫帐篷医院。
Second, Wuhan's square cabin hospital is also a pioneering initiative, in fact, we used to call the field hospital, or tent hospital.
我觉得这都是很好的经验，尤其在病人已经住不进医院的时候，让病人住在这些临时医院里面，也可能解决医疗挤兑下的一些问题，病人至少有地方可以住。
I think this is a good experience, especially when the patient has not been admitted to the hospital, to stay in these makeshift hospitals, or to solve some of the problems of a medical run, where the patient has at least a place to live.
第三，小范围的社区隔离。
Third, small-scale community isolation.
很多地方都在用，美国目前是在纽约州的威彻斯特的大概一公里的范围内进行社区隔离，基本上不让进出，但在社区里还是互动性比较大的，有商店和交通。
Many places are in use, and the United States is currently isolated from the community within about a kilometre of Westchester, New York, largely off limits, but it is more interactive in the community, with shops and transportation.
相对来说和中国的社区封闭还是有不一样的地方，人在隔离区里面是有互动的，并不是关在家里。
Relatively close to the Chinese community or a different place, people in the isolation area is interactive, not locked up at home.
举国封锁国外也有了，意大利基本上对全国出入境的旅行进行限制，而且对各个区域之间的交通进行限制，这样可能会有效防止病人从意大利的北方转移到南方，因为南方的医疗条件比较差一点，更容易产生比较高的病死率。
There has also been a national blockade, with Italy basically restricting travel across the country and between regions, which may be effective in preventing patients from moving from the north of Italy to the south, where medical conditions are poorer and higher mortality rates are more likely.
教训方面，武汉在开始封城的时候出现医院挤兑问题。
Lessons learned, Wuhan in the beginning of the closure of the city when a run on the hospital.
很多国家都在注意这个问题，所以现在基本上是采取轻症病人住家隔离、重症病人进医院的措施。
Many countries are paying attention to this problem, so it is now basically to take measures of home isolation of light patients, serious patients into hospitals.
还有，美国很重视医护人员的防控问题，疫情开始后很多医院都要求一线医生进行自我防护，对医护人员进行救治训练，减少他们被传染的可能性。
In addition, the United States attaches great importance to the prevention and control of health-care personnel, after the outbreak began many hospitals have required front-line doctors to self-protection, medical personnel training to reduce their vulnerability to infection.
《中国慈善家》：3月11日晚，世界卫生组织总干事谭德塞在日内瓦表示，新冠肺炎疫情已具有全球大流行病特征。
CHINA SOCIETY (Reuters) - World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Theresa Tupper said in Geneva on the night of March 11 that the outbreak of pneumonia had acquired the characteristics of a global pandemic.
在全球大流行的环境下，美国应该如何与国际社会合作共同应对疫情的蔓延？张作风：美国非常愿意和国际社会合作，共同面对疫情的蔓延。
In a global pandemic, how should the United States work with the international community to address the spread of the epidemic? Zhang style: The United States is very willing to cooperate with the international community to face the spread of the epidemic.
美国现在已经有1亿美金的专款用于支持有关国家新冠肺炎的防疫，美国国际开发署已经拨款3700万美金用于25个比较贫穷的国家，帮助和支持他们的医疗保护用具。
The United States now has $100 million earmarked to support the fight against pneumonia in the countries concerned, and the United States Agency for International Development has allocated $37 million to 25 poorer countries to help and support their medical protection.
同时也告诉伊朗，如果他们需要的话，美国可以提供人道援助和医疗器械的支持。
Iran was also told that the United States could provide humanitarian aid and medical equipment if they needed it.
对于中国，美国已经捐献了约17.8吨的救灾物资，这些物资都运往湖北。
For China, the United States has donated about 17.8 tons of relief supplies, all destined for Hubei.
很多个国际合作项目也在开展，因为现在情况已经变得更为严重，尤其是欧洲和伊朗这些国家和地区。
Many international cooperation projects are also under way, as the situation has become more serious, especially in countries and regions such as Europe and Iran.
美国也会支持这些国家共同抗疫。
The United States will also support these countries in their common fight against the disease.
新冠病毒不是哪一个国家的问题，而是全世界的问题，尤其在世界卫生组织宣布它是大流行病之后，新冠肺炎已经完全变成了一个世界性的问题。
The New Crown Virus is not a national problem, but a worldwide problem, especially after the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic.
