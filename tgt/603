和老高一样，我们都等待着这一天，作为一名在武汉打拼的普通市民，我爱这座城市，希望武汉好起来，希望我的故事能带给你们力量。
Like Gao, we are all waiting for this day, as an ordinary citizen in Wuhan, I love the city, hope Wuhan good, hope that my story can give you strength.
口述 | 陈　璇整理 | 竹　里我叫陈璇，今年48岁，湖北咸宁市嘉鱼县人，2013年，我和老高从奋斗了17年的中山市，回到了湖北家乡，我在武汉做烘焙工作，老高在嘉鱼县，我们还有一个23岁的儿子，目前在中山某大学攻读硕士研究生。
Chen Xuan, aged 48, from Jiayu County, Xianning City, Hubei Province. In 2013, Gao and I returned to Hubei Province from Zhongshan City, where we fought for 17 years.
一年到头，一家人团聚的次数很少，今年春节，我本打算开车和老高一起到中山过个团圆年，但事情在1月21日发生了转折。
I had planned to drive to Zhongshan for a full year with Gao this Spring Festival, but it turned out to be a turning point on January 21st.
1月20日上午，关于新型冠状肺炎的新闻开始陆续在手机上出现，当时武汉街上的市民似乎并没有当回事，没有几个戴口罩的，但我心里有点忐忑。
On the morning of January 20, news began to appear on mobile phones about new coronary pneumonia, Wuhan street people do not seem to take seriously, few wearing masks, but my heart a little perturbed.
在老高从嘉鱼来武汉之前，我再三嘱咐他：一定要戴口罩，一定要戴口罩。
Before Lao Gao came to Wuhan from Jiayu, I told him repeatedly: must wear a mask, must wear a mask.
但和我预想的一样，倔强的老高一点都不在乎，就这样“光秃秃”地回家了。
But as I expected, the stubborn old tall did not care a bit, so "bare" to go home.
21日早上我们出发前往中山，当时武汉还没有封城，一路上，同事和朋友纷纷发信息给我说，他们都选择居家隔离观察，并叮嘱我们一定要戴好口罩，到了中山不要乱跑。
On the morning of the 21st, we set out for Zhongshan. Before Wuhan was closed down, my colleagues and friends sent me a message saying that they had all chosen to stay in their homes for observation and told us to wear masks and not to run around Zhongshan.
此时我们防范意识已经很强，一路上都戴着口罩，未曾取下，但这时候，老高开始有点低烧，体温大概在37.2摄氏度左右，我开始有些慌：万一感染了咋办？武汉超市卖场戴口罩的售货员老高安慰我说，没事，也许是普通感冒。
At this point we are very strong sense of prevention, wearing a mask, but by this time, Gao began to have a little low fever, temperature about 37.2 degrees Celsius, I began to panic: in case of infection? Wuhan supermarket sales shop sales clerk Lao Gao reassured me, nothing, maybe common cold.
虽然嘴上这么说，但在见儿子之前，我俩都不约而同地多戴了层N95的口罩。
Despite that, both of us wore an extra N95 mask just before we met our son.
儿子知道这个情况后，第一时间送我们去了医院，并主动告知医生说，我们是来自湖北，看是否需要采取措施。
When our son learned about this, he sent us to the hospital the first time, and volunteered to tell the doctor that we were from Hubei province to see if something needed to be done.
结果是幸运的，去了普通门诊和发热门诊测量体温都是36.7，医生建议居家观察。
Fortunately, the body temperature was 36.7 at both the general out-patient and the fever clinic, and the doctor advised home observation.
一直到大年三十老高都未曾再发烧，但因为老高之前有过发热，为了安全起见，我们一家三口仍然不敢松懈，平时除了吃饭喝水都戴着口罩，餐具全部分开，吃饭用公筷，家里所有手接触点全部擦拭消毒。
Up to New Year's Eve no longer have a fever, but because of the fever before Lao Gao, for the sake of safety, our family still dare not relax, except for eating and drinking water are wearing masks, all the tableware separated, eating with chopsticks, the family all hands contact point wipe disinfection.
大年三十那天，我看到小区物业发朋友圈要求业主上报武汉人员信息，我们主动上报并登记了人员信息。
On the thirtieth day of New Year, I saw the neighborhood property hair friends asked the owner to report Wuhan personnel information, we voluntarily reported and registered personnel information.
当天下午，市疾控中心的人来了，量了体温，配发了口罩，叮嘱居家隔离。
That afternoon, CDC came, took the temperature, put on a mask, and told the family to quarantine.
1月28日，老高再次发烧，还伴随着拉肚子、呕吐，我们赶紧去中医医院检查，并说明了近几天的情况。
On January 28, Gao had a fever again, accompanied by diarrhea and vomiting. We rushed to the TCM hospital for a check-up and described the situation in recent days.
医生拍了CT说肺部有些问题，疑似但并未确诊，建议隔离，后转入中山市第二医院隔离治疗。
The doctor took a CT to say that there was something wrong with the lung, suspected but not confirmed, recommended isolation, and then transferred to Zhongshan City Hospital No. 2 isolation treatment.
老高被隔离了，我有些慌，但在儿子面前还是要表现镇定，回到家后，我把老高接触过的所有东西全部消毒了一遍。
Lao Gao was quarantined, I was a little nervous, but I had to keep calm in front of my son. When I got home, I disinfected everything Gao had touched.
老高被隔离的医院中山市第二医院　图 |南方+睡前，儿子特意嘱咐，要求我们的房门都开着，有不舒服就互相照顾。
Before I went to bed at Zhongshan City Hospital No. 2, my son specifically asked us to keep our doors open and take care of each other if we were unwell.
第二天醒来，医院传来了两个好消息。
The next day, the hospital woke up with two pieces of good news.
一个是我和儿子的结果都没问题，但医生说需要请示专家，看如何防护。
One was that neither my son nor I had a problem, but the doctor said he needed to consult an expert to see how to protect himself.
另一个是，在医生的悉心照顾下，老高的烧已经退了。
The other is, in the doctor's careful care, Lao Gao's fever has been retired.
在居家的这几天，我们基本不外出，吃饭在家解决，买菜、倒垃圾等需求请求物业帮忙。
In the home these days, we basically do not go out, eat at home to solve, buy vegetables, garbage and other needs to ask for property help.
1月30日，市疾控中心打来电话说，疑似病例的亲密接触者需进行隔离，所有的费用全部由政府负担，让我们准备下。
On January 30, the CDC called to say that suspected cases of intimate contact need to be isolated, all the costs are borne by the government, let us prepare under.
这下，我心里有底了，悬着的心终于可以稍稍放松下，和儿子收拾好行李，一起上了救护车。
Now, I have the bottom of my heart, the suspended heart can finally relax a little bit, with his son pack up the luggage, together with the ambulance.
没想到，第一次坐救护车，是这样的情景。
Unexpectedly, the first time I took an ambulance, it was such a scene.
到了定点酒店，工作人员穿戴防护服、戴着护目镜，然而态度非常好。
At the designated hotel, the staff wore protective clothing and goggles, but in a very good manner.
第一次被别人用另类的眼光对待，虽然不太适应，但特别能理解。
The first time was treated with a different kind of eyes, although not well adapted, but particularly understandable.
这个酒店规模很大，环境不错，我和儿子分别被隔离在一个单人间和一个双人间，酒店工作人员每日定点送三餐，垃圾定点收取。
The hotel was large and environmentally friendly. My son and I were separated into a single room and a double room.
早餐有瘦肉粥、包子、稀饭、油条，午餐、晚餐还有中山当地的肠粉，甚至十几块钱一斤的荷兰豆、炒腊肉也有。
Breakfast has lean porridge, steamed buns, porridge, fried bacon, lunch, dinner and Zhongshan local intestinal powder, even a dozen pieces of Dutch beans, fried bacon.

一个漂泊在他乡的湖北人，在这个特殊时期，能得到政府温暖的关怀，非常感动。
One drifting in another township of Hubei people, in this special period, can get the warm care of the government, very moved.
而远在千里之外，我的同事们，也正在为武汉一线的医护人员尽一份力。
Far away, my colleagues are doing their part for the medical staff in Wuhan.
自从各区150家烘焙店停业后，他们每天轮流自发地做尽可能多的面包送往武汉各大医院。
Since the closure of 150 bakeries in each district, they have taken turns making as much bread as possible each day on their own initiative to transport it to major hospitals in Wuhan.
目前，已经和武汉市九医院、武汉市八医院、汉口医院等16家医院沟通好配送事宜，其他援助医院也在持续对接中。
So far, 16 hospitals, including Wuhan Jiu Hospital, Wuhan Eight Hospital and Hankou Hospital, have been well connected to the distribution.
