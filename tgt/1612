澎湃新闻记者 王昱不久前，澎湃新闻私家地理栏目曾采访了武汉小动物协会会长杜帆，此前报道→《疫情之下，他们救助那些滞留在家的武汉小动物们》，了解到由于大量返乡过节人员短期内无法返回武汉，家中滞留猫狗存在着断水断粮的威胁。
Wu Yu, head of Wuhan Small Animals Association, was interviewed by the newspaper's private geography column not long ago. He said, "Under the epidemic, they are helping Wuhan animals who stay at home."
为了解决这个问题，武汉小动物保护协会会长杜帆率领志愿者们从1月26日开始为武汉滞留小动物提供无偿援助。
To solve the problem, Du Fan, the head of the Wuhan Society for the Protection of Small Animals, led volunteers to provide free aid to small animals stranded in Wuhan from January 26.
截止到目前，协会已经上门帮扶了1400多次，救助了5000多只动物。
So far, the association has helped more than 1,400 people and rescued more than 5,000 animals.
然而，2月17日，武汉小动物保护协会在官方公众号发布消息称，随着武汉市小区管控越来越严格，志愿者们已经无法出行，也无法进入求助者所在的小区，上门帮扶工作将不得不暂停。
However, the Wuhan Association for the Protection of Small Animals announced in the official public website on February 17 that, as community control in Wuhan became more and more strict, volunteers were unable to travel or enter their neighborhoods.
2月19日，澎湃新闻联系了武汉市小动物协会，会长杜帆告诉记者：“2月10日，武汉新冠肺炎防控指挥部发布了一个“第12号”文件后，我们得到了小区的通知：居民每家3天只可安排一人出小区采购生活物资，出行必须有居民临时出入证，车辆通行必须有单位证明，居民和车辆的出行都必须到社区进行备案。
"On February 10, Wuhan Xinguan Pneumonia Control and Prevention Command issued a" No. 12 "document, we were informed that residents can only arrange one person per family three days to purchase living materials, travel must have a temporary resident pass, vehicles must have a unit certificate, residents and vehicles must travel to the community for the record.
”杜帆说，为了方便紧急情况能外出，协会志愿者们在第一时间就前往社区进行备案登记，同时还做了工作证明。
To facilitate emergency travel, Du said volunteers first went to the community to register and certify their work.
收到小区管控的通知后，杜帆立刻去办理了临时出入通行证 武汉小动物保护协会 图志愿者第一时间办理了工作证明。
After receiving the notice of community control, Du Fan immediately went to the temporary access pass Wuhan Association for the Protection of Small Animals map volunteers first processed the work certificate.
武汉小动物保护协会 图两天后，疫情防控再次升级。

据《楚天都市报》2月16日报道，武汉市洪山区开始实行全封闭管理，其中对小区内有新冠肺炎确诊患者或疑似患者所在楼栋一律实行封控管理，禁止出入楼栋，而小区其他居民除特殊需求，不得出入小区。
The Hongshan District of Wuhan, which has been under closed management since February 16, has imposed a ban on all buildings housing newly diagnosed or suspected cases of New Crown Pneumonia and on access to buildings, while other residents of the district are not allowed to enter or leave the district except for special needs.
“原本还可以三天出去一次，但升级通知发出后，基本上就更难外出了。
"I could have gone out three days ago, but basically it was harder to get out after the promotion was given.
但求助信息还源源不断到来。
But help is still coming.
现在我们每天还能收到二三十条求助信息。
Now we get twenty or thirty calls a day.
其中有不少是我们之前已经去过一次，但又到了需要补充水和食物的时间。
Many of them we've been there once before, but it's time to replenish the water and food.
”杜帆说。
"said Du Fan.
为了解决这个问题，杜帆开始呼吁在外地的求助者们尽可能地寻找邻里街坊互帮互助。
To solve this problem, Tu Fan began to appeal to the outbound patrons to look for neighbors to help each other as much as possible.
“我们有一个'武汉微邻里'的小程序和‘邻居帮帮忙：宠物互助平台’网站，我们现在能做的就是把求助者们引到这些平台上，让他们在里面寻找同小区的街坊领居来帮助。
"What we have at & apos; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot
”目前的办法是求助者可以登录宠物互助平台寻求邻里互助不过，对于互助平台是否真的能起到有效的作用，杜帆表示这是非常时期的无奈之举，是目前唯一可行的办法。
The current approach is for people to log on to pet help platforms to seek mutual help in their neighborhoods. But to see if mutual help platforms really work, says Du Fan, who says this is the only way to do so in these difficult times.
“比较麻烦的情况是，一些住户把钥匙带走了，所以即便上门也进不去，需要找开锁师傅来开门。
"The more troublesome situation is that some residents take their keys away, so even the door won't be able to get in and they need to find a locksmith to open it.
但现在在小区封锁的情况下，很难办到。
But now in the case of the small block, it is difficult to do so.
”许多求助案例都需要开门师傅来开锁，这也造成上门帮扶的难度加大。
Many help cases require the door-keeper to unlock, which makes it more difficult to help.
武汉小动物保护协会 图“我们目前救助的动物90%是猫，猫一星期不吃的话可能还能撑一会，但是其他的动物，如小香猪、兔子、仓鼠等等，情况就比较麻烦。
Wuhan Animal Protection Association Map: "We currently save 90% of animals are cats, cats may not eat a week can stay, but other animals such as pigs, rabbits, hamsters, and so on, the situation is more troublesome.
”杜帆认为如果情况持续下去，得不到改善，猫狗在家中死亡并且尸体腐烂可能会造成一些新的污染，这样对于住户家庭或者小区来说也不太安全。
If the situation persists and does not improve, Du believes that the death of dogs and cats at home and the decay of corpses could create some new pollution, which would be less safe for households or small communities.
据了解， 自“封城”以来，武汉小动物协会总共收到4200多个求助，登记在册的申请有1400多个，68名志愿者和工作人员通过17天的努力，完成无偿上门服务1400多次。
It is understood that since the closure of the city, Wuhan Small Animals Association has received more than 4,200 requests for help, registered more than 1,400 applications, 68 volunteers and staff through 17 days of efforts to complete more than 1,400 pro bono services.
同时通过QQ群，微信群协助完成2800多户，总共为将近5000只动物（猫狗，小香猪，兔子，蛇，鸟，鱼，仓鼠，龙猫等）补充食物和水。
At the same time, through the QQ group, micro-groups helped complete more than 2,800 households, a total of nearly 5,000 animals (cats, dogs, pigs, rabbits, snakes, birds, fish, hamsters, dragons, etc.) to supplement food and water.
杜帆表示，目前协会仍在与有关部门沟通，但目前还没有得到回复。
Tu said the association was still in communication with the relevant departments, but so far has not received a response.
