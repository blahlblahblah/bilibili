澎湃新闻记者 李思文 实习生 李娴在武汉“封城”的第21天，滞留在天门市10多天的焦燕（化名）带着儿子返回了武汉，解决了为儿子购买癫痫药品的燃眉之急。
Peng Pai journalist Li Siwen intern Li Xian in Wuhan "closed the city" on the 21st day, stranded in Tianmen City more than 10 days with his son returned to Wuhan, solved the urgent need to buy epileptic drugs for his son.
此前，2月4日，武汉曾发布《疫情防控期间在外人员返汉工作实施方案》，但具体实施细则没有下来，焦燕一度非常焦急。
Before that, on February 4, Wuhan had issued "During the prevention and control of the epidemic in the work of returning to the Han Dynasty", but concrete implementation details did not come down, Jiao Yan was very anxious at one time.
2月11日、12日、13日，武汉市江岸区、江汉区、武昌区等多个区陆续发布了“返汉申请”通知，并公布了详细的申请流程，给滞留在外的武汉人带来了返家的希望。
On February 11, 12 and 13, Wuhan city, Jianghan region, Wuchang District and other districts issued a series of "Application for Return to Han" notice, and published detailed application procedures, to stranded Wuhan people brought hope of returning home.
武汉汉阳区发布的返汉申请表在备齐了必须的各种材料文件后，焦燕还附上一份关于儿子病情的情况说明，2月11日当天完成返汉申请手续，顺利返回。
Wuhan Hanyang District issued the return of Han application forms in the necessary documents, Jiao Yan also attached a description of his son's illness, February 11 to complete the return of the application procedures, smooth return.
但另一位老家同在天门市的慢性乙肝患者谢韵（化名），在2月11日递交申请材料后暂未获通过，手头的药却已经用完。
But Xie Yun (not his real name), another chronic hepatitis B patient from Tianmen City, failed to pass the application on Feb. 11 and ran out of medicine.
作为第一批申请人，谢韵认为除了希望加快速度，目前返汉申请中有些流程也可以优化，建议能开通网上办理、简化审批流程。
As one of the first applicants, Xie Yun believed that in addition to hoping to speed up the process, some of the current applications can also be optimized, the proposal can open online processing, simplify the approval process.
封城超预期，滞留异地药难求1月19日，武汉焦燕一家带着孩子回到了老家天门市过新年。
On January 19, the family of Wuhan Jiaoyan returned to their hometown of Tianmen City for the New Year with their children.
焦燕的儿子在出生时就患有癫痫，长期使用武汉同济医院的一种自制药。
Jiao Yan's son was born with epilepsy, long-term use of Wuhan Tongji Hospital of a self-medication.
在离开武汉之前，焦燕专门去医院给儿子多开了几天的药，“当时我们计划是初八返回武汉，就比这个日子多开了两三天的药，算着是足够了。
Before leaving Wuhan, Jiao Yan went to the hospital to prescribe more medicines for her son for a few days. "At that time, we planned to return to Wuhan on the eighth day of junior high school.
”焦燕说。
"said Jiao Yan.
老家同在天门市的谢韵是一名慢性乙肝患者，每个月都要去武汉中部战区总医院开一种名为“博路定恩替卡韦”的药物。
Xie Yun, who lives in Tianmen City, is a chronic hepatitis B patient who goes to Wuhan's central war zone general hospital every month to prescribe a drug called "Borodine Ntekawi."
这个药她已经服用了7年多，如果擅自停药或忘记吃药，会导致肝功能异常，转氨酶迅速升高，严重时危及生命安全。
She has been taking the drug for more than seven years, and if she stops taking it or forgets to take it, it can lead to abnormal liver function, a rapid increase in transaminase, and serious danger to life.
1月22日，谢韵和家人按照原计划返回了位于天门市的乡下老家，当时他们尚不知疫情的发展形势。
On January 22, Xie and her family returned to their hometown in Tianmen, where they did not know how the epidemic was developing.
为了保险起见，他们计划在老家停留9天，谢韵特意将一天服用一颗的药带了12颗，即使有事耽搁一两日，她觉得也是够的。
To be on the safe side, they plan to stay in their hometown for nine days. Xie Yun took one pill a day and took 12, even if it took a day or two.
然而返乡的次日，武汉便传来了“封城”的消息。
However, the day after the return, Wuhan came to the "closure" of the news.
“我们长居武汉，从来没有发生过这样的事，也没想过会那么严重。
"We live in Wuhan, has never happened such a thing, did not think that it would be so serious.
”谢韵说，她原本以为“封城”数日就可以“解封”，然而疫情发展越来越严重。
Xie Yun said she thought the city could be unsealed in a few days, but the epidemic was getting worse.
“封城”让焦燕和谢韵滞留天门，日子一天天过去，剩下的药却越来越少。
"Seal the city" let Jiao Yan and Xie Yun stay in Tianmen, day by day, the remaining medicine is less and less.
谢韵先将一天一颗的药量减至两天一颗。
Xie Yun first reduced the amount of one pill a day to one for two days.
1月31日，她从老家所在的村镇步行一个多小时到天门市区，寻找了多家药店，都没有买到该类药品。
On 31 January, she walked more than an hour from her home town to the Tianmen district, looking for several pharmacies, none of which were available.
因地处偏僻，快递无法到达，在网上购药的方法也不可行，谢韵又将药量减至三天一颗。
Because of the remote location, express delivery can not reach, online drug purchase methods are not feasible, Xie Yun will reduce the amount of drugs to one three-day.
尽管如此，到11日，她手头的药已经全部服完。
By the 11th, however, she had taken all the medicine in her possession.
焦燕一家的情况也相同，儿子的药物也所剩无几。
The same is true of the Jiaoyan family, whose son has little medicine left.
因为急需用药，焦燕和谢韵都时刻关注着返汉政策。
Because of the urgent need for medicine, Jiao Yan and Xie Yun are always concerned about Han reversion policy.
2月4日，武汉市新冠肺炎防控指挥部办公室曾发布《疫情防控期间在外人员返汉工作实施方案》（以下简称《实施方案》），公布了在外人员返汉的相关政策。
On February 4, the office of Wuhan Xinguan Pneumonia Control and Prevention Command issued the Implementation Plan for the Work of Returnees during the Prevention and Control of Outsiders (hereinafter referred to as the Implementation Plan), and promulgated the relevant policies on the return of foreign personnel.
看到《实施方案》后，焦燕丈夫开始在天门市办理相关材料，2月8日，焦燕向武汉的家所在社区提交了申请，但社区表示并不清楚具体申请流程。
Seeing the implementation plan, her husband began processing materials in Tianmen City. On February 8, she submitted an application to her home community in Wuhan, but the community said it was not aware of the specific application process.
同日，谢韵也向社区提出了返汉申请，收到的回复是“暂无申请模板”。
On the same day, Xie Yun also submitted a return application to the community and received a reply that "there is no application template."
武汉各区政府出台返汉细则，回家之路现转机2月11日，武汉江汉区一名社区工作人员向澎湃新闻表示，此前因流程不清晰、资料不齐全等情况，部门返汉人员申请受阻。
Wuhan government issued regulations on the return of Han, the road home is turning February 11, Wuhan Jianghan District, a community worker told the roar news, because the process is unclear, incomplete information, and other circumstances, departments back Han staff application blocked.
“现在我们区已经出台了具体的返汉流程，有需要的可以重新申请，我们会尽快处理的。
"Now our district has issued a specific return to the Han process, need to re-apply, we will deal with as soon as possible.
”自当日起，武汉市江岸区、江汉区、武昌区等多个区陆续发布通知，允许在外人员返回武汉，并公布了返汉申请的具体流程及申请表模板。
Since the same day, various districts in Wuhan, JiangHan and Wuchang districts have issued notices allowing expatriates to return to Wuhan, and have published detailed procedures and application forms for returning to the Han Dynasty.
这是自武汉“封城”以来，各区首次明确人员返汉的具体细则。
This is since Wuhan "seal city", each district for the first time clear personnel return to Han specific rules.
焦燕通过亲戚向所在社区提供了一家人健康状况和隔离了14天以上的健康证明，由武汉所在社区盖章后，再提交给街道办，街道办盖章后，焦燕网上预约一名外卖配送员，帮她将文件送到区政府，等待区政府盖章。
Jiao Yan provided her community with a family health certificate that had been isolated for more than 14 days through relatives. After being sealed by the local community in Wuhan, it was then submitted to a street office. After the street office sealed it, Jiaoyan made an appointment with a delivery agent to help her send the documents to the district government for seal.
因儿子情况特殊，焦燕在提交文件时也附上一张情况说明，11日即完成返汉申请的所有手续。
Due to her son's special circumstances, Jiao Yan also attached an information note to the submission of the documents, 11 that is, the completion of all formalities for the return of Han application.
2月11日晚，焦燕一家人立即从天门启程回到武汉。
On the night of Feb. 11, the family set off for Wuhan from Tianmen Square.
她告诉澎湃新闻，目前同济医院还没有开门，但应该不久就能购买药物，“我们已经准备了很多生活必需品，再加上现在武汉的网上商城也还在运营，生活是能够有保障的。
She told the roar news that Tongji Hospital had not yet opened, but should be able to buy drugs soon. "We have already prepared a lot of necessities, and now Wuhan online shopping mall is also operating, life can be guaranteed.
”焦燕同时表示，自己和家人会按要求在社区报到后，在家自行隔离十四天。
Ms. Jiao also said she and her family would be asked to report to the community and remain in isolation for 14 days.
11日晚，谢韵所在的社区也收到了洪山区发布的细则。
On the night of the 11th, Xie Yun's community also received the by-laws issued by Hongshan District.
谢韵再次提交了返汉申请，13日被告知已经将申请提交给街道办。
Xie Yun again submitted the return of Han application, 13 was informed that the application has been submitted to the street office.
但停药2日让谢韵很担心，“我之前停过药，导致转氨酶迅速升高到2000多，要紧急住院治疗，现在很害怕。
But the 2-day suspension worried Xie Yun. "I stopped taking the drug before, resulting in a rapid rise in transaminase to more than 2,000 people, emergency hospitalization, now very scared.
”作为第一批申请人，谢韵认为目前返汉申请中有些流程可以进一步优化，“现在申请流程很复杂，而且有些文件都需要出门去办理，像我们天门市需要区政府的章和健康证明，都要到外面去，也增加了感染的风险。
As one of the first applicants, Ms Xie believes some of the processes in the current return applications could be further optimized. "The complexity of the application process and the fact that some documents need to be processed outside the city, such as our Tianmen City, which requires a district government chapter and health certificate, also increases the risk of infection.
”她建议能开通网上办理、简化审批流程。
She suggested opening the door to online processing and simplifying the approval process.
13日，澎湃新闻就谢韵申请返汉一事联系了洪山区关山街道，该街道党宣办负责人称，在11日接到区文件后，关山街道立刻将文件转发给了街道有关的群，并通知社区去落实文件，现在街道和社区都已经清楚了解申请返汉的相关流程。
After receiving the district documents on the 11th, Guan Shan Street immediately forwarded the documents to the relevant street groups and informed the community to implement the documents. The streets and communities now have a clear understanding of the relevant procedures for returning to Han, the spokesman said.
“我们今天（13日）上午已经把第一批申请表交到区里了，等待区里的审核。
"We sent the first batch of applications to the district this morning [13] and are waiting for the district to review them.
”该负责人说，目前第一批申请共计50余人，预计两三天内能完成审批。
The director said the first batch of applications, with more than 50 applicants, was expected to be completed within two or three days.
关山街道还将于第二天反馈此前一天的返汉申请，持续配合返汉工作的开展。
Guanshan Street will be the next day feedback on this day's return to the Han application, continue to cooperate with the implementation of Han work.
该负责人介绍道，除了对保障疫情防控必需、公共事业运行必需、群众生活必需等防疫单位从业人员，是由用人单位负责提出申请外，其他返汉人员皆需要申请人自主申请，确实需要出门准备一些材料，“目前是先写申请表，并且出示健康证明向社区提出申请，社区汇总到街道，街道再向区里面申请。
"In addition to the employees of epidemic prevention units who are necessary for epidemic prevention and control, necessary for the operation of public services and necessary for the livelihood of the masses, the employing unit is responsible for applying for epidemic prevention.
