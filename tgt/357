记者/魏晓涵 实习记者/陈威敬编辑/刘汨宋建华孝感市第一人民医院的医生拆下文件袋作为保护面罩年初三下午5点，王隆和同事在湖北襄阳去往河南新乡的路上，已经连续开了7个小时车。
Reporter / Wei Xiaohan Intern / Editors Chen Weijin / Liu Mi Song Jianhua Xiaoyan City First People's Hospital Doctors removed the file bags as a protective mask On Wednesday afternoon at 5pm, Wang Longand his colleagues had been driving for seven hours on their way to Xinxiang, Henan Province, Hubei Province.
目的地有一家防护服的生产厂，称可以为他们提供几百套医用防护服。
Destination of a protective clothing factory, said they can provide hundreds of sets of medical protective clothing.
王隆是襄阳市下属一家县医院的医生，作为该县唯一收治新型肺炎发热病人的医院，这里收治了40多例疑似病例，而医院储备的防护服只剩下五六十套，“只够再穿两天”。
Wang Longsheng, a doctor at a county hospital in Xiangyang, is the only hospital in the county that treats patients suffering from a new type of pneumonia fever. More than 40 suspected cases have been treated.
许多武汉周边的市县定点医院正在遭遇同样的困境。
Many city and county hospitals around Wuhan are experiencing the same dilemma.
截至1月27日，有超过百家湖北省地级市、县级市的医院向社会发出求助，N95防护口罩、医用防护服、护目镜、呼吸机等等，都在求助物资之列。
As of January 27, more than 100 hospitals at prefectural and county levels in Hubei Province had sent out help to the society, and N95 face masks, medical protective clothing, goggles, respirators and so on were among the help materials.
如果不是这次突然的疫情，王隆所在的县市级医院通常备有500套左右的防护服。
If it had not been for the sudden outbreak, the county-level hospital where Wang Long is based would normally have had about 500 suits.
从腊月二十三返乡人潮进入襄阳开始，疫情的严重情况急转直下，防护物资被迅速消耗。
From the twenty-third return to the beginning of the influx of people into Xiangyang, the serious situation of the epidemic rapidly downward, protective materials were quickly consumed.
困难还不止这些，从发热门诊、医疗防护、病毒检验到隔离防治，从武汉流出的百万回乡大军，考验着这些城市和乡镇的医疗响应机制。
The difficulties range from fever clinics and medical care to virus testing to containment, with millions returning from Wuhan to test the health-care response in these cities and townships.
武汉及周边城市的疫情形势（截至1月28日）一套防护服，几人轮流穿1月26日，孝感市中心医院的许多医生在肺炎疫情发生后，第一次穿上了让他们安心的防护服。
Wuhan and surrounding cities (as of January 28) A set of protective clothing, several people rotating through January 26, Xiaogan City Central Hospital many doctors after the outbreak of pneumonia, for the first time to put on their peace of mind protective clothing.
这批物资来自社会捐赠，一共500套，够医院使用两三天。
The supplies came from a social donation of 500 units, enough for two or three days of hospital use.
此前几天，发热门诊的医生们甚至没有足够的口罩使用，一个N95口罩要佩戴14个小时，外科口罩每个医生一天能分配到两个。
Doctors at the fever clinic didn't even have enough masks for 14 hours on a N95 mask and two on each doctor a day.
“现在的物资肯定是优先供给武汉。
"Now the supplies must be given priority to Wuhan.
”一位湖北省地级市定点医院的医生告诉深一度记者。
A doctor at a designated local hospital in Hubei province told the once-in-a-lifetime reporter.
在疫情最集中的武汉市，最先传出防护服、护目镜、口罩等防护设备不足的消息，医院的求助在网络上传播。
In Wuhan, where the epidemic is concentrated, protective clothing, goggles, masks and other protective equipment were first reported, and hospital help spread on the Internet.
据新华社的消息，截至1月28日，湖北省已筹集并配送给武汉等地566.33万只口罩和10.64万套医用防护服。
As of January 28, Hubei Province had raised and distributed 5.663,300 surgical masks and 106,400 medical suits to Wuhan and other places, according to Xinhua.
武汉周边各地级市、县级市防护设备的不足也逐渐显露。
Wuhan around the city, county-level city protection equipment deficiencies are also gradually exposed.
深一度记者询问黄冈市、荆州市、孝感市、大冶市等多家医院了解到，通常一家定点收治肺炎病人的三甲医院，对防护服的需求量每天在100至150套之间，口罩的缺口以万为单位。
Once a reporter asked Huanggang City, Jingzhou, Xiaogan City, Daye City, and other hospitals learned that usually a designated hospital for pneumonia patients, the need for protective clothing between 100 and 150 sets a day, the gap in masks in tens of thousands.
截至1月25日，许多医院收到的支援物资有限。
As at 25 January, many hospitals had received limited support materials.
据医护人员介绍，这些防护设备不仅要供给发热门诊，还要供给其他科室。
According to the medical staff, these protective equipment should not only supply the fever clinic, but also supply other departments.
孝感市第一人民医院的工作人员介绍，他们收到的一些物资并不符合医用标准。
Staff at the First People's Hospital in Xiaogan City said some of the supplies they received did not meet medical standards.
“比如我们的N95口罩，必须具备医疗器械注册证，防护用品必须是医疗级的。
"For example, our N95 mask must have a medical device registration certificate and the protective equipment must be of medical grade.
医院在联系加班加点生产、调配物资，因为是春节，能够开工的工厂不多。
Hospitals are working overtime to produce and dispatch materials, because it is Spring Festival, can start the factory is not many.
”再向下一级，物资的缺乏更严重，也更难被看到。
Further down, the lack of supplies is more severe and more difficult to see.
云梦县是孝感市下属的县级市，目前已经有两名确诊病例，据县里接收肺炎病人的定点医院医护人员介绍，因为物资不够，她所在科室因为不是发热门诊，每人每天只发放一个外科口罩，而防护服只有一套，几个医生轮换着穿。
Yunmeng County is a county-level city under Xiaogan City, there have been two confirmed cases, according to the county hospital staff receiving pneumonia patients, because of lack of supplies, her department because not hot clinic, each person issued only one surgical mask per day, whereas only one suit of protective clothing, several doctors rotation wear.
N95口罩医生也买不到，只能对外募捐。
The N95 mask won't be available. He'll have to raise money.
“不久后，我们科室的医生也将被抽调，到发热门诊轮岗。
"Before long, the doctors in our department will also be transferred to the fever clinic.
”她说。
'she said.
返乡大潮之下的发热门诊手握两三个口罩的医生，需要面对的是每天涌向发热门诊的几百个病人，其中包含数量不明的疑似病例。
Doctors with two or three face-masks at a fever clinic returning home face hundreds of patients a day, including an unknown number of suspected cases.
截至1月28日，孝感市新型肺炎的确诊病例已经达到274个，成为湖北省继武汉和黄冈之后，确诊病例最多的城市。
By January 28, 274 new cases of pneumonia had been confirmed, making Hubei Province the city with the highest number of confirmed cases after Wuhan and Huanggang.
这些病例和涌向发热门诊的患者大多来自返乡潮。
Most of these cases and the patients arriving at the fever clinic came from the return home.
据统计，在湖北省内，孝感是接收武汉返乡客流比例最高的城市，占13.03%，其次是疫情较严重的黄冈，占12.64%。
According to statistics, in Hubei Province, filial piety is the city receiving the highest proportion of returning Wuhan visitors, accounting for 13.03 percent, followed by Huanggang, with 12.64 percent.
孝感中心医院的发热门诊直接承受着汹涌而来的压力。
The febrile clinic of filial piety center hospital is suffering the pressure that comes from surge directly.
作为孝感市肺炎收治确诊病例的定点医院之一，从外地来支援的医疗队，一半留在了这儿。
As one of the designated hospitals for treating confirmed cases of filial pneumonia, half of the medical teams from other places have stayed here.
返乡潮始于年前一周左右。
The return wave began about a week ago.
1月23日开始，武汉市为防止疫情扩散宣布管控内外交通。
Since January 23, Wuhan city has announced the control of internal and external traffic to prevent the spread of the epidemic.
而在前一天晚上，孝感市中心医院的发热门诊才第一次迎来问诊的人流高峰。
And in the night before, Xiaogan City Central Hospital fever clinic only the first time usher in the peak of the flow of patients.
据知情人士介绍，当晚有急诊科的医生临时被调配去发热门诊，有人没来得及穿防护服，带着外科口罩就上了。
According to people familiar with the matter, doctors from the emergency department were temporarily deployed to the fever clinic that night. Some people went to the clinic without wearing protective clothing and surgical masks.
孝感不是特例，湖北省另一个地级市——荆门市一家定点医院的医生介绍，荆门市的患者大多是来自武汉市返乡的输入性病例。
Filial piety is not a special case. Doctors at a designated hospital in Jingmen, another prefecture-level city in Hubei province, said most of the patients in Jingmen were imported from Wuhan.
1月22日武汉市确诊病例已超过百人，不少没有来得及确诊的病毒携带者流向了地级市。
On January 22, more than 100 cases were diagnosed in Wuhan, and many carriers of the virus did not arrive in time to be diagnosed.
此前地级市的医院没有太多准备，反应滞后了一步。
Before that, the local hospitals did not have much preparation, and the response lagged one step.
从1月22日到1月26日，孝感市中心医院的发热门诊人流，在除夕和大年初一当天达到高峰，有的一线医生持续值了几个班。
From January 22 to January 26, Xiaogan City Central Hospital fever outpatient flow, New Year's Eve and New Year's Day reached a peak, some of the first-line doctors continued to value several classes.
据多家地级市、县级市医院医务人员介绍，发热门诊人员有限，医院大多会征集其他科室的医生作为志愿补充。
According to a number of local, county-level hospital medical staff, fever clinic staff is limited, most hospitals will recruit doctors from other departments as voluntary supplement.
现实是，前来就诊的患者中健康和轻症的患者占了绝大多数。
The reality is that the overwhelming majority of patients with health and mild illness come to the clinic.
据孝感市中心医院的医护人员介绍，发热门诊的就诊量达到平时的3至4倍，高峰期有6倍。
According to hospital staff in Xiaogan City Central Hospital, the calorific clinic visits reached 3-4 times the usual rate, peak 6 times.
“绝大部分是恐慌性的，为求心安前来就诊。
"Most of them are frightened and come to see the doctor for peace.
（来医院）反而提高了交叉感染的可能性。
Instead, it increases the likelihood of cross-infection.
我们拼命宣传，但是作用甚小。
We're pushing hard, but it doesn't work.
”前来发热门诊的人多，等待时间漫长，面对新的疾病隐患心理压力也大。
"More people came to the fever clinic, waiting for a long time, in the face of new hidden dangers of disease psychological stress.
对地市级的居民来说，这并不是就诊的常态。
For residents at the local level, this is not the norm.
而发热门诊临时顶替上的医生经验不足，检验报告打不出来、结果出得慢、难以查询，“医疗上有各种各样的问题，”上述医护人员告诉深一度记者，“病人非常敏感，我们的体力和精神也扛不住了，我从医以来，从来没有见过这样的情景。
"There are all kinds of medical problems," the paramedics told the Sanctuary. "The patient is very sensitive and our energy and spirit can't carry it. I have never seen such a scenario since I was a doctor.
”防护服有限的情况下只能供给发热门诊的医护人员，非发热门诊的医生穿的是厚一些的隔离服，同样有接触到来看急诊的新型肺炎患者的可能。
In cases where protective clothing is limited, it can only be provided to health-care workers at the fever clinic, who wear thicker isolation suits and are also likely to come into contact with patients with new forms of pneumonia who come to emergency care.
湖北省荆州市某下属县级市定点医院的内科医生刘涛就遇到了这样的风险。
Liu Tao, a physician at a county-level hospital in Jingzhou, Hubei Province, is at risk.
1月23日和24日晚，他在急诊内科值班，接待了两名从武汉回乡的发热病人，导诊台直接将两人分到内科而非发热门诊。
On the night of 23 and 24 January, he was on duty at the Emergency Department of Internal Medicine, where he received two febrile patients returning from Wuhan and assigned them directly to internal medicine instead of to the fever clinic.
“他们主要症状是腹泻，导诊台没有足够的应对经验，误判了。
"Their main symptom was diarrhea. The clinic did not have enough experience and was misjudged.
”接诊时只戴了一个口罩的他事后十分紧张，当天做了全身消毒，一天洗了三次澡。
He was only wearing a mask when he was admitted to the clinic and was very nervous afterwards, disinfecting himself the same day and taking three baths a day.
医院接收社会捐赠的公告三甲医院“一站式医疗”的隐忧在发热门诊的问诊流程中，检验科医师可能是距离病毒最近的人，直接从病人的喉咙里取咽拭子，做流感和病毒筛查。
Hospitals Receive Social Donation Notices Sanjia Hospital "One Stop Medical Care" Anxiety During the consultation process at the fever clinic, the examiner may be the closest person to the virus, swabbing a swab directly from the patient's throat for influenza and virus screening.
核酸试剂检测盒用来判断感染肺炎患者的病毒是否属于新型冠状病毒，是目前确诊病例的依据。
Nucleic acid reagent detection box is used to determine whether the virus infected with pneumonia belongs to a new coronavirus.
在武汉之外的湖北其他地区，试剂盒的滞后和短缺成为常见的状况。
In other areas of Hubei Province outside Wuhan, the lag and shortage of test kits have become a common situation.
据媒体报道，距离武汉市最近、地级市中疫情最严重的黄冈市，在1月19日才拿到第一批试剂盒。
According to media reports, the city of Huanggang, the worst hit by the recent outbreak in Wuhan, received its first kits on January 19.
荆门市一家收治新型肺炎患者定点医院的医生告诉记者，直到1月24日晚上，他们才拿到第一批试剂盒。
Doctors at a hospital in Jingmen, which treats patients with new pneumonia, told reporters they did not get the first kits until the evening of January 24.
当晚武汉市的确诊病例已超过了800人，三天后，拿到试剂盒的荆门市，新型肺炎确诊病例升至114人。
More than 800 cases were confirmed that night in Wuhan, and three days later, 114 new cases of pneumonia were confirmed in Jingmen, where the kits were available.
襄阳市某县市级定点医院在1月16日拿到了试剂盒，不同的是，他们直接联系了生产试剂盒的公司购买。
On January 16, a municipal-level hospital in Xiangyang City got a kit, unlike the company that made it.
而下发的试剂盒要抵达县市级医院，过程更漫长。
And the distribution of kits to the county and municipal hospitals, the process is longer.
“一直在申请，但是到现在也没有批下来。
"I've been applying, but so far I haven't approved it.
”上述医院是一家二甲医院，有自己的PCR病毒实验室，可以做病毒筛查，但是涉及到病例的确诊和复核，“需要通过疾控中心来确定”，该医院一名负责人告诉记者。
The hospital, a two-A hospital with its own PCR virus laboratory, can screen for viruses, but the diagnosis and review of cases "need to be determined through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention," a hospital official told reporters.
不是所有的二甲医院都具备病毒实验室。
Not all of the second-degree hospitals have virus labs.
在湖北省，类似上述级别的县级市，收治肺炎病人的定点医院多为二甲医院，因为诊断条件有限，没有做病毒检测的能力。
In Hubei Province, similar to the above-mentioned county level, the hospitals designated to treat pneumonia patients are mostly second-class hospitals because of limited diagnostic conditions and lack of ability to test for the virus.
荆州市下属某县级市定点医院的医生介绍，他们通常经过临床观察、实验室检查、影像学检查对病人进行初步筛查后，将病毒样本送至荆州市具备检验能力的三甲医院进行病毒检验。
Doctors at a county-level designated hospital in Jingzhou city said they usually send samples of the virus to a sanitarium with the ability to test for the virus after initial screening by clinical observation, laboratory tests and imaging examinations.
压力集中在了地市级的三甲医院，不仅要顾及自己医院收治的病毒样本，有的还需处理下属地级市送来的检验样本。
The pressure is concentrated in the city-level Sanjia hospital, not only to take into account their own hospital virus samples, some have to deal with sub-prefectural city sent to test samples.
某地级市的三甲医院检验科医生告诉记者，在发热门诊的人流高峰期，一晚上前来门诊采扎手指取血样的人数达到400例。
Medical examiner of Sanjia hospital in a certain city told reporters that during the rush hour of the fever clinic, the number of people coming to the clinic one night to collect blood samples reached 400.
据了解，该医院采取的是就医一站式服务，分诊、检验、收费、问诊、药房全在一起，所以会直接在大厅对病人进行咽拭子的取样，用于后续的病毒检测。
It is understood that the hospital is a one-stop shop for medical consultations, tests, fees, consultations and pharmacies, so patients are sampled directly in the lobby for follow-up virus detection.
大厅没有条件做隔离，对大厅里所有人来说，都存在巨大的风险。
The hall was not equipped for isolation, and there were great risks for all of us in the hall.
“有极高的感染的可能性，因为大厅里有其他病人。
"There is a very high risk of infection because there are other patients in the lobby.
”对医生也是，上述医院物资的缺乏让他们与病人的距离只剩一只N95口罩。
For doctors, the lack of supplies left them only one N95 mask away from their patients.
“我们穿着隔离服，其实起不到防范病毒的作用。
"We don't actually protect against viruses by wearing quarantine clothing.
这里面没有通风设施，人在里头汗流浃背，一身汗然后就下班。
There was no ventilation, people were sweating profusely, sweating and then leaving work.
”据了解，检验科的医生直接接触患者，按照医院的培训标准应该达到三级防护，即佩戴护目镜、医用口罩，穿上防护服等，但因为防护材料不够，有医生告诉记者，所在三甲医院远远达不到这个标准。
Doctors in the laboratory, who are known to be in direct contact with patients, should be provided with level-III protection in accordance with hospital training standards, such as wearing goggles, medical masks and protective clothing, but due to insufficient protective materials, doctors told reporters the hospital was far from meeting the standard.
连续工作导致医护人员免疫力下降，出现有人咳嗽的情况，医院要求他们在家进行自我隔离。
Continued work results in reduced immunity for health-care workers, who are required to isolate themselves at home in the event of a cough.
同样担心在医院门诊交叉感染的还有向瑜，她的母亲刚被确诊为新型肺炎。
Also worried about cross-infection at the hospital is Xiang Yu, whose mother has just been diagnosed with new pneumonia.
1月23日下午她带着妈妈去湖北省随州市中心医院发热门诊，发热病人没有走专门的通道，所有人都混在同一条队伍里，等待做CT。
January 23 afternoon she took her mother to the central hospital in Suizhou City, Hubei Province, the fever patients did not take a special passageway, all of them mixed in the same line, waiting for CT.
拿到CT结果已经是晚上7点，发热门诊当天五点已经下班了，所有的病人都在另一栋楼的急诊大厅里等着医生看诊。
It was 7 p. m., the fever clinic closed at 5 p. m., and all the patients were waiting for a doctor in the emergency room in another building.
问诊的环境让她担忧。
The environment in which she consulted worried her.
“病人太多了，也不是所有人都戴口罩。
"There are too many patients and not all of them wear masks.
当时发热门诊也没有提醒，只是在玻璃门上贴了一张湖北省关于疫情通知的红头文件。
At that time, the fever clinic also did not remind, only in the glass door posted a Hubei Province on the notification of the outbreak of the red file.
”医生使用试剂盒检测病毒样本紧张的床位和不完全的隔离1月23日晚上11点，还未确诊的向瑜母亲住上了随州市中心医院文帝院区最后一个收治疑似病例的床位。
Doctors used kits to detect strained beds and incomplete isolation of viral samples. At 11 p.m. on January 23, an undiagnosed mother was admitted to the last bed in the Wendi courtyard of the central hospital in Suizhou Province to treat suspected cases.
在去往住院部的路上，她听到医院住院部的护士在打电话，情绪有些激动：“今天医生护士一天都没下班，收了39个病人，实在是太忙了。
On her way to the inpatient department, she heard the hospital nurse on the phone, feeling a little excited. "Today, the doctor and nurse stayed up all day to take in 39 patients.
”在随州市中心医院，病人是否需要收治需要经过住院部医生的判断。
In the central hospital in Suizhou, inpatient decisions are needed on whether patients need treatment.
向瑜在办公室见到住院部医生的时候，他未佩戴任何防护工具，在看完向瑜母亲的诊断结果之后，同意她住院，并迅速戴上口罩。
When Yu met the inpatient in his office, he did not wear any protective tools and, after reviewing the results of his diagnosis of Yu's mother, agreed to her hospitalization and quickly put on a mask.
随后向瑜的母亲住进了病房，病房里有四个床位，其它三个已经住满，她住进了临时加的最后一个床位。
She was admitted to her mother's ward, which had four beds, and three others were occupied. She was admitted to the last temporary bed.
1月26日检查结果出来，病房里有两人并非新型肺炎，被转移到了别的病房。
On January 26, two people in the ward were transferred to another ward for what appeared to be a new pneumonia.
医生刘涛告诉记者，他所在的市将一家医院全部腾空作为隔离病房收治疑似和确诊病例。
Doctor Liu Tao told reporters that his city vacated a hospital as an isolation ward to treat suspected and confirmed cases.
原医院的病人有的回了家，有的被转移到了另外的医院。
Patients from the former hospital either returned home or were transferred to another hospital.
整家医院的收治容量大概在100人左右，原因是病房数量有限，按照标准，一个病房只能收治一个病人。
The hospital has a capacity of about 100, due to the limited number of wards, which by standard can accommodate only one patient per ward.
其他市级医院也有类似的做法。
Similar practices exist in other municipal hospitals.
在孝感市下属的云梦县，因为定点医院的感染科病床不够，有的医院临时增加了一个病区，将别的科室改为发热科。
In Yunmeng County, which is subordinate to Xiaogan City, some hospitals have temporarily added a sick area because there are not enough beds for infection in designated hospitals.
荆州市第一人民医院年前已经腾出了两层楼作为发热病区。
The first people's hospital in Jingzhou vacated two floors a year ago as a febrile area.
而据荆州市中心医院的一位医生介绍，年后他所在的科室也可能转为发热病房。
But according to a doctor at the central hospital in Jingzhou, his department may also turn into a fever ward after five years.
配套资源的短缺也在同时间暴露。
Shortages of complementary resources are also being exposed over time.
向瑜的母亲确诊后，向瑜有些着急——妈妈的情况不太好，不能走动、站不稳、走路会喘，打热水、热饭、上厕所也没有人可以帮忙。
After her mother was diagnosed with yoga, she was in a very bad condition, unable to walk, unable to stand on her feet, gasping for breath, or having hot water, hot food, or going to the toilet.
没人照顾她的饮食起居，家属没有防护服进不去。
No one cared for her food and her family could not get in without protective clothing.
她和医生协商后，最终同意为她提供一套防护服，让她进入。
After consultation with the doctor, she finally agreed to provide her with a suit of protective clothing to allow her to enter.
赵涵的焦虑更难以解决。
Zhao Han's anxiety is even more intractable.
他的女朋友在湖北省鄂州市因疑似新型肺炎的症状被收治住院，医生开出的药品清单里，有一种名为阿比多尔的药物医院没有储备，他找遍了鄂州市所有的药店也没有。
His girlfriend was hospitalized in Huizhou City, Hubei province, for suspected symptoms of a new type of pneumonia, and a drug hospital called Abidor, which doctors had ordered, was out of stock and he searched all the pharmacies in Huizhou.
同时委托武汉的朋友帮忙打听，才了解到在武汉需要患者携带身份证才能限购，每人一到两盒。
At the same time commissioned Wuhan friends to help inquire, only to learn that in Wuhan patients need to carry identity cards to limit the purchase, each one or two boxes.
直到确诊后，他的女朋友被转到定点医院，医院才向确诊病人限量发放阿比多尔。
It was not until the diagnosis that his girlfriend was transferred to a designated hospital, where a limited number of patients were given Abidor.
资源有限的情况下，医院通常建议轻症病患回家自行隔离。
When resources are limited, hospitals usually recommend that light patients go home and isolate themselves.
刘涛所在的医院就因此出现过意外，他在开会培训时了解到，所在市的一例确诊病患第一次就诊的时候，曾被医生建议“回家自行隔离”。
Liu Tao's hospital had an accident, and he learned during the training session that a confirmed patient in his city had been advised by his doctor to "go home and isolate himself."
对基层的医生而言，工作中随时存在风险，刘涛有一部分压力来自同事。
For doctors at the grass-roots level, there are always risks at work, and some of Liu Tao's stress comes from his colleagues.
“比如防护服，不是一脱一穿就可以了，穿脱都要经过严格的消毒。
"For example, protective clothing, not one off can be put on, wear through strict disinfection.
”看到有些同事不细致的消毒流程，刘涛很担心。
"Liu Tao was worried when he saw that some of his colleagues did not carefully disinfect the process.
他解释：“我们这样县市级医院的一员，之前没有遇到过这么大的疫情，说实话，更专业的医生肯定去更好的医院了，小地方这方面意识确实不够。
"As a member of a county-level hospital like ours, we haven't had such a big outbreak before, and to be honest, more professional doctors definitely go to better hospitals," he explained.
