在欧洲人的眼中，没有病症的人戴口罩出门好比穿病号服逛街。
In the eyes of Europeans, going out in a mask is like going shopping in a sick suit.
文 |周　顺瑞士是和意大利交界边境线最长的国家，从意大利2月21日第一起病例出现，瑞士意大利语区的提契诺州（Ticino）就有民众呼吁关闭边境，但截至3月13日，瑞士才开始了边境管控措施，只是为时已晚。
Rousseau Chou is the longest country on the Italian border. The first case occurred on February 21, when people in Ticino, the Italian-speaking region of Switzerland, called for the border to be closed. But by March 13, Switzerland had only begun border controls too late.
除了远程办公，生活基本正常3月20日据瑞士卫生部网站消息，截至当地时间3月20日中午12时，瑞士新冠肺炎累计确诊病例达到4176例，累计死亡43例。
By 12: 00 noon local time on March 20, the total number of confirmed cases of pneumonia in Switzerland had reached 4,176, with a cumulative total of 43 deaths, according to the Swiss Health Ministry website.
从2月25日至今二十多天，确诊病例呈几何数增长。
From 25 February to more than 20 days, the number of confirmed cases has increased geometrically.
但时至今日，瑞士民众依旧淡定，人们和往常一样享受着日内瓦湖畔明媚春光。
But to this day, the Swiss people are still calm, people as usual enjoy the sunny side of the lake in Geneva.
和绝大多数欧洲民众一样，大家没有佩戴口罩出门的习惯。
Like most Europeans, people are not in the habit of wearing masks.
在欧洲人的眼中，没有病症的人戴口罩出门好比穿病号服逛街。
In the eyes of Europeans, going out in a mask is like going shopping in a sick suit.
瑞士在3月5号正式开始全国通告执行卫生防疫措施，但这些防护建议相对有限，个人防护仅仅倡议勤洗手和避免肢体接触，出现疑似症状建议在家自我隔离，通过电话联系医疗机构进行咨询，这些有限警示只是让自律的瑞士人开始购买消毒洗手液，并没有停止社会和经济活动。
Switzerland officially launched a national circular on 5 March to implement anti-epidemic measures, but these are relatively limited. Personal protection only advocates frequent hand-washing and avoidance of physical contact, self-isolation at home is recommended for suspected symptoms, and consultations with medical institutions are only limited reminders that self-regulating Swiss are starting to buy disinfectant hand sanitizers and are not ceasing social and economic activity.
所幸，瑞士良好的医疗体制和设施能够确保病人得到有效救治，3月13日，瑞士联邦政府根据疫情发展，做出了一系列更严格的管控举措。
Fortunately, Switzerland's good health-care system and facilities are able to ensure that patients are treated effectively, and on 13 March the Swiss Federal Government introduced a series of stricter controls in response to the outbreak.
从全欧洲的疫情发展看，瑞士各个联邦州将紧跟邻国，开启抄作业模式。
In the light of developments across Europe, Switzerland's federal states will follow their neighbours and start copying operations.
截至目前瑞士超市还没有出现严重抢购潮，大部分日常食品及用品供应充足，本地居民生活受影响不大。
So far there has been no major rush in Swiss supermarkets, most of the daily food and supplies are in sufficient supply and the lives of local residents have been little affected.
由于提倡远程办公，公共交通工具乘客大幅减少。
The promotion of telecommuting has led to a significant reduction in public transport passengers.
数天前，国际媒体普遍报道瑞士医疗物资被扣的新闻，其实只是德瑞海关沟通中所出现的小插曲，一方面是德国早已把医疗物资视作战略储备，另一方面瑞士作为内陆国家，采购物资转运必须经过德法意这些周边近邻，货物转运容易出现协调问题。
The news of the seizure of medical supplies in Switzerland was widely reported in the international media a few days ago. On the one hand, Germany already regards medical supplies as a strategic reserve, while on the other hand, as a landlocked country, Switzerland has to go through its immediate neighbours, Germany, France and Italy, where transit of goods is prone to coordination problems.
但真正令人担忧的，还是瑞士的口罩类防护用品，大量药店处于口罩断货至第三季度，而一旦欧洲疫情继续蔓延，空运可能是未来解决瑞士医疗防护物资调配的唯一途径。
But what is really worrying is that Swiss respirators, many of which were out of stock until the third quarter, could be the only way to solve the problem in the future once the epidemic in Europe continues to spread.
疫情之下，国际奥委会及大批国际机构和企业都已经陆续开始倡议在家远程办公，禁止出差和面对面会晤。
As a result of the epidemic, the IOC and a large number of international organizations and enterprises have begun to advocate telecommuting at home, prohibiting business trips and face-to-face meetings.
欧洲未来发展之路，前途未卜，2020年2月底英国正式脱欧，德国默克尔原定接班人AKK辞职，法国总统马克龙2021年的连任尚不明朗，意大利因为疫情导致经济瘫痪。
The way forward for Europe is uncertain, with Brexit officially announced at the end of February 2020, German Chancellor Angela Merkel's intended successor, AKK, resigned, French President François Macron's re-election in 2021 was uncertain, and Italy's economy was paralyzed by the outbreak.
新冠病毒的蔓延趋势之快，已经波及2020年全球经济整体下调增长预期，欧洲经济体主要国家所受冲击日趋严重，意大利已超过4万人感染，法国与德国数据持续走高各自感染人数破万，英国突然颁布的抗疫方案，瑞士、荷兰、比利时等国家每天增长人数众多，这将冲击本已风雨飘摇的欧洲经济和全球产品供应链。
The rapid spread of the new cap virus has spread to the global economy as a whole in 2020, with major European economies hit harder, Italy with more than 40,000 infected, France and Germany with rising numbers of infections, the UK's sudden anti-epidemic programme, and countries such as Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Belgium growing daily, which will hit already shaky European economies and global product supply chains.
3月16日瑞士时间16点，瑞士联邦政府宣布进入国家紧急状态，调用8000军人待命支援医疗体系，法国总统宣布进入战“疫”状态，欧洲历史开启新的一篇。
On March 16, at 16: 00 Swiss time, the Swiss federal government declared a state of emergency, called in 8,000 soldiers to support the medical system, the French president declared a state of war, and European history opened a new chapter.
过去的一个月，从盯着中国到关注意大利我旅居欧洲20余年，由于家庭和工作原因，常于瑞士、法国、中国三地间往返。
In the past month, I have been living in Europe for more than 20 years, from staring at China to Italy. I have been traveling between Switzerland, France and China for family and work reasons.
2019年12月下旬由上海返回巴黎和家人团聚过圣诞节，翌日听闻武汉出现不明疫情，顿生一丝焦虑，料想事态不会如2003年的非典事件般恶化，却一语成谶，更不曾料，时至今日疫情已蔓延成全球化状态。
After returning from Shanghai to Paris in late December 2019 to spend Christmas with his family, the following day witnessed an unexplained outbreak in Wuhan, causing a little anxiety. It is not expected that the situation will worsen like SARS in 2003, but rather that it will become a true story.
一月初，见几个欧洲媒体期刊对中国疫情的简述，和亲友同事在微信上互报平安，各嘱珍重，想着历经SARS疫情之后的当下医疗科技力量，新疫情会很快被控制。
In early January, several European media journals gave a brief account of the situation in China, exchanged letters with friends and colleagues, and asked them to treasure it, thinking about the current medical technology after the SARS epidemic, the new outbreak could soon be contained.
直至1月23日武汉突然凌晨宣布封城，气氛一下子变得紧张起来。
Until January 23, Wuhan announced the sudden early morning closure of the city, the atmosphere suddenly became tense.
那天晚上8点多，手机跳出新闻提示，再翻看朋友圈里十来条关于武汉封城的信息，不禁猛然惊醒，恍然间疫情已经失控。
That night more than 8: 00, the mobile phone jump out of the news, and then read a dozen friends circle about the information about Wuhan, can not help but wake up suddenly, suddenly out of control of the epidemic.
欧洲媒体随即铺天盖地的头版头条疫情报道，而接下来的一周时间，眼看着由武汉封城，转为湖北封省，进而全球各大航空公司停航撤侨，2月就这样在惴惴不安中来临了。
The next week saw Wuhan shut down the city to Hubei province, and then the world's major airlines stopped evacuating overseas Chinese, and thus came in February with trepidation.
2月，瑞士华人社团和中瑞机构筹措资金和防护用品陆续发送至中国，人们不仅讨论因为中国经济的停摆，对全球供应链造成的冲击和巨大影响，同时华人买光瑞士全境口罩也成为了话题。
In February, funds and supplies were sent to China from the Swiss-Chinese community and Swiss-based organizations to discuss not only the impact on global supply chains of China's economic slowdown, but also the need for Chinese people to buy face masks across the country.
连续三周时间，不断接到求购医疗物资的信息，却深感无能为力，药店超市防护口罩全部无货，交通物流航路全部暂停，只能通过微信电话与亲朋好友相互叮嘱鼓励。
For three weeks, continued to receive information about the purchase of medical supplies, but feel powerless, pharmacies supermarket respirators are completely out of stock, traffic logistics routes have been suspended, can only through micro-mail telephone advice and encouragement with relatives and friends.
随着时间转向2月下旬，人们的视线渐渐从中国境内疫情，慢慢转到了“钻石公主号”、韩国本土疫情，以及意大利疫情上。
As time turned to late February, attention gradually shifted from the outbreak in China to the Princess Diamond, an outbreak in South Korea and an outbreak in Italy.
瑞士是最早开始关注中国疫情发展的欧洲国家之一，世卫组织WHO就坐落在日内瓦，关乎全球疫情的讯息都源于此地；瑞士驻华商会也多次组织跨境视频会议，探讨疫情之下如何解决生产复工问题。
Switzerland was one of the first European countries to focus on the development of the epidemic in China, where the World Health Organization is based and from which the global epidemic originates. The Swiss Chamber of Commerce in China has also organized a number of cross-border videoconferences to discuss how to solve the problem of returning to work in the face of the epidemic.
