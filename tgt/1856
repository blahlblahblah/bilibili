本文图片均为受访者供图澎湃新闻此前报道，触发大邱市社区传播并引爆疫情连锁效应的是一名61岁的大邱女性，被韩国疾控部门称为“第31例病例”。
Previously, a 61-year-old Daegu woman, described by South Korea's disease control agency as the "31st case," triggered the epidemic's ripple effects in the Daegu community.
她在出现主症状后曾在大邱市本地前往过公司、多家医院、教会、酒店等多处人员密集场所。
She was in Daegu City after the main symptoms of local companies, a number of hospitals, churches, hotels and other densely populated places.
尤其让人担心的是她曾四次前往当地的新天地教会参加聚会活动。
Of particular concern is the fact that she went to her local church in Xintiandi on four occasions.
据韩国媒体报道，该教会是1984年建立的一个新兴宗教组织。
According to South Korean media, the Church is a new religious organization founded in 1984.
这家教会通常有逾千人参加每周日的礼拜活动，时间持续两个多小时。

聚会中，所有的教徒会在相对密闭的空间内席地而坐，用双臂拥抱彼此的肩膀唱歌。
At parties, all believers sit on the floor in relatively closed spaces, embracing each other's shoulders and singing.
聚会结束后还会在咖啡厅和饭店等地频繁聚集，这种密切的接触，加大了彼此感染和传播病毒的可能性。
The close contact of frequent gatherings at cafes and restaurants increases the likelihood of one another contracting and spreading the virus.
据《东亚日报》22日报道，大邱市政府宣布，当天完成了对新天地教会大邱分会9336名信徒的跟踪调查，其中有1261人已出现感染相关症状，目前还有710人未联系上。
The municipality of Daegu announced that it had completed a follow-up investigation into 9,336 followers of Taegu branch of Xintiandi Church, of whom 1,261 had developed symptoms related to the infection.
据韩国疾控部门调查，触发大邱市疫情的第31例病例的感染途径很可能与邻近的另一主要疫情爆发地清道郡大南医院有关。
According to the Korea CDC investigation, the 31 cases triggering the Daegu epidemic are likely to be linked to another major outbreak nearby, the Chhnang Hospital.
“我们在询问31号病例的活动历史时，发现她有所隐瞒，直到通过手机GPS的移动纪录才发现她在2月初曾前往庆尚北道清道郡的大南医院，却没有通报。
"When we asked about the history of Case No. 31, we found out she had something to hide until we found out through her mobile GPS record that she had gone to Tainan Hospital in Qingdao County, Gyeongshan Province, in early February, but did not report it.
”韩国疾控中心负责人郑恩京20日在接受《韩民族日报》采访时表示。
In an interview with the South Korean National Daily yesterday, the head of the CDC, Cheng Enjing, told the paper.
郑恩京表示，经调查后发现31号病例2月初曾在大南医院内参加了新天地教会创始人李万熙哥哥的葬礼，并在院内接触了一批有过中国旅行史的高风险人士。
Zheng said the investigation revealed that case No. 31 had attended the funeral of Li Wanxi, founder of Xintiandi Church, in early February at the Da Nan Hospital, where he met a group of high-risk people with a history of Chinese travel.
不过疾控部门至今还无法切确证明，31号病例是否是在那里受到感染。
But the CDC has so far been unable to confirm whether Case No. 31 was infected there.

韩国中央应急处置本部副本部长金刚立22日表示，政府决定继续将预警级别维持在第二高的“警惕”级别。
Kim Gang-li, deputy minister of the Central Emergency Management Agency, said Wednesday that the government decided to maintain its alert level at the second-highest "alert" level.
金刚立表示，最高级别的“严重”级别是在全国范围内出现社区传播现象时采取的防疫机制。

另外，金刚立还表示，确诊患者中有1人在使用人工呼吸器，病情危重，另有8人在接受吸氧治疗。
