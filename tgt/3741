燃财经（ID:rancaijing）原创作者 | 闫丽娇编辑 | 周昶帆进入3月，很多行业开始陆续复工，“影视行业何时能复工”依然牵动着很多人。
Yan Lijiao, former creator of Fun Finance (ID: Rancaijing), entered March, when many industries began to resume work. "When will the film and television industry resume work" still touches many people.
在疫情持续蔓延的50多天里，影视行业受到了前所未有的冲击。
In the epidemic continues to spread for more than 50 days, the film and television industry has been unprecedented impact.
贺岁档电影集体宣布撤档，线下影院损失惨重。
New Year's film collective announced the withdrawal of files, movie theaters lost heavily offline.
为自救，一些影院不得不靠“副业”缓解现金流的压力。
To help themselves, some cinemas have had to rely on "sideline" to relieve cash flow pressures.
日前，阿里影业联合饿了么，上线“影院卖品外送服务”。
A few days ago, Ali film industry united hungry, on-line "cinema sells goods delivery service".
影院囤积的爆米花、薯片、可乐等小食最后不得不依靠线上渠道清理库存。
Cinema hoards of popcorn, crisps, cola and other snacks have to rely on online channels to clear the inventory.
2月23日，中国电影发行放映协会发布《关于电影院复工准备的工作建议》，对影院复工提出一些具体建议。
On February 23, the China Film Distribution and Screening Association issued its "Work Proposal for Restarting Work in Cinemas," offering some concrete suggestions for the resumption of cinemas.
但“建议”发布后，引来不少质疑，随后被北京市政府叫停。
But after the "proposal" was issued, it attracted a lot of questions and was then stopped by the Beijing municipal government.
虽然国内已经有部分影院开始复工，但影院何时能全部开放暂时还没有明确的时间表。
Although some cinemas in the country have begun to resume work, there is no clear timetable as to when all theaters will open.
即便影院正常开放，出品方也未必选择在这个时间点上映。
Even if the cinema is open normally, the producer does not necessarily choose to open at this point in time.
此次，全球影视行业都受到了影响，原定4月10日在北美上映的《007：无暇赴死》，已于近日宣布将推迟至11月25日上映。
"007: No Time to Die," originally scheduled for release in North America on April 10, has been postponed to November 25, as the industry has been affected.
即便有片可看，观众也未必会在这时候走进影院。
Even if there is a film to see, the audience will not necessarily enter the cinema at this time.
疫情的影响，几乎传导到了影视行业的每一环。
The impact of the epidemic, almost transmitted to the film and television industry every link.
影视业受到巨大冲击，但不否认影视行业自身也暴露出很多问题。
The film and television industry has suffered a great impact, but does not deny that the film and television industry itself exposed many problems.
中国缺少奈飞（Netflix）、Amazon studio、hulu、Disney+这样的商业模型，依旧在延续传统的影院上映模式。
China lacks business models like Netflix, Amazon Studio, hulu, Disney +, and continues its traditional theatrical model.
一方面是行业的人人自危，另一方面，艰难的行业处境也在倒逼这两年缺乏颠覆性变化的影视行业寻求新出路。
On the one hand, everyone in the industry, on the other hand, the difficult industry situation in these two years without subversive changes in the film and television industry to find a new way out.
3月5日，欢喜传媒发布公告称，集团已与字节跳动展开战略合作，安排院线电影于字节跳动旗下的平台包括但不限于西瓜视频及今日头条等平台上播放。
On March 5, Rejoice Media issued a statement saying it had worked strategically with Byte Beating to arrange for live-action films to be broadcast on platforms such as watermelon videos and today's headlines.
同时，集团旗下“欢喜首映”App的付费用户累计超过了200万。
Meanwhile, the group's Happy Premium App subscribers totaled more than 2 million.
天空之城影业创始人路伟认为，电影《囧妈》与字节跳动的一系列战略合作只是一个拐点，影视行业应该趁机做出更多改变。
Sky City filmmaker Louis Vuitton believes the series of strategic partnerships between the movie "Mommy" and byte jumps is just an inflection point that the industry should take advantage of to make more changes.
天空之城影业曾经出品过《大圣归来》《冈仁波齐》《喜马拉雅天梯》等作品，被认为是电影行业的一匹黑马。
Sky City Pictures, which produced The Return of the Great Sage, Gunn Pozzi and Himalayan Tetsuki, is considered a dark horse in the film industry.
路伟分析，2015年前后，影视行业做了很多线上与线下的融合探索。
Lu Wei analysis, around 2015, the film and television industry has done a lot of online and offline fusion exploration.
但在2017年以后，商业模式上鲜少有创新。
But after 2017, there is little innovation in business models.
正因为缺少创新，面对疫情时，才会显得手足无措。
It is precisely because of the lack of innovation, when faced with the epidemic, will appear helpless.
2020年开年的疫情把影视行业彻底洗牌了，“爱好者大部分离场，剩下的大多都是实干者。
The beginning of the epidemic in 2020 has completely reshuffled the film and television industry, "most fans left the scene, most of the rest are doers."
”从奈飞和迪士尼的发展路径看，未来电影线上化一定会成为趋势。
From the perspective of Nifei and Disney's growth path, film-making in the future is bound to become a trend.
中国目前有40多条院线，1万多家影院，近7万块银幕，影院在重击下也将发生新的整合和商业模式变迁。
With more than 40 theaters, more than 10,000 cinemas and nearly 70,000 screens, cinemas are poised to undergo new consolidation and business model changes.
影视行业为什么会受到如此大的冲击？未来影院会衍生出哪些商业模式？由《囧妈》带来的线上线下融合到底会不会成为趋势？燃财经与路伟进行了一次深度对话。
Why has the film and television industry been hit so hard? What business models will emerge from future cinemas? Will offline convergence brought about by "Jomma" become a trend? There has been an in-depth dialogue between Finance and Lowell.
以下为路伟自述：中国需要奈飞和迪士尼的模型影视行业为什么会受到如此大的考验？近几年中国移动互联网发展速度特别快，但在娱乐产品模型（包括内容和运营模式）上不够创新、脑洞太小。
Here's what Mr. Lu says: Why is China's model movie and television industry in need of Nifei and Disney put to such a test? In recent years, China's mobile internet has grown particularly fast, but it is not innovative enough to model entertainment products, including content and operating models, and has too small a brain hole.
2017年之前，有很多传统与互联网融合的地方。
By 2017, there were many places where tradition had merged with the Internet.
2017年之后，就很少能看到令人兴奋的探索了，尤其在过去两年，娱乐行业非常保守。
After 2017, there will be few exciting explorations, especially in the past two years, when the entertainment industry has been very conservative.
迪士尼和奈飞提供了很好的商业模式样本。
Disney and Nifei offer good examples of business models.
迪士尼去年有7部票房在10亿美金以上的电影，一骑绝尘。
Disney last year had seven films with box office sales of more than $1 billion.
奈飞提高了月费，但用户并没有流失，而且还实现了盈利。
Naifei raised the monthly fee, but the user did not lose money, and achieved a profit.
这说明，现在的消费者，特别是00后、90后，他们已经非常习惯于内容付费，并愿意为自己中意的内容超额付费。
This suggests that consumers, especially after 00 or 90, have become so used to paying for content that they are willing to overpay for their favorite content.
奈飞除了有《爱、死亡和机器人》这种让人眼前一亮的作品，还有马丁·斯科塞斯的《爱尔兰人》，你会发现它不再是一个online（线上）的内容，它的电影产品已经很cinema（影院化）、大屏化，不再是一般意义上的TV内容的online版。
In addition to "Love, Death and Robots," a catchy work, and Martin Scorsese's The Irishman, you'll find that it's no longer a online content, and its movie products are already cinema, screened, and no longer online versions of TV content in general.
中国这两、三年在电影发行和放映革新上进展缓慢，还在继续传统的院线模式。
Over the past two or three years, China has been slow to innovate in film distribution and screening, and is continuing its traditional theatrical model.
图 /Pexels疫情暴露了影视行业的很多问题，线下受到了根本性冲击，线下和线上的融合非常弱。
The picture / Pexels epidemic has exposed many of the problems in the film and television industry, with fundamental offline shocks and very weak offline and online convergence.
这次疫情对内容公司冲击很大，特别是过去10年一直努力做大片、影视工业化的公司。
The epidemic has had a huge impact on content companies, especially those that have been trying to do big, film-and-television industrialization over the past decade.
对于轻装上阵的短视频、网大、短剧的制作方反而利好。
Lightweight on the short video, large screen, short drama producers on the other hand.
但是也有个问题，对于中小内容制作公司，因为资本容量有限，且内容生产模式大多还是传统模型。
But there is also a problem for small and medium-sized content-making companies, since capital capacity is limited and content production patterns are mostly traditional models.
当下，网络内容生产方和院线内容生产方好像并不在一个阵营里对话，各说各的，各做各的。
Right now, it seems that Web content producers and content producers are not talking in the same camp.
网络内容生产方的下游是平台，院线内容生产方的下游是观众。
The downstream of the network content producer is the platform, and the downstream of the content producer is the viewer.
本来网生内容更2C，现在是电影内容最2C，这是一个很奇怪的现象。
Original net student content is more 2C, now is the movie content most 2C, this is a very strange phenomenon.
话说回来，我们关心的不应该是娱乐形式，而应该是娱乐如何服务用户。
That said, our concern should not be with the form of entertainment, but with how it serves its users.
用户需要什么，就应该在合理框架之下做出更多拓展，从业者应该且有必要去关注世界的新变化。
What users need should be expanded within a reasonable framework, and practitioners should and need to pay attention to new changes in the world.
这次疫情对全球的线下娱乐业影响也很大，中国是好莱坞海外市场中最重要的一个，本来2月份要上映很多新片，《007：无暇赴死》、《花木兰》等都延迟了。
The epidemic is also having a big impact on the off-line entertainment industry around the world. China is the most important of Hollywood's overseas markets, with many new films due out in February, such as 007: No Time to Die and Mulan.
北京、上海虽然近期采取了一些对影院的鼓励性政策，但人们对疫情很恐慌，对出门或聚集还是非常抵触。
Although Beijing and Shanghai have recently adopted some encouraging policies for cinemas, people are frightened by the epidemic and are very resistant to going out or gathering.
所以不管政策上怎么支持，线下娱乐很难在短期内恢复正常。
So, no matter how much policy support there is, offline entertainment is unlikely to return to normal anytime soon.
《囧妈》提供了拐点应该趁机“玩下去”《囧妈》选择和今日头条合作，我觉得是非常棒的案例。
"Jomma" provides an inflection point that should be used to "play on." I think it's a great example of how "mom" works with today's headlines.
我在朋友圈说，这部电影有一个特别好的CEO，他在很短时间，反常地通过了一个目前互联网用户普遍都能接受的方式，把电影挪到线上放映了。
I said in a circle of friends that the movie had a particularly good CEO who, in a very short time, uncharacteristically adopted a format that is now generally acceptable to Internet users and moved the film online.
这个案例，我和一些影院的投资人聊过，他们虽然觉得很无奈，但他们也觉得“电影线上上映”是趋势，部分影院投资人已经在投资或正在关注新一代的VR影院。
In this case, I talked to a few movie theater investors, who though they feel very helpless, but they also feel that "film online" is the trend, some cinema investors are already investing in or are watching a new generation of VR theaters.
大约从2014年开始，奈飞和各大电影节矛盾不断，很多人认为奈飞做的不是电影。
Since about 2014, Naifei has been in conflict with major film festivals, and many people don't think he's doing a movie.
欧洲一些传统理念认为电影必须在电影院放映，电影院的场景氛围和集体观影的仪式感很重要。
Some traditional ideas in Europe believe that movies must be shown in cinemas, and that the atmosphere of the cinema and the sense of ritual of group viewing are important.
我们的电影文化中断了很多年，我们对“电影”两个字的理解和欧洲电影人或者一些老电影人的理解不同，我们把能进电影院放映的内容都统称为“电影”。
Our film culture was cut short for many years, and our understanding of the word "film" differed from that of European filmmakers or some older filmmakers.
关于“电影气质”和对“电影感”的理解，我的态度偏保守。
My attitude towards "film temperament" and the understanding of "film sense" is rather conservative.
电影可以持续创新，但“电影感”这个东西不能随便掉价。
Movies can be creative, but the "cinematography" thing can't be dropped.
如今电影变得越来越私人化，特别是VR眼镜（头戴影院）普及以后。
Movies are becoming more and more personal, especially since the popularity of VR glasses (with cinemas on the head).
虽然我每周都去影院看电影，疫情之前一年看几十部，甚至上百部。
Although I go to the cinema every week, I watch dozens or even hundreds of movies a year before the epidemic.
但我用VR眼镜，一年也能看几十、上百部电影。
But with VR glasses, I can see dozens or hundreds of movies a year.
在VR眼镜里看电影是另外一种沉浸，另外一种更主动的体验。
Watching a movie in VR glasses is another kind of immersion, another more active experience.
图 /Pexels对于当下的观众而言，不能说谁好谁坏，你在那个场景里，需要那样的内容，有人提供给你了，这就非常好。
Picture / Pexels For today's audience, it's nice not to say who's good and who's bad, and you need that kind of content in that scene and someone offered it to you.
你会发现，电影观众从原来的被动消费，变得越来越主动。
You'll find that movie audiences are becoming more and more active, away from passive consumption.
另一方面，线下影片的供给量其实很小。
On the other hand, the supply of offline movies is actually small.
每年电影院上映的片子有限，即使一年拍了一千多部，拿到批文能在院线上映的也就四五百部，已经很了不起了。
There are only a limited number of films shown in cinemas each year. Even if more than a thousand films are made a year, four or five hundred of them will be shown in theaters every year.
真正有一定票房和口碑、能被大家看到的也就一两百部。
Really have a certain box office and word-of-mouth, can be seen by everyone on one or two hundred.
线下渠道其实远远不能满足电影观众的观影需求。
In fact, the offline channel is far from satisfying the demand of the movie audience.
不管市场怎么样，我们一定要站在时代发展的角度去看，这是其一。
No matter what the market is, we must stand in the perspective of the development of the times, this is one.
其二，疫情和《囧妈》这个案例一定会让更多人重新思考。
Second, the epidemic and the case of "Jomo" are sure to make more people think again.
2015年是电影院线建设的高潮期，也是电影从制作端、发行端、投资端到观众反馈各方面都呈现积极状态的时期。
The year 2015 is the peak period for film production, distribution, investment and audience feedback.
但是2017年之后，电影行业的精彩案例少了很多，可能是处于调整期。
But after 2017, there are far fewer good examples of the film industry, possibly in a period of adjustment.
从生意角度来看，今日头条这个案例的打法非常高维。
From a business point of view, today's headline story is a very high-dimensional case.
别人用上百亿、几十亿资金才能做到的效果，今日头条在窗口期只用了几个亿。
Other people use billions, billions of dollars to achieve results, today's headlines in the window only a few hundred million.
很多生意，它的爆发期就在某一个时点上，头条抓得非常准。
A lot of business, it erupts at a certain point in time, the headlines are very accurate.
但是如果今日头条和其他视频平台一样，只是为了补充长视频短板，我不觉得商业价值有多大。
But if today's headlines are like any other video platform, just to supplement long video clips, I don't see much commercial value.
如果不是模型方面的创新，只是加了一块拼图，从行业横向来看，没有太多商业想象力。
If not a model of innovation, just add a piece of jigsaw puzzle, from the industry horizontally, there is not much commercial imagination.
市场上不缺、也不会再奖励多一个玩家。
There is no shortage in the market, nor will there be another player.
我最近也在观察微信的视频号，我的看法偏保守。
I've also been watching the video number of the tweets lately, and my opinion is rather conservative.
微信之所以成为大家一直在用的工具，就是因为没有那么多的干扰。
Micromail has always been used because there is not so much interference.
视频非常消耗时间，用户用微信，不是希望微信给他提供越来越丰富的内容。
Video is very time-consuming, users use micromail, not hope to give him more and more rich content.
它的产品价值定位，从开始应该就不是一个内容的聚合平台。
Its product value orientation, from the beginning, should not be a content aggregation platform.
而在影视行业，用户需要的是内容支撑，不是平台支撑，也不是流量支撑。
In the film and television industry, users need to support the content, not the platform support, or flow support.
用户永远不会忠诚于任何一个平台，他们只会忠诚于自己的价值观、世界观。
Users will never be loyal to any platform, they will only be loyal to their own values, world view.
能够承载这些东西的，就是内容本身。
What can support these things is the content itself.
《囧妈》这个案例，有其独特性，也有其偶然性。
The case of "Jomma" has its own peculiarity, as well as its fortuitous nature.
无论对于平台还是内容方，最好的模式应该是保底分账，不是一次性买断。
For both the platform and the content, the best model should be the bottom line, not a one-time buyout.
我不太能接受买断版权的模式，它会让内容团队在创造力方面产生一种惰性。
I'm not comfortable with buyout models, which create a sort of creativity inertia in the content team.
国内的网生内容和奈飞、迪士尼＋相比，还有很大的品质和商业发展空间。
The domestic net student content and the Neifei, Disney + comparison, also has the very big quality and the commercial development space.
再者，中国还没有成熟的版权分享机制。
Moreover, China does not yet have a mature copyright-sharing regime.
总体来说，这次合作算一种尝试，也会让更多人反思，这是好事。
On the whole, this collaboration is an attempt to make more people reflect, and that's a good thing.
市场不能永远停在那，没有动静。
The market can't stop there forever. Nothing happens.
影院不应该放弃建立自己的会员体系从Disney＋的发展脉络看，线上和线下的内容融合、线上放映一定是趋势。
Cinemas should not give up building their own memberships Judging from the development of Disney +, online and offline content fusion, online projection must be a trend.
今天的信息时代已经不是原来的工业时代了，在这个时代再延用旧的规则，很难走向未来。
Today's information age is not the old industrial era, in this era of extension of the old rules, it is difficult to move to the future.
2013年前后，我们在聊中国电影发行市场的未来应该是分线发行，和互联网当时说的分众消费、尊重内容供给有关。
Around 2013, we were talking about the future of China's film distribution market, which should be about offline distribution, about what the Internet was saying about crowd consumption and respecting the supply of content.
但是七、八年过去了，分线发行没有落地。
But seven or eight years later, the sub-line has not landed.
从业者们还是更看重短期商业利益，看重即期利润回报，看重各种数据指标，我们浪费了一次又一次培养用户习惯的机会窗口，很可惜。
Practitioners still value short-term commercial interests, immediate profit returns, and a variety of data indicators. Unfortunately, we waste the window of opportunity that has been used time and time again to cultivate user habits.
有时候，我们不仅要站在眼前看生意，还要站在时间里看模型，到底哪个选择对我们真有价值。
Sometimes, we have to not only stand in front of the business, but also stand in time to see the model, which choice is really valuable to us.
这一点，我还想从另外一个角度讲，互联网帮助了影院，在某些方面也摧毁了一些有价值的东西。
At this point, I would also like to put it another way, the Internet has helped cinemas and in some ways destroyed something valuable.
2015年之前，我有好几家影院的会员卡，每家影院提供的服务都不太一样。
Before 2015, I have membership cards for several cinemas, each offering a different kind of service.
后来，在线票务从根本上摧毁了电影院的会员机制。
Later, online ticketing radically destroyed the cinema's membership mechanism.
影院没有了会员，很难做好精准服务。
Cinema without members, it is difficult to do a good job of precision services.
在线票务是一个巨大的价值转型，但从电影院的精细化运营来讲，实际是把影院的优势放映基础摧毁了。
Online ticketing is a huge value transformation, but from the fine operation of cinemas, is actually destroyed the advantage of cinema screening base.
现在还不晚，影院应该做好自己的会员体系。
It is not too late for cinemas to have their own memberships.
通过会员数据，分析用户类型，提供给他们更优质的产品服务以及差异化的放映品牌，让用户持续消费，这和当下讲的私域流量概念并无差别。
Through member data, analysis of user types, to provide them with better products and services and differentiated brand, so that users continue to consume, this is no different from the current concept of private domain traffic.
将来要做分线发行、分众发行，如果没有对用户数据的精准理解和中长期跟踪，也不可能。
In the future to do sub-distribution, public distribution, if not accurate understanding of user data and long-term tracking, it is impossible.
否则，决策都会变成拍脑袋。
Otherwise, the decision becomes a slap on the head.
前两年市场发展太疯狂，很多做会员体系的影院最后都没了声音。
The first two years of market development is too crazy, many of the member system of cinemas have finally lost their voice.
根本原因在于，大家都觉得在线票务是另外一种更好的模型，在流量致胜的年代，影院无法抗拒。
The bottom line is that everyone thinks online ticketing is a better model, and in an age of traffic success, cinemas can't resist.
但现在流量时代已经日渐成为历史，疫情之后，是不是到了建立更长期的商业生态的时刻，还不好说。
But now that the age of traffic is increasingly history, it is not clear whether the time has come to build a longer-term business ecology after the epidemic.
但不管做生意也好、做产品也好，一定要站在中长期维度去看模式好坏。
But no matter doing business or doing products, we must stand in the medium- and long-term dimension to see the model.
就像好酒一样，需要时间养，需要慢慢尝。
Like good wine, it takes time to nourish and needs to be tasted slowly.
投资也是一样，我特别认同高瓴资本创始人张磊说的。
The same is true of investment, I particularly agree with Zhang Lei, founder of high-altitude capital.
投资首先要看人，然后再看这个人能不能在更长时间维度上做价值创建，最终是不是会落到有时间价值的产品上。
Investment depends first on people and then on whether the person can create value over a longer period of time, and ultimately whether it will end up in time-valuable products.
图 /Pexels过去十多年，影院的发展很顺利，没有特别大的挫折。
Picture / Pexels Cinema has been going well for the past decade or so and there have been no major setbacks.
这次疫情过后，影院在短时期内会发生两方面变化。
After the outbreak, cinemas will change in two ways in a short period of time.
第一，行业复苏可能需要时间，大家都需要耐心。
First, industry recovery may take time and everyone needs to be patient.
有句古话说，“病来如山倒、病去如抽丝。
There is an old saying that "sickness comes down like a hill, sickness like a thread.
”用户很焦虑，如果没有一个能够让大家聚集在一起消费的氛围，影院很难有收入。
Users are anxious that theaters will struggle to make a profit without an atmosphere in which people can congregate to spend.
即使影院开门了，片方也不一定有信心，上映时间可能会推迟。
Even if the cinema opens, the film is not necessarily confident, the opening time may be postponed.
从制片方、出品方到发行方，都还在观望。
From producers to producers to distributors, they are still watching.
第二，现在是影院整合的好时机。
Second, it's a good time for theatrical consolidation.
中国目前有四十多条电影院线，影院的投资机构也是上千家，还有一些管理机构，市场很混乱。
There are now more than 40 movie theaters in China, thousands of investment agencies and a few regulatory agencies, and the market is in turmoil.
至于由谁来整合，谁有资本、谁有眼界，谁就能去整合。
As for who should integrate, who has capital, and who has an eye, who can integrate.
在这里，我要为影院经理说句话。
Here, I'd like to say a word for the theater manager.
片方当然难，影院经理也很难，他们被各方力量裹挟在中间，不自由。
Film side of course difficult, cinema managers are very difficult, they are surrounded by forces in the middle, not free.
他们也希望好片子都可以上线，他们也希望放映机制能够正常往前走，问题不是他们带来的，还是因为行业太混乱了。
They also want good movies to go online, and they want the projection mechanism to go right, not because they brought it in, or because the industry is too messy.
四十几条院线、七万块银幕，其中有各种力量。
Forty dozen lines, seventy thousand screens, among which there are various forces.
过去的二十年，我们的社会过多关注了财富，更多关注了经济本身，而很少关注内心。
Over the past two decades, our societies have focused too much on wealth, more on the economy itself, and less on the heart.
疫情除了带来影院变革也会让爱好者离场电影行业这几年的确进来了不少优秀的人，很多人是奔着个人职业机会或者投资机会去的。
The epidemic will not only revolutionize cinemas, but it will also get fans out of the film industry. In recent years, there have been a number of good people, many of whom are heading for personal career opportunities or investment opportunities.
但是一个行业经过大浪淘沙之后，一定会把实干者留下来，让单纯爱好者离场。
But an industry after the wave after the sand, will definitely leave the doer, let the pure lovers leave the scene.
疫情之后，很多投资人也会离场。
After the outbreak, many investors will leave the scene.
不管投机还是投资，都需要退出时间。
Both speculation and investment require exit time.
而娱乐行业现在的投资退出时间表不是特别明朗。
And the industry's exit schedule is not particularly clear.
尤其近两年，很多激进的心理平静下来，因为很多不可抗力的原因，盘算下来亏损的项目越来越多。
In the past two years in particular, many radical psychology has calmed down as more and more loss-making projects have been calculated for reasons of force majeure.
天灾带来的结果往往是非常系统的，它让很多链条中断。
The consequences of natural disasters are often very systematic, interrupting many chains.
一旦中间传导出了问题，修复起来没那么容易。
Once the conduction goes wrong, it's not that easy to fix.
我们最近启动了一轮百人左右的招聘，是因为我们发现动画制作链条接下来可能会有一些管理性风险。
We recently launched a round of hiring around 100 people because we found that the animation chain might have some managerial risks next.
对于很多制作外包公司、技术公司，如果没有项目，他们就没办法有收入。
For many production outsourcing companies, technology companies, if there are no projects, they will not be able to generate income.
中国的创业公司，能有三个月现金储备的不多。
Chinese startups have little cash reserves for three months.
疫情会让很多公司原本正常的收入变得不确定，这种不确定性会带来团队稳定的风险，也可能会让原本不错的团队突然解散。
The epidemic could leave many companies uncertain about their normal revenues, creating a risk of team stability or a sudden dissolution of otherwise good teams.
这次疫情严重打击的，一定是创始人和投资人，它会让没有耐心的人离开，但同时也是一个规模投资的好时机。
It must be the founders and investors who have been hit hard by the epidemic. It will get impatient people to leave, but it is also a good time to invest in scale.
前几天还有投资圈朋友问我，现在是不是投电影院的好时候，我说肯定是，但是也要考虑市场空间，除非你能拓展出一个新的产品模型出来。
A few days ago my friends in the investment circle asked me if it was a good time to invest in a movie theater. I said yes, but also consider market space unless you can develop a new product model.
图 /视觉中国电影市场太小了，一年700亿的电影放映市场，350亿留给影院，250多亿归了片方。
The Chinese film market is too small, with 70 billion movie shows a year, 35 billion reserved for cinemas, and more than 25 billion going to cinemas.
对于中国上万家影院来说，一共300多亿的流水，对很多投资人来讲生意太小了。
For China's tens of thousands of cinemas, a total of more than 30 billion dollars in water, for many investors business is too small.
所以投资人做的不应仅是电影院的票房生意，而应该是电影院的场景消费。
Therefore, investors should not only do cinema box office business, but should be the scene consumption of the cinema.
人从电影院出来，就应该从观众变为用户。
When people come out of the cinema, they should change from spectators to users.
如何能让观众在进场前10分钟、后10分钟产生其他场景的体验消费特别重要。
How to get the audience to experience other scenes 10 minutes before and 10 minutes after the entry is particularly important.
我经常去三里屯看电影，出了影厅的门就是停车场，根本没有提供映后的消费场景，对于电影衍生场景而言，规划非常不合理。
I often go to Sanlitun to see the film, out of the door is the parking lot, there is no consumption scene after the film, for the film derivative scenario, the planning is very unreasonable.
看艺术片，我喜欢去北京百老汇电影中心，去早了，还可以去书店买本书，看完了，还可以去喝杯咖啡。
I like to go to the Broadway Cinema Center in Beijing, go early, buy a book in a bookstore, watch it, and have a cup of coffee.
其实买书，消费可能比电影票贵得多。
In fact, the purchase of books, consumption than the film ticket may be much more expensive.
所以投资人不要看电影院放映市场的300多亿收入，它的外延可能有1000亿，甚至更高。
So investors don't want to see more than 30 billion dollars in movie theater revenues, which could reach 100 billion dollars or more.
线上也是一样，想扩大市场就要创新，现在的模型创新能力太弱、太保守。
Online, too, wants to expand the market to innovate, the model innovation ability is too weak, too conservative.
内容本身有很强的交易价值，它带来的产品消费力也一点都不弱。
Content itself has a strong trading value, it brings the product consumption is not weak at all.
企业经常是内容本身没做好，商业化也没做好，所以互相怪罪。
Businesses often blame each other for not doing the content themselves and commercializing it.
内容做好了，内容本身就有商业能力。
Once the content is done, the content itself is commercially capable.
有很多时候，一件事情没做好，往往就为它赋予另外的理由解释。
In many cases, when a thing is not done well, it is often given another reason to explain.
譬如我们做艺术电影，很多人会说“你们真有情怀”，其实我做电影最不喜欢的一个词就是“情怀”，我总觉得“情怀”是用来掩盖票房不理想或者商业能力弱的名声遮羞布。
For example, when we make art movies, many people will say, "You really have feelings." In fact, one of my least favorite words for movies is "affections," which I always think are used to mask poor box office performance or poor business acumen.
我选择做什么电影，完全是基于个人志趣爱好，或是对制片人导演的信任，不是出于什么情怀，情怀不是生产力。
What I choose to do is based entirely on personal hobbies or trust in the filmmaker's director, not out of passion, not productivity.
艺术电影的未来是分线发行和艺术空间去年一年，我拒绝了所有的媒体采访，也没有参加任何公开商业活动。
The future of art movies is division distribution and art space. Last year, I refused all media interviews and did not participate in any public commercial activities.
一个是工作很忙，另外也需要一些深入思考。
One is that the work is very busy, but also requires some in-depth thinking.
中国娱乐市场到了一个应该发生转变的时候。
China's entertainment market has reached a point where it should be transformed.
下一阶段，我更愿意把天空之城影业定位成一家电影产品公司，而不仅仅是一家纯粹的内容公司。
In the next phase, I'd prefer to position Sky City as a film production company, not just a pure content company.
产品公司要从世界观和价值观维度与观众达成一致。
The product company should agree with the audience from the world view and the value dimension.
公司要在时间维度上慢慢往前走，生产用户喜欢的内容，而不是把用户热度一下子消费殆尽。
Companies have to move slowly in the time dimension, producing user-friendly content, rather than consuming user enthusiasm all at once.
我希望有一天大家不再像今天一样热衷于票房和各种数据，而是去更多的关心选择给你买单的观众。
I hope one day people will not be as enthusiastic about box office sales and data as they are today, but more concerned about the audience that chooses to pay for you.
作品出来了，他们是不是足够兴奋，足够有满足感，他们会不会沉浸于你的电影，认同你的价值观，是不是愿意和别人分享你的作品，这才是一个长效机制。
When the work comes out, are they excited enough and satisfied enough that they will immerse themselves in your movie, identify with your values, and share your work with others, it's a long-term mechanism.
未来，我们会长期在内容和用户关系上努力，真正建立起“和用户成为朋友”的机制。
In the future, we will long-term efforts in content and user relations, and truly establish "and users become friends" mechanism.
现在，天空之城影业的所有创作模型和设计模型，都在往这个方向走。
Now, all of Sky City's creative models and design models are going in this direction.
我们可能不是一家大的公司，但它一定是有质感的电影公司。
We may not be a big company, but it must be a textured film company.
我特别希望中国影院能有分线发行、分众发行的模型出来。
I particularly hope that Chinese cinemas can have the sub-distribution, the distribution of the model.
艺术电影不应该和商业电影一样，它应该有自己独立的运营空间，可以自成一体，能够支持长期放映。
Art films should not be like commercial movies, they should have their own independent operating space, can be self-contained, can support long-term screening.
虽然现在有些艺术院线也做得不错，但大部分还都是加盟方式，独立运营的不多。
Although some of the art institute line is now doing well, but most are still joining the way, independent operation is not much.
应该有一些资本出来，去做艺术院线以及和电影相匹配的艺术空间。
There should be some capital coming out to do the art line and the art space to match the film.
我特别看好高品质电影和用户之间的长期互动。
I'm particularly optimistic about the long-term interaction between high-quality movies and users.
另外，中国也应该有一些类似法国的艺术电影基金。
In addition, China should have some sort of French art and film fund.
图 /Pexels这次疫情，对于大型商场的消费产品影响很大。
Photo / Pexels This outbreak has had a huge impact on consumer products in large stores.
如果把商场的一个区域或一层楼拿出来，做一些电影空间，我相信它的引流绝对不亚于书店。
If you take a section or floor out of the mall and make some movie space, I'm sure it will be as draining as a bookstore.
大型商场这种公共消费场景，过去影院帮他们解决了人流，解决了顶层无人去的尴尬。
Large shopping malls this public consumption scene, in the past cinemas to help them solve the flow of people, to solve the top level of the embarrassment.
但是艺术电影有中长期效应，我建议各种公共空间，例如联合办公空间、小的产业园区、二次改造的工业区，改造出更多艺术空间。
But art movies have medium- and long-term effects, and I recommend that public spaces, such as co-office space, small industrial parks, reconstructed industrial areas, be transformed into more artistic spaces.
就像798，它是很多人心中的艺术策展圣地，虽然现在已经被各种商业化局限了。
Like 798, it is a mecca of art in many people's minds, although it is now limited by various forms of commercialization.
但是很多人需要这样一个地方，艺术是要告知大家真相的，艺术不是虚拟化。
But a lot of people need a place where art is about telling the truth, and art is not virtualization.
这次疫情让我们看到了恐慌，看到了大家内心的不安。
This outbreak has caused us to see panic, to see the innermost feelings of unease.
不安，其实是价值盲点、心里失衡带来的，它和个人财富、学历无关。
Unrest, in fact, is the value of blind spots, psychological imbalance, it is not related to personal wealth, education.
前段时间那种群体性恐慌，让我一度觉得我们配不上今天拥有的物质条件。
Some time ago that kind of mass panic, let me feel that we do not deserve today's material conditions.
我希望我们的内容能够继承一些东西、拓展一些东西，而不是只是帮观众造了一个梦。
I hope our content inherits something and expands something, not just creates a dream for the audience.
内容本身，特别是电影，很多时候是造梦的机器，但是我希望我们做的电影不仅仅是一个梦，它能让人打开内心，有些不一样的触动。
Content itself, especially movies, is often a dream-making machine, but I hope that the movie we make is more than just a dream. It can open a heart and touch it differently.
