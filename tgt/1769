今天是正月十五，传统上，过了今天 “年” 就过完了。
Today is the fifteenth day of the first month, traditionally, after today's "Year" is over.
而窗外还是一片宁静，我们还不知道疫情什么时候结束，什么时候复工，也还不知道飘散在空气里的那些东西什么时候能够落定。
There was still peace outside, and we had no idea when the outbreak would end, when work would resume, or when the things that were floating in the air would be settled.
过年期间，我们同事的朋友圈里不断传来以一只在家里闷到发慌的老鼠为主角的配文漫画，画面简单生动，细节丰富，文字平实，颇有旧时漫画的风采。
During the Lunar New Year, our colleague's circle of friends to a stuffy mouse as the protagonist of the comics, simple and vivid, rich in details, plain text, quite old manga style.
更重要的是，漫画里流露出乐观的幽默和温暖的生活气息，在这些灰色的日子里，难能可贵地给人带来安慰。
More importantly, the comic strip exudes an optimistic sense of humor and warmth of life, and in these gray days is invaluable as a source of comfort.
漫画的作者是这位朋友的母亲，一位生于 1951 年的北京阿姨，名叫倪小英。
The cartoon is written by the friend's mother, Ni Xiaoying, a Beijing aunt born in 1951.
小英阿姨退休前曾是医院的药剂师，虽从未接受过正规训练，但从小就爱画画。
Before retiring, Aunt Xiaoying was a pharmacist at the hospital. Although she had never been formally trained, she loved to paint since childhood.
小英阿姨这一代人比我们经历过的苦难要多得多，或许那就是这些画面背后那种值得回味的韧劲儿的来源。
Aunt Britain's generation has suffered much more than we have experienced, and that may be the source of the resilience behind these images.
在这样的时刻，这也是我们所需要的。
That is what we need at a time like this.
我们找到小英阿姨，她愿意把漫画分享给更多的人看；我们也通过电话跟她聊了聊这些画背后的想法，以下自述根据电话采访整理而成。
We found Aunt Xiao Ying, and she was willing to share the cartoons with more people. We talked to her over the phone about the ideas behind the paintings.
漫画作者：倪小英漫画作者：倪小英我叫倪小英。
My name is Ni Xiaoying. My name is Ni Xiaoying.
春节儿子在美国，我跟他爸在在北京的家里过年。
The Spring Festival son is in the United States, his father and I spend New Year at home in Beijing.
以往过年，我都会画一幅生肖主题的年画，今年是鼠年，还没到三十，我就先把今年的画给画出来了。
In the past, I would draw a Lunar New Year theme painting, this year is the Year of the Rat, before the 30, I first paint this year's painting.
后来就开始连着画，一天画一幅，把自己的心情表现在里面。
Then began to connect the painting, a day to draw a picture, their mood in the performance.
我的画没什么章法，我也没正规学过画画，就是自己瞎画。
My painting is not organized, I have not formally learned to paint, is their own blind painting.
退休前我在医院工作，上班的时候画得不多，退休之后开始没事儿就画几笔。
Before I retired, I worked in a hospital. I didn't paint much at work. After I retired, I began to draw a few pictures.
我这个人性格比较懒散，高兴了就画两下。
I'm a slacker, so I draw twice when I'm happy.
因为今年过年心情烦闷，需要逗逗乐，这些都通过小老鼠表现出来了，也是一个释放的过程。
Because this year's festive mood, the need to tease tease, these are shown through mice, is also a release process.
我画得挺简单，半小时差不多就画完了，画画的时候那种高兴的心情和小时候没有什么两样，可以说是童心未泯吧。
I have painted it quite simply and finished it in half an hour. The happy mood when I was drawing is just like that in my childhood, which can be said to be childlike.
画完之后，我就分享到朋友圈和一些熟悉的群里，大家都鼓励我每天画，有时候一天没发还有人来问。
After I finished painting, I shared with friends and some familiar groups, everyone encouraged me to paint every day, and sometimes no one came to ask.
这样，大家高兴，我也高兴。
So, everybody's happy, and so am I.
大致每天下午画画，午饭以后就躺着想想，今天要画什么呢？这个想的过程有时候比画画的过程还长，可能突然看到电视上发生了什么，或者想起来什么就成为了灵感。
Paint roughly every afternoon, lie down after lunch and think about what you're going to draw today.The process sometimes takes longer than drawing, and you might suddenly see what's going on on TV, or think about it as inspiration.
比如初八画的那张 “双黄莲蓉月饼”，就是这样。
For example, the "double yellow lotus seed paste moon cake" painted on the eighth day of the year.
漫画作者：倪小英一般都是画一次就成功，和我预期的没什么大的差别。
Comic writer: Ni Xiaoying is usually painted once on the success, and I did not expect a major difference.
就是有时候会写错字，因为我的性格就是这样，马大哈，秉性难移。
Sometimes I write the wrong word, 'cause that's what my personality is, Martha, immutable.
最近每天都通过手机和电视关注疫情的新闻。
News of the epidemic has been followed daily on mobile phones and television.
我以前是药剂师，在医院的药剂科工作，关注这个疫情的心情和一般人肯定不一样。
I used to be a pharmacist, working in the pharmacy department of the hospital, and I'm definitely not in the same mood as most people.
医护人员是最易感的群体，把医务工作者保护好了，才能把百姓保护好。
Medical personnel are the most susceptible group, the health workers to protect the good people.
所以我昨天看到李医生这个事情，心里真的是很难受。
So I saw Dr. Lee yesterday, the heart is really very uncomfortable.
昨天画的小老鼠捧花的这一张，很多人说看了以后哭得不行。
The mouse painted this one yesterday with flowers, and many people said they could not cry after watching it.
虽然画的是一只小老鼠，但是感情还是能表达出来。
Although the painting is a little mouse, but the feelings can be expressed.
但我不喜欢太煽情，而是从平静中感受悲伤，我想我就是这种风格吧，平静，坚韧，理性。
But I do not like to be too emotional, but to feel sadness from the calm, I think I am this style, calm, tenacious, rational.
好多人也跟我说，看我的画看的时候嘻嘻哈哈地笑，看完以后又觉得有点忧伤。
A lot of people also told me to see my picture when laughing, after reading a bit sad.
漫画作者：倪小英漫画作者：倪小英我的父母都在文化系统里工作，我们家五个孩子全都画画，姐姐和小妹妹是专业的美术工作者，剩下的人是业余爱好者。
My parents work in the cultural system. My five children all draw pictures. My sister and younger sister are professional artists, while the rest are amateurs.
所以其实我也熟悉这些东西。
So I'm actually familiar with these things.
我是 51 年生的，小时候最喜欢看小人书，有时候会照着画，但我还是喜欢自己画，随手就来。
I was a 51-year-old. I loved reading books when I was young, and I sometimes follow them, but I still like to paint them myself and come whenever I want.
我喜欢丰子恺，我觉得他的画简简单单，但是回味无穷。
I like Feng Zikai. I think his painting is simple, but it has endless aftertaste.
有人说我画的有丰子恺的风格，我说人家可是大师了，我画的怎么能相提并论呢？但的确是喜欢。
Some people say I paint in Feng Zikai's style, I say they are masters, how can I draw the same? But I do like it.
现在，我平时挺喜欢看那个 “猫大夫” 的漫画，作者是天坛医院的缪医生。
Now, I usually quite like to see that "Doctor Cat" comic book, the writer is Tiantan Hospital's Dr. Mu.
这次我也我很高兴大家能看到我的画。
Me too I'm glad you can see my paintings.
我觉我画的高兴也好，忧伤也好，还是代表了大部分人的心声。
I think I draw happy or sad, or represent the voice of most people.
春节大家都在家闷着，盼望着能早点走出灾难。
People are bored at home during the Spring Festival, looking forward to an early recovery from the disaster.
但也不能光悲伤呀，还要调侃一下，搞笑一下。
But also not just sad ah, but also make fun of it, funny.
希望我画的这些不起眼的画能给大家带来安慰。
I hope these humble paintings will bring us comfort.
