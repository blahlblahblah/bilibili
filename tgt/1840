Liu said that, according to the situation, foreign-funded enterprises that have returned to work have strictly implemented measures to protect their employees from diseases such as body temperature before induction, wearing masks on duty, regular ventilation and disinfection in the workplace, and enhanced food management.
同时，外资企业纷纷结合自身业务特点，采取了居家办公、轮流到岗、网上办公、错峰上下班等灵活方式，减少员工聚集，降低感染风险。
At the same time, foreign-funded enterprises have adopted flexible methods such as telecommuting, rotating between jobs, working on the Internet and commuting to and from work, in order to reduce the concentration of employees and reduce the risk of infection.

Due to the impact of the epidemic, about 6 of the 78 consular offices in Shanghai have suspended their visa operations, some have adjusted their arrangements for handling visa transactions, and 19 have not yet started their work properly.
对此，上海市外办主任张小松表示，外事部门高度关注，每天也都在跟领事机构沟通，确保大家可以及时办理签证。
Zhang Xiaosong, director of Shanghai's foreign affairs department, said the foreign affairs department was highly concerned and was communicating with consular authorities every day to ensure that visas could be processed in a timely manner.
此前上海为支持企业抗疫情保发展出台了“沪28条”政策，一些在沪外资企业对政策中有关金融信贷的内容非常关注。
Shanghai has previously issued the "Shanghai 28 Regulations" policy to support enterprises in fighting the epidemic, and some foreign-funded enterprises in Shanghai are very concerned about the contents of financial credit in the policy.
对此，刘敏表示，上海市商务委了解到外资企业的融资需求，已向有关部门推荐了百余家外资企业名单，积极推动落实这项政策尽快落地，“目前已落实外资企业融资需求超过了123亿”。
In response, Liu said the Shanghai Commerce Commission, aware of the financing needs of foreign-funded enterprises, had recommended to the relevant authorities a list of more than 100 foreign-funded enterprises and actively promoted the implementation of this policy.
