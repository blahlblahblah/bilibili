口述 马洪全采写谢如颖图片 陈玮曦马洪全今年 27 岁，在武汉生活了 3 年多，本职工作是一名金融销售。
Weixi Ma Hongquan, 27, has lived in Wuhan for more than three years and is a financial salesman.
2 月 9 日，武汉某医院招募志愿者，负责病房消毒和清理医疗垃圾。
February 9, Wuhan, a hospital recruitment volunteers, in charge of the hospital room disinfection and cleaning up medical waste.
这大概是此次疫情中非医护人员所能从事的最危险的工作。
This is probably the most dangerous job that non-medical workers in the epidemic can do.
思考了一晚上，马洪全做好了最坏的打算，3 天后正式上岗。
After thinking all night, Ma Hongquan prepared for the worst and took up his duties three days later.
他说，只要身体条件允许，他会做到疫情结束的那一天。
He said he would be able to reach the end of the epidemic as long as physical conditions allowed.
以下是马洪全的自述：( 一 )2 月 9 号，我在微信群里看到消息，武汉某医院将紧急收治 800 个新冠病人，急需志愿者，负责病房内消毒和医疗废物的收集。
On Feb. 9, I read in a microphone group that a Wuhan hospital would treat 800 newly-weaned patients in urgent need of volunteers to disinfect the wards and collect medical waste.
新冠病毒主要通过飞沫、接触和有限气溶胶传播，到污染区和病毒零距离接触，稍有不慎，有极大的风险被感染。
The new crown virus is mainly transmitted by droplets, contact and finite aerosols, to the contaminated area and zero contact with the virus, slightly careless, there is a great risk of infection.
我有些挣扎，想了很久，洗澡时在想，躺在床上也在想。
I struggled and thought for a long time, thinking while I was taking a bath and lying in bed thinking.
最后得出的结论是没关系，我还年轻，万一被感染了这个后果还可以接受。
The bottom line is that it doesn't matter. I'm young, and the consequences are acceptable in the event of infection.
我不想站在岸上（旁观），我一直想做这样的事情。
I don't want to stand on the bank. I've always wanted to do this.
但是你说年轻人怕不怕人没了呢？也怕也不怕。
But you say young people are not afraid of people? I am afraid.
怕的是我还有很多事没做，还有父母、爱人。
Fear is that I still have a lot of things to do, parents, lovers.
不怕的话，怎么说呢，年轻人都有一份激情，有一个生活态度或者怎么样。
Young people have a passion, a life attitude or something, anyway.
报了名，11 号培训，12 号正式上岗。
Nominated, training number 11, official onboarding number 12.
我负责医院一层楼 18 个病房的保洁，一个病房三张床，54 个病人。
I was in charge of cleaning 18 wards on the first floor of the hospital, three beds in one ward and 54 patients.
每早 8 点，手消毒后进入更衣室，换上干净的病号服，到清洁区后有 12 个步骤，做全身防护和消毒，两层头套、两层手套鞋套，还有防护面屏，每个步骤之间都需要拿酒精不断消毒。
Every 8: 00 a.m., hand disinfection into the dressing room, change into a clean patient's clothes, to the clean area after 12 steps, do full-body protection and disinfection, two-layer hood, two gloves shoes cover, and the screen, each step requires constant alcohol disinfection.
再依次进入三个缓冲间，之后到半污染区，这是医护人员离开时脱防护服的地方。
Then go into the three buffer zones and then into the semi-polluted area, where the paramedics leave the protective clothing.
收好这里的医疗废物，再进入污染区，也就是病房。
Keep the medical waste here and go back to the contaminated area, the wards.
进到污染区，第一件事是配 84 消毒水，把 20 来个拖把头和 50 多个消毒小方巾浸泡 20 到 30 分钟。
When entering the contaminated area, the first thing is to mix 84 disinfectant water and soak 20 mop heads and more than 50 sterile towels for 20 to 30 minutes.
为了防止交叉感染，每间病房一个拖把头，每个病床一个消毒小方巾，不能混用。
In order to prevent cross-infection, each ward a mop head, each bed a small sterile square scarf, can not be mixed.
然后一间一间病房收集垃圾，卫生间的、房间的，封好再消毒。
Then one room at a time collects rubbish, bathroom's, room's, seals up again disinfection.
上下午各清理一遍，下午 5 点下班，每天如此往复。
Clean up in the morning and afternoon, close at 5 pm, and go back and forth every day.
最近医院的发热门诊缺清洁员，我就报名了，每天夜里 12 点到 2 点，偶尔医疗垃圾转运缺人手，我也会帮下忙加个班。
I signed up for the recent fever clinic at the hospital. Every night from 12: 00 to 2: 00 p. m., I'd also help out with the occasional medical waste transfer.
这些医疗和生活垃圾的感染性极强。
These medical and domestic wastes are highly infectious.
像是药品盒、输液针管、盒饭的飞沫，还有卫生间废物，输液器万一刺破了皮肤那是百分之百感染。
Like medicine boxes, syringes, boxed rice droplets, and toilet waste, if the transfusion were to pierce the skin that would be 100% infected.
新冠的典型症状包括呕吐和腹泻。
Typical symptoms of the new crown include vomiting and diarrhea.
有些病人来不及去卫生间，随地呕吐，或是排泄了出来。
Some patients have no time to go to the bathroom, vomit, or excreted.
清理起来也很危险，首先你要消毒，用消毒抹布把它盖住，一个盖不了盖两个，两个盖不了盖三个，然后往上喷消毒物。
It's dangerous to clean it up. First you disinfect it, cover it with a disinfectant cloth, one won't cover two, two won't cover three, and then spray it up with disinfectant.
消毒也需要一定的时间，等十分钟后消得差不多了，再清洁打扫，然后装到医疗垃圾袋，密封包装，放到回收的地方。
It also takes time to disinfect, wait about ten minutes, then clean and clean, then pack it in a medical dustbin, seal it, and put it in a recycle bin.
再回去将原地消毒，再把清扫用具密封包装、放到回收处。
Then go back in place disinfect, and then the cleaning utensils sealed packaging, put in the recycling area.
这个过程每时每刻都很危险。
The process is dangerous at all times.
清洁和消毒要求高，我的工作量大到停不下来，也不敢停下来，因为运动量大，穿在里面的衣服，包括内衣内裤全部汗湿，你站在那里不动或是稍微停顿一下，全身都会冷飕飕的，受不了。
The demands of cleaning and disinfection are so great that I cannot stop or stop my work because of the amount of exercise, the sweaty clothes on it, including my underwear, and you stand still or pause for a while, chilly and unbearable.
你只能不停的干活。
You just have to keep working.
而且你干得越久，防护服的防护力也会下降，有时动作幅度过大，就可能会把防护服弄破，口罩有可能脱落。
Also, the longer you work, the less protective clothing you'll have, and sometimes you'll break your suit and lose your mask if you move too far.
所以你只能逼着自己以最快时间完成。
So you have to push yourself to finish as fast as you can.
有些垃圾必须要用手清理或是接触的话，那就得在原来的防护基础上再戴一层手套，处理完之后赶紧把那个手套取掉，密封包装，放到该放的位置。
If some of the rubbish must be cleaned or touched by hand, an additional layer of gloves should be worn on top of the original protection, and then the gloves should be removed, sealed and placed where they should be.
那时你根本无暇顾及可能被感染的压力，你如果不及时清理的话，传播和污染范围更大，潜在伤害的是所有人。
There is no time to worry about the stress of possible infection, and if you don't clean it up in time, the spread and contamination will be greater, potentially harming everyone.
( 二 )病房里的患者都非常配合，不断地和我说谢谢、麻烦，弄脏了病房或是卫生间，他们会觉得非常不好意思。
(2) The patients in the ward are very cooperative and feel very embarrassed when they keep telling me thank you, trouble, mess up the ward or the bathroom.
有时同病房的老人行动不方便，他们会帮忙擦床、收拾盒饭，还会活跃气氛，讨论下电视剧情、家庭关系。
Sometimes inconvenient with the elderly in the ward, they will help clean the bed, packed meals, but also lively atmosphere, discuss TV drama, family relations.
之前他们可能病得比较严重，打不上针，排队 10 个小时才能打上一针，第二天又排上 10 个小时打上一针，现在进了医院心态也慢慢稳定下来了。
They may have been seriously ill, unable to get a shot, queued for 10 hours to get an injection, then lined up for another 10 hours the next day, and are slowly settling down in the hospital.
虽然我不懂疾病的具体情况，但是我能感受到各方面都在变好。
Although I don't know the exact circumstances of the disease, I can feel that everything is changing for the better.
病友之间经常讨论病情，也相互打气。
Patients often discuss their illness and cheer each other up.
有个阿姨提到自己一直无法就医，情绪有些激动。
An aunt mentioned that she had been unable to see a doctor and was emotionally agitated.
之前她发烧比较重，找到社区，社区说没办法，医院没有床位，之后社区每天打电话，问她情况怎么样，她会说我今天体温多少多少。
Before she had a fever, found the community, the community said there was no bed, then the community called every day to ask her how she was, and she would say how much I had today.
工作人员说，这还算好，蛮正常的，因为没继续烧。
Staff said it was fine and normal because it didn't go on burning.
她说是啊，我吃了退烧药，但是我症状确实不是蛮好，而且持续了很多天了。
She said yes, I took the antipyretic, but my symptoms weren't really good, and they lasted a lot of days.
她一直想去做检测，拖了很久之后，医院说你这个还真的蛮严重的。
She was trying to get a test, and after a long delay, the hospital said you were really serious.
她就说是啊，我是很严重，一直跟你们说，你们一直说没办法。
She said yes, I am very serious, have been telling you, you always said no way.
她讲的时候我不会多回应，只是做个倾听者，尽可能不去触动病人情绪。
I don't respond much when she talks, but I try to be a listener and try not to upset the patient.
五病房的 14、15 床前几天出院，每次我一去，他都在喊，「哎呀，小伙子，盼星星盼月亮把你盼来了，帮我们调个台，我想看非城勿扰。
I left the hospital a few days before bed in Ward 5, and every time I went out, he kept yelling, "Hey, lad, I'm looking forward to the moon waiting for you, help us set the stage, I want to see you don't disturb.
」他们出院的时候，我蛮开心的，觉得自己的工作有意义。
"When they were discharged from the hospital, I had a good time and felt that my work was meaningful.
这个时期信心比什么都重要，病友知道有人出院了，都很开心。
Confidence is more important than anything at this time. Patients are happy to know that someone has been discharged from the hospital.
那天我在拖地，有一个病人跟着电视唱起歌了。
I was mopping the floor the other day when a patient sang along with the TV.
武汉前几天下雪，他们打电话回家，说雪好大。
Wuhan a few days ago snow, they called home, said how big snow.
在病房待久了，个别的老爷爷坐不住，经常去走廊闲逛、晒太阳，拿衣服出来晒。
Stay in the ward for a long time, individual grandpa can not sit down, often to stroll in the corridor, bask in the sun, take clothes out to bask in.
每次他一出来，医护人员都搀他回去，劝他走廊里的病菌更多。
Every time he came out, the paramedics took him back and advised him to have more germs in the hallway.
他不太听得进去，喊着要回家，我家住在哪里，要给孩子打电话，觉得我为什么要在这里。
He couldn't hear enough to go in, yelling to go home, where my family lived, to call the kids, why I was here.
这时沟通比较难，需要去引导他。
At this time communication is more difficult, need to guide him.
今天我去他病房，发现早餐也没吃，桌上盒饭是昨晚的，他一直在念叨，前几天能上能下，这几天睡得多了，觉得好像有谁慢待他了，让他成了现在这样。
Today, I went to his room and found that I didn't eat breakfast. The box on the table was last night. He kept saying, "I can go to bed the other day.
我赶忙和他说，有些治疗手段或是药物可能导致睡眠多，你不要担心，先把饭吃了。
I hastened to tell him that some treatments or medications might lead to more sleep. Don't worry, eat your meal first.
他稍微缓和点，但还是一直在碎碎念。
He eased up a little, but he kept breaking things up.
我一边收拾，把床摇起来，问他「这个高度可以了吗？」其实你不用和他拉锯战，感受到心意，就不会太抵抗。
As I straightened up, I shook up the bed and asked him, "Is that all right?" You don't have to fight him, you feel like you're not going to resist much.
有一天，有个老奶奶明显情绪低落，一直沉默，我也没敢多问。
One day there was an old woman who was visibly depressed and silent, and I dared not ask.
护士进来上心电监护仪，她不太同意，再进来问，老奶奶说「等下吧，让我休息一下。
The nurse came in on the ECG monitor. She didn't agree. She came in and asked, "Wait, let me have a rest.
」我告诉护士，老奶奶比较悲观。
"I told the nurse that the old woman was pessimistic.
护士说，她老伴昨天去世了。
The nurse said her old wife died yesterday.
医护人员其实比我们辛苦得多。
The paramedics work much harder than we do.
我们费体力，他们身心俱疲。
We expend our physical and mental strength.
长时间穿着防护服，他们的鼻腔都是 84 消毒水的味道，脱了防护服可能还是很眩晕，根本吃不下饭。
Wear protective clothing for a long time, their nasal cavity is 84 disinfectant smell, take off the protective clothing may still be very dizzy, can not eat rice.
( 三)这份志愿者工作之前，我在武汉一个隔离点做安保志愿者。
(iii) Prior to the volunteer's work, I worked as a security volunteer at an isolated point in Wuhan.
那会儿隔离点刚设立，各种设施改造都很匆忙，匆忙归匆忙，病人已经入住了。
By that time the quarantine had just been set up, the facilities had been overhauled in a hurry, and the patients had moved in.
我们几乎什么都做，消杀、保洁、安保全都负责。
We do almost everything, killing, cleaning, and security.
人员招募也很匆忙，我们一天工作 12 个小时，两班倒，有时一个人，有时两三个人一起，负责 45 个疑似病患。
There was also a rush to recruit people. We worked 12 hours a day in two shifts, sometimes one person, sometimes two or three people, in charge of 45 suspected patients.
说是疑似，其实大部分都只是因为没法检测而无法确诊，当时隔离点也没有任何治疗措施。
Said to be suspected, in fact, most are simply not able to detect because of the inability to diagnose, the isolation point at the time there was no treatment.
有的志愿者做了一两天，觉得接受不了，或者身体受不了，就离开了。
Some volunteers did it for a day or two and felt unable to accept it or could not stand it, so they left.
后期病人越来越多，事就更多了。
As the number of patients increases, so does the number of events.
早上起来，要给每个房间发早餐，吃完了，再挨个放开水瓶在门口，之后再把早饭垃圾收走。
Wake up in the morning and serve breakfast in each room. When you finish eating, leave the water bottle at the door one by one, and then take away the breakfast trash.
当时你还没吃早餐，就有四五十个开水瓶和垃圾要收拾，完了又要测体温，测完又要送午饭。
Before you had breakfast, there were forty or fifty cans of water and rubbish to be packed up. Then you had to take your temperature and lunch after the test.
之后又是一个循环，又要送晚饭、送中药、测体温了。
Then there is a cycle, and to send dinner, Chinese medicine, temperature testing.
那是我第一次密切接触患者，说不恐惧是假的。
It was the first time I had close contact with a patient and said no fear was false.
每次进患者房间时，我会吸一口气再进，进去有一种窒息感。
Every time I go into the patient's room, I take a breath and go in, there is a sense of suffocation.
房间时时刻刻关着门，我们尽量劝患者打开窗户，不通风的话，病菌含量也会增高。
The door is always closed. We try to persuade the patient to open the window. If it is not ventilated, the germ content will increase.
那时候不管进房间，还是进卫生间，都有一股窒息感。
There was a sense of suffocation in the room and in the bathroom.
穿着防护服，汗不断往下流，各种闷热，但事情还要做。
Wear protective clothing, sweat constantly flow down, all kinds of sultry, but things have to do.
有一次一位老人内急，他岁数比较大，体力不行，还戴着氧袋，我扶他去洗手间。
Once an old man was in a hurry. He was older, physically unfit and wore an oxygen bag. I helped him to the bathroom.
到了那边他走不动了，一直往下坠，我一个人扶不住，赶紧叫人，两个人也扶不住，眼看不行了，赶紧拉个椅子过来，还是扶不起来，两个人根本架不起来。
When he got there, he could no longer walk, he went down, I could not hold him alone, I had to send for someone, and they could not help each other. They could not help each other.
医生过来之后先让他躺着，把头垫着，赶紧叫 120。
The doctor came and told him to lie down, put his head on his back and called 120.
他的妻子女儿也在那个隔离点，儿子症状比较轻在家隔离。
His wife and daughter were also at the quarantine site, and his son's symptoms were mild and isolated at home.
他的女儿陪他上了 120，当晚他的女儿回来，重新办理入住。
His daughter accompanied him to 120, that night his daughter came back, re-check in.
我问她老人情况怎么样，她说那天在 120 车上老人就去世了。
I asked her how the old man was, and she said he had died that day in the 120-car car.
她讲得很平静，我们理解她的心情。
She spoke quietly, and we understood her feelings.
老人在这里症状突然加重，我有些愧疚，说不上来，很复杂。
Here the symptoms of the elderly suddenly increased, I feel a little guilty, can not say, very complex.
最后她请我先不要把噩耗告诉她母亲。
Finally she asked me not to tell her mother the bad news.
( 四 )我是湖北襄阳人，2015 年家人病重，我从深圳搬到武汉。
I am from Xiangyang, Hubei Province. My family was seriously ill in 2015. I moved from Shenzhen to Wuhan.
三年多来，我从健身销售做到了金融销售，目前还在上电大。
For more than three years, I have achieved financial sales from fitness sales, and I am still on TV University.
我非常喜欢武汉，不管你挣多少钱，在这里生活水平都挺好的。
I like Wuhan very much, no matter how much money you earn, the living standard here is quite good.
这里也有我的女朋友，有她在的地方就很安逸。
There are my girlfriends, too. It's easy to be where she is.
1 月 23 号封城之前，武汉一直是正常活动的，我们都不太清楚到底发生了什么。
Until the city was closed on January 23, Wuhan had been functioning normally, and we were not sure what had happened.
当时很多人过年回家了，我没回家，兼职做了地铁安检员，即使 23 号政府下达指令，必须戴口罩才能坐地铁，但还是有很多人没戴。
Many people returned home after the Lunar New Year. I didn't go home. I worked part-time as a subway examiner.
后面更多消息传来，才意识到疫情已经到一定地步了。
More news later came to light that the outbreak had reached a certain point.
武汉市民全都慌了，我也慌。
Wuhan city people all panicked, I also panic.
我家楼下的超市人山人海，方便面、面条全没了。
The supermarket below my home is crowded with people, instant noodles, noodles are gone.
各项措施没来得及做，缺各种物资，出行指南都没有。
Measures do not have time to do, lack of materials, travel guides are not available.
那两天真的是很乱。
Those two days were really messy.
我家在香港路上，家楼下就是一家医院，发热门诊挨着街道，从窗户往下看，人已经排到了街上。
My home is on Hong Kong Road, a hospital downstairs, the fever clinic next to the street, looking down the window, people have been lined up in the street.
这次疫情，无论你是富人还是中产，不管是公众人物或是政府官员，都特别平等，因为无一幸免。
This epidemic, whether you are rich or middle class, public figures or government officials, is particularly equal, because no one is immune.
武汉封城阻止了传播吗？没有。
Does Wuhan block the spread of the city? No.
它只是阻止了向全国和全世界传播，它在病人的家里传播。
It only prevented its spread nationally and worldwide, and it spread in the homes of patients.
这个疫情起源于武汉，各种机制没有到位，我们武汉人做得不对，武汉人没有重视，我们自己承担了后果，极其惨烈，医疗系统不堪重负都是武汉确确实实发生的事情。
This outbreak originated in Wuhan, various mechanisms are not in place, we Wuhan people do not do right, Wuhan people do not pay attention to, we ourselves bear the consequences, extremely tragic, the medical system overburdened is Wuhan is the real thing.
有时候想到这些，都不想去看新闻，要么就去跟亲人视频聊天，或者玩一下手机、打打游戏，甚至就是发呆，发完呆你发现四点了，再发完呆六点了，有用吗？你能麻痹自己吗？每天无数次这样循环。
Sometimes think of this, do not want to go to see the news, or to chat with relatives video, or play mobile phones, games, or even a daze, you found that four o'clock, the end of a stay of six, useful? Can you paralyze yourself? Countless times a day such cycles.
怎么办？只能每个人自救，任何人都不能置身事外，所有人才能得救。
What? Only everyone can help themselves, no one can stay out of the way, all can be saved.
每个武汉人都在努力，默默无闻努力的人太多了，我做的微不足道。
Wuhan people are trying hard, silent effort too many people, I do not do anything.
做了志愿者之后，害怕交叉感染，我住进了医院安排的宿舍。
Being a volunteer, afraid of cross-infection, I was admitted to a hostel arranged by the hospital.
家里的猫只能找人帮忙上门喂养。
Cats in the house have to be fed door-to-door.
前阵子武汉封了小区，我只好发到社区群里，有个女孩子看到了，转天去了我家帮忙，添粮加水，还帮忙打扫了卫生。
Some time ago, Wuhan sealed the community, I had to send to the community, a girl to see, the next day to my home to help, food and water, but also to help clean up the sanitation.
现在出门都是一件需要勇气的事情。
It takes courage to go out now.
我非常感谢她，给她发了红包，她没收，说自己是武汉人，对我的工作表达谢意。
I thanked her very much and gave her a red envelope. She confiscated it and said she was from Wuhan and thanked me for my work.
我没有和家人说具体的工作内容，他们只知道我在做志愿者。
I didn't tell my family what I was doing. They just knew I was volunteering.
我会给他们看一些医院的情况，虽然不在我身边，但是你讲给他们听，他能感同身受，能知道，知道了就会理解。
I'll show them some hospitals, not by my side, but if you tell them, he can empathize, know, understand.
18 号医院给所有志愿者安排了 CT 和核酸的检测，转天结果全部是阴性，我松了口气，发了个朋友圈晒了下结果，说「可以继续安心战斗了」。
Hospital 18 arranged CT and nucleic acid testing for all the volunteers, the next day all negative results, I relaxed, issued a circle of friends bask in the results, said "can continue to fight confidently."
只要身体条件允许，我会战斗到疫情结束那一天。
As long as my health permits, I will fight until the end of the epidemic.
C O N T R I B U T O R S责编：Neil执行：本本闭关期间，我修炼成十级清洁家电买手有人替我们读懂了清洁家电那些参数，拿去抄湖北救援行动中的这支队伍，是被「骂」出来的不可思议的行动力，来自她们的「绝对准则」。
