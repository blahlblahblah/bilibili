The Hanks' diagnosis has come under scrutiny not only because they are celebrities, but also because they pose a greater risk of disease control than the average patient, Tom Hanks. Cheryl Hanks, a reporter for Caijing, posted on social media on the morning of March 12 announcing that both she and his wife, Rita Wilson, had been diagnosed with pneumonia.
他们是在澳大利亚昆士兰州的黄金海岸确诊的，现已被送往当地的一家医院诊治。
They were diagnosed on the Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia, and were taken to a local hospital for treatment.
