It was not until the afternoon of February 24, when the community grid worker and the building director entered the house to check on the outbreak.
生前，谭民华是湖北十堰东风集团铸造一厂的退休职工，与孙子亮亮共同居住在张湾区花果街道办铸一社区，儿子和儿媳远在广西柳州打工。

Living in the Li Lan's home these two days, she found bright bright "depressing."
“他估计还没明白发生了什么事。
"He doesn't think he knows what's going on yet.
”李兰说。
"said Li Lan.
26日下午，铸造一厂工会一工作人员称，目前，谭民华的尸体已经火化。
On the afternoon of May 26, a worker at a foundry union said Tan's body had been cremated.
因2月3日起十堰城区和各县市区城关地区禁止车辆通行，26日中午，工厂同事、社区工作人员协同警方一起出发，由警车把亮亮送至陕西安康。
Since February 3 Shiyan City and the county-level urban areas closed to vehicular traffic, 26 noon, factory colleagues, community workers together with the police set out, bright lights sent to Shaanxi Ankang.
亮亮的父母也从柳州出发前往安康，汇合后，他们将把孩子带往柳州。
Bright parents also set out from Liuzhou for Ankang, where they will take their children to Liuzhou.
2月24日下午，亮亮被社区工作人员接走照料“他还没明白发生了什么事”一份落款为花果街道办事处的《关于谭民华死亡情况的报告》提到，谭民华现年71岁，与孙子共同居住在花果街道办铸一新村小区36栋10单元502室。

To this end, the North Qingsheng reporters repeatedly contact the street office and Cast a community, the other side said "propaganda department response based."
对于网传谭民华“死了三天左右”，郭瑞兵在接受红星新闻采访时曾称，“这是不可能的，张湾区实行战时管制，社区内网格员每天上门排查居民身体状况，量体温，这位老人还患有长年的基础性疾病，这些在街道办都有记录。
"This is out of the question," Guo said in an interview with the Red Star News. "Zhang Wan is under wartime control and community grid workers conduct daily house searches to check residents' physical condition and take temperature.

"As for the bright future, Guo said he would follow the normal procedures, first to check physical fitness and second, the streets to take care of the children's daily lives.
社区志愿者李兰也是东风铸造一厂的退休职工，她的家与谭家仅隔着一条马路。
Li Lan, a community volunteer, is also a retired worker in Dongfeng foundry, whose home is only a block away from Tan's family.
得知消息后，李兰主动找到社区，想将亮亮带回家中暂时照顾，“孩子小的时候我经常见到他，很可爱的，这种时期真是不容易”。
After learning the news, Li Lan took the initiative to find the community, want to bring the bright light back home to temporarily take care of, "I often saw him when the child was young, very lovely, this period is not easy."
经社区医生初步检查，孩子身体状况良好。

Li Lan said the children's parents were working in Guangxi, and his grandfather lived at home with a bright light.

暂住于志愿者家中的亮亮“我挺好的，还得把孩子带大呢”谭民华居住的56栋楼下有个社区诊所，工作人员平时义务为65岁以上老人测量血压、血糖，并定期随访。
"I'm fine and need to raise my kids," Tam said of a community clinic downstairs where staff routinely measure blood pressure, blood sugar and follow-up visits for people over the age of 65.
诊所工作人员王琳称，谭民华血糖偏高，患有糖尿病。
Clinic staff Wang Lin said Tan Min-hua has high blood sugar and diabetes.
2019年的一天，她看见谭民华从幼儿园接孙子放学回来，便喊住他，让老人检查下身体。
One day in 2019, she saw Tan Minhua pick up her grandson from kindergarten after school, so she stopped him and asked the old man to check on him.
在王琳看来，那时的谭民华声音洪亮，看起来身体很硬朗，精神状态也不错。
In Wang Lin's eyes, Tan Min-hua at that time sound loud, looks very strong, mental state is also good.
不过，她还是提醒他注意锻炼身体，饮食也要注意，按时吃药。
Still, she reminded him to exercise, to watch his diet and to take medicine on time.
王琳当时问他，每天走路不走？他说，接孩子不就是走路吗？问他最近吃药没？他说，吃了。
Wang Lin then asked him if he walked every day. "Isn't it walking to pick up a child?" he said. "Did he take any medicine recently?" he said.
再问吃了啥药？谭民华就不说话了。
Then asked what kind of medicine to take? Tan Min Hua stopped talking.
“不知道他到底吃没吃，他觉得自己挺健康的，不是很上心。
"I don't know if he's eating or not, he thinks he's healthy and not very centered.
我有时候还说他，叔叔你要注意身体，家里还有个小孩儿，要好好的哈。
I sometimes say he, uncle You have to pay attention to the body, there is a child at home, to good ha.
他说没事，我挺好的，还得把孩子带大呢。
He said it's okay. I'm fine. I have to bring up the baby.
”王琳称，去年2月前后，谭民华瘫痪在床的妻子去世了，此后他独自带孙子生活，平时也很少看到谭家有亲戚来串门。
Wang said Tan's wife, who was paralyzed in bed, died about February last year and has been living alone with his grandchildren.
2018年底，王琳曾和同事一起上门为谭民华的妻子检查身体，他的妻子也患有高血压、糖尿病。
At the end of 2018, Ms. Wang and her colleagues visited Tan's wife, who also suffers from high blood pressure and diabetes.
一进门，她就闻到家中有异味儿，屋子里很乱，衣服堆在地上。
As soon as she entered, she smelled something strange in the house. It was a mess and her clothes were piled on the floor.
“儿子儿媳出去打工了，两个老人带小孙子生活不容易，也能理解。
"My son and daughter-in-law are out working, and it's not easy and understandable for the two old men with their little grandson.
”之后，王琳曾打电话叫谭民华到诊所复诊，谭民华说来不了，老伴住院了要照顾。
"Later, Wang called Tan Min-hua to the clinic for revisits. Tan Min-hua couldn't say that her wife was hospitalized to take care of her.
谭家住五楼，谭民华曾和王琳感叹，年纪大了跑上跑下真不方便，以后想租个在一楼的房子。
Tan Jiabao fifth floor, Tan Min-hua and Wang Lin lamented that the elderly run up and down really inconvenient, would like to rent a house on the first floor.
听到老人离世的消息，王琳很震惊，“不确定死亡原因，我也是事发后才听说他有冠心病”。
Wang Lin was shocked to hear of the old man's death. "I wasn't sure of the cause of death until I heard he had coronary heart disease."

On the afternoon of May 26, a worker at a foundry union said Tan's body had been cremated.
“老人家在职时工作勤勉，为人质朴、善良”，这名工作人员说。
"The old people are diligent, simple and kind at work," the staff said.
因2月3日起十堰城区和各县市区城关地区禁止车辆通行，26日中午，工厂同事、社区工作人员协同警方一起出发，由警车把亮亮送至陕西安康。
