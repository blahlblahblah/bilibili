环游中国341天后，这位湖北骑士被定格在了家乡外。

在18世纪的传说中，“飞翔的荷兰人”是一艘注定永远漂泊、无法返乡的幽灵船。
In the legend of the 18th century, the "flying Dutchman" is destined to drift forever, unable to return home.
在过去一年里，灰兔成了一名“飞翔的湖北人”，骑行经过了近乎全中国。
In the past year, the rabbit became a "flying Hubei people," riding almost all over China.
可他虽然围着中国转了一大圈，却绕开了湖北，没有再回去。
But although he made a great circle around China, he circumvented Hubei and did not go back.

本文为今日头条“编舟计划”系列文章第15篇。
This article is for today's headline "Boating Plan" series article 15.
编舟计划，记录游戏与时代，只收集与游戏相关最优秀的文章。
Boating plans, recording games with the times, collect only the best articles related to the game.

.
大年初二，灰兔发了一条微博：“操，怎么就成终末旅行了？”。
New Year's Day, the gray rabbit hair a micro-blog: "Fuck, how come the end of the trip?"
那是武汉封城后的第三天，也是灰兔流浪在外的第365天，全国对于疫情的应对都在收紧，他突然发现大街上变得几乎空无一人。
It was the third day after the city was closed in Wuhan and 365 days after the Grey Rabbit had wandered away. As the nation's response to the epidemic tightened, he suddenly found the street almost empty.
。
.
去年元宵节，他捐掉了自己所有的钱，骑着自行车带着帐篷从上海出发，在一年的时间里几乎环游了中国。
On the Lantern Festival last year, he donated all his money and set out from Shanghai on a bicycle with a tent. He almost traveled around China in a year.
。
.
就在他准备为这段旅程画上一个句号时，世界给了他一个欧·亨利式的结尾——其中一部分，是因为他是湖北人。
Just as he was about to finish the journey, the world gave him an O'Henry-style finale - part of it because he was a Hubei.
随着新冠病毒疫情的逐渐扩散，他慢慢失去了获得补给的途径，而湖北身份证也让他成为了人们警惕的对象，他被困在厦门，寸步难行。
With the spread of the new crown virus, he slowly lost access to supplies, and Hubei identity cards made him a vigilant target, trapped in Xiamen, unable to move.
。
.
最后，在一个早晨，有人叫醒了帐篷里的灰兔，带他去接受14天的隔离。
Finally, one morning, someone woke up the grey rabbit in the tent and took him to a 14-day quarantine.
。
.
他在微博上宣布了这个消息：“被捕是公路片的一环，不爽不要玩。
He posted the message on his microblog: "The arrest is part of a road show, so don't play.
”。
"
我是在一个游戏论坛里认识的灰兔。
I met Grey Rabbit in a game forum.
。
.
去年二月，灰兔在S1论坛发了个帖子，准备连载自己流浪一整年的日记。
Last February, the Greyhare posted a post at the S1 Forum, ready to keep a diary of his wanderings for a year.
帖子的开头写道：“因为一些个人原因，去骑行了。
"For personal reasons, I went cycling," the post began.
”。
"
所谓骑行，指的是字面意义上那种，最一穷二白的方式。
The so-called riding, refers to the literal sense of that, the most impoverished way.
在出发前，灰兔一把火烧掉了自己曾珍视的东西，比如日记手稿，还有最喜欢的衣服。
Before setting out, the hare set fire to something he had treasured, such as the manuscript of his diary and his favorite clothes.
在准备完自行车和帐篷睡袋等必需品之后，他捐掉了自己剩下的所有钱，就这样上路了。
After getting ready for his bike and tent sleeping bag, he donated all the money he had left and set off on his way.
。
.
灰兔计划这样在外面骑上一整年。
The Greyhare planned to ride outside for a whole year.
从上海出发，一路去到甘肃，再前往西南的四川和重庆，最后收尾定在广东，中间还要去一趟海南岛。
From Shanghai, all the way to Gansu, then southwest Sichuan and Chongqing, and finally end in Guangdong, in the middle of a trip to Hainan Island.
他表现得很谨慎，为了避免半途而废，他在出发一周之后才发了这个帖子。
He was careful not to give up halfway until he posted the post a week after his departure.
。
.
某种意义上如他所料，旅程的开头并不顺利。
In a sense, as he had expected, the beginning of the journey was not easy.
骑行的第一天就下了雨，湿透的他在一个天桥下扎帐篷过夜，一看时间，其实也就骑了两个小时。
It rained on the first day of the ride. Soaking wet, he pitched his tent under an overpass for the night.
。
.
骑行和淋雨带来的疼痛、水泥地面的不适还有二月的温度加在一起，让他度过了难忘的一夜，“凌晨四点才勉强睡着，疼到在帐篷里一个人哼哼”。
The pain of riding and drizzling, the discomfort of the concrete floor, and the February heat combined to give him an unforgettable night. "It was just four in the morning and it hurt to hum alone in the tent."
。
.
天桥下的第一夜。
The first night under the bridge.
看到这里，一些坛友开始关心灰兔的安危，也有人忍不住质疑，一条留言很不客气地预测他的结局：最后你怕不是要找人帮助瞎搞的自己，“感慨下世上还是有好人，然后找公安免费车票回家。
At the end of the day, you may be afraid that you are not looking for someone to help you make a fool of yourself. "You will sigh that there are still good people in the world and find a free ticket home.
”。
"
灰兔告诉我，在出发前，他也问过自己：这样骑行，会有生命危险吗？他又自己回答：“既然主要是在城市里骑行，不是那种门槛特别高的野外生存，不会有直接挂掉的风险，那就都不是问题。
The Hare told me that before he set out, he had asked himself, 'Is it dangerous to ride this way?' And he answered himself, 'Since it's mainly in the city, not in the wild, where the threshold is very high, and there is no risk of immediate death.
”。
"
除了担心他因为准备不足出什么状况之外，大家也都很在意另一件事情：你把钱都捐了，拿什么吃饭？。
Besides worrying about what might happen to him as a result of his lack of preparation, everyone was also concerned about another thing: What would you do if you donated all your money?
灰兔有他自己的解决方法，但很难说有多大的参考价值。
The Grey Rabbit has his own solution, but it's hard to say how valuable it is.
用论坛网友们的话讲，他这算是把技能点都加在了魅力上。
In the words of the forum netizens, he is adding the skill point to the charm.
。
.
作为最基础的准备，他背着几十块压缩饼干和一个杯子上路，能量来源就靠饼干，水则是在路边找饭店老板讨。
As the most basic preparation, he carried dozens of compressed biscuits and a cup on his back, relying on biscuits for energy and water from a roadside restaurant owner.
但这种看起来就营养匮乏的生活并没有持续多久，上路的第四天，他靠给饭店老板的孩子当临时家教换来了一顿丰盛的晚餐。
But this seemingly undernourished life did not last long, and on the fourth day of his journey he earned a sumptuous dinner by working as a temporary tutor for the proprietor's children.
。
.
骑行路上，第一顿像样的晚饭。
The first decent dinner on the ride.
又过了一天，灰兔干脆进了局子——他在公安局旁扎帐篷，结果被值班的警察邀请进去一起喝茶吃夜宵，“几个大叔往我怀里塞了八根肉串，哪天我都会开心死，可偏偏今天我晚饭吃太饱了。
The next day the Hare went straight to the station, where he pitched his tent next to the police station, and was invited by the policemen on duty to have tea and supper.
“。
"
然后警察同志硬是按住我让我吃完了，告诉我，还有，别停。
And then the cops just kept me down and let me finish. Tell me, and don't stop.
。
.
睡了一觉，灰兔甚至坐上了警车，过了一天跟着警察叔叔巡逻的生活。
After a sleep, the hare even got into the police car and spent the day patrolling with his uncle.
。
.
从那一天开始，骑行本身就很少再成为灰兔游记的主旋律。
From that day on, the ride itself rarely became the main theme of the Grey Rabbit Travels.
这其中当然有他自己技术日趋精进的原因，不过也与他关心的重点有关。
There is, of course, a reason why his own skills are becoming more sophisticated, but they are also relevant to his priorities.
。
.
灰兔告诉我，这一路上，骑车其实是最无聊的部分，“我最感兴趣的，其实是路上遇到什么人，又参与了什么事情。
'Cycling is actually the most boring part along the way, 'he told me.' What interests me most is who I meet on the road and what I do.
”。
"
在山西，灰兔和一位僧人同行了一段时间。
In Shanxi, the grey hare walked with a monk for some time.
那位僧人从河南出发，三步一叩首，去往五台山朝山，一路上靠信徒们的供养前进。
Departing from Henan, the monk kowtowed to the mountains of Wutai Mountain, relying on the sustenance of his followers.
。
.
他们一起在关公祠里扎帐篷、埋葬路遇的动物尸体、用信众赠送的橙色三轮车驮运物资，最后在一个晴朗的中午挥手告别。
Together, they packed the tents in his ancestral village, buried the carcasses of the animals they met, loaded the truck with the orange rickshaws donated by the faithful, and waved good-bye one fine noon.
如果这些事情不是来自他的记载，看起来就像一部公路片的剧情大纲。
If these things weren't from his records, they would look like a synopsis of a road show.
。
.
僧人百宝箱一样的三轮车。
Monastic treasure chest-like tricycle.
与人相关的其他事物也同样吸引着灰兔。
Other human-related things also attract the Grey Rabbit.
他在山西停留了很久，拿出时间去欣赏当地的各种文物。
He stayed in Shanxi for a long time and took time to enjoy the local cultural relics.
。
.
晋地古建筑的丰饶让灰兔非常惊讶。
The richness of the ancient architecture in Jindi surprised the Grey Rabbit.
他举例说，自己想去某个村子看很有名的文物，结果走错到了另一个地方，发现那里居然也有和目标年份差不多的文物。
He gave the example of going to a village to see a well-known cultural relic, only to go to another place, where he found that there was something similar to the target year.
“（那边）几乎见不到两三百年的，都是四五百年起。
Almost two or three hundred years (over there), four or five hundred.
”。
"
为了省钱，灰兔大多数时间都选择自己扎帐篷，有时候为了充电和清洁去住廉价旅馆，偶然认识的当地人提供的住处，还有经过的寺庙和道观，也都是他的栖身之所。
To save money, the Greyhare spent most of his time setting up his own tent, sometimes going to cheap hotels to recharge and clean, lodging provided by casual acquaintances, and passing temples and Taoism.
。
.
这种生活方式让他体会到了很多，“作为一个中国人，在我自己的国家，很多东西（之前）都被我直接忽略掉了，察觉不到。
This way of life taught him a lot. "As a Chinese, in my own country, a lot of things [were] directly overlooked and unnoticed by me.
”。
"
在湖州，他住进过一座小寺，还跟着寺里的人们做了晚课，结果发现出家人的生活也有喜剧，在自己的帖子里纪录了下来：。
In Huzhou, he lived in a small temple, and followed the temple people to do evening classes, only to find out that the lives of the family members are comedy, recorded in their own posts.
晚上突然看见沙弥来叫我们帮忙，原来是要往房梁上挂上经幡，从院子里拖过来两架竹梯靠在一起，在我目瞪口呆的表情里方丈摇摇晃晃爬上去，大家都闭嘴安静扶着梯子，播放器放着阿弥陀佛的声音，方丈上面没好气说：放个鬼的阿弥陀佛，给我放大悲咒！。
Suddenly I saw the sami come to ask for our help. It was a prayer prayer hanging on the beam and two bamboo ladders leaning against each other in the courtyard. The two bamboo ladders crawled in my dumbfounded expression.
一位网友在下面解释：“大悲咒是千手千眼观音的，想也知道特别适合干手艺活的时候，而阿弥陀佛是西天往生的，你仔细体会一下……”。
A netizen explained: "The Great Scourge is a thousand-eyed Quan Yin, and you want to know that it is especially suitable for doing craft work, and Amitabha was born in the west, you know.
但灰兔也并没有在寺里停留太久。
But the hares did not stay in the temple for long.
当被寺院住持邀请留下来住上一个月的时候，他突然怀疑自己的行动力正在减弱，于是几乎落荒而逃式的离开，“方丈念诵了一遍普贤菩萨的十大誓愿，祝福我一路百邪不侵，我祝他佛法精进香火昌盛，就此别过。
When he was invited by the abbot of the monastery to stay for a month, he suddenly suspected that his power of action was waning and he almost fled away. "The abbot recited the Ten Vows of Puritan Bodhisattva.
”。
"
从江南启程的旅人一路蜿蜒北上，沿着河南和山西到达内蒙古。
Travelers from south China meander northward all the way to Inner Mongolia along Henan and Shanxi.
。
.
在内蒙，灰兔遇到了一位车筐里坐了条狗的大爷。
In Inner Mongolia, the Greyhare met a big man with a dog in the basket.
和这位大爷聊了聊，他才知道自己是遇到同行了。
After talking to the old man, he realized that he was in the same boat.
灰兔出来五个月，大爷是四个半月，目标都是骑完全国。
Grey rabbit out for five months, uncle is four and a half months, the goal is to ride all over the country.
。
.
狗是流浪狗。
A dog is a stray dog.
大爷在呼和浩特遇见它，喂了根火腿肠，它就跟上车了。
Grandpa met him in Hohhot, fed him a ham sausage, and he got on the bus.
大爷说，狗旺财，是白龙驹，丢不得。
He said, "Dog is rich, is a foal, can not be lost."
。
.
大爷给狗狗起名叫“远征”。
The old man named the dog "Expedition."
同行路上，灰兔注意到大爷的车是辆很旧的捷安特，大爷就讲了他的故事。
On the way, the Greyhare noticed that his car was an old Jeanette, and he told his story.
大爷今年五十二岁，车和帐篷都是十一年前准备好的——骑行环游中国是他十年前的愿望，他花了足足一年准备好全部的装备，却因为家里的老人不同意而中止。
Grandpa was fifty-two years old, and the car and tent were all prepared eleven years ago--he had wanted to ride around China ten years ago, and he had spent a year getting all his gear together when the old man in the house didn't agree.
。
.
之后，大爷等了整整十年，原本想等到退休，但突然意识到自己已经很老了，不能再等了，就上了路。
After that, he waited for ten years and wanted to wait until he retired. Suddenly he realized that he was too old to wait any longer.
他的目标不光要骑完全国三十四个省会直辖市，还要每去一个省份捐一千块钱，把自己的爱心献满全国。
His goal is not only to ride the country's 34 provincial capitals, but also to donate a thousand dollars to each province to offer his love throughout the country.
。
.
两人的路线原本一致，但灰兔在路上突发急性咽炎，只能原地停留几天养病，让大爷先走。
The two originally agreed on the route, but the rabbit in the road acute pharyngitis, can only stay in place for a few days to recover from illness, let Grandpa go first.
走之前，大爷特地买了一大袋酸奶给灰兔补身体，他本想推辞，但大爷说“这儿的酸奶只要三块钱一斤”，只得作罢。
Before he left, he bought a large bag of yoghurt specially to fill his body. He tried to refuse, but he said, "The yogurt here is only three yuan a catty," so he had to stop.
。
.
身体好转后，灰兔的路线又折向了西边，目标是取道甘肃入新疆，终点是接近哈萨克斯坦边境的赛里木湖，最后从伊宁坐车去西安。
After his health improved, the Grey Rabbit turned westward, aiming to cross into Xinjiang via Gansu Province and end at Serimu Lake, near the Kazakhstan border, before taking a bus from Yining to Xi'an.
。
.
灰兔原本以为，这条属于他的“丝绸之路”上最大的BOSS会是平均海拔三千多米的祁连山，地图上显示一路都是爬升，困难前所未有。
The Greyhare thought that the biggest BOSS on his Silk Road would be Qilian Mountain with an average altitude of more than 3,000 meters.
。
.
结果在塔尔寺规划路线的时候，他突然发现离青海湖只剩下一百多公里的路上有两座山，海拔都不低，灰兔琢磨“这怕不是个祁连山Lily”。
As he was planning his route at the Tarsus, he suddenly noticed that there were only two mountains more than a hundred kilometers from Qinghai Lake. They were not low above sea level.
。
.
等到上路了，他才知道这两座无名山比祁连山海拔还高，遂去帖子里感叹：“新手村的史莱姆比最终BOSS还强是怎么回事啊！”。
When he was on his way, he found out that the two unnamed mountains were higher than Qilian Mountain, so he went to post and said, "What's the matter with Slyme in Xingang village better than BOSS in the end?"
整个旅行的过程，大抵如此。
The whole journey is pretty much the same.
灰兔曾经在路上碰到驴友问他“有没有想过放弃这件事”，灰兔说，自己一天大概少说要想一百多次吧，但还是坚持下来了，“大概是因为运气好”。
The hare had met a hiker on the way and asked him if he had thought about giving it up, said the hare. He probably thought about it at least a hundred times a day, but he stuck with it, probably because of good luck.
。
.
就这样，他一路到了青海湖。
So he went all the way to Qinghai Lake.
扎人的草梗睡在他的脚下，强风拂过他的帐篷。
Tough grass stalks sleep at his feet, and strong winds blow through his tent.
他遇见成群开车郊游的僧人，提醒他不能在湖边扎营（“你想死吗？”）的牧民，然后黄昏到来，“云层绯红，像少女的脸颊，柔软的冰山”。
He meets herdsmen who drive around in groups, reminds him that he can't camp by the lake ("Do you want to die?"), and comes dusk, "Clouds are crimson, like girlish cheeks, soft icebergs."
。
.
这是灰兔在青藏高原的最后一夜。
It was Grey Rabbit's last night on the Tibetan Plateau.
。
.
之后，他花了四天三夜翻越祁连山。
After that, he spent four days and three nights crossing Qilian Mountains.
爬升的路途辛苦，不过他碰到了主动帮忙的当地司机。
It was a hard climb, but he met a local driver who offered to help.
这样的好心人灰兔路上遇到过很多次，以往是大车直接载他走，这次则是把自行车拴在摩托上，拉着他上了山。
Such a kind-hearted grey hare had encountered many times on the road, used to drive him directly from the cart, this time tied his bicycle to his motorcycle and dragged him up the mountain.
灰兔管这种搭便车叫“机械飞升”（《群星》中的文明飞升途径之一）。
This hitchhiker is called a "mechanical ascent" (one of the paths of civilization in "The Stars").
。
.
旅途开始前，灰兔曾经觉得，在你没走之前，世界可能看上去很小，就像一张地图，从一个点画到另一个点就过去了。
Before the trip began, the Greyhare felt that the world might seem small before you left, just like a map, drawn from point to point.
直到亲身去经历，才知道我们所生活的土地究竟有多广袤，走起来有多难。
It is not until we experience it that we know how vast and difficult the land we live on is.
。
.
翻过祁连山，在从张掖到玉门关的路上，灰兔又遇见了一个叫阿童的资深骑行客。
Over Qilian Mountain, in the road from Zhangye to Yumen Pass, Grey Rabbit met a senior cyclist named Ah Tong.
他们一同在小镇里补给的时候，灰兔收到了之前的大爷发来的语音。
As they were resupplying the town together, the Grey Rabbit received a voice from the old man.
。
.
阿童看了眼手机，愣了下，把自己的手机也给灰兔看，结果微信界面上出现了同一个人。
Ah Tong looked at the mobile phone, Leng next, his mobile phone to the gray rabbit to see, resulting in the micro-letter interface on the same person.
。
.
阿童说，自己是在骑行全国路过南昌的时候认识的大爷。
A Tong said that he was riding through the country when Nanchang met the grandfather.
大爷把他拉到家里招待，然后告诉他，自己也想骑车。
He took him home as a waitress and told him he wanted to ride too.
过了几年，大爷出发了，在内蒙碰到了灰兔，灰兔又在张掖的一片荒野里遇见了阿童。
After a few years, the uncle set out, in Inner Mongolia met Grey Rabbit, gray rabbit in a wilderness Zhang Ye met Ah Tong.
。
.
世界确实很小，小得像一张地图。
The world is really small, small as a map.
。
.
灰兔和阿童的帐篷。
The tents of Grey Rabbit and Arden.
到了新疆，旅程变得更加艰难起来。
In Xinjiang, the journey became more difficult.
西北的朋友在给灰兔指路的时候，会告诉他哪些路危险，走哪些路能活下来。
Friends in the Northwest would tell the Greyhare which roads were dangerous and which would survive when they showed him the way.
而到了新疆，朋友给他指路，“会说走这条路好，这样可以死得有尊严点。
When he got to Xinjiang, his friend showed him the way. "It's a good way to die with dignity.
”。
"
朋友没骗他。
The friend didn't lie to him.
到戈壁后，地图上两个有意义的点之间的最短距离，通常是三百公里。
To Gobi, the shortest distance between two meaningful points on the map, usually three hundred kilometers.
骑行者在路上，水饮尽，烈日灼，两条道路旁却只有无尽的荒地，连一根草都没有。
The rider was on the road, drinking and scorching, but there was no grass beside the two roads.
。
.
出戈壁后，手机有了信号，他质问朋友“这么大段的无人区为啥一点提示都没有，我差点栽在里面”，朋友答，“这很正常啊，新疆到哪都是几百公里的无人区，这都是常识，不需要说的。
After Gobi, the mobile phone has a signal, he asked his friend "so large no man's land why there is no hint, I almost planted in it," the friend replied, "it is normal, Xinjiang is hundreds of kilometers to no man's land, this is common sense.
”。
"
这就是新疆。
This is Xinjiang.
旅途讲述到这里已经格外漫长，用灰兔的话来说叫“泛善可陈”，到处都有可说的小故事，但也只是小故事。
The journey to here has been exceptionally long, in the words of the Grey Rabbit called "good can Chen," there are little stories to tell, but only small stories.
从雪落骑到春秋，骑着骑着就过去了。
From the snow to the spring and autumn, riding on the past.
。
.
他骑过了很多地方，哈密、柳园、星星峡，伊犁、奎屯、石河子。
He has ridden many places, Hami, Liuyuan, Xingxing Gorge, Ili, Kuitun, Shihezi.
。
.
灰兔连载的帖子节选。
Excerpt from the post of Grey Rabbit.
一路骑行，一路直到能看见“披纱的山脉，水雾从山脚下白练般扬起……另一面是山脉绵长正迎着太阳，背后攒拥着积雪般的云幔”，灰兔知道，赛里木湖到了。
I rode all the way until I could see the "capped mountains, the mist rising from the foot of the mountain... and on the other side the mountains were long and facing the sun, with snow-covered clouds behind them," the Greyhare knew that Lake Serimu had arrived.
。
.
赛里木湖修整过后，灰兔回了伊宁，坐火车到西安，随后扎进了西南部的山区中。
After repairing the lake, the grey hare went back to Yining, took a train to Xi'an, and then plunged into the mountains of the southwest.
他花了两个月离开群山，在海南环岛一圈，然后继续沿着海岸线北上。
It took him two months to leave the mountains, make a circuit of Hainan Island, and then continue his journey north along the coastline.
。
.
这时已经是冬天。
It was winter now.
计划里的一年期限将要到来时，他意识到自己的旅程快要接近终点了。
As the planned one-year deadline approached, he realized that his journey was nearing its end.
他在山西阅尽了数百年前业已矗立的古建，在内蒙途径苍天般的阿拉善，在甘肃翻越了绵延万里的祁连山，也曾到达过高原上的赛里木湖和青海湖，之后又从西南横穿整个中国到了海南岛沿海骑行，“一下子，所有东西都看够了。
He spent hundreds of years in Shanxi to see the ancient buildings that had stood hundreds of years ago. He crossed the Tiananshan Mountains in Gansu Province, reached the Selimu Lake and Qinghai Lake in the plateau, then crossed China from the southwest to the coast of Hainan Island.
”。
"
该回去了。
It's time to go back.
。
.
在灰兔的计划中，他的流浪生活有两种结束的方案：一是走回自己来时的道路，再去找当时遇到的人们聊聊天；二是以新的挑战作为结尾，去漠河或者西藏。
In the Grey Rabbit's scheme, there were two ways to end his wanderings: one was to walk back to the road he had come to, then talk to the people he had met; the other was to end up in the desert or Tibet with a new challenge.
在那之后，就是回家，“我本来这时候该在家里玩《怪物猎人：冰原》的！”。
After that, back home, "I was supposed to be at home playing Monster Hunter: The Ice Age!"
就在这个时候，疫情来了。
Just then, the outbreak came.
。
.
武汉封城那天，灰兔在帖子里更新了自己此刻的感受，配图是月球上的宇航员错愕地看着地球被陨石砸穿。
Wuhan on the day, the gray rabbit in the post updated their feelings at the moment, with the map of the moon astronauts stunned to see the earth was smashed by meteorites.
。
.
起初，他和大多数人一样以为影响不会很大，充其量是东西会贵一些、难买一些，但直到他发现自己在郊区骑行40公里都找不到一家开着的饭店时，才意识到了问题的严重性。
At first he thought, like most people, that the impact would not be great, that things would be more expensive and difficult to buy, but he did not realize the seriousness of the problem until he found himself riding 40 kilometers through the suburbs without a hotel open.
。
.
家也回不去了。
Home can't go back.
妈妈还在湖北，给他发信息严禁他回去：“你就在外面呆着，最好是荒郊野外，我现在一点都不想你回来……再不行，你滚到尼泊尔去吧！”。
Mother is still in Hubei, send him a message forbid him to go back: "You stay outside, preferably in the wilderness, I do not want you back now... no more, you go to Nepal!"
那个时候，他正在厦门周边，发现全国对于疫情的控制正在收紧，街道上行人日渐稀少，道路设卡确认身份。
At the time, he was around Xiamen, and found that nationwide control of the epidemic was tightening, with fewer and fewer pedestrians on the streets and road signs confirming his identity.
灰兔的湖北身份证让他变成了实体化的年兽，没有旅店愿意让他投宿，飞翔的湖北人只能继续飞行。
Hare's Hubei identity card turned him into a solid year beast, no hotel willing to let him sleep, flying Hubei people can only continue to fly.
。
.
但这段真正无家可归的生活也没有持续多久。
But this truly homeless life did not last long either.
。
.
像整个故事开头所说，三天后的早晨，灰兔被人从叫醒，一位好心的乡镇干部安排他住进了隔离用的酒店。
As the story begins, the Grey Rabbit was woken up three days later, and a well-meaning township official placed him in a secluded hotel.
。
.
被隔离的生活，差不多是骑行生活的完全反面。
Living in isolation is almost the opposite of riding a life.
灰兔宅了下来，窝在房间里看岚少的《黑暗之魂2》视频、拿着iPad玩《帕斯卡契约》（然后认为“搓玻璃”是没有未来的）、看漫画，和自己大多数同胞的日常一致。
Grey rabbit mansion down, nest in the room to see fewer "soul of darkness" video, holding the iPad to play "Pascal Contract" (and then think that "rubbing glass" is no future), read cartoons, and most of the daily lives of his compatriots.
。
.
他在那一直待到2月10号，然后拿着一张“良民证”继续上路。
He stayed there until February 10th, then continued on his way with a "good citizenship card."
在走之前，酒店的经理打来电话，让他加一下微信，说他们老板觉得他环游中国不容易，给他打了一千块钱。
Before he left, the manager of the hotel called and asked him to add a message that his boss thought it was not easy for him to travel around China and gave him a thousand dollars.
。
.
他把这笔钱也都捐了。
He contributed the money as well.
。
.
接下来，灰兔原本的计划是骑去福州，看看情况再做决定，但实际上连“看看情况”也被证明是条只存在于假想中的道路。
Next, the rabbit's original plan was to ride to Fuzhou to see what happened before making a decision, but even "look at the situation" proved to be a hypothetical path.
骑行的大部分时间都浪费在接受盘问和等候处理中，而他的湖北身份让健康证明都顺带着颇显可疑。
Much of the ride was wasted in questioning and waiting to be processed, and his Hubei identity made the medical certificates suspicious.
。
.
疫情发生之前，一个在城市里扎帐篷的人可能会成为人们搭讪的对象，但现在情况发生了改变。
Before the outbreak, a man setting up a tent in the city might have been the object of accost, but things have changed.
。
.
灰兔告诉我，有次一位保安走过来找他聊天，问他是怎么骑车，从哪过来的。
Greyhare told me that once a security guard came to talk to him and asked him how he rode and where he came from.
他说他从上海出发，保安突然愣了一下， 问，你是不是武汉的。
He said he started from Shanghai, the security guard suddenly froze, asked, you are not Wuhan.
他说，不是，我是湖北的，但我有隔离证书。
No, he said, I'm from Hubei, but I have an isolation certificate.
保安立刻向后退了五米，并没有看那张“良民证”，迅速离去。
The security guard immediately stepped back five meters, did not see the "good citizen card," quickly left.
。
.
那张实际上没什么用处的“良民证”。
The "good citizen card" that is actually of no use.
在一个用来和各地朋友交流近况的群里，他自嘲地把自己的群昵称改成了“福建瘟疫骑士”。
In a group used to communicate with friends around the world, he laughed at himself for changing his group nickname to "Fujian Plague Knight."
。
.
瘟疫骑士最终也没有走出厦门。
The plague knight also did not leave Xiamen eventually.
他接受了当地朋友的一些帮助，还被一位好心大姐带去居委会里扎帐篷睡了一晚。
He received some help from his local friends and was taken by a kind-hearted older sister to spend the night in a neighborhood tent in Riza.
在突如其来的病毒面前，骑行结束了。
In the face of the sudden virus, the ride is over.
。
.
当我写下这篇文章的时候，灰兔已经回到他之前接受隔离的酒店，成为了一名志愿者。
By the time I wrote this, the Grey Rabbit had returned to his previously isolated hotel and had become a volunteer.
那个曾经转给过他路费的酒店经理打电话过来，问他有没有地方住，说既然没地方可去，干脆继续回他们那里。
The manager of the hotel, who had transferred the money to him, called and asked if he had any place to stay. Since there was no place to go, he simply went back to them.
。
.
作为一个365天没有回过湖北的持证健康人，灰兔被穿着防护服的人消毒，然后安排住回了熟悉的房间。
As a healthy and documented person who had not returned to Hubei for 365 days, the grey rabbit was disinfected by people in protective clothing and arranged to return to a familiar room.
作为志愿者，他等了半天，最后忍不住打电话过去，希望能做点什么。
As a volunteer, he waited for a long time and finally could not help but call and hope to do something about it.
对方告诉他，“时间到了会让你出来，出来的时间，待定”。
The other side told him, "Time will let you out, time to come out, to be determined."
。
.
这个飞翔了一整年的湖北人，坐在自己一整年里待得最久的地方，开始了又一次等待。
The Hubei, who had been flying all year, sat where he had been for the longest time in a year, and began to wait again.
。
.
就像许多城市里千千万万的其他人一样。
Like millions of other people in many cities.
。
.

文章本身故事写的很棒，这位骑行者本人也很棒，只可惜最后结局令人哭笑不得的同时，居然有种升华主题，暗示人性的错觉。
The article itself is well written, and the cyclist himself is wonderful, but the end result is so distressing that there is a sublimation theme that hints at the delusion of humanity.
最有意思的是暗线居然是游戏，不仅不突兀反而让人物形象更加丰富。
The most interesting thing is that the dark line is a game, not just suddenly but also to enrich the character image.
