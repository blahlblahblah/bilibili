世卫组织总干事说，新冠肺炎的传播效率低于流感，传播似乎并非由未患病的人所驱动。
The WHO director-general says the spread of pneumonia is less efficient than that of influenza and does not appear to be driven by people who are not ill.
这意味着，其所引发的疫情是可以被遏制的。
This means that the outbreak it causes can be contained.
但近期疫情在全球蔓延，仍令各界人士深表担忧。
However, the recent global spread of the epidemic is still a source of deep concern.
本文2717字，阅读全文约5分钟文 |《财经》记者 信娜 孙爱民编辑 | 王小当新冠病毒开始在全球超过40个国家或地区出现，人们越来越多地将它与另一种呼吸道传染病——流感，相提并论。
New Crown Virus Wang Xiaodang has begun to appear in more than 40 countries or regions around the world, and is increasingly being compared with flu, another respiratory infection.
“新冠肺炎的传播效率低于流感，传播似乎并非由未患病的人所驱动”。
"Coronary pneumonia is less effective than influenza, and transmission does not seem to be driven by people who are not ill."
2020年3月3日，世界卫生组织（WHO）总干事谭德塞在新冠肺炎疫情媒体通报会上说。
On March 3, 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) Director General Lindsay Tan told a news briefing on the New Crown Pneumonia epidemic.
虽然从病毒传播力来看，新冠病毒高于流感，但WHO认为，后者的传播效率更高。
Although the new crown virus is higher than the flu in terms of transmission, the World Health Organization says the latter is more efficient.
谭德塞称，区别在于，两者的主要传播驱动因素不同。
The difference, says Mr Tanner, is that the two main drivers of transmission are different.
流感中，被感染但尚未患病的人是主要传染者，但新冠肺炎的传播并非如此。
In influenza, infected but not yet sick people are the main carriers, but the spread of new crown pneumonia is not.
来自中国的证据表明，只有1%的报告病例没有症状，大多数病例在2天内出现症状。
Evidence from China suggests that only 1 per cent of reported cases are asymptomatic, with most cases showing symptoms within two days.
一位流行病专家对《财经》记者分析，“我们可以在第一点上快速地识别并遏制新冠肺炎传播，并不会像流感传播得那么快速”。
"We can quickly identify and contain the spread of new crown pneumonia on the first point, not as quickly as the flu," an epidemiologist told Caijing.
据WHO报告，截至欧洲中部时间3 月3 日上午10时，中国境外共有72 个国家确诊新冠肺炎10566 例，死亡共计166 例。
As of 10 a.m. March 3, Central Europe time, 10,566 new cases and 166 deaths had been confirmed in 72 countries outside China, the World Health Organization reported.
其中，80%的病例来自韩国、伊朗和意大利。
Of these, 80 per cent came from South Korea, Iran and Italy.
WHO已将新冠肺炎疫情级别由此前的“高”，上调至“非常高”的水平。
The WHO has raised the level of pneumonia in the new crown to a "very high" level from its previous high.
这是WHO风险评估的最高级。
This is the highest level of WHO risk assessment.
“新冠病毒引发的疾病比流感严重。
"Crown virus-induced diseases are more serious than influenza.
我们有针对季节性流感的疫苗和治疗方法，但目前尚无针对COVID-19（新冠肺炎）的疫苗和特殊治疗方法。
We have vaccines and treatments for seasonal influenza, but there are no vaccines or special treatments for COVID-19.
”谭德塞说。
'she said.
世卫组织：新冠病毒传播效率低于流感“新冠肺炎的传播效率低于流感”，这是WHO分析现有数据后的结论。
WHO: New Crown Virus Spreads Less Efficient than Influenza "New Crown Pneumonia Spreads Less Efficient than Influenza," WHO concluded after analysing available data.
两者同为呼吸道疾病，主要传播方式相同，均为飞沫传播，这些飞沫可能来自患者的鼻腔或口腔。
Both are respiratory diseases and the main modes of transmission are droplets, which may come from the nose or mouth of the patient.
谭德塞这样解释两者的差别，就流感而言，被感染但尚未患病的人是主要的传播驱动因素，而新冠病毒似乎并非如此，它的传播目前看并非由未患病的人所驱动，来自中国的证据表明，只有1%的报告病例没有症状，大多数病例在2天内出现症状。
In the case of influenza, infected but uninfected people appear to be the main transmission drivers, whereas the spread of the new crown virus does not seem to be driven by uninfected people. Evidence from China suggests that only 1 per cent of reported cases are asymptomatic, with most cases showing symptoms within two days.
这也是为何至今医学界没有谈论过季节性流感的控制措施，因为针对季节性流感进行接触者追踪是不可能的。
That is why the medical community has so far refrained from talking about seasonal flu control measures, because it is impossible to track those who come into contact with seasonal flu.
但遏制新冠肺炎是可能的，可针对新冠病毒进行接触者追踪，来预防感染，因而遏制新冠病毒的人间传播是可以实现的。
But containment of Newcrown Pneumonia is possible, and can be prevented by targeting those who come into contact with the new crown virus, thereby limiting human transmission of the virus.
一位流行病学专家对《财经》记者分析，无症状或初发新冠肺炎病人的疾病传播力并不强，虽然存在无症状传播者等情况，但大多数传播行为发生在有症状的患者身上。
An epidemiologist told Caijing that the spread of disease in asymptomatic or nocturnal pneumonia patients was weak, with asymptomatic transmission occurring, for example, in symptomatic patients.
“我们可以在第一点上快速地识别并遏制病毒传播，使其不会像流感传播得那么快速”。
"We can quickly identify and contain the spread of the virus on the first point so that it does not spread as quickly as the flu," he said.
2月29日，国家卫健委官网发布的《中国-世界卫生组织新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）联合考察报告》中也提到，真正的无症状感染者的比例尚不明确，但相对较罕见，也不是传播的主要驱动因素。
The report of the joint China-World Health Organization (WHO) Coronavirus Pneumonia (COVID-19) report released on February 29 by the National Health Officers' Network also noted that the true rate of asymptomatic infection is unclear, but relatively rare and not a major driver of transmission.
虽然传播效率不高，但基于现有研究，新冠肺炎的传播力显著高于流感。
Although transmission efficiency is not high, based on existing studies, the transmission of new crown pneumonia is significantly higher than that of influenza.
1月29日，一篇发表在《新英格兰医学杂志》的论文揭示了新冠病毒的早期传播能力。
A paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine on January 29 revealed the early spread of the new crown virus.
研究者在分析了武汉市前425例确诊病例后，得出结论，平均每个新冠患者会传染给2.2个未患病的人。
After analyzing 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan, the researchers concluded that, on average, every new crown patient infects 2.2 people who are not ill.
目前，病毒传播力的大小一般用“基本再生数”（basic reproductive number，R0）来标识，是指一个病例在传染期内，平均会传染的新病例的预期数量。
At present, the virus transmission capacity is generally marked by "basic reproductive number" (R0), refers to the expected number of new cases of infection during the period of infection, on average.
通常，只要该数值大于1，流行病就会增加，而控制措施的目的就在于将该数值降低到1以下。
Normally, an epidemic increases as long as the value is greater than 1, and control measures are aimed at reducing that value below 1.
不过上述论文的研究者称，其对新冠肺炎的“基本再生数”的估计，仅限于1月4日以前。
But the authors of the paper said their estimate of the "basic number of regenerations" of pneumonia was limited to the period before January 4.
欧洲疾病预防控制中心（ECDC）给出的数据是，新冠病毒的R0值约为2.2。
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) gives a R0 value of about 2.2 for the new crown virus.
这一数值与SARS病毒的传播力相当，后者R0在2到3之间。
This value is comparable to the transmission of the SARS virus, which ranges from 2 to 3.
ECDC发布的2009年流感的数据是：R0在1.1与1.4之间。
The ECDC released flu data for 2009: R0 between 1.1 and 1.4.
中国工程院院士李兰娟等研究者在infectious Microbes & Diseases(简称IMD)上发表的论文显示，2017年到2018年，中国发生的流感的R0是1.53。
Researchers such as Li Lanjuan, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, say the R0 level for flu in China from 2017 to 2018 was 1.53, according to a paper published by Chinese Academy of Engineering & nbsp; & # 160; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & # 160; & # 160; & # 160; & # 160; & # 160; & # 160; & # 160; & # 160; & # 160; & # 160; & # 160; & # 160; & # 160; & # 160; & # 160; & # 160; & # 160; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
尽管病毒基因组很快被破译，国内外多篇论文也揭示了基因组特征，但这些特征还难以解释新冠病毒的强传播力。
Although the viral genomes were quickly deciphered, and many papers at home and abroad revealed genomic characteristics, they do not explain the strong propagation of the new crown virus.
3月3日，中国科学院主办的《国家科学评论》发表题为《关于SARS-CoV-2的起源和持续进化》的论文，研究人员分析了103个新冠病毒基因组数据发现，一共存在149个突变位点，且多数突变在近期发生。
On March 3, the National Science Review, hosted by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, published a paper entitled "Origin and Continuing Evolution of SARS-CoV-2," in which researchers analysed 103 genome data of the new crown virus and found 149 mutations, most of which occurred recently.
南方医科大学P3实验室副主任张宝对《财经》记者分析，100多个突变位点，说明病毒的变异并不大，病毒还算比较稳定。
Zhang Bao, deputy director of the P3 lab at Southern Medical University, told Caijing that more than 100 mutation sites suggested the virus was not mutating so much that the virus was relatively stable.
此外，该研究人员分析的103个病毒株中，有101个属于两个亚型之一。
In addition, 101 of the 103 strains analysed by the researchers belonged to one of two subtypes.
具体而言，两个亚型的区别在于病毒RNA基因组的第28144位点，L型是T碱基（对应亮氨酸，Leu），S型是C碱基（对应丝氨酸，Ser）。
Specifically, the difference between the two subtypes is the 28144 locus of the viral RNA genome, L-bases (corresponding to leucine, Leu) and S-bases (corresponding to serine, Ser).
基因组数据表明L型占70%，S型占30%，且每个L型病毒株比S型携带了相对较多的新生突变。
Genomic data show that L-type is 70% and S-type 30%, and that each L-strain carries relatively more new mutations than S-type.
目前，还没有相关证据阐释两个亚型之间传播力的差异。
At present, there is no evidence to explain the difference in transmission force between the two subtypes.
此前，美国国立卫生研究院(NIH)与德克萨斯大学奥斯汀分校Jason S.McLellan研究组进行合作，利用冷冻电镜技术分析发现，新冠病毒和SARS病毒的S蛋白具有相同的功能性宿主细胞ACE2，但前者的ACE2胞外域吸引力，比SARS病毒高出10—20倍。
Earlier, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), in collaboration with the Jason S. McLellan research group at the University of Texas at Austin, used cryoscopy technology to analyze that the S protein of the new crown virus and SARS virus has the same functional host cell ACE2, but the former has an ACE2 exogenous attraction 10-20 times higher than the SARS virus.
张宝分析，病毒的传播能力和致死率，更多要从病毒本身的性质来找答案，包括病毒的入侵、脱壳、RNA转录合成、蛋白质翻译组装、病毒成熟、释放等多个方面。
Zhang Bao analysis, the virus transmission capacity and death rate, more to find the nature of the virus itself to find answers, including virus invasion, desquamation, RNA transcription synthesis, protein translation assembly, virus ripening, release, and so on.
这方面研究还不多，不过，中国科研在这方面这些年进步非常大，未来几个月到半年内将会有成果出来。
There has not been much research in this area, but China's scientific research has made great progress in recent years and will bear fruit in the next few months to six months.
新冠肺炎死亡率高于季节性流感新冠肺炎与流感的区别，不止于此。
The death rate of Newly Coronary Pneumonia is higher than the difference between seasonal influenza pneumonia and influenza.
“新冠肺炎比季节性流感更为严重。
"Crown pneumonia is more serious than seasonal flu.
”谭德塞在上述通报会上提到了两者的第二个区别。
Tanner mentioned the second difference at the briefing.
新冠肺炎引发结果更为严重的原因有两点，一是没有人对新冠病毒有免疫力，二是病死率。
The new crown pneumonia is more serious because no one is immune to the new crown virus and because of the fatality rate.
谭德塞解释，尽管全球许多人已经具备对季节性流感毒株的免疫力，但新冠病毒（COVID-19）是一种新病毒，没有人对其具有免疫力。
Despite the fact that many people around the world are already immune to seasonal flu strains, the New Crown Virus (COVID-19) is a new virus and no one is immune to it, he explains.
这意味着更多的人容易被感染，有些人会患上严重疾病。
This means that more people are vulnerable to infection, and some people suffer from serious diseases.
谭德塞在发言中介绍了全球疫情的最新情况：在全球范围内，约有3.4%的新冠肺炎报告病例已经死亡。
In his presentation, Mr. Tanner provided an update on the global epidemic: globally, about 3.4 per cent of reported cases of new crown pneumonia had died.
相比之下，季节性流感导致的感染者死亡病例远低于1%。
Seasonal flu-related deaths, by contrast, are far less than 1 per cent.
此前，上述“中国-世界卫生组织联合考察报告”中，在中国，疫情暴发早期的粗病死率较高，1 月1 日至10日间发病的病例，粗病死率为17.3%;随着时间推移，2 月1 日之后发病病例的粗病死率降至0.7%。
Earlier, in the above-mentioned report on the China-WHO Joint Mission, China had a high crude death rate in the early stages of the outbreak, with a crude fatality rate of 17.3 percent in the period from January 1 to 10.
联合考察组注意到，医疗服务水平在疫情进展过程中发生了变化。
The joint mission noted that the level of health services had changed over time as the epidemic progressed.
大部分患者(77.8%)年龄在30至69 岁之间，其中，重症和死亡高危人群为年龄60岁以上。
The majority of patients (77.8 per cent) are between 30 and 69 years of age, of whom the most at-risk group is over 60 years of age.
后者临床表现为，呼吸困难或衰竭，血氧饱和度低等。
The latter clinical manifestations were dyspnea or failure, low blood oxygen saturation, etc.
病死率随年龄增长而增加，80岁以上者病死率最高，为21.9%。
The fatality rate increases with age, with the highest rate at 21.9 per cent among persons over 80 years of age.
上述报告提到，有合并症的患者病死率显著增高，这其中，合并心血管疾病患者病死率为13.2%，其后依次为合并糖尿病、高血压、慢性呼吸道疾病及癌症患者。
The above-mentioned report mentioned a significant increase in the mortality rate among patients with co-morbidities, which was 13.2 per cent, followed by diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic respiratory diseases and cancer.
从现有数据来看，新冠肺炎的病死率，低于同为冠状病毒家族成员的SARS及中东呼吸综合征(MERS)。
According to the available data, the mortality rate of Coronavirus is lower than that of SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), both members of the coronavirus family.
根据WHO的报告，SARS的病死率（CFR）是15%，MERS的病死率是34.4%。
According to the WHO, the death rate from SARS was 15% and that from MERS was 34.4%.
谭德塞认为，相比季节性流感，遏制新冠肺炎蔓延是可能的。
Tanner says it is possible to contain the spread of pneumonia in the new crown than seasonal flu.
“我们不会针对季节性流感进行接触者追踪，但各国应当针对COVID-19进行接触者追踪，因为这能预防感染和挽救生命。
"We don't track people who come into contact with seasonal flu, but countries should track those who come into contact with COVID-19 because it prevents infections and saves lives.
