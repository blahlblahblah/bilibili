中华预防医学会专家组：“拐点并不是黎明前的黑暗，只相当于夜里12点”。
"The inflection point is not the darkness before dawn, but the equivalent of 12 at night," said the group of experts of the Chinese Preventive Medicine Society.

“疾控要像消防一样，在疫情处置中有决定权、处置权”从大年初六（1月30日）开始，中国疾控中心首任主任、北大公共卫生学院教授李立明再次“出山”，带领一批国内公共卫生领域的骨干们集中办公。
"The disease control should be like fire control, in the disposal of the disease decision-making power," the Chinese CDC's first director, Professor Li Liming of the Beijing University School of Public Health, began on January 30, leading a group of cadres in the domestic public health field.
他率领的这个团队的名字叫“中华预防医学会新型冠状病毒感染肺炎防控专家组”，工作内容主要包括研判整个疫情防控运行的情况，提供防控技术的支撑，并作舆情监测。
He led the team called the "Chinese Preventive Medicine Society of the new coronavirus infection pneumonia prevention and control team," the work of the work mainly includes assessing the situation of the entire epidemic prevention and control operation, providing support for prevention and control technology, and monitoring public opinion.
2月16日，就在新冠肺炎疫情防控的关键时期，专家组主要成员集中接受了《中国新闻周刊》的采访。
On 16 February, during a critical period in the prevention and control of the New Crown Pneumonia epidemic, key members of the Group focused on an interview with China News Weekly.
受访专家除李立明外，还包括：江苏省预防医学会会长、原江苏省疾控中心主任、省卫生厅副厅长汪华；复旦大学公共卫生学院原院长、流行病学教授、原澳门政府卫生局顾问姜庆五；广州市妇女儿童医疗中心临床研究总监、香港中文大学流行病学荣休教授唐金陵；中山大学公共卫生学院院长、医学统计与流行病学系教授郝元涛；南京医科大学研究生院院长、公共卫生学院生物统计学教授陈峰；安徽省疾控中心原主任任军等。
Besides Li, experts interviewed included: Wang Hua, former director of Jiangsu Provincial CDC and vice-director of provincial health department; Tang Jinling, former Dean of Fudan University School of Public Health, Professor of Epidemiology, CUHK; Hao Yuantao, Dean of School of Public Health and Professor of Medical Statistics and Epidemiology.
2月16日，中国疾控中心首任主任李立明率中华预防医学会新型冠状病毒感染肺炎防控专家组在北京接受《中国新闻周刊》专访。
On February 16, Li Liming, the first director of the China CDC, gave an interview to the China News Weekly in Beijing with the Chinese Society of Preventive Medicine's expert group on the prevention and control of coronavirus-infected pneumonia.
“这个监测系统并不负责发现新发传染病”《中国新闻周刊》：中国的疾控系统在SARS之后就建立了一个直报系统来进行传染病监测，但在这次疫情早期，这一防线好像并没有及时发挥作用，这可能是在监测的哪些环节出了问题？汪华：在SARS前，我们国家就开始建立一个敏感的、在全国能上下联动的疫情报告系统，SARS以后就加快了这个系统的建设。
"The surveillance system is not responsible for detecting new infectious diseases." China News Weekly: China's disease control system set up a direct reporting system to monitor infectious diseases after SARS. But in the early days of the epidemic, this line of defense didn't seem to work in time.
这个系统是由医疗机构和卫生机构集成的，甲类、乙类传染病，确诊以后在网上直接报告，丙类传染病只监测不报告。
The system is integrated by medical institutions and health institutions. Class A and B infectious diseases are reported directly on the Internet after diagnosis, and C infectious diseases are only monitored and not reported.
根据《传染病防治法》，只有国家卫生行政部门以及它委托的省级卫生行政机构才有权公布疫情，国家疾控中心与地方各级疾控中心都是没有任何权力对外公布疫情的。
According to the Communicable Diseases Act, only the national health administration and provincial health administrations entrusted by it are authorized to declare the epidemic, and neither the CDC nor the local CDC has any authority to disclose the epidemic.
此外，一个重要问题是，新发传染病不在报告范围里面，也就是说，这个监测系统并不负责发现新发传染病。
In addition, an important issue is that newly emerging infectious diseases are not covered by the report, that is, the surveillance system is not responsible for detecting new infectious diseases.
《中国新闻周刊》：那么新发传染病如何监测和报告？ 汪华：对于公共卫生疑似突发事件，有另外一个报告系统。
CHINA NEWSWEEK: So how do you monitor and report new infectious diseases? Wang Hua: There is another reporting system for suspected public health emergencies.
这个系统规定了报告的数量、范围、时间，它是一个疑似病例，因此不对外公布，要通过专家评估、核实、诊断，最后确定是不是构成突发公共卫生事件，这里就需要一定时间的过程。
The system defines the number, scope and timing of reports, which is a suspected case and is therefore not made public. It takes time to determine, through expert assessment, verification and diagnosis, whether or not it constitutes a public health emergency.
所以这就暴露了我们在制度与规范设计上存在的问题。
So this has exposed the problems we have in the design of institutions and norms.
李立明：在《传染病防治法》里，对这些新发传染病只有一句话，就是说要报告，但是对于怎么报告，没有明确的规定。
Li Liming: In the Infectious Diseases Act, there is only one sentence for these newly emerging infectious diseases, that is to say, to report, but there is no clear rule on how to report them.
所以在1月20日左右，国家规定新冠病毒肺炎为“乙类传染病，按甲类管理”，其后每天就开始报告了。
So around January 20, the state designated pneumonia as a "Class B infectious disease, managed according to category A," and has reported it every day since.
在这之前，没有定性它是一个什么病、危害性如何，需要有一个专家评估与卫生行政部门决策的过程。
Prior to this, it was not determined what the disease was and what the harm was, and an expert evaluation of the decision-making process with the health administration was required.
姜庆五：全世界恐怕也难以找到中国的这么一个强大的疫情直报系统，它对已知传染病的管理，还是发挥了很大作用，它的缺点是，没有覆盖新发传染病。
Jiang Qinwu: The world may also find it difficult to find such a strong disease reporting system in China, it has played a great role in the management of known infectious diseases, its shortcoming is that it does not cover new infectious diseases.
对于怎么改进它，我的建议是，对于一个新发传染病，要加强“症状监测”，而不是“疾病监测”。
My advice on how to improve it is to strengthen "symptom surveillance" rather than "disease surveillance" for a newly emerging infectious disease.
因为一开始，一个新的疾病出现，谁也不知道它是什么病，但往往它的表现不外乎发热、咳嗽、腹泻、呕吐、肌肉酸痛等，这些都是很敏感的证据，需要把这些症状检测起来。
Because at first, a new disease appears, and no one knows what it is, but often it behaves like fever, cough, diarrhea, vomiting, muscle aches, etc., all sensitive evidence that needs to be detected.
李立明：此次新冠疫情爆发的这个时间，正好是我们的流感、肺炎或过去所谓的非典型性肺炎季，也是很多呼吸道传染病高发的季节。
Li Liming: The outbreak of the new crown coincided with our flu, pneumonia or what used to be called the SARS season. It was also the season for many respiratory infections.
因此，在短期内要发现一个呼吸道传染病是一个新发疾病，还是需要一定时间和检测来确定的。
Therefore, in the short term, to find a respiratory infectious disease is a new disease, or it will take time and testing to determine.
我们最近准备给政府提议，对于呼吸道传染病，能够有一个专门的、敏感的监测系统，凡是有相关症状的，全部上报，再从里面筛选出哪些是新发传染病、哪些是已有传染病。
We recently intend to propose to the Government that there should be a special, sensitive surveillance system for respiratory infectious diseases and that all cases of related symptoms be reported, and that new and existing infectious diseases be screened out.
汪华：目前，发热门诊、不明原因肺炎的监测系统以及流感监测系统，都分散在医疗机构的管理单项里。
Wang Hua: At present, the fever clinic, the surveillance system of unknown pneumonia and the influenza surveillance system are all scattered in the management items of medical institutions.
在就诊过程中，发现不明原因肺炎病人，按要求本应立即报告，但实际操作中没人管。
In the course of the visit, patients with pneumonia of unknown cause were found and should have been reported immediately as required, but no one took care of them in practice.
临床医生都很忙，上报就意味着后续有一系列登记填表、调查的工作要做，这对于他们来说，是额外的负担。
Clinicians are busy, and reporting means there is a subsequent series of registration forms and investigations, which is an additional burden on them.
所以专家们早就提出来，要在机制上打通诊断、报告、治疗和疫情控制。
So experts have long argued for a mechanism to unlock diagnosis, reporting, treatment, and epidemic control.
具体来说，比如，能否在医院的电子诊疗系统做一个改进，当医生接诊一个不明原因肺炎病人，不需要再另填表，只需在他的系统里点击按钮，这个病例就能发送到监测系统里去。
Specifically, for example, could an improvement be made to the hospital's electronic diagnostic system so that when a doctor visits a patient with pneumonia due to unknown causes, there is no need to fill out another form. Instead, the case can be sent to the monitoring system by clicking a button in his system.
“第一时间需要流行病学家”《中国新闻周刊》：疫情初期，新冠肺炎的确诊标准包含了必须要有华南海鲜市场接触史、发热等条件，但并不是每个病人都能同时满足这些条件。
"First Need Epidemiologist" China News Weekly: In the early stages of the outbreak, the criteria for identifying new crown pneumonia included the need for a history of exposure to the South China seafood market, fever, etc., but not all patients were able to meet these conditions at the same time.
这就造成一个问题，医院收了很多疑似病人，但因不符合确诊条件，不能上报。
This creates a problem, as the hospital has received a large number of suspected patients who cannot be reported because they do not meet the conditions for diagnosis.
这反映出什么问题？李立明：新发传染病有一个很大的特点，就是一定要考虑它的流行病学史，感染者有没有暴露在一个特定环境下，比如说，海鲜市场的野生动物销售环境。
Li Liming: One of the big characteristics of new infectious diseases is that they must take into account their epidemiological history and whether the infected person is exposed to a particular environment, for example, the wildlife marketing environment in the seafood market.
确定了海鲜市场的流行病学特征以后，凡是和这个环境接触的，马上可以做出诊断，但并非所有从海鲜市场出来的都感染，反之亦然。
Having identified the epidemiological characteristics of seafood markets, those in contact with this environment can be immediately diagnosed, but not all those coming out of seafood markets are infected, and vice versa.
这就出现了一个诊断上的敏感性问题。
This raises a question of diagnostic sensitivity.
一般来说，面对一个新发传染病，为了发现和控制传染源，“宁可错杀一千，也不漏掉一个”，是应对的原则。
Generally speaking, in the face of a new infectious disease, in order to detect and control the source of infection, "would rather kill a thousand mistakes, not miss one", is the principle of response.
所以，应该强调的是，诊断方法的灵敏度要高一些，临床诊断标准可能应该宽一点，以保证不漏掉任何一个可疑的传染源。
Therefore, it should be emphasized that the diagnostic method should be more sensitive and the clinical criteria should be wider to ensure that no suspected source of infection is left out.
《中国新闻周刊》：最早确定诊断标准的时候，有没有流行病学专家？姜庆五：从结果来看，当时，病原学以外的事情没有刻画出来。
Is there an epidemiologist when China News Weekly: When the first diagnostic criteria were determined? Jiang Qingv: From the results, things other than etiology were not portrayed at the time.
在12月31日国家卫健委第一批专家组去武汉后，没有看到有流行病学或公共卫生学专家出来发声。
After the first group of experts from the National Fitness and Health Commission visited Wuhan on 31 December, no epidemiological or public health experts were seen to speak out.
一个新疾病的出现，当然要让科学家来研究，而且当时也有很多混在一起的相似传染病，找出病原非常重要。
The emergence of a new disease, of course, had to be studied by scientists, and there were many similar infectious diseases mixed together, and it was important to find the cause.
但是，我们也体会到了最初的调查中，流行病学调查的跟进不足，比如，只看到华南海鲜市场，但是，当时有一部分病人并非从海鲜市场获得感染。
However, we also experienced a lack of follow-up from the initial epidemiological investigation, for example, only the South China seafood market was observed, but some patients did not get the infection from the seafood market at the time.
光看了几个病人，刻画不出这个疾病背后真正的传播规律，病人是从什么地方来的、感染源是什么地方、传染途径又是什么等等。
Looking at a few patients does not reveal the true pattern of transmission behind the disease, where the patient comes from, where the source of infection is, what is the route of transmission, etc.
李立明：其实，新发传染病的应对要做的就三件事：控制传染源、切断传播途径和保护易感人群。
Li Liming: Actually, there are only three things to be done to deal with new infectious diseases: controlling the source of infection, cutting off transmission routes and protecting vulnerable populations.
所以，一个新发传染病从一开始就要着手关注这三件事。
So an emerging infectious disease starts by focusing on these three things.
疾控专家就是要寻找新发传染病的流行病学规律，找出它可疑的传染源、疾病的潜伏期、疾病特征和发病规律等，以便及时采取防控措施；临床大夫主要关注临床症状、体征、诊断标准、治疗和它的预后等，以提高治愈率和减少病死率；基础研究专家关注病原及其特征，发现病毒的全基因测序及结构特征后，就可以研制诊断试剂、疫苗和治疗的药物。
CDC specialists look for epidemiological patterns of new infectious diseases, identify their suspected sources of infection, incubation period, disease characteristics and morbidity patterns, so that preventive measures can be taken in a timely manner. Clinicians focus on clinical symptoms, signs, diagnostic criteria, treatments and their prognosis.
这三项工作相互配合，缺一不可。
All three work together and are indispensable.
但是，在新发传染病早期暴发或流行时，在我们不知道病原为何物时，一个传染病同样可以有效的预防和控制，这是我们公众要建立的一个概念，不是说非得找到病原，才能控制疫情。
But when new infectious diseases erupt early or become epidemic, when we do not know what the cause is, an infectious disease can also be effectively prevented and controlled. This is a concept that we in the public want to build, not that we have to find a pathogen to control the outbreak.
同时，对于临床大夫的早期诊断和各种新发传染病的临床鉴别能力的培训，以及传染病防护技能的培训，其实也是非常重要的。
At the same time, training for clinicians in early diagnosis and clinical diagnosis of emerging infectious diseases, as well as training in infectious disease prevention techniques, is also important.
《中国新闻周刊》：也就是说，即使病原不清楚，事实上也是可以启动预防措施。
China News Weekly: In other words, even if the cause of the disease is not clear, preventive measures can actually be initiated.
但中国的现实情况是，临床医生更为强势，那么流行病学家能在何时、以何种方式介入？李立明：举一个例子，美国在每个医院的急诊科里面都配有CDC的专家，他们就是要在急诊室随时发现新的异常病例，建立起一种敏感度很高的传染病疫情监测系统。
But the reality in China is that clinicians are more powerful, so when and how can epidemiologists get involved? Li Liming: For example, in the United States, emergency departments in every hospital are staffed with CDC specialists who are constantly finding new abnormal cases in emergency rooms and setting up a highly sensitive epidemiological surveillance system.
疾控专家与临床医生一起工作，这就叫医防结合。
CDC specialists work with clinicians, which is called the combination of medicine and defense.
而我们现在都是，临床大夫在一线往上报各种可疑的临床病例，然后流行病学的或疾控专家再去调查，这样做是不同步的，不利于及早发现新发传染病患者及可能的传染源。
And we're all here, clinicians are reporting suspicious clinical cases on the front lines, and then epidemiological or disease experts are investigating, which is out of sync with the early detection of new infectious diseases and possible sources of infection.
“拐点并不是黎明前的黑暗，只是相当于夜里12点”《中国新闻周刊》：现在大家都在说拐点，那么拐点真的已经到来了吗？陈峰：首先我们要厘清一下拐点的含义。
The inflection point is not the darkness before dawn, it is just the equivalent of 12 oclock in the night.Now everyone is talking about the inflection point, so has the inflection point really come? Chen Feng: First, let's clarify the meaning of the inflection point.
拐点实际上是新增发病率或发病人数最高的那一天，而且应该是按发病时间来计算，并非是往上报告的病例，因为上报的都是确诊病例数，往往滞后，因而我们看到的拐点，实际上是比实际情况滞后的。
The inflection point is actually the day when the highest number of new cases or cases occur, and it should be measured in terms of the time of onset, not as previously reported, because the number of confirmed cases reported tends to lag behind, so that the inflection point we see is actually lagging behind reality.
疾病本身有它的发展规律，如果不控制的话，它就呈指数级增长。
Diseases themselves have their own pattern of development, and if they are not controlled, they grow exponentially.
R0（基本传染数），是指一个人整个传染期里面能够感染多少人。
R0 (basic infections) refers to how many people a person can infect during the entire period of infection.
如果R0是2的话，那就已经很高了，防控就是要把这个R0指数给它降下来。
If the R0 is 2, it is already very high, the control is to give it the R0 index down.
所以，拐点实际上就是防控真正起作用的时候，也就是R0小于1的时候，这是我们从流行病学的角度来定义的拐点。
So the inflection point is actually when the control really works, that is, when R0 is less than 1, which is where we define the inflection point from an epidemiological point of view.
郝元涛：通过前期的一些数据分析，我们发现其实新发病例数的高峰时间，大概在1月26～29日这个时间范围内，之后新发病例数就开始缓慢下降。
Hao Yuan-tao: Through some data analysis in the early period, we found that the peak time of new cases is around January 26-29, after which the number of new cases begins to decline slowly.
这个跟公众每天看到的确诊病例数的高峰，刚好有一个错峰，因为发病了不一定马上确诊，这个时间差刚好也跟从发病到确诊的时间间隔比较一致。
The peak in the number of confirmed cases seen daily by the public coincides with a staggered peak, as the onset of the disease is not always immediately confirmed, and the time lag coincides with the interval between onset and diagnosis.
姜庆五：从分析结果发现，现在看到的高峰，是封城以后带来的效应，如果不采取封城，拐点可能还不会到，现在可能还是另外一种局面。
Jiang Qinghu: From the analysis results, it is found that the peak is now seen after the closure of the city, if not, the inflection point may not have arrived, may now be another situation.
拐点和封城的时间，从流行病学上来说是吻合的。
The timing of the inflection point and closure is epidemiological.
唐金陵：为什么说跟封城是吻合的？因为封城是1月23日，潜伏期平均是6天，也就是说，如果封城有效，那么到了1月29日以后，新发病例数就应该下滑。
Tang Jinling: Why is it consistent with the closure of the city? Because the city is closed on January 23 and the incubation period averages six days. That is, if the city is closed, the number of new cases should fall after January 29.
但是大家看到卫健委报的数，大概平均又晚5天左右，因此从封城到开始下降，应该在10天到12天左右。
But you see the number of Wei Jianghuang newspaper, about five days later on average, so from the closure to the beginning of the decline, should be about 10 days to 12 days.
果不其然，公开的数据就是在2月5日开始降的。
To be sure, the public figures began to fall on February 5.
我们刚才所说的拐点是发病高峰，也就是1月26日～29日，但拐点并不是黎明前的黑暗，只是相当于夜里12点，我们还有很长的路要走。
The inflection point we have just mentioned is the peak of the illness, that is, January 26-29, but the inflection point is not the darkness before dawn, but the equivalent of 12 at night, we still have a long way to go.
这个时候恰恰是临床上最艰难的时候。
This is precisely the most difficult time in clinical history.
因为这个病的治愈时间很长，就像蓄水池一样，进来的水很多，出去的很慢，造成了累计病例数很多的现象。
Because the disease takes a long time to heal, like a cistern, the water comes in a lot and goes out slowly, resulting in a large number of cumulative cases.
“很多地方卫健委一把手、二把手没有医学背景，也没有公共卫生背景”《中国新闻周刊》：长期以来，公卫界是不是在话语权上比较弱势？李立明：平时突发应急的准备，疾控系统天天都在做，但是没有得到足够的认识和重视。
"Many local health officials have no medical background, no public health background" China News Weekly said: For a long time, the public defenders are relatively weak in their voice? Li Liming: In peacetime, emergency preparedness, disease control system is done every day, but not enough awareness and attention.
往往是疫情来了，疾控机构和队伍就被重视了，而疫情一走，这支队伍就不被重视了，甚至被边缘化了。
Often the outbreak comes and disease control agencies and teams are valued, and once the epidemic is over, the team is undervalued or even marginalized.
我们常调侃说，预防医学、公共卫生实际上是一个“自毁长城”的队伍，你的防病工作做得越好，就越得不到社会和政府部门的重视。
We often make fun of the fact that preventive medicine, public health is actually a "self-destructive" team, and the better you do, the less attention you get from society and government.
这种状况必须改变！郝元涛：怎样培养一支优秀的公共卫生与预防医学队伍，是大家很关注的，但是现在的形势确实很严峻。
Hao Yuan-tao: How to train a good team of public health and preventive medicine is a great concern, but the situation is very serious indeed.
从入口来说，现在第一志愿报考预防医学专业的同学，就算在我们这些优秀的公共卫生学院里，所占比例大概也就不超过30%～40%，有不少都是通过调剂过来的。
From the entrance point, now the first volunteer students in preventive medicine, even in our excellent public health colleges, the proportion of about 30% to 40%, many through transfers.
我觉得至少有两个原因，一是国家对公卫机构的重视不够，它的地位不高；二是大家对公卫的重要性认识不清楚。
I think there are at least two reasons for this: the insufficient attention paid by the State to public health institutions and their low status; and the lack of awareness of the importance of public health.
从出口来说，传统上，很多优秀的毕业生都到疾控中心去工作，但现在优秀毕业生不选择去疾控中心，而是情愿到医院工作在医院里做院内感染工作、科研工作，或者去一些相关的辅助科室，因为相比较医院来说，疾控的待遇差，而医院的待遇好很多。
In terms of exports, many of the best graduates have traditionally gone to CDC, but now, instead of going to CDC, top graduates prefer to work in hospitals doing nosocomial infections, doing scientific research, or going to related auxiliary departments, because the disease is poorly treated compared to hospitals, where they are treated much better.
其实这都值得我们深思，而且要想到办法解决这个问题。
In fact, this is worth thinking about, and we have to find a solution to this problem.
否则将来大楼有了、机制建立起来了，但是没有一支优秀的疾控队伍，还是很难做好这件事情的。
Otherwise in the future the building has a mechanism to build up, but without a good disease control team, it is difficult to do this thing well.
陈峰：临床医学专业、口腔医学，都有专业博士学位的授权点，只有公共卫生没有专业博士。
Chen Feng: Clinical medicine, stomatology, have the authorized point of professional doctorate, only public health has no professional doctorate.
我们几个学校已经申请了很多年，但一直没有批下来。
Several of our schools have applied for many years, but they have not been approved.
公共卫生专业最高的学位就是硕士。
The highest degree in public health is a master's degree.
这一点也体现了教育、行政各方面的不重视。
This is also reflected in the education, administrative aspects of the lack of attention.
《中国新闻周刊》：在美国的教育体系中，公共卫生硕士（MPH）是最高学位吗？李立明：美国还有公共卫生博士学位。
China News Weekly: Is the Master of Public Health (MPH) the highest degree in the American educational system? Li Liming: The United States also has a doctorate in public health.
此外，美国所有的州卫生局局长一般都是医学博士（MD）加公共卫生硕士（MPH），这是卫生管理最佳的学历背景。
In addition, all state health chiefs in the United States are generally doctors of medicine (MD) plus masters in public health (MPH), the best academic background in health management.
据我了解，美国医学院校里的医学博士（MD）中约有四分之一拥有MPH学位，体现了对公共卫生专业的重视和在美国卫生保健系统中的地位和作用，公共卫生专业其实是一个比较普及的职业教育。
As far as I know, about a quarter of MD's in American medical schools have MPH degrees, reflecting the importance attached to the public health profession and its place and role in the American health-care system, which is in fact a fairly universal vocational education.
姜庆五：这次疫情里，现场处理了好多干部。
Jiang Qingwu: During this epidemic, many cadres were handled on the spot.
其实在很多地方，卫健委的一把手、二把手都没有医学背景，也没有公共卫生教育背景，这是我很吃惊的，因为这是一个需要强有力的专业知识支撑的岗位。
In fact, in many places, the first and second-in-command of the health care committee have no medical background, public health education background, which is very surprising, because this is a position that needs strong professional knowledge.
湖北疫情早期的各种问题，都与这种“不是专业的人却在做专业的事”的现象有一定关系。
Hubei epidemic in the early days of the various problems, and this "non-professional people are doing professional things" phenomenon has some relevance.
郝元涛：最早接触病人的是临床医生，但医生不仅仅要有个体防治的知识技能，应该还要有一个更高层面的群体防控的理念。
Hao Yuan-tao: It was the clinician who first came into contact with the patients, but the doctors should not only have the knowledge and skills of individual control, but also have a higher concept of group control.
这就需要对医生有毕业后的继续教育，特别是关于公共卫生的教育。
This requires continuing post-graduation education for doctors, especially on public health.
“疾控要像消防一样，在疫情处置中有决定权、处置权”《中国新闻周刊》：现在有一种普遍的探讨，比如说把中国疾控中心（CDC）和美国的相比，发现后者有很强的决策权。
"CDC has the right to make decisions and dispose of the epidemic as if it were a fire brigade." China News Weekly: There is now a widespread discussion, for example, comparing China's CDC with that of the United States, which has strong decision-making power.
现行体制对于疾控工作来说，会带来怎样的影响？汪华：这跟中国卫生健康的指导思想有关系、和体制有关系。
What is the impact of the current system on disease control? Wang Hua: It has something to do with the guiding ideology of China's health and the system.
当然不能简单跟美国CDC比，这是两个本质不同的系统。
Of course, it's not easy to compare with the U. S. CDC. These are two fundamentally different systems.
我当疾控中心主任这么多年，也到行政部门工作了很多年，极力在为疾控机构呐喊，但我们只能在国家的大框架下做力所能及的事情。
After all these years as CDC director and many years in the administration, I've been campaigning for the CDC, but we can only do what we can within the broad framework of the country.
疾控中心是一类公益事业单位，它的定位就是一个技术指导部门。
CDC is a kind of public welfare institution, its positioning is a technical guidance department.
所以包括国家CDC主任在内，哪有权力来公布疫情相关的东西？不可能的。
So who, including the head of the National CDC, has the power to publicize what is relevant to the epidemic? It is impossible.
体制上怎么改进，我们的想法就是，一定要给它行政权力。
The idea of how to improve the system is to give it executive power.
就像消防一样，在疫情的处置中，有自己的决定权、处置权。
Like fire fighting, in the disposal of epidemic situation, have their own decision-making power, discretion.
李立明：不可能在高楼救火的时候，我开着车到那一看，先请示上级说我们有什么方案，等上级批了我们再去救火吧？！汪华：现在大家都在怪CDC，实际上它没有任何权力。
Li Liming: It's impossible to fire in a high-rise building when I drive there, first ask our superiors to tell us what plan we have, wait for the higher-level approval before we go out to fight the fireWanghua: Now everyone is blaming CDC, but actually it has no power.
我们开玩笑说，还不如回到原来防疫站的体制，那时候监督和监测职能放在一起。
We joked that it would be better to go back to the old quarantine system, when the surveillance and monitoring functions were put together.
现在行政管理权没有了，什么事情都要看同级的卫生行政部门怎么决策。
Now that the administration is gone, everything depends on how the health authorities at the same level make decisions.
就好像疫苗一出事，要追责即先把疾控中心主任撤掉，这是毫无道理的。
There is no reason why the CDC director should be removed as soon as something goes wrong with the vaccine.
任军：预防为主的理念要长期坚持下去，不能因为一场传染病疫情处理好了，就放松了。
Ren Jun: The concept of prevention-based to stick to the long-term, not because a good epidemic of infectious diseases, relax.
事实上，2003年以后，国家对各层级疾控体系的建设是非常重视的，房屋的建造、人才的培养，进步很快。
In fact, after 2003, the state attached great importance to the construction of disease control system at all levels.
可是过了10年以后，慢慢就走下坡路了，预防为主的理念又松了。
But after 10 years, slowly going downhill, the concept of prevention-based again relaxed.
此外，我们很好的传统不能轻易放弃。
Moreover, our fine traditions cannot be given up easily.
比如说SARS以后，原卫生部有一个40号部长令，对疾控体系怎么建设有清晰的规划，但是实行一段时间后，就执行不下去了。
After SARS, for example, the former Ministry of Health had a 40-ministerial decree with a clear plan for how the disease control system would be built, but after a period of implementation, it could not go ahead.
比如，过去有一条规定是，疾控单位的一把手，必须是公共卫生专业本科毕业以上的专业人才。
For example, there used to be a rule that the chief of a disease control unit must be a professional with at least an undergraduate degree in public health.
但现在好像又没有坚持这个规定了。
But I don't seem to be sticking to that rule anymore.
《中国新闻周刊》：具体来说，将来疾控改革的方向是什么？李立明：我们希望可以参考现在的中医药管理局与药监局，将来中国疾控中心应当归国务院直属管理，建成一个具有行政管理和专业技术支撑的国家疾控管理局，进一步加强疾控部门在处理公共卫生事务中的角色与职能。
In the future, the CDC should be under the management of the State Council, and a CDC will be established under the State Council to further strengthen the role and functions of the CDC in handling public health affairs.
