本报记者 李静 湖北广水报道一天之内隔离50人，这对于广水市第一人民医院院办主任刘学方来说，还不是问题的全部。
Our reporter Li Jing Hubei Guangshui reports that 50 people are isolated in one day, which is not the whole issue for Liu Xuefang, director of the First People's Hospital of Guangshui City.
更关键的问题是，还有疑似病例需要陆续确认。
More critically, there are suspected cases that need to be identified.
这里是广水，距离新型冠状病毒感染肺炎旋涡的中心武汉140公里。
Here is Guangshui, 140 kilometers from the center of the new coronavirus infection pneumonia vortex.
对于这座城市的医疗防疫系统而言，这是一次巨大的考验。
It was a huge test for the city's health-care system.
因为春节假期的原因，在武汉务工上学的人流回到广水，这让广水这座小城，面临巨大的防控压力。
Because of the spring festival holiday, the flow of workers back to Guangshui in Wuhan, so that the small city of Guangshui, faced with tremendous pressure to prevent and control.
在除夕夜，一位疑似患者转院来到广水市第一人民医院就医，接诊护士没有防护服，只戴了一个口罩接诊。
On New Year's Eve, a suspected patient was transferred to Guangzhou First People's Hospital for medical treatment. The attending nurse had no protective clothing and was treated only by a mask.
而据广水第一人民医院的医生反映，如果按照规定使用口罩，年前发给护士的合格口罩，只够用一两天。
According to doctors at the Guangshui First People's Hospital, only a day or two of qualified masks could be given to nurses if masks were used as required.
1月25日（农历大年初一）湖北省广水市第一人民医院的医护人员发出防护物资求助，寻求捐赠N95口罩、防护服、护目镜。
On January 25 (the first day of the Lunar New Year), medical staff of the First People's Hospital in Guangshui City, Hubei Province, issued protective materials for help and sought donations of N95 masks, protective clothing and goggles.
考验，对于这座小城来说，开始了。
The test, for the little town, begins.
等待救助还是主动求助？来自医护人员的求助称：医护人员装备严重不足，市里和院里都在加急购买，国家也在紧急调配，在这方面我们缺的是物资生产出来的时间。
Medical staff are severely under-equipped, emergency purchases are being made both in the city and in the courtyard, and the state is in a state of emergency, according to medical staff.
对外开放官方接受捐赠渠道这个事情已经向领导反映了，在等领导安排。
Opening up to the outside world Official acceptance of the donation channel has been reflected to the leadership, waiting for the leadership arrangements.
采访对象供图“我们现在戴的口罩还是很早以前自己买的口罩，而且都不是医用口罩。
Photo: "The masks we're wearing are the same ones we bought a long time ago, and they're not medical masks.
年前我们科室每个人就发了一包一次性医用口罩，一包只有十个，按规定四个小时换一个，只够用一两天。
A few years ago, everyone in our department issued a package of disposable medical masks, only ten in a bag, one for every four hours, only enough for a day or two.
”一名广水市第一人民医院的医护工作人员告诉《中国经营报》记者，“现在的物资都在感染科。
"All the supplies are in the infection department," a medical worker at the Guangzhou First People's Hospital told China Operator.
我们一名急诊科护士说，昨天晚上（除夕夜）从马坪镇转来一个发烧的疑似病人，接诊护士连起码的防护措施都没有，只有一个口罩。
One of our emergency nurses said last night (New Year's Eve) a suspected feverish patient from Ma Ping Township had no minimal protective measures, only a mask.
”采访对象供图“我们现在有防护服的只有内四科感染科。
2007-9-24 16: 48 "The only ones we have now are the Interior Four Infection Units.
”上述医护工作人员透露。
The medical staff said.
据了解，门诊和急诊医护人员都缺防护物资，因为医院人员不足，晚上9点以后开展不了发热门诊（即内四科感染科），晚上所有的发热病人均在急诊科就诊。
It is understood that there is a shortage of protective materials for out-patient and emergency medical staff, as hospitals are understaffed and there is no fever clinic after 9 p.m. (i.e., in-house four infection units), and all febrile patients are treated in the emergency department at night.
“三十（除夕夜）的晚上，急诊科的门口还排很长的队。
On New Year's Eve there was a long line at the door of the emergency department.
”从武汉返乡的郑思思（化名）曾在1月21日前往广水市第一人民医院发热门诊就诊，据郑思思回忆：“两点钟医生开始上班，只有一个医生，就戴了一个N95口罩，没有护目镜，穿的是白大褂，没有防护服。
"The doctor started work at two o'clock. There was only one doctor and he wore a N95 mask, no goggles, white coats and no protective clothing.
”虽然广水市有4家发热定点医院，包括广水市第一人民医院、广水市第二人民医院、广水市中医医院、广水市妇幼保健院，但大部分的患者涌往广水市第一人民医院和广水市第二人民医院。
Although there are four hospitals designated for fever in Guangzhou, including the First People's Hospital in Guangshui City, the Second People's Hospital in Guangshui City, the Guangzhou Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital and the Guangshui Municipal Maternal and Child Health Center, most of the patients flocked to the First People's Hospital in Guangzhou City and the Second People's Hospital in Guangshui City.
有接近广水市第二人民医院的人士告诉记者，目前广水市第二人民医院也缺各种医疗物资。
People close to the Second People's Hospital in Guangzhou told reporters that the Second People's Hospital in Guangshui is short of all kinds of medical materials.
“紧缺N95口罩、防护服、护目镜。
"There is a shortage of N95 masks, protective clothing and goggles.
现在能保证一线的医生有防护措施，但是我们马上面临更大的紧缺。
There is a guarantee that front-line doctors will have protection in place, but we are facing an even greater shortage right now.
今天隔离了50人，马上启动分部，设60张病床，现在病房已经腾空，人员马上上去，之后会接受更多的病人，这样缺口就大了。
Today, 50 people are being quarantined, and the 60-bed section will be activated immediately. Now that the ward has been vacated, the staff will go up immediately, and more patients will be admitted, leaving a large gap.
”刘方学表示：除了发热门诊，其他科室的防护服、N95口罩确实短缺。
Besides the fever clinic, there is a real shortage of protective clothing and N95 masks in other departments, Liu said.
现在市里正在开会紧急研究方案。
The city is now meeting for an emergency research program.
”今天上午有武大校友会相关联络人员尝试联系广水市第一人民医院相关工作人员，统计医院物资缺口，然后把武大校友会接收到的捐赠物资捐往有需要的医院。
"This morning, the relevant liaison staff of the alumni association tried to contact the relevant staff of the First People's Hospital of Guangshui City to work out the material gap and then donate the donations received by the alumni association to hospitals in need.
不过进展并不顺利。
However, progress has not been smooth.
武大校友会相关联络人员透露：“他们的口径不一致，不肯透露情况。
"Their voices are not consistent and they refuse to disclose information," said the university's alumni association.
可能接到行政命令，设备科吞吞吐吐说‘我们不缺’，有什么事情跟医院联系。
There may be an executive order, and the Equipment Section stammers, 'We're not short of', what's the matter with the hospital?
联系医院值班的人说很缺，向领导汇报了。
Contact the hospital duty person said very short, reported to the leader.
”对于武大校友会相关联络人员统计医院物资缺口的行为，广水市有关部门负责人反问：“统计干什么？你们有吗？全国都紧张，国资委不是在全国调配？”广水市隶属随州市代管，根据随州市政府部门公布的最新数据，全市截至2020年1月24日，累计收治疑似病例62例，其中新增20例，确诊5例。
As for the behavior of the relevant liaison staff of WU Alumni Association to count the shortage of materials in hospitals, the head of the relevant department in Guangshui asked: "What are the statistics? Do you have any?
未公布确诊案例属于哪个区、市。
The district or municipality to which the confirmed case belongs has not been announced.
1月24日24时起随州市区封城，1月25日广水市宣布即日起封城，出租车限时营运、定点消毒，其他各类公共交通暂停营运，广水火车站进口通道临时封闭。

Donating Materials Difficulty After City Hospital or medical staff issued material donation channels or help information, many caring people participated in the sharing of information, the collection of supplies and a relay of donations.
1月24日晚，湖北省女企业家协会成员寻找到一次性医用口罩资源，并以个人名义募资购买捐赠给湖北省三四线城市医疗资源紧缺的医院，截至1月25日有8家医院对接寻求捐赠，发出的需求超过65000只口罩。
On the night of January 24, members of the Association of Women Entrepreneurs of Hubei Province found disposable medical mask resources and raised funds in their own names to purchase hospitals donated to hospitals with scarce medical resources in the third and fourth-tier cities of Hubei Province.
（8家医院分别为：黄梅县人民医院、蕲春县人民医院、黄冈市中心医院、黄冈市蕲春县刘河镇卫生院、罗田县中医院、咸宁第一人民医院、红安县人民医院、阳新县人民医院）1月25日下午，潜江医院派出车辆前往口罩厂商处，准备把货运往对接好的8家医院，但截至记者发稿，口罩仍然停留在位于湖北仙桃的生产厂商仓库中。
On the afternoon of January 25, the Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Court of Huangmei County People's Hospital, the Agkistrodon Agkistrodon City Central Hospital, the Luotian County Chinese Hospital, the Xianning First People's Hospital, the Hongan County People's Hospital and the Yangxin County People's Hospital.
“潜江医院今天派车到仙桃拖货，但是进不去。
"The Qianjiang Hospital sent a car to Xiantao tow today, but couldn't get in.
装了货的可以证明是防护物资，空车怎么进去还没有说法。

”有接近人士告诉记者。

顺丰速运、京东快递正在积极参与医疗物资的配送。
Shun Fengyun, Jingdong Express is actively participating in the distribution of medical supplies.
“我们也在给医院还有一线记者送物资，进城需要批文，而且很多路被堵死，特别费劲。
"We're delivering supplies to hospitals and front-line journalists, we need permits to get into town and a lot of roads are blocked," he said.
”京东相关人员表示，“今天京东物流公布的义务支持信息电话已经接爆了。
"The voluntary support call announced by Jingdong Logistics has exploded today," officials said.
”运输资源有限的情况之下，京东快递、顺丰速运均优先处理机构组织的需求。
With limited transport resources, Jing Dong Express and Shun Fenghao are giving priority to organizational needs.

"We have got the money, and we must hurry with the supplies to the hospital.
”爱心人士熙雅筹集到了一笔钱，但却买不到医疗物资。
Loving personage Xia raised a sum of money but was unable to buy medical supplies.
武大校友会除了接受医疗物资之外，还接受来自爱心人士的捐款，由专业人士统一采购符合医疗标准需求的医疗物资，1月25日开始统计湖北省各地市医院缺口数据，之后再安排物流统一配送，但目前武大校友会也遇到采购难题。
Apart from receiving medical supplies, the alumni association also receives donations from loving people to purchase medical materials in line with medical standards. On January 25, the Association began to count the shortage data of hospitals in various cities and provinces of Hubei Province.
据不完全统计，目前武汉周边已有十几个地级市、县级市的医院发出医疗资源捐赠求助。
According to incomplete statistics, Wuhan has a dozen hospitals around the city, county-level hospital issued medical resources for help.
截至记者发稿，广水市公布的4家发热定点医院没有发出官方捐赠消息。
As of the press release, Guangshui City announced that the 4 fever designated hospitals did not send the official donation message.
广水市第一人民医院医护人员发出防护物资求助之后，记者再度联系武大校友会相关联络人员却被告知：“暂时顾不上了，其他省份在跟我们抢物资，要求本省工厂生产的产品供应本省。
"For the time being, other provinces are fighting with us to supply our province with products from factories," said the university alumni association's contact staff after the medical staff of the First People's Hospital of Guangzhou sent out protective materials for help.
现在都是自顾不暇。
It's too much to worry about now.
