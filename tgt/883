本报记者 陈雪波 卢志坤“这是我穿过最舒服、最好看的鞋子。
"This is the most comfortable and beautiful shoe I have ever worn.
我们隔离病毒但不隔离爱，感恩有你们!”周玲1月29日下午在自己的微信朋友圈发了这样一段话，配图是一双黑色平底布鞋。
We isolate the virus but do not isolate love, thank you! "Zhou Ling January 29 afternoon in his micro-letter circle sent this paragraph, with a pair of black flat-soled cloth shoes.
这双鞋，武汉好心人采购来送到了她所在的酒店。
This pair of shoes, Wuhan good people to buy to send to her hotel.
新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情爆发后，湖北民族大学附属民大医院重症医学科的护士周玲主动报名从恩施前往武汉金银潭医院，支援肺炎病人的救治工作。
After the outbreak of the new coronavirus infection pneumonia, Zhou Ling, a nurse in the department of severe medicine attached to the University of Hubei Nationalities University, volunteered to register at Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital to support the treatment of pneumonia patients.
周玲告诉《中国经营报》记者，“武汉的好心人很多，他们把我们照顾得特别好。
"There are a lot of good-hearted people in Wuhan and they take good care of us," Zhou Ling told China Business Daily.
”晚上值班同时护理8位肺炎患者周玲到了金银潭医院以后，被分到了“南6”科室，很快就投入了肺炎护理工作。
Zhou Ling, who was on duty at night caring for eight pneumonia patients, was assigned to the "South 6" department after arriving at the gold and silver pool hospital.
记者采访周玲前一晚，她值夜班，从下午5点进入医院，凌晨两点多才从医院出来。
Reporter interviewed Zhou Ling the night before, she was on night shift, from 5 p.m. into the hospital, more than 2 a.m. before leaving the hospital.
“上午睡了一觉醒来，双腿在打颤，脚缝有点疼，原来是脚趾起泡了。
"I woke up this morning with trembling legs and a little pain in the seams. It was foaming on my toes.
”晚上值班的八九个小时里，周玲需要同时护理8位肺炎患者。
Zhou Ling spent eight or nine hours on duty at night nursing eight patients with pneumonia.
“有两个‘高流量’的病人相对病症轻一点，只需要偶尔给他们一些帮助就行;三个‘无创’的病人要时刻注意他们的血氧饱和度等等几个指标;另外三个‘上下插管’的病人，就得随时观察他们的生命体征，要格外警惕。
"Two 'high-volume' patients were less likely to have symptoms and needed only occasional help; three 'non-invasive' patients had to keep an eye on their blood oxygen saturation, and three patients with 'upper and lower intubation' had to watch their vital signs from time to time.
这几个病人在不同的病房里，上班时间我就在一直不停地来回跑。
The patients were in different wards and I was running back and forth during office hours.
”周玲告诉记者，下班后休息过后，腿还是有点疼。
Zhou Ling told reporters that after the break, her leg still hurt a bit.
周玲在网上看到了一些对肺炎患者的报道，很是心疼。
Zhou Ling on the Internet to see some of the pneumonia patients reported, is very distressed.
“我在想，如果我做护理工作的时候再仔细一点，可能他们就能离死亡更远一些吧。
"I was thinking that if I had been more careful in my care work, they might have been further away from death.
”到金银潭医院第一天，医院特意为前来支援的医务人员安排了防护服使用的培训，这是医护人员与病毒“战斗”极其重要的一道防线。
On the first day of the hospital, support staff were trained in the use of protective clothing, a vital line of defence in the battle against the virus.
厚重密闭的防护服穿在身上并不轻松，“感觉很闷，喘不过来气”。
Heavy and closed protective clothing is not easy to wear on the body, "feel very stuffy, breathless."
从头“武装”到脚的防护装备上身，相互之间是认不出对方是谁的。
The body of the protective gear, armed from head to foot, is not recognizable to each other.
为了方便工作，大家会把自己的名字写在防护服的前胸、后背位置。
To make it easier to work, people write their names on the front and back of their suits.
医护人员在结束几个小时的“战斗”之后，口罩在他们脸上留下了深深的印痕，不少医护人员的脸上已经被磨破，周玲也不例外，鼻翼已经脱皮。
After hours of "fighting" by paramedics, the masks left deep marks on their faces, many of them worn out, and Zhou Ling was no exception, with her nose peeling.
她在朋友圈开玩笑：“鼻梁皮肤被压得松松垮垮的，都怪我妈把我生成一个‘高鼻梁’。
She joked in a circle of friends: "My mother was the one who turned me into a 'tall nose' because my nose was so crushed.
”来不及过多关注皮肤变化，借着下班休息的功夫，周玲和两位舍友都会学习一下近期需要用到的知识，关于仪器的、药物的。
Without much time to focus on skin changes, Zhou Ling and her two roommates would learn more about the equipment and drugs needed in the near future by taking a break from work.
周玲为自己学的CRRT(连续肾脏替代疗法)知识在护理中没用上很是懊恼，因为这次的仪器和原来使用过的不一样。
Zhou Ling regrets that her knowledge of CRRT (Continuous Renal Substitution Therapy) didn't work in nursing because the instrument was different from the one she had used before.
“还好有个小弟弟过来帮忙了。
"Fortunately, a little brother came to help.
”“有人说没有压力。
"" Some say there's no pressure.
压力肯定是有的，毕竟环境不熟悉，有的仪器也不熟悉。
There must be pressure, after all, the environment is not familiar, some instruments are not familiar.
但是小伙伴们能互相帮助，也有很厉害的教授在指导，就觉得工作还挺开心的。
But small partners can help each other, but there are also very strong professors in the guidance, feel that the work is quite happy.
”周玲表示。
Zhou Ling said.
一边在武汉救治病人，周玲也在关心原来工作单位(民大医院)的工作情况。
While treating patients in Wuhan, Zhou Ling is also concerned about the work of the original work unit (Min University Hospital).
“他们都叮嘱我要做好防护。
"They told me to take precautions.
其实我更担心他们，我在武汉这边的一线工作，毕竟防护设施是齐全的，不知道‘家里’现在的防护设施够不够。
In fact, I am more worried about them, I in Wuhan side of the frontline work, after all, the protection facilities are complete, do not know 'home' now enough protection facilities.
”得知原单位很多同事都主动报名去感染科支援，周玲觉得很感动。
"Zhou Ling was moved to learn that many of her colleagues had volunteered to sign up for infection support.
“我发朋友圈尽量搞笑一些，也是想让他们别担心我嘛。
"I tried to be funny in my circle of friends so they wouldn't worry about me.
”她告诉记者。
"she told reporters.
穿了防护服的周玲。
Zhou Ling in protective clothing.
受访者供图武汉的好心人送来了鞋子周玲告诉记者，医院的防护服十分宽松，鞋子不合适的话，容易踩到鞋套摔倒。
Interviewees for the good intentions of Wuhan sent shoes Zhou Ling told reporters that the hospital's protective clothing is very loose, shoes inappropriate words, easy to step on shoe cover fell.
“有两次差点摔倒，还好我扶住了墙。
"Twice I almost fell, but I held on to the wall.
”让周玲十分感动的是，武汉有一帮好心人在主动为医务人员做“后勤工作”。
Zhou Ling was very moved by the fact that Wuhan had a group of well-intentioned people who volunteered to do "logistics" for medical staff.
他们会买很多生活用品、水果送到支援医务人员所住的酒店。
They buy a lot of groceries and fruit and send them to the hotel where the paramedics stay.
有个叫华猛的好心人，得知周玲鞋子不合适，特意问好她尺码，跑去采购了平底布鞋送来。
A man named Hua Meng, knowing that Zhou Ling's shoes were not suitable, asked her for her size and ran to buy flat-bottomed cloth shoes.
穿这样的鞋不容易摔倒，脚也不容易磨出泡了。
Wear shoes like this do not fall easily, foot is not easy to wear bubble.
虽然周玲的腿还在疼，但至少接下来的工作时间里可以穿着合脚的布鞋去“跑病房”了。
Although Zhou Ling's leg is still painful, but at least for the rest of the working time can wear foot-fitting cloth shoes to "run the ward."
“我不爱去食堂吃饭，就吃志愿者送来的零食。
"I don't like to go to the cafeteria to eat snacks sent by volunteers.
”周玲很感谢武汉志愿者贴心周到的帮助。
Zhou Ling thanked the Wuhan volunteers for their thoughtful and thoughtful help.
她特意向家里讲了这边的人很热心，自己一切都挺好的。
She made a point of telling her family that the people here were warm-hearted and that everything was fine with her.
肺炎疫情刚刚出现的时候，周玲跟家里讲出门一定要戴口罩，家里起初并不在意。
Pneumonia just appeared, Zhou Ling told the family to go out must wear masks, the family did not care at first.
“我劝爸爸妈妈出门戴口罩，就像他们劝我穿秋裤一样难。
"I advised my parents to go out and wear masks just as hard as they advised me to wear autumn pants.
”但周玲踏上从恩施到武汉的火车以后，看着女儿的照片，妈妈还是哭了。
But when Zhou Ling set foot on the train from Enshi to Wuhan and looked at her daughter's picture, her mother still cried.
“妈妈告诉我要做好防护，吃得有营养些。
"Mother told me to take good care of myself and eat better.
”周玲朋友圈有一张鲜艳的月季花图片，是朋友发给她的，“我觉得是一种美好的期待吧”。
Zhou Ling's circle of friends has a bright picture of the rose, sent to her by friends, "I think it is a beautiful expectation."
周玲告诉记者，她会在武汉一直待到疫情结束。
Zhou Ling told reporters that she would stay in Wuhan until the end of the epidemic.
当被问及疫情结束，回到恩施以后第一件事想做什么，周玲说：“深吸一口不戴口罩的空气吧。
Asked what she wanted to do the first thing after returning to Enshi, Zhou Ling said: "Take a deep breath of air without a mask.
