[dvnewspage] http: / / www.youtheme.cn [/ color] [/ color] [/ color] [/ color] [color = Purple] http: / / www.51education.net [/ color] [/ color] [/ color] [/ color] [/ color]
《万箭穿心》改编自方方的同名小说，被公认为近年来最好的刻画武汉本土的电影，既展现了普世的人生之痛，又与武汉的城市文化生活血脉相连。
The novel, adapted from Fang Fang's eponymous novel, is widely regarded as the best depiction of Wuhan in recent years. It not only reveals the universal pain of life, but is also closely related to the cultural life of Wuhan.
年近八十的谢飞是中国第四代导演的代表人物，也是姜文最敬佩的三位导演之一——另外两个是谢晋和自己。
Nearly 80 years ago Xie Fei is the representative of China's fourth generation of directors, is one of Jiang Wen's most admired three directors - the other two are Xie Jin and himself.
关于国产电影，谢飞说过一些或许是电影人们想说而又不敢说的话。
With regard to domestic movies, Xie said something that people might have wanted to say but didn't dare to say.
“破电影管了60年了，越管越傻。
"It's been 60 years since the bad movie was made, the more stupid.
”这句话是去年说的。
"That's what I said last year.
还有一句：“我一直有个愿望，就是拍出有分量的关于动荡时期的作品，到现在我还没有。
Another sentence: "I have always had the desire to produce weighty work on turbulent times, and I still don't have one.
”谢飞师从谢晋，后者的代表作《芙蓉镇》正是其所指的那种“有分量的作品”。
"Xie Fei division from Xie Jin, the latter's masterpiece" Furong Town "is the kind of" weighty works.
谢飞说这句话是2003年，他在非典期间不幸感染，被安排在地坛医院治疗，出院后几个月参加一个访谈节目时说。
He said he was infected during SARS in 2003, was treated at Ditan Hospital and was released from hospital on an interview program a few months later.
那时“还没有”，17年过去了，他依旧没有实现愿望，如今退居二线，将精力投入提携新导演、寻找好剧本。
"Not yet," 17 years later, he still did not realize his aspirations, and is now on the back burner, devoting himself to bringing in new directors and finding good scripts.
最近，深居在家的谢飞用大把时间追剧，常常在微博上晒出自己的评分和影评，片单中有国产爆款剧《庆余年》也有好莱坞大片《小丑》。
Recently, Xie Feifei, who lives at home, has spent hours chasing after the drama, often drying his own ratings and reviews on microblogs, including the domestic hit "Year of the Year" and Hollywood blockbuster "The Joker."
他对韩国新片《南山的部长们》评价虽然不高，但一眼看到其光芒：韩国电影真是什么都敢拍！前几天，他翻出了当年报纸报道他出院的消息，在微博上感叹：十七年了，疫情又重演了。
He had a poor opinion of South Korea's new film, "Ministers of Nanshan," but at first glance saw its light: South Korean films are nothing but dares to shoot! The other day, he rummaged on microblogs that he had been discharged from the hospital 17 years ago.
2004年的一条新闻显示，谢飞正在筹备一部关于非典的电视剧，名字都取好了，叫《百日危机》。
In 2004, a news report showed that Xie Fei was preparing a TV series on SARS with the name "100 Days of Crisis."
谢飞说自己想表达的主题是：身染疾病并不可怕，精神上的病毒才是最致命的。
Xie said he wanted to express the theme: the disease is not terrible, mental virus is the most lethal.
但是后来没有了下文。
However, there was no follow-up.
不知这次他是否会重燃当年拍摄抗疫剧的念头，继《万箭穿心》之后再次跟方方合作。
I do not know whether this time he will rekindle the idea of filming the anti-epidemic drama, following the "ten thousand arrows through the heart" with Fang Fang again.
实际上，新冠抗疫剧的拍摄计划已经进入筹备阶段，编剧不是方方，是另一位女作家六六。
In fact, the production of the new crown anti-epidemic drama has entered the preparatory stage, the screenwriter is not Fang Fang, is another female writer.
不久前，耀客传媒官方微博发布消息称：首部全面反映抗疫题材电视剧启动，定名为《在一起》，指导精神和操作方式如下：创作阵容不可谓不强大。
Not long ago, the official Weibo news agency said: The first comprehensive reflection of the anti-epidemic drama started, named "Together," the guiding spirit and operational way: the creative lineup is not so strong.
这里面有两个名字可以具体说说：编剧六六和导演张黎。
There are two names that can be specified: screenwriter 6 6 and director Zhang Li.
他们各自的代表作、诞生于同一时期的《蜗居》和《大明王朝》，曾经都笼罩着“不可说”的意味，成为时代变革中言论尺度的风向标。
Their respective representative works, born in the same period of "Dwelling House" and "The Great Ming Dynasty," once shrouded in the meaning of "unspeakable," become the vane of the times in the transformation of the scale of speech.
最近热播剧《安家》的编剧是六六，几年前的医疗剧《心术》也出自她之手，所以由她来操刀“塑造抗疫一线可歌可泣的平民英雄群像”应该不成问题。
The screenwriter of the recent hit show "Settle down" is 66. She wrote The Heart, a medical drama a few years ago, so it should not be a problem for her to use her sword to "shape a legion of heroic folk heroes fighting the plague."
六六于3月8日抵达武汉之后，像方方一样在微信公众号更新日记，最近因为一句话激起众怒，她说：幸亏我来了，再不来素材都没了。
After arriving in Wuhan on March 8, she updated her diary like Fang Fang in the Weixin Public. Recently, she said, thanks to one sentence, she said, Thank God I am here.
“幸亏”和“素材”两个字刺痛了很多人。
The words "luckily" and "material" stung many people.
她在标题里使用了“我的责任”“视天下如己任”这样的大词，与方方的犀利追责不同，她日记里的“素材”充满温情，很多人留言提醒，“现在不需要唱赞歌的人”；质疑集中的另一方面是，她来时疫情已近尾声，对一个月前武汉人民经历的心碎并无切身体会，那些未经亲眼所见的对苦难的描写和对奉献的歌颂，会深刻吗？编剧六六的强项是都市家庭剧，导演张黎的专攻则是历史剧。
Unlike Fangfang's acerbic criticism, the "material" in her diary is full of tenderness, and many people leave a message saying, "There is no need to sing praises." The other side of the puzzle is that she came near the end of the epidemic and had no experience of the heartbreak Wuhan experienced a month ago.
张黎的两部神作《大明王朝》和《走向共和》在豆瓣均拿到9.7分，以此奠定“中国正剧第一导演”的地位。
Zhang Li's two masterpieces, "The Greater Ming Dynasty" and "Towards the Republic," both got 9.7 points in Doubane, thus establishing their status as "the first director of Chinese drama."
有人说《权力的游戏》在《大明王朝》面前只能叫“权力的斗殴”，有人说《大明王朝》“阐明了贪腐的制度肌理”，相比之下《人民的名义》只是皮毛。
Some say that "the game of power" can only be called "power struggle" in the face of "the Great Ming Dynasty," some say that "the Great Ming Dynasty" "elucidated the corruption of the institutional texture," in contrast to "the name of the people.
谁能想到，《大明王朝》也曾经是“命题作文”。
Who could have thought that "The Great Ming Dynasty" was also a "propositional composition".
据中国新闻网报道，2003年某位重要领导人到海南考察，对海南省领导表示：海南为什么不宣传海瑞呢？在历史上，海瑞因其刚正清廉的形象深入人心。
An important leader visited Hainan in 2003 and told Hainan's leaders: Why doesn't Hainan publicize Hainan Province? Historically, Hainan has gained popularity because of its reputation for honesty and uprightness.
这句话成为《大明王朝》创作的发端。
This sentence became the beginning of the creation of the "Ming Dynasty."
如果仔细看，每一集片尾处或许可以印证这一说法。
If you look closely, the end of each episode may confirm this statement.
据报道，当时主管部门采取了非常罕见的审查方式，广电总局“重大历史题材审查办”的领导和专家，每天以14集的速度审查，其中有70多岁的老人，每天坐十几个小时，3天半看完了46集。
It was reported that the authorities adopted a very rare form of censorship when leaders and experts from the State Administration of Radio, Television and Radio's Office of Major Historical Subjects examined 14 episodes a day, including 70-somethings who sat for more than a dozen hours a day and finished 46 episodes in three and a half days.
[1]顺利过审。
& # 91; 1 & # 93; A smooth trial.
然而，十几年前那个将“命题作文”写得非同凡响的张黎，最近给观众带来的是一部古偶剧，主演是毕业于解放军艺术学院的杨洋，评分不及《大明王朝》一半。
However, Zhang Li, who wrote the propositional composition so loudly more than a decade ago, recently brought a puppet show to the audience, starring Yang Yang, a graduate of the PLA Academy of Arts, with less than half the grade of "The Greater Ming Dynasty."
从写《蜗居》的六六到写《安家》的六六，从《大明王朝》的张黎到《武动乾坤》的张黎，人们应该对这部抗疫剧抱有什么样的期待？02.参考当年以非典为背景的影视作品，除了谢飞未能成行的《百日危机》，其实不在少数。
From the writing of "Dwelling House" to the sixth six, from Zhang Li of "The Great Ming Dynasty" to Zhang Li of "Wu Qiankun," what should people expect from this anti-epidemic drama?
当时最受关注的是《三十八度》，这是一部爱情电影，启用了当红影星黄磊和陶虹，分别扮演一个勤工俭学送外卖的研究生和一位年轻漂亮的空姐，因为非典封楼，两人被迫隔离在一起而演绎出的一段爱情故事。
The biggest attention at the time was "Thirty-eighth Degree," a love film starring the popular stars Huang Lei and Tao Hong, playing a graduate student and a beautiful young stewardess, respectively, who were forced to remain isolated as a result of the SARS blockade.
接到这个任务，两位演员都是零片酬出演。
The two actors were given zero pay for the task.
另一部展现抗疫情节的《惊心动魄》，属于那种“学校组织大家一起看的”电影，有人这样评论：“从制度到各行各业参与抗疫的人员，到各环节执行都是完美无缺的，只有理解和支持、配合，没有漏洞，也没有悲剧，自行体会吧。
Another "breathtaking" film, which shows the anti-epidemic festival, belongs to the kind of movie "Schools Organizing People to See Together." Some people say, "From the system to the people involved in fighting the epidemic, every link of the process is perfect.
”《惊心动魄》是八一电影制片厂出品的“三惊系列”之一，其他两部是《惊涛骇浪》和《惊天动地》，前者反映98抗洪，后者讲述汶川地震，与《惊心动魄》一样，可以说是中国式灾难纪实片的典型拍摄方式。
"Shocking" is one of the "three startling series" produced by the 81-movie studio, the other two being "The Storm Wave," which reflects the 98 flood response, and "Earthquake," which tells the story of the Wenchuan earthquake, which, like "Shocking Stars," is typical of Chinese disaster documentaries.
其他影视作品例如《非典人生》《21天》《没有硝烟的战争》等等，很少有人知道，可见这些作品的现实价值和艺术生命力非常有限。
Other films and TV productions, such as SARS Life, 21 Days of War without Smoke and so on, are rarely known to show their realistic value and artistic vitality.
只有凤凰卫视拍摄的5集纪录片《非典十年祭》在豆瓣上超过9分，在这次疫情中被很多人重新提起。
Only Phoenix TV's five-part documentary, Ten Years of SARS Sacrifice, scored more than nine points on the doughnut and was reintroduced by many during the outbreak.
拍不出好的作品或许是因为没有好的剧本。
You can't make a good work because there's no good script.
谢飞说，八九十年代是中国电影的黄金时代，那时候好的电影剧本很多都是来自好的文学作品，但是现在年轻人看文学的少了。
The '80s and' 90s were the golden age for Chinese movies, 'says Mr. Xie.' A lot of the good screenplays came from good literature, but now young people are less likely to see literature.
他还说，“伟大的作家和作品都是对生活有一定批判性的发现或者提出问题，对人类生存状态提出尖锐的质问，纯粹歌颂生活美和光荣面的东西有它的价值，但并不是太重要。
"Great writers and works are those who have made critical discoveries or raised questions about life, who have sharply questioned the state of human existence, and who have simply extolled the beauty and glory of life have their value, but not so much.
”真正值得拍成影视作品的文学作品不是没有，例如另一位武汉作家记录非典的某部小说，但遗憾还是成为“不可说”。
Literary works that are truly worth filming, such as another Wuhan writer who chronicles a SARS novel, have become "unspeakable."
人们也因此失去了看到这部文学作品被搬上荧屏的机会。
As a result, the opportunity to see the literary work on screen has been lost.
但曾经的读者没有忘记。
But the former reader did not forget.
有人在微博里引用书里的一句话：当他们不让你说的时候，就已经证实了你说的是事实。
Someone in Weibo quoted a quote from the book: When they won't let you say it, it proves that you are telling the truth.
人们逐渐认清了现实，对抗疫剧的要求其实已经非常简单：即使拍不出中国的《切尔诺贝利》，至少不要用煽情掩饰本来有机会弥补的过失，不要流露出“人类战胜了病毒”的沾沾自喜。
People have come to realize that the battle against the epidemic is simply too simple: even if Chornobyl for China is not to be made, at least not to cover up the wrong that could have been remedied by stirring up emotions, and not to exude the smugness that "man has conquered the virus."
但遗憾的是，六六已经开始在她的日记里展示国外飞中国的天价机票了。
But sadly, on the sixth day of the year, she began to display in her diary the sky-high price tickets for foreign flights to China.
有人在筹备抗疫剧的微博下留言，推荐应该全部启用湖北籍尤其是武汉籍演员出演，但有很多事比演员的籍贯重要。
Some people in preparation for the anti-epidemic drama Weibo message, recommended that Hubei nationality, especially Wuhan actors, should be used in full, but there are many things more important than the origin of the actors.
制片方表示，“计划筹拍20集，每2集1个独立故事”，就是10个故事。
"The producers say they plan to make 20 episodes of a single story every two episodes," or 10 stories.
这10个故事要如何取舍？既然这是一场举国参与的“人民战争”，那么由全国网友票选出最希望看到的十大事件作为蓝本，或许是最好的选择。
Since this is a nation-wide "people's war," it may be the best choice to base the selection of the top ten events to be seen by the nation's netizens.
这样甚至免去了六六不辞辛苦前往武汉调研——人们想要看到的那些事件，一些新闻报道已经写得十分详细了。
It even saves six or six years of painstaking research in Wuhan - events that people want to see, some of which have been reported in great detail.
唯一的问题在于，如果由全国人民投票，最终得票最高事件能上映的可能性恐怕微乎其微。
The only problem is that if the people vote, the chances of a top-vote showdown are slim.
还有武汉电影人自己的故事——武汉电影制片厂员工常凯，一家4口12天内相继离世。
Wuhan filmmaker's own story - Wuhan film studio staff Changkai, a family of four died in 12 days.
武汉影视界是否会选择自己来记录？抗战时期，老舍的独幕剧《保卫大武汉》曾经引起轰动。
Whether Wuhan film and television circles will choose to record themselves? Lao She's one-act play "Defend Greater Wuhan" once caused a sensation.
当时的武汉是全国政治文化中心，那是创作者的黄金时代，被记录在《武汉，1938：战争、难民与现代中国的形成》一书中。
Wuhan was then the national political and cultural center, the golden age of the creators, recorded in Wuhan, 1938: War, Refugees and the Formation of Modern China.
有人说：这个故事留下了很多经验，其中最有趣一个，是权力更迭提供了短暂的窗口期，自由媒体在这里蓬勃发展。
The story leaves a lot to be learned, one of the most interesting of which is that power changes provide a short window where free media flourish.
[3]许鞍华导演的《黄金时代》以民国女作家萧红为主角，提到了这段历史。
The Golden Age, directed by Anhua Xu, features Xiao Hong, a woman writer, and refers to this history.
因萧红在武汉短居期间完成了代表作《呼兰河传》的前两章，电影有众多场景在武汉取景。
Because Xiao Hong finished the first two chapters of "The Journey of the Hulan River" during his short stay in Wuhan, there are many scenes in Wuhan.
虽然身列左翼作家阵营，但萧红对宏大题材兴味索然，她关注个体苦难，与当时以革命写作为志向的另一女作家丁玲走上了两条截然不同的写作道路。
Though she was in the left-wing writers' camp, Xiao Hong was not interested in grand subjects. She was concerned about individual suffering and followed two very different paths with Ding Ling, another woman writer who aspired to revolutionary writing at the time.
03.许鞍华之外，中国第六代导演对武汉这座城市是有所偏爱的。
03. Apart from Xu Anhua, the sixth generation of Chinese directors were partial to the city of Wuhan.
继前一部电影被禁之后，娄烨的《浮城谜事》又以武汉为背景，“要拍细碎的生活，而武汉的城市格局、河流和气氛，非常适合故事”；《南方车站的聚会》导演刁亦男本来打算在广州拍摄，但勘景之后发现湖泊太少，最后选了武汉，“到那里待了两天，我们就敲定了”；王小帅13岁随父母来到武汉待过几年，钟爱武汉的长江和大桥，“小时候学画画，从华工骑自行车，一直骑到江边民主路，然后再坐轮渡过江。
After the previous film was banned, Lou Ye's "The Mystery of the Floating City" took Wuhan as the background, "to shoot a fine life, and Wuhan's urban pattern, rivers and atmosphere, and then decided to shoot in Wuhan," where we spent two days, we finalized.
”他的《扁担姑娘》在武汉拍摄，《地久天长》也曾来过武汉勘景。
"His" Lian Yu girl "was shot in Wuhan, and" The Longevity Month "has come to Wuhan for a survey.
在第六代导演的镜头中，江河湖水，以及建立在此上的长江大桥、码头轮渡是绝不会缺席的城市景观，但他们的电影中武汉人民的面孔是模糊的。
In the sixth-generation director's scenes, rivers and lakes, as well as the Yangtze River Bridge, ferry pier is never absent from the city's landscape, but the faces of the Wuhan people in their films are blurred.
祖籍山西的贾樟柯除了擅长讲述自己家乡的故事，倒是把重庆这座城市拍出了超越故事发生地之外的气质。
Jia Zhangke, a native of Shanxi, is not only good at telling stories about his hometown, but also taking Chongqing out of the city beyond the scene of the story.
他总是将镜头瞄准出现三峡库区的水位线——上升的水位淹没了居所和城市，也将一个时代埋入水底，当地人民背井离乡——这种失落，是第六代导演的创作母题。
He has always aimed his camera at the water line in the Three Gorges Reservoir region - where rising water levels have flooded homes and cities, buried an era in the water, and displaced local people - is the creative motif of the sixth generation of directors.
武汉和重庆都被称为江城，共饮一江水，本身也存在众多相似之处。
Wuhan and Chongqing are both called Jiangcheng, drinking a river in total, there are many similarities between them.
方方曾在散文《行云流水的武汉》里写：武汉的文化带有强烈本乡本土的味道，它和弥漫在市井的商业俗气混杂一起，便格外给人一种土俗土俗的感觉；但幸亏有了长江，是长江使这座城市充满了一股天然的雄浑大气。
In his prose Wuhan, Fang Fang wrote: Wuhan's culture has a strong local flavor, which, mixed with the commercial vulgarity that pervades the market, gives it a peculiar sense of vulgarity; but thanks to the Yangtze River, it is the Yangtze River that fills the city with a natural and powerful atmosphere.
但是，灾难过后，“我们不可能回到原来的武汉了”，武汉诗人小引说，这场灾难给每个武汉人都打上了标记，每个活下来的人，身上都写着“大难不死”。
However, after the disaster, "we can not go back to the original Wuhan," said the Wuhan poet Xiao Qun, the disaster marked every Wuhan people, every surviving person, written on the body of the "great survive.
[4]未来的武汉或许会像重庆一样，背负着一个沉重的时代符号走下去，随江河湖海一道融入这座城市的血液。
Wuhan, like Chongqing, may be carrying a heavy symbol of its time to enter the city's blood alongside the rivers, lakes and seas.
看《南方车站的聚会》的时候，片头字幕排版的格式让我觉得奇怪，但当时说不上来是哪里怪，后来看影评，有人说像刻着人名字的墓碑。
The format of the caption layout was strange to me when I saw "Gathering at South Station," but I couldn't say what strange it was then. Then, when I looked at the reviews, some people said it was like a tombstone with a human name.
确实如此。
That is true.
该歌颂的歌颂，该反思的反思，该祭奠的祭奠。
The eulogy of the eulogy, the reflection of the reflection, the commemoration of the commemoration.
至少不要让观众白流了眼泪。
At least don't let the audience cry in vain.
