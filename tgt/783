深度和角度——这就是我们能做的。
Depth and angle - that's what we can do.

我也是个普通人，也会恐惧。
I'm a normal guy, too, and I'm scared.
但我是一名医务工作者，同时是一名党员；我们黄冈的疫情是全国城市里除武汉之外最重的几个之一，这样的困难情况下，我们不去，谁去？必须要坚持，一定要挺住。
But I am a medical worker and a Party member; under such difficult circumstances, the situation in Huanggang is one of the heaviest in the country's cities except Wuhan.
口述 | 陈　林整理 | 王　煜我是湖北省黄冈市黄州区脑血管病医院神经内科的医生，目前的岗位在黄州区的一个防控新冠肺炎疫情的集中隔离点。
Chen Yu, a physician at the Department of Neurology at Huangzhou District, Huanggang City, Hubei Province, is currently at a centralized quarantine point for the prevention and control of new crown pneumonia in Huangzhou District.
截至2月10日，黄冈是新冠肺炎确诊人数仅次于武汉和孝感的城市，而累计死亡人数已经超过孝感。
As of Feb. 10, Huang Gang is the only city with the second highest number of confirmed cases of pneumonia after Wuhan and filial piety, and the cumulative death toll has surpassed filial piety.
腊月二十六（2020年1月20日）的时候，医院就通知了我们全体医护人员取消休假，准备投入到抗击疫情的工作中去。
On January 26th (January 20, 2020), the hospital informed all of our health care workers to cancel their vacation and prepare to take part in the fight against the epidemic.
除夕（1月24日）我和家人一起吃了团圆饭，第二天一早就到医院值班。
On New Year's Eve (January 24), I had a reunion dinner with my family and arrived at the hospital early the next morning.
年初三（2月1日）的时候，我们医院征集去隔离点工作的医护人员志愿者，我马上报了名。
On the third day of February 1, our hospital asked for volunteers to work in the quarantine point, and I immediately signed up.
我们工作的隔离点是从一家中职学校的宿舍楼改造来的，收治的是还未确诊的疑似病例和与确诊病例有过密切接触的人员，总共有70多张床位，这些天以来基本上都是满的。
The isolation point where we work was converted from the dormitory building of a secondary vocational school to accommodate undiagnosed suspected cases and persons in close contact with confirmed cases, with a total of more than 70 beds, which have been largely filled these days.
现在整个黄州区大约建了有二十几个这样的隔离点。
About twenty such sites have been built throughout Huangzhou.
黄冈市黄州区脑血管病医院的人员在开赴隔离点之前的合影在隔离点，我们医护人员的任务有这么几大项：一是保证收治进来的人员在他们每个人的单间妥善隔离。
Huanggang District, Huangzhou District, before the personnel of the cerebrovascular disease hospital before driving to the isolation point in the quarantine point, our medical staff's tasks have several major tasks: one is to ensure that the admitted personnel in each of their individual rooms are properly isolated.
二是针对患者已经出现的发热等症状给予治疗；以及有些人除了新冠肺炎的疑似症状之外，还有一些其他的基础病症，也需要我们的治疗。
The second is to treat the fever that has developed; and some people have other underlying conditions that require treatment in addition to the suspected symptoms of new crown pneumonia.
三是如果有人确认为新冠肺炎病例，就要统一转移到大别山区域医疗中心去治疗，我们要协助他们的转诊。
Third, if someone confirms the case of Newly Coronary Pneumonia, we will transfer them to Dabie Mountain Regional Medical Center for treatment, and we will facilitate their referral.
另外，我们还要照顾他们的饮食等生活起居，以及给他们做心理疏导。
In addition, we have to take care of their diet and other living, as well as psychological counseling.
有些人不是自己愿意来，是社区报告之后被送过来的，他们会抱怨：“我现在什么症状也没有，为什么要把我关在这里？”有的人在这里待了几天后，觉得很枯燥，规定的隔离期没满就想要出去。
Some people don't come of their own accord and are sent in after a community report, and they complain, "I don't have any symptoms right now, why should I be confined here?" Some people, after a few days here, find it boring and want to go out before the prescribed isolation period is over.
遇到这样的情况，我们都耐心地劝说开导他们，跟他们多说说，很多人还是能理解的。
When things like this happen, we patiently persuade them to talk to them, and a lot of people will understand.
我们现在是一天四班倒，每个人每天负责6个小时。
We are running four shifts a day and each of us is responsible for six hours a day.
我前一天是负责晚上7点到凌晨1点的时段，接下来要负责凌晨1点到早上7点。
I was in charge of the hours from 7: 00 to 1: 00 a.m. the day before, and then from 1: 00 a.m. to 7: 00 a.m.
加上穿脱防护服和交接班的时间，我每天至少有7个小时，在隔离点上班是不吃不喝不上厕所的。
Add in protective clothing and hand-over time, and I spend at least seven hours a day working in isolation without eating or drinking toilet.
人在防护服里特别闷热，护目镜容易起雾视线不清；我们这个隔离点没有电梯，经常需要楼上楼下奔走；工作量还是挺大的。
People are particularly sultry in protective clothing, and goggles make foggy vision difficult to see; we have no elevators in this isolation area and often have to run up and down the stairs; the workload is considerable.
在这几个小时里，我们一直戴着口罩和护目镜等，勒得很痛，同事之间开玩笑说“感觉好像耳朵都要被勒掉了”。
For hours we wore masks and goggles, strangled, joking among colleagues that "it felt as if our ears were going to be strangled."
医院给我们在隔离点边上找了个宾馆，我下了班之后就去宾馆休息，第二天再接着来。
The hospital found us a hotel on the edge of the quarantined site. After I left work, I went to the hotel to rest and came back the next day.
陈林在隔离点工作中从到隔离点上班直到现在，我感觉一般的医疗物资是够用的，每天我们医院的工作人员会清点物资，如果发现不够了就会向有关部门报告申请。
Chen Lin worked in the quarantine point from work to the isolation point until now, I feel that the general medical supplies are sufficient, every day our hospital staff will count the materials, if not enough will report the application to the relevant departments.
感觉上就是防护服不是太多，但我们目前也都能用上。
It feels like there's not a lot of protective clothing, but we can all use it right now.
我们每个医护人员也都很节约物资，尽全力一个班次就用一套防护装备，不增加物资负担。
Each of us is also very economical material, try our best to use a set of protective equipment on a shift, do not increase the material burden.
这样的工作已经连续十几天了，我觉得对我们医护人员的生理和心理都是很大的考验。
This kind of work has been going on for ten days and I think it is a great test for the physiology and psychology of our medical staff.
医院领导一直嘱咐我们吃好休息好，也保证了我们的伙食供应。
Hospital leaders have been telling us to eat good rest, but also to ensure that our food supply.
我觉得，在每次上班前做好准备，我才不到四十岁，能扛住。
I feel like I'm not forty years old enough to hold my own before I go to work.
我也是个普通人，也会恐惧。
I'm a normal guy, too, and I'm scared.
我们隔离点曾经集中确诊一批20多个新冠肺炎患者，那样的情况，说心里不怕是假的。
Our quarantine site once centrally diagnosed a group of more than 20 patients with pneumonia, that kind of situation, said the heart is not afraid of false.
但我是一名医务工作者，同时是一名党员；我们黄冈的疫情是全国城市里除武汉之外最重的几个之一，这样的困难情况下，我们不去，谁去？必须要坚持，一定要挺住。
But I am a medical worker and a Party member; under such difficult circumstances, the situation in Huanggang is one of the heaviest in the country's cities except Wuhan.
前几天看到李文亮医生去世的消息，我很痛心，但并没有因此感到更害怕，而是感到自己有了更多的力量要去努力工作对抗疫情。
The other day I saw the death of Dr. Liang Wenliang, I was very sad, but not more afraid, but I feel that I have more strength to work hard to fight the epidemic.
就像在战斗中，看见身边的战友倒下，我就更要坚持下去，全力把这场仗打赢。
As in the battle, to see the fallen comrades around me, I will stick to the fight and fight to win it.
我们隔离点有个九岁的小姑娘，一个人待在里面，没有家里的大人陪她。
We had a nine-year-old girl in the quarantine, alone, without her adult family.
她很可怜也很乖。
She was pathetic and good-natured.
我和同事们在交好班之后，每天都会去看她，跟她说说话，特别关照她。
My co-workers and I visited her every day, talked to her, and gave her special attention after we had a good class.
幸运的是，她经过两次核酸检测都是阴性，也没有发热，可以解除隔离安心出去了。
Luckily, she was tested negative for two nucleic acid tests and did not have fever. She was released from isolation and released.
她离开的那天，我们同事几个一起送她回家。
On the day she left, our colleagues accompanied her home.
陈林和同事们送解除隔离的小姑娘回家看到那个小姑娘，我也想起我自己的女儿、我的家人。
Chen Lin and his colleagues to send the little girl back home from isolation to see the little girl, I also think of my own daughter, my family.
我已经十几天没回过家了，其实在隔离点怎么累都没什么，我就是挺想家人的。
I haven't been home in ten days, in fact, it is nothing to be tired at the isolation point, I just miss my family.
我妻子和我在同一家医院工作，她的岗位在检验部门。
My wife and I work in the same hospital and her position is in the inspection department.
前些天一个老年患者隐瞒自己的发热症状，来我妻子的部门做颅内供血的检查，结果后来被确诊为新冠肺炎；我妻子当时和那个患者有过密切接触，因此马上也被隔离观察，目前已经隔离了一星期多了。
The other day an elderly patient came to my wife's department for an internal blood supply and was later diagnosed with pneumonia; my wife was in close contact with the patient and was therefore immediately quarantined for more than a week.
这样一来，家里就只有我的妈妈一个人带着我的两个孩子，大娃女儿12岁，二娃儿子才一岁多。
That left my mother with my two children, the eldest, 12, and the second, just over a year old.
我现在基本也只能跟孩子们视频说说话了。
I can only talk to the kids on video now.
儿子在除夕的时候还不会叫爸爸，这些天他可能是想我了，加上他姐姐每天在家里教他，最近一次视频里他都会叫我了，我挺高兴的。
My son doesn't call me Daddy on New Year's Eve. He probably thinks of me these days, and his sister teaches him at home every day.
前两天下班后，我想见见女儿，就跑到自家楼下，也不敢上楼进家门去，怕自己有潜在的感染风险会传染他们。
The other day, after work, I wanted to meet my daughter and ran downstairs to my house. I didn't dare to go upstairs for fear that my potential infection would infect them.
女儿在5楼的阳台上，我俩就这么隔空喊了几句话：“在家乖不乖啊？乖！弟弟睡着了吗？睡着了。
Daughter in the balcony on the fifth floor, we just shouted a few words across the air: "Home obediently? Good boy! Brother asleep? Sleeping.
在家要听奶奶的话，知道吗？知道了！说完，我就匆匆地走了。
At home to listen to Grandma, you know? Got it! Finished, I left in a hurry.
陈林和同事们我希望疫情能早些结束，我就能回家和孩子们一起了。
Chen Lin and his colleagues I hope the epidemic will end soon and I will be able to go home with the children.
不光是我们医护人员，隔离点的后勤人员、志愿者、警察，还有在抗击疫情的很多人，大家都很辛苦很不容易。
Not only are we paramedics, the logisticians, the volunteers, the police, and a lot of people fighting the epidemic, it's hard and not easy.
希望大家都可以早些回家。
I hope everyone can go home early.
