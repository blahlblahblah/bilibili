在全国人民对抗肺炎疫情的战役中，很多人都在想办法贡献绵薄之力，但是一些浑水摸鱼的行为也开始浮出水面，有些商家开始坐地起价，有些公司开始借疫情敛财……记者 | 谢九最近，长租公寓市场的领头羊之一蛋壳公寓，就通过一系列操作将自己推到了风口浪尖。
While many people throughout the country are trying to make a modest contribution to the fight against pneumonia, muddled fishing is beginning to surface, with some businesses starting to sit on the sidelines and others taking advantage of the epidemic.
很多房东在网上投诉，蛋壳公寓单方面通知他们，为了配合政府防控疫情，要求房东执行30天的免租期，有些武汉地区的房东甚至被要求3个月的免租。
Many landlords complained online, and eggshell apartments told them unilaterally that they were required to comply with a 30-day rent-free period as part of the Government's efforts to control the epidemic, and that some Wuhan-area landlords were even required to rent-free for three months.
所谓免租期，也就是在此期间不给房东支付房租。
The so-called rent-free period means that the landlord is not paid rent during this period.
房东方面如果不接受免租，蛋壳公寓则以疫情带来的卫生事件属于不可抗力来回复。
Landlord side if do not accept rent-free, eggshell apartment with the outbreak of health events is force majeure to reply.
在遭遇质疑之后，蛋壳公寓紧急发布了一封给租客的公开信，表示将为武汉无法返城的租客返还一个月租金，3月2日后租客可登录蛋壳APP查看，对其他各城市租客，将结合当地政策和疫情进展，返还相应租金，或提供相应的免费延住天数。
After being questioned, the eggshell apartment issued an open letter to the tenants, saying that they would return one month's rent to the tenants who could not return to Wuhan. After March 2, tenants can log on to the egg shell APP.
不过，即使武汉的租客能够获得一个月租金返还，也远低于蛋壳对房东要求的1到3个月免租期，对武汉之外的其他城市，蛋壳最终如何返还以及返还多少，也是语焉不详。
However, even if Wuhan renters can get a monthly rent return, it is far less than the shell requirements for landlords rent-free period of one to three months, for other cities outside Wuhan, the final return of eggs shell and how much.
有些租客因为疫情无法返回所在城市希望能够退租，据悉蛋壳对每天的退租人数设置了一定的上限，大部分租客在申请退租时都难以成功。
Some tenants are unable to return to their cities because of the outbreak, and it is understood that eggshells have set a ceiling on the number of rentals per day. Most tenants have difficulty in applying for rent refunds.
从房东的角度来看，银行并没有减免自己的房贷，即使在疫情期间也要照常偿还月供，全部让自己来承担疫情损失并不公平，如果自己减免的租金能够全部转移给租客，有些房客可能还能够接受，但是如果被中介截留，成为某些人发国难财的机会，显然就超出了底线。
From the landlord's point of view, banks have not forgiven their mortgages, and it would be unfair to let themselves bear the full cost of the epidemic, even during an epidemic. Some tenants may be able to accept if their rents are fully transferred to renters, but clearly overstepping the line if they are retained by intermediaries as an opportunity for some to make national fortunes.
当然，蛋壳公寓的免租操作才刚刚开始，现在还只能说有截留租金的嫌疑，最终扣减了房东多少租金，其中有多少转移支付给了租客，还需要时间来验证，如果蛋壳公寓最终大量截留了房东的租金变为自己的收入，就将坐实外界对其发国难财的指责。
Of course, the rent-free operation for eggshell apartments has only just begun, and it is now a matter of suspicion that the rent will be withheld, how much of the rent is deducted from the landlord and how much of it is paid to the tenant.
最近几年，国内开始鼓励发展租房市场，大量资本蜂拥而入，试图抢占政策风口，长租公寓应运而生。
In recent years, China began to encourage the development of the rental market, a large number of capital rushed in, trying to seize the policy vent, long-rented apartments emerged.
这个新兴行业在高速发展的同时，也爆出了太多负面新闻，比如甲醛超标导致租客因白血病死亡、租客被骗签署贷款协议、平台跑路导致租客血本无归等等。
While the new industry is growing at a high speed, it has also produced too much bad news, such as the death of a tenant due to formaldehyde, the signing of a loan agreement by a tenant, and the loss of money due to the platform running.
由于国内租房市场的回报率较低，很多大城市的租金回报都不到2%，所以，这几年看似热闹的长租公寓，很多都是在赔本赚吆喝。
With rents in many big cities earning less than 2% because of the low returns in the domestic rental market, many of these seemingly boisterous long-rented apartments have lost money in recent years.
加之长租公寓普遍采用“高进低出”的竞争模式，也就是从房东手中高价收房，再以相对便宜的价格租给客户，以互联网企业的烧钱模式来跑马圈地，这就更加剧了亏损压力。
This is compounded by the "high-in-low-out" model of competition for long-rented apartments, which consists of high-priced home sales from landlords and renting them to customers at relatively low prices, with Internet companies running horses in the form of money-burning, which exacerbates the pressure for losses.
同时长租公寓还普遍采用金融高杠杆，让这个行业更是风险重重，早在去年就有业内人士警告，长租公寓一旦爆雷比P2P还可怕。
And the widespread use of financial leverage in long-rented apartments makes the industry even riskier, with industry insiders warning as early as last year that a long-rented apartment would be worse than a P2P.
蛋壳公寓5 年时间里疯狂扩张了 13 个城市蛋壳公寓是国内长租公寓市场的头部企业，今年1月中旬刚刚在美国上市，但即便如此，也面临着极大的业绩压力，按照公司的招股说明书，2017年和2018年，公司分别亏损了将近3亿元和14亿元，去年前三季度，亏损额更是扩大到25亿元。
Even the 13-city egg-shell condominium, the head of China's long-rented apartment market, which went public in the US in mid-January this year, is under intense pressure to report losses of nearly $300 million and $1.4 billion in 2017 and 2018, respectively, according to its prospectus, and widened to $2.5 billion in the first three quarters of last year.
肺炎疫情爆发后，租房市场的需求下降，公司将面临更大的经营压力，这或许是蛋壳近期涉嫌截留房东租金的主要动机。
With declining demand in the rental market after the outbreak of pneumonia, the company will face greater operational pressure, which may be the main motive for the recent suspected rent withholding from landlords.
无独有偶，就在蛋壳风波还在沸沸扬扬之际，长租公寓另外一家规模更大的龙头企业自如也被网友曝光，利用疫情期间租客不便搬家，自如的续租价格普遍上涨了10%-30%。
Meanwhile, just as the shell storm was still raging, another, larger, condominium was also exposed by netizens, taking advantage of the fact that tenants were unable to move during the epidemic, with the price of a comfortable extension rising by 10% to 30%.
在被曝光之后，自如对涨价做出的解释是因为长租客想改为短期续约。
After the exposure, the explanation for the easy rise in prices was that long-term tenants wanted to switch to short-term renewals.
疫情当前，很多国内企业都有不小的经营压力，但应对压力应该采取正确的姿势。
The epidemic, many domestic enterprises have not small business pressure, but should take the right attitude to deal with the pressure.
最近，很多企业开始积极互助自救，比如表示贷款也只能支撑三个月的西贝餐饮，该公司的1000名员工最近去盒马上班了。
Recently, companies have been actively helping each other out, saying loans can only last three months at Sebe Restaurant, where 1,000 employees recently went to work in boxes.
因为疫情爆发后，以盒马为代表的部分公司线上业务繁忙，用工需求比平时更多，而部分传统餐饮零售企业大量员工闲置，带来巨大的成本压力。
After the outbreak of the epidemic, some companies, such as box horses, were busy with their online business and needed more jobs than usual, while a large number of employees in some traditional catering and retail enterprises were idle, bringing huge cost pressures.
通过合作，既可以解决线上公司的用工荒，又可以帮助传统企业渡过难关，从更长远来看，甚至还可能因为这场疫情创造出共享员工这种全新的经营模式。
By working together, we can not only solve the shortage of employees in online companies, but also help traditional enterprises to tide over the difficulties, and in the long run, even create a new way of doing business by sharing employees.
这些在危机关口积极自救的企业，有些最终可能还会转危为机，但是那些靠小聪明发国难财的公司，即使能够获一时之利，长远来看也没有太大的前途。
Some of these firms, which actively bail themselves out at the point of crisis, may eventually turn the corner, but those firms that are struggling to make a fortune by being smart have little, if any, future in the long run.
蛋壳公寓的争议行为只是当前的不和谐音之一。
The controversial behavior of the eggshell apartment is just one of the current discordant voices.
最近一段时间，网上开始流传某知名经济学家鼓励发国难财的观点，理由是在灾难期间很多物质都短缺，那些坐地起价的行为，其实是增加了市场供给，而且，价格的变动最终会使得供需关系走向平衡，所以，应该对发国难财的行为给予赞美和鼓励。
Recently, the Internet began to spread the idea that a well-known economist encouraged the development of national wealth, on the grounds that many materials are in short supply during a disaster, that sitting on the ground increases the supply of the market, and that changes in prices eventually balance supply and demand.
图 | 摄图网首先且不论这种观点背后的道德观，即使从经济学的角度来看，这个看似独辟蹊径的观念其实也根本站不住脚。
Above all, and regardless of the morality behind this view, even from an economic point of view, this seemingly novel idea simply does not hold water.
比如在这次疫情中最紧缺的口罩，如果所有的口罩生产商和销售商都开始坐地起价发国难财，就可以增加口罩的供给解决口罩的短缺问题吗？显然不能！因为在疫情时期，口罩已经成为一种特殊商品，对于价格变动完全缺乏敏感，尤其是医护人员，对于口罩的需求更是刚性，即使口罩炒到天价，医护人员也不能完全不用口罩，对于政府采购而言，该买的口罩最后一定还是要买。
If all mask makers and vendors start sitting on their seats, can they increase supply of face masks to meet the shortage? Apparently not! Because masks are a special commodity in times of crisis and are completely insensitive to price changes.
而且，疫情期间对于口罩的大量消耗，对于口罩的需求也近乎无穷，口罩的需求量不会因为价格变动而有所缩减。
Moreover, during the outbreak of large-scale consumption of masks, the demand for masks almost unlimited, the demand for masks will not be reduced by price changes.
所以，口罩商们坐地起价，根本解决不了口罩的短缺问题，反而会增加采购口罩的成本，只会给医护人员的口罩供给带来更大的难度，不仅增加医护人员的风险，更增加了抗疫的难度。
As a result, the mask vendors will not be able to cope with the shortage of face masks at all. Instead, they will increase the cost of purchasing them, making it more difficult for medical staff to supply them, increasing the risk to medical staff and making it more difficult to combat the disease.
对于这种发国难财的行为，又有何值得赞美和鼓励之处？远征 摄这场肺炎疫情，对全国大部分人都是一场灾难，但对于少数个别群体，可能反而是一次发国难财的良机。
What are the praiseworthy and encouraging aspects of this unfortunateThe expedition to contain the pneumonia is a disaster for most people in the country, but for a few individual groups, it may be a great opportunity to make a fortune.
大部分人在内心道德感和外部压力的制约下，对于发国难财这种行为都会有所忌惮和约束，但是一旦有些人获得了理论支持，比如应该鼓励和赞美发国难财的言论，就会给自己发国难财找到足够的借口和理由，可以更加堂而皇之和心安理得赚昧心钱，由此，发国难财的行为将会迅速扩散和升级。
Most people are afraid and restrained by inner moral sense and external pressure, but once some people get theoretical support, such as encouraging and praising the rich speech, they will find enough excuse and reason to earn money without feeling comfortable and dignified, thus the act of making national wealth will spread and escalate rapidly.
当前，中国正面临双线作战的压力，一方面要早日击退肺炎疫情，同时还要尽量避免经济受到太大冲击，保持社会秩序稳定。
At present, China is under pressure to fight on two fronts. On the one hand, we need to fight off pneumonia at an early date.
随着疫情持续的时间越来越长，会有更多的企业和个人感受到疫情带来的经济压力，当压力上升到一定程度之后，可能会有越来越多的人开始铤而走险发国难财。
As the epidemic continues to unfold, more businesses and individuals will feel the economic strain of the epidemic, and as the pressure rises to a point, more and more people are likely to take the risk of becoming rich.
如果不能对这种行为保持足够的警惕并及时制止，将会给中国经济带来更大的冲击，给社会制造更大的混乱。
Failure to be sufficiently vigilant against such actions, and to stop them in time, will have a greater impact on China's economy and create more social chaos.
