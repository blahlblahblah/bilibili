来源：受访者提供 视频编辑：吴佳颖(01:06)到湖北武汉后，陈晓欢才真实地感受到患者的焦虑，她也开始思考：面对焦虑，护理人员还能做点什么呢？在重症病房内，护士照顾患者的生活起居、用药等护理工作。
Only after Wu Jiaying (01: 06) arrived in Wuhan, Hubei Province, did Chen Huanhuan truly feel the anxiety of her patients, and she began to wonder what nurses can do to cope with the anxiety.
本文图片 受访者供图陈晓欢是福建省立医院护理部主任，2月13日随福建援鄂医疗队来到武汉，目前在华中科技大学同济医学院附属协和医院肿瘤中心，负责Z12病区新冠肺炎重症病房的护理管理工作。
This picture shows the interviewee Chen Huan is the director of the Nursing Department of Fujian Provincial Hospital. On February 13, he came to Wuhan with the Fujian Medical Team and is now in charge of the nursing management of the New Crown Pneumonia Severe Ward in the Z12 area.
可能一些人会认为，病人的康复，最主要的是靠治疗。
Some people may think that the most important part of a patient's recovery is treatment.
然而在陈晓欢看来，患者保持一个良好的精神状态，和治疗同样关键。
In Chen's view, however, keeping patients in a good state of mind is as crucial as treatment.
“一个人在情绪低落的时候，免疫力是下降的，低落的情绪会影响患者的休息、睡眠、饮食。
"When one is feeling down, one's immunity is reduced, and the low mood affects one's rest, sleep and diet.
如果患者觉得心情舒畅，免疫力自然就提高了。
If the patient feels at ease, immunity will naturally improve.
” 陈晓欢接受澎湃新闻（www.thepaper.cn）采访时说，可以肯定的是，好的情绪能够帮助病人早日的康复。
'To be sure, a good mood can help patients recover sooner, 'Mr. Chen said in an interview with the news agency www.theepaper.cn.
除了负责患者的生活起居，日常活动、用药等护理工作外，陈晓欢带领护理团队还成立心理疏导专科小组，通过话疗、支持性心理疗法等措施对焦虑患者进行心理疏导，打开病人的心扉，倾听他们的诉说，缓解其担忧、焦虑、紧张等不良情绪。
In addition to taking care of patients' daily life, daily activities, medication, etc., Chen also led the nursing team to set up a psychological counseling team, through telephone therapy, supportive psychotherapy and other measures to ease anxiety patients, open their hearts, listen to their voices, ease their worries, anxiety, tension and other negative feelings.
在重症病房内，护士照顾患者的生活起居、用药等护理工作。
In the intensive care unit, nurses take care of the patients' life, medication and other nursing work.
本文图片 受访者供图小焦虑和大关心在Z12病区住院的，收治的都是新冠肺炎的重症患者，60岁以上患者占比超过60%。
In the Z12 area, patients with severe coronary pneumonia accounted for more than 60% of patients over 60 years of age.
每个患者入院时，护士都使用《住院患者抑郁和焦虑筛查自评量表》对患者进行心理评估。
At the time of admission, nurses used the Self-rating Depression and Anxiety Screening Self-rating Form for Inpatients to conduct psychological assessments.
有的人看似正常，评估后才能发现异常，评估结果大于6分以上的护士就对患者采取心理干预。
Some people seem to be normal, after the evaluation of abnormal findings, the evaluation of more than 6 nurses on the patient's psychological intervention.
”陈晓欢说。
"said Chen Huan.
同时她们也发现，一些患者在评估时是正常，但情绪有时也容易出现起伏和波动，也需要护士给予关心和关注。
They also found that while some patients were assessed as normal, mood swings and fluctuations sometimes required the attention and attention of nurses.
心理上的焦虑和不安主要体现在语言上的过激。
Psychological anxiety and uneasiness are mainly manifested in the language of the extreme.
“很急躁，你跟他说什么他都不爱理你，或者就不理你。
"Very impatient, what you tell him he does not love you, or just ignore you.
有时也不配合治疗。
Sometimes they do not cooperate with treatment.
”陈晓欢说，之前有个病人，他总怀疑每天吃的药是否有用？是不是有问题？是不是毒药？一直处于焦虑、不信任、不配合的状态。
'There was a patient who used to wonder if the medicine he took every day was useful? Was it a problem? Was it poison? A state of constant anxiety, mistrust and non-cooperation.
针对一些焦虑的患者，陈晓欢带着护士们采用话疗的方式，跟病人进行有技巧的交谈，分散患者对疾病的注意力，让病人把他的想法说出来。
In response to some anxious patients, Chen Huan and her nurses talk skillfully with their patients to distract them from the disease and get them to speak out.
她发现，其实很多影响病人情绪的是一些小焦虑，在外人看来，可能都是小事情。
In fact, she found, many of the things that affect patients' moods are minor anxieties that outsiders might see as small things.
福建省立医院护理7组的护士们利用休息时间，给患者们画了各种的"加油小插画"。
Fujian Provincial Hospital took advantage of its break to paint its patients with every kind of & quot; refuel illustration; & quot;
比如有一位患者，家里养了一只小狗，患者先去了方舱医院，然后又被转运到Z12病区治疗。
One patient, for example, had a dog in his home. The patient went to the cabin hospital and was then transferred to the Z12 area for treatment.
他的小狗在家大概有几天没人照顾了，他非常焦虑，心里总想：我的小狗怎么办？患者多次打电话跟社区联系，社区工作人员任务重，一时也顾不过来。
His dog had been unattended for a few days, and he was so anxious that he thought, What about my little dog? The patient called the community many times and the community workers were overwhelmed.
这时，他就比较躁动，和护士交流时，也会说一些比较过激的语言。
At this time, he is more restless, and the nurse communicates, also can say some more extreme language.
这一切，负责的护士看在眼里，急在心里。
All this, the responsible nurse in the eye, anxious in mind.
由于在医院隔离区不能用手机，等到下班以后出来，她们就用手机帮忙联系社区，当天晚上打了好几次电话，那边也没有人接。
Unable to use their cell phones in the hospital's isolation area, they contacted the community on their mobile phones after work. Several calls were made that evening and no one answered.
第二天，在护士锲而不舍的坚持下，终于联系上了社区，恳请社区工作人员到患者家中，拍一段小狗安好的视频，传给患者，“他感到非常开心，一直向护士表达感谢。
The next day, persevering in the nurse's perseverance, he finally contacted the community and begged the community workers to come to the patient's home and take a video of the dog's well-being.
”还有一位糖尿病患者，他日常注射胰岛素用的是直径6毫米的针头，然而在病房里只有8毫米的，就很不开心：“怎么回事，为什么给我用8毫米针头，你们不知道吗？很痛啊。
And a diabetic, who routinely injects insulin with a 6-millimeter-diameter needle, is unhappy in a ward of only 8 millimetres: "What's the matter, why do you give me an 8mm needle?
”“病人很生气的时候，一定不能去火上浇油。
'When the patient is very angry, he must not go to the fire to pour oil.
”陈晓欢说，遇到这种情况，首先要倾听患者的讲述，然后再解释。
In this case, listen to the patient's story first, then explain it, 'says Mr. Chen.
最后，陈晓欢下班后前往医院外面的药店，终于买到了6毫米的针头。
Finally, Chen Huan went to the pharmacy outside the hospital after work and finally bought a 6 mm needle.
拿进去后患者就觉得很开心，觉得事情得到了解决。
After taking it in, the patient felt very happy and felt that the matter had been solved.
“虽然是简单的举措，但是关注的是细节，细微之处的关心能让病人感受到我们的爱和关心。
"It's a simple step, but it's about the details, the little things that care can make the patient feel our love and care.
”陈晓欢说。
"said Chen Huan.
陈晓欢护理团队撰写一封致新冠肺炎患者的信，信中告诉患者，“我们不远千里来到这里，最重要的责任和使命就是照顾好您。
Chen's nursing team wrote a letter to patients with pneumonia, telling them, "We have come a long way, the most important responsibility and mission is to take care of you.
”用信和漫画激励住院者住在隔离病房里，患者与家人隔绝，与外面社会隔绝，很多人不知道患有这样的疾病，即将面临着什么？网络上杂乱信息和负面情绪也容易引发患者的不安。
Using letters and comics to motivate inpatients to stay in isolation, cut off from their families and the outside world, many people don't know what to expect with a disease like this? Clutter and negative emotions on the Internet also tend to upset patients.
为此，陈晓欢护理团队撰写一封致新冠肺炎患者的信，信中告诉患者，“我们理解你们的感受，我们千里迢迢来到武汉的目的就是照顾好你们。
"We understand how you feel, and we came all the way to Wuhan to take care of you," Chen's nursing team wrote in a letter to patients suffering from pneumonia.
”这封信给了很多的患者信心与勇气。
The letter gave a lot of confidence and courage to the patients.
她记得，之前有一家三口同时入院，开始对护士态度很一般，不愿意多说话。
She remembers a family of three who had been admitted to the hospital at the same time and began to treat nurses with a moderate attitude and were reluctant to talk much.
之后，医生主动和他们的孩子聊，不聊疾病，就聊上学的事儿。
After that, the doctors took the initiative to talk to their children about school without talking about the disease.
父母看见孩子聊的很开心，就主动凑过来了。
The parents saw the children chatting happily, so they volunteered to come over.
慢慢地，一家三口对医生、护士都产生好感，话匣子也打开了，现在正在逐步恢复健康状态。
Gradually, the family became fond of the doctors and nurses. The chatterbox was opened, and the family was gradually returning to good health.
有个患者因为饭送的时间稍晚了点，一开始很生气，护士则一直陪在一旁听她述说，最后，这个患者也觉得不好意思了，“其实，我说出来也就舒服了”。
One patient was angry at first because the meal was delivered a little late, and the nurse was always there to listen to her. Finally, the patient was embarrassed.
离开时，护士还向她保证，晚饭的时候，一定照顾到她的需求。
As she left, the nurse assured her that her needs would be taken care of during dinner.
还有一位患者是医生，不幸染病住进了Z12病区，目前已出院。
Another patient, a doctor, was hospitalized in the Z12 area and is now discharged.
出院前，他对护士表示感激：“你们的医生护士关心每一个患者，经常陪着说话，第一天住院的时候，我把我的情况说出来以后，明显感觉身体舒服很多。
Before I left the hospital, he thanked the nurse, "Your doctors and nurses care about everyone and often talk with each other. On the first day I was in the hospital, I clearly felt much better.
”在陈晓欢带领的医护团队第七组，护理人员为了鼓励患者，增加信心，连夜手绘漫画，以“大白”的形象画了很多病房生活与工作中的场景，比如推车分发午餐，穿着隔离服的样子。
In the seventh group, led by Chen, nursing staff drew comic books overnight to encourage patients to feel more confident, depicting scenes of life and work in the wards, such as wheelbarrows handing out lunches and wearing segregated clothing.
漫画旁边还特意写了很多鼓励的话语，比如“您是最棒的”“吃饱了，才有力气战胜病毒”等。
"The cartoon also intentionally wrote a lot of encouraging words, such as" you are the best "" eat enough to have the strength to defeat the virus, "etc.
陈晓欢说，当护士将漫画分发到患者的手中时，看见的都是开心的笑脸，听见的都是一句句感谢的话语。
When nurses handed out comics to patients, they saw happy smiling faces and heard every word of thanks, Chen said.
在Z12病区，陈晓欢带领的护理团队已经收到十余份出院患者写的感谢信，她和护士们还建立了“暖心祝福墙”，张贴祝福语和感谢信，希望借此来鼓励还在住院的患者：“让我们一起勇敢面对，互相守望，迎接出院的那一天。
In the Z12 area, Chen's nursing team has received more than a dozen thank-you notes from patients leaving the hospital. She and the nurses have set up a "Warm Heartwarming Blessings Wall" with posters and thank-you notes to encourage hospitalized patients: "Let's face it up and watch for the day we leave.
