Journalist / Yan Xingyue Editor / Chien-yue Song Jianhua Jiang roars through the streets of Florence, Italy, wearing a mask on Feb. 2, standing in the middle of a square, screaming in a mask and blindfolded with black cloth.
他的身边立着一块牌子，上面写着：“我不是病毒，我是人类，不要对我有歧视”。
Near him stood a sign that said, "I am not a virus, I am a human, do not discriminate against me."
武汉疫情尚未平息，各国都在为控制疫情的蔓延做出努力。

In the afternoon of January 31, two women beat a 23-year-old Chinese female student in central Berlin, calling her a "Chinese virus."
同一天，《明镜周刊》新一期的封面标题为：“新型冠状病毒：中国制造”。

在韩国，青瓦台国民请愿网页上要求禁止中国人入境的请愿书收到67万人联署。
In South Korea, a petition on the Qingwadai National Petitions web page seeking a ban on Chinese entry was signed by 670,000 people.

走上街头的前一天，姜啸在一个视频中看到，在佛罗伦萨的阿诺河边，一位意大利人要求一群亚洲游客“回家去”，不要把病毒带进意大利。
The day before he took to the streets, Jiang whistled in a video of an Italian demanding that a group of Asian tourists "go home" and not bring the virus into Italy on the banks of the Ano River in Florence.
这让他感到很心痛，“我没有办法假装没看见”。
It pained him. "I can't pretend not to see it."
第二天，他和朋友发起了一场反病毒歧视的“实验”。
The next day, he and his friends launched an "experiment" in anti-virus discrimination.
在意大利市中心街头那块写有“我不是病毒，我是人，不要对我有歧视”的牌子旁，姜啸蒙着眼睛、戴着口罩，在未知的焦虑中，迎来了街头陌生人的第一个反应——一个拥抱。
By the sign that says "I'm not a virus, I'm a person, don't discriminate against me" on the streets of downtown Italy, Wuthering eyes and wearing a mask ushered in the first reaction of a stranger in the street - a hug.
视频上传至网络后，有意大利人在视频下留言说，“我突然就明白了你的处境。
After the video was uploaded to the Internet, an Italian message on the video said, "I suddenly understand your situation.
”姜啸和伙伴们一起拍摄反病毒歧视街头实验的视频“我没有办法假装没看见”29岁的姜啸来自浙江温州，7岁时跟随父母来到意大利定居，现在一个化学实验室工作。
"I can't pretend not to see it," says Jiang Wuthering, 29, of Wenzhou, Zhejiang, who followed his parents to Italy when he was seven and now works in a chemical laboratory.
离家太久，姜啸的中文已经生疏，可他说“我就是一个中国人”。
Leave home too long, ginger is unfamiliar with Chinese, but he said "I am a Chinese."
2月1日，姜啸在网上看到一个视频：佛罗伦萨的阿诺河边，一个意大利人对着一群亚洲游客说，“回家去”，不要把病毒带进意大利。
An Italian man said to a group of Asian tourists, "Go home" and do not bring the virus into Italy.
画面里的亚洲人姜啸并不认识，但是他感到很痛心，“我没有办法假装没看见。
The Asian man in the picture, Jiang Wuthering, did not know him, but he felt very sad, "I can not pretend not to see.
”当天晚上，姜啸与华人好友夏宏望讨论，怎样才能更好地发出“反歧视”的声音。
Jiang and his Chinese friend Xia Hongwang discussed how best to speak out against discrimination that evening.
很快，摄像师Irene Saccenti和助手Silvia Mignanti 也加入其中，四人决定策划一个反歧视“实验”，并为此拍摄视频。
Soon, cameraman Irene Saccenti and assistant Silvia Mignanti joined in, and the four decided to plan an anti-discrimination "experiment" and filmed a video for it.
“ 我这样做是为了向所有人展示，特别是那些对中国人有偏见的人。
"I'm doing this to show everyone, especially those who are biased against the Chinese people.
中国现在遇到了麻烦，必须有人站起来做一些积极而有意义的事情。
China is now in trouble and someone must stand up and do something positive and meaningful.
” 姜啸和夏宏望一起想好了要写在字牌上的话：“我不是病毒，我是人类，不要对我有歧视”。
Jiang and Xia Hongwang together thought of the words to be written on the sign: "I am not a virus, I am a human, do not discriminate against me."
“实验”的内容是：姜啸站在弗洛伦萨市中心最繁华的几个地方，戴上口罩，蒙上双眼，将字牌放在身边，感受路人会对这样一个“奇怪的中国人”做出怎样的举动。
The "experiment" involved Mr. Jiang standing in one of Florence's most prosperous locations, wearing a mask, blindfolding and putting up signs to feel what passers-by would do to such a "strange Chinese."
拍摄刚开始，路人们驻足观看“我能不能帮你摘掉口罩和眼罩”第二天下午，姜啸和伙伴们就来到佛罗伦萨共和国广场，按照计划蒙上眼睛，戴上口罩站在广场中心。
At the beginning of the shoot, passersby stopped to watch "Can I take off your mask and blindfold" The next afternoon, Jiang and his companions arrived at the Republic Square in Florence, blindfolded and wearing masks as planned.
“戴口罩是代表中国。
"Wearing masks is for China.
在中国，现在大家都戴着口罩。
In China, people now wear masks.
戴眼罩是因为不想知道谁走过来，不去预知对方想要对我做什么。
I wear the blindfold because I don't want to know who is coming and what he or she wants to do to me.
”回忆起当天的行动，姜啸说自己当时有些紧张。
"Recalling the day's actions, Jiang said he was nervous.
当“全副武装”站定后，他感到一种未知的焦虑，“因为我不知道人们会对我做什么。
As he stood "fully armed," he felt an unknown anxiety, "because I don't know what people are going to do to me.
我们没有在字牌上写‘请你来拥抱我’这样的话。
We didn't write 'Please hug me' on the sign.
”当第一个人上来拥抱姜啸后，越来越多的人上前去拥抱他，姜啸的紧张感消失了。
When the first man came up and hugged Jiang, more and more people came to embrace him, and the tension died away.
紧接而来的是一种“幸福感”，“我觉得有其他人和我们想的一样，他们理解歧视是不对的。
Then came a sense of well-being. "I think there are other people who understand that discrimination is wrong, just as we think.
” 有人称赞他的行为并为他拍照，有人会询问疫情目前的形势，还有更多的人祝中国好运，并祝愿这场疫情早日结束。
He was praised and photographed, people would ask about the current situation, and many more wished China good luck and an early end to the epidemic.
令姜啸印象最深刻的是视频中的最后一个拥抱。
What impressed Jiang most was the last embrace in the video.
“那个男孩子走到我身边问：‘我能不能帮你摘掉口罩和眼罩？’我说，如果你同意我写的那些话，当然可以。
"The boy came up to me and asked, 'Can I take off your mask and blindfold for you?' I said, 'Sure, if you agree with what I've written.
然后他就帮我摘掉眼罩和口罩，然后抱住了我。
Then he took off my blindfold and mask and hugged me.
拿掉眼罩时，我才看见原来有好多人围着我们，在他拥抱我的时候，大家都鼓掌了。
When I took the blindfold off, I saw a lot of people around us. When he hugged me, everyone clapped.
”整个拍摄期间，姜啸没有感受到任何人对他表达恶意，也没听到不友好的声音。
Throughout the shooting, Jiang did not feel any ill will or unkind voice from anyone.
“也可能因为如果有人要说坏的话，不会专门凑到我跟前来说，怕我有病毒的人也压根不会在我面前停下来，所以那些离得远远的人是什么态度我并不知道。
"Or perhaps because someone who says something bad doesn't come up to me and says that someone who's afraid of my virus won't even stop in front of me, so I don't know what the attitude of those who are far away is.
”两个半小时的时间里，姜啸得到了四五十个拥抱，这超出了姜啸和伙伴们的预期。
In two and a half hours, Jiang received forty or fifty hugs, which exceeded the expectations of Jiang and his companions.
每一次拥抱过后，他都会向对方说一声“谢谢” 。
After each hug, he would say "thank you" to each other.
在姜啸看来，拥抱不是最重要的，“最重要是很多人理解了我的呼吁。
To Jiang, hugging is not the most important thing. "The most important thing is that many people understand my appeal.
所有在我面前停留的人，都是值得我去感谢的。
All who stay in front of me deserve my gratitude.
”Play姜啸和同伴们制作的视频“我突然就明白了你的处境”中意青年联合会在脸书上发布了姜啸和伙伴们制作的视频，发布一周后有40万次浏览、600多条评论、4686个赞、1781个喜欢、91个哭泣的表情。
A video produced by Play Ginger and his companions, "I suddenly understand your situation," showed the YMCA posting on Facebook videos produced by Jiang and partners, with 400,000 views, more than 600 reviews, 4,686 positive comments, 1,781 likes and 91 weeping expressions a week after its release.
有人在视频底下评论“中国加油，武汉加油”，也有人说，“我突然就明白了你的处境”，还有人反思了意大利的一些歧视事件。
Some people under the video comment "China refuels, Wuhan refuels," others say, "I suddenly understand your situation", and others reflect on some incidents of discrimination in Italy.
姜啸没想到他的视频受到了这么多的关注，“ 它发布之后我收到了很多人的支持。
Jiang did not expect so much attention for his video. "I got a lot of support after it was released."
很多人来给我留言说他们很感动，有的还哭了，其实我自己回头看视频的时候也挺感动的。
A lot of people came to leave a message to me that they were very moved, some still cry, in fact, I look back at the video when I am also very moved.
”就如一条评论所说的那样，“在真实世界中，好人还是占多数。
As one comment puts it, "in the real world, good people are still the majority.
”姜啸说，大多数意大利人不会做出歧视的行为。
Most Italians do not discriminate, says Jiang.
姜啸认为，新冠病毒虽是先出现在中国，但全世界要共同面对，这是所有人的损失，无论是意大利人还是中国人，“ 现在意大利旅游业受到打击，之前每天都有很多中国游客。
Jiang said the virus first appeared in China, but the whole world had to face it together. It was a loss for all, Italians and Chinese alike. "Now Italian tourism has been hit and there were a lot of Chinese tourists every day
这是一个全球的经济问题，比如之前有很多产品是由中国生产出口过来的，但现在因为疫情无法到货了。
This is a global economic problem. For example, a lot of products were exported from China before, but now it can't arrive because of the epidemic.
”在意大利，新冠肺炎疫情出现后，去中国餐厅用餐和中国商店购物的人数出现大量减少，有部分地区的官员为此主动前往中国街或中餐馆用餐以消除大众恐惧。
In Italy, after the outbreak of pneumonia in China, there has been a sharp drop in the number of people going to Chinese restaurants and Chinese shops, with some officials taking the initiative to go to Chinese streets or restaurants to allay fears.
在学校中出现对中国学生的偏见时，有华人家长会自发提供意大利语的病毒科普内容发给学生们阅读。
When prejudice against Chinese students appears in schools, some Chinese parents spontaneously offer Italian-language viral popular science content for students to read.
当地时间2月1日，意大利佛罗伦萨市长纳德拉(Dario Nardella)在推特上发起“给中国人一个拥抱”的话题，他鼓励意大利人理性看待疫情：“我们遵循卫生部门的指示并谨慎行事，但绝不鼓励心理恐怖主义，尤其是对那些迫不及待想要利用这一借口对中国公民进行仇恨和侮辱的人。
On Feb. 1, Italian Mayor Dario Nardella tweeted the topic "Give the Chinese a hug" and encouraged Italians to look at the epidemic rationally: "We follow the instructions of the health sector and act with caution, but we do not encourage psychological terrorism, especially against those who cannot wait to use this pretext to hatred and insult Chinese citizens."
在这场共同的战斗中，我们要团结起来！”姜啸认为，真正令人恐惧的并不是新冠病毒，而是散布在空气中的偏见。
In this common battle, we must unite! "Jiang said, the real fear is not the new crown virus, but the prejudice spread in the air.
