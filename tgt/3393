口述实录·火线虽然看起来我们把呼吸支持治疗、ECMO支持治疗都用上了，但最后没救回来，其实是支持手段用得太晚了。
Oral Reported Fire Although it appears that we used both respiratory support therapy and ECMO support therapy, it was too late to help.
从这些经验教训中我们知道，治疗关口要前移。
From these lessons we know that the treatment threshold has to move forward.
记者 |黄　祺最近，已经在武汉最前线工作40多天的东南大学附属中大医院党委副书记邱海波教授，完成了国家卫健委医疗救治专家组第五轮巡查工作。
Recently, Huang Qi, deputy secretary of the Communist Party Committee of Southeast University's Southeast University Hospital, who has worked for more than 40 days at the forefront of Wuhan, completed the fifth round of inspections by the National Health Commission's Medical Treatment Expert Group.
每到一家医疗机构，邱海波教授就会和负责新冠肺炎重症患者救治的同道一起，讨论救治难度大的病人情况，特别是死亡病例，要一个一个“复盘”。
Every time he visits a medical institution, Professor Qiu Haibo discusses the treatment of difficult patients, especially death cases, with his colleagues in charge of treating patients with severe cases of New Crown Pneumonia, one by one.
邱海波教授在疫情早期提出了“沉默性低氧血症”等重要的判断，为后续治疗方案的改进提供依据邱海波教授说，新冠肺炎疫情是新中国建立后最严重的一次传染病疫情，尽管武汉是一座医疗资源丰富的城市，依旧在重压下蒙受了巨大的损失。
Professor Qiu Haibo made important judgments such as "silent hypoxemia" in the early stage of the epidemic. He said the outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia was the most serious case of infectious disease since the founding of New China.
新冠肺炎是一种全新的疾病，再加上病毒传播能力太强，早期猛增的病人让医疗救治陷入困境——重症患者迅速增加，救治成功率低，给社会带来恐慌情绪。
New Crown Pneumonia, a completely new disease, combined with the virus's ability to spread, has left early-stage surges of patients struggling with medical treatment - a rapidly increasing number of patients with severe illnesses, low success rates, and a sense of social panic.
随着全国医疗队驰援、救治物资逐步到位，以及方舱医院的启用、社区管理的加强，到了疫情后期，重症患者救治成功率慢慢上升。
With the assistance of the national medical team, the gradual arrival of treatment materials, as well as the opening of the cabin hospital, community management, to the late stage of the epidemic, the success rate of serious patients treatment slowly increased.
将近2个月的时间过去，武汉开始迎来曙光，这样的结果已经是之前众多预测中最好的一种。
Nearly two months later, Wuhan began to usher in the dawn, such an outcome has been the best of many previous forecasts.
武汉新冠肺炎重症患者的救治中，重症医学专业人才发挥了极其重要的作用。
In the treatment of severe cases of Wuhan Xinguan Pneumonia, severe medical professionals play an extremely important role.
全国各地共11000多名重症医学医护人员，在武汉救治最严重的新冠肺炎病人。
More than 11,000 intensive care workers across the country treated the worst cases of pneumonia in Wuhan.
邱海波教授是我国第一位重症医学博士，从2003年非典疫情开始，2005年四川省猪链球菌病疫情、2009年甲型H1N1流感疫情、2013年H7N9禽流感疫情……每一场重大突发公共卫生事件中，他都作为重症医学专家，不仅直接参与救治患者，还为决策和救治提供了大量重要的建议。
Professor Qiu Haibo is the first doctor of severe medicine in China. Starting from SARS epidemic in 2003, he was an expert in severe medicine in every major public health emergency. He also provided a large number of important suggestions for decision-making and treatment.
新冠肺炎疫情里，邱海波教授也多次在专家会议上向中央指导组领导提出重要决策建议。
Professor Qiu Haibo also made important suggestions to the leadership of the Central Steering Group during the expert meetings during the New Crown Pneumonia outbreak.
邱海波教授（右）与北京协和医院重症医学专家杜斌教授在武汉工作，手里的面包是他们的午餐“武汉的医院里还有几千新冠肺炎患者，还有几百位重症患者未能脱离危险。
Professor Qiu Haibo (right) and Professor Du Bin, a specialist in severe medicine at Beijing Concorde Hospital, are working in Wuhan. The bread in their hands is their lunch.
”当全国很多地方的人开始卸下压力时，邱海波教授依然和所有的医护人员一样，未敢放松警惕。
Professor Qiu Hai-po, like all health-care workers, did not dare to let down his guard when people began to unwind in many parts of the country.
一边救治病人，邱海波教授一边总结疫情带来的启示。
While treating patients, Professor Qiu Haibo summarized the implications of the outbreak.
3月9日下午，邱海波教授接受了《新民周刊》的专访。
On the afternoon of March 9, Professor Qiu Haibo was interviewed by Xinmin Weekly.
“复盘”重症病人救治经验《新民周刊》：武汉全部方舱医院休舱，定点医院病床也开始空出来，武汉的疫情是不是可以说大为缓解？邱海波：方舱医院休舱，希望大家不要误解。
2006-03-15 09: 36: 48 Wuhan Hakata Hospital is closed and hospital beds are being emptied in Wuhan, is the situation in Wuhan greatly alleviated? Qiu Haibo: The cabin hospital is closed, I hope you don't misunderstand.
休舱不是永久性地关闭，接下来武汉要逐步启动复工复产，城市会逐步开放，如果未来再出现病人增加的情况，随时可以启用这些方舱医院。
The suspension is not permanent, then Wuhan will gradually start to resume work, the city will gradually open up, if there are more patients in the future, can be ready to use these cabin hospitals.
目前的情况看，定点医院里有空病床出来了，方舱医院这种临时、简易的医院可以暂时不用了。
As things stand, hospital beds are available at the designated hospital, and the temporary, improvised hospital, Fang Cao Hospital, can be temporarily eliminated.
之前武汉几乎所有的医院都用来收治新冠肺炎病人，现在定点医院里，有的病区关闭。
Wuhan, almost all of the hospitals used to treat patients with new crown pneumonia, now point to the hospital, some closed the area.
有的医院ICU病床空出一半，病床供大于求，是非常值得高兴的现象。
The fact that half of the hospital ICU beds are available and the number of beds exceeds the demand is very welcome.
我知道一些来得晚一点的医疗队，去替换来得早的医疗队，有一部分医护人员可以得到轮休。
I know some medical teams that come a little late to replace the medical teams that arrived earlier, and some of them get rotation breaks.
这些情况都说明疫情在缓解。
These are all indications that the epidemic is abating.
武汉的医院接下来要逐步恢复正常的医疗服务，为肿瘤病人、慢性肾衰等病人，以及心梗、脑梗、胆囊炎、阑尾炎等等急症病人提供服务。
Wuhan hospitals will gradually restore normal medical services for cancer patients, chronic renal failure and other patients, as well as myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, cholecystitis, appendicitis and other acute patients.
《新民周刊》：国家卫健委医疗救治专家组完成了第五轮巡查，这一次巡查主要是什么目的？邱海波：公众对新冠肺炎的病死率非常关注，这也是我们专家组特别关注的内容。
What is the main purpose of this visit? Qiu Haibo: The public is very concerned about the death rate of Newcomer Pneumonia, which is of particular concern to our Group of Experts.
第五轮巡查的重点，就是把之前死亡的病例拿出来讨论，一个一个“复盘”。
The focus of the fifth round of inspections is to bring out cases of previous deaths for discussion, one by one.
我们希望从这些救治的经验教训中，找到更好的救治经验，减少重症病人的死亡率。
We hope that from the experience of these treatments, we can find better treatment experience and reduce the mortality of patients with severe diseases.
我们之前已经用到了一些很好的经验，比如“关口前移”，有些救治措施要早点用上，效果会更好。
We have used some good experience before, such as "pass forward", some treatment measures should be used earlier, the effect will be better.
但我们也要客观地看到，新冠肺炎疫情是新中国建立后最严重的一次疫情，病毒传播太快。
But we should also objectively see that the New Crown Pneumonia outbreak is the most serious outbreak since the establishment of New China, the virus spread too quickly.
武汉的医疗资源很丰富，我们假设疫情发生在北京、上海，恐怕也面临着类似的救治压力。
Wuhan is rich in medical resources, we assume that the outbreak occurred in Beijing, Shanghai, I am afraid that the same treatment pressure.
所以早期病死率比较高，和病毒本身的特点有关系。
So the early mortality rate is higher, and the characteristics of the virus itself is related.
2003年非典疫情，全国只有几千病人。
There were only a few thousand cases of SARS in 2003.
而新冠肺炎疫情，2个月时间已经有8万多病人，早期就算有全国各地医疗队支援，救治都还是非常吃紧。
New crown pneumonia, two months has more than 80,000 patients, even with the support of medical teams around the country, the treatment is still very tight.
《新民周刊》：“复盘”的过程中，看到哪些问题？邱海波：早期的重症患者救治中，有些措施可能是有问题的。
What are some of the problems you see in the course of New People's Weekly's "Retroactive Disk"? Qiu Haibo: Some of the early treatments for the seriously ill may be problematic.
比如有的病人一采取插管通气心脏就停跳，哪有这个道理？一定是插管的时机太晚了。
For example, some patients take the intubation of the heart to stop, which reason? It must be too late for the intubation.
这个时候病人的心脏、肾脏等等都已经因为缺氧而损伤。
By this time the patient's heart, kidneys and so on have been damaged by lack of oxygen.
前期部分重症病人无创通气的时间太长，插管的时机太晚。
The time of noninvasive ventilation was too long in the early stage of severe patients, and the time of intubation was too late.
虽然看起来我们把呼吸支持治疗、ECMO支持治疗都用上了，但最后没救回来，其实是支持手段用得太晚了。
Although we seem to be using both respiratory support therapy and ECMO support therapy, we didn't get it back, but the support came too late.
从这些经验教训中我们知道，治疗关口要前移。
From these lessons we know that the treatment threshold has to move forward.
疫情早期，我们因为救治条件限制，出现了这些问题，不少病人给我们留下非常惨痛的教训。
In the early stage of the epidemic, we had these problems because of the limitation of treatment conditions, and many patients left us with very painful lessons.
后来我们救治条件好了，就应该按照规范来做。
Later, when the conditions for our treatment are good, we should follow the rules.
邱海波教授（右一）与杜斌、管向东等国内权威重症医学专家一起在新冠肺炎重症病房内工作《新民周刊》：您1月20日就到了武汉，早期救治是一个怎样的状态？邱海波：大家在媒体上也看到一些疫情早期的情况。
Professor Qiu Haibo (first from the right) works with Du Bin and Guang Xiang-dong, the leading domestic experts in severe cases of severe illness. "Xinmin Weekly": You arrived in Wuhan on January 20th.
当时病人猛增，一床难求，医院里ICU病床全满，重症科接到无数电话：这个病人不行了，能不能收进去？但ICU没有办法，收不进。
The ICU bed in the hospital was full, and the intensive care unit received numerous calls: This patient is no longer available, can you accept it? But the ICU has no choice.
这样的情况下，必须扩床，二十张、三十张根本没用，开出来马上就住满。
In such a case, the bed must be enlarged, twenty, thirty, no use at all, come out immediately full.
看到这样的情况，我们专家组向中央指导组建议，要迅速增加集中收治重症患者的定点医院，迅速扩充重症病床，这个意见很快被采纳。
In view of this, our group of experts recommended to the Central Steering Group to rapidly increase the number of designated hospitals for the intensive care of critically ill patients and to rapidly expand the number of critically ill beds, an idea that was quickly adopted.
征用的医院被整个改造成收治重症患者的病区，然而光有病床也没有用，这个时候全国各地的医疗队来支援了。
The requisitioned hospital was completely converted into a sick area for critically ill patients, yet beds alone were not available, when medical teams from all over the country came to support them.
把十多家医院征用来全部收治传染病病人，这种做法也是从来没有过的。
More than a dozen hospitals have been requisitioned to treat all patients with infectious diseases, a practice never seen before.
《新民周刊》：早期一些病人插管通气时机太晚，是不是还有客观的原因？邱海波：早期疫情暴发时，重症病人太多，ICU床位不够，病人进不了ICU，不能插管。
Is there an objective reason why some early patients were too late to intubate? Qiu Haibo: There were too many serious cases in the early outbreak, there were not enough ICU beds, patients could not get into ICU and they could not intubate.
另外，就算能做插管，最开始几天氧气压力不够，装备不到位，插管也没有用。
In addition, even if you can do intubation, the first few days of oxygen pressure is not enough, equipment is not in place, intubation is not useful.
还有一个原因是，最早我们医生的防护物资都不够，要么是没有，要么达不到防护级别，你让医生怎么做插管？医护人员也恐惧啊。
Another reason is that none of our doctors had enough protection, either not at all or not at all. How did you ask your doctor to do the intubation?
2003年非典中，很多医护人员就是在防护不到位的情况下给病人插管，造成了感染。
In 2003, SARS, many health care workers in the absence of protection in the case of patients intubation, resulting in infection.
当然，后来我们发现，一些非重症医学专业的医生，对插管通气的感染风险认识上也有误区。
Of course, we later found that some non-intensive medical doctors, the risk of infection through intubation is also misunderstood.
有的医生认为插管通气比无创通气对于医护人员的感染风险更大，其实不是的，无创通气的气体流量要比插管通气高很多，理论上无创通气的感染风险更高。
Some doctors believe that intubation is a greater risk for health care workers than non-invasive ventilation. In fact, noninvasive gas flow is much higher than intubation, and the theoretical risk of non-invasive ventilation is higher.
邱海波教授组织重症患者救治《新民周刊》：您做了30年重症医学专业，见了很多生死，到武汉的最初几天，是一种什么感受？邱海波：有人说，医生都有“情感过滤器”，很多人以为我们医生每天都要面对死亡，所以看到病人死亡无所谓。
What's your feeling in the first few days in Wuhan? Qiu Haibo: Some people say that doctors have "emotional filters," and many people think our doctors have to face death every day, so it doesn't matter if you see a patient dying.
其实不是，医生也是人，无能为力时也会感到绝望。
Not really. Doctors are human beings. They feel desperate when they can't.
我刚到的时候，晚上去查房的病房，第二天就走了三个病人。
When I first arrived, I went to the room to check in the evening and left three patients the next day.
这样的情况我能接受吗？完全不能接受，打击很大。
Can I accept such a situation? It is totally unacceptable and very devastating.
为什么会这样？当时很多救治条件都没有，病人需要吸氧，但氧气压力不够，呼吸机打不起来。
Why? At that time, many treatment conditions are not available, patients need oxygen, but oxygen pressure is not enough, breathing machine can not play.
我把这些困难向上反映，反映到中央指导组，后来这些问题都得到了解决。
I reflected these difficulties upward, as reflected in the Central Steering Group, and these issues were subsequently resolved.
医生不可能把所有病人都救回来，但我们都希望能尽最大的努力救病人。
Doctors can't get all the patients back, but we all want to do our best to save them.
逐渐认识新冠肺炎：沉默性低氧血症《新民周刊》：您很早就提出，新冠肺炎的特点是“沉默性低氧血症”，后来再回头看这些重病人，是否印证了当时的判断？邱海波：是的。
New Crown Pneumonia: Silent Hypoxemia: You have long argued that New Crown Pneumonia is characterized by "silent hypoxemia," and later look back at these seriously ill people to see if it confirms the judgment of the timeQiu Haibo: Yes.
我们常常听到临床医生说，这个病人前一天还好好的，突然就不行了。
We often hear clinicians say that the patient was doing well the day before, and suddenly he was out of it.
我早期在病人身上已经发现了这个现象。
I found this phenomenon early on in patients.
以往我们遇到的重症病人，如果他血氧饱和度降低，人会感觉难受，憋气，心率会加快。
In severe cases we have encountered in the past, if his blood oxygen saturation decreases, people will feel uncomfortable, suffocate, heart rate will accelerate.
去过西藏的人都有这种体会，高原缺氧，那么你心脏会怦怦跳。
People who have been to Tibet have this experience, the plateau hypoxia, then your heart will pounding.
有这些症状，医生会及时去测血氧，及时给他进行治疗，解决血氧饱和度低的问题。
These symptoms, the doctor will be timely blood oxygen measurement, prompt treatment to him, solve the problem of low blood oxygen saturation.
可是新冠肺炎病人，他自己主诉不明显，就是说他自己感觉没有太难受，他会说有点憋气，但不是太严重。
But the new Crown Pneumonia patient, his own complaint is not obvious, that is to say he does not feel too uncomfortable, he would say a little suffocating, but not too serious.
如果医生这个时候去测，会发现他的血氧饱和其实已经很低了。
If the doctor were to take a test at this time, he would find that the oxygen saturation of his blood was already very low.
这个就是我说的“沉默性低氧血症”。
This is what I call "silent hypoxemia."
早期，我们对这个现象认识不足，有的治疗手段用得太晚，比如说插管通气用得太晚，等用上去的时候已经来不及了。
In the early days, we were under-informed about this phenomenon, and some treatments were used too late, such as venting the tube too late to use.
这个是我们认识一种新疾病的过程。
This is the process by which we recognize a new disease.
《新民周刊》：摸索新冠肺炎重症患者的治疗方法，非常艰难吗？邱海波：头一个月摸索治疗方法的过程是相当艰苦的。
NEWSWEEK: How hard is it to find a cure for serious cases of Newcomin Pneumonia? Qiu Haibo: The first month of groping for a cure can be hard.
我们找到了一些很有效的措施。
We have found some very effective measures.
比如我提出“俯卧位通气”的方法，让病人趴着，“俯卧位通气”可以利用重力作用引流病人气管里的分泌物，对于病人血氧饱和的恢复有帮助。
For example, I propose the "prone position ventilation" method, which allows patients to lie on their stomach and use gravity to drain secretions from their trachea, which can help patients recover from oxygen saturation.
《新民周刊》：您讲的“关口前移”，包含哪些内容？邱海波：我们说的“关口前移”，指的是找到轻症变重症，重症变危重症这个转变过程中的关键点，及时地却切断这个发展。
Qiu Haibo: When we talk about "turning the corner forward," we mean finding the critical point in the transition from mild to severe, from severe to critical, and cutting off that development in time.
特别是危重症患者，我们发现新冠病毒对人体的伤害，涉及肺、心脏、肠道等等重要的器官，应该把它看做“新冠病毒感染症”。
Especially in critically ill patients, we found that the new crown virus damage to the human body, involving lung, heart, intestinal and other important organs, should be regarded as "new crown virus infection."
无论是对肺部症状的控制还是其他器官症状的控制，都要措施前移。
Whether the control of lung symptoms or other organ symptoms, measures should be taken to move forward.
重症医学根基还不够牢《新民周刊》：国家卫健委医疗救治专家组在新冠肺炎疫情中起到了怎样的作用？邱海波：专家组有几个作用。
The foundation of serious medicine is not yet firmly rooted in Xinmin Weekly: What role did the National Health Council's medical team play in the outbreak of pneumonia? Qiu Haibo: The panel has several roles to play.
第一个是到病区担任医疗组长，领导和参与重症患者的救治。
The first is to serve as a medical team leader in the affected area, leading and participating in the treatment of critically ill patients.
第二个是指导救治，我们有定期巡查制度，去各个救治组看一些重点病人，进行病例讨论，研究救治方案。
The second is guidance and treatment, we have regular inspection system, go to each treatment group to see some key patients, case discussion, research treatment plan.
第三个是很重要的任务：我们通过查房，看病人，总结救治中的经验教训，把这些临床经验总结到新冠肺炎诊疗方案中。
The third task is very important: we can review the room, see the patient, summarize the experience of treatment, summarize these clinical experience into the new crown pneumonia diagnosis and treatment program.
至今诊疗方案已经更新到第七版，效率是很高的。
To date, the programme has been upgraded to version 7, which is highly efficient.
邱海波教授白天在医院指导救治，晚上总结经验并与同行专家交流汇总《新民周刊》：这次疫情，您认为我们要总结哪些经验？邱海波：我是临床医生，我的工作是救治病人。
What experience do you think we should draw from this outbreak? Qiu Haibo: I am a clinician and my job is to treat patients.
如果一场传染病疫情发生后，所有的期待都放在ICU，到了ICU 这个生命最后一道防线的地方，把压力放在这个地方，那是下策。
If, after an epidemic occurs, all expectations are set on the ICU, the last line of defense in life, it would be a bad idea to put pressure on the place.
应对传染病疫情的上策，是防和控先做好，在这个基础上，得了病的人我们要救治好。
The best way to deal with epidemic diseases is to prevent and control them well. On this basis, we should treat those who are ill.
如果防和控做好了，病人数量就不会那么多，病人基数小了，那么重症人就会少，死亡率就不会那么高。
If prevention and control were in place, the number of patients would be less, the patient base would be smaller, the number of patients would be less severe and the death rate would be less.
因此我觉得未来一定要加强公共卫生力量。
So I think we must strengthen public health in the future.
《新民周刊》：从救治的角度，有什么启示？邱海波：从救治的角度来说，我们过去都有突发公共卫生事件的应急预案，但当这么大的疫情发生，我们发现过去的预案都不顶用。
What are the implications from the perspective of medical treatmentQiu Haibo: From the medical point of view, we all had contingency plans for public health emergencies in the past, but when such an outbreak occurred, we found that past plans were ineffective.
这说明我们的预案站位还不够高，没有考虑到严重的情况。
This shows that our plan is not high enough to take into account the serious situation.
我认为突发公共卫生事件的应急预案，要有顶层设计。
I think emergency preparedness for public health emergencies requires top-level design.
比如说，如果发生低强度传染病疫情，应该怎么应对；中等强度的传染病疫情，应该怎么应对；高强度的传染病疫情，又该怎么办。
For example, if a low-intensity epidemic occurs, what should be done to deal with it; what to do with an epidemic of moderate intensity; and what to do with a high-intensity epidemic?
要按照几个层面，来做传染病疫情的预案。
We should plan the epidemic according to several levels.
重症医学专业1万多名医护人员在湖北参与救治，占所有医疗支援人员三分之一《新民周刊》：您是重症医学专家，疫情中全国1万多名重症科医护人员援助武汉，为什么您认为重症医学人才的储备还是不够？邱海波：支援湖北的重症医学人才，大概占全国重症医学人才的10%。
You are an expert in severe medicine and more than 10,000 intensive care workers all over the country have helped Wuhan. Why do you think the reserve of medical personnel for serious diseases is still insufficient? Qiu Haibo: Support Hubei's critical medical personnel, who make up about 10% of the country's critical medical personnel.
全国来武汉的医疗队中，各个科室的医生都有，我们发现，救治重症患者时，对于其他科的医生来说，就特别难。
Wuhan medical team, all the departments of doctors, we found that the treatment of serious patients, for other doctors, is particularly difficult.
他们有心杀敌，但手上的武器不够。
They wanted to kill the enemy, but they didn't have enough weapons on their hands.
重症病人的救治，不能靠激情，必须要技术和方法，而这些技术不是说短期培训就能学会的。
The treatment of severe patients, not by passion, but by technology and methods, and these technologies can not be said to be short-term training.
最近我向国家卫健委相关领导建议，要把重症医学纳入住院医师规培体系中。
Recently, I suggested to the relevant leaders of the National Health Commission that severe medicine should be included in the resident training system.
重症医学是唯一没有纳入住院医师规培体系的二级学科，我们只有专科医师培训，一年全国也就培养几百个人。
Grave medicine is the only secondary subject that is not included in the resident training system. We only have specialist training, and hundreds of people are trained nationwide in a year.
这就好像金字塔，我们塔尖上有人才，但金字塔底是没有培养体系的，这个学科没有根基。
It's like a pyramid, we have talent on the spire, but there is no culture system at the bottom of the pyramid. This discipline has no foundation.
征集令阳春三月，万物复苏。
Call for Spring March, all things revive.
在抗击疫情的战斗中，我们迎来了春天，《新民周刊》也迎来了新闻线索和故事征集的第二弹。
In the fight against the epidemic, we ushered in the spring, "New People's Weekly" also ushered in the news clues and the second round of story collection.
如今，经历了一个多月休眠的城市正在逐渐苏醒，各行各业都开始有序复工复产。
Now, after more than a month of dormancy of the city is gradually waking up, all walks of life began to orderly resumption of work.
不论您是企业老板、管理者，还是普通员工；又或者，您是老师、家长，还是学生本人……我们希望了解复工复产复学过程中的困难，或暖心故事。
Whether you're a business owner, a manager, or an employee, or whether you're a teacher, parent, or student... we'd like to know about the difficulties of getting back to work, or a warm heart story.
