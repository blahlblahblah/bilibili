澎湃新闻记者 杨喆浙江一家企业捐赠给湖北团风县公安局的4万只口罩运输途中被侵占一事有了最新进展。
Zhe Yang, a journalist in Peng Pai, Zhejiang province, who donated 40,000 masks to the Hubei Tuanfeng County Public Security Bureau was recently overrun.
2月22日下午，湖北仙桃市公安局发布通告，经过专班民警的侦查，犯罪嫌疑人张某某在警方的攻势和压力下，已于22日投案自首，并退还了全部口罩货款。
On the afternoon of February 22, the Hubei Xiantao Public Security Bureau issued a notice, after specialized police investigation, suspect Zhang in the police offensive and pressure, surrendered on the 22nd, and returned all the money for masks.
谁侵占了4万只口罩？2月15日，杭州贝贝集团有限公司委托湖北仙桃的个体商人陈豪代为在当地采购4万只口罩，捐赠给黄冈市团风县公安局和红安县人民医院。
On Feb. 15, Hangzhou Beibei Group Limited commissioned Chen Hao, an individual businessman based in Hubei province, to purchase 40,000 masks for local purchase, donating them to the Tuanfeng County Public Security Bureau and the Hongan People's Hospital.
当天，贝贝集团一次性向陈豪指定的账户上转账19万元。
On the same day, Beibei Group to Chen Hao a one-time account transfer 190,000 yuan.
16日，在黄冈当地志愿者的帮助下，贝贝集团从团风县疫情防控指挥部开出了一张口罩运输的车辆通行证，通行证注明由司机张涛驾驶鄂A5N26N空车从武汉前往仙桃，运送4万只口罩，通行时间为2月16日至17日。
On February 16, with the help of local volunteers in Huanggang, the Beibei Group issued a vehicle pass for the transportation of masks from Tuanfeng County Command of Disease Control, which indicated that the driver, Zhang Tao, drove A5N26N empty from Wuhan to Xiantao and transported 40,000 masks from February 16 to 17.
实际运输口罩的司机给志愿者的短信回复 本文图片均由受访者提供2月19日，黄冈当地志愿者和贝贝集团方面向澎湃新闻（www.thepaper.cn）反馈，17日贝贝集团安排在武汉接货的司机一直等到凌晨2点也未等到从仙桃过来运送口罩的货车。
Huanggang local volunteers and Beibei Group provided feedback to the surging news (www.thepper.cn) on Feb. 19, and drivers arranged by Beibei Group to pick up the goods in Wuhan did not wait until 2 a. m. for the delivery of masks from the peach truck.
按照采购中间人提供的电话号码，贝贝集团和黄冈当地的志愿者多次联系当天承运的货车司机，但发车后司机就不再接听他们的电话了。
Local volunteers from Beibei Group and Huanggang repeatedly contacted truck drivers on the day of delivery, according to telephone numbers provided by procurement intermediaries, but drivers stopped answering their calls when they left.
“后来好不容易他回了短信，就是不承认运了4万只口罩的事情，只强调车上的口罩是自己花50万元买的。
"Later, he returned the message, denying that he had shipped 40,000 masks, stressing that he had bought them for half a million yuan.
”负责在黄冈当地对接的志愿者吕小姐告诉记者。
"In charge of the local Huanggang docking volunteers, Miss Lu told reporters.
19日，团风县公安局警务保障室主任王文成在澎湃新闻记者采访时表示，接到捐助方和志愿者的反映后，团风县公安局非常重视。
On the 19th, Wang Wencheng, director of the police support office of Tian Feng County Public Security Bureau, said in an interview with Peng Pai journalists that after receiving the response from donors and volunteers, the Tian Feng County Public Security Bureau attached great importance to it.
18日局里指派他和另一位民警赶往仙桃市公安局与当地警方协商处理此事。
18, the bureau assigned him and another civilian police to Xiantao City Public Security Bureau to negotiate with the local police to deal with the matter.
王文成告诉记者，这批4万只口罩在物资仓库并没有出库凭证。
Wang Wencheng told reporters that the 40, 000 masks in the warehouse did not come out of the certificate.
在仙桃当地，他们走访了采购中间人陈豪并找到了负责搬运口罩的装卸工人，工人向团风警方证实，他们一共将19万只口罩搬上了运输货车。
In the peach area, they visited the procurement middleman Chen Hao and found the stevedores in charge of the mask removal. The workers confirmed to Mission Police that they had carried a total of 190,000 masks onto the trucks.
团风县疫情指挥部原先为张涛开具的车辆通行证2月22日，仙桃市公安局宣传科相关负责人告诉澎湃新闻，16日原定由张涛驾驶鄂A5N26N货车从武汉前往仙桃的物资仓库运输4万只口罩。
The head of the propaganda department of Xiantao Public Security Bureau told Pai Pai that 40, 000 face masks were to be transported from Wuhan to Xiantao in a truck driven by Zhang Tao on February 16.
团风县疫情防控指挥部印发的通行证也写明是由张涛负责运输，但当天实际承运这批口罩的并不是张涛，而是嫌疑人张某某。
Mission Control and Prevention Command issued by the Mission is also issued by Zhang Tao transport, but the day of the actual carrying of this mask is not Zhang Tao, but suspect Zhang so.
该负责人告诉记者，嫌疑人张某某当天正好也前往同一物资仓库运输其他货主购买的15万只口罩，因为目的地也在武汉，仓库对接人就请张某某一并运输贝贝集团的4万只口罩，并告诉了采购中间人陈豪。
The person in charge told reporters that suspect Zhang so-and-so also went to the same warehouse to transport 150,000 masks purchased by other cargo owners, because the destination was also in Wuhan, the warehouse operator asked Zhang to transport the group's 40,000 masks, and told the procurement intermediary Chen Hao.
陈豪于是致电正在来仙桃途中的张涛，张涛接到陈豪的电话通知后便折返回武汉，他所驾驶的鄂A5N26N的货车也就没有在仙桃下高速。
Chen Hao then called Zhang Tao on his way to Xiantao. Zhang Tao received a telephone call from Chen Hao and turned back to Wuhan.
志愿者吕小姐表示，由于贝贝集团在湖北仙桃当地的采购对接人陈豪此前未明确告知货车司机已变更为张某某，他们一直认为是张涛驾驶鄂A5N26N货车运走了4万只口罩。
Volunteers Lu said that because Beibei Group in Hubei Xiantao local procurement docker Chen Hao has not clearly informed the truck driver has changed to Zhang, they have been driving the Hubei A5N26N truck to transport 40,000 masks.
团风县公安局警务保障室主任王文成也告诉记者，团风县疫情防控指挥部通行证上写明是由张涛运输口罩，且张涛和嫌疑人张某某同姓。
Tuanfeng County Public Security Bureau Police Support Office Director Wang Wencheng also told reporters, Tuanfeng county epidemic control command pass is said to be Zhang Tao transport masks, and Zhang Tao and suspect Zhang same surname.
一开始他们也误以为张涛就是运输司机。
At first they also mistakenly thought that Zhang Tao was the transport driver.
但后来经过仙桃警方的调查，张涛和鄂A5N26N的货车并未参与运输贝贝集团的4万只口罩，实际运输方换成了张某某。
However, after investigation by the Xiantao police, Zhang Tao and A5N26N's truck was not involved in the transport of the Beibei Group's 40,000 masks, the actual transportation party changed to Zhang.
仙桃市公安局宣传科相关负责人表示，案件专班开展侦查后，很快锁定了嫌疑人张某某。
Xiantao Public Security Bureau propaganda section of the relevant officials said that the case after the investigation, quickly targeted suspects Zhang.
在警方的心理攻势下，张某某最终供述了自己侵吞贝贝集团捐赠的4万只口罩一事。
In the police psychological offensive, Zhang finally confessed to his embezzlement Beibei Group donated 40,000 masks.
嫌疑人在22日下午14时已经向仙桃警方投案自首，并退还了全部货款，目前案件正在进一步办理中。
The suspect surrendered to the police in Sendai at 14: 00 pm on the 22nd, and returned the full amount of the money, the case is now being further processed.
误会消除，企业继续履行捐赠承诺2月22日下午，张涛对澎湃新闻表示，16日晚10点他接到朋友的电话，请他去仙桃运送贝贝集团捐赠的4万只口罩回武汉，由于公司其他员工白天已经跑了多趟运输，非常疲惫，于是他便亲自驾驶货车从武汉出发赶往仙桃。
Zhang Tao told Peng Pai News on the afternoon of Feb. 16 that he had received a call from a friend asking him to return to Wuhan with 40,000 masks donated by the Beibei Group. As the rest of the company had already travelled many times during the day and was very tired, he drove the van from Wuhan to Xiantao.
但当天他确实没有到仙桃，接到对接人电话后就中途折返了。
But that day he did not arrive at the peach, received a call to the caller on the way back.
此前被误认为是侵占口罩的嫌疑人，张涛表示自己很委屈。
Previously was misunderstood to be encroaching on the mask suspect, Zhang Tao said he was very aggrieved.
张涛（右）张涛告诉记者，疫情发生后，作为武汉市美慧物流公司的负责人，他自发成立了爱心车队运输抗疫物资。
Zhang Tao (right) told reporters that after the outbreak, as the head of Wuhan Mei Hui logistics company, he spontaneously set up a love convoy to transport anti-epidemic materials.
由于经常参与公益活动，他的电话号码也被转发到了各种聊天群里，疫情期间有防护物资需要运送很多人都会主动联系他。
As a result of his frequent involvement in public service activities, his telephone number was relayed to various chat groups and many people contacted him when there was a need to transport protective equipment during the outbreak.
据《楚天都市报》报道，武汉疫情加重后，张涛从河南老家返回武汉，组建了爱心车队，公司47台车全部加入爱心车队，有10多台车是张涛自己的，其余都是兄弟们自愿加盟的。
After the Wuhan epidemic worsened, Zhang Tao returned to Wuhan from his hometown of Henan and set up a team of 47 cars, all of which joined the team, with more than 10 cars belonging to Zhang Tao himself, while the rest were voluntarily joined by his brothers, the Chu Tian Metropolitan Daily reported.
他贴车贴人，还贴了12万的油费，被车队队员们称为“傻子队长”。
He put up stickers and a 120,000-dollar gas bill, which the team members described as the "stupid captain."
杭州贝贝集团公关部相关负责人表示，22日下午仙桃警方已经通过银行向贝贝集团账户转回了4万只口罩的货款。
Hangzhou Beibei Group, the public relations department said the 22 afternoon Xiantao police through the bank account to the Beibei Group back the purchase of 40,000 masks.
虽然货款被追回，但贝贝集团经过研究决定，继续履行原先的承诺，仍旧向团风县公安局等单位捐助4万只口罩。
Although the money was recovered, Beibei Group decided to continue to fulfil the original commitment, Tian Feng County Public Security Bureau and other units donated 40,000 masks.
由于企业仓库中一次性口罩仅剩1万余只，贝贝集团决定剩余部分用此前在国外采购的KF94口罩代替，4万只口罩预计在23日便可从杭州发出。
With only about 10,000 disposable masks left in its corporate warehouse, Beibei decided to replace the remainder with KF94 masks previously purchased abroad, with 40,000 expected to be sent from Hangzhou on the 23rd.
