澎湃新闻记者 张若婷 贺梨萍新冠肺炎疫情暴发以来，各国科研团队对其飞沫、接触、气溶胶等传播途径高度关注， “能否感染结膜”也一度引发热议。
Zhang Ruoting news reporters Ho Liping new crown pneumonia outbreak, the international scientific research team on its droplet, contact, aerosol and other means of transmission, "whether the infection conjunctiva" has also triggered a heated debate.
当地时间2月11日，武汉大学人民医院陈长征研究组于预印本网站medRxiv（未经同行评议）发表论文称，通过分析67例确诊或疑似新冠肺炎病例，临床数据并不支持新冠病毒（2019-nCoV）可通过结膜途径传播。
The clinical data do not support the conjunctival transmission of the new crown virus (2019-nCoV) through an analysis of 67 confirmed or suspected cases of new crown pneumonia, according to a paper released on the pre-printed website medRxiv (not peer-reviewed) by the Chen Changzheng Research Group of Wuhan University People's Hospital.
值得一提的是，此前，国家卫健委专家组成员、北京大学第一医院呼吸和危重症医学科主任王广发于1月8日至1月15日前往武汉工作，随后1月21日确诊新冠病毒感染。
It should be noted that Wang Guangfa, a member of the group of experts of the National Health Care Commission and director of respiratory and critical medicine at Peking University Hospital No. 1, travelled to Wuhan from January 8 to January 15 to work.
1月22日，他发微博推测自己感染新型冠状病毒的途径：高度怀疑是病毒先进入眼结膜，而后再到全身。
On January 22, he tweeted out his route to the new coronavirus: there was a strong suspicion that the virus had entered the conjunctiva first, then the entire body.
王广发微博截图对此，陈长征团队对该院2020年1月17日至1月28日收治的67例确诊或疑似新冠肺炎病例进行了回顾分析，团队认为，新冠肺炎患者的结膜囊中可以检测到新冠病毒，但临床分析数据不支持新冠病毒通过结膜途径传播。
In response, Chen's team reviewed 67 cases of confirmed or suspected new crown pneumonia admitted to the hospital from January 17 to January 28, 2020. The team concluded that the coronavirus could be detected in the conjunctival sac of patients with Newly Coronary Pneumonia, but clinical data did not support the transmission of the new crown virus through conjunctival channels.
该研究还表示，良好的临床保护措施可以有效地切断传播途径。
The study also showed that good clinical protection measures can effectively cut off transmission pathways.
67例确诊或疑似新冠肺炎病例分析这些患者多数是医护人员，尤其是女性护士。
Analysis of 67 Cases of Confirmed or Suspected Newly Coronary Pneumonia Most of these patients were medical staff, especially female nurses.
患者包括男性25名、女性42名，中位年龄35.7岁（年龄范围22-78岁）。
The patients included 25 males and 42 females, with a median age of 35.7 years (age range 22-78).
团队收集了患者的鼻咽和结膜拭子用于实时RT-PCR（逆转录-聚合酶链反应）分析，以检测新型冠状病毒。
The team collected nasal and conjunctival swabs from patients for real-time RT-PCR analysis to detect the new coronavirus.
研究人员发现，在67例病例中，仅有一名新冠肺炎患者的结膜拭子样本得到阳性PCR结果，2名患者的PCR结果可能是阳性。
The researchers found that in 67 cases, only one patient with Newly Coronary Pneumonia had positive PCR results in conjunctival swabbing, and in two patients the PCR was probably positive.
但是，这3名患者均无眼部症状。
However, none of the three patients had eye symptoms.
截至1月28日，67人中的63名患者被确诊为新冠肺炎，其余4名为疑似新冠肺炎。
As at 28 January, 63 of the 67 patients had been diagnosed with Newcomial Pneumonia and the remaining 4 were suspected to be New Crown Pneumonia.
仅有的1名以结膜炎为首发症状的新冠肺炎患者的结膜囊测试为阴性。
The only patient with nosocomial pneumonia with conjunctivitis as the first symptom tested negative for conjunctivitis.
4名疑似新冠肺炎病例（2男2女）的结膜拭子样本均为阴性。
Negative conjunctival swabbing samples were found in four cases of suspected new crown pneumonia (two men and two women).
团队使用实时RT-PCR分析对这些拭子样品进行进一步的实验室新冠病毒检测。
The team used real-time RT-PCR analysis to carry out further laboratory testing of the swab samples.
实验方案为：从结膜拭子和鼻咽拭子中提取RNA，随后进行一步反转录偶联PCR反应，使用包含DNA结合染料和热循环仪的专有预混液。
RNA was extracted from a conjunctival swab and a nasopharyngeal swab, followed by a one-step reverse transcription PCR reaction, using a proprietary premixed solution containing DNA-binding dyes and thermal cycling instruments.
对于新冠病毒感染，该研究中实验室确诊的标准为：使用病毒分离、下一代测序或RT-PCR分析，发现呼吸道样本中至少一项阳性结果。
For new crown virus infections, laboratory-confirmed criteria in the study were the use of virus isolation, next-generation sequencing, or RT-PCR analysis to find at least one positive result in a respiratory sample.
疑似病例的确定标准为：有发烧或其他下呼吸道疾病的症状（如咳嗽或呼吸急促），白细胞计数低或正常或淋巴细胞计数低，经过抗菌治疗3天后症状未减轻，还考虑并纳入了流行病学暴露史。
Suspected cases are determined by symptoms of fever or other lower respiratory diseases (such as cough or shortness of breath), low or normal leukocyte counts or low lymphocyte counts, no reduction in symptoms after three days of antimicrobial treatment, and consideration and inclusion of an epidemiological exposure history.
结膜拭子样本为阳性/可疑阳性/以结膜炎为首发症状的患者信息结膜拭子样本为阳性的病例（患者8）为一名58岁的男性，他是院前急诊小组的一名急救车司机。
Conjunctival swabbing samples were positive / suspected positive / patients with conjunctivitis as the first sign of information Conjunctivitis positive (patient 8) was a 58-year-old male who was an ambulance driver for the pre-hospital emergency team.
在因发烧和咳嗽住院后，其胸部CT检查显示为病毒性肺炎，鼻咽和结膜拭子均对新冠病毒核酸测试呈阳性。
After hospitalization for fever and cough, his chest CT scan revealed viral pneumonia, and both nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs tested positive for the new crown virus nucleic acid.
他没有眼部不适，有与隔离患者的无保护接触史。
He has no eye discomfort and no history of unprotected contact with isolated patients.
结膜拭子样本可能为阳性的一名病例（患者24）为男性，现年78岁，有肺癌病史，有脑转移、慢性阻塞性肺炎和高血压。
A potentially positive case of conjunctival swabbing (patient 24) was a 78-year-old man with a history of lung cancer, brain metastases, chronic obstructive pneumonia and hypertension.
他因咳嗽、咳痰和气喘入院。
He was hospitalized with coughing, coughing and wheezing.
其新冠病毒的RNA测试结果显示，鼻咽拭子为阳性，结膜拭子为可疑阳性。
RNA tests of its new crown virus showed a positive nasopharyngeal swab and a suspected positive conjunctival swab.
他没有眼部不适，存在与新冠肺炎隐性携带者的接触史，该隐性携带者随后也被诊断患有新冠肺炎，并已住院。
He did not have eye problems and had a history of contact with the recessive carriers of Newcastle Pneumonia, who were subsequently diagnosed with Newcastle Pneumonia and hospitalized.
另一名结膜拭子样本可能为阳性的患者（患者30）是一名29岁的女性，怀孕36周。
Another patient with a potentially positive conjunctival swab sample (patient 30) was a 29-year-old woman who was 36 weeks pregnant.
她是一名医生，因发烧入院。
She was a doctor and was hospitalized with a fever.
新冠病毒的RNA测试结果显示，其鼻咽拭子为阳性，结膜拭子为可疑阳性。
RNA tests of the new crown virus showed a positive nasopharyngeal swab and a suspected positive conjunctival swab.
她没有眼疾，与确诊的新冠肺炎患者有接触史。
She has no eye problems and has a history of contact with people diagnosed with Newcomial Pneumonia.
患者30和她的3个同事（患者28，46和65）均被同一新冠肺炎病人感染。
Patients 30 and three of her colleagues (28, 46, and 65) were all infected with the same coronary pneumonia.
样本中6名因病人而感染的医生（下文中的患者41，10，40号和前文的患者28，46和65）的结膜拭子测试均为阴性，因此，与结膜的临时气雾接触传播病毒得不到临床支持。
Six of the patient-infected doctors (41, 10, 40, and 28, 46, and 65 above) tested negative for conjunctival swab tests, so that transmission of the virus in contact with temporary conjunctival aerosol is not clinically supported.
患者41为48岁女性，是麻醉师。
The patient was a 48-year-old woman, an anesthesiologist.
她因发烧、咳嗽、眼睛发红、发痒且有分泌物入院。
She was admitted to hospital with fever, cough, red eyes, itching and secretions.
新冠病毒RNA测试结果表明，其鼻咽拭子为阳性，而结膜拭子为阴性。
The results of RNA testing showed that the nasal swabs were positive and the conjunctival swabs negative.
她的最初症状是结膜炎，但眼部症状轻微，不用药物可自行缓解眼睛不适。
Her initial symptoms were conjunctivitis, but the eye symptoms were mild and did not require medication to relieve discomfort.
她曾戴着外科口罩与一名新冠肺炎确诊患者接触，但她当时没有戴防护镜。
She had been wearing a surgical mask and had been in contact with a newly diagnosed patient with pneumonia, but she was not wearing protective goggles.
患者41在为病人进行插管麻醉后，出现了眼部症状，随后出现发烧和咳嗽。
The patient developed symptoms of the eye following intubation anaesthesia, followed by fever and cough.
在麻醉期间，该麻醉师仅戴着普通的外科口罩、帽子和手套，没有穿戴护目镜、防护服或其他防护装置。
During the anesthesia, the anesthesiologist was wearing only ordinary surgical masks, hats and gloves and did not wear goggles, protective clothing or other protective devices.
为该新冠肺炎患者进行手术的两名外科医生（患者10和40）随后被诊断为新冠肺炎。
Two surgeons (patients 10 and 40) who operated on the patient were later diagnosed with Newcrown Pneumonia.
这两位医生没有眼部不适。
The two doctors have no eye discomfort.
值得注意的是，全身麻醉涉及气管插管，可能会增加病毒感染的风险。
It is worth noting that general anesthesia involves endotracheal intubation, which may increase the risk of viral infection.
患者结膜囊中能检测到新冠病毒，但临床分析不支持病毒通过结膜途径传播该研究纳入的病例中，有1例结膜囊新冠病毒测试呈阳性，2例为可疑阳性，这三名患者均无眼部症状。
New crown virus was detected in the conjunctival sac, but clinical analysis did not support transmission of the virus through the conjunctival route. In one case tested positive for the conjunctiva virus and in two cases suspected positive, none of the patients had eye symptoms.
一名麻醉师以结膜炎为首发症状，但结膜囊新冠病毒测试阴性。
One anesthesiologist started with conjunctivitis but tested negative for the conjunctival new crown virus.
在已有的关于结膜囊和冠状病毒的研究中，研究人员从一名7个月大的结膜炎和支气管炎患儿样本中分离出冠状病毒。
In existing studies on conjunctival sac and coronavirus, the researchers isolated coronavirus from a 7-month-old child with conjunctivitis and bronchitis.
此外，尽管在结膜囊中冠状病毒的检出率较低，但此前研究人员在SARS（严重急性呼吸综合征）患者的眼泪中检出了SARS冠状病毒。
In addition, despite the low detection rate of coronavirus in the conjunctival sac, the researchers had previously detected the SARS coronavirus in the tears of patients with SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome).
研究结果表明，新冠肺炎患者结膜炎的发生率不高。
The results showed that the incidence of conjunctivitis was not high.
目前，这种结膜炎还没有特异性表现，可以出现在一只眼睛或两只眼睛中。
At present, this conjunctivitis has no specific expression, can appear in one eye or two eyes.
早期表现为常见的结膜充血，分泌物较少。
Early manifestation is common conjunctival conjunctival congestion, secretion is less.
分泌物一般是水状的，类似于稀粘液。
The secretions are usually watery and similar to dilute mucus.
偶尔会出现少量结膜出血，患者的眼部症状较轻，基本可以自愈。
Occasionally will appear a small amount of conjunctival hemorrhage, patient's eye symptom is lighter, basically can heal from oneself.
患者之间的症状差异很大。
Symptoms vary widely among patients.
这是一个对小样本量的回顾性研究，其中只涉及到一个时间点。
This is a retrospective study of small sample sizes involving only one point in time.
此外，结膜囊拭子的阴性结果可能受采样量和时间的影响，因为病毒性结膜炎可以自愈。
In addition, the negative results of the conjunctival sac swab may be influenced by the amount and time of sampling, as viral conjunctivitis can self-heal.
病毒RNA测试中存在一定的假阴性率，因此，研究团队认为需要继续密切关注患者的进展。
There is a false-negative rate in viral RNA testing, so the team believes it is important to keep a close eye on the patient's progress.
此外，团队认为应该确定处于恢复期的患者中是否还存在新冠病毒以及结膜的感染性。
In addition, the team said it was important to determine whether there was a new crown virus and conjunctival infection in the convalescent patients.
研究团队认为，临床观察和分析可以提醒我们，不仅是眼科医生，所有医务工作者在治疗患者时都必须努力保护自己。
The team believes that clinical observation and analysis can remind us that not only ophthalmologists, but all health workers must strive to protect themselves when treating patients.
具体来说，医生必须戴口罩，护目镜，防护服和手套。
Specifically, doctors must wear masks, goggles, protective clothing and gloves.
与患者接触后，必须密切注意手部消毒以及相关检查仪器和临床环境的消毒。
After contact with the patient, close attention must be paid to hand disinfection and the disinfection of relevant instruments and clinical settings.
上述措施可以切断传播渠道，防止交叉感染，有利于支持公共卫生和安全。
Such measures can cut off transmission channels, prevent cross-infection, and support public health and safety.
总结来看，研究团队表示，可以在新冠肺炎患者的结膜囊中检测到新冠病毒。
In summary, the team said the new crown virus could be detected in the conjunctival sac of patients with Newly Coronary Pneumonia.
但通过临床分析，不支持病毒通过结膜途径传播。
However, through clinical analysis, the transmission of virus through conjunctival pathway is not supported.
新冠病毒感染性疾病的预防和治疗，显然需要更多关注和行动，应考虑并进一步检查眼部感染的可能性和眼部途径作为潜在感染源的可能性，并进行科学保护。
The prevention and treatment of new crown-virus infections clearly require more attention and action, and the possibility of eye infections and the pathway of the eye as a potential source of infection should be considered and further examined and scientifically protected.
