German Chancellor Angela Merkel made a serious prediction in parliament that more than 60 percent of Germans could end up with pneumonia, the German daily Bild was quoted as saying on Tuesday.
多家德国媒体表示，在默克尔宣布这一消息后，议会陷入了沉默。
German media said the parliament was silent after Ms. Merkel announced the news.
默克尔随后表示，根据疫情发展的严重程度，将可能有更多的活动和大型集会被取消。
Ms. Merkel later said more events and large gatherings could be canceled, depending on the severity of the outbreak.
据《图片报》报道，默克尔在议会上没有呼吁迅速采取应对疫情的严厉措施，也没有对该数据给予更详细的说明，只是列出了在疫情暴发期间该国所面临的各种可能性。
Merkel did not call in parliament for a swift and drastic response to the outbreak, nor did she give a more detailed account of the data, but merely a list of the possibilities facing the country during the outbreak, the newspaper Bild reported.

德国卫生部长拒绝关闭意大利边境据路透社11日报道，德国卫生部长施潘当天表示，封闭德国边境以防止新冠病毒的传播是行不通的，他拒绝响应邻国奥地利拒绝意大利游客入境的呼吁。
BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's health minister refused to respond to calls from neighboring Austria to deny entry to Italian tourists after sealing off the German border to prevent the spread of the virus, the German Health Minister said Tuesday.
据央视新闻3月10日消息，为防止新冠肺炎入侵，奥地利政府当地时间10日宣布，即日起对从意大利入境奥地利的人士实施入境禁令。
A ban on the entry of people from Italy into Austria has been imposed, the government announced yesterday, in an attempt to prevent a new outbreak of the disease.
施潘在接受德国电台采访时称，德国目前应对疫情的重点是减缓病毒的传播速度，以最大限度地减少该国卫生系统的负担。
In an interview with German radio, Schpan said Germany's current focus on the epidemic is to slow the spread of the virus to minimize the burden on the country's health system.
“（新冠）病毒现在就在德国，在欧洲”，他说，“即使你关闭所有边界，它仍会传播。
"The virus is now in Germany, in Europe," he said. "Even if you close all the borders, it will spread.
迟早你必须让人们自由进出，然后它就又会开始蔓延。
Sooner or later you have to let people in and out, and then it starts to spread again.
”施潘宣称，专家估计，在德国这样的先进医疗体系中，新冠肺炎的死亡率将在0.1%到0.7%之间。
Prof Schpan claims that experts estimate the death rate from pneumonia in an advanced health-care system such as Germany will be between 0.1 and 0.7 per cent.
尽管德国是欧洲人均重症监护床位最多的国家，但如果病毒传播速度过快，德国的医疗体系可能很快就会不堪重负。
Although Germany has the largest per capita number of intensive-care beds in Europe, if the virus spreads too fast, Germany's health-care system could soon become overburdened.
施潘称，为了出现避免这种情况，像足球比赛这样的大型赛事必须取消。
To avoid that, big events like football must be canceled, Mr. Spang said.
每个人都应该注意到在他们的行为方式中是否会传播这种病毒。
Everyone should be aware of whether the virus is transmitted in their behaviour.
德国：4万人口的县有300多例新冠肺炎病例德国9日报告两例新冠病毒感染死亡病例，这是德国本土自疫情暴发以来首次报告死亡病例。
Germany: Over 300 new crown pneumonia cases reported in Germany 9 days after the outbreak of the virus, the first reported death in mainland Germany since the outbreak.
这两例死亡均发生在德国疫情最为严重的北威州，其中一例来自北威州疫情集中暴发地海因斯贝格县。
Both deaths occurred in North Wales, the worst affected state in Germany, including one in Heinsberg County, where the outbreak was concentrated.
海因斯贝格县9日晚召开记者会介绍说，死亡患者是一名78岁男性，曾在近期参加过该地区的狂欢节活动，患有糖尿病等慢性病，于本月6日住院，住院时有咳嗽、腹泻和发烧症状，死于心脏衰竭。
The 78-year-old man, who recently attended a carnival in the region and suffered from chronic diseases such as diabetes, was hospitalized on June 6, and died of heart failure after coughing, diarrhea and fever in hospital, a news conference said Tuesday.
截至9日晚，这个约4万人口的县已发现了323例确诊病例，约占德国全部确诊病例的30%。
As of the evening of the 9th, 323 confirmed cases had been found in the county, with a population of about 40,000, accounting for about 30 percent of all confirmed cases in Germany.
当前有15人住院治疗，其中5人在重症监护室，而其余人居家隔离。
Fifteen people are currently hospitalized, five of them in intensive care units, while the rest are kept in isolation.
2月25日，北威州政府报告了该县首例新冠肺炎确诊患者，是一名40多岁男子，送往医院时已病情严重。
On 25 February, the Government of North Wales reported the first confirmed case of New Crown Pneumonia in the county, a 40-year-old man who had been taken to hospital in serious condition.
随后其妻子也确诊，而她是当地一名幼儿园教师。
His wife was subsequently diagnosed, and she was a local kindergarten teacher.
2月26日，海因斯贝格县关闭了所有学校和日托机构。
On 26 February, Heinsberg County closed all schools and day-care facilities.
据通报，目前该男子还在生命危险中，而其妻子病情已好转。
It was reported that the man's life was still in danger and that his wife had improved.
被确诊前，这对夫妇在不知情的情况下参加了当地狂欢节等多项社会活动，导致疫情出现密集的社区传播，且难以切断传染链。
Prior to the diagnosis, the couple unknowingly participated in a number of social activities, including the local carnival, which resulted in a high level of community transmission and made it difficult to sever the transmission chain.
但这对夫妇如何感染新冠病毒尚不可知。
But how the couple contracted the new crown virus is not known.
瑞士又被德国“欺负”了！根据瑞士《每日导报》3月11日的报道，德国汉堡海关至少扣押了一个瑞士进口商从中国订购的货运集装箱，集装箱中装有在亚洲生产的手术手套。
Hamburg, Germany, seized at least one freight container ordered from China by a Swiss importer and containing surgical gloves manufactured in Asia, the Daily Telegraph reported.
据报道，此次运输的目的地是瑞士，在德国中转。
The destination of the shipment was reportedly Switzerland, in transit in Germany.
一位消息人士称，该集装箱在汉堡的免税仓库被扣，这意味着该集装箱甚至没有在德国入关，但仍被德国当局没收。
According to one source, the container had been seized at the duty-free warehouse in Hamburg, which meant that it had not even entered Germany but was still confiscated by the German authorities.
瑞士《每日导报》评论称，正是因为这个原因，此次事件比上周德国拦截装有医用口罩的瑞士卡车的情况要严重得多。
That's why the incident was much more serious than last week's German interception of a Swiss truck with a medical mask, the Daily Guide commented.
当地时间10月晚，德国海关的一位消息人士称，该集装箱现已被放行，并称扣押只是一个疏忽。
Late in October local time, a German customs source said the container had now been released and said the seizure was an oversight.
据《新苏黎世报》此前报道，本月8日德国海关拦截了瑞士从中国进口的一批防护口罩，德国海关自上周以来一直禁止一辆装有约24万个卫生口罩和其他材料的卡车从德国离开前往瑞士。
According to the New Zurich newspaper, on the 8th of this month German customs stopped a shipment of Swiss face masks imported from China, and German customs authorities have banned a truck containing about 240,000 health masks and other materials from Germany to Switzerland since last week.
为此，瑞士方面紧急召见了德国大使表示抗议，要求德方立即放行。
To this end, the Swiss side immediately summoned the German Ambassador to protest, demanding that Germany release immediately.
在此之前，德国联邦经济部已于3月4日下令禁止向外国出口包括护目镜、防护口罩、防护服及手套等在内的各类医用防护物资。
Earlier, on 4 March, the German Federal Department of the Economy banned the export to foreign countries of all types of medical protective equipment, including goggles, face masks, protective clothing and gloves.
这一决定对瑞士的打击尤其严重，因为瑞士几乎所有医疗防护物资都依赖进口。
This decision has hit Switzerland particularly hard, as it relies on imports for almost all medical protection.
