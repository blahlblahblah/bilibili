摄影：蔡星卓记者：赵晓娟  编辑：牙韩翔“ 目前奶粉紧缺的根源在于，从奶粉经销商到母婴店、超市的物流，再到被网格化管理的消费者手中，仍然有物流方面的卡顿。
The root of the current shortage of milk powder lies in the fact that there is still a logistics gap in the hands of consumers who are being managed through the network, from the distribution of milk powder to mother and child shops, to the logistics of supermarkets.
”2月23日，一名住在武汉市硚口区的年轻妈妈在微博上求助称，自己的宝宝3个月10天，眼看要断粮，网购速度太慢，她在线下找到的一家母婴店有售宝宝吃的Alra奶粉，但这家母婴店不营业，即便销售人员送货，可是小区目前处于严格管控之下她无法外出，只好在微博上求助。
A young mother living in the Wuhan city of Zhengkou City asked on Weibo on Feb. 23 that her baby was too slow to feed herself after three months and 10 days. A mother-and-child shop she found online had Alra milk for babies, but even though salespeople were delivering goods, she was unable to travel and turned to Weibo for help.
尹建峰也有许多类似的客人发出求助信息，最近他的角色，从母婴店贝贝屋的合伙人变成了“微商”。
Mr Yin has had many similar guests send out help messages, and his role has recently changed from that of a partner in a mother-and-child shop to a "micro-business."
他自己住在武汉金地格林东郡小区，而如今最近的母婴店在4公里之外。
He himself lives in the district of Greenstone County in Jindi, Wuhan, and now the nearest mother-and-child shop is four kilometers away.
但尹建峰发现小区邻居对母婴用品的需求旺盛，在2月9日建立了东郡母婴群。
But Mr Yin, finding a strong demand for mother-and-child items from his neighborhood, set up the East County Mother and Child Group on February 9.
这个群的群公告里写着，出售美赞臣、诺优能、惠氏、美素佳儿、飞鹤等常见的奶粉品牌，此外包含纸尿裤、婴儿辅食、洗护用品等品项，供群内人员选择购买，2月24日，界面新闻获得该群的一条接龙显示，奶粉和纸尿裤是高频购买产品。
The group's bulletin said it sold popular brands of powdered milk, such as Michaelis, Noble, Wyeth, Mesujia and Crane, as well as diapers, baby accessories and toiletries for the group to choose from. On February 24, Interface News obtained a link to the group that showed that powdered milk and diapers were high-frequency purchases.
尹建峰的群公告和群内购买接龙诸如微博上求助者想要买的Alra奶粉，事实上多以进口为主，当下并不好买到。
Mr Yin's group announcements and group purchases of Alra milk powder, such as those sought by micro-bloggers, are in fact mostly imported and not readily available.
而在尹建峰的客户中，如果一名没有买到诺优能4段的妈妈，可以给孩子替换其他同一段数奶粉，但1段奶粉并不被建议轻易替换，因为6个月内的小婴儿肠胃非常脆弱，可能会存在转奶（更换奶粉）导致的肠胃问题，所以家长们往往不愿意给正在吃1、2段的婴儿转奶。
In Yin's customers, if a mother who has not bought Noyao 4 can replace the same amount of milk powder, but 1 milk powder is not recommended for easy replacement, as infants within 6 months have very weak bowels and may have stomach problems caused by milk transfer (milk powder replacement), so parents are often reluctant to milk infants who are eating 1 or 2 portions.
他们的需求每天以接龙的形式发到群里，尹建峰想办法统筹，店里缺货的会协调贝贝屋其他6个店调配，准备齐全的话当日晚上或次日早上开车至小区内，将货品分发。
Their needs are sent to the group daily in the form of a dragon, Yin Jianfeng to find a way to co-ordinate the store shortage will coordinate the other six Pui Pui House, ready to drive to the small area the same evening or the next morning to distribute the goods.
尹建峰个人因住在格林东郡，拥有小区出入证，才可以快速配送给小区内部这些零星购买的消费者。
Yin Jianfeng, who lives in Greenstone County, has a small-area pass that can be quickly distributed to these sporadic consumers in the district.
但尹建峰的店里，部分货品已经快进不到货了。
However, Yin Jianfeng's store, some of the goods have almost not entered the goods.
“要么是经销商没货了，有一部分是经销商不能送货，”他告诉界面新闻，正常情况下，母婴店把货报给经销商，他们通过第三方物流发过来或者自己送过来。
"Either the dealer is out of stock and part of the dealer can't deliver," he told Interface News, which normally reports the goods to the dealer, who sends them through third-party logistics or delivers them themselves.
但是在2月上旬到中旬这段时间，尹建峰进货更为困难，经销商因没有绿色通行证或者人手不够无法送货，都是尹建峰的同事开越野车去经销商位于汉口的仓储中心去拖货。
But between early February and mid-February, Mr. Yin had more trouble getting in, and because he didn't have a green pass or was understaffed to deliver goods, Yin's colleagues drove SUVs to the dealership's warehouse in Hankou to tow the goods.
奶粉产品一直到2月22日才被划入民生保障供应用品之列。
Milk powder products were not included in the list of guaranteed supplies until 22 February.
2月22日，湖北省召开新冠肺炎疫情防控新闻发布会，针对婴幼儿奶粉的供应问题，湖北省商务厅厅长秦军称，湖北省目前婴幼儿奶粉的保有量是1600吨，可以满足全省婴幼儿饮用一个月以上。
In response to questions about the supply of baby milk powder, Qin Jun, the commerce minister of Hubei Province, said that 1,600 tons of infant milk powder was available in Hubei province, enough for infants and young children to drink for more than one month.
他介绍，湖北省婴幼儿奶粉的销售方式主要有两种，其中70%的销售是通过专营店销售的，另有30%通过超市来销售。
He said there were two main ways of selling infant formula in Hubei province, 70 percent of which were sold through specialty stores and 30 percent through supermarkets.
秦军称，前一段时间因为防疫的需求，各家专营店都没有营业，所以导致结构性短缺。
Qinjun said that some time ago, due to the need for epidemic prevention, the specialized shops are not open, resulting in structural shortages.
发现问题以后，湖北省商务厅及时与湖北的7家大的经销商进行了沟通，将原来以专营店销售方式转变为以超市为主的销售方式，并且加上了线上销售的力度。
After the discovery of the problem, Hubei Commerce Department and Hubei seven large dealers in a timely manner to communicate, the original way of selling specialized stores into a supermarket-based sales mode, and added the strength of online sales.
目前，婴幼儿奶粉不好买的问题基本得到缓解，实现了市场供应不断供。
At present, infant milk powder is difficult to buy the problem has been basically alleviated, the market supply has been continuously supplied.
蒙牛、达能、飞鹤、菲仕兰、贝因美等奶粉企业均向界面新闻表示，目前奶粉供应已经恢复正常，其在湖北的经销商基本可以保障供应。
Mengniu, Danone, Crane, Fishland, Bayemei and other milk powder enterprises have told the interface news that the milk supply has returned to normal, its dealers in Hubei can basically guarantee the supply.
界面新闻自菲仕兰获取的一份产品民生保供企业资质证明显示，荷兰皇家菲仕兰中国业务集团在湖北从事美素佳儿婴幼儿食品经营的分公司、子公司、代理商、经销商均为湖北省民生保供重点企业，在疫情防控应急物资和民生保供物资采购、运输和省内配送中，给予优先配置和快捷通行。
According to a certificate of qualification obtained from Fischland, the subsidiary, agent and distributor of Mesujia's baby food business in Hubei Province are key enterprises of livelihood security in Hubei Province, giving priority and quick passage in the procurement, transportation and distribution of emergency supplies and supplies for prevention and control of the epidemic.
落款单位是湖北省商务厅，时间为2月19日。
The signing unit is Hubei Commercial Office, February 19.
菲仕兰供图相应的经销商可以持资质证明申请绿色通行证。
The corresponding dealer in Fisilian can apply for the Green Pass with the certificate of qualification.
湖北省婴童用品协会称，截至2月23日，首批767家婴童店店主已经进入绿色通道目录名单。
As of February 23, the first 767 baby-shop owners had entered the Green Channel Catalogue, according to the Hubei Baby Supplies Association.
但尹建峰的贝贝屋还不是该协会会员，为此不能通过该协会获得绿色通道。
However, Mr. Yin's Pui Pui House is not a member of the association and therefore cannot access the green channel through the association.
超市渠道也在努力保障供应。
Supermarket channels are also trying to secure supplies.
按湖北省商务厅的说法，超市渠道婴儿奶粉销售占比在30%。
According to the Hubei commercial department, the supermarket channel infant milk powder sales accounted for 30%.
盒马鲜生武汉的采购告诉界面新闻，个别奶粉段位供应商确实存在无货情况，他们正在想办法推动厂家、供应商尽早恢复供应。
The box horse fresh raw Wuhan procurement told the interface news, individual milk powder segment suppliers do exist stock situation, they are looking for ways to promote manufacturers, suppliers to resume supply as soon as possible.
外地供应商目前无法直送武汉，盒马采用内部调拨，例如通过上海、长沙等城市大仓调拨武汉紧缺物资。
Foreign suppliers can not send directly to Wuhan, box horses use internal redeployment, such as through Shanghai, Changsha and other cities to allocate Wuhan shortage of materials.
此外盒马还引入此前没有引入的奶粉品牌，比如飞鹤已经对接引进。
Boxed horses have also introduced brands of powdered milk not previously introduced, such as cranes that have docked for introduction.
另一方面，武汉的社区网格化管理越来越严格。
On the other hand, Wuhan community grid management is more and more strict.
以尹建峰所在的金地格林东郡小区为例，16栋楼被划分成4个网购，社区内的购物也基本以网格为单位组织统一购买，开取出入证明同样需要负责网格管理的社区人员，出入小区更为艰难。
For example, 16 buildings have been divided into 4 net purchases in Jindi Green East District, where Yin Jianfeng is located. Shopping in the community is basically organized in grid units.
目前针对武汉社区封闭式管理的现状，盒马18家门店全部都有社区团购对接。
At present, for Wuhan community closed management of the current situation, box Ma 18 stores all have community purchase docking.
为此，盒马的大部分门店已经不接待个人用户，门店工作人员全部支援线上业务，将原有组织架构全部打散，女生支援打包，男生支援配送，充足线上人力。
For this reason, most stores in the box no longer serve individual users. Shop staff support the online business, breaking up the existing organizational structure, girls supporting packaging, boys supporting distribution, and sufficient online manpower.
此外盒马在配送方面竭尽全力，例如门店有私家车的员工也在支持配送，一些门店志愿者帮助盒马捐出自家公司厢式货车，招募志愿者司机为社区送货。
Boxed horses are doing their best in terms of distribution, as do employees with private cars in stores. Some store volunteers help box horses donate their company vans and recruit volunteer drivers to deliver goods to their communities.
自2月24日开始，武汉市商务局为盒马每家门店支援公交车一辆支持社区配送。
Since Feb. 24, Wuhan City Commerce Bureau has been supporting the delivery of a bus for each store in Bohema.
但是超市渠道还不能一蹴而就。
But supermarket channels are not going to happen overnight.
尹建峰称，相比于超市渠道，顾客在母婴店购买更多，很多母婴店的销售营业员本身与顾客建有微信服务群，用来咨询、解决售后问题和调换货品等，最近这些微信群起了作用，发快递也基本上是以往累积的顾客资源，通过微信发送需求，贝贝屋再通过快递发出。
Yin said that compared to supermarket channels, customers buy more in mother and child shops. Many sales staff of mother and child shops have their own micro-mail service groups to consult customers, solve after-sales problems and exchange goods.
尴尬之处就在于，随着网格化管理趋于严格，最后一公里的端与端配送仍然不能通畅。
Embarrassment is that, as grid management tends to tighten, the last kilometer of end-to-end distribution is still not smooth.
到2月25日，上述在微博求助的妈妈仍然没有买到奶粉，好在，她收到了蒙牛雅士利捐赠的奶粉产品，至少断粮是不会了。
By February 25, her mother, who had sought help on Weibo, had not been able to buy milk powder. Fortunately, she had received milk powder donated by Mengniu Yasley.
不过她还没有想好要不要在特殊时期转奶。
But she had not yet decided whether to milk her in a special period of time.
