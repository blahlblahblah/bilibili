As of 2400 hours on January 30, 2020, the city of Huanggang has accumulated 573 cases of pneumonia infected with the new coronavirus, 12 deaths and 6 cures.
为更有效地收治、隔离病患，1月25日，湖北黄冈市委、市政府决定启用大别山区域医疗中心作为发热患者集中收治点，要求2天内将其改造成黄冈版“小汤山”，容纳1000张病床。

按照计划，这里本该在4个月后作为黄冈市中心医院新院区投入使用，新院区主体工程、室内外装饰装修均已完成。
According to the plan, the site was supposed to be operational four months later as the new compound of the Huanggang Central Hospital. The main building, indoor and outdoor decoration have all been completed.

到了9点多，20多个行动迅速的志愿者已经聚在了黄冈版“小汤山”——大别山区域医疗中心门口。

“装棉被的包裹特别重，女孩子很难搬动，从车上卸下来只能一路拖进楼。
"The quilt was so heavy that it was very difficult for the girl to carry it and she had to pull it all the way down the stairs.

Owing to the severity of the outbreak and the remoteness of the Dabie Mountain Regional Medical Centre, the hospital was unable to find sufficient workers in the short term and had to rely on volunteers in part.
一位医院工作人员向新京报记者感慨，“我们按1天600元的价格雇人，有很多人不愿意来，但志愿者们在医院从早干到晚，什么都不要。
"We hire people for 600 yuan a day and a lot of people don't want to come, but volunteers work from morning till night in the hospital," a hospital worker told the Beijing News
