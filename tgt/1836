记者：吴凡 本文来源：财联社“ 新冠肺炎疫情影响下，医疗废物数量激增，根据生态环境部公布的情况，2月11日，涉疫情医废占全国医废收集量的18.4%；湖北省涉疫情医废占全省医废收集量的67%；武汉市共收集医废47吨，全部按涉疫情医废处置。
According to the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, on February 11, the epidemic medical waste accounted for 18.4 percent of the total collection of medical waste in the whole province. In Wuhan, a total of 47 tons of medical waste were collected, all of which were treated according to the epidemic situation, according to the Ministry of Ecological Environment.
”新冠肺炎疫情影响下，医疗废物（下称“医废”）数量激增，根据生态环境部公布的情况，2月11日，涉疫情医废占全国医废收集量的18.4%；湖北省涉疫情医废占全省医废收集量的67%；武汉市共收集医废47吨，全部按涉疫情医废处置。
According to the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, on February 11, the epidemic waste accounted for 18.4 percent of the country's medical and waste collection; 67 percent of the entire province's medical and waste collection was from Hubei Province.
在此背景下，如何推动这些医废得到安全的处置，是此次防疫的关键之一。
In this context, how to promote the safe disposal of these wastes is one of the key epidemic prevention.
《科创板日报》记者了解到，包括启迪环境、东江环保等部分环卫行业内的上市公司于疫情期间强化了医废处置业务。
Scientific-board daily reporters learned that some of the environmental enlightenment, Dongjiang environmental protection and other listed companies in the sanitation industry during the epidemic intensified waste disposal business.
短期内医废处置需求的上升，或将提升环卫行业内危废（尤其是医废）企业的利润，而从长期来看，有券商认为，此次疫情过后，地方政府将加大对环卫的重视力度和投入。
Rising demand for waste disposal in the short term may boost profits for companies in the sanitation sector, especially waste, and, in the long run, brokers believe that local governments will pay more attention and investment to sanitation after the epidemic.
医废处置企业的稀缺性根据华西证券发布的研报，医废运营处置市场自 2003 年起快速发展，截至 2018 年年底，全国已有 383 家独立运行专门处置医废的公司，另外还有 24 家兼具医废和危废处置能力的公司，医废市场规模达近80亿。
According to a study published by Huaxi Securities, the medical and waste operation and disposal market has developed rapidly since 2003.By the end of 2018, there were 383 companies operating independently to deal with medical waste, and 24 companies with both medical and waste treatment capabilities, with a medical and waste market of nearly 8 billion.
值得一提的是，医废处置行业通常一个地级市仅有一张牌照，因此医废处置企业往往在当地区域具有唯一性，正是由于前述唯一性的特点，各地市的行业竞争格局较为稳定。
It is worth mentioning that the waste disposal industry usually has only one license plate in a local city, so the waste disposal enterprises often have uniqueness in the local area.
《科创板日报》 记者了解到，在A股市场中，有部分公司早已布局医废处置业务，医废运营规模较大的公司包括中节能集团、润邦股份、汇洋环保、启迪环境、东江环保、瀚洋集团和河南利盈环保。
In the A-share market, some companies have already laid out their medical and waste disposal business. Some of the companies that operate on a larger scale include the China Energy Conservation Group, Runbang Shares, Huiyang Environmental Protection, Enlightening the Environment, Dongjiang Environmental Protection, Hanyang Group and Henan Liying Environmental Protection.
比如，启迪环境目前在湖北宜昌、安徽亳州、安徽淮南等地都有在运营的医废处理项目，单个项目的日处理量约为3-8吨，在本次疫情期间，公司也加大重点调整配备环保防护专项设备、环卫作业物料、消毒剂等物料到疫情重灾区。
For example, the Enlightenment environment is currently operating in Yichang, Bozhou, Anhui Province and Huainan, Anhui Province. The daily capacity of individual projects is about 3-8 tons.
东江环保在广东、江苏、浙江、福建、河北、湖北等省份的生产基地已开始全力处理医废，目前公司具备44类危险废物经营资质，危废处理处置能力超过180万吨/年。
Dongjiang environmental protection bases in Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Hebei and Hubei provinces have begun to deal with medical waste. At present, the company has 44 types of hazardous waste management qualification, with a hazardous waste treatment and disposal capacity of more than 1.8 million tons / year.
另外，疫情期间，中金环境旗下子公司浙江金泰莱环保科技有限公司被列为肺炎疫情医废应急处置企业。
In addition, during the outbreak, Zhongjin Environment subsidiary Zhejiang Jintai Lai Environmental Technology Co. Ltd. was listed as the pneumonia emergency treatment enterprises.
不难看出的是，受疫情影响，短期内医废处置需求明显提升，那么前述情况是否会对上述危废处理企业的业绩带来显著的提升？中原证券发布报告认为，医废供给增加有利于提升医废处理厂运行负荷，降低单位处理成本。
It is not difficult to see that the impact of the epidemic, the short-term demand for waste disposal will significantly improve the performance of the above-mentioned enterprises? Zhongyuan Securities issued a report that the increase in the supply of waste medical treatment plants to increase the operating load, reduce unit processing costs.
但医废处理量占危险废物总处理量的比重较小，因此，对危废处理公司的2020年业绩影响较为有限。
However, the proportion of waste treatment volume in the total amount of hazardous waste is small, so the impact on the performance of waste treatment companies in 2020 is limited.
不过，若从盈利性的角度来看，医废业务确实能为企业带来可观的利润。
However, from a profit-making point of view, the waste business can indeed bring considerable profits.
比如去年11月，润邦股份公布拟9.9亿元收购中油优艺73.36%股权的交易报告书显示， 中油优艺医废处置业务板块，2018 年医废产能为 2.49 万吨，医废处置收入 8107 万元，毛利率为 45%；2017 年医废产能 2.1 万吨，医废处置收入 6864 万元，毛利率为 40%，前述两年医废处置业务毛利率的平均值为42.62%。
For example, in November last year, Run State announced a proposed $990 million purchase of 73.36% of CNOOC's waste disposal business, with a capacity of 24,900 tons in 2018, 81.07 million yuan in waste disposal revenue, with a gross interest rate of 45%.
行业将愈加重视有观点认为，疫情之下，政府对医疗垃圾及医疗污水的监管力度都将逐步加大，除了医废、危废处理行业有望迎来快速增长外，环卫行业需求也将被拉动。
The industry will pay more attention to the view that under the epidemic, the government will gradually increase the supervision of medical waste and sewage treatment, in addition to medical waste, waste disposal industry is expected to usher in rapid growth, sanitation industry demand will be pulled.
有环境卫生行业内人士向《科创板日报》 记者介绍，目前环卫行业主要突出三大板块：环卫装备、终端处理以及环卫服务。
The sanitation industry is focusing on three major sectors: sanitation equipment, terminal treatment and sanitation services, a spokesman for the industry told the Daily Science Founder.
《科创板日报》记者了解到，A股环卫装备行业以龙马环卫、盈峰环境为代表，其中盈峰环境于2018年通过斥资152.5亿元收购中联环境100%股权，布局了环卫装备领域。
"Science Board Daily" reporters learned that the A-share sanitation equipment industry to Longma sanitation, Yingfeng environment as the representative, among them Pingfeng environment through the purchase of 152.5 billion yuan in 2018, 100% of the environment, layout sanitation equipment.
安信环保团队认为，从需求端看，环卫装备市场空间的驱动主要来自三个方面：环卫机械化带来的增量市场、存量设备升级改造的存量市场以及垃圾分类带来的增量，其中，随着垃圾分类工作持续推进，有望为环卫设备带来超200亿市场空间。
On the demand side, the EMG believes that the market space for sanitation equipment is driven by three main sources: the incremental market created by sanitation mechanization, the stock market for upgrading inventory of equipment, and the increment from waste segregation, which is expected to generate more than $20 billion in market space for sanitation equipment as waste separation continues.
就此次疫情防控而言，带来的直接影响是消毒车需求量增大，环卫装备生产商或受益。
In the case of the epidemic, the immediate impact is increased demand for disinfectors, which may benefit manufacturers of sanitation equipment.
与之相比，终端处理市场主要指的是，前端所有环节结束到终端处理厂之后的环节，例如垃圾焚烧等，上文提及的医废处置、危废处置即属于该领域，这一市场的A股代表公司为启迪环境、高能环保等。
In contrast, the end-of-pipe processing market refers primarily to the end-to-end process, such as waste incineration, which is covered by the waste disposal and waste disposal mentioned above. The A-share of this market represents the company's environmental enlightenment, high energy environmental protection, etc.
上述业内人士表示，环卫装备，每年约300亿至500亿的市场规模；终端处理市场规模跟环卫装备的市场规模相似；环卫服务的市场则最大，预估市场化规模在2000亿左右。
According to these industry insiders, sanitation equipment has a market size of about $30 billion to $50 billion a year; the end-of-pipe market is similar in size to that of sanitation equipment; and the market for sanitation services is the largest, with an estimated market size of about $200bn.
值得注意的是，虽然市场空间大，但是国内环卫服务市场集中度较低。
It is worth noting that, despite the large market space, domestic markets for sanitation services are less concentrated.
比如近期A股上市的环卫公司玉禾田，其主营业务为物业清洁和市政环卫等环境卫生综合管理服务深耕环卫行业超过20年，但即便如此，公司自身测算的2018年的市场占有率只有约4%，这也意味着提升空间广阔。
For example, the recent A-share listing of Jade Hetian, a sanitation company whose main business is the deep-ploughed sanitation sector for integrated sanitation management services such as property cleaning and municipal sanitation for more than 20 years, the company's own estimate of 2018 market share is only about 4 per cent, which means there is plenty of room for improvement.
市场前景广阔，玉禾田更是在2月12和2月13日两天里，迎来了超过90家机构进行线上电话会议调研。
The market is bright, jade grain field is in February 12 and February 13 two days, welcomed more than 90 organizations to conduct online teleconference research.
谈及此次疫情的影响，玉禾田称，其环卫市场化项目最近 2-3 月暂时有所停滞，但只是短期影响，疫情过去会释放短期；长期来看，疫情过后国家对卫生防疫、环境服务的标准会大幅度提高，长期会有正向影响。
Turning to the impact of the epidemic, Yu said that its sanitation market-oriented projects had temporarily stalled in February-March, but only in the short term, and that the epidemic would release short-term funds.
预计疫情将倒逼各级政府更加重视公共环境卫生的管理，环卫市场将迎来更大的爆发。
It is expected that the epidemic will push governments at all levels to place greater emphasis on public sanitation management and a greater explosion in sanitation markets.
