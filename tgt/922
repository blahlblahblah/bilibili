At the time of the siege, police and other personnel stationed at Changjiang Bridge were at 003.
真是脸叔。
That's uncle face.
苍衣社                      。
Coverture Society.
苍衣社。
Coverture Society.
你从未见识的城市江湖。
A city you've never seen before.
【疫情之下】是苍衣社开设的非虚构故事专栏，记录在新型冠状病毒疫情蔓延时，普通中国人的抗疫报告。
Amid the epidemic is a non-fiction column by the Cangxie Society that documents the common Chinese's response to the epidemic as the new coronavirus epidemic spreads.
大家好，我是脸叔。
Hi, everyone. I'm uncle face.
在这个特殊时期，我社开设【疫情之下】专栏，记录普通人的抗疫故事。
At this particular time, the Society opened a column on "Under the Epidemic," which records the stories of ordinary people fighting epidemics.
在这一场灾难中，没有人能够置身事外。
In this disaster, no one is immune.
希望疫情的亲历者、见证者，都能讲述自己的故事。
Hope that the experience of the epidemic, witnesses, can tell their own story.
今天的讲述者是一个警察，在封城令下时，他被派往九江长江一桥守桥，劝返过来的湖北人。
Today's narrator is a policeman. When ordered to do so, he was sent to the bridge over the Yangtze River in Jiujiang and persuaded Hubei people to come back.
但是没有人知道，他的家乡在湖北省黄冈市黄梅县，他也是一个湖北人。
But no one knows, his hometown in Huanggang Huangmei County, Hubei Province, he is also a Hubei people.
他无数次梦见自己回到家乡，和湖北人站在一起。
He dreamt many times that he was back home with the Hubei people.
这是疫情之下的第3篇抗疫报告【长江大桥守桥人】地点：江西省九江市时间：2020年1月-2月全文 3870字，阅读约需 5分钟1月23日凌晨，吴洁隐约听见客厅传来翻找物品的窸窣声，她摸了摸身旁，被窝尚有余温。
This is the third report of the epidemic [Changjiang Bridge] Shijiangqiao, Jiangxi Province, Jiujiang City 2000January 23, 2020 The full text takes about 5 minutes. In the early morning hours of January 23, Wu Jie faintly heard the rumbling of rummage in the living room.
丈夫郭子栋从警二十一年，深夜赶去单位加班是常有的事。
Her husband Guo Zitong from the police 21 years, late at night rushed to work overtime is common.
吴洁也不觉得奇怪，打着哈欠问：“有任务？”“武汉那边有情况，局里要求集合。
Wu Jie was not surprised, and yawned: "Have a mission?" "Wuhan side of the situation, the Bureau asked for a collection.
”郭子栋没跟她详细解释集合的原因，在工具箱里找到一个棉质口罩，从浴室取走一顶浴帽，进另一间卧室拿了儿子的泳镜，“说要我们带点防护装备。
"Without explaining why, he found a cotton mask in the kit, removed a bathrobe from the bathroom and went into the other bedroom to get his son's goggles.
”困意未尽的吴洁以为郭子栋要去武汉出差，她习惯性地打开手机搜索从家到目的地的距离和时间，在这段时间内她不会打电话影响丈夫开车。
The sleepy Ms. Wu, who thinks Guo is on a business trip to Wuhan, habitually turns on her mobile phone to find the distance and time between home and destination, during which time she won't call her husband to influence his car.
地图显示，两地之间相距243公里。
The map shows 243 kilometres between the two places.
吴洁是土生土长的江西九江人。
Wu Jie is a native of Jiangxi Jiujiang people.
九江是江西省北大门，紧依长江，与湖北省隔江相望，开车过去只需十几分钟。
Jiujiang is the northern gate of Jiangxi Province. It is next to the Changjiang River.
历史上九江因两件事著名，一是《水浒传》里宋江题在浔阳楼上的反诗，二是1998年的洪灾大决堤。
Jiujiang is famous for two things in history, the first is the Song Jiang in the "Outlaws of the Margin" in Xunyang upstairs, the other is the 1998 flood breakwater.
在那场洪灾中，吴洁的家园被毁，因缘巧合认识了现在的丈夫郭子栋。
In that flood, Wu Jie's home was destroyed by chance to know her husband Guo Zitong.
洪水决堤后，吴洁和家人被部队救起，临时安置在长江对岸湖北省黄冈市黄梅县的一间厂房内。
After the flood burst, Wu Jie and her family were rescued by troops and temporarily housed in a factory building in Huangmei County, Huanggang City, Hubei Province, across the Yangtze River.
郭子栋是当时照顾灾民的志愿者之一。
Guo Zitong was one of the volunteers who cared for the victims.
洪灾过后，郭子栋与吴洁确定了恋爱关系，并通过考试进入九江市公安系统，两人在九江安了家。
After the flood, Guo Zitong and Wu Jie confirmed the relationship, and through the examination into the Jiujiang City public security system, two people in Jiujiang home.
黄梅县被称为“江北”，九江人基本没把那儿当外地。
Huangmei County is known as "Jiangbei," Jiujiang people did not basically there when the field.
两地关系密切，许多黄梅人也在九江购房、读书、求医、工作。
There are close relations between the two places, many Huangmei people in Jiujiang to buy houses, read, seek medical care, work.
郭子栋时常抱怨九江许多小偷偷到电动车后，直接骑到江北出售，监控追到江边便追不下去，需要联系湖北省警方，办案程序复杂。
Guo Zitong often complains that many thieves of Jiujiang have stolen to electric cars and sold them directly to Jiangbei.
吴洁对湖北的印象仅限于此，以至于郭子栋忽然提起武汉，她并不知道这个邻省省会离九江有多远。
Wu Jie's impression of Hubei was so limited that Guo suddenly mentioned Wuhan, and she had no idea how far the provincial capital was from Jiujiang.
几分钟后，已经出门的郭子栋再次返回家中，打开专门放警用装备的那一格衣橱，穿上雨衣和反光背心，犹豫片刻将一根伸缩警棍放入裤子口袋，迟疑了下，又将一副手铐放入另一侧口袋。
A few minutes later, Mr. Guo returned home again, opened the special police kit closet, put on a raincoat and reflective vest, hesitated briefly to place a telescopic baton in his trousers pocket, hesitated, and put a pair of handcuffs in the other pocket.
再出门时，吴洁忽然想起最近几天武汉的肺炎新闻，提醒郭子栋多加小心。
As she went out again, Wu Jie suddenly remembered the news of pneumonia in Wuhan in recent days, reminding Guo Zitong to be more careful.
“不去武汉，我去守桥。
"I will not go to Wuhan, I will keep the bridge.
”郭子栋回头安慰她，眼眶有些发红。
"Guo Zidong turned back to comfort her, his eyes red.
郭子栋返回家里取东西，是因为第一次出门后工作群发了两条消息：对一桥、二桥实施管控，全体民警按排班表上岗；对所有湖北牌照车辆进行身份核实、体温测量和去向登记，不得疏漏。
Guo Zitong returned home to pick up things, because after the first time to work group issued two messages: control of a bridge, Erqiao, all civilian police in accordance with the shift schedule; all Hubei license plates for the vehicle identification, temperature measurement and whereabouts of the registration, should not miss.
从湖北进入江西除了铁路和轮渡外，最重要的就是长江大桥。
In addition to the railway and ferry from Hubei into Jiangxi, the most important is the Yangtze River Bridge.
其中九江长江一桥、二桥（高速公路）已投入使用多年，车流量极大。
Jiujiang Yangtze River one bridge, two bridges (expressway) has been in use for many years, great traffic.
从湖北出来，想要东行的车辆，基本都要经过九江。
From Hubei, want to travel eastbound vehicles, basic have to go through Jiujiang.
郭子栋被安排值守九江长江一桥，这里不仅能通机动车和非机动车，还能通行人。
Guo Zitong was assigned to a bridge over the Yangtze River in Jiujiang, where people can travel not only by motor and non-motorized vehicles.
武汉肺炎发生之初，郭子栋就有不好的预感，可是没有确切的消息源，只能暗自祈祷自己预感有误。
Wuhan pneumonia at the beginning, Guo Zitong has a bad presentiment, but there is no accurate source of information, can only secretly pray their own premonition error.
现在武汉刚宣布封城，作为省界的九江立刻给予管控回应，这让郭子栋心里一紧。
Now Wuhan has just announced the closure of the city, as the provincial boundaries of Jiujiang immediately gave a regulatory response, which let Guo Zitong heart tight.
抵达一桥时，那里已经堵成一团，各地牌照的车辆无序排列在收费站前的空地上，等待测温和登记。
By the time they reached the bridge, it was already jammed, with vehicles with plates all over the lot in front of the toll booth, waiting for temperature measurement and registration.
作者图|桥上收费站负责人分派下工作内容——岗位实行三班倒，每个班八小时，撤下去的在旁边查报站休息，到点上岗。
The person in charge of the toll station at the bridge has been assigned the job - three shifts of eight hours each, with the next station rest and on duty.
没有发烧的让过，发烧的把车扣下来，人交给医疗组那边处理。
Do not have a fever to let go, a fever to take the car down, to the medical team to deal with.
不算很严格，郭子栋稍稍松了口气。
Not very strict, Guo Zitong a little relieved.
天亮时，车量大增，车群里不时发出争吵声。
As daylight dawned, the volume of traffic increased and the crowd began to squabble.
有九江本地车主嫌弃工作人员效率低下的，有湖北车主责怪工作人员歧视他们的，民警与不配合检查的车主时有冲突。
Some local drivers in Jiujiang are disloyal to inefficient staff, some in Hubei blame the staff for discriminating against them, and the police clash with owners who do not cooperate with the inspection.
带队领导临时决定取消原先的三班倒工作制，错峰休整，每个人的休息时间缩减为四个小时。
The team leader temporarily decided to abolish the previous three-shift work system, staggered break, each person's rest time reduced to four hours.
上午10点，武汉正式封城，同时九江出现第一例疑似病例。
At 10 a.m., Wuhan officially closed the city, while Jiujiang appeared the first suspected case.
一桥管控力度升级，挂有湖北牌照的车辆不允许通行。
One of the bridge control efforts to upgrade, Hubei license plates are not allowed to pass.
郭子栋和同事顺着车队向后排查，将消息告知队伍中“鄂”字车牌的车主，并引导他们调头。
Guo Zitong and his colleagues followed the convoy back to find out who owned the "E" plates in the queue and led them to turn around.
车辆逐渐减少的同时，郭子栋发现步行的人逐渐增多。
As the number of cars dwindled, Guo found a steady increase in pedestrians.
与一桥湖北端工作人员联系后他才得知，许多调头车辆在湖北端下桥后就近停车，车上的人选择步行过江。
After contacting the staff of Hubei end of a bridge, he learned that many U-turn vehicles in Hubei end of the bridge after the nearest parking, the people chose to cross the river on foot.
郭子栋他们的排查工作从拦车变为拦人。
Guo Zidong Their search changed from blocking cars to stopping people.
工作难度不断增加，几乎跟每个人都要费些口舌，尤其是黄梅籍人员。
The work became more difficult, and it took almost everyone, especially the Huangmei people, to talk.
经过多年同化，黄梅方言与九江方言十分相似，黄梅人对九江的城市也熟悉，谎称自己身份证遗失且不记得身份证号码，让人很难甄别。
After many years of assimilation, Huangmei dialect and Jiujiang dialect very similar, Huangmei people also familiar with the city of Jiujiang, falsely claimed that their identity cards are lost and do not remember the identity card number, it is difficult to distinguish.
郭子栋在黄梅和九江生活多年，能够轻松地从交谈中分辨出对方细微的方言发音差别，因此效率比其他同事要高出许多。
Having lived in Huangmei and Jiujiang for many years, Guo is able to tell the difference in pronunciation from each other's subtle dialects easily and is therefore much more efficient than other colleagues.
渐渐的，被盘查人员的愤怒都聚集到他身上。
Gradually, the anger of the interrogators gathered around him.
郭子栋于心不忍，向领导请示非武汉籍、未发热的其他湖北人能否放行，得到的答复是“干不了就换人”。
Guo Zitong in mind, to ask the leadership of non-Wuhan nationality, not hot other Hubei people can be released, the answer is "can not do change people."
郭子栋最终撤下了大桥，换到收费站口继续查车。
Guo Zitong finally pulled down the bridge and moved to the toll gate to continue the inspection.
他时不时抬头看一眼大桥中段那些被劝返的人群，心里说不出是什么滋味。
Every now and then he looked up at the people who had been persuaded to return to the middle of the bridge and wondered what it was like.
中午12点，上半天的强硬措施让一桥迎来了短暂的有序，也轮到了郭子栋休整。
At 12: 00 noon, the first half-day of the strong measures to usher in a temporary order of a bridge, but also Guo Zidong rest.
郭子栋胃不好，吃冷掉的饭菜容易呕吐，于是他步行到桥下一家便利店内找微波炉加热盒饭。
Guo had a bad stomach and was prone to vomiting when he ate cold food, so he walked to a convenience store under the bridge to find a microwave to heat the lunch.
从半夜接到任务到现在，他连口热水都没喝上一口。
He hasn't had a bite of hot water since he got his assignment in the middle of the night.
透过便利店的玻璃望出去，九江长江一桥横亘在长江上，冰冷钢铁似乎让江面温度更低了一些。
A bridge across the Yangtze River across the Jiujiang River looks out of the window of a convenience store. The cold steel seems to make the river cooler.
水汽升腾，将两千多米外的湖北省隐入层层迷雾之中。
Water vapor rising, more than 2,000 meters away in Hubei Province hidden layer after layer of fog.
作者图|迷雾中的大桥三个月前，郭子栋也在这里值守了数个夜晚，为武汉举办的世界军人运动会盘查入鄂车辆，那是保证湖北安全的一道屏障。
The Bridge in the Mist Three months ago, Guo Zitong was on duty here for several nights, checking E-E vehicles for the Wuhan World Military Games, a barrier to Hubei's safety.
大约过了半小时，郭子栋回到桥上。
About half an hour later, Guo Zitong returned to the bridge.
此时，收费站只剩下两个上桥口开放，下桥口通道全部关闭，现场乱作一团，高音喇叭面朝湖北方向循环播放劝返政策。
At this point, the toll station is only two open on the bridge, all the passageways are closed, the scene of confusion, loudspeakers face Hubei circular playing persuasion policy.
郭子栋心里咯噔一下，管控再次升级了。
Guo Zitong heart clicked, control has been upgraded once again.
微信工作群里发来要求：湖北省黄冈市即将在24日0时封城，各卡点做好应对准备，长江一桥九江端单向封闭，只上不下，对湖北方向过来的所有非九江籍机动车（赣G开头）车辆和非九江籍人员（身份证号码3604开头)全部劝返。
Huanggang, Hubei Province, will be closed at 0: 00 on the 24th, the card points are ready to respond, Jiujiang end of the Yangtze River one-way closure, only not up and down, Hubei all non-Jiujiang nationality vehicles (Jiangxi G start) and non-Jiujiang staff (ID card 3604 at the beginning).
乌云在两岸的半空来回盘旋，低沉沉的，压得人喘不过气来。
Dark clouds were hovering back and forth across the banks, low and heavy, breathless.
郭子栋看见几辆九江牌照的汽车似乎从眼前过去了好几次，每次车里都载满乘客。
Guo Zitong saw cars with Jiujiang license plates pass by several times, each time filling with passengers.
一辆雪佛兰再次通过时，郭子栋示意车辆靠边停车。
When a Chevrolet passed again, Guo zitong motioned for the car to pull over.
经过分开询问，有数名九江司机以每人数千元的高昂价格，将对岸滞留的湖北人带入九江。
After questioning separately, several drivers from Jiujiang brought stranded Hubei people into Jiujiang for thousands of yuan each.
仅这个雪佛兰司机便已经带过来十四人。
The Chevrolet driver alone has brought in fourteen people.
司机被派出所带走，车上的三名黄冈市黄梅县籍乘客被口头批评后劝返。
The driver was taken away from the police station and three Huangmei County passengers from Huanggang City were verbally criticized and persuaded to return.
没有车辆送他们返回湖北，他们只能靠步行，路过阻截区的时候，有人攥紧警戒带哭泣。
There were no vehicles to take them back to Hubei. They had to walk by the stop zone.
桥上风雨欲来，郭子栋好不容易找到两把伞，递给三人中年纪稍长的那位，嘱咐道“路滑，注意安全”。
When the wind and rain came on the bridge, Guo Zitong found two umbrellas and handed them to the older of the three.
不过，郭子栋没有想到，他听出别人的黄梅口音，黄梅人也能听出他口中熟悉的乡音。
However, Guo Zitong did not think, he recognized other people's Huangmei accent, Huangmei people can also recognize his familiar accent.
“来九江很多年了吧。
"Jiujiang for many years.
”年长者说。
"said the old man.
郭子栋愣了愣，把伞塞到年长者手里，“别怪我们，如果你还有亲人在湖北，或许就能理解。
Guo Zidong Leng Leng, the umbrella into the hands of the elderly, "do not blame us, if you still have relatives in Hubei, perhaps can understand.
”江面开始飘雨，单位配发的一次性口罩已经用完。
The river began to rain, and the unit issued a disposable mask has been used up.
郭子栋脸上的这个口罩已经连续戴了超过十个小时，此时被雨水浸湿糊在脸上，他觉得有些喘不过气来。
Guo Zitong has been wearing the mask for more than 10 hours before the rain soaked his face and he felt a little breathless.
城区里负责筛查湖北人的工作组不断传来信息，保守估计进入江西的湖北人已超过30万，滞留在九江的有5至10万，卡口必须确保不能再有湖北人入赣。
The working group in charge of screening Hubei people in urban areas has been sending information to us, conservatively estimating that more than 300,000 Hubei people have crossed into Jiangxi and 50,000 to 100,000 stay in Jiujiang.
郭子栋他们的工作还在继续。
Guo Zidong Their work is still going on.
1月24日，除夕。
New Year's Eve, 24 January.
早晨八点，包括郭子栋在内第一批守桥的人被撤下，安置在附近的工作站轮休一天。
At eight o'clock in the morning, the first people to keep the bridge, including Guo Zitong, were removed and put in a nearby workstation for a day's rest.
下桥前，郭子栋听见现场指挥官向新到岗的人员宣布：一桥双向全封闭。
Before descending the bridge, Guo Zidong heard the field commander announce to the newly arrived personnel: a bridge is completely closed in both directions.
郭子栋给吴洁打电话报平安，吴洁告诉他城里有居民自发组织上街寻找湖北车辆，街道和物业在挨家挨户登记在住人员信息，街道出现了对湖北不太友好的标语。
Guo Zitong called Wu Jie, who told him that residents of the city had spontaneously organized street search for Hubei vehicles, street and property in the house registration information, the streets of Hubei less friendly slogans.
郭子栋让吴洁发照片，吴洁挑了几张没那么过分的发来，完了可能还是觉得不妥，又补充了句“你别伤心”。
Guo Zitong asked Wu Jie to take photos of Wu Jie, Wu Jie selected a few not so excessive sent, after the end may still feel inappropriate, and added the phrase "do not sad."
作者图|街头标语朋友圈也出现了各种调侃湖北人的段子，郭子栋在一条内容为“与管控同时升级的，还有湖北人的不满情绪”动态下面留言，“那不是不满情绪，是求生欲”。
"That's not discontent, it's survival," says Guo Zitong, a blogger at Hubei province who posted a line about "escalating at the same time as control and discontent among Hubei people."
疲惫感、失落感、无力感同时袭来，郭子栋迷迷糊糊地睡着了。
Feeling exhausted, lost and powerless, Guo Zitong fell asleep in a daze.
屏幕还停留在妻子发来的那些照片上，许久没有暗下去。
The screen still stays on those pictures sent by the wife, and has not dimmed for a long time.
他没告诉妻子，那天之后，他每天都会做同样的梦，梦见自己回到了家乡黄梅县，和那些被伤害的湖北人站在一起。
He did not tell his wife that after that day, he would have the same dream every day and dream of returning to his hometown of Huangmei County to stand with the injured Hubei people.
九江长江一桥双向封闭后，郭子栋每天守桥的时间固定在早晨八点至下午两点。
Jiujiang Yangtze River a two-way bridge closed, Guo Zidong every day to the bridge between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m.
下桥后他不再回家，工作环境容易感染，留在工作站也是自我隔离的一种方式。
When he got off the bridge, he stopped coming home, the work environment was susceptible to infection, and remaining at his workstation was a way of isolating himself.
试图过桥的人每天都在减少，郭子栋不知道这算不算是他们对命运的一种妥协。
As the number of people trying to cross the bridge dwindled daily, Guo did not know whether it was a compromise on their fate.
与武汉、黄冈封城之前逃离的人相比，郭子栋发现这些除夕过后仍渴望过桥进入九江市区的人，更多的是在这边有牵挂：来自黄梅县小池镇的中年男人在大年初三强行冲卡，因为独居在九江的八旬母亲患有多种疾病，他定期买药送来九江，封桥后母亲可能已经断药了；大年初四，一个青年男子辱骂守桥民警，他一边骂一边吼，有孕在身的护士妻子不顾他的反对，还在九江坚持上班；在网上很火的“划澡盆渡江被九江警方拦截”事件，当事人也是为了回九江工作。
Compared with those who fled before the closure of Wuhan and Huanggang, Guo found that these people still yearn to cross the bridge into Jiujiang City after the New Year's Eve, more people are concerned about this side: the 80-year-old mother from Huangmei County, Jiujiang City.
郭子栋值班时将登记的情况都记在心里，私下与当事人联系，情况属实且急需帮助的，他答应下桥后帮忙想办法。
Guo Zitong on duty to record the registration in mind, private contact with the client, the situation is true and urgently needed help, he promised to get off the bridge to help find ways.
有人把这件事在小池镇里传开了，几乎每天轮到郭子栋值守大桥的时候，都有人来寻求帮助。
Someone spread the story around the town, and almost every day, when it was Guo's turn to guard the bridge, someone came to ask for help.
郭子栋帮人带过腊肉、蔬菜和口罩，还帮一对分隔两地的情侣交换过书信。
Guo helped bring bacon, vegetables and masks, and exchanged letters between a couple who had separated the two places.
2月1日上午，桥上来了一对黄梅县小池镇的母女。
February 1 morning, the bridge came up to a pair of small Huangmei County town mother and daughter.
女儿二十六岁，身患白血病，一直在武汉协和医院治疗，去年12月到今年1月，她刚在医院做了第一个疗程的化疗。
Her daughter, 26, with leukaemia, has been treated at Wuhan Concorde Hospital, where she underwent her first course of chemotherapy from December to January this year.
肺炎爆发后，武汉协和医院资源紧张，她无法进行第二次化疗。
After the outbreak of pneumonia, Wuhan Concorde Hospital resources were tight, she could not carry out a second chemotherapy.
作者图|小池镇的母女“求求你们，只让我女儿一个人过去就行，我不过去。
Mother and daughter at Little Pool Town. "Please, just let my daughter pass by alone. I can't.
”五十岁的母亲跪在地上磕头请求放行。
"The 50-year-old mother knelt down and kowtow and asked to be allowed.
郭子栋了解到这一特殊情况后，没有执行之前所有人员必须劝返的规定，而是将情况逐级上报。
Aware of this particular situation, Guo Zitong did not enforce the previous mandatory return of all personnel, but instead reported the situation step by step.
在核实清楚情况属实后，九江市肺炎疫情防控应急指挥部做出同意二人通行的决定。
After verifying that the situation is true, the Jiujiang City Pneumonia Emergency Command made a decision to allow two people to pass.
考虑到母女长期在疫情中心城市逗留，又通知了救护车辆和医护人员上桥来接。
In view of the long stay of mothers and daughters in the centre of the epidemic, ambulance vehicles and medical staff were notified to come to the bridge to meet them.
这天夜里，郭之栋难得睡得安稳。
That night, Guo Zhidong rarely sleep peacefully.
他梦见了家乡的梅花开了。
He dreamed that the plum blossoms were blooming in his hometown.
2月2日，春节过半，长江一桥上人迹罕至。
In the middle of the Spring Festival on February 2, few people crossed the Yangtze River.
零星有心存希望的湖北人步行试探过桥，郭子栋再次劝他们回去。
Pieces of hope Hubei people walked across the bridge, Guo Zitong again advised them to go back.
九江这边天晴，太阳缓慢向当空移动，桥上依旧风声大作。
Jiujiang this side of the fine day, the sun slowly moving into the air, the bridge is still the wind sound.
守着桥，郭子栋感觉有点冷。
Watching the bridge, Guo Zitong feels a little cold.
无事可做的时候，他便眯着眼看太阳，希望它能爬得再快一点，再高一点，把光和热送到桥的那一边去。
When there was nothing to do, he squinted at the sun, hoping that it would climb faster and higher and carry light and heat across the bridge.
