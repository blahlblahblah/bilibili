这些新增确诊病例主要从哪里来？“新华视点”记者进行了追踪。
Where did the newly diagnosed cases come from? The Xinhua Viewpoint reporter followed up.
80%-90%来自疑似病例，有些隔离点密接人群确诊比例高于5%据了解，目前武汉重点排查、管理与新冠肺炎有关的群体，主要包括疑似病例、密接人员等。
About 80 percent to 90 percent of the cases come from suspected cases, and the proportion of confirmed cases in some isolated places is higher than 5 percent.
那么，新增确诊病例主要来自哪个群体？首先，疑似病例群体是新增确诊病例的主要来源。
So, which group are the main sources of newly diagnosed cases? First, the population of suspected cases is the main source of newly diagnosed cases.
国家卫生健康委新冠肺炎疫情应对处置工作专家组组长梁万年日前介绍，目前，武汉新增确诊病例中80%到90%是由疑似病例转过来的。
Liang Wannian, head of the group of experts dealing with the new crown pneumonia epidemic, said 80 percent to 90 percent of the newly confirmed cases in Wuhan had been referred by suspected cases.
以2月28日为例，武汉新增确诊420人，按上述比例计算，其中由疑似病例转化而来的在336人至378人之间。

据武汉市新冠肺炎防控指挥部的数据，2月28日武汉有疑似病人788人，当日新增疑似病例114人。

武汉市一主城区密接隔离点管理人员分析，近期，由于核酸检测范围扩大到了密接人群，此前一些未能发现的无症状感染者也被排查发现，因此确诊病例明显增加。
Recently, due to the expansion of nucleic acid testing to close-knit populations, a number of previously unidentified asymptomatic infections have been detected, leading to a marked increase in confirmed cases, analysts said.
