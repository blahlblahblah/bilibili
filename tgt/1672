”近期，包括湖南日报、盐城电视台、上饶新闻网在哪的多地媒体报道当地环保部门使用所谓的“环保酵素”，用于洒水车喷洒及道路、公厕消毒等。
In recent days, local environmental authorities, including Hunan Daily, Yancheng TV and Shang Rao News, have reported where local environmental authorities are using so-called "green enzymes" for sprinkler spraying and road and public toilet disinfection.

河南省焦作东沁阳村也有个人使用所谓的“环保酵素”对村内进行喷洒消毒。
In Dongqinyang Village, Jiaozuo Province, Henan Province, individuals also use so-called "environmental enzymes" to spray and disinfect the village.
瑞士联邦理工博士后研究员、化学博士刘朋昕收到的各地网友信息显示，不完全统计，合肥、中山、肇庆、盐城、襄阳、西安、上饶、衡水等地部分地区都先后使用“环保酵素”进行消毒。
According to the information received by Liu Pengxin, a post-doctoral researcher of the Swiss Confederation of Science and Technology and a local netizen researcher, Liu Pengxin of the Swiss Federal Department of Science and Technology, reported that incomplete statistics show that some areas such as Hefei, Zhongshan, Zhaoqing, Yancheng, Xiangyang, Xi'an, Shang Rao and Hengshui have successively used "environmental enzymes" to disinfect.
不同于此前用于食用的主要成分为蛋白质的植物酵素，刘朋昕表示所谓的“环保酵素”本身并不算是酵素，“是果皮和糖细菌发酵后，得到的一个发酵的馊水。
Unlike plant enzymes, which were previously used to make proteins, Liu said the so-called "environmental enzymes" themselves were not enzymes, "a fermented, bad water obtained by fermentation of fruit peel and sugar bacteria.
”但是，这些生产酵素的公司可不是这样的宣传自己的。
But the companies that produce the enzymes do not advertise themselves in this way.
根据微信公众号“中山环保酵素推广中心”的发布文章显示：环保酵素稀释十万倍，可用于洒水车，净化城市、村庄街道，净化户外空气，增加大环境的含氧量、分解空气中的有害污染物……有助于恢复环境生态平衡，有利于人体免疫力提升；稀释1000倍~10000倍，可用于居家空间的净化。
Environmental enzymes dilute 100,000 times and can be used in sprinklers to purify city and village streets, purify outdoor air, increase oxygen content in the environment and decompose harmful pollutants in the air...
净化室内空气，有利于人体免疫力的提升；稀释400倍，可用于抑菌消毒。
Purification of indoor air, is conducive to the promotion of human immunity; dilution 400 times, can be used for bacteriostasis disinfection.
根据人民网安徽频道名为《合肥市庐阳区启用雾炮车对112条主次干道喷洒环保酵素》报道显示，庐阳区城管局环管中心负责人李迎昕表示，喷洒的“环保酵素”是由“餐厨垃圾的果皮、蔬菜加入红糖和水经过发酵出来的。
Li Yingxin, head of the Luyang Municipal Administration's Environmental Protection Center, said Li Yingxin, head of the Luyang Municipal Administration's Environmental Protection Center, said the "green enzyme" sprayed by "leaven leavened from the skins and vegetables of kitchen garbage and added brown sugar and water.
”并表示“稀释后环保酵素喷洒，不会对人体有任何影响”。
"And said that" diluted environmental protection enzyme spraying, will not have any impact on the human body. "
但实际上根据目前的所知成分来看，所谓的“环保酵素”中可能会含有不可控的细菌和真菌。
But as far as is known, the so-called "environmental enzymes" may contain uncontrollable bacteria and fungi.
刘朋昕接受界面新闻采访时表示：“这是厨余垃圾发酵的产物，是细菌和真菌的代谢废物，可能含有醇类、醛类成分。
"This is the product of fermentation of food waste, metabolic waste of bacteria and fungi, and may contain alcohols and aldehydes," Liu said in an interview with the Interface News.
但是由于这是个人通过自己家的厨余垃圾做的，每家的厨余成分不同，产生的代谢废物也不同，很难精确定量，甚至可能会含有可能致癌的物质，比如黄曲霉素。
But since this is done by individuals through their own kitchen waste, each household has a different composition and produces different metabolic wastes that are difficult to quantify precisely and may even contain substances that may cause cancer, such as aflatoxin.
”“由于是发酵的产物，可能确实含有酒精，但是它里面有太多的成分不可控了，所以是绝对不能用来消毒的。
"" Because it's a product of fermentation, it may actually contain alcohol, but too much of it is out of control, so it can never be used for sterilization.
”名为酵素美人见闻录的公众号文章显示，有志愿者将100斤“环保酵素”直接投入村内水渠而大规模喷洒所谓的“环保酵素”，非但不能起到消毒作用，反而会将“环保酵素”发酵产生中的细菌不断播撒，“这样的播撒会引发一系列的问题，里面的细菌、糖分喷洒到空气，或者附着到物体表面，就像一个培养皿一样，可能会促进其他的病菌继续繁殖。
Instead of disinfecting the so-called "green enzymes," which are sprayed on a large scale by volunteers pouring 100 kilograms of "green enzymes" directly into the village canals, sowing bacteria from the fermentation of the enzyme instead of disinfecting, "causes a series of problems in which bacteria, sugar are sprayed into the air or attached to surfaces like a Petri dish, which may encourage other bacteria to reproduce.
”刘朋昕表示，即使是《新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎诊疗方案（试行第五版）》中表示可以有效灭活病毒的乙醚、75%乙醇、含氯消毒剂等成分，在非疫区也没必要大规模喷洒，“病毒没办法脱离人体长期存活”，而部分消毒剂剂具有强腐蚀性和挥发性，浓度太高容易损伤人体健康和污染环境。
Liu said that even the "pneumonia diagnosis and treatment programme for new coronavirus infections (trial version 5)" contained components such as ether, 75% ethanol and chlorine disinfectant that could effectively inactivate the virus, and no large-scale spraying was necessary in non-infected areas.
而刘朋昕的疑惑则在于各地的城管部门或环保部门，是如何接受这类没有科学验证、没有经过检疫、甚至没有经过生产许可的产品，应用到防疫中。
Liu Pengxin's doubts lie in the city administration departments or environmental protection departments around the world, how to accept such products without scientific certification, quarantine, or even production permission, to be applied in epidemic prevention.
根据《中华人民共和国传染病防治法》第二十九条规定：用于传染病防治的消毒产品、饮用水供水单位供应的饮用水和涉及饮用水卫生安全的产品，应当符合国家卫生标准和卫生规范……生产用于传染病防治的消毒产品的单位和生产用于传染病防治的消毒产品，应当经省级以上人民政府卫生行政部门审批。
According to Article 29 of the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, disinfection products used for the prevention and control of infectious diseases, drinking water supplied by drinking water supply units and products involving the sanitary safety of drinking water shall conform to state sanitary standards and norms.
具体办法由国务院制定。
Specific measures are formulated by the State Council.
此外，根据《消毒管理办法（2017）》，消毒剂生产企业取得营业执照后，还应取得所在地省级卫生计生行政部分发放的卫生许可证。
In addition, according to the Measures on the Administration of Disinfection (2017), disinfectant-producing enterprises should also obtain a health permit issued by the provincial health and family planning administration department of the locality after obtaining a business license.
而各地的“环保酵素”，皆由一个名为“酵道孝道”组织及其“志愿者”捐赠，所谓“环保酵素”多来自于个人制备，公开资料中，该产品未有任何相关卫生证明。
"Environmental enzymes" are donated by an organization called Enzyme Filial Feeding and its volunteers. Most of these enzymes are made by individuals and no health certificate is available for the product.
在此次新冠疫情前，“酵道孝道”组织曾发文表示通过“环保酵素”浸泡衣物、自制洗涤灵、自制护肤品、自制牙膏等可以“排解经皮毒”，该组织宣称日用品中含有大量化学物质，对身体造成损害，该过程称为“经皮毒”，“经皮毒”可导致乳腺癌、不孕不育及各种癌症。
Before the outbreak, Enzyme Filial Piety had sent messages saying that soaking clothes, self-made detergents, homemade skin care products and homemade toothpaste could "decontaminate" the skin by soaking clothes with "green enzymes," self-made skin care products and homemade toothpaste, a process called "dermal toxicity," which causes breast cancer, infertility and various cancers.
