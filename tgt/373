一个社区能分到多少核酸检测指标？有的时候一天能分到几个，有的时候整个街道一天也就几个。
How many nucleic acid tests can a community get? Sometimes it gets a few a day, sometimes the whole street just a few a day.
社区拿到指标后再往下分，主要就是看居民的病情谁比较严重，发烧时间早的、体温高的，先重后轻。
After the community gets the indicators, the main point is to see the residents who are more serious illness, fever early, high temperature, weight before light.
全文3534字，阅读约需7分钟做了几十年基层工作的李建宇（化名），现在是武汉市某社区的居委会主任。
Full text 3534 words, reading about 7 minutes to do grass-roots work Li Jianyu (alias), is now a community in Wuhan City of the director of the neighborhood.
从1月29日晚开始，她几乎每晚都难以合眼，因为不断有居民的电话打进来，有人是咨询问题，有人是寻求帮助，有人是希望平复内心的恐慌，“有一个人我陆陆续续陪他聊了两三个小时。
From the evening of 29 January, she found it difficult to shut her eyes almost nightly, as calls from residents continued to arrive, some asking questions, some seeking help, some hoping to calm the panic inside.
”从1月24日起，武汉开始对与新冠肺炎相关的患者实行分级分类就医制度，要求全市社区全员排查发热病人并对病情筛选、分类，不同情况不同处理。
From January 24, Wuhan began to classify patients with pneumonia related to the new crown, requiring the entire community to screen fever patients and screen and classify them according to different circumstances.
武汉市的1337个社区居委会、1814个村民委员会因此成为抗击新冠肺炎的另一条战线。
As a result, 1,337 community neighborhood committees and 1,814 villagers' committees in Wuhan have become another front in the fight against the new crown pneumonia.
从那时起，李建宇的工作更忙了。
Since then, Li's job has been much busier.
她和居委会副主任、网格员的手机要24小时开机；她和十几名社区工作人员每天都要在小区的楼宇间穿梭，用小喇叭宣传防疫常识；对着居民通讯录，挨家挨户打电话，询问家庭情况和体温；还要帮助情况各不相同的居民解决问题：要用车、要就诊、要床位、要住院。
She and a dozen community workers shuttled through the neighborhood building every day, using small loudspeakers to spread awareness of the disease, calling residents from house to house, inquiring about family and body temperature, and helping residents of all stripes with problems: cars, clinics, beds and hospitals.
李建宇说，“我也生过病，特别理解居民的心情，他恨不得把你当救命稻草。
'I've been sick, too, and I understand the mood of the residents, 'he said.' He wanted you to be a lifesaver.

以下为新京报记者与李建宇的对话。
The following is the Beijing News reporter and Li Jianyu dialogue.
━━━━━4个人，3天，5000通电话新京报：能简单介绍一下你所在的社区的情况吗？李建宇：我们社区有5000多户，近两万人。
The Beijing News: Can you give me a brief account of your community? Li Jianyu: There are more than 5,000 families in our community, nearly 20,000 people.
虽然春节期间很多居民返乡了或者出游了，仍有近万人。
Although many residents return home or travel during the Spring Festival, there are still nearly 10,000 people.
社区工作人员方面我们本来有十几个人，但有些人到外地过年了，有些因为家人生病被隔离了，将近一半不能上岗。
We had a dozen or so community workers, but some had been away for the New Year and some were quarantined because their families were sick and nearly half were unable to work.
为了支援我们，区里的机关单位和街道派了工作人员来协助我们。
To support us, the district offices and streets sent staff to assist us.
新京报：社区工作是从什么时候开始紧张起来的？李建宇：农历腊月二十九，我从电话里和（街道工作）微信群里接到通知，说要开始全天候值班。
Li Jianyu: On the 29th day of the Lunar New Year, I was notified by telephone and in the micro-mail group that I would be on duty around the clock.
因为疫情和我们之前了解的不一样，最初说不会人传人，后来说有限人传人，最后说还是会人传人。
Because the epidemic is different from what we have previously known, initially said that there will be no human-to-human, later said that the limited person-to-person, or finally said that people-to-people.
我经历过2003年“非典”，所以比较紧张。
I experienced SARS in 2003, so I was nervous.
接到通知后，我们做的第一件事就是宣传，贴出了告武汉市民的一封信、贴相关宣传资料并贴上物业公司、社区办公室等相关电话，LED屏幕也换成了与防疫相关的内容。
The first thing we did after receiving the notice was to advertise and post a letter to the citizens of Wuhan city, post relevant propaganda materials and post relevant telephone numbers of property companies, community offices, etc. LED screens were replaced with contents related to epidemic prevention.
开始有些居民比较大意、不晓得这个东西（新冠肺炎）的厉害，会相互串门，我们就要把这个东西的严重性甚至可能导致死亡都告诉他们，引起他们的高度重视，让他们待在家里不出门。
At first, some residents were careless and unaware of the severity of the disease, and would drop in on each other. We had to tell them the seriousness of the thing and possibly even cause death.
还要嘱咐他们注意防范，比如一户有一个疑似，就要说你们夫妻一定要分床睡，吃饭碗筷、洗澡、上厕所都要隔离，在家也要戴口罩。
Instruct them to take precautions, such as a suspected family, that your husband and wife must sleep separately, eat, dishwasher, bathe, toilet, and wear masks at home.
新京报：除了宣传，你们的工作还包括哪些？李建宇：很重要的一项就是摸查排找。
The Beijing News: In addition to publicity, what else does your job include? Li Jianyu: One of the most important things is to check the arrangement.
第一是要搞清楚，哪户有咳嗽的、发烧的；第二是要知道有没有外面的人进来，有没有生病的人出去，就是掌握人口的流入、流出情况；第三是要问居民里有没有出去参加过年底聚会、同学聚会的。
The first is to find out who has a cough and a fever; the second is to know if anyone from the outside has come in, if anyone is ill, to keep track of the inflow and outflow of people; and the third is to ask if any of the residents have gone out to attend an end-of-year party or class meeting.
一开始我们是上门了解，我也上过门，但后来居民有了警惕性，很多人家敲不开门，害怕，所以我们就通过电话、各种微信群、“微邻里”公众号通知。
At first we got to know each other and I went to the house, but the vigilance of the residents made it impossible for many people to open the door and be afraid, so we used the telephone, various micro-groups, "micro-neighborhood" public notice.
后来发现还是最原始的方法最管用，就发动志愿者和物业逐人打电话。
Later it turned out that the most primitive method worked best, mobilizing volunteers and property to make phone calls from person to person.
有4个工作人员就坐在社区服务中心打电话，一人一天必须打150个以上，多的一天能打到300个。
Four staff members were on the phone at the community service centre, and each had to make more than 150 calls a day, up to 300 a day.
我只给发热的、有其他症状的重点对象打，一共40多个。
I only give febrile, have other symptom key object to hit, altogether more than 40.
所有住户全部打一遍，大概要两三天。
It would take two or three days for all the occupants to fight.
现在社区里随便抽一户我们都是打过的，而且打过不止一次。
We've been in the neighborhood smoking just once and we've played it more than once.
但也有一些老年人手机是老人机，不会用线上平台，电话也打不通，就要上门询问。
But there are also a number of elderly mobile phones are elderly, will not use the online platform, the telephone is also blocked, to ask the door.
我们规定，敲门后要退到2米外，不然人家害怕你有病毒。
We require you to step back to 2 meters after knocking on the door, otherwise people will be afraid you have the virus.
还有就是一些零散的工作。
And then there's the odd jobs.
我们目前在岗的十多个人，除了有4个人每天专门打电话、接待上门的居民、填上报报表，其他人都要下去。
A dozen or so of us are now on duty, except for four people who call every day, pick up the residents, fill in the report forms, and everyone else goes down.
比如要帮孤寡老人买菜买米、送菜送米，要帮心脏病、高血压等病人买药。
For example, to help single elderly people buy vegetables, rice delivery, heart disease, hypertension and other patients to buy medicine.
还有就是到单元楼栋等公共场所消毒。
And to disinfect public places such as apartment buildings.
━━━━━排不到核酸检测的，先在家里隔离观察新京报：1月24日，武汉市新冠肺炎疫情防控指挥部发布第7号通告，实施分级分类就医服务。
Peking News: January 24, Wuhan Municipal New Crown Pneumonia Prevention and Control Command issued Circular No. 7, implementing classified medical services.
要求各社区排查发热病人，送社区医疗中心筛选，分类处理。
Communities were asked to screen febrile patients and send them to community health centres for screening and sorting.
在这个过程中，社区扮演什么样的角色？李建宇：我们接到分级筛选的任务是大年三十，但我们不是医生，最开始连体温计都没有，居民说发烧我们就相信他发烧，说不发烧我们就相信他不发烧。
Li Jianyu: We were given the task of sorting through the grades, but we were not doctors, we didn't even have a thermometer at the beginning. When residents said they had a fever we believed he had a fever.
后来筛选这一步就由街道负责了。
Later, the street was responsible for screening this step.
一般来说，病人到发热门诊看病会拍CT、进行血项检查，他们把这些检查结果拿回社区，找我们填表登记。
In general, patients go to the fever clinic to take a CT, blood test, they take the results back to the community, we fill in the form to register.
我们有一个“街道疫情防控社区工作群”，在群里把这些东西报给街道，街道再上报给区。
We have a "community work group for street epidemic prevention and control," where we report these things to the streets, which in turn report them to the district.
区里会依据各街道的情况，决定分配多少核酸检测指标给街道，街道再把这些指标分配给每个社区。
Depending on the street, the district will determine how many nucleic acid indicators will be allocated to the street, which in turn will allocate these indicators to each community.
这个流程是对的，但实际操作效率低。
This process is correct, but it is not efficient in practice.
一层一层的上报过程中，如果哪一级的领导忙着开会，没有及时看到，病人就只能等着。
At the first level of the reporting process, if the leadership at any level busy meeting, not in time to see, the patient will have to wait.
新京报：一个社区能分到多少核酸检测指标？李建宇：这个不一定。
The Beijing News: How much nucleic acid can a community get? Li Jianyu: Not necessarily.
有的时候一天能分到几个，有的时候整个街道一天也就几个。
Sometimes you get a few in a day, sometimes the whole street is just a few in a day.
我们社区差不多10个人左右做了核酸检测，其中大部分是街道派下来的指标。
Nearly 10 people in our community have had nucleic acid tests, most of which are street-based indicators.
新京报：你们社区还有多少人在排队等待检测？李建宇：截至2月1日，社区里发烧的、好了的、去世的，一共是四十多人，到现在没有一例确诊的，十几个人核酸检测结果出来的都不是。
Li Jianyu: As of February 1, there were more than 40 people in the community with fever, good or dead. So far, not a single diagnosis has been made, and a dozen or so nucleic acid tests have not been carried out.
剩下的人里，十几个想要住院，但现在排不到核酸检测，也就不能住院，我只能劝他们先在家里隔离观察。
More than a dozen of the rest wanted to be hospitalized, but now they could not be hospitalized because they did not have nucleic acid tests, so I had to persuade them to stay at home for observation.
新京报：分级分类就医后，哪些病人可以住院？李建宇：目前在社区层面，确诊的病人可以安排床位，有了床位就能住院。
Li Jianyu: At the community level, patients can now arrange beds and be hospitalized if they have beds.
床位也是区里、街道往下派指标，社区再把指标分配给病情严重的人。
Bedspace is also an indicator of the downward trend of districts and streets, and the community allocates indicators to the seriously ill.
和我们社区对口的定点医院床位比较少，1月25日-31日的统计是，能到定点医院住院的只有几个人，此外还有几个人在区里安排的医院隔离、几个人在酒店隔离。
The number of hospital beds available in our community is relatively low. From 25 to 31 January, only a few persons were admitted to the designated hospital, in addition to the isolation of a number of people in hospitals arranged by the district and the isolation of several people in hotels.
剩下的还有十几个人在家隔离，排队等着。
More than a dozen others were isolated at home, waiting in line.
当然了，隔离的、排队的人里很多不是新冠肺炎。
Of course, many of the quarantined, queued people are not new cases of pneumonia.
但有疑似症状的人都很着急。
But people with suspected symptoms are worried.
我也生过病，特别理解居民的心情，他恨不得把你当救命稻草。
I was sick, too, and he wanted to see you as a lifesaver, especially if he understood the feelings of the inhabitants.
我只能跟他们说，等确诊了，我哭也要把他们哭进去住院。
All I can tell them is, when the diagnosis is made, I'm gonna cry 'em in the hospital.
我只能用这样的办法排解居民的焦虑和怨气。
I can only use this way to relieve the residents of anxiety and resentment.
━━━━━社区做好工作病人就少了，医院就不会排长龙了新京报：社区工作人员的防护措施怎么样？李建宇：最开始的时候，我们可以说是赤手空拳，连口罩都没有，要自己从家带酒、带盐来消毒。
2008-12-12 14: 23 How about community workers' protective measuresLi Jianyu: In the beginning, we were unarmed, we didn't even have masks, and we had to disinfect ourselves with wine and salt from home.
从初一开始就有口罩送来了，第一批6个。
Masks have arrived since the beginning of junior high school, the first six.
还有一家物业公司给我们捐赠了一万个，我们就发放给居民了。
Another property company donated 10,000 to us, we gave them to the residents.
消毒水要去街道领。
The disinfectant goes to the street.
我们没有东西装消毒水，把纯净水倒掉自己开车去街道领，装回来在居民小区消毒和送发烧病人家里。
We don't have anything to disinfect, dump our purified water into the streets and drive it back to disinfect our neighborhoods and send feverish patients home.
新京报：在社区服务中心没看到工作人员穿防护服。
The Beijing News: No staff wearing protective clothing was seen at the community service centre.
李建宇：防护服我们其实是有的，但怕我们穿了，居民心里更恐慌。
Li Jianyu: We actually have protective clothing, but we are afraid of wearing it, the residents are more scared.
所以我们就把几套防护服给病人家属了，他们要去陪床，要做好防护；也有的给了接送疑似患者的司机。
So we gave some suits to the families of the patients, who were going to stay in bed and make sure they were well protected, and to the drivers who were transporting the suspected patients.
不过我们很小心，如果是疑似患者或发热病人来咨询，我们就尽量离远点，说话保持两米的距离。
But we are very careful, if the suspect or febrile patients to consult, we try to stay away from the point, talk to maintain a distance of two meters.
工作台上也放着消毒水，随时往周围喷洒。
Disinfectant water is also placed on the work table and sprayed all around at any time.
新京报：最近几天，社区的情况怎么样？李建宇：这几天有好转的趋势了，控制好了，新增病人就少些。
The Beijing News: How is the community doing in recent days? Li Jianyu: The trend has been improving in the past few days.
1月25日-31日的统计结果，社区一共有发热病患四十多人，31日新增的发热患者只有3人。
Statistics from January 25-31 showed that there were more than 40 cases of fever in the community, and only three new cases occurred on January 31.
到了2月5日，新增发热患者也只有2人，社区里大家都不再出门，邻里之间隔离得很好，所以还要严格控制人员进出，同时消毒，这很关键。
By February 5, there were only two new cases of fever, and the community was no longer out of the house and the neighbourhood was well isolated, so it was crucial to strictly control access and disinfect people.
社区做好工作，病人就少了，医院就不会排长队了。
When the community does its job well, there are fewer patients, and hospitals do not have long queues.
所以社区的工作是源头，很重要。
So the work of the community is the source, very important.
这两天，患者住院的问题也有了改善。
Over the past two days, the problem of hospitalization of patients has also improved.
火神山医院、“方舱医院”陆续投入使用，我们社区确诊的几名患者都已经入院治疗了。
The fire god mountain hospital, "square cabin hospital" successively put into use, our community confirmed several patients have been hospitalized.
十几个有发热症状的疑似患者、有发热症状的密切接触者也都到区里安排的隔离点进行了隔离和治疗。
A dozen suspected patients with fever symptoms and close contacts with fever symptoms have also been quarantined and treated at isolation points arranged by the district.
有一些密切接触者没有发病症状，不愿意隔离，我们社区就跟他们签承诺书，要求他们不出门、不干扰别人，居家隔离。
There are close contacts who are not symptomatic and do not want to be isolated, and our community signs an undertaking that they will not go out, interfere with others and live in isolation.
这些天里，白天宣传、排查新的发热患者，晚上要和街道协调，把上面说的这些人送到不同的医院治疗、隔离，其实还是很累，但不是心里累。
These days, the day propaganda, screening new fever patients, and evening coordination with the streets, the above-mentioned people sent to different hospitals for treatment, isolation, is still very tired, but not tired.
我觉得有希望了。
I think there's hope.
新京报：在社区层面，你认为工作需要哪些改进？李建宇：每个社区的医务室都应该开门。
The Beijing News: At the community level, what do you think the work needs to improve? Li Jianyu: The infirmary in every community should open.
因为现在仍然运营的是社区卫生服务中心，它们叫社区卫生服务中心，但其实隶属于街道，不是每个社区都有，我们街道只有一个。
Because there are still community health service centers, they are called community health service centers, but they belong to the street, not every community, we only have one street.
街道很大，没有车子的话，居民要走两三个公交站才能到，很不方便。
The street is very big, if do not have the car, dweller must walk two or three bus stops to arrive, very inconvenient.
如果社区医务室都能开门，不是发热的居民就可以在医务室就近打针、拿药，避免交叉感染，也减少医院的压力。
If the community infirmary can open, non-febrile residents can be in the vicinity of the infirmary injections, drugs, avoid cross-infection, and reduce the pressure on hospitals.
