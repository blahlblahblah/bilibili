纽约州确诊病例数破万，已然成为美国新冠病毒疫情的“重灾区”。
With tens of thousands of confirmed cases in New York, New York has become the worst affected area of the U. S. new crown virus outbreak.
具体到市，全美人口最多的城市——纽约市，成了这次疫情的“震中”。
In particular, New York City, the most populous city in the United States, became the epicentre of the epidemic.
迅速激增的病例数，使得纽约市医院不堪重负。
New York City hospitals are overburdened by a rapidly increasing number of cases.
3月20日，《华尔街日报》采访了20名在纽约市工作的医务人员。
On 20 March, The Wall Street Journal interviewed 20 medical personnel working in New York City.
他们当中有来自纽约最大公立医院的医生，称因防护物资短缺，他们在长达一周的时间里，都使用相同的口罩；还有一家急诊室的医生，称他们不得不重复使用防护服；另外还有医生说，一些大型医院的重症监护室（ICU）已处于“超负荷”状态；至少一家城市医院，面临呼吸机设备供应不足等问题，不得不向姊妹医院寻求帮助。
Among them were doctors from New York's largest public hospital, who said they used the same masks for a week because of shortages, an emergency room doctor who said they had to reuse protective clothing, and doctors who said the intensive care unit (ICU) in some large hospitals was "overloaded" and at least one city hospital had to turn to sister hospitals for help.

The Wall Street Journal reported that an old man died on the floor of the ward "We are suffering," says Mangala Narasimhan, a doctor at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center, a unit of New York's largest health-care system, who works for the Long Island Jewish Medical Center.
纳拉西姆表示，医院的ICU病房已人满为患，进入“超负荷”状态。
Narasim said the hospital's ICU ward was overcrowded and "overloaded."
如今她在ICU病房所看到的病人数量，是流感高峰期的三倍，其中60岁以下的病人占了相当大比例。
She now sees three times as many patients in the ICU ward as at the height of the flu, with patients under the age of 60 accounting for a significant proportion.
“过去10天，我看到的患严重呼吸系统疾病的病例，比我之前那些年见过的还要多”，纳拉西姆说。
"Over the past 10 days, I have seen more cases of severe respiratory disease than I have seen in previous years," Narasim said.
诺斯威尔健康中心的发言人特里·利纳姆（Terry Lynam）表示，近日医院已将约2500名计划出院和取消手术的病人送回家，可在这之后，19日长岛犹太医疗中心约90%的床位又都满了。
About 90% of the beds at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center were filled on the 19th, after hospitals sent home about 2,500 patients who were scheduled to be discharged and cancelled, according to Terry Lynam, spokesman for the Northwell Center for Health.
利纳姆表示，医院一半的重症监护病人都是确诊新冠肺炎患者，当下他们还在增加重症监护的床位。
Half of the hospital's intensive care patients are diagnosed with pneumonia and they are adding intensive care beds, according to Lingnan.

"I need your bed urgently," reads a memo to Queens Presbyterian Hospital on Thursday. "I need you to actively organize your patient's discharge plan."
在该院工作的医生萨奎布·拉希姆（Saquib Rahim）表示，过去一周，潜在的、确诊的病例数激增，医院里大家手忙脚乱。
Saquib Rahim, a doctor working at the hospital, said the number of potential, confirmed cases had surged over the past week and hospitals were overwhelmed.
