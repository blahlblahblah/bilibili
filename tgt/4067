这几天伊朗首都德黑兰通往外地的高速公路极其拥堵，很多民众依然坚持出行，伊朗人的心态可见一斑。
Iran's state of mind is evident in the extreme congestion on Tehran's main highway to the outside world in recent days, as many people continue to travel.
记　者 | 应　琛受访者 | 小　禹、方玉儿四川姑娘方玉儿，3月9日下午终于踏上了回国的旅程。
At the request of Ren & # 124; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & #
机场人非常少，大屏幕显示当天总共只有三个航班，除了她所乘坐的飞往郑州的航班外，还有一趟飞杭州的，以及飞往另一个国家的。
There were very few people at the airport, and the large screen showed that there were only three flights on the day, one to Hangzhou and one to another, in addition to her flight to Zhengzhou.
“大使馆能安排包机送我们回国已经很心满意足了，一切听从安排。
"The Embassy has been very satisfied with arranging for charter flights to take us back to our country.
”方玉儿说，当天在机场，她看到只有少数工作人员穿着隔离服，很多工作人员甚至连口罩都没有戴，“在登机口，伊朗地勤提供了餐食，建议我们先吃完，上了飞机全程不要摘下口罩”。
"At the airport that day, she saw only a few staff members in quarantine, many of them wearing masks," said Fang. "At the gate, Iranian ground-floor food is served, and we are advised not to remove our masks throughout the plane."
坐上摆渡车到停机坪，中国的工作人员让所有人每五六个人一组下车，测量体温和消毒之后才可以进入机舱。
On the ferry to the tarmac, Chinese staff let everyone off in groups of five or six to take temperature and disinfect before entering the cabin.

”方玉儿说，“从接到有包机可以回国的那一刻就开心得不得了，坐上飞机，更是觉得无比安心。
"I was overjoyed to get a charter flight to go back to China," Fang said, adding that it was all the more reassuring to board the plane.
”在郑州机场停机坪等待大巴转运至隔离点　方玉儿供图目前，方玉儿正在郑州接受统一隔离。

生活条件等各方面，她都很满意。
She was satisfied in every respect, including living conditions.
利用隔离期，她终于有时间整理这段日子以来积累的视频素材，“我准备剪辑一下发布”。
Using the quarantine period, she finally had time to sort out the video material she'd been amassing since that time, "I'm going to edit the release."

But anyhow, if you want to isolate, I will certainly cooperate fully, after all, the motherland has received me back, can not add trouble.
”方玉儿说。
"said Fang.
背包客的全球旅行，在伊朗中止1月29日，背包旅行的方玉儿完成了上一站的行程，从巴基斯坦走陆路入境伊朗，“海关和酒店除了问得比较细之外，倒是没有太大的阻力，因为他们看我行程知道我在巴基斯坦已经待了20多天”。
Back-packer travel around the world, January 29 in Iran, backpacker Fang Yuer completed the last leg of a journey overland from Pakistan into Iran. "Customs and hotels have not had much resistance other than to ask more details, because they see I've been in Pakistan for more than 20 days."
但普通民众却没了想象中的友好。
But ordinary people are not as friendly as they think.
方玉儿告诉《新民周刊》，她在街上遇到过有人骑着摩托车朝她大喊“中国病毒”，也遇到过被吐口水的情况，被一些餐馆、酒店、商店拒绝进入更是常事。
Fang told Xinmin Weekly that she had met people on motorbikes shouting "Chinese virus" at her on the street. She had also been spat, and it was common for restaurants, hotels and shops to refuse entry.
但也有陌生路人为自己国家有歧视行为而向她道歉，有好心的旅店老板在她行程受阻时，想方设法给予帮助。
But there were also strangers apologizing to her for the discriminatory behaviour of her country, and the kind innkeeper tried to help her when her journey was blocked.
在方玉儿看来，面对疫情伊朗人挺乐观的，他们中有人开玩笑说新冠肺炎病毒好像特别喜欢新年。
In Fang's view, the Iranians are optimistic about the outbreak, with some joking that the virus seems particularly fond of the New Year.
乐观的另一面是对疫情防控不重视。
The flip side of optimism is a lack of focus on disease prevention and control.
“伊朗人戴口罩的只有十分之一吧。
Only a tenth of Iranians wear masks.
”方玉儿说。
"said Fang.
伊朗街头戴口罩的人寥寥无几　方玉儿供图2月20日，方玉儿从伊朗第二大城市马什哈德去了亚兹德。
Few people wear masks on the streets of Iran. Fang Yuer traveled to Yazd from Mashhad, Iran's second-largest city, on February 20.
她的旅行计划原本最终目的地是非洲，她一开始打算找个居住成本比较低、人又相对较少的地方先住着，等国内疫情过去后，再继续旅行。
The ultimate destination for her trip was Africa, where she initially planned to find a place with a low cost of living and relatively few people to stay until the epidemic was over.
没想到伊朗疫情突然暴发。
I didn't expect a sudden outbreak in Iran.
2月22日，方玉儿接到在伊朗阿巴斯港的朋友的电话，让她赶紧想办法离开伊朗，“朋友说，伊朗疫情挺严重的，而且有迅速增长的势头，他们当时已经买了去土耳其的机票”。
On February 22, Fang received a phone call from her friends in the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas, asking her to find ways to leave the country. "Friends said the Iranian epidemic was serious and growing fast, and they had already bought tickets to Turkey."
除了土耳其外，方玉儿还计划过从迪拜、泰国、俄罗斯等第三国曲线回国的方案，但不是遇到航班被取消，就是需要过境签，而当地已经暂停为中国人办理过境签的情况。
In addition to Turkey, Fang has planned a curvy return programme from third countries such as Dubai, Thailand and Russia, but either flights have been cancelled or border-crossing visas are required, and there has been a local moratorium on the processing of transit visas for Chinese.
“老实说，也怪我自己一开始有些侥幸心理，觉得伊朗疫情不会很严重，不想那么轻易放弃行程。
"To be honest, I was a bit of a fluke myself at first, feeling that the Iranian epidemic was not going to be serious enough to give up the trip so easily.
后来又比较拖，迟迟没有想好怎么走，错过了离开的时机，我有朋友早些时候还是可以从第三国转机回国的。
Later, I delayed, did not think how to go, missed the opportunity to leave, I have a friend or early transit home from a third country.
”方玉儿说，因为对疫情的害怕，她一直不敢回德黑兰，因为那里人口密度还是比较高的，又离疫情最严重的库姆不远。
Fang said she had been afraid to return to Tehran because of fears about the outbreak, which is still densely populated and not far from the worst-hit city of Qom.
2月27日一早，方玉儿连夜坐了火车回到德黑兰。
Early in the morning of February 27, Fang rode the train back to Tehran overnight.
当天就看到中国驻伊朗大使馆官微推送的信息，让在伊中国人不要轻易选择从第三国回国的方式，“因为每个国家的入境政策每天都在变，也是不想造成我们的损失”。
The message sent by Chinese embassy officials in Iran that day told the Chinese not to return home from a third country "because each country's immigration policy changes every day and is not intended to cause us any loss."
但没过两天，大使馆发布消息，让在伊中国人登记个人信息，并组建了微信群。
But within two days, the embassy announced that it had allowed Chinese in Iraq to register their personal information and set up a microcosm.
“群里工作人员又发了表格让我们再登记一遍个人信息，并说可以拉认识的中国人进群。
"The group sent out another form asking us to re-register our personal information and say we could get to know the Chinese people.
”方玉儿说，那个时候她就猜测可能是会有包机回国。
At that point, she speculated, she might have chartered flights home.
在德黑兰机场办理登机　方玉儿供图果不其然，3月3日，第一批包机将滞留在库姆的留学生接回中国。
On March 3, the first charter flights picked up students stranded in Qom to take them back to China.
方玉儿坦言，在青旅等待包机的过程还是很焦虑的，她和住在这里的中国人轮流出去买菜，起初是四个人，后来又来了一些等包机的中国人，这些人说，德黑兰接待中国人的旅店并不多了。
Fang admitted she was anxious while waiting for the charter flight and took turns shopping with Chinese residents, initially four and later some chartered Chinese, who said Tehran was short of hotels for Chinese.
伊朗新年遭遇疫情，还是有人走亲访友3月20日，伊朗迎来了波斯历新年——诺鲁孜节。
Iranian New Year hits Iranian New Year Iranian relatives and friends on March 20, usher in the Persian New Year - Nowruz.
往年此时，伊朗各地大街小巷人头攒动。
At this time of year, streets and alleys swarmed across Iran.
但今年的新年对伊朗人显然不同寻常。
But this year's New Year is clearly unusual for Iranians.
截至北京时间3月20日22时，伊朗累计确诊病例19644人，累计死亡1433例。
At 2200 hours Beijing time on March 20, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in Iran was 1,9644, with a cumulative total of 1,433 deaths.
往年的诺鲁孜节　资料图按照习俗，伊朗人喜欢在新年走亲访友，或者全家外出旅游，很多人等了一年就为了全家一起去宗教圣城马什哈德朝觐许愿。
Nowruz In previous years, it is customary for Iranians to visit relatives and friends in the New Year or to travel around the family, many of whom wait for a year to make pilgrimages to the holy city of Mashhad for the family's sake.
伊朗政府和国家电视台一连数天呼吁并告诫民众，新年出行探亲访友可能会把死亡和疾病带回家。
For days, Iran's government and state television have been calling for and warning people that visiting relatives and friends on New Year's trips could bring death and disease home.
同时，因为伊朗小城市及乡镇医疗资源有限，太多民众出行很有可能会导致医疗资源紧缺。
At the same time, with limited medical resources in Iran's small cities and towns, too many people are likely to run out of resources for health care.
但这几天伊朗首都德黑兰通往外地的高速公路极其拥堵，很多民众依然坚持出行，伊朗人的心态可见一斑。
But Iran's mindset is evident in the extreme congestion that has gripped Tehran's highways to the outside world these days, with many people continuing to travel.
“因为这次疫情，政府取消了所有大型活动，包括新年相关的庆祝活动，当地的巴扎（集市）、清真寺都关了，大多数伊朗人确实也无心过年，但我出门去办签证那天，街上行人和车辆仍然不少，相信很多人还是会去走亲访友的。
"Because of the outbreak, the government canceled all major activities, including New Year-related festivities. The local Baza (bazaar) and mosque were closed and most Iranians didn't really want to celebrate the New Year.
”身处伊朗亚兹德的中国人小禹在接受《新民周刊》采访时表示。
"In an interview with Xinmin Weekly, Yu the Chinese in Yazd, Iran, said.
Play亚兹德街头大部分商店已停止营业，但因为新年的到来，仍有部分商店在营业　视频由小禹提供因为生意上的原因，小禹是大半年前到伊朗的，当时住在伊朗第三大城市伊斯法罕的朋友家。
Most of the shops on the streets of Play Yazd are closed, but some shops are still opening because of the arrival of the New Year. For business reasons, Yu the small came to Iran about half a year ago, when he lived with friends in Isfahan, Iran's third-largest city.
除了考察当地的藏红花生意之外，小禹还会利用空余时间深入小城镇用镜头记录当地的风土人情。
In addition to examining the local saffron business, Yu will use his spare time to go deep into small towns to record local customs and traditions.
他还会在“快手”上直播，或上传一些短视频。
He will also broadcast live on "Fast Hands," or upload short videos.
但伊朗新冠肺炎疫情暴发后，他也没有心思搞直播了。
But after the outbreak of pneumonia in Iran, he was in no mood for a live broadcast.
疫情前，小禹（右一）和伊朗朋友在公园的自拍　小禹供图当地时间2月19日，伊朗卫生部宣布，伊朗境内出现两例新型冠状病毒肺炎确诊病例，两名患者均来自什叶派圣城库姆。
Two confirmed cases of coronavirus pneumonia in Iran were reported by the Iranian Health Ministry on Feb. 19, 2007. Both cases came from the Shiite holy city of Qom.
随后，伊朗卫生部发言人贾汉普尔发文证实，因年龄和免疫能力等原因，两名患者已死亡。
Subsequently, Ministry of Health spokesman Jahanpur sent a letter confirming that the two patients had died due to age and immunity.
据报道，两人均为伊朗本国公民，此前既没有在海外旅行，也没有离开过库姆省。
Both were reportedly Iranian citizens who had neither previously travelled abroad nor left Qom Province.

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
但伊朗人感觉就没有这个意识，原来怎么样就还是怎么样，起初也没有人戴口罩。
But the Iranians feel like they don't have that sense, so they're just as they are, and nobody wears a mask at first.
”看到伊朗人对疫情不重视，小禹坦言自己还是比较慌的，想尽快离开。
Seeing that the Iranians were not concerned about the outbreak, Yu confessed that he was still more nervous and wanted to leave as soon as possible.
他先是前往德黑兰，一是去续签了伊朗签证，二是办理土耳其签证，看看有没有机会从德黑兰飞去土耳其。
First, he travelled to Tehran to renew his Iranian visa, and second, to obtain a Turkish visa to see if he had a chance to fly from Tehran to Turkey.
伊朗疫情暴发时空空如也的火车　小禹供图但当小禹拿到土耳其签证时，新闻宣布伊朗和土耳其间的航班都被取消了。
When Yu was given a visa to Turkey, the news announced that flights between Iran and Turkey had been canceled.
“差不多时间，德黑兰当地政府下令关闭一些酒店，我住的酒店也不接待新入住的中国人了。
"About the same time, the local government in Tehran ordered the closure of some hotels, and my hotel did not receive new Chinese residents.
”鉴于这种情况，3月初，小禹坐火车前往亚兹德，“一方面，我有朋友在那里开民宿，那边生活成本也比德黑兰低一些；另一方面，亚兹德算是伊朗的一个古城，人口不多，以本地人为主，没什么游客，人口流动也相对较少”。
In view of this situation, Yu travelled by train to Yazd in early March. "On the one hand, I had friends who stayed there and the cost of living there was lower than in Tehran.
出发前，小禹在德黑兰买到两个一次性口罩，“差不多人民币四五元一个，后面就买不到了”。
Before setting out, Xiao Yu bought two disposable masks in Tehran, "about RMB 4, 5 yuan a day, the back can not buy."
由于口罩的稀缺，他的第一个口罩戴了差不多近半个月，“舍不得换新的，直到在亚兹德朋友给了我一些口罩后，我才换了新口罩”。
His first mask was worn for almost half a month because of the scarcity of masks. "I was reluctant to replace them until my friend gave me some masks."
小禹告诉记者，他现在非必要就不出门。
Xiao Yu told reporters that he must not go out now.
除了超市、药店等这些必要的商店正常营业之外，很多店铺都已经关门了，而他住的民宿也不对外营业了。
In addition to the essential stores, such as supermarkets and pharmacies, many shops were closed and his lodgings were closed.
比较棘手的是，小禹的签证3月23日即将到期，“我看群里，有说法是目前的情况签证会自动续签三个月，也有说法是很多人被拒签了”。
To make matters worse, Yu's visa is due to expire on March 23rd. "In my opinion, it is said that the current situation will automatically renew the visa for three months, also said that many people have been refused a visa."
3月18日，亚兹德旅游局一行人来到该民宿慰问华人。
On March 18, a group from the Yazd Tourist Office came to the residential area to offer sympathy to the Chinese.
当得知小禹的情况后，旅游局局长写了一张纸条给签证中心，希望能尽量帮助解决小禹的签证问题。
When learning of Yu's situation, the director of MGTO wrote a note to the visa center, hoping to help solve the visa problem of Yu.

On March 19, Xiao Yu and his friends went to the visa center with a note to see if it could be successfully carried out.
无奈，遇上波斯新年，签证中心已经放假。
Helpless, meet Persian New Year, visa center has been closed.
亚兹德街头车流攒动，有少部分人戴着口罩　小禹供图选择留守当地，估计疫情要持续到4月“等他们上班了，我再去问问。
Yazd Streetcar flow, a small number of people wearing masks Yu small map to stay behind, estimated that the epidemic will continue until April "When they work, I will ask.
”小禹说，之前他非常迫切想回国，但因为种种原因错过了中国驻伊朗大使馆的包机，“反正我已经在大使馆那里登记过了，如果还有包机再说。
"Yu said he was anxious to return home, but for various reasons missed the charter flight of the Chinese embassy in Iran." I have registered with the embassy anyway, if there are any charter flights.
尤其是看到大批海外华人这个时候回国，给国内疫情防控增加了不小的压力，我的想法改变了，心态也积极了许多，我觉得只要在这里不出门，自我隔离，做好防护就可以了”。
Especially to see a large number of overseas Chinese returned home at this time, to increase the pressure on domestic epidemic prevention and control, my thinking has changed, the mentality has been much more positive, I feel as long as here do not go out, self-isolation, good protection is enough.
据伊通社报道，伊朗卫生部发言人贾汗普尔表示，现在伊朗疫情非常严峻，医疗物资也很缺乏，一些民众不予合作，导致伊朗平均每小时就有50人感染病毒。
A spokesman for Iran's health ministry, Mohammad Jahanpur, said the country was suffering from a severe outbreak, a lack of medical supplies and a lack of cooperation from some citizens, which has left Iran infected with the virus at an average of 50 people an hour, IINA reported.
他呼吁民众要遵守卫生部的建议，尽量避免外出。
He urged people to abide by the health ministry's advice and avoid going out.
伊朗卫生部副部长阿里雷扎·雷西18日再次发出严重警告称，如果每个人都能遵守相关指示，自我居家隔离两周，或者根据规章制度按需外出，那将对遏制疫情有很大帮助，“这两周（伊朗新年假期）是绝佳机会。
Iran's deputy health minister, Ali Reza Rasi, yesterday reiterated a serious warning that two weeks of home confinement or a two-week stay-at-home stay-at-home visit, or an on-demand trip according to regulations, would go a long way toward containing the epidemic.
如果没抓住这个机会，那么接下来的两个月或许更长时间，我们将不得不继续同新冠病毒作斗争，造成更多损失”。
If we fail to seize this opportunity, we will have to continue to fight the new crown virus for the next two months or more, causing even more damage.
伊朗官员透露，卫生部预计确诊病例将在未来数周持续增长，峰值或出现在4月8日。
Iranian officials say the ministry expects confirmed cases to continue to grow in the coming weeks, peaking on April 8.
对于医务人员提议的封城措施，伊朗最高国家安全委员会已经表示了拒绝。
Iran's Supreme National Security Council has rejected medical staff's proposed closures.

小禹坦言，他对伊朗的疫情不是很乐观，“感觉要到4月底才会达到峰值。
Yu admitted he was not optimistic about the situation in Iran, "feeling it will not peak until the end of April."
