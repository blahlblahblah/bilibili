作者 | 第一财经吴将截至1月31日早上8点，新型冠状病毒肺炎仍在发酵——除了湖北省各市之外，最严重的城市新增确诊病例55例，累计227例，不但远超北京、上海，甚至还超过了紧邻湖北、人口众多、地缘辽阔的重庆（206例），高居全国第六——你可能不一定会想到，这座城市竟是远离武汉千里之外的温州。
By 8 a.m. on January 31, the new coronavirus pneumonia is still fermenting - 55 new cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in cities other than Hubei province, totaling 227 cases, far outstripping Beijing and Shanghai and possibly the sixth-largest city in the country (206 cases) - a city thousands of miles away from Wuhan.
那么为何，温州这次会成为疫情重灾区？湖北是温州人的“第二故乡”？首先，很多人可能并不了解，温州地区其实是全国人口最密集的区域之一。
So why, this time, will Wenzhou be the epicenter of the epidemic? Hubei is Wenzhou's "second home"? First, many people may not realize that Wenzhou is actually one of the most densely populated areas in the country.
温州全市常住人口为925万人，位居浙江省第二，仅次于杭州的980万。
Wenzhou has a resident population of 9.25 million, ranking second in Zhejiang Province and 9.8 million next to Hangzhou.
人口密度为774人/平方公里，是全国的5.5倍，全省的1.4倍。
Population density was 774 persons per square kilometre, 5.5 times the national rate and 1.4 times that of the entire province.
在人口密度最高的鹿城区，达到4399人/平方公里。
In Lucheng, the most densely populated area, 4,399 people per square kilometre was reached.
再加上浙江省“七山二水一分田”的地形特点，近千万温州人口都集中在东部沿海的少量平原地段，因此实际上的人口密集程度远比统计数据上显示的更大。
Add to that the topography of the "Qishan-Er-shui-paddy field" in Zhejiang Province, where nearly 10 million Wenzhou's population is concentrated in a small number of plain areas along the eastern coast, so the actual population density is much higher than indicated by the statistics.
另一方面，改革开放后，温州人以热衷抱团经商而闻名于世。
On the other hand, after reform and opening up, Wenzhou people are famous for their zeal to conduct business.
据悉，全球各地有200多万温州商人，其中在湖北就超过20万，主要集中在武汉，因此不少温州商人把湖北或武汉称为“第二故乡”。
It is reported that there are more than two million Wenzhou businessmen, including more than 200,000 in Hubei, mainly in Wuhan, so many Wenzhou businessmen refer to Hubei or Wuhan as their "second hometown.
1月29日，温州市副市长汤筱疏在新闻发布会表示，确诊人数猛增与武汉返温的人员基数大有关：“在武汉经商、就学和务工的，有18万温州人。
The surge in the number of confirmed cases has to do with the large number of people returning to Wuhan, said Tang Xiaoshu, deputy mayor of Wenzhou city, at a news conference on January 29.
”汤筱疏称：“截至目前，温州已排查出武汉及其周边回温3.3万人，这与温州发病曲线和回温人员高潮成正比的。
"So far, Wenzhou has sorted out 33,000 people in and around Wuhan, which is directly proportional to the Wenzhou onset curve and the climax of the temperature-returning personnel," said Tang.
源头阻断任务很重，武汉封城后，1月23日至27日5天，仍旧有1.88万人从湖北特别是武汉到达温州，平均每天有3600多人。
The task of blocking the source is very heavy. After the closure of Wuhan city, from January 23 to 27, 18,800 people still arrived in Wenzhou from Hubei, especially Wuhan, with an average of 3,600 people per day.
”一位在武汉从事服装生意的朋友对第一财经记者表示，在武汉的温州人以经商为主，如果他们有回家过年的打算，通常不会等到法定假日，而是提前数日返温，以避开春运。
A friend in the Wuhan clothing business told the first financial reporter that Wenzhou people in Wuhan were mainly in business, and if they had plans to go home for the New Year, they would not usually wait for an official holiday but would return a few days earlier to avoid the Spring Festival holiday.
由于春节前一周，疫情尚未全面爆发，当时从武汉返温并不会受到任何阻碍，也不用测体温，或许这正是造成春节后温州疫情瞬速爆发的重要原因之一。
Since the outbreak was not over-blown a week before the Spring Festival, there was no impediment to returning from Wuhan and no temperature measurements, which may have been one of the main causes of the Wenzhou epidemic.
人情往来越频密风险越高温州的商人们爱抱团，这已是公开的秘密，也是他们事业有成的要素之一。
The higher the risk of human contact, the more likely it is that businessmen in Wenzhou will cling to each other, an open secret and a factor in their success.
由于温州自古地处偏僻、交通不便、方言复杂，加上地方又不大，因此每个县城、乡镇都很容易形成一个典型的“熟人社会”。
Because Wenzhou is remote from ancient times, the traffic is not convenient, the dialect is complex, and the place is not big, so every county and township can easily form a typical "acquaintances' society."
在“熟人社会”里，人与人之间都被一张巨大而紧密的关系网链接在一起，因为随时可能与自己的利益相关，所以人与人之间的关系尤为重要，大家都会不约而同地努力去维护，而家族内部、亲戚之间的关系无疑更是重中之重——春节前后集体聚餐、拜年、相互串门正是维持这种“人情”关系的核心手段。
In an "acquaintance society," where people are connected by a huge and close network of connections, and because they may have interests at all times, people-to-people relationships are particularly important, and relationships within and between families are undoubtedly the most important - group meals, New Year visits and mutual visits around Spring Festival are central to maintaining this "human bond."
显然在大多数时候，抱团都会是一种优势，可以互补长短。
Obviously, most of the time, clustered together is an advantage that can complement each other.
但在防疫阶段，这却是一个巨大的隐患。
But in the epidemic prevention stage, this is a huge hidden danger.
试想一下，通常情况下，一位已婚的温州中年男子在过年期间仅在近亲内部就至少要参加四次聚餐，即父亲一系、母亲一系、岳父一系、岳母一系。
Imagine a married Wenzhou middle-aged man attending at least four meals during the Chinese New Year just within the immediate family, father-in-law, mother-in-law and mother-in-law.
这还不算拜访可能在邻县的远亲、亲朋好友的婚礼、孩子满月酒、搬迁新居等等。
This is in addition to visiting distant relatives, relatives and friends who may be in a neighboring county, children full moon wine, moving new homes, etc.
按照温州当地的习俗，以上都要摆酒、聚餐，如果无故缺席，则会让亲人“脸上无光”。
According to Wenzhou local customs, all of the above to put out wine, dinner, if there is no reason to be absent, will let relatives "disgrace."
此外，节后去给每一位长辈拜年也是必不可少的流程。
In addition, after the festival to give each elder a New Year call is also an essential process.
粗略一算，整个流程下来，一位已婚温州中年男子在过年期间会接触到的亲戚人数起码在50人以上。
A rough calculation, the whole process down, a married Wenzhou middle-aged men in the Chinese New Year will be exposed to at least 50 relatives.
可想而知，如果其中一人是病毒感染者，其他人被感染的风险会有多高，并将给防疫工作带来多大的困难。
It is conceivable that if one of them is infected with the virus, the risk of other people being infected will be high, and how difficult it will be to prevent the disease.
市民此前防疫意识不足据第一财经记者的亲身经历，春节前夕，温州下属的某人口大县县城，并无看到任何疫情预防措施，聚餐、聚会也照常进行，街上人来人往，未见有人戴口罩。
On the eve of the Spring Festival, no epidemic prevention measures were observed in one of Wenzhou's most populous county and county capitals. Meals and gatherings were also held as usual, and no one was seen wearing masks.
1月25、26日，温州确诊人数开始暴涨时，当地县政府才关闭了大部分的公共场所，并宣布取消一切大型文体、集会等活动。
When the number of people diagnosed in Wenzhou began to skyrocket on January 25 and 26, local county authorities closed most public areas and announced the cancellation of all major sporting, cultural, sporting and other events.
尽管如此，当时市民们的防疫意识仍然不够。
Nevertheless, the population was not sufficiently sensitized at the time.
第一财经记者27日上街发现戴口罩的人数不足五成，人潮涌动的菜市场也照常开放，没有任何管制或测体温等措施，只有多家仍在营业的知名快餐品牌连锁店员工全部带上了医用防护口罩。
First Financial Reporter No. 27 found that less than 50% of the people wearing masks, the surge in the market is also open as usual, no control or temperature measures, only a number of well-known fast food brand chain staff are still wearing medical masks.
另据身边一位友人透露，尽管26日麻将室等公众娱乐场所已被禁止营业，但仍有个别麻将室私下偷偷开门，据其称，当时他发现一家麻将室的后门开着，进去一看发现一间10平方米左右的麻将室聚集了6~7个人，且其中近半人没有戴口罩。
According to one friend, although Mahjong rooms and other public entertainment venues have been closed on the 26th, some private mahjong rooms have been opened secretly, he said, when he found a Mahjong room open the back door, found a 10-square-meter Mahjong room gathered 6-7 people, nearly half of whom were not wearing masks.
后来，因被举报，这间麻将室才被迫停业。
The Mahjong room was later forced to close down after being reported to the police.
1月29日，温州累计确诊人数超过了100人。
On January 29, more than 100 people were diagnosed in Wenzhou.
当地县政府终于对菜市场加紧的防范，只留了下一个出入口，并安排了人员测体温。
The local county government finally stepped up its precautions on the Halles market, leaving only the next entrance, and arranged for a temperature check.
当晚，温州政府宣布关闭14个高速出口。
That evening, Wenzhou government announced the closure of 14 high-speed exports.
同日，温州乐清市公安局披露称，“该市3名不配合新型冠状病毒感染肺炎疫情防控工作的市民均被处以行政拘留。
On the same day, the Wenzhou Yueqing City Public Security Bureau disclosed that "three residents of the city who do not cooperate with the new coronavirus infection pneumonia prevention and control work were sentenced to administrative detention.
”其原因是，三名从湖北返乡的人员，在观察期间离开家里到公共场所活动，带来疫情防控风险。
The reason is that three people returning home from Hubei province left their homes to take part in activities in public places during the observation period, posing a risk of disease prevention and control.
1月30日，第一财经记者注意到县城各大小区都被安排了出入口控制及测体温人员，街上超过95%以上的人都戴上了口罩。
On January 30, the first financial reporter noticed that all districts and districts of the county were equipped with access control and temperature control personnel, and more than 95 percent of the people in the street wore masks.
截至1月31日早上9点30分，温州共确诊227例、重症14例、治愈出院7例，暂无死亡病例。
Up to 9: 30 a.m. on January 31, Wenzhou has confirmed 227 cases, 14 cases of severe illness, 7 cases of cured discharge, and no death cases.
温州人民正在努力和病毒就生存的权力进行斗争，希望疫情拐点尽快到来。
Wenzhou people are struggling with the virus on the right to exist, hope that the inflection point of the epidemic as soon as possible.
