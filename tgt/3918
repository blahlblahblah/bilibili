这一代的大学生，喜欢在与课程同步的留言板上留言，同时纷纷默契地关闭了自己那一侧的摄像头（我也没有要求他们开放摄像头）。
This generation of college students, who like to post messages on the course's syncopated message board, have tacitly closed their side of the camera (and I did not ask them to open it).
文 |张　鹏我是1月27日（大年初三）从江苏老家和太太自驾返回上海的。
Zhang Peng I returned to Shanghai from my hometown and wife in Jiangsu Province on January 27 (New Year's Day).
当天17：00左右，车行到崇启大桥入沪检查站大约两公里外，前方车辆已开始排队等待检查后入沪。
At about 17: 00 on the same day, the bus to Chongqi Bridge into the Shanghai checkpoint about two kilometers away, the front of the vehicle has been waiting to check into Shanghai.
高速上的电子显示屏远远地提示“前方防疫检查请保持秩序”，因刹车原因，眼前看不到头的各种车辆红色尾灯和显示屏上的红色字幕抢眼地揉叠在一起。
The electronic display screen on the high-speed signal "keep order ahead of the epidemic prevention inspection," because of braking reasons, do not see the end of the various vehicles red tail lights and red subtitles on the screen eye-folded together.
当时的心情里，有一种被卷入未知的感觉，我知道，所有人都正在“见证一段共和国防疫史、交通史、城市史”。
There was a feeling of being involved in the unknown, and I knew that everyone was "witnessing a period of republican epidemic prevention, traffic history, urban history."
这段时间里我能做些什么？这个问题从那一刻开始萦绕心头。
The question of what I could do during this time began to haunt me.
返沪时看到的“前方防疫检查请保持秩序”　第一个十四天：“有点方”　年初二大家庭商议后，取消了春节一切聚会计划。
On your return to Shanghai, please keep order during the first 14 days. After consultation with the extended family, all plans for the Spring Festival get-together were cancelled.
初二晚专门和八十五岁高龄的爷爷（当时爷爷住在三叔家）见了一面后，我们决定提前返沪，并得到了长辈们一致支持。
On the night of the second day of the special and 85-year-old grandfather (grandfather at that time lived in the third uncle) met, we decided to return to Shanghai early, and received the unanimous support of the elders.
我们同时决定，到沪后自觉在家十四天，尽量减少出门概率，既保护自己，也保护家人，尽管那时上海的气氛实际上还没有特别紧张，也没有明确的从江苏回沪后一定不能出门的规定。
At the same time, we decided to stay at home for 14 days, minimize the probability of leaving home and protect ourselves and their families, even though the atmosphere in Shanghai was not really tense at that time.
1月28日早上，武汉市的确诊数据从前天的698例升至1590例，上涨了一倍以上，全国各地的数据也在增长。
On the morning of January 28, the number of confirmed cases in Wuhan more than doubled to 1,590 from 698 the previous day, and the figures were growing across the country.
1月底那几天，其实还是可以在做好个人防护、测体温和出示教工身份证明的前提下进入校园的，去学校的路上已行人稀少，每个人都戴着口罩。
At the end of January, it was still possible to enter the campus with personal protection, body temperature and proof of identity. The roads to school were scarce and everyone wore masks.
到了2月5日，学校正式开始封闭式管理，一般教师需要通过OA系统申请（一般至少需要提前一天）后，才能临时进校。
By February 5, the school officially closed management, ordinary teachers through the OA system (usually at least a day in advance) before temporary admission.
而更重要的事情，是1月底开始，教育部明确“利用网络平台，‘停课不停教、不停学’”的新学期全面网络教学的方针后，对我们这些高校教师的影响。
More importantly, since the end of January, the Ministry of Education has made it clear that the new semester-long policy of "non-stop teaching and non-stop learning, using web-based platforms," will have an impact on our college teachers.
当然，客观而言，从整个教育事业的角度看，首先是对中小学教师和中小学生们的影响。
Objectively, of course, from the point of view of the whole educational undertaking, the first is the impact on primary and secondary school teachers, pupils and students.
很快，2月7日和2月8日，学校出台了“2020年春季学期本科生教学方案”和“2020年春季研究生教学方案”。
Soon, on February 7 and February 8, schools launched the "2020 Spring Semester Undergraduate Teaching Program" and the "2020 Spring Postgraduate Teaching Program."
方案主要强调：“教师应于2月28日之前做好相应线上教学准备。
"Teachers should be ready to teach online by February 28," the plan stresses.
上课时间应按既定课表限定的时段正常授课，以免造成不同课程之间的冲突。
Classes should be conducted regularly within the time limits set by the established curriculum, so as not to create conflicts between the different courses.
”并计划从2月11日起开始为期一周的线上课程建设培训，以及培训完成后为期两周的教师自主建课。
It also plans to begin a week-long online coursebuilding training on February 11 and a two-week self-help course for teachers once the training is completed.
事实证明，这样的调整是紧扣住了时间节点，使得3月2日的正式网络教学阶段有了保证。
This proved to be a time-critical adjustment that guaranteed the formal e-learning phase on March 2.
当然，刚刚接触网课建设的时候，作为教师也是“有点方”，记得那会儿关于网络教学的段子也是层出不穷。
Of course, just contact the network when the construction of lessons, as a teacher is also "a bit square," remember that the time of network teaching is endless.
我去做了社区志愿者　2月5日学校的全面封闭式管理十天后，2月16日起，我所在的小区正式开始出入证管理制度。
After 10 days of comprehensive closed management by community volunteers on February 5, my neighborhood officially began to operate a pass management system on February 16.
记得那天天气很冷，出入证领取处就在进入公寓大楼的门厅处，我和太太从社区志愿者手里领到了绿色的纸质出入证，这显然是更加严格管理小区进出的标志。
I remember that it was a cold day and my wife and I got green paper passes from community volunteers in the lobby of the building where the access card was issued. This was a clear sign of stricter control over access to the area.
实际上，所在小区在1月底就已经全面实施唯一进出口控制，测体温和快递无接触安排也在发证之前就已实现，发放出入证，使管理显得更加规范。
In fact, the only import and export controls in the area had been fully implemented by the end of January, and arrangements for temperature and express delivery non-contact had been in place prior to the issuance of passes, making management more regulated.
但看到发放出入证的过程，使我更添了一分“我能为社区做点什么”的想法。
But the process of issuing a pass added to my list of ideas about what I can do for the community.
其实我们这些大学老师，平时工作主要是围着学校和学生转，对社区事务，几乎没有太多了解。
In fact, we university teachers, usually work around the school and students, little understanding of community affairs.
但是，眼看到社区志愿者队伍的不容易，再加上在家里实在是待得久了，准备网课这时也略有了一点儿心得，我就想试试和社区取得联系，加入志愿者队伍。
However, seeing the community volunteer team is not easy, and is really staying at home for a long time, the preparation of the network lessons at this time also a little bit learned, I would like to try to contact the community, join the volunteer team.
和太太一说，她也很快就同意了，不过要求我戴上两层口罩进行防护，以及穿一件厚外套防风。
After talking to my wife, she quickly agreed, but asked me to wear a two-layer mask for protection and a thick coat to protect me from the wind.
我去找了社区书记，怎么有联系方式的呢，这还是两年前在职党员到社区登记时留的。
I went to the community secretary. How can I get in touch with him? That was two years ago when the incumbent registered with the community.
社区的陆书记表示欢迎我能加入志愿者队伍，并很快将我拉入了社区志愿者群。
The community secretary Lu welcomed me as a volunteer and quickly brought me into the community volunteer corps.
当时志愿者群里一共有20人，后来慢慢壮大了一些。
At that time, there were 20 people in the volunteer group, but it grew a little stronger.
二月中下旬的上海，早上的天气还真的凉。
It was really cold this morning in Shanghai in the second half of February.
社区书记和社区主任将“最好的防护设备”——街道办事处配给社区办公室的亮色防风雨衣借给了我，所以才有了以下这张照片。
The community secretary and the community director lent me the "best protective equipment" - bright raincoats assigned to the community office by the neighborhood office - which led to the following photo.
做社区志愿者时指导来访者登记我的工作也挺简单，主要是登记来访者和非绿卡住户。
Working as a community volunteer to instruct visitors to sign up for my job is also quite simple, mainly to register visitors and non-green card households.
但在志愿工作的过程中，也发现确实有个别住户并不配合，有些登记人员也故意不写全相关信息。
In the course of volunteer work, however, it has also been found that individual households do not cooperate and that some registrars deliberately omit all relevant information.
这个时候，也只能相对严格一些。
At this time, can only be relatively strict.
回想起来，好在我还算有一些教学经验，说服别人的能力还是用上了的。
In retrospect, I still have some teaching experience, but the ability to persuade others is still in use.
当然，在这样的特殊时期，大多数居民是非常配合志愿者工作的。
Of course, at special times like this, most residents work very cooperatively with volunteers.
网络教学阶段的返校值班　3月2日起，我所在高校的网络教学阶段正式开始了，这个不一样的开学值得铭记。
Since March 2, the online teaching phase of my university has officially started, and this different beginning of the school year is worth remembering.
准备教学阶段自行制作的网络教学平台通知这学期我承担有一些课程，同时学校也希望各校内二级单位有教师到班值守，我进入了3月到校总值班的教师名单。
I have taken a number of courses this semester, and I hope to have teachers on duty in the second-level units. I have entered the list of teachers who will be on duty in March.
能够返校工作，心情还是很不错的。
Can go back to work, the mood is still very good.
我所在的学校，校方推荐的课程资源管理平台有三种，视频教学（点播&直播）平台有五种，教师可以选用和组合这些平台并报教务处，负责教务工作的老师们再统一向同学们发布，同学们对照课表，在上课时间进入教师开放的平台系统，就可以开始课程了。
At my school, there are three types of course resource management platforms recommended by the university. Teachers can choose and assemble these platforms and report them to the Registry. The faculty members responsible for the teaching profession then issue them to their classmates. Students can begin classes by accessing the teacher-friendly platform system during school hours, against the curriculum.
由于有之前的教学测试和相对充分的教学准备，我这两周的网络教学还是相对顺利的。
Due to the previous teaching test and relatively adequate preparation for the teaching, my two-week online teaching is relatively smooth.
和正式在课堂里教学相比较，主要的感觉是上课节奏还是要快一些，教师自己讲的比例要大幅提高。
Compared with formal classroom teaching, the main feeling is that the pace of the class is still faster, the proportion of teachers themselves to significantly increase.
毕竟，这还不是真正的课堂教学环境，大家的互动性还是要打些折扣。
After all, this is not a real classroom environment, we should be interactive or discount.
由于是开着视频授课，我告诉同学们我在学校办公室，保证了网速和不会有家里的孩子来干扰，有些同学对我现在就能返校表示“有些羡慕”。
As I was teaching on video, I told my classmates that I was in the school office, guaranteed speed and no interference from my children, and some of them were "a little envious" that I would be able to return to school now.
这一代的大学生，喜欢在与课程同步的留言板上留言，同时纷纷默契地关闭了自己那一侧的摄像头（我也没有要求他们开放摄像头）。
This generation of college students, who like to post messages on the course's syncopated message board, have tacitly closed their side of the camera (and I did not ask them to open it).
作为老师，对着电脑开展课程讲授和知识点讲解，有时候还得念一遍同学们在留言板上的提问再作回答，当然会有点“莫名的忧伤”。
As a teacher, the computer to carry out the course lectures and knowledge, sometimes have to read students in the message board to answer the question, of course, a little "inexplicable sadness."
其实作为高校教师中的一员，我想我们中的大多数当然不那么想成为“主播”，还是盼望病毒早日“退散”，让我们能够有正常的授课和工作环境。
As a member of the faculty, I think most of us certainly do not want to be "anchors" or look forward to an early "rollback" of the virus so that we can have a normal classroom and working environment.
现在，校园里春意已渐浓，国内战胜新冠病毒的好消息也不断传来，战“疫”在全世界层面已进入下半场。
Now, the campus is growing in spring, the good news of the domestic victory over the new crown virus, the "epidemic" has entered the second half of the world.
我们期盼的，一是希望同学们能够早日平安、健康地返回校园，二是包括同学们在内的全体中国人，有更强大的独立思考和明辨是非的能力。
We hope that first, students can return to school safely and healthily at an early date, and second, that all Chinese people, including students, will have a stronger ability to think independently and distinguish right from wrong.
