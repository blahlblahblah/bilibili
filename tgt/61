Editing Lee & # 160; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
1976年9月中旬，这里的一间小教会医院接纳了几十例相同病例，他们身体所有开孔都流血不止，甚至双眼也在出血。
In mid-September 1976, a small ecclesiastical hospital admitted dozens of similar cases, bleeding from all the openings in their bodies and even bleeding from their eyes.
修女和牧师躲在一间宾馆内，门口用绳子挡住来访者，绳子上还挂着一块牌子，上写：“请勿入内，进入可能导致死亡。
The nuns and the pastor were hiding in a hotel, the door of which was blocked by a rope with a sign that read: "Do not enter, entry may result in death.
”一位医生在救治一个垂死的修女时采集了血液样本并带到了扎伊尔首都金沙萨，一路又搭飞机带回比利时，交给病毒学家彼得·皮奥。
"A doctor treating a dying nun collected blood samples and took them to Kinshasa, Zaire, where he flew back to Belgium to be delivered to virologist Peter Piot.
通过电子显微镜，皮奥观察到了一大群蛇形的病毒。
Through an electron microscope, Piot observed a swarm of snake-shaped viruses.
在此之前，病毒学家只知道另一种蛇形的病毒——马尔堡病毒。
Before that, virologists knew only about the Marburg virus, another snake-like virus.
皮奥立刻意识到，出现在扎伊尔的致命疾病可能给人类带来非常大的灾难。
Piot immediately realized that the deadly disease in Zaire could wreak havoc on mankind.
他告知科学家们共同赶赴扎伊尔，并最终抵达扬布库村。
He told the scientists to travel together to Zaire and eventually to the village of Yangbuku.
由于这种病毒史借助受害者体液进行传播，在关闭了医院，隔离了有症状的人后，疫情得到了控制，但还是导致了318人在这场瘟疫中死亡。
The virus's history of transmission through the body fluids of the victims, the closure of hospitals and the isolation of symptomatic persons brought the outbreak under control, but led to 318 deaths in the epidemic.
为了不让扬布库背负恶名，皮奥把目光投向当地的一条河流，并将其命名为：埃博拉。
To keep him out of the limelight, Piot set his sights on a local river and named it Ebola.
埃博拉只是短暂地消失了，3年后它在苏丹卷土重来，造成34人死亡，1994年又在加蓬发起了攻击，造成52人死亡。
Ebola had only briefly disappeared, and three years later it had returned in the Sudan, killing 34 people and, in 1994, in Gabon, where 52 people had died.
进入人类历史的最初37年里，埃博拉病毒总是悄无声息地爆发，而后随着宿主死亡或康复消失殆尽。
For the first 37 years of human history, the Ebola virus has erupted quietly, and then disappeared as the host died or recovered.
2013年12月，埃博拉病毒在几内亚一个小村里开始传播，在全球范围总共导致超过28500人感染，11300余人死亡，平均死亡率约为50%，在部分非洲疫区死亡率甚至高达90%，而这也是史上爆发的最大且最复杂的埃博拉疫情。
In December 2013, the Ebola virus began to spread in a small village in Guinea, causing a total of more than 28,500 infections, more than 11,300 deaths globally, with an average mortality rate of about 50 per cent and, in some African epidemics, as high as 90 per cent, the largest and most complex Ebola outbreak in history.
即便是在今天，人们利用计算机也很难准确预测下一次埃博拉疫情将会发生在哪里，能做的只是通过每一次疫情爆发增进对埃博拉病毒的了解。
Even today, it is difficult to predict exactly where the next Ebola outbreak will occur, and all that can be done is to improve understanding of the virus through each outbreak.
在非洲，野生动物是肉食类来源之一，尤其在农村，像猩猩、猴子和蝙蝠都是他们主要的狩猎对象。
In Africa, wild animals are a source of meat, especially in rural areas, where orangutans, monkeys and bats are their main hunting targets.
也正是通过这样的方式，埃博拉病毒多次从丛林走向村庄，最后走向城市。
It is also in this way that the Ebola virus has repeatedly moved from the jungle to the village and finally to the city.
作为一种古老的病毒，我们至今对埃博拉依旧陌生。
As an ancient virus, we are still new to Ebola.
掉落人间的病毒2002年12月初，在深圳打工的河源市人黄杏初感觉不舒服，就像是风寒感冒，于是去附近的诊所和医院打针，一直不好，10天后被送到河源市人民医院，病情加剧，呼吸困难，被送到广州军区总医院。
At the beginning of December 2002, Huang Xingchu, a resident of Heyuan city who worked in Shenzhen, felt sick at first. He went to a nearby clinic and hospital to get shots.
人类并不认识这种疾病，最初的病人隔离措施也不到位，很多医生和护士也纷纷受到感染。
Humans are unaware of the disease, initial patient isolation measures are not in place, and many doctors and nurses are infected.
就这样，传染病在众多国家和地区相继暴发，而这种不明原因的传染病则被称为“非典型肺炎”，英文名简称：SARS。
As a result, outbreaks of infectious diseases have occurred in many countries and regions, and this unidentified infectious disease has been called SARS.
一个月后，香港大学和美国疾病预防控制中心先后分离出SARS致病病原，这个病毒在电子显微镜下看起来就像一顶帝王的皇冠。
A month later, the University of Hong Kong and the Centers for Disease Control in the United States isolated the SARS pathogen, which looked like a crown of kings under an electron microscope.
小小的“皇冠”随后表现出千斤的重量，从广东首次爆发，短短5个月之内蔓延，这场21世纪初最严重传染病最终在2003年7月停止了肆虐的脚步，共造成8096人感染，774人死亡。
The little crown then spread in just five months from Guangdong's first outbreak, ending in July 2003 with 8,096 people infected and 774 killed by the worst epidemic of the early 21st century.
对SARS病毒的溯源却由此往后持续了十年之久，中科院武汉病毒所研究员石正丽团队也最终将SARS病毒的天然宿主追踪至中华菊头蝠。
Since then, the virus has been traced back more than a decade, and the team of Wuhan virus researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences has finally traced the natural hosts of the virus to Chinese chrysanthemum bats.
“尽管这么多年来SARS没有卷土重来，但在自然界，这种和SARS相近的病毒其实还是存在的。
"Although SARS has not made a comeback over the years, the SARS-like virus does exist in nature.
如果我们人类不提高警惕，那么下一次的病毒感染，可能是直接感染，也有可能会通过其他动物感染人类，这种可能性是完全存在的。
If we humans do not be vigilant, then the possibility that the next virus infection, either direct or through other animals, may exist.
”2018年，石正丽在武汉做演讲时说出了自己的担忧。
In a 2018 speech in Wuhan, Shi Zhengli voiced her concerns.
抗击“非典”已经取得胜利，谈到这场17年前的“战争”，人们依旧心有余悸，但“远离野味”最终还是被社会心理慢慢抹去。
The battle against SARS has been won, and the "war" of 17 years ago continues to haunt people, but "staying away from game" has been slowly erased by social psychology.
另一个让石正丽没想到的是“下一次”来得如此之快。
Another thing Shi Zhengli didn't expect was that the "next time" would come so quickly.
2019年年底，武汉新型肺炎爆发，这也是21世纪以来冠状病毒家族第三次肆虐人间世界。
At the end of 2019, Wuhan's new pneumonia broke out, the third time since the 21st century that a coronavirus family has ravaged the world.
以某野生动物作为开端，在华南海鲜市场完成由动物到人类的中转，新型冠状病毒与17年前的SARS爆发过程有着诸多相似。
Starting with a wild animal, the new coronavirus has much in common with the SARS outbreak 17 years ago.
美国生物学家贾德·戴蒙德在《枪炮，病菌与钢铁》一书中感慨：“整个近代史上的人类杀手是天花，流行性感冒，肺结核、疟疾，瘟疫，麻疹和霍乱。
"The human killers throughout recent history have been smallpox, influenza, tuberculosis, malaria, plague, measles and cholera," says American biologist Judd Diamond in The Guns, Germs, and Steel.
他们都是从动物的疾病演化而来的传染病，虽然奇怪的是，引起我们人类流行疾病的大多数病菌如今几乎只局限在人类中流行。
They are all infectious diseases that have evolved from animal diseases, although, oddly enough, most of the pathogens that cause human epidemics are now almost exclusively confined to humans.
”当疾病爆发导致一个人群、社区或地区中有反常的高比例患病者时，这一疾病就称为流行病。
The disease is known as an epidemic when it results in an abnormally high proportion of patients in a population, community or region.
世界卫生组织（WHO）颁布的《国际卫生条例》，就是为了世界各国免受传染病的侵害。
The International Health Regulations promulgated by the World Health Organization (WHO) are designed to protect the world from infectious diseases.
在日益全球化的今天，共同对抗病毒则是全人类义不容辞的责任。
In today's increasingly globalized, the common anti-virus is the responsibility of all mankind.
相比较而言，2012年爆发于沙特阿拉伯的“中东呼吸综合征（MERS）”则是一种年轻的疾病，人们对其所知更是少之又少。
By contrast, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which broke out in Saudi Arabia in 2012, is a young disease that is little known.
2012年9月，MERS被发现于一位曾去过沙特阿拉伯的卡塔尔病患身上，他被施以呼吸道疾病的治疗，但疾病最后引起肾衰竭，入院后11天后死亡，而该疾病的诱因也是一种新型的冠状病毒。
In September 2012, MERS was found on a Qatari patient who had been to Saudi Arabia and who had been treated for respiratory disease that eventually led to kidney failure and died 11 days after admission, a new coronavirus.
三年后，韩国首尔出现首例境外移入病例。
Three years later, Seoul, South Korea, had its first case of emigration.
此后不到1个月的时间，韩国的感染患者已过百例，依照病史，少数被感染者和患者处于同一病房，五分钟到数小时即受到感染。
Less than a month later, there were more than 100 cases of infection in South Korea, and according to medical history, a small number of infected people and patients were in the same ward and became infected within five minutes to several hours.
MERS在韩国表现出的高度传播力引起世卫的注意，而彼时患者已分布在25个国家，1142例中东呼吸综合征病例被报告，死亡人数为465人，死亡率达40.7%。
The high level of transmission demonstrated by MERS in South Korea was brought to the attention of WHO, at a time when patients were in 25 countries and 1,142 cases of respiratory syndrome in the Middle East were reported, with 465 deaths, or a mortality rate of 40.7 per cent.
人们对MERS病毒的溯源也在进行，最终在一种非洲蝙蝠体内发现了抗体，间接传染源则是北非单峰驼。
Traceability to the source of the MERS virus is also ongoing, culminating in the discovery of antibodies in an African bat and the indirect source of infection being the North African Bactrian Camel.
按照推论，随着北非到中东的贸易，单峰驼商队把病毒又带到了中东地区，通过鼻子分泌物感染更多的骆驼，也感染了更多的人。
By inference, as North Africa traded with the Middle East, the Bactrian caravan brought the virus back to the Middle East, infecting more camels and infecting more people through nosesecretions.
而针对MERS，人类目前尚没有疫苗或者特异治疗办法。
For MERS, there is currently no vaccine or specific treatment.
从埃博拉到SARS，从MERS到武汉肺炎，这些大规模传染病最初的传染源似乎都指向野生动物，而这些并不只是巧合。
From Ebola to SARS, from MERS to Wuhan pneumonia, it is no coincidence that the original source of infection for these large-scale infectious diseases seems to have been wild animals.
广为人知的艾滋病，在漫长的研究后被发现病毒来自黑猩猩和白顶白眉猴，就连所有人都得过的流感也是来自鸟类。
Known as AIDS, the virus was found to have originated from chimps and white-capped macaques after a long study, and even the flu everyone has had comes from birds.
未来，倘若再有某种病毒从野生动物身上转移到人类身体内，很可能还会引发大规模疫情，而我们依旧对致病病毒一无所知。
In the future, if another virus were to be moved from wild animals to humans, it would probably cause a massive outbreak, and we would still know nothing about the disease-causing virus.
从病毒到细菌21亿年前，细胞、病毒、细菌三者之间便开始产生紧密联系，也成为人类传染病学最关注的三个关键词。
From viruses to bacteria 2.1 billion years ago, cells, viruses, bacteria have been closely linked, and has become the most important human infectious disease of the three keywords.
伴随着长期的进化，部分病毒不再单独行动，他们利用细菌，产生了“搭台唱戏”的致命组合。
With long-term evolution, some viruses no longer act alone, using bacteria to create a deadly combination of "stage singing."
1918年，第一次世界大战爆发的第五年，欧洲四分五裂。
In 1918, the fifth year of World War I, Europe was divided.
与此同时，一种看不见的病毒正开始在世界范围内扩散。
Meanwhile, an invisible virus is beginning to spread around the world.
这一病毒最先在西班牙公布，而这次疫情也被称为“西班牙流感”。
The virus was first reported in Spain, and the outbreak is also known as "Spanish flu."
当时没有研制相关疫苗的技术，抗生素也都还未被发现，病情呈现失控状态。
At the time, there was no technology to develop a vaccine, and antibiotics had not yet been discovered, leaving the disease out of control.
据相关研究资料统计，这场堪称人类历史上最致命的流感病毒，于1918年席卷全球，共造成约5000万人死亡，却在18个月后神秘地消失了。
The deadliest influenza virus in human history, which killed about 50 million people in 1918, mysteriously disappeared 18 months later, according to research.
从1997开始，科学家们利用当年流感罹难者尸体获得“西班牙流感”全基因组序列。
Starting in 1997, scientists used the bodies of those killed by the flu to obtain a full genome sequence of the "Spanish flu."
2005年，利用反向遗传学系统，一名流感专家博士对病毒开展复活实验。
In 2005, using a reverse genetics system, an influenza expert carried out a resuscitation experiment on the virus.
就这样，一个已经绝迹的病毒通过科学家的努力和智慧被赋予了新的生命，在高度防护的实验室里，“潘多拉魔盒”被打开。
In this way, a extinct virus was given new life through the efforts and wisdom of scientists, and in a highly protected laboratory, the Pandora's Box was opened.
经研究发现1918年流感病毒并不会直接致死，而是诱导免疫系统强烈应答并通过肺炎链球菌引起呼吸衰竭。
The 1918 flu virus was found not to kill people directly, but to induce a strong immune response and respiratory failure via Streptococcus pneumoniae.
年轻、健康的成年人免疫系统较强，通常更容易产生“细胞因子风暴”，这也解释了在1918年流感中为什么年轻健康的成年人死亡率更高。
Younger, healthier adults have stronger immune systems and are often more prone to "cytokine storms," which explains why young, healthy adults have higher death rates during the 1918 flu.
与“西班牙流感”病毒引发免疫系统过激反应相比，另一种病毒却采取了截然相反的路径。
In contrast to the "Spanish flu" virus, which triggers an overreaction of the immune system, the other virus takes the opposite route.
1981年6月5日，美国疾病预防控制中心接到报告：洛杉矶有4名患者因感染卡氏肺囊虫性肺炎死亡。
On June 5, 1981, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States received reports that four patients in Los Angeles had died from pneumoconiosis.
这是人们很少碰到的一种疾病，更奇怪的是，它突然在一种特殊的人群——男性同性恋者中出现。
It was a rare disease, and strangely, it suddenly appeared among a particular group of people, gay men.
仅仅一个月后，美国疾病预防控制中心又接到报告，发现26例卡波济肉瘤患者，患者无一例外，都是男同性恋者。
Just a month later, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States received reports of 26 cases of Kaposi sarcoma, all of them men who had sex with men.
这种发病率应该仅为三百万分之二的疾病在同性恋者中如此高频率的出现，同样显得相当反常。
It is also unusual that the incidence of the disease, which should be only two-thirds of three million, should be so high among homosexuals.
这种由免疫缺陷引发、通过血液传播的疾病，在没有更多合理的科学解释之前被命名为“男同性恋免疫缺陷症”。
The blood-borne disease, triggered by immune deficiency, was named Gay Immune Deficiency Disorder (Gay Immune Deficiency Disorder) without more rational scientific explanation.
几个月后，事态便出现反转。
After a few months, things turned around.
有人在静脉吸毒者中发现了相似病例，越来越多接受过输血治疗的血友病患者也被发现感染了这种疾病。
Similar cases have been found among intravenous drug users and an increasing number of hemophilia patients treated for blood transfusions have also been found to have contracted the disease.
美国疾病预防控制中心最终把这种疾病重新定名为“获得性免疫缺陷综合症”（AIDS），中文音译：艾滋病。
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention eventually renamed the disease Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS).
一颗艾滋病毒只有120纳米宽，共有九个基因，可以造出可怜巴巴的十五个蛋白。
An HIV is only 120 nanometres wide and has nine genes that make a pathetic set of 15 proteins.
但就是这种结构和遗传信息都单纯得一目了然的病毒，却能摧毁人体的免疫系统。
But even this simple virus of structure and genetic information can destroy the body's immune system.
正常情况下，微生物侵入人体时，首先会遭到人体免疫系统的抵抗。
Normally, when microorganisms invade the body, they are first resisted by the body's immune system.
免疫系统T淋巴细胞是人体免疫系统的重要组成部分，负责阻挡病毒进入免疫系统，但对于艾滋病病毒，它却无能为力。
Immune system T lymphocytes are an important part of the body's immune system, responsible for blocking the virus into the immune system, but it can do nothing about HIV.
艾滋病病毒在侵入免疫系统中的T细胞后，便将其变成傀儡工厂，不断生成新的艾滋病病毒。
When HIV invades T cells in the immune system, it turns them into puppet factories, constantly generating new HIV.
随着病毒的增加，人体免疫系统彻底败下阵来，各种微生物、寄生虫长驱直入。
With the increase of the virus, the human immune system completely defeated, a variety of micro-organisms, parasites into the drive.
于是，严重的机会性感染和肿瘤随之发生，艾滋病人最终也会因严重的感染或肿瘤死亡。
As a result, serious opportunistic infections and tumours ensue, and people with AIDS eventually die from serious infections or tumours.
如今三十年过去了，人类依旧没有有效的预防或者治疗手段出现，也正是在这30年的时间里，艾滋病已经吞噬了3000万人的生命。
Thirty years later, humanity still has no effective means of prevention or treatment, and it is in the past 30 years that AIDS has claimed 30 million lives.
而目前，全世界依旧有3790万名之巨的艾滋病病毒（HIV）感染者，并造成每年大约77万人死亡。
There are still 37.9 million HIV-infected people in the world, and about 770,000 people die each year.
病毒星球美国耶鲁大学学者卡尔·齐默曾写过一本书：《病毒星球》，在书中卡尔这样描写病毒：我们生活的历史，其实就是一部病毒史。
The Virus Planet Karl Zimmer, a Yale University scholar in the United States, wrote The Planet of Viruses, in which Karl describes viruses: The history of our lives is actually a history of viruses.
地球上的病毒数量也多到“令人发指”。
The number of viruses on Earth is also horrendous.
比如说，当你跳进海水里畅快游泳的时候，你其实是在一大堆病毒里钻来钻去。
For example, when you dive into the water and swim, you're actually drilling through a whole bunch of viruses.
科学家曾计算，在每升海水当中，含有1000亿个病毒颗粒；在地球的所有海洋里，大约存在着10的31次幂个病毒颗粒。
Scientists have calculated that there are 100 billion viral particles per liter of seawater; about 10 power virus particles exist in about 10 of all oceans on Earth.
这个数量是海里面所有鱼、虾、蟹及其他海洋生物数量加到一起的15倍；这些病毒的总重量相当于7500万头蓝鲸；如果把这些病毒挨个儿排成一排，它们的长度会是4200万光年，这比整个银河系还要大得多。
That's 15 times the amount of fish, shrimp, crabs and other marine life in the ocean combined; the viruses weigh 75 million blue whales; if the viruses were lined up one by one, they would be 42 million light-years long, much larger than the entire galaxy.
病毒这个东西，本身却小到不可思议。
The virus itself is incredibly small.
如果把每个食盐颗粒想象成一个小立方体。
Imagine each salt particle as a small cube.
就在这个小立方体的每条边缘上，可以肩并肩排下100个细菌；但是如果换成了病毒，竟然可以排下1000个之多。
On each edge of the cube, 100 bacteria could be lined up side by side; but if the virus were changed, it could row up to 1,000.
也正是因为体积微小的原因，它比细胞与细菌的发现都晚了200多年。
Because of its small size, it is more than 200 years later than the discovery of cells and bacteria.
细菌也是无处不在，往往以单细胞形态独立存活, 也可以生活在在其他生物体内。
Bacteria, too, are ubiquitous, often surviving in single-celled form or in other organisms.
细菌并非都是有害的,如果细菌的腐蚀，地球上恐怕早已“尸横遍野”，如果肠道内没有益生菌，消化也难以进行。
Bacteria are not all harmful. If bacteria corrode, the earth will probably already be "dead," and digestion will be difficult without probiotic bacteria in the intestine.
病毒和细菌一样都是微生物，却只能在生物体内繁殖。
Viruses, like bacteria, are microbes, but can only reproduce in living things.
一旦病毒进入人体，便会把矛头对准健康细胞, 诱骗它们罢工，转而制造更多的病毒。
Once the virus enters the body, it will target healthy cells, tempting them to strike and create more viruses.
虽然它们的名字叫做“病毒”，但它们的作用远不止让人得病这么简单。
Although their name is "virus," they do much more than make people sick.
有着“细菌病毒”之称的噬菌体会入侵并杀死特定的细菌，人体内所含的逆转录病毒在遗传过程也发挥了重要作用。
Bacteriophages, known as bacterial viruses, invade and kill specific bacteria, and the body contains retroviruses that play an important role in genetic processes.
相较于病毒，细菌所引起的疾病在现在更易治疗。
Bacterial diseases are now easier to treat than viruses.
但是在发现抗生素之前，人类没有任何针对细菌感染的有效治疗方法。
But until antibiotics were discovered, humans did not have any effective treatment for bacterial infections.
医院里挤满了因割伤或划伤而患上败血症的患者，医生们完全束手无策，只能观察，希望患者能自己熬过去。
Hospitals are packed with patients suffering from septicaemia caused by cuts or scratches, and doctors are left with no choice but to observe and hope that patients will survive on their own.
事实上，细菌也曾在人类之间造成了相互传染的重大瘟疫。
Bacteria, in fact, have caused major plagues of mutual transmission among humans.
1346年，信奉钢刀和骏马的蒙古军队将铁骑开进黑海港口的一个城市。
In 1346, Mongol troops, armed with steel knives and steeds, rode iron into a city in the Black Sea port.
攻城不下之际，恼羞成怒的成吉思汗下令将染有鼠疫的尸体用抛石机拋入城内。
As the siege continued, the indignant Genghis Khan ordered the bodies contaminated with the plague to be stoned into the city.
城内的人并不了解鼠疫，对抛进的尸体置之不理。
People in the city were unaware of the plague and ignored the bodies thrown in.
尸体腐烂后，一场恐怖的瘟疫随之席卷而来。
A terrible plague swept over the body after it had rotted away.
人们竭尽全力逃避死亡，他们向上帝祈祷，吃美味的肉，喝好酒...医生尝试了各种方法，从通便到放血，到烟熏，到烧灼淋巴结，再到给他们涂上干蟾蜍液，最终都无济于事。
People do their best to avoid death, they pray to God, they eat delicious meat, they drink good wine... Doctors have tried everything from stools to bloodletting, to fumigation, to burning lymph nodes, to applying dry toad fluid to them, to no avail.
“鸟嘴医生”便是来自黑死病肆虐时期的医师。
Doctor Bird's Beak was a physician from the time the Black Death raged.
他们会戴着具有防传染功能的鸟喙状面具来治疗病患，这些瘟疫医师往往没受过多少医学训练，也缺乏临床诊断能力，但是由于欧洲人手奇缺，这些医生又都成为各个城镇相当珍贵的资产。
They are treated with beak-like masks that protect them from infection, often with little medical training and little clinical diagnostic capability, but because of the scarcity of European hands, these doctors are valuable assets in towns and cities.
他们往往身着长袍，使用一种木制的拐杖碰触病人治病。
They often wear robes and use wooden crutches to touch patients for treatment.
也用于鞭打病人以赦免他们的罪，因为当时的人们相信罹患黑死病是不受上帝庇祐的恶人，而唯有透过鞭笞，病人才能从上天的惩罚中获得救赎。
It was also used to flogging patients to absolve them of their sins, because people believed that the Black Death was a wicked man who was not shielded by God, and only through the lash of the whip could the patient be redeemed from the punishment of God.
没过多久，黑死病的现象在欧洲已经比比皆是，送葬的钟声就不停地为新的死者哀鸣。
It was not long before the Black Death was rampant in Europe, and the bells that carried it continued to wail for the new dead.
丹麦的年鉴第一次用“黑色的”来描述这一事件，不只是因为患者晚期的皮肤会因皮下出血变黑，更确切的是指此事件给人带来灰暗可怕的黑色恐怖阴霾。
For the first time, the Danish yearbook describes the event as "black," not only because the patient's late skin is blackened by subcutaneous bleeding, but also because the event brings a dark, dark haze of horror.
“行人在街上走着走着突然倒地而亡；待在家里的人孤独地死去，在尸臭被人闻到前，无人知晓；每天、每小时大批尸体被运到城外；奶牛在城里的大街上乱逛，却见不到人的踪影……”薄伽丘笔下的佛罗伦萨已然变成了一座人间地狱。
"Pedestrians are walking down the street and suddenly fall dead; those who stay at home die alone and no one knows until the stench is smelled; corpses are transported out of town in droves every day and hour; cows roam the streets of the city without being seen..."
黑死病能在中世纪欧洲爆发很大程度上因为贫穷和肮脏，城市里垃圾任意的丢弃，饮用水也被生活污水污染。
The Black Death could erupt in medieval Europe largely because of poverty and squalor, the indiscriminate dumping of garbage in cities, and the contamination of drinking water by domestic sewage.
这一切随着工业革命的到来而开始改变，人们得富有，城市公共卫生系统也被逐渐完善，黑死病在盛行百年后最终结束了。
All this changed with the advent of the industrial revolution, people had to be rich, the urban public health system was gradually perfected, and the Black Death finally ended after a century of prevalence.
据统计，黑死病大概在全世界杀死了2500万人，也深刻地改变了人类历史。
Statistics show that the Black Death killed 25 million people around the world and profoundly changed human history.
由于疫情对英格兰的摧残尤其厉害，因为英格兰人口更少，被黑死病夺走了100万人，当时英格兰总人口只有400多万，历史上著名的英法百年战争也由于这场瘟疫被迫停顿。
England has been particularly hard hit by the epidemic because it has a smaller population, claiming a million people from the Black Death, when it had a population of more than 4 million, and the historic Hundred Years' War between Britain and France was brought to a halt by the plague.
当人类发现第一种抗生素，距离黑死病爆发已经过了500多年，由此往后治疗细菌感染便有了行之有效最有效的办法。
When humans discovered the first antibiotic, more than 500 years after the outbreak of the Black Death, there was a proven and most effective way to treat bacterial infections.
与此同时，人类也为干涉自然规律的行为付出代价：部分细菌开始产生抗药性并且遗传给后代，最终演变为“超级细菌”。
At the same time, humans pay for interference with the laws of nature: some bacteria begin to develop resistance and pass it on to future generations, eventually becoming "superbugs."
据疾病控制和预防中心CDC最新报告称，具有耐药性的“超级细菌”每年感染280万人，并造成35000多人死亡，这凸显了公共卫生领域的一个新的巨大威胁，CDC称其为“后抗生素时代”。
According to a recent report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's CDC, drug-resistant "super-bacteria" infect 2.8 million people a year and kill more than 35,000, highlighting a major new threat to public health, which the CDC calls the "post-antibiotic era."
通过长期与细菌和病毒的抗争，人类通过自身进化构建了免疫系统的三道防线：皮肤和黏膜及其分泌物构成第一道防线；体液中的杀菌物质和吞噬细胞构成第二道防线；由免疫器官（扁桃体、淋巴结、胸腺、骨髓、和脾等）和免疫细胞（淋巴细胞、单核/巨噬细胞、粒细胞、肥大细胞）借助血液循环和淋巴循环构成的第三道防线。
By fighting bacteria and viruses for a long time, humans evolved to form the first line of defense: the skin and mucous membranes and their secretions constitute the first line of defense; the bactericidal substances and phagocytes in bodily fluids constitute the second line of defense; and immune cells (lymphocytes, mononuclear / macrophages, granulocytes, mast cells) constitute the third line of defense through blood circulation and lymphatic circulation.
也正是这三道防线帮助人类抵御了绝大多数的病毒和细菌入侵，免疫系统从婴儿出生开始也在“记住”这些微生物，在抗击部分病源过程中人体会产生抗体并终生免疫。
It is these three lines of defense that help protect humans from most viruses and bacteria, which the immune system "remembers" from birth, producing antibodies and lifelong immunity in the fight against parts of the disease.
疫苗的工作原理则是通过模仿细菌或者病毒侵入身体的过程，从而激活我们的免疫系统，其成分通常是不具感染能力的病毒。
The vaccine works by mimicking the process by which bacteria or viruses invade the body, thereby activating our immune system, which is usually composed of viruses that are not infectious.
人类如何抗毒？比尔盖茨曾经在一次演讲中公开说，如果有什么东西在未来几十年里可以杀掉上千万人，最大可能是个某个高度传染的病毒，因为我们在防止疫情的系统上却投资很少，我们还没有准备好预防一场大疫情的发生。
Bill Gates once said in a speech that if something could kill tens of millions of people in the next few decades, perhaps a highly contagious virus, because we have invested very little in systems to prevent it, and we are not ready to prevent a pandemic.
面对新型病毒导致的传染病，人们的第一直觉是寄希望于特效药和疫苗的研制。
In the face of new viruses causing infectious diseases, people's first instinct is to put their hopes in the development of specific drugs and vaccines.
然而遗憾的是，针对一种全新病毒特效药和疫苗在短时间内很难发挥较大的作用。
Unfortunately, however, it is difficult to play a large role in the short term for a new virus-specific drug and vaccine.
且不论特效药和疫苗能否在人体发挥作用，单就药物开发和疫苗研制从启动研究到真正量产也需要相当漫长的等待。
Regardless of whether specific drugs and vaccines work in the human body, it takes a long time to move from start-up research to real mass production of drugs and vaccines alone.
2002年底，广东爆发SARS，七个月后便被逐渐控制。
SARS broke out in Guangdong in late 2002 and was gradually brought under control seven months later.
而SARS病毒的疫苗则是从2004年春季启动，2006年才正式完成。
The SARS vaccine, which started in spring 2004, was not officially completed until 2006.
彼时的SARS已经销声匿迹。
SARS had disappeared at that time.
从1987年开始，美国启动历史上第一个艾滋病疫苗的临床试验。
Beginning in 1987, the United States began clinical trials for the first AIDS vaccine in history.
但在此之后的30年中，全世界开发的艾滋病疫苗达40多种，却没有一种值得上市的疫苗。
But in the 30 years since then, more than 40 AIDS vaccines have been developed worldwide, but none worth marketing.
药物开发亦是如此，即便是应用到实际治疗过程往往只能发挥辅助作用。
The same is true of drug development, even when applied to actual treatment processes, which often play only a supporting role.
对于各类新型病毒，至今也没有找到特效药物，治疗过程只能通过辅助呼吸、抗感染、补充体液等方法维持患者的生存，然后等待患者自身的免疫系统消灭入侵的病毒，如今的武汉肺炎的治疗过程亦是如此。
So far, no specific drugs have been found for the various types of new viruses, and the treatment process can only sustain the patient's survival by means of assisted respiration, anti-infection, and rehydration, and then wait for the patient's own immune system to destroy the invading virus, as is now the case with Wuhan Pneumonia.
而面对此类突然爆发的传染病，古老但异常有效的办法就是隔离。
In the face of such sudden outbreaks of infectious disease, the old but extraordinarily effective way is to isolate.
从1374年威尼斯封城对抗黑死病，到1910年伍连德切断铁路对抗东北大鼠疫，再到这次武汉封城对抗新冠病毒肺炎，隔离都发挥了至关重要的作用。
From 1374, when Venice was closed to the Black Death, to 1910, when Wulende cut off the railroad against the Northeast plague, to Wuhan, where the city fought against the New Crown virus pneumonia, isolation played a crucial role.
隔离的核心有三条：一是找到和管理传染源。
The core of isolation is threefold: one is to find and manage the source of infection.
比如一旦发现病毒具有人传人的特性，将患病或疑似患病者快速识别并隔离治疗便能很快控制疫情。
For example, once the virus is found to have human-to-human characteristics, rapid identification and isolation of those who are or are suspected to be infected can quickly control the outbreak.
二是切断传播途径。
Second, cut off the transmission route.
SARS和武汉肺炎均依靠飞沫传播，避免人群的大规模的聚集和长距离的移动则有助于切断传播途径。
Both SARS and Wuhan pneumonia rely on droplet transmission, and avoiding large-scale crowding and long-distance movement can help to cut off transmission routes.
三是保护易感人群。
Third, protect vulnerable groups.
在武汉肺炎爆发初期，年长者因为自身免疫能力下降成为易感人群，受重视程度相较而言更高。
In the early stage of Wuhan Pneumonia outbreak, the elderly due to the decline in their immune capacity into the vulnerable population, the importance of a higher degree.
看完以上三点，我们也就能够理解国家为何在抗击新冠状病毒时果断采取医学隔离，封锁交通等措施并号召全员戴口罩。
After reading the above three points, we can understand why the country has acted decisively to isolate patients from the new coronavirus, block traffic, and call on all personnel to wear face masks.
传染病得以爆发的根本在于其传染性，曾参与抗击非典的台湾病毒专家苏益仁指出这些病毒也都遵循一个共通的法则：致死率越高传染率越低，例如埃博拉病毒感染后致死率高达 90%，但传染可能性极低；SARS病毒是在患者发病后具有很强的传染性，但致死率较低。
The outbreak of infectious diseases is rooted in their infectivity, and Taiwan virus expert Su Yiren, a former SARS expert, points out that the viruses follow a common rule: the higher the death rate, the lower the transmission rate, for example, 90% after Ebola virus infection, with a very low probability of transmission; and the SARS virus is highly contagious but has a low mortality rate.
病毒的传播高度依赖个体间的接触，如果一个患上传染病的人不能传播给超过一个人的话，经过日积月累这种疾病就会自行消失。
The spread of the virus is highly dependent on personal contact, and if a person suffering from an infectious disease is unable to transmit it to more than one person, the disease disappears over time.
为了衡量病毒的传播力，人们发明了一个相对简便的定量指标，叫基本传染数（R0），代表在没有外力干预的条件下，一个感染者平均而言能够传染给几个人。
In order to measure the spread of the virus, a relatively simple quantitative indicator has been developed, called Basic Infection Number (R0), which means that an infected person, on average, can infect several people without outside intervention.
我们常见的麻疹RO在12-18之间，天花的传播率在3.5-7之间，流感则普遍在2-4之间，17年前的SARS则在2-5之间。
Our common measles RO is between 12 and 18, smallpox is between 3.5 and 7, influenza is 2-4, and SARS was 2-5 17 years ago.
近日，发表在《新英格兰医学杂志》的《新型冠状病毒感染肺炎在中国武汉的初期传播动力学》一文，根据最早425例确诊病例数据测算出武汉肺炎的RO值小于2.2。
Recently, the New England Journal of Medicine published in the New England Journal of Medicine, "New Coronavirus Infection Pneumonia in Wuhan, China," published in the New England Journal of Medicine, estimated the RO value of Wuhan pneumonia to be less than 2.2, based on the earliest 425 confirmed cases.
误解与谣言随着武汉肺炎的持续扩散，疫情的发展也成为当下全民关注的话题，人们时刻关注着权威媒体的报道，也接收到了一些堪称“谣言”的小道消息。
Misunderstandings and Rumors With the continuous spread of pneumonia in Wuhan, the spread of the epidemic has also become a topic of public concern, people have been watching the reports of the authoritative media, but also received some can be described as "rumors.
病毒传染，谣言传播，病毒伤肺，误区和谣言却在扰乱人心。
Virus infections, rumors spread, viruses injure lungs, myths and rumors are disturbing.
1月20日，一张截图在朋友圈广为流传，截图文字称：SARS期间全国几乎没有吸烟者因SARS而死亡。
January 20, a screenshot widely circulated in the circle of friends, screenshot said: SARS during the country almost no smokers died from SARS.
烟是纳米级的，烟油子覆盖了肺细胞表面，相当给每个细胞带了一个人纳米级的口罩，比微米级K90口罩还细微和致密，可以阻挡病毒的附着和进入，断了根本。
Smoke is nanometer-sized, and the soot covers the surface of lung cells, giving each cell a human nanometer-sized mask that is finer and denser than a micron-scale K90 mask, blocking the virus's attachment and entry, cutting off its roots.
随后便有业内专家站出来指正这一观点。
Industry experts have since come forward to point this out.
虽然非吸烟者患SARS的比例有一点点增加，但是统计上没有明显的区别，吸烟不是一个抵御病毒的办法。
Although there has been a slight increase in the incidence of SARS among non-smokers, there is no statistically significant difference and smoking is not a protection against the virus.
恰恰相反，吸烟往往会导致慢性气管炎、慢性支气管炎、慢性阻塞性肺疾病，反而会给病毒带来更多的感染机会。
On the contrary, smoking tends to cause chronic bronchitis, chronic bronchitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which increase the chance of infection.
1月25日，一段聊天记录开始在微信群广为流传，主讲人从理工男的角度讲解了病毒、细菌与癌症的原理，并宣称为了“免得大家惊慌”。
On January 25, a chat began to circulate widely among the microcosm, with speakers explaining the principles of viruses, bacteria and cancer from the perspective of a polytechnic man and claiming to "save people from panic."
随后，华润JCI医院管理研究院院长罗念慈则对记录中的部分误导信息进行了纠正。
Subsequently, the director of China Resources JCI Hospital Management Institute Luo Nian Tzu corrected some of the misinformation in the records.
“理工男”提到：目前只有一些超级细菌，人类还没有办法，但也可以通过各种抗生素同时上的方法来治疗，只要细菌的感染还没有导致器官大规模坏死，就基本不会死人的。
There are only a few superbugs that humans can't do, but they can be treated simultaneously with antibiotics, and so long as the infection doesn't lead to massive necrosis of the organs, they won't kill, the SET said.
罗念慈却表示：关于细菌，目前的问题是大量耐药的超级细菌如MRSA，VRE等每年造成数十万人死亡，近20年，人类研发下一代抗生素几乎全部失败，因此估计到2050年，每年1000万人因超级细菌而死亡。
With regard to bacteria, the problem is that resistant superbugs like MRSA and VRE kill hundreds of thousands of people each year. In the last 20 years, humans have almost completely failed to develop the next generation of antibiotics, so it is estimated that by 2050, 10 million people will die each year from superbugs.
因此，细菌的威胁是实实在在的人类生命的严重威胁。
The threat of bacteria is therefore a real and serious threat to human life.
针对“理工男”提出的：“一旦离开宿主的身体，（病毒）几分钟内甚至几秒钟内就会死亡”，罗念慈也有不同的看法，他表示：“病毒离开介质后几秒钟死亡的说法，更是严重误导，就说流感病毒，在电梯按钮，门把手等干燥地方可以生存24小时以上，潮湿地方时间更长，这就是为何人们需要戴口罩，勤洗手的原因。
"Once off the body of the host, the virus can die within minutes or even seconds," Royalty said, taking a different view. "The virus can live for more than 24 hours in dry places such as elevator buttons and doorknobs, and in humid places, which is why people need to wear masks and wash their hands frequently.
70%的流感病毒是，病人咳嗽喷嚏，飞沫把病毒带到物理空间后，健康人手接触了病毒，再接触自己的眼鼻口粘膜处，造成病毒侵入感染。
Seventy percent of influenza viruses are caused by coughing and sneezing. When droplets bring the virus into physical space, health workers come into contact with the virus and then come into contact with the mucous membranes of their eyes, nose and mouth, causing a viral infection.
”事实上，病毒是否是有机生命体至今仍在探讨，而它和细胞的结构也有着很大差别。
In fact, the question of whether the virus is an organic organism is still under discussion, and its structure is very different from that of cells.
细胞内含多种细胞器，病毒却只含有两到三个成分，结构概括起来便是：蛋白质衣壳包裹着遗传物质（DNA或RNA）。
Cells contain multiple organelles, but the virus has only two or three components. The structure is summarized as follows: the protein coat contains genetic material (DNA or RNA).
病毒的传播方式也是多种多样，动物病毒可以通过蚊虫叮咬而得以传播；流感病毒可由咳嗽和打喷嚏来传播；艾滋病毒和埃博拉则可以通过体液接触来传播；手足口病毒则可通过带有病毒的手、食物和水传播。
The virus also spreads in a variety of ways: animal viruses can be transmitted through mosquito bites; influenza viruses can be transmitted by coughing and sneezing; HIV and Ebola can be transmitted through body fluid contact; and HFMV can be transmitted through hands, food and water with viruses.
“理工男”还强调了栏杆不会传播病毒：“除非前面一个病毒携带者刚摸过这个栏杆，几秒内我们接触这个栏杆，并且接触的手上刚好有伤口，病毒才有万分之一分的机会，从这里侵入。
The SEM also stressed that the railing would not transmit the virus: "Unless the previous carrier had just touched the railing, within seconds we were in contact with the railing, and the hand had a cut, the virus had a one-in-a-million chance of getting through it."
”事实上非如此，早在2016年美国CDC实验室的几位科学家就做了严格的实验，发现流感病毒被证明在不锈钢表面上最长可以存活大约7天依然具备传染能力。
Indeed, as early as 2016, several scientists at the CDC Laboratory in the United States conducted rigorous experiments and found that influenza viruses had been shown to survive on stainless steel surfaces for up to seven days to remain infectious.
病毒也并非像“理工男”口中所说“一旦感染了病毒，目前是无药可医”。
The virus is not "once infected with the virus, there is no cure for it," as the Seiko says.
罗念慈在反驳的过程中提到了抗丙肝病毒药吉拉（利）德。
In his rebuttal, Luo refers to the anti-hepatitis C virus drug Gila (Rijraud).
2013年12月6日吉利德一代在美国上市，丙肝新药的研制也踏上了快车，2014年吉二代对丙肝的治愈率为95%，2017年5月16日在印度上市的Mylan吉三代的治愈率更是高达99%以上。
On December 6, 2013, the Gilad generation went on sale in the US, and the development of a new hepatitis C drug was accelerated, with 95% cure rate for Hepatitis C in 2014, and more than 99% for Mylan generation, which went public in India on May 16, 2017.
生活在充满病毒的星球已成事实，未来也必将长期依赖这个“病毒星球”，但是站在流血的人类抗毒史上我们也该有更深的思考。
Living on a virus-infested planet has become a reality, and the future will depend on it for a long time to come, but we need to think more about it in the history of bloody human drug resistance.
从40年前的中非埃博拉到如今的武汉肺炎，面对无常爆发的疾病，站在自然的角度来说，这些疾病的发生往往也是因为我们打破了某种平衡。
From Ebola in Central Africa 40 years ago to pneumonia in Wuhan today, in the face of volatile outbreaks of disease, these diseases often occur in a natural sense because we upset a certain balance.
有一本名叫《共病时代》的书，讲述了动物和人之间“共享”疾病的故事。
There is a book called The Age of Communism, which tells the story of "shared" disease between animals and people.
作者提到：“我们与动物的关系历史悠久且深刻，医生和患者都要让自己的思考跨越病床这个界限，延伸到农家院、丛林、海洋和天空。
"Our relationship with animals has a long and deep history, and doctors and patients alike have to think beyond hospital beds to farmhouses, jungles, oceans and the sky," the authors note.
”或许从今天看来，这些病毒为何能够“掉落人间”不仅是医生和患者需要思考的问题，更是所有人应有的反思。
Perhaps today, why these viruses "fall to earth" is not just a matter for doctors and patients to think about, but for everyone.
如果没有，我们还会很快被第四种冠状病毒裹足不前。
If not, we will soon be held back by the fourth coronavirus.
