燃财经（ID:rancaijing）原创作者 | 金玙璠编辑 | 魏佳眼下原本是手机行业传统的销售旺季，全国的渠道商、零售商年前备足了货，摩拳擦掌，就等着开工冲一把业绩，但一场疫情打懵了所有人。
Flaming Finance (ID: Rancaijing) Originally the traditional sales season for the mobile phone industry, Wei Jia is now in full supply for retailers and retailers around the country, who are waiting to start doing a good job, but a pandemic has stunned everyone.
来自天风证券的报告显示，2020年春节期间，中国市场手机出货同比降低50%-60%，导致目前手机库存水位已经达到了5000-6000万部的高线。
According to a report from Tianfeng Securities, mobile phone sales in China fell by 50-60 per cent year-on-year during the 2020 Spring Festival, bringing the total to 50-60 million units.
手机行业从本质来说也是零售业，面对疫情，大大小小的手机品牌专卖店不得不集体关店暂避风险。
The mobile phone industry is also retail in nature, facing the epidemic, large and small handset brand stores have to collectively close shop to avoid risk.
以苹果为例，截至2月29日，苹果在中国大陆的42家门店中只有八成复店。
As of February 29, for example, only 80% of Apple's 42 stores in mainland China had reopened.
另一个影响手机销售的因素是物流。
Another factor affecting mobile phone sales is logistics.
数据显示，主要快递企业整体复工率约为66.7%。
Data show that the overall resumption rate of major express enterprises is about 66.7 per cent.
调研机构IDC预计，2020年一至二月的国内整体市场，将面临同比约40%的大幅下滑，而在三月内，如果疫情得到稳定控制，整体市场将会逐渐进入恢复期，但仍难以恢复至去年同期水平。
IDC, the research firm, predicts that the domestic market as a whole will face a sharp decline of about 40 per cent year-on-year in the first two months of 2020, and that the overall market will gradually enter a recovery period in March if the epidemic is stabilized, but will find it difficult to return to the same period last year.
整个第一季度，国内市场预计遭遇30%以上的同比下滑幅度。
The domestic market is expected to experience a decline of more than 30 per cent year on year throughout the first quarter.
这些变化的数字和背后造成的冲击，放在武汉这座城市都会被进一步放大。
The number of these changes and the impact behind them will be further magnified in Wuhan, the city.
1月24日，武汉“封城”后的第二天，武汉小米之家发布公告，特别提到，将暂停武汉地区的大家电配送和安装服务，武汉地区的小件商品的配送服务仍在继续。
On January 24, Wuhan, the day after the "closure" of the city, Wuhan millet home issued a notice, specifically mentioned that Wuhan will suspend the distribution and installation of electricity services, Wuhan region of small goods distribution services continue.
然而小米之家湖北地区负责人告诉燃财经，由于湖北情况特殊，目前武汉地区无法进行同城配送，且其他手机品牌也是类似的情况。
However, the head of the Hubei area of Xiaomi's family told Flaming Finance that due to the special situation in Hubei, Wuhan could not carry out the same distribution at present, and other mobile phone brands are in a similar situation.
多位手机品牌武汉代理商也向燃财经证实了这一消息。
Wuhan agents of a number of mobile phone brands also confirmed the news to the fuel economy.
武汉仿佛被“冻”住了，但是企业要复工，学生要复课，在家办公的职场人，网上上课的学生党，需要手机。
Wuhan seems to be "frozen", but enterprises to return to work, students to resume classes, home-based workers, online classes of students, the need for mobile phones.
各地驰援武汉的医疗队员，手机每天经历消毒流程，非常容易损坏，他们有大量的维修、换机需求。
All over Wuhan medical team, mobile phones experienced daily sterilization procedures, very vulnerable to damage, they have a large number of maintenance, replacement needs.
多位武汉市民告诉燃财经，尽管快递正在复工，但现实是电商平台纷纷显示武汉地区不发货。
A number of Wuhan city residents told the fuel economy, although express delivery is returning to work, but the reality is that the commercial platform in Wuhan showed that the region does not deliver goods.
市场最末梢的店主成了最后的救命稻草，燃财经采访了其中四位，有从手机促销员白手起家的校园网红，有为一线调运上千万防护物资的志愿者，有面向湖北省地县市的经销商，还有上个世纪就入行的运营商代理。
Store owners at the bottom of the market were the last straw, with four of them being interviewed by the finance and finance industry, ranging from the self-made campus red of mobile-phone salesmen to volunteers carrying tens of millions of first-line protective gear to dealers in Hubei province's prefectural cities, as well as operators from the last century.
他们在武汉“封城”后继续营业，也最早感受到寒意，线下封店，现金流紧绷，年前的囤货都堆在仓库里，迟迟无法变现，只能苦等。
They continued to operate in Wuhan after the "closed city", also the first to feel the chill, online closure, tight cash flow, the years of hoarding in the warehouse, can not be converted into cash, can only wait for hardship.
手机再怎么发力也已经到瓶颈了要布局智能家居任爱华 湖北爱华通讯创始人我们是线下华为授权体验店，以零售为主，在武汉的20家直营店全部开在商场里。
How the mobile phone force has also been to the bottleneck to layout intelligent home Aihua Hubei Aihua Communications founder we are the authorized Huawei online experience shop, mainly retail, in Wuhan 20 direct shops opened in the mall.
公司一直以线下为主，但疫情突发，也庆幸自己从一年多以前就开始养开发者团队，烧了很多钱，开发了自己的商城，客户在这次疫情期间都是从线上商城下单。
The company has been mainly offline, but the outbreak, but also glad that since more than a year ago began to maintain a team of developers, burned a lot of money, developed their own mall, customers during the epidemic from the online shopping mall orders.
我们最终是想把ERP财务系统、开单系统、会员系统全部打通，现在在不断优化中，目前还没完全上线。
We finally want to ERP financial system, billing system, membership system all open, now in the process of continuous optimization, not yet fully online.
过去一年公司销售额6个多亿，如果没有疫情，我相信一个月至少能卖1万多台，而这一个月大概只走了一千台左右。
If it hadn't been for the epidemic, I believe we could have sold at least 10,000 units a month, compared with about a thousand this month.
真正感受到疫情来了，是“封城”前三天，我联系山东的朋友发10000只双国标KN95口罩到武汉，原本计划着给每位到店的顾客送只口罩。
Three days ago, I contacted a friend in Shandong province and sent 10,000 double-national KN95 masks to Wuhan. I had planned to send a mask to every customer who came to the store.
没想到武汉封城，物流出问题了，各路人马都开始找我买口罩，我得知武汉各个医院急缺医疗物资，当时决定全部捐给医院。
Wuhan did not expect the closure of the city, logistics out of the problem, all passers-by began to look for me to buy masks, I learned that Wuhan hospitals are in urgent need of medical supplies, then decided to donate all of them to hospitals.
陆陆续续还是有很多人找我，那怎么办，我就到处去买。
I continued to have a lot of people looking for me, then how to do, I went everywhere to buy.
从1月21日到现在，我们自掏腰包买了100多万的防护物资，外地的朋友爱心捐赠的也有上千万。
From January 21 to the present, we have bought more than a million protective materials out of our own pocket, and tens of millions have been donated by friends in the field.
任爱华在搬运84消毒水来源/ 受访者提供浙江台州的一个朋友说要捐一个亿，我告诉他，这里不缺钱，要捐就捐物资。
A friend in Taizhou, Zhejiang, said he would donate one billion dollars. I told him that there was no shortage of money and that donations were needed.
他凑齐了10万只口罩、10吨84消毒水、1万个护目镜，当时是2月初，没有人敢来武汉，他拿出5万，请人把物资搬上车，半夜出发开往武汉。
He assembled 100,000 face masks, 10 tons of disinfectant and 10,000 goggles. At the beginning of February, no one dared come to Wuhan.
临出发前，司机师傅的孩子死活不同意：“非要去武汉，就从我身上轧过去”，只能再把所有物资卸下车 。
Before the departure of the driver, the master's children refused to agree: "Must go to Wuhan, rolling over me", had to unload all the goods.
三天后，我又求助其他朋友，才把这批物资运送到了武汉。
Three days later, I turned to other friends for help before sending the goods to Wuhan.
我和我爱人组建了一支志愿者团队，很多武汉企业家加入，这个团队就是在各地筹集医疗物资，再送到武汉的医院和社区去。
My wife and I formed a volunteer team, joined by many Wuhan entrepreneurs, to collect medical supplies from all over the country and send them to hospitals and communities in Wuhan.
火神山、协和医院、同济医院、金银潭医院和各地的医疗队的工作人员，需要智慧大屏、平板电脑、手机、智能音响这些设备，只要我们有库存，都会第一时间送过去，方便医护人员接收数据。
The staff of Flamingo Hill, Concorde Hospital, Tongji Hospital, Gold and Silver Pool Hospital and medical teams from all over the country need equipment such as smart screens, tablets, mobile phones and smart stereos.
其中一部分是我们捐赠的，也有一些人支付了成本。
Some of that was donated by us, and some people paid for it.
很多人建议我多宣传在一线的经历，门店所在的商场也在联系我，说只要讲出来，多少库存都不成问题，我都没有答应。
A lot of people advised me to publicize my experience on the front line. The store also contacted me, saying that as long as I speak out, how much stock is no problem, I did not answer.
库存压力的确非常大，年前囤了5000万的库存，武汉人只能在家办公、在家上课，不能出去消费，我们就做社区团购和抖音直播，快递不能保证时效，小伙伴就送货上门。
The inventory pressure is really very big, five years ago, the inventory hoard 50 million years ago, Wuhan people can only work from home, home classes, can not go out to spend, we do community shopping and live shake live, express delivery can not guarantee the timeliness of delivery, small partners on the door.
为了清库存，我们这一个月持续特价甩卖，赠品也多，送N95防护口罩、防护服。
In order to clear the inventory, we continued this month special sales, gifts, N95 respirator, protective clothing.
团队里有些小伙伴就特别不理解，觉得“你又不赚钱，还让公司的人用生命冒险去送货”。
Some of the team's small partners are particularly confused, feeling that "you do not make money, but also let the life of the company to risk delivery."
外面的确很危险，我们团队有6个人这一个月一天都没有休息过，除了送防护物资，还要给客户送货，他们每个人在外奔波，我的心理压力都很大，但是我自己作为一个武汉人，真的想用这种方式为客户贡献一份力量。
It is really dangerous outside, our team of six people did not rest a day this month, in addition to the delivery of protective equipment, but also to deliver goods to customers, each of them traveling, I have great psychological pressure, but as a Wuhan, I really want to use this way to contribute to customers.
疫情当下，坦白说，担心的首先是生存，而不是生意，我身边发生的苦难太多了，不被感染就是万幸，根本没有太多精力考虑企业的问题，唯一想的就是疫情赶快结束，让我们能够回归正常的生活，至于公司，等疫情过去，重头再来都可以。
The epidemic, frankly speaking, is more about survival than business. There is too much suffering around me. Luckily, there is not much energy to think about business. The only thing to think about is that the epidemic is over and we can go back to normal life.
任爱华在搬运物资 来源 / 受访者提供今年是我入行的第21年，从1999年卖BP机开始，到小灵通、2G、3G、4G转5G，每个时代都经历了。
Ren Ai-hua in source of materials / interviewees This year is my 21st year in the line of business, from selling BPGs in 1999 to PHS, 2G, 3G, 4G to 5G, every generation has experienced it.
从2010年被朋友卷钱跑路以后，我就一心一意只做华为，当时有人说我是疯子，他们都做多品牌的时候，我就开始把华为引进武汉最高端的购物中心。
Since being run by friends in 2010, I have been focusing on Huawei, when some people said I was crazy, they do multi-brand, I began to Huawei into Wuhan's top shopping center.
品牌艰难起步的时候，你没有陪着，它风生水起的时候，你又想分羹，那是不可能的。
Brand hard to start, you did not accompany it, when it started, you want to share the spoonful, that is impossible.
这一路走来，我的经验是，看准一个品牌，做专做精，而且不能只做手机了，手机再怎么发力，也已经到瓶颈了，未来还是要布局智能家居，这是一个尚待开发的市场。
My experience along the way is, look at a brand, do fine, and can not just do mobile phones, mobile phone power, has also reached the bottleneck, or layout smart home, this is a yet to be developed market.
生意好的时候没时间收钱现在都有时间搞维修了杜敏 手机经销商我们门店在华中通讯广场开业14年了，以批发为主，主要面向湖北省地县市的经销商。
We now have time to repair our handset dealers.Our store has been open in Huazhong Communications Square for 14 years, mainly wholesale, mainly for dealers in Hubei Province.
走量主要以手机为主，其他的平板、笔记本也都卖，品牌以苹果和华为为主。
The main volume of mobile phones, other tablets, notebooks are also sold, the brand to Apple and Huawei-based.
OPPO、vivo的区域保护制度极其严格，对每个经销商都是一样的要求，现在市面上能看到的专卖店都是按照官方指导价销售。
OPPO, Vivo's regional protection system is extremely strict, every dealer is the same requirements, can now be seen in the market are sold in accordance with the official guided price.
卖华为是因为，这个品牌在湖北省内的货源比较好，虽然有区域保护限制，但是不影响我们卖到湖北省内。
Huawei sells Huawei because this brand has a better supply in Hubei province. Although there are regional protection restrictions, it does not affect our sales to Hubei Province.
苹果的产品在全国各地哪里都可以走，没有任何限制。
Apple's products are available anywhere in the country without any restrictions.
以前还会带一些小众的品牌，魅族、中兴、努比亚，后来十有八九亏钱，慢慢就不再进货了。
Before will also bring a few minority brand, companion, Zhongxing, Nubian, later on nine out of ten lose money, slowly no longer stock.
相对来说，手机行业价格透明，利润比较低，但是因为价格基数大，很容易被一些零售客户误解，增加了很多沟通成本。
The cellphone industry is relatively transparent and less profitable, but because of its large price base, it can easily be misunderstood by some retail customers, increasing communication costs.
我们对经销商，利润就控制得更薄了，流通就需要更快，进一批货平均两天内就得卖出去，不然就要亏钱。
We have thinner profit controls for distributors, faster circulation, and an average of two days for incoming shipments, or we lose money.
店里85%的生意是靠老客户，另外15%是陌生客户触店。
Eighty-five percent of the store's business is with regular customers and another 15 percent is with unfamiliar customers.
从2018年开始，陌生客户越来越少，生意一年比一年难做，到去年已经减产到原来的1/5了。
Starting in 2018, with fewer and fewer new customers, business is getting harder every year, and last year it was down by a fifth.
我下面的经销商的生意就更惨了，现在一半以上都转行了。
My underling dealer's business is even worse, and now more than half of them have changed their profession.
眼看着客户一天天在流失，只卖新机是生存不下去的，我从2018年开始卖二手手机，结果发现非常受欢迎，这个市场不像新机竞争那么激烈，而且有利润空间。
I started selling secondhand phones in 2018 and found it very popular. It wasn't as competitive as the new one and there was room for profit.
生意最好的那些年，卖HTC和苹果手机第4代到第6代，每天收钱都收不过来，现在有的是时间倒腾二手手机，还有时间接换电池、换屏幕的维修生意。
In the best years of business, HTC and Apple sold from generation 4 to generation 6, unable to collect money every day, and now there's time for used phones and time to switch batteries and screen-changing maintenance businesses.
图 /视觉中国武汉封城这一个月，我们这些同行只能待在家里发发朋友圈，告诉别人“我还有货”，“可以同城配送”。
Wuhan, China This month, our colleagues can only stay at home to send friends, tell others "I still have goods," "can be delivered with the city.
现在武汉大部分人都是比较理智的，能不买的东西肯定不买，非买不可的东西才考虑买，虽然有老客户找我拿货，现在一天也就卖6-8台手机。
Wuhan is now the majority of people are more rational, can not buy things must not buy, only consider buying, although there are old customers looking for my goods, now a day to sell 6-8 mobile phones.
下面地县市的经销商也求我发货，但货都封在店里拿不出来，而且物流不通，等我能给他们发货的时候，家里仅有的存货也早就卖完了。
Dealers in the county below also asked me to ship the goods, but they were sealed in the store and the logistics were not good. When I was able to deliver the goods to them, the family's only stock would have been sold out.
现在武汉市手机的价位比平时略高，一是能流通的都是年前的囤货，进价本身不便宜，二是特殊时期，大家都有困难，稍微多挣点，一些急用的客户是可以接受的。
The price of mobile phones in Wuhan is slightly higher than usual. First, it is the hoard of years ago, the purchase price itself is not cheap, and second, special times, we all have difficulties, a little more money, some urgent customers are acceptable.
因为武汉的学生都只能在线上课，而且大概率长期如此，家长认为手机对孩子眼睛不好，平板的需求就上来了，原来3000元的苹果iPad，现在价格涨到了3500元。
Because Wuhan students can only attend classes online, and the probability is long-term, parents think mobile phones are bad for their children's eyes, demand for tablets came up, and the original 3,000-yuan Apple iPad now costs 3,500 yuan.
不过手机行业和其他行业不同，武汉一旦全城解封，两三天以后，只要外省的货进来了，价格马上就回归正常了。
However, the mobile phone industry and other industries, once Wuhan unsealed, two or three days later, as long as the provincial goods came in, prices immediately returned to normal.
对于我们来说，谈挣钱是不可能的，只是勉强维持，而且生意是做一天少一天。
It is impossible for us to talk about making money, just to keep it afloat, and it is business to do one day less.
现在有生意，是因为电商平台不往武汉发货，他们只能找信任的同城商家拿货，等到电商平台正常发货了，大多数人会放弃我们。
Now there is business, because the electric business platform does not ship to Wuhan, they can only find the trust of the same city to get goods, until the electrical business platform normal delivery, most people will give up us.
再者，市场的店铺大概率不能开门营业，就算允许营业，可能只有手机维修的需求会在前几天井喷式的爆发，购机需求更是短暂。
Moreover, the market store probability is not open to business, even if allowed to operate, probably only the demand for mobile phone repair in the last few days will erupt, purchase demand is short-lived.
到时候，店里的库存终于能拿到了，客户也不在了。
When the time comes, the store inventory can finally get, the customer is not there.
现在只能不断接单把家里的存货变现小贝数码店店主封城以后，我应该是还在武汉街头活跃的人之一，不是在送货，就是在寄同城快递的路上。
Now that I have been ordered to liquidate my family's inventory, I should be one of the people still active on the streets of Wuhan, either delivering goods or sending express mail to the city.
因为疫情，现在增加了设备租赁的业务。
As a result of the epidemic, the equipment leasing business has now been increased.
最早是因为我的一个老客户，他是一线医护人员，手机每天被消毒，进水了，联系我要维修。
First because one of my old clients, he is the front-line medical personnel, the mobile phone is disinfected every day, into the water, contact me to repair.
我想不能因为手机影响医护人员的工作，就把店里的展示机免费给他用，我们约定，等疫情结束，他再找我修手机。
I don't think that because the mobile phone affects the work of the medical staff, the display machine in the store for free use, we agreed that when the epidemic is over, he will look me up to repair the mobile phone.
后来各地的医疗救援队驰援武汉，我想他们人生地不熟，手机坏了没有地方修，也买不到新的，我就免费租设备给他们用。
Later medical rescue teams from all over the world rushed to Wuhan, I think they are unfamiliar with life, mobile phone broken no place to repair, no place to buy new equipment, I rent free equipment for them to use.
我最早进入手机圈是因为HTC。
I first entered the cell phone ring because of HTC.
2011年，我来武汉上学，大一那年一边读书，一边做HTC校园代理。
In 2011, I came to Wuhan to study, freshman year, while doing HTC campus agent.
当时一部分动力是赚点零花钱，更多的也是为了让别人肯定自己，尤其是女孩子，于是就混迹在论坛、微博、QQ空间，宣传自己。
Part of the motivation was to earn some pocket money, and more to convince others, especially girls, so they wandered around forums, Weibo, QQ space, promoting themselves.
那年有部电影叫《失恋33天》，它最火的时候，我在校园店里策划了“免费贴膜33天”活动，还被媒体采访了，当时没当回事，几天后手机信息都爆炸了，原来我被媒体报道成了大学生自食其力的典型。
There was a movie called "33 Days of Lovelorn." At its height, I planned a "33 Days of Free Mastering" campaign at the campus store and was interviewed by the media.
找我买手机的人越来越多，我也从兼职岗位升级成了HTC智能顾问。
More and more people are turning to me for mobile phones, and I've been promoted from a part-time job to a HTC intelligent consultant.
现在想想，当年早早就做了线上线下联动营销，把自己先打造成了校园“小网红”，再谈生意。
Now think about it, that early in the year to do on-line linkage marketing, the first call to their own campus "small net red," then talk about business.
大三那年，听学长们说租房很辛苦，每次搬家都是一次血泪史，我就考虑在武汉买房，免得毕业以后再租。
Senior year, listening students said that rental housing is very hard, every time moving is a history of blood and tears, I will consider buying a house in Wuhan, so as not to rent after graduation.
偶然的一次，我和一个同行去看房，最后他没买，我买了那栋楼的最大户型。
By chance, I went to the house with a colleague, but he didn't buy it. I bought the biggest model of the building.
那年我20岁，拿着家里支持的20万和自己攒的钱，完成了一笔一百万的交易，当然，也走上了还房贷之路。
At the age of 20, I made a million-dollar deal with the support and savings of my family and, of course, made the mortgage payments.
我的手机生意从最开始租一节小柜台，到和别人合租管理一家店，最后开了自家风格的数码店，我才算真正意义上在武汉扎根。
From renting a small counter to renting a store and eventually opening my own digital store, I was able to take root in Wuhan.
也是那段时间，因为骑电动车给客户送货感冒了好多次，于是去奥迪店买了A6L，那是人生第一台车。
At the same time, I went to Audi's and bought the A6L, the first car in my life, because I delivered a cold to my customers by E-bike several times.
后来经常听小伙伴说起保时捷多牛，终于在去年圆了跑车梦。
Later I often heard about Porsche and Bull, and finally had a dream of a sports car last year.
虽然新鲜劲过去了，这车基本都待在车库里，不过也算犒劳自己这么多年的辛苦吧。
Although the freshness of the past, the car basically stay in the garage, but also reward themselves for so many years of hard work.
我从校园手机起家，客户以学生为主，后来很多老客户参加了工作，又把我推荐给公司，企业级客户越来越多，比如斗鱼和一些地产公司，我就顺势在写字楼里开了第三家连锁直营店。
I started with mobile phones on campus and my clients were students. Many regular customers joined me and recommended me to the company. More and more corporate customers, such as fish fighting and some real estate companies, I opened a third chain store in an office building.
想赚钱就要帮客户解决多样化的问题，采购年会产品，甚至酒水的需求我们都接。
To make money, we need to help our customers solve the problem of diversification, purchasing annual meeting products, even the demand for alcohol we are responding to.
现在个人客户的需求也是多样的，虽然手机是看家产品，不过笔记本电脑、台式机、相机，甚至无人机、戴森系列产品，只要和科技数码生活相关的产品，我们都卖。
The needs of individual customers are also diverse, and while cell phones are home-looking, we sell laptops, desktops, cameras, and even drones and Dyson lines of products that are relevant to the digital life of technology.
我2011年入行的时候，商场都是一铺难求，很多人涌进来。
When I started out in 2011, the mall was so full of people that I couldn't find it.
去年整个手机市场下滑得厉害，也不分淡季旺季了，月月都是淡季，同行有的倒闭，有的转行。
Last year, the overall mobile phone market fell sharply, regardless of the peak season, month and month are off season, some of the colleagues closed, some change their profession.
因为我9年前就注重线上营销，各个门店也都有专属的客户群体，业务范围也广，我们八九成的订单都是线上找过来的，去年整体稳中有升。
Because I focused on online marketing nine years ago, each store also has its own customer base, the scope of business is wide, we 90% of the orders are found online, last year the overall steady rise.
来源 / 受访者提供每年春节后的第一个月，是我们门店上半年最重要的一个月，学生开学，企业招新，往常都是大量采购新设备的需求等着我们，现在连想都不要想了。
www.51education.net) www.youtheme.cnwww.youtheme.cnwww.youtheme.cnwww.youtheme.cn The first month after Spring Festival is the most important month in the first half of our store.
最发愁的是，年前的囤货都放在店铺拿不出来，还要支付车贷、房贷，现金流快扛不住了。
Most worrying of all, the hoarding of goods in the store years ago can not be taken out, but also to pay the car loan, mortgage, cash flow can not be carried quickly.
我们做生意的，最重要的不一定是赚钱，而是让现金流流动起来，所以现在只能不断接单，抓紧把家里的存货变现，手里没货了就从本地同行手里调货，成本高些也没办法，必须维持经营。
The most important thing we do business with is not necessarily to make money, but to make cash flow, so now we have to keep orders to liquidate our inventory and transfer it from our local counterparts when we are out of stock.
我可能撑不到5G换机潮了疫情之后考虑转行侯福安 中国移动代理商我属于营业厅性质的代理商，在武汉的商铺都是临街的，从国包商、省包商手里拿货，主要依托于中国移动的补贴政策，比如充话费送手机、保底消费送手机等等。
I may not be able to support the 5 G change of tide after the epidemic Hou Fuan China mobile agent I belong to the nature of a business office agent, shops in Wuhan are street-facing, from the national contractors, provincial contractors, mainly relying on China Mobile subsidies, such as mobile phone charges, Baoding consumer mobile phones, and so on.
拿华为举例，如果华为某款机型入围到运营商库里，就可以参加这些活动。
Take Huawei as an example. If Huawei finalizes a model in the carrier's library, it can participate in these activities.
入行之初，那时候在上个世纪，手机行业刚刚兴起，感觉自己进入了一个千年一遇的好产业，每天都是坐在店里等顾客。
At the beginning of my career, in the last century, the mobile phone industry was just beginning to feel like a once-in-a-millennium industry, sitting in a store waiting for customers every day.
但是随着运营商的市场空间不断被压缩，曾经对用户的优惠政策从2017年开始慢慢没有了，尤其是电商平台的崛起，包括跟进的各大品牌陆续自建了线上商城，对我们这种没有价格优势的店铺的冲击是致命的，我们必须出门找业务了，比如到社区做优惠活动。
But as operators' market space continues to shrink, the preferential policies once offered to users will fade from 2017 onwards, especially with the rise of e-commerce platforms, including follow-up brands that have built their own on-line shopping malls.
其实我们门店已经很注重线上维护了，平时顾客来办业务、买手机，都会留存微信，平时也会维护。
In fact, our store has paid attention to online maintenance, usually customers to do business, buy mobile phones, will retain micro-letters, usually will also maintain.
从2019年开始，我明显感觉到这个行业已经十分难做了，销售每年都下滑30%-50%。
From 2019 onwards, it became clear to me that the industry was already struggling, with sales falling 30% to 50% a year.
图 / 视觉中国年前，我拿出70万压货，谁知道武汉突然封城，门店封锁，存货拿不出来，少部分人通过微信联系我买手机，但是物流送不到，只能同城人肉送。
2007-9-24 16: 19 [hide] 2007-9-19 19: 19 [hide] [/ color] [color = Red] [color = Red] [/ color] [color = Red] [color = Red] [color = Red] [color = Red] [color = Red] [color = Red] [color = Red]
去年这个时候一个月能出五六百台手机，封城以后，订单是个位数。
Five or six hundred cell phones were available this time last year, and orders were in the single digits after the city was shut down.
我个人认为，现在出趟门都是胆战心惊，即便疫情结束，武汉每个人内心都是有阴影的，大家还是觉得待在家里最安全，可能要到八九月份，出门消费的行为才会恢复，即便到了那时候，触店的人肯定是少之又少。
Personally, I think it's scary to go out now. Even if the epidemic is over and everyone in Wuhan has a dark heart, people still feel the safest way to stay at home. It may not be until August or September that spending will recover.
今年只有线上生意可做，但是绝大部分像我们这样的商家既没有价格优势，又没有线上推销的客户基础。
This year there is only online business to do, but most businesses like ours have neither a price advantage nor an online customer base.
我和几个同行对今年的市场判断都比较悲观，这次疫情会洗牌一大批中小规模的门店，反而只有夫妻店能存活下来。
Several of my peers and I were pessimistic about the market this year, which would shake up a large number of small and medium-sized stores, but only a couple of them would survive.
现在什么都做不了，只能等，我最近总盯着新闻，看有没有其他更好的路子，偶尔发朋友圈和老客户互动，但是效果和预期差得太远，如果有值得高兴的事，那就是房东主动打电话过来，要减免一些房租。
I've been staring at the news lately to see if there's a better way to interact with regular customers on occasion, but the results and expectations are far from perfect.
到今年，我从业20年了，经历过3G、4G换机潮，对5G的判断是，虽然国家支持，但是一年之内不可能有大规模的换机需求。
By this year, after 20 years in business and a 3G and 4G switchover, the 5 gigabyte rule is that while the state supports it, there won't be a large-scale change in demand in a year.
我可能也撑不到下一次换机潮了，疫情之后，考虑转行。
I may not be able to sustain the next change of tide, after the epidemic, consider a change of occupation.
