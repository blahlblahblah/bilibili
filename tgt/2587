复工，原来我想得太乐观蔷薇 | 整理孤云| 编辑口述：袁先生（浙江一纺织企业老板）2月17日我们工厂开始复工，到现在十多天时间。
Back to work, I thought too optimistically. & nbsp; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & #
我们到岗员工从开始的150多人，到现在300多人。
We arrived at the staff from the beginning of more than 150 people, to more than 300.
没批准复工，我睡不着；批准复工没员工，我也睡不着；现在复工，我更睡不着了。
I can't sleep without permission; I can't get back to work without employees, and I can't get back to work.
开始我担心员工回不来，现在我担心员工回来，没活让他们干。
At first I was worried that the employees wouldn't come back. Now I'm afraid they won't come back.
目前政府出台了很多助企复工复产政策，这是好事，也确实帮了企业一些忙。
At present, the government has put in place many policies to help enterprises return to work, which is a good thing and has really helped enterprises.
但是如果想要经济复苏，我认为最重要的还是要拉动消费，而拉动消费的助力器是银行。
But if the economy is to recover, I think the most important thing is to prop up consumption, which is being driven by banks.
现在银行给企业放松贷款政策，本意是好的，但治标不治本。
Banks are now easing lending to businesses, which is well intentioned, but palliative.
最直接的方法是银行停息几个月。
The most direct way is for the bank to stop for a few months.
复工，原来我想得太乐观我们是一家中型纺织企业。
Back to work, I thought too optimistic that we are a medium-sized textile enterprise.
我的业务涉及国内外。
My business involves both at home and abroad.
主要给一些国外知名大众服装品牌提供面料，国内也是。
Mainly for some foreign well-known popular clothing brands to provide fabrics, the country is also.
正常时期，我有500多个员工，一半是外地人。
In normal times, I have more than 500 employees, half of whom are outsiders.
2月14日，我拿到复工批复，当时我最担忧的是外地员工回不来。
On February 14, I received a reply, and my main concern was that the non-resident workers would not be able to return.
没有员工，我就复不了工。
I can't get back to work without staff.
我们员工安徽籍比较多，我当时准备了大巴去接他们，可是他们村里不让出来。
Our staff in Anhui more, I was prepared to take them by bus, but they did not let the village out.
我们提供复工证明也没用。
It is useless for us to provide proof of rework.
后来政府出台了一些助企复工政策，浙江甚至为我们企业包机、包专列去接复工人员。
Later, the government issued a number of policies to help enterprises back to work, Zhejiang even for our enterprise charter, bag special train to pick up workers.
作为企业，我们很高兴。
As an enterprise, we are very pleased.
刚复工时，我的到岗员工只有150多人，车间的机器运转起来了。
When I got back to work, I had only about 150 employees on the job and the machine in the workshop was up and running.
当时我觉得形势一片大好。
I thought the situation was very good.
我美美地预测，3月初，等我们员工全部到岗，我的公司就可以恢复正常。
By the beginning of March, when all our employees arrive, my company will be able to return to normal.
目前来看，我太乐观了。
At the moment, I'm too optimistic.
员工回来越多，我的压力就越大现在我的员工返城问题解决了，已经到岗300多个。
The more people come back, the more pressure I have And now my employees are back in town, Over 300 of them.
但我的订单出现了问题。
But there was a problem with my order.
我现在生产的订单，还是去年签订的国外订单。
The order I'm placing now is a foreign order I signed last year.
按目前员工到岗比例，再生产一个月就没有了。
According to the current ratio of staff to work, another month of production will not be available.
而我新的订单还不知在哪里飞？前两天，我跟国内非常知名的一家大众服装品牌的采购总负责人聊天。
Two days ago, I was chatting with the chief purchasing officer of a popular clothing brand in China.
他们也是进退两难。
They are also in a dilemma.
我们聊到下一步订单时，她说他们公司生产的春款还有一大批积压在仓库里。
When we talked about our next order, she said there was still a huge backlog of spring money from their company in the warehouse.
他们老板很头疼，也很无奈，说每天眼睛一睁400万元就没了。
Their boss is very headache, but also very helpless, said that every day the eyes opened 4 million yuan is gone.
他们企业是我公司在国内市场的主要客户，如果他们订单减少了，就意味着我今年日子不好过。
Their business is our main customer in the domestic market, and if they order less, it means I'm having a hard year.
而我的员工还在陆续回来，作为老板，我又不能说，你们不要来。
And my staff is still coming back, and as the boss, I can't say, you don't come.
我也不忍心。
I can't bear it.
我心里压力越来越大。
I'm getting more and more stressed.
我的员工回来越多，我的压力就越大。
The more my staff comes back, the more pressure I have.
他们回来，我不能让他们闲着，我只好做大路货的成品，堆在仓库里。
When they came back, I couldn't leave them idle. I had to make the finished goods and pile them in the warehouse.
我想帮他们，他们是我的员工。
I want to help them. They're my staff.
他们要生活。
They want to live.
他们有孩子需要接受教育，他们有房贷需要挣钱去还。
They have children who need education, they have a mortgage to make money to pay back.
可我最终还是那只小小小鸟，想飞总也飞不高。
But I am still that small bird finally, want to fly always not high.
因为这意味着，我要将手里的流动资金不断地变成滞销的库存物品。
Because this means that I have to constantly turn the liquidity in hand into unsold inventory.
这样的状况，我可以坚持一个月，两个月，那么第三个月，我还能持否？我好难。
This situation, I can insist on a month, two months, then the third month, I can still hold on to it? I am very difficult.
好想所有问题都自己扛，可我扛不久啊其实现在这样的企业有很多，手上没单子，或者单子不多，也要硬撑着复工。
Good think all the problems on their own, but I carry a long time in fact, there are a lot of such enterprises, or the list is not much, but also forced back to work.
我还算好的，目前还有订单在做，我手上流动资金也还有几千万元，有的企业手上流动资金早就没有了，如果生产的货又卖不出去，还继续生产，那真的太难了。
At present, I have orders in hand, and I have tens of millions of dollars in working capital. Some companies already have no working capital.
即使这样，我还是每天焦虑。
Even so, I worry every day.
我采购原料，我生产库存品，我员工的工资，我每个月要付的银行利息，还有水费、电费、税收，七七八八加起来，都是钱。
I buy Raw Materials, I Manufacture Stocks, My Employee Salaries, Bank Interest I Pay Each Month, And Water, Electricity, Taxes, Seventy-eight Together, All are Money.
就拿2月份来说，我银行利息付了50多万元，员工工资、水费电费、以及税收，七七八八加起来有200多万元。
In February, I paid over half a million yuan in bank interest, staff salaries, water bills, and taxes, which add up to over two million yuan.
如果500多个员工全部到岗，每个月光发工资就要二三百万元。
If more than 500 employees are on duty, each moonlight paycheck will cost two or three million yuan.
如果没有订单，我的货卖不出去，我手上现金还能付多少次二三百万元？而不管你生产，还是停产，你的货卖得出，还是卖不出，银行的利息照样要交。
How many times do I have to pay in cash if I can't sell my goods without an order? Whether you produce or shut down, you can't sell the goods, and the bank's interest is still due.
还好，我们厂房是自己的，不存在房租问题，有些企业还要交房租，这样一来，企业很快就会被拖垮。
Fortunately, our plant is their own, there is no rent problem, some companies have to pay rent, so enterprises will soon be dragged down.
所以，从我内心来讲，我现在有300个员工已经足够了。
So, from the bottom of my heart, I now have 300 employees enough.
我也想给国家减轻负担，把所有问题都自己扛，可我肩膀太窄，担子太重，扛不久啊。
I also want to lighten the burden on the country and carry all the problems on my own, but my shoulders are too narrow and the burden too heavy.
银行降息只是杯水车薪，治标不治本现在政府也在帮我们想办法，也在促进银行助力企业复工复产，但是银行能不能把政策落到实处，那还是另外一回事。
The government is helping us find ways to get banks back to work, but it's another matter if banks can get their policies back on track.
比如2月10日，浙江就出台了首批惠企政策。
On Feb. 10, for example, Zhejiang announced its first policies for beneficial companies.
其中第一条提到，“对现有存量贷款，各银行对制造业、批发零售业、住宿餐饮业等受疫情影响较重的行业，企业按不高于同档LPR利率计算2020年2月当期利息，最高给予免息政策。
Article 1 states, "For existing stock of loans, banks shall calculate current interest for February 2020 at a rate not higher than the same LPR rate for industries heavily affected by the epidemic, such as manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade and hotel and beverage industries, with a maximum interest-free policy."
”这个“最高”有可操作的标准吗？没有。
Is there an operational standard for the "highest"? No.
“最高”就是银行说了算。
The highest is what the bank says.
而且这条规定就针对2月份，那3月份呢？我公司就属于制造业。
And the rule is for February, what about March? Our company is in the manufacturing industry.
我们有享受到“最高”吗？没有。
Did we enjoy the "highest"? No.
我们2月份，几家银行加起来，原本要付利息55万左右，这次危机，几家银行加起来给我们优惠少付了5万多。
In February, several banks added up to pay about $550,000 in interest, and this time the banks collectively underpaid us more than $50,000.
这种降息对我们公司来说，真的是杯水车薪都不到。
This kind of rate cut is really a drop in the bucket for our company.
另外，银行给企业解决贷款，我认为这种方法治标不治本。
In addition, the bank gives the enterprise to solve the loan, I think this method cures the palliative.
而且银行放贷给什么企业也是有他们自己的标准的，即使放，也是有限的。
And banks have their own criteria for what they lend to, and if they do, there are limits.
再说，有些企业，你拼命给他放贷，本来只给他贷500万元，你加大力度，给他贷了1000万元。
Besides, some enterprises, you desperately give him a loan, originally only gave him 5 million yuan, you increased your efforts, gave him a 10 million yuan loan.
看起来这是好事啊，“你真的很爱我啊”，看起来，他手里的流动资金多好多啊，可是同样的，他身上背的债也多了，你银行追加的利息也多了。
It seems that this is a good thing, "you really love me," it seems, how much liquidity he has, but similarly, he has more debt on his back and more interest from your bank.
问题是，他生产的东西卖不出去，他手上的钱都变成了库存，最终你银行不但没有帮到他，反而增加了他的压力。
The problem is that he can't sell the things he produces and the money he has becomes an inventory. Instead of helping him, you end up putting more pressure on him.
这种情况下，你问银行“明天是否依然爱我”，显然不可能。
In this case, it is clearly impossible to ask the bank "Do you still love me tomorrow?"
所以，给企业放贷只是暂时的，并不能从根本上解决问题，那是治标不治本。
So lending to businesses is temporary, not a fundamental solution. It is a palliative.
把消费拉动起来，才能解决当前困境拉动消费是解决这一困境的唯一途径。
The only way to solve this dilemma is to pull up consumption so as to solve the current predicament.
等我们把这次疫情控制好，全方面放开，把消费拉动起来，这才是关键。
When we get this epidemic under control, let go of all aspects and pull up consumption, this is the key.
现在杭州街道上的人流越来越多，很多可以开放的地方也在开放。
There are more and more people on the streets of Hangzhou, and many places that can be opened up are also open.
这是好事。
That is good.
但这也只是暂时性的，即使有消费，那也是报复性的，并不会持久，待人们口袋里的余钱消费完，消费就会停滞。
But it is only temporary, and even if there is consumption, it is retaliatory, not permanent, and when people have run out of money left in their pockets, consumption will stagnate.
这样一来，社会整体购买力就会下降，随之而来就会发生一连串的不良反应，企业倒闭，员工失业。
As a result, the purchasing power of society as a whole would decline, with a cascade of adverse reactions, with firms failing and employees losing their jobs.
我们可能百分之八十的人有房贷。
Maybe 80 percent of us have a mortgage.
我们大多数家庭在买房前，已经美美地计划好，妻子挣的钱用来生活，包括子女方方面面的教育，还有衣食住行；丈夫挣的钱用来还房贷。
Most of our families have a good plan before we buy a house. Wives earn money to live on, including all aspects of their children's education, food, clothing and travel; husbands earn money to pay their mortgages.
可是现在遇上了这样的突发疫情，夫妻有一方下岗，或者夫妻俩都没有下岗，但工资变少了，这对一个家庭来说，都是重创。
But now there is an outbreak where one of the spouses is laid off or the couple is not laid off, but the salary is lower, which is a serious blow to a family.
家庭的计划被打破后，还房贷都成了问题，他们还拿什么来消费？而个人的购买力下降，直接受到影响的就是企业。
When family plans are broken and mortgage payments become a problem, what else do they use to spend? Businesses are directly affected by the decline in individuals' purchasing power.
企业也和个人一样，每个月的生产也都有计划。
Businesses, like individuals, have plans for every month of production.
企业每个月运转成本多少，单子怎么样。
How much is the monthly operating cost and how much is the list?
经过这么一次危机，大家的计划都被打破了。
After such a crisis, everyone's plans were broken.
比如我们纺织业，老百姓手里没钱了，用在买衣服上的钱少了。
For example, we textile industry, people have no money, spend less money on clothes.
生产衣服的厂家就会减少生产量，随之而来的连锁反应，就是我们提供面料的产业。
Clothing manufacturers will reduce production, with the ripple effect of our fabric industry.
我们的订单少了，我最先想到的可能是裁员，再不济很可能也会关门。
We have fewer orders, and the first thing that comes to mind may be layoffs, which are likely to close.
这就意味着，我们工厂的500多个员工将面临着再就业问题。
This means that more than 500 employees in our factory will face the problem of re-employment.
这样一来，我们的生态链就被彻底打破了，我们会进入一个死循环。
In this way, our ecological chain is completely broken, and we enter a dead-end cycle.
要想经济复苏，就要想办法打通整个生态链，而打通整个生态链，光靠复工是解决不了的。
Economic recovery requires finding ways to unlock the entire ecological chain, which cannot be solved by returning to work alone.
真正能有力促进消费的，就是银行停息现在唯一能拉动消费的最直接的方法是银行停息，而不是降息。
What really boosts consumption is that the only direct way banks can boost spending now is by stopping interest rates, not cutting them.
任何幅度的降息，对个人和企业都只是杯水车薪。
Any cut in interest rates would be a small price to pay for both individuals and businesses.
让企业贷款利息停几个月，企业可以缓口气，老百姓就不会失业；如果再让老百姓房贷停几个月，经济慢慢就会复苏。
Give companies a few months to stop paying interest on their loans, businesses can breathe a little easier, and ordinary people won't lose their jobs.
银行要多做雪中送炭的事，不要光锦上添花。
Banks should do more things in the snow, not just icing on the cake.
等消费拉动起来了，自然社会各方面都会好起来。
When consumption is pulled up, all aspects of natural society will be better.
这个时候，你让企业不复工，他们会想尽一切办法把工复起来。
This time, you let the business do not return to work, they will do everything possible to get back to work.
现在政府的政策有了，但问题的关键是银行有没有把政策落到实处。
Now the government's policies are in place, but the question is whether the banks are actually implementing them.
因为各家银行的贷款担保模式不同，我们大部分企业会把贷款放在好几家银行。
Because banks have different loan guarantee models, most of our businesses put their loans in several banks.
比如我们公司，我就跟好几家银行有信贷关系，我们工商银行贷了2000万元，农业银行也贷了2000万元，还有建行等等。
For example, my company, I have credit relations with several banks, our Industrial and Commercial Bank of 20 million yuan, Agricultural Bank of 20 million yuan, there are CCB and so on.
这样一来，各家银行谁都不会先给企业免息，谁免了，就等于把自己的利益拱手让给别人了。
In this way, each bank will not give the enterprise interest-free first, who avoids, is tantamount to giving away their own interests to others.
但从长期来看，企业不行了，整个经济都会出问题，银行也会出问题。
But in the long run, businesses fail, the economy as a whole goes wrong, and banks go wrong.
当雪崩来临时，每片雪花都躲不过。
When an avalanche comes, every snowflake can't hide.
银行都要把眼光放远一点，抱团取暖，统一行动。
Banks should take a long-term view, keep warm and act in unison.
如果银行不动起来，各打各的小算盘，那是很危险的，一系列的社会问题都会随之而来。
If the banks do not move, each fighting his own small calculation, it is very dangerous, a series of social problems will follow.
我在纺织这一行做了30多年，也曾遇到过各式各样的困难，但是办法总算比困难多。
I have been in the textile business for more than 30 years, and have encountered all kinds of difficulties, but the way is better than the difficulties.
总体来说，现在还是在往好的方向发展，我们杭州已经8天没有新增确诊病例了，政府的惠企政策也在不断增加。
On the whole, we are still going in the right direction. We have not had any new confirmed cases in Hangzhou for eight days, and the government's policy of benefiting enterprises is on the increase.
我相信，只要我们和政府上下齐心，一定就能度过这次难关。
I believe that as long as we work together with the government, we can make it through this difficult time.
