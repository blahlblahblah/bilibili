本报记者 夏治斌 张家振 上海 临沂报道“看和特斯拉公司的沟通情况，有可能最终选择七天无理由退车。
Our reporter Xia Zhibin Zhangjiazhen Shanghai Linyi reported that "look at the communication with Tesla company, may finally choose seven days no reason to return the car.
”3月4日，喜提特斯拉Model 3新车仅3天的魏欣（化名）萌生出了退车的想法。
On March 4, Wei Xin (not her real name), just three days after her new car, came up with the idea.
巧妇难为无米之炊。
No cross, no crown.
当天特斯拉官方承认，复工期间基于供应链状况，公司将一部分标准续航升级版Model 3安装的控制器硬件由HW3.0临时替换为了HW2.5。
Tesla officials admitted on the same day that the company had temporarily replaced HW3.0 with HW2.5-based controller hardware installed in the Standard Renewal Model 3 due to supply chain conditions.
魏欣刚购买的新车就遇到了同样的情况。
The new car Mr. Wei just bought is in the same boat.
这也意味着，受疫情对供应链的影响，特斯拉将复工期间生产的新车“减配”了。
This also means that Tesla will return to work during the production of new cars "cut" due to the impact of the epidemic on the supply chain.
据了解，2月10日，特斯拉位于上海临港的超级工厂在关闭10余天后正式宣布复工复产，有望重新恢复1.2万辆/月左右的产能。
On Feb. 10, Tesla's Shanghai-based superplant officially resumed production after more than 10 days of shut-down, and is expected to resume production capacity of around 12,000 units per month.
不过，复工并不意味着高枕无忧，如何在短期内重构遍布全球的产业链，实现产能协同，正成为包括特斯拉在内的众多整车厂面临的全新挑战。
But getting back to work does not mean that we can rest easy. How to rebuild the global industrial chain and realize productive synergy in the short term is becoming a new challenge for many vehicle factories, including Tesla.
3月3日下午5时许，《中国经营报》记者在特斯拉上海工厂看到，6辆红黑两色的国产Model 3从工厂踏上交付业主的路途，门外不停作业的挖掘机、厂区内来往的运输车无不透露出工厂的繁忙景象。
At about 5 p.m. on March 3, the China Business Daily reporter saw at the Tesla Shanghai factory that six Chinese-made Model 3 in red and black were on the way from the factory to the delivery of the owner.
而对于复工状况、产业链协同以及核心部件涉嫌“减配”等问题，本报记者多次致函、致电特斯拉方面，截至发稿未获回复。
And for the resumption of work, industrial chain coordination and core components suspected of "reduction", the reporter wrote letters, called Tesla, as of the draft received no response.
“减配门”旋涡3月1日，安徽芜湖人魏欣收到了“这辈子最大的快递”——一辆从南京发来的灰色特斯拉电动车停到了其所在小区的路边。
"Subtractive Door" Vortex On March 1, Wei Xin of Wuhu, Anhui Province, received "the biggest express in his life" - a grey Tesla electric car from Nanjing stopped at the side of the road in his neighborhood.
魏欣戴着口罩按捺不住内心的激动，在特斯拉引擎盖上签下了收货单。
Weishin, wearing a mask, could not restrain his excitement and signed the receipt report on the hood of Tesla.
这辆特斯拉是魏欣在2020年元旦期间下的单，从付款到收车等待了整整两个月的时间。
The Tesla is Wei Xin in the 2020 New Year's Day period under the single, from the payment to the car waiting for a full two months.
据其介绍，购买特斯拉共花费了30余万元，其中购车款29.9万元，灰色加价8000元，保险6000元，免购置税。
Tesla bought more than 300,000 yuan, including 299,000 yuan for cars, 8,000 yuan for grey and 6,000 yuan for insurance, according to Tesla.
“特喜欢，去店里一眼就看上了，下单特快。
"I like it very much. I like it at a glance and order very fast.
”魏欣这样描述当时购车的心情。
"Wei describes how she was buying cars.
不过，提车的喜悦心情很快散去，特斯拉将控制器硬件由HW3.0临时替换为HW2.5的做法让她如鲠在喉。
However, the joy of carrying the car soon dissipated and Tesla stuck in her throat by temporarily replacing the controller hardware from HW3.0 to HW2.5.
“现在还没有任何消息，暂时只能等，我需要企业就欺瞒行为有所表态。
"There's no news yet, just wait. I need companies to take a stand on deceit.
公司如果事前说明，最起码可以保障消费者选择权，但先把车交付了等着消费者自己去发现很不应该。
Companies can at least guarantee consumers the right to choose if they say so in advance, but it would be wrong to leave the car to consumers to find out for themselves.
”3月4日，魏欣告诉记者，这两天交涉无果的话她会考虑退车，毕竟特斯拉官方也同意“七天无理由退车”。
On March 4, Wei told reporters she would consider returning the car after two days of fruitless negotiations, after the Tesla authorities agreed "there is no reason to return the car for seven days."
据了解，3月3日有多名消费者投诉称，特斯拉新交付的Model 3搭载的整车控制器硬件版本与环保随车清单上报备的版本不一致，清单上显示的HW3.0版本被“减配”为HW2.5版本。
On March 3, consumers complained that the hardware version of the whole-vehicle controller on Tesla's new Model 3 did not match the version reported on the green-car manifest, and that the version of HW3.0 shown on the list had been "subtracted" to version HW2.5.
HW3.0即Hardware3.0中央控制单元，特斯拉称其为FSD（全自动驾驶计算机），是Model 3车型实现完全制动驾驶能力所需的核心硬件。
HW3.0, or Hardware 3.0 Central Control Unit, which Tesla describes as FSD, is the core hardware required to achieve full braking driving capability on Model 3.
特斯拉官网此前曾公开表示，由特斯拉自主研发的HW3.0芯片，每秒可处理高达 2300帧的图像，是之前硬件运算速度的21倍。
Tesla has said publicly that the HW3.0 chip, developed by Tesla itself, can process up to 2,300 frames per second, 21 times the speed of the previous hardware.
而上一代产品HW2.5每秒图像处理能力仅为110帧。
The previous generation, HW2.5, had only 110 image processing capabilities per second.
特斯拉在3月3日中午发布《说明》解释称，特斯拉上海超级工厂于2月10日开始复工生产，期间基于供应链状况，一部分标准续航升级版Model 3安装的硬件为HW2.5。
The Tesla Shanghai super-plant resumed production on February 10, Tesla explained in a statement released at noon on March 3, during which part of the upgraded Model 3 standard operating hardware was HW2.5 based on the supply chain conditions.
随着产能以及供应链恢复，公司将按计划陆续为控制器硬件为HW2.5的Model 3车主提供免费更换HW3.0服务。
With capacity and supply chain recovery, the company is scheduled to offer free replacement of HW3.0 for Model 3 owners whose controller hardware is HW2.5.
对于特斯拉的行为，上海市海华永泰律师事务所高级合伙人黄剑林律师向记者表示，根据特斯拉官方发布的公告，特斯拉因自身供应链问题而私自替换控制器硬件，且在明知的情况下未提前告知相关消费者或在交车时退还消费者相应差价，在车辆销售过程中涉嫌欺诈。
Huang Jianlin, a senior partner at Shanghai-based Haihua Yongtai Law Firm, told reporters that Tesla had replaced the controller's hardware because of his supply chain problems and was suspected of fraud in the sale of the vehicle by knowingly failing to inform the relevant consumers in advance or refund the corresponding price difference when handing over the car.
该行为已涉嫌违反《反不正当竞争法》《广告法》及《消费者权益保护法》等诸多法律规定，可能将面临市场监管部门的行政处罚，以及需赔偿消费者损失等。
It is suspected of violating various legal provisions, such as the Anti-Unfair Competition Act, the Advertising Law and the Consumer Rights and Interests Protection Law, and may face administrative sanctions from the market regulator, as well as compensation for consumer losses.
有消息称，随着特斯拉“减配”事件持续发酵，国产model 3已经停止交付。
It is reported that with the Tesla "subtraction" incident continued to ferment, domestic model 3 has stopped delivery.
天津的准车主李先生也告诉记者，本来约定这周提车，现在反馈说要延期交付，希望事情得到妥善解决，能早日提车。
Mr. Li, the would-be owner of Tianjin, also told reporters that he had agreed to pick up the car this week, and now reports back that delivery would be delayed.
不过，记者从多位上海特斯拉销售人员处获悉，目前Model 3还在正常交付，现在交付的Model 3装配的都是HW3.0。
However, a number of Shanghai-based Tesla salespeople were told that Model 3 was still being delivered normally and that the model 3 was now being delivered with HW3.0.
“现在可以线上操作购买，现在买的话可以免购置税，赠送牌照及24750元购车补贴。
"Now you can buy it online. Now you can buy it free of purchase tax, with a licence and a subsidy of 24,750 yuan for cars.
”复工之路3月3日下午，记者在特斯拉位于上海临港的超级工厂看到，厂区内的运输车辆往来穿梭，呈现出一派繁忙的景象。
"The road back to work on the afternoon of March 3, Tesla's Shanghai Lingang super-factory, the transport vehicle shuttle between the factory area, showing a busy scene.
据记者了解，除老员工返岗复工外，特斯拉在年后还招聘了一些新员工。
In addition to returning to work, Tesla recruited some new employees after the year, according to reporters.
一位刚入职的员工告诉记者，自己是2019年底投的简历，等了两个月才面试，现在还在培训期，不清楚工厂内的生产情况。
A new employee told reporters he had waited two months for an interview on his resume, submitted at the end of 2019, and was still in training, unaware of production at the plant.
在厂区施工工地，一位在特斯拉厂区负责基建工程施工的外包负责人也告诉记者：“很多公司都在里面施工，现在厂内的车间都工作了，每天有好几辆装满新车的物流运输车出厂。
"A lot of companies are working in the factory and now the workshops are working and several logistics trucks are out of the factory every day full of new cars," he told reporters.
”受疫情影响，特斯拉上海工厂曾于1月30日宣布暂时关闭，线下销售门店也于此后的2月2日起暂时关闭。
Tesla's Shanghai plant was temporarily closed on January 30 and its offline stores were temporarily closed on February 2, affected by the outbreak.
2月10日，在经历10余天的短暂停工后，特斯拉上海超级工厂正式复工复产，线下门店也从2月17日起陆续恢复营业。
On February 10, after a brief 10-day shutdown, the Tesla Shanghai super-factory officially resumed production, and the offline stores resumed operations from February 17.
停工导致订单积压也让复工后的特斯拉快马加鞭，加速产能恢复工作。
The shutdown led to a backlog of orders that allowed Tesla to resume work and accelerate capacity recovery.
一位特斯拉车间员工向记者表示，他就是2月10日来工厂上班的，“这段时间忙，都在加班。
A Tesla workshop employee told reporters that he had come to work at the factory on February 10. "It's been a busy time, working overtime.
”据特斯拉防疫联络员、中国（上海）自由贸易试验区临港新片区管理委员会（以下简称“临港新片区管委会”）高新产业和科技创新处主任科员孙筱和介绍，预计超级工厂将实现每月1.2万辆左右的产能，“这个数字还会逐渐上升。
According to Sun Xiaohe, Tesla's epidemic prevention liaison and head of China's new branch of high-tech industry and science, technology and innovation, the country's pilot free-trade zone, Sun Xiaohe, said the number was expected to rise.
”上海市政府官方网站刊载消息称，从正月初八（2月1日）接到通知起，孙筱和就多了一个“办公室”——特斯拉超级工厂。
No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
每天他都在相隔20公里的管委会与特斯拉工厂间奔波，为特斯拉解决复工复产遇到的各种困难，并检查工厂的防疫工作情况。
Every day he travels between the MRC and the Tesla factory, 20 kilometers apart, to resolve Tesla's difficulties in getting back to work and to check on the plant's vaccination efforts.
员工按时复岗、及时补充工作人员是复工的前提。
Reentry of employees on time, timely replenishment of staff is a prerequisite for the resumption of work.
上海临港创新经济发展服务有限公司总经理龚伟表示，特斯拉在年前就招聘了数百名新员工。
Gong Wei, general manager of Shanghai Lingang Innovative Economic Development Services, said Tesla recruited hundreds of new employees a year ago.
按原计划，这些员工将于年后入职，但受疫情影响，部分来自疫情重点地区的人员还暂时无法来沪。
It was planned that the employees would be on board by the end of this year, but due to the outbreak, some people from key areas of the epidemic were temporarily unable to come to Shanghai.
2月22日，特斯拉举办网络招聘会，通过网络面试渠道招聘生产一线急需的质量、物流、涂装车间员工，为一线车间产能扩张“招兵买马”，同时着手拓宽道路，以匹配更多的人员、车辆、物料出入。
On February 22, Tesla held an online job fair to recruit first-line employees for quality, logistics and painting workshops through online interview channels, expand production capacity in front-line workshops and expand the road to match more people, vehicles and materials.
据了解，临港新片区管委会出台相关措施，筹集总量不低于1000套公租房、人才公寓和简易经济型旅店用于重点企业居家隔离和员工住宿。
It is understood that the new Lingang District Management Committee issued relevant measures to raise a total of not less than 1,000 public rental housing, talent apartments and simple and economical hotels for key enterprises for home isolation and staff accommodation.
仅特斯拉一家就有100多名合租员工和近500名新入职员工住进了人才公寓。
The Tesla family alone has more than 100 co-workers and nearly 500 new hires in talent apartments.
“昨天刚来上海，临时住在特斯拉安排的小区里，现在还在隔离，说是先在这边观察半个月。
"I just came to Shanghai yesterday and temporarily stayed in the Tesla compound, and I'm still in quarantine," he said.
”3月4日，一位新入职的装配工李思特（化名）向记者表示。
On March 4, a new assembly worker, Liszt (not his real name), told reporters.
与特斯拉同步，上海临港均胜汽车安全系统有限公司（以下简称“临港均胜公司”）等多个配套产业链上的企业也加急审批实现了按期复工。
With Tesla synchronization, Shanghai Lingang Tongsheng Automotive Safety System Co. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Lingang Tongsheng Company") and other supporting industrial chain enterprises have also accelerated the approval of the scheduled resumption of work.
据了解，临港均胜公司位于临港蓝湾未来城，与特斯拉上海超级工厂相距不远。
It is understood that Lingang Shengsheng Company is located in the future city of Blue Bay, near the Tesla Shanghai Superfactory.
据总经理奚晓华介绍，公司目前复工率已达60%，产能已恢复超过五成。
According to Xi Xiaohua, general manager, the company has resumed work rate of 60%, capacity has been restored to more than 50%.
临港均胜公司为宁波均胜电子股份有限公司（以下简称“均胜电子”，600699.SH）子公司。
Lingang Sunshine Company is a subsidiary of Ningbo Junsheng Electronics Co. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Tongsheng Electronics", 600699.SH).
根据均胜电子公告，临港均胜公司为特斯拉 Model 3和 Model Y车型的供应商，为其提供方向盘、安全气囊等汽车安全系统产品。
According to the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y models, Tesla Motel 3 and Model Y are supplied with automotive safety system products such as steering wheels and airbags, according to the Tshusheng e-Bulletin.
单一供应商风险资料显示，特斯拉Model 3供应链涉及包括动力总成系统、电驱系统、充电、底盘、车身、其他构件、中控系统、内饰和外饰等10个部分，涉及直接、间接供应商130余家。
According to the single vendor risk profile, the Tesla Model 3 supply chain comprises 10 parts, including power assembly systems, electrical drive systems, charging, chassis, bodywork, other components, central control systems, interior and exterior elements, and involves more than 130 direct and indirect suppliers.
其中，特斯拉的核心技术供应商大部分来自日本、美国和欧洲，国内企业约占半壁江山，但大多作为二级原材料供应商进入供应链体系。
Tesla's core technology suppliers are mostly from Japan, the US and Europe, with domestic companies accounting for about half of the total, but mostly entering the supply chain as secondary suppliers of raw materials.
根据特斯拉此前透露的数据，目前下线的国产Model 3零部件国产率为30%，在不断增加国产零部件供应后，2020年中特斯拉零部件国产率可达80%，年底可实现100%国产化。
According to Tesla's previous figures, the domestic model 3 component production rate is now 30 per cent, with Tesla's parts and components expected to be 80 per cent by mid-2020 and 100 per cent domestically by the end of the year, following a steady increase in the supply of domestically produced parts.
这也意味着，目前特斯拉零部件超七成还需要进口。
It also means that more than 70% of Tesla's parts now need to be imported.
以最核心的锂电池组为例，特斯拉Model 3锂电池PACK制造商为日本松下，正极材料和隔膜供应商为日本住友化学，负极材料供应商为日本日立化学，电解液由日本三菱化学生产。
In the case of the most core lithium battery group, the manufacturer of Tesla Model 3 lithium battery PACK is Panasonic Japan, the cathode material and diaphragm supplier is Sumitomo Chemical of Japan, the negative material supplier is Hitachi Chemical and the electrolyte is produced by Mitsubishi Chemical, Japan.
疫情对特斯拉供应链带来的冲击问题正在浮出水面。
The impact of the epidemic on the Tesla supply chain is emerging.
特斯拉方面在2月13日公布的年度申报文件中承认：“单一供应商和健康流行病是公司业务面临的重大风险。
"A single supplier and a health epidemic are major risks to the company's business," Tesla acknowledged in its annual filing on February 13.
”据了解，随着零部件供应链国产化的逐步推进，特斯拉正试图通过新增供应商的方式规避独供模式带来的风险。
Mr Tesla is understood to be trying to avoid the risks posed by the exclusive supply model by adding new suppliers as the home-grown parts supply chain evolves.
以动力电池为例，宁德时代2月3日发布公告称，公司拟与特斯拉签订协议，将于今年7月起至2022年6月向特斯拉供应锂离子动力电池产品，产品采购量须以特斯拉后续具体采购订单为准。
The company plans to sign an agreement with Tesla to supply lithium-ion battery products to Tesla from July this year until June 2022, the company said in a statement on Feb. 3.
在投资者电话会议上，特斯拉负责人也透露，将新增 LG 和宁德时代作为公司的电池合作伙伴，具体细节将在今年4月份的“电池日”上进一步透露。
In a conference call with investors, Tesla's chief executive also revealed the addition of LG and Ningde as the company's battery partners, details of which will be revealed on Battery Day in April.
这也意味着，特斯拉的动力电池供应商或由此前的松下独供转变为松下、LG 化学和宁德时代共同供应。
It also means that Tesla's power-cell supplier, or Matsushita's former proprietary Panasonic, was transformed into Matsushita, LG Chemistry, and Ningde.
不过，在国金证券分析师张帅看来，在特斯拉零部件体系中，技术壁垒越高的零部件环节越难国产化替代，国内已经掌握设计制造且具成本优势的细分领域，以及材料或物流占主导因素的领域有望先进行替代。
However, according to Zhang Shuai, an analyst at Golden State Securities, the higher the technical barriers in the Tesla component system, the more difficult it is to replace the higher the technical barriers, the better the domestic design and manufacturing and cost advantages of segmentation, and materials or logistics dominant areas are expected to be the first to replace.
记者梳理上市公司公告发现，今年2月份以来，多家国内供应商称已被纳入特斯拉供应链体系。
Reporters combed announcements of listed companies and found that since February, a number of domestic suppliers said they had been integrated into the Tesla supply chain.
例如，2月7日，华达汽车科技股份有限公司公告称，近期公司已开始向特斯拉供货，根据公司已中标产品及特斯拉目前产能测算，预计公司 2020 年特斯拉相关营业收入约 1 亿元左右；同日，浙江银轮机械股份有限公司也公告称，公司目前已通过特斯拉质量体系认证，双方正在积极推进多个热管理项目的业务合作。
For example, on February 7, Huada Automotive Technology Co., Ltd. announced that it had recently begun to supply Tesla, based on the company's winning products and Tesla's current production capacity, the company is expected to about 100 million Tesla related revenue in 2020.
高精地图供应商北京四维图新科技股份有限公司（以下简称“四维图新”，002405.SZ）从2014年开始就持续为特斯拉中国车辆提供全系前装车载导航电子地图数据及服务。
High-precision map supplier Beijing 4-D map new technology Co. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "four-dimensional map new," 002405.SZ) has been continuously providing Tesla Chinese vehicles with full-department front-mounted navigation electronic map data and services since 2014.
对于公司复工情况，四维图新相关负责人表示，公司刚刚复工，还有一部分员工还是在家办公。
As for the company's resumption of work, the relevant four-dimensional chart Xinxin said that the company has just resumed work, and some of the staff are still working from home.
“公司一直是特斯拉的合作供应商，但现在不是独家。
"The company has been Tesla's partner, but it's not exclusive right now.
”而特斯拉此次将控制器硬件由HW3.0临时替换为HW2.5的行为归因于疫情导致的供应链问题，同样值得关注。
Tesla's temporary replacement of controller hardware from HW3.0 to HW2.5 is also a cause for concern, as is the supply chain problem caused by the outbreak.
“‘减配’行为已经构成违约，消费者可以根据《合同法》以及签署销售合同的条款向特斯拉主张违约责任。
"The 'allocation' already constitutes a breach of contract, and the consumer can assert liability to Tesla under the Contract Law and the terms of the contract of sale.
”黄剑林称，“供应链出现问题不是经营者可以私自减配且不提前告知消费者的抗辩事由，消费者有法定的知情权，若消费者发现自己的权益受到侵害，可以向市场监督管理局进行投诉、举报，或者向当地的消协反映、求助，也可直接向当地法院提起诉讼，维护自己的合法权益。
"Problems in the supply chain are not the subject of private distribution and consumers are not informed in advance," Huang said. "Consumers have the legal right to know, and if they find their rights and interests are infringed, they can complain to and report to the CMA, report to the local consumer association, or file a lawsuit directly with the local court to defend their legitimate rights and interests.
”就特斯拉涉嫌“减配”问题的调查情况，记者多次致电并致函上海市浦东新区市场监督管理局了解调查进展，但截至发稿未获进一步回复。
Regarding the investigation into Tesla's alleged "allocation" problem, the reporter called and wrote to the Pudong New District Market Supervision Authority in Shanghai several times to find out the progress of the investigation, but no further reply had been received.
