曾经被人羡慕着可以搭乘撤侨飞机回到安全地的加拿大人，怎么也不会想到，有一天，我们也要经历停课、所有公共场所强制关闭、抢购、缺货的生活。
Canadians who were envious of being able to return to safety on the evacuation plane never imagined that one day we would have to go through a life of class suspension, forced closures of all public places, panic buying, and stock-outs.
文 | 艾琳一个月前，谁都没有想到，我们这也会经历这样的乱世。
Not a month ago, no one expected that we would be in such a mess.
3月12日，我所在的蒙特利尔还在观望着疫情会如何发展。
On March 12, my country, Montreal, was watching to see how the epidemic would unfold.
关于是否停课，还只处于某些个别出现疑似病例的学校的部分年级停课。
With regard to the suspension of classes, only part of the grade of certain schools with individual suspected cases is suspended.
魁北克省的学校春假比安大略省早一周开始，公立学校从3月2日起放一周，私立学校放两周。
In Québec schools, spring breaks begin a week earlier than in Ontario, with public schools running for a week from March 2 and private schools for two weeks.
春假基本上是憋了一个冬天的加拿大人疯狂出游的时间。
Spring Break is basically a time when winter Canadians go on a wild outing.
于是，3月12日当天，我和一些朋友开始担心学校一旦复课，那些从四面八方赶回来上班和上课的人会带来什么不可预料的情况。
So, on March 12, some of my friends and I began to worry about the unpredictability that would ensue if schools were to resume classes and those who would come back from all directions to work and attend school.
当天晚上关于总理夫人病毒测试是否成阳性的新闻基本处于猜疑阶段。
News late that night that the Prime Minister's wife virus test positive for the news is basically in the suspicion stage.
下班回家，我妈第一句话就说，特鲁多的老婆也被确诊了。
When I got home from work, my mother said in the first sentence that Trudeau's wife had been diagnosed.
我说，假新闻。
I said, fake news.
现在所有消息都必须找到主流媒体的原文，否则不能相信。
All news must now find the original language of the mainstream media, otherwise it cannot be believed.
第二天一早，总理夫人被确诊的消息就出现了。
Early the next morning, the news emerged that the Prime Minister's wife had been diagnosed.
加拿大总理特鲁多及夫人苏菲与此同时，3月12日下午开始朋友圈就出现了超市抢购厕纸的消息。
Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau and his wife Sophie Meanwhile, the news of a supermarket buying toilet paper began in the afternoon of March 12.
有朋友得意地在群里说，下午2点在郊外的Costco还是满满的货，听他话的朋友都轻而易举地买到了所有物品。
A friend proudly told the group that Costco was still full at 2 p. m., and friends who listened to him easily bought everything.
等到晚上6点再去同一个Costco，货架全部清空。
Wait until 6 p. m. to go to the same Costco and empty the shelves.
3月13日，我们在蒙特利尔明显感到疫情的情况已急转直下。
On 13 March, in Montreal, we clearly sensed a sharp decline in the epidemic.
魁北克省长François Legault在直播新闻发布会上宣布了强硬的抗疫政策，包括魁省所有日托、学校、预科（魁省的教育体制与法国相同，在升入大学前会有2年的预科教育）和大学将关闭至少两周。
François Legault, Québec's Minister, announced a tough anti-epidemic policy at a live news conference, including all day care, schools, and preparatory courses in Québec (which has the same education system as in France, with two years of preparatory education before entering university) and universities will be closed for at least two weeks.
所有图书馆、社区体育场馆一律关闭，直至另行通知为止。
All libraries and community sports venues are closed until further notice.
实际上，大多数学校在3月13日当天已经关闭。
In fact, most schools were closed on 13 March.
政府将为医务卫生工作人员和其他基本服务工作者的子女设立特殊日托，好让这些工作人员能够继续正常工作。
The Government will establish special day-care facilities for children of medical and health workers and other essential service workers to enable them to continue their normal work.
3月13日周五早上的蒙特利尔地铁，乘客十分稀少 图 |受访者除此以外，卫生当局还限制了蒙特利尔部分医院和疗养院的访问。
In addition to the few people interviewed at Montreal's subway station on Friday morning, March 13, health authorities have restricted visits to some Montreal hospitals and sanatoriums.
不仅如此，对于本省所有70岁以上的老人，省长也提出了居家自我隔离的要求，避免感染风险。
Not only that, but for all the province's over 70-year-old people, the governor also made the home self-isolation requirements, to avoid the risk of infection.
省长表示，魁北克必须对中国此前抗疫过程中收集到的数据进行分析，学习中国的经验。
The governor said Quebec must analyze data collected during China's previous fight against the disease and learn from its experience.
随后，蒙特利尔交通局(STM)也宣布，禁止其所有雇员到魁北克省以外的地区旅行，无论是个人旅行还是工作旅行，否则他们将不得不被隔离。
Subsequently, the Montreal Transport Authority (STM) also announced that all its employees would be prohibited from travelling to areas outside Quebec, whether for personal or work travel, otherwise they would have to be segregated.

STM also said it would daily clean the most common surfaces used by metro and bus services, including handrails, escalators, lifts and ticket machines.
抢购+囤货，却没人戴口罩在抢购囤货的消息传了两天后，上周六我终于有空去了趟超市。
After two days of rumored hoarding and no one wearing a mask, I finally got free to go to the supermarket on Saturday.
Costco从几周前就开始为进门的每位客人提供消毒纸巾擦拭购物车。
Costco started wiping the cart with sterile paper towels for every guest entering the house a few weeks ago.
3月14日进超市，除了擦车的消毒纸外，还有专门擦手的消毒纸。

取消了所有试吃服务的Costco在生鲜冰柜上摆放了消毒纸巾。

当天的Costco专门辟出一个角落发放纸质产品。

卫生纸、厨房纸、餐巾纸已变成限量发放。
Toilet paper, kitchen paper, napkin have become limited distribution.
在结账区，工作人员还会检查每辆推车，是否超额购买。

除了纸质用品限量供应外，漂白水、消毒纸巾和液体肥皂全部断货。
In addition to the limited supply of paper supplies, bleach, disinfectant paper towels and liquid soap were all out of stock.
尽管朋友圈陆续出现Costco“报复性”补货的图片，实际上，3月15日所有超市的纸质商品都处于限购状态，消毒产品依然缺货。
Despite images of Costco's "retaliatory" replenishments, virtually all supermarket paper items were on sale on March 15, and disinfection products remained out of stock.
从大到Costco这样的仓储式超市，小到街区药房，所有与消毒有关的产品一律缺货，并且限购。
From warehouse supermarkets like Costco to block pharmacies, all disinfection-related products are out of stock and subject to restrictions.
然而，最令人费解的是，几百人拥挤在一处抢购厕纸，居然没有一个人戴口罩。
Most puzzling, however, was the fact that hundreds of people crowded into a toilet paper and none of them wore a mask.
蒙特利尔Costco里民众抢购厕纸，却无人戴口罩图 |受访者紧张囤货的蒙特利尔，去晚一点就没有厕纸可买的蒙特利尔，街上戴口罩的少之又少。
Montreal Costco, where people snapped up toilet paper but didn't wear face masks, is one of the few places in Montreal where stock-outs are high and where there is little toilet paper to buy later.
路上偶然见到戴口罩的人绝大多数是华人面孔。
Most of the people who happened to be wearing masks on the road were Chinese.
尽管本地人不戴口罩，但所有药房早在1个多月前口罩基本都缺货。
Although locals are not wearing masks, most pharmacies were out of stock more than a month ago.
过去，本地代购们将口罩运回国。
In the past, local buyers carried masks home.
现在，各大微信群里在登记人数从国内运口罩到加拿大。

On the morning of March 15, the downtown Chinatown in Montreal was empty, and late-night word came that most of the restaurants in Chinatown would be closed Monday.
然后，与这些不缺客人的名店相比，各个在街巷间生存的小餐厅日子就变得非常困难了。
Then, compared with the famous shops, which have no shortage of guests, it is very difficult to live in the canteen.
蒙特利尔唐人街 图|受访者我在蒙特利尔经营着一家有着近20年历史的寿司店。

我家旁边有一家挺出名的葡萄牙烤鸡店，周末就餐需要预约，否则一位难求。
Next to my house is a famous Portuguese roast chicken restaurant, which requires an appointment for a weekend meal.
3月13日下午，餐厅经理一脸愁容告诉我，他们当天所有的定位都被取消，客人的理由就是怕病毒传染。
On the afternoon of March 13, the manager of the restaurant told me with a scowl that all their positions had been canceled that day.
目前，他们正在商量是否有必要暂停营业，以降低损失。
