面对这次的疫情大考首汽约车成为了一个散发微光的聚力平台“日月同光，粤汉同心！谢谢你们！”“感谢你们不辞辛苦，像家人一样照顾我们！等疫情结束有机会一定要来广东玩！”“谢谢司机大哥们日夜兼程，耐心体贴，让我们上下班路上也不孤单，温暖如初。
"Thank you for taking the trouble to take care of us like your family!" "Thank you for taking the trouble to take care of us like your family!" "Thank you for the opportunity to play in Guangdong when the epidemic is over!
”这是广东佛山援鄂医疗队在离开武汉的前一晚，偷偷在酒店大厅做的“感谢墙”上的文字。
This is the text on the thank-you wall secretly made in the hotel lobby the night before Guangdong's Hubei medical team left Wuhan.
当所有人都在对援鄂医疗队致以谢意的时候，他们却以这种方式，对武汉志愿者、首汽约车驾驶员和酒店工作人员进行了“深情告白”。
While everyone was thanking the medical team in Hubei, they made a "heartfelt confession" to Wuhan volunteers, drivers of the first car and hotel staff.
广东佛山援鄂医疗队为志愿服务者们特意做的“感谢墙”在过去50多天的时间里，除了这些奋战在一线的医护人员，无数企业和更多像志愿者、首汽约车驾驶员一样的普通人，都加入到了抗“疫”的第一线，他们在自己的岗位上不辞辛苦，共同为这座城市点亮前行的路。
Over the past 50 days, along with the medical staff on the ground, countless enterprises and more ordinary people like volunteers and drivers of cars have joined the frontline of the epidemic. They have worked hard at their posts to light up the city.
为了了解他们与这座城市的故事，过去几天，我们找了几位首汽约车的司机聊了聊，有许多感动，还有更多期待。
In order to understand the story of them and the city, we have talked to a few bus drivers in the past few days, there are many touched, there are more expectations.
再想到我们的时候，希望他们的回忆中有武汉最美的样子杨义明在首汽约车做专车司机有些年头了，这次加入首汽约车组织的“外地援汉医疗队保障团队”，也是他主动报的名。
When I think of us, I hope that their memories of Wuhan's most beautiful appearance Yang Yiming in the first car to do some years as a dedicated car driver, this time joined the ACV "foreign medical support team," which he volunteered to name.
“收到志愿车队邀请函的时候，儿子第一个不同意。
"My son was the first to disagree when I received the letter of invitation for the motorcade.
”杨义明的儿子去年刚刚当兵回来，在疫情初期就成了志愿者，他知道儿子担心家里两个人万一都染上病，妻子可能无法承受这个结果。
Yang Yiming, whose son returned from the army last year and became a volunteer in the early stages of the epidemic, knows his son fears that his wife may not be able to bear the consequences if both members of his family fall ill.
“吉人自有天相。
Good people have their own way.
再说，要是人人都怕，不是没人来干这个事了吗？”凭借这个理由，杨义明勉强说服了家人，开车四十多公里从孝感赶往武汉。
Besides, if everyone is afraid, no one will do it.For this reason, Yang reluctantly convinced his family to drive more than 40 kilometers from filial piety to Wuhan.
2月21日，首汽约车安排他和另外两名驾驶员为江西第九批援鄂医疗队和江西赣州医疗队做后勤保障工作。
On Feb. 21, SAIC arranged for him and two other drivers to provide logistic support for the 9th medical team in Jiangxi Province and Ganzhou Medical Team in Jiangxi Province.
江西医疗队为杨义明他们写了手写感谢信两个医疗队，170个人，除了正常上下班有两辆大巴接送外，其他时间医护人员用车和运送物资全靠他们三个，算下来平均每人每天要跑300公里，“跑得快一点、时间长一点，三个人也没什么问题。
The medical team in Jiangxi wrote a handwritten thank-you note to Yang Yiming. Two medical teams, 170 of them, depend on them for their transportation and supplies at all times except for two regular buses to and from work.
”杨义明口中的“时间长”，不仅仅是指需要24小时随时待命，还包含比以前更复杂的“洗车”时间。
Yang Yiming calls "long" not only the need for 24-hour standby, but also the more complicated time involved in "washing the car."
往常一天一次的清洁，如今接送一次医护人员就要立即用酒精消毒，车内经常被碰触到的内外门把手、车窗升降钮、头枕前后等位置，他更是耐心地反复擦拭好几遍，“不仅为了医护人员，也是对自己和家人负责。
Once a day for cleaning, he now disinfects his paramedics with alcohol once a day, and the inside and outside door knobs, window knobs, headrest and so on that are often touched in the car. He rubbed them patiently and repeatedly, "not only for the paramedics, but for himself and his family.
”用来给车消毒的酒精等防疫物资，是杨义明在加入首汽约车保障团队前的培训上领到的。
The alcohol and other anti-epidemic materials used to disinfect cars were given to Mr. Yang in training before joining the SAIC support team.
为这些奔波在一线的驾驶员提供消毒防护用品，保障他们的健康和安全，是首汽约车目前最关注的一件事。
To provide these on-line drivers with disinfection protective equipment to protect their health and safety, is the FAW car is the most concerned thing at present.
因此，除了为司机们发放口罩、防护服、护目镜和酒精之外，首汽约车还为他们准备了一份保护全面的商业保险。
So, in addition to supplying the drivers with masks, protective clothing, goggles and alcohol, FAW has a fully protected commercial insurance policy.
保障车队人员整装待发“现在我们没那么忙了，证明治愈人数越来越多，接送医疗队的时候能感受到他们的开心。
"We're not that busy right now," he says. "We're proving that there are more and more people being healed and that they're happy to be with the medical team.
”杨义明的声音里带着一丝愉悦，“之前忙的日子，总有医护人员坐车的时候对我道谢，可我们做好后勤保障是应该的，和他们的工作比根本算不上辛苦。
"Yang Yiming's voice had a tinge of joy in his voice." On busy days, there were always paramedics who thanked me when they were in the car, but we were supposed to do the logistics, and their work wasn't that hard.
”采访杨义明的那个下午，武汉正是春光明媚的好时候，他服务的两个援鄂医疗队也在连续工作20多天后，有了停歇安顿等待调动的一天休息日。
The afternoon of the interview with Yang Yiming, Wuhan was a bright spring day, and after more than 20 days of continuous service, two medical teams from Hubei province were given a day off to rest and wait for their transfer.
3月13日，江西医疗队组团去武昌江滩放风。
March 13, Jiangxi Medical Team organized a delegation to Wuchang Jiangtan Feng.
医疗队队员把杨义明他们三个人簇拥在中间，拍照留念。
The members of the medical team gathered Yang Yiming in the middle for a photo shoot.
“他们说想‘看看武汉的样子’，现在正是樱花开的时候，我带他们来看看，这座被守护了这么久的城市，本来该有的美好。
"They said they wanted to 'see what Wuhan looks like,' and now it's time for the cherry blossoms, and I took them to see how beautiful this long-guarded city could have been.
”为了满足医护人员们提出来的“小心愿”，他与同伴们在江滩边上，静候着不远处医护人员们赏景归来。
"To meet the wishes of his staff, he and his colleagues waited at the beach for paramedics to return from nearby.
安全送走医疗队，接下来的任务就是把治愈的人送回家杨义明载着医护人员往返在武汉街头的时候，班超作为首汽约车武汉分区的城市经理，也已经支援“战疫”工作57天了。
When the medical team was safely dispatched, the next task was to send the cured man home. While Yang Yiming was taking his paramedics to and from the Wuhan city streets, Mr. Banchao, the city manager of the Wuhan branch of the first bus company, had been supporting the epidemic for 57 days.
1月24日晚上十点，正在和家人吃年夜饭的他，收到了来自武汉市客运汽车出租管理处和首汽约车领导的电话，不同的人诉说着同一个任务——紧急召集首汽约车的驾驶员，组建志愿者车队，保障武汉市民的日常出行需求。
At 10 pm on January 24, while he was eating dinner with his family, he received a telephone call from the Wuhan Taxi Administration of Passenger Cars and the head of the First Automobile. Different people said the same taskurgently to assemble the drivers of the cars and set up a motorcade of volunteers to guarantee the daily travel needs of the citizens of Wuhan.
挂掉电话的下一秒，班超就马不停蹄地忙碌起来，组建管理团队，分头招募驾驶员志愿者、寻找防疫物资、对接社区。
The next second to hang up the phone, Banchao kept busy, forming a management team to recruit drivers volunteers, find epidemic prevention materials and dock the community.
大年三十的晚上，8个人的小团队熬夜对接调配，仅用了8个小时，就招募到502名驾驶员。
New Year's Eve, eight people's small team stay up late docking deployment, only to use 8 hours, recruitment 502 drivers.
为社区居民运送的团购菜 图源首汽驾驶员弓勇风25号早上，第一批首汽约车志愿者紧急培训后立刻投入了工作，然而，这场战“疫”才刚刚开始。
First batch of SAIC volunteers went to work immediately after emergency training on the morning of July 25, but the battle has only just begun.
保障居民的正常生活，守护他们的健康，是首汽约车和驾驶员们主动扛起的一份责任。
To protect the residents' normal life and protect their health is the responsibility of the first bus and drivers.
班超常常听到驾驶员“买的生活用品堆满了后备箱和后排座椅”、“背着近百岁的老人上下楼、去医院就诊”，或者“产妇突然在车上发作，最后送到医院顺利生产”的事情。
Bracow often hears drivers "buy things full of trunk and back seats," "go downstairs and go to the hospital with nearly a hundred-year-olds on their backs," or "the woman suddenly has a fit in the car and ends up in a hospital."
司机慢慢适应了这样的工作节奏，又接到了新任务——承接武汉市所有外地援汉医疗队的出行保障，以及6家医院治愈患者的出院接送工作。
Drivers slowly adapted to the pace of work, and received a new task - to take over Wuhan City all the overseas medical teams to travel, as well as six hospitals cured patients from the hospital to transport the work.
在江夏第一人民医院接康复病患出院“听说是因为我们在前期防疫工作做的好，上边才又给了我们新工作。
The patient was discharged from the First People's Hospital of Jiangxia. I heard that we did a good job in the early stage of epidemic prevention.
虽然累，但是挺光荣的。
Tired as it is, it is glorious.
”据班超介绍，有了前面的经验，这次不管是招募驾驶员还是筹备物资，进行的都格外顺畅。
"Based on his previous experience, both the recruitment of drivers and the preparation of supplies went smoothly, Benchao said.
不过，有些问题还是难以避免。
However, some problems are unavoidable.
“疫情最重的时候，志愿者每天接触生离死别，各方面压力都很大。
"At the height of the epidemic, volunteers were exposed to life and death on a daily basis, with all aspects of stress high.
”为此，班超在6天时间内跑了200多个社区工作点，对驾驶员进行心理安抚，“有一次和他们聊到家里，彼此都哭了。
To that end, he ran more than 200 community work sites over a six-day period to soothe drivers, "talking to them once and crying to each other.
说实话，看到那些数据和新闻，谁不害怕？自己被感染还好，万一传染给家人怎么办。
To tell the truth, see those data and news, who is not afraid? Their infection is good, in case of infection to their families how to do.
”班超不仅要承担所有人的负面情绪，自己的生活也没能料理好。
Class Chao not only had to take on all the negative emotions, but also failed to take care of his own life.
由于武汉市酒店在疫情期间只接受政府调配，因为工作而无法回家的他“在办公室、车里、政府大楼都住过”，只不过“不敢和家里说，怕他们担心”。
As Wuhan City Hotel only accept government deployment during the outbreak, because work can not go home he "in the office, the car, the government building", but "afraid to talk to their families, afraid they worry.
“做志愿司机这段时间，我吃遍了各种口味的泡面。
"I've been a volunteer driver for a while and I've eaten all kinds of noodles.
”图片来源班超现在回想起来，那段日子大概是最难的时候，“我车上贴了‘志愿者交通运输保障’的标识，停车休息时有人敲窗，把家中最后两盒口罩捐赠给了我。
In retrospect, perhaps the most difficult of those days, "I had a 'volunteer traffic guarantee' sign on my car and someone knocked on the window during the break and donated the last two boxes of masks to me.
”这份来自陌生人的温暖，成了他继续前行的动力。
The warmth of the stranger was what kept him going.
2月底的时候，班超终于被安排住进了酒店，一切都在向好的方向转变，“如今治愈人数多了，人们的出行需求也变多了，我们的工作量越来越大，挺好的。
At the end of February, Banchao was finally admitted to the hotel and everything was changing for the better. "There are more healers and more people have to travel, and our workload is getting bigger and better.
”履行社会责任，彰显榜样力量班超接到任务的那个晚上，首汽约车公司上下也为了全面配合疫情工作而忙碌起来。
On the night of his assignment, FAW was busy trying to keep pace with the epidemic.
1月24日，召集了502名首汽约车驾驶员，为221个社区站点服务；2月10日，在全国44个主要城市设置了200余座固定消毒站，提供消毒服务；2月16日，集结600名首汽约车驾驶员，为所有外地援汉医疗队入驻的145家酒店和6家医院的治愈患者提供出行保障；2月25日，为运营车辆配备了红外体温检测仪和拥有智能感应的紫外线设备，保障复工出行安全…疫情就是命令。
On January 24, 502 CAR drivers were assembled to serve 221 community stations; on February 10, more than 200 stationary disinfection stations were set up in 44 major cities across the country to provide disinfection service.
在过去50多天的时间里，首汽约车不仅从自身业务出发迅速响应，为市民和医护人员提供出行服务，打通救援的生命线，还主动参与到城市战“疫”防控任务中，为守护我们的城市默默贡献着力量，彰显出企业担当和社会责任感。
In the past 50 days, FAW has not only responded quickly from its own business, providing travel services to the public and medical staff, opening up the lifeline of rescue, but also actively participated in the urban warfare "epidemic" control tasks, quietly contributing to the protection of our city, showing corporate responsibility and social responsibility.
首汽约车的司机们正在待命一直以来，首汽约车始终以服务社会、回馈社会为使命。
SAIC's drivers are on standby all along, and SAIC's mission is to serve the community and give back to the community.
在这个平台上，从管理层到驾驶员师傅们，大家都坚信只有为社会创造价值，才是一家受大众喜爱的企业，而企业也会因这种向善的力量而得到更长远的发展。
On this platform, from management to drivers, everyone is convinced that only by creating value for society is a popular enterprise, and that companies will grow in the long run as a result of this force for good.
与责任同行，面对这次的疫情大考，首汽约车就像是一个散发微光的聚力平台，用实际行动和影响力带动和汇聚了更多人加入支援行动，诠释着新时代城市榜样的力量。
With the responsibility of peers, in the face of this epidemic, SAIC is like a cohesive platform, with practical actions and influence to attract and gather more people to join the support action, interpretation of the power of urban role models in the new era.
在采访中，首汽约车的司机们也反复提到，疫情的到来或许改变了他们的工作内容，增加了他们的工作强度，但没有变的，是那份责任初心和对于城市的爱，“让这座城市好起来，一切付出都是值得的。
In interviews with SAIC drivers, it was repeated that the arrival of the epidemic might have changed the content and intensity of their work, but what had not changed was the new sense of responsibility and love for the city.
”如果说那些逆行的医护人员将这座城市慢慢治愈，那首汽约车和驾驶员们，就在用自己的方式，守护和见证着这座城市不断前行。
If the retrograde health-care workers heal the city, the cars and drivers, in their own way, watch and witness the city's progress.
相信这些源源不断的善意，一定可以让我们的城市变得更加美好。
I believe that the continuous good will will make our city a better place.
