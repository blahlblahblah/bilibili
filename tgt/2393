Play每天一条独家原创视频大年初一，首批驰援湖北的医疗队之一湖南株洲市中心医院的15人医疗队抵达黄冈。
One of the first medical teams to reach Huanggang was a 15-member medical team from Zhuzhou City Central Hospital in Hunan Province.
发现状况令人崩溃：黄冈当地医护人员天天连轴转，已经支撑不下去，防控不到位，医护人员陆续被感染，床位紧张，住不进救治点的病人和家属大哭，防护物资和生活物资都奇缺……株洲市中心医院医疗队部分队员医疗队在黄冈龙王山救治点株洲市中心医院医疗队先是接手了3个条件艰苦的临时救治点，1月30号，入驻黄冈“小汤山”——大别山区域医疗中心，和其他医疗队同事一起负责了58张床位，三周里照顾20多位病人出院。
The medical staff in Huanggang has been unable to support the daily rotation, control is not in place, hospital staff have been infected, beds tight, the patients and families living in the center crying, protective materials and supplies are extremely short of medical team in Huanggang Longwangshan Treatment Point Zhuzhou City Central Hospital Medical Team took charge of 58 beds with other medical team colleagues.
15人的医疗队，护理组一半以上是男护士，一个月来，实现了全员“零感染”。
The 15-member medical team, more than half of which are male nurses, has achieved full "zero infection" over the past month.
黄冈本来是武汉之外疫情的第二重灾区，截至2月25日7时，黄冈新冠肺炎患者治愈出院累计达1659人，占确诊病例总量57.12%。
As of 0700 hours on February 25, 1,659 people had been cured and discharged from the new crown pneumonia in Huanggang, accounting for 57.12 percent of the total number of confirmed cases.
株洲市中心医院医疗队主管护师付艳萍主管护师付艳萍会在工作之余，用手机拍下同事们的日常视频传回株洲，一条电话采访了付艳萍，并得到授权发布她拍摄的视频。
Zhuzhou City Central Hospital Medical Team Supervisor pay Yanping supervisor pay Yanping to take photos of colleagues' daily video back to Zhuzhou using her mobile phone after work, a phone interview with pay Yanping, and was authorized to release her video.
“在疾病面前，我们常感到有心无力，但在病人面前，我们就是力量源泉。
"We often feel powerless in the face of illness, but in front of the sick, we are the source of strength.
”自述付艳萍  编辑倪蒹葭护士王嘉铭照顾危重病人，给昏迷病人进行肠道营养我们的主战场是黄冈“小汤山”——大别山区域医疗中心，有一千张床位，收治黄冈市大部分确诊和危重病人。
Our main battleground is the Huanggang "Xiaotangshan" - Dabie Mountain Regional Medical Center, with 1,000 beds, to treat most of the diagnosed and critically ill people in Huanggang.
湖南株洲分队负责58张床位，现在只有40多位病人，已经出院了20多个，每天每个病区都是以个位数在进病人。
The Zhuzhou contingent in Hunan Province, which has 58 beds, has just over 40 patients and has discharged more than 20.
目前治疗的重点是重症病人，我们把重症病人集中放在一个监护室，他们通常是昏迷、气管切开，如果把轻症病人和他们放在一起，轻症也会被感染加重。
The current focus of treatment is on critically ill patients, who are concentrated in a care unit, usually unconscious and tracheotomy, and who, if put together with light patients, are also more likely to become infected.
专科和危重症的专家也都集中起来，负责重症监护室，降低死亡率，把愈后对身体的伤害降到最低。
Specialists and critically ill specialists have also been assembled to take charge of intensive care units to reduce mortality and minimize physical damage.
因为没有特效药，所以是对症治疗，配合传统中医和提高自身免疫力的药物。
Because there is no specific drug, it is symptomatic treatment, traditional Chinese medicine and improve their immunity to drugs.
多是本身就有基础性疾病，才会发展到危重。
Most of them have their own basic diseases, will develop into a serious crisis.
病毒的毒性正在减弱，新进来的病人以轻症为主，重症病人多是早期留下的。
Virus toxicity is weakening, the new patients to light disease mainly, serious patients are left behind in the early days.
教病人做呼吸操面对轻症病人，现在我们开始做呼吸康复操和叙事护理。
To teach patients breathing exercises in the face of mild illness, we now begin to do respiratory rehabilitation exercises and narrative care.
之前也想做，但真的没有时间，本来都延迟了下班，结束工作时已支持不住，现在可以利用下班时间来做。
I wanted to do it before, but I really didn't have time. I had to put off work. I couldn't support myself when I finished my work.
呼吸操，是2018年王辰院士开始推广，可以提高肺功能，在临床，尤其对慢阻肺和长期慢性呼吸系统疾病的病人有很大的益处，缩短了他们的治疗周期。
Breathing exercises, which began to be promoted by academician Wang Chen in 2018, can improve lung function and significantly benefit patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic respiratory disease in clinical settings, shortening their treatment cycle.
2月17号一大早，经过医疗队的详细检查和评估，很多患者都适合做呼吸操。
Early in the morning of February 17, after a detailed examination and evaluation by the medical team, many patients were fit for breathing exercises.
他们非常高兴。
They are very happy.
可以下床活动的患者都加入到我们，我们鼓励患者每天至少花三分钟做。
Patients who can get out of bed join us, and we encourage them to do it for at least three minutes a day.
叙事护理就是描述一件事，让病人把疾病的经过、心里的委屈都倾诉出来，帮他们解除心结。
Narrative care is to describe a thing, so that the patient will be the disease, the grievance of the heart to talk out, to help them ease the knot.
比如他觉得自己今天状态好像差了些，我们就用医学知识告诉他，病的发展就是这样的过程，也听他们讲讲自己的故事。
For example, he felt like he was in a worse shape today, so we used our medical knowledge to tell him that this is how things are going and to tell them their stories.
病人长期在隔离病房，看不到家人朋友，心里特别容易焦虑烦躁，我们教他们呼吸操和做叙事护理，也能让他们觉得不孤独。
Patients in isolation ward for a long time, no family and friends, especially anxious and irritable, we teach them breathing exercises and narrative care, can also make them feel not lonely.
两位护士在交接班我们通常早上6点半起床，有班车从酒店到医院， 7点半准时出发，每次和接送的志愿者、酒店人员目光交流，都能感觉到满满的善意。
We usually get up at 6: 30 in the morning, there is a bus from the hotel to the hospital, 7: 30 on time to leave, and every time and pick up volunteers, hotel staff eye contact, can feel full of goodwill.
早上8点钟交接班，一个班约8小时，有早、中、晚三班。
The shift starts at 8 a. m. with a shift of about 8 hours and three shifts in the morning, middle and evening.
我们四小时轮换一次，4小时在病房里面，4小时在外围工作，因为在病房要穿着严密的防护服，不吃不喝不上厕所，4小时基本上汗水就浸透了，医护如果觉得憋不住尿，就会穿上尿不湿，一天下来只用一套防护服。
We rotate every four hours, four hours in the ward and four hours on the outside because we have to wear tight protective clothing, do not eat or drink toilet, basically soaked in sweat in four hours, medical care if feel suffocated, will wear urine, only a suit of protective clothing at the end of the day.
在临时救治点工作工作逐渐步入正轨，刚开始我们每个人都在崩溃边缘。
Working at the temporary treatment sites is getting back on track, and at first each of us was on the verge of collapse.
因为我们是第一批援助湖北医疗队，大年初一晚上11点到了黄冈，接手过3个临时救治点。
Because we are the first to assist Hubei medical team, New Year's Day at 11: 00 pm to Huanggang, took over three temporary treatment points.
救治点病床有限，病人哭，住不进医院的人也在地上哭，医护跟着哭，哭完继续上班。
The number of hospital beds was limited, the patients cried, and those who could not go to the hospital wept, and the medical staff wept and went on with their work.
印象很深的是，有一对夫妻都染病，但只有丈夫住进来了，他非常急躁，我们就用了不符合医学规定的方法，让妻子跟丈夫共用一张床，也办了住院，他们非常感激。
Impressed by the fact that both husband and wife were ill, but only her husband came in, he was very impatient, and we used the non-medical method of sharing a bed with her husband and getting hospitalized.
医护已经形成习惯，把自己例餐里的水果攒下来，给病人吃物资一直是紧张，但没有刚开始那么恐怖，大年初一过来的时候，任何东西都很紧缺，卫生纸垃圾袋没有，女病人的卫生巾也没有，我们把自己带来的和酒店应急的都拿去，有什么我们都是跟病人共享。
Health care has formed the habit of saving fruit from their meals, feeding patients has been tense, but not so terrible at the beginning of the New Year, when everything is in short supply, toilet paper trash bags, no sanitary towels for women patients, we bring ourselves and hotel emergency supplies, what we share with patients.
到了现在，全国的捐赠有很多，生活用品没有问题了。
By now, there are many donations all over the country, and there are no problems with the daily necessities.
防护物资还是紧缺，因为捐赠的很多达不到标准，所以还是限量领取，今天领明天的。
There is still a shortage of protective materials, as many of the donations do not meet the standards, so limited collection, today to tomorrow's.
大别山区域医疗中心外，每天有物资送来大别山区域医疗中心医护在领取物资，不少空间还是工地状态2月2号护理组全员从临时救治点转战大别山医疗中心，医疗中心原本是5、6月份才启用，如今工人师傅加班加点赶出来交付使用，病区的物品有成千上百种，我们只有几间空空的房间，所有物品堆放在地上，每天要花大量时间找东西。
In addition to the Dabie Mountain Regional Medical Center, daily supplies are delivered to the Dabie Mountain Regional Medical Center for medical care. Much of the space is still available. February 2 Nursing Group 2 moved from the temporary treatment site to the Dabie Mountain Medical Center.
隔离病区发现没有了注射器，就用呼叫仪，让护士站送去，但很快又发现没有另一样东西，传递的次数越多，医护感染的风险越大，效率也低。
When no syringe was found in the quarantined area, the caller was used to take it to the nurse's station, but it was quickly discovered that there was nothing else. The more times the syringe was delivered, the greater the risk of infection and the lower the efficiency.
我们当时就下定决心加班，把所有的物品分成两类，隔离病房（污染区）使用和办公区（清洁区）使用。
We decided to work overtime, divide everything into two categories, the isolation ward (contaminated area) and the office area (cleaning area).
在隔离病房设立储备间，我们称为“2级库房”，免去了一趟趟传递的交叉感染风险。
The establishment of a reserve room in the isolation ward, known as the "level 2 warehouse," eliminates the risk of cross-infection during a trip.
也设立了大输液库房、清洁物品库房和办公用品库房。
There are also large infusion warehouses, clean-up warehouses and office supplies warehouses.
每天治疗工作的排班已经是满负荷了，我们是利用自己的休息时间来科室整理物品，其他医疗队也有人劝我们，在这里上不了多久的班，搞这么认真仔细干什么？还不如用这个时间休息一下。
The daily schedule of treatment is already full, we use our own rest time to organize our supplies, other medical teams have advised us to work here for a short time, to do so carefully? Better take this time off.
但整理做好之后，大家发现工作起来省时省力，顺畅了很多。
But after finishing up, we found that the work to save time and effort, smoothed a lot.
护士李锐从隔离病房出来，脱下防护服，身上已经湿透疫情时期，根本请不到护工、保洁，以前由他们负责的卫生和生活琐碎，现在要全部由医护承担。
Nurse Li Rui came out of the isolation ward, took off his protective clothing, was soaked through the epidemic, and had no nurses, cleaning staff or cleaning staff.
一个班下来，护士除了常规的治疗护理，平均要给病人打20瓶开水，要每间病房搞卫生，清理垃圾，要帮病人解决充电器、卫生纸等各种生活问题，以前在普通病房一个人能完成的事，现在要3倍的时间才能完成。
In addition to routine treatment and nursing, nurses fill an average of 20 bottles of boiling water, clean up each ward, and help patients with a variety of life problems, such as chargers and toilet paper. What could have been done in an ordinary ward now takes three times as long.
穿着厚重防护服，每人每天的微信步数都是2万步以上。
Wear heavy protective clothing, the number of microsteps per person per day is more than 20,000 steps.
院感集中培训了一次穿防护服我们也是第一次面对这种疾病，每天都在学习。
It's the first time we've ever faced this disease. We're learning it every day.
很多人都没有穿防护服的经验。
Many people don't have the experience of wearing protective clothing.
因为国家的甲类传染病才会用防护服，乙类都很少用到，这次是乙类传染病，甲类管理。
Because the country's Class A infectious diseases will use protective clothing, class B is rarely used, this time B infectious diseases, category A management.
平时在医院，手术衣戴个N95口罩，已经是严格防护了。
Normally in the hospital, the operation is wearing a N95 mask, has been a strict protection.
到达黄冈当晚，跟队的院感老师彭丽华集中培训了我们一次，脱防护服时，必须从里往外卷，整个过程不能碰到头部、脸部或衣服，脱完以后，防护服也要很细心地从里往外卷，要把所有的病毒都卷在里面。
On arrival in Huanggang, the team's sensuous teacher, Peng Lihua, focused on training us once. When taking off the protective clothing, we had to roll it from inside to outside and not touch the head, face or clothes.
穿上整套衣服要10多分钟，脱下得花20多分钟。
It takes more than 10 minutes to put on the whole suit and more than 20 minutes to take off.
为了防止感染，我们都有自己单独的房间，之后院感老师就一个房间一个房间过，确保每一个人都学会了。
To prevent infection, we all have our own separate rooms, after which the sensuous teacher passes from room to room, making sure everyone learns.
49岁的株洲市中心医院护理领队朱娟玲都是最后一个下班，因为要核对每班的诊疗单，做好记录这么多不认识的、不同科室的人一起协作也是第一次，医生都是各个科室的主任、副主任，但大家会抛开头衔，为了新环境去协调。
Zhu Juanling, the 49-year-old head nurse at Zhuzhou Central Hospital, was the last to leave work because it was the first time to check the list and record so many people from different sections working together.
株洲地区来了6个医院，99%都不认识，而且大家都穿着防护，更加难认。
There are six hospitals in Zhuzhou, 99% of which do not know each other, and they are all wearing protective clothing, which is even more difficult to recognize.
我们就把值班医生的名字电话都写在黑板上，在微信群里交接班，通常是第二天交班的时候，才反应过来，你就是群里的某某。
We wrote down the names and phone numbers of the doctors on duty on the blackboard, handed them over from group to group, usually the next day when we turned in the shift.
我们开玩笑说，虽然同事这么久，是抗疫的战友，但是等疫情过去，见面还是不会认识。
We joked that even though our colleagues had been fighting the disease for so long, they would not know each other until the outbreak was over.
每天都需要学习，我们医疗队的谭英征副主任是感染科的专家，也是我们病区的总住院，他每天会看最新的文献和医学动态，发在群里，然后我们再针对每个病人不同情况来讨论。
We need to study every day. Deputy Director Tan Yingzheng of our medical team is an expert in infection department and the general inpatient in our ward. He reads the latest literature and medical developments every day, sends them to the group, and then we discuss them according to each patient's different situation.
院感彭丽华，负责全队感染防控我们株洲市中心医院15人的医疗队是零感染，有一位跟队的院感老师彭丽华，主管防控这块。
Hospital sense Peng Lihua, in charge of the prevention and control of infection in our Zhuzhou central hospital 15-member medical team is zero infection, there is a team of hospital teachers Peng Lihua, in charge of prevention and control of this.
“院感”意思就是医院内感染，这是压力非常大的一块。
"Hospital Feeling" means an infection in the hospital, which is a very stressful area.
很多病人其实是在医院内部感染加重的，医护人员也是在救助过程中感染上的，怎么降低这个感染率，就是院感老师的任务。
Many patients are in fact in the hospital infection increased, the medical staff is also in the process of infection, how to reduce this infection rate, is the hospital sensuous teacher's task.
医疗队在龙王山救治点合影大年初一到达黄冈之后，我们接手了几个救治点，当地的医护觉得我们比较“奇怪”，也比较严格。
After the medical team arrived in Huanggang on the first day of the Lunar New Year, we took over several treatment points, local medical care felt that we were more "strange" and strict.
第一个班，是在龙王山救治点，一家老年公寓临时改造而成，输液架都不全，直接在墙上钉了钉子挂吊瓶。
The first class, in Longwangshan treatment point, a temporary transformation of an elderly apartment, the infusion rack is incomplete, directly on the wall nail hanging bottle.
当地医务人员已经在陆续收诊病人，但防控做得还不够，院感彭丽华拿到当地医院的布局图，重新规划、区分污染区和清洁区，进行医院布局的施工改造。
Local medical staff have been receiving patients, but the control is not enough, hospital Peng Lihua to get the layout of the local hospital, re-plan, distinguish between contaminated areas and clean areas, and carry out the layout of the hospital.
1月29日，办公室接到电话，救治点的一位本地医生确诊感染，他是最早接触患者的医生，接完电话，几个医生沉默良久。
On 29 January, the office received a telephone call confirming the infection from a local doctor at the treatment site, the first doctor to contact the patient, who answered the phone and several doctors remained silent for a long time.
我们当时心里特别不舒服，哭了好几次，同行之间的感触吧，他太辛苦了，工作时间太长，因为没有人顶替他；我们是第一批到达黄冈的医疗队，好多当地医生看到我们真的是眼泪都流下来了，因为已经支撑不下去了。
He worked too hard and worked too long hours because there was no one to take his place. We were the first medical team to arrive in Huanggang, and many local doctors saw that we were in tears because they couldn't hold on.
医护用手机和写字交流年初五，院感接到任务，去大别山区域医疗中心进行防控指导，湖南第一批援鄂医疗队是负责该医院5楼整层楼，医院布局是合理的，有医务通道和病人通道，在办公区和病区之间有三个缓冲间，我们将其归为潜在污染1区、潜在污染2区以及缓冲区，医护人员怎么进出入病房，护士怎么配药送药接药，怎么穿脱防护服，以及哪个区域要备哪些物品，院感都仔细给出流程，物品一一罗列，生怕少了哪个环节。
The first batch of medical teams in Hunan was responsible for the whole building on the 5th floor of the hospital. The first medical teams in Hunan were in charge of the whole building on the 5th floor of the hospital.
护士站（清洁区）已经用玻璃封住，和隔离病区的医护即使面对面，也听不见对方讲话，交流需要用手机或者写在纸上，贴着玻璃给对方看。
Nurse stations (cleaning areas) have been glass-sealed, and medical care in isolated areas cannot hear each other even face-to-face. Communication requires using a cell phone or writing it on paper and taping it to the other person.
院感从当地医院后勤人员那里了解到，医院是集中中央空调通风，病区和办公区共用一个机组，这样很可能会将病人呼出的病毒通过空调带入办公区。
The hospital staff learned from local hospital staff that the hospital is centralized ventilation, the sick area and the office area share a unit, which is likely to bring the patient's exhaled virus through the air conditioning into the office area.
所以马上告诉后勤人员一定不要开办公区的空调，保证病房的空调，办公区用电炉烤火。
So tell the logistician immediately must not open the air-conditioning of the office area, ensure the air-conditioning of the ward, office area with electric fire.
年初六晚上，收治病人之前，再次告知黄冈当地护士空气物表及地面采用什么消毒，以及消毒剂的浓度配比。
On the night of June 6, 2006, before accepting the patients, the local nurses in Huanggang were again told what air table and ground disinfection, as well as the concentration ratio of disinfectant.
等一切准备就绪，病人通宵陆续入住，所有医护穿戴防护服后互相检查，或是经过院感检查，确认合格才能进入病房。
When everything is ready, patients are admitted overnight, all health care personnel wear protective clothing to each other, or after a hospital check-up, confirmed qualified to enter the ward.
大别山区域医疗中心，院感彭丽华承担了卫生员工作疫情时期，根本请不到卫生员，院感老师主动承担起卫生员的工作，每天打扫厕所，拖地喷洒，配制消毒液，医疗队还开玩笑说这么高级的卫生员，肯定能保证医护人员零感染。
Dabie Mountain Regional Medical Center, hospital sense Peng Lihua took on the work of health workers epidemic period, hospital sensuous teachers took the initiative to take on the role of sanitary workers, daily cleaning toilets, dust sprays, preparation of disinfectant, and the medical team joked that such a high-level health care personnel, sure to ensure zero infection.
下班的路上，护理领队朱娟玲和护士王嘉铭，累得说不出话在大别山区域医疗中心，刚参与了基础的布局，因为南湖救治点条件比较艰苦，我们分了一部人去南湖。
On the way home from work, nursing team leader Zhu Juanling and nurse Wang Jiaming were too tired to speak at the Dabie Mountain Regional Medical Center.
护理领队朱娟玲说，我们是株洲地区最大的医院，所以我们去最艰苦的地方。
'We are the biggest hospital in Zhuzhou, so we went to the hardest places, 'said Zhu Juanling, a nursing team leader.
南湖医院由福利院临时改造，可收治120人，距离大别山区域医疗中心只有几分钟车程，主要是收治发热的、已做核酸检测等待结果的病人，结果阳性的转至大别山。
The South Lake Hospital, which is temporarily renovated by the Welfare Home and can accommodate 120 people, is only a few minutes' drive from the Dabie Mountain Regional Medical Center.
到南湖医院门口时，也是让院感老师最先进去。
At the entrance to the South Lake Hospital, the hospital was the first to let the sensuous teacher in.
院感像是排雷兵，地雷排了，安全了，后面的人再出来抗战。
The yard feels like a minesweeper. The mines are in line. It's safe. Those behind us will come out again.
当时已经有病人陆续进来，但医护通道和病人通道是共用的，而且一个院感人员也没有。
Patients were already coming in, but the access roads and patient passages were shared, and there was no hospital staff.
我们也只能依靠福利院原有的条件分区、建通道、优化流程，每层楼争取到配一瓶快速水消。
We can only rely on the welfare institutions original conditions zoning, construction channels, optimization process, each floor to win a bottle of fast water dissipation.
队员在酒店互相剪发医生梁彦超剪发后在开始工作前，院感就制定了我们怎么回房间的流程，我们所有人穿冲锋衣，方便用酒精擦拭，酒店房间外面放置了两个柜子，从外面回来，最外层衣服放在第1个污染区（柜子），用酒精喷洒，包括鞋子、鞋底这些都要喷；毛衣这一层就放在第2个柜子。
Before starting work, the team members decided how we should go back to the room. We all wore a blazer and easily cleaned it with alcohol. Two cabinets were placed outside the hotel room and returned from the outside. The outermost garment was sprayed with alcohol, including shoes and soles.
脱完毛衣，手消毒，开门后再快速手消，把包挂好，用消毒纸巾擦拭门把手，再去洗澡、洗头，必须要洗半小时以上。
Take off your sweater, disinfect your hands, open the door, hang up your bag, wipe the doorknob with a disinfectant paper towel, then wash and shampoo, must wash more than half an hour.
房间卫生我们都是自己搞，因为酒店人员也是志愿者，尽量减轻他们的负担。
We all do our own cleaning because hotel staff are volunteers, trying to lighten their burden.
为了防止感染，医疗队无论男女，在宾馆自学成才，互相剪头，虽身处疫区，但剪发气氛轻松，有人修改梁咏琪歌词唱道：我已剪短我的发，看你病毒怎么发。
To prevent infection, both men and women in the medical team in the hotel self-taught, cut each other's hair, although in the affected areas, but the atmosphere is relaxed, someone modified Liang Yongqi lyrics singing: I have cut my hair, to see how you virus hair.
女医生梁彦超和家中孩子视频，1岁多的宝宝不认识短发的她了，叫她阿姨。
Female doctor Liang Yan Chao and home child video, 1 year old baby does not know her short hair, call her aunt.
我们队友之间尽量是电话和微信联系，避免接触。
Try to keep in touch with each other by phone and microphone.
都是在自己的房间里单独吃饭。
They all eat alone in their own rooms.
平时工作，也保持两两检查防护服之后，再进入隔离病区的习惯，进去之后，也会不定时看对方的衣服。
Usually work, but also keep two or two check protective clothing, then into the quarantine area of the habit, after entering, will also look at each other's clothes.
株洲市中心医院给每个人准备了几箱物资出发时，株洲市中心医院就给我们每个人准备了几箱物资，大到衣服、药品、营养品、防护用品，小到热水袋、脸盆、护手霜、指甲剪等等一应俱全，简直是搬家式援助。
When Zhuzhou Central Hospital prepared several boxes of supplies for everyone to leave, Zhuzhou Central Hospital prepared several boxes of materials for each of us, ranging from clothing, medicine, nutrition, protective supplies to hot water bags, washbasins, hand cream, nail clips, etc., all of which amounted to moving aid.
之后又寄来两批物资，有蛋白粉、胸腺肽，增强免疫力。
Then sent two more shipments, protein powder, thymomin, enhance immunity.
近一个月背井离乡的工作，湖南医疗队很多队友身体出现了各种各样的问题，了解到他们的需求后，我们会第一时间带着药品和设备赶到现场援助，后来大家形成习惯，一有问题就找株洲市中心医院的队友，他们那里什么都有，因为大后方给我们准备得很充分。
Many of our teammates from Hunan Medical Team have had all kinds of physical problems in the past month. Knowing their needs, we will bring medicine and equipment to the scene to help them.
五大男护士我们团队是一个特例，一般出来援助的医疗队，女护士占了90%以上，但我们医疗队9个护士，5个是男护士。
Five Men Nurses Our team is a special case, generally come out to assist the medical team, female nurses account for more than 90%, but our medical team of nine nurses, five of them male nurses.
我们医院男护士在湖南省也是数量最多的，派这5位男护士来，是因为他们都从事过重症医学，郭希是重症医院副护士长，王嘉铭是重症医学的专科护士，还有两位来自手术室的护士，以前也轮训过重症医学，最小的男护士欧飞宇，94年出生，他在120院前急救中心工作，以前是重症医学科的，所以他们都有这方面的工作能力。
The five male nurses from our hospital are also the most numerous in Hunan Province because they are all in intensive care, Guo is the deputy head nurse of the intensive care hospital, Wang Jiaming is a specialist nurse in intensive care, and two nurses from the operating room have also been trained in intensive care.
手术室护士李锐，大年初一接到医院通知下午就出发，放下电话，他立刻带着宝宝和妻子下楼买了烟花，度过最后的过年时光医院觉得我们大老远出来，背井离乡，所以也多选择了一些男孩子，体力耐力要更好一些。
The operating room nurse Li Rui, received the hospital notice on the afternoon to leave, put down the telephone, he immediately took the baby and his wife downstairs to buy fireworks, spent the last New Year's time hospital think we have come a long way from home, so also chose some more boys, physical endurance better.
男护士是一个弱势群体，我之前带过一个护士，他交的女朋友家里不同意，就因为他是一个男护士，但这次他们起到了至关重要的作用。
The male nurse is a vulnerable group, I brought a nurse before, his girlfriend did not agree, because he is a male nurse, but this time they played a vital role.
郭希护理重症病人，诊疗单子非常长ICU的郭希和王嘉铭，有重症监护室的丰富经验，义不容辞地承担起危重病人的护理，帮他们翻身，经常要做一些感染危险高的气道护理等操作。
With their extensive experience in intensive care units, Guo Xi and Wang Jiaming are obliged to take care of critically ill patients and help them turn over. They often have to take care of the airway with high risk of infection.
护理一个气管切开的病人，风险非常高，痰液会溅到身上，他们每天为危重病人吸痰、测量生命体征，观察气道和吸氧情况，治疗非常繁重。
The risk of nursing a patient with a tracheotomy is very high, and the sputum spills onto the body. Each day, they suck sputum, measure vital signs, observe the airway and oxygen uptake in critically ill patients.
上完夜班之后，白天就不用上班，但他们会主动过来搞卫生。
After the night shift, they don't have to work during the day, but they come to do it voluntarily.
护士李锐护士李锐是手术室神经外科专科组长，他是情商很高特别会表达的男孩子，上班时间紧任务重，他加了病人微信，用休息时间给病人介绍病情，做健康宣教和心理护理，甚至之前南湖医院的病人，核酸检测阴性后还给他发信息告诉他结果，感谢他的鼓励。
Nurse Li Rui, a specialist in neurosurgery in the operating room, is a boy with high emotional intelligence and a heavy workload. He adds patient micro-letters, takes breaks to brief patients on his illness, conducts health education and psychological care, and even sends him messages telling him the results after negative nucleic acid tests, thanking him for his encouragement.
“根据马斯洛需求的定义，很多隔离的患者不只是需要食物和治疗，也需要交流沟通。
"According to Maslow's definition of need, many isolated patients need not only food and treatment, but also communication.
所以我工作的时候，也会对他们进行人文护理——交心！”李锐说。
So when I work, I will also give them humanistic care, "Li said."
南湖医院一位82岁李奶奶，因为住院仓促，把手机遗忘在家中，又记不住儿子的电话，情绪非常激动，天天闹着要出院。
South Lake Hospital, an 82-year-old grandmother, because of rushed hospitalization, left his mobile phone at home, and can not remember his son's phone, emotional, every day to leave the hospital.
李锐知道，李奶奶是对陌生的环境感到孤独无助，于是他一有时间就去和老奶奶聊天，她有两个儿子，大儿子在黄冈，在浙江当教授的小儿子更是她这辈子最大的骄傲，这次作为疑似新冠肺炎患者隔离治疗好几天了，又联系不上家人，才闹着要出院。
Li Rui knew that Grandma Li was lonely and helpless in a strange environment, so he went to chat with her whenever he could. She had two sons, the eldest son in Huanggang, and the youngest son, a professor in Zhejiang Province, was the pride of her life.
李锐每天去跟她聊天，她不再闹着要出院，开始配合医护的治疗。
Li Rui went to talk to her every day. She stopped fussing about getting out of the hospital and began to cooperate with medical treatment.
李锐托付接手的管床护士，多关注老奶奶2月2号护理组全员转战大别山，李锐临走前特意交代接手的管床护士要多多关注老奶奶，尽早帮她和家人取得联系。
Li Rui entrusted to take over the tube bed nurse, more attention to the grandmother February 2 nursing team transferred to Dabie Mountain, Li Rui left specifically to take care of the nurse to take care of the grandmother, as early as possible to help her contact her family.
来到大别山后，李锐要负责30位患者的护理，仍时常询问南湖医院护理过病患的情况。
After arriving at Dabie Mountain, Li Rui was responsible for the care of 30 patients, still often asked Nanhu Hospital care patients.
护士邓建斌在采集咽拭子邓建斌是手术室副护士长，他平时要管手术室100多人的排班，派他来也是因为他的统筹管理经验。
Tang Jianbin, a nurse who collects swabs and swabs Deng Jianbin, is the deputy head nurse in the operating room.
他临行前再三叮嘱妻子：“父母年纪大了，就告诉他们医院临时加班，不回去过年，支援的事就不要提了。
Before he left, he repeatedly exhorted his wife: "When their parents are old, tell them that the hospital will work overtime temporarily.
”在龙王山救治点的第一个班，由于环境不熟悉，物品准备不齐全，乱得让人崩溃，他当晚回到酒店，凭着记忆画出病房布局图，分配区域管理，增设隔离区物资补充站，标配每个治疗车，让流程顺了起来。
The first class at the Dragon King Hill site, overwhelmed with unfamiliar surroundings and ill-prepared supplies, returned to the hotel that evening to map the ward by memory, allocate the area management, add material resupply stations in the area of separation, and standardize each treatment vehicle to make the process go smoothly.
护士邓建斌一上午采集到的咽拭子数量我们同事生病了，人力不够的时候，他一个人管两个人的病人，一天在隔离病房连续工作了10个小时，不吃不喝不上厕所，下班之后我们就问他怎么样，他说还好还好，我们都知道肯定很辛苦，一般在隔离病房只能工作4、5个小时。
Nurse Deng Jianbin collected swabs and swabs this morning When our colleague was sick and the manpower was short, he kept two patients working for 10 hours a day in the isolation ward without food or water, and after work we asked him how he was.
邓建斌还主动承担为病人采咽拭子的工作，采集的时候，病人很容易咳嗽，是职业暴露风险很高的操作，要戴上面罩，达到三级防护。
Deng Jianbin also volunteered to carry out the work of collecting swabs for patients. At the time of collection, patients easily coughed and were exposed to a high risk of occupational exposure.
他一天要进行数十次这样的操作。
He does it dozens of times a day.
这一次，他做的事情相对是最多的。
This time, he did the most.
在株洲后方的同事看来，他到达黄冈后，在医院大群里报了个平安，就消失了。
In Zhuzhou rear colleagues, he arrived in Huanggang, in the hospital group reported a safe, disappeared.
陈娜护师我们4个女护士，也都是有相关背景，比如陈娜护师在钟南山院士团队工作过，她个子特别小，一米五多，防护服穿起来很不合身，行动费力，但也没有因为这个局限而少做事情。
Nurse Chenna Our four female nurses also have relevant backgrounds. For example, Patron Chenna worked for a team of academicians in Zhong Nan Shan. She was very small, more than one meter and five meters.
生理期的时候，女性医护会用尿不湿，卫生巾肯定是不够的，再贴上暖宝宝，这样就还好。
Physiological period, female medical care will not wet urine, sanitary napkin is certainly not enough, and then paste a warm baby, so good.
因为平时在株洲，生理期的时候我也会碰上做纤维支气管，从早上7点半工作到下午一两点，不吃不喝不上厕所，所以这方面已经有准备了。
Because usually in Zhuzhou, physiological period, I will also encounter do fiber bronchial, from 7: 30 a.m. to 1: 00 p.m., do not eat not to drink toilet, so this has been prepared.
大年初一，医疗队从长沙南站出发出来得久了，最大的问题是想家，儿子一年级，特别黏我，每天要辅导作业，爸爸妈妈年纪大了，有高血压和心脏病，大年三十，我告诉爸爸妈妈报名了支援湖北，我妈妈就哭了，说能不去吗？我说这就是我们呼吸科的问题呀。

看了赞扬我们的文章，我其实感觉有点不好意思，因为我们就是做了本职工作。
After reading the article praising us, I felt a little bit embarrassed, because we just did our job.
我唯一期盼的就是大家平安，这场疫情赶快过去，所有的家人团圆。
I only hope that everyone is safe, this epidemic quickly over, all the family reunion.

医疗队做到“零感染”的Tips：1、医院内区分医务通道和病人通道，区分污染区和清洁区，如果是集中中央空调通风，病区和办公区共用一个机组，那一定不要开办公区空调。
In hospitals, separate the medical passageway from the patient passageway, separate the polluted area from the clean area. If the central air-conditioning ventilation is centralized, the sick area and the office area share a single unit, do not open the office area air-conditioning.
2、保证免疫力，可以吃蛋白粉、打胸腺肽。

3、明确下班后回房间的流程，房间外面放置了两个柜子，从外面回来，最外层衣服放在第1个污染区（柜子），用酒精喷洒，包括鞋子、鞋底这些都要喷；毛衣这一层就放在第2个柜子；脱完毛衣，手消毒，开门后再快速手消，把包挂好，用消毒纸巾擦拭门把手。
3. Make sure the procedure for returning to your room after work. Two cabinets are placed outside and the outermost garment is placed in the first contaminated area (cabinet). Spray with alcohol, including shoes and soles.
再去洗澡、洗头，必须要洗半小时以上。
Bathing and shampoo must be done for more than half an hour.
4、队友之间尽量电话和微信联系，单独在自己房间吃饭。
4, team-mates as far as possible telephone and micromail contact, alone in their own room for dinner.
5、进入隔离病区前，两两检查防护服。
Inspect protective clothing two or two days before entering the quarantine area.
进去开始工作后，也不定时看队友防护服是否有问题。
After entering to start work, do not look at the teammate's protective clothing regularly whether there is a problem.
