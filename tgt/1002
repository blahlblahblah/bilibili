从仿制成功到最终带来效益，博瑞医药面临的关卡重重。
From the success of imitation to the ultimate benefits of BORI medicine faces a number of obstacles.
博瑞医药2月12日的成交数据显示，二级市场疯抢筹码，一些机构则趁机抛售。
BORI medical transaction data on February 12 showed that the secondary market crazy chip, some institutions are selling.
而同属瑞德西韦概念股的博腾股份和永太科技，已在多日涨停后连续跌停，走出过山车行情。
Meanwhile, Boateng shares and Wing Tai technology, both of which belong to Rhetsetse concept shares, have continued to limit after a number of days, out of the roller coaster market.
来源：腾讯新闻《潜望》 作者 章北海 何西寄托人们战胜病毒朴素愿望的“神药”瑞德西韦，被科创板上市的博瑞医药（688166.SH）成功仿制，并开始启动批量化生产。
2007-9-25 09: 29: 48 Redeemer, a "miracle drug" for defeating the virus's simple desire, was successfully copied by Founder Group Inc.-listed Berry Medicine (688166.SH) and began mass production.
2月12日，这一消息直接助推博瑞医药开盘即封死涨停，涨幅20.01%，总市值214亿元。
On February 12, the news directly contributed to the start of the closing of BORI Medicine, up 20.01%, with a total market value of 21.4 billion yuan.
不过，与资本市场表现出的亢奋相比，一位美国医学教授对腾讯新闻《潜望》指出，自从美国宣布使用该药物治愈一名患者，以及国内开始实施临床三期试验后，瑞德西韦被寄予厚望。
But, in contrast to the euphoria of the capital markets, an American medical professor told Tencent News's Diving Hope that Rhetsevier had high hopes since the United States announced the use of the drug to cure a patient and a third phase of clinical trials in the country.
但在临床试验结束之前，不能证明瑞德西韦就是特效药。
But Rhetsevir cannot be proven to be a specific drug until clinical trials are completed.
最新的临床试验注册信息显示，瑞德西韦针对新型冠状病毒肺炎重症患者的三期临床试验，由中日友好医院曹彬教授带队的，已经在2月10日入组。
Recent clinical trial registrations show that Rhetsevir's third phase of clinical trials of patients with severe new coronavirus pneumonia, led by Professor Cao Bin, a Sino-Japanese friendly hospital, joined the team on February 10.
重症患者病例人数452人，根据临床试验设计，试验采用随机、双盲、安慰剂对照方法展开。
According to the clinical trial design, the test was carried out by randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled method.
此前消息显示，临床三期试验预期在4月27日结束。
Prior to the news, clinical phase III trials are expected to end on April 27.
在试验结果最终证明瑞德西韦切实有效后，尽管博瑞医药在公告中表示疫情期间将主要通过捐赠等方式供应给相关病人，博瑞医药仍需迈过专利授权门槛。
After the test results proved Rhetsevir to be effective, BORI still had to cross the patent licensing threshold, although BORI said in its bulletin that it would be supplied to patients during the outbreak, mainly through donations.
美国制药公司Gilead作为该药物的专利人，需要对博瑞医药的仿制药进行授权后方可销售。
The US pharmaceutical company Gilead, as the patent owner of the drug, needs to authorize the generic version of BORI before it can be sold.
这也意味着，从仿制成功到最终带来效益，博瑞医药面临的关卡重重。
This also means that from successful imitation to the ultimate benefits of BORI medicine faces a number of hurdles.
博瑞医药2月12日的成交数据显示，二级市场疯抢筹码，一些机构则趁机抛售。
BORI medical transaction data on February 12 showed that the secondary market crazy chip, some institutions are selling.
而同属瑞德西韦概念股的博腾股份和永太科技，已在多日涨停后连续跌停，走出过山车行情。
Meanwhile, Boateng shares and Wing Tai technology, both of which belong to Rhetsetse concept shares, have continued to limit after a number of days, out of the roller coaster market.
“神药”瑞德西韦用于美国首例新冠病毒患者的治疗的瑞德西韦，是由美国生物制药公司Gilead 几年前针对非洲流行的埃博拉病毒所研制的抗病毒药剂。
Rhetsevir, a "miracle drug" used to treat America's first new-crown-virus patient, is an antiviral drug developed a few years ago by the American biopharmaceutical company Gilead against the Ebola epidemic in Africa.
但从临床试验效果来看，实际上瑞德西韦对埃博拉病毒患者的治疗效果并不好，与其他三款针对埃博拉病毒研制的药剂同时进行临床试验时，接受瑞德西韦治疗的埃博拉病毒感染患者的致死率最高。
But, in terms of clinical trials, Rhetsevir did not actually work well with Ebola patients, who had the highest death rates from Rhetsevir-treated Ebola virus-infected patients when clinical trials were conducted simultaneously with three other agents developed for the virus.
在2019年10月由美国国家过敏与传染病研究机构公布的一篇论文中称，总共1400多名接受临床试验的患者被随机分配四种药的治疗，分别是ZMapp、Mab114、REGN-EB3和瑞德西韦，最终，接受ZMapp治疗的患者死亡率为49%，接受mAb114治疗的患者死亡率 为34%，接受REGN-EB3治疗的患者死亡率为29%，而接受瑞德西韦治疗的患者死亡率最高，达到53%，埃博拉病毒爆发的总体死亡率为67%。
According to a paper published in October 2019 by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, more than 1,400 patients in clinical trials were randomly assigned to four treatments: ZMapp, Mab114, REGN-EB3, and Rhetsevir, with a mortality rate of 49%, mAb114 with 29%, Rhetsevir with 53%, and Ebola with 67%.
基于这样的临床试验结果，试验数据和安全监测委员会决定，继续进行死亡率最低的两款药REGN-EB3和mAB114的试验，而解除了另两款药ZMapp和瑞德西韦的继续试验。
Based on the results of such clinical trials, the Test Data and Safety Monitoring Committee decided to continue the trials of the two drugs with the lowest mortality rates, REGN-EB3 and mAB 114, and to release the remaining two, ZMapp and Rhetsevir.
但在新型冠状病毒肆虐之下，一起基于“同情用药”准则下的治愈案例，让沉寂的瑞德西韦成为扼住疫情咽喉的新希望。
But with the new coronavirus raging, a cure based on the principle of "compassionate medication" has turned the silent Rhetsevius into a new hope of choking the epidemic.
很快，中日友好医院宣布其在武汉疫区牵头开展该药物治疗新型冠状病毒的临床研究。
Soon, the Sino-Japanese Friendship Hospital announced that it was leading a clinical study of the drug for the treatment of a new coronavirus in Wuhan.
2月11日，博瑞医药发布公告称，公司已于近日成功仿制开发了瑞德西韦原料药合成工艺技术和制剂技术，并已批量生产出瑞德西韦原料药，瑞德西韦制剂批量化生产正在进行中。
On February 11, the company announced that it had successfully imitated the Rhetsevir process and preparation technology, and had mass-produced the Rhetsevir bulk drug, which is now being mass-produced, the company said on Tuesday.
公司还表示，如果该产品能获批上市，疫情期间将主要通过捐赠等方式供应给相关病人。
The company also said that if the product can be approved to go on the market, the outbreak will be mainly through donations to the patients concerned.
博瑞医药还披露，截至目前，其在瑞德西韦的原料药和制剂开发和生产中已发生的成本预计 约为 500 万元，后续进一步放大生产，预计还需要投入约 1000 万元。
BORI also disclosed that, to date, the costs incurred in the development and production of Rhetsevir APIs and preparations were estimated to be approximately $5 million, with further expansion expected to cost about $10 million.
面临试验结果与授权两大关从仿制成功到最终带来效益，博瑞医药面临的关卡重重。
Facing the test result and the authorization two big barrier from the imitation success to the ultimate benefit, the BORI medicine faces many obstacles.
关卡之一即为瑞德西韦正在进行的临床三期试验。
One of these is the third phase of a clinical trial being carried out by Rhetsevius.
对于临床试验这一过程，浙江大学教授王立铭表示，“瑞德西韦需要严格遵循新药开发的规律，不能随意缩短研究的时间和标准。
In clinical trials, Zhejiang University professor Wang Liming said Rhetsevir needed to follow the strict rules of new drug development and not shorten the time and standard of research at will.
因为“不管疾病有多严重，不管我们期待新药和新疫苗的愿望是多么迫切，新药和新疫苗开发的规律无法被逾越。
For "no matter how serious the disease may be, no matter how urgent our desire for new drugs and vaccines may be, the laws governing the development of new drugs and vaccines cannot be overcome."
”博瑞医药在公告中也对投资者进行了相应的风险提示：1、瑞德西韦由美国 Gilead 公司开发，用于防治埃博拉病毒感染，已经在国外通过了Ⅰ期和Ⅱ期临床试验，目前瑞德西韦用于新型冠状病毒（2019-nCoV）感染的Ⅲ期临床试验并未结束，因此该药物对于新型冠状病毒（2019-nCoV）感染是否有效存在重大不确定性。
In the announcement, BORI also gave investors risk cues: 1. Rhetsevir, developed by the US company Gilead to combat Ebola virus infection, has passed clinical trials I and II abroad, and the third phase of Rhetsevir clinical trial for a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection is not over.
如果相关临床试验结果不理想，则瑞德西韦的仿制技术就无重大价值可言。
If the results of clinical trials are not satisfactory, Rhetsevier's imitation technique has no significant value.
2、如果新型冠状病毒（2019-nCoV）感染造成的疫情短期内迅速获得控制和缓解，确诊病人持续减少，即使瑞德西韦获得注册批准，用于治疗新型冠状病毒（2019-nCoV）感染，预计也不会对抗击本次疫情有重大帮助。
2. If the outbreak of the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection is quickly contained and alleviated in the short term, the number of patients diagnosed will continue to decrease, and even if Rhetsevir is registered for the treatment of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, it is not expected to contribute significantly to the fight against the epidemic.
3、即使瑞德西韦用于新型冠状病毒（2019-nCoV）感染的临床试验成功，公司的前述研发要最终转化为产品投入市场，仍需经过获得专利权人美国Gilead公司授权、药物临床、药品审批等多个环节，这一过程将存在重大不确定性。
Even if Rhetsevir is successful in clinical trials for a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, the company's aforementioned research and development will have to go through several steps, including licensing, drug clinical trials, and drug approval by the patent holder, Gilead USA.
4、公司将对瑞德西韦的仿制研发视为自身所承担的社会责任，若该产品能够获批上市，疫情期间主要通过捐赠等方式供应给相关病人。
The company regards Rhettifov's imitation research and development as its own social responsibility. If the product can be approved to go on the market, it will be supplied to the patients concerned mainly through donation during the epidemic.
因此，从生产成本、定价、销量预期等方面考虑，预计该产品不会对公司2020年的经营业绩产生重大影响。
Therefore, the product is not expected to have a significant impact on the company's business performance in 2020 in terms of production costs, pricing and sales projections.
二级市场疯抢筹码 机构趁机抛售尽管进行了风险提示，但仿制成功的消息已经让二级市场开始疯抢筹码。
The secondary market frantic chip-grabbing institutions took the opportunity to sell despite the risk tips, but the success of the imitation has let the secondary market start to chip crazy.
截止2月12日收盘，科创板上市的博瑞医药股价突破50元达52.12元/股，较上市发行价12.71元，实现了超3倍的涨幅。
By the close of trading on Feb. 12, BORI's shares had soared more than three times to 52.12 yuan a share, compared with the IPO price of 12.71 yuan.
由于公司在11日公告称仿制开发了瑞德西韦原料药合成工艺技术和制剂技术，12日一开盘，股价就被巨量资金死死封在20%的涨停板上。
As the company announced on the 11 th notice that the development of the Rhettifov bulk drug synthesis technology and preparation technology, the opening on the 12, the share price was a huge amount of money locked in 20% trading.
从成交回报可以看出，买入资金占据了主导权。
From the turnover you can see that the purchase of funds dominated.
有意思的是，前五买入的资金较为平均，都在510万到522万之间。
Interestingly, the top five bought on average, between 5.1 million and 5.22 million.
“这意味着没有哪一家在筹码上吃独食，买入力量较为均衡。
"This means that no one on the chip to eat alone, buying power is more balanced.
”一位浙江的游资操盘手认为，这就表示日后的抛盘不会太剧烈。
A Zhejiang hot money handler said this meant the selling would not be too intense.
卖出席位中，卖一席位为西藏东方财富成都东大街营业部，卖出469万元，但该营业部并未出现在2月3日的买入席位中，这就意味着它手握的筹码是在多个交易日里逐步买入而来。
One of the seats sold was a 4.69 million yuan sale from the Dongjie Business Department, an east-wealth property in Tibet, which didn't show up for the February 3 buying session, meaning it had the leverage to buy over several trading days.
卖二席位中，出现了机构专用席位，卖出320万元。
Out of the two seats sold, 3.2 million yuan were sold for institutional seats.
“很有可能是公募或私募的某个产品开始止盈。
"It's very likely that some product, public or private, is starting to end.
”他解释道。
'he explained.
总体而言，前五的买入资金超过前五卖出总计1077万元。
Overall, the top five bought more money than the top five, totaling 10.77 million yuan.
“买入超过卖出太多，不一定利于股价的后续走势。
"Buying more than you sell is not necessarily good for subsequent moves in the stock price.
”因为买入的席位就已是潜在的空头。
Because the seats bought are potentially short.
买入得多，卖出得就必然多。
Buy more and sell more.
“龙虎榜上的资金，都要在短期内止盈或者止损。
"All the money on the tiger list should stop short-term earnings or stop-loss.
”一位投资人更是苦口婆心道，对于仿制成功的消息需要理性看待，好好读读公告再兴奋。
One investor is even more bitter that the message of success needs to be treated rationally and read the announcement carefully before it gets excited.
首先瑞德西韦第三期临床试验还差不多要一个月才能出结果，再者就算是做出仿制药也需要美国吉利德公司授权才能生产卖，最后等临床完了有没有效果两说，新冠肺炎已经不治而愈，没有特效药用于治疗新冠肺炎，最好的药是“免疫力”，所以不要兴奋了。
First of all, it will take about a month for Rhetsevier III clinical trials to come to fruition, and even making generic drugs requires Gilliard's authorization to produce and sell them.
只能说明公司能力强，这么短时间出仿制药，就算一个月以后临床试验成功，博瑞也是通过捐赠的方式给病人，并不会对业绩有实质性帮助。
Only that the company has the ability to produce generic drugs for such a short period of time. Even if the clinical trial is successful a month later, Bory will donate it to the patient without making a substantial difference to his performance.
