受访者供图━━━━━专家：是否复发致亡，不宜过早下结论李亮出院前两次核酸检测呈阴性，其出院时是否存在“假阴性”的可能？今日（3月5日）下午，国家卫健委专家组成员、北大第一医院呼吸和危重症医学科主任王广发接受新京报记者采访时表示，阴性转阳问题应该谨慎看待，不宜妄下结论。
2007-9-19 15: 48 Expert Group Meeting with New Peking News in the afternoon of March 5, Li Liang-fang, a member of the group who tested negative for two nucleic acid tests, told the Beijing News that negative transsexual problems should be treated with caution and should not be rushed to conclusions.
目前国内出现的“复阳”情况，可能和采样误差有关。
At present, the "Fuyang" situation in China may be related to sampling error.
他解释称，住院时，医生护士都穿着防护服和护目镜，工作又很紧张、劳动强度又大，可能会存在采样质量不足的问题，因此可能存在“假阴性”误差。
He explained that, while hospitalized, the doctors and nurses were wearing protective clothing and goggles, and the work was stressful and labour-intensive, and that there might be a problem with inadequate sampling quality, which could lead to "false-negative" errors.
王广发介绍，目前核酸检测仍是一个“金标准”，该方法还是被普遍公认和接受的。
Wang Guangfa said that at present nucleic acid detection is still a "gold standard," the method is generally recognized and accepted.
采样有很多讲究，比如采哪个部位，是采集鼻拭子还是咽拭子？深度是否够？采集量是否足够？可能存在不同。
Sampling has a lot of care, such as which part to pick, is the nose swab or swabs? Is the depth enough? Is the amount collected adequate? There may be differences.
另外是否也同时采集肛门拭子或大便？如果采集了，均进行检测，则可能提高检测阳性率。
Is it also possible to collect anal swab or stool at the same time? If they are collected, they are all tested, which may increase the positive rate of testing.
另外，也应考虑住院和出院后检测的实验室在技术和经验上造成差异。
Technical and empirical differences between in-patient and post-discharge testing laboratories should also be considered.

Play "new crown" healer why "Fuyang"? or intermittent detoxification was not found temporarily infectious.
新京报动新闻出品(ID：xjbdxw)王广发同时强调，“复阳”还有一种情况，即患者尚未痊愈，出现病毒载量增加，“但这种可能性比较小，随着康复治疗，排毒量应该越来越小，不会突然少了又多了。
Wang Guangfa, the Beijing News action news release, also stressed that the "Fuyang" situation, the patient has not recovered, there is an increase in viral load, "but this is less likely, as the rehabilitation treatment, the volume of detoxification should become smaller, not suddenly less.
”他承认，新冠病毒比较特殊，有可能出现双向病程，发烧好后又复发，这种现象在某些疾病是存在的，“但这种变化不仅伴随着病毒载量的变化，也伴随着临床症状的表现，比如又发烧、咳嗽。
He concedes that the new crown virus is unique in that it has the potential to develop a two-way course, develop a fever and then relapse, a phenomenon that exists in some diseases, "but this change is not only associated with changes in viral load, but also with clinical symptoms such as fever and cough.
”梅女士回忆，李亮二次入院前，没有出现明显的发烧、咳嗽等症状。
Ms May recalled that Li Liang did not show any symptoms such as fever or cough before re-admission.
对此，王广发认为，如果仅是核酸检测呈阳性，不伴随症状，“指向新冠肺炎复发的可能性比较小。
To this, Wang Guangfa believes that if only Nucleic acid positive, not accompanied by symptoms, "pointing to the possibility of a recurrence of new crown pneumonia is relatively small.
”针对梅女士反映的李亮“嘴巴发干，胃有点胀，身体无力”等症状。
Li Liang "has a dry mouth, a distended stomach and a weak body," as reflected by Ms May.
王广发分析认为，李亮出院后没有发烧、咳痰的表现，总体来讲，不像新冠肺炎再活动、再感染人体的表现，一般规律是应出现呼吸道症状伴随发烧。
Wang Guangfa analysis, Li Liang out of the hospital no fever, cough sputum, in general, unlike the new crown pneumonia reactivity, re-infection of the human body, the general rule is that respiratory symptoms accompanied by fever.
李亮的死亡诊断的原因为“呼吸道阻塞猝死”“呼吸循环衰竭”。
The cause of Li Liang's death diagnosis was "sudden respiratory obstruction death" and "respiratory failure."
王广发表示，应对其住院过程进行研究，新冠病毒感染治疗过程中是否有一些并发症，例如继发的心脏的损害、电解质的异常，肺栓塞在住院患者中也很常见。
Wang said the hospitalization process should be studied for complications such as secondary heart damage and electrolyte abnormalities, and that pulmonary embolism is common in hospitalized patients.
另外有无药物引起的不良反应，或是否有一些未发现的基础疾病，“应该好好分析，不宜过早下结论。
In addition, whether there are adverse drug-induced reactions, or whether there are some undetected underlying diseases, "should be carefully analyzed, not premature conclusions.
从目前报告出来的信息，我个人不倾向于是新冠肺炎没有治好。
From the information reported so far, I am not personally inclined to suggest that new crown pneumonia is not cured.
