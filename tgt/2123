”2月21日，名创优品向所有员工发布了一则“共克时艰倡议书”，呼吁以降薪来共度时艰。
On Feb. 21, Chuang Chuang-sheng sent out a letter to all his employees calling for pay cuts to be made to meet tough times.
“此次新冠肺炎疫情对中国的实体零售业冲击巨大，以线下为主的名创优品也遭受严重波及。
"The outbreak of new crown pneumonia has had a huge impact on the physical retail sector in China, with the main off-line brand-name premium products also suffering."
”名创优品对界面新闻表示，“发布此次倡议之前和之后，我们都对员工做了相关的意见收集，根据全员参与的调查数据显示，97.7% 的员工支持这个倡议。
"Both before and after the launch of the initiative, we conducted a survey of staff concerned, with 97.7 per cent of staff supporting the initiative, according to data from a full-time survey," the company told Interface News.
”该倡议书就员工薪资问题提出了两大倡议：一是1月份薪资（2月份发放，以下类推）全体员工按照税前应发的80%发放，2、3月份工资不同层级员工按不同标准发放，员工个人工作量不饱和的，则在上述基础上按实际情况再打折。
The proposal calls for two major initiatives on employee pay: First, all employees should be paid according to the 80 percent pre-tax payment in January (February, similar to the following), and employees should be paid according to different standards in February and March.
二是倡议部门及员工在疫情期间结合工作实际情况停薪留职。
Second, the initiative departments and employees during the epidemic combined with the actual situation of unpaid leave.
停薪留职薪资标准按照税前应发收入的30％发放，对于停薪留职期间工资不足以抵扣个人社保公积金部分的，差额部分由公司承担。
Leave without pay is paid at the rate of 30 per cent of pre-tax earnings, with the difference being borne by the company if the salary during the leave without pay period is not sufficient to offset the portion of the personal social security provident fund.
待疫情好转后，公司会根据工作的优先次序，逐步安排复工。
After the epidemic situation improves, the company will arrange to resume work gradually according to the priority of the work.
此外，名创优品还对四月份情况做了预设，“若不是很乐观，公司会无条件按二三月的政策继续执行一个月”。
The company also set a target for April, saying "if it is not optimistic, it will continue its February-March policy unconditionally for another month."
根据名创优品官网信息，2月份，名创优品在国内三分之二的门店暂停营业。
In February, two-thirds of the country's stores were closed for top-notch products, according to the website.
不过，在倡议书发布之后，便有多名员工在微博、知乎平台爆料称，虽宣称是自愿选择，但实际上并没有合理拒绝的余地。
However, after the release of the initiative, a number of employees in Weibo, know the platform reported that although the claim is a voluntary choice, but in practice there is no reasonable refusal.

”张超在名创优品工作3年了，在此次新冠肺炎疫情的冲击下，虽然无法前往公司，但也与其他员工一样，在家远程办公。
Zhang, who has worked for three years at Premiership Pneumonia, is telecommuting at home, like other workers, despite being unable to travel to the company.
但他没想到，疫情对个人的冲击来得这么快。
But he did not expect the epidemic to hit individuals so quickly.
一开始，降薪是以自愿原则进行意见征集的。
In the beginning, wage cuts were solicited on a voluntary basis.
2月6日，名创优品财务中心对员工表示，由于目前疫情，公司的收入大幅下降，亏损较大。
On February 6, a top-notch financial center told employees that the company's revenue had fallen sharply and its losses were high because of the current epidemic.
为了共度难关，很多公司也都做出了降薪、无薪假等各种举措。
Companies have also taken steps to cut pay and take unpaid leave to tide them over.
公司高管已申请放弃薪水，直到疫情结束，各部门也在动员减薪共度难关。
Executives have applied to forego salaries until the epidemic is over and departments are mobilizing to cut salaries to tide them over.
希望其余员工本着完全自愿的原则进行选择愿不愿意降薪，以及降薪多少。
It is hoped that the rest of the staff will choose whether or not to reduce their salaries on a completely voluntary basis and how much.
2月21日，在名创优品即将发放1月工资的前夕，所有员工正式接到了“共克时艰倡议书”。
On Feb. 21, on the eve of the release of Chong You's first monthly salary, all employees were formally briefed on the Difficult Times Initiative.
然而，他们却发现，这个降薪似乎没有太多拒绝的余地。
They found, however, that the pay cut did not seem to leave much room for refusal.
张超称，倡议书要求大家在23日24点前通过点选一个链接进行确认，但链接里根本没法选不同意，如果不同意降薪的话，需要另外向人力资源部门实名发送邮件。
Zhang said the proposal calls on people to click on a link before 24 o'clock on the 23rd to confirm, but there is no way to disagree with the link, if you do not agree to a reduction in wages, human resources departments to send a real name mail.
并且链接页面会有本人的名字水印，防止员工截图。
And link page will have my name watermark to prevent staff screenshots.
他认为，2月份受疫情影响降薪也算可以理解，但1月份全勤上班了却只发80%的工资不合理。
He said it was understandable that February's pay cuts were affected by the epidemic, but that it was not reasonable to pay 80 per cent of the salary when I went to work full time in January.
“疫情虽然有影响，也没必要全员搞降薪。
"Despite the impact of the epidemic, there is no need to reduce wages across the board.
因为不让大面积开除就搞这种，太鸡贼了。
Because it's not allowed to be fired on a large scale, chicken thieves.
经济总会好的，好了之后不发这部分还回来吗？”随后，多名员工在各大社交平台发文控诉名创优品降薪一事。
The economy is going to be okay, okay? "Then, employees sent messages on major social networking platforms complaining about pay cuts for premium products.
第二天，张超便接到人力资源私下的通知，称1月份工资会正常发放。
The next day, Zhang Chao received a private notification from human resources, said January wages will be normal.
但2月份仍维持只发放70%的工资，同时，如果工作饱和度评估不达标，还会进一步打折。
But only 70% of wages were paid in February, with further discounts if job saturation is assessed to be below par.
“如果可以，当然希望正常发工资啊。
"If I may, of course I want to be paid regularly.
”张超向界面新闻表达他的诉求，“公司暂时发不出那么多，那也要给个承诺，不发的什么时候补回来吧？也不能一刀砍完全不发吧？”对此次员工认为被迫降薪一事，名创优品对界面新闻回应称，意见收集显示97.7%的员工支持这个倡议，1月份薪酬已足额发放。
Zhang Chao told Interface News his appeal, "The company can't send out so much for the time being, so when do you want to make up for it or not at all?"
名创优品还对界面新闻表示，“薪倡议书只是一个倡议和意见征集，公司领导多次强调，只需把共克时艰的精神传达到位就好，要坚持自愿原则，不做强制要求。
"The proposal is just an initiative and a call for ideas," the company's leaders have repeatedly stressed. "Just put the difficult spirit into place, adhere to the principle of voluntarism, not mandatory requirements.
”对于一小部分提出异议的员工，名创优品称这些员工主要对1月份发放80%薪酬的倡议持不同意见。
For a small group of employees who contested the move, GE said they disagreed with the proposal to pay 80 per cent in January.
公司根据员工的反馈，立即对调薪倡议的内容做了优化调整，1月份薪酬已足额发放。
Based on employee feedback, the company immediately adjusted the content of the pay increase initiative and was fully paid in January.
事实上，降薪是名创优品疫情之中经营危机的体现。
In fact, wage cuts are symptomatic of a crisis in the management of an epidemic of premium goods.
虽然名创优品方面不愿透露具体销售数据，但相关负责人也对界面新闻表示目前经营压力巨大。
Although the name of premium products do not want to disclose specific sales data, but the relevant officials also said the interface news is currently operating under great pressure.
“目前主要是线下门店客流减少，销售额下降及仓库长时间停工，这也导致大量库存积压，现金流大幅减少，与此同时公司仍要负担人工薪酬和租金等固定成本。
"The current trend of reduced offline store traffic, falling sales and long store stoppages has also led to a large inventory build-up and a significant reduction in cash flow, while companies continue to bear fixed costs such as labour remuneration and rent.
”名创优品方面表示。
"The name of premium products said.
全球战略与管理咨询公司科尔尼公司估计称，2020年一季度，疫情将给中国整体零售餐饮业造成1.5-3万亿的经济损失。
Corni, a global strategy and management consultancy, estimates that the epidemic will cost China's entire retail restaurant industry between 1.5 and 3 trillion dollars in the first quarter of 2020.
美国波士顿咨询则指出，对于日用零售行业而言，疫情的短期影响则是“剧变式的行业扰动，。
Boston Consulting in the US said the short-term impact of the epidemic for the daily retail industry is "a dramatic industry disturbance."
隔离措施导致门店停业或者部分闭店，线下经营熔断，前线员工闲置，士气低落；以及库存积压，物流运力不足，企业现金流压力增大，投资扩张信息不足等。
Segregation measures have led to the closure or partial closure of stores, the breakup of off-line operations, idle frontline staff and low morale, as well as to the accumulation of inventory, inadequate logistics capacity, increased cash flow pressures on enterprises and insufficient information on investment expansion.
线下零售企业们纷纷往线上寻求生路，名创优品也不例外。
Retail enterprises have been looking for a way to live online, the name of premium products is no exception.
此前，名创优品曾宣布通过小程序及电商铺开线上购买渠道，同时发动员工及社群粉丝主动分享活动信息，为更多人提供防护类产品购买途径。
Earlier, the company announced that it had launched online shopping channels through small-scale programs and e-commerce. It also launched an initiative to share information on its activities among staff and community fans to provide a way for more people to buy protective products.
