本文由娱志The Review原创出品华东师范大学传播学院学生娱评号转载需申请授权作者 | 刘洋、唐铭、郭其编辑 | 华实"导语除夕夜，我的朋友圈几乎都是关于武汉疫情的消息，群里各种图片、小道消息，民间呼吁，澎湃和糟乱的情绪并存。
This article by the original production of The Review of the East China Normal University School of Communication School reprint by authorized authors & # 44; Liu Yang, Tang Ming, Guo Qi Editors & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
昨日娱志的一篇口述，以没那么全面但绝无作假的视角，描述了封城一日的武汉普通人家的故事。
Yesterday's entertainment, with a less comprehensive but no false perspective, described the closure of the first day of the ordinary Wuhan family story.
今日，我们尽力与家属是武汉一线或非一线医院工作者的三位朋友取得联系，请他们从旁观者视角描述一下奋战前线的医护人员所面临的一些基本情况。
Today, we tried to reach out to three friends whose families were first-line or non-first-line hospital workers in Wuhan, asking them to describe, from an onlooker's perspective, some of the basic conditions faced by health-care workers in the field.
再次申明：这不是新闻报道，仅仅只是口述，甚至还会出现彼此信息有矛盾的地方。
Once again, this is not a news report. It is only a word of mouth and there are even contradictions in each other's information.
这反而能体现出不同的人因为不同的渠道，和位置，所提供的信息的幅度与真实性有别。
On the contrary, it can show the difference between the extent and truth of the information provided by different people due to different channels and locations.
娱志只想让更多身在城内，或一线地带的个体的声音，以故事讲述的形式，被城外的人听到。
Recreation is only the desire to let more of the body in the city, or a line of individual voice, in the form of story-telling, heard outside the city.
尽管现在被告知，医护人员被要求不允许随便接受访问，任何形式都不可以。
Although they are now told that medical staff are not allowed to visit freely, no form of access is allowed.
按照娱志惯例，大年初一推出春晚评论，但考虑到实际情况，今日，娱志的春晚评论以次图文推出。
According to the custom, New Year's Eve launch of the Spring Festival Evening review, but in view of the actual situation, today, entertainment to the Chunwan commentary to launch.
"刘洋大姨：同济医院一线工作者医生会暴露感染很大一部分原因是，有大量市民前期隐瞒病史————————————————我家在X医院附近，大姨是同济医院的医护人员，她对目前一线的情况比较了解。
Auntie Liu: The front-line workers at Tongji Hospital may have been exposed in large part by the large number of people who had concealed their medical history - - - - - - - -). My family is near X Hospital, and Aunt Tongji Hospital's paramedic is familiar with the current situation.
20号中央了解武汉的真实情况后，立刻着手处理这里的疫情，目前几乎所有可以调动的相关医生都已经被安排在定点医院看诊，隔离医院也着手建造。
Central Committee No. 20 learned the truth about Wuhan, immediately began to deal with the epidemic here, almost all the relevant doctors can be mobilized has been arranged in the designated hospitals, and the construction of isolation hospitals has begun.
武汉的情况还是很糟心。
The situation in Wuhan is still very bad.
不过，网络上疯传的相关疫情消息，有些不能轻信。
However, the network crazy about the relevant epidemic information, some can not be credulous.
医生们的确很难，原本美满的除夕夜，该是和家人守着年夜饭团圆的日子，却身处在最危险的隔离区，连轴工作好几天。
Doctors are hard indeed. On the happy New Year's Eve, it was time to reunite with their families, but they were in the most dangerous isolation zones, working together for several days.
某种道德绑架感，生理和心理的不安全感，和超高负荷的运转，让他们发出连连“撑不住”的感慨，完全可以理解。
A certain sense of moral kidnapping, physical and psychological insecurity, and overloaded functioning make them feel like they can't last forever, quite understandably.
只是，有些在外广传的资讯过分夸张，甚至有造假的嫌疑。
However, some of the widely publicized information is exaggerated, and even a false suspicion.
定点医院存在医生暴露感染的情况，但网传同济医院被感染医生过世一事，纯属子虚乌有。
Doctors in designated hospitals have been exposed to infection, but the death of an infected doctor at Tongji Hospital on the Internet is completely untrue.
大姨跟我说，那人被传去世的前一天还在做蹲下起立。
Aunt told me that the man had been sitting in a squat the day before his death.
医生会暴露感染很大一部分原因是，有大量市民前期隐瞒病史，说自己没有去过华南海鲜城，但其实那时他们已经染上肺炎，医生放松警惕和他们接触，很容易被传染。
Doctors will expose the infection in large part because there are a large number of people who have concealed their medical history and said they had not been to Hai Xian City in South China, but by that time they had contracted pneumonia and doctors relaxed their vigilance and were easily infected.
事情发生变化是在20号央视发文的那一天，也就是中央掌握武汉真实情况的日子。
The change came on the day CCTV sent the message, the day the central authorities learned the truth about Wuhan.
之前这里的疫情，被隐瞒了太久太久。
Previous outbreaks here have been hidden for far too long.
20号那一天，这座已经满是疮痍的城市才真正被中央接管，中央直接插手武汉新型肺炎的防控工作。
On the 20th, the already-devastated city was taken over by the central government, which was directly involved in the prevention and control of Wuhan's new pneumonia.
现在医生的防护装备正在一点点优化。
The doctor's protective gear is being refined a little now.
不过，至少到现在，大部分医生都是自己扛，呼吁外界援助，这是没有办法的事情。
But until now, at least, most doctors are on their own, appealing for outside help.
同济协和一开始定点未完全设置，所以有很多疑似病人都在那边，金银潭医院直接接受协和发热病人。
Tongji Concorde was not fully set up at the beginning, so there are a lot of suspected patients over there, gold and silver pool hospital directly accept Concord fever patients.
不可否认，前几天很可怕，根本支撑不住。
Admittedly, the last few days are terrible, simply can not support.
昨天除夕夜，八点送到了第一批物资。
The first supplies arrived at eight on New Year's Eve yesterday.
从今天开始，物资陆陆续续运送到。
Starting today, supplies trickled in.
在这些物资和人员没到的昨天晚上，前线医务人员非常崩溃。
Last night, before the arrival of these supplies and personnel, the front-line medical staff collapsed.
还要补充一点消息。
I would like to add something.
大姨说，他们周围的很多小护士出行上班，是个很大的问题。
Aunt said it was a big problem for many of the nurses around them to travel to work.
公共交通取消了，没有私家车的，还找朋友借电动车。
Public transportation has been canceled, there are no private cars, and to borrow electric cars from friends.
医院没有专车接送，民间自发组织接送医护人员，并不是很全面。
Hospitals do not have special bus transportation, the civil organization of transport medical personnel, is not very comprehensive.
唐铭父母：中国人民解放军中部战区总医院非一线工作现在最大的问题，就是医疗物资紧缺————————————————武汉封城了，留下的一千万人都在恐惧，我也一样，但我已经是安全的大多数之一。
The biggest problem now is the shortage of medical supplies - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 10 million people are in fear, and so am I, but I am one of the safe majority.
为了保命，我每天把自己锁在家里，尽可能隔绝一切传染源，虽然家就在医院里，但不出门就不会有太大问题；要命的是，身为这座城里医护人员的家属，我时刻揪心着父母的安全。
To save my life, I locked myself in my house every day, cutting off all possible sources of infection, and though I was in the hospital, I could not go out without much trouble; cruelly, as the family of the town's paramedics, I was anxious for my parents' safety.
私心告诉我，绝不能让爸爸妈妈再走进诊室，那实在太危险了；但理性也在捶打我，在拯救生命的地方，他们必须是第一线的战士。
It's too dangerous to let Mom and Dad into the office again, I'm told, but reason is beating me, and they must be front-line fighters in places where lives are saved.
我的父母在中国人民解放军中部战区总医院（原广州军区武汉总医院）工作，这仅仅只是一家普通医院，并非现在武昌区的新型肺炎定点医院，目前若存在疑似病例，病人都会被劝到七医院或其他定点医院接受治疗，普通医院拒绝接收、治疗发热病人，但非定点医院的医生都没有回家，随时待命，到年后开始轮班。
At present, if there is a suspected case, the patients will be advised to go to seven hospitals or other designated hospitals to receive treatment. However, doctors from non-designated hospitals have not returned home and are on standby to start the shift after the year.
我的母亲在儿科诊室上班，除了顾好自己的科室外，他们也可能随时作为紧急医疗队、战备医疗队的一员，在一线遭遇突发事件时奔赴战场。
My mother works in the pediatric department and, in addition to attending to her own department, they may also be available as part of an emergency medical team or a combat readiness team on the battlefield in the event of a frontline emergency.
爸爸妈妈告诉我，他们的许多朋友在定点医院工作，一线的战斗用“兵荒马乱”形容，绝不为过。
Mom and Dad told me that many of their friends were working at the designated hospital and that the front-line fighting was described as "a mess," which could not be overstated.
现在的最大问题，如同网上爆料，医疗物资紧缺，完全跟不上需求：没有防护服，只有普通的白大褂；门诊医生和参与手术者才能使用医用外科口罩，留给其他医护人员的只有普通口罩，外界疯抢的N95在这里不存在，医生和护士几乎是直接暴露在医院里，和病人无隔绝接触。
The biggest problem, like online blasts, is that medical supplies are so scarce that they simply cannot keep up with demand: there are no protective clothing, only ordinary white coats; outpatient doctors and those involved in surgery can use medical surgical masks; only ordinary masks are left for other medical staff, N95, which is not available outside the hospital, and doctors and nurses are almost directly exposed to the hospital and isolated from patients.
爸爸同科室的同事跟着救护队到定点医院支援，最开始并没有护目镜。
Dad and his colleagues followed the ambulance team to the designated hospital, initially without goggles.
结果，那位同事一直发烧，现在被划为疑似病例，已经被隔离起来了。
As a result, the colleague has been feverish and is now classified as a suspected case and has been quarantined.
经过父母的描述，我了解到目前的情况是，武昌区发热门诊总数严重不足，已经超负荷；定点医院的医疗资源供不应求，无论是硬件还是软件都存在极大的缺口。
Based on my parents' description, I understand that the total number of fever clinics in Wuchang district is seriously inadequate and already overloaded. The medical resources of designated hospitals are in short supply.
到七医院就诊需要排上老久的队，而且可能没有位置。
Access to seven hospitals requires a long queue and may not have a seat.
有的项目甚至需要通宵排队。
Some projects even require an overnight queue.
轻度病症的疑似病例医院已经没有足够的空间给他们隔离，只能回家自行隔离吃药。
Hospitals with suspected cases of mild illness no longer have enough space to isolate them, so they have to go home and take their own medication.
大家最关心的试剂盒，目前在普通医院完全没有，定点医院也存在试剂盒数量不足的问题，网上热传的这一情况的确不假。
We are most concerned about the kit, the general hospital is not at present, there is a shortage of test kits in designated hospitals, this is true online heat transmission.
不只是武汉外的大家每天接收着漫天的疫情资讯，城内的我们也一样。
Wuhan is not the only people outside the daily receiving information about the epidemic situation in the city, we are the same.
刷屏朋友圈的消息有真有假，有些甚至当地医生都会在自己的朋友圈转发。
The news of the scrubbing circle of friends is untrue, and some even local doctors forward it in their circle of friends.
就我所了解到的，目前协和医院没有物资这一情况更靠近真实情况。
As far as I know, the lack of supplies at Concorde Hospital is closer to reality.
有的医生需要从汉口到武昌来，在全市公共交通瘫痪的情况下，如果没有私家车，就只能叫的士或滴滴，如今的士单双号限行，滴滴也暂停营业。
Some doctors need to travel from Hankou to Wuchang. If there are no private cars in the city, they can only call taxis or drips.
为了方便医生前往医院，政府配备了专门的车辆接送。
In order to facilitate doctors' access to hospitals, the Government has equipped special vehicles to transport them.
除了本地的医生外，这两天也陆续有北京、上海的医疗团队到定点医院的发烧诊室支援。
In addition to the local doctors, in the past two days, Beijing, Shanghai medical teams to the designated hospital to support the fever room.
郭其姑父：湖北省人民医院，现在被临时抽调去金银谭医院吃方便面干净啊，现在买熟食都不能确定是否卫生——————————————————————和大家一样，很多网上流传的消息，我无法确定。
Auntie Guo: Hubei Provincial People's Hospital, now temporarily evacuated to Tan Hospital to eat instant noodles, ah, it is not clear whether the purchase of cooked food - - - - - - - - - - - - -
不过，昨天晚上医护人员吃方便面的消息，在我看来，很正常啊。
But last night, the news that paramedics ate instant noodles seemed to me quite normal.
我从姑父那里了解到，同济医院的物资确实已经到了，同济协和的人都是吃方便面。
I learned from my uncle that supplies from Tongji Hospital had indeed arrived and that the people of Tongji Concord were eating instant noodles.
它干净啊，现在买熟食不能确定是否卫生。
It's clean. It's not sure if it's healthy to buy cooked food now.
至少，方便面外面都是塑料包装的。
At least, the instant noodles are wrapped in plastic.
今天一大早，姑父就被叫走了，35岁以下都被调去金银谭，“老家伙”们坐镇本院。
Early this morning, my uncle was called away, under the age of 35 were transferred gold and silver Tan, "old guys" sitting in the hospital.
现在医护人员严重不足。
Health care is woefully inadequate.
武昌地区定点医院人不够了，开始调其他区医院的医护人员。
Wuchang District Hospital is not enough people, began to transfer to other district hospitals medical staff.
如果去金银谭的人“阵亡”了，下一批人继续顶上。
If those who go to the gold and silver Tan "die in battle," the next group continues to top.
现在医护人员很难，警察也很难。
It's hard for paramedics and the police nowadays.
军队也不放假。
The army has no holidays.
昨天军队军医已经集结完毕了，第一批物资应该是今天要到了，还有全国各地第一批驰援的医生也集结完毕了，马上也要到了。
The army healers had been assembled yesterday, the first supplies were due to arrive to-day, and the first batch of doctors from all over the country had been assembled, and would be arriving soon.
但试剂盒，据我姑父说，根本不够啊。
But the kit, according to my uncle, is not enough.
这种试剂盒，用一次就要换，周边地区疑似病患太多，10w你以为够用吗？根本顶不住几天。
This kit, with one change, the surrounding areas are suspected to be too much patients, 10w do you think enough? Not for a few days.
还有防护服，不够，新闻说有医生穿尿不湿，就是怕污染了最后一套，这不是捏造的。
And protective clothing, not enough, the news said that a doctor wearing urine wet, is afraid of contaminating the last set, this is not a fabrication.
