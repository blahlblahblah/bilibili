本报记者 李向磊 周口报道1月23日，面对汹涌而来的新型冠状病毒疫情，武汉宣布封城。
Our reporter Li Xianglei Zhou Kou reported January 23, facing a surge of new coronavirus epidemic, Wuhan announced the closure of the city.
距离武汉400多公里之外的河南周口市，正保持着外松内紧的状态。
Wuhan, more than 400 kilometers away from the city of Zhou Kou, Henan, is maintaining a loose internal tight state.
1月21日，河南省卫健委微博发布消息，从武汉回到周口市太康县的一名66岁老者被国家卫健委确诊为河南首例输入性新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎确诊病例。
A 66-year-old man returning from Wuhan to Taikang County of Zhoukou City was confirmed by the State Health Commission as the first confirmed case of imported coronavirus infection in Henan Province on January 21.
《中国经营报》记者注意到，随着疫情的扩散，口罩等物资热销，并出现售罄状况。
China Business Daily noted that as the epidemic spread, supplies such as masks were on sale and sold out.
在周口市下面的吴台镇，记者走访了解到，此前售价为2元/包的一次性医用口罩，价格已经涨了四五倍，且处于供不应求的状态。
In the town of Wu Tai, below Zhoukou City, reporters visit learned that the price of 2 yuan / bag of disposable medical masks, prices have increased four or five times, and is in short supply.
此外，超市的蔬菜、水果价格也出现一定的上涨。
In addition, supermarket vegetables, fruit prices also rose.
外松内紧1月23日，农历腊月二十八，是吴台镇年前最后一个逢集的日子，前来赶集的人们络绎不绝。
On January 23, the 28th lunar month, the last fair day in Wu Tai town came to the market in an endless stream.
通往集市中心的一个五岔路口照例出现了堵车，挂着京、皖、浙等全国各地牌照的小轿车慢慢蠕动着前行。
To the market center of a five-fork road as usual there was a traffic jam, hanging Beijing, Anhui, Zhejiang and other license plates around the country slowly creeping forward.
就在两天前，距离吴台镇约70公里之外的周口市太康县，出现了河南首位确诊感染新型冠状病毒肺炎的患者。
Just two days ago, the first person in Henan Province to be diagnosed with the new coronavirus pneumonia occurred in Taikang county, Zhou Kou, about 70 kilometers away from Wu Tai town.
该确认感染的患者曾在武汉工作，2019年12月29日出现发热、胸闷气短等症状，2020年1月7日返回周口市就诊，随后转诊至郑州，1月20日患者转运至定点医院隔离治疗。
The patient, who was confirmed to have worked in Wuhan, developed fever and shortness of breath on 29 December 2019, returned to the city of Zhoukou on 7 January 2020 and was subsequently referred to Zhengzhou, where the patient was transferred to a designated hospital for isolation on 20 January.
随后，被国家卫健委确诊为河南首例输入性新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎确诊病例。
Subsequently, was confirmed by the National Health Commission as the first case of Henan imported new coronavirus infection confirmed pneumonia.
记者致电周口市卫健委，其工作人员告诉记者，相关领导正在开会研究疫情防控和应急措施。
The reporter called Zhou Kou health committee, its staff told reporters, relevant leaders are meeting to study epidemic prevention and emergency measures.
至于具体措施，需要联系应急办。
As for specific measures, emergency response offices need to be contacted.
随后记者多次致电周口市应急办，但均无人接听。
Subsequently, the reporter repeatedly called Zhou Kou City emergency response office, but no one answered.
“电话没人接，应该是正在开会，8点钟一个（会议），10点钟一个（会议），分别是河南省卫生健康和国家级的视频会议。
"No one answered the phone. It was a meeting at 8 o'clock and a meeting at 10 o'clock. It was a videoconference from Henan Province on health and national level.
”上述工作人员告诉记者。
The staff told reporters.
另据河南省卫健委微博消息，截至1月22日18时，河南累计报告新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎病例5例，所有病例均有武汉居住史，目前均在定点医疗机构接受隔离治疗。
According to Weijian Wei Bo in Henan Province, as of 18: 00 on January 22, Henan reported a total of five cases of new coronavirus infection of pneumonia, all of which have a history of residence in Wuhan, and are currently receiving isolated treatment in designated medical institutions.
无死亡病例。
There were no deaths.
小镇口罩也脱销1月23日下午，记者走访了吴台镇的多家药店发现，可用于预防新型冠状病毒肺炎的口罩仅有一次性医用口罩，价格从原来的2元/包上涨至8～10元/包，且处于脱销状况。
In the afternoon of January 23, reporters visited several pharmacies in Wu Tai town and found that the only surgical masks available to prevent the new coronavirus pneumonia were disposable surgical masks. The prices rose from $2 / bag to $8 to $10 / bag and were out of stock.
“俺不知道涨价，昨天几百包两个小时卖完了。
"I don't know the price hike. Yesterday hundreds of bags were sold out in two hours.
”位于镇南头的一家药店的老板有些懊恼地说，“昨天卖的是存货，不知道（口罩）涨价，还是按2元/包价卖的，今天上午又进了几百包，10块钱一包，现在只剩下几包了。
"Yesterday it was in stock, I didn't know whether it was going up, or it was sold at 2 yuan / package. This morning we got hundreds more bags, 10 yuan a pack, and now there are only a few bags left.
”该药店老板告诉记者，年前不会再进货了，因为口罩“抢都抢不到”。
The store's owner told reporters that it would not buy more masks until years ago because they "could not snatch them."
在另一家药店，记者看到，一次性医用口罩也仅剩数包，售价为8元/包。
At another drugstore, the reporter saw that only a few bags of disposable medical masks, selling for 8 yuan / bag.
药店负责人表示，现在口罩进货价涨得太厉害，即使卖8元的价格，也赚不了多少钱，主要是因为进价涨得太快。
The head of the pharmacy said the price of the mask was rising too high to make much money, even for eight yuan, mainly because the purchase price was rising too fast.
在记者走访中，不时碰到来药店买口罩的消费者，其中大部分消费者未佩戴任何类型的口罩。
In the reporter's visit, from time to time came to the drugstore to buy masks, most of the consumers did not wear any type of masks.
在其中一家药店，记者观察到，短短几分钟，剩余的几包一次性医用口罩也销售一空。
At one of the pharmacies, reporters observed that in just a few minutes, the remaining bags of disposable medical masks were sold out.
一位购买口罩的消费者告诉记者：“现在外出打工的人都回来了，戴着口罩多少可以起到一些预防作用，过年走亲戚不可避免去人多的地方，不过（戴着口罩）可能主要想有一个心理防护作用。
A consumer buying a mask told reporters: "Now that people are coming back, wearing masks can be more or less a preventive measure. Relatives who are visiting China's Lunar New Year are inevitably in large numbers, but [wearing masks] may primarily want to have a protective psychological effect.
”此外，记者在走访过程中也发现，部分超市的蔬菜、水果价格也出现了一定上涨。
In addition, the reporter in the course of the visit also found that some supermarket vegetables, fruit prices have also risen.
“芹菜前天九毛八一斤，昨天一块一毛八一斤，现在是一块七毛八一斤。
"" Celery was ninety-eight jin the day before yesterday.
”一位超市工作人员对询问的记者说，水果价格也有一定上涨，比如香蕉之前是2.18元/斤，现在是2.68元/斤。
A supermarket employee told reporters that there had also been a rise in fruit prices, from 2.18 yuan per catty before bananas to 2.68 yuan per catty now.
不过，在该工作人员看来，涨价的原因与蔓延的新型冠状病毒肺炎关系不大，“主要是青菜、水果不易储藏，年关将至买的人多，价格也就随之出现上涨”。
However, according to the staff member, the reason for the price increase is not related to the spread of the new coronavirus pneumonia, "mainly vegetables, fruits are not easy to store, the year will be more people to buy, prices will rise."
