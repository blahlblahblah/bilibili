燃财经（ID:rancaijing）原创作者 | 黎明编辑 | 魏佳2月18日，燃财经举办“创新经济战疫计划” 第三期线上沙龙，主题聚焦生鲜电商行业。
Flaming Finance (ID: Rancaijing) Former creator and dawn editor & # 124; & # 45; & # 45; On February 18, Flaming Finance hosted Phase III of the Innovative Economy & amp; Finance Program, an online salon focused on the fresh electricity business sector.
不惑创投创始合伙人李祝捷、每日优鲜合伙人兼CFO王珺就“穿越疫情，生鲜电商怎样把握新机会”这一话题进行了主题分享和互动对话。
Founding Partner Li Zhu Jie, Daily Outstanding Partner and CFO Jun Jun had a thematic discussion and interactive dialogue on the topic "Crossing the Epidemic and How Fresh Electric Showers Seize New Opportunities."
王珺分享的主题为《每日优鲜应对疫情的经验和挑战》，部分干货提炼如下：•疫情至今，每日优鲜实现了同比四倍左右的交易额，客单价达到120元，返工前的峰值达到150元；•生鲜电商行业的健康客单价门槛为80元，每日优鲜的前台毛利率约为券后25%-27%；•生鲜电商的履约成本，好的玩家平均约为15元，差一点的约为20元，最好的仓能做到11元；•疫情过后，生鲜电商行业会加速全国型玩家的崛起，市场份额更向头部集中，同时开始出现一些细分子品类的市场机会；•每日优鲜今年预计在所有成熟区域实现盈利，但目前没有上市计划。
The topic shared by Wang Jun is "Daily experience and challenges in coping with the epidemic." Some dry products are refined as follows: The daily premium is about four times the same as before, with a unit price of 120 yuan and a peak of 150 yuan before rework.
以下是每日优鲜合伙人兼CFO王珺在燃财经沙龙上的详细分享内容：疫情初期挑战组货能力派出300人到产地组织采摘我们最早对疫情进行响应是在1月21日，根据当时的新闻报道，我们觉得疫情可能会非常严重，于是第一时间成立了响应小组，制定了一个简短的应急预案，主要包括配送站点、配送员和一线作业人员的安全防护，以及消毒的保障措施。
The following is a detailed daily sharing of the CFO Jun with the Fuel Economy Salon: Initial Challenge Group Cargo Capability Send 300 people to the production area to pick our first response to the outbreak according to press reports at the time, so we immediately set up a response team to develop a short contingency plan including safety precautions for distribution stations, distributors and front-line operators, and disinfection safeguards.
同时我们对口罩和消毒液这些物资进行紧急备货，保证满足一线员工的自用要求。
At the same time, we carry out emergency supplies such as masks and disinfectants to ensure that the requirements of front-line staff for their own use.
然后我们保证库存充足，价格合理。
Then we can make sure the stock is adequate and the price reasonable.
除此之外，我们开始极速达业务，在绝大部分地区执行春节不打烊的战略。
In addition, we began to reach the business in the vast majority of areas to implement the Spring Festival closed strategy.
另外，我们取消了华中地区的同学回家和总部同学赴武汉出差的计划。
In addition, we cancelled the Central China students to go home and headquarters students to Wuhan on business plans.
很快疫情就发展到了第二阶段，政府开始倡导市民居家隔离和自我防护，然后物资的需求也迅速增长。
Soon after the outbreak reached its second stage, the government began to advocate for residential isolation and self-protection, and demand for supplies grew rapidly.
这段时间每日优鲜的主要挑战是保障商品和服务的供给。
The main daily challenge of this period is to secure the supply of goods and services.
大年初一我们就开始建立疫情应对指挥部，启动了守护行动，确定了大概的方案，主要是力保供应，服务用户。
On New Year's Day, we began to set up an epidemic response command, launched the guardian action, identified the general program, mainly to protect the supply, service users.
守护行动已经进行了接近一个月，现在我们能够保证果蔬肉蛋等生鲜产品的充足供应，每天能保证大概1500吨的蔬菜生鲜供给，主要城市里九成的订单能够在两小时内送达。
The Guardian has been going on for nearly a month, and we are now able to ensure an adequate supply of fresh produce such as fruit and vegetable eggs, about 1,500 tons of fresh vegetables a day, and 90% of orders in major cities within two hours.
疫情主要挑战的是生鲜零售商供给侧的能力，因为需求侧出现了井喷。
The main challenge for the epidemic is the supply-side capacity of fresh retailers, as demand-side blowouts occur.
在供给侧，我们主要认为是三段，第一是组货，第二是管仓或者叫管门店，第三是管配送。
In the supply side, we mainly think of three segments, the first is the group goods, the second is the pipe warehouse or called pipe store, the third is pipe distribution.
早期的矛盾主要在供给侧，集中在组货上，疫情刚发生的时候，产地发生了大量的封村和封路。
Early contradictions mainly in the supply side, concentrated in the group goods, when the outbreak of the outbreak, the origin of a large number of villages and blockades.
农民无法下地摘菜，大量的蔬菜滞销在田间地头，无法按原来的渠道流通到餐桌上。
Farmers are unable to pick vegetables, large quantities of vegetables unsaleable in the field, unable to flow to the original channel to the table.
我们在这个时候快速动员全国300个商品买手同学到产地组织人员采摘，然后跟政府部门做好沟通，保障了产地供给。
At this time, we quickly mobilized 300 commodity buyers across the country to organize picking, and then with government departments to do a good job of communication, to ensure the production of supplies.
在春节期间，我们快速组织了一天500吨的蔬菜生产，一周后提升到1000吨一天，现在大概在1500到2000吨一天。
During the Spring Festival, we quickly organized the production of 500 tons of vegetables a day, which rose to 1000 tons a day a week later, and now it is about 1,500 to 2,000 tons a day.
与此同时，我们之前准备的很多直采基地不够了，于是我们又紧急调配了内蒙古、云南、山东、北京周边的产地资源，采购人员驻守产地，协调生产和发货，这样来保障供给。
At the same time, many of the direct mining bases we had prepared were insufficient, so we urgently deployed the resources of the producing areas around Inner Mongolia, Yunnan, Shandong and Beijing.
保证足够的打包人员和配送人员是行业难题商品供应链的挑战现在基本上已经解决了，重复而关键的民生商品，现在大家都能够买得到。
Ensuring adequate packaging and distribution of personnel is an industry conundrum. The challenge of commodity supply chains is now largely resolved, with repetitive and critical consumer goods now available to all.
春节返工之后，我们开始建议用户不要囤货了。
After the Spring Festival rework, we began to advise users not to stock up.
从初八第一波返工潮开始，出现了供给侧的第二个挑战，就是对仓内打包人员和配送人员的挑战。
From the beginning of the first wave of back to work, the supply side of the second challenge, that is, the warehouse packaging and distribution of personnel.
仓内有大量的大仓加工和微仓打包人员，以及一线的配送人员。
The warehouse has a large number of warehouse processing and micro-warehouse packaging staff, as well as the front-line distribution personnel.
这些人的安全保障、情绪疏导、服务质量保障，都是在过去的两周内整个行业最大的难题。
Their safety, emotional well-being and quality of service are among the biggest challenges facing the industry over the past two weeks.
因为我们有春节不打烊的经验，我们快速提出了一线人员的补贴预算，保障一线人员享受到疫情期间的特殊津贴，让大家能够风险和收益对等。
Because we have the experience of not closing up for the Spring Festival, we quickly put forward a subsidy budget for front-line staff to ensure that they receive special allowances for the duration of the epidemic, so that everyone can share the risks and benefits.
我们给员工买了保险，保证每个一线员工有200万的额度，百分百理赔。
We bought insurance for our employees, guaranteed a limit of 2 million per first-line employee, 100% settlement.
同时我们安排一线交付人员每个人责任到仓，进行一对一的思想沟通，缓解大家的焦虑情绪。
At the same time, we arranged for each frontline delivery person to take responsibility to the warehouse for one-on-one thought communication to ease everyone's anxiety.
除了早期近三周的遭遇战，我们认为疫情期间生鲜零售行业供给侧的挑战，正在进入第二个阶段，我们叫做阵地战。
In addition to the early encounters of nearly three weeks, we believe the supply-side challenges in the fresh retail sector during the epidemic are entering their second phase, which we call trench warfare.
这个阶段既挑战快速组织存量服务形态的能力，也挑战供给侧的创新服务能力。
This phase challenges both the ability to quickly organize the stock of services and the capacity of supply-side innovation services.
供给侧创新主要是在商品的SKU形态和配送的劳动力组织两端。
Supply-side innovation is mainly in the form of goods SKU and distribution of labor organizations at both ends.
在商品侧，我们开始连接西贝和蜀海等传统的餐饮企业。
On the commodity side, we began to connect traditional restaurants such as Sebei and Shu Hai.
除了蔬菜供应，我们还增加了一些半成品的餐食和速食的供应，也在开发一些更方便用户食用的懒人菜和方便菜。
In addition to the vegetable supply, we have increased the availability of semi-finished meals and ready-to-eat items, and are developing more user-friendly lazybones and convenience foods.
第二是在配送运力的组织，我们开始成规模地引入异业的劳动力进行合作，比如餐饮领域的标准菜的加工，会由他们来完成，然后会有其他行业的员工成为我们微仓的运力，我们的大仓也会直接接收一部分餐饮行业的人。
Second, in organizations with distribution capacity, we are beginning to bring in migrant workers on a large scale. For example, the processing of standard food in the catering industry will be done by them, and then there will be employees from other industries who will become the capacity of our micro-warehouse, and our warehouse will receive a portion of the catering industry directly.
总体看来，我们觉得第一个阶段挑战的是公司过去几年积累的组织能力，快速打遭遇战来组货和配送。
Overall, we feel that the first phase of the challenge is the organization of the company over the past few years, rapid encounter to organize goods and distribution.
第二个阶段挑战的是公司的数字化运营能力，如何在做好持续高效服务的同时，来建立进一步创新的能力。
The second challenge is the company's ability to operate digitally, how to do a continuous high-efficiency service, while building the capacity for further innovation.
对话王珺：疫情期间交易额同比增长约四倍燃财经：能否分享一些每日优鲜在疫情前后的业务数据并做对比？另外，疫情期间的用户需求有哪些特点？王珺：疫情对需求侧产生了非常强的刺激作用。
Jun: The trade volume during the outbreak is about four times higher than the year-on-year. Can you share and compare some daily good business data before and after the outbreak? Also, what are the characteristics of the user requirements during the outbreak?
目前看来，我们大概可以同比实现四倍左右的交易额。
At the moment, we can probably do about four times as much as the year before.
同时在我们用户的订单形态上，明显看到用户的客单价在提升。
At the same time in the form of our customers' orders, it is clear that the customer unit price is increasing.
疫情前，用户客单价在85元到90元之间，每笔订单会购买近十件货。
Prior to the outbreak, customer prices ranged from 85 yuan to 90 yuan per order for nearly 10 items.
现在用户每笔订单购买的件数进一步增加，而且出现了对客单价更高的标品的囤货行为，这拉动了我们的货件数和件单价双涨。
There is now a further increase in the number of purchases per order and a hoarding of items with higher unit prices, which has pushed up both the number of pieces and the unit price of items.
我们的客单价在疫情期间已经达到了120元，返工前的峰值达到了150元。
Our customer unit price during the epidemic period has reached 120 yuan, rework before the peak of 150 yuan.
总体而言，疫情期间，用户以前被超市、次日达电商以及线下零售解决的超市品类和非生鲜品类购物需求，开始通过一站式购物沉淀在每日优鲜。
Overall, during the epidemic, users were previously identified by supermarkets, day-after-day retailers and off-line retail outlets for supermarket and non-raw shopping needs, starting to precipitate through one-stop shopping in the daily high-quality.
同时在用户购买的商品的组合上，开始增加了更多的预制菜和半成品菜，我们看到这两个品类在明显的快速的提升。
At the same time, more prefabricated and semi-finished vegetables are beginning to be added to the mix of goods purchased by users, and we are seeing a marked and rapid improvement in both categories.
燃财经：疫情期间，每日优鲜在物流和配送方面踩过哪些坑？有什么启发？王珺：主要是供给侧的不足，人手不足，然后就是人员会焦虑，安全保障不容易。
Fuel economy: What craters did daily top quality run through in terms of logistics and distribution during the outbreak? What are the implications? Jun Wang: Mainly supply side deficiencies, understaffing, then staff anxiety, safety is not easy.
但我们在人手不足这方面还是相对有经验的，因为过去两年我们都已经做了春节不打烊的项目，在春节这种本身就供给不足的时候，还要维持一定的全价值链的劳动力，本身先储备了一些战略配送人员。
However, we are relatively experienced in understaffing, as we have been working on the Spring Festival closing programme for the past two years, and in the Spring Festival itself, when there is a shortage of supply, we have to maintain a full value chain labor force and have some strategic distribution personnel in reserve.
但是疫情发生之后，确实在供给侧出现了明显的人员短缺，这个时候最有效的办法其实就是抢人。
But after the outbreak, there was a clear shortage of personnel on the supply side, and the most effective way to do so was to rob people.
我们当时抢人就是赶紧给一线人员配备了新的订单政策，保证这个政策在市场上有充分的竞争力，让让大家愿意来干。
We were just robbing the front-line staff of the new order policy, to ensure that the policy in the market is fully competitive, let everyone willing to do.
燃财经：一线人员春节期间几倍工资？ 王珺：基本上都是双倍以上。
Finance: Several times salary during Spring Festival for frontline workers? Jun Wang: Almost double.
包括一线打包和配送的人工成本。
Includes labour costs for first-line packaging and distribution.
燃财经：是不是卖得越多、亏得越多，你作为CFO应该最了解了，请为我们分享一下每日优鲜的实际情况。
Flaming Finance: The more you sell and the more you lose, the better you should know as a CFO. Please share with us some of the best daily facts.
王珺：是否卖得越多亏得越多，这要看是不是会出现订单层面的边际亏损。
Jun Wang: The more you sell, the more it depends on whether there is a marginal loss at the order level.
生鲜到家是有一个相对结构性的固定的履约成本，包括大仓段、前置仓段，以及配送段整段，整个行业做下来，好的玩家平均是15元，差一点的约为20元，最好的仓能做到11元，这里面包含了所有合规的口径。
Live home is a relatively structured fixed cost of performance, including large positions, forward positions, and distribution segments. The industry as a whole is doing well, with good players averaging 15 yuan, nearly 20 yuan, and the best warehouse being 11 yuan, which includes all the required calibres.
所以成本很重要，需要建立一个健康的客单价。
So cost is very important, need to establish a healthy customer unit price.
我们也在观察这个行业，我认为，如果线下的整个生鲜零售，大概是20个点到22个点的损前毛利率，再加上我们这样的业态额外做的一段大仓加工，加上小干线（这段本身也是供应链成本，会反哺到前台的毛利上，因为多承担了一段价值链节点），前台毛利大概是在券后25到27个点。
We're also looking at the industry, and I think that if the whole fresh retail offline is about 20 to 22 points, plus an extra slice of processing like ours, plus the trunk line (which itself is a supply chain cost that feeds back into the foreground because it takes on an extra value chain node), the front end margin is about 25 to 27 points behind the coupon.
如果要覆盖至少15元一单，也就是打平订单的客单价的门槛，我觉得是在60元。
If you want to cover at least $15 a piece, that is, the flat order customer unit price threshold, I think it is 60 yuan.
如果还要进一步的覆盖获客和总部成本，比较健康的客单价需要在80元。
If you want to further cover the customer and head office costs, the more healthy unit cost of the customer needs to be 80 yuan.
其实在疫情之前，我们的客单价就已经是80元的水平，也能够在今年实现全国的经营利润率为正，所以这对我们来说并不是一个挑战。
In fact, before the epidemic, our customer unit price is 80 yuan, can also achieve a positive national operating margin this year, so this is not a challenge for us.
但我认为要建立一个平衡的客单价，确实对整个行业是非常大的挑战。
But I think it's a real challenge for the industry to establish a balanced customer unit price.
因为这个客单价不能靠涨价获得，也不能靠卖高端的货获得，而是要让用户来交叉购买，所以这需要有足够强的商品力，而且是跨品类的商品力，让用户愿意把钱花在这里。
Since the unit price of the customer cannot be obtained by price increases, nor can it be obtained by selling high-end goods, but by allowing users to cross-purchase, this requires commodity power that is strong enough to make users willing to spend their money on it.
今年预计在所有成熟区域实现盈利燃财经：每日优鲜目前的商业化进展如何？离规模化盈利还有多远？王珺：这需要多年的供应链积累。
This year is expected to be profitable in all mature regions: How is the current commercialization of Daily Fresh? How far is it from becoming profitable? Wang Jun: It takes years of supply chain accumulation.
比如只有采购成本低，在同样加价率上才能卖得便宜，选品要准，周转要快，备货要充分，损耗还要低，这些都会影响整个生鲜零售的成本结构。
For example, only low procurement costs, in the same rate can be sold cheaply, accurate selection, quick turnover, adequate stock, low consumption, all of which will affect the entire fresh retail cost structure.
当然，刚才讲的履约成本里面，其实是没有包含损耗的，因为我们已经能够通过精准的备货，把损耗控制在全局1到1.5个点之内，也就是说从商品进入大仓，到用户手上只有这么1到1.5个点，而且是在全国都做到这个水平。
Of course, the cost of performance just mentioned is not included, because we have been able to control losses in the global range of 1 to 1.5 points, that is, from the entry of goods into the warehouse to the user's hands, and at this level throughout the country.
所以我觉得，生鲜零售行业进入不难，但是要做出利润确实很难。
So I think it's easy to get into the fresh retail business, but it's really hard to make a profit.
我们今年预计在所有成熟区域实现盈利。
We expect to make a profit this year in all mature regions.
燃财经：每日优鲜的商品在疫情期间有没有涨价？王珺：疫情期间，我们没有去提高商品的售价，这是行业的自律，也是政府的要求。
[color = Purple] [color = Purple] [color = Purple] [/ color] [color = Purple] [color = Purple] [color = Purple] [color = Purple] [/ color] [color = Purple] [color = Purple] [color = Purple] [color = Purple] [color = Purple] [color = Purple] [color = Purple] [color = Purple] [color = Purple] [color = Purple] [color = Purple] [color = Purple] [color = Purple] [color = Purple] [color = [color = [/ color]]] [color = [color = [/ color]] [color] [color] [color] [color] [color] [color] [color] [color] [color] [color =] [color = Purple] [color = Purple]
燃财经：和叮咚买菜、美团买菜等对手相比，每日优鲜有什么优劣势？王珺：我认为每日优鲜的核心竞争力集中在供给侧。
Caijing: What are the advantages and disadvantages of a daily average versus Dong-dong food shopping and grocery shopping? WANG Jun: I think the daily superior core competency is concentrated on the supply side.
第一是跨品类商品的采购和运作能力，这尤其会体现在最终的商品力上，包括买手形成的统采能力、直采能力、选品能力、备货能力、系统驱动的供需管理能力，还有交叉销售以及推荐能力，最终的结果就是多品类的商品都能够呈现出商品力和竞争力，这样用户就会分配更多的时间和金钱在这个平台，每单的客单价也会有提升的机会。
The first is the ability to procure and operate across a wide range of commodities, particularly in terms of ultimate commodity power, including purchasing power, direct acquisition, product selection, stock preparation, system-driven supply and demand management, and cross-selling and referral capabilities. The end result is that a wide range of goods can become commodity and competitive, allowing users to allocate more time and money to the platform.
交叉销售会造成每单的客单价更高，背后的原因可能是每一件sku的价格没有变化，但是每一单的货件数明显高了。
Cross-selling leads to a higher unit price per order, which may be explained by the fact that the price per sku has not changed, but the number of items per order is significantly higher.
过去的五年，我们一直在投入全品类采购和运作的能力，我们现在有300多个买手来保证我们的商品力。
Over the past five years, we have been investing in the full range of procurement and operations capabilities, and we now have more than 300 buyers to guarantee our commodity strength.
现在我们已经有行业相对最好的客单价模型，而且是在维持民生价格带的前提下。
Now we have the industry's relatively best customer unit price model, and is in the maintenance of the price of people's livelihood under the premise.
第二点，我认为这个生意最重要的是大规模分布式连锁节点的管理运营能力。
Second, I think the most important thing in this business is the ability of large-scale distributed chain nodes to manage operations.
这件事情其实在行业内有两种实践，有的玩家相信传统连锁的基于店长的连锁管理，但每日优鲜更寄希望于数字化的解决方案。
In fact, there are two practices in the industry, some players believe in traditional chain store-based chain management, but the daily best hope for digital solutions.
每个店长的经营职能，包括了日常的选品定价促销、备货、损耗管理、打包配送。
The management functions of each store manager include daily product pricing promotion, stock preparation, loss management, packaging and distribution.
我们把这些履约类的职能分开，经营类的职能全都让系统取代了。
We separate the functions of these performance categories and let the systems replace all of them.
今天我们有近千个前置仓，每个仓每个具体的单品，都是根据这个仓周围用户的需求来做的个性化备货。
Today we have nearly a thousand forward positions, each specific unit of the warehouse, are based on the needs of users around the warehouse to make a personalized inventory.
个性化经营的主体并不是我们的超级店长，而是我们中台的AI系统，我们自己的供需算法。
The subject of personalized management is not our super store director, but our middle-class AI system, our own algorithm of supply and demand.
这样我们能够通过中心化的运营，保障生意极强的复制性。
In this way, we can ensure the replication of a very strong business through the central operation.
因为中心化运营的算法能够个性化处理不同分布式节点的需求形态，所以我们又保证了生鲜零售这个本地化经营的本质，在用户侧体验足够好。
Because the centralized operation algorithm can personalize the demand form of different distributed nodes, we also ensure the quality of the local management of fresh retail, the user side experience is good.
所以每日优鲜最核心的价值，我觉得主要是两点：商品供应链、数字驱动的分布式连锁管理。
So the most core value of daily excellence, I think there are two main points: commodity supply chain, digital-driven distributed chain management.
这是我们在行业内投入足够多并坚持的核心竞争力。
This is the core competitiveness that we invest enough and persist in the industry.
疫情加速生鲜行业全国型玩家的崛起燃财经：疫情之下每日优鲜也做了一些新尝试，和西贝、眉州东坡等餐饮企业的合作进展如何？营销意义之外，对你们业务的实际帮助有多大？王珺：跟餐饮企业的合作，除了劳动力之外，主要还是集中在半成品菜、预制菜、懒人菜这种商品的SKU开发上。
The Rising of National-level Players in the Outbreak Acceleration Industry Flames Finance: How are the daily specialties such as Xibei and Meizhou Dongpo developing in cooperation with other catering companies? Apart from the marketing significance, the technology is mainly focused on SKU development of semi-finished vegetables, prepared vegetables and lazybones.
因为我觉得这是在未来一段时间内，用户仍然不方便去线下餐厅购物，或者不方便去吃外卖的情况下，我们能够有效地让用户通过做饭来改善饮食体验的一个方法，我们确实也看到这样的需求在井喷，比如我们的酸菜鱼卖的特别好，甚至最近还看到行业里开始出现一些高端单品比如佛跳墙开始出现到家的解决方案。
Because I think it's a way for users to be unable to shop in an offline restaurant for some time, or to eat takeaway, we can effectively get users to improve their eating experience by cooking, and we do see a surge in demand, such as sour fish selling exceptionally well, and more recently high-end items such as jump walls starting to come home.
所以我觉得，这一波疫情本质上会驱动用户对于食品安全等工业级标准化供应链的诉求，这也会对我们的SKU组合长期造成影响，所以我们会加速对这类懒人菜、方便菜、半成品菜的投入。
So I think this epidemic will essentially drive the demand for industry-level standardized supply chains like food safety, which will also have a long-term impact on our SKU mix, so we will accelerate our investment in this kind of lazybones, convenience foods, and semi-finished vegetables.
燃财经：疫情结束后，如何做好用户留存？还有哪些事情是每日优鲜今年要重点布局的？王珺：我们觉得留存跟过去几年一样，最主要还是要通过稳定可信赖的体验来形成用户习惯，然后同时维持商品价格的加价率不超过超市，这样既可以保证商品力不比超市差，同时在方便度上有明显有优势，用户就会形成留存。
The most important thing we think is to form a user habit through a stable and reliable experience, and then maintain the price mark-up rate of no more than the supermarket, which will ensure that the product is not inferior to the supermarket and has obvious advantages in convenience, the user will form a retention.
我们今年开始逐步给用户导入非及时达的场景，增加超市这些更长尾商品的购物体验，引入了优先超市这个业态，用户未来可以有3000款商品一小时达，甚至数万款商品次日达这样的形态来满足一站式购物需求。
This year, we began to gradually introduce non-timely delivery scenarios to customers, increase the shopping experience of these longer-tailed goods in supermarkets, and introduced the preferred supermarket industry, whereby users can have up to 3,000 items an hour or even tens of thousands of items in the next day to meet one-stop shopping needs.
重点布局的肯定是我们在供应链侧，供给侧，商品供应链上游的统采和直采。
Key layout is certainly in the supply chain, supply side, upstream of the commodity supply chain and direct mining.
然后以及我们算法驱动的大规模分布式连锁的管理，这是我们还会在今年持续投入的两个核心能力。
And then there's our algorithm-driven management of large-scale distributed chains, two core competencies that we'll continue to invest in this year.
燃财经：每日优鲜在维持健康的现金流方面有哪些经验？王珺：维持健康的现金流我觉得有几个要素，第一是零售本身的毛利率其实也就不超过30个点，生鲜20多个点。
[color = Purple] [color = Purple] [color = Purple] [color = Purple] [/ color] [/ color] [color = [color = [/ color]]] [/ color] [/ color] [color] [color = [/ color]] [/ color] [/ color] [color =] [color] [color = [color = [/ color]]]
在这样的毛利下，非常考究一个零售商对于OPEX（运营成本）的控制能力。
Under such margins, a retailer's ability to control OPEX (operating costs) is well researched.
核心就是在履约成本项的坪效、人效、网络的规划扩张和利用，能不能平衡好。
The core is in the performance cost of the Peng-effect, human effectiveness, network planning expansion and utilization, can balance well.
所以抓好分布式连锁的管理运营效率，这是我们过去五年坚持的事情。
So grasp the distributed chain of management efficiency, this is the last five years we adhere to things.
第二是要建立一个足够强大的商品力，这样能够拿到市场合理的毛利率。
The second is to build a strong enough commodity power, so that the market can get a reasonable gross margin.
并且不要做过度的补贴，当然在补贴上每日优鲜过去几年也走过一些弯路，但我们现在已经把这个问题完整的调整好了。
And don't over-subsidize, of course, and there have been some detours in subsidies over the past few years, but we've now fully adjusted the issue.
第三是我觉得要把钱投入到能够产生运营效率提升的地方，比如买手建立、前置仓网络建立等。
The third is that I feel I need to invest my money where I can improve operational efficiency, such as buying hands, building up a front-end warehouse network, etc.
燃财经：疫情对生鲜电商行业有何重构作用？小型电商企业是否迎来了发展空间？王珺：疫情对行业的重构是有的，因为现在我们就一起加速了整个生鲜行业两年以上的渗透速度。
Fuel economy: What is the effect of the epidemic on the fresh electricity industry? Is there room for the development of small electrical enterprises? Jun Wang: The disease reconstructs the industry because together we are now accelerating the penetration rate of the whole fresh industry for more than two years.
我觉得会出现的几个趋势是，生鲜电商行业会加速全国型玩家的崛起，然后市场份额更向头部集中。
I think there are a couple of trends where the live electronics industry will accelerate the rise of national players and then concentrate more on the head.
同时因为整体渗透率的提升，用户习惯养成，开始出现一定的利基市场机会，包括围绕部分区域的玩家以及围绕一些细分的子品类的玩家都会有机会。
At the same time, as overall penetration increases and user habits develop, niche market opportunities begin to emerge, including around players in selected areas and in some subcategories of subdivisions.
但总体看来，小型玩家如果在这个时候进入市场，需要做好差异化，因为全国型玩家会更快完成市场份额的整合。
But overall, small players need to be differentiated if they are to enter the market at this time, because national players will be able to achieve market share consolidation faster.
生鲜零售毕竟是一个零售，我认为还是会出现多业态并存、多玩家并存的趋势，市场份额的集中度不会像互联网一样呈现典型的高度集中。
After all, fresh retail is a retail business, I think there will be a multi-industry coexistence, multi-player trend, market share concentration is not as typical of the concentration of the Internet.
燃财经：你觉得疫情过后，会不会出现大规模裁员现象？疫情过后，中小企业如何快速恢复生产？王珺：我们不会出现大规模裁员情况，因为我们的用户留存其实只要买过三单就非常稳健了，所以我们最主要的任务是疫情之后稳住这些用户，给他们持续提供好的服务。
Finance: Do you think there will be large-scale layoffs after the outbreak? How can the small and medium-sized enterprises resume production quickly after the outbreak? WANG Jun: We won't have large-scale redundancy because our users are very healthy after buying only three, so our primary task is to stabilize these users after the outbreak and provide them with good services on a continuous basis.
中小企业在疫情后如何恢复这个问题，我建议关注几个事情，第一是关注疫情带来的行业结构性的变迁，比如小农经济的供应链，在食品安全上有挑战的供应链可能在这波疫情后都会面临长期的挑战，甚至逐步被成熟的供应链和连锁供应链挤出市场。
The first is to focus on the structural changes in industries brought about by the epidemic, such as the supply chain of small-scale farmers, whose food-security-challenging supply chains may face long-term challenges in the wake of the epidemic, and even gradually be pushed out of the market by mature supply chains and chain supply chains.
第二是线下线上渗透率的进一步提升，会导致部分线下业态的成本结构无法再维持。
The second is the further increase of the penetration rate on the offline line, which will result in the cost structure of the partial offline state being no longer sustainable.
所以有些业态在恢复营业的时候可能要注意，是否要做业态的调整。
Therefore, some industry in the resumption of business may have to pay attention to whether or not to make adjustments in the industry.
第三是一般在疫情结束之后，整个线下经济会有一个快速的回暖期，用正确的模式和正确的产品，抓紧赶在这个窗口期快速恢复业务。
The third is that after the epidemic is over, there will be a quick recovery period for the entire offline economy, with the right patterns and the right products, to get back to business fast at this window.
燃财经：每日优鲜有没有IPO计划？王珺：我们没有上市的计划，还是先做好盈利性增长，做好用户渗透，做好供应链和系统能力建设。
