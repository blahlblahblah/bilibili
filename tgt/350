1月20日，国家卫生健康委高级别专家组组长、中国工程院院士、国家呼吸系统疾病临床研究中心主任钟南山表示：从目前疫情的地理分布、感染人群来看，此次疫情跟武汉海鲜市场关系很密切。
On January 20, Zhong Nan-shan, head of the high-level group of experts of the National Health and Health Commission, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and Director of the National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Diseases, said Zhong Nanshan, director of the National Center for Clinical Research on Respiratory Diseases.
当前防控最有效的办法就是早发现、早诊断、早治疗、早隔离。
The most effective methods of prevention and control are early detection, early diagnosis, early treatment and early isolation.
此时，曾在金银潭医院就诊的患者王康已经出院。
At this time, in the gold and silver pool hospital patient Wang Kang has been discharged.
从2019年12月24日感觉难受开始，到1月15日治愈出院为止，他经历了两次转院、血氧含量一度低至危险状态，最终在金银潭医院确诊并得到救治。
From the beginning of his discomfort on 24 December 2019, until he was cured and discharged on 15 January, he went through two hospital transfers with a dangerously low blood oxygen content and was eventually diagnosed and treated at the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital.
深一度与王康进行了对话，希望能以他为样本，还原早期新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎患者的发现和治疗过程。
At one point, he held a dialogue with Wang Kang, hoping that he could be used as a model to restore the early detection and treatment of patients with coronavirus infection.
身体越来越好，但消化能力差深一度：现在身体状况怎么样？王康：今天是我出院第6天了，不能干重活，不能运动量过大，但身体一天比一天好了，就是说话有一点气喘吁吁，深呼吸会有一点的困难，普通的、正常呼吸是没问题。
Wang Kang: Today is my sixth day out of the hospital, I can't do heavy work, I can't exercise too much, but my body is getting better day by day.
我家就在武汉，其实现在自己都可以照顾自己，父母也在照顾我。
My home is in Wuhan, in fact now can take care of themselves, parents are also taking care of me.
但我很少出门。
But I seldom go out.
深一度：医生有没有开后续服用的药？王康：医院给的药就两种，有助于胸部活性的和抗流感的，胸部活性的开了4个月的，另外一种抗流感的药，只开了5天。
One degree: Did the doctor prescribe follow-up meds? Wang Kang: The hospital gave two drugs, one for chest activity and one for influenza, the other for five days.
把这一盒吃完就够了，在医院也一直在吃这个药。
Enough of this box. I've been taking this medicine in the hospital.
我今天早上加了一点健胃消食片。
I added a little bit of Gastric Sauvignon this morning.
深一度：肠胃还是不舒服吗？王康：消化功能还是不好。
Deep once: Is stomach still uncomfortable? Wang Kang: Digestive function is still bad.
昨天吃了一点饺子，就胃反酸，胃胀气，到现在还是的。
Yesterday ate a little dumplings, stomach acid, flatulence, to this day is still.
深一度：接下来还有什么后续治疗或检查？王康：我一个月之后还要去做检查，金银潭那边的医生说，如果有什么不对劲的，一定要及时去。
What follow-up treatment or checkWang Kang: I'm going to have an examination in a month, said the doctor on the other side of the gold and silver pool.
那边医院非常负责，医护人员都特别好，我都是想感谢他们，他们很多都是武汉其他医院调过来的医护人员，还有北京的专家，因为人手有限，他们每天也是高负荷运转， 一天工作16个小时，从早工作到晚。
The hospital there is very responsible, the staff are very good, I want to thank them, many of them are from other Wuhan hospitals, and Beijing experts, because of the limited staff, they are also high-load daily operation, working 16 hours a day, from early to late.
协和医院开具的诊断证明以为是感冒，两次转院才确诊深一度：什么时候感觉到身体出问题的？王康：我是12月24号觉得身体有点不对劲，当时的症状是头晕、头痛、四肢无力、四肢酸痛，当时我以为是感冒，因为跟感冒差不多，第二天去上班时，感觉全身软绵绵的，使不上力气。
When did I feel something was wrong with December 24th, when I felt something was wrong with my dizziness, headache, limp limbs and aching limbs. At that time, I thought I had a cold.
我就请假打车回家，去附近一个医院进行治疗。
I took leave to take a taxi home to a nearby hospital for treatment.
25号在医院，当天就打了点滴了，一点没有耽误自己，去了医院就一直输液，当时还没有发烧，过了三天之后，大概27号就连续高烧。
Twenty-five in the hospital, on the same day hit a bit of drip, did not delay themselves, went to the hospital has been infusion, at that time has not had a fever, three days later, about 27 continued high fever.
深一度：那几天你一直在医院吗？王康：不是，就每天去医院输液，输完液就回来，就按照普通的感冒在治。
Once upon a time: Have you been in the hospital for those daysWang Kang: No, I go to the hospital for infusion every day.
后来27号发烧，一直高烧不退，当时一直输液，但症状一点没有好转，反而越来越严重。
Later No. 27 fever, has been high fever, then has been infusion, but symptoms did not improve, but more and more serious.
我几乎动不了了，严重无力。
I can hardly move. I'm so weak.
下来走两步就血氧特别低，呼吸困难，就是要躺着。
Two steps down on the blood oxygen is particularly low, breathing difficulties, is to lie down.
后来就去查血，当时查了个血常规，没有一点问题，是正常的，第二天又查血、查肝功能之类的。
Later went to check blood, then checked a blood routine, no problem, is normal, the next day blood test, liver function and so on.
我大学时胆胺酶就偏高，还专门告诉了医生，因为我不知道有肺炎这个事，当时没有关注这个东西，很怕是什么其他病。
When I was in college, my cholinesterase was high and I told the doctor because I didn't know there was pneumonia. I didn't pay attention to it at that time.
查了之后要再过一天拿结果，结果第二天刚好是周末，我就回家了。
I checked and had another day to get the results, but the next day it was the weekend and I went home.
因为输液没效，就没再继续了，在家躺了两天。
Because the infusion did not work, did not continue, at home for two days.
深一度：那两天状态怎么样？王康：（生病）严重的影响食欲，我吃不了东西，吃了就想吐，基本就喝了点粥，喝了点水。
How about those two daysWangkang: (sick) serious effects on appetite, I can not eat, eat and feel like vomiting, basically drank some porridge, drank some water.
深一度：周一拿到结果怎么样？王康：周一拿到结果后，发现肝功能有一点异常，就以为是肝功能的问题。
How did you get the results on MondayWang Kang: When I got the results on Monday, I found a little abnormality in liver function, which I think is the liver function.
然后就说去协和医院（华中科技大学同济医学院附属协和医院）看看。
Then go to Concorde Hospital (Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology).
我在家休息了几天，1号上午去了协和。
I rested at home for a few days and went to Concorde on the morning of the first.
去医院还在发烧，就买了药，喝了之后就出汗，但继续发烧，一般发烧到39摄氏度，最高烧到40、41摄氏度，吃退烧药退了一些，但一直反复烧，退了又烧起来。
To the hospital is still feverish, bought medicine, drank after sweating, but continue a fever, general fever to 39 degrees Celsius, the highest fever to 40, 41 degrees Celsius, take antipyretics back a little, but have been repeatedly burned, back and burned.
深一度：在协和医院做了什么检查？王康：在协和医院入院后，我去内分泌科做了全身的检查。
At one degree: What was the check-up at Concorde Hospital? Wang Kang: After admission to Concorde Hospital, I went to the Endocrinology Department for a general examination.
1月2号，因为我的血氧浓度已经下降到60%了，快有生命危险。
January 2nd, because my blood oxygen concentration has dropped to 60%, and my life is in danger.
就拍了一个胸片，拍片子的地方和我住院的地方隔着几栋楼，医生只能推着我的床去拍片，一路上医生还叫我妈要不停地跟我说话，不要让我睡过去，因为血氧低了就想睡觉。
A chest film was taken, a few buildings away from where I was hospitalized, the doctor had to push my bed to make a film, and on the way the doctor told my mother to keep talking to me and not to let me sleep because my blood oxygen was low.
那段路上不能用医院的氧气机，只能用氧气瓶，拍完片子后，好像有一个专门的人问我，我在哪里工作，上下班路过什么地方，在哪里住之类的，了解这些信息。
After filming the film, it seemed that a special person asked me where I worked, where I went to and from work, where I lived, and so on.
深一度：你怎么提供这些信息的？王康：我告诉他，我工作在汉口火车站附近做销售，离家比较近，（那个地方离华南海鲜市场直线距离只有几百米），每天骑自行车回家。
Once upon a time: How did you provide this information? Wang Kang: I told him that I worked near Hankou Railway Station, near my home (where the distance from the South China seafood market is only a few hundred meters), and rode my bike home every day.
我没有去过海鲜市场，我大概 22号去逛过华南水果市场，当天下了一点小雨，我没带雨衣雨伞，可能淋了点雨，着了凉，我就认为是感冒，因为肺炎前期症状和感冒基本一模一样。
I have not been to the seafood market, I probably 22 went to South China Fruit Market, when it was a little rain, I did not take a raincoat umbrella, may be drizzled with rain, caught a cold, I think it is cold, because the symptoms of the early pneumonia and the cold are basically the same.
深一度：协和医院那边检查的结果是？王康：1月2日上午11点，就跟我妈说可能要转到金银潭医院，然后我妈就开始整理东西，12点时说可能不用。
Wang Kang: At 11 a.m. on January 2, I told my mother that I might have to transfer to the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital, and then my mother started to tidy up, maybe not at 12: 00.
他们在讨论我的病情，好像还开了视频会议，他们差不多沟通了两个小时。
They were talking about my condition, like they had a videoconference, and they were communicating for almost two hours.
当时我妈特别怕医院不收我，因为她也不知道肺炎这个病，她以为是什么重大疾病，就特别怕。
At that time, my mother was afraid that the hospital would not accept me, because she did not know about pneumonia, she thought it was a major disease, especially afraid.
医生又跟她说，不能让我昏迷，要一直跟我说话，她就更怕了，特别着急。
The doctor told her again that I could not be unconscious, and that she was all the more afraid and anxious to speak to me all the time.
当时我们都不知道金银潭医院是什么医院。
At that time, we did not know what the hospital was.
深一度：后来怎么去了金银潭医院？王康：当天下午正式转院时，有个证明，说高度疑似肺炎。
At one degree: How did he get to the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital? Wang Kang: When the hospital was officially transferred that afternoon, there was a certificate saying it was highly suspected of pneumonia.
大概晚上七点多钟，金银潭医院开救护车来接我，进医院就开始上氧气、测血氧、心电图之类的， 我大概晚上8点40被送到了ICU，进去抽了个血。
About 7 pm, gold and silver pool hospital ambulance to pick me up, into the hospital began to oxygen, blood oxygen, electrocardiogram and so on, I was sent to the ICU about 8: 40 pm, went in to draw blood.
我姐也要冲进去，当时是两个医生、两个保安板把她拦住了。
My sister was about to rush in, too, when she was stopped by two doctors and two security guards.
因为ICU是完全隔离的。
Because the ICU is completely isolated.
然后我又被转到了重症病房，我姐就跟进去了。
Then I was transferred to the intensive care unit and my sister followed.
我这条命多亏我姐细心照料。
I owe my life to my sister's care.
深一度：姐姐做了什么事？王康：因为隔离病人很多，护士忙不过来，我们这种病人高烧不退、没有食欲、血氧低，我姐就是一口饭、一口水地喂，还要给我端屎端尿。
Once upon a time, my sister did something? Wang Kang: Because of the isolation of a lot of patients, nurses are busy, we have high fever, no appetite, low oxygen, my sister is a mouthful of rice, a mouthful of water to feed, but also to carry excrement for me.
医院有给她口罩。
The hospital gave her a mask.
她就陪我住了十几天，在我的床旁边搭了7个凳子，垫着被子，然后盖着那样睡。
She stayed with me for ten days, put up seven stools next to my bed, cushioned myself with quilts, and slept like that.
烧退是到金银潭医院第2天就已经退了。
The burn-out occurred on the second day of the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital.
1号到3号，我姐不停地给我喂水，也一直在吃药，反复发烧，反复出汗，烧降得特别快。
No.1 to No.3, my sister has been feeding me water, has been taking medicine, repeatedly feverish, repeatedly sweating, burning down very fast.
当时我拿杯子手都抬不起来，我躺着，我姐拿吸管喂我，还要把我头扶起来。
When I couldn't lift my hand, I lay down, my sister fed me a straw and lifted my head up.
大概10号，我转病房，那会儿我可以动了，自己能照顾自己了，就让我姐出去了。
About 10, I transferred to the ward, and by that time I could move, take care of myself and let my sister go out.
我外甥病了。
My nephew is ill.
她在这里住了十几天也都没怎么换衣服，因为进来就出不去了。
She had lived here for ten days and had hardly changed her clothes, because she could not get out of the house.
出去时，给她消了毒，然后检查了一下，才放她出去的。
When she went out, she was poisoned and checked before she was allowed out.
我爸妈也陪着我，但是他们毕竟年龄大了，到金银潭的时候就不准他们进了，我姐也不让他们进去，我们全程配合医生。
My parents were with me, but they were too old to let them in when they got to the gold and silver, and my sister wouldn't let them in.
深一度：医生让你们怎么做？王康：医生让我爸去外面去买一点人血白蛋白，因为我几天没吃饭了，没有营养。
Once upon a time: What did the doctor tell you to do? Wang Kang: The doctor asked my father to go outside and buy some human blood albumin, because I hadn't eaten in days and I didn't have any nutrition.
我们住在汉口，我爸去武昌买了5瓶。
We live in Hankou. My father went to Wuchang to buy five bottles.
但当时说隔离的病人没有冷冻设备，人血白蛋白要冰箱冰着，拿过来5瓶，医院只收一瓶，让剩下4瓶拿回去放在冰箱，我家离医院特别远，我妈就在医院外面酒店开了个房，就为了冻这几瓶白蛋白，然后每天给我送一瓶。
But when she said there was no refrigeration equipment for the isolated patients, she took five bottles of human albumin to the refrigerator, one bottle to the hospital, and four bottles to the fridge. My house was so far from the hospital that my mother opened a room outside the hospital to freeze the albumin bottles and then gave me a bottle every day.
一瓶500多，大概就50毫升或者75毫升，反正蛮小一瓶，黄颜色的。
More than 500 bottles, about 50 milliliters or 75 milliliters, it's a small one, yellow one anyway.
五天以后，我就能吃饭了，可以自己吸收营养，就不需要它了。
In five days, I will be able to eat, can absorb nutrition on their own, do not need it.
王康在金银潭医院重症病房拍摄的照片 从输液十几瓶到可以下床走动深一度：医生是怎么治疗的呢？有告诉你什么方案？王康：这个病它没有特效药，没有快速的解决办法，只能激活你人体自身的免疫功能去对抗病毒，它会对其他的脏器官造成损伤。
The photos Wang took in the intensive care unit of the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital ranged from a dozen bottles of infusion to a depth of one degree: How did the doctor treat it? Wang Kang: It has no specific medicine, there is no quick solution, it can only activate your own immune function to anti-virus, it will damage other organ officials.
就那边的医护人员、医生、护士都挺好的，他打什么药，都会跟你说这个是干嘛的。
The paramedics, the doctors, the nurses over there are all good, and whatever drugs he takes, he'll tell you what this is for.
输液，还有打那种消炎、退烧之类的，主要是激活肺部活性。
Infusion, but also hit that kind of anti-inflammatory, reduce fever and so on, mainly to activate lung activity.
他们还说要打护胃、护肝的药，保护各种器官，特别是肠胃。
They also said that they should protect the stomach, liver medicine, protect various organs, especially the stomach.
其他的还是针对肺炎的，我不是很懂具体是什么。
The others are for pneumonia. I don't know exactly what it is.
深一度：所以你在入院以后基本上是输液的方式吗？王康：对，输液。
Once upon a time: So are you basically an infusion after admission? Wang Kang: Yes, infusion.
输得好多，前面几天每天都是十几瓶，到8号、9号就是（每天）8瓶左右。
Losing a lot, the first few days are a dozen bottles, to the 8th, 9th is (every day) about 8 bottles.
有时会开点药，但是医生叫你停就得停，叫你吃你就吃。
Sometimes medicine is prescribed, but the doctor tells you to stop, and you eat.
要完全的配合。
You need to cooperate fully.
也会换药。
You can change it, too.
我也不懂具体换的啥，就是说激活肺部活性。
I don't know what I'm talking about, Which means activating lung activity.
深一度：后来为什么减药了？王康：因为慢慢的我的血氧可以到90了，他们开始给我减氧气的浓度和流速，我的心率正常了，血压什么都正常以后，就把我的氧气摘掉，把我的心电图摘掉。
Once upon a time, my heart rate was normal, my blood pressure was normal, so I took off my oxygen and took off my electrocardiogram (ECG).
我觉得主要是因为我年轻，我才23岁，全身的器官都在帮我。
I think it's mainly because I'm young, I'm 23, and all my organs are helping me.
深一度：这次生病对你肠胃损伤很严重吗？王康：怎么说呢，我到协和的时候，第一天我爸给我买的武汉的一种早餐叫烧麦，里面有一点胡椒。
Wangkang: Well, when I arrived at Concorde, the first day my father bought me a kind of Wuhan breakfast called barbecue, with a little pepper in it.
我原来一点都不怕辣，吃火锅都没什么。
I was not afraid of the spicy, hot pot is nothing.
但当时就吃了一小口烧卖，就有一点胡椒，我整个食道、胃一上午就特别难受。
But I ate a little bit of it and there was a bit of pepper. My whole esophagus and stomach felt terrible all morning.
还有我在床上上厕所，小便还好，可以闷着，大便的话，在床上我觉得特别丢人，就憋了5天。
And I go to the bathroom in bed, urine is good, can be stuffy, stool, I feel particularly humiliated in bed, I can hold for five days.
从进协和第1天开始就没有上过。
Not since day one of the Concorde.
到5、6号才开始，把那些心电图拔下来，才走进去，那里有一个坐便器，可以坐着。
It wasn't until May or 6th that the electrocardiograms were pulled out and they went in. There was a toilet seat that could sit.
那时候开始有大便出血的情况，我以为是什么痔疮之类的，但不是的，是因为肠道损伤，再加上我5天没有排便，就肛门就破裂了。
I thought it was hemorrhoids or something like that, but it wasn't because of intestinal damage and the fact that I didn't defecate for five days and my anus broke.
当时特别惨，我实在憋不住了，但我不愿意在床上，当时就把氧气拔了，然后要护士给我把心电图也摘下去，然后慢慢走，走一步就剧烈咳嗽。
It was a terrible time, but I didn't want to be in bed. I pulled out the oxygen and asked the nurse to take the ECG off, then walked slowly and coughed violently.
因为我其实不能下床，稍微一动剧烈的咳嗽，根本就呼吸不了，上卫生间很短的一段距离，走过去就花了五分钟，在里面也一直咳嗽，不停地咳，但不能用力。
Because I couldn't get out of bed, coughed so hard that I couldn't breathe. I had a short walk to the bathroom and spent five minutes, coughing and coughing, but I couldn't force it.
深一度：为什么转了病房？王康：10号之前就是来一个住一个，好像只有重症和ICU的两种。
Once upon a time: Why did you turn to the ward? Wang Kang: Before the 10th, there was only one living, as if there were only severe cases and ICU.
ICU就是完全隔离的，那是有生命危险的。
The ICU is totally isolated. It's life-threatening.
因为人越来越多，病房不够了，要把重症的和轻症的分离开，当时我已经快好了，但我还是重症的，武汉当时只有金银潭疾控中心收不明肺炎病人。
As more and more people, the ward is not enough, to leave the severe and mild disease, I was almost done, but I was still seriously ill, Wuhan at the time only gold and silver pool CDC patients unknown pneumonia.
我是10号转到了另外一个重症病房。
I'm on the 10th and transferred to another intensive care unit.
当时我已经能在屋子里自己来回走动了，还可以自己倒水、自己洗澡，几乎什么都能做。
I was able to walk around the house myself, pour my own water, bathe myself, and do almost anything.
深一度：和你同一间重症病房里都是什么人？王康：我后面转到重症病房，当时加我4个人，其他三个人，一个是62岁的一个爹爹、68岁的一个婆婆、42岁的一个壮年男子。
Once upon a time: Who were they in the same intensive care unit as yoursWang Kang: I went behind to the intensive care unit, where I was joined by four people, three others, a 62-year-old father, a 68-year-old mother-in-law, and a 42-year-old man.
我在这里住了五天就出院了，那几天，他们三个基本没吃东西，又没人照顾，护士帮他们喂饭的时候，他们也吃不进去，因为医院的饭菜虽然很有营养，但刚开始去的时候，第一天伙食不太好，第二天就特别的好，牛羊肉、鸡鸭鱼肉都有，很均衡，酸奶、水果也都有。
I stayed here for five days before I was discharged from the hospital, where the three of them barely ate or were left to fend for themselves. They were unable to eat while the nurse fed them, for although the food was nutritious, the first day was not very good and the next day was particularly good.
但是他们还是吃不进去。
But they couldn't eat it.
出院后感觉越来越好深一度：你什么时候觉得自己基本上算好起来了？王康：我能动了就感觉好了，慢慢感觉越来越好。
When did you think you were basically better? Wang Kang: I feel better when I can move and feel better and better over time.
后来在医院里面都没怎么咳嗽了。
I didn't cough much in the hospital.
深一度：医生是怎么通知你该出院的？王康：13号，我做了检查和胸部CT，还抽了血，医生是14号通知我的，打完针之后他通知我的，说我胸部状态特别好，叫我家人15号来。
How did the doctor inform you that you should be discharged from the hospital Wang Kang: Thirteen, I had a check-up and a chest CT, and I had blood on my chest.
医生叫我不要去人多的地方，要静养、按时吃药。
The doctor told me not to go to crowded places, but to keep quiet and take medicine on time.
深一度：出院感觉怎么样？王康：我是中午出的院，当时我特别想吃热干面，太久没吃了，然后就走着去吃热干面了，吃了半碗。
At one point: How did it feel to be discharged from the hospital? Wang Kang: I was out of the hospital at noon, and I wanted to eat hot, dry noodles for a long time.
当时可以自己走，但走不快，刚出院时走几步，腿上的肌肉还会抽筋，腿没有什么力气，我妈妈那么大岁数了，她走的都比我快。
I was able to walk on my own, but I couldn't walk fast. I walked a few steps when I left the hospital. I still had cramps in my legs and my legs were not strong.
其实我没有自我感觉良好，包括出院之后都感觉不是很好，因为我躺在床上差不多有超过20天的时间了，躺太久了，没有什么运动量。
I didn't feel good about myself, either, including after I was discharged from the hospital, because I was in bed for almost 20 days, lying too long and not doing much exercise.
出院第二天我强迫自己出去走走，在家附近逛了一下，我爸我妈都特别担心，不准我出去，一直催着我回家。
The next day I forced myself out for a walk around the house. My father and my mother were so worried that I wasn't allowed out and kept pushing me home.
然后发现我下午回来之后情况比第一天好多了， 体力变好了，慢慢走路也能快点了。
Then I found that I came back in the afternoon better than the first day, physical strength improved, slowly walking can also be faster.
也没有那么累了。
I'm not that tired.
深一度：现在状态如何？王康：身上是越来越有力，还挺好的，消化不太行之外。
Deep once: How is the state? Wang Kang: The body is more and more powerful, but also good, digestion is not very good outside.
不能跑步但是说走路可以走很长时间。
Can't run but can walk for a long time.
但是就很容易感伤，很容易流泪。
But it's easy to be sentimental, easy to cry.
因为家里人其实非常担心，我妈妈60多岁了，之前天天在家里哭。
Because the family is really worried, my mother is in her sixties, and used to cry at home every day.
我四个舅舅，两个小姨一个姨妈都挺关心我，邻居也很关心我。
My four uncles and two aunts cared about me, and the neighbors cared about me.
我好了之后，每个人都来送东西，送牛奶、送钱的，都来看我。
When I was well, everyone came to see me, the milkman, the money giver.
我生病的时候，我朋友去协和看我，但是医生不让他进。
When I was ill, my friend went to Concorde to see me, but the doctor wouldn't let him in.
他在玻璃门外面看了一眼，就自己跑到楼上去哭。
He looked outside the glass door and ran upstairs to cry.
深一度：你姐姐照顾你，身体没问题吧？王康：她出来了之后有感冒，我叫她快点去医院检查一下，她去了， 就是感冒。
Wang Kang: She came out with a cold, and I told her to go to the hospital quickly to have a check-up.
深一度：医生跟你说你是肺炎的时候，你有意识到这个病比较严重吗？王康：我都不怎么玩手机，当时朋友说我，我可能是这个病，我说应该不会这么倒霉的。
Once upon a time, when the doctor told you that you had pneumonia, were you aware that the disease was serious? Wang Kang: I didn't play much with mobile phones.
说实话我是好了之后，在家里看新闻，才意识到这个病的严重性，有种劫后余生的感觉。
To tell you the truth, I was good after watching the news at home, only to realize the seriousness of the disease, a sense of survival.
住院的时候，我一直认为还好，就是一个病，因为我从小到大没有住过院。
When I was in hospital, I always thought it was okay. It was a sickness because I had never been in a hospital since I was a kid.
深一度：整个治疗过程花了多少钱？王康：一共花了2万多，在协和花了1万多，到了金银潭基本没收什么钱，就收了3000块押金和300的饭钱，后面都没收我们的费用。
At one degree: How much did the whole treatment costWangkang: More than 20,000 yuan, more than 10,000 yuan in Concorde, and then basically confiscated money in the gold and silver pool.
