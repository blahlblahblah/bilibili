记者/李佳楠 实习记者/李一鸣编辑/宋建华疾控工作人员去医院采集检测样本1月30日，人民日报官微发布天津市第28例患者4次检测确诊的情况，“有患者4次检测才确诊”的话题登上热搜，网友感叹病毒狡猾。
Reporter / Li Jiangnan intern reporter / Li Yiming editor / Song Jianhua CDC staff went to the hospital to collect test samples January 30, People's Daily officials micro-issued a diagnosis of Tianjin 28 patients four times, "patients only confirmed by four tests," the topic boarded hot search, netizens lament the virus cunning.
深一度发现，除第28例患者外，天津第16例患者经过三次检测才确诊。
At one point, with the exception of the twenty-eighth case, Tianjin patient was diagnosed after three tests.
天津之外，杭州、珠海也出现了多例类似病例，甚至有的病例在发病第6天才出现阳性检测结果的情况。
In addition to Tianjin, Hangzhou and Zhuhai also have a number of similar cases, and some cases of positive test results on the 6th day of the onset of the disease.
1月28日，在给省卫健委专家组的情况汇报中，中山大学附属第五医院建议：“对流行病学史明确，胸部CT影像学支持病毒性肺炎的疑似病例，至少按照10天隔离，样本检测不能局限于两次阴性结果就解除隔离”。
On 28 January, in a debriefing to the Provincial Health Commission Expert Group, Zhongshan University Affiliated Hospital No. 5 recommended that "the epidemiological history is clear and CT imaging of the chest supports suspected cases of viral pneumonia, with isolation for at least 10 days and sample testing not limited to two negative results."
李兰娟（左）、曹志新（中）、苏旭（右）接受深一度采访多地数个病例，早期检测呈阴性深一度记者梳理发现，天津市疾控中心和卫健委发布的疫情信息显示，近日，天津市确诊的第16例和28例两名病例，出现首次核酸检测为阴性的情况，经多次检测后，核酸检测结果最终为阳性。
Li Lanjuan (left), Cao Zhixin (middle), Su Xu (right) were interviewed at one time in depth. Early detection of negative deep-one reporter carding found that Tianjin CDC and the health committee released the information that recently, Tianjin City diagnosed the 16th case and 28 cases, the first nucleic acid test negative, after repeated tests, the nucleic acid test results ultimately positive.
第16例是78岁的陈某某，为第5例病例的亲属，系密切接触者，于1月21日出现发热，1月23日、24日两次到天津市第四中心医院就诊，核酸检测均为阴性，采取居家隔离措施。
The 16th case is 78-year-old Chen, a relative of the fifth case, who developed fever on January 21 and visited Tianjin Central Hospital No. 4 twice on January 23 and 24. Nucleic acid testing was negative and isolation measures were taken.
1月26日再次核酸检测为阳性，经市专家组确诊为重症病例，转至天津定点医院海河医院治疗。
January 26 nucleic acid testing positive, confirmed by the municipal expert group as a serious case, referred to Tianjin Dingdian Hospital Haihe Hospital for treatment.
第28例患者为天津铁路动车客车段职工，与本单位多名新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎患者为密切接触者。
The twenty-eighth patient was a staff member of Tianjin railway locomotive and bus section. He was in close contact with several patients with pneumonia infected by the new coronavirus.
1月19日出现发热，1月25日就诊于天津市第四中心医院，两次核酸检测阴性，予以居家隔离。
Fever developed on 19 January, and on 25 January he was admitted to Tianjin City Central Hospital No. 4, where he tested negative for two nucleic acid tests and was placed in isolation.
1月27日再次发热，1月28日核酸检测阴性，1月30日第四次检测为阳性，为普通型病例，转至海河医院治疗。
January 27 fever again, January 28 Nucleic acid negative, January 30 a fourth positive test, for ordinary cases, referred to Haihe hospital for treatment.
天津疾控中心病原生物检测室主任苏旭参与了患者实验室检测确诊工作，他向深一度讲述了两名患者的检测过程。
Su Xu, director of the pathogen bioassay unit at the Tianjin CDC, was involved in the patient's laboratory test and confirmed the diagnosis.
苏旭介绍，1月23日晚，与第16例患者同时送来的另一患者样本一次检测为阳性，陈某某却很难判定，直至24日凌晨，陈某某的样本经过三遍检测，按照标准判定应为阴性，但与一般阴性样本稍有不同，有一点点小的扩张曲线，有阳性倾向。
On the night of January 23, another patient brought in with the 16th patient tested positive, but Chen was difficult to determine. Chen's sample was tested three times in the early hours of January 24 and found to be negative according to the standard, but slightly different from the general negative sample, with a small dilatation curve and a positive tendency.
1月24日，苏旭要求采样人员再次上门采样，检测结果与上次相同，判定为阴性。
On January 24, Su Xu asked the samplers to take samples again, and the results were negative.
苏旭表示，按照国家规范，第一次检测为阴性，需要至少隔一日进行二次检测。
The first test is negative and requires at least a second test every other day, according to state regulations, Su said.
因为前两次检测时间相隔较短，加之注意到该病例的特殊性，决定进行再次检测。
Due to the short interval between the first two tests, and taking into account the special nature of the case, it was decided to conduct a second test.
1月25日之后，天津疾控方案调整，检测下放到下辖各区疾控。
After January 25, Tianjin CDC program adjustment, testing under the jurisdiction of disease control.
1月26日，天津市河北区疾控对陈某某样本检测，结果最终呈阳性。
January 26, Tianjin Hebei District CDC test Chen so-and-so samples, the results were positive.
对于第28例病例，苏旭介绍，前三次都是按照规范的采样时间，由河北区疾控检测为阴性，第四次检测最终确认为阳性，天津市疾控进行了复核。
For the first 28 cases, Su Xu said, the first three cases were tested negative according to the standard sampling time, while the fourth test was positive.
与第16例不同，从检测报告来看，前两次采样时，第28例患者是新冠肺炎感染或是其他感染都有可能。
In contrast to the 16th case, the first two samples showed the possibility of coronal pneumonia infection or other infection in the first two cases.
中山大学附属第五医院也报告发现部分疑似病例，在出现发热等症状后，核酸检测早期为阴性，后期逐渐出现阳性，甚至有发病第六天才出现阳性结果的病例。
Zhongshan University Annex V Hospital also reported a number of suspected cases, after fever and other symptoms, Nucleic Acid testing early negative, later gradually positive, and even the sixth day of the onset of positive results.
该院收治的一名49岁湖北籍患者，此前长期在武汉肿瘤中心医院照顾生病的丈夫，1月18日，从武汉飞回珠海。
A 49-year-old Hubei patient admitted to the hospital had flown back to Zhuhai from Wuhan on January 18 after taking care of her sick husband at Wuhan Tumor Central Hospital.
1月22日，出现头痛、发热症状。
On 22 January, headache and fever developed.
发病第二日入院检查，肺部CT双肺下叶病变，当日核酸检测为阴性。
On the second day of admission, lung CT subpulmonary lobe lesions, Nucleic acid test was negative.
发病第四日，检测结果为弱阳性（医院检测为阴性）。
On the fourth day of the disease, the test results were weak positive (negative hospital test).
发病第六日，疾控中心报告检测结果为阳性。
On the sixth day of the disease, the CDC reported positive results.
此外，国家卫健委高级别专家组成员、中国工程院院士李兰娟向深一度证实，杭州也出现了几例类似病例。
Li Lanjuan, a member of the high-level group of experts of the National Fitness and Health Commission and a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, confirmed several similar cases in Hangzhou.
中山大学第五医院的情况汇报、人民日报官微的发布消息阴性期间排毒量少，传染风险小对于少数病例早期为阴性，后期逐渐出现阳性的问题，曾参与过SARS会诊的北京市朝阳医院西院呼吸与危重症医学科副主任曹志新表示，在新冠肺炎的诊断中，最主要的混杂因素是呼吸道分泌物的排毒量。
Cao Zhixin, deputy director of respiratory and critical medicine at the western hospital of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, who had participated in SARS consultation, said that the main confounding factor in the diagnosis of new crown pneumonia was the volume of respiratory secretions.
对于绝大部分病人来说，现在用的实时免疫荧光法核酸检测的敏感度是非常高的，都能单次检测呈阳性。
For the vast majority of patients, the current use of real-time immunofluorescence detection of nucleic acid sensitivity is very high, can be a single test positive.
如果持续检测都是阴性，高概率是该名病人每次呼吸道排毒的量非常少，所以不容易检测出来，从传染病防控角度讲，有可能该患者潜在的传染风险反而相对较小。
If continuous testing is negative, the high probability is that the patient will detoxify each respiratory tract in such a way that it is not easy to detect and, from the point of view of infectious disease control, it is possible that the potential infectious risk for the patient is relatively small.
当然，只要是新冠肺炎，不管怎样，患者都必须接受隔离治疗。
Of course, as long as it is new crown pneumonia, the patient must be treated in isolation anyway.
国家卫健委高级别专家组成员、中国工程院院士李兰娟对深一度表示，杭州也有几个类似病例，早期的时候，肺部的病变比较周边，不一定有痰，或痰内没有病毒，所以检测不出来，后期才能检测出来。
Li Lanjuan, a member of the National Fitness and Health Commission and a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, told Shenzhen at one time that there were several similar cases in Hangzhou.
早期检测不出来的病人病症较轻，肺部炎症还在边缘。
Patients who are not detected early have mild symptoms, and inflammation of the lungs is still on the verge.
“这种情况不可怕，检测不出来，也就是不具有传染性，只有病毒在肺里繁殖后，喷出物检测呈阳性，才具有传染性。
"It's not scary, it's not detectable, it's not contagious, it's only infectious if the virus reproduces in the lungs and the ejecta tests positive.
”李兰娟说。
'said Li Lanjuan.
与第28例患者不同，天津第16例确诊病例被诊断为重症患者，对此，曹志新表示，虽是重症病人，但并不能确定是新冠肺炎本身特别重，还是新冠肺炎致使原有的基础疾病加重，这两种情况的临床意义不一样。
Cao Zhixin, a 16-case confirmed case in Tianjin who was diagnosed as critically ill, said Cao Zhixin said that although the patient was seriously ill, it was not certain that the new crown pneumonia itself was particularly severe or that the new crown pneumonia had aggravated the underlying disease, both of which had different clinical significance.
“考虑到第16例病例已78岁，一般情况下，70岁以上的老人有基础病的比例超过50%，在看不到原始病历的情况下，无法对不尽相同的两种情况作出判断。
"Taking into account the fact that the sixteenth case is 78 years of age, in general the proportion of people over 70 years of age who have basic illnesses exceeds 50 per cent and it is impossible to judge two different cases without having access to the original medical records.
”曹志新说。
"said Cao.
新冠病毒检测室内景结合临床，不轻易排除阴性患者对于这一情况，会不会影响之后病例的确诊，曹志新表示，在全国防控的布局上，严格参照国家卫健委的诊疗指南进行，最多两次阴性就能排除，适用于全国绝大多数病人。
The new crown virus detection indoor scene combines the clinical, does not rule out the feminine patient easily regarding this situation, can affect the subsequent case diagnosis, Cao Zhixin, in the national control layout, strictly according to the National Health Commission diagnosis and treatment guidelines, the maximum two negative can be excluded, applicable to the vast majority of patients.
曹志新认为，在检测能力有限的情况下，要用最小的个案检测代价，来尽可能检测所有的疑似人群。
Cao Zhixin believes that in the case of limited detection capacity, with the lowest case detection cost, to detect as many suspected people as possible.
如果强求确诊面最大化，所有病人的检测总量会是一个大的惊人的数字。
If we were to force maximization of the diagnosis, the total number of tests for all patients would be a large and startling number.
显然，这样做会反过来影响现在的整体防控，即每个病人都测多次是测不过来的，反而是很糟糕的事情。
Obviously, this in turn will affect the overall control of the present, that is, each patient is measured many times is not measured, but is very bad things.
此外，是否多次检测，各个医院可以结合临床，在合理范围内把控，不能机械地完全照搬。
In addition, whether to test more than one time, each hospital can combine clinical, control in reasonable scope, cannot mechanically copy completely.
对于新冠患者的确诊，苏旭告诉深一度，目前为了避免病人的漏诊，国家结合全国的情况在不停的调整方案，包括采样、送检、检测的方案，检测方案相对调整较小。
In order to avoid missed diagnosis, the state is constantly adjusting the programme, including sampling, delivery, testing and testing, to avoid missed diagnosis, SuXu told reporters.
他表示，如果病人符合疑似病例标准，即使是检测为阴性，临床医生也不能直接进行排除。
If the patient meets the criteria for a suspected case, even if the test is negative, the clinician cannot rule it out, he said.
只要临床提出需求，天津疾控一定会配合进行检测。
As long as clinical requirements, Tianjin disease control will cooperate with the testing.
根据天津市卫健委通报梳理，该市确诊的第2例、第5例、第6例、第8例、第17例、第20例、第22例、第28例确诊患者为天津动车客车段职工；第11例、第12例、第13例、第16例患者为该客车段职工家属。
The second, fifth, sixth, eighth, seventeenth, twentieth, twenty-second and twenty-eighth confirmed cases in Tianjin were confirmed to be workers in the train section of Tianjin, while the 11th, 12th, 13th and 16th cases were the dependents of the employees in the bus section.
天津卫健委官网消息，天津动车客运段乘务车间出现聚集性发病，有关部门连夜对该车间采取封控措施，对该车间密切接触人员实施医学观察。
Tianjin health officials reported that the passenger section of Tianjin EMV passenger workshop cluster illness, the relevant departments have taken overnight measures to seal the workshop, close contacts of the workshop to carry out medical observation.
对第16例和第28例病例的多次检测，曹志新表示，诊疗方案中有聚集性病例的概念，意味着有相对密切接触关系的一群人先后发病，可能是人传人的，流行病学意义比一般仅有疫区接触史的人更为重要。
Cao Zhixin, who tested multiple times for the 16th and 28th cases, said the concept of "concentrated cases" in the diagnosis and treatment programme meant that a group of people with relatively close contacts became ill one at a time, possibly from person to person, and that epidemiology was more important than people with a history of exposure only to epidemic areas.
因此，个案情况下，如果是检测呈阴性又有临床表现，多次检测是科学的。
Therefore, in individual cases, if the test is negative and there are clinical manifestations, multiple tests are scientific.
对于人们担忧的在多次检测过程中传染的问题，曹志新表示，只要是被检测的人员，就会按照密切接触者或疑似病例来处理，都是被隔离的，检测过程中感染的概率几乎是没有的。
Cao Zhixin, who says people who have been tested are treated according to close contacts or suspected cases, are isolated and the risk of infection during testing is virtually non-existent, said Cao.
