从社会心态角度来看，人们在疫情爆发前往往胆子太大，疫情爆发后期又往往胆子偏小。
From a social mindset, people tend to be too bold before an outbreak, and are often bolder later in the outbreak.
目前，武汉离黄金交叉点也不远了。
At present, Wuhan is not far from the golden intersection.
现在应大胆一些，加快返工复产文|《财经》数据研究员 徐进图|《财经》视觉中心编辑|谢丽容一、累计确诊病例截至2月19日24:00，全国累计报告确诊新冠肺炎病例74576例。
Now is the time to be bold and accelerate rework & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & nbsp; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & #
以下为分区趋势图。
The following is the zoning trend chart.
图1国内非湖北地区趋势线已现平顶，最终累计病例大概率不会超过12700例。
Fig. 1 The trend line of non-Hubei area in China is flat, and the probability of total cases will not exceed 12,700.
二、新增病例：武汉完成拉网排查，国内非湖北地区接近零新增，现阶段应大胆加快有序复工图2 2月19日，湖北以外所有省区当日新增病例都已降到个位数水平，其中16个省市区为零增长，比昨天增加两个。
The number of new cases dropped to single digits in all provinces and autonomous regions except Hubei province on Feb. 19, with 16 provinces and municipalities showing zero growth, two more than yesterday.
今天降至45例，平均每省不到1.5例，更加接近零新增，与我们此前预测完全吻合。
Today it is down to 45, with an average of less than 1.5 cases per province, which is closer to zero growth and is fully in line with our previous projections.
基于这样的趋势，我们认为应该大胆加快返工复产！有网友问为什么“基本归零”要改为“趋零”？是为了更严谨。
Based on this trend, we believe that we should be bold to speed up the rework! Some netizens asked why the "basic zero" should be changed to "zero"?
几天前的“数说”有解释，不再赘述。
The "counting theory" of a few days ago is explained and will not be repeated.
今天主要讲讲为什么现阶段我们明确呼吁“大胆加快返工复产”。
Today, let's focus on why at this stage we explicitly call for "bold and accelerated rework".
普遍认为“返工复产潮”隐藏着巨大风险，呼吁“大胆加快返工复产”是不是盲目乐观？首先跟大家一起算算数：根据已有统计数据做趋势推测，本月20日以后，国内非湖北地区未来14天也即2月21日-3月5日，累计新增病例为26例（实际情况会在26附近随机偏差，服从正态分布）。
It is widely believed that the "rework recovery tide" hides great risks and calls for "boldly speeding up rework and rework."
为简化起见，假设这26人都是现在（而不是散布在现在及未来若干天）已经带毒者（属较糟情况），按广大非湖北地区13.3亿人口计算也就是每1亿人里有2个病毒携带者。
For the sake of simplification, assume that all 26 are now (not scattered now and for a few days) already infected (a worse case), that is, two per 100 million people out of a total non-Hubei population of 1.33 billion.
我们再假定，很不幸这2个人没有被列入密切接触者名单，也没有在现有疑似病例中（其实这也是比较糟的情况，后面解释），因此没被隔离，将加入“”返工潮。
We further assume that, unfortunately, the two individuals are not on the list of persons in close contact, nor are they in existing suspected cases (which is worse, as explained later) and are therefore not segregated.
我们再进一步假定，2月21日起有1亿人因返工潮移动起来，在途3天，到达目的地。
We further assume that, starting on 21 February, 100 million people will move in waves and reach their destination on three days' journey.
而其中这2个病毒携带者不仅还没有出现症状，还很不幸不知不觉以R0方式在3天旅途中传染扩散，带毒人数变成18人（应该也是比较糟的旅途防护情况）。
These two carriers of the virus not only did not show symptoms, but unfortunately unknowingly spread in R0 mode over a three-day journey, turning the number of people with the virus into 18 (and probably the worst form of travel protection).
那么2月24日对于一个接受1000万人口的目的地城市来说，大概会接收到2个病毒携带者。
So February 24 will probably have two carriers of the virus in a destination city of 10 million people.
等待这2个病毒携带者的是什么呢？是政府和社区层层严防死守；是戴口罩的同事和其他戴口罩的同胞；是他们刚一出现症状就会立即被隔离，他们的密切接触者也会被立即追踪隔离的防控体系。
What is waiting for the two carriers of the virus? Government and community layers of security; masked colleagues and other masked compatriots; isolation as soon as they appear, and their close contacts immediately tracked down the containment system.
所以不难得出结论：1）返工潮引发新一轮传播的风险已经很小；2）一旦发生也完全可控。
So it is not difficult to conclude that: 1) the risk of a new wave of transmission is already low; 2) once it occurs, it is completely controllable.
因此返工复产是安全的！值得指出的是，最近14天非湖北地区新增病例4192 例，新纳入密切追踪者名单183254 人，防控力度达到空前的48。
Therefore, the rework is safe! It is worth pointing out that in the past 14 days, 4,192 new cases were recorded in non-Hubei areas, bringing the total number of newly followed-up cases to 183,254, a record 48.
前面说的未来26位病毒携带者有非常大可能已被囊括在这18万人当中并随他们被隔离观察，无法加入“返工潮”。
The 26 future carriers are most likely to have been included and quarantined, unable to join the return movement.
所以，“返工潮”实际发生扩大传播的概率比前面估算的还要低很多。
So the probability of a return wave actually spreading is much lower than previously estimated.
为什么不仅可以返工还要“加快返工”呢？除了经济恢复有迫切需要，更因为此时正值社会防控意识和防控手段处于高峰，此时“加快”肯定比将来都松弛下来时再“加快”更安全。
Why not just rework and "speed up rework"? In addition to the urgent need for economic recovery, it is certainly safer to "accelerate" at a time when social control awareness and prevention methods are at their peak than when they will all relax in the future.
刚才提到，现在是强隔离。
As mentioned earlier, there is strong isolation.
隔离换来了未来14天更低的传染概率，却严重打断了18万人的正常生活，这是他们为社会付出的代价。
Isolation, in return for a lower probability of infection for the next 14 days, has severely disrupted the lives of 180,000 people at the cost of society.
他们扛着闸门，我们更该珍惜机会，利用这个机会“加快”返工复产。
They carry the floodgates, and we should take advantage of this opportunity to "accelerate" rework.
为什么还要加个“大胆”？因为现在普遍偏胆小了。
Why add "boldness"? Because now it is common to be timid.
从社会心态说，疫情爆发前往往胆太大，疫情爆发后又往往胆偏小。
From the social mentality, often before the outbreak of the epidemic too bold, and often after the outbreak of the small.
今年春节前从湖北集中涌出省外的病毒携带者绝对不少于数千人，是现在带病毒人数的数百倍，而当时的社会完全没有丝毫警觉，恰逢春节社交高峰期，大家照吃照喝，各种聚会。
Before the Spring Festival, no fewer than a few thousand people from Hubei province gathered to carry the virus. This is hundreds of times the number of people living with the virus.
随后疫情爆发，新增病例每隔几天就会倍增。
The outbreak then erupted, with new cases doubling every few days.
多数人带上口罩，或以宅为主。
Most people wear masks, or are predominantly housebound.
今天，经过防控体系全面启动，新增病例逐日下降，疫情实际R值已从远远大于1被降到远远小于1，两者岂可同日而语？形象一点说，春节前的数千病毒携带者是拿着火炬跑到各地，而各地人们都毫无戒备，因此大火迅速燎原。
Today, as a result of the comprehensive control system, the number of new cases is decreasing day by day, and the actual R value of the epidemic has been reduced from well over 1 to far less than 1.
如今十几个病毒携带者冒着百般阻隔带着火星儿到各地，人们都瞪大眼睛一眨不眨地盯着他们，随时将火苗扑灭，再浇上三遍水。
Today, a dozen carriers of the virus venture across the country with sparks, staring at them with wide-eyed stares, extinguishing the flames at any time and dousing them three times.
能一样吗？我们认为，变数最大的倒是在途期间。
Can it be the same? We believe that the biggest variable is during the journey.
旅途时间越长发生传播的概率越高。
The longer the journey, the higher the probability of transmission.
所以加快复工的同时，还要注意尽可能缩短交通时间，做好旅途防护，降低风险。
Therefore, to speed up the resumption of work, but also to pay attention to the shortest possible traffic time, travel protection, risk reduction.
图32月19日湖北非武汉地区新增病例降至负数，是因为出现较大比例核减。
Fig. 32 The negative number of new cases occurred in non-Wuhan area of Hubei Province on 19 July because of the large proportion of nuclear reduction.
因为其公布的很可能是净增（减）数，我们暂时给出推测的18、19日新增病例数（如图中蓝色推测的数据所示）。
Since it is likely to show a net increase (decrease), we give a tentative estimate of the number of new cases on the 18th and 19th days (as shown in the figure in blue).
图4武汉新增陡降至615例，结合其他数据和有关报道，判断很可能是武汉全面落实五个“百分之百”战役基本成功的标志。
Fig. 4 Wuhan added a new steep decline to 615 cases, combined with other data and related reports, judge that Wuhan is likely to fully implement the five "100%" campaign basic success marks.
三、确诊病例增长率：全国武汉以外地区已降至0.5%以下，武汉进一步降到2%以下。
The growth rate of confirmed cases has been reduced to less than 0.5 percent in areas outside Wuhan and to less than 2 percent in Wuhan.
图5国内非湖北地区增长率降至0.34%。
Figure 5 Domestic non-Hubei growth rate fell to 0.34 per cent.
，湖北非武汉地区调整数据待观察。
The adjustment of data in Hubei non-Wuhan area is to be observed.
武汉增速陡降。
Wuhan growth rate plummeted.
四、密切接触者追踪：非湖北地区追踪力度持续加大，湖北有所上升，值得期待图6国内非湖北地区该项指标持续提升，显示彻底阻隔传染的强大能力和决心。
Close Contacts Tracing: Tracking efforts in non-Hubei areas have continued to increase and Hubei has increased. It is worth looking forward to the continuous improvement of this indicator in non-Hubei areas of China in Fig. 6, showing a strong ability and determination to completely stop the infection.
如果计算最近一周的数据，则平均追踪系数约为 70人。
If data for the most recent week are calculated, the average tracking factor is about 70.
湖北这个指标连日持续爬升，考虑到武汉“五个百分之百”战役（其中包括密切追踪者百分之百隔离）尚未收尾，这种变化实在来之不易！图7湖北尚在接受医学观察者存量数据继续下降，显示疫情趋缓。
Hubei this indicator continues to climb day by day, considering Wuhan "five hundred percent" campaign (which includes 100 percent quarantine of close pursuers) has not come to an end, this change is hard to come by!
国内非湖北地区继续明显下降，意味着可以释放更多资源投入到新的密切接触者追踪上（如果真需要的话）。
The continued marked decline in non-Hubei areas of the country means that more resources can be freed up for new close contacts (if needed).
五、疑似病例：新增减少、存量下降图8湖北（含武汉）新增疑似病例较昨日回升近300例，应属武汉五个百分百成果。
Figure 8 The number of new suspected cases in Hubei province, including Wuhan, rose by nearly 300 from yesterday and should be attributed to Wuhan.
图9疑似病例存量都在下降。
Figure 9 shows a declining stock of suspected cases.
六、在院治疗人数：武汉收治能力提升图10湖北在院治疗人数仍有上升。
The number of people treated in the hospital: Wuhan treatment capacity improvement Figure 10 Hubei hospital treatment number is still on the rise.
鉴于湖北非武汉地区新增出院人数已于5天前开始大于新增病例，可推定该数据变化主要体现武汉收治能力的提高。
As the number of new patients discharged from non-Wuhan in Hubei Province began to be greater than the new cases five days ago, it can be assumed that the change mainly reflects the improvement of treatment capacity in Wuhan.
另一方面也请注意我们推测的“湖北确诊未入院”人数连日来不断下降，18日一举下降1200多例，19日又降1000余例。
On the other hand, please note that the number of people diagnosed as unhospitalized in Hubei dropped by more than 1200 cases on the 18th and more than 1,000 on the 19th.
这也应是武汉推进“五个百分百”的结果，是局面向好的标志。
This should also be Wuhan to promote the "five hundred percent" result, is a good sign of the situation.
七、病死率有回升，但治愈率以快速度增长图11病死率继续回升，这里有病死发生时间与新确诊增加不同步的因素，也有救治能力和医疗资源因素。
The fatality rate is rising, but the recovery rate is growing at a rapid rate. Figure 11 shows that the mortality rate continues to rise. There are factors such as the timing of death and the increase in newly diagnosed cases, as well as treatment capacity and medical resources.
武汉病死率仍明显高于湖北和全国。
Wuhan fatality rate is still significantly higher than Hubei and China.
图12治愈率以更快速度上升，这正是我们所期盼的。
Fig. 12 The cure rate is increasing at a faster rate, which is exactly what we would like.
图13.1新出院人数与新确诊人数图13.2图13.3图13.4有网友提醒昨天全国口径也出现了“黄金交叉”，今天放回此图。
Figure 13.1 Number of New Discharges and Number of New Confirmed Persons Figure 13.2 Figure 13.3 Figure 13.4 Some netizens reminded the nation that the "golden cross" also appeared yesterday.
这标志着从全国角度看，战局也已发生转折（请注意这中间有300例甚至更多的湖北批量核减因素）。
This marks a turning point for the country as well (note that there are 300 or more Hubei bulk nuclear reductions).
可以看到武汉以外地区继续逐日加大释放以医院病床床位为核心的医疗资源。
It can be seen that outside Wuhan continues to increase the daily release of hospital beds as the core of medical resources.
武汉也终于离“黄金交叉”不远了！小结：湖北以外地区全面逼近零新增，疫情已得到全面有效控制。
Wuhan is also not far from the "golden cross"! Summary: Hubei area is approaching zero new, the epidemic has been fully effective control.
眼下应着手加快“返工复产”，不必过度担心“返工潮”风险。
The time has come to speed up "rework" without worrying too much about the risk of a return to work.
武汉五个百分百战役似已完成，若传染源得到彻底隔离，武汉战局将很快发生根本扭转！▲点击图片查看更多疫情报道责编| 蒋丽 lijiang@caijing.com.cn本文为《财经》杂志原创文章，未经授权不得转载或建立镜像。
