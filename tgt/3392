隔离点的工作没有白天黑夜，只有随时响应。
The isolation points work day and night, only ready to respond.
记者 |应　琛“你把这些表格，这样填一下，就可以交给……”3月11日18点多，天山路街道社区卫生服务中心的质控科科长陆伟峰正在长宁区一家集中医学观察隔离点跟新来的同事交接工作。
At 18: 00 on March 11, Lu Weifeng, chief of the Quality Control Section at Tianshan Road Street Community Health Service Center, was handing over to a new colleague at a centralized medical observation post in Changning.
从2月19日起，陆伟峰就带着他的队员进驻这里，开启了一线抗疫的日子。
From February 19, Lu Weifeng brought his team here to start the first day of fighting the epidemic.
医务人员是他们，服务人员也是他们。
The paramedics are them, and the service people are them.
而当天，是陆伟峰正式撤出隔离点的日子，接下来他要进行14天的居家隔离。
That was the day Mr. Lu formally withdrew from the quarantine, followed by a 14-day quarantine.
在3月4日下午举行的上海市新冠肺炎疫情防控工作领导小组新闻发布会上明确了，所有中外人员，凡是在进入上海之日前14天内，有过韩国、意大利、伊朗、日本等国家旅行或居住史的，一律实施居家或集中隔离健康观察，即一律隔离14天。
At the press conference of the Shanghai Leading Group on Prevention and Control of the New Crown Pneumonia held on the afternoon of March 4, it was made clear that all Chinese and foreign personnel who had traveled or lived in Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan and other countries within 14 days before the date of entry into Shanghai should be kept in isolation for 14 days.
根据最新消息，上海市新冠肺炎防控工作领导小组办公室宣布，为进一步防控境外输入疫情风险，从3月13日零时起，所有中外人员，凡是在进入上海之日前14天内，有过韩国、意大利、伊朗、日本、法国、西班牙、德国、美国等国家旅行或居住史的，一律实施居家或集中隔离健康观察，也就是一律隔离14天。
According to the latest information, the Shanghai Municipal Leading Group for the Prevention and Control of New Crown Pneumonia announced that from 0000 hours on March 13, all Chinese and foreign personnel with a history of travel or residence in Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan, France, Spain, Germany and the United States will be placed under quarantine for 14 days.
是的，为了严防新冠肺炎疫情从境外输入，从航班落地到隔离，上海真的拼了！在这个集中隔离点里，每天接收人员数量不断被刷新。
Yes, in order to prevent the outbreak of pneumonia from abroad, from landing to isolation, Shanghai really spell! In this centralized quarantine point, the number of people received daily is constantly updated.
随着疫情形势的突变，隔离点工作的难度和复杂性前所未有。
With the sudden change of epidemic situation, it is more difficult and complex to work in the isolation point.
作为队长，陆伟峰承担着更大的压力和重任，电话铃声从早到晚几乎没有一刻停下来。
As the captain, Lu Weifeng bear more pressure and heavy responsibility, telephone ring from morning till night almost no stop.
40多个小时未合眼某天16时左右，陆伟峰接到机场打来的电话，说会送20多个旅客到隔离点。
More than 40 hours did not close his eyes one day around 16 o'clock, Lu Weifeng received a phone call from the airport, said will send more than 20 passengers to the quarantine point.
挂了电话，陆伟峰和队员们做了些准备，就来到大门口等候。
Hanging up the phone, Lu Weifeng and the team made some preparations, and came to the gate to wait.
按照以往惯例，一般只要等个半小时，但那天车子却迟迟未到。
The usual practice was to wait only half an hour, but the car did not arrive that day.
陆伟峰和队员们就按照原计划，开始配送晚餐和分发快递。
Lu and his team proceeded to deliver dinner and express delivery as planned.
“我们这一般收三类人，确诊或疑似病例的密切接触者，这个一般由街道送来；疫情重点地区到达的人和转机时间超过12小时的过境人员，这都是由机场送来。
"We usually have three groups of people, people in close contact with confirmed or suspected cases, which are usually sent from the street, people arriving in priority areas of the outbreak and people crossing the border for more than 12 hours during transit, all from airports.
”陆伟峰告诉《新民周刊》，“之前，我们这里平均每天大概会送来十几个人。
"Before that, we sent about a dozen people a day on average," Lu told Xinmin Weekly.
调整疫情重点地区之后，我们也调整了人员、物资分配，做了一些应对大客流的准备，但因为我们只对接虹桥国际机场T1的旅客，所以我们预计一次送来峰值大概会在二三十人左右。
After adjusting the key areas of the outbreak, we adjusted the distribution of personnel and supplies and made some preparations to deal with the large passenger flow, but since we only docked passengers at Hong Qiao International Airport T1, we expected a peak of about twenty or thirty people at a time.
”但当天20时左右，机场的车子终于到达隔离点，一下子来了40多名旅客，数量翻了一倍。
"But at about 2000, the airport's car finally reached the quarantine point and more than 40 passengers arrived, doubling the number.
但负责对接的人还是只有陆伟峰他们五个人。
But the only person in charge of docking was Lu Weifeng, five of them.
信息登记、拍照确认、分配房间、回答咨询、送至房间指导注意事项……这些看似简单的流程背后，常常会出现各种情况“卡壳”——填写表格时各种各样的问题抛过来：“医生，我没有带身份证。
Registration of information, photo identification, room assignment, answering inquiries, giving directions to your room... Behind these seemingly simple processes, there are often a variety of things that can get "stuck" when filling out forms: "Doctor, I don't have my ID card.
”“我去无锡入职的，不知道地址怎么办？”“扫码登记？我不会用手机。
"I went to Wuxi to get on the job, I don't know the address?" "Sweep the code? I can't use the mobile phone.
”“我刚从韩国来没有国内电话卡。
"I've just come from South Korea without a domestic phone card.
”“手机没电了，信息我记不住。
"" The phone is dead, I can't remember the message.
”……“这些都是最终会转化为报表的基础信息，非常重要。
... "These are the basic information that will eventually be translated into reports, and that's very important.
”陆伟峰表示，队员们要不停地解决各种问题才能完成第一步，“而且，当天来的旅客其实13点左右就已经下飞机了，在机场进行了严格的筛查后，到我这里其实是7个小时后了。
Mr Lu said the players had to work through problems to get the first move done. "Moreover, the passengers who arrived that day had actually disembarked around 1300 and arrived seven hours after the airport had been strictly screened.
他们一路都没有吃饭，很多明明是12小时内转机的旅客，也变成了需要送到隔离点的情况，有情绪是在所难免的。
They did not eat all the way, many are clearly within 12 hours of the transfer of passengers, but also into the need to be sent to the quarantine point, emotional is inevitable.
”穿着防护服，隔着N95和外科口罩，本来已经呼吸不畅，队员们还要不停地大声说话，安抚旅客的情绪。
Wearing protective clothing and wearing the N95 and surgical masks, the team was already breathing poorly and talking loudly to soothe the passengers.
所有信息登记完之后，队员们还要带领他们从室外的户外楼梯步行到达三楼缓冲区，再进入各楼层，遇到团队需要分批带上去。
After checking out all the information, the team had to walk from the outdoor staircase to the third floor buffer zone, then into each floor.
几个来回下来，往往气喘吁吁。
A few back and forth, often panting.
这还不算完，给每个房间送洗漱用品，把旅客点的外卖送到房间……安顿完所有旅客后，已接近0点。
This is not enough, to send toiletries to each room, passengers order take-out to the room... After settling all the passengers, it is close to 0.
“我还要汇总、处理各种信息，完成当日的报表。
"I also need to aggregate and process all kinds of information to complete the day's statements.
因为隔离点内有大量的中转人员，他们每个人出发的时间都不一样，因此还要联系车辆、协调对接，以及安排陪送人员，确保按时将旅客送到各个交通枢纽。
As there are a large number of transit personnel in the quarantine point, each of them leaves at different times, there is also a need to contact vehicles, coordinate docking and arrange escorts to ensure that passengers are transported to the various transport hubs on time.
”陆伟峰说，大客流进出的工作其实是最复杂的。
Mr Lu said the flow of passengers was in fact the most complex.
这天所有工作完成，陆伟峰躺下休息时已是第二天凌晨三点，“这段时间能睡三四个小时就已经很不错了”。
It was three o'clock in the morning when Lu Weifeng lay down to rest. "It was a good time to sleep three or four hours."
正在处理工作的陆伟峰但第二天60人，第三天80人……送来的旅客每日递增。
Is handling the work of Lu Weifeng but the next day 60 people, the third day 80 people...
眼看着隔离点已经收了184人，快接近188人的最大接收量，长宁区又立即增开了一处新的集中隔离点，同时也给陆伟峰增派了两名新的队员。
Seeing the site already receiving 184 people, close to its maximum capacity of 188, Changning immediately opened a new central quarantine point, but also sent two new members to Lu Weifeng.
“原定他们只是白天来帮忙，并不在隔离点住的，但来了之后，工作实在太多，就直接住了下来。
"They were supposed to come to help during the day, not to stay in the quarantine, but when they arrived, there was so much work to do that.
”陆伟峰告诉记者，即便如此，80人那天，他们一直忙到第二天凌晨3点，“一个小时后当天的工作又开始了。
Even so, Mr. Lu told reporters, 80 people were busy until 3 a. m. the next day, "and work began again an hour later.
因为第一批需要送去机场转机的旅客即将出发了，我们要去叫起，再填一些表格，完成相关转运手续，这两天加起来等于是40多个小时没合眼”。
As the first group of passengers needed to take their connecting flight to the airport was about to depart, we had to get up, fill out some more forms and go through the relevant transshipment formalities.
人称“黑哥”的陆伟峰，在同事眼中绝对是“吃苦耐劳”型。
Known as "Black Brother" Lu Weifeng, in the eyes of colleagues is absolutely "hard-working" type.
就连他都坦言：“2007年开始工作到现在，从来没有连续工作过这么长时间。
Even he admitted: "I've never worked so long since I started working in 2007.
”但隔离点的工作没有白天黑夜，只有随时响应。
But the work of the quarantine point is not day or night, only ready to respond.
管好近200人的隔离工作到底有多难？集中隔离点的某个房间是工作人员的“总调度室”，这里是信息枢纽中心和工作指挥中心，陆伟峰的两个手机加上一个固定电话，通常这个还没接好另外一个就响起。
One of the rooms in the central quarantine is the staff's "master dispatching room," an information hub and work command center, and Lu's two cell phones plus a landline phone, which usually rings before the other one is connected.
所有的上级各部门指令、所有的街道转运事项、所有航站楼接收信息，都需要以最快的时间派单给工作人员。
All superior department instructions, all street trans-shipment matters, and all terminal buildings receive information that needs to be sent to staff as quickly as possible.
正常情况下，每天7点起床后，所有队员都是边吃早餐，边开会布置当天的任务，然后就各自开展工作。
Normally, after 7: 00 each day, all the team members eat breakfast, meet to set up the tasks of the day, and then work on their own.
近乎满员的集中隔离点，各种要求和问题应接不暇。
The near-full concentration of isolation points is overwhelmed by demands and problems.
“房间灯不亮”“房间上不了网”“我点了外卖麻烦送一下”“我孩子要上网课麻烦打印一下资料”……于是隔离点里的队员，除了一日两次的医学观察外，还承担了送饭、送快递、送外卖，甚至修马桶的各种活。
"The room is not on" "I ordered take-out, please send it off" "My child is going to have trouble printing out material for the internet class..." So the team members at the quarantine site, in addition to their twice-daily medical observation, carried out various tasks such as delivering food, delivering couriers, delivering takeout and even mending toilet bowls.
“最多的时候，我们一天要送100多个快递。
"Most of the time, we deliver over 100 couriers a day.
”陆伟峰回忆道。
Mr Lu recalls.
因为这里还入住了俄罗斯、意大利、韩国、日本等外籍人士。
Because here also live in Russia, Italy, Korea, Japan and other foreigners.
遇到他们发生问题时，翻译器、翻译软件、身体比划，工作有时更加困难。
When they encounter problems, translators, translation software, physical strokes, work is sometimes more difficult.
天山社区护士高玉婷和隔离点里的外籍人士这段时间，往往前一波旅客还未处置好，新的一波就来了。
Tianshan District Nurse Kao Yu Ting and the isolation of foreigners in this time, often the previous wave of passengers have not been disposed of, a new wave came.
人多的时候行李和人员被迫分开，消毒好后还多了一项送行李的工作。
Many people when the luggage and personnel were forced to separate, disinfection after the completion of an additional luggage delivery.
“有一次我接一个妈妈和孩子，带了9个大箱子，不帮着拿怎么办？” 队员谢智晋是天山路街道社区卫生服务中心的一名家庭医生。
"Once I followed a mother and a child, with nine big boxes, do not help to take what?" Xie Zhijin, a family doctor at Tianshan Road Street Community Health Center.
这些平时对健身的他来说是“小case”的活儿，在防护服的作用下，也常常让他上气不接下气。
These usually to the fitness of him is "small case" work, in the role of protective clothing, often let him out of breath.
有时忙完一天，盒饭早已经凉掉。
Sometimes, after a busy day, the boxed rice is already cold.
“不想说话不想吃饭，感觉身体被掏空……今天时间还不算长的。
"I don't want to talk, I don't want to eat, I feel like I'm being hollowed out.
”谢智晋休息了半晌后默默地吃一点，毕竟夜还很长……此外，每日信息汇报也是极其重要的工作。
"Xie Zhijin after a long rest quietly eat a bit, after all, the night is still long... In addition, daily information reporting is also extremely important work.
每日把各种手工报表转换成电子报表，从基础信息表制作各类报表，每日进进出出几十人，能做到数字一致绝非易事，熬夜做完后有任何偏差都会成为压倒意志力的最后一根稻草。
It is not easy to convert manual statements into electronic ones every day, to produce various forms from the basic information sheet, to enter and out dozens of people every day, to achieve the same number is not easy, to stay up after any deviation will become the last straw to overwhelm willpower.
所以每次凌晨，陆伟峰在最后一刻确认无误后会像进球一样欢呼，这是可以睡觉的标志，如果天还黑着。
So every morning, Lu Wei-feng after the last-minute confirmation will be like a goal cheering, this can be a sign of sleep, if it is still dark.
作为团队的“灵魂人物”，陆伟峰在集中隔离点其实是“梅开二度”，早在大年初五左右，他就已经在隔离点工作过一段时间。
As the "soul" of the team, Lu Wei-feng in the central isolation point is actually "two degrees", as early as about five years ago, he has been working in isolation for some time.
疫情防控形势变化莫测，各种措施流程随时更新，现在的他已经练就了边解读、边实施、边复盘、边优化的“战时指挥力”。
The situation of epidemic prevention and control is unpredictable, and the flow of measures is constantly updated. Now he has mastered the "wartime command" of interpretation, side-by-side implementation, side-by-side optimization.
队员谢智晋，跟随队长进入集中隔离点后就开始了凌乱的作息，承担起更多的“体力活”。
Team member Xie Zhijin, following the captain into the concentrated isolation point began to messy work, assume more "manual labor."
队员高玉婷，每日清点物资，及时联络补给，是全队的后勤保障员。
Team member Gao Yuting, daily inventory, timely contact supplies, is the team's logistics support staff.
队员许如意，增援进入隔离点，快速接手“总调度”和报表相关工作，成为队长的得力助手。
Team members into the quarantined, reinforcements to quickly take over the "total dispatch" and report-related work, become the captain's right-hand assistant.
队员袁佳佳，从门诊直接来到隔离点增援，她的到来，拯救了两位男队员的“体力坍塌”。
Team member Yuan Jiajia, from the clinic directly to the isolation point reinforcements, her arrival, saved the two men's "physical collapse."
除了天山路街道社区卫生服务中心，团队里还有两位周桥社区的护士，她们承担了一天两次的医学观察工作和在集中接收人员的时候各个楼层的保障服务。
In addition to the Tianshan Road Street Community Health Service Center, the team included two nurses from the Zhouqiao community who performed medical observation twice a day and guaranteed services on all floors when the personnel were collected centrally.
天山社区队员入驻隔离点唯一的“全家福””陆伟峰说，在这个特殊的时期，大家齐心协力，并肩作战，相互打气，彼此温暖。
"The only family picture" of the Tianshan community at the quarantined site said Lu Weifeng said that at this special time, people were working together, fighting side by side, cheering each other up and warming up.
深夜里，天山社区队员拍了入驻以来唯一的一张“全家福”，每个人都举着大大的“V”，那是他们最深切的期盼。
At night, the Tianshan community members took the only picture of their family since their arrival, each holding a large "V," which was their deepest expectation.
