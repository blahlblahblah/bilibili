/ [^ # 39 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105] / n. The Indian and other non-Eurasians killed by pathogens in Eurasia kill far more than by guns or steel weapons in Eurasia.
——《枪炮、病菌与钢铁》[1]01.1918年3月，25艘满载士兵的军舰从美国出发，驶向大西洋另一端的欧洲。
Rifles, Germs, and Steel & amp; Steel & # 39; & # 39; & # 39; & # 39; & # 39; & # 39; & # 39; & # 39; & # 39; & # 39; & # 39; & # 39; & # 39; & # 39; & # 39; In March 1918, 25 warships laden with soldiers sailed from the United States to Europe across the Atlantic.
此时的欧洲大陆，已在第一次世界大战的泥潭里深陷近4年。
At this time, the European continent, in the quagmire of the First World War, almost four years deep.
远渡而来的美国援军，对于英法等协约国而言，显然如雪中送炭。
The American reinforcements who arrived far away were a clear boon to Britain, France and other allies.
无人知晓，这批援军身上，携带着比战争更危险的杀器——流感病毒。
No one knows that the reinforcements were carrying the flu virus, a more dangerous weapon than the war.
这种刚刚传播到人类身上的病毒，最初来自美国堪萨斯州一个偏远农场的家畜或家禽。
The virus, which has just spread to humans, originally came from livestock or poultry on a remote farm in Kansas.
被感染的农场工人应征入伍，将它带到了美国第二大新兵训练营。
The infected farm worker was recruited and taken to the second largest boot camp in the United States.
当时，这种病的症状并不严重，新兵们照常被送往欧洲战场。
At that time, the symptoms of the disease were not serious, and recruits were routinely sent to the European battlefields.
他们的登陆地点是法国布雷斯特港，效果也立竿见影：美军到来第二天，法国海军司令部因流感中断指挥。
They landed at the French port of Brest, and the effect was immediate: the day after the arrival of American troops, the French naval command was interrupted by the flu.
在前线拥挤的战壕中，不知名的病毒大肆扩散。
Unknown viruses proliferate in the front lines of crowded trenches.
和炮弹不同，病毒的攻击不分国界。
Unlike artillery shells, virus attacks know no borders.
一度在战场上取得优势的德军，因为流感造成的减员，不得不数次推迟总攻；从6月到8月，200万在法国的英军士兵中，有120万人被传染。
The German army, which had once gained an advantage on the battlefield, had to postpone its general offensive several times because of the loss of staff caused by the flu; from June to August, 1.2 million of the 2 million British soldiers in France were infected.
但直到此时，绝大多数人的病症依然轻微，士兵们把它叫做“三日热”，《柳叶刀》上的论文称，这种发热疾病可能连流感都算不上。
But until now, the disease was still mild in most people, and the soldiers called it a "three-day heat," which, according to the Lancet paper, might not even be the flu.
有一段时期，病毒甚至短暂地消失了。
For a while, the virus even disappeared briefly.
人们放松了警惕，病毒却在迅速变异、传播。
People relax their vigilance, but the virus is rapidly mutating and spreading.
那是属于海运的时代。
It was the age of shipping.
没有民航飞机，水运是远距离大批量运输的最优解决方案。
Without civil aircraft, water transport is the best solution for long-range mass transportation.
船舶将旅客和货物带到世界各地，同时带来的，还有病毒。
Ships carry passengers and cargo around the world, along with viruses.
长距离的航行、相对封闭的空间和较差的卫生条件，让病毒有充分机会传播并爆发。
Long distances, relatively closed spaces and poor sanitary conditions give the virus ample opportunity to spread and explode.
许多船只在航行途中，就已经成了名副其实的“瘟疫船”。
Many a ship has become a veritable pestilence ship on the voyage.
6月，货船“埃克塞特城市”号从英国驶往美国。
In June, the freighter Exeter City sailed from England to the United States.
到达费城码头时，大量奄奄一息的船员被直接送到医院，而后接二连三地死亡。
When they arrived at Philadelphia Pier, a large number of dying crew members were taken directly to the hospital, where they died one after another.
8月，英国皇家海军军舰“曼图亚”号抵达塞拉利昂补充燃料，200名患流感的船员将疫病传给了当地人。
In August, the Royal Navy ship Mantua arrived in Sierra Leone to refuel and 200 flu-infected crew members passed the disease on to locals.
同月，另一艘海军运输舰“切普斯托城堡”号同样在这里停留，三周后，船上1150人中，死亡率达到了骇人的38%[2]。
The same month, another naval transport ship, the Chepsteau Castle, was there, too. Three weeks later, the death rate among the 1,150 on board reached a staggering 38 per cent and # 91; 2 & # 93;
商船和运输船还迅速将病毒带向了远东。
Merchant ships and transporters also quickly brought the virus to the Far East.
印度、中国都出现了大量感染病例。
India and China have had a large number of infections.
后来，印度成为全世界疫情最惨烈的地区之一。
Later, India became one of the worst affected regions in the world.
9月，病毒正式卷土重来。
In September, the virus made a comeback.
这一次，它变异成了致命的瘟疫。
This time, it mutated into a deadly plague.
一艘艘“瘟疫船”，不仅仅是海上移动的传染源，也是活生生的人间地狱。
Each "plague ship" is not only a source of infection moving in the sea, but also a living hell.
9月29日，美国再次派出一批军舰，从新泽西出发奔赴欧洲。
On Sept. 29, the United States sent another warship from New Jersey to Europe.
这批军舰普遍超载50%，挤满了士兵。
The ships were generally 50 percent overloaded with soldiers.
其中一艘名为“大海兽”号的军舰，载着9000名士兵，以及致命的病毒。
One of the ships, the Great Sea Beast, carried 9,000 soldiers and a deadly virus.
“大海兽”号上数百人都没能活着抵达目的地，还有很多士兵在登陆后24小时内死亡。
Hundreds of people aboard the Beast did not make it to their destination alive, and many died within 24 hours of landing.
从船舱到医院途中，他们又感染了更多的人。
On their way from the cabin to the hospital, they became infected with more people.
这场发源于美国、扩散于英法的瘟疫，后来被冠以“西班牙流感”的名号。
The plague, which originated in the United States and spread to Britain and France, was later dubbed the "Spanish flu."
这是因为西班牙不是一战参战国，没有战时新闻管制，所以对流感疫情的报道较为及时充分，结果反而让人误以为它是疫病的发源地[3]。
This is because Spain was not a World War I belligerent and did not have wartime news regulations, so a timely and adequate account of the flu epidemic led to the mistaken belief that it was at the origin of the disease and had not been at its service.
1918年到1919年，“西班牙流感”横扫世界，根据最保守的估计，它造成的全球死亡人数至少为2000万人。
The Spanish flu swept the world from 1918 to 1919, killing at least 20 million people globally according to the most conservative estimates.
而据诺奖得主伯内特估计，死亡人数可达5000万至1亿人[4]。
And Nobel laureate Burnett estimates that the death toll could have ranged from 50 million to 100 million; 4 & # 93; # 93;
相比之下，持续了4年多的第一次世界大战阵亡人数是1000万人左右。
By contrast, the number of World War I casualties, which lasted more than four years, was about 10 million.
病毒比枪炮更加致命。
Viruses are more deadly than guns.
02.在“西班牙流感”爆发前，人类对“瘟疫船”并非毫无警惕和防范。
2. Before the outbreak of the Spanish flu, humans were not unwary and defenseless against the plague.
数百年前，另一场惨烈的瘟疫——黑死病席卷欧洲后，心有余悸的人们初次意识到了远渡而来的船只可能携带的危险。
Hundreds of years ago, after another devastating plague, the Black Death, struck Europe, frightened people for the first time of the dangers that ferried ships could carry.
一个冷知识：英语中的“隔离检疫”（Quarantine），语源来自意大利语Quarantina Giorni，本意是“四十天”。
One cold lesson: Quarantine in English comes from the Italian Quarantina Giorni, meaning "forty days."
1377年，当时最繁荣的海港城市之一拉古萨（现为克罗地亚杜布罗夫尼克），为了防止船上的人将疫病传到当地，出台规定：前来靠岸的船只，必须在海上停留30天，身体无恙者才能上岸。
In 1377, one of the most prosperous seaport cities of the time, Lagusa (now Dubrovnik, Croatia), in order to prevent the spread of the disease to the people on board, introduced the requirement that ships arriving at the shore must stay at sea for 30 days before disembarkation.
这种做法随后被各大海港城市沿袭。
This practice was subsequently followed by major seaport cities.
1448年，威尼斯议院进一步决定，将这个隔离期延长到40天。
In 1448, the Venice Parliament further decided to extend the period of isolation to 40 days.
“40天”于是成为了“隔离期”的代名词[5]。
"Forty days" has thus become synonymous with & # 91; & # 91; & # 93; & # 93; & # 45; & # 93; & # 45; & # 93; & # 45; & # 91;
当时的实践和后世研究证明，对船只施行40天隔离期是行之有效的手段。
The practice at that time and subsequent studies proved that the 40-day isolation period for ships was an effective means.
因为黑死病从感染到死亡的周期据推测是38天，而通过对从1347年到1760年超过6000场瘟疫的数据分析，重要的航运路线与瘟疫传播的路线几乎总是重合[6]。
Because the Black Death's cycle from infection to death is presumed to be 38 days, and by analysing data on more than 6,000 cases from 1347 to 1760, important shipping routes and plague transmission routes almost always overlap with & # 91; 6 & # 93; & # 93;
但隔离只能防范天灾，无法抵抗人祸。
But isolation can only protect against natural disasters, not man-made disasters.
1720年，一艘名为“伟大的圣安东尼”号的商船抵达法国马赛，按照规定在港口隔离。
In 1720, a merchant ship, the Great Saint-Antoine, arrived in Marseilles, France, to be quarantined in accordance with regulations.
不巧这艘船的船主正是马赛副市长，他利用职权之便，要求“通融”，提前卸货。
It happened that the owner of the vessel, the deputy mayor of Marseilles, had taken advantage of his position to demand an early discharge of cargo.
船舱中的虱子随着货物落地，它们携带着腺鼠疫病菌，迅速遍布整个城市。
Lice from the cabin landed with the cargo, carrying bubonic plague germs that quickly spread throughout the city.
官员的一次渎职徇私，最终酿成了持续了长达两年的瘟疫，约10万人死亡[7]。
A malfeasance and favouritism on the part of officials culminated in a plague that lasted two years, with about 100,000 people killed and # 91; 7 & # 93; & # 93;
油画中的马赛瘟疫对于已然感染瘟疫的船只而言，隔离虽然可以避免将瘟疫传播到陆地，却无法阻止它在船上肆虐。
The Masai Plague in Painting For ships already infected with the plague, quarantining prevents the plague from spreading to land, but it does not stop it from wreaking havoc on ships.
1852年8月，一艘名为“提康德罗加”号的客船从利物浦出发，前往墨尔本。
In August 1852, a passenger ship named "Tecondroga" left Liverpool for Melbourne.
船舱中，大多是因为饥荒和贫困前往新大陆谋生的苏格兰人和英格兰人。
Most of the cabins were filled with Scots and English who went to the New World to earn their living because of famine and poverty.
出发不到一周，疾病开始爆发。
Less than a week after departure, the disease began to break out.
超载、糟糕的通风条件和越来越恶劣的卫生条件加剧了瘟疫蔓延。
Overloading, poor ventilation and increasingly poor sanitary conditions have contributed to the spread of the epidemic.
船上的药品很快用尽，越来越多的人死去。
The medicine on the ship ran out quickly, and more and more people died.
地狱般的航程持续了90天。
The hellish voyage lasted 90 days.
抵达墨尔本后，他们停留在隔离区，开始得到物资和医疗人员的补充，但仍有82人在六周内陆续死亡。
Upon arrival in Melbourne, they remained in the area of separation and began to be replenished by material and medical personnel, although 82 people continued to die within six weeks.
最后，814名乘客中，168人死于这场瘟疫[8]。
Finally, 168 of the 814 passengers who died at & # 91; & # 91; 8 & # 93; & # 93;
人们也在不断从“瘟疫船”的悲惨历史中吸取教训。
People are also learning from the tragic history of "plague ships."
黑死病让人类认识到了隔离和检疫的重要性，从此将其固定为一种制度；1850年开始的第三次鼠疫大流行，让人们开始学会用硫磺熏舱灭鼠[9]；而“西班牙流感”后，欧美国家纷纷开始建立国家级的公共卫生系统。
The Black Death made humans aware of the importance of quarantine and quarantine and has since been institutionalized; the third plague pandemic, which began in 1850, began to teach people to use sulfur-fumigated rats and mice; 9; 93; and in the wake of the Spanish flu, countries in Europe and the United States have begun to build national public health systems.
但直到今天，如何对待“瘟疫船”，依然是一个难以解决的伦理困境。
But to this day, how to deal with the plague ship is still a difficult ethical dilemma.
船上乘客的生命安全与陆地上更多人的生命安全之间，在现有的科技条件下，终归难以两全。
The safety of passengers on the ship and the lives of more people on land are difficult to reconcile under the current scientific and technological conditions.
03.在民用航空日益普及后，航运不再是最主流的长途客运手段。
With the increasing prevalence of civil aviation, shipping is no longer the dominant means of long-distance passenger transport.
如今的大型载客船只，其目的不再是运输，而是休闲、旅游。
Today's big passenger ships, the purpose is no longer transport, but leisure, tourism.
今天的远航邮轮上，卫生和居住条件已经有了长足进步，但它毕竟仍是一个准封闭、甚至十分拥挤的人类聚集空间，船上聚集着来自各地的乘客，每个人都有可能是潜在的病原。
Health and living conditions on today's ocean liner have improved considerably, but it is still a quasi-enclosed, if not crowded, human gathering place, with passengers from all over the world, each of whom could be a potential pathogen.
这并非危言耸听。
This is not alarmist.
仅仅从去年算起，数条豪华邮轮线路都曾发生过病毒传播事件。
Since last year alone, several luxury cruise lines have been infected with the virus.
2019年1月，世界上最大的邮轮之一“海洋绿洲”号从佛罗里达出发前往牙买加，但仅仅一天之后就掉头返航，因为船上277人感染了诺如病毒。
In January 2019, one of the world's largest cruise ships, Oasis of the Sea, set out from Florida for Jamaica, but only a day later turned back because 277 people on board were infected with the virus.
5月，美国“山达基教”的一艘豪华邮轮发生麻疹疫情，318人被隔离在海上。
In May, 318 people were quarantined at sea after a measles outbreak on a luxury cruise ship belonging to the US "Scientology."
今年，当全世界都在关注“钻石公主”号上的新冠肺炎疫情时，其他邮轮也在遭遇瘟疫潮。
This year, as the world focused on the new Crown Pneumonia outbreak aboard the Princess Diamond, other cruise ships were hit by the plague.
2月5日开始，“威士特丹”号因疑似载有新冠肺炎患者，被迫在海上漂泊了近两周；2月10日，“加勒比公主”号因至少299名乘客和22名船员感染诺如病毒而返回佛罗里达；11日，英国“发现精神”号也因诺如病毒爆发而在直布罗陀遭遇遣返。
The Rotterdam-based Princess of the Caribbean was forced to drift about the sea for nearly two weeks starting February 5 because she was suspected of having SARS. On February 10, the Princess of the Caribbean returned to Florida to infect at least 299 passengers and 22 crew members.
一切都在提醒我们，“瘟疫船”的阴影从未彻底消失。
Everything reminds us that the shadow of the plague ship has never completely disappeared.
它就像任何一种致命的病原体一样，一旦遇到合适的温床，就会卷土重来，重新成为人类的噩梦。
Like any deadly pathogen, it will return to being a nightmare for humanity once it meets the right hotbed.
