城里的人出不去，城外的人进不来，留汉的宠物面临被饿死的境况。
The people of the city could not get out, the people of the city could not get in, and the pets of the Lehans faced starvation.
文 | 许建宝、赵琼、周晓雨、王超编辑 | 沈小山武汉封城之后，除了留守的人们，还有数不清的无人照管的宠物。
When Xu Jianbao, Zhao Qiong, Zhou Xiaoyu, Wang Chao's editor and Shen Shan Wuhan, there have been countless abandoned pets besides those left behind.
有些饲主早已料到不能及时回来便放生了，让宠物自寻生路；更多的饲主舍不得又带不走，不得不把宠物留在武汉，大门紧锁。
Some breeders have long predicted that they will not be able to return in time to let their pets find their own way; more owners are reluctant to take them away and have to keep their pets locked in Wuhan.
不得已的分离“我的十柒是我的宝贝女儿。
"My decadence is my darling daughter.
她是2018年11月17日，也是我生日的前一天来的武汉，所以我叫她十柒。
She was in Wuhan on November 17, 2018, the day before my birthday, so I call her Qiyi.
有了十柒以后，每天下班就想直接回家照顾她，陪她玩，会担心她的身体状况。
With ten Qi, every day after work would like to go home to take care of her, play with her, will worry about her physical condition.
一个人的时候还会跟她说一说发生的事情，会跟她讲自己的心事。
A person will also tell her what happened, will tell her their own mind.
对于我来说，她不止是一条生命，还是我的家人，我们是彼此的陪伴。
To me, she is not only a life, but also my family, we are each other's company.
”在武汉工作的魏雪（化名）说。
"said Wei Xue, who works in Wuhan.
她每次有事或者出差都会把十柒寄放在一家宠物店，宠物店老板人好，每天都会和她视频通话，好让她放心。
She keeps her pet shop in the same spot every time she is in business or on a business trip. The pet shop owner is very kind and talks to her on video every day to reassure her.
这次武汉疫情爆发，这家宠物店帮了大忙。
The pet store helped greatly with the outbreak of the Wuhan epidemic.
然而，众多离汉的人可没有这样的幸运。
However, many people who have left the Han Dynasty are not so lucky.
更多人是还没来得及妥善安置自己的宠物就不得不赶在封城之前匆匆离开。
More people had to leave before they could make proper arrangements for their pets.
1月26日晚7点32分，舒克在朋友圈发布一则求助信息“有没有住在洪山区**小区附近的朋友，过几天能去看看猫么，加下水喝粮，好怕它饿死，求求。
On January 26, at 7: 32 p.m., Shuk posted a help message in his circle of friends: "Do you have friends living near the Hongshan area? Can you see the cat in a few days? Add water and drink food, so that it will starve to death, please.
”联系舒克的时候，她告诉我们：“猫已经在家6天了，猫粮和水估计还能坚持五六天，这么久没有看它，心里还是有点担心，重点是钥匙还在自己手上，如果要找上门帮喂还得先把钥匙寄过来。
"The cat has been at home for six days and the cat food and water are expected to last five or six days," she told us.
1月26日，舒克朋友圈像舒克这样的情况，武汉有不少。
On January 26, the Shuk circle of friends like Shu Ke such a situation, Wuhan has a lot.
有的饲主找熟人、朋友上门喂养，解决问题。
Some breeders look for acquaintances, friends to feed home, solve problems.
最难的还是人不在武汉，在武汉也没有熟人。
The most difficult or not in Wuhan, there are no acquaintances.
关于宠物的自救土猫群群主——伊万1月24日，武汉形势严峻，武汉土猫群群主伊万和群里的管理员商讨了这一次危机的解决办法，伊万决定组织人员喂养留汉宠物。
2007-3-1 15: 55: 00 Wuhan is in a serious situation. Ivan, the owner of the Wuhan native cat colony, and the group manager discussed the solution to the crisis. Ivan decided to organize a feeding program for the animals.
随后，伊万和管理员们先在微博上进行提醒，随后收到了不少网友的回复，于是开始着手建群相关事宜。
Subsequently, Ivan and the administrators in the micro-blog to remind, and then received a lot of netizens to reply, so began to set up group-related matters.
1月24日，武汉“土猫同好”微博上门救助需要承担相应的费用，救助者和求助者双方协商价格，为了防止溢价，“土猫”规定了费用上限——一次上门费用150，两只以内是150块钱一次，如果猫比较多，一只猫多50块钱。
On January 24, Wuhan "soil cats with good" micro-blog needs to bear the corresponding expenses, rescuers and requesters negotiate prices, to prevent premium, "Tucat" imposed a fee - 150 a door-to-door fee, 150 yuan within two, and 50 yuan more for a cat if there are more cats.
不能自己抬价。
I can't raise the price myself.
考虑到宠物的安全情况，“土猫”对于上门喂养人的要求很严格，一定要先进行身份审核，附上身份证和自己的近照，审核通过，才可以进行下一步的救助的工作。
Taking into account the safety of pets, the "earth cat" for the door-to-door feeding requirements are very strict, must first carry out identity checks, attached identity cards and their own recent photos, review and approval before proceeding to the next rescue work.
“毕竟是上门，大家都是不认识的人，我们要考虑到猫猫的安全情况。
"After all, it's the door, everyone's not familiar, and we have to think about cat and cat safety.
就是说，你是不是比较懂猫，如果只是一片热心，但是完全没有经验，有的时候反而会帮了倒忙。
If you are just a big fan of cats, but have no experience at all, sometimes you can be very helpful.
还有顾虑是毕竟要进别人家门，我们要考虑到对那些求助的人的财物安全负责，毕竟是通过我们这边来联系到的，所以我们肯定是有责任的。
There is also the concern to enter the door after all, we have to consider those who seek assistance for the security of the property, after all, through our side of the link, so we are certainly responsible.
”伊万说。
'said Ivan.
伊万和志愿者上门救助留汉宠物截至1月27日，求助土猫群的登记人数646，上门帮助人数96，已完成对接互助的人数约为两三百人。
As at January 27, 646 people had registered for assistance from local cat groups, 96 had come to their homes and about two or three hundred people had reached mutual assistance.
帮喂群群主——故梦1月25号下午1：30，故梦创建了第一个帮喂群，群内的武汉本地人帮不在武汉的宠物饲主喂养动物。
So at 1: 30 p.m. on January 25, the dream created the first gang feeding group, Wuhan local people help not in Wuhan pet owners to feed animals.
下午3：30加群的人远超故梦的预期，于是她向武汉小动物协会求助。
At 3: 30 p. m., the crowd jumped on expectations, so she turned to the Wuhan Small Animals Association for help.
很爽快，故梦和武汉小动物协会会长杜帆达成一致——一起做一件帮助“毛孩子”的事情。
Very refreshing, the dream and Wuhan small animals association president Du Fan agreed - together to do a thing to help "hair children."
1月26号，这个帮喂群已经小有影响。
On January 26th, the gang already had a small impact.
武汉光谷帮喂群、武昌帮喂群、藏龙岛帮喂群、汉口帮喂群、汉阳帮喂群等数十个群组建立起来，上千人加入了这场互助活动。
Wuhan Guang Gu group, Wuchang help feed group, Tibetan Dragon Island help group, Hankou group feeding group, Hanyang group feeding dozens of groups, thousands of people joined the mutual assistance activities.
1月27日，武汉光谷帮喂群“这个群能得以建立，主要感谢特别善良的好心人，去帮忙真的就是单纯的善良。
On January 27, Wuhan Guang Gu gang feeding group "This group can be established, mainly thanks to a particularly kind-hearted people, to help is really simple good.
”故梦说，他们有人有车，有人没车，有人仅仅骑着自行车跑遍武汉，就穿梭在武汉的“天南海北”，有人完全免费帮别人喂养宠物，收费的顶多也就是三五十块。
Thus, in the dream, some people have cars, others do not have cars, and some people just ride bicycles through Wuhan, shuttling through Wuhan, where some people feed their pets for nothing, for a maximum of thirty or fifty yuan.
有一些需要开锁的房子，志愿者会全程开着视频和宠物饲主连线，志愿者请来开锁公司的师傅在户主的监督之下开门。
There were houses that needed to be unlocked, volunteers who kept a video link with their owners and volunteers who were invited to open the doors under the supervision of the head of the household.
封城越久，越来越多的留汉宠物将等着开门投喂。
The longer the cityscape lasts, more and more Chinese pets will be waiting for the door to open and feed.
“这些天我收到了人生中最密集的好意。
"I have received the densest kindness of my life these days.
”故梦说。
"said the dream.
封城以后，多了很多干净、很漂亮的流浪动物，一看就知道是最近被弃养的。
After the closure of the city, there are many clean, very beautiful stray animals, it is known to be recently abandoned.
帮喂群里常常会看到这种流浪动物的视频。
Video clips of the stray animals are often seen in the help group.
故梦说，“其实可以把这些动物送到宠物医院或者找别人领养，不要把宠物丢掉。
"You can actually take these animals to a pet hospital or find someone else to adopt them and not throw them away," the dream said
”武汉小动物保护协会会长——杜帆1月26号，武汉小动物协会推送了“疫情管控期间居民家中滞留伴侣动物援助公告”。
Wuhan Small Animals Protection Association (Wuhan Zoological Society) On January 26, the Wuhan Small Animals Association (Wuhan Small Animals Association) issued a notice on animal assistance to stranded domestic partners during epidemic control.
据武汉小动物保护协会（下文简称“武小协”）统计，仅26号和27号两天向该协会发来的求助信息多达400条。
Wuhan Association for the Protection of Small Animals (hereinafter referred to as "Wuxiao Association") statistics, only the 26th and 27th days of the Association sent up to 400 help messages.
而该协会平均每天能处理的求助信息却只有50条左右。
On average, the association handles only about 50 calls a day.
截止到2月2号，每天仍有大量的求助信息纷至沓来。
As of February 2, a flood of help poured in every day.
3个组，11个人，每天早上八点开始处理求助者的信息，杜帆带着他的10个队友，每天穿梭在武昌、汉口、汉阳。
Three groups, 11 people, began processing the caller's message at 8 a. m. Every day, Du Fan and his 10 teammates shuttled through Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang.
原本熙熙攘攘的武汉街头在封城以后出现了久违的宁静，公共交通停运，只能靠自己，杜帆调侃说：“即使在街上横着走都没人管你”。
The hustle and bustle of Wuhan streets after the closure of the city after a long quiet, public transport shutdown, have to rely on themselves, Tu Fan mocked: "Even if you walk sideways in the street nobody cares."
武汉封城以后的几天，阴雨连绵。
Wuhan after the closure of a few days, continuous rain.
杜帆原本已经打算停下手头的志愿活动，可是武汉解封遥遥无期，城里的人出不去，城外的人进不来，留汉的宠物面临被饿死的境况，很多饲主开始联系武小协。
Du Fan had been planning to stop the voluntary activities, but Wuhan unsealed the endless, people can not get out of the city, people can not enter the city, left the pet situation to starve to death, many owners began to contact Wusai.
杜帆原来的计划被打破了，“不能干等着”，杜帆上下协调，在1月26号发出公告称可以免费为留汉的宠物投食。
Tu Fan's original plan was broken, "can not wait," Du Fan up and down coordination, January 26 issued a proclamation that can be free of charge to stay in the pet.
仅仅两天时间，求助信息就远超杜帆的预期，这下麻烦大了，人手不够。
In just two days, the help message far exceeded Du Fan's expectations, which led to trouble and a shortage of staff.
疫情越来越严重，武汉告急。
The epidemic is getting worse and Wuhan is in urgent need.
杜帆决定还是保持原来的11个人的团队，集中处理求助信息，按照“已经断粮的优先”原则，排出个顺序来，然后再开始联系求助人、开锁公司，经过求助人允许以后再请开锁公司打开门，给宠物投食以后再在求助人的见证之下锁好门，这才能走。
Du decided to maintain the original 11-person team, concentrate on the help information, according to the "no food priority" principle, ranked in order, then began to contact the help, unlock the company after the request for permission to open the door, after the pet under the help of the witnesses locked the door, this can go.
武汉小动物保护协会上门救助留汉宠物即使已经如此小心，还是少不了受点委屈。
Wuhan small animal protection association door-to-door assistance to stay in China pets even if they have been so careful, or must be wronged.
志愿者都已经在门口了，有些求助人却因为开锁费用的问题而放弃救助，眼睁睁看着已经饿得奄奄一息的宠物被饲主放弃。
Volunteers are already at the door, but some are giving up because of the cost of unlocking them and seeing their famished pets abandoned by their owners.
是活着还是饿死，取决于一扇门，门里头是一条命，门外头是冷冰冰的钱。
To be or not to be, depends on a door, in which there is a life, and on the outside there is cold money.
早8点，晚11点，每天15个小时的时间和生命赛跑。
Eight in the morning, eleven in the evening, 15 hours a day running against life.
武汉封城之后，众多商家也推出了有偿喂猫的业务，常有商家在社交软件上发一些关于留汉宠物不幸去世的图文。
Wuhan after the closure of the city, a number of businesses have also introduced paid cat feeding business, often on social software on the unfortunate death of some left-hand pets graphics and text.
1月26号，一位外卖小哥称临收工时接了一单，饲主请求帮忙照顾自家留汉的宠物猫，等他进门以后发现猫咪已经产仔，不幸的是猫仔已经全部死亡。
A take-out brother said on January 26 that he had received a request from a breeder to take care of his family's pet cat at the end of the day. When he walked in, he found the cat had given birth.
他在微博上写道“刚进屋，眼镜雾蒙蒙，看不清，以为地上是死老鼠，结果竟然是死掉的猫仔。
"After entering the room, his glasses were foggy and he couldn't see clearly. He thought the ground was a dead rat and it turned out to be a dead cat," he wrote.
主人在微信语音时泣不成声。
The master sobbed as he microphoned.
”伤害它们的不止谣言1月29号，李兰娟院士接受央视采访。
More than just rumors of their harm, Li Lanjuan academician gave a CCTV interview on January 29.
采访中被问到了“人会传染宠物吗？”、“宠物会染病以后传染给人吗？”等问题。
The interview was asked "will people infect pets?", "pets will infect people after infection?" and other issues.
李兰娟院士的回答是“如果宠物没有接触病人，没有接触可疑的感染的人，那这个宠物是没有病的，检疫是健康的，那是没有关系的。
Academician Li replied, "If the pet has no contact with patients, no contact with suspected infections, then the pet is not sick, quarantine is healthy, that does not matter.

”“如果宠物接触到疫情了，或者接触到有感染的人了，那宠物一样要监控起来。
"If a pet is in contact with an outbreak, or someone infected, the pet has to be monitored.
”一时间，网络上出现了大量的“宠物也会感染新型肺炎”的文章和视频，不少宠物主在接收到此种信息之后，不是选择保护好宠物，而是“果断”丢掉宠物。
For a while, there were articles and videos of pets getting infected with the new pneumonia, and many pet owners, instead of choosing to protect their pets, dropped them "decisively."
甚至有地方政府发布捕杀动物的文件。
There are even local authorities that issue documents to kill animals.
宠物究竟会不会传染疫情？世界卫生组织在1月29号的发布中写道“没有证据显示狗猫等宠物会感染新型冠状病毒。
"There is no evidence that pets such as dogs and cats are infected with the new coronavirus," the World Health Organization (WHO) said in a statement released on January 29.
与宠物接触后，用肥皂和水洗手可以显著减少其它常见细菌在宠物和人类之间的传播。
Hand washing with soap and water after contact with pets can significantly reduce the spread of other common bacteria between pets and humans.
”《人民日报》在1月29号的文章中写道“目前没有证据表明这次的冠状病毒会传染给猫狗。
"There is no evidence that this coronavirus will infect cats and dogs," the People's Daily wrote on January 29.
”截止2月2号，武汉小动物协会接到的求助信息达700多条，救助行动没有因为疫情的持续而停止。
As of February 2, the Wuhan Animal Association had received more than 700 calls for help, and the relief efforts had not been halted by the outbreak.
故梦的打算是在2月初能做一些推文，把这些天的成果展示给大家，呼吁更多人关注小动物，希望未来能获得一些资助，以救助、收养更多的流浪动物。
The dream is to do some tweeting in early February, to show the results of these days, to call more attention to small animals, and hope to get some help in the future to save and adopt more stray animals.
