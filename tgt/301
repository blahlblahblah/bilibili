多位医学专业人士提醒：双黄连口服液对新型冠状病毒肺炎的疗效迄今无有力证据，公众不必抢购，不要乱吃药文 |《财经》记者 赵天宇 孙爱民编辑 |王小1月31日晚间，新华社官方微博“新华视点”发布消息，称“上海药物所、武汉病毒所联合发现中成药双黄连口服液可抑制新型冠状病毒”。
A number of medical professionals warned: Shuangwanglian oral liquid on the new coronavirus pneumonia has so far not strong evidence, the public do not have to rush to buy, do not indiscriminately eat medicine & # 160; & # 45; Wang Xiaoxiao, official Xinhua News Agency, said late January 31, "Shanghai Medicine Institute and Wuhan virus jointly discovered the Chinese patent medicine Shuanghuanglian oral liquid can inhibit new coronavirus."
消息一出，无数民众连夜抢购各种双黄连口服液，线上线下迅速销售一空，但更多医生和学者抛出大量质疑，认为这事儿不靠谱。
News, numerous people snapped up a variety of Shuanghuang oral liquid overnight, online and offline quickly sold out, but more doctors and scholars have thrown a lot of doubt that this matter is unreliable.
这则消息来自中国科学院上海药物研究所和武汉病毒所的联合研究。
The news comes from a joint study by the Shanghai Institute of Medicine of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Wuhan Virus Institute.
据“新华视点”的消息称，上海药物研究所启动了由中国科学院院士蒋华良牵头的“抗新型冠状病毒感染肺炎药物研究应急攻关团队”，在前期SARS相关研究和药物发现成果基础上，聚焦针对该病毒的治疗候选新药的筛选、评价和老药新用研究。
The Shanghai Institute of Medicine launched the "Emergency Response Team for Drug Research on Coronavirus Infection Pneumonia," led by Academician Jiang Hualiang of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, focusing on the screening, evaluation and new use of new drug candidates for the virus on the basis of previous SARS-related research and drug discovery results.
2月1日，《财经》记者致电蒋华良，他对双黄连口服液一事未做回应便匆匆挂断，“抱歉我正在开会，我没空看邮件，我现在不接受任何采访，没有时间讲这些东西”。
On February 1, Caijing reporter called Jiang Hua-liang, he did not respond to Shuang Huanglian oral liquid to hang up, "I am sorry I am in a meeting, I do not have time to read e-mail, I do not accept any interviews, there is no time to talk about these things."
“就像当年SARS疫情时一样，作为国家科研团队，这时候理应出来筛选药物。
"As with the SARS epidemic, it's time for a national research team to come out and screen for drugs.
”中科院上海药物研究所一名参与筛选药物的科研人员接受《财经》记者采访时表示，“但是不应该把本属于基础研究范畴的内容，这么大规模的释放给公众，况且这一进展还没发表过论文、没经过同行评议。
"But we should not release to the public on such a large scale what is already part of basic research, and this progress has not been published or peer-reviewed," Caijing told Caijing, a researcher involved in screening drugs at the Shanghai Institute of Medicine.
在疫情中想要给民众希望，就要给100%确凿的，否则失望会更大。
In order to give hope to the population in the midst of the epidemic, 100 per cent must be given credence, or disappointment will be greater.
”按1月29日世界卫生组织（WHO）所言，到目前为止，还没有专门用于预防和治疗新型冠状病毒的药物。
As the World Health Organization said on January 29, there are as yet no drugs specifically designed to prevent and treat the new coronavirus.
未走学术流程，请公开实验信息在“新华视点” 1月31日22点46分发出微博后，2月1日上午10点左右，《财经》记者在某医药电商网站查询，多个生产厂、多种规格的双黄连口服液，都已断货。
Before going through the academic process, please disclose the experimental information. At around 10: 00 a.m. on February 1, "Caijing" reporter inquired on the website of a medical and electrical merchant and several factories and varieties of Shuanghuanglian oral liquid were out of stock.
这次抢购潮随即引起医药行业热议。
The rush sparked heated debate in the pharmaceutical industry.
“有什么证据能够让他这么说话呢？”清华大学法学院卫生法研究中心特聘研究员卓永清质疑说。
"What evidence can get him to talk like this?" questioned Zhuo Yongqing, a special research fellow at the Center for Health Law at Tsinghua University School of Law.
业内普遍建议：没事不要乱吃药。
General industry advice: nothing to take drugs.
双黄连口服液是一种中药，属于非处方药（OTC），在药店就买得到，不需要医生开处方。
Shuanghuanglian oral liquid is a kind of Chinese medicine, belongs to non-prescription drugs (OTC), can be bought in pharmacies, do not require a doctor's prescription.
适应症与功能主治为：疏风解表，清热解毒，用于外感风热所致的感冒，症见发热、咳嗽、咽痛。
Indications and functions of the main treatment: Breathing table, heat and detoxification, used for external cold caused by wind heat, symptoms of fever, cough, sore throat.
该功能也是药典中对该药的描述。
This function is also described in the Pharmacopoeia.
国家药监局资料显示，中国目前此药共有13个生产批号，其中最早的批号是2014年哈尔滨中药四厂有限公司获得。
According to the State Administration of Pharmaceutical Supervision, there are 13 batches of the drug in China, the earliest of which was obtained by Harbin Traditional Chinese Medicine Four Plant in 2014.
按照“新华视点”微博所述，目前双黄连口服液已在上海公共卫生临床中心、华中科技大学附属同济医院开展“抑制新型冠状病毒”的临床研究。
According to Xinhua Perspectives, Shuang Huanglian Oral Liquid has been carried out in Tongji Hospital, affiliated with the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
《财经》记者查询公开的临床试验信息，目前双黄连口服液并无任何临床研究在进行，无论是新冠肺炎或其他疾病。
Caijing reporter enquires open clinical trial information, at present Shuang Huanglian oral liquid does not carry on any clinical research, whether new crown pneumonia or other diseases.
国家药监局药品审评中心的药物临床试验登记与信息公示平台上，以及国际临床试验网站Clinical Trials.gov 上，都没有查到任何相关的临床研究。
No clinical studies have been found on the Drug Clinical Trials Registration and Disclosure Platform of the Drug Review Center of the National Drug Administration, nor on the International Clinical Trials.gov, an international clinical trial site.
一款药，在允许被人类服用之前，要经历一个相当长的验证过程。
A drug goes through a fairly long validation process before being allowed to be taken by humans.
药品处方组成、工艺、药学、药剂学、药理、毒理学的研究。
The composition, process, pharmacology, pharmacy, pharmacology and toxicology of drugs were studied.
药物试验先要经过动物实验，常见的就是小鼠试验，还要经过人体的三期临床试验。
The drug trials go through animal experiments, often in mice, and then through a three-phase human clinical trial.
Ⅰ期临床试验主要验证安全性；Ⅱ期临床试验，初步探索治疗结果，观察患者身上的疗效、 副作用(安全性)及用法等；Ⅲ期临床试验则更加严格，药品必须具有明确的疗效标准，以及安全性评价标准，且必须采用统计学方法加以估计，参与试验者在300例—1000例不等。
Phase I clinical trials mainly verify safety; phase II clinical trials, which initially explore treatment results, observe the efficacy, side effects (safety) and use of patients; phase III clinical trials are more stringent, drugs must have clear efficacy criteria, and safety evaluation criteria must be estimated using statistical methods, with participants ranging from 300 to 1,000.
上述所有步骤皆通过后，这个药品送药监部门审批，过审后才能上市应用。
After all the above steps have been adopted, this medicine sent to the Department of Medicine for approval, after the review before the market application.
这也是国际通行的做法。
This is also an internationally accepted practice.
但是，中药的获批上市缺乏上述论证过程。
However, the approval of Chinese medicine market lacks the above-mentioned argumentation process.
大多数中药说明书中，“毒副作用”“不良反应”等项目还是“尚不明确”，说明临床试验研究还不够深入。
In most Chinese herbal instructions, items such as "toxic side effects" and "adverse effects" are still "unclear," suggesting that clinical trials are not well developed.
现在市场上的中成药，一部分没有做过临床试验就上市，也有一些虽做过临床试验，但不够深入。
Some of the proprietary Chinese medicines on the market are now on the market without clinical trials, and some have undergone clinical trials, but not enough in depth.
早在1987年，为了让中药走向现代化，中国开始推广中药上临床试验，陆续有约1700个中药保护品种做过临床试验。
As early as 1987, to modernize Chinese medicine, China began to promote clinical trials of traditional Chinese medicine, with about 1,700 Chinese medicine-protected varieties in clinical trials.
但迄今，没有一种中药通过美国食品和药品监督管理局（FDA）的认证，以处方药的形式在美国销售。
But so far, no Chinese medicine has been sold in the United States in the form of prescription drugs, certified by the Food and Drug Administration.
中科院上海药物研究所一名参与筛选药物的科研人员接受《财经》记者采访时也坦陈，“不应该把本属于基础研究范畴的内容，这么大规模的释放给公众，况且这一进展还没发表过论文、还没经过同行评议。
In an interview with Caijing, a researcher at the Shanghai Institute of Medicine of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who was involved in screening drugs, admitted: "There should be no release to the public on such a large scale that would otherwise be part of basic research, and this progress has not been published or peer-reviewed."
”据中国新闻网旗下公众号“国是直通车”，被问及临床试验前期是否有相关试验数据，中国科学院上海药物所的相关人士回答说，“我这边没有，我不知道，我现在没办法回答您这个问题。
Asked if there were experimental data available in the early stages of clinical trials, the relevant personage at the Shanghai Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences replied, "No, I don't know, I can't answer that question right now.
”其实，此次“中成药双黄连口服液可抑制新型冠状病毒”的消息，并非毫无先兆。
In fact, the news that the Chinese patent medicine Shuanghuanglian oral liquid can inhibit the new coronavirus is not without warning.
“新华视点”称，2003年“非典”期间，上海药物所左建平团队率先证实双黄连口服液具有抗SARS冠状病毒作用，十余年来又陆续证实双黄连口服液对流感病毒(H7N9、H1N1、H5N1)、严重急性呼吸综合征冠状病毒、中东呼吸综合征冠状病毒具有明显的抗病毒效应。
During SARS in 2003, the left Jianping team of Shanghai Pharmacopeia took the lead in confirming that Shuanghuanglian Oral Liquid has an anti-SARS coronavirus, confirming that Shuanghuanglian Oral Liquid has an obvious antiviral effect on influenza virus (H7N9, H1N1, H5N1), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.
上述研究人员告诉《财经》记者：双黄连含有的药材是金银花（中医处方又常叫双花）、黄芩、连翘，“这个成药据说是上世纪70年代，黑龙江的一个西医临床医生，从《温病条辨》里的一个名方里挑选三味药组成的”。
"This patent medicine is said to have been made by a Western medical clinician from the Heilongjiang area in the 1970s," Caijing told Caijing.
在使用50年后，《财经》记者注意到，该药仍然缺乏能够有效论证上述结论的详细数据及科研论文。
After 50 years of use, Caijing noted that the drug still lacked detailed data and scientific papers that could effectively validate the findings.
不属于新冠肺炎诊疗方案用药双黄连口服液，在中国的家庭用药中很常见。
Shuanghuanglian oral liquid, which is not part of the new crown pneumonia diagnosis and treatment regimen, is common in China.
虽然是感冒药，但这种常见药跟这次的新型冠状病毒肺炎治疗并没有多大关系。
Although it is cold medicine, but this common medicine and the new coronavirus pneumonia treatment does not have much to do with.
目前通用的新冠状病毒诊疗指南试行第四版中，有中医治疗的章节内容，但是全篇完全未提及过“双黄连口服液”。
There is a chapter on TCM treatment in the fourth edition of the new coronavirus diagnosis and treatment guide, but there is no mention of "Shuang Huanglian Oral Liquid."
新指南是1月27日国家卫健委办公厅、国家中医药管理局办公室发布。
The new guidelines were issued on January 27 by the office of the National Health Commission and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine.
根据国际咨询公司弗若斯特沙利文的报告，双黄连口服液按2017年的批发价值计，市场占有率在中国感冒类中成药市场约4.6%。
According to a report by Frost Sullivan, an international consultancy, Shuanghuanglian Oral Liquid has a market share of 4.6% of China's cold-like proprietary Chinese medicine market at the wholesale value for 2017.
双黄连口服液的市场规模超过10亿元。
Shuanghuanglian oral liquid market size exceeds 1 billion yuan.
《财经》记者查询，目前涉及双黄连口服液的上市公司共5家，A股有4家，哈药股份（600664.SH）、太龙药业（600322.SH）、珍宝岛（603567.SH），以及天士力（600535.SH）持股45%的河南天地药业股份有限公司；港股1家，福森药业（1652.HK）。
According to Caijing, there are 5 listed companies involving Shuang Huanglian Oral Liquid, 4 listed companies with A shares, Harvest Shares (600664.SH), Tailong Pharmaceutical (600322.SH), Treasure Island (60357.SH) and Henan Tianshi (600535.SH) 45%; Hong Kong shares, Foson Pharmaceutical (1652.HK).
截至2月1日收盘，福森药业单日涨5.34%。
As of February 1, Forsyn was up 5.34% a day.
弗若斯特沙利文称，自2016 年初以来，中国双黄连口服液市场的主要市场参与者，如太龙药业和福森药业，已经数次提高各包装类型的双黄连口服液的出厂价格。
According to Frost Sullivan, the main market participants in the Chinese Shuanghuanglian oral liquid market, such as Tai Long Pharmaceutical and Fosen Pharmaceutical, have raised the factory price of Shuanghuanglian oral liquid of various packaging types several times since the beginning of 2016.
然而，以往市场竞争剧烈且市场高度分散，加之其他剂型的竞争，双黄连口服液的市场仍受限。
However, the market for Shuanghuanglian oral liquid remains limited in the past because of the fierce competition in the market and the high degree of market dispersion.
比如，哈药股份在2019年半年报中说，双黄连口服液销售收入较以往同期下滑幅度较大，原因在于广告效应下降，以及竞品低价逼抢市场等因素。
For example, in its 2019 semiannual report, Hutchison reported that sales of Shuang Huanglian's oral liquid declined significantly over the same period last year, due to falling advertising effects and low prices for competing products.
除了双黄连口服液，与双黄连相关的其他剂型还有双黄连片、双黄连颗粒、双黄连栓、双黄连胶囊、双黄连糖浆、双黄连注射液等。
Besides Shuanghuanglian oral liquid, other dosage forms related to Shuanghuanglian tablets, Shuanghuanglian granules, Shuanghuanglian capsule, Shuanghuanglian syrup, Shuanghuanglian injection, etc.
按照太龙药业披露的数据，双黄连口服液的毛利率约在50%左右。
The gross margin for Shuangghuanglian oral liquid is about 50%, according to figures disclosed by the company.
双黄连口服液确实进入了一些疾病的防治预案中，或也是此次公众容易轻信并抢购的原因之一。
Shuanghuanglian oral liquid has indeed entered the prevention and treatment of some diseases, or the public easy to trust and buy one of the reasons.
太龙药业2018年年报显示，其主导产品双黄连口服液被国家卫计委纳入到《甘肃省甲型流感中医药防治预案(2017 版)》推荐中成药。
The 2018 annual report of Tai Long Pharmaceutical Industry shows that its leading product Shuanghuanglian oral liquid by the National Health and Planning Commission into the "Gansu A influenza Chinese medicine plan (2017 version)" recommended proprietary Chinese medicine.
卓永清在接受《财经》记者采访时表示，新冠肺炎没有什么特效药可医，抢购双黄连口服液是杯弓蛇影的表现，“大家就像拉住了一根救命稻草，不管它吃了以后怎么样。
Zhuo Yongqing told Caijing that there was no specific cure for Newcastle pneumonia. Buying Shuanghuanglian oral liquid is a sign of weakness. "It's like pulling a straw, no matter what it eats.
