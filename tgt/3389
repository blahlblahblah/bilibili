随着新冠疫情在欧洲多个国家暴发，各国政府为防控疫情扩散纷纷给出应对措施。
With the outbreak of the new crown epidemic in many countries in Europe, governments have proposed measures to prevent the spread of the epidemic.
英国首相鲍里斯 · 约翰逊（Boris Johnson）召开第三次紧急内阁会议，在会后就正在蔓延的新冠病毒发表声明：表示英国正式进入防疫第二阶段——拖延（delay）。
Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, convened his third emergency cabinet meeting, after which he issued a statement on the spreading new crown virus: "Britain is officially entering the second phase of immunization - delay."
此前，由于意大利急剧恶化的疫情状态，以及英国输入型病例的增加，让英国的感染人数出现了快速上升的趋势。
Earlier, the UK has seen a rapid rise in the number of infections due to the country's rapidly deteriorating health situation and an increase in imported cases in the UK.
因此，英国政府公布了完整的防疫计划，以应对疫情的蔓延，具体措施包括 4 个阶段：围堵、拖延、研究和减损。
As a result, the British Government has announced a comprehensive vaccination plan to address the spread of the epidemic, comprising four phases: containment, delay, research and mitigation.
从鲍里斯宣布进入第二个 “拖延” 阶段时，就意味着英国的疫情有进一步恶化的趋势，出现广泛的社区传播，需要考虑进行“社会隔离”。
From Boris's announcement of a second "delay" phase, there has been a further worsening of the epidemic in the UK, with widespread community transmission and the need to consider "social isolation."
目前，英国共有 10 人死于新冠肺炎，总确诊数为 596 例，相较于前日的 456 例新增 140 例。
So far, 10 people have died of pneumonia, a total of 596 cases, up 140 from 456 the day before.
尽管防疫第二阶段本预计将采取 “社会隔离” 的措施，但在发布会上鲍里斯表态暂时不会关闭学校，“根据科学建议，停课弊大于利。
Although phase II of the epidemic was expected to involve "social isolation," Boris said at the conference that the school would not be closed for the time being, "according to scientific advice, suspension would do more harm than good."
”但宣布将禁止学校安排学生出国旅行，同时建议 70 岁以上的老年人和有既存健康问题的人近期避免出行。
But the announcement would prohibit schools from arranging for students to travel abroad, while advising people over 70 and those with pre-existing health problems to avoid traveling in the near future.
针对有新冠肺炎症状的人群，从 3 月 13 日开始，所有出现咳嗽、发烧等相关症状的人必须在家隔离 7 天。
From March 13, all people with cough, fever and other related symptoms had to be kept in isolation for seven days.
如果症状在 7 天之后没有好转或进一步恶化，则需要拨打电话获取医疗帮助。
If the symptoms do not improve or worsen after 7 days, a telephone call is required for medical assistance.
此外，英国政府将改变新冠疫情检测规则，将检测重点放在症状比较严重的患者身上，对于只有轻微症状的人建议在家自行隔离。
In addition, the British government will change the rules for detecting the outbreak, focusing on patients with more severe symptoms and suggesting isolation at home for people with only mild symptoms.
图 | 英国首相鲍里斯 · 约翰逊在发布会上（来源：BBC）早在 3 月 10 日，世界权威医学期刊《柳叶刀》杂志主编、英国皇家内科医学院和医学科学院的院士理查德 · 霍顿 （Richard Horton）就在社交媒体上对英国政府没有更早采取 “拖延” 疫情蔓延行动的的决定感到遗憾，他表示：“这或许可以理解，但这是一个错误。
"This may be understandable, but it was a mistake," Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of The Lancet, the world's leading medical journal, and a member of the Royal College of Medicine and the Academy of Medical Sciences, regretted on social media that the British government had not "delayed" the outbreak earlier, saying: "It may be understandable, but it was a mistake.
正如一位英国流行病学家告诉我的那样，他们的决定非常令人失望——英国本应立即采取更积极的社会疏远措施。
As one British epidemiologist told me, their decision was disappointing - Britain should have taken more aggressive social alienation measures immediately.
”“英国政府——马特 · 汉考克（Matt Hancock，卫生大臣）和鲍里斯 · 约翰逊声称他们是在遵循科学。
"" The British government - Matt Hancock (Minister of Health) and Boris Johnson - claimed they were following science.
但事实并非如此，有很明显的证据显示，我们需要紧急执行社会隔离与相应关闭政策。
But that is not the case, and there is clear evidence that we need to urgently implement social isolation and corresponding closure policies.
目前，政府是在和公众赌轮盘，这是一个重大错误。
For now, the government is betting the public on the roulette wheel, which is a big mistake.
” 理查德 · 霍顿说道。
'said Richard Holden.
而当 3 月 12 日鲍里斯就新冠疫情发表完最新阶段的声明之后，理查德 · 霍顿更是在社交媒体上连发 9 贴，表达自己对新阶段防疫措施的不满，以及自己的态度。
And, following Boris "statement on the latest phase of the outbreak on March 12, Richard Horton posted nine social-media posts expressing his dissatisfaction with the new phase of the epidemic and his attitude.
图 | 理查德 · 霍顿 9 条推文的首个内容（来源：Twitter）首先，对于“我们对新冠病毒的反应是对英国国内正在发生的事情进行基于证据的评估”的表示，理查德认为：“这是另一个重大错误。
Richard Horton's first of nine tweets (source: Twitter) First, Richard Richards says that "our response to the new crown virus is an evidence-based assessment of what is happening in the UK."
英国的应对措施需要从中国和意大利的经历中吸取教训，而并不只是基于英国当下的情况。
The UK's response needs to learn from the experiences of China and Italy, not just from the UK's current situation.
政府似乎忽视了来自其他地方的最重要证据，简直令人难以置信。
It is incredible that the Government seems to ignore the most important evidence from elsewhere.
”随后，理查德 · 霍顿给出了一篇发表在《柳叶刀》杂志的 “新冠病毒与意大利：接下来会怎样” 的论文链接，并表示这篇论文就是他为何在有意大利前车之鉴的情况下，对英国政府的自满态度如此不满的原因。
Richard Horton then linked a paper published in The Lancet's The New Crown Virus and Italy: What Next, and said the paper was why he was so dissatisfied with the British government's complacency in the wake of Italy's precedent.
“上周日，一些意大利的作者打电话给我，向我解释了他们在本文中记录的紧急、悲惨和令人担忧的情况。
"Last Sunday, some Italian writers called me and explained to me the urgent, tragic and worrying situation they have documented here.
”他说。
'he said.
图 | 3 月 12 日发表在《柳叶刀》的关于意大利疫情的论文截图（来源：The Lancet）关于新型冠状病毒，理查德 · 霍顿表示自己并不想危言耸听。
Richard Horton said he didn't want to sound alarmist about the new coronavirus, a screenshot of the Italian epidemic published March 12 in The Lancet.
“但看一看意大利的经历吧，这里有一些重要的教训。
"But look at the Italian experience, here are some important lessons.
英国政府要么没有意识到，要么忽视了。
The British government is either unaware of it or neglecting it.
”他说，“即使是意大利政府下了如此勇敢决心，并作出了相应行动，实际上也是不足以应对疫情的。
"Even with such courageous determination and action on the part of the Italian government, it is not enough to deal with the epidemic," he said.
”“意大利卫生系统的能力可能不足以应对重症监护床位需求的指数级增长，”他说，“而这一点，英国在事实上和意大利也是类似的。
"The capacity of the Italian health system may not be sufficient to cope with the exponential growth in the demand for intensive-care beds," he said.
”按照疫情当下在意大利的增长速度，到 3 月 14 日，意大利的症监护病床的容量将达到最大。
Italy will have the largest capacity of infirmary beds by March 14, according to the epidemic's current growth rate in Italy.
更糟糕的是，需要重症监护的病人数量不会停止增长。
Worse, the number of patients in need of intensive care will not stop growing.
而在重症病患数依旧上升的情况下，如果不采取紧急行动，意大利的局势将变得 “难以控制”，并且是“灾难性” 的。
And without urgent action, Italy's situation will become "unmanageable" and "disastrous," while the number of patients with serious illnesses continues to rise.
为了避免英国发生一场 “无法控制的灾难”，理查德呼吁：“我们需要对未来几周可能发生的事情保持诚实。
"We need to be honest about what is likely to happen in the next few weeks," Richard called to avoid a "catastrophe beyond our control."
” 他表示，英国需要紧急增加重症监护能力，NHS（National Health Service，英国国家医疗服务体系）目前还没有准备好。
He said the UK needed to urgently increase its intensive care capacity and that the NHS was not ready.
“我今天（3 月 12 日）去了一家医院，他们已经有 19 名新冠肺炎患者住在了医院的重症监护病房（ITU）里了。
"I went to a hospital today (March 12) and they have 19 new cases of pneumonia in the intensive care unit (ITU) of the hospital.
”他建议人们认真地读一读刊登在最新一期意大利报纸上的这句话，再仔细想想——“重症监护专家已经在考虑拒绝为病情最严重的病人提供救生服务，并在决定向谁提供呼吸设备时优先考虑那些最有可能存活下来的病人。
He suggests that people carefully read the phrase, published in the latest Italian newspaper, and think again - "Intensive care specialists are already considering refusing to provide life-saving services to the most seriously ill patients and giving priority to those most likely to survive in deciding to whom to provide breathing equipment."
”随后，有网友回复他道：“请冷静，这并不是要杀谁，而是被迫做出的将会困扰他们的决定。
"Then a netizen replied," Calm down, it's not about who to kill, it's about being forced to make decisions that will bother them.
这个系统根本就不适合管理病人，是参考大规模伤亡的战争时期的区分标准。
The system is simply not suited to managing patients, and refers to the criteria for distinguishing between mass casualties in wartime.
这不是年龄歧视，也不是什么其他歧视，只是在有限的资源下，做出的选择。
This is not age discrimination, nor is it discrimination, but a choice made with limited resources.
”但这似乎刺激到了理查德 · 霍顿，他紧接着发布：“再次重申：我不是危言耸听。
But it seemed to stimulate Richard Holden, who then released: "Again, I'm not alarmist.
意大利发生的事情都是真实的，而且正在发生。
What is happening in Italy is real and is happening.
我们的政府（英国）没有让大家为这一现实做好准备。
Our government (Britain) has not prepared everyone for this reality.
我们需要立即采取果断的社会隔离与封闭政策，我们需要 NHS 做好准备。
We need immediate and decisive social isolation and closure, and we need the NHS ready.
这是一个非常严肃的请求。
This is a very serious request.
”图 | 9 条推文内容之一：再次重申并非危言耸听（来源：Twitter）在最后，理查德 · 霍顿表示：英国目前正处在一场本可避免的灾难的边缘。
At the end of the day, Richard Horton says: Britain is on the verge of an avoidable disaster.
“除了可以通过更积极的政府行动来防控疫情，并避免死亡之外，医护工作者还将承受来自政府骄傲自满的冲击。
"In addition to more aggressive government action to control the epidemic and avoid death, health-care workers will be hit by complacency," he said.
”他强调道，“在伦巴第大区（意大利疫情最严重的地方），已有 20% 的医护工作者被感染，有些人甚至已经死亡。
"In Lombardy [the worst affected part of Italy], 20 percent of health-care workers have been infected and some have even died," he said.
” BBC 新闻在报道中也针对英国第二阶段 “拖延” 代表什么的内容中表示，“新型冠状病毒正在英国蔓延，预计将出现大规模疫情。
"The new coronavirus is spreading in the UK and a large-scale outbreak is expected," BBC News said in a statement about what the UK's second phase of "delay" stands for.
最坏的情况是，如果什么都不做，80% 的人会被感染。
At worst, if nothing is done, 80 per cent of the population will be infected.
”对于 “学校是否会停课，以及公众集会会被禁止吗” 的问题，英国政府未来可能会采取包括停课（但需要新法律通过或教师出现短缺）、限制使用公共交通工具、停止大聚会，以及支援紧急服务部队，比如让警察专注于最严重的犯罪和维持公共秩序等措施。
The question of whether schools will be closed and public meetings banned is likely to be addressed in the future, including suspension of classes (though new legislation is needed or there are shortages of teachers), restrictions on the use of public transport, the cessation of mass gatherings, and support for emergency services, such as focusing police attention on the most serious crimes and maintaining public order.
不过，BBC 也表示：“意大利等其他一些国家已经采取了其中一些措施，但往往因为它们的病例更多。
However, the BBC also said: "Other countries such as Italy have taken some of these measures, but often because they have more cases.
”此外，也有部分英国官员对上述措施的效果表示担忧。
In addition, some UK officials have expressed concern about the effectiveness of the measures.
例如，虽然关闭学校可以减少人员聚集，但这将迫使家长呆在家中。
For example, while closing schools can reduce the number of people who congregate, it forces parents to stay at home.
这会是一个问题。
That would be a problem.
因为可能会导致可工作的医护人员数量减少，或者让祖父母这样的高危群体介入到更大的风险中。
This may lead to a reduction in the number of available health-care workers or the involvement of high-risk groups, such as grandparents, at greater risk.
而《彭博》新闻社发表的对英国政府决议的解读则更为犀利，其表示：“鲍里斯 · 约翰逊政府公布的防疫策略就是减缓病毒的传播，但并不是完全控制住。
A more incisive reading of the British government's decision was published by Bloomberg News, which said: "Boris Johnson's administration has announced a preventive strategy to slow the spread of the virus, but it is not entirely under control.
随后大多数人会被感染，有部分人会感到难受，但几乎所有人都会康复。
Most people will get infected and some will feel sick, but almost everyone will recover.
随即，在人群中有足够比例的人已经患过该疾病，则会让国家得到群体免疫力。
Subsequently, a sufficient proportion of the population has already suffered from the disease, giving the country group immunity.
”图 | 《彭博》的新闻截图（来源：Bloomberg 官网）此前，DeepTech 在采访采访了流行病学专家、牛津大学终身教授陈铮鸣时，他曾表示：“中国实施的部分措施在英国同样可行，但有些不可行，并且社会成本过高。
"Some of the measures China has implemented are equally feasible in the UK, but some are not feasible and costly to society," DeepTech said in an interview with Chen Ming, a lifelong professor at Oxford University and an epidemiologist.
除伦敦之外英国的人口密度较低，这对疫情防控相对有利。
Britain has a relatively low population density outside London, which is relatively good for disease control.
同时，英国的社区是开放性的，没有小区围栏划分，所以无法像中国那样对小区实行封闭式管理。
At the same time, the British community is open, there is no plot fence division, so China can not implement the closed management of the small area.
另外，民众可能也不答应。
In addition, the population may not respond.
”至于英国疫情在未来会如何发展，鲍里斯 · 约翰逊在发布会曾说：“英国正处于四个星期之前意大利的情况。
"Britain is in the situation in Italy four weeks ago," Boris Johnson told a news conference.
”希望在包括《柳叶刀》主编这样的权威科学家发声之后，会让英国更为谨慎并且积极地应对疫情，以避免未来出现类似意大利一般的情况。
Hopefully, an authoritative scientist, including the editor of The Lancet, will make the UK more cautious and responsive to the epidemic, to avoid a similar situation in Italy in the future.
目前，英超老牌劲旅阿森纳的球队主教练已被确诊为新冠肺炎，另外还有其他球队的球员出现疫情相应症状被隔离，英足总将在 3 月 13 日讨论联赛暂停的问题。
The FA will discuss the suspension on March 13 after the Premier League's old club Arsenal manager has been confirmed with pneumonia and other players have been quarantined.
疫情给英国带来的影响已在各处缓慢显现，希望能够正视疫情的风险，避免鲍里斯在发布会上所说的——“对于许多家庭来说，他们可能会提前面临亲人间的生离死别之痛。
The epidemic's impact on Britain is already slowly unfolding everywhere, and it is hoped that Boris will be able to confront the risks of the epidemic and avoid what Boris said at the conference: "For many families, they may face the pain of separation ahead of time.
