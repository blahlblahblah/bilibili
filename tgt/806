Reporter: Wu Bo "in the absence of transactions, 70% of brokerage firm clearly said cash flow will not last more than half a year.
”今年初，“新冠”疫情来势汹汹，房地产行业也面临一次大考。
The property sector also faced a big test at the start of the year as the new crown raged.
此次疫情对于房地产行业具体影响，暂时只能通过数据测算和调查预估一二。
The specific impact of the epidemic on the real estate industry, temporarily only through data estimates and surveys to estimate 12.
近日，贝壳研究院采用“中值回归法”，并参照“非典”对当年市场的扰动，对2020年房地产市场影响进行预判；同时联合中房经联发起《2020年新型冠状病毒对中国房产经纪影响》的问卷调查，用多个角度还原疫情之下的房产经纪行业。
In recent days, the Shell Research Institute used the "median regression method" and predicted the impact of SARS on the real estate market in 2020 in the light of the disturbance of the market that year.
贝壳研究院根据疫情发展形势三种不同假设做出预判：如果疫情2月底结束，则2020年全国住宅销售面积同比降约4%；如果疫情于3月中结束，则销售同比降幅约8%；如果疫情于6月初结束，则销售同比降幅约15%。
If the epidemic ends at the end of February, residential sales nationwide will fall by about 4 percent year-on-year in 2020. If the epidemic ends in mid-March, sales will fall by about 8 percent year on year, and by about 15 percent year on year if the epidemic ends in early June.
在二手房方面，如果疫情2月底结束，将导致一季度成交面积同比下降16.6%，全年成交面积较2019年下降3.9%；如果疫情于3月中结束，将导致一季度成交面积同比下降23%，全年成交面积较2019年下降9.3%；如果疫情于6月初结束，将导致一季度成交面积同比下降28%，全年成交面积较2019年下降16.3%。
If the epidemic ends at the end of February, it will lead to a 16.6% year-on-year decline in the first quarter and 3.9% year-on-year. If the outbreak ends in mid-March, it will lead to a 23% year-on-year decrease and 9.3% year-on-year.
接受中房经联、贝壳研究院采访专家的主流判断，一季度市场交易量将下滑，市场在疫情过后仍将持续低迷。
Accepts the Central Housing Federation, shell research institute interviews the expert mainstream judgment, the market volume will decline in the first quarter, the market will continue to be depressed after the epidemic.
不过，“非典”期间，疫情的影响主要在3、4、5月。
However, during SARS, the impact of the epidemic was mainly in March, April and May.
5月初随着疫情拐点出现，降幅收窄，市场开启修复。
Early in May, with the outbreak of the inflection point, the decline narrowed, the market opened to repair.
6月份之后，市场销售环比变动与前两年基本吻合。
After June, the market sales ring changes with the previous two years are basically the same.
贝壳研究院指出，疫情会对市场造成一定影响，但不会改变行业的基本面，房地产依旧是巨量行业，困难只是暂时的。
The shell Institute says the epidemic will have an impact on the market, but will not change the industry's fundamentals, real estate is still a huge industry, difficulties are only temporary.
尽管长期持乐观态势，房地产经纪行业短期内经营压力也不容忽视，需要经营者根据疫情迅速做好风险管理，实施应对之策。
Despite the long-term optimistic situation, real estate brokerage industry short-term operating pressure can not be ignored, operators need to do a good job in accordance with the epidemic risk management, implement countermeasures.
问卷调查显示，房产经纪公司现金流承压，离职率预期增强，现金流短缺，七成经纪公司撑不过半年，八成经纪公司处境艰难。
Questionnaire survey shows that real estate brokerage companies cash flow pressure, the expected increase in turnover, cash flow shortage, 70% of brokerage firm can not last six months, 80% brokerage companies are in a difficult situation.
春节假期叠加疫情，导致交易停摆、收入显著减少与门店租金和人工成本的刚性支出的矛盾激化，经纪公司现金流承压，经营困难。
The superimposition of the epidemic during the Spring Festival has led to a halt in trading, a significant reduction in revenues and stiff spending on store rents and labour costs, with cash flow pressures on brokerage firms and operating difficulties.
在无交易情形下，七成经纪公司明确表示现金流撑不过半年；而考虑到11%的经纪公司选择不确定，按照其他选项的平均分布，预计近八成经纪公司处境艰难。
In the absence of a deal, 70% of brokerage firms explicitly say that cash flow will not last more than six months; given that 11% of brokerage firms choose uncertainty, roughly 80% of brokerage firms are expected to be in a difficult position based on an even distribution of other options.
受到疫情波及，经纪行业从业者复工难度增大。
Affected by the epidemic, brokerage industry workers to return to work more difficult.
问卷调查显示，接近九成经纪人开展业务受到明显影响，超六成认为其撑不过6个月；73%经纪人表示由于无法正常开展带看、匹配、撮合，担忧作业难度将增大，加之经纪人普遍为流动人口，67%经纪人表示回岗难度增大，因此超一半经纪人预期收入将显著减少，无交易情形下，约六成经纪人无法坚持半年。
Nearly 90 percent of brokers were significantly affected by the survey, with more than 60 percent believing they would not last six months. About 73 percent said they could not hold out for six months because of difficulties in matching, matching and matchmaking, and 67 percent said it would be more difficult for brokers to return to work.
总体来看，行业普遍预期疫情之后修复周期约一个季度以内，但中小经纪公司和疫区从业者更悲观。
Overall, the industry is generally expected to recover from the epidemic within about a quarter of a quarter, but small and medium-sized brokerage firms and workers in affected areas are more pessimistic.
61%从业者行业预期疫情冲击可在一个季度内消除，但从规模来看，中小品牌主由于经营困难，对未来的预期更悲观，59%的中小经纪公司和店东认为疫情之后修复周期在一个季度以上。
Sixty-one per cent of the industry expects the epidemic to be eliminated within a quarter, but in terms of scale, small and medium-sized brand owners are more pessimistic about future expectations due to operational difficulties, with 59 per cent of small and medium-sized brokerage firms and shop owners perceiving a recovery cycle of more than a quarter after the outbreak.
此外，疫情持续时长也是影响行业信心的重要变量，湖北从业者行业信心明显不足，64%疫区从业者认为修复周期在3个月以上，远高于非疫区的38%。
In addition, the persistence of the epidemic is also an important variable affecting confidence in the industry in Hubei Province, where 64 per cent of practitioners believe that the recovery period is more than three months, well above 38 per cent in non-endemic areas.
面对现金流吃紧、人员流失加剧的经营困境，房产经纪机构最期望获得租金优惠，其次是弹性薪资政策。
Faced with tight cash flow and increased staff turnover, real estate agents are most eager to get rent concessions, followed by flexible salary policies.
根据问卷调查，75%的房产经纪机构期望获得明确的租金优惠政策；59.7%的经纪机构希望得到与员工可协商的灵活薪资政策支持，按比例或延迟发放，在提供员工一定薪资保障的基础上降低人工成本支出；而54.7%的经纪机构希望得到企业所得税、房产税等优惠。
According to the questionnaire, 75 per cent of real estate agents expect a clear rent policy; 59.7 per cent want flexible salary policy support that can be negotiated with employees, proportional or delayed payments, and lower labour costs based on a guaranteed level of pay for their staff; and 54.7 per cent of brokerage agencies want to receive corporate income tax, real estate tax, etc.
此外，在其他情形中，月供延缓、提供经营贷成为主要诉求。
In addition, in other cases, the principal claim is for a stay of monthly payments and the provision of operating loans.
