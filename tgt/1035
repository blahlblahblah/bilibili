Renowned by AT & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
刘嫂是北京郊区的一名莓农，她所在的兴寿镇，距离北京中心区域直线距离仅35公里，以盛产本地草莓闻名，经过数十年的发展，已经拥有了“京郊草莓第一镇”的名号。
Mrs Liu, a berry farmer from a suburb of Beijing, lives in Xingshu, a 35-kilometer-long straight line from the heart of Beijing. Known for its native strawberries, she has developed over the decades into the "Strawberry First Town on the outskirts of Beijing."
根据《农民日报》报道，目前兴寿全镇草莓种植5300多栋（栋，指一个大棚），产量5500吨，产值达2.1亿元。
More than 5,300 strawberries are now grown in Xingshou town, with a output of 5,500 tons and a production value of 210 million yuan, according to the Farmers Daily.
这一组数据的背后，是一个个像刘嫂这样的小种植户们的共同成果——他们大多来自外地，在此租种大棚。
Behind this set of data are the common achievements of small-scale farmers such as Sister-in-law - most of whom come from outside the country and rent large sheds.
刘嫂告诉《棱镜》，往年春节这段时间，是草莓园最热闹的时候，驾车来采摘的、上门来收购的，络绎不绝。
Sister-in-law told Prism, Spring Festival in previous years, is the most busy strawberry orchard, driving to pick, door-to-door acquisition, stream.
今年受疫情的影响，草莓园冷清了不少。
Strawberry orchards have been left untouched by the outbreak this year.
于是，各路人马、各种方法齐上阵，只为了将尽可能多的新鲜草莓卖出去，送到“吃货”们的手中。
So, the passers-by, various ways to join the battle, just in order to sell as many fresh strawberries as possible, to "eat" the hands of the people.
兴寿草莓在兴寿种草莓第一年种草莓就碰上疫情这种特殊情况，刘嫂一家一开始有点措手不及。
Xingshou strawberry in the first year of growing strawberries on the outbreak of this special situation, the sisters-in-law was a bit caught off guard at first.
一年前，在儿子小刘的安排下，刘嫂和丈夫从老家河北沧州来到兴寿，开始了草莓种植之路。
A year ago, under the arrangement of her son Liu, she and her husband came to Xingshu from their hometown of Cangzhou, Hebei Province, and started strawberry cultivation.
大学毕业的小刘在北京的一家互联网公司工作，他考察了一圈后得出一个结论：种草莓风险比较低，顶多不挣钱，但赔钱比较难。
Liu, a college graduate who works for an Internet company in Beijing, looked around and came to the conclusion that strawberries are less risky, less profitable at best, but harder to lose.
在兴寿镇看了几个草莓园之后，他最终选择在沙坨村租了两个大棚，年租金为2万元。
After seeing several strawberry orchards in Xingshu town, he finally chose to rent two huts in the village of Shituo, at an annual rent of 20,000 yuan.
一个大棚年租金1万元，是兴寿草莓园的市场价。
The annual rent of a large shed is 10,000 yuan, is the market price of Xingshou strawberry orchard.
种草莓是一项辛苦活儿，很多兴寿本地人选择将大棚租给外地人，租金旱涝保收。
Growing strawberries is hard work, and many local people choose to rent the shed to outsiders, rent dry waterlog.
刘嫂向《棱镜》介绍，她所在的这个草莓园中，来自河北邯郸、张家口、沧州等地的人承包占大多数，本地人自己种植的比例不到一半。
She told Prism that people from Handan, Zhangjiakou, Cangzhou and other places in Hebei Province made up the majority of the people in the strawberry garden.
除去租金，一个大棚需要种植5000多株草莓苗，一株一块钱；另外，棚顶的塑料膜需要每年更换，加上肥料等其他开支，一个大棚一年的固定投入在2万多元，产量在2000斤左右。
In addition to the rent, more than 5,000 strawberry plants are planted in a shed at a cost of one dollar each. In addition, the plastic film on the roof of the shed needs to be replaced annually, plus other expenses such as fertilizer.
按照20多元/斤的均价计算，正常情况下，一个大棚一年的纯收入在2万元左右。
Based on the average price of 20 yuan / catty, under normal circumstances, a large shed a year's net income of about 20,000 yuan.
与他们同在一个草莓园的小艳今年租了6个大棚，是该园里承包大棚最多的租户。
With them in a strawberry orchard, Xiao Yan this year rented six huts, is the garden's largest contractor barn tenants.
33岁的她已经是这里的老租户了，从2013年起就从老家邯郸来此种草莓，一种就是7年。
The 33-year-old is an old tenant. She has been living in Handan for seven years since 2013.
小艳家的草莓大棚从一开始慢慢摸索到现在，小艳去年租的四个棚一共卖了20万元，纯收入几万元，她觉得很知足。
Xiao YanJia strawberry shed from the beginning slowly to find now, Xiao Yan last year rented a total of four tents sold 200, 000 yuan, net income of tens of thousands of yuan, she felt very satisfied.
在距离小艳4公里之外东庄村，她的老乡小翠租了10个大棚，属于“散户”种植中的大户。
Four kilometers away from Xiao Yan Dongzhuang village, her townsman XiaoCui rented 10 huts, belong to the "retail" in the cultivation of large.
小翠也是一名85后，2014年在老乡的介绍下，找亲戚朋友借了十万块钱作为投入，举家来到兴寿种草莓。
Cui is also an 85, in 2014 under the introduction of villagers, asked relatives and friends to borrow 100,000 yuan as input, the whole family came to Xingshu strawberry.
她至今仍清楚地记得，那一年农历9月份就下雪了，由于缺乏经验，草莓花全部冻黑了。
She still vividly remembers that year when it snowed in September of the lunar calendar, and all the strawberry flowers were frozen black because of lack of experience.
好在，最后本钱还是卖回来了，“就是白干了一年，收集了经验。
Fortunately, in the end the cost of selling back, "is to work for a year, the collection of experience.
”此后，小翠的生意一年比一年好，而小翠也盘算着今年会有个好收成——草莓喜欢温暖的环境，大棚里保持25℃的温度最佳，今年算暖冬，所以产量不错。
Since then, Cui's business has grown better every year, and Cui is counting on a good harvest this year - strawberries love a warm environment, with a 25-degree temperature in the shed and a warm winter, so production is good.
把草莓卖出去如今，刘嫂小翠小艳们都面临着如何把草莓卖出去的问题。
Sell Strawberries Now, Sister-in-law Cui is faced with the problem of selling strawberries.
草莓一般11月份开始陆续上市，一直能采摘到第二年的5月份。
Strawberries usually begin to appear in November and can be picked until May of the following year.
每年春节期间是采摘的高峰，小艳记得她往年一天要接待二三十户上门采摘的家庭，今年受疫情影响，大家都不敢出门了，这些天一户上门采摘都没有。
Every Spring Festival is the peak picking, Xiaoyan remember that her usual day to receive 20 or 30 door-to-door picking families, this year affected by the epidemic, we dare not go out, these days not a door-to-door pick.
上门自己采摘的价格也由去年的40—50元/斤，降到了现在的30元/斤。
The price of door-to-door picking has also dropped from 40 to 50 yuan per catty last year to 30 yuan per catty.
按照小艳的说法，去年她年前的两个月就已经回本了，但今年到现在本金才回了不到一半。
According to Xiao Yan, she had returned the money two months before last year, but this year she has returned less than half of her principal.
小翠告诉《棱镜》，她们的草莓销售平时主要依靠三个渠道：客户上门采摘、草莓商贩上门批发，以及同城快递配送。
Cui told Prism that their strawberry sales usually rely on three channels: door-to-door picking, strawberry vendor wholesale, and express delivery with the city.
在第一种方式目前遇阻的情况下，后两种渠道成了小翠们如今绞尽脑汁发力的方向。
In the case of the first approach, which is currently blocked, the last two channels have become the direction in which Cui's brain is struggling.
事实上，此前仅草莓商贩批发，就能占到小翠全部销量的三分之二。
In fact, previously only strawberry vendors wholesale, can account for two-thirds of all sales of Cui.
草莓商贩在草莓园批量收购草莓，再通过自己的渠道卖到市区，相当于一个中介的角色。
Strawberry traders buy strawberries in bulk in strawberry orchards and sell them to the city through their own channels, acting as an intermediary.
据小翠介绍，通常好几家莓农固定“养”一两个草莓商贩，在几户大棚中转着圈摘。
According to Cui, several berry farmers usually "keep" one or two strawberry vendors, in a circle around a few huts.
辛师傅(化名)就是小翠她们口中的草莓商贩，从小翠们那里收购回来的草莓，他会送到昌平固定的几个小区。
Shifu Xin (alias) is the strawberry peddler in their mouth, bought from the small Cui people, he will be sent to Changping fixed several small areas.
专做季节性水果配送的他，号称从田间地头到客户家里绝对不会超过3个小时。
He specializes in seasonal fruit distribution, said from the field head to the customer's home never more than three hours.
他告诉《棱镜》，以往他一天可以卖掉五六百斤草莓，现在受疫情的影响，销量有所下降且不稳定，但每天也至少能卖300斤左右。
He told Prism that he had been able to sell five or six hundred kilos of strawberries a day, and that sales were down and unstable due to the epidemic, but he was able to sell at least 300 pounds a day.
正是靠着这个收购渠道，刘嫂将第一茬草莓都卖了出去。
It is through this acquisition channel that Liu Sao sells the first strawberry.
但价格上，用她的说法，比成本可能还要低一点，但也比烂在地里强多了。
But the price, in her words, may be lower than the cost, but also better than rotten in the field.
另外，得益于这些年物流行业的飞速发展，顺丰、京东快递都能做到同城当日送达；加之“闪送”等同城快递也陆续兴起，使得年轻一点的小翠们的草莓，能通过快递卖到市区。
In addition, thanks to the rapid development of the logistics industry in recent years, Shunfeng, Jingdong express can be delivered on the same day, and the "flash" equivalent of city express has been rising, so that the younger Cui Cui strawberries can be sold to the city by express.
据小翠介绍，同城快递一箱4斤的草莓，顺丰的快递费为21元，京东快递为14元。
According to Cui introduction, with the city express a box of 4 jin strawberry, Shunfeng's express delivery fee is 21 yuan, Jingdong express for 14 yuan.
此外，运输草莓还需要专门定制的快递盒，一套批发价12元，算下来，一盒草莓的运输成本至少26元。
In addition, there is a special delivery box for strawberries, a set wholesale price of 12 yuan, calculated that the cost of a box of strawberries is at least 26 yuan.
但好处是，相比刘嫂低价卖给中介，小翠能保证价格，减去成本，至少略有盈利。
But the advantage is, compared to Sister Liu selling low to the intermediary, Cui can guarantee prices, minus costs, at least a little profit.
2月9日当天，小翠就快递出了十几箱草莓。
February 9, the day, Cui express a dozen boxes of strawberries.
事实上，由于保存时间短、对温度要求高、轻微的磕碰都极容易引起腐坏等一系列特点，使得草莓不适合远距离运输，这也是草莓始终没有被大规模电商化的原因。
In fact, strawberries are not suitable for long-range transportation because of a series of characteristics such as short shelf life, high temperature requirements and low kickdowns, which have always not been commercialized on a large scale.
北京农学院的孙杨在2018年一篇题为《兴寿镇草莓行业电商销售渠道现状分析》的论文中指出，根据调研兴寿镇只有8%的生产者在使用电商渠道进行销售。
In 2018, Sun Yang of the Beijing Agricultural Institute wrote in a paper entitled "Analysis of the current status of distribution channels for electric merchants in the strawberry industry in Xingshu Town." According to the survey, only 8% of producers in Xingshu are using the electric channel.
其中有两家还是通过贩卖而发展的电商，而且基本上还是属于给附近的客户运送。
Two of them have also been developed through trafficking and are still largely destined for nearby customers.
成熟待采摘的草莓“草莓团购群”来了相比较商贩收购、同城快递，客户上门采摘由于客单价最高，无需运输成本，过去一直是小艳首选的销售方式。
Mature strawberry batch to pick "strawberry group" compared to the vendor acquisition, city express, customers pick door-to-door because the highest unit price, no transportation costs, has always been Xiaoyan preferred sales.
她记得往年春节期间，一天就要接待二三十户上门采摘的家庭。
She remembers receiving twenty or thirty home-picked families a day during the Spring Festival.
于是小艳开始思考，既然现在客户无法上门采摘，那她们就将草莓摘好送过去。
So Xiaoyan began to think, since now customers can not pick the door, they will pick strawberries.
社区团购是她如今主攻的一个销售渠道。
Community shopping is now one of her main sales channels.
多年的经营让她积攒了一批回头客，由这些熟客在自己的小区群里帮她发起团购，达到一定的数量她就将草莓送到小区里。
Years of operation have allowed her to amass a steady stream of backpackers, who buy her a group in her neighborhood and send her strawberries to the community when a certain amount is reached.
往年她定的标准是50斤起送，在今年这种特殊行情下，她将起送标准降到了20斤。
In previous years she set the standard of 50 catties, in this year's special market, she will send the standard to 20 jin.
另外，在社区团购的营销上，小艳也动了一些心思，比如，对于一次性购买一箱（4斤）的客户，她会主动送一份自己种的有机蔬菜，或者鸡蛋——都是每个都市家庭用得上的食材，受到了不少客户的好评。
In addition, in the marketing of community group buying, Xiaoyan also has some thoughts, for example, for a one-time purchase of a box (4 jin) of customers, she will take the initiative to send their own organic vegetables, or eggs - all of which are useful ingredients for every urban household and have been well received by many customers.
对小翠而言，社区团购也是她青睐的一种渠道：直接将草莓从大棚里送到客户手中，能最大限度保持草莓的新鲜和口感；自己直接和客户对接，没有中间商赚差价，皆大欢喜。
For Cui, community shopping is also one of her favorites: direct delivery of strawberries from the shed to customers, keeping strawberries fresh and tasty to the maximum extent possible; and docking directly with clients without any middlemen making a big difference.
“今天（2月10日）就有一位大姐帮我在她的同事群里团购了150斤。
"Today, Feb. 10, a big sister helped me buy 150 jin in the company of her colleagues.
”小艳兴奋地说道，大家都知道今年的草莓不好卖，不少老客户一直在帮她打广告，这让小艳很感动。
"Xiao Yan excited to say, everyone knows that strawberries are not sold well this year, and many old customers have been helping her advertise, which makes Xiaoyan very moved.
《棱镜》了解到，如今类似的“草莓团购群”几乎成了每个小区的标配，十来个人就可以拼成一团。
"Prism" learned that today's similar "strawberry group" almost became the standard for every community, a dozen people can be a ball.
回龙观某小区的一位团购群主吴女士对《棱镜》表示，这样团购的草莓比从市场上买的要便宜，而且更新鲜、口感也更好，还能送货上门，她们群里几乎每周都会开团一到两次。
Ms. Wu, a group buying group owner in a district of Huilongguan, told Prism that the group buys strawberries cheaper, fresher, better tasting and delivers goods from the market, and the group meets almost once or twice a week.
家住昌平的张先生是为数不多近期去草莓园采摘的客户。
Mr. Zhang, who lives in Changping, is one of the few customers who went to strawberry orchards recently.
从莓农口中了解到草莓滞销的情况后，他特意多采了几斤带回来。
After learning from the raspberry farmers that strawberries were unsaleable, he picked a few pounds and brought them back.
尽管交通费用和采摘费用平摊下来，让他的草莓高达50元一斤，但他觉得很值：“心情的改善远比多花一点钱来得重要。
Even though the cost of transportation and picking was shared out and his strawberries topped $50 a catty, he felt it was worth it: "The improvement in mood is far more important than spending more money.
”目前，通过社区团购这种方式，小艳一天最多可以卖出上百斤草莓，虽然比不上往年旺季的销量，但也比小艳预想的要好多了。
So far, Xiao Yan has been able to sell up to 100 kilos of strawberries a day through group shopping, which is not nearly as good as the previous season's sales but much better than Xiao Yan had expected.
尤其这几天随着第一茬草莓接近尾声，市场上草莓供求关系开始发生变化，草莓价格也有明显回升的趋势。
Especially these days as the first strawberry end, the market began to change the relationship between supply and demand strawberry, strawberry prices also showed a clear trend of recovery.
帮扶草莓小镇除了莓农自己在积极拓展销售渠道之外，政府也开始采取一些助农措施。
In addition to actively expanding the distribution channels of strawberry farmers themselves, the government has started to take some measures to help farmers.
据《棱镜》了解，2月5日，昌平区农业技术推广站、土肥站、植保站的站长和副站长带队，去实地查看了兴寿莓农种植和草莓积压的情况，随后又以村为单位，将所有草莓种植户拉群，统计各家目前草莓的成熟产量。
According to Prism, on February 5, the stationmaster and vice-stationmaster of agricultural extension station, soil fertilizer station and plant protection station in Changping District led a field trip to inspect the situation of cropping and strawberry backlog.
《棱镜》在其中的一个群里看到，该村有70多户草莓种植户，根据他们的申报，每个大棚约有100-200斤草莓待销。
In one of the groups, Prism saw more than 70 strawberry farmers in the village, each of whom, according to their declarations, had about 100 to 200 catties of strawberries for sale.
此外，为了解决疫情期间农产品产销信息不对称问题，政府还开发了一款“农产品供求信息上报微信小程序”，生产企业可以上报农产品供应信息和农资需求信息，经销商可以上报农产品需求信息。
In addition, to address the asymmetry in agricultural production and marketing information during the epidemic, the government has also developed a "micro-program for reporting supply and demand information on agricultural products," whereby manufacturers can report agricultural product supply information and agricultural demand information, and distributors can report agricultural product demand information.
相关工作人员在上述群里组织莓农填写，并跟踪销售情况。
The staff concerned organized the berries in the above groups to fill in and track the sales.
草莓只是近期农产品滞销的一个缩影，在此背景下，一些大的电商平台也纷纷行动，帮助全国各地优质农产品的销售。
Strawberries are just a microcosm of the recent bad sales of agricultural products, in this context, a number of large electrical business platforms have also taken action to help the sale of high-quality agricultural products throughout the country.
据淘宝方面2月10日表示，其上线的“吃货助农”频道第一批优选了山东、四川、浙江、辽宁等六省十款滞销优质农产品，该频道上线3天，销售农产品已超过300万斤。
The first batch of 10 unmarketable quality agricultural products from Shandong, Sichuan, Zhejiang and Liaoning provinces was selected by the channel, which has sold more than 3 million pounds of agricultural products over the past three days.
拼多多也于2月10日正式上线“抗疫农货”专区，覆盖全国近400个农产区包括230多个国家级贫困县，商品囊括脐橙、苹果、草莓等各类水果和主要生鲜食材。
On February 10, Duoduo officially went on line, covering nearly 400 agricultural areas nationwide, including more than 230 poverty-stricken counties, including umbilical cord oranges, apples, strawberries and other fruits, as well as the main raw materials.
“终于有人帮我们了！”小艳告诉《棱镜》，尽管目前这些措施还没看到明显的成效，但她觉得，以一个好价格卖掉自己辛苦种植的草莓，应该不是一件难事了。
"At last someone has helped us!" Xiao Yan told Prism that although the measures have not yet seen significant results, but she felt it should not be difficult to sell their hard-grown strawberries at a good price.
