”这是东京奥组委自1月31日以来，第三次发表奥运会不会取消的声明。
It was the third time since January 31 that the Games would not be canceled.

昨天日本电视台采访出现震撼一幕，节目随后中断……17日，日本TBS的一档电视节目中，一位参加了新年会的出租车司机接受采访，受访人和首位被确诊的出租车司机参加了同一个年会，而且坐在距离他只有一桌之隔的位子上。
A Japanese taxi driver who attended a New Year's party was interviewed yesterday on a Japanese television show and was seated at a table just across the table from the first cab driver who had been diagnosed.

Drivers interviewed admitted that they had been examined the day before the interview and said they had been deemed to have been absent for two consecutive days because they had not been notified of positive results.
然而就在这时，受访司机突然接到保健中心的来电，被告知确诊为新型冠状病毒肺炎。
