被认为对肺炎有一定疗效的处方药克力芝，在一片混乱中正在脱离处方，四下流通。
The prescription drug, Kaletra, which is thought to have some effect on pneumonia, is circulating over the counter in the midst of chaos.
全文3338字，阅读约需7.5分钟“家属急需，能不能卖给我克力芝？”又一条来自新型冠状病毒感染者家属的求药信息，传送到白桦手机上。
Family members need it, can they sell it to me? "Another message from the families of the newly infected patients was sent to the birch phone.
对艾滋病感染者而言，克力芝并不陌生。
Kaletra is no stranger to people living with AIDS.
作为艾滋病用药，克力芝和其他抗艾滋病毒药物联合使用，可以有效抑制病毒复制。
As AIDS medicine, Kaletra and other anti-HIV drugs used in combination, can effectively inhibit viral replication.
因多位专家提示克力芝对新型冠状病毒肺炎可能有效，且国家诊疗方案中提及可试用克力芝治疗，在2020年这场肺炎疫情中，这款已问世20多年的抗病毒药物迎来了自己的“高光时刻”。
The more than 20-year-old anti-viral drug has taken on a "high-light moment" in the wake of the outbreak of pneumonia in 2020 after several experts suggested that the drug might be effective against the new coronavirus pneumonia, and the national diagnosis and treatment plan mentions experimenting with Kaletra.
抗艾滋病毒药物可以治疗新冠肺炎的话题登上微博热搜。
The topic of anti-HIV drugs can be treated for new crown pneumonia on Weibo Hot Search.
微博、贴吧甚至闲鱼，都有肺炎患者家属求药的信息。
Weibo, paste bar even fish, all have pneumonia family members to seek medicine information.
这是找到白桦的第五个人。
This is the fifth person to find birch.
在这之前，湖北武汉、襄阳，深圳、上海、西安的网友陆续找到这个艾滋病公益组织负责人，为感染新型冠状病毒的家属求一盒“解药”。
Before this, Hubei Wuhan, Xiangyang, Shenzhen, Shanghai, Xi'an netizens successively found the person in charge of the AIDS public welfare organization, seeking a box of "antidote" for the family members infected with the new coronavirus.
但他拒绝了所有求助，“别把它的功效想得太厉害了。
But he turned down all requests for help. "Don't think too much about its efficacy.
”到目前为止，意外走红的克力芝，对新型冠状病毒肺炎的治疗效果还没有来自循证医学的数据支撑。
So far, the unexpected success of Kaletra in treating the new coronavirus pneumonia has not been supported by evidence-based medicine.
━━━━━求药“谁还有克力芝啊，闺蜜妈妈肺炎严重，需要这种药。
2006-03-15 09: 48 Who has Kaletra, my mother has severe pneumonia, and needs this medicine.
”末末在微博紧急求助。
"At the end of the tweet.
截至1月28日24时，5974人在这场席卷全国的疫情中感染，末末朋友的妈妈也没能幸免。
As of 2400 hours on 28 January, 5,974 people had been infected by the epidemic that had engulfed the country, including the mother of the last friend.
确诊后，朋友妈妈在武汉市第七医院住院治疗，这是武汉接收新型冠状病毒肺炎患者的定点医院之一。
After the diagnosis, friends and mothers were hospitalized at Wuhan Seventh Hospital, one of the designated hospitals in Wuhan to receive patients with the new coronavirus pneumonia.
但医院克力芝紧缺。
But there is a shortage of Kaletra.
“现在都没得药，得病的要自己想办法自救了。
"There is no medicine, sick people have to find their own way to help themselves.
”她有些无力。
She was weak.
与末末同样急切的患者家属还有很多，艾滋病公益组织、贴吧，在他们能想到的所有渠道，奋力求助。
As anxious as the end of the patient's family there are many, AIDS organizations, paste, in all the channels they can think of, struggling for help.
几天前，艾滋病公益组织白桦林的微信公号后台网友留言中，新型冠状病毒、克力芝出现的频次明显增多，这让白桦感到有些反常。
Just a few days ago, the new coronavirus and Kaletra appeared more frequently in the backstage message of the birch forest, which made Betula feel a little abnormal.
不久，一名新型冠状病毒肺炎患者家属找到他，求购克力芝。
Soon, a family member of a new coronavirus pneumonia patient approached him for Kaletra.
他才意识到，社会层面对克力芝的渴求。
Only then did he realize the need for Kaletra at the societal level.
“我们一家三口都感染上了，求求你救救我们，可以买吗？”患者的求助信息涌进“松鼠哥”的微博。
"We have three people infected, please help us, can you buy it?" The patient's help information poured into the "squirrel brother" micro-blog.
他现在是克力芝的临时中转站。
He is now a temporary transit point for Kaletra.
他的手上有各地艾滋病感染者无偿捐助的40盒克力芝，还有几位病友集资购买的220盒印度仿制版克力芝，即将运抵国内。
He has 40 boxes of Kaletra donated free of charge by people living with AIDS around the world, and 220 boxes of Kaletra, an Indian imitation version, collected by several sick people and will soon arrive in the country.
加起来，足够300人药量。
Altogether, enough for 300 people.
病友委托他，把这些药全部捐助给有需要的新型冠状病毒患者。
The patient entrusted him with donating all the drugs to the new coronavirus patients in need.
捐助信息在微博公布后，不少肺炎感染者找来，重金求购。
Donation information in Weibo after the announcement, many people infected with pneumonia to find, heavy money to buy.
“不卖，凭确诊报告和药物处方免费赠送。
"No, free of charge on the basis of diagnostic reports and drug prescriptions.
”他给捐助圈定了几个限制条件：已确诊、治疗方案包括克力芝、所在医院没有药。
He imposed several restrictions on the donation: diagnosis, treatment options including Kaletra, and no drugs in his hospital.
“可以卖我点吗？我是武汉的，家里老人得了冠状病毒肺炎住不进医院，现在只能自救，听网上说克力芝可能有效果，想试试。
"Can I sell it? I am Wuhan, the family of the elderly have the coronavirus pneumonia can not enter the hospital, can only save themselves, listen to the Internet may be effective, would like to try.
恳请你帮助一下我这样一个无助的子女好吗？”在艾滋病贴吧，一位网友向自称有克力芝货源的药品代购发出乞求。
Please help me to help such a helpless child? "In the AIDS paste bar, a netizen to the self-proclaimed Kaletra source of medicine on behalf of the purchase.
“收两瓶克力芝。
"Two bottles of Kaletra.
”在HIV贴吧，网友“闲鱼有梦”也在替发烧的朋友找药。
In HIV paste, netizens "idle fish have dreams" are also looking for medicine for a feverish friend.
他的朋友没有达到医院收治条件，在家观察，想买克力芝治病。
His friends did not meet the hospital conditions, home observation, want to buy Kaletra treatment.
网友劝他，“不会是看了艾滋病药物能治肺炎那个吧，这药不能乱吃的，对身体伤害很大。
Netizens advised him, "will not be to see AIDS drugs can treat pneumonia that bar, this medicine can not eat randomly, on the body injury is very large.
”还有人想买些克力芝预防感染。
Others want to buy Kaletra to prevent infection.
对这部分求助者，“松鼠哥”并不理会。
For this part of the patron, "Brother Squirrel" did not pay attention.
之前有种说法盛传，艾滋病感染者在肺炎疫情中无人感染。
There was a rumour that people living with AIDS were not infected by pneumonia.
白桦不以为然，武汉有一位艾滋病病友就在医院通过肺部CT查出左肺有感染，但至今未确诊。
Birch disagrees, Wuhan has an AIDS patient on the hospital through the lung CT to detect infection, but so far has not been confirmed.
公益组织志愿者老四也有些看不下去，这些人把药当成淘宝上的衣服了，买的人病急乱投医，卖的人要钱不要命。
People who buy medicine as clothes on Taobao, buy people who go to the hospital in a hurry, and people who sell it ask for money for nothing.
一片混乱中，处方药克力芝正在脱离处方，四下流通。
In the midst of all the chaos, the prescription drug Kaletra is running out of prescription.
━━━━━意外克力芝的意外走红，让人始料未及。
Oct. 23 Oct. 23 The unexpected surge in Calderon's popularity was unexpected.
克力芝是蛋白酶抑制剂，包括“洛匹那韦”（lopinavir）和“利托那韦”（ritonavir）两种主要成分。
Kaletra is a protease inhibitor and includes two major components: lopinavir and ritonavir.
两种成分共同作用，可以使病毒复制产生的是不具有再生能力、非成熟形态的艾滋病毒颗粒，从而达到降低艾滋病毒载量的作用。
The combination of the two components allows the replication of viruses to produce non-regenerative, immature forms of HIV granules, thus reducing the HIV load.
作为免费艾滋病用药，艾滋病感染者可从当地疾控部门或定点治疗医院免费领取。
As a free AIDS medication, people living with AIDS can receive free of charge from local disease control departments or designated treatment hospitals.
白桦告诉记者，克力芝属于抗艾滋病毒的二线药物方案，并非主流用药。
Birch told reporters that Kaletra belongs to the anti-HIV second-line drug programme, not the mainstream drug.
虽然与其他抗艾滋病毒药物相比，克力芝不容易发生耐药，但可能出现高血脂症、腹泻等副作用，所以并不受艾滋病友青睐。
While Kaletra is less resistant than other anti-HIV drugs, it may have side effects such as hyperlipidemia and diarrhea, so it is not popular with AIDS patients.
经过几天的抢购，多名代购库存的克力芝现货已经卖光。
After several days of snapping up, many of the stock has been sold out of Kaletra spot.
一名代购告诉记者，只能从印度新德里直邮仿制版的克力芝，售价850元一盒，5至7天到货。
A buying agent told reporters that it was only possible to send a replica version of Kaletra from New Delhi, India, for $850 a box, five to seven days in advance.
有人趁机加价倒卖。
Someone is taking advantage of it.
“你知道他们最多卖多少钱一盒吗？4000！”这让白桦非常气愤。
"Do you know how much they can get for a box at most? 4000!" It made Betula angry.
“如果抗病毒药是后宫的话，克力芝应该就是娴妃吧，资历最老，一直不温不火，也不受宠的一个妃子，突然一下子逆袭当上皇后了。
"If the antiviral drug is the harem, then Kaletra should be the demure concubine, the oldest, who has been tepid and unfavored, and suddenly becomes queen.
”“松鼠哥”在朋友圈感慨。
"Brother Squirrel" was lamenting in his circle of friends.
但也并非无迹可寻。
But it's not untraceable.
1月23日，感染了新型冠状病毒的国家专家组成员、北京大学第一医院呼吸和危重症医学科主任王广发向媒体描述，一种名为“洛匹那韦/利托那韦片”的抗艾滋病毒药物对他十分有效。
On January 23, Wang Guangfa, a member of a national team of experts infected with the new coronavirus and director of respiratory and critical medicine at Peking University Hospital No. 1, described to the media an anti-HIV drug called Lopinavir / Ritonavir.
王广发提到的“洛匹那韦/利托那韦片”就是克力芝。
The "Lopinavir / Ritonavir tablet" mentioned by Wang Guangfa is Kaletra.
此后，艾滋病药物可以治疗新型冠状病毒肺炎的消息，散播开来。
Since then, AIDS drugs can treat the new coronavirus pneumonia news spread.
同样的信息也从上海传出。
The same message came from Shanghai.
上海市公共卫生临床中心是上海收治新型冠状病毒肺炎患者的定点医疗机构之一，当地的确诊病例大多数在此接受治疗。
Shanghai Public Health Clinic Center is one of the designated medical institutions for treating patients with new coronavirus pneumonia in Shanghai, where most confirmed cases are treated.
1月24日，该中心党委书记卢洪洲向外界表示，“我们从第一个患者开始，就使用了克力芝这一类抗艾滋病的药物，从目前来看，还是有一定的效果，但还需要更多的临床观察。
"We have been using an anti-AIDS drug like Kaletra since the first case, but we still need more clinical observation," party secretary Luhong Zhou told reporters on January 24.
”HIV贴吧吧主小严清楚记得，贴吧里出现的第一条求助信息就出现在1月24日。
HIV paste! "The first sign of help appeared on Jan. 24, as Master strict clearly remembers.
他发现后很快删除了。
He found it and deleted it quickly.
随后，又陆续出现了不少求购克力芝的帖子，还有代购游走其间，借机推销。
Subsequently, there have been a number of Cricket purchase posts, there is also a shopping around the interim, the opportunity to promote.
他已经删除了大部分求药帖，并且封禁了违规ID。
He has removed most of the requests and banned the offending ID.
对于删帖，他有自己的理由，克力芝是国家免费药品，不能用来流通，而且克力芝作为处方药，也必须要有医生的处方才能购买和使用，如果贸然使用有可能引起急性胰腺炎。
He had his own reasons for the expurgation: Kaletra was a national free drug that could not be used in circulation, and Kaletra, as a prescription drug, had to be prescribed by a doctor in order to be purchased and used, which could lead to acute pancreatitis.
在高度紧绷的时刻，任何风吹草动，都会引发意想不到的蝴蝶效应。
In times of high tension, any wind blowing will trigger an unexpected Butterfly Effect.
1月29日上午，中科院武汉病毒所发出消息称3种老药物在细胞层面上对新型冠状病毒有抑制作用，其中就包括克力芝的成分之一：利托那韦。
On the morning of January 29, the Wuhan virus of the Chinese Academy of Sciences sent a message saying that three old drugs, including Ritonavir, one of the components of the coronavirus, were inhibiting the new coronavirus at the cellular level.
很快，白桦就收到了志愿者转来的求药信息：有这些药吗？武汉有网友感染了，想买。
Soon, birch received a request for medicine from the volunteers: Do you have these drugs? Wuhan has infected the netizens, want to buy.
求药者附上了武汉病毒所这一最新发现的媒体报道截图。
Drug seekers have attached a screenshot of the Wuhan Virus Institute's latest discovery.
白桦理解这种恐慌。
Birch understands this fear.
但他劝告，疑似感染者一定要到正规的医院问诊并按医生的建议用药。
But he advised that suspected infected people must go to a regular hospital to consult a doctor and follow the doctor's advice on medication.
克力芝毕竟是处方药，而且也有一定的副作用，服用后需要定期随访，没有服用过的人不要擅自用药。
After all, Kaletra is prescription drugs, but also have certain side effects, need to follow up regularly after taking, not to take unauthorized medication.
━━━━━疗效发出求助信息的当天，末末搞到了5天份量的克力芝。
HealingsBy the end of the day when the message of help was sent out, a five-day supply of Kaletra had been obtained.
但没能阻止朋友妈妈病情的恶化，高烧不退，精神也越来越差。
But failed to prevent the deterioration of friends and mothers, high fever, the spirit is also more and more bad.
从理论上看，新型冠状病毒与艾滋病毒同属RNA病毒。
Theoretically, the new coronavirus belongs to the same RNA virus as HIV.
两种病毒的蛋白酶有类似性，所以克力芝作为蛋白酶抑制剂可能对两者有效。
The proteases of the two viruses are similar, so Kaletra may be effective as a protease inhibitor for both.
记者查阅发现，在国家卫健委连续下发的新型冠状病毒分肺炎诊疗方案中，提到“抗病毒治疗可试用洛匹那韦/ 利托那韦（200 mg/50 mg，每粒）每次 2 粒，每日二次。
The reporter looked up and found that in the new-style diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus distributed by the National Fitness and Health Commission, it was mentioned that "antiviral therapy can be tried on Lopinavir / Ritonavir (200 mg / 50 mg, each tablet) two tablets twice a day.
”外界据此解读为，克力芝是国家推荐用药。
Kaletra has been interpreted as a state-recommended drug.
但试用，并不等于推荐。
But a trial is not a recommendation.
“是试用，这是没有办法的办法。
"" Try it. There's no way out.
”北京协和医院感染内科主任、中华医学会感染病分会候任主任委员兼艾滋病学组组长李太生是艾滋病治疗领域的专家，他对克力芝治疗新型冠状病毒肺炎的效果持观望态度。
Li Taisheng, director of infective medicine at Beijing Concoronavirus Hospital and chairman-designate of the Infectious Diseases Branch of the Chinese Medical Association, is an expert in the field of AIDS treatment.
在新型冠状病毒治疗中被捧上神坛的克力芝，还没有来自循证医学的数据支撑。
Kaletra, who has been hailed as a god in the new coronavirus treatment, has no data support from evidence-based medicine.
李太生曾经参与SARS疫情防控。
Li Taisheng was involved in SARS prevention and control.
他回忆说，克力芝是20年前研发出来的药物，所以在SARS和MERS爆发时都有人尝试过，但疗效证据不明确。
Kaletra was a drug developed 20 years ago, he recalls, so people tried it when SARS and MERS broke out, but the evidence of efficacy is unclear.
“当时，有7篇文献显示没有效果，只有回顾性研究说可能有效。
"At the time, there were seven papers that showed no effect, only a retrospective study said it might work.
所以总体来说，现在还没有特别确凿的证据。
So, on the whole, there is no particularly conclusive evidence.
”李太生认为，尽管这一药物被加入了国家诊疗指南推荐，但具体使用时间和治疗效果还需要经临床进一步证实。
Although the drug is recommended in national guidelines, the timing and effectiveness of the treatment need to be clinically confirmed, Li said.
武汉大学中南医院感染科教授、著名艾滋病防治专家桂希恩也持保留态度。
Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital infection department professor, well-known AIDS prevention and treatment expert Guixian also has reservations.
他认为，新型冠状病毒感染目前尚无特异性治疗手段，治疗以综合治疗为主，但推测对其他RNA病毒有效的药物可能对本病有效，例如克力芝。
He said there was no specific treatment for the new coronavirus infection. The treatment was based on combination therapy, but it was assumed that other RNA virus-effective drugs, such as Kaletra, might be effective against the disease.
不过，其有效性及安全性、合适的剂量、疗程及可能的作用机制，尚待探索。
However, its efficacy and safety, the appropriate dose, the course of treatment and the possible mechanism of action have yet to be explored.
对于健康人群求购克力芝用于预防新型冠状病毒，李太生直言，“没有必要。
For healthy people to buy Kaletra used to prevent the new coronavirus, Li Taisheng said bluntly, "No need.
”他告诉记者，目前武汉的临床专家已经开始了克力芝的对照研究。
He told reporters that clinical experts in Wuhan had begun a comparative study of Kaletra.
