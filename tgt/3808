新冠疫情的蝴蝶效应，到底是怎么一步步发酵，最后形成了当前这场威力惊人的龙卷风？点击图片，一键下单「全球经济 熔断时刻」主笔 | 谢九3月9日，美国股市暴跌熔断之后，“股神”巴菲特表示，自己活了89岁也没有见过这样的场面。
How did the Butterfly Effect of the New Crown finally grow into a powerful tornado? Click on a picture and click on a single button to say "The Meltdown of the Global Economy." On March 9, Buffett says he hasn't seen anything like this since he was 89 years old.
谁也想不到的是，接下来的两周之内，美国股市还会发生两次熔断，而且跌幅一次大过一次。
To no one's surprise, there will be two more meltdowns, one more than one, in the next two weeks.
在美国股市的带动之下，全球已经有10多个国家的股市惨遭熔断。
Stock markets in more than 10 countries around the world have been battered by the U.S. stock market.
新冠疫情的杀伤力之大，让我们都有“幸”见证了历史。
The new crown disease's lethality is big, lets us all have "lucky" to witness the history.
新冠疫情的蝴蝶效应，到底是怎么一步步发酵，最后形成了当前这场威力惊人的龙卷风？当疫情早期主要集中在中国的时候，除了A股市场短暂大跌之后，全球资本市场对于疫情的反应基本上波澜不惊。
The Butterfly Effect of the New Crown Epidemic, how the current power of the tornado gradually ferment, when the early stage of the epidemic mainly concentrated in China, except for a short collapse in the A-share market, the response of global capital markets to the epidemic was largely uneventful.
在国际投资者看来，疫情只是短期和局部影响，所以，疫情的冲击力仅仅只是局限于中国的A股市场。
In the eyes of international investors, the epidemic is short-term and local, so the impact of the epidemic is limited to China's A-share market.
2月12日，中国当天的确诊人数高达1.5万多人，美国股市还创出了历史新高。
On February 12, more than 15,000 people were diagnosed in China on the same day, and the U.S. stock market hit an all-time high.
转折点出现在2月下旬，中国的确诊人数快速下降，但是中国之外的确诊人数却开始明显上升，疫情出现了全球化扩散的迹象。
While the number of confirmed cases in China fell rapidly in late February, the number of confirmed cases outside China began to rise markedly, and the epidemic is showing signs of spreading globally.
这个时候，美国股市开始出现了一定的恐慌情绪，尤其是2月25日以来，中国之外的新增确诊人数首次超过了中国境内，疫情全球化趋势基本确定，美国股市从最高点回落了12%，这对11年长牛的美国股市而言并不多见。
This comes at a time when the U.S. stock market is starting to show some panic, especially since February 25, when the number of newly diagnosed cases outside China surpassed that of China for the first time, and the trend towards globalization was largely confirmed, with US stocks falling by 12 per cent from their peak, a rarity for the 11-year-old US stock market.
但这还只是冰山一角。
But this is only the tip of the iceberg.
新冠疫情的冲击力开始扩散到原油市场，由于担忧疫情带来原油需求下降，沙特为首的欧佩克希望和俄罗斯达成更大力度的减产协议，但是被俄罗斯拒绝，随后沙特采取了“增产加降价”的毁灭式报复行为，国际油价大跌三成。
The impact of the new cap epidemic began to spread to crude markets, and OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, sought a stronger production cut with Russia, fearing a drop in oil demand, but Russia rejected the move, followed by a devastating Saudi retaliatory "increase plus reduction" that saw international oil prices plummet by 30%.
油价史诗级的暴跌，引爆了美国股市，3月9日，美国股市大跌超过7%，创下了历史上第二次熔断。
The epic collapse in oil prices triggered US stock markets, which plunged by more than 7 per cent on March 9, the second meltdown in history.
投资者惊魂未定，仅仅3天之后，美国股市再次熔断，这一次，不仅是股市等风险资产暴跌，传统的避险资产黄金、日元、瑞郎甚至美国国债都开始下跌。
Investors panicked, and just three days later, US stocks collapsed again, this time, not just in risky assets such as equities, but also in traditional risk-averse assets - gold, yen, Swiss franc, and even US Treasuries.
覆巢之下无完卵，市场之惨烈前所未见。
There is no perfect egg under the coverlet.
3 月5日，沙特能源大臣阿卜杜勒-阿齐兹·本·萨勒曼参加欧佩克第178 届特别会议。
On 5 March, the Saudi Minister of Energy, Abdul-Aziz Bin Salman, participated in the 178th special session of OPEC.
在连续两次熔断之后，美联储终于坐不住了。
After two consecutive meltdowns, the Fed is finally sitting on its feet.
3月15日，美联储大幅降息100个基点，降至0-0.25%的历史低位，同时还启动了7000亿美元的量化宽松。
On March 15, the Fed slashed interest rates by 100 basis points to an all-time low of 0-0.25 per cent, and launched $700 billion in quantitative easing.
过去几年，特朗普屡屡对美联储主席鲍威尔施压，不惜以换人为要挟，要求美联储放松货币政策，但鲍威尔都顶住了压力。
In the past few years, Trump has repeatedly pressured US Federal Reserve Chairman Colin Powell to loosen monetary policy by threatening to change hands, but Powell has resisted pressure.
而这一次，美联储一夜之间打光了所有子弹，反应之大超出市场预期。
This time, the Fed wiped out all the bullets overnight, more than the market had expected.
美联储用力过猛，反而吓坏了市场。
The Fed overdid it, scaring the markets.
投资者担心如果以后经济形势继续恶化，美联储已经没有武器可用，而且，美联储反应如此激烈，投资者反而开始担心这是不是意味着美国经济的衰退程度超出了想象。
Investors were worried that if the economy continued to deteriorate, the Fed would no longer have weapons, and that the Fed would react so aggressively that investors began to worry if it meant the economy would decline more than they had imagined.
所以，美联储放出大招之后，3月16日，美国股市再次熔断，主要股指的跌幅超过了12%。
So, in the wake of the Fed's big move, on March 16, the U.S. stock market again fell by more than 12%.
3月9日，美国纽约证券交易所外。
March 9, outside the New York Stock Exchange.
今天我们谈论起美国历史上著名的股灾，通常都会提到1929年和1987年这两个年份。
Today we talk about the famous stock market disasters in American history, usually referring to the years 1929 and 1987.
1929年10月份，美国股市在连续两个交易日的跌幅都超过了10%，拉开了美国股灾的序幕，也成为30年代美国大萧条的开端。
In October 1929, the U.S. stock market fell more than 10% for two straight trading days, marking the beginning of the U.S. stock market crash and the Great Depression of the 1930s.
1987年那一次，美国股市在一个交易日内的跌幅就超过了20%，创下了美国股市最大的单日跌幅纪录。
In 1987, the U.S. stock market fell more than 20% in one trading day, the biggest one-day decline in U.S. stocks.
而美国股市最近在两周之内3个熔断，注定了将和前两次股灾一样载入史册，在未来很多年后被后人不断提及。
And the recent meltdown of the US stock market in two weeks is bound to go down in history like the last two, and will be mentioned many years later.
一场新冠疫情创下了美国乃至全球股市暴跌的历史性事件，疫情对经济的杀伤力到底有多强呢？作为最早大规模爆发疫情的国家，中国已经交出了一份初步的答卷。
China, the first large-scale outbreak, has handed over a preliminary response to a historic crash in the United States and global stock markets.
3月16日，国家统计局公布今年前两个月的经济数据，很多关键指标的恶化程度大大超出了市场预期。
On March 16, the National Bureau of Statistics released economic data for the first two months of the year, and many key indicators deteriorated far beyond market expectations.
消费、投资和出口三驾马车显著下滑，物价指数和失业率明显上升。
The troika of consumption, investment and exports has declined significantly, and price indices and unemployment have risen markedly.
3月7日，连云港港口码头处理进出口货物。
On 7 March, Lianyungang port terminal handled import and export cargo.
受疫情影响，进出口也受到了显著冲击。
Imports and exports have also been significantly impacted by the epidemic.
从消费数据来看，1-2月份，社会消费品零售总额5.2万亿元，同比名义下降20.5%，而去年同期是6.6万亿元，同比名义增长8.2%。
According to consumption data, retail sales of consumer goods totaled 5.2 trillion yuan in January and February, down 20.5% in nominal terms, compared with 6.6 trillion yuan in the same period last year, representing a nominal increase of 8.2%.
以绝对值来看，今年前两月的消费额下降了大约1.4万亿元，我国去年GDP总额将近100万亿元，仅仅头两个月的消费损失，占去年GDP的比重就达到了1.4%。
In absolute terms, consumption fell by about 1.4 trillion yuan in the first two months of this year. China's total GDP was nearly 100 trillion yuan last year, and the loss of consumption in the first two months alone accounted for 1.4% of GDP last year.
从投资来看，头两个月的全国固定资产投资同比下降了24.5%，前几天公布的2月份制造业采购经理指数（PMI）仅为35.7%，比上月下降14.3个百分点，不仅大大低于50%的荣枯线，也创下有记录以来的历史新低。
In terms of investment, fixed asset investment fell 24.5 per cent year-on-year in the first two months, compared with 35.7 per cent in February, down 14.3 per cent from the previous month and well below the 50 per cent benchmark, also a record low.
从进出口来看，前2个月的进出口下降了9.6%，其中出口下降了15.9%，实现贸易逆差426亿元，去年同期为顺差2935亿元。
In terms of imports and exports, exports and imports fell 9.6% in the first two months, with exports down 15.9%, achieving a trade deficit of 42.6 billion yuan, compared with a surplus of 293.5 billion yuan in the same period last year.
从头两个月的经济数据来看，今年第一个季度的GDP可能大概率会负增长，最终一季度经济增速是多少，按照统计局的说法，“要等到下个月大概这个时候才能知道和发布”。
Judging from the first two months of economic data, GDP growth in the first quarter of this year is likely to be negative, and in the final quarter it will be "about this time next month," according to the Bureau of Statistics.
17年前的“非典”，中国当年的二季度经济增速下跌了2个百分点，从一季度11.1%的增速跌至9.1%。
Seventeen years ago, when SARS hit, China's second-quarter growth rate fell two percentage points to 9.1 percent from 11.1 percent in the first quarter.
这一次，新冠疫情的冲击力显然大大超过了“非典”时期。
This time, the impact of the new crown epidemic is clearly much greater than the SARS period.
疫情对全年经济会形成多大冲击，取决于复工的进度以及政策上的对冲力度。
How much impact the epidemic will have on the economy throughout the year depends on the pace of resumption and the strength of policy hedging.
从复工来看，虽然当前国内的疫情已经基本稳定，考虑到未来反弹的可能性，以及境外输入的压力，当前很多地方对于复工依然非常谨慎。
From the resumption of work, although the current domestic epidemic has basically stabilized, in view of the possibility of a rebound in the future, as well as pressure imported from abroad, many places are still very cautious about returning to work.
3月10日，农业农村部公布的数据显示，现在还有近一半的返乡农民工没有返城复工。
On March 10, data released by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs showed that nearly half of returning migrant workers had not returned to work.
从这个数据就能大致推测出当前的实际复工程度。
From this data can be roughly inferred from the current actual degree of resumption of work.

Illustration / Fan Wei Europe became the new disaster area after the epidemic leveled off in China.
意大利、西班牙和法国已经开始全面封锁，越来越多的欧洲国家也计划实施封锁计划，这对经济的冲击自然是不言而喻。
The economic impact of the embargo on Italy, Spain and France is self-evident, as more and more European countries plan to implement it.
2008年金融危机之后，欧洲又遭遇欧债危机，过去10多年已经历经多次衰退。
After the 2008 financial crisis, Europe was hit by a European debt crisis, which has experienced multiple recessions over the past decade.
去年欧元区的经济增速只有1.3%，创下6年新低，尤其是曾经的欧洲领头羊德国，去年的增长更是仅有0.6%。
Eurozone growth last year was just 1.3 per cent, a six-year low, especially in Germany, once Europe's leader, where growth last year was only 0.6 per cent.
沦为疫情重灾区之后，欧洲经济的前景将更加黯淡。
The outlook for Europe's economy will be even bleaker after the epidemic hits hard.
作为全球经济的重要一环，欧元区经济总量占全球比重大概在16%左右，仅次于美国和中国，欧元区大幅萎缩，对全球经济自然会形成巨大拖累。
As an important part of the global economy, the euro area accounts for about 16% of the world economy, second only to the US and China.
而最值得担心的还是美国。
And the most worrying thing is the US.
作为当前的全球最大经济体，美国对全球经济的重要性不言而喻。
As the world's largest economy today, America's importance to the global economy speaks for itself.
一旦疫情在美国大规模爆发，对全球经济将形成需求侧的重大冲击，包括中国在内，全球很多国家都离不开美国的消费力。
In the event of a major outbreak in the United States, a major demand-side impact on the global economy, including China, will leave many countries, including China, dependent on US spending power.
当前美国的疫情形势也极不乐观，按照美国卫生总署负责人的说法，当前美国的疫情已经到了一个爆发的临界点，目前大概相当于两周前的意大利。
The current situation in the United States is also far from encouraging. According to the head of the US Department of Health, the current outbreak in the United States has reached a tipping point, roughly equivalent to that in Italy two weeks ago.
压力之下，美国总统特朗普也一改之前对待疫情的轻慢态度，3月16日，特朗普公布了一份美国未来15天减缓病毒传播的行为指南，要求美国人尽量在家办公，不要参加10人以上的聚会等等。
Under pressure, US President Trump also reversed his previous lethargy about the epidemic, and on March 16, Trump published a 15-day US code of conduct for mitigating the spread of the virus, requiring Americans to work from home, not to attend more than 10 parties, and so on.
同时，特朗普也首次承认，在疫情的冲击之下，美国经济有可能走向衰退。
And, for the first time, Trump has acknowledged that the US economy could be headed for recession under the impact of the epidemic.
部分国际投行预计美国二季度经济可能会负增长。
Some international investment banks forecast negative growth in the second quarter.
3月11日，世界卫生组织宣布将新冠疫情定义为“全球大流行病”。
On March 11, the World Health Organization announced that it would define the new crown as a "global pandemic."
试想一下，当美国、中国、欧洲和日本经济同时大幅放缓，对于全球经济意味着什么？而更可怕的事情是，疫情在全球范围内还在快速扩散升级，何时能够真正结束，现在几乎还看不到尽头。
Imagine what it would mean for the global economy when the US, China, Europe, and Japan all slowed sharply at the same time, and even more frightening was the fact that the epidemic was spreading rapidly around the world, and there was little end to it.
按照最普遍的预计，疫苗面世可能需要18个月，中国经济停摆两个月，就已经出现了断崖式下跌，如果要完全依靠疫苗才能结束疫情，全球经济显然承受不了长达18个月的等待。
According to the most common estimates, the vaccine could take up to 18 months, China's economy is already in a cliff-like decline after a two-month hiatus, and it is clear that the global economy cannot afford to wait up to 18 months if it is to rely entirely on vaccines to end the outbreak.
当年“非典”来势汹汹，后来又突然凭空消失，希望这一次，人类还能有好运降临。
That year, SARS came aggressive, and then suddenly disappeared out of thin air, hope that this time, humanity can have good fortune to come.

在本期#三联生活周刊##封面大使#中国社会科学院世界经济与政治研究所、全球宏观经济研究室主任张斌看来，股票市场的下跌，本身也能够反映市场投资者对未来经济前景的悲观态度，“世界经济合作与发展组织（OECD）和国际货币基金组织（IMF）也都下调了经济增长预期，OECD将2020年全球经济增速预期从2.9%下调至2.4%，如果降到2.4%，基本进入衰退了。
According to Zhang Bin, director of the World Economics and Political Research Institute and Global Macroeconomic Research Office of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the stock market's decline itself reflects market investors' pessimism about the future economic outlook.
其实在疫情冲击之前，全球经济本身就比较脆弱，疫情发生后，会有相当数量的经济体陷入负增长。
In fact, before the epidemic hit, the global economy itself was fragile, and a significant number of economies would experience negative growth after the outbreak.
