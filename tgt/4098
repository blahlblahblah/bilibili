记者/颜星悦编辑/宋建华新冠肺炎患者在美国急剧增加截至3月21日，美国确诊感染新冠病毒人数超过24,000例，日增确诊病例过7,500人，可能成为意大利之后海外疫情最严重的国家，其中纽约、华盛顿、新泽西、加利福尼亚是疫情最严重的四个州。
Reporter / Yan Xingyue Editor / Song Jianhua New Crown Pneumonia patients in the United States As of March 21, the number of people diagnosed with the new crown virus in the United States exceeded 24,000, with an increasing number of confirmed cases of 7,500.
和中国疫情爆发初期一样，美国医护人员的防护装备也遭遇了供给不足的情况，N95口罩和防护服要么已经用尽，要么没达到医学防护标准。
As in the early days of the Chinese epidemic, US health-care workers suffered from a shortage of protective gear, with N95 masks and suits either exhausted or not meeting medical protection standards.
美国疾控中心（CDC）甚至建议医护人员，用围巾或头巾临时替代口罩。
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) even recommends that health workers use scarves or headscarves to temporarily replace masks.
令医护人员感到更无力的是，他们缺乏足够的检验病毒的试剂盒。
What makes health care workers even weaker is that they lack enough test kits to test for the virus.
鉴于这种情况，美国疾控中心提高了检测标准，没有达到标准的疑似病患不能做检测。
In the light of this, the CDC has raised testing standards, and suspected patients who fail to meet standards cannot be tested.
这些标准包括：是否是老年人和患有慢性疾病和/或免疫受损状态的人、是否14天内与确认病例有过密切接触、是否14天内有疫区的旅行史。
These criteria include whether an older person and a person with a chronic disease and / or impaired immune system, whether there has been close contact with a confirmed case within 14 days, and whether there is a travel history of an infected area within 14 days.
医生应根据专业知识确定病患是否感染新冠病毒，是否应该接受检测。
Doctors should determine whether the patient is infected with the new crown virus and whether he or she should be tested.
林妍是一名在洛杉矶执业的华人护士，与国内护士的职责不同，她是一名NP（NursePractitioner，美国注册护士RN的上一个级别，负责医生的部分工作，如问诊、开药——编者注）。
Lin Yan is a Chinese nurse practising in Los Angeles. Unlike a domestic nurse, she is an NP (Nurse Practitioner, the last level of RN in the US), who is responsible for part of the doctor's job, such as consulting and prescribing drugs.
工作中，她负责决定是否给病患进行病毒检测。
At work, she is responsible for deciding whether to give her patients a virus test.
在接受北青深一度记者的采访中，她讲述了疫情下自己在医院、诊所的经历。
In an interview with a reporter from Beiqing and Shenzhen, she told of her experiences in hospitals and clinics under the epidemic.
美国时间20日，纽约市长白思豪表示，纽约已确诊5151例新冠肺炎病例，并称纽约市已成为美国疫情的“震中”CDC让我们用围巾、头巾做口罩我的工作从6点30分到达医院开始，这时离正式上班时间还有半个小时，我需要提前查看一下病人的信息，7点钟科室会开一个5分钟的简短会议，提醒当天需要注意的病人。
New York City has confirmed 5,151 cases of New York City's new crown pneumonia and said New York City has become the epicenter of the U.S. epidemic. CDC has told us to use scarves and headscarves to make face masks.
进入感染病房之前，我会穿上防护设备。
I will wear protective gear before entering the infection ward.
疫情发生之后，我们没有更改防护设备，仍然只是帽子、口罩、手套、脚套还有一个防护袍，但是防护袍不是360度无死角的，脖子、腿部是露在外面的，还有后背也可能会漏，你需要把带子系得更紧才可以。
After the outbreak, we didn't change the protective equipment. It was still just a hat, mask, gloves, foot covers and a protective robe, but it wasn't 360 degrees. The neck and legs were exposed.
接下来的12个小时，是我一天的“战斗”。
For the next 12 hours, it was my day of battle.
首先我会对我所负责病人做例行检查，然后与医生、家属进行沟通，确认病人都服过药后，再根据医嘱和病人的病情来安排自己的计划。
First, I do a routine check-up of my patients, and then communicate with my doctor and family to make sure that the patient has taken all the medication, and then plan according to the doctor's advice and the patient's condition.
美国一直有医护人员短缺的问题，大部分情况下我都很忙。
There has always been a shortage of health-care workers in the United States, and I've been busy most of the time.
每天我负责3—5个病房，12个小时连轴转。
I was in charge of 3-5 wards for 12 hours a day.
人手实在不够的时候，我们会从别的科室调人，或者请别的城市的医护临时来我们这儿帮忙。
When we are really short of manpower, we will transfer people from other departments or ask medical help from other cities to come here to help us.
午餐时间是不固定的，通常在12点到3点这之间抽半个小时去吃东西。
Lunch time is not fixed, usually between 12 and 3 o'clock between half an hour to eat.
自从美国发生第一例新冠肺炎病例开始，我就不和大家一起吃饭了。
Ever since the first case of New Crown Pneumonia in the United States, I have stopped eating with everyone.
一般我拿一些水和饼干，自己去车里吃。
I usually take some water and biscuits and eat them in the car myself.
新冠病毒可以在空气里存活3-4个小时，但我不知道自己吸进去的哪一口空气里会有病毒，我尽量尽量减少自己的风险，也减少别人的风险。
The new crown virus can live for three to four hours in the air, but I don't know which mouthful of air I inhale contains the virus.
我所在的这家医院已经有三例重症，一例死亡。
There have been three serious cases and one death in my hospital.
我之前会关注新闻，看有多少人确诊，现在我已经不想去看这些数字了，这样做只会让自己感到更害怕。
I used to watch the news to see how many people were diagnosed, and now I don't want to look at the numbers anymore. It just scares me even more.
因为疫情变得更加严重的话，我们医护是最可能先倒下的。
As the epidemic gets worse, we are most likely to fall first in medical care.
我们医院里口罩不足是一个很大的问题。
The shortage of masks in our hospital is a big problem.
我们院的疾控专家已经跟我们说，除了进感染病房，其他时间不用戴口罩。
CDC experts at our hospital have told us not to wear masks at all times except in the infection ward.
现在N95口罩越来越少了，医院也没有给护士发N95口罩，我戴的是普通医用口罩。
Now N95 masks are becoming fewer and fewer. The hospital has not issued N95 masks to the nurses. I am wearing a regular medical mask.
美国疾控中心发了公告，告诉我们医护人员，如果没有口罩的话，可以“做”：用围巾或者头巾当成口罩，遮住鼻子和嘴。
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States issued a bulletin telling us that doctors and nurses can "do" if they do not have masks: use scarves or headscarves as masks, covering our noses and mouths.
我们都感到不可思议，为什么会这样？美国冠状病毒试剂“一剂难求”（美联社）没有试剂盒，检测标准已提高每周，我有三天在医院工作，两天在诊所工作。
We all wondered why this was so? The US coronavirus reagent "One dose is hard to find" (AP) No kit, testing standards have been raised every week, I work in a hospital for three days and a clinic for two days.
诊所的一天，工作时间是8个小时，从早上8点到下午5点，8个小时之内我要接待的病人有20个左右。
The clinic operates eight hours a day, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., and I have about 20 patients in eight hours.
病人一般会提前和我预约好，分时间段来，基本上15-20分钟看一个病人。
Patients usually make an appointment with me in advance, come in time, basically 15-20 minutes to see a patient.
我在诊所执行的是医生的职责，会给病人问诊、开药。
I perform the duties of a doctor at the clinic, and I consult and prescribe medicines for patients.
在我能管控的范围之内，我会直接诊治，遇到我不确定的地方我会把病人推荐到专家医生那里。
As far as I can control, I'll see the doctor directly, And if I'm unsure I'll refer the patient to a specialist.
很多人来诊所想做新冠病毒检测。
Many people came to the clinic to have their new crown virus tested.
其中很大一部分人是因为恐慌，比如有一个来自中国东北的华人女性，她是做按摩的，可能跟好多人都有过接触，不确定自己有没有被感染。
A large number of them were panicked, such as a Chinese woman from northeast China who massaged and probably had contact with a lot of people and wasn't sure she was infected.
她没有发烧，但她觉得自己发烧了，嗓子也有点疼。
She did not have a fever, but she felt a fever and a pain in her throat.
我就让她放宽心先观察，因为只是嗓子疼的话，有很多种可能性，没法确诊。
I let her relax to observe first, because only throat pain, there are many possibilities, can not be confirmed.
很多墨西哥人现在也很恐惧，但他们反应得比较慢。
Many Mexicans are now afraid, too, but they react more slowly.
1月份就有华人陆陆续续来问检测的事情，墨西哥人可能最近这几个星期才开始意识到，然后每天都有来诊所问可不可以检测，自己到底有没有病毒。
Since January there has been a trickle of Chinese testing, and Mexicans may have begun to realize it in recent weeks, and then come to the clinic every day to ask if they could be tested for viruses.
当然，也有真的可能性感染病例。
Of course, there is also a real possibility of infection.
前两天我接到一个病人的电话，是一个30岁的女性，说她去过西雅图开会，开完会之后，发现会议上有一个人已经确诊了，最近她也有咳嗽的症状，所以想来检测。
The other day I got a phone call from a 30-year-old woman who said she had been to Seattle for a meeting. After the meeting, she found out that one of the people at the meeting had confirmed the diagnosis.
这种情况我判断她其实很有可能感染了，但我也没有给她检测。
I judged that she was probably infected, but I didn't give her a test.
美国疾控中心给我们设定的检测标准很严，只有上呼吸道症状的话，不能检测，必须要有下呼吸道症状并且去过外国旅行，或者是已经和确诊的人有过接触，才可以做检测。
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States sets very strict testing standards, only upper respiratory symptoms, can not be tested, must have lower respiratory symptoms and travel abroad, or has been in contact with a confirmed person before testing.
所谓下呼吸道出现症状，就是听肺部会不会有不正常的声音，如果有，其实这时候已经是肺炎了。
The so-called lower respiratory tract symptoms, is to listen to the lungs can have abnormal sounds, if there is, in fact, by this time pneumonia.
对于没有达到检测标准的病人，我只能开消炎药，并告诉他们，现在不用吃，如果情况三天内没有好转的话，你再吃消炎药。
For patients who do not meet the test criteria, I can only prescribe anti-inflammatory drugs, and tell them not to eat them now, if the situation does not improve in three days, you take anti-inflammatory drugs.
消炎药只能治疗细菌感染，不能杀死病毒。
Anti-inflammatory drugs can only treat bacterial infections, not kill the virus.
如果他们吃了消炎药还没有好转的话，那可能就是病毒感染了。
If they don't get better with anti-inflammatory drugs, it could be a viral infection.
我还能做的，就是建议病人呆在家里，减少外出。
All I can do is advise my patients to stay at home and go out less.
我会问他工作的地方允不允许他不去上班，如果不允许的话，我可以给他写一个医嘱给老板。
I would ask where he would work and not allow him to be absent from work, and if not, I could give him a medical advice.
我的诊所到目前为止，还没有检测到一例新冠肺炎患者。
So far my clinic has not detected a single case of New Crown Pneumonia.
这有两个原因：第一，美国疾控中心（CDC）的检测标准太高，我没办法和它死犟；第二，诊所没有试剂盒。
There are two reasons: first, the CDC test standards are too high for me to be stubborn; secondly, the clinic does not have test kits.
检测盒里会有三样东西：一个用来从口腔里取样本，一个用来从鼻腔里取样本，然后再就是抽血的工具。
There are three things in the box: one for sampling from the mouth, one for sampling from the nasal cavity, and then for blood extraction.
这种试剂盒我们诊所周四才订到30个，现在还没有到。
We only ordered 30 of these kits on Thursday, and they haven't arrived yet.
所以，其实有很多疑似病人是没有做检测的，实际感染人数可能会比美国官方报出来的数据高很多。
So there are a lot of suspected patients who have not been tested, and the actual number of infections is likely to be much higher than the official U. S. figures.
目前来说，我的城市里抽血中心是可以做检测的，我在诊所遇到符合检测标准的病人，会打电话给抽血中心，确认之后介绍病人去那里检测。
At the moment, my city's blood center is available for testing, and when I meet patients who meet the test criteria at the clinic, I call the blood center, confirm it and refer the patient there for testing.
检测出来如果真是感染的话，也还要看病人的症状，很严重的可以去医院急诊，如果不是很严重，呆在家自己治愈。
If the detection is really infected, but also depends on the patient's symptoms, very serious can go to the hospital emergency, if not very serious, stay at home to heal.
纽约公共图书馆、大都会博物馆、苹果零售店、百老汇演出等大型公共场所和活动相继关闭或取消（新华社）如果病人在旁边咳嗽，光洗手有什么用无论是在医院还是诊所，我现在下班回家的第一件事就是脱掉身上的脏衣服，放进洗衣机，然后洗澡，并把我碰过的地方用消毒纸巾擦一遍。
Large public places and events such as the New York Public Library, the Metropolitan Museum, Apple Retail Store, Broadway shows have been closed or canceled (Xinhua) If patients cough nearby, what's the use of hand washing () Whether in a hospital or clinic, the first thing I do when I come home from work is to take off my dirty clothes, put them in the washing machine, then bathe and wipe the place I have touched with sterile paper towels.
不上班的时候，我不会出门，有人给我送东西，我都让对方放在信箱里，我自己再去取。
When not at work, I do not go out, someone to send me things, I have to put each other in the mailbox, I will go to pick up.
我之前是不做饭的，现在没办法外出，就只好逼着自己做饭了，因为不会炒，所以全靠水煮。
I did not cook before, now can not go out, had to force their own cooking, because they do not cook, so rely on water boiling.
我买了很多蔬菜、肉储存在冰箱里，做饭的时候加水加火锅底料进去煮就行了。
I bought a lot of vegetables, meat stored in the refrigerator, cooking with water and hot pot ingredients to cook it.
3月19日加州州长宣布封城，他预计未来8周内，会有56%的加州人感染新冠病毒。
California's governor announced on March 19 that he expects 56 percent of Californians to contract the virus in the next eight weeks.
我听到这个消息悲伤地哭了。
I wept bitterly when I heard the news.
我不知道他的预测是怎么做出的，但我觉得是有可能发生的。
I don't know how his predictions were made, but I think it's possible.
我接触的人基本上都是做医疗行业的，有我很好的朋友，有同事，有教会我成长的一些人。
The people I come into contact with are mostly in the medical profession, with good friends, colleagues, and people who have taught me to grow up.
疫情发展到这种程度，也许会有我认识的人倒下，所以心里面会很难过的。
When the epidemic reaches this point, there may be people I know who will fall, so my heart will be sad.
他们不单单是对我很重要的人，他们更是医护工作者，如果他们要倒下了的话，他们的病人都会被影响到。
They're not just important to me, they're health care workers, and if they fall, their patients will be affected.
从美国有第一例开始，我就每天戴口罩，我常常会劝身边的美国人戴口罩，有的人听，有的人不听。
Since the first case in the United States, I have worn a mask every day, and I have often advised people around me to wear masks, some to listen and some not to listen.
美国政府总是说戴口罩没有什么用处，我真的很着急。
The U. S. government always says wearing masks is useless. I'm really worried.
如果就是告诉大家勤洗手，可是如果一个病人就在你旁边，在那里咳嗽，你疯狂地洗手，能有什么用？好在现在很多人都开始意识到了，的确需要戴口罩，因为在洛杉矶人们开始买不到口罩了，街头上人们戴的口罩奇奇怪怪，我看到有人戴万圣节的那种搞怪口罩，有的人戴那种薄薄的一次性口罩，都能看到他的鼻子和嘴巴。
If it's telling people to wash their hands often, but if a patient is right next to you, coughing there, and you're washing your hands crazily, many people are now beginning to realize that masks are needed because people in Los Angeles aren't buying masks, street people wear strange masks, I see people wearing Halloween masks, some wear thin disposable masks, and can see his nose and mouth.
因为我在医院、诊所工作，父母很担心，经常会打电话。
Because I work in a hospital or clinic, my parents are worried and often make phone calls.
这两天我的手受伤了，可以不去上班，他们松了一口气，我反倒感到内疚，因为我的同事朋友都还在前线。
They were relieved that my hands had been hurt and I could skip work for the last two days. I felt guilty because my colleagues and friends were still at the front.
我的医院里因为发现了确诊病例，有医护人员感到害怕就请假不去了。
In my hospital, because of the discovery of confirmed cases, some medical staff are afraid to leave the leave.
但我觉得在特定时间里，需要更多医护人员无私奉献。
But I think there is a need for more health care workers to be selfless at any given time.
