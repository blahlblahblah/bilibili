穿睡衣上班30天后，生活没了仪式感。

/ [^ # 39 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 116] / n. This may be the longest winter we've had in our pajamas.
为了过节做的发型已经睡平，做的指甲和接的睫毛也早就掉光，唯有睡衣，至今忠实地守护着我们。
The hair done for the holidays had fallen asleep, the nails and eyelashes had long since fallen out, and pajamas were the only ones who were watching us faithfully.
我们睡觉穿它、居家穿它。
We sleep and wear it, we wear it at home.
有时仗着戴着口罩谁也认不出谁，甚至穿着它出门倒垃圾、拿快递。
Sometimes no one can recognize anyone by wearing a mask, even wearing it to go out to take out garbage, express delivery.
当大规模居家办公开启后，睡衣更成了我们的战袍。
The pyjamas became our war robes when the massive home office opened.
01.小孟已经放弃了营造上班的“仪式感”。
Meng has given up building a "sense of ceremony" at work.
在她原本的想象中，在家上班的基本程序应该大致按以下计划执行：按时起床、换掉睡衣、吃个早餐，然后端坐在书桌前，开启一天的工作。
In her imagination, the basics of working from home should be roughly the same as getting up on time, changing pajamas, eating breakfast, then sitting at her desk for the day's work.
想象中一切都很美好，现实却困难重重。
Everything is beautiful in the imagination, but the reality is difficult.
首先，没有通勤打卡的紧箍咒，被窝变得万分难以摆脱。
First, there is no hard-to-break mantra of commuting to work, and bedding becomes extremely difficult to escape.
其次，好容易挣扎着爬起来，顶着好几天没洗的头，也基本丧失了把自己拾掇体面些的动力。
Second, struggling to get up, against a few days did not wash the head, also basically lost the motivation to tidy up their own.
理想中精致干练的居家办公职业女性，没过两天，已经无缝适应了窝在沙发上抱着电脑画表做PPT。
The ideal home office professional, within two days, has flawlessly nestled on the sofa with a computer drawing table as a PPT.
职场状态一上身，即便穿着睡衣，也丝毫不影响和客户撕X时的现场发挥。
The top of the workplace, even wearing pajamas, will not affect and customers tear X when the scene played.
“只要视频会议没有领导和客户，我可以穿一礼拜睡衣。
"I could wear pajamas for a week as long as there were no leaders or clients.
”小孟如此总结陈词道。
"said Meng, summing up his statement.
当然，所有关于居家办公的建议都在告诫我们：想专心工作，请先换掉睡衣。
Of course, all the advice about working from home is that if you want to concentrate on your work, change your pajamas first.
因为穿睡衣办公很容易模糊工作和生活的界限、不利于集中注意力，还时刻诱惑我们回到床上。
Working in pajamas blurs work-life boundaries, distracts concentration, and lures us back to bed.
但对大多数凡人来说，道理我们都懂，架不住睡衣实在舒服。
But to most mortals, the truth is we all understand that it is really comfortable to wear pajamas.
于是有人创造性地找到了解决方案：置办一套办公专用睡衣，既满足舒适度，又营造仪式感，两全其美。
So someone creatively found a solution: buy a set of office pyjamas to satisfy comfort and create a sense of ceremony, both beautiful.
拿睡衣当职场战袍的人显然大有人在。
People wearing pajamas are clearly in high demand.
在淘宝上，你甚至可以找到“商务睡衣”这样正儿八经的商品描述——完美匹配在家办公的需求。
On Taobao, you can even find an authentic description of a business pajamas that perfectly matches the need for a home office.
在被动宅家的这两个月里，睡衣的功能可谓得到了前所未有的开发。
In the two months of passive residence, the function of pajamas has been developed as never before.
我们穿着它睡觉，穿着它上班，穿着它出门。
We sleep in it, wear it to work and go out in it.
又当家居服又当职业装，重要性空前提高，一套睡衣也就显得不太够穿。
When the importance of domestic service and professional clothing, unprecedented increase in importance, a suit of pajamas is not enough to wear.
于是当服装行业在疫情影响下生意清淡时，睡衣几乎是一枝独秀地逆市上扬。
So when the clothing industry in the epidemic under the impact of light business, pajamas are almost exclusively upmarket.
有销量可证：淘宝上睡衣热卖一直持续到2月中旬[1]，拼多多2月19日公布的则数据显示，睡衣不但挤进了“宅家十大热销商品”榜单，而且比历史同期销量增加190%[1]。
Sales warrants: Taobao's pyjamas were hot at Taobao until mid-February and released February 19. Not only did pyjamas make up a list of the top 10 home-buyer items, but they were also up by 190% and # 91; 1 & # 93; & # 93; & # 39; by 190% and # 91; 1 & # 93; & # 39;
这一方面是因为人们终日在家，需求的确旺盛；另一方面，恐怕也算是一种报复性消费：想买的要么买不到（譬如口罩），要么用不上（譬如换季新衣），而买睡衣具备充分的必要性和合法性，可以稍稍纾解无处排遣的购物欲。
On the one hand, it is because people stay at home and demand is real; on the other hand, it is probably a form of vindictive consumption: people who want to buy either cannot buy (such as masks) or do not need them (such as changing clothes), and there is sufficient need and legitimacy to buy pajamas to ease the urge to shop.
当“外出不戴口罩呼吸自由”仍是奢望时，且让我们小小地体会一把“在家穿睡衣自由”。
When "going out and breathing freely without a mask" is still too much to hope for, let us take a small taste of "at home in pajamas freedom."
02.在家中，睡衣怎么穿都是自由。
) (At home, pajamas are free to wear whatever they wear.
但一旦穿睡衣出门，就会变成一个社会话题。
But once out in pajamas, it becomes a social issue.
一方认为，睡衣属于居家穿着，带有私密属性，公共场合穿睡衣虽然不犯法，但至少不太文明。
On one side, pajamas are worn at home, with intimate attributes, and wearing pajamas in public is not illegal, but at least uncivilized.
另一方则认为，睡衣包裹得严严实实，既不有碍观瞻，也非有伤风化，有哪里不文明？此话题还颇为敏感，搞不好就要上升到地域之争，陷入网络骂战的汪洋大海。
On the other hand, the pajamas are tightly packed, neither obscene nor indecent, and what is uncivilized? The topic is sensitive and may escalate into a regional battle and a sea of cybersquabbling.
其实话说回来，大多数地域之争本质上都是现实问题。
In fact, most of the regional disputes are realistic in nature.
冬季没有供暖的地方，谁也舍不得把好容易焐热乎的睡衣脱下去，再用宝贵的体温去焐热新换上来的带着潮气和寒气的衣服。
In winter, where there was no heating, no one was willing to take off the warm pyjamas, and use the precious temperature to warm the newly replaced clothes with moisture and cold.
南方冷系魔法攻击，谁试谁哆嗦。
Southern cold spell attack, who try who shiver.
很多情况下，穿睡衣出门实属无奈之举。
In many cases, wearing pajamas to go out is really helpless.
当大街上穿睡衣的人达到一定比例，似乎也就不以为怪。
When a certain percentage of people wear pajamas on the street, it doesn't seem surprising.
上海或许是关于“睡衣文化”最有发言权的城市之一。
Shanghai is perhaps one of the most vocal cities about the "pajamas culture."
早年间，上海街头巷尾穿睡衣的人乃是一道独特风景。
Early in life, people in pajamas in Shanghai's streets and alleys were a unique sight.
但从1993年《新民晚报》发文提出“睡衣、睡裙莫上街”起，对于这种风俗的挑战便愈演愈烈。
But the challenge to the custom has grown since the Novin Min Evening News sent a message in 1993 calling for "pajamas, pyjamas and sleepers not to go out on the street."
从2005年到2010年，沪上各大报纸关于“穿睡衣上街”的报道，多逾百篇。
From 2005 to 2010, there were more than a hundred more "pajamas on the streets" stories in Shanghai.
其中以2009年世博会前后为最甚：不光媒体呼吁，为了不让居民穿睡衣出门，上海还组织了志愿者做劝阻工作。
Among them, the Expo 2009 around the most: not only the media call, to prevent residents from wearing pajamas to go out, Shanghai also organized volunteers to do dissuasive work.
当时外国媒体也有不少报道，但他们的普遍反应却并不是嘲笑穿睡衣上街不文明，反倒觉得是一种独特的街头文化，甚至有点羡慕，也想“像上海人一样，穿着睡衣度过一天”[3]。
There was much foreign media coverage, but their general response was not to deride pajamas for being uncivilized, but rather as a distinct street culture, even a bit envious, and wanting to "spend the day in pajamas, as a Shanghainese," and & # 39; & # 39; 3 & # 93; & # 39; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
近些年，上海已经越来越少见穿睡衣出门的人，媒体也不再讨论相关议题。
In recent years, people in pajamas have become increasingly rare in Shanghai, and the media no longer discuss the issue.
“睡衣文化”因上海的弄堂生活而产生，当老旧居住房屋大量改造、消失时，也就失去了孕育它的土壤。
"Pajamas culture" because of the life in Shanghai, when the old residential buildings in a large number of transformation, disappearance, also lost the soil that gave birth to it.
许多习俗皆是如此。
This is true of many customs.
它无法被强制改变，只能顺其自然地兴起或消失。
It cannot be forced to change, only to rise or disappear as it should.
像安徽宿州那样用摄像头画面“曝光”穿睡衣出门的人，甚至附上其姓名、身份证号等信息的行为，只能让人感受到权力被滥用的愤怒和恐惧。
The practice of "exposing" people in pajamas, as in Suzhou, Anhui Province, and even including their names, identity numbers and other information, only creates feelings of anger and fear that power is being abused.

原图未打码“睡衣文化”也非只在中国才有。
The original picture does not mark "pajamas culture" is not unique to China.
人们是否拥有“出门穿睡衣自由”，乃是全世界都在争论的话题。
Whether people have the freedom to go out in their pajamas is a subject of debate all over the world.
2007年，阿联酋的一个酋长国颁布严格禁令，禁止政府工作人员穿睡衣上班。
In 2007, an emirate in the United Arab Emirates issued a strict ban on government workers from wearing pajamas to work.
2010年，英国一家乐购超市禁止穿睡衣的顾客进入。
In 2010, a Tesco supermarket in the UK banned pajamas-clad customers.
2012年，美国路易斯安纳州卡多教区颁布禁令，禁止公共场合穿睡衣。
In 2012, the parish of Cardo, Louisiana, issued a ban on wearing pajamas in public.
伊利诺斯州还有个神奇的法令：穿睡衣钓鱼违法。
Illinois also has a magical law: it's illegal to fish in pajamas.
之所以会有这些禁令，当然是因为已经有许多人在穿睡衣上班、逛街、钓鱼——相比之下，我国人民尚属克制，起码没几个人敢穿睡衣去上班。
These bans are, of course, due to the fact that many people already wear pajamas for work, shopping and fishing - in contrast to the restraint of our people, few of whom dare to wear pajamas to work.
当全世界都在讨论睡衣究竟能不能穿出门时，不甘寂寞的时尚界又有了新说法：穿睡衣出街才时髦。
As the world discusses whether pajamas can be worn out of doors, the lonesome fashion world has a new saying: it's fashionable to go out in pajamas.
当然，能当时髦潮品穿的睡衣，肯定不是我们熟悉的纯棉小碎花Hello Kitty款。
Of course, the pajamas that make for trendy fashion must not be the familiar cotton chintz Hello Kitty.
经过时尚界改造过的睡衣，大多材质精良、版型讲究，备受明星网红们追捧。
After the fashion industry has been transformed into pajamas, most of the material is well-made, version exquisite, the star network red hot pursuit.
有一阵子，演唱会上不穿个睡衣，你都不好意思说自己是个歌手。
For a while, you were too shy to say you were a singer without a nightgown.
但睡衣毕竟是睡衣，想穿出范儿来，对身高长相气场都有要求。
But pajamas are pajamas, trying to look stylish and demanding of height and style.
我等凡人，不建议轻易尝试。
I wait for mortals, do not recommend easy to try.
03.现代意义上的睡衣起源于19世纪，最初源头来自印度服装pyjama，是印度穆斯林穿着的一种宽松的长裤。
The pajamas in the modern sense originated in the 19th century and originated in the Indian costume pyjama, a loose-fitting pair of trousers worn by Muslims in India.
随着印度成为英国殖民地，这种服装传入欧洲，英文中的睡衣pajama一词，即由此演化而来。
As India became a British colony, the garment was introduced into Europe, and the term pajamas evolved from it.
睡衣在平民阶层的普遍流行还与第一次世界大战有关：当时夜晚常有空袭，人们必须穿上睡衣睡觉，才能在紧急奔逃避难时有衣物蔽体御寒[4]。
The popularity of pyjamas among the civilian population was also linked to the First World War: Air raids were common during the night, when people had to sleep in their night clothes to protect themselves from the cold and cold at the time of their emergency flight.
在文学和影视作品中，睡衣是出场率颇高的服装，但通常也仅限于功能性道具，并不承载太多意义。
In literature and film, pajamas are high-exit costumes, but they are usually limited to functional props and do not carry much meaning.
在为数不多的“睡衣题材”电影中，《穿条纹睡衣的男孩》大概是最出类拔萃的一部。
Of the few "pajamas" films, The Boy in Striped Pajamas is probably the best.
电影以二战为背景，主人公是八岁的小男孩布鲁诺。
Set in World War II, the film features an eight-year-old boy named Bruno.
他的父亲是纳粹军官，看管在波兰的集中营。
His father, a Nazi officer, guarded concentration camps in Poland.
幼小的布鲁诺并不知道，自己居住在杀人地狱奥斯维辛集中营旁。
Bruno, the youngest, did not know that he lived next to Auschwitz, a murderous hell.
偶尔看到穿着囚服的犹太人，他还以为他们穿的是条纹睡衣。
Occasionally he saw Jews in prison uniforms and thought they were wearing striped pajamas.
后来，布鲁诺认识了一个穿着条纹睡衣的男孩，两人成了朋友。
Later, Bruno met a boy in striped pajamas and they became friends.
为了帮朋友找失踪的爸爸，布鲁诺换上了“条纹睡衣”，偷偷爬进了集中营。
To help his friend find his missing father, Bruno put on his striped pajamas and crept into the camp.
结果，他也被当做集中营里的犹太孩子，和朋友一起被送进了毒气室，死于非命。
As a result, he was also treated as a Jewish child in a concentration camp and sent to the gas chamber with his friends, where he died.
这是一部看过一遍就不忍再回顾的致郁电影。
This is a dark film that can't be looked back on again.
囚服与条纹睡衣外表看上去如此相似，其间的隐喻不言而喻：在极端的环境下，普通人与受迫害的“罪人”之间，其实也只有一线之隔。
The metaphor behind the seeming resemblance of prison uniforms to striped pajamas is self-evident: in extreme circumstances, there is only a thin line between ordinary people and persecuted "sinners."
所幸，在绝大多数情况下，睡衣带给人的联想总是与温暖、舒适、亲密、放松联系在一起。
Fortunately, in most cases, pajamas are associated with warmth, comfort, closeness and relaxation.
睡衣成为居家办公“战袍”只是暂时的，它终究会慢慢退回到家居生活中。
Nightwear becomes a temporary 'war robe' in the home office, and it will eventually return to home life.
到那时，我们也许会偶尔怀念一天24小时穿着睡衣的日子——毕竟，穿睡衣省钱。
At that point, we might occasionally miss the 24-hour day in our pajamas -- after all, it saves money in pajamas.
