现实浇醒了英国人：不再无视戴口罩，如今华人买什么他们就买什么。
Reality has awakened Britons: they no longer ignore wearing masks, and they buy whatever they buy today.
文静。
Calm down.

意大利确诊数破千时，大部分英国人还在隔岸观火，有人甚至拿新冠病毒开玩笑。
When the diagnosis was made in Italy, most Britons were watching the fires, and some even joked about the new cap virus.
如今英国人聚集的社交网络上多的是祈祷上帝保佑的推文。
The social networks where Britons congregate today are filled with tweets praying for God.
有人调侃说，老外都跟在华人后面逛超市，华人买什么他们就买什么文 | 文静编辑 | 孙爱民谁也没想到英国会在全球抗疫中以这样的方式登上热搜。
Some joke that foreigners are following the Chinese at the supermarket, and that they buy whatever Chinese buy. No one expected Britain to have such a hot search in the global epidemic.
"群体免疫"的政策主张一提出，国内外都炸了锅。
& quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot;
我和先生定居英国多年，深知英国NHS（国家医疗系统）的脆弱，但还是没料到在这么强大的病毒疫情面前，有专家会给政府出这样的奇招。
Having lived in the UK for many years, my husband and I were well aware of the fragility of the NHS, but had no idea that an expert would give the government such a trick in the face of such a powerful virus.
近日中国很多朋友发来慰问，想知道在英国的华人同胞们到底在经历些什么？从我个人经历来看，这次疫情暴发前后，真有坐过山车一般的遭遇。
In recent days, many Chinese friends have sent solicitude to find out what the Chinese people in Britain are going through. From my personal experience, it was a roller coaster ride before and after the outbreak.
今年2月底，新冠疫情在意大利确诊数破千时，大部分英国人还在隔岸观火，有人甚至拿新冠病毒开玩笑，比如将coronavirus（新冠病毒）比成恰巧同音的一款啤酒corona，准备靠黑色幽默获得神奇的免疫力。
At the end of February, when the new crown was confirmed in Italy, most Britons were watching the fires, and some even joked about the crowning virus, such as comparing coronavirus to a coincidentally homologous beer corona, ready to gain magical immunity with black humor.
所幸，这家啤酒公司还没出来找大家损害其商誉的麻烦。
Luckily, the brewery company hasn't come out to trouble everyone to damage its reputation.
从我们在英国工作生活周边和网络上的一些言论，也可以一窥本国人对病毒的态度："上次你得流感是几年前？——我是20年前了。
Some of the things we say about working and living in the UK and on the Internet also give a glimpse of native attitudes to the virus: & quot; How many years ago was the last time you had the flu? - I was 20 years ago.
"——语气傲娇。
& quot; - proud of its tone.
"这个病毒只有老年人死亡率高，年轻人得了也没事。
The virus has a high death rate only among the elderly, and young people are fine.
"——你是专家吗？"我们英国人可是经历过两次世界大战都活下来的人。
A: Are you an expert? We British people have survived two world wars.
"——......相比英国人的普遍冷静，部分在英国的华人群体则走向另一个极端。
Compared with the general coolness of the British, parts of the British Chinese population have gone to the other extreme.
毕竟从2019年12月底到今年2月份，中国的艰苦抗疫轰轰烈烈，海外华人们在社交媒体看到太多生离死别，和国内家人视频大家都语气严肃，警告我们待在家里，早日囤货。
After all, from the end of December 2019 to February this year, China's hard-fought epidemic has been so intense that overseas Chinese have seen too much life and death on social media, and domestic family video everyone is serious, warning us to stay at home and stock up early.
在这样的警觉下，很多华人一看到意大利的确诊数，就早早买了口罩。
Under such vigilance, many Chinese buy masks as soon as they see the number of confirmed cases in Italy.
有在英国的香港朋友2月底就在亚马逊商城买了3箱口罩，寄回国一半，自己留一半。
A Hong Kong friend in the UK bought three boxes of masks at the Amazon Mall in late February, sent them half way home, and kept half of them.
当时还是买2送1，价格大概6英镑一包，折合人民币不到50元，我们还觉得有点夸张了。
We thought it was a bit of an exaggeration to buy 2 for 1 at a price of about 6 pounds a bag, or less than 50 yuan.
谁知大概一周多的时间，亚马逊就开启限购，需要有牙医或特殊医疗用途证明才能买到，直到3月中旬全部下架。
For more than a week, Amazon began to limit purchases, requiring a dentist's or special medical certificate to buy them until mid-March, when they were all off shelves.
英国确诊病例维持个位数时，英国首相鲍里斯·约翰逊主要宣传多洗手，打喷嚏遮挡嘴，每次洗手唱两遍"生日快乐歌"，并没有提到口罩和其他措施，也许是为了不引起公众恐慌。
When the number of confirmed cases in the UK remained in single digits, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson promoted frequent hand-washing, sneezing and twice-yearly hand-washing; Happy Birthday Song & quot; and made no mention of masks and other measures, perhaps to avoid public alarm.
在相当长一段时间里，面对疫情蔓延，不少英国人继续喝着啤酒唱着歌，要开party一样。
For a long time, in the face of the spread of the epidemic, many British people continued to drink beer and sing songs, like a party.
华人社区则忧心忡忡，觉得是时候购买洗手液等消毒用品了。
The Chinese community is worried that it is time to buy hand sanitizers.
疫情急速蔓延很快，英国人就发现，病毒和疫情的蔓延速度超出了所有人的预期。
As the epidemic spread rapidly, the British found that the virus and the epidemic were spreading faster than anyone had expected.
进入3月短短数天，英国的确诊数量飙升，3月初从个位数突破50人。
In just a few days into March, the number of confirmed cases surged in the UK, surging from single digits to more than 50 in early March.
英国政府终于坐不住了，3月3日公布了行动计划，分四个阶段：控制，拖延，研究，缓解。
Finally, the British government released its action plan on March 3 in four stages: control, delay, research, and mitigation.
然而，不到一周就宣布控制失败，直接进入拖延阶段！感觉第一阶段完全没有存在的必要。
Less than a week later, however, the control was declared a failure, and the first stage was felt to be completely unnecessary.
病毒之前主要集中在伦敦，后来离我们所在的小城越来越近，距我家车程5分钟的地区出现了确诊病例，是一位去过意大利的小学教师。
The virus, which used to be concentrated in London, was a primary school teacher who had been to Italy as we got closer and closer to our town, five minutes from my home.
附近唯一一所大医院出现了一例死亡病例（70岁左右）。
There was one fatality (around 70 years of age) at the only major hospital in the vicinity.
伦敦作为金融中心，感染数字每天都在飙升，占全英国确诊数量一半左右。
London, as a financial centre, has seen its infection figures soar every day, accounting for about half of all UK diagnoses.
我们开始担心孩子，计划让娃回家不去幼儿园了。
We began to worry about our children, planning to let Eva go home from kindergarten.
但学校的老师以及其他英国家长依然"迷之淡定"，出入如常。
But school teachers and other British parents have been at Rite's service.
我和同事讨论，为什么英国人不爱戴口罩，他说因为他们从小没见过口罩，平时诊所连医生护士都不戴口罩，觉得只有生病才需要戴。
I discussed with colleagues why British people do not love masks. He said that because they had never seen a mask when they were young, doctors and nurses did not wear them and felt they needed them only when they were sick.
但华人不管这些，纷纷顶着巨大的压力戴起了口罩，常常被路人以复杂目光注视，每次去超市都要给自己做好心理建设：怕死不可笑，死了才可笑。
But despite all this, the Chinese wear masks under enormous pressure and are often looked at by passers-by with complex eyes. Every time they go to the supermarket, they have to do a good job of psychological construction: fear of death can not laugh, death is laughable.
当时国内流传一个视频，意大利议员在国会戴口罩被嘲笑随后暴怒，他也说出了我们的心声："如果你们聪明，就应该也赶快戴上！"期间，我家3岁的娃摔破头还去了一次急诊，医生、护士和急诊室的病人都没有戴口罩，还和往常一样谈笑风生，其中有一位护士疯狂咳嗽，也没人躲闪。
A video circulating in the country, where Italian lawmakers were ridiculed for wearing a mask before becoming angry, also says: & quot; If you were smart, you should have worn it! & # 160; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
只有我和先生轮流带着孩子在通风处站着，远离所有人。
Only my husband and I took turns standing in the air with our children, far away from everyone.
说实话，这种反差真是我距离"文化冲击"这个词最近的一次。
To tell the truth, this is the closest I've ever had to the word & quot; culture shock & quot;
我和先生觉得是时候囤货了，本以为算行动快的，没想到伦敦中国超市里的米面已经所剩不多并迅速涨价。
My husband and I think it is time to hoard goods, originally thought calculate fast action, did not expect the rice noodles in London Chinese supermarket already have few and rapid price increases.
华人群里有人甚至购买冰柜囤货。
Some Chinese even buy freezers to stock up.
朋友婆婆是英国人，不太理解她的囤货行为，直到一周后超市连洗手液都买不到了，英国婆婆开始着急，跑到一个很远的超市买回来跟她说，"我去超市拿走了货架上最后三瓶洗手液，心里还有点愧疚。
My friend's mother-in-law, who is British, didn't understand her hoarding until a week later when the liquid soap was unavailable, the British mother-in-law rushed to a distant supermarket to buy it and say, "I went to the supermarket and took the last three bottles of liquid soap off the shelf.
"最好笑的是，不知哪里来的传言，说英国的厕纸主要是中国生产的，而且和口罩是一种原料，英国人很快就没有厕纸供给了，于是大家开始疯狂囤厕纸——遭到全球群嘲。
& quot; & quot; & quot; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
争议"群体免疫"论3月13日，英国政府首席科学官发表了提出群体免疫概念的著名讲话，鲍里斯还在此基础上加上了一句"我们将失去挚爱亲朋"。
AT & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45
——舆论瞬间发酵，WHO以及英国医学专家都对这种说法进行了抨击，说英国是在拿人命冒险。
World Health Organisation and British medical experts have attacked the idea, saying Britain is risking human life.
在英国的华人更不淡定了。
The Chinese in Britain are even less sanguine.
直接效果就是各大航空公司的机票价格忽然哄抬，一些人甚至讨论要包机回国避难。
The immediate effect was that airline tickets were suddenly inflated, and some even discussed chartering flights to take refuge in the country.
国内的亲人也劝我们赶快回去。
The family at home also advised us to go back quickly.
（3月19日携程从伦敦飞北京经济舱的单程机票价格，飞行时间都超过30小时）演讲如同一瓢冷水，终于浇醒一部分英国人，最直接的改变是：越来越多英国人也开始往超市冲；需要配送服务的很多商家开始推行零接触送货（放下就走，无肢体接触）。
(One-way air fares from London to Beijing on March 19th, flying more than 30 hours) The speech was like a cold shower that finally watered for some Britons. The most immediate change: More and more Britons are starting to rush to supermarkets; many businesses requiring distribution services are pushing for zero-touch delivery (drop-down, no-body contact).
零售商、幼儿园、活动中心等纷纷致信消费者，称自己的店铺、工作环境等都经过了严格消毒，可以最大程度保证安全，隔绝病毒。
Retailers, kindergartens, activity centers and so on have written to consumers, saying their shops, work environment, etc. have been strictly disinfected, to ensure maximum safety, isolation of the virus.
一些流言开始在华人圈肆虐，有人说包机是骗局，警告大家不要上当，也有说政府隐瞒消息了，真实死亡案例比公布的要多，有开始倒卖中药的，还有很多华人被种族歧视——有华人店铺收到威胁信，用恶毒肮脏的语气攻击中国人；中国留学生被外国孩子聚众殴打……——这些坏消息让不少在英国的华人胆战心惊。
Some say charter flights are scams, some warn people not to be fooled, some say the government is withholding information, some are beginning to resell Chinese medicine, many are racist - some Chinese shops receive threatening letters and attack the Chinese in a vicious and dirty tone; Chinese students are being beaten by foreign students... - bad news is frightening to many Chinese in the UK.
一百八十度转弯就在群情激愤全球声讨英国政府时，3月16日，鲍里斯话锋一转，在最新疫情公告中语气严肃通知70岁以上老年人在家自我隔离，其他人则保持社交距离。
On March 16, Boris took a swipe at the idea of a global outcry against the British government. In his latest outbreak announcement, Boris solemnly told people over the age of 70 to isolate themselves at home, while others kept their distance.
很多人猜测鲍里斯是"欲擒故纵"，假装不作为，以激发民众的紧张情绪。
Many speculate that Boris was & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; to arouse public tension.
真假不得而知，但效果还挺明显，英国人开始重视防疫，跟着囤积各种物品，大大小小的超市真的空了。
True or false, but the effect is quite obvious, the British began to pay attention to epidemic prevention, followed by hoarding a variety of goods, large and small supermarkets are really empty.
但我觉得鲍里斯并不是在虚张声势，因为NHS常年缺乏床位、资源，全英格兰只有8个实验室可以做核酸检测，这是大家都知道的事实，英国目前当务之急就是减缓增长曲线，不让大量重症导致NHS崩溃。
But I don't think Boris is bluffing, because the NHS has a chronic shortage of beds and resources, and only eight laboratories in England can be tested for nucleic acids.
据流出报告显示，政府最终预测这次疫情会导致26万人死亡。
According to the outflow report, the government finally predicted that the epidemic would cause 260,000 deaths.
他无情的讲话可能只是早早摊牌而已。
His heartless remarks may be just an early showdown.
以英国的非紧急医疗求助电话111为例。
Take, for example, Britain's non-emergency medical helpline.
平时该电话接通大概需要20分钟左右，急救人员或护士会通过电话回答一些有关基础病的问题，多数就是个心理安慰，情况严重的会建议你去看社区医生。
It usually takes about 20 minutes for the call to go through. First aid workers or nurses will answer some basic questions by phone, most of them for psychological comfort. In serious cases, you may be advised to see a community doctor.
疫情爆发以来，政府不让疑似患者自行去医院，建议先打电话给111，由于流量过大，人手不够，打通基本要30分钟到1小时，很多人都放弃了。
Since the outbreak, the government has not allowed suspected patients to go to hospitals on their own. It is recommended to call 111. Due to heavy traffic and lack of manpower, it will take 30 minutes to an hour to reach the hospital.
3月16日后，英国政府公布了轻症患者出现症状自行隔离在家14天，医院只有能力收治重症。
After March 16, the British government announced that patients with mild symptoms of self-isolation at home for 14 days, the hospital only has the capacity to treat serious illness.
111电话的提示音也变了，内容令人心凉："如果你是轻症患者，不必告诉我们，请自行在家隔离。
The phone's tone has changed, too: & # 160; & quot; & # 45; & # 45; & quot; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45
如果你需要隔离建议，自行在官网查找，电话不会提供。
If you need isolation advice, look it up on the official website, the phone will not be available.
除非你症状严重，呼吸困难，日常生活无法继续，否则你不需要和我们通话。
You don't need to talk to us unless you have severe symptoms, breathing difficulties and no way to continue your daily life.
"3月17日，我儿子突然发烧38度，伴随咳嗽，我怀疑是普通感冒，但也隐隐担心。
My son had a sudden fever of 38 degrees on March 17, accompanied by a cough that I suspected was common, but dimly worried.
我们打给111确认，结果对方说医院和急诊目前都不收治轻症，也不做测试，根据我们的情况，只让孩子在家隔离。
We called 111 to confirm, the other side said that hospitals and emergency medical care do not currently accept light cases, nor do tests, according to our situation, only let the children isolation at home.
我们也不敢冒险去医院，于是只能在家，还好儿子很快退烧了。
We did not dare to risk going to the hospital, so we had to stay at home, but my son soon had a fever.
朋友中不止我们一家有类似情况，瞬间感受到什么叫无助和靠自己。
More than one of our friends have a similar situation, momentarily feel what is called helplessness and self-reliance.
以英国的医疗条件，也许这场持久站真的只能凭借自身免疫力。
Given Britain's health-care conditions, perhaps this durable stand can only rely on its own immunity.
学校纷纷关闭3月18日，意大利单日死亡创下新高475例，英国总的死亡人数达到104人。
Schools were closed March 18, Italy hit a new high of 475 a day, bringing the total death toll in Britain to 104.
在大家（主要是华人）的期盼下，在意大利、法国、西班牙早已采取关闭措施后，在英国提出群体免疫不到一周后，鲍里斯终于宣布英格兰关闭所有学校，建议私校和幼儿园也关闭，只留下一部分人力照顾医护人员、警察、社工、送货司机等关键岗位人员的子女，并继续提供很多家庭非常需要的学校免费午餐。
After a week of closure in Italy, France, and Spain, and less than a week after the UK proposed mass immunization, Boris finally announced that all schools in England would be closed, and private schools and kindergartens would be closed, leaving only some manpower to care for children in key positions such as health care workers, police, social workers, delivery drivers and many much-needed free school lunches.
建议70岁以上老人和孙辈分开隔离。
It is recommended that older persons over 70 be separated from their grandchildren.
鞋子终于落了地。
Finally the shoes fell to the ground.
英国华人们心也稍微安稳了一点，朋友圈有人调侃说，老外现在都跟在华人后面逛超市，华人买什么他们就买什么。
People in Britain are a little more at ease, with some in the circle of friends quoting that foreigners are now following the Chinese in their shopping malls and buying whatever they buy.
（全英12家超市近日联名发信，称会尽全力确保日常货品供应）很多本地雇主都出台应急预案，包括轮岗，部分甚至所有员工在家工作等措施，相信离全面回家办公，伦敦封城也不远了。
(A joint letter from 12 supermarkets across the UK said it would do its utmost to ensure the daily supply of goods) Many local employers have contingency plans in place, ranging from job rotation to home-based work for some or all employees, and believe the closure of London is not far away.
身边很多人在网上注册了志愿者，给70岁以上的隔离在家的独居老人送日常物资等。
Many people around have registered as volunteers online, giving daily supplies to isolated old people over the age of 70 who live alone.
部分超市和药房开放了"老年人专门购物时段"，确保老人日常生活正常进行。
Some supermarkets and pharmacies have opened up & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
（来自3月17日，YouGov针对2000多名英国人做的调研，依然有41%的人不准备待在家里）关闭学校能否实现鲍里斯说的放缓增长速度的目的？英国迟缓反应是否已经让大家错过了最佳机会？没人知道答案。
(According to a YouGov survey of more than 2,000 Britons on March 17, 41% are still not prepared to stay at home.) Will closing schools achieve Boris' stated goal of slowing growth?
截稿前，我身边的英国人表面看上去依然镇静，不知道这种淡定还能坚持多久。
Before the cut-off, the Englishmen around me looked calm on the surface, not knowing how long the calmness would last.
一个重要变化是，英国网络社交媒体上近日已很少有关于新冠病毒和疫情的黑色幽默了，取而代之的是纷纷祈祷上帝保佑的推文。
One important change is that there has been little black humor about the new crown virus and epidemic on social media in the UK these days, replaced by prayers for God's tweets.
