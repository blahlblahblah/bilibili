几家殡葬服务公司告诉南方人物周刊，大约在1月中旬，他们已经停止提供殡葬服务。
Several funeral services told the Southern Charity Weekly that they had stopped providing funeral services around mid-January.
当时殡仪馆已经停止悼念活动，以避免扩大交叉传染的风险武汉民政局于近日宣布，死亡原因为新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎（包括疑似）的遗体火化不需缴纳费用，这项安排从26日起实行，而在26日前缴纳过费用的家属，可办理退费本文首发于南方人物周刊文|本刊记者 杨楠 实习记者 聂阳欣 何沛芸编辑|周建平蒯乐昊全文约3501字，细读大约需要8分钟资料图限行延长处理时间若是十天前，去世于武汉市汉兴阳光老年养护中心养老院的老人，会由殡仪馆通知家属和临近的汉口殡仪馆。
Wuhan Civil Affairs Bureau announced recently that no fee would be charged for cremation of the remains of pneumonia (including suspected) infected with the new coronavirus. Family members who have paid before 26 days may apply for a refund.
在两小时内，由家属办理好死亡证明等手续，并由汉口殡仪馆接走。
Within two hours, the family processed the death certificate and other procedures, and Hankou funeral parlour to take away.
而在因疫情”封城“的武汉，处理后事的时间可能会延长几倍。
In Wuhan, where the outbreak "closed" the city, the processing time could be several times longer.
1月28日，一位在这家养老院去世的老人，在16个小时后才等来了殡仪馆的车辆。
On January 28, an elderly man who died in the nursing home waited 16 hours for the funeral parlour to arrive.
在这16个小时里，养老院打了三次市长热线，得知汉口殡仪馆目前只接收疑似或确诊新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎的患者；逝者家属用了八个小时才赶到养老院——市内机动车限行了，他们需要向所在社区申请使用车辆方能出行。
During the 16 hours, the nursing home called the Mayor's Hotline three times and learned that the Hankou mortuary currently only receives patients with pneumonia suspected or confirmed to be infected with the new coronavirus. It took eight hours for the families of the deceased to reach the nursing home, which is restricted to vehicles in the city.
等待家属办理完死亡证明后，武昌殡仪馆同意前来接收遗体。
Waiting for the family to complete the death certificate, Wuchang mortuary agreed to come to receive the body.
他们已经排在了武昌殡仪馆接送序列的前十位，至少还需要等待四个小时。
They were already in the top 10 of the funeral parlour in Wuchang, and would have to wait at least four hours.
武昌殡仪馆的工作人员告诉南方人物周刊，他们目前要同时负责汉口和武昌的殡葬服务，自27日起，民政局增配了车辆及人力，增至白天六辆工作车、晚间四辆，但他们的接运压力仍然非常大。
Staff at Wuchang Funeral Home told the Southern People's Weekend that they were now responsible for the funeral services in Hankou and Wuchang. Since 27, the Civil Affairs Bureau has increased the number of vehicles and manpower to six by day and four by night, but the pressure on their transportation is still very high.
从武昌殡仪馆往返汉口的接运时间被拉长到两小时一趟，通过审核的申请，需要等待四至八小时才能够被接运。
From Wuchang funeral parlour to Hankou transport time was lengthened to two hours, approved applications, need to wait four to eight hours to be able to be transported.
等了七个小时，武昌殡仪馆接走了逝者。
After seven hours of waiting, Wuchang funeral parlour picked up the dead.
武汉民政局规定，疫情期间各殡仪馆暂停告别仪式，仅允许一名家属进入殡仪馆办理业务，并需佩戴口罩，进门登记，测量体温，洗手消毒。
Wuhan Civil Affairs Bureau stipulated that during the outbreak of the funeral homes were suspended, only one family member was allowed to enter the funeral parlour business, wearing masks, entering the door to register, temperature measurement, hand-washing disinfection.
等家属登记完信息，遗体将会被火化，然后寄存，等疫情结束通知家属前来领取。
After the family registers the information, the body will be cremated and stored until the family is notified of the end of the outbreak.
送走了逝者，安抚好院内其他的老人。
Take away the dead and placate the other elderly people in the hospital.
养老院的吴院长仍然心存隐忧：她并不能百分百确认院内老人们的健康状况。
The director of the nursing home, Wu, is still worried: she can't confirm the well-being of the elderly.
虽然逝者生前常年患有肺慢阻，养老院内医护人员认为其是自然离世。
Although the deceased suffered from chronic pulmonary retardation, nursing home staff believe that it is natural death.
但逝者临终前出现了发热，养老院内亦存在其他几位发热的病人。
But before the death of the deceased appeared fever, there were several other patients in the nursing home febrile.
在这个有着一百多位身体状况不佳老人的养老院，社区医院暂时无力对发热病人进行检测，也就无法判断他们是否感染新型冠状病毒。
At the nursing home, which has more than 100 elderly patients in poor health, the community hospital is temporarily unable to test the febrile patients to see if they are infected with the new coronavirus.
吴院长自己也是半个老人了。
President Wu himself is half an old man.
她不太上网，年轻人通过网络能够轻易获得的消息，她仍然习惯于打电话询问。
She doesn't use the Internet much. Young people have easy access to it. She is still used to making phone calls.
武汉限制机动车出行后，她看不明白社区的文件，费了力气才弄清如何向社区申请使用车辆。
Wuhan restrictions on motor vehicle travel, she did not understand the community documents, it took a lot of effort to find out how to apply to the community to use the vehicles.
养老院内出现第一例发热后，她即向社区申请用车带院内老人去看病。
After the first fever in the nursing home, she applied to the community for a car to take the elderly to the hospital.
三天后，社区才回电可以用车，却碰上院内春节期间人手不够，她无法撇下其他老人离开。
Three days later, the community was able to call back the car, but ran into a shortage of staff during the Spring Festival, she could not leave the other elderly.
吴院长联系家属，家属同样说：限行，出不来。
President Wu contact his family, the family also said: restrictions on travel, can not get out.
她仍在等待市政热线给她的留言回复：希望特殊时期政府能加强对养老院的照顾。
She is still waiting for a message from the municipal hotline saying she hopes the government will step up care for the elderly in special times.
1月29日，武汉，社区物业给居民楼道场所进行消毒 图 / 中新社限定殡仪馆接收患者遗体1月26日早上七点，朱华给汉口殡仪馆打了电话。
On January 29, Wuhan, community property to the residential building site disinfection map / China News Agency limited the funeral home to receive the body of the patient at 7 a.m. January 26, Zhu Hua to Hankou mortuary called.
她的父亲在家中离世，之前被诊断为疑似新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎。
Her father died at home after being diagnosed with pneumonia suspected to be a new coronavirus infection.
当她与母亲在社区办理完死亡证明后，殡仪馆又告诉她，必须在家中消毒完，自行包裹好遗体，工作人员才能上门。
When she and her mother had completed the death certificate in the community, the funeral home told her that she had to disinfect her home and wrap her body so that the staff could come to the door.
在这之后的十个小时，她找社区，社区层层反映，“连区长都找了，向市指挥部也协调了”： 希望没有确诊新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎的家庭，也能够得到社区消毒。
Ten hours later, she sought the community, and the community responded, "Even the mayor has sought and coordinated with the city headquarters": families wishing not to be diagnosed with the new coronavirus infection would also be able to be disinfected in the community.
社区医院只有一位消毒人员，这意味着家属必须协助完成消毒工作。
There is only one disinfectant in the community hospital, which means that the family must assist with the disinfection.
下午六点，朱华和母亲戴上口罩和普通的眼镜，去消毒，然后用三层床单裹上父亲的遗体，等待汉口殡仪馆来车。
At 6 p. m., Zhu Hua and his mother put on masks and ordinary glasses to disinfect them. Then they wrapped their father's body in three sheets and waited for the Hankou mortuary to come.
在疫情防控的关键时期，社区的动员能力和工作强度都被置于超负荷的运转中。
During the critical period of epidemic prevention and control, the ability of the community to mobilize and the intensity of its work are put into overloaded operation.
在武昌宝安社区，七个工作人员需要应对3885户住户的疫情排查、卫生清洁和用车需求，也就是平均每人需要应对500多个家庭。
In the Wuchang Baoan community, seven workers have to cope with the epidemic situation of 3,885 households, sanitation and vehicle needs, or an average of more than 500 families per person.
每天，工作人员的值班记录本都有四十条左右的记录。
On a daily basis, the staff members' duty log books contain about 40 entries.
一位工作人员告诉南方人物周刊，“每天安排（社区车）送菜都搞不完，更别说医生来协助消毒了。
"There's not a whole day of arrangements [for a community car] to deliver food, let alone a doctor to help disinfect it," a staff member told Southern Personality Weekly.
”1月26日，武汉禁行机动车，政府调配车辆。
On January 26, Wuhan banned motor vehicles and the government deployed vehicles.
在一个社区里，平均每五百户可以分到一辆用车，用车需求庞杂而琐碎：疑似病例申请用车去检查；尿毒症患者申请用车去透析，孤寡老人需要工作人员用车买水送菜……一位居民希望社区给住院中的病人送饭，“我们便民车没有防护服，不具备上医院的条件。
In a community where an average of 500 families are given a car, the demand for cars is complex and trivial: suspicious cases apply for a car test; uremia patients apply for car dialysis; widowed elderly people need to be driven by staff to buy water and food... One resident wants the community to deliver food to hospitalized patients.
只能和家属说，医院有医生照看，你不用去。
Just talk to your family. The hospital has a doctor. You don't have to go.
”一位工作人员说。
"said one of the staff.
朱华家消毒完成半小时后，汉口殡仪馆的车来了。
Half an hour after the disinfection of the Chu Hua's home, the Hankou funeral parlour car arrived.
工作人员身着防护服，戴着口罩、防护镜和手套，避免和家属过多接触。
Staff wear protective clothing, masks, goggles and gloves to avoid excessive contact with their families.
这是朱华同父亲告别的最后一面，她不被允许跟车。
This is the last time Zhu Hua says goodbye to her father. She is not allowed to follow the car.
相关证件需以电子版的形式发给殡仪馆，远程完成后续手续。
Relevant documents should be sent to the funeral home in electronic form to complete the follow-up formalities remotely.
疫情结束后，她可以去领取父亲的骨灰。
After the outbreak is over, she can collect her father's ashes.
武汉市民政局的工作人员告诉南方人物周刊，大约从1月20日开始，就限定仅有汉口殡仪馆接收新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎患者遗体。
Officials at Wuhan Civil Affairs Bureau told the Southern Personalities Weekly that only the Hankou mortuary was allowed to receive the remains of pneumonia patients infected with the new coronavirus from about January 20.
汉口殡仪馆的车辆从9辆增至16辆，也为工作人员配备了防护措施，但接运压力仍然不小。
The Hankou mortuary increased its vehicle fleet from 9 to 16 vehicles and was also equipped with protective measures for the staff, but the pressure to transport the vehicles was still considerable.
昨日凌晨十二点半，汉口殡仪馆仍有二十左右的排号，在等待他们前去。
At half past twelve yesterday morning, the Hankou mortuary still had about twenty platoons waiting for them to go.
工作人员在处理遗体  图 /IC photo情况正在好转一些迹象显示，殡仪馆或许提早知晓疫情的危险。
Staff handling the remains chart / IC photo is improving There are some signs that the mortuary may have been aware of the danger of the outbreak earlier.
几家殡葬服务公司告诉南方人物周刊，大约在1月中旬，他们已经停止提供殡葬服务。
Several funeral services told the Southern Charity Weekly that they had stopped providing funeral services around mid-January.
当时殡仪馆已经停止悼念活动，以避免扩大交叉传染的风险。
The funeral parlour had stopped mourning to avoid the risk of spreading cross-infection.
“封城”前允许少量亲属在大厅对着骨灰盒进行简单的告别，“封城”后仅允许一位家属进入殡仪馆。
A small number of relatives were allowed to bid a simple farewell to the urn in front of the city, and only one family member was allowed to enter the funeral home after the closure.
几位家属和殡葬服务公司的工作人员告诉南方人物周刊，早在1月18日，他们就注意到，汉口殡仪馆的工作人员身着全套防护，去医院接诊断为“重症肺炎”的患者遗体。
Several family members and mortuary workers told Southern Personalities Weekly that as early as 18 January, they had noticed that the staff of the Hankou funeral home had gone to the hospital to receive the remains of patients diagnosed with "severe pneumonia," wearing full protective clothing.
在接送完后，殡仪馆工作人员马上扔掉手套和口罩。
After the delivery, the undertaker's staff immediately threw away the gloves and masks.
在增派车辆没有到位前，汉口殡仪馆面临的压力比较大，现在事态正在好转。
Before the deployment of additional vehicles, Hankou mortuary faced more pressure, and things are now improving.
武汉大学人民医院急诊科的一名医护人员告诉南方人物周刊，现在的流程是：新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎患者去世后，医生当场开具死亡证明，然后由家属联系殡仪馆处理后事，这个过程目前并不需要很长时间。
A medical staff member of the emergency department of Wuhan University's People's Hospital told the Southern Personality Weekly that the current procedure is that after the death of a patient with coronavirus-infected pneumonia, the doctor issues a death certificate on the spot and the family contacts the funeral home to handle the case, a process that does not take long.
一度有殡葬公司在疫情期间提高收费。
There were funeral companies that raised fees during the outbreak.
据《新京报》1月27日报道，一位因肺部感染去世的死者家属，因汉口殡仪馆称没有车辆要送，花了12000多元找来一家殡葬服务公司完成运送和火化。
A family member of the deceased who died of a lung infection spent more than 12,000 yuan to find a funeral service to transport and cremate because the Hankou funeral home said it had no vehicles to deliver.
涉事殡葬服务公司解释说，提高了两倍多的收费，是因为自己也害怕被感染，所以起步价都在一万以上。
The funeral service explained that it had more than doubled its fees because it was afraid of getting infected, so it started at more than 10, 000.
武汉民政局表示，将严打加价运送遗体者。
Wuhan Civil Affairs Bureau said it would crack down on those who ship the bodies at inflated prices.
多家殡葬服务公司均向南方人物周刊表示，高价收费曝光后，现在不敢接活了，“事帮你办了，回头你就去举报怎么办？”武汉民政局于近日宣布，死亡原因为新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎（包括疑似）的遗体火化不需缴纳费用，这项安排从26日起实行，而在26日前缴纳过费用的家属，可办理退费。
Wuhan Civil Affairs Bureau announced recently that the cremation of the remains of pneumonia (including suspected) due to new coronavirus infection would not be subject to the payment of a fee, while families who had paid the fee before the 26th day would be entitled to a refund, the bureau said recently.
