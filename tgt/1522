The project director Liu Junjun looked at his watch, the next morning to complete the first draft of the "big test" test, a total of only 582 minutes.
这是一场与时间的赛跑，一刻也缓不得、一刻也松懈不得。

每个人心里都绷着一根弦，憋着一股劲，生怕设计的细节还有疏漏，生怕“答题”交卷的时间愈发临近，但他们完全挤不出看表的间隙。
Everyone felt a string in their hearts, feeling like they were suffocating over the details of the design for fear that the time would come when the answers would be handed in, but they would not be able to squeeze in the space between their watches.

但救护生命的方舟建设刻不容缓，准时交卷只是与病毒赛跑中途的胜利。

与疫情搏斗，确保医院早日建成，依然需要他们一秒都不能松懈。

为便于图纸指导施工，本部设计团队通过视频会议系统，全天候以网络值班的方式远程提供咨询及建议，对施工现场问题随时反馈、随时研究、随时修改设计，同时安排武汉分公司两位专业技术人员，现场24小时不间断提供施工配合服务。

走在清晨空无一人的街道上，心却很热乎，能为抗击疫情做出贡献，值得！为保证技术人员现场的生命健康和安全，上海市政总院根据疫情防护办法成立后勤保障组，要求务必做到：施工配合采取轮班倒机制，领导实时关注和严格控制每位员工的作息时间以免造成过免疫力降低；在外必须配带护目镜、防护口罩、防护手套，进入办公室或回家立刻用消毒液洗手，并对外衣进行喷淋消杀，将用过的一次性防护用品消毒密封处理后投入专用垃圾收集箱，避免二次污染；针对现场医护资源紧缺的情况，及时调配口罩、护目镜等资源送达施工配合人员手中。
