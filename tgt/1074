”吉吉说，澳洲学校主动联系了他，提出了“网课”等解决方案。

网课对于部分专业的学生来说，可以节约时间、跟紧学习节奏，不失为一个好建议。

Asked if he had considered returning to Australia earlier, Gigi said: "As a Hubei people, self-isolation for at least 14 days, is my due awareness and responsibility.
1月时还未满隔离时间，如果提前返澳，不仅给自身带来感染风险，而且倘若因此落得留学生‘带病出国’的骂名，还会对中国留学生的形象造成影响，得不偿失。
January has not yet been separated from the time, if returned to Australia early, not only to their own risk of infection, but also if the international students' "bring sickness abroad" reputation, will also have an impact on the image of Chinese students, lost.
