英国疫情统计（图片来源：Wind）据央视新闻援引英国媒体消息，因英国疫情紧迫，英国女王伊丽莎白二世近日已经暂时迁离白金汉宫，在伦敦以外的温莎城堡躲避。
Queen Elizabeth II has moved out of Buckingham Palace to take refuge outside London at Windsor Castle in the face of the urgency of the British epidemic, the CCTV news quoted British media as saying.
皇室发言人表示，位于伦敦市中心的白金汉宫有500名工作人员，比起其他皇家领地，这里的潜在危险更大。
A royal spokesman said Buckingham Palace, in central London, has 500 workers and is potentially more dangerous than other Crown Dependencies.
如果英国情况进一步恶化，即将94岁的伊丽莎白二世女王和98岁的菲利普亲王将被安排到距离伦敦200公里的桑德林汉姆宫躲避。
Queen Elizabeth II, 94, and Prince Philip, 98, will be sent to Sandringham Palace, 200 kilometres from London, if the situation deteriorates further.
而在民间，部分物资紧缺的现象已经出现。
But in the folk, the partial material shortage phenomenon has appeared.
据央视新闻，英国民众先是抢购卫生纸和洗手液，这些商品基本是每天上货后就会迅速被人买走，而在面包货架上，几乎什么都买不到了。
People are snapping up toilet paper and hand sanitizers, which can be quickly bought on a daily basis but are practically non-existent on the shelves, CCTV said.
除此之外，被抢购一空的食品还包括鸡蛋、牛奶、米、面、罐头、饼干和冷冻蔬菜，这些都是非常便于储存的食品。
In addition, there are eggs, milk, rice, pasta, cans, biscuits and frozen vegetables, all of which are easy to store.

在“群体免疫”引发一片哗然之后，英国卫生大臣给出了新的解释。
In the wake of the outcry over "mass immunization," the British Health Secretary offered a new explanation.
卫生大臣：“群体免疫”不是目标或政策3月12日，英国首相鲍里斯·约翰逊在新闻发布会上表示，“新冠疫情是这一代人遇到的最严重的公共健康危机。
"The new crown is the worst public health crisis of our generation," British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said at a news conference on Monday.
坦白地说，更多家庭将有亲人夭折。
Frankly, many more families will die.
”当天，鲍里斯在新闻发布会上正式宣布英国进入抗疫第二阶段——“拖延”阶段（Delay）。
"Boris announced at a news conference that Britain had entered the second phase of its fight against the disease, the Delay.
简单来说，英国的防疫的策略是"不严防死守，容忍疫情缓慢进展，期待大部分人在隐匿性感染后无症状或仅有轻微症状，从而在人群中获得普遍免疫，以控制疫情"，也就是通过群体免疫力（Herd immunity）来防控新型冠状病毒。
In a nutshell, Britain's vaccination strategy was & quot; not to guard against the disease; to tolerate slow progress; to expect most people to be asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms after a hidden infection; and to gain universal immunization against the disease, or to control the new coronavirus through group immunity.
群体免疫（图片来源：华山感染）鲍里斯的言论也引发舆论关注。

“豪赌！”英国天空电视台的评论批评群体免疫策略是在冒险；伦敦资深病危护理专家西蒙·埃希沃斯（Simon Ashworth）则直呼政府，“快醒醒”。
"Gamble!" British Sky TV's commentary criticizes the group's immunization strategy as risky; Simon Ashworth, a senior London care expert, calls the government "wake up."
据央视新闻15日报道，目前已有超10万人在请愿书上签字，呼吁英国政府采取“更积极的方式”，阻止疫情蔓延。
More than 100,000 people have signed the petition, calling on the British government to take a "more active approach" to stop the epidemic, CCTV reported Wednesday.
请愿书说，英国有必要效仿意大利，限制一切非必要市镇间人员流动，同时限制大型集会。
The petition says Britain needs to follow Italy's lead by restricting the movement of all non-essential municipalities, as well as large gatherings.
按英国相关规定，请愿人数超过10万，议会就应考虑对相关议题进行辩论。
In the UK, where the number of petitioners exceeds 100,000, Parliament should consider debating the issue.
此外，英国有300多科学界学者、200多名心理学/行为学家分别发表了公开信，反对英国政府这一政策，质疑“群体免疫”的目标能否实现。
In addition, more than 300 scientific scholars and more than 200 psychologists / behaviorists in the UK have issued open letters opposing the British government's policy and questioning whether the goal of "mass immunization" can be achieved.
据英国天空电视台15日消息，英国卫生大臣马特·汉考克表示：“‘群体免疫’不是我们的目标或政策——它是一个科学概念。
"Group immunization is not our goal or policy - it is a scientific concept," British Health Minister Matt Hancock said on Sunday.
我们的政策是保护生命，战胜这种病毒。
Our policy is to protect lives and defeat the virus.

据参考消息援引路透社报道，英国独立电视公司政治栏目主编罗伯特·佩斯顿说，英国政府很快将指示英国年龄超过70岁的人士严格隔离4个月，这是因应新冠病毒肺炎疫情计划的一部分。
The British government will soon order people over the age of 70 to remain in strict quarantine for four months as part of a plan to tackle the new Crown Virus Pneumonia epidemic, independent television company Robert Peston was quoted as saying.
佩斯顿说，英国政府很可能在今后5到20天实施“战时”动员。
Pasterton said the British government is likely to implement "wartime" mobilization over the next five to 20 days.
计划中的其他措施包括强制征用宾馆和其他设施作为临时医院和征用私立医院。
Other planned measures include the forced requisition of hotels and other facilities as temporary hospitals and the requisition of private hospitals.
据天空新闻网，英国卫生大臣汉考克（Matt Hancock）表示，“未来几周内英国70岁以上老人将被要求待在室内，以保护他们免受冠状病毒感染。
According to Sky News, Matt Hancock, Britain's health minister, said: "In the next few weeks people over 70 in the UK will be asked to stay indoors to protect them from coronavirus infection.
”另据《每日邮报》报道，为应对新冠肺炎疫情，英国政府计划进一步出台的措施包括：部署军队到医院和超市；数以千计的私人医院床位将被征用，以缓解英国国家医疗服务体系（NHS）的压力；敦促企业为了国家利益扩大生产线，以生产呼吸机等基本医疗设备；如果一个家庭有一名成员被感染，整个家庭将被隔离；英国警方正计划对轻罪不予追究，只对涉及人身安全的犯罪进行调查，以释放警力。
In response to the outbreak, the government plans to deploy troops to hospitals and supermarkets, expropriate thousands of private hospital beds to ease pressure on the NHS, urge companies to expand production lines to produce basic medical equipment such as ventilators if one family member is infected, and police are planning not to prosecute minor offences but to investigate crimes involving personal safety to free police.
“群体免疫”策略是否靠谱？那么英国提出的“群体免疫”概念是否靠谱？华山医院感染科主任张文宏在其公众微信号华山感染中表示，这是有理论的基础。
So is the UK's concept of "mass immunization" sound? Zhang Wenhong, director of the Infection Department at Huashan Hospital, said in his public micro-signal Huashan infection that there was a theoretical basis.
首先是流行病学的理论——普遍免疫可以形成稳态。
The first is the epidemiological theory that universal immunity can form homeostasis.
而一个现实则是，这次新冠疫情同样也存在着大部分感染患者为无症状或仅为轻症，可以在不经治疗或者对症治疗后自限性痊愈的特点；此外，英国政府在发布会上也重申新冠的死亡率是1%。
The reality is that the new crown is also characterized by asymptomatic or mild cases that can be self-limiting without treatment or symptomatic treatment. The government also reaffirmed at a news conference that the new crown death rate is 1%.
因此，通过放开疫情的防控，让大量人口感染后自愈获得免疫力，然后集中医疗力量救治人群中的危重症患者，也就是说不在防“感染”上花成本，而尽在防“死亡”上花成本。
So, by liberalizing the control of the epidemic, allowing large numbers of people to recover from infection to acquire immunity, and then pooling medical efforts to treat critically ill patients in the population, that is, not spending money on "infection," but on preventing "death."
在控制疫情的同时不会因为严格的管控措施牺牲社会活力和经济发展，尽量减小抗击疫情的代价，这就是英国所行策略背后的逻辑。
Controlling the epidemic without sacrificing social dynamism and economic development to minimise the cost of fighting the epidemic is the logic behind Britain's approach.
但是这样的一种“群体免疫“方式看似理论上可行，实际上是否真的能够成功，仍然存在着很多不确定的因素。
But there is still much uncertainty about whether such a "mass immunization" approach, which seems theoretically feasible, can actually succeed.
从中国的经验来看，中国竭尽全力保障了公民不受感染，在防控上不惜以牺牲经济为代价，在短时间内迅速降低了病毒的社区内传播，并迅速恢复社会秩序，竭力恢复社会经济的发展。
From China's experience, China has spared no effort to protect its citizens from infection, at the expense of the economy, by rapidly reducing the spread of the virus in its communities within a short period of time, and by rapidly restoring social order and striving to restore socio-economic development.
但是由于中国国家强大的决心和民众的配合力，这并不是其他国家都能够抄的作业。
But thanks to the country's strong resolve and its citizens "combined efforts, this is not something that any other country can copy.
