实习生 于洋 澎湃新闻记者 赵思维2月5日晚，湖北武汉洪山体育馆改造的武昌方舱医院开始接收首批新冠肺炎轻症患者。
Intern Yu Yang Pai journalists Zhao thinking February 5 night, Hubei Wuhan Hongshan Stadium renovated Wuchang Square Hospital began to receive the first patients with mild pneumonia.
至11日8时，武昌方舱医院先后投入120名医生、400名护士的医护力量，目前仍有437位轻症患者在接受治疗。
By 0800 hours on the 11th, Wuchang Fang Hospital had put in 120 doctors and 400 nurses, and 437 light cases were still being treated.
来自江西井冈山大学附属医院驰援武汉的护士杨群，成为这里首批入驻的医护人员。
Yang Qun, a nurse from Jinggangshan University Hospital in Jiangxi Province, became the first hospital to be admitted here.
杨群是两个孩子的母亲，大儿子12岁，小女儿只有5岁，父母皆已年迈，且公公身患肾脏病，一周需三次血液透析，家里本离不开她。
Yang Qun is the mother of two children, a 12-year-old son and a five-year-old daughter, both of whom are elderly and have kidney problems, and need hemodialysis three times a week.
但是当杨群决定报名驰援武汉时，家人选择了支持她。
But when Yang Qun decided to sign up to help Wuhan, her family chose to support her.
杨群的大儿子对她说，“妈妈，那里有更多的生病的人需要你照顾，等他们都好了，你就可以回家了。
Yang Qun's eldest son said to her, "Mom, there are more sick people who need you to take care of them. When they are all well, you can go home.
”带着家人的挂念和同事的祝福，杨群2月5日来到武汉，在基础知识及技能培训后，2月7日进入方舱医院正式工作。
With his family and colleagues' wishes, Yang Qun arrived in Wuhan on February 5 and entered the cabin hospital on February 7 after basic knowledge and skills training.
虽然曾是ICU的护士，但杨群之前只穿过隔离衣，没接触过防护服，防护服的穿戴成为了她最大的难题。
Although she was a nurse with the ICU, Yang had previously worn only protective clothing, which made it her biggest challenge.
“临床十多年，这是我第一次经历这么大的疫情，我知道穿防护服的重要性，我只有先把自己保护好，才能更好地照顾病人”。
"After more than 10 years of clinical practice, this is the first time I have experienced such an epidemic. I know the importance of wearing protective clothing.
杨群2月11日告诉澎湃新闻，当时培训结束后，她吃了几口午饭，就开始练习穿脱防护服，穿了脱、脱了穿，每一个细节她都不放过。
Yang told the roar news on Feb. 11 that after a few lunches, she began to practice wearing protective clothing, off and off, every detail she would not miss.
当悉心照顾换来患者竖起的大拇指时，杨群觉得这一切都值得。
Yang Qun felt it was all worth it when he took good care of the patient's thumbs up.

The patient gave her thumbs-up treatment at the hospital. Yang Qun was mainly responsible for observing their condition, supervising patients to take medicine on time, and helping to distribute fruit and milk.
此外，安抚患者的情绪同样是她工作的重点。
In addition, soothing the patient's mood is the focus of her work.
50多岁的周伯被检测为疑似病例，没有确诊，被安置在方舱医院隔离观察。
Zhou Bo, in his fifties, was tested as a suspected case, undiagnosed, and placed in quarantine at the cabin hospital.
由于担心自己的病情，加之挂念家人，周伯一直情绪低落。
Worried about his illness, and worried about his family, Zhou Bo has been depressed.
发放晚餐的杨群见到周先生一个人躺在病床上着急，便主动招呼他吃饭。
Yang Qun, who distributed the dinner, saw Mr. Zhou lying alone on the bed worried, so he took the initiative to greet him to eat.
趁着周伯吃饭的间隙，杨群询问起他家人的情况，为了增强对方信心，她还对周伯出现症状便自我隔离的行为进行了分析和肯定。
Taking advantage of Zhou Bo's lunch break, Yang Qun asked about his family. To strengthen her confidence, she also analyzed and affirmed Zhou Bo's behavior of self-isolation when he developed symptoms.
杨群安慰说，“不要担心家里人，现在什么都不要想，好好配合治疗，一定会好起来的。
"Don't worry about your family. Don't think about anything now," Yang said.
”杨群的一番安慰，让周伯潸然泪下。
"Yang Qun's consolation brought tears to Zhou's eyes.
他一边感谢杨群对自己的关心，一边为杨群竖起了大拇指。
While thanking Yang Qun for his concern, he raised his thumb for Yang Qun.
周伯说，自己很少掉眼泪，但这一次，却被杨群的贴心安慰感动了，周围的病友见此情形，也纷纷红了眼圈。
Zhou Bo said that he rarely shed tears, but this time, was moved by Yang Qun's close comfort, around the patient see this situation, also red eyes.
周伯竖起的大拇指，对于杨群来说是莫大的肯定和鼓励。
Zhou Bo erect thumb, for Yang Qun is a great affirmation and encouragement.
“我觉得我这一次真的是来对了，这里的病人需要我，我所有的付出都是值得的，他们和我说的每一声谢谢都让我非常感动，他们一定都会好起来的！”杨群感慨地说。
"I think I really came to the right time this time, the patients here need me, all my efforts are worth it, they and I said every thank you are very moved, they will all be well!" Yang Qun said.
疫情消散后，回家给儿子补过生日2月4日凌晨，杨群接到了出发驰援武汉的消息，6天之后，是她大儿子13岁生日。
Yang Qun received the news of her departure for Wuhan in the early morning of February 4. Six days later, it was her eldest son's 13th birthday.
原本答应要好好给儿子过生日的杨群，这一次失约了。
Originally promised to give his son a good birthday Yang Qun, this time missed the appointment.
接到出发消息的杨群，给儿子留下一封信，向儿子道歉，并承诺一定给儿子补过生日。
Yang Qun, who received the news of his departure, left a letter to his son apologizing and promising to make up for his son's birthday.
信里写道：“妈妈知道你是一个懂事的孩子，妈妈要去帮助武汉，你不是经常说我们要互相帮助，这也是妹妹经常挂在嘴边上的。
"Mom knows you are a sensible child, mother to help Wuhan, you do not often say we should help each other, this is my sister often hanging on the lips.
……下周一就是你的生日，昨天晚上妈妈还说要陪你过生日，可是妈妈又要失约了。
Next Monday is your birthday. Last night my mother said she would accompany you on your birthday, but she had to break it again.
真的对不起！不过没有关系，妈妈回来以后陪你再过一个，好吗？”大儿子看到信后并没有责怪杨群，而是安慰她说没关系，并叮嘱杨群注意安全。
I'm really sorry, but it doesn't matter, mother came back to accompany you for another, okay? "The eldest son read the letter and did not blame Yang Qun, but comforted her that it was okay, and asked Yang Qun to pay attention to safety.
孩子是杨群的软肋，谈及孩子，一直笑着的杨群开始掉泪。
The child is Yang Qun's soft rib, speaking of the child, has been laughing Yang Qun began to shed tears.
杨群说自己一直都在ICU工作，陪伴家人，特别是两个孩子的时间特别少，虽然孩子们很懂事，能够体谅自己的工作，但她还是觉得亏欠孩子太多。
Yang said she has been working at the ICU, spending particularly little time with her family, especially her two children, who, although sensible and considerate of their work, feel they owe too much to their children.
“等疫情消散，我就马上回家，给儿子补过一个生日。
"When the epidemic clears, I'll go home and make up for my son's birthday.
”江西援助武汉医疗护理队。
Jiangxi aided the Wuhan medical care team.
以下为杨群多篇日记：2020.2.5一觉醒来，像往常一样。
The following is a diary written by Yang Qun: 2020.2.5 Wake up as usual.
习惯性看一下时间，凌晨1点35分。
Get used to looking at the time, 1: 35 in the morning.
时间过得很快，感觉就像做梦一样，昨天还在吉安，今天就奋斗在武汉了。
Time passed quickly, feeling like a dream, yesterday was still in Jian, today is struggling in Wuhan.
昨天就是这个时候，我接到江西省第二批驰援湖北医疗队前往武汉增援的通知，可能是由于昨天太疲惫了，我早早就休息了，我也知道只有劳逸结合，才能有力气到前线。
Yesterday, I was informed that the second batch of medical teams from Hubei province was sent to Wuhan to reinforce them. Maybe it was because I was so tired yesterday that I took an early rest.
可能是由于我作为首批的后备人员，不管是心理还是身体我都做了充分的准备，时刻等待召唤的心态，此时此刻我的内心十分淡定从容的！接到通知后，我通知了我弟弟和我爱人，没打算告诉我爸爸、妈妈和我公公。
Perhaps because I was well prepared as the first reserve, psychologically and physically, to wait for the call, my mind was calm at the moment! At this moment I informed my brother and my wife that I had no intention of telling my father-in-law, mother and father-in-law.
我怕他们担心，特别是我公公，一星期三次血透，他身体不好。
I'm afraid they're worried, especially my father-in-law, who's bleeding three times a week. He's out of shape.
没想到弟弟还是告诉了家人，其实我也理解弟弟告诉父母，我是不想他们为我担心，我想等我出发了，我再把我临时写的信转发到他们的微信当中。
Unexpectedly, my brother told his family, in fact, I also understand my brother told his parents, I do not want them worried about me, I would like to wait for me to start, I would like to forward my temporary letter to their message.
其实我知道，爸、妈、公公还有家里人很担心我，但是他们还是都很支持着我的，特别是我公公，因为他也是一名党员！现在还很清晰地记住妈妈说的话，她说女儿，你一定要平平安安地回来，我生了四个孩子，你是最乖最棒的，我们为你骄傲。
In fact, I know, Dad, mom, father-in-law and family are very worried about me, but they are very supportive, especially my father-in-law, because he is also a Party member!
我安慰妈妈，我长大了，我会注意安全，做好防护，不用担心。
I comfort my mother, I grow up, I will pay attention to safety, protection, do not worry.
整理好心情，我来到了井冈山大学附属医院门诊大厅。
To tidy up my mood, I came to Jinggangshan University Hospital out-patient hall.
出征前，井冈山大学黄俭根校长、井冈山大学附属医院张波书记、井冈山大学附属医院曾常爱院长、王政华书记、护理部陈小英主任、刘昱昕主任、方全凤护士长等多名领导、同志来到了医院集结地看望慰问白衣战士，为我们鼓励送行。
Before the war, many leaders and comrades such as President Huang Jingang University, Secretary Zhang Bo of Jinggangshan University Hospital, Secretary of Jinggangshan University Affiliated Hospital had always loved Dean Wang Zhenghua, Director of Nursing Department Chen Xiaoying, Director Liu Yu-xin, Master Fang Quanfeng and other leaders and comrades visited the White Clothes Soldier and encouraged us to send off.
满载着领导的嘱托和牵挂，同事同学们、朋友们的真诚祝福、亲人们的不舍和期待，我和本院呼吸内科的王婷、章小丹两位小妹妹坚定逆行，奔向需要我的患者身边，奔向最危险的前线！一路上太多太多领导的关心和厚爱、太多同事们亲朋好友的美好祝福来不及一一回复，在此说一句抱歉。
Full of testamentary trust and care, colleagues and friends sincere blessings, relatives and expectations, I and the hospital breathing medicine Wang Ting, Zhang Xiaodan two small sister-in-law to the needs of my patients, rushed to the most dangerous frontline!
在他们美好的祝福中我们来到了美丽的英雄城南昌。
In their beautiful blessing we came to the beautiful city of Nanchang.
16时，与省101各护理人员组成的江西援助武汉的护理队集结完毕，整装待发。
At 1600 hours, with the province 101 nurses of Jiangxi assistance to Wuhan care team assembled, ready to send.
江西省卫生健康党委组主任曾传美到机场送行，为白衣护理人员授旗。
The director of the Jiangxi Health Party committee has been seen off at the airport to award flags to nurses in white.
在此，我庄严宣誓：传承弘扬南丁格尔精神；不忘初心，牢记使命；直面疫情，迎难而上；听从指挥，众志成城；担当尽责，护佑生命；不负重托，不辱使命；坚决与疫区人民同呼吸、共命运，圆满完成援助任务，向党和人民交上一份满意答卷。
I solemnly declare here that I will continue to carry forward the spirit of Nightingale, remember the first mind, remember the mission, face the epidemic and rise to the occasion, fulfill our duty and protect our lives, live up to our destiny and breathe with the people of the affected areas.
宣誓人：杨群2020.2.6带上自己的阳光，向春天出发今天是立春，立春就是意味着冬天即将过去，春暖花开、阳光明媚的春天来临了！对我而言今天是一个非常特殊的日子、今天是到达武汉的第一天，也是我第一次来到武汉，也很荣幸加入了驰援武汉的护理团队。
2020.2.6 Take Your Own Sun With Your Sunshine 2020.2.6 Take Your Own Sunshine to Spring Today is the spring, spring means the winter is almost over, spring blooming, sunny spring! For me, today is a very special day, today is the first day to reach Wuhan, it is my first time to Wuhan, and I am honored to join the nursing team to help Wuhan.
虽然工作了许多年，但是第一次面对如此烈性的疫情，内心还是有些害怕的。
Although working for many years, but for the first time in the face of such a strong epidemic, the heart is still a little afraid.
今天上午参加了由湖北省人民医院安排接受名医专家关于冠状病毒的肺炎的治疗及防护知识的培训，似乎也没有想象中的那么可怕。
This morning, I attended the training arranged by Hubei Provincial People's Hospital for the treatment and protection of coronavirus pneumonia by a famous medical expert.
我想答案非常简单，我们的初心就是救死扶伤，白衣天使的实名就是对抗疾病，照顾患者！作为一名党员，穿上这身白大褂，就扛起了医者的职责和使命！就必须在危难时刻冲在最前线！上午在武汉市人民医院进行了专业的培训后，我们就来到了即将工作的地方——方舱医院。
I think the answer is very simple, our first heart is to save lives, white angel's real name is to fight disease, take care of patients! As a Party member, wearing this white coat, we must shoulder the duties and missions of the healer!
方舱医院位于洪山体育馆，馆内的工作人员都在紧张忙碌的工作中，他们为患者准备了生活用品，有的区域和设施都在不断地完善当中。
Located at the Hongshan Stadium, the staff of the Fangshan Hospital are busy working to prepare daily necessities for the patients. Some areas and facilities are constantly being improved.
由于晚上就要上班，时间就是生命，刚吃上几口饭，我们就开始进行了魔鬼般的训练。
As we have to work at night, time is life, just a few mouthfuls of food, we began to train like demons.
因为我们深知，防护是重中之重，来不得半点马虎，所有的队友都非常自觉地练习。
Because we know, the protection is the most important, not half carelessly, all the team-mates are very conscious of the practice.
看似一件简单的防护服，穿脱可不是一件简单的事情，特别是脱的时候，有严格的要求。
Seemingly a simple protective clothing, wear is not a simple matter, especially when off, there are strict requirements.
不管是在任何一个细节，我们都要小心翼翼地穿脱。
No matter in any detail, we have to wear it carefully.
为了零感染，所有的队友们反反复复地练习，穿了脱，脱了穿，一练就到深夜了。
In order to zero infection, all the teammates time and again practice, wear off, take off, one practice late at night.
为了避免感染，我们就有爱美的女生生生地把自己心爱的长发都剪了。
In order to avoid infection, we have beautiful girls born to cut their beloved long hair.
我们领队唐浪娟院长、余娇护士长反反复复地和我们强调安全、安全。
Our leader, Dean Tang Longjuan and Head Nurse Yu Jiao, have repeatedly stressed safety and security with us.
我们每个的组长考核每一个组员，都过关了才可以上岗，为了能够打赢这场战，大家都不惜一切努力，我相信，只要大家齐心协力，共同克服困难，我们共同静候春暖花开！2020.2.816点我们同组的8名战士们准备开始一天的工作。
In order to be able to win the battle, we all do everything we can to overcome the difficulties.Together, we are waiting for the spring blooming! 2020.816 The eight soldiers of our group are ready to start the day's work.
今天是我第二天加班，工作起来似乎好了许多，我今天接班的患者还是西区的第九组的20个患者。
Today is my second day of overtime, work seems to be a lot better, I take over today's patients or the ninth group of West Side 20 patients.
大家看见我来了，非常友好地说“小杨你来了接班了”。
You see me coming, very friendly said, "Xiao Yang you have come to take over."
当我听到这句话的时候觉得很亲切，不再是那么陌生了。
When I heard these words, I felt very friendly, no longer so strange.
我准备了当天晚上写的一些贺卡拿到了我的患者面前，我上面写着：加油，我们一定能胜利！此时此刻我深知，因为方舱医院的都是轻症患者，对于我们医护人员来讲，最重要的是和患者做好心理护理，让他们树立信心，战胜疫病，注意个人卫生，积极配合治疗，劳逸结合，所以我觉得我们要从他们的心理方面着手。
I had prepared some of the cards I had written that night for my patients, and I wrote: Come on, we will win! I know at this moment that the most important thing for our staff is to provide psychological care to the patients so that they can build confidence, fight epidemics, pay attention to personal hygiene, actively cooperate with the treatment, work and escape, so I think we should start from their psychological aspects.
还没等我说完，我听到了患者的掌声，看到了他们眼里含着激动的泪水了。
Before I had finished, I heard the applause from the patients and saw the tears welling up in their eyes.
他们来到医院，面对陌生的环境，带着对家人的不舍，及亲人们的担忧及疫情的种种担心。
They came to the hospital, facing a strange environment, with family members reluctant, and relatives worried about the epidemic.
所以我要和大家打气，我们要有足够的信心战胜疫情，和家人团圆！加油我们一定能胜利的！祝大家元宵节快乐！2020.2.10妈妈和病毒的比赛还没有结束。
So I would like to cheer you up, we have to have enough confidence to overcome the epidemic, and family reunion! Come on, we will be able to win! Happy Lantern Festival! 2020.2.10 Mom and the virus game is not over.
等妈妈胜利了，就可以回家陪你们过生日了，子涵，好好照顾妹妹！今天是儿子的生日，不能陪孩子共同度过，特别担心他会不高兴！和他通过视频时，太让我出乎意料了，儿子说：“妈妈，没事的，你安心工作，我会照顾妹妹的！等你回来在和我一起过生日！”儿子说了一句非常暖心的话：“妈妈早睡早起，保证精力！”。
When my mother won, I could go home with you for your birthday, and bear with you! Today is my son's birthday, can not spend with the children, especially worried about his unhappy!
突然间感觉儿子长大了！也感谢儿子的理解！真的是一个大小伙子！“妹妹在干什么呀？”儿子赶紧叫来妹妹接电话。
Suddenly feel son grow up! Also thank son understanding! Really is a big boy! "What is sister doing?" The son hastens to call sister to answer the phone.
女儿张口就问：“妈妈你在哪里呢？”“我在武汉呀！”“那你什么时候回来呀？”“妈妈要去照顾好生病的爷爷奶奶叔叔阿姨们，把病毒全部消灭了妈妈就回来了。
The daughter opened her mouth and asked, "Where are you, mother?" "I am in Wuhan!" "When will you come back?" "Mother will take good care of the sick grandparents, aunt and uncle, and destroy the virus mother came back.
”“妈妈我好想你。
"I missed you so much, Mom.
好想你帮我买戒指糖。
I want you to buy me a ring candy.
”“等妈妈回来了，就买给你好吗？”“好呀！”我告诉女儿，妈妈和病毒的比赛还没有结束。
"When Mom comes back, will you buy it for you?" "Fine!" I told my daughter that the match between mother and virus was not over yet.
等结束后妈妈就可以回来陪你们了，妈妈好好加油，妈妈你是一名党员，是一名护士，现在国家有难时我们必须互相帮助。
After the end of the mother can come back with you, mother good refueling, mother you are a party member, is a nurse, now we have to help each other when the country is in trouble.
“我们老师也说了。
"Our teacher said so, too.
”“是呀，（太吃惊了）只有守好这座城，我们国家才能国泰民安！”孩子们异口同声说，妈妈加油！中国加油！一块蛋糕一桶方便面陪孩子庆祝生日，妈妈祝你生日快乐！身体健康！平平安安！学习更上一层楼！我们都要加油哦！……本期编辑邢潭推荐阅读。
"Yes, (so surprised) Only by keeping this city safe can our country live in peace!" said the children in unison. "Come on, mother! Come on, China! A bucket of instant noodles with your children to celebrate your birthday. Happy birthday! Health! Peace!
