记者/韩谦编辑/计巍宋建华正在进行康复训练的被感染医生陆俊1月29日，在经过两次核酸检测均为阴性后，陆俊从金银潭医院ICU转回同济医院普通病房治疗。
Reporter / Han Qian editor / Jianhua Jianhua is undergoing rehabilitation training The infected doctor, Lu Jun, was transferred from the ICU of Gold and Silver Pool Hospital to the General Ward of Tongji Hospital on January 29 after two negative nucleic acid tests.
他目前仍存在呼吸困难的症状，需高流量吸氧治疗。
He still suffers from dyspnea and needs high-volume oxygen therapy.
陆俊表示，自己目前肺部有一定好转，但好转不多，“对于我这样的重症者来说，恢复时间会比较长。
Lu said his lungs have improved, but not much. "For people like me, the recovery will take longer."
”1月5日晚，30岁的同济医院急诊科医生陆俊出现发热症状，1月10日因“病毒性肺炎”住院，17日转至金银潭医院ICU治疗。
On the night of January 5, Lu Jun, a 30-year-old emergency doctor at Tongji Hospital, developed fever. He was hospitalized with viral pneumonia on January 10 and transferred to the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital on January 17 for treatment.
陆俊表示，自己并不清楚确诊为新冠肺炎的确切日期，但肯定是1月17日转院前确诊。
Mr Luk said he did not know the exact date of the new crown pneumonia but was sure it was diagnosed before the hospital was transferred on January 17.
同济医院急诊和重症医学科主任李树生此前在接受央视采访时说，在武汉早期染病的医护人员里，陆俊是最重的一个。
Li Shusheng, director of emergency and severe medicine at Tongji Hospital, said in an interview with CCTV that Lu was the heaviest of the medical staff infected early in Wuhan.
1月20日下午，钟南山院士首度证实，已存在人际传染和医务人员感染。
On the afternoon of January 20th, academician Zhong Nan Shan confirmed for the first time the existence of human-to-human transmission and medical infection.
次日凌晨1时45分，武汉市卫健委通过官方微博发布消息，称该市共有15名医务人员确诊为新冠肺炎，另有1名为疑似病例。
At 1: 45 a.m. the next morning, Wuhan city health committee issued a message through the official Weibo, said a total of 15 medical personnel in the city confirmed as New Crown Pneumonia, and one suspected case.
16例患者中，危重症1例。
Of the 16 patients, one was critically ill.
陆俊目前服用的药物呼吸仍困难，开始进行康复训练深一度：你现在身体状况怎么样？陆俊：我从1月29日从金银潭医院重症监护室转回同济医院普通病房，现在应该是属于恢复期。
Mr Luk is still having difficulty breathing and is undergoing rehabilitation training: How are you doing now? Lu Jun: I was transferred back to the general ward of Tongji Hospital from the intensive care unit of Yingtan Hospital on January 29. It should be the recovery period.
目前除呼吸困难外，像发热、咳嗽、肌肉酸痛、乏力这些症状都没有了。
At present, in addition to breathing difficulties, such as fever, cough, muscle pain, fatigue these symptoms are gone.
缺氧还是很明显，需要高流量吸氧治疗，离开氧气就不行了。
Hypoxia is still very obvious, the need for high-flow oxygen treatment, not without oxygen.
现在可以自己下地走动，不过输氧的管子只有1米多， 只能在这个半径范围内走动。
Now I can walk around on my own, but the oxygen pipe is more than a meter long and can only move within this radius.
目前说话还不是很顺畅。
At the moment it's not very smooth.
深一度：目前恢复期的治疗主要包括哪些？陆俊：现在已经没有输液了，治疗包括口服药物和康复训练这两个方面。
One degree: What are the main treatments for convalescent patients? Lu Jun: There is no infusion now. Treatment includes oral medicine and rehabilitation training.
药物主要包括糖皮质激素，有减少肺泡渗出和有一定的抗病毒作用，还有化痰的药物，以及防止肺纤维化的药物和减少气道高反应性的药物。
Drugs include glucocorticoids, drugs that reduce alveolar effusion and have some antiviral effects, sputum-reducing drugs, and drugs to prevent pulmonary fibrosis and reduce airway hyperreactivity.
现在还会做一些针对肺部功能恢复的训练。
There will be some training now for lung function recovery.
一方面是活动活动四肢、关节，二就是做呼吸运动，有护士带着我做。
On the one hand, I move my limbs and joints, and on the other hand, I do breathing exercises with a nurse.
一次做十几分钟到半个小时，一次训练持续不了很长时间。
Do it for ten minutes to half an hour at a time. One session does not last long.
现在一天做两到三次训练，主要在上午和下午，有时候晚上也会做。
Now train two or three times a day, mostly in the morning and afternoon, and sometimes at night.
深一度：当时转院回同济医院，是因为病情出现了好转吗？陆俊：国家第四版诊疗方案规定了解除隔离和出院标准。
Once deep: was the hospital transferred back to Tongji Hospital because of the improvement in his condition? Lu Jun: The fourth edition of the National Diagnosis and Treatment Programme stipulates the criteria for release from isolation and discharge.
一是体温恢复正常3天以上，第二是呼吸道症状明显好转，第三是间隔至少1天的两次病原核酸检测都是阴性。
First, the body temperature returned to normal for more than three days, the second was a marked improvement in respiratory symptoms, and the third was negative testing for both pathogenic nucleic acids at least one day apart.
我在1月26号和28号分别做了两次核酸检测，大概是这个时间，检测结果都是阴性的。
I had two nucleic acid tests, on January 26 and January 28, respectively. At about that time, the results were negative.
在呼吸方面，我最严重的时候用的无创呼吸机，后来又换成高流量吸氧，吸氧机给的氧气浓度也逐渐从最高的90%降到50%左右，有了一些好转，但也还没达到出院的状态。
When it came to breathing, the non-invasive respirator I used in my most serious cases was replaced by a high-flow oxygen inhaler, which gradually reduced the oxygen concentration from the top 90% to about 50%.
我满足这几个条件后，经过专家组同意，就在29号转回同济医院。
Having met these conditions, I was transferred back to Tongji Hospital on 29 with the consent of the Group of Experts.
按照指南来说，我已经没有传染性了，但现在同济医院的病房还是按隔离的标准进行。
According to the guide, I'm no longer contagious, but the wards at Tongji Hospital are still segregated.
我住的是一个单间，目前禁止探视，照顾我的护士也都采取了三级防护措施。
I live in a single room, and no visits are allowed at the moment, and the nurses who look after me have taken protective measures at three levels.
深一度：这两次结果为阴性的核酸检测，大概在检测多长时间后你能知道结果？陆俊：24小时以后。
Deep One: These two negative nucleic acid tests, how long will it take you to know the results? Luk Jun: In 24 hours.
我当时做检测的标本是送到市里的疾控中心做的，现在我不知道能不能在医院里面做。
The specimen I was doing was sent to the CDC in the city, and now I don't know if I can do it in the hospital.
深一度：现在肺部CT有好转吗？陆俊：我最后一次肺部CT是在五六天前拍的。
One degree: Is lung CT better now? Lu Jun: My last lung CT was taken five or six days ago.
目前有好转，肺部的炎症面积在减少，但是好转不多。
There has been an improvement in the area of inflammation in the lungs, but not much.
对于新冠肺炎的重症患者来说，恢复时间会比较长。
In severe cases of new crown pneumonia, recovery time will be longer.
我生病到现在已经28天，还不知道什么时候可以出院，得看自己的恢复情况。
I've been ill for 28 days and I don't know when I'll be able to leave the hospital, depending on my recovery.
病情好转后，陆俊转回同济医院普通病房治疗此前曾接诊30余名发热患者深一度：最早是在什么时候出现发热症状？陆俊：1月5日晚上7点多，当时高烧是38.7度。
After his condition improved, Lu Jun returned to the general ward of Tongji Hospital for treatment of more than 30 febrile patients. When did he first develop fever symptoms? Lu Jun: January 5 at 7 pm, when the fever was 38.7 degrees.
那天我正好休息在家，但在发烧3小时后就去医院检查了。
I happened to be at home that day, but I went to the hospital for a check-up three hours after my fever.
我作为一个医务人员，反应可能会比普通人快一些。
As a medical worker, I'm likely to react faster than the average person.
当时根据症状判断，我就觉得不是感冒，最开始怀疑可能是流感，因为我觉得跟平时感冒差距还是很大的。
At that time, judging from the symptoms, I felt not cold, the first suspicion may be the flu, because I think with the usual cold gap is still very big.
一是当时发烧温度相对比较高，二是乏力的症状太明显了，整个人一双腿支撑不住身体，就感觉要垮下来一样。
First, the temperature of fever was relatively high, and second, the symptoms of fatigue is too obvious, the whole body can not support a pair of legs, will feel broken down.
我觉得很不对劲，我平时身体状态还可以，已经有一年多没感冒了。
I don't feel right. I'm still in good shape. I haven't had a cold for more than a year.
深一度：当时在医院做了哪些检查？陆俊： 查了血常规，显示单核细胞增高，反映出有病毒性感染，还做了肺部CT，显示右下肺有少量渗出。
At one degree: What tests were done at the hospitalLu Jun: I checked the blood routine, showed an increase in monocytes, reflected a viral infection, and made a lung CT, showing a small amount of seepage from the lower right lung.
当时症状也不严重，没有呼吸困难，只是发烧，还以为是普通的病毒性肺炎，没有和当时的不明原因肺炎联系起来。
Symptoms were not serious, there was no dyspnea, and fever was thought to be common viral pneumonia, which was not associated with unexplained pneumonia at the time.
深一度：在医院工作时会接诊发热病人吗？陆俊：会的。
One degree: Will you take in a feverish patient when you work in a hospital? Lujun: Yes.
发热门诊一般情况下主要针对的是一些长期发烧，找不到原因的发热待查病人，像发烧几天的病人都会来急诊科看。
Fever clinic is usually aimed at a number of long-term fever, can not find the cause of fever patients, like fever for a few days will come to the emergency department to see.
因为当时还很早，发热门诊当时还没有专门针对这个新冠肺炎开放。
Because it was still early, the fever clinic had not been opened specifically for the new crown pneumonia.
来我们那看病的发热患者都有一些比较相似的症状：发热、咳嗽、咽痛、肌肉酸痛。
The fever sufferers who come to see us all have similar symptoms: fever, cough, sore throat, sore muscles.
但在最早期也没有办法判断这到底是普通感冒、流感，还是新冠肺炎，当时不是很清楚。
But there was no way to tell at the earliest whether it was a common cold, flu or pneumonia.
深一度：当时过来就诊的发热病人多吗？陆俊：那段时间比较特殊的情况就是发热的病人很多。
Deep once: then came to see more patients with fever? Lu Jun: That time the more special case is the fever of a lot of patients.
一般情况下，本来冬季发热病人就会多一些，但从12月底到1月初，患者人数在成倍地增加。
Normally, there are more cases of fever in winter, but the number increases exponentially from the end of December to the beginning of January.
同济医院本身接待的病人就比较多，像急诊科一般情况下一天会有300人左右来看病，当时每天可能得有个五六百人。
Tongji Hospital itself receives more patients, such as the emergency department usually around 300 people a day to see a doctor, at that time there may be five to six hundred people per day.
我当时正好在进行专科医师培训，在我们医院神经外科学习。
I was training as a specialist in neurosurgery at our hospital.
但到1月初的时候，由于急诊科病人增多，人手不够，需要支援，我当时还没培训完，就因为这个临时任务，在1月2日又回到了急诊科工作。
By early January, however, I had not completed my training because of the increase in the number of emergency cases and the shortage of staff to support them.
我从1月2号上午开始工作，一直到1月3日上午，共工作了18个小时。
I began work on the morning of 2 January and worked for 18 hours until the morning of 3 January.
当时跟我一起轮班的还有两位医生，我接诊了30多名发热病人，比平时人数多了一倍左右。
I was on shift with two other doctors, and I treated more than 30 febrile patients, about twice as many as usual.
深一度：当时有采取什么防护措施吗？陆俊：当时就是戴N95防护口罩，还没有提到防护服和护目镜。
Once upon a time: What precautions were taken? Lu Jun: It was wearing a N95 face mask and there was no mention of protective clothing or goggles.
平时我们在急诊科看病的话一般是戴普通医用口罩。
Usually we wear ordinary medical masks when we see a doctor in an emergency department.
由于当时知道可能会有不明原因发热的病人，所以就提升了一个等级，但是没提到最高级别。
Knowing that there might be an unexplained febrile patient, the patient was promoted to a higher level but did not mention the highest level.
当时觉得病人数可能不多，防护也不是很到位。
It was felt that the number of patients might not be high and that protection was not adequate.
我们知道可能会有危险性，但对这个病情不是很了解，不清楚会有人传人，也不知道这个病毒传感性这样强，后来感染了这么多人。
We knew it might be dangerous, but we didn't know much about it, we didn't know it was going to be transmitted from person to person, we didn't know that the virus was so transmissible and it infected so many people.
深一度：你当时坐诊的时候，会给发热病人做什么检测？陆俊：血常规是肯定是必须的，有些病人做了咽拭子检测，查一下是否感染了甲流和乙流。
At one degree: What tests would you give to a feverish patient while you were sitting down? Lu Jun: Blood routine is definitely necessary. Some patients have had swabs tested to see if they are infected with Stream A and B.
有些病人发热时间在一周左右。
Some patients have fevers for about a week.
病人症状严重一些的，会做胸片。
If the patient has more serious symptoms, he will do a chest radiography.
当时做胸片的病人也不多，大部分发烧患者都是轻症病人，发热时间也不长，开点抗病毒药物、退烧止咳药物回家就可以了。
At that time, there were not many patients with chest film, most of the fever patients are mild patients, fever time is not long, open some anti-viral drugs, anti-cough medicine to go home.
输液的病人也不多。
The number of patients receiving transfusions is also low.
正在进行康复训练的陆俊1月17日前确诊为新冠肺炎深一度：1月5日发热后，你是什么时候开始住院的？陆俊：我从一开始去医院检查后就隔离了。
Rehabilitated patient Luk Joon was diagnosed with pneumonia on January 17. When did you begin to be hospitalized after fever on January 5? Lu Jun: I was quarantined since I first went to the hospital for a check-up.
当时是以流感隔离的，流感也有传染性，我家里有小孩，我就不能回家。
It was isolated with flu, it was contagious, I had kids at home and I couldn't go home.
因为我第二天要上班，5号晚上检查后就跟科室领导汇报了，当时主任也建议我隔离。
Because I have to go to work the next day, after the examination on the 5th night reported to the department leader, then the director also advised me to quarantine.
急诊科有个小病房，我就在那里隔离。
The emergency department has a small ward, and I'm quarantined there.
我服用了一些抗病毒和退烧的药物，到7号的时候高烧到39.5度，去复查了一次，CT显示左肺也开始出现感染的情况，当时打了些抗生素和激素类药物，但没住院，觉得除了高烧外也没别的症状，自己可以扛下去。
I took some antiviral and anti-fever drugs, and by 7, I had a high fever of 39.5 degrees. I went to a reexamination and CT showed that the left lung was also starting to get infected.
到10号再次复查的时候，已经连续高烧5天了，CT显示双肺感染面积增大，出现少量磨玻璃样病变，是以病毒性肺炎在呼吸内科病房住院的。
By the time of the second review, the fever had been high for five days and CT showed an increase in the area of bilateral lung infection, with a small number of ground glass-like lesions, which were hospitalized in the respiratory infirmary with viral pneumonia.
深一度：发烧之后有在上班吗？陆俊：没有，生病之后就没有上班了。
Once upon a time: Did you work after you had a fever? Lu Jun: No, I didn't go to work after I got sick.
深一度：当时医院里住院人数有没有明显增加？医护人员采取了什么防护措施？陆俊：那会儿太早了，还没有出现现在这样床位紧缺的状况。
At one degree: was there any significant increase in the number of hospitalizations in the hospital? What precautions were taken by the healthcare personnel? Lu Jun: It was too early and there was no shortage of beds as yet.
当时我住的病房里的医护人员已经开始进行三级防护措施了。
The paramedics in my ward had already begun implementing level-III protective measures.
深一度：当时有觉得可能感染新型肺炎了吗？你是什么时候确诊为新型肺炎？陆俊：我在10号刚住院的时候还以为是普通的病毒性肺炎。
At one degree: Did you think you might have contracted the new pneumonia? When did you diagnose the new pneumonia? Lu Jun: I thought it was common viral pneumonia when I was admitted to the hospital on 10th.
当时从5号到14号连续高烧有9天时间，一开始除了发热外，还有些肌肉酸痛和乏力，后来在12、13号左右慢慢出现呼吸困难的症状，14号开始进行高流量吸氧治疗，当时就真得扛不住，觉得可能是感染了新型肺炎。
He had a 9-day fever running from No.5 to 14. In addition to fever, he developed muscle soreness and fatigue. Later, he developed symptoms of dyspnea around 12 or 13.
具体确诊时间我记不清楚了，我是在1月17日转到金银潭医院的，肯定是转院前确诊的。
I can't remember exactly when. I was transferred to Gold and Silver Pool Hospital on January 17. It must have been diagnosed before it was transferred to hospital.
在医院给我填的红十字会救助基金上是1月7日确诊的，对于这个我现在也不是很清楚。
I was diagnosed on January 7 on the Red Cross rescue fund that the hospital had filled out for me, and I'm not sure yet.
深一度：当时为什么需要转院去金银潭医院？陆俊：医生就跟我说核酸检测是阳性，需要转去金银潭医院。
Once upon a time: Why was it necessary to transfer to the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital? Lu Jun: The doctor told me that the nucleic acid test was positive and needed to be transferred to the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital.
我直接被转去了金银潭医院的ICU，那个时候就很严重了，已经有呼吸衰竭的症状。
I was transferred directly to the ICU at the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital, where I was already suffering from respiratory failure.
当时体温是用激素控制住了，主要就是呼吸困难。
The temperature was controlled by hormones, mainly breathing difficulties.
那个时候基本说不了话，一开始四五天还使用了无创呼吸机。
At that time, I could hardly speak, and for the first four or five days I used a non-invasive ventilator.
深一度：从什么时候开始觉得病情加重？陆俊：是在1月15号到23号的时候病情最严重。
Once upon a time: When did you start to feel worse? Luk Jun: It was the most serious illness from January 15 to 23.
那段时间说话也很费劲，会引起呼吸困难。
It was also a difficult time to talk and cause breathing difficulties.
也基本不看手机，看不动。
Also basically do not look at the mobile phone, unable to see.
那段时间输液很多，从上午9:00开始输液，下午也有一次，晚上还有一次，要输到凌晨四五点。
There was a lot of fluid infusion, starting at 9: 00 am, one in the afternoon and one in the evening until 4 or 5 in the morning.
当时病情太严重了，一天输液估计得至少有10个小时左右。
It was so serious that the infusion was estimated to take at least 10 hours a day.
输液主要包括丙种球蛋白，激素、抗生素类药物，护胃的药物等。
Infusion mainly includes gamma globulin, hormones, antibiotics, stomach care drugs and so on.
深一度：在重症监护室里面治疗了几天？从什么时候开始病情出现好转？陆俊：一共在金银潭医院的ICU待了12天，直到1月29号转院。
One degree: How long was he treated in intensive care unit? Since when did his condition improve? Lu Jun: He spent 12 days at the ICU of Gold and Silver Pool Hospital until his transfer on January 29.
我是从23号开始输液量就慢慢减少，到大年初二，也就是26号就停止输液，改为口服药物。
I started from the 23rd infusion slowly reduced, to the second day of the New Year, that is, 26 on the stop of infusion, oral medicine.
比较明显的变化是在大年初一开始，可以下床活动了。
The more obvious change is in the beginning of New Year's Day, can get out of bed activities.
反正到现在为止，我恢复起来还是比较缓慢。
Anyway, my recovery has been slow so far.
因为当时肺损伤太严重了，两个肺都是白白的阴影，又叫白肺。
Because the lung injury was too serious, both lungs are white shadows, also known as the white lung.
深一度：你是不是你们医院最早出现感染症状的医生？ 据你了解还有几位同事被感染？陆俊：我是最早感染的里面最严重的那一个。
Once upon a time: Were you the first doctor in your hospital to develop symptoms of infection? According to your knowledge, several other colleagues were infected? Lu Jun: I was the first one with the most serious infection.
生病之后的这段时间我接受外界的消息比较少，我所知道的我们科室还有3人被感染。
In the period following my illness, I received relatively little news from the outside world. Three people in my department were infected as far as I know.
他们有一个是在1月18号左右，另外两个都是20多号。
One of them was around January 18th, and the other two were in their 20s.
深一度：之前有没有什么基础性疾病？陆俊：没有，什么病都没有。
Once upon a time: Is there any basic disease before? Lu Jun: No, nothing.
我就是有些肥胖，我身高1米7，生病前有90公斤。
I'm just a little fat. I'm 1.7 meters tall and 90 kilograms before I got sick.
深一度：治疗到现在自费医疗费用一共花了多少？陆俊：最开始没确诊的时候自己花了一两千，后来都是国家和医院在承担费用。
Once upon a time: How much has it cost to pay for out-of-pocket medical expenses? Lu Jun: He spent one or two thousand dollars on himself when he was first diagnosed, and it was the state and the hospital that paid for it.
包括吃饭的费用也是国家来承担。
The costs, including meals, are also borne by the State.
深一度：家里人的状况目前怎么样？陆俊：家里人一直都还好，现在可以用手机和他们交流。
Once upon a time: How are things at home? Lu Jun: My family has been fine. Now we can communicate with them by cell phone.
在武汉封闭离汉通道前，我老婆还是可以过来送饭的。
Before Wuhan closed the Han corridor, my wife could still come over to deliver food.
医院有专门的家属集中放东西的地方，再由医护人员统一送到病房。
The hospital has a special area for family members to put things together, which are then delivered to the wards by medical staff.
当时吃得很少，从家里带的还是比盒饭好吃一些。
At that time, eating very little, or from the home or a box of rice to eat better.
当时我老婆都是使用一次性的饭盒，送进病房的东西都是不能拿出来的，除非一些随身物品，比如手机、钱包，都是需要进行严格的消毒才能拿出来的。
At the time, my wife was using a disposable lunch box. Everything that came into the room could not be taken out, except that some accessories, such as mobile phones and wallets, needed to be strictly disinfected.
我孩子现在只有三岁，只知道爸爸现在生病了，现在每天都能通话，他说让我快点好起来，让我跟他玩。
My child is only three years old now, only to know that Dad is sick now, now that he can talk to me every day, he said let me get better soon, let me play with him.
