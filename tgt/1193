房地产并不能在经济大船外“独善其身”，它取决于两个外部因素：疫病的控制和经济的复苏图/IC1、和SARS期间的03年楼市没什么可比性在这场疫情中，关心楼市、讨论房价的人少了，这是一件好事。
It depends on two external factors: the control of epidemics and the recovery of the economy / IC1, and the lack of comparability of the 2003 housing market during SARS. In this epidemic, fewer people care about the housing market and discuss house prices, which is a good thing.
一些专业号针对2003年的SARS期间楼市走势进行了回顾：2002-2003年全国商品住宅成交面积（当月值）同比增速看，呈现明显的“倒U型”，2003年下半年与上半年相比，成交量同比增速下降11%。
Some professional issues for the period of SARS in 2003 reviewed the market trend: In 2002-2003, the national residential area (that is, the monthly value) showed a clear "inverted U-shaped," compared with the first half of 2003, volume growth fell 11% year-on-year.
2003年8月，国务院明确将房地产行业作为国民经济支柱产业，“救市”政策出台随后引发楼市过热，于2004年3月开始再次调控。
In August 2003, the State Council explicitly regarded the real estate sector as the mainstay of the national economy, and the "rescue" policy subsequently triggered overheating of the housing market, which began to be regulated again in March 2004.
他们由此推导，为应对2020年经济下行压力，二季度开始预计新一轮政策措施，将刺激交易量回升。
In response to the downward pressure on the economy in 2020, they deduced that a new round of policy measures was expected in the second quarter that would stimulate a rebound in trading volume.
业内甚至有一些比较乐观的看法是——疫情之下经济下行压力加大，政府可能会出台一些“救市”政策，比如放松之前严格的土拍政策、取消限购、降息等。
There is even some optimism in the industry that the economic downturn will intensify in the face of the epidemic, with the government likely to enact "bail-outs," such as loosening previous tight filming policies, lifting restrictions and cutting interest rates.
总之希图借助楼市刺激经济。
In short hope to use the housing market to stimulate the economy.
但笔者认为，这只是一些人出于自身利益的“希望”。
But I think this is just some people out of self-interest "hope."
因为今年楼市最大的变量不在楼市本身。
Because the biggest variable in the housing market this year is not the property market itself.
笔者虽然没有经历过2003年的楼市，但根据这些年的从业经验，认为2020年和2003年还是有很大的不一样：开发阶段不一样：2003年，正处于中国城市化的上升阶段，拥有大量的进城落户需求；2020年，中国城市化已经处在下半场，进城落户的动力明显不足了。
Although the author did not experience the housing market in 2003, but based on the experience of these years, I think 2020 and 2003 are very different: the stage of development is different: in 2003, China was in the rising stage of urbanization, with a large number of urban demand; in 2020, China is already in the second half of the city, the incentive to settle into the city is clearly insufficient.
杠杆水平不一样：2003年，没有大批量的高周转开发商，普遍杠杆率较低；2020年，一二线城市基本都是高周转企业，停工停业，又没有了往年节后的“小阳春”，将面临很大的资金压力。
Leveraging is not the same: in 2003, there were no large numbers of high-turnover developers, and leverage was generally low; in 2020, first and second-tier cities were largely high-turnover enterprises, shut down and no longer have the "little Yangchun" of previous festivals, which put them under considerable financial pressure.
传播媒介不一样：2003年，售楼处只能“坐”销，报纸上打广告；现在线上看房、线上售楼处兴起，足不出户也能看房，但在短期内还是无法缓解销售压力。
The media are different: in 2003, sales offices could only "sit" and advertise in newspapers; now the rise of online showrooms and online sales offices has made it possible to see houses without leaving their homes, but in the short term it is not possible to relieve the pressure on sales.
更重要的是，2003年和2020年相比，中国的经济体量、结构，以及国内外政治经济形势等都发生了极大改变。
More important, the size and structure of China's economy, as well as its political and economic situation at home and abroad, have changed dramatically between 2003 and 2020.
即便在非典期间，2003年仍保持着10%的增长。
Even during the SARS period, growth stood at 10 per cent in 2003.
但2020年，根据任泽平团队的预测，即便最乐观预计，全年增速也就在5.4%。
But in 2020, according to Ren's team, even the most optimistic forecast is 5.4% growth for the full year.
2003年的产业结构还是“二产”为主，多是大型工厂、大型地方“国企”，说白了停工停业，部分可以靠政府买单托底。
In 2003, the industrial structure was still dominated by "secondary production," mostly large factories and large local "state-owned enterprises."
但到了现在“三产”主导的2020年，影响最大的则是服务业，多数是民企、小微企业，没有人托底支持。
But by 2020, when "three-way production" dominates, the services sector will have the most impact, mostly in the form of private enterprises, micro and small businesses, with no backstop.
所以影响楼市最大的因素，是经济大环境。
So the biggest factor affecting the housing market is the general economic environment.
西贝董事长说“贷款发工资只能撑3月”；“外婆家”则称“持续停业，也只能支付2个月”；更有北京“K歌之王”与全体员工解除劳务合同。
Sebastian said the loan would only be paid for three months. Grandmothers house said it would last for two months, while Beijing's King of Kongers broke labor contracts with all its employees.
这些餐饮、休闲场所即便开业，因疫情余震，也很难马上恢复以往的销售水平。
These restaurants, leisure places even if opened, because of the aftershocks, it is difficult to immediately restore the previous level of sales.
这对原本就成本高企、人力密集型的服务业而言，无疑雪上加霜。
This adds to the already high cost and labour-intensive services sector.
疫情阴霾笼罩下，今年财富缩水甚至降薪失业，将是2020年大家面临的大概率危机。
With the spectre of an epidemic looming, this year's wealth loss, or even wage unemployment, will be the big probabilistic crisis facing everyone in 2020.
2、关心楼市不如关心城市当然不排除，可能会出台一些政策，让之前过紧的调控有所松动。
2, concern about the housing market rather than concern about the city of course not exclude that some policies may be introduced, let the previous too tight control some loose.
但房地产并不能在经济大船外“独善其身”，它取决于两个外部因素：疫病的控制和经济的复苏。
But real estate cannot be left "on its own" outside the economic ship. It depends on two external factors: containment of the epidemic and economic recovery.
这两点既取决于全国大环境，又会呈现出明显的城市分化。
These two points depend on the national environment, but also will show a clear urban division.
以前楼市新闻里动辄说“城市分化”，这个“城市分化”大多是从经济、规模而言的。
Before the property market news often said "urban differentiation," this "urban divide" is mostly in terms of economy, scale.
一般指的是“一二线”和“三四线”城市的分化。
General refers to the "first and second line" and "third and fourth line" city differentiation.
但在这场疫情面前，我们也感受到了“城市分化”。
But in the face of the epidemic, we also feel the "urban divide."
这场分化和经济、规模没有必然关系，而是一座城市的管理水平。
This division is not necessarily related to economy and size, but to the management level of a city.
2017年以来，有百余座城市加入“抢人大战”，仅2019年，全国就有超30个城市陆续出台新的落户政策。
Since 2017, more than 100 cities have joined the "robbery fight," and in 2019 alone, more than 30 cities across the country have launched new settlement policies.
武汉是近年来“抢人大战”的受益者。
Wuhan has been a beneficiary of the recent "robbery war."
2018年武汉市户籍总人口883.73万人，比上年增加了30.08万人。
In 2018, the population of Wuhan city registered 8.833 million, 300,800 more than the previous year.
武汉的高校数量80座，全国排名第三。
Wuhan has 80 colleges and universities, ranking third in China.
2017年武汉加入抢人大战，明确表示未来5年要留住100万大学生，实施“百万大学生留汉”计划。
Wuhan joined the fight in 2017, making it clear that it will retain one million college students over the next five years and implement the Million College Student Remain Program.
2017年武汉户籍人口853.65万人，比上年增加19.8万人。
In 2017, the population registered in Wuhan was 8,536,500, an increase of 198,000 over the previous year.
2018年武汉继续优化落户政策，新建“长江科学城”“长江青年城”，筹集大学租赁房，大力引进人才。
In 2018, Wuhan will continue to optimize the settlement policy, the Yangtze River Science City "" Yangtze River Youth City, "raising funds for university rental housing, vigorously introduce talent.
但疫情之后，会不会有一些“新武汉人”孔雀东南飞，在此打上问号？在疫情中，我们也看到了 “包邮区”政府班子的有作为：比如，作为“重灾区”的浙江省，让人感受到城市的温度：疫情防控新闻发布会每天发布，始终保持高度的信息透明；杭州的口罩线上预约，有专人统一配送上门；同是“红十字”，杭州和武汉天差地别，杭州红十字哪怕一元钱也会明目公示，事无巨细甚至在主流报媒整版刊登；最让笔者感动的是温州的隔离措施，针对不会使用手机购物、买菜的老年人有专人电话对接，帮老人下单、配送。
However, after the outbreak, will there be some "new Wuhan people" peacock southeast fly, in this case, we also see the "Baozhi District" government team to feel the city's temperature: As a "disaster area," Zhejiang Province, for example, daily news conference, always highly transparent information.
看一座城市的温度，最要看它对老弱病残、弱势群体的态度。
The temperature of a city depends on its attitude towards the old, the infirm and the weak.
软实力更能体现“城市化水平”。
Soft power can better reflect the "urbanization level."
城市化水平不在于修了多少地铁、大楼，创造多少GDP，还要靠软实力，靠治理水平和管理能力。
The level of urbanization depends not on how many subways and buildings are built and how much GDP is generated, but also on soft power, governance, and management capacity.
只有在有温度有安全感的城市里，才能安居乐业、自觉自治，最大发挥自身的价值。
Only in the city with the temperature and security of the city, can live and work, self-government, maximize their own value.
3、从智慧城市到健康城市当下的中国城市，也很为难。
From smart cities to healthy cities, Chinese cities are also in a difficult situation.
要吸引人才，就要多讲好故事。
To attract talent, tell more good stories.
需要印上很多“名片”，国家中心城市、世界城市、智慧城市、宜居城市、创意城市、海绵城市、花园城市、健康城市……名目众多，让人也很难理清。
A lot of "business cards" need to be printed. The name of the central city, world city, smart city, livable city, creative city, sponge city, garden city, healthy city.
市民们往往也无法理解和自身生活的关系。
Citizens are also often unable to understand how they relate to their lives.
这些“名片”多是一些专家学者，在全球城市化的过程中提出的一些理论与研究，不同的“名片”有不同的侧重。
These "business cards" are a number of experts and scholars, in the process of global urbanization put forward some theories and research, different "business cards" have different emphasis.
以智慧城市为例，就在疫情初期的武汉两会上，《政府工作报告》提出“推动数字经济创新发展，聚焦大数据、区块链、人工智能、5G等新一代信息技术集成应用。
For example, at the Wuhan two-party conference in the early stages of the epidemic, the government's Work Report proposed "innovative development of the digital economy, focusing on big data, block chains, artificial intelligence, and a new generation of IT integration applications, such as 5G."
”要抢滩5G高地，推进智慧城市建设。
We should seize the beach at Highland 5G and promote the construction of a smart city.
2020年武汉将建成覆盖全市的5G网络并全面商用，届时3万座5G基站将遍布武汉。
Wuhan will complete the city's 5G network and become fully commercial by 2020, when 30,000 5G base stations will be spread throughout Wuhan.
但在疫情之初，人们看到的却是连调剂医疗物资都需要手写介绍信的情景。
But at the beginning of the epidemic, people saw situations in which even the transfer of medical supplies required a handwritten introduction.
在重大灾祸面前，市民们到底受到了各种智慧技术多少好处？市民这时候需要的只是一只口罩、一瓶消毒水。
In the face of a major disaster, the citizens have received a variety of wisdom technology how much benefit? All the public need is a mask, a bottle of disinfectant.
有几个城市可以像杭州那样，做到手机线上预约，专人配送上门？技术为人服务，是智慧城市的初衷。
A few cities like Hangzhou, do mobile phone online booking, delivery door-to-door? Technology for people, is the original intention of smart city.
“智慧城市”是一个动态的过程，和“健康城市”一样。
"Smart city" is a dynamic process, just like "healthy city."
“健康城市”尤其在江浙沪地区，像上海、苏州、杭州等城市是目前发展的热点，这些城市老龄化突出，健康是大问题。
Healthy cities, especially in Zhejiang and Shanghai areas, such as Shanghai, Suzhou and Hangzhou, are the hotspots of development at present.
“健康城市”也有其自身的指标体系。
"Healthy city" also has its own index system.
国家卫健委2016年公布了38个首批健康城市试点名单。
The National Board of Health published a pilot list of 38 first healthy cities in 2016.
其中就有上海（嘉定区）、苏州、杭州、无锡等城市，它们在此次抗“疫”战争中，也都体现了更高的管理水平。
Among them are Shanghai (Jiading District), Suzhou, Hangzhou, Wuxi and other cities, they also reflected the high level of management in the "epidemic" war.
湖北唯一的健康城市——宜昌，确诊人数也远低于武汉、黄冈、鄂州等城市地区。
Yichang, the only healthy city in Hubei Province, also has far fewer people diagnosed than Wuhan, Huanggang and Huizhou.
无论智慧城市还是健康城市，归根到底是以人为本。
Whether the city of wisdom or health, after all, people-oriented.
疫情之后，希望我们的城市可以更多的回归人本身、生活本身。
After the epidemic, we hope that our city can be more returnees themselves, life itself.
4、房地产产品逻辑变化疫情对房地产产生多大影响？现在不能太早下结论。
It is too early to say how much impact the epidemic has had on real estate.
但房产的产品逻辑也是需要不断修正的。
But the product logic of the house also needs constant revision.
如果此次疫情能推动一些规划、产品上的改进，也是好事。
It would also be good if the outbreak could lead to some improvements in planning and products.
在中国30年来的房地产历程中，产品逻辑一直没变过，就是李嘉诚的名言：“地段、地段、地段”。
In the past 30 years of China's real estate process, the product logic has not changed, is Li Ka-shing's famous words: "lots, lots, lots."
它是指以地段位置为中心，有人流、聚人气，因而土地升值快。
It refers to the location of the site as the center, people flow, gather popularity, therefore the land appreciation fast.
所以地价是最高的成本，若在2016、2017年这样的地价巅峰拿地，产品大概率是要减配的。
So land prices are the highest cost, and if land prices peak in 2016, 2017, the high probability of products is to be reduced.
很多改善买房的客户可能会感慨，房价越来越贵，但新房的产品却越来越差。
Many buyers of improved homes may lament that prices are getting higher and higher, but the products of new homes are getting worse.
到了城市化后半段，伴随交通网络覆盖越广、配套设施越来越多的时候，再加上本次疫情的影响，可能也会出现一定程度的“逆城市化”。
In the second half of urbanization, with more and more transportation network coverage and supporting facilities, coupled with the impact of the epidemic, may also appear a certain degree of "anti-urbanization."
这个时候，大家对环境、规划的关注度会越来越高，选房子也会回归到社区、产品本身。
At this time, people will be more and more attention to the environment, planning, the choice of houses will also return to the community, the product itself.
客户的价值序列会发生改变：从以前看地铁、配套到看绿化环境、小区密度高低；从以前看外立面、建材到看户型的通透性；从看硬件到看软件——物业服务的水平。
The customer's value chain will change: from looking at the subway, matching to greening the environment, to the density of the neighborhood; from looking at the facade, building materials, to the accessibility of the home; from looking at hardware to looking at software -- the level of property services.
看看现在小区的物业，在本次疫情中发挥着重要作用。
Look at the current residential property, in this epidemic situation plays an important role.
有没有严格隔离出入口测温、有没有天天给电梯消毒、有没有为业主扔垃圾、有没有清洁中央空调，等等。
There is no strict isolation entrance temperature measurement, there is no daily elevator disinfection, there is no garbage for owners, there is no central air conditioning cleaning, and so on.
物业服务的一小步，很可能就是家庭健康的一大步！疫情之后，楼市将继续分化，产品、服务的溢价会逐渐增高。
A small step in property services is likely to be a big step in the health of families! After the epidemic, the housing market will continue to divide, and the premium for products and services will gradually increase.
5、对大城市化的反思关于埃博拉病毒的纪实文学《血疫》一书中，这样写埃博拉病毒：埃博拉是一种古老的生命形式，几乎和地球同样古老。
Rethinking the Big Urbanization In The Bloody Epidemic, a documentary about Ebola, writing about Ebola: Ebola is an ancient form of life, almost as old as Earth.
它显得既非生又非死。
It appears to be neither alive nor dead.
病毒在繁殖时看起来是活着的，但从另外一个角度来说，它们又是死的——只是机器而已，病毒是分子大小的鲨鱼、没有思想的行动。
Viruses look alive when they reproduce, but on the other hand, they are dead again - machines, viruses are molecules-sized sharks, mindless actions.
紧凑、冷酷、理性，只考虑自己，全心全意自我复制，速度非常惊人，它的首要目标就是复制。
Compact, cold, rational, self-centered, self-replicating, incredibly fast, its primary goal is reproduction.
病毒无时无刻不在复制，这一点像不像我们今日日益扩张的人类社会？不断扩张复制的人类，被定格在高密度摩天大楼的一格一格空间内，为了所谓的经济，制造垃圾污染地球。
Like our expanding human society today, viruses reproduce all the time, expanding and duplicating humans in a grid of high-density skyscrapers, creating garbage to pollute the planet for the sake of the so-called economy.
人类有史以来成为主要生活在城市中的物种——预计2050年，全球70%的人口生活在城市。
Humans have historically been the dominant urban species - with an estimated 70 per cent of the world's population living in cities by 2050.
城市化、人口聚集、高密度建筑、高铁、互联网、气候暖湿异常、工业化养殖……在疫情面前，我们不要幻想重启键，需要暂停键，通向大城市化的车轮，滚得慢一点，稳一点。
Urbanization, population density, high-density construction, high-speed rail, Internet, climate warming and humidity abnormality, industrial farming... In the face of the epidemic, we do not fantasize about restarting the key, need to pause key, to the wheel of big urbanization, slow down a little bit, steady.
