澎湃新闻记者 辛恩波美国总统特朗普3月11日晚在白宫就新冠肺炎疫情发表全国电视讲话，宣布了包括针对欧洲国家的旅行禁令、针对企业和个人的紧急救助等在内的多项措施。
NEW YORK (Reuters) - US President Donald Trump announced a number of measures, including a travel ban on European countries and emergency aid for businesses and individuals, in a nationally televised speech on the New Crown Pneumonia epidemic at the White House on the night of March 11.
这是迄今为止特朗普首次就新冠肺炎疫情向全美发表电视讲话。
It was Trump's first televised address to the United States so far on the new crown pneumonia epidemic.
当天早些时候，世界卫生组织总干事谭德塞宣布，新冠疫情已经构成全球大流行。
Earlier in the day, World Health Organization Director-General Lindsay announced that the new crown epidemic has become a global pandemic.
目前美国新冠肺炎疫情发展快，根据美国约翰·霍普金斯大学的统计，截至发稿前，美国确诊病例已经超过1300例，分布在全美44个州。
According to Johns Hopkins University, there were more than 1,300 confirmed cases in the United States in 44 states by the time of writing.
指责欧洲人把病毒“播种”到美国在当天的讲话中，特朗普承认新冠肺炎疫情给美国和美国民众带来了“大规模和非常危险的健康威胁”，但强调“对于绝大多数美国人风险非常非常低”。
Accusing Europeans of "sowing" the virus into the United States. In his speech that day, Trump acknowledged that the New Crown Pneumonia epidemic posed "a massive and very dangerous health threat" to the US and its citizens, but stressed that "the risk to the vast majority of Americans is very low."
特朗普对其领导的美国政府所采取的抗疫措施大加夸耀，称自己调用了联邦政府和私营部门的全部力量来保护美国人民，并说美国政府对这种病毒所采取的应对措施，是“现代历史上”“最积极和全面的努力”。
Trump has trumpeted the anti-epidemic measures taken by his administration, saying that he has mobilized the full power of the federal government and the private sector to protect the American people, and that the US government's response to the virus is "the most active and comprehensive effort" in modern history.
针对欧洲国家的旅行禁令，是当天特朗普在讲话中宣布的最引人关注的一项政策。
The travel ban on European countries was one of the most notable policies announced by Trump in his speech that day.
这项政策要求，从3月13日开始，30天内禁止美国与除了英国之外的欧洲国家的旅行。
The policy calls for a 30-day ban on travel from the United States to European countries other than the United Kingdom, beginning on March 13.
特朗普在电视讲话中称，这是一项“强有力但必要的行动”，目的是为了“保护美国人民的健康和福祉”。
In a televised speech, Trump called it a "strong but necessary action" to "protect the health and well-being of the American people."
特朗普指责欧洲国家没有在疫情初期采取像美国一样的严厉措施，导致目前欧洲感染者数量远超美国，来自欧洲的旅行者把病毒“播种”到美国。
Trump has accused European countries of failing to take the same drastic measures as the US in the early stages of the epidemic, leading to a far larger number of infected people in Europe today than in the US, where travellers from Europe "sowed" the virus.
特朗普表示，对于进行了适当检查的美国人可以得到豁免。
Trump has said that Americans who have been properly screened can be exempted.
美国国土安全部稍后解释说，旅行禁令不适用于返美的美国公民及其直系亲属以及美国永久居民。
The United States Department of Homeland Security later explained that the travel ban did not apply to returning United States citizens, their immediate families and permanent residents of the United States.
特朗普在11日晚上的讲话中还称，禁令也适用于大量贸易和货物运输。
In his speech on the night of November 11, Trump also said the ban would apply to large quantities of trade and goods.
他表示，“任何从欧洲进入美国的东西都是我们所讨论的（范围）”。
"Anything that comes into the US from Europe is what we're talking about," he said.
不过，特朗普稍后在其推特上做出了相反的解释，表示旅行禁令并不包括货物。
However, Trump later explained the opposite in his tweets, saying that the travel ban did not include goods.
特朗普说，“所有国家和企业需要知道的非常重要的一点是，贸易不会受到针对欧洲的30天旅行禁令的影响。
Trump says, "The very important thing that all countries and businesses need to know is that trade will not be affected by a 30-day travel ban on Europe."
限制措施禁止人员而不是货物（往来）。
Restrictive measures prohibit people rather than goods.
”特朗普称，美国将密切关注局势发展，看看是否能够更早解除限制。
Trump said the US would closely monitor the situation to see if restrictions could be lifted sooner.
特朗普说，如果中国和韩国的疫情改善，美国可能会调整针对两国的旅行限制。
Trump says the United States may change travel restrictions on China and South Korea if the disease improves.
强调“这不是金融危机”除了针对欧洲国家的旅行禁令，特朗普当天在讲话中还宣布了几项针对国内的经济和救济措施。
Emphasizing that "this is not a financial crisis," Trump announced several economic and relief measures at home, in addition to a travel ban on European countries.
特朗普称，他已经与美国健康保险业的领导者会面，他们同意免除所有新冠病毒治疗的定额手续费，扩大对这些治疗的保险覆盖范围，防止出现“意外的医疗账单”。
Trump says he has met with leaders in the US health-insurance industry, who have agreed to waive the flat-rate fees for all new crown-virus treatments, expand coverage for these treatments, and prevent "unexpected medical bills."
特朗普提到上周他签署总额为83亿美元的抗疫紧急拨款。
Trump mentioned that last week he signed into law a $8.3 billion emergency allocation to fight the epidemic.
他说这项拨款使得美国卫生机构的测试能力迅速扩大。
He said the funding has enabled rapid expansion of the testing capacity of health facilities in the United States.
不过实际上，特朗普政府因此前只向国会申请了25亿美元拨款而被国会民主党批评，上述83亿美元是两党协商的结果。
In fact, however, the Trump administration has been criticized by congressional Democrats for requesting only $2.5 billion in funding from Congress, the $8.3 billion being the result of bipartisan negotiations.
据美国媒体报道，美国国内目前的检测能力存在很大挑战。
Current testing capabilities in the United States are challenging, according to US media reports.
为了确保受新冠肺炎疫情影响而不能工作的美国人不至于出现财务困难，特朗普表示将很快采取“前所未有”的紧急财政救济行动。
To ensure that Americans unable to work as a result of the new crown-pneumonia epidemic do not have financial difficulties, Trump has said that an "unprecedented" emergency fiscal relief action will be taken soon.
他表示，他将要求国会扩大这种救济。
He said he would ask Congress to extend the relief.
特朗普不忘吹嘘他的经济成绩，称由于他采取的经济政策，在过去三年美国经济是世界上最强大的。
Trump has not forgotten to brag about his economic performance, saying that, thanks to his economic policies, the US economy has been the most powerful in the world in the last three years.
他称赞美国银行和金融机构“资本充足，惊人的强大”。
He praised US banks and financial institutions for being "capital-rich and strikingly strong."
在特朗普发表讲话的当天，美国道琼斯指数暴跌近1500点，终结了美国股市持续时间最长的牛市。
On the day Trump spoke, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged nearly 1,500 points, ending the longest-running bull market in the US stock market.
特朗普在电视讲话中表示，“这不是金融危机，这只是暂时性的时刻。
"This is not a financial crisis, it's just a temporary moment," Trump said in a televised speech.
”尽管如此，特朗普仍决定采取措施“给美国工人、家庭和企业提供额外的支持”。
Nonetheless, Trump has decided to take steps to "provide additional support to American workers, households, and businesses."
其中包括要求美国小企业局（SBA）向受到新冠肺炎疫情影响的企业提供资本和流动性支持。
These include a request to the US Small Business Administration (SBA) to provide capital and liquidity support to companies affected by the outbreak.
特朗普表示，这项立即生效的政策将向受影响的州和地区提供低息贷款，帮助企业克服暂时的经济困难。
Trump said the immediate policy would provide low-interest loans to affected states and territories to help businesses overcome temporary economic difficulties.
为此他要求国会拨款500亿美元。
He asked Congress for $50 billion.
特朗普还表示，将利用紧急授权指示财政部推迟对某些受影响的企业和个人的征税。
Trump also said he would use emergency powers to instruct the Treasury to delay taxing certain affected businesses and individuals.
他声称，这将为企业提供额外的2000亿美元的流动性。
This, he claims, would provide companies with an additional $200bn of liquidity.
最后，特朗普呼吁国会立即削减工资税，特朗普表示“希望他们（国会）非常认真地考虑这一点。
Finally, Trump has called on Congress to cut payroll taxes immediately, and Trump has expressed "the hope that they [the Congress] will take this very seriously."
”为了抵消新冠肺炎疫情对美国经济的负面影响，特朗普3月10日提出一项经济刺激计划，计划内容之一是减少雇主和雇员为支付政府养老金和医疗保健而支付的工资税，但是这项计划遭到国会民主党人的反对。
To offset the negative impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic on the US economy, Trump unveiled an economic stimulus plan on March 10 that included a reduction in payroll taxes paid by employers and employees to pay government pensions and health care, but the plan was opposed by congressional Democrats.
