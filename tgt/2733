记者/佟晓宇 实习记者/林亦桥编辑/石爱华 宋建华志愿者送孕妇到医院口在武汉每月约有1万个新生儿诞生。
Reporter / Tong Xiaoyu intern journalist / editor of Lin Yiqiao / Shi Aihua Song volunteers send pregnant women to the hospital mouth About 10,000 newborns are born in Wuhan every month.
疫情发生后，医院妇产科的部分医护人员被抽调支援发热门诊和急诊，孕产妇们的常规检查和门诊项目受限，公立医院同期收治大量发热患者，也让孕妇面临不同程度的感染风险。
In the wake of the outbreak, part of the hospital's obstetrics and gynaecology staff was drawn in to support fever clinics and emergencies. The limited routine check-up and outpatient programmes for pregnant women and the large number of febrile patients admitted to public hospitals during the same period also exposed pregnant women to varying degrees of risk of infection.
种种防疫措施之下，迎接新生命所带来的紧张、焦虑被放大，同时孕产妇也面临出行难、产检难的实际问题。
Under various preventive measures, to meet the new life of the tension, anxiety has been magnified, and pregnant women also face difficulties in travel, childbirth and testing the practical problems.
疫情发生不久，针对孕产妇的多个志愿者团队在第一时间成立，他们由妇产科医生、心理医生、泌乳师、全职妈妈以及司机组成，成为新生儿的守护者。
In the immediate aftermath of the outbreak, teams of volunteers for women in childbirth were formed, consisting of obstetricians and gynaecologists, psychologists, lactation experts, stay-at-home mothers and drivers, who became guardians of the newborn.
每当有新生儿出生的消息传来，志愿者群内就一片欢腾，“就像心里照进一片光”，一位志愿者说。
When news of a new baby arrives, the volunteers are jubilant, "like a piece of light in their hearts," said one volunteer.
邓芸志愿者群内的咨询师多是妇产医生、泌乳师、哺乳指导等专业人员支援凌晨两点，甘肃武威妇产科医生张冬的手机微信提示音一直响。
The consultants in Deng Yun-yun group were mostly obstetricians, lactation experts and lactation consultants. Zhang Dong, an obstetrician and gynecologist in Wuwei, Gansu Province, had his cell phone message sounded all the time.
一位孕期35周4天的湖北孕妇，因为持续半小时肚子痛，在群里求助。
A pregnant woman in Hubei province, who was 35 weeks and 4 days pregnant, sought help from the group for help with abdominal pain for half an hour.
张冬询问了疼痛的频率，确认她不是临产期不规律的宫缩，可孕妇还是担心是不是出了问题。
Zhang Dong asked the frequency of pain, confirmed that she is not in labor irregular contractions, but pregnant women are still worried that something is wrong.
张冬让她注意在10分钟内是否有2-3次下腹坠疼，等待中，群里另一位孕期37周的孕妈，又发来求助。
Zhang asked her to see if she had two or three lower abdominal pains in 10 minutes, while another 37-week-old pregnant woman in the group sent in for help.
在交通管制下的湖北，由于担心深夜去医院不方便，每一次疼痛都让这些临产的妈妈焦虑难眠。
In the traffic control of Hubei, because of fear of inconvenient late night to the hospital, each time the pain makes these expectant mothers anxious to sleep.
张冬所在的“湖北孕产妇免费咨询群”由贵州遵义妇幼保健院妇产科医生韩磊创立。
Zhang Dong's "Hubei free maternal consultation group" by Guizhou Zunyi maternal and child care hospital obstetrician-gynecologist Han Lei founded.
目前志愿群中已有3000名湖北籍孕产妇。
At present, there are 3,000 Hubei women among the volunteer groups.
大年三十，韩磊给武汉的同行朋友打电话，得知朋友所在的妇产科室医生大多被抽调支援发热门诊和急诊，导致部分孕产妇的常规产检和门诊无法开展，而公立医院同期收治的大量发热患者，也让孕妇面临着不同程度的感染风险。
During the Spring Festival, Han Lei telephoned friends in Wuhan and learned that doctors in the gynecology and obstetrics departments of friends were mostly transferred to support fever clinics and emergencies, thus preventing some pregnant women from having regular check-ups and clinics, while the large number of febrile patients admitted to public hospitals exposed pregnant women to varying degrees of infection.
韩磊将这一情况发到他所在的学术交流群，号召其他地区的妇产科医生一起来帮助湖北的医生分诊，尽最大限度保证孕产妇和胎儿的安全。
Han Lei sent the information to his academic exchange group, calling on obstetricians and gynecologists from other regions to help doctors in Hubei province to ensure maximum maternal and fetal safety.
24日，产妇和医生陆续加入，咨询群迅速扩大到了12个。
On 24 July, maternity and doctors joined, and the counselling group rapidly expanded to 12.
疫情发生后，这样的咨询群不在少数，产科医生、心理医生、泌乳师、全职妈妈，他们组成各种团队，支援待产的湖北籍孕产妇。
After the outbreak of the epidemic, there are many such consultation groups, obstetricians, psychiatrists, lactation experts and stay-at-home mothers, who form teams to support expectant mothers of Hubei nationality.
妇产科医生邓芸同时也是一位国际认证的泌乳师。
Deng Yun, an obstetrician and gynaecologist, is also an internationally certified lactation specialist.
她的团队从大年三十晚上筹备，初一开始运行，现在有三个群在同时接受孕产妇的线上咨询。
Her team has been preparing for the New Year's Eve and has been running since the beginning of junior high school.
邓芸的团队针对湖北省内的孕产妇，群里有四十多位志愿者，其中三十多位是资深的母乳指导，还有十几位来自各个三级医院妇产科、儿科、心理科的医生。
Deng's team targeted pregnant women in Hubei province with more than 40 volunteers, more than 30 of whom were senior breast-milk instructors, and a dozen doctors from obstetrics, gynaecology, paediatrics and psychology departments at all three levels of hospitals.
“他们都有3到5年的工作经验，有些还具有国际泌乳顾问的认证。
"They all have three to five years of work experience, some of them certified as international lactation consultants.
”跟韩磊一样，邓芸先在医疗专业群里发出倡议，很快就收到超过200人的回复，不到24小时，这只团队就组建起来了，“就像一场迫切的自救活动”。
Like Han Lei, Deng Yun first launched an initiative among medical professionals and soon received more than 200 responses. Within 24 hours, the team was organized, "like an urgent self-help campaign."
即便顺利生产，在哺乳期也会遇到各种问题。
Even if the birth is successful, problems will be encountered during lactation.
邓芸说，“比如新生儿出现鼻塞，妈妈就很担心，会一直询问要不要去医院，其实这个孩子通过线上医生的指导和干预就可以处理，不需要去医院冒风险。
"For example, if a newborn has a stuffy nose, her mother will always ask if she wants to go to the hospital," Deng said.
”群里有一个待产妈妈是疑似感染病例，曾住院隔离。
A expectant mother in the group was suspected to have contracted the infection and was hospitalized in isolation.
邓芸介绍，“她不知道该怎样去分娩，选择什么样的医院，现在很多医院产科处于停摆状态，我们就去帮她沟通定点的医疗机构，联系床位。
"She did not know how to give birth, what kind of hospital to choose," Deng said. "Now that many hospital obstetrics departments are at a standstill, we will help her communicate with the designated medical institutions and contact her bed.
”从早8点到晚6点，每天三个志愿者在三个群里同时值班，处理各种问题和咨询。
From 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., three volunteers a day worked in three groups, working on a variety of issues and counselling.
目前，这个团队的受益人数已超过1000人。
So far, the team has benefited more than 1,000 people.
邓芸在群中收到的感谢卡陪聊支持不仅是身体上的，还有心理上的。
The thank-you cards Deng Yun received in the group were not only physical but also psychological.
产后两周，是产后抑郁症的高发期。
Postnatal two weeks, postpartum depression is the high incidence period.
很多新手妈妈，对未知的东西感到迷茫，不知道怎样去带孩子，很多孕妇晚上会失眠，疫情将她们的焦虑感成倍放大。
Many novice moms, confused about the unknown, don't know how to take care of their children, and many pregnant women suffer sleeplessness at night, which doubles their anxiety.
吴雪娟在2月6日加入了“宝宝守护计划”，群里的志愿者来自各行各业，他们关注孕产妇身体健康的同时，也注重对她们情绪的疏导。
Wu joined the Guardian of Babies on February 6, bringing together volunteers from all walks of life to focus on maternal health and emotional well-being.
志愿者郭迪晴记得，第一天晚上就有一百多位咨询者进群，“多是38、39周的临产孕妇，每个人都有不同的需求。
Volunteer Guo Deqing remembers that on the first night more than a hundred counsellors came to the group, "mostly expectant mothers aged 38 or 39 weeks, each with different needs.
”吴雪娟和郭迪晴都没想到，这个群体会这么庞大，“几乎每天都会增加十几个人，到现在群里已有近300人。
Wu Xuejuan and Guo did not expect that this group would be so large, "almost a dozen people a day, by now nearly 300 people in the group.
”全职妈妈吴雪娟有过三次生产经历，最小的孩子五岁。
Wu Xuejuan, a stay-at-home mom, has given birth three times, with the youngest child five years old.
她开玩笑说自己的志愿工作就是“陪聊”，“非常时期，无法按时产检或其他情况都让妈妈们更焦虑，她们总会担心，我的宝宝出现了状况怎么办？”除了照顾最小的孩子，吴雪娟把剩下来的时间几乎都用来回答孕产妇的问题，“这个时候不得不一直待在家里，她们更需要的是一个倾诉出口。
She joked that her volunteer work was "talking with her," that "untimely check-ups and other conditions make mothers more anxious, and they always worry about what's wrong with my baby?" Wu spent almost the rest of her time answering maternal questions.
”“宝宝守护计划”的志愿者们一对一匹配孕产妇，分成七个小组，各自有对接的群。
Volunteers from the Guardian of Babies program matched mothers one to one, split into seven groups with docking groups.
除了对接孕产妇，作为小组长，郭迪晴还要负责组内的人员分配、问题汇总和反馈。
In addition to docking pregnant women, as a group leader, Guo is also responsible for the distribution of personnel within the group, the summary of issues and feedback.
“最主要是解决她们的焦虑，一方面害怕外面有病毒，一方面不知到底能不能顺利到医院生产。
"The most important thing is to address their anxiety, on the one hand fear of the virus outside, on the one hand, do not know whether they can smoothly into hospital delivery.
”每天早上，郭迪晴都会给自己对接的孕妇发信息，询问她们的状态和情绪。
Every morning, Guo sends messages to expectant mothers about their docking and asks them about their status and emotions.
她会认真倾听她们的生活琐事，有些孕妇在家里无聊，郭迪晴就把她们拉到读书会群，“让她们有事情做”。
She listens attentively to the details of their lives. Some pregnant women are bored at home, and Guo draws them to study groups, "Let them have something to do."
大家集思广益，形成了自己的书单，育儿、心理方面的都有，最近有人推荐《亲爱的安德烈》、《陪一颗心长大》。
They brainstormed and formed their own lists of books on parenting, psychology and, more recently, "Dear Andrey" and "Growing Up with a Heart."
郭迪晴的专业是心理学，在武汉从事教育培训，现在滞留在十堰老家。
Guo Deqing major is psychology, engaged in education and training in Wuhan, is now stranded in Shiyan hometown.
有时，孕妇的求助近乎抱怨，带着强烈的负面情绪，碰到这种时候，郭迪晴会“过滤掉那些话，尽可能用自己的乐观去引导对方。
At times, when a pregnant woman comes close to complaining and has a strong negative emotion, Guo "filters out the words and guides the other person as optimistically as possible.
”志愿者谢绝产妇家属发来的红包产检志愿者们像挤海绵一样挤出自己的时间去帮助孕产妇，但工作并非一直顺利，有最初的忙乱、孕产妇的不信任，也有志愿者家人的不理解。
Volunteers who refused to give birth to a red envelope from a family member pushed aside time like a sponge to help the mother, but the work was not always smooth, with initial confusion, mistrust among mothers and a lack of understanding among family members.
邓芸和团队成员一直在寻找和孕产妇更好的连结方式，定期研讨群里遇到的各种案例和问题，“我们也希望志愿者在复盘时放开自己的情绪，这样才能有更好的状态去服务。
Deng Yun and the team members have been looking for better ways to link up with the pregnant women, regularly discussing the various cases and problems encountered in the group. "We also hope that volunteers can release their emotions when returning to the discs so that they can better serve.
”张冬1月23号加入了第一个孕产妇免费咨询群。
Zhang Dong joined the first group of free maternity consultations on January 23.
1月27日她从深圳返回甘肃，社区要求她和丈夫居家隔离14天。
She returned to Gansu on January 27 from Shenzhen, where she was ordered to remain in isolation from her husband for 14 days.

丈夫看后，转头对张冬说，“你做的事挺有意义的。
When the husband looked at it, he turned to Zhang Dong and said, "What you did makes sense.
”此后，丈夫承担了家里的全部家务，让张冬有更多时间为临产产妇服务。
Since then, her husband has taken on all the household chores, giving Zhang more time to attend to childbirth.
众多咨询内容里，关于产检的问题特别多。
Among the many consultation contents, there are many questions about prenatal check-up.
“孕妇最担心不能按时产检，这样会增加孕产妇和新生儿的死亡率。
"Pregnant women are most concerned about not being tested regularly, which increases maternal and neonatal mortality.
例如，孕妇在第12周要做NT，筛查新生儿畸形，过了这个时间就做不了了。
For example, pregnant women are screened for birth abnormalities during the 12th week after which they are unable to do so.
我们就叮嘱待产妈妈，不论怎样，都要想办法在这个时间里做一次B超，这是底线”，韩磊说。
We told expectant mothers to stay in labor, however, to find a way to do a B-ultrasound at this time, that's the bottom line, "said Han Lei.

当时，张扬还有一个月到预产期，但她无法如期进行产检。

By 6: 00 p. m., Zhang Yang had finished all the examinations for a Caesarean section. "The wait during the outbreak seemed particularly long and intense.
”生产后，张扬在群里详细地讲了医院里的状况，之前大家最担忧的就是去了医院后怎么办？张扬带回的信息，让很多焦虑的妈妈情绪稳定下来。
"After the birth, Zhang Yang detailed the situation in the hospital in the group, and what was the main concern before all was what to do when they went to the hospitalThe message Zhang brought back stabilized many anxious mothers.
张扬把这个群看成自己的“组织”，“你会觉得自己不是单打独斗，不是只有你一个人在经历这些特殊的情况。
Zhang Yang regards the group as his own "organization," "You feel you're not alone, you're not the only one who's going through these special situations.
”并非所有人都能像张扬这样顺利地从家里到达医院。
Not everyone gets to the hospital as smoothly as Zhang Yang does.
入夜后，孕产妇发送的信息常牵动着“W大武汉紧急救援小组”的另外一群志愿者们。
Late at night, the women often send messages to a group of volunteers with the "W Wuhan Emergency Rescue Team."
群里有一支4人组成的车队，专门负责接送武汉的临产孕妇去医院。
The group included a four-member convoy dedicated to transporting pregnant women in labor to hospitals in Wuhan.
新生命往往不按计划到来，中间总是有各种各样的突发情况，对于出行不便的家庭，需要依赖志愿车队。
New life often does not arrive as planned, there is always a variety of contingencies, and families with limited mobility need to rely on volunteer convoys.
接送孕妇的志愿者司机只有4人，他们24小时轮岗，负责支援联盟群里220位孕期35周以上的临产妇，他们是握紧方向盘随时准备赛跑的人。
There were only four volunteer drivers to transport pregnant women on 24-hour shifts to support 220 expectant mothers over 35 weeks of pregnancy in the Alliance who were holding the steering wheel ready for a race.
为了最快地将临产妈妈送到医院，志愿者王紫懿睡觉从不脱衣服。

为保证孕产妇的安全，送产司机还用各种办法给自己的车“升级改造”。
To ensure maternal safety, delivery drivers also use a variety of ways to "upgrade" their cars.
王震用纸板、透明胶为车分出了前后隔离区，每次出车回家，他用消毒水喷洒全车内外，担心气味大让孕产妇不适，他还会在路边通风15~20分钟。
