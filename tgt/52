“我的酒店当时空着，我就想，拿出来给医护人员住，想法很简单。
"My hotel was empty and I thought it would be a simple idea to bring it out to the paramedics.
”全文2514字，阅读约需5分钟为给奋斗在抗击疫情一线的医护人员提供免费和方便的住宿，除夕夜（1月24日），数百位武汉酒店业内人士自发组建武汉医护酒店支援联盟。
Reading the full text takes about five minutes to provide free and convenient accommodation for medical staff struggling to combat the epidemic. On New Year's Eve (January 24), hundreds of Wuhan hotel insiders spontaneously formed the Wuhan Healthcare Hotels Support League.
截至1月30日21点，联盟合计为6056位医护人员提供超4万个间夜的住宿。
As at 2100 hours on 30 January, the Union had provided more than 40,000 overnight accommodations for 6,056 health-care workers.
昨日（1月31日），联盟发布公告称，自1月31日起，武汉地区159家单体酒店、民宿、公寓和小型连锁酒店将不再接待医护人员和客人。
Yesterday, Jan. 31, the league said in a statement that since January 31, 159 individual hotels, residential homes, apartments and small hotel chains in Wuhan will no longer receive medical staff and guests.
其他112家连锁酒店中，除50家已经满房的酒店外，其余62家酒店将继续为医护人员提供住宿服务。
Of the other 112 hotel chains, 62 will continue to provide accommodation for medical staff, in addition to the 50 already full hotels.
就此，新京报记者对话联盟第一发起人、酒店业主肖雅星，发起人之一、环球旅讯创始人李超以及参与联盟的酒店业主白羽（化名）。
In this regard, the first founder of the Beijing News Correspondents Dialogue Alliance, hotel owner Xiao Yaxing, one of the sponsors, Universal Travel founder Li Chao, and the hotel owner Bai Yu (alias) who participated in the association.
据悉，联盟停止部分酒店接待，主要因缺乏急需的物资和资金资源，多数酒店工作人员已经极度疲惫，酒店的物资和卫生状况亦达到极限。
It is reported that the Union stopped some hotel reception, mainly due to the lack of much-needed material and financial resources, most hotel staff has been extremely tired, the hotel material and sanitary conditions have reached the limit.
此后各家酒店计划继续接待医护人员，可自行对接相关医院。
Since then, hotels plan to continue to receive medical personnel, can dock the relevant hospitals.

受访者供图━━━━━肖雅星：联盟停止部分接待后 酒店、医院可自行对接新京报：最初为何发起联盟支援？肖雅星：当时觉得医护人员太辛苦，很多住得远，交通又不方便，一般的酒店可能担心风险不让他们入住，还有很多酒店又处于停业状态。
2007-9-24 16: 53 The Union Stopped Part of the Reception Hotel and Hospital Can Dock The Beijing News: Why did the Alliance Support First? Xiao Yaxing: At the time, health care workers were working too hard, many lived far away, and transportation was inconvenient.
我的酒店当时空着，我就想，拿出来给医护人员住，想法很简单。
My hotel was empty, and I thought it would be a simple idea to bring it out to the paramedics.
新京报：为何停止部分酒店接待工作，遇到了什么困难？肖雅星：缺乏物资和资金，政府没有物资支持，消毒工作也面临困难，目前主要是酒店员工或者医护人员自己消毒。
What difficulties have you encountered in stopping some hotel receptions? Xiao Yaxing: Lack of material and financial resources, lack of material support from the government, and difficulties in disinfection.
部分酒店每天开支不小，都要自行承担，有些承受不来，加上可能员工还不太理解。
Some hotels spend a lot every day, have to bear their own, some can not bear, and may not be well understood by the staff.
我们大概评估了一下，即使停止部分单体酒店、小型连锁酒店等接待工作，应该也能满足目前需求。
We have probably assessed that even if we stop some single hotels, small hotel chains and other reception work, should also be able to meet the current demand.
新京报：目前还在继续接待的酒店，物资如何保证？肖雅星：我们收到了很多爱心企业的捐赠，剩下的大型连锁等酒店我们会继续给予物资支持，包括口罩、防护服、体测仪、消毒水等。
We have received donations from many loving enterprises, and we will continue to provide material support to the remaining major hotel chains, including masks, protective clothing, body detectors, disinfectant water, etc.
目前200套防护服还剩58套，第二批1.2万个口罩还有3000个。
There are 58 remaining 200 suits and another 3,000 for the second 12, 000.
消毒水目前是足量供应。
Disinfectant water is now available in sufficient quantities.
我们不考虑再次募捐了，物资用完了可能会完全停止联盟。
We're not considering another fundraiser. If we run out of supplies, we might stop the alliance altogether.
新京报：联盟停止后，如何解决医护人员住宿问题？肖雅星：即使联盟停止，酒店也可以继续接待医护人员，他们可以自行对接，只是不通过联盟了。
The Beijing News: What will happen when the alliance stops? Xiao Yaxing: Even if the alliance stops, the hotel can continue to receive medical staff, they can dock on their own, but not through the alliance.
不过要提醒他们，一定要注意做好消毒工作。
However, to remind them to do a good job of disinfection.
另外，我们连锁酒店依然在接待，后面陆续还有物资到，会优先给连锁酒店分发，我们对医护人员的接待工作会更好。
In addition, our hotel chain is still in the reception, after the arrival of supplies, will give priority to distribution to hotel chains, we will better medical staff reception.
我们还募捐到了旅行睡袋、体测仪，等火神山、雷神山医院建好后，我们可以代为捐赠给他们。
We also raised money to travel sleeping bags, body detector, and so on fire god mountain, Lei Shenshan hospital was built, we can donate to them on their behalf.
新京报：大家如何评价你们的行为？肖雅星：我不想用最坏的恶意来揣测人心，确实有一些让我们寒心的言论，但是极少部分，大部分是不错的。
The Beijing News: What do you think of your behavior? Xiao Yaxing: I don't want to speculate with the worst possible malice.
我想对联盟的参与者说，大家都很棒，有的酒店因为地理位置、交通等原因，加入后还没接待过医护人员，他们自己也很着急，特别想贡献力量。
I would like to tell the league participants that everyone is great. Some hotels, because of their geographical location, transportation and other reasons, haven't received medical staff since they joined.
我觉得，只要加入就是提供了爱心，我们是值得被大家记住的集体。
I feel that as long as you join us, you provide love and we are worthy of being remembered collectively.
李超：我想帮点忙 仅此而已新京报：为什么要发起支援联盟？李超：我想帮点忙，仅此而已。
Li Chao: I'd like to help you. That's all the new Beijing News: Why do you want to launch a support alliance? Li Chao: I want to help you, that's all.
新京报：这份停止部分酒店接待工作的通告是你起草的，那时候是什么心情？李超：昨晚熬夜写的，今晨看到世卫组织的公告，有些百感交集。
Li Chao: Did you stay up late last night to see the announcement of the WHO this morning? It was a mixed blessing.
过去7天，我的心情就像坐过山车一样跌宕起伏，有过焦虑、担忧，也有过亢奋、欢笑。
For the past seven days, my mood has been like a roller coaster ride, with its ups and downs, anxiety, anxiety, excitement and laughter.
我们一群人干了一件良心事，收获了这么多支持和赞扬，内心还是无比欣慰。
We a group of people have done a conscientious thing, harvest so much support and praise, the heart is still very relieved.
新京报：停止部分酒店接待，主要出于什么考虑？李超：原因很简单，就是熬不住了。
Beijing News: What are the main reasons for stopping the reception of some hotels? Li Chao: The reason is simple, just can't stand it.
联盟开始运作以来，众多酒店业主投入了不菲的人力和资金，估算的水电费和布草等消耗超过250万元，这还不包括房租和人力成本。
Since the Alliance's inception, numerous hotel owners have invested considerable human and financial resources in the estimated consumption of over $2.5 million in utilities and cloths, not including rent and manpower costs.
但由于缺乏急需的物资和资金资源，联盟为参与酒店提供的支持非常有限，多数酒店工作人员已经极度疲惫，酒店的物资和卫生状况亦达到极限，这使得酒店的运营和服务处于极大风险。
However, owing to the lack of much-needed material and financial resources, the Alliance provided very limited support for participation in the hotels, most of whose staff were already extremely exhausted and the hotel was stretched to the limit in terms of material and sanitary conditions, putting the operation and services of the hotel at great risk.
新京报：联盟下一步有何打算？李超：当务之急是消毒。
Beijing News: What's the next step for the league? Li Chao: Disinfection is the top priority.
在征得酒店业主同意的情况下，联盟将统一安排上述159家酒店的消毒工作，相关费用由联盟负责筹集。
With the consent of the hotel owners, the Alliance will arrange for the disinfection of the 159 hotels in question, the cost of which will be covered by the Union.
其他112家连锁酒店，除50家已经满房的酒店外，其余62家酒店将继续为医护人员提供住宿服务。
The remaining 112 hotel chains, in addition to the 50 already full, will continue to provide accommodation for medical staff.
我们还在考虑，如何为加入的这些酒店拓宽推广渠道。
We are also considering how to expand the distribution channels for these hotels.

Volunteers deliver a collection of air purifiers to the Union Hotel.
受访者供图━━━━━白羽：停止接待 我于心不忍新京报：当初为什么要参与联盟支援？白羽：我当时看到很多医护人员没地方住，他们很着急、很疲惫，有的不知所措地来问我们，我心肠软，没办法拒绝。
/ [^ # 39 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 116] / n. The Beijing News: Why did you take part in coalition support in the first placeWhite Yu: I saw a lot of medical workers have no place to live.
新京报：你的酒店还在接待医护工作者吗？白羽：是的。
Is your hotel still serving medical workers? Baiyu: Yes.
除夕当晚我加入了联盟的联络群，我们两个店启动接待工作，大年初一至今，35间房一共接待了51位医护工作者，目前仍在继续接待。
On New Year's Eve, I joined the League's network of contacts. Our two stores started reception. Since New Year's Day, 35 rooms have received 51 medical workers and continue to receive them.
新京报：酒店每天怎么消毒？白羽：我们对接的每个医院的医护人员都有入住群，入住前，我会提前跟他们说，消毒工作要医护人员自己做，因为他们是专业的。
Before check-in, I will tell them in advance that the disinfection should be done by the medical staff themselves, because they are professional.
他们需要自备四件套、洗漱用品、垃圾袋，白天离店时，要把垃圾袋封好，带走处理。
They need to bring their own four-piece sets, toiletries and garbage bags. When they leave the store during the day, they should seal the bags and take them away for disposal.
因为我们是密码锁，医护人员自助入住。
Because we are password-locked, paramedics are self-occupied.
酒店整栋楼的公共区域消毒是我自己做的，用稀释的84消毒液，大年初三把电梯间、开关、门把手等全部喷洒消毒，明天还要再消毒一次。
The disinfection of the public area of the whole building was done by myself. I sprayed the elevator, switch and doorknob with the diluted 84 disinfectant on the third day of the year.
新京报：每天的成本大概有多少？白羽：我们是商务楼宇，用商务水电，一间房一天成本在20块左右，还有租金成本。
How much is the daily cost? We are a commercial building, using commercial hydropower, the cost of a room is around 20 yuan a day, and the rental cost.
新京报：下一步要是成本承受不起，怎么办？白羽：接下来我们会看实际情况，如果武汉交通基本恢复、大家回家比较方便，我会跟医护人员沟通。
What will you do next if the cost is unbearable? We will see the actual situation next, if Wuhan transportation is basically restored and it is convenient for us to go home, I will communicate with the medical staff.
成本这块，首先我们会跟房东沟通租金能否减免，跟员工沟通薪水调整。
First of all, we will communicate with the landlord if the rent can be waived, and with employees to communicate salary adjustments.
另外我们也会跟医护人员沟通一下，能否象征性地收取一些水电费，比如每天10元。
In addition, we will also communicate with the medical staff, whether the symbolic charge for some water and electricity, such as 10 yuan a day.
新京报：联盟今天停止部分酒店接待工作，你想过要停止吗？白羽：我于心不忍，我如果突然不接待也有些不妥，医护人员临时可能找不到能住的地方。
Do you ever think of stopping the reception of some of the hotels in the league today.White feather: I can't bear it, if I don't accept them suddenly, the medical staff may not be able to find a place to stay for a while.
新京报：这些天参与下来，什么感受？白羽：想法很简单，我手里有几十间房可以暂时解决医护人员住宿难，我也没有太多能力去组织、募捐物资等等，我把手头的事情做好就好，力所能及。
I have dozens of rooms in my hand that can provide temporary accommodation for medical staff, and I don't have much ability to organize, collect donations, etc. I wish I could do what I can.
