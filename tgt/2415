柯溢能 / 微信公众号“浙江大学”新冠病毒除了呼吸道传播以外，是否还有其他途径，这一直是科研人员关心的热点问题。
Whether the new crown virus of Kospi / Weixin Public "Zhejiang University" other than respiratory tract transmission, has been a hot topic concerned by researchers.
2月26日，浙江大学医学院附属第一院副院长、眼科学科带头人沈晔教授团队，在《医学病毒学杂志》（Journal of Medical Virology）在线发表了一项研究工作，揭示在研究的新冠肺炎患者样本中，存在一名结膜炎患者的眼泪和结膜分泌物样本，在核酸检测中出现病毒阳性结果。
On February 26, a team of professors Shen Ye, vice-dean of the first hospital attached to the Zhejiang University School of Medicine and head of ophthalmology, published an online study that revealed the presence of tear and conjunctivitis samples of a patient with conjunctivitis with positive nucleic acid test results in a patient with new crown pneumonia.
该研究第一作者为夏建华，共同通讯作者为沈晔、郭东煜。
The first author of the study was Xia Jianhua, the co-authors were Ye Shen and Yu Guo.
论文第一单位为浙江大学医学院附属第一医院。
The first unit is Zhejiang University Medical School attached to the first hospital.
沈晔介绍，研究不同的传播方式，对于把握新冠病毒传染规律，改进疾病治疗方法和防控措施具有重要意义。
The study of different ways of spreading was very important to grasp the regularity of new crown virus infection and improve the methods of disease treatment and control measures.
浙大科研人员从1月26日至2月9日在浙江大学医学院附属第一医院确诊的30例新冠肺炎患者，对他们的泪液和结膜分泌物混合物开展研究。
From January 26 to February 9, Zhejiang University researchers studied a mixture of lacrimal and conjunctival secretions in 30 patients diagnosed with Newly Coronary Pneumonia, a hospital attached to Zhejiang University School of Medicine.
在第一阶段6例样本研究中，均未发现核酸检测病毒阳性。
None of the first six samples tested positive for nucleic acid.
团队果断认为，已有样本并不具有代表性与全面性，为此需要延长观察周期，继续留在隔离病房开展采样与研究。
The team decided that the available samples were not representative and comprehensive and therefore needed to extend the observation cycle and remain in the isolation ward for sampling and research.
研究团队在一位新冠肺炎患者身上发现，该病人左眼具有结膜炎症，即新冠引起的红眼病，而右眼没有此症状。
The team found conjunctivitis in the left eye, or red eye disease in the new crown, but not in the right eye, in a patient with new crown pneumonia.
而在此前的了解中，该患者入院前无结膜炎。
Prior to admission, the patient had no conjunctivitis.
本次研究中的其他患者样品核酸检测均为阴性。
Nucleic acid tests were negative in all other patients in this study.
研究样本“这位患者眼部的差异性非常具有代表性，在征得同意后，我们就研究结膜炎症是否与病毒具有联系。
Study sample "This patient's eye difference is very representative, and with consent, we looked at whether conjunctivitis was associated with the virus.
”通过核酸检测，浙大研究人员发现患有结膜炎的左眼新冠病毒检测为阳性，而右眼则是阴性。
After DNA testing, Zhejiang University researchers found positive for the new crown virus in the left eye and negative in the right eye.
为确保研究准确性，对两只眼睛的结膜分泌物做了三次核酸检查，结果均一致。
To ensure the accuracy of the study, three nucleic acid tests were performed on conjunctival secretions of both eyes, with consistent results.
目前该患者通过抗病毒综合治疗，整体治愈的情况下，结膜炎症也转好，再次检测眼部病毒转阴。
At present, the patient through antiviral comprehensive treatment, a holistic cure, conjunctivitis also improved, re-examination of the eye virus Yin.
对于患者是如何因新冠病毒发生眼部结膜炎症的，科研人员表示仍在持续研究。
Researchers say there is continuing research into how patients develop conjunctivitis due to the new crown virus.
沈晔介绍，通过这项研究可以得出以下结论：1、患者左眼结膜炎与新冠病毒有关；2、存在眼部传染新冠病毒的风险；3、呼吸道可能不是新冠病毒传播的唯一途径。
According to the study, the following conclusions can be drawn: 1. The patient's left eye conjunctivitis is associated with the new crown virus; 2. There is a risk of eye infection with the new crown virus; 3. Respiratory tract may not be the only way to spread the new crown virus.
沈晔表示，这项研究的现实意义在于提示医务人员在检查可疑病例时，除了佩戴口罩外，还需要佩戴护目镜。
ShenYe said the practical significance of the study was to remind medical staff to wear goggles in addition to masks when examining suspicious cases.
该研究为国家新冠病毒防控相关指南和标准的进一步完善提供科学依据。
This study provides scientific basis for the further improvement of national guidelines and standards for the prevention and control of the new crown virus.
“结膜就是我们通常所说的眼白的最外层，是眼睛与空气接触的隔离物，氧气可以在结膜吸收，参与代谢的屏障功能，其功能正常可以阻断细菌、病毒等病原体的侵入。
"The conjunctiva, or conjunctiva, is what we call the outermost layer of whiteness. It is a barrier between the eyes and the air. Oxygen can be absorbed in the conjunctiva and participate in the metabolic barrier function.
”沈晔介绍，新冠病毒是否能找到人体免疫漏洞进入人体还有待于进一步研究，期待通过合作解开谜题。
ShenYe said further research was needed to determine whether the new leaf could find human immunodeficiency virus into the body, hoping to solve the mystery through cooperation.
该研究得到浙江省科技厅重大科技项目支持。
The research was supported by a major technology project of Zhejiang Science and Technology Bureau.
