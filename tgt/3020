澎湃新闻记者 胡甄卿近日，美国与希腊等多国出现了邮轮乘客确诊新冠肺炎或曾与新冠肺炎患者接触的情况，不禁令人担心事态发展或如早前在日本横滨港暴发严重疫情的“钻石公主”号邮轮那样。
The recent emergence of a new crown pneumonia or previous contact with the New Crown Pneumonia by cruise passengers in the United States and Greece is a cause for concern, as is the case with the earlier outbreak of a serious outbreak of the Princess Diamond at Yokohama, Japan.
据美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）3月6日报道，一艘名为“至尊公主”号的邮轮目前正停泊在美国加利福尼亚州旧金山的海边，该船乘客与工作人员正在接受新冠肺炎检测。
A passenger and crew of the USS Princess Supreme are being tested for pneumonia on the beach in San Francisco, Calif., the country's top passenger and crew, CNN reported Wednesday.
这些测试包是由一架美国加州空军国民警卫队直升机送上船的，美国疾病控制中心的医务人员也来到“至尊公主”号邮轮上对乘客进行新冠肺炎检测。
The test kits were flown on board a California Air Force National Guard helicopter, and U.S. Centers for Disease Control medical staff arrived aboard the MV Supreme Princess to test passengers for pneumonia.
据CNN 7日报道，美国副总统彭斯周五（6日）称，“至尊公主号”邮轮上已有21人新冠病毒检测呈阳性。
US Vice President Burns said Friday that 21 people had been tested positive for the virus on board the MV Supreme Princess.
“至尊公主”号的运营方英国嘉年华集团发表声明称，包括乘客与船上工作人员在内的近100名人员需要接受检测。
Nearly 100 people, including passengers and crew, will have to be tested, Carnival, the British carnival operator, said in a statement.
CNN刊文指出，截至5日，已有45人接受了检测。
As of May 5, 45 people had been tested, CNN reported.
目前船上共有2422名乘客与1111名工作人员，他们分别来自54个国家。
There are currently 2,422 passengers and 1,111 staff members from 54 countries on board.
早前在日本横滨港暴发严重疫情的“钻石公主”号邮轮，也由英国嘉年华集团运营。
Earlier in Yokohama, Japan, a serious outbreak of the "Princess Diamond" cruise ship, also operated by the United Kingdom Carnival Group.
据法新社5日报道，当地时间4日，加利福尼亚州出现首例新冠病毒感染死亡病例，经证实，该名死者与另一名新冠肺炎确诊患者是上个月乘搭“至尊公主”号邮轮时感染，该两名确诊染病游客于2月11日至21日期间搭乘“至尊公主”号从旧金山往返墨西哥，并与其他乘客从旧金山下船回家，之后两人被确诊染病，其中一人为北加州的71岁老翁，他已于4日病逝。
The first case of death from a canopy virus in California was confirmed on Feb. 11 to 21 when the first human case of Crested Pneumonia was confirmed on board the USS Princess Supreme between February 11 and 21, and was taken home from San Francisco with other passengers, including a 71-year-old man from Northern California who died of the disease on Feb.
在他病逝后，“至尊公主”号取消了原定前往夏威夷的航程。
After his death, the Supreme Princess canceled her scheduled voyage to Hawaii.
法新社刊文指出，加利福尼亚州州长纽森已下令“至尊公主”号5日清晨返抵旧金山时不得靠岸，直至当局对船上所有人员完成检疫为止。
Newson, California's governor, has ordered the Princess Supreme to stay ashore when she returns to San Francisco in the early hours of the morning, until quarantine is completed for all on board, AFP reported.
“联邦疾控中心、加州公共卫生局与美国海岸警卫队正展开合作，确认何时可以允许‘至尊公主’号靠岸，并研究如何将乘客送回家。
The CDC, the California Department of Public Health and the U.S. Coast Guard are working together to determine when the Supreme Princess can be allowed to dock and how to get passengers home.
”纽森说，“船上乘客来自美国各地，其中一半来自加州。
"Passengers came from all over the United States, half of them from California," he said.
”与此同时，据希腊《每日新闻报》（I Kathimerini）6日消息，目前正在希腊海域内的“歌剧”号邮轮有一名已下船多日的乘客确诊感染新冠病毒，该男子为奥地利公民，曾在该邮轮上停留约两周时间，并于2月28日在意大利下船，随后返回奥地利。
Meanwhile, the Greek daily newspaper I Kathimerini reported Tuesday that a disembarking passenger, an Austrian citizen who had spent about two weeks on board the vessel, disembarked in Italy on February 28 and then returned to Austria, was confirmed to be infected with the New Crown virus by a passenger off board the Greek vessel Opera.
当奥地利方面3月4日通知该邮轮有奥地利男子感染新冠病毒时，“歌剧”号邮轮正停靠在雅典比雷埃夫斯港，出于安全考虑，“歌剧”号邮轮要求当时在比雷埃夫斯港上岸的所有乘客尽快返回船上。
When Austria notified the vessel on March 4 that an Austrian man had been infected with the new crown virus, the ship Opera was docking at the Athens port of Piraeus. For safety reasons, the vessel asked all passengers who had disembarked at Piraeus to return as soon as possible.
不过，乘客已被告知这名新冠病毒感染者已经不在船上多日。
However, passengers have been informed that the new crown virus infected person has not been on board the ship for many days.
《每日新闻报》报道称，“歌剧”号邮轮已于5日抵达其最终目的地希腊科孚岛，希腊卫生部门在排除该船另有新冠病毒感染者的可能性后已允许所有乘客与工作人员下船，不采取额外措施。
The Daily News reported that the ship "Opera" had reached its final destination, Corfu, Greece, on May 5 and that the Greek health authorities had allowed all passengers and staff to disembark without additional measures after ruling out the possibility of the vessel being infected with the virus.
目前，该船的1579名乘客与723名工作人员已下船。
At present, 1,579 passengers and 723 staff members of the same vessel have been disembarked.
此外，据彭博社此前消息，3日，一艘载有1200名乘客的德国邮轮Aida Aura号在挪威海于格松（Haugesund）港接受整体隔离。
In addition, according to Bloomberg News, on March 3, a German cruise ship, Aida Aura, carrying 1,200 passengers, was isolated in its entirety at the port of Haugesund in the Norwegian Sea.
此前，该邮轮上两名乘客接受了新型冠状病毒检测，因为这两位乘客在一周前曾接触过一名新冠肺炎病毒感染者，他们被立刻送往霍克兰，而其他乘客则留在船上。
The two passengers were tested for the coronavirus after being contacted a week ago by a man infected with the virus and taken to Hokrand while the other passengers remained on board.
所幸的是，两位乘客的检测结果皆为阴性，海于格松市政府派去的一名医生在查看船上情况后也强调，船上无人显示出新冠肺炎症状，该邮轮将尽快离开港口。
Fortunately, both passengers tested negative, and a doctor sent by the city government of Heyson, after examining the ship's condition, also stressed that no one on board had shown signs of new pneumonia and that the ship would leave the port as soon as possible.
