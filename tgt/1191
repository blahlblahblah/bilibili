“真的要宅疯了！”这可能是疫情暴发之后，众多宅在家里的人内心中一致的想法。
"Really crazy house!" This may be the outbreak of the outbreak, many people at home in the heart of the idea.
新型冠状病毒肺炎这只“黑天鹅”从武汉飞出来以后，迅速蔓延全国。
The new coronavirus pneumonia, the "black swan" flew out of Wuhan, quickly spread throughout the country.
居家隔离、远程办公、大学生放假时间延长，这一系列的行为成为人们的共识。
Isolation at home, telecommuting, and longer vacations for college students have become a common understanding.
在这种背景下，线下娱乐基本暂停，诸多综艺节目、演唱会暂停，餐饮业也基本处于休业当中，人们活动的范围基本局限在家里，“宅”成了大家的一致选择。
In this context, offline entertainment basically suspended, a number of variety shows, concerts suspended, the catering industry is also basically in recess, the scope of people's activities basically limited to the home, "the house" has become everyone's unanimous choice.
但是，“宅”并不能阻止人们渴望娱乐的心情，线上娱乐开始成为人们新的关注点，云蹦迪就开始成为年轻人一种新的选择方向。
But, while mansion doesn't stop people craving entertainment, online entertainment is becoming a new focus, and Yun Jumping is becoming a new direction for young people.
云蹦迪真的蹦得起来吗？TAXX号称是国内最贵的夜店，传闻明星郑恺是其背后的老板之一。
Can Yun Jumping really jump up? TAXX is claimed to be the most expensive nightclub in China, rumored star Zheng Kay is one of his bosses.
在美团的大众点评上，作为有名的蹦迪场所，这家TAXX夜店有着4.87分的评分，网友对此呼声很高。
The TAXX nightclub scored 4.87 out of the US group's popular reviews as a well-known bungee jumping venue, and netizens were very vocal about it.
这家夜店单天营收并不清楚，但有大众点评网友评论，开在上海巨鹿路上的TAXX，每天晚上路两边都是人流密集、豪车扎堆，停满各种超跑豪车，包括法拉利、兰博基尼、迈凯伦和劳斯莱斯等。
The night club's single-day revenues aren't clear, but critics say, TAXX, on Shanghai's Ju Lu Road, is packed with people and cars on both sides of the road every night, packed with luxury cars, including Ferrari, Lamborghini, McLaren and Rolls-Royce.
从这点看来，作为国内的顶级夜店，每天的营收必然不低。
From this point of view, as the country's top night shop, daily revenue is bound to be not low.
由于疫情，这家大型的线下娱乐场所也不得不关停。
As a result of the epidemic, this large off-line entertainment has had to close down.
但是，在今年元宵节的当天，这家夜店采取了另外一种线上蹦迪的方式，也就是所谓的云蹦迪。
But on the day of the Lantern Festival this year, the store took another form of online bungee jumping, called Yun Jumping.
云蹦迪，顾名思义，就是将以往线下蹦迪转移到线上，直播DJ（打碟师）打碟，宅在家里的人通过不同的移动端设备进行互动。
Yun Jumping, as the name implies, is the transfer of former offline Jumps to the online, live DJ (disc player) discs, the people at home interact through different mobile devices.
那么，云蹦迪真的能吸引那些酷爱线下社交的人吗？2月8日，TAXX官方微信发布消息，在元宵节当晚，这家夜店将在抖音进行线上直播，从晚上10点到下半夜2点，每一个小时有一位DJ主持。
So will Yun Jumping really appeal to those who love to socialize offline? On Feb. 8, the TAXX official microphone announced that on the night of the Lantern Festival, the night of the night will be broadcast live online, with a DJ presiding every hour from 10pm to 2am.
如今查看TAXX的这篇推送，也不过只有6000多次的阅读量。
Now look at TAXX this push, but only more than 6000 times to read.
按照这种情况来推测的话，可能当天晚上的云蹦迪不见得会有比较好的效果。
According to this kind of situation conjecture, probably that night the cloud bungee will not have the better effect.
然而，实际情况并不是这样。
However, this is not the case.
在TAXX传出晚上要进行云蹦迪的消息后，越来越多的人开始参与这场云狂欢之中。
More and more people began to join the cloud carnival after news of a night of cloud-hopping from TAXX.
当晚在活动开始之后，TAXX的直播就在抖音上获得了爆炸性的关注，诸多网友踊跃参与，纷纷打赏。
Later that night, after the event began, TAXX's live broadcast received explosive attention on shake sound, and many netizens actively participated in it.
根据TAXX的官方数据统计，这场持续4小时的云蹦迪，在整个直播期间，打赏总收入达728.5万音浪，同时持续霸榜抖音直播小时榜。
According to TAXX's official statistics, the four-hour cloud bungee whiz made a total of 7.285 million sound waves over the course of the broadcast, while continuing to top the list of hours of airtime airtime.
音浪是抖音目前的虚拟货币，按照抖音的兑换比例为1：10，换句话说，就是人民币1元钱相当于10个音浪，这样算下来，TAXX这场云蹦迪单单直播打赏收入便高达70余万元人民币。
The sound wave is the current dummy currency, according to the dithering ratio of 1: 10, in other words, 1 yuan is equivalent to 10 sound waves, so that TAXX this cloud bounty income alone will be more than 700,000 yuan.
即使考虑到同抖音直播平台的分成，TAXX这场云蹦迪收入还是十分可观的，毕竟没了线下的费用。
Even taking into account the share of the same dither live broadcast platform, TAXX this cloud bounty is still very considerable, after all did not have offline expenses.
图片来源：TAXX官方微信另外，在直播之后，TAXX就宣布将元宵节当晚的直播收入全部捐给武汉，以转化为对武汉疫情的帮助，用于支持武汉新型冠状病毒肺炎的防疫工作，并且已经与有关的基金会取得了联系，还表示，捐助的具体细节和过程都会以公开透明的方式公示给大众。
In addition, after the broadcast, TAXX donated all the proceeds from the night of the Lantern Festival to Wuhan to help with the epidemic prevention of the new coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, and has contacted relevant foundations, saying details and procedures of the donation will be made public in an open and transparent manner.
值得注意的是，这条消息是在元宵节后的第二天推送的，阅读量高达5.1万次，远超前一天6000多次的阅读量。
Remarkably, the news reached 51,000 people the day after the Lantern Festival, far more than 6,000 times the previous day's reading.
TAXX的老板娘也发朋友圈表示，这次云蹦迪并不是为了博人眼球，而是在考虑如何让线下娱乐场所找到新的突破口。
TAXX's wife also sent out friends, said that the cloud is not to blog about the eyeball, but to consider how to let the online entertainment venues find a new breakthrough.
图片来源：TAXX官方微信但从TAXX这次云蹦迪的结果来看，对于大众来说，云蹦迪，这种虚拟的线上娱乐方式，真的存在巨大的潜藏市场。
http: / / TAXX Official Letter But judging by the results of TAXX's cloud-hopping, there is a huge potential market for the general public for Yun Jumping, a virtual online entertainment.
不仅仅是上海的TAXX，著名夜店ONE THIRD也在抖音开设了云锐舞直播。
Not only in Shanghai TAXX, the famous night store ONE THIRD also opened a live Yun Rui dance live in Shaoxing.
开播时间不到10分钟，直播在线人数就已经破万，不到1小时，音浪值破100万。
Less than 10 minutes into broadcast time, the number of live online has been broken, less than an hour, breaking the sound wave value of 1 million.
等到次日凌晨2点结束时，直播间累计在线人数已经超过121.3万人，音浪值最终达到了1931.6万，也就是近200万元人民币的打赏。
By the end of the morning, more than 1.213 million people were online, giving a total of 19.316 million, or nearly 2 million yuan.
累计在线人数超百万人，这个客流量可能不是任何一家线下夜店一晚可以达到的程度。
With more than a million people online, this traffic may not be nearly as big as any one off-line nightclub can reach in a single night.
即使是一场声势浩大的演唱会，全场人数囊括在一起也不过几万人。
Even a big concert, the total number of people together is only tens of thousands.
国内其他视频领域的巨头似乎也都嗅到了这当中潜藏的商机。
Other video giants in the country seem to be sniffing out potential business opportunities.
2月4日草莓音乐节主办方摩登天空与B站联合发起“宅草莓不是音乐节”的直播，它每天直播6小时，单日在线最高49万人。
The strawberry festival, which is broadcast live six hours a day and can reach up to 490,000 people a day, is co-sponsored by organisers of the Strawberry Festival on Feb. 4.
另外，与抖音齐名的另一个短视频平台快手，也在近日发起了“不如云蹦迪”，来自北京、青岛、长沙、苏州、成都、重庆等一二线城市的众多头部夜店和厂牌纷纷入驻快手，进行“云蹦迪”直播，自2月10日开始，每晚都有“云蹦迪”排期，在快手搜索“蹦迪”即可观看直播。
In addition, another short video platform, named after the chatter, has recently launched "Jumping the Cloud," a huge number of head clubs and brands from No.2 cities, including Beijing, Qingdao, Changsha, Suzhou, Chengdu and Chongqing, which have been running "Yun Jumping" every night since February 10.
其中，有相关直播开播不到半小时，圈粉30万人，同时在线人数超过10万人，总观众超过231人次，点赞达到了300多万次。
Among them, less than half an hour of live broadcast, 300,000 circle powder, more than 100,000 people online at the same time, total audience of more than 231, praise reached more than 3 million.
根据中国产业研究院数据显示，2018年，国内酒吧数量已经突破6万家，预计解决了近千万人的就业问题，行业市场规模达到451亿元。
By 2018, the number of bars in the country had exceeded 60,000, according to the China Institute of Industrial Research, which was expected to solve employment problems for nearly 10 million people, with a market size of 45.1 billion yuan.
这也就意味着云蹦迪可能也有着如此庞大的潜在市场，甚至更大，因为互联网毕竟可以触达更多的人。
This means that Yun Jumping may also have such a large potential market, or even larger, because the Internet can reach more people.
就目前来看，云蹦迪好像真的蹦起来了。
As far as I'm concerned, Yun Jumping really seems to jump.
“云蹦迪”能蹦多久？“云蹦迪这样的项目，其实之前就关注到了，但是感觉一般，都放下了。
How long can "cloud bungee" jump? "Cloud bungee such a project, in fact, before the attention, but feel general, all put down.
”有一级市场做投资相关的从业者和笔者这样表示。
There is a primary market to do investment-related practitioners and the author said.
不仅仅是云蹦迪，太多的“云娱乐”都在这段“宅空档”时期先后大火。
Not just Yun Jumping, too many "cloud entertainment" in this period of "mansion gap" successively fire.
今年春节期间，手机游戏市场尤其火爆。
This Spring Festival period, the mobile phone game market is particularly hot.
根据第三方数据，春节期间《王者荣耀》及《和平精英》的日活跃用户数量峰值分别在1.2亿至1.5亿人及0.8亿至1.0亿人之间，均创下历史新高。
According to third-party data, the number of active users of Glory of the King and Elites of Peace peaked at between 120 million and 150 million and between 80 million and 100 million people, respectively, during the Spring Festival.
《王者荣耀》在大年三十单日流水超20亿元人民币，这是目前世界上单款娱乐产品单日流水最高的纪录。
"The glory of the king" in the New Year's 30 super-RMB 2 billion, this is the world's single entertainment products the highest daily record.
除此以外，线上棋牌游戏也在这段时间表现优异。
In addition, online chess games also performed well during this period.
根据七麦数据公开披露的数据进行统计，农历腊月三十至正月初六期间，排名上升最快的10款游戏中有7款是棋牌类游戏；排名上升最快的20款游戏中有14款棋牌类游戏。
Seven of the 10 fastest-growing games between the 30th and 6th of January were chess games, according to publicly disclosed data from the 7wheat data. Fourteen of the 20 fastest-growing games were board games.
民生证券研报显示，线上棋牌类游戏下载量明显爆发，棋牌类游戏下载量峰值对比疫情发生前来看，都上升了200%以上。
Minsheng Securities Research, online chess game download apparently broke out, chess game download peak compared to the peak before the outbreak, more than 200%.
那么这种云娱乐到底能不能持续下去呢？1月29日，在港股市场鼠年首个交易日上，线上娱乐领域的股票大涨，在线棋牌游戏的联众上涨2.13%，经营儿童在线娱乐节目及在线游戏的百奥家庭互动上涨4.94%，香港电视大涨13.72%。
On January 29, on the first trading day of the Hong Kong stock market, shares in online entertainment jumped 2.13 per cent, online board games rose 2.13 per cent, family interaction with the Olympic family, which operates children's online entertainment and games, rose 4.94 per cent and Hong Kong television 13.72 per cent.
根据德璞资本的研究，线上娱乐领域的概念股虽然有短期炒作因素存在，但参照美股市场来看，随着互联网衍生出的包括影视、游戏、社交、工作、教育等多元服务渗透到生活的每一方面，相关产业也迎来了更大的发展契机。
According to the research of DPu, although the concept of online entertainment has short-term speculation factors, but the U.S. stock market, with the Internet derived from film and television, games, social, work, education and other services into every aspect of life, the relevant industries have also ushered in a greater opportunity for development.
德邦基金的基金经理夏理曼认为，随着5G时代的到来，游戏、视频等应用的发展趋势几乎不会受疫情影响。
With the advent of the 5G era, the trend in gaming, video and other applications will have little impact on the epidemic, says Charlemagne, a fund manager at Devon.
如果按照这个推测来看，即使在疫情过去以后，人们不再宅，线下蹦迪重启，但是云蹦迪这样的线上娱乐，基于已经形成一段时间的行为习惯，很可能也会仍然存在市场。
If this were to be assumed, even after the epidemic is over, people would no longer be homebound and offline bungee jumping would be restarted, but online entertainment like Yun Jumping would probably still exist, based on behavior that has been around for some time.
