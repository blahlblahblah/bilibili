这里发生的许多事都早于武汉市区，他们最早收治新冠肺炎的重症患者，最早腾空自己的病区，最早进驻了外援，也最早面对“救一个死一个”的危重症之险。
Many of what happened here predates the Wuhan city district, they first admitted the new crown pneumonia severe patients, the first to empty their own sick area, the first to enter foreign aid, but also the earliest face of "save a dead one" critical risk.
金银潭在2019年12月30日至少接收到了27名病人。
The Gold and Silver Pool received at least 27 patients on 30 December 2019.
以同济医院呼吸与重症科主任赵建平为首的28位武汉医学专家在金银潭会诊了这27名病人，其中13名重症。
Twenty-eight Wuhan medical experts, headed by Zhao Jianping, director of respiratory and severe medicine at Tongji Hospital, met with the 27 patients in the gold and silver pool, 13 of whom were critically ill.
由于缺少最重要的病原学支持，五位专家并未就老王是否死于病毒性肺炎达成一致，这或是其未成为官方通报第一例死亡患者的原因。
In the absence of the most important etiological support, the five experts did not agree on whether Lao Wang died of viral pneumonia, or whether he was not officially notified as the first case of death.

院区外建筑物稀落，若是走岔到院内小路上，周围就只有树丛与草地。
Outside the courtyard building is sparse, if take turn to courtyard lane, surround only bush and meadow.
2月中武汉落雪，融雪成冰，从腊梅与松树的枝丫上滴滴答答落成了雨声。
In mid-February, Wuhan fell snow, melting into ice, from the ramei and pine branches Ticker completed the rain.
偶尔，你还能看到灰喜鹊，这是一种灰背蓝尾的小胖鸟，只在环境好的地方出现。
Occasionally, you can see the Grey Magpie, a small fat bird with a gray back and blue tail, only found in a good environment.
这里是武汉市突发公共卫生事件医疗救治定点医院，一所远离武汉市区的传染病医院，也是肝病等慢性病患者康复的疗养地。
This is Wuhan city public health emergency medical treatment designated hospital, a far away from Wuhan city infectious disease hospital, but also liver disease and other chronic diseases rehabilitation.
作为一所传染病医院，金银潭有能力最快启动处置传染病的防护机制，但作为一所专科医院，它自身的能力不足以面对此后接连涌入的危重症患者。
As an infectious disease hospital, Gold and Silver Pool has the capacity to activate the protective mechanism for dealing with infectious diseases as quickly as possible, but as a specialist hospital, its own capacity is not sufficient to cope with the successive influx of critically ill patients.
从2019年12月开始，金银潭成为新冠肺炎疫情的暴风之眼。
Since December 2019, the Gold and Silver Pool has been the eye of a squall over the New Crown Pneumonia epidemic.
这里发生的许多事都早于武汉市区，他们最早收治新冠肺炎的重症患者，最早腾空自己的病区，最早进驻了外援，也最早面对“救一个死一个”的危重症之险。
Many of what happened here predates the Wuhan city district, they first admitted the new crown pneumonia severe patients, the first to empty their own sick area, the first to enter foreign aid, but also the earliest face of "save a dead one" critical risk.
今天的金银潭不同于往日。
Today's gold and silver pools are different.
来自全国最精锐的医疗力量重新组成了金银潭，而金银潭是重组武汉新冠肺炎疫情全貌最重要的一块拼图。
The gold-and-silver pool, the most important piece of puzzle for reconstructing Wuhan's New Crown Pneumonia epidemic, was reconstituted by the country's best medical forces.
2020年1月29日，武汉市金银潭医院，医院院长张定宇换装投入工作”。
January 29, 2020, Wuhan City gold and silver pool hospital, hospital director Zhang Dingyu put into operation.
（新华社/图）1第一批病人12月30日发生了很多事，这成为公众所知的武汉疫情第一个关键日。
The first batch of patients happened on December 30th, which became the first crucial day of Wuhan known to the public.
最初，病人不是一个个地来，他们一批被送往金银潭。
At first, the patients did not come one by one. They were sent to the gold and silver pools.
2019年12月29日19:00，金银潭ICU（重症病房）的护士江苇接到了9名不明原因肺炎的患者。
At 1900 hours on December 29, 2019, reed, a nurse at ICU in Gold and Silver Pool, received nine patients with unexplained pneumonia.
他们是同一批，被两辆车从不同的医院接来金银潭。
They were in the same group and were picked up by two vehicles from different hospitals.
这其中，一位跟着转院患者过来的家属，急切地告诉医生自己也有发热症状，或许被传染。
One of them, a family member who had followed the patient to the hospital, was eager to tell the doctor that he, too, had febrile symptoms that might be contagious.
他最终也被收入金银潭住院。
He was eventually admitted to the Gold and Silver Pool.
位于南七楼的ICU在两个小时前突然接到通知，要求原有14名病人转出，空出全部16个床位，整病区消毒，医护人员启用最高级别的三级防护。
The ICU on the south seventh floor was suddenly called in two hours ago to evacuate 14 patients, vacate all 16 beds, disinfect the entire area, and employ the highest level of tertiary protection.
金银潭对三级防护是熟悉的，他们在2019年的军运会前做过针对中东呼吸综合征——一种类SARS的冠状病毒引起的传染病——的演习。
The gold and silver pools are familiar with Level 3 protection, and they conducted an exercise on the Middle East respiratory syndrome, a coronavirus infection of SARS, before the 2019 military games.
“一模一样的最高防护。
"The highest protection of the same.
”江苇说。
"said the reed.
就在几个小时前，湖北省新华医院和武汉市中心医院公共卫生科向湖北省、武汉市卫健委疾控处报告了接诊数名“不明原因病毒性”肺炎患者。
Just a few hours ago, the Xinhua Hospital in Hubei Province and the Public Health Section of Wuhan Central Hospital reported several cases of "unidentified viral pneumonia" to the Health Care and Prevention Bureau in Hubei and Wuhan.
这天下午，省、市两级卫健委疾控处通知省、市、区三级疾控中心，上述两医院收治多名有华南海鲜市场暴露史的不明原因肺炎患者，要求启动应急处置工作流程，同时，金银潭和两级疾控中心开始流行病学调查。
On the afternoon of the same day, the Provincial and Municipal Health Care and Disease Control Offices notified provincial, municipal and district CDC level that the two hospitals had treated a number of patients with unexplained pneumonia with a history of exposure to the South China seafood market.
当晚，金银潭的业务副院长黄朝林带人从新华医院接走6位病人，华科大附属同济医院亦有1名不明原因肺炎患者转入金银潭。
In the evening, the Vice-Dean of the Gold and Silver Pool, Wong Cha-lam, collected six patients from Xinhua Hospital and one patient from Tongji Hospital, affiliated with WKU, was transferred to the Gold and Silver Pool.
基于传染病的处置方法，这些病人无论病情轻重，都只能被送入已经被隔离起来的ICU。
Based on the treatment of infectious diseases, these patients, regardless of the severity of their illness, can only be sent to the isolated ICU.
第二天，12月30日发生了很多事，这成为公众所知的武汉疫情第一个关键日。
The next day, December 30, a lot of things happened, which became known as Wuhan the first critical day of the epidemic.
这天，院长张定宇牵头收集了最早收治的7名病人的支气管肺泡灌洗液，并送往中科院武汉病毒所进行检测，这是人类认识不明原因肺炎的关键一步。
Zhang Dingyu took the lead in collecting bronchoalveolar lotion from the first seven patients and sent it to the Wuhan virus unit of the Chinese Academy of Sciences for testing.
三天后，研究所确定了新型冠状病毒的全基因组序列，并在2020年1月5日成功分离到了病毒毒株。
Three days later, the Institute identified a genome-wide sequence of the new coronavirus, which was successfully isolated from the virus strain on January 5, 2020.
南四楼被紧急改造成隔离病房，封闭缓冲间，所有通道改成单向通道，这本是一个新装修完毕，准备接收流感患者（当月金银潭收治了大量流感患者）的普通病区。
The fourth floor was converted into an emergency isolation ward with a closed buffer zone and all passages were converted into a one-way passageway, which was supposed to be a newly renovated common area for influenza patients (who received a large number of flu cases in that month's gold and silver pools).
接下来一段时间，金银潭几乎每天都新开一个病区，以容纳从市内各院转院而来的患者。
Over the next few days, the gold and silver pools opened a new section almost daily to accommodate patients transferred from various inner-city hospitals.
金银潭在12月30日至少接收到了27名病人。
The gold and silver pools received at least 27 patients on December 30.
以同济医院呼吸与重症科主任赵建平为首的28位武汉医学专家在金银潭会诊了这27名病人，其中13名重症。
Twenty-eight Wuhan medical experts, headed by Zhao Jianping, director of respiratory and severe medicine at Tongji Hospital, met with the 27 patients in the gold and silver pool, 13 of whom were critically ill.
此后赵建平担任湖北省医疗救治组组长，牵头制定湖北省的新冠肺炎治疗方案。
Since then Zhao Jianping as the Hubei province medical treatment group leader, leading the Hubei Province New Crown Pneumonia treatment program.
这天下午四点，南四楼的52张床位开始接收不明原因肺炎病患。
At four o'clock that afternoon, 52 beds on the fourth floor south began to receive patients suffering from unexplained pneumonia.
护士长刘萍和三个护士熬了一夜，收了大约十五个病人。
LU Ping, the head nurse, and three nurses stayed up the night and took in about fifteen patients.
当丈夫送衣服来医院时，刘萍站在医院大门口冲着丈夫哭：“我感觉事情没说的那么简单。
When her husband sent clothes to the hospital, Liu Ping stood at the door of the hospital and cried at her husband. "I don't think it's that simple.
”“虽然我也不知道是什么病，可我看到了很多人的片子都是白肺。
"" I don't know what it is, but I see a lot of people's films are white lungs.
SARS我虽然没经历过，但多少也了解一点。
SARS I haven't experienced it, but I know a bit about it.
”情绪糅杂，她想到医护人员或许会有危险了。
Her emotions were all mixed up, and she thought the paramedics might be in danger.
刘萍收治病人时，武汉市中心医院眼科医生李文亮在微信同学群中发了消息：“华南水果海鲜市场确诊了7例SARS，在我们医院急诊科隔离”。
When Liu Ping was admitted to hospital, Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital, told the class: "Seven cases of SARS were confirmed in the South China fruit and seafood market, isolated in our hospital emergency department."
后来，李文亮因收治一名感染新冠肺炎的青光眼患者而出现发热和呼吸困难，于1月31日确诊新冠肺炎，6日后医治无效离世。
He later developed fever and shortness of breath after receiving treatment for a glaucoma with pneumonia. He was diagnosed with pneumonia on January 31 and died six days later.
也是在金银潭南四楼开始接收不明原因肺炎的同一时间，12月30日16:00，武汉市卫健委应该已经收到全武汉医院上报的所有病例——两份红头文件《关于做好不明原因肺炎救治工作的紧急通知》和《市卫生健康委关于报送不明原因肺炎救治情况的紧急通知》下达各医疗机构，要求各医院清查统计最近一周接诊过的，有类似特点的不明原因肺炎患者，12月30日16:00是文件中要求上报的时间。
At 16: 00 on December 30, the Wuhan Health Protection Commission should have received all the cases reported by Wuhan Hospital - two Red Notices on Treating Unexplained Pneumonia and the Emergency Notice of the Municipal Health Commission on the Treatment of Unexplained Pneumonia.
三级疾控中心形成《关于医院报告华南海鲜市场多例肺炎病例情况的调查处置报告》。
The CDC Level III formed the Report on the Investigation and Disposal of Cases of Pneumonia in the South China Seafood Market.
回过头看，12月30日，各方对不明原因肺炎的响应速度之快与后续疫情一度失控产生鲜明的对比：许多人已经站在了警铃的面前，但为何警报没有拉响？2第一个死者是谁？1月9日，老曾成为官方通报的首位死者，但他并不是第一个死在金银潭的病人。
Looking back, on December 30, the rapid response to unexplained pneumonia contrasted sharply with a subsequent outbreak that had spiralled out of control: many people were standing in front of the alarm, but why didn't the alarm go off? 2 Who was the first dead?
两日前，67岁的老王在金银潭离世。
Two days ago, 67-year-old Wang died in the gold and silver pool.
老曾是官方披露的第一位死于不明原因肺炎的病人。
Lao was the first officially disclosed patient to die of pneumonia from unknown causes.
老曾送进ICU的时候已经不行了。
Old used to be sent into the ICU when the time is no longer.
二十天前，他发热、咳嗽、食欲衰退。
Twenty days ago, he had a fever, a cough and a loss of appetite.
辗转过街道医院和二甲医院都没有改善，呼吸困难四天后，他在2019年12月31日深夜插着管，带着呼吸机转入金银潭ICU。
After four days of difficulty breathing, he was transferred to the ICU in the gold and silver pool with a ventilator and a tube inserted late at night on 31 December 2019.
他今年61岁，常年在华南海鲜批发市场采购货物，患有慢性肝病和腹部粘液瘤。
He is 61 years old and buys goods at the South China Wholesale Seafood Market, suffering from chronic liver disease and abdominal myxomatosis.
金银潭已经进驻了来自国家卫健委和武汉市的专家，他们对ICU的每一个病例举行会诊。
Gold and Silver Pool has been deployed from the National Health Commission and Wuhan City experts, they hold consultations on each ICU case.
老曾入院第二天，专家组判断他的病情处于极期，救命为主。
The day after his admission, the Panel determined that his condition was extreme and life-saving.
ECMO治疗为目前可用手段，争取条件进行ECMO治疗。
ECMO treatment is currently available and conditions are sought for ECMO treatment.
ECMO是体外生命支持的最强手段，可以暂时替代患者的心肺功能，为患者争取到心肺康复的时间。
ECMO is the most powerful means of life support in vitro, which can temporarily replace the cardiopulmonary function of patients, and achieve recovery time of cardiopulmonary bypass.
但ECMO不能支持心肺之外的器官，患者的心肺必须要能自愈。
But ECMO does not support organs other than the heart and lungs, which must heal themselves.
1月1日深夜，老曾被上了ECMO，他是此次疫情中第一个被使用ECMO抢救的病人。
Late in the night of January 1, he was admitted to ECMO, the first patient to be rescued by ECMO in the outbreak.
事实上，医生们都知道老曾的多器官衰竭难以逆转，随时可能死亡。
In fact, doctors know that chronic multi-organ failure is hard to reverse and can kill at any time.
在ECMO转着的日子里，老曾出现了双侧瞳孔散大，双肺呼吸音极弱，几次濒危，都靠着急救手段拉了回来。
In the days of ECMO rotation, the old appeared bilateral pupil dilated, lung breathing extremely weak, several endangered, have been pulled back by means of first aid.
中南医院一位参与新冠肺炎救治的医生透露，他们在1月初就知道不明原因肺炎会死人，“金银潭有个病人已经不行了，只是一直拿ECMO转着”。
A doctor involved in treating pneumonia in the central South China hospital said he knew in early January that pneumonia was a cause of death. "There's a patient in the gold and silver pool who has just been taking ECMO."
1月9日，老曾成为官方通报的首位死者，但他并不是第一个死在金银潭的病人。
On January 9, he became the first person officially declared dead, but he was not the first to die in a gold and silver hole.
两日前，67岁的老王在金银潭离世。
Two days ago, 67-year-old Wang died in the gold and silver pool.
老王曾在协和肿瘤医院和协和医院接受治疗，两次转院之间的一周里，他的肺从部分感染变成全白。
Wang was treated at Concorde Cancer Hospital and Concorde Hospital, and during the week between the hospital transfers, his lungs turned from partially infected to fully white.
他的妹妹、女儿、女婿，也陆续出现了与他类似的症状。
His sister, daughter, son-in-law, also appeared in succession with his similar symptoms.
协和医院曾组织呼吸科专家会诊，并给老王插管抢救，无明显改善，建议送往金银潭救治。
Concorde Hospital had organized a respiratory specialist consultation, and to Lao Wang intubation rescue, no obvious improvement, proposed to send to gold and silver pool for treatment.
1月7日，在被送入金银潭3日后，老王因“重度肺炎”去世。
Wang died of "severe pneumonia" three days after being sent to the gold and silver pool on January 7.
医生告诉家属，他是这场疫情中第一个死去的患者。
The doctor told the family that he was the first patient to die from the outbreak.
老王死亡当日，五位专家针对他死因的讨论出现了分歧。
On the day of Lao Wang's death, five experts disagreed over the cause of his death.
有三位专家的意见是不明原因肺炎合并细菌性肺炎——病毒性肺炎合并细菌感染是一种临床上的常见现象。
Three experts are of the opinion that pneumonia combined with bacterial pneumonia - viral pneumonia with bacterial infection is a common clinical phenomenon.
有两位专家认为是细菌性肺炎，或认为其临床和影像学表现像病毒性肺炎，但无病原学，可排除。
Two experts believe that bacterial pneumonia, or its clinical and imaging appearance like viral pneumonia, but no etiology, can be excluded.
最终主持人小结为：重度肺炎，合并急性呼吸窘迫综合征、感染性休克等并发症，并伴有原发性高血压。
Finally the host Xiaoqi: severe pneumonia, combined with acute respiratory distress syndrome, infectious shock and other complications, accompanied by essential hypertension.
彼时，国家疾控中心尚未向武汉提供PCR核酸检测试剂盒，无法确定老王的病因。
At that time, the National CDC has not provided Wuhan with PCR nucleic acid test kits, can not determine the cause of Lao Wang.
老王去世后，曾有专家与其女儿沟通能否进行遗体解剖，但最终未成。
After Lao Wang died, there was an expert to communicate with her daughter whether to carry out an autopsy, but ultimately failed.
由于缺少最重要的病原学支持，五位专家并未就老王是否死于病毒性肺炎达成一致，这或是其未成为官方通报第一例死亡患者的原因。
In the absence of the most important etiological support, the five experts did not agree on whether Lao Wang died of viral pneumonia, or whether he was not officially notified as the first case of death.
老曾的情况不一样，他是被“选中的样本”。
Old Zen's case was different, he was "chosen as a sample".
转入金银潭的第二天，他被采集了肺泡灌洗液样本送去检测。
The day after he was transferred to the gold and silver pool, he was taken samples of alveolar lotion for testing.
1月27日发表于《中华医学杂志（英文版）》的论文《鉴定一种新型冠状病毒导致人类严重肺炎：一项描述性研究》显示，作为采集样本之一的老曾感染了新型冠状病毒。
"Identifying a new coronavirus that causes severe pneumonia in humans: a descriptive study," published in the Chinese Medical Journal on January 27, showed that the man who was one of the samples was infected with the new coronavirus.
从2019年最后一天开始，金银潭南七楼ICU正式收治他们的第一批病人。
From the last day of 2019, the ICU officially admitted their first patients on the 7th floor of Gold and Silver Pool South.
此后9天，ICU共接收了9名转院而来的不明原因肺炎重症患者。
Over the next nine days, the ICU admitted nine patients with severe unexplained pneumonia who had been transferred to the hospital.
每位患者都经历了七到八项核酸检测，包括甲流、乙流、军团菌肺炎、登革热、腺病毒等，以确认其是否患有某种人类已知的病毒性传染病。
Each patient underwent seven to eight nucleic acid tests, including A, B, Legionella pneumoniae, dengue fever, adenovirus, etc., to determine whether they had a human-known viral infection.
检测结果显示，ICU收治的所有病人，体内存在的是人类未知的病毒。
Tests showed that all patients treated by the ICU had viruses in their bodies that were unknown to humans.
那时，还没有人知道这种未知病毒会带来多少死亡。
At the time, no one knew how many deaths the unknown virus would cause.
在金银潭ICU工作了11年的医生张巍看着病人的CT，觉得和H7N9禽流感很像。
Zhang Wei, an 11-year-old doctor at the ICU in Gold and Silver Pool, looked at his patient's CT and felt like the H7N9 avian flu.
他以为这不过是一场来势汹汹，但伤亡范围极小的疫情。
He thought it was just a small but aggressive outbreak with few casualties.
“刚开始接触这些病人，我觉得这有什么，不就是一般的禽流感么？但是后来……”张巍报出了四个名字，他们一个接一个地死亡。
"At the beginning of contact with these patients, I think what is here, is not the normal avian influenza? But then..." Zhang Wei quoted four names, one after another they died.
他不愿意回忆那段日子：“太灰色，听不到好消息。
He did not want to recall those days: "Too gray to hear the good news.
”根据卫健部门通报数据，截至3月5日，武汉市有2305人死于新冠肺炎。
As of March 5, 2,305 people had died of pneumonia in Wuhan, according to figures released by the Ministry of Health.
而在2020年年初，就像武汉医院的门诊还未意识到新冠病毒的传染性之剧烈，金银潭也尚未意识到新冠肺炎的危重病人是多么残酷。
And in early 2020, just as clinics at Wuhan Hospital did not realize how contagious the new crown virus was, the gold and silver pools were not aware of the cruelty of the critically ill with pneumonia.
3开病区从12月31日到1月8日，金银潭ICU收入的9名不明原因肺炎病人均不幸离世。
From December 31 to January 8, 9 patients with pneumonia from the ICU in Gold and Silver Pool died of unexplained pneumonia.
生命被支撑最久的病人，在ICU里待了22天。
The patients whose lives were most sustained spent 22 days in the ICU.
南方周末记者请赵建平为本次疫情的发展拉一条时间轴，他将第一个时间点划在12月30日——他首次参与会诊金银潭。
Southern Weekend reporter asked Zhao Jianping to draw a time axis for the development of this epidemic, he set the first point on December 30 - his first time to participate in the consultation gold and silver pool.
第二个关键节点是1月10日，“当天病人明显多了，那时候开始出现医务人员感染。
The second key node was Jan. 10, "when the patient became noticeably more ill, and infections began to appear among medical staff.
”专家会诊的结果之一是，从1月1日起，金银潭都有各级专家值班会诊，武汉市卫健委抽调了武汉市第二医院、第三医院、第四医院、武昌医院等医院的医务人员前来支援。
"One of the results of the expert consultation was that from January 1, gold and silver pools were visited by specialists at all levels, and medical staff from Wuhan City's Second, Third, Fourth and Wuchang Hospitals were seconded.
即使这样，在1月上旬的金银潭，多位医护均表示不清楚这到底是一个什么样的疫情。
Even so, in the gold-and-silver pool in early January, many health-care professionals said they did not know what the epidemic was.
武汉市卫健委认为不明原因肺炎不存在“人传人”，但“人传人”的猜测已在金银潭内流传。
Wuhan city health committee believes that there is no "human-to-human" pneumonia due to unknown causes, but "human-to-human" speculation has spread in the gold and silver pools.
ICU主任吴文娟再三向科室强调，一定要做好自我防护。
ICU Director Wu Wenjuan repeatedly stressed to the department, must do a good job of self-defense.
“病人越来越多，我们慢慢就意识到这个病真的跟以前是不一样的。
"As the number of patients grew, we gradually realized that the disease was really different.
以前只会告诉我们做好防护，没有那么认真地和我们说。
It used to tell us to be on guard, not to talk to us so seriously.
”ICU护士江苇回忆说。
"recalls ICU Nurse Jiang Wei.
在赵建平划出的第二个时间节点1月10日上，中南医院ICU的16张病床在那天住满；某个三甲医院急救中心每天需要住院的急重症病人达30-50人。
On Jan. 10, 16 beds in the ICU of Zhongnan Hospital were filled on that day, and 30 to 50 people needed to be hospitalized daily at a hospital's emergency and first aid centre.
而金银潭已经收满了至少五个非ICU病区，每个病区有四十多名病人。
The gold and silver pools are already full of at least five non-ICU areas, each with more than 40 patients.
这天，金银潭将ICU之外的病人分成轻症和重症两类，分类安置病房。
On this day, the gold and silver pool will ICU outside the patient into light illness and severe illness, the classification of the placement ward.
1月5日8:00至1月10日，武汉市卫健委未有通报不明原因肺炎感染人数。
From 8: 00 on January 5 to 10, Wuhan city health committee did not report the number of people infected with pneumonia due to unknown causes.
此后，1月11日至1月17日，湖北省两会在武汉召开，连续七日，武汉市卫健委通报不明原因肺炎患者无新增。
From January 11 to January 17, the Hubei Provincial People's Congress was held in Wuhan, and for the seventh day in a row, the Wuhan Health Commission reported no new cases of unexplained pneumonia.
而市郊的金银潭ICU内，却忙得一个人当四个人用。
And the outskirts of the gold and silver pool ICU, but busy as a person for four people.
病人多，病情重，护士们接连给他们上呼吸机，上CRRT（连续肾脏替代疗法），上ECMO。
The patients were so numerous and serious that the nurses continued to give them a ventilator, CRRT (Continuous Renal Substitution Therapy) and ECMO.
ICU内的机器增加了大约二十台，以前一个护士管一台CRRT，现在一度出现一个人管四台。
The number of machines in the ICU has increased by about twenty. A nurse used to run a CRRT, but now there is one person in charge of four.
每个病人需要高压氧的持续供应，医院原有的氧源不够，需要氧气罐补给。
Each patient needs a continuous supply of hyperbaric oxygen. The hospital does not have enough oxygen to supply it.
一个氧气罐只能用一小时不到，送氧师傅赶不过来，护士们就自己去搬比人还高的氧气罐。
An oxygen tank can only last less than an hour. The oxygen carriers can't get around. The nurses move their own tanks, which are higher than human oxygen.
连续工作到1月下旬时，有个护士在晚上搬氧气罐的途中晕倒，护士长坚持让她休息三天，可她只休息了一天，因为人手不够。
In late January, a nurse fainted on the way to the oxygen tank at night, and the head nurse insisted that she rest for three days, but only for one day because she was understaffed.
疫情至今，ICU内先后有两位怀孕的护士，担心在疫情中拍CT或是喝中药影响了胎儿，选择打掉了孩子。
So far, the ICU has two pregnant nurses, worried about the outbreak of CT or drink Chinese medicine affected the fetus, choose to knock out the child.
一个月的时间里，金银潭全院3栋楼21层病区，全部用于收治新冠肺炎病人。
In one month, all three buildings in the 21-storey hospital were used to treat patients with Newcomial Pneumonia.
其中，四个普通病区被改造成ICU病区。
Among them, four common disease areas were transformed into ICU disease areas.
另一边，ICU医生张巍感到挫败，这些病人“很特殊，和以前的H7N9、H1N1病人有很大不同。
On the other hand, Dr. Zhang Wei, an ICU doctor, was frustrated that the patients were "very special and very different from previous patients of H7N9 or H1N1."
我们花了很大的精力，付出了极大的辛苦和努力，但这些病人大多数都没好”。
We put a lot of effort and effort into it, but most of these patients are not doing well.
多个信源向南方周末记者确证，从12月31日到1月8日，金银潭ICU收入的9名不明原因肺炎病人均不幸离世。
Sources confirmed to Southern Weekend that nine unidentified pneumonia patients had died between December 31 and January 8.
生命被支撑最久的病人，在ICU里待了22天。
The patients whose lives were most sustained spent 22 days in the ICU.
4孤岛1月初，武汉市卫健委已经给出一种支援金银潭的方案：七家医疗能力较强的医院各出三个专家，带着本院的ICU护士，以一周为周期，在金银潭轮流值班。
At the beginning of January, Wuhan city health committee has given a scheme to support gold and silver pools: three experts from each of the seven hospitals with strong medical capabilities, and ICU nurses from the hospital will take turns working in the gold and silver pools on a one-week cycle.
1月中旬的金银潭宛如一座孤岛。
The gold and silver pools in mid-January were like an island.
谈起那段日子，张巍总是目光游移，试图忘记；江苇语气急促，忧心忡忡；蔡艳萍则使劲儿用脚尖在地面上打转儿，不知道该不该把心里的苦闷说出口。
When Zhang Wei talked about those days, Zhang Wei always looked around and tried to forget. The reeds were anxious and anxious, while Cai Yanping whirled around the ground with her toes, not knowing whether to tell the pain in her heart.
蔡艳萍是感染二科的副主任医生。
Cai Yanping is the deputy director of Infection Division 2.
她所在的综合楼四楼在1月中上旬被要求不再接收流感病人。
The fourth floor of her complex was asked not to receive flu patients again in the first half of January.
流感病人的出院周期一般为五天，病房里的多数病人都将出院，少数病人被转院至市卫健委的指定医院，继续接受治疗。
Most patients in the ward will be discharged from hospital. A few patients will be transferred to the designated hospital of the municipal health committee for further treatment.
1月20日，蔡艳萍所在病区清空，接收新冠肺炎病人——1月12日，在向世卫组织提交新冠病毒基因序列后一天，武汉市卫健委将不明原因肺炎改称新型冠状病毒感染引起的肺炎（下称“新冠肺炎”）。
On January 20, Cai Yanping was emptied of her diseased area to receive patients with pneumonia. On January 12, one day after submitting the new crown virus gene sequence to the WHO, the Wuhan Health Commission changed the name from unidentified pneumonia to pneumonia caused by a new coronavirus infection.
病区清空后，蔡艳萍所在科室首先支援已经开成新冠肺炎病区的综合一楼。
After emptying the area, Cai Yanping's department first supported the first floor of the complex, which had been opened into the new crown pneumonia area.
她并不知道当时武汉疫情正在怎样发展，“我们没有门诊，就看不到特别混乱的局面”。
She had no idea how the epidemic was unfolding in Wuhan. "We had no out-patient clinics and we couldn't see a particularly chaotic situation."
实话说，蔡艳萍并不感到体力上的辛苦，“12月份收流感也很忙的，基本上就不能休息”，更大的折磨来自精神压力。
To tell the truth, Cai Yanping did not feel the physical hardship, "December flu collection is also very busy, basically can not rest", greater suffering from mental stress.
1月上旬，她首先在与一位同济医院医生的通话中，得知同济医院的门诊已经涌满了发热病人，“如果门诊有那么多病人，住院的病人肯定不会少”。
In early January, she first learned, during a telephone conversation with a doctor at Tongji Hospital, that out-patients at Tongji Hospital were already full of febrile patients and that "if there were so many patients in the clinic, the number of hospitalized patients would certainly not be small."
然后她不断接到亲友、老同学、老病人的电话，询问她能不能来金银潭看病，向她倾诉内心的忧虑。
Then she continued to receive phone calls from relatives, old classmates and old patients, asking her if she could come to see her and tell her about her worries.
她逐渐发现微信是不能看的，无论朋友圈还是公众号，都充斥悲伤甚至惨烈的消息：无法出门，无法看病，无法住院，无法生还。
She gradually discovered that microletters were not to be seen, and that friends and publics alike were filled with sad and even tragic news: unable to go out, unable to see, unable to be hospitalized, unable to survive.
甚至她最好的闺蜜，在春节前后询问她，父亲感染了，是否能进金银潭住院，她都无能为力。
Even her best friend asked her before and after the Spring Festival whether her father was infected and could be hospitalized in a gold and silver pool.
彼时入院金银潭的硬性标准是核酸检测为阳性，而闺蜜的父亲迟迟排不上核酸检测。
The hard criterion for admission was that the nucleic acid test was positive, while the daughter's father was slow to test for nucleic acid.
“如果她父亲晚两周……确诊标准改了，或许就有办法。
"If her father is two weeks late... the criteria for diagnosis have changed, maybe there's a way.
”闺蜜没有主动告诉她的消息是，父亲最终在家中去世。
The girl did not voluntarily tell her that her father had finally died at home.
蔡艳萍所不知道的是，在她的病区之外的会议室里，国家和省市各级医学专家每日都在讨论判别和诊断的标准，《不明原因的病毒性肺炎诊疗方案（试行）》和《新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎诊疗方案（试行）》（即第一版诊疗方案），都是主要基于金银潭的几百个病例讨论出的结果。
What Cai did not know was that in the conference room outside her sick area, medical experts at the national, provincial and municipal levels discussed the criteria for identification and diagnosis on a daily basis. The Diagnosis and Treatment of Unexplained Viral Pneumonia (Trial) and Pneumonia for New Coronavirus Infection (Trial Version 1) are the result of several hundred cases mainly based on gold and silver pools.
在1月16日发布的第一版诊疗方案中，对治疗指出“危重病例应尽早收入ICU治疗。
In the first edition of the protocol, released on January 16, the treatment indicated that "critical cases should be included in ICU treatment as early as possible."
”但后续的疫情救治并没有能按照科学的指导进行，武汉大量的病患因延误治疗，陷入无计可施的危重症。
But follow-up treatment did not follow the scientific guidance, with a large number of patients in Wuhan delayed treatment, into a desperate crisis.
1月初，武汉市卫健委已经给出一种支援金银潭的方案：七家医疗能力较强的医院各出三个专家，带着本院的ICU护士，以一周为周期，在金银潭轮流值班。
In early January, the Wuhan Health Commission offered a scheme to support the gold and silver pools: three specialists from each of the seven hospitals with strong medical capabilities, and ICU nurses from the hospital, on a weekly basis, took turns on duty in the gold and silver pools.
但疫情的进展让这个安排仅仅轮转了一次就失效。
But the advance of the epidemic has rendered the arrangement ineffective only once.
患者人数从1月10日起爆发式增长。
The number of patients has exploded since January 10.
1月11日，同济医院最先抽调钟强和另外四个医护人员，带着医疗设备支援金银潭。
On January 11, Tongji Hospital first deployed Mr Chung and four other medical staff with medical equipment to support the Gold and Silver Pool.
四日后，省卫健委要求同济医院、省人民医院、协和医院，分别接管金银潭的南七楼、南六楼、南五楼。
Four days later, the provincial health committee requested Tongji Hospital, Provincial People's Hospital and Concorde Hospital to take over the seventh floor, the sixth floor and the fifth floor respectively.
这三层楼随后全部改造成重症ICU病房，同时市级医院抽调人手前来支援。
All three floors were subsequently converted into ICU wards, while municipal hospitals deployed staff to support them.
1月19日，省人民医院提出，希望湖北省内组建专门的ICU重症团队支援金银潭。
On January 19, the Provincial People's Hospital proposed that a special ICU intensive care team be set up in Hubei Province to support the gold and silver pools.
五日后，国家卫健委开始抽调各地医疗力量接连进驻。
Five days later, the National Fitness and Health Commission began to draw medical forces from all over the incoming.
“有人来了，还来蛮多，我们真的就觉得好有依靠感了，觉得安全一些了。
"There were people coming and there was a lot going on, and we really felt so dependent and safe.
”蔡艳萍说。
"said Cai Yanping.
金银潭的医护人员已经做出了他们所能做的一切，但仍远不能抵御疫情的扩展。
The health care workers in the gold and silver pools have done all they can, but they are still far from fighting the spread of the epidemic.
5“服了”他一点儿也不悲观，直到去了金银潭。
He was not at all pessimistic until he went to the gold and silver pool.
对新冠肺炎危重症的认识就像是照进黑暗洞穴的手电筒光束：让你看见疫情最危险的一角，视野有限，却足以令人坠入黑暗。
Understanding the critical nature of new crown pneumonia is like a flashlight shining into a dark cave: the most dangerous corner of the epidemic, with limited vision but enough to darken.
同济医院急诊与危重症科副主任钟强是最早在金银潭支援的专家，值班一周后，他得知与自己搭档的金银潭ICU主任吴文娟肺部CT显示感染。
Zhong Qiang, deputy director of emergency and critical care at Tongji Hospital, was one of the first specialists to provide support in the Gold and Silver Pool.
他回同济医院也拍了个CT，同样显示轻微感染。
He returned to Tongji Hospital for a CT scan, which also showed a mild infection.
房明浩来接钟强的班。
Fang Minghao answers Zhong Qiang's class.
他是山东人，胆大性直，语速和他脑子转动的速度一样快。
He was a native of Shandong, bold and straightforward, and spoke at the same speed as his brain.
身为同济医院的急诊与重症医学科副主任，年初时钟强临危受命管理同济医院的发热门诊。
As the deputy director of emergency and severe medicine in Tongji Hospital, the clock was appointed to manage the fever clinic in Tongji Hospital early this year.
那会儿他每天在医院奔波，四处灭火，微信步数从八九千涨到一万六，也没觉得这事儿有多严重，“当时就是觉得发热病人明显多了，搞不好就是甲流那样，一下就过去了。
At that time, he was running around the hospital every day, putting out fires, and the number of little walks went up from eighty-nine thousand to sixteen thousand, without thinking how serious it was.
”那时候他并不悲观，直到去了金银潭。
"He was not pessimistic until he went to the gold and silver pools.
刚到的那会儿，他进病房调呼吸机参数，说：“就没有我降不下来的二氧化碳。
When he arrived, he entered the room and adjusted the ventilator parameters. "There's no carbon dioxide that I can't lower," he said.
”新冠肺炎的危重症病人比一般肺炎病人更早出现二氧化碳潴留，这意味着他们体内因为呼吸不畅缺少氧气后，二氧化碳增加、堆积，影响体内细胞正常的代谢和气体交换。
Critical patients with Newcomial Pneumonia develop CO2 retention earlier than people with normal pneumonia, meaning that their bodies increase and accumulate carbon dioxide after poor breathing and lack of oxygen, affecting normal cell metabolism and gas exchange in the body.
通常来说，调节呼吸机的参数——比如调高呼吸频率，又或者深度镇静完全靠呼吸机给氧——能够一定程度改善这样的情况。
Regulating breathing machine parameters - such as increasing the frequency of breathing, or giving oxygen to a deep calm that depends entirely on a ventilator - can ameliorate the situation to some extent.
但这次，包括房明浩在内的多数重症专家都表示：患者体内的二氧化碳降不下来。
But this time, most experts, including Fang Minghao, said: the patient's body carbon dioxide can not come down.
房明浩走出病房，说自己“服了”。
Fang Minghao walked out of the ward and said he had "taken it."
“到了金银潭才彻底地服了，终于知道这个病有多么重了。
"It took all my gold and silver to get through, and I finally knew how sick I was.
我搞重症二十多年从来没见过病人这么重这么诡异。
I've never seen a patient so heavy in more than 20 years.
”他说。
'he said.
“难，非常难”，至少有十位身在武汉，来自全国各地的重症科或呼吸科专家这样描述新冠肺炎的危重症病人。
"Difficult, very difficult," at least 10 people in Wuhan, from all over the country's intensive care unit or respiratory experts to describe the critically ill patients with new crown pneumonia.
这既有科学上的难题，也有救治条件上的困难。
This not only has the scientific difficulty, also has the cure condition the difficulty.
金银潭首先被指定为新冠肺炎收治医院，其后是肺科医院。
Gold and Silver Pool was first designated as the New Crown Pneumonia Hospital, followed by the Pulmonary Hospital.
以金银潭为例，它的ICU力量薄弱，只有五位医生，全院的各类氧疗仪器加起来不过二十台。
Gold and Silver Pool, for example, has a weak ICU, with only five doctors and only 20 oxygen therapy devices.
1月21日，房明浩接手南七楼ICU的第一天，“班上不下去。
On January 21, Mr. Green took over the first day of ICU on the seventh floor.
”他形容道。
'he said.
ICU只剩下两个本科室医生：张巍和涂超，另外三名医生都处在病休。
The ICU has only two undergraduate doctors: Zhang Wei and Tu Chao, and the other three are on sick leave.
还有两个紧急调来的艾滋病科医生，两个人都迷迷瞪瞪的，诚恳地说“我们会开医嘱，但不会看（这类）病人”，房明浩回忆。
There were also two doctors from the AIDS department, both of whom were staring blankly: "We'll give the doctor's orders, but not the patients," he recalls.
这是此次各方医疗力量支援疫情的一个普遍现象，非呼吸科或急诊重症科的医生，在疫情中间更多是起到补充人手的作用。
This is a common phenomenon of all medical forces supporting the epidemic, non-respiratory or emergency intensive care physicians, in the midst of the epidemic is more of a supplementary role.
接手次日，房明浩与国家卫健委专家组专家杜斌、童朝晖和邱海波一同查房。
Take over the next day, Fang Minghao and national health expert Du Bin, Tong Chaohui and Qiu Haibo together room inspection.
这三位特派的重症科或呼吸科大专家在四天前抵达武汉，每天都进ICU查房。
The three experts arrived in Wuhan four days ago and went into ICU to check in every day.
查房从早上八点开始，先用一个多小时过一遍所有病人的病历，再换防护服进病区。
Starting at 8 a.m., the room check-up begins with an hour or more of all patients' medical records before changing protective clothing into the sick area.
“每个病人查了很久很久，出来之后就说，这样不行，14个病人，如果就一个医生查下来，根本管不过来。
"Every patient looks up for a long time and comes out and says," That's not going to work. Fourteen patients, if just one doctor checks it out, they can't do it.
因为病人太重，你要知道那时候重到什么程度，14个病人一天死5个都有可能。
Because the patient is too heavy, you need to know how heavy that was. Fourteen patients could die five times a day.
”房明浩说。
"said Fang.
ICU的救治难度不看病人数量，是取决于病人的危重。
The difficulty of ICU treatment depends not on the number of patients, but on the critical condition of patients.
“这些病人别说在金银潭的医疗条件，即使以前在我们同济医院的ICU也没有这么重，这里还是14个人都这么重。
"These patients don't have to say they're in gold and silver, even though the ICU in our Tongji Hospital wasn't that heavy. There were 14 people here.
”房明浩说。
"said Fang.
这14个病人的生命体征极其不稳定，可能上一小时看着还不错，下一小时就要抢救。
The vital signs of the 14 patients were extremely erratic, probably looking good for an hour, and had to be rescued the next hour.
升压药物要怎么用，呼吸机怎么调整，液体的出量入量如何平衡，需不需要引流，需不需要抗凝，每天要拍胸片、抽血查生化、做几次血气分析、做几次口腔护理等等，这需要医生对病人有透彻的了解，每时每刻都密切观察。
How to use the booster, how to adjust the ventilator, how to balance the fluid intake, whether you need drainage, anticoagulants, daily chest smears, blood tests, a few blood gas analyses, a few oral treatments, etc. This requires a thorough understanding of the patient by the doctor and close observation at all times.
就算在平时，救治两个ICU病人，就可能让一个医生忙得回不了家。
Even in peacetime, the treatment of two ICU patients, a doctor may be too busy to go home.
现实是，当时病区里只有3名真正的ICU医生。
The reality was that there were only three real ICU doctors in the area.
面对14个病人，医生进去查房一圈，出来可能就得忘记几个病人的事——在传染病房，你不能带任何东西进去，只能凭借大脑记忆。
In the face of 14 patients, the doctor went inside to look around and might have to forget about a few patients - in an infectious room, you couldn't bring anything in, just a mental memory.
即使记忆力卓越，医生也无法分身对每个病人都制定出足够完善的治疗方案。
Even with excellent memory, doctors are not able to devise adequate treatments for every patient.
查房结束的当天下午，三位大专家坐在金银潭ICU里决定，要向国家卫健委申请，再派一些专家进驻金银潭。
On the afternoon of the end of the inspection, three experts sat in the ICU and decided to apply to the State Health Commission and send some more experts to the gold and silver pools.
至少一个病房增加两个专家，一个人管六七个，手下再有三到四个医生做临床救治。
At least one ward should be staffed by two specialists, one for six or seven, and three or four more doctors for clinical care.
次日，1月23日，北京宣武医院重症医学科主任姜利和上海中山医院重症医学科副主任钟鸣，都接到了立刻奔赴武汉的通知。
The next day, January 23, Beijing Xuanwu Hospital, the Director of Severe Medicine Jiang Li and Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital's Deputy Director of Severe Medicine Zhong Ming, were immediately informed to go to Wuhan.
6南六楼“怎么样是错误的治疗方案？”“没有救过来。
"What's the wrong treatment plan for the sixth floor?" "No help.
”钟鸣说。
"said the bell.
金银潭将南六楼也改造成了ICU。
Gold and Silver Pool transformed the sixth floor of the south into ICU.
姜利来此一个月，慢慢明白能坚持活下来的病人走过了一条怎样的路线。
Jiang Li came here for a month, slowly understand the patient who can persevere to survive what kind of a route.
“最初，那些低氧患者就像一个人往悬崖上走，路一直是平的，向前走的时候他看不到悬崖，医生也看不到。
"Initially, the hypoxia patients were walking on a cliff. The road was always level. He could not see the cliff as he walked along, neither did the doctor.
等医生反应过来，他一只脚已经掉下去了。
By the time the doctor responded, one of his feet had fallen.
”姜利说。
'she said.
二十天，接触了最多死亡病例的医生们终于能看清前面多远是悬崖，知道再这么走会掉下去。
For 20 days, doctors who had been in contact with the largest number of deaths were able to see just how far ahead was a cliff, knowing it would fall.
“但只是了解它的发生、发展，还没能够学会迅速阻断某个环节的进展。
"But just understanding how it happens and develops hasn't learned how to block progress quickly.
作为医生，我们目前只能监控着他往前走，判断他快要掉下去的时候，把他往上托一托，看看能不能托住，也许有些人就托住了。
As doctors, we can only monitor his progress, judge that he is about to fall, lift him up, and see if we can hold him, and perhaps some will hold him.
”姜利说。
'she said.
在南六楼，钟鸣僵持最久的一个病人，插管时间超过一个月。
On the sixth floor, the longest-standing patient, Zhong Ming, was intubated for more than a month.
在钟鸣看来，无创呼吸的病人还需依靠自身努力，上了有创呼吸的病人就完全在医生手上。
In Bell's view, non-invasive breathing patients have to rely on their own efforts, the patients on invasive breathing is entirely in the hands of doctors.
在新冠肺炎的病情中，肌体与病毒的战役三周定生死。
In the case of New Crown Pneumonia, the battle between the body and the virus is a three-week battle for life and death.
“理论上，这个病人已经在和病毒的斗争中生存下来了，但是之前的打击对他太大了。
"Theoretically, the patient has survived the fight against the virus, but the previous blow was too much for him.
”钟鸣说。
"said the bell.
钟鸣不愿说得过于详细，但他透露如今这个时候，在金银潭的ICU，有很多现实的问题阻碍了病人的恢复，“跟我们平时在病房里进入康复的病人是不一样的。
Zhong didn't want to go into too much detail, but he revealed that at this point in time, in the ICU of the gold and silver pool, there are many real problems impeding the recovery of the patient.
”可能是人手的不足。
Perhaps it was a shortage of hands.
南六层二十多个病床，医护人员加起来约四十人，而ICU的标准医护比为0.5-1个医生和3个护士对一个病人。
There are more than 20 beds on the sixth floor, with a combined staff of about 40, while the ICU standard ratio is 0.5 to 1 doctor and three nurses to one patient.
也可能是因为防护仍不够到位，除了南七楼ICU，金银潭新增的另外四个ICU病区，每个病区只配有两个正压呼吸式头套。
It may also be that protection is still not in place, with the exception of ICU on the seventh floor and four additional ICU areas in the Gold and Silver Pool, each with only two positive pressure breathing caps.
面对这样的烈性传染病，没有足够强力的防护装备，医护人员无法被保障全然安全地进行吸痰等近距离护理。
In the face of such a strong infectious disease, there is no strong enough protective equipment, health care personnel can not be fully safe to conduct sputum suction and other close care.
接受采访时，钟鸣并不知道这位插管超过一个月的病人是否能够康复。
At the time of the interview, Zhong did not know whether the patient, who had been intubated for more than a month, would recover.
新冠病毒除了对肺部攻击，还会对心脏和肾脏造成影响，若是有基础疾病或年岁已高，则会引起全身多器官衰竭。
In addition to attacking the lungs, the virus can affect the heart and kidneys, causing multiple organ failure throughout the body in the event of a basic illness or advanced age.
你能感觉到钟鸣的急迫。
You can feel the urgency of the clock.
中山医院的同事说他偏爱完美，做事拼命。
Colleagues at Zhongshan Hospital say he favors perfection and hard work.
ICU医生不惮面对死亡，对他们造成冲击的是意料之外的死亡。
Dr. ICU is not afraid of death, and it is unexpected death that strikes them.
“有大量病人在短时间内离去，每一个病人的离去，我们都直接或者间接目睹了一个家庭的悲剧，其实这个对我们的打击比任何时候都要大。
"With so many patients leaving in a short time, and with every patient gone, we have witnessed, directly or indirectly, the tragedy of a family that has hit us harder than ever.
我们也算是身经百战，见惯生死，但这次真的不太一样。
We are used to life and death, but this is different.
”钟鸣说。
"said the bell.
采访中，不同医院的医生描述过相似的突然死亡：上午还是清醒的，晚上突然去世；一个晚上去世四个病人，一边抢救一边目睹下一个的死亡；医生查房结束，认为一切都好，脱下防护服时，身后一台心电监护仪直了。
Doctors in different hospitals have described similar sudden deaths: waking up in the morning and dying suddenly in the evening; four patients dying one night while rescuing and witnessing the death of the next; and doctors checking the room to see that everything was going well.
对于有些危重症患者来说，死亡不是一个缓慢的过程，可能只是一瞬间。
For some critically ill patients, death is not a slow process. It can be a flash.
有时候感觉突然被卡住了喉咙，再也喘不上最后一口气，有时候突然陷入昏迷，不同器官上受伤细胞再也无法坚持工作，在临界点崩塌。
Sometimes it feels like I'm stuck in my throat, I can't breathe for the last breath, and sometimes I fall into a coma, where injured cells from different organs can no longer work and collapse at the tipping point.
一瞬间死亡，这不是ICU医生允许发生的事情。
Death in a split second. That's not what dr. ICU allowed.
他们希望自己明确地知道每个病人在每个病情阶段应该怎么处理，然后尽量托住。
They want to know exactly what each patient should do at each stage of their illness and try to hold on to it.
我们从侧面获知，姜利和钟鸣初期接手的二十余名病人，没有一位康复。
We learned from profile that none of the twenty patients Jiang Li and Zhong Ming inherited had recovered.
姜利和钟鸣都记得每一个病人。
Jiang Li and Zhong Ming remember every patient.
“这些病人给我印象都很深，让我知道我要重新学习，重新开始，过去的经验可能都不管用。
"These patients have impressed me so much that I know I have to relearn and start over, and past experiences may not work.
我对每个病人都要非常谨慎小心，因为它可能完全不在你的掌控之中。
I have to be very careful with each patient, because it may not be under your control at all.
我不再像以前一样，能给出每个病人非常正确的治疗方法。
I'm not able to give every patient the correct treatment, as I used to.
”钟鸣说。
"said the bell.
“治疗方法会有对错之分吗？”“会。
Is there a right or a wrong treatment? Yes.
你不知道正确与否，都有可能是错误的。
You may be wrong if you don't know whether you are right or not.
”钟鸣说。
"said the bell.
比如结束无创开启有创的时间点，可能就会出错。
For example, ending a non-invasive start to a traumatic point in time can be a mistake.
“怎么样是错误的治疗方案？”“没有救过来。
"What is the wrong treatment plan?" "There was no salvation.
”钟鸣说。
"said the bell.
坦白说，早期送到金银潭ICU的病人往往让医生感到被动。
Frankly speaking, the early arrival of ICU patients often made doctors feel passive.
因为延误治疗，病人送至金银潭时，病程已经加速，进入末期。
As a result of the delay in treatment, the patient was sent to the gold and silver pool.
“金银潭床位开放，别的都想把重症转过来，在运转途中你一个氧气跟不上，一到金银潭就重了，就是神仙他也没有什么好办法。
"The gold and silver beds are open, and everything else wants to turn the serious illness around. When you run out of oxygen you can't keep up.
”一位ICU医生说。
'said an ICU doctor.
另一位医生则直接形容疫情前期，转院金银潭“恨不得半个死人就过来了”。
Another doctor directly described the epidemic in the pre-hospital transfer gold and silver pool "half a dead person would like to come."
医生都尽力了，这点毋庸置疑。
The doctors did their best, no doubt about it.
没有医生在主观上会做错什么，但人类认识疾病的道路，代价就是一条一条生命。
No doctor can do anything wrong subjectively, but the price of human understanding of disease is a life.
这条“用很多病人死亡经验堆出来”的路，如今，房明浩喋喋不休向没有接触到大量危重病人的同仁们介绍。
The road, "piled up with the death experience of many patients," is now being introduced by Mr Fang to colleagues who have not come into contact with a large number of critically ill people.
为的是不让他们回到自己初到金银潭的日子，“收一堆病人，犹豫一下，人就没了”。
In order to prevent them from returning to their first day in the gold and silver pool, "a pile of patients, hesitated, people are gone."
7重组相比整建制医疗队，由各地、各科专家组成的病区里，也可能因为经验和习惯产生分歧。
The reorganization may also be due to differences in experience and habits in the sick zone, which is made up of experts from various regions and sections, as opposed to full formed medical teams.
今天的金银潭是一个由全国顶尖医疗力量组成的战场。
Today's Gold and Silver Pool is a battleground of the nation's top medical forces.
最早抵达金银潭的全国专家们，如姜利、钟鸣等在四十多天前进驻了南五、南六和南七楼的ICU，另有调配五名来自长沙湘雅医院的“高年资”ICU护士支援。
The first experts from around the country, such as Jiang Li and Zhong Ming, moved into ICU on the 5th, 6th and 7th floors of the South China Sea more than 40 days ago. Five "senior" ICU nurses from Changsha Xiangya Hospital were deployed.
多数病区，则由来自安徽、河南、广东以及湖北等地近三百名医护和金银潭本院的八百多名医护组成。
Most of the affected areas are made up of nearly 300 medical staff from Anhui, Henan, Guangdong and Hubei provinces, and more than 800 medical personnel from the hospital.
除此之外，金银潭目前有整建制接管五个病区的上海第一批医疗队、福建第一批医疗队和国家中医医疗队。
Besides, the gold and silver pool now has the first medical teams from Shanghai, Fujian and the National Medical Team of Traditional Chinese Medicine.
其中，各有一百四十人左右的上海医疗队和陆军军医大学医疗队在年三十抵达，是最早进驻武汉的外省医疗力量。
About 140 medical teams from the Shanghai Medical Corps and the Army Medical University arrived in Wuhan in the 30th year, making them the first provincial medical teams to enter Wuhan.
后者在火神山建成后转出，由福建医疗队接管其病区。
The latter was transferred out of Mount Huoshen and was taken over by the Fujian medical team.
上海第一批医疗队主要由呼吸科、重症医学科、感染科和急诊医学科四部分力量组成，他们接手了北二楼，并将北三楼改造成ICU病区。
The first medical teams in Shanghai, made up of four main departments: respiration, severe medicine, infection and emergency medicine, took over the second floor of the north and transformed the third floor into an ICU area.
这是一个巨大的挑战，上海队队长郑军华坦言，“接下ICU的风险是很大的，但后来想想，既然是上海出来的，就要勇于挑重担。
It was a huge challenge, admits Shanghai captain Zhengjunhua. "The risk of taking on the ICU is great, but later on, since it was Shanghai, we had to bear the heavy burden.
”最初一周，上海队重新学习、适应一个与以往完全不同的诊疗流程，病历系统怎么使用，检验、转病区、领取设备、物资供应等流程怎么走等等。
For the first week, the Shanghai team relearned and adapted to a completely different process of diagnosis and treatment, how to use the medical records system, how to examine, turn the sick zone, receive equipment, provide supplies and so on.
从普通病区到三区合分的传染病区，工作流程也需要重新梳理。
From the common disease area to the three areas of the joint infectious disease area, the workflow needs to be re-combed.
医护人员零感染是队内的第一要求，郑军华说，“我做院长13年，从未采用过如此高等级的感控防护措施。
"I have been dean for 13 years and I have never used such a high level of sensibility protection," said Zheng.
”初期，上海队碰到了不少困难，比如对重症治疗的摸索；又比如对病人情绪的妥善管理。
In the early days, the Shanghai team encountered difficulties such as groping for serious medical treatment and managing patients' emotions well.
而他们解决的第一个问题，就是不断向国家和省市反映，改善金银潭的供氧系统。
The first problem they solved was to constantly report to the state and the provinces and municipalities to improve the oxygen supply system in the gold and silver pools.
当时，上海队的病区里，使用呼吸机的病人就有三十几个。
At the time, there were more than thirty patients using respirators in the Shanghai team's sick area.
金银潭从未收治过如此多的重症病人，原有氧量不仅不够，还会在每天深夜十二点和早上七点左右，突然掉氧。
Gold and Silver Pool has never treated so many seriously ill patients. Not only is the original oxygen amount inadequate, but it will suddenly fall out of oxygen around midnight and seven in the morning.
