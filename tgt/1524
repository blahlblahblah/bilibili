澎湃新闻记者 邓雅菲 实习生 苏笑语“在支援湖北行前工作能力摸底时，我得知队友几乎都是有十几年ICU经验的主管护师，而我，除去三个月试用期，正式工龄才两个月，我能胜任紧张的一线工作吗？”飞往武汉的专机上，江西省赣州市南康区第一人民医院ICU男护士、江西援鄂医疗队成员蒋孔明内心忐忑不安。
"In support of Hubei travel before the work capacity mapping, I learned that almost all of my teammates have more than 10 years of ICU experience, and I, excluding three months probation, formal service only two months, can be competent to do the intensive frontline work?
1月26日，大学刚刚毕业、正式工龄仅两个月的25岁ICU护士蒋孔明怀着一腔热血主动报名参加江西援鄂医疗队，前往武汉的抗疫一线。
On January 26, Jiang Kongming, a 25-year-old ICU nurse who had just graduated from college and had only two months of formal service, volunteered to join the Jiangxi medical team to fight the epidemic in Wuhan.
蒋孔明说，因为自己是新人，临床经验比较少，在武汉的抗疫一线特别担心会拖同事们的后腿，所以想尽自己最大的能力，多帮大家做一点事情，减轻大家的负担。
Jiang said that because he was a newcomer and had little clinical experience, he was especially worried about dragging his colleagues back in the battle against the epidemic in Wuhan.
除了完成一线的本职护理工作，他还利用休息时间帮70多位医务人员理发。
In addition to his first line of in-house care, he helped more than 70 medical staff to have their hair cut during his break.
到达武汉一线后，为了降低感染风险，医疗队的成员们都决定将头发剪短，但武汉街头大大小小的理发店已经全部停业。
After arriving in Wuhan, members of the medical team decided to cut their hair short to reduce the risk of infection, but all the barber shops in Wuhan, large and small, have closed down.
在大家一筹莫展时，蒋孔明自告奋勇帮大家剪发，“tony蒋”的名号渐渐传了开来。
When everyone was at a loss, Jiang Kongming volunteered to help cut their hair. The name "Tony Jiang" gradually spread.
“在赣州市南康区第一人民医院ICU工作时，我有过几次帮看护的病人理发的经历，这次我就自告奋勇帮大家剪发。
"While working at ICU of the First People's Hospital in Nankang District of Ganzhou City, I had several haircuts for nursing patients.
给第一个同事剪完后，发型丑得大家都笑了，但随着我的手艺越来越熟练，大家都说‘tony蒋’以后可以改行了……因为一直理发，我右手中指第二关节处有一个已经破溃的水泡。
After I finished cutting my first co-worker, the haircut was so ugly that everyone laughed, but as I became more proficient, everyone said, 'Tony Chiang' could change his haircut later... because of my constant haircut, there was a broken blister at the second joint of my right middle finger.
”2月16日，蒋孔明告诉澎湃新闻（www.thepaper.cn）。
Jiang told the surging news on Feb. 16 (www.thepaper.cn).
奋战在武汉抗疫一线的二十余天里，蒋孔明从刚刚踏出校园的一名“新人”，迅速成长为“火线”上一名合格的“战疫者”。
During the first 20 days of fighting against the epidemic in Wuhan, Jiang Kongming quickly developed from being a newcomer on campus to becoming a qualified "war blight."
准备为医疗队友剪发的蒋孔明。

本文图片均由受访者提供【蒋孔明的口述】毅然踏上抗疫一线的一名“新人”2019年7月，我从赣南医学院护理学急危重症专业毕业后，在赣州市南康区第一人民医院工作，是一名ICU护士。
In July 2019, I graduated from Gannan Medical School in Nankang District and worked as an ICU nurse at the First People's Hospital of Nankang District of Ganzhou City.
在前往抗疫一线的时候，除去医院三个月的试用期，我的正式工龄只有两个月。
When I went to the frontline of the epidemic, except for a three-month probationary period at the hospital, my official service was only two months.
今年大年初二，1月26日，我带着刚刚毕业的懵懂，满怀着一腔热血，报名参加了江西援鄂医疗队，走之前我谁也没有告诉，谁也不敢告诉。
On January 26 this year, I entered the medical team in Jiangxi province with my newly graduated students, ignorant and full of blood. I didn't tell anyone or anyone before I left.
大年初三，在飞往武汉的前一刻，妈妈打来电话问，“你在哪？”我还没回答，她已经哭成了泪人。
On the third day of the New Year, before flying to Wuhan, my mother called and asked, "Where are you?" I did not answer, she has cried into tears.
开弓没有回头箭，在母亲千叮咛万嘱咐之后，我登上了飞往武汉的专机。
The bow did not turn back, and after mother had spoken words, I boarded the special plane to Wuhan.
在飞机上，我的内心很忐忑，在行前工作能力摸底时，我得知队友几乎都是有十几年ICU经验的主管护师，而我，加上三个月的试用期，一共才工作五个月啊！我能胜任紧张的一线工作吗？但我随即给自己加油打气，告诉自己，我毕业于专业院校，学校里还有十个月的实习经历，早已能胜任ICU的大部分工作。
On the plane, my heart was perturbed, in the pre-working ability to map out, I learned that almost all of my teammates have more than a decade of ICU experience, and I, together with a three-month probation, work five months!
就这样，我前往了武汉市第五医院，开始了我的战“疫”工作。
In this way, I went to Wuhan Fifth Hospital, began my war "epidemic" work.
成为医疗队的理发“tony蒋”刚到武汉没几天，大家在培训的时候发现，穿脱防护服、戴帽子时，不管怎么弄都有长头发掉下来。
Just days after arriving in Wuhan, the medical team's hairdresser, Tony Jiang, found that long hair had fallen from his head while wearing protective clothing and a hat.
于是为了方便日常打理，也为了减少感染的风险，队员们商量着想把头发剪短。
So to make it easier to take care of themselves and to reduce the risk of infection, the team decided to cut their hair short.
奈何昔日繁华的武汉街头早已了无人烟，哪还有什么理发店。
The bustling streets of Wuhan in the past have long been empty, where there is no barber shop.
工作中我照顾过一些长期住在ICU的病人，由于他们的家属不能进来探视，病人头发长了就需要把头发剪短。
At work I took care of long-term ICU patients who needed to have their hair cut short because their families could not come in to visit them.
五个月前，我一到医院上班就开展了给病人理发的这项服务。
Five months ago, as soon as I arrived at the hospital, I started this service to give my patients a haircut.
因为有相关经验，于是我毛遂自荐，给队友们把头发剪短。
As I had relevant experience, I introduced myself and cut my hair short for my teammates.
蒋孔明为队友剪发。
Jiang Kongming cut his hair for his teammates.
面对自己的第一个顾客，内心还是是很紧张的，压力也很大，毕竟以前大家都是到专业的理发店，找专业的“Tony老师”理发，而我自己的理发水平毫无技术可言。
After all, everyone used to go to a professional barber shop to get a haircut from a professional Tony, and my own haircut was no skill at all.
当时没有工具，就找酒店借了一把大剪刀；没有披肩，就用练操作时穿的隔离衣。
There were no tools, so I borrowed a pair of scissors from the hotel. Without the shawl, I used the paraphernalia I wore during practice.
第一位找我剪发的是一位“女战友”，她的要求是：把头发剪短，尽可能的短，但是剪完后还可以用皮筋绑起来。
The first person to ask for a haircut was a "female comrade-in-arms" who asked that her hair be cut short and as short as possible, but then tied with a leather band.
我一开始不敢剪，“女战友”却一再鼓励我说：“没事，你剪吧，没啥要求，就是短一点，戴帽子的时候头发不会露出来。
At first I didn't dare to cut it, but the "comrade-in-arms" kept encouraging me to say, "It's all right, you cut it.
丑一点没关系，只要能减少感染的机会，能平安回家，就可以了。
Ugly a little all right, as long as can reduce the chance of infection, can go home safely, can be.
”再三询问、确认后，我才敢动手。
"I didn't dare to do it again and again until I had made sure.
第一个的效果也是意料之中，真的好丑——马尾长短不一，剪的太短了一些。
The first effect is also expected, really ugly - horse tail length, cut a little too short.
大家看到都笑了起来，紧张的工作气氛也稍微轻松了一点。
Everyone saw it and laughed, and the tense working atmosphere relaxed a little.
虽然“女战友”有些无奈，但是她也很理解，还不停鼓励我。
Although "female comrade-in-arms" has some helplessness, but she also very understanding, still keep encouraging me.
后来在大家的帮助下，找到了解决的办法：就是把头发扎起来再剪！这样会平整好多，也更好看。
Later, with the help of everyone, we found a solution: the hair is tied up again cut! This will be much more flat, better looking.
过了几天，有同事带来了电动理发刀，剪发的速度就大大加快了。
After a few days, a colleague brought an electric haircut knife, the speed of hair-cutting has been greatly accelerated.
给男同志剪发相对来说更简单，只要求短！不到10分钟，一个标准的4毫米板寸就能“一推而就”。
Haircuts for gay men are relatively simple and require only a short haircut. A standard 4-millimetre board can be "nudged" in less than 10 minutes.
有些女队友想剪男士寸头，但又下不了决心，我就会折中一下，给她剪一个男士短发，先用大剪刀剪短长头发，再用电动理发刀慢慢修。
Some female teammates want to cut a man's hair, but I can not make up my mind, I will cut her a man short hair, first with a pair of scissors short long hair, then electric haircut knife repair slowly.
蒋孔明的剪发“装备”。
Jiang Kongming's "equipment" for haircutting.
就这样，为几个队友剪了发之后，大家渐渐都来找我帮他们理发。
In this way, after a few teammates cut hair, people gradually came to me to help them haircut.
大家都热情高涨，格外地信任我，自觉的地排起了队等待理发，还称呼我为“tony蒋”。
Everyone was enthusiastic, trusting me a lot, standing in line for a haircut and calling me Tony Chiang.
剪完头发的“战友”会协助我一起剪，还有“战友”主动提供吹风机。
Hair-clipping "comrade-in-arms" will help me cut together, and "comrade-in-arms" offered to provide hair dryers.
慢慢地，我的技术也有了提高，队友们纷纷对我竖起大拇指，还开玩笑说，以后我可以改行了，剪完头发后还要求和我合影。
Slowly, my skills improved, and my teammates gave me thumbs up and joked that I could change course and ask to take a picture with me after I had my hair cut.
印象很深刻的是一位女队员，她犹豫了很久要不要剪寸头。
Impressed is a female member of the team, she hesitated for a long time whether to cut short.
排队轮到她的时候，她说，“你们先剪吧，我再等一下。
When it was her turn, she said, "Cut it first. I'll wait a little longer.
”又轮到她的时候，她还是想再等一下。
"When it was her turn again, she wanted to wait a little longer.
但是到了最后，她还是下定了决心。
At last, however, she made up her mind.
开始剪之后，我把第一缕头发放在她手上，想给她留作纪念，那时候她就哭了。
When I started cutting it, I put the first strand of hair on her hand to save her as a memento, and she began to cry.
我想，每一位“女战友”平时都是爱美的普通女孩，而因为这次疫情，她们才变成了无坚不摧的“战士”。
I think, each "female comrade-in-arms" is usually love the ordinary girl, and because of this outbreak, they have become invincible "fighters.
理发、工作两不误，不取得最后胜利绝不撤退迄今为止，我一共帮七十多位“战友”剪了头发。
A haircut, a job, no retreat. So far, I've cut the hair of more than 70 of my comrades-in-arms.
比较繁忙的时候是在前往一线的前两天。
The busier times were the first two days before heading to the front.
头一天剪到晚上十点钟才休息，最多的一天，剪了有三十多位。
The first day was cut until ten o'clock in the evening, the most a day, cut more than thirty.
因为长时间、高强度的理发工作，我的右手中指都磨出了水泡。
My right middle finger was all blistered from a long, intense haircut.
这项工作一直没有停止，因为随着时间的推移，我们已经来武汉半个多月，第一批理发的“战友”头发又慢慢长了起来，隔三差五就有人找我理发。
This work has not stopped, because with the passage of time, we have come to Wuhan more than half a month, the first haircut "comrade-in-arms" hair slowly grew up, every three or five years someone looked for my haircut.

在一线工作这段时间，我每天按时按点到重症监护室上班，为重症病人进行护理，包括治疗、生活护理、心理护理等等。
During my frontline work, I went to the intensive care unit regularly and punctually every day to provide care for serious patients, including treatment, life care, psychological care, etc.
刚到武汉的时候，在完全陌生的环境下需要马上投入工作，第一次上岗就全权负责接管病人。
When I first arrived in Wuhan, I had to start work immediately in a completely new environment. I was in charge of taking over the patients from my first job.
没有护士长带我们提前熟悉环境，更没有老师带教。
No head nurse took us to familiarize ourselves with the environment in advance, and no teachers to teach us.
之前坚守岗位近一个月的武汉的医务人员都已经太累了，他们才是真正的英雄，是我们来晚了。
The medical staff in Wuhan, who had been on duty for nearly a month, were tired. They were the real heroes.
不知不觉，距离出征的日子已经过去半个月，ICU的工作也慢慢熟知于心。
Unconsciously, half a month has passed since the start of the war, and the work of the ICU slowly became familiar with the mind.
现在我不仅能够把自己班上的事情做好，还能够清清楚楚的把病人交接给下一班。
Now I can not only do well in my class, but I can also clearly transfer patients to the next class.
每次下了班，我都会与母亲通电话。
Every time I leave work, I talk to my mother on the phone.
母亲问，“什么时候能回来呀？”我说：“快啦快啦，再有个半个月，我就回来了。
"When will you be back?" I said, "Soon, in half a month, I'll be back.
”我每天都这样安慰着她，但自己心里却深知：抗疫任重道远，不取得最后胜利绝不撤退。
I consoled her every day, but I knew full well that the battle against the plague would be a long one, and that it would never recede without final victory.
