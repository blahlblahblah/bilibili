记者/佟晓宇 韩谦 实习记者/胡琪琛 陈威敬编辑/刘汨  图片来源/ 澎湃新闻 胡琪琛1月23日上午，即将关闭进站口的汉口火车站除夕夜，我们和五个还在武汉的人聊了聊，听他们讲述了自出城交通关闭之后，两天两夜所经历的种种。
Reporter / Tong Xiaoyu Han Qian intern reporter / editor of Chen Weijing Chen / Liu gurgle news On January 23 morning, just before the closing of Hankou railway station entrance, we chatted with five people still in Wuhan and listened to their stories of the two days and nights since the closure of the city traffic.
每个人留下的理由都不一样，有的只是抱着“不想打搅别人”的念头，独自面对空荡荡的街道；有的是因为岗位需要，不想被看成“逃兵”；还有的刚刚回到故乡，一点都不后悔，认为“至少有爱的人在旁边”。
The reasons for leaving behind vary, ranging from thinking "don't want to disturb others" to facing empty streets alone, from not wanting to be seen as "deserters" because of the demands of their posts, to just returning home without remorse, thinking that "at least there are loved ones around."
当然也有些人，无论出城交通是否关闭，都无法离开。
There are, of course, people who cannot leave the city whether or not it is closed.
家人已经躺在发热门诊几天几夜，因为无法确诊，迟迟不能进入隔离病房。
The family has been lying in a fever clinic for several days and nights, unable to confirm and unable to enter the isolation ward.
相比来去的自由，他们更想得到一个安全有效的就医环境。
They want a safe and effective medical environment more than the freedom to come and go.
在这座城市关闭了大多数出口之后，紧随而至的春节，让留在这里的人们不管怎样还是想得到一声祝福，不说快乐，但求健康、平安。
After the city has closed most of its exits, the Spring Festival that follows lets the people who stay here want a blessing anyway, do not say happy, but seek health, peace.
武汉出城方向高速出现拥堵超市里排起长队抢购绿叶菜方亦原本就没打算离开武汉，但当23号早上看到主要出城交通方式被关闭的消息时，他还是有些慌了。
Wuhan high-speed out of the direction of the emergence of high-speed congestion supermarkets queue up to buy green leafy vegetables Fang did not originally intend to leave Wuhan, but when the 23 morning saw the main way out of the city traffic was closed, he was still a bit panic.
手机里的那条短信告诉方亦，这座城市通往外界的公共交通出口，即将在上午10点关闭。
The text message on the phone told Fang that the city's public transport exits to the outside world would be closed at 10 a.m.
紧接着，新闻又推送了一条消息，武汉市新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎患者，人数再次上升。
Immediately afterwards, the news sent a news, Wuhan City, a new coronavirus infection pneumonia, the number of people rose again.
在这之前，方亦就读的学校已经有了确诊病例，方亦没有住在为留校学生统一安排的宿舍里，而是选择和女朋友在外面租了间房子。
Before that, Fang had confirmed cases in his school and had not lived in a dormitory arranged for students to stay in school. Instead, he chose to rent a house outside with his girlfriend.
22号那天，他退掉了回恩施老家的火车票，“这时候不该出去打搅别人，就在这自行隔离吧。
On the 22nd, he gave up his train ticket to his hometown of Enshi. "It's not right to disturb others at this time.
”“封城”的消息公布后，辅导员让方亦想办法离开武汉城区，先去周边的地方，然后再转道离开。
After the announcement, the counselor asked Fang to leave Wuhan city, first to the surrounding area and then to turn away.
方亦也动了“走”的心思，他查了查去往武汉周边城市的车票，全卖完了。
Fang also moved the "go" mind, he looked up to Wuhan peripheral cities tickets, all sold out.
既然走不了，还得为后面的生活做准备。
Since can not walk, also must prepare for the later life.
早上八点多，方亦去租住地附近的超市买菜，距离出城交通关闭还有两个小时，每个收银台前都排起了长队。
At more than 8 am, Fang also went to the supermarket near the rental land to buy vegetables, two hours before the closure of the city traffic, each checkout in front of a long queue.
最受欢迎的是绿叶菜，货架很快空了，方亦身旁的人装满一车结了账后，回来又推了一车。
The most popular was leafy greens, the shelves were quickly empty, and the people next to Fang filled a load of bills and returned with a cart.
方亦自己只挑了耐放的土豆和花椰菜，还囤了些泡面。
Fang also picked only durable potatoes and broccoli, and hoarded some noodles.
除夕的晚上，方亦待在屋里哪也没去，他说自己独惯了，没有特意和家里联络。
On New Year's Eve Fang stayed in the house and did not go anywhere. He said he was used to being alone and did not want to make contact with his family.
但他还是按老家的习惯买好了一袋汤圆，准备初一煮给自己吃。
But he still bought a bag of soup Yuan according to the custom of his hometown, ready to cook it for himself.
武汉超市里选购蔬菜的人们隔着口罩，闻到消毒水的味道康康的妹妹是一名护士，工作的医院也负责收治发热病人，妹妹要一直上班到除夕。
Wuhan supermarket to buy vegetables people across the mask, smell the smell of disinfectant Kang Kang's sister is a nurse, the hospital is also responsible for treating febrile patients, sister to work until New Year's Eve.
康康和父母因此没有回陕西老家，陪妹妹一起留在武汉过年。
Kangkang and his parents therefore did not return home to Shaanxi Province, with his sister to stay in Wuhan for the New Year.
母亲看到视频里康康妹妹穿着防护服的样子，背地里抹了眼泪，转过头又跟妹妹说：“没关系，我们都支持你，还有那么多人在一线呢。
Her mother saw Kangkang sister wearing protective clothing in the video, secretly wiped tears, turned to her sister said: "Never mind, we are all supportive, there are so many people in the line.
”康康的父母在武汉开了家水果超市，几天前已经不敢出去进货了。
Kangkang's parents, who opened a fruit supermarket in Wuhan, were too scared to go out a few days ago.
他们停止了门店的对外营业，改成了在线上销售。
They stopped the store's external operations and switched to on-line sales.
他们在店门口放了个消毒过的箱子，水果装在里面，外卖员直接从箱子上取货。
They left a disinfectant box in front of the store, fruit inside, and the delivery man picked it up directly from the box.
23号早上5点40分，妹妹起床准备去医院上班，告诉了康康要出城交通关闭的消息。
At 5: 40 a.m. on the 23rd, my sister got up to go to the hospital and told Kang Kang that the city was going to be closed.
天亮以后，康康和母亲去超市买菜，同样看到了抢购的一幕，“菜基本上也是被哄抢的状态，人很多，短的队要排半个小时，长的要一个小时”。
After daybreak, Kangkang and his mother went to the supermarket to buy vegetables, also saw a panic-buying scene, "basically is also the state of looting, a lot of people, a short queue for half an hour, the length of an hour."
对于关闭出城交通的决定，康康表示理解，但她觉得消息来得有些突然，让人们没有适应的过程，像这样一窝蜂到了超市里，可能会造成更大人群聚集的风险。
Kangkang understood the decision to close the city, but felt the news had come suddenly, leaving people with no process of adjustment, and a rush into supermarkets like this could create the risk of a larger crowd gathering.
隔着口罩，康康闻到了消毒水的味道，也感受到了紧张，“所有人都想赶快买完东西，赶紧离开这里。
Through the mask, Kang smelled disinfectant and felt nervous. "Everyone wants to get out of here quickly."
”她碰见一个小女孩，好像是滞留在了武汉，在货柜旁急匆匆和家里人视频，请教怎么做饭，“不知道排骨怎么烧，只会烧素菜。
"She encountered a little girl, as if stranded in Wuhan, hurriedly next to the container and her family video, asking how to cook," I don't know how to cook the ribs, but only vegetarian dishes.
”在超市里，康康还遇到了两个没戴口罩的人，她很生气，上去质问，对方一脸茫然地看着她。
At the supermarket, Kang met two men without masks. She got angry, went up and asked, and looked at her blankly.
回去的路上，康康也看到了还有零星没戴口罩的人，大都是上了年纪的。
On the way back, Kangkang also saw sporadic cases of people not wearing masks, most of them elderly.
康康生气的原因在于，她认为所有人都该意识到戴口罩的重要。
The reason Kangkang is angry is that she thinks everyone should realize the importance of wearing a mask.
在康康学校附近的一个药店，买口罩的队伍排了有二三十个人，她准备在网上再买些口罩，选了武汉的地址后，显示着：“本地区不配送”。
At a drugstore near Kangkang School, a group of 20 or 30 people lined up to buy more masks online, picked up Wuhan's address and said: "This area is not distributed."
连续两天，康康都能收到很多亲友的信息，除了春节的问候，还有一层对她身处武汉特殊的关心。
For two days in a row, Kangkang can receive a lot of friends and relatives, in addition to the Spring Festival greetings, there is a special concern for her in Wuhan.
康康不大喜欢这种感觉，自己好像被当成了另类看待，“这让我压力更大了。
Kangkang didn't like the feeling and seemed to be treated differently. "It makes me more stressed.
”她尝试静下来看会书，但是总忍不住想关注最新的消息，朋友半开玩笑似的关心再次出现，“你现在别想什么学习的事了，吃好喝好，把免疫系统和循环系统调节好，就是最大的贡献”。
She tried to calm down and read the book, but could not help but try to keep track of the latest news, and her friend's half-joking concern reappeared.
康康家连续好几天一直都在吃素，“不敢吃肉，心里膈应”，除夕的年夜饭也没有肉。
Kang Kang family has been a vegetarian for several days, "dare not eat meat, diaphragm in the heart", New Year's Eve dinner also no meat.
赶上妹妹不值班，妈妈包了饺子。
When my sister was off duty, mother made dumplings.
吃饭时妈妈说，明年一定好好过个年。
Mother said at dinner that next year must be a good New Year.
康康偷偷许了愿望，“一切都赶紧好起来，可以自由自在的，想吃什么吃什么，想见谁就见谁”。
Kangkang secretly made a wish, "everything hurriedly good, can be free to eat what you want to eat, want to see who."
一些加油站开始排队下月产检的医院，在地图上被标红1月23号上午，胡杨也加入到了抢购的人潮中。
Some gas stations began queuing up for next month's exam, and on the morning of Jan. 23 Hu Yang joined the rush.
相比其他人，正在孕期的胡杨，在吃喝上更不能马虎。
Compared with other people, is pregnant euphrates poplar, in eating and drinking can not be sloppy.
胡杨的下次产检在2月28号，是一次排畸检查，如果这段时间不能检查，以后就查不出来了。
Hu Yang's next examination on February 28, is a teratogenic test, if this period of time can not check, will not be able to find out.
她有些担心，产检医院所在的位置患病人数不少，在一张统计图上，那个区域被标成了红色。
She had some concerns about the number of patients at the maternity ward, which was marked red on a chart.
胡杨听邻居说，同住的小区也有人感染了新型肺炎，她不能确定真假，每天大量的信息通过网络涌到她眼前，“现在已经分不清楚了什么是谣言，什么是真相了”。
Hu heard from her neighbors that someone in her neighborhood had contracted the new form of pneumonia. She couldn't be sure. Everyday a lot of information poured through the Internet to her.
不管外面的情势如何，胡杨家里已经立起了一些规矩：出门要带两层口罩，回来用洗手液洗手、淡盐水漱口，衣服裤子全挂在阳台上吹……胡杨和老公都是机场一线工作人员，往年的春节，两人大多在岗位上度过，每天的睡眠时间有限。
Regardless of the situation outside, the Hu Yang family has set up some rules: go out to wear a two-layer mask, come back wash hands with hand sanitizer, rinse with brine, and hang their trousers and clothes on the balcony... Hu Yang and her husband are front-line airport workers.
今年除夕两人也都排了班，因为怀孕，胡杨已经在家里休息了五天，家人担心她和孩子，每天都催她接着请假。
They were both scheduled for New Year's Eve this year because Hu Yang was pregnant and had been resting at home for five days. Fearing for her and her children, the family urged her to take leave every day.
运送物资的航班还要在武汉落地，空域也有航班经过。
Flights carrying supplies will also land in Wuhan, and there will be flights through the airspace.
胡杨离不开岗位，即便为了孩子，她也不好意思跟领导开口，“大家都在上班，我不想一个人当逃兵。
Hu Yang cannot leave his post, even for the sake of her children, she is ashamed to speak to the leadership, "Everyone is at work, I do not want to be a deserter alone.
”空空荡荡的街道穿上一次性塑料雨衣，当防护服除夕下午5点多，一直陪在在丈夫身边的刘萍走出了医院，去附近唯一还开着的饭馆吃了碗拉面，在这之前，一天里她只吃了一根黄瓜。
"Dressed in a disposable plastic raincoat on an empty street, Liu Ping walked out of the hospital with her husband at 5pm on New Year's Eve and ate only a cucumber before going to the only restaurant nearby where she still had noodles.
吃完饭，刘萍又回到住处给丈夫煮了颗鸡蛋，还带了些面包去医院。
After dinner, Liu Ping returned to her house and cooked an egg for her husband. She also took some bread to the hospital.
丈夫躺在病床上几天，只吃些干粮，刘萍担心他营养跟不上。
Her husband lay in his bed for a few days, eating only dry food, and Liping worried that he was undernourished.
前一天听到关闭出城交通的消息，刘萍没什么别的想法，她本来也不可能离开这里。
Liu Ping had no other idea when she heard the news of the city's closure the day before, and she could not have left.
丈夫王强在1月14日开始发烧，17日在武汉一家三甲医院拍胸片及CT，确诊为病毒性肺炎。
On January 14, husband Wang Qiang began a fever, 17 in Wuhan a triple A hospital chest film and CT, confirmed as viral pneumonia.
为了防止感染家里的老人和小孩，夫妻俩开始在外租房。
In order to prevent the infection of the elderly and children at home, the couple began to rent out.
在打了三天点滴后，王强仍然高烧38℃多，咳出的痰里还带着血。
After playing for three days, Wang Qiang still has a high fever of more than 38 degrees Celsius, coughing up sputum with blood.
21日，拨打120急救电话后，王强被送到一家发热门诊定点医院，在次日上午10点多住进了急诊病房。
21, after dialing 120 first-aid telephone, Wang Qiang was sent to a fever clinic booking hospital, the next morning at 10: 00 more into the emergency ward.
关闭出城交通后，刘萍唯一担心的是物资紧缺，她去附近超市买了些燕麦片、面包、泡面，还花150元买到了100个医用口罩，以及超市里的最后三件一次性塑料雨衣。
The only thing she worried about after the city closed was a shortage of supplies. She went to a nearby supermarket to buy oatmeal, bread, noodles, and bought 100 medical masks for 150 yuan, as well as the last three disposable plastic raincoats in the supermarket.
她觉得，没有防护服，穿着雨衣总比没有任何隔离要强。
She felt that it was better to wear a raincoat without protective clothing than without any isolation.
在刘萍提供的医院视频内，急诊室内病人未做任何隔离措施，陪护家属大多只佩戴一次性医用口罩。
In the hospital video provided by Liu Ping, emergency room patients did not do any isolation measures, most of the accompanying family members only wear disposable medical masks.
急诊室走廊的椅子上，坐满了输液的患者，再往前走一些，便是门诊大厅。
A chair in the emergency room hallway, full of patients with transfusions, went a little further and was the out-patient hall.
刘萍问过医生，丈夫什么时候能进入隔离病房，答复是，目前还在腾床。
Liu Ping asked the doctor when her husband would be admitted to the isolation ward and replied that he was still making his bed.
王强至今也未能确诊为此次的新型肺炎，“医生说他们没法做那个检测。
Wang Qiang has not been able to confirm the new pneumonia, "doctors said they could not do that test.
”刘萍已经10天没回家了，家里6岁的儿子和公公婆婆住在一起。
"Liu Ping has not been home for 10 days, and her six-year-old son lives with her mother-in-law.
在送丈夫就诊前，刘萍已经开始准备迎接春节，她早早打扫完房间，布置上了鲜花。
Before sending her husband to see a doctor, Liu Ping had begun to prepare for the Spring Festival. She cleaned the room early and arranged flowers.
按照往年的习惯，她还会让儿子写上一副对联贴在家里，“今年没能来得及”。
As is customary in previous years, she would have her son write a couplet at home, "Not in time for this year."
母亲和弟弟给刘萍打来电话，想过来看看她，“我不敢告诉他们我的住处，要是我被传染了，再传染给他们怎么办？”扔在地上的口罩刚结婚的哥哥，没有带嫂子回来整个寒假，周好一直在北京实习，武汉关闭出城交通的前一天，她回到了武汉市郊新洲的家里。
My mother and younger brother called Liu Ping and wanted to see her. "I'm afraid to tell them where I live, but if I get infected and infect them again?" The newly married brother threw a mask on the ground without his sister-in-law.
她说自己一点都不后悔，“即使真的有什么事，至少爱的人在旁边。
She said she didn't regret it at all. "Even if there was something, at least the one she loved was there.
”周好自己家里种了菜，在一个月前也已经囤够了年货。
Zhou had planted his own food and had stocked it up a month earlier.
按照以往的习俗，这一定是一个热闹的春节。
According to the old custom, this must be a busy Spring Festival.
除夕下午，爸爸就会带着周好和弟弟去贴对联、挂灯笼。
On New Year's Eve afternoon, Dad would take Zhou Hao and his younger brother to stick couplets and hang lanterns.
零点过后，必须挨家挨户上门拜年，越准时就越有诚意。
After midnight, you must pay a New Year call from door to door.
之后，整个家族看着春晚、吃着年夜饭，十几个人、十几道菜，周好和弟弟是家族里最小的，围着饭桌能收到一圈红包。
After that, the whole family watched the Spring Festival Gala, eating New Year's Eve dinner, a dozen people, a dozen dishes, Zhou Hai and his younger brother are the youngest in the family, around the table can receive a circle of red envelopes.
但今年除夕，这些情景都没出现，刚结婚的哥哥也没有带嫂子回来。
But this New Year's Eve, these scenes did not appear, the newly married brother did not bring his sister-in-law back.
从省内其它地方回家后，周好的表姐一直在洗澡，也明确说，不会来家里吃饭了。
Home from other parts of the province, Zhou good cousin has been bathing, also made it clear that will not come home for dinner.
周好定在初五的同学聚会同样泡汤了，听到武汉关闭出城交通的消息，一些在外地的同学立刻办理了退票。
Zhou Haoding in the fifth day of the same student gathering in the soup, heard Wuhan closed out of the city traffic news, some students in the field immediately processed refund.
周好的爸爸发了一条朋友圈，告知亲友今年不去拜年，也希望大家不要到家里来拜年了。
Zhou good father issued a circle of friends, told relatives and friends do not visit New Year, also hope that we do not visit home New Year.
周好把这条朋友圈发给了同学，很多人都跟着转发。
Zhou Hao sent the circle of friends to his classmates, and many of them followed suit.
除夕傍晚的时候，周好出门看了看，街上没什么人，除了一家香纸店，大多店铺都关了门。
On New Year's Eve, Zhou Hao went out to look, there was no one in the street, except for a perfume shop, most of the shops were closed.
在路边，周好看见，几个用过的口罩被丢在了地上。
