虽然我自己是公务员，但我客观地评价，在这次抗击疫情的过程中，我们国家的这台大的机器，在应对突发危机的时候，运转起来还是很不错的。
Although I am a civil servant myself, I objectively evaluate that in the course of this fight against the epidemic, our country's big machine, when responding to sudden crises, works very well.
口述 | 徐 理（化名）整理 | 周 洁我是一名普通的基层公务员，今年疫情发生后，被征调进入当地的指挥部协助工作。
Zhou Jie, an ordinary civil servant, was recruited into the local command post this year after the outbreak.
进入指挥部之前，我也一直以为政府是万能的，可以调动所有资源，但进了指挥部以后，我才知道，政府需要依靠群众的力量。
Before I entered the command post, I also thought that the government was omnipotent and could mobilize all its resources, but when I entered the command post, I realized that the government needed to rely on the power of the masses.
一个艰难的决定年三十中午，我们开了紧急会议，紧急到什么程度呢？我当时在家吃中饭，电话过来说要开会，意思是你饭先别吃了马上去，然后我什么都来不及带，第一时间赶到了开会的地方。
A Tough Decision At noon this year, we had an emergency meeting.I had lunch at home and called to say we were going to a meeting.
我们这里是一个旅游城市，所以征用了一个游客中心来开这个紧急会议。
We are a tourist city here, so a tourist center has been requisitioned for this emergency meeting.
当时我还不清楚疫情到了一个什么程度，也没有戴口罩。
At the time, I didn't know what the epidemic was like, nor was I wearing a mask.
当天我们讨论的重点是，是否要关闭全市的旅游场所，尤其是一些寺庙。
The focus of our discussion that day was whether to close down tourist sites throughout the city, especially some temples.
因为很多信众包括游客，都会在年三十的晚上和初一到寺庙里烧香祈福。
Because many believers, including tourists, will be in the New Year's Eve and the first day of the temple burning incense blessing.
这就依赖于指挥部对于疫情形势的研判，对于政府来说，既不能把一个大事当做小事办，把问题看轻了，也不能一点小事就大操大办，咋咋呼呼，掌握中间这个度其实是很困难的。
This depends on the command of the situation of the case, the Government can neither do a big thing as a trivial matter, the problem is underestimated, also can not do a small thing on the big deal, how can we master the middle degree is really very difficult.
而且，这也是一个艰难的决定，作为旅游城市，如果关闭旅游场所，经济势必要受到影响，而旅游场所一旦关闭，想要再起来难度很大；另一方面，在如此之短的时间里，如何做好景区的经营者、寺庙宗教界人士的思想工作还有广大信众和游客的劝说工作，也是考验工作能力的一环。
Moreover, it was a difficult decision for tourist cities to close tourist sites, which would inevitably have an impact on the economy, and once a tourist site was closed, it would be very difficult to get up again. On the other hand, in such a short period of time, how to do a good job of tour operators, temple and religious figures, as well as the persuasion of the general public and tourists, is also a test of working ability.
不得不说，我们的指挥部还是很果敢的，会议决定，马上暂时关闭各大旅游场所，同时做好宣传工作，让尽可能多的人知道这个消息，指挥部还安排了一批人手在各大景区，对那些不知情况来到景点的游客做相应的解释工作，在我看来，这么短的时间里，指挥部的各项决定和安排已经非常细致了。
I have to say, our headquarters is still very bold, the meeting decided to close the major tourist sites immediately, and publicity work to let as many people as possible know the news, the command also arranged a group of people in the major scenic spots to do the corresponding interpretation of the tourists who do not know the circumstances, in such a short time, the command decisions and arrangements have been very detailed.
现在再回过头来看这个决定，真的是太英明了。
It would be very wise to look back now at this decision.
如果我们当天没有把旅游景区关闭，那么势必就会导致很多游客、信众聚集，后果不堪设想。
If we did not close the tourist attractions that day, it will inevitably lead to a large number of tourists, believers congregate, the consequences are unthinkable.
这个决定也受到了老百姓的肯定。
This decision has also been confirmed by the people.
有一天我叫滴滴的时候，司机不知道我是政府公职人员，但我们聊着聊着聊到这个事情，他说这次我们政府做得不错，市里的确诊病例到现在都是3个，保持了很多天没有再新增，而且这3例都是输入型病例。
The other day when I was called dripping, the driver didn't know I was a government official, but we talked about it. He said our government had done a good job this time.
从别人的嘴里听到对政府的肯定，我的心里真的挺开心的。
I was really happy to hear from someone else's mouth about the government's affirmation.
政府也不是万能的年初二的时候，我被正式调入指挥部，原因是我们指挥部物资全线告急，要求征集采购线索。
The government is not a panacea in the second year, I was officially transferred to the command headquarters, because our headquarters supplies are in urgent need of procurement clues.
我所在的单位平时跟外界的沟通比较多，于是就让我进入采购部，准确地说，是做一名志愿者，负责甄别一些采购的线索，推进采购的流程。
My unit usually communicate more with the outside world, so let me into the procurement department, to be precise, as a volunteer, responsible for screening some procurement clues, promoting the procurement process.
其实我跟很多人一样，之前以为政府是无所不能的，一个行政命令下去，怎么可能买不到口罩防护服呢？但真的参与到这个工作里来，我就理解了。
In fact, like many people, I thought that the government is omnipotent, under an executive order, how can you not buy respirators? But really involved in this work, I understand.
就我们市而言，我们本身是没有这些医疗物资的生产厂家的，而有生产厂家的当地政府，优先征用了厂家的物资，满足本地需要，我们就买不到医疗物资了。
As far as our city is concerned, we do not have the manufacturers of these medical supplies ourselves, and the local governments of the manufacturers give priority to requisitioning the materials from the manufacturers so as to meet local needs, so we won't be able to buy medical supplies.
我相信在这之前，指挥部已经动员了一切行政资源去采买，但是物资真的很紧缺，所以我才被征调，加入进来做这个海外的采购。
I believe the command had already mobilized all the administrative resources to procure it before then, but the supplies were so scarce that I was called in to join in the overseas purchase.
我也相信，这个问题很多跟我们一样的地级市或者县级市也都遇到了，所以遇到政府发布求助信息，大家不要第一时间质疑政府的能力，政府也不是万能的。
I also believe that many prefectural or county-level cities like ours have encountered this problem, so when the government issues help messages, people should not question the government's ability at first, and the government is not a panacea.
一开始我也吃不准我是不是能帮上忙，就把政府需要大家提供采购信息的帖子发到了朋友圈，结果很多人给我回复，令我既惊喜又感动。
At first I was not sure if I could be of any help. I posted the government's post on purchasing information to my friends. As a result, many people replied to me, making me both surprised and moved.
工作开展起来之后，我们还是遇到了不少困难。
After the work started, we still had a lot of difficulties.
首先就是我们对于国际采买并不熟悉，第二个我们不知道需要什么样的物资，第三个我们也不懂语言，另外我们对于航空海关、国际交付等等政策流程都不了解。
The first is that we are not familiar with international purchasing. The second is that we do not know what materials are needed. The third is that we do not know the language.
但这期间，很多很多人自发地加入到我们的队伍里来。
But in the meantime, many, many people spontaneously joined our team.
我们还有一个群，说实话，群里很多人跟我都只是认识，或者是工作关系，并没有什么交情，但是当我发出了请求后，很多人给我提供线索，而且有些线索需要深挖跟进，他们又主动承担，继续追踪下去，很多不认识的人都在这个过程中成了志愿者，不断帮我们核实线索的真假、询价、报关的流程、航空公司的联络等等，还有文件的翻译，这些工作都是一些我并不认识的志愿者在默默承担，这个过程里我很多次都被感动到，我觉得不光是我在做这个事情，很多中国人都想在这个时候帮助自己的祖国、自己的家乡，让你觉得朋友无处不在。
We also have a group, to be honest, many people in the group only know me, or work relationship, and do not know each other, but when I send a request, many people give me clues, and some clues need to be followed up.
举一个例子，我们有一单美国的采购，已经联系好货物了，但是遇到物流的问题。
To take one example, we have a single US purchase that has been connected to the good goods, but encountered logistics problems.
如果按照普通的快递，到货起码要一个月以后了，所以需要另辟蹊径。
If according to the ordinary express, the arrival of the goods at least a month later, so need to find another way.
我们就找了几大航空公司的老总，其实我跟他们并不认识，联系方式也是辗转而来，但电话打过去，对方一听我们是这个事情，完全没有任何官腔，就算不能给予我们直接的帮助，也会想办法给我们提供别的渠道，告诉我们怎么办，尽力来促成这件事。
In fact, I don't know them and I can't get in touch with them, but when I call you, I don't have any official voice at all. Even if we can't give us direct help, we'll find other ways to tell us what to do and do our best to make it happen.
除了联系空运的班机之外，我们还需要找到人去当地工厂提货，直接送到机场。
In addition to connecting flights by air, we need to find someone to pick up the goods at the local factory and deliver them directly to the airport.
很幸运，我们找到了一个愿意帮助我们的当地人，可能是美籍华裔，他的身份我不清楚，但他甚至主动提出愿意承担工厂到机场之间的物流费用。
Luckily, we found a local man, probably of Chinese-American origin, who was willing to help us. I don't know who he was, but he even offered to pay for the logistics between the factory and the airport.
目前，这单货物已经在来的路上，希望它能顺利运到我们这里，交到医护人员的手中。
At present, the goods are on the way here, hope it can be delivered to us, into the hands of medical personnel.
当然了，海外采购并不都是那么顺利。
Of course, overseas procurement is not always easy.
粗略算算，大概我们收到了100条采购线索里，只有10条是有效的线索，再继续追踪下去，可能只有一单能成，甚至一单都成不了。
In a rough calculation, of the 100 purchase leads we received, only 10 were valid leads, and if we continued to track them down, perhaps only one or even one of them would fail.
我们有过很多次失败的采购，甚至到了最后一步被厂家跑单的也有，这个时候我们来不及沮丧和愤怒，也来不及追究背后的原因，因为我们急着寻找下一个新的可能。
We have had a lot of failed purchases, even to the last step by the manufacturers run the list, this time we do not have time to frustration and anger, nor to investigate the reasons behind it, because we are anxious to find a new possibility.
而在这个不断寻找，不断拥有希望又伴随着失望的过程里，我最想感谢的，还是这些默默无闻一直帮助我们的志愿者。
And in the constant search, the constant hope and the disappointment that accompanies it, it is these anonymous volunteers who have been helping us.
我们政府的工作人员日以继夜，努力工作，还可以说是使命担当，但志愿者是没有报酬纯粹出于本心的，很多次海外的消息过来，都是深夜，但每次我们把国外的材料发进群里，两个小时内马上就能收到翻译好的材料。
Our government workers work hard day and night, and it's a mission, but volunteers are unpaid purely for their own sake. A lot of news from overseas comes late at night, but every time we send material from abroad into the group, we get translated material in two hours.
经过这次事件，我觉得我们国家的志愿者精神真的有了很大的进步，我们的国民素质、爱国精神，我都真真切切地感受到了。
After this incident, I feel that the spirit of volunteerism in our country has really made great progress, our national quality, patriotism, I really feel.
最后，我也希望通过自己的经历告诉大家，虽然我自己是公务员，但我客观地评价，在这次抗击疫情的过程中，我们国家的这台大的机器，在应对突发危机的时候，运转起来还是很不错的。
In conclusion, I wish to tell you from my own experience that, although I am a civil servant, I objectively evaluate that this large machine of my country has worked well in responding to sudden crises in the course of the fight against the epidemic.
我看到每个人都在自己的岗位上发挥自己的作用，尤其是基层的工作人员，工作是非常辛苦的，并不是那种不知所措、不敢担当的无序状态。
I see that everyone plays their part in their positions, especially at the grass-roots level, where the work is very hard, not a disorderly state of confusion and indecision.
