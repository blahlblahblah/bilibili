“新冠病毒更可能像流感病毒一样，最终与人类共生，靠疫苗来预防控制。
"The new canopy virus is more likely to end up symbiotic with humans, relying on vaccines for prevention and control," he said.
”文 |管艺雯编辑 |宋玮杨功焕是中国疾病控制中心原副主任，多年的疾控系统工作，让这位退休老人对这场波及全世界的新冠病毒疫情始终保持着密切关注。
Mr. Song, a former deputy director of the China Centers for Disease Control, worked for years with the disease-control system, keeping the retired man closely informed about the new crown virus epidemic that has affected the world.
近日接受《财经》记者专访时杨功焕说，目前很多专家开始讨论人类和新冠病毒将会是一个什么样的关系，“是像SARS那样严格隔离控制，然后病毒消失；还是像流感病毒一样，毒力越来越弱化，最终与人类共生，靠疫苗来预防控制。
In a recent interview with Caijing, Yang said many experts are beginning to discuss what kind of relationship human beings and the new crown virus will be, "whether it is under strict quarantine control like SARS and then the virus disappears, or whether, like the flu virus, it is becoming less virulent and ultimately symbiotic with humans, with vaccines for prevention and control.
”“随着疫情的变化、对该病毒特点的进一步认识，今后更可能是第二种情况。
"The second scenario is more likely in the future as the epidemic evolves and the characteristics of the virus become better known.
”杨功焕认为，新冠病毒将更可能与人类长期共存。
Mr Young believes the new crown virus will be more likely to co-exist with humans in the long term.
迄今为止，人类真正消灭的传染病只有天花，它也是人类用科学方法消灭的唯一传染病。
So far, the only infectious disease truly eradicated by mankind is smallpox, which is also the only infectious disease eliminated by scientific methods.
而多数传染病病毒，学会了与人类共存，人们通过疫苗来预防控制它们，比如流感、麻疹、甲肝等。
Most infectious diseases, like influenza, measles, hepatitis A, have learned to live side by side with humans and are prevented by vaccines.
距离1月23日武汉封城已经近4周，武汉日新增确诊病例依然维持在四位数。
Almost four weeks after Wuhan was closed on January 23, the number of newly confirmed cases in Wuhan remains at four digits.
好消息是，湖北非武汉地区的新增自2月13日以来继续下降，国内非湖北地区新增病例2月17日已降至接近100以内。
The good news is that the number of new cases in non-Wuhan areas of Hubei province has continued to drop since February 13, and the number of new cases in non-Hubei areas fell to nearly 100 on February 17.
杨功焕强调，在当时的情况，如果（武汉及其他湖北城市）不“封城”，很可能就会引发全国性的疫情大暴发。
Yang stressed that in the circumstances, if (Wuhan and other Hubei cities) do not "seal the city," it is likely to trigger a nationwide outbreak.
她表示，湖北各市解除“封城”还没到时候。
She said Hubei cities to lift the "closure" has not yet been the time.
如果湖北省的日新增病例下降到两位数，“才有可能解除‘封城’。
If daily new cases fall to double digits in Hubei province, "it will be possible to lift the blockade."
”以下是杨功焕接受《财经》杂志专访的内容：《财经》：为什么新冠病毒在湖北的病死率会远高于其他省？杨功焕：我认为主要是因为湖北省的轻症病例发现得比其他地方少，这是个比例问题，轻症病例比较少，当然显示出来的病死率就高。
The following is an interview with Caijing magazine: "Why is the new-cap virus more likely to die in Hubei than in other provinces?" Yang: I think it's mainly because there are fewer cases of mild cases in Hubei Province than elsewhere.
流行病学经常说冰山现象，你发现的病例就像你在大海中看见冰山的顶，海面之下还有更大的冰山。
Epidemiology often refers to the phenomenon of icebergs. You find cases like the tip of an iceberg that you see in the sea.
轻症患者不可能100%都被发现，但除湖北之外的其他省市发现得多，可能发现了80%，轻症患者作为分母变大了，所以病死率就低；但是在湖北可能只发现了50%，所以它病死率就显得高——我认为主要原因在这。
Mild cases cannot be found in 100% of cases, but they are found more often in provinces and cities other than Hubei, where 80% may have been found, and where mild cases have become larger as denominators, the fatality rate is low; but perhaps only 50% have been found in Hubei, so it appears to be high - and I think that's the main reason.
最近中疾控在《中华流行病学》杂志上发了一篇文章，显示截至1月20日，有6174例患者发病（这是回顾性病例，他们的发病时间在1月20日之前，后被确诊）。
In a recent article in the Chinese Journal of Epidemiology, CDC reported 6,174 cases as of Jan. 20 (a retrospective case whose onset date was before Jan. 20 and later confirmed).
然而当时国家卫健委的官方通报显示，截至1月20日，全国累计确诊病例只有291例。
At the time, however, the official notification from the State Health Commission showed that as of January 20, only 291 cases had been confirmed nationwide.
发病病例的比例和报告率的数字是不一致的。
The rates of morbidity and reporting are inconsistent.
1月20号之前，那个时候病例发现率只有5%都不到。
By January 20, the case-finding rate was less than 5%.
所以你可以设想，那个时候你发现的都是重症，病死率当然就高了。
So you can assume that by that time what you find is severe, and the fatality rate is, of course, high.
《财经》：这是否意味着湖北真实确诊数字比现在高很多，但是真实致死率比现在公布的数据要低？杨功焕：我们无法说真实确诊数，只能称为报告的确诊病例数。
Caijing: Does this mean the number of confirmed cases in Hubei is much higher than it is now, but the real fatality rate is lower than the data released now?
也不能说真实病死率，我们的估计起源于中疾控昨天对7万病例的分析，6174是按发病日期计算的，291例是按传染病上报系统报告的病例数，因此我们推断：1月20日前病例发现率不到5%。
Nor can it be said that the true fatality rate, our estimates stem from the CDC's analysis of 70,000 cases yesterday, 6174 by date of onset, 291 cases reported by the Communicable Disease Reporting System, so we infer that the case detection rate before January 20 was less than 5%.
所以，湖北病死率高，与病例漏报比例高、发病率有重要关系，但不是唯一的关系。
Therefore, the high fatality rate in Hubei province is related to the high rate of underreporting and morbidity, but it is not the only one.
另外，病死率高的另外一个原因是，与湖北患者多，医疗资源紧缺，也有关系。
In addition, the high mortality rate is also due to more patients with Hubei, lack of medical resources, but also related.
《财经》：回头来看，“封城”这个决策是否应重新审视？尤其在毫无准备下的“封城”，某种程度上加剧了混乱和交叉感染。
Caijing: In retrospect, should the decision to "close the city" be re-examined? Especially in the unprepared "closed city," some degree of confusion and cross-infection.
杨功焕：此一时彼一时。
Mr. Yang: Time and tide wait for no man.
当时那个情况，如果你不封城，很可能就会引发全国性的大爆发。
That situation, if you do not close the city, is likely to trigger a national explosion.
《财经》：你认为整个湖北会在何时解除“封城”？杨功焕：湖北省的日新增病例要是下降到两位数，才有可能解除“封城”。
Caijing: When do you think the whole Hubei Province will be closed? Yang Gonghuan: If the number of new cases falls to double digits in Hubei Province, it will be possible to lift the "blockade."
现在日新增病例还在四位数，千例以上，我认为现在还不到时候。
With more than 1,000 new cases in four digits each day, I don't think it's time yet.
我还想说一点，不要简单说学习日本和新加坡的做法，即使达到一定条件解除“封城”了，也需要考虑到我们国家的医院系统存在一些固有的问题。
I would also like to say that, rather than simply following the example of Japan and Singapore, even if conditions are met for the "closure" to be lifted, we need to take into account some of the problems inherent in our national hospital system.
我们医疗资源的配置在不同级别的医院实际上是不够的，分级诊疗还存在很多问题。
The allocation of our medical resources in different levels of hospitals is not enough. There are still many problems in grading treatment.
当初大家有发烧，集中到大医院就诊，这个行动直接导致了新冠病毒的传播。
When people had a fever and concentrated in a major hospital, this action led directly to the spread of the new crown virus.
新加坡和日本的医疗资源，尤其在分级诊断这些方面的基础设施和我们国家是不可比的。
The medical resources of Singapore and Japan, especially in the hierarchical diagnosis of these aspects of the infrastructure and our country is incomparable.
中国整个分级诊疗的运行还在进一步的改进中，如果这些基本问题你没有解决，大家如果再集中到大医院去就诊，特别在病例数比较多的情况下，又会加大传播，那就会前功尽弃，所以（解封）要非常慎重。
If you don't solve these basic problems, if you go back to a major hospital to see a doctor, especially if the number of cases is too large and the spread will increase, you will lose your job, so be very careful.
《财经》：如何看其他省市的严格防控和部分村庄、城市小区的强制隔离措施，其中是否有不理性的地方？杨功焕：每个（地区）都是要根据现实情况来分析的。
Caijing: How to look at the strict control of other provinces and cities and the forcible isolation of some villages and urban areas, is there any irrationality?
如果连续10天上海、北京都是几例病例增加，当然它的经济活动、社会活动是可以增加的，我觉得现在是可以讨论改变的时候。
If there are a few more cases in Shanghai and Beijing in a row for 10 days, and of course its economic and social activities can be increased, I think it's time to talk about change.
新加坡和日本就是这么做的，他们目前的新增病例都是个位数或十几人，我认为每个地方根据实际情况来决定，在他们的情况下，选择的做法也符合他们所在地区疾病的流行情况。
This is what Singapore and Japan are doing, and their new cases are now in the tens or tens of individuals, and I think it's up to each place to decide, in their case, that the choice is consistent with the prevalence of the disease in their area.
《财经》：日本、新加坡的做法和国内不同，他们认为新冠肺炎靠隔离很难防止传播，所以不强制隔离，而是加强对高危人群的保护和准备更多的医疗资源。
Caijing: The Japanese and Singaporeans are different. They argue that isolation is difficult to prevent transmission, so instead of imposing isolation, they are strengthening the protection of high-risk groups and preparing more medical resources.
这是否对国内有一定借鉴意义？杨功焕：大家对新冠肺炎是不断认识的过程，开始武汉那么多的感染者，就算重症比率不高，但是感染者多了以后，重症的绝对数量还是不少，加上当时导致全国大流行的风险很高，所以当时的封城十分必要。
Yang Gonghuan: People are constantly aware of the new crown pneumonia, began to Wuhan so many infected people, even if the rate of serious illness is not high, but more infected, the absolute number of severe illness is still not small, coupled with the high risk of a national pandemic at that time, so the blockade was necessary.
但是随着病毒传播的时间比较长，病毒在多代传播后，毒力可能进一步弱化，轻症的比例很大，而且传染力度又特别强，有些只有几百分之一的传播可能性居然也有人受到了感染，所以针对这个病毒，要完全挡住不太可能。
But with the virus spreading over a longer period of time, the virus may become more virulent over generations, the prevalence of mild cases is very high, and transmission is particularly strong, and some as little as a hundredth of the probability of transmission has been infected, so it is unlikely that the virus will be completely stopped.
现在新加坡、日本的措施也是一种尝试。
Now Singapore, Japan's measures are also an attempt.
《财经》：北海道大学称在其跟踪的50多个案例中，差不多一半的案例是被无症状感染者所感染的。
Caijing: Hokkaido University says that in almost half of the more than 50 cases it follows, asymptomatic infections occur.
而有些日本官员认为，如果确诊者是没有症状的话，基本可以视为没有传染性。
Some Japanese officials believe the diagnosis is largely non-contagious if the person is asymptomatic.
上述截然相反的两种判断，你赞成哪一种？杨功焕：我目前无法判断，只有依据现在的报告来判断，但也不会依据一项单独的报道，目前我们对该病毒的认识还是有限的。
What do you think of the two diametrically opposed judgementsYang Gonghuan: I am not in a position to judge for the time being, but only on the basis of the present report, but not on the basis of a separate report.
因为有过少数的报告说没有症状也具备传染性，但是也承认这种比例并不是很高。
Because there have been a few reports of asymptomatic infectivity, it is acknowledged that the rate is not very high.
如果要把无症状的都视为有传染性，这种情况要采取的措施，和视为无传染性的措施可能完全不同。
If the asymptomatic is to be considered infectious, the measures to be taken in this case may be completely different from those considered non-contagious.
前者工作量要大很多，后者工作要简单一些，但是会有风险。
The former involves a much greater workload, while the latter works more simply but carries risks.
日本官员公开说确诊者无症状可视为没有传染性，这是一个权衡的结果。
Japanese officials said publicly that asymptomatic patients could be considered asymptomatic, a trade-off.
《财经》：有专家提出，新冠病毒是不可能像SARS一样被彻底消灭了，会长期伴随人类，你是否认可这个判断？杨功焕：现在国际上很多专家都开始讨论人类和新冠病毒是一个什么样的关系。
Caijing: Some experts suggest that the new crown virus is unlikely to be wiped out like SARS, and will accompany human beings for a long time.Do you agree with that assertion?
是像SARS那样我们把它隔离得很严格，把它控制住，然后病毒就消失了？还是像流感病毒一样，随着不断的传播，它的毒力会越来越弱化，它就会变成一个跟我们人类共生的一个病毒，以后只能靠疫苗来预防控制。
Is it the SARS virus that we isolate so tightly, we control it, and then the virus disappears or, like the influenza virus, it becomes less virulent as it spreads, becoming a symbiotic virus that can only be prevented and controlled by vaccines.
随着我们国家现在湖北省外的病例数越来越少，我们应该开始思考，是否采取类似新加坡的做法。
With fewer and fewer cases in our country now outside Hubei province, we should start thinking about whether to take a Singapore-like approach.
比如两周以后，或者一个月以后逐步不用那么严厉的封闭措施，而是强化常规的预防措施，包括随时戴口罩，人与人的距离比较远，学会如何咳嗽、打喷嚏，避免把飞沫传染给他人、勤洗手等，即使有一些感染，再出现一些病例也不用恐慌，慢慢形成这样一个过程。
For example, in two weeks, or a month later, instead of strict closures, we should step up regular preventive measures, including wearing masks at all times, keeping people away from people, learning how to cough and sneeze, avoiding foamy infections, washing your hands, etc., even if there are some infections, and some cases do not need panic.
《财经》：新冠会像SARS一样消失还是与人类共生，你的回答是？杨功焕：随着疫情的变化、对该病毒特点的进一步认识，今后更可能是第二种情况。
Caijing: Will the new crown disappear like SARS or become symbiotic with human beings? YEUNG Kwok-hwan: As the epidemic changes and there is a better understanding of the virus's characteristics, the second scenario is more likely in the future.
《财经》：你曾经多次对比本次和SARS时的疫情防控措施。
Caijing: You have compared the epidemic prevention and control measures with SARS many times.
今天来看，SARS之后建立的传染病直报系统为何没起作用？杨功焕：SARS爆发时，还没有建立直报系统，传染病的报告分级报告完成的，从传染病发生地到国家层面，了解疫情就会比较慢；SARS以后，国家投资建立了这么一个直报系统。
Today, why hasn't the post-SARS Communicable Disease Reporting System worked? Mr. Yang: When SARS broke out, there was no direct reporting system in place. Reporting of infectious diseases was done on a reporting scale, and knowledge of the epidemic was slower from the point of occurrence to the national level; after SARS, the state invested in a direct reporting system.
但这一次的疫情，是在开始的时候没有用，再好的系统你不用，那也没有作用。
But this time, the outbreak, is not useful at the beginning, no matter how good the system you do not use, that also has no effect.
