许多人把许鹏比作英雄，其实，从来就没有超级英雄，都是千万个普通人挺身而出，用自己的血肉之躯扛住黑暗的闸门，放我们到光明里去。
Many people liken Xu Peng to a hero, in fact, there has never been a superhero, are tens of millions of ordinary people with their own flesh and blood to carry the dark floodgates, let us go into the light.
口述 | 蔡　超整理 | 吴　雪2月21日凌晨4点30分，我永远不会忘记这一刻。
At 4: 30 a.m. on February 21, I will never forget this moment.
那天，天还没亮，也没有月亮，雨水噼里啪啦地打在车子的挡风玻璃上，我装卸完一批物资，到武汉仓库外的铁皮房中短暂休息，这个仓库是接受全球物资的捐赠，由蓝天救援和中华慈善总会负责。
That day, before it was light and there was no moon, the rain pattered on the windshield of the car. I loaded and unloaded a load of goods and took a short rest in a tin shed outside the Wuhan warehouse, which receives donations of global supplies and is managed by Blue Sky Rescue and the China Charity Federation.
我的身份正是蓝天救援队武汉应急仓库江苏地区领队蔡超。
My identity is blue sky rescue team Wuhan emergency warehouse Jiangsu regional leader Cai Chao.
半梦半醒中，我突然接到了队友倪荣凯的电话，电话那头传来一阵歇斯底里的哭声：“快救人，快救人，大本快不行了……”我一听，头脑瞬间就蒙了。
Half awake, I suddenly received a call from teammate Ni Rongkai, the other side of the phone calls a hysterical cry: "save people, save people, the big Ben almost dead..."
从倪荣凯的抽泣声中，我听出“大本”，也就是蓝天救援队机动队队长许鹏，在山东运送医疗物资时，出车祸了。
From the cries of Ni Rongkai, I recognized "Big Ben," that is, blue sky rescue team mobile team leader Xu Peng, in Shandong Province, when the medical supplies, accident.
蓝天救援队武汉应急仓库江苏地区领队蔡超（中间） 供图｜受访者武汉寂静的夜晚，电话那头的哭泣声极其刺耳。
blue sky rescue team Wuhan emergency warehouse Jiangsu regional leader Cai Chao (middle) for picture, yesteryear's quiet night in Wuhan, the cries over the phone were extremely shrill.
慌乱中，我稳住神儿，一边让倪荣凯赶紧打120救人，一边让他报告我出事的地点。
In a panic, I calm son, while let Ni Rongkai hurriedly call 120 rescue people, while let him report my accident place.
整个过程，我明显感觉到自己的嘴唇在颤抖。
Throughout the process, I clearly felt my lips quiver.
放下电话，我胡乱套了几件衣服，拿起外套冲出铁皮房，一路小跑到仓库领导小憩的车子上，到那里时，我喘了几大口气。
Putting down the phone, I scrambled out of the tin shack with my coat and trotted down the warehouse to the car where I was taking a few breaths when I arrived.
许鹏和我是老相识，2016年阜宁风灾时，我们第一次见面，当时他正在埋头搬运物资、分发物资，几个小时没停过。
Xu Peng and I are old acquaintances. We met for the first time in 2016, when he was busy carrying goods and distributing them for hours without stopping.
外形看着酷酷的硬汉形象，扎了一头的小脏辫，骨子里却寡言少语，为人特别低调。
Look at the cool shape of the tough man, a small dirty pony, but the bones of silence, a special low-key.
四年来，我们分别在老挝、缅甸、玉树雪灾等不同“救援战场”上碰过面，2月7日，他主动开车支援武汉，在应急仓库为各大医院分发物资，我们更结下了深厚的“革命友谊”。
Over the past four years, we have met in Laos, Myanmar, Yushu and other "rescue battlefields." On February 7, he volunteered to drive to Wuhan and distributed materials to major hospitals in emergency depot.
许鹏（左一）与蔡超（右一）在青海玉树救援我是第一个接到出事电话的人，他生死未卜，说什么我也不能丢下他不管。
Xu Peng (first from left) and Cai Chao (first from the right) in Qinghai Yushu Rescue I was the first person to receive an accident.
当时我的心里太乱了，做了一个非常不冷静的决定：“出城，去山东。
At that time, my mind was too confused, made a very calm decision: "out of the city, to Shandong.
”出事那天是武汉封城的第16天，想出城谈何容易。
The day of the accident was the sixteenth day of Wuhan, and it was not easy to get out of the city.
我们的车子有转运物资的特别通行证，可以上高速，但如果不报备下高速肯定违法，我顾不上那么多，理性失控了。
Our car has a special pass for trans-shipment and can get on the highway, but if I don't report high speed it must be against the law, I don't care so much, reason is out of control.
清晨5点半，我和一名队友跳上驾驶室，发动了车子，导航调到了出事地点山东省梁山县。
At 5: 30 in the morning, a teammate and I jumped into the cab, started the car, and the navigation was transferred to Liangshan County, Shandong Province.
一路上，我脑海中过电影一样闪回了许多之前和大本一起救援的画面，在高速公路疾驰中，我不敢接电话，怕听到坏消息。
Along the way, my mind flashed back to a lot of images of the rescue with Big Ben. I didn't dare answer the phone for fear of bad news.
我边开边哭，200公里的路开了2个小时，却像一个世纪那样漫长。
As I drove, I cried. The 200-kilometer drive lasted two hours, but it was as long as a century.
车子越开越快，但我的头脑开始逐渐恢复理智，我问我自己：如果下了高速，必须隔离14天，不仅帮不到任何忙，还添乱。
The car was moving faster and faster, but my mind began to come to my senses. I asked myself: If I was going at a high speed, I would have to be isolated for 14 days.
意义又何在？我决定立马调头回武汉。
What's the point? I decided to turn around and go back to Wuhan.
蓝天救援队每次执行任务都需要签署放行条　供图｜受访者许鹏在吃泡面　供图｜受访者我开始联系山东济宁的领队邱队长请求他的帮助，邱队长已经心照不宣地到达了出事地点。
/ [^ # 39 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 116] / n. Yesterday's blue sky rescue team was required to sign release slips for every visit by its owner, Xu Peng, for a picture.
5点20分，他带着大本上了救护车一起到达了医院，医院说不惜一切代价，救人……但最害怕的事情还是来了，许鹏39岁的年轻生命永远定格在了2020年春天的这个雨夜。
At 5: 20, he got into the ambulance with Big Ben, the hospital said to do whatever it takes to save people... but the most frightening thing came, Xu Peng 39-year-old young life forever fixed in the spring of 2020 on this rainy night.
我心底里撑着的那股劲也一下子崩了。
My innermost feelings of support that strength also suddenly collapsed.
从一同运送物资的队友倪荣凯的描述中，我得知了许鹏出事的全过程。
From the description of teammate Ni Rongkai, who transported the goods together, I learned of Xu Peng's accident.
许鹏参加救援活动有五六年经验，对长途开车早已习以为常，他平时身体素质非常好，知道当天晚上12点有运送100台消杀机的紧急任务，特意在下午睡了3个多小时。
Xu Peng, who has five or six years of experience in rescue operations, is used to long-distance driving. He is usually in good health and knows that he has an urgent duty to deliver 100 anti-aircraft at 12: 00 pm, and has slept for more than 3 hours in the afternoon.
21日凌晨4点30分许，许鹏一行驱车行驶至山东省济宁市梁山服务区一公里处，路中央突然出现了一辆停在高速中央的卡车，这辆卡车司机认为堵车的道路一时半会儿不会通畅，就把车灯关掉睡着了。
At about 4: 30 a.m. on the 21st, Xu Peng and his party drove one kilometer to Liangshan Service District, Jinning City, Shandong Province. Suddenly, a truck stopped in the middle of the highway. The truck driver thought the traffic would be blocked for a while and turned off the lights and went to sleep.
许鹏搬运物资　供图｜受访者没想到前面的卡车开走了，只有那辆卡车停在行车道上，而且没有开车灯提示。
+ + + + + + + + + + + the interviewee had not expected that the truck ahead had left, except for the lorry which was parked in the driveway and without any warning.
救援队一共三辆车，第一辆是小货车，一个急转弯幸运躲了过去。
The rescue team consisted of three vehicles, the first of which was a pick-up truck.
第二辆车是许鹏驾驶的皮卡，还没来得及转动方向盘，就瞬间失控，直接钻到卡车肚子里去了。
The second car is Xu Peng driving pickup truck, before turning the steering wheel, immediately out of control, directly into the belly of the truck to go.
队友倪荣凯开的是第三辆车，那天雨一直下个不停，出事前10秒钟，他刚刚用对讲机提示了前面两位队友：“前面有堵车，大家小心一点。
My teammate, Ni Rongkai, was driving his third car. It was raining hard that day. Ten seconds earlier, he had just given two of his teammates a warning on his walkie-talkie: "There's a traffic jam ahead.
”话音刚落，车就撞上了，停下车后，倪荣凯飞奔过去抢救，随后119救援人员、120救护车赶来救援......许鹏是救援队机动队队长，是机动队里的“定海神针”，但救援中，大家从来不过问对方身份以及对方家里的事情。
"No sooner had he said that than the car hit, stopped the car, Ni Rongkai rushed to rescue, 119 rescue workers, 120 ambulances rushed to rescue... Xu Peng is the rescue team captain, is the mobile team" Ding Haishen needles, "but in the rescue, people have never asked each other's identity and other family matters.
许鹏殉职后，我们花了很大功夫，才找到他盐城老家的亲人，许鹏的老婆、10岁的儿子和年迈的老母亲，当天下午五点陆续赶到。
After Xu Peng's death, it took us a long time to find the relatives in his hometown of Yancheng, Xu Peng's wife, 10-year-old son and elderly mother.
第二天凌晨，许鹏的遗体运回江苏苏州举行追悼会，然后再返回盐城老家安葬。
The next morning, Xu Peng's body returned to Suzhou, Jiangsu Province to hold a memorial service, and then returned to his hometown of Yancheng for burial.
许鹏的工作证件　供图｜受访者Play视频来源 |苏州广电总台蟹视频一路上，途经之处的高速口、服务区，几百名队友、交警，素不相识的群众，自发地一字排开，面向灵车庄重敬礼、送别.......而这样自发送别的场景，从山东寿光到江苏盐城的350公里的路途中，反复发生了十几次。
+ 20 + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + have + + + + + + + have happened dozens of times during the journey from Shouguang, Shandong Province, to Yancheng, Jiangsu Province, along the highway and service areas.
那天，我和我的队友，在武汉应急仓库，看着手机上报道的视频，哭了。
That day, my teammates and I, in Wuhan emergency warehouse, looked at the video report on the mobile phone, cried.
我心里特别难过，难过的是只能隔着屏幕向许鹏永远地道别。
My heart is particularly sad, sad is only across the screen to Xu Peng farewell forever.
虽然许鹏比我小2岁，但他更像一个大哥哥，干活踏实，吃得下苦，对家人报喜不报忧。
Although Xu Peng is 2 years younger than me, but he is more like a big brother, practical work, eat hard, happy family members do not worry.
这些天里，即便再紧张的救援，我脑子里仍不断闪现以前一起救援的场景。
These days, even the most intense rescue, I still flash in my mind before the rescue scene together.
记得去年元宵节，玉树雪灾，我俩前往救援，一下呆了20多天，当时玉树条件很艰苦，我们所在的村庄有5400多米的海拔，大家背着睡袋风餐露宿，昼夜奋战数天下来，精力几乎耗尽。
I remember last year's Lantern Festival, Yushu snowstorm, we went to the rescue, for more than 20 days, when the conditions are very difficult, our village has more than 5,400 meters above sea level, we are carrying sleeping bags, night and day fighting for days, energy almost exhausted.
玉树救援时所在的村庄有5400米海拔　供图｜受访者许鹏平日里多才多艺，吉他、唱歌、作曲作词，玩得很好。
The village where Yushu was rescued had 5,400 meters above sea level, but Xu Peng, the interviewee, had a very good time playing guitar, singing and composing lyrics.
他自己便和藏民沟通，默默写了一首原创歌曲，唱给大家听；还有一次救援队车子陷入了河道，高原体力活非常费劲，打钉铆、拎大锤的活儿都是许鹏第一个冲在前面；许鹏走了，但新冠肺炎病毒并非如人类一样是感情动物，它没有留出多余的时间让我们悲伤，我们只有将力量放在救援上。
He himself communicated with Tibetans, silently wrote an original song and sang it to everyone. Once, the rescue team got stuck in the river, and the hard work of riveting and carrying sledgehammer was the first to rush ahead. Xu Peng left.
目前，蓝天救援队的几十名队员，轮流接棒了许鹏未完成的工作。
At present, the blue sky rescue team dozens of members, took turns to pick up Xu Peng unfinished work.
Play许鹏为大家唱歌许鹏为灾民们搬运物资　供图｜受访者青海玉树地震救援时，车辆陷入河道，许鹏第一个冲在前面蓝天救援队全国有170多名队友，他们和许鹏一样，每天都有工作，一直没停下过脚步。
Play Xu Peng sang for all the people carrying supplies for the victims, Qinhai Yushu earthquake relief, the vehicle sank into a river, Xu Peng was the first team-mate in the country with more than 170 teammates, like Xu Peng, who worked every day without stopping.
我知道你给我发了许多条微信，我都没回。
I know you sent me a lot of letters, and I didn't return them.
因为很多忙碌的救援现场，根本来不及收发微信，断水断电也是常有的事。
Because many busy rescue sites, there is no time to send and receive micro-mail, water and electricity is often the case.
你联系我采访的那天晚上，我11点半到达铁皮房，接电话时我已经累得不想说话，只想倒头睡觉，所以采访推到了第二天，而在1个小时的采访里，我的对讲机也响了不止五六次。
The night you contacted me, I got to the tin room at 11: 30. I was too tired to talk when I answered the phone, and I just wanted to go to bed down, so the interview was pushed to the next day, and my walkie-talkie rang more than five or six times during the one-hour interview.
蔡超与队友正在核对物资　供图｜受访者如果你问我，在武汉救援这段时间，哪些日期，做了什么。
Cai Chao and her teammates are checking up on supplies, if you ask me, what dates and what you did during the rescue in Wuhan.
更多时候，我根本没有多余的脑力、精力去想。
More often than not, I don't have the extra mental energy to think about it.
我们的救援队员睡车上、吃泡面、连夜搬货，条件艰苦，但这些与医护人员比起来，根本算不上什么。
Our rescue team slept on the car, ate noodles, moved goods overnight in difficult conditions, but these are nothing compared to the medical staff.
一次，武汉一家医院的对接人来仓库提货，央求我们说：“能不能多给一些N95口罩，我们医院很缺。
Once, Wuhan hospital docking people to pick up goods, begged us to say: "Can you give some more N95 masks, our hospital is short.
”因为物资捐赠都是定向捐赠给指定医院，当时我们真想给他们，但作为执行人我们无权随意分配。
Because donations were directed to designated hospitals, we really wanted to give them, but as enforcers we had no right to distribute them at will.
事发前几天，许鹏在武汉天河机场调配物资　供图｜受访者说着说着，这个对接人突然哭了起来，她说医院确实需要N95口罩，一次性口罩对于一线医护风险太大了。
A few days before the incident, Xu Peng was distributing materials for use at Wuhan Tianhe airport, when the interviewee suddenly began to cry. She said the hospital really needed the N95 mask, which was too risky for first-line care.
我很难受，内心五味杂陈，我向她承诺，一定帮他们想办法协调一批N95口罩，如果协调不到，就向上级请示把队员们自己的N95口罩分给他们。
I felt miserable and had mixed feelings. I promised to help them find a way to coordinate a batch of N95 masks. If this was not possible, I asked my superiors to give them their own N95 masks.
而像这样的无奈，在武汉也许每天都有发生，疫情面前，大家都太难了，但大家都屏着那一股劲儿。
But such helplessness, in Wuhan may happen every day, in the face of the epidemic, we are too difficult, but we all screen that strong.
2月10日，许鹏最后一条朋友圈许鹏殉职第五天了，每天晚上睡不着的时候，我都会一屏屏翻看和他的聊天记录。
Xu Peng died on February 10th for the fifth day of his life. Every night when he was unable to sleep, I scanned the screen and his chat records.
2月10日他的最后一条朋友圈写道：“孩子要乖，爸爸去武汉打怪兽！”许鹏用一个美丽的谎言，向10岁的儿子解释自己为何不在家。
On February 10, one of his last friends wrote: "Children should be good, father goes to Wuhan to fight monsters!" Xu Peng used a beautiful lie to explain to his 10-year-old son why he was not at home.
许多人把许鹏比作英雄，其实，从来就没有超级英雄，都是千万个普通人挺身而出，用自己的血肉之躯扛住黑暗的闸门，放我们到光明里去。
Many people liken Xu Peng to a hero, in fact, there has never been a superhero, are tens of millions of ordinary people with their own flesh and blood to carry the dark floodgates, let us go into the light.
