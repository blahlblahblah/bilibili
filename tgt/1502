”新型冠状病毒的高传染性让所有国家严阵以待。
The high infectivity of the new coronavirus has set all countries on alert.
为了避免过多人前往医院造成交叉感染，缓解救护车的压力，英国伦敦提出了新冠病毒检测“上门服务”。
London has set up a "drop-in" service to detect the virus in order to avoid cross-infection caused by too many people going to hospitals and ease the pressure on ambulances.
据《英国医学期刊》2月14日报道，在上门检测的试点区域，疑似新冠肺炎病例会由当地全科医生诊所（GP）、国家医疗服务体系非紧急医疗求助电话平台（NHS111）和地方应急部门上报给检测中心。
Local GP clinics, NHS non-emergency medical help lines (NHS111) and local emergency departments report suspected cases of new crown pneumonia to testing centers in pilot areas where home-based tests are conducted.
随后检测中心会电话联系被检测人，确保他们健康状况良好，能够自行居家隔离，且家里环境能够使用防护服、护目镜等个人防护装备。
The test centre then calls the subject to ensure that they are in good health, that they are able to isolate themselves at home and that personal protective equipment such as protective clothing and goggles can be used in the home environment.
专业人员会在24小时内上门取检测样本，并对患者进行个人防护装备使用训练，给出自我隔离的建议，以及万一健康状况恶化的应对方法。
Specialists take samples from the home within 24 hours, train patients in the use of personal protective equipment, give advice on self-isolation, and respond in the event of a deterioration in health.
在结果出炉后，检测中心将第一时间通过电话告知被检测人，如果确诊，患者将被转诊至医院。
After the result comes out, the test center will inform the person by telephone first, if confirmed, the patient will be referred to the hospital.
上门检测的想法最早由英国伦敦诺斯威客公园医院传染病部门医生劳伦斯·约翰（Laurence John）提出。
The idea of door-to-door testing was first floated by Laurence John, a doctor at the Infectious Diseases Department at Norwich Park Hospital in London.
他对《英国医学期刊》透露，曾经有一个下午，伦敦有25辆救护车因为接送了疑似新冠肺炎病例被送去消毒，因此无法正常提供服务，带来极大不便。
One afternoon, he told the British Medical Journal, 25 ambulances in London were taken to disinfect suspected cases of Newcrown Pneumonia, causing major inconvenience.
一整套消毒流程会耗费一辆救护车8小时时间。
A complete sterilization process can take an ambulance eight hours.
从1月底，西北伦敦医疗保健信托（North West London NHS Trust）就开始实行上门检测服务，随后伦敦大学附属医院、圣乔治大学医院和盖伊和圣托马斯三个NHS基金会信托也宣布加入。
At the end of January, the North West London NHS Trust began implementing door-to-door testing, followed by the University of London Hospital, St. George's University Hospital, and the NHS Foundation Trusts in Guy and St. Thomas.
两周内已经有超过130名患者接受了检测。
More than 130 patients have been tested in two weeks.
医疗团队还希望呼吁社区和初级医护人员加入这一行动，包括训练实习护士进行检测，再由上级团队处理检测结果。
The team also wants to call on the community and primary health-care providers to join the effort, including training trainee nurses to conduct tests, which are then handled by a superior team.
伦敦大学附属医院传染病专家莎拉·罗根（Sarah Logan）表示，社区检测对于甄别具有传染性的呼吸道疾病是一种高效且易于接受的方法，不仅能敦促患者自我隔离，还能同时减少医院病床占有率，缓解救护车的压力。
Sarah Logan, an infectious diseases specialist at the University of London Hospital, says community testing is an efficient and acceptable way to identify infectious respiratory diseases, not only by urging patients to isolate themselves, but also by reducing hospital bed occupancy and reducing the pressure on ambulances.
来自诺斯威客公园医院的传染病专家阿什利·惠亭顿（Ashley Whittington）说，目前英国的首要任务是要训练社区团队，尽快扩大居家检测和隔离的安全模式，让内科医生们可以把更多精力集中在救治确诊患者，救护车也可以集中力量运输真正需要的重症病患。
Ashley Whittington, an infectious-diseases specialist from Northwaite Park Hospital, says Britain's top priority now is to train community teams to expand the safety model of home-based testing and seclusion as soon as possible, so that physicians can focus more on treating confirmed patients, and ambulances can concentrate on transporting seriously ill patients who really need them.
截至目前，英国总共发现9例新冠肺炎确诊病例，其中8例已经治愈。
So far, a total of nine confirmed cases of New Crown Pneumonia have been detected in the UK, eight of which have been cured.
还有超过2500人接受了新冠病毒检测。
More than 2,500 people have been tested for the new crown virus.
