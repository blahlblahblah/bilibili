鹅毛大雪。
It snowed heavily.
村子里循环播放了近20天的高音喇叭，罕见地息了声。
A high-pitched trumpet played in the village for nearly 20 days with an unusual sound.
这个春节，刘铭似乎补了一年的觉。
This Spring Festival, Liu Ming seems to make up for a year's sleep.
往常，他已开工半个多月。
As usual, he has been working for more than half a month.
账本上，他有200万元的欠款没要回来，他还有270万的民间借贷，每个月光利息差不多就24万。
On the books, he had two million yuan in arrears, 2.7 million yuan in private loans, and about 240,000 interest on each moon.
他歇的有点发毛。
He is a little hairy in the stream.
在这座被称为“丝网之乡”的河北小城安平，年近50的刘铭经营着一家拔丝厂。
In this so-called "Mesh Township" of Hebei Province Anping, the nearly 50-year-old Liu Ming runs a wire-drawing factory.
拔丝是丝网生产的第一步，即将钢条经多道工序拔成各种规格、粗细不同的丝，然后再根据不同用途织成各种各样的金属丝网。
Wire drawing is the first step in silk screen production, that is, the multi-pass process into various specifications, thickness of different silk, and then according to different uses woven into a variety of wire mesh.
这是一种听起来陌生，但又极为常见的工业产品，比如开采石油的振动筛、公路护栏、纱窗等。
This is a strange-sounding, but very common, industrial product, such as a vibrating screen for oil extraction, road barriers, screen windows, etc.
而有些深加工的丝网制品还会用于医药、化工甚至航空航天领域。
And some deep-processing screen products will also be used in medicine, chemical industry and even aerospace field.
不过就目前来看，低端、走量、粗加工仍占较大比重。
However, as far as the present, low-end, volume, rough processing still account for a larger proportion.
处在整个生产环节最前端，刘铭只是众多小老板之一，他有两个厂房，六台机器，六个工人。
At the front end of the production chain, Liu Ming is just one of many small bosses, he has two factories, six machines, six workers.
他每月拔1000吨丝的成本达350万元，而最终利润仅6万左右，这还不算工人工资、厂房设备等固定开销。
He plucked 1,000 tons of silk each month at a cost of 3.5 million yuan and ended up making only about 60,000, not counting the fixed costs of wages, plant and equipment.
尤其近两年，为办县里“旷日持久”的环评证等一系列手续，他上下打点还花了15万多。
In particular, in the past two years, he has spent more than 150,000 yuan to complete a series of procedures such as the "protracted" EIA certificate.
生产所形成的巨大资金压力，让他不得不十天催一次账。
The pressure of production was so great that he had to hurry his account for ten days.
在他上游，还有把丝加工为成品的织网厂，有镀锌喷塑等包装环节，再后边就是大大小小的经销商们，以及与之配套的物流、转运站和工业园区等。
Upstream, there was the web-weaving plant that turned silk into finished products, with zinc-plated sprays and other packaging links, followed by dealers of all sizes, and with it logistics, transfer stations and industrial parks.
这个人口仅33万的北方县城，丝网的产销量与出口量均能占到全国的80%以上。
With a population of only 330,000, the northern county accounts for more than 80 per cent of the nation's silk screen production and exports.
另据不完全统计，全县85%的民营企业皆与丝网有关，各类工厂达2万余家，国内外设有1.3万多家销售门店，总从业人数近22万。
According to incomplete statistics, 85 percent of private enterprises in the county are related to silk screen, with more than 20,000 factories and more than 13,000 sales outlets at home and abroad, with a total of nearly 220,000 employees.
现在，这个庞大的系统基本处于了停摆状态。
Now, the huge system is largely at a standstill.
“夫妻店”尽管全家一下子断了收入，但刘旺财瞅着仍居高不下的感染人数，寻思着晚点开门也好，“况且安平的物流都停着，营业也没用”。
Although the family suddenly lost their income, Liu looked at the number of people who were still infected and wondered whether it would be better to open the door late.
他补充说。
he added.
在江苏A市，刘旺财和妻子经营着一家丝网门市部，没有雇工，没有缴纳社保。
In A city of Jiangsu, Liu Wangcai and his wife run a screen door department, no employees, no social security contributions.
平日来，他们主要接些丝网订单，然后联系老家的人生产加工，由县里的物流车队统一运货。
On weekdays, they mainly take some silk screen orders, and then contact home production and processing, by the county's logistics fleet unified freight.
到了A市，如果市内短途，他们会给三轮车30块钱把货送到客户那儿，如果距离较远，货车要130元/次。
In A city, they give tricycles $30 to deliver goods to customers for short trips within the city, or $130 per truck for a longer distance.
除货物本身外，他们最大的成本就是房租了。
Besides the goods themselves, their biggest cost is the rent.
门市部在一个由外来生意人组成的五金市场，里面全是三层的商住两用门脸房——每层一间40平米的小屋，一层店面，二三层用来吃饭睡觉以及塞下部分货物。
The Market is a hardware market made up of foreign businessmen and is made up of three storeys of commercial and residential front rooms - a 40-square-metre hut on each floor, a storefront, two or three floors for eating and sleeping and stuffing away some goods.
“当初物业说的是商住两用，但上下楼梯全是简易木板，房间也没装修。
"Originally the property said commercial and residential use, but up and down stairs are all simple planks, the room was not decorated.
”刘旺财讲，因市场防火设施不达标，相关单位去年通知他们搬家，“这儿只能开店，不能住人”。
"Liu said that because the market did not meet fire protection standards, the relevant units last year informed them to move," here can only open shops, not live. "
一起生活十来年的“街坊四邻”曾表达不满，至今也没搬走。
The neighborhood, which had lived together for about a decade, had expressed its dissatisfaction and had not moved away.
算上在附近的两个仓库，他每年要支付12万的房租。
Including two warehouses nearby, he pays 120,000 a year in rent.
A市本身不大，可光五金市场里，就有来自家乡的30余家门店。
A city itself is not big, but light hardware market, there are more than 30 stores from home.
近些年，安平丝网的招牌挂满了全国各地，同行竞争，产品价格和利润一再压低。
In recent years, Anping screen signboards across the country, peer competition, product prices and profits have been repeatedly depressed.
“内销的话，有的客户要性价比，你质量上去了价也高了，结果客户跑了。
"If you sell at home, some customers want value for money, your quality is also high, resulting in the customer ran.
”折腾一年，刘旺财手里也剩不下几万块钱。
"Liu Wangcai had not tens of thousands of dollars left in his hand for a year.
他还称，有的公司采购员想吃点回扣，他没办法只好让生产厂“照意思办”。
He also said that some company buyers want to eat kickbacks, he has no choice but to let the factory "do as they wish."
和背景离乡的刘旺财不同，于江是安平当地的一家经销商。
Unlike Liu Wangcai from his hometown, Yu Jiang is a local dealer in Anping.
今年66岁的于江，和妻子已经退休在家，城里门店和生意转由小儿子接班，两个闺女成家后也做起了同样的买卖，互相帮衬着。
Yu Jiang, 66, and his wife have retired to their homes. The younger son has taken over the city's stores and businesses, and the two daughters have made the same sort of deal since they started a family.
前些年，于江在村里盖了个二层小楼，把闲置的平房和空地改建成了装货的仓库。
A few years ago, Yu Jiang built a second floor in the village and converted the idle bungalows and open spaces into warehouses for loading.
店面订单由儿子处理后，对接给各个村的作坊式加工厂，加工费定期一结。
The storefront order is handled by the son, docking to each village's cottage processing plant, processing fees periodically.
于江夫妇在家雇几个人，完成包装后即能发往全国各地。
Mr. and Mrs. Yu employ a few people at home, and when they finish packing, they can send it all over the country.
在安平，个体经营、家庭经济、作坊式生产仍是常见景象。
In Anping, self-employment, home economics, cottage production is still a common sight.
“这里已经形成具体生产某种产品的‘专业村’。
"There has been a 'specialty village' where specific products are produced.
”刘旺财称，不少生意还是走量，利润微博。
Liu said that a lot of business or the volume of profits Weibo.
尽管也有上千员工的“大公司”，但从老板层面也很难摆脱家族式管理。
Although there are thousands of "big companies" with thousands of employees, it's hard to get rid of family management at the boss level.
刘旺财暂时没回A市，五金市场里的店面都被贴上了封条。
Liu Wangcai did not return to A City, hardware market stores are affixed with seals.
他不清楚何时能复工，就算进屋睡觉，外来人口也得到当地社区和市场监管局登记备案。
He did not know when he would resume work, and even if he went to bed, the foreign population would be registered with the local Community and Market Regulatory Authority.
于江则安心在家抱孙子，尽管一家五口都断了饷。
Yu gave his grandson a hug at home, even though all five members of his family were unpaid.
当然，他们没有社保，没有退休金，也没有基本的抗风险能力。
Of course, they have no social security, no pensions, and no basic risk-averse capabilities.
传统对丝网所带来的一切，这里人早习以为常。
The tradition brings to the silk screen all, here people accustomed to often.
丝网生产已遍及全县8个乡镇、230个村庄。
Screen production has been spread throughout the county in eight townships, 230 villages.
安平地处华北平原中部，北京、天津、石家庄三角中心，是衡水建置最早的县，其历史曾与“罗”密不可分。
Anping is located in the middle of North China Plain, the triangle center of Beijing, Tianjin and Shijiazhuang, is the earliest county built in Hengshui.
据《深州风土记》记载，明神宗万历年间，安平绢罗远贩海外欧美地区，与五洲商旅交流，获利丰厚。
According to the book, the Ming Dynasty Sheng Zong Wanli, Anping Silk Road vendor overseas Europe and the United States, exchange with Wuzhou commercial tourism, rich profits.
罗在汉语中最初的意思是捕鸟的网，后来又被用于筛分东西。
Lo's original meaning in Chinese was to catch birds of the net, and was later used to screen things.
绢罗由蚕丝织成，造价高昂。
The silk spun silk is very expensive.
安平人开始采用马尾，一种更便宜的织罗材料。
The Anping people began to use horsetail, a cheaper weaving material.
1918年，医生徐老山突发奇想，如果用更细的金属丝，马尾罗是否能让药品的筛分更加精细，为此，他引进日本的金属丝并织成了网，然后办起了安平县第一家金属丝网厂。
In 1918, the doctor Xu Laoshan wondered if, with a finer wire, Ma Mei-luo would be able to sift through the medicine more finely. He imported Japanese wire and woven it into a net, then set up Anping County's first wire mesh factory.
马尾罗与手工织机（央视纪录片《走遍中国》视频截图）几十年时间，马尾罗这项只能纯手工的传统编织技艺，逐渐消退。
Mawei Lou and handloom (CCTV documentary "Walk through China" video capture) For decades, Ma Tailor, a purely manual traditional knitting technique, has faded away.
1980年代，包括安平县拔丝厂、地方国营织网厂在内的四家县办企业，奠定了整体产业基础。
In the 1980s, four county-run enterprises, including the Anping County Silk Factory and the local State-owned Weaving Factory, laid the overall industrial foundation.
刘旺财16岁时就进了这行。
Liu Wangcai entered the business at the age of 16.
他当时到北京前门给人家盯铺面，每月挣150块钱。
He went to the front door of Beijing to be stared at, earning $150 a month.
他回忆称，此前1983年，安平在北京珠市口已经开了第一家门店。
He recalled that Anping had opened its first store in Beijing in 1983.
最终，他辗转多地后还是回到了老家“丝网街”。
Eventually, after tossing and turning, he returned to his hometown of "silk street."
丝网街，县里最早专事丝网买卖的区域。
Screen Street, the county's earliest area specializing in silk screen business.
1997年，位于县城西边、占地600余亩的丝网大世界建成，这是原国家计委批准立项的全国唯一的丝网批发市场。
In 1997, the 600-acre screen world, located on the western side of the county seat, was the only wholesale screen market in the country approved by the State Planning Commission.
为让扎堆东边丝网街的企业入驻，县政府给了两项政策优惠，一是企业所得税两年内返还一半，二是两年内减免工商管理费。
In order to set up enterprises in the East Side Mesh Street, the county gave two policy advantages, one is to return half of the enterprise income tax within two years, and the other is to reduce business management fees within two years.
不过多位亲历者透露，促成企业搬迁的直接因素，是“实行了交通管制，货车不允许进入主城区”。
However, a number of people close to the company revealed that the relocation of the direct factor is "traffic control, goods vehicles are not allowed into the main city."
（图为央视纪录片《走遍中国》视频截图）很快，这里成了中国最大的丝网产品交易中心。
(Photo shot on CCTV documentary "Go Through China" video screenshot) Soon, here has become China's largest screen products trading center.
1999年，中国五金制品协会授予安平“丝网之乡”称号。
In 1999, the China Hardware Association awarded Anping the title of "silk screen town."
从建筑格局上看，丝网大世界同样是商住两用房，当初的房租约是1.5万元/年，拿10万能买下一套门脸房。
From the architectural pattern, screen is the same large world is dual-use commercial housing, the original rent of about 15 million yuan / year, take 10 universal purchase of a front room.
“现在的租金也就几千块钱。
"" Right now the rent is in the thousands.
”于江眼瞅着到店的客流越来越少，同行搬家的越来越多。
"Yu watched as the flow of passengers to the store dwindled and more and more fellow travelers moved.
20年下来，丝网大世界也冷清了。
Twenty years down, the screen world is also cold.
上网荣顺把冷清的原因，归于电子商务和新工业园与物流基地的崛起。
Rongshun online reasons for the cold, due to e-commerce and the rise of a new industrial park and logistics base.
“人们可以在网上询价了，不用再大老远跑你店里来。
"People can make inquiries online and don't have to go all the way to your store.
”荣顺觉得，只要线上交易一两次，产品质量没问题，客户跟商家就会建立长期关系，丝网大世界的用途削弱了，而像他这样的外地经销商更受到不小的冲击。
Rong Shun thinks that as long as online trading once or twice, product quality is not a problem, customers and businesses will establish long-term relationships, the use of the screen world weakened, and foreign dealers like him are not small impact.
在江苏B市，荣顺也开着一家丝网门店。
In Jiangsu B city, Rong Shun also open a screen door shop.
前两年，他儿子花两万元找人做了个网站，“也就赚回点本钱”。
Two years ago, his son paid 20,000 yuan for a website, "so he can earn some money back."
而早在2000年初，刘铭和刘旺财就凑钱在网上弄过一个站点，“最后全赔了”，直到现在，他们对互联网始终表现得极为小心谨慎。
Back in early 2000, Liu Ming and Liu Wangcai pooled their money to get a site online and "lost it all," and have been extremely cautious about the Internet ever since.
由于丝网这种工业品属性，电商平台上显示的交易量也并不多。
Due to the industrial properties of screen, the electronic commerce platform displayed on the transaction volume is not much.
“有挣了大钱的。
"" Some who make a lot of money.
”荣顺讲，“网上主要是样品信息展示和询价渠道，产品多定做，价格不好透明”。
"Rong Shun said," The main online sample information display and inquiry channels, more customized products, the price is not transparent. "
在日本，荣顺有几个固定客户。
In Japan, Rong Shun has several regular customers.
1997年前后，一个客户每年就能要30万元的烧烤网。
Around 1997, a customer could ask for $300,000 a year in barbecue.
他后来添了机器和工人。
He later added machines and workers.
再后来，随着雇工成本越来越高，他干脆让工人回家单干，给他供货，原来的雇佣关系成了上下游的合作关系。
Later, as the cost of employing workers grew, he simply sent them home to work alone, supplying him, and the former employment relationship became an upstream-downstream partnership.
这些年，荣顺都是做半成品，然后有家固定合作商进行外表喷涂包装，“老家镀锌便宜，但质量并没外边好”。
Over the years, Rong Shun is semi-finished products, and then have a regular partner for the appearance of spray packaging, "home galvanized cheap, but the quality is not outside good."
据他推算，投资一套深加工的厂房设备少说也得三百万。
He reckons that investing in a deep-processing plant would cost as little as three million dollars.
“安平不是不能做好的，但你得出到那么多钱才行。
s not impossible for Ping to do well, but you have got to get so much money.
”荣顺说。
'he said.
自2001年，安平开始举行每年一届的国际丝网博览会，邀全球客商到中国参展。
Since 2001, Anping has held an annual International Screen Fair, inviting the world's merchants to China to participate in the exhibition.
但据衡水市商务部数据，2018全年，衡水出口总额196.9亿元，其中丝网业15.11亿元，总占比下降3.29%，丝网出口额同比2017年下降了3.14%。
However, according to Hengshui Ministry of Commerce, in 2018, Hengshui exports totaled 19.69 billion yuan, of which 1.511 billion yuan was accounted for by silk screen, a decrease of 3.29 percent.
一直以来，安平都缺少足够体量的丝网龙头企业。
All the time, Anping is lack of adequate amount of screen leading enterprises.
外贸，既是引擎又是挑战。
Foreign trade is both an engine and a challenge.
荣顺的出口业务虽也有所萎缩，生意整体倒没受太大影响。
Rongshun's export business has shrunk somewhat, but business as a whole has not been much affected.
他的门店在当地一家建材市场，他自称得益于中国房地产高速发展，“建筑用网翻倍增长”。
His shop is in a local construction materials market and he claims to have benefited from China's rapid real estate growth, "doubling the number of construction nets."
2010年后，安平在城东陆续建设丝网工业园和聚成国际物流园区。
After 2010, Anping in the east of the construction screen industrial park and gathered into an international logistics park.
而位于城西的丝网大世界距此有10公里，不少商家选择搬到了物流园附近。
Located in the west of the screen world is 10 kilometers away, many businesses choose to move to the nearby logistics park.
“当时买就是打算出租，房还没盖好，物流就已经搬过去了。
"When I bought it, I wanted to rent it. Before I had finished, the logistics had already moved in.
”这些年，荣顺在地和房上投了不少钱，他准备下手工业园时，地价已经涨到15万/亩，而且要求一次性买一块地（100亩），他钱不够，只好从朋友的100亩里盘下了10亩。
Over the years, Rong Shun invested a lot of money on the floor and in his house. As he prepared to start the industrial park, the price of land had risen to 150,000 mu, and he wanted to buy a piece of land (100 mu) at a time.
正月二十三。
Twenty-third January.
天晴正好。
It was fine.
荣顺的儿子赶回了江苏，到店后一个人吃了碗泡面。
Rong Shun's son rushed back to Jiangsu, to the store after a person ate a bowl of noodles.
