据了解，向隔离病房派驻精神科医生，上海是行动最早的城市。

在高风险、高压力的工作环境中，医护人员也容易成为精神上的“患者”。

Another task of Dr Chan Chun in the isolation ward is to safeguard the mental health of medical staff.
“我们会帮助大家接纳和直面自己的情绪，一起打赢这场战役。
"We will help you to accept and face your emotions and win this battle together.
”他介绍，公卫临床中心已经腾挪出一个空间，作为“心灵解压室”，医护人员可以到这个独立的空间咨询。
He said the public health clinic had vacated a space to act as a "mental decompression chamber" where paramedics could go for independent space consultations.
“我一来就把自己的微信二维码打印出来，贴在食堂墙上，医护人员可以加我微信，保证他们得到专业的心理指导。
"I printed out my microphone code in two dimensions and stuck it on the wall of the cafeteria, where paramedics would send me letters to ensure that they received professional psychological guidance.
这是一种人性化服务。
This is a humanized service.
”目前公卫临床中心隔离病房医护人员采取轮班制，医生护士每一组工作时间为一周或者两周，工作时间结束，他们会被安排到公卫临床中心一幢专用于隔离观察的宿舍楼里，进行两周的隔离观察和休息。

“在高压力、高强度下，医护人员也可能出现应激反应，精神科医生在这里是一种保障。

每次床边精神检查至少15分钟穿着隔离服做“精神体验”，对陈俊医生来说也是第一次。
At least 15 minutes of each bedside psychiatric examination will be a "mental experience" in an isolation garment for the first time for Dr. Chen.
“对于患者来说可能是医生跟他攀谈，但实际上我们是用专业的技术对他进行精神检查。
"It may be the doctor who talks to him, but we actually examine him professionally," he said.
攀谈的过程中，我要了解患者是否存在精神症状，有没有躯体反应，最后得出一个精神诊断结论。
During the conversation, I want to know whether the patient has mental symptoms, there is no somatic reaction, and finally come to a mental diagnosis.
”他说，如果是在上海市精神卫生中心诊室，这样的精神检查过程一般需要20分钟以上。
In the Shanghai Mental Health Center, such a psychiatric examination typically takes more than 20 minutes, he said.
但在新冠肺炎隔离病房，考虑患者身体状况和特殊的环境，这个过程尽量压缩，但也不会少于15分钟。
But in the New Crown Pneumonia Isolation Ward, considering the patient's physical condition and special circumstances, this process should be kept as short as possible, but not less than 15 minutes.
在这15分钟里，陈俊医生与患者近距离接触。
During the 15 minutes, Dr Chan was in close contact with the patient.
两周时间，陈俊医生和其他隔离病房的医护人员一样，住在一楼宿舍，上一层楼就是上班。
For two weeks, Dr. Chan, like other isolation ward staff, lived in the ground floor dormitory and went to work on the first floor.
2周工作结束后，他也要到隔离观察宿舍再独处2周，才能回家。
