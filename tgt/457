新冠疫情发生前，疾控系统已面临危机。
Before the outbreak of the New Crown, the disease control system was in crisis.

地球被毁灭之前究竟发生了什么？。
What happened before the earth was destroyed?
作者 | 韩方航编辑 | 朱凯麟新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情发生以来，本应承担疾病预防控制、突发公共卫生事件应急的疾控中心，因为一篇看似“早已知情”的论文被推上风口浪尖【1】。
Ren Chu, the new coronavirus pneumonia, should have been the CDC for disease prevention and control and public health emergency response since a seemingly "long-known" paper was put on the scene.
这篇由多位疾控人士署名的论文指出，自 2019 年 12 月中旬起，新型冠状病毒就已经出现了人传人现象。
Since mid-December 2019, the new coronavirus has been a human-to-human phenomenon, according to a paper signed by several disease controllers.
而在此前，多位中国卫生系统的专家都在疫情早期阶段否认出现人传人现象。
Earlier, experts from China's health system denied any human-to-human transmission in the early stages of the epidemic.
1 月 31 日下午，中国疾控中心主任高福和副主任冯子健分别做出了模糊的回应，似乎在暗示他们只是“向公众预警疫情”这个复杂流程中的一环。
On the afternoon of January 31, Gao Fu, director of the China CDC, and Feng Zijian, deputy director of CDC, gave vague responses that seemed to imply that they were only part of a complex process of "alerting the public to the epidemic."
而我们想要搞清楚的是，疾控中心到底是一个怎样的部门，能够发挥怎样的作用？我们在梳理了近年来关于中国疾控系统的报道之后发现，疾控系统内部对于疾控系统自身的衰落似乎早有警惕。
What we want to know is what kind of department CDC is and what role it can play? After combing recent reports on China's disease-control system, we find that there seems to be early warning within the disease-control system about the decline of the disease control system itself.
大量的人员流失和财政不足，致使疾控中心在应对突然传染病大爆发时可能无力发挥它应有的控制疾病传播的作用。
The massive loss of personnel and inadequate finances have left the CDC vulnerable to sudden outbreaks of infectious disease.
“面对‘健康中国 2030’的宏伟目标，应该是公共卫生和疾控系统大发展的良机，中国疾控人甩开膀子大干的时候，但是却因为长期积累的各种问题，以及受近期因政策性原因导致收入进一步下降的影响，疾控系统人心浮动、人才加速外流。
"The ambitious goal of Healthy China 2030 should be a great opportunity for public health and disease control," he said. "When China's disease controllers throw their arms around, they are suffering from chronic problems and a further drop in income for policy reasons in the recent past.
”2019 年 6 月，在在国务院发展研究中心召开了中国医改十年研讨会上，中国疾控中心研究院曾光就曾经这样说【2】。
In June 2019, Zeng Guang, of the China CDC Institute, said at a 10-year seminar on China's healthcare reform at the Development Research Center of the State Council.
曾光的表态意在呼吁，中国医疗改革中应该进一步关注疾控中心的作用，并能够发挥它应有的作用。
Mr. Zeng's comments were intended to call for greater focus on the role of the CDC in China's health-care reform and for it to play its rightful role.
而要真正能够让疾控体系发挥应有的作用，也依赖于对于过去存在于中国疾控系统中许多制度性问题的纠正。
And to make the disease control system play its due role depends on the correction of many systemic problems that existed in China's disease control system in the past.
大量人才流失是中国疾控系统所面临的最明显问题。
Mass brain drain is the most obvious problem facing China's disease control system.
而这种人才流失出现在从中央到地方的各个层面上。
This brain drain occurs at all levels, from the central to the local.
2019 年两会期间，贵州省疾病预防控制中心卫生健康促进与宣传教育所副所长何琳以中央级别的中国疾控中心为例指出，中国疾控中心 2015 到 2017 年 3 年间走了 165 人，其中 2 人是百千万人才国家级人选、突出贡献专家、政府特贴专家的顶尖专家。
During the 2019 session, He Lin, deputy director of the Center for Health Promotion and Publicity at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Guizhou Province, cited the China CDC at the central level as an example.
2018 年又走了 49 人，“直接影响国家级疾控中心核心竞争力，影响疾控事业未来发展。
In 2018, another 49 people walked, "directly affect the core competitiveness of the national CDC, affecting the future development of disease control."
”【3】作为一线城市的上海也并不乐观。
Shanghai, a leading city, is not so sanguine either.
上海市公共卫生临床中心始建于非典之后的 2004 年，参照北京的小汤山模式，作为传染病集中收治隔离点而存在。
The Shanghai Public Health Clinic Center was set up in 2004 after SARS. It is based on the Xiaotangshan model in Beijing and exists as a centralized quarantine point for infectious diseases.
此次的新型冠状病毒疫情当中也是如此。
The same is true of the new coronavirus outbreak.
【4】然而，这家医院也面临着严重的人才流失现象。
However, the hospital is also facing a serious brain drain.
澎湃新闻在 2017 年 1 月对上海市政协常委朱同玉的采访中指出，“近 5 年来（注：约为 2012 年到 2017 年），上海市公共卫生临床中心一线人员流失率居高不下，离职医务人员已达 205 人，占全院职工的 23.3%。
In an interview with Zhu Tongyu, a permanent member of the Shanghai Municipal Association in January 2017, "the turnover rate of front-line staff at Shanghai Municipal Public Health Clinics has remained high over the past five years, with 205 medical staff leaving the hospital, accounting for 23.3 percent of the hospital's staff.
流失人员中有 23% 是医师……目前各条线均有骨干提出离职申请，尤其是临床骨干的离职对公卫中心造成不可估量的损失，严重削弱了公卫中心对传染病疫情的应急救治能力，一旦突发疫情，将无法有力承担起基本的救治任务。
At present, 23% of the lost staff are doctors... At present, all lines of separation of the backbone of the application, especially the departure of the public health center caused incalculable losses, seriously weakened the public health center for infectious disease epidemic emergency response capacity, once the outbreak of the outbreak, will not be able to effectively assume the basic treatment task.
”【5】此外，中国卫健委下属机关报《健康报》曾在 2019 年 3 月两会期间采访多个地方卫健委党组书记和主任，包括吉林、内蒙古、广西等多个地方的官员都认为，“疾控机构人才断层现象明显，公共卫生医师短缺，特殊地方病防控人才更加短缺。
Moreover, officials from Jilin, Inner Mongolia and Guangxi, among others, interviewed the secretaries and directors of several local health committees during the March 2019 two-year conference, and officials from Jilin, Inner Mongolia and Guangxi agreed that "there is a significant talent shortage in the CDC, a shortage of public health doctors and a shortage of special endemic disease control personnel."
”其中，吉林省还有疾控员工高龄化的趋势，“市、县级疾控机构此类现象尤为严重，人员年龄结构均以 45 岁～ 54 岁组为主，且占比逐年增高”。
Among them, Jilin Province also has a trend of the senior management of disease staff, particularly in city and county-level disease control institutions, where the age structure of personnel is dominated by people aged 45 to 54, and the proportion is increasing year by year.
【6】目前中国疾控系统的人员缺口十分明显。
The current staffing gap in China's disease-control system is clear.
民主党派中国农工民主党上海市委在 2019 年的上海市两会期间提交了一份提案，要求加强上海公共卫生专业人才队伍建设。
The democratic party, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, submitted a proposal during the 2019 session of the Shanghai NPC and CPC to strengthen Shanghai's professional team of public health professionals.
其中的一组数据值得警惕。
One set of data is alarming.
“疾控中心人员的编制配备根据中央编办的要求，原则上按照上海市常住人口万分之 1.75 的比例核定。
"The establishment of the CDC personnel shall, in principle, be approved in accordance with the requirements of the central planning office at 1.75 parts per 10,000 resident population of Shanghai.
2017 年底上海市常住人口是 2418.33 万，理论上疾控中心人员按要求总量需配备 4232 人。
The resident population of Shanghai at the end of 2017 will be 24,183,300, with 4,232 people theoretically required to staff the CDC.
实际上根据上海市疾控中心 2017 年的统计数据，全市疾控机构人员总数是 2904 人，编制配备仍有 1328 人的缺口。
In fact, according to the 2017 statistics of the Shanghai CDC, the total number of CDC personnel in the city is 2,904, with a shortfall of 1,328 personnel.
”【7】若按照上述比例，14 亿中国人口大约需要 24.5 万疾控人员，而前述何琳的报道中则称中国仅有大约 20 万疾控人员，缺口接近 20% 。
At the same rate, China's 1.4 billion people would need 245,000 disease controllers, compared with about 200,000 in China, a shortfall of nearly 20%, according to Hollene's report.
疾控系统人才大量流失，其原因大抵和其他行业一样，无法给予足够的工作成就感，以及无法获得足够的经济回报，而两者都与体制的变化有关。
The massive brain drain in disease-control systems is largely due to a lack of job satisfaction, as in other industries, and insufficient financial returns, both of which are associated with institutional change.
从经济层面来看，我们查阅多个地方疾控中心的部门决算报表发现，疾控系统能够获得的财政支持并不稳定。
At the economic level, a review of the departmental accounts of various local CDC's found that the financial support available to the disease control system was not stable.
近年来，部分地区的疾控中心预算有所上升，但也有为数不少的疾控中心预算出现明显下滑。
In recent years, some areas of the CDC budget has increased, but a significant number of CDC budget has decreased significantly.
云南省疾控中心在 2017 年度收入合计达到 5.14 亿元，而到了 2018 年度就只剩下了 4.48 亿元。
The CDC in Yunnan Province will have a combined revenue of 514 million yuan in 2017, leaving only 448 million yuan in 2018.
其中，来自于财政的拨款从 3.51 亿元下滑到 3.39 亿元。
Of that amount, funding from the financial sector dropped from 351 million yuan to 339 million yuan.
【8】天津疾控中心 2018 年的年度收入为 2.28 亿元，比 2017 年少了 1.48 亿元。
Tianjin CDC annual revenue in 2018 will be 228 million yuan, 148 million yuan less than in 2017.
【9】据我们的不完全统计，同样的情况还出现在四川省阿坝州、山东省菏泽市、湖南长沙市天心区等多个地区。
According to our incomplete statistics, the same situation has occurred in Aba Prefecture in Sichuan Province, Heze City in Shandong Province and Tianxin District in Hunan Province.
自 2003 年非典以来，疾控系统所获得的财政拨款在绝对数量上有所上升，但却并没有跟上整体经济发展水平。
Financial allocations to the disease control system have increased in absolute terms since 2003, but have not kept pace with the overall level of economic development.
《光明日报》的一篇报道指出，“疾控中心政府投入占同级财政支出的比例呈现下降趋势，从 2002 年的 1.27‰ 下降到 2012 年的 1.05‰，下降了 17.3%，政府投入的增长滞后于社会经济的增长速度。
"The proportion of government spending at the same level in the CDC has shown a downward trend, dropping by 17.3 percent from 1.27 per thousand in 2002 to 1.05 per thousand in 2012, and the growth of government input has lagged behind that of social and economic growth," said a report in Guangming Daily.
”【10】此外，《光明日报》也指出，疾控系统所获得的资金更多用于防治专项类的特定项目，而对于维持公共职能极为重要的经常性维持经费仍不足。
In addition, the Guangming Daily pointed out that funds for the disease control system are used more for specific projects in the specific category of prevention and treatment, while regular maintenance funds, which are essential for maintaining public functions, remain insufficient.
“2002 - 2012 年人均人员经费增长 290.6%，人均公用经费增长为 190.8% ……均低于同期全国财政支出（471.1%）和社会经济（人均 GDP）的增长速度（308.8%）”这些都导致了疾控体系中的员工没有足够的经济激励。
"The increase in per capita personnel costs of 290.6 per cent in 2002-2012 and the increase in per capita public expenditure of 190.8 per cent... are lower than the national fiscal expenditure (471.1 per cent) and socio-economic (308.8 per cent) growth rates for the same period."
有些地方甚至无法完成日常的传染病防疫功能。
Some places can not even complete the routine epidemic prevention function.
除了财政投入并不充足以外，近年来疾控中心改革措施也进一步缩紧了疾控中心的财力。
In addition to inadequate financial input, CDC reform measures in recent years have further tightened the CDC's financial resources.
在中国现行体制内，疾控中心属于公益事业单位。
In China's current system, the CDC is a public welfare institution.
但在此前，疾控中心的部分收入来自于为公众提供的付费，例如体检以及疫苗接种等。
But until now, the CDC had derived part of its revenue from payments to the public, such as medical examinations and vaccinations.
2017 年，国务院下令取消了一部分行政事业收费。
In 2017, the State Council ordered the abolition of some administrative fees.
疾控中心也受此影响，一些收费项目被取消。
The CDC was also affected and some fee items were cancelled.
而民众自费的二类疫苗接种也被要求不得在疫苗价格基础上加价提供服务。
And people who pay their own way are required not to offer services at a premium to the price of vaccines.
这些都对疾控中心的收入造成了影响。
All this has had an impact on CDC revenues.
江西省九江市下辖永修县疾控中心就在 2018 年部门决算中指出，“2018 年永修县疾病预防控制中心部门收入预算总额为 854.7 万元，较上年预算安排减少 221.55 万元，原因是取消各项收费项目及疫苗零差价。
The 2018 departmental final accounts of Yongxiu County, under the jurisdiction of the Yongxiu County CDC in Jiujiang City, Jiangxi Province, said in the 2018 departmental final accounts. "The 2018 annual revenue budget for the Yongxiu County Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is 8.547 million yuan, a decrease of $22.155 million from the previous year's budget.
”【11】曾光认为，尽管疾控中心应该取消过多行政收费，以履行疾控中心的公益职能，但若是这一部分收入没有财政即时弥补，也会挫伤疾控系统员工的工作积极性，也会造成人员的进一步流失。
Zeng argues that while the CDC should eliminate excessive administrative fees to carry out CDC's pro bono functions, the lack of immediate financial compensation for that part of the revenue could discourage staff from the disease-control system and cause further staff attrition.
这种担忧也绝非多虑。
This concern is by no means excessive.
《第一财经》此前调查二类疫苗灰色产业链时就援引曾就职于 WHO 免疫规划中心的专家，“河北某县级防疫站，50 多个人，只有 12 个人是有编制的，其他的人工资都是需要通过市场上去找，如果切断疫苗的利益，他们会寻找别的方式来挣钱。
"Only 12 out of more than 50 people in a county-level epidemic prevention station in Hebei province have their own staff. The rest of the people are paid through the market, and if the vaccine is cut off, they will look for other ways to make money
但是没有这些临时工，预防的工作只靠编制内人员，是干不了的。
Without these temporary workers, however, prevention efforts cannot be carried out on the basis of staffing alone.
”【12】同一报道中，也有一位地方疾控工作人员表示，“如果不靠业务创收，我们无法给没有编制的人发工资。
In the same report, a local CDC official said: "If we don't make money from business, we can't pay unstaffed people.
”江苏省疾控中心在 2018 年 8 月的《中国卫生政策研究》中发表文章。
The Jiangsu CDC published an article in the August 2018 China Health Policy Study.
调查了 102 家疾控中心之后，他们认为，“取消行政事业性收费政策实施后……仅 16% 的机构有政府补偿,部分机构出现人员收入下降、人员流出部门或单位、仪器更新和维护受到影响。
After a survey of 102 CDC's, they found that "only 16 percent of the agencies after the abolition of administrative fees were compensated by the government, some experienced a decrease in personnel income, outflow of personnel from departments or units, and equipment renewal and maintenance were affected."
”【13】在人员大量流失、财政拨款不足的情况下，有迹象表明疾控系统被重视的程度进一步降低。
"2007-9-24 15: 23 [hide] There are signs that the attention paid to the disease-control system has been further reduced in the face of massive staff losses and inadequate financial allocations.
2018 年，山西和辽宁两个省都启动了新一轮的机构改革，而县市级别的疾控中心甚至都失去了作为一个独立机构存在的地位。
In 2018, both Shanxi and Liaoning provinces launched a new round of institutional reforms, and county and municipal CDC centres have lost even their status as an independent agency.
2018 年 7 月 4 日，沈阳市发布《沈阳市市直公益性执业单位优化整合方案》，沈阳市疾控中心被合并入市卫生健康服务与行政执法中心，为市卫生计生委所属事业单位，不定机构规格。
On July 4, 2018, Shenyang City issued the "Shenyang City Direct Public Health Practitioners Optimization Integration Program," Shenyang CDC was merged into the City Health Services and Administrative Enforcement Center, an institution under the Municipal Health and Family Health Commission, with uncertain institutional specifications.
同属于该中心的机构还有，中心血站、献血办公室、医学服务中心、健康教育中心等机构。
Other institutions that belong to the Centre are the Central Blood Centre, the Blood Donation Office, the Medical Service Centre, the Health Education Centre, etc.
此前一周，抚顺也发布了类似的机构调整方案。
A week earlier, Fushun had announced a similar structural adjustment program.
抚顺市疾控并入市大健康产业研究院，为市直属事业单位，机构规格县级。
Fushun City disease control and into the Health Industry Research Institute, directly under the city, agency specifications at the county level.
同属于该产业研究院的机构还有，中小学卫生保健所、中心血站、急救指挥中心、医学会等机构。
The Institute also includes primary and secondary health-care centres, central blood stations, emergency command centres and medical societies.
【14】而在山西，山西省卫生计生委副主任、省医改办主任冯立忠表示，要在 2018 年 8 月底前，24 个示范县将把疾控中心融入医疗集团。
In Shanxi province, Feng Lizhong, deputy director of Shanxi Provincial Health and Family Health Commission and director of provincial health reform, said the 24 model counties would integrate the CDC into the Medical Group by the end of August 2018.
【15】这一情况被解读为进一步弱化疾控中心功能。
The situation has been interpreted as a further weakening of the CDC.
美国加州大学洛杉矶分校UCLA公共卫生学院副院长、流行病学资深终身教授张作风接受《知识分子》采访表示：“政府和管理部门对预防医学公共卫生的不重视，忽视疾控中心公共卫生队伍的建设，以至造成待遇差，最佳人才的流失，甚至还有部分地方计划或已取消疾控中心或者把疾控中心与医院合并。
Zhang style, vice-dean and permanent professor of epidemiology at UCLA's UCLA School of Public Health, told Intellectuals: "The government and management pay little attention to preventive medicine and neglect to build a CDC public health team, resulting in poor pay and loss of the best talent.
”【16】事实上，从过去几年来看，疾控系统被削弱，无法发挥其应有的传染病防治作用已经早有迹象。
Indeed, over the past few years, the disease-control system has been weakened from its rightful role in preventing and treating infectious diseases.
如 2009 年甲型 H1N1 流感疫情，在 2009 年 5 月 11 日至 2010 年 8 月 10 日间，中国内地共确诊 128033 例，死亡 805 例，致死率 0.6%。
For example, during the period from 11 May 2009 to 10 August 2010, 128,033 cases and 805 deaths, representing a mortality rate of 0.6 per cent, were diagnosed in the Mainland of China.
【17】手足口病自 2007 年以来重新成为中国公共卫生的一大威胁。
HFMD has re-emerged as a major public health threat in China since 2007.
《中华流行病学杂志》于 2019 年刊登的论文指出，2008 年到 2017 年全国手足口病报告发病率为 134.59/10 万，平均增长 15.92%，报告重症比例为 0.84%，平均增长 9.56%。
According to a paper published in 2019 in the Chinese Journal of Epidemiology, the reported incidence of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease was 134.59 per 100,000 live births between 2008 and 2017, an average increase of 15.92 per cent, and 0.84 per cent of reported cases, an average increase of 9.56 per cent.
【18】从这些案例来看，中国疾控系统在传染病防治上似乎并没有完成他们被赋予的责任。
[18] Judging from these cases, China's disease-control system does not seem to be fulfilling the responsibilities assigned to it in the fight against infectious diseases.
前文所列的种种数据指出了众多疾控系统所面临的外部压力。
The data presented above point to the external pressures faced by many disease control systems.
由于传染病防治长期得不到重视，致使疾控系统资金缺乏，人才流失。
Due to the chronic neglect of infectious disease control, disease control system is short of funds and brain drain.
而当新型冠状病毒袭来的时候，这样的一个疾控体系也正如人们所看到的那样节节败退。
And when the new coronavirus hit, such a disease control system as people have seen a gradual retreat.
对于疾控系统的整体性检讨仍然是有必要的，包括其内部的运行机制，以及其与整个官僚体制之间的关系。
A holistic review of the disease control system is still necessary, including its internal operating mechanisms and its relationship with the overall bureaucracy.
而本文试图指出的是，如果一个国家必须要有一个机构承担疾病预防控制的职能，而这个职责目前需要由疾控中心承担的话，那么这个机构在医疗体系中的位置和作用必须要进一步得到加强。
What this paper is trying to point out is that if a country has to have an agency for disease prevention and control, and the responsibility for disease control now rests with the CDC, its place and role in the health care system must be further strengthened.
无论它是一个科研机构还是一个政策执行机构，都需要获得更多的资源和话语权，才有可能遏制住下一个大规模传播的传染病。
Whether it is a scientific institution or a policy enforcement agency, it needs more resources and a voice if it is to contain the next large-scale epidemic.
