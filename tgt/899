本报记者 陈婷 张家振 武汉报道截至1月22日，此前在华南海鲜市场打工的王伟（化名）已在武汉市金银潭医院（武汉市医疗救治中心）接受治疗了22天。
Our reporter Chen Ting Zhang Jia Zhen Wuhan reported that as of January 22, Wang Wei (not his real name), who had been working in the South China seafood market, had been treated for 22 days at the Jiantan Hospital in Wuhan.
王伟是感染此次武汉不明肺炎的患者之一，1月17日，王伟被正式转入观察病房。
Wang Wei, one of the victims of the Wuhan unidentified pneumonia, was transferred to the observation ward on January 17.
现在的他，已经可以独自下楼打水，感觉身上渐渐有了力气。
Now he, has been able to go downstairs alone to fetch water, feel the body gradually have the strength.
1月21日，王伟及其大姐王燕（化名）再次接受了《中国经营报》记者的采访，讲述其治病经过及心路历程。
On January 21, Wang Wei and his elder sister Wang Yan (alias) gave another interview with the China Business Daily, telling the story of his treatment and the course of his heart.
无力承担医药费1月3日，记者初见到王燕时，她正提着一箱牛奶和些许日常用品来到武汉市金银潭医院住院部南四楼，在拍打了几下安全通道的常闭门后，一位穿着卫生防护服的医务人员询问了一句是给几床的病人之后，接下东西便关上了门。
She was carrying a crate of milk and a few groceries when she arrived on the fourth floor of the hospital in Wuhan's Gold and Silver Pool Hospital on January 3. After patting the safe passages behind closed doors, a medical man in a health suit asked a few patients about the bed and then closed the door.
王燕彼时告诉记者，王伟于2019年12月31日下午两点从华中科技大学同济医学院附属同济医院（以下简称“同济医院”）转入武汉市金银潭医院，入住该院住院部南四楼。
Wang told reporters that Wang Wei was transferred from Tongji Hospital (Tongji Hospital) of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology at 2: 00 p.m. on December 31, 2019. He was transferred from Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
王伟大概在2019年12月16日或17日开始出现发烧症状，在家里“挺了8天”之后，因持续高烧约40摄氏度才住进了武汉市第六医院。
Wang, who developed fever on December 16 or 17, 2019, was admitted to Wuhan Sixth Hospital after spending eight days at home with a high fever of about 40 degrees Celsius.
王伟回忆道，最初自己感觉身体有些发热，伴有咳嗽。
At first, he felt a little feverish and coughed, Wang recalled.
严重时，在武汉市第六医院出现高烧、意识不清醒的状况。
In severe cases, high fever and unconsciousness occurred in Wuhan Sixth Hospital.
“那时候烧得都不认人了，两天都犯迷糊。
It was too hot to be recognized at that time, and I was bewildered for two days.
”王伟说。
"said Wang Wei.
那时候的他，时常吃不进东西，只能吃流食，依靠输液进行退烧。
At that time, he often did not eat into the food, can only eat fluid, rely on infusion to reduce fever.
在武汉市六医院时，王燕还能一直在王伟身边进行照顾。
In Wuhan City six hospitals, Wang Yan can still be around Wang Wei to take care of.
彼时，医务人员便开始询问王伟是哪里上班，王伟对其称是在华南海鲜市场打工，“从未隐瞒过”。
At that time, medical staff began to ask Wang Wei where he works, Wang Wei said he was working in the South China seafood market, "never hid."
王伟今年44岁，在武汉华南海鲜批发市场一家经营带鱼、黄鱼、鱿鱼等海鲜冻品的档口打工，每天凌晨4点钟上班，傍晚5点下班，主要工作是搬运冻品，对所经营冻品的来源并不清楚。
Wang Wei, 44, works at a seafood stall in Wuhan South China Wholesale Seafood Market, which handles frozen seafood such as fish, yellow fish and squid. He works at 4 a.m. and 5 p.m. everyday.
王燕说，因为常年搬运冻品，弟弟的双手已经变得有些僵硬麻木了。
Wang Yan said his brother's hands had become a little stiff and numb from years of moving frozen food.
2019年12月24日这天，王伟被转送至同济医院。
On 24 December 2019, Wang Wei was transferred to Tongji Hospital.
“12月24日住到医院里，当天医生通过CT拍片，发现弟弟的肺部出现近1/3面积的白色阴影，到了12月27日白色阴影面积扩散至2/3，随即要求我们转院。
"When I arrived at the hospital on December 24, my doctor took a CT scan and found that my brother's lungs were shaded by nearly a third of the white area. By December 27, the area of white shadow had spread to two-thirds.
”王燕如是说。
"said Wang Yan.
与此同时，王伟做了一项名为“病原微生物NGS检测”的院外检查。
At the same time, Wang Wei made an out-of-hospital examination called "NGS Detection of Pathogenic Microorganisms."
王燕向记者提供的“病原微生物NGS检测”院外检查费用收据王伟说，当时医生并没有在其面前说明疾病的详细情况，只说“这个医院（指武汉市金银潭医院）是专治这种病的”，要求王伟转院。
Wang told reporters that doctors did not give details of the disease in front of him, saying "this hospital is only for this disease" and asked Wang Wei to refer him to hospital.
据王伟描述，此时的他已经没有了高烧的症状，“自己感觉好转了但还是要转院”。
According to Wang Wei, at this time he has no symptoms of high fever, "I feel better but still have to transfer hospital."
王伟戴着呼吸机被送到了武汉市金银潭医院，由于院方对病人和家属进行隔离，王燕再没见过弟弟，王伟也开始了独自一人照顾自己的治病时光。
Wang Wei, wearing a respirator, was taken to Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital. As the hospital separated the patient from his family, Wang Yan never saw his brother again.
刚入院时，王伟感觉住院环境比较简陋，伙食跟不上。
At the time of admission, Wang Wei felt that the hospital environment was relatively rudimentary and the food was inadequate.
王伟描述，早上基本上一勺稀饭和一个馒头，中午和晚上吃得比较多的是素菜。
Wang described a spoonful of porridge and a steamed bun in the morning and vegetarian dishes for lunch and the evening.
王燕向记者提供王伟拍摄的武汉市金银潭医院伙食照片（改善前）到了2020年1月3日左右，王伟告诉王燕，医院伙食有了改善。
Wang Yan provided photos of the catering service at Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital taken by Wang Wei. By around January 3, 2020, Wang Wei told Wang Yan that hospital meals had improved.
早上除了稀饭还有馒头、花卷，中午的盒饭还有酸奶、炒藕片、萝卜炖排骨等饭菜。
In addition to porridge in the morning and steamed bread, rolls, lunch box rice and yogurt, fried lotus root slices, radish stew ribs and other dishes.
王燕向记者提供王伟拍摄的武汉市金银潭医院伙食照片（改善后）与此同时，王燕在工作之余仍抽出时间来给王伟捎带物品，包括一些营养保健品。
Wang provided a photo of the catering service at Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital taken by Wang Wei. Meanwhile, Wang Yan took time out of work to bring some things to Wang Wei, including some nutritional care products.
王燕告诉记者，医生跟王伟说：“这个病目前没有特效药，靠自身的免疫很重要。
Wang Yan told reporters, doctors and Wang Wei said: "This disease does not have specific drugs, relying on their own immunity is very important.
”所以王燕和妹妹就准备了许多提高免疫力和抵抗力的保健品，鼓励王伟多吃一些补充能量。
So Wang Yan and his sister prepared many health products to improve immunity and resistance, encouraging Wang Wei-do to eat some supplementary energy.
王伟在武汉市金银潭医院治病期间，主要的治疗靠输液为主，一开始每天要打7瓶药，包括白蛋白等药物。
Wang Wei in Wuhan City during the treatment of gold and silver pool hospital, the main treatment depends on infusion, starting with a daily dose of seven bottles of medicine, including albumin and other drugs.
王伟说，他和妻子一直在武汉租房子住，他在华南海鲜市场打工一个月的工资是5000元，事实上，扣去每个月的饭钱和交通补贴，一个月能拿到手的只有3000多元。
Mr. Wang says he and his wife have been renting houses in Wuhan, and that he earns 5,000 yuan a month as a part-time seafood market in southern China.
自从住进了医院，王伟就没有了经济收入来源。
Ever since he was admitted to the hospital, Wang Wei has had no source of income.
1月3日，记者见到王燕那天，除了给弟弟和隔壁床病人捎带物品之外，王燕又向武汉市金银潭医院预交了1万元住院费，而在此前三天，已在金银潭医院共计花去4000元。
On January 3, the reporter saw Wang Yan that day, in addition to the younger brother and the next bed patients to bring supplies, Wang Yan to Wuhan City gold and silver Tan Hospital pre-paid 10,000 yuan hospital fees, the previous three days, the total has spent a total of 4,000 dollars.
“现在弟弟已经没有钱治病了，是我们两个姐姐在帮忙凑钱。
"Now my brother has no money to treat his illness. It is our two sisters who are helping to collect the money.
”王燕说，据其了解，在武汉市金银潭医院住院的病人大多是出苦力打工的，很多人东拼西凑，到处借钱治病。
According to his knowledge, most of the patients hospitalized at the gold and silver pool hospital in Wuhan were laborers, with many scrambling around to borrow money for medical treatment.
“起码儿子懂事多了”王伟记得，来到武汉市金银潭医院的第四天，就可以开始不用呼吸机了；1月15日，医务人员开始给他减药，也撤掉了氧气机。
"At least the son had more sense." Wang remembered coming to Wuhan City on the fourth day of the gold and silver pool hospital, so that he could start without a ventilator; January 15, medical staff began to give him a drug reduction, also removed the oxygen machine.
现在，王伟仍在观察病房内进行后期治疗，医生定期为其检查体温，输液的药品从7瓶降到了1瓶，为护肝药。
Now, Wang Wei is still in the observation ward for follow-up treatment, doctors regularly check his body temperature, infusion from seven bottles to a bottle, for liver care.
同时，王伟也能独自下楼打水，感觉身体比以前有力了。
At the same time, Wang Wei was able to go downstairs and fetch water alone, feeling stronger than before.
自1月13日最后一次发烧以来，王伟也再没出现过发烧。
Since his last fever on January 13, Wang Wei has not had a fever since.
截至1月22日，王伟尚未接到出院通知，医生告诉他：“肝脏还有些问题，转氨酶很高，暂时不能出院。
As of January 22, Wang Wei has not yet received a discharge notice, the doctor told him: "The liver is still some problems, high transaminase, temporarily unable to leave the hospital.
”在王伟患病期间，王燕称家属一直都没有被隔离，只有社区卫生院的人从王伟进院开始每天打电话给王燕和妹妹做回访，询问的问题大概是有没有感冒发烧，一直到1月18日社区卫生院的人上门给王燕等家属量体温，说14天已经过了，确定没有发烧之后就没再给王燕打电话了。
"During Wang Wei's illness, Wang said the family had never been quarantined. Only the residents of the community health centre called Wang Yan and his sister every day from Wang Wei's hospital.
王伟说：“现在的心情好多了，观察病房里的病友们情况也都有所好转，有一个已经出院了，所以我也不会太担心。
"I feel much better now," Wang said. "The patients in the observation ward are getting better. One of them is out of the hospital, so I won't worry too much.
我觉得我还是蛮幸运的一个，生病的时候有姐姐们给我送各种东西。
I think I was lucky to have my sisters give me all kinds of things when I was sick.
”王燕和弟弟王伟一家是东北人，在武汉落地扎根了20余年。
Wang Yan and his younger brother, Wang Wei's family, were from the northeast and landed in Wuhan for more than 20 years.
王伟和妻子育有一子，也在武汉打工，但没有同住一个屋檐下。
Wang Wei and his wife had a son who also worked in Wuhan, but did not live under the same roof.
王燕说，侄子在王伟生病前很少给王伟打电话，自从王伟生病住院后，便开始天天给王伟打电话。
Wang Yan said his nephew rarely called Wang Wei before he was ill. Since Wang Wei was ill in hospital, he has been calling Wang Wei every day.
王伟曾对王燕说：“摊上这个事也值了，起码儿子懂事多啦！知道关心爸爸了。
Wang Wei once said to Wang Yan: "Stalls on this matter also worth, at least the son has a lot of understanding! Know to care about father.
”王伟也告诉记者，现在儿子经常给自己打电话，有时候也会视频。
Wang Wei also told reporters that his son now often calls himself and sometimes videos.
王伟说：“孩子挺孝顺的，自己病好了之后想马上回家。
"The child is filial and wants to go home as soon as he is well," Wang said.
”王燕则说，本来是打算回老家过春节的，但因为弟弟住院了，便取消了这个行程。
Wang said she had planned to go back to her hometown for the Spring Festival, but cancelled the trip because her brother was in hospital.
另一方面，王伟对于工作的打算是等待华南海鲜市场重新开张，但如果持续关闭，自己也会继续留在武汉找其他工作。
Mr. Wang, on the other hand, plans to wait for the South China seafood market to reopen, but will stay in Wuhan to find other jobs if the closure continues.
而据此前王燕的描述，王伟在华南海鲜市场的工作环境不容乐观。
According to the former Wang Yan's description, Wang Wei in the South China seafood market working environment is not optimistic.
“市场常年脏乱差，我每次去都要捂着鼻子，可即便这样，市场的客流量依旧可观，因为价格便宜。
"The market is always messy, I always go to cover the nose, but even so, the market traffic is still considerable, because the price is cheap.
”王伟介绍称，市场分东西区，其所在的西区有十几家贩售野味的商户，包括野鸭、蛇、野兔等，位置偏僻。
Wang said the western part of the market, which is divided between east and west, has a dozen venison traders, including wild ducks, snakes and rabbits, and is isolated.
“卖的东西有些我都不认得，每天去买的人也不少。
"I don't know some of the things I sell, and I go to buy a lot of people every day.
”此外，近段时间以来，王燕也忙于为王伟的医药费报销事项而奔走。
In addition, Wang Yan has been busy lately trying to pay for Wang Wei's medical bills.
1月10日，王燕向记者提供的退款凭证显示，当天上午10点多，武汉市金银潭医院已分两次向其退还了共计1.2万元，其中一笔为1万元，另一笔为2000元。
A refund voucher provided by Wang to reporters on January 10 showed that the gold and silver pool hospital in Wuhan had returned to her 12,000 yuan (US $10,000) in two instalments, one for 10,000 yuan and the other for 2,000 yuan.
“我通过微信一共交了12000元，另外2000元是我妹妹垫付的，这笔费用医院也一起退还了，但当时她是刷的信用卡，得一个月以后才能到账。
"I paid 12,000 yuan by micromail, and 2,000 yuan was advanced by my sister. The hospital returned the money, but it was a credit card she had brushed and it would not arrive until a month later.
”王燕告诉记者，目前其妹妹还没有收到这笔2000元的退款。
Wang told reporters that her sister had not yet received a refund of 2,000 yuan.
王燕此前告诉记者，加上在前两个医院的治疗开销，王燕一家共花费约4.3万元。
Wang Yan previously told reporters, plus the cost of treatment in the first two hospitals, Wang Yan's family spent about 43,000 yuan.
1月21日，记者从国家医疗保障局获悉，针对此次疫情特点，对确诊为新型冠状病毒感染肺炎等患者采取特殊报销政策。
On January 21, the reporter learned from the National Medical Security Bureau, according to the characteristics of the epidemic, the diagnosis of a new coronavirus pneumonia and other patients adopted a special reimbursement policy.
对此，王燕向记者表示：“这个消息太好了！”（编辑：曹学平 校对：颜京宁）。
