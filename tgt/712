这个春节有点囧口述/陈老板（温州一餐厅负责人）在车上睡了15个晚上，昨晚11点多，我终于洗上了热水澡，躺在了温州永嘉县隔离点的床上。
After 15 nights in the car, I finally got a hot bath and was lying in bed at the Yongjia County quarantine point in Wenzhou.
感谢永嘉县委！真舒服啊。
Thanks to Yongjia County Commissary! How comfortable it is!
▲现在胡子拉碴的我01又疲又乏的我，总算在永嘉落下了脚昨晚7点13分，在辗转两个出入口被拒后，我来到温州东，顺利下高速。
Now Hu Zi ballastful I 01 and tired, I finally fell in Yongjia last night 7: 13, after tossing and turning two entrances were rejected, I came to Wenzhou East, smooth down the highway.
我想导航去我的餐厅，导航让我掉头上温州东高速。
I want to navigate to my restaurant and navigate my way up the Wenzhou East Expressway.
气得我啊。
I'm mad at you.
导航上显示到处都是叉叉，到处都封路，什么玩意儿啊，我干脆关了导航。
The navigation shows forks all over the place, roads are blocked everywhere, what the hell? I just shut down the navigation.
毕竟也在温州生活15年，我凭记忆开到瓯越大桥。
After all, I lived in Wenzhou for 15 years and I reached the Ouyue Bridge by memory.
刚准备上桥，一个工作人员就把我拦住了。
Just as I was about to get on the bridge, an office worker stopped me.
我说，我上饶过来的，这是身份证和健康证明。
I said, I saved my life. Here's the ID card and the health certificate.
他盯着我看了几秒钟，挥挥手说：“下去，下去吧。
He stared at me for a few seconds, waving his hand and saying, "Get down, get down.
”我赶紧开走了。
I hastened away.
哪里知道过了大桥，没开几分钟，又遇上卡口。
No one knows where to cross the bridge. I didn't drive for a few minutes.
检查登记好，几个交警说，你这种情况必须返回。
Check it out and several traffic police say you have to go back in this situation.
我说我实在走不了了，温州才是我的家，我现在又累又乏，心跳加速。
I said I really can not go, Wenzhou is my home, I am tired and tired, heart beat fast.
交警听完我的讲述，打了一通电话，让我先坐一会儿。
After listening to my story, the traffic police made a phone call and asked me to sit down for a while.
他给我泡了一碗方便面，另外一位交警给我拿了橘子。
He made me a bowl of instant noodles, and another policeman brought me oranges.
他们还说，要是我早点过来，还能跟他们一起吃饭，现在太晚了就只有泡面了。
They also said that if I had come earlier, I could have dined with them. It would be too late now.
我把车靠边停下，在车里等。
I pulled over and waited in the car.
在车上漂太久了，如果再让我回去，我真的会崩溃，身体也实在是吃不消了。
Floating in the car too long, if let me go back, I really will collapse, the body is really too much.
交警一直在打电话，还三次走过来查看我的情况。
The traffic police have been on the phone and have come to check on me three times.
交警安慰我：“你别急，我们在想办法，县委很关注你这个事，争取让你今晚就回乐清。
Traffic police consoled me: "Don't worry, we are trying to find a way, the county party is very concerned about this matter, to let you go back to Yuqing tonight.
”在路上漂了这么久，听到这样的话真的蛮感动的。
"It was really touching to hear such words after so long a journey.
我等了一个多小时。
I waited for over an hour.
今天开了一整天车了，这是我最后一根救命稻草。
I've been driving all day. It's my last straw.
他们最后又走过来，一个交警说：“县里考虑到你这种精神状态和身体状况，再回去的话怕出事。
At last they came near again, and one of the traffic policemen said, "The county, considering your mental and physical condition, will be afraid of anything if you go back.
所以特批你今晚就在永嘉隔离，不过还是要收取一定费用的。
That's why you'll be quarantined at Yongjia tonight, but you'll have to pay a fee.
”感谢领导们，你们心肠太好了！02洗了澡，我还想刮胡子晚上11点多，警车开道带着我来到了永嘉的隔离点，是幢三四层的小楼，听说是以前的人武部。
"Thank you, leaders, you have a wonderful heart! 02 bath, I want to shave more than 11 pm, the police car drove me to the Yongjia isolation point, a three or four-story building, I heard it was the former Ministry of Military Affairs.
门口医生已经在等着我了，登记好资料量好体温，他们带着我到了住处，还发给我一个体温计，让每天测好报群里。
The doctor at the door was waiting for me, checking in my temperature, they took me to my apartment, and they gave me a thermometer to take every day.
“后面14天就住这里吧，有需要就群里说。
"" Stay here for the next 14 days, "he said, referring to the group if necessary.
”屋子大概十几平方米，有电视和空调，设施稍微老旧了点，跟我餐厅所在的酒店肯定不能比。
The room is about a dozen square meters, TV and air-conditioning, and the facilities are a bit old and certainly not comparable to the hotel where I own the restaurant.
我把东西一放好，第一件事就是去洗澡。
As soon as I put my things away, the first thing I do is take a shower.
有热水真好啊。
It's good to have hot water.
我还想找个刮胡刀，十几天没刮胡子，太邋遢了。
I'm looking for a razor. I haven't shaved in ten days. It's too messy.
▲以前刮过胡子的我今天早上8点我就起来了，电话一直不断。
I got up at 8 this morning after shaving, and the phone kept buzzing.
我想测个体温，刚拿出来，一个电话，挂了之后体温计就不知道哪里去了。
I want to take a temperature. I just took it out, a phone, hung up the thermometer and I don't know where.
刚找到准备再量，电话又来了。
No sooner had I found my way back to work than the phone came back.
都10点多了，我体温还没报上去，他们要催我了。
It's past ten o'clock. I haven't got my temperature up yet. They're pushin 'me.
早饭是直接挂门口的。
Breakfast is hung directly by the door.
一个包子、一个面包、一个鸡蛋、一杯豆浆，挺好。
A steamed bun, a loaf of bread, an egg and a glass of soya-bean milk.
吃住都解决了。
Food and shelter have been provided.
03生意损失惨重，疫情过后再战接下来14天我要考虑三件事情，一个是我回温州会不会被传染，命毕竟是最重要的，我身体弱啊。
Business losses, the next 14 days after the outbreak of war I have to consider three things, one is whether I return to Wenzhou will be infected, life is the most important, I am weak ah.
我该怎么样更好保护自己？一个是14天后怎么办？朋友们说，乐清封了，14天后我可能也回不去。
How can I better protect myself? One is 14 days later? My friends say Yueqing is sealed, and I may not be able to go back 14 days later.
一个是我的生意怎么办？现在还有七八个员工被隔离着，餐厅也关了，根本没法开工。
What about my business? There are still seven or eight employees in quarantine, and the restaurant is closed and unable to start work at all.
生意做不成，他们的饭我肯定还是要给他们吃的，每天都要支出。
Business can not be done, their meals I must still give them food, every day has to spend.
▲以前的我实话不瞒你，这次过年我没回安徽老家或者四川我老婆那里，也是因为今年做生意亏了，没脸回家，才去朋友那边散散心。
Before I tell you the truth, this New Year I did not return to Anhui home or my wife in Sichuan, but also because this year's business losses, no face to go home, just go friends there to relax.
我是个自尊心很强的人啊，总想着要衣锦还乡。
I'm a very self-respecting person. I always want to get back in shape.
现在因为肺炎这个事，生意就更没法做了。
Now business is more difficult because of pneumonia.
20年前，我当过纺织厂工人，也踩过三轮车，因为身体差，都干不长。
Twenty years ago, I worked as a textile mill worker and stepped on a tricycle because my health was poor and I couldn't work long.
后来亲戚介绍我去餐馆打工，我聪明又肯干，15天就当上了班长，2个月不到就学会了养海鲜。
Later my relatives introduced me to a restaurant for a part-time job. I was smart and willing to work. I became a monitor in 15 days and learned to keep seafood in less than 2 months.
亲戚说，温州是个大城市，我这么聪明的人应该去大城市发展，我就从安徽来了温州。
Relatives said Wenzhou is a big city, I so smart people should go to the big city development, I came from Anhui Province Wenzhou.
我去五六家餐馆当海鲜池的学徒，学本事。
I went to five or six restaurants as an apprentice in a seafood pond.
▲我给自己举了手后来就发现，已经没什么可学了，我给自己举了手，说：“出师了！”后来就有人来挖我了，XX大酒店的总经理专门用车请了我三次，我终于去了。
I raised my hand to myself and found that there was nothing to learn. I raised my hand and said, "Teacher!" Later someone came to dig for me, XX hotel's general manager asked me three times special car, I finally went.
我开始搞承包，承包餐厅的海鲜池和后厨，从一家店发展到二十家店，最火的时候，我一个月可以赚十几万。
I started contracting, contracting out the restaurant's seafood pool and back kitchen, from one shop to twenty, and at its peak, I could make tens of thousands of dollars a month.
钱在袋里还没捂热，又遇上经济不好，我的店从十几家慢慢缩到几家。
Money in the bag is not covered with heat, and a bad economy, my shop from a dozen or so slowly to a few.
这几年由于种种原因，现在我只剩三家店了，欠了一点债务。
For a variety of reasons in recent years, I now have only three stores, a little debt.
两个月前，我跟几个朋友又花一百多万投资了家餐厅，现在血本无归，准备的新鲜澳洲大龙虾都只能放进冷库，而且根本没人要买了。
Two months ago, a couple of friends and I invested more than a million dollars in a restaurant. Now we're out of money, and we have fresh Australian lobsters that can only be stored in cold storage and nobody wants to buy them at all.
不过我也没有太悲观。
But I'm not too pessimistic either.
在这个行业，我还是专业的，专业的人要想翻身，只要努力了就不会太难。
In this industry, I am still professional, professional people want to turn over, as long as the effort will not be too difficult.
我会好起来的。
I'll be fine.
谢谢你们关心。
Thank you for your concern.
