These malls put up a circle of security lines, guide the entrance of the people sweep code and temperature, shopping mall staff also spray disinfectant.
九洲轻纺城一家店主潘茹告诉界面新闻，整个商圈分批复工，3月11日还会有一批商城开工。
Jiuzhou light spinning city shop owner Panju told the interface news, the whole business circle batch returned to work, March 11 there will be a number of commercial cities.
根据她的观察，已经开市的几家商城开市率达到90%，但每日营业时间有所减少，整体客流比此前减少了一半。
Several of the malls that have opened have opened 90 per cent of the market, according to her observations, but daily business hours have fallen and overall traffic has halved.

“我们面对的客户主要是服装公司、淘宝店主等过来挑面料的人，他们一定要在实地接触面料才能选择，由于门店无法开业，也就意味着无法正常接单。
"Our customers are mainly clothing companies, Taobao shop owners and other people over to pick up the fabric, they have to contact the fabric in the field to choose, because the store can not open, which means that the normal order.
”潘茹表示，面对老客户，他们会在网上接单，但仍然无法挽救多少业绩，“这部分客户的比例不大，我们要接触新客户。
Mr Panjou says that in the face of old customers, they will pick up orders online but still won't be able to save much.
”广州国际轻纺城内部，客流量比以往减少一半。
Inside Guangzhou International Light Spindle City, passenger traffic is down by half.
图片来源：吴容由于需要陈列大量的布样供采购商选择，潘茹的商铺面积接近20平方米，高企的租金占到其支出的最大比重。
Photo source: Wu Rong because of the need to display a large number of fabric samples for buyers to choose, Panju shop area close to 20 square meters, high rent accounted for the largest share of its expenditure.
这也是潘茹2月休市至今面临的最头疼的事，“广州海珠区这边铺租不便宜，平均来说都要5万元。
This is also Panju February so far face the most headache, "Guangzhou Haizhu District on this side of the shop rent is not cheap, on average want 50,000 yuan.

”林涛同样表现被动。

他的门店在广州国际轻纺城二楼，也并未收到减租通知。

由于业务较多，年前他聘请了6个员工，但现在返工的只有两人，且都为广东本地人。
He hired six employees a year ago because of his heavy business, but only two are now reworking, all from Guangdong.
眼下林涛还得操心如何招工，“中大纺织商圈外来打工的有15万人，其中湖北籍的人员就占了三分之一，他们大多来自荆州、仙桃等地，因为疫情他们现在不能回来。
At present, Lin Tao has to worry about how to recruit workers. "There are 150,000 migrant workers in the textile business circle of CUHK, one third of whom are Hubei. Most of them come from Jingzhou and Xiantao.
”商家贴出招聘广告。

图片来源：吴容事实上，以往每到春节过后，中大轻纺市场都会面临招工难问题。
Photo source: Wu Rong in fact, after every Spring Festival in the past, the textile market will face recruitment difficulties.
林涛透露，今年受到疫情影响，招工难会因为湖北工人无法返穗而变本加厉，“现在客流量不多勉强能顶住，慢慢（客流）上来了，各个店铺大家要用人，大家都会提高20-%-30%薪水来招揽人才。
Lin Tao revealed that this year by the impact of the epidemic, recruitment difficulties will be Hubei workers can not return to the spike, "traffic is not enough to withstand the current, slowly (passenger flow) up, every shop people want to employ, everyone will increase 20-% -30% of salary to recruit.
