作者 | 赵烨楠编辑 | 罗立璇1月24日，中国春节的大年三十、武汉“封城”的第二天。
Ro Yuanan, editor and vice versa, was the day after the 30th anniversary of the Chinese New Year and the second day of the Wuhan Lunar New Year.
在大量患者涌向医院的情况下，一切物资都在告急。
With so many patients flocking to the hospital, everything was in a hurry.
在这一天，包括武汉在内的多个湖北城市的医院，不顾可能存在的“组织”风险，都开始分散式地向民间大声疾呼：他们需要护目镜、防护服、医用口罩……等一切能够保证他们还在前线奋战的物资。
On this day, hospitals in many Hubei cities, including Wuhan, began to speak out to the public in a decentralized manner, regardless of possible "organizational" risks: They need goggles, protective clothing, medical masks... and everything to keep them fighting on the front lines.
面对前线的求援，民间力量正在凝聚，来自天南地北的志愿者们在网络上联系起来，快速形成志愿组织，他们的目标都指向一致：无论以什么形式，一定要帮助到医院。
In the face of front-line calls for help, civic forces are coming together, volunteers from far and wide are networking and forming volunteer groups quickly, all with the same goal: to help hospitals, in whatever form.
其中有一批程序员，选择使用自己掌握的技术和能力，帮助自己生活的这个城市。
One group of programmers chose to use their skills and abilities to help the city in which they lived.
阿凯、老彭、阿伟平时在武汉光谷软件园工作。
Akai, Lao Pen and Wei usually work in Guanggu Software Park in Wuhan.
面对不断涌现的医院需求和找不到对接的物资，他们决定，建立一个医用物资信息的对接平台，来改善钱和物的流通方式。
Confronted with the surging demand for hospitals and the lack of docking materials, they decided to set up a docking platform for information on medical supplies to improve the flow of money and materials.
到现在，已经有十几位朋友一同加入进来，组织着这个平台的运转。
Up to now, a dozen friends have joined in to organize the operation of the platform.
而参与其中的志愿者、捐助方还要更多。
And more volunteers and donors are involved.
每个人发挥着自己的作用，他们没有见过彼此，但互相信任。
Everyone plays their part. They don't see each other, but they trust each other.
他们在网络上一起协作，完成着这个物资对接平台的建设与运营。
They work together on the network to complete the construction and operation of the material docking platform.
这是一场正在发生的、且发生在这个时代的民间援助故事。
This is a folk aid story that is happening and is happening at this time.
一群人，关心一件事西安人白灏没有心情观看春晚，一直在手机上刷着武汉疫情的相关消息。
A group of people, concerned about a matter Xi'an Bai Hai is in no mood to watch the Spring Festival Gala, has been brushing Wuhan-related mobile phone epidemic information.
这是新型冠状病毒肺炎由钟南山在央视上确认“人传人”消息的第四天。
This is the new coronavirus pneumonia from Zhong Nan Shan CCTV confirmed the "person-to-person" message on the fourth day.
这天晚上，他看到朋友圈有人发了“为武汉加油”的志愿者群，他马上点二维码加了进去。
That night, he saw a group of friends sent "cheer for Wuhan" volunteers, he immediately ordered two-dimensional code added.
当天，武汉协和医院、湖北省人民医院、武汉大学中南医院等等数十家医院都发出公告，恳请社会各界伸出援手。
On the same day, Wuhan Heping Hospital, Hubei Provincial People's Hospital, Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital and dozens of other hospitals issued notices, asking the community to lend a helping hand.
这些信息过于庞杂，想要捐助的人也很多。
The information is too complex and there are many people who want to contribute.
许多经过二手转发的医院信息、捐助信息难以被核实和完成顺畅的对接。
Many second-hand forwarded hospital information, donor information is difficult to verify and complete the smooth docking.
那天晚上，白灏加入的这个群，讨论声一直没有停息。
That night, the discussion of the group, which White Ham had joined, continued unabated.
很多人在群里转发了这些医院的捐赠公告，天南地北的志愿者，无论在不在武汉，都在群里讨论着，希望出一份力。
Many people in the group forwarded the announcement of the donation of these hospitals, North and South volunteers, whether in Wuhan or not, are in the group to discuss, hope to play a part.
武汉人老彭的想法更加迫切。
Wuhan people Lao Peng's idea is more urgent.
老彭是一名软件工程师，在光谷软件园的一家科技公司工作。
Mr. Peng is a software engineer who works for a technology company at the Valley Software Park.
“光谷”的正式名称是东湖新技术开发区，在2001年被原国家计委、科技部批准为国家光电子产业基地，从而获得别称：“中国光谷”。
In 2001, the former State Planning Commission and the Ministry of Science and Technology approved it as the national optoelectronic industry base, thus obtaining the nickname "China Light Valley."
在今天，它已经成为武汉的互联网中心，坐落着包括微软、华为、小米、科大讯飞，和小红书等几百家海内外高新企业的分部及武汉本土创新企业。
Today, it has become Wuhan's Internet center, located in Microsoft, Huawei, millet, HKUST fly, and Xiaohong book hundreds of high-tech enterprises at home and abroad as well as Wuhan local innovative enterprises.
自23号武汉“封城”以后，老彭和同事都在家里自我隔离，哪儿也去不了。
Since the 23 Wuhan "closure", Lao Pen and his colleagues have been isolated at home, can not go anywhere.
“封城”第二天的物资告急，他们都看在眼里。
"Sealing" the next day's supplies are urgent, they see.
他和同事在公司群里讨论着，觉得可以利用自己的职业帮助他们，让物资对接变得更加高效。
He and his colleagues discussed it in the company group and felt they could use their careers to help them dock more efficiently.
老彭在自己公司的群里@了设计、@了研发，问这件事是否可行，他们的回答是：当然可以。
Lao Pang in his company's group @ design, @ research and development, to ask if this thing is feasible, their answer is: Of course.
25号凌晨刚过，他发了一条朋友圈，希望更多的朋友能参与进来，一起帮忙。
Just after the morning of the 25th, he sent out a circle of friends, hoping that more friends would join him and help.
看到这条朋友圈的人把他和同事拉到了白灏所在的志愿者群。
People who saw this circle of friends dragged him and his colleagues to White Ham's volunteer corps.
老彭对大家说，他们可以帮忙搭建一个H5形式的信息平台，方便医院与捐赠方对接。
Peng told the group that they could help set up an information platform in the form of H5 to facilitate the docking of hospitals with donors.
群里的朋友们反应很热烈，希望自己也能帮一把。
The friends in the group reacted enthusiastically and wished they could help.
白瀚就是在这时主动加了老彭，想尽自己能力帮一点忙。
It is at this time that Bai took the initiative to add Lao Peng, trying to do their best to help a little.
一晚上的时间内，职责正在快速分配中，白瀚马上成为了这个信息平台团队的媒体对接人。
Over the course of a night, responsibilities are being rapidly distributed, and Bai instantly becomes the media interface for the information platform team.
那天晚上，加老彭和他的同事的人很多很多——“我在北京做产品经理，武汉人”“我能做java，15年从武汉毕业”“我是做UI设计的，想加入”。
That night, there were a lot of people at Ga Lao Pen and his workersI worked as a product manager in Beijing, Wuhan people. I could do java and graduate from Wuhan in 15 years.
一时间，远在不同地方的朋友通过这件事聚集到了一起。
For a time, friends from far away places gathered together through this event.
他们都是网友，从来没见过面。
They're all netizens. They've never met.
白瀚说，“我们对彼此都不是很了解，但在这个事情上很快凝聚了起来”。
"We don't know much about each other, but we quickly coalesce around this," he said.
到25号凌晨两点多的时候，基本的人员架构已经完成。
By 2: 00 a.m. on the 25th, the basic personnel structure had been completed.
老彭、阿凯、阿伟，同公司的三位同事成为搭建这个信息平台的主要负责人。
Lao Peng, Akai and Wei, together with three colleagues in the company, became the main person in charge of setting up the information platform.
阿凯负责技术，老彭负责运营，阿伟负责产品设计。
Akai is in charge of technology, Lao Pen is in charge of operations and Wei in product design.
老彭在朋友圈说，“我们预计会在今晚先把H5跑起来，过程中还会有大量需要做信息录入的工作量，到时候还要得到大家的帮助。
"We expect to start running H5 tonight," Mr. Peng said in a group of friends. "There will be a lot of paperwork and help.
”末尾他说了两遍：“非常感谢！”他们几个人一晚上没睡觉。
"At the end he said twice," Thank you very much! "and the group did not sleep all night.
到25号上午10点，短短7个多小时的时间内，物资对接平台的雏形已经搭建起来了。
By 10 a.m. on the 25th, in just over seven hours, the prototype of the docking platform had been built.
点进这个版本的链接中，已经能看到每家接受捐赠医院的详细信息，包括医院地址、联系电话、物资需求清单、防护物资标准与相关图片，还可以一键拨打医院留下的电话号码。
By clicking on this version of the link, you can already see the details of each donor hospital, including hospital address, contact phone number, inventory of material needs, standards of protective materials and related pictures, and can call the number left behind by the hospital.
每天都在更新中快速搭建起来的平台为医院与捐助方的快速对接提供了便利，并且每天都在进行信息的核实、更新和平台架构的迭代中。
The platform, which is rapidly being updated on a daily basis, facilitates rapid docking between hospitals and donors and is undergoing daily information verification, updating and iteration of the platform architecture.
这个平台的身后，是更多拥有相同目标的朋友，自愿承担起了不同的职责，为平台的运营努力着，也在不同群组中扩展着平台功能意义的外延。
Behind this platform are more friends with the same goals, volunteering to take on different responsibilities, working for the platform's operations, and extending the reach of the platform's functional meaning across different clusters.
小型的组织架构很快成型。
A small organizational structure takes shape quickly.
他们成立了统筹组进行不同职责间的分工与安排。
They set up a co-ordinating team to work out the division of responsibilities and arrangements between them.
产品组负责前端与后台的搭建与测试，平台功能的迭代；运营组负责医院数据的收集；客服组负责医院信息的核查，一个一个向医院打电话进行核实；还将医院方的负责人拉进一个群，进行需求的对接和更新。
The Product Group is responsible for front-end and back-office construction and testing, platform functional iterations; the Operations Group is responsible for the collection of hospital data; the Customer Service Unit is responsible for the verification of hospital information, calling hospitals one by one; and the head of the hospital is drawn into a group for the purpose of docking and updating needs.
越来越多的朋友加入了进来，这些“志愿者”不只以个人形式加入，还有公司。
More and more friends are joining, not just as individuals, but also as companies.
他们将医院信息的核实工作利用石墨文档整合到一起，方便随时添加和修改。
They integrate the verification of hospital information with graphite files for easy addition and modification at any time.
石墨文档的办公室就在老彭公司隔壁，一年前刚从字节跳动那里获得了近亿元人民币的融资。
The graphite file office is next door to Lao Peng, which received nearly Rmb1m in funding from byte jumps a year ago.
那边的热心同事很快联系到阿凯，为他们提供技术支持，并且免费向他们开放了VIP权限。
Enthusiastic colleagues there quickly contacted Mr. Akay to provide them with technical support and free VIP access.
为了信息准确度，在医院信息核实的优先级上，老彭他们以医院官方公众号、微博、网站发布的信息为先，其次是具有公信力的媒体发布的消息，接下来是博主、自媒体等转发的医院信息。
To determine the accuracy of the information, Lao Pang gave priority to official hospital public numbers, microblogs, websites and, to a lesser extent, credible media reports, followed by hospital information from bloggers, the media, etc.
26号凌晨，平台2.0版本上线了。
Early in the morning of 26, version 2.0 of the platform went live.
老彭在朋友圈发了这样一张平台信息海报。
Lao Pang distributed such a platform message poster in a circle of friends.
更新后，平台向公众开放了平台联系方式，更多朋友可以将自己了解的医院信息、捐助信息发送给平台，核实后再展示。
After the update, the platform opened the platform's contact information to the public, and more friends can send the hospital information and donation information they know to the platform for verification and display.
采访当天，平台上的医院信息分为“信息已核实”和少量的“信息未核实”状态，这些医院信息核实后会再进行修改。
On the day of the interview, hospital information on the platform was divided into "verified information" and a small number of "unverified information" status, which will be revised after verification.
“我们不想怀疑任何一个医院提出的需求”，老彭说，为了保证没有一家需要帮助的医院被遗漏，少数没有来得及核实的医院信息会先被放上平台，之后再进行逐步核实。
"We don't want to question the needs of any hospital," said Peng senior, adding that in order to ensure that no hospital in need of help was left out, the few hospital messages that had not been verified were placed on the platform before being progressively verified.
同时，2.0版本还上线了车辆资源信息。
At the same time, version 2.0 is available with vehicle resource information.
包括政府车辆、民间志愿者车辆与物流公司志愿车辆。
Includes Government vehicles, civilian volunteer vehicles and voluntary vehicles of logistics companies.
提供了联系方式、配送范围、配送时间等信息，虽然有些信息还并不完善。
Contact information, distribution range, delivery time and so on are provided, although some information is not perfect.
每个志愿者不计回报地忙上忙下，“各司其职”。
Each volunteer is busy doing his or her job, regardless of reward.
在他们的努力下，平台每天都在更新着，从前端信息到后台技术。
In their efforts, the platform is being updated every day, from front-end information to back-office technology.
到后来的3.0、4.0版本，分别通过医院的浏览量、联系次数对医院展示位置做了优先级排序；在平台系统和信息的安全性上做了升级，后台进行了加密，每条数据信息的来源也可追溯。
Later versions 3.0 and 4.0 prioritized hospital display locations by number of hospital views and contacts, upgraded platform systems and information security, encrypted back-office and traced the source of each data message.
医院证明公函、医疗机构执业许可证、捐赠公告也都一并添加，从繁重的人工审核逐渐变成了自动化审核。
Official hospital certificates, medical practice licenses, donation announcements are also added, from the heavy manual audit gradually into an automated audit.
今天，平台的4.0版本正式上线。
Today, version 4.0 of the platform went live.
截止今天，平台共审核上线了801家医院信息，66条车辆资源信息。
As of today, 801 hospital information and 66 vehicle resource information have been checked and approved by the platform.
与此同时，他们的组织还在不断壮大，陆续融合了很多其他的志愿者组织。
At the same time, their organization continues to grow, with the integration of many other volunteer organizations.
他们一起将这次临时聚集起来的公益组织命名为“E起支援”，希望能代表大家互联、互助的精神。
Together, they named the makeshift public-interest group "E Stand Up" in the hope of representing the spirit of interconnection and mutual assistance.
▲“E起支援”融合的其他公益组织白瀚说，许多医院已经通过平台收到了急需的物资捐赠，这些捐赠方包括许多海内外的华人和企业。
Other pro bono groups, E Up Support, say many hospitals have received much-needed material donations through the platform, including many Chinese and overseas Chinese and businesses.
而物资对接还正在持续进行中。
The docking of materials is ongoing.
疲惫、质疑与感动这几天，白瀚、老彭，这些志愿者中的很多人都没怎么睡好。
Weary, questioning and touched by these days, Bai, Lao Pen, many of these volunteers did not sleep well.
老彭从参与进来那天起，每天只睡两三个小时。
Lao Pen slept only two or three hours a day from the day he joined the group.
老彭的家人、朋友都有些心疼他。
Lao Pen's family and friends are a little distressed for him.
尤其是家人，“他们觉得我太累了”。
Especially the family, "They think I'm too tired."
可老彭说，投入进来后，身体反倒没有什么感知。
But when he threw it in, the body didn't feel anything, says Peng.
添加他微信的人每天都很多，直到“数字已经不提示了，变成了小红点”。
The people who added his message were numerous every day until "the numbers were gone and turned to red dot."
只要有需求的，他每条认真回复。
Whenever there was a need, he replied in earnest.
老彭把这项公益当成自己的工作在做。
Lao Pen takes this as his job.
白瀚也一样，昨晚到现在，他只“半梦半醒睡了两个小时”。
So is Bai, who has been "half asleep for two hours" since last night.
白瀚是一名话剧演员，在这几天中，他担起了媒体对接、文案写作等各种各样的活儿。
Bai is a drama actor, in the past few days, he took up the media docking, writing and other kinds of work.
今天凌晨，设计在出图，他怕文案跟不上，半夜睡睡醒醒地坚持把平台的文案写了出来。
Early this morning, the design in the map, he was afraid that the text can not keep up with sleep in the middle of the night awake insisted on the platform of the text.
26号，因为网站访问量太大。
Number 26, because of heavy traffic to the site.
网址被封了。
Website blocked.
腾讯看到他们做的事之后，也找到他们，为他们提供了网站域名支持。
Tencent saw what they had done and also found them, providing them with domain name support for their website.
做一件好事并不容易。
It is not easy to do a good deed.
即使他们中的每一个人都不参与任何资金、物资运作，仅参与信息平台本身的建设，质疑声还是跟了过来。
Even if each of them did not participate in any financial, material operation, only to participate in the construction of the information platform itself, the voice of doubt followed.
有人把他们的海报拿过去改了之后作假，当作自己筹资的宣传物料。
They had their posters altered and faked as propaganda material for their own fund-raising.
还有人加到他们核心成员的微信，拉到一个群里，和他讨论“之后的路该怎么走”，想拉他们一起商业化运营。
Others tweaked letters to their core members and dragged them into a group to discuss "the way forward" and try to commercialize them together.
他们核心成员只好在群里强调，“我们不碰钱，不碰物”。
"We don't touch money, we don't touch things.
对方马上回复，“那我们走的不是一条路”。
The other party immediately replied, "Then we are not going the same way."
这让他们觉得无可奈何，白瀚说，“也没有办法，什么样的人都有”。
It makes them feel helpless, he said. "There is no other way. There are all kinds of people."
同时，他们更加担心自己被误会，不想让一件好事变味儿。
At the same time, they worry more about being misunderstood and not wanting a good thing to taste.
不过，更多的人和事让他们感动。
But more people and things moved them.
这几天，陆续收到捐赠物资的医院人员在微信上向他们表达感谢。
In the past few days, hospital staff who have received donations have written to thank them.
一位医生向其中一位志愿者发语音说“我替我这些医护同胞们感谢你们做出的努力。
"I thank you, my fellow healthcare professionals, for your efforts," a doctor said to one of the volunteers.
”这让这些志愿者们觉得很感动。
"The volunteers were moved.
在采访中，白瀚跟我提到了三次“凝聚”这个词，这也是他这几天的最大感触。
In the interview, Bai mentioned to me the word "agglomeration" three times, which is his biggest feeling these days.
“我们所有人，用一个词来概括，就是凝聚”。
"All of us, summed up in one word, are condensed."
而老彭觉得，在这个事情一开始，他们就想到，这件事很可能没什么结果，或者会突然中断。
At the outset of the incident, Lao Pang thought, it was likely that it would be fruitless or abruptly interrupted.
“如果疫情结束，我们也结束了，这也是我们的初衷。
"If the epidemic is over, we are over, and that is what we intended it to be.
反正就先做嘛，不问结果，那些都不要紧。
Just do it first, regardless of the outcome, it doesn't matter.
