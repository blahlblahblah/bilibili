早春的武汉春风拂面，这两天接到爸妈打来的电话，询问我的近况。
Wuhan spring wind blowing in early spring, these two days received a phone call from my parents, asking me how I was doing.
我告诉他们我过得好着呢：吃着大餐、住着五星级的酒店。
I told them how I was doing: eating a big meal and staying in a five-star hotel.
其实，我特别想念妈妈蒸的馒头，就算只就着大蒜，我也能吃两个碗大的馍馍。
In fact, I missed mama steamed bun, even with garlic, I could eat two bowls of bun steamed bun.
口述 | 毛 平整理 | 沈 林昨天中午我吃到了久违的花卷，比泡面的滋味香多了。
At last noon yesterday, I had a long-awaited roll of flowers, much more delicious than noodles.
虽然我不太介意吃喝，但连续吃了快一个月的泡面，鼻子里似乎总闻到泡面的味道。
Although I don't mind eating and drinking very much, I've been eating noodles for almost a month in a row and my nose always smells like noodles.
山东到武汉，在平时，坐飞机只需要一个多小时，就算是火车，7个小时也足够了。
Shandong to Wuhan, in peacetime, only need more than an hour by air, even if it is a train, 7 hours is enough.
但2月1日，我决定到武汉做志愿者的时候，整个湖北都封城了，拉着三个行李箱、两个背包，我坐火车、坐滴滴、坐三轮甚至还走路步行，绕行兖州、洛阳、信阳、武胜，辗转多地，2月4日，终于成功到达武汉。
But on Feb. 1, when I decided to volunteer in Wuhan, the whole city of Hubei was closed, pulling three suitcases and two backpacks. I took the train, sat dripping, sat three wheels and even walked around Yanzhou, Luoyang, Xinyang and Wusheng.
您问我为什么非得去武汉？我觉得我能帮上忙。
You asked me why I had to go to Wuhan? I think I can help.
我是军人出身，转业后曾经在北京蓝天救援队工作，救助经验丰富，现在在北京做律师。
I am a serviceman, after a career in Beijing blue sky rescue team, experienced rescue, now in Beijing as a lawyer.
2008年汶川大地震时，我以志愿者的身份和几个朋友一起去了灾区，在四川省绵阳市北川县陈家坝镇和宁夏的消防总队并肩战斗。
In 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, I took a volunteer status with a few friends to the disaster area, in Mianyang City, Sichuan Province, Chen Jiaba Town and the Ningxia Fire Brigade fighting side by side.
我有急救护理经验，还曾在北师大读心理学硕士，做过心理咨询。
I have the experience of first aid nursing, and I also attended the Master of Psychology in Beijing Normal University.
因此，在疫情变得越来越严重后，我觉得来疫区能发挥我的价值。
So, as the epidemic gets worse and worse, I think it's going to be worth it.
瞒着家人，我悄悄联系了华中科技大学附属同济医院和武汉大学中南医院，他们急缺护理人员及心理咨询师，答应接收我作为志愿者。
Hidden from my family, I contacted Tongji Hospital, affiliated with Huazhong University of Science and Technology, and Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University.
一天接上百个求助电话从信阳跨过省界线到湖北的时候，警察对我说：“你想好啦？现在回头还来得及，还可以回去，进了你可能就出不来了。
A hundred calls a day from Xinyang across the provincial border to Hubei, the police said to me: "You think so? Now there is time to go back, can go back, you may not get out.
”我笑着回他：“会出来的，只是会晚点。
"I returned with a smile ．" It will come out ， only later ． "
”我的三个箱子装的是一个月的存粮和半行李箱药品，得知我要去武汉，我还有朋友给我买了保险。
My three suitcases contained a month's worth of food and half-luggage with medicine, and when I learned that I was going to Wuhan, I had friends who insured me.
所以，就算是爬，我也得爬到武汉。
So, even if I crawl, I have to climb to Wuhan.
但真正到了武汉，情况有了变化——武汉出了一个新规定，医院不能单独接收个人医护志愿者，只能市卫健委统一安排。
But in Wuhan, the situation has changed - Wuhan issued a new rule, the hospital can not accept individual medical volunteers, can only be unified arrangements Wei Wei Commission.
虽然我的名字报上去了，但迟迟得不到批复。
Although my name is in the newspaper, it is too late to get a reply.
护理工作做不成了，但也不能闲着呀。
Nursing can't be done, but you can't be idle.
当地志愿者给我找了一个小酒店，有了落脚的地方，我把我的电话号码公布在网络上，我的朋友也帮我不断推广，通过电话，我开始做一些心理咨询和辅导。
Local volunteers found me a small hotel, a place to stay, I posted my phone number on the Internet, my friends also help me to promote, through the telephone, I began to do some psychological counseling and counseling.
一开始主要接听的都是朋友的朋友，慢慢地，来电话的人变得不熟悉了，电话也越来越多，最高峰的时候，一天能有上百个电话，每天早晨6点起床到晚上睡觉，我的两部手机一直不停，忙得连饭都来不及吃，而接收的大部分都是负面情绪，那段时间，我的耳朵常常因为接听电话时间过长变得难受——其实电话咨询在哪儿都能做，但我人在武汉，对于武汉的朋友来说，可能会对我更加信任。
At the height of the day, there are hundreds of phone calls a day, and I get up at 6am to go to bed at night. My two cell phones are so busy that I can't even eat them.
找我的人里，有因为害怕这个未知病毒的，有对于不熟悉的处境感到担忧的，大多数人则是来求助的，我常常一个电话打半个小时，通过医生朋友，我了解到发热者想做核酸检测应该要走怎样的流程、去哪些医院能检测等，我也把这些信息告诉找我帮忙的朋友，甚至尽己所能帮他们联系到医院。
Most of the people who came to me were afraid of the unknown virus, worried about their unfamiliar situation. Most of them came to help. I often spent half an hour on the phone.
做电话心理咨询大概一周后，我发现一个问题。
About a week after doing telephone counseling, I found a problem.
跟我求助的人里，主要是大学教授、高级白领、私企老板等等，换句话说，我的服务对象里大部分都是社会中产阶级以上，他们手里的资源相对较多，但更需要帮助的中低收入者却很少联系我。
The people I turned to for help were university professors, senior white-collar workers, private-sector bosses, and so on. In other words, most of my clients were above the middle class, who had relatively more resources, but the lower and middle-income people who needed help rarely contacted me.
我想到，这群失声的人，他们可能连手机都不会用，没办法给我打电话，不会抢购口罩，甚至连温饱都解决不了，他们才是我来武汉的目的。
I think of this group of voiceless people, they may not even use the mobile phone, can not call me, do not rush to buy masks, even can not solve the problem of food and clothing, they are the reason I came to Wuhan.
我在武汉有几个朋友，他们在社区值班，我就通过他们深入社区，还有很多朋友通过微信给我转钱，我拿着这些钱在当地购买医护物资，包括口罩、酒精、84消毒液等防护用品，体温计、药品、营养品等，再送到非常紧缺物资的患者、社区工作人员以及医护人员那里。
I have a few friends in Wuhan who are on duty in the community, through whom I travel deep into the community, and I have many friends who transfer money to me through micro-letters, with which I buy medical supplies, including masks, alcohol, 84 disinfectants, thermometers, medicines, nutrients, and so on, to patients, community workers, and medical workers who are in great need.
我采买的部分物资当时，我每天跑几个药店，自己采购、分拣、配送分发等，口罩还是限购的，但药店知道我是买来捐赠的，就会让我多买些，到货也会给我预留。
Some of the things I bought back then, I went to a few pharmacies every day and did my own shopping, sorting, distribution, etc., and the masks were still restricted, but the drugstore knew I was buying them, so they would let me buy more and save them for me.
近的地方，我就步行去送，远的地方会托快递小哥，后来志愿者给了我一辆电动车，我就骑电动车送。
Nearby, I walked to deliver, distant places will be entrusted to express brother, and then volunteers gave me an electric car, I rode an electric car.
戴着蓝防护帽、白口罩，穿着蓝外套、黑裤子，再在脚踝处套个塑料袋，这就是我的防护措施了。
Wear a blue cap, a white mask, a blue coat, black pants, and a plastic bag around my ankle.
这期间，我还给需要的人做心理疏导，很忙很累，但很充实。
During this period, I also need people to do psychological counseling, very busy and tired, but very substantial.
方舱医院里的“祥林嫂”2月19日，我随新疆兵团医疗队进驻武汉客厅方舱医院，跟随心理医生张桂青，为确诊患者做心理疏导。
"Sister Xiang Lin" in the cabin hospital February 19, I entered the living room of Wuhan with the Xinjiang Military Corps Medical Team, followed the psychiatrist Zhang Gui-qing, to do psychological counseling for the confirmed patients.
在方舱医院，我第一次穿上正式的防护服，是一种窒息憋气的感觉，医护人员真的很不容易。
The first time I wore a formal suit at the Fang Cavern Hospital, it was suffocating, and it was really not easy for the paramedics.
到的第一天，有人知道心理医生来了，就有患者找到我说，你赶紧去看看一个老太太。
To the first day, someone knew that the psychiatrist came, patients came to me, you hastened to see an old lady.
原来，这个老太太进了方舱医院以后，每天都在打电话哭诉，她的老伴因为新冠肺炎已经去世了，她情绪很不好。
It turned out that the old lady into the cabin hospital, every day after the call to cry, her old wife has died of pneumonia, she was in a bad mood.
说实话，这些经历旁边的病友听第一遍的时候，觉得她很可怜，很同情，但要是天天听，加上老太太嗓门也大，也受不了，而且方舱医院的病房很大，周围的病友也被带的情绪不好了，大家都有些沮丧。
To tell the truth, the patient next to the experience felt sorry and sorry for her for the first time, but it was a little depressing to listen every day and add to the old lady's voice, and because the cabin hospital ward was large and the sick people around her were in a bad mood.
所以我到她床边了以后，就握着她的手，跟她聊了很长时间。
So when I got to her bed, I took her hand and talked to her for a long time.
其实心理咨询大多数时候也是在倾听，他们需要倾诉，最后我再给她一些建议，告诉她我能为她做些什么。
In fact, most of the time counseling is listening, they need to talk, and finally I give her some advice about what I can do for her.
我告诉她，她必须要好好照顾自己，康复了才能做自己想做的事，以后有什么事，就写下来，她慢慢也就平静了下来。
I told her that she had to take good care of herself and get well before she could do what she wanted to do.
在方舱医院里，我发现自己很受欢迎。
In the cabin hospital, I found myself very popular.
或许是因为这个病目前没什么特效药，医护人员没啥办法，但我做心理疏导，往往一交流就是个把小时。
Perhaps because this disease does not have the special medicine at present, the medical staff has no way, but I do psychological counseling, often a communication is an hour.
聊着聊着，大家就处成了朋友。
As we chatted, they became friends.
我和方舱医院的患者后来，方舱医院渐入正轨，我就到了武汉商职医院。
I and the patients of the cabin hospital later, the square cabin hospital gradually into the right way, I went to Wuhan commercial hospital.
相对于金银潭、协和、同济这些大医院，商职医院是一家二级医院，很多运到武汉的物资都送不到这里——就我的观察来看，其实武汉现在并不缺物资，但是在分配上存在一些问题，比如很多定点医院，知名度高的医院，政府的分配上会优先照顾，还能接收社会的定点捐赠，但商职医院这样的医院，知名度低，我们进病房，连套像样的防护服都没有。
As far as my observations are concerned, Wuhan is not short of supplies, but there are some problems in distribution, such as many designated hospitals, high-profile hospitals, government priority in distribution and receiving targeted donations from the community.
于是，我开始给商职医院的医生护士找防护物资，我还把这一情况反馈到了指挥部。
So I started looking for protective equipment for the doctors and nurses at the commercial hospital, and I reported it back to the headquarters.
没想到，指挥部要求整改的要求下达到区以后，医院院长还埋怨我多事，但基层的医护人员给我发消息：毛老师，我们都支持你。
Unexpectedly, the command of the request for rectification under the district, hospital director also complained about my many things, but the grass-roots health-care staff sent me a message: Mr. Mao, we all support you.
我觉得我还挺开心。
I think I'm having a good time.
这两天，我给医院搞了点鲜牛奶，医护人员需要营养，病人也需要。
Over the past two days, I've got some fresh milk for the hospital. The paramedics need nourishment and the patients need it.
我和商职医院的患者社区工作人员在我面前崩溃很多时候，我在社区帮忙。
I collapsed in front of me and the patient community at the business hospital and I helped out in the community a lot of times.
有一起工作过的社区干部也被病毒感染了，我想去医院看他，他死活不让我去，怕我被传染，风险太大。
I want to see him in the hospital. He won't let me go, for fear that I will be infected.
你看，疫情面前，就是这样，有些人让你恼火，有些人让你流泪。
You see, the epidemic, this is the case, some people make you angry, some people make you cry.
记得2月10日，时任武汉市委书记的马国强说，截止到2月9日，武汉户数排查的百分比已达到98.6%，人数排查百分比达到99%，并争取在2月11日完成所有疑似患者的检测清零。
As of February 9, the percentage of households surveyed in Wuhan had reached 98.6 percent, and the number of people screened had reached 99 percent, with the goal of having all suspected patients tested zero by February 11, said Ma Guoqiang, then secretary of Wuhan Municipal Party Committee.
这个数据很快遭到了网友的质疑。
The data was quickly challenged by netizens.
身在一线的我，自然更加了解这一数据的荒谬。
Being on the line, I naturally know more about the absurdity of this data.
当时，我在武汉水果湖街道支援工作，但当时该街道仍有180余名确诊患者得不到收治，其中有一部分还是危重症患者，他们被迫与健康的居民居住于同一小区，增加了病毒传染的风险。
At the time, I was working in the streets of Shuiguo Lake in Wuhan, but there were still more than 180 confirmed patients in the street, some of whom were critically ill and forced to live in the same neighbourhood as healthy residents, increasing the risk of transmission of the virus.
在武汉，像水果湖街道这样的基层社区还有100来个，保守估计还有10000多未收治的病人。
In Wuhan, there are still about 100 grass-roots communities, such as the Shuiguohu street, with a conservative estimate of more than 10,000 untreated patients.
我把我收集的这些情况写成了一个报告，建议社区要进行拉网式的排查，把病人都找出来，这份报告被辗转递给了上面，据说上面很快就批示了。
I drew up a report from my collection, suggesting that the community should conduct a scanner to find all the patients. The report was handed over to me and it was said that it had been approved very quickly.
过了几天，2月13日，湖北省、武汉市双双换帅，这一天，武汉市新增了13436个确诊患者，是前几天的六七倍。
After a few days, February 13, Hubei Province, Wuhan city Shuangshuai, this day, Wuhan City added 13,436 confirmed patients, six or seven times the previous days.
我不敢说这份报告在其中起到了多大作用，毕竟领导们有很多消息渠道。
I can't say how much of a role the report played. After all, the leaders had a lot of sources.
但13436这个数字出来以后，再走到武汉大街上，你能明显感到氛围要比以前轻松了很多。
But when the number 13436 comes out and you walk down Wuhan Street, you can clearly feel the atmosphere is a lot easier than before.
我帮助一些武汉流浪者找到了能够收容他们的酒店不过，由于武汉要求社区严格实行社区封闭管理，这两天找我的人又变多了。
I have helped some Wuhan vagrants find hotels that can accommodate them, but the demand for strict community management in Wuhan has led to more people turning to me over the past two days.
前阵子，一个保安出现了比较严重的精神问题，我过去处理了之后，他情绪暂时稳定下来，但我还是希望他的父亲能尽快赶来照顾他，因为现在他的情况，需要一个既亲近又有威严的人在身边，才能管住他。
Some time ago, a security guard had a serious mental problem, and after I had dealt with it, his mood stabilized for the time being, but I still hoped that his father would come and take care of him as soon as possible, for his condition required the presence of a close and dignified person to keep him in check.
由于干预及时，这个小伙子如今已经恢复了正常。
As a result of the timely intervention, the young man is now back to normal.
当天，处理完这个案子以后，我去社区的办公室坐了坐。
That day, after handling the case, I went to the community office and sat down.
社区的小姑娘跟我聊着聊着就哭了，她年纪不大，非常时期的氛围让她崩溃，我默默地听她说话，尽我所知给了她一些建议。
The little girl in the community cried as she chatted with me. She wasn't old enough to be upset by the atmosphere. I listened to her silently and gave her as much advice as I knew.
那天回到家，已经晚上11点了。
Back home that day, it was 11 pm.
我也曾两次崩溃，还想做女儿的超级英雄疫情发生的一个多月，太多人情绪绷不住。
I also had two crashes and wanted to be my daughter's superhero for more than a month, and too many people were stressed out.
甚至我也遭遇过情绪的崩溃。
Even I have experienced emotional breakdown.
有一次我刷视频看到一个小女孩被隔离了，心里特别难受，因为我也有一个8岁的女儿，一下子感同身受。
When I brushed the video and saw a little girl isolated, it was especially hard because I, too, had an 8-year-old daughter who felt the same way.
最近，我想起我碰到的一些不愿意担事的领导，还有一些说风凉话的人，我也问过自己，这么跨越1000多公里，经历重重困难跑到武汉，是为了什么？我现在住在朋友的民宿顶层，买不到菜买不到水果（因为超市不对个人出售），要是去医院去社区能吃顿工作餐，但早上晚上往往就是一顿泡面了事，真的有意义吗？最难受的时候，我把我的这些疑问发到了朋友圈，很多朋友安慰我。
Recently, I thought of the leaders I met who didn't want to do something, and some who spoke sarcastic words, and I have asked myself why I came to Wuhan after so many difficulties over 1000 kilometers, I now live on the top floor of a friend's house.
我想：嗨，毛平，你来干吗来了你，你不就是志愿者，自愿要来做事的吗？做事不是要得到表扬。
I thought: Hey, Mao Ping, why did you come here? You are a volunteer? Do not do things to be praised.
孩子的妈妈看到了朋友圈，也跟我说，我只要对得起我自己就好。
The child's mother saw the circle of friends, also told me, I just worthy of my own good.
其实，1月初的时候我来武汉出过差，在武汉呆了两天。
In fact, in early January I came to Wuhan on a business trip, spent two days in Wuhan.
回到北京以后，我的状态不太好，但还是频繁出差，去了广州、郑州、济南等等，后来就发了高烧，浑身无力。
Back in Beijing, I was not in good shape, but I went to Guangzhou, Zhengzhou, Jinan and so on on frequent business trips.
平时我的身体不错，当时生病的感觉是这么多年没有过的。
Usually I am in good health, when the feeling of illness is so many years have not been.
高烧、头疼、咳嗽、胸痛......我对照着网上新冠肺炎的症状，觉得自己简直完全一样。
I had a high fever, a headache, a cough, chest pain... I felt exactly the same against the symptoms of pneumonia on the Internet.
我联系了那些天出差遇到过的所有朋友，告诉他们我的情况，希望他们暂时先自我隔离。
I contacted all the friends I had met on business these days, told them about me, and wanted them to isolate themselves for the time being.
后来，我的病情一度恶化，我甚至有个念头：我的生命是不是就走到这儿了？不过，到了腊月二十九，我的身体慢慢恢复了。
Later, when my condition deteriorated, I even had the idea that my life was here. However, by the 29th of December, my body was slowly recovering.
到现在，我依然不能确定我得的是不是新冠肺炎，幸运的是，当时跟我接触过的人，没有一例感染的。
So far, I'm still unsure if I have a new crown pneumonia. Fortunately, none of the people I came into contact with were infected.
但年前的这场病，让我坚定到武汉的心，另一个原因是，我还想用行动告诉女儿，什么是更有意义的事。
But the disease of the past year, let me firmly to Wuhan heart, another reason is, I also want to tell my daughter by action, what is more meaningful.
北京红丹丹基金会郑大姐和朋友们支援的物资来之前，我朋友给我买了上百万保额的保险，我跟孩子妈妈说：万一，假设的事发生了，告诉孩子，这样的人做她父亲，不丢脸吧？孩子妈妈对我有些无语，但最后她宽慰我：爱你所爱，行你所行，听从你心，无问西东。
My friend insured me for a million dollars before the Red Dandan Foundation in Beijing came along, and I told my mother: In case something should happen, tell the child that such a person would be her father.
早春的武汉春风拂面，这两天接到爸妈打来的电话，询问我的近况。
Wuhan spring wind blowing in early spring, these two days received a phone call from my parents, asking me how I was doing.
我告诉他们我过得好着呢：吃着大餐、住着五星级的酒店。
