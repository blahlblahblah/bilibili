澎湃新闻记者 汤琪 发自武汉武汉一所市属高校，近日卷入了一场舆论风波。
Tangqi, a Peng Pai journalist, came from a municipal university in Wuhan, Wuhan, and recently became embroiled in a public uproar.
2月7日中午11时许，位于武汉市东湖高新区的武汉软件工程职业学院接到紧急通知，学校需腾出1000间学生宿舍，作为新型冠状肺炎病毒（以下简称“新冠肺炎”）密切接触者的隔离点。
On February 7, at about 11: 00 noon, Wuhan Software Engineering Vocational College, located in the Donghu High-tech District of Wuhan, was urgently required to vacate 1,000 student dormitories to serve as a quarantine point for close contacts of the new coronary pneumonia virus (hereafter referred to as "New Crown Pneumonia").
当天，学校内部便向学生发布《告学子书》，告知需被征用的宿舍楼编号，并承诺，学生的个人物品将被妥善管理。
On the same day, the School issued a "Letter to Students" informing them of the number of the dormitory to be requisitioned and promising that the students' personal belongings would be properly managed.
为防控疫情，各地高校延迟开学时间。
To prevent and control the epidemic, colleges and universities across the delay.
由于仍处于假期，学校接到任务后紧急召回200余名教职工，投入到清空宿舍的工作中。
Still on vacation, the school was asked to recall more than 200 faculty members and put them to work in empty dormitories.
计划赶不上变化。
Plans cannot keep pace with change.
第二天，2月8日，学校再接通知，还要再腾出1000间宿舍。
The next day, Feb. 8, the school was notified of the need to vacate another 1,000 dormitories.
在繁复的清理工作压力下，这一次，学校未能及时通知到学生。
Under the pressure of the complex cleaning work, this time the school failed to notify the students in time.

本文图均为澎湃新闻记者 汤琪 图2月9日，该校有学生在宿舍群里看到一些照片，宿舍楼天井下的空地上被扔满了各种物品，还有人正在翻学生柜子里的物品，丢在地上。
Students in the dorm cluster saw pictures of objects littering the vacant lot under the patio, and others rummaging through the contents of the students' cupboards, throwing them on the floor.
一时间，各种视频和照片开始在网上疯传，矛头指向校方，认为学校“野蛮清空学生宿舍”，引发网友不满。
For a while, videos and photos began to circulate wildly on the Internet, pointing at the school, saying the school "brutally empty student hostels," triggered netizens dissatisfaction.
孙美华感到非常无奈。
Sun Mei-hua felt very helpless.
作为武汉软件工程职业学院副校长，接到任务后，她已经连续几天没有回家，全身心投入到宿舍清空、物资搬运的工作。
As the vice-president of Wuhan Software Engineering Vocational College, she has not returned home for several days and devoted herself to the work of clearing and moving materials.
“事情的真相真的不是你们在网上看到的那样。
"The truth is not exactly what you see on the Internet.
”2月10日，在接受澎湃新闻（www.thepaper.cn）采访时，她一度有些哽咽，说不出话来。
In an interview with the roaring news (www.thepper.cn) on February 10, she was briefly choked and speechless.
“清空行动”武汉软件工程职业学院并非被征用为隔离点的唯一高校。
Wuhan Software Engineering Vocational College is not the only university that has been requisitioned as a separation point.
2月7日晚，湖北省召开新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情防控工作例行新闻发布会。
February 7 evening, Hubei Province held a new coronavirus infection of the pneumonia epidemic routine press conference.
武汉市委常委、常务副市长胡亚波表示，省、市防疫指挥部正在将省委党校、武汉市属高校改造成病房，预计增加5400个床位，用于收治轻症患者。
Wuhan Municipal Committee Standing Committee and Deputy Mayor Hu Yapo said the provincial and municipal epidemic prevention commands are transforming provincial Party schools and Wuhan municipal colleges into wards, adding 5,400 beds for treating patients with mild illnesses.
武汉市共有四所市属高校，包括江汉大学、武汉商学院、武汉船舶职业技术学院和武汉软件工程职业学院，已全部接到征用宿舍的通知。
Four municipal universities in Wuhan city, including Jianghan University, Wuhan Business School, Wuhan Shipping Vocational and Technical College and Wuhan Software Engineering Vocational College, have all been notified of the requisition of dormitory.
但已有学校表示，目前高校宿舍仅作为疑似和发热病人的隔离点，是否进一步作为确诊轻症患者的隔离病房还要视疫情发展而定。
But some schools say the dormitories are only used as quarantine points for suspected and febrile patients, and whether they can be used as isolation wards for patients with mild cases will depend on the development of the epidemic.
武汉软件工程职业学院是2月7日上述11时许接到的通知，因为疫情缘故，高校至今仍未开学，原本应该熙熙攘攘的校园格外安静。
Wuhan Software Engineering Vocational College was informed at about 11: 00 a.m. on February 7, because the university has not yet opened because of the epidemic, should be bustling campus exceptionally quiet.
接到通知以后，校方紧急召回200余名教职工投入到清空学生宿舍、搬运物资等工作中。
After receiving the notice, the university recalled more than 200 staff and workers to empty the dormitory, carry materials and other work.
2月7日，学校内部向学生发布《告学子书》，告知学生，该校12、13、14、15、16栋共1000间宿舍被征用。
On 7 February, the School issued a "Letter to Students" informing them that 1,000 dormitories, comprising 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16, had been requisitioned.
“同学们，请你们放心，宿舍都是老师们亲手收拾整理，你们的个人物品已被妥善保管……宿舍将由专业人员严格管理，使用完毕后会进行专业的清洁消毒，确保安全无虞。
"Students, please rest assured that the dormitory is the teachers hand-tidy, your personal belongings have been carefully managed... The dormitory will be strictly managed by professional staff, after the use of professional cleaning and disinfection, to ensure safety and security.
”《告学子书》写道。
"The Telling the Schoolchildren" wrote.
第二天，2月8日，学校再接通知，要再增加1000间宿舍作为隔离点。
The next day, Feb. 8, the school was told to add another 1,000 dormitories as quarantine points.
这一次，校方未再向学生发布通告，教职工的工作量陡增。
This time, the university has not issued a notice to the students, the workload of the staff increased sharply.
情急之下，一些看上去有些粗糙的清理行为经网络发酵，让这所高校陷入舆论风波。
In a hurry, some seemingly crude clean-up activities ferment over the internet, sending the university into a storm of public opinion.
宿舍楼内已经整理干净，此前网上的图片显示，这里曾堆满垃圾。
The bungalow has been cleaned up after pictures posted on the Internet showed it had been filled with rubbish.
2月9日，网络上流传出该校清理宿舍的照片和视频。

有视频还显示，一些工作人员正在翻学生柜子里的物品，然后随意丢在地上。
Video also showed some staff members rummaging through items in their lockers before dropping them on the floor at random.
更有学生反映，自己并未接到学校通知，认为自己的私人物品未得到应有的尊重。
More students reported that they had not been notified by the school that their personal belongings were not treated with due respect.
一时间，各种视频和照片开始在网上疯传，矛头指向校方，引发网友不满。
For a while, various videos and photos began to spread frantically on the Internet, pointing at the school, causing dissatisfaction among netizens.
2月10日凌晨1时许，武汉软件工程职业学院团委的官方微博就此事件发布了一则致歉信，信中写道，“在整理过程中确实出现个别人员为赶进度，整理不细致、处置不当的情况。
At about 1 a.m. on February 10, the official microblog of the Wuhan Software Engineering Vocational College issued a letter apologizing for the incident, in which he said, "There have indeed been cases in which individuals have made indiscreet and inappropriate efforts to catch up with the schedule.
在此，学校深表歉意，同时郑重承诺，所有同学物品若有损失，开学后学校将在核实的基础上予以赔偿（补偿）。
At this point, the school apologizes and solemnly undertakes to compensate (compensate) all students for the loss of their belongings on a verified basis after the start of school.
”副校长的委屈和教职工的付出武汉软件工程职业学院副校长孙美华2月9日下午了解到舆情时，感到心力憔悴。
"Vice-president of the grievance and pay staff Wuhan software engineering professional college Vice-President Sun Mei-hua learned February 9 when the public opinion, feel haggard.
接到改造隔离点的任务后，她已经连续几天没有回家，全身心投入到宿舍清空、物资搬运的工作中，有时半夜两三点还在宿舍楼坚守，对接物资。
She had not returned home for several days after receiving the task of upgrading the quarantine site, so she threw herself into the work of clearing the dormitory and moving supplies, sometimes holding out in the dormitory at two or three in the middle of the night.
“我们前期确实没有和学生进行详尽的沟通，实在没有时间。
"We really didn't have a thorough communication with the students in the early days. We really didn't have time.
”2月10日下午，孙美华接受澎湃新闻采访时表示，当天上午，老师们已经一对一打电话给宿舍被征用的学生，并说明了情况。
In an interview with reporters Monday afternoon, Sun said teachers had called one-on-one the students in the dormitory that morning to explain the situation.
“希望他们相信老师，学生们的贵重物品、有情感记忆的物品都会为他们安置好。
"I hope they trust their teachers, their students' valuables, their emotional memories," he said.
”在被征用前，该校的学生宿舍几乎满员。
Before the expropriation, the school's dormitories were almost full.
据孙美华介绍，他们在清理工作前已将所有的学生物品分为三类：一类是日常用品，比如被褥、洗漱用品等，都用被子卷好放好；另一类是贵重物品，比如电脑，老师们都进行了登记，集中放置在指定宿舍锁好；最后一类是有纪念价值的物品，比如获奖证书、明信片等，校方要求老师们尽量关注到，并妥善保管。
Before the cleanup, Sun said, they had divided all the items into three groups: items such as bedding and toiletries, which were rolled up and stored; valuables such as computers, which were registered by teachers and placed in locked rooms; and items of commemorative value, such as certificates and postcards.
校方提供的学生物品归类说明根据校方提供的多份归类说明文档，澎湃新闻注意到，被征用的宿舍楼内，每层都会选取一部分房间作为仓库，专门用于放置其他被清空宿舍的学生物品，并标记清相对应的宿舍编号。
On the basis of a number of classification documents provided by the university, Pai Pai News noticed that in the requisitioned dormitory building, some rooms were selected as warehouses on each floor for the purpose of placing other students' articles in empty dormitories and marking the corresponding dormitory numbers.
“我们的学校没有生活区，前来支援的200多名教职工分散居住在武汉三镇，有的人想来帮忙，但因为没有车不方便。
"Our school has no living quarters and the more than 200 staff who come to support us live scattered throughout Wuhan three towns. Some people want to help, but it is inconvenient because there is no car.
”孙美华坦言，由于学校的女性职工居多，清理宿舍、搬运物资又都是力气活，好多老师都是克服重重困难而来，只为尽快把宿舍清空交付。
Sun said many teachers were working hard to clear the dormitory as quickly as possible because the school had so many female staff, cleaning up dormitories and carrying materials.
2月10日下午，澎湃新闻实地探访武汉软件工程职业学院被征用的宿舍楼，此前网上流传的照片中堆满垃圾的宿舍楼大厅已经清理干净。
February 10 afternoon, Peng Pai news field visit Wuhan Institute of Software Engineering Vocational College requisitioned dormitory building, before the online photos of a garbage-filled dormitory hall has been cleaned up.
在一间间宿舍内，校方为即将入住的隔离人员准备了脸盆、毛巾、卫生纸等生活用品，一些学生的拖鞋、被褥等物品都塞进他们的柜子里，等待封存。
In one room, the school prepared washbasins, towels, toilet paper and other items for the incoming occupants, and some students' slippers, bedding and other items were stuffed into their cabinets, waiting to be sealed off.
学校为即将入住隔离点的人员提供生活物品参与清理工作的武汉软件工程职业学院机械工程学院院长王忠林告诉澎湃新闻，网上一些照片看上去像是学生的物品被当成垃圾扔在地上，但实际上是在清理过程中，确实有许多废纸盒、空瓶子等是学生还来不及扔掉的垃圾，有用的物品是绝对不会乱扔。
Wang Zhonglin, dean of Wuhan Institute of Software Engineering, the Wuhan Vocational College of Software Engineering, which is helping to clean up the mess, told the roaring news that some of the pictures on the Internet looked like students' belongings were being dumped as trash, but in fact, during the cleaning process, there were many waste cartons, empty bottles and so on.
王忠林承认，因为宿舍楼有六层之高，没有电梯，为了和时间赛跑，在保证楼下无人的情况下，确实存在把成袋的垃圾从楼上直接扔下的情况，导致照片中的观感不佳，但事后已经全部清理，这其中绝不会有学生的贵重用品。
Wang admitted that because there were six floors high, there was no elevator, and in order to race against time and make sure no one else was downstairs, bags of garbage were dropped directly from the building, resulting in a poor view, but it was all cleaned up afterwards and there would never have been any valuable supplies for the students.
“我们把能找来的人都找来帮忙了，其中还有50多岁的老教授，他们都趴在地上把学生床下的垃圾清理出来，把厕所反复用拖把拖干净。
"We got help from people we could find, including our 50-year-old professors, who sprawled the rubbish out of their beds and mooped7 the toilets.
”王忠林直言，网上偏激的言论让老师们感到有些寒心。
"Wang Zhonglin bluntly said that the extreme comments on the Internet made teachers feel a little chilled.
“事情的真相真的不完全是网上看到的那样，疫情过后，我们依然要面对的是我们的学生，学校能够不爱自己的学生吗？”孙美华在接受采访时一度哽咽，双眼里的血丝和泪水都清晰可见。
"The truth is not exactly what we saw on the Internet, after the epidemic, we still have to face our students, the school can not love their own students?" Sun Mei-hua in the interview, the blood in the eyes and tears are clearly visible.
静待隔离人员入住尽管有委屈，但2月10日凌晨1时许，武汉软件工程职业学院团委官方微博还是主动就此事件发布了一则致歉信。
Waiting for Quarantine Despite the grievances, the official Weibo of Wuhan Software Engineering Vocational College issued a letter of apology on February 10 at about 1: 00 a.m.
信中写道，“在整理过程中确实出现个别人员为赶进度，整理不细致、处置不当的情况。
"In the process of finishing, there were cases where individuals were not meticulous and handled inappropriately in order to meet the schedule," the letter wrote.
在此，学校深表歉意，同时郑重承诺，所有同学物品若有损失，开学后学校将在核实的基础上予以赔偿（补偿）。
At this point, the school apologizes and solemnly undertakes to compensate (compensate) all students for the loss of their belongings on a verified basis after the start of school.
”这场风波在不少武汉人的微信群里疯传，诸如“学子们注意，不要报考这所学校”的言论也影响到了在该校工作人员刘静（化名）的心情。
"The uproar has spread through the crowd of Wuhan people, with comments such as" students, don't sign up for the school "affecting the mood of Liu Jing, a staff member.
这两天，她收到不少学生发来的信息，他们都出于关心，向学校老师表示了安慰。
Over the past two days she had received many messages from students, all of whom had expressed their comfort to the school teachers out of concern.
2月10日下午，刘静看到工作群里有老师还在发他们翻垃圾的视频。
On the afternoon of February 10, Liu Jing saw a teacher in the work group still distributing videos of them rummaging through the garbage.
她告诉澎湃新闻，老师们还想看看有没有不小心扔掉的有用物品，但翻来翻去，全都是垃圾。
She told the roar news that the teachers wanted to see if anything useful had been thrown away, but it was all rubbish.
也有学校老师在微博上发布了他们清理学生宿舍的经过——能整理到柜子里的物品就绝不放外面，能放外面的也用盒子一个个打包，就连一些未使用的一次性筷子都没有扔，连一幅张贴在柜子上的易烊千玺的海报，老师都小心撕下来，卷起后放到了柜子里。
Other school teachers posted stories on microblogs about cleaning their dormitories -- things that could be packed in cabinets would never be left outside, boxes would be placed outside, even unused disposable chopsticks had not been thrown, and a poster of the Seal, which had been posted on the cupboard, had been carefully torn off, rolled up and placed in the cupboard.
一部分的学生物品被塞进柜子里，等待封存。
Some of the students' belongings were stuffed into cabinets, waiting to be sealed.
“灾情来临的时候，每个人的反应都不同，有时候温暖人的，都是那些不计较的付出。
"When disaster strikes, everyone's reaction is different, sometimes warm people, are those who do not care about the pay.
”刘静感慨，老师们的付出都问心无愧，他们不顾安危连续奋战好几个昼夜，才应是焦点。
"Liu Jing sigh, teachers pay a clear conscience, they disregard the safety and security of the continuous struggle for days and nights, should be the focus.
如今，用以征用的宿舍楼回归了平静，等待着即将入住的隔离人员。
Today, the dormitory building used for the expropriation has returned to calm, waiting for the quarantined people to be moved in.
那时，宿舍也将交给专业人士管理。
At that time, the hostel will also be handed over to professionals.
同样是清空宿舍，为何武汉软件工程职业学院成为众矢之的？“可能是我们把孩子们不要的废纸盒子等垃圾都清出来了吧，要是我们不管这些，也是可以的，但那是对学生的不负责任。
Why is Wuhan Software Engineering Vocational College the target of criticism We may have cleaned out all the rubbish that children don't want, but it would be OK if we didn't care, but it would be irresponsible for students
”王忠林再复盘这一切时，如是说道。
"said Wang Zhonglin, as he resumed the table.
