疫情期间，焦虑是他们的普遍情绪“焦虑”是整个春节都萦绕在钱琳（化名）心头的情绪。
During the outbreak, anxiety was their general mood "anxiety" that haunted Changlin throughout the Spring Festival.
钱琳的母亲是一名肺癌患者，疫情之前，就在去年12月才刚刚带母亲做了复查，医生给出的结果是，“病情控制的很好，建议继续吃药”。
Her mother, a lung cancer patient, had just been reexamined by her mother in December, and the doctor said, "The condition is well under control and we recommend continuing to take it."
不出意外，母亲依靠肺癌靶向药，可以像过去五年一样继续稳定的带癌生活。
Unsurprisingly, mothers can continue to live with cancer as steadily as they have for the past five years, relying on targeted drugs for lung cancer.
但突如其来的疫情打乱了这一计划。
But the sudden outbreak upset the plan.
2月4日，母亲的肺癌靶向药物只够坚持三天了，但随着新冠肺炎确诊病例不断增加，越来越多医院被征用，资源向新冠肺炎患者倾斜，“出门去医院买药”变得异常艰难。
On February 4, the mother was able to target only three days of lung cancer, but "going out to the hospital to buy medicine" became extremely difficult as confirmed cases of pneumonia continued to increase, more hospitals were requisitioned, resources tilted to patients with pneumonia.
钱琳担心，如果不能按时吃药，母亲病情再一次复发了怎么办。
Changlin worried, if cannot take medicine on time, mother's condition relapse again how to do.
对于癌症患者来说，疫情期间，焦虑是他们的普遍情绪。
For cancer patients, anxiety is their general mood during the outbreak.
一方面面临着被感染的高危风险，另一方面，封城封路以及暂停常规医疗服务又使他们面临缺医断药、病情恶化的危险，满足癌症患者的医疗需求成为亟待解决的切实问题。
On the one hand, the high risk of infection and, on the other hand, the closure of roads and the suspension of routine medical services expose them to the risk of medical failure and deterioration, and meeting the medical needs of cancer patients has become an urgent and real problem.
而关于他们的救治，其实有人已经在行动。
And with regard to their treatment, someone is already on the move.
每场1000多人的线上问答疫情期间，宋启斌变得更加忙碌。
With more than 1000 people per session online quizzing during the epidemic, Song Qinbin became even busier.
用他的话说，以前下班回家可以歇着，现在下班就拿起手机，回复患者消息。
In his words, he used to come home from work to rest, now pick up the phone after work, to reply to the patient's message.
宋启斌是武汉大学人民医院肿瘤中心主任，也是湖北省临床肿瘤学会理事长。
Song Qinbin is director of tumor center of Wuhan University People's Hospital and director of Hubei Clinical Oncology Society.
武汉作为此次新冠肺炎疫情的重点疫区，1月23日宣布封城后，很多医院门诊也随之停诊，这对于癌症患者来说，更是雪上加霜。
Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak of the new crown pneumonia, was closed on January 23 and many hospital clinics were closed, making matters worse for cancer patients.
1月28日，武汉市新冠肺炎防控指挥部医疗救治组下发通知，要求做好疫情期间特殊病人的医疗保障工作，其中专门提到了要满足慢性肾衰病人、孕产妇、外科疾病等人群的医疗保健服务需求。
On January 28, the medical treatment group of Wuhan Xinguan Pneumonia Control and Prevention Command issued a notice calling for medical care for special patients during the epidemic period, with special reference to the need to meet the needs of patients with chronic renal failure, maternal and surgical diseases.
但面对疫情蔓延，非危急重症患者也不建议在此时期来院就诊，线下诊疗不再忙碌，一些就诊活动转到了线上。
However, in the face of the spread of the epidemic, non-critically ill patients are not recommended to visit the hospital during this period, the off-line consultation is no longer busy, some clinic activities to the line.
宋启斌表示，考虑到肺癌不仅是第一大癌种，拥有最多的患病人群，也是此次新冠肺炎的易感人群，一旦合并感染很容易发展成重症。
Given that lung cancer is not only the number one cancer, with the largest number of people affected, it is also the most susceptible population to the new crown pneumonia, which can easily develop into serious illness if co-infection occurs, Song said.
于是，依托湖北省临床肿瘤学会肺癌诊疗一体化中心(integrated Lung Cancer Center，简称iLCC)平台，他联合了该平台上近150名专家，针对肺癌患者群体开启线上诊疗模式。
So, relying on the platform of the Integrated Lung Cancer Center (iLCC) of the Hubei Clinical Oncology Society, he teamed up with nearly 150 experts on the platform to open up online diagnostic models for groups of patients with lung cancer.
“他们非常需要帮助，但我们又不能到病人身边去，所以就做了很多尝试。
"They need a lot of help, but we can't get to the patients, so there are a lot of attempts.
”宋启斌说道。
"said Song.
根据不同患者的不同诉求，团队专家给出相应的医学建议。
According to the different demands of different patients, the team experts give the corresponding medical advice.
如对于一部分已经确认但未能及时入院的患者，错过治疗的最佳窗口期将变得更加危险；对于经过治疗需要定期随访复查的患者，则需要根据具体病情建议适度延期或者及时续药。
For some patients who have been identified but not hospitalized in time, the optimal window for missing treatment will become more dangerous; for patients requiring regular follow-up after treatment, a modest extension or timely renewal depending on the patient's condition will be recommended.
他还组织湖北省临床肿瘤学会的多位专家撰写了一份《疫情期间肿瘤患者居家生活方式的医学专家建议》，对患者在吃、补、运动等方面给出详细的医学建议。
He also organized a group of experts from the Hubei Clinical Oncology Society to write a "Medical Expert's Advice on the Home Lifestyle of Tumor Patients During the Epidemic Period," giving detailed medical advice on how to eat, fill and exercise.
同时还有《肿瘤免疫治疗》、《肿瘤抗血管治疗》和《乳腺癌诊疗》等，以期给疫情下的癌症患者专业指导。
At the same time, there are "tumor immunotherapy," "tumor anti-vascular treatment" and "breast cancer diagnosis and treatment," in order to provide professional guidance to cancer patients under the epidemic.
就像同样身处武汉的一家三甲医院急救中心医生的李春，他在抗疫一线工作时被确诊为新冠肺炎，为了不占用紧张的床位资源选择居家隔离，并在隔离期间坚持为发热病人提供网上问诊。
Like Li Chun, a doctor at the first aid center of a three-A hospital in Wuhan, who was diagnosed with pneumonia while working on the frontline to fight the disease, chose to stay at home to avoid straining bedspace resources, and insisted on providing online consultations for febrile patients during isolation.
他说，“为了保证看病质量，医院限制我们每天最多看50个人，我一上线就调整到200个。
"To ensure the quality of care, hospitals limit our attendance to up to 50 people a day, and I adjust it to 200 as soon as I go online," he said.
但没想到还超标了。
But I didn't expect it.
第二天，我调整到300个……现在把上限调整成多少，就会有多少患者。
The next day, I adjusted it to 300... and now that the ceiling is adjusted, there will be as many patients.
打开手机，源源不断的咨询请求，手机的运行速度根本跟不上。
With mobile phones on and endless requests for advice, they simply can't keep up.
”出于医生的责任感，他们希望通过借助在线问诊平台帮助到更多患者。
Out of a sense of responsibility, doctors hope to reach more patients with online consultation platforms.
“我们每场线上活动都有1000多人在网络平台上互动。
"We have more than 1,000 people interacting on every online event.
”宋启斌介绍，通过这种线上门诊的方式，患者与医生进行详细的病情交流，虽然不能面对面，“但也是我们能做的一些事情。
The online clinic allows detailed, though not face-to-face, communication between patients and their doctors, but it is also something we can do, Song said.
”50万人次的公益直播对癌症患者的救治，除了政府部门和医疗机构，不少企业也在积极参与，协助让越来越多的医生加入到线上义诊，用专业的知识协助患者解决诊疗难题。
In addition to government departments and medical institutions, many enterprises are also taking an active part in helping more and more doctors participate in on-line medical consultations, and use their professional knowledge to help patients solve medical problems.
觅健创始人刘文桂就带着这样的初心。
Liu Wengui, the founder of foraging for health, has this kind of initial heart.
觅健是癌症及重症患者互助交流社区及院外康复管理平台，也是肿瘤领域特别是肺癌领域最早的患者线上社区之一，平时患者多在平台上学习疾病知识，交流康复经验。
Physical fitness is a platform for mutual exchange of patients with cancer and serious diseases. It is also one of the earliest online communities in the field of cancer, especially lung cancer.
疫情发生后，刘文桂发现平台患者活跃度翻了一倍，讨论的内容方向多集中在“医生开诊什么情况”“现在我这里没有药了怎么办”“复查延期会不会有影响”……因为城市封锁、交通管制、资源紧张等种种原因，不少的患者及家属对于库存用药服完或治疗延迟后将面临的局面而忧心忡忡。
After the outbreak, Liu Wengui found that the level of activity of patients on the platform doubled, and much of the discussion focused on "What happens when a doctor calls" "What if I don't have medicine here?"
基于这一情况，觅健开展了一系列针对性活动。
Based on this situation, a series of targeted activities have been carried out.
对于不同需求的患者分别开通医院肿瘤相关门诊开放信息查询工具，让患者可以及时了解附近医院开诊信息；配备全国各地肿瘤药品零售药店地图索引工具及各地长处方政策查询，指导患者购药方便。
For patients with different needs, open information searching tools are opened in out-patient clinics for patients with different needs, so that patients can be informed of the opening information of the nearby hospitals in a timely manner; equipped with map indexing tools and local long-term prescription policy inquiries throughout the country.
其中最重要的是，由上海交通大学附属胸科医院肿瘤科主任陆舜教授牵头的全国百位专家免费义诊活动。
The most important of these was the free medical consultations conducted by 100 specialists nationwide under the leadership of Professor Luo Shun, Head of Oncology Department of the Chest Hospital attached to Shanghai Jiaotong University.
该活动由中国抗癌协会肺癌青年委员会、中国抗癌协会肺癌专业委员会、中国初级卫生保健基金会、中华医学会肿瘤学分会肺癌专业委员会联合主办，觅健、零氪、阿斯利康联合支持，针对肺癌患者切实关心的问题展开在线答疑公益直播和线上免费义诊。
The campaign is jointly sponsored by the China Association Against Cancer Youth Committee, the Special Committee on Lung Cancer of the Chinese Cancer Society, the China Primary Health Care Foundation and the Special Committee on Lung Cancer of the Chinese Medical Association.
“由于出行的不便，加上很多医院减少了门诊量，肺癌患者对于病情的延误、疫情下的自我防护等存在诸多困惑，为此，我们联合了全国各地一百多位肿瘤专家，利用业余时间做免费一对一的义诊，让患者都可以有机会和全国的专家网上交流，从而指导患者得到规范化诊疗。
"Because of the inconvenience of traveling and the fact that many hospitals have reduced the number of outpatient consultations, patients with lung cancer are confused about delays and self-protection against the epidemic. To this end, we have joined more than 100 oncologists from all over the country for free one-on-one consultations in their spare time.
”陆舜教授在首场公益直播中说道。
"Professor Shun Lu said in the first pro bono broadcast.
陆舜教授在“肺凡力量·疫问医答”做线上公益直播家住浙江舟山的一位55岁肺癌患者李煦（化名）就是获益者之一。
Professor Luo Shun, a 55-year-old lung cancer patient living in Zhoushan, Zhejiang Province, is one of the beneficiaries.
2018年底李煦确诊多发性肺癌，一直在上海胸科医院治疗，目前结节太多已不能手术，持续服用原研靶向药易瑞沙治疗中。
By the end of 2018, Li genial diagnosis of multiple lung cancer, has been in Shanghai Chest Hospital treatment, too much nodules can not be surgery, continue to take the original target of the drug Iressa treatment.
因为从确诊到后续治疗一直都是在上海进行，但如今受疫情影响，到上海需要先隔离14天才能就诊，就会出现病情延误情况。
Because from diagnosis to follow-up treatment has been carried out in Shanghai, but now affected by the epidemic, to go to Shanghai needs to be isolated for 14 days, there will be delays.
通过觅健专家线上义诊渠道，李煦如愿实现就诊，并通过线下药店配送服务，足不出户就拿到了药物，也避免了来回上海和医院就医过程中的交叉感染风险。
Through the on-line medical treatment channels of health professionals, Li genial medical treatment, and through the delivery of online pharmacy services, not out of the house to get drugs, and avoid the risk of cross-infection in Shanghai and hospitals.
刘文桂说，目前在觅健平台上已经举办了48场关于肿瘤疾病的公益直播，观看人次超过50万次。
Liu said 48 live public service broadcasts on oncology have been held on the health platform, with more than half a million views.
与癌症患者一起，与生命赛跑最近抗击疫情不断传来好消息，全国很多地区新增病例“清零”，中国工程院院士张伯礼在接受媒体采访时表示，武汉也有望在三月底实现新增病例“清零”。
Wuhan is also on track to see zero new cases by the end of March, Zhang Burley, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, told reporters in an interview with reporters.
疫情好转下，医疗资源的挤压得以缓解，癌症病人正常的医疗秩序将逐步恢复。
When the epidemic improves, the squeeze on medical resources will be alleviated and the normal medical order for cancer patients will gradually be restored.
2月17日，湖北省卫健委公布全省接诊非新冠肺炎患者的医疗机构名单，要求各地做好疫情期间非新冠肺炎患者医疗救治工作。
On Feb. 17, Hubei Provincial Health Committee announced the list of non-new crown pneumonia patients in the province, requiring all localities to do a good job during the outbreak of non-crown pneumonia.
湖北省部分接诊非新冠肺炎患者的医疗机构名单（来源于湖北省卫健委官网）作为疫情中新冠肺炎重症患者定点救治医院，宋启斌所在的武汉大学人民医院，也于3月10日在其官网宣布，该院首义院区（老院区）将分步、有序恢复普通门诊。
The Hospital of Wuhan University, where Mr. Song lives, announced on March 10 that the hospital's first justice district (old courtyard) would resume regular outpatient clinics in a phased and orderly manner.
但对癌症患者的帮助仍在持续。
But help for cancer patients continues.
宋启斌表示湖北省临床肿瘤学会肺癌诊疗一体化中心(iLCC)平台义诊活动准备了近30场，“每天都在做”。
Song said the Hubei Clinical Oncology Society's integrated center for lung cancer diagnosis and treatment (iLCC) platform prepared nearly 30 sessions, "done every day."
而距离湖北700多公里的浙江，也在依托浙江省抗癌协会肺癌诊疗一体化中心（iLCC）项目，开展“肺癌专家线上视频患教、互动答疑”公益活动，组织本省权威肺癌专家，通过视频网络面对面提问解答的形式，为肺癌患者答疑解惑、排忧解难。
Zhejiang Province, more than 700 kilometers away from Hubei, is also relying on the Zhejiang Association of Cancer Association lung cancer diagnosis and treatment center (iLCC) project, launched "lung cancer experts online video, interactive answers" public welfare activities, the organization of the province's authoritative lung cancer experts, through the video network face-to-face questions and answers for lung cancer patients, troubleshooting.
“公益直播和义诊平台每周会安排三至四场，线上诊疗热度还在持续，不会随着门诊恢复而快速降下来。
"The pro bono and free clinic platforms are scheduled three to four times a week, and the online fever is not expected to slow down as the clinic recovers.
”刘文桂相信以后线上诊疗将成为未来线下医疗的就医补充。
"Liu believes that online care will be a supplement to future off-line care.
疫情之下，没有人能置身事外，这是一场群体战“疫”。
Under the epidemic, no one can stay out of the epidemic, which is a mass war "epidemic."
从支援疫区的前线医护人员，到捐款捐物的社会各界人士，从忙到“跑断腿”的快递小哥，到居家抗疫的个人，以及在疫情期间为非冠患者变得异常忙碌的医生、企业和相关人员，都在为了相同的目的在努力，人人都在贡献，人人都是英雄。
From front-line medical workers in support of epidemic areas to people from all walks of life, from express couriers who are busy with running broken legs, to individuals who fight against SARS in their homes, and doctors, businesses, and associates who have become extremely busy with non-crowding patients during the epidemic, all working towards the same end, everyone contributing and everyone being a hero.
疫情终将过去，当再回想起2020年的最初，温暖和感动我们将一直铭记。
The epidemic will pass, and when we look back to the beginning of 2020, we will always remember the warmth and the touch.
