凌晨发出那条分享购药经验的微博后，轰仔当上了抑郁症病友的“志愿者”——借助网上医疗平台购药、转赠、远程代购等途径，帮病友们解决断药问题。
In the early hours of the morning, after posting the microblog sharing experience, Rob became a "volunteer" for those suffering from depression - using online medical platforms to buy medicine, subcontract, and purchase over a distance to help patients cope with the drug problem.
“志愿者”不止她一个。
She wasn't the only volunteer.
他们通过微博、微信群互助购药，也彼此“取暖”。
They buy medicines through microblogging, micro-credit groups, and each other "warm."
全文4102字，阅读约需8分钟“不知道有没有像我一样受疫情影响，难以外出拿药的抑郁症患者朋友们呢。
It takes about 8 minutes to read the full text of 4102 words. "I wonder if there are any depressed friends like me who are affected by the epidemic and have difficulty getting medicine outside
”2月8日凌晨4时23分，轰仔仍然没有睡着。
"At 4: 23 a.m. on February 8, the bomber remained awake.
她掏出手机发了一条微博，把自己购药成功的经验分享给病友们。
She took out her cell phone and posted a microblog to share her success with her patients.
疫情之下，全国多地封闭管理。
Under the epidemic situation, many parts of the country closed management.
湖北内外的近百心理、精神疾病患者，陆续发出求助声音。
Hubei and outside the nearly 100 psychological, mental illness patients, successively issued a call for help.
从凌晨这条微博开始，轰仔当上了病友们的“志愿者”——借助网上医疗平台购药、互助转赠、远程代购等“自救”途径，帮助病友们解决断药问题。
Starting in the wee hours of the morning, the blogger has become a "volunteer" for his patients - using online medical platforms to buy medicine, mutual aid grants, and telemarketing to help their sick friends solve their drug-related problems.
“志愿者”不止她一个。
She wasn't the only volunteer.
多位患者通过微博、微信群互助购药，也彼此“取暖”。
Many patients through micro-blogging, micro-groups to buy medicine, but also each other "heating."
早些时候因关注疫情而陷入焦虑的轰仔，最近每天“忙得像996”，反而感觉充实多了。
The blockbuster, who had been worried about the outbreak earlier, has been feeling much fuller these days "as busy as 996."
她说，做这些事情起码比发呆有意义。
'Doing these things is at least more meaningful than being in a daze, 'she says.
国家卫健委2月18日的通知中，特别关注了封闭管理区居住的严重精神障碍患者，要求采取送药上门、远程医疗等方式，保障患者居家治疗。
In its circular of 18 February, the State Council for Health Care paid special attention to persons with severe mental disorders living in closed administrative areas and called for home delivery, telemedicine and other means to guarantee home treatment.
这意味着，双相情感障碍等严重精神障碍患者，或将率先得到更多“获救”渠道。
This means that people with severe mental disorders, such as bipolar disorder, may be the first to be rescued.
▲2月9日，轰仔发布微博分享了自己的线上购药经验。
On Feb. 9, Rob released Weibo to share his online drug buying experience.
受访者供图━━━━━“停摆”的日常距离第一次发病约一年半后，去年底，轰仔再次确诊重度抑郁、重度焦虑。
2007-9-24 16: 48 The Daily Routine Distance About a year and a half after the first onset of symptoms, at the end of last year, Rob was again diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety.
她在外地上大学、就诊，过年回家时，本想在假期结束后回学校所在地复诊取药，但受疫情影响假期延长，余药不足。
When she returned home from college and the New Year, she wanted to go back to the school after the holidays to get some medicine, but the epidemic affected her vacation and the medicine was insufficient.
2月初，她手中的抗抑郁药盐酸文拉法辛就只剩下了几天的药量，那时小区已经封闭限行，当地精神卫生中心精神科门诊近期也无排班，她于是选择网络求助。
Her antidepressant, Venlafaxine Hydrochloride, had only a few days left in early February, when the community was closed and the psychiatric clinic at the local mental health centre had no immediate shift. She turned to the Internet for help.
由于精神类药物属处方药，一次通常不会开超过一个月的药量，且需要根据病情遵医嘱调整，此前患者都在相对固定的医院复诊、开药。
Because psychotropic drugs are prescribed by prescription, they usually do not last more than a month at a time and need to be adjusted according to the patient's condition.
疫情发生后，许多抑郁症患者的日常“停摆”了。
After the outbreak of depression, many patients with daily "stop."
2月5日，晓露通过微博发出求助。
On 5 February, Xiaolu sent out a request for help through Weibo.
在她朋友的一个“病友群”中，也有38位来自武汉或周边地区的患者，依次讲述了自己的困境：“刘某人，抑郁发作，因为新型病毒影响不能去武汉开药，加上县医院根本无法购买到精神类药物，已停药”；“徐某某，患心理疾病5年，因道路封闭，社区医院无精神类药物等原因，已被迫停药2天”；“王某，患双相情感障碍六年，因道路封闭无法开药已经停药”……晓露对接的群里都是武汉及周边城市的患者，除了“封城封路封社区”导致的出行难，还有人因曾逗留武汉被隔离，被“封”在县城、村镇的患者则苦于身边医疗资源的匮乏，“几乎所有人都断药了”。
Some 38 patients from Wuhan or surrounding areas described their plight in turn: "Someone Liu, depressed because the impact of the new virus can not go to Wuhan, coupled with the county hospital can not purchase psychotropic drugs, and has been forced to stop medicine for five years, because of closed roads, community hospitals have no psychiatric drugs.
为了节省药物，有人选择自行减药，决定把剩下的药物掰成两半吃，延长服药时间。
In order to save drugs, some people choose to reduce their own medicine, decided to break the remaining drugs into two halves, lengthen the time to take medicine.
有人停药后出现戒断反应，头晕、头疼、胸闷是常见反应，严重者“头疼得像要裂开，吃止痛药也无法缓解”。
Some people after the withdrawal reaction, dizziness, headaches, chest tightness is a common reaction, severe "headache like splitting, painkillers can not be alleviated."
还有人出现眼球刺痛感，“有点像触电”。
Others have a tingling eyeball, "a bit like electrocution."
患者自主断药或减药，会面临很大的风险。
Patients will face great risk if they are deprived of their own medicine or medication.
北京师范大学心理学部硕士生导师林钗华介绍，突然停止服用抗抑郁药物，很多患者会出现非常明显的焦虑症状，包括失眠、恐慌、噩梦等，然后可能会出现更严重的抑郁症状，甚至自杀意念，很大程度上会增加自杀的风险。
Many patients will experience very significant anxiety symptoms, including insomnia, panic attacks, nightmares, and possibly more severe depressive symptoms and even suicidal thoughts, which can greatly increase the risk of suicide, said Lin Hifu, a master's degree supervisor at Beijing Normal University.
“双相情感障碍和中重度抑郁患者，遵医嘱服药是非常重要的，”林钗华说，“和开始服药时的适应过程相似，每个人停药的过程也有其独特性。
"It is important for people with bipolar disorder and moderate or severe depression to be medically prescribed to take the drug," said Lin Chaifu.
不管是开始服药，还是逐渐减药，都需要在医生严格监控下进行。
Whether you start taking drugs or gradually reduce them, you need to be under the strict supervision of your doctor.
”━━━━━求助与分享疫情的压力、求药的焦虑之下，患者们开始寻找“自救”的方法。
2006-03-20 09: 48 Seeking help and sharing the stress of the epidemic and the anxiety of finding a cure for it, the sufferers began to look for ways to help themselves.
晓露和朋友的求助信，在微博、朋友圈等平台发出后，当天就收到很多反馈。
Xiaolu and friends asked for help in the micro-blog, circle of friends and other platforms, the same day received a lot of feedback.
病友们在回复中分享了不少网上医疗平台，有“好大夫”“1药网”“健客网上药房”“好心情互联网医院”等。
In response, patients shared a number of online medical platforms, including "good doctor", "1 medicine network", "health online pharmacy" "good mood Internet hospital."
“开始收到求助信息时，都没往网上平台想，因为觉得大家肯定都试过了。
"When I started getting help, I didn't think about it because I felt sure everyone had tried.
”晓露说，没想到一下发现这么多平台可以使用。
'I didn't expect to see so many platforms available, 'says Ms. Xiaolu.
轰仔的“成功经验”也很偶然。
His "success story" is also accidental.
翻看病历单时，轰仔无意间找到一张主治的二维码名片，扫码后发现上传病历和处方单就可以购药。
Looking at the chart, Rob inadvertently found a two-dimensional code business card, scan the code and found that uploading medical records and prescription can buy medicine.
2月7日早上7点多，轰仔提交了开药订单，11点左右用药审核通过。
February 7, more than 7 a.m., Rob submitted a drug order, about 11 drug clearance passed.
8日下午2点左右，订单显示“药品开始配送”。
At about 2: 00 p.m. on the 8th, the order showed "Medicines start to be distributed."
购药成功后，轰仔在微博上分享了线上购药经验，并通过朋友帮忙转发扩散。
After the success of the drug purchase, Rob shared his online drug-buying experience on Weibo and helped spread the spread through friends.
“那天我去吃个饭回来，评论就多了一两百条。
"I came back from a meal the other day with one or two hundred more comments.
”轰仔没想到会受到这么多关注：有人反映所需药物缺货，有的网上医疗平台快递不发湖北，还有网友表示愿意无偿赠药，部分平台也通过官博主动前来联系……两天后，这条微博的转发量超过了6000。
"Rob didn't expect so much attention: some said they were short of medicine, some said they would not deliver Hubei by express delivery, others said they would give medicine free of charge, and some of the platforms came unsolicited through official blogs.
由于湖北地区患者反映的问题最集中复杂，轰仔和此前联系的一位武汉病友又组建了“疫区病友互助群”，通过私信、去微博“抑郁症超话”里找人等方式联系求助者，很快有来自武汉、黄冈、宜昌、仙桃、荆州等地的40余位患者进群。
As the patients in Hubei area most concentrated and complex problems, Rob and the previous contact with a friend of Wuhan set up "epidemic areas of mutual help groups," through personal letters, Weibo "depression super-talk" to find people, and soon from Wuhan, Huanggang, Yichang, Xiantao, Jingzhou and other places into the group.
收集病友需求、分享购药经验、对接平台客服……轰仔和晓露在这些病友中，承担起“志愿者”的工作。
Collect patient demand, share drug purchase experience, docking platform customer service...... rob and xiao Lu in these sick friends, undertake the "volunteer" work.
“我会把我能找到的所有渠道都发给求助的病友，也提倡大家把尝试成功的途径都发到群里，比如通过什么方法买到了哪些药、花了多长时间等等。
"I send every avenue I can find to my sick fellow patients, and I encourage everyone to share their success stories, such as what medicines I buy and how long it takes.
”轰仔说。
"said the rookie.
晓露主要负责与不同渠道平台的沟通。
Xiaolu is mainly responsible for communication with different channel platforms.
经联络确认，湖北以外地区除少数二类精神药品之外，几大平台均可发货，且有平台即使没有处方，也可通过在线问诊由医生给出“用药建议”，经药师审核后开药。
Liaison confirmed that outside Hubei region, except for a few types of psychotropic drugs, several major platforms can be delivered, and even if there is no prescription, can be online consultation by the doctor "medicine advice," the pharmacist after the review of medication.
湖北当地，也有平台可以通过中国邮政EMS发货；发往武汉可以走顺丰绿色通道。
Hubei, there is also a platform can be shipped through China Post EMS; sent to Wuhan can take Shunfeng green channel.
下单成功后，大家都松了一口气。
Everyone heaved a sigh of relief at the success of the order.
2月14日，早先下单的患者已有人反馈收到药。
On 14 February, patients who had previously placed an order received feedback on the drugs received.
“其他人虽然还没收到药，但不那么焦虑了。
"The others haven't gotten the medicine yet, but they're not so anxious.
”晓露说，此前群里求助的病友们大都反馈了好消息，“能买”。
Most of the patients who had sought help in the group had responded with good news, "Buy."
▲晓露联络的“病友群”中，患者们排队讲述自己面临的断药问题。
In a group of sick friends contacted by Xiao Lu, patients queued up to talk about their problems with drugs.
受访者供图━━━━━新一轮尝试不久后，被寄予“厚望”的网上平台出现了新的状况。
2007-9-24 16: 48 A new attempt was soon followed by the emergence of a new situation on the online platform on which high hopes were placed.
最近，晓露又被拉进了一个病友群，反馈集中在平台不发货，“有人下单9天都没发货，客服回答也很模糊”。
Recently, Xiaolu was pulled into a group of sick friends, feedback focused on the platform do not deliver, "someone ordered nine days did not deliver goods, customer service answers are vague."
她联系之前沟通过的平台工作人员，得到的回复是，平台最近“爆单”了。
She contacted the Platform staff she had previously communicated with and was told that the platform had recently "exploded."
“我们已经调配20多人志愿服务运营部了，仓库的人都是24小时打包发货”，但订单“实在太多了”。
"We have deployed more than 20 volunteer operators and the warehouse people are packing and shipping 24 hours a day," but the orders are "far too many."
工作人员解释，该平台有北京、温州、广州和徐州四个仓库，但只有徐州仓可以发往湖北，“是政府指定给湖北配送物资的专线，有时候徐州库房没货，只能从广州和温州顺丰调到徐州，再从徐州EMS给湖北。
Staff explained that the platform had four warehouses: Beijing, Wenzhou, Guangzhou and Xuzhou, but only Xuzhou warehouse could be sent to Hubei, "a special line designated by the government for the distribution of materials to Hubei.
”轰仔也遇到了类似情况，“有病友私信我说平台药房里的盐酸文拉法辛缺货了一天”，此外，还有一些管控较严的二类精神药物各平台都无法买到。
A similar story happened to Rob. "Some patients privately believe that Venlafaxine hydrochloride was out of stock for a day at the platform pharmacy" and there were platforms for more tightly controlled psychotropic substances in category II that were not available.
一些病友转向了其他尝试。
Some of the sick have turned to other attempts.
很多人选择了转赠药品。
Many chose to sub-donate medicines.
在轰仔身边，有人委托在医院工作的亲友邻居帮忙转交，“一手病历一手拿药”，也有很多愿意无偿赠药的朋友联系到有需要的患者，经病历或处方单、药盒等信息核实后，转寄给对方。
At Rob's side, someone entrusted the relatives and neighbors working in the hospital to transfer the "one-handed medical records", but also a lot of friends willing to give medicine free of charge contact patients in need, through medical records or prescription sheets, medicine boxes, and other information verification, forward to the other side.
“很多转赠人都是自付邮费的，我听说之后挺感动的。
"I was touched to hear that many subgrantees pay for their own postage.
”轰仔说。
"said the rookie.
一位曾患抑郁、现已康复的重庆网友主动联系轰仔说可以帮大家买药。
A depressed Chongqing netizen who has now recovered from depression volunteered to contact Rob and said he could buy medicine for everyone.
有来自湖北黄冈的患者在群里求助后，5天就收到了通过邮政快递送达的药物。
A patient from Huanggang, Huanggang, Hubei Province, received a drug delivered by courier service within five days after seeking help from the group.
根据病友们的反馈，这比平台到货的时间要短得多。
According to the patients' feedback, this is much shorter than the arrival of the platform.
身在武汉的群主，还把在医院开的药通过外卖“跑腿”服务寄给出门不便的同城群友。
In Wuhan, the group master, but also the medicine prescribed in the hospital through take-out "errands" service sent to the inconvenient group of city friends.
晓露也遇到相似的例子。
Xiaolu encountered a similar case.
有一位湖北病友的药管制非常严格，在所有平台都买不到，最后通过网友联系到河南焦作一位精神科医生，把身份信息、诊断证明发给他，医生通过医院开了药，再通过邮政寄出。
One patient in Hubei Province had very strict drug control and could not be bought on all platforms. Finally, he was contacted by Internet users as a psychiatrist in Jiao, Henan Province.
为了尽快帮助更多人解决药物问题，轰仔每天要回复大量病友的留言，最长时一天回复七八个小时。
To help more people deal with the drug problem as soon as possible, Rob responded to a large number of messages a day, up to seven or eight hours a day.
每晚睡前，她都会看一遍私信，确认求助的病友们是否已收到货，跟他们聊聊天。
Every night before going to bed, she would read a private letter to make sure that her fellow patients had received the supplies and talked to them.
不久前，轰仔的群里也来了一位医生，这给了病友们很大信心。
Not long ago, a doctor came to Rob's group, which gave his patients a lot of confidence.
“之前大家像没头苍蝇一样找信息，现在可以直接跟医生对接咨询、开药，私人快递也可以比较快到达，我觉得这比很多安慰都更有用一些。
"I think it's more useful than a lot of reassurance that we've been looking for information like no-fly, that we can now talk directly to doctors and prescribe drugs and that private couriers can arrive relatively quickly.
”━━━━━“不要放弃”疫情的持续，还给不少患者带来了新的心理困扰。
The persistence of the epidemic has also brought new psychological distress to many patients.
“和普通民众一样，已诊断的患者也会出现一些相似的应激反应。
"As in the general population, there are similar stress responses in diagnosed patients.
”林钗华说，外界的一些压力因素比如当前疫情带来的压力，很可能会影响患者的病情进展，甚至可能增加躁狂或是抑郁发作的几率。
Hairpin said some external stressors, such as the current outbreak, are likely to affect patients' progress and may even increase the risk of mania or depression.
基于此，不少专业团队也在通过远程心理咨询等方式提供帮助。
Based on this, many professional teams are also providing help through remote counseling and other means.
自1月27日起，林钗华所在的北师大团队面向全国公众开通了疫情心理支持热线4001888976和网络辅导服务，接到大量来访者求助，其中因抑郁相关情绪来电的约占6%-7%，5%左右的人曾有过心理问题。
Since January 27, Lin's team at the North Normal University has set up an epidemic psychology support hotline 4001888976 for the nation's public and Internet counselling services, and has received a large number of visitors, of whom about 6-7% are from depression-related emotions, about 5% of whom have experienced psychological problems.
病友们这种焦虑，轰仔感同身受。
These anxieties are shared by the sick.
“有一些比较严重的患者来求助时特别焦虑，那种悲伤的情绪隔着屏幕都能感受到，我看到之后自己也比较触动，一下子有些受不了。
"Some of the more serious patients are particularly anxious when they come to ask for help, and that sad feeling can be felt across the screen.
”轰仔觉得，对于他们来说言语安慰其实非常贫瘠无力，就跟对方说“大家都在努力想办法，一定不要放弃”。
"Rob felt that words of comfort to them were actually very barren and powerless, so he said to the other person," We are all trying to find a way, we must not give up. "
一些患者面临更为隐秘的问题。
Some patients face more secretive problems.
晓露在沟通中发现，一些病友因为心理疾病污名化甚至不愿透露自己的困境。
Xiaolu found in the communication, some patients because of the stigma of mental illness even unwilling to disclose their plight.
林钗华认为，这是患者们在求助过程中最大的障碍。
Hairpin believes that this is the biggest obstacle patients face in their quest for help.
她想要告诉他们，直面自己的困难并且及时求助，本身就是一种勇敢的表现。
She wanted to tell them that facing their own difficulties and asking for help in time was a sign of bravery.
东北的张童患抑郁障碍加焦虑症已有半年时间，“我最开始也不敢告诉家人病情，但是还是要面对。
Zhang Tong in the Northeast has been suffering from depression and anxiety disorder for six months. "I didn't dare to tell my family about it at first, but I still had to face it.
”张童认为家人还是比较理性的，“不要偷偷摸摸，还是要获得家人的支持。
"Zhang Tong said his family was still more rational and" don't sneak around and still get support from their families.
”“我们所有人在不同时期都会经历不同的困扰。
"" We all go through different kinds of trouble at different times.
希望通过这次疫情，公众能意识到心理困扰的普遍性，让所有人都可以在需要的时候，及时地、勇敢地寻求专业的支持。
It is hoped that with this outbreak, the public will become aware of the prevalence of psychological distress, so that everyone can seek professional support in a timely and courageous manner when needed.
”林钗华说。
"said Lin Hairpin.
━━━━━“做些事情”林钗华还发现，较多来访的确诊患者，一直没有服药或获得其他帮助，或只是短暂服药便自主停药、接受了一小段时间非持续的专业帮助，并没有得到非常好的康复。
John Lin Hairpin also found that many of the diagnosed patients visiting the United States had not been receiving medication or other help, or had stopped taking drugs themselves for a short time without continuing professional help, and had not recovered very well.
“如果他们之前已经接受了很好的治疗和支持，可能反倒在这个过程中会体现出非常多的优势和资源，因为他们有很多的应对方式。
"If they have received good treatment and support before, they may be able to demonstrate a lot of strengths and resources in the process because they have many coping styles.
”林钗华说。
"said Lin Hairpin.
她为抑郁症患者们提出了不少建议。
She made a number of suggestions for people with depression.
比如，留意导致自己出现心理状况的“触发事件”，一些“丧失”（指离异、亲人离世等）或是悲伤的事情。
Consider, for example, the "triggers" that cause you to feel a mental condition, some "loss" (meaning divorce, death, etc.) or something sad.
同时应留意一些征兆：比如抑郁患者可能发现自己会社交回避，双相患者可能睡眠突然减少，其他可能还包括食欲变化等等。
Also be aware of signs that depression patients may find themselves shunning society, that bipolar disorder may cause a sudden loss of sleep, and that other symptoms may include changes in appetite.
她建议，采取相应的行动，尽量减少一些可能诱发病情的风险因素，比如说保持惯常的睡眠习惯、更好地进行人际沟通，获取一些社会和家庭的支持，包括接受专业帮助等。
She recommends that action be taken to minimize some of the risk factors that may lead to illness, such as maintaining habitual sleeping habits, better interpersonal communication, and obtaining some social and family support, including professional help.
“我们越是不做什么，情绪可能就会变得越糟糕，不断地陷入抑郁的循环中。
"The more we do nothing, the worse our emotions can get and the more we fall into a cycle of depression.
”林钗华建议，尽量安排一些让自己比较愉悦的活动改善情绪，也可以尝试一些认知的技术，有意识地识别和挑战自己的负面思维。
Hairpin suggests that you try to arrange some activities that will make you happier, or try some cognitive techniques to consciously identify and challenge your negative thoughts.
轰仔也清楚地感受到了这一点。
This was also clearly felt by the blockbuster.
较早关注疫情的她，前些天一直处于焦虑中。
Early attention to the outbreak of her, the last few days has been in anxiety.
她说，每天刷新闻越刷越难受，整个假期都过得比较差。
'Brushing the news every day gets worse and worse, 'she says.
最近,由于在网上和病友沟通求药，轰仔突然间“每天忙得像996”，反倒感觉充实一些。
Recently, as a result of online communication with patients seeking medicine, Rob suddenly "busy as 996", but feel more substantial.
“我以前可以躺在床上发呆几个小时，做这些事情起码比发呆有意义。
"I used to be able to lie in bed for a few hours, doing these things was at least more meaningful than being in a daze.
”轰仔说。
