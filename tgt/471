经济观察报 见习记者 陈月芹 一则“社区多个楼栋发热”告示漫天飞舞，将地处武汉市区东北的百步亭社区，重新拉回舆论的中心。
Chen Yueqin, a trainee reporter for the Economic Observer, said a "fever in several buildings in the community" notice was flying all over the sky.
。
.
尽管2月4日百步亭社区对媒体的一次回应中说没有确诊案例，然而在这个管辖11个小区，13万居民的社区中，“发热”、“新冠肺炎”，一定是过去两三周中最重要的关键词。
Despite a media response on February 4 that there were no confirmed cases, fever and pneumonia must have been the most important keywords of the past two or three weeks in a community that governs 11 small districts and 130,000 residents.
。
.
百步亭受到了前所未有的关注，源于在2020年1月18日农历小年这天举办的一场声势浩大的“万家宴”。
The pavilion has received unprecedented attention as a result of a huge "family feast" on January 18, 2020, the Chinese lunar year.
。
.
尽管宴会前一天，武汉市累计报告新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎病例62例，已治愈出院19例，在治重症8例，死亡2例。
Although Wuhan city reported 62 cases of pneumonia with new coronavirus infection the day before the banquet, 19 cases were cured, 8 serious cases and 2 deaths were cured.
但是真正让百步亭为世人瞩目，是两天后中国工程院院士钟南山提示新冠肺炎“肯定会人传人”。
But it was two days later that Zhong Nan Shan, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, suggested that the new crown pneumonia would "surely pass from person to person."
。
.
如临大敌的网民在尝试寻找当地政府和卫生部门没有对疫情给予足够重视和准备证据时，在当地媒体《楚天都市报》19日的头版头条上找到了他们想要的：。
When netizens trying to find local government and health authorities did not pay enough attention to the epidemic and prepare the evidence, they found what they wanted on the front page of the local newspaper Chu Tian Metropolis Daily.
“2020年的万家宴汇聚4万多家庭、13986道菜肴。
"In 2020, 10,000 dinners will bring together more than 40,000 families and 13,986 dishes.
当天，百步亭社区内，9个居委会特设楼栋、片区、苑区、社区等家宴，邀请社区空巢老人、失独老人、志愿者等走出家门，品家宴、庆团圆。
On the same day, 9 neighborhood committees in the community, special floor, block, park, community banquet, and other family banquet, invited the community empty nest elderly, the elderly, volunteers and other out of the home, taste family dinner, reunion.
”。
"
很难证明，今天社交媒体上热传的百步亭社区楼栋发热信息，能与当时的大型聚会严格对应起来，但社区工作人员目前已经在疫情中筋疲力尽确是事实。
It's hard to prove that today's social-media buzz about the Baumbuting community building is strictly comparable to the big parties of the day, but it is true that community workers are now exhausted by the epidemic.
武汉市长周先旺也就此反思政府“预警不够”。
Wuhan City Chang Zhou Xianwang also reflected on the government's "inadequate warning."
。
.
经济观察报获取的信息显示，一些社区内的“高度疑似”的重症病人参加过那场“万家宴”。
Information obtained by the Economic Observer showed that "highly suspicious" patients in some communities had attended the "mass dinner."
。
.
当时整个社区都对疫情毫不知情吗？一位名为许志的社区工作者说，他周边的社区工作人员是知道的，“18号当天武汉还没有封城，但我们有内部一些消息，说会封（城）。
A community worker named Xu Zhi said he knew from community workers around him that Wuhan had not been closed down on the 18th, but we had inside information that it would be sealed.
但是宴会还是照常搞了”。
But the party went on as usual.
。
.
万家宴前，许志私下让家人和朋友不要去参加，但自己还是去了。
Before the family dinner, Xu Zhi privately asked his family and friends not to participate, but he went.
。
.
由于并没有准确的确诊数据和结论，万家宴反而成为了居民们不愿主动提及的话题，因为眼前社区普遍出现的发热和疾病，需要他们全力捱过去。
In the absence of accurate diagnostic data and conclusions, however, mass dinners have become a topic that residents are reluctant to volunteer to mention, as the widespread fever and disease in their communities require their full support.
。
.
“发热”的百步亭。
"Fever" of the 100 steps.
叶琪一家住在武汉市江岸区百步亭社区，父母均疑似感染，63岁的叶母在1月21日便出现高烧症状。
The Yeqi family, who live in the Bumbuting community in the Jiangan district of Wuhan, are both suspected to be infected, and a 63-year-old mother developed high fever on January 21.
。
.
早先的新闻说医院发热门诊开始超负荷，倡导出现发热、咳嗽的轻症病人居家隔离。
Earlier news that the hospital fever clinic began to overload, advocating the emergence of fever, cough in the home isolation of light patients.
“当时妈妈情况还好，只是发烧，就居家隔离了5天。
"Mom was fine, she had a fever and was kept in quarantine for five days.
” 叶琪说。
'she said.
。
.
后来叶母开始呼吸困难，1月28日去社区指定的汉口医院发热门诊做CT，医院诊断双肺感染，高度疑似病毒性肺炎。
Later leaf mother began to have difficulty breathing, January 28 to the community-designated Hankou Hospital fever clinic to do CT, hospital diagnosis of dual lung infection, highly suspected viral pneumonia.
由于没有试剂盒，至今未能确诊。
Due to the absence of test kits, no diagnosis has been made.
。
.
15天来，叶母每天去医院打针，但病情日益严重， 2天前已出现多次晕倒休克，再去复查时，医生说肺胃肝脏等器官开始衰竭，让家属赶紧联系社区安排住院。
For 15 days, Ye went to the hospital for daily injections, but her condition was getting worse. When she came back two days ago and had fainted repeatedly, the doctor said the lungs, liver and other organs were beginning to fail.
。
.
叶琪梳理了母亲去医院的时间段：如果上午8点去医院，下午大概3-4点回；如果晚上7-8点去，得到第二天凌晨5点回家。
Ye Qi combed her mother to the hospital time period: if 8 a.m. to the hospital, about 3-4 p.m. back, if 7-8 p.m., the next morning the 5 a.m. home.
有一次夜里11点去，也到第二天5-6点回来。
One night at eleven o'clock, and the next day at five to six.
。
.
“我们一直想减少妈妈在医院的时间，避免交叉感染，但谁也不知道哪个时间段医院人少一点。
"We've been trying to reduce the amount of time Mom spends in the hospital and avoid cross-infection, but no one knows which hours are less crowded.
”。
"
叶母每天除了在医院排队和打针，就是在家昏睡。
Every day, except in the hospital line up and injection, is sleeping at home.
但不打针更不行，“妈妈快熬不住了”，叶琪说。
But do not hit the needle is not better, "mother will soon be unable to endure," Ye Qi said.
。
.
叶琪每天和社区沟通，一直按照要求自行隔离，按序排队，听从社区安排。
Yeki communicates daily with the community and has been asked to isolate herself, queuing up sequentially and deferring to the community.
她能理解有十几万居民的百步亭社区，床位非常紧张，社区工作人员也很为难。
She understands the hundreds of thousands of residents of the Bumpting community, the bed is very tight, community workers are also difficult.
“给120、社区居委会打电话，都需要打很长一段时间才能拨通，他们确实很忙。
"It takes a long time to call a neighborhood committee. They're really busy.
”。
"
社区工作人员告诉叶琪，她的妈妈已经在重症病人中排第一位了。
Community workers told Ye Qi that her mother had been ranked first among the seriously ill.
“如果有床位，妈妈就能住院。
"If she had a bed, she would be hospitalized.
但妈妈已经排在第一好多天了。
But mom's been in line for the first couple of days.
”。
"
方煜也是百步亭社区居民，他的妈妈至今已经断断续续发烧2周了。
Fang Yu is also a resident of the Bumbuting community, his mother has been intermittently feverish for 2 weeks now.
一开始出现发热，都以为是普通流感，在家吃药观察。
At the beginning of the fever, all think it is common flu, take medicine observation at home.
到第4天，整个人开始浑身乏力，去武汉大学中山医院拍了CT，医生诊断说是肺炎，“不排除武汉肺炎”。
By the fourth day, the whole body began to tired, Wuhan University Zhongshan Hospital took a CT, the doctor diagnosed pneumonia, "do not rule out Wuhan pneumonia.
。
.
起初社区让方妈在家自己隔离，慢慢地，她身体越来越使不上劲，不想吃喝。
At first the community let Fang Ma isolate herself at home. Slowly, her body became more and more restless and she did not want to eat or drink.
看着母亲病情加重，方煜天天去社区居委会，要求安排核酸检测和住院，社区一直都回复：上报了，没试剂盒，没床位，在排位，回去等。
Watching my mother's illness aggravated, Fang Yu every day to the community neighborhood committee, request to arrange nucleic acid testing and hospitalization, the community has always responded: reported, no kit, no beds, in the row, back and so on.
。
.
“请问怎么让一个70岁的老人自行隔离？”方煜多次表示不满，妈妈的病情已经属于重症，生活已经不能自理，不能吃，意识好点时也只能轻声传唤，自己必须在家照顾她。
"How to let a 70-year-old self-isolation?" Fang Yu repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction, mother's illness has been a serious illness, life can no longer care for themselves, can not eat, when better awareness can only be quietly summoned, they must take care of her at home.
而方煜还要照顾不到半岁的女儿。
And Fang Yu still can not take care of half a year old daughter.
。
.
2月4日，方煜看到网上有社区工作人员回应称社区没有人确诊，她表示，这可能是因为很多人都拿不到试剂盒，“说实在的，谁家希望自己家人被确诊？”。
On February 4, Fang saw online community workers response that no one in the community confirmed, she said that this may be because many people do not get the kit, "to tell the truth, who would like their families to be diagnosed?"
像叶家和方家这种有发热病人在家隔离的，在百步亭社区内非常普遍。
Fever-like patients like Ye and Fang are often isolated at home in the Bumpting community.
这是一个庞大的社区，下辖花园现代城、温馨苑、百合苑、怡和苑、安居苑、景兰苑、天顺园、幸福时代、怡康苑、百步家庭和金桥汇共11个小区，共计13万人。
It is a large community comprising 11 districts comprising the Garden, Warm Garden, Lilium Court, Yee Wo Court, Ngai Nga Court, King Lan Court, Tin Shun Garden, Happy Age, Yee Hong Court, Po Pui Family and Golden Bridge.
只是此前，发热、在家隔离无法收治和确诊的现象，是拥有1000万人口的武汉市内很多社区的缩影。
Only earlier, fever, isolation at home and diagnosis of the phenomenon is the 10 million people in Wuhan City epitomize many communities.
。
.
2月4日，百步亭辖区内的安居苑、百合苑业主群内，居委会工作人员公布了小区内出现发热病人的门栋信息。
On February 4, residents of the residents' group in Ngai Nga Court and Lilium Court in the 100-foot pavilion area posted information on the presence of febrile patients in the area.
其中，安居苑A区有12个单元，B区有8个单元，C区有8个单元，D区有7个单元+403栋全栋；百合苑有20个单元+208栋全栋。
Of these, Block A of Ngai Nga Court has 12 units, Area B has 8 units, Area C has 8 units, Area D has 7 units + 403 complete buildings; and Lilium Garden has 20 units + 208 full buildings.
。
.
安居苑共55栋楼里，33栋出现发热病人；百合苑共36栋楼里，17栋出现发热病人。
There were 33 cases of fever in 55 buildings in Ngau Kei Court and 17 cases of fever in a total of 36 buildings in Lilly Garden.
。
.
住在安居苑C区住户张沰看到这个消息，对照着这个名单，一栋楼一栋楼地去实地查看，她所在的C区8个单元楼楼下均被贴上“发热门栋”的标志。
Zhang Zheng, who lives in Area C of Qu Nga Court, saw the news. Building by building was checked against this list, and her eight apartment buildings in Area C were labeled "hot doorposts."
。
.
安居苑55栋楼里33栋被贴上“发热门栋”标志 （图片由受访者提供）。
Thirty-three of the 55 buildings in Ngai Nga Court have been tagged with the "Heat Door" sign (provided by the respondents).
这让她极为紧张，并在社交媒体上发布了“百步亭大规模发热”的消息，也正是这个消息，让百步亭社区重新回到舆论中心。
This made her extremely nervous, and it was the news of the "Hundred Steps Pavilion Massive Fever" posted on social media, and it was the news that brought the community back to the centre of public opinion.
。
.
争议“万家宴”。
Controversy "ten thousand family banquet".
1月18日一大早，百步亭社区志愿者们会托着居民的菜，大队人马敲锣打鼓送去会场。
Early in the morning of January 18, volunteers from the 100-foot pavilion community will support the residents of the dishes, a large number of percussion drums to send to the meeting.
这是个传统活动，社区里参会的老人特别多。
This is a traditional activity in which the community has a particularly large number of elderly participants.
。
.
79岁的吴淑珍是百步亭社区各大活动的常客，连续20年都精心准备菜肴参加万家宴。
Wu Shu-chen, 79, is a regular at events in the Bumpting community and has been meticulously preparing dishes for a multi-family dinner for 20 years.
因为担心自己走得慢，她提前出发了，8:20就到了主会场，一直忙着张罗，到了晚上6点多才回家。
Fearing that she would walk slowly, she set off early, and at 8: 20 she arrived at the main meeting-place, busy with her work, and did not return home until after 6 pm.
。
.

Wu Shu-chen attended the 20th Family Dinner with her elaborate "Happy Meal".
“现场氛围很浓烈，居民热情特别高。
"The atmosphere was very strong and the residents were very enthusiastic.
”吴淑珍回忆刚刚过去三周的万家宴时说，但当时对新冠肺炎疫情，“完全不了解”。
Ms Wu recalled the Wan family dinner just three weeks ago, but said she had "no idea" about the outbreak of pneumonia.
。
.
许志是筹办万家宴活动的工作人员之一。
Xu Zhi was one of the staff who organized the feast.
他回忆说，和往年一样：各个区域所有的志愿者、楼组长、党小组组长提前3天开会商议流程和亮点，布置主会场、分会场，随后给居民发放盘子，让居民在家准备菜品。
He recalled that, as in previous years, all volunteers from all regions, leaders of buildings and leaders of Party groups met three days in advance to discuss the procedures and bright spots, set up the main meeting rooms and branches, and then handed out dishes to residents so that they could prepare food at home.
。
.
当天早上5点开始，工作人员和志愿者到各家各户接收菜品，送到各大会场。
From 5 a.m. on the same day, staff and volunteers went to the homes to receive food and take it to the main meeting place.
。
.
据《楚天都市报》报道，第20届“万家宴”活动当日，4万多个家庭端出合作或单独制作的13986道菜品，摆满主会场和9个分会场，“热闹程度超过以往任何一届”，“大家边吃边聊，畅叙生活暖心事、新变化，共度欢乐农历小年。
According to the Chu Tian Metropolis Daily, on the day of the 20th Lunar New Year, more than 40,000 families served 13,986 dishes made in cooperation or on their own, filling the main hall and nine branches with "more excitement than ever before.
”。
"
“4万多个家庭这一数字有点夸大”，许志说，实际上“万家宴”主会场仅能容纳1000人，主要是社区老人、居委会工作人员、社区志愿者参加，其余居民分布在社区活动中心、居家养老中心等多个分会场。
"The figure of more than 40,000 families is a little exaggerated," Xu said. "In fact, the main hall can accommodate 1,000 people, mainly community elders, neighborhood committee workers, community volunteers, and the rest of the residents are scattered in community activity centers and home care centers.
加上其他社区的流动人口，所有会场实际参加人数可能在1万人-2万人之间。
Combined with the mobile populations of other communities, the actual number of participants in all meetings could be between 10,000 and 20,000.
。
.
一位温馨苑的年轻居民告诉记者，“万家宴”历史已久，但年轻一代居民的兴致越来越低，更不可能家家户户到场，自己和身边的朋友都“很多年没去凑热闹了”。
A young resident of a popular garden told reporters that the "family dinner" had been going on for a long time, but the interest of the younger generation was waning, making it impossible for everyone to come and join the party.
。
.
许志告诉经济观察报记者，百步亭社区2000年由百步亭集团开发建设，从最早的3个居委会发展到今天9个居委会的规模，其实已经到了一个街道的规模。
Xu told the Economic Observer that the Bumpting community was developed and built in 2000 by the Bumbuting Group, from the earliest three neighborhood committees to today's size of nine neighborhood committees, in fact has reached the size of a street.
。

The Bumper Pavilion Community (pictured on the Web).
公开资料显示，百步亭社区内每个小区平均3000多户，11个小区共计3万户，总人口达13万，是全国文明社区示范点、全国和谐社区建设示范社区。
According to public information, each community in the Baebu Pavilion community, an average of more than 3,000 households, 11 sub-districts a total of 30,000 households, a total population of 130,000, is the national civilized community demonstration sites, the construction of harmonious communities throughout the model community.
百步亭集团是以社区地产业为主，社区服务业、金融投资等多元发展的民营企业集团，拥有武汉安居工程发展有限公司、百步亭物业管理有限公司、百步亭国际传媒有限公司等20家下属企业。
As a group of private enterprises mainly engaged in community industry, community service industry, financial investment and other diversified development, the Group has 20 subordinate enterprises such as Wuhan Housing Project Development Co. Ltd., Pa Pu Ting Property Management Co., Ltd.
。
.
早些年社区工作人员的工资由百步亭集团支付，后续通过逐渐改革，民政、劳动、计生等部门分条线拨款给社区，成立百步亭社区管委会，社区承担街道一级的任务，此后百步亭集团也逐步退出社区组织架构。
In earlier years, community workers' salaries were paid by the 100-step pavilion group, which gradually withdrew from the community organization structure after gradual reform, the allocation of line funds from civil affairs, labour, family planning, etc., the establishment of a hundred-step community management committee, and community-level tasks.
但整个社区架构中没有一个公务员编制，社区高层均是百步亭集团的人员。
But the whole community structure does not have a civil service establishment, the community at the top are 100 steps group personnel.
。
.
“百步亭社区以一个企业的模式在运作，因此在出钱出力、团结居民方面办得红火。
"The hundred-foot-pavilion community operates as a one-business model, and is doing well in terms of contributing money and bringing people together.
”许志介绍，20年来，万家宴每年如期举办，“百步亭经验”也常常被作为和谐社区的典范被推广到全国各地学习。
Xu said that over the past 20 years, 10,000 banquets had been held as scheduled each year and the "100-step pavilion experience" was often replicated around the country as a model for harmonious communities.
。
.
第20届万家宴现场热闹非凡 （图片来源于网络）。
The scene of the 20th Wanjie banquet is very noisy (picture comes from the Internet).
标杆立起来后，社区活动的摊子越铺越大， “一次活动铺得很大之后，搞成了吉尼斯世界纪录，上至政府，下到街道、居委会，都纷纷‘立旗’”。
When the posts were erected, the community event spread out. "After a big push, it became the Guinness World Records, from the government down to the streets and neighborhood committees," he said.
。
.
谈起举办万家宴的初衷，许志感慨，20年来万家宴都顺利举办，是一件好事，也是一个和谐社区的标杆案例，但遇到这次疫情，“按武汉话来说，就是‘炸靶’（丢人现眼）了。
Talking about the original intention of holding a multi-family banquet, Xu Zhi lamented that the 20-year-old banquet is a good thing and a benchmark case of a harmonious community, but in this case, "hit the target" in Wuhan dialect.
”。
"
在疫情确诊病例的急剧增加的背景下，整个社区对此毫无知情吗？。
Is the community as a whole unaware of the dramatic increase in confirmed cases of the epidemic?
许志说起了社区同事自1月18日以来对新冠肺炎认知的变化：首先，社区居民只是看到电视上说，肺炎最早来自于华南海鲜市场，武汉市卫健委也发布通报说“可防可控”，‘未发现人传人证据’，此后又说“不排除有限人传人”，因此并没有引发太大的重视。
Xu noted changes in community colleagues' perception of pneumonia since Jan. 18. First, community residents saw only TV that pneumonia originated in the southern Chinese seafood market, and Wuhan Health Commission said it was "preventable and controllable," "no evidence of human-to-human transmission" and later said that "limited human-to-human transmission" had not attracted much attention.
。
.
值得注意的是，1月6日至1月17日期间，武汉通报中没有新增病例。
It is noteworthy that there were no new cases reported in Wuhan between 6 January and 17 January.
期间，武汉市、湖北省两会先后召开。
Wuhan and Hubei provinces held two conferences in succession.
。
.
许志感慨，谁都没往SARS上面想，实在没有想到会发展到今天这么严重。
Xu Zhi lamented that no one thought about SARS, and didn't expect it to be as serious as it is today.
。
.
甲流叠加肺炎，社区居委会工作人员也曾向上级领导提过意见，重新考虑万家宴是否如期举办，但意见最终没有被采用，万家宴如期举办。
A flow superimposed pneumonia, community committee staff members have also been to the higher leadership to reconsider whether the 10,000 dinner was held as scheduled, but the views were not adopted, the 10,000 dinner held as scheduled.
。
.
许志透露，1月18日前后便有武汉封城的声音传出，许志已私下告知亲朋好友注意防范，但万家宴当天自己仍去参加了。
Xu revealed that around January 18, the voice of Wuhan sealing the city, Xu Zhi has privately told relatives and friends to pay attention to prevention, but million dinner day he went to attend.
。
.
1月20日，钟南山在电视上的预警“肯定有人传人”之后，百步亭社区的居民和工作人员开始意识事情的严重性。
On January 20th, residents and workers in the Bumpting community became aware of the seriousness of the situation after Zhong Nan-shan's televised warning "There must be someone passing on."
此前社区的“万家宴”，也在全国媒体平台上被大肆批判。
Before this community "ten thousand family banquet", also was criticized greatly in the national media platform.
。
.
1月21日上了中央电视台的武汉市长周先旺，也必须解释这个问题，他对主持人说， “今年之所以继续举办（百步亭万家宴）这个活动，是基于之前我们对这一次疫情传播是对人与人之间有限性传播的这个判断，对这件事预警不够。
"The reason why we continue to hold the event this year is based on our earlier judgement that the epidemic is spreading from person to person," said Zhou Xianwang, director of Wuhan city, who appeared on CCTV on January 21.
”。
"
“一线”超负荷。
The line is overloaded.
1月22日，湖北省启动突发公共卫生事件二级响应。
On January 22, Hubei Province launched a secondary response to a public health emergency.
当天，百步亭社区要求许志在内的各居委会工作人员上门，各家各户贴告知书，“所有能敲开门通知的，都当面通知了”。
On the same day, the Baebu Ting community asked Xu Zhi, including staff members of the neighborhood, each family posted a notice, "all can knock on the door notice, all face-to-face notice."
。
.
24日中午，大年初一，湖北省宣布启动重大突发公共卫生事件一级响应。
At noon on the 24th, Hubei Province announced the launch of a major public health emergency first-level response.
武汉发布通告，要求封闭所有小区的门，仅留一个门进出。
Wuhan issued a notice, the request to close all the cell doors, leaving only one door in and out.
“小区三个门的保安集中到一个门，给每一个进出居民量体温。
"The security guards at the three gates of the neighborhood gathered at a single door to take the temperature of every inbound and outbound resident.
。
.
当天，政府下发一份武汉市新冠肺炎防控指挥部的7号文件，要求全市各社区负责，全面排查所服务辖区发热病人（含已就医和未就医市民），并送社区卫生中心对病情进行筛选、分类。
On the same day, the government issued a Wuhan New Crown Pneumonia Prevention and Control Command document, the city's communities are responsible for a comprehensive screening of fever patients (both medical and non-medical) in the areas they serve, and sent to community health centres for screening and classification.
与此同时，政府将武汉全市2000多个社区书记的联系方式予以公布。
Meanwhile, the government has published the contact details of more than 2,000 community secretaries in Wuhan.
。
.
这意味着，原先在各大医院间拉锯的抗疫“前线”，下沉到了各个社区。
This means that the "front line" of fighting the disease, which had previously been sawed between major hospitals, sank to communities.
社区是预防和分诊的第一道防线，社区居委会等人员成为抗疫一线工作者。
The community is the first line of defense for prevention and diagnosis. Community neighbourhood committees and other personnel become frontline workers against the epidemic.
。
.
在前所未有的疫情冲击之下，原本负责民政、城管、计生等工作等社区工作者突然面临前所未有的压力。
In the unprecedented impact of the epidemic, originally responsible for civil affairs, urban management, family planning and other community workers suddenly face unprecedented pressure.

“所有人都找社区”，许志表示，每天有很多居民来吵架，要求给床位、做消杀、买菜送菜、提供酒精口罩防护服等。
"Everyone looks for a community," says Xu, who says many residents come to quarrel every day, demanding beds, sterilizations, grocery shopping and alcohol mask suits.
而大年初一以前，社区一线工作者没有物资，只能从自己家拿口罩带上。
Before the New Year's Day, community front-line workers have no supplies, can only take masks from their own homes.

从万家宴到2月5日，许志所在的居委会已有2人生病、2人辞职，原本10余人负责近3800户、13000人的工作量更大了。
From the family dinner to February 5, Xu Zhi's neighborhood committee has two sick, two resigned, the original 10 or so people responsible for nearly 3,800 households, the workload of 13,000 people has increased.
。

接受经济观察报采访时已是晚上9点，许志已连续工作13小时，电话那一头，疲惫不堪的许志边说话，边往“微邻里”、微信群里回复居民的诉求。
It was 9: 00 pm when the Economic Observer interviewed, Xu Zhi had been working continuously for 13 hours. At the other end of the line, Xu Zhibian, exhausted, spoke to the "micro-neighborhood" and replied to the residents' appeals in a microphone group.

武汉卫健委要求，对于需要到发热门诊的病人，各区统一安排车辆送达指定发热门诊就诊。
Wuhan health committee requires that for patients who need to go to the fever clinic, regional arrangements for vehicles to be delivered to the designated fever clinic.
但仅仅车辆这一问题，已经引发不少纠纷。
But the issue of vehicles alone has given rise to a lot of controversy.
。
.
全市禁止车辆私自上路后，交通部门给整个江岸区配了6000台车，1个居委会统一分配3-4台出租车，但这些车仅用于送新冠肺炎以外病人去医院，或满足居民的其他急切的出行诉求。
After the citywide ban on cars on the road, the traffic department has allocated 6,000 cars to the whole river, and one neighborhood committee has allocated three to four taxis, but only for patients other than New Crown Pneumonia to hospitals or to meet other urgent travel demands of residents.
新冠肺炎的病人则坐由警车改装成的专车。
Patients with Newcastle Pneumonia take a special van that has been converted from a police car.
很多病人非常着急送医，但社区居委会人力、运力、物资非常不足，陷入两难。
Many patients are very anxious to see a doctor, but community committee manpower, capacity, supplies are very inadequate, a dilemma.
。
.
社区内确诊的人数如何确认的？面对经济观察报记者提出的问题，许志反问，“你说‘确诊’，是什么意思？”。
How to confirm the number of people diagnosed in the community? In response to a question from the Economic Observer reporter, Xu Zhi asked, "What do you mean by 'diagnosed'?"
许志说，目前媒体所说的“确诊”是指病人经过一次或两次试剂盒的核酸检测，结果为阳性；而在百步亭社区工作者眼中的“确诊”，只需要经过拍CT，以CT影像作为主要检测依据，多日发热，且CT影像上双肺显示有毛玻璃状或片状阴影，即可成为“确诊”。
Xu said that the current media "diagnosis" refers to the patient after one or two kits of nucleic acid test results, and in the eyes of Baebuting community workers, "diagnosis" only needs CT, CT image as the main test basis, many days of fever, and CT images of the two lungs showing hairy glass-like or lamellar shadows, can become "diagnosis.
。
.
目前这一症状在医院、社区被定义高度疑似病例。
This condition is currently defined as highly suspicious in hospitals and communities.
。
.
对于床位的问题，许志表示，很多居民质疑社区床位排位存在“猫腻”。
On the issue of beds, Xu said many residents questioned the existence of "greasy" bedspace rankings.
按照卫健委的规定，所有病人送医必须一级一级地从社区开始报备，上报街道，再到卫健委，专家核定为可收治住院的病人后，根据医院的空床位数量分配。
In accordance with the regulations of the CHP, all patients must be registered at the primary level from the community, reported to the street, then to the Wei Bodyguard Commission, approved by experts as admitted patients, allocated according to the number of hospital beds available.
“在床位非常紧缺的情况下，工作人员也没有办法。
"There is no way for the staff to do this given the acute shortage of beds.
”许志表示。
Mr Xu said.
。
.
小区内到社区居委会报备的确诊、高度疑似病例越来越多。
The number of confirmed and highly suspected cases reported to community neighbourhood committees is increasing.
经济观察报了解到，百步亭社区内的怡康苑共3779户，分为5个单元网格，截至2月4日中午12点，其中一个网格已出现至少10人确诊；在医院CT已有结果、高度疑似新冠肺炎的超30人；近10个病人要求住院，5个主动要求隔离，轻症在家达数十人。
As at 12 noon on February 4, at least 10 people in one of the 3 779 Jardine Court in the Po Puting Community had been confirmed. As at 12 noon on February 4, more than 30 people had been diagnosed with newly suspected pneumonia in the hospital CT. Nearly 10 patients required hospitalization, 5 voluntarily requested isolation, and dozens of mild cases were reported at home.
。
.
“两个在等床位，没有CT结果和核酸检测，但眼看人就快不行了。
"There are two waiting beds, no CT results and no nucleic acid tests, but I'm running out of people.
”许志表示，这种情况下，即使没有任何证明，但也会将他列入重症排队名单。
Mr Xu said that in such cases, he would be on an intensive care waiting list, even without any proof.
。
.
许志告诉经济观察报，目前各大医院床位十分紧张，每天分配到各居委会的床位名额仅有1个，但上述一个单元网格有近40名重症、高度疑似患者在排位。
Xu told the Economic Observer that hospital beds were tight, with only one bed allocated to neighborhood committees each day, but that nearly 40 patients with severe and highly suspected illnesses were on the grid.
2天前，他每天接送7-8个病人去隔离点，随着隔离点床位越来越紧缺，近日送去隔离点的病人不得不送回家中隔离，多个小区均出现床位紧缺难题。
Two days earlier, he had taken seven to eight patients daily to the quarantine site, and with the increasing shortage of beds in the isolation points, patients who had recently been sent to isolation had to be sent back to their homes and there was a shortage of beds in several small areas.
。
.
好消息是，床位紧缺问题也得到了政府高度重视。
The good news is that the shortage of beds is also high on the government's agenda.
发稿前记者获悉，排队多日的叶母终于住上了医院，但叶琪不想谈论她母亲参加“万家宴”那天时的情形。
Before sending the article, the reporter learned that many days of the mother finally live in hospital, but Ye Qi did not want to talk about her mother to attend the "million banquet" that day.
