2007-9-25 21: 48 "The temporary stoppage of European factories will have little impact on Chinese supply this season as luxury brands have phased out their offerings in the Chinese market this spring and summer.
”随着新冠肺炎疫情在欧洲大面积爆发，包括CHANEL、Hermès、Gucci在内的多家奢侈品世家纷纷被迫关闭自家位于欧洲的工厂。
With the outbreak of pneumonia in Europe, luxury families, including CHANEL, Hermès and Gucci, have been forced to close their factories in Europe.
当地时间18日，法国奢侈品牌CHANEL宣布，未来两周将关闭品牌在法国、意大利和瑞士三个国家的生产基地。
French luxury brand CHANEL announced Tuesday that it will close its production base in France, Italy and Switzerland in the next two weeks.
这些被关闭的生产基地包含了CHANEL旗下手表、高级定制服装、成衣和高级珠宝等多类产品的生产线。
The shut-down facilities include CHANEL's watches, high-end custom-made garments, garments and high-quality jewellery products.
Chanel而在意大利政府正式叫停意大利非关键性产业的一切商业活动直到4月3日后的第二天，Gucci也宣布关闭旗下六间位于意大利托斯卡尼和马尔凯地区的工厂，直至3月20日。
The day after the Italian government formally suspended all business in Italy's non-essential industries, Gucci also announced the closure of six of its factories in the Tuscany and Markey regions of Italy until March 20.
不过按照意大利目前的情况来看，Gucci工厂的停摆时间或将延长。
However, Italy's current situation, the Gucci plant may be extended the downtime.
而Hermès也在日前宣布暂时关闭法国境内42家工厂至3月底。
Hermès also announced the temporary closure of 42 factories in France until the end of March.
新冠疫情对于整个时尚行业产生巨大冲击。
The new crown epidemic has a huge impact on the fashion industry as a whole.
随着抗击新冠疫情的“战场”转移至欧美市场，奢侈品牌们在欧美市场的零售终端受到巨大冲击，其供应链上游也同时遭遇停摆。
As the battle against the New Crown has shifted to Europe and the US, luxury brands have been hit hard at retail terminals in Europe and the US, and the upper end of their supply chains has come to a halt.
这不免令人担心，已经在中国恢复营业的奢侈品牌们，是否会出现产品断供的问题。
That raises concerns about whether luxury brands, which have resumed operations in China, are going to run out of supplies.
从目前情况来看，停产暂未影响到市场的现有供货。
As things stand, the shutdown has not affected the availability of supplies on the market.
Gucci品牌在12日的停产声明中写道：“重要业务活动将会继续，暂时关闭工厂将不会影响品牌向客户供应产品。
"Important business will continue and the temporary closure of factories will not affect the supply of products to customers," Gucci said in a statement Tuesday.
”一家位于上海核心商圈的Gucci门店也向界面时尚表示，该店至少能在一周之内通过全国调足50件同款包袋。
Gucci, a Shanghai-based conglomerate, also told Interview Fashion that it could get 50 bags filled nationwide in at least a week.
被问及欧洲工厂停产是否会影响备货，该营业员表示，目前店内当季新品的备货在短期内较为充足，如果某件单品缺货，也能通过国内调货来补足。
Asked if the shutdown would affect stock availability, the salesperson said the current in-store supply of new products is more adequate in the short term, if a single item is out of stock, can also be made up through domestic transfers.
而Hermès的丝巾和包袋在中国奢侈品消费者当中向来有口皆碑。
Hermès' silk scarves and bags are well known among Chinese luxury consumers.
Hermès门店的一位销售对界面时尚表示，Hermès丝巾和皮具在中国市场的备货都有限。
Hermès has limited supplies of scarves and leather goods in the Chinese market, a sales person at Hermès said of Interface Fashion.
以Hermès的经典Clic12女士皮夹为例，单一店铺的存量有限，就算通过全国调货在一周内也较难配齐数十件。
Take Hermès' classic Women's Clic12 wallet, for example, where a single store has a limited stock and can be difficult to fill in dozens a week even through the country.
目前，各大奢侈品牌都已经陆续在中国市场上新2020春夏系列产品，但通常同一系列中的不同单品其上市时间会有个先后时间差。
At present, each major luxury brand has been in the Chinese market in the new spring and summer 2020 series products, but usually the same series of different items will have a time lag.
总体来看，由于奢侈品牌今年春夏季产品在中国市场已经逐步完成上市，其欧洲工厂的短期停摆对于中国市场当季的供货不会产生太大影响。
Overall, the short-term shutdown of luxury brands' European plants won't have much impact on Chinese supply this season, as luxury brands have already phased out their offerings in the Chinese market this spring and summer.
但欧美市场抗击新冠疫情何时结束目前还是个未知数，若抗击疫情还将持续较长一段时间，那么欧洲工厂的停摆可能会影响秋冬系列产品的生产与上新。
But it is unclear when the European and European markets will fight the end of the new crown. If the fight against the epidemic continues for a long time, then the shutdown of factories in Europe could affect the production and upgrading of autumn and winter products.
