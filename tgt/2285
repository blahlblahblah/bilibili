However, on the night of Feb. 23, Oriental disclosed a supplemental announcement of clarification, adding that the content of the notice had been corrected "due to a staff member's misrepresentation."
对此，上交所2月23日晚间向东方生物下发监管问询函，要求公司说明新冠病毒诊断系列产品在欧盟备案注册的具体进展；在国内销售是否需要取得有权部门的审批或许可；说明相关产品是否存在权属争议或潜在纠纷；如在国内销售，对当期经营和业绩的影响等问题。

此外，东方生物认为新冠病毒诊断系列产品不存在专利权纠纷。
In addition, Oriental organisms believe that there is no patent disputes for the new crown virus diagnosis products.
针对同日披露两则信息相悖的公告闹出 “乌龙”，东方生物称系因公司董秘在上传公告过程中因为时间紧迫而出现操作失误，误将非经公司审批程序之有效版本上传至公告系统，导致《澄清公告》中关于公司目前是否能在欧盟地区进行销售以及是否主要在海外地区销售等内容出现错误，相关信息未准确反映公司实际情况。
In response to the announcement of the same day to disclose two contradictory information out of "Oulong," Oriental biology said that the company secretary in the process of uploading the notice due to the urgent operation of the company due to tight operation, led to the clarification of whether the company can currently sell in the EU region and overseas sales, information does not accurately reflect the company's actual situation.
目前公司已启动内部问责机制，追究相关责任人责任。
