NBA季后赛4月中旬即将开始，以往此时球市火爆，NBA球队如今却在退票；电视转播方也损失惨重。
With the NBA playoffs due to begin in mid-April, NBA teams are now returning tickets at a time when the market is booming; television broadcasters are also losing money.
如果疫情得不到很好控制，将波及至其他体育联盟，这些体育联盟每年提供大量就业机会，并且是重要消费对象文｜《财经》记者 王晓枫 编辑｜郝洲美国职业篮球联赛（NBA）宣布，由于犹他爵士队一名球员确诊感染新冠肺炎，联盟决定从3月12日开始暂停本赛季的比赛，总裁肖华（Adam Silver）表示至少中断30天。
If the outbreak is not well controlled, it could spill over to other sports leagues, which provide plenty of jobs each year and are important consumers, announced the league's decision to suspend competition for at least 30 days starting March 12 after a Utah player was diagnosed with New Crown Pneumonia.
这是NBA历史上第六次停摆，但是首次因为传染病。
It was the sixth stoppage in NBA history, but it was the first time an epidemic.
联盟表示，NBA将利用这一空档来决定应对新冠病毒大流行的下一步行动。
The league said the NBA would use the hiatus to decide what to do next in the event of a new cap virus pandemic.
新冠疫情下， NBA赛场发生戏剧性一幕，犹他爵士队和俄克拉荷马雷霆队在开赛前几秒钟决定终止比赛。
In the new crown, a dramatic scene in the NBA, Utah Jazz and Oklahoma City decided just seconds before the start of the game.
联盟随后表示，犹他爵士队一名球员新冠病毒检测呈阳性，美国媒体随后确认这名球员为超级巨星法国人鲁迪·戈贝尔（Rudy Gobert），他成为美国体育职业联盟中首位被感染的著名球员。
The league later said a Utah Jazz player tested positive for the new crown virus, which the US media later identified as superstar Frenchman Rudy Gobert, who became the first major player to be infected with the Utah Jazz.
戈贝尔队友米切尔随后也被确诊感染。
Goebbels teammate George Mitchell was later diagnosed with the infection.
NBA的决定并非意料之外，联邦高级卫生官员安东尼·福西（Anthony Fauci）本周发出严厉警告，称新冠病毒将继续在美国传播，并表示应禁止球迷参加NBA比赛之类的大型集会。
The NBA's decision was not unexpected, with Anthony Fauci, a senior federal health official, warning harshly this week that the new crown virus would continue to spread in the United States and saying fans should be banned from attending big rallies such as NBA games.
戈贝尔确诊感染成为美国体育界的转折点，就在两队下场后不到一小时，NBA联盟叫停了本赛季的全部比赛，因为病毒传播停摆这在NBA历史上前所未有。
Goebbels diagnosis marked a turning point in American sports when, less than an hour after the two teams left, the NBA suspended all games of the season because the spread of the virus was halted as never before in NBA history.
NBA历史上曾因劳资纠纷等事件停摆五次，最近一次是在2011年。
The NBA has been suspended five times in its history, most recently in 2011, over labor disputes.
何时复赛视疫情而定对于何时恢复，总裁肖华表示，在确保所有人安全健康之前，无论是有球迷入场还是空场比赛，现在就讨论何时恢复比赛的提议还为时过早。
Depending on the outbreak, President Xiao Hua says it is too early to discuss when the game will resume before making sure everyone is safe and healthy, whether there are fans or an empty stadium.
他强调比赛至少暂停30天。
He stressed that the game should be suspended for at least 30 days.
NBA是世界上最有价值的体育联盟之一，该联盟在2018-2019赛季收入收入超过80亿美元，若受到疫情影响恐牵一动百。
The NBA is one of the world's most valuable sports leagues, with revenue of more than $8 billion for the 2018-2019 season.
截至本文发稿时，美国全国已有超过1700例确诊病例，41例死亡病例。
At the time of writing, there have been more than 1,700 confirmed cases and 41 deaths nationwide.
至少24个州已经宣布紧急状况，有消息称美国总统特朗普在考虑宣布全国进入紧急状态。
At least 24 states have declared a state of emergency, and there are reports that US President Trump is considering declaring a state of emergency.
随着疫情在美国不断升级，NBA探索各种方案来继续打比赛和转播比赛。
As the epidemic escalates in the United States, the NBA explores options for continuing to play games and broadcast games.
此前球队老板开会商议采取空场打球方式减少疫情损失，并原本计划在3月12日宣布这个解决方案，金州勇士队原本已宣布主场与篮网队的比赛将在没有观众的情况下进行，原因是旧金山政府已经禁止超过1000人的聚集活动。
The Golden State Warriors had announced that their home game against the Nets would take place without spectators, as the San Francisco government had banned more than 1,000 people from gathering.
然而，戈贝尔的阳性检测结果打乱了这一计划，联盟直接选择了更为严厉的控制措施。
However, Goebbels positive test results upset the plan, and the alliance went straight to stricter controls.
迈阿密热火队主帅埃里克·斯波尔斯特拉（Erik Spoelstra）表示非常赞同联盟的决定，因为现在的局面很严重，联盟做法出于谨慎考虑，非常明智，接下来我们还需要继续监控疫情的发展，不断进行调整。
Miami Heat manager Erik Spoelstra expressed strong support for the league's decision, given the gravity of the situation, the prudence and wisdom of the alliance's approach, and the need to continue to monitor and adapt as the epidemic unfolds.
达拉斯独行侠队老板马克·库班（Mark Cuban）在听到停赛的消息后也表示，安全比金钱更重要，信任肖决定，停摆与篮球或金钱无关。
Mark Cuban, the Dallas-based swordsman owner, also said after hearing the suspension that security was more important than money, and trusted Shaw's decision that it had nothing to do with basketball or money.
这不仅关乎NBA球队，这关乎整个国家和每个人的生活。
It's not just about NBA teams. It's about the lives of the country and everyone.
目前，NBA正在利用停摆间歇期决定应对新冠病毒大流行的下一步行动，特别是停摆带来的经济损失，NBA已经做好了因为疫情损失数亿美元的准备。
Right now, the NBA is taking advantage of the pause to decide what to do next in the event of a new cap-and-trade pandemic, especially the economic costs of a shutdown, and the NBA is ready to lose hundreds of millions of dollars due to the outbreak.
美国整个体育产业受波及NBA联盟价值在过去十年中增长近六倍，更是在今年实现NBA球队平均价值超过20亿美元。
The entire U.S. sports industry has grown nearly sixfold in value over the past decade, reaching an average NBA value of more than $2 billion this year.
据福布斯公布的NBA球队价值榜单，NBA球队平均价值达到21.2亿美元，比上赛季增长14%。
The NBA team averaged $2.12 billion, up 14% from last season, according to Forbes' list of NBA team values.
多伦多猛龙队分别以和金州勇士队分别以25%和23%位列价值增幅最大前两名球队。
The Toronto Raptors ranked the top two in terms of value increase with 25 percent and 23 percent respectively.
排名榜首的纽约尼克斯队价值高达46亿美元，排名第二的洛杉矶湖人队价值为44亿美元，第三名金州勇士队价值43亿美元。
The top New York Knicks were worth $4.6 billion, the Los Angeles Lakers, which came in second, were worth $4.4 billion, and the Golden State Warriors, worth $4.3 billion.
据福布斯数据，NBA在2018-2019赛季收入中，门票收入约占22%，与ESPN和TNT签订的电视转播合约约占收入30%，这两项收入占NBA全年收入5成左右。
According to Forbes, NBA ticket revenue is about 22% for the 2018-2019 season, and television deals with ESPN and TNT account for about 30% of revenue, accounting for about 50% of NBA revenue.
同时，NBA创下每支球队运营收入平均7000万美元的记录。
Meanwhile, the NBA has set a record of $70 million per team on average.
6支球队收入超过1亿美元，其中洛杉矶湖人队以1.78亿美元最多。
Six teams made more than $100 million, with the Los Angeles Lakers accounting for the largest $178 million.
俄克拉荷马雷霆队是唯一在运营上亏损2300万美元的球队，这因为他们球员的工资超过工资帽要支付6100万美元的奢侈税。
Oklahoma City are the only team to lose $23 million in operating costs because their players pay $61 million in luxury taxes on salaries in excess of their salary caps.
福布斯高级编辑库尔特•巴登豪森（Kurt Badenhausen）表示，尽管受到收视率下降和中国市场问题影响，但NBA特许经营价值继续飙升，上涨14%。
Kurt Baden-hausen, senior editor at Forbes, said NBA franchise value continued to soar, up 14 per cent, despite falling ratings and problems in the Chinese market.
相比之下，美国国家橄榄球联盟（NFL）球队的特许经营价值上涨11%，美国职业棒球大联盟（MLB）球队特许经营价值上涨8%。
That compares with an 11 percent increase in the franchise value of the NFL and an 8 percent increase in the value of the Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise.
新冠病毒疫情是NBA今年商业收入的黑天鹅，可以参考1998-1999赛季停摆半年带来的损失。
The New Crown Virus epidemic is the black swan of NBA business income this year, and can look to the 1998-1999 season suspension for losses.
作为NBA运营主体，包括电视转播、赞助商、特许经营产品等多个方面收入都会受到停摆带来的影响，当时联盟最终损失高达15亿美元。
As a major player in the NBA, revenues from television broadcasts, sponsors, franchises and the like are all affected by the shutdown, when the league ultimately lost as much as $1.5 billion.
除此之外，购买NBA转播权的美国三大广播公司在转播费上的损失是2亿美元。
In addition, the big three US broadcasters that bought NBA rights lost $200 million on their transmissions.
仅仅从帐面上来看，停摆32场比赛所带来的经济损失达到23亿美元。
On paper alone, the cost of stopping 32 games amounts to $2.3 billion.
这还不包括赞助商的损失，最大的球鞋赞助商在当时停摆期间股票大幅下跌。
That doesn't include the loss of sponsors, whose biggest shoe sponsor plummeted during the standstill.
NBA主要收入包括转播权、门票和特许经营产品等。
NBA revenue includes rights to broadcast, tickets and franchises.
目前NBA常规赛（共82场）还有大约五分之一剩余，季后赛将于4月18日开始，总决赛将于6月举行，届时将吸引全球数千万电视观众。
About a fifth of the 82 NBA games remain, with the playoffs set to begin on April 18 and the finals set to begin in June, drawing tens of millions of television viewers worldwide.
以往此时正值球市火爆期，NBA球队如今却在退票。
At a time when the market was booming, NBA teams were now returning tickets.
有分析根据 Statista数据库资料估算，如果NBA取消剩余常规赛或即便是空场比赛，那么每只球队将会损失至少数百万美元，特别是那些球市好的球队。
Some analysts estimate that if the NBA cancels the rest of the regular season or even an empty game, each team will lose at least several million dollars, especially those with good markets.
例如，金州勇士队损失1520万美元，纽约尼克斯队损失1287万美元，洛杉矶湖人队损失1268万美元，多伦多猛龙队损失1108万美元，波士顿凯尔特人队损失930万美元，洛杉矶快船队损失702万美元。
For example, the Golden State Warriors lost $15.2 million, the New York Knicks $12.87 million, the Los Angeles Lakers $12.68 million, the Toronto Raptors $11.08 million, the Boston Celtics $9.3 million and the Los Angeles Clippers $7.02 million.
这还仅仅是门票收入，电视转播方也损失惨重，TNT和ESPN在2014年斥资240亿美元与NBA续签了合约，合约有效期至2024-2025赛季。
This is only ticket revenue, and television broadcasters are losing money, with TNT and ESPN renewing their contracts with the NBA for $24 billion in 2014 for the 2024-2025 season.
停摆比赛给这些电视台出了难题，根本没有合适节目填补空挡，而且还要损失广告收入。
The stoppage game created problems for the stations, with no suitable programs to fill the gap and a loss of advertising revenue.
NBA节目收视率高，广告收入高达数百万美元，无论是停摆还是空场比赛都对广告收入有致命打击。
NBA shows are heavily watched and generate millions of dollars in advertising revenue, which can be fatal to advertising revenue in both stop-and-go games.
“我们与NBA有着长期的合作关系，支持采取行动保护相关人员的健康和福祉。
"We have a long-standing relationship with the NBA and we support action to protect the health and well-being of those involved.
我们将与联盟官员密切合作，在适当时候评估并决定下一步行动，”AT&T所属的特纳体育公司在一份声明中说。
We will work closely with Union officials to assess and decide on the way forward in due course, "AT & amp; T's Turner Sports Group said in a statement.
赛季停摆对于NBA赞助商也是致命打击。
The season stoppage is also a fatal blow to NBA sponsors.
NBA有复杂赞助商体系，包括统一的球衣、饮料、球队主场冠名和球衣贴标赞助商，以及与NBA官方合作转播商签约二级、三级赞助商，再加上和明星球员签约的赞助商，都将因NBA赛季停摆蒙受巨额损失。
The NBA has a complex system of sponsors, including uniform jerseys, drinks, home names and jersey stickers, as well as second- and third-tier sponsors with NBA official co-sponsors, plus sponsors who sign up for NBA season stoppages.
例如，耐克从2017年起与NBA签订8年每年4000万美元球衣赞助合同，詹姆斯、杜兰特和戴维斯等球星也是其签约对象，都将受到不同程度影响。
Nike, for example, has signed an eight-year, $40 million-a-year jersey sponsorship deal with the NBA starting in 2017, and stars such as James, Durant and Davis are among its targets and will be affected to varying degrees.
不仅是企业，在NBA庞大产业下工作的海量雇员也将面临停薪或降薪，这都是联盟需要考虑的问题。
Not just companies, but the huge number of employees working in the NBA's vast industries will also face unpaid or reduced wages, which is something the league needs to consider.
好消息是，达拉斯独行侠队老板库班已经发布视频称，将为停赛期间无法上班的员工提供经济支持。
The good news is that Dallas-based swordsman Kobain has released a video saying he will provide financial support to employees who are unable to report to work during the suspension.
NBA停摆可能给美国体育界带来多米诺骨牌效应。
The NBA stoppage could have a domino effect on American sports.
就在NBA做出停摆决定几个小时前，美国全国大学体育协会（NCAA）锦标赛宣布“疯狂三月”（March Madness）比赛将在没有球迷现场观看情况下进行。
Hours before the NBA's decision to halt, the National College Sports Association (NCAA) championship announced that the March Madness tournament would be held without fans watching.
NFL和MLB尚未采取任何行动，但美国国家冰球联盟（NHL）紧随NBA之后宣布无限停赛，恢复时间待定。
The NFL and MLB have yet to take any action, but the NHL announced an indefinite suspension immediately after the NBA, with recovery times to be determined.
NHL称联盟球队和NBA球队曾共用过很多设施和更衣室，这是他们做出停赛的主要原因，因为NHL一些成员也有可能在某个时候的检测中呈阳性，现在再也不适合继续比赛了。
The NHL said the league and NBA teams used to share many facilities and dressing rooms, which was the main reason for their suspensions, because some members of the NHL may have tested positive at some point and are no longer fit to continue playing.
可以肯定的是如果疫情得不到很好控制，将波及至其他体育联盟，这些体育联盟每年提供大量就业机会，并且是重要消费对象。
To be sure, if the epidemic is not well controlled, it will spill over to other sports federations, which provide a large number of jobs each year and are important consumers.
2010年全美体育产业总产值就高达4410亿美元，相当于美国3% 的GDP，如果产生连锁反应，经济损失不可估量。
In 2010, the total value of the nation's sports industry was $441 billion, equivalent to 3% of GDP in the United States.
