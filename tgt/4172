“ 上海将对所有来自非重点国家和地区的入境来沪人员实施100%新冠病毒核酸检测。
"Shanghai will conduct 100 percent Nucleic Acid (Nucleic Acid) testing of all incoming migrants from non-priority countries and regions.
”3月22日，上海举行第57场市疫情防控工作发布会，上海市卫健委表示，上海已经对所有来自或途经重点国家和地区的入境来沪人员实行100%隔离。
Shanghai has imposed 100 percent quarantine on all incoming residents from or through key countries and regions, the Shanghai Health Commission said at a press conference on March 22.
为了进一步加强口岸防控，除集中隔离人员外，上海将对所有来自非重点国家和地区的入境来沪人员实施100%新冠病毒核酸检测。
In order to further strengthen the control of ports, in addition to centralized quarantine personnel, Shanghai will be from all non-key countries and regions of entry into Shanghai to implement 100% of the new crown virus nucleic acid test.
上海市民政局副局长曾群表示，“外防输入”是当前上海疫情防控的重中之重，社区落实居家隔离措施要从严从紧。
Zeng Qun, deputy director of the Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau, said that "external defense input" was the top priority for prevention and control of the epidemic in Shanghai.
自1月24日起，上海就启动了重点地区来沪人员的居家隔离工作。
Since January 24, Shanghai has launched a key area to Shanghai personnel to work in isolation at home.
社区落实居家隔离措施，对中外人士是一视同仁的。
The community implements the home isolation measure, treats the Chinese and foreign personage equally.
截至目前，全市居家隔离人员中，凡出现发热等症状的，均在第一时间被转送至指定医疗机构发热门诊。
So far, the city's home isolation personnel, any fever and other symptoms, are the first time to be transferred to designated medical facilities fever clinic.
从近两个月的实践来看，上海居家隔离工作开展有序有效，充分发挥了在疫情防控中的网底作用。
Judging from the practice of the past two months, the work of home isolation in Shanghai has been carried out in an orderly and effective manner.
在当前，更需要继续坚持，进一步严格落实。
At present, it is even more necessary to persevere and further strictly implement them.
曾群再次强调，居家隔离必须符合“一人一户或一家”的居住条件，也就是居家隔离对象和非居家隔离对象不可以住在同一套房子里。
Once again, Mr Tsang stressed that residential segregation must be "one person, one household or one family," meaning that no one should live in the same house as those who are not.
承诺全家人一起居家隔离的，或全家人都需要居家隔离的，才可以住在同一套房子里。
A family can live in the same house only if they promise to keep the family together, or if the whole family needs to be separated at home.
对此，相关社区必须上门核查。
In this regard, the communities concerned must conduct home checks.
条件不具备的，一律实行集中隔离。
Where conditions do not exist, centralized segregation shall be practiced.
二是需要居家隔离的重点国家入境人员，必须在各区“临时集中留验点”先通过核酸测试，也就是结果必须为“阴性”。
The other is that people from key countries who need to be segregated must first pass a nucleic acid test in each district, meaning the result must be negative.
三是严格落实针对居家隔离的社区管理。
Third, strictly implement the community management of residential isolation.
地区公安、卫健部门要会同社区，确保居家隔离人员不离开住所。
District public security and health departments should work with the community to ensure that isolated persons do not leave their homes.
对擅自离开的，依法处理。
Whoever leaves without permission shall be handled according to law.
曾群最后说，为确保相关工作切实落地，上海还明确要求居村委会要进一步加强重点国家入境人员返回小区时的信息登记和排摸等工作，做到全覆盖、无遗漏。
In order to ensure that the relevant work is carried out on the ground, Shanghai has also explicitly asked the residents' committees to further strengthen the registration and arrangement of information when people from key countries return to their communities, so as to achieve full coverage and non-exhaustive coverage, Zeng said.
居村委会要协助社区卫生服务中心落实医学监测，落实疫情防控发热筛查“零报告”制度。
