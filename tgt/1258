一天接送一个医护人员可以节省4个小时，接送100个就是400小时，400个小时，医护人员能救多少人，怎么算我都是赚的。
It takes four hours a day to get a paramedics, 400 hours to get 100, 400 hours, how many people the paramedics can save, how much I earn.
口述 |汪　勇整理 |吴　雪我是个快递员，也是个“组局”的人。
At the request of AT & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45
2月13日凌晨5点，我在武汉二环外快递仓库的一个高低床上醒来，这个仓库有些特殊，恰好建在下水管道口，潮湿阴冷，我拿起体温计，测了下体温，不超过36度。
Feb. 13, at 5 a.m., I woke up in a high and low bed outside the Wuhan Second Ring Express Warehouse, some special, just built at the sewer entrance, damp and cold, I picked up the thermometer, took the temperature of the temperature, not more than 36 degrees.
出门前看了下手机日历，原来，我已经22天没回家了。
I looked at the phone calendar before I left. It turned out that I hadn't been home for 22 days.
“战疫”这些天，汪勇一直住在公司仓库我是汪勇，生长于武汉，是一名普通的80后快递小哥，从早到晚，送快递、打包、发快递、搬货，日复一日的拼搏，够得上一家三口开销。
"Battle Disease" these days, Wang Yong has been living in the company warehouse I am Wang Yong, grew up in Wuhan, is an ordinary post-80 courier brother, from morning to night, delivery, packaging, express delivery, moving goods, day after day struggle, enough to meet the expenses of a family of three.
每天一睁眼就投入到战斗中的我，像一个上了发条的“陀螺”。
Every day as soon as I open my eyes into the battle I, like a wound "top."
2月初，陆续有记者找到我跟踪采访，从没想过在这场疫情中，会成为新闻人物。
In early February, reporters came to me to follow the interview, never thought in this epidemic, will become a news person.
送护士回家，她哭了一路事情要从大年三十说起，因为疫情的影响，快递公司放假了。
Send the nurse home, she cried all the way from the beginning of the New Year's Eve, because of the impact of the epidemic, express company holiday.
傍晚，我关好仓库返回家中与亲人吃团圆饭。
In the evening, I closed the warehouse and returned home to eat reunion dinner with my relatives.
晚上10点，打算哄女儿休息时，突然刷到一名来自武汉金银潭医院护士的朋友圈，对方写道：“求助，我们这里限行了，没有公交车和地铁，回不了家，走回去要四个小时。
At 10 p.m., intending to coax her daughter to rest, she suddenly brushed into a circle of friends from a nurse at Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital. She wrote, "Help, we have restrictions here, no buses and subways, can't go home, it takes four hours to walk back.
”需求是6点钟发布的，一直没人接单。
The demand was announced at six o'clock, and no one answered.
穿戴防护服的汪勇“去还是不去”当时我很纠结，但又很想去做这个事情。
Wang Yong, wearing protective clothing "go or not" at the time I was very tangled, but would like to do this thing.
我没敢告诉家人，自己一个人默默地花了一个小时做心理斗争。
I didn't dare to tell my family that I had spent a quiet hour alone fighting psychologically.
最后下定决心“去”。
Finally he decided to go.
老婆是个心理脆弱的人，没经历过什么大事；父母又上了年纪，不能让他们担心。
His wife was a frail person who had not experienced any great events; her parents were too old to worry them.
所以，我决定一个人扛下这件事情——用善意的谎言瞒着他们。
So I decided to carry the matter alone - to hide it from them with white lies.
第一个问题是怎么出去？发单的护士是第二天早上六点钟下夜班，我告诉老婆说，网点临时需要值班人员，我被派去值班了，顺利瞒了过去。
I told my wife that there was a temporary duty at the branch office and that I had been sent on duty and had managed to keep it a secret.
当时手里没有任何防护用具，就先去超市买了两只N95的口罩，六点钟准时到达金银潭医院。
Without any protective gear in hand, I went to the supermarket to buy two N95 masks and arrived at the Golden and Silver Pool Hospital on time at six o'clock.
护士看到我愣了一下：“我没想到有人会接这个单。
"The nurse looked at me blankly." I didn't expect anyone to take the slip.
”接着，她上车，一路上一言不发，默默抽泣，一直哭到下车。
"Then she got into the car, sobbing silently and silently, until she got out.
第一天我接送了接近三十个医护人员往返金银潭医院，一天下来，腿抖个不停。
On the first day I took nearly 30 paramedics to and from the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital. At the end of the day my legs shook.
说实话，我心里很害怕，万一感染了怎么办。
To tell you the truth, I'm afraid of what to do if I get infected.
我开始打退堂鼓劝自己说：“要不算了吧。
I began to pull myself out of the way and exhort myself, "Why not?
”但当我看到晚上有护士发单，目的地距离医院有几十公里那么远，没有一个人接。
But when I saw a nurse issue the ticket at night and the destination was dozens of kilometers away from the hospital, no one answered.
突然又改变了主意。
Suddenly he changed his mind.
我又编了第二个“谎言”，告诉老婆说，自己接触了疑似病患，害怕被感染，只能先睡在快递仓库暂时隔离7天，没问题才能回家。
I made up a second "lie", told his wife that he had contact with suspected patients, afraid of infection, can only sleep in the express warehouse temporarily isolated for seven days, no problem to go home.
开始老婆不听我解释，哭得稀里哗啦，后来情绪稳定后，才算同意。
At first my wife didn't listen to me, she cried loudly. Then she was in a stable mood before she agreed.
而慢慢的，和医护人员接触多了，我开始明白她们为什么轮休的时候，宁愿走路也要回趟家。
Gradually, as I got in touch with the paramedics, I began to understand why they would rather walk home than go home.
事实上，在全国医疗救援队来之前的一个星期，金银潭医护人员都是连夜奋战，能睡到床的人有10%，剩下的都是靠椅；病人的呻吟声、对讲机24小时呼叫，持续待在这样的氛围里，任何人精神上都难以承受，更别提好好休息了。
In fact, during the week preceding the arrival of the national medical team, Gold and Silver Pool medical staff had fought all night long, with 10 per cent of people sleeping in bed and the rest being armchairs; the groans of patients and 24-hour calls on walkie-talkies were in such an atmosphere that no one could bear it, let alone have a good rest.
所以，即便在路上走4个小时，对她们来说，也是短暂的休息。
So even a four-hour walk on the road is a short break for them.
医护人员在靠椅上短暂小憩医护人员在靠椅上短暂小憩大年初四，支援武汉的医疗队越来越多，像给他们打了一剂“强心针”。
Medical staff took a brief nap on their chairs. More and more medical teams supported Wuhan at the beginning of the year, giving them a powerful shot.
那天，我本来要接一名医生上班，就突然接到了她的电话：“师傅，你不用来接我了，我今天可以轮休了。
That day, when I was about to take a doctor to work, I suddenly got a call from her. "Shifu, you're not coming to pick me up.
” 当时我很开心，我建的医护服务群，进的人也越来越多，我开始发觉自己就算再拼命，也只能满足接送每天300公里的量。
I was very happy at the time, and as the number of people entering my healthcare network grew, I began to realize that I could only meet the 300-kilometer-a-day capacity I needed to go any further.
招募志愿者一起接送医护人员于是，我开始在朋友圈发布消息招募志愿者，硬性要求：必须一个人住，必须佩戴防护用具。
So I started posting messages in my circle of friends asking for volunteers. It was mandatory to live alone and wear protective gear.
如果答案否定，我就拒绝他们。
If the answer is no, I will reject them.
接下来有二三十个人轮流跟着我跑，中间我们跑坏了三台车，后来，六台车基本可以满足需求。
The next twenty or thirty people took turns running after me, and in the middle we broke down three cars, and then six cars were nearly enough to meet the demand.
但仍然不是长久之计，有人提议可以寻找资源。
However, it was still not a long-term solution, and it was suggested that resources could be found.
我们先是联系上了摩拜单车，他们的投放效率很快，医院、酒店所有的点位，车辆人员一天到位，解决了2公里左右的出行需求；紧接着对接滴滴，因为大公司流程繁琐，耗时很长，一个星期才算搞定。
We first contacted the Moby Bicycle, their efficient delivery, all the places in the hospital and the hotel, and the arrival of vehicles in one day to meet the demand for about 2 kilometers of travel; then the docking drip, because the big companies' procedures are cumbersome, take a long time, a week to complete.
为了配合到三环以外金银潭医院医护人员的出行需求，滴滴把接单公里数从3.5公里以内直接更改为15公里以内。
In order to meet the travel needs of the medical staff of the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital outside the Third Ring Road, the number of kilometres per day was changed directly from 3.5 km to less than 15 km.
青桔单车在盘龙桥上设置服务点青桔单车也是三天内对接完毕，投放了400台，从运维、费用、投放，专门有个团队管理，一下子彻底解决了出行问题。
Citrus bicycles set up service points on the Panglong Bridge were docked in three days, and 400 units were put into operation, cost and delivery, with a special team in charge, which solved the travel problem once and for all.
那些天，每天晚上，我都要抽出1个小时，和家人视频演戏，朋友圈发布招募和求助信息不敢对家人公开，但随着出境次数的增多，任务越来越忙，这件事再也瞒不住了。
I spent an hour every night playing video games with my family and posting recruitment and help messages to my family, but as the number of departures grew and the task became more and more busy, the matter could no longer be kept secret.
老婆知道后很慌，我做了思想工作，最后还是表示支持理解。
The wife after knowing very panic, I did ideological work, finally expressed support for understanding.
只是我两岁的女儿很黏我，一到晚上就吵着跟爸爸睡，找不到就坐在角落里哭。
Only my two-year-old daughter is sticky enough for me to sleep with my father all night and sit in the corner crying if I can't find her.
元宵节那天，看着她趴在我照片上亲了又亲的视频，心里特别愧疚，很想家人。
Lantern Festival that day, watching her flat on my photo kiss and kiss video, in the heart of special guilt, miss family.
但我明白自己不能停下脚步，驰援武汉的医疗队是我们的“救命恩人”，政府给他们安排得有饭吃、有地儿住，但细枝末节不一定照顾得到，我们可以查漏补缺，尽我所能不亏待他们。
But I know that I can not stop to help Wuhan medical team is our "lifesaver," the government arranged for them to have food, shelter, but the details may not take care of, we can leak out, do my best to treat them.
汪勇一家人Play汪勇的女儿看到爸爸照片亲又亲想吃米饭，我们搞定了一家餐厅最开始我们募集到了2.2万元，为倒夜班的医护提供泡面和水。
When Wang Yong's daughter saw her father's picture and wanted rice, we managed a restaurant where we collected 22,000 yuan to provide noodles and water for night-shift medical workers.
后来有一个护士发朋友圈说，好想吃大米饭，我看到后心酸得不行，下定决心第二天一定让她们吃上白米饭，很快就有餐馆老板对接了，16块钱一份，一天100多份。
Then one of the nurses in the group said that I wanted rice so much that I felt very sad when I saw it. I decided to let them have white rice the next day. Soon the owner of the restaurant docked, 16 yuan a piece, more than 100 yuan a day.
第二天，武汉一家酒楼老板找到我说，可以免费提供盒饭，一天1500份，分别提供给金银潭医院、新华医院和协和医院。
The next day, the owner of an Wuhan restaurant came to me and said that 1,500 boxed meals a day could be provided free of charge to Gold and Silver Pool Hospital, Xinhua Hospital and Concorde Hospital respectively.
就餐问题解决了，但我又发现另一个新情况：对接餐馆的负荷太大了，产能也已经到顶。
The dining problem was solved, but I found another development: the load on the restaurant was too high and capacity had peaked.
我开始设想，在现有许多资源倾斜的情况下，我们能不能有一家专门的供餐餐厅。
I began to wonder if we could have a special catering restaurant with many of the resources available.
我很快开始落地实施，一天跑20多家餐厅谈合作，一家家地问能不能免费或低价给我们用场地和员工，很快，金滏山餐厅的老板，与我们目标一致，一拍即合。
I soon began to fall into the ground, running more than 20 restaurants a day to talk about cooperation, each asking whether we can use free or low-cost venues and staff, soon, Fushan restaurant owners, and we are in harmony.
金滏山餐厅开始免费供餐2月5日，金滏山餐厅开始供餐，两荤一素，很快满足了金银潭医院的就餐问题。
Fushan restaurant began free meal February 5, Fushan restaurant began to meal, two meat one element, quickly satisfied the gold and silver pool hospital dining problems.
剩余的产量，每天供应给滴滴司机240份，既然别人是来帮助我们的，我们就不该再把风险嫁接给别人。
The rest, supplied to the drip drivers in 240 copies a day, should not be passed on to others since others are here to help us.
可惜的是，2月7日，武汉当地的食品安全部门登门查封了这家餐厅，要求停止营业。
Unfortunately, on February 7, local food security authorities in Wuhan closed the restaurant and demanded that it be closed.
原因是在疫情关键期，只允许几家指定单位生产供餐，且该资质目前无法申请。
This is due to the fact that only a few designated units are allowed to produce meals during the critical period of the epidemic, and the qualification is currently not available.
沟通一天未果，无奈之下，我们联系了几家定点供餐单位，发现对方说一份盒饭成本价40元，我们募集的资金根本负担不起。
After a day of unsuccessful communication, we contacted several designated feeding units and found that the other party said a box meal cost 40 yuan, we could not afford the funds raised.
我当时挫败感很强，但随后事情又开始出现转机。
I was frustrated, but then things began to turn around again.
武汉一家本地企业“Today便利店”解决了用餐问题：每天提供金银潭医院所有支援团队的用餐，以及每天支持滴滴车主免费午餐300份。
A local Wuhan company, Today Convenience Shop, solved the dining problem by providing daily meals for all the support groups at the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital and supporting 300 drip-drip free lunches per day.
那天，我终于松了一口气。
I finally breathed a sigh of relief that day.
Today便利店提供给医护人员的物资Today便利店提供的免费盒饭我没有任何资源，但一呼百应我是一个没有任何资源的人，但一路走来，特别感谢追随的志愿者和大企业的帮助。
Today Convenience Shop Supplies Today Convenience Store Free Boxes I don't have any resources, but I'm a resource-starved person, but along the way, especially with the help of follow-up volunteers and big business.
大家都在为这个事情努力，我只是一个组局的人。
Everybody's working on this. I'm just a bureau guy.
出行、用餐——每组一个局，我就交给一个人管理，再腾出手来做其他事情。
Travel, eat - each group of a bureau, I handed over to a person to manage, then free hand to do other things.
因为平日里和医护人员接触的多，他们的现状我最了解，生活上的支援也是必不可少。
Because of the daily contact with medical staff, their current situation I know best, life support is also indispensable.
比如，眼镜片坏了，手机屏碎了，需要买拖鞋、指甲钳、充电器甚至秋衣秋裤，在群里通过接龙喊一声，很快就有专人采购，帮他们搞定。
For example, glasses broken, cell phone screen broken, need to buy slippers, nail clippers, chargers and even autumn clothes autumn pants, through the group yell, soon someone to do the procurement, to help them.
记得有一次，上海医疗队的两名医生过生日，我们帮他们买了蛋糕，过了一个难忘的生日；还有一次，因为医院里空调不能开，医护最缺的是用来保暖的无袖羽绒服，我们把商超的羽绒服买得一件不剩，又在广州定了1000件优衣库。
I remember the birthday of two doctors from Shanghai Medical Team, we bought cakes for them and had an unforgettable birthday. Another time, because the air conditioner in the hospital could not be turned on, the sleeveless feather suit used to keep warm was the most missing.
志愿者理发师甘师傅，已经出勤5场，好评如潮汪勇在群里对接服务安徽援助武汉重症护理组汪勇组织志愿者为上海医疗队购买庆生蛋糕印象最深的一件事是，医护人员需要一批防护鞋套，整个武汉市都断货，后来在淘宝线上找到一个商家有货，但在距离武汉市区55公里的鄂州葛店，因为商家也是一名新冠肺炎确诊患者，发不了快递。
volunteer barber Ge Den has attended 5 sessions and received high praise for docking service in the group. Anhui assistance to Wuhan intensive care group Wang Yong volunteers for the Shanghai medical team one of the most impressive thing is that the medical staff need a batch of protective shoes, later found in Taobao line there are goods, but 55 kilometers away from Wuhan City District Huizhou Ge dian, because business is also a confirmed patients of new crown pneumonia, express delivery.
我连夜开车去取，带回来了2000双。
I drove all night to pick it up and brought back 2,000 pairs.
我每天不停地做事，不停地解决问题，我不知道自己什么时候停下，但只要医护人员呼唤我，我随时都在。
I keep doing things and solving problems every day. I don't know when I'm going to stop, but as soon as the paramedics call, I'm always there.
截至目前，我们一共对接了1000名医护人员，接下来还要对接3000名驰援武汉的医疗队。
So far, we have docked a total of 1000 medical personnel, and then have to dock 3000 medical teams to help Wuhan.
2月2日，汪勇发布朋友圈写道：这么多天我扛住了，但护士的一句关心让我泪流不止人这一辈子碰不到这么大的事情，不管做什么，尽全力做，不后悔。
On February 2, Wang Yong issued a circle of friends wrote: So many days I carried, but a nurse's care let me tears more than people in this lifetime encountered such a big thing, no matter what, do do, do not regret.
其实想想，我开始做这件事的初衷很简单，一天接送一个医护人员可以节省4个小时，接送100个就是400小时，400个小时，医护人员能救多少人，怎么算我都是赚的。
In fact, I started this with the simple intention of saving four hours a day carrying a paramedic, 400 hours for 100 trips, 400 hours for paramedics, how many people I could save, how much I earned.
2月13日晚，妈妈的朋友看到了我的视频，电话告知了妈妈，对我表示极大的支持。
Feb. 13 night, my mother's friends saw my video, phone told my mother, I expressed great support.
在亲戚朋友眼中，我从小都不是省心的小孩，直到现在父母还在为我操心，帮我带孩子，补贴我的家用，还好，这次办的事儿没给你们丢脸。
In the eyes of relatives and friends, I have not been a worry-free child, until now parents are still worried about me, help me raise children, subsidize my family, Fortunately, this time the matter did not humiliate you.
