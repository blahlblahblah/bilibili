澎湃新闻记者 汪伦宇截至3月9日，意大利新冠肺炎确诊病例累计达到9172例，累计死亡463例。
As of March 9, the total number of confirmed cases of pneumonia in Italy reached 9,172, a cumulative total of 463 deaths.
为遏制新冠病毒的传播，意大利总理孔特3月9日晚发表电视讲话宣布，自10日起在全国范围内实施封城，意大利6000多万人口将都将受到影响。
Italy's more than 60 million people will be affected by a nationwide blockade of the city from Monday night, Prime Minister Igor Conte said on Thursday.
自10日起，包括意甲联赛在内的全国所有体育赛事都将暂停，以及学校停课时间从原来的3月15日延长到4月3日等。
All sporting events in the country, including Serie A, will be suspended from 10 days, and school hours will be extended from 15 March to 3 April.
孔特表示，意大利政府认为这是必须采取的严厉措施，以避免新冠肺炎疫情在全国范围内进一步扩散。
Conte said the Italian government believes this is a drastic measure that must be taken to prevent a further spread of the outbreak nationwide.
在此前一天，意大利已先行封锁了该国北部的伦巴第大区和11个邻近省份，1600万人口流动受到影响。
The day before, Italy had blocked the Lombardy region and 11 neighbouring provinces in the north of the country, affecting 16 million people.
在8日凌晨2点的新闻发布会上，孔特宣布抑制新冠肺炎疫情扩散的法令已正式生效。
At a 2: 00 a.m. news conference on the 8th, Conte announced that the decree to curb the spread of pneumonia in the New Crown had entered into force.
孔特宣布的封锁范围涉及意大利最重要的经济中心伦巴第、威尼托、艾米利亚-罗马涅大区的绝大部分地区，它们被列为疫情严重的“红区”。
The embargo announced by Conte covers most of Italy's most important economic centres, Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia Romagna, which are classified as "red zones" with severe epidemics.
意大利的金融和时尚中心米兰、旅游胜地威尼斯均在“红区”内。
Italy's financial and fashion center Milan, the resort of Venice are in the "red zone."
距离米兰不远的小城贝加莫，也在首批“封城”的区域之内。
The small city of Bergamo, not far from Milan, was also among the first "closed" areas.
作为贝加莫市长幕僚长，来自在野党民主党的桑切斯9日告诉澎湃新闻（www.thepaper.cn），贝加莫当地的商业和旅游业已经遭受重创。
Bergamo mayor chief of staff, from the opposition Democratic Party Sanchez told the surging news (www.thepper.cn), Bergamo local business and tourism has been hit hard.
“本地旅游业遭受的打击是灾难性的。
"The impact on the local tourism industry has been devastating.
”桑切斯说，“米兰名气最大，但实际上并不是感染最严重的城市。
"Milan is the most famous, but it's not really the most affected city," he said.
像贝加莫这样的周边小城在疫情暴发第一周就被封锁了，经济上的灾难式后果也是从我们这先开始。
Small neighbouring cities like Bergamo were sealed off in the first week of the outbreak, and the disastrous economic consequences began with us.
”“在保持‘封城’的同时，意大利政府采取了一些措施来缓解贝加莫当地经济的损失，比如减免企业税收。
"" While keeping the city closed, the Italian government has taken steps to cushion the damage to Bergamo's local economy, such as tax breaks for businesses.
但远水难解近渴，短期内的经济萎缩很难避免。
But distant waters do not quench thirst, and near-term economic contraction is hard to avoid.
”他补充道。
'he added.
米兰人利用时间窗口逃离意大利政府的“封城”令发出后，社交媒体上迅速出现大量米兰人“大逃离”的照片和视频。
After Milan used the time window to escape the Italian government's "Seal of the City" order, there was a rapid flood of images and videos of the "exodus" of Milan on social media.
而“封城”令也确实为“逃离”留下了时间窗口。
And the "closure" order did leave a window of time for "escape."
法国bfm电视台据意大利媒体报道，孔特政府宣布“封城”决定的具体时间为当地时间7日晚8时40分，而正式生效的时间为8日零点。
According to Italian media reports, Conte's government announced that the decision to "seal the city" is 8: 40 p.m. local time, but the effective time is 8: 40 pm.
如此一来，不少人利用这三个小时的时间差离开米兰。
As a result, many people took advantage of the three-hour gap to leave Milan.
法国媒体BFMTV的现场直播显示，一些意大利人拖着行李箱，一路小跑至火车站台，希望能赶上11点40分的末班车。
A live broadcast by the French media BFMTV shows Italians shuffling through suitcases as they trot to the train station in hopes of catching the last bus at 11.40.
据意媒安莎社报道，很多赶车的乘客甚至都没有买票，其中部分人告诉检票员，即使罚款也要登车离开。
According to the Italian news agency Ansa, many drivers didn't even buy tickets, and some of them told ticket inspectors to board and leave even if fined.

据意大利媒体报道，除了坐火车，还有不少人7日晚自驾或坐大巴离开。
According to Italian media reports, in addition to the train, but also a number of people on the night of 7 or left by bus.
按照意大利政府的规定，如果能证明有紧急情况、特殊健康问题等，可以在获得准许后离开“红区”。
According to the Italian Government, permission to leave the "red zone" may be granted if it can be proved that there is an emergency, special health problems, etc.

If I don't leave early, I may have to stay at home indefinitely.
”意大利的新冠肺炎死亡率虽高（9日达到4.96%），但死者中老年人占了绝大部分（截至4日死亡的105人均为50岁以上），因此年轻人对封锁城市的担心远大于疫情本身。
Italy has a high death rate from pneumonia (4.96 percent on the 9th), but older people account for the vast majority of deaths (105 deaths as of the 4th day are over 50 years old), so young people are far more concerned about blockading the city than the epidemic itself.

”不过，意大利的“封城”举措并非彻底关闭城市进出，也不是所有公共场所都必须关闭。
