作者 | 闫丽娇编辑 | 周昶帆2月9日，大V最终决定去参加在日本东京举办的Wonder Festival（WF）手办模型展。
At the end of February, Big V finally decided to participate in a Wunder Festival (WF) hand-held model exhibition in Tokyo, Japan.
他一个人拖着一行李箱的玩具，没有让同事一起去，也几乎没有带宣传物料。
He dragged a suitcase full of toys, didn't ask his co-workers to go with him, and hardly took promotional materials with him.
在东京参展的人，70%都戴上了口罩。
In Tokyo, 70% of the exhibitors wore masks.
截至2月8日，日本新冠肺炎确诊达到89例，也成为了中国以外疫情比较严重的国家之一。
As of February 8, 89 cases of pneumonia were diagnosed in Japan, making it one of the countries outside China with a serious epidemic.
而WF是世界上规模最大的手办模型展，距今已经有36年历史，它是玩具创作者和爱好者每年必须要参加的展会。
The WF, the world's largest hand-held model show, is 36 years old and must be attended by toy creators and enthusiasts every year.
这也是大V冒着疫情风险不得不去东京参展的原因之一。
That's one reason why Big V has to go to Tokyo at the risk of an epidemic.
大V在WF订了3个展位，原计划是一行十几个人，除了玩具以外，他们还准备了周边及设计师手绘明信片。
Big V booked three booths at the WF, originally planned for a dozen people who, in addition to the toys, had prepared hand-painted postcards for the perimeter and the designer.
明信片已经设计完成，但因为找不到打印厂，连同周边和宣传物料都没有制作出来。
The postcard had been designed, but as the printing plant could not be found, neither the perimeter nor the publicity materials were produced.
尽管大V去参了展，但最终效果可想而知，并不怎么理想。
Although the big V went to the exhibition, but the final results can be imagined, not ideal.
突如其来的疫情让国内很多展会取消或延期，而那些依然举办的各类国际展会，因中国参展商的缺席也受到了极大影响。
The sudden outbreak has caused many exhibitions in China to be cancelled or postponed, while the absence of Chinese exhibitors has also greatly affected those international exhibitions that are still being held.
去年8月的北京潮玩展（BTS），有的粉丝甚至一大早5点就过来排队。
At last August's Beijing Tide Show (BTS), some fans even came in line at 5am.
而今年上半年，国内应该不会再看到这类景象了。
And in the first half of this year, the country should not see such a scene again.
2月25日，原定4月举办的上海WF宣布延期至国庆假期，退票通道已经开启。
February 25, the Shanghai WF scheduled to be held in April announced the extension of the National Day holiday, the refund channel has been opened.
另外，今年上半年还有两个比较大的国际性玩具展——泰国Thalland Toy Expo玩具展（TTE）和2020上海国际潮流玩具展（STS）。
In addition, there were two major international toy exhibitions in the first half of this year - the Thalland Toy Expo Toy Show (TTE) in Thailand and the Shanghai International Tide Toy Show (STS) 2020.
上海STS宣布延期至6月，泰国TTE目前还未推迟。
STS in Shanghai has announced an extension until June, and TTE in Thailand has not yet postponed.
但参展的设计师们也会担心安全问题。
But exhibitors will also worry about safety.
对参展方来说，能不能顺利参加，不仅取决于目的地的疫情状况，还取决于国内工厂的复工程度。
For exhibitors, successful participation depends not only on the epidemiological situation of the destination, but also on the degree of reactivation of domestic factories.
如果工厂把产品按期生产出来，展会又不延迟，大V他们至少还能赶得上。
If the factory produces the product on schedule and the exhibition is not delayed, they can at least catch up with the big V.
这次疫情给潮玩行业带来了一系列影响。
The epidemic has had a series of effects on the boomer gaming industry.
短时间内是相关商家的现金流压力，紧接着产生了连锁反应。
A short period of time is related to the cash flow pressure, followed by a chain reaction.
对于潮玩行业，尤其是对独立设计师来说，展会销售在销售中占了很大一部分。
For the tide game industry, especially for independent designers, exhibition sales account for a large part of sales.
潮玩设计师通过展会精准获客，将潜在买家拉入微信群，再通过社群方式售卖后续产品。
Tide designers through the exhibition precise visitors, will be drawn into the micro-group of potential buyers, and through community selling follow-up products.
而现在，展会没有了，就意味着重要的源头被切断了。
And now that the show is gone, it means that important sources have been cut off.
再加上制造工厂停工、涂装工厂停工，从产品生产到销售，所有的环节都是一环扣一环，每一环节都受到影响，对潮玩设计师来说，其实几乎是切断了所有的路。
Coupled with manufacturing plant shutdown, painting plant shutdown, from product production to sales, all the links are linked, every link is affected, to the tide designers, virtually cut off all the way.
潮玩生意对大V来说，他也可以选择不去参展。
For Big V, he can also opt out of the show.
不去就意味着前期投入的展位费、搭建费和玩具销售额等等就损失掉了。
Failure to do so would mean a loss of booth fees, erection fees, toy sales, etc.
当然，这是能估算出来的，而新合作等算不出来的潜在损失，更加重了他的压力。
Of course, this can be estimated, and new cooperation, such as the potential losses, added to his pressure.
在评估过风险后，他决定自己一个人去。
After assessing the risks, he decided to go alone.
JumpWorks（玩物复苏）在日本WF的参展作品大V是玩具圈里一个典型地把爱好变成职业的人，1985年出生的他是个资深玩具迷，以前他有一份药企工作，和玩具完全不沾边。
JumpWorks (Resuscitation) at Japan's WF Big V is a typical hobbyist in toy circles. Born in 1985, he was a veteran toy addict who used to work for a pharmaceutical company and was completely out of touch with toys.
在成长的过程中，一些动漫和玩具深深影响了他。
In the process of growing up, some animation and toys deeply affected him.
1989年，变形金刚开始在北京电视台播出。
In 1989, Transformers began broadcasting on Beijing TV.
其后，周边玩具在京大卖。
Later toys were sold at Peking University.
1990年，日本漫画家井上雄彦的知名漫画《灌篮高手》开始连载。
In 1990, Japanese cartoonist Haruhiko Inoue's famous comic book, "Flaming Master," began running.
对于85后、90后这一代人，日漫IP衍生的玩具周边陪伴了他们的年少时代。
For the post-85 and post-90-year-old generation, the IP-derived toy periphery accompanies their teenage years.
“基本是从初中开始，适合当时年龄段的玩具就很少了。
"Basically, from junior high, there were very few toys for that age group.
最多是拼装玩具，还能让人觉得难度高点。
The most is to assemble toys, but also to make people feel difficult high.
从小学跳到大学，甚至上班以后，玩玩具中间有个断档期。
From elementary school to college, even after work, there is a break between playing toys.
那段空白期，男生们都在忙着打篮球、上网吧。
That gap period, boys are busy playing basketball, Internet cafes.
”大V回忆。
"Big V recalls.
那段时间，有收藏意识的人还能留下几件玩具，大部分玩具干脆被家长直接扔掉。
There were also a few toys left by collectors, most of which were simply thrown away by parents.
工作以后，他们再想回过头找到这些东西时，能存下来的就非常少了。
When they work, and they want to look back and find these things, there's very little left.
一代人成长起来，能够买得起小时候买不起的玩具，除了收藏爱好外，也不排除报复性消费，弥补那些曾经被家长扔掉玩具的自尊心。
A generation has grown up able to afford toys it could not afford as a child and, in addition to hobbies, did not rule out vindictive spending to compensate for the pride of those who had been thrown out of toys by their parents.
小时候有的，长大了得有，小时候没出现过的，长大了也得有。
When I was young, I grew up to have, when I was young, I didn't see it, I had to grow up.
在玩的过程，国内逐渐形成了很多圈子，于是多了很多潮玩批发商，批发商又衍生出无数零售商。
In the course of playing, the country gradually formed a lot of circles, so many more tide game wholesalers, wholesalers derived from countless retailers.
2016年，大V开了一家淘宝店，专卖手办和雕像，一直把店铺做到两个皇冠，是淘宝当时比较大的几个二次元雕像店之一。
In 2016, large V opened a Taobao shop, exclusive hands and statues, has been doing shop two crown, Taobao was one of the relatively large number of quadratic statue shops.
以玩起家、以兴趣聚拢创业的人渐渐多了起来。
More and more people are starting their own businesses with interest.
“与其说天天玩这个，还不如自己就做这个工作，把兴趣当作事业。
"I would rather do it myself and take my interest in it as a career than play it every day.
有时候上班不一定是你的爱好，你可能动力没那么足。
Sometimes going to work isn't necessarily your hobby. You may not be as motivated.
”大V干脆辞掉了工作，专职做玩具生意。
"Big V quit his job and became a full-time toy dealer.
那之后，他的工作重心，变成了去世界各地跑展学习，跟设计师打交道，签代理、谈合作。
Since then, his focus has shifted to running exhibitions around the world, dealing with designers, signing agents, talking about cooperation.
去年，他签了自己的设计师，有了自己的品牌，然后把产品推向日本、台湾、香港、泰国等市场。
Last year, he signed up his designer, built his own brand and then pushed his product to Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand and other markets.
同时，大V还开了自己的实体店。
Meanwhile, Big V opened its own brick and mortar store.
然而这次疫情对线下实体店的打击同样是致命的。
But the epidemic's impact on off-line physical stores has also been deadly.
商场虽然开着，80%商户都处于关闭状态。
Although the mall was open, 80 per cent of the businesses were closed.
春节期间，大V试营业了两天，结果一个人都没有。
During the Spring Festival, Big V went on trial for two days and ended up without anyone.
他最后只能无奈地把店铺关掉。
He finally had to shut down the shop.
然而更大的影响来自所有线下玩具展的停办和延期。
The bigger impact, however, comes from the suspension and postponement of all offline toy exhibitions.
去参展在潮玩行业，新人设计师出道，非常仰仗线下玩具展，这要从潮玩设计师产品的销售渠道说起。
Go to the show in the tide play industry, the new designer out, very dependent on the offline toy exhibition, this is from the tide to play designer products sales channels.
潮玩的线下销售渠道，主要包括全球每年大大小小的展会以及合作的实体店；线上渠道则包括微信粉丝群、公众号、各类电商、众筹平台等。
The offline marketing channels include large and small exhibitions and co-operative entities around the world. Online channels include micro-fan groups, public numbers, various types of electronic businesses, crowd-funding platforms, etc.
在这其中，玩具展是最重要的。
Among them, the toy exhibition is the most important.
在玩具展上，设计师能在线下扩充自己的粉丝群，尤其是还没有名气和粉丝基础的新人设计师，可以借由展会完成第一批原始积累。
At the Toy Show, designers can expand their fan base online, especially if they don't already have a reputation and fan base.
同时，线下积累的粉丝粘性大、对品牌忠诚度高，购买力也更强。
At the same time, the accumulation of fans under the line sticky, high loyalty to the brand, purchasing power is stronger.
跑展也是增加曝光度的有效手段。
Running exhibitions are also an effective way to increase exposure.
足够火、曝光度足够高的品牌，只靠十几个粉丝群，就能完成一款产品的销售。
A brand with enough fire and exposure can sell a product with just a dozen fans.
核心粉丝的购买力足够支撑起一款产品的全部线上销售。
The purchasing power of core fans is enough to support all online sales of a product.
2020年日本WF/受访者供图大V估算过某个知名潮玩品牌的粉丝购买力。
In 2020, WF / respondents in Japan estimated the purchasing power of fans of a well-known video game brand.
每位核心粉丝每年购买正式发售的原价产品就将近2万元，这还不算闲鱼和二手市场收购。
Each core fan buys nearly $20, 000 a year for the original product on sale, not to mention fish and second-hand market acquisitions.
大部分限量款产品是多数玩家买不到的。
Most limited-price products are beyond the reach of most players.
在正式发售前，粉丝要靠抽奖先抽取购买资格，那些没有被抽到的忠实粉丝就会进入二手市场交易。
Before the official launch, fans will be required to draw a lottery to qualify for the purchase, and those who have not been drawn will enter the second-hand market.
算下来，在一个品牌上，每位核心粉丝每年的消费就不止2万元，能有2倍甚至更多。
On one brand, each core fan consumes more than $20,000 a year, twice or more.
对于很多独立设计师来说，除了收入上依赖展会，展会也是他们发掘其他设计师以及和粉丝交流的重要机会。
For many independent designers, in addition to relying on revenues from exhibitions, exhibitions are also an important opportunity for them to explore other designers and communicate with fans.
对很多独立设计师来说，线上售卖的本质只是一张照片。
For many independent designers, the essence of online sales is just a photograph.
潮玩属于典型体验式消费，需要直观地看，实体触摸，促成购买也离不开视觉冲击和冲动因素。
The tidal play belongs to the typical experiential consumption, needs to see intuitively, the entity touch, causes the purchase also cannot leave the visual impact and the impulse factor.
大部分线上售卖，品牌针对的都是有限的粉丝群体，而线下展会贡献的则是源源不断的新客流。
Most online sales, brands are aimed at a limited fan base, while offline exhibitions contribute a steady stream of new visitors.
制作潮玩的材质大概分几种。
There are probably several kinds of materials used to make tide games.
偏软的是搪胶，而多数手办用的是PVC材质，还有偏重的树脂。
The soft is enamel, and most of the hand is made of PVC material, there is also a preference for resin.
不同的材质决定了不同的玩具会有不同的触感和细腻程度，这是潮玩与其他产品不同的魅力所在，通过触感和色彩，达到玩家与设计者心意相通的效果。
Different materials determine that different toys will have different tactile and delicacy, which is the charm of tide play and other products, through touch and color, players and designers to achieve the same effect.
刺球是典型的艺术创作者，毕业于伦敦艺术大学中央圣马丁艺术与设计学院，专业是角色动画。
A typical art creator, he graduated from the Central St Maarten School of Art and Design, London University of Art, specializing in character animation.
潮玩设计是他的另一爱好，他同时也是The Foxfrank Studio品牌的主理人。
Tide design is another of his hobbies, and he is also the managing director of The Foxbank Studio brand.
他创作的IP“狐兰克”是一只有点呆呆的狐狸，爱好美食、旅行，对生活充满着好奇。
His IP "Fox Lank" is a bit stupefied fox, like food, travel, full of curiosity about life.
这个狐狸潮玩用得就是树脂，尽管有时因为材质原因导致携带时易碎，但他认为触感也是设计者与粉丝的对话方式。
The fox thrives on resin, and although it is sometimes brittle for material reasons, he thinks tactile is also a way for designers to talk to fans.
树脂的重量感是他想要呈现出来的，但只看照片是无法理解的。
The weight of the resin was what he wanted to present, but it was incomprehensible to look at the pictures alone.
。
.
刺球的作品“狐兰克”从另一个角度看，他也并不认为疫情期间是潮玩线上销售的爆发点。
On the other hand, Fox Lank, the puncher, does not think of the epidemic as a flashpoint for online sales.
“如果买菜、吃饭都成问题，物流也不便利，玩家可能没有那么多心思去考虑其他消费。
"If buying food or eating is problematic and logistics are not convenient, players may not have the luxury of thinking about other expenses.
”对潮玩，包括其他非刚需娱乐型产品来说，疫情期间的线上消费可能只解决了一小部分问题。
For tide games, including other non-just entertainment products, online consumption during the epidemic may have solved only a small part of the problem.
工厂复工大V旗下签约设计师小李，是原创IP“森林邮便局”的作者，她现在还是中国传媒大学的学生。
Li Xiaoli, a contract designer for VR, is the author of the original IP "Forest PostalPlus" and is now a student at the Communication University of China.
以往每次参展，她都会准备1-2款新品。
In the past, she would prepare 1-2 new items for each exhibition.
新品需要提前和工厂预定制作。
New items need to be made in advance with the factory.
展会延期，原本还可以通过线上销售，但工厂停工，小李也没有办法了。
The exhibition was postponed and could have been sold online, but the factory shut down and Xiao Li had no choice.
国内的潮玩工厂主要位于东莞、深圳一带，很多工人因隔离措施没能及时返工。
Domestic tide play factories are mainly located in Dongguan, Shenzhen, many workers due to isolation measures have not been able to rework.
尽管有个别工厂开始复工，但生产速度远远比不上从前，而且价格也有提升。
Although individual factories have begun to resume work, production has been much slower than before and prices have risen.
设计师姜小在工厂复工后，打了两个产品初样，原本两三百的成本直接涨了一倍多。
After the designer Jiang Xiaoxiao returned to work in the factory, he made two initial samples, the original cost of two or three hundred directly increased more than twice.
刺球有批600多件的玩具，去年年底交了订金，本来今年3月就要出货。
There are more than 600 pieces of gill ball toys, paid a deposit at the end of last year, should have been shipped in March this year.
因为疫情，工厂还没有复工，交付期一直往后拖延。
Because of the outbreak, the plant has not been restarted and the delivery period has been delayed.
“工厂不是在生产你一个人的货，复工以后也会逐次做，只能等复工再去沟通。
"The factory is not producing your own goods, after the resumption of work will be done step by step, can only wait for the resumption of work to communicate.
”刺球也不知道这批货到底什么时候才能拿到。
"Stingers don't know when they're going to get them.
刺球的手涂作品签约设计师和独立设计师、全职设计师和非全职设计师在这次意外中，遭受着不同程度的损失。
Signing designers and independent designers, full-time designers and part-time designers have suffered varying degrees of damage from this accident.
刺球还有一份工作，能够保证起码的收入来源，而小李因为签约了大V的工作室，能够与公司共担风险，公司也会积极联络其他线上渠道，以及帮她解决工厂的问题。
The punching ball also had a job that guaranteed a minimum source of income, and Xiao Li, who signed up to work for Big V, shared the risks with the company, and actively contacted other online channels and helped her with the factory's problems.
对于很多初入潮玩行业的人来说，第一个要踩的坑就是工厂。
For many newcomers to the industry, the first crater to tread on is the factory.
潮玩是特别展现设计师独立意志的创意产品，也许设计师想要的结果工厂领悟了60%，落地到产品上可能只留下30%。
Tide is a creative product that shows the designer's independent will, perhaps 60% of what the designer wants, and only 30% on the product.
除了潮玩制造商，整个制作流程上还有负责给玩具上色的涂装厂，中间环节都有可能出现误差。
In addition to the manufacturers of tide games, the entire production process is responsible for the toy painted factory, intermediate links are likely to appear errors.
新设计师不懂工厂套路，光前期准备阶段，就有可能会损失几十万成本来“交学费”。
New designers do not understand factory routines, pre-preparation phase, may lose hundreds of thousands of costs to "pay tuition."
2017年，国内潮玩市场开始火爆起来，成立于2010年的泡泡玛特让潮玩被更多人关注。
In 2017, the domestic tide market began to boom, and the Bubble Matt, which was established in 2010, attracted more attention.
很多潮玩设计师开始涌现，但发展到今天，还是以出道一年甚至半年的设计师为主。
Many fashion designers began to emerge, but today, or a year or even half a year of the main designers.
大V也曾办过线下展会，80多家参展品牌，一年以上的设计师只占到20%。
Big V has also run off-line exhibitions, more than 80 brands, more than a year of designers accounted for only 20%.
Luke和很多设计师一样，因为喜欢玩具把自己变成了兼职设计师，2019年潮玩市场的爆发让她看到创业的希望。
Luke, like many designers, turned herself into a part-time designer because she liked toys, and the 2019 market explosion gave her hope of starting a business.
今年年前，Luke从上家单位辞了职，对人生和职业规划都进行了重新思考。
Luke resigned from his last job this year, rethinking his life and career plans.
突如其来的疫情，打乱了她的规划，也让她2个月处于基本没有收入的状态。
The sudden outbreak disrupted her plans and left her with little or no income for two months.
修炼内功对小李来说，尽管是放假时间，她基本还在不停创作，以及为之前的玩具思考新的配色。
For Xiao Li, even though it was a vacation time, she basically continued to compose and think about new colors for her toys.
她给自己的规划是至少要想好往后三期的风格和玩具形象。
Her plan for herself is to at least think about the next three issues of style and toy image.
“因为玩具有一个一直更新的过程，随时都需要新东西出现。
"Because toys have an ever-newer process, something new needs to come up at any time.
”除此之外，小李还买了全套涂装工具，在家里用白模手工涂装。
In addition, Xiao Li bought a complete set of painting tools and painted them manually in white mould at home.
。
.
Nuby的头部涂装通常情况下，设计师手里都会自留一部分白模。
Nuby's head painting usually leaves a little white mold in the designer's hand.
所谓白模，就是工厂生产出的最原始产品，还没有送到涂装厂上色涂装。
The so-called white mold, is the factory produced the most original products, has not been sent to the painting factory color painting.
一款产品形象一旦确定，就可以批量生产。
Once a product image is defined, it can be mass produced.
但是设计师会根据同样的模型调整色彩或小配饰，以适应玩具展或者不同节日的定制版。
But designers adjust colors or accessories to the same model to suit toy exhibitions or custom-made versions of different festivals.
潮玩的设计、制作过程大致是，设计师首先建立一个角色宇宙。
The design and production process of tide games is that designers first create a character universe.
比如小李，她的“森林邮便局”并不是只有单个人物，而更多的是一个场景。
Xiao Li, for example, is not just a single character, but a scene.
主角Nuby是其中一个角色，小李给Nuby的怪癖定义为“没睡懒觉会咧着嘴发脾气一整天。
The protagonist, Nuby, defines Nuby's quirk as "a grin all day long without sleeping in."
”Nuby的记忆点就是她的嘴巴，看起来凶凶的。
"Nuby's memory is her mouth, which looks vicious.
。
.
Nuby的设计师手稿一款产品角色或世界观设定好后，设计师根据设计图，在电脑上建立模型，渲染色彩后，发给工厂。
Nuby's Designer Manuscripts After a product role or world view is set, the designer builds the model on the computer, renders the color, and sends it to the factory.
然后还有反复的沟通、修改、修正，直到把相对粗糙的样品变得离设计师的想象更接近。
Then there was the repetitive process of communication, modification, and modification until the relatively coarse samples were brought closer to the designer's imagination.
对于独立设计师来说，可能第一批只出几十个。
For independent designers, there may be only a few dozen in the first place.
之后遇到其他节日，比如情人节，可能再预售几十个。
Then there are other holidays, such as Valentine's Day, and maybe dozens more.
他们大多产能较小，一般大的生产厂家并不喜欢接这类单子，只能找一些小的玩具工厂。
Most of them have less capacity, and the average big manufacturer doesn't like to take such orders, so they have to look for small toy factories.
在特殊时期，产能有限情况下，他们比大的潮玩品牌也更难获得话语权。
In special times, when capacity is limited, they are less able to gain a voice than big-ticket brands.
而刺球，年前他的上一批产品已经卖断了货。
And the punching ball, his last batch of products has sold out years ago.
但是粉丝群还需要保持活跃，需要有人不停地在群里交流。
But fans still need to be active and someone needs to be in constant communication with the group.
刺球因为没有签约公司，他需要和小管家一起打理微信群。
With no contract company, he needs to take care of the crowd with the butler.
给粉丝发福利，保持活跃度，成了刺球新的日常。
To the benefit of fans, keep active, has become a new daily punching ball.
“我会给他们画一画小头像，也会准备一些其他福利。
"I'm going to paint them a picture, and I'm going to have some other fringe benefits.
”大V利用这段空档期，把注意力都集中在了加强产品设计上。
Big V took advantage of the hiatus to focus on strengthening product design.
对他们来说，之前是挤着时间去做这些事。
For them, it was time to do these things.
现在他安排了几条线，包括新的形象、新的品牌，都在抓设计。
Now he has arranged several lines, including the new image, the new brand, are all in the design.
按照他的规划，工厂复工前，他们要完成半年到一年的设计工作。
According to his plan, they would have to complete half a year to a year's design work before the plant returned to work.
等工厂恢复产能后，就能帮他们安排生产。
Once the plants are back in production, they can arrange production for them.
互动与联合张啸吟从2004年就进入了玩具行业，他是最早一批在中国从事创意玩具生意的创业者。
Interactive and United, Mr. Zhang has been in the toy industry since 2004, and was one of the first entrepreneurs to set up creative toys in China.
当初，还没有“潮玩”“IP”这类概念。
At the beginning, there was no such concept as "tidal play" or "IP."
2005年左右，互联网逐渐普及，流行了5年的博客成为最早一批“娃友”的交流阵地。
Around 2005, the Internet became more and more popular, and blogs, popular for five years, became the first places of communication for baby-friends.
张啸吟他们通过博客、论坛卖玩具，玩家通过留言交流、购买，再通过银行卡转账的方式汇钱，最后张用邮政系统把“快递”发出。
Zhang Wuyin they sell toys through blogs, forums, players through the exchange of messages, purchase, and then transfer money through bank cards, the last Zhang "express" issued by the postal system.
2006年，张啸吟成立了涵盖玩具、衍生品、周边在内的北京陈幸福玩具有限公司。
In 2006, Mr. Zhang founded Beijing's Chen Happy Toys Co., which covers toys, derivatives and the surrounding area.
2019年，他创立的米糖文创又推出了独立的潮玩品牌“懒人便利商店”。
In 2019, he founded the rice candy creation and launched the independent Tide Playing brand "Lazy People Convenience Shop."
目前，他们的主要销售都围绕线上，和一些比较轻的线下模式，例如快闪店、无人售卖机等。
At present, their main sales are around the line, and some of the lighter offline models, such as flash stores, unsold machines and so on.
。
.
懒人便利商店与电影“唐探3”的合作款张啸吟感到庆幸，他们去年考虑过开拓线下市场，先做了一些快闪店测试市场反应。
Lazy convenience stores and the film "Detective 3" co-operation Zhang Xiaoyin, they considered last year to open up the offline market, do some quick flash shop test market response.
不过，疫情对接下来的计划仍然造成了明显影响。
However, the epidemic continues to have a significant impact on subsequent plans.
2018年，公司整体产品销售量150万件，2019年的销售也超过100万件，但他预估，2020年上半年的销售额同比将会减少50%。
The company sold 1.5 million units in 2018 and more than 1 million in 2019, but he estimates sales will fall 50% YoY in the first half of 2020.
他发现，疫情发生后，另一个明显变化是收到的简历多了起来。
Another noticeable change, he found, was the increase in the number of resumes received after the outbreak.
在BOSS直聘上，他今年收到的简历投递量比去年年初增加了15%，设计师岗位求职者数量突然增加了30%。
He received 15% more CVs this year than he did at the beginning of last year, and the number of designer jobs jumped 30%.
过去那种品牌求着优秀设计师签约的状态被颠倒了过来。
In the past, the brand has been turned upside down in the quest for good designers to sign.
但他认为，对行业来说，这一次危机带来的也未必全是负面影响。
But he said not all of the fallout from the crisis has been negative for the industry.
“疫情过后，可能一部分个体店铺，能力不强、战斗力不强的公司，确实会遇到危机甚至倒闭。
"After the epidemic, it is possible that some of the individual shops, weak, weak companies, will indeed encounter crisis and even collapse.
但通过这次疫情，地产公司的招商政策、租金政策，也会有相应调整。
But through this outbreak, the real estate company's policy of investment promotion, rental policy, will be adjusted accordingly.
“张啸吟判断，如果他们不变，大家都会面临更大的压力，所以一定会相互让步，做一些调整。
'If they didn't change, everyone would be under more pressure, so they'd give in and make some adjustments, 'Mr. Zhang says.
“对玩具行业，尤其是实体店，有可能下半年或明年，是最好的扩张机会。
"The toy industry, especially physical stores, is likely to be the best expansion in the second half of the year or next."
”懒人便利商店的快闪店2019年张啸吟做了大大小小15场疫情期间，张啸吟迅速组织了短视频团队，继续把精力放在线上。
Lazy convenience store flash store Zhang Wuyin did 15 epidemics in 2019, and Mr. Zhang quickly organized a short video team to keep his focus online.
现在他们每天的主要工作集中在讨论短视频脚本、试音、选配音演员上，新的短视频也将在近期开拍。
Their main daily work is now focused on short video scripts, auditions, and casting, and new short videos will be filmed in the near future.

就目前，国内的潮玩还只是集中在几个类别上。
At present, the domestic tide play is still concentrated in a few categories.

But I hope that this black swan incident will inspire more people, put down their bodies, unite, and complement each other, rather than doing their own thing.
这样才能让潮玩行业打破原有的天花板。
