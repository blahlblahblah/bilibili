···············武汉大学中南医院急诊科护士郭琴，是在1月13日确诊感染新型冠状病毒的。
Guoqin, an emergency nurse at Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital, was confirmed to be infected with the new coronavirus on January 13.
24日、26日，连续两次核酸检测呈阴性，经专家确认后，27日办理了出院手续。
24, 26, two consecutive nucleic acid tests negative, confirmed by experts, 27 days after the procedures for discharge.
1月28日，出院第二天，她主动申请回到岗位继续上班。
On 28 January, the day after her discharge, she voluntarily applied to return to work.
“不害怕是不可能的。
"It is impossible not to be afraid.
但我是第一个被感染的，要起到带头作用。
But I'm the first one to get infected. Take the lead.
如果一直这样担心下去，那我什么时候上班？如果都像我这样，那谁来上班？你如果先这样做了，大家是不是就觉得不那么恐惧。
If I keep worrying like this, when will I go to work? If it's all like me, who comes to work? If you do it first, people don't feel so scared.
我也可以像她一样，不害怕。
I can be just like her. I'm not afraid.
”郭琴不知道自己是什么时候被感染的。
Guo did not know when she had been infected.
“在一线，就是有这种风险。
"In the first place, there is that risk.
”郭琴今年38岁，已经在中南医院工作15年。
Guo, 38, has been working in the South-Central Hospital for 15 years.
1月，她在急诊重症监护室（ICU）参与救治了6位病人，1位重症，5位轻症，至今已全部出院。
In January, she helped treat six patients in the Emergency Intensive Care Unit (ICU), one critically ill and five light cases, all of whom have since been discharged.
重症病人是一位55岁男性胡先生，进来时已经呼吸衰竭。
The critically ill patient, a 55-year-old male named Hu, came in with respiratory failure.
医院给他进行了高流量吸氧治疗。
The hospital treated him with high-flow oxygen.
后面开始用呼吸机，气管插管。
Back to the ventilator, trachea cannula.
最后上了体外膜肺仪（ECMO）。
Finally, an external membrane lung instrument (ECMO) was used.
最终，胡先生在1月28日治愈出院，全网报道——这是湖北省第一例ECMO治愈成功案例。
In the end, Mr. Hu was discharged from hospital on January 28, the first case of an ECMO cure in Hubei province to be reported online.
确诊入院那天，郭琴想起了这位患者。
On the day he was admitted to hospital, Guo recalled the patient.
“不知道自己会不会发展成那样？”住院第一天，她一夜未眠。
"I don't know if I'll ever grow up like that?" On her first day in hospital, she stayed up all night.
“监护仪的报警声，每一床在响。
"The alarm of the monitor, every bed is ringing.
还有呻吟声、痛苦声。
There were groans and agonies.
病人呼叫护士的铃声。
The patient rang the nurse's bell.
治疗车滑行的声音。
The sound of a therapeutic car taxiing.
”她尤其记得同事的脚步声。
She remembered in particular the footsteps of her workmates.
作为护士，他们日常职业训练要求“走路要轻，关门要轻，说话要轻”。
As nurses, their daily professional training requires "walking light, closing the door light, speaking softly."
但那一夜，她听到的脚步声是急促的。
But that night the sound of footsteps was rapid.
穿着防护服的护士步履匆忙，发出特有的沙沙声。
The nurse in protective clothing hurried and made a peculiar rustle.
第二天一早，郭琴对着来看望的护士长说，“明心（郭琴同事）昨晚忙了一夜。
The next morning, Guo Qin said to the head nurse who had come to see him. "Mingxin (Guo Qin colleague) was busy all night last night.
”郭琴心疼同事，护士长也心疼。
Guo Zhen loves her colleagues and the head nurse aches.
睡不着时，郭琴会看11岁的儿子送给她的书。
When unable to sleep Guo Qin would read a book given to her by her 11-year-old son.
小男孩不太会表达情感，通话时对妈妈说“我今天给你的书，你看了没有？你不要想其他的，我们交流书就好了”。
The little boy is not very emotional, said to his mother on the phone "I gave you the book, you read it? You don't think of other, we exchange books."
后来，他逐渐开始表达担心，渐渐也会说，“我们一定能够胜利”。
Then, gradually, he began to express his concern, and gradually he would say, "We are sure to win."
以下是郭琴的口述（注：本文电话采访于2月2日晚间至2月3日凌晨）。
This is Guo Qin's dictation (Note: This telephone interview is from the night of Feb. 2 to the early morning of Feb. 3).
❶“我会不会发展成他那样？”我是1月12日晚上开始出现发热症状的，体温37.8℃。
"Will I grow into him?" I started febrile symptoms on January 12 night, with a temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius.
当时吃了退烧药，第二天，又开始高烧、头痛、四肢酸痛，意识到和此次新型冠状病毒肺炎有关，赶快联系医院用急救车把我拉走，做CT，显示双肺是“毛玻璃样影”。
After taking the antipyretic, the next day, he had a high fever, a headache and sore limbs. Realizing that this coronavirus pneumonia was related to the new coronavirus pneumonia, we contacted the hospital and pulled me away in an ambulance for a CT scan showing that my lungs were "glass-like."
其实我们知道这个事件后，也是第一时间按照要求，做好防护措施。
In fact, we know this incident, but also the first time as required, to do a good job of protection.
但肯定无法百分百避免。
But certainly not 100%.
那段时间工作很忙，我每天只睡5小时，免疫力也会下降。
It was a busy time, I slept 5 hours a day and my immunity was reduced.
在急诊，风险就是这样的。
In emergencies, that's the risk.
发现自己确诊时，我有点紧张、担心。
When I found myself diagnosed, I was a little nervous and worried.
因为我参与过一个重症的抢救。
Because I was involved in a serious rescue.
那个患者当时既没有明显病史，又是55岁男性，就身体条件看算是可以的。
The patient, who had no apparent medical history and was a 55-year-old man, was physically fit.
但是他后来状况不好，出现了呼吸窘迫综合征。
But he was in a bad condition and developed respiratory distress syndrome.
呼吸很快，每分钟40~50次（正常值约为20次/分），血氧饱和度就是百分之七八十（正常值约为98%），这是重症的呼吸困难。
Breathing quickly, 40-50 times per minute (normal value about 20 times / minute), and oxygen saturation of the blood is 80% (normal value about 98%), which is severe respiratory distress.
如果不上支持措施，后面就会越来越衰竭。
If support is not provided, it will wither away.
我们一开始给了氧疗，后面做了呼吸机，插了管，最后上了体外膜肺仪（ECMO），才治好。
We started with oxygen therapy, we had a ventilator in the back, we inserted a tube, and finally we had ECMO.
我想，我担心，我会不会发展成他那样？我在ICU做护理，需要给每个病人心理支持。
I thought, I was worried, would I grow into him? I work in the ICU and need psychological support for every patient.
特别是现在，没有家属陪伴的情况。
Especially now, there are no family members.
我告诉病人不要紧张，告诉他疾病是什么样的，他的用药是什么样的，后面可能会发生什么事情，告诉他如何饮食。
I told the patient not to get nervous, to tell him what the disease was, what his medication was, what might happen later, and how to eat.
他就心里有数，就不会那么担心、害怕了。
He knew enough so that he would not be so worried and afraid.
如果是重症病人，不能说话了，我就会用触摸、接触的方式，给予他一些语言的传递，让他镇静。
If the patient is seriously ill and cannot speak, I will use touch, contact, give him some language transmission, let him calm down.
跟他做操作时，他可能不会说话，他也搞不明白，但我还是会跟他讲，“我现在给你打针了”、“我现在给你吸痰”、“你要配合一下，可能有点疼”。
He may not be able to speak or understand him when he's working with him, but I'll still tell him, "I'm giving you an injection," "I'm going to suck your phlegm now," "You need to work on it, maybe it hurts a bit."
就是把患者当成正常人，即使他躺在床上，已经什么都不知道了。
That is to treat the patient as a normal person, even if he is lying in bed, no longer know anything.
工作中的郭琴（来源：新华社 新青年工作室）入院当晚，我一直输液到凌晨两点，一夜没睡着。
Guo Qin at Work (Source: Xinhua News Agency's New Youth Studio) On the night of my admission, I had been infusion until 2 a.m. and had not slept all night.
发热、恶心，最明显的感受是痛。
Fever, nausea, the most obvious feeling is pain.
头痛，肌肉酸痛，还有关节疼痛。
Headaches, muscle aches, and joint pain.
我以前感冒也发热、乏力，但疼痛没有这么明显。
I used to have a cold with fever and fatigue, but the pain was not so pronounced.
确实是有不同的，和一般感冒不一样。
It's different. It's different from the common cold.
全身关节都在胀痛，痛到我当时起身的时候，都会有困难。
All over the body joints are painful, pain to the time I got up, will have difficulties.
我还在想，是不是我哪里自己扭到了？我只能尽量不动。
I was wondering if I had twisted it myself. I had to try not to move.
晚上，需要用热水袋去敷，不然就胀得没办法睡着。
At night, you need to pack it in a hot water bag, or you'll be too swollen to sleep.
第二天，我从早上9点开始输液，好几轮，一直输到晚上8、9点，配合一些氧疗、雾化。
The next day, I began infusion at 9 am, several rounds, until 8, 9 pm, with some oxygen therapy, atomization.
晚上，也没怎么睡好。
At night, I didn't sleep very well.
作为护士我知道睡眠很重要，我必须睡得好，其他都是辅助治疗，我很了解自己。
As a nurse I know sleep is important, I have to sleep well, the rest is adjuvant therapy, and I know myself well.
但我睡不着。
But I can't sleep.
医院以前是我工作的场所，现在我突然转变成病人的角色，有点不适应。
The hospital used to be my place of work, but now I suddenly took on the role of a patient, a little out of place.
第二天晚上，是我自己的一个同事上班。
The next night, it was one of my own colleagues at work.
我印象很深刻那个晚上，监护仪的报警声，是每一床它都在不停地响，还有那种呻吟声、痛苦声，病人的呻吟。
I was impressed by the alarm of the monitor that night, every bed it kept ringing, and the groans, the pain, the patient's moans.
然后还有治疗车的声音等等。
And then there's the sound of a therapist car.
这些声音，它没办法让你入睡。
These sounds. It can't get you to sleep.
还有特别就是，同事的脚步声。
And, in particular, the footsteps of colleagues.
我们以前说作为护士，晚上要尽量不打扰到病人，所以我们走路要轻、关门要轻、说话要轻，这是对我们职业的一个要求。
We used to say that as nurses, we should try not to disturb the patients at night, so we should walk light, close the door and speak softly, which is a requirement for our profession.
但是穿防护服走路的时候，有那种沙沙沙的声音。
But when you walk in protective gear, there's that rustle.
而且护士走路的声音，非常匆忙。
And the nurse walked in such a hurry.
一晚上，真的是一晚上，一直到早上。
One night, really one night, till morning.
我当时躺在那儿，我就好心疼好心疼。
I was lying there, my heart ached and my heart ached.
因为我想到了自己。
Because I think about myself.
她一忙下来的时候，当她脚步声停下来的时候，她就站在了我的床边。
As soon as she was busy, she stood by my bedside when her footsteps stopped.
我可以感受到，她就看着我，但她没有跟我说话。
I could feel her looking at me, but she wasn't talking to me.
大概有三四次。
About three or four times.
她每次一站过来，我就很想，很想哭。
Every time she came over, I wanted to, I wanted to cry.
因为我想到了自己平时也是这样去看病人，也是这样忙碌，是吧？那个感觉不太一样。
Because I thought I was going to see a patient like that, and I was so busy, didn't I? It was different.
就觉得，原来我是这样的一个工作状态。
I felt that I was such a working state.
真的是好辛苦啊。
It's really hard work.
我也心疼她呀。
I love her too.
我想起来帮她，但是没办法。
I thought of helping her, but there was nothing I could do.
我想我平时像这样上班的时候，当我觉得很无助的时候，也希望有个人一起帮下忙。
I think I usually work like this, when I feel very helpless, also hope that there is a person to help.
但我没办法。
But I can't help it.
就很心疼她。
I love her very much.
当时我们需要喝水的话，护士需要到外面打水，再送进来。
If we needed a drink, the nurse needed to fetch water outside and bring it in.
早上送一批进来，我喝完了，我就真不好意思再去找她们。
Send in a batch in the morning, I am drunk, I am really ashamed to go to look for them again.
你知道吗？我也想到了我以前的病人。
You know what? I also think of my former patients.
当他出现状况，他不汇报。
When something happens to him, he doesn't report it.
我问他为什么你不喊我？他说，我不好意思喊你们。
I asked him why you didn't shout at me? 'he said.' I'm sorry to call you. '
那个时候，我一下体会到，为什么病人会跟我说这样的话。
At that time, I quickly realized why patients would say such things to me.
第二天早上，护士长一来，我就跟护士长说，你知道吗？明心（音）昨天忙了一晚上。
The next morning, when the head nurse arrived, I said to the head nurse, You know, Minxin was busy all night yesterday.
我说我听到她那个脚步声，听到所有的声音。
I said I heard her footsteps. I heard all the sounds.
我说太辛苦了。
I said it was too hard.
护士长她也蛮辛苦，她可能当时感受到我的情绪，我俩都有些难过。
It was hard work for the head nurse, and she probably felt my emotions, and we were both a little upset.
那个时候我就有了想法，我跟她说我要是好了，恢复了，我就回来上班。
Then I had an idea, and I told her that if I was okay and recovered, I would come back to work.
❷“他渐渐开始说，我们一定能够胜利”睡不着的时候，我会看孩子给我的书。
"Zen" he gradually began to say that we will win "when unable to sleep, I will look at the children gave me the book.
我有一个11岁的孩子，男孩。
I have an 11-year-old boy.
当时确诊感染时，我给儿子发信息：爸爸很辛苦，你自己可以承担的就要自己去做，尽量减少爸爸的负担。
When the infection was diagnosed, I sent a message to my son: Dad is very hard, you can take it on your own to do it, to minimize the burden on Dad.
我也跟爱人说，这段时间可能要辛苦你了，好好照顾孩子。
I also told the lover, this time may have to work hard for you, take good care of the children.
有些人说是遗言，其实不是（笑）。
Some people say it's a will, but it's not.
我是护士，对自己的身体状况有评估。
I'm a nurse. I have an assessment of my health.
但害怕和担心是绝对存在的。
But fear and fear are absolute.
我的爱人开始有点不知所措，到底怎么了？有这么严重？感冒还需要隔离治疗？要隔离多久，他也不知道。
My love begins a little bit at a loss, after all what? Have so serious? Colds still need isolated treatment? Want to isolate how long, he also does not know.
他还以为难道是我没有给他说真实情况。
He thought I hadn't told him the truth.
他进医院，看到很多地方封闭，写着“家属免进”，他才开始紧张。
He went to the hospital, saw many places closed, said "no family members enter", he began to nervous.
我们整个病房，当时用警戒线和临时装置围起来，他给我送东西，都只能在过道之外，很远。
Our entire ward was surrounded by pickets and makeshift devices, and he had to deliver things to me out of the hallway, far away.
打电话给我，我才让里面的人把东西拿进来。
Call me, and I'll have the people inside bring in the stuff.
郭琴（右）在医院隔离治疗。
Guoqin (right) is isolated in hospital for treatment.
（来源：南方都市报）我的孩子，不会特别流露自己的情感。
(Source: Southern Metropolis Daily) My children do not particularly express their feelings.
他没有哭。
He didn't cry.
小时候，他经常生病，因为我是护士嘛，有时就在家里照顾他，没有住院。
When I was a child, he was often ill because I was a nurse. Sometimes he was taken care of at home and not hospitalized.
他得过流感，发烧也有三四天不退。
He had the flu and had a fever for three or four days.
他对疾病的过程很清楚。
He is well aware of the course of the disease.
他觉得妈妈看着还好，是不是就是普通感冒？看到新闻，很多病例、封城，他才开始担心。
He thought his mother looked okay, is it a common cold? See the news, many cases, closure, he began to worry.
他也会问我，是不是大家都太紧张了？“我看那个报的病例大多数是轻症，和妈妈症状差不多。
He would also ask me if everyone was too nervous? "I think most of the reported cases were mild, similar to my mother's symptoms.
”我问他，你怎么都不关心妈妈？妈妈住院了，你不担心吗？他说，“我生病的时候，你不是也照顾过我？你应该可以照顾好自己的。
"I asked him, why don't you care about Mom? Mom's in the hospital, aren't you worried ？" You didn't take care of me when I was sick ？ You should be able to take care of yourself ． "
”（笑）我说，你好奇怪，怎么跟其他小孩不太一样？他就会把话题岔开，“我今天给你的书，你看了没有啊？你不要说其他的，反正我每天给你的书，你去看，我们交流书就好了。
"(Laughter) I said, you're surprised how it's different from other kids?" He would turn the conversation aside and say, "Did you read the book I gave you today? Don't say anything else.
”我不知道，他是不是以另一种方式在宽慰我。
I don't know whether he was comforting me in another way.
我看完了他给的书，曹文轩的《火印》，每天和他视频通话交流。
I finished reading the book he gave, Cao Wenxuan's "Lithography," and spoke with him on video every day.
他一直是这样，不会说，会用小男孩的行动来表达。
He has always been like this, can not say, will use the little boy's action to express.
以前，比方说他想我了，他会来问我，“妈妈，你今天上不上班？你今天上什么班？”我一说上班，他就默默走开。
Before, for example, he would come to me and ask, "Mom, are you off today? What class are you on today?" I said to work, and he walked away silently.
我说不上班，他的表情一下不一样，话就变得特别多。
When I said no to work, his expression changed and he became particularly talkative.
其实，他就是想说，我希望你不要上班，我希望你多陪一下我（笑）。
In fact, he just want to say, I hope you do not work, I hope you stay with me a little more (smile).
这两天，我在微信上会把我看见的一些感动的事情发给他。
Over the past two days, I will send him some moving things I have seen in my letters.
比如钟南山院士的一些讲话，还有市民送我们的东西，鼓励的贺卡、花。
For example, some speeches by academician Zhong Nan Shan, as well as citizens to give us things, encouraging cards, flowers.
我说，其实妈妈往前面走，虽然觉得有危险，但是就是因为这些市民一直在感动我，我才会一直往前走。
I said, in fact, my mother to go forward, although feel dangerous, but it is because these citizens have been moving me, I will go forward.
然后，他就发了一些哭的表情。
Then he began to cry a little.
他渐渐就会说什么，我们一定能够胜利啊。
Little by little he would say that we would be victorious.
❸“如果我也害怕，大家可能都不干了”我觉得我性格上比较坚韧。
"If I'm scared, everyone might quit." I think I'm tough.
在住院时，我看了不少书。
When I was in hospital, I read a lot of books.
有同事送来的《内心的冲突》，心理学的，告诉自己怎么样树立信心。
Colleagues from work, Psychology, tell yourself how to build confidence.
还有孩子给的《火印》，他还给了我一本杨绛的。
And the children gave "Lightning", he also gave me a burgundy Yang.
也有同事推荐我看一些轻松的电影，但我自己选择看纪录片。
Some colleagues recommend me to watch some light movies, but I choose to watch documentaries myself.
因为我想，我对病毒的认识还不够深。
Because I don't think I know enough about the virus.
心理、生理是相融通的。
Psychology and physiology are interwoven.
加强对一些东西的理性认识，就不会在情感上过度反应。
To strengthen the rational understanding of some things, there will be no emotional overreaction.
我看了讲SARS、埃博拉的纪录片。
I watched a documentary about SARS and Ebola.
24号、26号，连续两次核酸检测是阴性，专家确认，27日正式治愈。
24, 26, two consecutive nucleic acid tests are negative, experts confirmed, 27 officially cured.
当时领导们让我再休息一段时间。
The leaders asked me to take another break.
但我觉得我状态已经很好了。
But I think I'm in good shape.
我告诉家里人要回医院上班。
I told my family to go back to work.
郭琴在护理病人（来源：新华社 新青年工作室）我爸看到我要走，他说，你就在家休息，现在已经这么严重，不要去了。
Guo Qin is nursing sick people (source: Xinhua News Agency New Youth Studio) When my father saw I was leaving, he said, You just rest at home.
“你要对自己的决定负责。
"You are responsible for your own decisions.
孩子啊、家里人，你对他们来说都很重要。
Children, family, you mean a lot to them.
你不上班，地球也一样转。
If you don't work, so does the earth.
缺了你一个也不是不可以。
It's not impossible to be without you.
”我爸说了特别多，让我一定要想清楚。
"My father said so much that I had to think it over.
其实当时也顶了压力。
In fact, it was under pressure.
我跟爸爸沟通，风险是会存在，但是这个时候我不能退缩。
I talked to Dad. The risk was there, but I couldn't back down at the moment.
最重要的是，我是（中南医院）第一个被感染的。
Most importantly, I was the first person to be infected.
当时没有硬性规定，其实你想休多长时间，就能休多长时间，没有谁会说一定得让你去。
There was no hard and fast rule. You could take as long as you wanted, and no one would say you had to.
那如果所有的医护人员，都这样想，怎么办？如果我一开始就害怕，不站出来，大家说你看她也害怕，那咱们是不是也不干了？大家都会想要闹，后面都犹豫，我是不是可以不上班。
So what if all the paramedics think that, what if I start out scared and don't stand up and everybody says she's scared too? Everybody wants to make a scene and hesitates at the back, can I skip work?
这是一个很现实的问题，很现实，也很直接。
This is a very real question, realistic and straightforward.
你如果先这样做了，大家是不是就觉得不那么恐惧？我也可以像她一样，不害怕。
If you did that first, would people feel less scared? I could be just like her, not afraid.
在这个时候，我要起到一个带头作用。
At this time, I want to take the lead.
1月23日，我看到武汉封城的消息。
On January 23, I saw the news of the closure of Wuhan.
我其实觉得，做出这种决定，是蛮有勇气，也是对全世界负责任的。
I actually feel that it was courageous and responsible to the world to make such a decision.
我不仅是医护人员，也是我家乡的人。
I'm not only a paramedics, I'm also from my hometown.
我也希望用自己的行动，为家乡做点事情，当时就有这个想法。
I also wanted to do something for my hometown with my own actions, and that was the idea back then.
我不能退缩。
I cannot shrink back.
后来，我爸看到我走了，其实他还是蛮骄傲的。
Later, my dad saw me go, but he was still very proud.
他在家庭群里说，郭琴很勇敢。
He said in the family group, Guo Qin is very brave.
他呼吁我舅舅、姑妈，都为我加油。
He appealed to my uncle and aunt to cheer for me.
❹“我来医院上班，刚好是危重症患者出院那一天”我康复后第一天返工，是警察送我回医院的。
"I came to the hospital to work, just the day the critically ill patient left hospital." I returned to work on my first day of recovery.
当时封路了，一个警察在路边看到我，问我是不是医务人员？我说是。
When the road was closed, a policeman saw me by the side of the road and asked me if I was a medic.
他就直接把我送到医院来了。
He sent me straight to the hospital.
临走前，他还给我敬礼，说“大家都需要你，你要坚强、加油”。
Before leaving, he also saluted me, saying, "Everyone needs you, you have to be strong, refueling."
前几天，我去上班，有一个外卖小哥，他看到我在路上走，就停下来了。
The other day, I went to work, there was a take-out brother, he saw me walking on the road, he stopped.
我说我要去中南医院上班。
I said I was going to work in Zhongnan Hospital.
他也是说，那我载你吧。
He said too. I'll give you a ride.
其实不远，我走路20分钟就能到。
It's not far. I can walk for 20 minutes.
他就用他外卖的车载我去医院。
He took me to the hospital in his takeaway car.
去了也说，“你们一定要好好的，加油”。
Go to also say, "you must be good, refueling."
然后他就走了。
Then he went away.
哎，就是很感人，很暖心。
Oh, just very touching, very warm.
我看到物资陆陆续续送到医院。
I saw supplies trickling into the hospital.
一些市民帮送饭，早餐、中餐、晚餐，都有市民在送。
Some citizens help with the delivery of food, breakfast, Chinese food, dinner, are all in the public delivery.
甚至有小朋友寄的零花钱。
There are even pocket money from children.
有一个小朋友，买了一两碗饭，直接送到医院里。
A little friend bought a bowl or two of rice and took it directly to the hospital.
他说，叔叔阿姨，我可能，因为自己只是一个小朋友，我用我的零花钱表达自己的心意。
He said, uncle and aunt, I may, because I am just a little friend, I use my pocket money to express their own mind.
这个礼物不太重，但我希望能够给你们带来一些鼓励。
This gift is not too heavy, but I hope it will give you some encouragement.
他们给我们鼓励，我们就会一直坚守。
If they give us encouragement, we will stick to it.
我们就需要这样的鼓励。
We need such encouragement.
郭琴和同事在救护车前合影（来源：南方都市报）我们科室总共48名护士，分急诊、抢救、手术、输液、急诊病房等。
Guo and colleagues in front of the ambulance (source: Southern Metropolis Daily) A total of 48 nurses in our department, including emergency, rescue, surgery, infusion, emergency ward, etc.
在我的急诊病房，就只有10位护士。
In my emergency ward, there were only 10 nurses.
我们的夜班特别勤。
We have special night shifts.
昨天（2.1晚）我上了一个前夜，晚上7点到凌晨1点。
I went to school the night before yesterday (2.1 evening) from 7: 00 pm to 1: 00 am.
今天（2.2晚）是凌晨1点到第二天早上8点。
It's 1: 00 a.m. to 8: 00 a.m. today (2.2 evening).
现在（凌晨5:45），有3位护士和我一起在值班。
Now (5: 45 am), three nurses are on duty with me.
从1.13确诊之后，我从来没回过自己家。
I've never been home since the diagnosis of 1.13.
现在住在医院提供的住处，步行20分钟，有5位护士和我住一个房间。
I am now living in a hospital-provided accommodation, walking for 20 minutes, with five nurses sharing a room with me.
其实在ICU里面，生死都是常态，没有特别的感受。
In fact, in the ICU, life and death are the norm, no special feelings.
但我最近更容易哭了。
But I've been crying a lot more lately.
除了护士长那一次，还有很多时候。
Except for the head nurse's once. there's plenty of time.
比如我看到京东的物资车，开往我们医院，我看到这些都会流泪。
For example, I saw the Jingdong goods vehicle, bound for our hospital, I see these will cry.
看到小朋友给我们写的贺卡，那些文字。
