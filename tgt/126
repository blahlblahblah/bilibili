AT & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45
1月26日在湖北新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情防控工作例行新闻发布会上，湖北省省长王晓东称，湖北仙桃在防护服和医用口罩生产领域具有优势。
Hubei province Governor Wang Xiaodong said Hubei Xiantao had an advantage in the field of protective clothing and medical mask production during a regular press conference on January 26 to prevent and control the outbreak of a new coronavirus infection in Hubei Province.
仙桃，被誉为“中国最大的无纺布基地”，聚集上百家成规模的无纺布生产及加工企业，出口量占全国的近三分之一。
Xiantao, known as China's largest non-woven base, gathers hundreds of large-scale non-woven production and processing enterprises, accounting for nearly one-third of the country's exports.
仙桃市政府网站曾披露，2010年上半年，无纺布制品出口7192万美元，占全市出口总值的62%，是支撑仙桃市出口在高基数上持续增长的主要力量。
In the first half of 2010, non-woven products exported 71.92 million U.S. dollars, accounting for 62 percent of the city's total export value, the main force underpinning the city's continued growth in export base.
口罩的主要原材料是无纺布，仙桃也因此成为抗击新型冠状病毒疫情、供应防护物资的重地。
The mask's main raw material is non-woven cloth, peach has become a new-style coronavirus epidemic, the supply of protective materials.
然而在疫情的持续扩大，市场对口罩资源需求的大幅增加，几乎“一罩难求”的情况下，网易清流工作室从仙桃多家口罩厂商处了解，为严查假冒伪劣口罩产品，仙桃市监督局“一刀切”叫停了所有民用口罩生产商。
However, in the continued expansion of the epidemic, the market demand for mask resources has increased substantially, almost "a cover hard to find," Netease clean-up studio from the peach manufacturers, in order to strictly check fake and inferior mask products, Xiantao City Supervision Bureau "across the board" stopped all civilian mask manufacturers.
而这个被誉为全国最大无纺布生产基地，拥有口罩生产的天然优势的地方，陷入更为复杂困境：作为疫情重地，在工人不愿意上班、交通管制，许多口罩商难复工、原材料高度紧俏环境下，全部关停民用口罩厂商，使得市场流通民用口罩大幅减少。
The situation is all the more complicated in a country known as the nation's largest nonwoven manufacturing base, where the natural advantages of mask production lie: where workers are reluctant to go to work, traffic control, many mask vendors are struggling to get back to work and raw materials are in high demand, the market for civilian masks has been drastically reduced.
而未被关掉的、拥有医疗器械资质的厂商自身口罩产能较低，更难以满足需求，将加剧市场口罩的大幅缺口。
And unturned manufacturers with medical-device credentials that have lower capacity to produce their own masks, making it harder to meet demand, will add to the huge gap in market masks.
仙桃市“一刀切”叫停所有民用口罩商2月1日，仙桃一家大型口罩生产商负责人王义（化名）收到工商局的电话通知：没有医疗器械资质的口罩生产商全部关门停止生产。
Fantasy City "across the board" call all civilian mask manufacturers Feb. 1, Xiantao a large mask manufacturer Wang Yi (not his real name) received a telephone call from the Commerce and Industry Bureau: All manufacturers of surgical masks without medical equipment were shut down.
多位仙桃口罩生产商向网易清流工作室确认了这一消息。
Several peach mask manufacturers confirmed the news to Netease Clean-up Studio.
仙桃市紧邻武汉西向100公里，同样属于疫情重灾区，这里不仅是全国最大的无纺布生产基地，也承担全国重要防护物资供给任务。
Xiantao city, which lies 100 kilometers west of Wuhan, is also a disaster area with serious epidemic diseases. It is not only the largest non-woven production base in China, but also responsible for important national defense materials supply tasks.
因此，春节后没几天，仙桃市政府相关部门开始鼓励宣传辖区内无纺布企业做好复工生产准备。
Therefore, a few days after the Spring Festival, the relevant departments of Xiantao City began to encourage the promotion of non-woven enterprises within their jurisdiction to prepare for production.
王义就是较早复工的一批口罩生产商。
Wang Yi is an early resumption of work of a group of mask manufacturers.
王义他们大年初四复工，以3-5倍的工资，吸引员工上岗，加班加点生产口罩。
Wang Yi they return to work early in the year, 3-5 times wages, attract staff on duty, overtime to produce masks.
4天的时间里，他们生产差不多300万只口罩。
In four days, they produced almost three million masks.
随着口罩资源需求增加，市场口罩价格攀升，导致市场涌现各种五花八门的假口罩，甚至出现没有任何“滤材”的三无口罩。
As the demand for mask resources increases, market prices rise, resulting in a wide variety of masks in the market, and even no "filter" of three no-mask.
正是在这个背景下，仙桃市政府在2月1日关停了本地所有的民用口罩生产商。
It was against this backdrop that the city government shut down all local mask makers on February 1.
市场监督管理局官方网站报道称，1月28日，为开展防护用品质量安全检查，保障口罩和防护服正常生产，由市市场监督管理局班子成员牵头，分为10个检查组，出动执法人员300多人，对全市无纺布企业及有关经营单位进行全面检查。
The official website of the Market Supervision Authority reported that on 28 January, 10 inspection teams, headed by members of the Municipal Market Surveillance Administration, conducted a comprehensive inspection of the city's non-woven enterprises and related business units in order to conduct a safety inspection of the quality of protective products and ensure the normal production of masks and protective clothing.
2月2日，仙桃市疫情指挥部发文通告。
On 2 February, the epidemic command of Xiantao issued a communication.
通告称，要加强市场监管，从严查处违法。
The circular said market supervision should be strengthened and laws strictly investigated and punished.
要对通过巡查、检查、举报投诉等各类渠道发现的违法行为，要迅速组织力量从快从严从重查处，涉案产品一律依法扣留。
If illegal activities are discovered through various channels, such as inspection, inspection and reporting of complaints, prompt efforts should be made to seriously investigate and punish the products involved.
但是多位民用口罩生产商称，“政府可以查处假冒伪劣，但是不能一刀切，不能因为个别不良商家行为就把整体生产口罩商都关闭。
But a number of civilian mask makers said: "The government can investigate and punish counterfeiting, but not across the board, not because individual bad business behavior will shut down the entire mask manufacturer.
”王义称，“监管部门现在一刀切，要求所有的没有医疗器械资质的口罩厂商都停止生产，忽略的问题是，在目前口罩紧缺的情况下，民用口罩停产会导致大幅口罩缺口，老百姓买不到口罩；而且仙桃市本身拥有医疗器械资质的企业就不多，他们的产能很低。
"Regulators are now imposing a blanket ban on all manufacturers who are not qualified for medical equipment, ignoring the fact that in the face of the current shortage of masks, the shutdown could lead to huge gaps in masks and people not buying masks," said Wang.
口罩的产能会大幅降低”。
Mask capacity will be significantly reduced. "
多位仙桃市口罩生产商也向网易清流工作室表示，生产医用口罩的机构需要医疗器械资格证，民用口罩生产根本没有资格证，整个仙桃市拥有医疗器械资格证、生产口罩的企业估计也就10来家，大部分口罩生产商都没有资格证。
Many manufacturers of Xiantao masks also told Netease that they needed medical equipment certification, that there was no qualification for the production of civilian masks, that the entire city of Xiantao possessed a certificate for medical equipment, that there were about 10 manufacturers of masks, and that most manufacturers did not have a certificate.
以医疗资质卡脖子，相当于一大部分口罩产能都被掐断。
With medical qualifications jammed around the neck, the equivalent of a large number of surgical masks were cut off.
仙桃市口罩商的难以复工困境然而即便没有前面的“叫停”，仙桃也远未恢复平日的产能。
Xiantao Mouth Mask Merchandiser's Difficulty Returning to Work Dilemma is still far from its usual capacity, even without the "stop-call" ahead.
华北瑞康医用耗材有限公司的负责人李宏宇称，“我们现在原材料紧缺，工人因为担心安全也不愿意上班，我们现在的产能只是平常的1/10。
'We have a shortage of raw materials, workers are reluctant to go to work because of safety concerns, 'said Li Hongyu, head of Ruikang Medical Supplies Co. Ltd., in North China.
”华北瑞康医用耗材有限公司拥有医疗生产资质，却没有能力实现产能的恢复。
North China Ruikang Medical Supplies Co., Ltd. has medical production qualifications, but is unable to achieve capacity recovery.
多位厂商表示，早在春节前期就已经停止生产。
Many manufacturers said that as early as the Spring Festival has stopped production.
除了员工复工艰难外，主要是原材料紧缺。
Besides the difficulty of getting workers back to work, raw materials are scarce.
因为一般到年底，大家都是处于清仓处理货的状态。
Because generally by the end of the year, we are in the clearance of goods in the state.
如果年前没有备货，年后预订根本排不上队。
If we don't have them, we won't be queuing up after three years.
王义的公司早在春节前就预订30吨的无纺布材料，很幸运的是纺布陆陆续续地进入仓库，而高效滤材却是高度紧缺。
Wang Yi's company had ordered 30 tons of nonwoven materials as early as the Spring Festival. Fortunately, the spinning process continued to trickle into the warehouse.
他们年前从大连一家供应商预定了5吨高效滤材。
They ordered five tons of high-efficiency filters from a supplier in Dalian a year ago.
1月29日（大年初五，复工的第二天），王义开始催货，对方称，现在货物不好发，你要不再预定10吨的粘纺布，到时15吨一起发货比较容易。
On January 29th, the day after the resumption of work, Wang Yi began to urge the goods, said that the goods are not easy to send, you will no longer order 10 tons of viscose textile, by then 15 tons together easier to deliver.
王义随后又把10吨粘纺布的款项全部打给对方。
Wang then called the other party all the money from the 10 tons of viscose.
2月3日，王义再次催货时，对方则表示难以发货。
February 3, Wang Yi again urged goods, the other side said that it is difficult to deliver.
他们属于医疗器械资产企业，所有生产由地方政府监督，以先供给本地为主。
They belong to the Medical Device Assets Enterprise, where all production is supervised by the local government and is primarily supplied locally.
“如果有仙桃市政府跟大连政府联系和沟通获得大连政府的明文规定才能尽快安排外地滤纸生产。
"If the Xiantao government and Dalian government contact and communication to obtain the Dalian government's express regulations can arrange for the production of foreign filter paper.
”此后，对方又补充道，“不过还有其他办法，就是你们先免费提供给我们防护口罩，我们也不是自己用，是捐给大连市政府，这样也能早点安排生产”。
"Then the other side added," But there's another way you can give us your masks for free, not for our own use, but for the city government, so we can arrange production earlier. "
王义称，“这仿佛陷入了恶性循环，原材料厂商不断增加附加条件，也是因为口罩紧缺，利用口罩获取地方政府支持，却不愿供给原材料，没有原材料，怎么生产口罩啊”。
"It seems to be in a vicious circle, with raw material producers increasingly imposing conditions," Wang said. "It is also due to the shortage of masks, the use of masks for local government support, but reluctance to supply raw materials, how to make masks."
王义的公司日产能在100万只/天。
Mr. Wang has a daily production capacity of one million.
4天的复工时间生产了300万只。
Three million were produced in four days of back-to-work.
停工后，多家下游商要求拿货，王义很无奈，只能拍摄空荡荡的厂房告诉对方，“已经停工了”，言外之意是并不是不给供货，而是实在没货。
After the shutdown, a number of downstream vendors asked for goods, Wang Yi is helpless, can only shoot empty factory buildings told each other, "has stopped work," the implication is not not to supply, but is really out of stock.
多位中小企业口罩商称，我们早在几天前就关闭了，主要是怕员工感染，出事担不起责任。
A number of small and medium-sized mask manufacturers said that we had closed a few days ago, mainly because of fear of staff infection, accident can not bear the responsibility.
我们自身的产能也比较小，每天也就20万只，不够一个客户的量，出力不讨好。
Our own production capacity is also relatively small, about 200,000 per day, is not enough to a customer volume, do not contribute thankless.
我们就提前关闭不生产了。
We shut down early and stopped producing.
“希望政府引导厂商生产”仙桃民用口罩产能下降，也带来一系列后遗症。
"Hope the government guides manufacturers to produce" peach civilian mask production capacity decline, but also brought a series of sequelae.
“医用（口罩）不让卖，民用口罩不让做，更加买不到口罩，口罩价格从五毛到一块，从一块到二块，只用了几天的时间”。
"Medical (masks) are not allowed to be sold, civilian masks are not allowed, masks are not available, the price of masks goes from fifty cents to one, from one to two, in a matter of days."
王义大吐苦水。
Wang Yichuan bitter water.
多位仙桃口罩生产商称，现在市面上根本买不到口罩。
Many nectarine mask makers say they can't buy one at all.
一只口罩价格1.6元、甚至2元，高的不可想象。
A mask costs $1.6 or even $2, which is unthinkable.
正常情况下，口罩的出厂价格也不过几毛钱一只。
Normally, the factory price of a mask is only a few cents.
网易清流工作室以购买口罩为由拨打仙桃市长兴塑料制品有限公司下查埠分公司一员工电话，对方称，现在价格2元/只，很贵，你要不要？如果需要运输，另加运输费3毛/只。
Netease clean-up studio to purchase masks as a reason to dial Xiantao Changxing Plastic Products Co. Ltd. An employee phone, said the price is 2 yuan / only, very expensive, you want? If need to transport, plus transportation fee of 3 cents /.
“我们希望政府能够统一定价，规定零售价和市场价的上限，有利于指导厂家加大生产，否则这个价格炒作会离谱，市场也会更加混乱，现在不是发国难财的时候。
"We hope the government will fix a unified price and set a ceiling on the retail and market prices so as to help guide manufacturers to increase production. Otherwise, this price speculation will be outrageous, the market will become more chaotic and this is not the time for China to become rich.
”王义称。
"said Wang.
多位口罩厂商表示，目前疫情高度紧张情况下，希望地方政府能够引导中小微企业生产而不是一刀切的关闭。
A number of mask manufacturers said the current situation of high tension, hope that local governments can guide MSMEs production rather than a one-size-fits-all closure.
从生产角度来说，民用口罩虽然没有医用口罩要求标准那么高，但是在民用领域，如果民用口罩也使用高效率滤材，可以起到和医药口罩一样的防护效果。
From the production point of view, although not as high as the medical mask requirements, but in the civil field, if the civilian mask also use high-efficiency filter, can play the same protective effect as medical masks.
在资源高度紧缺的情况下，政府引导鼓励民用口罩生产商加工生产，甚至可以进驻厂区监督生产。
In the face of severe resource constraints, the Government encourages manufacturers of civilian masks to process and produce, and may even be stationed at factories to supervise production.
