普通人的个人记述，即使其中夹杂着恐惧和不安，也能通过这种熟识感带给人心以安慰，我们可以通过它指引的熟悉的路径，在这场危机中找到自己身心的避难所。
The personal accounts of ordinary people, even if mixed with fear and uneasiness, provide comfort through this familiarity, and through the familiar paths it guides, we can find a refuge in this crisis, both physically and mentally.
全文4871字，阅读约需9.5分钟当疫情降临时，每个人都被迫卷入其中，病痛会折磨患者的身体，但对那些未感染的普通人来说，疫情也凶暴地打断了自己有规律的日常生活，让社会瞬间进入非常状态。
When the epidemic strikes, everyone is forced into it and the illness can afflict the body, but for the uninfected, the epidemic violently interrupts their daily routine, leaving society in a state of emergency.
如何应对疫情给日常生活造成的突如其来的危机，后人只能求助于前人的经验。
How to deal with the outbreak of daily life caused by the sudden crisis, posterity can only turn to the experience of predecessors.
在这时，普通人的个人记述，即使其中夹杂着恐惧和不安，也能通过这种熟识感带给人心以安慰，我们可以通过它指引的熟悉的路径，在这场危机中找到自己身心的避难所。
At this time, ordinary people's personal accounts, even if mixed with fear and uneasiness, can bring comfort through this familiarity, and through the familiar paths it guides, we can find a refuge in this crisis, both physically and mentally.
但普通人记述的意义，又不仅仅是充当后来者的经验和安慰剂，更具有历史的意义。
But the significance of ordinary people's accounts, and not only as a latecomer's experience and placebo, more historic significance.
它不仅是一份时代的见证，更能通过字里行间的细节，从普通人的底层视角，对历史进行重新的审视和解读。
It is not only a witness of the times, but also through the details between the lines, from the perspective of ordinary people at the bottom, re-examine and interpret history.
从这一角度来说，普通人面对灾难时的私人记述，已经超越了个体经验的意义，具有了普遍性的价值。
From this point of view, ordinary people in the face of disasters in the private account, has gone beyond the significance of individual experience, has a universal value.
作为一个时代的见证，也是一份重要的历史文本。
As a witness of the times, it is also an important historical text.
将不同时代的灾难下的个人记述排列起来，我们会清晰地看到一条人类在与灾难搏斗、抗争中不断积累经验，跋涉前行的时间线。
By arranging the personal accounts of the disasters of different eras, we can clearly see a time line in which man has accumulated experience and trudged on in the struggle against disaster.
下面这份日记，也是一位普通人的记述。
The following diary is also an account of an ordinary person.
当冠状病毒肺炎疫情在武汉突然爆发时，他就住在距离病毒发源地之一华南海鲜市场仅10分钟车程的地方。
When the outbreak of coronavirus pneumonia erupted in Wuhan, he lived just 10 minutes from one of the virus's birthplaces, the South China Seafood Market.
他目睹了疫情的猝然公布是如何将一座沉浸在春节将至喜庆氛围中的名城都会，瞬间变成一座寂静的封闭之城。
He saw how the sudden release of the epidemic transformed a famous city, immersed in the festive atmosphere of Spring Festival, into a silent, closed city.
他见证了赶在封城前逃离城市的人群，在药店抢购口罩和消毒液的大妈，大年初一空空荡荡的街道。
He witnessed crowds fleeing the city ahead of the city, buying masks and disinfectant in pharmacies, the empty streets on New Year's Day.
紧张，有的；焦虑，也是有的。
There are tensions, there are anxieties, too.
但如果你将这份记述与三个半世纪前的瘟疫时代的个人记述相比，你会很容易发现一种理智与平和。
But if you compare this account with the personal account of the plague three and a half centuries ago, it is easy to find a sense of reason and peace.
有的只是紧张中的盘算和焦虑中的谨慎，以及一种理智的等待：瘟疫终将过去，瘟疫必将过去，我们会好好儿活下来，并把它记录下来，告诉每一个人，我们是如何度过并战胜了这场灾难。
There is only prudence in the midst of calculation and anxiety, and a rational wait: the plague will pass, the plague will pass, we shall live well, and record it, and tell everyone how we have weathered and conquered it.
（导语撰写：李夏恩）撰文|徐晏清2020年1月23日，农历腊月二十九封城当日，壮士断腕凌晨2时许，我刚关闭电脑准备回房休息，看见手机有推送的新闻，打开浏览，头条即让人睡意全消：“自2020年1月23日10时起，全市城市公交、地铁、轮渡、长途客运暂停运营；无特殊原因，市民不要离开武汉，机场、火车站离汉通道暂时关闭。
"Since 1000 hours on January 23, 2020, the city's city buses, subways, ferries and long-distance passenger services have been suspended from service. Without special reasons, residents should not leave Wuhan and leave Han passages at airports and railway stations.
恢复时间另行通告。
Recovery time will be announced separately.
”短短的文字看了3遍，心情紧张且惶惑，赶忙回房叫醒妻子告诉她这个消息，她也惊讶的一时语塞。
After reading the short words three times, she was nervous and confused and hurried back to her room to wake her up and tell her the news.

我们知道封闭武汉这座一千多万人口的特大城市肯定是天大的事件，1998年特大洪水时，国家宁可别处分洪也要“保卫大武汉”。
We know that the closure of Wuhan, a mega-city with a population of more than 10 million, was certainly a great event, and that the State would have preferred to have its flood control extended elsewhere in 1998.
此时身为武汉人，我们第一次真正感觉到事态的危急，之前总觉得几十上百个人的感染，对于一千多万人口的总量来讲似乎也不算什么，况且本地新闻说了“可防可控，不会人传人”。
As Wuhan people, we really feel the crisis for the first time, always feel tens of thousands of infected people, for the total population of more than 10 million people seems to be nothing, and the local news said that "can be controlled, no one will transfer.
即便病毒发源地华南海鲜市场离我家才6公里，坐车10分钟就能到，也没有引起我们多大的重视，更别说恐慌。
Even if the seafood market in South China, where the virus originated, is only 6 kilometers from my home, we can get there in 10 minutes by car.
所以大家并没有感到异常，我们像往年一样去各个商场超市采购年货，一如既往地推着婴儿车带着孩子去中山公园玩儿童玩具。
So we didn't feel unusual. As usual, we went to shopping malls and shopping for new year goods, pushing the stroller to take our children to play with children's toys in Zhongshan Park.
看到封城的消息才让我们深刻地认识到武汉乃至全国的这次新型冠状病毒爆发形势十分严峻，用专家的话说是刻不容缓，壮士断腕。
Seeing the news of the closure of the city only let us deeply realize that Wuhan and even the national situation of the new coronavirus outbreak is very serious, to use the expert's words is urgent, Zhuangshi wrist.
当夜未眠，一边翻看手机上各种有关疫情的新闻，一边预想了很多情况和早起要做的事，心中又十分担忧家人的健康情况，朋友圈里有段子说“全国认为得肺炎的地方是武汉，武汉认为得肺炎的地方是汉口……”网上流传的病毒危险程度图显示我们家的位置处于最危险的区域：汉口的中心。
"Wuhan is the country's place for getting pneumonia, and Wuhan thinks the place for pneumonia is Hankou..." The spread of the virus on the Internet shows that our home is in the most dangerous area: the center of Hankou.
早上6时赶忙翻身起床，把米桶冰箱橱柜都检查一遍，看看家里还缺些什么吃的用的，毕竟封城非同小可，料想短时间内不会解封，家里多存点物资更保险，把要买的东西记在手机里，戴上口罩下楼去采购。
After all, it is important not to be unsealed for a short time. It is expected that you will not be able to unpack your belongings. It is safer to record your purchases on your mobile phone, wear a mask and go downstairs for shopping.
在楼下看见有两个年轻的小伙子拎着行李箱往小区大门口跑去，估计是醒来得知封城的消息担心回不了家乡，所以想赶快搭车出城。
On the ground floor, I saw two young men with suitcases running to the gate of the neighborhood. I was afraid I would wake up and not be able to get back home.
虽然还没到封闭交通的时间，但是马路上的车辆已经明显少了很多，街上很多人在谈论封城的新闻，有的平静，有的激动。
Although it was not yet time for the closed traffic, the traffic was noticeably less on the road, and many people in the street were talking about the news of the city, some calm, some excited.
经过公交站时，看见不少戴着口罩提着行李的人朝车来的方向翘首盼望，有人紧张地打着电话，他们也都是还没回家的外地人吧，我能理解他们的心情，在外拼搏一年，谁不想回家团聚，但是武汉这么大，时间这么紧，形势又这么危急，怕是出不去了。
When passing the bus stop, I saw many people wearing masks and carrying luggage looking forward to the direction of the car, some people nervously called, they are also not home, I understand their feelings, who do not want to go home to reunite, but Wuhan is so big, time so tight, the situation is so critical that it is impossible to get out.
▲封城后的武汉街头。
Wuhan after the closure of the city.
首先去再买一些口罩和消毒用品，药店有专门的柜台卖防控物资，N99口罩29元一个，免洗的酒精洗手凝胶46元一瓶，好几位大妈可能觉得价格贵，或者不太接受这种“新样名堂”，都是选择传统的84消毒液，戴简单的一次性口罩，值得说明的是这一类物品都只收现金不能用医保，短短几分钟已经有好多人来抢购，余货所剩不多，我也赶紧选了一批口罩消毒液，又买了几袋板蓝根冲剂总共花了200多元。
First of all, to buy some masks and disinfectant supplies, pharmacies have special counters to sell control materials, N99 mask 29 yuan a bottle, alcohol wash-free gel 46 yuan, several women may think that the price of this kind of products is not very expensive, a few minutes have many people snapped up, not much left, I quickly picked up a batch of mask disinfectant, and bought several bags of Banlangen granules spent more than 200.
接着来到菜市场，摊位只有几家还在营业，卖菜的师傅说接到通知春节期间市场要消毒，三十中午关闭到初八才能恢复营业。
Then came to the Halles market, only a few of the stalls are still open, the chef said to be informed that the market will be disinfected during the Spring Festival, 30 noon until the resumption of business at 8.
我把胡萝卜、土豆、红薯、大白菜、菜薹、泥蒿这些便于存放的蔬菜每样买了好几斤，又去卖肉的摊位买了一些五花肉和肉末，价格较之前有上涨，可以接受。
I bought several kilos of easy-to-store vegetables like carrots, potatoes, sweet potatoes, cabbage, bolts and artemisia artemisia. I went to the butcher's and bought some meat and some flowers.
武汉历来春节头几天菜市场休息没菜卖，所以市民都会在三十之前存一些菜，一来自己吃，二来招待拜年的亲友。
Wuhan has always been the first few days of the Spring Festival market rest no vegetables sold, so the public will save some dishes before 30, on the one hand, to eat their own, and second, to welcome friends and relatives.
很多人家里也会腌制一些腊鱼、腊肉和香肠，只是去年猪肉大涨价，这些“腊货”比往年少了许多。
Many people have preserved salted fish, bacon and sausages as well, although the price of pork has risen sharply last year.
拎着几大袋物资刚回到家，连同家里的各种“腊货”、挂面、水果、零食大概生活7-8天不成问题，节约点维持10天也勉强。
When I arrived home with several large bags of wares, I didn't have a problem living for seven to eight days with all the wares, noodles, fruits and snacks at home.
不一会酒店的电话就打来了，对方说接到相关部门通知，配合防控，今年春节期间不营业，十分抱歉之前定的年夜饭无法提供服务了，定金可退也可以后消费抵扣。
Not long after the hotel phone call, the other side said that the relevant departments to cooperate with the prevention and control, this Spring Festival is not open, very sorry that the previous ordered dinner can not provide services, deposit can be refunded or after the consumption deduction.
赶忙给参加年夜饭的亲戚一一致电通知，大家都表示赞同和理解，毕竟生命健康更重要。
Hurriedly to participate in the dinner of relatives one by one call notice, we all expressed agreement and understanding, after all, life and health are more important.
中午，封城后的2个多小时，窗外二环线上只有私家车在穿梭，数量比平时少了一大半，本就多云的天空愈加阴沉，到下午竟飘起雨来，冷冷戚戚。
At noon, more than two hours after the closure of the city, the second ring outside the window only private cars in shuttle, less than half of the number of normal, the already cloudy sky more gloomy, in the afternoon to rain, cold and cold.

1月24日，农历腊月三十第一次感到周边人都像“躲瘟神”封城过后的十几个小时，阴雨还在继续，公布的感染和死亡人数越来越多，地域越来越广，各种不知真假的消息充斥着朋友圈和微信群。
On January 24, the thirtieth day of the Lunar New Year, for the first time, people around her felt like a "plague" over a dozen hours after the city was closed. Rain continued, more and more infections and deaths were being reported, more and more people were dying and more people were being told.
妻子的舅舅一家疫情爆发前带着孩子去海南旅游，现在买不了回武汉的飞机票和火车票，非常着急。
My wife's uncle before the outbreak of an epidemic with the children to Hainan travel, now can not buy back to Wuhan's air tickets and train tickets, very anxious.
他们说，现在外地对武汉人的恐慌和“排斥”让他们不知所措，酒店的服务员看到武汉人的身份证都不接待，还要上报，长这么大第一次觉得周边人对待自己好像是“躲瘟神”。
They said they were overwhelmed by the panic and "ostracism" surrounding Wuhan, and that the hotel attendants had to report that Wuhan people were not receiving their ID cards, and that for the first time since they had grown up, they felt as if they had been treated like a "plague.
只有电视里热热闹闹的节目告诉我们今天是年三十，不管怎么样年还是要过的，于是我又去采购了一些食物和水果。
Only the noisy TV show told us it was in our thirties, and I went shopping for some food and fruit anyway.
保洁阿姨在清洁楼道，空气里弥漫着消毒水的味道，小区的电梯口贴上了“发热市民分级分类就医流程图”，社区的公众号“微邻里”也在告知相应的应急方法，一张大而严密的防控网已经形成。
Aunt cleaning corridor, the air filled with the smell of disinfectant, the elevator mouth affixed with "fever citizens classification of the flow chart," the community's public "micro-neighborhood" also informed the corresponding emergency response, a large and strict control network has been formed.
解放大道的加油站私家车排起了长龙，每辆车最多只能加60元的油，开不了很远。
Private cars lined up at the gas station on Tahrir Boulevard could only add up to 60 yuan of oil per car, not far away.
新闻说过江隧道马上也要封闭，长江上的桥梁要测体温才能通过，武汉交通的局域网越来越小，亲友们都约定今年过年不拜年不走动，待在家里保平安。
The local area network of Wuhan traffic is getting smaller and smaller. The relatives and friends have agreed not to visit the New Year and stay at home to keep safe.
外地的很多朋友都在微信上焦急地询问我武汉现在的状况，“物价是不是大涨了”“吃的东西够不够”是大家最关心的问题。
Many friends from other places asked me anxiously in the micro-letter about the current situation in Wuhan, "prices have not increased greatly" "Enough food" is the most important concern.
同时也有很多朋友发来问候，一位北京的朋友说：“兄弟，我经历过非典知道你们的日子不好过，你要好好保重。
A friend from Beijing said, "Brother, I've been through SARS and I know your life is tough. Take good care of yourself.
需不需要口罩，我给你寄一些来……”这些鼓励在当下是那么的温暖人心。
Whether you need a mask or not, I'll send you some... "These encouragements are so warm in the moment.

His grandfather, in his 80s, had broken his thigh bone the year before, had a cerebral hemorrhage last year, and had been paralyzed in bed for more than two years.
因为担心从外面带去病毒，妻子家也选择都不接触老人，毕竟现在不幸去世的感染者中老年人居多。

His son was 2 1 / 2 years old when he was in the middle of the Spring Festival. He planned to visit his relatives and friends for the Spring Festival.
整个下午我用家里现有的材料精心烹饪了一桌年夜饭，花瓶中插上了年宵花，果盘里摆上了各色糖果和零食，沐沐很兴奋，小嘴说“糖果可以随便吃，过年真好！”不管什么时候，中国人最重要节日里的仪式感还是要有的。
All afternoon I cooked a table of Chinese New Year's Eve with the materials I had at home. The vase was filled with Chinese New Year's Eve flowers, and the fruit plates were filled with sweets and snacks.

Accompanied by the background of the Spring Festival Gala, our family of three people and enjoy the special Spring Festival dinner slightly desolate, enjoy small family reunion.
1月25日，农历正月初一哄抬物价和物资紧缺的传闻，看来不必担心彤云密布，风雨交加。
On January 25, the first day of the first month of the lunar calendar to raise prices and material shortages rumors, do not seem to worry about cloudy, stormy.
街头巷尾悬挂的大红灯笼提醒着人们今天是新年，但马路上行人寥寥，少许几个清洁工正在清扫落叶，街上的店铺都没开门。
The red lanterns hanging at the end of the streets were a reminder that it was New Year's Day, but there were few pedestrians on the road, a few cleaners sweeping up the fallen leaves, and the shops on the street were not open.
不少店铺门口贴上了“天佑武汉”“健康是福”等标语。
Many shops posted "God Save Wuhan" "Health is a blessing" and other slogans.
亲友都在微信群里发送拜年的文字和语音，大家最关心的是感染人数增加了多少，最担心的是一线医护人员是否防护安全，最期许的是家人都不要“中招”，大家反复叮嘱要戴口罩，勤洗手，少出门，转发着各类防控知识，晒着各自孩子们在小空间里玩耍的百态。
Most concerned about the increase in the number of infected people is whether the front-line health care workers are safe, the best hope is that the family will not "hit the road," people repeatedly asked to wear masks, wash hands, less out of the home, forward a variety of control knowledge, their children in the small space to play.

Indeed, now that my son sneezes, running his nose is such a trivial matter that it touches the nerves of the whole family.
小家伙太小，不愿意戴口罩，我只能选择坚决不出门，每天晚上他睡去后用紫外线臭氧消毒灯给屋子消毒。
The little fellow was too young to wear a mask, so I decided not to go out. He used ultraviolet ozone to disinfect the house every night.

Afternoon to the community downstairs to the 100 supermarkets, the door signs: "Public places, no mask can not enter, you are responsible to everyone.
”“商务局通知，营业时间10:00-17:00，承诺商品正常供应，绝不涨价，做好门店清洁、消毒及通风工作……”看到这些放心了许多，网上流传的哄抬物价和物资紧缺的传闻看来不必担心。
"The Commerce Bureau has informed it that it is open from 10: 00 to 17: 00 to promise a normal supply of goods without any increase in prices, and to clean, disinfect and ventilate the stores."
▲超市门前的公告。
A notice in front of the supermarket.
1月26日，农历正月初二从手足无措到安静等待，病毒终会离开从今天零点开始，三镇私家车未经特许禁止上路，进一步阻止人员的交叉感染，这可能是1949年武汉建市以来三镇第一次这么疏远，同时，湖北省各城市也开始封城。
On January 26, the second day of the first month of the lunar calendar, from panic to quiet waiting, the virus will eventually leave. From 0 pm today, private cars in three towns will be banned from the road without special permission, further preventing cross-infection, possibly for the first time since Wuhan was founded in 1949.
新闻上报道全国确诊感染人数1975例，死亡56例，其中武汉1052例，死亡52例，感染和死亡人数的大量上升，进一步刺激我们紧张的神经，朋友圈里都是各个医院人满为患，医疗防护用品短缺的告急，医生崩溃痛哭的视频让人触目惊心。

小道消息和官方信息同时都在刷爆我们的眼球，身边有朋友的微信疑似转发信息被封。

汉阳郊外火神山和雷神山两座医院也在紧张施工，将收治更多的病人。

虽然武汉的现状牵动着全国人民的心，阻隔了春节大家的团聚，但是坚强的武汉人什么没见过，明白任何困难都是暂时的，相信国家相信政府，这次的危机会和之前的大洪水、非典一样被战胜，太阳依旧会升起。
Although the current situation in Wuhan affected the hearts of the people throughout the country, blocked the reunion of the Spring Festival, but the strong Wuhan people have never seen anything, understand that any difficulties are temporary, believe that the state believes in the government, this crisis will be overcome as before the floods, SARS, the sun will rise.
▲分诊流程图回头看见小沐沐站在飘窗上看着外面空寂的二环线，我问他：“想不想出去玩？”他说“想”，我又问：“那能不能出去玩呢？”他说：“不能，外面有病毒。
I asked him, "Would you like to go out to play?" He said, "Would you like to go out?" He said, "Can I go out?" He said, "No, there is a virus outside.
”说完拿起玩具枪对我说：“爸爸，我要打病毒，消灭它。
"And with that he took his toy gun and said," Daddy, I'm going to kill the virus.
”夜来，持续的阴雨终于停了，窗外华灯闪烁，城市经雨水洗刷干净得发亮，空气极好，我戴上口罩到楼下去扔垃圾，不由自主走到街上，走过熟悉又陌生的寻常巷陌，交通信号灯倔强地指挥着空无一车的马路，四周万家灯火依然，只是静悄悄。
I put on a mask and went downstairs to throw rubbish. I could not help walking down the street, through familiar and unfamiliar streets, where traffic lights stubbornly commanded an empty road.
