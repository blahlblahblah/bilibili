父亲患病。
Father is ill.
父亲今年73岁，有高血压和心脏病等基础病史，从1月28日住院到今天，已经整整11天，这也是我和母亲开始单独居家隔离的时长。
My father, 73, with a history of basic illnesses such as high blood pressure and heart disease, has been in hospital for 11 days since January 28, when my mother and I began to live alone.
我和母亲还有三天就可以解除居家隔离观察，而父亲的情况则并不让人乐观。
My mother and I are three days away from home isolation, and my father's situation is not encouraging.
。
.
父亲入院后的核酸检查为阴性，但医生认为这个并不作数，因为他的临床症状与胸片结果与新冠病毒肺炎高度吻合，所以他仍然作为疑似的重症患者被收治在武汉市中心医院，就是李文亮医生生前所在的医院。
He was admitted to Wuhan Central Hospital, the hospital where Dr. Li was living, as his clinical symptoms were highly consistent with those of the new crown virus pneumonia.
。
.
不知道他是怎么感染上的。
I don't know how he got infected.
1月19日他开始出现症状，但当时除了流涕和发冷以外，既没有发烧也没有咳嗽，所以他一直是将自己当作普通感冒在用药。
He began to develop symptoms on 19 January, but he had neither a fever nor a cough, except for a runny nose and chills, so he continued to treat himself as a common cold.
但他在1月21日来我家准备吃饭的时候，我发现到他的症状不对，并给他量了体温，体温是正常的，但我依然很坚决的将他劝离，同时家里开始通风杀毒。
But when he came to my house for dinner on January 21st, I noticed that his symptoms were wrong and took his temperature, which was normal, but I still strongly advised him to leave, and the family began ventilation and antivirus.
做完这一切，我开始出去购买药物，当时的情况下，药物虽然紧张，但好歹还是买到了奥司他韦和莲花清瘟这几种新冠病毒肺炎的常用药物。
After all, I started to go out to buy drugs, and under the circumstances, the drugs, though tense, were somehow available for the new crown pneumonia, oseltamivir and lotus rinderpest.
。
.
从那天开始，我始终心神不定，但我的父母根本不认为自己会得新冠病毒肺炎，回了家继续按照普通感冒在自己用药。
From that day on, I was restless, but my parents didn't think they were going to get pneumonia, so they went home and continued to take their medicine with the common cold.
转眼，就到了1月23日。
In a twinkling, it was January 23.
。
.
武汉封城。
Wuhan Seal City.
这是在建国以后从未发生过的事情，作为中部六省唯一的副省级省会城市，武汉拥有超过1400万的管理人口和1000万的常住人口。
It has never happened since the founding of the People's Republic of China. As the only provincial capital city in the six central provinces, Wuhan has a administrative population of more than 14 million and 10 million inhabitants.
。
.
在1400万的管理人口中，包括近120万的外地高校学生，和大量的在汉经商、务工人员，这些人主要包括20万的温州商人，以及近300万的孝感、黄冈、鄂州、黄石、宜昌、荆州、襄阳等湖北省各地级市人口。
The 14 million people in charge include nearly 1.2 million overseas college students and a large number of business and labor personnel in China, including 200,000 Wenzhou businessmen and nearly 3 million filial piety, Huanggang, Huizhou, Huang Shi, Yichang, Jingzhou and Xiangyang.
没办法，武汉一市的经济体量即占湖北省的四成，所以绝大多数的经济活动与人员都集中在了武汉。
Wuhan, the city's economic volume accounts for 40% of Hubei Province, so the vast majority of economic activities and personnel are concentrated in Wuhan.
。
.
要过春节了，他们要返乡。
They are going home for the Spring Festival.
事后我们才知道，这些人当中不少人身上戴着病毒，但封城之前离汉的他们并不知道，也没有戴口罩，因为他们觉得：不需要。
We later learned that many of these people had the virus on them, but they did not know about it and did not wear one before the siege because they felt they did not need it.
。
.
而绝大多数的武汉本地人，出于对这个城市本能的眷恋，在封城之际，选择了坚持、坚守和坚强。
The vast majority of Wuhan native people, out of this city instinctive attachment, in the closure of the city, chose to adhere to, adhere and strong.
。
.
也就是在这一天，父亲开始出现发热症状。
It was on this day that the father began to develop fever symptoms.
第二天就是大年三十了，原计划是不管如何，我们都要一起吃个年夜饭，一起穿件新衣，我当时想：这个年再难，也得过。
The next day is the New Year's Eve, the original plan is that no matter what, we will eat dinner together, wear a new clothes, I thought: this year, no matter how difficult, also have to pass.
但现在看来，情况不妙，我勒令父母在家也必须戴上口罩，并要求母亲马上将父亲关进自己的房间，不允许其离开房间半步，母亲将饭菜放在门口由他自取，并要求他们两人立即按照新冠病毒肺炎的药方开始用药。
But now, when I ordered my parents to wear a mask at home, and demanded that my mother immediately shut him up in her room and not allow him to leave the room, she left the food at the door for him to take, and asked both of them to start taking medication immediately in accordance with the prescription for Newcastle virus pneumonia.
。
.
大年三十到了，父亲的病情并未见好转，饭是不能过去吃了，但我和老婆孩子在自己家还是吃了一顿无比丰盛的年夜饭：所有的菜式都是我去母亲那里取回来的。
When the New Year's Eve arrived, my father's illness did not improve, the meal could not be eaten, but my wife and children in their own home or eat a very rich dinner: I went to my mother to pick up all the dishes.
本来这些菜是准备我们六个人吃两顿的，现在就给我们四个人吃了。
It was meant to be two meals for the six of us, but now it's for the four of us.
。
.
我今年43岁，经历过非典疫情，但从未有过这样惨淡的春节经历。
I am 43 years old and have experienced the SARS epidemic, but I have never experienced such a bleak Spring Festival.
但后面发生的一切，证明这只是我们这个家庭和武汉这座城市苦难的开始。
But what happened later proved that it was only the beginning of the ordeal for our family and the city of Wuhan.
。
.
父亲的求医之路。
Father's path to health care.
2020年1月25日。
January 25, 2020.
父亲的病情急转直下，高烧达到38.8度。
His father's condition deteriorated rapidly, with a high fever of 38.8 degrees.
仅仅一天，他已经基本失去了行动能力。
In just one day, he was largely incapacitated.
。
.
母亲很着急，但她严厉地拒绝了我要过去帮忙送医的打算，她的态度很明确：就算她和父亲都死了，也不许我踏入家门半步。
My mother was worried, but she sternly refused my offer to come and see the doctor. Her attitude was clear: even if she and my father were dead, I would not be allowed to step inside.
。
.
母亲根据市政府政令，去找了社区，希望能由社区派车送医，但社区表示此时没有车可以派去送医，这个情况先去找社区医院进行初检，由社区医院根据情况安排接诊的对口医院。
The mother went to the community by decree in the hope that the community would send a car to see the doctor, but the community indicated that there was no car available for transport at that time.
于是，母亲去了社区医院要求开转诊单，但社区医院告诉她，根据政令，病患必须本人来就诊，最后社区医院在病历上写下“请新华医院接收”，但是新华医院已经没有了床位。
As a result, the mother went to the community hospital to ask for a referral, but the community hospital told her that the patient had to come in person according to the decree, and finally the community hospital wrote in the medical record, "Please be admitted to Xinhua Hospital," but the hospital no longer had beds.
。
.
母亲决定，无论如何，要把父亲送到医院就诊。
The mother decided to take her father to the hospital anyway.
。
.
但是她没有汽车，也不会开车，只能打120求助。
But she doesn't have a car, she can't drive, she has to call 120 for help.
下午打的120，但需要送医的人实在太多了，到了晚上车终于来了，父亲已经没有了力气，在下楼的时候摔了一跤，然后大小便失禁。
120 in the afternoon, but the need to send too many people to the hospital, finally arrived at night, the father has no strength, in the downstairs when the fall, and then incontinence.
。
.
武汉市第六医院接诊了父亲，同时还检查了母亲。
Wuhan Sixth Hospital received his father and also examined his mother.
母亲的情况一切正常，但父亲的情况很不好：肺部间质性感染，血项指标和新冠病毒肺炎症状高度吻合，医生说超过九成就是新冠病毒肺炎，但他们没有核酸检测能力，并且根据市政府防疫指挥部的政令，他们不是发热定点接收医院，医生建议父亲去十一医院进行收治。
The mother's condition was normal, but the father's condition was very poor: the pulmonary interstitial infection, the blood indicator was highly consistent with the New Crown Virus pneumonia, doctors said more than 90 per cent were New Crown Virus pneumonia, but they did not have nucleic acid testing capacity and, according to a decree of the municipal cordon sanitaire, they were not hospitalized at fever sites.
。
.
我的母亲从香港路步行回到青年路的家中，骑上她的电动车，在这个风雨交加的夜晚，独自一人将父亲送到了武汉市十一医院，也是武汉市首批定点发热医院之一。
My mother walked back to her home on Youth Road and got on her electric bike. On this stormy night, she took my father to Wuhan No. 11 Hospital, one of the first designated fever hospitals in Wuhan.
。
.
在排了几个小时的队以后，凌晨时分父亲终于看上了病，医生认为他是重症患者，但医院已经没有床位，医生给他开了住院证明，先登记上，等到有床位的时候再安排收治。
After several hours of queuing, his father finally fell in love in the early hours of the morning. The doctor thought he was seriously ill, but the hospital had no beds.
。
.
1月26日凌晨六点，父亲打完针，母亲骑着电动车，在寒冷的夜里和父亲一起回家，他们只戴了口罩，除此以外，什么防护都没有。
At 6 a.m. on January 26, my father finished his injection. My mother rode an electric car and came home with her father on a cold night. They only wore masks.
。
.
2020年1月26日。
January 26, 2020.
我是家里的独子，独子的好处是从小到大，我的父母只宠爱我一个，但当这个家庭发生困难时，除了我没有可以依靠的壮劳力了。
I was the only child in the family, the only advantage is from childhood, my parents dote on me, but when the family difficulties, except I have no strong labor to rely on.
。
.
所以，我必须要站出来，因为到了这一天，我的父亲行动已经非常不便，单靠我母亲照顾他是不行的。
So I had to stand up, for by this day my father was too inconvenient to move, and my mother could not look after him alone.
。
.
我要陪着父亲去就医，哪怕被感染，也得一家人一起面对生死，我不能抛下父母而独自苟活。
I will accompany my father to a doctor, even if infected, also have to face the life and death of the family, I can not leave their parents and live alone.
。
.
我的老婆、孩子、包括我的老丈人，都支持我的决定，他们一起给母亲做工作，让母亲同意我去陪护我的父亲，然后开始为我进行单独隔离的准备。
My wife and my children, including my father-in-law, supported my decision to work with my mother, to get her to agree to accompany my father, and then to begin preparations for my isolation.
最终，我的母亲不得不勉强答应了。
In the end, my mother had to give in reluctantly.
。
.
此时，武汉政府已经下令禁止私家车通行，但我们实在是没办法了：社区没有车可以派去送病患，120又实在等不起，所以我强行开车去把父母送到了武汉市十一医院，我想进医院陪父亲去打针，但母亲拒绝了，她说家里还有两个孙子，我要保重好自己，同时她给我安排了任务，让我去社区，去新华医院，去六医院，总之要找病床。
At this time, Wuhan government has banned private cars, but we really can not do: the community has no cars to send to send patients, 120 can not afford to wait, so I forced to drive to Wuhan City 11 Hospital, my mother refused, she said there are two grandchildren, I took care of myself, she arranged for me to go to the community, to Xinhua Hospital, to six hospitals, in short, to find beds.
。
.
然后我就去了社区医院。
Then I went to the community hospital.
。
.
社区的工作人员就坚守在社区医院，而社区医院的医生整个上午，没有喝过一口水，因为排队的人太多。
The community workers stayed at the community hospital, where the doctors did not drink a sip of water all morning because there were too many people in the queue.
。
.
社区的工作人员之前就告诉我，按照今天最新的政令，我的父亲只能转诊到协和医院，可是协和医院不是定点发热医院，只能接诊，不能收治，建议我和社区医院协调一下，能不能直接开转诊单去我父亲现在就诊的十一医院。
The community workers had told me that, according to the latest decree of today, my father could only be referred to Concorde Hospital, which is not a sentinel fever hospital, but only for consultations and treatment, and I was advised to coordinate with the community hospital whether I could make a referral directly to the eleven hospitals where my father is now attending.
。
.
终于等到我了，我把情况向社区医院的医生介绍了，医生听了我的情况以后很同情、理解，但是她没有权力开转诊单去十一医院，为了我的事情她们反复和上级协调沟通，但没有办法，我还是只能去协和医院，我感谢了她们，我能感受到她们的无奈，但我理解。
Finally, when I arrived, I introduced the situation to the doctor at the community hospital, who was sympathetic and understanding after hearing my case, but she did not have the authority to issue a referral form to the eleven hospitals.
。
.
我去了协和医院发热门诊，结果和社区工作人员说的情况完全一致。
I went to the Heating Clinic at Concorde Hospital and the results were consistent with what the community workers said.
我不死心，又去了新华医院挂号，拿着社区医院头天写的病历，要求收治，医生很理解，但也告诉我：确实是真没床位了，什么时候有床位能出来，她也不知道。
I did not give up, and went to Xinhua Hospital to register, with the community hospital written the day before to request admission, the doctor understand, but also told me: really no beds, when there is out of bed, she did not know.
。
.
我到处打电话求助，但此刻我发现，原来整个武汉的情况已经糟糕到让我难以想象，能有医院看病就不错了，哪来的病床？而且按照我父亲的情况，依据武汉市颁布的政令，我的父亲除非去协和就诊，然后再由协和开具转院通知，再到转院所在医院再次就诊挂号排队，我的父亲才有可能被收治。
I called around for help, but now I found out that the whole Wuhan situation was so bad that I could hardly imagine that I could have a hospital, where the hospital was good.And in my father's case, according to the Wuhan decree, my father could be admitted only if he went to Concorde and was notified by Concorde to the hospital for another registration.
但是我的父亲的身体情况，已经根本不允许他再这么折腾，再这么折腾，只会让他加速死亡。
But my father's health would not allow him to toss about any longer, and to do so would only hasten his death.
。
.
我开始感到绝望，整个人变得气急败坏。
I began to feel desperate and my whole person became angry.
。
.
2020年1月27日。
January 27, 2020.
父亲打了两天针，但并没见好转。
Father gave the injection for two days, but it didn't get any better.
。
.
今天还是只有去十一医院继续打针，我不管我妈的阻拦，我要陪他进医院。
Today is only to go to 11 hospitals to continue injection, I do not care about my mother's obstruction, I will accompany him to the hospital.
我很害怕，怕每一分钟不在他身边，就可能是永别。
I was so afraid that if I wasn't there every minute, I might be gone forever.
。
.
这是我第一次在疫情时期进入定点发热医院，虽然我之前做了心理建设和准备，但当我进入医院大门的时候，我还是感觉到血往头上涌，整个人处于一种晕眩感和无力感当中，当时我的腿就软了，差点一屁股坐在地上。
It was the first time I had been admitted to a sentinel fever hospital during an epidemic, and although I had been mentally building and preparing myself, I felt the blood rush to my head as I entered the hospital gate, a feeling of dizziness and powerlessness that made my legs soften and nearly sat on the floor.
。
.
还好我看见了医院里面的医护人员，她们都很镇定，也非常有耐心，让我从吓得半死的状态中清醒了过来。
Fortunately, I saw the hospital staff, they are calm, but also very patient, let me from the state of scared half dead.
。
.
父亲已经不能坐着打针了，我们陪他在三楼输液室打针，他的运气还不错，三楼有一个房间里面有两张床位，里面是夫妻两个人，两个人都感染了肺炎，但是看到父亲的症状比较重，本来躺着打针的丈夫让出了床位，让我的父亲可以躺在床上打针。
My father was no longer able to sit in the infusion room and we gave him an injection. He was lucky to have two beds on the third floor. There was a room on the third floor for two people, both of whom had pneumonia.
我很感激，也很感动。
I am very grateful and touched.
。
.
然后我下到一楼，再次将父亲的相关信息进行了住院登记，并反复核实，事后看来，这次登记很重要。
Then I went down to the first floor, registered my father's information again and checked it over and over again. In hindsight, the registration was important.
。
.
打针的时间很长，一直持续到下午，针药还是有很大反应，打完针我的父亲已经不能动了，我们就让他躺着休息，他戴着口罩睡着了。
The injection lasted a long time and lasted until the afternoon, and there was a great deal of reaction from the injection. My father was unable to move after the injection.
。
.
晚上七点多，我回家取饭，一整天了，我和母亲也要吃点饭啊。
After seven in the evening, I went home to get some food. My mother and I were going to have some rice all day.
八点左右，我正准备离开小区，突然听到整个空旷无人的城市发出了巨大的声响：武汉加油。
Around eight o'clock, I was about to leave the community, suddenly heard the entire empty city issued a loud voice: Wuhan refueling.
还有的家庭打开窗户，播放《我和我的祖国》、《一条大河》，更多的人是在高唱国歌。
Other families open their windows and play "My Country and Me," "A River," and more people are singing the national anthem.
。
.
从武汉封城到这天为止，已经4天。
It has been 4 days since the city was sealed in Wuhan.
曾经热闹无比、充满活力的武汉，就象个奄奄一息的病人，别说车，路上连个人都看不见，这一切都让人感到很彷徨、煎熬，而对我这样的病患家属来讲，尤其艰难。
Wuhan, once so busy and full of vitality, is like a dying patient, not to mention a car, not even a person on the road to see, all these people feel very hesitant and agonizing, but for the sick family members such as me, particularly difficult.
当我突然听到整个城市的歌声时，我突然明白，这个城市和这个城市的人，依然对未来充满着希望，依然保持着独有的乐观，我们和这座生我养我的城市，依然还活着！我顿时不能自己，泣不成声，为了我，为了家人，为了这座城市以及每一个武汉人而感动不已。
When I suddenly heard the whole city singing, I suddenly understand that the city and its people, still full of hope for the future, still maintain their unique optimism, we and this life I raised my city, but still alive! I can not immediately themselves, sobbing, for my family, for the city and every Wuhan people moved.
。
.
就在这天晚上，武汉市发布了新的政令，在不断的动员下，全市新增了数以千计的病床。
Just this evening, Wuhan issued a new decree, in the constant mobilization, the city added thousands of beds.
。
.
我的父亲，由于人已经在医院无法行动，十一医院的医护人员破例允许他在医院门诊部的三楼输液室病床上过夜，并告诉我们今晚随时有可能会有床位出来，家属如果可能就在医院陪护他，虽然不能住院，但父亲只要有任何危险，你要相信我们不会见死不救的。
My father, unable to move about in the hospital, the hospital staff at hospital 11 exceptionally allowed him to spend the night on the third floor of the hospital's outpatient department and told us that there was a possibility of beds coming out tonight.
但作为家属，我们要担着被感染的风险进行陪护。
But as families, we have to bear the risk of infection to accompany.
。
.
对于我们来讲，还有什么选择吗？我和母亲已经抽空去了一趟六医院，因为政令上已经明确了六医院也作为定点发热医院了，会有500张床位出来，但我们去了以后，发现还是没戏，因为等着住院的人实在是太多了。
My mother and I had taken the time to go to six hospitals because the decree had made it clear that six hospitals would also be designated as fixed-point fever hospitals, with 500 beds coming out, but after we had gone, it turned out that there were too many people waiting to be hospitalized.
。
.
我们别无选择。
We have no choice.
我和母亲决定，今晚无论如何，就陪在父亲身边，就算感染了，全家也要在一起。
My mother and I decided to stay with my father tonight, no matter what, even if it was infected, the whole family would be together.
。
.
当天夜里凌晨，武汉市中心医院后湖院区经过紧急改造，具备了收治新冠病毒肺炎病人的能力，于是我的父亲被紧急转院至后湖院区。
In the early hours of the night, my father was transferred to the Houhu courtyard of Wuhan Central Hospital after an emergency renovation that enabled him to treat patients with Newcomovirus pneumonia.
在这里要对十一医院的医护人员表示感谢，他们做到了最大程度的公平，由于等待转院的病患很多，他们是当着我们的面一个个打电话给病患家属确认是否能在40分钟以内将病患送到医院来转院的，而且是按照先转急诊再转门诊的顺序依次通知。
We would like to express our gratitude to the hospital staff at hospital No. 11, who have done their utmost to ensure fairness by calling their families in front of us to see if patients can be transferred to hospital within 40 minutes, in the order in which they are referred to the emergency first referral clinic.
。
.
我的父亲很幸运，当夜即被转往中心医院。
My father was lucky to be transferred to the central hospital that night.
但有些人因为实在来不及，错过了这次转院，至于他们后来是否被收治，我不得而知。
But some of them missed the transfer because it was too late, and I don't know if they were admitted later.
。
.
我将母亲送回家中，然后自己回家单独隔离，此时是1月28日凌晨4点。
I took my mother home and went home alone, at 4 a.m. on 28 January.
。
.
我将家里仅存的一点酒精对自己浑身上下，里里外外进行消杀，然后洗澡上床，时间指向凌晨5点。
I took the only alcohol left in the house, killed it all over my body, inwardly and outwards, and took a bath and went to bed at 5am.
。
.
隔离。
Isolation.
父亲住院后，我和母亲自然要进行单独隔离。
After my father was in hospital, my mother and I naturally had to be isolated.
。
.
但实际上，我后来还去了好多次医院，主要是给父亲送药。
But in fact, I went to the hospital many times later, mainly to send medicine to my father.
政府规定我父亲的这种情况，医药费全免，还管吃饭，但有些药不在医保用药清单上，得我们自己买。
The government ordered my father to be free of charge for medicine and meals, but some of the medicines were not on the Medicare list and we had to buy them ourselves.
这类肺炎病人通常需要使用丙种球蛋白和血红白蛋白，我父亲的症状比较重，使用量是其他人的一倍，费用也不菲，一天需要5000元，但为了父亲能够好起来，在好心人的帮助下，我还是想办法给他买到了非常稀缺的药。
My father's symptoms are heavier, he uses twice as much as the rest of us, and the cost is five thousand dollars a day. But to make my father better, with the help of kind people, I managed to buy him very scarce medicine.
钱对我们来讲已经不重要了，此刻让父亲能活下去才是最重要的。
Money doesn't matter to us anymore. It's the most important thing to keep my father alive at the moment.
。
.
但我坚决不允许母亲再去医院了，她的精神状态和身体状态都不允许了，其实还包括心理状态。
But I firmly do not allow my mother to go to the hospital, her mental state and physical state do not allow, in fact, including the psychological state.
她一天要给自己量十几次体温，这已经是神经过敏了，老是觉得自己哪儿都不舒服，我和老婆、孩子每天和她打电话，视频聊天，让她的心能够舒缓下来，经过这一次磨难，我知道每个人心里都有一道坎。
She had to take her temperature more than a dozen times a day. She was so neurotic that she always felt uncomfortable anywhere. My wife and children and I called her every day and talked to each other on the phone.
。
.
其实我也是。
Actually I am too.
。
.
每天的隔离生活，我基本无心工作，也无法静心看书，每天都在关注疫情的发展与变化，期待武汉能够早点解除封城，期待和我的同事们早日重聚，期待这个城市能够恢复活力。
Every day, I have no intention of working or reading books, and I am looking forward to seeing Wuhan lift its blockade as soon as possible and to reuniting with my colleagues in the hope that the city will regain its vitality.
。
.
我不期待别的。
I don't expect anything else.
。
.
只要我的家人、同事、朋友，能够好好活下去，活到这个城市病愈的那天，我觉得我就很满足，我就很幸福。
As long as my family, colleagues and friends are able to live well until the day this city recovers, I feel satisfied and happy.
。
.
至于别的，对于我们来讲，不重要。
As for the rest, it doesn't matter to us.
。
.
希望与致敬。
Hope and homage.
2月7日，中央开始对李文亮医生的情况进行全面调查。
On 7 February, the Central Government began a comprehensive investigation into the situation of Dr. Li Wenliang.
。
.
这一天，全国的新增及疑似病例开始减少。
On that day, new and suspected cases began to decrease throughout the country.
。

武汉市经过不断动员，开设了11家方舱医院，这是全市的公务员不眠不休努力的结果，我认识不少公务员，他们真的很不容易，为了这座城市快点好起来，他们做到了自己能做的一切。
As a result of continuous mobilization, Wuhan has opened 11 cabin hospitals, which are the result of the tireless efforts of civil servants throughout the city. I know a lot of civil servants.
方舱医院的建立，终于让这座城市的人民不再那么恐慌。
The establishment of the cabin hospital finally put the people of the city out of their panic.
。
.
他们还征用了大量的酒店、学校甚至是党校，用来作为密切接触者进行集中隔离的观察点，我的同事就被隔离在其中一个地点，生活很好，除了不能出房门，伙食很好，生活无忧。
They have also requisitioned a large number of hotels, schools and even Party schools to serve as observation points for concentrated isolation for close contacts, and my colleagues have been isolated in one of the locations, living well, with good food and a secure life, except for not being able to leave the house.
。
.
为了这座城市还能有希望，公务员们已经顾不上自己的生死，而他们也已经到了生理和心理的极限。
Civil servants have lost sight of their own lives and have reached the limits of their physiology and psychology in order for the city to remain hopeful.
。
.
无论如何，我作为武汉人民的一份子，向武汉的公务员致敬。
Anyway, as a member of Wuhan people, I salute the civil servants in Wuhan.
。
.
是你们，让我们终于感受到了活的希望是值得期盼的。
It's you who have finally made us feel that the hope of living is something to look forward to.

2003年的非典疫情，我是亲历者，我万万没有想到此生还会碰上第二次这种疫情，并且比上一次更为严重。
I was a witness to the SARS epidemic in 2003, and I had no idea that it would happen again in this lifetime, much more so than in the last one.
不幸的是，病毒偏偏选择了武汉，但武汉有一群坚定的守护者，他们叫“最美逆行者”，实际上他们就是武汉的医护人员。
Unfortunately, the virus must have chosen Wuhan, but Wuhan has a group of determined guardians, they are called "the most beautiful inverse," in fact they are Wuhan medical personnel.
。
.
我父亲求医问诊的整个过程，我所见到的每一位医护人员，没有一个人回答问题是不耐烦的，虽然他们每天面对的病患数以百计，虽然他们的防护装备五花八门，还有人穿的居然是工业级防护服，但他们很镇定，至少让我感受到很镇定。
Throughout my father's visit, none of the paramedics I met was impatient to answer the question, although they faced hundreds of patients every day, despite the variety of their protective equipment and the fact that they were wearing industrial-grade protective clothing, but they were calm, or at least calm.
。
.
最后，我想说一说李文亮医生所在的武汉市中心医院，也是我父亲所在的医院。
Finally, I would like to talk about Dr. Li Wenliang's Wuhan Central Hospital, which is also my father's hospital.
。
.
因为是传染病，从2月5日起，医院不再允许家属探视。
Family visits are no longer allowed in hospitals as of 5 February due to contagious diseases.
我只能打电话给医生询问父亲的病情，就在今天早上，我和医生通话，他告知我，父亲的病情比较重，入院以后就已经下了病危通知单，他很无奈和痛苦地告诉我，这个病目前没什么好用的药，他的很多同事都感染并且是重症。
Just this morning, I spoke to the doctor. He told me that my father was seriously ill and that on admission he was in a critical condition. He told me in frustration and pain that there was no medicine for the disease and that many of his colleagues were infected and seriously ill.
。
.
在这场疫情之下，所谓的最美逆行者，只是用自己的生命去换取别人的健康，用自己的牺牲去换取这座城市的希望。
In this epidemic, the so-called most beautiful inverse, but with their own lives in exchange for the health of others, with their own sacrifice in exchange for the hope of the city.
。
.
向你们致敬，无他。
Hail to you. No one else.
。
.
结语。
Concluding remarks.
2020年的武汉，2020年的春节，终将成为这座城的回忆。
Wuhan in 2020, the Spring Festival in 2020, will eventually become the memory of the city.
。
.
我不知道自己是否可以活到这个城市病愈的时候，所以我记录下这段时间我与这座城市的回忆，这回忆，叫做城殇。
I don't know if I'm going to live to see the city recover, so I record the memories of this time with this city, this memory, called city war.
。
.
谨以此文祭奠疫情中的罹难者和李文亮医生。
I wish to pay tribute to the victims of the epidemic and Dr. Wenliang Lee.
