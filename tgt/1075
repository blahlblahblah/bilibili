”范曹军一边收集医护人员信息，一边召集志愿者司机。
Fan gathered information about medical workers and gathered drivers for volunteers.
由于路障等原因，司机无法去村里接人，他们便与医护人员约定，在收费站会合。

“（由于）没有交通工具，有一个护士步行13公里，来跟我们会合。

”将医护人员送至武汉后，志愿司机在返程时，还会帮助襄阳的医院运回物资。
After transporting medical staff to Wuhan, the volunteer drivers will also help the Xiangyang hospital bring back supplies on their way back.

”有的医护人员提出支付费用，车队司机就象征性地收50元。
"When paramedics offered to pay, the motorcade driver charged a symbolic $50.
“来回600多公里，一开始司机们都坚持免费，（后来）我建议他们收下这一天吃饭、喝水的钱。
"It was more than 600 kilometers back and forth. At first the drivers insisted on being free, and [later] I advised them to take the money for dinner and water that day.
