China's gaming industry under the New Crown: What's left of a brief revenue explosion? & # 160; & # 160; Video article on the industry's new crown: What's left of China's short-lived revenue explosion? Or will the game industry recover from the epidemic? Headless 2020-02-19.
收听本文19:52 受到新冠疫情影响，大部分行业都陷入了停滞，尤其是线下的第三产业行业，以饭馆，KTV，商场为首，这段时间可谓是愁云惨淡；电影行业和饭馆相比也差不多惨，上游拍摄剧组全停，下游影院电影撤档的撤档，影厅关闭的关闭，从上到下都陷入了危机之中。
With the New Crown hitting 19: 52, most industries have stalled, especially in the offline tertiary sector, led by restaurants, KTV and shopping malls. The film industry is in dire shape compared to restaurants, with the upstream crew completely shut down, downstream cinemas pulled out of gear, the closing of cinemas, and the crisis from top to bottom.
第二产业虽然没有第三产业那样遭遇滑铁卢，但是同样也遭受了不小的打击，主要是因为返乡工人很多都无法返岗，工厂也就不得不延迟开工。
The secondary sector, though not as hard hit by Waterloo as the tertiary sector, has also suffered, mainly because many of the returning workers have been unable to return to their jobs and factories have had to delay construction.
另外一方面，由于零售行业的需求降低，所以工厂本身的订单量也会受到影响。
On the other hand, orders from factories themselves will be affected by lower demand in the retail sector.
然而，在疫情之下，也有些行业看似好像是赚了钱，比如说物流行业，出不了门了，那理论上只能靠物流买东西了；比如说很多O2O行业，像是买菜APP，生鲜送货这些，由于大家都不敢去商场买菜了，那这些送菜的APP订单量狂涨。
However, under the epidemic, there are some industries that seem to be making money, such as logistics, which can't go out of business. In theory, they have to rely on logistics. For example, many O2O industries, such as buying vegetables APP and delivering fresh food, have seen their orders soar because people are afraid to go shopping.
说起来去年好几家这种送菜APP都因为现金流不足倒闭了，谁能想到再过一段时间就迎来了订单量暴涨呢。
When several of these delivery APPs failed last year because of insufficient cash flow, who would have expected a surge in orders in a matter of time.
同样DAU猛涨的还有抖音等一系列头条系的短视频产品，也很好理解，在家待着的时候就只能刷短视频了。
The DAU has also soared with a series of short video clips, such as Jitter, that are easy to understand and can only brush short videos while at home.
不过，如果我们抛除情感的因素，不去想什么“你们发国难财“的道德指责，最能够吃到这次疫情“红利”的貌似就是游戏行业了，在大家都出不了门的情况下，高DAU，高ARPU（用户平均付费）的游戏行业，在这次疫情中吃足了红利。
But if we let go of the emotional element and think about the moral accusation that you're going to get rich for your country, it looks like the gaming industry will get the most out of the epidemic. The game industry, with its high DAU, high ARPU (average user fee), is paying dividends from the epidemic.
大家在家没事做的时候，都会玩玩游戏，尤其是以腾讯系为代表的“社交”和“轻度”游戏，在这次的特殊假期，确实收割了一波特殊红利。
When people do nothing at home, they will play games, especially Tencent as a representative of the "social" and "light" game, this special holiday, indeed harvest a special dividend.
尽管如此，我们难道真的能够因此推断，疫情对游戏行业是一件好事吗？1大部分对于其他行业的影响，都是用2003年的非典肺炎作为对比的，由于非典肺炎的爆发时间和周期都与新冠有很大的相似之处，所以非典型肺炎对于第二产业以及部分第三产业都有着很大的参考意义。
But can we really infer that the epidemic is a good thing for the gaming industryMost of its impact on other industries was compared with SARS in 2003, because the SARS outbreak time and cycle are very similar to the new one, so SARS has great reference value for the secondary industry as well as for some tertiary industries.
但是，对于游戏行业，2003年的非典型肺炎并没有任何的参考意义，一来是因为2003年不仅移动互联网没有爆发，连互联网本身都还是在早期阶段，网购和线上电子支付都没有成型，二来则是因为2003年的游戏行业还是空中楼阁，端游还处于萌芽阶段，大部分所谓的游戏玩家也只是家里玩玩盗版PC游戏，游戏行业这种说法就根本不存在。
But, for the gaming industry, the Atypical Pneumonia of 2003 had no reference, either because mobile Internet did not break out in 2003, or even the Internet itself was in its early stages, or because the gaming industry of 2003 was still in its infancy, with most so-called players playing pirated PC games at home.
所以，到了2020年，一切都已经产生了很大的变化。
So, by 2020, everything has changed a lot.
我们再也不用像是非典那样在家无聊度日，互联网的进化让游戏行业乃至其他所有行业都产生了翻天覆地的变化，对于疫情的影响也不能用原来非典时期的方法来进行探讨。
We no longer have to live like SARS bored at home, the evolution of the Internet has caused the game industry and all other industries have undergone tremendous changes, the impact of the epidemic can not be used to explore the original SARS method.
在看这次疫情对于游戏行业的影响之前，可以先看看2019年整体的游戏行业变化。
Before looking at the impact of the epidemic on the game industry, look at 2019 in the overall game industry changes.
在版号开放之后，游戏行业终于迎来了一波回春。
After the release of the number, the game industry finally ushered in a wave of spring.
经历了2018年由于版号所导致的增速大幅度下滑之后，在2019年开放版号，部分限制版号之后，游戏产业比去年的增速有所上升，虽然和版号限制之前相比差的很远，但是至少有变好的趋势。
After experiencing a sharp decline in 2018 due to the release number, the game industry has grown faster than it did last year after 2019, when the number was partially limited, but at least there is a trend toward better.
有一句话叫做涨得快是因为起点低，大概是这个道理。
There is a saying called rising fast because the starting point is low, which is probably why.
在版号限制的大背景下，很多游戏公司都选择了先出海，再回归的政策，比如说今年吃足了春节+开服+买量红利的莉莉丝新作《剑与远征》就是先跑到海外赚够了钱，再回国以“海外玩家都玩疯了”的姿态回来疯狂买量，怪不得前一阵子莉莉丝发行负责人接受采访说：“我们发行没有秘诀”，确实没秘诀，砸钱就是了。
For example, Lilith's new book, Sword and Expedition, is just going overseas to make enough money and come back to China as "overseas gamers are crazy." No wonder we don't have a secret.
在这样的大背景下，中国目前的游戏行业基本处于赢家通吃的状态，也就是说越是大厂，越是有雄厚实力的开发商，发行商，版号紧缩的政策越是能抗住。
Against this background, China's current game industry is basically in a winner-take-all situation, meaning that the bigger the factory, the more powerful the developer, distributor, the more resistant the version-size policy will be.
他们旗下的产品多，预算足，在买量上毫不手软，也能等得起版号。
Their product is many, the budget is sufficient, in the purchase quantity is not flabby, also can wait for edition number.
越是小的厂商越容易在等待产品上市回血的时候被版号拖死。
The smaller the manufacturer, the easier it is to be dragged to death by Edition Number while waiting for the product to return to market.
前几天，央视财经发了一个“版号倒逼精品”的“搞笑”新闻，也引来了游戏行业无语嘲笑之声。
A few days ago, CCTV Finance issued a "version number inverted boutique" of "funny" news, also attracted the game industry speechless mockery.
毕竟把大部分都中小企业都拖死了，那留下来的也只能是精品了。
After all, most of the small and medium-sized enterprises have been dragged to death, that can only remain the boutique.
在这个时候这个特殊的春节来了，疫情的爆发让事情发生了变化。
At this time this special Spring Festival came, the outbreak of the epidemic let things change.
2每年的春节都是游戏厂商的兵家必争之地。
The Spring Festival is a must-have place for game manufacturers every year.
春节是中国除了国庆之外最长的假期，如果说国庆假期很多人还会选择出去旅游的话，春节假期大部分的家庭都会选择回到老家和家人团聚过年。
Spring Festival is China's longest holiday apart from National Day. If many people choose to travel during the holidays, most families will choose to return home and spend the New Year with their families.
回老家过年吗，大家都懂的，确实没什么事干，除了串门看亲戚聚会吃饭之外，年轻人剩下的时间就只能打打游戏度日了。
We all know that there is nothing to do, except to visit relatives to have dinner, young people have to play games for the rest of the time.
这也给了游戏厂商机会，春节期间会推出一系列拉收入和拉留存的活动，比如说去年腾讯《王者荣耀》的年度最高流水就在2019年的大年三十，流水达13亿元，2019年2月整月为71亿元。
This also gives gamers the opportunity to launch a series of income-pulling and retention activities during the Spring Festival. For example, Tencent's annual peak water flow in "The Glory of the King" was in 2019, amounting to $1.3 billion and February 2019 to $7.1 billion.
这一个月流水数大概可以把五六家二次元头部厂商全年的流水绑在一起吊着打。
This month the number of water may be five or six quadratic head manufacturers in the year-round water hanging together.
那么今年这个特殊的春节，流水增长到底是多少呢？根据“ 互联网与娱乐怪盗团”的统计，今年王者荣耀的大年三十单日流水为20亿元左右，这个流水大概打破了全世界的所有游戏的单日销售数据。
According to the Internet and Entertainment Strange Burglaries, the annual revenue for this year's Golden Jubilee is around 2 billion yuan, breaking the one-day sales figures for all games in the world.
但是问题来了，这和疫情又有什么关系呢?很多人在统计流水的时候，都会把这个《王者荣耀》的20亿单日流水拿出来说事，鸡贼一点的会直接拿出来1月流水统计说明疫情对于游戏行业是多么“利好”的消息，“不信你看《王者荣耀》大年三十一口气赚了20亿”，然而，这和疫情是没有任何关系的，不管有没有疫情《王者荣耀》的单日流水都会达到这个数字。
But the question is, what does this have to do with the epidemic? Many people use the two billion-day flow of "The Glory of the King" to come up with the news that January's statistics show how good the epidemic is for the gaming industry.
而且在1月25日的大年三十，除了武汉之外，全国大部分城市都还没有疫情的消息，远没有现在蔓延的广。
Besides Wuhan, most of the cities in China did not have the news of the epidemic, which is far from being widespread.
如果真的统计疫情对于《王者荣耀》的影响，那也应该是等到2月份的数据出来之后，一起进行统计。
If it is true to count the impact of the epidemic on The Glory of the King, it should wait until the February figures are available.
《王者荣耀》的流水吃没吃到假期红利？涨没涨？那肯定是涨了的。
Did "The Glory of the King" eat the holiday dividend? The rise did not rise? That must have gone up.
从QuestMobile的统计数据中，《王者荣耀》和《和平精英》的日活用户都在大年三十达到了峰值，在之后又回落到正常水平。
Daily users of both 'The Glory of the King' and 'The Peace Elite' peaked in their late 30s and then fell back to normal, according to QuestMobile statistics.
《王者荣耀》今年的活动依然以限定皮肤为主，但是和去年相比已经收敛了很多——即使如此，《王者荣耀》的流水数依然创下了历史。
"The Glory of the King" is still a skin-restricted event this year, but it has shrunk considerably since last year - even so, The Glory of the King is still running at a historic pace.
但是这并不是疫情导致的，这是春节假期的必然结果。
But this is not caused by the epidemic, which is the inevitable result of the Spring Festival.
那么，真的受到疫情影响最深的是什么呢？这次疫情对于有些游戏是撞大运撞上了，比如说棋牌类游戏，腾讯的《欢乐斗地主》，《开心消消乐》等微信小程序游戏，都在这次的疫情影响下，数据有所增长。
So what has really been most affected by the epidemic? Some games, such as board games, Tencent's "Pleasure Fighting Landlord" and "Happy Riddance," have seen an increase in data as a result of the epidemic.
这个很好理解吧？平常家里的长辈们能聚集在一起搓麻将打牌，现在只能在手机上面搓麻将了。
Rub the cards together! Rub the cards instead of rubbing them all over the top of their cell phones.
所以，在这波疫情的影响下，用户年龄层高的棋牌类游戏获得了不少的红利。
Therefore, under the impact of this epidemic, users of high-age chess games have received a lot of dividends.
另外，休闲游戏也受到了疫情很大的影响。
In addition, leisure games have also been affected by the epidemic.
他们的主要投放渠道都是来自于抖音短视频平台，或者今日头条这种资讯分发平台。
Their main delivery channels are from the chatter short video platform, or today's headlines such as the information distribution platform.
在这次的疫情影响下，这些平台的DAU也上涨了，同时也为了免费游戏的下载大量带量。
As a result of the epidemic, the DAU on these platforms has also risen, as well as the number of downloads of free games.
在讨论疫情对于游戏的影响的之前，要先说明一下目前市场上的游戏产品无非就是两种，一种是DAU高，ARPU低，比如像是《王者荣耀》，《欢乐斗地主》，《和平精英》这些，另一种则是DAU低，ARPU高，大部分的二次元游戏和策略类游戏都属于这种。
Before discussing the impact of the epidemic on the game, let's first explain that there are no more games on the market than DAU high and ARPU low, such as The Glory of the King, The Glorious Landlord, the Peace Elite, and low DAU, ARPU-high, and most quadratic and tactical games.
这次疫情对于前者是一次机遇，但是对于后者来讲，虽然DAU也会有一定的增长，但是没有准备好活动的游戏而言，并没有那么大的红利。
The outbreak is an opportunity for the former, but for the latter, while the DAU will grow somewhat, there is no big dividend for games that are not ready to play.
比如说去年大火的《明日方舟》，这次的春节只是按照寻常的春节活动，做了一波拉流水的卡池活动，没有在春节期间做任何的实质性的游戏内活动，几乎没有能够吃到疫情的任何红利。
For example, last year's fire "Ark of Tomorrow", the Spring Festival is just a normal Spring Festival activities, do not do any real in-game activities during the Spring Festival, can hardly eat any dividends from the epidemic.
除了《阴阳师》和《崩坏3》之外，几乎全部为高竞技类游戏看起来，这次疫情对于游戏行业是一针强心剂，虽然我们不可能将疫情当作什么“利好”消息，但这个特殊的春节假期对于游戏行业的短期增长的确起到了很大的作用。
With the exception of Yin Yang and Crumble 3, almost all of which are high-powered games, the outbreak looks like a shot in the arm for the gaming industry, and while we can't think of the epidemic as good news, this particular Spring Festival has certainly contributed to the short-term growth of the industry.
尤其是对于社交类，竞技类的游戏来说，春节假期让他们用户回流，短期内有了不小的增长。
Especially for social, competitive games, Spring Festival allows them to return users, a short period of growth.
但是，如果我们从长线来看，这次疫情对于中国的游戏行业真的是一件好事吗？3.我们回到一开始的问题，如果没有发生这次疫情，游戏行业是什么样？以我们前文的推断可以看出，大的游戏开发商，发行商能够依靠自有业务的输血，而活下去，甚至活的越来越好。
But if we look at it in the long run, is this really a good thing for the Chinese gaming industry3.We go back to the original question of what the game industry would have been if the outbreak had not happened.
而小的游戏开发商，发行商都会因为版号政策而被拖累现金流。
And small game developers, publishers will be because of the version of the policy and will be a drag on cash flow.
整个市场会进入一个寡头垄断的情况，创新会逐渐减少，游戏行业会越来越紧缩。
The whole market will enter an oligopoly, innovation will diminish, and the game industry will tighten.
那么发生了疫情之后怎么样了呢？我们可以看到高社交属性，低ARPU，高DAU的游戏在这次的疫情假期之后获利了，他们的DAU随着假期的延长，而获得了超出平常假期会有的DAU增长。
So what happens after the outbreak? We can see that the high-social, low-ARPU, high-DAU games have profited from this epidemic holiday, and their DAUs have gained more DAU growth than would otherwise have been the case with the extended holidays.
同时，用户日均使用时间也加长了，而且这是在2019年的假期为7天，2020年的假期为10天的基础上所得出的数据，假期延长了，日均的使用时间还能有这么高的增长。
At the same time, the average length of user days has also increased, and this is based on the figures of 7 days in 2019 and 10 days in 2020, when the leave is extended and the average daily use time can increase by as much.
如果我们将这个春节假期推到2月9日，相信这次春节假期所带来的回流和DAU增长会更加吓人。
If we push the holiday into February 9, we believe that the reflux and DAU growth from this holiday season will be even more frightening.
另外一方面，低DAU和高ARPU的游戏没有吃到太多红利，也很难吃到红利，更何况大部分的这类游戏都在春节选择了拉流水而不是拉留存，选择拉留存的貌似只有《阴阳师》这么干了，所以这次收获也颇丰。
On the other hand, low-DAU and high ARPU games do not receive much dividends, and it is difficult to eat dividends, and most of these games choose to pull water rather than pull back during the Spring Festival.
最高情况下进入畅销榜前三名，不过比起来流水情况，《阴阳师》作为一个已经四年的老IP，还能够有这么高的用户活跃，这比流水更加难得。
The top three in the best-selling list, but compared to the running water situation, Yin Yang Division, a four-year-old IP, can still have such a high level of user activity, which is even more difficult than running water.
这里要说明一下，市场上的低DAU，高ARPU的游戏可以分为两种，一种是二次元抽卡游戏，典型的就是《FGO》，《明日方舟》这些，流水的高低和卡池有很大关系，用户基数虽然远不如社交游戏，但是抽卡价格高，单个玩家消费高；另外一种则是策略类SLG游戏和“传奇”类游戏，比如像是最近这段时间疯狂打广告的《三国志：战略版》，和之前的《率土之滨》很类似。
The low-DAU, high-ARPU games on the market can be divided into two categories, one is quadratic pumping game, typical is "FGO," "Ark of Tomorrow" these, the height of the water and the card pool, although far less expensive than social games, but high single player consumption, and strategic SLG games such as the recent mad ad campaign "Three Kingdoms: A Strategic Edition."
他们所目标的用户就是大R，比如那些煤老板，富二代，拆迁户，私营企业家，这些人很喜欢在游戏里面攻城掠地的感觉。
Their target audience is Big R, the coal bosses, the second-generation rich, the dispossessed, the private entrepreneurs who love the feeling of invading the city.
传奇类就不用说了，用户大家都懂。
Legends do not need to be mentioned, users all understand.
从目前的形式来看，我们可以分析出几点情况。
In its present form, we can analyze a few situations.
第一，DAU高的“社交竞技”游戏吃到的红利最多，但是这类型的游戏目前属于绝对的垄断地位——说白了，就是“吃鸡”和“农药”吃到了最大的蛋糕；第二，棋牌游戏吃到了第二大的蛋糕，他们获得了和平常相比更长时间的高DAU，赋闲在家的中老年人依靠着棋牌游戏安放自己无法出门聚集的灵魂；第三，休闲类免费游戏依靠着抖音的增长而寄生增长，拿到了第三大的红利；第四，高DAU的二次元游戏如果是以拉流水为主开的活动，那么这次基本上没吃到什么延长假期的红利。
First, the DAU-high "social game" receives the most dividends, but this type of game is now an absolute monopoly - in other words, "chicken" and "pesticides" eat the biggest cake; second, the second-largest chessboard game, they receive the third largest dividend from the growth of chessboard games.
所以，如果我们将“行业蓬勃发展，各类人才涌现，玩家选择越来越多“作为一个”游戏行业发展的好“的标准的话。
So, if we're going to have "a thriving industry and all kinds of talent emerging, players are increasingly choosing to" be a good "standard for the game industry.
那么这次的疫情对于游戏行业而言绝对算不上一件好事。
So this epidemic is definitely not a good thing for the gaming industry.
为什么这么说？社交竞技类的游戏不是小厂能够尝试的，没有一定的用户积累体量和渠道，小厂做这个就是一个死，这个东西国内基本上只有那么一个手也能数的清的几家公司能做。
Why say so? Social competitive games are not small factories can try, there is no certain amount of accumulation of volume and channels, small factories to do this is a death, this thing basically only one hand can count a few companies can do.
棋牌类游戏的短暂回流也不会带来太多的变化，只是短暂的一波人群而已——而且国内棋牌类游戏一样基本是寡头垄断。
Short-term returns from the game of chess will not bring much change, just a short wave of people - and the domestic game of chess is essentially an oligopoly.
免费休闲游戏所依靠的广告平台也同样就是那么几家，说白了基本上都是头条系的东西。
Free leisure games rely on the same advertising platform is also a few, basically is the first line of things.
唯一国内现在小厂还在尝试的垂直领域的游戏，在这次的疫情假期中并没有得到多少的好处。
The only game in the vertical field where small domestic factories are still trying has not benefited much this holiday season.
疫情已经发酵之后，游戏厂商也不敢再多做活动，难免会被人说发国难财的节奏。
After the outbreak has fermented, game manufacturers do not dare to do more activities, will inevitably be said that the rhythm of national wealth.
尤其以目前的国内手游玩家的环境而言，疫情的假期出活动，肯定会被人带节奏。
Especially with the current domestic handler environment, the outbreak of the holiday activities, will certainly be a rhythm.
另外，疫情的影响是长久而且深远的。
Moreover, the impact of the epidemic is long-lasting and far-reaching.
在推迟复工之后，大厂尚可以依靠大的体量，在做到社会责任的同时保证员工安全，推迟复工或者远程办公。
After postponing the resumption of work, large factories can still rely on a large volume of social responsibility while ensuring the safety of staff, delay the resumption of work or telecommuting.
但是中小企业，如果不得不推迟复工，势必会影响到第二季度的游戏活动和内容。
But small and medium-sized enterprises, if they have to postpone the resumption of work, will inevitably affect the second quarter of the game activities and content.
同时，依靠着高ARPU的SLG游戏，由于私营企业家，中年人士这些目标用户本身受到疫情的影响，消费力也有可能会有所下滑。
At the same time, depending on the high ARPU SLG game, middle-aged people, the target users themselves, are affected by the epidemic and are likely to experience a decline in spending power as a result.
最重要的是，第二季度的版号会不会由于政府部门的延迟复工而受到影响，这个仍然是一个未知数，如果版号一样受到了影响，那么对于游戏行业来说，这将会是一个雪上加霜的消息。
Most importantly, whether the second-quarter version will be affected by government delays remains an open question, and if the numbers are affected, it could be bad news for the gaming industry.
新产品会越来越少，我们可能依然要继续玩着三年前的游戏。
There will be fewer and fewer new products and we may still be playing the game we played three years ago.
仔细算算，《王者荣耀》是五年前的游戏了，《阴阳师》也已经有四年的寿命了。
Carefully calculated, "King of Glory" is a game five years ago, "Yin Yang Division" has four years of life.
去年全年看下来，除了《明日方舟》算是现象级的新游戏之外，我们还有什么新的爆款优秀游戏产品能玩吗？我好想当弟弟！任何一个健康的行业，都不应该由一两家公司来掌控着80%的市场，虽然中国人口多，任何小的垂直领域都可能成为爆款。
All through last year, apart from tomorrow's Ark being a phenomenal new game, do we have any new blockbuster products to play? I really want to be a brother! No healthy industry should have one or two companies in control of 80% of the market.
但是大头如果就是那么几个公司在玩的话，这个游戏市场，这个游戏行业谈不上健康，也谈不上发展。
But if that's what so many companies are playing with, this game market, this game industry is not healthy, nor is it development.
对于大公司而言，他们有着完善的工作流程，体系，也有着能够实现远程办公的强大的OA系统，而对于中小企业来说，即使是远程办公，也很难做到和真正开工一样的效率。
For large companies, there are well-established workflows, systems, and powerful OA systems that enable telecommuting, and even telecommuting for small and medium-sized enterprises is hardly as efficient as starting a business.
而在抗风险的能力上，中小企业更不会和大企业一样那么容易熬过去，大厂伤筋动骨，那小公司现金流一断，命可能就没了。
And in the anti-risk capacity, small and medium-sized enterprises and large enterprises will not be so easy to survive, large factories injured bone, that small cash flow broken, the life may be lost.
所以，这次疫情对于游戏行业即使在短期内会带来一波红利，但是长期来看只会给这个已经很脆弱而畸形的游戏行业雪上加霜。
So, while the epidemic may yield a short-term dividend for the gaming industry, in the long run it will only add to the already fragile and deformed industry.
不只是中国，不只是手游。
Not just China, not just hand-to-hand.
疫情对全球的主机，单机行业同样造成了影响。
The epidemic is also having an impact on the global mainframe and single-machine industries.
从硬件上来看，由于中国作为全球制作业结构中重要的一环，很多的海外硬件产品都是由中国进行生产加工的。
Hardware, because China is an important part of the global manufacturing structure, many overseas hardware products are produced and processed by China.
疫情的影响，导致中国的很多工厂不能迟迟开工，这也让包括任天堂的NS，苹果的iPhone在内的多个国外的硬件厂商下一季度的产品都受到了影响。
The impact of the epidemic, which has delayed the start of many factories in China, has affected many foreign hardware makers, including Nintendo's NS and Apple's iPhone, next season.
而且就算是单机游戏行业也同样有这方面的问题，中国有很多海外游戏的外包，众包公司，工作室，疫情导致他们的返工时间延长，从而影响到了海外游戏的上市时间——《天外世界》的NS版本就因此延期。
And even the single-player gaming industry has its share of overseas games outsourced, with crowd-sourcing companies, studios, and the epidemic extending their rework time, affecting the launch time of overseas games - delaying the NS version of "Outer World."
电竞市场同样受到了很大影响，包括OWL在内的多个赛事都宣布了延期或者择地举办。
The Atletico market has also been affected, including the OWL has announced a number of postponed or optional events.
中国电竞游戏市场在2019年本来有了很大的增长，因为此次疫情所导致的线下人流的减少，比赛的延期势必会对于电竞行业也产生不良的后果。
China's Atletico gaming market was already growing by 2019, as the epidemic led to a reduction in offline traffic, the postponement of the competition is bound to have adverse consequences for the Atletico industry.
最关键的是，经济的变化向来不会是独立变化，永远是牵一发而动全身的。
Crucially, changes in the economy will never be independent and will always be sweeping.
如果经济真的因为疫情下滑，短期内的DAU增长，并不会带来收入的增加。
If the economy does decline because of the epidemic, short-term DAU growth will not lead to an increase in revenue.
如果玩家没有钱了，他们自然不会掏钱在游戏上，如果工资都发不出来了，人当然不会选择看电影。
If players do not have money, they will not pay for the game, if the wages do not come out, people will not choose to see the film.
历史已经证明，世界上不存在一个反趋势的行业，所谓的反趋势都是投资者为了吹捧所创造的伪机遇。
History has proved that there is no anti-trend industry in the world and that the so-called counter-trend is the false opportunity created by investors to glorify it.
只有整体的经济发展稳定，消费增长，才能让某个个体行业变好。
Only when the overall economic development is stable and consumption increases, can an individual industry become better.
但是，也无需悲观，疫情终究会过去，这个过程对于很多人来说是痛苦而漫长的。
But there is no need to be pessimistic, the epidemic will eventually pass, the process for many people is painful and long.
有没有什么机遇？还是有的。
Are there any opportunities? There are still some.
对于目前的情况来看，如果是普通的游戏开发者，也许这是一个进入单机游戏行业的相对好的时机。
For now, if you're a regular game developer, maybe this is a relatively good time to get into the single-player game industry.
单机游戏受制于行业的环境变化相对没有手游那么强，尤其是面向Steam的单机游戏，大部分都可以自己搞自己的，然后找到好的时机做纯粹的线上推广发行。
Single-player games are subject to industry changes less than manual games, especially for Steam, and most of them can do their own, and then find a good time to do pure online distribution.
如果是独立游戏的开发者，现在也许正是比较好的时间点，完善自己的游戏，尽早的进入发行流程。
If you are the developer of independent games, it may be a good time to improve their game, as early as possible into the release process.
无论冬天多么漫长，春天总是会到来的。
No matter how long the winter is, spring will come.
当春天到来的时候，那些冬天无法释放，被压抑的消费情绪也许也会爆发，那时候说不定真正的机会终于才会到来。
When spring arrives, when those winters cannot be released and pent-up consumer sentiment may erupt, the real opportunity may finally come.

至于某些高端人士所热爱的国产日式手游也是主要在靠人设（或者明说，立绘，甚至是XX立绘）来吸引玩家，而不是把心思放在好好的搞一个好玩的游戏上，少数能成为爆款的就是作为游戏本身的质量还算过关，而且同类玩法中也没有拿得出手的竞争对手……19回复・举报暗杀与色素  RusherJe・2020-02-19但是很多时候我就是想养个漂亮的电子羊，每天上去拿两把刀塔之间的间隔点一点就完事了，说白了还是需求不同2回复・举报RusherJe  暗杀与色素・2020-02-19我的观点就是这种需求就是现在国内这类游戏玩家的第一需求，而不是这游戏本身多好玩多有新意0回复・举报暗杀与色素  RusherJe・2020-02-22但是你提的两个例子在我看来有一个根本性的缺陷：就是它们其实并不适合手机，是这两个游戏本身具有强的游戏性而不是作为手游的这两个游戏具有强游戏性；在我看来一定要追求新意的话应该是要去尝试契合手机的特性，让玩家有一种这游戏就该在手机上玩的感觉，而不是去阉割玩家的游戏体验来达到对于手机平台的妥协；0回复・举报西园弓虎  RusherJe・2020-02-20农药和吃鸡本来也是好游戏嘛，朋友，不要那么狭隘，农药和吃鸡的玩家，就不是玩家了么？每个人都有自己适合的，喜欢的，去选择的游戏，不管是重氪，还是换皮，对于玩家层面来说，都是一样的，大家都是玩家，游戏没有高下，2回复・举报lucky⭐star✨  西园弓虎・2020-02-20我想他可能想说游戏不能局限于吃鸡农药和立绘，游戏应该各种各样的（虽然很难），但我认为这种想法是好的，游戏需要创意和玩法开发去推动发展0回复・举报魔法少年小圆  西园弓虎・2020-02-20农药还真没法说是好游戏吧...建模丑、台词尬、反人类的操作方式，全都是扣分项，要不是抄了个游戏形式MOBA+抄了别的游戏设计好的英雄+腾讯爸爸的大腿，这游戏还真没火的资格。
I don't think it's a good idea to play games with people (or to say, draw, or even paint). But I don't think it's a good game to try and capture the game itself, rather than having to emasculate the game itself.
4回复・举报RusherJe  西园弓虎・2020-02-20农药和吃鸡当然是好游戏，我这里也没有说它们不好的意思。

I'm not saying any games are bad here. I'm just saying that the vast majority of players at home have not yet reached the aesthetic level of players in countries where video games are more developed.
但是依然看好整体的游戏领域，因为经济下行，抑制高消费，口红经济会越来越吃香，而游戏就是非常明显的低价格高愉悦消费品。
But remain bullish on the gaming sector as a whole, as the economy falls and high consumption is curbed, and the lipstick economy will become increasingly popular, with games being a distinctly low-priced, high-pleasure consumer good.
