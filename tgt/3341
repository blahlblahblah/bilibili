网约车单量猛跌，所有人等待反弹一场自春节前开始爆发的新冠肺炎疫情，影响到各行各业。
Cyber car volume plummeted, all waiting for a rebound from the Spring Festival before the outbreak of pneumonia, affecting all walks of life.
网约车行业未能幸免。
The netcar industry has not been spared.
据不完全统计，2月份全国有30余个城市的网约车停运。
According to incomplete statistics, in February there were more than 30 cities across the country's network of cars shut down.
另外，易观数据也发布报告显示，在2020年春节期间，中国网约车市场每日直接订单损失超5.8亿元。
In addition, easy-to-view data released the report shows that during the 2020 Spring Festival, China's online car market lost more than 580 million yuan a day in direct orders.
这让网约车行业从原本期待的春节旺季，一下子跌入了谷底。
This let the network contract car industry from originally expected the Spring Festival season, suddenly fell into the trough.
踏入3月，随着疫情逐渐得到控制，企业陆续复工，如何“重启”的话题摆在了行业面前。
Step into March, as the epidemic gradually under control, enterprises have resumed work, how to "restart" the topic in front of the industry.
业内人士认为，这次疫情过后，网约车行业洗牌会加速，一些小平台、小运营公司很可能挺不过这个春天。
Industry insiders believe that after the epidemic, the network car industry shuffle will accelerate, some small platforms, small operating companies are likely to survive this spring.
“疫情让网约车行业暂时归零，一定程度上为B2C模式腾出了巨大的市场空间，是实现弯道超车的好机会。
"The epidemic so that the network car industry temporarily zero, a certain extent for the B2C model to free up huge market space, is a good opportunity to achieve corners overtaking.
”T3出行CEO崔大勇在接受媒体采访时坦言。
In an interview with the media, T3 trip CEO Cui Dayong said frankly.
T3出行CEO崔大勇网约车行业中，T3出行作为新兴网约车平台入局较晚，但作为一匹“黑马”，其运作模式和背景都不容小觑。
T3 trip CEO Cui Dayong online contract car industry, T3 travel as a new network platform late entry, but as a "dark horse," its mode of operation and background can not be underestimated.
它背后的资本力量不仅有东风、一汽和长安三大央企，还有阿里、腾讯和苏宁三大互联网公司，这些股东共同投资近百亿。
The capital behind it includes not only Dongfeng, FAW and Changan, but also three big internet companies - Ali, Tencent, and Suning - that have combined to invest nearly $10 billion.
截至目前，T3出行已进入南京、武汉、重庆、杭州、长春、广州六座城市,累计投入运营的新能源车辆超过15000辆。
T3 has so far entered six cities: Nanjing, Wuhan, Chongqing, Hangzhou, Changchun and Guangzhou, with a total of more than 15,000 new energy vehicles in operation.
现在整个网约车体系存在着两种截然不同的运营模式。
Now there are two different operating modes in the whole network system.
以共享为口号的C2C模式，力求实现个体与个体之间便捷的共享服务；而以T3出行为代表的B2C模式，则是以企业为主体提供统一标准的高品质快车服务。
C 2C, with sharing as its slogan, strives to realize convenient sharing service between individuals and individuals, while B2C, represented by T3 behavior, provides high-quality express service with enterprise as the main body.
以B2C模式入场的T3出行，究竟底气何在？又能否经得起考验？疫情当下，平台司机的状态，或许是最好的反应。
What is the bottom line of T3 travel in B2C mode? Can it stand the test? The state of the platform driver may be the best response to the epidemic.
“家里蹲”不慌疫情之下，网约车遭遇的困境也非常现实，首当其冲就是网约车司机们，他们普遍处于“挣不到钱慌，出去拉活儿更慌”的状态里。
"Squat at home" under the epidemic situation, the difficulties encountered by the network car is also very real, first of all, the net car drivers, they are generally "unable to earn money panic, go out to work more panic."
本来指望春节高峰多拉点活、多赚点的网约车司机，因为疫情，成了“家里蹲”。
Originally expected the peak of the Spring Festival Dora work, more money on the network of car drivers, because of the epidemic, became "squat at home."
有资料显示，疫情期间全国超过3000万名网约车司机，面临订单需求骤减、收入下滑甚至复工无期的困境。
More than 30 million drivers of online vehicles across the country faced a sharp drop in demand for orders, a drop in revenue and even a prolonged absence of work, according to data.
很多网约车司机一没流水保底，二没社保养老金。
Many net car drivers do not protect the bottom, two do not have social security pensions.
对于疫情严控期间无法出车的困境，司机不仅不能出门赚钱，还要承担着各种租金和生活支出压力，这对于以跑车收入为主的司机群体而言，无疑是给经济来源按下了暂停键。
For drivers unable to travel during the severe control of the epidemic, not only can not go out to make money, but also bear the pressure of various rental and living expenses, which for the group of drivers, mainly sports car income, is no doubt the key to the suspension of economic resources.
不仅如此，相对自有车辆司机的收入断档，租车跑网约车的司机群体面临的处境更加艰难，无论出车与否每月都需要缴纳车辆租金。
Not only that, but the group of drivers who rent their cars and use them is in a much more difficult position than their own car drivers, who pay monthly car rental fees, whether they travel or not.
“这方面来说，T3出行的司机会比其它的平台要幸福得多。
"In that sense, T3 drivers are far happier than other platforms.
”崔大勇表示，T3出行都是自持运力，司机并没有交租的压力。
Mr Choi said T3 trips were all self-supporting and drivers were under no pressure to pay.
可以复工的网约车司机们，也在担心感染的风险中，慌张地选择要不要在疫情期间出门接单。
Nettie drivers, who can get back to work, also fret about the risk of infection, choosing whether to go out and pick up orders during the outbreak.
此刻，如何恢复司机端的出行信心成为关键。
At the moment, how to restore the driver's travel confidence becomes key.
“你要向所有司机证明，平台这套防护措施是极其有效的，司机才不会害怕。
"You have to prove to all drivers that this set of precautions on the platform is extremely effective and that drivers are not afraid.
”崔大勇表示，T3出行第一时间为司机配备防护服、一次性医用手套、护目镜、口罩、消毒液、医用消毒片等全套合规的防护装备和消毒装备，作为防疫保障。
Mr Choi said the first time T3 traveled, drivers were provided with a full range of compliant protective equipment and disinfection equipment, including protective clothing, disposable medical gloves, goggles, masks, disinfectants and medical disinfection tablets, as a safeguard against epidemics.
在保障到位的前提下，T3出行率先在武汉集结了“特别行动车队”，为社区居民提供应急出行服务，为医护人员等特殊人群提供志愿免费服务。
Under the premise of ensuring the security in place, T3 first assembled in Wuhan "special operations convoys," to provide community residents with emergency travel services, for medical personnel and other special groups of people to volunteer free services.
据悉，武汉特别行动车队进驻社区车辆超400辆、志愿者人数超过700名。
It is reported that Wuhan special operations convoy into the community of more than 400 vehicles, more than 700 volunteers.
如今已服务101个社区近100000次出行，服务范围覆盖整个东湖新技术开发区。
Today, nearly 100,000 trips have been undertaken in 101 communities, covering the entire Donghu New Technology Development Zone.
T3出行武汉特别行动车队集结基于武汉特别行动车队的防控标准与模式实践，T3出行以产品化方式落实标准防疫举措，向全国所有运营城市，推出“T3出行健康车”，围绕公众出行防疫的各环节，将“安全”在车辆端、司机端、平台端上下足了功夫。
Wuhan Special Operations Group Based on Wuhan Special Operations convoy standards and mode of practice, T3 travel to implement standard epidemic prevention initiatives in a product-based manner, to all operating cities throughout the country, launched "T3 Travel Health Cars," around the public epidemic prevention, will "safe" at the end of vehicles, drivers, platforms.
T3出行健康车防疫到位，让T3出行实现订单“回暖”。
T3 travel health vehicle epidemic prevention in place, so that T3 travel to achieve "warm up" order.
据最近一周数据显示，T3出行司机端已有一半以上的复工率，需求端也在快速爬升，除了武汉以外，南京、重庆、杭州、广州、长春5个城市都呈回暖态势。
According to the latest data, T3 drivers have more than half the rate of return to work, and demand is climbing rapidly. Besides Wuhan, Nanjing, Chongqing, Hangzhou, Guangzhou and Changchun are showing signs of warming.
本次疫情，极大考验了网约车平台的社会服务能力，能否解决“安全”这个出行痛点，成为关键。
This epidemic situation, greatly tested the social service capacity of the network vehicle platform, whether the "safety" this travel pain point, becomes the key.
无疑，对于以私家车为主的网约车平台来说，车辆、司机都由网约车公司统一管理的B2C模式在安全性、标准化服务更具优势。
There is no doubt that for the private car-based network car platform, the vehicle, drivers are managed by the unified management of the network vehicle B2C model in security, more advantages of standardized services.
B端C端，谁更买单？疫情之后，全国各地的交通出行将恢复到原有水准，但是经过疫情“洗礼”后，网约车行业将会形成更高的行业规划，而消费者也将对网约车提出更高的服务需求，网约车竞争进入“以质取胜”新阶段。
B end C, who will pay the bill? After the epidemic, traffic across the country will return to the same level, but after the "baptism" of the epidemic, the industry will form a higher industry planning, and consumers will demand higher service, Nets competition into a "quality win" new stage.
事实上，网约车领域早期是一个门槛相对较低的行业，而且目前依旧处于供不应求的市场环境，只要有车和司机，就不愁没有单量。
In fact, early in the field of network cars is a relatively low threshold of the industry, and is still in short supply of the market environment, as long as there are cars and drivers, there is no shortage of orders.
前期，中国网约车主要是C2C模式，即网约车公司搭建公共平台，由乘客和司机自主发布需求及接单。
Earlier, China's network mainly C2C model, that is, the company set up a public platform, by the passengers and drivers to release the demand and orders.
尽管C2C模式在发展初期颇具优势，实现了野蛮式的增长。
Although the C2C model had the advantage of early development, it achieved barbaric growth.
然而面对日益增长的市场需求,松散管理下，从出行安全到出行体验，C2C模式缺乏统一的管理标准和可控的安全保障，也导致痛点暴露。
However, in the face of growing market demand, loose management, from travel safety to travel experience, the C2C model lacks uniform management standards and controllable security, which also leads to pain point exposure.
“所谓的C2C就是撮合，客户端打车，车辆端找个私家车，俩一撮合平台抽20%的佣金。
"The so-called C2C is matchmaking, client-side taxi, a private car at the end of the vehicle, two fixed platform smoking 20% commission.
”崔大勇认为，这种商业模式有个致命的弱点，是对C端私家车的认证，很难做到规范化和合规化。
Cui believes that the Achilles' heel of this business model is the certification of C-end private cars, which is difficult to standardize and comply with.
如果把网约车的前半程比喻成一场赌局的话，早期是比谁资本多，以“烧钱”模式为主。
If the first half of the network car compared to a gambling game, the early is more capital than who, to "burn money" mode.
如今进入下半场，是否合规化会成为关键。
Now into the second half, compliance will be the key.
疫情大考之后，业内人士普遍认为，网约车将从“野蛮生长”向“精细化运作”切换。
After the outbreak of the test, the industry generally agreed that the "barbaric growth" from the "refined operation" switch.
“移动出行是民生工程，随着疫情的影响，合规化的进程也会加速。
"Mobile travel is a livelihood project, with the impact of the epidemic, the process of compliance will also accelerate.
”崔大勇认为，2016年网约车新政的实施，在一定程度上为合规化腾出了巨大的市场空间。
Cui Dai-yong believes that the implementation of the 2016 New Deal for online vehicles, to a certain extent, for compliance to free up huge market space.
2018年网约车安全事件，更是将出行合规引爆在了大众眼前。
2018 security incidents, will travel compliance detonation in front of the public.
在行业实现合规化后，出行行业有望回归本质属性，变成公共出行重要组成部分。
After the compliance of the industry, the travel industry is expected to return to the essential attributes and become an important part of public travel.
崔大勇介绍，采用B2C模式的T3出行从定制化的新能源车型，到严格的司机准入审核体系，保证了合规实体运营。
Cui Dai-yong introduced that the B2C model of T3 travel from the customization of new energy vehicles, to the strict driver access audit system to ensure the operation of compliant entities.
“T3出行是全行业唯一一家对司机进行性格测试的网约车平台”。
"T3 travel is the only online platform in the industry that does character testing for drivers."
崔大勇介绍，T3出行的司机入职前有严格的背景调查，入职有系统的培训，这样对司机会形成一层过滤。
Dai Yong said that T3 drivers enter the job with strict background checks, on-boarding systematic training, so that the driver will form a layer of filter.
体现在消费者身上，B2C模式也可以为用户提供一个“确定化”的体验。
Reflected on the consumer, the B2C model can also provide users with a "definitive" experience.
“C2C的模式里有一个抢单制，也就是司机可以在抢单的时候取消订单。
"C2C" s model has a pre-emption system where the driver cancels the order while he grabs the ticket.
对于消费者而言，毫无确定性。
For consumers, there is no certainty.
而B2C是派单制，在客户不取消的前提下，车辆一定会确认派给。
And B2C is the dispatch system, in the customer does not cancel the premise, the vehicle will be confirmed to be sent.
”崔大勇认为，对于消费者来说，“确定性”在早晚高峰的时候，会超过价格要素。
"For consumers," certainty "will overtake the price factor in the morning and evening rush, says Mr Cui.
车辆、司机、服务都能实现合规化后，会形成一个良性闭环。
The vehicle, the driver, the service can realize the compliance, will form a benign closed loop.
经这次疫情影响，人们在选择网约车服务时将更加重视“质量”，而未来疫情结束后，这种趋势也将持续一段时间，进而总体上提高网约车行业的出行标准。
As a result of the epidemic, people will pay more attention to "quality" when choosing online vehicle services, and this trend will continue for some time after the end of the epidemic, thus improving the overall standard of travel in the netcar industry.
更重要的是，在崔大勇看来，现如今疫情让网约车行业暂时归零，这对B2C模式来说，是一个机会，两种运营模式站在了同一起跑线。
More importantly, in Cui Dai Yong's view, the current epidemic has let the network contract car industry temporarily zero, this is a B2C model, is an opportunity, the two operating models stand at the same starting line.
Analysys易观也认为，疫情之后的网约车供应侧，将更多的向资金实力强、风险抵御能力大、司机管控能力强的大型企业集中。
Analysys also believes that after the epidemic, the supply side of the network will be more capital-intensive, risk-resilient, strong driver control capacity of large enterprises.
预计疫情过后，网约车供应端竞争门槛逐步提高，头部网约车平台和主机厂将成为该领域的竞争焦点。
It is expected that after the epidemic, the threshold of competition for the supply side of netted vehicles will gradually increase, the head of the grid platform and the main plant will become the focus of competition in this field.
技术迭代与升级网约车平台B2C模式的可持续发展，也离不开技术的迭代与升级。
Iterative technology and upgrade the sustainable development of B2C network platform, but also inseparable from the iteration and upgrading of technology.
T3出行基于车联网技术的V.D.R安全防护系统，就是用创新技术来守卫司乘安全。
The V.D.R security system for T3 travel based on vehicle networking technology is to use innovative technology to guard the safety of drivers.
针对打车难和乘客出行安全的行业痛点，T3出行打造的解决方案为：车机接单、全程人脸验证、物理按键报警、24小时后台监控与应急指挥中心等，形成安全防护。
T3 travel solutions to the industry pain point of taxi and passenger travel safety: car order, whole process face verification, physical key alarm, 24-hour back-office monitoring and emergency command center, etc., to form a safety protection.
崔大勇将其称为互联网的福音，并介绍V.D.R安全防护系统日常为“三周一迭代”，从人脸识别、图像识别，到正在上线的声纹识别，AI与大数据技术的应用，对整个B2C的模式进行了“加持”，极大地提升了后台效率，减弱了人力成本。
Cui called it the Internet's gospel, and introduced the V.D.R security system, which routinely iterates through "three Monday iterations," from face recognition and image recognition to voice recognition on-line, AI and big data technology, adding "blessing" to the entire B2C model, greatly improving back-office efficiency and reducing labor costs.
基于此，T3出行将整个车辆运营期间的订单、前后客户的整个信息都进行透明化的管理，通过车内摄像头可以进行全时段行程监控，确保安全防护落实到位。
Based on this, T3 travel will be the entire vehicle operation order, before and after the customer's entire information transparent management, through the in-car camera can be full-time trip monitoring, to ensure that security protection is in place.
遇到紧急情况，这些都对安全性起到了最高的“防护”。
These provide the highest level of "protection" against safety in an emergency.
这将帮助T3出行抢占新赛道机会。
This will help T3 travel to grab new track opportunities.
对于T3出行布局车联网，崔大勇坦言：“当行业实现合规化后，无人驾驶一定是未来网约车发展的终极方向，T3出行以车联网技术为基础的网约车2.0模式将是必经之路。
For the T3 travel layout network, Choi admitted: "When the industry to achieve compliance, unmanned must be the ultimate direction of future network cars, T3 travel based on technology-based network 2.0 model will be the only way.
V.D.R安全防护系统将人车路全数据打通连接，这些数据未来将反哺无人驾驶。
The V.D.R security system connects all data on the road and on the road, which will be fed back to the future.
”对于去年7月22号才上线的T3出行来说，不到一年的时间，已经可以从容应对突发事件、甚至疫情等黑天鹅灾害，已经难能可贵。
Less than a year has passed since the T3, which only went online on July 22, was able to cope with emergencies and even outbreaks of black swan disasters.
“对T3出行来说，应该说我们的机遇是刚刚好。
"When it comes to T3 travel, it's fair to say our opportunities are just right.
”崔大勇表示，经过前期的一些实践，T3出行对B2C的模式进行了不断迭代和打磨。
"After some early practice, T3 travel to the B2C model of continuous iteration and grinding.
如今，T3出行已经把产品、管理水平、人员队伍都调整到了更好的准备期。
Today, T3 travel has adjusted products, management and staff to a better preparation period.
上半年的疫情恢复期，虽然影响了一些开城的节奏，但是对于精益化管理、队伍建设和系统迭代升级都提供了一个宝贵的准备时间，为下半年迅速开城提供了很好的机遇。
The recovery period in the first half of the year, while affecting some Kaesong rhythms, provided a valuable lead time for lean management, team-building and system iteration upgrades, as well as a good opportunity for a quick start in the second half of the year.
谈到疫情过后的下一步，崔大勇表示，“T3出行已锁定出行行业前48位的城市，也就是占到网约车80%市场份额的城市会是我们的聚焦点。
Turning to the next step after the epidemic, Cui said: "T3 travel has targeted the top 48 cities in the travel industry, that is, cities with an 80 per cent market share of online vehicles will be our focus."
”新的一年，在网约车行业的困境愈发凸显下，一定程度上，会促使行业加速洗牌，回归良性发展。
"In the new year, the plight of the online car industry is becoming more prominent, to a certain extent, will accelerate the industry shuffle, back to healthy development.
未来，出行行业从拼速度规模，到拼安全、品质、服务等标准的趋势也将会更加明显。
In the future, the travel industry from the scale of speed, to safety, quality, service standards will be more obvious.
能否为用户带来更好的体验和更多的价值，将成为未来网约车市场竞争的关键。
Can bring the better experience and more value to the user, will become the key to the future market competition of the networked car.
B端还是C端，百花齐放还是一枝独秀？或许特殊时期下的“大考”让局势已然分明。
B end or C end, a hundred flowers or a unique? Perhaps the special period of the "big test" let the situation has been clear.
当T3出行等所有网约车企业站在新的同一起点上，固有的市场格局或将被打破。
When T3 travel and all other network car enterprises stand on the same new starting point, the inherent market pattern may be broken.
大变局之后，紧接着的不是无序竞争，而是网约车行业有望步入可持续、良性发展轨道。
After the great changes, the next is not disorderly competition, but the network car industry is expected to enter a sustainable, benign development track.
