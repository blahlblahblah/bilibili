刚刚过去的周末，全球多国疫情出现恶化。
The past weekend has seen a worsening of the global multi-country epidemic.
在东亚，韩国确诊病例增加了195%；在南欧，意大利病例增加了近50倍；伊朗和日本的病例也在快速上升，多个国家报告出现首例确诊病例。
In East Asia, the number of confirmed cases increased by 195 per cent in South Korea; in southern Europe, the number of cases increased almost 50-fold; and in Iran and Japan, the first confirmed cases were reported in several countries.
这些变化或预示着遏制疫情全球大流行的时间窗口正在逐渐关闭。
These changes or the window of time that foreshadows a global pandemic are closing.
世界卫生组织总干事斯谭德塞22日在日内瓦与非洲联盟和非洲疾病预防控制中心官员的紧急会议上表达了上述担忧。
World Health Organization Director General Stantander 22 in Geneva with the African Union and African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials expressed the concern at an emergency meeting.
他在讲话中谈到，新冠肺炎病例在中国境外的增多，使得防止疫情全球扩散的“机会之窗”正在缩小。
The increase in new crown pneumonia cases outside China is narrowing the "window of opportunity" to prevent the global spread of the disease, he said in his speech.
目前，在中国以外报告病例最多的日本、韩国、意大利和新加坡等国，都已经出现了社区聚集性感染现象。
Community-based infections are now common in countries such as Japan, South Korea, Italy and Singapore, which report the largest number of cases outside China.
“日本、韩国、意大利和伊朗出现的社区传播现象让人担忧。
"Community transmission in Japan, South Korea, Italy and Iran is a cause for concern.
我们可能已经在疫情全球大流行的边缘。
We may be on the verge of a global pandemic.
当病毒在一些国家广泛传播，那么蔓延到其他国家是几乎不可避免的，因为今天任何一个国家都不可能完全关闭和世界其他地方的连接。
When the virus spreads widely in some countries, it is almost inevitable that it spreads to other countries, because today no country can completely close its doors to the rest of the world.
所以我们预期将经历一场大流行，即使目前还没有完全到来，但我们正在令人不安地接近。
So we expect to experience a pandemic, even if it is not yet fully under way, but we are approaching it with disquiet.
”美国国家过敏和传染病研究所所长、新冠病毒特别工作组成员安东尼·福西（Anthony Fauci）24日在接受澎湃新闻采访时（www.thepaper.cn）说道。

韩国总统文在寅周日发布紧急讲话，宣布把新冠疫情预警上调至最高级别“严重”。

更令人担忧的是，卫生部门目前尚无法定位此次大规模社区流行的确切传染源头和传播途径。
More worryingly, the health sector is not yet in a position to pinpoint the exact source and route of transmission of the epidemic in this large-scale community.
为防止疫情进一步扩散，病例报告最多的伦巴第及威尼托大区对共计约5万名居民居住的十余个市镇采取封闭管理，进出需特别许可。
In order to prevent further spread of the epidemic, the Lombardy and Veneto regions, which have the highest number of reported cases, have closed down more than a dozen municipalities with a total population of about 50,000 inhabitants, requiring special permits for access.

《纽约时报》报道称，美国疾病控制与预防中心（CDC）国家免疫和呼吸系统疾病中心主任南希·梅森尼尔（Nancy Messonnier）在周末的一场电话简报会上说，新冠疫情对公众健康构成了巨大的威胁，这种病毒“可能会成为一场流行病”。
Nancy Messonnier, director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Centre for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a telephone briefing over the weekend that the new crown 'poses a huge threat to public health and the virus' could become an epidemic.

“我们还没有在美国看到新冠病毒出现社区传播的情形，但这种情况最终很有可能会发生。
"We have not seen any community transmission of the new crown virus in the United States, but that could very well happen in the end.
”梅森尼尔强调，“我们现在的目标仍然是减缓新冠病毒在美国的传播速度。
"The goal remains to slow the spread of the new crown virus in the United States," Mason Neal stressed.
这会让我们赢得更多时间，为治疗更多病例和应对病毒持续传播做好准备。
That will buy us more time to prepare for more cases and for the continued spread of the virus.
”梅森尼尔还发出警告，在未来几周内，如果新冠病毒开始在美国社区传播，卫生部门将会不得不采取类似亚洲国家采取的一些措施，做好学校停课、企业停工的准备。
Mason Neal also warned that in the coming weeks the health authorities would have to take steps similar to those taken in Asia to prepare schools and businesses to close if the virus began to spread in the US community.
不过世卫总干事谭德塞表示，世卫组织目前最大的担忧是新冠病毒可能在卫生系统薄弱的国家中传播。
But WHO Director-General Lindsey says the biggest concern now is that the virus could spread in countries with weak health systems.
在周六的会议上，他警告非洲领导人迫切需要为此做准备。
At Saturday's meeting, he warned African leaders of the urgent need to prepare for it.
目前为止，非洲大陆只有一例确诊病例，大部分地区都没有受到感染，但卫生官员警告说，在医疗系统已经十分紧张的国家，疫情的蔓延可能是致命的。
