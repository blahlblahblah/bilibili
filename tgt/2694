宅家种菜理发炸油条通马桶……我们对自己的力量一无所知。
Homestead plant vegetables and cut fried dough sticks to pass the toilet We know nothing about our strength.

被迫宅在家中的四十来天，让时光仿佛倒流二十年，我们回到了那个万事需要自力更生的年代。
Forced to stay at home for 40 days, so that time seems to flow back 20 years, we returned to the time when all things need to be self-reliant.
没有快递，没有外卖，也没有Tony老师，习惯用钱解决问题的便捷生活暂时离我们而去。
No express delivery, no take-out, no Tony teachers, the convenience of spending money to solve problems is temporarily gone.
但自力更生也让不少人发现，原来，我们对自己的力量一无所知。
But self-reliance also lets a lot of people discover, original, we know nothing about own strength.
理发不是非得找Tony老师，淘宝上花几十块买个电推子就能收获快乐。
Hairdressers do not have to look for Tony teachers, Taobao spend dozens of dollars to buy an electric pusher can harvest happiness.
花八十块通厕所的服务，其实用马桶神器压一下就可以解决。
The service that spends 80 yuan to pass toilet, actually use closestool divine tool to press can be solved.
像凉皮、油条、馒头等等看起来复杂的食物，做起来也没有想象中那么难。
Food that looks complex, such as cold skins, fried dough and steamed buns, isn't as difficult to make as you might think.
我们只是自己限制了自己的能力，而如今，封印解除了。
We only limited our own abilities, and now the seal has been lifted.
我这应该算是个泥石流技能？之前刷微博时看到在家自制打蛋器的视频，觉得很好笑也很有意思，决定自己也做一个。
I thought it was a mudslide skill. I saw a video of a homemade beater while brushing my microblog and decided to do it myself.
正好想吃甜品，又没团购成功。
Just want to eat dessert, and did not buy a successful group.
我把之前家里装修时买家具送的电钻找出来，然后将一个矿泉水瓶子剪成两半，下面剪成锯齿状，再在瓶盖上钻个洞，上一个钉子，然后把钉子的尾巴安在钻头里就可以用了。
I found an electric drill that I had bought with furniture when I was decorating my house. I cut a mineral water bottle in half, cut it into jagged shapes below, drill a hole in the cap, put a nail in it, and then put the nail's tail in the drill.
电钻打蛋清打发得很快，但要按轻一点，不然就甩出来了。
The electric drill whipped the egg white very quickly, but it had to be lighter or it would be thrown out.
唯一的缺点是电钻有点重，举着手酸。
The only drawback is that the drill is a bit heavy, lifting the acid.
疫情期间家里马桶堵了，除了自己动手还能怎么办。
During the outbreak of the toilet at home blocked, in addition to doing what else can do.
我先买了个传统的马桶拔子，没用。
I bought a traditional toilet seat plug first, it doesn't work.
网上查的攻略也不管用，就去京东搜，有好多家牌子的马桶神器，但只有这个叫一炮通的有货，我这里可以收到，就将信将疑地买了。
Internet search strategy also does not work, go to Jingdong search, there are many brands of toilet gods, but only this one called a cannon of goods, I can receive here, will buy the letter skeptically.
它的外形像以前给自行车轮胎打气的打气筒，有一个气压表，打到通马桶需要的气压即可——就一下，立马通。
It's shaped like a pump used to pump gas out of bicycle tires. It has a barometer that hits the air pressure needed to flush the toilet.
建议大家都入手一个，有了它通马桶师傅可能得失业。
It is recommended that we all start with one, with which the toilet master may have to lose their jobs.
最近家里厨房的存货不多，每天吃菜薹吃得要命，就想换个口味。
There is not much stock in the kitchen these days, but I can't bolting everyday. I just want to change my taste.
我在抖音看到发绿豆芽的教程，家里正好有就做了。
I was shaking out a tutorial on mung bean sprouts, which I did at home.
没大盆子用就用的塑料瓶子，我爸在上面扎了好多洞，因为绿豆泡在水里久了会臭。
There were no large plastic bottles for him to use, and my dad had holes in them because mung beans stink after a long soak in the water.
我每天早晚冲两次水，控完了就放着。
I flush twice a day, morning and night, and when I'm done, I let it go.
泡到第四天，还没完全成功就给炒了，嗝。
On the fourth day, I got fired before I could finish it, burp.
吃的时候我爸还说应该用黄豆的，但现在武汉豆制品挺紧缺，我家这边豆腐上周才有团购，所以没什么可挑剔的。
When eating my father also said that should use soybeans, but now Wuhan bean products are rather scarce, my side of tofu only last week, so nothing to criticize.
我爸四十岁后喜欢上平头，觉得清爽，方便，头发长过一厘米就觉得不舒服。
My father likes flat head after 40 years old, feel fresh, convenient, hair longer than a centimeter to feel uncomfortable.
疫情期间，理发店都关门了，他没得办法。
The barber shop was closed during the outbreak and he could do nothing about it.
幸好我妈从淘宝上花几十块买了个电推子，儿童用的那种，剃刀头上有个罩子，贴着头皮推不会有高低不均匀的情况。
Luckily, my mother bought an electric pusher from Taobao, the kind used by children, with a hood over the head of the razor and no uneven height or height by pushing against her scalp.
那天我围观了剃头的过程，我爸一直赞美我妈手艺好，还强烈安利我也推平头。
The other day I watched the shaving and my dad always praised my mother for her good workmanship and Amway.
后来他出去买菜时，超市里查体温的工作人员问他在哪里理的头发，他得意地炫耀了一番，像个得到糖果的小孩子。
Later, while he was out shopping, the staff at the supermarket checked his temperature and asked him where he had his hair cut. He bragged like a kid who got candy.
我之前没有学过乐理，虽然一直想买电子琴，但没机会实现。
I hadn't studied music before, and though I always wanted to buy a keyboard, I didn't have a chance to do it.
这两天我跟着一个朋友学习编曲，用ios自带的GarageBand（库乐队），真的，我一个小时就学会了，没我开始想的那么难。
For two days I learned to compose music with a friend, using the Garage Band that I brought with me. Really, I learned it in an hour, not as hard as I first thought.
里面有各种乐器，还可以选智能乐器。
There are a variety of musical instruments, but also the choice of intelligent instruments.
比如我要编一个新裤子的《你要跳舞吗》，可以选多个音轨，先加入鼓，然后再选贝斯，吉他，键盘。
For example, if I had to weave a new pair of pants, "Do you want to dance," you could choose multiple tracks, first add the drum, then choose Bess, guitar, keyboard.
编前四个八拍用不了五分钟就听着像模像样，太有意思了。
The first four claps don't take five minutes to sound decent. That's funny.
烧烤的工具以前家里就有，疫情期间因为怀念武汉一家烧烤摊子的味道，加上太馋了，就学着它的做法在家里的后院烤。
BBQ tools used to be available at home, during the outbreak because of nostalgia for the smell of a barbecue stand in Wuhan, plus greediness, and learned how to bake it in the backyard.
肉切成大块，放点盐腌十分钟。
Cut the meat into large pieces and marinate it for ten minutes.
炉子烧炭，烤的时候用剪刀把烧焦的部分剪掉。
The stove burns charcoal, and the burnt part is cut off with scissors while baking.
看见烤的颜色和外面摊子上卖的差不多时，就可以撒上佐料。
Sprinkle with seasoning when you see that the color is about the same as that on the outside stall.
烤好后我把照片发到烧烤群里，受到了烧烤摊老板的表扬哈哈。
After roasting, I sent the photos to the barbecue group and was praised by the barbecue stand owner.
前阵子朋友圈流行做凉皮，看了攻略后才知道，原来凉皮是用高筋面粉做的。
A few days ago, friends do popular circle cool skin, read after the attack only to know that the original cold skin is made of high-gluten flour.
朋友圈里有人成功，也有人失败。
There are successes and failures in the circle of friends.
最近因为疫情在家空闲时间比较多，不想看沉重的新闻，就决定跟风做凉皮，特意去超市买了一袋高筋面粉。
Recently due to the epidemic at home more leisure time, do not want to see heavy news, decided to follow the wind to do cool skin, especially to the supermarket to buy a bag of high-gluten flour.
做起来比想象中费事太多。
It takes a lot of work than you think.
最大的意外是洗面剩下的面筋，不知是温度太低了，还是里面水分太多，酵母发酵不好，孔眼没发起来。
The biggest accident is to wash the face of the remaining gluten, I do not know whether the temperature is too low, or too much water inside, yeast fermentation is not good, hole did not start.
虽然不如一些凉皮店做得好吃，但这种时候能在家里吃上凉皮，还有什么可抱怨的呢？做油条其实挺麻烦的，还费油，最重要的是我家没有泡打粉，就按老家做油饼的方式做的。
Although not as delicious as some sandwiches, but this time can eat cool skin at home, what else can complain about? In fact, it is troublesome to do oil, but also waste oil, the most important thing is that my home do not bubble powder, the way to make oil cake.
发好面后揉出气，擀成饼，再切成条。
After the facial hair knead air, rolling into a cake, and then cut into strips.
然后把两个长条叠起来，用筷子放中间压着 ，拿起来一扭，就可以炸了。
Then double up the two long strips, with chopsticks placed in the middle of the pressure, pick up a twist, can be fried.
我和妈妈其实是一边看视频一边炸的，我觉得太麻烦了，我妈倒是还好。
Mom and I actually watched the video and blew it up. I thought it was too much trouble. My mother was fine.
疫情期间我们天天在家研究吃的，要不然时间可怎么过啊。
We study food at home every day during the outbreak, otherwise how time can be spent.
我是一个文科生，不过男人都会对机械的东西比较感兴趣吧，再加上电子产品这种东西，拆得多了自然就会了。
I am a liberal arts student, but men will be more interested in mechanical things, plus electronics, such things, more natural.
我拆过诺基亚Lumia手机也拆过电脑。
I tore down Nokia Lumia's cell phone and the computer.
第一次拆自己电脑，是想清理灰尘，结果装回去之后发现，手里多了几个螺丝。
The first time I opened my computer, I wanted to clean up the dust, but when I put it back, I found that I had some more screws in my hand.
很意外地不影响电脑使用，然后我就把那几个螺丝扔了，假装没有。
I accidentally left the computer untouched, and then I threw away the screws and pretended not to have them.
后来再拆东西，就学会了拆一层，画示意图记一层。
Later the demolition of things, learned to remove a layer, drawing schematic record a layer.
这次是给公司的电脑换屏，比较简单。
This is for the company's computer screen change, relatively simple.
因为电脑主要都是卡扣，只有四个螺丝，就大胆拆。
Because the computer is mainly buckle, only four screws, boldly removed.
自己拆其实主要是因为公司不给报销 ，所以干脆就淘宝买屏自己换。
In fact, the main reason why the company does not reimburse, so simply Taobao buy their own screen exchange.
三百块的72%色域IPS屏，十五分钟换完了，耶。
Seventy-two percent of the 300 color gamut IPS screen. Fifteen minutes, yeah.
-如今生活越来越便利，许多时候，我们更愿意选择用钱买到结果，而不是在探索中学习和收获经验。
-Life is becoming more and more convenient these days, and in many cases we prefer to buy results with money instead of learning and reaping the benefits of exploration.
所以当这些天人们不得不亲自动手解决问题时才发现，原来许多事情并不像想象中那么难。
So when people have to solve problems by hand these days, it turns out that many things are not as difficult as they might think.
动起手来吧，get新技能的同时，说不定从中还能收获额外的乐趣。
Hands up, get a new set of skills, and maybe get some extra fun out of it.
