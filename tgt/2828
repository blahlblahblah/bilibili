一边货币政策已经很宽松，利率已经很低了，政策腾挪空间不大；另一边市场恐惧和病毒传播却未停止，防疫拉锯战才刚刚开始，金融稳定迹象还不明显文 |《财经》特派记者 金焱 发自华盛顿编辑 | 苏琦在疫情和市场的巨大双重压力下，美联储主席鲍威尔于当地时间3月3日出人意料地举行新闻发布会，宣布降低联邦基金利率50个基点至1%-1.25%，将超额准备金率（IOER）下调50个基点至1.1%。
While monetary policy has been accommodative, interest rates are already low, leaving little room for manoeuvre. On the other hand, market fears and the spread of the virus have not stopped.
以应对新冠肺炎疫情给经济活动带来的风险。
To cope with the new crown pneumonia outbreak of economic activities brought about by the risk.
这是自2008年金融危机以来，美国首次采取紧急降息措施，也是自那时起幅度最大的一次降息。
It was the first emergency rate cut since the 2008 financial crisis and the largest since then.
美股此前在3月2日全线上涨，道指从连续七个交易日的下跌中反弹，创下10多年来的最大单日涨幅，只因投资者押注各国央行能够稳定市场。
U.S. stocks had risen across the board on March 2, as the Dow rallied from a seven-day decline to its biggest one-day gain in more than a decade as investors bet on central banks' ability to stabilize markets.
鲍威尔果断出手，他指出，降息行动是为了帮助美国经济在危机中保持强劲；目前就业增速稳固，薪资增长继续保持；病毒和应对措施将在一定时间内拖累经济活动；未来将继续行动保持经济强劲，适当使用工具和行动以支撑经济。
Powell moved decisively, pointing out that the rate cut was intended to help the US economy remain strong through the crisis; that job growth was now solid and wage growth would continue; that the virus and the response would drag economic activity down for some time; and that action would continue in the future to keep the economy strong and make appropriate use of tools and actions to support the economy.
降息可以提升家庭和企业信心；目前还没有考虑其他措施；一次降息不足以解决供应链问题，但可以避免金融环境收紧。
Cutting interest rates would boost household and business confidence; no other measures are currently under consideration; a rate cut would not be enough to solve supply-chain problems, but would avoid a tightening of the financial environment.
美联储降息消息发布后，美国总统特朗普马上在推特上发表看法，要求美联储采取更宽松的政策。
Immediately after the Fed cut, US President Trump tweeted that the Fed should adopt a more relaxed policy.
虽然美联储主席鲍威早在2月28日的声明中暗示，美联储已为下调利率做好准备，旨在缓解潜在公共卫生危机和全球经济放缓扩大对美国经济造成的影响。
While Federal Reserve Chairman John Bowey hinted in his February 28 statement that the Fed was ready to cut interest rates, the aim was to mitigate the impact on the US economy of a potential public health crisis and a broader global economic slowdown.
但美联储的举动大大出乎市场预料，因它并不在美联储原定的联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）全年会议日程中，按照原定计划，3月份的议息会议将在3月17日-18日举行。
But the Fed acted far beyond market expectations, as it was not on the full-year agenda of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) scheduled for March 17-18, as originally planned.
然而出乎部分投资者意料，在美联储如此强势反应下，3月3日美股延续了震荡走势，美三大股指窄幅高开后快速下探跌幅均超1%，随后在美联储将基准利率下调50个基点消息刺激下直线拉升均涨超1.2%，随即深度下探，其中道指从高位下挫近1400点后小幅反弹，但跌幅仍高达近800点。
However, contrary to the expectations of some investors, U.S. stocks continued to wobble on March 3, with the three main U.S. stock indexes slipping more than 1% after a narrow opening and rising more than 1.2% as the Fed cut its benchmark rate by 50 basis points.
当天标普500指数收跌86.86点，跌幅2.81%，报3003.37点；道指收跌785.91点，跌幅2.94%，报25917.41点；纳指收跌268.08点，跌幅2.99%，报8684.09点。
The S & P 500 was down 86.86 points, or 2.81%, to 3003.37, the Dow was down 785.91 points, or 2.94%, at 25917.41, while the index closed down 268.08 points, or 2.99%, at 8684.09.
美国大型科技股全线走低，苹果跌3.18%，亚马逊跌2.3%，奈飞跌3.22%，谷歌跌3.51%，Facebook跌5.37%，微软跌4.79%。
Major U.S. technology stocks were lower, with Apple down 3.18%, Amazon down 2.3%, Naifei down 3.22%, Google down 3.51%, Facebook down 5.37%, Microsoft down 4.79%.
在市场人士看来，美联储紧急降息意在回应投资者关切，原本有利于稳定市场预期。
The Fed's emergency rate cut was seen by market participants as a response to investor concerns and intended to help stabilize market expectations.
但同时，联储采取如此罕见举措，也暗示了目前市场和疫情问题之严重。
But at the same time, the Fed's rare moves suggest the scale of the current market and epidemic.

疫情蔓延，市场大幅震荡，多位接受《财经》记者采访的华尔街人士表示，3月3日收盘后各路基金经理共同问的一个问题是，现在怎么办？金融服务公司B. Riley FBR Inc.首席全球策略师兼董事总经理马克·格兰特(Mark J. Grant)对《财经》记者表示：市场预期到了美联储降息，但未有料到降的幅度一下子就是50个基点，我们现在又靠近了近零利率的水平线， 说明美联储的政策空间已经不大了。
'The market expects the Fed to cut interest rates, but the unexpected drop is 50 basis points at a time when we're near zero, 'said Mark J. Grant, chief global strategist and managing director at Caijing after the March 3 close, suggesting the Fed has little policy space.
