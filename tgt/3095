作为一个科学大国，英国是如何应对新冠疫情的？他们是否能走出一条和中国不同、社会成本更低而行之有效的防疫之路？为此我们采访了流行病学专家、牛津大学终身教授陈铮鸣。
As a scientific powerhouse, how did Britain respond to the new crown? Can they find a way out of the epidemic that is different from China and has a lower social cost? We interviewed Chen Ming, an epidemiologist and lifelong professor at Oxford University.
英国于 1 月底确诊第一位来自中国的输入性新冠患者。
The UK confirmed the first imported new crown patient from China in late January.
截至 3 月 8 日，新冠患者确诊数量为 273 例，位列欧洲第六位，排在意大利、法国、德国、西班牙和瑞士之后。
As of March 8, 273 new crown cases had been diagnosed, ranking sixth in Europe, behind Italy, France, Germany, Spain and Switzerland.
3 月 6 日出现第二个死亡病例，为一名 80 多岁男性。
A second case of death occurred on 6 March, involving a man in his 80s.
随着武汉疫情的暴发，1 月底英航和维珍航空暂停了往返中国大陆的所有航班，随后英国政府派专机从武汉和周边地区撤侨 300 余人。
Following the outbreak of the Wuhan epidemic, British Airways and Virgin Islands suspended all flights to and from China at the end of January, and the British Government sent planes to evacuate more than 300 people from Wuhan and surrounding areas.
陈铮鸣介绍说，尽管如此，英国整体还算比较淡定和理性。
Nevertheless, Britain as a whole is relatively calm and rational, Chen said.
对通过其他航班或途径抵英的旅客或返程的公民，如来自湖北省，或中国其他地区但有相关症状（如发烧），则英国政府要求居家自我隔离 14 天。
For visitors arriving in the UK by other flights or routes, or returning citizens from Hubei province or other parts of China with associated symptoms (such as fever), the British Government requires a 14-day period of home isolation.
除此之外，并无任何其他限制和规定。
There are no other restrictions or provisions.

（来源：BBC）整个 2 月份，英国的疫情相对稳定，只有 20 余人确诊，且绝大多数为输入性，并在很短的时间内隔离了密切接触者，有效地防止了疫情的扩散。
(Source: BBC) Throughout February, the epidemic in the United Kingdom was relatively stable, with only about 20 cases diagnosed, mostly imported, and close contacts isolated within a short period of time, effectively preventing the spread of the outbreak.
近一周多以来，随着意大利疫情的急剧恶化和输入性病例的增加，英国的感染人数也出现了快速上升的趋势。
Britain has also seen a rapid rise in the number of infections over the past week, as the epidemic has worsened sharply in Italy and imports have increased.
为此，英国政府出台了完整的防疫计划，以应对疫情的蔓延。
To that end, the British Government has put in place a comprehensive vaccination programme to deal with the spread of the epidemic.
英国政府公布的防疫计划共分 4 个阶段包括围堵、拖延、研究和减损。
The UK Government's immunization programme comprises four phases: containment, delay, research and mitigation.
目前的防疫政策仍集中在围堵阶段，主要是及时诊断并追踪和隔离所有密切接触者。
Current vaccination policies remain focused on the containment phase, primarily the timely diagnosis and tracking and isolation of all close contacts.
如疫情进一步恶化，出现广泛的社区传播，则考虑转入防疫第二阶段，即拖延和 “社会隔离” 阶段，相关措施包括休学、休市、休工，以避免短期内出现疫情的大暴发，并尽量拖延至夏季，使医疗机构能有更充足的资源从容应对病人的诊治。
If the outbreak deteriorates further and widespread community transmission occurs, consideration is given to moving to the second phase of immunization, i.e., delay and "social isolation," with measures such as suspension of schooling, rest periods and work breaks to avoid a major outbreak in the short term and to delay until the summer, so that medical institutions have more resources to respond adequately to patient care.
陈铮鸣说，在新发疫情面前，政府应该实事求是，及时通报疫情发展包括可能出现的最坏的结果，以及相关的个体和社会的防疫措施，这可能是避免无谓恐慌和疫情蔓延最好的“疫苗”。
In the face of a new outbreak, Chen said the government should be realistic and keep abreast of the development of the epidemic, including the worst possible outcome, as well as related individual and social preventive measures, which may be the best "vaccine" against senseless panic and spread of the epidemic.

(Source: HEALTHMAP) "This is not a small battle, and the British have prepared for the worst.
”DeepTech：意大利为什么会成为欧洲的重灾区，而且感染者中病死率这么高？陈铮鸣：意大利成为重灾区有偶然的因素，也可能有其必然的因素。
"DeepTech: Why did Italy become a major disaster area in Europe, with such a high fatality rate among the infected?
首先意大利是旅游胜地，到访的中国游客人数甚多，每年超过 150 万人次，而中国赴英游客最高纪录是 27 万人次。
First, Italy is a tourist destination, with more than 1.5 million Chinese visitors a year, compared with a record 270,000 visitors from China.
另外还有一个很特殊的情况，目前在意大利生活、工作、定居的温州人约有十几万，是一个非常庞大的群体，春节前后人口流动非常频繁。
There is also a very special situation, living, working and settling in Italy about a hundred thousand Wenzhou people, is a very large group, the Spring Festival before and after the very frequent population movements.
同时温州是湖北以外中国疫情最为严重的城市，因为温州人在武汉经商的特别多。
Wenzhou is also the worst-affected city in China outside Hubei because Wenzhou people do business in Wuhan in particular.
这样无形就增加了疫情在意大利扩散的风险慨率。
This invisibility increases the risk profile of the epidemic in Italy.
（DeepTech 注：截至 3 月 9 日，温州确诊数量为 504 例，是湖北省以外确诊病例最多的中国城市。
As of March 9, the number of confirmed cases in Wenzhou was 504, the highest number outside Hubei province.
）意大利在疫情刚开始的时候没有采取任何措施，直到 1 月 30 日才暂停了飞往中国大陆、香港和台湾的航班。
Italy did nothing at the beginning of the outbreak, and did not suspend flights to mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan until January 30.
在这之前，已有大量来自温州或中国其他地区的游客抵达意大利。
Prior to that, a large number of tourists from Wenzhou or other parts of China had arrived in Italy.
此外，即使禁飞也并不能完全封锁住疫情传播，尤其是在欧洲人口流动十分频繁，人们仍然可以从欧洲其他国家自由进入意大利。
Moreover, even a flight ban would not completely block the spread of the epidemic, especially in Europe, where people still have free access to Italy from the rest of Europe.
另外，新冠病毒主要通过飞沫和密切接触传播，而意大利人是非常热情的民族，有见面互相拥抱和接吻的习惯，这就增加了病毒传播的可能性。
In addition, the new crown virus is transmitted mainly through droplets and close contact, while Italians are a very warm people with a habit of meeting each other and kissing, which increases the likelihood of the virus spreading.
意大利的新冠病毒病死率比中国还要高，大约 4%。
Italy has a higher death rate for the new crown virus than China, about 4 percent.
目前死亡病例中，平均年龄高达 81 岁，绝大部分患者生前都有其他健康问题，这可能相当程度上导致了高死亡风险。
At present, the average age of death is as high as 81 years, and the vast majority of patients have other health problems during their lifetime, which may contribute significantly to the high risk of death.
DeepTech：英国也有来自意大利的输入病例吧？陈铮鸣：英国境内疫情绝大多数都是输入性的，特别是从中国、意大利、钻石公主号等重点区域来的旅行者，以及从新加坡君悦酒店参加商业会议回来的超级传染者。
The vast majority of outbreaks in the UK are imported, especially from China, Italy, the Princess Diamond, and super-infected people returning from business meetings at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Singapore.
第一波是从中国过来的新冠携带者，第二波主要来自欧洲大陆。
The first wave is new crowns from China, and the second is mainly from continental Europe.
2 月下旬正好是学生放假，有一个 10 天左右的假期，很多人就到意大利去度假滑雪，最近陆陆续续发生的很多病人都与意大利有关。
The second half of February coincides with the student holiday, with a holiday of about 10 days. Many people go to Italy for holiday skiing. Recently, a large number of patients have been involved in Italy.
目前英国被传染的患者相对年纪较轻，所以病死率没有意大利那么高。
Infected people in Britain are relatively young, so the fatality rate is not as high as in Italy.
从意大利各地度假回来的人目前大都采取了居家隔离措施，但是否能有效地防止发生广泛的社区传播，目前形势并不乐观。
The majority of people returning from vacations in various parts of Italy have so far resorted to residential segregation, but the situation is not encouraging as to whether it can be effective in preventing widespread community transmission.
DeepTech：英国政府制定了四步走的行动计划，看起来有条不紊，这样的举措来应对新发疫情是惯例吗？陈铮鸣：英国是比较崇尚科学、重视科学的，应对重大公共卫生事件，喜欢讲科学规矩、讲科学套路。
Is it the norm for the UK government to adopt a four-step action plan to deal with the new outbreak? Chen Ming: The UK is more scientific, values science, deals with major public health events, likes to talk about scientific rules and practices.
循证决策这一点很重要。
Evidence-based policymaking is important.
比如 1990 年代疯牛病时期，英国对奶牛怎么传播病毒做了大量公共卫生研究，再根据研究的证据不断调整应对方案。
For example, during mad cow disease in the 1990 "s, the UK conducted extensive public-health research into how cows spread the virus, and then adapted its response to the research evidence.
此次应对新冠病毒的疫情，英国政府也汇集了大量的专家，包括流行病学、公共卫生以及临床专家，由他们制定出一套科学的行动方案作为指南，然后政府决策，而不是说匆忙上阵。
The British government has also brought together a wide range of experts, including epidemiologists, public health, and clinicians, to develop a set of scientific action plans to guide government decision-making, rather than rushing into action.
这不是一场小规模的战斗，英国也做了最坏的打算。
It was not a skirmish, and Britain prepared for the worst.
首相约翰逊称，不排除五分之一的劳动力同时患病的可能。
Prime Minister Johnson says it is not ruled out that one in five workers is sick at the same time.
当然这个是最坏的结果。
This, of course, is the worst.
从科学角度来讲，这是实事求是的做法，应该告诉民众可能出现的最坏的结果是什么，要相信民众的判断能力。
From a scientific point of view, it is realistic to tell people what the worst possible outcome is, and to trust in the judgment of the people.
“中国的有些措施在英国同样可行，而有些不可行，且社会成本过高。
"Some of China's measures are equally feasible in the UK, some are not feasible and the social costs are too high."
”DeepTech：有报道英国属于内紧外松的这种做法，似乎跟新加坡做法有点像。
DeepTech: It has been reported that the UK is a tight-knit country, something like Singapore.
陈铮鸣：我觉得目前疫情还是一个过渡阶段，还会继续恶化，后期对英国政府和医疗体系的挑战极大。
I think the current epidemic is still a transitional period and will continue to worsen. The challenges to the British government and the health care system in the future are enormous.
目前患普通感冒和流感的病人很多，加上医生和护士短缺（大约有数万名护士岗位空缺），医疗体系已经处于一种紧绷的状态。
With so many common colds and flu cases and a shortage of doctors and nurses (about tens of thousands of vacancies), the health-care system is already stretched.
未来肯定要根据疫情的发展来研判并逐步调整防控措施，以及作出必要的取舍。
The future will certainly depend on the evolution of the epidemic to determine and gradually adjust control measures, as well as to make the necessary trade-offs.
中国的有些措施在英国同样可行，而有些不可行，且社会成本过高。
Some of China's measures are equally feasible in the UK, while others are not, and the social costs are too high.
除伦敦外英国的人口密度较低，这对疫情防控相对有利。
Britain has a relatively low population density outside London, which is relatively good for disease control.
相反，英国的社区没有围墙的，四通八达，根本无法像中国那样对小区实行封闭式管理，另外民众可能也不答应。
By contrast, Britain's neighborhoods are walled and unconnected, and simply cannot be managed as tightly as China does, and the public may not agree.
DeepTech：英国学术界、科学界在新冠疫情发生以来做了哪些工作？陈铮鸣：英国医学研究委员会在 2 月初就出台了一个研究计划，拨款 2000 万英镑，用于开展疫苗、药物以及流行病学研究。
What has the British academic and scientific community done since the outbreak of the new crown Chen: The British Medical Research Council launched a research programme in early February, allocating 20 million pounds to vaccine, drug and epidemiological studies.
近期，政府又投入了更多的资金，加快研发步骤和力度。
Recently, the government has invested more funds to accelerate the pace and intensity of research and development.
科研方面，牛津和帝国理工学院做了不少工作，包括疫苗和疫情预测。
In scientific research, Oxford and Imperial College of Technology have done a lot, including vaccine and epidemic forecasting.
1 月中，帝国理工的一个团队根据有限的海外感染人数数据，较为准确地评估出了武汉的疫情。
In mid-January, a team from Imperial Science accurately assessed the Wuhan epidemic based on limited overseas infection figures.
牛津的传染病研究实力非常强，新冠病毒的疫苗研究在国际上处于领先地位，现已小批量生产，可能 5、6 月份就可以进入人体试验。
Oxford has a strong record in infectious disease research, and is a world leader in vaccine research for the new crown virus. It is now produced in small batches and may be ready for human trials in May and June.
此外，牛津的一个团队和中日友好医院曹彬团队合作，共同参与瑞德西韦临床试验。
In addition, an Oxford team worked with a team from the Sino-Japanese Friendship Hospital Cao Bin to participate in a clinical trial in Rhetsevier.
DeepTech：新冠疫情发生以来，英国社会的认识有什么样的演变？陈铮鸣：最近一段时间媒体报道密度明显加大。
How has the perception of British society evolved since the outbreak of the New Crown? Chen Ming: Media coverage has become much more intense in recent times.
除了报道疫情和政府措施外，也有很多专家来解读。
In addition to reporting on the epidemic and government measures, there are many experts to interpret.
此外，也有大量公益性广告，进行健康宣教。
In addition, there are also a large number of public welfare advertising, health education.
其主旨是让民众充分知情，正确认识相关病症以及应该采取的防控措施。
Its main purpose is to let the public fully informed, correct understanding of the relevant diseases and should take preventive and control measures.
武汉疫情初始是一个教训。
Wuhan outbreak of the initial is a lesson.
由于大家不知情，都很盲目，感觉没事，一旦宣布人传人以及封城以后，大量民众产生恐慌情绪并蜂拥到医院，这就导致第二波、第三波的病毒传播和医院交叉感染。
Unbeknownst to all, blind and feeling fine, once the man-to-man declaration and the closure of the city were announced, a large number of people became frightened and rushed to the hospital, resulting in a second and third wave of virus transmission and cross-infection in hospitals.
当然这跟医疗体制有关。
Of course this has to do with the health system.
英国目前增设了高通量的电话专线，万一出现可疑症状先拨打电话，有专人收集相关信息并提供诊疗建议。
The UK has now added a high-capacity telephone line, in the event of suspicious symptoms to call first, someone to collect relevant information and provide medical advice.
当地的公共卫生机构会派人上门，或者让患者到指定机构去采样做检查。
The local public health agency sends someone to the house or sends the patient to a designated institution for sampling and examination.
这在很大程度上避免了直接去医院就诊发生交叉感染的风险。
This largely avoids the risk of cross-infection by going directly to the hospital.
图 | 英国政府对怀疑自己感染新冠病毒者的建议：不要去医院、社区诊所或急诊，首先拨打专线电话，自我隔离，报告信息，检测，听从医务工作者的建议。
Britain's advice to anyone suspected of contracting the new crown virus: Don't go to a hospital, a community clinic or an emergency. Call a dedicated line first, isolate yourself, report information, test, and follow the advice of a health worker.
（来源：BBC）DeepTech：英国民众对戴口罩是怎样的认识？与世界卫生组织关于戴口罩的建议一致吗？陈铮鸣：对于戴口罩，东西方有明显的文化差异。
(Source: BBC): What do British people think about wearing masks? Do they agree with the World Health Organization's recommendation on wearing masks? Chen Ming: There is a distinct cultural difference between East and West in wearing masks.
我到这里住了 30 年，几乎没有看到任何人戴口罩。
I've lived here for 30 years and hardly ever seen anyone wearing a mask.
只有病人到医院里去看病，为了防止打喷嚏的飞沫，才需要戴口罩，对正常人是没有必要戴口罩的。
Only the patient goes to the hospital to see the doctor, in order to prevent sneezing droplets, need to wear masks, to normal people is not necessary to wear masks.
如果戴上口罩在大街上，英国人就会认为一个病人到处走动是危险的。
If you wear a mask on the street, the British will think it is dangerous for a patient to walk around.
所以这也引发了一些冲突。
So it has also led to some clashes.
目前英国将近 7000 万人只有 200 多例确诊，全民都戴口罩不现实，对预防病毒感染的效果也不会明显。
With nearly 70 million people in the UK diagnosed with only 200 cases, it would be unrealistic for the population to wear masks and would have little impact on the prevention of infection.
世界卫生组织发布的新冠病毒个人防护指南建议是，在出现相关症状或在照顾疑似患者或确诊患者时才需要戴口罩。
The World Health Organization's guidelines on personal protection for the new crown virus recommend wearing masks only when symptoms arise or when care is given to suspected or confirmed patients.
很多人戴了口罩不洗手，或者戴口罩方法不正确，反而会增加感染风险。
Many people don't wash their hands with a mask, or wear them incorrectly, which increases the risk of infection.
当然，随着疫情的变化，人们的心理和风险预期也可能发生明显的改变。
Of course, as the epidemic changes, so can people's psychological and risk expectations.
DeepTech：在中国口罩不是一个小问题，其实还衍生了一些次生的问题，比如说不戴口罩就不能进超市，不能进入商场，甚至在大街上不戴口罩会被抓起来。
DeepTech: Masks are not a minor problem in China, but they also give rise to secondary problems, such as not being able to enter a supermarket without a mask, not being able to enter a store, or even being arrested on the street without a mask.
中国是不是对口罩的作用夸大了？陈铮鸣：大家刚开始对疫情不重视，重视之后却是恐慌，于是出现拼命抢口罩的现象。
Is China's role in masks exaggerated? Chen Ming: People just start to pay little attention to the epidemic, but then panic, then there is a desperate looting of masks.
很大程度上，大家自觉不自觉把戴口罩作为一个很重要的心理安慰，尤其是在目前疫情已得到完全控制的地区。
To a large extent, wearing masks has been recognized as an important psychological comfort, especially in areas where the epidemic is now well under control.
要全社会完全摘口罩并非易事，可能还需要做很多铺垫和宣教工作。
It is not easy for the whole society to remove masks completely. It may require much preparation and education.
“在英国，这个循证决策的过程是一种传统。
"This evidence-based decision-making process is a tradition in the UK.
”DeepTech：能不能介绍一下此次疫情中的英国政府跟专家的关系，以及其首席科学家的运作模式？陈铮鸣：发生新生疫情时，政府不可能拍脑子来做决策，首先要从科学层面来进行评估。
"DeepTech: Can you describe the relationship between the UK government and experts in this epidemic, and the mode of operation of its chief scientist?
首席科学家会召集各个领域的专家，包括流行病学、临床、疫情模型预测等各个领域专家来提出各种预案以及应对措施，不打无准备之仗。
The Chief Scientist will bring together experts in various fields, including epidemiology, clinical, and epidemic model prediction, to come up with a variety of scenarios and countermeasures, not a war of preparedness.
在英国，这个循证决策的过程是一种传统。
In Britain, this evidence-based decision-making process is a tradition.
在这基础上由政府拿出具体的行动方案，这个行动方案不完全是考虑医学的，它要考虑最坏的结果和最好的结果，包括物资调配、防御工作（社区防御、机场安全等等）。
On this basis, the Government produces a specific programme of action, which is not exclusively medical but takes into account the worst-case scenario and the best possible outcome, including the deployment of materials, defence (community defence, airport security, etc.).
因为牵一发动全局，一旦决策错了或做过头了带来的影响也不得了。
Because pull a global start, once the decision is wrong or do too much of the impact.
当然这个方案也不是一成不变，它也可能不断调整。
Of course, the scheme is not static, it may also be constantly adjusted.
100 年以前，英国在应对西班牙大流感的时候也犯过错。
One hundred years ago, Britain also made a mistake in its response to the Spanish flu.
当时的社会相对比较专制，有两个非常深刻的教训。
Society was relatively authoritarian, and there were two very profound lessons.
第一，西班牙大流行持续了 2 年，来了三波。
First, the Spanish pandemic lasted two years, with three waves coming.
其实第一波影响不是很大，后面两波影响更大。
In fact, the first wave of impact is not very large, the latter two waves more.
第二，英国当时担心民众恐慌，也是封锁消息，一些游行聚会也没取消，所以在很大程度上导致了疫情的恶化和蔓延。
Second, fears of mass panic and blockades in Britain, as well as the failure to cancel some of the marches, contributed significantly to the worsening and spread of the epidemic.
DeepTech：请谈一下中国政府和专家的关系，因为在中国疫情中，一些专家的表现也有不合理的地方。
DeepTech: Please talk about the relationship between the Chinese government and experts, because in the Chinese epidemic, some experts are not performing well.
陈铮鸣：很重要的一点是要有一个专业的声音。
Chen Shining: It is very important to have a professional voice.
专业的声音第一就是要实事求是，第二要及时通报和解读疫情和防控措施。
The first professional voice is to seek truth from facts, and the second is to promptly inform and interpret the epidemic situation and prevention and control measures.
信息公开了以后，人们的解读就不会差别太大。
When information is made public, people's interpretations do not differ much.
中国的疫情通报和解读中，早期似乎更侧重临床治疗，而缺少针对疫情的专业分析和解读。
In China, the early stage of disease notification and interpretation seems to focus more on clinical treatment than on professional analysis and interpretation of the epidemic.
比方说有人经常提到所谓的拐点，但对于什么叫拐点并没有给出清晰的定义。
For example, some people often refer to the so-called inflection point, but there is no clear definition of what is called an inflection point.
同样，对于疫情的结束，目前也没有明确的定义。
Similarly, there is no clear definition of the end of the epidemic.
可能在不同的地区要采用不同的标准，不能一刀切。
Different standards may be applied in different regions, and there is no one size fits all.
比如埃博拉疫情的结束是最后一个患者出院后两个潜伏周期内没有再出现任何病人。
The end of the Ebola outbreak, for example, was the last patient to be released from hospital without another patient in two incubation cycles.
若没有明确的标准，就难以把握和掌控，民众也会产生迷茫，对民生和经济生产的恢复也会带来不利的影响。
Without clear standards, it will be difficult to grasp and control, people will be confused, and will adversely affect people's livelihood and economic recovery.
DeepTech：你认为中国适合英国这样的首席科学家制度吗？陈铮鸣：应该可以，也不一定是一个科学家，但是应该可以有一个德高望重的人来担当这个角色。
Do you think China is suitable for a chief scientist like Britain? Chen Shining: It should be possible, and not necessarily a scientist, but there should be someone of high moral standing to take on the role.
这里并不是说由他来做决策，因为任何人的科学认识可能是有局限的，他是领队，来协调、召集。
This is not to say that it is up to him to make decisions, because anyone's scientific understanding may be limited, and he is the team leader who coordinates and convenes.
DeepTech：这次疫情中出现了双黄连等事件。
DeepTech: There have been incidents in the outbreak, including Shuanghuanglian.
为何中国出现急病乱投医的现象和心理这么强烈？陈铮鸣：涉及的因素可能有多方面，包括一些文化的因素。
Why is there such a strong medical phenomenon and psychology in China? Chen rattles: There may be many factors involved, including some cultural factors.
其一，媒体喜欢捕风捉影，当然在国外也有这种情况。
First, the media likes to play by the wind, and certainly abroad.
其二，科学家对具体事物的把控也很重要。
Second, the control of specific things by scientists is also important.
英国的科学家有许多传媒方面的训练，比如怎么面对媒体，怎么进行新闻发布，也有主管部门审核和把关。
British scientists are trained in many aspects of the media, such as how to deal with the media, how to carry out press releases, but also competent departments to review and check.
把故事讲好，分寸把握很重要，如把握不当，就会产生误导。
It is important to tell the story well and keep it in proportion. If you misunderstand it, it will be misleading.
其三，特殊时期，政府和民众希望有好消息。
Third, in exceptional times, governments and citizens hope for good news.
由于这方面的压力和需求，研究人员就可能走捷径。
As a result of this pressure and demand, researchers may take shortcuts.
其四就是利害冲突。
The fourth is the conflict of interests.
比方说我开了一家药厂，我同时也是首席科学家，我来推销这个东西可能就会涉及利益目的。
For example, I run a pharmaceutical factory, and I'm also a chief scientist, and I might have an interest in marketing it.
在国外，对这种学术规范很严格。
Abroad, such academic norms are very strict.
最后就是文化。
Finally, culture.
中国民间比较相信偏方、秘方。
Chinese folk believe in folk prescription and secret recipe.
历史上欧美也有传统医学和各种根据经验产生的疗法。
Historically, there have also been traditional medicine and a variety of experiential therapies in Europe and the United States.
但近几十年来，通过采取科学的方法来验证，淘汰糟粕，去伪存真，现在的治疗就很科学化和规范化。
But in recent decades, through the adoption of scientific methods to verify, eliminate dregs, eliminate false, now the treatment is very scientific and standardized.
中医药是个宝库，但要进一步发扬光大，走向世界，需要有更多的科学证据，尤其是严格的随机对照临床试验的证据。
Chinese medicine is a treasure house, but more scientific evidence, especially from rigorous randomized controlled clinical trials, is needed to take it further and reach the world.
