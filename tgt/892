本报记者 郭阳琛 石英婧 上海报道“去年春节因为上班在家就待了三天，此后一整年没回，今年因特殊情况又临时取消回家计划，老家的亲人朋友们我们明年见吧！”1月22日，在合肥南高铁站附近的一家汉堡店，武汉大学医学生张力（化名）下定决定返回武汉，发出这条微信。
"After staying at home for three days last year, I did not return home for the whole year, so I will see my family and friends next year," said Guo Yangchen, a Shanghai-based reporter.
武汉新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎刚刚“冒出苗头”时，张力没有过于重视，也是“该吃吃吃该喝喝，出门也不会戴口罩”。
Wuhan new coronavirus infection of pneumonia just "emerging", tension did not pay too much attention, is "eat, eat, drink, go out will not wear a mask."
有一天，张力在武汉大学人民医院急诊科值夜班时，听到见习老师提到“今天白天有个肺炎患者也不确定是不是新型肺炎”，虽然那名患者已经转院去了华中科技大学同济医学院附属协和医院，但他当时后背仍有些发凉，“那大概是我在医院离新型肺炎疑似病例患者最近的一次”。
One day, Tension was on night duty at the emergency department of Wuhan University's People's Hospital and heard the trainee teacher mention that "a patient with pneumonia today is not sure if it's the new pneumonia," although the patient had been transferred to Tongji Medical College Concorde Hospital in Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
与疑似新型肺炎患者“擦肩而过”后，平时身体硬朗、酷爱健身的张力，也在一次聚餐后觉得嗓子有些不舒服，甚至开始咳嗽起来。
With suspected new pneumonia patients "pass by", usually the body is strong, love the tension of fitness, also after a dinner feel a bit uncomfortable throat, even began to cough.
“我平时抵抗力挺强的，难道自己也中招了？”吃了两天药之后，张力的感冒症状逐渐消失。
"I usually have a strong resistance, do you admit it?" After two days of medicine, tension of the cold symptoms gradually disappear.
但这个小插曲也让他打心底开始关注这场有扩大趋势的疫情，口罩逐渐也成了他的日常必需品。
But the episode also brought him to the bottom of his heart to focus on the growing trend of the epidemic, and masks gradually became his daily necessity.
“新型肺炎始发地是汉口，随着疫情越来越严重，武昌戴口罩的人也与日俱增。
"The origin of the new type of pneumonia is Hankou. As the epidemic worsens, so does the number of people wearing masks in Wuchang.
”张力身边的很多医学前辈也开始奔赴对抗新型肺炎疫情的前线。
Many of the medical veterans around the tension are also on the front lines of the fight against the new pneumonia epidemic.
重症医学科7位勇士奔赴前线驰援金银潭武汉市医疗救治中心、呼吸与危重症医学科女医生张旃副教授书写现代版“与夫书”……“这些在医院见习时的老师，虽然有些不曾相识，但他们忘我的精神让我钦佩不已，也成为我在医学上的精神导师。
| | | | | | | | | | | Chandrake Chandrake Chandrake, a woman physician in Wuhan City Medical Center, Respiratory and Critical Medicine, wrote a modern edition of Chandrake's book... "Although some of these novices were unknown to me, their selfless spirit impressed me and became my spiritual teacher in medicine.
但另一方面，我和周围的其他同学每天在医院也都有些提心吊胆，担心自己可能被传染新型肺炎。
On the other hand, my classmates and I worry about being infected with new pneumonia every day at the hospital.
”张力如是说。
"said tension.
去年春节在家就待了3天，张力今年原本计划多在家几天跑跑亲戚，便早早买了1月23日到济南的高铁票。
Tension had planned to stay home for a few more days this year, so she bought the high-speed train ticket to Jinan on January 23.
前几天，他猜测武汉可能会因新型肺炎疫情而“封城”，便改签到了1月22日。
A few days ago, he speculated that Wuhan might be "closed" due to the new pneumonia epidemic, so he signed to January 22.
当天中午，张力在合肥南站等候换乘时收到家乡聊城的消息。
At noon that day, tension in Hefei South Station waiting for transfer when receiving the home town of Liaocheng news.
“他们建议我这种长期在武汉的人员，回家后最好不要出门，每天量体温向卫生部门汇报。
"They advised me, a longtime Wuhan resident, to stay home and report my body temperature to the health authorities every day.
”这时候，张力开始认真思量自己的去留，究竟会对家乡造成什么影响。
"At this time, tension began to seriously consider their own go-and-go, after all, the impact on home.
“反正我过年也不能串门了，而且亲朋好友可能会顾忌我，不能跟我一起吃饭、聊天，那我干脆别回去了，让大家安心过年吧！”随后，独自一人的张力啃着汉堡包，将合肥到济南的车票改成了合肥到武汉。
"Anyway, I can not visit the New Year, and friends and relatives may scruple me, I can not eat and chat with me, then I simply do not go back, let everyone ease the New Year!
“这是我吃过的印象最深的一顿汉堡。
"It was the most impressive hamburger I've ever had.
”张力说。
"said tension.
再次踏上武汉这片土地，张力发现虽然仅仅离开12小时，但街头已经空旷了不少，路人们大多戴着各式口罩行色匆匆。
Again set foot on this piece of Wuhan, tension found that although only 12 hours away, but the streets have been quite empty, most people wearing a variety of masks hurry.
“武汉街头的药房、便利店口罩基本卖脱销了，少许药店还有存货，但也都限量供应。
"Wuhan street pharmacies, convenience store masks sold out of stock, a few pharmacies are still in stock, but are also limited supply.
我也赶忙去超市买了方便面、饼干、面包、矿泉水等生活必需品，很多货架已经是半空状态了。
I also rushed to the supermarket to buy instant noodles, biscuits, bread, mineral water and other necessities, many shelves are already in a state of semi-empty.
”1月23日一早醒来，张力看到了武汉10时开始“封城”的消息，也收到了父母的微信视频电话。
"Early January 23 woke up, tension saw Wuhan 10 hours to start the" closure "of the news, but also received a video message from parents.
“听说武汉的最新情况，父亲有些担心，却再次表示支持我不回家过年；母亲则反常地不怎么说话，只是略带哽咽地说，‘孩子要照顾好自己’，也许她自己已经偷偷哭了好多次了。
"Hearing of the latest situation in Wuhan, my father was worried but once again expressed his support for me not going home for the New Year, while the mother said unnaturally little, just with a lump in her mouth, 'Take care of yourself,' and perhaps she herself has cried many times.
”“内心深处还是挺难受的，医学生平时很忙，要在医院和学校实验室两头跑，老早就盼着春节假期回家看看父母。
"" Deep down, medical students are busy running around hospitals and school labs looking forward to coming home for the Spring Festival holiday.
”张力告诉记者，学校放假较早，大多数同学已经回家过年了，目前身边只有一个室友和几名师弟，也都是差不多的原因选择留在武汉。
Tension told reporters that the school holiday earlier, most students have gone home for the New Year, there is only a roommate and a few brothers, but also the same reasons choose to stay in Wuhan.
“这几天准备待在学校里，尽量不去人流密集的地方，在宿舍弄弄论文，每天坚持去宿舍楼下的篮球场打打篮球锻炼身体。
"I plan to stay in school these days, try not to crowded places, play papers in the dormitory, and play basketball every day to exercise.
除夕就打算和舍友一边看春晚，一边在宿舍煮火锅吃，再和爸妈视频聊聊天，感觉也挺不错。
New Year's Eve and roommate to watch the Spring Festival Gala, while cooking hot pot in the dormitory, and then chat with Mom and Dad video chat, feeling pretty good.
”张力表示。
