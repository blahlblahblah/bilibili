”湖北省黄冈市市民阮祥银带着“熊猫血”妻子赴汉分娩。
Huanggang City, Hubei Province, took his wife, Panda Blood, to China to give birth.
孩子顺利出生后，他们却卡在一张通行证上，武汉当地也没有酒店能够接收他们。
After the baby was born, they got stuck on a pass and there was no local hotel in Wuhan to receive them.
阮祥银只能带着岳母、妻子和刚出生的儿子住在车上。
Nguyen Xiang Yin had to live in the car with his mother-in-law, wife and newborn son.
2020年2月24日晚，在武汉市洪山区防疫指挥部的协调安排下，阮祥银住进了该辖区内的一家酒店，结束了数天车上的生活。
On the night of February 24, 2020, under the coordination of Wuhan Hongshan epidemic prevention command, Ruan Xiang Yin moved into a hotel in the district, ending several days on the bus.
以下是阮祥银的口述：我是黄冈市红安县人，今年31岁，从事汽车行业，大女儿今年2岁了，去年妻子又怀了孕。
I am a 31-year-old native of Hongan County, Huanggang City. My eldest daughter is 2 years old and my wife was pregnant last year.
但我们喜忧参半。
But we are mixed.
我的妻子是“熊猫血”（Rh血型），生育本来就是很麻烦的事。
My wife is "panda blood" (Rh blood type), childbirth is already very troublesome matter.
临到分娩，没想到又遇到新冠肺炎这么大的事。
The birth, did not expect to encounter the new crown pneumonia so big matter.
我们到红安县医院和黄冈市医院产检的时候，医生们明确告诉我们，整个地区都缺这个血，怕出意外，建议我们还是到武汉来待产。
We went to Hongan County Hospital and Huanggang City Hospital, doctors clearly told us that the whole area is short of this blood, afraid of an accident, advised us to come to Wuhan to give birth.
无奈之下，我只能带着妻子出城。
But I had to take my wife out of town.
出城前，我们先在当地政府开了通行证，其实就是一个介绍信，说明我们现在的情况和不得不去武汉就诊的理由。
Before leaving the city, we issued a laissez-passer at the local government. Actually, it was a letter of introduction explaining our current situation and the reason why we had to go to Wuhan.
2020年2月4日，我们准备去同济医院待产——因为我们家大女儿就是在同济生的。
On February 4, 2020, we are going to Tongji Hospital to give birth - because our eldest daughter is in Tongji University.
但是看到同济医院基本只接收新冠肺炎患者的状况，我们决定去湖北省妇幼保健院进行产检。
However, seeing that Tongji Hospital only accepted the situation of new crown pneumonia patients, we decided to go to Hubei Maternal and Child Health Center for physical check-up.
当天产检很顺利，拿着红安县方面开的通行证，我们也顺利出了武汉，回到家中。
The day of the inspection is very smooth, holding the red An County Pass, we also smooth out of Wuhan, back home.
2020年2月12日，眼看着预产期将近，我和岳母又带着妻子去了武汉。
On February 12, 2020, just before the due date, my mother-in-law and I took my wife to Wuhan.
那几天，妻子住在产房里，我和岳母就在车上“凑合”。
A few days later, my wife lived in the delivery room, my mother-in-law and I were in the car.
20日上午10点，儿子出生了。
At 10 a.m. on the 20th, my son was born.
其实省妇幼保健院也没有“熊猫血”的储备，但好在母子平安，一切都很顺利。
In fact, the provincial maternal and child health care hospital also did not "panda blood" reserves, but fortunately mother and child safety, everything is smooth.
那几天，我和岳母可以在三楼的病房里照顾妻子，好歹有了住的地方。
On those days, my mother-in-law and I were able to take care of my wife in the third floor ward and have a place to live.
孩子刚刚出生3天。
The child was just three days old.
受访者供图23日上午9点多，妻子的各项检查都出来后，查房医生便通知我们出院。
The interviewee showed that at 9: 00 a.m. on the 23rd, the check-up doctor told us to leave the hospital after all his wife's examinations had come out.
省妇幼保健院的床位也很紧张，我们也非常理解。
The beds in the provincial MCH are also very tight, and we understand them very well.
中午，我们4个人便决定开车回家。
At noon, the four of us decided to drive home.
没想到的是，我们出不去了。
Unexpectedly, we couldn't get out.
当天下午1点，我们开车来到青龙收费站，被疫情防控人员拦了下来。
At 1: 00 p.m. that day, we drove to the Qinglong toll station, was stopped by the epidemic control personnel.
我也给他们看了介绍信，但被告知只能用“武汉出的通行证”。
I also showed them a letter of introduction, but was told to use only "Wuhan Pass."
即便妻子抱着刚出生的孩子给他们看，还是沟通无效，我们只能作罢。
Even if the wife holds the newborn child to them, or the communication is ineffective, we have to stop.
今天凌晨3点，我们决定再去试试，还是被拦了下来。
At 3 a.m. this morning, we decided to try again, but we were stopped.
我们没有任何办法，只能回到医院的停车场，3个大人和一个刚出生的孩子，在车上随便睡了2个小时。
We had no choice but to return to the hospital parking lot, where three adults and a new baby slept for two hours.
我的车是普通大众车，车内空间很小，空气也不好，孩子不停地哭，我们3个大人急得没有办法，除了跟着他哭，也没有什么能做的。
My car was an ordinary Volkswagen, with little room and bad air, and the children were crying, and the three of us were too anxious to do anything but cry with him.
油箱见底，阮祥银一家不得不就近找到加油站加油。
The gas tank bottomed out and the Ruan Xiangyin family had to find nearby gas station to refuel.

看到这个情况，我们决定在武汉先安顿下来。
Seeing this situation, we decided to settle down in Wuhan first.
但我们对武汉不熟，在医院附近找了十几家酒店，要么关门，要么是被征用的酒店。
But we are not familiar with Wuhan, in the vicinity of the hospital found a dozen hotels, either closed or requisitioned hotel.
我们也去找了当地的派出所，民警们的态度特别好，特别热心，开着车带我们去了一家专门安置滞留外地人的酒店。
We also went to the local police station, the attitude of the police is particularly good, especially warm-hearted, driving us to a special hotel for stranded foreigners.
但现在的情况谁又能说清楚要住多久？酒店方面一听说我儿子刚刚出生，也不敢接收，怕孩子太小，时间长了，出了问题谁也付不起责任。
But who knows how long it will take? The hotel didn't dare to accept my son when they heard he was just born, for fear the baby would be too young and too long to pay for anything that went wrong.
今天下午，我们去了武昌区政府，听说武昌区防控指挥部就在里面办公，我在门口碰到了一个也想办理通行证的人。
This afternoon, we went to Wuchang District Government, I heard that Wuchang District Control Command on the inside of the office, I met at the door also want to apply for a pass.
他说，他是重庆人，徒步一个多小时赶到这里。
He said he was from Chongqing and had been here on foot for more than an hour.
但保安经过电话与里面的工作人员沟通后，告知我们现在办不了通行证。
However, the security guard through the telephone and the staff inside the communication, told us that we can not now get a pass.
后来，我们又通过电话与工作人员沟通。
Later, we communicated with the staff by telephone.
对方告诉我，提交所在地接收证明、医院健康证明和离汉申请后，可以办理通行证。
The other party told me that after submitting the local acceptance certificate, the hospital health certificate and the application for leaving the Han Dynasty, I can apply for a pass.
但是后来她发现，省妇幼保健院所属辖区是洪山区，无法为我们办理通行证。
But later, she found that the province's maternal and child health care area is Hongshan area, unable to obtain a pass for us.
我们只能再到洪山区政府碰碰运气，2月24日晚上，在洪山区防控指挥部协调下，珞南派出所民警给我们在辖区内找到一家可以接收的酒店。
We can only go to the Hongshan government to take a chance, February 24, under the coordination of the Hongshan District Command, Lahornan police station for us to find a jurisdiction to find a hotel.
民警很热心，叮嘱我们尽量不要外出，并告诉我们，社区方面可以给我们采购物品。
The police are very warm-hearted, advised us to try not to go out, and told us that the community can buy things for us.
现在，我们总算不用住在车里了。
Now, we don't have to stay in the car anymore.
但坦白说，孩子还小，我们还是想尽快回到老家。
But to be honest, we still want to get back home as soon as we are young.
到家以后，居家隔离还是定点隔离，怎么样都好。
Home after the isolation or fixed-point isolation, no matter how good.
