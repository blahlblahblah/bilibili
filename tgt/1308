燃财经（ID:rancaijing）原创作者 | 孔明明编辑 | 周昶帆在抗击新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎中，看不见的敌人除了无形的病毒，还有人们心里的创伤和危机。
Former founder and founder of Finance (ID: Rancaijing) & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; In the fight against pneumonia infected with the new coronavirus, invisible enemies include not only the invisible virus, but also the trauma and crisis in people's minds.
昼夜连续工作、因确诊而感到恐慌、被隔离无法出门、因为信息轰炸而陷入持续的焦虑和失眠中……疫情之下，一线的医疗人员、被确诊和隔离的患者、高度警惕的普通大众，他们都有可能陷入到心理危机中。
Round-the-clock work, panic over diagnosis, isolation, constant anxiety and sleeplessness as a result of the bombing of information... With the outbreak, front-line health workers, patients diagnosed and isolated, and the highly vigilant general public are all at risk of falling into psychological crisis.
国家层面，针对这次疫情的心理危机干预已经启动。
At the national level, psychological crisis interventions have been initiated in response to the epidemic.
1月27日，国家卫健委疾控局发布《新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情紧急心理危机干预指导原则》，要求将心理危机干预纳入疫情防控整体部署。
On January 27, the National Bureau of Health Care and Prevention issued the Guiding Principles of Emergency Psychological Crisis Intervention for New Coronavirus Infections, which require that psychological crisis intervention be integrated into the overall deployment of the epidemic.
武汉市精神卫生中心和湖北省心理咨询协会均已上线专门的疫情心理援助热线。
Both Wuhan Mental Health Center and Hubei Psychological Counseling Association have set up special epidemic psychological assistance hotlines.
社会和企业也在行动。
Society and business are also on the move.
北京师范大学、北京大学等高校开通了针对这次疫情的心理支持热线，许多社会自发组织的心理援助小组也开始提供免费的心理服务。
Beijing Normal University, Peking University and other institutions of higher learning opened a psychological support hotline for the epidemic, many of the social self-organized psychological assistance groups also began to provide free psychological services.
互联网企业中，京东、微博、壹心理、简单心理等也已经上线了疫情心理服务专线。
Internet enterprises, Jingdong, Weibo, one psychological, simple psychological and so on has also been on-line psychological service lines.
主动参与社会自发心理援助团队的北京心理咨询师Joshua告诉燃财经，这次疫情重大，不仅是对一线工作人员的一次考验，也是整个社会范围内的一次灾难，它会导致整个社会出现同时期的巨大心理创伤，并会持续相当长的一段时间。
Josua, a Beijing psychologist who volunteered to participate in the social and psychological support team, told Flames Finance that the outbreak was a test not only for frontline workers but also for society as a whole, and that it would lead to great psychological trauma of the same period and would continue for a considerable period of time.
在这次疫情中，种种状况引发的社会心理创伤问题将会是一场需要更多时间应对的漫长战役。
In this case, the psychosocial trauma of the conditions will be a long battle that will take more time to deal with.
疫情之下的心理危机在湖北孝感市一家卫生所工作的李医生已经快要扛不住了。
The psychological crisis under the epidemic in Hubei Xiaoyan City a health clinic work Dr. Li is already nearly unable to carry.
李医生12月21日接到通知，要对发热病人进行特殊对待，自那时起他就一直处在焦虑状态中。
Dr. Lee was told on December 21 that he needed special treatment for febrile patients and has been in a state of anxiety since then.
最近一周他接触到了大量从武汉返乡回家的病人，医院里的医生只有口罩防护，其他的物资都非常紧缺。
In the past week, he has come into contact with a large number of patients returning home from Wuhan, where doctors are protected only by masks and other supplies are in short supply.
外界嘈杂的信息持续干扰，加之对未来的担忧，李医生每天都睡不着觉，“看不到前途”。
With the constant distraction of noisy outside information and the fear of the future, Dr. Lee can't sleep every day.
有流离在外地的武汉人表示，最近碰到一系列事情，被航空公司拒载、被民宿拒绝入住等，有家辗转难回，又担心家乡亲人，他心里只有持续的愤怒、疲惫和紧张，经常一个人偷偷哭泣，也看不到未来在哪，时常感到绝望。
Wuhan people who have been displaced in other parts of the world say they have recently encountered a series of incidents, such as airline refusals, people refused to live in, etc., family toss and turn back, and fear of home relatives, his heart only continued anger, fatigue and tension, often a person secretly crying, not see where the future, often despair.
身在北京从事媒体工作的林然虽然没有去到一线采访，但工作原因，她也需要持续关注疫情信息，并要对信息分类整理。
Although Lin Ran, who works in the media in Beijing, did not go to the front-line interview, but the reason for her work, she also needs to continue to pay attention to the epidemic information, and to classify information.
虽然看到一些援助动态会让她心安，但她依然小心谨慎地采购了大量生活用品囤积起来，待在家里不敢出门。
Though she was reassured to see some aid dynamics, she was careful to stock up on household items and stay at home.
晚上她持续睡不着觉，甚至一度面临崩溃。
At night she could not sleep and even faced collapse.
心理疏导志愿者朱琳告诉燃财经，经过接触她发现很多人目前都处在焦虑、恐慌的状态中。
Zhu Lin, a volunteer with psychological counseling, told Flaming Finance that on contact she found that many people are in a state of anxiety and panic.
因为在家无法出门，只能通过网络获取外界信息，大量信息轰炸之后，尤其是夹杂着很多谣言和中伤，很多人长期处于精神紧绷中。
Unable to go out of their homes, they can only get outside information via the Internet. After a lot of information bombing, especially with a lot of rumors and slander, many people are in a constant state of mental tension.
医护人员更是在对抗疫情的前线，工作负担重、工作时间长，情绪被刻意压制，无处宣泄。
Health care workers are in the front line of the fight against the epidemic, a heavy workload, long working hours, deliberately suppressed emotions, nowhere to vent.
朱琳是一名从业6年多的全职心理咨询师。
She has been a full-time counselor for more than six years.
1月24日下午，在听到越来越多的疫情消息后，她和身边的朋友一起组建了一个心理援助团队，现在有国内志愿者600多人，海外志愿者40多人，全天24小时在线，为武汉地区一线医护人员及家属、确诊及疑似患者及家属提供免费远程心理疏导服务。
On the afternoon of January 24, after hearing more and more news of the epidemic, she and her friends formed a psychological support team, which now has more than 600 volunteers in China and more than 40 volunteers overseas.
“刚开始就想在网上和一群志同道合的人一起尽一份力、帮大家缓解心理压力”，随着加入的人越来越多、影响越来越大，朱琳在感动之余，也开启了几天只睡三四个小时的超负荷工作运转。
"At first she wanted to do her part online with a group of like-minded people to relieve some of the mental stress." As more and more people joined in, Jolie was moved and started working three or four hours of overwork for a few days.
Joshua也表示，在他目前接触的案例中，大多数求助者来自大型医院的一线工作人员，他们超负荷运转，身体和心理持续处在强大的压力之下，出现情绪失控甚至幻觉。
Joshua also said that in the cases he was currently in contact with, most of the clients came from front-line staff in large hospitals, who were overworked, under constant physical and psychological stress and experiencing emotional outbursts and even hallucinations.
也有人因为看到了其他人太多的绝望和无助，自己也受情绪影响，也有人产生了某种程度的绝望甚至自杀念头。
Others see too much hopelessness and hopelessness in others, are affected by their own emotions, and there is a degree of despair and even suicidal thinking.
身体疲惫、物资紧缺、情绪蔓延，很多人甚至连吃饭的时间都没有。
Physical exhaustion, material shortages, emotional contagion, many people do not even have time to eat.
再加上灾难面前，患者整体的恐慌苦恼、医患之间的紧张关系，让整个医院氛围趋向于极端。
Coupled with the disaster, patients as a whole panic and distress, the tension between doctors and patients, so that the whole hospital atmosphere tends to extreme.
对于心理求助者来说，这些状况营造出了“类似于末日的感觉”。
For the psychopath, these conditions create a "doomsday feeling."
“过度的恐慌心理，会让人原有的个人心理失去秩序，产生除了恐慌心理之外的其他的一些亚情感，很多负面情绪都会被激发出来，这些情绪反而会给抵抗疫情带来副作用。
"Excessive panic disorder can cause people to lose their original psychological order, produce in addition to panic, other than some sub-emotions, many negative emotions will be aroused, these emotions will bring the side-effects of the epidemic.
”Joshua说。
'said Joshua.
疫情之下，在病毒蔓延的同时，负面情绪和心理问题也在蔓延，如果没有专业辅助和救援，相关群体的心理创伤可能会永久留下。
In the context of the epidemic, negative emotional and psychological problems are spreading alongside the spread of the virus, and without professional support and assistance, the psychological trauma of the groups concerned may remain permanently.
“心理人”在行动在朱琳组织的心理疏导志愿者团队中，武汉的100多位心理咨询师按区域分成了10个组，湖北省武汉之外的地区有60多位心理咨询师按区域分成了8个组。
Psychologists in Wuhan have been divided into 10 groups by region, and more than 60 counsellors in areas outside Wuhan, Hubei Province, have been divided into eight groups by region.
北京、上海、广东、重庆等其他省市的450多位心理咨询师按区域分成十几个小组，海外组也有40多位成员被分成了2组。
More than 450 counsellors in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong and Chongqing were divided into dozens of groups by region and more than 40 members from overseas groups into two groups.
新的人员仍然在不断加入进来。
New personnel continue to be brought in.
志愿者张雨是一名二级心理咨询证书持有者。
Zhang Yu is a secondary psychological consultation certificate holder.
在疫情爆发时，她一边焦虑一边着急，希望可以帮湖北做点什么。
When the outbreak broke out, she was worried and anxious, hoping to do something for Hubei.
1月26日，经过朋友介绍，她被拉入了“湖北省心理咨询师协会官方工作团”微信群，并从1月27日开始受领咨询任务。
January 26, after friends introduced, she was drawn into the "official mission of the Association of Psychological Counsellors in Hubei Province" micro-group, and from January 27 began to receive advisory missions.
在她加入的微信群里，每天由工作组统筹安排值班小组和值班时间，24小时都有热线接线员，从上午9点到晚上9点有咨询需求分派员，各小组心理咨询师在本小组值班时间待命随时接受咨询任务。
In the micro-groups to which she is a member, shift teams and working hours are coordinated by working groups on a daily basis, hotline operators are available on a 24-hour basis, advisory staff are available from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. and teams of counsellors are on call for counselling during the team's working hours.
有志愿者表示：“这一天，我聊了陌生人48位，建了8个工作组，进了24个群，出了十几个通告和文件，喝了3杯水，走了100来步，但是（比起一线抗击疫情）这又算得了什么？”被援助者对心理咨询志愿者表达感谢来源 /受访者心理咨询师程心告诉燃财经，这种紧急重大事件的心理援助对咨询师本人也是一种考验。
"On this day, I chatted with 48 strangers, set up eight working groups, entered 24 groups, issued more than a dozen notices and documents, drank three glasses of water and walked about 100 paces, but expressed gratitude to the volunteer counselors, Cheng Xinxin told the Financial Times that psychological assistance for such an emergency was also a test for the counselor himself.
在提供援助的同时，一些咨询师可能会被咨询者的负面情绪淹没和裹挟，这就需要咨询师在接受这份工作之前自我评估和判断，否则咨询师本人也会产生心理创伤。
While providing assistance, some consultants may be overwhelmed and intimidated by the negativity of the person being consulted, which requires self-assessment and judgement before accepting the job, otherwise the consultant will also be traumatized.
“但我还是愿意尽我的一份力，因为有人需要我们的帮助，尤其是在这种天灾面前，只要每个人提供一点力所能及的帮助，就可能会带来好的连锁反应。
"But I am willing to do my part, because there are people who need our help, especially in the face of such a disaster, as long as everyone provides a little help within their power, it can have a good ripple effect.
”程心说。
'said Cheng.
尽管客观上一方有需求，另一方也有帮助的意愿，但朱琳告诉燃财经，她们初期的心理工作展开得并不顺利。
Despite the need for objectivity and the willingness of the other side to help, Ms Jolie told Flaming Finance that their early psychological work was not going well.
“现在的问题是民众焦虑，找不到我们，我们团队着急，接触不到更多的民众，而且即便接触到了，大部分人不太了解心理咨询是干什么的，尤其在我们主动联系他们时，他们会表示拒绝，可能是因为不信任。
"The problem is that people are anxious and can't find us, our team is anxious, we can't reach more people, and if they do, most people don't know much about what counselling is about, and especially when we contact them, they say no, probably because of mistrust.
”为此，他们派出了志愿者团队，主动联系当地社区，为更多人提供帮助。
To that end, they have sent volunteer teams to reach out to local communities to help more people.
为了应对疫情地区的心理援助需求，互联网企业如简单心理、壹心理等专业心理服务平台也在前几天连续紧急加班，上线了专门的互助心理援助热线和服务。
In order to respond to the needs of psychological assistance in epidemic areas, Internet enterprises such as simple psychological, psychological and other professional psychological services platform in the last few days also consecutive emergency overtime, on-line specialized psychological assistance hotline and services.
京东、微博等企业也开设了专门的疫情心理服务通道。
Enterprises such as Jingdong and Weibo have also opened special channels for epidemic psychological services.
Joshua是在1月20日开始陆续被朋友拉入了几个自发组织的心理援助群，有12年心理咨询与辅导从业经验的Joshua 表示，在大的灾难面前，很多人会选择逃避或者极端对抗。
Joshua, who has 12 years of experience in counseling and counseling, says many people will opt for avoidance or extreme confrontation in the face of a major disaster.
但在这个过程中，如果大众的情绪能被正确理解和引导，“这些事件反而会成为他们人生中的一个祝福，可以让人在经历中得到学习成长，甚至生命境界能得到很大的提升。
But in the process, if the public's emotions are properly understood and guided, "these events will instead become a blessing in their lives, so that people can learn to grow in the experience, even the realm of life can be greatly improved.
”1月27日，国家层面也启动了心理危机干预机制，正规军入场。
On January 27, a psychological crisis intervention mechanism was launched at the national level, bringing in the regular army.
国家卫健委疾控局发布《新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情紧急心理危机干预指导原则》，要求将心理危机干预纳入疫情防控整体部署。
The National Bureau of Health Care and Prevention issued the "Guidelines for Emergency Psychological Crisis Intervention for New Coronavirus Infections," which require that psychological crisis intervention be integrated into the overall epidemic prevention and control plan.
武汉市精神卫生中心、湖北省心理咨询协会、北京师范大学、北京大学等也相继推出了专门的心理援助专线。
The Wuhan Mental Health Center, Hubei Psychological Counseling Association, Beijing Normal University and Peking University have also launched special psychological assistance lines.
刚开始的漫长战役这场关于心理援助的战役才刚刚开始。
The first long battle, the battle for psychological aid, had only just begun.
“按照专家目前的判断，疫情大规模爆发在2月中旬之前，真正的心理救助在此之后需要将近几个月到半年，甚至更长的时间去帮助他们慢慢恢复正常，开始有爱、有盼望、有信心去面对当下的生活”，同样参与此次心理援助、具有2000个小时个人心理辅导经验和应急辅导资格认证的心理咨询师Salinna说，“不仅仅是武汉和湖北，全国其实都在经历某种程度的心理创伤，包括对政府的信任、区域之间的信任、人与人之间的信任等”。
"According to experts' current assessment, the outbreak occurred on a large scale before mid-February, after which real psychological assistance will take months to half a year, or even longer, to help them return to normal and start loving, hopeful and confident lives in the present, said Salinna, a counselor with 2,000 hours of personal counseling experience and emergency counseling.
朱琳建议，对于普通民众，应该要尽量“减少信息输入”、“安排好作息时间”、“增加娱乐活动”等，她希望大家在和别人沟通时多表达鼓励与支持，如果实在无法排解情绪，及时寻求专业帮助。
For the general public, she suggests, try to "cut back on information input," "schedule your bedtime" and "increase recreational activities." She hopes you'll show more encouragement and support when communicating with others, and seek professional help if you really can't defuse your emotions.
对于紧张、疲惫的一线工作人员，朱琳建议他们要劳逸结合，一定要留出时间和别人聊工作以外的事情，比如可以拿出休息时间的十分之一和咨询师简单沟通，缓解焦虑。
For nervous, jaded frontline workers, Ms. Jolie recommends taking time out to talk about things other than work, such as a tenth of a break and simple communication with a counselor to ease their anxieties.
如果仍然无法面对病人的死亡，不断产生恐惧压抑的情绪，要及时寻求专业的心理干预。
If still unable to face the death of the patient, constant fear of depression, to seek timely professional psychological intervention.
Joshua 也提到，在当前情况下，普通大众最好多对朋友、家人说一些鼓励和赞美等正向鼓励的话。
Joshua also noted that under the current circumstances, it would be best for the general public to offer positive encouragement in the form of encouragement and praise to friends and family.
他认为，失眠焦虑是身体的基本反应，可以尝试吃一些基本的助眠药物解决失眠。
He believes that insomnia anxiety is the body's basic response, can try to take some basic sleep medicine to solve insomnia.
平时可以多保持室内的基本运动，多做一些能让自己安静下来的事情，比如读书、听音乐等，合理饮食，保证蔬菜和水果的足够摄入。
At ordinary times, you can keep the basic indoor exercise, do more things that can calm you down, such as reading books, listening to music, eating a reasonable diet, and ensuring an adequate intake of vegetables and fruits.
Salinna则建议，在居家封闭时间里，可以控制电子产品的使用时间，给亲密的人高质量的陪伴，制定切实可行的阶段性目标，必要时寻求专业的帮助。
Salinna advises controlling the amount of time spent using electronics during home closures, giving close people high-quality companionship, setting realistic milestones and seeking professional help when necessary.
她还建议尝试管理自己的负面情绪，并激发有益于身体的积极情绪，比如欢乐、信心、盼望、勇气和爱等。
She also advises experimenting with managing your negative emotions and stimulating positive emotions such as joy, confidence, hope, courage and love that are beneficial to the body.
Joshua表示，在目前状况下，湖北甚至全国人民的心理问题都需要人们真正去关注，动用社会、国家的力量去帮助前线的医生群体、患者群体、患者家庭，以及疫情影响严重地区的人们，同时也需要一个立体、权威、系统性的治疗方案和辅导方案，让这些人能够尽快走出心理阴影。
Under current conditions, the psychological problems in Hubei and even in the whole country need people's real attention, using society and the state to help doctors, patients, families and people in the worst-affected areas of the epidemic, as well as a three-dimensional, authoritative and systematic treatment program and counseling program to get them out of the psychological shadows as soon as possible.
朱琳观察，从这次危机中的民众反应和需求角度看，在遇到突发事件时，大众会出现恐慌心理，呈现焦虑状态，很多人有躯体反应，需要专业心理援助缓解焦虑情绪会变成一种常态。
Judith observed that, from the point of view of the population's response and needs in this crisis, panic and anxiety are common in times of emergency, and many people have physical reactions that require professional psychological assistance to ease anxiety.
她建议，各个城市应该建立一支更加专业的危机干预团队，也希望政府把对大众的危机干预和心理援助工作放入日常工作中。
She suggested that cities should set up a more professional crisis intervention team and hoped that the government would put crisis intervention and psychological assistance in the work of the general public in their daily work.
