在过去一个月中数以亿计的中国人被动地参加了一场远程办公的大规模社会实验疫情期间，员工远程办公，澳大利亚人工智能公司Appen在上海的办公室空无一人。
Hundreds of millions of Chinese have passively participated in a massive social experiment in telecommuting over the past month, leaving Apple's Shanghai office empty.

Photo / Interviewee: report on telecommuting laboratory observations Our correspondent / Yang Zhijie was published in 2020.3.9, issue No. 938 of China News Weekly. During the Spring Festival 2020, there are more than 300 million telecommuting workers and more than 18 million enterprises in China.
” 艾媒咨询的一项数据显示。
A data show from media consultation.
“宅在家”办公，曾是很多人的梦想。
"Home" office, has been the dream of many people.
收到公司远程办公的通知，王城一度充满期待——不用在早晚高峰挤地铁，也不用每天洗头收拾，更不用操心在公司中午吃什么。
At one point, Wang was waiting to hear from his company about telecommuting -- not squeezing the subway in the morning and evening, cleaning up every day and not worrying about what to eat at noon.
但是复工第一周，他发现，现实远比想象的复杂。
But in his first week back, he found that reality was far more complicated than he had imagined.
团队开视频会议，动辄卡顿和时延，一旦错过关键信息，就听不懂对方在讲什么。
Teams hold videoconferences, are prone to carton and time delays, and once key information is missed, they cannot understand what the other person is saying.
在公司几句话说清楚的事，现在每天要花费更多时间，反复在语音通话里跟同事解释。
What the company says clearly in a few words now takes more time each day to explain to colleagues over and over in a voice call.
语音还没讲完，聊天软件里又多了几个@自己的信息。
Voice is not finished, chat software in a few more @ their own information.
儿子不用去幼儿园，随时还会冲进屋里，央求陪他玩耍。
Son does not have to go to kindergarten, will always rush into the house, begging to accompany him to play.
突发的疫情，颠覆了很多中国人的办公方式。
The outbreak of the epidemic has upended the way many Chinese people work.
2月3日复工第一天，钉钉上有2亿人开启在家办公模式。
On the first day of work, on 3 February, 200 million people were nailed to work from home.
由于瞬间访问量过多，钉钉、企业微信、飞书等在线办公平台招架不住，纷纷出现延迟、卡顿、闪退等问题。
As a result of the excessive number of instantaneous visits, nailing, corporate micro-letter, flying books and other online office platform overstretched, there are delays, Carton, flyback and other issues.
远程办公在中国的普及率并不高，而此次疫情成了催化剂。
Telecommuting is not widespread in China, and the epidemic has served as a catalyst.
在过去一个月中，数以亿计的中国人，被动地参加了一场远程办公的大规模社会实验。
Over the past month, hundreds of millions of Chinese have passively participated in a massive social experiment in telecommuting.
这场实验没有经过严格策划，仓促上阵，规模空前并且充满挑战。
The experiment was not carefully planned, rushed into action, unprecedented in scale and challenging.
身处其中的实验者们，包括公司管理者、员工和大量在线办公产品提供商，都有些水土不服，一边适应和磨合，一边反思：疫情终将过去，当工作回归正轨，远程办公能走多远？一场毫无准备的战役黄晓萱是一家大数据分析公司总经办负责人，公司有20多名员工，全公司居家办公，这是头一次。
For the first time, Huang Xiaoxuan, the head of a large data-analysis firm with more than 20 employees, has adapted and worn out, reflecting on how far telecommuting can go when the epidemic finally comes to an end.
开工之前，她测试了五六个线上协同办公软件，选定了钉钉和腾讯会议，并要求所有同事将软件下载安装好。
Before starting work, she tested five or six online office applications, selected nail tacks and Tencent conferences, and asked all colleagues to download and install the software.
为了监督大家早起，公司要求每天早上9点开视频会议，穿戴整齐，“穿睡衣要罚款”。
To keep you up early, the company requires a videoconference every morning at 9: 00 a.m., dressed neatly and "fined in pajamas."
尽管提前做了准备，第一天“云上班”，还是无法掩饰大家对远程办公的陌生与慌乱。
Despite the advance preparations, the first day of "cloud to work", but also can not hide the strange and confused about teleworking.
黄晓萱不敢关掉钉钉的提醒，一有消息立马点开，生怕错过任何信息，“远程办公时，每个人都会想，如果消息回复不及时，老板会担心你不在电脑前工作，这是一种心理的影响。
Huang Xiaoxuan did not dare to close the nail reminder, as soon as there was news, for fear of missing any information, "telecommuting, everyone will think, if the message is not timely, the boss will worry that you do not work in front of the computer, which is a psychological impact.
”高频次地阅读即时信息，黄晓萱的工作节奏被不停打断。
"High-frequency second reading instant messaging, Huang Xiaoxuan's work rhythm was interrupted.
在公司上班时，这种情况很少发生，手上的工作做不完，她一般不会去看消息，同事有急事，会直接到工位上找她。
This rarely happens when the company is at work. She doesn't usually go to the job, she doesn't usually go to the news, and her co-workers go to the work station to find her.
一些从大城市回到老家的人，会发现远程办公的麻烦更多。
Some people who return home from big cities will find telecommuting even more troublesome.
在武汉联想集团工作的王韬春节回到了农村老家，武汉封城后，身处各地的团队成员每天都用Skype开视频会议，但是村里网络不好，信号不稳定，成了他最头疼的事情。
When Wang Tao, who worked for Wuhan Lenovo Group, returned to his hometown of the countryside during the Spring Festival, team members from all over the city used Skype every day to hold videoconferences, but the village network was bad and the signals were unstable, making it his biggest headache.
胡世昌是湖南一家广告公司的策划总监，几周体验下来，他发现，在线上语音或者视频沟通，很依赖网络质量。
After weeks of experimenting with Hu Shichang, director of planning for an advertising company in Hunan, he has found that online voice or video communication relies heavily on network quality.
有时候突然卡顿，他还得再重复说一遍刚才的话。
Sometimes, all of a sudden, Carton had to repeat what he had said.
电话里，还经常传来同事训斥孩子的声音：“不要吵了，你安静点！”会议节奏时刻被打乱，“本来10分钟可以结束的，经常拖到了20分钟。
On the phone, the voice of a colleague scolding the child was often heard: "Stop arguing, be quiet!" The rhythm of the meeting was interrupted.
”相比中小企业，“互联网大厂”的业务数字化程度和数字化生存能力要强很多，转向“云办公”不是难事，但挑战在于：一个企业几万人，一个部门数千人，如何协同？牛刚是京东客户体验与服务部客服二中心负责人，京东1万多名客服中，有3000多人在二中心所在的成都办公，负责自营的电脑、手机、3C等品类。
Compared with small and medium-sized enterprises, the "big internet factory" has a much better degree of digitization and digital viability than small and medium-sized enterprises, and it is not difficult to switch to "cloud office," but the challenge is how to coordinate with tens of thousands of people in one department.
客服是人员密集程度最高的部门之一，疫情暴发后，他听说不少企业的客服都已停工，但京东要求客服工作一天都不能间断。
Customer service is one of the most densely populated sectors. After the outbreak, he heard that customer service had been shut down in many enterprises, but Jingdong demanded that customer service work not be interrupted for a single day.
牛刚面对的一个极大挑战是：上千人一起工作如何避免感染？无法回公司的员工，又该如何工作？牛刚告诉《中国新闻周刊》，成都客服中心很快成立应急小组，设置了职场防疫的操作标准。
One of the biggest challenges facing Niu is: How can thousands of people work together to avoid infection? How can they work if they can't go back to work? Niu just told China News Weekly that the Chengdu Customer Service Center soon set up an emergency response team and set standards for handling epidemic prevention in the workplace.
公司每天会定期消毒，所有员工进公司必须测量体温，工位之间得空出一个位置保持安全距离。
The company will disinfect regularly every day, all employees must be taken temperature into the company, the workstation must have a space between the safe distance.
为了降低感染风险，兼顾无法回公司的员工，京东迅速推出了客服中心的云平台，将办公系统搬到云上，客服只需要一台可以上网的电脑就能工作。
To reduce the risk of infection and cater for employees who cannot return to the company, Jingdong quickly rolled out a cloud platform at the Customer Service Center, moving office systems to the clouds and requiring only a computer with Internet access to work.
一周内，成都客服中心超过1500名客服开启了远程办公的模式。
Within a week, more than 1,500 customers at the Chengdu Customer Service Center opened the telecommuting model.
但一些传统线下企业，无法照搬这些模式。
But some traditional offline companies cannot replicate these models.
企业微信高级产品总监何竞对《中国新闻周刊》介绍，受到疫情冲击非常大的线下零售和服务业，如餐饮、商超等企业，也开始使用企业微信进行自救。
Underground retailing and services, such as restaurants and supermarkets, which have been hit hard by the epidemic, are also using corporate microletters to help themselves, He Jingying, senior product director for Microletters, told China News Weekly.
比如，线下无法开展服务，但希望在线上留住客源。
For example, services cannot be performed offline, but customers are expected to remain online.
1月20日，薛松哲所在连锁健身俱乐部黄金时代全体春节放假。
January 20, Xue Songzhe chain fitness club in the golden age of the Spring Festival holiday.
起初管理层比较乐观，预计在2月初，疫情就会得到基本控制。
Management was optimistic at first, and the outbreak is expected to be largely contained by early February.
但随着疫情逐渐严重，公司中高层开会，把开业时间推到正月十五以后。
But as the epidemic gradually became more serious, the company's middle and high-level meetings, the opening time was pushed forward beyond January 15.
又过了几天，他们判断，到3月份能开业就不错了。
After a few more days, they decided that it would be nice to be in business by March.
黄金时代健身在全国有54家门店，2000多名员工，作为线下服务型行业，需要顾客到店消费，是此次受疫情冲击最严重的行业之一。
Golden Age fitness in the country has 54 stores, more than 2,000 employees, as an offline service industry, customers to shop for consumption, is one of the hardest hit by the epidemic.
黄金时代健身董事长高炎在接受媒体采访时提道，“如果在完全没有收入的情况下，最多能撑50天。
"If you have no income at all, you can stay up to 50 days at most," Gao Yan, chairman of Golden Age fitness, told the media.
”但是开业风险大，黄金时代不得已转变了办公方式。
But the risks of doing business are so high that the golden age has had to shift to office work.
针对内部员工，他们使用企业微信，要求员工在线上汇报健康情况，进行线上学习和培训。
For in-house employees, they use corporate messaging, require employees to report their health online, and conduct online learning and training.
同时，他们利用企业微信、抖音推出直播，对高端会员进行一对一提醒、直播、训练视频交流，半个多月吸引了3000名新用户。
At the same time, they used micromail and chatter to launch live broadcasts, one-on-one reminders, live broadcasts, and training video exchanges for high-end members, attracting 3,000 new users for more than half a month.
尽管如此，高炎估算，线上办公对员工的管理，能够做到以前的50％，而对会员的服务，只能做到大概30％。
Despite this, high-impact estimates that online office management of staff, able to achieve the previous 50 per cent, and members of the service, can only achieve about 30 per cent.
“情况太过突然，对我们这个行业是毫无准备的一场战役。
"It was too sudden a campaign to prepare our industry.
”薛松哲感叹。
"sighed Xue.
2月11日，位于广州南沙区锦珠广场的中科智城（广州）信息科技有限公司内，空无一人的办工位上几台电脑正在运行，显示器上的代码不时滚动。
On Feb. 11, a few computers were running on an empty desk at ZhongSTe (Guangzhou) Information Technology Co. Ltd., located in Jinzhu Square, Nansha District, Guangzhou. The code on the monitor scrolls from time to time.
该企业的技术研发人员正远在家中，通过网络连接远程操作公司电脑，实现在线办公。
The company's technology developers are far away from home, through the network connection remote operation of the company's computer, the realization of online office.
图为该公司研发部副总监吴鸿与同事在线沟通。
Photo shows Hong Wu, deputy director of research and development at the company, communicating online with colleagues.
摄影/本刊记者 姬东老板最担心的问题远程办公能保证工作效率吗？疫情之前，很多人都不相信这一点。
Photo / print journalist Ji Dong's biggest concern is whether telecommuting can guarantee productivity? Before the outbreak, many people didn't believe it.
胡世昌告诉《中国新闻周刊》，远程办公最大的便利，是省去了通勤时间。
The biggest convenience of telecommuting, Hu told China News Weekly, was to save commuting time.
以往去公司上班，每天通勤时间是80分钟，再加上早起洗漱，他要提前2个小时起床。
He used to go to work and commute for 80 minutes a day. He had to get up 2 hours early to get up.
但他发现，居家办公后，自己起床晚了，但工作时间却更长了。
But he found he got up late after working from home, but worked longer hours.
“大家从11点开始工作，有时候到晚上12点，同事还在沟通，大家都默认这时候你还没休息。
"Everyone starts work at 11 o'clock, and sometimes by 12 o'clock in the evening your co-workers are still communicating and everyone agrees that you haven't taken a break by this time.
算下来，一天至少工作了9个小时，甚至是11个小时。
That translates to at least nine hours or even 11 hours of work a day.
”他说，很多客户也没有了周末的概念，经常找来谈事，原来的“995”工作模式变成了“007”。
Many clients no longer have a weekend concept, he says, referring to '995', which became '007'.
黄晓萱告诉《中国新闻周刊》，公司老板最担心的是效率问题：员工居家工作，有没有在认真干活？会不会睡懒觉？进度能不能跟上实际需求？黄晓萱的任务是尽可能解决老板的担忧，提高线上办公效率，并且每周交付一次远程办公迭代细则。
Huang told China News Weekly that the boss was most worried about efficiency: employees work from home, are they working hard? Will they sleep in? Will progress keep pace? Huang's job is to address boss concerns as much as possible, improve office efficiency online and deliver iteration rules once a week.
“云办公”第一天后，她找同事、朋友沟通，发现大家普遍觉得工作效率低。
"Cloud Office" the first day, she found that colleagues, friends to communicate, found that people generally feel inefficient.
她意识到，“所有一切关于远程办公效率的思考，都是基于现场办公形式的思考。
"All the thinking about telecommuting efficiency is based on the idea of a live office," she realized.
”传统的办公环境是大家面对面工作，早上9点打卡，下午6点下班，随时随地沟通。
The traditional office environment is where people work face-to-face, punch cards at 9 a.m. and leave work at 6 p.m. Communicate anytime, anywhere.
老板更愿意用肉眼、现场办公来验证员工是否工作满8小时。
Bosses prefer to use the naked eye, field office to verify that employees work 8 hours or less.
但是远程办公后，员工“藏”在了电脑另一端，管理者没有办法验证他确实工作了8小时，或者早已相信，这个人肯定不会工作8小时。
But after telecommuting, employees "hid" at the other end of the computer, and managers had no way to verify that he had actually worked eight hours, or had long since believed that he would not work eight hours.
“老板们通常假定，现场办公8小时，大家都在认真工作。
"Bosses normally assume that there are eight hours in the office and everyone is working really hard.
但实际上，现场8小时，并不代表真正工作8小时。
In practice, however, eight hours on site does not mean eight hours of actual work.
在家虽然没有办法进行监控，但并不代表工作效率低于现场办公的效率。
Although there is no way to monitor at home, but does not mean that work efficiency is lower than the efficiency of the field.
”黄晓萱对《中国新闻周刊》说。
Huang told China News Weekly.
很快，黄晓萱调整了远程办公细则：公司不要求员工在几分钟内必须回复信息，而是以项目管理方式对远程办公进行评估，项目保证在deadline（最后期限）之前完成，不用去考虑工作效率这个伪命题。
Soon, Ms. Huang adjusted the telecommuting rule: instead of requiring employees to reply within minutes, the company evaluated telecommuting in a project-management way, guaranteeing that the project would be completed by the deadline, regardless of the fake productivity issue.
部门的反馈佐证了黄晓萱的想法。
The feedback from the department supports Huang Xiaoxuan's idea.
复工一周后，总经办和各部门经理一对一交流，出乎意料的是，各部门都表示，远程办公不影响部门内部的效率，甚至因为能保证相对完整的思考和工作时间，效率高于现场办公。
A week after returning to work, the head office interacted with department managers on a one-on-one basis and, surprisingly, departments indicated that telecommuting did not affect efficiency within the department, even because it ensured relatively complete thinking and working hours and was more efficient than on-site work.
“信任是最为重要的。
"Trust is the most important thing.
”腾讯研究院高级研究员徐思彦告诉《中国新闻周刊》，管理者需要相信员工在家中也能完成和在办公室一样，甚至更好的工作。
Tencent Research Senior Researcher Xu Siyan told China News Weekly that managers need to believe that employees can do their jobs at home as well as in the office, or even better.
为了支撑这种信任，相对应的绩效方式也随之变化，应从“以付出时间为主转向以结果导向为主”。
In order to support this trust, the corresponding performance pattern also changes and should be changed from "pay-time-oriented to results-oriented."
“从管理哲学上来讲，是倾向于传统的监管思维向倾向于让员工自我驱动的管理思维的转变。
"In terms of management philosophy, there is a shift away from traditional regulatory thinking towards self-driven management thinking.
”腾讯研究院的研究总结。
A summary of Tencent's research.
这意味着，远程办公既考验着团队领导的管理能力，也对员工素质提出了更高的要求。
This means that telecommuting not only tests the management ability of the team leader, but also puts forward higher requirements for the quality of the staff.
体验了将近三周的远程办公，胡世昌发现，自己的工作效率并没有受到太大影响。
After nearly three weeks of telecommuting, Mr. Hu has found his productivity hasn't been much affected.
每一次开会，团队都会提前确定一个非常明确的主题和任务，并在小群里讨论。
At each meeting, the team identifies a very specific topic and task in advance and discusses them in small groups.
每一个项目都要写一个简报，相较于过去，简报内容十分精确，把具体的时间、事件和负责人做成表格，发在群里，大家按照任务时间点来完成，“团队领导与员工的沟通能力，也决定了远程办公的效果。
For each project, a brief is written, which is more precise than in the past. The specific time, event and person in charge are tabulated and posted in the group. The team leader's ability to communicate with the staff also determines the effectiveness of telecommuting
”腾讯研究院的一份研究报告如此总结：“管理流程是非常重要的环节，流程化能够让团队成员都按规则办事，让工作周期变得清晰可控。
A research report by Tencent Research concludes: "The management process is a very important part of the process, and any process can allow team members to play by the rules and make the cycle clear and manageable.
”黄晓萱也在用这种方法，试图解决公司跨部门合作的问题。
Ms Huang is also using this approach to try to solve the problem of cross-sectoral co-operation.
复工第一周后，公司各部门普遍跟她反映，跨部门协调性比较低。
The first week after the resumption of work, the company departments generally reflect with her, cross-sectoral coordination is relatively low.
但在她看来，这也是一个伪命题，造成效率低的原因是，跨部门协作时很多地方是模糊的。
But, in her view, it was also a pseudo-proposition, and the reason for the inefficiency was that much of the cross-sectoral collaboration was vague.
现场办公时，遇到模糊不清的目标或者流程，大家可以随时召集会议讨论，但是远程办公及时性较差。
On-site work, encountered ambiguous objectives or processes, we can call meetings to discuss, but the timeliness of telecommuting is poor.
“但根本原因不是远程协作的问题，而是流程或者需求不明确。
"But the root cause is not remote collaboration, but unclear processes or requirements.
”黄晓萱对《中国新闻周刊》说。
Huang told China News Weekly.
2月10日，在深圳平安金融中心，企业员工在楼下使用笔记本电脑连接公司内网下载安装远程办公软件，以便实现居家“云办公”。
In Shenzhen's Ping An Financial Center on Feb. 10, employees used laptops downstairs to connect to the company's intranet and install telecommuting software to make it a home office.
图/新华“人山会海”的挑战疫情之下突然而至的大考，没有做好准备的不仅是数亿管理者和员工，还包括很多在线办公产品的提供商。
2007-9-24 16: 38 [hide] The sudden arrival of hundreds of millions of managers and employees, as well as many providers of online office products, is not only unprepared for the big test.
1月23日，何竞所在的企业微信产品团队收到了医疗行业发来的需求，疫情严重，医院要在线上开会，患者要线上问诊。
On January 23, HE's corporate micro-credit product team received a demand from the medical industry, the outbreak is serious, hospitals to meet online, patients to consult online.
最初，何竞只是希望尽快解决医院的需求，完全没有意识到，线上办公需求将会成为下一个爆点。
Initially, he simply wanted to solve the hospital's needs as soon as possible, completely unaware that the online office needs will be the next explosion.
国家要求延迟复工后，1月28日开始，越来越多的客户开始询问线上办公的功能。
Starting January 28, more and more customers began asking about the function of online office after the state demanded a delay in resuming work.
何竞介绍，当时团队300多人几乎全员加班，高负荷运转来满足开发周期的需要。
Atletico said the team of more than 300 people almost full overtime, high-capacity operation to meet the development cycle.
客户端的发布周期也缩短，基本上两天更新一个功能。
The release cycle of the client is also shortened, with basically one feature updated in two days.
2月1日，企业微信发布新版本，为学校、医院和企业提供6个新能力，包括在微信群里远程教学、帮助企业收集员工的健康状况、支持300人同时音视频会议、在线问诊等。
On 1 February, a new edition of Enterprise Micromail was launched, providing six new competencies for schools, hospitals and businesses, including distance learning in micro-clusters, helping businesses collect employee health, supporting 300 simultaneous audio-visual conferences, online consultations, etc.
但复工第一天的大爆发，还是让产品差点瘫掉。
But the first day of resumption of work, or the outbreak of products almost collapsed.
2月3日是很多公司云复工的第一天，却纷纷遭遇钉钉、企业微信等办公软件集体崩溃，出现严重延迟、卡顿或者闪退的问题。
On February 3, the first day many companies went back to work, they were confronted with the collective collapse of office software, such as nailing, micromail and other office software, with serious delays, problems with Catton or evasion.
“瞬间同时发起海量各类会议直播，网络暂时出现限流。
"Instantly and simultaneously launched a large number of live meetings, the network temporarily limited flow.
”钉钉的数据显示，当天全国有超过1000万企业、近2亿人在钉钉上开启在家办公模式。
According to the nail figures, more than 10 million businesses and nearly 200 million people across the country were working from home on nails.
企业微信则向《中国新闻周刊》介绍，当天同时发起会议的数量达到了几十万场。
The number of simultaneous launches reached hundreds of thousands, the company told China News Weekly.
复工之前，何竞看到用户预约的数量时，已经预料到会出现服务器的问题，团队提前做了预案。
Before going back to work, when he saw the number of user appointments, he had anticipated server problems, and the team had planned ahead of time.
但到了2月3日，在线使用软件的企业数量是去年的3倍，同时发起会议的数量达到几十万场，这远远超出了他们的想象。
But by February 3, the number of businesses using the software online was three times that of last year, and the number of sponsorship meetings reached hundreds of thousands, far beyond their wildest dreams.
各公司技术团队紧急扩容。
The technical team of each company expands urgently.
钉钉在短短2小时内新增部署了超过1万台云服务器，这个数字也创下了阿里云上快速扩容的新纪录，短时间内恢复了功能。
More than 10,000 new cloud servers were deployed in just two hours, a number that also set a new record for a rapid expansion on Ali's cloud and quickly returned to action.
但不可否认的是，“水土不服”的不仅是用户，提供远程办公产品的公司们，面对海量的用户数，也显得有些慌乱。
But it is undeniable that "water and soil not only users, the company that provides telecommuting products, facing a huge number of users, also appeared a bit confused.
徐思彦对《中国新闻周刊》介绍，远程办公主要的问题之一，源自于信息流的不同步。
Xu told China News Weekly that one of the main problems with telecommuting stems from the lack of synchronization of information flows.
作为解决方案和产品，协作工具可以让天各一方的团队及时知道要干什么，彼此在干什么以及完成得如何，从功能拆解下来就包括即时通讯、文档协作、会务系统、任务管理等部分，构成一个完整的“远程办公系统”。
As a solution and product, the collaboration tool lets each team know what to do, what they are doing and how well they are doing. Disassembly from functionality includes instant messaging, document collaboration, conference systems, and task management, and forms a complete "telecommuting system."
1月24日起，企业级综合协作工具企业微信、飞书、钉钉，专业的音视频会议提供方Zoom、小鱼易连、华为云WeLink、腾讯会议，文档协作公工具石墨、印象笔记、ONES等纷纷免费开放远程办公产品，加入了“抗疫”大战。
Since January 24, enterprise-level integrated collaboration tools such as Micromail, Flying Books, Nailing, professional audio and video conference providers Zoom, Yi-lian, Huawei WeLink, Tencent Conference, document collaboration tools Graphite, Impression Notes, ONES and other free open telecommuting products, joined the battle against the epidemic.
大年初五，字节跳动旗下的飞书团队也收到了企业的办公需求，临时召集团队工作紧急加班。
At the beginning of the year, the byte-beating team also received the company's office needs, temporary team work emergency overtime.
“我们当时想的就是如何真实再现大家在一起办公的感觉，而又不希望，在家办公变成在家开一天的会。
"What we were thinking about was how to really recreate the feeling of people working together and not want to work from home to have a one-day meeting at home.
” 飞书团队告诉《中国新闻周刊》，整个项目推进得非常快，新功能用了5天时间远程上线。
The flying book team told China News Weekly that the project was progressing very fast and that the new feature had taken five days to go online remotely.
疫情让远程办公变得更加迫切，也在倒逼远程办公产品的完善。
The epidemic is making telecommuting even more urgent and pushing back the perfection of teleworking products.
飞书团队表示，当下考验的是，办公协作产品是否足够易用，服务是否足够稳定，能够真正解决用户需求。
The fly-by-book team says the test now is whether the office collaboration product is easy enough to use, and whether the service is stable enough to truly address user needs.
视频会议需求是此次爆发最快的一个领域，成为了众多公司的主要需求，也或将成为未来各公司集中火力竞争的焦点。
Demand for videoconferencing is one of the fastest-growing areas of the explosion, becoming a major demand for many companies and perhaps the focus of intense competition among companies in the future.
直到去年年底，小鱼易连联合创始人兼CEO袁文辉都难以想象，主要做To B业务的公司会在2020年迎来快速增长的机会。
Until the end of last year, Yuan Wenhui, co-founder and CEO of Fisher-Yi, could hardly have imagined that a company focused on ToB would have a chance to grow rapidly in 2020.
小鱼易连是一家视频会议厂商。
Fish Yi Lian is a video conference manufacturer.
从大年初一开始，后台压力就不断增加。
From the beginning of the New Year, backstage pressure is increasing.
公司云视频会议方案收到了三波明显的需求信号，分别是政府疫情管控的需要，教培机构和各地教育局在线教育的需要，以及企业远程办公的需要。
Three distinct demand signals were received for the company's cloud videoconference programme, namely, the need for government disease control, the need for on-line education in educational institutions and local education bureaux, and the need for telecommuting in enterprises.
“疫情期间一天的呼叫量，相当于去年一两个月的总和。
"The number of calls a day during an epidemic is equivalent to one or two months of last year combined.
”袁文辉对《中国新闻周刊》介绍，当前在转化客户上非常快，很多客户看到产品演示，第二天就开始试用，这在以前难以想象。
Yuan Wenhui told China News Weekly that the transformation of customers is now very fast, with many customers seeing product demonstrations and starting trials the next day, which was previously unthinkable.
1月26日，小鱼易连推出了免费的100方会议。
On January 26, fish Yi Lianlian launched a free 100-party conference.
但作为初创公司，小鱼易连难以负担云视频会议背后高额的流量费。
But as a start-up, Fisher can't afford the high traffic costs behind cloud-conferencing.
袁文辉介绍，他与客户的合作有两种形式，让高质量的客户掏腰包，或者一起找运营商合作。
Mr. Yuan said he worked with customers in two ways, with high-quality customers out of pocket, or together with operators.
腾讯、阿里、华为等巨头也在加速涌入市场，推出全免费的服务。
Tencent, Ali, Huawei and other giants are also accelerating into the market, the introduction of all-free services.
“现在是云视频会议发展的一个拐点。
"This is an inflection point for cloud video conferencing development.
”袁文辉比较乐观，不认为巨头入场会抢占垂直小公司的市场，反而会对公司长远发展有利，“就像当初滴滴打车一样，巨头补贴过后，用户养成使用习惯，大家就会有更高的要求。
Yuan is more optimistic that the giant's admission will capture the market for small vertical companies, but will be good for the company's long-term development. "Just like every taxi ride, after the giant's subsidies, users develop the habit of using it, and people will demand more."

”国盛证券近日发布的报告提到，2019年全球会议室数量达到9200万个，但视频会议系统的渗透率也只有4.2％，“大部分的用户尚未形成协作办公的使用习惯，巨头入场的第一个影响就是有利于带动用户习惯的形成，做大整个市场规模”。
A recent report by Sheng Securities noted that while the number of conference rooms worldwide reached 92 million in 2019, the penetration rate for videoconferencing systems was only 4.2 per cent.

Atletico Ho, senior product director for Microcredit, said micromail was an integrated office product compared to Zoom, not just a vertical online video category, and it was impossible to put all research and development manpower into a single point.
“疫情暴发没有给产品太多的准备，就被推向了市场。
"The outbreak was pushed into the market without too much preparation for the outbreak.

Atletico said more time was needed to polish client or technical details, or more users were needed to uncover the problem.
大规模实验之后远程办公在中国的发展滞后于一些发达国家。
The development of telecommuting in China lags behind that of some developed countries.
Global Workplace Analytics的数据显示，2005年中国有180万人远程办公，到了2014年也仅有360万，按照复合增长率为8％进行推断，2019年远程办公人数也大约只有530万人。
According to Global Workplace Analytics, 1.8 million people were telecommuting in China in 2005 and 3.6 million in 2014, and only 5.3 million people were telecommuting in 2019, based on a compound growth rate of 8 per cent.
以中国14亿人口基数来观察，占比非常小。
Viewed from China's population base of 1.4 billion, it accounts for a very small percentage.
美国在远程办公领域一马当先。
The United States leads the way in telecommuting.
数据显示，截至2017年，美国超过八成企业引入了远程办公制度，已有3000万人在家中远程办公，占美国工作人口的16％~19％。

钉钉副总裁白惠源注意到，在国外，远程办公和数字化办公早已成为企业的常规工作方式，但中国还在起步阶段，“很多企业组织还有很大的惯性，数字化工作方式没有培养起来，对远程办公的认识还停留在OA、邮箱、移动审批等层面。
While telecommuting and digitalization have long been the norm in foreign countries, Mr Bai notes, China is still in its infancy: "There is still a lot of inertia in many organisations, digital ways of working have not been developed and the perception of telecommuting is still on the OA, mailbox and mobile approval levels."
”多位在线办公服务提供商告诉《中国新闻周刊》，中国跟国外的差距，主要不在于技术，而在于观念。
Several online office service providers told China News Weekly that the gap between China and foreign countries is not so much about technology as about perceptions.
此前，袁文辉要说服客户购买云视频会议很不容易，“打个比方，假如一个人从小到大从没吃过猪肉，我要把猪肉卖给他，很难。
Yuan had difficulty persuading customers to buy cloud-conferencing. "For example, if a person has never eaten pork since childhood, it would be difficult for me to sell him pork.
但是最近只能吃猪肉，你吃完后觉得挺香，这时候我再卖给你，就太容易了。
But only recently can eat pork, you eat after feeling pretty fragrant, this time I sell you again, it is too easy.
”除了观念上的排斥和不习惯，徐思彦认为，远程办公在国内迟迟未能爆发，一方面是因为很多企业工作环境数字化程度不足，即便是天然数字化属性高的互联网企业中，很多工作也难以实现数字化，更不用说大量的线下中小实体企业。
Apart from conceptual ostracism and unaccustomed attitudes, Mr Tsui argues that telecommuting has been slow to break out in China partly because many companies work in environments that are not sufficiently digitalized to allow many jobs to be digitized, let alone a large number of small and medium-sized online entities.
另一方面，则是管理制度的问题，企业需要从顶层设计，为远程办公量身打造相应的管理机制。
On the other hand, it is a problem of management system, enterprises need to design from the top layer, to build a corresponding management mechanism for telecommuting.

He had the impression that attending an industry summit at the end of last year was also widely seen as spending too much on digitization, which was a bit redundant.
而这次黑天鹅事件让邓智的团队开始反思，“这段时间我们发现线上办公反而让沟通更加高效，我们在想哪些东西是在疫情过后可以固化下来，包括管理流程、项目制跨部门的合作方式。
The Black Swan incident led Deng's team to rethink. "We found that working online makes communication more efficient, and we're thinking about what can be fixed after an epidemic, including management processes, how projects work across sectors."
