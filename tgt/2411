澎湃新闻记者 于潇清近日，韩国和日本新冠肺炎疫情防控形势日趋严峻，引起国际社会关注。
Recently, the situation of prevention and control of Pneumonia in Korea and Japan became more and more serious, attracting the attention of the international community.
据韩国中央防疫对策本部2月28日最新通报，截至当天上午9点，韩国再新增新冠肺炎确诊病例256例，累计2022例，死亡病例达13例。
As of 9: 00 am, 256 new cases of pneumonia had been confirmed in South Korea, with a total of 2,022 cases and 13 deaths, the ministry said.
27日，韩国的疫情中心大邱市迎来疫情暴发以来单日增长最急剧的一天。
South Korea's Daegu, the epicentre of the epidemic, saw its sharpest day of growth since the outbreak began yesterday.
当天，韩国全国新增病例505例，大邱占超过八成。
South Korea that day, 505 new cases, Daegu accounted for more than 80%.
目前，韩国超过六成的病例集中在大邱。
More than 60% of cases in South Korea are concentrated in Daegu.
而大邱的医疗资源已经连续多日处于超负荷状态。
Daegu's medical resources have been overstretched for days on end.
27日，由于病房不足，一名74岁男性新冠病毒确诊患者在家中自我隔离时病情恶化，送医院急救后不治身亡。
A 74-year-old man who was diagnosed with the new crown virus died after being taken to hospital after suffering a deterioration in self-isolation at home due to a shortage of wards.
这使人们担心由于床位不足可能导致更多病例死亡的发生。
This has led to fears that the shortage of beds could lead to more deaths.
同样是在27日，由于韩美两军中都出现了新冠肺炎患者，韩国联合参谋本部和韩美联军司令部表示，受新冠肺炎疫情影响，韩美决定推迟原定于3月初举行的联合军演。
Also on the 27th, South Korea's Joint Staff Headquarters and South Korea-US Combined Forces Command said they had postponed a joint military exercise originally planned for early March because of the outbreak of pneumonia in both Koreas and the United States.
韩美因传染病疫情推迟联合军演日程尚属首次。
South Korea and the United States because of infectious diseases delayed the joint military training schedule is the first.
截至本文发稿，日本尚未报告新增的新冠病毒感染者，但据27日统计，包括游轮“钻石公主”号邮轮上的确认病例在内，日本国内累计确诊新冠肺炎病例919例，因新冠肺炎死亡累计8人。
A total of 919 new cases of pneumonia and eight deaths from Newcrown Pneumonia have been confirmed in Japan, including those confirmed on board the cruise ship Princess Diamond, the newspaper reported Wednesday.
28日，由于疫情扩大，日本东京的迪士尼乐园和大阪的环球影城相继宣布自2月29日至3月15日休园。
Disneyland in Tokyo and Universal Studios in Osaka were closed from February 29 to March 15 as the epidemic spread.
同日，日本文部科学省2月28日向全国各都道府县教育委员会等发出通知，要求所有中小学学校停课。
On the same day, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology of Japan issued a circular on 28 February to prefectural education committees, among others, requiring all primary and secondary schools to suspend classes.
日本首相安倍晋三在众议院表示，“现在正是控制疫情扩大速度的极为重要时期”，因此希望社会理解停课的要求。
Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe, told the House: "This is a very important time to control the spread of the epidemic," and he wants society to understand the requirements.
但日本媒体报道称，安倍政府突如其来的决定不仅使日本民众不安感增加，更使得学校和家长措手不及。
But Japanese media reported that Abe's sudden decision had not only increased anxiety among the Japanese public, but had taken schools and parents by surprise.
文部省的通知也让有权实施停课的各地教委面临艰难决策，地方政府担忧停课可能引发更大混乱。
The Education Ministry's announcement has also exposed local education commissions, which have the power to suspend classes, to difficult decisions, and local authorities fear that the suspension could lead to greater confusion.
然而，同样严峻的疫情，映射到韩日两座城市——大邱与大阪的民众生活中却是两幅不同的光景。
However, the same severe epidemic, mapped to the two cities of South Korea and Japan - Daegu and Osaka in the people's lives of two different scenes.
在韩国大邱市庆北大学留学的博士生小杨两周来切身感受到周围人对疫情的紧张感升级，而在日本大阪大学求学的博士生小高却被导师视作”过于紧张“。
Xiao Yang, a PhD student studying at Kyung Bei University in Daegu City, South Korea, experienced a two-week rise in tension around him, while Takao, a PhD student studying at Osaka University in Japan, was seen by his tutor as "overly nervous."
日前，他们分别向澎湃新闻讲述了两座城市不同的战疫故事。
A few days ago, they told the roar news of the two cities of different epidemic stories.
大邱：我的“工作狂”教授也不来学校了我是来自韩国庆北大学的小杨，目前正在攻读文学情报专业的博士学位。
Daegu: My workaholic professor isn't coming to school either. I'm Xiao Yang from Gyeongbei University in South Korea.
2月5日我从国内回到大邱，在从仁川机场乘坐大巴前往大邱的路上，我注意到车上的乘客并没有佩戴口罩，当时还有同学邀请我到首尔一同居住，那时候感觉整个韩国都没有特别注意这场疫情。
Back in Taegu on February 5, on my way from Incheon Airport by bus to Taegu, I noticed that the passengers were not wearing masks and that I had been invited to live in Seoul by fellow students.
回到大邱之后，我收到了学校国际交流部门让我尽量居家隔离14天的要求。
Back in Daegu, I received a request from the school's international exchange department to keep me as close to home as possible for 14 days.
当时我正好在搬家，所以隔离前先去了之前的出租屋拿东西。
I was just moving, so I went to the rental house to get my stuff before segregation.
我清楚地记得当时在出租车上，司机师傅还主动提醒我关上车窗防止着凉。
I remember clearly that in the taxi, the driver also volunteered to remind me to close the window to avoid catching cold.
而当我14天的居家隔离结束之后，正值韩国尤其是大邱2月19日开始爆发疫情，20日当我再次乘坐出租车时，司机师傅则要求必须打开窗户保持通风。
And when my 14-day quarantine ended, just as South Korea, particularly Daegu, began to erupt on February 19, and when I took a taxi again on February 20, the driver asked to open the window to keep it ventilated.
现在，学校已经通知延期到三月中旬开学，大邱所有的公共图书馆、博物馆、教堂也都已关闭。
Schools have now been told to postpone the opening of the school until mid-March, and all public libraries, museums and churches in Daegu have been closed.
疫情爆发之后，我只出门两次，都是去自己学校的研究室。
After the outbreak, I went out only twice, to my school's research office.
虽然每次去我都会提前发邮件给我的同学和老师，请他们不要因为我的到来而困扰，但我总能感觉大家都会刻意保持一定的距离。
Although I would email my classmates and teachers in advance to ask them not to be bothered by my arrival, I always felt that everyone would keep a certain distance.
同学告诉我，我那位“工作狂”一般、几乎每天都要来学校的教授，现在已经不来学校了。
My classmates told me that my workaholic professor, who came to school almost every day, no longer came to school.
现在，大邱街上几乎每个人都带着口罩，但是还能感觉出人们是在正常工作和上班的，我注意到饭店门口都张贴着消毒告示，里面也没有什么顾客，但有朋友告诉我，晚上营业的酒馆似乎生意还不错，是不是大家都认为酒精可以消毒呢？坦白说，我没有看到特别多针对性的防控措施。
Today, almost everyone on Daegu Street wears a mask, but I can sense that people are working and going to work. I notice pasteurization signs in front of the hotel door, and there are no customers, but a friend told me that the pubs open at night seem to be doing well and everyone thinks alcohol can be sterilized.
就我所知，韩国国民都会定时收到短信，提示疫情相关的信息，同时各个住宿区附近也会有一些大喇叭广播，提醒大家要戴口罩，注意通风和卫生等。
As far as I know, South Korean nationals receive regular text messages to alert them about the epidemic, and there are loudspeakers around the various residential areas to warn people to wear masks, ventilation and hygiene.
此外，政府将有计划地提供口罩，现在口罩成为了紧俏商品，大家排着很长的队伍购买口罩，我还看到有韩国朋友囤了一堆口罩拍照“炫富” 。
In addition, the government will systematically supply face masks, which are now a hot commodity, with long queues for masks, and I've seen a South Korean friend take pictures of a stack of masks to "dazzle the rich."
网络平台的一些货物已经售罄 本文图片均为受访者供图大邱的“超级传播事件”出现之后，这几天网购的人明显增多，派送员们想来也更忙碌了。
Some of the goods on the web platform have already sold out. This picture shows a marked increase in online purchases over the past few days following the emergence of the 'super spread incident' in which the respondents supplied Tu Daegu.
大部分的隔天派送都是早上七点之前完成，我们任何时候打开家门就可以收货，他们通过购物平台显示派送情况，用户收货有问题也可通过网络平台解决，不需要见面。
Most of the next day delivery is done before 7: 00 a.m., we can open the door at any time to receive goods, they show the delivery through the shopping platform, users can receive problems can be solved through the network platform, do not need to meet.
这样快捷的派送服务大受欢迎，但有些食品就很快断货了。
Such quick delivery is popular, but some of the food is quickly out of stock.
所以除新鲜食品外，干货之类的我会选择一般派送，大概耗费两到三天时间。
So in addition to fresh food, dry goods and so on I will choose the general delivery, about two to three days.
几天前，一般派送的派送员敲了我的门，我为了避免跟人接触，请他把货物放在门口。
A few days ago, a general messenger knocked on my door. To avoid contact, I asked him to leave the goods at the door.
他说需要签字确认，于是我戴好口罩打开门。
He said he needed to sign to confirm, so I put on a mask and opened the door.
他是个中年男人，瘦高个子，当天下雨，他的雨衣和头盔上都有水，虽然头盔上有挡风玻璃，但能看出他的头发和衣领似乎都是湿的，嘴唇干得似乎要掉皮裂开了，显然已经工作很久，一脸疲惫。
He was a middle-aged man, tall and thin. It rained that day, his raincoat and helmet were covered with water, and although his helmet had windshields, his hair and collar seemed wet, his lips seemed dry and cracked, he was obviously working long and tired.
我签了字谢过他，他只说了声再见就快速离开了。
I signed and thanked him, and he left quickly, saying good-bye.
在大邱，人们已经普遍选择不出门而是通过快递购置货物现在，中国留学生回到韩国后都要接受14天的居家隔离观察，大家普遍很配合。
In Daegu, people have generally chosen not to go out but to buy goods by express delivery. Now, Chinese students return to South Korea to undergo a 14-day stay-at-home quarantine.
大邱疫情爆发后，许多留学生开始考虑回国，但我还会继续坚持一段时间这样的居家学习生活的状态。
After the outbreak of Daegu, many foreign students began to consider returning home, but I will continue to stay at home and study for a while.
大阪：我担心疫情，日本朋友说我“多虑了”我是来自日本大阪大学的小高，目前是一位灾难重建专业的在读博士，我所在的城市大阪最近刚刚出现新冠肺炎确诊病例，身边的日本朋友都开始说担心疫情发展，但是我的直观感受是，看不到大家尤其是年轻人的实际行动，可以说除了戴口罩之外，大家的生活仍然非常正常。
Osaka: I'm worried about the outbreak. Japanese friends say I'm "worried." I am a doctor from Osaka University in Japan. I am a doctor specializing in disaster reconstruction. My Japanese friends are worried about the outbreak.
就在26日，东京都内的一些大型活动比如演唱会开始停止了，之前我身边的日本年轻人们还在计划着如何去东京观看演唱会，现在他们还在说“如果不是取消了的话肯定要去的”。
On the 26th, major events in Tokyo, such as concerts, stopped, after young Japanese around me were still planning to go to Tokyo to see the concert, and now they were saying, "If not canceled, they would definitely go."
即便是在大阪，口罩也已经成为非常紧俏的商品一个非常直观的变化是，上周我出门的时候街上佩戴口罩人数的比例大概是三分之一，但现在有近八成的人都佩戴口罩，口罩和消毒水因此也成为了紧俏甚至买不到的商品。
Even in Osaka, masks have become a very popular commodity. While the number of masks on the streets was about one-third when I went out last week, nearly 80% of people now wear masks, masks, and disinfectant products.
不过年轻人戴口罩的要少一些，在我打工的食品店，店员里只有我一个人是佩戴口罩的，我的日本同事们都没有戴。
But I'm the only one in the grocery store where I work who wears masks, and none of my Japanese colleagues wear them.
在大阪，中国留学生会尽量减少出门，但我的日本朋友给我的感觉是非常“淡定”，他们会正常逛街购物。
In Osaka, Chinese students will try to avoid going out as much as possible, but my Japanese friends give me the feeling that they will go shopping normally.
他们说也在关注这个疫情，但新冠肺炎在中国的死亡率并不是很高，病故的患者不少都是有基础疾病且年纪较大。
They say they are also concerned about the outbreak, but the death rate in China is not very high, and many of the deaths are due to basic illnesses and old age.
我对他们说，不希望日本的疫情也越来越严重，他们说我“过虑了”。
I told them I didn't want the epidemic to get worse in Japan, and they said I was "taking it too seriously."
大阪的药妆店专门贴出说明称店员会佩戴口罩，但请大家不要担心日本现在的一些公司开始实行“错峰上班”的模式，但我身边的朋友会利用错峰上班的时间去健身房锻炼，对于他们来说错峰似乎并不是为了防控疫情。
Osaka Makeup Shop has instructions saying employees will wear masks, but please don't worry that some companies in Japan are starting to adopt the "staggered work-out" mode, but friends around me will take advantage of the break-peak hours to work out at the gym, which doesn't seem to be for them to control the epidemic.
就我所见，大阪目前还没采取更多的防控措施，也没注意到包括公共交通设施在内的场所有为民众测量体温的措施。
As far as I can see, Osaka has not taken more control measures, nor has it noticed that there are measures in place, including public transport facilities, to measure people's body temperature.
大阪大学每两天会更新疫情速报发给每一位同学，并开展网上直播的疫情防控学习会。
Osaka University updates the outbreak alert every two days and conducts live webcasts of the disease prevention and control sessions.
学校的速报里提醒，如果有发热情况就请自行在家隔离，速报上会附有一些诊所的联系电话，让民众自行联系。
If you have a fever, be sure to isolate yourself at home, warned the school's Express. Some of the clinic's contact numbers will be attached to the speed paper for people to contact themselves.
整体的感觉是日本是将疫情的防控寄希望于企业和个人自身的决定，以至于大家也并不特别清楚要怎么做。
The general feeling is that Japan is pinning the prevention and control of the epidemic on the decisions of companies and individuals themselves, so that it is not particularly clear what to do.
日本歌手西川贵教26日还在网上抱怨自己不清楚演唱会到底是否要继续，批评政府没有给到民众明确的信息。
Japanese singer Nishikawa also complained on the Internet on the 26th that they do not know whether the concert will continue, criticized the government did not give the public clear messages.
大阪市从29日开始，高中以外的学校都要停课了，我也注意到日本首相安倍晋三宣布要求全国中小学3月2日起停课的消息，但我感觉到，针对这些决定，大家更多的是抱怨。
In Osaka City, schools outside high schools have been closed since the 29th, and I have taken note of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's announcement that schools will be closed on March 2 across the country, but I sense that there are more complaints about these decisions.
在日本的中国留学生现在挺团结的，大家都会相互调剂口罩。
Chinese students in Japan are now very united, everyone will swap masks.
我也有回国的想法，中国同学听说后帮我找到了N95口罩。
I also have the idea of returning to China, Chinese students heard that I found the N95 mask.
而当我把自己想回国的想法通过邮件告知我的导师后，他并没有直接同意，字里行间也在暗示我是过于紧张了。
When I e-mailed my tutor about my desire to return to my country, he did not agree, and the lines implied that I was too nervous.
现在，我已经查询好如果回到我的故乡江苏之后，自己应该按规定做哪些事情。
Now I have made inquiries about what I should do according to the rules if I return to my hometown of Jiangsu.
我准备今天再当面去找导师谈一次。
I'm going to meet my tutor again today.
