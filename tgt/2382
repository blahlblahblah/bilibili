燃财经（ID:rancaijing）原创作者 | 韩冰编辑 | 阿伦疫情“黑天鹅”一出，企业现金流骤降，不少线下业态面临生存考验，教育机构首当其冲。
Flaming Finance (ID: Rancaijing) Former founder and author of Han Bing & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
近日，教育培训机构“优胜教育”被曝拖欠薪资，部分员工遭遇裁员。
Recently, education and training institutions "superior education" was revealed to be in arrears, some employees suffered layoffs.
同时，有员工反馈校区要求老师转型销售全员卖课，提成日结，并通知周上课不超过20小时、月销售不足120课时者将被优化或转兼职。
At the same time, there are staff feedback school district requirements for teachers to transform sales full-time sales, commission day, and notify the week no more than 20 hours, sales less than 120 hours a month will be optimized or converted to part-time.
据员工反映，优胜教育在2019年12月就出现了资金和运营问题。
According to employees, Yum Win Education had funding and operational problems in December 2019.
有在职或离职员工只收到12月以后部分工资，也有校区出现关店传言、家长要求退费现象。
Active or separated employees only received 12 months after part of the salary, there are also campus rumors of shop, parents request refund phenomenon.
另外，有员工指出公司长期以来分两张卡发工资以避税。
In addition, some employees pointed out that the company has long been divided into two cards to avoid taxes.
对此，优胜教育回应燃财经称：“疫情期间公司在竭尽全力分批发放工资，未来会陆续补充发放；跟不上公司步伐和要求的员工会有一定的优化，疫情期间流程上可能有不规范的地方；全员销售是很多公司使用的方法，很正常。
During the epidemic, the company is making every effort to pay salaries in batches and replenish them in the future. Employees who cannot keep up with the pace and requirements of the company will be optimized and there may be irregularities in the process during the epidemic. Full-time sales are the normal method used by many companies, "Yum said.
”优胜教育是一家成立20余年的教育机构，主打K12领域个性化教育，在全国有1500多家门店，1.3万余名员工，门店有直营、加盟等形式。
Yousheng Education is an educational institution founded in more than 20 years, specializing in individualized education in the field of K12, with more than 1,500 stores across the country with more than 13,000 employees.
优胜教育创始人兼董事长陈昊在业界颇有名气，曾在求职类节目《非你莫属》中担任BOSS团嘉宾，因言辞犀利引起不少人关注。
Chen Hao, founder and chairman of Yousheng Education, is well-known in the industry. He was a guest of BOSS in the job-search program "You are the only one" and attracted a lot of attention for his sharp words.
陈昊也曾在某视频节目中提到优胜教育曾听取咨询公司的建议结果走了弯路，导致公司不合理扩张，遭遇重大损失。
Chen Hao also in a video program mentioned winning education had listened to the advice of consulting companies turned upside down, resulting in unreasonable expansion of the company, suffered heavy losses.
最惨的时候，陈昊卖了房子、抵押了车，回到家首先把阳台门堵上以防跳楼。
In the worst of times, Chen Hao sold the house, mortgaged the car, went home first to block the balcony door to prevent jump.
如今，优胜教育再次面临考验。
Today, winning education is once again being tested.
员工指优胜教育欠薪、裁员要求全员销售“1月8日，我和另一个同事在加班，经理跟我们说，你们明天不用来了，直接找财务就可以了，”优胜教育广州市二宫校区的教师廖老师告诉燃财经，“询问原因时，HR说‘你是被开除的’，原因是试用期考核不达标、不服从管理。
"On January 8, another colleague and I were working overtime and the manager told us you were not coming tomorrow, just look for finance," Liao, a teacher at the Second Palace campus in Guangzhou, told Flaming Finance.
但当时我已经过了试用期一个月了，只是还没签合同。
But I had been on probation for a month, but I hadn't signed the contract yet.
”廖老师拒绝主动申请离职，主管随即把他从校区所有的工作群里移除。
Mr Liao refused to ask for leave unsolicited and the supervisor removed him from all work groups on the campus.
工资只发了2019年12月和2020年1月底薪的30%，几百块钱。
Wages are paid at 30% of the base salary for December 2019 and January 2020, hundreds of dollars.
在燃财经加入的一个优胜维权群里，近170余名优胜员工自称有欠薪、被离职、强制转兼职岗、合同纠纷等遭遇。
In one of the winning groups, which combust finance and finance, nearly 170 winning employees reported unpaid salaries, layoffs, forced conversions to part-time jobs and contractual disputes.
。

优胜教育维权群里员工备注的欠薪信息图 / 微信群截图据廖老师介绍，她所在的校区平时总部给定的脱贫线（校区成本）是23万，总目标是46万，疫情前他们每个月营收大约在23万左右，1月份因为很多学生放寒假回老家，学员减少，营收仅10万多。
According to Liao, her school district has a given poverty line (campus cost) of 230,000 and a total target of 460,000. Before the epidemic, they had about 230,000 monthly incomes. In January, many students returned home during winter vacations and had fewer students, earning just over 100,000.
而且，她也早听说所在校区要合并到其它校区。
Moreover, she had heard that her campus would be merged with other campuses.
优胜教育通知截图／受访者供图北京九龙山校区的王玲在优胜教育工作两年多了，据她介绍，疫情之下校区开始转为线上上课，但她因为老家没电脑没网，上不了课而被辞退并踢出了工作群。
The winning education announcement screenshot / interviewee showed that Wang Ling had been working in Yue Shing Education for more than two years, but she was fired and kicked out of the work group because she did not have a computer or internet in her hometown and could not go to school.
“我在疫情期间上不了课属于不可抗力，但公司每天要求的刷题和参加线上会议我都是出勤的，我本来打算等情况稳定一点回校区拿电脑再上课，但我们部门主管在2月14日以我不上课为由让我办离职再转兼职，我不同意，2月20日校长和主管就把我移出所有群了。
"I couldn't attend class during the epidemic because it was force majeure, but I attended all the errands and meetings that the company required every day. I was going to wait until things stabilized and get my computer back on campus.
现在还欠着我1月和2月的工资共5000多元。
I still owe you more than $5,000 for January and February.
”王玲表示。
"said Wang.
因疫情不能上课的老师被辞退聊天记录图 / 受访者供图“被裁员”的例子不在少数。
There are many examples of teachers who were unable to attend classes because of the epidemic being fired.
优胜教育顺义校区市场专员与课程顾问邓秋雨于2019年7月入职，根据他的说法，疫情期间他被要求每天在家打150个电话卖课，“2月24日，校长跟我说公司经营情况不太好，要优化员工，让我自己写因个人原因申请辞职，未来等公司线下开了可以再重新入职。
According to Deng Qiuyu, marketing specialist and course consultant at Yue Shun Yi School District, who entered office in July 2019, he was asked to make 150 phone calls a day to sell lessons during the epidemic. "On February 24, the headmaster told me that the company was not doing well.
我没有填写，2月25日早上校长就把我移出了所有的工作群，现在打卡也打不了。
I didn't fill it out. On the morning of Feb. 25, the headmaster moved me out of all the workgroups and now I can't punch a card.
”一部分员工欠薪和被裁员，在岗员工则反馈目前优胜教育的考核机制非常严格，要求所有的老师转型销售，全员卖课，课程套餐有买10送10、买60买送60、买90送100等。
Some employees are behind in their salaries and laid-off, while those on the job respond that the current review mechanism for competitive education is stringent, requiring all teachers to switch to sales, sell full-time, offer packages ranging from buy 10 to 10, buy 60 to deliver 60, and buy 90 to 100.
优信教育的营销广告图 / 受访者供图一周上20个小时的课，卖出120课时的课程，否则就强制离职或转兼职，如此激进的营销方式也引来了很多老师的不满。
A marketing poster / interviewee for Youxin Education offers 20 hours of classes a week and 120 hours of courses to sell. Otherwise, the aggressive marketing approach has attracted a lot of teachers' dissatisfaction.
优胜教育长沙少年宫校区的老师小梅表示：“2月份校区开始转线上课，但很多家长不愿意接受，因为价钱一样，线上课程效果不好，学校也有网课，另外家长也不愿意让学生长时间盯着手机或电脑。
Xiao Mei, a teacher at Changsha Children's Palace Campus in Yue Shing, said: "The school district began to switch classes in February, but many parents were reluctant to accept it because of the same price, the poor results of online classes, the availability of online classes and the reluctance of parents to allow students to stare at their cell phones or computers for long periods of time
但校区要求我们说服家长上课，刚开始每个老师一个月消课突破0就可以，后来改成突破10、20小时，现在改成一周20小时了，否则就要被迫离职或转兼职。
However, the campus requires us to persuade parents to attend classes, every teacher just a month to break through 0, later changed to break out of 10, 20 hours, now changed to 20 hours a week, otherwise will be forced to leave or part-time job.
”有校区的销售手段更为激进，当天卖课，第二天会发课程总价10%的提成到员工卡里，有日薪、周薪等激励机制。
Some campuses sell more aggressively, selling classes the same day and handing out a 10 per cent commission on the next day, with incentives such as daily and weekly salaries.
“校区还要求我们做营销，一个月要新卖出120课时才能给工资。
"The campus also requires us to do marketing, to sell 120 hours a month to pay wages.
校区的说法是卖的课越多工资来得就越快，到现在我勉强上满了20节课，新课程一节都没卖出去。
The school district says that the more classes I sell, the faster I get paid. By now I barely have 20 classes and I haven't sold a new one.
”小梅提到。
"said little May.
关于薪资发放问题，2月12日，优胜教育曾发布全员信表示，公司在疫情之下制定了短期内紧急员工工资发放规则，“在保障员工基本条件满足的情况下，按期发放一定比例的工资，未能及时发放的将于今年4月份开始陆续进行补偿发放。
On February 12, Yum Win Education issued a letter to its staff saying it had set short-term emergency payroll rules in the face of the epidemic. "The company will pay a certain percentage of salaries as scheduled, subject to the basic conditions of its employees.
教师岗位还将获得5%以上线上授课额外激励。
Teachers will also be given an additional incentive to teach online by more than 5 per cent.
”20年老牌教育机构早有合同、运营纠纷据官网介绍，优胜教育集团成立于1999年，开启了教育行业OMO先河，融合线上教学、中心授课、到家辅导，实现从线上到线下，从校区到上门的全场景教育服务。
Established in 1999, Yum Shing Educational Group was founded in 1999 to set up the first OMO educational industry, integrating online teaching, central teaching, home tutoring and providing on- and off-line, door-to-door, all-scene educational services.
优胜教育全国校区分为直营、代管和加盟三种类型，有1500多个校区，约1.3万名员工。
The National Campus is divided into three categories: direct, escrow and affiliation, with more than 1,500 campuses and approximately 13,000 employees.
燃财经了解到，在疫情之前，优胜教育就开始显现资金和运营问题。
Flaming Finance understands that prior to the outbreak, Yum Shing Education began to show funding and operational problems.
北京总部品牌部内容运营小宇在2019年12月主动离职，但欠着的9000多元薪资至今都没有发。
Xiaoyu, the content manager of the Beijing headquarters, left her job in December 2019, but is still owed more than 9,000 yuan in unpaid wages.
天津刘园校区的阳阳也告诉燃财经，“1月份我们的工资就没发，1月20号左右有传言说总部要放弃我们校区，就有家长来退费，有一次一个家长和工作人员吵架吵得很凶，校区第二天就关门了。
Yangyang, of Tianjin's Liu Campus, also told Flaming Finance that "our salaries were not paid in January, and there were rumors around January 20th that the head office would give up our campus.
”到2月3日校区要线上办公，后来阳阳才得知她和几个态度强硬要求发工资的老师都“被离职”了，微信群和钉钉都移除了，欠着她1万元左右的工资和几千块钱医保报销费用。
It was not until February 3, when the school district went online, that Yang learned that she and several tough-line teachers had been "laid off" and that the micro-mail and nail clips had been removed, owing her about 10,000 yuan in salary and thousands of dollars in medical insurance reimbursement.
此外，维权群多位优胜教育员工表示遇到社保和合同纠纷。
In addition, advocacy groups of many winning education workers said they encountered social security and contract disputes.
优胜教育劲松校区的小雪2019年在优胜教育工作5个月，离职后才发现公司一直没给她交社保，提交了仲裁发现自己的合同有问题，“首先，我合同的甲方不是优胜教育的主体公司优胜辉煌有限公司，而是北京宏志胜文教育咨询有限公司，其次，合同显示试用期六个月签的是非全日制合同，合同里回避了试用期相关词汇，条款里写着每周工作24小时，其余都算自愿加班，但事实上我们上的都是全日制的班，非全合同其实是一种兼职合同，不受劳动法完全保护。
First of all, Party A of my contract is not the main company of winning education, but the contract shows that the probationary period is signed by part-time contract, the terms of which say 24 hours a week, the rest of the contract is a part-time contract, which is not fully protected by the labor law
”小雪还提到，“校区让我们老师配合销售卖课，自己感觉老师根本不是在上课，而是想尽一切办法消课、卖课。
"The school district asked our teachers to cooperate in selling lessons," she said. "I felt that the teacher was not teaching at all.
”还有人反馈：“校区整体特别注重销售，如果能拉来学员就会有奖金，认真上课的老师并没有什么奖励。
"There was also feedback:" The school district as a whole pays special attention to sales, there are bonuses if students are recruited and there are no rewards for serious teachers.
”优胜教育内部还存在一个现象就是“分卡”，公司要求员工在自己的工资卡之外再登记一张家人或朋友的工资卡，每月工资分两笔分别发在两个卡里，“说是对我们好，为了避税。
There is also a "scorecard" inside Yousheng Education, which requires employees to sign up for a family or friend's paycheck in two separate monthly paychecks -- "It's good for us, to avoid taxes.
”优胜教育工作群里通知员工分卡图 / 受访者供图针对员工反映的问题，燃财经致电优胜教育总部客服和城市经理求证，对方均要求留下联系方式，称将会派负责人联系。
Staff were notified of the points / respondents' feedback in the winning education group, and Flaming Finance called the Yum Shing Education Headquarters Customer Service and the City Manager for confirmation, all of whom asked to leave contact details saying they would send someone in charge.
随后一位自称优胜教育法务的女士联系燃财经，回应了一些问题，期间她多次“提醒”燃财经，员工所言不客观、也不全面，未经考证发布将追究法律责任。
A woman who claimed to have excelled in education and law answered a number of questions during which she repeatedly "alerted" to the issue of finance and economics.
该法务称其回应内容经确认后可以发布，但在与其确认内容时又表示：“今天的话仅代表我个人”。
The solicitor said the content of his response could be released after confirmation, but added: "Today's remarks only represent me personally."
以下是主要回应内容：有关欠薪问题：疫情期间公司在竭尽全力分批发放工资，未来可能要应对三四个月收入极少的状况，不可能按照原来的进度发，未来会陆续补充发放。
The following are the main responses: With regard to salary arrears, companies are making every effort to pay their salaries in batches during the epidemic, and may have to deal with very little income for three or four months in the future.
优化问题：这中间可能有一些个例，但成千上万的员工在跟我们一起努力。
Optimization: There may be a few examples, but thousands of employees are working with us.
整体上公司希望尽量保留更多的战友，让更多人突破自己。
On the whole, the company hopes to retain as many comrades as possible, so that more people break through themselves.
同时，疫情期间跟不上公司的步伐和要求，创造不出价值的员工，有一定的优化是合法合理的，流程上疫情期间可能有不规范的地方，现在是艰苦的时候我们希望员工尽量配合。
At the same time, the epidemic period can not keep pace with the company's pace and requirements, create valuable staff, there is a reasonable degree of optimization is legitimate, the process may have irregularities during the epidemic, is now a difficult time we want staff to cooperate as much as possible.
全员销售：全员销售是很多公司使用的方法，之前公司成熟、分工细化没有要求老师销售，现在调整了业务模型要求全员销售也很正常。
Full sales: Full sales is the method used by many companies, the company mature, division of labor did not require teachers to sell, now adjusted business models to require full sales is normal.
合同问题：我们跟员工的合同分全日制和非全日制两种，两种在社会福利缴纳上不同，合同表述很清晰，是员工自愿签订的，不存在问题。
CONTRACT ISSUE: Our contract with the employee is divided into full-time and part-time, the two are different in social welfare contributions, the contract is clearly stated, it is signed voluntarily by the employee, and there is no problem.
创始人参加电视招聘节目受关注曾自称压力大到想跳楼公开资料显示，优胜教育创始人、董事长陈昊，1978年出生，对外经济贸易大学硕士，出生于书香门第家庭，父亲陈传平是中国著名数学家、中科院研究员、博士生导师，母亲唐芳琼是中国著名科学家、中科院研究员、博士生导师。
Founder and chairman Chen Hao, born in 1978, was born in Xuxianmen family. His father, Chen Chuanping, is a famous Chinese mathematician, researcher of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and doctoral supervisor.
陈昊1999年涉足教育领域，研究中小学生个性化教育项目。
Chen Hao dabbled in the field of education in 1999, studying individualized education projects for primary and secondary school students.
陈昊曾是常驻《非你莫属》节目的BOSS团成员之一，在节目上常常怼求职者，其犀利表现引起了很多人关注。
Chen Hao used to be a member of the BOSS group who lived on "You Are You" and often resented the candidates on the program.
陈昊参加《非你莫属》节目同时，陈昊在节目《异想天开》中也曾分享过自己的创业经历，尤其是失败的教训。
Chen Hao participated in the program "You More than You," Chen Hao in the program "Fantasia" has also shared their own entrepreneurial experience, especially the failure of the lessons.
他提到，2007年的时候，优胜教育一年有近2000万利润，当时请了咨询公司谋求继续做大，借鉴海外连锁企业的经验，没料到吃了大亏。
In 2007, Yum's annual profits were close to 20 million, he notes, when consulting firms were hired to seek further expansion, drawing on the experience of overseas chains and not expecting big losses.
当时做了几件事，第一就是去中间化，将优胜教育的5级管理体系优化掉两级，裁掉将近1/3约500人，“整个结构就很飘了，也伤了很多员工的心，人心也更涣散了。
The first was to de-centralize and optimize the five-tier management system of competitive education, cutting nearly a third of the workforce by nearly one-third. "The whole structure is very unwieldy, it hurts a lot of employees, and the people are less willing to take it up
”另外优胜教育还听从咨询公司的建议在全国扩张上采用了核心城市打法，而没有集中在几片主要的地区，造成了人才配比不合理，整个模式设计偏差。
In addition, Yousheng has followed the advice of consulting firms and adopted a core city approach to national expansion rather than concentrating on a few major areas, resulting in an unreasonable talent mix and an overall pattern design bias.
第二年新开店大幅亏损，总部补贴了两三千万，第三年就基本开不下去了。
The following year, the new shop opened a substantial loss, the headquarters subsidies of twenty-three million, the third year on the basic can not go on.
到了2009年，公司的钱掏干净，陈昊个人开始卖房子、抵押车，为了面子苦撑了一段时间，后来开始陆续关店止损。
In 2009, the company's money paid clean, Chen Hao began to sell individual houses, mortgage cars, in order to face a period of hardship, and later began to close shop stop losses.
“我那时候都是打车到公司前一站下车走到公司，怕员工看到我的车没了，等员工下班都走了再偷偷打车回家。
"I used to take a taxi to the front of the company and get off at the company, so the employees wouldn't see my car gone, and then we'd steal a taxi home after work.
压力大的时候脾气也大，有一次我一拳就把电脑打碎了。
I have a bad temper when I'm under stress. Once I smashed the computer with one blow.
怕伤人，后来告诉助理我一发脾气就把门关上，回家怕伤了爱人孩子，我就搬出去自己住，一住就是9年。
Afraid of hurting people, I told the assistant to close the door as soon as I lost my temper, afraid to hurt my loved one's children, I moved out to live in my own house for nine years.
最惨的时候，我每天一回家就拿沙发把阳台门堵住，担心自己跳楼。
Worst of all, as soon as I get home, I get a sofa to block up my balcony door and worry about jumping out of the building.
”陈昊回忆。
Chen Hao recalled.
他坦陈自己做事有时候有点赌博的性质，觉得赔得起，把资金看成了重要资源，有一些误区。
He confessed that he sometimes do something a bit gambling nature, feel worthy of money as an important resource, there are some misunderstandings.
从低谷走出来以后，很长一段时间陈昊都走保守策略，稳步发展，即使公司运营数据非常好也不会快速拓展。
After coming out from the trough, Chen Hao took a conservative strategy for a long time, steadily developing, even if the company's operating data is very good will not expand quickly.
到后来公司缓过来的时候，陈昊还做了不少新项目和投资，“2012年O2O火的时候，我门推出了一个APP叫师傅到家，也就是老师上门上课，半年烧钱六七百万。
Later, when the company came back, Chen Hao also made a lot of new projects and investments, "O2O fire in 2012, we launched an APP called home, that is, teachers door-to-door classes, six or seven million six-month money.
还做过国际教育亏了几百万，我个人投资项目花费有2亿多元，有些项目可能还能收回来。
I have lost millions in international education. I have spent more than $200 million on my personal investment projects, some of which may still be recovered.
”最后他提到，创业路上要不断学习，要小步快跑不要好高骛远，还一定要重视团队。
Finally, he mentioned that it was important to keep learning on the road to entrepreneurship, that small steps should not be over-ambitious and that teams must be valued.
2019年，同样是20年老牌教育机构的韦博英语陷欠薪、倒闭跑路风波，维权的家长、员工声势浩大，引发广泛关注。
In 2019, Weibo, also a 20-year-old educational institution, was caught up in a wave of unpaid salaries and failed schools.
优胜教育需要警惕陷入类似的被动局面。
Excellence in education requires vigilance in getting into a similar passive situation.
疫情之下，不少企业经营中断，不仅没有收入，还得照常负担房租、人力等成本，现金流危机一触即发。
Under the epidemic, many enterprises business interruption, not only no income, but also have to pay rent, manpower and other costs, cash flow crisis is imminent.
为了活下去，企业只能断臂求生、积极自救，不过，在压缩成本、缩减人员的过程中，与员工和客户坦诚、平等地沟通十分重要。
In order to survive, enterprises can only break arms to save themselves, but in the process of reducing costs and personnel, frank and equal communication with employees and customers is very important.
在守法合规的前提下，争取员工的理解和配合可以减少企业倒闭的风险。
On the premise of compliance with the law, the understanding and cooperation of employees can reduce the risk of business failure.
反之，倘若做不好沟通工作则有可能适得其反、加速死亡。
Conversely, failure to communicate well can backfire and accelerate death.
燃财经认为，优胜教育需要在自救的方式上更加有同理心和人情味，遭受损失的员工也应该充分理解公司的难处并积极协商解决方案。
Flaming Finance believes that winning education needs to be more empathetic and humane in its approach to self-help, and that employees who suffer losses should fully understand the company's difficulties and actively negotiate solutions.
特殊时期，大家需要共克时艰。
In special times, we need to overcome difficulties together.
