”1月25日，大年初一，汕头八合里海记牛肉火锅（下称“八合里”）的营业额是平时的十分之一。
On January 25, the first day of the Lunar New Year, Shantou octopus beef pot (hereinafter referred to as "octopus") turnover is one-tenth of the usual.
没有客人，八合里的老板林海平才发觉疫情对生意的影响超过了自己的预期，并且防控局势变得严峻，于是自初二开始，八合里陆续停掉了所有门店。
No guests, octopus boss Lin Haiping found that the impact of the epidemic on business beyond their own expectations, and the situation has become serious, since the beginning of the second day of eighth-grade, all the stores have been closed.
春节本是牛肉火锅行业的旺季。
Spring Festival is the season of beef hotpot industry.
随着大城市人群回流，八合里海记在二三线城市的门店都会迎来爆发期。
With the return of large cities, octahetian Caspian recorded in the second and third-tier city stores will usher in an outbreak.
而在一线城市，林海平明显感觉到，近两三年来在北上广深的春节生意也越来越好做。
But in the first city, Lin Haiping obviously felt that in the past two or three years in the north of the Spring Festival business is becoming easier to do.
在日常，要吃到一顿八合里的牛肉火锅，通常要排队2-3个小时。
On a daily basis, an eight-mile beef pot is served, usually in line for two to three hours.
但如今，受到新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情的影响，他形容，“现在是一把清零。
But now, affected by the new coronavirus pneumonia, he described it as "a clean slate."

月损失6000万，现金流只能撑2个月“说真的，我也没想到会这么惨。
With a monthly loss of $60 million, the cash flow is only going to last two months.Seriously, I didn't expect this to happen either.
本来觉得，应该是停个半个月吧，十天半个月应该就能复工吧？谁知道越来越严重了”。
Originally thought, should be stopped for half a month, 10 days half month should be able to resume work? Who knows more and more serious. "
林海平对界面新闻说。
Lin Haiping to the interface news said.
林海平的八合里，曾引领了那场席卷全国的牛肉火锅热。
Lin Haiping's octopus had led the beef pot fever that swept over the country.
出身潮州农民家庭，林海平学历不高，以前只是亲戚家潮汕牛肉丸店里的一名切肉师傅。
Chaozhou peasant family, Lin Haiping education is not high, before only relatives Chaoshan beef pellets shop a butcher.
随后和他哥哥在汕头八合里附近租了一个23平方米的档口，开了一家名为“海记”的牛肉店。
He and his brother then rented a 23-square-meter stall near Shantou's octopus and opened a beef store called "Hai Ji."
这家店就是八合里海记的雏形。
This shop is the prototype of the octopus book.
2015年前后，牛肉火锅成为全国餐饮的热门品类。
Around 2015, beef hotpot has become a popular category in the national catering industry.
据《商界》杂志报道，当时有近400亿元资金在一年内投入了这个市场。
Nearly 40 billion yuan was invested in the market within a year, according to Business magazine.
到2016年，全国范围内有一万家以上的潮汕牛肉火锅。
By 2016, there are more than ten thousand Chaoshan beef hotpot.
八合里海记也顺势崛起，门店由最初的23平方米扩展至1000余平方米，开遍了广州、北京、武汉等国内的13个城市，拥有132家门店。
The octahetian Caspian Sea has also expanded from an initial 23 square meters to more than 1,000 square meters in 13 cities including Guangzhou, Beijing and Wuhan, with 132 stores.
但今年自全面停业开始的第一个月，八合里的损失已经高达约6000万元。
But since the first month of full-scale closure this year, losses at Octopus have reached about $60 million.
这132家门店，平均一家门店的铺租就要30万，这包括店租、人工、还有宿舍成本。
The 132 stores, an average of 300,000 for a shop, include store rentals, labor and dormitory costs.
这部分的硬性支出就总共需要4000万。
This component of hard spending would require a total of $40 million.
此外，人工是一个大问题。
In addition, labour is a major problem.
八合里目前雇佣的员工有约5000人，早先已经休假的员工，暂时还在家中待命。
The company currently employs about 5,000 people, and employees who were on leave earlier are temporarily on standby at home.
取消堂食的门店、春节期间自愿上岗的员工，目前都在协助外卖运营。
Cancellation of parlour stores, Spring Festival volunteer staff, are currently helping to take out the operation.
在营收锐减的情况下，八合里选择了分批发放员工工资，先发一部分，剩下的等情况稳定后补发。
In the case of a sharp decline in revenue, octopus chose to pay staff salaries in batches, a part of the first, the rest of the situation after stabilization.
“但员工应得的一分钱都不会少，哪怕是卖房子来发工资。
"But employees are entitled to not less than a penny, even if they are selling their houses for wages.
”林海平说。
"said Lin Haiping.
而其余的管理公司、供应链、中央厨房、屠宰厂、物流车队还有养殖场，都是配套于门店的服务。
The rest of the management companies, supply chains, central kitchens, slaughterhouses, logistics fleets and fish farms are ancillary to the store services.
门店一停，这些全部都停。
As soon as the store stopped, it all stopped.
“第一个月确实是有约6000万的亏损，第二个月稍微可以控制一下。
"The first month was a loss of about $60m and the second was a little manageable.
现金流，确实只能顶两个月。
Cash flow really lasts only two months.
其实我不是吹的，很多餐饮的现金流，都顶不了两个月不开业。
In fact, I am not blowing, many catering cash flow, are not open for two months.
”林海平说。
"said Lin Haiping.
事实上，全国的餐饮行业都如此被动。
In fact, the catering industry across the country is so passive.
老乡鸡关闭了武汉地区100多家门店，保守估计损失了5亿元；外婆家负责人也表示，每天天亮醒来，就要支付250万元工资，目前看只能苦撑2个月；拥有400多家西贝莜面村餐厅的西贝餐饮，预计春节前后一个月损失营收7亿元至8亿元，2万多名员工一个月支出在1.5亿元左右。
The head of the Grandmother's family said that she would have to pay 2.5 million yuan in wages every day when she wakes up in the morning. The Xibei restaurant, which owns more than 400 Xibei naked-noodle restaurants, expects to lose between 700 million yuan and 800 million yuan in revenue in one month, and over 20,000 employees spend about 150 million yuan a month.
根据中烹协调研数据，相比去年春节，疫情期间，78%的餐饮企业营收损失达100%以上；9%的企业营收损失达到九成以上。
Compared with the Spring Festival last year, 78 percent of catering enterprises lost more than 100 percent of their income, and 9 percent suffered more than 90 percent of the total.
而恒大研究院的数据显示，仅在春节七天内，疫情已对餐饮行业零售额造成5000亿元左右的损失。
In just seven days of the Lunar New Year, the epidemic has cost the restaurant industry about 500 billion yuan, according to the Hang Seng Institute of Research.
外卖成为了自救方式，但杯水车薪和许多餐饮店一样，八合里的第一个自救措施寄望于外卖。
Take-out became the way to save yourself, but like many restaurants, Octopus's first self-help measure was to take it out.
6天前，八合里的即食牛肉丸、牛腩、牛肉火锅家庭套餐纷纷上架，由刚刚恢复营业的部门门店配货，外卖平台负责无接触配送。
Six days ago, ready-to-eat beef balls, sirloin and beef hotpot family meals were put on shelves at department stores that had just reopened, and the take-out platform was responsible for non-contact distribution.

“不过只有20多家门店有开通外卖，而营业额只达到原本这些门店的30%，如何弥补？杯水车薪啊。
"But only about 20 stores have a take-out, and the turnover is only 30 percent of what it used to be.
”目前，八合里还有100多家门店仍在停业。
More than 100 stores are still closed in the city.
开通外卖业务，很大程度上也不是要靠此来弥补全部损失。
Open take-out business, to a large extent, is not to rely on this to make up for all the losses.
林海平打算用这个机会来测试整个团队运营的能力，等疫情过后可以更好的无缝衔接，去直接开业。
Lin intends to use this opportunity to test the ability of the entire team to operate, after the outbreak can be better seamless, to directly open business.
然而这一切的前提，是八合里在第三个月能恢复营业。
The premise of all this, however, was that Octopus could resume business in the third month.
林海平也看到了一些政策性的措施，来解决当下之急。
Lin Haiping also saw some policy measures to address the immediate needs.
譬如中国人民银行等五部门已下发《关于进一步强化金融支持防控新型冠状病毒感染肺炎疫情的通知》，要求对受疫情影响较大的批发零售、住宿餐饮、物流运输、文化旅游等行业，特别是小微企业，不得盲目抽贷、断贷、压贷。
For example, the People's Bank of China and other departments have issued the Notice on Further Strengthening Financial Support for the Prevention and Control of Pneumonia Infected by the New Coronavirus, which calls for wholesale, retail, accommodation, logistics and cultural tourism industries, especially micro and small enterprises, which are more affected by the epidemic situation.
如果第三个月还无法恢复，他考虑卖房但八合里暂时不想考虑金融贷款的援助——他的首选是卖房。
If the third month doesn't recover, he considers selling but Mr. Octopus doesn't want to consider financial-loan bailouts for the time being -- his first option is to sell.
“真的是情况比较严峻的话，你如何来还你的贷款呢？所以，卖房子可能就是比较直接的想法。
"If the situation is really serious, how will you repay your loan? So selling the house may be a more straightforward idea."
”林海平说，“如果真的要卖，这段时间不一定卖的出去呢。
'If you really want to sell it, you don't have to sell it for a while, 'Mr. Lin says.
”这是他的最坏打算，如果到第三个月餐厅还无法恢复正常营业，林海平考虑通过出售自持物业来缓解资金压力。
That is his worst-case scenario, and if the restaurant doesn't get back to normal by the third month, Mr. Lin is considering selling his own property to ease the pressure.

来源：八合里微博在疫情爆发以前，林海平原本想在2020年做2-3个新项目，也计划把八合里扩张30%，开多4、50家门店出来。
Source: Octopus Weibo Before the outbreak, Lin Hai Plain had planned 2-3 new projects in 2020 and planned to expand the octopus by 30%, opening 4 or 50 more stores.
但目前，新项目全部暂停，已经签好合同的新门店只能搁置着，而没有签好合同的项目他决定暂时止步。
But at the moment, all new projects are on hold, new stores with signed contracts have to be put on hold, and he has decided to hold off on projects that have not been signed.
自春节以来，林海平一直留在汕头老家，和所有人一样，宅在家里远程办公，也终于有时间陪陪老婆小孩。
Since the Spring Festival, Lin Haiping has been staying in Shantou hometown, and everyone, home telecommuting, also have time to accompany his wife and children.
他的朋友圈背景设置的是全家人。
His circle of friends set the scene for the whole family.
也尽可能地保持低调，无论在外面赚了多少钱，平时都只喜欢穿着运动服和运动鞋。
Also try to keep a low profile, no matter how much money you make outside, you usually only like to wear sportswear and sneakers.
“没问题的，相信国家，两个月一定没问题的，能控制下去。
"No problem, trust the country, two months is sure to be all right and under control.
”林海平在最后对界面新闻说，“而且我们这一代人从菜市场切牛肉切出来的，怕什么？大不了回去切牛肉咯。
"And what are we afraid of when our generation cuts beef from the vegetable market? It's not big enough to go back to cutting beef."
