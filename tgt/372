到2月7日，武汉已经封城16天了，一条辗转联系上了身在武汉的救援志愿者李雄，通过他的叙述，了解武汉的千万民众，日常生活到底如何？李雄李雄本身是一个小企业主，财务自由，去年10月，他加入了蓝天救援队，那也是中国民间最大的专业紧急救援机构。
By February 7, Wuhan has been closed to the city for 16 days, a rescue volunteers in Wuhan, through his account of the millions of people, how the daily life? Li Xiong is a small business owners, financial freedom, last October, he joined the blue sky rescue team, China's largest civilian professional emergency relief agencies.
疫情爆发后，他第一时间投入到一线的志愿救助工作中。
After the outbreak of the outbreak, he immediately put into front-line volunteer relief work.
封城十六天以来，他的心情随着疫情的发展，经历了过山车一样的变化。
Since the city was closed for 16 days, his mood has changed like a roller coaster as the epidemic unfolded.
“历史选择了武汉，我们和这座城市一起咬紧牙关承担。
"History has chosen Wuhan, we and this city together bear the grind of teeth.
”封城第二天，我所在的蓝天救援队就发起了物资转运的号召。
The day after the siege, my blue sky rescue team launched a call for transit.
前几天我都在帮助运送各种物资。
I was helping with the delivery of supplies the other day.
从1月31日到2月4日，因为120急救中心人手紧缺，我被调去工作了5天。
From January 31 to February 4, I was transferred to work for five days because of a shortage of staff at the 120 Emergency Centre.
志愿者加上正式的工作人员，一共才十几个人。
Volunteers plus regular staff, a total of only a dozen people.
我们来不及培训就直接上岗了，一边操作一边学习，不懂的就马上现场问。
We have no time to train on the direct induction, while operating while learning, do not understand on the spot immediately asked.
上岗前两天，不管我们怎么努力接电话，在线等待的永远有十几个，甚至是几十个。
Two days before taking office, no matter how hard we try to answer the phone, there will always be dozens, even dozens, of people waiting online.
后来情况稍好，两个电话之间可以休息一两秒。
Things turned out a little better, and the two phones could rest for a second or two.
所有人都在高负荷运作，连喝口水的时间都没有。
Everyone is running at high capacity, without even taking a sip.
120平时是三班倒，每班8个小时，现在改成了两班倒，分白班和晚班，早八点到晚八点，一班12个小时。
Instead of working in three shifts of eight hours each, there are now two shifts of 12 hours each in the morning and evening shifts from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
接到电话，我们首先需要确认患者是轻症还是重症。
On the phone, we first need to confirm whether the patient is a mild or severe illness.
轻症的，发烧在38度以内的，就自己在家隔离，重症患者，高烧、无力、想吐、呼吸困难，我们才能出车。
Light illness, fever within 38 degrees, on their own isolation, severe patients, high fever, weakness, vomiting, breathing difficulties, we can travel.
因为我们目前车辆严重不足，市中心这边只有50辆车，如果是运送发热患者的话，每辆车运送完之后都必须消毒，消毒之后还要再放半个小时才能开。
Because we're seriously under-stocked, with only 50 cars in the city center, we have to disinfect every car after delivery, if it's transporting a feverish patient, and leave it for another half an hour after disinfection.
所以一辆车每天算下来，其实运不了几次。
So a car counts down every day, but it can't be shipped several times.
其次，要出车的话，还要确认你是不是已经对接好了医院。
Second, to get out of the car, but also to make sure that you have docked the hospital.
因为不光车力不足，医院也存在病床不足的问题。
Because not only the lack of car capacity, the hospital also has a shortage of beds.
如果医院没有对接好，我们把你送过去了，医院不收，我们还需要把你再送回来，消毒车辆，一来一回，至少一两个小时就耽误了。
If the hospital doesn't dock, we send you over, the hospital doesn't charge, and we need to bring you back, disinfect the car, once, at least for an hour or two.
所以现在120这边的流程是，患者和社区报备，社区报告到卫健委，卫健委联系医院，确认好了床位，再通知街道社区，社区通知患者，患者打电话给我们，我们出车。
So the 120 side of the process is now, patients and the community reported to the health care committee, the Wei health committee contact the hospital, confirmed the beds, and then notify the street community, the community informed the patients, patients call us, we travel.
120救护流程“你是逼着我在家里等死！”这几天，我们接到了很多很多电话，因为我们没办法安排床位，患者很激动，会骂我们，甚至还威胁说要过来杀死我们同归于尽。
120 Ambulance procedures "You are forcing me to wait at home to die!" In recent days, we received a lot of phone calls because we couldn't arrange beds. The patients were so excited that they would scold us and threatened to come and kill us all.
我刚上岗不久就接到一个这样的电话，他说我现在已经这样了，你们120还在推脱，你这是逼着我在家里等死！有的人哭着哀求我们，你一定要帮我想想办法。
I just got a call like this shortly after I took office, and he said I am doing this, you 120 are still refusing, you are forcing me to wait at home! Some people cry and beg us, you must help me do something.
有些人跟我们说话的时候，明显听到他呼吸困难，我们也只能眼睁睁地旁观，没有办法，因为120现在确实解决不了床位——以前120是可以帮忙联系医院的，但现在是特殊情况——我们可以出车送你过去，可是送去以后医院不接收，怎么办？也有一些人会骗车，没有联系好医院，说自己联系好了，让我们出车。
When some people talk to us, they obviously hear him breathing hard, and we can only watch helplessly as we can't, because 120 can help contact the hospital now, but now it's a special case - we can drive you there, but the hospital won't accept it.
前两天我还接到一个电话，说让我们出车送他到雷神山医院，但是雷神山医院那时都还没有对外开放。
Two days ago I also received a phone call saying that let us drive him to Lei Shenshan Hospital, but Raytheon Hill Hospital has not been open to the public.
这种行为我们非常理解，他随时面临着生命的危险，每个人都想求生。
We understand very well that he is always in danger of his life and everyone wants to survive.
我还接过一个美籍华人的电话，他很希望我们能够出车，但是他的情况并没有那么严重。
I also got a call from a Chinese-American who wanted us to get out of the car, but it wasn't that serious.
他在电话里可能想表达一个意思，外籍人士是不是能获得更多的一些关注。
He may be trying to make a point on the phone, whether foreigners can get some more attention.
我委婉地跟他说，我们出车的主要标准还是病征严重指数，在我心里，国籍跟这件事没有关系，生命面前所有人都是平等的。
I gently told him that the main criterion for our trip was the severity of the symptoms. In my mind, nationality had nothing to do with it. All people were equal before life.
最痛苦的可能是空巢老人。
Perhaps the most painful is the empty nest elderly.
子女不在身边，或者是没有子女，两个老人家，都是七八十岁，不怎么会使用网络，信息获取都很滞后，也不知道跟谁去联系是最有效的。
Children are not around, or there are no children, two elderly families, are all 78 or 10 years old, not very able to use the network, information access is lagging behind, and do not know with whom contact is the most effective.
我们很难受很着急，但是也没办法解决。
We are very upset, but there is no way to solve it.
我做这个的头一天，就问过我们有经验的老队友，做这个工作要注意些什么。
The first day I did this, I asked our veteran teammates what to look out for in the job.
他说，你要有心理准备，你接起来的每一个电话，都可能是人间悲剧。
'Be prepared, 'he says.' Every call you answer can be a human tragedy.
我每天要接一两百个电话。
I answer one or two hundred calls a day.
有的人，家里每个人都已经感染了。
Some people, everyone in the family has been infected.
还有的人，全家五口人，可能已经死了两口，还有三口人等着床位。
Still others, a family of five, may have died two, and there are three people waiting for bed.
他们把电话打到120来，可能是已经求助过所有可以求助的渠道了。
They called 120, probably because they had already turned to all avenues of help.
面对这种患者，我经常无言以对。
I am often speechless in the face of such patients.
安慰的话根本没有用，只能把各个电话号码报给他：要不你跟医院打电话试试，要不你跟卫健委打电话试试，这是省卫健委的电话，这是市卫健委的电话，这是区卫健委的电话，甚至如果你不知道的话，你们居委会的电话我帮你查。
Consolation words are of no use to him, you have to call the hospital to try, or you call the health committee to try, this is the phone, this is the city health committee, this is the District Health Commission telephone, even if you do not know, your neighborhood committee phone number I help you to check.
也许正好打通某个电话后，能够碰到一点点希望。
You might be able to run into a little bit of hope right after making a call.
疫情连锁反应：其他的患者无处可去这个病发生以来，我有一个很深的感触：因为这个病，其他病的患者几乎都躲在家里，不敢去医院看病。
Since the disease began, I have had a deep feeling that because of it, almost all other patients have stayed at home and are afraid to go to the hospital.
我接过一个电话，他的老婆要生了，不敢去医院，害怕交叉感染，孩子的脐带都出来了，给我们打电话求救。
I got a phone call, his wife is going to give birth, afraid to go to the hospital, afraid of cross-infection, the child's umbilical cord came out, call us for help.
这种不用他联系医院，我们120马上加急派车。
This doesn't require him to contact the hospital. We'll send an express 120.
我还接过一个电话，说鱼刺不小心卡喉咙里了，弄不下去，已经十天了，想自己扛过去，结果还是有问题，拖了这么久，可能已经引起严重感染了。
I also received a phone call, said the Stinger accidentally stuck in the throat, can not get down, has been 10 days, want to carry their own, the result is still a problem, dragged so long, may have caused a serious infection.
我们遇到的最多的，就是心脏问题，做过支架的，出问题了，请我们救护车快过来。
The most common thing we've had is heart problems, stents, problems. Please ask our ambulance to come quickly.
还有中风的，脑梗的，打电话来，我们能帮他送到哪个医院去？很多医院都爆满了，协和、同济等等医院，已经只接收发热患者了。
There's a stroke, a cerebral infarction, a phone call, which hospital can we take him to? Many hospitals are full, Concorde, Tongji, and so on, have taken in only febrile patients.
我的一个朋友，牙疼得不行了，每天靠吃止疼药扛着。
One of my friends, his toothache was so bad that he carried it on pain medication every day.
而且现在就算他去医院，也没有牙科开。
And even if he went to the hospital now, there was no dental treatment.
还有尿毒症的人，一周三次要做透析，没有地方去。
And people with uremia. They need dialysis three times a week. There's no place to go.
就拿我自己家人说，我开了一家整形医院，我妈妈1月20日在我自己的医院做的去眼袋手术。
Take my own family and say that I run a plastic surgery my mother had in my own hospital on January 20.
按惯例，7天之后要拆线，但是我们医院的整形科医生是外地的，回不来，其他医院也不可能开门接收，开了门，你也未必敢去，万一交叉感染。
It's customary to unwire after 7 days, but our plastic surgeons are out of town and can't get back, and other hospitals can't open doors and open doors, and you don't necessarily dare to go in case of cross-infection.
我妈妈天天在家都要急死了，求我赶紧想办法安排，不然线不及时拆，长到肉里去了，到时候一拉一脸的血。
My mother is anxious to die every day at home, please I hasten to find a way to arrange, or the line does not open in time, long into the meat, the time to pull a face of blood.
直到前天下午，我终于找到了一个医生，安排我妈妈和我们医院的其他顾客解决了这个拆线的问题。
It was not until the afternoon before yesterday that I finally found a doctor and arranged for my mother and the other clients at our hospital to solve the problem.
终于找到医生给妈妈拆线最危险的是超市封城以后，武汉所有大大小小的菜市场都关了，大家买东西没有地方去。
Finally found a doctor to open the line to his mother is the most dangerous supermarket after the closure of Wuhan all the large and small vegetable markets are closed, there is no place to buy things.
生鲜电商在武汉也没有很普及，盒马就那么几家，不是每个区都能送到，接单率也很低，不是你想订就可以有。
Fresh electric business is not very popular in Wuhan, box horse so few, not every district can be delivered, the order rate is also very low, not you want to order can have.
绝大部分人还是只能在家附近的大型超市去买菜。
Most people still have to buy food at a large supermarket near their homes.
大超市的菜场区域，我感觉是现在最危险的地方。
The food market area of the big supermarket, I feel the most dangerous place now.
里面好多人聚集，结账又要排队，超市空间基本都是密闭的，每个人之间不到半米的距离，戴着口罩也还是很危险。
There are a lot of people gathered, checkout and queuing, supermarket space is basically closed, less than half a meter between each other, wearing masks is also very dangerous.
我有一次去买点东西，一看这么多人排队，我把东西放下就走了。
I once went shopping, saw so many people lined up, I put things down and left.
回家以后我就警告爸妈，让他们不要去超市，故意把情况说得再夸张一点，引起他们的重视。
When I got home, I warned my parents not to go to the supermarket, deliberately exaggerating the situation and getting their attention.
以前过年，我最烦的一件事情，就是我爸妈要准备好多年货，炸圆子，腌腊鱼腊肉，自己在家卤海带卤牛肉，吃都吃不完。
In the past New Year, the most annoying thing is that my parents have to prepare many years of goods, fried round fish, bacon bacon, their own halogen halogen beef, eat can not eat.
结果现在这些储备都派上了用场。
As a result, these reserves are now in use.
小区楼下偶尔会有人摆摊子卖点青菜，我们就补充一点。
There will be an occasional stall below the compound to sell vegetables. Let's add one more point.
但是年货的储备吃了十多天以后，到现在也没有了。
But after more than ten days, the stock of New Year's goods is now gone.
到今天早上，家里没有肉了，我只能去超市排队。
By this morning, there was no meat at home, so I had to go to the supermarket in line.
现在新鲜的肉和蔬菜，只有每天超市开门的时候才有，不到半个小时就抢完了。
Fresh meat and vegetables are available only every day when the supermarket opens, and are eaten in less than half an hour.
下午再去超市，人会少很多，但卖的东西只剩下干货，不是必需品。
Afternoon to the supermarket, there will be much less people, but only sold dry goods, not necessities.
我早上9：30到的，超市还没开门，就已经有好多人在门口等着了。
I arrived at 9: 30 in the morning and there were already a lot of people waiting at the door before the supermarket opened.
十点钟门一开，黑压压的人群涌进去，每个人和每个人之间可以说是摩肩接踵。
When the door opens at ten o'clock, the dark crowds crowd in, each and every one of us, so to speak.
我不敢往前挤，怕传染，只能跟在后面。
I dare not push forward, afraid of infection, can only follow behind.
等待超市开门的人群等我进去的时候，买肉买菜的地方已经排了一长条队，快一百米。
As the crowd waited for me to open the door of the supermarket, there was already a long line of groceries, nearly a hundred metres away.
我一看，我肯定买不上了，就转身走了，想其他超市会不会好一点，我就换到盒马去了。
I look, I certainly can not buy, turned around to walk, think other supermarkets will be better, I changed to a box of horses.
等我到了盒马，发现盒马的人更多。
When I got to the box, there were more people in the box.
我到的时候差不多十一点，也没有新鲜肉了，但是至少还有冻肉，羊肉卷、牛肉卷、牛排这些，管他是什么，我统统往购物车里装。
I arrived about eleven o'clock, and there was no fresh meat, but at least there was frozen meat, mutton rolls, beef rolls, steak, whatever he was, and I loaded it all into the shopping cart.
想买一点蔬菜，但是蔬菜也没有了。
I want to buy some vegetables, but there are no vegetables.
我一边排队结账，一边不时跑到旁边的货架上抢一点东西放进购物车。
As I queued up for the checkout, I ran to the next shelf to grab a few things and put them in the shopping cart.
最后结账等了快一个小时。
The final checkout took almost an hour.
爸爸妈妈哀求我不要出门了我自己当了志愿者以后，朋友圈里很多人跟我联系，说他们也想当志愿者。
After my parents begged me not to go out as a volunteer, a lot of people in the community contacted me and said they wanted to volunteer.
大部分人都是年轻人，很多人最后没有当，是爸爸妈妈不允许。
Most of the people are young people, a lot of people did not end up, parents do not allow.
想一下我也能理解。
Think about it and I'll understand.
这个病传染性很强，病愈主要靠自身免疫力。
The disease is highly contagious and depends largely on its own immunity.
我经常玩户外，是属于身体好的那种，但我老爸也担心我，说你搞志愿工作，也不靠这个升官发财，天天不停，每天12个小时，身体怎么吃得消？他已经很不高兴了。
I often play outdoors, but my dad was worried about me, too, because he was worried about my health if you volunteer instead of being promoted and making money every day for 12 hours a day.
我已经把老婆送回娘家住了。
I've sent my wife back to my mother's house.
我现在每天出门戴两个口罩，酒精分装成小瓶，随身带着，走到哪里都喷。
I now wear two masks a day outside. Alcohol is broken into bottles, carried around and sprayed everywhere I go.
上车之前先喷一下，到了急救中心的办公室，也喷一下。
Spray it out before you get on the bus. Go to the emergency center office and spray it.
下班回家，进门之前，全身先喷一下。
Go home from work and spray your whole body before you come in.
回家之后，自己一个人吃饭，在房间里看书追剧运动玩手机。
When I got home, I ate by myself, reading in my room and playing with my mobile phone.
不管怎么样，看书和运动还是要坚持，保持心理和身体健康，才是战胜病毒的最佳方法。
In any case, reading and sports should adhere to, maintain psychological and physical health, is the best way to overcome the virus.
2月4日之后，我从120急救中心的岗位上退下来了。
After February 4, I retired from my position at the 120 Emergency Center.
因为一下子来了四五十个志愿者，我觉得现在这里不缺人了。
Since forty or fifty volunteers have come at once, I think there is no shortage of people here.
为什么我要去做这个工作？因为这个工作缺人我才去做。
Why should I do the job? I'll do it for lack of people.
但是这两天我也没没闲着，还在协调和运送物资。
But I haven't been idle for two days, coordinating and delivering supplies.
2月4日我搞到了一批酒精，当天晚上就在朋友圈里发消息，免费送给家里急缺需要消毒的朋友。
February 4 I got a batch of alcohol, that night in the circle of friends to send news, free of charge to the family in urgent need of disinfection friends.
酒精现在也是一级管控物资了，需要开各种相关证明、介绍信，你购买的用途是什么，用途成立了，才能买到。
Alcohol is now a primary control material, requiring all kinds of relevant certificates of introduction, what you are buying for, and the purpose for which it is used is established.
药店里面基本都断货了。
The drugstores are basically out of stock.
普通人基本都买不到。
Ordinary people can't buy it.
消息发出以后，一个高中同学来找我，她在武汉市儿童医院。
After the news, a high school classmate came to me, she was in Wuhan Children's Hospital.
我很奇怪，说你在医院里，怎么会缺酒精？她说她们一个科室，今天只领到了三瓶酒精，医用的不足，家里需要用的就更没有。
Strange to say that you were in hospital, how could you be short of alcohol? She said that one of their departments had received only three bottles of alcohol today, and that there was a shortage of medical care, and even less needed for the family.
我免费分发这些酒精，本来有一个原则，就是只把东西送给我认识的人，因为我没有办法去照顾到所有的人，我也只是一个普通人。
When I gave away the alcohol for free, it was a rule to give only to people I knew, because I couldn't take care of everyone, and I was just an ordinary person.
但是还是有一个我不认识的人通过朋友来找我。
But there was a man I didn't know who came to me through friends.
他说他母亲确诊了，但是到现在也没有住上院，他每天带着母亲往医院跑，没有酒精，家里也需要消毒。
He said his mother was diagnosed, but so far has not lived in the upper house, he took his mother to the hospital every day, no alcohol, and needs disinfection at home.
他说我可以给你钱，你能不能卖点给我？一桶酒精差不多是20斤，我最后给他留了大半桶。
He said I could give you some money, could you sell me some? A bucket of alcohol was about 20 kilos, and I finally gave him half a barrel.
交接的时候，因为他一直跟他母亲居住在一起，有没有确诊不敢说，但是跟他接触风险也是很高的，我把酒精放在离他车10米的地方，放下就走了。
At the time of the transfer, as he had been living with his mother and had no diagnosis to say, the risk of contact with him was high, and I put the alcohol 10 metres away from his car, put it down and left.
我跟他说，这半桶送给你，你自己下车拿就可以了。
I told him I'd give you the half a barrel and you could just get out of the car and get it yourself.
有朋友来拿酒精的时候，会给我带一包口罩过来，说谢谢你，我们家里缺酒精，但是口罩还有一些。
When a friend comes for alcohol, bring me a mask and say thank you, we don't have enough alcohol in the house, but we have some masks.
有的给我提了一箱牛奶过来，还有的人给我带了几瓶矿泉水。
Some brought me a crate of milk, others brought me a few bottles of mineral water.
还有很多人想要酒精，但是没有车子出行来拿。
There are many people who want alcohol, but no cars to get it.
武汉城区机动车禁行，我每天在路上奔波都是开私家车出行，扣了多少分我也不知道了。
Wuhan city motor vehicles are banned, I travel in the road is driven by private cars, deducted how many points I do not know.
爸爸妈妈每天都哀求我，今天不要出门了。
My parents begged me every day not to go out today.
我也一直在下决心，真的不出门了。
I've been trying to make up my mind not to go out.
但是总是有事需要出去。
But there's always work to do.
今天2月6日，应该是我在外面跑的最后一天吧。
Today, February 6, should be my last day out running.
之前我和几个朋友一起找渠道，想办法买了一些防护鞋、护目镜和酒精，捐给一线奋战的医护人员。
I used to work with a few friends to find ways to buy some protective shoes, goggles and alcohol for our frontline medical staff.
买的时候其实我对这个渠道也没什么把握，反正先把钱打过去。
In fact, when I buy this channel is not sure, anyway, the money to the past.
突然有这样一个机会，你说买还是不买？先买一点再说。
Suddenly have such an opportunity, you say buy or not buy? Buy a little first.
还好前两天通知我到货了，是靠谱的。
Fortunately, two days ago I was informed of the arrival of the goods, is based on the spectrum.
奋战了一天，把护目镜和防护鞋套送到了武汉洪山方舱医院我今天出门跑最后一趟，把东西送到医院。
After a day of fighting, I took my goggles and protective shoes to the Hongshan Square Hospital in Wuhan. I went out for the last run today and took the things to the hospital.
之后我就自己在家隔离。
And then I isolated myself at home.
毕竟，我年轻身体好，可能感染了也没有什么问题，但是万一我把病毒带回家，传染给了我爸妈，他们年纪大，床位资源又这么紧缺，到时候我去哪里给他们找床位、送医院？大家都来向我咨询，我无能为力疫情爆发后，可能因为我一直在外面跑，做各种志愿工作，大家都觉得我很有办法，很多人在微信上向我咨询。
After all, I was young and healthy and probably infected, but in case I brought the virus home to my parents, who were so old and in such short supply of bedspace resources, where would I find beds and hospitals? Everybody came to me and I couldn't help it.
昨天晚上有一个朋友告诉我，她的奶奶86岁了，一个人在家里，疑似发热患者，子女都不在身边。
A friend of mine told me last night that her grandmother was 86 years old, alone at home, suspected feverish, with no children around.
她奶奶的症状已经比较严重了，但是床位安排不上。
Her grandmother's symptoms were already serious, but the beds were not available.
老人生活不能自理，需要有人喂她吃饭。
The old man could not fend for himself and needed someone to feed her.
她问我能不能搞到护目镜、口罩，毕竟，喂饭那么近的距离，普通人都会害怕，但是作为子女，你也不能不管。
She asked me if I could get goggles, masks. After all, ordinary people are afraid to feed so close, but as children, you can't ignore them.
还有一个朋友发微信，问我能不能搞到家用的呼吸机，他妈妈也是疑似患者，呼吸困难，快喘不过来气了。
Another friend wrote to me asking if I could get a ventilator for my family. His mother was also a suspected patient, breathing hard and out of breath.
我很想帮忙，但是我也买不到。
I'd love to help, but I can't either.
昨天晚上我问一个好朋友，我说我搞了点酒精，要不要给你送过去。
I asked a good friend last night if I wanted to bring you some alcohol.
他说他被隔离了。
He said he was in quarantine.
我很惊讶，他和他妈妈一直住在一起，没出去过，为什么会被隔离？他说他妈妈前两天开始不舒服，拍片子，发现肺部感染，他到这个时候还没有任何症状，因为天天和妈妈生活在一起，也去拍片子，发现肺部也存在感染。
I was surprised that he and his mother had been living together and had not gone out, why were they quarantined? He said his mother had been ill the previous two days and had taken pictures and found a lung infection.
于是两人双双被隔离，安排住在武汉这边一个普通的医院里。
So the two of them were isolated and arranged to live in Wuhan on this side of an ordinary hospital.
建设中的方舱医院（图片来源：人民日报微博）新闻上说，武汉要建方舱医院了。
Wuhan is to build a square cabin hospital, according to the news on the People's Daily Weibo.
武汉体育中心已经快改建好了，我有两个朋友在里面做志愿者，每天工作到凌晨三点。
Wuhan Sports Center has been rebuilt soon. I have two friends who volunteer there and work until 3 in the morning.
我看到方舱医院的设施照片之后，觉得有些担心：那么大的一个空间，那么多病床，床和床之间的距离那么近，这会不会造成交叉感染？而且床位是有了，医护人员是不是也能到位？医护人员需要的口罩、手套、防护服是不是也能到位？这些问题希望能有更多的信息给老百姓一个澄清和普及。
When I look at the pictures of the facilities in Fang Cao Hospital, I feel a little worried: so much space, so many beds, so close to the bed, will it cause cross-infection?
每天心情像坐过山车说实话，随着疫情的发展，我们的心情最近是变得有点急躁了。
Everyday the mood is like a roller coaster telling the truth, as the epidemic progresses, our mood has recently become a bit edgy.
2月2日、3日那两天，好像感觉快熬到头了，结果2月4日开始，又紧张起来。
On February 2 and February 3, it seemed as if the end of the season was at an end. As a result, on February 4, tensions began to rise again.
最近大家几乎没有人敢出门了。
Few of us have dared to go out lately.
本来觉得，病毒突然爆发，一线的工作者也是人，谁能保证能一切都做得很好，完全不出一点问题？各单位应急不足，有些是需要问责，但大多数人都还是积极地奋斗着。
Originally, the virus suddenly burst, the front-line workers are also people, who can guarantee that everything can do well, no problem at all? Units inadequate emergency, some need accountability, but most people are still actively fighting.
春节过了，很多城市开始复工，物资问题、人员问题，都应该能得到很好的解决。
After the Spring Festival, many cities began to resume work, material problems, personnel problems, should be able to get a good solution.
但是目前每天发生的事情，总让你感觉慢半拍。
But at the moment, what happens every day always makes you feel slow.
我其实也算是一个私营企业主吧，手下除了一家整形医院之外，还有几家台球吧和餐厅。
I'm actually a private entrepreneur with a few billiard bars and restaurants in addition to a plastic hospital.
这次疫情，损失有多惨重，根本不愿意去想，也不想去算。
This epidemic, the loss of how much, do not want to think, do not want to calculate.
2019年12月18日武汉下雪，李雄拍摄的医院外景医院、台球吧、餐厅处处要交租金，一个月加起来光租金的支出就是二十多万。
Wuhan on December 18, 2019 snow, Li Xiong shot the hospital location hospital, billiard bar, restaurant everywhere to pay rent, a total of one month the total rent is more than 200,000.
员工几十号人，每个人要发工资交社保吧，按武汉市最低工资标准，再加社保医保，一个人的成本差不多1500到2000块钱，我一个月什么进账都没有，工资这一块就要去掉大几万块钱。
Dozens of employees, each pay social security bar, according to Wuhan minimum wage, plus social security health insurance, the cost of a person almost 1500 to 2,000 dollars, I have nothing to pay a month, the wages will be about tens of thousands of dollars.
我不知道国家政策最后会怎么规定，但是对于我来说，疫情期间不开工，还要正常发工资，甚至是按假期发双倍工资，我肯定是做不到的。
I don't know how the national policy will end up, but for me, not starting work during the epidemic, paying regular wages, or even paying double wages for holidays, is something I certainly can't do.
我们医院最贵的医生，一个月底薪就10多万，光几个医生加在一起，两个月公司就破产了。
The most expensive doctor in our hospital, a monthly salary of more than 100,000, just a few doctors together, the company went bankrupt in two months.
未来怎么样，我只能走一步看一步。
What about the future? I have to walk one step at a time.
但我心态也很好，不是我一个人遇到这样的情况，我的情况也不是最惨的。
But my mentality is also very good, not I alone encountered such a situation, my situation is not the most tragic.
最后大家一定能想出办法来的。
In the end, we'll all come up with something.
封城十六天，我们与病毒抗争了十六天，未来还要咬紧牙关，继续抗争下去。
Sealed 16 days, we fought against the virus for 16 days, the future will have to bite the bullet, continue to fight.
有的人说武汉这次牺牲很大，在我看来不存在。
Some people say that Wuhan sacrifice is very big, in my opinion does not exist.
其实放在每个城市，它都会这样做。
In fact, in every city, it will do so.
这只是历史的选择。
This is only the choice of history.
这一次，历史选择了武汉而已。
This time, history has chosen Wuhan.
我们所有人都被迫地去做了我们的选择。
We have all been forced to make our choices.
现在我不后悔自己的决定，希望未来也不会后悔。
Now I do not regret my decision, I hope that the future will not regret.
