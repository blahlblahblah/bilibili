新冠疫情在中国得到控制后，近期已开始在全球肆虐，意大利成为了欧洲版的“湖北”，卫生当局也迫于压力向中国紧急求助。
With the new crown now under control in China, which has recently begun to ravage the world, Italy has become the European version of Hubei, and health authorities are under pressure to turn to China for emergency help.
3 月 10 日，意大利报告了 977 例新增新冠肺炎确诊病例和 168 例新增死亡，累计确诊 10,149 例，死亡人数达 631 例。
On 10 March, Italy reported 977 confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia and 168 new deaths, with a cumulative total of 10,149 confirmed cases and 631 deaths.
意大利疫情最严重的伦巴第大区已升级管控措施，该地区在两周左右时间内新增确诊病例超过 5000 例，累计死亡超 300 人，疫情防控形势严峻，伦巴第政府卫生主管官员透露，在未来 15 天将实施全面“封锁”。
Italy's worst-affected region, Lombardy, has upgraded its controls, with more than 5,000 new cases confirmed and more than 300 deaths recorded in two weeks. The epidemic is under severe control, and Lombardy government health officials say a full "blockade" will be in place for the next 15 days.
而随着疫情爆发升级，意大利总理孔特也紧急宣布一项新的政府法令，从 3 月 10 日凌晨开始生效直至 4 月 3 日，法令要求国民如非工作或健康需要，禁止所有意大利居民跨区域流动，整个意大利将成为疫情封锁区。
And, as the outbreak escalated, Italian Prime Minister Mario Conte urgently announced a new government decree, effective from the early hours of March 10 until April 3, that would prohibit all Italian residents from moving across regions, except for work or health needs, and that Italy as a whole would become a closed zone of the epidemic.
若意大利失守，欧洲全境恐将面临严重的疫情威胁。
If Italy fails, Europe as a whole could face a serious epidemic.
粗略来看，目前意大利的新冠病死率已高达 6.2%，为全球最高。
At 6.2 percent, Italy has the highest rate of new crown deaths in the world.
世界卫生组织在 3 月 3 日曾披露，新冠病毒的全球病死率约为 3.4％，而中国作为新冠疫情暴发最为严重的国家，病死率目前也只是 3.8% 左右。
The World Health Organization revealed on March 3 that the global death rate for the new crown virus was about 3.4 percent, while the death rate in China, the country with the worst outbreak, is just 3.8 percent.
意大利究竟发生了什么？图 | 意大利因疫情死亡人数曲线（来源：worldometers.info）真实的致死率？意大利超高的新冠肺炎病死率，让世人揪心。
What happened in Italy? Italy's high death rate from the outbreak's death curve (source: worldometers.info) is a cause of concern.
但这并不意味着，随着确诊病例的攀升，其中就会有 6.2% 的患者死去。
But that does not mean that 6.2 per cent of patients die as confirmed cases rise.
因为该数据并不是新冠肺炎的真实致死率。
Because the data do not represent the true death rate from Newcastle pneumonia.
目前，各个国家和地区的新冠肺炎病死率差别很大。
At present, the mortality rate of new crown pneumonia varies greatly among different countries and regions.
即使聚焦一个国家，随着疫情的发展，也会发现这个数字一直在变化。
Even if we focus on a country, as the epidemic progresses, we will find that the number is constantly changing.
也就是说，很难套用当前的病死率，来推算已确诊病例中可能造成的死亡人数。
That is, it is difficult to extrapolate the number of deaths that may have occurred in confirmed cases from the current fatality rate.
这种情况是如何产生的？计算传染病致死率的方法很简单，就是用病死人数除以总病例数。
How does this happen? The way to calculate the death rate from infectious diseases is simply to divide the number of deaths by the total number of cases.
但是由于新冠疫情还在发展，这两个数字始终在不断变化，没法计算准确的病死率。
But because the new crown is still unfolding, these two numbers are constantly changing, making it impossible to calculate the exact fatality rate.
所以，目前是通过 “粗病死率” 来估算，即现有病死人数除以已确诊的病例。
So the current estimate is based on a "crude death rate," that is, the number of existing deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases.
这种估算准确程度有待考量，但当样本足够大时，其与实际结果相比就不会很悬殊。
The accuracy of this estimate is considered, but when the sample is large enough, it does not differ significantly from the actual results.
实际上，广泛的测试会降低致死率。
In fact, extensive testing can reduce the fatality rate.
因为首先确诊的病例通常是症状最严重的患者，他们会主动去医院；与之相反，大量的轻症病例不觉得自己生病，或只认为自己得了普通感冒，并不会主动就医，也就没被纳入确诊病例。
Because the first cases diagnosed are usually the most severe, they go to the hospital on their own initiative; by contrast, a large number of light cases do not feel ill or think they have a common cold, do not seek medical attention voluntarily and are not included in the confirmed cases.
根据目前的研究，大多数新冠肺炎病例属于轻度的（占比约 80％）。
According to current research, the majority of cases of new crown pneumonia are mild (about 80 per cent).
这种对比在美国和韩国身上十分明显。
The contrast is evident in the United States and South Korea.
1 月 20 日，美国和韩国在同一天宣布发现首例新冠病毒病例。
On January 20, the United States and South Korea announced the first new cases of the virus on the same day.
六个多星期后，美国疾控中心（CDC）对大约 1500 人进行了新冠病毒的检测。
More than six weeks later, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) tested about 1,500 people for the new crown virus.
与此同时，韩国已经测试了超过 14 万人。
South Korea, meanwhile, has tested more than 140,000 people.
这种迅速反应使韩国在 14 万人检测者中极快确诊了 6000 多例新冠病毒患者，其中有 35 人死亡。
The rapid response enabled South Korea to quickly identify more than 6,000 cases of the new crown virus among 140,000 people tested, 35 of whom died.
这意味着在韩国，新冠肺炎的病死率约为 0.6％。
That means the death rate from pneumonia is about 0.6 percent in South Korea.
而美国的新冠肺炎病死率曾一度高达 5%，原因之一是由于死者主要集中在一家养老院的患病老人；原因之二，就是由于检测的总人数太少。
The death rate from pneumonia in the United States was once as high as 5 percent, partly because the death toll was concentrated in a nursing home and partly because the total number of people tested was too small.
随着检测能力的加强，根据美国疾控中心通报的最新数据，截至当地时间 3 月 10 日晚，全美已有至少 37 个州和华盛顿特区出现新冠肺炎确诊病例，总数至少为 975 例，已有 31 人死亡。
At least 37 states and Washington, D.C., had confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia on the night of March 10, bringing the total to at least 975 and 31 deaths, according to new data reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
由此推算，病死率已下降到大约 3%。
As a result, the fatality rate has fallen to about 3 per cent.
中国的新冠肺炎数据集更大，也更具说服力。
China's new crown pneumonia data set is larger and more convincing.
在疫情暴发早期，中国也曾出现过奇高的粗病死率，如 1 月 1 日至 1 月 10 日间发病的病例，粗病死率高达 17.3%。
In the early stages of the outbreak, China also experienced unusually high crude death rates, such as those from 1 January to 10 January, with a crude death rate of 17.3 per cent.
到 2 月 28 日，中国疾控中心对截止 2 月 11 日的数据——44,672 个新冠病毒感染确诊病例的统计结果显示，病死率为 2.3 %。
By February 28, China's CDC had recorded a 2.3 percent fatality rate for the 44, 672 confirmed cases of new crown virus infection as of February 11.
所以，世界卫生组织一度认为，新冠病毒感染的致死率大约为 2%。
As a result, the World Health Organization once believed that the death rate from Newcastle virus infection was about 2 per cent.
而实际的致死率或许还会远低于 2%。
And the actual death rate may be well below 2%.
《新英格兰医学杂志》在 2 月 28 日发表的社论认为，新冠病毒感染的实际病死率可能远小于 1%，与严重季节性流感相当（病死率 0.1%）。
A February 28 editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine suggested that the actual death rate from Newcastle virus infection could be well below 1 percent, about the same as for severe seasonal influenza (0.1 percent fatality rate).
根据中国 - 世卫组织近期发布的联合报告，新冠病毒感染的粗病死率为 3.8%，根据地区与传播强度会进一步体现差异，如武汉地区为 5.8%，而中国其他地区为 0.7%。
According to a recent joint China-WHO report, the crude death rate for new crown infections is 3.8 per cent, with further differences depending on region and intensity of transmission, such as 5.8 per cent in Wuhan and 0.7 per cent in the rest of China.
如此对比，武汉地区的新冠肺炎病死率，其实并不比意大利目前的数值低多少。
By contrast, the death rate from pneumonia in Wuhan is not much lower than it is now in Italy.
一个合理的推测是，武汉也有大量的轻症患者未被纳入确诊病例。
A reasonable guess is that Wuhan, too, has a large number of patients with mild cases that are not included in the confirmed cases.
许多公共卫生专家预测，针对新冠肺炎的检测数越多，确诊病例越多，病死率就越低，也就越接近真实情况。
Many public health experts predict that the higher the number of tests for new crown pneumonia, the more cases are diagnosed, the lower the fatality rate and the closer it is to the truth.
图 | 意大利西北部，身穿防护服的医护人员抬着一具装有一名 87 岁妇女尸体的棺材（来源：Times of Israel）不过，一个值得思考的问题是：意大利在欧洲国家中，是检测人数最多的。
WHAT & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; A coffin containing the body of an 87-year-old woman.
根据公开资料，该国已对约 54,000 人进行了测试。
According to publicly available information, some 54,000 people have been tested in the country.
按照前面的分析，不是应该更接近真实的致死率吗？这里就要提一下意大利的检测政策，它或是导致更高的病死率原因。
In the light of the preceding analysis, shouldn't it be closer to the true death rate? Here's a mention of Italy's testing policy, which may have contributed to the higher fatality rate.
意大利在筛查中，将测试重点放在症状明显且已知与高风险地区有接触的人。
In Italy, screening focused on people with significant symptoms and known exposure to high-risk areas.
这意味着许多携带病毒但症状轻微或没有症状的人或许并没接受测试；此外，在意大利可能还有很多轻微的病患没被发现。
This means that many people with the virus, but with mild or no symptoms, may not have been tested; in addition, there may be a lot of mild cases undetected in Italy.
通常情况下，随着检测规模在社区内的扩大，理应会发现更多较轻的病例，从而降低总体致死率。
Often, as the scale of testing expands within the community, it should be possible to detect more minor cases, thereby reducing the overall mortality rate.
“我们可能不知道到底有多少人被感染了，” 天普大学公共卫生学院的流行病学家 Krys Johnson 表示，意大利的真实致死率应该接近 3.4% 的全球致死率。
"We probably don't know how many people are infected," says Krys Johnson, an epidemiologist at the University of Temple of Public Health. "The true death rate in Italy should be close to the global death rate of 3.4%.
老龄化突出和紧张的医疗资源抛开病死率偏差的讨论，意大利居于全球第一的新冠肺炎病死率，确实跟其在此次疫情防控中的诸多不利因素，有直接关系。
Aging and strained medical resources aside the discussion of mortality bias, Italy is the world's leading cause of death from pneumonia, which is directly related to its many disadvantages in the prevention and control of the epidemic.
首先，一个影响因素可能是人口年龄。
First, one factor may be the age of the population.
根据意大利国家统计局的数据显示，截至 2019 年 1 月，意大利总人口约为 6039 万人，65 岁以上人口为 1380 万，占总人口的 22.8%。
According to ISTAT data, as of January 2019, Italy's total population was about 60.39 million, with 13.8 million persons over 65 years of age, or 22.8 per cent of the total population.
其老龄化程度仅次于日本，居全球第二。
It is the second most aging country in the world after Japan.
新冠病毒号称是“老年人杀手”，意大利新冠死亡患者高龄化现象十分显著，官方披露，死者基本都在 50 岁以上，其中 80 岁到 89 岁的占比最高（约 45%），还有 14.1% 的死亡患者超过 90 岁。
The new crown virus claims to be an "old-age killer," with deaths in Italy's new crown apparently occurring at an advanced age, with officials reporting that the majority of the dead are over 50 years of age, with the highest proportion aged 80 to 89 (about 45 per cent) and 14.1 per cent of deaths over the age of 90.
图｜人口老龄化国家排名（来源：UN Population Division）密歇根大学流行病学副教授奥布里 · 戈登（Aubree Gordon）表示，总体病死率总是取决于一个国家的人口统计学特征。
The overall fatality rate always depends on a country's demographic characteristics, says Aubree Gordon, associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan.
她说，在这种情况下，报告的病死率并不是 “年龄标准化” 的，而 “年龄标准化” 是根据潜在的人口统计数据进行调整的一种方法。
Under these circumstances, she says, the reported fatality rate is not "age-standardized," which is a way to adjust for potential demographic data.
考虑到意大利的老年人口，“在其他条件相同的情况下，他们的平均病死率会更高。
Given Italy's elderly population, "other things being equal, the average fatality rate is higher."
”根据此前研究，对于新冠病毒更敏感和更危险的是老年人，从 65 岁开始，其危险性与年龄同步增加（意大利卫生部门报告，新冠患者的平均死亡年龄为 81 岁）。
According to previous research, older people are more sensitive and at greater risk for the new crown virus, with the risk increasing in step with age from age 65 (Italy's health ministry reports an average age of 81 for new crown patients).
在这一流行病浪潮中确认的病例中，几乎 2/3 死亡病例都是有既往病史的老年人。
Almost two thirds of the confirmed cases in this epidemic are older persons with a previous medical history.
而意大利与病毒大暴发相匹配的医疗资源捉襟见肘。
And Italy's health-care resources, which matched the outbreak, are stretched.
据美联社 3 月 10 日报道，在意大利受疫情影响最严重的北部地区，新冠病毒感染人数呈指数级增加，医生们只能参照“战时分诊”的原则，来决定谁能获得有限的 ICU 床位。
Doctors can only decide who has access to a limited number of ICU beds on the basis of a "war-time clinic," with an exponential increase in the number of people infected with the virus in Italy's most affected northern region.
意大利北部皮埃蒙特医生协会会长吉多 · 朱斯蒂托博士表示，“我们通常不会在正常情况下这么做，只是因为床位太少，有些人可能无法获得医疗资源，事情才逐渐变得戏剧化。
Dr. Guido Giustito, president of the Association of Doctors of Piedmont in northern Italy, said: "We don't normally do this because beds are so few that some people may not have access to medical resources.
我们不得不在 40 岁的病人和 60 岁的病人之间选择… 这太残酷了。
We have to choose between a 40-year-old patient and a 60-year-old patient... this is cruel.
”处理新冠肺炎紧急情况的医生和护士已经在满负荷工作了。
Doctors and nurses dealing with the new crown pneumonia emergency are already working at full capacity.
加班加班，经常生病，伦巴第大区医生丹尼尔 · 麦基尼（Daniele Macchini）3 月 7 日在 Facebook 帖子中说：“这就像一场战争爆发，我们日夜都在战斗。
"It's like a war, we fight day and night," Daniel Macchini, a doctor in Lombardy, said in a Facebook post on March 7.
”根据意大利卫生官员披露的信息，意大利头号疫区，即经济最发达的伦巴第大区约 10% 的医务工作者已被感染。
According to Italian health officials, about 10 per cent of health workers in Italy's most economically developed region, Lombardy, have been infected.
目前，当地 70% 的外科手术已被迫延期，当地其他门诊服务也因调拨人员而将从 3 月 9 日后全部暂停。
Currently, 70 per cent of local surgical operations have been postponed and other local outpatient services will be suspended from 9 March owing to the redeployment of personnel.
至此，伦巴第地区的医疗资源已彻底被新冠疫情所消耗。
So far, medical resources in Lombardy have been completely depleted by the new crown.
3 月 1 日，伦巴第大区检出 984 名新冠患者，但只能在全区 900 个床位中挤出 120 个传染病床位用于救治患者。
On 1 March, 984 new cases were detected in the Lombardy region, but only 120 out of 900 beds were made available to treat patients.
这种收治紧张的局面导致意大利无法快速收治全部患者，只能要求 51% 的轻症新冠患者“回家隔离”，这一安排又有可能导致部分轻症患者因不能及时得到收治而转为重症。
As a result, Italy is unable to treat all patients quickly, requiring 51% of new cases to "go home and be quarantined," a practice that threatens to turn some of the patients into serious illnesses by failing to receive treatment in time.
伦巴第危重症监护病房负责人安东尼奥 · 佩森蒂（Antonio Pesenti）预测：“到 3 月 26 日，我们将有 1.8 万个新冠病人，其中 3000 人需要呼吸辅助。
Antonio Pesenti, head of the critical care unit in Lombardy, predicts: "By March 26, we will have 18,000 new patients, 3,000 of whom will need respiratory assistance.
”即便是能安排进重症监护室的病人，医疗器械的紧急配备也将备受考验，直接影响救治效果。
Even for patients who can be placed in intensive care, the emergency equipment will be tested, directly affecting the outcome.
图 | 意大利的病房（来源：Reuters）公共医疗紧急补课意大利的医疗体系过往一直被世人所称赞，意大利公民终身享有公费医疗，不管大病小病，一律不收取费用。
Italy's health-care system has long been hailed as free of charge for all but minor ailments. Italy's health-care system has long been admired.
不少网友评论，意大利的医疗系统在整个欧洲来说其实算是先进级别的，但是意大利在疫情初始阶段的掉以轻心导致了今天的结果。
Many netizens have commented that Italy's health-care system is in fact advanced across Europe, but Italy's carelessness in the initial stages of the epidemic led to today's results.
意大利问题研究专家、中国社会科学院欧洲研究所研究员罗红波日前在接受北京日报采访时表示，意大利其实是最早采取防控措施的国家之一，但文化传统、生活习惯、国家体制、民众性格、医疗体系等多重因素作用下，近 40 天的防控黄金期被白白浪费，导致疫情最终暴发。
Italy was one of the first countries to adopt preventive and control measures, but nearly 40 days of control and control were wasted, leading to an outbreak of the disease, Lu Hongbo, an expert on Italy and a researcher at the European Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Beijing Daily.
一个深层原因是自 2008 年以来，意大利先后遭到国际金融危机、欧洲主权债务危机和经济危机的影响，经济下滑明显。
One deep reason is that, since 2008, Italy has been affected by the international financial crisis, the European sovereign debt crisis and the economic crisis, with a marked economic downturn.
同时，政府为了降低国债在 GDP 中的比率，不得不削减财政预算，公共医疗卫生系统预算受到很大影响。
Meanwhile, the government has had to cut its budget to reduce the ratio of public debt to GDP, which has had a big impact on the public health system budget.
最近 5 年，意大利有 758 家医疗机构关门；而从 2009 年至今，医生的缺口人数已累积为 5.6 万人，护士缺口则是 5 万人。
In the last five years, 758 medical institutions have closed in Italy; from 2009 to date, the number of doctors has accumulated to 56,000, leaving a gap of 50,000 nurses.
在这种情况下疫情突然暴发，不是医疗水平的问题，而是医疗服务体系“心有余而力不足”。
In this case, the outbreak is not a matter of medical standards, but of the health-care system "willing but inadequate."
尽管意大利国家卫生服务机构（Servizio Sanitario Nazionale，SSN）有意为患者提供免费的全民医疗服务，但资金投入逐年不足极大影响了该决定。
Although the Italian National Health Service (Servizio Sanitario Nazionale (SSN)) intends to provide free universal health care for patients, the lack of funding over the years has greatly affected this decision.
根据博科尼大学的最新报告，意大利公共医疗保健的投资仅占该国国内生产总值（GDP）的 6.8％ ，比法国的 11.3% 和英国的 8.7% 都少。
According to a recent report by the University of Boconi, public health care in Italy accounts for only 6.8 per cent of the country's gross domestic product, down from 11.3 per cent in France and 8.7 per cent in the United Kingdom.
博科尼大学学者 Francesco Longo 表示，这代表在紧急情况下国家没有足够资源来应对。
This, says Francesco Longo, an academic at Boconi University, means countries do not have sufficient resources to respond in emergency situations.
伦巴第老年人诊所的卫生主管洛伦佐 · 卡萨尼说：“护理和研究的持续削减目前显然是一个问题。
"Continuing cuts in care and research are clearly a problem right now," said Lorenzo Casani, director of health at Lombardy's Clinic for the Elderly.
” “我们没有做好准备。
"" We weren't ready.
我们没有足够的医生来为人民服务。
We do not have enough doctors to serve the people.
我们没有针对大流行的全面组织计划。
We do not have a comprehensive organizational plan for a pandemic.
”为了尽快弥补医疗资源的窟窿，当地时间 3 月 7 日，意大利总理孔特签署了最新法令，政府将以征调、高薪聘用和军方力量等方式，加速扩充抗疫医疗队伍人力，征调全国各地医疗机构 5 万名专科医生、10 万名护士、5 万名卫生工作者投入疫情严重地区。
Conte, Italy's prime minister, signed a decree on March 7 to speed up the expansion of the country's medical corps by recruiting more doctors, more than 100,000 nurses and 50,000 health workers from all over the country to fill the gap in medical resources.
伦巴第大区负责人甚至要求各大学在本学年早些时候授予学位，以增加意大利的护士人数。
The head of the Lombardy region even asked universities to grant degrees earlier in the academic year in order to increase the number of nurses in Italy.
法令要求，各级卫生医疗机构立即扩增呼吸治疗病房的设备和仪器，将全国的呼吸重症监护室扩增 50%，从原本的 5000 个床位扩增至 7500 个床位，各医院肺部治疗部门和传染病治疗部门将增加一倍以上。
The decree calls for the immediate expansion of equipment and equipment in respiratory care units at all levels, the expansion of respiratory intensive care units nationwide by 50 per cent, from 5,000 beds to 7,500 beds, and the number of pulmonary and infectious disease treatment units in hospitals to more than double.
同时向财政部提出，立即从紧急预算 75 亿欧元中拨付 10 亿欧元，作为扩充医疗队伍和设施的紧急拨款。
At the same time, the Ministry of Finance was requested to disburse Euro1 billion immediately from the emergency budget of Euro7.5 billion as an emergency allocation for the expansion of medical teams and facilities.
无疑，所有这些的资源配备和人员调集仍需要一些时间落地，而疫情的防控却要争分夺秒。
There is no doubt that it will take some time for all of this to come to fruition, but the control of the epidemic will take time.
封锁令下，人员流出难以管控针对当前疫情，意大利当局目前意欲采取类似于中国湖北武汉的医疗防控措施和封锁管制，全国 6000 万人除了工作和紧急事件不得跨区域流动，所有公众活动和体育活动都被勒令停止。
In response to the current outbreak, which is difficult to control under the embargo, the Italian authorities now intend to adopt medical prevention and control measures similar to those in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China, where 60 million people are not allowed to move across regions except for work and emergencies, and all public and sporting activities are suspended.
但这些措施很难像中国那样得到严厉贯彻。
But these measures are unlikely to be implemented as rigorously as in China.
在中国，中央疫情防控政令一发布，从大城市到农村几乎都严阵以待，快速执行防控要求；而意大利国家体制的特点，在应对紧急疫情上展现出了松散的一面。
In China, almost everything from big cities to rural areas is ready for rapid implementation of prevention and control orders, while the features of the Italian state system show a loose face in responding to emergencies.
意大利在国家公职方面实行最广泛的行政上的地方分权，所有的组织和管理机制都依赖于地方。
Italy has the broadest administrative decentralization in the public service, and all the organizational and regulatory mechanisms depend on the local level.
这就使得中央、地方在防控执行上的协调难以统一，中央政府的有些措施政令不能很快并有效贯彻到地方。
This makes it difficult for the central and local governments to coordinate the implementation of control measures, and some of the central government measures and decrees can not be quickly and effectively implemented at the local level.
此外，国家健康服务体系的混合结构，让中央政府和地区政府都共享一定的控制权，这在疫情爆发初期引起了不少混乱，不同地区卫生当局会采取不同的方法应对疫情，有些甚至与意大利总理孔特的指令相违背。
Moreover, the hybrid structure of the national health-care system, with both central and regional governments sharing some control, led to considerable confusion in the early stages of the outbreak, with health authorities in different regions adopting different approaches to the epidemic, some of which ran counter to Prime Minister Conte's directives.
图 | 意大利警卫队在一个检查站对司机进行核查（来源：CNBC）批评人士指出，意大利政府给民众造成的困惑影响了公民义务呼吁的效果。
Critics of the Italian security forces' verification of drivers at a checkpoint say the confusion inflicted on the population by the Italian government has undermined the effectiveness of calls for civic duty.
关于人们能做什么和能去哪里，政府和北部地区官员给出的信息是相互矛盾的，导致情况愈发糟糕，他们还批评政府像得了精神分裂一样，一会发出警报，要求放下一切以应对疫情，一会说多洗手就可以。
Contradictory information from government and Northern Territory officials about what people can and can do has made matters worse. They also criticize the government for being schizophrenic, issuing warnings to drop everything in response to the outbreak and washing their hands more often.
而关于全国的限行禁令，在官方公布之前意大利媒体提前几个小时走漏了风声，于是上万人搭乘各种交通工具，从即将被封锁的地区逃离，据意大利《24 小时太阳报》3 月 9 日的不完全统计，封锁令生效前一晚从意大利北部封锁区 “逃” 至南部的市民可能多达十万人，监狱甚至因取消亲人探望而导致犯人暴动。
According to incomplete statistics from the Italian 24-hour Sun of 9 March, as many as 100,000 citizens "fled" from the closed areas of northern Italy to the south on the night before the ban went into effect. The prison even led to riots by prisoners who cancelled visits from relatives.
有在意大利的华人媒体表示，发现所谓立即生效的封城令，并没有立即生效。
Chinese media in Italy said the discovery of the so-called immediate ban did not take effect immediately.
3 月 10 日，去马尔本萨和米兰李罗德机场的高速公路拥堵，各个火车站仍然正常运行，米兰中央火车站和 Garibaldi 火车站也都挤满了想逃离的意大利人和游客。
On 10 March, the motorway to Marbenza and Milan's Lyrod airports became congested, railway stations continued to function normally, and Milan's central railway station and Garibaldi train station were full of Italians and tourists who wanted to flee.
图 | 米兰圣维特托雷监狱屋顶上的囚犯抗议：因不满政府防控新冠疫情暂停家属探视，意大利多地至少 27 处监狱发生了暴动，已有 7 名囚犯死亡，20 名囚犯越狱在逃中（来源：Sky News）态度比较散漫的民众疫情的突然暴发和确诊病例的极速增长，与意大利的文化传统、生活习惯也有一定关系。
Prisoner protests on the roof of San Vittori Prison in Milan: Rioting in at least 27 prisons in many parts of Italy, where seven prisoners have died and 20 have escaped, has been linked to Italy's cultural traditions and habits, as has the rapid rise in outbreaks and confirmed cases.
意大利的传统礼仪之下，亲人和朋友见面不仅会拥抱、施贴面礼，还有亲吻面颊的习惯。
In traditional Italian etiquette, family and friends not only embrace, but also kiss on the cheek.
广场文化是意大利一个非常重要的民俗习惯，意大利人有空喜欢到广场上围在一起聊天，而且日常文化生活非常丰富，博物馆、体育赛事、展会，让人们在广场文化外还多了更多聚集的机会，此外意大利旅游业也非常发达。
The square culture is a very important folklore in Italy. Italians like to go to the square to chat together in free time, and everyday cultural life is very rich. Museums, sports events and exhibitions give people more opportunities to gather outside the square culture, and Italian tourism is also very developed.
这都给新冠病毒快速传播创造了条件，就提高输入病例的风险，也扩大了本地传播的可能。
This creates conditions for the rapid spread of the new crown virus, increases the risk of imported cases and increases the likelihood of local transmission.
意大利人重视争取自己的自由，一些小城镇为了防控较早采取 “封城” 举措，但在老百姓反对的情况下就会有一些松动。
Italians value freedom, some small towns to control the early adoption of the "closure" initiative, but in the face of popular opposition there will be some loosening.
据华盛顿邮报等多家外媒报道，在被封锁的意大利各个城镇内，除了城际交通和部分公共场所被封锁外，许多人并没有做到减少外出、在家办公或者是佩戴口罩。
According to many foreign media, including the Washington Post, many people in blockaded Italian towns have not managed to cut back on travel, work from home or wear masks, except for intercity traffic and some public places.
甚至为了反对戴口罩和地区管制措施而毫无保护地进行聚集游行。
There were even unprotected rallies against the wearing of masks and regional controls.
“意大利人尽可能待在家里吧。
"The Italians stay at home as much as possible.
”意大利卫生部长斯佩兰萨的顾问、世界卫生组织执委会成员沃尔特 · 里查尔迪发出提醒。
Walter Richardi, an adviser to Italian Health Minister Speransa and a member of the World Health Organization's Executive Board, sent a reminder.
他说：“病毒不是玩笑！”但至于遵不遵循，只能全凭公民自觉。
He said: "The virus is not a joke!" But as for non-compliance, it can only depend on citizens' consciousness.

Although health authorities are calling for people to stay at home, many people in Italy go out for a weekend party to chat.
据外交部网站消息，3 月 10 日中国国务委员兼外长王毅应约同意大利外长路易吉 · 迪马约（Luigi Di Maio）通电话。
On March 10, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke by telephone with Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio, according to the Foreign Ministry's website.
迪马约表示，当前意大利疫情形势十分严峻，意大利政府正密切关注和学习中方抗疫的成功经验，采取有力举措阻止疫情扩散。
"The current situation in Italy is very serious," he said. "The Italian government is closely following and learning from China's successful experience in fighting the epidemic and taking vigorous measures to stop its spread."
意方面临医疗物资和设备短缺的困难，希中方帮助解决燃眉之急。
Italy faces a shortage of medical supplies and equipment difficulties, hope that China will help meet the immediate needs.
王毅则表示，虽然目前中方自身对医疗物资还有较大需求，但我们将克服困难，向意方提供口罩等医疗物资援助，加大力度向意出口急需的物资和设备。
Wang Yi said that although China still needs medical supplies on its own, we will overcome difficulties by providing medical supplies such as masks to the Italian side and increase our efforts to export urgently needed materials and equipment to Italy.
如意方需要，中方也愿意派出医疗小组赴意协助抗疫。
If desired, China is willing to send medical teams to assist in the fight against the epidemic.
中国同意大利的友好省市和一些企业也将向意方提供支持和帮助。
China and Italy's friendly provinces and cities and a number of enterprises will also provide support and assistance to Italy.
而在意大利将封锁措施扩展至全国后，意大利众议员马泰奥 · 达罗索（Matteo Dall'Osso）——也就是前几天网上火了的戴口罩进议会并发表激烈演讲的议员——对媒体表示，意大利政府在 3 月 9 日宣布的 “封城” 决定很好。
And, following Italy's extension of the embargo across the country, Italian Representative Matteo Dall & amp; Osso - a member of parliament who had entered parliament the other day wearing a mask and delivered a heated speech - told the press that the Italian government's March 9 decision to "close the city" was good.
但是，这项措施对人员流动的限制很大，还包括关闭学校、停办大型活动，对意大利来说实施起来非常困难。
However, this measure imposes significant restrictions on the movement of persons, including the closure of schools and the suspension of major events, which is very difficult for Italy to implement.
达罗索认为，中国对疫情严重地区的限制措施和预防措施都做得很好，意大利必须向中国学习，借鉴经验。
He said China has done a good job of restricting and preventing the spread of the disease. Italy must learn from China and learn from its experience.
他希望，意大利政府出台的 “封城” 法令能朝着正确的方向走，因为这是唯一已经验证过的可以遏制疫情的办法。
He hopes that the Italian government's "blockade" law will go in the right direction, because it is the only proven way to contain the epidemic.
他呼吁意大利民众在共同抗击疫情中形成合力。
He called on the Italian people to work together to fight the epidemic.

Professor Liang Zongan, Director of Respiratory and Critical Medicine at Huaxi Hospital and Permanent Vice-Chairman of the Expert Group on Medical Treatment of Xinguan Pneumonia in Sichuan Province. On March 11, a seven-member team of specialists left for Italy at the request of the Italian Red Cross and reported to the head of JCM.
他们携带相关救援物，支援意大利抗击新冠肺炎疫情。
They carried relief supplies to help Italy fight the outbreak of pneumonia in the New Crown.
问题是，尽管包括中国在内的其他国家会向意大利伸出援手，但帮助规模毕竟有限，很难向意大利提供大规模的支援？尤其是在欧洲已经 “全境沦陷” 的情况下。
The problem is that, while other countries, including China, will come to Italy's aid, the scale of the help is limited, making it difficult to provide large-scale support to Italy, especially now that Europe is "in full swing."
五六天后，意大利如果再新增近万例病人怎么办？不敢想象。
What if, five or six days later, Italy were to add nearly ten thousand new patients?
