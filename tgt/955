澎湃新闻记者 赵思维 发自武汉Play2月6日下午，江汉方舱医院内，一名协和医院的女护士轻声播音一段初来的问候。
Zhao thinking from Wuhan February 6 afternoon, Jiang Han cabin hospital, a Concorde hospital nurses whispered a first greeting.
来源：@武汉发布(01:17)“初来陌生的环境，您可能不太适应，甚至感到紧张或焦虑，我们能够理解。
http: / / www.wuhan / englishcn.com http: / / www.wuhan / englishcn.com "You may not be accustomed to the new environment, you may even feel nervous or anxious, we can understand.
希望大家能跟着音乐的节奏，一起放松自己的身体，平复自己的心情。
Hope everyone can follow the rhythm of music, together with the relaxation of their own bodies, calm their mood.
”2月6日下午，湖北武汉江汉方舱医院内，来自华中科技大学附属协和医院的女护士柔声说道。
"On the afternoon of February 6, a woman nurse from the Concorde Hospital, an affiliate of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, said softly.
华中科技大学附属协和医院护理部副主任、方舱医院心理疏导小组牵头人胡德英说，为缓解患者初到方舱医院的紧张情绪，协和医院在接管江汉方舱医院后，率先在方舱医院引入心理疏导机制，由协和医院心理咨询专家小组进驻。
Hu Deying, deputy director of the nursing department at the Concorde Hospital and head of the psychological guidance group at Fang Cao Hospital, said that after taking over the Jianghan Fangkang Hospital, Concorde Hospital had taken the lead in introducing the psychological guidance mechanism in the Fangkang Hospital, which was attended by a team of mental health experts from Concorde Hospital.
澎湃新闻了解到，在已合计收治超2000名新冠肺炎患者的武昌和江汉两所方舱医院，医护团队在如何安抚患者情绪，进行心理疏导方面交出了一份不错的成绩单。
The newspaper learned that in Wuchang and Jianghan's two cabin hospitals, which had admitted more than 2,000 new cases of pneumonia, the team had produced a good report card on how to calm patients and provide psychological guidance.
成绩单背后，有改善患者养疗环境、开设广播台回应问题知识科普、编印心理手册引导自我疏导等举措，也有医护人员贴心细致服务，用行动阐释方舱设立的意义和医护所做的努力。
Behind the report card are initiatives to improve the environment for patient care, launch radio stations to respond to problems, and produce psychological manuals to guide self-help, as well as intensive medical and nursing staff to explain the significance of the establishment of the cabins and the efforts made by medical staff.
武汉方舱医院内出现越来越多的“跳舞姐”、“做操患者”。
Wuhan square cabin hospital in the emergence of more and more "dancing sister," "do exercise patients."
但不可忽略的是，目前仍然存在患者数量多、专业心理医生数量少等问题。
However, it can not be ignored that there are still a large number of patients, the number of professional psychologists and so on.
武汉大学中南医院高级心理咨询师、湖北省心理咨询师协会会长肖劲松2月10日告诉澎湃新闻，社会心理咨询力量进入方舱进行心理疏导有风险行为，一线医护人员亲身进行心理安抚和患者远程接受减压疏导，是目前比较可行的措施。
A senior counselor at Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital and head of the Hubei Psychological Counsellors Association told surging news on February 10 that psychosocial counseling forces had entered the cabin to conduct psychological counseling and that first-line medical personnel personally offered psychological comfort and patients received remote relief and guidance.
收治近1600名新冠肺炎患者的江汉方舱医院 澎湃新闻记者 赵思维 图病人数量多，专业心理医生数量少2月5日晚，江汉方舱医院、武昌方舱医院接收首批新冠肺炎轻症患者。
Zhao Yintu, a journalist with Penghu Fang Cao Hospital, admitted nearly 1,600 patients with pneumonia. Zhao Yintu, a professional psychiatrist, received the first batch of patients with mild pneumonia on the night of Feb. 5.
此后，有入住的患者因为服务设施、医护配置等问题产生不满情绪，甚至出现患者因不满踢翻垃圾桶、和其他患者深夜吵架的情况出现。
Since then, check-in patients have been dissatisfied with service facilities, health care and other issues, and there have even been cases of patients kicking over rubbish bins and quarrelling with other patients late at night.
南京市心理危机干预中心主任、心理学博士张纯向澎湃新闻解读，人对于未知的恐惧叫“原始恐惧”，陌生的环境、封闭的空间、“死亡”的威胁，会影响到人的情绪。
Zhang Jun, director of the Nanjing Psychological Crisis Intervention Center and a psychologist, explained to the roaring news that people's fear of the unknown is called "primitive fear," that unfamiliar surroundings, closed spaces, and the threat of "death" can affect people's emotions.
这种情绪相互感染，能量累加，就会出现焦虑、焦灼、暴躁的情绪反应，轻则表现不满，重则出现破坏及攻击的行为。
When these emotions infect each other, energy accumulates, and you experience anxiety, anxiety, irritable emotional reactions, low levels of discontent, and destructive and aggressive behaviour.
武昌方舱医院外景澎湃新闻记者 赵思维 图当人们的活动范围小了，社会交往少，自我评价低，又持续生活在一个幽闭狭小的空间里，就极易出现个体的破坏性行为。
Zhao Yintu, a journalist with a high profile outside Wuchang Fangchao Hospital, is prone to individual destructive behavior when people's activities are limited, their social contacts are few, their self-evaluation is low, and they continue to live in a secluded and narrow space.
从心理学的角度说，情绪是压力的溢出效应，压力是情绪的内在动力。
Psychologically speaking, emotions are the spillover effects of stress, which is the intrinsic motivation of emotions.
如果个体情绪找不到“攻击的靶标”，就会出现心理学意义上的“代偿行为”，这就是这类“方舱效应”的心理动力。
If an individual's emotions do not find a "target for attack," there will be psychological "compensatory behavior," which is the psychological driving force behind this "cockpit effect."
武汉大学中南医院高级心理咨询师、湖北省心理咨询师协会会长肖劲松和他的团队自武汉“封城”之日起，就一直利用专业所长为市民和医护提供心理方面的帮扶。
Since Wuhan "closed the city," Xiao Jingsong, a senior psychologist at Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital and president of the Hubei Psychological Association, and his team have been using their expertise to provide psychological support to the public and medical care.
他认为，方舱医院的患者症状都较轻，他们面对的除了专业的诊疗护理方面问题外，还有室内温度、饭菜质量等生活方面的问题，“实际是后勤保障这种生活管理背后的心理管理，需要心理介入。
In his opinion, the patients in Fang Cao Hospital had mild symptoms, and they faced not only professional medical and nursing problems, but also life-long problems such as indoor temperature and food quality.
”但是这种心理介入又和以前地震这类灾区心理救援的情况不一样，患者住院期间，社会的心理咨询师进入医院，一是没有这个资质，二是也会把他们陷入一种危险的境地，因为他们也没有受过专业培训。
But the psychological intervention is not the same as in previous quake-hit areas, where social counsellors enter hospitals without qualifications and put them at risk because they have no professional training.
肖劲松认为，在患者数量多，专业心理医生数量少，这样目前一个的失衡局面下，排除社会心理咨询力量后，一线医护人员亲身心理安抚和患者远程接受减压疏导成为目前比较可行的措施。
Xiao Jinsong believes that in the number of patients, a small number of professional psychologists, so that the current imbalance of a situation, excluding psychosocial counselling, the first-line health-care personnel personally psychological relief and patients remote relief become more feasible measures.
他解释，进入方舱医院的医护人员上学时都学过心理学，只不过大部分毕业后没有做这方面的工作。
He explained that the paramedics who entered the cabin hospital had studied psychology when they went to school, although most of them did not do so after graduation.
由专业团队对医护人员做简单培训，让他们成为一个非专业的心理工作者，可以做一些心理安抚工作。
Medical staff should be trained by a professional team to become a non-professional psychological worker, and can do some psychological work.
“如果有专业团队做培训，就做培训；如果没有，就可以求助于社会力量做培训。
"If there is a professional team doing the training, do it; if not, you can turn to social forces for training.
”在对新冠肺炎患者和医护心理疏导多日后，肖劲松团队编写了“新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情心理干预手册”。
After days of psychological counseling for patients with Newly Coronavirus infection, Xiao Jinsong's team wrote a manual for psychological intervention in treating pneumonia due to a new coronavirus infection.
该手册从确诊患者、疑似患者、医护及相关人员、与患者密切接触者的干预、有发热但不愿公开就医人群的干预等群体的心理干预和减压措施进行了详细说明。
The manual details psychological interventions and stress-reduction measures for groups such as diagnosed patients, suspected patients, medical and related personnel, interventions by those in close contact with patients, and those with fever who do not wish to seek public access to health care.
按照该手册，确诊、进行隔离治疗的患者的心理症状一般为麻木、愤怒、恐惧、抑郁、孤独，或因对疾病的恐惧而不配合、放弃治疗等。
According to the manual, patients diagnosed and treated in isolation generally suffer from numbness, anger, fear, depression, loneliness, or lack of cooperation due to fear of illness, abandonment of treatment, etc.
在这种情况下，要采取根据患者所能接受的程度，客观如实交代病情和外界疫情，使患者做到心中有数；协助与外界亲人沟通，转达信息，建立社会支持系统；积极鼓励患者配合治疗；帮助反映问题，尽量协助改善患者就医环境等措施。
In such cases, the patient must be informed objectively and truthfully to the extent acceptable to the patient; facilitate communication with the outside family, convey information and establish a social support system; actively encourage patients to cooperate with treatment; help to report problems; and help to improve the patient's access to health care as much as possible.
武昌方舱医院内的患者手持《走进方舱》心理手册 受访者供图编印心理手册，医护用行动缓和患者情绪武昌方舱医院是此次首批三处改造启用的方舱医院之一，计划容纳800张病床。
The patient in Wuchang Fang Cathedral Hospital held the psychological handbook Walking Into the Cabin. The interviewee provided a psychological booklet. Medical Action to Ease Patient's Emotions Wuchang Fang Cathedral Hospital was one of the first three converted cabin hospitals with a planned capacity of 800 beds.
2月5日晚正式收治第一批患者以来，截至2月10日上午8点，已收治467名新冠肺炎轻症患者。
As of 8 a.m. on 10 February, 467 patients with mild pneumonia had been admitted since the first group of patients was officially admitted on the evening of 5 February.
武汉大学人民医院副院长、武昌方舱医院负责人万军2月10日告诉澎湃新闻，针对患者反映的心理方面的问题，一方面是动态改善病人的养疗环境，提高患者的取暖和伙食标准。
The Vice-President of Wuhan University People's Hospital and the director of Wuchang Fangkang Hospital told the roar news on February 10 that the psychological problems reported by patients were on the one hand the dynamic improvement of the patient's therapeutic environment and the improvement of the heating and catering standards of patients.
另一方面，通过设立院内广播台、编印《走进方舱》心理疏导手册、成立病友党总支等形式及时解答大家的问题，避免出现情绪恐慌，进行心理疏导。
On the other hand, through the establishment of hospital radio stations, the "into the cabin" psychological guidance manual, the establishment of the general branch of the sick friends, and other forms of timely answers to everyone's questions, avoid emotional panic, psychological counseling.
此外，一线的医护人员也通过自身贴心周到的服务来做“无声”的心理疏导。
In addition, front-line health care workers through their own thoughtful service to do "silent" psychological counseling.
万军说，来支援武汉的医护人员大部分来自外省，很多人都是90、95后，虽然经过了简单的培训，但是对于传染病的知识不是很够。
Most of the medical staff who came to support Wuhan came from other provinces, and many of them were 90 or 95 years later. Although they had received some simple training, their knowledge of infectious diseases was inadequate.
供暖，对于患者来说舒服，但是对于穿着防护服的医护人员感受恶劣。
Heating is comfortable for patients, but bad for health care workers in protective clothing.
高湿度、高温度的环境，对体力消耗非常大，但没有一个人叫苦叫累，有的累倒了起来还继续坚持工作。
High humidity, high temperature environment, physical energy consumption is very large, but no one cried tired, some tired up and continue to work.
这种非常专业、信心、耐心，忘我地为病人服务精神其实也感染着每一个患者，患者也就能够换位思考，情绪缓好很多，出现了很多跳舞做操的患者。
This very professional, confident, patient, selfless service to the patient spirit is actually infected with every patient, patients can also change their thinking, mood much better, there are a lot of dance to do the patients.
万军所提到的《走进方舱》手册是由援助武汉、入驻武昌方舱医院提供诊疗服务的中南大学湘雅二医院医护团队，根据方舱医院的特点和患者的常见问题编印下发。
The brochure "Walking into the Cabin" mentioned by Almighty is produced and distributed by the medical team of Xiangya II Hospital of Zhongnan University, which assists Wuhan, which is admitted to Wuchang Fangcao Hospital to provide clinical services.
澎湃新闻查阅发现，该手册从如何做好个人防护到出院标准的解答，从压力下心理反应识别、如何调节焦虑情绪到呼吸放松、积极暗示、室内锻炼方法等技术介绍，试图教会患者在方舱医院治疗期间，如何建立心理防线，战胜疾病。
The manual, which covers everything from personal protection to answers to discharge criteria, from stress recognition to stress management to relaxation, positive cues and indoor exercise, tries to teach patients how to build a psychological line of defense and fight disease during treatment in a cabin hospital.
湘雅二医院相关负责人告诉澎湃新闻，在入驻武昌方舱医院后，看到新冠肺炎形势严峻，帮助患者克服心中的恐慌和不安已是当务之急，便紧急动员院内精神科负责人编写了该册子，并在2月7日晚上加急印刷1000册，发放至每位患者手中。
The relevant officials of Xiangya II Hospital told Peng Pai News that after entering the hospital in Wuchang, seeing that the situation of the new crown pneumonia was serious and helping the patients overcome their panic and uneasiness, the hospital psychiatrist prepared the booklet, and on the night of February 7, 1000 copies of the booklet were urgently printed and distributed to each patient.
“一方面是帮助患者减压，另一方面，也为医务人员对患者心理问题的识别和疏导工作提供科学指导，保证救治工作科学化、合理化、精准施策。
"On the one hand, it helps patients relieve stress, on the other hand, it also provides scientific guidance for medical staff in identifying and mediating patients' psychological problems, and ensures scientific, rational and accurate treatment.
”江汉方舱医院内开设的广播台 受访者供图开设院内广播，出现多个“跳舞姐”另一边，收治近1600名患者的江汉方舱医院也在寻求建立医患沟通渠道，对患者开展心理疏导工作。
The respondents of the radio station set up in the Jiang-Han cabin hospital offered plans to open hospital broadcasts. On the other side of the hospital, a group of "dancing sisters" appeared.
江汉方舱医院护士给患者提供的书籍受访者供图华中科技大学附属协和医院党委副书记、江汉方舱医院负责人孙晖2月9日晚告诉澎湃新闻，目前在院内已经开展包括成立包含患者的党支部，号召患者自助性社会服务；开设院内广播台，回答问题科普知识；成立心理疏导组，到一线与患者沟通；建立读书角等举措。
In the evening of February 9, Sun Fai, deputy secretary of the Party committee attached to the Concorde Hospital of the Central University of Science and Technology and head of the Jianghan Fangcao Hospital told Peng Pai News on the evening of February 9.
“昨天（8日）我们就针对卫生间堵的问题，在广播中提到要爱护自己的环境，今天情况就要好一些了。
"Yesterday (8th) we talked about caring for our environment on the radio about the clog in the toilet. Today things will be better.
”孙晖说。
"said Sun.
华中科技大学附属协和医院护理部副主任、方舱医院心理疏导小组牵头人胡德英说，为缓解患者初到方舱医院的紧张情绪，协和医院在接管江汉方舱医院后，率先在方舱医院引入心理疏导机制，由协和医院心理咨询专家小组进驻。
Hu Deying, deputy director of the nursing department at the Concorde Hospital and head of the psychological guidance group at Fang Cao Hospital, said that after taking over the Jianghan Fangkang Hospital, Concorde Hospital had taken the lead in introducing the psychological guidance mechanism in the Fangkang Hospital, which was attended by a team of mental health experts from Concorde Hospital.
方舱内，专业的心理疏导还是由心理咨询室的老师负责，他们单独建立了一个协和医院的护士心理疏导群，还有患者热线，开通了线上咨询。
In the square cabin, professional psychological counseling is still the responsibility of the psychological consultation room teachers, they set up a separate Concorde Hospital nurses psychological counseling group, as well as the patients hotline, opened online counselling.
而咨询值班的、广播值班的都是心理疏导志愿者，大家都是在自己闲暇时间值班，志愿者也都拿了心理咨询师证书。
And the consultation duty, the broadcast duty are the psychological counseling volunteers, everyone is on duty in their leisure time, volunteers also took the psychological consultant certificate.
“一些人是基本上没上班但是志愿去的，已经去了两天，后面会排班。
"Some people are basically absent from work but volunteer, have been gone for two days and will be scheduled later.
”胡德英建议，在志愿者护士当中，选派一定比例是心理咨询师的护士，这样可以对患者提供身心方面的护理，是一个很完整的优质护理过程。
Among volunteer nurses, Ms. Hu suggests assigning nurses with a certain proportion of counselors to provide physical and psychological care and a complete quality of care.
广播作为一种大众传播媒介，在方舱内发挥沟通作用。
As a mass media, broadcasting plays a communication role in the square cabin.
澎湃新闻获得的一段江汉方舱医院内部广播台播音视频显示，2月6日下午，一名协和医院的女护士轻声播音一段初来的问候，“初来陌生的环境，您可能不太适应，甚至感到紧张或焦虑，我们能够理解。
On the afternoon of February 6, a woman nurse from Concorde Hospital whispered a first-time greeting, "You may not adapt to the new environment, you may even feel tense or anxious, we can understand.
”广播最后放了一段轻音乐，“希望大家能跟着音乐的节奏，一起放松自己的身体，平复自己的心情。
"The broadcast concluded with a little music." I hope we can relax ourselves and calm down to the rhythm of the music.
”2月8日下午，广播台再次传来柔和的声音。
On the afternoon of February 8, a soft voice came again from the radio.
“这里是江汉方舱医院广播台，我是协和医院的医务人员小婧。
This is the radio station of Jianghan Fangkang Hospital. I am a doctor at Concorde Hospital.
元宵佳节本该和家人一起团团圆圆给过年画上句号，但新冠肺炎的肆虐，让我们经历一个平凡的节日……”胡德英告诉澎湃新闻，广播主要通过病房的护士把病人的意见收集，然后把大家关心的问题在广播里进行解答。
The Lantern Festival should have ended with the family, but the New Year's Eve Pneumonia, let us experience an ordinary festival... "Hu told the roar news, the radio mainly through the nurses in the ward of patients, and then everyone's concerns on the radio to answer.
现在广播是一天早中晚播三次，结束时播放轻音乐。
Now the radio is broadcast three times a day in the morning and at the end of the day plays light music.
“我们（在来之后的）第二天的时候唱了《我和我的祖国》，大伙儿都很重视，我们倡导患者如果体力可以的话带上口罩跟我们一起唱。
"We sang" Me and My Motherland "the next day (after our arrival), and we all took seriously the idea of patients wearing masks to sing with us if they were physically fit.
”从效果看，现在患者情绪比之前来的时候好很多，网上比较火的“读书哥”、“跳舞姐”就是一个真实写照，每天护士都会抽时间带着大家做些运动。
In effect, patients are now in a much better mood than when they came before, and the popular online "brother-in-law" and "dancing sister" are a real picture, with nurses taking time out every day to exercise.
胡德英向澎湃新闻介绍，方舱内患者为新冠肺炎的轻症患者，生活能自理，平时休养比较苦闷，做操和跳舞正好可以缓解心情，反响较好。
Hu told the roaring news that the patient in the square cabin is a mild case of pneumonia, living on his own, usually more painful rest, do exercises and dancing can just ease the mood, the response is better.
网友担心的吵到其他人等问题，因为频次也不是很高，目前并未收到相关投诉。
The netizens worried about noisy other people and other issues, because the frequency is not very high, no complaints have been received.
江汉方舱医院内的“跳舞姐”受访者供图2月9日，澎湃新闻联系到拍摄“跳舞姐”的江汉方舱医院患者何女士，她于5日确诊感染新冠病毒，6日入住位于武汉国际会展中心的方舱医院。
A dancing sister was admitted to the Hong Kong International Convention and Exhibition Centre on February 9, 2007. Ms. He, who was diagnosed with the new crown virus, was admitted to the Wuhan International Convention and Exhibition Centre on February 9.
入住第二天，她拍下了患者跳舞的视频。
The next day of occupancy, she took a video of the patient dancing.
相比一些患者出现焦虑情绪，何女士显得十分乐观。
Compared to some patients with anxiety, Ms He appears very optimistic.
来到方舱医院后，她没有因入住条件有限而抱怨，反而是每天更积极去面对生活，看到有患者在跳舞，她也会加入进去一起舞蹈。
Instead of complaining about her limited occupancy, she went out to live more actively every day, and when she saw the patients dancing, she would join in the dance.
她常常在朋友圈里晒出自己的一日三餐，怀着感恩的心去面对帮助过她的医护人员。
She used to bathe her meals three times a day in a circle of friends, facing with gratitude the medical staff who had helped her.
“希望大家都能少一点抱怨，多一点理解。
"I hope we can all complain less and understand more.
