澎湃新闻记者 陈斯斯“‘我是不是感染了新冠肺炎？’这个是线上问诊出镜率最高的问题。
The journalist Chen Si, "Am I infected with pneumonia?" This is on-line consultation rate of the highest rate of problems.
”2月17日，上海市同济医院精神医学科医生刘飞这样告诉澎湃新闻记者。
Liu Fei, a psychiatrist at Shanghai Tongji Hospital, told reporters on Feb. 17.
这些天，同济医院接到了大量的网络、电话和门诊等线上和线下的求助和求诊，有人因疫情失眠，有情绪早已稳定的焦虑症患者又现情绪波动。
These days, Tongji Hospital received a large number of online and offline help and treatment, such as network, telephone and outpatient, some insomnia due to the emotional stability of anxiety patients have been fluctuating.
疫情不断攀升的数字牵动人心，疫情带来的担忧、恐慌、焦虑情绪如何解？管住手，不要时时捏着手机刘飞指出，最近有调查显示，近80%的民众非常关注疫情进展，其中仅少数人保持乐观，大多数有强烈的担忧和恐惧，不乏认为自己很可能感染“新冠”肺炎的人。
(Liu Fei) A recent survey shows that nearly 80 percent of the population is very concerned about the epidemic, with only a few remaining optimistic, most of them deeply worried and fearful, and many believing they are at high risk of contracting the disease.
对此，他认为，新冠肺炎疫情爆发，市民们开始了“家里蹲”模式，刷屏疫情报道成了生活中的重点，疫情的一切消息，无论真假，大多数市民都选择宁可信其有，继而投入了过多的注意力关注疫情。
In this regard, he believes that the outbreak of pneumonia, citizens began to "squat" mode, screen coverage has become the focus of life, all the news, whether true or false, the majority of the public chose to trust it, and then invested too much attention in the epidemic.
“由于大多数新冠肺炎的患病表现并不严重，也不算特别明显，不少市民偶有干咳，打喷嚏，口干咽痛的情况，就开始怀疑起自己是否被感染。
"Since most cases of new crown pneumonia do not appear to be serious or particularly severe, many people have occasional dry coughing, sneezing and sore throat and begin to wonder if they are infected.
”这种情况到底正常吗？刘飞解释说，其实心理学认为，在灾难面前出现恐惧和焦虑是正常的应激反应，会带来心悸、气急、易怒、烦躁不安、周身不适，甚至情绪失控等问题。
In fact, psychology believes that fear and anxiety in the face of a disaster are normal stressors, causing palpitations, shortness of breath, irritability, restlessness, general discomfort and even loss of control, Liu explained.
一个比较简单的识别方法，就是首先排查我们身边是否有更明确的诱因导致了不适，例如空气不够流通或饮水不足等，然后想想自己在注意力集中于某件事时，是否也有明显的不适症状，进而推断自己是不是过度紧张焦虑了。
A relatively simple way to identify is to first examine whether there are any more specific causes of discomfort, such as insufficient air circulation or inadequate drinking water, around us, and then think about whether you have obvious symptoms of discomfort when you are concentrating on something, and then infer whether you are over-stressed or anxious.
此前，中科院专家也公开发布建议：要稳定情绪，仔细观察症状与新冠肺炎是否符合，身体不适正常就诊；控制行为，转移注意力，有“疑病状态”要认真对待，可以主动寻求心理援助。
Earlier, Chinese Academy of Sciences experts have publicly issued recommendations: to stabilize the mood, carefully observe the symptoms and the new crown pneumonia, the body is not normal clinic; control behavior, diverting attention, "suspicious state" to take seriously, can actively seek psychological assistance.
除了线上咨询，在线下门诊中，刘飞最近也发现有许多配药的患者提到睡眠出了问题，尽管不少患者的回答是否定的。
In addition to online consultations, Liu recently found that many prescription patients mentioned sleeping problems, although many answered in the negative.
但深究其原因就会发现，患者失眠的主因在于新冠肺炎疫情爆发后，不能外出，躺着刷屏时间变长，作息规律打乱。
However, the cause of insomnia will find that the main reason for the outbreak of pneumonia in the new crown pneumonia, can not go out, lying on the screen longer, disruption of routine.
“这种情况下，我们建议没必要立刻用药，或急于增加原来的改善睡眠药物的剂量，而应以改变生活方式和调节作息为主。
"In this case, we do not recommend immediate medication, or a rush to increase the amount of sleep medications, but should focus on lifestyle changes and lifestyle changes.
足不出户的时候，我们要管住手，不要时时捏着手机，一定控制刷屏的时间。
Do not leave the house, we should control the hand, do not always hold the mobile phone, must control the screen time.
”刘飞进一步表示，最近武汉方舱医院里不少轻症新冠肺炎患者就是榜样，面对身患新冠肺炎的事实，他们却选择用乐观积极的状态应对，如自发组织跳广场舞，借阅书籍学习，还有的谈起了恋爱，甚至也在方舱内的双方父母都见了面。
"In the face of the new crown pneumonia, Wuhan Fang Cao Hospital recently set an example by choosing to deal with it in an optimistic and positive way, such as organising dance squares, borrowing books and learning, talking about falling in love and even meeting the parents of both sides of the cabin.
家人要增加对老人的陪伴刘飞也提到，除了睡眠问题，在门诊中还有一部分有过焦虑症、抑郁症的患者，他们的情绪波动较大，“例如有一位老年女性曾患焦虑症，经系统治疗后治愈，近十年未服药都保持着情绪稳定，但一周前因为担心病毒感染，出现紧张、焦虑的情况。
"For example, an elderly woman who has suffered from anxiety disorder and has been cured by systemic treatment and has not taken drugs for nearly a decade has remained emotionally stable, but a week ago she was nervous and anxious because of a viral infection.
还有的患者因为在疫情期间患上普通感冒，过度担心，引发焦虑，难以自我调节，已经停药的他们也不得不再次治疗。
Others suffer from the common cold during the epidemic, worry too much, cause anxiety, have trouble regulating themselves, and have to be treated again if they have stopped taking the drug.
”“特殊时期，针对患者病情的变化，我们会以个体化调整为原则，重视人文和环境因素，重视心理调整，探讨生活方式调整，并非所有出现焦虑抑郁病情波动的患者都会增加药量或再次开始服药。
"In special periods, we will adopt individualized adjustment as a principle, attach importance to humanistic and environmental factors, attach importance to psychological adjustment, and explore lifestyle adjustments.
”刘飞举例说，他在接诊过程中遇到一位老年抑郁症患者，已经服用足够剂量的两种抗抑郁药，处于情绪稳定期，最近出现心情差，有悲观情绪，认为疫情越来越严重看不到希望。
"For example, Liu said he encountered an elderly depressive patient during treatment who had already taken two antidepressants in sufficient doses, was in a period of emotional stability and had recently experienced mood swings, pessimism and a growing sense of hopelessness.
问其原因，才发现是陪伴她的保姆由于被隔离在了老家，无法返沪，孤独导致其病情波动。
Asking the reason, only to find that is accompanied by her baby-sitter due to isolation in her hometown, unable to return to Shanghai, lonely caused his condition fluctuate.
“在这个时候，子女等家人增加对老人的陪伴，打消其孤独感才是解决问题的关键。
"At this point, the key to solving the problem is for families to increase their companionship and eliminate their sense of isolation.
”刘飞解释说。
"said Liu.
当前，不论是首诊还是复诊，人们常常都有这样的疑虑，万一去医院看病，没病却被感染了岂不是倒霉了，尤其不少患者打听到自己就诊的医院已有确诊病例，索性就拖延或者断药。
At present, whether at first or second visit, people often have the doubt that in case of going to the hospital, it would be unfortunate if they were infected, especially since many patients find out that they have a confirmed case in the hospital where they see the patient and simply delay or stop taking the medicine.
刘飞建议，任何情况下延误或中断本身的治疗都是不可取的。
Liu suggested that it was not advisable to delay or interrupt treatment under any circumstances.
疫情形势严峻，有担心、疑虑是正常的，但科学防护才是硬道理，担心并不能解决任何问题，反而会造成不良后果。
The situation of the epidemic is serious. It is normal to have fears and doubts, but scientific protection is the absolute truth.
作为个人，应该牢记防范原则，提高防护水平。
As individuals, the precautionary principle should be borne in mind and the level of protection increased.
疫情爆发以来，各大医院都已启动应急预案，将病毒院内传播的风险降到了最低。
Since the outbreak, major hospitals have launched emergency plans to minimize the risk of transmission in the hospital.
“以上海市同济医院为例，从进入医院时的体温筛查，到门诊限流，再到消毒防疫，每一个环节都在保障就诊患者和医务人员的安全。
"Taking Tongji Hospital in Shanghai as an example, the safety of patients and medical staff is guaranteed at every step, from the screening of body temperature when entering the hospital to the restriction of flow in the outpatient clinic, to disinfection and prevention.
要坚定信心，科学防控，精准治疗，我们终会战胜疫情，及时就诊，情绪问题也会早日得到解决。
To strengthen confidence, scientific control, precision treatment, we will eventually overcome the epidemic, timely medical attention, emotional problems will be resolved as soon as possible.
”刘飞说。
