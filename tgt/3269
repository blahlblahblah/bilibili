从我落地北京打开国内手机的那刻起，工作人员就和我电话联络，时刻关注我们的健康状况和与疾控工作人员对接的情况。
From the moment I landed in Beijing to open a domestic cell phone, the staff contacted me by phone, keeping an eye on our health and docking with the CDC staff.
口述 | 阿　楠整理 |应　琛学校通知我们3月16日开学，先上两周的网课，然后根据新冠肺炎疫情再做决定。
AT & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45
这样一算，我好像真的要在宾馆上网课了，值得庆幸的是在这里的网速还不错。
Such a calculation, I really seem to be in the hotel online classes, is fortunate that the speed of the Internet here is not bad.
从3月7日被送到这个集中隔离点算起，今天（3月11日）是我从韩国回到宁夏银川后被隔离的第五天，每天都要测三次体温。
I was quarantined today (March 11), the fifth day of isolation since my return to Yinchuan from South Korea. I had my temperature taken three times a day.
刚到韩国，当地疫情就暴发了我是一名在韩国留学的中国学生，去年12月25日回到老家，最初那几天还挺开心的，去见了家里的亲戚和朋友。
I was a Chinese student studying in South Korea. I returned to my hometown on December 25 and had a good time in the first few days.
但没过多久就从新闻里看到了武汉出现不明原因的肺炎，一开始没有那么恐慌，接着传出武汉封城的消息，我和家人意识到情况变严重了。
But it wasn't long before the news of an unexplained pneumonia in Wuhan, not so panicky at first, and then the news that Wuhan had been closed to the public made me and my family aware that the situation was getting worse.
相对来说银川距离重点疫情地区远，加上当地本来人口流动就比较少，疫情并不是很严重。
Relatively far from key epidemic areas, Yinchuan, coupled with the local original population movement is relatively small, the epidemic is not very serious.
但整个春节期间，出于安全起见，我和家人基本待在家里，没怎么出过门。
But throughout the Spring Festival, for security reasons, my family and I stayed at home, not much out of the house.
回国时，我买的是往返机票，计划2月26日飞回首尔。
When I returned home, I bought a round-trip ticket and planned to fly back on February 26.
后来，国内的疫情越来越严重，2月初，航空公司忽然发短信通知，说我原定的航班取消了。
Then, as the epidemic got worse in China, the airline suddenly sent a text message in early February announcing that my scheduled flight had been cancelled.
当时，我学校通知3月2日开学计划不变，且韩国的确诊病例确实也很少。
At the time, my school told me that our plans for the start of school on March 2 remained unchanged, and confirmed cases in South Korea were rare.
我和一起回来的两个老乡同学商量后决定早点回韩国，因为不知道接下来国内疫情发展如何，万一后面韩国限制入境就麻烦了。
After discussing with two fellow townspeople who came back together, I decided to return to Korea earlier, because I don't know how the epidemic will develop in the future.
我们谁都不想放弃学业，休学面临的是金钱和时间的双重损失。
None of us want to give up our studies. What we face is a double loss of money and time.
那个时候国内国外多趟航班取消，航空公司的热线打几次都是占线，改签的过程非常艰难，我一开始是工作日的白天打，开着免提等人工客服，2个多小时没人接听。
At that time, many domestic and foreign flights were canceled, the airline hotline was busy several times, the process of re-signing is very difficult, I started the day on the workday, driving hands-free and other manual customer service, more than two hours no one answered.
后来，我凌晨两三点打，即便如此也要等40分钟左右。
Later, I fought two or three in the morning, and even then I had to wait about 40 minutes.
最终，我们买到了2月19日经上海飞首尔的航班。
In the end, we got a flight to Seoul via Shanghai on February 19th.
由于航班大量减少，到了上海之后，航空公司安排我们住了一晚酒店，第二天才能飞首尔。
Due to the large number of flights, after arriving in Shanghai, the airline arranged for us to stay in a hotel for one night before flying to Seoul the next day.
整个出行过程，我和朋友们除了戴着口罩，还把浴帽也戴上了。
Throughout the trip, my friends and I wore bathrobe as well as masks.
买到机票的那刻，我们暗自庆幸。
We hugged ourselves at the moment we got our tickets.
但到了韩国后，我们完全傻了眼。
But when we got to South Korea, we were completely dumbfounded.
2月19日起，韩国开始出现聚集性的确诊病例，并在我们到达那天开始暴发。
Starting on February 19, there were confirmed cases of agglomeration in South Korea, which began on the day of our arrival.
最初报道中，韩国官方并没有很重视，只是寥寥几笔。
In the initial report, South Korean officials did not pay much attention, just a few.
如果能提前知道，我们也就留在老家不走了。
If we had known in advance, we would have stayed in our hometown.
首尔机场入境排队紧张的气氛从入境的那刻就开始了，除了要多填一张“感染申告书”之外，每个人还要下载一个APP，每天申报自己的健康状况，机场特别开辟了一个“自华旅客专用”通道，印象里这是等待时间最漫长的一次入境。
In addition to filling out an "infection declaration," everyone has to download an APP to declare their health every day. The airport has opened a "private" passage for visitors from China, giving the impression that this is the longest waiting period.
左一是多填的感染申告书我们住的地方附近大概有10多家药店。
On the left is a multi-filled declaration of infection. We live near about a dozen pharmacies.
放完行李，我们三人就打算去买一些口罩和酒精备着，但口罩已经买不到了，买到的酒精也是附近区域最后的两瓶。
After packing, the three of us were going to buy some masks and alcohol, but the masks were not available and the alcohol was the last two bottles in the neighborhood.
最后两瓶酒精和家里的手部消毒液至于最关键的口罩还是第二天我们去明洞换钱时，在附近的药妆店买到的。
The last two bottles of alcohol and the hand sanitizer at home. As for the most critical mask, we bought it the next day at the local dresser's shop when we went to the cave to change money.
原本500-1000韩元一个的KF94口罩已经涨价到了近3000韩元（18元人民币）。
The price of KF94 masks, originally 500-1000 won, has risen to nearly 3,000 won (18 yuan).
当时还能买到的KF94口罩慢慢地，我们感受到韩国疫情的日益严重。
The KF94 mask was still available at the time, and we felt the growing severity of the epidemic in South Korea.
我就读的学校通知延迟到3月16日开学。
My school notice was delayed until the beginning of school on 16 March.
原本学校规定，所有留学生到韩国后一定要本人去学校报道并交表，但因为学校在离首尔七八十公里远的另一个城市，于我而言，我来自中国应该要尽量少出门；另一方面，我对韩国当地不消毒公共交通和大量国民不戴口罩的现象也非常恐慌，考虑到路上有感染风险，学校老师最终同意我们开学后再去补交。
But because the school is in another city 70 kilometers away from Seoul, I should travel as little as possible from China. On the other hand, I am very worried about the lack of disinfectant public transportation and the large number of people who don't wear masks.
2月25日，某emart的口罩购买券已发放完毕，但仍有消费者在现场聚集　图｜韩国网站眼瞅着离开学还有20多天，我们在网上买了一些食物储备，当晚就配送到了。
On February 25, some emart tickets for the purchase of masks were distributed, but some consumers gathered at the scene, less than 20 days before we left school. We bought some food stocks online and delivered them that evening.
但两天后，我们想要再次网购食物时，发现前一秒还有货的东西下一秒就售罄了，连配送的时间也只能预约到两天后。
But two days later, when we wanted to shop online again, we found that everything we had was sold out the next second and we could only book an appointment for two days later.
2月20日到韩国当天，地铁上还有不戴口罩的年轻人路上不戴口罩的人，从我们落地那天的50%以上，慢慢变成了只有10%左右。
On the day of Feb. 20, there were more than 50% of mask-free road users on the subway, slowly changing to about 10% from over 50% on the day we landed.
其间，我朋友有一天忘记在APP上申报，立马就收到了短信提醒：“如不按时申报，将面临100万韩元的处罚”。
In the meantime, my friend forgot to declare on the APP one day and was immediately alerted by a text message: "Failure to file on time will result in a penalty of one million won."
此外，每天手机还会收到七八条关于疫情的消息。
In addition, the mobile phone every day will also receive 78 information about the epidemic.
自动发送的疫情提醒短信登机口体温过高，我是最后一个登机的真正促使我们下定决心回国的有两件事——一件是韩国的某个确诊病例去过我们平时买菜的超市；另一件是，3月2日新闻说每周大约会减少100个往返中韩的航班，紧接着又出现由于大规模停飞，韩国回青岛的经济舱机票涨价到了3000多元。
I was one of the last two things that really motivated us to go home - a confirmed case in South Korea who went to a supermarket where we normally buy food, and the March 2 news that about 100 flights a week to and from China followed by an economy-class fare increase to more than 3,000 as a result of mass stoppages.
防疫人员经过医院门口　图｜韩联社当时，我们搜了一下回银川的机票，才1000多元，没涨价太多。
epidemic prevention personnel after the hospital entrance picture, we searched back Yinchuan tickets, just 1000 yuan, did not increase prices too much.
抱着大不了改签或者损失几百元的想法，我们三个人定了3月7日飞北京转机回银川的机票。
The three of us have booked a flight back to Yinchuan from Beijing on March 7 with the idea of a major change or loss of a few hundred yuan.
之后航空公司通知我们原定航班取消，但也因此帮我们改到了前一天同一时间的航班。
The airline then informed us that the scheduled flight was cancelled, but it also helped us to change our flight to the same time the day before.
因为不是联程航班，两个航班间的中转时间只有不到两个小时，我们特意没有托运行李。
As it was not a connecting flight and the transit time between the two flights was less than two hours, we specifically did not check-in luggage.
但那天还是排队和飞奔中度过的。
But that day was spent in line and at a gallop.
北京机场入关虽然旅客不算最多，入关时还专门辟了外交礼遇通道给我们境外回国的人员走，但入关的检验检疫非常严格，光测温就测了三次。
Although not the largest number of passengers, when entering the customs, we also set up a special diplomatic courtesy passage for people returning from abroad, but the entry inspection and quarantine is very strict, the light temperature measurement was taken three times.
我瞥见角落的移动隔离点已经有一个戴着口罩的人。
I glimpsed a man wearing a mask at the moving quarantine point in the corner.
转机时，边检人员问得特别仔细，安检时，工作人员把包里所有的液体都拿了出来，一件件问是什么，还要打开闻一下再次确认。
When the transfer, the border inspectors asked very carefully, security check, the staff took out all the liquid in the bag, one by one asked what it is, but also opened a sniff to reconfirm.
离飞机起飞还剩15分钟时，我们才赶到登机口。
We arrived at the gate 15 minutes before the plane took off.
因为一路狂奔，地勤给我测了几次体温都显示偏高。
As I ran along the road, the ground floor took a few temperature tests and showed a high temperature.
她让我赶紧想办法降温，不然不让我登机。
She told me to try to cool down quickly or I would not be allowed on board.
而我的两个朋友已经登机了。
And two of my friends have already boarded the plane.
我当时急得满头大汗，把包往地上一扔就开始脱外套，然后拼命扇风。
I was sweating so much that I threw my bag on the ground and began to take off my coat.
还剩3分钟时，体温总算正常了，我是全机最后一个登机的。
With three minutes to go, my temperature was fine and I was the last one on the plane.
从机场被直接送去集中隔离事实上，买好机票的那天，我们就告诉了家里人要回来的消息，家里又向社区和派出所报备了。
We were taken directly from the airport to be quarantined In fact, on the day the plane ticket was purchased, we told our family that we wanted to come back, and the family reported it to the community and the police station.
社区和派出所对境外回来的人员高度重视，每天会跟我家里人通电话，了解我的情况。
The community and police stations attach great importance to the people who come back from abroad and will call my family every day to find out about me.
从我落地北京打开国内手机的那刻起，工作人员就和我电话联络，时刻关注我们的健康状况和与疾控工作人员对接的情况。
From the moment I landed in Beijing to open a domestic cell phone, the staff contacted me by phone, keeping an eye on our health and docking with the CDC staff.
Play银川机场隔离区飞机还没落地，银川疾控部门的人就已经穿着隔离服在机场出口等着我们了。
Play Yinchuan Airport area of separation aircraft has not landed, Yinchuan Department of Disease Control has been wearing isolation clothing waiting for us at the airport exit.
他们先让我们在机场的隔离区稍作等待，我们仨和另外两个韩国回来的人，以及一个德国回来的人一起被送到了指定隔离点。
They told us to wait in the quarantine area of the airport for a while, and the three of us, together with two other South Korean returnees and a German man, were taken to a designated quarantine site.
宾馆房间宾馆条件还不错，每个人一个标间。
Hotels and Hostels are in good condition. Everyone has a standard room.
一日三餐，生活用品都非常齐全。
Three meals a day, the daily necessities are very complete.
我们需要什么的话也可以告诉工作人员。
We can tell the staff what we need.
就是这里的管理比较严格，我家人之前给我送东西过来，只能送到封锁区外，由那里的人交给宾馆的人，他们再通知我去大堂拿。
The administration here is more strict, my family sent me things before, can only be sent outside the closed area, the people there to the hotel people, they told me to go to the lobby to pick up.
提供的晚餐朋友就住在隔壁，我们虽然不能串门，但至少可以隔墙聊天，因为这里的隔音有点差。
Supper friends live next door, we can not visit the door, but at least can chat through the wall, because the noise here is a bit bad.
现在，我就想先上两个星期网课再说，反正“最坏”的结果就是本学期休学，到时学校也应该会有政策，所以并不是很慌，能回国就已经很满足了。
Now, I'd like to take a couple of weeks of tennis lessons first. Anyway, the "worst" result is the suspension of school this semester.
