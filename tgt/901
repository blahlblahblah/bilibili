作者 | 第一财经张苑柯元宵节刚过，疫情之下第一批复工潮正式启动。
First Finance Zhang Yuan Ke Lantern Festival just passed, the first batch of workers under the epidemic began.
与往年不同的是，伴随着对流动人员的监测要求，异地员工到岗前必须隔离多至14天，单位到岗率高低不等。
In contrast to previous years, the monitoring requirements for staff on the move were accompanied by the requirement for remote staff to be segregated for up to 14 days prior to their arrival, with varying levels of unit arrival.
第一财经记者采访多家进出口生产企业发现，企业普遍反映防护装备物资存在短缺情况，保障员工健康安全存在挑战。
The first financial reporter interviewed a number of import and export production enterprises found that enterprises generally reflect the shortage of protective equipment and materials, to safeguard the health and safety of employees there are challenges.
义乌当地某服饰公司财务总监告诉记者，因为前期回公司的人员各自都在宿舍观察，企业并未正常运行。
Yiwu local clothing company financial director told reporters, because the early return to the company's personnel are observed in the dormitory, the enterprise is not normal operation.
企业原有员工2500人左右，目前预计能有600人左右可于10日开工，可使四个厂区中的一个厂区开始进入生产状态。
The company has about 2,500 employees, and is now expected to be able to start about 600 people 10 days, so that one of the four plant sites into production.
“当下的主要困难在于面临开工延期、工人短缺情况下导致的订单违约风险，目前已向商务局申请不可抗力证明并向客户做好解释工作。
"The main difficulty right now is to face the risk of contract defaults due to delayed start-up and shortage of workers. We have now applied to the Commercial Affairs Bureau for a certificate of force majeure and explained to our customers."
”该财务总监称。
'said the finance director.
某太阳能企业则表示，企业在疫情期间一直没有停工，但目前缺人是个难题，返厂员工住宿存在困难，也不能招聘新员工。
A solar energy company said the company had not stopped work during the epidemic, but the lack of personnel is a challenge, returning to the factory staff accommodation difficulties, and can not recruit new staff.
还有企业表示，由于物流企业和供应商并没有完全复工，直接造成供应链紧张，加上出口收汇存在的问题，企业过关不易。
Enterprises also said that because logistics enterprises and suppliers did not fully resume work, directly caused supply chain tension, coupled with export earnings problems, enterprise clearance is not easy.
对中小企业而言，疫情下的复工面临重重挑战，企业主正在努力做好应对，寻求各种解决方案。
For small and medium-sized enterprises, the return to work in the context of the epidemic faces many challenges, and business owners are working hard to respond and find solutions.
疫情中的创业者温绵绵（化名）是一家宠物产品公司的创业者，1月22日她从武汉回到老家荆门，当其他省市的朋友问她是否需要口罩时，绵绵说：“先寄给武汉的朋友们吧，他们更需要。
When friends from other provinces and municipalities asked her if she needed a mask, she said, "Send it first to your friends in Wuhan, they need it more.
”1月25日，她发现自己开始低烧咳嗽，伴随着腹泻。
On January 25, she found herself with a low fever and cough, accompanied by diarrhea.
“没事的，先自己在家隔离吃药，我身体底子好，再说也不一定就中招了呢。
"It's all right, first their own isolation to take medicine, my body is good, and after all, not necessarily confessed.
”她安慰着家人和朋友。
She comforted her family and friends.
1月26日，高烧39度的绵绵拿到医院CT检查单，结果显示两肺见多发散磨玻璃密度片影，边缘模糊不清。
On January 26, a high fever of 39 degrees stretching to the hospital CT examination list, the results showed that the two lungs see multi-divergence grinding glass density film, the edge blurred.
绵绵也终于忍不住向朋友们发出求助，荆门的物资告急，家里的消毒剂已经用完，口罩也只剩最后几只。
Finally, I could not help asking my friends for help. Jingmen's supplies ran out, the disinfectant at home was used up, and only a few masks remained.
为了不传染给家人和他人，高烧的绵绵一直独自开车往返于医院和家中。
In order not to infect the family and others, the high fever has been driving to and from the hospital and home alone.
29日，绵绵二次CT时“白肺”现象已经很明显，情况再度恶化的绵绵终于被医生安排了住院隔离，绵绵的父母也作为密切接触者被隔离。
29, the "white lung" phenomenon is already evident on the second CT, the situation deteriorated again was finally arranged by doctors in isolation, the parents as close contacts were also isolated.
“住进医院我就放心了，平时我坚持健身，一定可以扛过去。
"I was relieved to be admitted to the hospital, I usually adhere to fitness, can certainly carry over.
”▲温绵绵摄于湖北荆门在接受记者采访时，绵绵的身体状况正在逐步好转，但依旧咳嗽不止。
The unbroken body was gradually improving during an interview with reporters in Jingmen, Hubei Province, but she still coughed.
她表示，疫情对公司的发展肯定有较大的影响，很多原先制定好的年后工作计划基本都要调整，物流、线下渠道都在疫情下受到了比较大的影响。
She said the epidemic will certainly have a greater impact on the company's development, many of the original work plan after the year to adjust, logistics, offline channels have been relatively affected by the epidemic.
由于目前新公司人不多，大家尽量节省开支，同时开展一些能够短期内“回血”的业务，帮助公司熬过这段非常时期。
With so few new companies, everyone is trying to save money and start businesses that can "bleed back" in the short term to help the company tide over this extraordinary period.
“好消息是，年前谈好的募资并没有黄，但销售工作就有点麻烦了。
"The good news is that the good fund-raising negotiations did not turn out to be yellow, but the sales job was a bit of a hassle.
”绵绵说道，销售工作涉及员工出差，所以基本都取消了，但她相信疫情过后，公司业务很快能够步入正轨。
Sales jobs, which involve employee travel, have largely been canceled, she said, but she believes the company's business will soon be back on track after the epidemic.
“身边的人一直在鼓励我，给我加油，这些对我来说是重要的。
"It's important to me that people around me keep encouraging me and cheering me on.
”她说。
'she said.
王晓浒（化名）是一家主营线上食品和快消品销售公司的创始人，公司注册在上海。
Wang Xiaohu Hu (alias) is the founder of a main online food and fast disappearing products sales company, registered in Shanghai.
对他的公司来说，疫情带来的最大影响是仓库员工复工的问题。
For his company, the biggest impact of the epidemic has been the return of warehouse staff to work.
疫情重点地区的员工暂时回不来，回上海的员工则需要自我隔离一段时间。
Workers in key areas of the epidemic are temporarily unable to return, while those returning to Shanghai need to isolate themselves for a while.
“线上销售最重要的就是发货时效性，而现在时效性无法保证。
"The most important thing in online sales is the timeliness of delivery, and there is no guarantee of timeliness.
”他称。
"he said.
其次，上半年的市场推广及整合营销的方案都需要更改，短期内大众对于广告的接触方式，如高铁、飞机、电影院等场景都已改变，“这相当于，年前投入的一些市场推广成本打了水漂。
Second, marketing and integrated marketing initiatives in the first half of the year need to be revamped. In the short term, public exposure to advertising, such as high-speed rail, planes, cinemas, etc., has changed.
”王晓浒认为，企业虽然很艰难，但目前要做的就是配合执行国家的各项要求，早日战胜疫情，企业能早日找到出路。
"Wang Xiaoxu believes that although the enterprise is very difficult, but now must do is to cooperate with the implementation of the country's requirements, an early victory over the epidemic, enterprises can find an early way out.
仓库缺人的情况下，王晓浒的公司采取临时换岗制度，征用在上海未出沪的员工去仓库发货，同时给仓库员工配备口罩、消毒水、护目镜、手套等保护物品。
In the absence of a warehouse, Mr. Wang's company adopted a temporary shift system, commandeering employees in Shanghai to deliver goods to the warehouse, and equipping warehouse staff with face masks, disinfectant, goggles, gloves and other protective items.
作为过年前后未出过上海的“无病毒合格人员”，王晓浒今天第一个出现在了仓库。
As the Chinese New Year before or after the Shanghai "virus-free qualified personnel," Wang Xiaoxuang today was the first to appear in the warehouse.
“员工回不来，我们一个人顶五个先用起来，再累也要保证市民的包裹准时投递。
"Employees can not go back, we have to use up five first, and then tired to ensure that citizens on time delivery of the package.
”他说。
'he said.
▲王晓浒摄于上海仓库怎么发工资是个难题留学回乡的杭州人郑琛（化名）前不久刚将自己的公司以股权置换的形式卖给了一家国际企业，公司专做品牌管理、商务信息咨询以及网上的批发和零售，主要的收入来自咨询管理服务费和销售所得佣金。
Wang Xiaoxuang in Shanghai warehouse how to pay wages is a difficult problem returned home Hangzhou Zheng Chen (alias) recently sold his company to an international company in the form of stock exchange, specializing in brand management, business information consulting and wholesale and retail online, mainly from consulting management fees and sales commissions.
他告诉第一财经记者，公司的主要资产就是“人”，现在最大的挑战是客户不开工，就没有服务费可以收，而销售下滑导致佣金也大幅缩水。
'The main asset is people, 'he told First Financial.' The biggest challenge now is that customers don't start, there's no service charge, and the commission rate drops sharply as sales fall.
“平时我们会估算仓库的周转率，为降低成本尽量做到不压货，现在则面临着库存里的货都卖光了补不到货，就算补到货也受到物流限制卖不动货。
"Normally we estimate the turnover of the warehouse and try not to underwrite the cost. Now we are faced with a situation where we are out of stock and we can't make up for it.
” 郑琛表示，已经有客户表示，非常时期根据不可抗力条款，暂停支付一个月的服务费。
Mr Cheng said customers had indicated that the one-month service fee had been suspended under the force majeure clause during the emergency.
由于公司是项目制的，员工人数取决于项目数目，服务费的报价包含了员工工资。
Since the company is project-based and the number of employees depends on the number of projects, the price for services includes staff salaries.
服务费暂停，员工工资却需要正常发放，甚至在疫情期间远程工作的员工工资需要翻倍计算。
Service fees are suspended, staff salaries need to be paid normally, and even the payroll for telecommuting during an epidemic needs to be doubled.
好在郑琛的公司现金流还算稳定，目前尚无贷款，“撑到2月末问题不大，但3月开始可能就有些艰难了，”他称，“还好公司被收购了，实在不行还可以向总公司求助一下。
Fortunately, Zheng Chen's cash flow is stable, there is no loan, "until the end of February is not a big problem, but it may be a bit difficult to start in March," he said.
”现金流的问题虽然不用发愁，但是员工发工资却遇到了难题。
The cash flow problem isn't worrying, but employees are having trouble paying their salaries.
郑琛告诉记者，公司国内员工69人，国外有700多名员工，现在公司大楼进不去，原本7号就该发出的工资至今还未发出。
Zheng Chen told reporters that the company's domestic staff of 69, foreign more than 700 staff, now the company building can not enter, the original 7 on the salary has not yet been issued.
“现在是特殊时期，如果再不发工资，员工的日子更难过了。
"These are special times, and if we don't get paid again, employees are worse off.
” 郑琛称，正在协调各方解决这一问题。
Zheng Chen said he was coordinating efforts to resolve the issue.
同样为发工资犯愁的还有做影视及视频媒体运营的陈挚（化名），他在南京的公司通过购买各种版权视频并进行剪辑和编辑，再将视频发行至各个新媒体平台赚取平台分成或广告费。
Also worrying about payrolls are Chen Zhi (not his real name), who runs the film and video media. His Nanjing-based company buys copyrighted videos and edits and edits them, then distributes them to new media platforms to earn a share of the platform or advertising money.
疫情来袭，上游方的素材版权方停止了供给，许多主播也减少了素材供应，能剪辑的内容减少了。
Upstream copyrighted material stopped being supplied, many anchors reduced the supply of material and cut back on clips.
加上正值2月淡季，人力本身就紧缺，疫情爆发后3倍工资也难以请到人，远程办公的效率只有原来的70%。
Coupled with the low season in February, when manpower itself was scarce and triple wages were not available after the outbreak, telecommuting was only 70 per cent efficient.
而诸如直播、转码等需要在公司盯着的工作，目前也只能搁置。
And jobs such as live broadcasting, switching code and so on that need to be stared at in the company, can only be shelved.
这都让陈挚看着干着急。
This lets Chen Zhi see dry anxious.
“最重要的是公司的现金流，我们一部分收入是从海外新媒体收取，银行网点缺人入账，我们等于没有收到这笔钱。
"The most important thing is the company's cash flow. We receive part of our revenue from new media from overseas and we don't get the money because we have a missing bank branch."
但是工资依旧按翻倍计算，设备照样开着，水电房租一分都不能少。
But wages are still doubled, the equipment is still on, and the rent for water and electricity is no less than a penny.
”陈挚表示，现在等着园区的复工通知，目前能做的就是“炒冷饭”，把以前的内容加工重新做一遍。
Chen Zhi said that now waiting for the park to resume work notice, what can be done is "fried rice," the former content processing again.
“有的员工已经提出辞职，还有个别员工不肯远程工作，也因为担心传染不肯回来。
"There have been resignations, individual employees who have refused to work remotely and who have refused to return for fear of infection.
”陈挚坦言，疫情持续到现在深深感受国家的不容易。
Chen said frankly that the epidemic continues until now to feel the country is not easy.
没有物资，口罩是他托关系自己背回家的，酒精是酿酒的邻居那讨来的，消毒液是养猪场朋友那里买的库存。
With no supplies, the mask was carried home on his own account, alcohol was bought by the brewer's neighbors, and disinfectant was bought from a pig farm friend.
公司开销不断上升，园区要求公司物资齐全才能上班，在不断延期和等待通知中，陈挚整夜难眠。
Companies are spending more and more, the campus requires the company to be fully equipped to go to work, Chen Zhi in constant delays and waiting notice, sleepless all night.
好在公司还有些储备，陈挚称只要能发工资就能安定人心，今年还是能大干一场。
Fortunately, the company has some reserves, Chen Zhi said as long as the salary can settle the hearts of people, this year can still do a big.
暂时搁置的海外业务“我们这个行业叫外贸综合服务业，简单讲就是给出口企业提供外贸的综合性服务，目前公司全球大约有170名员工，国内106名。
Our business is called comprehensive foreign trade service industry, in short, it is to provide comprehensive services to export enterprises, the company has about 170 employees, 106 domestic.
”浙江某供应链服务公司负责人邓先生对第一财经记者表示，复工需要上报当地政府审批，作为当地第一批复工的企业，2月10日大约有42个工作人员到岗。
Deng, head of a supply chain services company in Zhejiang, told the first financial reporter that the resumption of work needed to be reported to the local government for approval.
“其实我们在初六、初七就已经有一部分同事开始上班了，有些之前谈好的业务，包括年前出货周的期单寄送等都需要人提前操作。
"In fact, we have a number of junior high school, junior high school colleagues have started to work, some good business, including the pre-shipment week, such as the need to pre-processing.
”邓先生表示，目前供应链的上下游都受到了疫情影响。
Mr Deng said the epidemic was affecting both upstream and downstream parts of the supply chain.
上游的工厂交期后推，并且可能连明确的交付时间也不能确定。
Upstream plant deliveries are delayed and may not even specify delivery times.
“我预计，快的话，3月初有些工厂能够开始交付订单并出运货品。
"I expect that soon some factories will be able to start placing orders and shipping goods in early March.
”总的来看，邓先生认为行业面临几大挑战。
Overall, Mr Deng believes the industry faces several major challenges.
首先是合同风险。
The first is contractual risk.
跟外商签的合同交期变更需要协商，比如找当地政府开具不可抗力的证明帮助解决违约问题。
Contract delivery changes signed with foreign investors require negotiation, such as seeking a certificate of force majeure from the local government to help solve the problem of default.
“市场是一环扣一环的，很多海外客户接了下游的订单，需要一些证明才能和他们的客户谈，好在政府很快给企业开具了不可抗力的证明，也帮助企业节省了沟通成本。
"The market is interlocking, with many overseas customers taking orders downstream and needing some proof to talk to their customers. Fortunately, the government quickly issued force majeure certificates to companies and helped them save on communication costs.
还有的海外客户会主动慰问中国的合作企业是否需要物资上的帮助。
Other overseas customers will offer their sympathy to Chinese cooperators if they need material assistance.
”邓先生称，大多的海外企业很理解中国企业的处境，愿意协商调整合同，但也存在少数的直接取消合同的情况。
Mr Deng said most overseas companies understood the situation of Chinese companies and were willing to negotiate adjustments, but there were a few cases of outright cancellations.
其次是货品出运挑战，在目前空运、海运和内陆物流滞缓的情况下，损失在所难免。
The second is the challenge of shipping goods, which is inevitable in the light of the current slowdown in air, sea and inland logistics.
邓先生坦言：“现在工厂已经做好的货走不掉，生产企业自身的销售受到影响，未能如约收货进行生产加工的企业也受到影响。
Deng admitted: "Now that the factory has finished the goods can not go away, the manufacturers own sales have been affected, the failure to meet the contract for the production and processing enterprises have also been affected.
”第三是资金风险，包括合同变动导致客户付款无法到位、汇率波动、员工工资发放等。
The third is financial risk, which includes changes in contracts that prevent payments from customers, currency fluctuations and payroll.
“细节流程中的难处，还有很多。
"There are many difficulties in the details process.
”邓先生说。
"said Mr. Deng.
这些挑战，在一季度可以撑一撑，邓先生担心，到了第二季度，可能很多海外企业也等不住了。
These challenges can be sustained in the first quarter, and Mr. Deng worries that by the second quarter, many overseas companies may not be able to wait.
“订单如果取消，订金退回的流程在国际贸易中是很严格的，还要承担汇率的风险。
"If the order is cancelled, the deposit refund process is very strict in international trade, also bear the exchange rate risk.
”另外，在原材料紧缺的情况下，涨价在所难免，企业的利润将进一步压缩。
In addition, with raw materials in short supply, price rises are inevitable and profits will shrink further.
艰难的环境下，邓先生表示，贸易企业积极应对很关键，不能因为疫情自暴自弃。
In a difficult environment, Mr. Deng said it was crucial for trading companies to respond aggressively and not abandon themselves because of the outbreak.
他建议，首先，可以通过主动的正式邮件、信息等方式告知所有客户中国疫情的状况。
First, he suggested, all customers could be informed of the epidemic in China through active official mail, information and other means.
比如主要在湖北地区，政府已经采取延期工厂开工、学校开学的措施以减少传播，相关的治疗药物也在临床应用中，部分病人已经开始康复出院，相信疫情很快会得到完全控制。
For example, mainly in Hubei province, the government has taken measures to postpone the opening of factories and schools in order to reduce the spread of diseases. The related treatment drugs are also in clinical use, some patients have started to recover and leave the hospital, believing that the epidemic will soon be completely under control.
“这样做后，客户表示理解，甚至有人表示愿意捐赠口罩或者经费。
"After that, the customer showed understanding and even offered to donate masks or money.
”对于已经签署采购和销售合同的订单，一方面要主动与工厂沟通复工条件，按照国家规定的复工时间，最快交货。
"For orders for which purchase and sales contracts have been signed, the factory must be actively contacted to resume work conditions and be delivered as quickly as possible in accordance with the state's time limit for resumption of work.
同时，主动和客户沟通销售情况、库存储备情况，并主动告知可能延期交货时间区间，让客户有心里准备，并尽可能保持高频沟通，减少相互的影响。
At the same time, proactively communicate with customers about sales, inventory status, and proactively inform customers of possible extended delivery time intervals, so that customers are prepared, and as far as possible maintain high-frequency communication, reduce mutual impact.
对于年前由于物流拥挤未能出运的货物则需要尽快与货代确定时间发出，不要让成品积压在国内，影响客户销售。
For goods that could not be shipped due to heavy logistics need to confirm with the freight forwarder as soon as possible, do not let the finished products accumulate in China, affecting customer sales.
同时，做好提单等外贸单证寄送工作；查询出运物流信息同步于客户，关注提货动向；不要因为复工延期忘记或者没有落实好日常的工作，影响客户。
At the same time, do a good job of sending foreign trade documents such as bills of lading; check shipping logistics information synchronize with customers, pay attention to the movement of goods; Do not delay or not implement the daily work, affecting customers.
“另外要关注收款，对于异常情况要及时做信保报损或者催收；关注汇率，建议近半年的出口贸易可以考虑锁汇。
"In addition to pay attention to the collection, for abnormal conditions to do timely letter loss or collection; attention to the exchange rate, it is suggested that nearly half a year of export trade may consider locking foreign exchange.
”邓先生表示，企业还需要主动和准备来华的客人沟通，正在申请签证或者已经拿到签证的客户，需要请客户到中国大使馆沟通。
Mr Deng said companies also needed to proactively communicate with customers who were planning to come to China, and customers who were applying for visas or had already received them needed to contact the Chinese embassy.
关于修改入境时间，他建议改为3月之后。
With regard to the revision of the time of entry, he suggested that it should be after March.
与此同时，所谓“金三银四”，不应耽误新的一年人力资源优化和补充工作。
At the same time, the so-called "three silver four" should not delay the new year human resources optimization and complementary work.
各地可以通过视频、电话面试等方式和优秀的人才保持良好沟通，待复工后见面可以加快彼此的决策。
Everywhere can be through video, telephone interviews and other means to maintain good communication with excellent people, to meet after returning to work can speed up each other's decision-making.
最后，对于复工后仍需要暂缓来公司的个别地区的同事，做好这期间薪资等方案的准备；安排好过渡期的工作，让员工安心，让业务流畅。
Finally, prepare your colleagues in individual areas who need to put off coming back to work for a period of time, such as salary plans, and plan for the transition period so that employees can feel at ease and make their business flow smooth.
