Wuhan closed the Han Road, the city has been isolated from itself for a month, this month, our knowledge of Wuhan is constructed from a variety of information reports.
那么，经历了“封城”一个月的武汉，到底怎么样了？━━━━━最好的消息 确诊病患增长率仅0.7%495人确诊，23人死亡，这是1月23日，武汉封城第一天的数字。
What happened to Wuhan after a month of "sealing the city" The best news is that the confirmed patient growth rate was only 0.7 percent 495 confirmed and 23 people died, according to figures from the first day of the city closed on January 23.
截至2月22日，武汉已有46201人确诊，1856人病亡。
As of February 22, Wuhan has 46,201 confirmed cases, 1,856 people died.
疫情防控依旧面临严峻形势。
The epidemic is still under severe strain.
1月27日之后，从报告的新增病例情况看，湖北、武汉的疫情出现了大流行，呈现点状的、局部地区的暴发和多点、多地的大面积多发。
After January 27, according to the new cases reported, there has been a pandemic in Hubei and Wuhan, with localized outbreaks and multiple, multi-point outbreaks.
2月20日，国新办新闻发布会上，中央指导组成员、国务院副秘书长丁向阳如是说。
On February 20, China's new press conference, Central Steering Committee member, State Council Deputy Secretary-General Xiangyang said.
在这一个月内，武汉地区的确诊病例增长率有所减缓，2月21日累计确诊病例45660例，但新增仅314例，确诊病患的增长率（新增确诊病例数/累计确诊病例数）达到新低0.7%。

在所有医护人员的努力下，病死率也呈现下降态势，治愈率不断攀升。

截至21日，武汉市已有7206名患者治愈出院。
As of July 21, 7,206 patients in Wuhan city have been cured and discharged.
在2月20日，新增治愈出院病例也首次大于新增确诊病例。
On 20 February, the number of new cases cured was also higher than the number of newly confirmed cases for the first time.
目前，武汉地区新增确诊病例数依旧波动不定，未现明显拐点；新增疑似病例近两周呈波动下降趋势，疑似病例存量正逐步消化；现有重症病例比重仍旧居高不下，目前（截至2月22日24时）为25.5%，高于湖北其他地区同期水平。
At present, the number of newly confirmed cases in Wuhan is still fluctuating, and there is no obvious inflection point. The number of newly suspected cases fluctuates and decreases in the past two weeks, and the stock of suspected cases is gradually digesting.
━━━━━对抗疫情的床位越来越多“封城”以来，随着确诊病患的不断增加，对医疗的需求就越大，面对突如其来的疫情，武汉的医院能接纳这么多人吗？根据武汉市卫健委官网自2月1日起发布的“全市定点医院病床使用情况”数据显示，定点医院及其床位数量一直在增加。
Dedicated hospitals and their number of beds have been on the rise since the outbreak of the disease, with the number of patients diagnosed increasing and the need for medical care increasing, can Wuhan hospitals accommodate so many peopleAccording to the figures on hospital bed utilization in designated hospitals all over the city released by Wuhan Health Officers' Network since February 1, the number of designated hospitals and their beds has been increasing.
但随着武汉的新冠肺炎患者确诊数量越来越多，定点医院的床位显得不够用，这个时候，方舱医院的建成和使用起到了非常重要的作用。
However, with the increasing number of confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in Wuhan, the number of beds in designated hospitals seems to be inadequate, at this time, the construction and use of the square cabin hospital played a very important role.
除了48家定点医院，武汉市方舱医院开舱的也有13家，有13348张床位，其中已使用了9313张，收治难的问题得到有效解决。
In addition to the 48 designated hospitals, 13 hospitals with 13,348 beds were opened in Fang Cao Hospital in Wuhan City, of which 9,313 were used, effectively solving the problem of medical treatment.
据了解，下一步武汉市将继续扩容，再建19家方舱医院。
It is understood that the next step Wuhan City will continue to expand capacity, the construction of 19 cabin hospitals.
争取到2月25日，全市储备的方舱医院床位数量将达到30000张。
By February 25, the city will have 30,000 beds in its stock of square-cabin hospitals.
同时也将加强方舱医院医疗设备的配置，提升方舱医院的救治病人的能力。
At the same time will strengthen the medical equipment configuration of the square cabin hospital to improve the ability to treat patients.
除了定点医院和方舱医院，部分学校宿舍也被征用。
In addition to the designated hospital and the square cabin hospital, some school dormitories were also requisitioned.
据武汉市发布的《关于进一步规范新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎定点收治医院患者收治工作的通知》得知，目前定点医院主要用于收治重症、危重和疑似危重病例；方舱医院主要用于收治轻症患者；而被征用的学校宿舍，则部分作为医疗点收治轻症患者，另外一部分作为隔离点，接收密切接触者和疑似患者。
According to the notice issued by Wuhan on further standardizing the admission of patients to hospitals designated for treating new coronavirus infections, designated hospitals are mainly used to treat serious, serious and suspected serious cases.
物尽其用，地尽其利，正是在这种举全市之力共抗疫情的努力下，患者才能得到最好的治疗，治愈出院患者不断增加。
Making the best use of our resources and making the best use of our resources, it is in this city-wide effort to fight the epidemic, patients can get the best treatment, curing the growing number of patients discharged from the hospital.
━━━━━武汉 你不是一个人在战斗疫情当前，告急的可能不止床位，专业医护人员才是战胜疫情的“定海神针”。
2006-03-15 09: 23 You are not alone in the current fighting epidemic, the urgent may be more than beds, professional health care professionals is to overcome the epidemic "Dinghai pin."

Known as the "most beautiful inverse walker," with eyes full of mountains and seas, their arrival to a large extent alleviated the Wuhan medical personnel shortage situation.
疫情在加深，一线医护人员防护物资每一天都在消耗，口罩、防护服、护目镜，平时这些生活中不太用到的物品在这个时候变得尤为珍贵。
As the epidemic deepens, first-line health-care supplies are being consumed every day. Masks, protective clothing, and goggles are especially valuable at this time.
