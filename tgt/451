1988年1月，上海爆发大规模甲型肝炎传染病，最终确诊病例高达31万人，临近的浙江也有7万例，这次甲肝的导火索是食用不洁毛蚶——一种形似蛤蜊的贝类。
In January 1988, a large-scale hepatitis A epidemic broke out in Shanghai, resulting in 310,000 confirmed cases and 70,000 cases in neighboring Zhejiang. The trigger for hepatitis A was a clam-like shellfish cockles.
32年之后，再次提起这次疫情，每一个老上海人仍记忆犹新，它留给上海的不只是记忆，而是一个越来越完备的公共卫生系统——在面对重大疫情时，各级医院职责分工明确，专科医院和三甲医院之外，上海一个重要优势在于近200家二级综合医院，以保证临时性的统一调度。
Thirty-two years later, every old Shanghainese still remembers the epidemic, not just memories, but an increasingly sophisticated public health system.When faced with a major epidemic, hospitals at all levels have a clear division of responsibilities.
往下到社区医院，上海是全国率先培养社区医院全科医生的城市。
Down to the community hospital, Shanghai is the first city in China to train community hospital general practitioners.
再具体到社区及个人，市民与政府间的互动相对良性且有效。
More specifically in the community and individuals, the interaction between the citizens and the government is relatively benign and effective.
直到今天，新冠肺炎尚未控制，武汉出现的局面，都与自上而下整体医疗系统的混乱密切相关。
Until today, the new crown pneumonia has not been controlled, Wuhan's situation, and the whole top-down medical system is closely related to the chaos.
在这方面，不能说上海没有漏洞，但从32年前控制“甲肝大流行”的一些措施到现在，不仅为上海市防控各种突发传染病积累了经验，也对当下的其他城市有一定借鉴意义。
In this respect, it cannot be said that there are no loopholes in Shanghai, but the measures taken to control the "hepatitis A pandemic" 32 years ago have not only accumulated experience for the prevention and control of various outbreaks of infectious diseases in Shanghai, but also have some reference value for other cities in the world.
记者 |薛芃生食毛蚶引发的疫情1988年春节，上海和现在的武汉一样紧张。
Ariel's outbreak of spring festival in 1988 was as intense as this one now is in Wuhan.
街面上冷清又萧条，了无生气，各大医院每天挤满了人，多是来检测肝功能的。
Street cold and depressed, lifeless, the major hospitals every day filled with people, mostly to detect liver function.
1月18日，《解放日报》报道称上海发现20多名因食毛蚶患甲肝的病人，并指出“甲型性肝炎病毒平均潜伏期为30天左右，以发病前5天和到发病后一周内传染性最强。
On January 18, the Liberation Daily reported the discovery of more than 20 cases of hepatitis A caused by cockles in Shanghai and noted that "the average incubation period of hepatitis A virus is around 30 days, with the virus becoming most infectious five days before onset and up to one week after onset."
”那天之后，每天的确诊病例呈指数级增长，1月22日，808例；1月27日，5467例；1月31日，12399例。
After that day, there was an exponential increase in the number of confirmed cases per day, 808 on 22 January, 5,467 on 27 January and 12,399 on 31 January.
从1月19日到3月18日两个月中，累计确诊病例29.2万余人，在拐点之后，到5月时，这个数字维持在31万不再上升，最终有31人因甲肝合并其他并发症死亡，这场“甲肝大流行”平息。
From January 19 to March 18, the cumulative number of confirmed cases of more than 292,000 people, after the inflection point, by May, the number remained unchanged at 310,000, and eventually 31 people died from hepatitis A and other complications, the "hepatitis A pandemic" subsided.
随着1988年上海宝山“撤县设区”，当时上海市的常住人口达到1200余万人，30多万人确诊意味着，每10个家庭中就有一例感染甲肝。
With the 1988 "district evacuation" of Baoshan in Shanghai, where the resident population reached more than 12 million, the diagnosis of more than 300,000 people meant that one in 10 households was infected with hepatitis A.
毛蚶是上海人爱吃的水产品，在买肉还需要肉票的年代，买毛蚶可不需要票，便宜又味道鲜美。
Mowling cockles is a Shanghai people like to eat aquatic products, in the purchase of meat also need meat tickets in the age, do not need tickets, cheap and delicious.
老上海人有时爱贪美味，用开水简单冲泡一下活毛蚶，把不熟的毛蚶肉挖出来沾上调料就吃，若是熟的就没这滋味了。
Old Shanghainese sometimes love to eat delicious, with boiled water simply soak live hair cockles, will not be cooked chowder dug out dip seasoning to eat, if cooked will not taste.
那一年，江苏启东的毛蚶大量涌入上海市场，但受到了粪便的严重污染，一并带来的还有大量细菌。
That year, Qiedong, Jiangsu Province, a large influx of cockles into the Shanghai market, but was seriously contaminated with excrement, along with a large number of bacteria.
元旦刚过，上海不少医院就接到发烧、阵发性腹痛、上吐下泻的病人，起初的警报是细菌性食物中毒，直到1月中旬，市卫生局才将疫情定性为甲型性肝炎，因为甲肝病毒有长达一个月的潜伏期，在此之前无法做出准确判断。
Just after the New Year's Day, many hospitals in Shanghai received fever, paroxysmal abdominal pain and diarrhea. The initial warning was bacterial food poisoning. It was not until mid-January that the Municipal Health Bureau classified the outbreak as hepatitis A because of the one-month incubation period before accurate diagnosis could be made.
其实在1982年底到1983年初，上海就爆发过一次因食用毛蚶引发的甲肝疫情，当时仅上海传染病医院就收治了1040名病人，但事后并未引起警觉，甚至当时制定的一系列卫生监督规章也都形同虚设，自上而下都没什么人重视。
In fact, in late 1982 and early 1983, Shanghai outbreak of hepatitis A caused by cockles, when the Shanghai Infectious Disease Hospital alone admitted 1,040 patients, but did not cause alarm, even a series of health supervision regulations at that time are ineffective, top-down people pay little attention.
5年后，同样的疫情变本加厉地在上海重现。
Five years later, the same epidemic is reappearing in Shanghai.
上海第二军医大学附属长征医院感染科主任医师缪晓辉，多年来一直从事感染病学与肝病学研究。
Dr. Miao Xiaohui, director of infection department of Changzhi Hospital attached to Shanghai Second Military Medical University, has been engaged in infectious and hepatology research for many years.
1988年缪晓辉还在医大读研究生，第一次参与到了如此大规模的流行病救治中。
He was a graduate student at MU in 1988 and for the first time was involved in the treatment of such a pandemic.
缪晓辉指出，从传染病的角度来看，甲肝与新冠肺炎是两种完全不同的传染病，并无可比性。
Miao pointed out that from the point of view of infectious diseases, hepatitis A and new crown pneumonia are two completely different infectious diseases and are not comparable.
甲肝是消化道传染病，通过粪-口途径传播，而且这种病毒是一个已知的存在很久的老病毒，相对容易控制。
Hepatitis A is an infectious disease of the digestive tract, transmitted via the faecal-oral route, and the virus, a well-known old virus, is relatively easy to control.
甲肝的传染性不及新冠肺炎，呼吸道传染病通过飞沫传播，而消化道传染病虽是接触传播，但它会发生隐性感染和顿挫性感染，也就是说，接触者并未生病，但感染后自身产生抗体，因而在临床上几乎不显示出任何症状，只有通过免疫学检查才能发现，这样一来，就不容易意识到自己被感染。
Hepatitis A is less infectious than Newcomial Pneumonia, respiratory infections are transmitted in droplets, while infectious diseases of the alimentary canal are transmitted by contact, that is to say, contacts do not get sick but produce antibodies of their own, thus showing few clinical symptoms that can be detected only through immunological examination, which makes them less likely to become infected.
还有一点是，甲肝属于自限性疾病，有些感染者可以通过自身的免疫力控制住病毒的复制，从而自愈，但在这个过程中，他可能依然是一个传播源。
Another thing is that hepatitis A is self-limited, and some infected people can self-heal by controlling the replication of the virus with their own immunity, but he may still be a source of transmission in the process.
潜伏期长，表征不显著，让甲肝的排查变得更难了。
The latency is long and the characterization is not significant, making the detection of hepatitis A more difficult.
初建良性系统这次疫情对当时的上海而言，更重要的是把所有问题暴露出来——并不太卫生的卫生条件和集体式居住环境成了病毒蔓延的温床，医疗系统自上而下不够健全，市民意识薄弱。
It was even more important for Shanghai at the time to expose all the problems - unsanitary sanitary conditions and collective living conditions became hotbeds of the spread of the virus, the health-care system was inadequate from the top down, and citizens' consciousness was weak.
虽然上海在全国领先，但与国际先进水平相比还差不少。
Although Shanghai is ahead of the rest of the country, it is still far from the international advanced level.
在当时，粪便管理仍是一个社会问题。
At the time, faecal management was still a social problem.
老上海的弄堂里，家家户户都挨着，有的有公共厕所，有的没有，家里的马桶都拿到外面刷，一早便能听到哗哗啦啦刷马桶的声音。
In the old Shanghai churchyard, families are next to each other, some have latrines, some don't, all have their toilets outside, and the clatter of toilet-cleaning can be heard in the early morning.
当时的《解放日报》中写道：“漫步上海街头，不难看到马路两边大刷马桶的景观，更有甚者刷完马桶的水就直接泼倒在马路旁，尽管旁边就是个大饼油条摊，也从不顾忌。
"Walking through the streets of Shanghai, it is not difficult to see the view of the toilet on either side of the road," the then-Liberation Daily wrote. "What is more, the toilet water is thrown directly down the road, even though there is a big cake-and-pastry stand next to it.
进入公共厕所也不乏见到大粪四溢、小便横流的情景。
Access to public toilets was also marked by cases of overflowing excrement and urination.
如果倚在苏州河边的栏杆上，很快就会发现一船船不加盖的运粪船正把那些未经处理的有机肥料运向乡间。
If you lean against the railings of Suzhou's riverside, you will soon find that a boat of uncapped dung ships is carrying untreated organic fertilizer into the countryside.
完全不能排除这种可能性——不久后同样这些运粪船未经任何消毒处理就运回一船船的青菜、各种农产品，当然也有毛蚶，然后卖到各家各户的饭桌上。
This possibility cannot be ruled out at all - the same dung tankers were soon returned without any sanitization to a boat carrying vegetables, produce of all kinds and, of course, cockles, and then sold to every family table.
这些没有任何消毒的运粪船加上当地同样不符合卫生要求的粪便管理，又污染着沿海滩涂，包括毛蚶生长地。
These unsterilized tankers, coupled with local manure management, which also does not meet sanitary requirements, pollute coastal beaches, including cockles.
”自来水也不是户户都有，打来的水往往反复使用，狭窄的里弄里住满了男女老少，更是提供了病毒二次传播的土壤。
Tap water is not available to households, and the water is often repeatedly used. Narrow alleys are filled with men, women and children, providing fertile ground for the retransmission of the virus.
上世纪80年代末，上海90%以上的企业都是国有企业或集体所有制企业，300多人的厂都配有托儿所、幼儿园、医务室、食堂、宿舍，人们生活在一起，走动频繁，病毒就在不知不觉中传播着。
By the end of the 1980s, more than 90 percent of enterprises in Shanghai were state-owned or collectively-owned enterprises, with more than 300 workers equipped with nurseries, kindergartens, infirmaries, canteens and dormitories.
1月中旬，疫情迅速蔓延开来。
In mid-January, the epidemic spread rapidly.
当时上海所有医院的床位只有约5.5万个，很快就饱和了，与此同时，医务人员也非常紧缺。
All the hospitals in Shanghai had only about 55,000 beds and were rapidly running out of beds, while there was a severe shortage of medical staff.
1月24日，上海市政府召开紧急会议统一协调管理，自上而下地去调度一切可用资源。
On January 24, the Shanghai Municipal Government convened an emergency meeting to coordinate and manage all available resources from the top down.
当时负责疫情统一调度协调的是卫生局，时任市卫生局局长谢丽娟说话很密，办事雷厉风行，医生们都叫她“谢老太太”。
At the time in charge of the unified epidemic coordination is the Health Bureau, then-Director of the Municipal Health Bureau Cherry Cherry spoke very close, rapid action, doctors called her "old lady Xie."
在那场疫情中，市区两级卫生局构成了重要的环节，并且尽量减少其他多余环节。
In that outbreak, the urban two-tier health authorities formed an important part of the epidemic and minimized other unnecessary links.
这个春节，邓小平是在上海过的，某种程度上也是市民的一颗定心丸。
The Spring Festival, Deng Xiaoping is in Shanghai, to some extent is also a reassuring public.
应对传染病疫情，最重要的是控制传染源（病人）和切断传播途径，减少二次传播。
The most important thing in dealing with an epidemic is to control the source of infection (the patient) and cut off the transmission route to reduce secondary transmission.
收治病人的病床是当务之急。
The admission of beds for patients is a priority.
上海市在第一时间征用了多家当时还没开学的中小学，把病人集中隔离治疗。
Shanghai first requisitioned a number of primary and secondary schools that had not opened at the time, concentrating patients in isolation and treatment.
缪晓辉跟随长征医院的医务团队，被分配到一所位于浦东的中学，5层楼的教学楼里，每间教室都摆满了折叠的钢丝床收治病患，待到疫情结束后，这些钢丝床又低价卖给了医院的医务人员，留作家用。
He was assigned to a secondary school in Pudong, a five-story building filled with folded wire beds for patients. By the end of the epidemic, the beds had been sold to hospital staff at low prices for writers.
此外，许多企业都把闲置的厂房、库房腾出来，安置甲肝病人，一些小旅馆也空出客房接收病人。
In addition, many enterprises have vacated idle factory buildings and warehouses to accommodate hepatitis A patients, and some small hotels have also vacated guest rooms to receive patients.
在当时，甲肝并没有特殊的治疗方法，主要是在急性期保肝、退黄和对症、营养支持治疗，绝大多数病人，一旦病情稳定，就不再会加重，也很少出现其他并发症，除非有严重的基础疾病，最终病故的人中多有慢性疾病，且年纪较大。
At that time, there was no specific treatment for hepatitis A, mainly in acute phase of liver protection, yellow and symptomatic treatment, nutritional support treatment, the vast majority of patients, once stabilized, will no longer be aggravated, and few other complications will occur, unless there is a serious underlying disease, and most of those who eventually die are chronically ill and older.
因此在隔离的现场，护士比医生更多，也更重要。
So there are more nurses at the quarantined site than doctors, and more important.
事后统计显示，当时上海市10多万医务人员中，有6万多人扑到一线，在防治肝炎期间，全市共增设12541个隔离点和118104张床位，其中卫生系统增设了243个隔离点和60434张床位，卫生系统收治甲肝患者98591人，全市共设家庭病床29338张，这些临时的举措都成为一个引子，为后来更完备的公共卫生系统打下基础。
Statistics show that during the prevention and treatment of hepatitis, 12,541 quarantine points and 118,104 beds were added to the city, including 243 additional isolation points and 60,434 beds for the health system, 98,591 patients for hepatitis A and 29,338 family beds throughout the city.
疫情之后，谢丽娟指出，这场甲肝“对于上海改善公共卫生条件、应对公共卫生突发事件、建立流行病预警机制、构建现代公共卫生安全体系等方面具有积极影响”。
After the outbreak, Cherry Juan pointed out that this hepatitis A "has a positive impact on Shanghai to improve public health conditions, respond to public health emergencies, establish an epidemic warning mechanism, and build a modern public health security system."
“如今看来，甲肝这个病已经没什么新鲜的，但是当疫情来临时，怎么去发动基层的力量，怎么把所有的病人有效控制起来，如何宣传，如何建立现代的更科学而严密的公共卫生系统，以及后来甲肝疫苗的研发和普及，以上问题的解决和推进，如果没有这场疫情，可能都会延后。
"Now it seems that hepatitis A is nothing new, but when the outbreak comes, how to mobilize grass-roots forces, how to effectively control all patients, how to publicize, how to build a modern, more scientific and rigorous public health system, and later the development and popularization of hepatitis A vaccine, these problems could all be delayed if the epidemic does not exist.
”缪晓辉说。
"said Muse.
如今上海会如何应对？根据“上海发布”的通报，截止2月5日24时，上海最新报告确诊新冠肺炎254例，目前，这些确诊病患都在金山区的上海市公共卫生临床中心接受治疗。
As of 2400 hours on February 5, 254 new cases of pneumonia had been confirmed in Shanghai, and the confirmed cases were being treated at the Shanghai Public Health Clinic Center in Jinshan District, according to the report.
这个公共卫生中心，是2003年“非典”留给上海的一个“遗产”。
The public health center is a legacy of SARS left to Shanghai in 2003.
“非典”之后的第二年，中心建立，选址在远离上海市市区60公里的金山区，建制人员以原先的上海市传染病医院为主， 如今是上海市乃至整个长三角地区应对突发公共卫生事件的重镇，也可以理解为上海的“小汤山”。
In the second year after SARS, the center was set up in a golden mountain area 60 kilometers away from downtown Shanghai. Formed personnel mainly from the former Shanghai Infectious Disease Hospital, it is now a major town in Shanghai and throughout the Yangtze River Delta region to cope with public health emergencies.
在2003年的“非典”疫情中，上海最终确诊8例，并且无医护人员感染。
During the SARS epidemic in 2003, eight cases were finally diagnosed in Shanghai and no medical staff were infected.
无论是横向还是纵向对比，这都是一份不错的成绩单。
This is a good report card, both horizontally and vertically.
SARS不但给上海留下了这个公共卫生中心，而且又为后来的传染病疫情积攒了经验。
SARS not only left Shanghai with the public health center, but also accumulated experience for the later outbreak of infectious diseases.
尽管如此，此时此刻面对新冠肺炎的上海依然无法乐观，每一个环节都非常紧张。
Nevertheless, at this moment in the face of new crown pneumonia in Shanghai is still not optimistic, every link is very tense.
缪晓辉也明确指出，如果如此大规模的新冠肺炎发生在上海，也同样无法应对，但在一些具体环节上不至于像现在这样兵荒马乱。
Miao also made it clear that if such a large-scale pneumonia in Shanghai, but also unable to cope with, but in some specific links less than the current military chaos.
金山区的公共卫生中心拥有500个床位，这在目前武汉的确诊病例数量面前，仍是杯水车薪。
The Jinshan public health center has 500 beds, which is still a tiny fraction of the number of confirmed cases in Wuhan.
在面对重大疫情时，上海一个重要优势在于二级综合医院，而不是专科医院。
In the face of a major epidemic, an important advantage of Shanghai lies in the secondary general hospital, not the specialized hospital.
上海只有6家市级的拥有传染病专科的三级甲等医院，分别是长征、长海、华山、瑞金、第六和第九人民医院，而二级综合医院近200家。
There are only six tertiary level A hospitals in Shanghai with infectious disease specialties, namely Long March, Changhai, Huashan, Ruijin, Sixth and Ninth People's Hospitals, while there are nearly 200 level II general hospitals.
所有二级综合医院都必须设发热门诊，以确保发热病人得到符合传染病诊治规范的“专症”门诊就诊，不让这些发热病人“流到”普通门诊，避免院内交叉感染，这是一个基础的筛查过程。
All level II general hospitals are required to have a fever clinic to ensure that febrile patients receive outpatient "speciality" consultations that meet the criteria for the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases, so that they do not "flow" to the general clinic and avoid cross-infection in the hospital, which is a basic screening process.
再往下到社区医院，上海是全国率先培养社区医院全科医生的城市。
Further down to the community hospital, Shanghai is the first city in the country to train general practitioners in community hospitals.
10年左右的时间内，上海的基层社区医院拥有了一批较高水平的全科医生，以应对日常工作和突发疫情。
Within a decade or so, Shanghai's grass-roots community hospitals have had a high level of general practitioners to deal with routine work and outbreaks.
“如此，每一个层级的医院都是一道关卡，不至于当疫情爆发时，所有人都挤在三级综合医院。
"In this way, every hospital level is a barrier so that when an outbreak occurs, everyone is crammed into a level-III general hospital.
”缪晓辉说道。
"said Muse.
一旦要应对大规模传染病疫情时，所有设置有传染科的医院可以在第一时间收治传染病病人，大概可以有500张床位。
In the event of a pandemic, all hospitals with an infectious disease can treat the patient in the first place, with a capacity of about 500 beds.
传染病科的医护人员应对类似新型冠状病毒肺炎这类疾病的隔离和防护，也无需做更多培训，可以迅速上岗。
The staff of the infectious diseases department should isolate and protect against diseases such as the new coronavirus pneumonia.
另一方面，如果专科医院或三级医院传染科不够用，就必须开放一些二级医院，临时改成传染病医院，这种迅速的调度和配合能力是上海医疗系统的另一大优势。
On the other hand, if specialized hospitals or level III hospitals are not adequate, some level II hospitals will have to be opened and temporarily converted into infectious disease hospitals. This rapid scheduling and coordination capacity is another major advantage of the Shanghai medical system.
春节期间，二级医院的床位使用率明显下降，有的仅在30%左右。
During the Spring Festival period, the utilization rate of beds in level II hospitals decreased markedly, some only in the vicinity of 30%.
换言之，如果把这30%的病人转移到其他医院，就可以将这家区级医院完全改建成传染病隔离医院。
In other words, if 30 per cent of the patients were transferred to other hospitals, the district hospital could be completely converted into an infectious disease isolation hospital.
如果上海一个区拿出300个床位，十个区就是3000张，合计就达到4000张床，甚至更多。
If a district in Shanghai had 300 beds, ten districts would be 3,000, making a total of 4,000 beds or more.
再具体到社区及个人，上海市政府对市民的动员速度很快，简单来说，就是市民“听话”，相互之间是有所呼应的，有互动性。
More specifically to the community and individuals, the Shanghai Municipal Government's mobilization to the public is very rapid, in short, the public "obedient", is a response to each other, interactive.
当看到上海市民在社区排队领口罩，每个人之间自动间隔一米的画面时，大抵就能理解这种关系了，也可见市民的自我防范意识之强。
When people in Shanghai line up in the community to get masks, and each person is automatically separated by a meter, the relationship can be largely understood, you can also see the strong sense of self-defense.
经历过近几十年的传染病重大疫情，上海的现代公共卫生防疫系统日趋成熟，并在每一次突发疫情中不断地适应、调节、优化。
After the serious epidemic of infectious diseases in recent decades, Shanghai's modern public health and epidemic prevention system is becoming more mature, and constantly adjusts, adjusts and optimizes itself in every outbreak.
不能说如今没有漏洞，依然会出现很多问题，但当机制逐步完善后，个体将会在这个机制中更有效地发挥独特性作用，弱化其机械化的功能，从而让这个完整的链条顺利运转，这或许可以给其他城市提供一点启示。
It cannot be said that there are no loopholes and many problems will still arise, but when the mechanism is perfected, the individual will be able to play a more effective and unique role in the mechanism, weakening its mechanized function, thus allowing the complete chain to function smoothly, which may provide some inspiration to other cities.
2月5日，华山医院感染科主任张文宏指出，随着武汉“封城”两周过去，“第一批输入性病例潜伏期将要过去，湖北以外各地疫情将进入以输入性疫情后的本地散发和聚集性二代病例发病的第二阶段。
As Wuhan "closed" two weeks ago, "the incubation period for the first batch of imported cases will be over, and the epidemic outside Hubei will enter the second phase of the local transmission and aggregation of second-generation cases following an imported epidemic," Zhang Wenhong, director of infection department at Huashan Hospital, said.
”这就意味着，其他地区和城市的管控和统一协调调配能力更加重要。
This means that the ability of other regions and cities to regulate and coordinate is all the more important.
而对于此刻的上海来说，更大的挑战也将在未来十天。
For Shanghai at the moment, the bigger challenge will be in the next 10 days.
当等待返沪的大量人口回到上海，这个城市不再处于“静止”状态时，城市的公共卫生系统又将面临一轮新的压力，伴随而来的，也是一次新的升级。
As large numbers of people wait to return to Shanghai and the city is no longer at rest, the city's public-health system will face a new round of pressure, accompanied by a new escalation.
