记者/ 魏晓涵编辑/ 石爱华 宋建华王放在上海拍摄到的貉一场疫情，让野生动物重回人们的视野。
Reporter / Wei Xiaohan editor / Shi Aihua Song Jianhua Wang on the raccoon dog shooting in Shanghai, let the wild animals back to the people's vision.
除了“吃野味”和“携带病毒”，很多人对城市里的野生动物知之甚少。
Besides "eating game" and "carrying viruses," many people know little about the wildlife in cities.
当这些“邻居”无意造访人类的世界时，有人害怕、恐慌、手足无措，把它们天然地放在了“对立面”。
When these "neighbors" do not want to visit the human world, some people fear, panic, helplessness, put them naturally on the "opposite side."
新冠肺炎疫情的出现，让很多普通人开始思考一个问题，“我们到底该如何与城市中的动物相处？”王放是城市里长大的孩子，从小在北京生活。
The outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia has led many ordinary people to ponder the question, "How do we get along with the animals in the city?" Wang Fang, a child raised in the city, lived in Beijing from an early age.
在他的记忆里，80年代的北京城能常常见到胆小的松鼠和黄鼠狼，随着城市的发展，现在“只能专门去找了”。
In his memory, Beijing City in the 1980s can often see timid squirrels and weasels, with the development of the city, now "can only find the special."
寻找的结果依旧出乎他的意料——“城市动物的种类和数量都远远超过普通市民的想象，它们也可以长期和人类维持和平共处的关系”。
The results were still surprising - "urban animals are far more diverse and numerous than ordinary citizens can imagine, and they can maintain peaceful co-existence with humans for a long time."
结束了在北大和美国史密森学会、密歇根州立大学的研究生涯后，王放供职于复旦大学生物多样性科学研究所。
Wang worked at the Institute of Biological Diversity at Fudan University after a research career at Peking University, the Smithsonian Institution and Michigan State University.
他以上海为据点，在最近一年时间，和团队成员展开“城市里的公民科学家”项目，招募市民，共同记录城市里野生动物的行动轨迹和生存状况。
Based in Shanghai, he has spent the past year working with team members on the "Citizen Scientist in the City" project, recruiting citizens to document the movement and survival of wild animals in cities.
疫情之下，他们布设在公园、小区、森林里的八十台红外相机日夜不息地记录着野生动物的生活轨迹。
Under the epidemic, 80 infrared cameras placed in parks, communities and forests keep track of wildlife day and night.
在王放看来，城市野生动物管理是一个复杂的问题，它不仅意味着动物保护和科普、居民观念的改变，还涉及到破坏和传染病的问题，但有一点无需质疑——野生动物的多样性，对一座城市的生态环境有着重要意义。
In Wang Fang's view, the management of urban wildlife is a complex issue, which means not only the protection of animals and changes in science and public perception, but also the problems of destruction and infectious diseases, but there is no doubt that the diversity of wildlife is of great importance to the ecological environment of a city.
以下是王放的口述。
The following is Wang Fang's dictation.
王放给志愿者讲述项目内容城市“避难所”在北京的闹市区，我许多次见到过野生的黄鼠狼。
City Shelter In downtown Beijing, I have seen weasels in the wild many times.
有的在国贸、海淀黄庄，有的在景山、鼓楼东大街、和平里。
Some in the world trade, Haidian Huangzhuang, some in Jingshan, Drum Tower East Street, peace.
而在上海的青浦区、金山区、奉贤和南汇，都能见到野生貉的身影——这是一种胖胖的山地动物，你可能还听过关于它的成语，“一丘之貉”。
Wild racoons are found in the Qingpu, Jinshan, Fengxian and Nanhui regions of Shanghai. They are fat mountain animals.
如果把范围外延放大，城市里的野生动物还是相当多的。
If you zoom in, there are still quite a few wild animals in the city.
以北京为例，城区里常见的有黄鼠狼、刺猬、金花鼠和岩松鼠，当然有大量的鸟和昆虫。
In Beijing, for example, weasels, hedgehogs, goldflower mice and rock squirrels are common in urban areas, as are, of course, large numbers of birds and insects.
把周边的密云、门头沟、延庆、昌平算上，一些体型较大的动物就会出现了，比如远东狍、野猪、豹猫等等。
Consider the surrounding clouds, ditches, Yanqing, Changping, some of the larger animals will appear, such as the Far East roe, wild boar, leopard cat and so on.
我们可能想象不到，城市里一些野生动物分布之广，适应性之强。
We may not imagine that some of the wild animals in the city are widely distributed and adaptable.
如果你让我画一张没有黄鼠狼出现的北京地图，是有困难的，通常小区周围两三公里范围内就能见到它们的身影。
If you ask me to draw a map of Beijing without a weasel, it's difficult to see them, usually within two or three kilometers of the neighborhood.
我们做生态学研究，在上海的公园通过红外相机拍到的野生动物，可能比在野外的闽山或者秦岭山脉里拍到的都多，只不过豹猫换成了刺猬、黄鼠狼。
We do ecological research, the park in Shanghai through infrared cameras may be more wildlife than in the wild Min Shan or Qinling mountains, but the leopard cat replaced with hedgehog, weasel.
这些野生动物体型比较小，都挺聪明的，能迅速调节自己的活动时间来适应城市生活。
The animals are small, intelligent, and can quickly adjust their time to city life.
我曾经和它们度过一些奇妙的时光。
I used to spend some amazing time with them.
在一个深夜，一只貉和我在上海的青浦区相遇，它好几次一屁股坐在我脚下，挠痒痒发呆。
Late one night, a raccoon dog and I met in the Qingpu district of Shanghai. It sat down at my feet several times, tickling and tickling.
而在晚上六七点，天色还没完全暗下来的北京，黄鼠狼会大摇大摆地出现在小区里，它们面对人类似乎很淡定，周围车来车往，离着两三米的地方还有人在散步、遛狗，要知道原本它们应该是很胆小的动物。
But at six or seven in the evening, before it was completely dark, weasels would swagger into the neighborhood, seemingly indifferent to humans, surrounded by cars, and walking and walking dogs two or three metres away, knowing they were supposed to be timid animals.
和二十几年前相比，我的感受是，城市里的野生动物变少了，和人相处起来也更镇定了。
Compared with more than 20 years ago, my feeling is that there are fewer wild animals in the city, and I get calmer with people.
我从小在北京长大，80年代那会儿，海淀到处都有小河，还能经常冒出泉水来，北大周围有许多荒山。
I grew up in Beijing, when the 1980s, there are rivers everywhere Haidian, can often come out of the spring, there are many barren hills around Peking University.
那时候整天到处能见到刺猬、松鼠，记忆中它们羞怯而胆小，更多在离人远一点的地方。
Hedgehogs and squirrels were to be found all day, and their memories were shyly and timid, more distant.
再早一点，70年代，北京的西直门、北太平庄这些地方还有狼存在，郊区能看到豺。
Earlier, in the 1970s, there were wolves in Xizhimen and Beiping Taiping Zhuang in Beijing, and jackals could be seen in the suburbs.
后来城市的大环境发生了很大变化，小时候的树林、野地都没有了，荒山变成了超市、社区和小广场，动物生活的地方肯定是变少了，估计数量可能是以前的1/5，甚至更少。
Since then, great changes have taken place in the urban environment. Trees and fields have disappeared as children, and barren hills have become supermarkets, communities and squares. Animals must live in fewer places.
不过它们可能目睹人类的活动多了，知道什么时候该躲，不像以前那样胆小羞怯。
But they may be seeing more human activity and know when to hide, rather than being as timid as before.
这个观察和国际上大家对城市动物的观察是基本吻合的。
This observation is consistent with international observations of urban animals.
城市天然地吸引着野生动物，它的特殊性能给一些野生动物提供保护。
Cities naturally attract wildlife, and their special properties provide protection to some wildlife.
现在野外已经很难见到野生的貉了，以前在大小兴安岭、华东华中、云南贵州都能见到它们的身影，但过去三十年它们像是灭绝了一样，我们猜测这个种群中可能突发了某种致命的疾病。
Wild racoons are now hard to find in the wild. They used to be found in Daxing'an Mountain, Central China in East China and Guizhou in Yunnan Province, but they seem to have died out in the past 30 years.
在上海，发现超过60个小区都有貉，我们是很吃惊的。
In Shanghai, we are surprised to find that more than 60 neighborhoods have raccoons.
城市好像一个避难所，野外的世界天翻地覆，这个“保护区”里的貉反而能蓬勃旺盛地生存下去。
Cities are like sanctuaries, the wild world is overthrown, and racoons living in this "protected area" are able to thrive.
它们在十几年里适应了城市生活，它们在下水道和排风口附近生活。
They have adapted to city life for more than a decade, living near sewers and drains.
原来在野外抓青蛙、抓小鱼、小虾，在城市里变成了翻垃圾桶、吃猫粮，甚至到食堂和饭馆周围看看能不能捡一些残羹剩饭。
Originally in the wild catch frogs, catch small fish, shrimp, in the city turned over garbage cans, eat cat food, even around the cafeteria and restaurants to see if can pick up some leftovers.
于是，貉成为我们在城市里寻找野生动物的起源。
Raccoon dogs are the source of our search for wild animals in cities.
正月初十这天，上海市闵行区野生动物保护管理站的工作人员出动了六次，接到报案驱赶居民在家庭周边见到的越冬蝙蝠（图片来自网络）冲突和共存野生的貉怎么没有了？我们尝试去找原因，没有相关的资料。
On the 10th day of the first month, the staff of the Min Hang District Wildlife Management Station in Shanghai sent out six times to receive reports that the overwintering bats seen by residents around their homes and the raccoon living in the wild were gone.
貉不是“保护动物”，以往通常是养殖场用来提供皮毛的，所以我们只能找到怎么给它打药、吃抗生素、看病的资料，但在自然的状况下，这个种群经历了怎样的变化？非常遗憾，找不到这样的记录。
Raccoon dogs, which are not "protected animals," used to be farmed to provide fur, so we can only find out how to prescribe drugs, take antibiotics, or see a doctor.
在疫情发生之前，我们带着一百个市民志愿者，在上海的公园、社区安装红外摄像头，记录貉在内的野生动物的活动。
Before the outbreak, we took with us a hundred citizen volunteers to install infrared cameras in parks and communities in Shanghai to record the activities of wild animals, including racoons.
现在因为疫情我们不能回收设备，这八十多个摄像头还在日夜不停工作着，它们有的在人活动比较多的地方，有的在森林里，有的在湿地附近，我们希望监控的区域能覆盖所有类型的城市环境。
Now that we can't recycle because of the epidemic, these 80 cameras are still working day and night, in places where people are more active, in forests, near wetlands, and we want to monitor areas that cover all types of urban environments.
这些志愿者是我们通过“公民科学家”项目招募来的，有教师、政府工作人员、程序员、学生，各种各样的人都有。
These volunteers are recruited through the Citizen Scientist program and are available to teachers, government workers, programmers, students, and a wide variety of people.
有一个来自上海市宝山区教育局的女士，计划直接把研究数据拿进课堂做科普；还有一个拍上海这座城市的纪录片导演，要把我们的调查记录下来。
There was a woman from Shanghai's Baoshan Education Bureau who planned to take the research data directly into the classroom to popularize science, and a documentary director who filmed the city of Shanghai to document our investigation.
它好像是一个有生命力的东西，自己在生长。
It seems to be a living thing, growing on its own.
我们在上海的小区做调研的时候发现，大多数居民对野生动物的态度是友好的，但其中掺杂着比较多、比较复杂的意见。
When doing research in our small area in Shanghai, we found that most residents were friendly towards wild animals, but mixed with more complex opinions.
有的时候，貉会去翻人类的阳台，把花盆打翻，或者把花园挖出洞来，居民就会有意见。
Raccoon dogs that rake a man's balcony, overturn a flowerpot, or gouge out a hole in a garden can make a difference to residents.
貉喜欢集中排便，如果正好堆在谁家窗口、楼下，就会有不满了。
Raccoon dogs like to concentrate on defecation, if just pile in whose window, downstairs, there will be dissatisfaction.
野生动物和人在城市里产生冲突，是很常见的，尤其是生态好的地方。
Conflicts between wildlife and people in cities are common, especially in ecologically sound areas.
我在美国做博士后研究的时候，就遇到过大脑袋的浣熊扒拉开研究所的推拉门，瞪着水汪汪的眼睛找人要食物和水。
When I was doing my postdoctoral research in the United States, I came across a huge head of raccoons pulling the push and pull doors of the Institute and staring at its watery eyes for food and water.
被喂过的浣熊发现人可以提供食物，就会跑到人的房屋里偷东西，咬坏窗户、甚至毁坏房屋。
When raccoons were found to be able to provide food, they would run into people's homes, bite on windows and even destroy houses.
在美国，每年就损坏房屋这一项，浣熊带来的损失可能超过千万美元，同时可能引起火灾、漏电等等。
In the United States, raccoons can cause more than $10 million a year in damage to homes and can cause fires, power leaks and so on.
在美国，不只是浣熊，郊狼、负鼠、臭鼬和人的冲突也非常多。
In the United States, it is not just raccoons, coyotes, possum rats, skunks, and humans that clash.
我有好几个同事的车或者人被臭鼬喷过，味道重到车基本两周不能开，短期之内甚至会让人和宠物双目失明。
Several of my colleagues had their cars or people sprayed by skunks that tasted so heavy that they couldn't drive for two weeks and could even blind people and pets in the short term.
去印度开会的时候发现，那儿的豹子会跑到城市里杀狗、甚至伤害人；而在欧洲，野猪、松鼠、狐狸同样会带来经济损失。
During a meeting in India, the leopard ran to the city to kill dogs and even hurt people. In Europe, wild boars, squirrels, foxes can also cause economic losses.
另外一个问题来自野生动物携带的传染病。
Another problem comes from infectious diseases carried by wild animals.
美国有一种叫莱姆病的疾病，靠蜱虫传播。
There is a disease called Lyme disease in the United States that is spread by ticks.
城市周围有很多白尾鹿，蜱虫吸了它们的血再去吸人血，就会把野生动物身上的传染病带到人身上，我们研究所几十个人就有三个同事得过这个病，其中有一个还伴随很严重的过敏反应，一度需要打大量的激素来维持生活。
There are a lot of white-tailed deer around the city. When ticks suck their blood and inhale human blood, they bring infectious diseases from wild animals to people.
渐渐我们发现，其实人和动物的冲突是非常正常的事儿。
Gradually we discovered that it was quite normal for humans to clash with animals.
随着中国的城市生态越来越好，野生动物在城市聚集的越来越多，可能二三十年后，动物和人在城市的冲突一定会成为一个问题，到时候再调查就晚了。
As China's urban ecology grows better and more wild animals congregate in cities, it may be 20 or 30 years before the conflicts between animals and people in cities become a problem and it will be too late to investigate.
我们现在先积累数据，也许以后就能用到。
We can accumulate data now, and maybe we can use it later.
现在研究刚开始进行不久，目前有一大批仪器和设备在城市里自动记录，因为疫情的原因没办法回收数据。
Now the research is just beginning, there is a large number of instruments and equipment automatically recorded in the city, because the cause of the epidemic can not recover data.
后续还会和动物直接接触，例如给貉带上GPS定位项圈追踪它的行动轨迹，看看在城市里它会遇到些什么麻烦。
It also comes into direct contact with animals, such as racoons with GPS locators to track their tracks and see what kind of trouble they encounter in the city.
现在顾虑到疫情，大家可能有恐慌，进行的都是无接触的调查。
Now that we are worried about the outbreak, there may be panic, and no contact investigations have been carried out.
这个城市里的野生动物寻找会持续多长时间？我希望是永远。
How long will the hunt for wildlife in this city last? I hope it will last forever.
真的是这样，只要我们在上海，工作就不会停，因为城市环境在不断变化中，所以这个事儿没有结束的那一天。
Really, as long as we are in Shanghai, the work will not stop, because the urban environment is constantly changing, so this is not the end of the day.
横跨五环的动物通道（效果资料图）跨五环的动物通道我们在上海调研的时候，有居民也会担心貉会不会带狂犬病？刺猬有没有可能携带吸血蜱虫？这样的可能性理论上存在，但只要人不去触摸就好。
Animal Channel Across the Five Rings When we study in Shanghai, some residents will worry about rabies in racoons. Is it possible for hedgehogs to carry chlorpyrifos? The possibility exists in theory, but only if people don't touch it.
人不主动接触、投喂野生动物，见到之后也不必驱赶甚至投毒。
People do not come into contact with the wild animals, do not see the need to expel or even poison.
长远来看，我们可以把城市野生动物疾病的监测网络建立起来，更理想的状况下，可能需要定期给野生动物取样，看它们有没有携带传染病。
In the long run, we can set up a network to monitor urban wildlife diseases, and ideally sample wild animals on a regular basis to see if they have infectious diseases.
现在是存在这个网络的，但调查力度可能不够，不能充分让大家安心。
The network exists now, but the investigation may not be strong enough to reassure everyone.
其实从市民的角度来说，能做的有限，更大的挑战交给了城市设计者。
In fact, from the point of view of the public, can do a limited, greater challenge to the city designers.
如果城市有一些好的设计，比如一望无际的草坪周围种一些灌木、矮树，人和动物直接“大眼瞪小眼”的状况就不会出现。
If cities had good designs, such as shrubs and bushes around endless lawns, there would be no direct "big eyes" for humans and animals.
在北京，野生动物需要喝水的时候可能会去京密引水渠或是昆玉河，但是堤岸是水泥的，动物只能集中在一两个能靠近水的地方。
In Beijing, wild animals may go to the Jingmi Aqueduct or the Kunyu River when they need water, but the embankments are concrete and animals can only be concentrated in one or two places close to the water.
但比如像莱茵河或是曼哈顿河，周边是自然的堤岸，有很多松软的泥土，接近水的地方比较多，动物和人使用这些河湖就有更多的选择，自然分割开了。
But for example, the Rhine or the Manhattan River is surrounded by natural embankments, with lots of soft soil and more access to water, so that animals and people have more options to use these rivers and lakes.
这些年，我们的城市也在做很多的尝试。
Over the years, our city has also been trying a lot.
最典型的是北京的奥林匹克森林公园，刚开始建设的时候是一个大荒滩，建成三年之后，公园里出现的鸟就超过了200种。
Typical of these is the Olympic Forest Park in Beijing, which started out as a vast wasteland with more than 200 species of birds three years after it was built.
这个公园南北两块被五环路隔开了，动物要穿行怎么办？他们就给野生动物设计了一个专门的通道，过街天桥似的，像一个盖子盖在五环上方。
The park was separated by the Fifth Ring Road between the north and the south, and what if the animals had to cross it? They designed a special passageway for wildlife, like a footbridge, with a lid over the five rings.
刚开始设计的时候，谁也拿不准动物会不会用。
At the beginning of the design, no one is sure whether the animals will be used.
建完之后很快发现，刺猬、黄鼠狼真的会用这个通道，通道周围种了树和灌丛，动物发现能走，闷头就过去了，在五环的两侧左右来回跑，这是挺好的一个尝试。
When it was finished, it was discovered that hedgehogs and weasels could indeed use the tunnel. Trees and thickets had been planted around the passageway.
有奥林匹克森林公园这样好的案例，也有破坏的例子，喜忧参半。
There are good examples of the Olympic Forest Park, as well as examples of destruction, with mixed results.
比如城市里对动物最大的威胁来自除虫剂、除草剂和鼠药的滥用。
The biggest threat to animals in cities, for example, comes from the misuse of pesticides, herbicides and rodents.
投放之后，可能老鼠、害虫没有被杀灭，或者很快恢复，但是这个地方的刺猬、松鼠、螳螂就再也恢复不了了。
Mice and pests may not have been killed or quickly recovered, but this place's hedgehogs, squirrels, and mantis will never recover.
只要这些毒药在，就很难说城市里动物的生存环境是好的。
As long as these poisons are present, it is difficult to say whether the living environment of the animals in the city is good.
欧洲人在评价自己森林的时候有个词，叫空林（Empty Forest），说的是森林虽然恢复得很好了，但是里面没有动物，这种森林是没有生态功能的。
Europeans have a word for their forests, Empty Forest, which says that although the forests are recovering well, there are no animals in them, and this forest has no ecological function.
我们的城市生态建设肯定是越来越好，但这个过程中需要防止空林。
Our urban ecological construction is certainly better and better, but we need to prevent empty forests in the process.
被用过化学药品的绿地，看着很美，但是没有功能的。
The green area, which had been used as a chemical, looked beautiful, but it had no function.
王放在上海街边遇到的貉野生动物与城市价值我们会觉得一些城市很美，国内的大理有苍山洱海，杭州有西湖、小山丘陵，国外有爱丁堡、华盛顿，包括巴塞罗那这样的城市，人在里面生活得很舒服。
We will find some cities beautiful, such as Cang Shan Erhai in China, West Lake and hills in Hangzhou, and cities like Edinburgh and Washington, including Barcelona, where people live comfortably.
一个原因是，自然和人的活动是镶嵌在一起的。
One reason is that nature and human activities are embedded together.
就像我们说到北京最美的地方，老北京有个“燕京八景”的说法，一定都是地名和自然景观的结合，比如蓟门烟树是有树的，金台夕照有山和夕阳。
As we speak of the most beautiful place in Beijing, there must be a combination of place names and natural scenery in old Beijing. For example, thistle trees have trees.
这是理想化的城市图景。
This is an idealized picture of the city.
许多国外的城市，自然骨架没有动过。
In many foreign cities, the natural skeleton has not been disturbed.
例如纽约，在人口和高楼密集的城市中心，保留了一个中央公园，随时能见到松鼠这样的野生动物。
New York, for example, retains a central park in a densely populated urban center, ready to see wild animals like squirrels.
从城市建成的第一天，就确定了野地是要留下来的。
From the first day the city was built, it was determined that the wild land was to remain.
中国的城市人口密集的区域很多，沿着北京五环转一圈，没有人口密度低的地儿。
China's densely populated urban areas are many, along the five rings around Beijing, there is no low-density land.
我们在城市建设的时候，填掉了很多自然（区域），比如北京的北太平庄，以往有十几条河，现在就保留了一条小月河。
We fill out a lot of natural (regional) when we build the city, such as the Beijing Taiping Zhuang, which used to have a dozen rivers, but now we keep a small river.
以前的河流网络在旧城改造的时候填掉了，现在往回找会有一点困难，可能需要用替代性的方式。
The old river network was filled out when the old town was renovated, and now it's a bit difficult to find it back and may have to be replaced.
既然没有大的，我们可以建一些小的生态系统，让它们之间相互连上，实现大的功能的。
Since there are no big ones, we can build some small ecosystems and connect them to one another to achieve great functions.
你要问野生动物在城市里生活情况好吗？我只能给出答案——不好。
Do you want to ask wild animals how they live in the city? I can only give the answer - no.
它们面临各种威胁，来自化学药品，或是植被单一，它们没有遮蔽和食物带来的生存危机，或是城市的流浪猫狗对野生动物的威胁等等。
They face a variety of threats, from chemicals to monocultures, from the lack of shelter and food-related existential crises, or from the threat that stray cats and dogs in cities pose to wildlife.
所以这也是为什么我们一直在跟园林部门沟通，你要种树、灌丛，种一些旺盛蓬勃的乡土物种，让城市的绿地不是观赏性质的，而是有用的。
So that's why we've been talking to the garden department, where you plant trees, thickets, some thriving native species, and make the city's green spaces not ornamental, but useful.
在疫情的特殊时期，城市里类似蝙蝠这样的野生动物会经历一个比较难的时期。
Wild animals like bats in cities go through a difficult period during specific periods of the epidemic.
（注：据媒体报道，疫情期间上海市出现多起居民在家附近发现越冬蝙蝠，引起恐慌的事件；同时有法学专家建议，对容易引发公共卫生问题的动物允许生态灭杀，引发争议）后续可能越来越多的城市去驱赶它们、或是大家躲着它们不去招惹，我们希望能朝着后面一种状况发展，所以我们也一直在和城市管理部门沟通，劝说市民减少不必要的恐慌。
(Note: According to media reports, during the epidemic period there were many cases in Shanghai where residents found winterized bats near their homes, causing panic, and legal experts suggested that more and more cities might follow to expel them or avoid them, so we have been communicating with the city administration to reduce unnecessary panic.
如果有蝙蝠或者其他野生动物误闯入居民家里，可以求助当地的动保机构处理，对野生动物停留过的地方进行消毒，不必灭杀。
If bats or other wild animals break into the homes of residents, they can turn to local action-protection agencies to disinfect areas where wild animals have stayed.
既然野生动物会带来一些麻烦和城市管理问题，它为什么对城市来说还是重要的呢？这是我们做生态学研究的人最不愿意回答，又无法避免的问题。
Why is wildlife so important to cities, given the problems they cause? That's the last question that ecologists are least willing to answer and can't avoid.
如果真的去计算野生动物的价值，大概也能说出一些，比如城市里的蝙蝠能控制苍蝇、蚊子的数量，草地的害虫能交给刺猬，黄鼠狼能减少老鼠的数量。
If we really count the value of wild animals, we might say that bats in cities can control the number of flies and mosquitoes, vermin in the grass can be handed over to hedgehogs, and weasels can reduce the number of mice.
但更重要的是，野生动物是城市价值的体现。
But more importantly, wildlife is an expression of urban values.
城市天然吸引着野生动物，只要我们把城市建设得漂亮，到处有流水、有小山、有旺盛的自然植被之后，野生动物一定会多的。
Cities naturally attract wildlife. As long as we build them beautifully, with running water, hills and rich natural vegetation, wildlife will be plentiful.
反之，没有野生动物，意味着城市本身建设得很糟糕。
Conversely, the absence of wildlife means that the city itself is poorly built.
野生动物多样性是一个城市发展的结果。
Wildlife diversity is the result of urban development.
