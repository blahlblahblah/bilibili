几乎没有看到过上海这么萧瑟的景象，冬天法国梧桐的枝桠本就光秃秃的，将街道原本的模样摊在人们面前。
Hardly had I seen such a bleak sight of Shanghai; the plane trees of France were bare on their bare branches in winter, and spread out before the people the very shape of the streets.
路边的店铺大多都紧锁着门，偶尔能瞥见三三两两的行人，大家也会刻意保持着间距，疾步向前。
Roadside shops are mostly locked doors, occasionally glimpsed in twos and threes of pedestrians, and people will deliberately keep a distance, stride forward.
这个城市似乎正在隐秘地在进行着一次洗牌。
The city seems to be having a private shuffle.
迫于房租、工资、客流等诸多压力，小店们不得不做出应急调整，让自己变得更具生存的适应性。
Under pressure from rent, wages and passenger flow, small businesses have had to make emergency adjustments to make themselves more resilient.
但当疫情开始平缓之后，人们的生活逐渐回归正轨，一切能真的如故吗？这一次我们采访了5家在上海放有故事通讯的小店，从咖啡馆、酒吧、主题书店到选品杂货店，除了关心大家近期在店铺方面都做了什么决定外，还想要了解他们是如何看待这场混沌风暴随之带来的蝴蝶效应。
But when the epidemic began to subside and people's lives were back on track, could it really be? This time, we interviewed five small shops in Shanghai with story lines, from cafes and bars to themed bookstores, to find out what they thought of the Butterfly Effect of the chaotic storm, in addition to the recent store decisions.
采访、撰文 | 奶油 小夜咖啡馆类型：酒吧+咖啡馆 / 店龄：小夜7年，小小夜1年 / 两家店各2名员工丁丁的两间店“小夜“和”小小夜“都坐落于日本人集中的古北区。
Types of coffee shop: bar + coffee shop / store age: 7 years small, 1 year small / 2 employees Ding Ding's two restaurants. Both "midnight" and "small night" are located in the ancient northern area, where the Japanese are concentrated.
白天的小夜是一间主打日式深烘的咖啡馆，晚上又会摇身变为和风酒吧，熟客大多是日本人。
Daytime is a deep-roasted Japanese coffee shop, and at night it turns into a Hooper Bar, mostly made up of Japanese.
而身在进口超市中的小小夜则与之不同，主要服务于外带的客人。
The small evenings at the import supermarket, on the other hand, serve mainly take-out guests.
因为疫情突至，丁丁临时决定暂停小夜白天咖啡板块的经营，但却为了酒吧的老客人们，继续着春节晚上不停业的传统。
Because of the outbreak, Tintin temporarily decided to suspend night coffee operations, but for the bar's old guests, continued the tradition of the Spring Festival evening.
口述者：丁丁“期待平稳之后，大家再来好好喝杯咖啡。
Oral: Ding Ding "We'll have a cup of coffee after we've had a good rest.
”2019年春节我骑电瓶车出了车祸，不小心把脚崴了，只好取消掉小夜白天的咖啡部分。
In 2019, I had an accident with a car in the electric car, and I broke my ankle and had to cancel the coffee part of the day.
所以今年春节要是白天不卖咖啡，也就和去年情况差不多。
So if you don't sell coffee during the day, it will be the same as last year.
我看网上说2月2号到9号是爆发期，在咖啡馆堂食发生交叉性感染的可能性还是蛮高的，所以没有开店。
I read on the Internet that February 2 to 9 is the outbreak period, coffee parlour in the probability of cross-infection is still high, so there is no store.
10号之后如果疫情数字仍然在往上涨，我们就只能采取限流进店，比如18个位置坐9个人，情愿少赚点，也要让大家安全。
After the 10th, if the numbers continue to rise, we'll just have to go into stores, say, nine people in 18 positions, willing to make less money and keep everyone safe.
但晚上就有点为难了。
But the night was a little difficult.
酒吧的老客人们都知道我们春节不休息的，这已经是第7年了。
The old guests at the bar all know that we don't take the Spring Festival off. This is the seventh year.
所以顾及到这一点，小夜咖啡馆晚上20：00—01：00还是会对外开放。
So, with that in mind, the coffee shop will remain open from 20: 00 p.m. to 01: 00 p.m.
往年的情况是大年三十人蛮多的，初二往后变得少点，等到初六再开始回升。
In previous years, the situation is quite a lot of 30 people, after the second day of junior high, until the beginning of the sixth day of recovery.
因为老客人们多数是日本人，除夕前后回国的机票比较贵，往返要7、8千，但晚几天走的话，5千就能搞定。
Since most of the old guests are Japanese, the cost of returning home around New Year's Eve is relatively high, 7 to 8 thousand round trip, but a few days later, 5,000 can be done.
最近这段时间，每晚店里基本只有3、4个客人，这样也刚刚好。
These days, there are only 3 or 4 guests in the store every night, which is just right.
大家依旧习惯坐在吧台，我们尽量把每个人中间隔两个空位。
We're still used to sitting at the bar, and we try to get two slots between each person.
今年来的全都是日本客人，其中一部分是留在上海过年的，另一部分是初七回上海之后却发现上班延期了，再飞回去也不太方便，只能在家办公。
Some of them stayed in Shanghai for the Spring Festival. The other part was a trip back to Shanghai after the first seven days of junior high school.
日本客人本身的防护措施做得比较好，注重消毒、清洁，平时就有戴口罩的习惯。
Japanese guests themselves do better protection measures, pay attention to disinfection, cleaning, usually wearing a mask habit.
他们说虽然看到街上的人都在戴口罩，但挺多人戴反了，还叮嘱我铁片要捏一下才能和鼻子更服贴。
They said they saw people wearing masks on the streets, but many of them put them on the wrong side and told me to pinch the iron to make it more comfortable.
总的来说，他们的恐慌心理没有我们那么严重，觉得做好防护，问题就不大了，甚至时不时会开玩笑，“现在看到满城都是口罩，感觉不是在上海了，明明是在3、4月份花粉症下的东京啊。
In general, their panic is not as serious as ours, and they feel less of a problem when it comes to protection, even at times joking, "Now I see the city full of masks, it's not in Shanghai, apparently in Tokyo in March and April with hay fever.
”而另一家店铺“小小夜”因为身在城市超市里，而且本身就定位为外带型咖啡店，传染几率相对不高。
Another shop, "Little Night," was relatively uninfected because it was in a city supermarket and positioned itself as a take-out coffee shop.
这段时间也是营业的。
This period is also open.
我现在就是两头跑，早上到下午2点在小小夜，晚上再到小夜上班。
I'm two-way through the day, two in the morning, one in the evening, the other in the evening.
有个小姑娘会在中午来小小夜接我的班。
A little girl will pick me up at noon and pick me up.
其他员工之前都放假回家了，遇到现在的情况，临时也找不到人，没办法只能先这样了。
Other employees before the vacation home, encountered the current situation, temporary can not find people, there is no alternative but to do so.
有时间还是会休息一下。
Take a break if you have time.
我本身就喜欢喝咖啡，但在自己店里喝，会保持着在工作的心态，总归不是很放松。
I like to drink coffee myself, but in my own shop, will maintain the mentality of work, always not very relaxed.
所以大年初一的下午，我就跑去OPS和一木家（上海两家咖啡馆）喝了两杯咖啡。
So on the afternoon of New Year's Day, I went to OPS and a wooden house (two cafes in Shanghai) for two cups of coffee.
原本打算4月份在店里开始烘焙咖啡豆，现在只有先把计划放缓了。
The original intention was to start baking coffee beans in the store in April, but now the plan has slowed.
小夜白天暂停的这段时间我就默默琢磨自己的手艺吧，也可以再好好思考我运营的两家店如何做出区别来。
During the break of the day, I muse over my craft and think again about the difference between the two stores I run.
期待平稳之后大家再来好好喝杯咖啡，不知道这样想是不是有点不思进取。
Looking forward to a smooth after a good cup of coffee, I do not know if it is not a little enterprising.
鲸字号类型：书店 / 店龄：2年 / 店员3名2019年夏天，鲸字号书店从上海重庆中路的居民巷弄搬到了繁华的新天地商圈，一度成为了“网红打卡地”，甚至发展到需要客人取号入内。
Whale Style: Bookstore / Store Age: 2 Years / Salesgirl 3 In the summer of 2019, Whale-branded bookstore moved from the downtown Shanghai Chongqing ZhongLu neighborhood to the bustling new world of business, once becoming a "net red card printing ground" and even to the point of requiring a guest to enter.
当传染疫情爆发之后，线下实体行业首当其冲会受到直接性的打击影响，但复合型书店鲸字号的主理人张晔说他们已经做好了硬抗三个月的准备。
When an epidemic breaks out, the offline real industry will be hit hard, but Zhang selected, director of the complex bookstore Whale brand, says they're ready to fight hard for three months.
口述者：张晔“这个时代一直都在变化，它可能不是慢慢变化，而是一下子就改变了。
Oral: Zhang Ye: "This age was changing all the time, it may not change slowly, but all at once.
”我们相比那些重点放在线下的店会好很多，内部还可以承担2月不营业的损失。
"We're a lot better off than stores that focus on offline and can afford to lose February.
因为每年线上插画、视觉类课程的收入大概会占到总收入的8成，在没有搬到现在这个地址之前，甚至占到9成。
Because revenues from online illustrations and visual classes account for about 80% of total income each year, 90% before moving to the current address.
去年，鲸字号成了所谓的“网红店”，单看线下收入，确实有了一些盈利，但并没有大家想象中那么多。
Last year, the Whale name became the so-called "Red Shop," a simple look at offline income, did have some profits, but not as much as everyone thought.
书店好像一直是在鲸字号整体业务里作为辅助的作用，我不会把它放在攻击手的位置。
The bookstore seems to have been playing a supporting role in the overall whale business and I'm not going to put it in the position of an attacker.
虽然店铺延期到3月3日才营业，但这个月我还是会先去店里一趟，做些清洁、整理的工作，也当是记录一下这个难得的时期。
Although the store is not open until March 3, I will go to the store first this month to do some cleaning, cleaning, and also to record this rare period.
我们有个店员人就在武汉，不知道会被关到什么时候，还有一个河北的小伙伴，她那边火车已经停了，最近也要看怎么开车去北京再回上海。
We have a clerk in Wuhan, do not know when will be imprisoned, there is a Hebei side of the train has stopped, and recently to see how to drive to Beijing and then back to Shanghai.
店内原先计划布置的3月初的展览目前都移到了3月中后期，而且展览不是以吸引人流为主要目的，会更多偏向策划一些衍生品售卖。
The planned show in early March has now moved to the middle and late March, and instead of trying to attract crowds, the show is more likely to stage derivatives sales.
本来今年店铺的计划也是要多放一些精力在开发自营文创产品上，把流程系统、主题陈设和产品结构再做升级优化，这些主要是研究客群喜好后做的调整，不完全是为了平销，但也想可以提高客单价。
This year, the store plans to put more effort into the development of self-created products, process systems, theme displays and product structure upgrade, these are mainly after the study of customer preferences, not just for flat sales, but also to increase customer unit prices.
毕竟实体店能够接待的人数是有限的。
After all, the number of people a brick and mortar store can handle is limited.
其实，好多年前书店只卖书就很难做了，如果靠国家补贴运行下去也是不健康的，大家早就需要考虑新的经营模式以达成收支平衡。
In fact, many years ago the bookstore only sold books are very difficult to do, if the state subsidies to run is not healthy, people need to consider a new business model to achieve balance.
很多人认为网购是实体书店很大的对手，但既然意识到了这一点，为什么不把线上业务纳入到整体结构之中呢？尽量还是不要把鸡蛋放在一个篮子里。
Many people think online shopping is a big rival to the physical bookstore, but now that you realize it, why not integrate online business into the overall structure? Try not to put eggs in one basket.
以上的讨论可能仅限于书店，不是所有行业都需要线上业务，但大体是相通的。
The discussion above may be limited to bookstores. Not all industries need online business, but they are broadly similar.
我之前看到一篇文章把未来的书店归结为了几个模式，觉得还是蛮受启发。
I had seen an article on the future of the bookstore for several patterns, or feel pretty inspired.
其中一种模式是会员制书店，它会打包店铺的整体服务，包含不同的活动、优惠、书单等等，然后对社群收取会员费，以此来培养用户的消费习惯和意识。
One such model is a membership bookstore, which packages the store's overall services, including different events, discounts, lists, etc., and then charges a membership fee to the community to foster consumer habits and awareness.
还有一种模式，是像鲸字号一样，属于复合型的，既有自己的主题性选书，也有小型展览、文创品等，整体架构属于比较丰富的状态。
There is also a pattern, like the whale brand, is complex, with its own thematic selection of books, small exhibitions, creations, etc., the overall framework belongs to a relatively rich state.
说起来非典那一年正好是淘宝的上升期，那段日子大家都避免出门不去实体店了，情况和现在很像。
Say SARS that year is just Taobao rise period, that day we all avoid going out physical shop, the situation and now very similar.
这一次的疫情如果把很多人的习惯又改变了，市场上再出现一个新的产品模式的话，那对于传统行业的小店就更难做了。
If the epidemic changes the habits of many people and a new product model emerges in the market, it will be harder for small stores in traditional industries.
这个时代一直都在变化，它可能不是慢慢变化，而是一下就改变了。
This era is changing all the time, it may not change slowly, but at once.
我最担心的是，不知道三月之后街上会变成什么样子。
What worries me most is that I don't know what the street will look like after March.
如果大家都不敢轻易出门，下班了也避免和朋友聚会、购物，你以前常去的那些店没有了，想做的事情不能做了，一切都要再从头开始……想想还是蛮恐怖的。
If people are afraid to go out easily, after work also avoid meeting with friends, shopping, you used to go to those stores are gone, want to do things can not be done, everything has to start all over again...
月球咖啡类型：咖啡馆 / 店龄：5年半 / 店员6名随着确诊人数的增加，上海诸多小区已经开始封锁大门，由于月球咖啡的老店开在安福路居民楼内，现今也只能暂时关门。
As the number of people diagnosed has increased, many neighborhoods in Shanghai have begun to close their doors. Since the old moon coffee shops are in Anfu Road residential buildings, they can only close temporarily.
不过，早在疫情消息出来之前，月球咖啡馆的主理人晓枫已经为月球咖啡的两家店囤好了春节期间所需的全部牛奶......口述者：晓枫“大家隔着口罩聊天的机会，大概就这么一次了，也不希望这样的场景再发生。
But long before word of the outbreak hit, Xiao Feng, head of lunar cafes, had hoarded all the milk needed for the Lunar New Year period for two lunar coffee shops... Oral: 'This is about one chance for people to talk through a mask, and I don't want such a scenario to happen again.
”月球咖啡馆一直都是全年无休的。
Lunar Cafe has been open all year round.
往年，很多上海的客人过年不想去走亲访友、不想去太热闹的地方，就会和朋友过来安静地喝喝咖啡。
In previous years, many Shanghai guests do not want to visit friends and relatives, do not want to go to too busy places, will come over and have a quiet coffee with friends.
我和店里几个小伙伴都是上海本地的，每天还是可以来店里照顾几个小时。
Several of my friends and I are from Shanghai and can come to the store to take care of it for a few hours every day.
现在整个城市都冷冷清清的，本来初四街上有一些店已经开门了，不过在收到尽量2月10号营业的工商通知后又相继关了。
The whole city was now deserted, and some shops in the Rue de l'Ouest had been opened, but had been closed on the tenth of February, on receipt of all possible notices of commerce and industry.
我们在安福路的那家店，开在一个小区里面。
We're at the store on Anfu Road. We're in a small neighborhood.
前不久，我们发现小区开始限制人员进出了，每天都紧闭着大门，于是也只好按小区的安排关店。
Not long ago, we found that the community began to restrict the entry and exit of people, every day closed the door, so we had to according to the arrangement of the district.
我们另一家店在茂名南路上，是街边店。
Our other shop is on Maoming South Road. It's a side store.
这几天来的主要是一些老客人，大家在家憋得实在太久了，忍不住到外面放放风。
These days is mainly some old guests, we have been at home for too long, can not help but go outside to put open the wind.
有的朋友一出来就收不住，可以不停歇地聊上一个小时。
Some friends can't put away when they come out. They can talk for an hour without stopping.
大家隔着口罩聊天的机会，大概就这么一次了，也不希望这样的场景再发生。
The chance to talk through a mask is about this once, and I don't want it to happen again.
疫情消息刚出来的时候，我们已经做好两家店春节期间的囤货安排了，原先还担心会不够用。
When the news of the outbreak first came out, we were already stocking the two stores during the Spring Festival and were worried that it would not be enough.
现在我预估了一下，今年过年期间，店里浪费的牛奶大概有30瓶左右。
Now I have estimated that there will be about 30 bottles of milk wasted in the store this New Year.
真的挺心疼的。
It really hurts.
所以后来我们都会问店里的客人要不要带瓶牛奶走。
So we all asked the customer if he wanted to take a bottle of milk.
说起来，我们开的两家咖啡馆都是在上海的黄金地段上，即使疫情发生，固定成本是不可能减少的，只能临时进行内部调整，做一些补救方案来应对。
In fact, both of our cafes are in prime locations in Shanghai, and even in the event of an outbreak, fixed costs cannot be reduced.
其实有不少人每天都有喝咖啡的需求，但迫于疫情不敢出门，所以今年春节大家对咖啡豆的需求就增加了。
In fact, many people have a daily need for coffee, but due to the epidemic dare not go out, so the demand for coffee beans this Spring Festival increased.
往年春节咖啡馆生意很好，我们主要以照顾店里客人为先，没太多时间烘豆子，而最近基本隔一天就要烘焙一次了。
In the past Spring Festival coffee shop business is very good, we mainly to take care of shop guests first, there is not much time to bake beans, and recently almost every other day will bake.
今年在这方面的效益确实比以前好，但因为快递原因，实际上也只能提供给江浙沪一带的客人。
This year's benefits are indeed better than before, but for express delivery reasons, they are actually only available to guests in Zhejiang and Shanghai.
收入，能补回一部分，但不算多。
Income, can make up a part, but not too much.
有时候想想，幸好我们是自家烘焙，成本更低，还可以有喘口气的机会，不然今年春节就真的要睡不着觉了。
Sometimes, think about it, we're home-baked, cheaper and have a chance to catch our breath, otherwise the Spring Festival might not be able to sleep.
不过，这些压力也促使我沉下心思考如何让月球咖啡在现在的环境里有更多适应性。
However, these pressures have also prompted me to ponder how to make lunar coffee more adaptable in today's environment.
我们以前没有投入特别多的精力在线上运营上面，一直在想怎么在店内给客人提供更好的服务。
We didn't put a lot of effort into online operations before, and we've been thinking about how to provide better service to our customers in the store.
但经过这件事情之后，我想，或许我们还是要多花些精力在线上了，当以后再次遇到这种突发事件时，可以多一个生存机会。
But after this, I think, maybe we should spend more energy on the online, when the next encounter with this kind of emergency, can have an additional chance of survival.
我慢咖啡生活馆 Gaman Cafe类型：咖啡馆 / 店龄：3年 / 店员全职2名，兼职5名“我慢”刚开业的时候就遇上了愚园路修路，时间长达一整年，好不容易缓和过来之后，这一次又因为疫情而选择暂时关店。
(Coffee Shop) (Coffee Shop) (Coffee Shop) (Store Owner) (Coffee Shop) (Store Owner) (Coffee Shop) (Coffee Shop) (Coffee Shop) (Coffee Shop) (Coffee Shop) (Coffee Shop) (Coffee Shop) (Coffee Shop) (Coffee Shop)
生活好像被瞬间按下了暂停键，但房租与人员薪资的账单却没有因此停下来，不久前，店长Molly在朋友圈里写下，“咖啡馆的流水只够撑一个月了”。
Life seemed to be held in abeyance for a while, but the rent and payroll bills didn't stop there. Not long ago, Molly wrote in her friend's circle, "The coffee shop only has enough water for a month."
口述者：Molly“我看到太多人想要开咖啡馆，但是最后又被这个东西牢牢栓住了。
Oral: "I saw too many people trying to open a coffee shop, but in the end they got stuck in it.
”我是经历过非典的人，现在回想起来还是很害怕。
I am a person who has experienced SARS and I am still scared in retrospect.
那时我已经转去四川上学半年多了，爸爸也是在疫情潜伏期之前许久就来看我了，但老师和同学还是因为我们是广东人而要把我们“抓”起来，最后家里人找来各种证明才得以脱身。
I had been transferred to Sichuan for more than half a year, and my father had come to see me long before the epidemic began, but the teachers and classmates wanted to "catch" us because we were Cantonese.
现在我作为一个在上海生活的人，也能理解当初他们面对未知病毒的紧张心情了，但这个创伤永远是没有办法抚平的。
Now, as a person living in Shanghai, I can understand their nervousness about facing the unknown virus, but there is no way to heal the wound.
最近虽然也有别的店在营业，但我个人出于担心，还是决定2月10号之后再开门，不要涉险了，特别当是你的员工和客人有可能因此感染，想想还是挺可怕的。
Although there have been other stores open recently, I personally decided, out of fear, to keep the door open after February 10, especially as your employees and guests might get infected.
而且，店里有小伙伴是坐火车来的，也想要在家自我隔离一段时间。
In addition, there are small partners who came by train, also want to isolate themselves at home for a period of time.
从目前得到的消息来看，大家都没有发热、发病，但是有发福的情况。
From the information available so far, we do not have fever, morbidity, but there is a case of obesity.
我发了一条朋友圈，说“咖啡馆的流水只够撑一个月了”，这的确是事实。
I sent out a circle of friends and said, "There's just enough water in the cafe for a month," and that's a fact.
咖啡馆是靠流水过活的，年前我又送了员工去培训，机器上也有重新维修、保养，当时花了挺多钱。
The coffee shop is living on water, I sent staff to training years ago, machine repair, maintenance, then spent quite a lot of money.
但人总是要想办法的，不能说既然我只能支持一个月了，那就关门算了。
But people always have to do something, can't say since I can only support a month, then close the door.
这家店就像我的宝宝一样，我的员工也需要我按时给他们发工资。
This store is like my baby, and my staff need me to pay them on time.
开一家店，已经不是我一个人的事情了。
Opening a shop is no longer my business.
我开店的大多数的日子，好像都是靠借钱熬下去的。
Most of the time I open a shop, I seem to live on borrowed money.
2018年，我们店铺所在的愚园路修路修了一整年，很影响客流，那一年也是非常难过。
In 2018, the Yue Yuen Road, where our shop is located, was repaired for a whole year, which greatly affected the flow of visitors.
我本来觉得自己是个很坚强的人了，但到了修路的后半期，还是忍不住在店里当着员工的面大哭，打心底里挺绝望的。
I thought I was a very strong man, but in the second half of the road, or in the store in front of staff crying, playing the bottom of my heart quite desperate.
我看过太多人想要开咖啡馆，但是最后又被这个东西牢牢拴住了。
I've seen too many people want to open a coffee shop, but in the end it's firmly tied to this thing.
前段时间我本来有天很低落，就跟一些同行朋友聊天，大家各自说了下自己店里的情况，感觉讲出来之后就好多了，算是难友间的互相安慰吧。
Some time ago I was very low, and some friends chat with the same trade, everyone said their own store, feeling better after the speech, is a difficult friends comfort each other.
相比有些店需要囤很多生鲜或者因为春节滞留了很多员工，我的压力还是小一些。
Compared with some stores need to hoard a lot of fresh or because the Spring Festival stuck a lot of staff, I still less pressure.
这几天不用开店，我就在家刷刷剧、做做饭，可始终没法用一种很放松的心态享受这个“多出来的假期”，生活卡在了这里，停滞不前，账单却没有因此停下来。
These days, I do not open a shop, I brush at home, cooking, but always can not use a very relaxed attitude to enjoy this "extra holidays", life stuck here, stagnating, the bill did not stop.
或许等盛夏的时候会好一些吧，春天本来就是疾病高发的时期。
Maybe it will be better in the middle of summer. Spring is the period of high incidence of diseases.
我已经想好了，开门之后在店外挂一个牌子——“救救孩子吧”，欢迎大家都可以进来喝一杯咖啡。
I've decided to open the door and hang a sign outside the store, "Save the Children," welcoming everyone in for a cup of coffee.
我也希望我的供应商们都能够挺过来，大家一起同舟共济。
I also hope that my suppliers will be able to survive, we are in the same boat.
虽然我也知道3月之后，肯定还是会损失一些战友。
Although I also know that after March, will definitely lose some of his comrades.
OPEN THE MARKET类型：杂货店 / 店龄：1年 / 2人搭档碎花队长和Kya是选品店OPEN THE MARKET的创始人，也是店内唯二的员工。
OPEN THE MARKET TYPE: Grocery / Store Age: 1 / 2 Partner Broken Flower Captain and Kya are the founders and only two employees of OPEN THE MARKET.
她们的店铺开在上海图书馆斜对面，今年大年初五，疫情发展让人心慌，很多店铺都选择延期开业，但碎花队长和Kya还是没有改变原计划，依然复工。
Their shops, sloping across from the Shanghai Library, were frantic in the early part of the year, with many shops opting to delay opening, but Captain Flower and Kya did not change their plans and went back to work.
在营业第一天，甚至还拍下了一个Vlog，自嘲一般记录了店外空无一人的街道。
On the first day of business, I even took a Vlog and laughed at myself for recording the empty street outside.
口述者：碎花队长口述者：Kya“当你发现可以立马上手的事微乎其微时，心态就会放平和许多。
Oral: Head Shredder Oral: Kya When you find that there is little you can do right away, there is a lot of peace of mind
”我们还是按照初五复工的原计划开了门，当时就是抱着玩乐的心态，反正在家也闲不住。
We went back to work in accordance with the original plan of the fifth day of the door, then is holding a playful mentality, anyway, at home.
复工的第一周，每天接待的客人也就4、5个，大多还是外国人。
During the first week of work, we received four or five guests a day, most of them foreigners.
相对于我们，他们接收到的信息没有那么密集，戒备心也没那么重。
They receive less intense information than we do, and are less alert.
在这样的时期，很多店铺面临的问题都是一样的，只是各家承受的轻重不同罢了。
In this period, many shops face the same problems, but the weight of each is only different.
我们两人都在上海，没有其它员工。
Both of us are in Shanghai and have no other employees.
店铺里大多卖的是文创、服饰等，不存在保质期短的问题。
Shops are mostly selling literary creation, clothing and so on, there is no short shelf life of the problem.
需要负担的成本最重的就是房租了。
The heaviest cost to bear is the rent.
大家最终还是要恢复到生活的正轨上，所以我们开着店铺也并不一定是件坏事，反而说不定会对路过的人带来一些积极的影响。
In the end, we're going to get back on track, so it's not necessarily a bad thing for us to open a shop, but it may have a positive effect on those who pass by.
不过，这几天来店里营业是假，两个人想见面、互相讨论店铺安排是真。
However, the store business these days is a fake, two people want to meet and discuss shop arrangements is true.
我们一直在研究大家的消费需求，从开店到现在，店内的产品结构一直在调整。
We have been studying the consumer demand, from the store to now, the product structure in the shop has been adjusted.
当疫情过去之后，客人在心态、习惯上多多少少都会有一些改变，这两天我们就在店里模拟消费者可能存在的心态会有哪些，在这种突发性情况下我们应该备什么货。
When the epidemic is over, there will be some change in the mindset and habits of our customers. We will be in the store these two days to simulate what kind of mentality consumers might have, and what we should be stocking up for in such a sudden situation.
当然，有很多事情会暂时被搁置，比如原先开春后会有很多迎合季节的上新计划。
Of course, a lot of things will be put on hold for a while, such as the spring after the original will have a lot of new plans to cater for the season.
我们之前做过一个调查，发现客人对我们自己的原创设计还是抱有很大期待，所以现在在考虑是不是要把所有时间投入到这上面。
We've done a bit of research before and found that our guests still have big expectations for our original design, so we're wondering if we should devote all our time to it.
在线上运营的部分，我们不想只是把店里现有的产品放到线上卖，但会想在线上做一些有趣的内容，而不是单纯的销售。
We don't want to just sell what we have online, but we want to do something interesting online, not just sell it.
大家呆在家里那么久了，肯定是会想要往外跑的，这都是阶段性的。
Everybody stays at home so long, is sure to want to run out, this is the stage.
况且，我们做线上这件事需要付出的精力和运营线下店是一样的，当你把指针往那边偏过去后，那线下店的魅力一定会有所折扣。
Moreover, we need to do this line of work with the same energy as the offline shop, when you tilt the hands that way, the charm of the offline shop is bound to be reduced.
举一个例子，这两年电影院的生意为什么会变得那么好。
Take, for example, why cinema business has become so good these two years.
2000年DVD出来的时候很多人都在追捧，但人还是要跟人社交啊，线下的小店依然有它存在的价值，就看你可以做到什么程度，比线上单纯销售之外能够提供的东西有多少了。
When the DVD came out in 2000, many people were after it, but people still have to socialize. The store under the line still has its value, depending on how far you can go and how much more you can offer than online sales alone.
我们是家选品店，开店这一年多时间里，我们一直在想到底是要选自己喜欢的还是大家会喜欢的？最后发现，好像一直在做的都是前者。
We are a choice shop, the shop has been open for more than a year, we have been wondering whether to choose their favorite or everyone will like it? Finally, it seems that has been done is the former.
只有你相信它，才会有信心推荐给信赖你的那群人，这或许也是选品店存在的意义吧。
Only if you believe in it can you confidently recommend it to the people who trust you, which may be the significance of the store of choice.
过去我们没有做太多社交网络上的经营，只通过微信群和大家互动，但经过这件事之后，我们想要在线上有更多关于自己态度和观点的表达了。
In the past, we didn't do much on social networking and only interacted with people through micro-messaging groups, but after that, we wanted to have more online expression of our attitudes and opinions.
