02.02.2020本文字数：1995，阅读时长大约3.5分钟导读：随着送检加快，黄冈今天确诊病例还将继续大增，但医药物资短缺等客观形势下，防控形势十分严峻。
With the acceleration of medical examination, the number of confirmed cases in Huanggang will continue to increase greatly today, but under objective circumstances such as shortage of medical supplies, the situation of prevention and control is very serious.
作者 | 第一财经陈益刊紧邻武汉的湖北省黄冈市，新型肺炎确诊病例飙升至1002例，在全国仅次于武汉。
New cases of pneumonia have soared to 1,002, second only to Wuhan in China, just outside Wuhan's Huanggang city in Hubei province.
针对黄冈严峻的疫情形势，湖北省省长王晓东曾公开表示，“我们绝不能让黄冈成为第二个武汉”。
"We must not allow Huanggang to become the second Wuhan," said Wang Xiaodong, governor of Huanggang province.
现状：确诊人数飙升、医药物资紧缺“现在黄冈的疫情非常严峻。
Status: The number of confirmed cases has soared and medical supplies are in short supply.
”2月1日，黄冈市市长邱丽新在湖北省召开新型肺炎疫情防控工作新闻发布会上说。
Huanggang Mayor Qiu Lixin told a news conference in Hubei province on February 1 to prevent and control the new pneumonia epidemic.
1月21日，黄冈首次确诊新型肺炎12例，此后逐步增加突破1000例，而且确诊病例还会继续增加。
On January 21, 12 new cases of pneumonia were first diagnosed in Huanggang. Since then, more than 1,000 cases have been diagnosed, and the number of confirmed cases will increase.
湖北省卫健委最新数据显示，2月1日黄冈大幅新增276例新型肺炎病例，截至2月1日24时黄冈累计有新型肺炎1002例，首次突破千例，在湖北省内仅次于武汉（4109例），占全省确诊病例比重达到了11%。
According to the latest data, 276 new cases of pneumonia were newly reported in Huanggang on February 1, with 1,002 new cases accumulated in Huanggang as of 2400 on February 1, the first time a thousand cases were recorded, ranking second only to Wuhan (4,109) in Hubei Province, accounting for 11 percent of confirmed cases in the province.
其中死亡15例。
Of these, 15 were killed.
为何昨日确诊病例大增？邱丽新在上述发布会上表示，2月1号和2号两天我们现存的1000多例疑似病例很快就会检测完毕，在这1000多例中可能有很大比例是确诊病例，所以可能1号和2号两天黄冈的确诊病例还会有大幅度的提升。
The first two days of February 1 and February 2 will soon see the completion of more than 1,000 suspected cases, of which a large proportion may be confirmed cases, so there may be a substantial increase in confirmed cases on days 1 and 2, Qiu said at the press conference.
除了确诊病例快速增加，医药物资十分紧缺。
In addition to the rapid increase in confirmed cases, medical supplies are in short supply.
“我现在睁开眼第一件事，就是想怎么搞到一次性医用防护服，我们这边只有一天的库存，没有这个医院开不了门。
"The first thing I'm opening my eyes is trying to get a disposable medical suit. We only have a one-day inventory here, and no hospital is open.
一次性医用防护服消耗量大，这个现在最急缺，采购都来不及，也没货了。
Disposable medical protective clothing consumption is large, this is the most urgent need, procurement is too late, also out of stock.
”黄冈市黄州区总医院一位负责采购的人士在电话里告诉第一财经。
A person in charge of procurement at Huangzhou General Hospital in Huanggang City told First Finance on the phone.
黄州区总医院由当地17家医疗机构组建而成。
The Huangzhou General Hospital is made up of 17 local medical institutions.
“由于没有一次性防护服，我们医护人员只能穿着雨衣上阵。
"Without disposable protective clothing, our paramedics had to wear raincoats.
N95口罩需求量大，也基本断货。
N95 masks are in high demand and largely out of stock.
”黄冈市蕲春县李时珍医院一位工作人员告诉记者。
A staff member of the Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon County told reporters.
黄冈武穴市第一人民医院工作人员告诉第一财经，医院防护服快用完了，N95口罩也不够，估计维持不了两三天。
Huanggang Wuquan City First People's Hospital staff told First Finance, hospital protective clothing is running out, the N95 mask is not enough, estimated to last two or three days.
邱丽新表示，医药物资紧缺是黄冈现在面临的最着急、最揪心、最突出的问题。
Qiu Lixin said that the shortage of medical supplies is now the most anxious, most worried, the most prominent problem facing Huang Gang.
一线医务人员要进病区，最急缺就是医用防护服、N95口罩、药品等。
First-line medical personnel to enter the sick area, the most urgent need is medical protective clothing, N95 mask, medicine, etc.
原因：巨大人员流动、防控不到位为何黄冈成为新型肺炎重灾区，确诊病例剧增？黄冈是仅次于武汉的第二人口大市，紧临武汉，走高速公路仅需一个小时，黄冈和武汉有城际铁路，半小时可以到达。
Huanggang is the second most populous city after Wuhan, just an hour by expressway, and Huanggang and Wuhan have an intercity railway, which can be reached in half an hour.
在黄冈封城之前，大概有60万到70万人由武汉返回，巨大人员流动客观上对防控带来非常大的压力。
Before the city was closed in Huanggang, some 600,000 to 700,000 people returned from Wuhan, and the huge movement of people objectively put a great deal of pressure on control.
受春节和疫情影响，500万人离开武汉。
Five million people left Wuhan due to the Spring Festival and the outbreak.
根据百度地图慧眼的迁徙大数据，1月10日至22日六七成武汉人前往湖北省内其他城市，其中黄冈和孝感位居前两位，这导致这两个地区新型肺炎病例较多。
Wuhan people traveled to other cities in Hubei Province from January 10 to 22, with Huanggang and Xiaogan ranking second, leading to more new cases of pneumonia in the two areas, according to big migration figures from Baidu's map.
随着确诊速度加快，大量疑似病例快速确诊，导致确诊病例大幅增加。
As the rate of diagnosis accelerates, a large number of suspected cases are rapidly diagnosed, leading to a significant increase in confirmed cases.
邱丽新在发布会上坦陈，前期我们也是对新型冠状病毒认知不足，准备也不充分，干部重视不够，导致防控工作存在短板和弱项。
Qiu Lixin admitted in the press conference, we are also the new coronavirus awareness, preparation is not enough, cadres pay insufficient attention, leading to the prevention and control of shortcomings and weaknesses.
“我们医疗救治能力仍然不足，虽然我们改扩建一批集中救治场所，但因为时间很紧，启用比较滞后，部分定点医疗机构分类分区不到位，存在交叉感染风险。
"Our medical treatment capacity is still inadequate, although we have rebuilt and expanded a number of centralized treatment sites, but because of time constraints, the use of lags behind, some designated medical institutions classification is not in place, there is a risk of cross-infection.
另外医疗物资和药品特别医用防护服和N95口罩、面罩、护目镜严重不足。
There is also a serious shortage of medical supplies and medicines, in particular medical protective clothing and N95 masks, masks and goggles.
”邱丽新说。
'she said.
她表示，农村的疫情防控也很薄弱，人员排查没有做到全覆盖，部分群众防护的意识还不强，个别还有出来走动、聚集、打牌现象。
She said that the rural epidemic prevention and control is also very weak, not full coverage of personnel screening, some people are not strong awareness of protection, there are individual walking, gathering, card phenomenon.
同时乡村医护力量也严重不足，包括防护设施和防护手段比较少。
At the same time, rural medical care is also seriously inadequate, including protection facilities and relatively few means of protection.
1月29日，中央赴湖北指导组督查组到黄冈市了解当地疫情防控情况和疑似病例检测工作。
On January 29, the central government went to Huanggang city to learn about local epidemic prevention and control and the detection of suspected cases.
当地卫健委主任却一问三不知。
The local health committee director did not know.
“督查组在黄冈发现这些问题，确实充分曝露出来我们在应对疫情方面，应该说不充分，包括防控措施不严，部分干部的作风不实，所以对此我们确实感到非常内疚和非常自责。
"The surveillance team found these problems in Huanggang and we really felt very guilty and very remorseful when we said that we were not dealing with the epidemic adequately, including lax control measures and the dishonesty of some cadres.
”邱丽新在上述发布会说。
"Qiu Lixin said at the launch.
问责、防范升级补短板针对疫情防控中干部工作不力的情况，黄冈加快问责。
Accountability, prevention and upgrading of the board targeted at the lack of work of cadres in disease prevention and control, Huang Gang to accelerate accountability.
邱丽新介绍，黄冈市各级纪检监察机关累计出动了3497人次开展监察检查，检查重点部位和场所6416处，处理、处分党员干部337人，对防控工作不利的6名领导干部予以免职，其中3名是正县级干部，还有3名是乡镇的党政主要领导。
The city's disciplinary and supervisory organs at all levels have dispatched 3,497 people to conduct inspections, 6,416 inspections of key sites and sites, handled and disciplined 337 Party cadres, and dismissed six leading cadres, three of whom were full-time county cadres, and three of whom were leading Party and government leaders, according to Qiu Lixin.
比如黄冈市卫生健康委员会主任唐志红被免职。
Tang Zhihong, director of the Huanggang Health Commission, was dismissed.
除了问责，针对现有问题，疫病防控不断升级。
In addition to accountability, disease control has been escalating in response to existing problems.
黄冈早在1月24日开始封城，措施不断升级，内防扩散，外防输出。
Huang Gang as early as January 24 began to close the city, measures continue to upgrade, internal non-proliferation, external defense output.
2月1日发文加强市区人员出行管控，严格控制市区居民出行。
February 1 issued a letter to strengthen the movement control of urban residents, strictly control the movement of urban residents.
每户家庭每两天可指派1名家庭成员上街采购生活物资，其他人员除生病就医、疫情防控工作需要、在商超和药店上班外，不得外出。
Every two days, a family member may be assigned to the streets to purchase household goods, while others may not go out except for medical treatment, disease prevention and control, work in commercial supermarkets and pharmacies.
黄冈展开地毯式开展联防联控，17万名党员投身防疫一线，及时发现发热病人4726人，及时转院，诊断治疗。
Huang Gang unfolded carpet joint control, 170,000 Party members joined the epidemic prevention front, timely detection of hot patients 4726, timely referral hospital, diagnosis and treatment.
为了弥补床位不足的短板，黄冈通过加快改建、扩建、征用等举措完成4200张床位，确保有能力应收尽收，应治尽治。
To make up for the shortage of beds, Huang Gang has completed 4,200 beds by speeding up reconstruction, expansion and requisition to ensure he has the capacity to collect as many beds as possible and to cure them.
比如为了解决市区救治能力不足，紧急将大别山医疗中心改建为集中救治医院，可新增床位1000张。
For example, in order to solve the problem of inadequate treatment capacity in urban areas, the Dabie Mountain Medical Center was urgently converted into a centralized treatment hospital with 1,000 beds.
黄冈对确诊病例、疑似病例，还有隔离留观的病人、发热病人这四类人群，施行分区收治，加强管理，避免交叉感染，解决病人排队长秩序乱等问题。
Huanggang in the confirmed cases, suspected cases, but also isolated patients, febrile patients these four groups of people, regional admission, strengthen management, to avoid cross-infection, to solve patients queuing up disorder and other issues.
尽管湖北省紧急向黄冈调配医药物资、社会捐赠增多、黄冈加大采购医药物资，但目前黄冈医药物资依然紧缺。
Although Hubei Province has urgently deployed medical materials to Huanggang, social donations have increased and Huang Gang has increased the procurement of medical supplies, there is still a shortage of medical supplies in Huanggang.
对此黄冈将最紧缺物资投向定点医疗机构。
Huanggang will be the most scarce supplies to targeted medical institutions.
“我们也希望多渠道采取措施，无论捐赠也好，还是给我们帮助联系渠道采购也好，我们全力以赴把（医药物资采购）这项工作做好。
"We also want to do a lot of things, whether it's giving money or helping us with our procurement through channels," he said.
