这一天，微博平台上有关新冠肺炎患者的求助信息清零了。
On this day, the help message on the microblogging platform regarding the new crown pneumonia patient is zero.
作者 | 第一财经胥会云北京小汤山医院启用后不久，SARS迎来了拐点。
Not long after the start of the Peking Xiaotangshan Hospital, SARS reached an inflection point.
如果理解小汤山对于2003年的意义，就能明白被誉为“武汉版小汤山”的火神山以及雷神山，承载着怎样的期待。
If you understand the significance of Xiaotangshan for the year 2003, you can understand what kind of expectations are being carried by the mountain of the god of fire, known as Wuhan Edition of Xiaotangshan, and the mountain of thunder.
这是武汉试图逆转“一床难求”的开始，希望从步步被动的局面，从之前的“人等床”转为“床等人”的主动。
This is Wuhan trying to reverse the "one bed difficult" start, hope that the situation from the passive step by step, from the previous "people wait for the bed" to "bed and other people" initiative.
但回头来看这个进程颇为不易。
But looking back at the process is not easy.
非常时刻需非常之举。
Extraordinary times are called for.
在疫情防控进入“最吃劲的关键阶段”，2月13日，湖北武汉同时换帅。
In the prevention and control of the epidemic into "the most strenuous critical phase," February 13, Hubei Wuhan at the same time change Shuai.
十余天来，武汉战疫打法变了吗？执行到位了吗？形势改观了吗？“床要等人”1月28日，全国31个省(区、市)新冠肺炎确诊病例达5974例，超过2003年的SARS。
Over the past ten days, Wuhan battle epidemic changed? Execution in place? The situation has changed? "The bed to wait for people" January 28, 31 provinces (districts, cities) New Crown Pneumonia confirmed cases reached 5974, surpassing the 2003 SARS.
此后数字迅速攀升，让人意识到，火神山、雷山神并不是终级答案。
Since then, the numbers have skyrocketed, making it clear that Mount Fire and Mount Lei are not the ultimate answers.
仅在2月3日，武汉市新增确诊1242例，超过了火神山的床位数。
On Feb. 3 alone, Wuhan City added 1242 new cases, more than the number of beds in Mount Fujimori.
▲2月8日，一辆转运确诊患者的救护车抵达武汉火神山医院。
February 8, a transporter confirmed the patient's ambulance arrived in Wuhan fire god mountain hospital.
因为医院没有床位，不能及时做核酸检测，大量确诊、疑似患者无法收治，造成的结果，一是成为“移动的传染源”，发生严重的交叉感染，尤其是家庭聚集性感染；一是加速患者的病程演化，从轻症拖成了重症，导致武汉重症、危重症病例比例居高不下。
Because the hospital does not have beds, can not promptly do nucleic acid tests, a large number of diagnosed, suspected patients can not be admitted, the result is a "mobile source of infection," serious cross-infection, especially family-based infection; and accelerated the evolution of patients from mild to severe disease, resulting in a high proportion of serious, critical cases in Wuhan.
中央指导组成员、国务院副秘书长丁向阳2月20日在武汉举行的新闻发布会上说，这场突如其来的疫情，是新中国成立以来的一场非常战“役”，病毒来势之凶，疫情传播之烈，范围扩散之广，全社会所面临的挑战和压力之大，应该说堪称是前所未有。
'The sudden outbreak of the epidemic is an extraordinary war 'since the founding of New China,' said Mr. Ding Xiangyang, a member of the Central Steering Committee and Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council.
对于1月27日之后的情况，丁向阳说，从报告的新增病例情况看，应该说湖北武汉的疫情出现了大流行，呈现点状、局部地区的爆发和多点多地的大面积多发。
Regarding the situation after January 27, Mr. Ding said from the newly reported cases, it should be said that the situation in Wuhan, Hubei Province, has become a pandemic, with outbreaks in spots, local areas and a large number of outbreaks in large areas.
中国疾病预防控制中心新型冠状病毒肺炎应急响应机制流行病学组进行的一项流行病学研究显示，截至2月11日中国内地报告的44672个确诊病例，73.1%的发病时间在1月份。
An epidemiological study conducted by the Epidemiology Unit of the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Mechanism of the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that as of February 11, 44,672 confirmed cases had been reported in the Mainland of China, with 73.1% occurring in January.
尤其是在1月24~28日达到第一个流行峰，并在2月1日出现单日发病日异常高值。
In particular, the first epidemic peak was reached on January 24-28, with an unusually high number of one-day morbidities on February 1.
从报告日来看，报告病例是在差不多10天之后的2月5日达到流行峰，之后相对高位并缓慢下降。
From the reporting date, the number of reported cases peaked on 5 February, almost 10 days later, and has since been relatively high and slowly declining.
“湖北武汉出现了大量的患者，床位严重不足，群众住不上院，救治工作的压力非常大，我们心急如焚。
"Wuhan, Hubei Province, a large number of patients, seriously inadequate beds, the masses can not live in the upper house, the pressure of treatment is very large, we are anxious.
”丁向阳20日说。
"said Ding Xiangyang on the 20th.
增加床位的任务，首先指向医院。
The task of increasing the number of beds begins with the hospital.
武汉持续增加定点医院，同时将普通病房改造为适用于收治传染病人的隔离病房。
Wuhan has continuously increased the number of designated hospitals, while general wards have been transformed into isolation wards for patients with infectious diseases.
但是，“改造病房的速度不仅有赖施工进度，更取决于呼吸配套的急救设备等医疗物资的到位速度。
However, "the speed of the renovation of the ward depends not only on the construction schedule, but also on the speed of arrival of medical supplies such as emergency equipment.
”一家定点医院的医生说。
"said a doctor at a designated hospital.
持续的医疗物资“紧平衡”，影响了“应收尽收、应治尽治”的推进。
The continuous "tight balance" of medical supplies has affected the promotion of "all-receivable, all-cure".
另一个问题是，武汉的病床周转率非常低。
Another problem is that the turnover of beds in Wuhan is very low.
2月4日，国家卫健委医政医管局副局长焦雅辉公布的数据是：湖北之外的全国出院患者平均住院日为9天多，而湖北省患者平均住院日为20天。
On February 4, the deputy director of the National Health and Wellness Commission, Jiao Yahui, announced that the average number of hospital days discharged from hospitals outside Hubei was more than nine days, compared with the average of 20 days for patients in Hubei Province.
床位不足，叠加低周转率，使得武汉现有病床的实际效用又打了折扣。
The shortage of beds and the low turnover rate added together have reduced the actual utility of the existing beds in Wuhan.
“应收尽收、应治尽治”在现有的医院层面，无法解决。
"Receivable, should cure" in the existing hospital level, can not be resolved.
大空间、多床位的方舱医院，是逆转武汉形势的重要一招。
Large space, multi-bed cabin hospital, is an important way to reverse the situation in Wuhan.
中国工程院副院长、中国医学科学院院长王辰在接受媒体采访时说，迅速把确诊的轻症病人都收治起来，避免造成新的传染至关重要，建设“方舱医院”对当前疫情防控具有重要意义。
In an interview with the media, Wang Chen, vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that it was important to treat all confirmed mild cases quickly so as to avoid new infections.
2月3日晚，武汉连夜开建洪山体育馆、武汉客厅、武汉国际会展中心三所“方舱医院”。
On the night of February 3, Wuhan Hung Shan Stadium, Wuhan living room, Wuhan International Convention and Exhibition Center, three "cabin hospitals.
4日上午，又宣布在光谷科技会展中心、武汉体育中心、武汉国际博览中心等地再建三家“方舱医院”。
On the morning of the 4th, it was announced that three more "cabin hospitals" would be built in Guanggu Science and Technology Exhibition Center, Wuhan Sports Center and Wuhan International Expo Center.
2月5日晚10点，位于武汉国际会展中心的江汉方舱医院率先启用。
February 5th at 10: 00 pm, Wuhan International Convention and Exhibition Center, JiangHan Square Hospital opened the first.
2月6日一早，48岁的武汉市民凌宏（化名）住了进来。
Early on February 6, the 48-year-old Wuhan city of Min Ling Hong (not his real name) came in.
“住进来还是放心一些了。
"It's a little easier to live in.
”凌宏是轻症患者，他基本不发烧，但觉得呼吸困难，乏力。
Ling Hong is a mild case of fever, but he feels shortness of breath and weakness.
2月3日确诊后一直在家隔离。
Isolated at home since her diagnosis on 3 February.
尽管入住之初遇到了一些不便，但很快，方舱医院上了轨道，开始良性运转，凌宏也在慢慢康复。
Although the initial check-in encountered some inconvenience, but soon, the cabin hospital on the track, began benign operation, Ling Hong is also slowly recovering.
之后，方舱医院持续加码。
After that, the cabin hospital continued to encode.
国家发展改革委2月16日宣布，继续安排中央预算内投资2.3亿元，支持武汉市方舱医院完善设施、增添必要的医疗设备，增强方舱医院收治能力。
The National Development and Reform Commission announced on February 16 that it would continue to allocate 230 million yuan from the central budget to support the Wuhan Fangzhou Hospital in improving its facilities, adding necessary medical equipment and enhancing the hospital's treatment capacity.
同时，全国大量的医护支援而至。
At the same time, there was considerable medical support throughout the country.
截至2月20日，累计251支医疗队32446人援助武汉，其中73支医疗队8220人援助方舱医院，178支医疗队24226人援助定点医院。
As of February 20, a total of 251 medical teams had assisted Wuhan, including 73 medical teams with 8,220 personnel and 178 medical teams with 24,226 personnel in designated hospitals.
武汉统筹解决床位问题的办法，是“两增一改造”——增加定点医院，增加方舱医院；将具备条件的集中隔离点改造成为隔离治疗点。
Wuhan co-ordinated solution to the bed problem, is "two plus one transformation" - to increase the number of designated hospitals, to increase the number of square cabin hospitals; to improve the conditions of centralized isolation points into isolated treatment points.
2月21日，武汉市委常委、常务副市长胡亚波说，针对新增患者仍然比较多的现状，中央指导组带领省市成立了资源专班，提出了“3318”的工作目标，也就是到2月25日，通过征收、扩容和改造等方式，实现定点医院储备床位3万张、方舱医院储备床位3万张、隔离治疗点的储备床位1万张和隔离点储备床位8万张的目标。
On February 21, Wuhan Municipal Committee Standing Committee, Deputy Mayor Hu Yapo, said the central guidance group led provinces and municipalities in setting up resource classes to meet the target of 30,000 hospital beds in designated hospitals, 30,000 beds in the Fang Cao Hospital, 10,000 beds in the reserve beds of quarantine sites and 80,000 places in the reserve beds of the quarantine stations by February 25.
这15万张床位，希望守住武汉“床等人”的底线。
These 150, 000 beds, hope to keep Wuhan "bed and so on" the bottom line.
底数之难随着“床等人”的逐步实现，以及对病毒认识的逐步深入，治疗方案的不断优化，武汉的疫情出现了一些积极变化：每天新增的确诊病例数，回落到2月21日的314例；疑似人数下降到927例；新增出院人数则增加到了21日的992例。
With the gradual realization of the "bed and others," as well as the gradual deepening of the understanding of the virus, treatment plans continue to optimize some positive changes in Wuhan: the number of new confirmed cases per day, fell to 314 on February 21; the number of suspected cases dropped to 927; and the number of new discharges increased to 992 on 21 days.
而且，2月20日、21日两天，新增出院人数，超出了新增确诊病例数。
Moreover, on 20 and 21 February, the number of new discharges exceeded the number of newly confirmed cases.
▲武汉2月单日新增确诊和新增出院病例“总体上看，湖北、武汉疫情从过去的爆发式增长已经走向趋缓，如果防控措施落实到位，下降的趋势不会改变，从前期的最高点开始逐步下行。
Wuhan February 1 a new diagnosis and new discharge cases "in general, Hubei, Wuhan epidemic from the past explosive growth has slowed down, if the control measures in place, the downward trend will not change, starting from the previous peak gradually downward.
”丁向阳说。
"said Ding Xiangyang.
但是，拐点并没有到来，武汉的形势依然严峻。
However, the inflection point did not arrive, Wuhan's situation is still grim.
从防控的角度，武汉需要彻底控制传染源，切断传播路径；从救治的角度，武汉的确诊病例基数很大，且重症和危重症患者比例高。
From the point of view of prevention and control, Wuhan needs to thoroughly control the source of infection, cut off the transmission path; from the point of view of treatment, Wuhan has a large confirmed case base, and a high proportion of serious and critically ill patients.
截至2月21日，武汉市现有确诊病例36680例，其中危重2087例，重症7468例，合计占比26%。
As of February 21, there were 36,680 confirmed cases in Wuhan, of which 2,087 were critical and 7,468 were severe, accounting for 26 per cent of the total.
“要防止轻症转为重症，防止重症转为危重症，这是当前的重中之重。
"It is a top priority to prevent the progression from mild to severe," he said.
”丁向阳说。
"said Ding Xiangyang.
而要解决这个问题，不仅仅是应收尽收，应治尽治，还有一个关键点，是应早尽早。
To solve this problem, not only receivable, should cure, but also a key point, should be as early as possible.
流行性传染病的防控有三把刀——控制传染源、切断传播途径、保护易感人群。
The prevention and control of epidemic diseases has three knives - controlling the source of infection, cutting off transmission routes, and protecting vulnerable populations.
只有每把刀都落到实处，才有可能以最快的速度控制住它的流行。
Only when every knife is in place will it be possible to control its popularity as quickly as possible.
但在封城之后，武汉在三把刀上都呈现了力有不逮的局面。
However, after the closure of the city, Wuhan in the three knives are presented on the force of the situation.
不能在第一时间发现传染源、控制传染源的唯一后果，就是疫情进一步蔓延。
The only consequence of not finding the source of infection in the first place and controlling the source of infection is the further spread of the epidemic.
要做到应早尽早，武汉必须对疫情基础信息有准确把握。
To achieve as early as possible, Wuhan must have accurate grasp of the basic information of the epidemic situation.
2月20日，中央指导组副组长、中央政法委秘书长陈一新来到武汉市公安局疫情防控总指挥部、新闻舆情中心、执法监管平台督导疫情防控工作。
On February 20, Chen Xinxin, vice-chairman of the Central Steering Group and Secretary-General of the Central Political Science and Justice Commission, came to the General Command of Disease Control, Press Center and Law Enforcement Supervision and Control Platform of Wuhan Public Security Bureau.
他说，打好武汉保卫战，首先要搞清楚“统计对象”——确诊、疑似、发热、密切接触人群的真实数据是多少？从数据出发倒推，防控趋势变化如何？未来走向在哪？千万不能是“脚踩西瓜皮，滑到哪里算哪里”。
He said, to play the defense of Wuhan, first of all, to understand the "statistical object" - diagnosis, suspected, feverish, close contact with people? From the data, how the trend of control change? Where the future? Do not be "foot on watermelon skin, slide where it is."
陈一新指出，做好疫情防控，底数不清、进度不明，就会很被动，甚至就会打败战。
Chen Xin pointed out that good disease prevention and control, bottomless, unclear progress, will be very passive, or even defeat the war.
底数不清、进度不明，这也使得SARS期间形成的有效经验，包括属地化管理、分类管理等，在武汉一度并未起到作用。
The innumerable, uncertain progress also makes the effective experience formed during SARS period, including belonging to the management, classification management, etc. did not play a role in Wuhan at one time.
为了摸清底数，武汉采取的措施之一，就是调整疑似和诊断标准，让传染源变得显性。
In order to find out the bottom, Wuhan to take one of the measures is to adjust the suspected and diagnostic criteria, so that the source of infection become dominant.
2月5日，《新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎诊疗方案（试行第五版）》公布，其中的改变，一是放宽了湖北的疑似病例标准，一是在病例诊断分类中，在“疑似病例”和“确诊病例”之间增加了“临床诊断”。
On February 5, the SARS Diagnosis and Treatment Programme for New Coronavirus Infection (Trial Version 5) was announced. The changes include relaxing the criteria for suspected cases in Hubei Province and adding a "clinical diagnosis" between "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" in the case diagnosis classification.
国家医疗专家组成员、北京地坛医院感染性疾病诊疗与研究中心首席专家李兴旺回应称，目的是为了早期发现病人，早期诊断、早期隔离治疗。
Li Chengzheng, a member of the National Medical Experts Group and chief expert at the Infectious Diseases Clinic and Research Center of Ditan Hospital in Beijing, said the goal was to identify patients early, diagnose early and isolate treatment.
这一变化，直接导致2月12日的数字甫一出炉就引发了众人惊愕。
This change caused consternation as soon as the figures of February 12 appeared.
当天，武汉新增病例13436例（含临床诊断病例12364例）。
On the same day, Wuhan registered 13,436 new cases (including 12,364 clinical cases).
不过，从流行病学的专业角度而言，有公共卫生专家也告诉记者，这个数据并不意味着疫情的进一步蔓延，而是意味着：湖北的新冠肺炎疫情，正式走入了防控的核心——控制所有传染源、切断传播路径。
However, from the professional point of view of epidemiology, some public health experts also told reporters, the data does not mean the further spread of the epidemic, but means that the Hubei New Crown Pneumonia epidemic, the control of all sources of infection, cut off the transmission route.
此时，武汉封城已20天。
At this time, Wuhan has been closed for 20 days.
但真正做到这一点，是对武汉疫情发起总攻的一个根本前提。
But to really do this is a fundamental prerequisite for launching a general offensive against the Wuhan epidemic.
新官到任武汉摸清底数的工作，依然显得困难重重。
The new official arrived in Wuhan to find out the number of work, still appears difficult.
早在1月24日，武汉就提出全面进入“战时”状态，落实分级分类就医制度，确保发热病人得到及时救治。
As early as January 24, Wuhan put forward a comprehensive "wartime" state, the implementation of a classification of medical treatment system to ensure that febrile patients receive timely treatment.
2月2日，武汉市新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎防控指挥部要求，2月2日12点前，各城区要完成对确诊患者集中收治、疑似患者集中隔离，无法排除的发热患者和确诊患者的密切接触者集中隔离观察，新增人员“日清月结”。
February 2, Wuhan City, the new coronavirus infection of the Pneumonia Command requirements, February 2, 12, to complete the diagnosis of patients concentrated treatment, suspected patients in concentrated isolation, can not exclude febrile patients and confirmed patients in close contact with closely observed, the new personnel.
一次次的提出目标，也意味着上一次的部署可能并未达成目标。
Setting goals over and over again also means that the previous deployment may not have met its objectives.
丁向阳说，大约在2月8日、9日，武汉要求发起决战，开展总攻。
Around February 8 and 9, Wuhan demanded a decisive battle and a general offensive, Mr. Ding said.
中央指导组要求湖北省和武汉市开展拉网式排查，不落一户、不漏一人，把患者及时送到医院、方舱医院，及时给予治疗，发现的密切接触者进行隔离观察。
The Central Steering Group requested Hubei Province and Wuhan City to conduct a pull-in screening, do not drop a house, do not leak a person, the patients promptly sent to hospitals, cabin hospitals, timely treatment, found close contacts for isolation observation.
时任武汉市委书记马国强说，截至2月9日，一共排查了3371个社区村，按户数算排查了421万户1059万人，户数排查的百分比达到98.6%，人数排查百分比达到99%。
As of February 9, 3,371 community villages had been checked, with 4.21 million households counted and 10.59 million checked, with 98.6 percent of the households counted and 99 percent counted, according to then-Wuhan party secretary Ma Guoqiang.
截至2月10日中午，排查发现的1499名新冠肺炎重症确诊患者已全部入院，武汉将争取在11日完成所有疑似患者的检测清零。
By noon on February 10, 1,499 patients diagnosed with severe pneumonia had been admitted to the hospital, and Wuhan will try to complete the detection of all suspected patients by February 11.
这一组数据备受质疑，不少网友调侃自己就刚好属于1%。
This set of data has been questioned, many netizens ridicule oneself just belong to 1%.
此时，微博上“住院难”的求助信息仍有不少。
At this point, Weibo on the "hospitalization difficulties" of the help information is still quite a few.
第一财经记者就持续接到来自武汉市武昌区黄鹤楼脚下西厂口社区居民高女士的求助，称自己82岁的奶奶冯翼纯老人2月8日CT确诊双肺感染且又经2月11日核酸检测呈阳性后，一直未能被医院收治。
The first financial reporter continued to receive help from Ms. Gao, a resident of Xichangkou community at the foot of the Yellow Crane Tower in Wuchang, Wuhan City. He said his 82-year-old grandmother, Feng Yongjun, was diagnosed with two lung infections on February 8 and tested positive for nucleic acid on February 11.
直到2月13日下午4时许，高女士在电话中说，冯翼纯老人终于被武汉市定点医院收治。
Until about 4 p.m. on February 13, Ms. Gao said by telephone that Feng Yongchun was finally admitted to Wuhan Ding Hospital.
多个案例都表明，这一轮的“应收尽收”以及排查工作，完成的并不好。
A number of cases show that this round of "receivable" and inventory work, the completion is not good.
2月12日，对于疫情防控，有了一个新的判断——到了最吃劲的关键阶段。
On February 12, there was a new diagnosis of the epidemic's prevention and control - to its most demanding and critical phase.
这个阶段的策略也非常清晰：湖北和武汉是疫情防控的重中之重，是打赢疫情防控阻击战的决胜之地。
The strategy for this phase is also clear: Hubei and Wuhan are the top priorities for epidemic prevention and control and the decisive place to win the battle against the disease.
此时，湖北换帅。
At this time, Hubei chang Shuai.
2月13日，湖北以及武汉走“马”换“蒋”，原上海市市长应勇接任湖北省委委员、常委、书记，原济南市委书记王忠林接任湖北省委委员、常委和武汉市委书记。
On February 13, Hubei and Wuhan exchanged "horses" for "Chiang." The former mayor of Shanghai should take over as member, standing committee member and secretary of Hubei Provincial Committee, and former secretary of Jinan Municipal Party committee Wang Zhonglin took over as member of the Hubei Provincial Committee, Standing Committee member and Wuhan Municipal Party Secretary.
▲应勇调任湖北省委书记两位曾长期任职于政法系统的官员，接掌了疫情核心。
Yingyong transferred to Hubei Provincial Communist Party secretary two long-serving officials in the political and legal system, took over the core of the epidemic.
2月15日，新任武汉市委书记王忠林在武汉市新冠肺炎疫情指挥部视频调度会上，直陈发现的问题，指出一些小区防控流于形式，有些地方拉网式排查大而化之，排查态度不坚决，措施不严密，网眼太大。
On February 15, the new Wuhan party secretary Wang Zhonglin at the Wuhan Xinguan Pneumonia Epidemiology Command Video Discovery of the problem, pointed out that some small area control in the form of a formal, some places pull the screen large-scale inspection, not resolute, loose measures, too large mesh.
随后，“全覆盖、拉网式”大排查再度展开，王忠林说，“我们等不了、拖不起、慢不得！”按照要求，此次大排查要落实五个“百分之百”：确诊患者百分之百应收尽收、疑似患者百分之百核酸检测、发热病人百分之百进行检测、密切接触者百分之百隔离、小区村庄百分之百实行24小时封闭管理。
"We can't wait, we can't afford it, we can't wait, we can't afford it, we can't wait, we can't afford it," Wang said. He was asked to implement five "100 percent": 100 percent receivable from confirmed patients, 100 percent suspected nucleic acid testing, 100 percent testing of febrile patients, 100 percent isolation of close contacts, and 100 percent 24-hour closure of small villages.
“不漏一户、不掉一人”的要求再度提出，且2月17日到2月19日的3天内必须保证以上人员全部收治到位，实现清零。
"Do not leave a house, do not drop a person" request again, and February 17 to February 19 3 days must ensure that all the above-mentioned personnel in place, achieve zero.
曾经自我调侃为1%的武汉人，终于陆续接到了社区的排查电话，或被社区工作人员敲开了家门。
Wuhan people, who once ridiculed themselves as 1 per cent, finally received calls from the community or were knocked out of their homes by community workers.
▲2月18日，青山区工人村街道青和居社区居民接受排查。
February 18, Qingshan workers village street youth and residential community residents were screened.
2月18日晚，第一财经记者接到了家住江汉区新华路附近的刘女士求助，她的父亲80多岁，在福利院感染确诊新冠肺炎，生命危急，医院和社区“让我们等”，一直没有何时能住院的消息”，家人焦急万分。
On the night of Feb. 18, the first financial reporter received help from Ms. Liu, who lives near Xinhua Road in the Jianghan District. Her father is in his 80s, his life is in danger, the hospital and the community "let us wait" and there has been no news of hospitalization.
2月19日，刘女士告诉记者，救护车已经将父亲送往定点医院救治。
On February 19, Ms. Liu told reporters that the ambulance had taken her father to a designated hospital for treatment.
“这次是真的应收尽收，不漏一人了”。
"This is a real receivable, no one left behind."
2月19日，也是应勇、王忠林履新一周的日子。
February 19, also Yingyong, Wang Zhonglin took up the new week.
这一天，微博平台上有关新冠肺炎患者的求助信息清零了。
