我担心的是英国人遏制不住向往自由心， 不少的英国人依然我行我素，四处溜达、遛狗、遛球、遛娃。
My worry is that the British can't help but yearn for freedom. Many Britons still go their own way, wandering around, walking their dogs, walking the ball, or taking walks.
文 |小　麻“什么？我现在在英国？病毒？中国有病毒？全球都有病毒？我怕是在做梦吧？”三周前我参加了一场当地足球赛，摔倒在地，头被撞了一下短暂失忆后醒来，脑子里是上面那些反应。
What? Am I in the UK now? Viruses in China? Viruses all over the world? I'm afraid it's a dream? "I fell to the ground three weeks ago and woke up with a brief memory loss.
可惜，那不是一场噩梦。
Unfortunately, it wasn't a nightmare.
我是一名“老”留学生，以前在国内留学教育培训机构里当老师。
I am an "old" international student who used to be a teacher at an educational and training institution in China.
大学毕业17年后，我又当学生了，算是实现人生梦想吧。
After 17 years of college, I became a student again, which is the realization of my life dream.
2019年9月，我带着女儿和老婆到英国，开始英伦三岛深造的日子。
In September 2019, I took my daughter and wife to England to begin my further education on the British Isles.
然而，看来我的求学愿望再次被病毒诅咒——17年前大学毕业时我遇到的是非典。
It seems, however, that my desire to learn was once again cursed by the virus - SARS that confronted me when I graduated from college 17 years ago.
中国疫情？上帝保佑！但离我们很远我们在布里斯托的郊区住。
An epidemic in China? God bless you! But far from us we live in the suburbs of Bristol.
度过了最早的适应期，我和这边的同学变熟悉了，女儿麻花也送去了幼儿园， 我们开始认识很多当地人，固定参加一些本地聚会， 社交生活慢慢走上正轨，娱乐生活也渐渐丰富多彩。
After the earliest period of adaptation, my classmates and I became familiar with each other, my daughter sent to kindergarten, we began to know a lot of local people, fixed to attend some local parties, social life slowly on track, entertainment life gradually colorful.
第一次在海外过春节，却听到了祖国遭受新冠病毒威胁的坏消息。
The first Spring Festival overseas, but heard the motherland is threatened by the new crown virus bad news.
十分担心国内的疫情，挂念国内的亲人和朋友。
Worried about the epidemic at home, about the family and friends at home.
我准备买口罩寄到国内，没想到收到卖方电话，英国对口罩实施禁运政策（各种原因复杂），我网上买的几千个口罩都被延期发货了。
I was about to buy a mask to send to China, but I did not expect to receive the seller's phone call, the UK's embargo policy on masks (for a variety of reasons), thousands of masks I bought online were delayed.
怀着无比复杂的心情，只能默默祈祷疫情早日过去。
With a very complex mood, can only silently pray that the epidemic will soon be over.
好在国内的政策给力，一切慢慢变好。
Fortunately, the domestic policy force, everything slowly become better.
TOOLSATION网站上的口罩都已售罄， 只剩呼吸器国内疫情紧张的二月，英国已经有数例输入性病例，我和英国人聊天，大家对中国表示担心，但很多人感觉病毒和自己的生活很遥远，大街上没有任何人戴口罩，也没有歧视中国留学生的事件，整体生活环境对中国人还是很友好的， 麻花幼儿园老师的亲切笑脸， 英国当地邻居的热情好客，都让我们暂时忘掉了不安。
With all the masks sold out on the TOOLSATON website, except for the Breathing Machine in February, when there were several imported cases in the UK and I talked to the British and expressed concern about China. But many felt the virus and their lives were remote.
邻居小姑娘Yvie和麻花偶尔会有几个英国老头问我怎么看这个病毒，他们会不会有危险， 我告诉他们需要特别小心，因为病毒尤其对老年人很不友好， 他们笑答：“没啥好怕， 老天自有安排”。
I told them I needed to be very careful, because the virus was particularly unfriendly to the elderly. They laughed and said, "Nothing to fear, God has it."
到英国病例开始增加到数百， 我所在城市也开始有病例出现的二月底，依然没有任何人戴口罩， 各种party， 学校聚会， 夜场到了凌晨也人满为患，排队的小年轻们都排到了门外几十米远。
By the end of February, when cases began to appear in my city, no one was wearing masks, parties, school parties, evening parties, and the line of young people lined up at the door for tens of meters.
因为瑞典环保愤怒小妹格蕾塔桑伯格来到了布里斯托，2月28日这里举行了三万人的大游行，现场可谓人山人海、群情激昂啊，我躲在远处, 无可奈何。
Because Sweden's angry environmental sister Greta Samberg came to Bristol, February 28 held a 30,000-person parade, the scene is a sea of people, passionate ah, I hide in the distance, helpless.
发生歧视中国留学生事件到了三月，欧洲国家防中国、防韩国、防伊朗，却没想到自家的后院着了大火， 病毒很快在浪漫奔放的意大利肆虐，并以迅雷不及掩耳之势席卷英国。
Discrimination against Chinese students By March, European countries were defending China, South Korea and Iran when a fire broke out in their backyard and the virus quickly spread through romantic Italy and swept over the UK.
针对中国留学生的歧视事件开始出现并增加，我在某种程度能理解外国人的害怕， 但害怕不等于歧视。
Discrimination against Chinese students is beginning to appear and increase, and I understand foreigners' fears to some extent, but fear does not amount to discrimination.
很多外国人不敢在公交车上挨着中国留学生坐，如果中国人戴上口罩， 就有各种奇葩人士前来挑衅。
Many foreigners dare not sit next to Chinese students on buses. If Chinese wear masks, people from all walks of life will come to provoke them.
前几天，有外国人对着戴口罩的中国留学生故意大声咳嗽， 被我这个同学一阵怒骂。
A few days ago, some foreigners wearing masks on the Chinese students deliberately loud cough, I was a classmate of angry scolding.
意大利旅游回来的大量英国人测试呈阳性，英国人终于开始接受病毒来到身边的事实。
A large number of Britons returning from a trip to Italy tested positive and the British finally began to accept the fact that the virus had come to them.
随后约翰逊首相提出了“全员免疫” 的策略。
Then Prime Minister Johnson proposed a strategy of "full immunization."
我询问当地英国人，包括英国的医生， 他们对此的态度居然是认可！惊了我的三观。
I asked the local Englishmen, including the English doctors, how they were going to accept it! It startled me.
我果断在三月初就给孩子请假不再去幼儿园，尽管幼儿园老师一再强调“请尽快送来， 学校是安全的， 长期不来学校影响将来的入学记录”，但在我眼里， 她们那温柔的呼喊声，热情的招手却如同“寂静岭”般诡异。
I decided to take leave of absence from kindergarten in early March, even though the kindergarten teacher insisted that "Please send it as soon as possible. The school is safe and prolonged absence from school will affect the future school record." But to me, their gentle shouts and warm beckons are like Silent Hill.
随着“全员免疫”政策在国内外媒体的发酵，这里的留学生如同惊弓之鸟， 微信群里的同学们纷纷惊慌了， 很多同学开始准备逃回国内躲避。
With the "full immunization" policy in the domestic and foreign media fermentation, the students here like a startled bird, micro-letter groups of students panic, many students began to prepare to flee back to the country to take refuge.
我在冷静思考后选择不回国，并做好了长期留守的准备。
I chose not to return home after thinking calmly, and was ready to stay for a long time.
一是因为十七年前非典“跑毒”的悲催经历依然历历在目，二是回国路上危险重重， 三是不想回去给国内添乱。
One is that 17 years ago SARS "run poison" of the tragic experience is still vivid, the second is to return to the country on the many dangers, and third, do not want to return to the domestic chaos.
囤货、停业、保持距离既然做好了长期留守的准备， 我们决定立刻出门囤货，这时出门外面的气氛已经大为不同， 超市里的货物居然很多都被抢购一空， 尤其是鸡蛋、 面包、卫生纸三样极为枪手。
Now that we were ready to stay for the long haul, we decided to stock up immediately. The atmosphere outside was so different that many of the items in the supermarket were snapped up, especially eggs, bread and toilet paper.
鸡蛋面包可以理解，但是抢卫生纸是什么鬼？！病毒来了所以排泄更多吗？牛奶只剩全脂的、英国人很少人喝全脂牛奶面包货架空了罐头和能长期保存的意大利面最为抢手长盒的鸡蛋最便宜， 一早就没有了， 剩下的只有四个装的高端鸡蛋， 因为贵， 没多少人买一大早去超市门外排队抢归抢， 这时候能看出不列颠人民整体素质还是挺高的，之前媒体报道了一个故事，有老人到超市什么必须物资都买不到，这家超市决定，每天早上第一个小时的时间, 只为老人开放。
What the hell is a toilet paper?! When the virus comes, does it excrete more? Milk is full fat. Very few people in Britain drink full-fat milk bread shelves. There are only four high-end eggs left.
这张令人心酸照片引起了英国对老年人的同情大街上人少了很多， 但是依然没有人戴口罩。
This poignant photograph has caused much less sympathy for the elderly in Britain, but still no one is wearing a mask.
接下来英国政府采取特别严厉的措施来抵抗病毒， 学校、酒吧、餐厅、酒店、大型活动全部停止了，在“你们可能会失去心爱的人” 和“全国60%的人都会感染” 口号震撼下的英国人， 这下全都老实在家待着了。
Schools, bars, restaurants, hotels, big events have all come to a halt, and Britons, shaken by the slogan "You may lose someone you love" and "60 per cent of the population will be infected," are staying at home.
昨晚， 英国政府再次颁布最新的工资补助措施，不管是否非法移民， 全部免费诊治。
Last night, the British government again announced the latest wage subsidies, whether illegal immigrants or not, all free treatment.
英国真的严阵以待了！闹市区大街上几乎没人坐巴士的乘客少了很多， 偶尔能看到英国人戴起了口罩在药店外排队的顾客保持安全距离酒店都已关门， 寒风中萧瑟对于在英国留守的生活，我现在基本不担心。
There are far fewer passengers on downtown streets who hardly ever take a bus. Occasionally I can see Britons wearing masks and queuing outside pharmacies to stay safe. Hotels are closed.
英国当地的超市虽然会卖断货，但是早上早点去都能买到物资， 食品生产部门是不会停工的； 之前买的二手车派上了大用场， 一周出去采购一次就够了；我们住在村里， 人口密集度很低。
Local supermarkets in the UK sell out, but supplies are available early in the morning and the food-production sector does not stop; used cars bought before are so useful that we go out shopping once a week; we live in a village with a very low population density.
我担心的是英国人遏制不住向往自由心， 不少的英国人依然我行我素，四处溜达、遛狗、遛球、遛娃。
My worry is that the British can't help but yearn for freedom. Many Britons still go their own way, wandering around, walking their dogs, walking the ball, or taking walks.
我更怕我的邻居， 之前邻居家的小女孩爱上了来我家，每逢周末都要来我家串门。
I was even more afraid of my neighbor, who had fallen in love with me and visited my house every weekend.
