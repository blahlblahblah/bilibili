燃财经（ID:rancaijing）原创作者 | 赵磊编辑 | 周昶帆病毒是如何感染患者的？疫情是怎么发生的？家庭聚集性感染为何容易发生？戴口罩和勤洗手到底管不管用？在新冠肺炎疫情期间，这些能引发所有人求知欲望的问题，被一条叫做《关于新冠肺炎的一切》的视频回答了，在10分18秒中，视频用精致的动画、详实的数据和被掰开揉碎的高深论文，让所有人都看懂了专业医学术语之下的疫情发生始末，同时为观众提供了有理有据的防护建议。
How did Cho Lei, the original creator of Fun Finance (ID: Rancaijing), infect patients? How did the outbreak occur? Why do family-focused infections occur easily? Wearing masks and washing hands often doesn't work? In 10 minutes and 18 seconds, a video called Everything About Coronary Pneumonia showed everyone the details of the outbreak.
回形针，这个早在2017年就开始制作知识科普视频的自媒体，因为这条视频迎来高光时刻，《关于新冠肺炎的一切》在全网累计播放量超1.5亿，为回形针带来500多万的新增粉丝，而在这条视频之前，回形针全网粉丝量大约为800万，靠着一百多条科普视频积累起来。
The clip, which started making popular science videos as early as 2017, is a high-powered video with more than 150 million cumulative hits across the network and more than 5 million new fans for paper clips, up from about 8 million fans on more than 100 popular science videos.
快速增加的粉丝使成立两年多的回形针迅速扭亏为盈，2019年营收近600万，主要来源于广告定制，背后的原因是观众变多了，客户也多了，更高的流量支撑了回形针的广告溢价，也能让他们在内容上有更多话语权，筛选出那些他们认可的产品。
The fast-growing number of fans has helped turn the two-year-old paper clips back into profit, with close to 6 million in 2019, driven largely by ad customization, driven by a larger audience and more customers, with higher traffic supporting the advertising premium for paper clips and giving them a greater say in content and sifting through products they approve.
图/ 回形针长期以来，知识科普类内容由于受众群体少、创作门槛高、商业化困难，一直以来都不温不火，大部分情况下，知识科普是由专业科学机构和专业科普人士推动的，还有一部分凭借兴趣坚持的个人创作者。
Chart / Paper Clips Knowledge-based popular science content has long been tepid due to its small audience, high creative threshold and difficulty in commercialization. In most cases, it is driven by professional scientific institutions and professional populists, and partly by individual creators who cling to their interests.
但在近两年，短视频成为普及度最高的内容媒介，知识科普类内容也适应形势，在创作上、传播上做了很多适应性调整，在各大平台的支持下，逐渐成为一门重要的内容品类。
However, in the past two years, short video has become the most popular content media, knowledge and popular science content has adapted to the situation, made many adaptations in creation and dissemination, and gradually became an important content category with the support of major platforms.
在此次疫情期间，由于公众对专业、权威信息的需求爆发，知识科普类内容也迎来了一个非常好的发展机会。
During this epidemic, due to the public demand for professional, authoritative information, the knowledge of popular science content also ushered in a very good opportunity for development.
“算是一个小爆发，尤其是医学类相关的科普，其他类型的科普也因为疫情影响正在被更多人看到，整体来说，在目前这种到处充斥着信息杂音的环境下，理性、专业、严谨的知识科普内容会有更多市场空间。
"It's a small outbreak, especially the medical-related science popularization, and other types of popular science are being seen by more people because of the epidemic's impact. Overall, there is more room for rational, professional and rigorous intellectual and scientific content in the current environment of information noise.
”某MCN机构CEO余越对燃财经说。
Yu Yue, CEO of an MCN group, told Flaming Finance.
与此同时，知识科普类内容依然面临着留存困难和变现困难两大问题，部分行业人士认为，知识科普内容只是短期爆发，比如医学类内容，长期来看不会有普遍持续的内容需求，相比娱乐内容，不同领域的硬核知识目前还不是刚需，在流量变现上依旧难以达到娱乐内容的效果，而知识付费的模式目前依然无法走通，需要更多的探索尝试。
At the same time, the content of popular science of knowledge still faces two problems: it is difficult to retain and hard to realize. Some industry people think that the content of knowledge is short-term, such as medical content, there will not be a general and continuous demand for content.
更强的品牌效应，更高的广告溢价，知识科普内容还要继续抓好这个优势，积蓄力量等待更好的商业机会。
Stronger brand effect, higher advertising premium, knowledge and popular science content to continue to grasp this advantage, gather strength waiting for better business opportunities.
疫情之下，知识爆发回形针的主理人吴松磊压根儿就没想到这条视频能有如此广泛的传播量，视频发布的那几天，正是疫情焦灼之时，法定假期延长，每天好几千的新增病例，舆论场上各路声音交杂在一起，这样一条严肃理性甚至稍微有点乏味的科普视频，却出人意料成为了刷屏爆款。
Wu Song Lei, director of the paper clip for the outbreak of knowledge, did not expect the video to reach such a wide audience. The release of the video comes just days after the epidemic, when the official holidays were extended, thousands of new cases were recorded every day, and a serious, rational, and even slightly bland, video of the popular science was surprisingly blacked out.
知识科普内容的严肃性，造就其较高的接受门槛，回形针是一个典型，表现出高信息密度、严肃、硬核甚至枯燥的内容特点。
The seriousness of the general content of knowledge makes it a high acceptance threshold. Paper clips are typical of high information density, seriousness, hardcore and even boring content.
吴松磊曾经说过，回形针做内容的追求是，“我们在讲清楚一个话题后，你找不到一个讲得更清楚的视频。
Wu Song Lei once said that the paper clip's pursuit of content is, "We have a clear topic, you can not find a clearer video.
”在这个理念下，丰富的信息增量成为《关于新冠肺炎的一切》最重要的成功原因。
In this sense, the wealth of information increments has become the most important success story for "Everything About New Crown Pneumonia."
“用户对于科普内容的需求很明确，就是要弄清楚一件事情或者找到解决一个问题的方法，说清楚了，这个视频就是成功的。
"The user's need for popular science content is clear, to figure out what's going on or how to solve a problem, and to be clear, this video is successful.
”余越说。
"said Yu.
这种对于问题答案的求索，成了疫情期间大众最直接的需求，从戴口罩的正确方法到N95与普通医用外科口罩的区别，从病毒如何才能被杀死到究竟哪种药物能治疗新冠病毒，从粪口传播是什么到气溶胶传播是什么，诸多问题在全网求解和扩散，各路专家对疫情的解读视频也在微博、抖音、快手等平台广泛传播。
This quest for answers has become the most immediate public demand during the epidemic, from the right way to wear a mask to the difference between N95 and general medical surgical masks, from how the virus can be killed to which drugs treat the new crown virus, from what is spread from manure to aerosol transmission.
《王辰院士解答新冠病毒是否会与人类长期共存》，援鄂护士剃头引发关注后，《病毒会在头发上滞留吗？》，以及张文宏医生的18分钟公开课《让流感病毒不再肆虐，你必须知道的真相》都在各平台达到千万级的播放量。
Academician Wang Chen answered whether the new crown virus will live with humans for a long time, "Does the virus stay in the hair after a shaving of nurses in E E," and Dr. Zhang's 18-minute public class "Let the influenza virus stop, the truth you have to know" all reach a million levels across platforms.
做短视频矩阵号的王盟感受很深，疫情期间，他们团队会将各类专家解读视频剪辑成短视频，往往只需要一两个吸引人的点，在各大平台上的传播量都十分惊人，“尤其是终南山院士的采访，每次都是上百万的播放量”。
During the outbreak, the team interpreted video clips into short video clips, often requiring only one or two compelling points and a staggering amount of traffic on major platforms. "Especially in the case of the Tennessee Academicians, there are millions of broadcasts at a time."
B站肺炎解读专题页面 图 / 36氪衍生开来的相关科普内容也受到关注，比如对传染病、免疫系统等医学知识的科普，对疫情会如何影响宏观经济等财经知识的科普，对酒精、消毒水等日常防护品的用法科普等等，用户要求内容兼顾专业性和实用性，而为了传播效果，通俗易懂也成了一个要求。
The popular science of infectious diseases, immune system and other medical knowledge, popular science of how the epidemic affects macro-economic and other financial knowledge, the use of alcohol, disinfectant, and other daily protective products, has become a requirement for both professionalism and practicality, and easy-to-understand for communication purposes.
“最明显的一点是，以前做知识科普内容你要做得很有趣，那才会有人看，现在不用了，只要你能把一个问题有理有据地说明白，观众能看懂，点击、转发、留言就不会差，如果再做得有趣一点，很容易就成为爆款。
"The most obvious thing is that you have to do a lot of knowledge to make it interesting, and then people will see it. Now you don't have to, as long as you can put a reasonable case, the audience can understand, click, forward, leave a message, if more interesting, it could easily become a bomb.
”B站一位科普类up主告诉燃财经。
[B] a popular science-type leader told Flaming Finance.
除了对疫情和医疗相关知识感兴趣外，宅在家的用户也在通过互联网学习更多的技能，这对于泛知识类的内容来说也是一项利好，如电脑技术、金融理财、烹饪教学、外语听说等，在疫情持续期间都有一定的数据上涨。
In addition to their interest in the epidemic and health-related knowledge, homebound users are learning more skills via the Internet, which is also good for pan-knowledge content, such as computer technology, financial management, cooking teaching, and foreign language listening and speaking, all of which have experienced some data increases over the course of the epidemic.
“知识科普类内容确实迎来了一个集中爆发期，但这是阶段性的，在疫情结束后大概率还是会回归正常的水平，但也有积极意义，比如医疗防护知识的普及等，这也正是科普本身的价值。
"It is true that there has been a period of concentrated explosion in the popular science of knowledge, but it is a gradual process and the probability will return to normal after the outbreak, but it is also positive, such as the spread of knowledge about medical protection, which is the value of the science itself.
”余越说。
"said Yu.
知识科普蓄力已久早在2012年，一档名为《飞碟说》的科普类视频节目就得到广泛的好评。
As early as 2012, a popular science video program called "Flying saucer theory" was widely acclaimed.
《飞碟说》用诙谐幽默的语言和简单易懂的动画形式将一些知识拆解后输出给观众，其口号是“知识从未如此性感”，主要播放平台还是优酷、搜狐、爱奇艺等长视频平台。
"Flying saucer" uses humorous language and simple and easy-to-understand animation to export some of its knowledge to audiences, with the slogan "Knowledge has never been so sexy" and the main broadcast platforms are Youku, Sohu and Aki.
以现在的眼光看，《飞碟说》的“短”和“轻”两个特点较突出，在欢乐中获取知识，有利于传播，但离严格意义上的科普还有一段距离，而到了回形针这样的硬核科普，也能达到如此惊人的传播效果，说明受众对知识科普内容的接受度一直在提高。
From the point of view of the present, the "short" and "light" characteristics of "flying saucer" are more prominent, in joy to acquire knowledge, conducive to dissemination, but from the strict sense of the popular science, but to paper paper, such a hard-core science can achieve such amazing dissemination effect, indicating that the audience has been increasing the acceptance of the knowledge of popular science content.
科普内容短视频化和短视频平台成为最重要的流量渠道，二者共同构成了知识科普类内容快速发展的基础。
Short video and short video platform of popular science become the most important flow channels, which together form the basis of the rapid development of popular science content.
2019年以来，知识科普类内容逐渐成为抖音上最受欢迎的创作主题之一。
Since 2019, the popular science content of knowledge has gradually become one of the most popular themes in chattering.
来自字节跳动的数据显示，抖音平台上粉丝超过1万的科普创作者在2019年前6个月增长了767%，共发布了超过132万条科普类短视频，累计播放量超过1678亿。
Data from byte jumps show that popular science creators with more than 10,000 fans on the jitter platform grew by 767% in the first six months of 2019, releasing more than 1.32 million popular science videos with a cumulative audience of more than 167.8 billion.
与一般文字、图片、网站等科普形式相比，短视频科普更生动、更直观、更有趣，符合移动互联网时代知识碎片化传播的市场偏好和观众需求。
Short video science is more vivid, intuitive, and interesting than popular forms of popular science, such as text, pictures, and websites. It is in line with market preferences and audience demand for the fragmentation of knowledge in the mobile Internet age.
中国科学院院士匡廷云表示，随着多媒体信息平台的问世，科普手段必然发生一场巨大的变革。
Chinese Academy of Sciences academician Kuang Tingyun said that with the advent of multimedia information platform, the means of popular science will inevitably undergo a great change.
短视频科普的大背景是用户将短视频作为重要的信息获取渠道时对内容的要求持续提升，知识科普则是信息价值体现较好的一个领域，为此，平台方也积极开展了对知识科普类创作者的扶持。
The background of short video science popularization is that the user needs the content continuously to improve when taking the short video as the important information access channel, the knowledge science popularization is one domain which the information value manifests well, therefore, the platform also actively promotes the knowledge science popularization creator.
去年3月抖音推出“DOU知计划”，为科普内容创作者率先开通5分钟视频权限；去年11月快手联合知乎推出“快知计划”，通过流量扶持、品牌共创等利好政策鼓励更多知识生产者，促进知识类型创作者结合短视频、直播平台和图文知识平台的优势，探索知识传播的多样化形态；去年年底，B站推出“好奇心计划”，专门针对知识领域的up主开放申请认证，鼓励科普视频创作。
Last March, DU launched the DOU Awareness Program, the first of its kind for popular science content creators to open up five minutes of video permission. Last November, Speedpost jointly announced its "Quick Notice Program" to encourage more knowledge producers through good policies such as traffic support and brand co-creation.
在这些扶持下，各大平台也孵化出一些优质的原生创作者，比如快手上的“水果医生”。
Under these supports, the major platforms also incubate some high-quality original creators, such as the fast-hand "fruit doctor."
通过给水果做手术的方式讲解一些手术流程和基础医学知识，这个三甲医院重症医学科主治医师利用业余时间拍视频，初衷是想让他儿子做医生，给儿子做展示，2018年9月发了第一期视频，反响很不错。
By performing surgery on fruit to explain some of the procedures and basic medical knowledge, the Sanja Hospital's intensive care physician used his spare time to produce videos intended for his son to be a doctor and show his son. The first video, released in September 2018, was very well received.
水果医生培养了孩子的动手能力和颜色辨识能力，但也帮助了不少观众。
Fruit doctors develop a child's hands-on and color-recognition skills, but they also help many viewers.
在他的视频评论区和直播间里经常会有观众向他请教医学上的问题，他会针对情况给一些简单建议，通过观摩给水果做手术演示，很多人消除了环境恐惧，知道自己的手术是怎么做的，让很多人有了治疗的勇气。
In his video comments section and studio, people often ask him for medical advice. He gives simple advice about the situation. By observing fruit, many people remove their environmental fears, know how their surgery is done, and give many people the courage to treat them.
图 / 水果医生快手账号“在医学科普上，我比较了解观众的心态，当我没有疾病的时候我对疾病并不感兴趣，所以目前大幅增长的科普需求在疫情过去后会下降一些，以我的视频为例，如果你做的手术和大众关系密切，他们都会喜欢，但如果是什么膝关节置换、脊柱椎间盘置换这类手术，虽然你很努力去模仿，自己很喜欢，但大众不喜欢。
Picture / Fruit Doctor Fast Track Account "On the medical science page, I understand the audience's mentality. I'm not interested in disease when I'm not sick, so the current surge in popular science demand will decrease after the outbreak.
‘’水果医生对燃财经表示。
The fruit doctor told Flaming Finance.
他认为科普视频贴近生活很重要，要去平衡专业性和普及性，被更多人看到还是第一位的。
He believes that popular science video close to life is very important, to balance professionalism and popularity, more people see it is the first.
目前水果医生已经可以通过做科普视频这个副业在快手上获取一定的收入，一部分来源于付费课程，另一部分来源于直播打赏，还有一部分是直播带货。
Fruit doctors are now able to make a quick buck by doing the sideline of popular science videos, partly through paid courses, partly through live shows and partly through live deliveries.
付费课程方面，水果医生以每套一元的价格上线了一套急救课程，演示心肺复苏、海姆立克急救，或者家里出现急性心肌梗死、脑出血、脑梗死时第一时间该怎么做。
For paid courses, fruit doctors take a first aid course for $1 a set, demonstrating CPR, Heimlich first aid, or what to do in the first place when an acute myocardial infarction, cerebral hemorrhage, or cerebral infarction occurs at home.
“一块钱也没有真的把它当成什么收入，因为生活中确实会有很多悲剧，这些方法在国外都很普及，以后我也会推出更多的对大众有用的课程。
"I don't really think of a dollar as an income, because there will be a lot of tragedies in life, these methods are very popular abroad, and I will introduce more courses for the public.
”但水果医生没有把拍视频做科普发展为主业的想法，他只想做好医生本职工作的同时去做一件比较有意义的事情，同时还能获得一些额外收入。
But the fruit doctor didn't think of making videos as a career in popular science -- he wanted to do a good job as a doctor while doing something meaningful and earning some extra income.
像他一样将兴趣爱好发展为副业的知识科普内容创作者还有很多，比起专业的机构创作者，这些个人创作者的商业化更多依赖平台，要根据自己的内容调性和平台的内容商业生态去选择合适的商业化路径。
There are many other intellectual creators of popular science content who, like him, develop their interests into sidelines, relying more on platforms for commercialization than on professional creators to choose the right path to commercialization, depending on their content tone and the commercial ecology of the platform's content.
科普也得谈钱“以前之所以只有科研机构和科学家才去做一些科普的工作，还是因为这件事本身的回报是比较小的，好内容要获得好的回报，这个道理大家都懂，但科普就是很容易费力不讨好，不过现在整体会好一些，商业化的手段更丰富，大家更愿意去做。
Science is all about money. "Before, only scientific institutions and scientists did some popular science work, or because the rewards for good content were small, but popular science is easy to swallow, but now the whole is better, the means of commercialization are richer, and people are more willing to do it.
”余越表示。
Mr Yu said.
比起水果医生这样的个人创作者，机构创作者才能真正将知识科普类内容精品化和规模化，优质科普类内容的视频制作门槛和专业化的视觉呈现效果会不断提高，在兼具专业知识的同时还要兼顾受众的视听喜好，视频的制作难度加大，技术成本、人力成本也越来越高。
Compared with individual creators such as fruit doctors, institutional creators can truly refine and scale up the popular science content of knowledge. The threshold and professional visual presentation of high-quality popular science content will continue to improve. The production of video will be more difficult, and the cost of technology and manpower will be higher.
这些都需要资金支持，如果高质量的内容无法换回相应的商业收入，知识科普内容的发展就会停滞，靠优质内容吸引更多用户、靠更多用户增加收入、将更多收入投入到内容制作的飞轮就无法运转起来。
All of this requires financial support, and if high-quality content cannot be exchanged for corresponding commercial revenues, the development of popular intellectual content will stagnate, and flywheels that rely on high-quality content to attract more users, increase revenue from more users and invest more revenue in content production will not work.
因此，找到合适的商业化路径是每个知识科普类内容创作者的首要任务。
Therefore, finding the right commercialization path is the primary task of every knowledge content creator.
目前对个人创作者来说，熟悉平台的内容生态，了解用户喜好的同时，可以利用平台的优惠政策和商业模式更高效地变现，以水果医生为例，他目前的主要收入都和快手的主要商业模式绑定，比如通过快手课堂内容付费平台推出付费课程，以及直播中的打赏和带货两种收入，但没有广告。
For individual creators, familiarity with the platform's content ecology and understanding of user preferences can be combined with a more efficient realisation of the platform's preferential policies and business models. In the case of fruit doctors, his current main revenues are tied to fast-moving business models, such as paying for courses through the Express Classroom Content Paid Platform, and receiving rewards and delivery live, but not advertised.
由于快手自身的社区社交属性，他的粉丝对他有较强的信任，付费课程、打赏、带货都受益于这种信任关系，虽然他粉丝量并不算多，但依然能获得较可观的收入，这样的腰部创作者在快手的运营理念下会获得不错的成长。
Thanks to his social nature, his fans have a strong faith in him. Fee-paying courses, rewards, and delivery all benefit from this trust, and while his fan base is small, he still earns a decent income, and the lumbar creator will thrive on the idea of a quick hand.
相应的，以精品内容、爆款内容为核心的机构创作者，在抖音这样的强媒体属性平台上可以通过商业广告获得收入，通过爆款内容和持续的内容输出维持高流量，争取更高的广告溢价。
Correspondingly, the creators of organizations that focus on fine content and explosive content can earn revenue through commercial advertising on strong media attribute platforms such as dithering, maintaining high traffic through explosive content and sustained content output, and striving for higher advertising premiums.
以回形针为例，2018年团队亏损47.5万，2019年团队扩张，内容输出力度加大，除去场地、人力等运营成本，不仅赚回了2018年亏损的资金，还净赚了135万，主要就是通过广告植入或为品牌制作视频获得收入。
Take paper clips, for example, which lost 475,000 dollars in 2018, expanded teams and expanded content output in 2019. Excluding operating costs such as space and manpower, it not only recouped 2018 losses, but also made a net gain of $1.35 million, mainly through advertising or video-making for brands.
回形针开设了“回形针事务所”，实现了流程化的广告定制服务。
Paper clip opened a "paper clip office", to streamline the flow of advertising customization services.
吴松磊认为，相比在好看的内容上附加广告，不如直接把广告做好看，所以回形针事务所会直接研究来自客户的具体产品，把听不懂的陌生技术讲清楚，这样的模式必定需要高投入和高回报，而不是知识付费这样的以量取胜。
Wu believes that it is better to look directly at advertisements than at good content, so paper clips look directly at specific products from customers and articulate unfamiliar technologies that do not understand. Such a model necessarily requires more investment and higher returns than a pay-for-knowledge model.
图 /视觉中国此外，知识科普类内容由于其天然的专业性和可信度，在内容电商方面存在较强的带货能力，通过短视频内容的全网传播，不断树立自己在垂直领域的专业形象，与粉丝建立深度关系，从而实现高度信任和消费转化。
Graphic / Visual China In addition, due to its natural professionalism and credibility, the popular knowledge content has a strong ability to carry goods in content electronic commerce. Through short-video content spread across the network, it will constantly establish its professional image in the vertical domain and establish deep relationship with fans, thus achieving a high degree of trust and consumption transformation.
总体来说，知识科普类内容在变现上依然逃不出内容变现的已有模式，内容付费、广告、直播打赏、电商带货，未来随着用户对知识科普内容的认知度和接受度提升，商业潜力会被进一步挖掘出来，但是从另一个角度看，科普可以提高用户的知识素养，传递正确专业的信息，其本身的价值就是无法完全用上商业估量的。
Generally speaking, the popular knowledge content can not escape the existing mode of content realization, content payment, advertising, live viewing, electronic commerce and goods, the future will be further explore as users of the knowledge of popular knowledge and acceptance of the content, but from another point of view, users can improve the knowledge literacy, the transmission of the correct professional information, its value is not fully commercial estimates.
谁能知道，买水果医生一元急救课的五千多个老铁，会不会有人因此挽救一些生命呢？*题图来源于Pexels。
