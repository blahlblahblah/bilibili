随着新冠肺炎疫情在国内持续蔓延，韩国餐饮与电影行业均受到了较大冲击。
With the outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia continues to spread in the country, Korea's catering and film industries have been greatly impacted.
据韩联社报道，餐饮行业首当其冲，顾客减幅逼近六成；电影行业方面，观影人数已创下16年来最低水平，仍有50多部作品尚未敲定具体上线日期。

由于疫情以大邱市和庆尚北道为中心迅速扩散，引发市民不安从而纷纷避免外出，韩国多家电影发行商都已推迟了新片的上映日期。
South Korean film distributors have delayed the release of new films because of the rapid spread of the epidemic around Daegu and Gyeongshan North Province, sparking unrest among citizens and preventing them from going out.
据韩国电影振兴委员会电影票综合电算网4日发布的数据，前一日观影人数仅为59895人次，创下16年来最低水平。

More than 50 films, due to hit cinema screens between March and April, have yet to be scheduled for release, and some are considering postponing their release until the second half of the year or the first half of next year, according to major film distributors.
然而，鉴于2015年中东呼吸综合征（MERS）疫情平息2个月后观影人数才恢复正常，预计此次疫情得到控制后，票房也需要一段时间才能恢复到疫情之前的水平。
However, given that the numbers returned to normal two months after the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic subsided, it is expected that, once the outbreak is contained, it will take some time for the box office to return to pre-epidemic levels.
另外，新片拍摄也出现差池。

在此情况下，部分观点指出，明年上半年韩国本土片可能出现空白期。
