我们为什么预测本月20日前每日新增病例归零？五个依据2020年2月6日，武汉市蔡甸区人民医院的隔离病房。
Why do we forecast zero new cases per day until February 20, 2020? Five people's hospital isolation ward in Cai Den district of Wuhan on February 6, 2020.
摄影/陈卓文|《财经》数据研究员 徐进图|《财经》视觉中心编辑|谢丽容一、 全国累计确诊病例变动趋势截至2月16日24:00，全国累计报告确诊新冠肺炎病例70548例。
At 24: 00 on February 16, a cumulative total of 70,548 new cases of coronary pneumonia have been reported nationwide, with Caijing's data researcher Xu Jin-tou and Caijing at its service.
以下为分区趋势图。
The following is the zoning trend chart.
图1国内非湖北地区见顶态势明显，湖北非武汉地区在变更口径导致数据上跳之后亦迅速趋向平缓。
Fig. 1 The trend of non-Hubei region in China is obvious. After changing the caliber, Hubei non-Wuhan area tends to flatten out rapidly.
二、 新增病例：国内非湖北地区继续坚定下降，指日归零图2国内非湖北新增病例下降至接近100例，省均已不到4例。
(2) New cases: China's non-Hubei region continued to decline steadily, indicating that the number of new cases fell to nearly 100 in non-Hubei province, with less than 4 cases in each province.
我们继续坚持预测：本月20日前每日新增病例归零。
We continue to insist on forecasting zero new cases per day until the 20th of this month.
有很多网友担心这样的预测是否过于乐观，也有很多网友希望了解预测主要依据。
Many netizens worry that such a forecast is too optimistic, but many netizens want to know the main basis of the forecast.
下面说说我们的预测方法和依据：1) 我们首先对柱状图左侧的数据不断进行分段拟合，同时我们也参照指数函数Y=r^X;Y示意图12) 我们参照北京2003年SARS每日新增病例分布图（见示意图2），并没有出现很多人担心的大长尾。
First of all, we continue to segment the data on the left side of the bar chart. We also refer to the exponential function Y = r ^ X; Y diagram 12.) We refer to the Beijing 2003 SARS case distribution map (see Fig. 2) without the long tail that many people worry about.
示意图23) 直接撤走母体，增殖模型失灵，峰值右侧尤其如此。
Diagram 23) Direct withdrawal of the mother, failure of the multiplication model, especially on the right side of the peak.
峰值的出现意味着追踪、隔离、防护等防控措施很好地到位了。
The emergence of peaks means that control measures such as tracing, isolation, and protection are well in place.
增值来自母体，有人认为新增病例一定与已感染人数有关，那么大量级的母体在那里，增量怎么可能很快归零呢？其实隔离就意味着直接撤走“母体”，让它不再发生本可能继续发生的传染。
The added value comes from the mother, some of whom believe that the new cases must be related to the number of infected people, so how can the increase quickly go to zero when the mother is there?
同理，追踪密切接触者则是提前撤走潜在的“母本”。
By the same token, tracking close contacts is an early withdrawal of potential "mother books."
追踪到位了，母本近乎归零了。
The tracking's in place. The mother is close to zero.
就传染意义而言，母本被不断归零，新增人数也会迅速归零。
In the sense of contagion, the mother is constantly zeroed in, and the number of new recruits quickly falls to zero.
4) 很多人认为这次新冠肺炎的传染力远远大于SARS，疫情期也一定会更长。
4) Many people believe that the new crown pneumonia is far more contagious than SARS, and that the outbreak is bound to be much longer.
殊不知事有两面，正因为传染力强，疫情起势更为凶猛，结果导致了，更早的全国性紧急动员应对。
There are two sides to everything, just because of the infectious power, the outbreak of more ferocity, resulting in an earlier national emergency mobilization response.
回想一下，两次肺炎起病时间大体相同，但2003年的此时，人们对疫情还普遍没有知觉，2月下旬北京召开了两会，3月上旬全国两会召开，3月下旬北京才有最初的预警。
In retrospect, the onset of pneumonia was about the same time, but at this time in 2003, there was a general lack of awareness of the epidemic, with two sessions in Beijing in late February, a National Congress in early March, and an initial warning in Beijing in late March.
而这次的新冠肺炎疫情，我们现在已经全民动员、全民防控已经跨过了每日新增量的峰值10多天了。
In this case, we have now mobilized the whole population, the control has passed the daily increment peak of more than 10 days.
5) 还有人担心返工潮。
5) There are also fears of a return to work.
我们可以看到各人口流入城市严阵以待，所谓“返工潮”已然被分散。
We can see the influx of people into the city ready, so-called "back-to-work" has been scattered.
更重要的是，所有返工人员都来自已经实现有效追踪、隔离、排查的非湖北地区，已相对安全。
More importantly, all reworkers are from non-Hubei areas that have been effectively tracked, quarantined and screened, and are relatively safe.
图3湖北非武汉地区在回归数据调整前下降轨迹基础上继续下降。
Fig. 3 The non-Wuhan area of Hubei province continued to decline on the basis of regression data adjustment.
态势坚定，显示防控措施全面到位。
Strong posture, indicating that control measures are in place.
图4武汉数据再现波动。
Fig. 4 Wuhan data reproduced fluctuation.
为武汉人民捏把汗。
For Wuhan people knead sweat.
三、 确诊病例增速：湖北非武汉地区继续降至1.45%，国内非湖北地区增速继续下降至1%以下，可望近日先后归零图5国内非湖北地区增速降至1%以内，有望率先归零！湖北非武汉地区的病例增速降至1.45%。
Growth rate of confirmed cases continues to drop to 1.45% in non-Wuhan areas of Hubei Province, and below 1% in non-Hubei areas of China.
也可以预测归零时间了。
You can also predict zero time.
武汉反复。
Wuhan repeated.
四、 国内非湖北地区密切接触者追踪力度：湖北有所上升，存量继续下降图6湖北虽只是微弱回升，却能表现出其对密切接触者追踪力度的提高，这是整体防控体系的一个关键环节。
Figure 6 Hubei Province, although only slightly rising, is able to show an improvement in its tracking of close contacts, which is a key part of the overall control system.
我们一直期待湖北这一指数上升，今天的数据坚定了这一走势。
We have been expecting the Hubei this index to rise, today's data confirmed this trend.
点赞！可惜我们至今没有武汉的数据。
Praise! Unfortunately, we do not have Wuhan data.
国内非湖北地区的追踪力度仍在不断加大。
The tracking intensity of non-Hubei area in China is still increasing.
图7湖北尚在接受医学观察者存量数据出现继续下降，表明湖北非武汉地区疫情明确趋缓。
Fig. 7 The stock data of medical observers in Hubei province continued to decrease, which showed that the epidemic situation in Hubei non-Wuhan area was decreasing.
国内非湖北地区继续下降降幅加大。
The decline in non-Hubei areas continued to increase.
五、 疑似病例新增和存量继续双双下降图8湖北和国内非湖北地区继续双双明显下降！图9湖北待查疑似病例稳中趋降。
Figure 8 Hubei and non-Hubei areas continue to decline significantly! Fig. 9 Suspected cases in Hubei Province declined steadily.
国内非湖北地区较快下降。
The non-Hubei area in China declined rapidly.
六、 国内非湖北地区在院治疗人数见顶图10湖北在院治疗人数仍有较大上升，交叉印证可推定主要是武汉大力提升收治能力所致。
The number of people treated in hospitals in non-Hubei areas of China is still very high. The number of people treated in the hospital in Hubei Province has increased greatly.
国内非湖北地区减幅加大。
The decrease in non-Hubei area increased.
七、 新增治愈人数上升，病死率继续缓慢回升图11每日新增治愈国内非湖北地区回落，湖北非武汉地区、武汉上升。
2007-9-25 21: 48 The number of new cured cases continues to rise slowly. Figure 11 The number of new cures fell daily in non-Hubei areas
图12湖北非武汉地区越过“黄金交叉”后继续扩大战果，每日释放出更多高度紧缺的医疗资源。
Fig. 12 After crossing the "golden cross," Hubei non-Wuhan area continues to expand its achievements, releasing more highly scarce medical resources daily.
图13病死率缓慢提升，总体态势正常。
Figure 13 The fatality rate is slowly increasing and the overall situation is normal.
疫情暴发初期，每日新增病例猛增，有可能快过死亡人数增长，因而导致病死率下降。
The surge in new cases per day in the early stages of the outbreak has the potential to increase faster than the number of deaths, leading to a reduction in the fatality rate.
经过一段时间滞后，随病程进展，会带来死亡人数增加较快；与此同时，随着疫情得到控制，每日新增确诊病例出现明显下降，累计确诊病例增速放缓。
Over time, the progression of the disease leads to a faster increase in the number of deaths; at the same time, as the epidemic is brought under control, there is a marked decrease in the number of new confirmed cases per day and a slowing in the cumulative rate of confirmed cases.
这一快（分子），一慢（分母），会导致病死率缓慢回升。
This fast (molecular), a slow (denominator), will lead to a slow recovery in the death rate.
只有在疫情基本结束时，这个数值才会逼近“最终病死率”。
Only when the epidemic is largely over will this figure approach the "final fatality rate."
小结：湖北以外省份日益接近达到新增病例归零、累计量见顶。
Summary: Hubei provinces are increasingly close to reaching zero new cases, the cumulative amount peaked.
湖北非武汉地区新增病例也比预计更早地进入快速收敛区。
The new cases in Hubei non-Wuhan area also entered the fast convergence area earlier than expected.
武汉显现平稳后再次出现波动。
Wuhan appears to be stable after the waves again.
有待观察。
It remains to be seen.
