防护和消毒还是很重视的，每送一次，全车消毒一次。
Protection and disinfection is still very important, every time sent, the entire vehicle disinfection.
口 述|尹 达整 理 |黄 祺我叫尹达，现在是武汉龙安社区的一名志愿者司机。
Ren Da Qi, my name is Yinda, and now a volunteer driver with Wuhan Longan community.
我的工作是保险销售，疫情发生之前，我一般每天一早去公司，然后出门拜访客户。
My job was insurance sales. Before the outbreak, I used to go to the company early in the morning and then go out and visit clients.
如果去的地方比较远，我会顺便接一单滴滴。
If the place is far away, I will drop by bit by bit.
腊月廿九（1月23日），滴滴平台发了一个公告，招募志愿者去社区服务，我看到马上就报名了。
On January 23rd, a notice was made on the drip platform to recruit volunteers to serve the community. I saw that the application was coming soon.
你说担心被传染吗？肯定也有担心。
Do you say you're worried about getting infected? You must be worried too.
但我是土生土长的武汉人，这个时候，总要做点什么。
But I am a native of Wuhan, this time, always do something.
从初一一早开始我们就工作了。
We have been working since the first day of junior high school.
我和另外4位志愿者被分配到洪山区龙安社区，这里主要以居民为主，离我家30公里左右，开车过来也不算太远。
Four other volunteers and I were assigned to Hongshan Longan community, mainly residents, about 30 kilometers from my home, driving not too far.
我们5个志愿者统一接受龙安居民区党组织书记的指挥，他会把用车需求发给我们。
Our five volunteers are under the direction of the Secretary of the Longan Neighborhood Party Organization, who will send us the demand for cars.
不是随便什么原因都可以用志愿者车辆的，书记这边会把关，只有生病就医的，接送抗疫物资的，特别紧要的公务，和医生接送，才可以用志愿者的车，我们还负责给行动不便的老人、病人以及隔离点的居民送餐。
Volunteer vehicles can be used for any reason, the clerk will check in, only sick patients, those carrying anti-epidemic supplies, especially urgent business, and doctors to transport, can use the volunteer's car, we are also responsible for the mobility of the elderly, the sick and residents of the isolation points.
你要是出门探亲啊，自己家采购啊，都不能用。
If you go out to see family members, their own home procurement ah, can not be used.
这十多天来，我平均每天出车三四趟，大多数是送病人去医院。
For more than a decade, I have traveled three or four times a day, mostly to take patients to hospital.
我接的第一单就是一位60多岁的阿姨，她发烧，社区医务人员已经排查了她的病情，不是病毒引起的发烧。
The first thing I answered was an aunt in her sixties who had a fever, and community medical staff had checked her condition, not a virus-induced fever.
我负责送她去医院就医，但是现在武汉医疗资源非常紧张，发热门诊就这么多，医务人员忙不过来，病床也紧张。
I take her to the hospital, but now Wuhan medical resources are very tight, fever clinic so many, medical staff busy, hospital beds are tight.
我带着他们一家，跑到第三家医院，阿姨才看上病。
I took them with me to a third hospital and my aunt fell ill.
这几天开始我会接到接送上海来的医生上下班的任务。
At the beginning of these days I will be sent to and from work by doctors from Shanghai.
上海医生住宿的龙安宾馆，是我们这个社区的一家招待所，属于我们服务的范围。
The Longan Hotel, where the Shanghai doctor lives, is a guest house in our community. It is within the scope of our services.
上海来的医生特别好，一般也不愿意麻烦我们，有的医生能走就自己走回宾馆了。
The doctor who comes from Shanghai is very good, do not want to trouble us generally, some doctors can walk to the hotel on their own.
车上，他们看起来特别疲惫，真的很辛苦。
On the bus, they looked very tired and really hard.
武汉各个区都有隔离观察点，我们的任务还包括给隔离观察点的居民送饭。
Wuhan has isolated observation points in all districts, our task also includes the isolation of observation point residents to send food.
需要隔离观察的居民统一生活在酒店里面，由社区统一安排专人照顾，也有专业的医生在那里驻点。
Residents who need to be observed in isolation live in the hotel, with a person under the care of the community and a professional doctor stationed there.
非典的时候我只有16岁，对疫情没什么印象。
When I was only 16 years old, I had no idea of the epidemic.
现在我是成年人，感触特别深。
Now that I'm an adult, I feel very deeply.
真的是一方有难八方支援，我是武汉人，更想做点贡献。
Is really a difficult eight parties to support, I am Wuhan people, more like to make a contribution.
公司给我们志愿者发了防护用品和消毒用品，接送病人的时候我们是全副武装的，防护服、护目镜都戴上。
The company distributed protective and disinfectant supplies to our volunteers. We were armed when transporting patients. We wore protective clothing and goggles.
如果是一般的运送物资和接送医生，我们穿防护服，护目镜没戴。
We wear protective clothing and goggles if it's a normal way of transporting supplies and taking doctors.
防护和消毒还是很重视的，每送一次，全车消毒一次。
Protection and disinfection is still very important, every time sent, the entire vehicle disinfection.
我现在每天一早就到社区待命，随时有任务随时发车，一般早上7点半到社区，傍晚没什么事就可以回家了。
I now come to the community early every morning, ready to leave at any time, usually 7: 30 in the morning to the community, no matter in the evening can go home.
午饭是外卖，吃了十多天外卖了，特殊时期没有办法，社区书记也是吃外卖的。
Lunch is take-out, after more than 10 days of take-out, no way to special period, the community secretary is also eating take-out.
晚上进家门前，我先给自己全身喷洒消毒的东西，站一会儿再进去。
At night, when I entered the house, I sprayed myself with disinfectant and stood for a while before I went in.
我妈妈是医院的护士，爸爸退休了，他们都很支持我做志愿者。
My mother is a hospital nurse, my father retired, they are very supportive of me as a volunteer.
中国人嘛，一般不喜欢表达感情，他们就是叮嘱我一定要注意防护，注意安全。
Chinese people, generally do not like to express feelings, they are telling me to pay attention to protection, attention to safety.
如果说和平常有什么不一样，可能就是回家什么都不用我做，饭菜摆好，坐下就吃。
If there is often a difference in peace, it is probably going home with nothing to do with me, food set and sitting down to eat.
父母对我的关心都在里面了。
All my parents' concern for me is inside.
武汉多数社区，都有我们这样的志愿者司机，平均每个社区有3-7辆志愿者的车，供社区安排使用。
Most communities in Wuhan have volunteer drivers like us, with an average of three to seven volunteers per community for community-based arrangements.
我们不会向乘客收一分钱，政府有一定的补贴。
We don't charge passengers a dime. The government has a certain subsidy.
现在武汉的大街上，很少看到人，也很少有车。
Nowadays, there are few people in Wuhan's streets, and few cars.
过去到了周末，我会跟同学、朋友出去聚会，现在看来，这种特殊的生活还要持续一点时间。
Over the weekend, I would go out with my classmates and friends. Now it seems that this special life will last a little longer.
