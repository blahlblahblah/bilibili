作者 | 黎明编辑 | 阿伦疫情当前，危机四伏，不少中小企业都将裁员提上了日程。
AT THE RUN & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
但裁员不当，却可能加速一家公司的死亡。
But mislayoffs could hasten the death of a company.
先讲一个小故事。
Let's start with a little story.
去年11月初，电子烟行业的线上销售被叫停，有一家电子烟公司瞬间损失掉一半订单。
In early November, online sales in the e-cigarette industry were halted, with one e-cigarette company losing half its order in a flash.
CEO决定裁员，但又有些犹豫不决，磨磨蹭蹭裁了三个月，一直持续到今年1月底。
The CEO decided to lay off workers, but hesitated, dragging on for three months until the end of January.
这个时候疫情爆发，CEO才发现账上资金已经撑不够三个月。
Only then did the CEO realize that the funds on his books were running out of money for three months.
他想进行清退式裁员，只保留核心骨干，却发现人心早已涣散，公司只剩下“老弱病残”，骨干难寻、业务难做，距离破产已经不远。
He wants to make a clean-back layoff, leaving only the core cadre, only to find that the people have been scattered, the company is left "old, infirm", hard-to-find, difficult to do business, bankruptcy is not far away.
对于很多企业而言，疫情，只是压死它们的最后一根稻草。
For many businesses, the epidemic is only the last straw that kills them.
裁员是企业在危机时刻的一种自救方式，虽然这种方式要承受巨大的外界压力。
Redundancy is a way for companies to save themselves in times of crisis, even if it is under enormous external pressure.
很多CEO寄希望于通过裁员来缩减成本，保存实力等待东山再起。
Many CEOs are hoping to cut costs by cutting jobs and save power while waiting for a comeback.
但裁员往往牵一发而动全身，它是一道复杂的数学题，稍有不慎便有可能满盘皆输。
But layoffs tend to be all-encompassing. They are a complex mathematical problem that can easily be lost with a little carelessness.
疫情之下，裁员是身处困境的中小企业纾困的最优解吗？裁员这笔账，究竟应该怎么算？“6个月是生死线，12个月是安全线”徐尘锋是一个连续创业者，疫情爆发前，他为公司储备了12个月的现金流，虽然公司未盈利，但避免了疫情期间资金短缺的困境。
Under the epidemic, are layoffs the best solution to the plight of small and medium-sized enterprises? What exactly should be counted as layoffs? "Six months is life and death, 12 months is safety line." Xu Difeng, a serial entrepreneur, saved the company 12 months of cash flow before the outbreak.
“裁员本质上是一道算术题，裁不裁、裁多少，都要计算。
"Redundancy is essentially a matter of arithmetic, and no matter how much you cut, you have to calculate.
” 徐尘锋说，他经历过大裁员。
Mr Xu said he had gone through too many layoffs.
上一次创业，因为遇到资本寒冬，他将公司300人的团队裁到只剩60人。
The last time he started a business, he cut the company's 300-strong team to just 60 because of the cold winter.
“比如你账上还剩下1000万，按12个月的生存期来算，你每个月的开支就肯定不能高于83万。
"If you had 10 million left in your account, you certainly wouldn't be spending more than 830,000 dollars a month on a 12-month life span.
按每个月83万的预算，你能养多少人，一算就出来了。
With a monthly budget of 830,000, you can raise as many people as you can.
” 徐尘锋一边说一边计算。
Xu Dust-feng calculated as he spoke.
按照他的经验，对于一家公司而言，现金流6个月是生死线，12个月是安全线，创始人考虑要不要裁员，关键看账上现金有多少。
In his experience, six months of cash flow is life and death for a company, and 12 months is a safe line for founders to decide whether to lay off workers and how much cash they have in their books.
“6个月是生死线”的说法是业内惯例。
The phrase "six months is life and death" is an industry convention.
新潮传媒2月10日宣布裁员500人，创始人张继学的理由也是“如果（公司）收入归零，也只能活六七个月”。
Founder Zhang Jixue, who laid off 500 people on Feb. 10, said he would live only six or seven months if his income fell to zero.
虽然公司账上有10亿元现金，但倒推出来的生存期也只有6个月。
Although the company has a billion dollars in cash on its books, it has only six months to fall back on.
“如果现金储备低于6个月，那就要开始考虑裁员，因为你不裁，那公司可能就活不了。
"If you have less than six months of cash reserves, you're going to start thinking about layoffs because if you don't, the company may not survive."
” 徐尘锋说。
'said Xu.
但在具体执行上，除了盯准6个月的生死线，创始人还要考虑裁员成本和业务重置成本。
But beyond a six-month lifespan, founders need to consider layoffs and replacement costs.
换言之，要对比看业务的重置成本是不是低于裁员的成本。
In other words, see if the replacement cost of the business is lower than the cost of layoffs.
图 / 视觉中国“比如我是开餐馆的，因为疫情影响我开不了门，每个月亏损20万。
Photo / Vision China For example, I own a restaurant because of the epidemic situation. I can't open the door.
如果我判断未来5个月疫情都无法结束，我的店无法营业，那意味着未来5个月我要亏损100万。
If I judge that the next five months are not over and my store is not open, that means I'll be losing a million dollars over the next five months.
如果我重新再开一家餐馆，100万以内就能搞定，那我会毫不犹豫马上裁员关店。
If I open another restaurant and I can get it done in less than a million, I won't hesitate to lay off workers.
” 徐尘锋举例，“只要关店就是赚的，而且我会在疫情结束后重新再开店。
Xu Dust-feng said, "As long as the store is closed, and I will re-open shop after the epidemic.
”这跟炒股的思路类似：当股价持续下跌时，是选择及时止损等待抄底，还是一路硬抗直到被平仓。
This is similar to the thinking behind stocks: When share prices continue to fall, choose to stop losses just in time to catch the bottom, or fight hard until they are unwound.
这其中的核心点在于对外部环境和公司未来的判断，而这正是最大的不确定性所在。
Central to this is the judgment of the external environment and the future of the company, which is where the greatest uncertainty lies.
2015年，中国互联网O2O创业最火热的时候，徐尘锋加入了共享出行领域的战争。
In 2015, when China's Internet O2O startup hit its peak, Xu joined the battle of shared travel.
在拿了好几轮融资之后，公司快速扩张到300人的规模。
After several rounds of financing, the company expanded rapidly to 300 people.
就在这个时候，A股爆发股灾，一级市场迅速转入资本寒冬，以烧钱著称的O2O领域的投资被VC圈封杀。
At this time, A-share stocks broke out, the first market quickly turned to capital winter, known as the money-burning O2O investment was closed by VC circle.
在公司现金只剩下6个月的时候，投资方召开董事会建议徐尘锋裁员，但徐尘锋强势拒绝了。
With only six months to go in cash, investors convened a board meeting to recommend Xu to lay off workers, but Xu declined.
他的理由是：“公司的业务数据还在涨，而且新一轮融资的投资方好像还有意向。
"The company's business data are still going up and there seems to be interest on the part of investors in a new round of fundraising," he said.
”徐尘锋判断公司能在6个月内度过危机，但投资方并不这样认为。
Xu judged the company to be able to survive the crisis within six months, but investors did not think so.
后来事实证明徐尘锋错了，他在三个月后不得不进行了一轮清洗式的大裁员。
Xu turned out to be wrong and had to undergo a wave of sweeping layoffs three months later.
“投资人一般会鼓励你裁员，因为他们的钱已经投进来了，肯定不希望公司马上破产，他们的逻辑是：只要公司账上还有钱，那么就还有机会重新翻盘，如果没钱了，那他们就无能为力了，而且意味着他们的钱打水漂了。
'Investors tend to encourage you to lay off workers because they have money already invested and certainly don't want the company to go bankrupt right away. The logic is that as long as there's money in the company's books, there's a chance of it being overturned.
”一位创业者总结说。
"concluded one entrepreneur.
所以大部分时候投资人会牢牢卡住6个月的生死线，而且会对比业务的重置成本。
So most of the time investors get stuck in a life-or-death situation for six months and compare the replacement cost of their business.
一位人民币VC的投资人对燃财经说，让公司保留有生力量非常重要，裁员往往是特殊时期的自救手段，只要公司账上还有钱，未来就可能还有机会。
'It's important to keep the company alive, 'said one yuan VC investor.' These layoffs are often a way to save yourself in special times, and as long as the company has money on its books, there may be opportunities in the future.
“钱花掉了就没了，但员工走了还可以再招。
"It's gone when the money's gone, but employees can still move on when they're gone.
”裁员不当的代价疫情的爆发是一个突然因素，复工进度和影响时长都无法预估，这增加了创始人做决策的难度，尤其是在裁员这件事上。
The cost of layoffs is a sudden, unpredictable pace and impact, which makes it harder for founders to make decisions, especially when it comes to layoffs.
采用错误的方式裁员是致命的。
Using the wrong approach to layoffs can be fatal.
在燃财经采访的多位创始人眼中，犹豫不决和拖泥带水会让裁员陷入僵局，并继而影响大局。
In the eyes of many of the founders who interviewed the business, hesitancy and muddling through can lead to gridlock in layoffs and, in turn, affect the broader picture.
“当你发现事情不对的时候，就不能犹犹豫豫，你应该啪啪把所有的东西都推倒，然后宁可重来。
"When you find something is wrong, you can't hesitate. You should snap everything down and start over.
这取决于你对这件事情看得有多透。
It depends on how well you see it.
”一位出行行业的创始人陈武说。
Chen Wu, founder of the travel industry, said.
2016年，陈武还在创业做电单车。
In 2016, Chen Wu is still starting a business to do motorcycles.
公司业绩跟不上，资金紧张，投资人建议裁员，公司需要从100人裁到30人。
Companies are running out of money, investors are proposing layoffs and companies need to be cut from 100 to 30.
陈武下不了决心，本来可以一次性完成的裁员，他分成三轮来完成。
Unable to make up his mind, Chen divided into three rounds of layoffs, which could have been accomplished in one round.
结果带来一个非常大的问题——“当你裁掉一批人的时候，公司就会变得人心惶惶，剩下的人就慌了。
The result is a very big problem - "When you lay off people, the company becomes scary and the rest of us panic.
这就像是我通知你一个月之后离职，完了，这个人再正能量，这一个月之内也会传递负能量给其他人。
It's like I told you to quit a month later, and when it's over, the person reenergizes, and the month passes negative energy on to others.
”因为裁员的拖沓，公司氛围和业务都受到了很大影响，一些优秀的人自己选择了离开。
Because of the slowness of layoffs, the atmosphere and the business have been affected so much that some good people have chosen to leave.
日后陈武复盘：“裁员最忌讳的是裁不彻底，拖拖拉拉只会浪费你更多的子弹。
Chen Wufu: "The most taboo to lay off workers is not thorough, dragging your feet will only waste more bullets."
就好像这一个草坪里面有野草，拔一点，长出一点，拔一点，又长出一点。
It's like there's weeds in this lawn. Pull out a little, grow a little, pull out a little, and grow a little.
”红杉资本在一份报告里用一张图讲述了这样一个故事：图 / 红杉资本2008年金融危机，两家业务规模很接近的公司采用了截然不同的裁员策略。
In a report, Sequoia Capital used a chart to tell the story of the 2008 financial crisis, when two companies with similar businesses adopted radically different layoffs.
A公司担心裁员引起外界质疑，影响公司招聘，一开始砍掉市场费用，后来又加大绩效考核力度进行末位淘汰，再后来扛不住投资人的压力开始大幅裁员，最后导致能人出走，留下的人大部分都在消极磨工。
Worried about layoffs that could affect hiring, Company A initially slashed marketing fees, then stepped up its performance reviews for last-minute obsolescence, and then, under pressure from investors, began slashing jobs, eventually leading to runaways, most of whom were passive grinders.
B公司却顺利地度过了那个冬天，因为CEO裁员一步到位，虽然损失惨重，但是业务逐渐在复苏。
Company B weathered the winter smoothly, as the CEO laid off his staff and, despite heavy losses, the business was gradually recovering.
有经验的CEO会选择长痛不如短痛，年轻的CEO大部分时候会选择迂回的策略。
Experienced CEOs prefer long pain to short pain, and younger CEOs choose roundabout strategies most of the time.
不同的选择决定了不同的结果，但大部分CEO往往会做出A公司的选择。
Different choices determine different outcomes, but most CEOs tend to make choices about company A.
同样是在2008年金融危机，曾经的明星创业公司PPTV出现现金流危机，创始人姚欣犯了和上述A公司CEO一样的错误，虽然最后PPTV勉强过关，但也元气大伤。
Yao Xinmin, founder of the former star start-up company PPTV, made the same mistake as the CEO of company A in the financial crisis of 2008. Although PPTV scraped through, it was also badly hurt.
2015年A股股灾，2016年创投泡沫，徐尘锋和陈武也犯了同样的错，最后徐尘锋宣布退出项目另谋出路，陈武在两年后关停了电动车的项目。
After the A-share disaster in 2015 and the venture-capital bubble in 2016, Xu and Chen Wu made the same mistake. Finally, Xu announced that he would quit the project and find another way out.
这一次疫情，很多企业几乎面临2008年和2015年相似的处境，那么这一次，又有多少CEO能够做出正确的抉择？不论是姚欣，还是徐尘锋和陈武，他们都是在重复红杉资本那个经典案例里的故事。
How many CEOs can make the right decisions this time, whether Yao Xin, Xu and Chen Wu, repeat the story in the classic Sequoia Capital case.
虽然背景不尽相同，但CEO的难处却是相似的。
The background is different, but the difficulties for CEOs are similar.
坏人总要有人来当，而在裁员这个情境里，CEO就是那个最大的坏人。
Bad people have to be taken in, and in the context of layoffs, the CEO is the biggest villain.
“有时候真的没办法，公司这艘船要沉了，关系到所有人的生死，只能客观去看待，不留情面。
"Sometimes there is no way, the company this ship will sink, the life and death of all concerned, can only be viewed objectively, without mercy.
”陈武说。
'said Chen Wu.
谁来出面裁员也是个问题。
Who will come forward and lay off workers is also a problem.
陈武这些年创业得出的结论是：谁的手下谁来裁。
Chen Wu these years start a business to come to the conclusion: Whose subordinate who will lay down the job.
陈武举例：比如A项目10个人，因为种种原因要裁员，就应该让A项目的负责人，把这10个人裁完了之后，再把他自己裁掉。
Chen Wu: For example, in Project A, 10 people should be made redundant for various reasons, and the person in charge of Project A should be made to lay off these 10 people and then lay off himself.
“真正好的leader，按照职业精神就应该这么办，否则负责人先撤了，把包袱丢给HR，下面的人会跟HR产生很多纠纷。
I'm sorry, I can't wait to see you again.I'm sorry, I can't wait to see you again.I'd like to talk to you about this.I'd like to talk to you.
”裁员这笔账应该找谁算？裁员这件事，有人认为是CEO的锅，他抛弃了自己的同伴；有人认为是投资人的锅，他们只顾自己的利益；还有人认为是外部环境的原因，这属于不可抗力。
The layoffs, which some believe are the preserve of CEOs, abandon their peers, are seen as the pot of investors who are driven solely by their own interests, and still others see the external environment as a force majeure.
一位投资人反问说：“就像是一艘船行驶在海上，现在船太重了，我们要抛掉一些人下去，或者因为风浪太大了，有些人被颠簸掉进了海里，那你说这是谁的锅？”云造创始人邱懿武对燃财经说，裁员看上去是外部环境的问题，但本质是因为内部的经营问题，“一个公司的架构，本身在扩张期就是不合理的，这是一种必然。
"It's like a ship on the sea and now it's too heavy for us to throw some people down, or because the wind and waves are so strong that some people are bumped into the sea," said Qiu Yi, founder of Cloud Yi.
”他认为尤其是在互联网行业，野蛮式扩张过后，必然伴随着裁员。
He argues that particularly in the internet industry, brutal expansion is bound to be followed by job losses.
LinkedIn领英创始人里德·霍夫曼写过一本书《闪电式扩张》，他在书中谈到企业在四个阶段的不同作战模式：海盗、海军陆战队、统一大陆的军队和警察。
Reed Hoffman, founder of LinkedIn, wrote The Blitz Expansion, in which he talked about the different modes of business in four phases: piracy, the Marine Corps, the Army and the Police of the United Continent.
海盗和海军陆战队属于企业发展早期、快速抢占海滩攻占大陆的阶段，军队和警察属于统治和维护秩序阶段。
Pirates and Marines belong to the early stage of enterprise development, the rapid seizure of the beach captured the mainland, the military and police belong to the stage of rule and maintenance of order.
在早期抢滩的阶段，讲究的是团队的无条件信任，对外的急速扩张，因为只有把地盘攻下，企业才可能再往纵深发展。
In the early stages of beach rush, the focus is on the unconditional trust of the team, the rapid expansion of external, because only when the territory of the offensive, enterprises can be further developed.
“很多风口项目，在野蛮式扩张的阶段，其实都是在抢滩。
"Many of the trough projects, in the savage expansion phase, are in fact in the beach.
枪和炮是乱打的，浪费一些子弹很正常。
Guns and guns are fired indiscriminately, and it is normal to waste some bullets.
”邱懿武说。
"said Qiu Yi Wu.
当抢滩失败，在部队撤退的过程中，裁员就发生了。
When the shoals failed, layoffs occurred as the troops retreated.
另外，抢滩过程中一旦出现突发的重大意外事件，比如暴风雪、大面积的寒潮、疫情等，也会导致抢滩行动的突然休克，被迫进入裁员。
In addition, major unexpected events, such as blizzards, large-scale cold surges and outbreaks of disease, can also lead to the sudden shock of beach-raiding operations, forcing people into layoffs.
图 / 视觉中国今年的疫情，对很多正急速扩张的互联网公司，或在线下跑马圈地的企业而言，都是一场风暴。
Figure / Vision China's epidemic this year has been a storm for many Internet companies that are expanding rapidly, or for companies that are running horses on-line.
那些在2019年拿了大笔融资、团队人数翻了好几倍的互联网公司，很多在疫情期间进行了裁员。
Internet companies that raised large sums of money in 2019 and doubled the size of their teams, many of them laying off workers during the epidemic.
以去年的风口行业电子烟为例，多位电子烟公司CEO告诉燃财经，目前已经进行了大幅度的裁员，并且还会考虑继续裁员。
In the case of last year's e-cigarette industry, the CEOs of many e-cigarette companies told Flaming Finance that significant layoffs had already taken place and that further layoffs would be considered.
“这跟2008年的金融危机、2015年的资本寒冬，所带来的传导效应是一样的。
"This is the same transmission effect as the 2008 financial crisis and the 2015 capital winter.
”徐尘锋说。
'said Xu.
但抢滩成功却并不意味着一劳永逸。
But a successful beach rush does not mean once and for all.
从海军陆战队向军队警察转变的过程中，模式转变会带来组织结构的转变，“当正统的军队开始进行管理的时候，那些不守纪律的、效率低的，就会在这个时候被赶走。
As the transition from the Marine Corps to the Military Police proceeds, the paradigm shift will bring about a structural shift: "When the orthodox army begins to run, the undisciplined and inefficient will be driven out at this time."
”邱懿武感慨：“说起来是很残忍的，但是现实就是这样子的。
"said Qiu Yi Wu with emotion:" It is cruel to say, but the reality is like this.
就是说这场仗我没打下来是死，打下来说不定也是死。
So the battle I didn't fight was death, maybe it was death.
”陈武在那次大规模裁员中，经历了很多人无法体会的纠结：“你知道有多紧张，我感觉就是做错事了，极度压抑，极度自责，极度内疚，感觉公司没做好要裁员都是我的错。
During the massive layoffs, Chen went through a tangle that many couldn't understand: "You know how nervous I feel, I feel like I'm doing something wrong, extremely depressed, extremely remorseful, extremely guilty, and feeling the company isn't ready to lay off people."
”一位餐饮老板对燃财经说，这次疫情持续了一个月的时候，他也认真考虑过裁员，但最终没和员工开口，“不知道从何说起，最后想想还是算了，再挺一挺，或许就过去了呢。
When the outbreak lasted a month, he also seriously considered layoffs, but didn't finally ask employees, 'I don't know where to start,' said one catering boss to Flaming Finance.
”企业就像人一样，东西吃多了会拉肚子，病毒感染了会生病，然后就会上吐下泻，需要把体内的毒素排出去。
Businesses, like humans, have loose bowels when they eat too much, get sick when a virus infects them, and then spit out toxins in their bodies.
但邱懿武相信，绝大部分CEO还是有企业家精神的，企业的社会责任感也在加强，“大家都在打疫情这场仗，我相信企业还是愿意扛一扛的。
But Churchill believes that most CEOs are enterprising, and that corporate social responsibility is growing. "Everybody is fighting the epidemic, and I believe the company is willing to carry it."
”“下一场雨季来临的时候，地面都是青草，依然四季花开。
"" When the next rainy season comes, the ground is covered with grass and the seasons are still blooming.
”铂德创始人汪泽其说。
"said Wang Zeqi, founder of platinum.
