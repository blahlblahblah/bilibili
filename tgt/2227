燃财经（ID:rancaijing）原创作者 | 孔明明编辑 | 周昶帆过去几年，有上百家新能源汽车企业成立，平均每家背后都站着数十位投资人，融资的速度和金额达到顶峰，每个人都在梦想找到“中国的特斯拉”。
HUNG Ming-ming, the former founder and founder of Fun Finance, has set up hundreds of new-energy car companies over the past few years, each with an average of dozens of investors standing behind them. The pace and amount of financing has peaked. Everyone is dreaming of "Tesla in China."
而车市低迷、补贴退潮，新能源汽车企业至今无法摆脱烧钱和亏损问题，不断出现裁员、欠薪、拖欠供应商货款、工厂停工等乱象，这些都在让投资者和消费者失去信心。
And the downturn in the car market, subsidy recession, new energy car companies can not get rid of burning money and losses, there are layoffs, back wages, unpaid suppliers, factory shutdowns, all of which are losing confidence for investors and consumers.
随着特斯拉高调进入中国市场、上海工厂开工，新造车势力正在面临“洗牌”时刻。
With Tesla's high profile entry into the Chinese market and the start of the Shanghai plant, the new car power is facing a "reshuffle" moment.
2月26日，燃财经举办线上沙龙，主题聚焦于造车行业，威马汽车创始人、董事长、CEO沈晖，沄柏资本主席鲍毅进行了主题分享，并和燃财经总编辑贺树龙做了对话。
On Feb. 26, 2008, Flaming Finance hosted an online salon focusing on the car-building industry. Waima founder, chairman and CEO Shen Hui, Chairman of Compaq Capital, Mr Boyi, shared the theme and had a dialogue with HE Shulong, chief financial editor.
鲍毅认为，新能源汽车企业正在面临洗牌，仅有一两家核心的、真正能造出好车的企业可以存活。
Bao Yi thinks, new energy automobile enterprise is facing shuffle, have only one or two core, can build a good car really can survive.
而特斯拉进入中国虽然是“狼来了”，但“它仅能满足市场需求的一部分，难以挤压到其他新能源汽车企业的生存空间，大家各自都有空间，各自都有舞台”。
But Tesla entered China as a "wolf," but "it can only meet a part of the market demand, difficult to squeeze into the living space of other new energy vehicle enterprises, we all have space, each has its own stage."
以下为鲍毅在燃财经沙龙上的分享内容：新能源汽车不仅是汽车业的革命，也是能源、智能、消费模式的革命疫情改变的是目前车市的发展节奏，新能源汽车产业的发展在春天来临后反而会加速。
The new energy vehicle is not only the revolution of the automobile industry, but also the revolution of energy, intelligence and consumption pattern. What changes the development rhythm of the present automobile market is the development rhythm of the new energy automobile industry.
新能源汽车不仅是一场汽车业的革命，更是一场能源、智能和消费模式的革命。
New energy vehicle is not only a revolution of automobile industry, but also a revolution of energy, intelligence and consumption pattern.
一方面，汽车已经从新代步工具变成了一场新能源革命。
On the one hand, cars have gone from a new generation of tools to a new energy revolution.
在这场能源革命里，绿色也是沄柏资本布局的重要领域。
In this energy revolution, green is also an important area for the distribution of capital.
比如我们和威马合作的三元锂电池是目前乘用车的主要使用方向。
For example, we work with Waima Li-Li battery is the current main direction of passenger vehicles.
另外，我们也在着力布局甲醇燃料电池，它容易运输且产能充足，我们投资的甲醇燃料电池项目也已经接近商业化。
In addition, we are also focusing on methanol fuel cells, which are easy to transport and have sufficient capacity, and the methanol fuel cell project we are investing in is close to being commercialized.
同时，汽车业也掀起了一场智能革命，让世界变得互联和智能。
At the same time, the auto industry has launched an intelligent revolution to make the world interconnected and intelligent.
中国在芯片、软件、硬件这些核心技术上，常常被掐住脖子，所以沄柏资本在新动力之外还在布局新智能，比如旷视科技等，我们也鼓励旷视跟威马这样的企业全面合作，共同武装起来。
China is often choked on the core technologies of chips, software and hardware, so we encourage Absenteeism to work with companies like Wimma to arm themselves with new intelligence, such as truancy technology.
更重要的是，我们要在核心技术上寻求掌控和突破，摆脱对西方的依赖。
More importantly, we need to seek mastery and breakthroughs in core technologies to wean ourselves off dependence on the West.
此外，新能源汽车更是一场消费模式的革命。
In addition, the new energy vehicle is a consumption model of the revolution.
威马的销售体系，包括建设中的金融体系，都是创新的，都是新经济、新金融环境下年轻人喜闻乐见的方式，同时也是沄柏资本关注的新模式方向。
Weimar's marketing system, including the financial system under construction, is innovative and popular with young people in the new economy and financial environment. It is also a new mode of attention for the capital.
我个人认为，这场革命刚刚吹起了号角。
Personally, I think this revolution has just played a bugle call.
疫情虽然让新能源汽车短期销量受到影响，但不能阻挡传统汽车向更酷、更环保、更绿色、更聪明的智能汽车转移。
While the epidemic is hurting short-term sales of new energy vehicles, it will not stop conventional cars from moving to cooler, greener, greener, smarter cars.
在新造车势力里，我们也坚信除了特斯拉以外，中国一定会有一两家引领未来的新能源汽车企业能够脱颖而出。
In the new car power, we also firmly believe that in addition to Tesla, China will have one or two new energy car companies to lead the way.
沄柏资本成立于2016年，目前主要有两条业务线：一个是跨国协同，另一个是产投结合。
Founded in 2016, Compaq Capital now has two main lines of business: one is transnational synergy, the other is the combination of production and delivery.
跨国协同上，我们投资了德国的工业4.0，把德国最好的汽车生产线与中国市场结合起来；我们收购了瑞士的高端装备把它引入中国，一起走向一带一路市场；我们投资了东南亚的医疗服务和美国相关的芯片行业等，将最好的科技技术与中国市场进行结合。
In cross-border coordination, we have invested in German industry 4.0 to integrate Germany's best car production lines with the Chinese market; we have bought Swiss high-end equipment to bring it to China and move along the way; we have invested in medical services in South-East Asia and the related chip industry in the United States to integrate the best technology with the Chinese market.
产投结合上，我们希望在新动力、新智能、新模式、新生活里找到中国未来的领军人物和王者。
Combining production and investment, we hope to find the future leader and king of China in the new driving force, new intelligence, new mode and new life.
通过沄柏资本的国际网络和资本力量，通过沄柏资本本身的生态系统，支持这些企业从一朵花变成一个花园、一棵树，成为一片森林，引领产业革命。
Through the international network and capital power of Zhangpao Capital, the enterprises are supported to transform from a flower into a garden, a tree and a forest, leading an industrial revolution through the development of its own ecosystem.
同时，我们跟人工智能、芯片等领域头部企业合作，布局整个产业革命，同时也会促进像威马、旷视等优秀企业共享共生。
At the same time, we work with leading companies in areas such as artificial intelligence and chips to lay out the entire industrial revolution, while also promoting symbiosis among good companies like Wilma and absenteeism.
这个时代的企业家、未来的产业领袖，将不再是独自成功，而是共享共生，通过金融资本和产业产投联动，引领整个技术和市场革命，一起迈向成功。
The entrepreneurs of this era, the industry leaders of the future, will no longer succeed alone, but will share a symbiosis, leading the entire technological and market revolution to success through a combination of financial capital and industrial investment.
对话鲍毅：恐惧有时能制造需求灾难会带来机会燃财经：疫情给沄柏资本投资的项目带来哪些影响？你从项目那里听到的最多的困难是什么？给他们提供了哪些建议和帮助？鲍毅：疫情来临前我一直说，这两年的世界渐行渐远，一场疫情又一次让我们感觉到世界是紧密连在一起的。
: [-- --] Dialogue: Fear can sometimes create demand Catastrophes bring opportunities to ignite finance: What's the impact of the epidemic on projects in which Compaq Capital invests? Bowie: Before the epidemic hit, I always said that the world is getting farther away in the past two years.
全球经济的每一部分都是牵一发而动全身，再自我保护也离不开全球化趋势。
Every part of the global economy is in a state of flux, and self-protection cannot be separated from globalization.
对沄柏资本来说，欧洲项目、在中国的工厂和订单都受到一定程度影响。
For Compaq Capital, European projects, factories and orders in China have all been affected to some extent.
但我相信疫情过后，一切会迅速恢复正常。
But I believe everything will return to normal soon after the outbreak.
当所有人都觉得绝望时，其实是希望的开始，恐惧有时候能制造需求，灾难会带来机会。
When everyone feels desperate, it is the beginning of hope, fear can sometimes create demand and disaster can bring opportunity.
非典促使京东完成了从线下到线上的决定性转变，阿里完成了从to B 到to C的决定性转变。
SARS enabled Jingdong to complete a decisive shift from offline to online, and Ali completed a decisive shift from B to C.
正是因为一场灾难到来，让大家在观念、理念上更渴求新的技术革命。
It is because of a disaster, let everyone in the concept, the concept of a new technological revolution is more eager.
这次疫情一定会改变中国。
This outbreak is bound to change China.
不过，改变中国的其实不是疫情，而是对新技术更疯狂地渴求。
What is changing China, however, is not an epidemic, but a crazier craving for new technologies.
智慧革命会提速，人类会转向更智能化、更数字化、更充满智慧的方向，去呼吸、去接受治疗、去买东西、去出行。
The revolution in wisdom will accelerate, and man will move in a smarter, more digital, more intelligent direction, to breathe, to receive treatment, to buy things, to travel.
我给大家的建议是，疫情当前，要做好原本打算做的事情。
My advice to you is to do what you intend to do with the current epidemic.
对投资人来说，资本市场投资的是未来，不差这两三个月，这两三个月销售额确实会受到影响，但我们要坚信，疫情一定会过去，以后投资看的还是未来十年的发展。
For investors, capital markets are investing in the future, and two or three months from now these two or three months will indeed be affected, but we have to be confident that the epidemic will pass and that future investments will be made in the next decade.
只要这个公司的技术和价值有未来，不会导致大的变化。
As long as the technology and value of the company have the future, will not lead to major changes.
谁能先赚钱谁才能真正地起来燃财经：沄柏资本是威马汽车的投资人，投资威马之前有没有看一看市场上其他比较知名的新造车企业？能否评价一下这些企业？鲍毅：在看威马之前，我们看了市场上所有比较知名的新造车企业。
Who can make money first to really burn the money: Capital is the Venture Capital investor in Wimma, have you ever looked at other well-known start-ups in the market before investing in Wilma? Bao: Before we looked at Wilma, we looked at all the better known new car companies in the market.
我们投资威马是看中威马的整个团队，以沈总为首的国际化和国内落地能力兼具的团队，整个团队在一起工作和磨合了很久。
We have invested in a team that looks at Wimak, both internationally and nationally, headed by Shen, and has worked and worn out for a long time.
造车不是一个人的事儿。
Building a car is not a one-man affair.
造车也不是光靠砸资本。
Cars are not built on capital alone.
它是世界上工程、科技、销售角度而言都最复杂的一件事情，需要有传统的汽车产业经验又有未来新智能时代DNA的一群人。
It is one of the most complex projects in the world in terms of engineering, technology and marketing, requiring a group of people with traditional automobile industry experience and DNA for the future of the new intelligence age.
燃财经：聊起新造车，槽点总是不断，过去一年新造车的负面新闻几乎天天有。
Flaming Finance: Talk about new cars, the trough is always continuous, the past year the new car almost daily negative news.
你认为还需要多久新造车的充电、续航、安全、价格等等痛点才能被解决？什么时候智能新能源汽车才能成为普通人购车的首选？鲍毅：首先不管槽点或者批评，智能汽车作为城市人群代步首选的大方向、大趋势，谁也阻挡不住，因为它在充电、续航、安全、价格、未来年轻人的新生活这些方面，都是最好的代步和智能解决方式。
How much longer do you think it will take to recharge your new car, keep it afloat, keep it safe, keep prices, etc. When will the smart new car be the first choice for ordinary people to buy a car? Bao: First, no matter where the trough or the criticism, smart cars are the best alternative and intelligent solutions.
目前新能源汽车充电越来越便利，城市充电桩建设迅速，一线城市公共充电桩使用非常便捷，我们有个数据是，到2019年12月底，全国公共充电桩和私人充电桩总计保有量接近122万台，同比增长50%以上。
At present, new energy vehicles are charging more easily, urban charging piles are being built rapidly, and the use of public charging piles in first-tier cities is very convenient. We have a figure of nearly 1.22 million public and private charging piles nationwide by the end of December 2019, an increase of more than 50 per cent over the previous year.
其中公共充电基础设施保有量超过50万台，新能源汽车累计销量超过了400万台，另外电池的续航里程也能支持偶尔的长途用车，价格也在往下走，使得它能经济和适用。
Of these, the public charging infrastructure holds more than 500,000 units, new energy vehicles have sold more than 4 million, and battery mileage supports occasional long-haul cars, and prices are dropping, making it economical and applicable.
这两年造车企业太多了，浪费了太多的政府和公共资源，最后一定会只留下几家核心的、真正能够造出好车的企业，由他们和传统企业一起来完成这场革命，由他们一起来推动新能源汽车在充电、续航、安全上被大众所认知。
These two years are too many car-building enterprises, waste too much government and public resources, and eventually there will be only a few core enterprises that can really build good cars, together with the traditional enterprises, to promote the new energy car in charge, navigation, safety awareness.
我觉得新能源汽车作为消费者购买首选的日子指日可待，一定比我们想象中来得更早、更快。
I think the new energy car as a consumer of choice in the days to come, must have come earlier and faster than we thought.
另外，它绝不只是一个代步工具，它的整个智能化，会让你觉得它就是一个朋友，跟它一起出行会感觉到更安全、更温馨，它也了解你的喜好，是个非常温暖的陪伴。
In addition, it is not just a tool, its entire intelligence, it will make you feel like a friend, travel with it will feel safer and warmer, it knows your preferences, it is a very warm companion.
燃财经：眼下车市低迷，新能源汽车由于补贴退坡等因素，也面临着很大的市场压力。
Flaming Finance: At present the automobile market is low, new energy vehicles due to subsidies downhill and other factors, also face great market pressure.
你认为2020年，新造车行业的市场格局会发生什么变化？什么样的企业会被淘汰？鲍毅：哪些新造车企业会存活下去？我觉得这个团队要真的懂得造车，另外资本非常重要，谁有足够的资本，谁就能挺过这个严冬。
What do you think will happen to the market pattern of the new car industry in 2020? What kind of enterprises will be eliminated? Bao: Which new car-building enterprises will survive? I think this team needs to really know how to build cars and capital is very important.
2020年新造车行业会发生很大变化。
The new car industry will change dramatically in 2020.
补贴取消是迟早的事情，这才是王者显现的时候，因为在商业化市场上，最终还是产品的优越性和性价比占主导，这才是客户购买你的原因。
It's only a matter of time before subsidies are eliminated, and that's when the king appears, because in the commercial market, the superiority and value for money of the product ultimately prevails, and that's why the customer buys you.
补贴取消会加速洗牌，谁真正在技术和产品上领先，谁真正在成本控制上领先，谁才能胜出。
The elimination of subsidies accelerates shuffling, who really leads in technology and products, who really leads in cost control, and who wins.
资本已经不盲目了，大家要找的是一个能够尽早产生利润、尽早能够赚钱的企业，赚钱才是资本投入的大道理。
Capital is not blind, we are looking for a profit as early as possible, can make money as soon as possible, making money is the main principle of capital investment.
燃财经：烧钱和亏损是新造车企业商业模式上最被诟病的一点，作为投资人，你认为新造车企业应该怎么打造自己的商业模式？如何控制烧钱节奏？如何实现盈利？鲍毅：我觉得这一波新造车企业，获得这么大的资本、造成这么大的亏损，给资本敲起了警钟，资本不能盲目投入。
As an investor, how do you think new car companies should build their own business model? How to control the tempo of burning money? How to make profits? Bao: I think this wave of new car-building enterprises, with so much capital and so much loss, has set off alarm bells for capital investment.
中国资本最大的一个问题是追风口，所有风口都是被资本追坏的。
One of the biggest problems with China's capital is wind chutes, all of which are chased by capital.
最终大家还是要回归到资本的原点，投资靠谱的市场、技术、团队和能够看得到盈利的商业模式。
Eventually, everyone will have to go back to the origin of capital, investing in niche markets, technology, teams, and profitable business models.
狼来了不可怕各自会有各自的舞台燃财经：在洗牌的过程中，特斯拉会扮演什么样的角色？去年以来，特斯拉在中国市场大展拳脚，不少人高喊“狼来了”，你认为威马等企业应该怎么学习特斯拉并且与之竞争？鲍毅：狼来了就来了，狼不是坏东西，只是大自然中存在的一个生物。
What role will Tesla play in the shuffle? Since last year, Tesla has been playing a big role in the Chinese market, shouting "Wolf is coming," how do you think companies like Weimar should learn Tesla and compete with him?
我们要学习马斯克充满创造力、勇于梦想、勇往直前的精神，马斯克不仅是个商人，更是一个疯狂的发明家、梦想家，这种精神对其他人会有好的影响。
We should learn from the creative, dream-driven and forward-looking spirit of Musk, not only a businessman, but also a crazy inventor and dreamer, which will have a positive effect on others.
特斯拉中国工厂将为中国的新能源汽车领域培养一批人才，汽车市场足够大，新能源汽车目前渗透率仅5%，足够几家优秀的企业来分这个市场，而且特斯拉的进入让消费者得到教育，让消费者更喜欢和了解新能源汽车。
The Tesla plant will train a pool of talent for China's new-energy vehicle industry, which is big enough to have a penetration rate of just 5%, enough for a few good companies to share the market, and Tesla's entry has educated consumers and made them more popular and knowledgeable about new energy vehicles.
将中国乃至全球新能源汽车市场做大做强，应该是特斯拉和其他新能源汽车企业的共同目标。
It should be the common goal of Tesla and other new energy automobile enterprises to make China and global new energy automobile market become bigger and stronger.
另外，特斯拉中国工厂短期内产能有限，年产量也就15万辆，2019年全国新能源汽车产销量已经达到120万辆，还不算今年的增量部分。
In addition, Tesla China has limited capacity in the short term, annual production of 150,000, 2019 new energy car production and sales have reached 1.2 million, not counting this year's increment.
所以特斯拉仅能满足市场需求的一部分，难以挤压到其他新能源车企的生存空间。
So Tesla can only meet a part of the market demand, difficult to squeeze into other new energy vehicles living space.
各自都有空间，各自都有舞台。
Each has its own space, each has its own stage.
我们既需要特斯拉这样的国外产业的领军企业，也需要、甚至更需要像威马这样的本土企业走向国际、引领未来。
We need leaders in foreign industries like Tesla, but also, and even more so, local companies like Waima to go global and lead the future.
燃财经：站在投资人的角度，你认为传统车企要想在新能源汽车上有所作为，有哪些困难要克服？你会投资传统车企的新造车业务吗？鲍毅：我觉得传统车企要想在新能源汽车上有所作为，需要克服它作为传统车企长久以来形成的惯性。
From an investor's point of view, what difficulties do you think traditional car companies will have to overcome if they want to be successful in new energy vehicles? Bao: I think if traditional car makers want to make a difference in new energy vehicles, they need to overcome their long-standing inertia as traditional car companies.
新造车势力有它崭新的面貌，传统造车企业有多年来积累的技术底蕴，对车的了解也不可复制，我相信新造车势力会涌现出一两家的引领者，同时整个新能源汽车产业的领军人物里也必定有许多传统车企的引领。
The new car power has its brand-new appearance, the traditional car-building enterprises have many years of accumulated technology, car knowledge can not be copied, I believe that the new car power will emerge one or two leaders, and the entire new energy industry leaders must have a lot of traditional car companies leading.
我们要投资的话，肯定注意他们新团队跟旧团队的区别，比如里面有没有互联网、人工智能、新销售这种思维的人。
If we're going to invest, be sure to notice the difference between their new team and the old team, for example, whether they have the Internet, artificial intelligence, or new people selling the idea.
投资加码加注不会被疫情吓倒燃财经：除了威马，沄柏资本还投资了做三元锂电池、甲醇燃料电池等方面的企业。
Investment bets will not be deterred by the epidemic: in addition to Waima, Compaq Capital has invested in businesses such as Lithium Three Batteries and Methanol Fuel Cells.
新能源汽车赛道的投资有何特点？你认为未来十年这个赛道能为投资人带来很好的回报吗？鲍毅：我个人非常看好新能源汽车赛道，未来肯定是多元新能源动力并存，既有动力电池的天下，也有甲醇燃料电池、超级电容的天下，最近我们刚刚完成了对超级电容企业的投资，特斯拉在新产品里面也用到了超级电容。
What are the characteristics of the new energy vehicle racetrack investment? Do you think this track will bring good returns to investors in the next 10 yearsBao: I personally look forward to the future of the new multi-energy vehicle circuit, the world of power batteries, methanol fuel cells, super capacitance.
动力电池过去五年增速非常迅猛，全球也推出了一些加速燃油车禁售的计划和规划，整个行业的特点是马太效应非常明显，动力电池的技术一定会快速迭代，与燃料电池、超级电容并驾齐驱。
Power batteries have grown at a phenomenal pace over the past five years, and there are plans and plans around the world to fast-track fuel-car sales. The industry is characterised by the Matthew effect, and power-cell technology is set to iterate quickly, alongside fuel cells and supercapacitors.
新能源汽车这个投资赛道我相信一定会有非常好的回报。
The new energy car investment circuit I believe there will be a very good return.
燃财经：2020年，沄柏资本最关注的产业有哪些？你对2020年创业投资的趋势有何判断？鲍毅：我的判断是，疫情让大家恐慌，在这个过程中，我们要做好充足准备，灾难之后就会有机会。
Flaming Finance: What are the industries that Compaq Capital cares about most in 2020? What is your judgment on the trend of venture capital investment in 2020? Bao: My judgment is that the epidemic scares everyone.
我觉得引领未来的工业4.0、人工智能、物联网、大数据、云计算的到来会更加速。
I think the advent of industry 4.0, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, big data, and cloud computing will accelerate.
这两个月我们完成了两项投资，我们只会加码加注，而不会被疫情暂时吓倒。
We've made two investments in the past two months, and we're only going to add a few bets without being temporarily deterred by the epidemic.
燃财经：募资困难、退出困难、好标的少，这是眼下投资机构需要面临的一些问题，沄柏资本怎么应对？鲍毅：募资困难是因为好的标的少、退出成绩不佳，现在投资机构面临的问题跟前几年不一样：几年前资本充足，所有估值蹭蹭蹭往上涨，在当前这种情况下，我认为不再是跟投、试运气的时候了，要去创造机会、制造协同，而不是简单的跟风和随众。
How do we deal with this problem? Bao: The difficulty in raising capital is due to the low number of good bids and poor exit achievements.Now the problem for investment organizations is not the same as in the past few years: A few years ago, capital was abundant, all valuations dawdled upwards.
跟其他投资机构有所区别的是，从一开始我们就在创造投资机会，看到好的团队和好的趋势，把它们组合起来。
Unlike other investment institutions, we create investment opportunities from the start, see good teams and good trends, and combine them.
世界越是分裂、越是渐行渐远，我们就要把世界拉的更近。
The more divided and distant the world becomes, the closer we are to bringing it closer.
