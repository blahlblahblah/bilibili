3月以来归国人数不断增加　　3月以来，中国以外新冠肺炎确诊病例不断攀升。
The number of cases of newly diagnosed pneumonia outside China has been on the rise since March.
目前，中国以外共151个国家和地区出现确诊病例。
At present, there are 151 confirmed cases in countries and regions other than China.
截至欧洲中部时间16日10时(北京时间16日17时)，中国以外新冠肺炎确诊病例较前一日增加13874例，达到86434例；死亡病例较前一日增加848例，达到3388例。
As of 1000 CET (17: 00 Beijing time), the number of confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia outside China had increased by 13,874 to 86,434 compared with the previous day, and the number of deaths had increased by 848 to 3,388 over the previous day.
受此影响，不少海外华侨和留学生考虑回国躲避疫情，这催生了大量市场需求。
Affected by this, many overseas Chinese and foreign students consider returning home to escape the epidemic, which has led to a large market demand.
“美国、意大利、西班牙、英国等国近期出现了一波归国潮。
"Countries such as the United States, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom have seen a recent wave of returns.
”携程数据显示，3月以来，预订自意大利、伊朗、西班牙、美国、瑞典回国的机票订单一直呈现增长态势。
Ticket orders from Italy, Iran, Spain, the US and Sweden have been on the rise since March, according to Ctrip.
相较3月2日-3月8日，3月9日-3月15日上述5个国家出行人次增长近2倍。
Compared to March 2-8 March, March 9-March 15, the number of trips in the five above-mentioned countries nearly tripled.
如，比较3月15日与3月1日的机票价格和出行情况发现，3月15日的出行人次比3月1日增长了近5倍，平均价格增长了近1.5倍。
For example, a comparison of flight prices and trips between March 15 and March 1 shows that the number of trips on March 15 increased nearly fivefold compared with March 1, and the average price increased nearly 1.5-fold.
除了上述国家，携程称，日本、韩国、新加坡、新西兰、澳大利亚等多数国家的机票平均价格近期也出现了不同幅度的同比增长。
In addition to the above-mentioned countries, Ctrip said most countries, including Japan, South Korea, Singapore, New Zealand and Australia, have seen their average air ticket prices increase by different margins in the recent past.
欧洲-中国的航班机票人均价格走势。
Euro-China airline tickets per capita price trend.
(截至3月12日)　　回国机票涨价，仍一票难求　　市场需求不小，但航班供给却在减少。
Return airfare rises March 12, still a hard demand market demand, but the supply of flights is decreasing.
比如中美航线上的美国航司已经停飞所有美国到中国内地的直飞航线，国航和东航仅保留了从美国东海岸和西海岸到中国的各一班航班，这也使得欧美回国航班运力不足。
For example, the US Air Services Department on the China-US route has suspended all direct flights from the US to the mainland, and Air China and China Eastern have retained only one flight each from the east coast and west coast of the US to China, leaving little capacity for repatriation flights from the US and Europe.
供需矛盾之下，乘客要从欧美飞往中国需要付出的成本显著提高。
Under the contradiction between supply and demand, the cost of flying passengers from Europe and America to China has increased dramatically.
据去哪儿网数据显示，在过去的一周，美国各地返回国内的机票均价上涨47.6%，欧洲各地返回国内的机票价格上涨74.3%。
Over the past week, the average price of tickets returned home has risen 47.6 per cent across the United States and 74.3 per cent across Europe, according to data on the Internet.
记者16日查询在线票务平台发现，3月份伦敦-上海的机票价格在4000-24000元之间，明显高于往常。
Ticket prices for London-Shanghai were between 4,000 and 24,000 yuan (US $381 billion) in March, a much higher-than-usual figure, the online ticketing platform found.
未来的机票价格如何？3月16日到3月22日机票价格均超过20000元，且仅有一个班次可选，而3月31日这天有大约50个航班可供选择，最低价格为4318元，但最高的公务舱价格近5万元。
Tickets are priced at over 20,000 yuan each from March 16 to March 22, and there is only one flight available. On March 31, there are about 50 available, with a minimum price of $4,318, but the highest business-class fare is nearly $50,000.

不仅如此，据去哪儿网平台数据显示，在未来的一周内，欧美主要城市飞往北京、上海的直飞航班已经售罄。
Not only that, but within the next week, non-stop flights to Beijing and Shanghai from major cities in the U.S. and Europe have been sold out, according to Web-based platform data.
具体来说，伦敦返回国内的航班最难买，除香港外，伦敦至北京、上海、广州、成都直飞航线基本售罄，3月18日，由伦敦至香港的直飞航班含税最低52313元。
Specifically, flights from London back home are the most difficult to buy. Apart from Hong Kong, direct flights from London to Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chengdu are almost all sold out.
180000元一张的机票，照样火速售罄　　买不到普通民航机票，包机成为一种价格高昂的选择。
With 180,000 yuan for every ticket sold out and no regular airline tickets available, charter flights are a costly option.
近日，一张由波音787公务机执飞的伦敦飞往上海的海报传遍朋友圈。
A poster of Boeing 787 official planes flying from London to Shanghai has spread to friends recently.
海报信息显示，这趟航班每个座位售价18万元起，仅有40个座位。
Poster messages showed the flight was priced at $180,000 each, with only 40 seats.
这班公务机在放票后不久即售罄。
The official flight was sold out shortly after ticketing.
运营商金鹿公务表示，这架公务机收到了100多个预定需求，主要来自伦敦。
Operator Jinlu said the aircraft received more than 100 scheduled demand, mainly from London.
公开资料显示，金鹿公务是海航集团旗下航空公司，是国内从事专业公务机租赁、私人飞机托管、公务机地面代理和维护、空中医疗救援以及私人飞机购买咨询等服务的运营商。
According to the public information, Jinlu is the carrier of HNA Group, which is engaged in the domestic professional business aircraft rental, private aircraft hosting, official aircraft ground agent and maintenance, aeromedical rescue and private aircraft purchase consulting services.
金鹿公务介绍，“787梦想商务机最高可容纳40人出行，内部配备了客厅、客舱、主卧、主卧衣帽间、主卧盥洗室和厨房。
"The 787 dream business jet can accommodate up to 40 passengers and has a living room, cabin, master bedroom, master bedroom, main washroom and kitchen," the company said
”“专门制定七星级的服务标准，提供一对一‘旅行管家’服务”。
"Special seven-star service standards to provide one-on-one 'travel housekeeping' services."

Official jet is a form of chartered aircraft that is customized to meet the needs of charters and is significantly more expensive than regular civilian airliners, according to experts.
民航专家綦琦告诉记者：“以金鹿航空伦敦飞上海使用的787飞机为例，普通航班的头等舱+公务舱+经济舱布局提供250个座位，而公务机布局仅40个座位，所以会用头等舱或更高价格进行定价。
Qiqi, an aviation expert told reporters: "Take the example of the 787 aircraft used by Jinlu London to fly to Shanghai, ordinary flights offer 250 seats in first class + business class + economy class, while the business layout is only 40 seats, so pricing will be made in first class or higher.
同时包机是单向运行，还涉及到调机费等，所以价格会比一般民航客机的价格高。
At the same time the charter is a one-way operation, but also involves the transfer fee, so the price will be higher than the average civilian passenger aircraft prices.
”　　金鹿公务总经理运启骥在接受媒体采访时表示，春节期间，金鹿公务的生产并未中断，由于公务机行业的特殊性，航班数量反而有所增加。
Ji Ji, general manager of Jinlu's official business, said in an interview with the media that the company's production of official business had not been interrupted during the Spring Festival and that the number of flights had increased due to the particularity of the business sector.
有一些客户原来是搭乘大航班头等舱出行，现在因为公务机的私密性与灵活性强，转而选择公务机包机飞行。
A number of clients who used to travel first class on large flights are now opting for business charter flights because of the privacy and flexibility of official flights.
这部分新增业务给航班减少带来了一些弥补。
This additional business has made up for some of the reduction in flights.
据私人飞机平台iFlyPlus数据分析，3月初，受亚洲、欧洲、北美等地疫情发展的影响，生活在海外的企业家及移民、留学生等咨询客户越来越多来电询问包机事宜，他们正在时刻观察疫情走势，考虑择日回到疫情得到逐步控制的中国。
According to the analysis of iFly Plus, a private aircraft platform, due to the development of the epidemic in Asia, Europe and North America in early March, more and more overseas entrepreneurs and consulting clients such as immigrants and foreign students are calling to ask about charter flights.

From January to March, the share of its offshore registered users in the total number of users will increase from the previous 11 per cent to 19 per cent.
国际航班逐步复苏　　受疫情影响，2月份中国民航业亏损创历史记录。
The gradual recovery of international flights was affected by the epidemic, with China's civil aviation industry recording record losses in February.
民航局为帮助企业渡过难关，出台了一系列税费减免优惠，还推出了更直接的奖励政策。
Civil Aviation Administration to help enterprises overcome difficulties, introduced a series of tax relief concessions, but also introduced more direct incentive policies.
3月4日，民航局宣布对疫情期间不停航和复航的国际航班给予奖励。
On 4 March, the Civil Aviation Authority announced incentives for non-stop and resumed international flights during the outbreak.
奖励标准分成两档：共飞航班每座公里0.0176元，独飞航班每座公里0.0528元，政策执行期限为2020年1月23日至2020年6月30日。
The award criteria are divided into two stages: 0.0176 yuan per kilometre for each flight and 0.0528 yuan per kilometre for solo flights, with a policy period of 23 January 2020 to 30 June 2020.
在奖励政策和市场需求的推动下，航空公司正在逐渐恢复部分国际航线。
Driven by incentive policies and market demand, airlines are gradually resuming some international routes.
南航计划逐步恢复广州至澳新、北美、欧洲、东南亚等多个地区的国际客运航班，其中欧洲航线方面，从3月22日起，南航计划将广州至伦敦航线恢复至每周4班，每周1、3、5、7执行。
China Southern plans to gradually restore international passenger flights from Guangzhou to New Zealand, North America, Europe and Southeast Asia.

东航方面从3月15日起恢复了多条国际航线。
China Eastern resumed international flights on March 15.
其中欧洲航线上恢复了浦东-巴黎、浦东-阿姆斯特丹、浦东-法兰克福、浦东-伦敦等航线。
Among these routes, Pudong-Paris, Pudong-Amsterdam, Pudong-Frankfurt and Pudong-London were restored.
国际航班多，北京、上海严防疫情境外输入　　目前入境国际航班仍然较分散，防范疫情境外输入的压力仍然较大。
More international flights, Beijing and Shanghai to strictly prevent the importation of international flights into the country is still relatively scattered, the pressure to prevent the importation of epidemic outside the still greater pressure.
飞常准数据显示，3月14日国内承接疫区航班的机场数量达到10个，其中首都机场疫区航班量最多，达到8个；上海两机场以5个疫区航班量位居第二。
According to statistics, on March 14, the number of airports in China receiving flights from affected areas reached 10, with the capital having the highest number of flights, with eight, and Shanghai having the second highest number of flights in five affected areas.
此外，广州白云、哈尔滨太平、延吉朝阳川以日均2个疫区航班量排名第三。
In addition, Guangzhou Baiyun, Harbin Taiping, Yanji Chaoyang Chuan ranked third in the daily average of 2 affected areas.

国航海外疫情防控组成员张允15日介绍称，3月1日至3月15日滚动统计，国航“境外进京”航班在登机前因体温超标暂不运输旅客76人，涉及23个航班；国航机组执行境外进京航班，飞行途中检测体温超标落地移交检疫67人(涉及44个航班)。
Zhang Yun-15, a member of Air China's overseas epidemic prevention and control programme, said: "From March 1 to March 15, statistics show that Air China's" overseas flights to Beijing "will not transport 76 passengers or 23 flights because of excessive body temperature before boarding.
为有效防范境外疫情的输入和扩散，北京15日起，首都机场全部国际及港澳台地区进港航班，均停靠首都机场T3D处置专区。
In order to effectively prevent the importation and spread of epidemic diseases abroad, all international and Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan inbound flights of the Capital Airport have stopped at the T3D disposal area of the Capital Airport since 15.
从3月16日零时起，所有境外进京人员，均应转送至集中观察点进行14天的隔离观察。
From 0000 hours on 16 March, all foreign visitors should be transferred to a centralized observation point for a 14-day quarantine.
有特殊情况的，经严格评估，可进行居家观察。
In special circumstances, after a rigorous evaluation, home observation may be carried out.
集中隔离观察期间，隔离人员费用需要自理。

上海则要求，3月13日零点起，凡是在进入上海之日前14天内，有过韩国、意大利、伊朗、日本、法国、西班牙、德国、美国等国家旅行或居住史的所有中外人员，一律实施居家或集中隔离健康观察。
Shanghai requires all Chinese and foreign personnel with a history of travel or residence in Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan, France, Spain, Germany and the United States to carry out home-based or centralized health observation within 14 days before the date of entering Shanghai.
“随着类似北京的对入境人士的隔离措施实施，回国需求应该会有所下降。
"There should be a decline in demand for repatriation as a result of immigration restrictions such as Beijing's.
毕竟，控制疫情蔓延的最好办法是就地自我隔离，而不是各种流动。
After all, the best way to control the spread of the epidemic is to isolate yourself locally, rather than through mobility.
