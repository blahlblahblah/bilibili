这段时间，生活乱糟糟的，整天不是担心这个就是害怕那个，三个亲人隔离，我一个人带着两个娃度日，本来可以是悠然的居家时光，却因为疫情让我这个家步履维艰。
This time, life is chaotic, all day is either worried about this or afraid of that, three relatives separated, I live alone with two babies, could be a leisurely time at home, but because of the epidemic my family is struggling.
口述 | 叶子（化名）整理 | 黄祺今天是我33岁的生日——20200220，看起来多么好的数字，但我却要疯了。
WONG QI & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; Today is my thirty-third birthday - 20200220.
早上居委会给我电话，要求我带着两个孩子去集中隔离点，原因是我们一家6口人，已经有3人之前被确诊为新冠肺炎患者。
The neighborhood committee called me in the morning to ask me and my two children to concentrate on the quarantine because three of our family, three of whom had been previously diagnosed with New Crown Pneumonia.
现在我的父母和老公都在方舱医院和集中隔离点，我和孩子们是我家的“幸存者”。
Now my parents and husband are in the cabin hospital and the concentrated isolation points, my children and I are the "survivors" of my family.
我们没有任何症状，而且我妈妈是最后一个离开家的，她离开家已经12天了。
We didn't have any symptoms, and my mother was the last one to leave home. She had been away for 12 days.
我们已经12天没有和病人接触过，我觉得我们没有被传染。
We haven't had any contact with patients in 12 days, and I don't think we're infected.
叶子一家我希望继续在家隔离，我两个孩子一个3岁一个6岁，平常抵抗力就不好，我害怕到集中隔离点，反而被别人传染了。
Leaf family I want to continue isolation, my two children a 3-year-old and a 6-year-old, the normal resistance is not good, I fear the concentration of isolation points, but someone else infected.
我跟居委会反映了我家里的情况，但他们说根据现在的规定，我们必须去。
I told the neighborhood committee about my family, but they said we had to go according to the rules.
昨天我设想着，今天在家自己动手给自己做个蛋糕，和两个女儿度过这个特殊的生日，跟爸爸妈妈和老公视频问候一下。
Yesterday I imagined making myself a cake at home today, spending my special birthday with my two daughters, greeting my parents and husband on video.
我连生日愿望都想好了：“希望我的家人都健康平安！！”现在，我在清理东西、打包……叶子带两个孩子去隔离点社区算是照顾我们，联系了一辆轿车送我们一大两小去隔离点，不然就要坐大巴。
I even thought about my birthday wish: "I hope my family is healthy and safe!!" Now, I'm cleaning, packing... Leaves take two kids to the quarantine point community to take care of us, contact a car to send us to the isolation point, or take a bus.
老公发烧、妈妈咳嗽、爸爸发烧我家第一个发烧的是我老公。
My husband has a fever, my mother coughs, my father has a fever My first fever is my husband.
除夕之前2天，我老公单位放假，假期里我们几乎所有的时间都在一起，所以至今都不知道他是怎么被传染的。
2 days before New Year's Eve, my husband's work unit holiday, we spend almost all the time together, so until now, do not know how he was infected.
除夕，我们小家庭在家里吃了年饭，晚上孩子们还看了春节晚会。
On New Year's Eve, our little family ate New Year's Eve at home. In the evening, the children also watched the Spring Festival Gala.
直到那时，我们都觉得病毒离我们还遥远，毕竟我们住在和汉口隔了条江的武昌。
Until then, we all felt that the virus was still far away from us. After all, we lived in Wuchang, which is separated from Hankou by a river.
1月26日上午，老公突然发烧了，没有其他症状，就是头晕乏力，烧得也不高，不到38度，当时我还是挺担心的，让他戴着口罩，吃家里常备的中药，治疗感冒和调理脾胃抗病毒的。
January 26 morning, my husband suddenly feverish, no other symptoms, is dizziness and fatigue, burning not high, less than 38 degrees, I was still worried, let him wear a mask, eat Chinese medicine available at home, treatment of the cold and stomach antiviral treatment.
第二天老公烧退了。
The next day my husband burned out.
1月29日晚上，老公又开始发烧37.7度，他说可能是洗完澡穿少了有点冷。
On the night of Jan. 29, my husband had a fever of 37.7 degrees. He said it might be a little cold after taking a bath.
当晚我们就让他独自隔离，把卧室让给他一个人睡，大女儿在书房睡小床，我和小女儿爸妈挤在次卧的高低床。
That night we left him alone, leaving the bedroom to him alone, the eldest daughter sleeping in the study bunk, and my little daughter and my parents huddled in the next bedroom.
1月30日老公最高烧到38.3度。
My husband burned to 38.3 degrees on January 30th.
从1月29号到2月2日老公一直反复低烧，没有咳嗽，状态基本正常，精神不错，饭也正常吃了，就说吃东西尝不到味道。
From January 29 to February 2 her husband has repeatedly low fever, no cough, the state is basically normal, the spirit is good, the meal also normal eating, said that eating food can not taste.
那时候武汉的规定是让大家居家隔离，因为老公症状不重，而且当时已经知道，去医院也很危险，所以我们就决定继续在家隔离。
The Wuhan regulation was to keep people at home isolated because the husband's symptoms were not serious and it was already known that going to the hospital was dangerous, so we decided to stay at home.
第二个有症状的可能是我妈妈。
The second symptom may be my mother.
1月27日初三我妈妈去了趟超市，买了瓜子回来，吃的时候有点呛到，从那天开始我妈妈就偶尔有点咳嗽，因为以前也有发过支气管炎，当时她也以为是支气管炎，吃了气管炎的药。
January 27, my mother went to the supermarket, bought melon seeds back, eat a bit choke, from that day on my mother occasionally coughed, because of previous bronchitis, she also thought it was bronchitis, took medicine for bronchitis.
后来几天我妈精神没平时好，不知道是不是担心，她基本上一个人待在她房间不怎么出来，我爸爸戴着口罩做饭，我们全家都戴着口罩。
The next few days my mom wasn't in her usual good spirits and I don't know if she was worried. She didn't come out of her room alone. My father was cooking with a mask.
我直到现在依然每天戴着口罩，连睡觉都没脱。
I still wear a mask every day and I don't even take my bed off.
现在回想起来，我妈妈不舒服那几天，我也有头闷乏力的状态，我爸爸也是说闷，以为是每天戴着口罩宅在家的缘故。
In retrospect, my mother was uncomfortable for a few days, I also have a dull state, my father is also said boring, think that every day wearing a mask at home.
那几天晚上我睡觉的时候有明显感觉到胸部的刺痛，而且畏寒，睡觉要盖多一点才舒服，但是半夜会突然因为头上的虚汗而醒过来，现在想想，可能是病毒已经开始要复制了，然后我就开始给自己灌中药，大概3天之后，胸部刺痛和虚汗消失了。
I felt the sting of my chest when I went to bed the other night, and I was afraid of the cold and wanted to sleep a little more. But I woke up in the middle of the night with a sweat on my head.
幸好我一直连睡觉都戴着口罩，才没有让一直跟我睡的小女儿有事。
Luckily, I've been wearing a mask to keep my little daughter from sleeping with me.
到了2月2日，老公每天下午低烧37.3的样子，我爸爸也突然发烧了，一下就38.5。
On February 2, my husband had a low fever of 37.3 every afternoon, and my father suddenly had a fever, just 38.5.
爸爸曾因为高烧不退住院一个多月，没查出病因，所以每次爸爸发烧我们就特别担心。
Dad was hospitalized because of a high fever for more than a month, did not identify the cause of illness, so every time our father has a fever we are particularly worried.
以“疑似病人”身份进了隔离点2月2日那天晚上，老公和我爸爸妈妈一起去了武汉科技大学天佑医院，希望能做核酸检测确诊一下。
As a "suspected patient" into the quarantine point February 2, my husband and my mother and father together went to Wuhan University of Science and Technology Tianyou Hospital, hoping to do a nucleic acid test confirmed.
他们直到半夜两点多才从医院回来，医院没有试剂盒，没有做成核酸检测。
They did not return from the hospital until more than 2 a.m. The hospital did not have a kit and did not have a nucleic acid test.
我爸爸和我老公都查了血、拍了CT，老公双肺感染，但是血项报告不算太严重；我爸爸右下肺感染。
My father and my husband both checked the blood, took a CT, and my husband had a two-lung infection, but the blood item was not too serious; my father had a right lower lung infection.
按照诊断标准，他们都是新冠肺炎，但当时必须要核酸检测阳性才算，爸爸和老公只能算疑似病人。
By diagnostic criteria, they were all newly diagnosed with pneumonia, but had to be nucleic acid-positive to count, father and husband can only be suspected patients.
我们想住院，或者去隔离点。
We want to be hospitalized or quarantined.
我连夜拨打社区、街道和洪山区公布的各种电话号码，他们的回复是：确诊了才能集中隔离，疑似病人居家隔离。
When I dialed various phone numbers posted in communities, streets and Hongshan overnight, they responded that only when people were diagnosed could they be isolated, and suspected patients could be isolated at home.
可是我家有两个小孩，小孩子很难做到关在房间里不出门啊。
But my family has two children, it is difficult for children to shut up in the room do not go out.
而且我父母住在同一间，也不能有独自的房间隔离。
And my parents live in the same room, and they can't have a separate room.
我当时真的很崩溃。
I was really crashing.
妈妈到医院也要求医生做CT检查，但医生说只是咳嗽没事，妈妈当天没有做任何检查就回来了。
Mother to the hospital also asked the doctor for a CT examination, but the doctor said only cough is all right, mother did not do any examination on the day back.
在我不断的求助下，2月3日，社区终于帮我们联系了隔离点，可以让我爸爸先去隔离点，然后在那里做核酸测试。
With my constant help, on February 3, the community finally got us in touch with the quarantine, allowing my father to go to the quarantine site and then do a nucleic acid test there.
3日夜晚，我爸爸被送到了位于白沙三路的洪山区委党校隔离点，这是当时洪山区唯一的隔离点，社区说还是加急了才送去的。
On the night of March 3, my father was sent to the Hongshan Party School isolation point on Pak Sha Road, the only isolation point in the Hongshan area at that time.
去之前，社区反复向我们确认，说保证病情不是很重，不能是那种很危险的病人，因为隔离点没有医生，他们很害怕去了重病人，没办法处理。
Before we went, the community repeatedly confirmed to us that the guarantee was not too serious to be a very dangerous patient, because there was no doctor in the quarantine site and they were afraid to go to the seriously ill and could not handle it.
2月4日我爸爸做了第一次核酸测试，当天他不发烧了，我老公吃了医院的药也没有再发烧。
On February 4, my father had his first nucleic acid test, and that day he had no fever. My husband took the hospital medicine and did not have a fever.
差点被隔离点拒收的妈妈我妈妈心理安慰了一些，状态也好了一点，但还是咳嗽，有时候会喘不过气来。
My mother, who was close to being rejected by the quarantine, consoled her a little, but she still coughed and sometimes lost her breath.
妈妈本身有心脏病，做过心脏消融手术，又有轻微房颤，所以那几天我们关注的焦点变成了我妈妈。
My mother herself had a heart attack, a heart ablation operation and a mild atrial fibrillation, so the focus of our attention these days turned to my mother.
我家的体温计被爸爸带到隔离点去了，2月7日下午我收拾东西的时候发现了一个体温计，就让妈妈量一量体温。
My thermometer had been taken to the quarantine by my father, and on the afternoon of February 7, when I was packing, I found a thermometer and asked my mother to take a temperature measurement.
她自己没感觉，但一量是37.8度。
She didn't feel it herself, but it was 37.8 degrees.
我们都觉得不妙，我妈妈很少感冒发烧，这次突然发烧让我们意识到，可能我妈妈也被感染了。
We both felt bad. My mother rarely had a cold or a fever, and the sudden fever made us realize that maybe my mother was infected, too.
家里就剩下我，要坚持住照顾两个年幼的孩子。
I was the only one left in my family to hold on to my two young children.
我妈妈说她最好也去隔离，对我和孩子都好，毕竟这个病毒传染力太强。
My mom said she'd better go quarantine, too. It's good for me and the kids. After all, the virus is too contagious.
于是我又开始了向社区、街道甚至《人民日报》求助。
So I started asking the community, the streets and even the People's Daily for help.
街道的干部跟我说，我妈妈连一份血检和CT报告都没有，隔离点实在很难安排，至少要是疑似患者才能送去隔离，但是社区又没有办法帮我送妈妈去医院做检查。
Street officials told me that my mother didn't have a blood test or a CT report, that the quarantine was difficult to arrange, at least if the patient was suspected, but there was no way the community could take my mother to the hospital for a check-up.
那几天我每天要做四个人的饭，做各种清洁消毒工作，还要想办法哄着两个女儿尽量留在房间不要到客厅去，晚上又担心妈妈一个人在房间有没有呼吸困难睡不好，我感觉甚是疲惫。
I had to cook for four people a day, do all sorts of cleaning and disinfecting, try to coax my two daughters to stay in the room as much as possible, and worry at night about my mother having trouble breathing and sleeping alone in the room.
2月8日，妈妈去医院拍了CT,结果显示双肺感染。
On February 8, my mother went to the hospital for a CT scan, which showed a two-lung infection.
社区算是照顾我们，让我妈妈去了爸爸那个隔离点。
The community took care of us and let my mom go to dad's seclusion.
住进去之前，妈妈问隔离点工作人员：“如果有呼吸困难找谁求助？”这一问，把工作人员吓得，差点不收她。
Before she moved in, her mother asked the staff at the quarantine point, "Who can help if I have difficulty breathing?" The question scared the staff out of accepting her.
因为他们没有医护人员，不能保证安全。
Because they don't have paramedics, they're not safe.
当时已经很晚了，送我妈妈的车把她放下就走了，我妈妈拖着疲惫的身躯，向社区求助，夜里2点多才最终被收了进去。
It was very late and my mother's car took her down and she left. My mother dragged herself to the community for help. It was just after 2: 00 pm that she was finally admitted.
2月9日，妈妈说隔离点发了中药，他们晚上开始喝中药了。
February 9, mother said the isolation point issued Chinese medicine, they began to drink Chinese medicine at night.
我爸爸做了两次核酸，第一次阴，第二次阳性，我妈妈的咳嗽越来越重了。
My father made two nucleic acids, the first time Yin, the second time positive, my mother's cough is getting heavier and heavier.
第二天下午，爸爸又开始发烧。
The next afternoon my father began to have a fever again.
本来已经有四五天没有发烧，而且他这次一烧就是38度，我妈妈也每天到下午发烧到38度左右，再加上咳嗽厉害，在隔离点没有医护人员询问，她的精神越来越差，担心自己又担心爸爸，她已经处于崩溃的边缘。
There had been no fever for four or five days, and he had a fever of 38 degrees this time, and my mother had a fever of about 38 degrees every afternoon, combined with a bad cough, no medical check-ups at the quarantine site, her spirits were deteriorating and she feared for her father, who was on the verge of collapse.
爸妈进了方舱医院2月11日，爸妈依然发烧。
Mom and Dad entered the cabin hospital Feb. 11, and my parents still had a fever.
妈妈迫切地想要住进医院，仿佛只有看到医生她才有救。
Mother desperately wanted to be admitted to the hospital, as if seeing a doctor would save her.
我跟社区、街道联系，他们都说要根据核酸结果才能有下一步安排，而公布的洪山区的电话又根本联系不上。
I talked to the community, the streets, and they all said they needed nucleic acid results in order to be able to make the next move.
那天晚上，我在网上发布了求助的信息，有志愿者加我问了我爸妈的情况，他说帮我报上去可能有安排床位的希望，我半夜还在跟志愿者们说明情况，但也许是因为我父母没有高血压和冠心病这样严重的基础疾病，也没有到呼吸困难缺氧，所以即使报上去也只是排在比较后面。
That night, I posted help messages on the Internet. Volunteers and I asked about my parents, he said he might have a bed arrangement for me, and I was explaining to the volunteers in the middle of the night, but probably because my parents didn't have a basic illness like high blood pressure or coronary heart disease or lack of oxygen to breathe.
当时我除了要照顾孩子们，做好日常消毒之外，我的压力也非常大，生怕爸妈出现什么不测，我又无法帮上忙。
In addition to taking care of the children and doing the routine disinfection, I was under a lot of pressure. I was afraid of what would happen to my parents.
2月12日，爸妈的核酸测试都是阳性，这也许是好事。
On Feb. 12, both parents tested positive for nucleic acid, which may be a good thing.
当天的政策已经变成“应收尽收”，确诊患者都要得到相应救治。
The day's policy has become "receivable", confirmed patients have to be treated accordingly.
当天，隔离点通知我爸妈会被转走，但是没有人知道去哪里。
On the same day, my parents were notified of the transfer, but no one knew where to go.
一开始我妈妈听说去方舱医院没有人管，没有药，条件还很差，所以很抗拒去方舱医院。
At first my mother heard that going to Fang Cao Hospital was deserted. There was no medicine and the condition was very bad. So she resisted going to the Fang Cao Hospital.
经过我们的劝说，妈妈终于平复心情，接受了可能会去方舱医院的事实。
After our persuasion, my mother finally calmed down and accepted the fact that she might go to the cabin hospital.
收治叶子父母的方舱医院晚上9点，身处洪山区的爸妈被送到了位于汉阳的武汉体育中心方舱医院。
At 9 p. m., my parents' cabin hospital in Hongshan district was sent to Wuhan Sports Center Fang Cao Hospital in Hanyang.
2月13日，爸爸妈妈仍然是到下午晚上开始发烧，半夜虚汗不停慢慢退烧，爸爸烧得比较高，几次都要吃退烧药降温，方舱的医生说他的药已经吃了近10天了，副作用太多，让他不要再吃，叫我妈妈最好也不要吃药了。
Feb. 13, my parents are still feverish in the afternoon, sweat slowly in the middle of the night, father burning high, several times to take antipyretic cooling, the cabin doctor said that his medicine has been eaten for nearly 10 days, too side effects, let him not to eat, my mother had better not take medicine.
但我爸爸还在发烧，我和妈妈都很不放心。
But my father still has a fever, and my mother and I are very uneasy.
2月14日，也在这一天，我妈妈没有发烧了，胃口也好多了，但是咳嗽还是厉害，而且咳狠了还是会喘。
On February 14, the same day, my mother had no fever and had a better appetite, but she still coughed badly and coughed harder and gasped.
我觉得是方舱医院的环境让她心态有所转好，毕竟那里那么多跟她一样的患者，大家可以相互交流，时间过得也快一些，比起一个人在隔离点胡思乱想到崩溃，方舱医院的环境确实更适合患者的调养。
I think it was the circumstances of the cabin hospital that made her feel better. After all, there were so many patients like her, people could communicate with each other and time passed faster.
叶子父母拍的方舱医院患者盒饭2月15日，武汉下起了大雪，2020年的第一场雪，来得确实晚了一点。
Boxed lunch for patients at the cabin hospital in Wuhan Feb. 15, the snow began to snow in Wuhan, the first snow in 2020, came a little late indeed.
这一天，爸妈都没有再发烧了，爸爸状态平稳，妈妈还是咳嗽厉害，但是心态已经好多了。
This day, parents do not have a fever any more, Dad is in a stable state, mother still coughing badly, but the mentality has been much better.
这个艰难自救的冬天老公从2月12日去了一个酒店隔离点，在隔离点做的第一次核酸测试是阴性，距离他回来的日子近了一点儿，我整个人都感觉轻松了一些，一直揪着的心也稍稍放下了一些。
The difficult self-help winter husband went to a hotel seclusion on February 12, the first nucleic acid test done at the isolation point was negative, a little closer to his return, and I felt a little relaxed and a little relieved.
这段时间，生活乱糟糟的，整天不是担心这个就是害怕那个，三个亲人隔离，我一个人带着两个娃度日，本来可以是悠然的居家时光，却因为疫情让我这个家步履维艰。
This time, life is chaotic, all day is either worried about this or afraid of that, three relatives separated, I live alone with two babies, could be a leisurely time at home, but because of the epidemic my family is struggling.
2月17日，小区被彻底封锁，不让出去，买菜成为了新的问题，大家只能在群里到处拼团，或者等着六七天才来一次的爱心卖菜队伍进入小区，然后排着长长的队伍买菜。
On February 17, the neighborhood was completely blocked from going out, and buying food became a new problem. People had to flock together in groups or wait for six or seven days before a loving team of vegetable vendors entered the community and lined up to buy food.
非常感谢几位邻居朋友的青菜援助，让我和孩子们原本天天吃大白菜的日子能够换上口味。
Thank you very much for your help with the vegetables from some of my neighbors, so that my children and I could change our Chinese cabbage tastes every day.
2月19日，妈妈已经5天不发烧了，但是咳嗽还是厉害，爸爸也有4天不发烧了，其他症状也都还好。
Feb. 19, the mother has not had a fever for five days, but the cough is still severe, Dad has four days no fever, other symptoms are also good.
老公两次核酸检测都是阴性，基本上没有任何不适的症状，但是隔离点没有能让他回来的意思。
Husband two nucleic acid tests are negative, basically no symptoms of discomfort, but the isolation point did not mean to let him back.
我妈妈很不安，担心他们把我也弄去隔离，那两个孩子就无人照料。
My mother was worried that they would isolate me, too, and the two children would be left alone.
社区跟我联系过多次，说上级的要求是我也应该去隔离点，但是我一次又一次跟她们强调我的实际情况，我没有任何不适，两个孩子也都好，并且需要得到照顾，所以她们也没有强制要求我去。
The community contacted me many times, saying that my superiors demanded that I should go to the quarantine, but I repeated to them that I was fine, that my two children were well and needed to be taken care of, so they did not force me to go either.
今天，我们一大两小还是去隔离点了。
Today, our big and small or go to the isolation point.
令人欣慰的是，街道的人看我情况困难，申请把我们3个转移到一家酒店隔离了。
Thankfully, the people on the street saw me in a difficult situation and applied to have our three moved to a hotel and quarantined.
