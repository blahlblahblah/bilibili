澎湃新闻记者 薛莎莎 实习生 王月伦赵智刚拎着蔬菜水果，来到家门口，放下东西，他给妻子沈杨发了条信息，让她带着俩女儿出来拿，他站在十米开外，远远的看一眼女儿们。

本文图片由受访者提供赵智刚叮嘱几句，告诉孩子们他把外面的病人都治好了就能回家。
Zhao Zhigang was asked by the interviewee to tell the children that he could go home after he cured the patients outside.
前后约一分钟，他就转身走了，科室还有很多工作等着他处理。
About a minute before and after, he turned away, and there was still a lot of work to be done in the department.
这一幕常发生在武汉大学中南医院急救中心副主任医师赵智刚家门口。
This scene often happened in Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital Emergency Medical Center deputy director Zhao Zhigang door.
自疫情开始，他就坚守在医院的重症隔离病房，带领全组人员奋战一线。
Since the outbreak began, he has held on to the hospital's intensive care unit, leading the team to the frontline.
1月20日，他被确诊新冠肺炎，因不想占用床位，他拿了药回宿舍隔离治疗。
On 20 January, he was diagnosed with pneumonia and, unwilling to occupy his bed, returned to the dorm for isolation.
自我隔离康复后，他主动请缨返岗，和组员们并肩作战。
After self-isolation and rehabilitation, he volunteered to return home to fight side by side with the team.
赵智刚说，自己并非公众口中的“英雄”，只是做了医生该做的事。
Zhao Zhigang said he was not a "hero" in the public, just did what doctors should do.
他没有沉溺于媒体和公众的“点赞”，他更多是反思：同事们多有感染，在疫情来临前期，他们在诊治和管理上出现了什么问题？2月19日晚，在与澎湃新闻记者（www.thepaper.cn）的交谈中，赵智刚多次强调，面对自然界给人类带来的新疾病、新挑战，市民、医护人员、卫生体系工作者都要“尊重自然规律”，只有用科学的态度对待它，才能打赢这场无硝烟的战争。
Rather than indulge in the "praise" of the media and the public, he was more introspective: What problems do colleagues have in diagnosis, treatment and management in the pre-epidemic period? On the night of February 19, Zhao stressed that people, medical workers and health system workers should "respect the law of nature" and treat it with a scientific attitude.
赵智刚和同事们。
Zhao Zhigang and his colleagues.
确诊：为节省床位，回家隔离治疗2003年非典那年，赵智刚毕业，后在某部队医院感染科、急诊科、急诊重症监护室工作十余年。
Diagnosis: To save beds, home isolation treatment in 2003 SARS year, Zhao Zhigang graduated, after a military hospital infection department, emergency department, emergency intensive care unit for more than 10 years.
2019年，他转业来到武汉大学中南医院，任急救中心病房主任一职。
In 2019, he was transferred to Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital as a ward director of the Emergency Centre.
说起自己感染新冠病毒时的症状，赵智刚“轻描淡写”道：“有些咳嗽、发烧、乏力。
Speaking of his own symptoms when infected with the new crown virus, Zhao "understated": "Some cough, fever, fatigue.
”虽然他认为自身抵抗力还不错，但当时科室已有护士确诊，他还是检查了一下。
"Although he thought his resistance was good, he checked in after the department nurses confirmed it.
结果出乎他的意料，1月20日，他被确诊了。
On January 20th, to his surprise, he was diagnosed.
赵智刚说，他算是早期被确诊感染新冠病毒的医护人员之一。
Zhao said he was one of the first health care workers to be diagnosed with the new crown virus.
此前，赵智刚所在的科室被临时改造成接待发热病人的隔离病房。
Before that, Zhao Zhigang's department was temporarily transformed into an isolation ward for patients with fever.
他和全科室人员都忙活着发热病人的收治工作。
He and the entire department are busy with the treatment of febrile patients.
赵智刚每天负责20位病人，并参与30位病人的会诊，每天工作十五六个小时才能休息。
Zhao is responsible for 20 patients a day and participates in consultations with 30 patients, working 15-16 hours a day to rest.
在赵智刚看来，那时，正是抗疫的“慌乱”阶段。
In Zhao Zhigang's view, at that time, it was the "panic" phase of the epidemic.
来医院的发热病人越来越多，病房内的床位100%甚至120%收治病人，很多病人一床难求。
The number of feverish patients coming to the hospital is increasing, with 100% or even 120% of the beds available in the wards, many of whom have difficulty finding a bed.
看着满员的病房，为了不占用床位，确诊感染新冠病毒的赵智刚结合检查结果和临床表现判断自己属于轻症，随即拿了药回到宿舍隔离治疗。
Looking at the full ward, in order not to occupy beds, diagnosed with the new crown virus Zhao Zhigang combined with the results of the examination and clinical manifestations to determine that they belong to a mild disease, then took medicine back to dormitory isolation treatment.
从1月20日到2月5日，是赵智刚隔离进行自我治疗的日子。
From January 20 to February 5, Zhao Zhigang isolation for self-treatment.
如今，被问及确诊和隔离治疗时的病情变化和心理状态时，赵智刚避开不谈，语调轻松地称自己只是轻症，问题不大，“有信心能在家隔离自愈”。
Today, when asked about the changes and state of mind in the course of diagnosis and isolation, Zhao shunned the question, saying in a relaxed tone that he was just a mild case, that the problem was not serious and that he was "confident that he could heal in isolation at home."
那段时间，妻子沈杨每天都会电话追问他是否有气喘等症状，赵智刚都称没有。
At that time, his wife Shen Yang would ask him every day if he had asthma symptoms, Zhao Zhigang said no.
关于病情，他总不愿多说。
He was reluctant to say much about his illness.
这位40岁的中年男人不想在妻子和孩子们面前流露出担心和恐惧。
The 40-year-old man did not want to express fear and fear in front of his wife and children.
即便如此，药学专业出身的沈杨还是通过CT片子感知到丈夫身体的不适，“他的肺部炎症已经很明显了，不可能没有气喘胸闷等症状。
Even so, Shen Yang, a pharmaceutical professional, was aware of his husband's physical discomfort through CT scans. "His inflammation of the lungs is already evident, and it is impossible not to have asthma and other symptoms.
”治疗的半个月时间，丈夫的病情具体到了什么程度，沈杨无从得知。
Shen Yang did not know the exact extent of her husband's illness during half a month of treatment.
也是在赵智刚康复之后，他才告诉妻子，自我治疗的头几天，他不仅咳嗽，反复发烧，还有气喘胸闷等症状。
It was also after Zhao recovered that he told his wife that during the first few days of self-treatment, he not only coughed, had a fever and had asthma symptoms.
因对这个新疾病的认知少，也并不清楚自己病情会不会迅速恶化，每到夜深人静时，他常一个人黯然落泪。
With little knowledge of the new disease and little knowledge of its rapid deterioration, he would often weep alone in the dead of night.
厚厚的防护服下的赵智刚和同事。

返岗：这是场长期战，我必须顶上不幸中的万幸，赵智刚熬过头三天，烧终于退了，身体逐渐好转。
Back to work: This is a long battle, I must top the unfortunate lucky, Zhao Zhigang first three days, the fever finally retired, the body gradually improved.
从确诊到隔离自我治疗，半个多月后，他身体康复。
After more than half a month, from diagnosis to isolated self-treatment, he recovered.
妻子沈杨知道，丈夫是个闲不住的人。
His wife Shen Yang knew that her husband was a restless man.
即便生病期间，赵智刚也想着利用所学，多帮助市民。
Even during his illness, Zhao Zhigang wanted to use what he had learned to help people.
于是，他通过中南医院官方微信公众号的“在线咨询”入口，居家帮助有健康疑问的市民提供咨询服务。
As a result, he helped people with health problems at home through the "online consultation" portal of the official microphone number of the South China Hospital.
他每天坚持在线问诊10个小时以上，截至2月6日，共为743人次的患者提供在线问诊服务。
He was available online for more than 10 hours a day and, as at 6 February, had provided online consultations to 743 patients.
赵智刚的闲不住，还体现在他坚持申请返回一线。
Zhao Zhigang's restlessness is also reflected in his insistence on applying back to the front line.
赵智刚说，从对病人的临床观察来看，未达重症的新冠肺炎患者，治愈需半个月，重症的需一个月左右，危重症的需一个月以上，“这是场长期战，我必须顶上。
'From the clinical observation of patients, it takes half a month to cure people with severe coronary pneumonia, about a month for severe cases and more than a month for critical cases, "Zhao said.
”看着身边陆续有同事被感染，赵智刚也流露出感性的一面。
"Looking at the colleagues have been infected, Zhao Zhigang also reveals the emotional side.
他说，一方面，他回家治疗的这段时间，医院临时安排一位老医生顶上，赵智刚实在于心不忍。
On the one hand, he said, Zhao Zhigang suffered from the temporary placement of an old doctor at the hospital while he was going home for treatment.
另一方面，科室的医护人员都超负荷工作、辛苦的战斗着，“我不能拖了全组的后腿”。
On the other hand, the medical staff of the department are overworked and fighting hard. "I can't hold the whole team back."
赵智刚还说，前后与他一起返岗的，还有另外五名同事。
Zhao also said that he returned to work with him, along with five other colleagues.
同事们陆续染病，他很理解坚守抗疫的同事们心中的不安。
Colleagues continued to get sick, and he understood the unease of his colleagues who stood firm against the disease.
他们的“回归”对这些同事来说，是莫大的鼓舞。
Their "return" is a great encouragement to these colleagues.
护士郭琴是赵智刚所在科室里第一位确诊感染新冠肺炎的医护人员，她1月12日确诊，后住院治疗，康复后同样选择返岗继续工作。
Guoqin, a nurse who was the first medical worker in Zhao's department to be diagnosed with pneumonia, was admitted to hospital on January 12 and returned to work.
返岗后护理重症病人的她，工作比病前还要重些。
After returning home to care for the seriously ill, she worked harder than before the illness.
但她称，她染病后，其他同事都很害怕很焦虑，担心自己也染病，“现在我回来了，他们也能放心些。
But after she became ill, she said, her fellow workers were afraid and anxious and worried about getting sick themselves. "Now that I'm back, they can feel better.
”“之前，科室的微信群里传递的都是负能量。
"Previously, negative energy had been delivered in the micromail group of sections.
我们回来后，这些同事们脸上都能见着笑了。
When we got back, the colleagues could see a smile on their faces.
工作之余，互相开开玩笑，气氛也轻松了不少。
After work, joking with each other, the atmosphere has relaxed a lot.
”作为病房主任，赵智刚是“主心骨”。
As ward director, Zhao Zhigang is the "mainstay."
“感染了，大不了回家休息几天呗！”这虽是玩笑话，但更像是他们给自己心中打了一针强心剂。
"Infected, not big enough to go home to rest a few days!" This is a joke, but it is more like they give their hearts a shot in the heart.
赵智刚在安排工作。
Zhao Zhigang is arranging the work.
反思：疫情初期，应尊重疾病的自然规律赵智刚治愈后主动请缨返岗一事，经媒体报道后，引发公众点赞。
Reflection: In the early stage of the epidemic, Zhao Zhigang should respect the natural law of the disease after his recovery, after the media reported that the public praise.
在赵智刚看来，自己并非公众口中的“英雄”，只是做了医生该做的事。
In Zhao's view, he is not the "hero" of the public, just do what the doctor should do.
他没有沉溺于媒体和公众的“点赞”，他更多是反思：同事们多有感染，在疫情来临前期，他们在诊治和管理上到底出现了什么问题？回溯自己感染新冠肺炎的过程，赵智刚称或许是自己接诊病人时，没做好防护措施被传染，也或许是被同科室其他医护人员传染。
Rather than indulging in the media and public praise, he was more introspective: What was wrong with his colleagues' diagnosis, treatment and management in the early stages of the epidemic? Looking back at his new crown pneumonia, Zhao said he might have been infected when he was treating his patients, or by other medical staff in the same department.
1月初，赵智刚曾接到通知要求关注发热病人。
In early January, Zhao received a call to focus on febrile patients.
之后，科室陆续收治了很多发热病人。
Since then, departments have been receiving a number of fever patients.
那时，“新冠肺炎”暂被称为“不明原因肺炎”，医护人员乃至相关专家对这一新的疾病认知都不清晰。
At that time, the "new crown pneumonia" temporarily called "unknown causes of pneumonia," medical personnel and even relevant experts on this new disease awareness is unclear.
“接待病人时，我们只是做了一级防护，并没有把它当做新的、未知的、传染性非常强的疾病来对待。
"When we treat patients, we just do primary care and don't treat it as if it were a new, unknown, highly contagious disease.
”赵智刚反思，自己还是大意了，“我曾搞过肝病、肺结核，也曾一夜接诊过数十位禽流感患者，对待新冠肺炎本不该大意的。
"Zhao Zhigang reflected, their own negligence," I have had liver disease, tuberculosis, and a night of treatment of dozens of patients with avian flu, should not have been careless.
”基于此，赵智刚觉得，正是在疫情初期，各方面对这一疾病认识不到位，加之疏忽大意，导致科室医护人员被感染。
Based on this, Zhao felt that it was in the early stages of the epidemic that a lack of understanding of the disease, coupled with negligence, had led to the infection of medical staff in the department.
、在赵智刚看来，这种“疏忽大意”就是“未尊重自然规律和科学道理”。
In Zhao Zhigang's view, "negligence" means "not respecting the laws of nature and scientific reason.
他说，当出现这类未知疾病时，医护人员以及公共卫生系统工作人员就应该保持十分的警惕，做好防护和隔离，并以科学的态度来研究它、认知它，最终战胜它。
When such an unknown disease occurs, he says, health-care workers, as well as those working in the public health system, should remain vigilant, protect and isolate, and study it scientifically, recognize it, and eventually overcome it.
“要做到尊重自然规律，就要先尊重掌握规律和科学道理的人。
"Respect for the laws of nature requires first respect for those who have mastered the laws and scientific reasoning.
”赵智刚说，这次疫情是自然界给人类带来的全新挑战，市民、医护人员、卫生体系的工作人员以及其他各个方面，都应该从现在做起、从身边做起，尊重自然规律，应该有意识地培养下一代树立意识，以防以后再次发生类似疫情时，措手不及。
Zhao said the outbreak posed a new challenge to humanity and that the public, health-care workers, health-care workers and others should start now and respect the laws of nature. They should consciously cultivate the awareness of the next generation so that they will not be caught unawares if a similar outbreak occurs again.
赵智刚治疗病人。
Zhao Zhigang treats patients.
想家：常过家门而不入，女儿大哭要爸爸回家返岗后的赵智刚每隔几天，就拎着蔬菜水果，来到家门口，放下东西，给妻子沈杨发个信息，让她带着俩女儿出来拿，他站在十米开外的地方，远远的看一眼女儿们。
Every few days, Zhao Zhigang came to the door with vegetables and fruits. He put down his things and sent a message to his wife Shen Yang. He asked her and his two daughters to come out and take a look at his daughters ten meters away.
小宝才一岁多，大宝已经三岁多了，认得爸爸，冲过去索要一个“抱抱”，被沈杨拦住。
Xiaobao is just over a year old, Dabao has been more than three years old, know the father, rushed to ask for a "hug", Shen Yang stopped.
赵智刚叮嘱几句，告诉孩子们他把外面的病人都治好了就能回家。
Zhao Zhigang ordered a few words, told the children he had cured the outside patients can go home.
前后约一分钟，他就转身走了，因为科室有很多工作等着他处理。
About a minute before and after, he turned away, because he had a lot of work to do in the department.
赵智刚确诊之后就单独在宿舍住，妻子和母亲没过多久也发烧了，二宝也出现了类似症状。
Zhao Zhigang after the diagnosis of living alone in the dormitory, his wife and mother soon have a fever, Erbao also appeared similar symptoms.
当时医院每天的核酸检测试剂量少，家人不想占用名额，未做检测直接拿药在家隔离治疗。
At that time, the amount of nucleic acid testing reagent per day was small, family members do not want to occupy the quota, do not directly take drugs isolation treatment.
幸运的是，目前三人都已经康复。
Fortunately, all three have recovered so far.
确诊、自愈、返岗，至今，赵智刚已经一个多月没能抱抱两位“小公主”了。
Diagnosis, self-healing, back to work, so far, Zhao Zhigang has not been able to embrace two "small princess".
在妻子看来，丈夫平日里可谓是个“女儿奴”。
In his wife's eyes, the husband is usually a "daughter slave."
他很注重家庭欢乐的氛围，工作之外一有时间，就陪着孩子们，总是想法子让孩子们度过快乐的家庭时光。
He was very family-focused and accompanied the children whenever he had time away from work, always trying to get them to spend happy family time.
现在虽然见不到面，赵智刚也常常和女儿们视频聊天。
Although now do not see the face, Zhao Zhigang also often and daughters video chat.
21日中午，沈杨有点无奈的告诉澎湃新闻，大宝刚和丈夫视频通话，现在在大哭，一边哭一边说，“爸爸什么时候能回家”。
21 noon, Shen Yang a little helpless to tell the roar news, Dabao just and her husband video call, now crying, while saying, "Dad can go home when."
赵智刚也不知道什么时候能回家。
Zhao Zhigang also does not know when can go home.
疫情面前，他做好了长期“战斗”的准备。
In the face of the epidemic, he is ready for a long "battle."
常过家门而不入，赵智刚期待疫情早日结束，他要回家抱抱女儿和爱人。
Often out of the house, Zhao Zhigang looked forward to the end of the epidemic, he would go home to embrace his daughter and lover.
