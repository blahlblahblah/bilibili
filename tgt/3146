新冠肺炎疫情在美国持续蔓延之际，综合多家美媒8日爆料：美国总统特朗普2月29日曾被拍到与美国保守联盟(ACU)主席马特·施拉普(Matt Schlapp)握过手，而令人担忧的是，施拉普当地时间3月8日证实他曾与新冠肺炎感染者有过短暂接触。

While the White House insists that Trump has never had direct contact with infected people, and that there are no associated symptoms, the details of a political campaign highlight this risk.

It is worth noting, however, that there is no clear indication in US media reports that Schrapp came into contact with an infected person before or after shaking Trump's hand.
