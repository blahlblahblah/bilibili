尽管各地为房企“减负”的政策频出，但在新冠肺炎疫情影响下，房地产行业仍然被迫迎来了新一轮“洗牌”。
Despite frequent moves to "lighten the load" on the housing sector, the sector has been forced into a new wave of "shuffling" as a result of the new outbreak of pneumonia.
据人民法院公告网显示，2020年初至今，全国已有超过百家房企宣告破产，有时一天就会有好几家房企“消失”，大多为二三线城市里的中小型开发企业。
Since the beginning of 2020, more than 100 housing companies have gone bankrupt, and in some cases several have disappeared in a single day, mostly small and medium-sized developers in second- and third-tier cities, according to the People's Court's announcement website.
另一方面，“融资集中”趋势更为明显，资本市场更青睐评级高的大型房企或品牌房企，中小房企很难从新一轮的融资潮中分得一杯羹。
On the other hand, the trend towards "concentration of financing" is more pronounced, with capital markets favouring highly rated large or brand-name housing companies, with small and medium-sized firms struggling to take a slice of the new wave of financing.
一名外资银行从业人员也告诉《中国经营报》记者，房地产企业并不在此次降低利率的中小微企业名单中。
A foreign bank employee also told China Operator that real estate companies were not on the list of MSMEs that cut interest rates.
连日来，记者联系到20多名已破产或进入破产程序的企业负责人或管理人，其中有5人接受了采访。
Over the past few days, journalists have contacted more than 20 corporate executives or managers who have gone bankrupt or are in bankruptcy proceedings, five of whom have been interviewed.
亏损严重、投资不足、资金链断裂，是他们就企业破产提及频率最高的3个原因。
Serious losses, under-investment and broken financial chains are the top three reasons they mention corporate bankruptcy.
“大鱼吃小鱼，快鱼吃慢鱼，甚至是大鱼吃大鱼。
"Big fish eat small fish, fast fish eat slow fish, even big fish eat big fish.
”同策研究中心总监张宏伟认为，未来楼市将有新一轮的洗牌。
Zhang Hongwei, director of the Tongze Research Centre, thinks there will be a new round of shuffling in the housing market.
或迎新一轮洗牌“疫情之后，我们预判今年全年的商品房销售额规模、销售面积可能会下降7～8个百分点。
Or to face a new round of shuffle "epidemic, we anticipate this year's annual commercial housing sales scale, sales area may drop 7 to 8 percentage points.
”中指院杭州分院副院长高院生告诉记者，销售大规模回落带来的损失，可能更多的还是落在中小企业头上。
The vice-president of the Hangzhou branch of the middle school, Gao Yuan, told reporters that losses from the massive drop in sales might still fall on small and medium-sized enterprises.
宁国市长福置业有限公司（以下简称“长福置业”）位于宁国市港口镇五磁村，目前已经进入破产程序。
The mayor of Ningguo Fukuo Holdings Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Changfu Home") is located in Ningguo port town five magnets village, has now entered bankruptcy proceedings.
据天眼查信息显示，长福置业的经营范围为房地产开发、销售，注册资本仅为2000万元，是一家典型的地方小型房企。
According to the sky-eye survey information, Changfu home business scope for real estate development, sales, registered capital of only 20 million yuan, is a typical local small-scale housing enterprises.
突如其来的疫情令长福置业原定于3月13日召开的第一次债权人会议推迟至4月24日。
The sudden outbreak postponed the first meeting of creditors scheduled for March 13 to April 24.
“我们做的是一个政府回迁房项目，只有一部分是自己开发的，而且是中途加入的。
"We're doing a government rehousing project, and only part of it was self-developed and half-way through.
”长福置业相关负责人告诉记者，这个项目在开发区还比较特殊，他们刚进驻时，工地里什么也没有。
"The project is still special in the development zone, and when they first arrived, there was nothing on the site," he told reporters.
“政府当初允诺几年内能达到的招商规模，与实际情况相差甚大，时间又拖了太久，公司资金、项目完成度等各方面都不是很好，结果肯定是亏损的。
"The scale of investment that the government promised to achieve in a few years is very different from the actual situation, and it is taking too long.
”上述负责人进一步向记者解释亏损原因。
The person in charge further explained the loss to reporters.
同样进入破产重整程序的还有日照市润泰房地产开发有限公司（以下简称“润泰地产”）。
Also entering bankruptcy reorganization proceedings are Rizhao Runtai Real Estate Development Co. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Runtai real estate").
天眼查信息显示，润泰地产成立于2010年7月，主要经营范围为房地产、商品房、沿街房、住宅楼的开发、租赁、销售等，注册资本也不过3000万元。
In July 2010, Runtai Properties was founded in July, with a registered capital of just 30 million yuan for the development, leasing and sale of real estate, commercial housing, street houses, residential buildings, etc.
润泰地产管理人在接受记者采访时表示，公司濒临破产最主要的原因还是资金链断裂，但目前还在处理过程中，结果尚不可知。
Runtai real estate managers in an interview with reporters, said the company is near bankruptcy is the main reason for the break-up of the financial chain, but is still in the process of processing, the results are not known.
另一家进入破产程序的房企管理人也表示，公司是因为投资不足、资金链断裂才导致现状。
Another homeowner in bankruptcy proceedings also said the company was suffering from underinvestment and broken financial chains.
2月28日，山东省济南市历城区人民法院公告称，于2019年9月24日、10月11日、10月22日相继受理宝世达国际控股集团有限公司、济南宝世达实业发展有限公司等5家相关公司的重整申请。
On February 28, 2007, the People's Court of Liancheng District of Jinan City, Shandong Province, announced that it would accept the reorganization applications of 5 related companies on September 24, October 11 and October 22, 2019.
3月2日，宝世达集团相关负责人在接受记者采访时表示：“公司正在进行重组，地产板块被放弃了，现在已经没有人了。
"The company is being restructured, the real estate sector has been abandoned and there is no one left," Baoshida Group said in an interview with reporters on March 2
”中原地产市场分析师卢文曦认为，此次行业洗牌将会较为彻底，区域性中小房企的很多份额可能就没有了。
Lu Wenxi, a real estate analyst in Zhongyuan, said the reshuffle would be more thorough and that many shares of regional small and medium-sized housing enterprises might not be there.
“想进入房地产市场很难，但是被吃掉很容易。
"It's hard to get into the real estate market, but it's easy to eat.
”融资困境据华泰证券数据，2月，在短融中票的带动下，境内发债规模363亿元，同比上升50%，终结同比“5连降”；而境外债，相较1月的高峰开始回落，但1～2月累计发行1523亿元，同比提高3%，已占去年总发行量的28%。
According to Huatai Securities, domestic debt issuance hit 36.3 billion yuan in February, up 50 per cent year on year, up 50 per cent from the previous year, while cross-border debt started to fall from its January peak, but rose 3 per cent year-on-year to $152.3 billion in January-February, up 28 per cent on the previous year.
与此同时，“融资集中”趋势进一步强化。
At the same time, the trend of "financing concentration" intensified.
华泰证券研报分析称，高评级地产债明显更受资金追捧，发行占比跃升。
Huatai Securities Research analysis said that high-rated real estate debt is clearly more sought after by funds, the share of issues jumped.
1～2月，AAA地产债发行420亿元，占境内地产债发行规模的64%，去年全年为45%；AA+地产债发行152亿元，占比23%，去年为34%；AA地产债发行85亿元，占比12%，去年为21%。
In January and February, AAA real estate bonds issued 42 billion yuan, accounting for 64% of domestic real estate bond issuance, compared with 45% for the whole of last year. AA + real estate issued 15.2 billion yuan, or 23%, compared with 34% last year.
相较之下，中小企业融资空间被大大压缩。
In contrast, SME financing space has been significantly reduced.
锦艺集团就是其中的代表。
Jin Yi Group is one of them.
财报显示，截至去年6月，锦艺集团借贷融资额度8.99亿元已全部动用，还与5名独立第三方安排6笔共约4430港元的债券。
According to the results, as of June last year, the loan line of $899 million had been fully utilized and six bonds totalling about HK $4,430 were arranged with five independent third parties.
但从2019年下半年至今，集团还未有新的融资记录。
But since the second half of 2019, the group has had no new fund-raising record.
大唐地产资金层面也尤为紧张。
Dantang real estate capital level is also particularly tense.
公开数据显示，截至2019年6月，大唐地产未偿还的借款达到75.98亿元，一年内需偿还的借款为17.30亿元，1～2年未偿还借款为31.69亿元，但账面现金及现金等价物只有19.42亿元。
According to open data, as at June 2019, outstanding loans from Datang Estate amounted to $7,598 million, loans to be repaid in one year amounted to $1,730 million, loans outstanding for 1 to 2 years amounted to $3,169 million, while cash on hand and cash equivalents amounted to only $1,942 million.
浙系房企华鸿嘉信的情况也不容乐观。
Zhejiang department housing enterprise Hua Hung Jiaxin's situation also is not optimistic.
2016～2018年，华鸿嘉信的销售额分别为210亿元、349亿元、438亿元。
Between 2016 and 2018, Huahong's sales totaled 21 billion yuan, 34.9 billion yuan and 43.8 billion yuan, respectively.
但2019年，公司实际销售额仅为460亿元，并未完成原定500亿元的销售目标。
But in 2019, the company's actual sales were only 46 billion yuan, short of its original sales target of 50 billion yuan.
相较此前快速扩张，公司的近况并不及预期。
Compared to the previous rapid expansion, the company's recent situation is not as expected.
据克而瑞数据，今年前两个月，公司仅完成销售额30.1亿元，排名第88位，相比2019年排名又有所下滑。
In the first two months of this year, the company finished at 88th place with only 3.01 billion yuan in sales, down from 2019, according to Kluwer.
去年底加入公司的总裁张立洲，这名被外界寄予厚望的“救火队长”也于3月确认离职。
Zhang Lizhou, the company's president, joined the company late last year and was confirmed to leave in March by the much-anticipated "fire brigade captain."
针对融资、现金流近况等问题，记者分别致电致函锦艺集团、大唐地产、华鸿嘉信等企业。
For financing, cash flow, such as the latest situation, the reporter sent letters to Jinyi Group, Dantang real estate, Hua Hung Ka-shing and other enterprises.
锦艺集团方面表示，公司各项业务和销售均在规划范围内，未有销售上的“巨大损失”，业绩如期实现。
Jin Yi Group said that the company's business and sales are within the scope of the plan, there was no "huge loss" in sales, performance on schedule.
公司一直以来在经营上非常重视现金流和资金的使用；大唐地产方面则表示，正处于上市静默期不方便进行回复；而截至发稿，华鸿嘉信方面并未予以回复。
The company has long attached great importance to cash flow and the use of funds; Datang Real Estate said it was in the quiet period of the market is not convenient to respond; as of the writing, Hua Hung Ka-shing did not respond.
“中小房企的融资情况肯定不如品牌房企那么好。
"The financing situation of small and medium-sized housing enterprises is certainly not as good as brand housing.
”张宏伟表示，虽然融资授信额度较少，融资成本相对较高，当下中小房企也应尽可能通过自己的渠道融资，包括寻求资本市场力量缓解资金需求。
Mr Zhang said that, although credit lines were smaller and the cost of financing relatively high, small and medium-sized companies should seek financing through their own channels wherever possible, including by seeking capital market forces to ease their funding needs.
例如，当代置业有绿色住宅、科技住宅的特色，2月份发了两次绿色美元债，每次2亿美元左右，性价比也较为不错。
Contemporary homeowners, for example, feature green homes and tech homes, and issued green dollar debt twice in February, about $200 million at a time, offering better value for money.
多元化“自救”早在此次疫情之前，房地产行业已经迎来一轮洗牌，头部效应越发凸显。
Diversified "self-help" long before the epidemic, the real estate industry has ushered in a round of shuffling, head effect more and more prominent.
克而瑞数据显示，2019年，TOP3、TOP10、TOP30的权益销售金额集中度已分别达到近9.5%、21.4%、35.7%。
In 2019, the concentration of TOP 3, TOP 10 and TOP 30 has reached nearly 9.5%, 21.4% and 35.7%, respectively, according to Kray.
“这个阶段，中小房企活下去才是最核心的问题。
"At this stage, the survival of small and medium-sized housing enterprises is the most central issue.
”高院生认为，首先，应暂时停止拿地及投资行为，要确保自己的现金流；其次，需要想尽办法通过不同方式获得一定的资金支持，比如政府税收减免以及谋求金融方面合作等；最后，迫不得已之际，企业可以通过卖项目、转让部分股权等方式进行自救。
First, they should stop taking land and investments and ensure their own cash flow. Second, they need to find ways to obtain financial support in various ways, such as government tax breaks and financial co-operation.
正如高院生所说，为了“活下去”，五矿地产频频出让项目或部分股权。
As the high court students said, in order to "live", Minmetals property frequently sold projects or a part of the equity.
3月2日晚间，五矿地产宣布，该公司拟出售深圳坪山项目49%股权予华润置地，代价为12.863亿元。
On the evening of March 2, Minmetals announced that it intended to sell 49 per cent of its stake in the Shenzhen Ping Shan project to China Resources Land at a cost of $1,286.3 million.
两天后，据上海联合产权交易所消息，五矿地产拟再度转让旗下五矿地产(沈阳)有限公司100%股权，预披露起止日为2020年3月4日～31日。
Two days later, according to the Shanghai Stock Exchange, Minmetals intends to re-transfer its 100 per cent stake in its Minmetals Real Estate (Shenyang) Limited with a pre-disclosure date of 4-31 March 2020.
更早前，五矿地产还出售另一合资公司49%的股权，重组60亿港元4年期银团贷款。
Minmetals also sold a 49 per cent stake in another joint venture and restructured its HK $6 billion four-year syndicated loan.
无独有偶，锦艺集团也于2月21日发布盈利警告，称截至2019年12月的6个月，收益约为8893.9万港元，同比下降2.67%，股东应占溢利约为935.2万港元，同比下降60.12%。
Similarly, Kam On February 21, the group issued a profit warning, saying that for the six months to December 2019, the profit was about HK $88.939 million, down 2.67% from the previous year. Shareholders should account for about HK $9.352 million in profit, down 60.12% from the previous year.
有关“锦艺裁员近80人”的传言也随着“盈利警告”的发布而散播开来。
Rumours of "some 80 layoffs at Kam Yi" have also spread with the release of "profit warnings."
对此，锦艺集团方面回复称，公司未有裁员举动。
In response, Jin Yi Group replied that the company has not made layoffs.
目前全集团六大板块共有2000多人，已根据政府和企业生产要求，投入到正常的工作生产中。
At present, there are more than 2,000 people in the six major sections of the Group, according to government and enterprise production requirements, into normal work production.
“我们地产板块年前有160多人，现在钉钉上还有150多人，这也是正常的人员流动。
"We have more than 160 people in the real estate sector, but now there are more than 150 nails, which is normal mobility.
”值得注意的是，昔日集团龙头项目锦艺国际轻纺城，在这场行业淘汰赛中或成拖累。
It is worth noting that the former group leader Jinyi International Light Spindle City may have been a drag in the knockout stages of the industry.
2019年7月，锦艺集团便公告称，向独立第三方郑州丰祥投资出售佳聪物业全部股权，以2.12亿元人民币现金结算。
In July 2019, KAM announced that it would invest in an independent third party, Zhengzhou Fengxiang, to sell all its stake in the company for Rmb212 million in cash.
该售出资产为锦艺国际轻纺城或其一部分。
The assets sold are for Jinyi International Light Spindle City or part thereof.
据悉，欲打造成中国中部首席轻纺展贸综合体的锦艺轻纺城，曾计划投资50亿元，同时规划建设酒店、公寓等配套服务体系。
It is reported that the center of China to create the chief textile complex Jinyi light spinning city, has planned to invest 5 billion yuan, and the construction of hotels, apartments and other ancillary services system.
彼时，锦艺集团副总裁、锦艺轻纺城董事长陈锦庆表示，锦艺轻纺城项目正在打造的是从原材料供应、设计研发、智能制造、商贸展示、仓储物流到电子商务、产业金融、科技文化的全业态产业链发展模式，计划实现“千亿产业集群”。
At that time, Jin Jin-ching, vice-president of Kam Yip Group and Chairman of Jinyi Light Spindle City, said the Jinyi Light Spindle project was creating a "100-billion-dollar industrial chain development model of raw material supply, design development, intelligent manufacturing, trade show, warehousing logistics to e-commerce, industrial finance, science and technology culture.
但锦艺国际轻纺城近年来亏损严重。
But Jinyi International Light Spindle City has suffered serious losses in recent years.
据《大河报》报道，锦艺轻纺城相关负责人表示，从近几年锦艺轻纺城的运营来看，每年亏损金额2000万元左右。
In recent years, the company has reported a loss of about 20 million yuan a year due to the operation of Jinyi Light Spindle City, the newspaper reported.
商铺的入驻率最高的时候是60%，如今降到40%。
The occupancy rate for shops, which was 60 per cent at its peak, has fallen to 40 per cent.
锦艺集团相关负责人在接受记者采访时表示，锦艺国际轻纺城作为公司早期规模型项目，带动了集团纺织、地产、商业等众多业务的发展。
In an interview with reporters, the director of Jinyi International Light Spindle City, the company's early planning project, led to the development of textile, real estate, commercial and other business.
“该项目是集团产业部门负责的，确实出售了部分物业，未来将重新打造成汽配城。
"This project is the responsibility of the industrial division of the Group, did sell part of the property, the future will be rebuilt into a car city.
”起家于纺织业的锦艺集团，多元化发展也一直是其标签。
Diversification has also been a label for the brocade, which began in the textile industry.
公开资料显示，锦艺集团包括地产、商业、新材料、纺织、金融、互联网等六大产业板块，并涉足教育、康养等产业。
According to the public, Kam Yi Group comprises six major industries, namely real estate, business, new materials, textiles, finance and the Internet, and is involved in education, health and other industries.
去年6月，集团开始涉足工业大麻，一期工程目标年产量约为2000公斤。
Last June, the group began to dabble in industrial marijuana, with a target annual production of about 2,000 kilograms for the first phase.
“这是企业想通过多元化业务来对冲单一业务、周期变化对于企业报表业绩的影响。
"This is the impact of business diversification to hedge a single business cycle change on corporate reporting performance."
”在张宏伟看来，如果单纯做住宅开发，当遇到类似此次疫情楼市出现波动时，中小房企受到的影响会非常大；另一方面，产业与地产结合也是企业跟政府拿地购地的一个手段，能够降低拿地成本。
In Mr Zhang's view, small and medium-sized housing companies would be hit hard by fluctuations in the housing market, if only for residential purposes. On the other hand, the combination of property and property is a way for companies to buy land from the government, reducing the cost of acquiring land.
