据央视新闻，3日，就有关新冠肺炎疫情是否会导致今夏东京奥运会取消这一问题，日本奥运大臣桥本圣子公开表示，“协议要求奥运会在2020年内举行，这可以解释为允许推迟到年底举行。
"The agreement, which calls for the Olympics to be held in 2020, could be interpreted as allowing the games to be postponed until the end of the year," said Yasuo Hashimoto, Japan's Olympic minister, on Wednesday about whether the outbreak of pneumonia would lead to the cancellation of the Summer Games in Tokyo.
”桥本圣子表示，根据相关协议，推迟或取消奥运会的权利归国际奥委会所有，日本政府和东京都正在尽全力让奥运会如期举行，即7月24日开幕。
Mr Hashimoto said the right to postpone or cancel the games rested with the IOC, and the government and Tokyo were doing their utmost to keep the games on schedule, which opened on July 24.
图片来源：央视新闻据日本放送协会（NHK）报道，截至当地时间2日晚20时，日本北海道、神奈川县、爱媛县等地新增15例新冠肺炎确诊病例，累计确诊达976例。
Source: CCTV News reported that as of 20: 00 p.m. local time, 15 new cases of confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia had been confirmed in Hokkaido, Kanagawa Prefecture and Ehime Prefecture, with a total of 976 confirmed cases, CCTV News reported.
确诊病例包括在日本国内的感染者和中国游客等257人，“钻石公主号”邮轮上乘客和乘务人员705人，以及日本政府包机回日14人。
The confirmed cases include 257 from Japan and China, 705 from the Princess Diamond cruise ship, and 14 from the Japanese government on chartered flights.
此外，累计死亡病例12例。
In addition, there were 12 cumulative deaths.
据海外网此前报道，日本首相安倍晋三在2月26日参加国会答辩时表示，“将全力确保东京奥运会的召开”。
Shinzo Abe, Japan's prime minister, said in a parliamentary defence on Feb. 26 that "every effort will be made to ensure the Games are held in Tokyo," according to overseas reports.
“5月底可能成为作出最终决定的时限”据参考消息3日消息，桥本圣子说，双方合同仅限定在2020年内举行奥运会，并未具体规定日期。
"The end of May could be the time limit for reaching a final decision," Hashimoto said Wednesday, with no date specified, limiting the contract to 2020.
根据合同，东京最晚可延期至今年年底前举行奥运会。
According to the contract, Tokyo can postpone the Olympics until the end of this year at the latest.
但她强调，日本政府和东京仍力争原定7月24日开幕的计划。
But she stressed that the Japanese government and Tokyo were still fighting for the plan, which was set to open on July 24.
她表示，关于何时判断东京奥运会能否按时举办，目前尚无正式定论。
She said there was no formal agreement on when the Tokyo Olympics would be held on time.
但根据她的判断，5月底可能成为作出最终决定的时限。
However, in her judgement, the end of May could be the time frame for reaching a final decision.
她在发言中表示，根据最新测算，日本为东京奥运会投入的预算为1.35万亿日元（约合872亿人民币）。
In her speech, she said the latest estimate put Japan's budget for the Tokyo Olympics at Y1.35 trillion (87.2 billion yuan).
根据奥运会的主办协议，取消奥运会的权利属于国际奥委会。
According to the Olympic hosting agreement, the right to cancel the Games belongs to the IOC.
国际奥委会主席巴赫在上周曾表示，尽管冠状病毒蔓延，但国际奥委会将“全力”确保东京奥运会如期举行。
IOC President Bach said last week that despite the spread of the coronavirus, the IOC will "do its utmost" to ensure that the Tokyo Olympics are held as scheduled.
曾讨论过禁止观众入场的方案3月3日，据《每日邮报》报道，英国自行车运动协会主席斯蒂芬·帕克（Stephen Park）透露，国际奥委会、世界卫生组织和各大体育协会高层曾讨论过，在禁止观众入场的情况下举办东京奥运会的方案。
Stephen Park, chairman of the British Cycling Association, said on March 3 that the IOC, the World Health Organization and top sports associations had discussed a plan to hold the Tokyo Olympics without allowing spectators to enter.
全球疫情在奥运前夕得不到有效控制，相较于取消赛事或易地办赛，闭门举办奥运会或许是另一个可行的方案。
The global epidemic cannot be brought under effective control on the eve of the Olympics, and closed doors may be another viable alternative to cancelling events or changing venues.
而且在所有应急备案中，空场比赛是代价相对较小的选择。
And, of all the emergency records, playing empty is a relatively inexpensive option.
若奥运会选择空场进行，摄影团队可被允许入场进行电视转播，满足已经签署的高额转播合同。
If the Olympic Games choose an empty venue, the photography team can be allowed to enter the television broadcast, to meet the signed high-level broadcast contract.
除了亏损门票销售收入以外，日本当局及国际奥委会的各方面损失能降到最低。
Apart from the loss of ticket sales, the Japanese authorities and the IOC can minimize losses in all areas.
虽然空场比赛能够减少损失，但其弊端在于，运动员参赛本身也是一种聚集行为，无法完全规避感染风险。
Although an empty competition can reduce losses, its disadvantage is that the participation of athletes is itself a kind of aggregation, can not completely avoid the risk of infection.
尤其对于选手来源较为复杂的国际性赛事来说，这一形式仍有冒险性。
This form is still adventurous, especially for international tournaments where players come from more complex sources.
目前，日本国内的J联赛已经延期，而相扑比赛则是空场举行，这还是1945年以来的首次，此外，日本职业棒球联赛也是空场进行。
For the first time since 1945, Japan's domestic J-League has been postponed, and sumo matches have been held empty, and Japan's professional baseball leagues are empty.
国际奥委会发言人表示，“在做出任何明确决定前，奥运会组织者正在与世界卫生组织及日本一起监测局势的变化。
"Organizers of the Games are working with the World Health Organization and Japan to monitor the situation before making any definitive decision," an IOC spokesman said.
”安倍曾回应：将全力确保东京奥运会召开据海外网援引外媒报道，2月26日，安倍参加了日本众议院预算委员会的集中审议。
Abe has responded by making every effort to ensure that the Tokyo Olympic Games are held in accordance with foreign media reports quoted on overseas websites, and on February 26, Abe attended the intensive deliberations of Japan's House Budget Committee.
在回答日本国民民主党代表玉木雄一郎的问题时，安倍表示“作为政府，希望能在安心、安全的情况下，竭尽全力举办（这一赛事）”。
In response to a question by Ichiro Tamaki, the representative of Japan's National Democratic Party, Abe said: "As the government, I hope we can do everything we can to hold [the event] in peace and security."
安倍还强调，“作为政府，我们将继续在IOC（国际奥委会）、大会组委会、东京都之间进行紧密的合作，为使运动员和观众获得安心、安全的大会，切实做好举办的准备”。
"As the government, we will continue to work closely with the IOC, the organizing committee of the General Assembly and Tokyo, to prepare athletes and spectators for a safe and secure assembly," Abe stressed.
据了解，近日，国际奥委会委员迪克·庞德曾指出“如果三个月之后新冠肺炎疫情威胁不能消除，2020年东京奥运会可能取消”，这一言论也随即引爆国际舆论，成为各国关注焦点。
"If the threat of a new crown pneumonia is not eliminated in three months' time, then the 2020 Tokyo Olympics could be cancelled," IOC member Dick Pound said recently, sparking international concern.
国际奥委会方面也在随后做出回应，称国际奥委会正为东京奥运会如期成功举办而不断努力，除此之外，一切言论均属猜测。
The IOC responded later, saying all the comments were speculative except that the IOC was working hard to keep the Games on schedule.
针对庞德的言论，日本内阁官房长官菅义伟也在26日称，庞德的观点只代表其个人，不代表国际奥委会。
In response to Pound's remarks, Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Naoto Kan said on the 26th, Pang De's views on behalf of his own, not the IOC.
东京奥运会将按计划如期举行。
The Tokyo Olympic Games will be held as planned.
按照此前计划，东京奥运会将于今年7月24日至8月9日举行。
According to previous plans, the Games will be held from July 24 to August 9 this year.
奥运火炬传递将从3月26日在日本福岛县第一核电站中转场所“J-village”正式开始，历时121天巡回日本47个都道府县，并在7月24日的开幕式上点燃东京新国立竞技场的火炬台。
The Olympic torch relay will begin March 26 at the J-vilage, a staging area at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, toured Japan's 47 prefectures over 121 days and lit the cauldron of Tokyo's new Arena at the opening ceremony on July 24.
