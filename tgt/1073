医用物资频频告急，奋战在抗击新冠肺炎疫情一线的医务人员，他们在经历怎样的生活？他们中，有人被确诊感染后写下了遗书，有人在床边崩溃大哭，有人被家属奉劝不要去一线……当医护人员被感染变成患者时，他们会和普通武汉市民一样恐惧、脆弱、不知明天将如何到来；但当怀抱着“救死扶伤”这个神圣的使命时，又总是重拾希望。
What are the lives of the medical staff fighting the front lines of the New Crown Pneumonia? Some of them have written posthumous notes after being diagnosed with infection, others have broken down beside the bed and some have been advised by their families to stay away from the frontlines...
━━━━━恐惧39岁的刘丽萍是武汉市某二甲医院的主治医生。
Fear Liping Liu Liping, 39, is the attending physician at a hospital in Wuhan.
2020年1月21日，她和丈夫孩子回老家宜昌看望长辈。
On 21 January 2020, she and her husband and children returned to Yichang, their home town, to visit their elders.
第二天，她收到通知说即日起医护人员不得离开武汉。
The next day, she received notification that medical personnel must not leave Wuhan.
当天她赶回武汉并开始发烧。
She returned to Wuhan the same day and began to have a fever.
她知道自己大概率是被新型冠状病毒感染了。
She knew she had a good chance of being infected with the new coronavirus.
1月23日，武汉宣布封城。
On January 23, Wuhan declared the city closed.
这天，刘丽萍开始写遗书。
On this day, Liu Liping began to write suicide.
此时她的孩子开始有发烧症状，因此在遗书的开头她先向家人表达了愧疚之情。
At this point her child began to have fever symptoms, so at the beginning of the testament she first expressed her guilt to her family.
接着，她说，妈妈虽然不能陪着你长大，但妈妈会一直爱你。
Then, she said, although mother can not accompany you grow up, but mother will always love you.
而后，她到医院排队做CT检查，双肺呈毛玻璃状病灶。
She then queued for a CT scan at the hospital and her lungs were glassy.
没有核酸检测名额，她独自在家居家隔离。
No number of nucleic acid tests. She's alone at home.
此时，她的医生身份让位于了一个普通武汉市民的身份：恐惧、脆弱、不知明天将如何到来。
At this point, her status as a doctor gave way to that of an ordinary Wuhan citizen: fear, frailty, uncertainty about how tomorrow would come.
恐惧也是罗琴得知自己被感染后的第一反应。
Fear was also Roehin's first reaction when he learned that he was infected.
“脑子已经木掉了，那一瞬间自己有点不能接受。
"The brain had gone, and for a moment I could not accept it.
”罗琴是和刘丽萍同家医院的医师，2003年起就在目前的科室工作。
Roehin, a doctor at the same hospital as Liping, has worked in her current department since 2003.
1月21日下午5点，CT显示她的双肺呈现斑片造影。
At 5: 00 p.m. on January 21, CT revealed that her lungs were patched.
1月23日，核酸检测为阳性，她被确诊。
On 23 January, the nucleic acid test was positive and she was diagnosed.
她很忐忑。
She was perturbed.
17号收治重症病人后，她很警惕地让丈夫、孩子搬到了公婆家，不过那几天，她和同事同吃同住，没有任何隔离措施。
She moved her husband and children to her parents-in-law's house, but on those days she shared a home with her co-workers without any segregation.
之后密切接触的同事陆续做了CT检查，均没有异常。
Close contacts after the colleagues have done CT examination, no abnormalities.
由于病毒有潜伏期，此时其实依然无法判定同事们的安全，但罗琴说：“现在大家都在一线上，没办法下来。
Because of the latency of the virus, it is still not possible to determine the safety of colleagues, but Rochen said: "Now we are on the line, there is no way down.
”对于该医院的很多医护人员而言，参与这次疫情防控是一次临危受命。
For many of the hospital's health-care workers, getting involved in the epidemic was a task at hand.
1月21日，该医院被武汉市卫健委定为发热患者定点诊疗医院之一，并接受武汉一家三甲医院定点支援。
On January 21, the hospital was designated as one of the fever patients designated by Wuhan Health Commission, and received fixed-point support from a Wuhan Sanjia Hospital.
该院59岁的门诊护士方丽娟回忆说当时发热门诊每天都有一千多个病人，她为他们分诊、测量体温、送到医生办公室。
Fang Lijuan, a 59-year-old out-patient nurse at the hospital, recalled that the fever clinic had more than a thousand patients a day and that she treated them, took temperature and took them to the doctor's office.
走完这个流程得二十多分钟，而她当时只有医用外科口罩，没有护目镜。
It took her more than 20 minutes to complete the procedure, when she had only a medical surgical mask and no goggles.
1月30日，方丽娟被确诊感染新型冠状病毒，目前她正与同院另一名感染护士住在同一病房接受治疗。
On January 30, Fang Lijuan was diagnosed with the new coronavirus and is now in the same ward with another infection nurse.

受访者供图━━━━━感染居家隔离的一周，刘丽萍根据自己的医学知识给自己吃药。
Photograph by Interviewee -- --- A week of home isolation, Liu Liping took medicine for herself according to her medical knowledge.
孩子烧退了，丈夫又开始发烧。
The child burned out and the husband began to have a fever again.
刘丽萍本是个积极乐观的人，可那段时间她精神接近崩溃。
Liping was a positive and optimistic person, but she was on the verge of collapse during that time.
她天天失眠，不开电视、不看手机，每天睁着眼睛看天花板，甚至打过心理求助热线寻求帮助。
She has sleepless nights, doesn't turn on the TV, doesn't look at her cell phone, looks at the ceiling with her eyes open every day, and even calls the helpline for help.
1月30日，服用完阿奇霉素和奥司他韦两种药后，她感觉脑袋一崩，之后就失去了意识。
On January 30, after taking both azithromycin and oseltamivir, she felt her head collapse and lost consciousness.
不知过了多久她才醒过来，全身无力地在地板上躺了一个多小时后，她向院方发出了求救信号。
After some time she woke up, lay limp on the floor for more than an hour, and sent a distress signal to the hospital.
她被带到医院，两次核酸检测都为阳性后，她被确诊。
She was taken to the hospital, where she was diagnosed after she tested positive for both nucleic acids.
此时床位已相当紧张，必须等有人出院才有空缺。
The bed was already rather tight and had to wait until someone was discharged from the hospital.
刘丽萍是在给病人做检查时被感染的。
Liping was infected during the examination of her patient.
当时医院收了几个直接住进ICU的重症患者，为了解病人情况，刘丽萍须到病人床边做检查。
At that time, the hospital received several patients directly into ICU serious patients, in order to understand the patient's situation, Liu Liping to the bedside for an examination.
虽然当时官方宣称新型冠状病毒不会人传人，但一线的医生早就发现了问题。
Although officials said the new coronavirus could not be passed from person to person, first-line doctors had long since discovered the problem.
刘丽萍有做防护的意识，但她没有设备。
Liping has a sense of protection, but she has no equipment.
“去的时候我心里就有数了，但没有办法，病人来了你不能不管。
"I'll know when I go, but there's nothing I can do about it. You can't let the sick man come.
”因病人体重较大不易操作，她近距离接触了病人的身体。
Because the patient was too heavy to operate, she came into close contact with the patient.
“你在这个岗位上，你不去谁去啊？”几乎所有接受采访的被感染医护人员都知道他们是与病毒正面交锋的人。
"You're in this position, who are you not going to?" Almost all the infected health care workers interviewed knew that they were people who were directly confronted with the virus.
门诊护士方丽娟说四个给发热病人测体温的护士有两个被感染，而在用压舌板为病人检查咽喉情况时，病人呼出来的气体会直接喷在护士的脸上。
Outpatient nurse Fang Lijuan said two of the four nurses who took the fever test were infected, and the patient's exhaled gas was sprayed directly on the nurse's face while the tongue pressure plate was used to examine the patient's throat.
这种可见的危险让罗琴的丈夫徐树很担心。
The perceived danger worried Roehin's husband, Xu Shu.
徐树是武汉某高校老师，有不少高中同学在华中科技大学同济医学院附属同济医院（以下简称同济医院）和华中科技大学同济医学院附属协和医院（以下简称协和医院）工作。
Xu Shu is a university teacher in Wuhan. Many high school students work in Tongji Hospital (Tongji Hospital) attached to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Tongji Medical College Affiliated Concorde Hospital (hereinafter referred to as Concorde Hospital).
根据同学们反馈的一线情况，他一度想让体质较差的妻子打退堂鼓。
According to the feedback from his classmates, he once wanted to make poor wife retreat.
“哪怕不要这份工作了也无所谓。
"It doesn't matter if you don't want the job.
”他说。
'he said.
但随着疫情发展，他意识到这是当时武汉所有医院和所有医护人员都必须要面临的危险时，他没有再劝妻子。
But as the outbreak unfolded, he realized that it was a danger that all the hospitals and all the medical staff in Wuhan had to face.
妻子被感染时，徐树正好在阅读2003年非典型肺炎时期的报道。
Xu was reading about SARS in 2003 when his wife became infected.
他想到了最坏的结局。
He thought of the worst.
2003年时很多医护工作者被感染、被隔离，直到去世都没再与亲人相见。
In 2003, many health-care workers were infected and quarantined until they died without seeing their relatives.
徐树决定暂时不告诉罗琴的父母。
Xu decided not to tell Rochen's parents for the time being.
罗琴是1月17日被感染的。
Roehin was infected on January 17.
那天值班时，她接待了三个确诊病人。
On duty that day, she received three confirmed patients.
其中有一个呼吸衰竭，进来就被判定为病危，抽完血后罗琴和家属谈了话并参加了院里的会诊。
One of them, respiratory failure, came in and was judged to be in critical condition. After he had smoked, Roehin talked to his family and attended a consultation in the hospital.
她原本下午五点就应该下班，但那天直到九点多才忙完。
She was supposed to leave work at five in the afternoon, but she wasn't finished until after nine o'clock that day.
她很累，直接住在了医院。
She was very tired and lived directly in the hospital.
▲确诊那天，同事给罗琴送去的牛肉粉。
On the day of the diagnosis, my colleague gave Roehin beef powder.
受访者供图罗琴所在的科室，因为科室性质，医护人员的防护意识比其它科室稍强些，接诊时她穿了两层隔离衣、戴了N95口罩和帽子。
Because of the nature of the department, the protection consciousness of medical staff was slightly better than that of other departments. She was treated with two layers of protective clothing, a N95 mask and a hat.
她的疏漏发生在和家属谈话时。
Her omission occurred while talking to her family.
当时人们对病毒潜伏期的感染能力知之甚少。
Little was known about the virus's infectivity during latency.
1月19日，罗琴开始头疼、腹泻、食欲不振。
On January 19, Roehin began to suffer from headaches, diarrhoea and loss of appetite.
由于这不是新型冠状病毒肺炎感染者的典型症状，她没将自己的病症同肺炎联系起来。
She did not associate her illness with pneumonia because it was not a typical symptom of a person infected with the new coronavirus pneumonia.
19日她排夜班，下午她就在病房输液，晚上正常工作。
She works night shifts on the 19th, infusions in the hospital room in the afternoon, and works normally at night.
当天晚上她又收治了三个发热病人，其中一个后来转诊。
She treated three more febrile patients that evening, one of whom was later referred.
在医院工作十七年，她从没遇到这么忙的情况。
In seventeen years in the hospital, she had never been so busy.
21日下午，罗琴依然没有出现呼吸道问题，不过头疼加剧了。
On the afternoon of the 21st, Roehin still did not have respiratory problems, but his headache intensified.
科室里有四十年临床经验的老主任建议她做个CT，罗琴很犹豫。
The senior director of the department, who had 40 years of clinical experience, suggested a CT, and Rochen hesitated.
她体质较差，有轻微的重症肌无力。
She has a weak constitution and mild myasthenia gravis.
那段时间不明肺炎很多，虽然CT室在每个病人走后都会做一小时的消毒，但在没有完备的防护设备的情况下，医护人员并不愿意去。
There was a lot of unexplained pneumonia at the time, and although the CT room disinfected every patient for an hour after they left, health-care workers were reluctant to go without adequate protective equipment.
1月21日开始，她独自住院。
Beginning on 21 January, she was hospitalized alone.
1月25日她第一次复查CT，从一楼走到二楼时感到气促、心慌、胸闷。
On 25 January, she first reviewed CT and walked from the first floor to the second floor feeling short of breath, panic and chest tightness.
2月2日下午四点，两次核酸检验都是阴性后，罗琴出院回家。
At 4 p.m. on February 2, Roehin was discharged from the hospital after two negative nucleic acid tests.
保险起见，丈夫和孩子依然住在公婆家，她独自居住。
To be on the safe side, her husband and children still live with her in-laws, and she lives alone.
━━━━━康复“其它疾病你都知道怎么治，但这个真的太未知了。
Healing "You know how to cure all the other diseases, but this one is really too unknown.
”谈起拍完CT没做核酸测试、无法确诊因而无法住院的那一周时，刘丽萍说。
"Liu said of the week she was unable to be hospitalized after failing to take a CT scan that failed a nucleic acid test.
2月2日，罗琴出院的那天，刘丽萍获得了一张床位。
On February 2, the day she was discharged from hospital, Liping was given a bed.
回到熟悉的环境，她的安全感增强了不少。
Back in her familiar surroundings, her sense of security increased considerably.
经过一段时间的治疗，发烧、咳嗽、胸痛、腹泻这些症状都有所缓解，食欲也正在恢复。
After a period of treatment, fever, cough, chest pain, diarrhea these symptoms have been alleviated, appetite is also recovering.
另一个好消息是丈夫退烧了。
Another piece of good news is that my husband has a fever.
虽然目前他仍在家中自我隔离，但至少没有生命危险。
He is still isolated at home, but at least his life is not in danger.
重怀希望的刘丽萍删掉了绝望时留下的遗书。
Liu Liping, with a heavy sense of hope, deleted the testament she left in despair.
她现在比较担心的是科室另一位高烧不退的男同事。
She is now more worried about the department is another high-fever male colleagues.
他不久前才做了心脏支架手术，仍在恢复期，也因为重症病人做检查而被感染。
He recently had heart scaffold surgery and is still recovering from an infection caused by an examination of a critically ill patient.
她说现在医护人员被感染的情况很严重，因为超负荷工作，他们的免疫力也在下降。
Now, she says, health-care workers are badly infected because their immunity is declining because of overwork.
在医院，刘丽萍时常能见到一些生命的逝去。
In the hospital, Liu Liping can often see the death of some lives.
病人去世后，她得到床边为之做心电图以证明其死亡。
When the patient died, she was given an electrocardiogram (ECG) by her bed to prove her death.
世事无常是她很早就认清的事。
The impermanence of the world was something she had long recognized.
“能健康地活着太不容易了。
"It's not easy to live in health.
原来自己可能很看重的一些事，在生死面前都不算什么。
In fact, they may be very important to some things, in the face of life and death is nothing.
”刘丽萍2005年毕业于武汉大学医学院，次年开始在医院工作。
Liping graduated from Wuhan University Medical School in 2005 and began working in a hospital the following year.
谈及当初为何选择做医生时，她说：“医生能救死扶伤，是很神圣的事。
Talking about why she chose to be a doctor in the first place, she said, "It is a sacred thing for a doctor to save lives and injuries.
”这也是罗琴行医17年的理念。
This is the concept that Roehin practiced medicine for 17 years.
她说自己从不收红包、从不求感激，只因“这是我的职责，我只是在做我应该做的事”。
She says she never takes red envelopes and never asks for gratitude because "it's my job, I'm just doing what I'm supposed to do."
这几年医患关系紧张，她时常觉得伤心，但每次得到病人的信任时，她又觉得自己的工作很有意义。
These years have been stressful for doctors and patients, and she has often felt sad, but each time she has the trust of her patients, she has found her work meaningful.
出院后，罗琴一直在帮医院联系海外捐助物资，经常忙到深夜。
Since his discharge from hospital, Roehin has been helping the hospital with donations overseas, often until late at night.
从一线“病退”至二线后，罗琴一直在考虑如何帮助同事。
Roehin has been pondering how to help his colleagues since retiring from the first to the second.
她超负荷工作的同事曾因压力太大到她病床前大哭。
Her overworked co-worker used to cry in front of her bed because of the stress.
“现在有很多很多的病人，但医院的救治力量、医疗资源就这么多，他们住不进来，心里就真的特别难过。
"There are a lot of patients, but the hospital has so many medical treatment, resources, they can not live in, the heart is really particularly sad.
”罗琴哽咽着说她的很多同事都是24小时上班，“大家都想快一点，抢时间”。
"Many of her co-workers work around the clock," everyone wants to hurry and grab the time, "she sobbed.
▲一线医护人员。
Front-line medical staff.
受访者供图据罗琴了解，目前该医院的物资依然十分紧缺。
According to Roehin, the interviewee is aware that the hospital is still in short supply.
医护人员上午开始工作后，要一直等做完全部事情才出病区，因为中途一旦外出，防护服就须换掉、N95口罩就没用了。
When paramedics start working in the morning, they have to wait to do the whole thing before going out, because if you go out in the middle of the road, the suits will have to be changed, and the N95 mask will be useless.
由于缺乏口罩，现在很多医生都是不符合防护标准的口罩和外科医用口罩叠加使用。
Due to the lack of face masks, many doctors now use masks and surgical masks that do not meet protection standards.
在病床上时，罗琴就曾在校友群帮助协调物资，甚至请做生意的亲戚帮忙捐赠。
While in his hospital bed, Roehin helped coordinate supplies with his schoolmates and even asked his business relatives to help donate.
她曾联系到广西一家愿意将物资直接捐赠到一线的公司，对方在马来西亚买到一个货柜的N95口罩，结果马来西亚的卖方一听到是运到中国的就毁约了。
She had contacted a company in Guangxi that was willing to donate materials directly to the front line. The other party had bought a container of N95 masks in Malaysia. As a result, the Malaysian seller had broken the contract as soon as it heard that it had been shipped to China.
后来这家公司又重新寻找货源，捐赠了270件防护衣，第二批物资60箱防护衣也将上路。
The company then re-searched for supplies, donating 270 protective clothing, and a second consignment of 60 boxes of protective clothing will be on its way.
现在，罗琴最早期的头痛、腹泻症状早已消失，不过依然气短。
Today, Roehin's earliest headaches and diarrhea symptoms have long since disappeared, but they are still short of breath.
她咨询了呼吸科主任，对方说肺部还需时间修复，眼下能做的只有等待。
She consulted the respiratory director, who said the lungs would need time to repair and that all she could do was wait.
她担心自己是假阴性，打算过几天再做次检查——她已迫不及待重回岗位，而上前线的前提是她已确定痊愈、确定不会感染别人。
Fearing that she was false-negative, she plans to have another check-up in a few days - she can't wait to get back to work, but only if she's sure she's cured and sure she won't infect anyone else.
这一次，徐树决定支持她。
This time, Xu decided to support her.
他说妻子恢复后一定会去工作，他能做的就是帮她“稳定后方”。
He said his wife would go to work when she recovered. All he could do was help her "stabilize the rear."
比如照顾两岁多的孩子，比如说服希望女儿多休息的岳父岳母，比如贡献出自己的图书馆账号供妻子查阅与呼吸系统相关的医学知识。
Take care of two-year-olds, such as persuading parents-in-law who want their daughters to take more rest, such as giving up their library accounts for their wives' access to respiratory-system-related medical knowledge.
1月25日，字节跳动向中国红十字基金会捐赠2亿设立医务保障基金后不久，徐树加入了“帮医护人员做点什么”的行动中。
On January 25, Xu joined a campaign to "do something for health care workers" shortly after Byte Beat donated 200 million to the China Red Cross Foundation to set up a medical guarantee fund.
迄今为止，他已为医院十多位被感染的医护人员提交了资助申请。
So far, he has applied for grants for more than a dozen infected hospital staff.
他坦承：“之前都想打退堂鼓，但真到了这份上，我们都还有热血去做点事。
He admitted: "We all wanted to get out of the way before, but when it came to this, we all had something hot to do."
”（文中医务工作者均为“中国红十字基金会字节跳动医务工作者人道救助基金”受助人。
(The medical workers are all recipients of the Humanitarian Aid Fund for Chinese Red Cross Foundation Byte Beat Medical Workers.
应受访者要求，文中均为化名。

2020年1月25日，今日头条、抖音、西瓜视频母公司字节跳动向中国红十字基金会捐赠2亿元人民币，设立“中国红十字基金会字节跳动医务工作者人道救助基金”，为抗击疫情一线医务工作者提供保障。
On January 25, 2020, the parent company of today's headlines, chatter and watermelon video beater donated Rmb200m to the China Red Cross Foundation, setting up the "Humanitarian Relief Fund for Chinese Red Cross Foundation Byte Beat Medical Workers" to protect front-line medical workers against the epidemic.
截至2月12日，全国已经有209位疫情防控一线医务工作者获得资助。
As at 12 February, 209 frontline health-care workers across the country had received funding.
其中204位因抗击疫情而不幸感染的一线医务人员，每人获资助10万元；5位因抗击疫情而不幸殉职的一线医务人员，每个家庭获资助100万元。
Of these, 204 frontline medical staff were provided with $100,000 each, while 5 frontline medical staff who lost their lives in the fight against the outbreak received $1 million per family.
