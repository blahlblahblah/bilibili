作者 | 孔明明 赵磊 闫丽娇 魏佳 金玙璠编辑 | 周昶帆根据世界卫生组织（WHO）的定义，“全球大流行病”是一种“在世界范围内，广泛地人传人的新疾病”。
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the "global pandemic" is a "new disease from person to person throughout the world."
北京时间3月12日凌晨，世界卫生组织对新冠疫情定性，宣布2019冠状病毒疫情从“流行”升级为“全球大流行”。
In the early morning hours of March 12, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a new outbreak of coronavirus 2019 from "epidemic" to "global pandemic."
世界卫生组织总干事谭德塞表示，在过去两周，中国境外的2019冠状病毒感染病例增加了13倍，受影响国家数量增加了2倍。
In the past two weeks, there has been a 13-fold increase in 2019 coronavirus infections outside China and a threefold increase in the number of affected countries, according to WHO Director-General Lindsay Tham.
目前，疫情正在114个国家和地区中出现，而在未来几周内，预期确诊病例数、死亡人数和受影响国家数量都将进一步攀升。
The epidemic is currently occurring in 114 countries and territories, and the number of confirmed cases, deaths and countries affected is expected to rise further in the coming weeks.
恐慌正在蔓延至世界的每个角落。
Panic is spreading to every corner of the world.
在全球大流行病之下，散布在世界各地的华人有何遭遇，如何应对？他们所在国家具体情况又有何不同？燃财经对话7个疫情严重国家的华人，从他们眼中我们看到，世界各地从最开始的不重视到“严防死守”、从最开始的不在意防护到买不到口罩、从最开始的漫不经心到囤积物资甚至买枪、从最开始的心存侥幸到仓惶出逃……每个国家的文化和制度不同，每个国家都做出了自己的防护选择，这是一场需要全世界一起面对的大型灾难。
In the face of the global pandemic, what has happened to the Chinese people scattered around the world, and how do they deal with it? What are the differences in their countries? From the very beginning, the Chinese in the seven worst-hit countries, from careless handling to stockpiling and even buying guns from the beginning to fleeing.
“还是要理性看待灾难这件事情，因为历史上也有类似的事情出现过。
"It's time to look at the disaster rationally, because there have been similar events in history.
我们还是要冷静、客观和乐观，同时也要做好面对长期困难的准备。
We should remain calm, objective and optimistic, and at the same time be prepared for long-term difficulties.
”有受访对象说道。
"said one respondent.
万人马拉松可能会带来疫情爆发许多人在买枪应对灾难孙邻家 创业者 36岁 美国洛杉矶我在美国洛杉矶工作，暂时没有回国打算。
Many people are buying guns to cope with the disaster Suns Neighbors Entrepreneurs 36-year-old Los Angeles I am working in Los Angeles and have no plans to return home for the time being.
现在我会随时关注加州的疫情信息，很多朋友也会在朋友圈转发。
Now I'm keeping an eye on the situation in California, and a lot of friends will forward it to me.
国内情况比较严重时，我就认为这次疫情会影响到全球，这只是时间问题。
When the situation at home is serious, I think it is only a matter of time before the outbreak will affect the whole world.
常识告诉我们，这种新兴的传染性病毒在疫苗没有出来之前发展到全球的概率很高。
Common sense tells us that there is a high probability that this emerging infectious virus will spread globally before a vaccine is available.
并且现在跟2003年非典相比，全球化程度也不一样了。
And now, in contrast to SARS in 2003, globalization is not the same.
我一直没感觉到美国在国家政策上对这件事有多重视，有也是最近两周才开始。
I haven't felt how much the U. S. has focused on national policy, and some have only begun in the last two weeks.
大概上周加州州长说开始免费检测，算是公共政策上的信号。
Perhaps last week the governor of California signaled public policy when he said free testing would begin.
学校会发消毒洗手液等，其他都是宣传防范性措施，比如勤洗手、别去人多的地方等。
The school will issue disinfectant hand sanitizer, other is to promote preventive measures, such as frequent hand washing, do not go to many places, etc.
3月12日我也收到了住处的物业通知。
On March 12, I also received a property notice for my residence.
我认为现在公共政策和措施远远不够。
I believe that public policies and measures are far from adequate.
但美国和中国国情不同，中国人可能习惯在宏观调控政策出来后上下统一行动，而美国政府如果发布措施要求民众必须戴口罩，肯定会有很多人站出来说不行，这侵犯了人身自由，所以有些措施他们确实没有办法执行，只能倡导。
But because the US and China are different, and the Chinese may be used to acting together after macro-control policies come out, and if the US government issues measures requiring people to wear masks, there will surely be a lot of people coming forward and saying no, which is a violation of personal freedom.
现在很多物资开始紧缺，路上戴口罩的人也越来越多，这周跟上周比还是有变化。
Things are starting to run out and more people are wearing masks on the road, a change from last week.
最近我每天会收到电话或微信，询问我这边情况怎么样，让我注意安全。
Recently I have been receiving phone calls or letters every day asking me how things are on my side and asking me to be careful.
父母从上周开始，要求我每天在微信群里打卡、两天一视频，还要我多储备粮食在家，一个月不许出门，出门要戴口罩等。
My parents started asking me to punch in my micromail every day for two days. I was asked to store more food at home, not to go out for a month, to wear a mask.
3月14日和一周前的货架对比洛杉矶Walmart超市 来源 / 受访者经济层面，我认为主要影响体现在消费方面，比如说大家会少出现在商场、餐厅、景区这些地方，很多人也减少开会和旅行。
On the other hand, I think the main impact will be in terms of consumption. For example, people will be less likely to be in shopping malls, restaurants, scenic spots, and a lot of people will be less likely to meet and travel.
有朋友说下载了很多送菜的App，用的频次比之前高很多。
Some friends say they downloaded a lot of App dishes, much more frequently than before.
听朋友说，两周前很多人为了自卫开始去买枪。
Listening to friends, a lot of people started buying guns in self-defense two weeks ago.
因为美国历史上发生重大灾难时，可能会有暴徒冲进民众家里抢劫。
Because when there is a major disaster in American history, rioters can break into homes and loot people.
他们很多人其实不太相信政府或者警察在发生那种事情时能够保护民众。
Many of them don't really believe that the government or the police can protect the people when that happens.
民众去购买枪支来源/受访者上周日，全球20多个国家、全美50多个州、超过10万的人在洛杉矶跑了马拉松比赛，我认为这件事情很可能会引起病毒大面积传播。
More than 100,000 people in more than 20 countries, more than 50 states and more than 100,000 people ran marathons in Los Angeles on Sunday, and I think it could well cause a pandemic.
从上周日开始，我已经在家里储备粮食，完全不出门，准备等两周之后看看具体情况再酌情考虑。
Since Sunday, I've been stocking up at home, staying out of the house completely, ready to wait two weeks to see what's going on.
3月14日洛杉矶Target超市但我个人认为还是要理性看待灾难这件事情，因为历史上也有类似的事情出现。
14 March at the Target Supermarket in Los Angeles but I personally think we should take a rational look at the disaster because there have been similar events in history.
我们还是要冷静、客观和乐观，同时也要做好面对长期困难的准备。
We should remain calm, objective and optimistic, and at the same time be prepared for long-term difficulties.
直到“举国封城”大家才真正重视起来Dylan 留学生 22岁 意大利佛罗伦萨这两个月，我往返意大利和中国，像是经历了两次疫情。
It wasn't until the whole country was sealed that people really took notice. Two months after I arrived in Florence, Italy, at the age of 22, I traveled to Italy and China as if I had experienced two epidemics.
1月10日，我从佛罗伦萨回到山东老家，刚过了几天好日子，疫情就爆发了。
On January 10, I returned to my hometown of Shandong from Florence, just days after the outbreak of the epidemic.
整个春节，国内形势严峻，当时，我想着意大利安全一些，所以2月5日就飞了回去。
During the Spring Festival, when the situation in China was grim, I wanted Italy to be safer, so I flew back on February 5.
刚下飞机摘掉口罩，畅快呼吸的感觉真好，但没想到，等我居家隔离14天以后，意大利也爆发了，我又陷入了另一个疫区。
Just got off the plane to take off the mask, breathed good feeling, but I did not expect, after 14 days of isolation, Italy also broke out, I fell into another epidemic area.
和中国的严防死守不同，这里的人们一切如常。
Unlike the Chinese, who are so fiercely guarded, people here go about their business as usual.
咖啡馆、酒吧、餐厅、娱乐场所正常营业，大家晨跑、遛狗、聚会，该干嘛干嘛。
Cafes, bars, restaurants and entertainment establishments are open normally, and everyone does what he or she should do in the morning run, walk the dog or have a party.
我们学校已经有一例确诊病例，也没停课。
There has been a confirmed case in our school and the class has not been suspended.
如果不看新闻，完全感觉不到病毒正在急速蔓延。
Without watching the news, there is no sense that the virus is spreading rapidly.
我一周只出两次门，去超市采购生活用品。
I only go out twice a week to the supermarket for supplies.
说实话，戴口罩外出需要勇气。
To be honest, wearing a mask takes courage.
我去的超市对面是一家酒吧，有一次，一群正在聚会的人盯着我和我女朋友，觉得我们是异类。
Opposite the supermarket I went to was a bar. Once, a group of people at a party stared at me and my girlfriend and thought we were different.
还有一位老太太说：“如果你没有不舒服，不需要戴口罩”。
Another old lady said: "If you are not uncomfortable, do not need to wear a mask."
我也感觉不到他们的害怕。
I don't feel their fear, either.
意大利同学说，这就是一场“重感冒”，去世的都是老人。
This is a "bad cold," said the Italian classmate, who died of old people.
周围的人越不在乎，我就越担心，因为大家不重视，疫情就很难控制。
The more people around me don't care, the more I worry, because people do not pay attention to the epidemic is very difficult to control.
而且医疗资源有限，一旦感染，我们不是本国公民，是否能得到及时救治也是问题。
And with limited medical resources, once infected, we are not citizens, and access to timely treatment is also an issue.
本来我想囤好物资不出门熬过去，但3月7日，意大利一天新增了1200多病例，而疫情第二严重的艾米利亚大区，当天还有人在街头打篮球、晒太阳。
But on March 7, more than 1,200 new cases were recorded in Italy, the second most affected region in the region of Emilia, where people were playing basketball and basking in the sun.
我只想说两个字：绝了。
I just want to say two words: absolutely.
我当即决定回国，通过旅行社订了第二天的机票。
I immediately decided to return home and booked the next day's flight through the travel agency.
当时机票已经开始涨价，平时2800元就能买到的票，我花了4600元，从迪拜转机，飞了17个小时。
At that time, the price of air tickets has begun to rise, ordinary 2800 yuan can buy tickets, I spent 4,600 yuan, from Dubai transit, flying 17 hours.
一路上，我始终没有摘下口罩，连水都没敢喝一口。
All the way, I never took off my mask and dared not take a sip of water.
我刚走，米兰等地开始封锁。
I just left, Milan and the rest of the blockade.
3月10日，意大利累计确诊病例破万。
On 10 March, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in Italy reached 10,000.
我觉得这是一个转折点，从那天开始，意大利“举国封城”，大家才真正重视起来。
I think this is a turning point, from that day on, Italy "the whole country closed the city," we really pay attention to.
3月12日，佛罗伦萨一家超市门口排队的人封城令一宣布，回国机票立即涨价，经济舱秒光，上万元一张的票还要靠抢。
Fiorentina on March 12, a supermarket in front of the order announced that the price of a return ticket immediately increased, economy-class seconds light, tens of thousands of yuan of tickets will have to rely on looting.
我们有一个“疫情回国小分队”的微信群，明显可以感觉到大家的情绪越来越急躁，最近几天大家问得最多的一句话是“今天能飞吗？”我一个同学买了22号从莫斯科转机回国的票，现在还不知道能不能飞。
We have a small group of "back to the epidemic" micro-group, obviously can feel people's mood more and more impatient, the most asked in recent days is "can fly today?" A classmate of mine bought 22 from Moscow transit home tickets, now do not know whether it can fly.
“疫情回国小分队”群聊截图从我同学发来的照片看，现在街上确实空了，还学习中国经验，开一辆车在街头四处喊话，号召大家不要出门。
According to the photos from my classmate, the street is really empty now, and learning from the Chinese experience, driving a car around shouting, calling everyone not to go out.
但是，意大利人一向自由惯了，不会那么“听话”，所以再怎么封锁，肯定也不会像中国一样严格，大家只需要填写一个类似通行证的自我声明随时携带，还是可以出门的。
But Italians, accustomed to freedom, are not so obedient, so no blockade is as strict as China's, and one has only to fill in a self-declaration like a laissez-passer to carry around or go out.
3月12日，佛罗伦萨一家邮局限流市民在街头填写表格现在我在老家宾馆里隔离，这半年的学业算是耽误了。
On March 12, a post office in Florence restricted citizens filled out forms in the streets. Now I am isolated in my hometown hotel.
老师会提供PPT和在线网课让我们自学，也会发邮件布置作业，但我很担心考试过不了。
Teachers will provide PPT and online classes for self-study and email assignments, but I'm worried that we won't pass the exam.
意大利的学校统一停课到4月3日，希望到了那个时候，所有人都能摘下口罩自由呼吸。
Schools in Italy are closed until April 3, when it is hoped that everyone will be able to take off their masks and breathe freely.
999人的活动仍在继续戴口罩的华人会被歧视Dirk 医药科技行业从业者 27岁 德国汉堡我本科硕士在德国读完，就留在当地工作了，从2011年来德到现在9年了。
999 Chinese still wearing masks are discriminated against Practitioners in Medicine and Technology 27-year-old Hamburg Germany I completed my undergraduate degree in Germany and stayed to work there, nine years since 2011.
现在德国情况非常不乐观，国家层面对疫情的敏感性不够，相关举措比较滞后。
The situation in Germany is far from encouraging, there is insufficient sensitivity to the epidemic at the national level, and initiatives are lagging behind.
在意大利疫情蔓延后，德国没有阻断和意大利的往来，没有吸取国内防疫的经验。
After the outbreak spread in Italy, Germany did not cut off communication with Italy, did not learn from the experience of domestic immunization.
在德国发现病例以后，狂欢节、聚会、游行、球赛等都在继续，几万人不停地去闹去造。
After the discovery of cases in Germany, carnivals, parties, parades, games, etc. continued, and tens of thousands of people went on to make them.
有些举措还有点无厘头。
Some measures are a bit pointless.
两三天前，各州先后宣布“禁止1000人以上的各类活动”。
Two or three days ago, states announced that "all kinds of activities involving more than 1,000 people are prohibited."
也就是说，999人的活动照常继续。
In other words, 999 people continued their activities as usual.
一些大学图书馆的限制是当日只可同时容纳350人。
Some university libraries have a limit of 350 places on a given day.
这些数字是怎么来的，我不清楚。
How these numbers got here, I don't know.
疫情开始扩散时，当局甚至通过媒体告知民众，抗击病毒靠勤洗手，戴口罩没用。
When the epidemic began to spread, the authorities even told the population through the media that it was useless to fight the virus by washing hands frequently and wearing masks.
我们对这个信息的判断是，市面上物资急缺，支撑不了所有民众戴口罩，当局只能这样安抚民心。
Our verdict on this message is that the authorities can only reassure the population that supplies are in short supply to support all the people wearing masks.
但其实早有信号，早在中国疫情爆发时，我在的留学生圈都在买防护用品，捐赠到国内去，欧洲国家显然没有做好应对病毒的准备。
But there were early signs, back in the outbreak of China, I was in the international community are buying protective supplies, donated to the domestic, European countries clearly not ready to deal with the virus.
当汉堡出现第一例时，店里的口罩、消毒用品一夜之间被抢购一空。
When Hamburg first appeared, its masks and disinfectant supplies were snapped up overnight.
不知道是华人买的，还是外国人买的。
I don't know whether they were bought by Chinese or foreigners.
同时，当局告诉民众，会有六七成德国人被感染。
Meanwhile, authorities told the public that 60-70 percent of Germans would be infected.
关于这个数字，当地医学院和医生给出的解释是：包括德国在内的欧洲国家都不能效仿中国大举措封城，他们要在国家经济和防疫病毒之间找到平衡点，那么既然不能在短时间内控制病毒，他们就想通过延缓病毒的传播来控制病情。
The explanation given by local medical schools and doctors was that European countries, including Germany, could not follow China's example, balancing the national economy with the fight against the virus, so if they could not control the virus in a short time, they wanted to control it by slowing it down.
虽然最终殃及60-70%的人，但是只要战线拉得足够长，比如说每天新增100-200例，医疗系统还有足够的床位、医生去应对。
Although 60-70 per cent of the population was eventually affected, the system still had enough beds and doctors to deal with it if it was stretched long enough, for example, to add 100 to 200 new cases a day.
显然，现实打破了他们的设想。
It is clear that reality has shattered their vision.
德国时间12日晚上的消息是单日新增确诊病例超过1000人，可以说迎来了爆发期。
German time on the night of 12 news that more than 1,000 new cases of a single day, can be said to usher in an outbreak.
但是现在汉堡街头依然熙熙攘攘，华人的自我保护意识都比较强，出门一定会戴口罩，德国人完全相反，没有一个人戴口罩，而且很淡定。
But now the streets of Hamburg are still bustling, the Chinese are more self-conscious, must wear masks outside, the German opposite, no one wearing masks, and very quiet.
最初他们是没有意识到严重性，现在即便意识到了，市面上的N95口罩已经从5欧涨到15欧，也根本买不到。
At first they weren't aware of the seriousness, but even now they realize that the market for N95 masks has risen from 5 to 15.
欧洲很多国家为了防范恐怖分子，设有“反蒙面法”，就是禁止在公共场合佩戴面纱，这项法律对德国一部分特别固执的人，特别是老年群体，有根深蒂固的影响。
Many countries in Europe have "anti-masked laws," which prohibit the wearing of the veil in public, which have deep-rooted effects on a particularly recalcitrant segment of the German population, particularly the elderly.
如果你在公共场合戴口罩，会被歧视，周围人会盯着你，他们不能理解你为什么要戴口罩。
If you wear a mask in public, you will be discriminated against and people will stare at you. They can't understand why you wear a mask.
汉堡学校宣布停课 来源 / 受访者供图最新消息是，汉堡的学校下周一开始停课。
Burger School Announced Suspension of Classes The latest development was that Hamburg schools were closed next Monday.
希望当局能出台更多有效的举措。
It is hoped that more effective measures will be put in place.
精英治国下的管理透明是防控疫情的灵丹妙药Tracy Yao 珠宝设计师 40岁 新加坡我每年有一半时间会在新加坡，先生常驻这边，孩子在国内上学。
Transparent management under meritocracy is a panacea for the epidemic Tracy Yao Jewelry Designer 40 years old Singapore I spend half my year in Singapore, where my husband is stationed, and my children go to school at home.
前段时间她放假，我们组织了一个游学团，1月16号她跟团来了新加坡，其他人大概是21号凌晨回去的，也就是那天，国内钟南山院士宣布了“人传人”。
Some time ago, she had a holiday, we organized a study tour, January 16, she came to Singapore with the group, the others probably 21 in the early morning, that is, that day, the domestic academician Zhong Nan Shan announced the "person-to-person.
我们当时觉得很幸运，之前还和合作伙伴商量这个团是年前还是年后来，如果年后的话损失会很惨重，因为国内会要求新加坡这边的旅行社把预付金退回去，但旅行社已经把预付金给到新加坡的酒店了，很多搞旅游的中小企业就不行了。
We were lucky enough to talk to our partners about whether the group was a year ago or a year later, and if so, the losses would be severe, as the travel agency on the Singapore side would be required to refund the advance, but the travel agency had already given the advance to hotels in Singapore, and many of the small and medium-sized tourism enterprises could not.
新加坡目前还好，昨天新增13例，累计也就200例，对于一个500多万人口的国家来说，在管控措施不是特别严厉的情况下，应该控制得不错。
Singapore is doing well, with 13 new cases and a cumulative total of 200 yesterday. For a country of more than five million people, controls should be kept under control if they are not particularly stringent.
我觉得最重要的原因是很早阻断了输入通道，政府的工作非常透明，给了民众很强的信心，一切都有条不紊。
I think the most important reason is the early blocking of the input channels, the transparency of the work of the government, the confidence given to the people, everything is in order.
新加坡 图 / 视觉中国总理2月初发表过一次讲话，前两天又公开讲话，号召民众做好自己的工作，不要慌乱，将宝贵的医疗资源让给重症患者。
The Prime Minister of Singapore Tu / Vision made a speech in early February, followed by another two days in public calling on the people to do their job well and not to panic and give up their precious medical resources to the seriously ill.
新加坡也不会采取封城等措施，但预计会加强措施，提前测试，让新加坡人做好准备。
Singapore will not adopt measures such as closures, but is expected to step up measures to test ahead of time to prepare Singaporeans.
虽然社会整体比较稳定，但新加坡是一个多元国家，之前发生过几起聚集性感染，有教堂集会、军人俱乐部等，政府能做的更多是倡议，小型集会并不严管。
Although the society as a whole is relatively stable, Singapore is a multi-ethnic country with a few previous cases of conglomerate infections, church meetings, military clubs, etc., where the Government can do more with initiatives than small gatherings.
此外，宗教的力量也不可小觑。
Moreover, the power of religion cannot be underestimated.
前几天还发生一件很奇葩的事情，一个政府部长聚集了200个民众举行了一场抗疫大会，非常奇怪的操作。
A few days ago a wonderful event happened, a government minister gathered 200 people to hold an anti-epidemic congress, very strange operation.
我觉得应对措施跟国情有很大关系。
I think coping strategies have a lot to do with national conditions.
新加坡一是精英治国，社会很理性，管理很透明，有一对武汉夫妇谎报行程在新加坡被控制，大家都会议论你诚信有问题。
Singapore is a meritocracy, a rational society, transparent management, a couple of Wuhan couples falsely reported that the trip was controlled in Singapore, everyone about your integrity.
一个PR（永久居民）被驱逐出境，原因是他拒绝居家隔离，电话不接，当局发出的禁令不回应，就取消了他的永居资格，这在新加坡都是不被容忍的。
One PR (permanent resident) was deported because he refused to be separated from his family, his telephone was not answered and his permanent residence status was revoked without a response from the authorities, which is not tolerated in Singapore.
第二就是新加坡的资源太匮乏，不能造成民众恐慌，自始至终新加坡政府都不建议民众戴口罩，说你生病了才需要戴，没生病就不建议戴，把口罩留给更需要的地方。
Second, Singapore is too resource-strapped to cause panic. Throughout, the government has not advised people to wear masks, saying you need them when you're sick, not when you're sick, and leave them where you need them more.
有一天新增了很多病例，超市大米被抢购一空，但第二天就上架了更多的大米，意思是让民众知道物资供应很充足，后来就再也没有哄抢的情况，只有口罩买不到。
One day there were many new cases, and supermarket rice was snapped up, but the next day more rice was on shelves, meaning people knew that supplies were plentiful, but there was no looting and only masks could not be bought.
加上领导人带头降薪，还有总理夫人她们也会在社交媒体上发声，所以民众非常相信政府，防疫举措都实施得比较到位，我觉得疫情在新加坡不会爆发。
With leaders taking the lead in wage cuts and the Prime Minister's wife having a voice on social media, people have a lot of faith in the government, immunization initiatives are in place and I don't think the epidemic will break out in Singapore.
不过经济还是会受到很大冲击，旅游业损失惨重，据说前段时间景点的游客下降90%，甚至有些景点为了吸引游客都是免费的，还有酒店客流也损失了三四成，航空业、零售业、航运业都会受到很大影响。
However, the economy will be hit hard, tourism is losing a lot of money, tourists are said to have fallen by 90% in the past few weeks, some attractions are free to attract tourists, and hotel traffic is down 30-40%.
韩国首尔还是正常上下班对影视行业冲击很严重王莹 韩国留学生 25岁 韩国首尔我的学校在韩国首尔。
Seoul, South Korea or normal commuting to film and television industry impact very serious Wang Ying South Korean students 25-year-old Seoul South Korea my school in Seoul.
国内疫情突然严重时，我害怕韩国禁止中国人入境，提前回了首尔，先自我隔离了两周，一直待在首尔家中。
When the outbreak suddenly became severe, I was afraid that South Korea would bar the Chinese from entering the country. I returned to Seoul early and secluded myself for two weeks and stayed at home in Seoul.
后来韩国疫情逐渐严重，学校也改成网络授课，我决定回国。
Later, the Korean epidemic gradually serious, the school also changed to network teaching, I decided to return home.
我最近刚刚回国，目前还在接受隔离。
I recently returned to the country and am still in isolation.
韩国目前确诊人数有8000人左右，每天按800多人的速度增长。
South Korea now has around 8,000 confirmed cases, growing by more than 800 people a day.
首尔还是正常上下班，公共区域有安排红外测温仪和消毒。
Seoul is still normal work, the public area with arrangements for infrared thermometers and disinfection.
但学校已经推迟开学，一些大型场所歇业休息，口罩也是“一罩难求”。
But schools have been delayed, some large sites are closed, and masks are "hard to come by."
物资供应、交通运输基本和平时一样，不过韩国的影视行业受到冲击比较大，因为他们是边拍边播，一些已经播出的剧很难因为疫情停止拍摄。
Supplies, transport and communications are basically the same as usual, but South Korea's film and television industry has been hit hard because they are filming, and some of the shows that have been aired are difficult to stop shooting because of the epidemic.
韩国是一个崇拜宗教自由的国家，疫情初期，人们还是会参加礼拜聚会（包括新天地等教会）。
South Korea is a country where religious freedom is worshipped. In the early days of the epidemic, people attended church gatherings (including churches like Xintiandi).
一开始有人也在质疑他们，我觉得是因为他们早期并不了解疫情的严重性。
Some people were questioning them at first, and I think it was because they didn't understand the severity of the outbreak at an early stage.
中国付出了惨痛代价才让人明白病毒的厉害程度，但我们不能因为看到疫情初期病毒具有传播的可能性，就否认宗教的一切。
China paid a heavy price to understand the extent of the virus, but we should not deny everything because we see the possibility of its spread in the early stages of the epidemic.
我了解到的事实是，首尔的教会已经全部取消礼拜，并一直宣传如何预防病毒，而且积极向教会周围的社区居民提供口罩，这都是教会的自发行为。
I have learned of the fact that churches in Seoul have cancelled all worship and have been advocating how to prevent the virus, and have been actively supplying masks to communities around the church, which is a spontaneous act of the church.
图 / 视觉中国每个国家的国情、制度、经济条件都不一样，很难互相效仿。
TOPIC / VISION China has different national conditions, systems and economic conditions, which make it difficult to imitate one another.
中国能够做到这么大的底气和有效地控制，不单单因为体制原因，还要归功于国内基础产业链的健全、物资的充沛，以及政府的强管控力。
China's ability to gain such strength and effective control is due not only to institutional reasons, but also to the soundness of the country's basic industrial chain, the abundance of goods, and the strength of government control.
韩国媒体对疫情是很直接和不乐观地报道，当地医生也直接宣布“最坏的情况韩国将会有40%的人被感染”。
The South Korean media reported the outbreak directly and unoptimistically, and local doctors directly declared that "in the worst-case scenario, 40 percent of South Koreans will be infected."
首尔现在已经100多例，大邱市更不乐观。
Seoul now has more than 100 cases, and Daegu is even less sanguine.
不过在首尔的朋友一直说首尔很安全，很多首尔人也认为首尔很安全。
But friends in Seoul have been saying Seoul is safe, and many in Seoul say Seoul is safe.
显然他们还没有完全意识到病毒的高传染性风险，也没有正确地认识到首尔的土地面积小，人口基数多，接下来可能会出现爆发式的增长。
Clearly, they are not fully aware of the high risk of infection, nor do they correctly recognize that Seoul has a small land area and a large population base, which could be followed by explosive growth.
韩国政府从发现到现在的管控，从来都没有隐瞒事实，都是直接向市民告知真相，并且告诫市民注意预防。
From discovery to the present, the Korean government has never hidden the truth, but has directly informed the public of the truth and warned the public against prevention.
不隐瞒，我觉得是韩国政府做得最好的一件事情。
No, I think it's the best thing the South Korean government has ever done.
疫情当下，能有所作为都是好的。
In an epidemic situation, it is good to be able to do something.
不作为才是最坏的，目前来看，韩国政府很努力了。
Inaction is the worst. For now, the South Korean government is working hard.
国内疫情刚刚爆发时 ，我内心很气愤，觉得这都是人类不敬畏生命导致的结果，随着疫情逐渐严重，我又将愤怒转移到社会，认为是社会缺乏信息透明和公开。
When the epidemic first erupted in China, I was outraged that it was the result of a lack of respect for human life. As the epidemic got worse, I shifted my anger to society, which perceived a lack of transparency and openness.
后来我觉得其实不应该这样想，那种情况下，可能谁都很难做出正确判断。
And then I thought I shouldn't have thought that way. In that case, it might be very difficult for anyone to make a correct judgment.
现在，我试图去理解。
Now, I'm trying to understand.
连续发烧4天才有资格申请检测日本疫情成了一个迷小宇 日本留学生 24岁 日本东京我们学校从2月18日开始放假，我原计划2月底回国，但当时考虑到国内的疫情较重，怕路上有感染风险就取消了，没想到现在日本要比国内更严重，再想回国也没那么容易了，东京这边只有成田机场还有直飞北京的航班，落地后还要在北京机场附近的酒店集中隔离，所以我现在也打消了回去的念头，不出门更安全些。
My school in Tokyo started school on Feb. 18 and I was planning to return home at the end of February, but considering the severity of the epidemic in Japan and the risk of infection on the road, it was not so easy to return home.
日本疫情就一个字：“迷”。
The Japanese epidemic is just one word: "Enigma."
感觉快要大爆发了，但看数据是在平稳增长。
It feels like it's about to explode, but the numbers are growing steadily.
现在公布的确诊病例是1388例，前天新增了54例，东京还好，北海道那边会严重些，但实际上病例可能更多，日本国内目前对疫情的态度很奇怪，觉得不检测就没有事，理由是怕造成本国的医疗崩坏，要把治疗机会留给重症患者。
There are now 1,388 confirmed cases, 54 new cases the day before yesterday, Tokyo is OK, Hokkaido will be more serious, but in fact there may be more cases, Japan's current attitude to the epidemic is strange, do not feel the case for fear of causing the collapse of medical treatment in their home country, to leave treatment opportunities to seriously ill patients.
软银总裁孙正义免费捐赠100万试剂盒在网上被骂了个半死，结果只能换成捐口罩。
Softbank president Sun Ji donated 1 million kits free of charge and was scolded half-dead online, only to exchange them for masks.
在东京，你需要连续4天发烧37.5度以上才有资格去医院申请检测，但人家也不一定给你检测，所以真要是被感染了，不是重症也得拖成重症。
In Tokyo, you need more than 37.5 degrees of fever for 4 days to qualify for a test, but people don't have to give you a test, so if you get an infection, it's not a serious illness but a serious one.
而轻症患者是建议在家隔离治疗，但也没有人强迫你，完全靠自觉，有些发烧的人还会去工作。
Patients with mild cases are advised to stay home-based, but no one is forcing you to be completely conscious, and some people with a fever will still be at work.
因此，目前日本的确诊数估计要小于实际感染数。
As a result, the current number of confirmed cases in Japan is estimated to be smaller than the actual number.
图 / 视觉中国不过日本民众最近也开始重视了，我住在东京池袋这边，每次去超市感觉有60%的人戴上了口罩，今天去涩谷那边，估计有80%以上戴了口罩，主要还是公主号邮轮的原因，日本国内局势严重了不少。
I live on the side of the Tokyo Pool Bag. Every time I go to the supermarket, 60% of the people wear masks. Today, more than 80% of the people in Shibuya are wearing masks.
我们本来放假后有学校老师开的个人课程和技能鉴定考试，这些都已经取消了，日本的学校也大多停课了，有些公司也允许员工申请在家工作。
We were supposed to have personal classes and skills tests from school teachers after the holiday, which have been canceled. Most schools in Japan are closed, and some companies allow employees to apply to work from home.
日本政府颁布了一些措施，比如禁止百人以上的聚集活动，旅游景点缩短营业时间，但没那么严格，像京都等地方也并不遵守。
The government has enacted measures such as banning gatherings of more than 100 people and shortening business hours at tourist attractions, but they are less strict and are not observed in places like Kyoto.
之前民众也都在网上骂政府，觉得公主号事件没处理好，但后来被政府一顿说服之后，开始了“韭菜的自我修养”，听从政府的建议，毕竟日本民众心里也没底，因为都不检测。
Before the people also scold the government on the Internet, the Princess did not deal with the incident, but then was convinced by the government, began "leek self-cultivation," listen to the government's advice, after all, the Japanese people do not have the bottom, because they do not test.
这次疫情对日本经济是重创，游客锐减，日本主要是第三产业，再加上全球供应链中断、消费需求下降，电子、汽车等传统制造业也遭到了打击。
The epidemic has hit the Japanese economy hard, tourists have fallen sharply, and Japan's tertiary sector, along with disruptions in global supply chains and falling consumer demand, has hit traditional manufacturing industries such as electronics and automobiles.
日本政府为什么那么执着于奥运会？本来是想赌一把国运，提振经济，没想到发生这么大的疫情。
Why is the Japanese government so persistent in the Olympic Games? Originally intended to bet a fortune, boost the economy, did not expect such a large outbreak.
虽然形势严峻，但日本人整体比较有素质，没有过度恐慌，除了抢空卫生纸之外没有出现过什么骚乱。
Though the situation is grim, the Japanese as a whole are more qualified and do not panic, except for the empty toilet paper there has been no disturbance.
他们真的怕发生医疗挤兑，但另一方面，我觉得检测了才能安心一点，不至于不知道自己是不是，然后到处乱跑成为移动感染源。
They were really afraid of a medical run, but on the other hand, I felt like I could be reassured that I didn't know if I was, and ran around as a source of mobile infections.
所以我比较不能理解这一点，也比较担心。
So I am less able to understand this point, but also more worried.
从上到下疫情都有波及旅游业已完全暂停孙洁 亚兹德波斯缘中餐厅创办人34岁伊朗亚兹德伊朗这边现在疫情从上到下都有波及，政府里很多人都感染了病毒，伊朗之前不重视，也不戴口罩，导致互相传染。
From top to bottom, the epidemic has affected the tourism industry.The founder of the 34-year-old Chinese restaurant on the Yazd Persia edge of Iran, 34, has now spread from top to bottom, with many in the government infected with the virus, Iran previously ignored it and did not wear masks, leading to mutual infection.
我是2019年4月份来的伊朗，原本打算在中国春节之后回国，但现在因为国内疫情没法回国。
I came to Iran in April 2019 and had intended to return home after the Chinese New Year, but I have not been able to do so because of an epidemic in China.
目前听说伊朗真实死亡人数比新闻报道的要多。
The real death toll in Iran is now heard to be higher than news reports suggest.
死亡人数越来越多，最近在社交软件新闻上，也看到医生说患病病人的情况很严重，十几天前去药店买口罩已经没有了，这时大家才慢慢意识到疫情的严重性，开始戴口罩。
More and more people are dying, and recently, on the social software news, they saw doctors saying the patient was in a serious condition. A few days ago, when the drug store no longer had a mask, people slowly realized the severity of the outbreak and started wearing masks.
学校也从10天前开始陆续关闭，除了一些卖生活必需品的超市其他商店都关门了，我在这里的民宿和中国餐厅也都关了。
Schools have been closed since 10 days ago, with the exception of some grocery stores, which are closed, as well as those in China.
3月11日政府发布了公告，从3月12日开始，三天时间不要出门。
On 11 March, the Government issued a public announcement, starting on 12 March, to stay inside the house for three days.
被关闭的餐厅和酒店 来源/ 受访者3月21日是伊朗新年，相当于中国的春节。
Shut Down Restaurants and Hotel Sources / Respondents March 21 is the Iranian New Year, equivalent to the Chinese New Year.
伊朗人喜欢在新年去别的地方旅游，听说去年这个时候民宿都订不到房间，政府专门开通了清真寺和学校来接待游客，但现在已经基本没有游客了，大家都没了生意。
Iranians like to travel elsewhere on New Year's Day. It is said that no rooms are booked at this time last year. The government has opened mosques and schools to receive tourists, but now there are few tourists and no business.
很多伊朗人觉得是中国人把病毒带过来的，有点仇视中国人。
Many Iranians feel that the Chinese brought the virus here, a bit hostile to the Chinese.
在德黑兰的留学生说，他们现在都不敢出门，因为怕当地人对他们构成威胁。
Foreign students in Tehran say they are now afraid to go out for fear the locals will threaten them.
我有次在路上碰到一个人朝着我喊“coronavirus”，去餐厅吃饭的时候，会看到有人在议论。
I once met a man on the road yelling "coronavirus" to me. When I went to the restaurant for dinner, I saw someone talking.
中国春节时这边疫情还没起来，很多游客买了口罩回去，政府也给中国捐了很多口罩，但这边生产力不够，医疗水平也不怎么行，现在中国有派专家过来，还会捐口罩和防护物资等，疫情可能会得到控制。
Many tourists have bought masks and the government donated many masks to China. But the productivity here is not enough and medical care is not very good. Now that China has experts coming and donating masks and protective materials, the epidemic may be under control.
商店都已经关闭的街道 来源/ 受访者伊朗人觉得戴口罩就代表你有病，而不是为了防护。
Shops Are Closed Street Sources / Interviewees Iranians feel that wearing a mask is a sign of illness, not protection.
伊朗人不爱洗手，政府新闻里面跟大家说出门必须戴口罩，最好戴手套，但很多人也不在乎。
Iranians don't wash their hands, and many people don't mind being told in government news that they must wear masks and gloves when going out.
这边的人因为有信仰，会觉得这个病没关系，他们的神会保佑他们。
This side of the people because of faith, will feel that the disease is okay, their gods will bless them.
我还在电视新闻上看到年纪大的一些人说，真主会保佑他们。
I also saw older people on the television news saying that Allah would bless them.
伊朗跟欧洲一样，见面会亲脸、握手，伊朗人还喜欢一起吃饭、一起喝茶，伊朗这边家庭人数也多。
Iran, like Europe, meets face to face, handshakes, Iranians like to eat and drink tea together, and Iran has a large family.
最近情况好一点，大家见面问候改成了两个拳头碰一下。
Things have been a little better recently, and everyone's greeting has been replaced by two fists.
现在去超市的时候，工作人员会拿消毒液给每个人的手上喷一下，再发一副一次性手套，这点做得蛮好，但我感觉政府还需要继续宣传疫情的严重性，让大家都知道这件事情。
Now when we go to the supermarket, the staff will give everyone a hand spray of disinfectant and a pair of disposable gloves, which is fine, but I feel the government needs to continue to publicize the severity of the epidemic and let everyone know about it.
