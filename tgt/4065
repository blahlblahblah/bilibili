如果没有政府的重视，小区严格的管理系统，社区工作者的不断攻坚，怎么能会在2个月内抑制如此可怕的新冠疫情。
Without the attention of the government, strict community management system, community workers will continue to attack, how can within two months to curb such a terrible new crown epidemic.
文 | 李 莹在经历了30多个小时从旧金山到上海的非常旅途之后，我3月10日晚抵达上海浦东国际机场，从机场检测完，我持小绿标出关的那时起，心中充满喜悦，终于回到了祖国，回到阿拉上海了。
After more than 30 hours of arduous journeys from San Francisco to Shanghai, I arrived at Shanghai's Pudong International Airport on the evening of March 10. After testing at the airport, my heart filled with joy when I checked it out.
办好手续进入小区，我开始自觉隔离。
After going through the formalities and entering the community, I began to isolate myself.
本计划在家闷一周的，没想到12日晚看新闻播报：上海市新冠肺炎防控工作领导小组办公室宣布，为进一步防控境外输入疫情风险，从3月13日零时起，所有中外人员，凡是在进入上海之日前14天内，有过韩国、意大利、伊朗、日本、法国、西班牙、德国、美国等国家旅行或居住史的，一律实施居家或集中隔离健康观察，也就是一律隔离14天。
The Office of the Leading Group for the Prevention and Control of New Crowne Pneumonia in Shanghai announced that from 0000 hours on March 13, all Chinese and foreign personnel who had traveled or resided in Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan, France, Spain, Germany and the United States during the 14 days before the date of entry into Shanghai will be placed under quarantine for 14 days.
第二天一大早居委会干部就来敲门了：“请签收居家隔离观察告知书。
Early the next morning neighborhood committee cadres came knocking on the door: "Please sign the home isolation observation notice.
每天会有问询电话打来，请一定接听。
There will be an enquiry call every day. Please be sure to answer.
”干部们还进行了更仔细的楼道消毒。
Cadres also carried out more careful aisle disinfection.
晚上新闻里说：上海有个新增广东籍病例，9日从美国纽约出发，经香港转机后于10日抵达上海虹桥机场。
A new case of Cantonese was reported in Shanghai, which arrived at Shanghai Hongqiao Airport 10 days after connecting flight between Hong Kong and New York, the evening news said.
哎呀，糟糕！这样说我可能还和这人在香港机场一个空间呆过，不知道他在哪个转机厅？哪个登机口上的飞机？好可怕！认真搜索了信息，原来他坐的是东航，我乘坐的是国泰航空，他抵达虹桥，我到浦东，似乎完美错过，但心里还是怕怕的。
Oh, no! I might have stayed in a space with this man at the Hong Kong airport. I don't know what connecting flight he is in. What a terrible plane! I searched the information carefully.
于是我开始一天三次量体温做记录，坚持吃大蒜精，而智能机器人也每日早晚都会拨通我的电话，问我体温有没有超过37.3度，有没有咳嗽、胸口闷、骨头酸痛的症状，要不要居委会的帮助等，不禁感叹：如果没有政府的重视，小区严格的管理系统，社区工作者的不断攻坚，怎么能会在2个月内抑制如此可怕的新冠疫情。
So I started taking temperature measurements three times a day and insisted on eating garlic essence, and the intelligent robot called me every morning and evening to ask if I had a temperature of more than 37.3 degrees, cough, chest tightness, sore bones, or help from a neighborhood committee.
Play隔离期间我和妈妈在两个卧室里各自生活，吃饭也是轮流到客厅，各自用公筷夹好菜，分开吃。
My mother and I lived in separate bedrooms during the day, and we took turns eating in the living room, using chopsticks to separate meals.
但是，电视剧里的一个喷嚏声，一次清嗓子，一个小动静都会听到妈妈说：“完了！”真是分分钟心惊肉跳，还好最后都会以量体温正常而平息。
But a sneeze in the TV play, a clear voice, a small movement will hear her mother said: "Finished!" Really minutes of panic-stricken, but will eventually be measured normal temperature and calm.
昨日就更搞笑了。
Yesterday was even more hilarious.
早上起来我实在无聊，便找出第九套广播体操的视频学做起来，精力那个旺盛啊，连做2遍不吃力，还有些微微冒汗的感觉，真是春天的脚步近了。
In the morning I was really bored, so I found out the ninth set of radio gymnastics video to do, energy that exuberant ah, even do not bother to do two times, but also a little sweaty feeling, it is really spring step.
可到了下午开始不对头了，手臂怎么有点隐隐酸呢，例行量体温怎么36.9度了！我原来都是36.7度的啊，怎么腿也感觉有点酸呢，不会中招了吧……吓得我脸瞬间红了，又量了一遍体温，还是36.9度。
But by the afternoon something was wrong, the arm was a little bit sour, the routine temperature is 36.9 degrees! I was 36.7 degrees ah, how the legs also feel a bit sour, will not admit...... scared my face red, again took a temperature, or 36.9 degrees.
这下妈妈急了，问我喉咙痛哇？要通知居委会哇？“慢着！先冷静一下，排除法：除了手臂酸其他地方并没有异样，也没有咳嗽、胸口闷，也没有腹泻，虽说体温上去了0.2但并没有超过37度呀。
Mom was so anxious to ask me about a sore throat? "Wait! Calm down and get rid of it first: there was nothing different except acid in the arm, no cough, chest tightness, and diarrhea, although the temperature was 0.2 degrees but not more than 37 degrees.
”今天天气倒是觉得蛮热的，一查23度，我还是高领羊毛衫+珊瑚绒家居服+羽绒服，是不是太热了焐的？手酸腿酸应该和早上跳操有关，毕竟快2个月没运动了。
It was hot today, but at 23 degrees I still had a high-collared cardigan + coral down domestic service + down-down jacket, was it too hot to warm it?
听我这样一分析，妈妈瘫坐在凳子上说：“吓死我了，血压肯定上去了，我得量量。
After listening to my analysis, my mother collapsed on the stool and said, "I'm scared to death. My blood pressure must have gone up.
”3分钟后结果出来了，高压164低压96。
Three minutes later the results came out, at high pressure of 164 low 96.
于是，我调整了着衣量，晚上7点又量了一下体温，36.7度，妈妈也量了血压，高压143低压83，“终于下来了”，她劫后余生般地说：“这隔离的日子真是分分钟能吓死人啊……”·专访｜坂本龙一：人类是稍微偏离自然轨道的、有点坏掉的猴子·不顾世卫组织纠正，“中国病毒”成特朗普口头禅，有阴谋！·火线｜帮新冠肺炎重病人“熬病程”——专访国家卫健委专家组成员管向东教授新民周刊所有平台稿件，未经正式授权一律不得转载、出版、改编或进行与新民周刊版权相关的其他行为，违者必究。
