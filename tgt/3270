他们去查了我手机信息，也看了我的健康证明，但无论我怎么解释，最后，他们还是说我需要去集中隔离点。
They checked my cell phone information and read my health certificate, but no matter how I explained it, they finally said I needed to concentrate on the quarantine.
口述 | 赵先生整理 |黄　祺我做好一切准备，3月5日从贵州老家出发，到广西复工复产，万万没想到，到广西后却被当做“重点疫情地区人员”。
Running away from my hometown in Guizhou and resuming business in Guangxi on March 5, I never expected to be seen as a "key epidemic area person" when I arrived in Guangxi.
此刻，我隔离在宾馆里，我问他们：我最近40多天没去过重点地区，为什么需要隔离？他们说：因为你的身份证是武汉的。
At this moment, I am isolated in the hotel, I asked them: I have not been to the key areas for more than 40 days, why need isolation? They said: Because your identity card is Wuhan.
公司的项目复工复产及投标等着我去推动，原本计划还要去海南、广东等地，可现在，我哪里也去不了。
The company's project to resume production and bidding waiting for me to promote, had planned to go to Hainan, Guangdong and other places, but now, I can not go anywhere.
我正在各方申诉，4天过去了，没有人告诉我为什么不让我出去。
I was complaining on all sides, four days later, and no one told me why I was not allowed out.
三人一同复工，就我一人被隔离我是一家环境科技公司的执行董事，我们公司总部在武汉，全国各地都有项目。
I am the executive director of an environmental technology company. Our company is headquartered in Wuhan and has projects all over the country.
平常我多数时间在武汉工作，上大学时户口随迁到了学校，十年前大学毕业时，我的户口落在了武汉工作的单位地，身份证也换成了武汉身份证。
When I graduated from university ten years ago, my account landed in the unit where I worked in Wuhan, and my identity card was changed to Wuhan identity card.
1月19日，春节放假，我从武汉回到贵州省麻江县农村老家过年。
January 19, the Spring Festival holiday, I returned from Wuhan to Guizhou Province, Ma Jiangxian rural home New Year.
回到老家，我从新闻里了解到武汉新冠肺炎疫情严重了。
Back home, I learned from the news that Wuhan New Crown Pneumonia serious epidemic.
谨慎起见，我一回到家就几乎没有出门。
To be on the safe side, I hardly went out as soon as I got home.
1月24日，政府工作人员到我家来，要求我居家隔离不要出门，我就一直没有出去。
On January 24, government workers came to my house and asked me to stay in isolation. I never went out.
整个春节，我都在关注疫情的发展。
Throughout the Spring Festival, I have been watching the development of the epidemic.
朋友圈里，我发的都是新冠疫情的新闻和动态。
In the circle of friends, all I send is the news and the new crown epidemic situation.
每天看着确诊病人数据，看到各地防控措施，看着全国医生去救援，心情起起伏伏。
Every day looking at confirmed patient data, see control measures around the country, watching doctors go to the rescue, the mood ups and downs.
一直到2月下旬，终于看到了曙光，武汉疫情慢慢有缓解的样子了，复工有盼头了。
Until the second half of February, finally saw the dawn, Wuhan epidemic slowly ease the appearance of the resumption of work there is hope.
2月下旬，媒体上的新闻开始报道各地如何做好复工复产，我们联系了广西这边的业务合作方，项目要启动了，合作方需要我们过去。
In late February, news in the media began to report on how to resume work in various places. We contacted the business partners on the Guangxi side.
我知道现在还是非常时期，所以尽量做好准备。
I know these are not normal times, so try to be prepared.
我有一个春节在重庆老家的同事，已经提前半个多月到了广西，我问他，广西当地对于外地进去的人有什么要求。
I have a Chinese New Year in Chongqing home colleagues, has more than half a month in advance to Guangxi, I asked him, Guangxi local people to go into what requirements.
同事说，只要不是从重点地区来的，没有什么特殊手续。
Colleagues said that there was no special procedure as long as they were not from key areas.
他从重庆到广西后，一切正常，可以工作。
After he went from Chongqing to Guangxi, everything was fine and he could work.
根据贵州老家这边的要求，3月2日，我去村委登记备案，然后到镇卫生院去检查身体，得到了《麻江县外出务工人员健康申请证明》，整个过程都是按照要求来的。
According to the request from this side of Guizhou Province, on March 2, I went to the village committee to register, and then went to the town health center to check my body.
证明上写得很清楚，最近一个月内，我有没有发烧，最近有没有去过疫情重点地区，有没有接触过患者等等。
The certificate clearly states that I have had a fever in the past month, that I have recently been to any of the key areas of the outbreak, that I have had no contact with patients, etc.
3月5日，我开车从家里出发，途经凯里南站接到两位同事，一个家在重庆，另一个家在长沙。
On March 5, I drove from my home and through the Kerinan station to receive two colleagues, one in Chongqing and the other in Changsha.
600多公里的路，我们开了7个多小时。
We drove more than seven hours on more than 600 kilometres.
一路上很顺利，公路上已经没有疫情防控卡点，我们一条路走到底，晚上九点多到达广西南宁市吴圩镇。
Along the way, there are no epidemic prevention and control card points on the highway. We go all the way to the bottom and arrive at Wuwei Town, Nanning City, Guangxi at 9pm.
休息一晚，第二天早上七点多出发，当晚九点多到广西上思县昌菱社区住下。
Rest one night, the next morning more than seven o'clock departure, that night more than 9 p.m. Changling community in Guangxi Shanxi County live.
我们公司的项目在广西上思县在妙镇，3月7日，我和同事到合作方公司考察情况，为复工复产相关事宜做安排。
Our project is located in Miaozhen, Shanxi County, Guangxi. On March 7, my colleagues and I visited our company to make arrangements for the resumption of work.
看起来一切顺利，我满脑子都是项目上的事情，广西的事情忙完，我还要赶着去处理推进其他项目复工事宜。
Everything seems to be going well. I've got my head full of work on the project. Guangxi is busy and I have to hurry to get the other projects back to work.
但是，一切在3月7日下午开始换了一条车道。
However, it all began to change lanes in the afternoon of 7 March.
那天下午，社区工作人员找到我和同事，叫我们一起到社区登记外来人员情况。
That afternoon, community workers approached me and my colleagues and asked us to go into the community to register outsiders.
后来我知道，是小区人员看到我的车牌是鄂牌，报告给了社区。
Later I knew that it was the neighborhood people who saw that my license plate was an E card and reported it to the community.
我觉得这样也是对的，我们很配合地去填写了相关表格文件，晚上派出所、当地政府部门多次电话沟通核实。
I think this is also right, we are very cooperative to fill out the relevant forms and documents, night police stations, local government departments, many telephone communication and verification.
让我们没有想到的是，我们如实报告了所有信息后，他们最后的结论是，要把我带去集中隔离点隔离，而我的同事不用去。
What did not occur to us was that, after we had faithfully reported all the information, they had come to the conclusion that they would take me to the central isolation point and isolate me while my colleagues did not.
我完全不能接受，问他们为什么我需要隔离，得到的回答是：我的身份证是湖北户籍。
I could not accept it at all. I asked them why I needed to be quarantined and was told that my ID card was Hubei household registration.
接下来一个多小时的时间，我不停地跟分管疫情的副镇长、派出所相关负责人、社区主任、隔离点负责人解释，我让他们看我的健康证明，让他们用我的手机号码查我之前一个多月的行踪，我跟他们说我是公司负责人，近期还要出差推进企业复工复产……他们去查了我手机信息，也看了我的健康证明，但无论我怎么解释，最后，他们还是说我需要去集中隔离点。
Over the next hour or so, I kept explaining to the deputy mayor in charge of the outbreak, the police station chief, the community director, the quarantine head, I showed them my health certificate, asked them to check my mobile phone number more than a month ago.
这个过程中我们没有起什么冲突，因为我是企业负责人，我觉得这个事情总是能说清楚的，不符合规定总不能强行隔离我。
We had no conflict in the process, because I was in charge of the business, and I felt that the matter could always be made clear.
我当时还录了音，我说，如果你们这个决定不符合规定，你们要承担责任。
I also recorded the recording, I said, if you do not comply with this decision, you have to take responsibility.
工作人员说，录音是可以的。
Staff said the recording was okay.
我跟着他们去了隔离宾馆，我想着到那边我再继续找相关部门，总能解决这个问题。
I followed them to the quarantined hotel, and I thought I would go over there and continue looking for the relevant department, which would always solve the problem.
没人能决定怎么让我出来通过项目合作单位的帮助，我打电话给管企业的当地工信局领导，打给糖业局领导（我们合作企业属于糖业行业），还打给文旅局领导，因为隔离点的管理归文旅局管。
No one could decide how to get me out with the help of the project partners. I called the head of the local ITB in charge of the company, the head of the Sugar Bureau (our cooperative was in the sugar industry), and the head of the Cultural and Tourism Bureau because the management of the quarantine site was under the control of the bureau.
我讲了我的情况，这些领导说，会把我的情况反映到当地新冠肺炎疫情防控指挥部，让我等回音，然后，就没有回音了。
I spoke about my situation, and the leaders said they would take my case to the local New Crown Pneumonia Command and let me wait for an answer, and then there was no answer.
我还去国务院网站上的疫情情况反映渠道留言，留过三次言。
I also went to the State Council website to reflect the epidemic situation of the channel message, left three statements.
我现在住在隔离点宾馆，哪里也去不了，唯一能做的就是继续打听到底谁能管管我这个事情：仅仅因为我的武汉身份证，我就被隔离了。
I now live in a secluded hotel and can't go anywhere. The only thing I can do is to find out who can take care of me: I'm isolated just because of my Wuhan identity card.
我这几天继续在找各种人沟通，但所有人给我的回答都是：没有人能决定解除我的隔离。
I continued to talk to all sorts of people these days, but all of them gave me the answer: no one could decide to lift my isolation.
现在我处于一种尴尬的境地，我在广西官方推出的“广西健康码”上获得了健康码，显示为绿色，绿色的意思是我可以在广西自由行动。
Now I'm in an awkward position. I got the health code on Guangxi's official Guangxi Health Code, which shows green, which means I can move freely in Guangxi.
也就是说，以前隔离我的这个决定是错误的，可是，没有人来纠正这个明显的错误。
In other words, the previous decision to isolate me was wrong, but there was no one to correct this glaring error.
3月10日这天上午，我得到了广西上思县疫情防控指挥部一位姓黄的副主任的电话号码，我给他发了短信。
On the morning of March 10, I got the phone number of a deputy director of Guangxi's Shanxi Prefecture Outbreak Control Command, whose name was Huang. I sent him a text message.
我又一次解释了我的情况，我跟他说，我是一个企业负责人，我的企业在湖北、湖南、广西、广东、海南等多省经营，正在积极推进复工复产，我觉得隔离我的做法不符合相关规定，希望指挥部能够来调查。
I explained my situation once again, and I told him that I was the head of an enterprise, that my business was operating in Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, Guangdong and Hainan provinces, and that I was actively promoting the resumption of work.
当天下午我得到答复，他说指挥部做了研究，决定我应该继续隔离。
I got an answer that afternoon, and he said the command had done research and decided that I should stay in isolation.
无奈之下，3月10日下午我通过12345市民服务热线反映我的情况，热线为我做了加急处理，当晚，文旅局、工信部、疾控中心等部门都分别与我联系核实情况，虽然他们很辛苦，但是漫长的调查之路，何时是个头呢？我不是从重点地区来的，现在却跟真正从重点地区来的人员隔离在一起，是不是也有感染疾病的风险？我希望指挥部能替我考虑一下。
In the afternoon of March 10, I reported my condition through the 12345 Citizen's Helpline, which gave me an urgent response. That night, the Bureau of Arts and Tourism, the Ministry of Industry and Communications and the CDC contacted me to check the situation.
