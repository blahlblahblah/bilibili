一、基本情况（一）武汉市社会福利院情况武汉市社会福利院，设计床位814张床位，内设武汉济民老年医院，设一个门诊部，一个康复科病房和综合病房。
Basic Facts (1) Wuhan City Social Welfare Home Wuhan City Social Welfare Home with 814 beds, Wuhan Jiemin Geriatric Hospital, an outpatient department, a rehabilitation ward and a general ward.
该院地处此次疫情中心地（华南海鲜市场）对面，防控难度大、感染机率高。
The hospital is located in the center of the epidemic (South China seafood market) opposite, prevention and control difficulties, high infection rate.
疫情发生时，院内人员共有656人，其中服务对象458人（自理老人80人，介助56人，介护322人），职工190人，物业人员21人，陪护人员8人。
At the time of the outbreak, there were 656 hospital staff, of whom 458 were clients (80 taking care of the elderly, 56 referred and 322 referred), 190 employees, 21 property personnel and 8 escorts.
截至2月19日，该院累计确诊病例12例，其中老人11例（含死亡1人）、职工1例；疑似病例19例，其中老人7例、职工12例，所有确诊和疑似人员已送隔离点、方舱医院和定点医院分类救治。
As at 19 February, the hospital had a cumulative total of 12 confirmed cases, of which 11 were elderly (including 1 death) and 1 was an employee; there were 19 suspected cases, of which 7 were elderly and 12 were staff members.
该院从1月21日开始实行封闭管理，1月24日全院在汉职工停止休假，立即返岗，吃住在院，所有人员除医疗和生活补给外禁止出入。
The hospital has been under closed administration since January 21, and on January 24 the entire hospital stopped taking leave of absence for Han staff, immediately returned to work, ate and stayed in the hospital.
在疫情初期，该院根据市卫健委指派的专家意见，按照“两区三通道”措施进行传染防控，鉴于武汉疫情初期的医疗资源紧张状态和院内老人行动不便等客观困难，为避免外出感染风险，该院在院内设立了发热病人临时观察区，将发热、咳嗽等新冠肺炎疑似症状人员进行隔离观察，由院内医院对发热人员进行隔离、诊治。
In the early stage of the epidemic, the hospital, on the advice of experts appointed by the municipal health committee, carried out infection prevention and control in accordance with the "two districts, three channels" measures. To avoid the risk of infection outside the hospital, the hospital set up a temporary observation area for fever patients to avoid the risk of infection.
在医疗资源相对缓和后，为更加准确地对院内老人实行分类管理，经过多次与辖区疾控中心联系，该院先后于2月11日领取40人份、2月14日领取300人份核酸检测采样试管，对院内疑似人员进行采样送检。
After the relative relaxation of medical resources, and in order to more accurately classify the elderly in the hospital, after many contacts with the jurisdiction CDC, the hospital received 40 people on 11 February and 300 nucleic acid test tubes on 14 February, respectively, to sample and deliver samples to suspected residents of the hospital.
从2月16日起，又增加了CT排查。
An additional CT scan was added from 16 February.
对于排查出来的确诊、疑似病例立即向相关医疗机构转移，没有网上报道中所说11名老人因反复发烧、呼吸衰竭而死的问题。
Diagnosed and suspected cases were immediately referred to the relevant medical institutions, and there were no online reports of 11 elderly people dying of repeated fever, respiratory failure.
目前，该院所有病例，除1名老人在转院途中死亡外，9人转到市优抚医院隔离治疗；9人转到蔡甸方舱隔离治疗；7人到湖北省中西医结合医院隔离治疗；2人到街道指定酒店隔离治疗。

因疫情期发生时逢春节，部分护理人员回乡，疫情期间该院所有护理员和医护人员均要参与老人护理服务，所以有部分医护人员感染，该院护士吕某，排查时CT显示有肺炎，第一次核酸检测为阴性，目前在嘉士庭酒店隔离观察。
Because the outbreak occurred during the Spring Festival, some nursing staff returned to the hospital during the epidemic period, all nursing staff and health care workers are involved in elderly care services, so some of the hospital nurses infected, Lv, screening CT showed pneumonia, the first nucleic acid test negative, is currently isolated at the Carlstine Hotel.
（二）硚口区古田融济康养中心情况经核实了解，网上报道反映的老人胡某芳（女，85岁，系半自理老人，有30年高血压史），于2018年8月15日与其丈夫一起入住硚口区融济古田老年公寓七楼护理区708室。
(2) A verification report on the old man Hu Mengfang (female, 85 years old, a semi-elderly person with a 30-year history of hypertension) was admitted with her husband on August 15, 2018 to Room 708 on the 7th floor of the Loong Chi Koo Tin Apartment for the Elderly.
2020年2月14日晚上22点05分，院方在进行体温检测时发现胡某芳发烧38.5度，但其自述无其他不适，该院对其使用退热栓及口服用药后，并将老人情况用电话告知了其女儿，建议外出检查，但其女儿说先在院观察。

After taking antipyretic suppository and oral administration, the hospital informed his daughter by telephone of the condition and advised him to go out for examination.
该老人在用药2小时后复测体温降至36.8度，当晚监测体温正常，因老人有发热症状，且与丈夫肖某同房居住，该院要求隔离居住，但老人不愿意分开，院方只能将老人夫妻暂时安排住在一起。
The elderly man's temperature dropped to 36.8 degrees after 2 hours of medication, and his temperature was normal that night. He had fever and was living in the same house as her husband, Xiao.
2月15日、16日老人体温正常，期间偶有咳嗽现象，食欲差。

经检查体温、血压、心跳、呼吸后发现其心跳加速，嘴巴发青，初步判断肺部有炎症。

院方马上予以吸氧治疗，并多次联系家属外出检查治疗，告知其生命随时有危险，但其家属以市区禁行，楼栋为发热楼栋无法出行为由，一直拒绝到院，只能由该院内设的医疗机构采取服抗病毒药物、中药汤剂及吸氧进行保守治疗。
The hospital immediately received oxygen treatment and contacted his family for medical treatment on several occasions, informing them that his life was in imminent danger. However, his family refused to come to the hospital because of the urban ban and the building was a hot building. Instead, the hospital's medical institutions used antiviral drugs, Chinese medicine decoction and oxygen inhalation for conservative treatment.
2月17日至18日，老人情况稳定，精神好转，还与其家属视频通话，但2月19日老人病情恶化，于早上6点15分因呼吸衰竭不幸去世。
From 17 to 18 February, the elderly were in stable condition, in good spirits and had video conversations with their families, but on 19 February the elderly deteriorated and died of respiratory failure at 6.15 a.m.
老人去世后，院方第一时间通知家属，家属以小区封闭不能外出为由，未到养老院处理丧事。
When the old man died, the hospital first informed his family that the family could not go out because the closed community, not to deal with the funeral home.
经硚口区民政局反复协调，2月19日下午4时30分，其子肖某同意签订委托协议，全权委托养老院办理老人后事。
Through repeated coordination with the Civil Affairs Bureau of Zhoukou District, February 19 4: 30 p.m., his son agreed to sign a trust agreement, the elderly entrusted with full powers to the elderly.
胡某芬一直由护工刘某负责，目前刘某本人身体体症正常，无发热等现象。

报道反映的护工唐某华从过年前一直在养老院上岗，并没有回汉川、没有与该老人接触。
The report reported that nursing worker Tang Meihua has been working in the nursing home since the New Year, did not return to Hanchuan, did not contact the elderly.
报道所说的另外一名护工张某，同样也没有接触该老人，早在2月11日就因发热、CT检查为疑似，转送方舱医院。
Zhang, another nurse, also did not have access to the elderly, as early as February 11 because of fever, CT examination as suspected, referred to the cabin hospital.
因老人未做CT和核酸检测，且护理该老人的护工身体正常，也无法将该老人定性为疑似病例。
The elderly person could not be characterized as a suspected case because of the absence of CT and nucleic acid testing and the fact that the caretaker was in good health.
二、相关处置对于网上反映的武汉市社会福利院问题，2月19日、20日该院负责人多次到隔离点进行了面对面沟通，但当事人情绪激动，说酒店没有医疗保障，要求尽快转入方舱治疗。
On Feb. 19 and Feb. 20, the director of Wuhan Municipal Social Welfare Home made several face-to-face exchanges with the residents, but said the hotel had no medical care and asked to be transferred to the hospital as soon as possible.
由于按照规定，没有经过核酸检测阳性，暂时不能转入方舱医院。

目前，已经安排进行对其进行再次核酸检查，同时将尽量满足当事人的要求，争取理解与支持。

硚口区民政局、融济古田老年公寓的负责人也正在与当事人进行解释沟通。
