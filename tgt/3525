不依赖于硬核的疫情防控，才是真功夫。
Prevention and control of diseases that do not depend on hard nuclei is real kung fu.
”我一直认为，上海的新冠疫情防控工作，做到今天地步，真是奇迹！理由千万条，此处说三条。
I have always believed that it is a miracle that Shanghai has been able to control the new crown epidemic to the point where it is today.
内地人口密度最大城市的防控之难美国著名学者麦克尼尔，在其作品《瘟疫与人》中，专门强调人口密度与瘟疫传播的正比例关系。
In his book Plague and Man, McNeill, a well-known American scholar, focuses on the positive correlation between population density and the spread of the plague.
当人类数量增加时，受感染的概率也会增加；随着人口密度增大，寄生物获得新宿主的机会也就增加了。
As the number of humans increases, so does the probability of infection; as population density increases, so does the opportunity for parasites to acquire new hosts.
当这种趋势越过关键性门槛，感染就会一发而不可收，严重阻碍人类的正常活动。
When this trend crosses the critical threshold, the infection becomes unstoppable and seriously impedes normal human activity.
如果普遍蔓延，就会削减人口，直到当地人口密度下降到过度感染门槛以下。
If widespread, the population will be reduced until the local population density falls below the threshold of overinfection.
如果我们未曾经历某次瘟疫大流行，阅读这段文字，几乎波澜不惊；唯有亲历，才能感受到惊心动魄。
If we had not experienced a pandemic, reading this passage would have been almost uneventful; only first-hand experience would have been breathtaking.
事实上，城市的密集人口、狭窄的居住空间、拥挤的交通，在带动经济高速发展的同时，也为病毒的人际传播，提供了绝佳的感染链条。
Indeed, urban agglomerations, cramped living spaces, and congested transportation, while driving high-speed economic growth, also provide excellent infection chains for human-to-human transmission of the virus.
根据人口密度的传播理论，我专门制作了一张表，将内地31个省区市的人口密度、新冠确诊总人数，进行排序，进一步又计算出每百万人的确诊人数。
Based on the theory of population density, I have produced a table that ranks the population density of the 31 provinces and municipalities in the interior, the total number of people diagnosed with the new crown, and further calculates the number of confirmed cases per million people.
我的个人观点，要对比考察某个地区的新冠疫情防控能力，不能仅看总确诊数，还要看每百万人的确诊数。
My personal point of view, to compare the ability of a certain region to control the new crown disease, not just the total number of diagnoses, but also the number of confirmed cases per million people.
为什么？打个比方，一个小村子，10个人，5人确诊为新冠，这个村子新冠感染率就是50%；另一个大村子，100人，10个人确诊为新冠，这个村子新冠感染率仅10%。
For example, a small village, 10 people, 5 people were diagnosed with the new crown, which is 50 per cent; another large village, with 100 people, and 10 people were diagnosed with the new crown, which is only 10 per cent.
如果仅看确诊总人数，有意义吗？需要说明的是，该表数据均来自官方；该表没有将中国港澳台列入统计，一是三地启动疫情防控的时间较早；二是内地人口流动的便捷程度，远高于三地。
If we look only at the total number of people diagnosed, does it make sense? The table does not include Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan in the official statistics.
根据以上四表，可以得知，上海的人口密度内地最大，每平方公里达3848人，几乎是人口密度第二的天津市3倍。
According to the four tables above, Shanghai has the largest population density in the interior, 3,848 people per square kilometre, almost three times the population density of Tianjin City.
平均每260平米，就有1人，应该说，疫情防控条件，非常不利，上海做得如何？1、按总确诊人数由多到少排序，上海列第14位。
On average, there is one person for every 260 square meters, so to speak, the conditions of epidemic prevention and control are very unfavorable, how is Shanghai doing?
2、按每百万人确诊人数由多到少排序，上海列第9位。
2. The number of confirmed cases per million people is in descending order. Shanghai ranks ninth.
3、四个直辖市的由多到少排序，总确诊数、每百万人确诊数，均列第3。
The total number of diagnoses and the number of confirmed cases per million people are listed in the third place.
理论上，除了湖北，上海的防控难度，内地第一，能够取得如此战绩，如果说是全靠运气？你信吗？没有硬核才是真硬核自1月23日凌晨，武汉“封城”，31个省市区，纷纷启动重大突发公共卫生事件一级响应，时间表分别如下：1月23日， 浙江、广东、湖南。
In theory, apart from Hubei, Shanghai's control difficulties, the mainland's first, to achieve such a record, if only by luck? Do you believe? Since the early morning of January 23, Wuhan "closed the city", 31 provinces and municipalities, launched major public health emergencies, the schedule is as follows: January 23, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Hunan.
1月24日，湖北、安徽、天津、北京、上海、重庆、四川、江西、云南、贵州、山东、福建、广西、河北。
January 24, Hubei, Anhui, Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shandong, Fujian, Guangxi and Hebei.
1月25日，江苏、海南、新疆、河南、黑龙江、甘肃、辽宁、山西、陕西、青海、吉林、宁夏、内蒙古。
January 25, Jiangsu, Hainan, Xinjiang, Henan, Heilongjiang, Gansu, Liaoning, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Qinghai, Jilin, Ningxia and Inner Mongolia.
1月29日，西藏。
29 January, Tibet.
几乎和一级响应同时，各种硬核措施，纷纷出炉，有的堆石头，有的挖断路，还有的焊大门。
Almost at the same time as the first response, a variety of hard core measures, some stones, some broken roads, some welding gates.
疫情期间，我宅在家中刷新闻，当时就感到疑虑，如此硬核，真的科学吗？消防、抢修、急救怎么办？果然，没过多久，硬核阻断交通的防控措施，负作用很快显现，公安部开始发文，严禁违法封路。
During the epidemic, I was in the home to brush the news, at that time feel skeptical, so hard core, true science? Fire-fighting, rush repair, first aid What? Sure enough, soon after, hard core blocked traffic control measures, negative effects soon appeared, the Ministry of Public Security began to issue a letter strictly prohibiting illegal road closure.
在上海，我没听到过如此彪悍的新闻。
In Shanghai, I had never heard such a tough story.
我所知道的这座城市，向来以人为本，以科技为本，而不是以硬核为本。
The city I know has always been people-centered, technology-based, not hard-core.
举几个新闻中看到的例子吧。
Take a few examples from the news.
2月2日，上海市民“排队领口罩排出了北欧的感觉”，冲上微博热搜。
On Feb. 2, Shanghai residents "queued up to get rid of the Nordic feeling of masks", rushed to Weibo hot search.
上海人的一米式排队，为全国做出了最早的示范。
The one-meter line of Shanghainese is the earliest example for the whole country.
2月22日，上海杨浦区江浦街道，开始试点智能门磁，在居家隔离人员的门上安装之后，一旦打开家门，就会在一键告警，推送短消息到对接责任人的手机上，提醒关注该户隔离人员的开门情况。
On Feb. 22, Shanghai Yangpu District, Jiangpu Street, began experimenting with smart gate magnetism. Once installed on the door of a home quarantined person, once the door is opened, the door will be alerted and text messages will be sent to the cellphone of the person who docked the person responsible, alerting them to the opening of the door.
同样在2月中旬，“上海造”声控电梯，开始亮相，不仅在沪上多家医院和商场加装，还支援了湖北，只要告诉电梯去几楼即可，避免了公共场所的接触式传播。
Also in mid-February, the "Shanghai-built" audio-controlled elevator made its debut, not only in Shanghai a number of hospitals and shopping malls, but also to support Hubei, as long as the elevator told a few floors to avoid contact transmission in public places.
到了3月初，有新闻报道，声控电梯又升级了，居然出现了方言版。
By the beginning of March, there were news reports that the sound-controlled elevator had been upgraded to include the Fangyue version.
所谓硬核，实质上就是简单粗暴。
The so-called hard core is essentially simple and rough.
不依赖于硬核的疫情防控，才是真功夫。
Prevention and control of diseases that do not depend on hard nuclei is real kung fu.
“上海式”闭环防输入背后的精细化今天新闻中看到，上海机场防控人员，制订《接送重点国家入境人员隔离观察工作方案》，分为浦东机场版、虹桥机场版，近50条工作流程，每日优化、更新。
"Shanghai-style" closed-loop anti-input back of the news today, the Shanghai airport control personnel, the formulation of a "pick-up of key countries to observe the work of isolation," divided into Pudong Airport Edition, Hongqiao Airport version, nearly 50 workflow, daily optimization, update.
对所有入境人员，实施“上海式”闭环管理。
For all incoming personnel, "Shanghai-style" closed-loop management shall be implemented.
看完全文，我很吃惊！不得不说，上海的精细化管理，用于新冠防输入，如虎添翼！简单介绍我所理解的上海式闭环“铁布衫”。
I am surprised to read the full text! I have to say that the fine management of Shanghai, used for new crown defense input, such as Tiger Add Wing!
第一环，飞机落地、旅客分流、流行病学调查、区分是否重点疫区来宾、张贴颜色标签（绿标放行、红标与黄标进入隔离流程）、红外测温、边检入境、行李消毒。
First Ring, aircraft landing, passenger diversion, epidemiological investigation, identification of key affected area guests, colour labeling (Green Label clearance, red mark and yellow mark entering the isolation process), infrared temperature measurement, border control entry, luggage disinfection.
第二环：上海16个区的机场驻点人员对接、安排安通送达相应区的旅客集散点、集散点再与各街镇交接、街镇再与居住地对接。
Second Ring: The personnel stationed in 16 districts of Shanghai shall dock and arrange for Antong to reach the passenger distribution points and distribution points in the corresponding districts, and then join the streets and towns and docking with their places of residence.
第三环，来沪人员居住地的落地管理。
Third Ring, to Shanghai personnel residence on the landing management.
通过人工接力，一条全封闭的回家之路，形成了。
Through the artificial relay, a completely closed way home, formed.
三个闭环，环环相扣，又整体组成了一个完整的防输入大闭环，对所有来沪的入境人员，都做到了全流程的跟踪与观察。
Three closed-loop, interlocking, and the whole form of a complete anti-input large closed loop, to all people entering Shanghai, have done the whole process of tracking and observation.
这是一项史无前例、没有经验可循的工作，而这项工作的有序开展，正是依靠了标准的精细化、流程的精细化，让管理和服务相结合，既守住了国门、城门，又能让来宾感受来自上海的热情，工作量何其巨大？新冠战疫，到现在的阶段，效率已被迫让位于安全，这是没有办法的办法，既定的程序，一个也不能少。
This is an unprecedented and inexperienced work, which is carried out in an orderly manner through standard refinement and refinement of the process, combining management and service, keeping the gate and city gate under control and letting the guests experience the enthusiasm and workload of Shanghai.
唯有如此，才能为这座内地最高人口密度的大城，构建起安全之墙。
Only in this way can a wall of security be built for the most densely populated city in the interior.
换个角度，境外来沪客人，看到这般严阵以待，他们也会这座安全的城市，感到欣慰吧！在新冠病毒全球传播、无孔不入、到处肆虐的时期，谁愿意呆在一个不设防的城市？多年以后，这场新冠战疫，必将载入人类史，人们一定会惊叹于中国在这场伟大战疫中，所付出的巨大牺牲、所取得的巨大成绩！而带着上海特色的防疫战斗，它既将成为中国战疫史的一个重要组成部分，又何尝不是全体上海人的共同记忆？。
After years of spreading, ubiquitous and rampant around the globe, who is willing to stay in an undefended city? Many years later, the new epidemic will be remembered with great sacrifice and achievement.
