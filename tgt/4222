从暂停到重启，这位武汉纪录片导演记录了过去60天的武汉。
From the pause to the reboot, the Wuhan documentary director chronicled the past 60 days of Wuhan.

两个月前的1月23日，武汉封城，900万人的城市，被一纸通知紧急暂停。
Two months ago, on January 23, Wuhan, the city of 9 million people, was called into emergency suspension.
整整两个月后的今天，武汉迎来复工后的第一个工作日，这座城市正在缓慢重启。
Exactly two months later, Wuhan, the first working day after the resumption of work, is slowly restarting the city.
过去的60天，是武汉全民战役的六十天，也是导演程逸飞拍摄武汉抗疫纪录片的六十天。
The past 60 days, Wuhan is the 60-day campaign, director Cheng Yi-fei shooting Wuhan anti-epidemic documentary 60 days.
从封城之日起，他的《决战江城之巅》纪录片每日一更。
From the day the city was sealed, his documentary The Top of the Rise of the Armageddon was released daily.
他形容它为“不一样的日记”：舍弃私密性，坚持日更，传递正能量。
He described it as a "different diary": forsaking privacy, sticking to the daily routine and delivering positive energy.
程逸飞说自己的纪录片是拍给身在武汉的人看的，告诉武汉人他们没有被放弃。
Cheng said his documentary was shot at people in Wuhan and told the Wuhan people that they had not been given up.
他拍志愿者、医疗队、环卫工、外卖员、病人家属、社区工作者——一切和疫情有关的人。
He filmed volunteers, medical teams, sanitation workers, take-out workers, patients' families, community workers - all related to the epidemic.
镜头里有人沉默，有人哭泣，但更多的人握紧拳头大喊加油。
There were people who were silent and crying, but many more clenched their fists and shouted for gas.
他把那些和死亡有关的素材暂时搁置在电脑硬盘深处，每天发布对志愿者和医疗队的记录，“他们与病毒的斗争鼓舞人心。
"Their fight against the virus is inspiring," he says, putting the death-related material on hold deep in his computer's hard drive and posting daily notes to volunteers and medical teams.
”甚至在遇见了越来越多的志愿者后，他自己也受到鼓舞，成为了其中的一员。
Even after meeting more and more volunteers, he was encouraged to become one of them.
我们无法再重新走进2020年的凌冽初春，但是它们理应以任何方式被记录在册。
We cannot re-enter the sharp spring of 2020, but they should be recorded in any way.
今天，我们打算记录这个在过去的两个月里没有停止记录的人。
Today, we intend to record the person who has not stopped recording in the past two months.
这些记录也许只是时代里的一粒流沙，但是千万个它们，或许可以拼凑起一座真相之塔。
These records may be just a grain of quicksand in the ages, but tens of thousands of them may have pieced together a tower of truth.
以下是程逸飞导演的叙述。
The following is the account of director Cheng Yifai.
总要有人说真话一月二十二日中午十一点左右，我在汉阳的一家菜市场买菜。
On January 22nd, at about 11 o'clock noon, I was buying vegetables at a vegetable market in Hanyang.
摊贩们都在收摊，管理方催着，要十二点前收完然后消毒，从他们那里我打听到第二天封城的消息。
The vendors were on the stalls, and the authorities were urging them to collect and disinfect them by twelve o'clock, and I got news from them of the next day's closure.
作为一名长期在武汉工作和生活的导演，我觉得有必要做点事情。
As a director who has been working and living in Wuhan for a long time, I think it is necessary to do something.
疫情初期媒体上不准确的信息传播了很多恐惧，所以我想去一线拍摄纪录片，将真实的信息传递给大众。
The inaccurate information in the media at the beginning of the epidemic spread a lot of fear, so I wanted to make a first-line documentary to get the real message across to the public.
程逸飞导演我的妻子是武汉人，两个孩子都出生在武汉中心医院，李文亮医生战斗过的地方。
Director Cheng Yifai my wife is Wuhan, two children were born in Wuhan Central Hospital, Dr. Lee Wenliang battle place.
老二现在一岁半，时刻要人照顾，如果我外出拍摄，压力会全部落在妻子身上，而且要冒着和家人双重感染的风险。
The sophomore is now 18 1 / 2 years old, and if I go out shooting, the stress will fall on my wife and I risk co-infection with my family.
但我没纠结太久。
But I didn't worry too long.
03年非典时我在北京经历了全程，那时情况没现在严重，就是天天喝板蓝根，戴口罩，还能去复兴门的百盛商场逛逛。
When SARS happened in Beijing in 2003, I went through a whole journey. It wasn't as bad as it is now. I drank Banlangen every day, wore a mask, and went to Baisheng Shopping Mall.
而这次是建国以来头一遭的封城，总要有人说点真话。
And this is the first time since the founding of the city, always someone to say the truth.
当晚，我决定制作武汉首部抗击新型肺炎纪录片——《决战江城之巅》。
That night, I decided to make Wuhan's first documentary film on fighting the new pneumonia, "Top of the Rise."
我的妻子很支持我，说如果不是有两个孩子，一定和我并肩作战。
My wife was very supportive and said she would have fought alongside me if I hadn't had two children.
她的话给了我很大的鼓励。
Her words gave me a great deal of encouragement.
我也从朋友那里得到了许多帮助，像中夏古建集团的卫董，第一时间就决定赞助口罩。
I also received a lot of help from friends, such as the Middle Xia Gujian Group Wei Dong, the first time decided to sponsor masks.
这次疫情就像一面照妖镜，照见了人性的种种善恶。
This outbreak is like a magic mirror to see the good and evil of human nature.
我因此得到了一些朋友，也拉黑了一些曾以为是朋友的人。
As a result, I got some friends and blackened some who had thought they were friends.
当然，得到的都是可以一辈子深交的朋友。
Of course, get a lifetime of friends.
1月23日程逸飞与卫董的聊天截图虽然做了拍摄的决定，但我肯定是害怕的。
January 23 Yi Fei and Wei Dong chat screenshot made the decision to shoot, but I must be afraid.
每次回家前，我都会把所有的防护扔掉，用酒精对自己和车做最高级别的消毒，然后第一时间洗热水澡。
Every time I go home, I throw away all the protection, disinfect myself and my car with alcohol at the highest level, and then take the first hot bath.
感染家人是我最害怕的事。
infecting my family is my biggest fear.
在外拍摄时，我也不敢吃喝拉撒。
I dare not eat or drink Lazarus while shooting outside.
饿了就摘下口罩啃几口压缩饼干，快速喝一点水。
When you're hungry, take off your mask and nibble on a few crackers. Drink some water quickly.
但我不敢喝太多，五十多天了车上的矿泉水只喝了半瓶。
But I dare not drink too much, more than 50 days of the car's mineral water only half a bottle.
口袋里用来补充能量的士力架也常常忘了吃——饿过那个劲儿就忘了。
The power rack in the pocket to replenish the energy often forgets to eat - and forgets when hungry.
除了饮食，我的作息也受到影响，主要看当天的拍摄情况。
In addition to diet, my work and rest have also been affected, mainly depending on the day of shooting.
我现在每天早的七点多起床，晚的九点多，中午之前出门。
I get up more than seven in the morning, more than nine in the evening, and go out before noon.
晚上回家后导出素材、剪辑、配音，然后发布，还要与志愿者、采访对象、医疗队沟通，策划第二天的拍摄内容，基本两三点睡。
After returning home at night, they export materials, clips, dubbing, and then release them. They also communicate with volunteers, interviewees, and medical teams to plan the next day's filming.
幸好19年我坚持锻炼身体，现在是我近两年来身体状况和免疫力最好的时候，这样的工作节奏对身体没有影响。
Fortunately, after 19 years of consistent exercise, this is the best time I've had my health and immunity for almost two years, and the pace of work has no effect on my body.
二月初我开始喝肺炎二号中药，上周还做了次ct，结果显示我的身体很健康。
I started drinking TCM Pneumonia II in early February and had a second CT scan last week, which showed that I was in good health.
只要身体受得住，我会一直拍到疫情结束，结束后也会跟拍灾后重建，民众的心理恢复，还有中小企业的困境。
As long as the body can bear, I will continue to film the end of the epidemic, the end of the post-disaster reconstruction, the psychological recovery of the people, and the plight of small and medium-sized enterprises.
两江三岸的悲欢与爱我的拍摄团队有五个人：导演，摄影，策划，编剧和配音，都是我的朋友。
There are five people on my shooting team: director, photographer, planner, screenwriter and dubbing, all of whom are my friends.
刚开始拍的时候我们没什么名气，要想办法寻找拍摄对象，也有时间看看评论。
We were not famous at the beginning. We had time to find someone to shoot and to read the reviews.
现在有一些知名度了，许多线索主动找来，就需要策划拍什么。
Now there is some publicity, a lot of clues to find the initiative to shoot what needs to be planned.
在我心中《决胜江城之巅》有两条主线，一条是地理，另一条是爱。
There are two main lines in my mind, one is geography, the other is love.
武汉是一座江城，长江和汉江两条大江笔直穿过，所以我打算沿着江走，拍摄两岸的人民——这是绕不开的。
Wuhan is a river city. The Yangtze River and the Han River go straight through it. So I plan to walk along the river and photograph the people on both sides of the strait.
我拍了各种各样的普通人。
I took pictures of all kinds of ordinary people.
有冒雨配送的快递员，在空旷的马路上打扫的环卫工，偷溜出来冬泳的老人，华南海鲜市场二楼眼镜店的小哥，还有来自全国各地的志愿者和医疗团队。
There are couriers in the rain, sanitation workers sweeping the open road, old men sneaking out of winter swimmers, the younger brother at the eyeglass shop on the second floor of the South China Seafood Market, volunteers and medical teams from all over the country.
前些天我拍摄了一个新生婴儿。
The other day I took a picture of a newborn baby.
母亲是单亲妈妈，二十二岁，浙江人，未婚先孕，孩子的爸爸找不到人了，所以整个生产过程由志愿者团队帮忙。
The mother was a single mother, 22 years old, Zhejiang, unmarried pregnant, the child's father could not find anyone, so the entire production process was helped by a volunteer team.
孩子出生后，取名叫武志城，武汉众志成城的意思。
After the birth of the child, named Wuzhi City, Wuhan Zhisheng meaning.
疫情结束后我有一个计划，把拍摄到的素材剪成一部电影，我想把这个婴儿作为里面的一条故事线。
After the outbreak, I had a plan to cut the footage into a movie, and I wanted to use the baby as a story line.
出舱你问我为什么《决战江城之巅》系列都是“正能量”，没有“苦难”的部分，这个问题非常好。
Out of the hatch You asked me why the "Top of the Armageddon" series is "positive energy," no "suffering" part, and that's a very good question.
因为那一类视频是拍给武汉外的人看的，了解武汉的真实情况，而我是拍给在武汉的人看的，传播爱和积极的情绪，因为我要照顾包括身在医院的八万人的心理。
Because that kind of video is for people outside Wuhan to see, understand the real situation in Wuhan, and I am shooting to Wuhan people to spread love and positive emotions, because I have to take care of the 80, 000 people including those in the hospital.
我拍乳腺癌电影十二年，所以特别关注患者心理。
I make breast cancer movies for twelve years, so pay special attention to patient psychology.
什么是癌，没法解决的叫癌，这次的病毒也没法立刻解决。
What is cancer, which is incurable called cancer, this time the virus can not be solved immediately.
很多情况你不是身在武汉就不能理解，它给人造成的心理压力有多大。
In many cases you can not understand that you are not in Wuhan, it caused by the psychological pressure of how much.
所以我拍摄“正能量”的目的，是不希望人们一直沉浸在悲痛当中，带给大家微笑和希望。
So my goal in shooting Positive Energy is not to keep people in mourning, to bring everyone a smile and hope.
疫情过去之后我们再反思、再追责也来得及。
After the epidemic is over, we can reflect and retrace our responsibilities.
我最近一直在拍医疗队和志愿者。
I've been shooting medical teams and volunteers lately.
管控变严后，现在还在外面活动的志愿者大概有三千多人，其中很多都没和家里讲，是背着出来的。
With tighter controls in place, there are now about 3,000 volunteers out there, many of whom do not speak to their families and are carrying them off their backs.
像白色情人节那天，我在武汉血液中心拍摄献血的志愿者，一个朋友从始至终都在回避镜头。
Like white Valentine's Day, I took pictures of volunteers donating blood at Wuhan Blood Center. A friend evaded the camera from start to finish.
之前他的老婆发现了手机中他做志愿服务时拍摄的照片，大闹了一番，这次他是偷偷出来的，献完血后连送的小礼物和献血证都不敢拿。
His wife had made a scene when she spotted a picture of him volunteering on her cell phone, this time secretly, not even taking a small gift or blood donation card.
视频中我给他打了马赛克。
I gave him a mosaic in the video.
还有一个志愿者让我印象很深刻。
I was impressed by one more volunteer.
98年的小姑娘，对着镜头说自己长大了。
Little girl of '98, telling the camera that she's grown up.
她是红十字会在编的志愿者，但口罩要自己买，住宿自己找，晚上住在车里，条件非常苦。
She was a Red Cross volunteer, but had to buy her own mask, find her own accommodation and stay in the car at night, in very difficult conditions.
至于为什么是这样的情况，他们是这么说的，咱们就不深究了。
As to why this is the case, they say so, and we shall not delve into it.
不能承受的生命之轻我有很多拍摄素材现在不能展示。
The Unbearable Lightness of Life I have so much material that I can't show now.
一种是背着家里做事的志愿者；另一种是失去亲人的受访人，现在放出来，对他们来说是二次伤害。
One is a volunteer working behind the back of his or her back; the other is a interviewee who has lost a loved one and is now released, a secondary injury to them.
我也不想传播更多的负面情绪。
I also don't want to spread more negative emotions.
但我确实拍到了不少让我压抑的故事。
But I did get a lot of depressing stories.
比如我第一次哭，是疫情刚开始，拍摄第九集在协和医院遇到的一位大姐。
The first time I cried, for example, was the beginning of the epidemic, filming the ninth episode in Concorde Hospital met a big sister.
当时医院有几千人涌进去，但只有几十个床位，走廊上都是人，输液的支架不够用，就去院子里找根棍子插着。
There were thousands of people in the hospital, but there were only a few dozen beds. The hallway was filled with people and there was not enough support for the infusion.
大姐对着镜头哭了五分钟，她后悔把爸妈带回武汉，现在只能在走廊里躺着。
Big sister cried into the camera for five minutes, she repented taking her parents back to Wuhan, now can only lie in the corridor.
那时候我才第一次真正意识到疫情的危险。
It was then that I realized for the first time the danger of the epidemic.
我第二次哭是二月六号李文亮医生去世那天，第二天有许多人来武汉中心医院追思，在门口送花，鞠躬。
The second time I cried was the day Dr. Li Wenliang died on February 6. The next day many people came to Wuhan Central Hospital to think about it and send flowers and bows.
晚上有八辆车打双闪为他送别。
Eight cars double-flashed him off at night.
我坐在车里痛哭流泪。
I sat in the car sobbing.
这是疫情的一个节点。
This is a node of the epidemic.
对很多人来说，这次疫情造成了很大的心理创伤，在结束后需要长久的心理重建。
For many people, the epidemic has been traumatic and will require long-term psychological rebuilding after it is over.
我采访到一位女性，二月二十八号是她结婚十九周年纪念日，孩子今年十八岁。
I interviewed a woman who celebrated her nineteenth wedding anniversary on February 28th. Her child was eighteen.
她的丈夫二月十八号在金银潭医院去世，而她自己如今正在接受湖南心理团队的治疗。
Her husband died on February 18th at Golden and Silver Pool Hospital, and she is now being treated by the Hunan Psychological Team.
那天她对着镜头说：“疫情好与不好对我来说有什么意义呢？疫情好了我也没老公了，以前在家我什么事都不用做。
The other day she looked into the camera and said, "What does it mean to me to have a good or bad epidemic? I don't have a husband and I didn't have to do anything at home.
儿子每天都在看别人的故事，没想到这次自己成了别人看的故事。
Every day my son was reading other people's stories, but this time he turned out to be someone else's story.
”武汉客厅方舱医院广东医疗队面对这些人的时候，对我们的心理也是一次创伤。
Wuhan living room square cabin hospital Guangdong medical team when facing these people, it is also a trauma to our psychology.
趁着采访心理治疗团队的机会，我也接受了心理治疗。
I took advantage of the interview with the psychotherapy team, And I received psychotherapy.
我虽然没把这部分素材放出来，但现在团队去的地方多了，认识的人和资源也多了，就可以做一些力所能及的事情来帮助他们。
I didn't release that material, but now that the team has gone to more places and knows more people and resources, there are things I can do to help them.
这让我们从拍摄团队变成一个半拍摄半志愿者团队。
This allowed us to move from a team of filmmakers to a semi-volunteer team.
每次采访我都会送几个口罩，也会帮着联系和运送物资。
I send a few masks every time I interview, and I also help to contact and deliver supplies.
我的车上有一半空间都是物资。
Half the space in my car is filled with supplies.
今天我在三镇拍了八个医疗队，车子跑了半箱油，拍完左边胯子酸痛。
Today, I filmed eight medical teams in three towns. The car ran half a carton of oil and finished patting my left crotch.
拍最后一个山西医疗队时，我想借厕所小便，他们不建议，怕我感染病毒。
When I was filming the last Shanxi medical team, I wanted to use the toilet to urinate. They didn't suggest it for fear I might get the virus.
送别援鄂医疗队到目前为止，我拍摄了五六个T的素材，每天晚上为了实现日更，要处理到凌晨两三点。
So far, I have taken five or six T's of material, and I have to deal with it until 2 or 3 in the morning every night to make it a reality.
选用哪些素材或者不选，都需要去考虑。
The choice of materials, or not, needs to be considered.
目前更新的内容在我的公众号“旅小行”上都可以看到。
The current updates can be found in my public address "Travel Trip."
除了这些已经发布的日更记录之外，我对我拍摄的主题有一个更长期的规划。
In addition to these published daily updates, I have a longer-term plan for my subject matter.
先打赢这场“战疫”，等这些结束后，我会再剪一部电影，对这段特殊的时间做完整的回顾。
Win the plague first, and when that's over, I'll cut another film and take a complete look at this particular period of time.
