新冠疫情形势严峻，但非常重要的病毒溯源仍不清晰。
The situation of the new crown is severe, but the source of the very important virus remains unclear.
世卫组织的疫情报告显示，越来越多的证据表明，新型冠状病毒与其他已知的在蝙蝠中传播的冠状病毒存在关联，更具体地讲则是和蝙蝠的菊头蝠科存在关联。
A WHO epidemiological report shows that there is growing evidence that the new coronavirus is linked to other coronavirus known to spread in bats and, more specifically, to the bat's chrysanthemum family.
菊头蝠在中国南方以及整个亚洲、中东、非洲和欧洲广泛存在。
They are widely found in southern China as well as throughout Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe.
而中华菊头蝠，正是当年 SARS 病毒的起源。
Chinese chrysanthemum bats are the origin of the SARS virus.
中国科学院武汉病毒研究所的研究员石正丽经过 13 年的病毒追踪溯源，最终锁定了这一目标，同时指出让 SARS 病毒传播的中间宿主是果子狸。
Shi Zhengli, a researcher at the Wuhan Institute of Virus at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, identified the target after 13 years of tracking the source of the virus, while pointing out that the intermediate host for the spread of the virus is the civet.
目前，新冠病毒的中间宿主尚未确认。
The intermediate host of the new crown virus has not yet been identified.
根据中国疾控中心最初的报告指出，该新型冠状病毒来源于武汉华南海鲜市场销售的野生动物。
According to an initial report from the China CDC, the new coronavirus originated from wild animals sold at Wuhan South China Seafood Market.
而后《柳叶刀》发表的一篇论文却发出质疑，表示此次新型冠状病毒的源头可能在其它地方，在其传播到海鲜市场后，才引发了后续的大规模集中爆发。
But a paper published by The Lancet later questioned whether the new coronavirus could have originated elsewhere, triggering a major subsequent outbreak when it spread to seafood markets.
但无论最初发源地在哪儿，“野生动物”在传播的链条上总归难以撇清关系。
But no matter where they first originated, "wild animals" are hard to disentangle in the chain of communication.
图 | 野生动物交易（来源：Shutterstock）在疾控中心将源头指向华南海鲜市场之后，中国市场监管总局、农业农村部、国家林业和草原局于 1 月 21 日发布紧急通知，加强检验检疫力度，对竹鼠、獾等野生动物饲养繁育场所封控隔离，禁止转运贩卖。
China's General Administration of Market Supervision, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs and the State Forestry and Grassland Administration issued an emergency notice on 21 January to tighten inspection and quarantine measures after the CDC directed its source to the South China seafood market.
在 1 月 26 日，三部门再发公告，宣布在全国疫情解除之前，禁止任何野生动物交易活动。
On 26 January, the three departments issued a further announcement banning any trade in wildlife until the national epidemic was lifted.
而《自然》杂志在 2 月 11 日发布一篇题为《冠状病毒：为什么永久禁止野生动物贸易在中国行不通》（Coronavirus：why a permanent ban on wildlife trade might not work in China）的文章，其表示“中国政府自新型冠状病毒出现后临时禁止了野生动物在国内运输和销售行为，这受到了非政府性环保组织的极大欢迎，并呼吁要将禁令永久实行。
An article in the February 11 issue of the journal Nature entitled Coronavirus: why a permanent ban on wildlife trade is not working in China said that "the Chinese government's temporary ban on the domestic transport and sale of wild animals since the emergence of the new coronavirus has been greatly welcomed by non-governmental environmental groups, which have called for a permanent ban.
但中国对野生动物制品的文化需求，可能意味着全面禁令将适得其反。
But China's cultural demand for wildlife products could mean a blanket ban would be counterproductive.
”在更早的几天，国际权威的医学杂志《柳叶刀》在 2 月 7 日刊登了一篇来自广州大学朱竑教授团队的题为《野味消费与新型冠状病毒》（Game consumption and the 2019 novel coronavirus）的评论文章。
A few days earlier, the world's leading medical journal The Lancet published a commentary by Hong Kong University's Hong Kong University's Hong Kong University team of Hong Kong's Zhejiang University professor Zhu Hong Hong, entitled Game consumption and the 2019 novel coronavirus.
朱竑是国务院政府特殊津贴专家，也是中国地理学会常务理事、中国地理学会研学工作组主任。
Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Zhejiang Province
在文章中朱竑教授认为，中国民间对于食药同源哲学的痴迷，以及对野生动物拥有药效的想象，这增加了自然界中的病毒感染人类的可能。
Hong Hong Hong in the article down in China, Professor Zhu believed that the Chinese people's fascination with the homologous philosophy of medicine, as well as wild animals have the efficacy of the imagination, which increased the likelihood of human infection in nature.
要避免这一问题，则需要人们改变以往的饮食与健康观念，做到与自然和谐文明相处。
To avoid this problem, people need to change the previous concept of diet and health, so as to achieve harmony and civilization with nature.
野味与中国饮食传统谈起“吃”来，或许全球范围内也只有法国可以和中国相媲美。
Perhaps the only country in the world where game and Chinese food traditions are spoken of is France.
作为世界唯二的美食国度，由于有着悠久的历史传统，长期以来不同地区因地理环境、气候物产、文化传统以及民族习俗等因素影响，逐步形成了人们如今熟知的“八大菜系”——粤菜、川菜、鲁菜、苏菜、浙菜、闽菜、湘菜、徽菜。
As the only culinary country in the world, due to its long-standing historical traditions, different regions have gradually formed what is now known as the "eight major cuisines" - Cantonese, Sichuan, Shandong, Su, Zhejiang, Fujian, Xiangcai and Huizhou.
那么吃野味又是从何而来的呢？从唐代刘恂撰写的《岭表录异》中可以了解到唐代岭南道的物产与民情，其中记载最多的便是岭南人的食物，在文中就提及过鹿肉、虎肉、象肉，甚至是吃八哥和鹧鸪鸟的习俗。
Lucian Pye in the Tang Dynasty wrote "Lingnan Road of the property and people of the Tang Dynasty, the most recorded of which is the food of the Lingnan people, including deer meat, tiger meat, elephant meat, and even the custom of eating partridges and coconuts.
而另一种鸟类——猫头鹰（枭）在古代被认为是恶逆之鸟，所以古时盛行捕杀枭作枭羹，借食之以灭枭。
Another kind of bird, owls (owls), was thought to be an evil bird in ancient times, so in ancient times it was widely used to hunt and destroy the Owl.
这一习俗盛行于西周至明代，而延续至清代前中期。
This custom flourished from the Western Zhou Dynasty to the Ming Dynasty and continued until the middle of the Qing Dynasty.
而在南宋时期，周去非编写的《岭外代答》记载了宋代岭南地区（如今的两广一带）的社会经济、少数民族的生活风俗，以及物产资源等情况。
In the Southern Song Dynasty, Zhou Guofei's "Lingnan Mountain" records the social and economic situation of the Lingnan area in Song Dynasty (the present-day area of Liangguang), the living customs of ethnic minorities, and the production resources.
文中同样也记载了当地居民吃野味的习俗。
The local custom of eating game is also recorded in the article.
到了明代，海外贸易的兴起引入了许多海外食材，比如燕窝（燕子的吐沫）等。
By the Ming Dynasty, the rise of overseas trade brought in many foreign ingredients, such as bird's nest (swallow droplets).
这些不一定好吃、但很奇异的食物扩展了当时人们的脑洞，一些古籍上为编排蛮夷记载的奇怪食物纷纷走入酒楼，还有记录中真假难辨、有“食谱药效”的动物（穿山甲、娃娃鱼等）均受“野味珍馐”的风气所害。
These not-so-delicious but exotic foods expanded the brain caves of the time, and some ancient books were filled with barbarian oddities, and the veritable "cookbook effect" of animals (pangolins, baby fish, etc.) was affected by the "meat of the game" culture.
到了清军入关之后，野味逐渐登上了贵胄们的餐桌，慢慢也形成了认为其“稀有少见”“象征贵族身份”的风气。
By the time the Qing army was in customs, the game had gradually ascended to the nobles' table, and had gradually developed a "rare" "aristocratic ethos."
清代作者袁枚所著《随园食单》，是一本记载江浙一带特色饮食的菜谱，其中便将野鸡、果子狸当做常见的一种食物。
Yuan Mei, the author of Qing Dynasty, is a menu of typical foods in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, in which wild chickens and civet beavers are regarded as a common food.
《红楼梦》第七十五回中，贾母就提过将“风腌果子狸”送给林黛玉和贾宝玉吃。
"Dream of Red Mansions" in the seventy-fifth round, Jia Mu mentioned the "wind-pickled fruit beaver" to Lin Daiyu and Jia Baoyu to eat.
图 | 网上爆出的武汉大学出版社出版的图书《动物小百科》中对果子狸的描述（来源：网络）其实，通过现在的科学研究，营养学家们早已证明：野生动物绝大部分并没有特殊的营养价值。
Descriptions of beavers in the book Animal Encyclopedia, published online by Wuhan University Press. In fact, through current scientific research, nutritionists have long demonstrated that the vast majority of wild animals have no particular nutritional value.
同时，也有科学家不断地提醒着人们，食用野味会给人们的健康带来极大的风险，野生动物的身上均携带有大量的病菌和病毒。
At the same time, some scientists are constantly reminding people that eating game poses great risks to people's health. Wild animals carry a large number of germs and viruses on their bodies.
而在研究员石正丽发现 2003 年的 SARS 病毒源头在菊头蝠身上，并且让 SARS 病毒传播的中间宿主是果子狸的时候，就曾对外警示过“在未来，仍有可能出现新的类似 SARS 的病毒”。
When researcher Shi Zhengli discovered that the source of the 2003 SARS virus was at the bat, and that the intermediate host for the spread of the virus was a civet, she warned that "new SARS-like viruses could still emerge in the future."
虽然，果子狸早已基本都是人工养殖的，但鉴于其是危险性如此之大的病毒传播者，人们是否应该重新审视一下将其作为食物饲养的必要性？近日，有网友爆出 2015 年武汉大学出版社出版的《动物小百科》一书中，将果子狸描述为“它们的肉可以吃，是我国历史悠久的稀有山珍”。
Although civet beavers have long been farmed, should people re-examine the need to keep them as food because they are so dangerous carriers of the virus? A netizen recently described civets as "their meat is edible, a rare and long-standing treasure of our country" in the book Animal Encyclopedia published by Wuhan University Press in 2015.
即便从内容角度来看或许没有错误，但在人们已经经历过非典疫情之后，给孩子们做动物认知教育的书籍如此描述或许仍欠考虑。
Even though there may be no mistakes from a content point of view, it may still be unwise to describe books that educate children about animal cognition after people have experienced the SARS epidemic.
为此，武汉大学出版社在 2 月 11 日给出了官方回应，表示其出版的《动物小百科》中存在着关于果子狸的不当表述，已第一时间通知全国各销售网点全面下架该书，其他相关事宜正在继续调查处理中。
As a result, Wuhan University Press on February 11 gave an official response, saying that the publication of "Animal Encyclopedia" contains inappropriate expressions about civet beavers, that the book has been promptly notified to all sales outlets across the country, and that other related matters are being investigated and processed.
图 | 武汉大学出版社对此次事件的回应（来自：微博）由种种细节可见，食用野味在一定程度上，已经在部分人的脑海中形成了其是稀有奇特、有特殊价值，并且能彰显身份地位的一种观念。
The response of Wuhan University Press to the incident can be seen in detail. To some extent, eating game has shaped in some people's minds a notion of rarity, special value, and status.
因此，《自然》杂志上刊登的文章的态度就是，如果将禁止任何野生动物交易活动的禁令改为全面永久实行，极有可能助长不受监管控制和利润更高的非法贸易市场的扩张。
Thus, the attitude of the article published in the journal Nature is that changing the ban on any trade in wildlife to a full and permanent one would most likely encourage the expansion of an illegal trade market that is unregulated and more profitable.
即便在没有全面禁令的过去，野生动物非法贸易，已成为继毒品和军火之外的第三大走私对象。
Even in the absence of a comprehensive ban, the illicit trade in wildlife has become the third largest smuggling target after drugs and arms.
早在 2012 年就有报道称，从东南亚到珠三角，已经形成了完整的走私野生动物贸易链，而这个链条只是为了满足国人的口腹之欲。
Already in 2012, it was reported that from Southeast Asia to the Pearl River Delta, a complete chain of wildlife smuggling had been formed to satisfy the appetite of the people.
因此，如何解决吃野味的这个问题是十分复杂的，需要通过多种抑制消费的举措来解决，比如进行旨在打破根深蒂固的传统野味饮食观念的定向教育运动等。
Therefore, how to solve the problem of eating game is very complex, and need to be solved through various measures to curb consumption, such as targeted education campaigns aimed at breaking down deep-rooted traditional game diets.
在《柳叶刀》的文章中，朱竑研究团队则说：为了控制像 SARS、MERS、埃博拉和新冠病毒等人畜共患病毒疾病的爆发，限制野味消费就是一个很好的办法。
Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Zhejiang Province
不过，文章同时表示：立法只是解决方案的一部分，最终的解决方案在于改变人们对美味、时尚、或者健康饮食的看法。
However, the article also said: legislation is only part of the solution, and the ultimate solution lies in changing people's perception of what is tasty, fashionable, or healthy.
作者相信，改变过时和不适当的食用野生动物及其制品的传统，不仅可以保护野生动物的自然栖息地，还有助于人类和其他生物的和谐共处。
The authors believe that changing the outdated and inappropriate traditions of eating wild animals and their products not only protects the natural habitat of wildlife, but also contributes to the harmonious coexistence of humans and other organisms.
除此之外，自此次新冠肺炎疫情爆发以来，人们在互联网上对“野味”的搜索关注达到了历史峰值，而讨论的热点也聚焦在“野生动物”“远离野味”“禁止交易”等关键词上。
In addition, since the outbreak of the outbreak, the search for "game" on the Internet has reached an all-time high, and the discussion has focused on key words such as "wild animals," "stay away from game" and "no trading."
目前，在网上已经形成了呼吁大家不要再食用野味的浪潮。
At present, in the Internet has formed a call for people to stop eating game waves.
图 | 制止贩运人口和野生动植物组织的创始人 Steve Galster 表示：新冠病毒是一个大自然的报复，永久性禁令不仅可以挽救人类生命，还可以拯救全球范围内的许多野生动植物。
Steve Galster, founder of the Stop Trafficking in Persons and Wildlife Organization, says the new cap virus is a natural revenge, and that a permanent ban would save not only human lives but also many wildlife around the world.
（来源：Facebook）《野生动物保护法》或在今年进行修订1 月 23 日《新京报》报道称：据九三学社北京市委员会官网消息，中国科学院院士、九三学社社员李景虹与其他几位社员一起组织号召医学界和法律界专家紧急研讨，并特邀民革成员、法律界专家王建平参与，通过九三学社北京市委向九三学社中央提交紧急建议——尽快修改完善立法全面禁止食用野生动物。
Li Jinghong, academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and a member of the Jianxue Society, joined several other members of the society to organize an urgent discussion with medical and legal experts.
目前，该建议已上报至全国政协。
The recommendation has now been reported to the CPPCC.
法律专家王建平认为，在现有法律框架下，交易、运输、制售非重点保护野生动物或其产品，登记注册并获批之后是合规合法的。
Wang Jianping, a legal expert, said it was legal under the existing legal framework to trade, transport, produce and sell non-protected wildlife or their products after registration and approval.
但正是这种“表面上”的合法活动，让这些野生动物成为疾病宿主，构成“动物—动物—人—人”传播疾病的重要根源。
But it is this "ostensible" legal activity that makes these wild animals the hosts of disease, constituting an important source of "animal-animal-human-to-human" disease transmission.
而山水自然保护中心保护主任赵翔则希望，禁止一切野生动物的商业利用。
Zhao Xiang, conservation director at the Nature Conservancy, wants to ban all commercial use of wild animals.
他认为，以盈利为目的，利用野生动物及其产品的饮食业、保健品生产销售、展览表演、标本制售等都应该被逐步禁止，野生动物的药用也值得商榷。
He believes that for profit, the use of wild animals and their products catering, health products production and sales, exhibition performances, specimen production and marketing should be gradually banned, and the medicinal use of wild animals is questionable.
随后在 2 月 10 日，全国人大常委会法工委相关负责人就疫情防控中，社会普遍关心的法律问题进行解答。
Subsequently, on February 10, the relevant officials of the NPC Standing Committee answered legal questions of common concern to society in the prevention and control of the epidemic.
法工委经济法室主任王瑞贺表示，拟将修改野生动物保护法增加列入常委会今年的立法工作计划，并加快动物防疫法等法律的修改进程。
Wang Ruihe, director of the department of economic law, said the proposed amendments to the wildlife law will be added to the Standing Committee's legislative work plan this year, and speed up the revision process of animal epidemic prevention laws and other laws.
王瑞贺指出，野生动物的交易和食用可能造成的公共卫生安全风险已经引起了世界范围内的高度重视。
Wang pointed out that the trade and consumption of wild animals may cause public health security risks has attracted worldwide attention.
为了切实保障人民群众的生命安全和身体健康，各方面普遍要求进一步健全野生动物方面的法律制度，加强执法监督，严厉打击野生动物非法交易，坚决革除滥食野生动物的陋习，加强重大公共卫生安全风险的源头控制。
In order to effectively safeguard people's lives, safety and health, there is a general demand to further improve the wildlife legal system, strengthen law enforcement supervision, crack down on illegal trade in wildlife, resolutely eliminate the abuse of wild animals, and strengthen the source control of major public health security risks.
《野生动物保护法》在 2016 年已经作过一次系统修订，王瑞贺表示，“修改的法律实施后，野生动物的保护状况有所好转。
"Wildlife protection has improved with the implementation of the revised law," Wang said, after a systematic revision of the Wildlife Protection Act in 2016.
但仍有一些问题存在。
However, a number of problems remain.
”具体体现在：首先是相关配套规定没有及时出台；其次，监督检查和执法力度不够，对一些非法野生动物交易市场没有坚决取缔、关闭，甚至在很多地方，野味市场泛滥，相关产业规模很大，构成公共卫生安全的重大隐患。
First, the relevant regulations have not been issued in a timely manner; secondly, insufficient supervision and enforcement; and some markets for the illegal wildlife trade have not been firmly banned or closed, and even in many places there is a proliferation of game markets and related industries on a large scale, posing a major public health concern.
他也解释道，最后一点是因为《野生动物保护法》的立法目的主要是保护珍贵、濒危野生动物，并且采用国际通行的名录保护办法。
He also explained that the final point was that the legislation of the Wildlife Protection Act was primarily aimed at protecting precious and endangered wildlife and that it adopted an internationally accepted list protection scheme.
根据目前的情况来看，有必要进一步补充完善野生动物保护法等相关法律法规，扩大法律调整范围，加大打击和惩治乱捕滥食野生动物行为的力度。
According to the current situation, it is necessary to further supplement and improve wildlife protection laws and regulations, expand the scope of legal adjustments, and intensify efforts to combat and punish wild animals that are caught indiscriminately.
（来自：网络）在 2 月 14 日，天津打响了“野味全面禁令”的第一枪。
On Feb. 14, Tianjin fired the first shots of a "global ban on game."
天津市人大常委会通过了关于禁止食用野生动物的决定，并自公布之日起施行。
The NPCSC of Tianjin adopted the decision on prohibiting the consumption of wild animals, which took effect from the day of promulgation.
决定共 18 条，主要规定了禁止食用野生动物的范围、措施、管理职责和法律责任。
The decision consists of 18 articles, stipulating, inter alia, the scope, measures, managerial responsibilities and legal responsibilities for prohibiting the consumption of wild animals.
对于违规食用野生动物及其制品者，最高可罚其价值 10 倍的罚款。
Violation of the consumption of wildlife and its products is punishable by a fine of up to 10 times its value.
网友们为此纷纷点赞，而天津本地人在表示支持的同时，也说道：天津的饮食风俗里，本身对野味就并不推崇；加之天津市沿海，城区中又有一条大河穿城而过，所以天津人更讲究的是吃“鲜鱼水菜”。
In Tianjin, there is a large river running through the city along the coast of Tianjin, so Tianjin people are more particular about eating fresh fish and vegetables.
他们认为这个决定顺应当前的局势，并希望能起到带头作用，将之推广至全国范围。
They considered the decision to be in line with the current situation and hoped to play a leading role in extending it to the entire country.
当然，倘若有一天禁止野生动物交易的禁令能在全国范围内得到全面施行，地下违法交易势必依然会“屡禁不止”。
Of course, if the ban on wildlife trading were to be enforced across the country one day, the illegal trade would still be "repeatedly banned."
马克思曾说过：“为了 100% 的利润，资本就敢践踏一切人间法律；有 300% 以上的利润，资本就敢犯任何罪行，甚至去冒绞首的危险。
Marx once said: "For 100% of profits, capital dares to trample on all human laws; for more than 300% of profits, capital dares to commit any crime, or even hang.
”所以，禁止野味的关键，一方面在于法律与监管，另一方面则在于对人们饮食观念上的改变——毕竟，没有买卖，就没有杀害。
So the key to banning game is, on the one hand, law and regulation and, on the other hand, a change in people's perception of what to eat - there is, after all, no selling, no killing.
