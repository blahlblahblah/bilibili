近年来，大型自然灾害给日本带来重大影响，日本红十字会也在不断摸索、积累经验，以建立适应需求的运营管理模式。
In recent years, Japan has been greatly affected by large-scale natural disasters, and the Japanese Red Cross Society is constantly groping for and accumulating experience in order to establish a mode of operation and management adapted to the needs.
红十字会也需要“专业化”。
The Red Cross also needs to be "professionalized."

Japan Red Cross Society official network In Japan, the Japanese Red Cross has 48 hours to send a professional medical team and open its collection of donations to disaster victims.
募集到的善款通过第三方全额发放给灾区民众，不收取任何手续费。
Collected charitable funds through a third party to the full distribution to the people in the disaster area, without any handling charges.
在日本红十字会运营管理经验中，我们梳理了十件你可能不太了解的事，帮你了解日本红十字会如何专业运作。
In the management experience of the Japanese Red Cross, we have sorted out ten things you may not know well to help you understand how the Japanese Red Cross operates professionally.
1.日本红十字会也不属于红十字国际委员会。
1. The Japanese Red Cross Society is also not an ICRC.
日本红十字会接受日本厚生劳动省（类似我们理解中的“卫生部”）管理，在法律上，与日本银行、核能损害赔偿・废炉等支援机构等组织一起，都属于基于某种特别法律及政府许可的“认可法人”。
The Japan Red Cross Society accepts the administration of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (similar to what we understand to be the "Ministry of Health") and legally belongs to organizations such as the Bank of Japan and the Support Agency such as the Nuclear Damage Recovery ・, as "authorized legal persons" on the basis of a special law and government permission.
历届名誉总裁均由皇室成员担任，目前名誉总裁是皇后雅子。
Honorary presidents have been members of the royal family and the current Honorary President is Queen Masako.
针对红十字会架构，有很多混乱的理解，网络上所说的“中国红十字会不属于红十字国际委员会”，则是最早对《纽约时报》一篇文章中所述事实的误读，因为没有任何国家的红十字会属于红十字国际委员会。
There was much confusion about the structure of the Red Cross, and the fact that the Chinese Red Cross did not belong to the International Committee of the Red Cross was the first misreading of the facts described in an article in The New York Times, since no national Red Cross Society belonged to the International Committee of the Red Cross.
想要弄清红十字会的组织架构，我们可能要先提及一个概念：“国际红十字与红新月运动”，这是一个国际性的人道主义运动，有三个组成部分，分别是：①红十字国际委员会（International Committee of the Red Cross，简称 ICRC）：一个建立于瑞士的私人人道机构，主要职责是保护武装冲突和其他暴力局势受难者的生命与尊严，并向他们提供援助。
To understand the organization of the Red Cross, we may first mention the concept of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, an international humanitarian movement with three components: the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC): a private humanitarian agency based in Switzerland whose main function is to protect the lives and dignity of victims of armed conflict and other situations of violence and to provide them with assistance.
“国际”并不是成员资格或者组织级别，而是根据《日内瓦公约》界定的它的活动范围。
"International" is not a membership or an organizational level, but rather its sphere of activity as defined by the Geneva Conventions.
它在全球 60 多个国家设有代表处或事务所，在全球约 80 多个国家展开活动。
It has representative offices or offices in more than 60 countries worldwide and is active in some 80 countries worldwide.
红十字国际委员会没有任何“成员国”，与各国红十字会都不存在隶属关系。
ICRC does not have any "member States" and has no affiliation with national Red Cross societies.
②红十字会与红新月会国际联合会（International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies，简称 IFRC）：一个总部设在瑞士的国际人道主义组织，也是全球最大的以志愿者为基础的人道网络。
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC): a Swiss-based international humanitarian organization and the world's largest volunteer-based humanitarian network.
负责协调各国家协会的活动，在灾难和卫生紧急事件发生前、发生时及发生后满足人们的需求并改善脆弱人群的生活。
Responsible for coordinating the activities of national associations to meet people's needs and improve the lives of vulnerable populations before, during and after disasters and health emergencies.
在国际层面上，该联合会与各国家协会密切合作，领导和组织大规模紧急救援。
At the international level, the Federation works closely with national associations to lead and organize large-scale emergency relief.
一般而言，一个国家只有一个国家协会。
Generally, there is only one national association in a country.
中国红十字会与日本红十字会都是红十字会与红新月会国际联合会（IFRC）成员。
Both the Chinese Red Cross and the Japanese Red Cross are members of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).
③各国红十字会与红新月会（这两个组织共同简称为“红会”）：国际红十字与红新月运动的工作和原则通过 192 个国家红会（截至 2019 年 12 月）得到体现。
National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (collectively referred to as "Red Cross"): The work and principles of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement are embodied in 192 national societies (as of December 2019).
国家红会是各国政府在人道领域开展工作的助手，在救灾、卫生和社会等方面提供广泛服务。
The National Societies are auxiliaries to Governments working in the humanitarian field, providing a wide range of services in the areas of disaster relief, health and society.
战乱时期，国家红会会援助受影响的平民、居民，并在适当时侯为军队医疗服务机构提供支持。
During times of war, the National Red Cross Society assists affected civilians, residents and, when appropriate, provides support to military medical services.
2.日本红十字会负责募集善款，但分发靠的是另一个专门机构。
2. The Japan Red Cross Society is responsible for collecting donations, but distribution is done by another specialized agency.
日本受灾时，灾区所在红十字会支部负责募集善款，并通过单独设立的“善款分配委员会”将善款以现金的形式全额（包括银行利息）分发给当地灾民，不收取任何管理费或手续费。
When Japan was hit by the disaster, the Red Cross branch was responsible for collecting the donations and distributing them in cash (including bank interest) to the local victims through a separate "charity distribution committee," with no overhead or handling charges.
“善款分配委员会”制度始于 2011 年东日本大地震。
The charity distribution committee system began with the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011.
当时由于受灾情况复杂，在厚生劳动省的协调下，学界有识之士、灾区政府和包括日本红十字会在内的善款募集团体组成“善款分配决定委员会”，根据受灾严重程度确定善款分发标准。
Due to the complexity of the disaster, under the coordination of the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Labour, scholars, disaster-stricken governments and donation-collecting organizations, including the Japan Red Cross Society, formed a committee to decide on the distribution of donations according to the severity of the disaster.
除了红十字会募集到的善款，其他地方政府、公益组织和媒体机构筹集的善款也被统一交予地方政府，由各个都道府县设立的“善款分配委员会”分发，灾民可凭借相关证明直接领取。
In addition to the donations raised by the Red Cross, donations raised by other local governments, public interest organizations and media organizations have been uniformly handed over to local governments and distributed by the Good Samaritan Allocation Committee set up by each prefecture, who can receive them directly on the basis of relevant certificates.
△ 日本红十字会等组织募集善款后，善款会通过分配委员会全额分发给受灾群众。
After organizations like the Japan Red Cross Society collect donations, the donation will be distributed to the affected people in full through the Distribution Committee.
图片来源 | 日本红十字会官网随着捐款金额的增多，灾民领取的金额也会逐渐增加。
As the value of its donation has increased, so has the amount of money it has received.
截至 2020 年 1 月，熊本地震善款已经分发 43 次。
As of January 2020, 43 donations had been distributed.
对于灾情严重的地区，善款募集可能持续多年。
In severely affected areas, fund-raising may continue for many years.
对日本东北地区的善款募集仍在继续。
Donations to northeastern Japan are continuing.

图片来源 |熊本市社会福祉协议会3. 日本红十字会日常运营不动用灾区善款。
The Japanese Red Cross doesn't use the disaster area's money in its day-to-day operations.
日本红十字会承诺绝不使用捐给灾区的定向善款，其运营成本主要依靠会费与社会捐款，以及各项国家补贴，这些收入被计入“一般会计”种类。
The Japanese Red Cross has pledged never to use targeted donations to the affected areas, and its operating costs are largely based on membership fees and social contributions, as well as State subsidies, which are recorded under the category of "general accounting."
会费是日本红十字会的主要收入来源之一，每年捐款不少于 2000 日元（约合 128 元人民币）即可成为会员。
Membership fees are one of the main sources of income for the Japanese Red Cross, contributing no less than 2,000 yen (128 yuan) a year.
截至 2019 年 3 月 31 日，日本红十字会拥有 14.1 万名个人会员和 7.6 万名法人会员。
As of March 31, 2019, the Japan Red Cross Society has 141,000 individual members and 76,000 corporate members.
△为庆祝 2019 年 5 月“红十字运动月”，日本红十字会在 YouTube 发布了一支募资广告短片，解释日本红十字会的工作，号召人们成为捐赠会员。
To celebrate "Red Cross Movement Month" in May 2019, the Japanese Red Cross Society has launched a short fundraising advertisement on YouTube explaining the work of the Japanese Red Cross and calling for people to become donation members.
2018 年度，日本红十字会的“一般会计”收入总计约 349.7 亿日元（约合 22.4 亿元人民币），全部用于支持日本国内外各种灾害应对费用（包括活动与物资等），以及开展日本国内救援训练、志愿者活动与灾害复兴支援活动，日本红十字会日常运营管理费用也出自这笔收入。
In 2018, Japanese Red Cross Society revenue totaled 34.97 billion yen (2.24 billion yuan), all of which was used to support various disaster response expenses (including activities and materials) inside and outside Japan, as well as rescue training, volunteer activities and disaster recovery support activities in Japan.
△2018 年度日本红十字会收支报告。

Japan Red Cross Society Service Report 2018-2019. The Japanese Red Cross also has three 'special incomes'.
日本红十字会也有医疗设施、血液事业与福利设施经营收入，这些收入被计入“特别会计”。
The Japan Red Cross Society also has income from the operation of medical facilities, blood businesses and welfare facilities, which are recorded as "special accounting."
2018 年度，日本红十字会三项“特别会计”收入超过 1.2 兆日元（约合 769 亿元人民币）。
In 2018, the three "special accountants" of the Japanese Red Cross earned more than 1.2 trillion yen (76.9 billion yuan).
这些收入也专款专用于各事业的运营管理与设备等固定资产投资。
These revenues are also earmarked for investment in fixed assets such as the operation and management of enterprises and equipment.
日本红十字会运营的医院，不仅是日本各地医院系统的重要补充，也是灾害发生时的定点医疗机构。
The hospital operated by the Japanese Red Cross is not only an important supplement to the hospital system throughout Japan, but also a designated medical institution in the event of a disaster.
日本红十字会运营的血液事业，既有为全日本 1 万多所医疗机构供应血液、向 3 家制药公司提供原料血浆的职责，也包含造血干细胞事业的运营管理与新型血液制剂的开发研究工作。
The Japanese Red Cross operates a blood business that supplies blood to more than 10,000 medical institutions throughout Japan, supplies raw blood plasma to three pharmaceutical companies, and also includes the operation and management of hematopoietic stem cell industry and the development of new blood preparations.

医疗救援是日本红十字会的重要职责之一。
Medical rescue is one of the important duties of the Japanese Red Cross.
日本近年台风、地震等灾害频发，由此，他们逐渐建立了各地支部的灾害救援应对机制。
In recent years, typhoons, earthquakes and other disasters have occurred frequently in Japan. As a result, they have gradually established disaster relief and response mechanisms in local branches.
在各地选拔、培训救护员，成立救护团队，截至 2018 年 3 月底，已有常备救护班 489 个，成员 3437 人，登陆救护员 5899 人。
By the end of March 2018, 489 ambulatory rescue teams with 3,437 members and 5,899 ambulance attendants had been set up to select and train ambulance crews in various places.
每个救护班至少包括 1 名医生、3 名看护师和 2 名事务职员，必要时还会增派助产师。
Each ambulance unit consists of at least one doctor, three paramedics and two clerical staff, with additional midwives if necessary.
这些成员大部分来自红十字医院，通过“全国红十字救护班研修班”学习与培训后成为救护员。
Most of these members come from Red Cross hospitals and become ambulance attendants after studying and training in the National Red Cross Ambulance Clinic.
研修班每年举行 4 次，地区支部每年会举行联合救护演习。
The workshops are held four times a year, and joint ambulance drills are held annually by the regional branches.
灾害发生后，救护班主要由灾区附近的红十字医院和当地红十字会支部派出，在当地医疗能力恢复后撤出。
After the disaster, the ambulance service was mainly dispatched by the Red Cross hospital and the local Red Cross branch in the vicinity of the disaster area and evacuated when the local medical capacity was restored.

Japan Red Cross Business Report 2018-2019. Japan's Red Cross Society has introduced a 'emergency response unit' to help emergency victims quickly within 48 hours.
dERU 是临时诊疗所设备与专业医疗队员的总称，也是救护班开展医疗救护的主要场所。
DERU is a temporary clinic equipment and professional medical team members of the general name, but also the ambulance squad to carry out medical care.
每个 dERU 小组载有 188 种医疗器材、65 种药物，还有一些简易储水装置，配备 14 名救护班成员（包括助产士和药剂师）。
Each DERU team carries 188 types of medical equipment, 65 medicines and a number of simple water storage devices with 14 ambulance crew members (including midwives and pharmacists).
医疗物资可保证连续 3 天接诊，每天可接诊 150 名中轻度伤员。
Medical supplies are available for up to three consecutive days and 150 moderately injured persons per day.
截至 2018 年 3 月，全日本共有 20 组 dERU，香川县日常配有 4 组dERU。
As of March 2018, there are 20 groups of DERU in Japan and four ERUs in Xiangchuan County on a daily basis.

The Japanese Red Cross has also acted as a "coordinator" in the rescue effort.
日本红十字会与其他医疗机构保持着密切合作关系，每年都会与政府举行联合救援演习。
The Japanese Red Cross maintains close cooperation with other medical institutions and holds joint rescue drills with the government every year.
其总部和各地支部均设有医疗协调队，由日本红十字会与其他医疗机构共同组成，比如灾害派遣医疗队。
Both its headquarters and branches have medical coordination teams composed of the Japan Red Cross Society and other medical institutions, such as medical teams for disasters.
协调队的主要目的是及时掌握当地医疗需求、地方防灾计划和行政架构，协调当地自治体与医疗团队合作，保证救援活动顺利开展。
The main objective of the coordination team is to provide timely information on local medical needs, local disaster preparedness plans and administrative structures, and to coordinate local self-government efforts with those of the medical team to ensure the smooth conduct of relief activities.
协调队由 1 名医生担任协调人，领导 3 名协调队成员——包括 1 名护士，1 名药剂师和 1 名事务职员。
The team, which is coordinated by a medical doctor, leads three coordination team members -- one nurse, one pharmacist and one clerical staff.
2015 年，日本红十字会与日本海上保安厅签订了灾害合作相关协定，救护班和救援物资可以通过保安厅巡视船与直升飞机迅速运送至灾区。
In 2015, the Japan Red Cross Society signed an agreement on disaster cooperation with the Japan Maritime Safety Agency, whereby ambulances and rescue materials can be transported to the disaster area quickly through patrol boats and helicopters from the Security Agency.
2018 年，红十字会与海上保安厅还实施了物资、伤员运送和应急处理的联合演习。
In 2018, ICRC and the Maritime Security Agency also conducted joint exercises for material, casualty transport and emergency response.
△ 日本北海道胆振东部地震后，首批受日本红十字会派遣的救护班搭乘海上保安厅飞机前往灾区。

图片来源 | 《日本红十字会业务报告（2018-2019）》7. 日本红十字会拥有 92 所医疗设施，采取就近救护原则。
Japan Red Cross Society Service Report 2018 - 2019. The Japanese Red Cross has 92 medical facilities that employ the proximity principle.
日本红十字会拥有的医疗设施中，62 家红十字医院作为公立医院，在各地医疗系统中发挥着核心作用。
Of the medical facilities owned by the Japanese Red Cross, 62 Red Cross hospitals play a central role in the local medical system as public hospitals.
在这些医疗设施中，有 66 所被认证为“灾害定点医院”，34 所为“救命救急中心”，特长为高度专业化的急救与灾害医疗，因此与普通公立医院承担着不同的职责。
Of these facilities, 66 are certified as "disaster referral hospitals" and 34 are "life-saving crisis centres" specializing in highly specialized first aid and disaster medicine, thus assuming different responsibilities from ordinary public hospitals.
庞大的医疗集团确保了“就近救护”的实现，一旦发生紧急灾害，当地红十字医院和地方支部率先组成救护班，由于熟悉当地交通情况与医院分布，可以协助来自全国其他地区的医疗机构展开救护。
The large medical group ensures that "near rescue" is achieved. In the event of an emergency, the local Red Cross hospital and local branch take the lead in setting up rescue teams that can assist medical institutions from other parts of the country because of their familiarity with local traffic and the distribution of hospitals.
2011 年东日本大地震发生后，日本红十字会共派出 894 个救护班约 6500 名急救员，接诊人数超过 7.5 万人，其中位于灾区的宫城县（388 个）和岩手县（345 个）派出的救援班数量最多。
After the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, the Japanese Red Cross sent some 6,500 first aid workers to 894 rescue teams, receiving more than 75,000 people, with Miyagi Prefecture (388) and Iwate Prefecture (345) in the disaster areas having the largest number of rescue classes.

Photo source: Japanese Red Cross Rescue Activities in the Great East Japan Earthquake. The Japanese Red Cross does not accept material donations.
原则上，考虑到物资运送的效率问题，日本红十字会只接收捐款，不接受物资捐赠。
In principle, in view of the efficiency of the delivery of goods, the Japanese Red Cross accepts donations only and not material donations.
日本红十字会也表示，灾害发生后，受灾方的需求在时刻变化，很可能导致捐赠物资派不上用场，造成浪费。
The Japanese Red Cross also said that the changing needs of affected parties in the aftermath of a disaster were likely to result in the diversion of donated goods and waste.
平时，日本红十字总部与各地支部会根据当地人口情况设定物资储备数量。
At ordinary times, the Japanese Red Cross headquarters and local branches will set the quantity of material reserves according to the local population.
灾害发生后，日本红十字会在政府部门协助下将物资运往受灾地，由志愿者团体协助将救援物资分发给有需要的民众。
In the aftermath of the disaster, the Japanese Red Cross, with the assistance of government departments, transported supplies to the affected areas, with the help of volunteer groups to distribute relief supplies to people in need.
如果支部物资不足，可以向其他支部申请物资支援。
If the branch is short of material resources, it may apply to other branches for material support.
红十字会常备救援物资主要有：安眠套装、急救套装、毛毯、塑料床垫、手电筒等基本生活物资。
Red Cross stand-by relief supplies are mainly: sleeping kits, first aid kits, blankets, plastic mattresses, flashlights and other basic necessities.
各支部都需要定期检查和实施操作训练。
Each branch requires regular inspection and implementation of operational training.
截至 2018 年 3 月底，日本红十字会共储备救援物资 2.7806 万套，救护车 665 台。
By the end of March 2018, the Japanese Red Cross had a stockpile of 278.06 million rescue kits and 665 ambulances.
东日本大地震发生后，红十字会从全国地方支部调集物资，共分发了超过 13 万条毛毯、约 3.1 万份急救套装、1.35 万份安眠套装。
In the aftermath of the Great East Japan Earthquake, ICRC mobilized supplies from local branches throughout the country, distributing more than 130,000 blankets, approximately 31,000 first aid kits and 13,500 sleeping kits.
其中半数物资在地震后 5 天内发放完毕。
Half of these supplies were distributed within five days of the earthquake.

The Japanese Red Cross is not a member of its staff.
从 2017 年开始，日本红十字会将“社员”改称为“会员”（日语中，红十字会被称为“赤十字社”），每年捐款 2000 日元（约合 128 元人民币）以上的个人或法人均可成为红十字会会员。
Starting in 2017, the Japanese Red Cross will change the name from "member" to "member" (in Japanese, the Red Cross is referred to as "Red Cross Society"), and any person or person who donates more than 2,000 yen (128 yuan) a year can become a member of the Red Cross.
除了从事相关医疗事业和负责日常运营的雇员外，红十字会目前拥有 14.1 万名个人会员和 7.6 万名法人会员。
The Red Cross currently has 141,000 individual members and 76,000 corporate members, in addition to employees who work in related medical professions and are responsible for day-to-day operations.
非法人会员可享受参加干事与代议员选举、接受业务与收支报告的权利。
Non-corporate members may enjoy the right to participate in the election of officers and deputy councillors, receive business and revenue reports.
会员还可通过代议员向红十字会提出建议。
Members may also make recommendations to the Red Cross through their deputies.
各都道府县会员选出的评议员代表会员选出 223 名代议员，组成红十字会最高决议机构，负责日程决议、预算与规程制定。
Councillors elected by prefectural members elect 223 deputies on behalf of their members to form the supreme resolution body of the Red Cross, responsible for agenda-setting, budgeting and rulemaking.
同时，在总部与支部分别选出监事和监察委员，负责管理、执行与会计监督。
At the same time, supervisors and supervisory committees are elected at headquarters and branches respectively to manage, administer and supervise accounting.

图片来源 | 《日本红十字会业务报告（2018-2019）》日本红十字会就像普通的公司、公务机构一样，每年面向社会招收正式工作人员，充实它的医院、血液运营管理机构、福利设施，以及负责管理、组织培训、国内外各项支援与志愿活动。
The Japanese Red Cross Society, like ordinary companies and civil service organizations, recruits staff every year to strengthen its hospitals, blood management and welfare facilities, as well as its management, training, domestic and international support and volunteer activities.
当然，与很多国家的红十字会一样，志愿者也是支持日本红十字会运作的重要组成部分。
Of course, like many national Red Cross societies, volunteers are an important part of supporting the operations of the Japanese Red Cross.
日本红十字会鼓励人们在地域贡献、活用资格技术、青少年参与等角度，加入不同地区、不同种类的红十字会志愿者组织。
The Japanese Red Cross Society encourages people to join Red Cross volunteer organizations of different regions and types from the perspectives of geographical contribution, living qualification technology and youth participation.
截至 2018 年 3 月，在日本红十字会登记的志愿者接近 122 万名。
As of March 2018, close to 1.22 million volunteers were registered with the Japan Red Cross Society.
10. 日本红十字会也接受第三方监督。
10. The Japanese Red Cross Society is also subject to third-party supervision.
除了会员选出的监事与监察委员，日本红十字会设有内部监察部门，并引入第三方法人作为外部监督。
In addition to the supervisory board and supervisory committee elected by the members, the Japan Red Cross Society has an internal supervision department and introduces a third method person as external supervision.
总部定期派遣监督人员前往各支部与设施，负责指出业务执行问题，并提出建议。
Headquarters regularly sends monitors to branches and facilities to identify operational implementation issues and make recommendations.
外部监督则集中在会计监督角度，比如针对金额庞大的东日本大地震善款，红十字会引入安永新日本会计师事务所（Ernst & Young ShinNihon LLC），由后者遵循国际监查标准展开监督，并每年公布善款募集与分发动向。
External oversight has focused on accounting supervision, such as the introduction of Ernst & amp; Young ShinNihon LLC to the huge East Japan Earthquake, which monitors compliance with international monitoring standards and publishes annual collections and launches.
