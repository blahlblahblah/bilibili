受访者供图著名作家、武汉市文联主席池莉没想到的是，在2020年冬春交际的时节，她写于20多年前的一本小说，突然又多了那么多读者。
What the interviewee didn't expect for the famous writer and chairman of Wuhan Cultural Union Chili was that she wrote a novel more than 20 years ago at the time of winter-spring social intercourse in 2020 and suddenly had so many more readers.
1月29日，一位网友在网上发布了池莉的小说《霍乱之乱》节选版，并称之为“神预测”，因为这是池莉在1997年发表的一部中篇小说。
On January 29, a netizen posted on the Internet an excerpt from Chi Li's novel Cholera Chaos and called it "divine prediction," because it was a novel published by Chi Li in 1997.
在关于这部小说写作记忆中，池莉写道：“这是来自于我个人专业工作经历的小说，我曾经做了三年的流行病防治医生，当我不得不离开卫生防疫专业的时候，我觉得我应该把自己的担忧写成一部小说。
In her memory of the novel, Chi Li wrote: "This is a novel from my personal professional work experience. I worked as an epidemiologist for three years, and when I had to leave health and epidemic prevention, I felt I should turn my worries into a novel.
”自去年12月以来，新冠肺炎疫情席卷全国乃至世界，没有人能置身事外。
Since December, no one has been immune from the outbreak of pneumonia, which has engulfed the country and the world.
身处疫情漩涡中心武汉的池莉，更是尽她所能提醒大家：“传染病的流行可真不是开玩笑的！它不是吃素！”池莉在1月26日写下《给物业与业主的6条建议》，被2月1日出版的《楚天都市报》刊载，这些建议和呼吁后被当地媒体称为“池六条”。
In the center of the epidemic vortex Wuhan Chi Li, but also as she can remind everyone: "The epidemic is not a joke! It is not a vegetarian!" Chi Li wrote on January 26, "To property and owners of the six recommendations," published February 1 by the Chu Tian Metropolis Daily, local media after the recommendations and appeals were called "pool six."
“我是本小区业主之一，学过公共卫生，参加过流行病封锁隔离防治。
"I'm one of the owners of this small district who has studied public health and taken part in epidemic isolation.
鉴于本市疫情还在增长，但不少业主因食品短缺，要去超市买菜，超市不仅人满为患，更可怕的是人与人接触，会造成再次传播与扩散，直接影响您和家人以及他人的生命安全，导致武汉隔离前功尽弃。
Since the epidemic is still growing in this city, many owners are forced to go to supermarkets to buy vegetables because of the shortage of food. Supermarkets are not only overcrowded, but also terrible in terms of human contact, causing retransmission and spread, directly affecting your life and that of your family and others.
”池莉强烈建议，武汉的生活小区采取“直购蔬菜食品套餐，实行无接触配送”。
Chi Li strongly recommends that Wuhan's living quarters adopt the "direct purchase of vegetable food packages, the implementation of contact distribution."
近日，池莉接受澎湃新闻专访时表示，“武汉‘封城’最初，我即开始呼吁隔离。
Recently, Chi Li told the surging news interview, "Wuhan 'closed the city', I began to call for isolation.
因为眼看封住城封不住人，市内依然到处是车流和人群，超市抢购人头涌涌。
The city is still full of traffic and crowds, with supermarkets snapping up buyers as they see the city sealed off.
呼吸道传染病是相当烈性的，如果不能够做到人群的隔离，就无法阻断传播，“封城”也就毫无意义。
Respiratory tract infection is quite strong, if do not achieve crowd isolation, can not block transmission, "closure" is meaningless.
我的呼吁以及关于怎样居家隔离的六条建议，就是基于传染病最基本也是最根本的防治原则。
My appeal and my six recommendations on how to keep people in isolation are based on the most basic and fundamental principles of prevention and treatment of infectious diseases.
”“人类尽可以忽视流行病，但是流行病不会忽视人类，我们欺骗自己是需要付出代价的。
"Humankind can ignore epidemics, but epidemics do not ignore human beings, and we have to pay a price for deceiving ourselves.
”这句写于《霍乱之乱》的题头，在池莉看来，至今仍具有它的意义。
The title, written in Cholera Chaos, still makes sense to Chi Li.
她认为，关于新冠肺炎疫情防控的思考，最重要的问题还是我们必须遵守《传染病防治法》、对这部法律的普及教育以及践行。
She believes that the most important issue in thinking about the prevention and control of new crown pneumonia is that we must abide by the Communicable Disease Prevention Act, provide universal access to the law and implement it.
“对于大众，也是一样，只要知晓传染病防治法，也就不至于这么惊慌失措了。
"For the masses, too, knowing the laws against infectious diseases is not such a panic.
”她说。
'she said.

Chi Li.
受访者供图以下是与池莉的对话“我们最初的反应竟然那么迟钝”澎湃新闻：你是从什么时候开始对新冠肺炎疫情有所了解？什么时候开始感觉到疫情的严重性？池莉：这次疫情，我早有耳闻，差不多去年12月吧，听朋友私下讲的。
When did you first learn about the SARS outbreak? When did you begin to feel the severity of the outbreak? Chi Li: I've heard about this outbreak for a long time, almost last December, and heard it from a friend in private.
当时我心里就一个咯噔：莫不是有某种呼吸道传染病在流行？我年轻时候第一个专业，就是学的公共卫生流行病防治，对传染病流行比较敏感。
Then I thought, Is there some kind of respiratory tract infection prevalent? When I was young, my first major was learning how to control public health epidemics, more sensitive to infectious diseases.
后来有正式信息说无法证实人传人，我就放心了。
I was relieved when there was official information that human-to-human transmission could not be confirmed.
然而随着民间传闻越来越多，传得越来越吓人，有名有姓都很真实，我的心再次提了起来：传染病的流行可不是开玩笑的，它不是吃素的，它是要吃人的！这个时候，我感觉到了疫情的严重性。
But as the rumors grew more and more frightening, and names were real, my heart began again: the epidemic was no joke, it was not vegetarian, it was man-eater!
果然此后不久，武汉突然宣布“封城”。
Sure enough, soon after, Wuhan suddenly announced the "closure."
澎湃新闻：从1月23日武汉“封城”到现在，你的生活和内心产生了怎样的变化？到今天为止，你出门了吗？池莉：“封城”对我来说，并不太意外。
How has your life and heart changed since the city was closed on January 23 in Wuhan? So far, have you been out of the house?
一开始心情比较纠紧，一旦“封城”，我的心反而放下来了。
At the beginning of the mood is more tight, once the "closure", my heart instead down.
我家的隔离，做得比“封城”更早。
The isolation of my family was done earlier than the closure of the city.
反正传染病这个东西，你宁可信其有，不可信其无，早做准备，有备无患。
Anyway, infectious disease this thing, you prefer trusted it, do not trust its absence, early preparation, prepared.
本来春节假日我是要出门，高铁票早就买好了，我们果断退了票，立刻就近购买食品蔬菜，塞满冰箱，总归按一般14天隔离期的量在储备粮食。
Originally I was going to go out spring holiday, high-speed rail tickets have been bought, we resolutely returned the ticket, immediately nearby to buy food and vegetables, stuffed with refrigerators, always at the normal 14-day isolation in the amount of grain.
我再也不去人群聚集的地方。
I'm not going to go anywhere with crowds anymore.
我还提醒和警告了同事。
I also alerted and warned my colleagues.
到今天为止，我基本都在居家隔离，没有紧要事情不出门，如果是必须出门，会首先做好防护。
So far, I have been basically isolated at home, no urgent things do not go out, if it is necessary to go out, will be the first to do a good job.
澎湃新闻：你曾经呼吁多日的要采取切实隔离措施与行动到社区，当时是基于怎样的考虑？到目前为止，对疫情实施的种种措施中，给你印象最深刻的是哪一个，为什么？池莉：武汉“封城”最初，我即开始呼吁隔离。
Pound News: What was the basis of your call for days of effective isolation and action in the community? Which of the measures implemented so far for the epidemic has impressed you the most and why?
因为眼看封住城、封不住人，市内依然到处是车流和人群，超市抢购人头涌涌。
The city was still full of traffic and crowds, and supermarkets were rushing to buy people, as the city was closed and sealed.
呼吸道传染病是相当烈性的，如果不能够做到人群的隔离，就无法阻断传播，“封城”也就毫无意义。
Respiratory tract infection is quite strong, if do not achieve crowd isolation, can not block transmission, "closure" is meaningless.
我的呼吁以及关于怎样居家隔离的六条建议，就是被媒体朋友们开玩笑说的“池六条”，就是基于传染病最基本也是最根本的防治原则。
My appeal, along with six tips on how to keep people in their homes, is based on the most basic and fundamental principle of prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, as jokingly described by media friends.
如果一定要说这次有什么印象最深，就是震惊于我们最初的反应竟然那么迟钝。
What impressed me most this time was how insensitive our initial reaction was.
瘟疫就是洪水猛兽，这个认识普通老百姓可以没有，我们专业公共卫生系统万万不可以没有。
Plague is a monster, this understanding of ordinary people can not, our professional public health system must not be not.
因为一旦迟钝，直接就是生命财产的巨大损失。
Because once dull, direct is the huge loss of life and property.
澎湃新闻：面对此次疫情，武汉人的精神发生了变化吗？或者，武汉人也需要改变一些什么？池莉：疫情吞噬的是一个个具体的生命，我作为作家塑造书写的，也是一个个具体个人，其实并不存在一个抽象的“武汉人”，因此也就无从说起抽象的武汉人需要改变什么。
In the face of this epidemic, Wuhan people's spirit has changed? Or, what do Wuhan people need to change? Chi Li: The epidemic swallowed up specific life, I as a writer writing, is also a specific individual, in fact, there is no abstract "Wuhan", so there is no way to talk about what the abstract Wuhan people need to change.
而对于每一个具体的武汉人来说，我相信，经历这一场瘟疫，精神状态一定是有变化的。
And for every specific Wuhan people, I believe that the experience of this plague, the state of mind must be changed.
从文学作品来讲，以后的作品也肯定会有反映。
From the literary works, the later works will certainly reflect.
只是文学没有那么简单直白，更不似网民在网络上传的那种脸谱化。
But the literature is not so simple and straightforward, not to mention the Internet users upload that kind of face.
“人类最好学会与万物和谐相处”澎湃新闻：你曾经是一名基层流行病医生，这段学习和工作的经历对你面对此次疫情来说，有哪些影响？池莉：一个人年轻时候学习的专业，往往是终身的影响，包括思维方式和生活习惯等等各方面。
"Humans had better learn to live in harmony with all things," roar news: You were a grass-roots epidemiologist, how did your experience of learning and working affect you in the face of the epidemic? Chi Li: The major a person learns as a young person is often a lifelong influence, including thinking and living habits.
面对这次疫情，我直接就是流行病防治的专业思维。
In the face of this epidemic, I am directly the professional thinking of epidemic prevention and treatment.
澎湃新闻：目前第七版诊疗方案已经发布，你认为我们对新冠病毒的了解完整了吗，还存在哪些问题需要解答，应以何种方式让公众知晓？池莉：当然不能够说完整。
You think our knowledge of the new crown virus is complete, what questions need to be answered, and how should the public know about it?
这是诊疗方案，是临床的，是医治这个新型疾病的阶段性摸索。
This is the diagnosis and treatment plan, is the clinical, is treats this new kind of disease stage grope.
更重要的是流行病学的追踪与阻断，应该与临床齐头并进乃至更超前，才算真正的防控。
More importantly, the epidemiological tracking and blocking, should go hand in hand with the clinical or even more advanced, is a true control.
比如说，如果已经有足够的临床对照数据，发现了新冠病毒具有粪尿——口传播，那么就需要立刻进行粪道粪池的大排查，尽早尽快疏通与密封。
If, for example, enough clinical control data are available to show that the new cap virus has fecal urine-oral transmission, a major STS scan is needed immediately to unclog and seal it as soon as possible.
这又是一项宏大与艰巨的工作，但从阻断传播途径来说，也是必须的。
This is an ambitious and difficult task, but it is also necessary to interrupt transmission routes.
至于公众的知晓度，信息越透明、越广泛、知识越普及就越好，大家才知道自己应该怎么做。
As for public awareness, the more transparent and widespread the information, and the better the knowledge, the better it will be before everyone knows what to do with it.
澎湃新闻：面对一种新发的传染病，需要怎样的常态化机制去面对，才能最大限度防止疫情蔓延？池莉：常态化机制其实有的，世界各国都有。
Pound News: What kind of normalized mechanism is needed to deal with a newly emerging infectious disease in order to prevent the spread of the epidemic to the greatest extent?
很多国家的公共卫生体系的投资、研究与装备，都超过临床医学。
Public health systems in many countries invest, research and equip more than clinical medicine.
我国就有《传染病防治法》，法律规定传染病是每天都必须报疫情卡的。
In our country, there is the Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, which stipulates that epidemic cards must be reported every day.
你想想，单独就传染病规定了一部严谨的法律，难道还不是常态化吗？如果不忽略，如果依法办事，疫情就可能被限制在很小范围解决问题。
Don't you think it's normal to have a strict law on infectious diseases alone? If you don't ignore it, if you follow the law, the epidemic could be limited to a small area.
澎湃新闻：“人类尽可以忽视流行病，但是流行病不会忽视人类，我们欺骗自己是需要付出代价的。
surging news: "Man can ignore epidemics, but epidemics do not ignore human beings. We have to pay a price for deceiving ourselves."
”你现在重看这句话，有哪些新的思考和认识？池莉：新的思考和认识是我突然发现：我的这句话依然继续管用。
What new reflections and understandings do you have when you re-read this sentence? Phil: The new thinking and awareness is that I suddenly realized that this sentence still holds true.
澎湃新闻：怎么理解“消灭”传染病？当无法真正“消灭”时，在与自然共处过程中，人类如何与潜在的危机的共处？池莉：我在小说《霍乱之乱》当中已经写了：消灭只是暂时的阻断和终止。
How to understand the "extermination" of infectious diseases? How do humans coexist with potential crises when they can't really "eliminate" and coexist with nature? Chi Li: I wrote in my novel Cholera Chaos: Extinction is only a temporary interruption and termination.
人类并不是独享这个地球，是与万物共生在。
Man does not live alone on this earth, but in coexistence with all things.
食物链是一个环状结构，谁吃谁并不是以体积排序，而是弱肉强食，病毒细菌有时候就是比人类强大。
The food chain is a circular structure, and whoever eats is not ordered by volume, but by the predatory, viral bacteria that are sometimes stronger than humans.
所以人类最好学会与万物和谐相处，从尊重开始。
So it is best for humans to learn to live in harmony with all things, starting with respect.
澎湃新闻：在自然教育与人文教育方面，可以作出哪些思考？未来如何加强公共卫生领域常识的传播？像武汉这样的特大城市，如何去处理疫情这样的公共危机？池莉：这次值得思考的问题太多了。
What can be done about nature education and humanistic education? How to strengthen the dissemination of common sense in the field of public health in the future? How can a mega-city like Wuhan deal with a public crisis like this one?
最重要的还是遵守法律、普及法律以及践行法律，按照《传染病防治法》去做。
The most important thing is to abide by the law, popularize the law and practice it, in accordance with the Communicable Diseases Act.
对于大众，也是一样，只要知晓传染病防治法，也就不至于这么惊慌失措了。
The same is true for the general public, as long as they are aware of infectious disease prevention and treatment law, they do not panic so much.
“希望浴火重生之后，不再重蹈覆辙”澎湃新闻：疫情过后，你会对这场疫情进行写作吗？你认为灾难文学最大的意义是什么？池莉：文学是一种审美或者审丑的艺术，永远不是一个直接的表达，直接表达是新闻的功能。
What do you think is the greatest significance of disaster literature? Chi Li: Literature is an aesthetic or aesthetic art, never a direct expression, and direct expression is the function of news.
文学写作当然会涵盖与切入社会事件。
Literary writing will, of course, cover social events.
而文学的意义在于，文学总是无为而治，总是见仁见智，总是说大就大，说小就小，这要看对象是谁。
The significance of literature is that literature is always no rule, always see eye to eye, always say big, say small, depending on who is the object.
对阅读的人有意义，对不阅读的人无意义；对产生共鸣的人有极大意义，对无法共鸣的人则无更大意义。
Meaning to the reader, meaningless to the non-reader, of great significance to the sympathetic, and of no greater significance to the unsympathetic.
澎湃新闻：一场灾难过后，最应留下来的文字记录是哪些内容？后灾难的心理重建，如何用文字的力量及其他手段去抚慰人心？池莉：这个不是我认为的问题。
Pound News: After a disaster, what is the most important written record? Post-disaster psychological reconstruction, how to use the power of words and other means to soothe people? Chi Li: This is not what I think.
一些文学作品与文字能够留下来，能够抚慰人们心灵，是客观发生的，不是作家自己可以预估的。
Some literary works and writings can be left to soothe people's hearts and minds. They happen objectively and not in a way that the writer can predict.
比如我就完全没有想到，我写于1997年的《霍乱之乱》，突然在今天又会有那么多读者。
It never occurred to me, for example, that Cholera Chaos, which I wrote in 1997, would suddenly have so many readers today.
作家只要练好内功，用心写作就好。
A writer only needs to practice his internal skills and write hard.
澎湃新闻：我们在这场疫情中看到了悲欢离合，与生命的逝去与新生，武汉人固有的面貌和情绪会在疫情后有所改变吗？它会影响你对武汉人的创作吗？文字或者文学作品应如何记录和书写生命的价值？池莉：疫情还没有结束，所有判断都为时过早。
Pai Pai News: We have seen in this epidemic, with the death and renewal of life, Wuhan inherent appearance and mood will change after the epidemic it will affect your creation to Wuhan? Writing or literary works should record and write the value of life? Chi Li: The epidemic is not over, all judgments are premature.
但是有一点，人类又不是第一次遭遇灾难。
But it is not the first time that mankind has suffered a disaster.
人类就是从灾难中走过来的。
It is from disaster that mankind has come.
尤其是我们中华民族，是一个灾难深重、多灾多难的民族。
We Chinese, in particular, are a disaster-ridden and disaster-ridden people.
这个故事，是一个古老又被反复刷新的故事，我的写作，自然也会受到影响而反复刷新。
This story, is an old and has been refreshed over and over again, my writing, will naturally be affected and refreshed.
我之所以不断写作其价值就在于：希望在一茬茬的生命过程中，我们能够长点记性，能够在浴火重生之后，不再重蹈覆辙。
The value of my constant writing lies in the hope that, over the course of a stubble of life, we will be able to remember things long enough not to repeat them.
