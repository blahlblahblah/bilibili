作者：张霞来源：商业人物（ID：biz-leaders）壹2月17日下午，也就是昨天，我所在的村庄爆发了自疫情以来最大的一次恐慌。
Author: Zhang Xia Source: ID: biz-leaders February 17, the afternoon of yesterday, my village has broken out since the outbreak of the largest panic.
恐慌的迹象由村头的小卖部显现。
Signs of panic appeared in the village canteen.
傍晚六点钟左右，我陪妈妈购买面粉时，小卖部的主人告诉我们，没有50斤的大袋面粉了。
At about six o'clock in the evening, when I was shopping for flour with my mother, the owner of the refreshment shop told us that there was no longer 50 kilos of flour.
“不知是咋地了，刚才好几个人推着小推车，四五袋的买。
"I don't know how, just now several people pushed the trolley, four or five bags to buy.
”她嘀咕道。
'she murmured.
疑惑在晚上8点20左右得到了解答，我的亲友群以及同学开始流传：我们县出现第一例新冠肺炎确诊者了！一张显示是由县人民医院流传来出的照片，和一段其所在村庄已经彻底“封村“的视频被四处转发。
Doubts were answered around 8: 20 p. m., and my friends, relatives and classmates began to circulate: the first confirmed case of New Crown Pneumonia in our county! A photo showing pictures from the county People's Hospital and a video of the village being "sealed off" were distributed everywhere.
图片显示，这一患者16:05分入院，40分钟后被确诊，27天前（1月21日）曾与新冠肺炎患者有过接触。
The patient was admitted to hospital at 16: 05, was diagnosed 40 minutes later and had contact with patients with pneumonia 27 days ago (January 21).
昨天晚上8：20左右，我县出现新冠肺炎确诊病例的消息，开始在亲友间和微信群流传这一传说中的确诊者所在的村庄，和我们村相距不过十几公里。
At about 8: 20 last night, news of confirmed cases of New Crown Pneumonia began to circulate among friends, relatives and micro-groups that the village where the purported diagnosed was located was no more than a dozen kilometers away from our village.
年前村民间的互相往来肯定是有的。
There must have been people-to-people exchanges in the village before.
而微信群中，他的接触树状图也显示，27天内他曾去过县城，和村内的村民多次接触，并在大年初二前，去过外村走动。
In the micro-letter group, his contact tree also showed that he had visited the county town in 27 days, made many contacts with the villagers in the village, and had been outside the village before the second day of the New Year.
虽然是隔着网络，也已经感受到恐惧来袭了。
Even through the Internet, I feel fear coming.
群里，不少人忆起，自己曾去过他所出没过的县城超市。
In the group, many people remember that they had been to the county supermarkets where he haunted.
甚至有人开始忧心起县医院的医疗水平，评估其到底能容纳多少病人。
Some even began to worry about the standard of care at Kishi County Hospital, assessing how many patients it could hold.
我会过日子的妈妈，更是提前担心起一旦整个县城被封，蔬菜、肉类和粮食会不会涨价。
I will live the mother, but also worried in advance that once the entire county will be sealed, vegetables, meat and grain prices will not rise.
不顾天黑，妈妈又跑了一趟小卖部，买来了一箱牛奶和几斤鸡蛋。
Despite the darkness, my mother went to the grocery store and bought a case of milk and a few pounds of eggs.
而我们村一对在元宵节过后，由河南婆家返回的母子，也成为迁怒对象。
Our village in the Lantern Festival after the return of mother-in-law from Henan, also became the object of anger.
“都怨外来的。
"" It's all foreign.
要不是外来的，我们村得多好，多平安？”妈妈向我转述，小卖部里抢购的人，正在抱怨。
How nice and safe our village would have been had it not been for the foreigners? "Mother relayed to me that the snapping-up people at the commissary were complaining.
外地才会有病毒，是他们固有的认知。
It is their inherent knowledge that viruses are present in the field.
贰在村医宋恒让的记忆里，上一次，整个村庄都对外来者如此恐慌，是在非典时期了。
Second, in the village doctor's memory, the last time, the entire village is so frightened of outsiders, is in the SARS period.
宋恒让今年73岁，是村里目前年纪最大的村医，直到13年前才退休，有40年的行医史。
Mr. Song, 73, the village's oldest village doctor, didn't retire until 13 years ago, 40 years after practicing medicine.
疫情期间，已退休的宋恒让在卫生室辅助儿子检测村民健康状况据他回忆，当时，我所在的村庄也是异常紧张的。
During the outbreak, retired Song Heng-Jean assisted his son in a health clinic to check on the health of villagers. My village, he recalls, was also very tense.
当时，曾有谣传在村里蔓延，“那个病，只要得上基本就没法治了”。
At that time, there were rumors spread in the village, "the disease, as long as the basic no rule of law."
每天早晚宋恒让和村领导都背着喷雾器，在村的各个角落里喷射消毒液。
Soong Heng Jean and the village leader each morning and evening sprayed disinfectant in every corner of the village with sprayers on their backs.
消毒水是镇政府提供的，需定期检查。
Disinfectant water is provided by the town government and needs to be checked regularly.
村里有三个村民是由北京返回的，都被迅速的隔离了起来。
Three villagers from the village had returned from Beijing and were quickly quarantined.
宋恒让一天需要为他们量三次体温，然后统计上报。
Song Heng asked them to take their temperature three times a day and report it to the police.
即便如此，这三个村民也是整个村庄战战兢兢的所在。
Even so, the three villagers were the trepidation of the entire village.
宋恒让玩笑说，“当时就连他们的家所在胡同，很多人也都绕着走”。
"Even their home in the Hutong, many people also walked around," Song said jokingly.
其中有一个隔离者，耐受不住了，一度向他抱怨，“这是把我当什么了？老鼠吗？”但据他多年的观察，严重的流行性疾病对村庄造成的损害并不大。
One of the isolators, unable to bear it, once complained to him, "What do you think of me? Mouse?" But he had observed for years that serious epidemic diseases did not do much damage to the village.
从医之后，他印象最深的一个流行病防治任务，是给村民接种天花疫苗。
After medical treatment, one of his most impressive epidemiological missions was to vaccinate villagers against smallpox.
公开资料记载，新中国成立初期，天花仍旧是我国死亡率最高的急性传染病之一。
In the early days of New China, smallpox remained one of the most deadly acute infectious diseases in China.
1952年，卫生部发出种痘指示，预定当年种痘二亿六千万人。
In 1952, the Ministry of Health issued vaccination instructions, scheduled to vaccinate 260 million people that year.
1966年，世界卫生组织提出各国加强合作，提高疫苗接种密度，根除全球天花流行的倡议。
In 1966, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched an initiative to strengthen cooperation among countries to increase vaccination density and eradicate the global smallpox epidemic.
宋恒让是1967年接受了县医院的统一培训后，开始行医的。
Song Heng-Jean started practicing medicine after receiving unified training from county hospital in 1967.
在乡村任务性的推行天花接种，或许跟世卫组织的这个倡议有关。
The introduction of smallpox vaccination at the village level may be linked to this WHO initiative.
在他的记忆里，当时要求，不论大人小孩， 但凡没有接种史的，都要接种。
In his memory, he demanded that all children, adults and children alike, who had not been vaccinated, should be vaccinated.
所幸的是，我们村并没有天花的历史，感染水痘的居多。
Fortunately, our village does not have smallpox history, the majority of people infected with chicken pox.
村里便有几个五六十岁的人，因为小时候抓挠水痘留下了疤痕，被称为“王大麻子”“刘大麻子”。
In the village there are a few 50-60-year-old people, as a child scratched chicken pox left scars, known as "Wang Pockmarked" "Liu".
另外一个曾夺取了无数婴儿性命的疾病“七日风”，大约也是在1967年左右被消灭。
Another disease that claimed the lives of countless babies, the Seven Days Wind, was also destroyed around 1967.
这得益于当时对乡村接生员的统一培训。
This was made possible by the unified training of village midwives at that time.
我今年82岁的奶奶，是当时村里推荐上去的，和宋恒让一起在县医院受训过“同学”。
My 82-year-old grandmother, was recommended by the village at that time, and Song Heng-let together in the county hospital training "classmate."
奶奶作为接生员时的行医工具根据宋恒让和奶奶讲述，“七天风”应该就是破伤风，指小孩出生后，出现抽搐、哭喊不停、发烧等症状，一般七天内便死了。
According to Song Heng-Jean and his grandmother, "seven days of wind" means tetanus, a condition in which a child develops convulsions, cries, and a fever, and then dies within seven days.
主要原因应该是，乡村产婆大都没有专业的医学知识，剪脐带的剪刀是家用剪刀，用白酒擦拭一下，也就算是消毒了。
The main reason should be that most rural midwives do not have professional medical knowledge, the scissors cut umbilical cord is household scissors, with white wine wipe, even if it is disinfected.
容易感染和受风。
Vulnerable to infection and wind.
成为村里的接生员后，镇卫生所定期提供给奶奶纱布、绷带、医用酒精、消毒水等物，产钳、镊子、剪刀也是医院配备，由此开始，“七天风”这种疾病在村庄里消失了。
As village midwives, barangay clinics regularly provide granny gauze, bandages, medical alcohol, disinfectant, etc., forceps, tweezers, scissors, and so on. The "seven-day wind" disease disappeared from the village.
叁天花和破伤风之外，被当作任务消除的还有血吸虫病和麻风病。
In addition to three days of flowers and tetanus, schistosomiasis and leprosy were eliminated as tasks.
史料里能够查询到的，《国务院关于消灭血吸虫病的指示》文件是在1957年发出，那时宋恒让才十岁。
The State Council Directive on the Eradication of Schistosomiasis was issued in 1957, when Mr. Song was only 10 years old, as can be found in the historical sources.
他有印象的是1970年左右，他负责采集过村民的血样，每晚拿着一些玻璃片，挨家挨户去给睡着的小孩和大人在耳垂上扎上那么一针，再将血样标注好名字，交给乡卫生所的人化验。
He had the impression that around 1970 he was responsible for collecting blood samples from villagers, carrying glass every night, going from house to house to give sleeping children and adults a needle in their ear lobe, then marking the blood samples and sending them to the commune health centre for testing.
麻风病所要引起的恐惧则要大的多。
The fear of leprosy is much greater.
许是会造成皮肤异样和肢端残疾的缘故，患者在村里很受避讳。
It is likely to cause skin abnormalities and acromegaly disability, and the patient is very much taboo in the village.
我们村有三个病例， 据宋恒让和村里的老人讲，其中一个因为病症特别严重，一直被隔离在山顶的小屋，直到去世也没有成婚。
There were three cases in our village, one of which, according to Song Heng-Jean and the village elder, had been isolated in a hut on the top of a hill because of a particularly serious illness.
村里为他盖了石头屋，打了水井，定期有人负责送上粮食，不允许他下山取水。
The village built stone houses for him, drilled wells, was regularly given food and was not allowed to go down the mountain to collect water.
“大麻风”来了，甚至是大人对小孩的恐吓之语，对这种疾病的误解可见一斑。
"Leprosy" came, even adults to the child's intimidating words, this disease can be seen in the misunderstanding.
宋恒让的儿子宋连宁是村里的第二代村医，19岁跟着父亲行医。
Song Heng Jean's son Song Lianning is the village's second generation village doctor, 19 years old followed his father practice medicine.
按他的描述，对乡民危害最大的其实是卫生健康习惯。
According to his description, the most harmful to rural residents is actually the health habits.
比如疖子、虱病、疥疮、湿疹、荨麻疹等。
Such as boils, lice, scabies, eczema, urticaria and so on.
他1997年跟父亲行医的时候，这些因不太注意更换被褥或者洗澡，而患上的皮肤类疾病，还时常发生。
When he practiced medicine with his father in 1997, these skin diseases often occurred because he paid little attention to changing bedding or bathing.
据他讲述，虱子和跳蚤曾在村里横行。
According to him, lice and fleas had infested the village.
蛔虫病很长一段时间，也困扰乡村的孩子，这也大多也跟喜欢挖泥巴、挖沙子，却没有洗手的卫生习惯有关。
Ascaris disease has long been a problem for children in the countryside, and most of it has to do with the habit of digging for dirt and sand but not washing their hands.
再则就是腮腺炎，农村叫做“痄腮”，往往班里一个孩子得了，很快就病倒一半，还有“红眼病”，也就是沙眼。
Another is mumps, or mumps, in the countryside, where a child often gets mumps and soon falls ill in half, as well as "red eye disease," or trachoma.
村里出过的最严重的一种病，其实是“出血热”。
One of the most serious illnesses ever seen in the village was "haemorrhagic fever."
这主要跟村里野鼠和家鼠横行有关。
This is mainly related to the village rats and rats rampant.
我所在的村庄很长一段时间是和猫头鹰、老鼠、黄鼠狼、蝙蝠等各种动物共存的，村里不少泥肧房。
For a long time my village lived with owls, mice, weasels, bats and many other kinds of animals.
摊煎饼或者放柴火的柴房里遇见老鼠并不罕见。
It is not uncommon to meet mice in pancakes or firewood rooms.
肉菜或者粮食被老鼠咬过，时有发生，人吃下后容易感染出血热。
Meat or grain has been bitten by rats, sometimes, people eat after easy to infect hemorrhagic fever.
我们村患者这种疾病的不下十个。
There are no fewer than ten sufferers from this disease in our village.
镇中学里，也有爆出过这种疾病。
The disease also popped up in the town's high school.
肆至于对目前的新冠肺炎的防控，作为村医，宋恒让和宋连宁所感受的到是：村民先是有些意识松懈，而后又太过恐慌。
As for the prevention and control of the new crown pneumonia, as village doctors, Song Heng-Jean and Song Lianning felt that the villagers were at first somewhat relaxed and then too frightened.
疫情期间，基层医院防控极严，村卫生所需每天记录消毒情况许是非典期间，整个县内都没有确诊患者缘故，新冠肺炎疫情刚刚蔓延之际，村民大多是不够警惕。
During the epidemic period, the grass-roots hospital control extremely strict, village health needs daily record disinfection situation is likely to be SARS period, the whole county has not diagnosed the patient, the new crown pneumonia outbreak just spread, villagers are mostly not vigilant.
“这种病，怎么会传到我们这里？”是他们惯说的话语。
"How did the disease spread to us?" was their oft-repeated word.
他们认为，这种由大城市蔓延的疾病如果能够到了乡村，那恐怕就是无所幸免了。
They believe that the spread of the disease from the big cities if it can reach the countryside, it is probably not spared.
有几分自己是战场最后方的侥幸。
He was in part a fluke to the last side of the field.
在宋恒让父子那里，这种放松有另一重解读——乡村里挨过的病痛和死亡实在太多了。
In Song Heng let the father and son, this relaxation has another interpretation - the country has suffered too much pain and death.
意外随时发生，我们村曾有人爬在核桃树上打核桃，不下心摔了下来，后脑勺正好磕在石头上，不到半小时也就过世了；因为常年种植果树，一年要打十来遍农药，最近几年患肺癌的颇多，有一些去医院化疗了，有的也就静待着死亡了，还有人为了不给家里造成负担喝农药自杀了；有患了乳腺癌的妇女，因耽误了治疗，在家生吃蟾蜍和壁虎。
There were men in our village who climbed on a walnut tree and knocked a walnut out of the tree, knocked on the back of the head and died less than half an hour later; some got lung cancer in recent years, some went to hospital for chemotherapy or died of pesticide.
县城对他们就是一个很大的世界了，更遥不可及的世界里的疫情，发生在自己头上的机率，或许并不比从核桃树上摔下更高。
The county is a big world for them, and an epidemic in a more distant world may not be more likely to happen to them than to fall off a walnut tree.
但因为信息闭塞而蔓延的恐慌，也会爆发力十足。
But the panic that spreads because of the closeness of information can also be explosive.
对村里那对河南返回的母子的态度，便是一个例证。
A case in point was the attitude towards the village mother and son who had returned from Henan.
从元宵节她们返村过后，整个村庄的神经似乎有些紧绷起来。
After their return from the Lantern Festival, the nerves in the whole village seemed to be tense.
村里的猪肉和面粉也被抢购了不少，因为谣传就要彻底“封村”了。
Pork and flour were also snapped up in the village as rumors spread that the village would be completely closed.
昨天晚上的面粉抢购事件，也是一个例子——今天一早，最终村里又传来消息，一切只是一个乌龙。
The flour raid last night was another case in point -- early this morning, news finally came from the village that everything was just an oolong.
据说是误诊，那人只是确诊患者的接触者，县医院太紧张了，市里检测后不是。
It is said to be a misdiagnosis, the person is only the contact of the confirmed patient, county hospital is too nervous, the city after the test is not.
警报一解除，到了上午村民又开始上山干活了。
As soon as the alarm was lifted, the villagers began to work up the hill again in the morning.
除了疫情，他们还担心五月份的樱桃。
In addition to the outbreak, they worry about cherries in May.
不过在地里，村民也都戴上了口罩——同样是因为消息闭塞所带来的恐惧，按他们零零散散、以讹传讹的信息判断：这病只要得了，县里是治不了的。
But in the fields, the villagers also wore masks - again because of the fear of being ill-informed, judging by their scattered, false information that the disease was incurable in the county.
