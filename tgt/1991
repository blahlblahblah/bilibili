作者 | 苏琦编辑 | 魏佳“金三银四”的春招季，如今变成了一场薛定谔的招聘季。
At the start of its spring season, Wei Jia turned into a recruitment season for Schrodinger.
疫情冲击之下，对于企业来说，解决“人”的问题和“钱”的问题同样紧迫。
Addressing "people" and "money" issues is just as urgent for businesses under the impact of the epidemic.
根据调查，30.4%的企业表示将会减员缩编，还有29.68%无法为员工按时发放薪资。
According to the survey, 30.4 per cent of businesses said they would downsize and 29.68 per cent were unable to pay their employees on time.
复工首周的招聘职位数量同比下降71.66%，缩减严重。
The number of job openings in the first week of resumption fell by 71.66 per cent year on year.
本该“一年之季在于春”的春招季，被疫情按下暂停键，现在大约有17%的人宁愿拿着基本工资也不敢贸然跳槽。
About 17 percent of the population would rather be on a basic salary than jump on the bandwagon during the spring season, when the epidemic hit the pause.
有HR告诉燃财经，自己大年初二就收到了求职简历，隔着屏幕都能感受到求职者的急迫，但疫情发生后，公司招聘计划停止，连原来年前定好的口头offer都被取消。
HR told Flaming Finance that he received a job resume on the second day of the New Year, across the screen can feel the urgency of job seekers, but after the outbreak of the epidemic, the company recruitment plan stopped, even the original scheduled oral offer was cancelled.
正在招人的企业也没有觉得轻松，因为简历投递数量同比减少了83.35%，且有些求职者抗拒线上面试的方式，希望等到复工之后再做当面的沟通，无形之中面试流程被拖长。
Companies hiring aren't feeling comfortable either, with resumes down 83.35% year-on-year, and some job seekers resisting online interviews, hoping to wait until they get back to work to do face-to-face communication, prolonging the interview process.
另外，现在很多学校还没有定具体的开学时间，实习生岗位也难招到合适的人。
In addition, many schools have not set a specific time to start school, interns also find it difficult to find the right person.
当然，疫情来临也是有人欢喜有人忧。
Of course, there are some people who are happy and worried about the outbreak.
物流、医疗健康与教育培训行业“逆风而上”，招聘需求上升。
Logistics, health and education and training industry "against the wind", recruitment demand rose.
一些提供视频面试工具的企业也迎来用户数量激增，技术实力、服务质量、精细化运营等方面成为其未来发展的重要考验因素。
Some enterprises provide video interview tools also ushered in a sharp increase in the number of users, technical strength, service quality, fine operation and other aspects of its future development has become an important test factor.
复工第一周招聘职位数量下降七成“大年初二那天，我就收到了求职者发来的简历。
I received a resume from the applicant on the second day of New Year's Day.
当时我意识到，今年招聘市场的形势会很严峻，求职者很急迫。
I realized at the time that the recruiting market was going to be tough this year and job seekers were in a hurry.
”北京一家公司的HR王佳告诉燃财经。
HR Wang Jia, a Beijing-based company, told Flaming Finance.
按照原计划，王佳所在的公司在节后将招聘十名员工，她原本已经和一些求职者约好节后面试，但疫情发生以后，公司决定暂停招聘，连一些有过口头意向的候选人也被卡住无法入职。
Ms. Wang, whose company is expected to hire 10 employees after the holiday, had arranged post-holiday interviews with some applicants, but the company decided to suspend hiring after the outbreak, and even some candidates who had made verbal offers were stuck.
疫情之下，保证现金流成为企业的第一要务，停止招聘则成为老板们的第一步。
Under the epidemic, ensuring cash flow becomes the number one priority for companies, and stopping hiring is the first step for bosses.
这也反映在数据上，根据智联招聘的调查，30.4%的企业表示将会减员缩编，还有29.68%无法为员工按时发放薪资，无影响的企业仅占17.81%。
This is also reflected in the data, according to a survey conducted by the Chile Consortium, according to which 30.4 per cent of enterprises indicated that they would downsize, 29.68 per cent were unable to pay their employees on time and 17.81 per cent were not affected.
另外，惨淡经营下，降薪、合同违约风险、裁员也成为企业不得不面对的问题，10.64%的受访企业面临着破产或倒闭的风险。
On top of that, wage cuts, contract default risks and layoffs have become a problem for companies, with 10.64% of the companies surveyed at risk of bankruptcy or bankruptcy.
图 / 智联招聘招聘职位的数量则出现断崖式下降，智联招聘的数据显示，复工第一周（2.3-2.7）的招聘职位数较2019年同期下降71.66%。
The number of recruitment posts in the FIT / JFSU shows a precipitous decline, with recruitment figures for the first week back to work (2.3-2.7) showing a 71.66 per cent decrease over the same period in 2019.
在招聘规模上，超过一半的企业将增员需求控制在10人以内，招聘人数在30人以上的企业主减少至四分之一。
In terms of hiring size, more than half of companies have limited their staffing needs to less than 10, and the number of employers with more than 30 employees has been reduced to one quarter.
疫情之下，小微企业受到的冲击更为严重，根据BOSS直聘研究院数据，2020年春节后十天，100人以下的小微企业对于新增人才的需求骤减61%。
Micro and micro enterprises have been hit harder by the epidemic, with demand for new talent falling by 61 per cent in the 10 days after the Spring Festival 2020, according to the BOSS Institute of Direct Employment.
这些小微企业是城镇就业的主力军，贡献超过50%的岗位需求，缩招背后即将引发一系列连锁反应。
These micro and small businesses are the mainstay of urban employment, contributing more than 50% of the demand for jobs, and a chain reaction is about to set in.
智联招聘CEO郭盛对燃财经表示，目前整体的人才市场压力较大。
Guo Sheng, the recruitment CEO of Zhilian, told Flaming Finance that the overall pressure on the talent market is greater.
从企业端来看，实行裁员的企业数量高于积极招人的企业数量，裁员的企业数已经占到了30%以上，但仍在积极招人的企业只占20%-25%。
On the corporate side, the number of companies laying off workers is higher than the number of active recruiters, with more than 30 per cent of them laying off workers, but only 20 to 25 per cent of those still actively recruiting.
据他观察，往年，春节之后应该是一个非常旺盛的求职季。
As he observes, Spring Festival should be a very vigorous job-hunting season in the past.
现在来看，情况完全变了，大概有17%的人不敢贸然跳槽。
Now things are completely different, with about 17% of people afraid to jump on a limb.
投简历的人变少线下岗位求职者不愿线上面试当然在疫情期间，也有一些企业在逆势招人。
CVs are fewer offline job seekers are reluctant to interview online Of course, during the epidemic, some companies are hiring against the trend.
据郭盛介绍，在复工后第一周，平台型的餐饮企业例如美团、饿了么以及KFC等，在大量招收送餐人员。
According to Guo, in the first week after the resumption of work, platform-based catering enterprises such as the U. S., hungry and KFC, in large numbers to recruit food delivery personnel.
另外，线上教育培训企业的招人需求也非常旺盛，包括技术人员以及销售人员都有很大需求。
In addition, the demand for online education and training companies is very strong, including technical staff as well as sales personnel are in great demand.
那么，这个时候，招人是不是会变得更加容易呢？答案未必如此。
So is it easier to hire people at this point? The answer is not necessarily the same.
智联的数据显示，和企业端相比，求职者端的反应更为直接，简历投递数量同比减少了83.35%。
The think-tank showed that job seekers responded more directly than companies, with the number of resumes down 83.35% from a year earlier.
因此整体职场竞争指数（求职者简历投递数/企业招聘职位数，时间周期为当周工作日）为7.8，较去年的13明显下降。
As a result, the overall workplace competition index (number of CVs submitted by job seekers / number of corporate recruitment jobs, with a time frame of 7.8 for the week) was 7.8, down from 13 last year.
位于杭州的母婴行业公司亲宝宝正处于大规模招人中，其创始人兼CEO冯培华告诉燃财经，由于亲宝宝的业务主要在线上，加上业务发展良好，只要物流恢复之后，就不会受太多影响。
Founder and CEO Feng Peihua of Hangzhou-based mother-and-child company, which is hiring on a large scale, told Flaming Finance that as long as logistics recover, baby-sitting businesses are largely online and doing well.
公司的招聘计划在年前就已经定好，Q1的整体规划是继续招聘五六十位正式员工，三四十位实习生，期待在疫情结束后的流量反弹中加速发展。
The company's recruitment plan was set a year ago, and the overall plan for Q1 is to continue recruiting 50-60 regular staff and 30-40 interns, in the hope of accelerating development in the post-epidemic flow rebound.
尽管亲宝宝的招聘团队每人每天都要筛选出30份左右的简历向业务部门推荐，初试一天得有十几场，但和以往相比，亲宝宝收到的简历确实少了很多，特别是线下岗位，比如说质检、线下拍摄的岗位等。
While baby-friendly hiring teams sift through 30 or so resumes a day and recommend them to businesses for a first try, they do receive far fewer resumes than ever before, especially for offline jobs such as quality control and offline filming.
据该公司招聘主管Skye分析，这一方面有疫情造成的人员活动限制原因，也有候选人本身的刻板印象问题。
According to Skye, the company's hiring director, there are reasons for restrictions on movement caused by the epidemic, as well as stereotypes about the candidates themselves.
Skye和团队也开会分析过这个问题，“线下岗位的候选人，他们对于招聘或者说面试的印象更多还是停留在线下，所以当我们联系他时，对方的第一反应是你们什么时候复工，我可以过来面试。
Skye and the team also had a meeting to analyze the issue. "Candidates for off-line positions are still more impressed with hiring or interviewing, so when we contact him, their first reaction is when you get back to work and I can come over for an interview.
对于线上面试的邀请，不少人直接拒绝，认为纯线上的沟通不是特别深入，还是希望等到复工之后再做当面的沟通。
For the on-line interview invitation, many people directly refused to believe that the pure line of communication is not particularly in-depth, or hope to wait until the resumption of work before doing face-to-face communication.
”另外一个受影响比较大的群体，是即将毕业的实习生，因为现在很多学校还没有定具体的开学时间。
Another big group affected are the soon-to-be-graduated interns, as many schools have yet to set a specific start date.
“这个岗位我们最近被放了很多次鸽子，学校没开学，他实际能够提供的实习时长本来就没几个月，因为疫情往后延，时间被压缩得更短，那些无法云入职的岗位候选人，就取消了实习计划。
"We've had a lot of pigeons in this position recently, the school didn't open, he was actually able to offer internships for a few months, because the epidemic was delayed, the time was compressed even shorter, and the internship programme was cancelled for those candidates who couldn't get in.
”Skye称。
"said Skye.
实习生放鸽子背后，反应的是这届应届生求职难的困境。
The intern behind the pigeon, the response is the difficult position of this year's students.
疫情之下，预计今年上半年，高校毕业生就业形势将更加复杂。
In the first half of this year, the employment situation of college graduates is expected to become more complicated.
BOSS直聘研究院数据显示，应届生新增岗位规模同比降幅49%，百人以下小微企业的应届生需求同比降幅达到60%。
Data from the BOSS Institute of Direct Employment showed that the number of new jobs fell 49% year-on-year.
从行业来看，除房地产外，其余行业大类的新增应届生需求全线下降。
From the industry point of view, in addition to real estate, the rest of the industry categories of new college students demand fell.
其中，广告/传媒、汽车行业的应届生需求跌幅超过65%。
Among them, advertising / media, automotive industry freshman demand fell more than 65%.
近两年应届生关注度最高的五大行业：互联网、金融、房地产、专业服务和消费品行业，新增应届生岗位平均降幅达到35.7%。
In the past two years, the top five sectors of concern for students were the Internet, finance, real estate, professional services and consumer goods, with the average number of new freshmen falling by 35.7 per cent.
线下面试和视频面试将长期并存疫情之下，远程办公、线上面试成了新刚需。
On-line interview and video interview will coexist for a long time under the epidemic situation, telecommuting, online interview has become the new needs.
不少HR称，线上化、视频化面试一定是未来招聘的新趋势。
Many HR said that online, video interview is the new trend of future recruitment.
疫情期间，不少招聘网站诸如智联招聘、BOSS直聘、猎聘等都上线了视频面试等新功能，还有很多HR会选择直接在微信群进行视频面试。
During the epidemic, many recruitment sites, such as think-tank recruitment, BOSS direct recruitment, recruitment and other new features such as video interviews online, and many HR will choose to directly conduct video interviews in micro-groups.
除此之外，还有一些专业的视频面试企业正在爆发。
In addition, there are a number of professional video interview companies are breaking out.
目前，提供专业在线视频面试产品的企业主要有两类：专业在线面试（笔试）提供商，包括海纳视频面试、赛码网；智能化招聘管理系统，包括Moka、北森。
At present, there are two main types of enterprises providing professional online video interview products: professional online interview (written test) providers, including Heiner video interview, game code network; intelligent recruitment management system, including Moka, North Sen.
前者主打企业对外招聘，后者主打HR团队内部沟通管理。
The former is mainly engaged in external recruitment, the latter mainly in HR team internal communication management.
海纳视频面试在2019年10月上线了1.0版本，同步面市的还有小程序。
Haina Video Interview went live with version 1.0 in October 2019, with small programs on the market.
最近，其客户数量暴增，目前已经有超过2000家公司用户。
Recently, the number of customers has surged, and there are now more than 2,000 corporate users.
为了更好的体验，团队专门抽调人力于2月初推出了APP版本，上线后团队的技术人员几乎每两天就得发一个迭代的版本。
For a better experience, the team launched the APP version in early February, and the team's technical staff had to issue an iterative version almost every two days after it went live.
海纳视频面试背后的群星科技是一家30人规模的初创企业，去年3月成立，其创始人梁公军告诉燃财经，当时决定要做视频面试的判断其实很简单，因为5G马上要来了，一定会给视频在各行各业场景下的应用带来变化，其中在招聘行业的应用就是面试。
Liang Gongjun, founder of Henna Video Interview, a 30-person start-up founded in March last year, told Caijing that the decision to do a video interview was simple because the 5G was coming and would certainly change the way videos are used in all walks of life, including interviews in the hiring industry.
图 / 视觉中国“只不过我没想到是在疫情爆发的情况下迎来用户激增。
Photo / Visual China "It's just that I didn't expect to see a surge in users in the event of an outbreak.
”梁公军称，一些招聘网站也在提供视频面试的功能，但面试本身要做好很不容易，越是专业的场景，尤其是偏商务的专业场景，越需要专业的工具来打穿打透。
Some job sites also offer video-interview functions, he said, but the job interview itself is hard to do, and the more professional the scene, especially in a business-biased professional setting, the more professional tools are needed to punch through.
他认为，海纳视频面试有一些差异化优势。
He believes that Haina video interview has some differentiation advantages.
首先，整个招聘的流程特别长、环节很多，需要HR、候选人和面试官之间来回沟通，很容易混乱无序。
First of all, the recruitment process is extremely long and numerous, requiring HR, candidate and interviewer to communicate back and forth.
海纳视频面试能够对整个面试流程做自动的通知和推进。
Heiner Video Interview can automatically inform and propel the whole interview process.
其次，微信群没法做权限分层，海纳能提供多人招聘团队的权限管理和协同推进，并且对候选人的数据进行自动存档、统计和分析。
Secondly, the micro-groups can not do hierarchical access, Heiner can provide multi-recruitment team access management and coordination, and automated archiving, statistics and analysis of candidates' data.
最后是面试录像，多人面试时无需所有面试官到场，主面试官到位以后，就立马可以开始面试，其余面试官可以看录像进行辅助判断和评估。
When the interviewer is in place, he or she can begin the interview right away. The rest of the interviewer can watch the video for additional judgment and evaluation.
据Skye介绍，亲宝宝之前有部分岗位就是线上面试，主要是社群运营之类的线上工作，“这次疫情在某种程度上来说倒逼我们所有的岗位都要进行线上面试，跑通所有流程。
Some of the jobs before the kiss were online interviews, mostly community-run online jobs, according to Skye. "This epidemic has forced all of our jobs to have online interviews and run through all the processes.
”她说。
'she said.
为了节省内部很多信息流转的沟通成本，亲宝宝使用了Moka招聘系统。
To save many of the internal communication costs of information flow, pro-baby uses the Moka recruitment system.
“之前我们收到简历要发给业务部门，业务部门筛选完之后再给到我们反馈，我们安排面试之后还要和他们沟通时间，一旦需要调整时间还得再沟通。
"We received our resumes to the business department, which screened them out and then gave us feedback, and we had to communicate with them after we scheduled the interview and then again once we needed to adjust the time," he said.
这些琐碎的沟通在系统里就可以协同，还能做信息的留存和备份，在远程办公的时候非常有优势。
These trivial communications can be coordinated in the system, but also to do information retention and backup, in telecommuting when very advantageous.
”Skye称。
"said Skye.
不过，线上面试也存在着一些天然的劣势。
However, online interviews also have some natural disadvantages.
Skye介绍，对于一些公司比较看重的岗位，经过三四轮面试之后，战线被拉长。
Skye says the front lines are lengthened after three or four rounds of interviews for positions that some companies value.
如果在线下，半天时间就能解决，线上因为协调不开，就要变成好几天，这会给候选人带来一些观感上的不适。
If you're offline, half a day can be resolved, and if the line doesn't work out, it's going to take days, which can make candidates feel a bit uncomfortable.
为此，团队对一些岗位的招聘流程做了缩减或者合并。
To this end, the team has reduced or merged the recruitment process for some positions.
在智联招聘CEO郭盛看来，视频本身是一个长期的风口，但是视频面试未必是风口。
In the view of recruitment CEO Guo Sheng, video itself is a long-term air mouth, but video interviews are not necessarily a bellwether.
企业通过视频进行面试，肯定是希望尽可能多的了解求职者，希望知道求职者和企业有没有非常好的化学反应。
Enterprises through video interviews, is sure to know as much as possible about job seekers, want to know whether there is a very good chemical reaction between job seekers and enterprises.
但视频面试由于是远程，很多丰富的信息可能就无法捕捉了，这是对视频面试的一个巨大的阻挠。
But because video interviews are remote, a lot of rich information can't be captured, which is a huge hindrance to video interviews.
他认为，在这个特殊时期，企业没有选择，只能做视频面试。
He thinks, in this special period, the enterprise has no choice but to do video interview.
面试本身是一个传统行业，在未来，面试一定还是视频和线下互相结合的状态。
Interview itself is a traditional industry, in the future, the interview must be a combination of video and online state.
企业应提前做准备要在晴天修屋顶除了招人，怎样用人也是企业最关心的问题。
Enterprises should make preparations in advance to repair the roof on a sunny day in addition to hiring, how to employ people is also the enterprise's greatest concern.
这次疫情来得突然，很多企业没有这样的应急经验，更谈不上提前准备。
This outbreak came suddenly, many enterprises do not have such emergency experience, let alone advance preparation.
对于一家企业来说，“人”的问题有时候比“钱”的问题还要复杂。
For a business, the "human" problem is sometimes more complex than the "money" problem.
这次疫情，对雇主的更大考验在于管理的内功。
The greater test of this epidemic for employers lies in managerial prowess.
大成律师事务所高级合伙人付勇告诉燃财经，就他最近接触的企业来看，抛开国有企业、外资企业不谈，很多中型企业的现金流撑不过两三个月，今年一年公司的效益能否撑得住，目前公司人员如何安排，成了企业主最头疼的事。
Dacheng Law Firm senior partner Fu Yong told Flaming Finance that, apart from state-owned enterprises and foreign-owned enterprises, many medium-sized enterprises can't sustain their cash flow for more than two or three months.
面对疫情造成的冲击，不少企业向政府发出了求助信号。
Faced with the impact of the epidemic, many enterprises to the government issued a call for help.
对此，人力资源和社会保障部于1月24日就疫情下的劳动关系问题发布通知，表示企业在经营困难下，可采取调整薪酬、轮岗轮休、缩短工时等方式稳定岗位，以降低失业风险，尽量不裁员或少裁员。
In response, on 24 January, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security issued a circular on labour relations in the context of the epidemic, in which it stated that, in the face of operational difficulties, enterprises could stabilize their jobs by adjusting remuneration, rotating breaks and shortening working hours in order to reduce the risk of unemployment and minimize job cuts.
付勇建议，按照劳动法的规定，每周至少休息一天。
Fu Yong suggested taking at least one day off a week, as stipulated in the labor law.
北京等地出台了灵活用工政策，允许企业综合调剂使用年度内的休息日。
Beijing and other places have introduced flexible employment policies, allowing enterprises to use a comprehensive transfer of rest days in the year.
确有困难的企业经过必要的程序，可以考虑从现在开始调剂年度内的休息日，按照相关规定，休息日不算工资。
Enterprises that have genuine difficulties may, after the necessary procedures, consider changing the rest day of the year from now on. In accordance with the relevant regulations, the rest day shall not be regarded as wages.
从2月份开始往后算，2020年大概还有80多天的周末，按一半计算，理论上还有40多天的休息日可以调剂，之后再按照做6休1的方式调剂休息。
From February onwards, there will probably be more than 80 days of weekends in 2020, half of which, in theory, still leaves more than 40 days of rest to adjust, followed by a 6-day break.
通过这种方式，或许能够让企业再坚持一个月。
In this way, companies might be able to hold out for another month.
值得注意的是，即使灵活调休，社保也不能断。
It is worth noting that even with flexible breaks, social security cannot be broken.
付勇提醒，根据国务院及人社部最新政策，免征中小微企业基本养老保险、失业保险、工伤保险单位缴费部分，免征期限不超过5个月；医疗保险单位缴费部分还需正常缴纳，确有严重困难的，可以申请缓缴，缓缴期限原则上不超过6个月。
Fu Yong reminded that, according to the latest policies of the State Council and the Ministry of Human Resources, the basic old-age insurance, unemployment insurance and work injury insurance units should not be exempted from payment for more than five months.
职工个人缴费部分还需正常缴纳。
Individual employee contributions are also subject to regular payment.
一些公司在付勇的建议下正在进行内部的压力测试，针对公司的财务状况做紧急预案。
Some companies are conducting internal stress tests at the suggestion of Mr. Fu to make emergency plans about the company's finances.
那些提前就做好准备的公司，抗风险的能力就比较强。
Companies that are prepared well in advance are more risk-averse.
他为有些客户提前做了员工手册，里面设置了自动降薪制度，在公司碰到行业不景气或者业务严重受挫的情况，可以跟工会或职工代表沟通降薪，从高管到基层员工按由高到低的不同比例进行降薪。
He has pre-written employee manuals for some of his clients, which include automatic pay cuts that can be made in varying proportions from executive to junior staff in the event of a company experiencing a recession or a serious business setback.
此次疫情的突发，也可以被包含在内。
The outbreak of this outbreak could also be included.
“这样做会更加人性化，提前有规章制度依据，将沟通成本前置，现在降下来的工资等业务恢复可以再补回去。
"It would be more humane, have a regulatory basis in advance, pre-position communication costs, and now lower wages and other business recovery can be made up."
但如果没有提前走过民主程序的这种自动降薪制度，紧要关头临时出一个，让企业跟员工去达成协商一致可能就比较困难。
But without such automatic pay cuts, which come early in the democratic process, it may be difficult for companies and employees to reach a consensus at a critical juncture.
”付勇称。
'he said.
对于未来的走势，郭盛认为，2020虽然有很多不确定性，但眼光放远一点，很多问题都是能够解决的。
For the future trend, Guo Sheng believes that 2020, although there is a lot of uncertainty, but with a longer-term perspective, many problems can be solved.
目前来看，疫情并没有出现二次爆发，终究只是长线里面的小波折，不用把它想得太过复杂，大多数企业都能挺过去。
At present, the outbreak has not occurred twice, after all, only a small long-term inside the twists and turns, do not think it too complex, most enterprises can survive.
