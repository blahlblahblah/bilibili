澎湃新闻记者 薛莎莎“我给领导打电话说要返岗，考虑到我刚康复，领导不愿安排我去隔离病房。
Xue Sasha, a journalist, roared, "I called my leader to say I was going back to work, and considering that I had only just recovered, the leader would not let me go to the isolation ward.
我争取后，领导才同意。
After I fought for it, the leader agreed.
”武汉市普仁医院呼吸内科护士韩茜茹2月26日向澎湃新闻记者说。
"Wuhan City Puren Hospital Respiratory Medicine Nurse Han Xiru February 26 told the surging news reporters.
疫情发生后，韩茜茹于1月19日被医院派往金银潭医院支援，随后不幸感染新冠肺炎，治疗8天后康复出院。
After the outbreak, on January 19, Heng Rui was sent to Gold and Silver Pool Hospital for support. She was subsequently infected with pneumonia and was discharged after 8 days of treatment.
隔离近半月后，她捐献了300毫升血浆。
After nearly half a month in isolation, she donated 300 ml of plasma.
捐血浆当天，她致电领导要求返岗，次日到普仁医院开辟出的隔离病区，和同事们并肩作战。
On the day she donated plasma, she called her leader to ask her to return to her job. The next day, she went to Puren Hospital to open an isolation ward to fight alongside her colleagues.
支援一线、确诊、治愈、隔离、献血浆、返岗，至今，韩茜茹抗疫已有39天。
Support for the first line, diagnosis, cure, isolation, plasma, back to work, so far, Hencey Ru has 39 days of anti-epidemic.
其实，得知自己确诊时，韩茜茹也十分担心，但她知道不能表现出来，因为年过五旬的父母会因此更担心更焦虑。
In fact, when she learned of her diagnosis, Han Xiru was also very worried, but she knew she could not show it, because parents over 50 would worry more about it.
住院后，她积极配合治疗，很快康复出院。
After hospitalization, she actively cooperated with treatment and quickly recovered from hospital.
经历了医护人员和病人的双层身份，韩茜茹称，作为病友，她想告诉其他病人，心理上不要有太大负担，要积极配合治疗。
After a double-decker identity as a doctor and a patient, Hansei Ru said, as a patient, she wanted to tell other patients not to have too much psychological burden, to actively cooperate with the treatment.
作为医护人员，她希望病人要相信医护人员一定会尽全力救治，也会尽量满足他们生活上的需求。
As a health care worker, she wants patients to be confident that they will do their best and will try to meet their needs.
正值抗疫时期，韩茜茹希望医护人员和病人之间要相互理解相互体谅，共同打赢这场战争。
During the fight against the epidemic, Hencey Ru hoped that the medical staff and the patients would understand and understand each other, together to win the war.
韩茜茹口述韩茜茹在金银潭医院护理病人。
Han Ciru dictates that Hansei Ru cares for the sick at the gold and silver pool hospital.
本文图均为 受访者供图支援：来到金银潭医院隔离病房我叫韩茜茹，是普仁医院呼吸内科的护士，工作已经8年了。
This picture shows the support of the interviewees: I came to the isolation ward of Gold and Silver Pool Hospital. My name is Han Xizhu. I am a nurse in respiratory department of Puren Hospital.
疫情发生后，我一直在一线工作，我始终没想过自己会被感染。
Since the outbreak, I have been working on the front line, I never thought I would be infected.
1月中上旬，来普仁医院的发热病人越来越多。
Early in January, the number of febrile patients at Lai Pun Hospital increased.
这些病人多有反复发烧，甚至高烧不退的症状，病人的CT片子也和流感病人不一样。
Most of these patients have recurrent fever, or even high fever symptoms, patients with CT pictures are not the same as flu patients.
我们让这些病人住进病房单间，隔离起来。
We put these patients in a single ward, isolated.
1月18日下午，我接到领导的电话，说医院要选派年资较高的护士去支援金银潭医院，护理确诊的新冠肺炎病人，医院暂定选派三名护士，我是其中之一，要询问我以及我父母的意见，大家都同意才能去。
On the afternoon of January 18, I received a telephone call from my supervisor saying that the hospital would send a senior nurse to the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital to take care of the newly diagnosed patients with pneumonia.
说不害怕是假的，我确实有点担心，但医院信任我，才决定让我去，所以我决定去支援金银潭医院。
No fear was false. I was a little worried, but the hospital trusted me and decided to let me go, so I decided to support the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital.
我打电话征求父母的意见，电话中，我听得出他们很担心，但他们还是理解支持我。
I called my parents for advice. On the phone, I could tell they were worried, but they understood and supported me.
1月19日上午，我和另外两名同事来到金银潭医院报到。
On the morning of January 19, two other colleagues and I went to Gold and Silver Pool Hospital to report for duty.
韩茜茹和同事们在病房确诊：我什么症状都没有就感染了？来到金银潭医院，我们进行了各方面事项的培训。
Hansei Ru and colleagues in the ward confirmed: I did not have any symptoms of infection? Come to the gold and silver pool hospital, we conducted training on various matters.
在这里工作的前两天，我实在难以适应。
The first two days I worked here, I couldn't adapt.
我们穿着防护服，在病房里一待就是四个小时。
We wore protective clothing and stayed in the ward for four hours.
四个小时不吃不喝不上厕所，我倒还可以忍受，但是防护服太厚了，十分闷热，呼吸不畅，我在病房里头晕头疼，实在难受。
I could have endured four hours without eating or drinking without a toilet, but the suits were too thick, too hot, too stuffy for my breath, and I felt dizzy and had a headache in the ward.
同时，我还大把大把出汗，每次从病房出来，身上都被汗水浸透。
At the same time, I sweat a lot, every time I come out of the ward, the body is soaked with sweat.
金银潭医院的同事们经常处理传染病人，已经很习惯了，护理病人也熟练。
My colleagues at the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital are used to dealing with infectious diseases and are skilled in caring for patients.
他们给了我很多帮助，在这个过程中，我也学到很多护理传染病病人的知识。
They helped me a lot, and in the process I learned a lot about caring for patients with infectious diseases.
没过几天，我就慢慢习惯这套防护装备了。
In a few days, I got used to the protective gear.
当时，金银潭医院收治的都是各个医院转来的确诊病人，我所在的病区大约住了50多位病人，我和两位同事负责照顾20多位病人。
At that time, Gold and Silver Pool Hospital was full of confirmed patients transferred from various hospitals. About 50 patients were living in my area.
病人无家属陪护，我们既需要进行采血、输液等医疗护理，也需要照顾病人吃饭、喝水、上厕所等生活护理，工作确实挺重。
We need not only medical care such as blood collection and infusion, but also take care of patients' living care such as eating, drinking water and going to toilet.
护理人手不足，我们有时白班工作八个小时后，还要上夜班，从凌晨1点上到早上8点才下班，处于连轴转的状态。
Caregivers are understaffed, and sometimes we work eight hours a day and night shifts, from 1 a.m. to 8 a.m., in a rotating state.
工作几天后，医院例行安排为医护人员进行核酸检测。
After a few days of work, the hospital routinely arranges nucleic acid tests for medical staff.
次日，我按照排班表，可以在家休息一天。
The next day, according to the schedule, I can rest at home for a day.
大年初一（1月25日），父母开车送我去医院上班。
On January 25, my parents drove me to the hospital.
就在上班途中，我得知我感染了新冠肺炎。
On my way to work, I learned that I had pneumonia in the New Crown.
当时，我接到金银潭医院同事打来的电话说我核酸检测呈阳性，让我尽快回医院住院治疗。
At the time, I received a phone call from a colleague at the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital saying that I had tested positive for nucleic acid and was hospitalized as soon as possible.
我听到这个消息的第一反应是：怎么可能？我什么症状都没有怎么就感染了？我不太相信，但电话那头给出的答案十分肯定。
My first reaction to the news was: How could it be? I was infected with almost nothing? I don't believe it, but the answer on the other end of the line was positive.
我很恐慌，但也在不断说服自己接受这个事实。
I was panicked, but I was still trying to convince myself to accept the fact.
我定晴一想，父母就在身旁，他们都已经50多岁了，我不能表现出担心，要不然他们会更担心更害怕的。
I must clear up. I thought my parents were around and they were already in their fifties. I couldn't express my worry, or they would have been more fearful.
父母还考虑我的情绪，反过来安慰我说，“不要紧，积极治疗会好的。
My parents also thought about my emotions and comforted me by saying, "Never mind, active therapy will be fine.
”我回到医院后，又做了一次核酸检测，还是阳性，我就住院了。
"When I got back to the hospital and had another nucleic acid test, I was positive and I was hospitalized.
随后，父母也分别检查了CT，好在他们肺部都无异样，我没有传染给他们。
Subsequently, the parents also examined the CT separately, but fortunately their lungs are no different, I did not infect them.
韩茜茹献血浆治愈：积极治疗，八天出院无论是在普仁医院呼吸内科工作，还是来到金银潭医院支援，我都直接接触确诊病人。
Han Xi Zhuo plasma treatment: active treatment, eight days out of the hospital whether at Puren Hospital Respiratory Department or come to the gold and silver pool hospital support, I have direct contact with confirmed patients.
所以，我真的不知道自己是在什么时候感染的。
So, I really don't know when I got the infection.
住院后的前几天，我的身体逐渐有了症状，开始食欲不振，我很想吃，但每天吃得仍然很少。
A few days after I was admitted to the hospital, my body gradually began to show signs of loss of appetite, and I wanted to eat, but I still ate very little.
虽然自己心里很害怕，但看到同病房里的其他病人高烧不退，咳嗽不止，我想我的病情应该属于轻症，心里暗自庆幸，幸亏发现得及时，及早治疗。
Although my heart is very scared, but to see other patients in the ward high fever, cough, I think my illness should belong to a light disease, the heart secretly glad, luckily found in time, early treatment.
慢慢地，我的心态也好了些。
Slowly, my mood was better.
父母有时打电话问我身体是否有不舒服，我一般不向他们传递负面消息，不想让他们为我担心。
Sometimes my parents call me and ask if I'm feeling well. I don't usually send them negative messages. I don't want them to worry about me.
医生给我开了一些抗病毒、抗感染的药。
The doctor prescribed me some antiviral, anti-infective drugs.
他们都很照顾我。
They take good care of me.
医院院长和其他领导得知我的情况后，还特意来看望慰问我。
When the hospital director and other leaders learned about me, they also came to see me.
我都挺感动的。
I'm all touched.
本来我的病情就不重，加上积极配合治疗，约一周后，我做的核酸检测就已经转阴，我在2月3日出院。
My condition wasn't serious, and after about a week of aggressive treatment, my nucleic acid test was cloudy and I was discharged on February 3.
按照规定，我要回家隔离近半个月。
As a rule, I'm going home and secluded for almost half a month.
在这期间，我住在自己的房间，单独吃饭，度过隔离期。
During this time, I stayed in my room, ate alone and spent the isolation period.
韩茜茹和血液中心工作人员合影留念返岗：争取后，领导同意回一线岗就在隔离期间，我在电视上看到金银潭医院院长呼吁康复的新冠肺炎病人捐献血浆。
Hansei Ru and the blood center staff to take a picture back to work: after fighting, the leadership agreed to go back to frontline guard during the isolation period, I saw on television gold and silver pool hospital director called for the recovery of patients with new crown pneumonia donated plasma.
我就萌生了献血浆的想法。
I had the idea of plasma donation.
2月16日，我献了300毫升的血浆。
On Feb. 16, I gave you 300 milliliters of plasma.
随后，我就打电话给普仁医院的护理部领导表明了自己想要返回一线岗位的想法。
Then I called the head of the nursing department at Prynne Hospital to make clear my desire to return to the front line.
领导听后很犹豫，考虑到我刚康复，领导说回来工作可以，但不能去一线，只能去普通病房，照顾其他病人。
After listening to very hesitant, considering that I have just recovered, the leader said back to work can, but can not go to the first line, can only go to the general ward, care for other patients.
我坚持要返回隔离病房去护理新冠肺炎病人。
I insist on going back to the isolation ward to care for patients with Newcastle pneumonia.
一方面，我此前就在金银潭医院支援，已经学到了很多这方面的知识和经验。
On the one hand, I have learned a lot of knowledge and experience from the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital.
另一方面，我所了解到的，康复的病人好像没有被再次感染的。
On the other hand, what I've learned is that convalescent patients do not seem to be reinfected.
基于这两点，我认为我去一线工作，风险不大，只要做好防护，应该不会被感染。
Based on these two points, I think I go to the front-line work, the risk is not big, as long as the protection, should not be infected.
我争取后，领导终于同意我去一线。
After I fought for it, the leader finally agreed to let me go first.
那时，普仁医院刚开辟出第十个隔离病区，用来收治确诊病人，所以我顺理成章的在十病区开始工作。
At that time, Puren Hospital has just opened a tenth quarantine area, used to treat confirmed patients, so I naturally began work in the ten-disease area.
2月17日，我就进入工作状态了。
On February 17, I went to work.
有了在金银潭医院工作的基础，我在普仁医院的工作上手得更快。
With the foundation of working at Gold and Silver Pool Hospital, I was able to work faster at Puerne Hospital.
面对病人，我们医护人员总想多鼓励他们。
Facing the patients, we medical staff always want to encourage them more.
病房里有一位阿姨，一家三口都感染了新冠肺炎，病情都比较重，她老伴已经因此离世。
In the ward, there was an aunt, a family of three people are infected with new crown pneumonia, serious illness, her old wife has died as a result.
她和儿子住在一间病房里，每天的情绪很消极。
She lives in a ward with her son and is in a negative mood every day.
有一次，阿姨偷偷问我，“这个病到底能不能治好呀，我们会不会死呀？”我说，“会治好的，不要给自己那么大压力，你看看你现在都可以自己下床、上厕所，还能好好吃些饭菜，已经好转了，要对自己有信心。
Once, my aunt secretly asked me, "This disease can be cured, we will not die?" I said, "it will be cured, do not give yourself so much pressure, you can now see you can get out of bed, go to the toilet, have a good meal, have improved, have faith in yourself.
”后来，这位阿姨心态慢慢变好，身体也在慢慢变好。
"Later, the aunt's mind slowly changed for the better and her health slowly improved.
如今，她和儿子再恢复几天，差不多就能出院了。
Now she and her son are a few more days away from the hospital.
这段时间，我从医护人员转变成病人，又从病人转变成医护人员，经历了这两种不同的身份。
During that time, I changed from a paramedics to a patient, from a patient to a healthcare worker, and experienced these two different identities.
作为病友，我想告诉那些正在接受治疗的人，一定要保持好心态，积极配合治疗，现在治愈率越来越高，不要过于担心。
As patients, I would like to tell those who are receiving treatment, must maintain a good attitude, actively cooperate with treatment, now the cure rate is increasing, do not worry too much.
作为医护人员，我希望病人们能够相信我们一定会尽全力治疗他们，也会尽力满足他们生活上的需求。
As health care workers, I hope patients can be sure that we will do our best to treat them and that we will do our best to meet their needs in life.
当前，疫情防控工作仍然严峻，医护人员每天的工作压力和精神压力都很大，我们看到病人抢救无效离世，也很伤心很无助。
At present, the prevention and control of the epidemic is still very serious, the daily work pressure and mental pressure of medical staff are very big, we see the invalid rescue dead, also very sad and helpless.
特殊时期，我希望医护人员和病人之间要相互理解相互体谅，共同打赢这场战争。
In special periods, I hope that medical staff and patients should understand and understand each other, together to win the war.
