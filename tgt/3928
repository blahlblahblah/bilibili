实习记者 | 文思敏编辑 | 倪  妮眼下，居住在英国苏格兰首府爱丁堡的Naomi感到很无助。
At the moment, Naomi, who lives in Edinburgh, Scotland's capital, feels helpless.
Naomi来自中国台湾，在英国已经居住了近七年，丈夫James则是苏格兰本地人。
Naomi is from Taiwan, China, and has lived in the UK for nearly seven years, with her husband James, a native of Scotland.
从3月7日起，James开始出现咳嗽、发烧、颈部疼痛、呼吸急促、全身无力等症状——对照网上给出的参考，10项新冠肺炎症状中了9项。
From March 7, James began to develop cough, fever, neck pain, shortness of breath and general weakness - nine out of 10 new crown pneumonia symptoms, according to online references.
夫妻二人立刻拨打了111医疗专线，在问询过情况后，医疗人员表示，由于James身边没有确诊案例，也并非从疫区回来，不需要做检测。
The couple immediately called the 111 medical line and, after questioning, the medical staff said no tests were needed because James did not have a confirmed case with him and did not return from an infected area.
“你应该没有感染，不用担心。
"You shouldn't be infected, don't worry.
”电话那头的医疗人员说道。
"said the doctor at the other end of the line.
Naomi希望丈夫能在家里隔离，但丈夫一开始并没有当回事，也不愿意戴口罩，甚至还像平时一样去了酒吧、演唱会、足球赛、单口喜剧秀等公共场所。
Naomi wanted her husband to be isolated at home, but he wasn't serious at first, didn't want to wear a mask and even went to bars, concerts, football games, comedy shows and other public places as usual.
“大家的观念很不一样，他们就是把这个当作流感，或者症状严重一些的流感。
"People have very different ideas. They just think of it as flu, or something a bit more serious.
”Naomi对《第一财经》YiMagazine说。
Naomi told First Finance Yi Magazine.
更糟糕的是，丈夫出现症状的第二天，他们14个月大的女儿小哈利也开始发高烧，Naomi带着女儿去医院看急诊，但医生只做了基本的检查，开了些消炎药和抗生素。
To make matters worse, the day after her husband developed symptoms, their 14-month-old daughter, Harry Jr., also had a fever. Naomi and her daughter went to the hospital for an emergency.
在丈夫和女儿都出现症状的一个星期里，Naomi不仅给111医疗专线打过电话，还向家庭医生问询过。
Naomi not only called the 111 lines, but also spoke to her family doctor during the week when her husband and daughter both had symptoms.
后者告知，请自行到大医院急诊处报到。
The latter advised you to report to the emergency department of the main hospital.
然而几经周折到达医院后，急诊处门前却贴着一张通告：有新型冠状病毒症状的人不准进入，请自行回家隔离。
However, after many twists and turns to arrive at the hospital, but the emergency department in front of a notice: people with new coronavirus symptoms are not allowed to enter, please go home to isolate.
面对新冠疫情在欧洲不断蔓延，3月12日，英国首相鲍里斯·约翰逊提出了一个与多数国家截然相反的防疫思路：如果英国有60%的人（约4000万人）感染新冠肺炎，并在康复后获得免疫，就能彻底切断病毒传播，英国人将全部安全，即所谓的“群体免疫”。
Faced with the spread of the new crown in Europe, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on March 12 came up with an antithesis to most countries: If 60% of the UK population (about 40 million people) were newly infected with pneumonia and immunized after recovery, the virus would be completely cut off and the British would be completely safe, the so-called "mass immunization."
为此，英国不会停课或禁止集会，出现轻微症状的患者也只被要求居家隔离一周，无需接受病毒检测，政府唯一的建议就是勤洗手并保持警惕。
For that reason, Britain does not suspend classes or ban meetings, and patients with mild symptoms are only asked to remain in quarantine for a week without being tested for the virus.
在Naomi最后一次拨打家庭医生电话时，医生终于把求诊电话转到了苏格兰最大的儿童专科医院，又经过四个小时的等待，医院表示愿意接诊小哈利。
The last time Naomi called a family doctor, the doctor finally transferred the call to Scotland's largest specialist children's hospital, which offered to take him in for another four hours.
该儿童医院急诊部门与Naomi之前去的急诊很不一样，医院空间已一分为二，专门为接诊新冠病例设立了隔离区。
The Children's Hospital Emergency Unit is very different from Naomi's previous emergency visits, and the hospital space has been split in two, with an area of separation dedicated to new crown cases.
在这里，医护人员穿上了防护服，从头包裹到脚。
Here, the paramedics put on protective clothing and covered their feet from head to foot.
“里面都是隔离房，门关着，只能听到一些小朋友的哭声。
"Inside were isolated rooms, the doors were closed, and only the cries of some children could be heard.
”医生认为小哈利的精神状况不错，行为能力也很好，没有必要检测和抽血，建议孩子状况变严重后再来复诊。
"The doctors thought Harry was in good spirits and had good behavioral skills. There was no need for tests or blood tests.
医生对Naomi坦承：再过不久大部分人都会感染，做检测不会改变医院处理病患的方式，检测完依然会让病人先回家隔离，因为目前病毒无药可医，只能让身体自行对抗，医院只会接收重症的病患。
The doctors admitted to Naomi that most people will get infected in the near future. Testing will not change the way patients are treated in hospitals. Testing will still allow patients to go home and be quarantined because there is currently no cure for the virus.
不出意料，“群体免疫”言论一出，在全球立即引起了极大争议。
Unsurprisingly, the outpouring of "mass immunization" caused immediate global controversy.
3月14日，229名英国各大学的科学家联名发表公开信，表达了对政府行动的担忧。
On March 14, 229 scientists from British universities issued an open letter expressing concern about the government's actions.
伦敦大学学院全球卫生学会主任Anthony Costello也在Twitter发布了一连串质疑。
Anthony Costello, director of the Institute for Global Health at University College London, also posted a string of Twitter questions.
其中一条提到：“这是否会削减我们为遏制疫情做的努力，以及造成在近期内更多的感染和死亡？有证据表明，早期感染者和无症状感染者都会导致大规模的病毒传播。
"Does this reduce our efforts to contain the epidemic and cause more infections and deaths in the near future? There is evidence that both early-stage infections and asymptomatic infections contribute to large-scale transmission of the virus."
”229名英国科学家的公开信3月16日,在疫情蔓延和舆论的声讨下，约翰逊升级了防控措施：家里但凡有一人出现发烧咳嗽等症状，全家人都应该自我隔离14天，并呼吁避免人际间的不必要接触，停止非必要旅行，尽量不前往人群密集的地方，居家工作等，但实际上也并没有推翻“群体免疫”的思路。
Johnson stepped up control measures on March 16 in the face of widespread epidemics and public outcry: Families should be kept isolated for 14 days if one person developed symptoms such as fever and coughing, and urged families to avoid unnecessary contact, stop non-essential travel, avoid crowding out and work from home.
而首次公开阐释这一概念的英政府首席科学顾问Patrick Vallance则不得不站出来表示，“群体免疫”会是传染病疫情带来的附加结果，而不应该是一个直接的策略。
Patrick Vallance, chief scientific adviser to the British government, who first publicly articulated the concept, said mass immunization would be a side effect of the epidemic, not a direct strategy.
3月16日，鲍里斯·约翰逊在新闻发布会上做疫情讲话。
On 16 March, Boris Johnson gave a speech on the epidemic at a press conference.
| 图片来源：新华社截至当地时间3月18日上午9点，英国累计新冠肺炎确诊病例达2626例，而过去24小时内，报告的新增病例就达676例。
Source: Xinhua News Agency reported 2,626 confirmed cases of pneumonia in the UK by 9 a.m. March 18 (local time), compared with 676 new cases reported in the past 24 hours.
三天前，英国广播公司（BBC）曾报道称，预计英国目前实际感染人数在3.5万至5万人。
Three days ago, the BBC reported that between 35,000 and 50,000 people were currently expected to be infected in the UK.
3月16日，伦敦周一早高峰期间地铁乘客数量明显减少。
On March 16, the number of subway passengers fell sharply during the peak of Monday morning in London.

在伦敦一家疗养院工作的英国人Liam Smith介绍说，现在英国超市里的卫生纸已经卖空，药店里也很难再买到扑热息痛和洗手液。
Liam Smith, an Englishman at a nursing home in London, said toilet paper was sold short in British supermarkets and paracetamol and hand sanitizers were hard to find in pharmacies.
“上个周六，你会发现大家还都往酒吧跑。
"Last Saturday, you would have noticed that everyone was still running for the bar.
这个周六，我相信应该没有人会再要去酒吧了。
This Saturday, I'm sure no one will ever go to a bar again.
”一张老人在英国萨里某间超市里对着空货架核对购物清单的照片目前在英国社交网络被广泛转发。
A photograph of an old man checking his shopping list against an empty shelf at a British supermarket in Surrey is being widely distributed on British social networks.
不少人呼吁希望可以遏制因新冠肺炎而起的抢购潮。
Many are calling for hope to stem the rush for new crowns due to pneumonia.
不过，Smith认为，“群体免疫”被很多人误解了。
Still, Smith says, "mass immunization" has been misunderstood by many.
“那样说是因为疫情扩大的不可阻挡性。
That is because of the unstoppable nature of the spread of the epidemic.
”Liam对《第一财经》YiMagazine说，“当然，从大范围的观感来看，大多数人都认为这是荒谬的。
"Of course, on a broad scale, most people think it's ridiculous," Liam told First Finance Yi Magazine.
”英国稍显佛系的防疫行为实际上与其防疫策略挂钩。
The immunization practices of Britain's Slight Buddhists are in fact linked to their vaccination strategies.
3月3日，英国卫生部发布了一份《新型冠状病毒防疫行动计划》，文件明确提到了英国当局此次应对新冠病毒的计划主要分为四个阶段——第一阶段：控制。
On March 3, the Ministry of Health issued a new coronavirus vaccination action plan, which clearly mentions that the British authorities plan to tackle the new coronavirus is divided into four main phases - the first: control.
发现早期病例，跟踪密切接触者，防止疾病扩散到全国。
Early cases are detected and close contacts are followed to prevent the spread of the disease throughout the country.
第二阶段：延迟。
Phase II: Delayed.
减缓病毒的传播速度，如果奏效，会推迟疫情高峰的到来，以避免对冬季产生的影响。
Slowing down the spread of the virus, if successful, would delay the peak of the epidemic to avoid winter effects.
第三阶段：研究。
Phase III: Research.
了解病毒，以降低对人群的影响；提高创新性，包括诊断、药物和疫苗等方面的创新；寻求最有效的应对模型。
Learn about the virus to reduce its impact on people; improve innovation, including in diagnostics, drugs and vaccines; and seek the most effective matching models.
第四阶段：缓和。
Phase 4: Moderation.
为感染者提供护理与支持，政府将采取措施缓解医疗机构面临的压力，以保证能提供必要的医疗服务。
To provide care and support to infected persons, the Government will take measures to alleviate the pressure on medical institutions in order to ensure the provision of necessary medical services.
同时，也将会最大化降低对社会、公共服务和经济的影响。
At the same time, it will maximize the impact on society, public services and the economy.
由于目前英国感染人数已呈扩大趋势，这意味着早期遏制病毒的可能性已经远去。
With the number of infections already on the rise in the UK, the possibility of early containment of the virus is remote.
因此根据《防疫行动计划》，英国目前开始采取第二阶段的“延迟”策略。
As a result, the UK is now embarking on the second phase of its "delayed" strategy under the Vaccine Action Plan.
其主要思想在于通过采取措施来延迟峰值的到来——承认将与病毒长期共存，以拉平感染人数峰值曲线。
The main idea is to delay the peak by acknowledging that it will co-exist with the virus for a long time to smooth out the peak infection curve.
在“群体免疫”备受争议后，英国现任卫生大臣Matt Hancock 3月14日在《电讯报》发布文章称：群体免疫并不是我们计划的一部分。
"Group immunization is not part of our plan," Matt Hancock, Britain's current health minister, said in an article in The Telegraph on March 14 after the controversy over mass immunization.
这是一个科学概念，既不是一个目标，也不是战略。
This is a scientific concept, neither a goal nor a strategy.
我们的目标是保护生命不受到这种病毒的侵害，保护最脆弱的人群，并通过遏制、拖延、研究和缓解来保护国民医疗服务体系（National Health Service，简称NHS）。
Our goal is to protect lives from the virus, protect the most vulnerable, and protect the National Health Service (NHS) through containment, delay, research, and mitigation.
NHS体系是对英国英格兰、苏格兰、威尔士和爱尔兰四个地区公营医疗体系的统称。
The NHS system is a generic term for the public health care systems of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland.
最初起源于第二次世界大战后福利改革的兴起，设立的初衷是为全民提供普遍而免费的医疗服务。
Originally derived from the rise of welfare reform after the Second World War, the intention was to provide universal and free medical care for all.
很长一段时间，NHS都是这个国家最引以为傲的资产。
For a long time, the NHS was the country's proudest asset.
因提倡公平性，面向全民免费，同时又有着领先的诊疗水平和管理方式，其一直被誉为全球最好的医疗服务系统之一。
It has been hailed as one of the best medical service systems in the world for its fairness, free access for all and its leading standards of diagnosis and management.
因私立医院昂贵，NHS体系便成了英国医疗系统的大动脉，绝大多数国民诊疗都依靠它完成。
Because private hospitals are expensive, the NHS system is the backbone of Britain's health-care system, on which most national consultations depend.
不可避免的，如何保卫NHS能正常平稳运行，便成了英国此次抗疫核心。
Inevitably, how to protect the NHS to run smoothly and normally has become the core of the British epidemic.
在文章里，Hancock直言：“我们必须保护弱势群体，保护NHS，并拉平曲线。
In the article, Hancock argues bluntly: "We must protect the vulnerable, protect the NHS, and flatten the curve."
”而急迫需要拉平曲线的原因在于NHS当前的脆弱性，根本不足以应对新冠肺炎病患激增的风险。
The urgent need to flatten the curve stems from the NHS's current vulnerability, which is simply insufficient to cope with the risk of a surge in new crown pneumonia.
因此英国采取了抓重症，放轻症的策略。
So Britain has adopted a strategy of catching serious and debilitating diseases.
《卫报》3月15日发布的一篇医护人员口述文章《一个医生的故事：我们没有口罩、护目镜，以及员工》提到，除去缺少物资设备以及足够的员工外，其所在的医院已经达到了98%的满员率，且均为“社会病患”，这些病患还未达到出院条件且无处可去，这也意味着，病毒临门，医院却没有空间再去容纳即将到来的新型冠状病患。
The Guardian's March 15 oral article, "A doctor's story: We don't have masks, goggles, and staff," mentions that the hospital is 98% staffed and "socially ill," who are not ready to be discharged and have nowhere else to go.
而根据《电讯报》给出的数据，处理新冠病毒感染病患大约需要56万张床和另外9.3万张带通风机的重症监护床。
According to the Telegraph, about 560,000 beds and an additional 93,000 intensive care beds with ventilators are needed to treat new crown infections.
现实是，目前NHS总共只有不到15万张床位，其中重症监护床位只有4000张，并且，目前重症监护床的占用率已达83%。
The reality is that the NHS currently has fewer than 150,000 beds, of which only 4,000 are under intensive care, and the current occupancy rate for intensive care beds is 83 per cent.
而来自英国国家医疗服务体系的数据也证实了这点：在截至2月16日的一周内，英国132家NHS体系下的医院平均床位占用率为94%——在疫情到来之前，很多医院已经没有床位了。
This is confirmed by figures from the National Health Service, which had an average bed occupancy rate of 94 per cent in 132 NHS hospitals in the week ending Feb. 16 - many hospitals were without beds before the outbreak.
床位占用率高是英国医疗体系的常态。
High bed occupancy is the norm in Britain's health care system.
从全球来看，英国有着倒数的人均医院床位率。
Globally, the UK has one of the lowest per capita hospital beds.
根据经合组织官网发布的数据，2017年，英国平均每1000人仅拥有2.5张病床。
In 2017, the UK had only 2.5 beds for every 1,000 people, according to figures released on the OECD website.
特别是在流感高发的冬季，床位占用率可高达95%。
Bed occupancy can be as high as 95 per cent, especially during the winter months of high influenza prevalence.

另外，英国政府无法直接免费征用私立医院床位。
In addition, the British Government cannot directly requisition private hospital beds free of charge.
为了解决病床困境，在野党工党已联合工会向英国首相提议征用英国570家私立医院的8000张床位，以舒缓NHS即将面临的医疗压力。
The opposition Labour Party has joined forces with the British prime minister to secure 8,000 beds in 570 private hospitals to relieve the NHS's looming medical stress.
然而，这对于即将数以万计的患者来说仍然杯水车薪。
However, that is still a small price to pay for the tens of thousands of patients at hand.
而支付私立医院的征用费用也是一笔不小的花费，据估算，就床位费而言，每张床位每夜的租用费用为300英镑（约合2464元人民币），这意味着，仅就征用床位，英国政府每天就将支出约240万英镑（约合1971万元人民币）。
Paying for private hospitals is also a big expense, with bed rates estimated at ￡300 a night (about Rmb2,464), meaning the government will spend about ￡2.4m (about Rmb1,971.7m) a day on beds alone.
Naomi目前对英国的医疗系统很不满，这并不是她一个人的观感。
Naomi is not alone in her current discontent with the British health-care system.
据2019年的《英国社会态度查》报告，自2010年起，英国国民对NHS的满意度就呈滑坡趋势。
According to the 2019 British Social Attitudes Survey, satisfaction with the NHS has declined since 2010.
自2010年起，英国国民对NHS的满意度呈下降趋势。
Since 2010, there has been a downward trend in NHS satisfaction among British nationals.

漫长的看诊效率、难以解决的财政赤字、逐年削减的预算、日益流失的医护人员，让这个在公费医疗模式下运行了70年的医疗系统积重难返，执政党保守党与工党针对NHS系统下的部分医院是否要私有化的问题讨论已久。
Long waiting lists, intractable budget deficits, shrinking budgets, and dwindling health-care workers have kept the health-care system afloat for 70 years, with the ruling Conservative and Labour parties debating whether to privatize some of the hospitals under the NHS.
“这次抗疫将会映证NHS系统是否要私有化才会更有效率，防疫的成败对两党来说都是一把枪。
"This fight will show whether the NHS system is going to be privatized to be more efficient, and the success or failure of immunization is a gun for both parties."
从保守党的角度讲，他们现在在尽力避免医疗资源发生挤兑。
Conservatives, for their part, are trying to avoid a run on health resources.
”当代英国政治研究者杨阳对《第一财经》YiMagzine说，“医疗挤兑一旦发生，NHS也许会不堪重负。
Yang Yang, a contemporary British political researcher, told First Finance Yi Magzine: "The NHS may be overwhelmed by a run on health care.
过去十年里，保守党对NHS投入减少的负面效果会立马暴露出来。
Over the past decade, the negative effects of the Conservatives "reduced investment in the NHS will soon become apparent.
”可以预见的是，如果NHS的问题无法在短期内得到有效改善，无论愿意与否，英国只能走上“群体免疫”的道路。
Predictably, if the NHS's problems do not improve effectively in the short term, the UK will, like it or not, be on a "herd immunization" path.
更有专家指出，英国离意大利目前所处的状态大约还剩不到四周。
Some experts point out that Britain is in less than four weeks from where Italy is.
3月18日晚，约翰逊在新冠疫情发布会上宣布，从本周五（20日）开始，除了少数关键岗位防疫一线人员医护人员的子女和一些弱势群体儿童等可以继续上学外，英格兰的所有学校和幼儿园等教育机构全部停课，5月和6月的升学考试也被取消。
On the night of March 18, Johnson announced at the Nov. 18 news conference that, with the exception of a few children of frontline health workers and children from disadvantaged groups who were able to continue their education, all schools and kindergartens in England had been closed, and the May and June entrance exams had been cancelled.
18日上午，苏格兰和威尔士政府已经先行决定学校停课。
On the morning of the 18th, the Scottish and Welsh governments had already decided to close their schools.
留给英国的时间不多了，而英国的防疫政策和措施已渐趋积极。
Time is running out for Britain, and its anti-epidemic policies and measures are becoming more aggressive.
