《新民周刊》记者在现场看到，查控至少有六道程序：1、离检查卡口还有几百米的地方，工作人员开始对车辆进行分流引导，例如客货分开、沪牌和非沪牌车辆分开，并提醒他们打开车窗、关闭空调，以免影响之后的测温准确性。
A few hundred meters from the checkpoint, staff began diverting vehicles, such as separating passenger and cargo, Shanghai and non-Shanghai vehicles, and alerting them to open windows and close air conditioners to avoid compromising the accuracy of temperature measurement.
2、志愿者手持上海卫健委开发的“健康云”返沪人员健康信息平台二维码，让在排队等待的车上人员提前扫码填写。

前两类人员接受更详细的再次检查后，仍体温异常的将由卫健部门人员用救护车直接送往医院，同车的密切接触人员由属地政府送往集中隔离点。
After more detailed re-examination of the first two categories, those with still abnormal body temperature will be taken directly to the hospital by ambulance by the health service personnel, and close contact with the vehicle will be sent from the territorial Government to the central isolation points.
需被劝返人员在此被引导返程。

上海的9处省界高速道口公安检查站，均已按上述程序开展了疫情查控。

在需要时，充足的战斗力量迅速补充到了一线。
In times of need, sufficient combat power is quickly added to the line.
严格的查控之下，违规者无所遁形。
Under strict control, offenders do not escape.
2月11日上午8时左右，上海市公安局松江分局的民警就是在这个检查站执行查控任务时，在一辆浙牌小轿车后备厢内，发现藏有一名疫情重点地区女性。
At around 8 a.m. on February 11, police officers from the Songjiang branch of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau were on a search and control mission at the checkpoint when a woman was found hidden in a reserve box of a Zhejiang minibus.
民警调查发现，该女子长期在上海工作，1月22日从上海回到重点地区的老家过年。
The police investigation found that the woman long-term work in Shanghai, January 22 from Shanghai back to key areas of the New Year home.
2月11日清晨，她搭乘朋友的轿车回沪，由于听闻上海在各高速公路道口实施了非常严格的查控措施，为避免返沪后被隔离观察14天，所以藏匿在轿车后备厢内，企图蒙混过关。
In the early morning of February 11, she returned to Shanghai in a friend's limousine. Having heard that Shanghai had put in place very strict control measures at the expressway entrances, she hid in the car reserve to avoid being isolated for 14 days after returning to Shanghai in an attempt to muddle through.
经检测，该女子及车主体温均正常。
Tests showed that the woman and the owner had normal body temperature.
这是上海警方查获的首起藏匿轿车后备厢企图逃避检查的事件。
It was the first time the Shanghai police had seized a car stash in an attempt to evade detection.
2月12日，松江分局民警在G60枫泾检查站查看入沪车辆的后备厢。
On February 12, police officers from Songjiang District inspected the back-up box of vehicles entering Shanghai at the G60 Fengjing checkpoint.
摄影：沈琳严控的是病毒，不是“一刀切”拦住人1月27日14时起，上海把原高速公路114处收费站查控力量全部前移至9处高速公路省界道口公安检查站，实施严格的“逢车必检”。
Photo: Shen Lin strictly control the virus, not "one-size-fits-all" stop people since 14: 00 on January 27, Shanghai has moved the original highway 114 toll station investigation and control force forward to 9 highway provincial border crossing public security checkpoints, the implementation of strict "must-have inspection.
后来，又对在沪无居住地、无明确工作的驾车人员劝返。
Later, they tried to persuade motorists who had no place to live and no clear job in Shanghai.
2月11日上午，G50沪渝高速汾湖公安检查站站长、上海市公安局青浦分局交警支队高速大队教导员杨海杰在检查一辆小轿车时发现，司机声称自己是从杭州到上海来工作，但是根据他的证件，在警方的系统查不到任何他在上海的居住地。
On the morning of February 11, Yang Haijie, director of the Fenhu police checkpoint at the G50 Shanghai-Chongqing High Speed Fen and a member of the Qingpu Branch Traffic Branch of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau found that the driver claimed to be working from Hangzhou to Shanghai.
“对不起，根据规定，你现在不符合进入上海的条件。
"Sorry, according to the regulations, you are not qualified to enter Shanghai now.
请打开双闪灯，开到前面的复检区，我们会有警车引导你在高速上掉头开往原地。
Please turn on the double-flashing lights and drive to the front of the retest area. We'll have a police car to guide you around on the freeway.
”杨海杰告知该司机。
Yang Haijie told the driver.
不久之后的另一根车道上，一辆东部某沿海省份牌照的平板大货车开来。
A short time later, in another driveway, a flatbed van with plates from an eastern coastal province arrived.
这辆车没有载货，经民警核查，司机在上海没有居住地和明确工作，他也被当即劝返。
The vehicle was not carrying cargo and, after verification by the civilian police, the driver had no place of residence and no clear job in Shanghai, and he was immediately advised to return.
2月11日，G50沪渝高速汾湖检查站，一辆大货车被劝返。
On 11 February, a large lorry was pulled back from the Fen Lake checkpoint at the G50 Shanghai-Chongqing Expressway.
摄影：王煜对于个别的特殊情况，上海的劝返也不是“一刀切”。
Photography: Wang Yu for individual special circumstances, Shanghai's persuasion is not "across the board."
例如，乘车人是来上海搭乘飞机去外地，如果能出示有效的乘机证明信息，民警也会将这样的车辆放行。
For example, if a passenger is travelling to Shanghai on a flight to a foreign country, the police will release such a vehicle if valid flight identification information can be shown.
对于劝返，杨海杰和胡军华都向记者表示：他们理解上海市政府的此项决策是为了减少不必要的人员流动，降低疫情传播的风险。
Both Yang and Hu told reporters that they understood the city government's decision to reduce unnecessary staff movements and reduce the risk of spreading the disease.
正常的复工返沪，这是上海目前所需要的。
A normal return to Shanghai is what Shanghai needs at the moment.
有明确的居住地和工作的入沪人员，对他们的下一步防疫管理就可以落实到相应的社区居委和单位，后者根据入沪人员在“健康云”上填写的信息可以及时联络到每个人，采取相关措施。
The next step in the epidemic prevention administration can be carried out by the residents and units in Shanghai, who can contact everyone and take relevant measures according to the information provided by the residents on the "Health Cloud."
防疫与复工，并不矛盾。
Prevention and resumption of work are not contradictory.
新华社报道：中共中央政治局常务委员会2月12日召开会议，指出“各级党委和政府要实事求是做好防控工作，对偏颇和极端做法要及时纠正，不搞简单化一关了之、一停了之，尽可能减少疫情防控对群众生产生活的影响”。
The Standing Committee of the Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) on Feb. 12 said: "Party committees and governments at all levels should do a good job of prevention and control.
上海的做法，正符合中央的要求。
Shanghai practices are in line with the requirements of the Central Committee.
牢抓细节，热血奉献这次的高速省界检查站查控疫情，任务突如其来、情况瞬息万变，对所有人都是一次严峻考验。
This high-speed provincial border checkpoint to find out the epidemic, the task of sudden, rapidly changing circumstances, is a severe test for all.
1月29日，临近省市突然宣布关闭境内G50高速所有的下匝口，造成上海出口车流量骤增。
On January 29, neighboring provinces and municipalities suddenly announced the closure of all the off-ramps on the G50 within China, causing a sharp increase in Shanghai's export traffic.
当天14时30分起，汾湖检查站的车辆开始积压，最多的时候延绵超过5公里。
From 1430 hours on the same day, vehicles at the Fen Lake checkpoint began to accumulate, extending for up to more than 5 kilometres.
这一突发状况瞬间扰乱了原先的所有部署。
This contingency disrupted all previous deployments in an instant.
站长杨海杰没有慌，他召集了所有正在休息的民警、辅警，让他们紧急全员上岗。
Station master Yang Haijie did not panic, he gathered all the rest of the police, auxiliary police, let them emergency full-time on duty.
很快，8警12辅的所有岗位设置重新安排妥当。
Soon, 8 police 12 auxiliary all the post settings have been rearranged.
9个车道全部开放，前置分流疏导岗2人，初检拦车岗9人，复检引导岗2人，复检区2人，复检区车辆管理岗2人，剩余的3人每人负责3根车道，做好初检拦车岗与复检引导岗之间的信息对接。

在杨海杰的动员下，卫健部门的所有工作人员全员上岗开展防控工作。
In the mobilization of Yang Haijie, all the staff of the health department on duty to carry out prevention and control work.
经过大家的共同努力，19时30分许，车流终于趋于平稳。
Thanks to the concerted efforts of all, the traffic finally levelled off at around 1930 hours.
2月11日，杨海杰（右）在核查入沪车辆。

摄影：王煜杨海杰随身带着两个手机和两个对讲机，在跟《新民周刊》记者介绍情况时，他每隔两三分钟就要停下来接电话或者回复对讲机，全是在处理道口的相关工作事宜。
Photo: Wang Yu Yang Hai-jie with two mobile phones and two walkie-talkies, in a briefing with Xinmin Weekly, he stopped every two or three minutes to answer the phone or answer the walkie-talkie, all dealing with the work related to the intersection.
即使在午餐时间，他也是一手拿着筷子，一手拿着手机，生怕错过了什么信息。
Even at lunchtime, he had chopsticks in one hand and a cell phone in the other, fearing that he might miss something.
连续十四天的道口抗疫工作里，他只回过两次家。
He returned home only twice during the fourteen consecutive days of the epidemic.
在枫泾检查站，现场所有的疫情防控工作细节，站长胡军华总是一遍又一遍地提醒。
At Fengjing Checkpoint, the site of all the details of the disease prevention and control, stationmaster Hu Junhua always reminds again and again.
他说，这些天来不断有新的增援力量上岗，也总是有新的问题需要解决；因此，细节一定要对每个人每个岗位不断地强调，只有每个细节做好了，才可能把整体的“仗”打赢。
'These days there are new reinforcements coming on board, and there are always new problems to be solved; therefore, the details must be constantly emphasized to everyone and every position, and only when every detail is done can the whole "war" be won.
为了压实责任，他还在检查站建立责任倒查机制，如果出现漏检等情况，将通过视频回放把责任追查到具体的个人。
In order to enforce his responsibility, he also established accountability mechanisms at checkpoints, which, in the event of omissions, would be traced to specific individuals through video playback.
2月12日，胡军华在岗位上。
On February 12, Hu Jun Hua took up his post.
摄影：沈琳这并不是胡军华第一次参加抗击疫情的战斗。
Photo: Shen Lin This is not Hu Junhua's first battle against the epidemic.
17年前的SARS疫情期间，他当时还在部队服役，在解放军411医院负责后勤保障工作。
He was in the army 17 years ago during the SARS epidemic, and was in charge of logistics at the 411 Hospital.
他说，那时他只需要专注于自己一个岗位的事情；而现在，他要面临的挑战比那时复杂和困难许多。
At the time, he said, he had to focus on one job; now, the challenges he faced were much more complex and difficult than at the time.
“当时我很年轻，一腔热血义无反顾；现在，我同样责无旁贷。
'I was young and full of blood; and now it is my duty as well.
