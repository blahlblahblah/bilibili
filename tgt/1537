采访&撰稿| 严青排版 |博雅在武汉封城的时候，有一群身患肿瘤的孩子，也因此留在了城里。
AT THE time of his visit to Wuhan, Bo Ya had a group of children with cancer who had stayed in the city.
他们需要面对的不仅是疫情，还有肿瘤治疗中的种种困境。
They have to deal not only with the epidemic, but also with the difficulties of oncology treatment.
从1月23日起到现在，封城已接近一个月的时间。
The city has been closed for nearly a month since January 23.
这些不得不留下的孩子们还好吗？01眼睛里有肿瘤的孩子1岁10个月的彤彤有双一眨一眨的大眼睛，如果忽略左眼里有时出现的那一点白色反光，很难看出她是一个身患肿瘤的孩子。
How are the children who have to stay? 01 with a tumor in her eyes, 1-year-old and 10-month-old child with a double blink, it is difficult to see that she is a child with a tumor if she ignores the white reflex that sometimes appears in her left eye.
彤彤患上的是视网膜母细胞瘤。
What we have today is a retinoblastoma.
这是儿童中最常见的眼部恶性肿瘤，全中国每年大概有1100个孩子不幸患上这种疾病。
It is the most common eye malignancy among children, with about 1,100 children suffering from the disease each year across China.
这种肿瘤会在眼睛里生长，孩子一开始并没有什么感觉，但后期会慢慢失明。
The tumour grows in the eyes and a child does not feel much at first, but slowly becomes blind later in life.
如果不及时治疗，肿瘤最后会慢慢长到眼眶之外，进而扩散到身体其它部位。
If left untreated, the tumor eventually grows out of its orbit and spreads to other parts of the body.
患有视网膜母细胞瘤的孩子，在直视镜头拍照时，瞳孔会出现白色反光（图中左边瞳孔）。

通常，让家长忧心的不是如何治愈，而是孩子是否能保住眼睛——如果错过了保眼治疗的时机，孩子就只能选择摘除眼球来消灭肿瘤，用失去光明的代价来保住生命。
Often, what worries parents is not how to heal, but whether the child can keep his or her eyes - if the opportunity for eye care is missed, the child can only choose to remove his or her eyeball to eliminate the tumor and save his or her life at the cost of losing light.
可是无论是彤彤还是妈妈都没想到，自从1月14日从医院回到武汉黄陂家中，彤彤就再也没能继续接受治疗。
However, neither Tongtong nor his mother had thought that he had never been able to continue treatment since he returned to Huangpi's home in Wuhan on January 14.
在回黄陂过年之前，彤彤在上海接受治疗。
Before returning to Huangpi Spring Festival, Tongtong was treated in Shanghai.
她的肿瘤不是最为严重的分期，也就是说，通过合适的治疗，她可以保住漂亮的大眼睛，可以继续看见妈妈的笑脸，看见她喜欢的游乐园、动画片。
Her tumor is not the most serious stage, that is to say, with the right treatment, she can keep her beautiful eyes, can continue to see her mother's smiling face, see her favorite amusement park, animation.
尽管在来到上海前，彤彤的治疗经历了些波折，但好在上海的治疗还算顺利。
Despite the ups and downs of his treatment before arriving in Shanghai, his treatment in Shanghai was smooth.
彤彤并不像其他孩子那么害怕医院，她喜欢医院里的护士阿姨们。
Tongtong is not as afraid of hospitals as other children. She likes the nurses and aunts in the hospital.
一输完化疗药物，她就下地四处疯跑。
As soon as she finished the chemotherapy medication, she went running around.
要不是因为化疗后开始掉头发，和妈妈一块儿剃了光头，任谁也看不出她是个正在接受肿瘤治疗的孩子。
If she hadn't lost her hair after chemotherapy and shaved off her head with her mother, no one would have seen that she was a child undergoing cancer treatment.
化疗的效果不错，从11月到1月，彤彤的肿瘤得到了控制。
Chemotherapy was effective, and from November to January, a solid tumor was brought under control.
妈妈和医生商量好，等过完年，2月6日，会带彤彤来到上海，继续治疗。
Mom and the doctor agreed to wait until the end of the new year, February 6, will come to Shanghai with Tong Tong, continue treatment.
那时候，谁也没料到，一场席卷全国的疫情，正在悄然蔓延。
At that time, no one expected, a national epidemic, is quietly spreading.
1月23日，武汉封城。

彤彤爸爸回当地农村老家烧香祭祖，正遇上村里封村，就滞留在了村里，至今没能回家。
His father went back to his native village to burn incense offerings. He was met by his village and stayed in the village, but he has not been able to return home.
封城的消息仿佛在彤彤妈妈的心头投下了一颗炸弹，把之前治疗顺利带来的喜悦炸得粉碎。
The news of the siege seemed to have dropped a bomb on his mother's heart, shattering the joy of the previous treatment.
稀薄的希望让她难以呼吸：出城无望，即便能出城，上海那边，也未必会收治来自疫区的孩子。
Her thin hopes made it difficult for her to breathe: there was no hope of going out of town, and even if she could get out of the city, Shanghai might not be able to treat children from affected areas.
彤彤的治疗该怎么办？02当肿瘤遇上疫情武汉的冬天常有阴雨。
What should we do to treat it? 02 When a tumor meets an epidemic situation in Wuhan, it often rains in winter.
街道一日比一日空旷，新型冠状病毒肺炎病人确诊的消息不断传来。
As the streets became more and more empty, the news of the diagnosis of the new coronavirus pneumonia continued to spread.
潮湿的冷空气钻进裤管，寒气似乎快要渗到人的骨头里。
Damp cold air crept into the trouser tube, and the chill seemed to seep into the human bones.
这样的天气里，彤彤妈妈不辞辛苦地往当地医院跑了一趟又一趟。
In such weather, my mother made a strenuous trip to the local hospital one after another.
因为彤彤在上海的主治医生告诉她，建议彤彤在黄陂当地找医院治疗，他可以把彤彤的化疗方案、用药剂量和清单发给当地医生，也可以远程和当地医生进行沟通。
Because Tongtong's doctor in Shanghai told her that he would recommend treating him in a hospital in Huangpi, he could send his chemotherapy plan, dosage and list to the local doctor, and he could communicate with the local doctor remotely.
为着这一线希望，尽管知道疫情期间去医院有风险，彤彤妈妈还是跑遍了附近的医院，希望能找到医生收治自己的女儿。
Despite knowing the dangers of going to the hospital during the outbreak, Tontong went to a nearby hospital hoping to find a doctor to take her daughter in.
可遇上的总是失望。
But I'm always disappointed.
“您家的孩子太小了。
"Your children are too young.
”一位肿瘤科医生客气地说。
"said one oncologist politely.
这家医院原本有3个肿瘤病区，有2个都已经被征用，成了新型冠状病毒肺炎病区，“我们医院收过的最小的孩子也有十岁多，完全没收过这么小的。
Two of the three oncological areas of the hospital have been expropriated for the new coronavirus pneumonia. The youngest child we have ever had in our hospital is over 10 years old and has been completely confiscated
不是说不想帮您，但是这么小的孩子我们实在没经验，要是万一出点什么事，我们也担待不起啊……”怎么办？！脱疗的焦虑时刻啃噬着彤彤妈妈的心。
Not that I don't want to help you, but we really have no experience for such a small child. If anything happens, we can't afford it... "
她不停地刷着各种媒体消息，凡是能看到的，一条也不放过，似乎多了解一点新闻，疫情就能早一天结束，孩子也能早一天恢复治疗。
She kept brushing all kinds of media messages, everything that could be seen, seemed to know more about the news, the outbreak could end the day earlier, and the child could resume treatment the day before.
但疫情的消息一天比一天令人揪心。
But the news of the outbreak is becoming increasingly alarming.
彤彤还小，完全不了解外界发生了什么，她只知道，爸爸一直没有回家，而妈妈再不让她出去玩了。
It was so small that she had no idea what was going on outside. All she knew was that Dad had never been home and that her mother would never let her go out again.
楼下游乐园里，她最喜欢的滑梯空无一人，再没有小朋友和她抢了，可是她却不能出门。
Downstairs in the amusement park, her favorite slide empty, no more children and she robbed, but she can not go out.
图片来源：Unsplash雪上加霜的是，彤彤的PICC管护理，也开始变得艰难。
Source: To add insult to injury, Unsplash's deep PICC care has also begun to get tough.
PICC管是一种特殊材料做的导管，可以将药物从孩子四肢的血管，一直送到身体中央的大静脉。
The PICC tube is a special material made of catheters that carry drugs from the blood vessels of a child's limbs to the great veins in the center of the body.
有了PICC管，孩子静脉注射药物的时候，就不用每次都忍受扎针的痛苦，直接通过PICC管注射就可以了，而且还能减少对外周静脉的刺激。
With the PICC tube, children who inject drugs intravenously do not have to endure the pain of each injection, directly through the PICC tube, but also to reduce peripheral venous stimulation.
所以，很多长期化疗的孩子，都会装上PICC管。
As a result, many children undergoing long-term chemotherapy will be fitted with a PICC tube.
但PICC管也有不方便的地方，其中之一就是要每周维护一次。
But the PICC tube also has inconveniences, one of which is to maintain it once a week.
这种维护可不是在家处理一下就可以的，而是一定要由经过专业训练的护士进行。
This maintenance is not done at home, but must be carried out by professionally trained nurses.
如果不能按时维护，就有感染的风险。
If it is not maintained on time, there is a risk of infection.
而对于免疫力本来就差的肿瘤患儿来说，感染，可能意味着生命危险。
Infection can mean life for a child with a tumour whose immunity is already poor.
每周四是彤彤例行进行PICC管维护的时间。
It is a regular PICC tube maintenance time every Thursday.
彤彤妈妈带着彤彤来到当地的PICC门诊，却看到大门紧闭，上面贴着一张停诊的通知。
Tongtongtong mother came to the local PICC clinic, but saw that the door was closed, with a notice on it.
这是怎么回事？彤彤妈妈怀疑自己眼花了，上次做维护的时候，明明说的是继续开诊呀！她把通知仔仔细细读了好几遍。
How is this? Tongtong mother suspected that she was dazzled, the last time I did maintenance, clearly said to continue to open! She read the notice carefully several times.
没错，停诊，开诊时间待通知。
That's right. Stop. Time to be announced.
03这是战场，我们都要好好的“请帮帮忙，我的孩子急需医院收治！”彤彤妈妈已经记不清自己是第几次发出这样的求助了。
03 This is the battlefield, we should be good "Please help, my child is in urgent need of hospital treatment!" Tontong mother has not remembered how many times she made such a request for help.
各路媒体、各种慈善和公益机构、各家医院……她一个接一个地打着电话，一趟又一趟地出门奔波，一遍又一遍地在网上发布信息，反反复复诉说着彤彤脱疗的困境。
The media, charities, hospitals, one after another, she was on the phone, going out and forth, posting messages on the Internet over and over, over and over again, telling us about our deep unhealed predicament.
彤彤妈妈并不是唯一一个这样做的人，许多脱疗的湖北患儿家长都陷入了同样的焦虑。
Tongtong mother is not the only one to do so, and many parents of children with Hubei who have been untreated are suffering from the same anxiety.
大家私下里交换着消息：“听说这家医院能上疗呢！”“真的吗？”“听说某某医院湖北的一律不收了。
A private exchange of news: "I heard this hospital can be treated!" "Really?" "I heard that the so-called hospital Hubei all do not accept.
”“有人说北京能上疗，不知道真的假的。
"" Some people say Beijing can treat people, but I don't know whether it's true or not.
”……眼下的疫情无疑令人担心，但孩子的肿瘤等得到疫情结束吗？会不会最后等来的是转移或恶化？家长们不敢去想。
... "There is no doubt that the current outbreak is worrying, but is the child's tumour, etc., over? Will it end in a shift or deterioration? Parents are afraid to think.
只能凭着一种近乎本能的力量，四处询问、求助，贪求着每一点可能带来希望的信息。
Only a near-instinctive power, around asking, asking for help, greedily for every possible message of hope.
但绝大多数信息，并没有太多实质性的用处。
But the vast majority of the information is of little substantive use.
彤彤脱疗的日子，依然在一天天延长。
The days of deep healing are still lengthening day by day.
此外，彤彤的PICC管也一直没有维护。
In addition, the Tongtong PICC tube has not been maintained.
这很危险，一旦有害微生物在PICC管里繁殖，这根帮助孩子战胜肿瘤的导管，也许会变成孩子生命的威胁。
This is dangerous, once the harmful microorganisms breed in the PICC tube, a catheter that helps the child overcome the tumor, and may become a threat to the child's life.

图片来源：网络在咨询了彤彤主治医生的看法后，彤彤妈妈终于决定带彤彤去当地医院的住院部，请医生取出彤彤身体里的PICC管。
Photo Source: After consulting our doctor, my mother Tontong finally decided to take us to the hospital of the local hospital and ask the doctor to take out the PICC tube.
拔管时，看着医生和护士娴熟的操作，彤彤妈妈心里忍不住又燃起了一点小小的希翼。
Unplug tube, looking at the doctor and nurse skilled operation, deep in the heart of his mother could not help but ignite a little hope.
她不禁开口：“您这边能拔管的话，可不可以也帮孩子打一下化疗？我们真的没办法了，孩子耽误不起。
She could not help but say: "If you can pull the tube here, can you also help the child chemo? We really can not help, children can not afford to delay.
”“建议您尽量还是少带孩子来我们这儿。
"" I suggest you try to bring fewer children with you.
”医生平和地说。
'said the Doctor quietly.
“为什么呢？”医生的口罩挡住了半张脸，彤彤妈妈看不清他的表情：“我们肿瘤病区确诊了2例新型冠状病毒感染，刚刚转走。
"Why?" The doctor's mask covered half of his face, and his face was deep into his eyes. "We confirmed two new coronavirus infections in the tumor area and have just moved away.
特殊时期，您和孩子还是安全第一……”这话仿佛一记惊雷炸响在彤彤妈妈耳边。
Special time, you and the child or safety first................... as if a thunderbolt blasts in mother's ear.
新型冠状病毒！这段时间她一直惦记着彤彤的肿瘤，几乎忘了自己身在疫区，身边时刻潜伏感染的危险。
The new coronavirus! She had been thinking of her tumour for a long time, almost forgetting that she was in an infected area.
不，她没有忘记，只是从来没有想到过，疫情的危险会离自己、离彤彤如此之近。
No, she did not forget, just never thought that the danger of the epidemic would leave us so close to us.
她想起看到过的新闻：携带者无症状也可能感染其他人，患者可能毫无预兆地转重。
She remembered what she had seen: People with asymptomatic symptoms could also infect others, and patients might turn on their weight without warning.
曾经在报道里看到过的面孔一张张从眼前滑过：那些因病毒而牺牲的医护人员、因过劳而倒下的警务工作者、因病情过重而遗憾离世的患者们……这一刻，彤彤妈妈终于看清了疫情险峻的真面目：这是一场没有硝烟的战争。
The faces that had been seen slipping past our eyes: the health care workers who died of the virus, the police workers who collapsed from overwork, the patients who died of the disease, all of whom died of illness... Tonkin finally saw the true face of the epidemic: a war without smoke.
原来我们每一个人都早已身在战场，而武汉，正是前线。
It turns out that each of us is already in the battlefield, and Wuhan, is the front line.

图片来源：中新网“从那一天起，我就不再想着到处跑、到处找办法求助，找地方收治彤彤了。
From that day on, I stopped thinking about running around looking for help and finding a place to heal.
”彤彤妈妈的声音有种经历挣扎后的平静。
His mother's voice was calm after a struggle.
她开始更多地关注疫情。
She began to pay more attention to the epidemic.
那些因为家人患病而被感染的孩子，还有因为母婴传播而一出生就患上新型冠状病毒肺炎的新生儿，都牵动着她的心。
The children infected by the illness of her family, as well as the new coronavirus pneumonia born as a result of mother-to-child transmission, are touching her heart.
“太不幸了，想起来就觉得很痛心。
"Unfortunately, it hurts to think of it.
”彤彤妈妈说。
"said his mother.
“我想过了，现在是有很多困难。
"I've thought about it. There are a lot of difficulties now.
不过如果我们暂时不治疗，最坏的结果就是彤彤有可能会转移什么的，但是这样都是可以治疗的，只要疫情控制住了，治疗都不是问题。
But if we don't treat it for a while, the worst thing we can do is move something, but it's all curable, and treatment is not a problem as long as the outbreak is under control.
但要是疫情更加严重，甚至我们不幸感染了，那就真的什么希望都没有了。
But if the epidemic gets worse, or even if we are unlucky enough to get infected, there is really no hope.
”“好好做好我们能做的，保护好自己，”彤彤妈妈认真地对我说，“疫情最后肯定会过去的，我们都要好好的。
"Do what we can do well and protect ourselves," Tongtong said earnestly to me. "The epidemic will surely pass in the end.
”图片来源：Unsplash就在发稿前，我们从央视新闻得到了最新消息：为做好疫情期间非新冠肺炎患者医疗救治工作，特别是满足慢性重症患者、孕产妇、儿童、血液透析患者的医疗需求，武汉部分医院将接收非新冠肺炎患者。
Unsplash Just before the release of the article, we received an update from CCTV News that some hospitals in Wuhan would receive patients with non-new crown pneumonia for medical treatment during the outbreak, especially to meet the medical needs of chronically ill patients, pregnant women, children and hemodialysis patients.
其中，武汉儿童医院可接收儿童患者。
Among them, Wuhan Children's Hospital can accept children patients.
这对于留在武汉的肿瘤患儿来说无疑是个好消息。
This is undoubtedly good news for the tumour children who remain in Wuhan.
