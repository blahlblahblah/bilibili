The virus belongs to the incubation period, so we have to make all the preparations and do the loss as well.
”作者 | 第一财经刘佳大年二十七，刚刚从成都回到老家江西准备春节的90后廖佳明，急急忙忙买了一张机票在第二天飞回成都。
Liao Jiaming, the 27-year-old finance minister who has just returned from Chengdu to his hometown of Jiangxi in preparation for the Spring Festival, rushed to buy a ticket and flew back to Chengdu the next day.
原因只有一个——“生产口罩”。
There is only one reason - "make masks."
他是四川恒明医疗器械有限公司（下称“恒明医疗”）的总经理，在成都彭州工厂里，恒明医疗有多条生产相关医疗器械的自动化生产线，医用口罩是其中之一。
He is the general manager of Sichuan Heng Ming Medical Device Co., Ltd. (Heng Ming Medical), one of several automated production lines that produce related medical devices at the factory in Pengzhou, Chengdu.
防止新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情继续扩散，口罩是第一道防护墙。
To prevent the spread of the new coronavirus pneumonia, the mask is the first protective wall.
决定返回成都的当天晚上，廖佳明联系工厂厂长，给返乡过年的工人们一个个打电话，承诺报销车费，工资提到了三倍，争取保证过年期间生产线能够24小时不停地运作。
On the evening of his decision to return to Chengdu, Liao contacted the factory director and telephoned workers returning home for the Lunar New Year, promising to triple their salaries to ensure that production lines could operate 24 hours a day during the Lunar New Year.
第一批生产的医用口罩、手术衣、防护帽等医用物资在紧急消毒解析完成后，恒明医疗决定先用于捐赠援助武汉。
The first batch of medical masks, surgical masks, protective headgear and other medical materials were used in Wuhan after the analysis of emergency disinfection was completed.
此外，过去只在线下销售的恒明医疗，春节期间第一次在天猫平台进行了线上销售，一上午上线的10万只一次性的医用外科口罩很快一售而空。
In addition, Hengming, which used to sell only online, was sold online for the first time during the Spring Festival, and 100,000 disposable medical surgical masks that went online one morning were quickly sold.
目前，恒明医疗生产出的产品服从相关政府部门统一调配，有一部分物资直接供给医院、一线执法人员等。
At present, the products produced by Hengming Medical Service are under the unified deployment of relevant government departments, and some materials are supplied directly to hospitals, front-line law enforcement personnel, etc.
廖佳明告诉第一财经记者，目前工厂实行三班倒，但口罩每天生产量波动较大，约2万只到8万只左右。
Liao told the first financial reporter that the factory now operates on three shifts, but the daily production of masks fluctuates widely, ranging from 20,000 to 80,000.
产量波动背后的原因，一是在于机器超速运转问题，二是在于原材料的供应问题。
The reason behind the fluctuation of output lies in the overspeed operation of machines and the supply of raw materials.
由于生产口罩的机器处于24小时超速运转，机器偶而出现普通工人没有办法解决的问题，于是每一班派出一名技术人员守着机器面前，一旦机器出现问题马上处理。
As the machine that makes the masks overruns around the clock and the machines occasionally have problems that the average worker can't solve, each shift sends a technician to guard the machines and deal with them as soon as they go wrong.
出于对疫情形势的判断，恒明医疗决定继续采购机器并增加更多生产线，但没想到，口罩机器也涨价了。
Judging by the epidemic, Heng Ming decided to continue purchasing machines and adding more production lines, but unexpectedly, the price of masks and machines also went up.
之前一台生产口罩机器的采购价格在18万左右，现在两天涨了6万左右，“前两天我们买了订了两台，涨到了24万；今天再问已经到了29万、30万。
The purchase price of a mask-making machine used to be about 180,000, but now it's up about 60,000 a day. "We bought two of them the other day and they went up to 240,000; today we have 290,000, 300,000.
”除了机器维护和采购成本外，工厂面临的另一个困难是原材料供应短缺。
In addition to the cost of machine maintenance and procurement, another difficulty for factories is a shortage of raw materials.
从口罩面层用的纺粘无纺布材料到口罩的芯体部分材料熔喷无纺布，再到鼻夹、挂绳，都呈现不同程度的短缺和成本上涨。
From the viscous non-woven material on the mask surface to the core of the mask, the melt-blown non-woven fabric, to the nose clip, hanging rope, there are varying degrees of shortages and cost increases.
廖佳明说，春节期间，口罩整体原材料价格整体上涨约50%，每一天还在上涨。
During the Spring Festival, the overall cost of raw materials for masks rose about 50 percent, with prices rising daily, Liao said.
不过，也有一些供应商仗义地选择不涨价，甚至降价供应。
However, there are also a number of suppliers generously choose not to increase prices, or even supply at reduced prices.
事实上，口罩利润并不算大，特殊时期再加上人工开支、原材料成本、物流成本的提高，企业利润被进一步削薄。
In fact, the mask is not very profitable, the special period plus labor costs, raw material costs, logistics costs increased, corporate profits were further reduced.
廖佳明表示，口罩不涨价，调配的口罩物资目前无偿供应，不用计算一定亏钱，但大家现在所有的心思放在抗击疫情上，“病毒属于潜伏期，我们要做好全部的准备，亏钱也要做。
Liao said the mask prices do not rise, the deployment of masks materials are currently free supply, do not have to calculate the loss of money, but all the attention is now focused on fighting the epidemic, "the virus is a latency period, we have to do all the preparation, loss of money to do.
”遗憾的是，因为生产的波动性等多重原因，恒明医疗在天猫销售的部分口罩未能如期发货，正面临不少用户投诉。
Unfortunately, some of the masks sold by Hang Ming Medical in Tiantas have not been delivered as scheduled due to, among other factors, the volatility of production, and are facing a number of user complaints.
按照廖佳明预计，因为投诉等原因，仅线上平台算下来可能要赔付不少。
According to Liao Jiaming, due to complaints and other reasons, just online platform calculation may have to pay a lot.
不过，今日阿里巴巴方面人士告诉记者，对于商家优先供应武汉抗疫情一线的订单，平台将与商家沟通核实，予以免责；消费者的退款正在推进，有平台进行兜底。
However, today, Alibaba told reporters that the business priority to supply Wuhan anti-epidemic first-line orders, the platform will communicate with businesses to verify that the exemption; consumer refund is being promoted, there is a platform for bottom-up.
为了及时支持与高效服务抗疫企业，在口罩工厂紧锣密鼓生产的同时，当地政府部门派出专项工作组，采取一对一服务方式入驻工厂，协调解决企业原料供应、员工组织、物流运输、设备采购中的具体困难，帮助企业全力做好口罩等防控应急物资生产。
In order to provide timely support and efficient services to combat epidemic enterprises, local government departments have dispatched special teams to enter factories on a one-to-one basis to solve specific difficulties in the supply of raw materials, staff organization, logistics and equipment procurement, and to help enterprises make full efforts to prevent and control the production of emergency masks.
廖佳明告诉记者，有关部门专门派出4~6人的工作班子，每天驻扎在恒明医疗的工厂里，随时帮助企业解决实际生产碰到的问题，例如原材料出现短缺，政府派驻工厂的工作组帮忙在省内以及跨省广泛联系，牵线对接供应商，让生产减少后顾之忧。
Liao told reporters that the departments concerned sent 4 to 6 people to the factory to help enterprises solve practical problems, such as shortages of raw materials.
特别是在政府部门了解到工厂不计成本采购机器加速生产口罩物资的做法，承诺表示一定想办法为企业申请补上差价。
In particular, the government, aware of the factory's cost-free purchasing machinery to speed up the production of masks, promised to show that it must find a way to make up for the difference.
此外，面对工厂一定程度上的资金周转压力，廖佳明透露，银行相关人员快速在一线实地了解企业生产经营情况及融资需求，现场为企业制定专属金融服务方案，给予特别利率优惠并减免相关手续费用，恒明医疗在银行申请的100万的贷款， 48小时之内就完成了贷款发放。
In addition, faced with a certain amount of cash flow pressure from the factory, Liao Jiaming revealed that the relevant bank personnel quickly learned about the production and operation of the enterprises and their financing needs on the spot.
在采访快结束时，廖佳明告诉记者，自己家里有5口人，但只有不超过10个口罩的存货，每天只有一人外出进行家庭采买。
At the end of the interview, Liao told reporters that there were five people in his family, but only a stock of up to 10 masks.
他呼吁，对于普通人来说，最好的防护就是尽量少出门；在口罩物资紧张的情况下，这样能够为一线的工作人员留出更多防护用品。
The best protection for ordinary people, he says, is to go out as little as possible, so that more supplies can be set aside for front-line workers in situations where masks are in short supply.
