澎湃新闻记者 高宇婷 马作鹏 实习生 李彤3月6日，武汉的新冠肺炎新增确诊病例自1月27日以来首度降至两位数，距离武汉封城，过去了44天。
A new confirmed case of pneumonia in Wuhan has fallen to double digits for the first time since January 27, 44 days after the city was closed in Wuhan.
根据湖北省卫健委3月7日发布的数据，截至3月6日24时，湖北新增新冠肺炎确诊病例74例，其中：武汉市74例，其他16个市州均为0例。
As of 2400 hours on March 6, 74 new cases of pneumonia had been confirmed in Hubei Province, 74 of which were in Wuhan and none in the other 16 cities and counties, according to data released March 7 by the Hubei Provincial Health Committee.
这是武汉新冠肺炎疫情自1月27日以来，日新增确诊病例首度降至两位数。
This is Wuhan new crown pneumonia outbreak since January 27, the first day of new confirmed cases fell to double-digit.
此外，根据湖北省卫健委3月5日、6日的数据，3月6日武汉新增确诊病例较上日减少了52例。
On March 6, there were 52 fewer confirmed cases in Wuhan than on the previous day, according to data from the Hubei Wei Jiancommittee March 5 and 6.
数字正在发生变化，而数字背后疫情防控态势向好的原因又有哪些？3月7日下午，国家卫健委医管中心主任王健接受澎湃新闻采访时表示，武汉新增确诊病例下降，是“应收尽收，应治尽治”起了效果。
In an interview with Peng Pai News on the afternoon of March 7, Wang Jian, director of the National Center of Health Care and Administration, said the decline in the number of newly diagnosed cases in Wuhan was "the best we can receive and cure."
“通过应收尽收，应治尽治，我们把病人从家里面都找到以后进行收治，控制了传染源，切断了传播途径，还保护了易感人群。
"By collecting what is due and treating it, we find patients inside their homes and treat them, control the source of infection, cut off transmission routes and protect vulnerable populations.
人不传人了，病人不再传染了，数字就下来了。
People no longer transmit, patients no longer infected, the number down.
再者，现在建了这么多方舱医院、定点医院，几万张床位就是干这个活，现在成效显现了。
In addition, so many square-cabin hospitals, designated hospitals, tens of thousands of beds to do this work, the results are now evident.
”澎湃新闻梳理后发现，方舱医院建成投入使用、“四类人员”应收尽收刻不容缓、检测能力提高疑似病例减少，全国4万多名医护人员支援武汉……一系列措施助力武汉新冠肺炎新增确诊人数降至两位数以内。
"After a thorough grooming of the news, it was found that the construction of the Fang Cao Hospital, the" four categories of personnel "should be collected without delay, the ability to improve the detection capacity of suspected cases decreased, more than 40,000 medical personnel supported Wuhan.
迎接挑战，推进方舱医院建设方舱医院的建设，改变了武汉新冠肺炎的医疗模式，加速了对患者的收治，减缓了病情的蔓延。
To meet the challenge of advancing the construction of the square cabin hospital, Wuhan Xinguan Pneumonia changed the medical model, accelerated the admission of patients, slowed the spread of the disease.
方舱医院，顾名思义是一个临时的医疗救护场所。
The Fang Cavern Hospital, by definition, is a temporary medical aid facility.
疫情来袭，居家或者在宾馆隔离治疗的轻症病人由于没有医护在身边，在有效隔离和疾病诊疗上存在不足，而方舱医院的建立就在解决这些问题。
The establishment of the Fang Cathedral Hospital was one of the solutions to the epidemic and the lack of effective isolation and disease diagnosis and treatment for light cases treated at home or in hotels due to the lack of medical attention.
2月3日，武汉连夜开建洪山体育馆、武汉客厅、武汉国际会展中心首批三处“方舱医院”。
February 3, Wuhan night began to build Hongshan Stadium, Wuhan living room, Wuhan International Convention and Exhibition Center, the first three "cabin hospitals.
2月5日，武汉市已经改造完成和正在改造的“方舱医院”包括洪山体育馆、武汉客厅、武汉国际会展中心等13处，预计可提供万余张床位。
On February 5, Wuhan city has completed the transformation and is in the process of renovation of the "Fang Cao Hospital" including Hongshan Stadium, Wuhan sitting room, Wuhan International Convention and Exhibition Center, and other 13 places, which are expected to provide more than 10,000 beds.
至2月22日24时，武汉共有16家方舱医院正在运行，在国家卫健委接管的其中14家方舱医院中，剩余床位3千多张。
As of 2400 hours on February 22, Wuhan had 16 Fangzhou hospitals in operation, of which 14 were taken over by the State Sanitarium, with more than 3,000 beds remaining.
3月1日，硚口武体方舱成为武汉首个休舱方舱医院。
On March 1, Zhangkou Wushi Square became the first cabin hospital in Wuhan.
截至3月6日，武汉还有13家方舱医院开放，剩余患者2000余人。
As of March 6, Wuhan still has 13 cabin hospitals open, the remaining patients more than 2,000 people.
3月6日下午，在国务院新闻办在于湖北武汉举行的第六场前线发布活动上，中央指导组成员、国务院副秘书长丁向阳讲道，疫情高峰时，武汉每天有3000多例患者的病床需求，“这对世界上任何一个城市来说都是挑战。
"At the height of the epidemic, Wuhan had more than 3,000 hospital beds a day," said Ding Xiangyang, a member of the Central Steering Committee and Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council, at the sixth front-line launch event held in Wuhan, Hubei Province.
”但当时武汉市只有两家传染病医院，病床最多不超过1000张，一床难求、患者住不上院的问题，是当时最头疼、最急迫的事。
But there were only two hospitals for infectious diseases in Wuhan, with a maximum of 1,000 beds, and one bed was hard to get and patients could not live in the upper house.
“我们当时一手抓医院建设，一手抓方舱医院建设，每天都以增加3000张床的速度往前推进，最终建成86家定点医院，16家方舱医院，完成了6万多张床位，满足了每一个时段患者救治床位的需求。
"With one hand on the construction of the hospital and the other on the construction of the Fang Cao Hospital, we were able to make headway every day with the addition of 3,000 beds, and eventually built 86 designated hospitals and 16 square-cabin hospitals, with more than 60,000 beds available to meet the needs of patients at all times.
”丁向阳感叹，一个月之间，在武汉建设完成60家相当于三甲医院数量的病床，是何等艰难而又叹为观止的工程量，“没有中央统一集中的领导，没有全国各地的支持，这是不可能完成的任务。
"Without centralized central leadership and support from all over the country, it would be impossible to accomplish the task of building 60 hospital beds in Wuhan in a month," he said.
”应收尽收，实现“床等人”床位是制约“应收尽收”的最大障碍。
"Receivable, the realization of" bed and so on "bed is the biggest obstacle to the" receivable ".
医院、方舱和隔离点实现“床等人”，才能解决巨大的就医需求，构成疫情防控的堡垒。
The hospital, the square cabin and the isolation point realize the "bed and so on", can solve the huge demand for medical treatment, constitute the fort of disease prevention and control.

On March 2, about 20,000 patients were admitted to hospital in the 10 days since the battle against corruption began on February 9, according to Weixin official "An Jian, chief of the CPPCC."
到了2月21日起基本实现了“床等病人”。
By February 21, the basic realization of "bed and other patients."
目前床位已实现富余供给，完全可以满足应收尽收、应治尽治、应隔尽隔的要求。
At present, the bed has realized the surplus supply, can fully meet the receivable, should be treated, should be separated by the requirements.
床位出现积极变化，意味着“应收尽收”“应治尽治”有了根本保障，现在，武汉的疫情防控也出现了正面信号。
The positive change in bed space means that the "receivable" and "curable" has a fundamental guarantee, now, Wuhan's disease prevention and control also appeared positive signals.
除了床位得到保障，核酸检测能力与全国各地医疗队的支援保障也成了武汉市抗击疫情的关键助力。
In addition to the guaranteed beds, nucleic acid detection capacity and medical teams around the country to support the support of Wuhan City has become the key to fighting the epidemic.
目前，核酸检测能力从每天300人份提高到2万人份，采样送检到反馈结果的时间从2天缩短到4个小时，基本做到应检尽检，有力推动了救治关口前移，提高了抗疫工作主动性。
