燃财经（ID:rancaijing）原创作者 | 金玙璠 苏琦编辑 | 魏佳此前，国务院下发通知将春节假期延长至2月2日，今天是假期结束后的第一个工作日。
Flaming Finance (ID: Rancaijing) Former creator and writer Su Qi of the Jinzhou Fan has previously been notified by the State Council to extend the Spring Festival holiday to February 2, the first working day after the holiday.
为了减少人群聚集，防止交叉感染，不少互联网企业选择于2月3日至2月7日让员工在家办公。
To reduce crowds and prevent cross-infection, many Internet companies chose to let their employees work from home from February 3 to February 7.
“在家办公”虽然早在上世纪80年代就在硅谷流行，但在国内一直不温不火，疫情之后，这种方式会昙花一现，还是有可能成为未来企业办公的主流方式？多名受访者告诉燃财经，2003年的非典疫情过后，阿里巴巴、京东等电子商务公司顺风而起，而这一次全民打响的防疫战或倒逼企业采用数字化、移动化办公方式，以在疫情期间免费开放办公软件的腾讯、阿里巴巴、字节跳动为例，这些企业的新动作有望拉动远程办公行业的爆发式增长，带动整个市场逆势上扬。
While working from home has been popular in Silicon Valley since the 1980s, it has been tepid at home, a flash point in the wake of the epidemic, or a potential mainstay of future office works.Several interviewees told Flaming Finance that after the SARS epidemic in 2003, Alibaba, Jing Dong and other e-commerce companies had followed suit.
不过，目前“在家办公”协同软件主要分为沟通IM、文档协作、视频会议/面试、任务管理四个主要类别，多以单品能力突出，怎样集成协同是个问题，另外，如何保护数据隐私是企业用户最关注的问题。
However, at present, there are four main types of collaborative software: communication IM, file collaboration, video conference / interview and task management.
对于更大范围的企业管理者和员工而言，与防范疫情同等重要的挑战是，在社会大面积延期返工的状态下，如何利用远程协作工具实现高效“在家办公”。
An equally important challenge for managers and employees more broadly is how to use remote collaboration tools to "work from home" efficiently when society delays rework on a large scale.
疫情下的“全民SOHO”在家办公，在国外的名字叫SOHO（Small Office，Home Office），一度是个十分时髦的概念。
The idea of "SOHO for All" working from home, known abroad as the Small Office (Home Office), was once a very fashionable concept.
早在上世纪80年代，IBM就开始在员工家里设立“远程工作站”。
Back in the 1980s, IBM began setting up 'remote workstations' in employees' homes.
2017年前后的数据统计显示，IBM有将近40%的雇员都是SOHO一族。
Around 2017, IBM has nearly 40% of its employees in the SOHO category.
在IBM之后，Google、Facebook、Yahoo等一众硅谷巨头也加入了SOHO办公阵营。
After IBM, Google, Facebook, Yahoo and other Silicon Valley giants joined the SOHO camp.
企业节省费用，员工得到自由，这种办公方式在全球越来越受欢迎。
Businesses are cutting costs, employees are free, and this office is becoming more and more popular around the world.
2020年这场肺炎疫情，也让SOHO成了不少企业，尤其是互联网公司被动却最实在的选择。
In 2020, this outbreak of pneumonia, SOHO has become a lot of enterprises, especially the Internet companies passive but the most realistic choice.
国家规定假期延长至2月2日，地方陆续通知延迟复工，上海、浙江、广东、北京等地方陆续发布通知，要求除必需行业外，各企业2月10日上班。
The state extended the holiday until February 2, and local authorities have delayed the resumption of work, issuing notices in places including Shanghai, Zhejiang, Guangdong and Beijing requiring companies to start work on February 10, in addition to essential trades.
疫情当前，自我隔离式的办公方式成为企业和员工双方的最优解，国内为“在家办公”提供服务的公司，也迎来了新机会。
With the outbreak, self-segregation is the best solution for both companies and employees, and new opportunities are opening up for home-based companies.
市面上的远程协同办公软件主要分为沟通IM、文档协作、视频会议/面试、任务管理四个主要类别，部分公司基于既有产品，在疫情期间针对“在家办公”推出了一些新功能，具体以升级原有功能、上线健康相关板块、免费开放为主。
There are four main categories of telecommuting software on the market: IM, file collaboration, videoconferencing / interview and task management. Some companies have introduced new features for "telecommuting" during the epidemic, based on existing products.
企业微信：疫情期间，会议人数上限升级至300人，支持随时随地发起音视频会议。
Corporate messaging: During the epidemic, the conference ceiling was raised to 300 people, supporting the launch of audio and video conferences anytime, anywhere.

Flying Books: Until May 1, 2020, users will have free access to unlimited video and audio conferencing, open-ended online files and forms, and approval management.
同时上线“健康管理”服务，并向学校、企业等组织免费开放。
At the same time on-line "health management" services, and open to schools, enterprises and other organizations free of charge.
小鱼易连：疫情期间，小鱼易连向全国政府机关、医疗机构、教育机构、企业单位免费提供100方云视频会议。
Small fish Yi Lian: During the epidemic period, small fish easy to connect to the national government organs, medical institutions, educational institutions, business units free of charge to provide 100-square-cloud videoconference.
使用小鱼App可通过微信、短信或邮件等方式向同事发出会议邀请，快速组成视频会议，相关成员输入号码即可加入会议。
Using App, a small fish, you can send a meeting invitation to your colleagues by way of micromail, text message or email. Videoconferencing can be organized quickly and the members concerned can join the meeting by typing a number.
用户还可录制视频会议，会后分享或反复观看。
Users can also record videoconferences and share or watch them repeatedly after a session.
石墨文档：开放远程办公版、不限席位；针对疫情需要的政府组织/志愿者组织，企业版在这段时间内不收取任何费用；针对初次使用的企业设计了一些基础模板：例如会议记录、项目进度表、财务管理等。
Graphite files: Open telecommuting, open-ended; for government / volunteer organizations responding to the epidemic, the enterprise version does not charge any fees during this period; some basic templates are designed for first-time users: meeting records, project schedules, financial management, etc.
这一赛道中不乏巨头身影，阿里的钉钉、腾讯的企业微信、字节跳动的飞书已拥有大批用户，石墨文档、小鱼易连等创业型公司也曾获得上亿人民币融资。
The track has a number of giant figures, Ali's nail, Tencent's corporate micro-letter, byte jumping books have a large number of users, graphite documents, small fish Yi Lian and other start-up companies have received hundreds of millions of yuan in financing.
制图 / 燃财经随着企业数字化程度提升，移动办公市场规模也在不断增长。
Graphic / combustible finance As the level of digitization increases, so does the size of the mobile office market.
据华泰证券研究所和海比研究数据显示，2012年、2017年国内移动办公市场规模分别为53.7亿元、194.4亿元，2020年市场规模预计将达到478.3亿元。
According to Huatai Securities Institute and Haibi Research data, the domestic mobile office market size in 2012 and 2017 is 5.37 billion yuan and 19.44 billion yuan, respectively, and the market size is expected to reach 47.83 billion yuan in 2020.
细分场景将迎来新机会一直以来，在家办公只是作为辅助功能出现，在这次疫情之下，在家办公能借势爆发吗？易观分析师孙梦子告诉燃财经，2020年的这一场新型冠状肺炎病毒疫情，倒逼企业短期内在家办公，从长期来看，将推动整个远程办公行业向纵深发展。
(Sun Mengzi) (Sun Mengzi) (Sun Mengzi) (Sun Mengzi) (Sun Mengzi) (Sun Mengzi) (Sun Mengzi) The 2020 outbreak of the new coronary pneumonia virus pushes companies to work from home in the short term, driving the telecommuting industry further into the future.
首先是疫情之下被迫在家办公的企业，开始反思对数字化的重视程度。
First, companies forced to work from home under the epidemic began to reflect on the importance of digitalization.
多数行业目前已经有了一定的数字化基础，疫情过后，企业主便会加快数字化转型的步伐，水涨船高，提供数字化服务的下游to B 企业会迎来快速增长期。
Most industries now have a certain amount of digital foundation, after the epidemic, entrepreneurs will speed up the pace of digital transformation, rising, providing digital services downstream to B enterprises will usher in a period of rapid growth.
第二波机会则属于协同办公中的各个主流细分场景。
The second wave of opportunities belongs to the various mainstream subdivisions of the co-work scene.
一位协作产品负责人对燃财经表示，目前国内的云协作产品，多以单品能力突出，如文档功能或音视频会议功能、或单独的IM功能。
A co-product owner told Burning Finance that the current domestic cloud collaboration products, such as documents or audio and video conferencing capabilities, or separate IM functions.
推出海纳视频面试的群星科技是一家30人规模的初创企业，其创始人梁公军告诉燃财经，为了实现在家办公，目前公司使用着多个应用，内部沟通和客户沟通主要用微信和企业微信，工作文档则放在Tower、Teambition、石墨文档这类在线工具上。
Liang Gongjun, founder of Haina Video Interview, a 30-person start-up, told Caijing that the company uses multiple applications to work from home, with internal communications and customer communications using micromail and corporate messaging, and work files on online tools such as Power, Teambion and Graphite Documentation.
企业远程办公基于多元的工作场景，如即时通讯、协同文档、在线会议、云盘以及客户管理、合同管理、员工培训等，均需要对应的协同功能。
Telecommuting in an enterprise is based on multiple work scenarios, such as instant messaging, collaborative documentation, online meetings, cloud discs, and customer management, contract management, and staff training, all requiring corresponding synergies.
图 /视觉中国孙梦子表示，行业里任一细分应用场景背后都会是一个巨大的市场，会吸引N多个供应商入局，提供支撑企业各种运转场景的工具。
Graph / Vision China Sun Mengzi says that behind any segment of the industry, there will be a huge market, attracting more than N suppliers and providing the tools to support a variety of business scenarios.
而这个“窗口期”过后，各个细分协同办公领域将会呈现出一个相对清晰的竞争格局。
And after this "window period", each subdivision office field will present a relatively clear competition pattern.
“但也不会像消费互联网，形成老大老二通吃天下，老三老四老五喝汤，老五以后全部死掉的格局。
"But will not be like the consumption of the Internet, forming the eldest two eat the world, old three old four old five drink soup, after five all dead patterns.
”梁公军形容。
Liang described it.
“在疫情期间，用户选择哪个产品，主要是看谁能真正帮助他在办公时提效。
"During an epidemic, the user selects which product to use, primarily to see who can really help him or her improve performance while on the job.
”石墨文档市场负责人刘丛礼对燃财经表示，至于新增用户能否留存，暂时还无法预估，留存除了和产品本身有关之外，还与使用场景有关，从远程办公回到办公室集合办公之后，使用习惯、企业主的决策都会影响用户的去留。
Liu Cong-li, head of graphite file marketing, told Flammac that it was too early to predict whether the new users would be retained. In addition to the product itself, the retention would be related to the usage scenario, which would be affected by usage habits and business owners' decisions when returning to the office from telecommuting.
当企业主眼下最迫切的“痛点”解决后，第三波机会在企业用人方面。
When business owners "most pressing" pain point "is resolved, the third wave of opportunities in the corporate workforce.
孙梦子称，尤其对于中小型企业来说，今年用人难、用人成本高的问题将更加严峻，企业主对灵活用工的需求将明显增加，为企业提供灵活用工、随需随聘解决方案的企业将高速发展。
Especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, the problem of employing difficult and costly will be more serious this year, said Sun. The demand for flexible jobs will increase markedly, and enterprises that provide flexible employment and on-demand solutions will grow rapidly.
这将加速传统雇佣关系的瓦解，企业用人开始从雇佣关系转换到合作关系。
This will accelerate the breakdown of traditional employment relationships, and employers will begin to shift from employment relationships to partnerships.
“数据隐私”是最大痛点虽然各地企业主不得不加入协同办公软件的客户表，然而对于远程办公行业人士而言，仍然有一场硬仗要打。
"Data privacy" is the biggest pain point: While business owners everywhere have to join the OCS client list, there is still a hard fight for telecommuters.
据前瞻产业研究院统计，2018年，中国企业智能移动办公投入结构分别为移动应用建设与开发投入46%、移动办公相关服务20%，其他投入20%，移动安全投入仅占14%，信息安全投入略显不足，移动应用的信息安全建设仍是重中之重。
According to the Institute for Advanced Industrial Research, in 2018, China's enterprises will invest 46 percent in mobile application construction and development, 20 percent in mobile office-related services, 20 percent in other input, only 14 percent in mobile security, and information security investment in mobile applications is still a top priority.
梁公军的另一个身份是太极资本创始人，他认为，数据隐私保护是企业用户当前最核心的关注点。
Liang, another founder of Taiji Capital, believes that data privacy protection is the most central concern of enterprise users.
图 / Pexels石墨文档从去年开始发力B端的商业化，在过程中重点采集了企业用户使用远程协作软件的痛点。
Figure / Pexels Graphite documents have been commercialized since last year, focusing on the pain of corporate users using remote collaboration software.
首先是安全问题。
The first is security.
刘丛礼介绍了石墨文档在三个重点环节做的工作。
Liu Congli introduced the work of graphite document in three key links.
在存储方面，将用户数据保存至阿里云，如果客户所处的行业极度需要保密，也可以选择定制版本，将资料部署在自有的服务器上；在基层结构上，从文件、文件夹到团队空间（类似于企业云盘），每一层都可设置不同的权限，从上往下逐级开放，便于企业管理；在离职交接方面，石墨文档专门设置了一键交接文件归属权的功能，避免了文件泄露的尴尬。
On the storage side, save user data to Ariyun, or select custom versions to deploy the data on its own servers if the client's industry is in dire need of confidentiality; on the base structure, each layer can set different permissions, from files, folders to team spaces (similar to corporate cloud disks); and graphite files feature one-button handover of documents to avoid embarrassing document leaks.
对于安全问题，国外已经有了另一套成熟的思路。
For security issues, foreign countries have another set of mature thinking.
硅谷工程师Edward告诉燃财经，国内的公司更加强调内网的概念，但是这样的危险之处在于，如果内网被入侵了，那就意味着入侵者可以借机得到大量额外的权限，为了确保安全，公司就需要把大量精力放在保证内网不被入侵上，即便如此，风险依然存在，一般大公司都有成千上万台电脑，难保不出问题。
Edward, an engineer in Silicon Valley, tells Burning Finance that domestic companies are putting more emphasis on the intranet concept, but the danger is that if the intranet is breached, it means the intruder can borrow a lot of extra permissions.
而目前国外最新的思路是淘汰内部办公网，将所有的核心资源放在云上，员工可在家访问，可在公司内部访问，访问权限不再以网络环境区分，而是以用户身份认证的过程区分。
At present, the latest foreign thinking is to eliminate the internal office network, put all the core resources on the cloud, employees can visit at home, can visit within the company, access rights are no longer differentiated by network environment, but by the process of user authentication.
当然前提是，企业需要确保所有数据可追溯、可审计。
This presupposes, of course, that the enterprise needs to ensure that all data are traceable and auditable.
举个例子，如果员工在家访问了公司资源，一旦发生数据泄漏，企业需具备可溯源查证数据泄露始末的能力。
For example, if an employee visits the company's resources at home, in the event of a data leak, the company needs to be able to trace back to the beginning and end of the data leak.
Edward补充说，硅谷常用的在线协作软件有Google Apps、Office 365、Slack等，但对于即时沟通软件，很多大公司禁止使用外部的此类应用，选择开发自家的工具，比如Google就用Hangouts，微软就用Microsoft Teams等。
Edward adds that Google Apps, Office 365 and Slack are some of the most popular online collaborations in Silicon Valley, but for instant-messaging software, many big companies prohibit the use of outside apps and choose to develop their own tools, such as Google with Hangouts and Microsoft Teams and others.
在美国，员工在家办公也是承担着风险的。
Working from home is also risky in the United States.
Edward表示，很多在美国工作的人拿的是美国签证，这些人从法律上来讲是不能在家工作的。
Edward says many of the people who work in the United States receive visas from the United States and are not legally able to work from home.
工作签证上明确要求必须在指定地点、指定时间工作，当然公司也会尽量避免员工不小心违反这些规定。
Working visas clearly require working at a designated time and place, although companies will try to avoid inadvertent violations.
再者是集成问题。
Then there is the integration problem.
在充分竞争的市场环境下，产品同质化是行业绕不开的问题。
In the fully competitive market environment, product homogenization is an unavoidable issue for the industry.
刘丛礼称，很多企业都有自己的OA系统，都希望外来的软件能集成到自身的OA系统中，便于员工一站式使用，不用来回切换。
'Many companies have their own OA systems, 'Mr. Liu said.' They want foreign software to be integrated into their OA systems so they can be used as a one-stop shop for employees.
对于集成问题，人民数字科技产业有限公司常务副总经理张国君给出了相同的建议，市场不是非此即彼的零和游戏，很多OA系统用的仍然是一些通用性软件，线上协作工具可在专业性和定制化上下功夫，做现有OA的“伴侣”。
Zhang Guojun, executive vice president of People's Digital Technology Industry Co., Ltd., made the same suggestion. The market is not an either-or-nothing zero-sum game. Many OA systems still use generic software, and online collaboration tools can work professionally and customarily to be "partners" with existing OAs.
张国君称，大企业技术比较先进，生态比较完整，需要更重视小组织的用户体验和需求；小企业更具特色，需要具备更强的扩展性，强化与商业化程度的软件的打通。
Zhang Guojun said that large enterprises are more advanced in technology and more integrated in ecology. They need to pay more attention to the user experience and needs of small organizations.
多位业内人士均表示，远程办公会成为一大趋势，受此次疫情影响，行业中大小企业都有机会，但从很长一段时间来看，远程办公只是作为集中办公的补充，不会成为主流。
A number of industry insiders said telecommuting would be a major trend and that companies, large and small, would have opportunities due to the epidemic, but for a long time telecommuting would only be a complement to, and not a mainstay of, a centralized office.
如何推进在家办公？能否在家办公，受行业类型影响最大。
How to promote home-based work? Can work from home, by the type of industry most affected.
2月2日，针对此次疫情对于节后复工等方面的影响，智联招聘进行的调研数据报告结果显示，互联网企业在家办公占比最高，各行业中，企业采取在家办公措施占比最高是IT/通信/电子/互联网占比32.1%，其次为商业服务占比28.3%。
On February 2, a survey conducted by JFSU to measure the impact of the epidemic on post-holiday work showed that Internet companies had the highest proportion of home-based businesses, with 32.1 per cent of businesses adopting home-based measures, followed by business services with 28.3 per cent.
来源 / 智联招聘数据报告对此，梁公军表示，互联网相关行业里，如互联网工程师、编辑记者、市场、销售，创意类行业如设计，以及律师这类脑力劳动者都适合在家办公。
According to the source / think tank recruitment data report, Internet-related industries such as Internet engineers, editorial reporters, markets, sales, creative industries such as design, and intellectual workers such as lawyers are well suited to work from home, he said.
孙梦子认为，适合在家办公的行业，一定是数字化程度较高的行业，如科技互联网、信息技术、媒体等线上业务流程相对成熟的行业，因为企业中具备强替代性、强文档性或者强规范性的工作内容，都比较容易被搬运到线上。
Sun Mengzi believes that the appropriate home-office industry must be more digitally advanced industries, such as the Internet, information technology, media and other industries with relatively mature business processes, because enterprises with strong substitutability, strong documentation or strong normative work content are more easily moved to the line.
那么，如何落地在家办公呢？某互联网大厂员工对燃财经表示，他接到通知从2月3日至10日在家办公。
So how does it land at home? A large internet factory employee told Flaming Finance that he was told to work from February 3 to 10 at home.
此前他已远程办公一年，从员工的视角，他认为这种方式节省时间，但领导会有不同的想法。
He had been telecommuting for a year, and from an employee's point of view, he thought it would save time, but the leader would have a different idea.
他的领导多次表示，当面沟通效率更高，对于一些重要事件，曾要求他出差当面汇报，平时也要求写日报、周报，每一项工作的进度都会被严格“监督”，以把控进度。
His leadership has repeatedly said that face-to-face communication is more efficient, that he has been asked to travel to face-to-face briefings on important events and that daily and weekly newspapers are routinely required, and that the progress of each task is strictly "monitored" to keep pace.
管理和沟通效率，是企业管理者最不放心的两个问题。
Management and communication efficiency are the two most insecure issues for managers.
梁公军建议企业管理者，首先，在家办公也要加强定期沟通，以一定的会议制度来保障沟通频率和效率。
Liang Gongjun suggested that enterprise managers, first of all, work from home should also strengthen regular communication, with a certain meeting system to ensure the frequency and efficiency of communication.
如果是对员工行为规范/工作流程控制较严的团队，可以用钉钉、企业微信。
If it is a team with strict control over employee behavior / workflow, you can use nail, enterprise micro-letter.
其次，一定要把目标拆解为任务，把公司一段时间内的目标，拆解到每一天，对每一项任务责任到人、明确到小时、明确提交物的规范和要求。
Second, it is important to break down goals into tasks, break down the goals of the company over a period of time, and define the norms and requirements for each task, from person to person, from clarity to hour, to clarity of submission.
孙梦子建议，企业管理者多使用线上协作工具。
Enterprise managers should make more use of online collaboration tools, Sun suggested.
在此次疫情之前，市面上的远程软件已经能够满足绝大多数企业的需求，但没有得到充分利用，很多企业对企业微信、钉钉的使用，基本停留在考勤等管控而非协同的功能上。
Before the outbreak, remote software on the market had been able to meet the needs of the vast majority of enterprises, but not fully utilized, many enterprises micro-letter, nail use, basically stay in attendance and other control rather than coordination of the function.
她建议企业主详细了解远程办公软件，把能够搬运到线上的流程都以线上解决方案替代。
She advises business owners to learn more about telecommuting software and to replace processes that can be moved online with online solutions.
此外，孙梦子讲述了疫情期间易观的应对策略，供企业管理者参考。
In addition, Sun Mengzi described the epidemic during the visual response strategy for enterprise managers.
一方面，高管在策略层面，将任务分解到各部门，再按业务目标把流程固化，形成文档，全公司发放。
On the one hand, at the strategic level, the executive breaks down tasks into departments and solidifies and documents processes in accordance with business objectives, which are distributed throughout the company.
另一方面，针对疫情启动“AB角色”制度，内部员工全部分为A或B角色，也就是说，同样一个岗位，对应备份两位员工，A、B每天同步工作内容和进展，且轮流上班，A上3天班、B上3天班，减少感染的风险。
On the other hand, to start the "AB role" system, internal staff are divided into A or B roles, that is, the same position, corresponding to the backup of two employees, A, B and synchronized work content and progress, and rotating work, A on three days, B on three days, reduce the risk of infection.
正常情况下，A、B协同工作，一旦一方出现问题，迅速启用另一个角色。
Normally, A and B work together, and when one party has a problem, another role is enabled quickly.
在家办公，时间弹性、节省了通勤时间，但也不是没有弊端，比如沟通效率低、员工归属感低、对人的意志力也是非常大的考验。
Working from home is time-sensitive and saves commuting time, but it's not without its drawbacks, such as poor communication, a low sense of belonging, and a great test of willpower.
当时Yahoo快不行了，最后一任CEO Marissa Mayer（玛丽莎·梅耶尔）上任的第一件事，就是把Yahoo的所有员工叫回公司上班，不要再在家办公了。
When Yahoo was running out of steam, the last CEO, Marissa Mayer (Marissa Mayer), called all Yahoo employees back to work and stopped working from home.
而想要快速进入工作状态，应该注意以下几点：第一，形成规律作息。
But wants to enter the working state quickly, should notice the following points: First, forms the regular work.
在家办公，对公司而言，考验的是把目标拆解为任务的能力，对员工而言，非常考验区分工作和休息的能力。
Working from home tests a company's ability to break down goals into tasks and, for employees, the ability to distinguish between work and rest.
比如可以制定每天的日程计划表，固定的时间处理工作，清晰地区分好工作和休息时间，才能既高效，又劳逸平衡。
For example, you can establish a daily schedule, fixed time management work, and a clear distinction between work and rest time, can be both efficient and elegant.
第二，不在休息区办公。
Second, do not work in the rest area.
Edward称，很重要一点，就是你真的得在家里为自己准备一间屋子，专门用来办公，然后你办公的时候别人不能进来打扰你，将工作环境和生活环境分开。
The important thing, Edward says, is that you really have to have a room at home for you to work in, and then no one else can come in to disturb you while you're at work, separating the work environment from the living environment.
第三，要方法搭配工具，如对自己实行目标管理，同时搭配使用协同办公软件。
Third, use a combination of tools, such as goal management for yourself, and collaborative office software.
