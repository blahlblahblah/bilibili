他们应该被看见河南邓州一名贫困人家的女儿因没有手机上网课服药自杀，引发舆论热议。
They should have seen the daughter of a poor family in Dunzhou, Henan province, commit suicide by taking drugs without a cell phone, sparking a public outcry.
幸运的是，轻生女孩已无生命危险。
Fortunately, the girl's life is not in danger.
在这场波及全国的疫情中，从小学到高校的几千万学生，都被要求集中上网课。
Tens of millions of students, from primary schools to colleges and universities, have been asked to focus on online classes in the nationwide epidemic.
如果不是这一极端案例，很多人大概不会意识到，目前还存在着一个为上网、为移动终端而犯愁的群体。
Had it not been for this extreme case, many would not have realized that there is still a group of people who are worried about access to the Internet and mobile terminals.
截至2018年第四季度，我国固定宽带家庭普及率达到86.1%；移动宽带用户普及率更是达到93.6%。
By the fourth quarter of 2018, the country had 86.1 per cent fixed broadband household penetration and 93.6 per cent mobile broadband penetration.
这两年，关于5G的讨论不绝于耳，不少人甚至自嘲离不开WIFI。
Over the past two years, there has been much discussion of the 5G, and many people have laughed at themselves for being WIFI-bound.
“无手机上网课”背后的深层次问题值得深思。
The deep-seated problem behind the "mobile phone-free Internet class" is worth thinking about.
低保家庭的“二女儿”2月29日，河南省邓州市一位初中三年级在读的女孩李铭（化名）吞下了大把药物，那本是患精神疾病的母亲的处方药。
Second Daughter of a Low-income Family Li Ming (not her real name), a junior high school student in Dengzhou, Henan province, swallowed a handful of medicines prescribed for his mentally ill mother on Feb. 29, 2007.
父亲李某党发现后，立刻拨打120将其送往医院救治。
After father Li Mou party discovers, call 120 to send him to hospital immediately for treatment.
救护车的鸣笛打破了村镇的平静。
The ambulance siren broke the peace of the village.
疫情期间，村民们大多赋闲在家，前来围观者拍下的视频，让这个贫苦家庭迅速成为舆论焦点。
During the outbreak, villagers mostly stayed at home and came to view the video, so that the poor family quickly became the focus of public opinion.
最初网传的版本中，吞下精神药物的女孩被认为是因家中贫困，没有钱买手机按时跟听学校网课而自杀。
In the original online version, girls who swallowed psychotropic substances were thought to be suicidal because their families were poor and did not have the money to buy mobile phones and attend school online classes on time.
而在次日邓州市政府新闻办的通报中，服药的原因被归于“赌气”。
The next day in the Dunzhou city government news office of the notification, the reason for taking the medicine was attributed to "gambling gas."
随着媒体的跟进，更具体的情况被披露。
More details are being revealed as the media follow.
综合报道看来，李铭为家中三个孩子的老二，姐姐和弟弟分别就读高一和小学六年级。
According to the comprehensive report, Li Ming is the second of three children in his family, sister and younger brother are enrolled in the first and sixth grades respectively.
她的父亲李某党左腿有残疾，靠补鞋挣钱，母亲则有精神疾病，没有劳动能力。
Her father, Li Mou, has a disability in his left leg and earns money by mending shoes, while his mother is mentally ill and unable to work.
他们家早在2013年就已经被识别为低保贫困户，目前未脱贫。
As early as 2013, their families have been identified as the poor low-income households, is not currently out of poverty.
李某党家中并非没有宽带，问题在于缺设备。
Li's home is not without broadband, the problem is lack of equipment.
他去年刚刚购买的手机，是全家唯一一部可以联网的智能手机。
The phone he bought last year is the only smartphone in the family that can be connected to the internet.
此前，家里并不会因为争夺手机引起太严重的家庭矛盾，但突如其来的疫情，突如其来的网课需求，让姐弟三人多次因为手机的分配权起争执。
The family did not have to fight over cellphones to cause serious family conflicts, but a sudden outbreak of the disease and a sudden demand for online classes caused the brothers and sisters to fight over the distribution of their mobile phones several times.
2月29日上午，姐姐正准备将手机给妹妹让其考试时，发现她已经吞了药。
On the morning of Feb. 29, my sister was about to give her a cell phone for her exam when she found that she had swallowed the medicine.
实际上，李铭冲动的个性早有端倪。
In fact, Li Ming impulsive personality has long been on the horizon.
根据李铭的姐姐回忆，两年前，李铭就曾因家庭琐事，有过一次服药昏迷的经历。
Two years ago, Li Ming had a drugged coma over family issues, according to his sister.
在这次吞下母亲的药物之前，姐姐便看到过李铭将一些不知来源的药品研磨成粉。
Before swallowing his mother's medicine, my sister had seen Li Ming grind some unknown sources of medicine into powder.
担心妹妹再次做傻事，姐姐将这些药粉丢弃了，却没料到她会去吃母亲的药。
Worried sister to do stupid things again, sister discarded the powder, but did not expect her to eat her mother's medicine.
邓州市扶贫办相关工作人员告诉中国新闻周刊，事发后，当地政府连夜为李铭家添置了新家电和被褥，并送去5000元现金。
Deng told China News Weekly that local authorities bought new household appliances and bedding for Li overnight and sent 5,000 yuan in cash after the incident.
河南教育部门也在次日下发通知，要求全省各地全面摸排学生网上学习情况，建立精准帮扶机制。
Henan Education Department also issued a notice the next day, the entire province to map out the students online learning situation, establish accurate help mechanism.
此外，通过李铭学校和亲戚的帮助，三姐弟收到了两台可以用于上网课的智能手机，手机不够用的矛盾暂时解决。
In addition, with the help of Li Ming School and relatives, the brothers and sisters received two smartphones that could be used for online classes.
但是，伴随这个极端案例的讨论，越来越多关于贫困地区、贫困家庭与网课的矛盾进入公众视野。
However, with the discussion of this extreme case, more and more conflicts between poverty-stricken areas, poor families and online classes are coming into the public eye.
“高三学霸家中没有WIFI，就跟邻居借网，每天8点爬上屋顶蹭网上课”“江西宁都偏远山区的胡成，在后山空旷的地方找到了手机信号，妈妈跑回家从家里给孩子搬来简易桌凳和棉衣、雨伞，守在孩子身边陪着胡成学习”“四川广元市旺苍县金银村的杨秀花，在离家4公里远的一个悬崖边发现信号特别稳定，由于学校要求学生每天早上7点45分打卡报到，她不得不6点就匆匆起床，书包里装上一天的口粮，她要在悬崖边学习到下午5点才回家”……那些孩子尽管没有做出极端行为，甚至被认为“励志”，但是他们奋力寻找手机信号的姿态让许多网友表示心酸。
Hu Cheng, in the remote mountainous area of Ningdu, Jiangxi Province, found a mobile phone signal in the deserted mountainous area of Houshan. Her mother ran home to fetch some simple benches and cotton clothes and umbrellas to her children.
典型的“数字鸿沟”在这起极端个例发生后，很多人追问，到底还有多少李铭？中山大学政治与公共事务管理学院副教授陈永杰认为，不会在少数。
The typical "digital divide" In the aftermath of this extreme case, many people are asking how much more Li Ming there is, according to Chen Yongjie, associate professor at the School of Political and Public Affairs Management at Zhongshan University.
一个月前，当教育部号召全国师生在网络直播中维系教学之初，陈永杰就意识到了可能出现的问题。
A month ago, when the Ministry of Education called on teachers and students across the country to keep teaching online, Chen was aware of possible problems.
2月15日，他在媒体上发表评论称，“停课不停学”须考虑学生家庭条件。
On Feb. 15, he wrote in the press that "non-stop learning" has to take into account students' family conditions.
陈永杰呼吁，学校、相关监管部门要及时了解每位学生的家庭条件，对家中无网络条件或电脑手机设备的学生给予帮助。
Chen called on schools and relevant regulatory authorities to keep abreast of each student's family conditions and to help students who do not have Internet access or computer equipment at home.
但这样的声音，迅速被淹没。
But the sound was quickly drowned out.
一开始，对网课不大熟悉的老师们贡献了各式表情包和“翻车现场”，接着还有“云体育课”“小学生调错台上了化学课”，相较之，“无条件上网课”形成强烈反差。
At first, teachers unfamiliar with the lessons donated a variety of expression packs and "flip-over scenes," followed by Cloud PE "Cloud PE" and "chemistry on the wrong stage," in sharp contrast to "unconditional Internet classes.
陈永杰告诉中国新闻周刊，李铭事件的发生，可以看做是一个典型的“数字鸿沟”问题。
Chen told China News Weekly that the incident could be seen as a classic "digital divide" problem.
在学术表达中，从经济、技术角度来看，数字鸿沟可以简单概括为：“有一些人拥有社会提供的最好的信息技术，他们有最强大的计算机、最好的电话服务、最快的网络服务，也受到了这方面的最好的教育；另外有一部分人，他们出于各种原因无法得到这一切。
In terms of academic expression, the digital divide can be summed up in economic and technical terms as follows: "Some people have the best information technology that society offers, they have the most powerful computers, the best telephone services, the fastest internet services and the best education in the field, and there are those who, for various reasons, cannot get it all."
这两部分人之间的差别，就是所谓的‘数字鸿沟’。
The difference between the two parts is what is called the 'digital divide'.
”现实中，处于这一鸿沟的不幸一边，就意味着该群体很少有机遇参与在线教育、培训等。
In reality, being on the wrong side of the divide means that the group has little opportunity to participate in online education, training, etc.
“低收入群体设备条件是推行网络课堂前必须考虑的因素。
"Facilities for low-income groups are a factor that must be taken into account before implementing online classes.
”陈永杰表示，此次疫情突发，除了经济因素，许多家庭因为返乡过年被困、孩子学习设备不在身边等各种原因，跟进网课存在障碍的绝不在少数。
Chen said the outbreak, in addition to economic factors, many families are stranded on their way home for the Chinese New Year and their children are not around to learn the equipment.
根据南方都市报报道，2月27日，佛山市禅城区区教育局对全区中小学生进行了无终端无网络情况摸底，共有54所学校的721名学生无终端和763名学生无网络，共计1484人，约占全区学生百分之一。
According to the Southern Metropolis Daily, on February 27, the Zen District Bureau of Education in Foshan City conducted a no-end mapping of primary and middle school students in the area.
作为相对富裕地区的城区，佛山当地教育局向21所存在无终端无网络学生的学校派发了平板电脑和网络流量，由学校派发给所有困难学生，并且对身处湖北等外地的学生将通过邮寄方式精准派发，确保一个学生也不落下。
As an urban area in relatively affluent areas, Foshan's local education bureau distributed tablets and network traffic to 21 schools with no-end Internet-free students, which were distributed by schools to all students in need, and to students from other places, including Hubei, by mail to ensure that not a single student was left behind.
还有一些省市采取了其他替代方法。
Other provinces and municipalities have adopted alternative methods.
比如，重庆、河南等部分省市的电视台开通了专用教学电视频道。
For example, TV stations in Chongqing and Henan have opened special teaching TV channels.
针对没有手机、有线电视的情况，李某所在的邓州市在此次事件发生后，将在确保疫情防控安全的前提下，统一组织学生到村部网上听课。
In the absence of mobile phones, cable television, Li's city of Dunzhou after the incident, will ensure the prevention and control of the disease on the premise of security, unified organization of students to the village department to attend classes.
陈永杰认为，“从河南女孩因上不起网课自杀事件上，决策者最应该反思的不是应对措施、不是扶贫，而应该是：教育决策在考虑大多数人获益或便利的同时，也不能忘记少数人可能存在的困难。
Chen Yongjie believes that "from Henan girls can not afford to suicidal online lessons, policy makers should reflect not on the response, not on poverty reduction, but on the fact that educational decision-making, while taking into account the benefits or convenience of the majority, should not forget the difficulties that may exist for a few.
”网课该怎么上？网课开课以来，不管对于教育部门、学校还是家长，监管都成了问题。
Regulation has been a problem for the department of education, schools and parents since the start of classes.
在广西桂林任职的某扶贫干部近来收到了群众反馈的问题——随着各行各业陆续复工，还没有开学的孩子成了问题。
A pro-poor cadre working in Guangxi's Guilin has recently received feedback from the masses - children who have not yet started school become a problem as industries resume work.
第一层问题是，孩子要上网课。
The first problem is that children have to take classes online.
父母把手机给了孩子，自己外出务工同样需要手机。
Parents give their children their mobile phones, which are also needed when they go out to work.
解决这个问题，可能会加重经济负担。
Solving this problem could increase the financial burden.
第二层问题是，孩子不上学，监管就成了问题。
The second problem is that supervision becomes a problem when children do not attend school.
家长复工后让孩子自己在家上网课就是一大忧虑。
It's a big worry when parents get back to work and let their kids get online at home.
还有，尽管教育部明确表示不得强制学生打卡，不得强制教师全部录网课，许多地区也明里暗里地违背。
Also, although the Ministry of Education has made it clear that students must not be forced to punch, teachers must not be required to take all online courses, many areas also explicitly and implicitly violate this.
中国新闻周刊采访了多位不同地区正通过网课学习的中学生，基本每个学校至少有一门课的任课教师会要求学生每天直播打卡，甚至学生也需要开视频。
NEWSWEEK interviewed a number of high school students in different regions who were studying online. Teachers in at least one course in almost every school would ask students to play cards live every day, and even students needed to play videos.
在邓州这件事发生后，许多人联想到去年那篇名为《这块屏幕可能改变命运》的报道。
After the incident in Dunzhou, many people thought of last year's story, "The Screen Can Change Fate."
这篇被广泛传播的报道记录了248所贫困地区的中学，通过直播，与著名的成都七中同步上课这个大型教育实验所遇到的争议和阻碍，以及最终的反馈——有的学校出了省状元，有的本科升学率涨了几倍、十几倍。
The widely publicized report chronicles the controversies and obstacles, as well as the feedback, of 248 secondary schools in poor areas that were broadcast live to synchronize with the famed Chengdu VII Middle School, a large-scale educational laboratory. Some schools have gone provincial, while others have seen their undergraduate enrollment increase several times and tenfold.
归根结底，讨论的是教育公平和形式创新的可能性。
In the final analysis, the possibility of educational equity and formal innovation is discussed.
但是，当特殊的时期，将成千上万中小学生推到大小屏幕前，效果因地区、因学校、因人而异。
But when it comes to special times, pushing thousands of schoolchildren onto screens, the effects vary by region, school, and person.
不过，陈永杰认为，两件事的比较略嫌不妥。
However, Chen Yongjie believes that the comparison between the two things is somewhat inappropriate.
“目的不一样，那个是公平，这次的网课是为了保持学生在家学习的状态，可能也有教学进度的考量。
"The goal is different, that's fair. This time the course is about keeping students at home and maybe teaching progress.
”如果网课是近阶段的大势所趋，如何去优化、调整？21世纪教育研究院副院长熊丙奇告诉中国新闻周刊，目前的中小学推行的在线教育，主要以学科知识为主，“实际上，停课不停学期间，可以让学生上一些启发教育、生活教育、生命教育之类的课程，不一定要以考试课程为主。
Xiong Bingqi, vice-dean of the Institute of Education for the 21st Century, told China News Weekly that online education in primary and secondary schools is now based on subject knowledge. "In fact, students can take enlightening, life-saving and life-education classes without necessarily focusing on exam-based courses.
”陈永杰表示，对于面临初考、中考压力的学生，自然还是要以考试为重，但是受疫情影响，中考、高考时间是否会推迟仍是变数，他建议，教育部应尽快明确时间，好让学校、学生及时对复习方案做出相应的调整。
Chen Yongjie said that students facing pressure in the first and second examinations were naturally focused on exams, but whether the school entrance examination and college entrance examination time would be delayed due to the epidemic situation remained a variable.
