明明开学都推迟了家长反而更忙乱了疫情之下，不少当爹妈的宅在家，陪娃过着漫长的寒假。
Clearly delayed the start of school parents are more busy under the epidemic, many parents when the house, accompanied by a long winter holiday.
停课不停学，老师当主播，在家上网课，却让不少家长直呼撑不住。
Classes do not stop learning, teachers when the anchor, at home online classes, but many parents can not sustain.
一边要在家办公，一边还要参与学校布置的任务，光是每天直播课的花式打卡，就逼疯了一批家长。
While working from home, but also to participate in the task assigned by the school, just daily live classes fancy card printing, forced a number of parents crazy.
家长们这下子就搞不懂了，明明开学都推迟了，自己反而更忙乱了。
Parents now do not understand, clearly delayed the start of school, their own on the contrary more busy.
直播2月10日，全国各地中小学开始陆续在线上课。
On Feb. 10, primary and secondary schools across the country began to teach online.
仅在当天，就有全国300多个城市的60万人民教师变身主播，通过某软件给学生上直播课。
On that day alone, more than 600,000 teachers in more than 300 cities around the country turned into hosts, using a software program to broadcast live lessons to students.
“偶买噶，这个题真的好好做好上头哦！所有的学生，快，给我学他！”看直播课的滋味，可跟看直播购物大不一样，家长们很快就尝够了。
"I buy Ga, this problem is really good top Oh! All students, quickly, give me to learn from him!" The taste of live classes can be very different from watching live shopping, parents soon had enough.
虽然是居家上课，不过早读、升国旗、眼保健操一个都不落。
Although it is home-based classes, but morning reading, flag-raising, eye-care exercises do not fall.
家长得全天不间断地给孩子拍照、打卡、接龙，不然班主任艾特你私聊。
Parents have to take pictures, punch cards, and pick up dragons all day long, otherwise the head teacher, Ait, will talk to you privately.
看升国旗写观后感，家长也得参与，老师明确说了，观后感中一定要有家长的感想。
Look at the national flag after writing, parents have to participate, teachers clearly said that a sense of the future must have parents' feelings.
家长群通知截图当然，平时少不了的各种书面、口头作业，在线上一样照办。
Parents group notification screenshots, of course, usually all kinds of written, oral, online do the same.
延期开学通知发布后，学校安排了一系列家庭教育指导计划，以竞赛的形式从劳动、手工、运动、读书等方面布置任务，要求家长配合完成。
Following the announcement of the extension of the school year, the school arranged a series of family education guidance programmes in the form of competitions to assign tasks in the form of labour, crafts, sports, reading, etc., requiring the cooperation of parents.
家长们平时就对“微信作业”颇有微词，但一听说小朋友之间要进行评比，又立马一个鲤鱼打挺撸起袖子就加油干。
Parents usually complain about "micro-letter homework," but when they hear about children being evaluated, they immediately get a carp to stand up, roll up their sleeves and do it.
家长们这时猛然发觉，开学上课家庭是课堂的延伸，开了直播课后，客厅就变成了教室，自己在陪着娃一起上学。
Parents suddenly realized that the beginning of classes is the extension of the classroom, held live after class, the living room became a classroom, accompanied by their children to school.
要是全职家长，兴许还忙得过来，但大多父母们都是要居家办公的。
A full-time parent might be busy, but most parents work from home.
陪娃一起上课受不了，娃陪你一起上班更吃不消。
Eva together with the class can not bear, baby accompany you to work more difficult.
当你要聚精会神地回复老板的消息，娃蹦跳着吵闹，一会儿钻你怀，一会儿盘你头，你两边却都不敢生气。
When you want to answer the boss's message, baby bouncing noise, drilling you, now dish your head, you both do not dare to angry.
有家长感叹，孩子才是居家办公最大的障碍。
Some parents lament that children are the biggest obstacle to working from home.
在家办公的最大挑战，不是协同工具不好用，也不是远程沟通不高效，而是家里孩子不上学。
The biggest challenge of working from home is not that collaborative tools are not easy to use, nor that remote communication is inefficient, but that children at home do not attend school.
歧途假期漫长，未尝不是家庭教育的好时机。
A long misguided holiday is not a bad time for family education.
在假期中重视学生的生活、生命、生存等教育，是当前更适合对学生进行的教育。
At present, it is more suitable for students to be educated by paying attention to their life, life and survival education.
教育部也提到，“停课不停学”不是指单纯意义上的网上上课，也不只是学校课程的学习，而是一种广义的学习，只要有助于学生成长进步的内容和方式都是可以的。
The Ministry of Education also noted that "non-stop learning" does not mean simply taking classes online, nor is it just learning in school, but learning in a broad sense, as long as it contributes to the growth and progress of students.
居家学习自有其优势所在，家长们可以结合疫情防控，多给娃们讲一些防疫阻击战中涌现的先进事迹，弘扬社会中的美德。
Home learning has its own advantages, parents can combine disease prevention and control, to tell children more advanced stories in the battle against epidemic prevention, promote the virtues in society.
也可以让娃们多读一些经典名著名篇，陶冶一下情操。
Can also let the children read some classic classics, edify the sentiment.
然而家长们发现，居家学习想要完全代替学校课堂教学，而罔顾居家学习因客观条件、学生自主学习能力等方面的原因，与课堂教学会有学习效果上的差别。
Parents, however, have found that homeschooling is a complete substitute for classroom instruction, regardless of the differences between home schooling and classroom teaching because of objective conditions and students' ability to learn independently.
更何况，对于上网课各个学龄段各有差别。
What's more, there are different ages for online classes.
小学生不必急着赶学新内容，效果很难保证，而且长时间盯着电子屏幕严重影响视力。
Elementary school children do not have to rush to learn new content, the effect is difficult to guarantee, and staring at the electronic screen for long periods seriously affects eyesight.
教育部也指出，对小学低年级上网学习不作统一硬性要求，由家长和学生自愿选择。
The Ministry of Education has also pointed out that online learning in the lower grades of primary school is not a uniform and mandatory requirement and is voluntarily chosen by parents and students.
同时，不得强行要求学生每天上网“打卡”、上传学习视频等，防止增加不必要的负担。
At the same time, students must not be forced to "punch a card" every day online, upload learning video, and so on, to prevent unnecessary burden.
前阵子最让家长们哭笑不得的是，按以往时间算其实还没开学呢，娃们反而都上起课来了。
A few days ago, parents most of the time to laugh at the fact that the time has not yet started school, the children instead began to classes.
自从直播课纷纷入局，在各地原计划的正式开学日之前，学生们反倒提前开始了新学期课程网上课程的学习。
Since the start of live classes, students have started online classes ahead of schedule, just before the official opening day.
有教育专家指出，现阶段的“停课不停学”，是偷换概念违规补课，搞得兴师动众，把所有教师、学生（包括幼儿园孩子）、家长都调动起来，折腾之余遭到大量吐槽。
Education experts point out that the current stage of "non-stop learning," is a concept of non-compliance with the concept of remedial classes, so that all teachers, students (including kindergarten children), parents are mobilized, suffering a lot of grooves.
漫长煎熬着，煎熬着，娃开学的日子越来越遥远了。
Long suffering, torment, the beginning of the school day more and more remote.
教育部1月27日发布通知，要求2020年春季学期延迟开学。
The Ministry of Education issued a circular on 27 January requesting the postponement of the start of the spring term 2020.
此后，全国各省份纷纷推迟原定的开学时间。
Since then, the country's provinces have postponed the scheduled start of classes.
江苏、上海等地的父母们，看到开学推迟时间定在2月17日。
Parents in Jiangsu, Shanghai and other places saw the start of school delayed until February 17.
没过几天，开学时间再次推迟，将开学时间延迟到了2月底。
A few days later, the start of the school year was postponed again, until the end of February.
2月5日以来，上海、浙江、江苏、重庆、广东、安徽宣布各级各类学校2月底前不开学，内蒙古、甘肃、黑龙江、西藏和青海预计3月初开学，湖北、吉林、天津、北京、宁夏、山西、新疆等省份则没有明确具体的开学时间点。
Since February 5, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Chongqing, Guangdong and Anhui have announced that schools of all types and at all levels will not open before the end of February. Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Heilongjiang, Tibet and Qinghai are expected to open in early March.
要知道娃们也煎熬，他们清楚放假在家不能超过一个星期。
You know the children are suffering, they know the holiday can not be more than a week.
一星期以内，衣来伸手饭来张口，不满意还可以说你两嘴，简直过的是神仙的日子。
Within a week, stretch out your hand to open mouth, not satisfied with you can also say that you two mouth, is almost immortal days.
只要过了一个星期，老妈早上看见还没起床，二话不说直接掀被子。
Only a week later, Mom saw that she had not got up in the morning and said nothing but lift the quilt directly.
吃完了饭，一个眼神就让去刷碗。
After eating a meal, let a glance to wash the dishes.
确认过眼神，你确实是他亲妈。
Yes, yes, you are his own mother.
如今推迟开学了，有些父母还在居家办公，同在一个屋檐下，一家人都懒得多看对方两眼，到底是亲生的，实在是太嫌弃了。
Now that school has been postponed, some parents are still working from home, under the same roof, the family is too lazy to look into each other's eyes, is really too tired.
这还不算什么，有家长惊闻体育老师开始直播布置家庭作业了，比如跳绳。
It wasn't much. Some parents were startled to hear that the PE teacher had started giving homework live, such as skipping rope.
由于大家都不能出门，家长们只好带着娃在阳台上跳，跳得四邻八舍都开始互相嫌弃了。
As no one was allowed to go out, parents had to take their babies on the balcony, jumped to the four neighbors are beginning to dislike each other.
庆幸的是，不少家长离上班不远了，眼看着复工的日子近了，近了，真的近了。
Fortunately, many parents are not far from work, see the day back to work is near, close, really close.
再这么熬下去，真要进精神科了。
If it goes on like this, it's going to the psych ward.
带娃让父母们绝望，上班从未如此渴望。
Taking babies makes parents desperate. They've never been so eager to go to work.
