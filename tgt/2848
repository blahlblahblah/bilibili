Peng Pai reporter Dan Yan Chao intern Song Wenhui Zhang Yia remember a month ago just arrived in Wuhan, the team members in the hotel training for two days, practice wearing protective clothing.
虽然各家医院都带来了一些防护物资，但大家都舍不得把防护服浪费在练习上，一套防护服一副手套，二十多名医生轮着穿了脱、脱了穿……最后，那套防护服破了，连手套也烂的不像样子。
Although the hospitals had brought with them some protective gear, everyone was loath to waste it on the exercise, a suit of protective gloves, and more than two dozen doctors wearing them in their turn... Finally, the suit broke and the gloves looked terrible.

回忆自己穿上防护服将要走进隔离区病房的那一刻，从紧张到能听清自己的心跳，慌到手抖，到逐渐坚定勇敢；从常听闻重症患者“这个班还在下个班就没了”，到近段自己所在病区都无患者死亡；从病区最初满床，到现在空床率近一半——情况在明显好转。
From the moment I put on my protective clothing and was about to enter the ward in the quarantine area, I was nervous enough to hear my heartbeat tremble, my hands tremble, my courage grew stronger.

就在报名前，张亚如曾梦到自己到武汉支援了。
