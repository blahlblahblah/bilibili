新京报记者了解到，除了口罩之外，消毒液、护目镜、体温计等防护产品也出现了大量空缺。
Beijing News reporter learned that in addition to masks, disinfectant, goggles, thermometers and other protective products have also appeared a large number of vacancies.
成都中光洗消剂有限公司总经理马灵告诉新京报记者，疫情发生之后，公司就开始加班加点生产消毒液。
Chengdu Zhongguang disinfectant Co. Ltd. General Manager Ma Ling told Xinjing News that after the outbreak, the company began to work overtime to produce disinfectant.
全文2455字，阅读约需5分钟1月28日，据国家卫健委介绍，从1月24日第一批从上海和广东派出医疗队赶赴武汉，到目前已经有30支医疗队共4130人到达了湖北开展工作。
The first medical teams from Shanghai and Guangdong were dispatched to Wuhan on January 24, and a total of 4,130 medical teams have arrived in Hubei province to work so far, the National Health Commission said.
因武汉受疫情影响，全国各地正在向武汉输送医疗资源，除了医疗队伍外，大批口罩、防护服、消毒液等相关医疗物资也正在路上。
Wuhan is affected by the epidemic, all over the country is sending medical resources to Wuhan, in addition to the medical team, a large number of masks, protective clothing, disinfectant and other related medical supplies are on the way.
新京报记者近期采访了多家春节期间仍在加班加点工作的医疗物资公司，部分公司一直在加班赶工生产口罩、药品、防护服等。
The Beijing News recently interviewed a number of medical supplies companies that still work overtime during the Spring Festival, and some companies have been working overtime to produce masks, medicines and protective clothing.
但也有医疗行业资深销售公司负责人陈华（化名）告诉新京报记者，目前，以口罩为例，价格涨幅已超5倍，市场价格水涨船高，商家掌握定价权。
But Chen Hua, head of the medical industry's senior sales company, told the Beijing News that prices for face masks, for example, have risen more than five-fold.
━━━━━线上断货线下断供，有人囤货涨价用现金交易“年二十八（1月22日），口罩出厂价还是每个0.3元，第二天就涨到每个0.6元，第三天就是每个1元，到现在每个要1.5元或2元。
2008-12-12 18: 23 2008-12-19 18: 23 2008-12-19 18: 23 2008-12-22 20: 19 The factory price for masks goes up from 0 yuan to 0.60 yuan per mask the next day, 1 yuan per mask on the third day, and 1.5 yuan or 2 yuan per mask today
”陈华是一家医疗行业销售公司的老板，他向新京报记者介绍平时一次性的医用口罩和医用外科口罩，成本一般在0.3元左右，随着疫情的发展和时间的推进，目前口罩的批发价已上涨至2元。
Chen Hua, the owner of a medical-care marketing company, introduced disposable medical masks and surgical masks to the Beijing News, at a cost of about 0.3 yuan.
陈华对新京报记者表示，目前部分厂家和批发商存在哄抬物价的行为，口罩等医疗物资成为卖方市场，有些批发商和生产厂商，囤有大批口罩，自行定价，远远高出平时价格。
At present, some manufacturers and wholesalers are engaged in price-raising activities, and medical supplies such as masks are becoming a seller's market. Some wholesalers and manufacturers are stocking up on masks and setting their own prices well above normal prices, Chen told the Beijing News.
“我确实有点看不下去了。
"I really don't like it any more.
”据陈华介绍，目前以口罩为例，大批交易使用现金，不使用转账，同时还要靠熟人介绍，才有资源。
Mr Chen said many of the current deals, for example, use cash, do not use money transfers and rely on acquaintances to get resources.
新京报记者了解到即便价格上涨，现在口罩依旧是供不应求，1月26日下午，新京报记者在淘宝上搜了十家卖3M口罩的店铺，均发现断货情况。
The Beijing News reported that even though prices were rising, the supply of face masks was still in short supply. On the afternoon of January 26, Xinjing News reporters searched 10 shops selling 3M masks on Taobao and found that they were no longer in stock.
同时，线下的一些药房，也出现断货或排长队买口罩的情况。
At the same time, some pharmacies under the line have also experienced stock outages or long queues for masks.
口罩价格上涨的速度让陈华震惊，但是他表示自己已经退出销售市场，只提供售货的信息资源，不参与买卖。
Mr. Chen was shocked by the speed with which the price of masks rose, but said he had withdrawn from the market, offering only information on sales and not buying and selling.
“我情愿花点钱免费送，我也不敢卖了。
"I'd rather give it away for free than sell it.
”陈华拥有自己的医疗物资生产厂商和销售公司，客户为经销商，终端是医院。
Chen Hua owns his own medical equipment manufacturer and distribution company, with clients as distributors and hospitals as its terminals.
陈华直言，口罩的成本在这个圈内是透明的，但是现在的出厂价，不管自己有没有加价，都会让人感觉到自己赚了很多。
Chen Hua bluntly said that the cost of the mask is transparent in this circle, but now the factory price, regardless of whether they raise prices, will make people feel that they make a lot of money.
陈华还表示，除口罩外，防护服等物资也出现涨价的情况，“以前卖60元一套防护服，现在平均涨到200元”。
Chen also said that in addition to masks, protective clothing and other supplies have increased in price, "previously sold 60 yuan a suit of protective clothing, now an average of 200 yuan."
截至目前，湖北省中医院、华科大协和医院、湖北省儿童医疗中心等8家医院相继发出公告，向社会各界征集捐赠N95口罩、一次性的医用口罩和医用外科口罩等防护物资。
So far, eight hospitals, including Hubei TCM, WACKU Concorde Hospital and Hubei Province Children's Medical Center, have issued notices, soliciting donations of N95 masks, disposable medical masks and medical surgical masks and other protective materials from the general public.
同时，武汉市周边的各县市也自制求援的图片，向外寻求帮助。
At the same time, Wuhan around the counties and cities also self-made pictures, seeking help.
━━━━━自发号召亲友加班，3天之内回岗员工数翻倍新京报记者了解到，除了口罩之外，消毒液、护目镜、体温计等防护产品也出现了大量空缺。
2008-10-19 09: 23 The Beijing News reporter learned that in addition to masks, a large number of protective products such as disinfectant, goggles, thermometers, etc. were also missing.
成都中光洗消剂有限公司总经理马灵告诉新京报记者，疫情发生之后，公司就开始加班加点生产消毒液。
Chengdu Zhongguang disinfectant Co. Ltd. General Manager Ma Ling told Xinjing News that after the outbreak, the company began to work overtime to produce disinfectant.
“20号我们就开始24小时轮班，全员两班倒。
We start a 24-hour shift on the 20th, with two full shifts
”为了供应疫情需求的消毒液，马灵表示公司给回来加班的员工开小食堂，提高工资，保障他们加班期间无“后顾之忧”。
To supply the disinfectant needed to fight the epidemic, Maling said the company was opening canteens for employees returning to work overtime to raise wages and protect them from concerns about working overtime.
马灵称，成都中光洗消剂有限公司原先只有60名员工，为了提高生产效率，春节期间员工自发号召亲友一起加班，3天之内员工人数增加到120名，“现在一天大概能生产3万瓶消毒液。
The number of employees at Chengdu's Zhongguang Laundry Co., Ltd. rose to 120 within three days during the Lunar New Year to raise production efficiency to around 30,000 bottles a day, according to Ma.
”。

据人民日报消息，1月27日，武汉大学中南医院托管的发热患者定点诊疗医院武汉市七医院出现了防护物品的短缺，储备已近“零库存”。
According to the People's Daily, on January 27, Wuhan Seven Hospital, a designated hospital for fever sufferers under the custody of Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital, ran short of protective goods and its reserves were close to "zero stock."
武汉市七医院发热门诊负责人介绍，自从1月22日开诊以来，开辟了6个诊室24小时接诊，安排9个医生同时为门诊患者服务，每天平均接诊患者在千人左右。
Since its opening on January 22, six consultation rooms have been opened for 24-hour visits, and nine doctors have been assigned to outpatient services at the same time, averaging about 1,000 patients per day, said the director of the fever clinic at Wuhan Seven Hospital.
武汉市七医院医疗物资库房的工作人员透露，临床医护人员每天正常消耗一千个防护口罩。
Staff at Wuhan Seven Hospital's medical supplies warehouse revealed that 1,000 respirators were routinely consumed by clinical staff every day.
不仅消毒液生产公司，有药品公司也在春节期间加班加点工作。
Not only did the disinfectant companies, but also the pharmaceutical companies worked overtime during the Spring Festival.
好医生药业集团有限公司总经理助理陈贤明告诉新京报记者，这次武汉通报新型冠状病毒疫情出现后，公司决定停止休假，恢复应急药品的生产。
Chen Xianming, assistant general manager of Good Doctors Pharmaceutical Group Co. Ltd. told the Beijing News that after Wuhan reported the emergence of a new coronavirus epidemic, the company decided to stop the holiday and resume production of emergency drugs.
“有员工接到复产通知后就高速路上直接折返，还有的员工刚把行李搬下车又搬上车出发。
"Some employees have been notified of the resumption of production directly back on the highway, and some employees have just moved their luggage off the bus and started.
”陈贤明称，公司在春节期间已连续发了三个假期通知，包括从1月15号通知春节放假时间；1月20号通知恢复生产；1月21号通知决定取消休假。
Chen Xianming said the company had issued three consecutive holiday notices during the Spring Festival, including a holiday notice on January 15, a notice to resume production on January 20 and a decision on January 21 to cancel the holiday.
━━━━━工信部：春节放假，生产能力发挥有限据工信部副部长王江平表示，从1月23日以来，工信部收到了武汉方面四批物资的需求清单，大致是四大类，二十多个品种，“大部分的物资供应，应该说能够满足需要，但是像防护服、口罩这一类的物资（的紧缺）现在十分突出”。
According to Wang Jiangping, vice minister of industry and communications, since January 23, the Ministry of Industry and Communications has received a list of needs for four batches of materials in Wuhan, roughly four categories and more than 20 varieties.
王江平解释称，中国是生产大国，但是因为春节放假，生产能力发挥不出来，中国春节都放假了，复工复产达到了40%，像防护服这样的产品仍然难以满足需求。
Wang explained that China is a big producing country, but due to the holiday of the Spring Festival and the lack of production capacity, the Chinese Spring Festival is closed and the resumption of work has reached 40%.
工信部方面表示，湖北省目前提供的需求清单大致是每天十万件医用的防护服，一个月300万件。
The ministry said the list of needs in Hubei province was roughly 100,000 medical suits a day and three million pieces a month.
符合中国标准的产能，实际上许可的只有40家企业，分布在14个省，总的生产能力每天实际上只有三万套的生产能力，那么现在复工40%只能达到一部分的产量，所以这个矛盾就非常突出，另外中国也有一部分出口的生产能力，大约是每天五万套的生产能力，这个是供欧美供海外的，没有中国标准的许可，这个转换需要一点时间。
With only 40 companies actually licensed in 14 provinces, with a total capacity of only 30,000 units per day, this contradiction is particularly acute now that 40 per cent of production capacity is only partially met. China also has some export capacity of about 50,000 units per day, which is for overseas use in Europe and the United States without Chinese standards.
据国家药品监督管理局官方微信，目前国家药监局已重点对医用防护口罩等生产企业进行监督检查，要求各地药品监管部门强化药品医疗器械生产流通环节的监督检查，重点对疫情防控相关生物制品、抗病毒类药品、医用防护口罩、医用防护服、呼吸机及相关体外诊断试剂等生产企业进行监督检查，加强监督抽检和不良反应(事件)监测。
According to an official letter from the State Administration of Pharmaceutical Supervision, the State Administration of Pharmacy has focused on supervision and inspection of medical respirators and other manufacturing enterprises, and local drug regulatory authorities are required to strengthen supervision and inspection of the production and circulation of medical equipment, with emphasis on the prevention and control of epidemic diseases and biological products, antiviral drugs, medical masks, medical protective clothing, respirators and related external diagnostic reagents.
对疫情防控相关药品医疗器械经营企业开展针对性监督检查，重点检查进货渠道、购销记录、储运条件等内容，督促企业严格遵守药品、医疗器械经营质量管理规范，确保经营药品医疗器械可追溯。
To carry out targeted supervision and inspection of enterprises engaged in the prevention and control of epidemic diseases, focusing on such contents as channels of purchase, purchase and sale records, storage and transportation conditions, and urge enterprises to strictly abide by the regulations on the quality control of drug and medical device business, so as to ensure the traceability of pharmaceutical medical devices.
