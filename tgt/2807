"In the early stages of the epidemic, people and resources were first focused on treating patients. Now that the epidemic has stabilized, people are beginning to think about staying in the crowd, which is a good sign.
”对于武汉以社区为单位进行的滞留人员安置，王振耀分析，“这样分散安置的救助效率是最高的。
Wang Zhenyao, an analysis of Wuhan's community-based resettlement of people, said: "This decentralized resettlement of the rescue efficiency is the highest.
在重大灾害面前，一般不选择大规模的聚集安置，安置单位规模越小，分得越细致，受灾人员的满意度越高。
In the face of major disasters, generally do not choose large-scale resettlement, the smaller the size of resettlement units, the more carefully divided, the higher the satisfaction of affected persons.
”王振耀曾参与统筹汶川救灾工作，他表示分散安置的优势在2008年汶川救灾中得到了验证。

我国2014年发布了《社会救助暂行办法》，其中明确了人民政府或者灾害救助应急综合协调机构应当“为受灾人员提供必要的食品、饮用水、衣被、取暖、临时住所、医疗防疫等应急救助”；对于生活无着人员应当提供“临时食宿、急病救治、协助返回等救助”。
