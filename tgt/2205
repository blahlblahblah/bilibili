作者 | 第一财经吴绵强2月20日晚上，在武汉江夏区方舱医院隔离的每一位患者都收到了一颗“星星”，上面有手写的祝福语：“叔叔阿姨晚上好，这是我自己做的许愿星，祝愿你们早日康复！”以上是央视新闻中的一个镜头。
Every patient quarantined at Wuhan Jiangxia District Fang Cao Hospital on the night of February 20 received a handwritten message saying: "Good evening, uncle and aunt, this is my wish star, wish you a speedy recovery!"
亲手为这些患者送上“星星”的，是在此值晚班的南京市中西医结合医院护士王慧敏。
Hand-delivered to these patients "stars", is the night duty of the Nanjing Chinese and Western medicine combined hospital nurses Wang Huimin.
这位可爱的小姑娘希望，自己亲手折叠的这些许愿星能够让患者在隔离的初春之夜也能“仰望星空”。
The lovely little girl hopes that these vows, folded by her own hands, will enable the patient to "look up to the stars" on an isolated early spring night.
若将时间回调一个月，可能很少会有人将收治于方舱医院的患者、驰援而来的医护人员以及静美的“星空”联系在一起。
A month's reshuffle would probably tie in with patients admitted to the cabin hospital, health-care professionals and the "starry night" of quiet beauty.
1月20日，是新冠肺炎防控的重要转折点，特别是随着1月23日武汉宣布封城，各地的防控措施空前提升，但面临的难关和压力也随之出现。
January 20 marked an important turning point in the prevention and control of pneumonia in the New Crown, particularly with the announcement of the city's closure on 23 January, which saw an unprecedented rise in control measures across the country.
封城之下，武汉必须跨过应收尽收、物资紧缺、医护感染等几道现实难关。
Under the siege, Wuhan must cross the receivable, material shortages, medical care infection and other practical difficulties.
全国各地的驰援力量也投入到了帮助武汉爬坡跨坎的大战之中。
All over the country, the rescue force has also been engaged in helping Wuhan climb the slope of the Great War.
纾解“堰塞湖”1月下旬之后，武汉市各区的发热人员持续上升，中心城区的各大医院人满为患。
Relief "Yan Sehu" in late January, Wuhan city districts continue to rise fever, central city hospitals are overcrowded.
1月23日，第一财经记者前往武汉市红十字医院采访发现，医院等待检测体温、拍片诊断的人员排起长队，医护人员身穿防护服给患者监测体温，导诊台的护士忙碌地为前来咨询的患者答疑解惑。
On January 23, the first financial reporter went to Wuhan Red Cross Hospital and found that there was a long line of people waiting for a temperature test and a diagnosis. Medical staff were dressed in protective clothing to monitor the temperature.
由于等不到床位，有的患者就睡在医院大厅的长条凳上。
Unable to wait for beds, some patients sleep on long benches in the hospital lobby.
武汉随之出台了相关政策，试图解决医院人满为患的问题。
Wuhan subsequently issued relevant policies to try to solve the problem of hospital overcrowding.
1月24日，武汉市疫情防控指挥部发布第7号公告称，为解决发热门诊等候时间长、床位安排不及时等问题，全面实行发热市民分级分类就医制度。
On January 24, the Wuhan Municipal Command of Disease Control and Prevention issued Notice No. 7, saying that in order to solve the problem of long waiting time and untimely bedspace arrangement in fever clinics, the system of classifying febrile citizens for medical treatment has been fully implemented.
彼时，武汉市要求全员排查发热病人，而这项排查重任就落在了基层社区头上，“由全市各社区负责，全面排查所服务辖区发热病人（含已就医和未就医市民），并送社区医疗中心对病情进行筛选、分类。
At the time, Wuhan required full-time screening of febrile patients, and the onus fell on grass-roots communities to "conduct a comprehensive survey of febrile patients (both hospitalized and untreated) in the areas served, and to refer them to community health centres for screening and classification."
”据7号公告，“对于不需要到发热门诊就诊的病人，由各社区落实在家居家观察，社区负责做好市民居家观察服务工作。
"For patients who do not need to go to a fever clinic, home-based home monitoring is implemented by the community, which is responsible for the home-based observation service," it said.
”由此一来，许多新冠肺炎确诊病例以及疑似病例患者必须回到各自所在的社区，他们只能待在家里居家隔离治疗，并等待社区逐级上报并安排床位等待救治。
As a result, many diagnosed and suspected cases of pneumonia must return to their communities, where they can only stay at home for home-based treatment and wait for the community to step in and arrange beds for treatment.
这使得人手紧缺的基层社区压力倍增，更为主要的是，居家隔离实际上也成为了扩大感染的一大隐患。
This adds to the pressure on understaffed grass-roots communities and, more importantly, the fact that isolation at home is also a major risk factor for the spread of infection.
据第一财经记者了解，受制于车辆运力以及基层社区医疗服务中心的救治能力，许多社区内持续增加的确诊、疑似患者一时间难以安排及时就医就诊，最终导致社区内患者形成就诊“堰塞湖”。
According to the first financial reporter, subject to the capacity of vehicles and grass-roots community health services, many communities continue to increase the number of diagnosis, suspected patients can not arrange timely medical treatment, ultimately leading to the formation of patients within the community "Yan Sehu."
1月25日，武汉市新冠肺炎疫情防控指挥部举行调度会，决定在武汉市江夏区黄家湖建设雷神山医院，将新增床位1600张左右。
On January 25, the Wuhan Xinguan Pneumonia Prevention and Control Command held a meeting and decided to build Lei Shenshan Hospital in the Jiangxia District of Wuhan City, about 1,600 beds will be added.
随后又投建雷神山医院。
Subsequently, Lui Shenshan Hospital was built.
虽然火神山、雷神山医院陆续开建，武汉本地原有医疗资源也极力挖潜，但依然远远满足不了求医需要。
Although Flamingo Hill, Lei Shenshan Hospital began to build, Wuhan local original medical resources are also vigorously explored, but still far from meeting the needs of medical treatment.
此时的武汉，医疗资源已经远超负荷极限，不少患者痛苦煎熬。
Wuhan at this time, medical resources have been far beyond the limits of the load, many patients suffering.
“我们很揪心、很痛苦的是，已经确诊的和很多疑似的病人没有住进指定医院救治，无法及时到达医院得到很好救治，形成了救治的‘堰塞湖’。
"We were very worried, very painful, has been diagnosed and many suspected patients did not live in designated hospitals, can not reach the hospital in time to get good treatment, formed a treatment of 'Yan Sehu'.
”2月5日晚间，在新闻发布会上，武汉市人大常委会主任、市委副书记胡立山回顾并承认了当地收治“堰塞湖”存在的事实。
On the evening of February 5, at a press conference, Hu Lishan, the municipal deputy secretary and chairman of the Standing Committee of the Standing Committee of the Standing Committee of the municipal government, reviewed and acknowledged the existence of "quake lakes.
在中央赴湖北指导组的推动下，紧急抽调的20个省市大型三级综合医院的医学救援队赶赴武汉，武汉市的会展中心、体育场馆等场馆也被改造成方舱医院，集中收治确诊轻症病人。
Under the impetus of the Central Steering Group to Hubei, medical rescue teams from 20 large-scale level-III polyclinics in 20 provinces and municipalities rushed to Wuhan, where the exhibition centre and stadiums were converted into a square-cabin hospital to treat patients with confirmed mild cases.
2月2日，火神山医院正式交付使用。
February 2, the fire god mountain hospital official delivery.
当晚，武汉市又紧急征用17家医疗机构作为第四批定点医院，专门收治从之前三批定点医院转出的首次检测结果为阴性的疑似病例。
That night, Wuhan City urgently requisitioned 17 medical institutions as the fourth batch of designated hospitals to treat suspected cases of negative first-time test results from the three previous designated hospitals.
然而，即使如此，依然难以满足临床救治的床位需求。
Even so, however, it is difficult to meet the demand for clinically treated beds.
2月8日，雷神山医院交付，又进一步缓解了“人等床”的局面。
February 8, the delivery of Raytheon Hill Hospital, further easing the situation of "people waiting for bed."
随着定点医院的不断新增，以及拉网式大排查的展开，许多确诊新冠肺炎患者以及疑似患者得到有效收治的覆盖面进一步扩大。
With the increasing number of designated hospitals and the roll-out of screening, the coverage of effective treatment for many newly diagnosed cases and suspected patients has been further expanded.
2月21日下午，据武汉市常务副市长胡亚波介绍，武汉目前已经有13家方舱医院开舱，可提供救治的床位达到了13348张，已使用9313张，前期存在的患者收治难问题已经得到有效解决。
On February 21, 2007, according to Hu Yapo, deputy mayor of Wuhan city, Wuhan has opened 13 cabin hospitals with 13,348 beds available for treatment, and 9,313 beds have been used.
他同时表示，将准备进一步加强方舱医院的扩容，计划再建19家，也就是到2月25日，全市储备的方舱医院床位达到3万张。
He also said he plans to further increase the capacity of the hospital, with plans to build another 19 -- 30,000 hospital beds in the city's stock by February 25.
“裸奔”的医护人员在举全国之力救治武汉乃至湖北的这场战役中，防护物资紧缺的问题在很长时间都受到极大关注。
"Naked" medical personnel in the national effort to save Wuhan and even Hubei this battle, the problem of shortage of protective materials has been a great concern for a long time.
1月下旬开始，网上即频频传出各种有关防护物资紧缺的求助信息，其中有不少来自医护人员和医疗机构。
Since late January, there have been numerous online calls for information about shortages of protective equipment, many from health-care workers and institutions.
协和医院、同济医院等均通过互联网对外发布求助信息称：急需防护服、医用N95口罩、医用外科口罩、一次性隔离衣和防护面罩等，“这些仅为参考，实际上是越多越好。
Concorde Hospital, Tongji Hospital and others have posted help messages via the Internet saying: "There is an urgent need for protective clothing, medical N95 masks, medical surgical masks, disposable protective clothing and face protection.
”一些求助信息显示，有的医院由于防护物资紧缺，医护人员不得不重复使用口罩、防护服等，甚至有一些医护人员不得不自己改制防护装备。
Some help messages say hospitals are running short on protective equipment, forcing staff to reuse masks and protective clothing, and some have had to make their own equipment.
第一财经调查发现，随着疫情的扩大，各大医院的N95口罩、医用防护服和护目镜等防护物资很快消耗殆尽，出现高度紧缺的局面。
The first financial investigation found that as the epidemic spread, major hospitals N95 masks, medical protective clothing and goggles and other protective equipment quickly ran out, resulting in a high degree of shortage.
最开始，防护物资都是优先给收治新冠肺炎患者的科室使用，而一些普通科室患者则无法得到充分配置。
Initially, protective materials were given priority for departments that treated patients with new crown pneumonia, while some general department patients could not be fully allocated.
1月30日下午，接受第一财经记者采访的协和医院某科室护士就确认，他们医院的防护物资已经非常紧缺。
On the afternoon of January 30, nurses from a hospital in Concorde, interviewed by the first financial reporter, confirmed that their hospital's protective materials were already in short supply.
同时，普通病房医护人员面临被感染新型肺炎的危险，而由于物资紧缺，这些普通科室医护人员在防护物资的配发上只能排到后面。
At the same time, medical staff in the general wards are at risk of contracting new pneumonia, and because of shortages, they can only be placed behind in the distribution of protective equipment.
事实上，前期一些医院也收到了社会爱心人士的捐赠，但是有些爱心人士对防护物资的医用质量标准并不清楚，造成一些捐助物资无法迅速发挥效用。
In fact, some hospitals have received donations from people of social concern in the early stages. However, some caring people are not clear about the medical quality standards of protective materials, resulting in some donations not being able to function quickly.
与此同时，社会上对于物资分配的质疑声四起：一方面临床急需的防护物资紧缺，另一方面主管物资捐赠的武汉红十字会却未能及时把仓库内堆积如山的物资及时送到临床救治一线。
At the same time, there are widespread doubts about the distribution of supplies: on the one hand, there is a shortage of urgently needed medical supplies, while on the other hand, Wuhan Red Cross, which is in charge of the donation of materials, has failed to deliver the mountain of materials to the clinic in time.
武汉红会方面的解释是，他们只管发放，无权进行具体的分配。
Wuhan Red Cross Society explained that they only issued, do not have the right to carry out specific allocation.
▲武汉红十字会仓库一角面对质疑，2月1日晚间，武汉新冠肺炎防控指挥部指派湖北九州通医药集团，负责红十字会仓库医疗防护物资的分发。
Wuhan Red Cross warehouse in the face of doubts, February 1, Wuhan Xinguan Pneumonia Command assigned Hubei Kyushu Tong Medical Group, responsible for the distribution of the Red Cross warehouse medical protection materials.
1月30日晚，湖北副省长曹广晶回应了医疗物资的分配问题，称将全力以赴组织省内的企业复工、复产，相关企业24小时不停产。
On the night of January 30, Hubei Vice Governor Cao Guangjing responded to the distribution of medical supplies, saying that every effort would be made to organize enterprises in the province to return to work and resume production, and relevant enterprises do not stop production for 24 hours.
截止到2月21号，中央各部委和各省市向湖北调拨防护服、隔离衣共计193万件，N95口罩295万只。
By February 21, the central government departments and provinces and municipalities had allocated 1.93 million protective clothing and 2.95 million N95 masks to Hubei province.
2月20日，中央各部委、各省调拨支援的高端ICU防护服达到6.4万件，非ICU医用防护服4.9万件，N95口罩达到10万只。
On February 20, the central ministries and provinces allocated 64,000 high-end ICU protective clothing, 49,000 non-ICU medical suits and 100,000 N95 masks.
在2月20日下午的国新办发布会上，中央指导组成员、国家发展改革委员会副主任连维良表示，目前湖北武汉医用物资短缺状况有了很大改善，尽管仍然是紧平衡，对一线医护人员和高危人员所需的防护物资是可以保障的。
At a press conference on the afternoon of February 20, Lianwei Liang, a member of the Central Steering Committee and deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission, said the shortage of medical supplies in Wuhan, Hubei province, has improved considerably, although it is still a tight balance and the necessary protective materials for front-line medical personnel and high-risk personnel can be guaranteed.
为强化医用物资保障，下一步还将做到增加数量、保障质量、应保尽保、特事特办。
In order to strengthen medical supplies, the next step will be to increase the quantity, quality, coverage and special services.
超1700医护人员感染但最令人痛心的事情还是发生了。
More than 1,700 paramedics were infected but the most distressing thing happened.
2月6日晚，北京协和医院多名医生对第一财经记者确认，武汉中心医院的眼科医生李文亮因感染新冠肺炎去世。
On the night of Feb. 6, doctors from Beijing Concorde Hospital confirmed to the first financial reporter that Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital, died of pneumonia.
事实上，李文亮并非第一位感染的医护人员。
In fact, Li Wenliang was not the first health care worker to be infected.
早在1月20日，钟南山院士在接受央视记者采访时，就披露了有14名医务人员感染新冠肺炎的信息。
As early as January 20, Academician Zhong Nan Shan in an interview with CCTV reporters, disclosed that 14 medical personnel infected with the new crown pneumonia.
