一边是政府选定的工厂紧急扩大产能，另一边，一批主营出口的医用防护服工厂却因没有“内销”资质，被要求停产。
On one side are factories selected by the government to expand capacity on an emergency basis, while on the other, a group of medical-protective clothing factories, which export mainly, have been ordered to shut down because they lack "domestic" qualifications.
记者| 肖文杰编辑 | 王姗姗医用防护服是目前武汉、湖北，乃至全国最紧缺的防疫医疗物资之一。
At present, Shanshan Wang is one of the most urgently needed medical supplies for epidemic prevention in Wuhan, Hubei and even China.
而这一产品在国内最大的生产基地之一，就在湖北省仙桃市。
And this product in the country's largest production base, just in Xiantao City, Hubei Province.
人民网2月8日报道称，当地政府立下“军令状”，用10天时间，至2月8日要将全市医用防护服的日产量，从过去的五六千件提升至3万件的水平，而这一任务对仙桃来说是“天大的考验”，原因是“绝大部分无纺布企业以做外贸为主，持国内防护服生产资质的很少”。
The local government issued a military writ to lift the daily production of medical protective clothing from 5,000 to 30,000 by February 8, a "big test" for the peaches because "the vast majority of non-woven enterprises mainly do foreign trade, holding few domestic protective clothing production qualifications."
然而仙桃这个“无纺布之乡”在医用防护服上的产能似乎并未得到充分利用。
But the capacity of peach, the "home of nonwoven fabrics," for medical protective clothing does not seem to be fully utilized.
2月开始，一批工厂被该市新冠肺炎疫情防控指挥部企业生产组发文要求不得开工。
Starting in February, a number of factories were ordered not to start work by the enterprise production team of the city's New Crown Pneumonia Command.
其中一家主要生产出口无纺布和医用防护服的公司向《第一财经》YiMagazine证实，2月3日，仙桃市的市场监管部门以“对全市无纺布企业生产秩序进行规范整顿”为理由，要求其立即停产，停产的公司被告知，湖北和武汉的需求将由政府统一调配。
On February 3, market regulator Yi Magazine, one of the major producers of non-woven fabrics and medical protective clothing, confirmed to First Finance that on February 3 the market regulator in Xiantao demanded that it stop production immediately on the grounds that it was "standardizing the production order of non-woven enterprises in the city.
当时，这家工厂正在联系工人，试图尽快复工。
At the time, the factory was contacting workers to try to get back to work as soon as possible.

2月4日，仙桃市新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情防控指挥部企业生产组发布了一份《关于进一步规范无纺布企业生产秩序工作的情况说明》（以下简称《说明》），圈定了60家“疫情防控物资重点生产企业”，包括10家省指定的医用防护服生产企业、28家符合国标的一次性医用口罩生产企业，以及22家为上述38家企业提供原材料、印刷、包装等配套生产的企业。
On February 4, the Enterprise Production Group of the Pneumonia Prevention and Control Command for the New Coronavirus Infection in Xiantao City issued an Information Note on Further Regulating the Production Order of Non-woven Enterprises, including 10 enterprises designated to manufacture medical protective clothing, 28 enterprises that meet the national standard for the production of disposable medical masks, and 22 enterprises that supply the above-mentioned 38 enterprises with raw materials, printing and packaging.
△向左滑动查看完整企业名单负责完成日产3万件防护服“军令状”的，也正是这份名单上的10家企业。
Slide to the left to view the complete list of enterprises responsible for the production of 30,000 "military writs" of protective clothing per day, which is exactly the list of 10 enterprises.
在此范围之外的其他无纺布生产企业，首先是一律被要求严格按照湖北省针对防范疫情规定停工停产。
Other non-woven production enterprises outside this range are required, first and foremost, to stop production in strict accordance with the regulations on the prevention of epidemic diseases in Hubei Province.
同时，有一批过去一直从事外贸订单生产的无纺布企业，因未申请内销所需的相关资质，都成为本次规范生产秩序、停产整顿的对象。
At the same time, a number of non-woven enterprises that have been engaged in the production of foreign trade orders in the past, because they have not applied for the relevant qualifications required for domestic sales, have become the object of this standardization of production order, cut-off and rectification.
为了使产能迅速提升到每天3万套，仙桃市的做法，是围绕上述定点企业给予大量资源支持，在很多环节实行统一管理，协助企业增加产能。
In order to rapidly upgrade production capacity to 30,000 units per day, the approach of Xiantao is to provide substantial resource support around the above-mentioned designated enterprises, implementing unified management in many links and assisting enterprises to increase their production capacity.
当地银行向相关企业发放贷款已超过3.7亿元。
Local banks have lent more than 370 million yuan in loans to related enterprises.
而另一边，大量出口产能却无法利用，其中不乏得到一线医生认可的防护服。
On the other hand, much of the export capacity, including protective clothing approved by front-line doctors, is not available.
根据《说明》，此次以“保重点、保品质、保供应”为目的的整顿，将针对四类企业：1）未取得医疗器械生产许可证、医疗器械产品注册证（以下简称“两证”）的无纺布企业；2）有“两证”但生产环境不达标的无纺布企业；3）不是定点生产及配套企业的；4）虽拥有出口资质，但不符合出口转内销相关规定要求的无纺布企业。
According to the Note, this reorganization, which aims at "ensuring focus, quality and supply," will target four categories of enterprises: (1) non-woven enterprises that have not obtained medical device production license, medical device product registration certificate (hereinafter referred to as "two certificates"); 3) non-textile enterprises with "two licenses" but substandard production environment;
在中国生产和销售医用防护服、医用口罩等产品，需要药监局颁发的医疗器械生产许可证。
The production and sale of medical protective clothing and medical masks in China requires a license issued by the Drug Administration for the production of medical instruments.
而只经营出口的公司没有这些证件。
Companies dealing only in exports do not have these documents.
无纺布是生产医用一次性口罩和医用防护服的主材。
Non-woven cloth is the main material for producing medical disposable masks and medical protective clothing.
根据仙桃市经信委2018年的数据，当地规模以上的无纺布生产企业超过100家，但90%以上的产品（不限于医用产品）都用于出口，拥有在国内生产和销售医用防护服资质的只有2家。
According to 2018 data of the Economic and Social Commission of Xiantao, there are more than 100 non-woven manufacturing enterprises above the local scale, but more than 90 per cent of the products (not limited to medical products) are exported, and only two are qualified to produce and sell medical protective clothing domestically.
申请标准以及国内医院销售渠道的特殊壁垒，是大量无纺布企业申请内销资质意愿不强的原因。
The application standard and the special barrier of the domestic hospital sales channel are the reasons why a large number of nonwoven enterprises apply for the domestic marketing qualification.
而不少出口医用防护服的生产厂家，其产品虽然不符合国内标准，但达到日本、美国或欧盟标准。
And many export medical protective clothing manufacturers, although their products do not meet domestic standards, but meet Japan, the United States or EU standards.
上述不具名公司告诉《第一财经》YiMagazine，1月25日该企业曾将库存的数千件供给欧洲订单的防护服，通过民间志愿者转交给武汉协和等医院，并由医生现场开箱确认防护服是否符合要求。
The anonymous company told First Finance Yi Magazine that on January 25 it had transferred thousands of protective clothing from its stock for European orders to hospitals such as Wuhan Concorde through civilian volunteers, and that doctors opened boxes on site to confirm that the suits met the requirements.
验收医生反馈则是，这些防护服的质量高于国标，可以在隔离病房、ICU、检验科等环境内使用。
The acceptance doctor feedback is that the quality of these protective clothing is higher than the national standard, can be used in isolation ward, ICU, laboratory and other environment.
这家公司在平日员工和原材料充足的情况下，每天可以生产5000套以上的医用防护服。
The company can produce more than 5,000 medical suits a day with plenty of staff and raw materials.
今年1月31日，国务院曾下发通知，要求紧急进口日、美、欧标准医用防护服。
On January 31 this year, the State Council issued a circular requesting emergency import day, the United States and Europe standard medical protective clothing.
根据工信部副部长王江平提供的数据，中国有每天5万套不合中国标准的医用防护服出口产能。
According to Wang Jiangping, vice minister of communications and industry, China has 50,000 medical suits a day that do not meet Chinese standards for export capacity.
而工信部将“推动出口标准和中国标准的衔接，使符合欧盟标准、美国标准的出口产品能够在中国的一些领域中可以使用”。
The ministry will "promote the convergence of export standards with Chinese standards so that exports meeting EU and US standards can be used in some areas in China."
即使没有整顿，这家公司要想靠自己的力量恢复平时的产能也很困难。
Even without a clean-up, it will be difficult for the company to regain its normal capacity on its own.
武汉新冠肺炎疫情告急以来，这家工厂持续收到大量企业和个人的购买需求，而且多为捐赠目的的采购。
Wuhan Xinguan Pneumonia outbreak since the crisis, the factory has continued to receive a large number of enterprises and individuals to buy demand, mostly for donation purposes.
但时逢春节假期，工人多已返乡，他们大都居住在湖北，即使他们愿意返工，也因交通管制难以及时回到工厂。
But every spring holiday, workers have returned home, most of them living in Hubei, even if they are willing to rework, traffic control is difficult to return to the factory in time.
这家公司告诉《第一财经》YiMagazine，市场监管部门在关停其工厂时曾有解释，本轮整顿的部分动机是为了防止没有资质、产品也达标的工厂私自生产、高价出售，破坏生产秩序。
The company told First Finance Yi Magazine, a market regulator who shut down its factories, that part of the motive for the overhaul was to prevent unqualified, substandard factories from producing, selling at high prices, and disrupting production.
企业方表示理解并支持政府部门规范生产的初衷，但同时希望这种“一刀切”的操作能有所改变。
Businesses say they understand and support government efforts to regulate production, but hope that the "one-size-fits-all" approach will change.
目前湖北与全国都处在抗疫关键时期，许多城市的消耗类医疗物资都陷于紧缺状态。
Hubei and China are in the critical period of fighting epidemic, many cities are in a critical state of consumption of medical supplies.
多位与武汉定点医院的隔离病房和发热门诊医生有直接联系的志愿者告诉《第一财经》YiMagazine，现在部分重点医院的物资有一定保证，但仍有不少医院急缺防护物资，尤其是防护服，“重复使用，用一次性雨衣代替的情况不少见”。
Many volunteers who have direct contact with the isolation ward and the fever clinic doctors at Wuhan Dingdian Hospital told First Finance Yi Magazine that some key hospitals now have certain supplies, but there are still many hospitals that are in urgent need of protective equipment, especially protective clothing, "repeated use, replacement with disposable raincoats is not uncommon."
同样面临这种困境的医用口罩行业，已经获得“特事特办”的支持。
The medical mask industry, which also faces this dilemma, has received support from the Office of the Special Agent.
2月2日，湖北省市场监督管理局、药品监督管理局曾联合发文，在新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情结束前，允许未在境内上市的进口和出口转内销口罩在省内市场销售。
On February 2, the Hubei Provincial Market Supervision Authority and the Drug Administration jointly issued a letter allowing the import and export of non-listed coronavirus to be sold on the provincial market before the end of the pneumonia epidemic.
此前，深圳已经采取了应急备案机制，对于原来生产国外标准口罩用于出口、有能力生产国内标准口罩却未取得相关资质的企业，在产品检验合格后一日内完成备案。
Previously, Shenzhen has adopted an emergency filing system, the original production of foreign standard masks for export, the ability to produce domestic standard masks but not the relevant qualifications of enterprises, within one day after the completion of product inspection.
但是，定点医院医护人员最需要也紧缺的物资——医用防护服，并未被纳入这项“特事特办”的临时规定中。
However, medical protective clothing, the material most needed and in short supply by hospital staff, was not included in the "special case" temporary provision.
