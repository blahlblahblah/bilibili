我和子岚说，在这种黑暗的时候，哪怕一点点的善意，都能给别人带来温暖。
I said to ZiLan, in this dark time, even a little kindness, can bring warmth to others.
哪怕只有一点点的光，也要努力去发出来，去照亮黑暗。
Even if only a little light, but also try to send out, to illuminate the dark.
口述 |余女士整理 |刘朝晖我是子岚的妈妈，因为在快手上播出自己作为武汉市民日常抗疫生活的视频收获百万观看，子岚这个初三小男生一下子在网上“火”了，这让我实在没想到。
Liu Chaohui I was a mother of ZiLan, because I watched a million videos of my daily life as a fighter against epidemic diseases in Wuhan City on the air. I never expected that ZiLan, a junior student, would have caught fire online at once.
1月19日的晚上，我带着孩子去上了补习班，一起吃了宵夜，还和其他同学的家长聊天，讨论是不是带辛苦了一个学期的孩子出去旅游一次，然而大家就觉得形势有点不对。
On the night of Jan. 19, I took my kids to a cram school, had a midnight snack, and talked to my classmates' parents about taking their child on a vacation after a hard semester.
大家决定把补习的课停了，旅游计划也暂时搁置，互相提醒着囤点菜在家里，买一点口罩和消毒用品什么的。
It was decided to suspend remedial classes and travel plans, reminding each other of the need to order at home, buy a mask and disinfectant.
一切来得猝不及防。
Everything caught me off guard.
1月23日早上起来，我从微博上看到武汉封城的消息，一下子挺慌的，因为从来没有经历过这样的事情。
On the morning of January 23, I saw the news of Wuhan Seal on Weibo, suddenly quite panic, because I have never experienced such a thing.
子岚正在家里练琴，我跟他说：哎呀！怎么办呢？城市被封住了。
Zi Lan was practicing at home, I said to him: Gee! What? The city was sealed.
子岚问我：妈妈，封城是什么意思？我说就是不能随便出去了。
Zi Lanasked me: What does the city mean, mother? I just can't go out at will.
结果子岚说：封城有什么了不起的，封什么也封不住音乐！音乐是有力量的，封城封不住欢笑，封不住欢乐！现在想想，子岚当时的这句话让我真的很感动,一直感动到现在。
The result was Zi Lan: What was the meaning of this city, that nothing could be musically sealed! Music is powerful, and the city cannot be sealed with laughter and joy! Now think about that, ZiLan at that time let me really moved, has been moved to the present day.
我一下子平静下来，没有那么慌了，觉得孩子长大了。
I calmed down and felt the child grow up.
也许他是幼稚，是天真，但孩子这样勇敢，也给了我们大人勇气。
Perhaps he is naive, naive, but such a brave child, but also give us adults courage.
我说，好，那爸爸妈妈就陪着你，我们一起试一试，看我们是不是真的可以挺过来。
I said, well, that father and mother accompany you, we try together, see if we really can make it.
就这样，我们全家留在了武汉城里。
In this way, our family stayed in Wuhan city.
封城之后，很多亲朋好友，包括在国外的，都打来电话问我们的情况。
After the closure of the city, many friends and relatives, including those abroad, called to ask how we were doing.
我答复他们，我们就在家里弹弹琴，学习唱歌，还挺安生的。
I answered them, and we played the harp at home, learned to sing, and were quite comfortable.
最重要的是家里没有人生病。
The most important thing is that no one in the family is ill.
好多人不相信，反复问是不是真的呀？后来我就说，我每天拍一段家里的生活视频给你们看看，让你们安安心吧。
A lot of people do not believe, repeatedly asked it is true? Later I said, I take a video of life at home every day for you to see, let you at ease.
子岚在家里练琴我在快手上注册了一个账号，名字叫“我是子岚”。
ZiLan in the home practice piano I quickly registered in the hands of an account number, called "I am ZiLan."
这是我第一次玩这种手机视频软件。
This is my first time playing this mobile video software.
第一天上传了一分钟的视频，主要就是子岚练琴和几张日常照片剪辑组合的。
The first day uploaded a one minute video, mainly Zi Lanqin and a few daily photo clip combination.
后来内容基本就是子岚练琴、练字、锻炼身体什么的，有时候上街买菜，街景也拍几张。
Later the content is basically Zi Lanqin, training, physical exercise and so on, sometimes on the street shopping, street scenes also took a few.
每天上传发布一条，就像在拍一个封城日记，一直坚持到现在。
Uploading and publishing a journal every day is like taking a cityscape diary and keeping it up to now.
正月初一那天，我们在家稍微搞了点仪式，包个饺子，烤个甜品。
On the first day of the first month, we had a little ceremony at home, making dumplings, baking a dessert.
打开手机一看，视频点击量居然上了百万，有几万个点赞。
Open a mobile phone to see, video hits unexpectedly millions of, there are tens of thousands of praise.
评论留言里，是全国各地以及武汉本地的网友在为我们加油，为武汉人民加油。
Comments in the message, is all over the country and Wuhan local netizens refueling us, for the people of Wuhan refueling.
这可能是我第一次感受到网络的力量有如此巨大。
It's probably the first time I've felt the power of the web so much.
我们宅在家里不能出去，但可以感受到很多很多的人的支持和鼓励。
We cannot go out at home, but we can feel the support and encouragement of many, many people.
也许有人会说，这种口号支持是很空洞的，但是你如果真的在这个疫情的中心，你就会觉得就算那一点点鼓励，也是很宝贵的。
Some might say that this kind of slogan support is empty, but if you are really in the center of the epidemic, you will feel that even a little encouragement is valuable.
子岚通过练琴视频为武汉加油子岚从小学音乐，这是他最大的兴趣爱好。
ZiLan through the practice video for Wuhan refueling ZiLan from primary school music, this is his greatest interest.
什么钢琴、木吉他、电吉他都玩，有的时候还打鼓。
What piano, guitar, electric guitar all play, sometimes also playing drums.
在音乐上他还是有一点点天赋的，所以他觉得学习乐器没有那么枯燥，也并不困难，对他来说挺好玩的。
He still had a little talent for music, so he thought it was not so boring or difficult to learn an instrument. It was fun for him.
现在他除了上网课，每天上午和下午都要练琴，差不多两三个小时。
Now he has to practice the piano every morning and afternoon, almost two or three hours, except for the Internet class.
有空我们就陪着他，跟他一起弹啊唱啊，玩到一起。
We will accompany him when we have time, play and sing with him, play together.
子岚在做作业子岚的视频在快手上火了之后，央视的编导打电话给我们，希望以我们的视频再添加点素材制作节目。
ZiLan did homework in the video in the near hand after the fire, the director of CCTV called us, hoping to add a little material to our video production.
2月11日晚上，《武汉：我的战“疫”日记》三集微纪录片在央视纪录频道播出，说的就是子岚和他同城“战友”们的故事。
On the night of Feb. 11, a three-part documentary, Wuhan: My Diary of the Battle of the Plague, was broadcast on CCTV's Record Channel, telling the story of Zi Lan and his fellow countrymen.
憨豆先生”扮演者罗温·艾金森。

为了向奋战在前线的医护人员，以及从四面八方支援武汉的叔叔阿姨们表达感谢，子岚专门和爸爸原创一首吉他曲献给他们。
To thank the medical staff who fought on the front lines, as well as the uncles and aunts who supported Wuhan from all sides, ZiLan dedicated an original guitar song with Dad.
他在片子里说：“每天在新闻里看到这些人和物资，正源源不断地来到武汉，我们心里踏实多了。
He said in the film: "Every day in the news to see these people and supplies, are coming to Wuhan, we feel much more secure.
谢谢大家。
Thank you.
”央视纪录片《快乐的子岚》海报Play片子播出后，亲戚朋友，还有子岚以前的小学老师打电话过来，说没有想到他一下子长得这么大了，印象里他还是一个小孩子。
After the CCTV documentary "Happy Lan," a poster play, relatives and friends, as well as former elementary school teachers, called to say they didn't expect him to grow so big at once, under the impression that he was still a child.
有人问，子岚现在变成“网红”了，你们有什么感想？其实我们和子岚一样，没什么太大感觉，他只是个14岁的初三学生，今后要走的路还长着呢。
Some people ask, ZiLan now become "net red," what do you think? In fact, we and ZiLan, not too much feeling, he is just a 14-year-old junior high school students, there is still a long way to go.
子岚也觉得没什么值得炫耀的，他说，妈妈，我们快手的粉丝才一百多个，没什么了不起的。
Zi Lan also felt nothing to show off, he said, Mom, we have only a hundred fans fast, nothing great.
孩子就是孩子，那天片子播出时，他兴奋地对我说：妈妈你看，电视里有一个子岚，电视外有一个子岚，两个子岚，多好玩。
The child was a child, and when it was shown on the air, he said excitedly to me, Mom, there was an urban lan on TV, and there was an off-screen bran, two brunettes, that was fun.
子岚在观看央视播出的纪录片每天在快手上的记录分享，也让越来越多人走进子岚的生活。
Zi Lan is watching a CCTV documentary that is shared daily on the fast-moving hands, which also brings more and more people into ZiLan's life.
“加油孩子，你是最棒的。
"Come on, kid, you're the best.
”“你们是未来的希望，好好学习是对那些帮你们的人最好的回报。
"You are the hope of the future, and studying hard is the best reward for those who help you.
”“一切都会好起来的，武汉和中国的明天一定会因你们而更加灿烂美好。
"Everything will be fine and Wuhan and China's tomorrow will be even brighter and better for you.
”……网友一声声的支持和鼓励，让我们和子岚都对战胜疫情更加充满希望。
"... netizens voice support and encouragement, let us and ZiLan to overcome the epidemic more hopeful.
孩子和我们每天一起看新闻，每天会问我，今天确诊人数有多少了，今天有没有死亡的人？他会觉得这个数字有点夸张，很可怕。
The child watches the news with us every day and asks me every day how many people have been diagnosed today and whether there are any people who died today.
一开始，他可能还是处于一种天真的状态，有点盲目自信和盲目乐观，觉得无所谓。
At first, he may still be in a state of innocence, a little self-confident and blindly optimistic.
但是二十多天下来，他自己对这个形势有了更深入的认识。
But more than twenty days later, he himself had gained a deeper understanding of the situation.
我告诉他，那些数字曲线，和什么钢产量、粮食产量曲线不是一回事，后面是一个个的人和生命。
I told him that the numerical curves were not the same as those of steel production and grain yield. Behind them were people and lives.
我们虽然比较幸运，没有感染，但是有很多很多痛苦的人，需要去关怀，需要去支持。
We are fortunate not to be infected, but there are many, many suffering people who need to be cared for and supported.
我和子岚说，在这种黑暗的时候，哪怕一点点的善意，都能给别人带来温暖。
I said to ZiLan, in this dark time, even a little kindness, can bring warmth to others.
哪怕只有一点点的光，也要努力去发出来，去照亮黑暗。
Even if only a little light, but also try to send out, to illuminate the dark.
这一点一滴，都能坚定我们的信心。
This bit by bit, can strengthen our confidence.
那天我带他一起出去买菜，路上只有清洁工和交警。
The other day I took him out shopping with only the cleaners and the traffic police.
我跟子岚讲，街上没有人了，只有这些人还在这里坚持，我们应该跟他说一声辛苦了。
I told ZiLan that there was no one on the street, only these people were still here to insist, we should say a hard word to him.
子岚说，对，我们应该让他们一起加油！经过一名环卫工人时，我就喊：辛苦啊，师傅！虽然是我提议的，但我是个大人，对着陌生人这样喊出来感觉有点尴尬，声音特别小。
Zi Lan said, Yes, we should let them cheer together! After passing an sanitation worker, I shouted: Hard ah, Shifu! Although it was my proposal, I was an adult, and it felt a bit awkward and quiet to shout at strangers.
但是子岚这个孩子很单纯，他真的上前大声地对那个环卫工喊：师傅加油！那个环卫工吓了一跳，等转过身来，虽然戴着口罩，但是看得出他特别高兴。
But ZiLan, a simple child, really went forward and shouted to the sanitation worker: Cheer up, Shifu! The sanitation worker started and turned around, although wearing a mask, but he could see how happy he was.
后来子岚遇到的每个环卫工、警察、小区门卫都大声喊：您辛苦了！他们有的笑一笑，或者是点个头，或者是伸出赞的手势，我觉得那种感觉特别好。
Later ZiLan encountered every sanitation worker, police, residential guards shouted: You have worked hard! Some of them smiled, or a bit of a head, or extended a positive gesture, I think that feeling is particularly good.
对孩子来说，这也是一个很难得的成长经历。
It is also a rare experience for a child to grow up in.
子岚母子俩在阳光中的剪影昨天的语文网课，老师布置了一道作业，是改写舒婷的一首诗《祖国啊，我亲爱的祖国》，把它改成《武汉啊，我亲爱的武汉》。
Silhouette of Mother and Child in the Sunshine Yesterday, the teacher assigned a homework, is to rewrite Shu Ting's poem "Motherland, My Dearly Motherland," and changed it to "Wuhan Ah, My Dear Wuhan.
上午十点钟下的课，说是到晚上交作业，结果子岚不到半个小时就写好了。
At ten o'clock in the morning the class said to hand in the homework at night, but ZiLan finished it in less than half an hour.
他把作业拿给我看，一下子又把我给感动坏了。
He showed me his homework and was soon moved by it.
我是江汉关嘹亮悠扬的钟声，百年来回荡在滔滔长江之上。
I am the melodious bell of Jianghan Pass, echoing on the Yangtze River for hundreds of years.
我是矗立在彭刘杨路口的雕像，见证了武昌首义的第一枪。
I was the statue at Peng Liu Yang Junction and witnessed the first shot of Wuchang's first righteousness.
……子岚的作文《武汉啊，我亲爱的武汉》我觉得他写得太好了，我没有想到一个小孩子，对武汉的这些景物如此熟悉，有些地方他都没怎么去过，没想到他对武汉的感情是有这么深沉。
Wuhan, My Dear Wuhan I think he wrote so well that I did not think of a child who was so familiar with these sights in Wuhan, where he had hardly ever been there, and whose feelings towards Wuhan were so profound.
子岚其实作文写得不怎么好，但是这次是完全发自内心情感的写作。
ZiLan actually did not write well, but this time it was entirely from the heart of the emotional writing.
我很惊讶，孩子真的成熟了，长大了。
I am surprised that the child is really mature and has grown up.
我和子岚说，这是你自己的人生，你自己没有意识到，你已经深深地把根扎在这里了，跟这座城市已经不可分割了。
I said to ZiLan, this is your own life, you do not realize that you have deeply rooted here, and the city has become inseparable.
