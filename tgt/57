作者 | 马关夏出品｜深网·腾讯小满工作室欢迎下载腾讯新闻APP，阅读更多优质资讯这个春节，湖北武汉等地陆续发生新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情牵动人心，面对严峻的防控形势，社会各方纷纷行动、驰援武汉。
Not only has the news APP been downloadable, but the Spring Festival, when new coronavirus infections occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, has touched the hearts and minds of the public, who have rushed to Wuhan in the face of severe prevention and control.
企业、明星捐钱捐物的同时，一些普通人也在尽自己所能支持湖北武汉。
While enterprises and stars donate money and goods, some ordinary people are doing their best to support Hubei Wuhan.
一位无法回老家黄冈过年、生活在安徽安庆的95后小伙戴元，他在得知武汉黄冈等地的亲朋好友无法购买到口罩等物资后，找到一些安徽周边的口罩工厂，从二十九、除夕到初一的三天时间已陆续为疫情区的朋友筹集上万副口罩。
Dai Yuan, a 95-year-old man who could not return to his hometown of Huanggang for the Spring Festival and lived in Anqing, Anhui Province, found some masks factories around Anhui after learning that relatives and friends from Wuhan Huanggang and other places could not buy masks.
戴元讲述了自己过去三天为疫情区筹集口罩的两大难点：一方面是口罩货源稀缺，春节期间工厂并未完全处于生产状态，而且很多工厂已面临原材料不足的问题；另一方面，武汉封城后，很多进城的快递通道都被封锁了，物流不如平时畅通，部分顺丰快递目前压在武汉，尚未送达到朋友手中。
Mr. Dai described two of the biggest challenges he has faced in raising masks for the past three days: the scarcity of masks, the fact that many factories are not fully productive during the Spring Festival and that many factories are already facing shortages of raw materials.
“不管工厂有多远，我都去跑”我老家是湖北的，后来因为父母的工作原因定居安徽安庆。
"No matter how far the factory, I went to run." My hometown is Hubei, and later settled in Anqing, Anhui Province because of my parents' work.
过去这些年，我们全家一般都是年三十在安庆过年，大年初一就回到老家湖北各地走亲戚。
In the past few years, my family usually celebrate the New Year in Anqing, on the first day of the New Year returned home to Hubei relatives.
武汉疫情爆发，今年没法回湖北老家，眼看所有事情的变化自己却帮不上忙，心理特别着急。
Wuhan outbreak, this year can not go back to Hubei home, see all the changes in their own can not help, psychological particularly anxious.
我看到新闻消息里疫情区医疗物资特别紧缺，也想尽自己的微薄之力，所以陆续找到了一些安徽周边的厂家，为家乡的亲戚朋友和医疗机构输送物资。
I saw the news that the epidemic area is particularly short of medical supplies, also want to do their own meager efforts, so I have found a number of Anhui around the manufacturers, for the home of relatives and friends and medical institutions to send supplies.
我最开始在网上、在高德地图上搜，看到留有联系方式的口罩厂家，就打电话询问，但是因为在过年期间，很多电话打通了也没有人接。
I started to search the Internet, on the map of Goethe, saw the mask manufacturers with contact information, called to ask, but because during the Chinese New Year, many calls were made and no one answered.
搜集出一些厂商后我统计出了联系方式和地址，然后就开着车在安徽这边找。
After collecting some manufacturers, I calculated the contact information and address, and then drove this way in Anhui Province.
我那天大概开了一个半小时才终于找到了一家还在开工的工厂，但是大家都在忙，工厂里的人都在加工，一些卡车和私人轿车在门外不断装货。
It took me about an hour and a half to find a factory that was still working, but everyone was busy, the people were working on it, and trucks and private cars were loading outside.
我问工厂的人有没有货，对方以为是我自己要买，告诉我没有货，现在摆着的货物和正在加工的货物都已经被预定了。
When I asked the factory people if they had any, they thought I wanted to buy them myself. I told me that they were out of stock and that the goods on hand and those in the process had been booked.
我当时拿不了货很着急，就去和老板协商，告诉他我是给湖北的亲戚朋友买，我们大老远跑过来一定要给我们拿上一些货。
I couldn't get the goods very anxious, so I went to consult the boss, told him I was to Hubei relatives and friends to buy, we came all the way to be sure to bring us some goods.
后来老板给我拿了三千只左右的口罩，这些口罩真的来得特别不容易。
Then my boss brought me about three thousand masks, which really didn't come easily.
我当时以为所有的快递公司都已经停运，但搜索之后发现，顺丰和邮政还可以寄出。
I thought all the courier companies had been shut down, but a search revealed that Shunfeng and postal services could still be mailed.
我找到了离家最近的顺丰营业点，在年二十九（1月23日）晚上，给武汉的亲戚朋友寄了过去。
I found the nearest Shunfeng business, in the evening of January 23, Wuhan, sent to relatives and friends to the past.
他们告诉我口罩在那边的医院、药店都特别紧缺。
They told me that there was a particular shortage of masks in hospitals and pharmacies over there.
越来越多湖北武汉的人通过他们联系到我。
More and more people in Hubei Wuhan contact me through them.
那时候我就在想，接下来不管是什么工厂、有多远，我都去跑，去找货源。
At that time, I was thinking, no matter what factory or how far away, I would run and look for supplies.
通过红十字会把口罩运入武汉后来，我又遇到了新的问题，除了口罩的货源特别稀少，进入湖北省的物流运输通道也发生了变化，武汉封城后，很多进城的通道都被封锁了。
After the mask was brought into Wuhan through the Red Cross, I ran into a new problem. Apart from the fact that the supply of masks was scarce, the logistics transportation routes into Hubei Province changed.
我在网上搜把货物运送进入湖北的方式，也问了湖北的一些亲戚，得知有两条途径把货物运送进入武汉，其中一条是通过红十字会。
I searched the Internet for the way the goods were transported to Hubei, and also asked some of Hubei's relatives that there were two ways to transport the goods into Wuhan, one of which was through the Red Cross.
我有两个北京的朋友也想向武汉捐赠一批口罩，他们去问物流，物流的答复都是已经无法寄入武汉当地。
Two of my friends in Beijing also wanted to donate masks to Wuhan. They asked about the logistics response, which could not be mailed to Wuhan.
刚好我知道通过红十字会可以输送进武汉，我就让朋友去联系红十字会，年初一，这些捐赠的口罩被送到了武汉，可能流向了医疗机构和药店。
I just know through the Red Cross can be sent to Wuhan, I let friends contact the Red Cross, the first day of the year, these donated masks were sent to Wuhan, may flow to medical institutions and pharmacies.
武汉的口罩需求量很大，因为不能反复使用，一次性的一次就需要更换，N95这类口罩，在武汉市内人群多的地方，四小时就需要更换。
Wuhan demand for masks, because can not be used repeatedly, a one-time need to replace, N95 such masks, in Wuhan in the crowd of places, four hours need to be replaced.
因为口罩外有飞沫、有病菌，在摘口罩的过程中可能受到感染，所以不能使用好几次。
Because the mask has droplets, germs, in the process of taking off the mask may be infected, so can not be used several times.
不过武汉之外的地方可以用更长时间。
But places outside Wuhan can take longer.
据我了解，市面上急缺的都是N95口罩，国产的是KN95。
According to my understanding, the market is in urgent need of N95 masks, domestic is KN95.
我之前对口罩的情况不太了解，以为只有N95的才能预防疾病的感染，所以找的全部是N95口罩。
I didn't know much about masks before. I thought N95 was the only way to prevent infection, so I found all the N95 masks.
很多普通的医用口罩都没买，当时以为不管用。
Many common medical masks were not bought and thought they didn't work.
凌晨三点去工厂，但一只口罩都没带回我们所有的货物都是晚上去找的，白天所有的时间几乎都在联系需要口罩的人、填写物流单，物流单的填写非常耗费时间。
We went to the factory at three in the morning, but none of our masks brought back all of our wares for the night. We spent almost all day contacting people who needed masks and filling out logistics forms, which were time-consuming to fill out.
因为需要给每一个快递分清楚种类，口罩本身分很多类，还需要确定数量，扫描二维码，以及跑物流的过程。
Because of the need to separate each express, the mask itself is divided into many categories, also need to determine the number, scan the two-dimensional code, and run the logistics process.
这导致我白天几乎没有时间，只能白天忙完后，回家吃口饭，然后晚上继续搜索物资，跑工厂。
This left me little time during the day to go home for a bite to eat after the day's work, and then continue to search for supplies and run the factory at night.
找工厂的过程很艰辛，天一直在下雨，没有停过。
The process of finding the factory was hard. It rained all the time and never stopped.
工厂里大家都在忙，老板开三倍工资留下部分工人，很少有人理你，都说没有货、没有货。
The factory is busy, the boss three times wages to leave some of the workers, very few people listen to you, said no goods, no goods.
而此时，更多在湖北的人士通过朋友又找了过来问买口罩的事情。
At this point, more people in Hubei through friends to find over to ask about the purchase of masks.
基本上每个人都希望拿到200个左右。
Basically, everyone wants about 200.
kn95口罩价格也涨到6元、8元到10元。
The price of Kn95 masks has also risen to 6 yuan, 8 yuan to 10 yuan.
年三十，我也在搜索货源，一直到晚上才去拜访工厂。
Thirty years old, I was also looking for supplies, until the evening to visit the factory.
那天下着特别大的雨，零散的工厂分布在乡镇漆黑的小路上，很多工厂大门紧闭，偶尔有一两家露出光亮。
It was a particularly rainy day, with scattered factories scattered along the dark lanes of the towns, with many factory gates shut and occasionally one or two bright lights showing.
我很难看清工厂的名牌，只能根据整理好的地址慢慢找。
It is difficult for me to see the brand name of the factory, so I can only look for it according to the organized address.
那天晚上，我带回了数千只口罩。
That night, I brought home thousands of masks.
初一凌晨两三点我们还去找了厂家，但是一副口罩都没拿回来，所有的口罩都被预定了。
Two or three in the morning we also found the manufacturers, but a pair of masks were not back, all the masks were ordered.
而且工厂原材料有限，口罩的生产无法继续。
Moreover, the factory's raw materials are limited and the production of masks cannot continue.
我初二还有一批口罩需要邮寄出去，大概有三五千个，这些口罩都是前几天找到留下的。
I still have a batch of masks to be mailed to my junior high school. There are about three to five thousand of them, which were found the other day.
物流这块，我今天也刚得知有一个免费的绿色输送通道，这是个好消息。
Logistics, I just learned today that there is a free green channel, this is good news.
有几个武汉的朋友找我买的口罩，目前货还没收到，顺丰查询显示货在武汉但无法派送。
Some Wuhan friends to buy my face masks, the current goods have not been, Shunfeng query shows that the goods in Wuhan but can not send.
我武汉那边的亲戚朋友现在都没有什么问题，只是都在家里隔离、不再外出。
I Wuhan side of the relatives and friends are now no problem, only at home in isolation, no longer go out.
我还记得他们第一次收到我的口罩后，都非常感激，为我点赞，我现在可以说是满满正能量。
I remember how grateful they were when they first received my mask, and I can say that I am now full of positive energy.
我今天在继续搜索一次性口罩，希望最好还能找到KN95的，我想再给湖北那边的一些村里寄过去。
I continued to search for disposable masks today, hoping that KN95 would be best found. I'd like to send them back to some villages across Hubei Province.
