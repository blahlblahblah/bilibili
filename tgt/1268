记录改变中的全球文化图景。
Record the changing global cultural landscape.
这是系列报道的第十一篇，我们把视角转向暂且「无恙」的宅人们。
This is the eleventh in the series, and we turn our eyes to the temporarily "safe" homeowner.
今天是你自行隔离的第几天？期间的困惑、愤懑、无奈和乏味，是否找到排解出口？作为没有直接进入现场的旁观者，你又在这场灾难中扮演了什么角色？作家和译者于是自诩「资深宅人」，然而这场始料未及的「宅」却让她忐忑不已：权力和求生欲的双重钳制，失真中的共情，以及不对等信息下滋生的脆弱期待。
What role did you play in the disaster, as a bystander who did not enter the scene directly? The unexpected "house" perturbed her: the duopoly of power and survival, empathy in distortion, and fragile expectations bred by the absence of reciprocal information.
她的个人志也是众生相，而我们，即便明知在柏拉图的「洞穴」中实属身不由己，但也切莫独善其身。
Her personal history is also that of sentient beings, and we, even though we know we are in Plato's "cave," must not be left alone.
我个人史上曾经的最高纪录是 21 天没有出门，当时住的是高层，垃圾不分类，有专用通道。
The highest record in my personal history was 21 days without going out, when I was living in a high-rise, unsorted, dedicated corridor.
如果把不出小区作为不出门的标准，那么，这次（新形冠状病毒肺炎疫情期间）我已破了纪录，并且有几亿人作陪。
If we do not have a small area as a standard not to go out, then this time (during the new coronavirus pneumonia) I have broken the record, and hundreds of millions of people to accompany.
复工后，又有几亿人和我一样在家办公，在家跳操。
When I got back to work, hundreds of millions more were working from home, doing exercises at home, just like me.
这是史无前例的宅人集体生活。
This is the unprecedented collective life of homeowners.
可想而知，宅家对我而言是常态，十多年来，每个长假都是我的最佳工作时间，这次我也给自己安排了每天的工作额度，我感受到了工作带来的催眠感，只有在沉浸到具体工作的某个时间段里，外部世界及其纷扰才似乎能被屏蔽掉。
It is conceivable that homeowners are the norm for me. For more than a decade, each long vacation has been my prime working time, and this time I have set myself a daily amount of work.
我有自己的时间表，有固定的流程，有 to-do-list，用扫除作为解闷和运动，宅得相对自律。
I have my own schedule, there is a fixed process, there is to do-list, using cleaning as a relief and exercise, homestead relatively self-discipline.
但这次宅得心烦意乱。
But this time the house was distracting.
前期遥望封城，囤货隔离；中期每天一睁眼就看数据，凌晨抢菜，夜半被死讯气到胸闷，种种不可思议搅乱思路；现已进入后期，数据和网传引发的情绪波动渐渐变小了，怕死的冲动平息，一如往常的是害怕日后的遗忘，害怕活得不像自己希望的那样 —— 比如，希望自己有能力改变什么。
At this late stage, the mood swings caused by data and Internet transmissions are gradually decreasing, and the fear of death subsides, as is often the case with the fear of later forgetfulness and the fear of not living as you wish - for example, to be able to change something.
在某个时间点，我突然重新想起自己曾有过的执念：对于世事，我们无法知道真相。
At some point in time, it suddenly occurred to me that I had been thinking that we could not know the truth about the world.
如果真相是巨量的具象组成，但谁都没有上帝视角。
If the truth is a massive representation, no one has a God's perspective.
然而，真相只是「一」，如同人类是一个共同体，而我们依然是无明颠倒的碎屑，拼不出那个一。
However, the truth is only "one," as human beings are one community, and we are still the scraps of incomprehension that do not spell that one.
一开始不想重看 2011 年的《传染病》，后来双黄连火了，忍不住去重温了裘德洛的连翘美梦，2020 年再看实在寒心。
At first, she didn't want to reread "Infectious Diseases" in 2011, but then Shuang Huangliang went back to her dream of Forsythia in Jude Law.
人的眼前永远有官僚的谎言和丑态，永远有平庸之恶，永远有自私和贪欲，但若没有切肤之痛，人就不会记住教训，但只要幸存了能活下去，却又势必沉沦在无明颠倒之中。
The human eye is always full of bureaucratic lies and ugly, always mediocre, always selfish and greedy, but without the pain of the skin, one will not remember the lesson, but as long as one survives, it will sink into oblivion.
且不说幸存者，死者也会痛，死者不能决定自己的死亡时间 —— 你可以正解或误解。
Leaving aside the survivors, the dead also suffer, and the dead cannot decide when they will die - you can either explain it or misunderstand it.
我顺便说说《德古拉》，德古拉告诫过这一届新娘：死后不要火葬，会疼。
I mention Dracula by the way, Dracula admonishes this generation of brides not to be cremated after death, it hurts.
他和新娘在墓地里约会，听得到地下窸窸窣窣的呼喊。
He went out with the bride in the graveyard and heard them crackling.
德古拉也是旷世宅人。
Dracula, too, is a loner.
早年我就安妮· 赖斯的系列小说写过一篇关于小说影视中吸血鬼的进化史，现在得加上一笔：2019 年 BBC 版的德古拉很快学会了利用互联网，连新娘都是用 Tinder 找的，可方便呢。
In the early years of Anne Rice's series, I wrote about vampires in fiction, and now I must add that Dracula of 2019, the BBC version, quickly learned how to use the Internet. Even brides can find it with their Tinder.
互联网时代的德古拉尝到了虚无主义者的美味，也尝到了当今绝症的滋味，有癌的血会让他吐 —— 类似吸血鬼的还有吸食人类痛苦和恐惧的妖怪，J.K. 罗琳写过，斯蒂芬 ·金也写过。
Dracula, in the Internet age, has tasted nihilistic delicacy and a taste of today's incurable diseases, cancer-like blood that spits on him - vampire-like monsters who suck on human pain and fear, as J. K. Rowling wrote, and Stephen King wrote.
但后者的幽默在于：想象了用传染病打败妖怪的情节 —— 吸了麻疹患者后，妖怪们纷纷倒下，几近团灭。
But the latter is humorous: imagining an infectious disease defeating a genie - after sucking on a measles patient, the genie falls to the brink of extinction.
换言之，只有当传染对象是妖怪时，这才有幽默可言。
In other words, there is humor only when the object of infection is a genie.
传染对象是人类时，随之泛滥的是荒谬和绝望。
When the object of infection is human beings, absurdity and despair follow.
对我们这些史无前例的网民宅人来说，没有互联网平台就根本宅不下去。
For those of us who are unprecedented netizens, there is no place to live without an Internet platform.
衣食住行方方面面都要借助数码平台，菜场都在网上，房产中介叫你网上看房，楼上的小朋友跟着屏幕里的体育老师跳绳，还有数不清的网络求助，还有来自南极、尼日利亚、巴西、印度、英国、日本……的数不清的坏消息。
Food, clothing, housing and all aspects of the digital platform, vegetable farms are online, real estate intermediary call you online room, upstairs children follow the screen of the sports teacher skipping rope, there are countless network help, there are from Antarctica, Nigeria, Brazil, India, the United Kingdom, Japan... innumerable bad news.
众生相也全在「网眼」里 ——A 提前从澳门回上海，因为担心停航，更担心赌场成为重灾区，兴奋的赌客的每只手每张嘴每只眼里都带着高光般的病毒；B 的老婆突发急性肠胃病，半夜急诊，自己却因为体温超过 37 差点儿被隔离；C 成为第二批支援武汉的医护人员；D 组织了价值数百万的卫生物资，在红十字会碰壁后，直接通过地方政府，包车运送到孝感的医院；E 坐困江城，用尽资源为亲朋好友寻求解救机会；F 抑郁症复发，不想出门拿药，但脑海中的幻听愈来愈响；G 被调用基层返沪人员排查工作，累得半死；H 开始毕业后第一次大规模阅读，恶补索尔尼仁琴托尔斯泰加缪阿伦特，以求伦理道德哲学层面的速成更新；I 焦虑自己的微型企业可能撑不过这一季度；J 从节前开始一天三顿给儿子做饭也打破纪录，黔驴技穷；K 独自在家闷到不行，邀昔日 K 友云对唱，各自对着手机嘶吼；L 幸亏年前促销时购入划船机一台，每日闹钟定时，陆地行舟 4 公里；M 在银行发放贷款，最近在家加班，日夜无休随叫随到……与此同时，好友圈从长假旅行摄影大赛变成厨艺摄影大赛，一切生活本相打回原形，职业女性重拾家务，男主外的意思回归到买菜拿快递倒垃圾。
I'm worried that the casino will become a disaster area, every hand and every eye of the excited gambler is carrying a virus of high quality.
多少人突然明白了：私人生活的范畴实际上庞杂无际，美好生活依附于那么多平凡的劳动者，因而是脆弱的，也因而是伟大的。
It suddenly dawned on many that the sphere of private life is indeed vast, that the good life depends on so many common laborers, and is therefore fragile, and therefore great.
21 世纪的生活新秩序，在某些元素的暂时缺失状态下，得到了最鲜明的彰显。
The new order of life in the 21st century, under the temporary absence of some elements, has been most vividly demonstrated.
每一个群都在复述已知的内容，每一条朋友圈都在输送已知的情绪，几乎都在奥斯卡颁奖前夜忘了还有这茬儿，忘了东京还要举办奥运会，对特朗普、普京或英国皇室的关心额度也都给了病毒。
Each group repeats what is already known, and each circle of friends conveys its known emotions, forgetting almost all the stubble on the eve of the Oscars and forgetting that Tokyo will host the Olympics, as well as the amount of attention paid to Trump, Putin, or the British royal family.
所以，宅的状态根本不是独处，而是自己和无数叙事主体的虚拟共情。
Therefore, the state of the house is not alone at all, but their own and countless narrative subject virtual empathy.
「网眼」构成的共同体有一样的漏洞，也有一样的出口。
The "mesh" of the community has the same loopholes, there are the same exports.
依托于网的宅，表面似可无所不知，亦可知无不言，实则恰恰相反。
Relying on the net of the house, the surface seems to know everything, but also know nothing, in fact the opposite.
实在界的硬核只有被虚拟化后才能持续存在。
The hard core of the real boundary can only last if it is virtualized.
「网眼」里的一切都挺像柏拉图洞穴里的影像 —— 宅人要有这样的自觉。
Everything in the "mesh" resembles the image of Plato's cave - the homestead's self-awareness.
主动宅的人通常珍爱孤独，独处让他们自在。
People in active homes often cherish solitude and let them be at home alone.
但这次很容易感受到一点：孤独并不天然存在，谁也无法脱离外部存在，他们的孤独只是美学意义上的精神意境。
But this time it is easy to feel that loneliness is not a natural existence, no one can be separated from the external existence, their loneliness is only the aesthetic sense of spiritual artistic conception.
现在能够宅的人，其实是这次席卷亿万人的大事件中的幸运者，没有任何资格抱怨无聊或沉闷。
Those who can now live in homes are in fact the lucky ones in a great event that has engulfed hundreds of millions of people and are in no position to complain about boredom or boredom.
现在能够宅的人，都是暂时没有直接进入现场的旁观者，对现场发生的一切只能通过被剪辑过的视频音频文字来解读，被投喂人工饲料或天然原材料，在权力和求生欲的双重钳制下顺服地宅家，在失真中共情，在片面的想象中期待达成共同的期望。
Those who are now able to live there are bystanders who have no direct access to the scene. Everything that happens at the scene can only be read through clipped video and audio text, fed artificial feed or natural raw materials, submissive homeowners under the duel of power and desire to live, sharing emotions in distortion and expecting common expectations from one-sided imaginations.
虚假的幸福感很容易获得，但伪善更值得警惕。
False happiness is easy to get, but hypocrisy is even more alarming.
义愤填膺之后，会不会发现气愤没有明确的目标？陪伴绝望的哭泣之后，会不会问自己你做了什么？在独自一人的信息处理过程中，你有过怎样的质疑和研判？在每天从早到晚不间断的重磅消息密集涌来的特殊时期里，你如何扩增信息处理的能力，抑或只是简单粗暴地覆盖？会因为没做什么而愧疚吗？会因为无能为力而挫败吗？相比于无法知道真相而有的无力感，这种无能感会不会让你更无力？病毒发生在每一个病人体内、悬置并移动在时空中的过程就像死亡本身一样无法复述。
Is it true that anger has no definite purpose? After crying in despair, do you ask yourself what you have done? How do you increase your ability to process information, or are you simply overshadowed by the constant barrenness of information from day to night? Will this incompetence make you less able to say it in every patient, hanging and moving in time and space like death itself?
真相的这一角也将永远缺失，也是孤独的注脚。
This part of the truth will always be missing, but also a footnote to loneliness.
被动的宅人自觉辛苦，要给所有的情绪制造出口，但出口也会像陷阱：停止思考或停止动作，就是陷阱。
Passive homeowners consciously toil to create an outlet for all emotions, but exports can also be a trap: stop thinking or stop acting, that's a trap.
被动吸收的情绪迅速饱和，手指做的最多的动作只是转发；转了谣言再转辟谣，或再转造谣式辟谣，转了生机再转死讯，转了谎言再转为了覆盖谎言的谎言，转了愤怒再转悲愤，但也转了不少笑话 ——仅仅都是转发。
Passive absorption is rapidly saturated, with the most action of the fingers simply relayed; rumors are turned back, rumors are turned back, rumors are turned back, rumors are turned to life and then to death, lies are turned to lies that cover lies, anger turns to grief, but there are many jokes - just relays.
被投喂的感觉让我想起不久前曾凝视的壁炉之火，真正的柴薪烧起来比你想象得快，火舌舔过的动作既无情又温柔。
The feeling of being fed reminded me of the fireplace I had been staring at some time before. Real wood was burning faster than you thought, and the tongue of fire licking was merciless and gentle.
柴薪烧光了之后，我们就用酒精块投喂它，让它迅速燃烧。
When the wood was burned out, we threw it in pieces of alcohol and let it burn quickly.
但你不能说那火是纯然虚假的。
But you can't say that the fire is pure and false.
当然，无论怎样的生活状态都不影响你仰望高贵。
Of course, no matter how the state of life does not affect you look up to the noble.
在仰望的姿态中意识到自身的卑微，或洁净或污浊的卑微。
In the attitude of looking up to realize their own humble, or clean or dirty humble.
但我最近也见到沉沦于仰望的人，造神般打造高贵的承载者，架空了真相的卑微，乃至卑鄙。
But I have also recently seen people sinking in the hope of creating noble bearers, the humbleness of the truth, even despicable.
简而言之，资深宅人的我不曾这样忐忑地宅过。
In short, senior homeowner I have not so perturbed the mansion.
