At 2400 hours on February 6, 31 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government) and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps had reported a cumulative total of 31,161 confirmed cases, cured a cumulative total of 28,985 hospital discharges and 28,985 (4,821 of them severe), with a cumulative total of 636 deaths and 26,359 current suspected cases, according to CNHS.
累计追踪到密切接触者314028人，尚在医学观察的密切接触者186045人。
A cumulative total of 314,028 contacts were traced, with 186,045 close contacts still under medical observation.
累计收到港澳台地区通报确诊病例50例，其中香港死亡病例1例。
A total of 50 confirmed cases were reported from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, including one case of death in Hong Kong.
2、新增确诊病例数继续下降湖北新增确诊病例数已经是连续两天下降。
The number of newly confirmed cases continues to decrease. The number of newly confirmed cases in Hubei Province has declined for two consecutive days.
考虑到其正在全力消化此前积累的未收、未检病例，这个结果难能可贵。
Given that it is struggling to digest the uncollected and undetected cases that it has accumulated so far, this result is commendable.
非湖北地区连续三天平稳，这或许意味着非湖北地区正在接受病毒二代传播的考验。
Non-Hubei areas have been stable for three consecutive days, which may mean that non-Hubei areas are being tested by second-generation transmission of the virus.
3、确诊病例增长率继续下降有网友认为增长率受基数大幅增加影响，不能说明问题。
3, the confirmed case growth rate continues to decline Some netizens think the growth rate is affected by the base increase greatly, cannot explain the problem.
其实增长率的变动率恰恰是预测趋势的重要参数，基数大了反而更加可靠。
Indeed, the rate of change in growth rates is an important parameter in forecasting trends, and a larger base is more reliable.
增长率究竟增长还是下降会带来质的差别。
Whether growth rates increase or fall makes a qualitative difference.
湖北的增长率继续下行让我们看到希望。
The continued decline in Hubei's growth rate gives us hope.
这意味着确诊病例翻倍的时间从前一阶段的3、4天可望延长到一周以上。
This means that the doubling of the number of confirmed cases is expected to extend beyond one week from three to four days in the previous phase.
非湖北地区的病例翻倍时间则将延长到10天以上。
In non-Hubei areas, the doubling time will be extended to more than 10 days.
4、待排查疑似病例存量微涨5、密切接触者追踪力度和存量这个追踪系数可以直观理解为平均每一个确诊病例会追踪到多少人。
Tracing Strength and Inventory of Close Contacts This tracking factor can be intuitively understood to mean how many people will be tracked for each confirmed case.
不难看出非湖北地区追踪力度远远大于湖北。
It is not difficult to see that non-Hubei tracking much stronger than Hubei.
我们对非湖北地区的防控增强了信心，也感受到湖北面临的各种压力。
We have strengthened our confidence in the prevention and control of non-Hubei areas and feel the pressures facing Hubei.
同时我们也看到尚在追踪观察者数已经趋于平稳。
At the same time, we also see that the number of observers still tracking has leveled off.
这个存量数据同样是一个趋稳的信号。
The stock data is also a sign of stabilization.
注：密切接触者追踪系数=每日追踪的密切接触者增量/每日新增确诊病例数6、治愈人数远超病死人数累计治愈出院人数与病死人数继续拉大差距。
Note: Close Contacts Tracking Factor = Close Contact Person Increments / Number of New Confirmed Cases per Day tracked on a daily basis. The number of Healers far exceeds the Number of Deaths Accumulated Cure The gap between the number of discharges and the number of deaths continues to widen.
湖北也在三天前实现治愈人数反超病死人数后继续向好。
Hubei also achieved a cure three days ago after the number of excess deaths continued to improve.
小结：小编多句嘴，人们通常认为拐点在山顶，但数学定义的拐点其实在山腰。
People usually think that the inflection point is at the top of the mountain, but the inflection point of mathematical definition is actually on the mountainside.
先有山腰的拐点才会有山顶。
There is a hillside inflection point before there will be a peak.
这里我们采用常识用语来使用“拐点”。
Here we use common sense terms to use the inflection point.
所以现在只说疫情增势趋缓，让我们期待数据进一步明确。
So let's just say that the epidemic is slowing down, and let's look for more clarity.
