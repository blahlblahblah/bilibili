在这样的大灾面前能感受到整个国家都发动起来了，航空公司、海关都给了很多便利。
In the face of such a disaster can feel the entire country to mobilize, airlines, customs have given a lot of convenience.
希望能有更多的慈善组织参与其中，每一个体都是渺小的，集合起来才能发挥更大的能量。
Hopefully, there will be more charitable organizations involved, and each of them will be small and will be able to work with greater energy.
口述 | 晓　苏(化名)整理 | 巴　伊2月13日清早8点，我一人推两辆满满当当的行李车，终于出现在浦东国际机场，我在法国采购的 7大箱医疗物资终于顺利通关，这里面有几千只口罩（具体数量我已经记不得了）、200套医用防护服，测温枪、酒精棉，这是我在法国扫货的成果，全部捐献给这次疫情的重灾区之一——温州，能让在一线战斗的医务和社区工作者用上，我也心安了。
At 8 a.m. on February 13, I finally showed up at Pudong International Airport with two full suitcases. I was able to clear thousands of medical masks (I can't remember exactly how many), 200 medical suits, thermostats, and alcohol cotton, one of the worst affected areas in France.
浦东国际机场，满满7箱医疗物资顺利通关第一批货被美国拦在了海关我是温州人，早年定居法国，现在上海经商。
Pudong International Airport, full of seven boxes of medical supplies smoothly passed through the customs The first batch of goods was stopped by the United States.
1月23日武汉封城以后，群里的求助信息就多了起来，都是缺口罩、缺防护服等医用物资，自己因为经商，社会关系广一点，别人有难，能帮则帮，那就开动起来吧。
Wuhan on January 23, after the closure of the group more help information, are gaps in the cover, lack of protective clothing and other medical supplies, because their business, a wider social relations, other people in trouble, can help help, then start it.
1月26日，联系到黑龙江有个医疗圈的朋友，手里有一批N95口罩。
On January 26, a friend of Heilongjiang's medical circle was contacted with a batch of N95 masks.
我说：“你都给我吧！”他说，“不行，我这虽然疫情没那么严重，但也要留一点，以防万一。
I said, "You give it to me," he said. "No, I don't think it's that serious, but I want to save a little for a rainy day.
”最后商量下来先给我2000个救急，那也是不小的胜利啊（最后这批口罩都捐给了嘉兴的医院）！发在聊天群的求助信息更好的消息是，他正在向美国订购大批的口罩和防护服，那是太好的机会，我就跟单吧。
Finally, I was offered 2,000 first, which was no small victory (the masks were donated to Jiaxing's hospital)! A much better message from the chat group was that he was ordering huge quantities of masks and protective clothing from the United States.
我汇总了几个地方的需求，大概5万个N95口罩、1万套防护服，把订单传给他，一切看似操作顺利。
I put together a list of needs in several places, about 50,000 N95 masks, 10,000 suits, and passed on orders to him, and everything seemed to go smoothly.
1月29日传来消息，N95口罩、医用防护服等已被美国列为战备物资，禁止出关……在群里汇总后的大单，没想到被美国海关禁止出关转去巴黎一家家药房扫货美国这条路断了，去欧洲找找吧，这是我蹦出的第一个念头。
January 29, news that the N95 mask, medical protective clothing has been listed by the United States as war materiel, banned from customs... aggregate in the group, did not expect to be banned by the United States Customs clearance to Paris pharmacies sweep the United States this road broke, look for Europe, this is my first thought.
本来就订好了年后去法国的机票，主要是出席法国前总理拉法兰的新书发布会。
Air travel to France was scheduled for the next year, mainly to attend the book launch of former French Prime Minister Frans Raffarin.
疫情当前本不想去了，现在这个时点，我一中国人出现在巴黎，会不会被隔离？在朋友们的期盼下，更多的是为了采购口罩吧，2月1日我踏上了法国的旅程。
At this point in time, will I be quarantined when I appear in Paris? In the hope of friends, more for the purchase of masks, February 1 I embarked on a trip to France.
法国人心真大，出关时就给了我一张告知单，其他啥措施也没有，大街上也没人戴口罩，我心想这下口罩可能有戏。
The French are so popular that they gave me a notice when they went out. There was nothing else. No one on the street was wearing masks. I thought this mask might be useful.
落地巴黎后的疫情告知书向朋友一打听，口罩、防护服等物资法国也已禁止出口，向厂家批量订购看来是没希望了，这时国内又来了信息催了，“目前最需要N95口罩，如果不能批量订，人肉几千个也可以。
After landing in Paris to ask friends about the epidemic situation, respirators, protective clothing and other supplies have been banned from export France, the bulk order from manufacturers seems to be hopeless, when the domestic information rush, "the most need of N95 masks, if not bulk order, thousands of human meat can also.
”看来国内的情况万分紧急。
The situation in the country seemed extremely urgent.
人刚到巴黎，催单就来了我打电话给三位法国朋友，他们也天天盯着手机，关心中国的疫情，和他们一说这事，就更来劲了，当即组成扫货四人组。
No sooner had the man arrived in Paris than a reminder arrived than I called three friends from France, who were staring at their cell phones every day, concerned about the epidemic in China.
分析了一下当前形势，获得口罩差不多也就三条途径：一家家药房人肉扫货、网上订购、托一家医院的采购经理买。
After analyzing the current situation, there are almost three ways to get a mask: a grocery store, an online order, and a hospital purchasing manager.
Play法国朋友帮忙运货去药房扫货是2人一组，一个开车一个进店购买，先从住处附近开始。
French friends help transport goods to the drugstore Sweeper is a group of two, one driving into the store to buy, starting with the neighborhood of the residence.
一开始法国朋友开车、我进店，跑了几家一个都没买到，我想是不是因为我是中国人，人家知道口罩紧缺，不卖给我啊；接下去就换了一下策略，我开车、法国朋友进店，还是一个都买不到；我们几乎跑遍了整个巴黎，最后找到一家药房，20欧分的口罩卖到了5欧元，也仅剩5个，朋友硬拖着我不让买，说这涨价也太厉害了。
At first French friends drove, I went into the store, I didn't buy any. I wondered if it was because I was Chinese and people knew I was short of masks, so I couldn't buy one.
货源都在网上后来我发现，其实货源有，都在网上，而且都在个人手里，早有人先下手为强，在巴黎扫了一遍货。
The source is in the net later I found out, in fact, the source of goods, are online, and are in the hands of individuals, someone has been strong, in Paris swept goods.
我的这批货基本都是几十个、几百个的在网上加价收回的，而且货主基本都是在欧中国人。
My goods are basically dozens, hundreds of online premium recovery, and cargo owners are basically in Europe and China.
我先拿到200套防护服，谈价到45欧元一套（原价15欧元），后来又联系到4000套防护服在一个德国华人手里，加价到65欧元，还要先打款再发货，实在不放心，最后没敢拿。
I got 200 suits first, negotiated 45 euros (15 euros), then connected 4,000 suits to a Chinese German, added 65 euros to the price, and then sent the money, I didn't dare take it.
医疗物资奇缺，坐地开价本无可厚非，可国难当头，总感觉不是滋味。
Medical supplies are in short supply, the price should have been justified, but the country is difficult to bear, always feel bad.
算了，不说了，反正货也到手了，不就是钱的事吗。
Forget it, don't say, anyway the goods also got, is not money matter.
再看看我的3位法国朋友，天天忙里忙外，为武汉加油，为温州加油，为中国加油，为一个与他们毫不相干的国度忙碌。
Look at my 3 French friends, busy every day in addition to refueling for Wuhan, Wenzhou refueling, for China refueling, for a country that has nothing to do with them.
Play法国朋友喊加油找法国前总理帮忙2月10日，我如约出席法国前总理拉法兰（Jean-Pierre Raffarin）的新书发布会，这位慈祥的老人向来对中国人民怀着友好的感情，新书也是关于中国的。
2007-3-1 15: 48 French Friends Call for Help Former French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin, a kindly old man who has always been friendly to the Chinese people and whose new book is about China, was announced on Feb. 10.
出席法国前总理拉法兰的新书《辩证看中国》发布会可我时刻牵挂着国内的疫情，觥筹交错之间，脑子里只有口罩口罩。
France's former Prime Minister Raffarin's new book Dialectically Look at China, but I was always concerned about the epidemic in the country, Cheering between, mind only mask mask.
在发布会间隙，我终于屏不住向前总理大人求助，老人家得知情况后说，法国政府的援助（应该有口罩和防护衣）在前几天已经发往中国，他让我和他的助理接洽，看看是否还能搞到货源。
After hearing that the French government's aid, which should include masks and protective clothing, had been sent to China the other day, he asked me to contact his assistant to see if we could get supplies.
他还说，你们中国人平时看起来挺松散的，一到关键时候就能拧成一股绳，中国一定会战胜疫情的。
He added that you Chinese usually seem quite loose, when the time comes to join together, China will certainly overcome the epidemic.
Play拉法兰助力中国抗疫视频进关的梗和红会的章最后整整打包了7大箱物资，怎么托运怎么进关呢？回程是东航的航班，我找到了东航某经理，说明了一下情况，一听说是国内急需医疗物资，二话没说就给我开了绿灯，很顺利上了飞机。
2007-08-19 19: 48 2007-11-19 19: 19: 00 2007-11-19 19: 19: 00 2007-11-19 19: 19: 00 2007-11-19 19: 19: 00 2007-08-19 19: 19: 00 The back flight was an East Airways flight, and I found a manager of China Eastern Airlines, explaining the situation.
在国内的朋友赶紧给我查资料怎么通关，国家已经开了急需医疗物资进口绿色通道，我这属于“捐赠物资－免税进口模式”，国内需要受赠方的证明，本来我已联系好了温州医科大学作为受赠方，但被告知，只有红十字会才能作为受赠方。
My friends at home hastened to find out how the materials passed through customs. The country has opened a green passage for urgently needed medical supplies. I belong to the "donated goods-duty-free import model" and the country needs a certificate from the grantee that I had contacted Wenzhou Medical University as a grantee but was told that only the Red Cross could be a grantee.
这个我就不愿意了，这次湖北红会在疫情中的表现都被曝光了，我辛苦筹来的物资不能再交给红会了。
This I do not want, this time Hubei Red Cross in the outbreak of the performance have been exposed, my hard-earned supplies can no longer be handed over to the ICRC.
后来得知红会只是办个手续，物资可以定向捐赠给温州医科大学，这才放心。
Later learned that the Red Cross is only a formality, materials can be targeted donation to Wenzhou Medical University, then rest assured.
还有就是需要三证齐全（厂家执照、医疗器械注册证、检测报告），我这都是扫货来的，哪有什么证明？这个让医院专业人员去识别吧，最后做了解释，海关也理解，让我签了一份承诺书，顺利通关。
Then there is the need for three certificates (manufacturer's license, medical device registration certificate, testing report), I have come here to sweep the goods, what proof? This let the hospital professionals to identify it, finally explained, the customs also understand, let me sign a commitment, smooth customs clearance.
去温州的快递车已经在机场等候，办完交接手续，直接拉去温州市人民医院。
The express train to Wenzhou has been waiting at the airport to complete the transfer procedures, directly to Wenzhou People's Hospital.
温州市红十字会受赠证明这几天群里一直有表扬我，感谢我的帖子，其实这一次我做得太少了，很惭愧。
Wenzhou Red Cross has been a gift to prove that I have been in the group of praise, thank my post, in fact this time I did too little, very ashamed.
前面那个大单子能签下来就好了，但我也理解，这样的瘟疫面前全世界人民都紧张，都要留点余粮。
I wish the big list in front of me could be signed, but I also understand that people all over the world are nervous in the face of such a plague.
这样的满巴黎扫货，我也是头一次。
This is the first time I've ever had a Parisian sweep like this.
我在法国十几年了，人家天天在“老佛爷”门口排队，我也从来没去扫过货，没想到这次为了一个小小的口罩，满巴黎跑。
I have been in France for more than 10 years, people in the door of the "old Buddha," I have never been to sweep the goods, I did not expect this time for a small mask, run all over Paris.
本来过年想给自己添一些衣物，现在啥都没买，我那只红色旅行箱里还塞了两包口罩。
I wanted to add some clothes for myself over the New Year, but now I haven't bought anything, and I've got two bags of masks in my red suitcase.
在这样的大灾面前能感受到整个国家都发动起来了，航空公司、海关都给了很多便利，也希望有更多的慈善组织能参与其中，每一个体都是渺小的，集合起来才能发挥更大的能量。
In the face of such a disaster can feel the entire country to mobilize, airlines, customs have given a lot of convenience, but also hope that more charitable organizations can participate, each is small, the collective can play a greater energy.
