人们见面没有了往日的寒暄和热络，捐赠物资后连握手也取消了，向空军军医大学第二附属医院捐赠四箱N99口罩那次，对方郑重地向陈龙敬了一个他“见过最标准的军礼”，“当他们的手举起的那一瞬间，我不禁热泪盈眶。
When people met without the usual pleasantries and contacts, even shaking hands after donating supplies, donated four cases of N99 masks to the Second Affiliated Hospital of the Air Force Medical University, the other side solemnly assured Chen that he had "seen the most standard military salute," and when their hands were raised, tears filled my eyes
”本文首发于南方人物周刊文 | 本刊记者 格林编辑 |周建平 rwzkjpz@163.com全文约2487，细读大约需要5分钟陈龙在捐助物资前战士的子弹一个多月来，在艰难的抗击疫情过程中，不少民营企业通过捐款、转产、驰援物资、有序复工等方式主动承担起了社会责任，中国奥园集团股份有限公司便是其中一家。
This article begins at Ren Editing & # 44; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & nbsp; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
前线最急缺的是物资。
What is most urgently needed on the front lines is supplies.
中国奥园集团驰援武汉物资工作组组长、奥园志愿者防疫队队长戴远程说，彼时已是2月中旬，离武汉封城过去二十余天，全国乃至全球的物资源源不断运至武汉，但仍然不够。
It was mid-February, more than 20 days after the end of the city of Wuhan, a steady flow of supplies from all over the country and the world continued to flow to Wuhan, but still wasn't enough.
中国奥园是国内最早支援武汉的知名地产企业之一，也是首家直接从境内外采购口罩等医疗急缺物资并运抵捐赠到武汉疫区前线的企业。
China's Olympic Garden is one of the earliest support to Wuhan's well-known real estate enterprises, is also the first directly from abroad and domestic procurement of surgical masks and other urgent medical supplies and arrived at the front of the enterprises donated to Wuhan epidemic areas.
早在1月26日，奥园集团采购的N95等医用口罩就陆续运抵武汉，直接捐赠到江夏区疫情定点收治医院。
As early as January 26, the Orchard Group procurement of N95 and other medical masks have arrived in Wuhan, directly donated to the Jiangxia disease sentinel hospital.
截至2月18日，中国奥园通过各种渠道在全球采购了逾110万只N99、N95、FFP1/2、一次性医用口罩，以及医用防护服、额温枪等，其中绝大部分运抵并捐赠给武汉、广州、珠海、梅州、贵州、香港等地。
As of February 18, the park has procured more than 1.1 million N99, N95, FFP1 / 2, disposable medical masks, and medical protection suits and frontal-temperature guns through various channels, the vast majority of which have arrived and donated to Wuhan, Guangzhou, Zhuhai, Meizhou, Guizhou and Hong Kong.
除夕当天，刚刚抵达江苏盐城老家准备过年的戴远程收到了集团领导的消息：请尽快组织医疗物资运送到武汉疫区前线，“要快！”他立即打电话询问具体指示，回复是“集团资源充分授权你调度、捐赠上不封顶”。
On New Year's Eve, Dai Yuan, who had just arrived in his hometown of Yancheng, Jiangsu Province for the New Year, received a message from the group leader: Please arrange the delivery of medical supplies to the front line of Wuhan epidemic area as soon as possible.
戴远程是媒体人出身，主责是品牌管理中心，从来没有做过采购，“按照规矩来讲，所有采购必须要走合同的。
Dai remote is the origin of the media, the main responsibility is brand management center, has never done procurement, "in accordance with the rules, all procurement must go through the contract.
”戴远程说，跳过合同等程序将带来的风险他不是不知道，但“过半天东西就没了”。
Dai said he was not unaware of the risks involved in skipping programs like the contract, but "things will go away in half a day."
最后他和团队决定将所有流程简化，“只要你告诉我你那边有货，把货源图片和资格证发图给我，我找医院朋友确认，我拼人品和信任，你给我账号，我打钱给你。
Finally, he and the team decided to simplify all the procedures, "as long as you tell me you have the goods there, send me the source picture and the qualification card to me, I ask the hospital friend to confirm, I fight for character and trust, you give me the account number, I give you the money.
”物资与病毒赛跑，一刻也不能耽搁，但运输途中的信息更新不及时、不准确，为捐助增添了不少麻烦。
Material race against the virus cannot be delayed for a moment, but updates in transit are not up to date and accurate, adding to the hassle over donations.
有一回戴远程从印度采购了一批四万只欧盟标准的医用口罩，第二天便发货往新德里机场。
Once Dai procured a batch of 40,000 EU-standard medical masks from India and shipped them to New Delhi airport the next day.
在接下来的四五天时间里，物流消息断了，“有人跟我说，货已经运到东南亚了，有人说货已经运到广州了”，始终没有确切消息，“就像一个战士天天在打仗，突然有这么三天干着急，没子弹了，压力还是挺大的。
Over the next four or five days, the logistics news broke down. "Someone told me that the goods had arrived in Southeast Asia and someone said they had arrived in Guangzhou."
”最后，他辗转找到一名印度留学生志愿者，在新德里机场的仓库里找到了那批物资，几百个箱子摞在一起，被遗忘了。
Finally, he ran to an Indian student volunteer and found the consignment in a warehouse at New Delhi airport, hundreds of boxes stacked together and forgotten.
那位志愿者啃着方便面守了两天一夜，直到物资全部运上飞机，辗转从云南清关入境，终于在采购后的第11天，元宵节那天捐赠到医疗机构。
The volunteer nibbled at the instant noodles for two days and nights until all the supplies were loaded onto the plane, cleared the customs from Yunnan, and finally donated it to the medical institution on the 11th day after the purchase.
春节期间，每天早上6点起床之前，已有几百条消息发到手机里等着戴远程去处理，它们大多来自同事、志愿者、供货商、物流商、医护人员，一步步紧盯物资。
During the Spring Festival, hundreds of messages, mostly from colleagues, volunteers, suppliers, logistics providers and health-care workers, have been sent to the phone to be processed remotely before getting up at 6: 00 a.m. each morning.
不仅脖颈受累、视力下降，六年来体重上下浮动不超过一公斤的马拉松业余爱好者戴远程，10天里一下子胖了九斤多。
Not only is he suffering from neck damage and vision loss, but he is a marathon amateur who has fluctuated up and down less than a kilo for six years and has put on more than nine pounds in 10 days.
1月26日下午4点，六箱N95口罩运抵武汉公司驻地，随后送达江夏市第一人民医院和江夏区中医院。
January 26 4: 00 p.m., six cases of N95 masks arrived in Wuhan company premises, and then sent to Jiangxia First People's Hospital and Jiangxia District Chinese Hospital.
戴远程终于松了一口气，他发了一条朋友圈：“第一批货到达武汉，送到医护人手中。
Dai finally breathed a sigh of relief. "The first batch arrived in Wuhan and was delivered to the paramedics.
工作群里一片欢呼，志愿者群里更是点赞一片。
There were cheers from the work group and even more praise from the volunteers.
我的眼泪马上掉下来。
My tears came down at once.
既然捐赠驰援的牛吹出去，再难也要做成，这就是考验执行力。
Since the donation of cattle out, no matter how difficult it is to make, this is the test of execution.
原本可以跟一些同行一样，例行宣布捐钱，至少不会犯错没有风险。
It would have been like some of our peers to routinely announce donations, at least without risk.
但是可能我有私心，我们主业是地产，跟医疗物资生产尤其是医用口罩八竿子打不着，但是我们有公益自信，也有社会责任。
But maybe I am selfish, we are mainly real estate, and medical supplies production, especially medical masks do not fight, but we have public self-confidence, but also have social responsibility.
前线有需要，我们就有足够的专业力量，高效执行做到更好。
If the front line needs it, we have the expertise to execute it efficiently and effectively.
”戴远程从江苏到广州，继续跟进物资捐助情况。
Mr. Dai traveled from Jiangsu to Guangzhou to follow up on material donations.
女儿在机场给他抓拍一张照片，戴远程略显疲惫，但他说“这是我喜欢的样子”标准的军礼所有物资到达武汉的最后一棒，由陈龙接手，他是集团湖北区域公司投资经理，主动请缨在武汉清点、收发物资。
"This is the way I like it." Chen Long, the investment manager of Hubei Regional Company, volunteered to take stock and send materials to and from Wuhan, where he had chosen to make an inventory.
在那段时间，陈龙接到过很多物资求助的电话：定点医院武汉大学中南医院打来过，病患剧增而口罩告急，医疗物资极度缺乏，医生们通宵奋战，对方几乎是带着哭腔给他打电话；武汉市公安局宣传科致电求助，公安机关工作人员常常暴露在高危地方，感染风险极大，但他们的物资需求未获关注……为了尽快将物资送到捐赠对象手上，陈龙常常开着自己12月新提的车运货，口罩太多了，就想方设法找货车，还有一次用上了公交车。
During that time, Chen received many calls for help from the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. The patient surged and his mask was in short supply. The doctors battled all night, and the propaganda department of Wuhan Public Security Bureau called.
货运不完的时候，则需要妥善保管。
When the shipment is not finished, we need to keep it properly.
有一天170多箱口罩到达，直到凌晨1点才捐赠完30箱，其余全部摆在公司写字楼下，陈龙独自将它们搬到了位于15层的公司里，一直搬到凌晨4点。
One day, more than 170 cases of masks arrived and only donated 30 boxes at 1: 00 a.m., leaving the rest under the company's office building. Chen Lung moved them alone to a company on the 15th floor until 4am.
人们见面没有了往日的寒暄和热络，捐赠物资后连握手也取消了，向空军军医大学第二附属医院捐赠四箱N99口罩那次，对方郑重地向陈龙敬了一个他“见过最标准的军礼”，“当他们的手举起的那一瞬间，我不禁热泪盈眶。
When people met without the usual pleasantries and contacts, even shaking hands after donating supplies, donated four cases of N99 masks to the Second Affiliated Hospital of the Air Force Medical University, the other side solemnly assured Chen that he had "seen the most standard military salute," and when their hands were raised, tears filled my eyes
”因为出门对接物资这件事，家人担心不安全，陈龙每天都要不断地说服他们，然后晚上一回到家就立即全身消毒。
Fearing for their safety as they went out to dock the supplies, Chen constantly persuaded them to do so every day and disinfected himself as soon as he got home at night.
迎接春天民营企业是国民经济的重要组成部分，随着国内疫情逐渐好转，许多民企开始有序复工。
Welcome to spring private enterprises is an important part of the national economy, with the gradual improvement of the domestic epidemic, many private enterprises began to orderly resumption of work.
奥园开发上线了“奥园购房宝”，提供线上营销渠道；对全国五大区域91个项目123个案场作出全方位部署；发挥在物业方面的优势，上门消毒、团购物资，还为湖北荆州部分社区的困难家庭捐助了约8吨蔬菜，每份10斤，可满足约1500个家庭的需求；为到岗员工提供口罩等防护物资，提倡错峰上下班、私家车及步行通勤，提供午餐至工位、电梯定时消毒等。
The park provides on-line marketing channels, conducts all-round deployment of 91 project 123 cases in five regions of the country, gives full play to the advantages of property, disinfection and group purchase materials, and provides protective materials such as masks for some 1,500 families, promotes staggered working hours, private cars and walking commuting, provides lunch to work place, regular elevator disinfection, etc.
根据新浪财经报道，2月12日，奥园健康生活集团员工到岗率达80.5%。
On Feb. 12, 80.5% of employees of the Orchard Healthy Lifestyle Group showed up, according to Sina Financial Times.
“比起前线的英雄，我们做的不算什么；相比其他企业捐了几个亿，这些产品价值算多少钱？我们有些同事说说出去没面子，人家捐了几百万几个亿，我们企业才捐了这么一点口罩，价值算起来也只有大几百万。
"What we have done is nothing compared to the heroes on the front line; how much are these products worth when compared to the hundreds of millions of dollars donated by other companies? Some of our colleagues talk of losing face.
然后我就跟他说，我觉得我一点都不丢人，我们给前线送去最为亟需的救命医疗物资。
Then I told him that I didn't feel humiliated at all and that we were sending the most urgently needed life-saving medical supplies to the front.
我们的努力和捐赠都用在了刀刃上。
Our efforts and donations have been directed to the blade.
”戴远程说，“不管是在武汉，还是在广州、上海、北京、浙江，都是前线。
"Whether in Wuhan, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing or Zhejiang, it is the front line," he said.
我很自豪，我和我身边的同事在关键时候有挺身而出的勇气，而且还有解决困难的各种办法。
I am proud that I and my colleagues have the courage to come forward at critical times and that there are ways to resolve difficulties.
”1月31日，戴远程从老家江苏前往广州总部，有几天早上他开半小时车到公司去，落实捐赠刚刚到达的口罩物资，与同事见面只是远远点头，但他从不觉得冷清。
On January 31, Dai traveled from his hometown of Jiangsu to Guangzhou headquarters, where he drove to the company for half an hour one morning to confirm the donation of newly arrived masks and simply nodded to his colleagues, but he never felt lonely.
2月10日复工那天，中国奥园的所有员工收到了来自集团董事会主席的一封信，信里说：没有一个春天不会到来。
On the day of the resumption of work on February 10, all employees of the Olympic Garden in China received a letter from the chairman of the group's board, which said: "There is no spring that does not come.
