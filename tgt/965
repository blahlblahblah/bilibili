文｜备备最近，多起因病患隐瞒自身病情或接触史导致大规模感染的新闻让人们对出门和返工多了几分担忧。
More recently, news that patients are concealing their condition or exposure has led to large-scale infections has raised some concerns about going out and reworking.
医院之外，还有更多从事着不同职业的人正在各自的岗位上维持着乡村和城市的疫情防控。
In addition to hospitals, there are many more people in different occupations in their respective posts to maintain the rural and urban disease prevention and control.
大军是一位90后刑警，进入警队近四年，这是他第一次在执行任务时穿上医用防护服，追捕的对象不是犯罪嫌疑人，而是逃跑的疑似病例。
The Army is a 90-year-old Interpol, into the police force for almost four years, this is his first time on duty wearing medical protective clothing, not the suspect, but the suspected case of escape.
以下是他的口述：时间是六点半左右，正吃着年夜饭，我接到队长打来的电话：“年夜饭吃得怎样？快点吃，一个病例跑掉了，来一趟吧。
The following is his dictation: It was about 6: 30, eating Chinese New Year's Eve dinner, I received a call from the captain: "How was the dinner? Eat fast, a case ran away, come on.
”电话里，队长说的是“病例”，我没来得及问是确诊的病患，还是疑似病例。
On the phone, the captain said "case," and I didn't ask if it was a confirmed patient or a suspected case.
这是我婚后的第二个春节，我和妻子以及两家的父母在一起吃团年饭，不想让他们担心，我只说单位临时有事要回去，再说上两句吉利话，就匆忙出门。
This is my second Spring Festival after marriage, my wife and my parents have a reunion dinner, do not want to let them worry, I just said that the unit temporarily have to go back, and then a word of Jilly, hurried out.
没来得及吃完的年夜饭到大队后，办公室里只有队长一个人在值班，他指了指办公室门口的一个纸箱，说：“把它们带上吧。
Before he could finish his New Year's dinner, the captain was on duty alone in the office. He pointed to a cardboard box in front of the office and said, Take them with you.
” 纸箱里是医用防护服，从警三年多，我还是第一次穿上医用防护服。
Carton contained medical protective clothing, which I had worn for the first time since I had been a policeman for more than three years.
队长简要说明了情况：逃跑的是一位湖北籍女性，和家人一起到本市旅游，曾途经武汉。
The captain outlined the situation: the escape is a Hubei female, and family together to travel to the city, once through Wuhan.
今天下午在家人和一位朋友的陪同下到本市医院就医，拍出来的CT显示肺部有感染，被判断为疑似病例，需要隔离，在转至定点医院的过程中趁医护人员不注意，私自逃跑，医院当即报警。
Accompanied by his family and a friend, he went to the city's hospital this afternoon. The CT scan showed an infection of the lungs, which had been diagnosed as a suspected case requiring isolation. During the transfer to the designated hospital, the hospital ran away without medical attention and the hospital immediately alerted the police.
我们市的防控措施启动算是比较及时的，年前关停了多个销售活禽的市场，本地新闻每日向市民们普及戴口罩和勤洗手的卫生习惯。
The launch of control measures in our city is relatively timely, closed a number of markets for live poultry sales, local news daily to the public wearing masks and frequent hand-washing habits.
尽管如此，防控工作还是很严峻，我所在的南方沿海城市，每年冬季会迎来大批游客，有些是来短期旅行，还有一部分会留下过年。
Still, control is tough, and my southern coastal city receives a large number of visitors each winter, some for short trips and some for the New Year.
随着疫情发展，到大年三十的时候，我们市已有确诊的病例。
With the development of the epidemic, by the year 30, there have been confirmed cases in our city.
因此队里对于疑似患者的情况很重视，要是疑似病例在逃走途中再接触其他的人，情况会更糟糕。
Therefore, the team is very concerned about the suspected patients, if the suspected case in the escape route to contact other people, the situation would be worse.
警队首先和患者取得联系，她说自己并没有离开城区，正在返回医院的路上，但路面监控显示，她和家人坐着朋友的车，正驶入广州。
The police first contacted the patient, who said she had not left the city and was on her way back to the hospital, but road monitoring showed that she and her family were driving into Guangzhou in a friend's car.
离开办公室，我去接另一个分局的同事，是我的一位师姐。
Leaving the office, I went to pick up a colleague from another branch office who was one of my teachers.
因为疑似病例是女性，我们有规定，必须要有女性侦查员陪同才能开展工作。
Since the suspected case is a woman, we have a rule that a female investigator must accompany us to carry out our work.
师姐也是在家吃年夜饭吃到一半被拉回队里的，她了解的情况比我还少，我一边开车一边跟她解释原委。
My sister was half-eaten at home, and she knew less than I did, so I explained it to her as I drove.
在我们赶往广州前，本地疾控中心的几位值班人员已经提前出发，并通知广州当地的派出所和疾控中心。
Before we left for Guangzhou, several local CDC duty officers had already left early and informed the local police station and CDC in Guangzhou.
从我所在的南方沿海小城市往广州方向的车辆很少，道路比以往显得更冷清，远处零零星星有烟火。
The traffic from my southern coastal town to Guangzhou is few and far between, and the roads are cooler than ever, with fireworks in the distance.
我半开玩笑地跟同事说：“别人在家过年，我们出来追病患，真是很特别的年三十。
I half jokingly said to my colleagues: "other people at home New Year, we go out to chase patients, it is really very special.
” 警察这职业嘛，类似的突发情况经常有，我和家人都习以为常。
"The police profession, such emergencies often occur, I and my family are used to it.
去年3月份，我新家入伙，临时有任务把我叫回警队，自己的入伙饭也没吃上。
Last March, I joined the new family, temporary assignments to call me back to the police force, his admission did not eat.
因此年三十晚上接到领导的电话我倒也没有什么别的想法，只想赶紧把任务执行完，尽快赶回家。
Therefore, I received a call from the leadership in the evening, I do not have any other ideas, just want to hurry to finish the task, as soon as possible home.
同事拍的远处的烟花一个多小时的路程，我们赶到增城的一处住宅区，根据监控掌握的车辆情况，疑似病例和两位随行人员就在小区里。
Colleagues photographed the distant fireworks more than an hour away, we rushed to a residential Zengcheng, according to the monitoring of the vehicle, suspected cases and two entourage in the small community.
这个小区规模大、住户密集，不希望给其他居民造成不必要的恐慌，我们先向小区物业要了业主的登记表，确认病患所在的楼栋和门牌号，再跟疾控中心的人员讨论行动方案。
This small area is so large and densely populated that we do not want to cause unnecessary panic to the rest of the population. We first asked for the owner's registration form, identifying the building and number of the patient, and then discussed the course of action with CDC personnel.
其实备选方案只有两个，患者配合我们工作当然是最好的，患者若是坚决反抗，我们也只能强制把人带走，毕竟疫情危急。
In fact, there are only two options, patients to work with us is certainly the best, if the patient is determined to resist, we can only force people to take away, after all, the outbreak is critical.
我和同事，还有三位疾控中心的工作人员进入楼道。
I entered the hallway with my colleagues and three CDC staff.
我们事先协商好，专业的劝解工作由警方完成，疾控人员负责监控病患的身体状况。
We agreed in advance, professional counselling was done by the police, and the disease control staff monitored the patient's physical condition.
我上去敲门，虽然穿着防护服，心里还是略紧张的。
I went up to knock, although wearing protective clothing, or a little nervous.
从警将近四年，我也曾接触过患有肺结核一类等高传染性疾病的犯罪嫌疑人，这些时刻的心态差不多吧，说一点不怕是假的，但肯定不能后退。
Nearly four years from the police, I have also come into contact with suspected perpetrators of highly infectious diseases such as tuberculosis. The mentality of these moments is similar, no fear is false, but certainly can not retreat.
我们的行动有严格的规范，我对自己的职业素养还是有信心的，只要合理操作，基本可以避免传染风险。
Our actions have strict norms, I still have confidence in their professional quality, as long as the reasonable operation, basically can avoid the risk of infection.
要说当时还有什么别的想法，可能就是对于疑似病例逃跑的行为感到气愤吧，对自己和他人都是不负责任的。
If there was any other thought at the time, it might have been anger at a suspected case of running away, irresponsible for itself and others.
来开门的是一个女生，她是患者的朋友，患者和家属就是乘坐她的车来到增城的。
To open the door is a girl, she is a friend of the patient, patients and family members are in her car to Zengcheng.
看见门口站着穿着防护服的警察，她情绪倒是很平稳，马上就明白是怎么一回事。
Seeing a policeman in protective clothing standing at the door, she was in a calm mood and immediately understood what was going on.
疾控中心的人先初步登记屋里人的健康信息。
People at the CDC register the residents' health information first.
屋里有三个人，疑似病例、疑似病例的丈夫，还有来开门的女生。
There were three people in the room, suspicious cases, suspicious husbands, and girls coming to the door.
病患有咳嗽的症状，但看上去精神还挺好。
The patient had symptoms of a cough but looked in good spirits.
为保持安全距离，我们坐在餐厅，他们三人待在客厅的沙发上。
To keep a safe distance, we sat in the dining room and the three of them stayed on the sofa in the living room.
起初三个人都是满不在乎的样子，觉得警察在小题大做。
At first all three looked careless and thought the police were making a fuss.
他们不同意离开小区，想办法找各种借口。
They did not agree to leave the community and tried to find various excuses.
被诊断为疑似病例的女生小声辩解：“走的原因是一个人在医院里过年三十，太孤单。
The girl, who was diagnosed with a suspected case, said in a low voice: "The reason to go is that a person is in the hospital in his thirties, too lonely.
”她还接着说：“大过年的，你们穿着防护服也太夸张，我今天也没看到过谁穿防护服。
"She went on:" It's too big of you to wear protective clothing for the New Year, and I haven't seen anyone wearing it today.
”患者的丈夫也附和：“今天她去隔离，我一个人过年三十，也不是个事儿吧。
"The husband agreed:" Today she went to quarantine, and it's not a matter of me being alone in my thirties.
再说了，这病传染真有那么厉害么？我看我们自己吃点药就能好，不需要去医院隔离。
Besides, is the infection really that bad? I think we can take some medicine ourselves without having to go to the hospital for isolation.
”除此之外，患者和另外两人还担心现在三个人一起去隔离，医药费太高，负担不起。
In addition, the patients and two others feared the cost of the drugs would be too high for the three of them to be separated.
病患和随行人员当时的态度，让我挺生气的，但是现在回想起来， 或许那时的防控宣传还不到位，他们真的没有认识到疫情的严重性，他们也是受害者。
I was angry at the attitude of the patients and entourage, but in retrospect, maybe the prevention and control propaganda was not there, they really didn't realize the severity of the epidemic, they were victims.
我抑制住个人情绪，语气严肃：“现在你的身体不好，已经被诊断为疑似，还到处乱跑，很有可能会感染其他人，如果到时候你被确诊，还造成他人被感染，要承担刑事责任的。
"Now that you are not in good health, have been diagnosed as suspicious and run around, there is a good chance of infecting other people, and if you are diagnosed by that time and cause another person to become infected, you will be held criminally liable.
”“大年三十，你们的心情呢也不是完全不能理解，但是配合隔离治疗才是对的。
"" Thirty years of age, your mood is not entirely incomprehensible, but it is right to cooperate with the quarantine treatment.
” 师姐在一旁安抚这三个人。
"Her sister soothed the three men.
也许他们对我市的医疗水平不信任，所以才想跑到广州？我心里也琢磨着各种的可能性，继续耐心劝返。
Perhaps they do not trust the medical standards of our city, so I want to run to Guangzhou? I also thought about the possibilities, continue to patiently persuade.
夜里11点多，在我和同事轮番劝解下，疑似病例和另外两人才逐渐明白事情的严重性，表示愿意听从疾控中心人员的安排，在广州就地隔离治疗。
More than 11: 00 at night, after my colleagues and I in turn persuasion, the suspected case and two other people gradually understand the seriousness of the matter, expressed their willingness to follow the CDC arrangements, in-situ quarantine treatment in Guangzhou.
“现在你也不用怕孤单，你们全部需要隔离治疗，一块在医院过年。
"Now you don't have to be alone. You all need isolation, a New Year in the hospital.
” 我最后对疑似病例说。
'I concluded with the suspected case.
从我们进屋，到病患以及另外两位密切接触者愿意跟我们离开，前后花费一个多小时，时间听上去有点长，对我们来说，这已经属于快速完成任务。
From the moment we entered the room to the moment when the patient and two other close contacts were willing to leave with us, it took us more than an hour, which sounded a bit long, and for us it was a quick task.
跟随疾控中心工作人员把疑似病例和两位密切接触者送往广州的定点医院，我们本次的任务才算是顺利完成。
Following CDC staff to send suspected cases and two close contacts to the designated hospital in Guangzhou, our mission was successful.
那天返程到家大概是凌晨两三点吧，妻子早已睡下。
It was about two or three o'clock in the morning on the way home.
平时晚上回单位值班，我都是到早上8点半下班，所以第二天早上妻子还问我，怎么这么早就回来了。
I usually go back to work at night, I work until 8: 30am, so the next morning my wife asked me why I came back so early.
作为警察的家属，我的父母和妻子对我的工作都很支持，平时不怎么过问。
As a family member of the police, my parents and wife are very supportive of my work and usually don't pay much attention to it.
刚回去的那两天，我跟妻子说，年三十回单位值班的时候着凉了，最好我们先分房睡，吃饭也要分餐，别传染给你。
I just returned to the two days, I told my wife, when 30 units on duty when the cold, it is better for us to sleep separately, also to eat meals, not to infect you.
汇报完工作，我如实告诉家人，我曾触过疑似患者，准备在家隔离，再三叮嘱爸妈不要太担心。
After reporting the work, I truthfully told my family that I had touched suspected patients, ready to isolate at home, repeatedly told parents not to worry too much.
好消息是，经过广州定点医院的隔离观察和诊断，我在年三十晚上追捕的疑似病例患上的不是新冠肺炎，另外两人也相继解除医学观察。
The good news is that after isolated observation and diagnosis at Guangzhou Ding-point Hospital, the suspected case that I sought in the evening was not Newcastle Pneumonia, and two others were released from medical observation.
现在十四天的隔离期就要结束，我没有不良症状，马上能回到工作岗位了。
Now that the 14-day isolation period is coming to an end, I have no symptoms and will be back at work.
我不在岗的日子里，警队的同事们继续在防疫的一线工作，连续破获了几起售卖口罩的诈骗案。
During my absence, police officers continued to work in the frontline of the epidemic prevention programme and uncovered several cases of mask fraud.
执行本次任务之前，我们市还有过一次疑似病例从医院逃跑的案例。
Before this mission, our city also had a suspected case of escape from the hospital.
居家自我隔离期间，我也看到一些因病人隐瞒自己的行动路线或病情，导致多人感染和隔离的新闻。
During self-imposed isolation, I also saw news of patients hiding their course of action or illness, leading to multiple infections and isolation.
我觉得普通人在没有掌握足够的讯息时，对于“被诊断为疑似”可能第一时间是手足无措，加上认知不足和一点私心，会在没有恶意的情况下做出错误的选择。
I think the average person who doesn't have enough information may be confused about being diagnosed as "suspicious" in the first place. Coupled with a lack of awareness and a little selfishness, they can make the wrong choices without malice.
“追捕”这个词可能不太恰当，我们希望做的是让这部分人有机会补救自己的错误。
The word "pursue" may not be appropriate. What we want to do is give this group of people a chance to make amends for their mistakes.
当然也有一部分人做出非常恶劣的行为，比如制售假口罩、故意向他人传播病毒等等。
Of course, some people do very bad things, such as making fake masks, deliberately spreading the virus to others, and so on.
我的工作性质决定了我会比身边的人看到更多暗面，还是那句话吧，一点不怕那是假话，但我不能后退。
It is the nature of my work that makes me see more of the dark side than the people around me, or that sentence, not afraid of the falsehood, but I cannot retreat.
