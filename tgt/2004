全国多数省区已实现“零新增”，统计上未见疫情卷土重来证据，也未发现意味着疫情死灰复燃的个案文/《财经》数据研究员徐进 图/《财经》视觉中心编辑/谢丽容今天是农历二月二“龙抬头”。
Most provinces and autonomous regions have achieved "zero new additions." Statistics show no evidence of a resurgence of the epidemic, nor have they found any cases that suggest a resurgence of the epidemic.
按北方农村传统，今起春耕大忙开始，下地干活儿，期盼一个好年景。
According to the tradition of the northern countryside, from now on plowing busy start, work in the fields, looking forward to a good year.
习主席昨天发表重要讲话部署统筹推进新冠疫情防控和经济社会发展：关于新冠疫情防控讲了七点，再次强调湖北、武汉保卫战和全力做好北京疫情防控；关于经济社会发展讲了八点，其中“复工复产”在两个小标题中出现。
Xi made an important speech yesterday on planning and promoting the prevention and control of the new crown epidemic and economic and social development. He emphasized once again the defense of Hubei and Wuhan and made every effort to prevent and control the Beijing epidemic.
小编认真学习领会。
Little editor learns to understand carefully.
下面看看今天的疫情数据。
Let's look at the epidemic data for today.
一、累计确诊病例：全国总病例数有望控制在8万例左右截至2月23日24:00，全国累计报告确诊新冠肺炎病例77150例。
I. Cumulatively confirmed cases: The total number of cases nationwide is expected to be under control at around 80,000. As of 2400 on February 23, a total of 77150 new cases of pneumonia have been reported nationwide.
以下为分区趋势图。
The following is the zoning trend chart.
图1.1红线和黑线显示我们在和“死神”赛跑！图1.2武汉以外地区的趋势线平顶已经清晰，目前可以看出：国内非湖北地区累计病例将停留在13000例以内，湖北非武汉地区将在19000例以内，武汉将在48000例左右。
Fig. 1.1 The red and black lines show that we are in a race with death! Figure 1.2 The trend line outside Wuhan is clear, and it can be seen that the cumulative number of cases in non-Hubei areas will remain within 13,000, in Hubei non-Wuhan region, within 19,000, and in Wuhan, about 48,000.
最主要的变数是，这个新冠肺炎究竟是像SARS一样不留长尾，还是会如指数函数所示的拖出一条长长的尾巴（最近有专家有此担心）？亦或介于两者之间？目前从非湖北地区数据看很可能不会拖出一条长尾，即便有，也会是很细的一条。
The main variable is whether the new pneumonia has a long tail, like SARS, or a long tail, as suggested by the exponential function (as some experts have recently feared), or somewhere in between? At present, the non-Hubei data are unlikely to produce a long tail, or even a very fine one, if any.
二、新增病例：全国多数省市零新增，北京连零两日，湖北武汉继续下降图2国内非湖北地区新增病例进一步降至11例，平均每省（市区）0.4例。
The number of new cases dropped further to 11 in non-Hubei areas of China, with an average of 0.4 cases per province (urban area).
此前出现监狱集中爆发病例的山东、浙江各1例。
Previously there were 1 case in Shandong and 1 case in Zhejiang Province.
零新增省市24个，占4/5。
There were 24 new provinces and municipalities, accounting for 4 / 5.
北京连续两日“零新增”，这里面有一个重要因素，当当网病例被追踪隔离观察的82人迄今尚无确诊病例。
An important factor in Beijing's two-day series of "zero new cases" is the fact that 82 people whose Internet cases have been tracked and quarantined have yet to be confirmed.
按习主席部署：广大低风险地区要尽快将防控策略调整到外防输入上来，全面恢复生产生活秩序；中风险地区要依据防控形势有序复工复产！图3湖北非武汉消化数据调整因素后回到下降轨道。
The general low-risk areas should adjust the prevention and control strategy to the input of outer defense as soon as possible and restore the order of production and living in a comprehensive way. The medium-risk areas should resume production according to the situation of control and control.
维持向好趋势。
Maintain the positive trend.
图4武汉不负期盼，吸纳“尽收尽检尽治尽隔”增量，并消化数据调整因素后再呈下降趋势。
Figure 4 Wuhan does not live up to expectations, absorb "as much as possible to cure all the isolation" increment, and digestion of data adjustment factors after a downward trend.
据23日新华网，武汉在为期3天的拉网式大排查中。
According to Xinhua on the 23rd, Wuhan in a three-day pull-in screening.
排查、转运、送治“四类人员”3502人。
"Four categories of personnel" were screened, transferred and treated.
包括：确诊患者559名、疑似患者820名、发热患者283名、密切接触者1840名。
These included: 559 confirmed patients, 820 suspected patients, 283 febrile patients and 1,840 close contacts.
与统计数字相印证。
Corroborated with statistics.
三、确诊病例增长率：非湖北地区增速进一步“趋零”，湖北及武汉重新确认下降趋势图5国内非湖北地区增长率降至0.1%以内。
The rate of increase of confirmed cases in non-Hubei areas is further "zero," and Hubei and Wuhan reconfirm the downward trend.
湖北非武汉地区降至0.29%，武汉降至1%以内。
Hubei non-Wuhan region fell to 0.29%, Wuhan to less than 1%.
确认全面向好趋势。
Acknowledge the overall positive trend.
四、密切接触者追踪：湖北及武汉的追踪力度强势提升图6湖北这个指标还在爬升！近三日的滑动平均数更显示其升势强劲：追踪比已进一步提高到20左右。
Close Contacts Tracing: Hubei and Wuhan Tracking Strength Grow Strong Figure 6 Hubei is still climbing! The sliding average of the past three days shows a strong rise: the tracking ratio has further increased to around 20.
中央领导在最近讲话中也再次强调动员社区力量做好流调的重要性。
In recent speeches, the central leadership also re-emphasized the importance of mobilizing communities for mobility.
图7湖北和非湖北地区都在继续下降，意味着可规模化释放更多医疗资源、社会人力资源和隔离空间投入到新的密切接触者追踪隔离上。
Fig. 7 Both Hubei and non-Hubei regions continue to decline, meaning that more medical resources, social human resources, and isolated spaces can be released at scale and invested in new close contacts.
五、疑似病例：增量、存量都在下降图8湖北（含武汉）新增疑似病例继21日出现一次高点后连续两日向下，确认武汉“尽收尽查尽治尽隔”努力取得成效。
Figures 8 Hubei (including Wuhan) a new suspected case after a 21-day high after two consecutive days down, confirming Wuhan efforts to "do everything possible to find out."
图9湖北在拉网排查取得成功后，连续两日下降，印证“拉网筛查”战果。
Fig. 9 Hubei after the success of screening, two consecutive days of decline, confirming the "pull screen" results.
六、在院治疗人数：继续成规模释放病床床位图10在院治疗人数存量下降，继续成规模释放病床床位。
In-patient treatment: continuation of the large-scale release of bed chart 10 The number of hospital treatment in the stock of decline, continue to release beds on a large scale.
推测出的“湖北确诊未入院”人数仍在下降。
The number of people diagnosed as unhospitalized in Hubei province is still declining.
七、病死率、治愈率图11病死率已连续提高三周，看来还会持续。
Illness and Cure Rate Figure 11 The fatality rate has risen for three weeks in a row and seems to continue.
这里有病死发生时间与新确诊增加不同步的因素（非湖北地区），也有救治能力和医疗资源因素（武汉）。
There are the factors that increase the time of disease death and new diagnosis (non-Hubei area), but also the ability of treatment and medical resources (Wuhan).
图12治愈率以更快速度上升。
Fig. 12 The cure rate is increasing at a faster rate.
让我们和死神赛跑！八、新增出院和新增确诊图13.1新出院人数与新确诊人数图13.2新增确诊病例数和新增治愈病例数继续维持剪刀差，核心医疗资源继续得到规模释放。
New discharges and new diagnoses 13.1 The number of new discharges and the number of newly diagnosed cases. Figure 13.2 The number of newly confirmed cases and the number of new cases cured continue to maintain the scissors gap and core medical resources continue to be released at scale.
小结：湖北及武汉数据调整后重新确认向好趋势。
Summary: Hubei and Wuhan data adjusted to reconfirm the trend toward good.
全国多数省区已实现“零新增”，统计上未见疫情卷土重来证据，也未发现意味着疫情死灰复燃的个案。
Most provinces and autonomous regions have achieved "zero new infections," with no statistical evidence of a resurgence of the epidemic or any cases indicating a resurgence of the disease.
可以期待在“毫不放松抓紧抓实抓细防控工作”前提下，“统筹做好经济社会发展各项工作”，落实分区分级精准防控策略，推动企业复工复产将加快。
We can expect that under the premise of "making every effort to achieve economic and social development in a comprehensive way," we will implement the strategy of zoning and precise control, so as to accelerate the resumption of business operations.
