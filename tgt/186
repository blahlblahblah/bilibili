记者 | 张峰 编辑 |沈小山1月31日，何晓丽发现“北京王洋全球影迷会”定向捐赠给湖北麻城市人民医院的2000个一次性医用口罩被麻城市红十字会“拒收”了。
Chen Xiaoli found on January 31 that 2,000 disposable medical masks donated by the Beijing Wang Yang Global Film Club to Hubei Massachusetts People's Hospital were "turned down" by the Massachusetts Red Cross.
根据快递单号显示，这批1月26日从广东江门顺丰寄出的物资在1月31日8点42到达麻城市麻城营业点，9点09分由快递员派送，收件人为麻城市红十字会主任张仁波。
The shipment, which arrived in Massachusetts at 8: 42 a.m. on January 31, was delivered by courier to Zhang Renbo, director of the Red Cross Society of Massachusetts.
根据快递员郑先生的说法，当天上午麻城市新型冠状病毒肺炎指挥中心的一位工作人员到达营业点后，因为这批物资没有提前预付邮费，是“到付”，表示“没有办法报销。
A staff member of the new coronavirus pneumonia command centre in Massachusetts arrived at the store that morning and, since the goods had not been prepaid in advance, they were "paid in cash," saying "there is no way to reimburse them.
”只能先堆放在快递公司仓库。
They can only be stored in the express company's warehouse.
一般这种情况，郑先生表示会做拒收处理，退还货物。
In this case, Mr. Zheng said he would refuse to accept the goods and return them.
何晓丽说，因为是特殊时期，并且运送的为疫情紧缺物资，供货方和她考虑为了保障货物安全到达，选择了到付的方式。
He said that because it was a special period and because of the shortage of supplies for the epidemic, the supplier and she decided to pay in order to ensure the safe arrival of the goods.
而麻城市红十字会主任张仁波在接受南都周刊记者采访时表示，并不存在拒收物资现象。
However, Zhang Renbo, director of the Red Cross Society of Massachusetts, told Nandu Weekly that there was no denial of supplies.
由于近日接收物资频繁，上午由自己的同事进行接收该批2000个口罩的物资，因为工作人员“工作失误”导致产生误会，已经在31日下午四点左右进行了物资接受，并向捐赠人道歉。
Due to the frequent receipt of supplies in recent days, my colleague took delivery of the 2,000 masks in the morning, and apologized to the donor for the misunderstanding caused by the "work error" of the staff.
至于工作人员是否提到“拒收是因为无法报销”，张仁波表示并不清楚。
Zhang said it was not clear whether staff members had mentioned that "rejections are due to non-reimbursement."
最终，经过近六个小时的协商沟通，这笔179元的运费由捐赠方承担，物资由麻城市红十字会接收。
Eventually, after nearly six hours of negotiation and communication, the 179 yuan in freight was borne by the donor and received by the Red Cross Society of Massachusetts.
在签收时，又出现了小插曲，红十字会发出的捐赠函中，原本的2000个口罩被写成了“20000只。
Another incident occurred when the Red Cross sent out a donation of 2,000 face masks that had been written as "20,000.
”事后张主任在接受采访时表示，是“入库的工作人员失误写错，已经纠正。
Director Zhang later said in an interview that it was "a mistake on the part of the staff who entered the warehouse and it has been corrected."
”在“拒收”事件中，何晓丽提到，最开始捐赠方希望直接捐赠至求助医院麻城市人民医院，但是院方表示需要由红十字会调配，于是，接收地址临时改为了麻城市红十字会。
In the "no take" incident, Ho mentioned that donors initially wanted to donate directly to the hospital, the Massachusetts People's Hospital, but the hospital said it needed to be deployed by the Red Cross, so the address was temporarily changed to the Red Cross.
张仁波表示，所有捐赠至麻城市的物资，不论是定向捐赠还是普通捐赠，都需要统一寄送到麻城市红十字会统一调配。
Zhang said all donations to Massachusetts, whether for targeted donations or general donations, would need to be sent to the Red Cross in a unified manner.
并且此次疫情获得物资自己无权调配。
And the outbreak of the acquisition of supplies themselves do not have the right to deploy.
麻城市建立了防疫防控指挥部，物资由副指挥长签字审批，并由麻城市物资保障组副组长签字，红十字会工作人员通知相应单位，并发放“取库单”，一般头天到达的物资，第二天会发放，紧急物资会尽快发放。
The materials shall be signed by the deputy director of the Massachusetts General Command, the staff of the Red Cross Society shall notify the corresponding units and issue a "withdrawal list." Materials arriving on the first day will generally be distributed the next day, and emergency supplies will be released as soon as possible.
对于定向捐赠的物资，原则上最大程度遵循捐赠者意愿，如果出现剩余，剩余物资将分配到其他医院。
In principle, for targeted donations, the will of the donor is followed to the maximum extent possible, and the surplus, if any, is distributed to other hospitals.
晚7点30分，何晓丽终于收到了麻城市人民医院的消息，物资已经全部到达医院。
At 7: 30 pm, He Xiaoli finally received the news from the People's Hospital in Massachusetts, supplies have all arrived at the hospital.
今天上午麻城市民政局回复称：事件中麻城市红十字会的两位直接经手人已经被撤职查办，麻城市纪委也介入调查，防疫指挥部在下午召开专题会议进行整改。
The Massachusetts Institute of Civil Affairs replied this morning that the two direct handlers of the Red Cross had been removed from their posts, that the Massachusetts Institute of Discipline had been involved in the investigation, and that the epidemic prevention command had held a special meeting in the afternoon to rectify the situation.
