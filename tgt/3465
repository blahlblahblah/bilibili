靠延缓策略，把疫情拖到夏天，缓解医院床位轮转的压力，进而在这一过程中控制疫情，面对激增的传染数字，真正要实施这一策略将非常困难文|《财经》记者 孙爱民 编辑|王小让4000万英国人接触新冠病毒，以便达到60%的人群感染，在全国形成群体免疫效果。
Keeping the epidemic under control in the process by slowing the epidemic into the summer and relieving the pressure of hospital bed rotations will make it very difficult to implement the strategy in the face of surging infection figures. Wang exposed 40 million Britons to the new Crown virus in order to reach 60 per cent of the population, creating a mass immunization effect nationwide.
近日，英国政府首席科学顾问帕特里克·瓦伦斯（Patrick Vallance）发表上述言论，一时舆论哗然。
Patrick Vallance, chief science adviser to the British government, raised eyebrows when he made the remark recently.
此前，英国首相鲍里斯·约翰逊（Boris Johnson）公开表示，新冠肺炎疫情将会使更多英国人失去所爱之人。
Earlier, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said publicly that the outbreak of pneumonia would cause more Britons to lose their loved ones.
英国部分人士主张的“群体免疫”法，是为了控制新冠病毒在未来冬天再发生时带来的影响。
Some in the UK advocate "mass immunization" to control the effects of the new cap virus in the coming winter.
按照帕特里克的说法：新冠病毒很有可能会像季节性流感那样，每年都会发生；长远来看，形成群体免疫才能有效控制。
According to Patrick, the new crown virus is likely to occur every year, as seasonal flu does; in the long run, the formation of mass immunization can be effectively controlled.
群体免疫是指在疾病流行过程中逐步形成的免疫力，当群体免疫力提高时，病毒的传播力也就会相应下降。
Group immunization refers to the disease in the course of the gradual formation of immunity, when the group immunity increases, the transmission of the virus will decline accordingly.
然而，用数千万民众试险，甚至可能造成数十万死亡的冒险做法，在英国遭到来自多方的反对。
Tens of millions of people, however, have faced opposition from many quarters in the UK, even risking hundreds of thousands of deaths.
英国前卫生大臣杰里米·亨特（Jeremy Hunt）称，“这是英国的紧急状态，但我很吃惊，政府明明知道，我们距离意大利仅相差4周，却依旧没有任何作为，动作过于缓慢。
Jeremy Hunt, a former British health minister, said: "This is a state of emergency in Britain, but I am surprised that the government knows that we are only four weeks away from Italy, and are still doing nothing and moving too slowly."
”国际权威医学期刊《柳叶刀》的主编理查德·霍顿（Richard Horton）评论称，英国政府的决策并不是依据科学做出的，而是在拿公众的安危玩“轮盘赌注”，是个重大的错误。
Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of The Lancet, an international medical journal, commented that the British government's decision-making was not based on science, but was a big mistake in playing "roulette bets" on the public's well-being.
“英国选择的是一种缓疫策略，目的是为推迟和压低流行高峰，但代价是会延长疫情流行时间。
"The UK has opted for a containment strategy to delay and lower the epidemic's peak, but at the cost of prolonging the epidemic."
”一名中国疾控中心研究员接受《财经》记者采访时分析，能否达到预期的目标，还不确定。
In an interview with CDC reporter Caijing, a researcher at the China CDC said it was uncertain whether the target would be met.
这一延缓策略，意图把疫情拖到夏天，气温上升，到那时，医院床位不会那么紧张，疫情也能得到控制。
The delay is intended to drag the epidemic into summer, when hospital beds will be less strained and the epidemic under control.
可在北京大学美年公众健康研究院教授宁毅看来，英国现在公布的是一种视死如归的策略，总人口6700万的英国，按照60%来感染，最终4000万人被感染来建立免疫屏障，结局很可能至少4000甚至上万人死亡，医疗资源不会因此保留，反而会耗尽，“相信英国的策略未来几天便会有大的调整”。
But, according to Ning Yi, a professor at Peking University's Graduate School of Public Health, the UK's 67 million people are infected at 60%, 40 million are infected, and the outcome is likely to be at least 4,000 or even tens of thousands dead.
他对《财经》记者说。
he told Caijing.
不同国家的防疫策略，基于各自体制、文化特点、社会和经济承受力，英国的缓疫策略究竟如何，还需观察。
It remains to be seen what the UK's response to the epidemic will be, given the institutional, cultural, social, and economic resilience of each country.
抗疫四个阶段，前三个都不现实3月12日，帕特里克·瓦伦斯以英国政府首席科学顾问身份，站在首相一侧，在新闻发布会上向媒体为英国的抗疫政策辩护。
Four phases of the epidemic, none of the first three were realistic March 12, when Patrick Vallance, the British government's chief scientific adviser, sided with the prime minister at a press conference to defend Britain's anti-epidemic policy.
帕特里克预测，新冠疫情在英国的高峰期将会持续10个到14个星期，在这期间，老年人将会得到重点保护。
Patrick predicts the peak of the new crown in Britain will last between 10 and 14 weeks, during which time older people will be protected.
50%的人群会在高峰期的3到4周内感染，95%的人群将会在9到10周感染病毒。
Fifty percent become infected within three to four weeks of the peak, and 95 percent become infected within nine to ten weeks.
而他的老同事宁毅，在3月13日主持的一次学术研讨会上，评论了英国应对新冠疫情的四个步骤，即阻击（containment），延缓（delay），疫苗医药（research），强力干预（mitigate），最终，寄希望自然感染以获得群体免疫的策略。
And his old colleague Ning Yi, at a colloquium on March 13, commented on the UK's four steps to dealing with the new crown, namely containment, delay, vaccine medicine, strong intervention, and, ultimately, the strategy of hoping for natural infections to immunize the population.
帕特里克曾于2012年到2018年间，担任跨国药企葛兰素史克（GSK）的研发总裁，宁毅曾经在此间与他共事过。
Mr. Patrick was president of research and development at GSK, a multinational pharmaceutical company, from 2012 to 2018, where he worked.
3月12日，英国首相鲍里斯·约翰逊在发布会上宣布：政府在应对新冠疫情方面，已经进入第二阶段，即从“试图控制病毒”到“延缓扩散”。
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced at a news conference on March 12 that the government had moved into a second phase of its response to the new crown, from trying to control the virus to slowing the spread of the disease.
在第二阶段，持续咳嗽、发烧患者，将实行居家自我隔离7天，期间无需对轻症患者进行医学检测；学校取消境外旅行计划。
In the second phase, patients with persistent cough and fever will be placed in self-imposed isolation for seven days, during which no medical check-ups will be required for patients with mild illness, and schools will cancel their overseas travel plans.
但是，英国并没有像欧洲其他国家那样，大面积学校停课、工厂停工，也未宣布限制大规模的民众集会、聚会活动。
But Britain has not, as the rest of Europe has done, closed its schools and factories, or announced restrictions on mass gatherings and gatherings.
帕特里克在此后的发言中解释，下一阶段，才将是禁止大型集会与大范围的家庭隔离。
In his subsequent statement, Patrick explained that the next stage would be to ban large gatherings from the wider family.
“新冠病毒的大部分传播，发生于小规模聚会中，而非大规模集会”。
"Most of the spread of the new crown virus occurs at small gatherings rather than at mass gatherings."
宁毅认为，英国政府四步走的策略不现实，在第一阶段，并没有强有力的遏制措施，就达不到第二阶段的延缓的目标，疫苗短期内更不现实，可能的药物不会有神奇的效果，所以应该是很快就会进入第四阶段——强力干预。
Ningyi believes that the British government's four-step strategy is unrealistic. In the first phase, without strong containment, the second phase of the delay will not be achieved, the vaccine will not be realistic in the short term, and the potential drugs will have no miraculous effect.
“意大利和韩国从‘佛系’防疫开始，现在不得不应急强力干预。
"Italy and South Korea started with Buddhism and now have to intervene forcefully.
”据英国国家医疗服务体系（NHS）的信息，截至3月13日，英国确诊病例已经达到798，其中有11名患者死亡。
As of March 13, there had been 798 confirmed cases in the UK, with 11 deaths, according to the NHS.
在宁毅看来，英国的新冠肺炎病例已经到了快速增加的阶段，“已经跳出一般的家庭或者是小范围的感染，到了社区传播的阶段，现在确诊人数3到5天翻倍，可见疫情正在快速往前发展”。
In Ningyi's view, Britain's new crown pneumonia cases have reached a stage of rapid increase, "has jumped out of the ordinary family or small-scale infection, to the stage of community transmission, now confirmed that the number of people doubled in three to five days, showing that the epidemic is advancing rapidly."
与避免群众大型集会的法国、意大利等其他欧洲国家采取了不同路数，英国政府不得不面对质疑。
The British government has had to take a different route from other European countries, such as France and Italy, which avoided mass rallies.
此前接受BBC采访时，帕特里克表示，我们的目标是减少峰值、延缓峰值到来，并不是完全强行压制住疫情。
In an earlier interview with the BBC, Patrick said our goal was to reduce peaks and delay their onset, not to suppress them entirely.
为此，基于大多数感染患者呈现轻症，需要让更多的人感染病毒以形成群体免疫。
For this reason, based on the mild nature of most infections, more people need to be infected with the virus to form mass immunization.
“如果你非常严厉地压抑某样东西，一旦有所放松，它就会反弹，而且是在错误的时间反弹”。
"If you suppress something very harshly, once relaxed, it rebounds, and at the wrong time."
帕特里克担心，如果眼下没有足够多的人感染新冠病毒，未来冬季新冠病毒卷土重来之时，医疗体系将会不堪负荷。
Patrick worried that if not enough people were infected with the new crown virus, the system would be overstretched by the time the virus returned in the coming winter.
视死如归的策略？激增的感染病例数字，让英国将疫情拖到夏天、医院床位不紧张时，来控制疫情的策略难度大增。
The number of cases has made it more difficult for the UK to control the outbreak when it is running out of hospital beds over the summer.
更何况，预测都是基于一定的假设前提，帕特里克对英国新冠疫情的预测，其假设前提是否合情合理？帕特里克此前在接受媒体采访时，多次提到新冠肺炎在大多数病人身上是轻症，死亡率只有1%，或者更低。
What's more, the predictions are based on the assumption that Patrick's prediction of a new crown condition in Britain is reasonable, Patrick told reporters several times earlier that pneumonia is mild in most patients, with a death rate of only 1 per cent or less.
致死率低，这也是英政府考虑让60%的人去接触病毒的原因之一。
The low death rate is one reason why the government is considering exposing 60 per cent of the population to the virus.
“这个假设明显是错误的。
"This assumption is clearly wrong.
目前中国还有这么多确诊病例没有出院的情况下，病死率就已经在3%左右了，远超1%，未来还会高一些，是流感病死率的几十倍。
With so many confirmed cases remaining undischarged, the fatality rate in China is already about 3 percent, well over 1 percent, and it is still a few dozen times higher than the death rate from influenza.
”宁毅说。
"said Ning Yi.
据中国国家卫健委的数据，目前新冠肺炎在中国的病死率是3.94%。
The death rate from pneumonia is 3.94 percent in China, according to the National Institutes of Health.
从2月13日到3月13日，新冠肺炎在中国的病死率每一天都在增长，从2.16%升至3.94%。
Between February 13 and March 13, the death rate from pneumonia in China rose daily, from 2.16 percent to 3.94 percent.
此外，普通人接触多少量的病毒是安全的？科学界还没有定论，现在不知道新冠病毒的阈值：接触多少病毒不发病也不清楚。
In addition, how much virus the average person is exposed to is safe? There is no scientific consensus, and the threshold for the new crown virus is not known: how much exposure to the virus does not occur is unclear.
只有在不发病的病毒量底线之下，才会产生类似打疫苗的效果，形成持久的免疫力。
Only under the threshold of a non-diseased virus can a vaccine-like effect be produced, creating a lasting immunity.
不仅如此，人群中形成群体免疫力，对病毒的危害形成一道屏障，但一旦病毒变异较大，这道屏障就需要重新加固。
Moreover, the formation of group immunity in the population acts as a barrier to virus damage, but once the virus mutates significantly, the barrier needs to be re-enforced.
虽然全球多个研究团队，分别对数十条、上百条新冠病毒全基因组序列进行比对，目前尚未发现新冠病毒较大的变异，但这并不意味着未来几个月，以至2020年冬季时，新冠病毒仍然保持稳定状态。
Although several research teams around the world have compared dozens and hundreds of new crown virus genome sequences, no significant variation of the new crown virus has been identified, but this does not mean that the new crown virus will remain stable in the coming months, until the winter of 2020.
此前有研究表明，SARS病毒在疫情的两个月后，变异速度开始加快。
Previous studies have shown that two months after the outbreak, the mutation rate began to accelerate.
“即便是流感，每年都会发生一些的变异，疫苗的研发与群体注射，是跟不上病毒的变异速度的。
"Even with flu, some variation occurs every year, and vaccine development and mass injections cannot keep pace with the virus's mutation rate.
”宁毅说，这是一个全新的病毒，防疫策略应该保守一点，“病死率高，医疗资源很容易崩溃；而且新冠肺炎病程比较长，恐怕等不到夏天到来，大批病人拥挤到ICU后，连病房都没有了。
'It's a whole new virus, and the prevention strategy should be conservative, 'says Ning.' There's a high mortality rate and it's easy to break down, 'he says.
”在宁毅的印象中，曾在葛兰素史克任研发总裁时的帕特里克，是一个很好的管理者，但是对数据不大敏感，不是传染病方面的专家，“对他这个决策有些失望，不太实际，也许他的专家组做过非常精准地预测。
In Ningyi's impression, Patrick, who was president of GlaxoSmithKline as president of R & D, was a good manager but was not very data-sensitive and not an expert on infectious diseases.
目前看，这样难度非常高”。
At the moment, it's very difficult.
鲍里斯·约翰逊任首相以来，一直给外界强力的印象。
Boris Johnson has given the outside world a strong impression since he became Prime Minister.
“这是个视死如归的策略。
"It's a dead-end strategy.
死亡到一定程度，自然形成免疫。
When death reaches a certain point, immunity forms naturally.
可40万人发病，哪个国家都受不了。
But 400,000 people are sick, and no country can stand it.
目前的策略是行不通的。
The current strategy does not work.
”宁毅认为，英国接下来可能会趁着节日，顺道实施停课，“快的话，几天内就会调整策略，最迟也超不过两周，就会进入第四阶段，进行强力干预”。
Ningyi said Britain might take advantage of the holiday to suspend classes next, "quickly, within a few days, and within two weeks at the latest, enter the fourth phase and intervene forcefully."
群体防疫代价：会延长流行时间病毒专家、哈佛大学教授Marc Lipsitch，在三月初预测，新冠病毒极有可能造成全球40%到70%的人口感染，“人们还没知晓自己感染时，就已经在传播病毒了”。
The cost of mass immunization: Harvard University professor Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist who prolongs the epidemic, predicted in early March that the new strain would most likely infect 40 to 70 percent of the world's population. "People are already spreading the virus before they know it.
Marc Lipsitch结合了多个常用的追踪与预测流行病的数学模型，得出上述结论。
Marc Lipsitch came to this conclusion by combining several commonly used mathematical models for tracking and predicting epidemics.
他建议，政府部门严格限制公众的集会，但他认为这很难做到，因为“集会包含了教会活动等”。
He suggested that government departments severely restrict public gatherings, but said they were difficult to do because "gatherings include church activities, etc."
一名深度参与国内疫情防控的中国疾控中心专家告诉《财经》记者，就目前新冠病毒呈现出来的面目看，它变成与人类长期共存之前，会使相当高比例的人类感染，呈现隐性感染或发病，这一比例将高达50%到70%。
An expert from the China CDC, which is deeply involved in domestic disease control, told Caijing that, given its current appearance, the new crown virus could cause a significant proportion of human infections, recessive infections or diseases, to be as high as 50 to 70 per cent before it coexists with humans.
在这位专家看来，在新冠病毒与人类共存之前，中间这一感染过程不加以有力地压制，其他地方还会出现像武汉1月中下旬的情形：病人激增，短时间内造成医疗系统严重过载。
In the expert's view, unless the intermediate infection process is forcefully suppressed before the new crown virus coexists with humans, something like the one that occurred in Wuhan in mid-to-late January: patients proliferate, causing severe strain on the health-care system in a short time.
不同国家基于各自体制、文化特点、社会和经济承受力，选择采取了不同策略。
Different countries have chosen to adopt different strategies based on their institutions, cultural characteristics, social and economic resilience.
中国从2020年1月以来，采取的是“遏止”或“围堵”的策略，在境内阻断疾病的传播。
Since January 2020, China has adopted a strategy of "containment" or "containment" to stop the spread of disease in China.
“这一策略取得了相应的效果，但难以长期维持。
"This strategy has worked, but it is not sustainable in the long run.
如果采取中国式措施，就要考虑一直坚守，直至人口中有高比例的人都打上了疫苗。
If Chinese-style measures are adopted, one should consider staying the course until a high proportion of the population is vaccinated.
”上述中国疾控中心专家分析。
The CDC expert analysis.
一些欧洲国家的缓疫策略做法，是想推迟和压低流行高峰，即让病例增长速度慢一点、幅度低一些，尽量不要使医疗系统过载。
The strategy of some European countries to contain the epidemic is to delay and lower the epidemic's peak, that is, to slow and lower the rate of case growth and to minimize the strain on the health system.
在这种情况下，使人群中相当的比例通过感染获得免疫，以使疫情得到缓解，但代价是延长了疫情的流行时间。
In such cases, a significant proportion of the population is immunized through infection in order to alleviate the epidemic, but at the cost of prolonging the epidemic's duration.
在中国之外，多数国家采取的是缓疫策略。
Outside China, most countries have adopted containment strategies.
即便目前，韩国、意大利、西班牙等正在实行强力措施的国家，他们在最初也是“预防性的等待”。
Even now, countries such as South Korea, Italy, and Spain, which are imposing tough measures, are initially "waiting preventively."
而在确诊人数暴增后，这些国家也并未实行严格意义上“中国式的围堵策略”——致力于将传染源完全消灭、将病例归零，而是提升缓疫措施的力度。
And, in the wake of the surge in diagnoses, these countries have not pursued a strictly "Chinese-style containment strategy" - aimed at eliminating the source of infection entirely and bringing cases to zero, but at scaling up containment efforts.
“现在还很难判断哪个策略是最优的。
"It's hard to tell which strategy is the best.
”上述中国疾控中心专家告诉《财经》记者，目前还没有明显的证据表明英国对疾病特征的认识有什么技术误判，至少他们知道新冠病毒比2009年的甲流更厉害；即便其他国家选择的缓疫策略，在具体措施、实施范围、时机和力度上也会各有差别，效果也会不同，“他们的策略措施能否达到他们预期的目标，存在不确定性”。
Experts at the CDC told Caijing that there was no clear evidence of a technical error in the UK's perception of disease characteristics, at least they knew that the new crown virus was worse than the 2009 swine flu; even if other countries opted for a pandemic strategy with different measures, scope, timing and intensity, "there is uncertainty about whether their tactics will achieve their intended goals."
