是为抗疫日记系列之二，来自武汉支援医护车队的一名滴滴司机刘邱斌。
Is for the anti-epidemic diary series 2, from Wuhan supporting a medical convoy drip driver Liu Qiubin.
内容由刘邱斌口述，深网整理编辑。
The content is dictated by Liu Qiubin and edited by deep net.
1月24日，除夕我是武汉黄陂的，之前一直在武汉这边做服装生意，直到去年有段时间服装生意不景气，就开始跑滴滴，跑了三个月，没想到赶上疫情爆发。
January 24, I was Wuhan Huangpi, before doing clothing business in Wuhan, until last year when the clothing business depression, began to run dribs and drips, did not expect to catch the outbreak of the outbreak.
上午，我们车队队长在微信群里发了一条通知，说是为了协助疫情防控工作，要应征一些滴滴司机组建“医护保障车队”，负责在武汉运送物资和接送医务人员。
In the morning, our team leader issued a notice in the message group, saying that in order to assist in the prevention and control of the epidemic, some drip drivers should form "medical support convoys" to transport goods and medical personnel in Wuhan.
我本来已经打算回家过年了，看到这个消息也没想太多，立马就报名了。
I had planned to go home for the New Year. I didn't think much about it, so I signed up right away.
我们那个车队有30多个司机，当时还有另外四个司机也报了名，我们算是保障车队第一批。
Our motorcade had more than 30 drivers, and four other drivers were also named. We were one of the first to guarantee the convoy.
下午，按照通知要求我到了车队的武昌站点领取物资，包括防护服、医用口罩、消毒液之类，工作人员给我们做了基本的防护培训，比如防护服要怎么穿，拉链必须拉到位，戴口罩和摘口罩的正确方式，用后怎么处理口罩和防护服。
In the afternoon, I was asked to go to Wuchang Station of the convoy to collect supplies, including protective clothing, medical masks, disinfectant and so on. The staff provided us with basic protective training, such as how to wear protective clothing, zippers must be pulled in place, the correct way to wear masks and masks, and how to handle masks and protective clothing after use.
工作人员还特意叮嘱我们，要勤洗手、常通风，每天要给车辆做多次消毒。
The staff also specifically instructed us to wash hands frequently, ventilation, to disinfect the vehicle many times a day.
我们这批大概有100人，分布在武汉不同的站点，我在的武昌站点有20多人。
Our group of about 100 people, distributed in Wuhan different sites, I have more than 20 people in Wuchang Station.
我姑姑他们一家子也在武汉，吃年夜饭的时候他们喊我过去，开始我没去。
My aunt and her family were in Wuhan, too. They called me over for dinner on New Year's Eve.
那时候还没有确切的任务下来，我就在家一直盯着手机等群里发通知。
At that time, there was no specific task down, I have been staring at the mobile phone and other groups to send notices.
后来一直没什么动静，我就去姑姑家吃了个饭，晚上回家接着等消息。
Nothing happened, so I went to my aunt's for a meal and went home at night to wait for news.
凌晨2点，任务来了，是第二天需要我们去接送的医护人员名单信息。
Two in the morning, the mission is coming, is the next day we need to pick up the list of medical personnel information.
因为第二天要早起，群里有些人已经睡了，我抢到了第一个任务单，是去接一个协和医院的护理人员。
Since some of the people in the group had gone to bed the next day, I got the first assignment order to pick up a paramedic at Concorde Hospital.
我告诉自己要赶紧睡觉，明天必须保证精力充沛。
I told myself I had to get some sleep and be energetic tomorrow.
1月25日，大年初一早上不到六点我就起了，按照昨晚发的位置信息，我去百步亭那边接到了这个医护人员，他是协和医院放射科的。
January 25, the first day of New Year's Day before six o'clock I got up, according to last night's location information, I went to the hundred steps to receive this medical personnel, he is Concorde Hospital radiology department.
因为是第一单，我甚至还有点激动。
Because it's number one, I'm even a little excited.
这次疫情关系到整个武汉甚至全国，很多医护人员都奋战在一线，需要有人来解决他们的出行问题。
The outbreak concerns the entire Wuhan and even the whole country, many medical personnel are fighting in the front line, need someone to solve their travel problems.
我妹妹在儿童医院工作，这段时间也一直在一线，所以我感受更深。
My sister works in a children's hospital, and this time has been on the front line, so I feel more deeply.
我觉得我应该出一份力。
I think I should do something about it.
我知道，现在医院里的情况一定忙到不行，情况危急必须重视起来。
I know, the situation in the hospital must be too busy now, the critical situation must be taken seriously.
这位医护人员特意叮嘱我，一定要做好防护。
The paramedic specifically told me to take precautions.
从早上开始，我们这一批司机的微信群消息就没停过。
Since the beginning of the morning, our group of drivers has not stopped the micro-message.
一条接一条的接送需求刚发到群里，马上就被司机们认领了。
One demand after another arrived in the group and was immediately claimed by the drivers.
这是场没有硝烟的“战争”，医护工作者是站在最前线的“战士”，他们在前面为我们挡风遮雨，那我们就为他们保障后勤。
It was a "war" without smoke, and the medical workers were the "warriors" on the front lines, shielding us from the elements and providing them with logistics.
关键时期、特殊时期，谁都不想掉链子，大家心里都绷着一根弦，准时完成任务。
Critical period, special period, who do not want to lose the chain, we all have a string in their hearts, on time to complete the task.
考虑到有司机可能会因为临时状况没法接送，当时还组织了一批“后备军”司机。
A group of "reservists" was also formed, considering that drivers might not be able to pick them up because of temporary conditions.
接触这些医护工作者，我能感觉到他们压力很大，很疲惫。
I can feel the stress and fatigue of the healthcare workers they come into contact with.
也有让我感动的时刻。
There were moments when I was touched.
凌晨一点，我去协和医院接一个大夫下班，他家人特别担心大半夜回不了家。
At 1 a.m., I went to the Concorde Hospital to pick up a doctor who was too worried to be home in the middle of the night.
因为这时候武汉市里的车子都不让走了，但是医护人员的出行需求是很大的。
Because at this time Wuhan city cars are not allowed to go, but the travel needs of medical staff is very large.
我领到任务的同时，这个大夫的家人也拿到了我的联系方式。
When I received my assignment, the doctor's family also got my contact information.
他妻子特意提前给我打了个电话，问我那么晚能不能接他老公回家，我说你放心，肯定能。
His wife called me ahead of time to ask me if I could pick up his husband at home so late.
她在电话那头感谢个不停。
She kept thanking at the other end of the phone.
右为司机刘邱斌1月26日，大年初二今天依旧是在微信群里领任务。
On the right is driver Liu Qiubin January 26, New Year's Day is still today in the micro-letter group lead mission.
任务发下来，哪个司机最先报名，就交给他去执行。
When the assignment is handed down, the driver who signs up first will be given the job.
经过一天半的接送，一些问题也随之而来。
After a day and a half of pick-up, some problems followed.
因为滴滴软件在武汉暂时停止了服务，我们只能靠微信群通过人工调度来承接任务，可问题就在于，有的司机家离接送医护人员的位置和医院距离很远，这样一来会白白耗费很多路上的时间。
Because drip software in Wuhan temporarily stopped service, we can only rely on micro-groups to take over the task manually, but the problem is that some drivers away from the location and the hospital, will waste a lot of time on the road.
下午的时候，滴滴给我们和医护人员专门上线了一个线上派单系统。
In the afternoon, the drip gave us and the paramedics a dedicated online delivery system.
这些医护人员只要通过手机认证就能直接下单，跟平时打车一样，我们通过软件来接单。
As long as the medical staff through the mobile phone certification can be ordered directly, as usual, we use software to receive orders.
这样根据定位，车辆调度就不再是问题，资源合理利用，也节约时间提高效率。
In this way, vehicle scheduling is no longer a problem, resources are used rationally and time is saved to improve efficiency.
更重要的是，之前只通过微信群，很多医护工作者都不知道我们车队的存在，现在一天下来，我能拉十多单。
More importantly, through the microphone community, many health care workers were unaware of the existence of our motorcade, and by the end of the day, I was able to play more than a dozen.
早上6点半到10点，是医院上下班交接的时间，这时候单也比较多；然后就是下午4点到10点多。
From 6: 30am to 10: 00am, it is the transfer time at the hospital, and there are more single hours, then between 4: 30pm and 10: 00pm.
收车回家之后，我们也都不闲着，群里的司机会讨论哪里单量大，哪里更需要我们，或者互相交换信息分配下离得近的单。
When we get home, we're not idle. Drivers in the group talk about where we need us more, where to order, or where to exchange information to distribute close to each other.
公司那边也会跟我们讲，要多在医院附近转一转，一开始我是负责协和医院的，线上接单开通之后，我们就主要去武汉中心医院、协和肿瘤医院、武汉三医院这些地方。
At first I was in charge of Concorde Hospital. After the order was opened, we went to Wuhan Central Hospital, Concorde Cancer Hospital and Wuhan Three Hospitals.
1月27日，大年初三今天，医护保障车队人数增加到200人，社区保障车队的1000名司机也在陆续到位。
Today, January 27, the number of medical support convoys increased to 200 people, the community protection fleet of 1,000 drivers are also in place.
看滴滴公布的消息，说我们车队现在接入了武汉协和、武汉市中心医院、武汉三院7个院区，有2000多名医务工作者的注册手机号被录入了系统。
We are now connected to Wuhan Concorde, Wuhan Central Hospital and Wuhan Three Colleges. More than 2,000 registered mobile phone numbers of medical workers have been entered into the system.
几天下来，吃饭成了难题，因为武汉封城，很多地方都关门了，我准备了很多泡面在车上吃，有时候其他师傅看到有卖吃的的就帮我顺道捎过来。
Over the next few days, eating became a problem, because Wuhan closed the city, many places are closed, I prepared a lot of noodles in the car to eat, sometimes other teachers saw the food to help me to pick up.
除了吃饭、睡觉，这几天基本上都是在车上度过。
Except for eating and sleeping, I have spent most of these days in the car.
今天早上我又接到了一个协和医院的护士。
I got another nurse from Concorde Hospital this morning.
她一上车就给我递过来几个橘子，说是自家种的，还有一些别的吃的。
As soon as she got on the bus, she handed me some oranges, saying that she had grown them in her own house, and some others.
她知道现在外面吃饭很困难，我一下子就被暖到了。
She knew it was difficult to eat out now, and I was quickly warmed up.
真的，特别温暖，越是这种时期越能感受到人性的善。
Really, especially warm, the more such a period of time can feel the goodness of human nature.
我们穿的防护服都是一次性的，脱了就不能用。
The protective clothing we wear is disposable and cannot be used if taken off.
因为是连体防护服，上厕所有点不方便。
It's a little inconvenient to go to the bathroom because it's a combination suit.
路边的洗手间还开放，我们有时候就得憋着，或者通过手机地图找。
Roadside bathrooms are still open, and we sometimes have to hold back or look for them on a mobile map.
1月28日，大年初四今天遇到一个事情让我特别感动。
On January 28th, I was particularly moved by an event that happened today on Thursday.
下午我接了个单，送一个医生去中心医院，这家医院是专门接收重症病患的。
In the afternoon I picked up a list and took a doctor to the central hospital, which was dedicated to patients with severe illnesses.
离医院还有一段距离的时候，这个医生就让我靠边停车，我问他怎么了，他说现在疫情严重，担心我被传染，说这段路他自己走过去就行。
Some distance from the hospital, the doctor asked me to pull over and I asked him what was wrong. He said the outbreak was serious and he was afraid that I would be infected.
手机新闻推送的那些消息让我意识到疫情的严重性，看着每天增加的确诊人数很揪心。
The news from the mobile news made me aware of the severity of the epidemic, and it was heartbreaking to see the daily increase in the number of confirmed cases.
一开始我心里也不太有底，慢慢接触到这些接送的医护人员之后，也深知必须要做好防护，提高免疫力。
At the beginning of my heart is not very bottomless, slowly contact with these transport medical personnel, but also well aware of the need to do a good job of protection, improve immunity.
武汉是这场疫情的起发点，医护人员奋战在一线，我们武汉市民也得全力配合。
Wuhan is the starting point of this epidemic, the medical staff fighting in the front line, we Wuhan city people have to cooperate fully.
说实话，中国人在面对灾难面前表现的积极、勇敢、团结真的令人感动。
To tell the truth, the Chinese people in the face of disaster in the face of positive, courageous, solidarity is really moving.
至于家里人，一开始他们觉得我干这件事很危险，不太理解，后来看见我每天跟他们分享做了什么事之后，他们很支持我。
As for my family, at first they thought I was dangerous and incomprehensible, but when they saw me sharing what I did with them every day, they were very supportive.
我是外公外婆带大的，他们80多岁了，和我舅舅住在一起，我很想他们，等忙完了这段我第一件事就是回去看他们。
I was raised by my grandparents, they are over 80 years old, I live with my uncle, I miss them, and the first thing I do is go back to see them.
作者手记：第一次联系刘邱斌的时候，他正在接送医护人员的路上，我跟他说方便的时候我给他打过去。
Author's Note: When I first contacted Liu Qiubin, he was on his way to pick up the paramedics. I called him when it was convenient.
中午1点终于等到了他的消息。
At last he got his message at 1 o'clock.
电话那头，叫车软件的播报声时不时响起，远在北京的我突然觉得一切离我很近。
At the other end of the line, the announcement of car-calling software rang from time to time, and all of a sudden I felt close to me in Beijing.
特殊时期，我们都宅在家里避免不必要的外出，嘱咐亲人朋友做好防护。
During special periods, we all stay at home to avoid unnecessary travel, and instruct friends and relatives to do a good job of protection.
身在前线，我问刘邱斌怕不怕被感染，他说不怕；我后来又问了他一遍，他说真没想那么多，作为武汉人，他觉得自己必须得做点什么。
Being on the front line, I asked Liu Qiubin if he was afraid of being infected. He said he was not afraid of being infected.
这个问题抛给刘邱斌的同时，我也在问自己，我俩年纪一样大，换作是我，我会不会毅然前往？中午聊天结束，我才知道他还没吃午饭。
This question to Liu Qiubin, I also asked myself, we are the same age, I would not resolutely go, if it is me? At the end of the chat at noon, I knew he had not eaten lunch.
下午我把整理好的内容发给他确认，想再约他聊聊，直到晚上他才回复，说感谢我们记录他的故事。
In the afternoon, I sent him the notes for confirmation, and wanted to ask him out to talk again until evening, when he replied that he was grateful to us for recording his story.
晚上9点多，刘邱斌正在给车子充电，他说想等等看还有没有预约单。
More than 9 pm, Liu Qiubin is charging the car, he said he would like to wait to see if there is an appointment.
所有聊天都是在他工作间隙进行的，我甚至觉得每一通电话、每一条微信都是对他的打扰，但同时我也相信这些记录有必要并且有价值。
All the chats took place between his work hours, and I even felt that every phone call, every micro-letter was a nuisance to him, but at the same time I believed that the records were necessary and valuable.
刘邱斌只是一个小的缩影，很多人都在默默付出，医护工作人员在最前方为我们遮风挡雨，司机、外卖员、快递员这些出行、餐饮、物流领域普通角色则在努力保障他们的后勤。
Liu Qiubin is just a small miniature, many people are quietly paying, medical staff in the front for us to shelter from the wind and rain, the driver, takeaway, express delivery these travel, catering, logistics these ordinary players are trying to ensure their logistics.
疫情面前，谁能置身事外？我们也都在能力范围内做自己该做的事。
Who can stay out of the epidemic? We all do what we have to do within our capabilities.
