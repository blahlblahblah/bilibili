2月，三明治发起“中国素描”， 希望大家用最质朴动人的笔调，把这个时刻的中国各地记录下来。
In February, Sandwiches launched a "Chinese Sketch," hoping that everyone would record the moment in the most rustic and touching tones of all over China.
目前已经开始记录的城市有宁波、百色、咸阳、上海、香港、汕头、济南、烟台、南京、苏州、重庆、恩施……这个特别的时刻，在中国的千万个城市和乡村，生活的面貌如何在一夜之间被改变，如果我们能留下一点记录，就是为了不遗忘，不能忘。
Ningbo, Baise, Xianyang, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Shantou, Jinan, Yantai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Chongqing, Enshi... are now beginning to be recorded.
高楼上的观察者记录者：Chenchu坐标：浙江 宁波开始工作以后，我搬到了市中心繁华地段一栋古旧公寓楼的顶楼。
Viewer on the second floor: Chenchu coordinates: After Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, started work, I moved to the top of an old apartment building in a busy downtown area.
该怎么形容我住的地方呢？下楼就是地铁一号线和二号线的交汇处，如果从房间望出去，左手边是鼓楼，右手边是天一广场，身后是城隍庙，面前是市政府旧址，区政府现址。
Below is the confluence of Subway Line 1 and Line 2. If viewed from the room, the Drum Tower is on the left side, Tianyi Square on the right side and the Temple on the rear.
就在这么一个黄金地段，我有了每天从26楼的窗户向外望，看楼下车流、看远方群山的习惯。
In such a prime location, I have the habit of looking out the window on the 26th floor every day, at the traffic downstairs, at the mountains far away.
从我房间看出去的宁波市中心。
The center of Ningbo from my room.
画面右下角是老市政府的办公楼，左上角是宁波市第二医院，肺炎的定点医院。
The lower right corner is the old city office building, the upper left corner is Ningbo City Hospital No. 2, pneumonia designated hospital.
宁波的疫情管控大概是从春节开始收紧的。
Ningbo outbreak control probably began to tighten from the Spring Festival.
私家车比往年春节都少，少到每个红绿灯，四岔路口排队的都只有两三辆车。
Private cars are fewer than the Spring Festival in previous years, less than each traffic light, four fork in the road queuing only two or three cars.
一开始，马路上还有很多公交在按时跑。
At first, there were many buses running on time on the road.
因为道路通畅，竟然觉得公交出现的频次比平时还要高。
Because the road is unobstructed, unexpectedly feels the frequency that the bus appears is higher than usual.
然后有一天，所有的地铁线路都停了，公交的发车间隔也拉长到了一小时一班。
Then one day, all the subway lines stopped, and the interval between bus journeys lengthened to one hour.
共享单车、市民自行车早已没什么人骑。
Sharing bicycles and citizen bicycles has long been neglected.
晚上九点后的马路，几乎是一片寂静了。
The road after nine in the evening was almost silent.
宁波天一广场，市中心繁华地段的老牌商业广场。
Ningbo Tianyi Square, the downtown bustling area of the old commercial plaza.
疫情防控最紧张的时候，中午时段都空无一人。
At the height of the epidemic, midday hours were empty.
药行街，在天一广场旁边，几乎没有车。
Medicine Hing Street, next to Tianyi Square, almost no cars.
路的尽头是将近百年历史的灵桥。
At the end of the road is a nearly hundred-year-old bridge.
没有了大量私家车和公交车的道路，剩下的就是零星的外卖小哥、出租车，和有时拉警报有时又不拉的救护车。
With no large number of private cars and buses left, there are sporadic takeaway brothers, taxis, and sometimes siren ambulances.
本来骑电瓶车就很洒脱的小哥们，入夜后干脆骑上了快车道，嗖一下就飞过路口奔向他们的目的地，令人担心他们的安全。
The young man, who used to be a free and easy rider, went into the fast lane at night, whizzed past the intersection and headed for their destination, worrying about their safety.
看到出租车开过，我就忍不住想，今天他们能拉到多少单呢？路上根本是看不到什么人啊。
Seeing the taxi pass, I couldn't help but wonder how many tickets they could pull today? There was no one on the road.
要是驶过的出租车没有亮着绿色的接客小灯，便会替他们开心一小下：可总算接到了客人！说到救护车，其实看到的次数是很多的。
If a passing taxi does not have a green light, it will make them happy for a while: but at last they have a visitor!
从楼下的四岔路口向前望，靠左手一点的位置就是宁波二院，是收治病人的一家定点医院。
From the four branches downstairs looking forward, depending on the position of the left hand is Ningbo II hospital, is a hospital for patients.
空旷街道上的救护车很好辨认，虽然它们好像很多时间都是静悄悄地开过，几乎是不动声色的，是载着中招了的病人，还是普通病人呢？高楼到地面的距离让我只能像观察一幅画一样观察这些不动声色的救护车。
Ambulances in the open streets are easy to identify, although they seem to pass quite quietly, almost silently, carrying admitted patients or ordinary patients? The distance from the building to the ground allows me to observe these silent ambulances like a picture.
二院和我居住的公寓楼之间，有一个很大的中山广场，从窗户望出去能清楚地看到。
Between the Second House and the apartment building I live in, there is a large Zhongshan Square, which can be clearly seen from the window.
小时候我就住在中山广场后面，现在那地方的周边已经是城区中一块待改造的历史文化保护街区。
When I was a child I lived behind Zhongshan Square, which is now surrounded by a historic and cultural preservation block in the city.
这两天常常会回忆起疫情开始前中山广场的样子。
These two days often recall what Zhongshan Square looked like before the outbreak began.
因为有一块巨大的空旷平地，又在市中心，很多周边居民平常都会骑着电动车，从下午到晚上在广场里跳交谊舞、迪斯科、霹雳舞之类挺有年代感的舞蹈。
Because of a large, empty flat, downtown area, many of the surrounding residents routinely ride electric cars, dating dances such as ballroom dancing, disco and break dancing in the square from afternoon to evening.
有一次刷豆瓣，还在视频的栏目里看到有人录下了中山广场霹雳舞“舞王”的舞姿。
One time brushed bean discs, also in the video column to see someone recorded Zhongshan Square break dance "dance king."
只是那时候的热闹有种突然被强力吸尘器吸走的感觉，片甲不留。
Only the excitement of that time was suddenly a strong vacuum cleaner to absorb the feeling, the film does not leave.
夜晚地上的景观灯倒是一盏盏照常亮起。
At night, however, the lights on the ground lit up as usual.
它们是这些舞者的替身吗？它们怎么不说话呢？第三例确诊病例是个粉店老板记录者：兔子雨坐标：广西 百色这里是广西西南边陲的小城百色，地理位置上临近东南亚，与越南接壤，地形以山区、丘陵为主，少有平原地带。
Are they stand-ins for the dancers? Why aren't they talking? The third confirmed case is a powder store owner's record holder: Rabbit Rain Coordinates: Guangxi Baise, a small city on Guangxi's southwest frontier, geographically close to Southeast Asia, bordering Vietnam, with mountainous terrain, hilly terrain and few plains.
摩托车、电动车是人们最钟爱的出行方式。
Motorcycles and electric cars are people's favorite way to travel.
边骑电动车边逛菜市，是人们的特有的习惯。
While riding electric cars around the vegetable market, is a unique habit of people.
随着百色市右江区人民政府颁布的防控新冠肺炎通告出台，百色城区的餐饮服务业、流动摊贩被全面禁止。
With the promulgation of the notice of prevention and control of New Crown Pneumonia issued by the right Jiangxi District People's Government, Baise City's catering services, mobile vendors were banned.
东风菜市难得一见宽敞的后巷东风菜市鱼摊附近这是百色城20多年来冷冻期最长的春节，不管是物理上还是心理上的。
Dongfeng vegetable market rare see spacious back alley Dongfeng vegetable market fish stalls This is Baise City for more than 20 years the longest frozen Spring Festival, whether physical or psychological.
由于第三例确诊病例是个粉店老板，全百色城的粉摊被全面关停，再难以见到那样的盛景：各色电动车和小汽车一波接一波堆积在粉店门口，一碗又一碗热腾腾的米粉打开了人们新一天的希冀。
As the third confirmed case is a powder shop owner, 100 color city powder stall was closed, no longer see such a spectacular: electric cars and cars piled up in waves in front of the powder shop, bowl after bowl of hot rice powder opened people's hopes for a new day.
而现在，紧闭的粉店卷帘门和背后唏嘘的老板，似道出了特殊时期小城的无奈。
But now, the closed powder shop curtain door and behind sob boss, like a special period of the town helpless.
一夜间，农村阿公阿婆新鲜挑担出来的小菜苗小瓜果没了、县份常驻城区菜场的商贩信息出货的土鸡土鸭土货没了、居住在水库附近打鱼人新鲜打捞的小河鱼小虾米螺蛳没了、大菜市旁祥庆巷手艺人新鲜蒸制的糯米肠卷筒粉也没了……东风菜市家禽土货商贩零星营业本土小吃集体下线，饮食大过天的小城人民开启了苦修般的生活。
During the night, the small fruits and vegetables fresh picked out by the rural mother-in-law, the county part of the city vegetable market information sent out of the mud and duck goods, fish fishing nearby the reservoir fresh salvage small shrimp barbecue snail disappeared, Dawei Xiangqing Lane craftsman fresh steamed glutinous rice noodle reel powder.
不能挑挑拣拣，对小菜货比三家，不能跟摊主讨价还价，唠唠家常。
Can not pick and choose, on the vegetables shop around, can not bargain with the vendor, nagging.
这对慢节奏、细生活的小城人民来说，简直失掉了买菜之乐趣、之精神！疫情的肆虐，在心理上，让买卖双方无暇顾及交易之外的生活，戴上口罩，亦更难解读到买卖双方之间的微妙表情，自少了一番博弈之趣味。
For the slow-paced, sophisticated people of the town, the fun and spirit of buying food has been lost! The ravages of the epidemic have psychologically distracted buyers and sellers from their lives outside the transaction, put on masks, and made it harder to decipher the subtle expressions of buyers and sellers and reduce the fun of the game.
人人形色匆匆，机械地去完成买菜的任务，还要忍受限购，忍受排队，忍受分配……想要过把嘴瘾，全靠自家手艺！一些机敏的个体经营者、养殖者、种植者，手艺人，纷纷抱团取暖，建立起五花八门的社交群组，借助短视频、vlog、微信接龙等形式，风风火火做起了线上营销。
In a hurry and mechanically complete the task of buying vegetables, we have to endure restrictions, queues, and assignments... Some smart self-employed, breeders, growers, craftspeople, get huddled together, set up a myriad of social groups and started online marketing via short videos, vlogs, micro-letters, etc.
本土小吃完成了状态的更新和流转，以一种新形态重又出现在小城人民视野中。
Local snacks have completed the status of renewal and circulation, with a new form of re-appear in the eyes of the people of the city.
每个人都在避免和任何人碰头记录者：三慢坐标：陕西 咸阳这座小城没有生活物资紧缺的急迫，超市管理严格。
Everybody is avoiding meeting anyone to record: three slow coordinates: Shaanxi Xianyang this small city is not in urgent need of supplies, supermarket management is strict.
坐电梯下行，偷偷摸摸咳嗽一声，还招致了对面上行电梯上的一双白眼，帽子下白发耀眼。
Take the elevator down, a sneak cough, but also caused the opposite elevator on a pair of white eyes, white hair under the hat dazzle.
眼神里的潜台词呼之欲出。
The subtext of the look came out.
超市里人不多，但全都在尽力避免和任何人碰头，独享一片有消毒水刺鼻味道的货架。
There were not many people in the supermarket, but they were all trying to avoid meeting anyone and enjoying a disinfectant-smelling shelf.
当然，没人来得及享受。
Of course, no one had time to enjoy it.
这并不是一个浪漫时刻，你很难捕捉到苦中作乐的念头。
It's not a romantic moment, and it's hard to capture the thought of having fun.
平时热闹的零食区，现在空空荡荡。
The popular snack area is now empty.
大脑里飘过的是：“盐和醋，调味区！卷纸和抽纸，对，靠近文具区！蔬菜水果最后买，现在，人肯定都在那片挤着……”极致理性计算着路线和时间，维护着形只影单的安全。
"Salt and vinegar, seasoning area! Roll and paper, yes, near the stationery area! Vegetable and fruit finally bought, now, people must be there..." Extreme rationality calculates the route and time, maintaining the security of the form alone.
但只要深入果蔬区，就躲不过左右夹击，非要逼着人人抢占先机，拿购物车先将一军。
But as long as you go deep into the fruit and vegetable area, you can not hide left and right clamp, must force everyone to seize the first opportunity, take shopping cart first army.
前方被挑选砂糖橘的老人抄了路，无奈静止在夹缝里，等待救援，身体机警，嘴巴紧闭。
In front of the old man selected sugar orange copied the road, helplessly in the crevice, waiting for rescue, the body alert, mouth closed.
脑子里的声音又出现了：“为什么没有带手套……怎么回事……这些人是附近的吗……好想咳嗽……不能……别人会害怕……”如果这只是一个人脑海里台词，声音也不会这么轰响。
The voice inside my head came back: "Why don't you wear gloves... What's going on... are these people nearby?... Coughing so much...... no......" If it was just a word in one's head, it wouldn't sound so loud.
相同的恐惧各悬空中。
The same fears hang in the air.
了解一本小说人物的状态，要看他说什么，也要观察他在做什么。
To understand the state of a fictional character, it is necessary to see what he says and what he is doing.
重新看那位老人，她已经以最快的速度挑拣完了手里的桔子，都是汁皮饱满的。
Looking back at the old man, she had picked out the oranges in her hand as quickly as she could. They were full of juice.
戴着口罩，她说不出的台词是什么？够掩饰脆弱吗？像“黄昏已近不怕夜沉”，“少时多困苦，今日无多惧”这样的台词，她出门前在镜前默念，现在却洪亮地朝我扑过来，抓住了我，消融不安。
Wearing a mask, what is her speechless line? Is it enough to cover up her frailty? Like the lines "Evening is near the end of the night," "Too little is too much to fear today," she murmured in front of the mirror before she went out.
而不经意间，已经从老人拿捏桔子的专心捕捉了一句密语进口袋，鼓励自己迈步。
And inadvertently, from the old man to take the concentration of oranges captured a secret word into the pocket, encourage their own step.
打好价签，老人推走了各色蔬果，不同品牌的米面油，直奔一盘盘的鸡蛋去了。
The price tag, the old man pushed away the various colors of fruits and vegetables, different brands of rice noodle oil, straight to a plate of eggs to go.
道路畅通，我与计价员互换眼神，番茄贴上价签。
The road was clear, I exchanged looks with the clerk, and the tomatoes were priced.
轻声说谢谢，他没听到，但伸手缩手间，也把“明天会更好”的密语递给了他。
Quietly said thank you, he did not hear, but stretched out his hand between the hands, also "tomorrow will be better" secret words to him.
年迈者时刻审视着命运，顿悟随时间层层叠起，层层轻薄密实，不可言与他人。
Old people always look at the fate of the layers of understanding with time, layer upon layer, thin and dense, not to speak of others.
而疫情非得拿刀子切开心事，验证这份大彻大悟的厚重，这座城市里的年迈者也未吝啬智慧。
And the epidemic must be carried out with a knife open mind, to verify that this thorough understanding of the thick, the city's elderly have not stingy wisdom.
在超市里奔忙，这是他们的抗疫前线，守护小城的甜咸如常。
In the supermarket to rush, this is their front line against the epidemic, guarding the city's sweet salty as usual.
这是属于小城的一个浪漫时刻，一大清早就让人有了苦中作乐的念头。
It was a romantic moment for the town, and early in the morning people had the idea of having a good time.
三明治·中国素描计划在“中国素描”计划中，我们为参与记录的写作者们设置了一些问题。
Sandwiches and Chinese Sketches In the "Sketch of China" project, we have a number of questions for the authors of the notes.

用50字描述这场疫情之前，你所生活的城市是怎么样的？记录者：兔子雨坐标：广西百色我所生活的城市是中国西南边陲的十八线小城市，随手一拍就颇具东南亚特色。
What was the city you lived in before the outbreak was described in 50 wordsLogger: Rabbit Rainfall Coordinates: Guangxi Baise The city I live in is a small, 18-line city on the southwestern border of China, which is quite Southeast Asian in a snap shot.
这里山区丘陵密布，靠近北回归线地带，大部分本地人精瘦、肤色又黑又黄。
The mountains are thick, close to the Tropic of Cancer, and most of the locals are lean, dark and yellow.
疫情发生这段时间，小城气温持续走低，人们穿上厚重的棉服，戴上雪白的口罩，由于确诊病例不多，人们看起来倒是心宽体胖，肤色沾了口罩的光，白了好几度。
The epidemic comes as the city continues to experience low temperatures, with people donning heavy cotton clothes and wearing snow-white masks, and with few confirmed cases, people appear to be overweight, with skin-mask-stained skin that has turned white for several degrees.
记录者：宋蕊坐标：湖北恩施作为一个旅游城市，喧嚣嘈杂昼夜不停是常态。
Record holder: Song Lian coordinates: Hubei Enshi as a tourist city, noise, noise, day and night is the norm.
除了永远人挤人的景区，白日里豆皮店合渣店路边小吃摊和土家餐馆是主力，待夜幕降临按摩店又亮起红红绿绿的招牌，街头巷尾永远都是生意人的战场。
In addition to the permanently crowded scenic spots, the main street-side snack bars and Tujia restaurants in the day-time Bean Shop are the main ones, and when night falls, massage parlours will always be a battleground for businessmen.
每次回家我们都会去吃豆皮过早，当天现做的豆皮爽滑劲道，青椒肉丝浇头带着刚出锅的镬气，加一点辣油就是完美的早餐，吃完出门遇到熟人再来一句。
Every time we go home, we eat the pea peel too early, the skin is smooth, green pepper sauce with just out of the wok, add a little spicy oil is the perfect breakfast, eat out of the door to meet acquaintances again.
记录者：鹤子坐标：苏州她很美，是现代与古典的结合体，充满活力又端庄典雅。

她的节奏很快，不论工作日或是周末，早晚高峰时，地铁总是挤出了大城市的水平。
She has such a fast pace that the subway always squeezes out of the big cities, whether it's on weekdays or weekends, in the morning and in the morning.
观前街和苏州中心这些商业区受到年轻人的青睐，饭店的门口每天都有衣着时尚的年轻人排队等候。
The shopping districts of Guanqianjie and Suzhou are popular with young people, who line up at the entrance to the hotel every day.
皮市街、葑门等老街区则是老年人的天地，苏州阿姨就算是与小贩砍价，吴音依旧软糯好听。
Marilyn and other old streets are old people's homes. Aunt Suzhou even if it's bargaining with vendors, Wu Yin is still soft and waxy.
这是个包容性很强的城市，常住人口达1000万以上。
It is an inclusive city with a resident population of more than 10 million.
疫情的恐慌来袭前，这座城市包括这里的人们都有条不紊的过着苏式生活。
Before the outbreak of panic, the people of the city, including here, were living a Soviet-style life in an orderly fashion.
记录者：李二妈坐标：香港香港是一个有着极强生命力与恢复能力的城市，人们这样说。
Record holder: Li Erma coordinates: Hong Kong Hong Kong is a city with great vitality and resilience, people said.
在经过之前六个月的动荡后，我相信了。
After six months of turmoil, I believe it.
在疫情的警报拉响前，香港已经在各种警报声与喧闹声中过了六个月有余。
Before the alarm went off, Hong Kong had spent more than six months in the midst of all the alarms and din.
有许多个周末的夜晚，在电视里看到硝烟四起、满城狼藉。
For many weekend nights, I saw on TV the smoke was everywhere and the city was in a mess.
而天又亮起来的时候，令人惊讶地，港铁扫完了满地的碎玻璃，又开始载着一车车西服革履的打工仔返工去了。
When it was light again, surprisingly, the grate cleared the ground and began to work again with truckloads of groceries.
你最近一次出门做了什么？记录者：王木木坐标：山东菏泽正月十一那天，老公带着我偷偷回了趟娘家，因为各个村进出的路都被封死，车无法进出。
What did you do the last time you went out? Record holder: Wang wooden coordinates: Shandong Heze on the eleventh day of the first month, my husband and I sneaked back to their home, because the villages are blocked access roads, cars can not access.
只能骑电动车从土路绕。
E-bike only from the dirt road.
小路弯弯曲曲，坑坑洼洼，一路上颠簸，差点把胃里的东西都颠出来。
The path was winding and bumpy and bumpy, almost shaking everything in my stomach.
原本开车5分钟的车程，因为绕绕绕去，我们走了将近半个小时。
It was a five-minute drive, and we walked around for almost half an hour.
记录者：大饼坐标：重庆6号，小区封闭管理前夜，我和我妹。
Record: Big cake coordinates: Chongqing 6, the cell closed management night, I and my sister.
“你想不想出去看看外面什么样？”我妹就一孩子，大过年的十天没上过街了，哪里晓得那些揪心的故事，痛苦的眼泪，只两放眼光的对我直点头。
"Would you like to go out and see what it is like outside?" My sister, a child, had not been out of the street in ten days of the Chinese New Year.
我们上了街，冷清。
We went out into the street.
流过小镇的那条河两岸挂满了金色的元宝灯，安静的倒影在河面，我们低着头循着灯影看去，一条小船独自靠在水岸，灯影像天上的星，温柔的抚着船，夜深。
The banks of the river that ran through the town were covered with golden silver lamps, and the quiet reflection was on the river. We looked down from the lamplight, and a small boat was leaning against the water bank alone.
这样的静谧美好，不知有几人看见。
It was so quiet and beautiful that a few people could see it.
