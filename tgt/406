作者 | 第一财经邵海鹏“现在不论是物流，还是私人罐车都不愿意跑湖北线路。
First Financial Secretary Shao Haipeng "Neither logistics nor private tankers are willing to take the Hubei route now.
”1月31日，大年初七，听到办公室人员传递来的信息，王东湖（化名）心里非常焦急。
On January 31, about the seventh day of the new year, Wang Donghu (not his real name) was very anxious when he heard the message from the office staff.
养殖行业一般都是准备饲料到初五，尽管公司备货到初八，但这两天也怕不够喂，所以已经对存栏的5000头种猪限食，一天原本吃三顿，现在改成吃一顿。
Breeding industry is generally prepared to feed to the fifth, although the company stock to the eighth, but the two days are afraid of not enough to feed, so has been limited to the stock column 5000 pigs, a day originally ate three meals, now eat a meal.
王东湖是湖北扬翔农牧科技有限公司工作人员，该公司位于湖北省襄阳市。
Wang Donghu is a staff member of Hubei Yangxiang Agricultural and Livestock Technology Co. Ltd., which is located in Xiangyang, Hubei Province.
由于新冠肺炎疫情“封城”后交通受阻，养殖行业遭遇了最严重问题——饲料拉不过来了。
As a result of the "closure" of the New Crown Pneumonia traffic obstruction, the aquaculture industry encountered the most serious problems - feed can not pull over.
“猪年不好过，鼠年也不好过。
"The Year of the Pig is not good, nor is the Year of the Rat.
”王东湖担心，如果把种猪都给饿死了，怎么保供给，恢复生产呢？“封城”带来的后果为防控疫情，1月23日自武汉开始，湖北省几乎所有地市都陆续“封城”。
"Wang Donghu worried that if the breeding pigs were starved to death, how to ensure supply and resume production The consequences of the" closure "were to prevent and control the outbreak, which began on January 23 in Wuhan, with nearly all cities in Hubei Province being" closed. "
在控制人员流动的同时，客观上也影响了物资流通。
While controlling the movement of people, it also affects the flow of goods objectively.
芝华数据研究总监袁松对第一财经记者表示，一方面是根据政策执行的主干交通的封锁，另一方面是民间自发的村级交通的封锁。
Yuan Song, director of data research at Zhihua, told the first financial reporter that on the one hand, the blockade of trunk traffic implemented under the policy and, on the other hand, the blockade of spontaneous village traffic.
饲料是持续消耗品，原料供应对物流依赖尤其严重，因此，交通的隔断，对需要持续不间断运转的养殖行业，冲击尤其大。
Feed is a continuous consumable, and the supply of raw materials is particularly dependent on logistics, so the isolation of transport is particularly damaging to the farming industry, which requires continuous and uninterrupted operations.
每年春节前后，物流都会暂停一段时间。
Every Spring Festival around the logistics will be suspended for a period of time.
根据行业惯例，饲料企业、养殖企业和养殖户都会提前预备一些饲料及原料。
According to industry practice, feed enterprises, livestock enterprises and farmers will be prepared in advance of some feed and raw materials.
据行业人士介绍，一般长途物流暂停时间在半个月左右，即春节前一周至春节后一周。
According to the industry, the general long-distance logistics pause in about half a month, that is, the Spring Festival before the week before the Spring Festival to a week after the Spring Festival.
正月初七以后，长途物流会逐步恢复。
After the first seven months, long-distance logistics will gradually recover.
短途物流暂停时间则较短。
Short-haul logistics pauses are shorter.
袁松称，养殖场会根据自身条件和资金实力的不同，备货物资支撑时间的长短不同，一般支撑时间是在春节后一周以内。
Yuan Song said that breeding farms will be based on their own conditions and financial strength, stock material support time varies, the general support time is within a week after the Spring Festival.
有些小养殖户，因为仓储和资金的限制，可能更多依赖经销商的备货，也就是春节期间也需要当地经销商通过短距物流来保障养殖场的饲料供应。
Some small farmers, because of storage and capital constraints, may rely more on the stock of dealers, meaning that local distributors are also required to secure feed supplies from farms through short-distance logistics during the Spring Festival.
而一些养殖企业也会为了减少运营成本，提高资金周转，而降低库存，从而依赖物流的稳定。
And some farming enterprises will reduce operating costs, improve the turnover of funds, and reduce inventory, thus relying on the stability of logistics.
不仅是猪，还有鸡。
Not just pigs, but chickens.
目前，湖北省大部分养鸡场的养殖量在几千羽到几万羽规模，库存最多的只能支撑到初七。
At present, most chicken farms in Hubei Province in the number of breeding thousands of feathers to tens of thousands of feathers, the largest stock can only support until the seventh.
从初二开始，就已经有养殖企业向主管部门申请办理运输车辆的通行证。
From the beginning of the second day of junior high school, there have been aquaculture enterprises to apply to the competent authorities for transport vehicles pass.
到了初三，就已出现饲料运输车辆因村口道路被封，而无法将饲料送达养殖场的情况。
By the third day of junior high school, there have been forage transport vehicles because of the closure of the village road, and feed can not be delivered to the farm.
也有养鸡场因为政府关闭活禽市场交易，后期销售无望，而提前将小鸡活埋处理，孵化到一半的鸡蛋做停孵处理。
There are chicken farms because the government closed the live poultry market transactions, late sales hopeless, and the chickens buried alive, hatched to half of the eggs for hatching processing.
中信建投期货农产品分析师姚桂玲对第一财经记者表示，根据湖北省内蛋鸡养殖户反映，饲料目前还有，但只能用最近几天。
Yao Guiling, an agricultural analyst at Citic Construction Futures, told the first financial reporter that according to egg-fowl farmers in Hubei province, fodder is still available, but only in the last few days.
如果饲料原料不能及时补进，会影响到后续饲料供给，目前养殖户已经在减少喂料量。
If feed raw materials can not be replenished in time, will affect the subsequent feed supply, the current farmers have been reducing feed.
同时为防疫情，企业推迟开工，想淘鸡但也淘不了。
At the same time for epidemic prevention, the enterprise postponed the start, want to panning chicken but can not buy.
在鸡蛋销售方面，大部分湖北省养殖户的鸡蛋是省外销售。
In terms of egg sales, most Hubei farm households sell their eggs outside the province.
然而，由于交通不畅，南方销区对湖北鸡蛋和车辆、外来人员都有限制，目前加工企业的鸡蛋采购也受到影响，原来以湖北蛋为主要渠道的企业，也采购不到湖北鸡蛋了。
However, due to poor traffic, the southern marketing area to Hubei eggs and vehicles, foreign personnel are limited, processing enterprises are also affected by the purchase of eggs, the original Hubei eggs as the main channel enterprises, also can not purchase Hubei eggs.
1月29日，中共湖北省委农办 湖北省农业农村厅发布《关于进一步积极配合做好新型冠状病毒感染肺炎疫情防控工作的通知》，强调重点建立“菜篮子”产品和饲料等生产投入品运输保障工作机制。
On January 29, the Agricultural and Rural Department of Hubei Province of the CPC Central Committee issued the Notice on Further Active Cooperation in the Prevention and Control of the Infection of New Coronavirus Pneumonia, emphasizing the establishment of a working mechanism for the transportation of inputs such as "basket" products and fodder.
业内人士介绍，因铁路、水路、公路交通管制，全国各地到湖北省的饲料原料运输受阻，湖北省养殖企业的饲料和饲料企业的原料供应面临断档危险，形势急迫，特别是大规模畜禽养殖企业如饲料断供更易出现畜禽饿死冻死病死，甚至引发严重疫情。
Because of railway, waterway and road traffic control, the transportation of feed materials from all over the country to Hubei Province has been blocked, and the supply of raw materials to feed and feed enterprises in Hubei Province is in danger of being disrupted.
据不完全统计，目前全省库存的商品饲料仅够维持2-3天，从1月29日到2月底，全省饲料原料（豆粕、玉米等原料）缺口近60万吨。
According to incomplete statistics, there is only enough commercial fodder in stock in the province for two to three days. From January 29 to the end of February, there was a shortfall of nearly 600,000 tons of feed raw materials (soybean meal, corn, etc.) throughout the province.
“切断”但不是“一刀切”“今天一早，我就安排人跟所有罐车司机打电话了，但一听说是去湖北，司机都不愿意去，增加运费也不行。
"Cutting off," but not "across the board" "This morning, I had someone call all the truck drivers, but when I heard it was going to Hubei, the driver didn't want to go.
”王东湖说。
'said Wang.
外地司机的担心有多重：担心感染；也担心货装上了，省道过不去。
Non-resident drivers worry about how much: fear of infection; they also worry about loading the goods and getting through the provincial roads.
就算过去了，担心从湖北回不来，那么车困在湖北的损失谁承担？人感染上了疫情责任谁承担？外地外地司机不敢来，湖北本省司机更是出不去。
Even if the past, worried about returning from Hubei, then the car stranded in Hubei who bear the loss? People infected with the epidemic who bear the responsibility? Field drivers dare not come, Hubei Province driver is unable to get out.
只要是湖北车牌、湖北身份证，外出拉饲料，在外省入境会受到阻碍。
As long as Hubei license plate, Hubei identity card, out to pull feed, in the provinces will be hindered entry.
基于扬翔防控非洲猪瘟的经验，王东湖认为，防控新冠肺炎可以采用“切断”的方法，但也不能一刀切。
Based on Yangxiang's experience in preventing and controlling African swine fever, Wang Donghu believes that the prevention and control of new crown pneumonia can be "cut off," but not across the board.
封路的目的是为了减少交叉感染，但是造成养殖场的畜禽没有饲料吃，就属于次生灾害。
The purpose of road closure is to reduce cross-infection, but livestock and poultry farms do not have feed to eat, is a secondary disaster.
袁松分析说，交通封锁带来的问题，主要有两方面：一是主干交通，水路和铁路的封锁导致大宗长途物流受阻。
Yuan Song analysis said that the traffic blockade brought problems, there are two main aspects: one is trunk transportation, waterways and railways blockade led to the blockage of long-distance logistics blocked.
水路和铁路运输是饲料企业大宗原料物流的主要方式，但是封城导致以湖北主要城市，特别是作为交通枢纽的武汉为目的地的水路和铁路运输几乎完全停止。
Waterways and railway transportation are the main modes of raw material logistics for feed enterprises, but the sealing of cities has led to a near complete cessation of waterways and railway transportation to Hubei major cities, especially Wuhan as a transportation hub.
袁松说，公路运输情况相对好一些，在申请获得通行许可后，高速公路和主干道路可以通行。
Mr. Yuan said road transport is relatively good and that highways and trunk roads can be used after permission has been granted.
但公路运输主要用于产品销售。
However, road transport is mainly used for product distribution.
而且从时间和成本方面考虑，饲料企业是难以承受的。
And in terms of time and cost, feed enterprises are difficult to bear.
二是村庄道路的封锁。
The other is the blockade of village roads.
这对养殖场也是致命影响。
This can also be fatal to fish farms.
袁松说，一些村庄为防止人员流动，将村口公路完全截断，导致交通运输也被截断。
Yuan Song said that some villages had completely cut off village access roads to prevent the movement of people, leading to traffic cuts.
养殖场的交通运输还是严重依赖村级公路的，远离村庄的养殖场在运输通道上也可能无法完全避开村庄。
Farm transport is still heavily dependent on village-level roads, and farms far from villages may not be able to avoid villages completely on transport corridors.
此前，农业农村部、交通运输部等多部委也已经下发紧急通知，为维护“菜篮子”产品和农业生产资料正常流通秩序，“严禁未经批准擅自设卡、拦截、断路阻断交通等违法行为”，“对未经批准擅自设卡、拦截、断路等阻断交通等违法行为，地方交通运输部门要立即报告当地党委、政府，依法恢复正常交通秩序”。
Previously, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and other ministries had also issued emergency circulars to "strictly prohibit the unauthorized erection of posts, interceptions and road-breakers to block traffic and other illegal activities," and to "report to local Party committees and governments immediately and restore normal traffic order according to law.
在业内看来，目前实际执行上还存在差距。
In the view of the industry, there is still a gap in actual implementation.
姚桂玲说，如果目前协调不好产销区的流通问题，后期产销区价格差应该会拉大、不均衡。
Yao Guiling said that if the current coordination of the distribution of production and marketing areas, the latter part of the price gap should be larger, uneven.
她建议缩小政策和实际执行中的差距，也可采取点对点措施，解决产销区的供需矛盾问题，在防控的同时，保证农业生产少受影响。
She suggested closing the gap between policy and implementation on the ground and adopting point-to-point measures to resolve supply-demand conflicts in production and marketing areas, while ensuring that agricultural production was not affected at the same time as prevention and control.
袁松认为，应尽快打通物流，至少要保障饲料原料能够进入湖北省市县地。
Yuan Song believes that logistics should be opened as soon as possible, at least to ensure that feed materials can enter Hubei Province.
一方面是批准养殖相关的产品流通，各地检查环节对养殖相关产品能给予检查后放行的许可。
On the one hand is to approve the circulation of aquaculture-related products, local inspection links to aquaculture-related products can be given clearance after inspection.
同时，水运和铁路运输主体企业开通至湖北的运输通道，至少能够实现点对点运输。
At the same time, the main enterprises of waterborne and railway transport open to Hubei, at least to achieve point-to-point transport.
