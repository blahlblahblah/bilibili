采访、撰文 | 吴楠投稿邮箱 | gayspot_edit@163.com马志远是2020年年初这一次来势汹汹的新冠肺炎疫情中的一名默默无闻的志愿者。
AT & nbsp; AT & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; Gayspot _ edit @ 163.com & # 160; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 160; & # 160; & # 160; & # 160; & # 160; & # 160; & # 160; & # 160; & # 160; & # 160; & # 160; & # 160; & # 160; & # 160; & # 160; & # 160; & # 160; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 160; & # 45; gayspot _ edit @ 163.com Ma Zhiyuan was an unknown volunteer in the aggressive outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia in early 2020.
虽然在远离疫区中心的地方，但他看着这个城市街头的人流量只有原来的二成，心头还是感到难言的冷寂。
Although far from the center of the epidemic area, he watched the city's streets with only 20% of the original traffic, still feel unspeakable silence.
而他因为没有工作，已经二十天没上过班。
He hadn't worked in twenty days because he didn't have a job.
2月14日，这一天是很多人眼中的情人节，却是马志远做志愿者的第十天。
February 14, this day is many people's eyes Valentine's Day, but Ma Zhiyuan volunteers day 10.
昨天忽然开始降温，他没有预料到。
It suddenly began to cool down yesterday. He didn't expect it.
风越来越大，也越来越尖。
The wind grew stronger and sharper.
这让马志远裹紧了羽绒服。
This allowed Ma Zhiyuan to wrap his down jacket tightly.
羽绒服两侧的口袋里，一只装着小喷壶，里面装着消毒剂。
In the pockets on either side of the down jacket was a small spray bottle containing disinfectant.
另一只装着一杯热水。
The other contained a cup of hot water.
马志远是土生土长的东北人，在每年的这个月份，他都习惯穿一条秋裤，外面套一条厚厚的抓绒裤。
Ma Zhiyuan, a native of the Northeast, is used to wearing a pair of fall trousers and a thick plush trousers this month.
可在外面站了四个小时，整个人从外到里的冻、从里到外的冷。
Can stand outside for four hours, the whole person from the outside to the cold, from the inside out cold.
马志远被“撂倒”了。
Ma Zhiyuan was "left behind."
昨天晚上到家的时候，马志远难以相信，这整整四个小时是怎么熬过来的。
When he got home last night, Ma Zhiyuan couldn't believe how the whole four hours had gone by.
一睁眼睛，天已经蒙蒙亮了。
Open your eyes, the sky has been clouded.
2月14日到了，这一天，社区给他排的班次是下午一点。
February 14 arrived, this day, the community gave him a scheduled shift is 1 pm.
现在是上午九点多，他还有些许不舒服。
It's past nine o'clock in the morning and he's a little uncomfortable.
但马志远很清楚，自己只是被冷空气袭击了，而不是被新冠病毒。
But Ma made it clear that he was just hit by cold air, not by the new crown virus.
不正常的人双手插在羽绒服的口袋里，走到已经有些许熟悉的老旧小区的门口，马志远比平时花的时间要短，也许是天冷所以加快了脚步的缘故。
The abnormal man put his hands in the pocket of his down jacket and walked to the door of the old neighborhood, which was a little familiar. Ma Zhiyuan spent less time than usual. Maybe it was cold so he quickened his pace.
远远地，他就发现，往日跟自己一起值班的社区工作人员、老年志愿者，今天都没在。
From a distance, he found that the community workers and elderly volunteers who used to be on duty with him were absent today.
“他们说今天还有别的工作。
"They say they have other jobs today.
”等着马志远接班的上一班志愿者说。
"said the last group of volunteers waiting for Ma to take over.
马志远强迫自己不要去想，是不是因为今天太冷了，所以没有人愿意来到这个小区门口值班。
Ma Zhiyuan forced himself not to think, is not because today is too cold, so no one would like to come to this community on duty.
不多想不多问，是这么多年的经历教会他的。
Not to ask more, it is so many years of experience taught him.
前一班的志愿者因为穿得太多，胳膊和腿像个玩偶一样，呈现某个角度张开着、合不拢。
The volunteers in the previous class, dressed too much, had arms and legs like dolls, and displayed an angle that was open and closed.
看着他们急匆匆却笨拙离开的背影，马志远有种傻乎乎的错觉。
Watching them hurriedly but clumsily leaving the back, Ma Zhiyuan has a kind of silly delusion.
他站了十几分钟。
He stood for ten minutes.
时不时，轻微的反胃让他察觉到自己还没有从昨天的“冻伤”中缓过来。
From time to time, a mild nausea made him realize he had not recovered from yesterday's frostbite.
幸运的是，一位并不熟识的社区工作人员小跑着过来，告诉他，社区找到了一个岗亭，他可以去岗亭里面取取暖。
Luckily, an unfamiliar community worker trotted up and told him that the community had found a kiosk inside which he could get warm.
只是岗亭距离大门有点远，看到有居民出入，需要从岗亭里走出来，小跑到门口，让居民登记。
Only the pavilion is a little far from the gate, to see the entry and exit of residents, need to come out of the kiosk, trot to the door, let residents register.
马志远立刻同意了。
Ma agreed immediately.
这是上世纪九十年代初建设成的小区，最高的楼只有六层，或许在当时是很现代的，所以现在居住着很多人，绝大部分都是五六十岁的老人。
It was a small area built in the early 1990s. The tallest building had only six floors. Perhaps it was very modern at the time, so now there are many people, most of them in their fifties and sixties.
年轻人是不愿意住在这样的小区的。
Young people don't want to live in such a neighborhood.
那些楼看起来就好像住在这里的人一般，沉默、灰暗、寂静。
The buildings looked as if they were people living here, silent, gray, silent.
“看起来没有档次。
"It doesn't look good.
”马志远住的小区，距离这个小区，步行只要十分钟，也是一个老旧小区。
Ma's neighborhood, a ten-minute walk from the neighborhood, is also an old neighborhood.
已经36岁、今年恰好是本命年的他，愿意藏在这样的小区里。
Already 36 years old, this year is exactly his life year, he would like to hide in such a small area.
他不喜欢到处都是监控、保安、人工造景的现代小区，藏起来的感觉让他很舒服。
He doesn't like modern neighborhoods filled with surveillance, security, and artificial scenes, and he feels comfortable hiding.
而住处和做志愿者的小区距离不远，这或许是他来这里做志愿者的理由之一。
The distance between his place of residence and the neighborhood where he volunteers is probably one of the reasons he volunteers here.
岗亭很小，一个人可以坐着，俩个人要你挨着我、我挨着你挤着站。
The pavilion is small, sitting alone, two people want you to be next to me, I press next to you to stand.
马志远在岗亭里呆了不到半小时，有一位六十多岁的老人敲岗亭的门，“小伙子，我家里有个电暖器，你来取吧！”马志远拒绝了。
Ma Zhiyuan stayed in the pavilion for less than half an hour, when an old man in his sixties knocked at the door of the guard post. "Young man, I have an electric heater in my house. Come and get it!" Ma refused.
这样的小区供暖都不好，加上老年人都很怕冷，这也许是老人自己取暖用的。
Such small area heating is not good, and the elderly are very afraid of cold, this may be used by the elderly themselves for heating.
又过了一会，远远的，他就看到，老人自己搬着电暖器，步履缓慢而吃力，走几步歇几步。
After a while, far away, he saw the old man walking slowly and laboriously with his electric heater. He took a few steps.
马志远忙迎了出去。
Ma Zhiyuan rushed out.
他心里很感动。
He was deeply moved.
但他马上想到，如果老人知道自己是一个“不正常”的人，还会对自己这么好吗？ 匹夫有责电暖器接上了，岗亭里慢慢开始升温，马志远感到从脚到小腿再到大腿，热度像是小藤蔓，缓缓爬上来。
But it occurred to him that if the old man knew he was an "abnormal" person, would he be so kind to himselfPippin had an electric heater attached and the guard booth began to warm up slowly.
今天是最近日子里为数不多的冷天。
Today is one of the few cold days in recent days.
也许过了今天，春天就要到来了。
Maybe after today, spring is coming.
因为冷，几乎没什么人出来。
Very few people came out because of the cold.
就连平时经常能看到的买菜的老人，也看不到了。
Even the old man, who can often see the food, can't see it.
天气预报说，马上就要下雪了。
The weather forecast says it will snow soon.
“或许是上午就已经出门买完菜了吧！”这是马志远第二次做志愿者。
"Perhaps the morning has already gone out to buy vegetables!" This is Ma Zhiyuan's second time as a volunteer.
上一次还是在北京奥运，他到社区去，开门见山，也不管对方是不是社区的工作人员，上来就说自己想当志愿者。
The last time he was in Beijing, he went to the community and said he wanted to be a volunteer, whether he was from the community or not.
这一次，社区同样没有特别多地询问，只是简单地登记，甚至没有对马志远的个人信息进行核实，除了他的手机号以外，连住在哪里都没有问。
This time, too, the community did not ask much more than simply register, did not even check his personal information and did not even ask where he lived, except for his cell phone number.
登记完，社区告诉他，明天就可以去某某小区，主要工作是让每一个出入的居民在本子上做好登记。
After registration, the community told him that tomorrow can go to the so-called community, the main work is to let every resident in and out of the book to do a good registration.
“在这样的时候，有谁会没事出来编瞎话说自己要做志愿者呢？都是认真的。
"At a time like this, who's going to come out and tell lies about volunteering? It's serious.
”马志远还在为社区找着理由。
Mr Ma is still trying to find reasons for the community.
第二天是2月4日。
The next day was February 4.
很不巧，那天也降温，是半个月之内，气温最低的一天，温度降到了零下十九度。
Unfortunately, the day also cooled, is half a month, the temperature is the lowest day, the temperature fell to minus 19 degrees.
和今天不同的是，那天值班的人有四个。
Unlike today, there were four people on duty that day.
没有发放防护用品、消毒用品，没有任何预防技巧和知识上的指导，甚至没有饭、没有保暖、没有任何标识佩戴，就连他是谁，也没有人过问，志愿者的工作匆忙展开了。
No protective supplies, no disinfectant supplies, no preventive techniques, no intellectual guidance, not even a meal, no warmth, no logo, even who he was, no one asked, the volunteer's work began in a hurry.
马志远走过来，另外三个人主动点点头，“来了？”马志远点点头。
Ma Zhiyuan came over and the other three nodded. "Coming?" Ma Zhiyuan nodded.
他就这样上岗了。
So he took up his post.
马志远告诉自己，反正每天也要出门买菜，还不如在外面多呆一会儿。
Ma told himself that it would be better to stay out a little longer than to go out shopping every day anyway.
他爱说的一句话，只有四个字，“匹夫有责”。
He likes to say a word, only four words, "Pie Fu is responsible."
既然是匹夫，既然有责，为什么要要求那么多？马志远的性格非常沉默。
Since it is Piff, since there is a responsibility, why to ask so much? Ma Zhiyuan's character is very silent.
2008年，他从父母家搬了出来。
In 2008, he moved out of his parents' house.
一晃儿，十二年过去了。
Twelve years went by.
他越来越习惯，每天下班后，回到家，一边煮饭一边做菜，一边放着老电影。
He became more and more used to coming home from work every day, cooking and cooking while there were old movies.
吃过饭、洗完碗、洗好水果、打开薯片，一个人看完一部电影，在十点前睡去。
Eat, wash the dishes, wash the fruit, open the chips, watch a movie by yourself and go to bed by ten.
甚至连自己的声音，他都不喜欢听。
He did not even like to hear his own voice.
马志远不确定，究竟是不想听自己的声音，还是不喜欢自己的声音。
Ma is far from sure whether he wants to listen to his voice or not.
他只是越来越不爱说话了。
He's just getting less talkative.
马志远刻意地孤立着自己、远离着人群，因为他不想让任何人知道，自己喜欢的是同性。
Ma Zhiyuan deliberately isolated himself, away from the crowd, because he did not want anyone to know that he likes the same-sex.
在这个东北的小城，这还是他的秘密。
It was his secret in the small town of the northeast.
而这一次，“匹夫有责”。
And this time, "the husband is responsible."
或许在内心深处，他还是渴望着和人们多些接触。
Deep down, perhaps, he was eager to get in touch with people.
高高壮壮的男人不知不觉，已经过去了两个多小时。
More than two hours had passed before the tall, stout man knew it.
马志远在心里感慨，真的是老小区啊，连一个谈恋爱的年轻人都没有来过这里。
Ma Zhiyuan in the heart sigh, is really the old community ah, even a young person in love has not been here.
今天可是情人节呢！这些日子里，他看到的都是出门买菜或者遛弯的五六十岁的老年人。
Today is Valentine's Day! These days, all he sees are people in their fifties and sixties who are out shopping or walking around.
在他的心中，这里就好像是一个简陋的大型“养老院”。
In his mind, this is like a simple large "old people's home."
已经单身一年多的马志远并没有奢望过爱情。
Have been single for more than a year Ma Zhiyuan did not expect love.
爱情与生活，对他来说，每一次赢的都是生活。
Love and life, to him, every time you win is life.
“爱情这件事，随机的因素太多。
"There are too many random factors in love.
”大学毕业那一年，马志远没有按照父母的想法去找一份稳定的工作。
In the year after graduating from college, Ma did not follow his parents' wishes to find a stable job.
从哈尔滨回到这个他一直读到高中才离开的城市，那接下来的小半年时间，是他内心最压抑的日子。
From Harbin back to the city, where he stayed until high school, the next half year was the most depressing day in his heart.
“一方面父母催着你，不停地问你，为什么不找一个专业对口的工作？一方面又问你，要不要先买个房子、找个女朋友？”马志远非常不想回忆这段日子。
"On the one hand, parents urge you, keep asking you, why not find a professional counterpart job? On the one hand, ask you, do you want to buy a house, find a girlfriend?" Ma Zhiyuan very much do not want to recall these days.
那一年马上入冬前，马志远找到了一份快递员的工作，一直做到了今天。
That year just before the winter, Ma Zhiyuan found a job as a courier, has been achieved today.
最开始，他只是太闷了。
At first, he was just too stuffy.
与其坐在办公室里，被人不停地逼迫和询问，还不如轻松自在地骑着电动车，在城市的大街小巷里逛着。
Instead of sitting in your office, constantly being forced and questioned, you might as well just ride an electric car around the streets of the city.
“被父母逼迫得已经喘不过气来了，不想继续被工作憋着。
"Forced by their parents to be out of breath, do not want to continue to be suffocated by work.
”马志远知道，自己在父母眼中，变得很奇怪。
Ma knew that he had become strange in his parents' eyes.
忽一抬头，有一个没见过的男人走进了小区。
Suddenly looked up, has not seen a man walked into the community.
马志远迟疑了下，他不是很敢去管。
Ma Zhiyuan hesitated, he did not dare to be very much in charge.
看起来这个男人有一米八几，如果一言不合，被推搡几下，也是自己吃闷亏。
It seems that this man is more than eight meters, if not a word, was pushed several times, is to eat their own dull loss.
“并不是我胆小，而是犯不上。
"Not that I am timid, but that I am not.
我是做志愿者，也不是真的社区管理人员，我就是协助。
I'm a volunteer, I'm not a real community manager, I'm a helper.
”但想了想，他还是推开了岗亭的铁皮门，小跑过去。
But on second thought, he pushed open the tin door of the pavilion and trotted over.
自从开始实施登记后，很多老人都习惯了在门口桌子上的出入记录簿上登记。
Since the introduction of registration, many old people have become used to registering in the access book at the door table.
尽管在那个半月形的小区入口旁，今天并没有人站岗，但依然可以清晰看到摆放在破桌子上的登记簿，和一个压在桌面上的提醒卡，上面写着“请登记”。
Despite the fact that no one stood guard today near the entrance to the half-moon, the register on the broken table and a reminder card pressed on the table, which said, "Please register."
一开始并不是这样的。
That was not the case at first.
马志远一般都是唠家常一样，对进入小区的人打招呼，“这是出去买菜吗？来，做个登记吧！”绝大部分人都很听话，甚至还会站在马志远的身边和他拉拉家常。
Ma Zhiyuan would normally converse to people entering the area, saying, "Is this going out to buy food? Come on, do a check-in!" Most people are obedient and even stand beside Ma Zhiyuan and his family.
马志远平时是没什么机会、也不会这样和别人聊天的。
Ma Zhiyuan usually has few opportunities and won't talk to others like this.
通常聊了几句，马志远就会和对方讲，“现在疫情严重，不要出来逛了，快回家吧！”但还是会有很少一部分人，一听“登记”两个字，就先嚷了起来，炸了一般，“我就是回家，登记干什么！你还能不让我回家！我还不信了。
Usually chatted a few words, Ma Zhiyuan and the other side will say, "Now the epidemic is serious, do not come out, go home!" But a small number of people, listening to the word "registration," began to cry, "I just go home, registration for what! You can not let me home!
”马志远最多会说一句，“是社区让的。
"Ma Zhiyuan can say at most," It was the community that made it.
”大多数情况下，他就不会再多说什么了。
"Most of the time, he would say nothing more.
实际上很多有物业的小区的管理比这样的老旧小区要严格的多。
In fact, the management of many residential properties than such an old residential area is much more stringent.
有的是电子登记，有的是体感测温，甚至还有人负责消毒。
There are electronic registers, somatic temperature measurements and even sterilization.
等马志远从岗亭里跑出去，才发现又开始下雪了，细细碎碎。
Waiting for Ma Zhiyuan to run out of the guard booth, only to find that it began to snow, fine crushing.
马志远不喜欢冷，但喜欢雪。
Ma Zhiyuan doesn't like cold, but likes snow.
就在这么迟疑的功夫，那个高壮男人已经走得只剩背影。
With so much hesitation, the stout man had gone only behind his back.
马志远没有出声，但默默地看了一会。
Ma Zhi did not say a word, but looked at it silently for a moment.
马志远知道，他喜欢的男人类型就是这样高高壮壮的。
Ma knew that the type of man he liked was so tall and strong.
或许因为自己太瘦小的缘故。
Maybe because I'm too skinny.
做快递员的时候，在这个城市最繁华的商品批发市场，他丢过一电动车的快件。
As a courier, he lost an electric-car express at one of the city's busiest wholesale markets.
马志远甚至都没有报警。
Ma didn't even call the police.
尽管后来其他的快递员都说，应该报警的，至少可能会减少一些损失。
Although other couriers later said they should have called the police, at least there might have been some loss.
可他坚持不肯。
But he would not.
马志远怕别人知道，那一天，他看着一位高高壮壮的男人出了神，在商场里走错了路，因此多花了十几分钟才绕出来。
Ma Zhiyuan was afraid others would know, that day, he watched a tall and stout man out of his mind, the wrong way in the mall, so it took a few more minutes to get around.
出来的时候，他发现自己那辆习惯性不拔下钥匙的电动车，连同后座上土黄色大塑料箱里的十几个快递都消失了。
As he came out, he found his habitual key-skidding electric car, along with a dozen or so couriers in a large khaki-coloured plastic box in the back seat.
马志远也有过男朋友，但那是他的私事，不会和任何人分享。
Ma Zhiyuan also has a boyfriend, but that is his personal matter, will not share with anyone.
“这个世界上，除了我和男友，不会有人知道我喜欢男人这件事。
"Nobody in the world except my boyfriend and I would know that I like guys.
”马志远说他和男友在一起的时候，尽量不争吵，一旦吵架，他就有直觉，“距离我们分开的日子不远了。
Ma said he tried not to argue when he was with his boyfriend, but once he got into a fight, he had a hunch, 'We're not far away.
”马志远做快递员，遇到过很多客人。
"Ma Zhiyuan worked as a courier and met lots of people.
绝大部分都是彼此都不会留什么印象的。
Most of them don't make much impression on each other.
少数的客人会因为一点小事不高兴，然后吼他。
A few guests will be unhappy about a little incident and then yell at him.
“我为什么要和他们对着吵？反而自己会更累，心情更不好。
"Why should I quarrel with them? I am more tired and in a worse mood.
”马志远会不反驳，“而且我也不怕投诉。
Ma would not argue, "and I'm not afraid to complain.
他们喜欢，可以尽情投诉。
They like it and they can complain.
”马志远知道，就算是投诉，也不会有人真的处理，“会有人专门给这样的客人回复，就说已经好好管理了、加强教育了，其实该啥样还是啥样。
Mr Ma knows that complaints, if they are, will not be dealt with. "There will be people who will respond by saying that they have managed and strengthened their education, but what they should be."
”快递员之间的关系都比较松散，聊得来可以下班以后吃吃饭，聊不来就各回各家。
The couriers were loosely connected, and they were able to have dinner after work and go home when they could not talk.
马志远在这样的氛围里很轻松自在。
Ma Zhiyuan is very relaxed in such an atmosphere.
在小区门口转了一圈，马志远转身返回了岗亭。
Around the gate of the community, Ma Zhiyuan turned around and returned to the pavilion.
在岗亭里，他只是看着外面。
In the guardhouse, he was just looking out.
在整个值班的时间，除非来电话，他是不会碰手机的。
He won't touch the phone unless he calls during the whole shift.
马志远觉得自己的手不干净。
Ma felt his hands were not clean.
以前习惯于用手机支付，最近这段马志远开始随身带钱，“反正每天都去当志愿者，顺路买点菜。
Formerly used to pay with his mobile phone, Ma recently started taking money with him. "Volunteer every day anyway, and stop by to buy some food.
” 一碗汤圆虽然身体不舒服，马志远还是坚持到了情人节下午四点，结束这个班次。
Despite the discomfort of a bowl of soup, Ma held out until four o'clock in the afternoon on Valentine's Day, ending the shift.
到了晚上，就没有志愿者会继续看着这扇门了。
At night, no volunteer will continue to look at the door.
没有人有办法可以一直在这样寒冷的天气里站在户外。
No one can stand outside all the time in such cold weather.
每天回家的路上，马志远都会短暂思索一下，要不要回父母家。
Every day on his way home, Ma Zhiyuan would briefly consider whether to go back to his parents' home.
“虽然是情人节，可是路上都没看到捧着玫瑰花的情侣。
"Though it was Valentine's Day, I didn't see any lovers with roses on the road.
”最近这两年，父母不再念叨他，他回家的次数也渐渐多了起来。
"In the last two years his parents had stopped talking about him and he had come home more and more often.
可和父母之间的交谈，不知道为什么，就是没有在当志愿者、看大门的时候，和那些陌生的老大爷、老大娘聊得多。
Can talk with their parents, do not know why, is not when the volunteers, looking at the door, and those strange old man, old woman chatted much more.
元宵节那天的下午班次，只有马志远一个人。
On the afternoon shift of the Lantern Festival, only Ma Zhiyuan was alone.
一辆越野车停在了小区那扇半月形的门外，马志远以为是有外人过来，正要迎上去询问。
A Land Cruiser parked outside the half-moon of the neighborhood, and Ma Zhiyuan thought an outsider was coming to meet him for questioning.
看到从车上下来的，是一位这几天经常能看到的老奶奶。
See from the car, is a few days often can see the old woman.
看到马志远走过来，老奶奶笑着说，“是我儿子送我回来。
Seeing Ma Zhiyuan coming, the old woman smiled and said, "My son sent me back.
”马志远点点头，笑了笑。
Ma Zhiyuan nodded and smiled.
老人本来已经走了过去，但似乎想起了什么，又折返回来，对着马志远说，“小伙子，今天元宵节，你还没吃到汤圆吧？我回家给你煮一碗，你等一下。
"The old man had already passed by, but he seemed to think of something, turned back and said to Ma Zhiyuan," Young man, today's Lantern Festival, you haven't had any soup.
”马志远的心里又暖又酸，“我等下回家。
"Ma Zhiyuan's heart was warm and sour.
”顿了顿，又补充道，“回我父母家。
"After a pause, he added," Go home to my parents.
”那天，是大年初四之后，马志远第一次回家。
That day, four years after the beginning of the year, Ma went home for the first time.
他特意换了洗干净的衣服，不想把病毒的可能带回父母家。
He purposely changed his clean clothes and didn't want to take the virus back to his parents' house.
2月14日临睡前，马志远收到了社区工作人员的短信，“根据天气预报，今晚到明天上午暴雪。
Before going to bed on February 14, Ma received a text message from community workers. "According to the weather forecast, blizzard tonight to tomorrow morning.
按照工作安排，请志愿者参与明日中午十二点开始的扫雪工作。
According to the work schedule, volunteers are invited to take part in the snow-clearing work which starts at noon tomorrow.
