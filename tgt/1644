记者/郭慧敏 实习记者/胡琪琛编辑/石爱华宋建华一线员工在医院准备清运医疗废物新冠肺炎疫情爆发期间，医疗废物（以下称“医废”）数量大幅增长，武汉乃至全国医疗废物处置能力面临挑战。
Reporter / Guo Huimin intern / editor / Shi Aihua Song Jianhua front-line staff at the hospital preparing to clear the outbreak of clinical waste New Crown Pneumonia outbreak, the number of medical waste (hereinafter referred to as "medical waste") increased significantly, posing challenges to the medical waste disposal capacity in Wuhan and throughout the country.
为缓解这一情况，众多单位组队支援武汉医废处理。
To alleviate this situation, a number of units in support of Wuhan waste disposal.
湖北襄阳市中油优艺环保科技有限公司是其中之一。
Hubei Xiangyang Zhongyou Eco Technology Co. Ltd is one of them.
1月30日，第一批支援队伍从襄阳出发前往武汉，截至目前已出动四批援助力量，共85名工作人员，35辆医废运输车。
On January 30, the first support teams set out for Wuhan from Xiangyang. So far, four batches of aid have been dispatched, with a total of 85 staff and 35 medical and waste transport vehicles.
针对目前武汉市医废产量、处置能力、待解问题，深一度采访了中油优艺董事长王春山。
Aiming at the current production capacity, disposal capacity and problems to be solved, Wang Chunshan, chairman of CNOOC, was interviewed at one time.
根据《武汉市2018年固体废物污染环境防治信息公告》，2018年武汉市医疗废物产生量1.73万吨，处置量1.73万吨。
According to the 2018 Wuhan Municipal Solid Waste Environmental Contamination Information Proclamation, 18,300 tons of medical waste were generated and 17,300 tons disposed of in Wuhan city.
王春山估算，疫情发生到现在，武汉每天的医废产生量上百吨，是平时的约三倍。
Wang Chunshan estimates that the outbreak has so far, Wuhan daily amount of waste production of 100 tons, is about three times the usual.
为了实现医疗废物的“日产日清”，前线工人面临超负荷工作，医废桶紧缺的情况。
In order to realize the medical waste "Nissan Nissan Qing," front-line workers face a situation of overwork, shortage of medical waste barrels.
“襄阳有一千多感染者，每天的医废产生量增加了10吨，武汉市有六万多感染者，医废处置压力可想而知。
"Xiangyang has more than a thousand infected people, the daily amount of medical waste increased by 10 tons, Wuhan City has more than 60,000 infected people, waste disposal pressure can be imagined.
”等待运输、处置的医疗废物武汉医废日产生量是平常三倍深一度：武汉目前的医疗废物现状如何？王春山：目前武汉市每天的医废产生量没有一个确定的数据。
The amount of medical waste produced in Wuhan is three times as deep as usual: What is the current status of medical waste in Wuhan? Wang Chunshan: There is no definite data on the amount of medical waste produced every day in Wuhan.
我们从一线反馈了解的情况，1月底，武汉医废产量大概是每天70吨，2月初达到每天80吨，最近能达到100吨以上，是以往平时的近三倍。
As far as we know from the first line of feedback, the output of medical waste in Wuhan was about 70 tons per day at the end of January, 80 tons per day in early February, and more than 100 tons recently, nearly three times the usual level.
深一度：武汉医废处置能力如何？王春山：一般来说，医废企业所有的设施建设都会在正常标准的基础之上，额外增加一些余量来建设。
Once deep: Wuhan medical waste disposal capacity? Wang Chunshan: In general, all facilities construction of waste medical enterprises will be on the basis of normal standards, some additional allowance to build.
据我所知，武汉本地的医废处置企业目前只有汉氏环保工程有限公司一家。
As far as I know, Wuhan local waste disposal enterprises only Hanshi Environmental Protection Engineering Co. Ltd.
实际上，这家企业几年前就面临着改建和扩建的问题，但由于种种原因没有实施。
In fact, the company faced the problem of alteration and expansion a few years ago, but for a variety of reasons did not implement.
现在汉氏一天最多能处理50吨医废。
Han can now dispose of up to 50 tons of medical waste a day.
深一度：湖北省一共有多少家医废处理企业，有多少家在支援武汉？王春山：湖北省每个地级市都有一家专门处理医废的企业。
Once upon a time: How many medical waste treatment enterprises in Hubei Province, how many enterprises are supporting Wuhan? Wang Chunshan: There is a special enterprise dealing with medical waste in every prefecture-level city in Hubei Province.
目前，中国节能环保集团有两辆车在帮忙收集医废，中国环境基金会也捐了几辆车，我能了解到的支援情况就这些。
At present, two vehicles of China Energy Conservation Environmental Protection Group are helping to collect medical waste, and the China Environment Foundation has donated several vehicles. That is all I can learn.
深一度：你们是否具备支援条件？王春山：疫情爆发以后，突然间增加这么多的医废量，哪一家企业也不可能单独承担解决。
Once upon a time: Do you have the support conditions? Wang Chunshan: After the outbreak of the outbreak, suddenly increased the number of medical waste, which enterprises can not bear alone to solve.
2019年，我们公司刚在襄阳新建了一个厂子，又购入了五十几台医废运输车。
In 2019, our company has just built a new factory in Xiangyang, and bought more than fifty medical waste transporters.
这批车还没有给各个分厂分配出去，正派上用场。
The cars have not been distributed to the various branches and are now in use.
武汉那边不仅是处置能力不足，收集运输方面也跟不上，我们正好具备医废运输、处置的条件，肯定要去支持同行。
Wuhan is not only inadequate disposal capacity, collection and transportation aspects also can not keep up with, we happen to have the conditions of waste transport, disposal, must support peers.
深一度：支援队伍到武汉的感受如何？王春山：我是跟第三批支援队伍一起来的，下午一点多从襄阳出发，六点左右进入武汉城区。
Once upon a time: How did the support team feel when they went to Wuhan? Wang Chunshan: I came with the third support group.
因为车辆限高等原因，我们的车队在城区跑了六个多小时才从城区西北部转到东南部的湖北省人民医院，这个过程中几乎没有碰到任何人和车。
Because of the high vehicular limit, our convoy was able to travel more than six hours from the north-west to the south-eastern Hubei Provincial People's Hospital, meeting few people or cars.
我们在城市已经习惯了车水马龙，现在整个城市只剩下灯光。
We've got used to the traffic in the city, and now there's only light left in the city.
除了支援车辆，武汉街头很少见到人员和车辆医废运回襄阳焚烧处理深一度：什么时间出发援助？王春山：我们的第一批援助力量在1月30日就出发前往武汉了。
Apart from supporting vehicles, Wuhan streets rarely see personnel and vehicle waste back to Xiangyang incinerator treatment: When to set out to assist? Wang Chunshan: Our first aid forces set out for Wuhan on January 30th.
截至目前共有四批援助力量，一共85个工作人员，35辆车，其中大车10辆，运力14吨，25辆小车，运力1.5吨。
So far, there have been four groups of assistance forces, with a total of 85 staff and 35 vehicles, of which 10 are carts with a capacity of 14 tons and 25 carts with a capacity of 1.5 tons.
深一度：疫情之下，工人们到武汉支援有准备吗？王春山：我们在工作群里发了消息，大家自愿报名后，我们再根据情况进行调配。
At one point: Is the workers ready to come to Wuhan to support the epidemic? Wang Chunshan: We have sent messages from the work group.
因为襄阳这边也面临着同样的问题，医废量由平时的10吨左右增长到现在的20吨，医废车也由9辆增加到20辆，我们需要在保证完成襄阳医废处理任务的基础之上，安排支援武汉的工作。
Since Xiangyang is facing the same problem, the quantity of medical waste has increased from about 10 tons in peacetime to 20 tons today, and the number of scrap vehicles has increased from 9 to 20.
深一度：一线工人防护措施是否到位？王春山：我们平时就比较注意防护，有一些长期性的物资储备，包括口罩、护目镜、手套、防护服、消毒液等。
Once upon a time: Is the protective measures in place for front-line workers? Wang Chunshan: We pay more attention to the protection in normal times, and we have some long-term material reserve, including masks, goggles, gloves, protective clothing, disinfectant, etc.
其中防护服只有基本储备，需要的时候随时打电话订货。
Protective clothing only basic reserves, when the need to call order.
疫情爆发之后我们立即购买了一批物资，但是到后期供应跟不上，买也买不来。
We bought a lot of supplies immediately after the outbreak, but we couldn't keep up with them and couldn't buy them.
现阶段，政府给了我们很多物资支持，才能保证公司的正常运转。
At this stage, the government has given us a lot of material support to ensure the normal operation of the company.
得益于相对到位的安全管理，到目前为止，我们公司一千多员工没有一例感染。
Thanks to the relative safety management in place, our company has not had a single infection among more than a thousand employees so far.
深一度：你们的清运范围是什么？王春山：现在的清运范围几乎涉及武汉全部的医院，包括部分火神山医院的医废清运工作。
Once upon a time: What is the scope of your transportation? Wang Chunshan: Now the scope of clearance almost all the hospitals in Wuhan, including part of the Fosen Mountain Hospital cleaning and transportation work.
2月18号，我们跟武汉市环保局进行了沟通，他们说会马上给我们划出七八家比较大的医院，由我们直接负责医废处理，这样便于整体协调和管理。
On Feb. 18, we spoke with Wuhan Environmental Protection Bureau, and they said they would immediately designate seven or eight of our larger hospitals, where we would be directly responsible for the treatment of medical waste, thus facilitating overall coordination and management.
深一度：员工的工作状态怎么样？王春山：第一批来的员工已经连续工作二十多天了，其他员工也大部分处于连续运转的状态，都是超负荷。
Once upon a time: How are employees doing? Wang Chunshan: The first batch of employees has been working for more than twenty days in a row.
我们给在武汉的员工安排了专门的住处，支援过后返回襄阳的人也要先回宾馆隔离。
We have arranged special accommodation for our staff in Wuhan, and those who return to Xiangyang after support will have to go back to the hotel to be isolated.
深一度：工人具体的工作时间是怎样安排的？王春山：每天早上八点左右，武汉各区环保局会来通知我们当日的行车路线，司机师傅直接过去清运。
Wang Chunshan: At about 8 a.m. every morning, the Environmental Protection Bureaus of Wuhan will come to let us know the route of the day.
小车装满后到中转处转给大车，大车装满后就回襄阳。
The cart is full and then transferred to the staging area to the cart, after the cart is full back to Xiangyang.
现在基本上一天回一趟回襄阳，一般都是下午出发。
Now basically go back to Xiangyang once a day, usually in the afternoon.
来之前，我们充分沟通过工作的具体内容，但是依然存在各种意外。
Before coming, we had fully communicated the specifics of our work, but there were still surprises.
一开始，我们按照两到三天的时间调派人手，最多不超过一个星期。
At first, we were deployed for two to three days, for a maximum of one week.
来了武汉以后才发现，我们的支援不是应急性质的，可能要持续到武汉市防控指挥逐渐降级之后，目前没有看到医废产生量减少、工作量降低的趋势。
After coming to Wuhan, we found that our support is not emergency nature, may continue until Wuhan city control command gradually downgraded, has not seen a reduction in waste production, workload trend.
医疗废物从武汉运到襄阳后，投入回转炉进行焚烧处理焚烧后作为固废填埋处理深一度：这次疫情，武汉定点医院的医废都有什么？王春山：医院里除了生活垃圾以外，基本都属于医疗废物。
After the medical waste is transported from Wuhan to Xiangyang, it is put into the incinerator to be incinerated and then treated as a solid waste landfill.
比如针管、针头、输液用品、手术器械、防护服，以及病人使用过的东西。
Examples are syringes, needles, infusions, surgical instruments, protective clothing, and things that patients have used.
特别是疫情期间，被感染者所有的东西都要作为医疗废物处理，包括床单、被子、褥子、垫子、餐盒等等。
In particular, during the outbreak, all of the infected persons' belongings are treated as medical waste, including sheets, quilts, mattresses, mattresses, meal boxes, etc.
目前医院区几乎所有垃圾都被归为医疗废物，因为你不知道这些东西有没有病毒。
Almost all the garbage in the hospital area is now classified as medical waste because you don't know if it has viruses in it.
深一度：医废的清运流程是怎样的？王春山：我们的清运工作从“医废上车”开始。
Deep once: What is the cleaning process of medical waste? Wang Chunshan: Our cleaning and transportation work starts from "medical waste on the bus."
如果大型运输车能够进入医院，就直接把院方装好箱的医废搬运上车运回襄阳，如果大车进不去，就用小型车去医院收集，然后在固定地点转移到大车上。
If the large transport vehicles can enter the hospital, they can be transported to Xiangyang directly from the hospital where the hospital has packed the boxes. If the big cars are unable to get in, use small cars to collect them and then transfer them to buses at a fixed location.
在搬上车之前，工作人员会用84消毒液对医废桶进行喷雾消毒，搬上车之后再对车厢内外分别消毒，期间工作人员都穿着防护服，带着护目镜、口罩和手套。
Before moving in, the waste buckets were sprayed with disinfectant 84 and then disinfected inside and outside of the car, during which time the staff wore protective clothing, goggles, masks and gloves.
医废运回襄阳公司之后，首先要过磅得出准确数量。
After shipping medical waste back to Xiangyang company, we must first weigh out the exact quantity.
大部分医院不具备过磅能力，只是按照医废桶的数量进行估算，每桶的重量大概在五十到一百斤之间，有时候一个桶里只装一床被子，没几斤重但很占地方。
Most hospitals do not have the weight of the capacity, only according to the number of waste barrels estimated, the weight of a barrel of about 50 to 100 jin, sometimes only a bucket of a quilt, not a weight but a lot of space.
最后，医废投入回转窑焚烧，焚烧之后的残渣作为固体废物运到垃圾场填埋。
Finally, medical waste is incinerated in rotary kilns, and residues after incineration are transported to landfills as solid waste.
深一度：焚烧之后的残渣还具有危险性吗？王春山：基本不具备危险性。
Once Deep: Is the residue after burning dangerous? Wang Chunshan: Not dangerous at all.
焚烧后的炉渣只剩下无机物，所有有毒有害的成分都已经消灭掉了，焚烧室的温度可达一千一百多度，病毒病菌无法存在。
Inorganic remains of the incinerated slag, all toxic and harmful ingredients have been eliminated, the temperature of the incinerator can reach more than 1,100 degrees, the virus bacteria can not exist.
深一度：类似新冠肺炎这样的传染病医废与普通医废在处置流程上有何不同？王春山：整体流程差不多，但传染病医废处置对防护的要求更加严格。
Deep One: How is the disposal process different between infectious diseases such as Newly Coronary Pneumonia? Wang Chunshan: The whole process is similar, but the requirements of waste disposal for infectious diseases are more stringent.
尤其是收集运输的过程，我们与医废直接接触，被感染概率较高。
In particular, the collection and transportation process, we are in direct contact with medical waste, the probability of infection is high.
医废桶都是从感染区出来的，装运过程中无法保证桶上没有任何病毒沾染，喷雾消毒属于简易消毒，做不到全面无死角。
Waste drums are from the infected area, the shipping process can not guarantee that there is no virus contamination on the barrel, spray sterilization is a simple disinfection, can not achieve a comprehensive no dead angle.
平时的话，工人佩戴口罩和手套就行。
Normally, workers wear masks and gloves.
但是类似新冠肺炎的传染病医废，在收集运输时，护目镜、帽子、全身防护服、手套、口罩都需要，除了护目镜可以在消毒之后循环使用，剩下的防护设备每天都得更换。
But when collecting and transporting infectious diseases like pneumonia, goggles, hats, body protective clothing, gloves, masks are needed. Apart from the fact that goggles can be reused after disinfection, the remaining protective equipment has to be replaced every day.
深一度：中油环保目前每天的清运量是多少？王春山：我们每天都会统计清运数量，上报武汉市环保局和襄阳市环保局，每天大概二三十吨左右，包括武汉市内协助运输的医废和运往襄阳焚烧的医废。
WANG Chunshan: Every day, we report the number of shipments to the Wuhan Environmental Protection Bureau and Xiangyang Environmental Protection Bureau, about 20 or 30 tons a day, including the medical waste in Wuhan that helps transport and the waste that goes to Xiangyang.
最近，省内的危废企业也开始支援武汉医废处理工作，一些生活垃圾发电厂，也承担了部分非发热门诊的医废处理工作，否则全市医废处置还是有难度的。
Recently, waste enterprises in the province also began to support Wuhan waste treatment work, some domestic waste power plants, but also part of the non-heating clinical waste treatment work, otherwise the city's waste disposal is still difficult.
从2月17日开始，武汉主要医院的医疗废物能接近日产日清。
From February 17, Wuhan main hospital medical waste can approach Nissan Nissan Qing.
工人们将医疗废物抬上运输车“上车”前分类难 医废桶紧缺深一度：目前武汉的医废处置有哪些难点？王春山：一般来说“医废上车”之前应该做好分类，但前线的医护人员已经筋疲力尽了，没有时间精力分类。
What are the difficulties in disposing of medical waste in Wuhan at present? Wang Chunshan: Generally speaking, medical staff on the front line are exhausted and do not have time to sort out.
我们所收集运输的医废基本上没怎么分类，直接装到了医废桶里。
The medical waste we collect and transport is basically unsorted and loaded directly into the waste bins.
我们刚来的时候，一些医院医疗废物都是散装的，搬上车之前还需要装桶，增加了一道工序，就增加了一次风险。
When we first arrived, some of the hospital's medical waste was in bulk and needed to be filled with buckets before being taken on board, adding a process that increased the risk once more.
但医院病人那么多，院方也来不及做这些工作。
But the hospital had so many patients that it was too late for the hospital to do the work.
深一度：医废如何分类，不分类有何隐患？王春山：疫情爆发之前医废没有作区分，爆发之后，会按隔离区、红区等区域去做区分。
Deep once: How to classify medical waste, do not classify what hidden dangers? Wang Chunshan: Before the outbreak of the outbreak of medical waste did not make a distinction, after the outbreak, will be divided into zones, red zones and other areas to make a distinction.
每个区域的医废因为感染性不一样，需要单独运走。
Medical waste in each region needs to be transported separately because it is not as infectious.
医疗废物的主要风险存在于焚烧前的那段时间。
The main risk for medical waste is in the period prior to incineration.
卸下车的医废桶放在场地，可能会有人经过或不小心接触感染性强的医疗废物，造成感染。
Discharging the vehicle's waste drums on the site may result in infection through or inadvertent contact with highly infectious medical waste.
但对于最终处置不会有影响，医废的结果都是烧掉。
However, the final disposal will have no impact, the result of waste is burning.
深一度：除了医废分类问题，还有其他困难吗？王春山：处置流程要想做到医废全程“不落地”的话，至少需要医废产出量三倍的医废桶才可以。
Deep once: In addition to the classification of medical waste, there are other difficulties? Wang Chunshan: the disposal process to achieve the entire "do not land", at least the output of waste three times the amount of medical waste can be.
比如，一家医院每天会产生一百桶医废，必须保证有三百个桶可供使用，其中一百个放在医院收集医废，一百个在运输处置途中，一百个卸车之后正在清洗消毒准备再次投入使用。
For example, a hospital will produce 100 barrels of waste every day and must ensure that 300 barrels are available for use. Of these, 100 are collected in hospitals, 100 are in transit for disposal, and 100 are being cleaned and disinfected for reuse.
疫情爆发之后，当地企业用上了所有库存的医废桶，环保部门也进行了捐赠，我们公司带过来一千多个，但还是不够。
After the outbreak, local enterprises used up all the waste barrels in stock, and the environmental authorities made donations. Our company brought over a thousand, but still not enough.
最后只能从当地环保部门调来几百个生活垃圾桶。
Only a few hundred domestic garbage cans can be transferred from the local environmental authorities.
最近，我们让供应商紧急加工，加上库存，又发了三千多个过来，现在光我们公司就投入了五六千个医废桶，但只能说有所缓解。
Recently, we let the supplier emergency processing, plus the stock, more than 3,000 more over, now our company alone put in five or six thousand waste barrels, but can only be said to alleviate.
另外，有的医院还没有完全建设好，但需要迅速启用，场地上还都是施工用房等，我们都是自己请的叉车对现场进行清理，“打通”收集运输医废的通道。
In addition, some hospitals are not yet fully built, but need to be quickly opened, the site is still full of construction, we are the forklift to clean up the site, "open" the collection of transport waste channels.
