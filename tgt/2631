在曾经川流不息的都市中，他们是城市交通最有力的一道保障武汉某医院内病房患者摄：黄孝光至今回想起来，曾洪波仍然觉得不可思议，因为“一天之内要召集成立一个超过1300人的车队”。
In a city that once enjoyed a steady stream of traffic, they were the most powerful way to protect patients in a hospital ward in Wuhan: In retrospect, Mr. Tsang still finds it unbelievable that "a convoy of more than 1,300 people will be assembled in one day."
他还是一头扎了进去。
Still he plunged in.
武汉前线，他把团队搬到了仓库，方便办公。
Wuhan front, he moved the team to the warehouse, convenient office.
后方，滴滴程序员们也在焦灼中加班，研发新的程序。
Behind the scenes, drip programmers are also working overtime, developing new programs.
除夕夜，临时召集起来的保障车队司机们开始上岗。
On New Year's Eve, the drivers of the makeshift convoy are on duty.
这个“不可能的任务”被一家互联网公司完成了。
This "impossible task" was accomplished by an Internet company.
一天完成上千人保障车队组建1月23日武汉“封城”后，公共交通停运，城市被紧急按下了暂停键。
Thousands of people guaranteed convoy formation January 23, Wuhan after the "closure" of public transport, the city was emergency pressed the temporary key.
很快，滴滴在武汉成立了一线指挥部，曾洪波担任指挥部负责人，任命是由滴滴出行创始人兼CEO程维亲自下达的。
Soon, drip in Wuhan set up a first-line command, Zeng Hongbo as the command, appointed by drip travel founder and CEO Cheng Wei personally.
1月24日，武汉市新型肺炎防控指挥部发布第8号通告，全市紧急征集6000台网约车和出租车分配给中心城区，由社区居委会统一调度使用，包括滴滴在内的多家公司参与其中。
On January 24, the Wuhan New Pneumonia Prevention and Control Command issued Notice No. 8, which calls for the urgent collection of 6,000 network buses and taxis to be allocated to the central city area.
一天时间召集1000多名司机，曾洪波的第一反应是“不可能的任务”，但他低估了司机们的热情。
Mr Tsang's first reaction to summoning more than 1,000 drivers a day was an "impossible task," but he underestimated their enthusiasm.
结果是，这些司机都在一天内召集完毕，并完成社区分组。
As a result, the drivers were convoked within a day and the community subgroups were completed.
除夕上午发出召集令后，50多家租赁公司立即给旗下司机发出了报名表。
On the morning of the New Year's Eve, more than 50 leasing companies immediately raised the alarm form for their drivers.
靠着微信群的搭建和合作公司的推荐，到1月25日下午，1000多名司机的招募工作基本完成。
By the afternoon of January 25, the job of recruiting more than 1,000 drivers was almost complete, thanks to the help of the microphone group and the recommendations of the collaborating companies.
杜川就是保障车队中的一员。
Du Chuan is one of the team members.
因为担心疫情，早在1月16日他就把父母和放寒假的女儿送回了黄陂的乡下老家。
Fearing the outbreak, he sent his parents and winter-time daughter back to Huangpi's hometown as early as January 16.
按照原计划，他打算在1月23日收车去和女儿汇合，“封城”打乱了这个男人的团圆计划。
He had planned to stop on January 23 to meet his daughter, and "sealing the city" disrupted the man's plans for reunion.
曾洪波在给武汉滴滴保障车队司机培训除夕上午，看到车队微信群里发布了招募志愿者司机的信息，他立即就报名参加了社区保障车队。
Zeng Hongbo, who was training Wuhan drip-drip convoy drivers on New Year's Eve, immediately signed up to join the community-guaranteed fleet when he saw the motorcade posting information about volunteer drivers.
审核通过后，租赁公司第一时间通知杜川到指定仓库领取防护物资。
After approval of the audit, the leasing company immediately notified Du Chuan to collect the protective materials from the designated warehouse.
在现场，工作人员告诉他所服务的社区地点和上岗时间。
At the site, the staff informs him of the location of the community he serves and the hours of duty.
从志愿者招募到司机进社区，这一流程必须在短时间内完成。
From the recruitment of volunteers to the introduction of drivers into the community, the process must be completed in a short time.
早在除夕前一天，曾洪波和20多名同事就将办公地点搬到了存放物资的仓库。
The day before New Year's Eve, Zeng and more than 20 colleagues moved their offices to a warehouse where goods were stored.
为提高效率，他们短信通知审核通过的司机分批次、分时间段领取防护物资，最高峰时仓库门口停了100多辆车。
To improve efficiency, they sent short messages to vetted and vetted drivers for protection in batches and over time, with more than 100 vehicles parked outside the warehouse at the peak.
在防护物资分发现场，还有10名工作人员负责联系武汉400多个社区的工作人员，与他们确认所需司机的数量。
At the site of the distribution of protective equipment, a further 10 staff members contacted staff in over 400 communities in Wuhan to confirm with them the number of drivers required.
同时，工作人员需要告诉司机需要在什么时间点到社区报到。
At the same time, staff need to inform drivers of the time required to report to the community.
“每一个环节都需要我的同事跟踪和确认。
"Every link needs to be tracked and validated by my colleagues.
”曾洪波告诉记者，司机是否有足够的防护物资，是否在指定时间到达所服务的社区，都与滴滴的服务质量直接挂钩。
Mr Tsang told reporters whether drivers had enough protective equipment and whether they reached the communities they served at the appointed time were directly linked to the quality of drip-drip services.
最终，杜川和另外5位司机，被分配到武汉洪山区和平街徐东社区。
In the end, Du Chuan and five other drivers were assigned to the Xudong community of Heping Street in Hongshan District, Wuhan.
这里一共5个居民小区，16000位居民，老年人多、用车需求大。
There are five residential areas, with 16,000 residents. There are many elderly people and a large demand for cars.
杜川跟女儿约定每晚8点视频聊天，这个时段社区工作相对少一点，他可以忙中偷闲。
He and his daughter set up a video chat at 8: 00 each night, a time when community work is relatively small and he can take time off.
采访当天，正是他5岁女儿的生日。
It was his five-year-old daughter's birthday on the day of the interview.
母亲用水果拼盘给孙女做了生日蛋糕，同时给杜川发来图片。
Mother made a birthday cake for her granddaughter with a fruit platter and sent a picture to Du Chuan.
“心里很不是滋味，感觉自己没能给女儿好好过个生日。
"I felt bad about it and didn't feel like I had a good birthday for my daughter.
”他想等疫情过去了，再给女儿补过。
He wanted to make it up for his daughter when the outbreak was over.
滴滴保障车队司机工作时自拍作为武汉抗疫一线指挥部负责人，曾洪波表示，最初的七天七夜是最艰难的。
"The first seven days and seven nights were the most difficult," said Zeng Hongbo, head of Wuhan's first-line anti-epidemic headquarters.
“时间紧、任务重，需要考虑的细节也多，从招募司机、分发物资再到安排司机下社区，这三个环节的工作环环相扣，几乎是同步展开的。
"Time is running out, the task is heavy and the details need to be considered - from recruiting drivers and distributing supplies to getting drivers into the community - are all linked, almost simultaneously.
”据曾洪波介绍，截至目前平均每个社区能有两到三名滴滴司机。
"So far, an average of two to three drip-drip drivers have been found in every community, Zeng said.
但在疫情爆发初期，公司和社区工作人员都没有太多经验，对于社区所需车辆无法准确估算。
However, in the early stages of the outbreak, companies and community workers had little experience and were unable to estimate accurately the vehicles required by the community.
最多的时候，有的社区7台滴滴保障车辆同时待命，在一定程度上是资源浪费。
Most of the time, some communities 7 drip guarantee vehicles at the same time stand by, in part a waste of resources.
“在1月27日到30日期间，一直在做调整。
"Between January 27 and January 30, adjustments were made.
将社区多余的车辆召回，再将这些车辆分配到需求量大的社区。
Community surplus vehicles are recalled and redistributed to communities in high need.
”曾洪波表示。
Mr Tsang said.
医护车队除夕夜上线比社区保障车队更早组建的滴滴医护车队，除夕夜当晚就已经在前线奔波。
On New Year's Eve, a drip-drip medical convoy set up earlier than the Community Protection Unit was already on the frontline on New Year's Eve.
武汉“封城”后，严格的交通管制让大量医务工作者上下班成了难题。
Wuhan "closure", strict traffic control so that a large number of medical workers to work has become a problem.
有人骑单车或步行上班，有人甚至需要凌晨四点徒步向医院进发。
Some people ride bicycles or walk to work, and some even have to walk to the hospital at 4am.
同时，滴滴出行的客服热线也收到很多咨询电话，询问App是否还能够使用，能否叫到车。
At the same time, the drop-by-drop customer service hotline received many calls asking if the App was still available and whether it could be reached.
来自司机端和社交平台的信息都显示，“封城”后医务人员必要的出行难以保证。
Messages from motorists and social platforms alike indicate that the necessary travel of medical staff after the "closure" is difficult to ensure.
1月24日，滴滴武汉分公司客服团队经理胡维维在信息搜集过程中检测到14个医务人员求助贴，用车情况紧急。
January 24, drip Wuhan Branch customer service team manager Hu Weiwei in the information-gathering process detected 14 medical staff help posts, the use of vehicles emergency.
下午1点30分，他把情况反馈给滴滴客服部门负责人刘西帝，随后滴滴内部开始商讨专门接送医务人员的车队方案。
At 1: 30 p.m., he reported back to Mr. Liu, head of the drip-drip customer service department, and internal discussions began on a convoy programme for medical personnel.
武汉某医院护士正在工作摄：黄孝光4个小时后，胡维维收到了更细化的指令——对接到医院、对接司机。
Wuhan Hospital Nurse Work Photo: Four hours after Huang Xiaoguang, Hu received more detailed instructions - to the hospital, docking the driver.
让他记忆犹新的是，在收到指令后马上就有10余位司机自愿报名到岗。
Still fresh in his mind were more than 10 drivers who volunteered to be on duty as soon as they received their orders.
当晚，包括胡维维在内的22名员工负责对接医院。
That night, 22 employees, including Hoovey, docked the hospital.
没有官方的对接渠道，胡维维和团队只能在网上搜索信息。
Without an official docking channel, the team had to search the Internet for information.
对于从媒体渠道和客服渠道发出过需求的医护人员，他和同事会反向找到该医护人员所在的医院，形成需求对接，再通过微信群把医护人员的出行信息收集起来，以便调配车辆。
For medical staff who have expressed a need from media outlets and customer service channels, he and his colleagues will find the hospital where the medical staff are located in reverse and form a demand-docking facility. They will then collect the travel information of the medical staff through a microphone group so that vehicles can be deployed.
此时，除夕深夜，首批100名医护保障车队的司机也已经全部到岗。
By this time, late at night, the first 100 drivers of the Medicare convoy had arrived.
湖北人刘邱斌就是其中一员，当晚姑姑给他打了好几个电话，都被他拒接了。
Liu Qiubin, a Hubei resident, was one of them, and his aunt made several phone calls to him that night, which he refused to accept.
当时，这个31岁的湖北汉子正和其它99名滴滴网约车司机一起，接受武汉“医护保障车队”的防护培训。
The 31-year-old Hubei was among 99 drip-drip drivers who were given protection training by Wuhan's "medical support team."
1月25日凌晨，第一个医护订单产生，来自华中科技大学附属协和医院，通过这笔订单，胡维维团队对接上了武汉协和医院。
In the early morning of January 25, the first medical care order came from Concorde Hospital, an affiliate of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
“靠着核心医护人员的传播，是能够最快把有需求的医护人员聚集起来的方法。
"Relying on the spread of core health care workers is the fastest way to bring together those in need.
”胡维维说。
'he said.
第二种方法则是找到医院总台对接。
The second method is to find the hospital terminal docking.
同一天，他和3名同事对接了武汉三家大型医院，按照科室划分，建立微信建群。
On the same day, he and three colleagues docked three large Wuhan hospitals, according to the division of departments, set up a micro-letter group.
直到凌晨两点，他们才将当天的信息收录完毕。
It was not until two o'clock in the morning that they finished recording the day's information.
由于向公司提出的是紧急申请，起初司机的物资、车辆通行、人员调配，都需要人工完成，在微信群提交需求后分配司机。
As a result of the urgent request to the company, the driver's materials, vehicles, deployment of personnel, all need to be done manually, after the micro-groups submit the needs of the distribution of drivers.
当微信群达到6个时，曾洪波发现，无论调度车辆还是统计医护人员的信息，都已经超出人工作业的承受负荷。
When the micro-group reached 6, Zeng Hong-po found that no matter dispatching vehicles or statistics medical personnel, has exceeded the carrying capacity of manual work.
胡维维说，1月26日中午12点之前，光是他对接的武汉协和医院就有133位医护人员提出接送需求。
Before 12: 00 noon on January 26, 133 medical personnel from Wuhan Concorde Hospital, where he docked, demanded transport, he said.
团队核对所有需求，再发给车队负责人，整个流程下来，同事们每天要工作到零点后才能结束。
The team checked all the requirements and sent them to the team leader, who worked until midnight every day.
与此同时，滴滴的程序员们正在加班加点研发，耗时31小时，滴滴出行武汉抗疫调度项目的线上系统紧急启用。
Meanwhile, drip-drip programmers are working overtime, taking 31 hours to deploy online systems for a drip-drip epidemic control project in Wuhan.
这是技术工程师团队紧急开发的仅供医护人员线上叫车的功能，录入一线医护人员的手机号，他们就可以在滴滴出行App上发起订单，再由司机抢单接送。
This is an emergency developed by the team of technical engineers for medical personnel only on-line call function, enter the mobile phone number of the first-line health-care personnel, they can start the order on the App drip, and the driver can pick it up.
接送医护人员的费用均为0。
The cost of transporting medical personnel is zero.
这意味着，所有的费用都是滴滴来承担。
This means that all costs are borne by dribs and drabs.
10万司机与23680名医务人员在“医护车队”司机黄飞的手机上，仅2月以来的十一天，他的“0元”订单总数就达到了154个。
On the mobile phone of medical motorcade driver Huang Fei, 100000 drivers and 23,680 medical staff have placed orders worth 154 yuan in the 11 days since February alone.
新型冠状病毒到底有多可怕？刚报名参加滴滴医护专车的时候黄飞没有概念。
How terrible is the new coronavirus? Huangfei had no idea when he signed up for the drip-drop medical van.
直到每天在路上看不到车辆和行人，车速可以飙到120迈时，他心里害怕了。
He was frightened until he could see no traffic or pedestrians on the road every day and could zip over 120 feet.
“安静得让人心里发毛”，黄飞形容，“除了成群结队的流浪狗还有鸟，大街上很难看到人群。
"It's so quiet," Huang describes, "except for hordes of stray dogs and birds. It's hard to see crowds on the streets.
”2月12日，黄飞早上6点就出门了。
"Huang Fei went out at 6 a.m. on February 12.
前一晚，他抢到了6点40分出门的医护人员的订单。
The night before, he had grabbed an order from the paramedics who had left the house at 6: 40.
他需要提前把车里消毒水的味道散一散，再为自己穿好防护装备出发，以确保能准点将那位医生送到医院。
He needed to scatter the smell of disinfectant in the car ahead of time and set out with his protective gear to make sure the doctor was delivered to the hospital on time.
正在接送医护人员的医护专车司机一单结束后，黄飞都得给车座消毒。
Huang Feifei had to disinfect the seat of a hospital van that was carrying medical staff.
一天十几单，黄飞的喉咙和眼睛被消毒水呛得难受，“不能闻刺激性气味，连眼睛都会难受。
More than a dozen a day, Huang Fei's throat and eyes choke with disinfectant water, "can not smell pungent smell, even the eyes will suffer.
”一位医生告诉他，84消毒液配比过重，会对眼睛和喉咙产生这种刺激性效果，但比例不够又达不到消毒效果。
A doctor told him that a disproportionately heavy disinfectant mix could have such irritating effects on the eyes and throat, but not in proportion to the effect of disinfection.
大多时候，呛人的感觉会在下车透气10分钟后有缓解。
Most of the time, the choking sensation will subside after 10 minutes of getting out of the car.
黄飞忍了，他宁愿喉咙和眼睛难受一点，也要确保达到消毒效果。
Huang Feifei endure, he would rather throat and eye afflictive, also want to make sure achieve disinfection effect.
每晚收工后，黄飞还要用84消毒液把车里整体消毒一遍，再把自己从上到下喷一遍消毒水，脱下防护服放在车里晾一晚上，第二天接着穿。
At the end of each night, Huang Fei disinfected the car with disinfectant 84 and sprayed himself with disinfectant from top to bottom. He took off his suit and left it in the car to dry overnight.
为了让消毒水的气味小一点，黄飞早上得提前打开车门通风10分钟，这样上早班的人就不会觉得刺鼻了。
In order to make the disinfectant smell less, Huang Fei had to open the door early in the morning for 10 minutes, so that morning shift people would not feel sharp.
防护装备是从滴滴武汉疫情指挥中心领取的，前期物资的还是有些紧俏。
The protective equipment is from the drip Wuhan epidemic command center to receive, the initial material is still a little tight.
滴滴在后方为一线司机四处求援，总裁柳青也在微博上发出抗疫物资求助帖。
Drops in the rear for the first-line drivers around for help, president Liu Qing also issued Weibo anti-epidemic material help post.
除了这些防护设备的保障，滴滴还为2019年12月15日至疫情结束期间所有完成线上订单的司机提供专项肺炎险。
In addition to these safeguards, the drip provides dedicated pneumonia insurance for all drivers who have completed their online orders between 15 December 2019 and the end of the epidemic.
刘邱斌爱做饭，往年家里的年夜饭都是他主厨，唯独今年，他缺席了。
Liu Qiubin loves to cook, in previous years the family dinner is his chef, only this year, he was absent.
得知刘邱斌加入了医疗保障车队，姑姑的第一反应是，让刘邱斌把她的儿子也带上，表兄弟俩一般大，姑姑很豪爽：“每天在家睡觉干嘛？出去做点有用的事！”遗憾的是，滴滴医护车队面向在滴滴平台注册的网约车司机招募，表弟没能成行。
Liu Qiubin joined the medical care team, the aunt's first reaction was to let Liu Qiupin take her son, the same size as her cousins, very generous: "What do you sleep at home every day? Go out and do something useful!
事实上，刘邱斌也是三个月前才从服装生意转行网约车的，原本看中的是工作时间灵活，没想到现在竟然连春节都在工作。
In fact, Liu Qiubin only three months ago from the clothing business to the network contract car, the original focus is flexible working hours, I did not expect that even now the Spring Festival is working.
非常时期，这位刚刚转型的网约车司机被一个个细微的瞬间震撼着。
Unusual period, this just transition net contract car driver is shocked by one minute each minute.
分配任务的群里，师傅们抢着接单，有师傅说：“晚上的单子，不管多晚，都可以找我。
In the midst of the task, the master pressed for orders, and a master said, Whatever the night, you may come to me.
”有年长些的师傅生怕自己被“照顾”，再三表示：“别看我岁数大，我身体好着呢！”大年初一早上的第一个任务，被刘邱斌抢到了。
The older teachers, fearing that they would be taken care of, kept saying, "Although I am old, I am well." Liu Qiubin grabbed the first task on the first morning of the New Year.
他有些激动，也有一点点发怵，穿上黄色的防护服，拉链拉到下巴，口罩结结实实地遮住半张脸，出发了。
He was a little excited, a little bit nervous, wearing a yellow suit, zipper to chin, mask solidly covering half his face, and set off.
对这份工作，他已经形成了朴素的自豪感：“虽然我们只是在跑车，但是我们接送的人在做有意义的事，我们做的事也有意义。
He has developed a simple sense of pride in the job: "Although we're just in the sports car, we're doing something meaningful and what we're doing makes sense.
”正是靠黄飞、刘邱斌等这样的滴滴司机，自除夕夜至2月25日，滴滴医护车队已在武汉、上海、北京、厦门、宁波、南京等14个城市投入服务，累计收到全国近10万名司机的主动申请，免费接送23680名医务工作者。
It is by dripping drivers such as Huang Fei and Liu Qiubin that drip-drop medical convoys have been put into service in 14 cities, including Wuhan, Shanghai, Beijing, Xiamen, Ningbo and Nanjing, from New Year's Eve to February 25.
为此，滴滴也设立两亿元的保障车队专项资金，用于这些车队司机津贴、保障和采购防疫物资等。
To this end, Ditto also set up a dedicated $200 million convoy protection fund for the drivers of these convoys to subsidize, safeguard and procure epidemic prevention materials.
更安全的防护企业社会责任和司机们的热情共同保障了车轮上的武汉可以正常运转，但安全是第一道道防线。
Safer defense of corporate social responsibility and driver enthusiasm to ensure that the wheels of Wuhan can be normal operation, but security is the first line of defense.
出车时，公司要求司机必须戴口罩、上报体温、车内勤消毒，同时还在进一步探索安全保障措施。
Drivers are required to wear masks, report body temperature and disinfect their vehicles while safety measures are being further explored.
最近，刘邱斌的车上又多了一道防护膜。
Recently, Liu Qiubin's car also has an additional protective film.
这是用塑料薄膜及胶带等工具，将车内前后排分隔开，形成一个简易的“安全舱”。
This is a plastic film and tape and other tools, the car inside the front and back separated into a simple "safe cabin."
“这对我们或者乘客，都是一直比较好的保护，会让大家心理上更安心点。
"This is for us or passengers, are always better protection, will let everyone more psychological peace of mind.
”他说。
'he said.
北京滴滴网约车防护膜上贴有“北京加油”字样的手绘画防护膜措施的出炉，经过了滴滴的多方考虑与讨论：疫情之下，怎么才能让广大司机和乘客更放心，更安全？2月初，滴滴内部展开多轮探讨，在向专业人士咨询隔离膜的防护效果同时，总部也要求防护膜的方案发到医护人员的微信群，希望他们能给出更专业的建议。
After much deliberation and discussion on how to make the drivers and passengers feel safer and safer under the epidemic situation, the head office also asked the medical staff to send the protective film to the medical staff for more professional advice.
胡维维记得，发到几个医护群后，95%的医护人员建议安装，少部分人觉得只要司机和乘客做好自身防护，隔离膜的防护作用不大。
After reaching several groups, 95 percent of health-care workers advised installation, with a small number believing the barrier would be less effective as long as drivers and passengers were well protected, he said.
综合各方意见，滴滴陆续在武汉等地的网约车内加装前后排防护隔离膜。
Comprehensive views of all parties, drip after drop in Wuhan and other places in the network of cars equipped with front and rear protective barrier film.
在医护人员等专业人士看来，这类似于一个简易的车内“安全舱”，可以在很大程度上防止飞沫传播。
For professionals such as health professionals, this is akin to a simple in-car "safe cabin," which largely prevents droplets from spreading.
随后，滴滴又将防护膜推向了全国，计划投入总额1亿元专项资金，先期投入3000万元，为全国数百万在疫情期间提供服务的滴滴网约车统一安装、更换塑料防护膜。
Subsequently, drip drop to the national protection film, a total of 100 million yuan dedicated funds, the initial investment of 30 million yuan for the millions of services during the epidemic during the drip network uniform installation, replacement of plastic film.
北京滴滴网约车内安装的防护膜黄海豹是滴滴出行武汉物资补给车队的队长，他和另外10名补给队员的车上每天都装满了防护物资和消毒用品，他们的任务是随时给滴滴司机做补给。
The yellow seal, installed in the drip-drip netting car in Beijing, is the leader of the drip-dripping Wuhan replenishment convoy. He and 10 other supply crews are packed daily with protective and disinfectant supplies and are tasked with resupplying drip-drip drivers at any time.
从2月16日开始，物资车队的车上多了一样；塑料防护膜，同时他们还要负责安装。
Starting on 16 February, the convoy was loaded with the same number of vehicles; plastic sheeting, while they were also responsible for installation.
“一台车需要5分钟，每人每天能装20台车，本周内1336台车都可以完成安装。
"A car takes five minutes, 20 cars per person per day, and 1,336 cars could be installed this week.
”黄海豹表示。
"said the yellow seal.
安装工作开始的前一天，黄海豹会将塑料隔离膜对半裁剪，以便提高安装效率，节省司机时间。
The day before the installation began, the yellow seal paired off the plastic to cut it in half to improve installation efficiency and save driver time.
安装过程并非一帆风顺。
The installation process was not smooth.
“在第一次安装时也出现过一些小问题。
"There were minor problems with the first installation.
”黄海豹告诉记者，一开始使用的安装粘合剂主要是双面胶，但部分司机反映双面胶粘性不够，不到一天隔离膜就脱落了。
The yellow seal told reporters the adhesive was first installed mainly with double-sided glue, but some drivers said the glue was not sticky enough to break off in less than a day.
黄海豹和其他队长商量后采购了一批订书针，“订书针抓力更好，对车辆顶部的伤害也比较小。
Huang seal and other team leaders after consulting a number of staples, "stapler grip is better, damage to the top of the vehicle is also relatively small.
”他说。
'he said.
除了安全，疫情冲击下，很多行业陷入困境，网约车也不例外。
In addition to safety, under the impact of the epidemic, many industries in trouble, including the network car.
刘邱斌是从租赁公司租车来跑网约车的，每个月需要按时还车租。
Liu Qiubin from the rental company to run the car contract, every month need to pay the rental on time.
在全国范围内，像黄飞这样的司机不在少数，在疫情的影响下，订单下滑收入减少，摆在他们面前的难题就是车辆租金怎么办？滴滴也在思考同样的问题。
There are a lot of drivers like Huang Fei all over the country, with orders dropping and revenue dropping, and the question before them is what to do with car rentals.
为缓解司机们的压力，2月15日，倡议在全国范围内为在租车辆顺延一个月租金，司机暂停缴纳2020年2月份租金，车辆租期相应顺延一个月。
To ease the pressure on drivers, on 15 February the initiative was to extend the rental of vehicles for one month throughout the country, with drivers suspending their payments for the month of February 2020 and the rental of vehicles for a corresponding one-month period.
每天，刘邱斌仍然开着车疾驰在武汉空荡的大街上，免费服务着一单又一单的医务人员。
Every day, Liu Qiubin is still driving at a gallop in Wuhan's empty streets, free of charge of a single medical staff.
他说，“武汉的春天最美，因为春暖花开，打开车窗就可以闻得到花香。
"Wuhan is the most beautiful spring," he said, "because spring blooms and windows can smell the flowers.
