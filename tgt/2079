呼吁大家，为了我们这个历经磨难的国家，为了我们这群保家卫国的无名氏，为了在一线奋斗的各个方面的人们，再安心宅在家里一段时间吧，这样之前的付出才有意义！口述| 亚　楠（化名）整理 | 陈　冰我和老公都是湖北仙桃人。
For the sake of our troubled country, our Anonymous guardians of our country, and for the sake of all those who struggle in the field, stay at home for a while longer, so that the previous effort will make sense!
平常我在武汉，老公在仙桃西流河镇上班。
Usually I am in Wuhan, my husband works in Xiliu Town, Xiantao.
两地间隔不远，也就一百来公里。
The distance between the two places is not far, about a hundred kilometers.
1月19日，我带着8个月大的双胞胎女儿从武汉回到仙桃农村婆婆家。
On January 19, I returned to my mother-in-law's home in Xiantao from Wuhan with my 8-month-old twin daughter.
1月23日，武汉下令封城，还来不及反应，我老公的领导就打电话过来了，取消春节假期，随时在岗。
January 23, Wuhan ordered the closure of the city, too late to respond, my husband's leadership called over, canceled the Spring Festival, at any time in the post.
我们这时才意识到事情的严重性。
It was then that we realized the seriousness of the matter.
仙桃西流河镇上的好多路都封了，现在开始集中采购生活用品，分发到户一线的基层干部蹲守在道口，晚上就睡在帐篷里全家人都在咳嗽更糟糕的是，回来的第二天（1月20日），我开始高烧、咳嗽、浑身无力。
Many roads in Xiliu Township are closed, and now I concentrate on buying supplies, basic cadres who are delivered to the front line are crouching at the crossroads, sleeping in tents at night and coughing. To make matters worse, the day after my return (January 20), I began to have a high fever, cough and weakness.
我害怕极了，到乡镇医院要求检查是不是新冠肺炎。
I was so scared that I went to the township hospital and asked if it was New Crown Pneumonia.
但当时整个湖北都是乱的，特别是乡镇这块，根本就没有重视起来，也没有核酸检测，医生说他们也没办法。
But then the whole of Hubei is chaotic, especially the township, there is no attention at all, nor nucleic acid testing, doctors said they can not do.
后来在我的强烈要求下，医院给我拍了胸片，还验了血，确认我不是新冠肺炎，吊着的一颗心才终于放下来。
Later in my strong request, the hospital for me to take a chest film, blood tests, to confirm that I am not the new crown pneumonia, hanging a heart finally let down.
我病了4天以后，接着孩子又开始生病。
I was ill for four days, and then the child began to fall ill again.
8个月大的双胞胎女儿先后开始咳嗽，二宝还有过敏性哮喘，感觉每一天都如履薄冰，简直是熬身又熬心。
The eight-month-old twin daughters began coughing, Erbao and allergic asthma, feeling like walking on thin ice every day, it was hard work and hard work.
终于，孩子不咳嗽了，天气转晴了，婆婆又开始咳嗽了……老公去一线照顾隔离病人老公隔离期满了，领导让他上一线。
Finally, the child did not cough, the weather turned fine, mother-in-law began to cough... Husband to the first line of care isolated patient husband isolation expired, the leadership let him on the line.
我一直以为他去办公室搞统计工作的。
I always thought he went to the office for statistics.
2月1日，他走的那天，我因为孩子的问题，都没给他个好脸色，也没好好抱他一下，没有跟他说一声“加油”……没想到，老公一去就接到了上一线照顾隔离病人的通知。
Feb. 1, the day he left, I did not give him a good face because of the child's problems, did not give him a good hug, did not say "refuel" to him...
老公是个退伍军人，一直有点英雄主义，做事雷厉风行的。
Husband is a veteran, has been a little heroic, do things quickly.
接到通知，他马上就赶到了隔离点。
He arrived at the quarantine point at short notice.
老公只能抽空和双胞胎女儿视频通话，虽然她们还不会说话第一天视频，老公告诉我那里条件可以，单人宿舍，饭菜有鱼有肉有青菜，就是早上只有泡面，也不用担心和病人接触，基本没有被感染的风险。
My husband told me that the conditions were fine there. The single room, the food was fish and meat with vegetables, there was no need to worry about contact with the patient, and there was little risk of infection.
第二天视频，老公没接，晚上回视频说去给隔离点的房间消毒了！我心想，不是说了不接触病人的吗？怎么还去消毒？第三天视频，依然没接。
The next day video, my husband did not answer the video back at night to the isolation point to disinfect the room! I thought, did not say do not touch the patient? How to disinfect? The third day video, still did not answer.
晚上回来电话说接到消息，明天要来好几个隔离的人，要开始搭帐篷了。
Call back in the evening and say we've got word that there will be a few quarantined people tomorrow, and we're going to set up a tent.
一直以为是给隔离的人搭帐篷，没想到第四天给我发了一段视频说，他要开始在帐篷里睡觉了，我瞬间泪如雨下……帐篷里的设施一开始比较简陋目前老公住的帐篷，条件好多了农村基层工作不好做农村的基层工作不好做，临时辟出来的镇政府和卫生院作为隔离点，设施简陋，现在隔离了30多个人员，老公负责协调他们的吃住问题。
On the fourth day I was sent a video saying that he was going to sleep in a tent... The tent facilities started out to be very modest... The tent facilities were much better... The rural grass-roots work was not easy.
西流河镇集中隔离医学观察点，工作人员在消毒前几天，援建雷神山的人回来了，镇政府需要他们居家隔离，但是村里不同意，没办法，他们也被送到了我老公所在的隔离点了。
Xiliuhe Town concentrated medical observation points, staff in the days before disinfection, to help the construction of Lei Shenshan people back, the township government needed them to be isolated at home, but the village did not agree, no way, they were also sent to my husband's isolation point.
说来凑巧，有几个人还都是我家亲戚。
It so happens that a few of them are relatives of mine.
老公每天遇到的挑战也很大——有一家，姐姐新冠肺炎去世了，弟弟在隔离点没几天自己也出现了胸闷气短的症状，被送到医院了。
Husband's daily challenges are also very big - one, sister died of pneumonia, younger brother in isolation within a few days of their own chest shortness symptoms, was sent to the hospital.
前几天，核酸检测又查出来4个……当然，也有不少暖心时刻——有个五岁的小孩因为很感激我老公他们的照顾，画画送给他们。
A few days ago, nucleic acid tests found 4 more... of course, there were some warm moments - a five-year-old boy who was grateful for my husband's care and drew pictures for them.
风大的日子，帐篷都被刮倒了虽然立春了，湖北还下着绵绵细雨，气温时低时高，这样的天气最容易感冒，我不知道说什么好，只能不停地跟老公说注意安全，注意保暖，注意消毒——手机消毒，手消毒，衣服消毒，除了这些我还能说什么呢？我们这边的政府还是很负责任的，整个乡镇控制的情况还是比较好的。
I don't know what to say. I can only keep telling my husband about the safety, warmth and disinfection - mobile phone disinfection, hand disinfection, clothes disinfection, but my side of the government is very responsible, the whole township control situation is relatively good.
盼望老公下个月健康回来过30岁生日老公离开的第五天，大宝又有点咳嗽了，一晚上都在闹腾，我整夜整夜没法睡觉，忍着不给他打电话，我知道老公也无能为力。
On the fifth day after his husband left, Dabao coughed a little and was having a noisy night. I couldn't sleep all night. I couldn't help calling him.
我只能网上问医生。
I can only ask the doctor online.
幸好老公早早地囤了一些药在家里，我一直是个乐观积极的人，可是现在，夜深人静的时候，我真的很恐惧，害怕孩子生病，害怕老公被传染。
Fortunately, my husband early in some medicine at home, I have been an optimistic positive person, but now, in the dead of night, I really fear, afraid of children sick, fear of her husband infected.
思绪万千……想到跟老公认识、恋爱、结婚到现在有孩子，他一直是一个对工作兢兢业业的人。
Saussure... he has always been a hard worker, thinking about meeting, falling in love with, getting married and having children.
无论在哪个岗位，都能很好地完成各项任务，家里各种表扬证书一大堆。
No matter in which position, can perform the task well, the family various praise certificate pile.
但是说我心里没有怨气是假的。
But to say that I have no grudge in my heart is false.
跟老公结婚的时候，他没休婚假就返岗了。
When he married his husband, he returned to work without taking his wedding leave.
好不容易等到十一放假，和他出去旅游，第三天游西湖的时候，他接到紧急电话连夜赶回了工作岗位。
After a holiday in November and a trip to the West Lake on the third day, he got an emergency call and rushed back to work.
去年怀孕到晚期的时候，因为双胎宝宝胎心不稳，我身体的凝血功能不好，随时有血栓的风险，医生建议赶紧剖腹产。
Late last year, because the twin baby fetal heart instability, my body clotting function is not good, at any time there is a risk of thrombosis, the doctor recommends hastening Caesarean section.
老公在我要生孩子的头一天才到我身边，第二天生完孩子，宝宝们被送进温箱，我还来不及看一眼，他又赶着回去做扶贫工作。
My husband didn't come to me until the day before I was due to have a baby. He gave birth the next day. The babies were put in the incubator.
然而，此时此刻，看着老公发过来的视频，真的心疼加担心。
However, at this moment, looking at my husband sent the video, really heartache and worry.
再多的抱怨化为乌有——只要你平平安安，早点回家。
No amount of complaining will go away if you come home safe and sound.
我们已经有1个多月没见面了，虽然你工作的地方离我们不过20分钟的车程。
We haven't seen each other in more than a month, even though you're only 20 minutes away from where we're working.
呼吁大家，停下你们躁动不安的心，停下你们无处安放的脚，为了我们这个历经磨难的国家，为了我们这群保家卫国的无名氏，为了在一线奋斗的各个方面的人们，再安心宅在家里一段时间吧，这样他们的付出才有意义！老公下个月30岁生日，他曾答应我要回来一起过的，一家四口‍‍‍欢聚一堂。
I call upon you to stop your restless heart, stop your feet where you have nowhere to put them, for the sake of our troubled country, the anonymous guardians of our country, and the people of all walks of life, so that their efforts can make sense! My husband's 30th birthday next month, he promised to come back together, the family of four young people.
