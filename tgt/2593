Corrado Clini, Italy's former environment minister, told Caijing that the 2003 SARS epidemic should have produced a global, permanent, WHO-backed research program to combat the virus, but it did not; nor did it have an effective global infectious-disease surveillance and control system, which took everyone by surprise.
