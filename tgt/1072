今年53岁的胡安平是湖北黄冈人，在黄冈菜市场内经营家禽生意。

去年12月底，他被确诊为新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎重症患者，住进了武汉大学中南医院的重症监护室。
At the end of December, he was admitted to the intensive care unit of Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital.
1月28日，他正式出院。
On 28 January, he was officially discharged from hospital.
此前的报道称，他是武汉疫情中第一位出院的重症患者。
Earlier reports said he was the first serious patient to be discharged from the Wuhan epidemic.
如今，胡安平还在武汉一家宾馆里自行隔离。

他不出门，每天呆在宾馆里刷新闻，最关心疫情的进展。

儿子给他买了面包、饼干、方便面，妻子一个人留守在黄冈的家中，每天和胡安平通三个电话，互相报平安。

“等武汉解除封城，我马上回黄冈，现在就想和妻子好好说说话。
"When Wuhan is lifted, I will go back to Huanggang. I want to talk to my wife now.
”胡安平说。
"said Hu.
━━━━━进重症监护室之前，两天两夜没敢睡觉新京报：什么时候出现症状的?胡安平：2019年12月底，我出现了感冒的症状，全身发冷，在家要盖三床被子。
2008-12-12 00: 00 In the intensive care unit, two days and two nights before going to bed New Beijing News When did symptoms appear? Hu Anping: At the end of December 2019, I had a cold all over my body and had to build three quilts at home.
因为平时我的身体素质不错，只是有点高血压。
Because usually my physical quality is good, just a little high blood pressure.
当时我还在忙家里的事，没有马上去医院。
I was busy at home and didn't go to the hospital right away.
拖了几天越来越不舒服，我才去黄冈中心医院。
After days of uneasiness, I went to Huanggang Central Hospital.
当时照了CT，已经是肺炎了，右肺出现了阴影，当天就住院了。
The CT scan showed pneumonia, a shadow appeared in the right lung, and he was hospitalized the same day.
在医院打了两天针，第三天再去拍片子，左肺也感染了。
After two days of injections in the hospital, I went for a third day and my left lung was infected.
主治医生把我妻子叫过去，说我的情况有点严重，准备下“病重通知书”了，让家属签字。
The attending doctor called my wife over and said that I was in a serious condition and was ready to give the family a "sick notice" to sign.
我妻子当时很紧张，因为几年前我家有个亲戚就是因为连续高烧不退，导致肾衰竭。
My wife was nervous because a relative in my family had a high fever a few years ago, which led to kidney failure.
所以我们商量转到武汉治病，1月5日下午四点多，中心医院联系救护车，把我拉到武汉中南医院。
So we discussed the transfer to Wuhan for treatment, January 5 more than 4 p.m., the central hospital contact ambulance, pulled me to Wuhan Zhongnan Hospital.
新京报：在武汉医院检查的情况怎么样?胡安平：我到武汉的时候，武汉的几所大医院已经都住满了患者。
The Beijing News: How was the inspection in Wuhan? HUANping: When I arrived in Wuhan, several major hospitals in Wuhan were already full of patients.
中南医院里也有很多病患了。
There are a lot of patients in the south-central hospital.
其实在我到武汉之前，知道华南海鲜市场已经封了，有人感染了，我在黄冈经营家禽生意。
In fact, before I arrived in Wuhan, I knew that the South China Seafood Market had been closed.
虽然没亲自去过华南海鲜市场，但市场里的海鲜大多是从华南进货。
Although I haven't been to the South China Seafood Market myself, most of the seafood in the market comes from South China.
也不知道我是怎么被传染的。
I don't know how I got infected.
当时并不知道这个病是什么，只知道会影响肺部。
What the disease was was unknown at the time, except that it affected the lungs.
转到武汉之后，也是按照肺炎诊断治疗的。
After the transfer to Wuhan, is also in accordance with the diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia.
后来医生才告诉我，我得的就是“新型冠状肺炎”，我是最早一批发病的人，当时还不知道该如何治疗，也不知道该用什么药。
Then the doctors told me that I was going to have "new coronary pneumonia." I was one of the first people to get sick and didn't know how to treat it or what to take.
1月6日，医生开始为我检查，抽血、拍了CT，那时候我的两个肺已经都发白了，医生说还好我来得及时，再拖两天就拖成“死肺”了。
On January 6, doctors began examining me, taking blood and taking a CT scan. By that time my lungs had turned white. The doctor said I was in time to drag them into "dead lungs" for another two days.
十几个医生诊断，看过片子，说我的肺部已经形成了“白肺”，左右肺上都有阴影，很严重。

我当时呼吸困难，高烧到39摄氏度。
I had difficulty breathing and had a fever of 39 degrees Celsius.
1月7日，我就住进了重症监护室。
On Jan. 7, I was in intensive care.
进重症监护室之前，我几乎两天两夜没有睡觉。
I didn't sleep for almost two days and two nights before I went to intensive care.
不敢睡，怕睡过去就醒不过来了。
Dare not sleep, afraid to sleep over can not wake up.
办完手续进病房的时候，我的头脑还是清醒的。
I was wide-headed when I finished the formalities and entered the ward.
家人都在身边鼓励我，说不管花多少钱都会给我治病，一定会等着我。
My family are around to encourage me, no matter how much money will give me a cure, will certainly wait for me.
新京报：在重症监护室是怎么治疗的?胡安平：家人从医院外面托人给我买了进口药，一组有5瓶，每瓶700元，每天都要用一组，一天就3500元。
How is it treated in the intensive care unit? Hu Anping: My family has asked me to buy some imported medicine from outside the hospital. One group has five bottles, each worth 700 yuan per bottle.
之后又打了三组另一种进口药，又花了不到两万。
Three additional groups of imported drugs were then administered, at a cost of less than 20,000 dollars.
消炎针水从早吊到晚，几乎没有断过。
The anti-inflammatory needle hung from morning till night, almost without interruption.
我在重症监护室住了三天才有点知觉，还是觉得冷。
I was in the intensive care unit for three days before I felt anything but cold.
护士来看我，我戴着呼吸机没法说话，只能用手指示意，让她给我多加了床被子。
When the nurse came to see me, I could not speak with my breathing machine, so I motioned with my finger that she would add an extra quilt to my bed.
家人们每天都来看我，买了面和饺子。
My family came to see me every day and bought noodles and dumplings.
但他们不能进病房，吃的用的都是护士传进来。
But they could not get into the ward, and all the food was brought in by nurses.
医生嘱咐我必须强行吃东西，得了这种病最明显的感觉是口苦、四肢无力。
The doctor told me that I had to force something to eat. The most obvious feeling of the disease was that it was bitter and limp.
那天吃饭，我连一个饺子都拿不起来，只能让护士喂饭。
At dinner that day, I could not even hold up a dumpling, so I had to feed the nurse.
当时我还担心，会不会从此就要残废了。
At the time, I was worried that I would be disabled from then on.
━━━━━“医生说我是第二次新生”新京报：治疗效果怎么样?胡安平：比较幸运的是治疗方案对我很管用。
The doctor says I am a second birth How is the treatment going? Hu Anping: Fortunately, the treatment works for me.
我恢复得挺好，第四天的时候，医生把呼吸机撤了，让我自己呼吸，但还是要每天吸氧一到两个小时。
I recovered well, and on the fourth day the doctor removed the ventilator and let me breathe, but I still had to take in one or two hours of oxygen a day.
再去拍CT，我的肺部功能已经恢复了大半。
Take a CT scan and my lungs are almost half full again.
主治医生和护士都给我竖大拇指，都说我的身体好，夸我意志坚强。
The attending doctors and nurses gave me thumbs up and said that I was in good health and that I was strong-willed.
我怎么能不坚强，我还有妻子孩子要照顾。
I can't be strong. I have a wife and kids to take care of.
新京报：后来呢?胡安平：第五、六天，我开始能说一点话了，也能吃饭了，但还是没劲儿，动不了。
The Beijing News: Later? Hu Anping: In the fifth and sixth days, I began to speak a little, and I could eat, but I was still too weak to move.
插了导尿管，大小便都在床上，要去哪都得坐着轮椅。
The catheter was inserted, the urine was all in bed, and I had to be wheeled wherever I went.
我每天躺在床上努力练习，双手攥拳再伸开，双脚也多动动。
I lay in bed and practiced hard every day, my hands clenching my fists open and my feet moving.
练了两、三天，我可以拿手吃点东西了，医生就叫我练着写字，我就强行写字，脚也能动一点了。
After two or three days of practice, I could be adept at eating, the doctor told me to practice writing, and I forced myself to write, and my feet moved a little.
医生看我恢复得还可以，又叫我照CT，拍完片子，他说我的肺功能差不多恢复了，体温也正常了。
When the doctor saw that I was doing well and asked me to take a CT scan, he said my lung function was almost back and my temperature was normal.
1月17日，医生说我可以转到普通病房了。
On January 17, the doctor said I could transfer to the general ward.
新京报：在普通病房还要进行哪些治疗?胡安平：虽然转到普通病房了，但那时候我还是干咳，全身无力，手脚使不上劲儿，还是坐着轮椅转的病房。
The Beijing News: What else to do in the ordinary ward? Hu Anping: Although I was transferred to the general ward, I still had a dry cough, I was weak and my hands and feet were weak, and I was in a wheelchair.
我在普通病房隔离，每天还要打吊针。

每天体检，进行口腔生物标准检测，量血压、血脂、心跳，检测大小便之类的。

每天两次量体温，早上一次、下午一次，隔一天抽一次血。

新京报：身体情况呢?胡安平：还是无力，我每天一个人在病房扶着椅子、窗框练习站着，没有东西扶着就站不住。
The Beijing News: How about the health? Hu Anping: I'm still weak. I stand alone in the ward, holding the chair and window frame to practice everyday.
练了几天，不扶着东西开始能慢慢走了。
After a few days of practice, I can walk slowly without my help.
第三次拍CT时，医生说我的肺部功能已经完全恢复了，体温也正常了，就算是康复了吧。
On the third CT scan, the doctor said my lungs were fully functional and my temperature was normal, even if I was well again.
当时医生都说我这是第二次新生。
Doctors at the time said I was a second freshman.
康复之后还有一个隔离期，我在中南医院又住了一周，但是医院里的病患越来越多，床位太紧张了。
There was an isolation period after my recovery and I spent another week at the Zhongnan Hospital, but the number of patients in the hospital was increasing and the beds were too tight.
所以正月初四，我就出院了。
So on Thursday of January, I was discharged from hospital.
武汉有我的亲戚朋友，但我知道我得的这个病有传染性的，不敢去别人家，在宾馆自行隔离，到现在有15天了。
Wuhan has my relatives and friends, but I know my illness is contagious, do not dare to go to other people's homes, isolation in the hotel, now 15 days.
儿子在旁边屋里住着陪我，每天买了面包，饼干、泡面，我不敢出门，怕影响别人。

━━━━━“痊愈之后，我和亲友之间还要几个月磨合期”新京报：现在每天干点什么?胡安平：每天待在宾馆里，刷刷手机、看看新闻，有时候也刷抖音、看视频娱乐一下。

我最关心疫情的情况，每天醒来第一件事就是看看有没有新增的确诊人数，有没有新药等。
I'm most concerned about the epidemic. The first thing I wake up first is to see if there are any new cases, new drugs, etc.
我妻子每天给我打三个电话，早中晚各一次，我们互相报个平安。
My wife calls me three times a day, one in the morning and one in the evening.
新京报：之后有什么打算?胡安平：等武汉解除封城，隔离期结束，我就要回黄冈了。
The Beijing News: What's the plan after that? Hu Anping: When Wuhan is closed and the quarantine period is over, I'm going back to Huanggang.
亲戚朋友知道我得了这个病，肯定还是会有所顾忌，顾客可能也不敢光顾我的摊位了，我都能理解。
Friends and relatives know that I have this disease, I will certainly scruple, customers may not patronize my booth, I can understand.
我也和他们说了，尽管我现在已经痊愈了，但这两个月不要来找我，等到病毒被完全消除后再见面，我不想害他们。
