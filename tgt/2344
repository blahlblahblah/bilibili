封城隔离 时逢狂欢节的意大利如何战疫   。
The isolation of the city coincided with the outbreak of Carnival Italy.

经济观察网记者欧阳晓红几乎是一夜之间，新冠病毒袭击了意大利北部伦巴第和威尼托地区小城镇。
Almost overnight, Ouyang Xiaohong, a journalist with the Economic Watch, attacked small towns in northern Italy's Lombardy and Veneto regions.
。
.
确诊152例，死亡4例（最新增的一例是84岁老人）。
There were 152 confirmed cases and 4 deaths (the most recent case was 84 years old).
这是截至当地时间2月24日09时的意大利疫情数据。
This is the Italian epidemic data as of 0900 local time on 24 February.
而米兰以东的伦巴第地区出现第一批病例时就有89例。
There were 89 cases in the Lombardy region east of Milan.
23日晚间，奥地利宣布停止往返意大利的火车；法国右翼政客马琳·勒庞(Marine le Pen)还要求关闭意大利与法国的边境。
Last night Austria announced it was stopping trains to and from Italy, while right-wing French politician Marine le Pen called for Italy's border with France to be closed.
。
.
一边是时逢类似中国新年的Carnevale（意大利语：狂欢节），一边是Coronavirus（冠状病毒）蔓延；23号这天，意大利政府不得不宣布提早结束威尼斯狂欢节（该节日2月8日开始，原定2月25落幕），尽管狂欢节活动还在数百个城镇和村庄同期进行。
On the one hand, Carnevale (Italian for Carnival), on the other hand, Coronavirus (coronavirus), on the other; on February 23, the Italian government had to announce an early end to the Venice Carnival (which began on February 8 and was scheduled to close on February 25), although the carnival was held simultaneously in hundreds of towns and villages.
。
.
23日早上，国际米兰足球俱乐部微博发布官方声明称，原定于北京时间2月24日03:45进行的国际米兰主场对阵桑普多利亚的比赛将延期。
MILAN (Reuters) - Inter Milan's home game against Sampdoria, originally scheduled for 3: 45 pm (Feb. 24), will be postponed, an official statement said.
另外，意甲联赛第25轮三场比赛也因疫情将被推迟。
In addition, Serie A League 25 round of three games will also be postponed due to the outbreak of disease.
。
.
意大利米兰市长还下令该市所有学校和大学停课一周。
Italy's mayor also ordered all schools and universities in the city to suspend classes for a week.
23日晚间消息，意大利北部的另外四个地区将关闭学校和大学一周，如：皮埃蒙特、埃米利亚-罗马尼亚、利古里亚和阿尔托·阿迪格。
Four other districts in northern Italy, such as Piedmont, Emilia-Romania, Liguria and Alto Adigue, will close schools and universities for a week, it was announced Sunday night.
。
.
米兰以东伦巴第地区的12个小镇城被封锁，约5万人居家隔离。
Twelve towns in the Lombardy region, east of Milan, have been blockaded, isolating some 50,000 people.
人们不允许外出或工作。
People are not allowed to go out or work.
虽然不是完全隔离，其作用类似医疗控制，但效果一样。
Although not completely isolated, its effect is similar to that of medical control, but the effect is the same.
意大利《共和报》称，违反封城规定的人或将被监禁3个月或罚款206欧元。
According to the Italian newspaper La Repubblica, those who violate the cordon regulations will either be imprisoned for three months or fined 206 euros.
。
.
而个体在突发的疫情面前，显得有些失措，但生活未失序，生意则另当别论。
And individuals in the face of a sudden outbreak of disease, a bit of a panic, but life is not out of order, business is another matter.
。
.
“买了那么多口罩都送给国内的朋友；现在我自己没口罩了！”2月23日，一位在意大利罗马经商的华人感叹。
"I bought so many masks for my friends back home; now I don't have one myself," laments a Chinese businessman in Rome, Italy, on February 23.
他完全没想到意大利会出现疫情，他说，口罩已成罗马市面上的稀缺品了，价高且一物难求，但目前罗马的生活秩序平稳，没有出现传闻中的医院罢工、商店被打砸等乱象，包括这两天的狂欢节活动亦在正常进行。
He had no idea of an outbreak in Italy. He said masks were scarce in Rome and were expensive and difficult to come by, but life in Rome was calm, with no rumored hospital strikes, shops being smashed, including the two-day carnival.
。
.
因为疫情，这位经商者关闭了开业六年的中国餐馆。
Because of the outbreak, the trader closed down a Chinese restaurant that had been open for six years.
“这次至少要关门一年，旅游团一年内应该不会出来。
"It's going to be closed for at least a year and the group shouldn't be out for a year.
”他说。
'he said.
。
.
在罗马，像他这样关闭中国餐馆的小企业主不止他一个；而勉强营业的中餐馆，也大都处于亏损状态。
In Rome, he is not alone in shutting down Chinese restaurants, which are struggling to stay afloat.
非常时期，不愿凑热闹的他主动远离了罗马的狂欢节活动——这或许是，疫情时期的正确打开方式？。
Unwilling, he took the initiative to stay away from the carnival in Rome - perhaps the right way to start the epidemic?
国际著名病毒学家、米兰大学教授Fabrizio Pregliasco在电视采访中表示，目前正值冬季流感季节结束期；意大利去年约200人死于流感相关疾病——这非常正常，因为流感削弱了对现有疾病的抵抗力，如肺部疾病，这是导致死亡的原因之一，而儿童和年轻人死于各种流感(包括冠状病毒)的比例较低。
In a televised interview, Fabrizio Prigliasco, a professor at Milan University, said it was the end of the winter flu season; Italy had died of influenza-related illnesses last year - normal because the flu weakened resistance to existing diseases such as lung disease, a cause of death, and children and young people died of influenza, including coronavirus.
。
.
“这种情况有些疯狂！这只是一种强烈的流感，其实，人们总是死于流感。
"It's a bit crazy! It's just a strong flu, and people always die from it.
”米兰大学著名教授、重点医院之一的Ospedale Luigi Sacco的微生物和病毒学主任Maria Rita Gismondo教授说。
Professor Maria Rita Gismondo, Director of Microbiology and Virology at Ospedale Luigi Sacco, one of the leading hospitals at the University of Milan.
。
.
这是真的吗？就像在意大利，23日下午宣布的第三例死亡——死者是一名来自米兰东部城镇Crema的妇女，此前她因癌症住院。
Is that true? As in Italy, the third death was announced on the afternoon of the 23rd - the death of a woman from the eastern Milan town of Crema, who had been hospitalized for cancer.
。
.
当下的现状是，两天时间，突发疫情令意大利12个小城镇被封锁，5万人居家隔离。
For two days, a sudden outbreak has shut down 12 small towns in Italy and isolated 50,000 people.
政府表示，如有必要，警方甚至军方都将出动确保隔离秩序。
The government says the police and even the military will move to ensure order if necessary.
意大利总理孔特强调，除非有特殊许可，任何人严禁进入或离开受疫情影响而“封城隔离”的城市。
Italian Prime Minister Conte stressed that no one was allowed to enter or leave a city "sealed off" by the outbreak unless a special permit was granted.
。
.
一。
One.
似乎无症状的病毒携带者防不胜防。
Seemingly asymptomatic carriers of the virus are overwhelmed.
。
.
几天前，人们以为一定程度上冠状病毒的传播得以控制，因其主要局限于湖北省。
A few days ago, it was thought that the transmission of the coronavirus could be controlled to some extent because it was mainly confined to Hubei Province.
在中国以外，特别是在欧洲，疫情颇为罕见。
Outside China, particularly in Europe, outbreaks are rare.
诸如，此前在意大利只有两名病例，甚至从武汉撤离并被隔离两周的意大利人也未发现新冠病毒肺炎感染者。
For example, only two cases have been reported in Italy, and even Italians evacuated from Wuhan and held in quarantine for two weeks have not been found to have contracted the virus.
但2月21日之后，一两天时间，确诊者就增加了148例。
After 21 February, however, 148 more cases were diagnosed within a day or two.
。
.
其导火索或是：2月21日晚间，意大利米兰以东40公里附近的一些小城镇发现12例确诊病例；次日，新增136位确诊病例。
On the evening of 21 February, 12 confirmed cases were detected in small towns located 40 kilometres east of Milan, Italy, and 136 new cases were confirmed the following day.
。
.
当地官方在记者会上表示，伦巴第大区5名医生，14名其他人员都是在去了同一家酒吧后被确诊感染。
Local officials told a news conference that five doctors and 14 others in Lombardy had been diagnosed with infection after going to the same bar.
而首个确诊病人是位38岁的男士，其因“流感”不适去看过急诊，后因呼吸衰竭前往当地医院急诊——医生们才得知，此前他曾跟一名从中国回来的朋友一起吃饭，于是对他进行了核酸检测，最终发现他感染了新冠肺炎。
The first confirmed case was a 38-year-old man who went to an emergency department because of flu and went to a local hospital for emergency treatment because of respiratory failure - doctors learned that he had been tested for nucleic acid with a friend who had returned from China and was found to be infected with pneumonia.
但他那位中国回来的朋友无任何症状，核酸检测也显示阴性。
But his friend from China did not have any symptoms, and the nucleic acid test showed no sign of it.
。
.
他的一名球友被其感染，这名球友又是一家酒吧老板的儿子，于是他又传染了这家酒吧的3个常客。
One of his buddies, the son of a bar owner, became infected, and he infected three regular patrons of the bar.
现在，与这位38岁男子有过接触的上百人都在等待检测结果。
Hundreds of people who have come into contact with the 38-year-old man are now awaiting test results.
。
.
另一条线索是：21日晚间，在威尼斯以西75公里的威尼托地区的一个小村庄，也出现了两起病例，夜间一名78岁的男性患者死亡——其或是在欧洲地区首个欧洲公民死亡病例；当天，在罗马地区的拉齐奥亦发现了3例确诊患者。
Another clue is that on the night of May 21, in a small village in the Veneto region, 75 kilometers west of Venice, there were two cases of a 78-year-old male who died at night - the first European citizen in Europe - and three confirmed cases were found in Lazio, Rome.
。
.
意大利卫生部对此迅速做出反应。
The Italian Ministry of Health responded quickly.
疫情相关地区8个小城镇的学校、工厂和商店均被关闭。
Schools, factories and shops were closed in eight small towns in the affected areas.
伦巴第地区的克雷莫纳是一座古老大城市，几个世纪以来，它以小提琴制造而闻名于世。
Cremona in Lombardy is an old city famous for its violin making for centuries.
意大利总理孔特22日晚间宣布，暂时关闭疫情高发地区的出入口。
Italian Prime Minister Conte announced on the night of 22, temporarily closed the outbreak of high-risk areas of access.
。
.
意大利当地居民开始担心——还会有更多的小疫情吗?这些会蔓延到米兰、威尼斯或罗马等城市吗?因为这些意大利北部城市之间的地区是中小企业最集中的工业区之一，若其被疫情波及，恐怕会影响意大利的经济。
Are Italy's local residents beginning to worry - and will there be more outbreaks? Will this spread to cities like Milan, Venice, or Rome? Because these northern Italian cities are one of the most densely populated industrial zones for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which could affect Italy's economy.
。
.
问题还在于，迄今为止，没有人能确定这种病毒是如何在这些地方传播的，而且它们是同一天发生在不同的地点，这引起了人们的担忧。
It is also a matter of concern that, to date, no one has been able to determine how the virus was transmitted in these places and that they took place in different locations on the same day.
这些城市比中国受感染的城市要小，但所有的口罩都已经卖出去了，报纸上和意大利电视新闻上看到的空荡荡街道照片看起来——就像一个迷你武汉城；火车经过那些被感染地区时也不再停在那里的车站。
These cities are smaller than China's infected cities, but all the masks have been sold, and the empty street photos in the newspapers and on Italian television news look like a mini-Wuhan city; trains no longer stop at the stations where they pass through infected areas.
。
.
如果说，意大利的疫情蔓延或与无症状的病毒携带者有关，那么，这种新冠病毒还会怎样扩散呢？。
If the epidemic in Italy is widespread or linked to asymptomatic carriers, how will the new crown virus spread?
事实上，类似严峻的疫情正在韩国与日本发生。
Indeed, similar severe outbreaks are occurring in South Korea and Japan.
与之对应的是，中国的疫情目前得以初步遏制，尽管未至拐点。
Correspondingly, the epidemic in China has so far been contained, albeit not to the point of inflection.
。
.
医学圈称新冠肺炎病毒为“流氓”，是因其不按常理出牌、潜伏期飘忽不定（1天至24天）、传播途径难以捉摸；有些病毒携带者自身没有症状，不发烧不咳嗽，但传给别人就很重；有些患者治愈后还会复发或携带病毒，以致于患者痊愈后还需自我隔离14天。
Medical circles call the virus "hooliganism" because of its unorthodox cards, erratic latency (1-24 days), and erratic transmission; some carriers have no symptoms of their own, do not have a fever or cough, but carry a heavy burden to others; some have relapses or carry the virus after cure, leaving the patient isolated for 14 days.
。
.
“我们正处在新冠全球大流行的边缘。
"We are on the brink of a new global pandemic.
”美国顶级传染病医生Anthony Fauci接受采访时表示。
Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious diseases doctor, said in an interview.

眼下，猝不及防的疫情改变了意大利延续多个世纪的文化活动，亦波及意大利重要经济事件——世界眼镜展会被无奈延期至5月。
At the moment, the catch-all epidemic has transformed Italy's centuries-old cultural activities, and has rippled through important economic events in Italy, where the World Glasses Show has had to be postponed until May.
。
.
狂欢节活动对意大利而言，是一个已存在几个世纪的重大文化事件，其重要性类似中国的新年。
Carnival for Italy is a centuries-old cultural event of similar importance to the Chinese New Year.
。
.
威尼斯狂欢节（意⼤利语为“Carnevale”）源于古代基督教徒的惯例。
The Venice Carnival (meaning "Carnevale") originated from the customs of ancient Christians.
在复活 节，即相信耶稣被钉死在⼗字架的三天后复活的信仰建⽴当天前四⼗天，所有基督教徒过去通常会——并且很多基督教徒现在仍然会——进⾏为期四⼗天的斋戒，尤其是戒掉⾁⾷和奢侈的⾷品⽐如巧克⼒。
Four days before the Day of the Resurrection, the faith that Jesus was crucified and resurrected three days later, all Christians used - and many Christians still do - to take part in a four-day fast, especially the Chaucer Chauffeur, the quid pro quo.
传统上，大斋节从圣灰星期三开始（复活前46天，即40天加上6个周⽇），从周四到周⼆连续的⼏天就是狂欢节。
Traditionally, Lent begins on Ash Wednesday (46 days before resurrection, that is, 40 days plus 6 weeks of wiggle), and the consecutive days of zeal from Thursday to Zhou are carnival.
在法国被称为忏悔星期⼆的周⼆在意⼤利被称为“新奥尔良”和“肥腻星期⼆”，是这⼀时期的⾼潮，会举⾏很多仪式并且是⼈们饱餐的最后机会。
The so-called repentance week in France, called "New Orleans" and "Fattening Week," is the turning point of this era, with many rituals and the last chance for a full meal.
在圣灰星期三时，基督教徒通常会⽤灰烬在前额做画⼗字的姿势，标志着过去的毁灭，并进⼊⼀个斋戒和赎罪的时期。
On Ash Wednesday, Christians would turn to ashes to mark the destruction of the past and to stage a period of fasting and atonement.
。
.
米兰的几家重要公司，以及至少一家总部设在那里的欧洲大型银行，过去几天里召开了应急会议，制定应对疫情形势恶化的计划。
Major Milan companies, as well as at least one of the big European banks headquartered there, have held emergency meetings over the past few days to work out a plan to deal with the worsening situation.
对该银行来说，有两个潜在原因：首先，他们在城镇有分支机构，那里有确诊的病例，其次，如果大楼里发生疫情，总部大楼里只有一个供暖和空调系统，恐怕很难管理。
For the Bank, there were two potential reasons: first, they had branches in the towns, where there had been confirmed cases, and, secondly, if there was an outbreak in the building, there would be only one heating and air-conditioning system in the headquarters building, which would be difficult to manage.
这将影响欧洲和世界其他地区银行的效率，并对股价和其他主要公司产生明显的影响。
This will affect the efficiency of banks in Europe and the rest of the world, and will have a clear impact on share prices and other major companies.
。
.
值得一提的是，意大利北部所有的大学和学校至少关闭一周。
It is worth mentioning that all universities and schools in northern Italy are closed for at least one week.
。
.
该地区电影院、博物馆、剧院和体育赛事取消。
Cinemas, museums, theatres and sporting events in the region were cancelled.
这很不寻常，因为米兰的斯卡拉歌剧院是世界上最重要的歌剧院之一，拥有伦敦柯芬园和纽约大都会歌剧院，其在200年间只关闭过6次。
This is unusual because Milan's Scala Opera is one of the world's most important opera houses, with London's Covent Garden and the New York Metropolitan Opera House, which have been closed only six times in 200 years.
。
.
米兰的酒吧和迪斯科舞厅等也都悉数关门。
The bars and discotheques in Milan were also closed.
。
.
更为重要的是，原定于本周开幕的世界眼镜展会被推迟到五月，该展会对经济很重要，因为世界上最大的眼镜公司是Luxottica(占世界市场的80%)，总部在米兰，其在意大利证券交易所上市。
More importantly, the World Glasses Fair, which was scheduled to open this week, was postponed until May and is important for the economy, as the world's largest eyeglasses company is Luxottica (80 per cent of the world market), headquartered in Milan and listed on the Italian Stock Exchange.
它为所有主要的时尚品牌生产眼镜，如阿玛尼、宝格丽、巴宝莉、香奈儿、杜嘉班纳、范思哲和普拉达。
It manufactures eyeglasses for all major fashion brands, such as Armani, Burgli, Burberry, Chanel, Dugabana, Versace and Prada.
他们还在世界各地拥有9000家零售店，包括中国。
They also have 9,000 retail outlets worldwide, including in China.
。
.
Luxottica自1997年进入中国，并拥有三星光学有限公司，在上海、东莞和广东有生产、批发和零售业务。
Luxottica has been in China since 1997 and owns Samsung Optics Ltd., with manufacturing, wholesale and retail operations in Shanghai, Dongguan and Guangdong.
它旗下拥有LensCrafters和Sunglass Hut品牌店。
It owns LensCrafts and Sunglass Hut stores.
。
.
另一个问题是，涉及与法国、瑞士、奥地利、斯洛文尼亚和克罗地亚等邻国的跨境联系，以及与其他申根成员国的总体联系等……它们会受到突发的疫情影响吗？这些问题将在周一于布鲁塞尔举行的欧盟重要会议上进行讨论。
Another question is whether cross-border links with neighboring countries such as France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, and Croatia, as well as with other Schengen members in general... will they be affected by a sudden outbreak? These issues will be discussed at a major EU meeting in Brussels on Monday.
