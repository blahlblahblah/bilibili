”2月10日，湖北恒祺建筑装饰工程有限公司总经理熊礼杰对《棱镜》表示。
On February 10, Xiong Lijie, general manager of Hubei Heng Qi Architectural Decoration Engineering Co. Ltd, told Prism.
就在这一天，作为参与火神山、雷神山医院隔断吊顶装修的单位，他们收到了工程款项，此时距离他们该项目完工仅三天左右时间。
On that day, as participants in the renovation of the ceiling of Mount Fire and Lei Shenshan Hospital, they received payment for the works, only about three days before the completion of the project.
分别用10天建成的火神山、雷神山医院，是多家工程分包单位与个人通力配合的成果，背后的工程款项结算量大且要求日清。
The 10-day building of the Fire God Hill, Lei Shenshan Hospital, is a number of subcontracting units and individuals work together, the project behind the settlement of a large amount of requirements and the Japanese Qing.
以火神山医院项目为例，据浦发银行武汉分行方面介绍，总承包单位中建三局对合作单位（包括劳务公司、分包单位、供应商等）有涉及近3亿元资金结算，资金及时划拨对保证工期非常重要。
According to the Wuhan branch of Pudong Development Bank, three of the total contracting units involved in the settlement of nearly 300 million yuan of funds (including labor companies, subcontractors, suppliers, etc.).
因此，浦发银行武汉分行在中建三局接到任务当晚即商定应急方案，在总行支持下优化网银支付渠道和业务受理规则，使网银假期也能实时受理大额业务；同时在后台作业中心和落地业务安排专人保障，最终确保工期如期完成。
Therefore, the Wuhan branch of Pudong Bank received the task in the three bureaus agreed on the emergency plan that night, with the support of the head office to optimize the network bank payment channels and business acceptance rules, so that the real-time processing of large-scale business; and in the backstage operations centre and landing business arrangements to ensure that the project deadline.
这场疫情狙击战中，医疗、基建、运输等各行业通力合作，金融机构则以畅通资金支付、结算以及信贷通道为主要目标，在后方展开了一场别样的金融“战疫”。
During the sniper war against the epidemic, the medical, infrastructure, transportation and other industries worked together, and financial institutions focused on unimpeded payment, settlement and credit lines, launching a different kind of financial "epidemic" in the rear.
从大年三十开始的施工任务据熊礼杰回忆，公司是在大年三十那天，首先接到了武汉光谷三医院病房的紧急改造任务。
According to Xiong Lijie's recollection, the company is in the 30th year, first received Wuhan Guanggu three hospital ward emergency renovation mission.
正值除夕，在联系了七八个工程队无果后，熊礼杰发在朋友圈里的招工信息终于等来了一条留言回复：“有需要可以联系我。
On New Year's Eve, after contacting seven or eight engineering teams without success, Xiong Lijie finally sent a message saying: "If you need me, please contact me.
”留言人叫徐华明，当时人还在湖北省黄冈市蕲春县老家。
The message was sent by Xu Huaoming, whose native Agkistrodon acutus county, Huanggang City, Hubei Province.
“在那个时候留言，意味着要放弃和家人的团聚，并且再来到疫情最严重的地方干活，没有点家国情怀是做不到的。
"To leave a message at that time means to give up family reunion and go back to work in the worst part of the epidemic.
“熊礼杰至今仍很感慨。
"Xiong Lijie is still deeply moved.
而徐华明很快找来3个同村老乡，从百里外的黄冈包车赶到武汉。
Xu Huaoming quickly found three fellow villagers, from a hundred miles away Huanggang charter car to Wuhan.
当时，不少工人还正在家吃团年饭。
At that time, many workers were still home to eat reunion dinner.
就在徐华明等连夜完成光谷三医院改造任务的同时，1月23日，武汉市决定由中建集团在汉企业中建三局牵头，在武汉市蔡甸区火速建设火神山医院。
On January 23, Wuhan City decided to set up three bureaus in Han enterprises, led by China Construction Group, to build a fire-god mountain hospital in Cai Den district of Wuhan.
“招工。
"Recruiting.
急！急！急！” 几乎同一时间，熊礼杰等分包商都收到中建三局关于火神山医院项目招募建设工人的消息。
Urgent! Urgent! Urgent! Urgent! "Almost the same time, Xiong Lijie and other subcontractors have received three Bureau of fire Shenshan Hospital project recruitment construction workers.
“中建三局并没有明确要求每个工程队要提供多少人，但我们都在尽自己所能去发动招募工人。
"China Construction didn't ask exactly how many people each team would provide, but we were all doing our best to recruit people."
”熊礼杰表示，“大家都觉得这是一种使命。
"Everyone thinks it's a mission," says Mr Xiong.
”于是，大年初一这天，刚刚完工的徐华明等人又迅速参与到火神山医院的建设中。
"So, New Year's Day, just completed Xu Huaoming and other people quickly participate in the construction of the Mount Fire Hospital.
由于人手紧缺，他们每天都要加班， “三班倒不停歇，节奏非常快”。
Because of the shortage of staff, they have to work overtime every day, "three shifts do not stop, very fast pace."
火神山医院交付后，2月6日，熊礼杰的公司又接到雷神山医院的紧急建设任务。
After the delivery of the Mount Huo hospital, on February 6, Xiong Lijie's company received the urgent task of construction of the Raytheon Mountain Hospital.
熊礼杰想尽办法，联系安排了30多位施工和管理人员，耗时两天两夜完成了雷神山项目分包区域的吊顶和隔断施工。
Xiong did everything in his power to contact more than 30 construction and management personnel, and took two days and two nights to complete the suspension and partitioning of the Raytheon Mountain subcontracting area.
“今天还另外联系了20多个专业的水电班组赶往现场，预计下午和晚上就能完工。
"More than 20 professional hydroelectric teams were contacted today and are expected to be completed in the afternoon and the evening.
”10日当天，熊礼杰告诉《棱镜》。
"On the 10th, Xiong told Prism.
大年初一，三级联动完成5000万汇款算起来，熊礼杰前后为火神山、雷神山医院建设组织了近50名施工人员。
New Year's Day, three-level linkage to complete the calculation of 50 million remittances, Xiong Lijie before and after the god of fire, Lei Shenshan Hospital for the construction of nearly 50 workers.
虽然在火、雷神山医院建设总计近15000名施工人员中并不太起眼，但在争分夺秒抢建设工期之际，每一位建设者都至关重要。
While the construction of the Fire and Lei Shenshan Hospital, with a total of nearly 15,000 workers, is not all that spectacular, every builder matters as it scrambles for the construction schedule.
尽管多位工人在接受媒体采访时均表示，参与这两个项目，都不是为了工资而来，但从总包商到熊礼杰均明白，为此刻冒着危险加班加点的工人们及时结清工资，也是首要任务之一。
Although many workers in interviews with the media said they were not involved in either project for pay, from the general contractor to Xiong Raijie, it was one of the top priorities to settle the wages of the workers who were running dangerous overtime at the moment.
据熊礼杰介绍，按照行规，工人工资均是当天发放，先期由分包商垫付，总包稍后结算。
According to Xiong Laijie, according to the industry regulations, workers are paid on the same day, by subcontractors in advance, the package later settled.
以火神山医院10天近3亿元资金结算计算，包括工资在内，建设现场每天的结算款项应达数千万元。
Based on the 10-day settlement of nearly 300 million yuan of funds, including wages, the daily settlement of the construction site should amount to tens of millions of yuan.
但与往常不同的是，此时正值春节假期，银行都还在休假。
But as usual, it was Spring Festival and the banks were still on holiday.
大年初一（1月25日），也就是火神山医院开工第一天，中建三局急需汇款5000万元用于支付火神山医院建设费用，但这一笔款项一度汇不出去。
On January 25, the first day of the construction of the Mount Huoshen Hospital, China Construction Co., the three bureaus urgently needed 50 million yuan to pay for the construction of the Mount Fire Hospital, but the money could not be remitted.
按照农业银行事后的复盘，因为节假日期间人行大额系统不开放，单位可通过企业网银进行汇款。
According to the Agricultural Bank after the resumption of trading, because the large-scale system during holidays closed, the unit can be transferred through the enterprise network bank.
春节期间人民银行将小额支付限额放宽至5亿元，农业银行也做了相应更改。
During the Spring Festival, the People's Bank relaxed the minimum payment limit to 500 million yuan, and the Agricultural Bank changed it accordingly.
当中建三局将此笔网银汇款不成功反馈农行时，农业银行武汉江汉循礼门支行4名员工，分别从武汉青山、汉阳等地赶往网点办理，随后发现是网银限额问题。
Among them, the bank will not be a successful remittance of money back to ABC, the Agricultural Bank of Wuhan Jianghan follow the four staff members, Qingshan, Hanyang, Wuhan, and other locations to handle the network, then found that the limit is the silver network.
于是循礼门网点立即反馈给武汉分行，武汉分行运营主管赶紧联系省分行后台中心、省行科技部门后，发现更改权限在总行，又紧急联系总行科技部进行修改。
The head of Wuhan branch immediately contacted the backstage center of the branch of the province and the technical department of the province, and found that the change of authority in the head office, and emergency contact the Ministry of Science and Technology to make changes.
最终在总分支三级行联动下及时完成资金转账。
Finally in the main branch of three-tier linkage timely completion of funds transfer.
于是，开工第一天，分包商都收到了来自中建三局的款项，也及时结清了工人工资。
As a result, on the first day of the works, the subcontractors received payments from China Construction's three bureaus and settled the workers' salaries in a timely manner.
“两大医院建设牵动着全国人民的心，我们第一时间组织人力、调拨资金确保建设进度不延误。
"The construction of the two major hospitals has touched the hearts and minds of people all over the country.We first organized manpower and allocated funds to ensure that the construction progress was not delayed.
”农行科技部相关人士对《棱镜》介绍。
Relevant personage of Agriculture Bank of China science and technology introduces to prism.
信贷驰援“火雷神山”建设企业在医院建设中，为防止土壤、水源被病毒等污染，防渗工作至关重要。

Dongguang Rainbow Brothers high-energy environment also participated in the construction of Mount Huoshen Hospital, undertake 30,000 square meters of anti-seepage works, and provide materials and related services.
建设工期短、任务急，使得工程建设类企业承担更大的资金垫付压力。
Short construction period, urgent task, so that the construction of enterprises to bear more capital to pay the pressure.
《棱镜》从民生银行获悉，春节前民生银行北京分行已先后为两家企业合计发放贷款3.9亿元，缓解了资金垫付压力。
Minsheng Bank has received 390 million yuan in loans from the Beijing branch of Minsheng Bank before the Spring Festival, relieving pressure on funds to pay in advance, the bank said.
民生银行北京分行方面介绍，正协调行内信贷资源，拟为东方雨虹追加信贷支持2亿元，并通过国内信用证形式降低企业融资成本，支持其生产经营和各项建设工作。
Minsheng Bank, Beijing Branch, said it was coordinating credit resources within the bank to support 200 million yuan in additional credit for Rainbow in the East and to reduce the cost of financing enterprises through domestic letters of credit to support their production and operation and various construction work.
而北京谊安医疗系统股份有限公司主要负责为火神山、雷神山医院提供呼吸机系统解决方案。

The company's cable supplies were supplied by Jiangsu Baosheng Technology, after AgBank's Yangzhou branch made loans worth 280 million yuan in line with the company's needs.
除火神山、雷神山医院建设企业外，多家医疗物资企业抓紧复工，银行业金融机构对疫情防控企业的融资需求也开通绿色通道。
In addition to the construction enterprises in the Mountain of Fire and the Raytheon Mountain Hospital, many medical material enterprises have been put back to work.

As of noon February 11, more than 349 billion yuan of credit had been provided by banking financial institutions to support epidemic prevention and control and the resumption of production, according to the China Banking Association.
多家银行出台中小企业贷款展期政策让熊礼杰感到安心的，还不仅仅是工程款的火速回笼。
A number of banks issued SME loan rollover policy so that Xiong Lijie feel at ease, not just the project money back into the cage.
他告诉《棱镜》，公司去年在湖北银行办理了一笔等额本息还款的贷款，日前，他接到来自银行的电话，告诉他如果还款有压力可以申请贷款展期，展期期间归还利息即可。
He told Prism that the company made an equally important repayment loan at Hubei Bank last year, and he received a phone call from the bank telling him he could apply for an extension of the loan if he was under pressure to repay it.
受疫情影响，部分中小企业营业收入锐减，短期现金流压力较大。
Affected by the epidemic, some small and medium-sized enterprises operating income plummeted, short-term cash flow pressure.
因此，多家银行针对受疫情影响的中小企业，还出台了贷款展期或支持相关政策。
As a result, a number of banks have extended or supported policies for small and medium-sized enterprises affected by the epidemic.
中国进出口银行日前宣布，免收湖北省以及受疫情影响较大的批发零售和物流运输行业相关中小微企业2月份贷款利息，涉及贷款近1600亿元，利息免收金额约6亿元。
The Export-Import Bank of China (EXIM) announced that it would exempt MSMEs in Hubei Province and the wholesale, retail and logistics industries affected by the epidemic from interest payments in February, involving nearly 160 billion yuan in loans and an interest-free sum of 600 million yuan.
浙商银行则明确将2020年2月3日至2020年3月20日设定为政策宽限期（视疫情变化适时调整）。
Zhejiang Commercial Bank has explicitly set a policy grace period from February 3, 2020 to March 20, 2020 (adjusted for changes in the epidemic).

In addition, the system automatically reviews the active renewal for up to one year for micro and small enterprises that meet the relevant conditions in the wholesale, retail, accommodation, cultural tourism, transportation and residential services industries that are more affected by the epidemic and whose credit expires by 30 June 2020.
2月11日，农业银行也明确，对确因延迟复工导致无法按时偿还到期贷款的客户，将还款日顺延至省政府规定的最早复工日，期间不算作逾期贷款，不计罚息复利。
On 11 February, the Agricultural Bank also made it clear that for clients who were unable to repay their overdue loans on time owing to the delayed resumption of work, the repayment date was extended to the earliest rework date set by the provincial government, during which time it would not count as overdue loans, with no penalty interest compound interest.
对于还款困难但有发展前景的客户，可提供宽限期、展期、无还本续贷、中长期贷款等梯度措施，针对性持续提供信贷支持。
Gradient measures such as grace periods, renewals, non-current loans and medium- and long-term loans may be provided to customers who have difficulties in repaying their loans but who have prospects for development.
熊礼杰告诉《棱镜》，公司在2月份原本应缴纳税款上百万元，员工工资支出也有数十万元。
Xiong told Prism that the company should have paid millions of dollars in taxes and hundreds of thousands of dollars in payroll expenses in February.
由于公司主要项目都在武汉，受疫情影响部分在建项目暂停施工，不少应收账款由于甲方单位未能复工还未收到，压力较大。
As the company's main projects are in Wuhan, affected by the epidemic part of the project suspended construction, many accounts receivable due to the failure of Party A units to resume work has not been received, pressure is greater.
不过，湖北省税务局已出台政策，将2月份的纳税申报期限延长至3月6日，如果受疫情影响仍有困难，可依法申请进一步延期。
However, the Hubei Provincial Taxation Office has issued a policy extending the February tax return period to March 6, and may legally apply for a further extension if it is still difficult to be affected by the epidemic.
“这些政策可以极大缓解我们的短期压力。
"These policies can significantly relieve our short-term stress.
只希望疫情赶紧过去吧。
Just hope the epidemic is over.
”熊礼杰表示。
