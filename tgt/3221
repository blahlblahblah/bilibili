澎湃新闻记者 南博一为遏制新冠病毒的传播，3月8日，意大利封锁了该国北部的伦巴第大区和11个邻近省份，1600万人的自由流动受到影响，封锁将一直持续到4月3日。
The free movement of 16 million people was affected by Italy's blockade of the Lombardy region and 11 neighbouring provinces in the north of the country on 8 March to stem the spread of the new crown virus, which will continue until 3 April.
“我们面临着一个紧急情况，一个全国性的紧急情况，” 据《纽约时报》3月8日报道，意大利总理孔特（Giuseppe Conte）在当天凌晨2点的新闻发布会上宣布，一份关于抑制新冠肺炎疫情扩散的法令已于3月8日正式生效。
"We are facing an emergency, a national emergency," Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced at a 2 a.m. news conference that March 8 had entered into force to curb the spread of pneumonia in the New Crown.
《华尔街日报》7日获取了意大利政府的上述法令草案，称该国将对北部的伦巴第大区和11个邻近省份实施全面限制，这些限制措施将会影响到意大利四分之一的人口。
The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday obtained the Italian government's draft decree, saying it would impose sweeping restrictions on the northern region of Lombardy and 11 neighboring provinces, which would affect a quarter of Italy's population.
该法令称，这些地区的人们应该“绝对避免任何进出该地区的活动”，只有在涉及“不可推迟”的商业或健康问题时，民众才可以在受影响地区内活动。
The decree says people in these areas should "absolutely avoid any movement into or out of the area" and that people should be allowed to operate in affected areas only if there are "non-deferrable" commercial or health issues.
报道称，此举在短期内相当于牺牲意大利经济，此前，意大利已对多个出现疫情的城镇采取封闭措施。
The move is said to be tantamount to sacrificing Italy's economy in the short term, following Italy's closure of several towns affected by the outbreak.
新法令将进一步把意大利富裕的北部地区——包括经济和文化之都米兰以及威尼斯等地标性旅游目的地变成隔离红区，并且至少到4月3日才能解禁。
The new law will further turn Italy's wealthy northern regions - including the economic and cultural capital of Milan and Venice - into red-zone ghettos, which will not be lifted until at least April 3.
此外，在这些地区，葬礼和文化活动都被禁止，泳池将被关闭，医疗工作者的休假也将被取消。
In addition, funerals and cultural activities are prohibited in these areas, swimming pools will be closed and leave for medical workers will be cancelled.
该法令还要求酒吧和餐馆必须保证顾客之间至少保持一米的距离，否则他们也将被迫关门。
The law also requires bars and restaurants to ensure at least one metre of space between customers who would otherwise be forced to close.
《华尔街日报》消息称，警察和军队都将在场保证该法令的实施，违反法令的人可能会被罚款或监禁。
The Wall Street Journal said both the police and the military will be there to ensure the law is enforced, with violators likely to be fined or jailed.
