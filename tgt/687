我是一个写财经文章的，本来传染病这种事情和我八杆子也打不着，可事情就是这么魔幻，一不小心成了火神山医院的“网红患者”。
I am a financial article, originally infectious diseases and I can not fight eight rod, but the matter is so magical, accidentally became the fire god mountain hospital "net red patient."
等我出去，我会向大家展示，我的家乡武汉有多美。
When I go out, I will show you how beautiful my hometown Wuhan is.
口述 | 万先生整理 | 黄　祺2月4日早上10点多，我上了救护车，真快，高架上基本上都是120公里的速度，一路飞驰到了火神山医院。
At about 10 a.m. on February 4, I got into an ambulance. It was so fast that the shelves were almost 120 kilometers high, and I sped all the way to Mount Fire Hospital.
下车的时候，医院给每个人配了轮椅，可是我没有要，我要自己走！2月4日上午9时许，转运首批患者的车辆抵达火神山医院　摄影 |鲜敢一步一步沿着长长的过道走过去，我看见上方飞着的无人机，一路跟着我，我向它打招呼。
When I got off the bus, everyone was given a wheelchair, but I didn't want it, so I had to go myself! At about 9 a.m. on February 4, the vehicles carrying the first batch of patients arrived at Mount Fujimori Hospital.
屋顶上一大群摄影记者，我也给他们挥手示意，可能他们没有遇到这么精神的患者，也很兴奋，向我挥手。
On the roof of a large group of photographers, I waved to them, perhaps they did not meet the spirit of the patients, but also very excited to wave to me.
我没想到这是直播，我的朋友在电视上都看见我一边挥手、一边挥舞拳头走进病房，他们都说，你太给力了。
I didn't know it was live. My friends on TV saw me wave my hand and wave my fist into the room. They all said, You're too hard.
咱可是条汉子，关键时刻，不能孬！万先生进了病房，护士马上给我上了监护，并且给我吸氧，说实话，还真舒服。
Mr. Wan goes into the ward, and the nurse immediately gives me supervision and gives me oxygen. To tell the truth, it is very comfortable.
我没忘记先答应网友的事，赶紧把整个房间的设施都拍下来然后发出去了。
I didn't forget to promise the netizen thing first, hurriedly took the whole room's facilities to photograph and then sent out.
这下可出大事了！瞬时全国无数人涌入我的头条号和新开的抖音号，无数留言潮水般涌来，我根本来不及看就被刷飞了，太惊人了。
It was a big deal! There was an instant flood of headlines and new dithering numbers from all over the country, and countless comments poured in, and I was brushed off before I could see it.
生病以后我一直在发日记和视频，我公开自己的经历不为别的，就是为了让大家多点信心，这个病可以治疗的。
I've been posting diaries and videos since I got sick, and I've made my experience public for nothing else, just to give people more confidence that the disease can be treated.
这个时候，什么都可以输，信心不能输。
At this time, anything can lose, confidence can not lose.
Play万先生2月5日在火神山医院病房里拍摄的视频备齐口罩、酒精、手套，还是中招了我这个人比较敏感，说起这次生病，我仿佛有预感似的。
Mr. Play Wan took the video on Feb. 5 in the hospital ward at Mount Fujimori Hospital, prepared a mask, alcohol, gloves, or admitted me as a sensitive person. I had a presentiment about the illness.
12月31日湖北最早开始讲发现新型肺炎的新闻，我当时就有预感觉得会变得严重。
On December 31 in Hubei Province, the first news of the discovery of the new pneumonia, I had a presentiment that it would get worse.
我跟老婆说我们去外地一段时间吧，她没同意。
I told my wife we should be away for a while. She didn't agree.
那个时候新闻里说的是没有发现人传人，但我已经在自己做防护的准备了。
At the time, the news was that there was no human-to-human transmission, but I was already making preparations for my own defense.
元旦后我立刻购买了各种口罩，还有各种消毒药水和酒精，我甚至还买了五盒专用的医用手套。
Immediately after New Year's Day, I bought a variety of masks, disinfectants and alcohol, and I even bought five boxes of special medical gloves.
应该说我防护已经很严密了，可惜还是中招了。
I should have said that I was well protected, but I confessed.
现在想来，可能就是眼睛的粘膜感染，虽然我戴着眼镜。
Now I think it's probably an infection of the mucous membranes of my eyes, even though I wear glasses.
我是70后，平时身体比较健康，现在回忆，生病前我曾经去过的地方只有三个，武汉市江岸区解放公园路中轻大楼里的写字班（孩子在那里上课），武汉天地皇家芭蕾舞（孩子上课），后来去参加了皇家芭蕾舞在湖北剧院的表演，所有往返都是自驾车或者网约车。
Today, I have only three places I visited before I fell ill. There are only three writing classes in the middle and light buildings on Jiefang Park Road, Wuhan City (where the children attend classes), the Royal Ballet in Wuhan City (children attend classes), and later attend the Royal Ballet in Hubei Theatre.
由于形势严峻，从22日开始我们一家就在家自行隔离，全部不出家门，我连出门丢垃圾都是严密防护。
Due to the severe situation, our family has been isolated from home since the 22nd, all do not leave the house, I even go out to throw garbage is closely guarded.
住院前万先生在家中自我隔离一切都从1月24日发生改变。
Mr. Wan isolated himself at home until he was hospitalized and everything changed on 24 January.
24日下午例行给母亲打电话问候，得知老人发烧了，我当时就警觉起来，立刻在家测量，体温37.3度，于是马上进入卧室开始隔离。
24 afternoon routine called my mother to greet, learned that the old man had a fever, I was alerted, immediately home measurement, 37.3 degrees, and immediately entered the bedroom to start isolation.
由于之前已经有所警觉，22日就开始吃提前购买的奥司他韦，每日一粒的预防模式，加上莲花清瘟胶囊也是立即启用开始吃。
As a result of the previous alert, 22 began to eat advance purchase of oseltamivir, a daily preventive model, plus lotus rinderpest capsules are also immediately started to eat.
24日晚上体温继续升高，达到38.5度，明显控制不住了，我把以前买给小孩的美林拿出来喝了一次，20毫升，半小时后体温开始下降，到12点睡觉前是37.2度。
The temperature continued to rise to 38.5 degrees on the night of the 24th, apparently uncontrollably. I took out Merrill Lynch, which I had bought for the baby, and drank it once, 20 milliliters, and in half an hour the body temperature began to drop to 37.2 degrees before bedtime.
25日早上醒来，觉得有点热，测量体温是38度，半小时后又下降到37.6度，感觉良好，除了有点咳和发烧外，没有其他不适症状，精神也很好。
I woke up on the 25th morning feeling a little hot. My temperature was 38 degrees, then it went down to 37.6 degrees in half an hour.
考虑到咳得有点多了，而且有痰，就加服了阿莫西林。
Given that he coughed a little too much and had sputum, he took amoxicillin.
我并非胡乱吃药，也是网上向武汉同济医院医生问诊后，作出在家吃药隔离的决定。
I did not take drugs indiscriminately, but also online to Wuhan Tongji Hospital doctors after the decision to take medicine isolation at home.
第一次就医，医生叫我回家隔离吃药26日晚上，体温再次升高到达38.2度，服用退烧药后稍微下降了一点，但在反复发热的情况下，我不能再继续在家里了，为了让家人安心，明知道医院很危险，我也不得不去了。
The first time I went to the doctor, the doctor told me to go home and take the pills. On the night of the 26th, my temperature rose again to 38.2 degrees. After taking the antipyretics, I couldn't stay at home anymore.
我按照政府发布的流程：首先联系社区，无人应答，联系社区医院，无人应答，联系发布的区联系电话，占线。
I followed a process released by the Government: first contact the community, no response, contact the community hospital, no response, contact the area contact number posted, busy lines.
半小时后社区回话：下班了！社区医院也下班了！我简直不敢相信我的耳朵，都什么时候了，怎么会下班？没人值班吗？好在终于打通了区里公布的咨询电话，告知了定点医院汉口医院的一位主任的电话，经过咨询得知，我可以自己去医院看发热门诊，考虑到发热两天以上，而且咳，建议尽快去。
Half an hour later the community replied: Off work! The community hospital is off work! I can't believe my ears, when, how come off work? No one is on duty?
为了防止交叉感染，考虑再三，我决定走过去，距离大约3.5公里，不算很远，走路不到1小时；二来已经在家多日没有出门的我，也想出去走走。
To prevent cross-infection, I decided to walk three and a half kilometers away, not too far, less than an hour's walk. Second, I had been at home for many days and wanted to go out for a walk.
26日晚上8点40左右，我出门了，戴上9132口罩、眼镜，头上戴了一个一次性的浴帽，脚上鞋子外面套上鞋套，戴好医用手套，全副武装出门去。
At around 8: 40 p.m. on the 26th, I went out, wearing 9132 masks, glasses, a disposable bathrobe on my head, shoes with shoe covers on the outside, medical gloves, and went out heavily armed.
路上只有零星几个人，除了来回跑的救护车和少量私家车，整个城市一片寂静。
There were only a few people on the road, and the city was quiet except for ambulances and a small number of private cars.
真的难以想象，这就是我生活了40多年的城市，一个1000多万人的大都市，说实话，我的心真的在滴血。
It is hard to imagine that this is the city where I have lived for more than 40 years, a metropolis of more than 10 million people.
虽然平时各种吐槽，可是当危机真的来临的时候，谁不爱自己的故乡呢？万先生第一次就诊的医院寒风中走了接近一个小时，进入医院大楼前，看见有人在哭，心中一紧，走进门诊大厅，听见一个婆婆打电话，这里刚刚死了一个。
Although the usual spit, but when the crisis really came, who did not love their hometown? Mr. Wan first saw the hospital in the cold wind for nearly an hour, entered the hospital building, saw someone crying, a tight heart, into the outpatient hall, heard a mother-in-law call, here just died.
依照程序，先挂号，再测氧饱和，一般人氧饱和都是93-99，不知道为什么那个机器测我是100。
According to the procedure, first registered, oxygen saturation, the general oxygen saturation is 93-99, I do not know why that machine I was 100.
我后面又来了一个女的，走路也走不动，大约30多岁，明显状态不好，氧饱和只有81，护士赶紧叫人来扶进抢救室了，后面又来了一个孕妇，老公和父亲一起来的，氧饱和88，明显不妙，也进去了。
A woman came up behind me, unable to walk, in her mid-thirties, apparently in a bad condition, with oxygen saturation of only 81. The nurse quickly called someone into the emergency room, followed by a pregnant woman whose husband and father had come together, saturated with oxygen 88, apparently in bad condition.
经过前面多天的混乱，政府疏导后医院人不像之前那么多了，排队的大概就是30人不到，等待大约2小时，我老老实实地去诊室门口再排队等候。
After days of chaos, hospitals are not as crowded as they used to be, queuing up for less than 30 people and waiting for about two hours.
医生开了检查单，查血，加做CT。
The doctor made a checklist, blood tests, and a CT scan.
12点整，所有检查结束，等待结果。
12: 00. All inspections are complete. Wait for the results.
27日凌晨1点，我先去拿了CT报告，左上肺见少许斑点状模糊影，我心里有数了，这就是肺炎，只不过并不严重。
On the 27th, at 1: 00 a.m., I went to get a CT report, the left upper lung to see a little blurring, I know, this is pneumonia, but not serious.
查血结果就更明确，所有已知病毒全部阴性，除了新型冠状病毒没有检测。
The blood test results are clearer, all known viruses are negative, with the exception of the new coronavirus detection.
跑去医生那里，医生说我是疑似病例，但是现在做不了检测，好在状况也不重，叫回家自己隔离、吃药。
Running to the doctor, the doctor said I was a suspected case, but now can not do the test, but fortunately the condition is not serious, call home their isolation, take medicine.
走出医院一段距离后，扔掉浴帽，手套、鞋套、口罩全部换新的，信心满满走回家。
Out of the hospital some distance, throw away the bathrobe, gloves, shoe cover, mask all new, full of confidence walk home.
进门之前脱下外套和外裤，全部喷洒消毒液后扔掉，里面衣物用消毒水浸泡清洗消毒，乖乖地再次进卧室隔离。
Take off your coat and panties before you come in, spray all the disinfectant and throw them away. Soak them in disinfectant water and disinfect them.
幸运住院，但妈妈和老婆都发烧了1月27日开始，我就自己隔离在家吃药。
Luckily hospitalized, but my mother and wife were both feverish from Jan. 27, and I kept myself isolated at home to take medication.
除了医院开的西药，我还吃了朋友开的中药。
In addition to the Western medicine prescribed by the hospital, I also ate Chinese medicine prescribed by my friends.
但是体温一阵高一阵低，整个人就像在海浪中一样。
But the temperature went up and down, and the whole body was in the waves.
我从来不吃鸡，但为了恢复，强忍着恶心吃了几口鸡汤面，但吃啥吐啥，边吃边吐。
I never eat chicken, but in order to recover, forced a few mouthfuls of chicken soup noodle, but what to eat, eat and vomit.
到了1月30日，病情一直没有好转。
By 30 January, the situation had not improved.
听说协和医院西区开了新病区，有700张床位，我想冒险一试。
I heard that the Western District of Concorde Hospital had opened a new 700 bed area and I wanted to take a chance.
武汉全市禁行，但在一线生机面前这些都不是事。
Wuhan city banned, but in front of a glimmer of vitality these are not things.
我拖着病体开了几十公里过去，靠近医院的地方被警察拦住了，我没有通行证，而且发烧，不许过去，无奈之下只好返回。
I dragged the patient for dozens of kilometres and was stopped by the police near the hospital. I had no pass and had a fever, so I had to return.
但好消息是回家后发现体温稍微下来一点，只有37.3度，不幸中的大幸。
But the good news is that when I got home, my temperature dropped a little, to 37.3 degrees.
我回家后，休息了一下午，5点左右听到一个消息，说武汉市中心医院新开了一个病区，我立马赶去，还剩最后一个，医院把我收进去了。
After I went home, I had a rest all afternoon, and at about 5 o'clock I heard some news that a new sick area had been opened in Wuhan Central Hospital.
从1月31日开始，我的病情加重。
Beginning on 31 January, I became seriously ill.
31日迷迷糊糊睡到2点多，突然肺部剧痛，醒过来。
On the 31st, I slept in a daze until 2 o'clock. Suddenly my lungs ached and woke up.
虽然住进医院，但是医生还没有开任何医嘱。
Though admitted to the hospital, the doctor has not prescribed any medical advice.
在此之前，我除了好好休息保存体力外，也没什么好做的。
Until then, I have nothing to do but rest and preserve my strength.
前一天晚上老婆给我打电话，说孩子可能也在发烧了，我的心都要碎了。
My wife called me the night before and told me that the baby might also have a fever and that my heart was breaking.
为了孩子为了家人，我必须尽快恢复，我坚决不能倒。
For the sake of my children and my family, I must recover as soon as possible.
8点半，病房送来了早餐！原本以为只能靠饼干过日子，居然有吃的。
At 8: 30, the ward delivered breakfast! I thought I had to live on biscuits, but I had food.
一个已经放凉了的菜肉包，一碗稀粥，一个煮鸡蛋，虽然一直想吐，但我只花了几分钟就吞下去了。
A cold dish of meat, a bowl of porridge, and a boiled egg, which I had been trying to spit, but which I swallowed in just a few minutes.
一来因为我确实很饿，二来我的口鼻在外面暴露的时间越长越危险，三是因为我知道，我必须吃，只有吃才有力气和病毒打仗，家里人还等着我回去，我还要去救她们，我不能倒下。
First, because I was really hungry; secondly, because my nose and mouth were exposed longer and more dangerously; thirdly, because I knew that I had to eat, that I had the strength to fight the virus, that my family was waiting for me to return, that I would go to save them, and that I could not fall.
想到这里，我又不争气地哭了，我这四十多岁老爷们，最近一个多星期，特别容易哭，哭的次数比过去几十年都还要多，丢人……发烧第7天，医生给我扎了留置针，开始输第一瓶药，据说病人太多，药供应紧张，不能及时到位。
At the thought of this, I wept again, my fortysomething gentlemen, who, for more than a week, have been crying more often than in past decades, disgracefully sobbing... On the seventh day of my fever, the doctor put a lien on me and began to administer the first bottle of medicine.
我妈早上5点多出门，走了一个多小时到医院，排队两个小时做上了检查，双肺感染，属于高度疑似病例，目前正在打针，我好难过。
My mother went out at 5am, walked more than an hour to the hospital, queued up for two hours to have a check-up, two-lung infection, is a highly suspicious case, is now injection, I am very sad.
可怜老太太70多岁，前年肾脏长了9厘米大的肿瘤做了切除手术，却为了保命不得不自己走几公里看病。
The poor old lady was in her 70s and had a 9 cm tumor in her kidneys the year before. She had to walk several kilometers to save her life.
老婆情况也不好，连续多天发烧38度多，我觉得她的肺也感染了，但因为没有人能接走孩子，她只能在家硬扛。
My wife was in bad shape, running a fever for more than 38 degrees in a row, and I thought her lungs were infected, but since no one could take the baby, she had to carry it at home.
我恨不得马上就病好了回家替她，我们家，一个都不能少！这几天我也经常在思考，我最担心谁。
I would like to be home to replace her soon, our family, not less than one! These days I often think, I worry about who.
我发现还是我闺女，我是不是有点自私了。
I found out that it was my daughter. I was a little selfish.
闺女9岁多了，从她出生起，我就推掉了所有工作，全心在家里照顾她，第一次喂奶，第一次换尿不湿，第一次洗澡，第一次说话，第一次走路，第一次……太多太多了，我都在身边陪伴。
From the moment she was born, I pushed all my work away from her, nursed her for the first time, changed my urine for the first time, bathed for the first time, talked for the first time, walked for the first time... too much for me.
却没想到这次生病到现在，足足8天了，没有见过孩子，哎，我又想哭了，不争气……挺过最凶险的阶段1月31日那天我听护士说，医院里第一批救治病人的医生护士，很多都住院了，他们的防护服不够，质量也不够好。
I didn't expect to see a child for eight days now, but by the way, I wanted to cry again and survive the most dangerous phase January 31I heard from the nurse that many of the first doctors and nurses in the hospital who had treated their patients were hospitalized and their suits were inadequate and of poor quality.
挽救我生命的武汉市中心医院的医护人员，这个恩情我永远记得，没齿难忘。
Save my life of Wuhan City Central Hospital medical personnel, this gratitude I will always remember, unforgettable.
为众人抱薪者，不可使其倒毙于风雪……万先生在武汉市中心住院时拍到的护士背影住院第三天，我的体温始终保持着上午37.7，下午38.5的样子，喉咙痛的症状明显减轻，但是咳得太厉害了，整个腹肌到胸骨都在痛，会影响吃饭，每吃一口饭，足足要疼上一分多钟，痛到几乎无法呼吸，真是拼尽全力的吃。
On the third day of hospitalization, my body temperature remained at 37.7 a.m. and 38.5 p.m. The symptoms of sore throat were markedly alleviated, but the cough was so severe that the whole abdominal muscle to the sternum ached, causing pain for more than a minute for every bite, and the pain was almost impossible to breathe.
老天爷，希望这个阶段尽快过去，要不我会疯的。
God, I hope this stage is over as soon as possible, or I'll be crazy.
好消息是老婆这天打电话说不发烧了，体温36.2，再继续保持3天，她就扛过去了。
The good news is that the wife called that day to say no fever, temperature 36.2, and continue to maintain three days, she carried it.
闺女体温正常，没想到我们家最弱的两人，却是恢复最快的。
Daughter body temperature is normal, did not expect our family the weakest two, but the fastest recovery.
母亲已经到隔离观察点去了。
Mother has gone to the quarantined spot.
发烧的第十天，体温保持得非常好，血氧饱和度也很好，一切都在向好的方向发展。
On the tenth day of fever, the temperature remains very good, the oxygen saturation of the blood is very good, everything is developing in a good direction.
不过我清楚地知道，必须要等激素停用后，我还是不发烧，那才是真的过关。
But I knew very well that I had to wait for the hormone to stop, I still do not have a fever, that is true clearance.
听医生说，我即将被转入火神山医院，中国最好的军医都到了，我出院回家不过就是时间问题。
I was about to be transferred to Mount Huoshen Hospital. The best Chinese doctor was here. It was just a matter of time before I was discharged from the hospital.
那天让我觉得最开心的事，其实还不是去火神山，而是帮助武汉市中心医院因为救治病患而感染的医护人员申请了救助金。
That day let me feel the happiest thing, in fact, is not to go to Mount Fujimori, but to help Wuhan City Central Hospital for patients infected by the medical personnel applied for grants.
他们用命在救人，无论什么样的奖励，我觉得都不过分，他们很多都非常年轻，有的甚至20岁刚出头，其实还是个孩子。
They use their lives to save people, and I can't overdo it with any kind of reward. Many of them are very young, some are in their early 20s and are actually children.
能力有限，但是我想，最起码，要让他们下班了有口热饭吃，再也不想他们吃泡面了。
Their abilities are limited, but I think, at the very least, let them have a hot meal after work, and never want them to eat noodles again.
听到李医生去世的消息，我很难过，之前住院的医院就是他工作的地方。
I was sorry to hear that Dr. Li had died. The hospital where he was previously hospitalized was where he worked.
好在国家监委去调查了，虽然知道为时已晚，但是亡羊补牢，李医生会听见的。
Fortunately, the NNSC went to investigate, knowing that it was too late, but he would have heard.
有个事情，我觉得想说一下，对不对请大家思考。
There's one thing I think I'd like to say, right? Please think about it.
李医生被警察训诫，这个不假，但是警察不是专业人士，特别是作为派出所的民警，不过是执行他们的任务，就不要骂警察了。
It was true that Dr. Lee had been reprimanded by the police, but the police were not professionals, especially as police officers in police stations, but simply carried out their duties and did not abuse the police.
特别是我这种有孩子的人，从来都是教育孩子，有困难找警察叔叔，警察和医生是两个崇高的职业，对于孩子来说，都是安全的保证。
Especially for people like me, who always educate their children and have trouble finding a police uncle, a policeman and a doctor are two lofty professions, and for children it is a guarantee of safety.
我想，这个道理需要讲清。
I think that needs to be made clear.
我没有单纯的为任何人说话，我只是希望分清责任，不要见人就喷。
I do not speak for anyone, I just want to distinguish between the responsibility, do not see people spray.
争取从火神山医院第一批出院到火神山医院的第四天，我的状态越来越好了，连护士看到我都说，你比刚来的时候好多了。
By the fourth day after I was discharged from the Mount Fire Hospital to Mount Fire Hospital, I was getting better and better. Even the nurses saw me and said, You're much better than when you first came.
哎，亏我还以为自己来的时候不喘，现在看看前几天的视频，简直不敢想象。
Well, I thought I wasn't panting when I came, and now I can't imagine looking at the videos of the last few days.
到火神山医院后我拍了视频发在网上，引得很多记者来采访我。
After arriving at the Mount Fire Hospital, I made a video and posted it on the Internet, attracting many journalists to interview me.
火神山医院条件真的不错，两人一间，有空调，拖鞋都是新的。
The condition of Fosen Mountain Hospital is really good, two room, air conditioning, slippers are new.
和我一间的是位老人，老人家情况严重一些。
In my room was an old man whose condition was more serious.
我写文章、拍视频不是为别的，我的目的很简单，就是告诉大家，这个病真的可以治疗，我想给所有人信心。
I didn't write the article, I made the video for no other reason, my purpose is very simple, is to tell you, this disease can be really treatable, I want to give everyone confidence.
我以前参与很多财经节目录制，所以拍视频我很习惯。
I used to be involved in a lot of financial programming, so I'm used to making videos.
不过后来医生们说我拍视频让他们有压力，我答应不拍了，你看到的都是之前拍的。
But then the doctors said I was putting pressure on them to make a video, and I said no, you saw it all before.
我答应了医生，不能食言。
I promised the doctor not to break my word.
我现在最大的希望，是成为火神山医院第一批出院的痊愈病人，我想让大家看到病毒很凶猛，但是不必惊慌。
My greatest hope now is to be the first to be discharged from Mount Fire Hospital. I want you to see that the virus is very fierce, but don't be alarmed.
大家不要恐慌，没事的。
Don't panic, everybody. It's okay.
我是一个写财经文章的，本来传染病这种事情和我八杆子也打不着，可事情就是这么魔幻。
I am a financial article, originally infectious diseases and I can not play eight strokes, but this is the magic.
武汉东湖樱花园　图｜网络等我出去，我会向大家展示，我的家乡武汉有多美。
