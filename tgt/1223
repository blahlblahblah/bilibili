2020年的这个春节，对吕乔来说格外重要。
The Spring Festival in 2020 is especially important to Lucho.
这是她和丈夫在湖北襄阳买房定居，拥有属于自己小家的第一个年头。
It was the first year she and her husband had settled in Xiangyang, Hubei Province.
因为当地的习俗，新房第一年，吕乔要把爸爸妈妈、公公婆婆全部接来，和他们一家三口一起过年，象征着往后的日子红红火火。
Because of the local custom, the first year of the new house, Lujiao will parents, parents-in-law, and their family together to celebrate the New Year, a symbol of the future red hot days.
意料之外的疫情局面日益严峻之后，吕乔有时会庆幸这个习俗，在逐渐逼近的疫情危机、在“封城”“封路”之前，把最牵挂的人们都聚集到自己身边。
After the unexpected severity of the epidemic, Lucho sometimes celebrated the custom of gathering the people most concerned around him before the looming crisis of the epidemic and the closure of the city.
联系上吕乔时，她所在的民政系统只留下必须的工作人员值班。
When she was contacted, her civil administration left only the necessary staff on duty.
敲定采访时间，她说“都可以，反正现在都在家里没什么事”。
Finish the interview time, she said "all right, anyway, there is nothing at home now."
但在疫情笼罩之下，作为操持七口之家的女主人，吕乔依旧有很多的事情要忙。
But under the shadow of the epidemic, as the hostess of a family of seven, Lujiao still has a lot of work to do.
再次联系到她时，她刚刚结束一次“快去快回”的生活物资采购。
By the time she was contacted again, she had just finished a quick-go-fast-go shopping.
从除夕到现在，她和丈夫作为家庭采购代表一共出门三次，尽量速战速决，每次都在小区附近的超市解决。
From New Year's Eve to the present, she and her husband as the family procurement representative out three times, try to speed up the battle, each time in the neighborhood near the supermarket to solve.
只有这次，为了给家里两岁的孩子采购尿不湿，才选择去小区外面“武商大”里的大超市。
Only this time, in order to the two-year-old children to purchase urine not wet, just choose to go outside the "Wuchang University" in the large supermarket.
出门三次，吕乔和丈夫都能逐渐感到“越来越严峻了”。
Three trips away, Lu Qiao and her husband can gradually feel "more and more serious."
街上的人行色匆匆、超市里的人和他们一样都尽快采购、100%的口罩佩戴率……到了这次出门，小区出口已经安排了登记，并且告知明天起不再能随意进出；超市门口也有专门的体温检测，结果正常才放行。
The people in the street were in a hurry, the people in the supermarket were shopping as fast as they were, 100% of the masks were wearing... By this time, the exit of the neighborhood had been registered and had been told that they would not be allowed in or out again tomorrow.
措施日益严格，紧张的情绪也在蔓延。
The measures are becoming more stringent and tensions are spreading.
但吕乔反而渐渐感到一丝安心。
But gradually Lu Qiao felt a little relieved.
经历了疫情之初的惶恐和说服家人重视的心力交瘁，普通市民吕乔没有办法做更多“伟大”的事，作为妻子、女儿、母亲，她只能尽力维护家人的健康周全，再努力创造一些缝隙里的快乐。
After the panic of the outbreak and the fatigue of persuading her family to take her seriously, Lu Qiao, an ordinary citizen, couldn't do more "great" things. As a wife, daughter and mother, she could only try to keep her family healthy and try to create some happiness in the cracks.
吕乔的回复常常很慢。
Lucho's replies were often slow.
在挤牙膏一样的字句背后，是忙乱的照顾孩子、做饭……生活在湖北的吕乔是被疫情砸中的“倒霉版我们”，但她又足够警觉而幸运，全家健康。
Behind the words like squeezing toothpaste, there was the rush to take care of the children and cook... Lujiao, who lived in Hubei province, was the "hapless version of us" hit by the epidemic, but she was alert and lucky enough to keep the family healthy.
在暴风眼的宁静里，吕乔一家带我们看到了疫情之下的另一个侧面：反思、警惕，以及在灾难里努力经营生活的勇气。
In the calm of the eye of the storm, the Lucho family showed us another aspect of the epidemic: reflection, vigilance, and the courage to manage life in a disaster.
曾经“野味”是寻常1月17日，新闻里首次爆出肺炎疫情时，经常关注新闻报道的吕乔还和同事轻松地讨论。
Once Wild Game On January 17, when pneumonia was first reported on the news, Lu Qiao, who often follows the news, had a light discussion with his colleagues.
同事从汉口火车站回来，有点咳嗽，吕乔还打趣她说“不会你也传染上了吧”。
My colleague came back from Hankou railway station and coughed a little. Lu joked, "You won't catch it, either."
这个一晃而过的“热点”连谈资都算不上，没有人过分在意。
This passing "hot spot" is not even talking about the matter, no one is too concerned.
四天之后的21日，当吕乔从襄阳保康接父母回到襄阳市区时，她忽然意识到了疫情的严峻，“口罩脱销了”。
Four days later, on the 21st, when she returned to Xiangyang from Xiangyang to pick up her parents, she suddenly realized the severity of the epidemic.
重金难求的口罩仿佛是个信号。
A mask that is hard to get is a sign.
吕乔和同事们到处买口罩，但很多地方都没有了，小区门口的药房则规定限购。
Lucho and her colleagues shop around for masks, but many are gone, and pharmacies in front of the neighborhood limit their purchases.
吕乔记得一个很深刻的对比：22日晚上，她出门去鼓楼北街——襄阳最繁华的街道，只有一半以上的人戴了口罩；到了23日，她去顾客不多的小区超市购物，十个人中便只有一两个没戴口罩了。
On the evening of the 22nd, she went out to Gulou North Street, the most prosperous street in Xiangyang, and more than half of the people wore masks. On the 23rd, she went to the supermarket in a small neighborhood where only one or two out of ten people were wearing masks.
这个变化令吕乔更加警觉。
This change made Luciao more alert.
她开始劝说家人都戴上口罩、重视疫情，甚至希望有武汉接触史、要带野味狗獾子来尝鲜的公公婆婆不要来了。
She began to persuade the family to wear masks, attach importance to the epidemic, and even hope that Wuhan contact history, to bring game dog badger children to taste fresh do not come.
但家人们依旧不以为然。
But the family still disagrees.
吕乔老家住在神农架附近的山里，家族里向来有打野味、吃野味的传统，那些真正“从山里到餐桌”直接猎来的野味，在老家常被作为最好的食物用来招待客人。
Lu Qiao, who lives in the mountains near Shennongjia, has a tradition of bushmeat and game-eating. The game, which is hunted directly from the mountains to the table, is often used as the best food for guests at home.
腊月二十六（1月20日），吕乔去山里的伯伯家吃饭时，曾做过猎人的伯伯还特意买了一只麂子招待她。
On the 26th of January, when Luciao went to dine at his uncle's in the mountains, his uncle, a former hunter, bought her a suede.
寻常的野味在疫情之下变得狰狞。
The common game became ferocious under the epidemic.
吕乔很焦虑，一边劝说家人不要吃野味、戴口罩，一边忧心忡忡地担心公公婆婆的身体。
Lu Qiao was very anxious, while persuading his family not to eat game, wearing masks, while worrying about her father-in-law's body.
在疫情舆论笼罩全国之前，警觉的吕乔度过了心力交瘁的节前日子。
Before the outbreak of public opinion hung over the country, the alert Lujiao spent the rest of his life.
“感觉所有担子都在我一个人身上”，因为每天唠叨疫情、在新闻报道远未覆盖之前就不断提醒家人消毒、洗手，吕乔的丈夫觉得她很烦，两人一度闹得很不愉快。
"It felt like I was alone" because of the daily nagging, constant reminders to family members to disinfect and wash their hands long before the news was even covered, and her husband found her annoying and they had a rough time.
吕乔的妈妈更是很坚决：“我懒得戴口罩！”只有一个人在乎的家庭防疫毫无意义，吕乔感到崩溃。
Lu Qiao's mother is very determined: "I am too lazy to wear masks!" Only one person care about the family immunization meaningless, Lujiao felt collapse.
幸好，随着新闻报道铺天盖地的提醒与疫情事实的升级，加上她不间断地努力劝说，家人们终于开始逐渐重视起来。
Thankfully, as the news spread and the facts of the epidemic escalated, and as she worked tirelessly to persuade them, families began to take notice.
吕乔家的团年饭。
The Lunar New Year dinner for the Luciao family.
彼时她还在焦虑家人的身体状态，好在有惊无险春节时，吕乔和表哥通话，表哥说别人送了他一个麂子腿，因为看到新闻中关于野味病毒的报道，表哥赶紧扔掉了这个曾经很是“宝贝”的野味。
At that time she was still worried about her family's health. Luckily, during the Spring Festival holiday, Lu Qiao spoke to her cousin, who said he had been given a suede leg because he had lost the once-precious game because of news reports of game viruses.
“年轻人的接受程度可能更好，但年纪大了还是不容易改变。
"Young people may be more receptive, but they may not change easily as they get older.
”吕乔把表哥扔掉麂子腿的事情跟妈妈讲，妈妈觉得“特别可惜”，而更固执的公公则依旧坚信，病毒是“美国的生化武器”，是“坏得很的美国鬼子”引爆了这场危机。
Lu told his mother about his cousin's throwing away his chamois legs, a "particular pity" for his mother, while the more obstinate father-in-law remained adamant that the virus was an "American biological weapon" and that the "bad American devil" had triggered the crisis.
一家人因为疫情朝夕相处，吕乔不愿过多争辩。
Lu didn't want to argue too much because the family was living with an epidemic.
随着新闻报道比例的增加、管控措施的逐渐严密，固执的老人们虽然不惧野味，但对“会传染给家人”格外在意，也渐渐感到后怕。
With the increase in the proportion of news coverage, control measures gradually tight, stubborn old people although not afraid of game, but "will infect their families" extra care, but gradually fear.
在疫情笼罩的大环境里，感冒了的公公开始主动每天测体温、在家里也戴着口罩。
In the general environment of the epidemic, cold father-in-law began to take the initiative to take daily temperature, at home also wearing a mask.
“他们觉得害怕了，也知道不出门了”，吕乔的妈妈有时想要出门到小区走走，不等吕乔反对，公公就会首先劝说她“不让出门就不出门”。
"They feel afraid and know not to go out," Lu Qiao's mother sometimes want to go out to the community, not waiting for Lu Qiao to object, father-in-law will first persuade her "do not go out or stay out.
暴风眼的宁静春节以来，湖北疫情日益严峻，确诊人数也在不断攀升。
Since the quiet Spring Festival of storm eyes, the number of confirmed cases has been increasing in Hubei province.
但暴风眼中的吕乔，反而比之前安心了许多。
But in the eye of the storm, Lu Qiao was more relieved than before.
“之前比较焦虑，主要是因为家人不重视。
"I was worried because my family didn't care.
现在他们都开始害怕了，我反而放心了。
Now that they were all beginning to fear, I was relieved.
”这个提防着病毒、没办法出门的新年，打破了很多“计划”。
The new year, wary of viruses and unable to go out, broke many "plans."
吕乔说起，很多同事早早买好了回老家的车票与年礼，但因为担心传染，最终放弃；自己和丈夫本来打算开车带着父母去西安自驾旅行，如今也泡汤了，只能在疫情还没严重之前，挑一个没有人的公园，戴好口罩，陪着不常来市里的父母匆忙走一走。
Many colleagues bought tickets and New Year's presents back home early, but they gave up for fear of catching the infection. They and their husband, who were driving their parents to Xi'an, had gone down the drain, choosing a deserted park and wearing masks to accompany their parents, who had come infrequently, before the outbreak became serious.
但吕乔依旧在努力经营。
But Lujiao is still trying to run the business.
毕竟，这是一次非常难得地、一个真正“团圆”的年。
After all, it was a rare year, a year of true "reunion."
“往年说是团圆过年，但实际上都在走亲戚、串门、互相盘问比较，留给至亲的时间反而最少。
"It used to be said that we were reunited for the New Year, but in fact we all went to relatives, visited each other and cross-examined each other.
”这段突如其来的空白时间，吕乔一家和父母、公婆都留在家里，大家一起包饺子、一起照顾宝宝，一起追一部剧。
"The family stayed at home with their parents and parents-in-law to make dumplings, take care of the baby and play a play together.
吕乔的妈妈和婆婆会一起做家务，各自做不同喜欢吃的菜；爸爸和公公会帮忙洗碗，老人们还会带着吕乔的女儿一起在屋里跳广场舞，是特殊时期里别样的温馨。
Lu Qiao's mother and mother-in-law will do housework, each do different favorite dishes; father and father-in-law will help wash dishes, old people will also take Lucho's daughter to dance in the house square dance, is a special time of special warmth.
吕乔一家人合力包好的饺子大年初七那天，是吕乔女儿的两岁生日。
Lu Qiao's family joined forces to wrap up dumplings on the seventh day of the New Year, Lu Qiao's daughter's second birthday.
她本来想买个蛋糕为女儿庆祝，但是疫情之下，蛋糕店纷纷关门，到底还是没能买到。
She wanted to buy a cake to celebrate her daughter's death, but because of the outbreak, the bakery was closed.
但好在全家人齐聚，身体健康，可以一起对她说生日快乐，把陪伴、祝福与祈盼都给她。
Fortunately, the family gathered together, healthy, can say happy birthday to her, the company, blessing and pray to her.
没有蛋糕，吕乔就用抖音为她拍了个生日视频，用软件里的蛋糕特效填补真实世界里的遗憾。
Without cake, Lu took a birthday video for her with a quiver, filling her real-world regret with the cake effects in the software.
不成行的旅行、没吃到的蛋糕都可以之后再补，只要家人平安健康，吕乔就心满意足。
No trip, no cake can be filled after the trip, as long as the family members are safe and healthy, Lucho will be satisfied.
女儿学会的新词——口罩2月1日，黄冈发布通知，每户家庭每两天可指派1名家庭成员上街采购生活物资，其他人员除生病就医、疫情防控工作需要、在商超和药店上班外，不得外出。
Families can assign one family member to the streets every two days to purchase household supplies, while others will not be allowed to go out except for medical treatment, epidemic prevention and control, and work outside stores and pharmacies, Huanggang said on Feb. 1.
黄冈有了“出行管控”，襄阳不知道会不会更加严格。
Huanggang has "travel control", Xiangyang does not know if it will be more stringent.
但面对接下来不知何时结束的封闭生活，吕乔还是很有信心，因为一家人始终在一起。
But in the face of the next unknown when the end of the closed life, Lu Qiao is very confident, because the family always together.
“在危难时刻，只有家人才是最重要的，家人在一起会让你有勇气面对接下来的困难！不管如何，我们都将一起面对！”小区封闭之后，依靠附近的超市，可以买到除了“珍贵”消毒用品以外的生活物资维持基本生活，“再撑一个月没有问题”。
"In times of crisis, only the family is the most important, family together will give you the courage to face the next difficulties! Either way, we will face it together!
让吕乔更担心的反而是农村老家的情况。
What worries Lu Qiao more is the situation in the rural hometown instead.
留守在农村的老人们本就有根深蒂固的“拜年串门”传统，就算关系不是特别好的人，过年也一定要去别人家里坐坐，拜年喝茶，不去会被视为彼此有意见。
Even if the relationship is not particularly good, people must visit other people's homes for tea in the New Year and it will be regarded as a mutual opinion not to go there.
再加上老人们不会上网，重视程度恐怕会更不够。
Plus, the elderly people do not have access to the Internet, I am afraid the degree of attention will be less.
返乡的年轻人都是在外务工人员，拜年习俗和“一年一次”的团聚机会更是不断增加传染概率。
Returning young people are migrant workers, and New Year's Eve visits and "once a year" reunions are increasing the probability of infection.
网络上那些广受关注的“硬核村长喊话”、暴力毁路封路，在吕乔的了解里收效甚微，难以撼动熟人社会的“年俗”根基。
The network of the "hard core village chief shouting", violent destruction of the road closure, in Lujiao's understanding of little effect, hard to shake the acquaintances' "vulgar" foundation.
“我们村也有开车放喇叭宣传，也有封路的情况，但是据我所知，还是有一些亲友仍在串门，重视不够。
"Our village also has motoring campaigns and road closures, but to my knowledge some friends and relatives are still visiting the house and not paying enough attention to them.
”宣传之外，农村的物资更是大问题。
Beyond propaganda, rural goods are a big problem.
村民平时不可能在家中存有备用的口罩，如今这样的形势，老家偏远，村民们更是不可能买到口罩，村干部到处募集，在城市生活的吕乔口罩储量也日益告急，爱莫能助。
Villagers are unlikely to have spare masks in their homes, even in remote villages, where it is impossible for villagers to buy masks, and where village officials are raising money for masks, the stocks of Lujiao masks that live in the city are running out of steam.
“我希望能有物资支援农村地区。
"I hope there will be supplies to support the countryside.
”吕乔希望政府能更加重视农村地区的防疫，从宣传力度到物资储备，吕乔渴望老家的乡亲们不只有大喇叭的徒劳喊话，也能有政府科学的防疫指导、有干净的口罩保护自己。
Lu hoped the government would pay more attention to epidemic prevention in rural areas, from publicity efforts to supplies, and that Lu Qiao longed for villagers back home not only to shout vainly but also to have government scientific guidance on epidemic prevention and clean masks to protect themselves.
吕乔两岁的女儿最近也学会了这个新词——“口罩”。
Lu's two-year-old daughter recently learned the new word, "mask."
牙牙学语的年纪，本该以一些更美好的事物开场，去认识这个世界。
The age of tooth language, should start with something better, to understand the world.
但这个特殊的、没办法走在阳光下的春节，小朋友要和父母长辈一起都戴上“口罩”，要听着他们讨论“口罩”的重要与紧俏，以这样的方式认识它。
But this special, can not walk in the sun's Spring Festival, children and parents should wear "masks", to listen to them discuss the importance of "face masks", in this way to know it.
疫情之下的封闭生活让平日忙碌的爸爸有了更多时间陪伴孩子但吕乔不愿意把这件事想得太过沉重，她更愿意尽可能平淡地看待它，看待这场疫情，也看待可见和不可见的危机。
The containment of the epidemic has given the normally busy father more time to spend with his children, but Lucho did not want to think too much about it, preferring to see it as bland as possible, the epidemic and the visible and the invisible.
“没有特意去教，就学会说新事物了，真是好聪明的宝宝！”顺着吕乔的思路，我也第一次跳出疫情肆虐以来的“悲伤逻辑”，去单纯夸奖一个孩子的“语言学习”。
"It's so smart to learn to say new things without going out of my way to teach!" For the first time, I jumped out of the "sad logic" of the epidemic to praise a child's "language learning" for the first time.
“谢谢！”这一次，吕乔回复得很快。
"Thank you!" This time, Lu Qiao replied quickly.
她发来他们的全家福，照片里，刚刚学会说“口罩”的小朋友被正在为她剥桔子的爸爸圈在怀里，眼神澄澈地看着镜头。
She sent in a family photo of a child who had just learned to say "mask" and who was wrapping her orange-peeling dad in his arms, looking at the camera with clear eyes.
吕乔很确定，她的女儿将学会更多事物的名字，也能很快地走在春天里。
Luciao was sure that her daughter would learn more things by name and would soon be able to walk in the spring.
