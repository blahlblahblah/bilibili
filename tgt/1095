大范围推广仍需进一步临床试验的评估2月13日晚，在湖北省新冠疫情新闻发布会上，武汉市金银潭医院院长张定宇表示，康复后的患者体内有大量的中和抗体来抵抗新冠病毒。
On the night of Feb. 13, Zhang Dingyu, director of Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital, said recovering patients had plenty of neutralizing antibodies to fight the new crown virus.
他呼吁康复期患者捐献血浆，共同拯救还在与病魔作斗争的病人。
He called on convalescent patients to donate blood plasma to save patients struggling with the disease.
与此同时，中国医药集团下属公司中国生物也宣布：在新冠肺炎康复者血浆中已检测出高效价病毒中和抗体，实验证明，能够有效杀死新冠病毒。
Meanwhile, China Biology, a subsidiary of the China Pharmaceutical Group, also announced that highly effective price-neutral antibodies had been detected in plasma of patients recovering from New Crown Pneumonia, which proved to be effective in killing the new crown virus.
中国生物说，“我们用康复者特异血浆临床治疗11例危重病人，治疗效果显著。
"We used specific plasma from convalescent patients to treat 11 critically ill patients with remarkable therapeutic effect," said Chinese biologist.
”据介绍，从1月20日开始，中国生物筹备组建了团队，调集了装备设备及原材料，在武汉地区实施了新冠肺炎康复者血浆采集。
Since January 20, Chinese biology has been preparing to form teams, assemble equipment and raw materials and collect plasma from patients recovering from pneumonia in Wuhan, the newspaper said.
2 月8日，首期在武汉江夏区第一人民医院开展了3名危重患者的新冠特免血浆治疗，目前连同后续医院治疗的危重病人超过了10人。
On February 8, the first round of new plasma-free treatment for three critically ill patients was launched at the First People's Hospital in Jiangxia District, Wuhan, with more than 10 critically ill patients being treated together with follow-up hospitals.
中国生物研发相关负责人表示，新冠病毒特免血浆的采集、制备和系列检测过程，具有良好的安全性，制备工艺成熟，所需时间短。
China's biological research and development, said the new cap virus special plasma collection, preparation and series of testing process, with good security, mature preparation process, the time required.
目前在缺乏疫苗和特效治疗药物的前提下，采用这种特免血浆制品治疗新冠病毒感染是最为有效的方法，可大幅降低危重患者病死率。
At present, in the absence of vaccines and special-effects drugs, this special plasma treatment is the most effective way to significantly reduce the fatality rate of critically ill patients.
《新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎诊疗方案（试行第五版修订版）》提到，有条件时可采用恢复期血浆治疗。
The New Coronavirus Infection Diagnosis and Treatment Programme for Pneumonia (Trial Version 5) mentions that convalescent plasma treatment can be used when possible.
中国医学科学研究院输血医学系的一个研究团队目前正在与武汉血液中心合作开展相关研究。
A research team from the Department of Blood Transfusion Medicine at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences is working with the Wuhan Blood Center.
其中一位研究人员吴越（化名）告诉《中国新闻周刊》，严格地说，血浆抗体目前为止还处于研究阶段，必须有严格的临床研究设计（来证实有效性）。
One of the researchers, Wu Yue (not his real name), told China News Weekly that strictly speaking, plasma antibodies are still in the research stage and must be designed for rigorous clinical studies.
“不能因为已经做了11例或者十几例，就说明这是有效的。
"It doesn't mean it's working because we've done 11 cases or a dozen or so.
”何为血浆治疗？北京朝阳医院副院长、呼吸危重症专家童朝晖2月13日撰文指出，所谓恢复期血浆治疗，指的是采集康复期患者富含抗体的血液后，经过特殊处理再输注给其他患者的一种被动免疫治疗方法。
What is plasma treatment? Writing February 13, Tong Chaohui, vice-president of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital and an expert on respiratory crisis, said the so-called convalescent plasma treatment is a passive immunotherapy that involves the collection of antibody-rich blood from convalescent patients and subsequent transfusion to other patients.
抗体是指机体由于抗原（如病毒）的刺激而产生的具有保护作用的蛋白质，在病毒被清除后，人体内短期内仍具有较高水平的抗体，随着时间的推移而减少。
Antibodies are protective proteins produced by the body as a result of the stimulation of antigens (such as viruses) and remain at relatively high levels in the body in the short term after the virus is removed, and decrease over time.
清华大学药学院首任院长丁胜向《中国新闻周刊》解释说，从理论上来说，一些康复期患者身上如果有足够浓度的有效抗体，将他的血浆输给感染者，如果感染者正处在病毒的致病期，抗体就有可能中和病毒，并起到一个缓解病症的作用。
Ding Shengsheng, the first dean of the Tsinghua University School of Pharmacy, explained to China News Weekly that in theory, some convalescent patients who have enough effective antibodies to pass their plasma to infected people could neutralize the virus and act as a palliative if the infected person is in the virus's pathogenic phase.
这是一种历史悠久的治疗思路，最早可以追溯至1891年。
This is a long history of therapeutic thinking dating back as far back as 1891.
这一年，在柏林大学附属诊疗所的儿科病房，德国医生埃米尔·贝林给一个濒死的白喉病患儿注射了一种血清，这种血清里含有白喉抗毒素。
That year, in the paediatric ward of the University of Berlin clinic, German doctor Emil Behring injected a child with diphtheria near death with a serum containing diphtheria antitoxin.
第二天，患儿的病情明显好转。
The next day, the child's condition improved markedly.
白喉病的抗体疗法成为医学史上一个重要里程碑。
Antibody therapy for diphtheria has become an important milestone in medical history.
然而，在过去的一些大流行病中，针对这种疗法的研究却没有得出确切的结论。
However, in some past pandemics, studies of this therapy have not yielded conclusive results.
2016年，发表在《新英格兰医学杂志》上的一项研究发现，接受500ml恢复期患者的血浆治疗并未改善埃博拉病毒感染患者的生存率。
In 2016, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that plasma therapy in 500 ml convalescent patients did not improve the survival rate of Ebola virus infections.
2019年，《柳叶刀呼吸医学》发表的一项随机双盲三期临床研究显示，高滴度抗流感免疫血浆相比非免疫血浆在治疗重症流感时无显著获益。
In 2019, a randomized double-blind three-phase clinical study published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine showed no significant benefit in treating severe influenza compared with non-immune plasma.
非典期间，北京、香港等地曾使用SARS患者康复期血清成功救治多例危重SARS病人，不过业内专家指出，临床使用这种疗法有一个关键问题，就是即便对常见病原微生物进行了检测，病人恢复期血浆中仍然存在其他未知病原微生物，因此存在血源传播相关疾病的可能。
During SARS, Beijing, Hong Kong and other places successfully treated a number of patients with SARS with their serums during the convalescent period. However, industry experts pointed out that a key problem in the clinical use of SARS was the presence of other unknown pathogenic microorganisms in the patient's convalescent plasma, thus posing a risk of blood-borne-related diseases.
从事传染病控制的解放军302医院姜素椿教授就曾表示，利用SARS康复者产生的血清抗体，帮助杀死危重非典患者体内的SARS病毒，只能是在既无特效药又无疫苗的特殊时期的救命措施。
Professor Jiang Su-chun of the 302 Hospital of the PLA engaged in infectious disease control has said that the use of serum antibodies produced by SARS patients to help kill SARS virus in critically ill SARS patients can only be a life-saving measure during a specific period when there is neither a specific drug nor a vaccine.
前述研究人员吴越则向《中国新闻周刊》解释说，理论上这种思路是没有问题的，但是到目前为止，诸多科学问题依然没有弄清楚。
Wu Yue, a former researcher, explained to China News Weekly that the idea is theoretically sound, but so far many scientific questions remain unclear.
比如，抗体分为保护性抗体和非保护性抗体，乙肝表面抗体是保护性的，但如果一个人的HIV抗体检测为阳性，不代表他对HIV病毒免疫，反而说明此人染上了艾滋病。
For example, antibodies are divided into protective antibodies and non-protective antibodies. Hepatitis B surface antibodies are protective, but if a person is HIV-positive, this does not mean that he is immune to HIV, but rather that the person is infected with AIDS.
而新冠病毒的抗体，国内外的基础研究依然没有足够的证据表明它是保护性抗体。
But the new crown virus antibody, the domestic and foreign basic research still does not have the sufficient evidence that it is the protective antibody.
而中国生物得出了11例有效的结论，也并非来自科学的临床试验。
Chinese organisms came up with 11 valid conclusions, not from scientific clinical trials.
比如，吴越解释，没有对照试验，那么这些重症病人的痊愈是否归功于这个血浆疗法不得而知，“我们知道新冠病毒是自限性的，很多人不治疗也会自己好。
Wu explained, for example, that without controlled trials, it was not clear whether the plasma therapy was responsible for the recovery of these critically ill patients. "We know that the new crown virus is self-limited and many people would be better off without it.
”童朝晖总结认为，在新冠肺炎的治疗中可以经验性试用恢复期血浆治疗，但其大范围推广仍需进一步临床试验的评估。
"Tong concluded that convalescent plasma therapy could be experimentally tried in the treatment of new crown pneumonia, but that its wider application still needs to be evaluated in further clinical trials.
诸多挑战待解吴越认为，对于血浆疗法需要解决的关键问题是，首先要证明这种疗法有效，其次要证明它针对什么样的病人有效，也就是这个疗法的适应症是什么。
Wu Yue believes that the key problem to be solved in plasma therapy is to prove that it works first and, secondly, what kind of patients it is for, that is, what is the indication of the treatment.
比如，目前他们的初步研究就发现，如果病人体内已经有抗体的人，就不适用这种方法，因为可能会引起免疫过激，对病人弊大于利。
For example, their preliminary study so far has found that if a patient already has antibodies in his or her body, this approach is not appropriate, as it may lead to over-immunity and do more harm than good for the patient.
在安全性经得起验证的前提下，康复者血浆治疗法依然面临诸多挑战。
Under the premise that the safety can withstand the verification, the convalescent person's plasma treatment still faces many challenges.
丁胜说，另一个长期更有用的研发策略是从康复患者身上寻找、分离、鉴定这些不同的中和抗体，基于功能最后选出具体的抗体进行后续开发（这样的抗体可以大规模生产），并且可以基于这些高效的中和抗体来设计疫苗。
Another long-term, more useful strategy, Ding says, is to find, isolate, and identify these different neutralizing antibodies from patients who recover, and then select specific antibodies based on their functions for subsequent development (which can be mass-produced), and design vaccines based on these highly effective neutralizing antibodies.
相比之下，直接提取康复期病人的血浆，经处理后来治疗病人，这种方式不大可能大规模推开。
In contrast, the direct extraction of plasma from convalescent patients, who are subsequently treated, is unlikely to be pushed aside on a large scale.
丁胜解释说，主要的原因是治疗性血浆来源有限，不同人身上的抗体也不尽相同，而且活性浓度也不太一样，因而治疗效果会有变化。
The main reason, Ding explains, is that therapeutic plasma comes from limited sources, antibodies vary from person to person, and concentrations of activity are not the same, so treatment effects change.
比如说，有些感染者的自身免疫能力差些，身体没有产生大量的高效中和抗体。
For example, some infected people have less autoimmune ability, and the body does not produce a large number of highly neutralizing antibodies.
而且这种疗法存在风险性，血浆里的其它病原体、细胞因子等物质，如何处理，是比较复杂的。
And this kind of treatment has the risk sex, the plasma other pathogen, the cytokine and so on, how handles, is quite complex.
“最主要的障碍就是来源。
"The main obstacle is the source.
”吴越也表示，因为血浆必须来源于患者的恢复期，什么样的人可以捐献血液？如何保证供者的健康？这都是非常重要的问题。
Wu also said that because plasma must come from the patient's recovery period, who can donate blood and how to ensure the donor's health?
