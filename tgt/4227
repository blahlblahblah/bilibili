编者按：作为波音777机型C类教员、东航五星机长，贾建军飞过多种机型，拥有过硬的飞行技术和丰富的飞行经验。
Editor's Note: As a Boeing 777 Class C instructor, China Eastern Five Star captain, Jia Jianjun over a variety of aircraft, with excellent flight technology and rich flight experience.
3月18日中午，贾建军机组驾驶抗疫包机MU7041从上海浦东国际机场起飞，将来自中国的医疗专家组和物资“护送”至意大利米兰。
March 18 noon, Jia Jianjun unit in an anti-epidemic charter flight MU7041 from Shanghai Pudong International Airport, the Chinese medical experts and supplies "escort" to Milan, Italy.
此次任务之前，贾建军的总飞行时间达21300小时，对带队完成飞行任务充满信心。
Before the mission, Jia Jianjun total flight time of 21,300 hours, to lead the team to complete the mission confidence.
而此行成功完成飞米兰的任务后，他直言有许多新收获。
After a successful trip to Milan, he said he had made many new discoveries.
主　笔 | 姜浩峰受访人 | 贾建军当我们机组飞进意大利飞航情报区的时候，心情确实与往常飞民航客机不同，也与2月上旬飞武汉驰援不同。
Jia Jianjun, our flight into Italy's flight information region, was in a different mood from our usual civilian aircraft and from flying to Wuhan in the first half of February.
这是我第一次飞米兰。
This is my first flight to Milan.
当我们的波音777抵达米兰的时候，我感受到的是来自意大利的感谢。
When our Boeing 777 arrived in Milan, I felt thanks from Italy.
Play视频：米兰塔台与中国机长的对话我是贾建军，东方航空公司上海飞行部飞行二部总经理。
Dialogue with the Captain I am Jia Jianjun, General Manager of Flight 2, Shanghai Flight Department of Orient Airlines.
我是在3月17日接到这次飞行任务的。
I received this mission on 17 March.
18日11时26分从浦东国际机场起飞，当地时间18日16时31分降落在米兰市马尔彭萨国际机场。
It departed from Pudong International Airport at 1126 hours on 18 May and landed at Malpensa International Airport in Milan at 1631 hours local time.
我们在米兰没下飞机，本来计划18时50分起飞回国，最后是在20时02分起飞的。
We did not disembark in Milan and had planned to take off at 1850 hours, and finally took off at 2020 hours.
从上海出发，31小时以后，我们回到上海。
Departing from Shanghai, we returned to Shanghai in 31 hours.
贾建军执飞的东航MU7041包机航班，运送中国专家赴意大利这次飞行，时间紧、任务重。
Jia Jianjun plane MU7041 charter flight, to transport Chinese experts to Italy on this flight, a tight time, heavy task.
当然，我是有心理准备的。
Of course, I was mentally prepared.
我们东航上海飞行部做过前期动员，说可能会有飞意大利的任务。
Our Shanghai flight department has made a preliminary mobilization, said that there may be a mission to Italy.
上海飞行部有空客A330、A350和波音777三种机型，飞行员按照机型组成各自部门。
The Shanghai flight department has three types, the Airbus A330, A350 and Boeing 777, and the pilots make up their divisions according to the type of aircraft.
我们波音777是2013年改装，2014年9月成立机型团队。
Our Boeing 777 was converted in 2013 and a fleet of aircraft models was established in September 2014.
在东航，波音777相对来说是一款新飞机，也是目前东航最大的机型。
On China Eastern, the Boeing 777 is a relatively new aircraft and by far the largest aircraft in China Eastern.
3月12日东航飞出首班赴意大利专家包机，目的地是罗马，机型是A350-900。
On 12 March, China Eastern flew its first charter flight to Italy for an expert chartered flight to Rome, the A350-900.
这次飞米兰，运送浙江赴意大利抗疫医疗专家组十余人，还有一些物资，我们波音777机组上了。
This flight to Milan, transported Zhejiang to Italy to fight against the disease more than a dozen medical experts, and some supplies, we Boeing 777 on board.
贾建军（右）和陈森机长在起飞前尽管此前，2月9日我就曾执飞上海到武汉的航班，运送华山医院的专家和物资，甚至我们6位机组成员中有4位是第二次执行特殊战“疫”包机任务，大家不仅拥有过硬的飞行技术，还有疫区航班的经验，可比起国内航线来，我们飞米兰必须克服更多困难。
Jia Jianjun (right) and Captain Chen Sen had flown from Shanghai to Wuhan on February 9th to transport experts and supplies from the Huashan Hospital. Even though four of our six crew members were on special battle charter flights for the second time, we had not only excellent flight skills, but also flight experience in affected areas, we had to overcome more difficulties than domestic flights.
东航原本没有上海飞米兰的民航客机航班，这是我第一次飞意大利。
It was the first time I had flown to Italy, and China Eastern did not originally have a Shanghai flight to Milan.
另一机长陈森在中货航飞过货运航班到米兰，那已经是十年前的事了。
Another captain, Chen Sen, flew cargo flights to Milan on cargo flights a decade ago.
如今陈森回归东航，对此行米兰一样充满了自豪感和自信心。
Now Chen Sen has returned to the East and is as proud and confident of his trip as he was of Milan.
我以前飞过法兰克福、伦敦、巴黎，这一段航路，起码在中国进入欧洲之前是差不多的，但临时加飞的航班需要牵涉到此行所有飞越国境地共8个国家的批复，只要有一个国家批复不了就得延宕。
I used to fly over Frankfurt, London and Paris, a route that was at least as close as it had been before China entered Europe, but the extra flights involved replies from eight countries in all of its territory, with only one country having to delay its approval.
而飞机进入意大利后，米兰马尔彭萨国际机场是什么情况，我也没有经验。
I have no experience in what happens to the Milan Marpenza International Airport after the plane enters Italy.
当我们机组6人领到3月18日起飞的飞行任务后，必须做好随时出发的准备。
When our crew of six people received a take-off mission on March 18, we must be ready to leave at any time.
18日中午出发，在从中国飞往意大利的一路平飞过程中，我们发现——当听说是运送抗击疫情的物资时，各国空管都纷纷提供最优航路，并表达了敬意和美好祝愿。
Departing at noon on the 18th, during a flight from China to Italy, we found that air traffic controllers from all over the world offered the best routes and paid homage and good wishes when they heard that supplies were being sent to fight the epidemic.
波音777停在机场停机坪，贾建军在做整备到了米兰上空，我的第一感觉就是米兰机场塔台的工作人员英语口音满重的，与在伦敦、法兰克福、巴黎听到的声音感觉不一样。
The Boeing 777 stopped at the airport tarmac, and Jia Jianjun was getting ready for Milan. My first feeling was that the staff at Milan's airport tower had a strong accent in English, unlike what I heard in London, Frankfurt and Paris.
当然，在飞这次航班之前，我们机组就做了准备。
Of course, we made preparations for the flight before we could fly it.
譬如我们的“90后”资深副驾驶利凌，他于2月19日执行了东航第二班波音777运送驰援武汉医疗队和防疫物资的包机任务，这次飞米兰是他第二次执行特殊战“疫”包机任务。
For example, Li Ling, our "90 plus" senior co-pilot, carried out a second charter flight on February 19 for the Wuhan medical team and epidemic prevention materials for the second time on a special battle "epidemic."
利凌主动申请执飞米兰这一班，还因为他是一名报务教员，在通信方面拥有丰富的经验。
Ling volunteered to fly to Milan, also because he was a newspaper teacher with extensive experience in communications.
毕竟塔台有些指挥是突然性的，我们必须仔细听，不能产生语言错觉。
After all, some tower conductors are sudden, we must listen carefully, can not produce language delusion.
我们与塔台沟通，也尽量放慢语速，不能太快，要让对方听得懂，甚至不能让交流不愉快。
We communicate with the tower and try to speak slowly, not too fast, to make the other person understand, or even to make the communication unhappy.
当我们和米兰塔台接上话后，确实和平时不一样。
When we spoke to the Milan tower, it was not the same as usual.
除了工作交流，我们多说了几句。
In addition to the exchange of work, we said a few more words.
“东方航空7041，非常感谢你们的支持，意大利人感谢你们！”我方回答：“加油，意大利！请照顾好我们的医生，中意友谊长存！”话虽平实，却让我感到很震撼！这确实有一种中意友谊升华的感觉。
"Eastern Airlines 7041, thank you very much, the Italian thank you!" We replied: "Come on, Italy! Please take care of our doctor, the friendship between China and Italy!"
机组和客舱经理刘佩玉一起与医疗专家交流这也是我第一次穿防护服执飞，真正体会到了医护人员的不易。
The crew and cabin manager Liu Pei-yu shared with the medical experts this is the first time that I wear protective clothing to fly, really understand the difficulties of medical personnel.
防护服在身，一举一动都不那么自在。
The suit was on, and he was not at liberty to move.
我们只需要坐着驾驶飞机，而医护人员穿着防护服后，还要进行各种医疗上的操作——操作机器，给病人打针输液，想想就非常不容易。
All we need to do is fly a plane, and it's not easy to think about all the medical procedures you need to perform when you're wearing protective clothing - operating a machine and giving a patient an injection.
在机长广播中，我是这么说的：“医疗队的专家们，你们不辞辛苦，不计回报，不怕生死，又一次冲在了第一线，而且越过国界，驰援意大利！你们此次前去意大利一线非常辛苦，我们更希望你们能照顾好自己，保护好自己，你们的安危都是祖国和人民的牵挂，待你们完成祖国交予的任务平安归来时，祖国接你们回家，东航接你们回家！”陈森对医疗专家组说：“我的爱人是一名航医，也在抗‘疫’的一线工作，我特别能理解你们的辛苦……”回到降落工作来说，平时到了欧洲大城市上空，我们经常要在空中左转右转，等待塔台命令，找时机降落。
"Experts from the medical team, who are working hard and paying nothing, are once again on the frontline and are crossing the border to help Italy..." Returning to Italy, we hope you can take care of yourselves and protect yourselves.
这次由于疫情的关系，米兰机场起降航班不多。
There are not many flights at Milan because of the outbreak.
塔台又给了我们优先落地权。
The tower gives us priority of landing rights.
我的感觉，比平时正常起降节约了15分钟。
I feel like I saved 15 minutes of normal take-off and landing.
第二批中国赴意大利抗疫专家抵达米兰我们机组成员没有下飞机。
The second batch of Chinese anti-epidemic experts arrived in Milan and our crew did not disembark.
这是东航对我们此行的一个保障要求——由于疫情的关系，尽量不与当地人接触。
This is a guarantee of China Eastern's visit to China - due to the outbreak of the disease, to minimize contact with the local people.
不过，我们公司罗马办事处的同事是赶到米兰迎接医学专家的。
However, our colleague from the Rome office arrived in Milan to meet the medical expert.
在飞机上，我感觉到意大利方面举行了一个欢迎仪式。
On the plane, I sensed a welcoming ceremony on the Italian side.
这无疑也是透露出他们对中国的感激之情的。
This is no doubt to reveal their gratitude to China.
从后来看到的照片上，我发现，意大利机场工作人员高举横幅，引用古罗马哲学家塞涅卡的名言：“我们是同一片大海的海浪，同一棵树上的树叶，同一座花园里的花朵”，以欢迎中国专家。
From the photos I later saw, the Italian airport staff held up banners quoting the Roman philosopher Seneca: "We are the same sea waves, the same tree leaves, the same garden flowers" to welcome the Chinese experts.
我们的飞机16时31分降落后，原本准备18时50分起飞的，而因为疫情的原因，检验检疫方面更需严格把关。
When our plane landed at 1631 hours, it was intended to take off at 1850 hours, and because of the outbreak, the inspection and quarantine aspects needed to be more strictly checked.
这样一来，我们延迟到20时02分才起飞。
As a result, we delayed taking off until 2020 hours.
在浦东航前准备厅留影，左三为贾建军虽然在意大利我们没有下飞机，可回到上海后，我们还是必须隔离14天。
Take pictures in the Pudong Pre-flight Preparation Hall, leaving Jia Jianjun Although we did not disembark in Italy, we had to remain in quarantine for 14 days after returning to Shanghai.
感谢我的家人对我的支持。
Thanks to my family for their support.
作为党员，也作为公司一个部门的负责人，我知道自己必须起到带头作用，冲在前线，到艰苦的地方去。
As a Party member and head of a department, I knew I had to take the lead, to the front, to the hard places.
事实上，去年6月我还曾临时接到任务，飞西班牙马德里，为公安部统一指挥的“长城行动”押解特大跨境电信诈骗案94个嫌疑人。
In fact, last June, I was given a temporary assignment to fly to Madrid, Spain, to escort 94 suspects in a huge cross-border telecommunications fraud case to Operation Great Wall, under the unified command of the Ministry of Public Security.
总体来说，这些飞行任务就是执飞机场不同，航班性质与民航客机不同，航班流程与民航客机也不同。
In general, these missions are different from airports, flights are different in nature from civilian passenger aircraft, and flight schedules are not the same as civilian passenger aircraft.
目前看，随着全球疫情局势的发展，我在隔离14天以后是否还有新任务，还不知道。
At the moment, as the global epidemic unfolds, I don't know if I have a new mission after 14 days of isolation.
外界有人担心，飞行员隔离14天，会否给正常航班起降带来影响，或者后续包机缺人飞。
There are concerns that the 14-day isolation of pilots will have an impact on normal flights, or follow-up charter flights are unavailable.
因为东航上海飞行部三种机型轮换，我认为，调度能够应对过来的。
Because of the three aircraft rotation of China Eastern's Shanghai flight department, I think the dispatching can handle it.
总之，我们希望自己的工作能对全世界抗击疫情有贡献，人们尽早战胜疫情。
In a word, we hope that our work can contribute to the worldwide fight against the epidemic, people will overcome the epidemic as soon as possible.
