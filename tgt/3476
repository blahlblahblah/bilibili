突然起来的疫情打乱中国车市回暖的步伐，消费不振同样会影响产能文|《财经》记者 李皙寅编辑|施智梁疫情冲击下的中国车市有多惨？3月12日下午，中国汽车工业协会给出了答案。
The sudden outbreak of the disease disrupted the pace of China's recovery, as did weak consumer spending. & # 160; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
中汽协数据显示，2020年2月，受新冠肺炎疫情影响，当月汽车产销环比和同比均呈大幅下降，且降幅明显高于上月。
In February 2020, affected by the outbreak of new crown pneumonia, auto production-sales ratio and year-on-year dropped significantly, and by a much larger margin than last month, according to the AAA.
当月汽车产销28.5万辆和31.0万辆，同比下降79.8%和79.1%。
That same month, 285,000 vehicles and 310,000 vehicles were sold, down 79.8 per cent and 79.1 per cent year on year.
综合今年前两个月数据，从车型来看，乘用车中运动型多用途乘用车（SUV）跌幅相对较小，多功能乘用车（MPV）跌幅最为明显；商用车中，重型货车跌幅相对较小，微型货车销量降幅最为显著。
Taking into account data for the first two months of the year, sport utility vehicles (SUVs) in passenger vehicles have fallen relatively little, MPVs have fallen most dramatically, heavy trucks have fallen relatively less in commercial vehicles, and sales of minivans have fallen most dramatically.
在疫情影响下，不同车型的消费坚挺程度迥然不同。
Under the impact of the epidemic, the strength of consumption varies greatly from model to model.
新能源汽车销量仍在跌跌不休。
Sales of new energy vehicles are still falling.
2月，新能源汽车产销分别完成1.0万辆和1.3万辆，环比下降77.3%和72.4%，同比下降82.9%和75.2%。
In February, the production and marketing of new energy vehicles were 10,000,00 and 13,000 respectively, down 77.3 percent and 72.4 percent respectively, down 82.9 percent and 75.2 percent year on year.
在新能源汽车主要品种中，纯电动汽车和插电式混合动力汽车产销环比和同比均呈大幅下降，插电式混合动力汽车产销更为显著。
Among the main new energy vehicles, the ratio of production to sales of pure electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles decreased significantly, and the production and sale of plug-in hybrid cars was more remarkable.
发布会上，中汽协人士表示产销大幅下滑，是受新冠肺炎疫情的严重影响。
At the press conference, the CAF people said that the production and sales of a sharp decline, is the new crown pneumonia epidemic seriously affected.
针对此，中国汽车工业协会提出稳增长、促复工、减负担、保物流、促消费等五项一揽子政策建议。
To this end, the China Automobile Industry Association put forward a stable growth, back-to-work, reduce the burden, guarantee logistics, promote consumption and other five policy packages.
从生产端来看，企业因复工进度慢、零部件供应等问题导致产出水平低；消费端，产品消费停滞，市场需求受到严重抑制，不止前两个月，对上半年的汽车市场都将产生重大影响。
From the production side, enterprises due to the slow pace of resumption of work, spare parts supply problems resulting in low levels of output; on the consumer side, product consumption stagnated, market demand was severely suppressed, and more than the previous two months will have a significant impact on the automotive market in the first half of the year.
中国汽车流通协会副秘书长郎学红告诉《财经》记者，虽然现阶段经销商可以消化原有库存，但综合考虑厂商恢复生产的节奏，部分车型将出现供给不足的情况。
Lang Xuehong, deputy secretary-general of the China Automobile Circulation Association, told Caijing that while dealers can digest existing inventories at this stage, some models will be in short supply given the pace at which manufacturers resume production.
“一个春节马路上空空荡荡，天气照样雾霾，能不能别再让汽车背锅。
"A Spring Festival street is empty, the weather is still haze, can not let the car back pot.
”天津一家美系车经销商店总直言，虽然厂家给了支持，但归根结底，开源最重要。
In Tianjin, a department store for car dealers is blunt, and while manufacturers have given support, in the final analysis, open source is the most important.
唇亡齿寒，主机厂在给予经销商包括调整绩效考核机制、增加免息期等方式，帮忙经销商克服难关。
Cold lips, the main machine factory in the dealer including adjustment of performance appraisal mechanism, increase interest-free period, and other means to help dealers overcome difficulties.
郎学红担心的是，现阶段虽然经销商已经开工八成，但整体消费需求不振，这会反作用于现有产能。
Lang Xuehong is worried that, although dealers have started 80% at this stage, but overall consumer demand is weak, which will counter-effect existing capacity.
根据流通协会的调查，大部分经销商依托现有资金能够支撑两至三个月，但资金压力仍然十分巨大。
According to the Circulation Association, most dealers are able to survive for two to three months with the money available, but the pressure is still enormous.
呼吁上游厂家给予经销商更多帮扶，比如加快兑现经销商2019年的商务考核奖励。
The upstream manufacturers are called upon to give more help to dealers, such as to accelerate the delivery of 2019 dealer business evaluation awards.
中汽协还介绍了汽车行业的复工情况，23家企业集团（年销量占比超过96%）复工复产情况，截至3月11日，复工率为90.1%，员工返岗率77%。
The Association also provided information on the resumption of work in the automobile industry, with 23 conglomerates (with an annual sales ratio of over 96 per cent) resuming work, with a return rate of 90.1 per cent and 77 per cent as of 11 March.
中汽协副总工程师许海东告诉《财经》记者，预计随着2月下旬企业逐步复工、复产，3月汽车产销将比2月会有明显增长。
Xu Haidong, deputy chief engineer of the FCA, told Caijing that auto production and sales are expected to increase markedly in March compared with February, as companies resume work and resume production in late February.
在安永合伙人叶亮看来，二、三季度可能会迎来一波需求反弹和释放，因为私家车的安全性和便利性受到重视，但今时不同往日，消费增加不意味着逆转爆发 ，疫情对2020年整体车市仍然是弊大于利。
According to EY GmbH partner Ye Liang, a demand rebound and release is likely in the second and third quarters, as private cars are valued for their safety and convenience, but unlike today, when increased consumption does not mean a reversal of the outbreak, the epidemic will continue to do more harm than good for the overall car market in 2020.
2019年四季度，中国车市已经从近两年的下跌中呈现出止跌回暖的迹象，但这一回暖势头被疫情打断。
In the fourth quarter of 2019, China's auto market has shown signs of slowing from its nearly two-year decline, but this time it has been interrupted by the epidemic.
具体来看，2019年2月是春节，2020年春节在1月，如果没有疫情，本应该是1月同比下跌，2月同比上升。
Specifically, February 2019 is the Spring Festival, 2020 Spring Festival in January, if not for the outbreak, should have been January year-on-year decline, February year-on-year rise.
为此，业内开始呼吁新一轮救市政策。
Therefore, the industry began to call for a new round of rescue policy.
汽车是国民经济支柱产业。
Automobiles are the backbone of national economy.
面对疫情影响，习近平总书记曾指出，“要积极稳定汽车等传统大宗消费，鼓励汽车限购地区适当增加汽车号牌配额，带动汽车及相关产品消费”。
In the face of the epidemic, General Secretary Xi Jinping has pointed out that "efforts should be made to stabilize traditional large-scale consumption, such as automobiles, and to encourage areas with auto purchase restrictions to appropriately increase the number plate quotas for automobiles and related products."
2月20日，商务部市场运行司副司长王斌在新闻发布会上表示，将深入贯彻落实中央关于“积极稳定汽车等传统大宗消费”的重要决策部署以及《国务院办公厅关于加快发展流通促进商业消费的意见》精神，会同相关部门研究出台进一步稳定汽车消费的政策措施，减轻疫情对汽车消费的影响。
On February 20, Wang Bin, deputy director of the marketing department of the Ministry of Commerce, said at a press conference that he would follow up on the central government's important decision-making arrangements on "actively stabilizing traditional large-scale consumption of automobiles" and the "Opinions of the General Office of the State Council on Accelerating Circulation for Commercial Consumption.
针对疫情对汽车行业的负面影响，中国汽车工业协会提出稳增长、促复工、减负担、保物流、促消费等一揽子政策建议。
In response to the negative impact of the epidemic on the auto industry, the China Automobile Industry Association has put forward a package of policy proposals for stable growth, job creation, burden reduction, logistics and consumption promotion.
具体包括：调整对企业“双积分”的考核，延缓国六、达标车型、ETC等政策要求。
Specific include: adjusting the "double integral" assessment of enterprises, delay the national 6, up to standard models, ETC and other policy requirements.
继续大力发展新能源汽车产业，包括优化并延续新能源汽车补贴政策，继续加大新能源基础设施建设。
We will continue to vigorously develop the new energy automobile industry, including optimizing and continuing the new energy vehicle subsidy policy, and continue to expand the new energy infrastructure construction.
此外，尽快出台政策激发消费潜力，包括限购地区适当增加汽车号牌配额，解禁新能源汽车限购，调整小排量（1.6L级以下）乘用车购置税率，出台汽车下乡促进消费政策等。
In addition, policies should be put in place as soon as possible to stimulate consumption potential, including an appropriate increase in the quota for vehicle licence plates in restricted areas, the lifting of restrictions on the purchase of new energy vehicles, the adjustment of the acquisition tax rate for passenger vehicles (below 1.6 L) and the introduction of policies to promote consumption by motor vehicles in rural areas.
在上述多重政策的影响下，今日A股尾盘，汽车股拉升，一汽夏利拉升封板，江淮汽车、东风汽车、一汽轿车等快速跟涨。
Under the influence of the above multiple policies, A shares in the late part of today, auto shares pulled up, FAW Shari pull up the seal, Jianghuai Automobile, Dongfeng Motor, FAW car and other rapid rise.
板块内多只股票飘红。
Plate shares fluttering red.
不过围绕具体政策业内也有不同意见，如何通盘考虑各种影响因素将成为对决策者的考验。
There are, however, differences of opinion around specific policy industries, and how the various influencing factors are considered together will be a test for policy makers.
“销量下滑背后，终究是经济因素影响，若因此推迟国六排放标准则弊大于利。
"After all, it's economic factors that are behind the sales decline, which would do more harm than good if we put off six emissions standards."
”能源基金会中国交通项目主管辛焰对《财经》记者表示，国六车型已经是消费市场主流，推迟国六排放标准，不利于维护市场公平竞争，也会打击地方控制机动车污染的积极性。
Xin Yans, director of China transport at the Energy Foundation, told Caijing that the Guoqi-6 model was already in the mainstream of the consumer market, delaying the introduction of six national emission standards that would not help level the playing field in the market and discourage local efforts to control motor vehicle pollution.
