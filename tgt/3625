美国的情况将会变得多糟糕？华盛顿州州长杰伊 · 伊斯利（Jay Inslee）在 3 月 10 日曾表示，仅仅在华盛顿州，两个月内感染人数就可能达到 6.4 万人。
How bad will things get in the US? Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington state, said on March 10 that in Washington state alone, the number of people infected could reach 64,000 within two months.
而该数据是目前全美公布确诊人数的 16 倍，根据美国约翰斯 · 霍普金斯大学发布的实时统计数据显示，截至北京时间 3 月 17 日早 6 时，美国新冠肺炎确诊病例已达 4,464 例。
That's 16 times the number of confirmed cases reported nationwide, with 4,464 confirmed cases of New Crown Pneumonia by 6 a.m. March 17, according to real-time statistics released by Johns Hopkins University in the United States.
在杰伊 · 伊斯利发表上述言论时，这种预测听起来十分吓人而且不切实际，因为当时华盛顿州仅确诊了 162 例新冠肺炎。
At the time of Jay Eastley's comments, the prediction sounded frightening and unrealistic, given that only 162 cases of pneumonia had been diagnosed in Washington state.
但到了 3 月 14 日，该州的确认人数已有 642 人，这表明确诊病例是如何迅速地翻倍的。
By 14 March, however, there were 642 confirmed cases in the state, indicating how quickly the number of confirmed cases had doubled.
美国总统特朗普于 3 月 13 日在白宫宣布美国进入“国家紧急状态”，以应对新冠肺炎疫情，并介绍了最新的检测流程。
US President Trump declared a "state of emergency" at the White House on March 13, in response to the outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia, and introduced the latest testing procedures.
如果要推测美国可能发生的情况，最坏的可能则要参考在意大利已经发生的一切。
If one were to speculate about what might happen in the US, the worst-case scenario would be to look at what has happened in Italy.
目前，意大利已经有 27,980 例确诊病患，死亡 2,158 例，并且还在持续地增加。
At present, there are 27,980 confirmed cases and 2,158 deaths in Italy, and the number continues to increase.
图 | 意大利的确诊病例曲线（来源：worldometers）在意大利抗疫一线的医生 Daniele Macchini 于 3 月 8 日发表了一篇博客文章，他表示，在疫情初期医院在做准备，慢慢地选择性清空了此前的病人，营造出一种 “我们仍然不理解的、超现实的寂静和空虚的气氛” 时，那种早期的平静感。
Diagnosed case curves in Italy (source: worldmeters) Daniele Macchini, a physician on the frontline of the Italian epidemic, published a blog on March 8 that the early days of the epidemic were being prepared by hospitals to slowly and selectively empty previous patients, creating an "atmosphere of surreal silence and emptiness that we still don't understand."
这种感觉就像在为一场战争做准备，而医护工作者们并不确定这场战争会不会到来。
The feeling is like preparing for a war that health-care workers are not sure will come.
但是随后，患者开始陆续进入医院，并且总是得到相同的诊断：双侧间质性肺炎，这种疾病会侵袭肺部，使呼吸困难。
Later, however, the patient began to enter the hospital, always receiving the same diagnosis: bilateral interstitial pneumonia, a disease that attacks the lungs and makes breathing difficult.
“人们之前都听从建议，轻微症状时在家中发烧一周或十天而没有外出，这降低了传染他人的危险。
"People have been advised to stay in their homes for a week or ten days with mild symptoms, which reduces the risk of contagion," he said.
但直到他们再也不能忍受了，开始喘不上气，需要氧气。
But until they could stand it no longer, they began to gasp and need oxygen.
”因此，重症监护室很快就塞满了。
So the intensive care unit was soon full.
Macchini 写道：“战争确实爆发了，并且日夜不间断。
"The war did break out, day and night," Macchini wrote.
不再有外科医生、泌尿科医师、骨科医生，我们只是医生。
No more surgeons, urologists, orthopaedic surgeons. We're just doctors.
”他突然成为了一个团队的一部分，来面对这场不堪重负的灾难。
"He suddenly became part of a team to deal with the overwhelming disaster.
由于对新冠病毒的药物疗法有限，治疗主要取决于个体的抵抗力，希望身体可以自行消除病毒。
Because drug therapy for the new crown virus is limited, treatment depends largely on an individual's resistance, and it is hoped that the body will be able to eliminate the virus itself.
随着病例成倍增加，医院的病床正以惊人的速度填补，拭子的结果一个接一个地出现：阳性、阳性、阳性。
As the number of cases has multiplied, hospital beds are being filled at an alarming rate, and swab after swab has produced one after another: positive, positive and positive.
“急诊室突然崩溃了。
"The emergency room collapsed.
”Macchini 表示，“尽管社交网络上仍有一些人以不害怕、忽略自己的恐惧而感到自豪，并抗议限制了他们的正常生活方式。
"Although there are still people on social networking sites who pride themselves on not being afraid and ignoring their fears, they protest restrictions on their normal way of life," says Macchini.
但事实是，流行病正在可怕地发生。
But the truth is that the epidemic is taking a terrible turn.
”根据世卫组织的数据，新冠肺炎的总体病死率大约为 3.5％，尽管真实数字尚不确定，因为某些病例可能没有症状。
According to the WHO, the overall fatality rate for pneumonia is about 3.5 per cent, although the true figure is uncertain, as some cases may be asymptomatic.
但在意大利，这一比例可能会高于 6％。
In Italy, however, the proportion is likely to be higher than 6 per cent.
其中有部分原因是意大利的人口年龄较大——80 岁以上人群的病死率或是 20 岁以下人群病死率的 1000 倍。
This is partly because Italy's population is older - more than 1,000 times more likely to die from diseases in the over-80's or under-20s.
根据此前数据，80 岁以上的人或有 18％ 的死亡概率。
According to previous data, people over 80 years of age may have an 18 per cent chance of dying.
Macchini 在文章中呼吁人们保持距离，停止聚集以减缓疾病的传播：“请分享！分享！分享该信息。
Macchini called on people to stay away from each other and stop gathering to slow the spread of the disease: "Share! Share! Share this information."
我们必须宣布出去，以防止在意大利发生的事情再次上演。
We must announce it in order to prevent what is happening in Italy from happening again.
”这是意大利过去几周的故事，接下来的几周美国又会有怎样的故事发生？到目前为止，医生已经知道了该疾病的一些传播模式，而病毒感染的传播速度则取决于其内在特性，也取决于社会给予病毒的传播机会。
This is the story of the past few weeks in Italy, and what will happen in the United States in the coming weeks? So far, doctors have learned about some of the spread patterns of the disease, and the speed with which infection spreads depends on its intrinsic properties and on the opportunities society gives the virus to spread.
每种病毒都有一个所谓的基本感染数（R0），它是一个感染者会感染多少其他人的度量。
Each virus has a so-called basic infection number (R0), which is a measure of how much other people are infected.
图 | 基本感染数（R0）如何影响疾病的传播能力（来源：MIT Technology Review）目前，对新型冠状病毒的 R0 估值介于 2.0 和 2.5 之间。
Figure # 124; How Basic Infection Number (R0) Affects Disease Transmission (Source: MIT Technology Review) At present, R0 estimates for the new coronavirus range between 2.0 and 2.5.
但根据世界卫生组织的说法，这只是最佳推断。
But according to the World Health Organization, this is the best extrapolation.
相比之下，普通流感的平均 R0 为 1.3；而麻疹等传染性极强的疾病，其 R0 大于 10。
By contrast, the average R0 for ordinary influenza was 1.3; for highly infectious diseases such as measles, the R0 was greater than 10.
从上述表格可以看出，理论上讲，该病毒可以从最初的 5 个受感染人向外迅速传播，尽管实际上在一定数量的增长后，传播速度会逐步放缓。
As can be seen from the table above, in theory the virus can spread rapidly from the original five infected persons, although in fact the rate of transmission slows down after a certain amount of growth.
注意，R0 的数值并不是一成不变的。
Note that the values for R0 are not static.
隔离患者，以及其接触者可以有效改变传播率。
Isolation of patients and their contacts can effectively change transmission rates.
对于在 2003 年爆发的 SARS 疫情，最终正是通过类似的公共卫生措施彻底消灭了病毒。
For the SARS epidemic that erupted in 2003, it was through similar public-health efforts that the virus was finally eliminated.
因此采取 “社会疏离” 手段是减慢病毒传播最为有效的方法。
So "social alienation" is the most effective way to slow down the spread of the virus.
在新冠病毒传播不受控制且检测能力不断提高的地区，确诊病例的数量在成倍增加。
The number of confirmed cases is multiplying in areas where the spread of the new crown virus is uncontrolled and detection capacity is increasing.
与华盛顿过去的一周一样，每隔两天就会增加一倍。
As in the past week in Washington, it doubles every two days.
但是，一旦采取了相应减少传播的措施，确诊病例翻倍的时间就会大大减慢。
However, once measures have been taken to reduce transmission accordingly, the doubling of the number of confirmed cases can be considerably slowed down.
例如，在日本的确诊病例在 10 天才翻了一倍。
In Japan, for example, confirmed cases doubled in 10 days.
为了避免不堪重负的医院发生危机，政府和卫生机构必须采取手段减缓疫情传播速度。
To avoid a crippling hospital crisis, governments and health agencies must take steps to slow the spread of the disease.
而这个思维模式就和英国、德国等国家所谓的 “拉平曲线” 的想法类似。
This pattern of thinking is similar to the so-called "leveling curve" in countries such as Britain and Germany.
其认为，尽管可能最终大多数人仍会感染病毒，但随着将传播时间的拉长，将有机会挽救更多生命。
It argues that while most people may end up infected with the virus, there is a chance of saving more lives as the spread of the virus continues.
因为这将使人们得到更好的护理。
Because it will give people better care.
一旦医院的重症监护室挤满了患者，并且没有足够的设备（如呼吸机等）来治疗，就会出现意大利那样的艰难处境，可能导致更高的死亡率。
Once the intensive care unit in the hospital is full of patients and there is not enough equipment (such as a ventilator) to treat it, Italy's plight could lead to higher death rates.
检测能力跟得上吗？世界卫生组织负责人向全世界传达了一个简单的信息，即应该对谁进行新冠病毒检测：“检测、检测、检测，对每个可疑的病例进行检测。
The WHO chief has sent a simple message to the world who should be tested for the new crown virus: "Detect, detect, test, and test every suspected case.
”但根据 CNN 报道，虽然美国卫生官员表示测试正在加速进行，并且在多个州都进行了直通测试，但目前仍然缺乏可用测试。
But, according to CNN, while U.S. health officials say testing is accelerating and is being conducted in several states, there is still a lack of available testing.
目前，美国一线的医护人员正在统计拥有的每台呼吸机、每个 ICU 病床，并正在针对最坏的情况进行应急计划。
First-line health care workers in the United States are now counting every respirator and every ICU bed they own, and contingency planning is under way for the worst.
同时，白宫冠状病毒特别工作组负责人、副总统迈克 · 彭斯（Mike Pence）和高级卫生官员正尝试让一个 “神经紧张” 的国家平静下来。
Meanwhile, the head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, Vice President Mike Pence, and senior health officials are trying to calm a "nervous" country.
他们表示，对新冠病毒的测试进入了一个“新阶段”，因为本周将有 2,000 多个实验室上线。
They say testing for the new crown virus has entered a "new phase" as more than 2,000 laboratories go online this week.
而这是与商业实验室合作扩大测试范围的结果。
And that's the result of working with commercial laboratories to expand the scope of the tests.
彭斯曾表态，将优先考虑医护人员和急救人员，“他们在那里，并伴随着受到新冠病毒影响的人。
Burns has said he will give priority to paramedics and paramedics, "where they are, with people affected by the new crown virus."
”此外，他还表示具有咳嗽、发烧或其他症状的 65 岁以上的美国人也是高度优先关注对象。
"Americans over the age of 65 who have coughs, fever or other symptoms are also high-priority concerns, he said.
但在对抗新冠病毒的前线，一些医院的工作人员说，他们暂时没有感到“被优先考虑”。
But on the front lines of the fight against the new crown virus, some hospital staff said they felt "no priority" for the time being.
在新罕布什尔州的一名注册护士说，她所在医院的医护人员没有 N95 口罩，这迫使他们不断重复使用旧的口罩。
A registered nurse in New Hampshire said her hospital staff did not have N95 masks, forcing them to repeatedly use old masks.
并且也有患者在最近测试呈阳性后，从急诊室走到医院病房接受治疗时，整个过程也没有按照适当的安全规程进行。
And patients who recently tested positive walked from the emergency room to the hospital ward without following proper safety procedures.
这名已工作了 28 年的资深护士（因担心报复而要求不愿透露姓名）说：“所有医生和护士都与病人接触。
"All doctors and nurses are in contact with patients," said the 28-year-old senior nurse, who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation.
如果有人测试呈阳性，那么我们有很多人将不得不在家中隔离两个星期，而现在的人手已经开始不足了。
If someone tests positive, many of us will have to stay home for two weeks, and we're already understaffed.
”图 | 美国疾控中心报道首例工作人员确诊（来源：CDC 官网）美国疾控中心在 3 月 15 日宣布，有员工感染了新冠病毒，这是该机构的第一名感染者。
CDC reports first case of infection The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced on March 15 that employees were infected with the new crown virus, the agency's first case of infection.
不过 CDC 表示，这名新冠病毒检测呈阳性的员工目前 “情况良好，并且已被隔离，以防止传染其他人。
But the CDC said the employee, who tested positive for the virus, was "in good condition and has been quarantined to prevent transmission to others."
” 声明补充说道，同一单位的其他员工正在远程办公，同时办公室也在进行深度清理。
The statement added that other employees in the same unit were telecommuting and the office was undergoing a deep clean-up.
CDC 表示，出于隐私方面的考虑，他们不会透露有关此病例或后续其他病例的更多细节。
The CDC said it would not disclose further details of the case or other subsequent cases because of privacy concerns.
除此之外，美国国防部新闻发言人、公共事务部部长助理 Jonathan Rath Hoffman 称，截至 3 月 16 日 5 点，美国国防部已报告 37 例新冠肺炎确诊病例。
In addition, U.S. Defense Department spokesman Jonathan Rath Hoffman, assistant secretary of public affairs, said the Pentagon had reported 37 confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia as of 5: 00 on March 16.
其中包括 18 名军人、13 名家属、3 名平民，以及 3 名承包商人员。
These included 18 military personnel, 13 dependants, 3 civilians and 3 contractor personnel.
发言人表示，截至前一日早晨，美国国防部已有 495 人接受了新冠病毒检测。
By the morning of the previous day, 495 people had been tested for the virus, the spokesman said.
美国国防部长马克 · 埃斯珀（Mark Esper）将与他的副手及其他工作人员保持隔离，以防止新冠肺炎病毒扩散。
US Defense Secretary Mark Esper will keep his deputy and other staff at bay to prevent the spread of the New Crown Pneumonia virus.
最坏的建模预计：2.14 亿美国人感染，170 万人死亡如果不采取积极行动来减缓新冠病毒在人与人之间传播速度，在美国最坏的结果将会发生什么？根据《纽约时报》报道，美国 CDC 的疾病建模人员预计，可能会有多达 65％ 的美国人最终感染新冠病毒。
The worst-case scenario: 214 million Americans infected and 1.7 million dead What would happen in the United States if no positive action was taken to slow the spread of the new crown virus from person to person? As many as 65% of Americans could end up with the new crown virus, according to disease modellers at the U.S. CDC, the New York Times reported.
根据该报道，美国疾控中心与 50 个专家团队共享了其建模模型，所有的团队都在努力地估算病毒传播的速度，以及其引起的病例的严重程度。
According to the report, the CDC shared its modelling model with a team of 50 experts, all of whom worked hard to estimate the rate of virus transmission and the severity of the cases it caused.
最坏情况的数字反映出，如果不采取措施减慢病毒的传播速度，这种病毒会在人与人之间快速传播。
The worst-case numbers reflect the fact that the virus can spread quickly from person to person if nothing is done to slow its spread.
如果不控制这种传播方式，那么每个感染病毒的人都可能感染另外两到三个人，从而导致传染性不断增长。
If this mode of transmission is not controlled, each person infected with the virus may become infected with two or three other people, leading to increasing infectivity.
当然，要注意的是，对大流行病的真实过程进行建模取决于更广泛且准确的科学信息，并且必须要考虑应对措施的效果及诸如医疗设备储备等问题。
Of course, it is important to note that modelling the true course of a pandemic depends on broader and accurate scientific information, and that the effectiveness of response measures and issues such as medical equipment stocks must be considered.
根据《泰晤士报》报道，美国 CDC 预计，美国最终可能有 240 万至 2100 万人最终进入医院，而其中的重症患者或将 “挤满” 美国的急诊病房和重症监护病房。
According to The Times, the U.S. CDC expects between 2.4 million and 21 million people to end up in hospitals, with severe cases likely to be "packed" with emergency and intensive care units in the United States.
在某些模型预测中，美国最终的死亡人数可能为 20 万至 170 万之见。
In some model predictions, the final death toll in the United States could range from 200,000 to 1.7 million.
相比之下，美国每年约有 3 万人死于流感。
By contrast, about 30,000 people die each year from flu in the United States.
图 | 商店的货架空空如也，购物者囤积了大量商品（来源：MIT Technology Review）3 月 15 日，美国总统特朗普呼吁美国人停止囤积食品杂货和其他物资，“你不必买那么多。
Racks at the store are empty and shoppers are stocking up on goods. (Source: MIT Technology Review) On March 15, U.S. President Trump called on Americans to stop hoarding groceries and other goods.
别着急，放松点就行了。
Don't worry, just relax.
”特朗普在与主要杂货连锁店的管理者交谈后向美国人保证，杂货店将继续营业，供应链将保持健康。
Trump assured Americans, after talking to the managers of major grocery chains, that the grocery store would continue to operate and that the supply chain would remain healthy.
但在特朗普发表上述言论之前，美国国立卫生研究院国家过敏和传染病研究所的负责人、政府首席传染病专家安东尼 · 福奇（Anthony Fauci）博士表示，他希望看到更激进的管控措施，如全国停摆 14 天，这将要求美国人尽量宅在家里，以帮助减缓新冠状病毒的传播。
But prior to Trump's remarks, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health and a leading government infectious-diseases expert, said he would like to see more aggressive controls, such as a 14-day nationwide moratorium, that would require Americans to stay at home as much as possible to help slow the spread of the new coronavirus.
美国 CDC 的专家之一朗尼尼（Ira Longini）则对媒体表示：“面对疫情，你赢不了。
"In the face of the epidemic, you can't win," Ira Longini, one of the experts at CDC, told the media.
如果你做得过头，就会让人惊慌。
If you overdo it, it can be scary.
而如果你做得不好，人们就会轻视。
And if you don't do well, people will look down on you.
所以，你必须要小心。
So, you have to be careful.
”而美股历史性地在 6 个交易日内发生了熔断“三连击”，或许让特朗普切实感到了些许惊慌。
Trump may have been a bit alarmed by the historic meltdown in the US stock market in six trading days.
3 月 16 日下午他在白宫举行发布会，宣布应对新冠肺炎疫情的指导意见，建议民众避免参加 10 人以上的聚会，远离酒吧、饭馆等公共场合。
In the afternoon of March 16, he held a press conference at the White House to announce guidelines for dealing with the outbreak of pneumonia, advising people to avoid going to parties of more than 10 people and staying away from public places such as bars and restaurants.
另外，尽量减少出行。
Also, minimize travel.
指导意见同时还要求已经出现社区感染的各州关闭酒吧、饭馆和其他公共设施，但这并不是强制措施。
The guidance also requires states with existing community infections to close bars, restaurants and other public facilities, but this is not mandatory.
特朗普也首次对外表示：“美国经济有可能将出现衰退，不过，目前首先控制疫情蔓延是美国各级政府的工作重心。
Trump also said for the first time: "The US economy is likely to experience a recession, but controlling the spread of the epidemic first is a priority for all levels of government in the US.
”在美股暴跌近 13%，创下近三十多年来的跌幅纪录之后，似乎刺激了特朗普的 “种族主义神经”。
Trump's "racist nerves" seem to have been stimulated after US stocks tumbled nearly 13 per cent, setting a record decline in more than three decades.
他在 Twitter 上将新冠病毒称为“Chinese Virus”，这引发了众多民众的激烈反应，在其状态之后的留言也极为“割裂” 与“极端”。
His Twitter call of the new crown virus, called "Chinese Virus," provoked violent reactions from many people, and the message following its status was extremely "compartmentalized" and "extreme."
图 | 特朗普的 “种族主义” 言论截图（来源：Twitter）任何一种病毒都不应是哪一个国家的问题，而是全世界、全人类的问题。
Trump's "racist" speech screenshot (source: Twitter) No virus should be a problem for any one country, but for the entire world, and for all humanity.
尤其，在世卫组织宣布新冠病毒是 “全球大流行” 病之后，新冠肺炎疫情已是一个全球共同面对的问题。
In particular, the outbreak of new crown pneumonia has become a global problem following the WHO's declaration of the new crown virus as a "global pandemic."
各国政府应该对自己应付的责任有所担当，“甩锅”控制不了疫情的蔓延，也阻止不了经济的下滑。
Governments should be held accountable for their actions, and "frying pans" will not control the spread of the epidemic or halt the economic downturn.
只有保持理性的态度，积极科学地安排应对疫情的防控措施，才是当下面对新冠病毒最有力的回应。
Only to maintain a rational attitude, actively and scientifically arrange to deal with the epidemic prevention and control measures, is now facing the most powerful response to the new crown virus.
