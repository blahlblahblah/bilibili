一场新冠肺炎疫情打乱了所有人的生活节奏，医生不眠不休走上抗疫最前线，企业加班加点生产防护物资，民间组织合力协调各方力量，也有热心人力所能及为抗疫出一分力文｜《财经》记者 马霖编辑｜余乐整个春节期间，武汉的街道不再熙熙攘攘，变得清冷安静。
| | | | | | | | | | | | A new outbreak of pneumonia has disrupted life for everyone, with doctors on the frontline of the epidemic, companies working overtime to produce protective materials, and civil society organizations working together to coordinate efforts and help others within their capabilities to fight the epidemic.
辛野是为数不多穿梭于武汉三镇的人，他不是专业外卖员、快递员，但他通过线上骑手平台，自发地为武汉人跑腿采买生活用品。
Xinno is one of the few people who shuttles through Wuhan. He is not a professional takeaway or express delivery man, but he runs errands for Wuhan people on his own initiative.
新冠肺炎这场突发公共卫生事件打乱了所有人的生活节奏，也包括辛野。
New Crown Pneumonia, a public health emergency, disrupted the pace of life for everyone, including Sinoe.
90后的辛野是内蒙人，在武汉读大学后就扎根在这座城市，职业是健身教练，喜欢看书、看画展，疫情爆发前他每天去西西弗书店读书，已经进入休假模式。
Sinoe, a native of Inner Mongolia after 90, took root in Wuhan after his college education. He was a fitness instructor and enjoyed reading and art exhibitions. Before the outbreak of the epidemic, he had gone to Sisyphus Bookstore every day and was on vacation.
为了阻隔病毒传播，1月23日武汉“封城”，公共交通停摆，人们居家隔离。
To stop the spread of the virus, on January 23, Wuhan "closed the city," public transport stopped, people in isolation.
辛野在不少微信群里看到留言：“出不了门没办法买菜”、“家里有小孩需要看管，奶粉都快吃不上了”，接线上订单的外卖小哥人手也不足。
Xinno in a lot of micro-letter groups see messages: "can not go out of the door no way to buy vegetables", "there are children to watch, milk powder is almost no longer available," the wiring order of the little takeaway brother is also understaffed.
“我看了心里很难过，我身体好免疫力强，想为武汉人民出一份力，给不能出门的人送上日常用品，总不能饿着。
"I read the heart very sad, I have good immunity, want to Wuhan people to play a role, to the people can not go out to send daily necessities, can not always hungry.
”辛野告诉《财经》记者。
Sinoe told Caijing.
他很快下载了骑手软件，电动车充上电，开始了为武汉市民跑腿代购、送菜送药的日子。
He quickly downloaded rider software, electric cars charged with electricity, began running errands for Wuhan city, delivery of medicine day.
非常时期，武汉整座城市和武汉人的状态都发生了很大变化。
During the unusual period, the whole city of Wuhan and the state of Wuhan people have undergone great changes.
辛野说，自己可能是武汉现在为数不多、每天过得挺开心的人，“路上的行人里，外卖小哥和我情绪最好。
Mr. Sinno said he was probably one of the few Wuhan people who are happy every day. 'Among pedestrians, take-out boys and I are in the best mood.
”虽然城市的气氛萧瑟，但是想到今天又帮几个家庭送菜了，心情就会变好。
Although the atmosphere in the city is bleak, the thought of helping several families serve food today makes the mood better.
“本想去火神山医院帮忙”辛野身体素质好，跑腿送菜之前，他本想去火神山医院建设工地帮忙，联系到医院建设工程部后，被告知参加建设需要会专业工种，比如电焊、水暖，只是有力气、能搬运还不够。
"I wanted to go to Mount Fukuyama Hospital to help" Xinno good physical quality, running errands before the delivery of food, he would like to go to the construction site to help, contact the hospital construction project, was told to participate in the construction need professional jobs, such as welding, plumbing, just physical strength, can not be enough.
“跑腿代购是我力所能及的事。
"It's within my power to run errands.
”他说。
'he said.
疫情之下，很多配送员还没上班，骑手平台上订单爆满，多数无人接单。
Under the epidemic, many distribution workers have not yet come to work, rider platforms full of orders, most unattended.
辛野会筛选出一看就很急需的订单去采买，比如写着“阿莫西林、各种水果、无接触配送”的订单，一些配送员害怕接触感冒病人，这类单子经常很久没人接。
Sinoe sifts through orders that look badly needed, such as "Amoxicillin, fruits of all kinds, no contact delivery," and some are afraid of catching cold patients, a list that has often gone unanswered for a long time.
“有一次很晚了，药店快关门，我接了这单，跑了几家药店买全了药。
"One late hour, the drugstore was closing. I accepted the order and went to several pharmacies to buy all the medicine.
”疫情下的武汉，药店开门少，药也不全，买三种药就要跑四五家店，这一单是当天的倒数第二单，辛野当作第一单配送，因为担心药店随时关门。
Wuhan, the epicentre of the epidemic, had few pharmacies open and medicines were incomplete. Four or five shops were required to buy the three drugs, the second-to-last order of the day.
“还有一单，内容是婴幼儿奶粉、尿不湿、辅食这些，跑腿费不高，没人接，我接了，不能让小孩子没吃的。
"There is another, the contents of baby milk powder, urine not wet, auxiliary feeding these, running errands are not high, no one answered, I took, can not let children eat.
”一般骑手会尽量在短时间内接更多单，或者多接顺路单、高价单，辛野说他做这件事的初衷不同，为了凑齐大家需要的东西，他会跑很多店，或者在超市里采买几个小时，基本上一单要买30多样东西。
The average rider tries to take more orders in as short a time as possible, or to take more than one or two orders, and Sino says he does it for a different purpose, running stores or buying hours at a supermarket, essentially 30 different things at a time.
每单的酬劳不高，20多块钱，晚上吃饭的时候辛野会想：”今天平台和微信加起来跑了七八单，又少了七八个家庭出来买东西，少了七八家感染的可能。
The price per bill is not high, more than 20 yuan, at night when Sinnon will think: "Today's platform and micro-credit together ran 78, and seven or eight families out to buy things, seven or eight less likely to be infected.
”“封城”以来，武汉变得空旷，经常阴天，时而下雨。
Since the closure of the city, Wuhan has become empty, often cloudy, sometimes rainy.
对小区和路不熟，加上疫情下很多路和门都封闭了，他经常走冤枉路，迟到了好几次，但大家不会因此有怨言，还叮嘱他路上小心，照顾好自己。
The lack of familiarity with the neighborhood and the road, coupled with the closure of roads and doors due to the outbreak, meant that he was often unjustly delayed several times, but no one complained about this, and advised him to take care of himself on the way.
最晚一次，他从华师园北路推车十几公里，到家已是12点多。
At the latest, he arrived at home more than 12 o'clock from the North Huashuyuan trolley about ten kilometers.
走在路上的辛野，看到几天前还关着门的酒店，正陆续被征用接纳隔离患者，酒店工作人员“全副武装”。
Walking on the road Sinoe, saw a few days ago still closed the door of the hotel, is being requisitioned to accept isolated patients, hotel staff "fully armed."
每天经过协和医院和对面的武展方舱医院，一公里内，他都能闻到淡淡的消毒水的味道。
Every day after the Concorde Hospital and the Wushu Square Hospital opposite, within a kilometer, he can smell the faint smell of disinfectant.
这是隔离在家的人无法感受到的武汉。
This is Wuhan, which can not be felt by the isolated people at home.
晚上采买配送结束回家的路上，辛野路过已经被征用为轻症患者隔离点的酒店路过协和医院发热门诊时，辛野拍下了这张照片，协和是武汉收治新冠肺炎患者的定点医院之一没有了往日的拥堵，这是武汉最近汽车寥寥的路况辛野家住在光谷广场站附近，这里是武昌区中心商圈之一，正常情况下一直是人满为患“跑80公里，只为送一单”2月7日那天，辛野接触了一个处于隔离期的人，当时他的电瓶车已经没电，赶紧开了辆共享单车，送这一单用了1个小时。
At the end of the evening on his way home, Sinino passes a hotel that has been requisitioned as a quarantined light-ill patient clinic at a congested hospital in Concord, one of Wuhan's few designated hospitals for treating patients with Newcastle Pneumonia.
2月8日他只跑了一单，下午1点出发，从武汉最东边的光谷骑到武汉最西边的后湖，自行车骑了80公里，回家是晚上8点，后腿已经抽筋了。
Feb. 8, he only ran a single one, 1 p.m., from Wuhan's easternmost valley to the westernmost Houhu, the bike rode 80 kilometers, home at 8 pm, his hind legs already cramped.
2月9日晚他这样记录这一天：“最近太累，早上起晚，没吃早饭就去超市排队了。
On the evening of February 9, he wrote down the day: "Lately so tired that I get up late in the morning and go to the supermarket in line without breakfast.
送了6家菜＋路上带一个拿很多菜不认识的人回家，车没电，我也头痛，饿的不行，回家吃饭了。
Send 6 dishes + the road with a lot of vegetables do not know who came home, the car ran out of electricity, I also have a headache, hungry can not, go home to eat.
”非常时期，武汉还在营业的餐厅很少，他数了下，武昌区自己所居住的片区附近大概有十来家开门，汉口那边开得更少。
Wuhan, which has few restaurants open during the hard times, counted about a dozen homes near his district in Wuchang, and fewer on the Hankou side.
大超市也并非都开门营业，几家沃尔玛、家乐福、悦活里开了，一个片区内如果有5家武商超市，大概会开一两家，大多数便利店也关门，极少数开着，但没什么东西。
Not all big supermarkets are open. Several Wal-Mart stores, Carrefour stores and happy shops are open. If there are five Wal-Mart stores in a district, they will probably open one or two. Most of the convenience stores are closed.
武汉的超市最近一直是三点关门。
Wuhan supermarkets have been closing at three o'clock recently.
直到几天之前，超市里还很缺包菜、白菜这些日常菜品，菜也不新鲜，菜价涨幅从30％到3倍不等。
Until a few days ago, the supermarket was still short of cabbage, cabbage these daily dishes, dishes are not fresh, vegetable prices rose from 30% to 3 times.
辛野说，拉青菜的车从冷库一出来，车上的菜还来不及摆在菜架上，就被一抢而空。
Xinno said the cart with vegetables pulled from the freezer came out before the food was ready to be placed on the dish rack and was snatched up.
一般中午11－12点菜就没了，黄瓜剩下半截半截的，大蒜和生姜剩一些，白菜、小白菜、奶白菜、茼蒿、包菜、生菜、菜苔都没有剩余。
Generally 11 to 12 noon dishes are gone, cucumber left over half, garlic and ginger left, cabbage, cabbage, cabbage, garland ramen, cabbage, lettuce, moss are not left.
有时候挂面、火腿肠、水饺、汤圆也没有，方便面架子是空的，肉的价格翻倍，排骨要靠抢。
Sometimes noodles, ham sausages, dumplings, dumplings, dumplings, dumplings are not available, instant noodles shelves are empty, meat prices double, ribs to be robbed.
“这几天好一些，但是去晚了鸡翅之类的也没有。
"It's better these days, but we're late for the chicken wing or something.
”84消毒液、酒精等消毒用品则一直很难采购到。
Sterilization, such as disinfectants and alcohol, has been difficult to procure.
因为缺菜，辛野每天早上会赶十点超市开门去买菜，“尽量给别人带全”，单子上写着“一斤西红柿”，他会把袋子装满，称下来可能有三斤，“菜紧缺，既然带一次，就多带一点。
Because of lack of food, Sinno would open the door of the supermarket at 10 o'clock every morning to buy food. "Bring it all," it said, "a kilo of tomatoes." He would fill the bag and weigh it down.
”大家都在抢菜，甚至是抢别人推车里的菜。
"Everyone was scrambling for food, even from someone else's cart.
辛野要一次买几个家庭的菜，东西多，不能一直推着购物车，他说，经常发生的事情是，去拿菜的时候，称好的肉被拿走了，去拿肉的时候，菜又被别人拿走了。
Sinnon wants to buy several family dishes at a time, too much to keep pushing the cart, he said. What often happens is that when you go to get the meat, the meat is taken away, and the food is taken away by someone else.
去超市次数多了，和店员也熟络了。
I went to the supermarket a lot and got acquainted with the clerk.
辛野会一次买好几家人的菜，让超市里测体温的姐姐帮忙看着。
Sinnon buys several people's dishes at a time and asks her sister, who takes her temperature at the supermarket, to watch.
晚上11点依然有人点单。
The order is still open at 11: 00 p.m.
“有活的鲈鱼吗？”他回复：“只有冻的鲈鱼要不要？”这是辛野去超市一次的常规带菜量，足够几个家庭一段时间的伙食辛野买菜的小粉车，上面贴满了“七龙珠”、“进击的巨人”等动漫贴纸，他说当初专门挑了这个颜色，全武汉可能就这一台，“你见过我的车，就绝望不了。
"Living perch?" He replied: "Only frozen perch?" This is Sinnon's regular food to the supermarket, a few families for a period of time, Xingye buy food powder cars, covered with "seven dragon beads," "the giant attack," and other animation stickers, he said that the entire Wuhan may have chosen this color, "you have seen my car, despair.
”电动车没电时，辛野就开一辆共享单车继续送菜疫情世象万花筒辛野送菜送货时穿着自己的衣服，很多人都要求辛野把东西放在楼下或门口，所以大部分住户不知道他并不是专业骑手。
When the electric car ran out of electricity, Sinno drove a shared bicycle and continued to deliver food - the kaleidoscope - wearing his own clothes for delivery, and many people asked Sino to keep things downstairs or in front of the door, so most households did not know he wasn't a professional rider.
因为路上不方便去厕所，他尽量忍着不喝水，早上一般9点45分出门，晚上赶在电动车没电之前到家，一般是7点前。
As the road is not convenient to go to the toilet, he tried not to drink water, generally at 9: 45 in the morning, in the evening before the electric car ran out of electricity, usually before 7 o'clock.
疫情爆发以来，武汉这座城市的气氛，以及武汉人的生存状态都发生了很大的变化。
Since the outbreak of the outbreak, Wuhan, the atmosphere of the city, as well as the survival of Wuhan people have undergone great changes.
他会感受到了温暖，例如一开始自己戴的是防雾霾口罩，后来有热心的朋友给了他几个防病毒的KN95口罩，“终于有了像样的口罩了”。
He would feel warm, such as wearing a haze mask at first, but then a warm friend gave him a few anti-virus KN95 masks, "and finally got a decent mask."
他也会收到“辛苦了”这样的信息。
He will also receive the message of "toil."
保利某住宅楼盘下，保安人员“全副武装”，穿戴防护服、护目镜。
Poly a residential property, security personnel "fully armed," wearing protective clothing, goggles.
辛野说，武汉有这么好防护装备的小区不多，金地、保利等大牌小区装备好，老小区普遍没有保安，大门紧锁普通小区的门禁采购路上，辛野拍下的疫情救援车，包括门诊车、物资车、医技保障车，三辆车就是一个临时医院但他也发现，武汉病了，武汉人的精神状态也没有那么好，“大家感觉没什么希望，没有了朝气蓬勃的、开心的感觉。
Wuhan has such good protective equipment, small areas such as gold, Poly and other large-name equipment, the old residential areas generally no security, the door locked the general area, Xinno shooting of the epidemic relief vehicles, including outpatient cars, goods vehicles, medical technology support vehicles, but he also found that Wuhan sick, Wuhan people's mental state is not so good, "people feel no hope, no vibrant, happy feeling.
”在超市里时间长，超市成了辛野观察人情冷暖的万花筒。
In the supermarket, where time is long, the supermarket becomes a kaleidoscope of observation.
多数超市未开门，开业的超市里人手不够，员工大多未到岗，为数不多的在岗工作人员很辛苦，五个人的工作量一个人干，在超市里采购的人又多，超市员工没时间吃饭，没时间上厕所。
Most of the supermarkets are not open, there are not enough staff in the open supermarkets, most of the staff are not on duty, the few staff on duty are very hard-working, there are five people doing their jobs alone, there are more people shopping in supermarkets, and supermarket staff have no time to eat or use the toilet.
“最明显的是，人们更容易激动，情绪更容易爆发了。
"Most obviously, people are more likely to get excited and their emotions to explode.
”他说。
'he said.
在辛野经常买东西的悦活里，人们需要依靠十多台自助结账台结账，但自助结账机经常出问题，即使放了东西在称重台上，称重台也会出现一直报错的情况，发出刺耳的响声，十几台机器由一个阿姨负责解码重置。
In Xinno's delight of shopping, people rely on more than a dozen checkout counters, but there are frequent problems with the checkout machine, and even when things are placed on the weighing table, the weighing tables are constantly misreported, making harsh noises, and dozens of machines are decoded and reset by an aunt.
有一次，一位40多岁的男士扫了几次商品，总是报错，他突然发怒，把台上车厘子等盒装的水果推下台子，撒了一地都是，超市的工作人员和其他购物者都不敢说啥。
On one occasion, a man in his 40s, who had swept the items several times and was always misreporting, suddenly got angry and pushed boxes of fruit, such as cupboards, down the counter and scattered them all over the place. The supermarket staff and other shoppers dared not say anything.
辛野觉得，在这样的非常时期，专注于做事，而不是一味发泄情绪，是缓解焦虑的方法。
Xino feels that in these times of stress, focusing on doing things instead of letting off steam is the way to relieve anxiety.
他也不转发“负能量”文章，觉得有些文章会让人越来越偏激，而问题还是问题，得不到解决，他愿意做点实际的事，让武汉人感到一些温暖。
He also does not forward "negative energy" articles, feel that some articles will be more extreme, and the problem is still unresolved, he is willing to do something practical, let Wuhan people feel some warmth.
“如果你想做点事，在做好防护的情况下，可以做很多好事，哪怕帮助到一个人也好。
"If you want to do something, there are many good things you can do with protection, even if it helps a person.
”他说，跑腿平台上每天都有医生和家属下单求代买84消毒液、酒精、喷壶，单子多得接不过来，如果是身强体壮的年轻人，你愿意注册骑手，哪怕接一单，也是帮人们解决了一个问题，下楼买菜的时候，可以主动帮邻居里的老人或者孕妇带一点。
He said doctors and family members placed daily orders to buy 84 disinfectants, alcohol and watering cans on the runways. If you were a strong young man, you would register as a rider, even one after another, and go downstairs and help out with the elderly or pregnant women in the neighborhood.
另外，很多社区都有确诊、疑似患者，社区人手有限，实在忙不过来，有车的人可以帮社区运输物资，没车的人也可以物资来了帮社区分发，或者主动做给社区消毒的事。
In addition, many communities have confirmed, suspected patients, community hands are limited, really busy, people can help the community transport goods, people without cars can come to help the community to distribute, or initiative to do community disinfection.
“这些事情和在网上转发文章，体现正义感不一样，你能真实地帮到别人。
"These things are not the same as forwarding articles on the Internet to show a sense of justice. You can really help others.
”一位南京网友给辛野发来用枯树叶拼出的“武汉！”此时依然是疫情攻坚期，春天还未来到，所有人都在以自己的方式，陪武汉走向新生。
"Wuhan!," a netizen from Nanjing, sent a piece of "Wuhan!" composed of dead leaves. "This is still the critical period of the epidemic and the spring is coming.
辛野说疫情结束后，他最想做的事情是看画展。
After the outbreak ended, Sinno said, he wanted to see a picture show.
“清明前后，武汉的樱花也开了，欢迎大家来武汉看樱花。
"Around the Qingming Festival, Wuhan cherry blossoms also opened, welcome to Wuhan to see cherry blossoms.
