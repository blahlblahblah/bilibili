如果有人告诉你“在疫情之后全面数字化可以保证让你变得更强大”，建议你先拉黑他张影 | 文2020年2月10日，在深圳平安金融中心，企业员工在楼下使用笔记本电脑连接公司内网下载安装远程办公软件，以便实现居家“云办公”。
If someone tells you that "full digitization after an epidemic can make you stronger," it is recommended that you first blacken him or her. At Shenzhen's Ping An Financial Center, on February 10, 2020, employees use laptops downstairs to connect to company intranets to download and install telecommuting software to make your home office a reality.

它带来了商业企业对数字化态度的转变：从“附加值逻辑”到“必选项逻辑”。
It has led to a shift in business attitudes toward digitization: from "value-added logic" to "must-choose logic."
疫情使各行各业受到不同程度的冲击，而那些数字化程度较高的企业，展现了更灵活的应对能力、更坚实的抵御实力，以及更强劲的生存韧性。
The epidemic has hit industries with varying degrees of impact, while more digitalized businesses have demonstrated greater flexibility, resilience and resilience.
但在后疫情时代，数字化能拯救企业吗？如果有人告诉你“在疫情之后全面数字化可以保证让你变得更强大”，建议你先拉黑他。
But in the post-epidemic era, can digitalization save businesses? If someone tells you that "full digitization after an epidemic will make you stronger," you might want to blacken him first.
这句话的谬误之处在于，它将数字化盲目化、万能化了。
The fallacy of this statement is that it blinds digitization and makes it omnipotent.
对于企业而言，先要找到正确的路径，才能真正地、全面地从数字化中受益。
To the enterprise, must first find the correct path, can truly, fully benefit from the digitization.
究竟选择由需求驱动的“从外到内”的数字化，还是由流程驱动的“从内到外”的数字化，不同企业有不同的答案。
Whether to choose between demand-driven "from the outside to the inside" digitization, or process-driven "from the inside out" digitalization, different companies have different answers.
找到“痛点”再着手推动从网红带货到数字货币，再到如今的大规模在线协同办公，很多人以为数字化大戏已经上演了一出又一出。
Finding the "pain point" and moving on from red tape to digital money to mass online co-location today has led many to believe that digital drama has been staged one after another.
其实，这些只不过是序曲，数字化的正剧才刚要开幕。
In fact, these are just prelude, digital drama just about to start.
数字化如同哈姆雷特，一千个人心中就有一千种理解。
Digitization is like Hamlet. There is a thousand kinds of understanding in a thousand people.
但数字化的核心逻辑是一致的，即通过触点数字化、业务在线化的方式，将外部需求和企业内部行为转化为可运算的数字，并在此基础上通过算法提升供需的匹配效率和质量，进而提升企业的竞争力。
But the core logic of digitization is the same, that is, through the contact digitalization, on-line business, the external demand and the internal behavior of enterprises into operational figures, and on the basis of this, through the algorithm to improve the efficiency and quality of supply and demand, and thus enhance the competitiveness of enterprises.
一个数字化的企业，应该是以数据为决策核心，以算法和智能化为重要决策工具的新型组织。
A digital enterprise should be a new organization with data as its core and algorithm and intelligence as important decision tools.
当数以亿计的企业都实现了这一“存在方式”的质的改变，数字化便彻底改写了商业世界竞争的基础逻辑，也改变了科技社会的生产关系。
When hundreds of millions of businesses have achieved this qualitative change in their "way of being," digitization has revolutionized the basic logic of competition in the business world, as well as the productive relationships in the technological world.
这或许才是数字化的“正剧”。
This may be the "real drama" of digitization.
无论是当下，还是在疫情结束后，对于任何一个企业来说，要不要数字化，在什么时间点以什么样的方式完成数字化，其实都取决于对一个核心问题的回答：目前的企业局面和业务阶段，有哪些决策可以通过运算来帮助优化？不积跬步，何谈千里？对任何一个传统企业来说，都需要迈出数字化的第一步，才能逐步实现整个企业的数字化。
Whether it is now or after the epidemic, whether it is digitized, at what point and in what way, depends on the answer to the central question: What decisions can be made to help optimize in the current business environment and phase of operations?
我们看到，从电子会员、电商运营、自动化渠道管理，到数字金融、在线协同办公，这些单个层面对数字工具的运用，都是企业真正数字化的前期工作，也是不可或缺的探索与实践。
From e-member, electric business operation, automatic channel management, to digital finance, on-line co-operation, these single-level application of digital tools, are all the pre-work of real digitization of enterprises, as well as indispensable exploration and practice.
与此同时，企业的数字化也并非一时一事。
At the same time, digitization of enterprises is not a one-off event.
它是一个长期的过程，牵涉到从经营理念到组织结构的变化，不可能一蹴而就。
It is a long-term process, involving changes from business philosophy to organizational structure, which cannot be accomplished overnight.
更重要的是，并不是所有企业，在每一个发展阶段，在各个业务环节、方向上都需要数字化。
More importantly, not all businesses need to be digitized at every stage of their development, in every business segment and direction.
企业自身发展阶段不同，演进历史不同，决定了它们当下的需求不同，所以并不存在一个具有普适性的数字化路径。
There is no universal digital path because enterprises have different stages of development and different evolution history, which determines their different needs at present.
每个企业需要做的，是寻找投入产出比最高的环节作为切入点，去推动企业的数字化进程。
What every enterprise needs to do is to find the highest input-output ratio as an entry point to promote the digitization process of enterprises.
更进一步地说，尽管数字化最终将改造企业的方方面面，但真正从数字化中获取收益需要整个系统的配合，正面的效果大多会在相对较长的周期内显现。
Moreover, while digitalization will ultimately transform every aspect of the enterprise, truly reaping the benefits from digitization will require the collaboration of the entire system, with most of the positive effects occurring over a relatively long period of time.
事实上，对于很多组织来说，数字化从短期来看收效甚微，甚至因为流程和组织的改变，在很大程度上是成本大于收益的。
In fact, for many organizations, digitization can be of little benefit in the short term, and even because of process and organizational changes, costs outweigh benefits to a large extent.
然而，全社会数字化的未来不可避免，在疫情之后恢复的过程中，企业应该有针对性地着手推动数字化进程，才能让企业在数字化的社会中更具竞争力。
However, the digital future of the whole society is inevitable. In the process of recovering from the epidemic, enterprises should start the digitization process so as to make the enterprises more competitive in the digital society.
两个抓手、两种路径疫情给企业带来了巨大冲击，但同时也带来了更加坚定的数字化信念，带来了变革的机会。
Two grips, two paths of the epidemic brought great impact to the enterprise, but also brought more firm digital faith, brought about the opportunity for change.
对大多数企业来说，如何真正利用数字化渡过疫情之后的难关，通常从两个方面出发效果最为显著：一是利用数字化手段提升内部响应效率；二是利用数字化手段接触到更多的消费者，并与他们产生更多互动。
For most businesses, how to really use digitalization to survive an epidemic is usually most effective in two ways: using digital means to improve internal response efficiency; and using digital means to reach more consumers and interact more with them.
企业内部效率的损失很大程度上来源于信息不同步。
The loss of internal efficiency of enterprises is largely due to the lack of information synchronization.
而数字化最大的特征，就在于信息的可复制性、可运算性和无可比拟的传播速度。
And the biggest characteristic of digitalization lies in the replicability, computability and incomparable propagation speed of information.
对响应速度有高要求的企业，无论是销售响应市场要求快速调整，还是生产决策要求与销售极速匹配，从内部信息同步的数字化上入手，通常是一个重要的突破口。
For enterprises with high response speed, whether the sales respond to market demands or production decision-making requirements and sales speed matching, starting with the internal information synchronization digitalization, is usually an important breakthrough.
以数字办公平台为例：虽然人们通常熟悉的场景是即时通讯、文档协作和远程会议等，但从核心逻辑上理解，这些其实都是通过行为的在线化，提高信息同步和传播效率的手段。
Consider the digital office platform: while the familiar scenarios are instant messaging, document collaboration, and teleconferencing, these are, at the core of the logic, ways to improve the synchronization and dissemination of information via online behavior.
当企业内部的行为全部在线化之后，数据便可以在多人员、多部门、多流程间达到同步和共享，整个公司对内和对外的反应速度就大大加快了。
When the behavior within the enterprise is fully online, the data can be synchronized and shared among multiple people, departments, and processes, and the response time of the whole company both internally and externally is greatly accelerated.
不管是从经销商到仓库，甚至到生产决策者，当信息同步可以实时完成，决策的效率就有可能明显提高。
Whether from a dealer to a warehouse or even to a production decision maker, when information synchronization can be accomplished in real time, the efficiency of decision-making can be significantly improved.
对于以周转和效率为先，以及需要对市场作出快速反应的企业，企业内部业务在线化的效用无疑是非常明显的。
The utility of on-line intra-firm business is clearly evident for companies that prioritize turnover and efficiency and need to react quickly to the market.
数字化变革的另一个抓手，是利用数字化手段接触到更多消费者，并与他们产生更多互动，电商的发展就是其中一个很重要的例子。
Another important example of the digital revolution is the use of digital means to reach more consumers and interact more with them.
通过电商平台，品牌第一次直接和终端消费者产生了关系，触达到了大量以前靠品牌本身无法触达的消费者，也有了更多的工具与他们产生互动。
For the first time, brands are directly associated with end-users through the e-commerce platform, reaching a large number of consumers previously unreachable by the brand itself, and with more tools to interact with them.
更重要的是，消费者行为的持续数字化，也让品牌对消费者的了解更加深入，获取到了以前无法获取的洞察。
More importantly, the continuous digitalization of consumer behavior has also given brands a deeper understanding of consumers and access to insights previously unavailable.
技术的进步加深了品牌与消费者的联系，降低了品牌的获客难度，同时也让品牌触达和满足消费者的工作更加有针对性，从而反馈到内部决策，使得决策更高效、更科学。
Advances in technology have deepened the links between brands and consumers, made branding less difficult for customers, and made brand engagement and consumer satisfaction more targeted, thus feeding back into internal decision-making, making decision-making more efficient and scientific.
也就是说，思考如何利用外部的平台和数据，去触达消费者并与其深度互动，进而提升消费者对品牌的认知、喜好和转化，这对于恢复期的企业来说是另外一个在短期内相对容易见效的方法。
That is, thinking about how to use external platforms and data to reach and interact with consumers in depth, thereby increasing consumer awareness, preferences, and transformation, is another relatively easy way for convalescent companies to do so in the short term.
以上提到的两个不同的数字化出发点，实质上反映的是企业数字化的两条不同路径：一条从外到内的数字化，由需求驱动；另外一条是从内到外的数字化，由流程驱动。
The two different digital starting points mentioned above essentially reflect two different paths of enterprise digitization: one from the outside, which is demand-driven, and the other from internal to external, which is process-driven.
从外到内的数字化，顾名思义，是从需求的数字化入手，从掌握顾客信息，采用数字化的手段与顾客互动，积累消费者资产作为数字化的第一步，逐渐让内部管理和流程适应这个部分，进而达到整个企业的数字化。
As the name implies, digitization begins with the digitization of demand, moves from customer information, uses digitization to interact with customers, accumulates consumer assets as the first step in digitization, and gradually adapts internal management and processes to this part, thus achieving enterprise-wide digitization.
相反，从内到外的数字化，是从利用数字化的工具理顺企业内部的流程为着手点，借此提高决策效率，从而更好地适应外部的需求。
On the contrary, digitization from the inside out starts with the use of digitized tools to streamline processes within the enterprise, thereby increasing the efficiency of decision-making and thus better adapting to external needs.
前者的主要优点是，需求的数字化早期在很大程度上可以和企业的内部管理区隔开来。
The main advantage of the former is that the early digitization of requirements can be largely separated from the enterprise's internal management area.
正因为需求产生在外部平台上，所以通过各种第三方数据整合商或者提供商，每一家企业都可以很快在需求端逐渐开始实现数字化，通过数据思维做运营决策，而不用担心数字化对内部结构和流程在早期产生的巨大影响。
Because demand is generated on an external platform, through a variety of third-party data integrators or providers, every enterprise can quickly begin to digitize on the demand side and make operational decisions through data thinking without worrying about the huge early impact of digitization on internal structures and processes.
而后者的优势是能更快、更坚定地将数字化这一思维方式推广到整个组织，从而改变决策流程，并更及时、准确地对外部市场作出反应，为组织真正转型为数字化组织打下更加牢固的基础。
The latter has the advantage of being able to extend the digital mindset to the entire Organization faster and more firmly, thereby changing the decision-making process and responding to external markets in a more timely and accurate manner, laying a more solid foundation for a genuine organizational transformation into a digital organization.
无论出发点在哪里，其最终目的都应该是全社会全链路的数字化，并在此基础上改变组织结构，真正适应数字化带来的生产关系的改变。
No matter where the starting point is, the ultimate goal should be the digitization of the whole link of the whole society, and then change the organization structure to adapt to the change of production relationship brought by digitization.
数字化不是一个技术问题，从根本上来说，它反映的是新技术环境下生产关系的问题，如同企业所有其他决策一样，它的出发点应该永远都是客户需求，而不是外部竞争。
Digitization is not a technical issue. Fundamentally, it reflects the issue of relations of production in a new technological environment. Like all other enterprise decisions, its starting point should always be customer demand, not external competition.
所以数字化拯救企业的方法，绝不只是依靠“鲶鱼效应”。
So the way to save businesses digitally is not just by relying on the catfish effect.
为了数字化的数字化并没有意义。
There is no point in digitizing for digital purposes.
对于任何企业来说，只有在诚实地回答“我明天的业务究竟需要什么样的数字化”这个现实问题的基础上，才能走出一条适合自己的数字化道路，企业才能真正通过数字化变得强大，实现增长。
For any company, only by honestly answering the practical question of "what kind of digitization does my business need tomorrow" will it be able to take a digital path that suits itself, so that companies can truly grow stronger and stronger through digitization.
美学拯救世界，“逆行者”拯救疫情，数字化拯救企业，但前提是企业找到正确的路径。
Aesthetics saves the world, "Reverse Walker" rescues the epidemic, digitizes saves the enterprise, but only if the enterprise finds the right path.
