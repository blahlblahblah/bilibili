对于“爆红”汪勇并不在意，作为一个组局的人，他还不能停下脚步。
For the "red" Wang Yong does not care, as a group of people, he can not stop.
记者 | 吴　雪“快递小哥”汪勇，一夜之间成为了“网红”。
Reporter & # 124; Wu Xue "express brother" Wang Yong, overnight became "net red."
报道发出后，新民周刊接到了数千位热心读者的留言，纷纷表示要捐款捐物。
After the report was released, Xinmin Weekly received messages from thousands of eager readers saying they would donate money and goods.
目前，我们已经成立专项小组对接捐赠物资事宜。
At present, we have set up a special team to donate materials.
事实上，汪勇对于“爆红”并不在意，作为一个组局的人，他还不能停下脚步。
In fact, Wang Yong does not care about the "red", as a group of people, he can not stop.
2月2日，汪勇发布朋友圈写道：这么多天我扛住了，但护士的一句关心让我泪流不止2月16日早上六点，武汉大雪，汪勇简单垫了垫肚子，发动了停在外面的汽车，开始了一天的工作。
On February 2, Wang Yong issued a circle of friends wrote: So many days I carried, but a nurse's concern let me tears more than February 16 6 a.m., Wuhan snow, Wang Yong simply cushion the stomach, launched parked cars, began a day of work.
“今天武汉下雪，不好叫车，早上七点我送了一名医护人员上班。
"It snowed in Wuhan today. It was hard to get a taxi. I sent a paramedics to work at 7 a.m.
”汪勇说，自从滴滴、青桔单车、摩拜单车介入后，医护人员出行基本满足，如果不是极端天气等特殊情况，大家都不愿意开口麻烦他。
"Since drip-dripping, blueberry cycling and motor-bike riding has taken place, medical staff have been largely satisfied, and no one would have bothered to ask him if it hadn't been for extreme weather conditions.
青桔单车在武汉市金银潭医院投放服务点早上8点钟，汪勇要帮助一位求助到周刊的读者施女士，37岁的施女士身份有些特殊。
At 8 a.m., Wang Yong wanted to help Ms. Shi, a reader who had asked for help from a weekly magazine. Ms. Shi, 37, had a special status.
她既是一名新冠肺炎患者，也是金银潭医院首位捐献血浆的康复患者。
She is both a New Crown Pneumonia patient and the first convalescent patient to donate plasma from the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital.
2月9日，刚刚从武汉一家定点收治医院痊愈出院。
February 9, has just recovered from a designated Wuhan hospital discharged.
施女士说，与她一样罹患新冠肺炎的父亲被告知2月16日在金银潭医院去世，她作为亲属，要去医院办理相关手续和收拾父亲的遗物。
Ms. Shi said her father, who shares her pneumonia, was told she died on Feb. 16 at the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital, where she, as a relative, had to go to the hospital to go through the formalities and collect her father's belongings.
2月15日，施女士正在武汉金银潭医院捐赠血浆施女士的家在江岸区花桥社区，社区派不来车子接送。
On February 15, Ms. Shi is donating plasma at Wuhan Gold & amp; Silver Pool Hospital in Huaxiao district, Jiangxi province.
汪勇得知后，爽快地答应帮忙。
When Wang Yong heard about it, he readily promised to help.
汪勇说为了降低感染风险不建议志愿者车队接送已经康复的施女士，但自己可以想办法从金银潭医院附近开车拖一辆青桔单车过去。
Wang Yong said that to reduce the risk of infection, volunteers would not be advised to take Ms. Shi, who had already recovered, but he could find a way to tow a turquoise bike from near the Golden Pool Hospital.
“拖单车过去的时候，实际上超出了服务范围，解不了锁，我打电话给青桔单车，对方核实二维码后，很快就解决了。
"When I was towing the bike, it was actually out of service and I couldn't unlock it. I called up the tangerine cycle and verified the two-dimensional code, and it was quickly resolved.
”汪勇告诉《新民周刊》，当时他得知施女士的情况，心里很难过，还送了她N95的口罩和一瓶酒精。
Wang told Xinmin Weekly that he was upset to learn about Ms. Shi and gave her a N95 mask and a bottle of alcohol.
搞定这两件事，只是汪勇一天工作的开始。
Finishing these two things is just the beginning of Wang Yong's day's work.
2月15日，汪勇采购了200份洗护用品，放在全国驰援武汉的医疗队入住的三家酒店前台分发，一下子被秒，细心的他发现用量远远不够。
On February 15, Wang Yong bought 200 toiletries and distributed them to the front desk of the three hotels where Wuhan medical team was staying.
于是16日，他在朋友圈发布了采购信息：牙刷500支，牙膏200支，沐浴露、洗发水200瓶。
So on the 16th, he announced his purchases in a circle of friends: 500 toothbrushes, 200 tubes of toothpaste, 200 bottles of shower gel and shampoo.
汪勇说，报道发出后，周刊读者已经捐赠了洗漱用品每样1000份，但正在路上。
Wang Yong said that after the report, weekly readers had donated 1,000 copies of toiletries each, but were on their way.
在此之前，他要保证牙膏每人一支，香皂每人一个，洗发水两个房间一瓶。
Before that, he had to make sure that each person had one toothpaste, one soap and two shampoo bottles.
医护人员入住的维也纳酒店极地海洋世界店前台洗漱用品自助领取点而就在当天，一位叫“素素”的读者也求助到周刊，看到上海驰援武汉医疗队的初中同学成亚慧，发布朋友圈说：无数次抬手帮患者挂水、换药，肩膀疼痛难忍，急需肩周炎药膏。
On the very same day, a reader named Su-su, who lives at the Polar Ocean World Hotel in Vienna, asked for help from his friend Cheng Yahui, a junior high school student from the Shanghai medical team who rushed to Wuhan to help patients hang up the water, change medicine, shoulder pain, urgent need of periarthritis ointment.
想请汪勇帮忙，汪勇联系上这位护士后，竟然发现肩周炎药膏是金银潭医护人员的共性需求。
Want to ask Wang Yong to help, Wang Yong contact the nurse, unexpectedly found that periarthritis of shoulder ointment is the common needs of gold and silver pool medical staff.
“原来很多人都需要，可能她们不想麻烦我，我买了30盒放在了前台，一盒5片，供她们自助领取。
Maybe they didn't want to bother me. I bought 30 boxes of them at the front desk and a box of five for them to collect on their own.
”素素说成亚慧每天照顾病人特别忙，有时候微信消息两天才回复成亚慧发朋友圈说药膏不够用到了午饭时间，汪勇吃着盒饭，大脑却没停下来休息。
"Su said Cheng was very busy taking care of her patients every day, and sometimes it took two days for the message to get back to her friends.
在汪勇的口述中，金釜山餐厅被关闭后，提到武汉一家本地企业“Today便利店”解决了用餐问题。
After Wang Yong's dictation, the Busan restaurant was closed, citing a local Wuhan company, Today Convenience, that solved the dining problem.
汪勇告诉《新民周刊》记者，Today便利店的工厂位于武汉市黄陂区武户农场一家工业园区，由于该地区疫情严重，近两天政府严格管控人员进出，如果照此下去，该园区很可能有关闭风险。
Wang told Xinmin Weekly that Today convenience store's factory is located in an industrial park of Wuhu farm in Huangpi District of Wuhan. Due to the serious epidemic in this area, the government has strictly controlled the entry and exit of personnel for the past two days.
“每天提供1.5万份盒饭的工厂，万一关闭，我得提前想办法填补缺口。
"I have to figure out a way to fill the gap in the event of closure of the 15,000 boxes of rice that are served every day.
”中午12点，汪勇边吃饭，边在脑海中开启了“备选方案”的筹划：该怎么填，以什么方式填。
At 12 noon, Wang Yongbyon ate, opening his mind to the "alternatives" plan: how to fill it in and how to fill it in.
很快，汪勇有了初步的思路，他决定用泡面、鸡蛋、火腿肠等快消品顶上去。
Soon, Wang Yong had a preliminary idea, he decided to use bubble noodles, eggs, sausage and other fast disappearing products top.
“这些物品不像熟食，它不受时间和运输条件的限制，不存在配送滞后的问题。
"These goods are not like cooked food, it is not limited by time and transportation conditions, there is no delivery lag.
”Today便利店提供的盒饭汪勇一边发布朋友圈寻找成本价商品，要求泡鸡蛋和火腿肠，每样7万份现货；一边对接Today便利店，拿到了每个医院的详细配送单。
Boxed lunch from Today's convenience store Wang Yong posted circles of friends looking for cost items, asking for 70,000 ready-made eggs and sausages, while docking with Today convenience stores to get detailed distribution lists for each hospital.
接下来，汪勇开始安排志愿者会计，根据配送数量、配送区域把所有信息区域化，按照一台车送300份的标准，计算出每个区域需要多少台车。
Next, Wang Yong began to arrange volunteer accounting, according to the number of distribution, distribution areas regionalized all information, according to the standard of a car to send 300, calculated the number of vehicles needed in each region.
“2个小时之内，我们找到了20台车，其中2辆面包车，多辆小轿车，下午两点，我已经把上游货源和末端的派送全部打通了。
"In two hours we found 20 cars, two vans, several cars, and at 2: 00 in the afternoon I had all the upstream supply and terminal delivery.
”这时，汪勇的心总算放下了一半。
"Wang Yong's heart was at last half-relieved.
下午两点半，他开始尝试联系工厂仓库所在区域的相关政府部门寻求帮助。
At 2: 30 p.m., he began trying to contact authorities in the area where the warehouse was located for help.
“他们知道影响用餐情况后，响应速度很快，15分钟汇报后就有了回应。
"They knew it would affect the meal and they responded quickly, 15 minutes after the presentation.
”相关负责人表示马上协调处理，全力保障Today便利店工厂生产，之后需要补办一些手续，但可以与工厂生产同时进行。
Executives said they would coordinate their efforts immediately to secure Today's convenience store facilities, which would then have to go through some extra formalities, but could be carried out in parallel with factory production.
事情解决了，傍晚，汪勇兴奋地在朋友圈写道：今天干了一件了不起的事。
It was over, and in the evening Wang Yong excitedly wrote in his circle of friends, "A great thing has been done today."
汪勇告诉《新民周刊》，影响力变大后，他协调沟通事情更顺利了，但许多零碎的事情也占用了很多精力，他表示，还是想把主要精力放在援汉医疗队的对接服务以及紧急医疗物资的募捐和配送的事情上。
Wang told Xinmin Weekly that as his influence increased, he coordinated communication more smoothly, but that many piecemeal tasks absorbed a lot of energy. He said he still wanted to focus on the docking service of the medical support team and the collection and distribution of emergency medical supplies.
Today自有鲜食工厂提供包括便当、热干面、炒饭、三明治、饭团等产品汪勇的心总算完全放下来了。
Today's own fresh food factory provides a variety of products including convenient, hot and dry noodles, fried rice, sandwiches, rice balls and other products Wang Yong's heart finally completely relaxed.
随后，《新民周刊》记者也联系上了Today便利店的负责人，对方表示，政府全力保障企业按计划生产后，仍然存在人力和运力的不足。
Later, Xinmin Weekly reporters contacted Today Convenience, who said the government was fully committed to ensuring that the company was producing as planned and that there was still a shortage of manpower and capacity.
比如，因部分区域道路封禁，运输上可能不及时。
For example, transport may not be timely due to the closure of some regional roads.
武汉很多小区封闭管理之后，工人上班会存在一定的困难，外地工人也无法返城。
Wuhan after the closure of many small areas management, workers will have certain difficulties to work, non-resident workers can not return to the city.
“原则上45个工人上班可以保证供应医院的基本生产，但要每天达到预期20万份盒饭的产能，最起码需要100多个工人，但这是一个技术工种，临时也抓不来人。
"In principle, 45 workers go to work to ensure the basic production of hospitals, but to reach the expected capacity of 200,000 boxes of rice a day requires at least 100 workers, but it is a skilled job that cannot be captured temporarily.
”Today便利店负责人还表示，作为一家创业公司，他们和汪勇一样，也是一个组局者，因为要配餐到武汉市60多家医院，一家力量有限。
Today convenience store chiefs also said they were as much a bureau-builder as Wang, a start-up company, with limited food supplies to more than 60 hospitals in Wuhan.
在他们背后，还有许多爱心企业的参与。
Behind them, there are many caring businesses involved.
比如，Today便利店携手泰合资本、信中利等企业和不愿透露姓名的爱心人士，累计捐赠了1011万元的善款及物资。
Today convenience stores, for example, have donated $10.11 million in donations and supplies to businesses such as Thai Capital, CiZhongli and loving people who do not want to be named.
截止到2月16日，唯品会已持续向金银潭医院捐赠了4058份鲜食，向武汉近60家医院捐赠了547533份鲜食及补给品；朴诚乳业共捐赠了78960瓶简爱酸奶。
As at February 16, the Society had donated 4,058 fresh food items to the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital, 547,533 fresh food and supplies to nearly 60 hospitals in Wuhan, and 78 960 bottles of Jane Eyre yoghurt donated by Park Dairy.
“我们能做的太少了，只能尽一份心意，让一线医护吃上一口热饭。
"We have too little to do but do our part to get a hot bite out of front-line care.
”朴诚乳业提供的奶制品新民周刊在开通“捐赠物资”通道后，北美留学生志愿者团队以及国内几家基金会也主动联系到我们，愿意为武汉一线医护提供帮助。
Following the launch of Donation Channel by Park Chung Dairy, a weekly dairy company, the volunteer corps of North American students and several domestic foundations have approached us to offer help to front-line medical care in Wuhan.
但他们都面临一个共同的难题：物流。
But they all face the same dilemma: logistics.
据北京新阳光基金会志愿者杨帆（化名）介绍，从1月24日，他们先后在国内外进行了21次采购，包括海外南非、日本、印度的货源，存有大批量的口罩、防护服、消毒液以及医疗仪器，对接湖北全省103家医院。
Yang Fan, a volunteer with the New Sunshine Foundation in Beijing, said that from January 24, they made 21 purchases at home and abroad, including supplies from South Africa, Japan and India, and docked 103 hospitals in Hubei Province with large quantities of masks, protective clothing, disinfectant and medical instruments.
但目前的物流只能到达武汉的仓库点，再往下面的黄冈、孝感等医院运输，则需要一两个小时的车程，车辆和司机都太难找到。
But at present, the logistics can only reach Wuhan warehouse point, and then to Huanggang, filial piety and other hospitals, it takes an hour or two to drive, difficult to find vehicles and drivers.
“大货车到达武汉道口，需要城内的团队接应，目前有医疗设备和84消毒液卡在道口，而且进入市区后的物资，找了物流均无法往下配送。
"Large trucks arriving at Wuhan Road junction, the city needs the team to respond, there is currently medical equipment and 84 disinfectant stuck in the intersection, and after entering the city after the material, found logistics can not be distributed.
武汉市物流协会也只解决了消毒柜运输的问题。
Wuhan Logistics Association also only solved the problem of transport of disinfectant cabinet.
”杨帆告诉《新民周刊》。
"Yang Fan told Xinmin Weekly.
快递小哥汪勇2月16日，武汉市民政局慈善事业促进和社会工作处的工作人员张芳，看到新民周刊报道后，主动联系到记者，表示可以以定向捐赠给医院的名义，开具出入城证明；同时她还表示，运送外地的联系上有一些难度，但也可以帮忙协调。
Zhang Fang, a member of the charity promotion and social work department of Wuhan Civil Affairs Bureau, contacted reporters on Feb. 16 and said he could issue a certificate of entry and exit under the name of a targeted donation to the hospital.
夜幕降临了，武汉的江汉大桥上，汪勇开着那辆陪他“战斗”了25天的小汽车，在雪夜中疾驰，手机里不断弹出消息：“汪勇，防护服送到医院了哦”“汪勇，图书已经联系上了供应商”“汪勇，明天下冰雹，我会一早出车。
As night fell, Wang Yong drove the car that had been with him for 25 days on the Wuhan Jianghan Bridge, and messages kept popping up from his cell phone: Wang Yong, the suit was delivered to the hospital. Wang Yong, the book is already in contact with the supplier
”......回到三环外的仓库住处，汪勇停稳了车，没来及洗把脸，又投入到明天的准备工作中。
... returned to the warehouse residence outside the Third Ring Road, Wang Yong stopped his car, did not come and wash his face, and threw himself into the preparations for tomorrow.
凌晨2点，汪勇在仓库那张高低床上安心地睡去，他心想：“这一次，我不再是孤身一人。
At 2 a. m., Wang Yong sleeps peacefully on the high and low bed in the warehouse. "This time, I'm not alone," he thought.
