记者/韩谦魏晓涵编辑/石爱华宋建华进行病理解剖的刘良团队经历了一个多月的等待后，华中科技大学同济医学院法医病理学教授刘良带领的团队，于2月16日凌晨3点50分，完成了第一例新冠肺炎死亡病例的尸体解剖。
After more than a month of waiting, a team led by Liu Liang, professor of forensic pathology at Tongji School of Medicine, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, completed the autopsy of the first case of death from Newcrown Pneumonia at 3: 50 a.m. on February 16.
截止2月25日，专家团队一共完成了11例新冠肺炎死亡病例的病理解剖，其中刘良团队负责了9例，目前已有3例完成了病理的初步诊断。
By February 25, the team of experts had performed pathologic autopsies in 11 cases of death from pneumonia, with Liu Liang's team in charge of 9 cases.
刘良介绍，新冠肺炎的病变与SARS有类似之处，也有自己的特点。
Liu Liang said that the new crown pneumonia lesion and SARS have similarities, but also have their own characteristics.
从目前的病理结果来看，一些死者的肺部切面上，能看到有黏液性的分泌物，他认为这是临床治疗需要警惕的地方——“在治疗上如果黏液成分没有化解，单纯用给氧的方式，可能达不到目的，有时候会起反作用。
According to current pathology, mucous secretions can be seen in the cut of the lungs of some of the deceased, and he believes this is a cautionary place for clinical treatmentsIf mucus ingredients are not resolved, simply giving oxygen may not achieve the goal and may sometimes be counterproductive.
正压给的时候可能会把黏液推得更深更广，会加重患者的缺氧”。
The positive pressure may push the mucus deeper and wider, aggravating the patient's hypoxia. "
日前，刘良教授和华中科技大学同济基础医学院病理学系主任王国平教授一同接受了媒体的采访。
Professor Liu and Professor Wang Guoping, head of the Department of Pathology at Tongji Basic School of Medicine, Central China University of Science and Technology, gave a media interview.
接下来，专家团队会将病理研究的初步结果和临床专家进行对接研究。
The team then docked the preliminary results of the pathologic study with the clinician.
进入手术室进行尸检前需要全面防护遗体捐献者最小52岁记者：针对新冠肺炎的病理解剖工作进行的如何？目前完成了几例解剖？遗体捐赠者情况如何？刘良：从16号到今天为止，我们的团队一共解剖了9例，上海的团队在武汉解剖了两例。
Reporter: How's the pathology of the new crown pneumonia? How about the autopsy? How about the donor? Liu Liang: From the 16th to today, our team has dissected nine cases, and the Shanghai team has dissected two cases in Wuhan.
遗体捐赠者男女比例差不多，年龄偏大，有60岁、70岁、也有80多岁的，最年轻的52岁。
The donors of human remains are almost equally male and female, with a high age of 60, 70, 80 and the youngest 52.
记者：一般来说，想要得出比较科学的结论，需要进行多少例的综合分析？王国平：从科学的角度来讲越多越好，目前一共解剖了11例，还是能在一定程度上说明问题的。
Reporter: Generally speaking, how many cases need to be analyzed in order to draw a more scientific conclusion? Wang Guoping: The more the better from the scientific point of view, the more the better.
记者：接下来会不会倾向于寻找一些较年轻的死亡病例？刘良：病理研究案例是多多益善的，不同的人有不同的个性的问题，（病理解剖研究）就是在个性问题上去找共性的问题。
Reporter: Will there be a tendency to look for younger cases of deathLiu Liang: The case of pathology is more and more good, different people have different personality problems, [pathological anatomy study] is to find common problems in personality problems.
我们希望看到这个病毒在不同的年龄段、不同的性别、不同的身体条件情况下有什么特点。
We would like to see the virus in different age groups, different gender, different physical conditions of what characteristics.
哪些人容易发病，哪些人不容易发病，这个肯定是要往下做。
Which people are prone to disease and which are not, this is definitely going to continue.
记者：尸检工作是在哪里进行的？刘良：这次的尸检工作都是在医院的手术室完成的。
Reporter: Where did the autopsy take place? Liu Liang: The autopsy was done in the operating room of the hospital.
在征求家属意见后，一般来说病人去世6-8个小时后就会展开解剖工作，有的会更晚一些。
After consultation with the family, autopsies are generally carried out six to eight hours after the patient's death, sometimes later.
所有完成尸检的遗体都由殡仪馆的车送去火化。
All the bodies of the autopsy were sent to be cremated by the undertaker's car.
记者：此前，申请研究还是花了不少时间的。
Journalist: Before that, it took a lot of time to apply for research.
目前研究状况是否有所改善，家属态度如何？刘良：尸检一开始确实是花了很多精力，去要政策，还要找医院，还要跟家属做工作，所以相对来说起步比较难。
Liu Liang: The autopsy really started out with a lot of energy, going to the hospital and working with the family, so it was relatively difficult to get started.
通过媒体的宣传，逝者家属也了解了病理解剖的意义，有临床医生跟我反映说，家属接受度比以前好。
Through media campaigns, the families of the deceased were also made aware of the significance of the pathology, and a clinician told me that the acceptance of the family was better than before.
现在，很多医院开始试探性地走这个（在医院进行病理解剖）模式，有不少医院在主动联系开展这个工作。
Now, many hospitals are experimenting with this model, and many hospitals are actively linking up to do it.
我觉得将来不仅是金银潭和同济这两家医院的合作，会更多医院加入进来。
I think that in the future it will be not only the Gold and Silver Pool and Tongji hospitals working together. More hospitals will join us.
病理研究人员对样本进行研究死者肺部有黏液性分泌物记者：目前，是否有已经完成病理研究的案例？有何发现？刘良：有3例病理诊断的初步结果已经出来了，更深入的检查，如免疫组化、特殊染色，还正在抓紧做。
Pathologists have studied samples of mucous secretions from the lungs of the deceased Journalist: Are there any cases where pathologic studies have been completed? Liu Liang: Preliminary results from three pathologic diagnoses have been developed and more intensive examinations such as immunohistochemistry and special staining are underway.
从目前情况看，还是有比较重要的发现，但结论需进一步与临床专家进行沟通，看这些病变是临床上的治疗造成的，还是疾病本身造成的。
At present, there are important findings, but the conclusions need to be further communicated with clinical experts to see if these changes are the result of clinical treatment or the disease itself.
记者：从尸检情况来看，新冠病毒除了侵犯肺部之外，还有哪些器官受累？刘良：新冠肺炎的病变目前看肯定不止损害肺，还包括免疫系统和身体其他器官，具体还要与临床医生交换意见。
Following is a question by the Hon Alan Leong and a written reply by the Secretary for Health, Welfare and Food, Dr York Chow, in the Legislative Council today (May 12): "What are the implications of the new cap virus?
记者：之前钟南山院士说，新冠肺炎患者遗体解剖发现肺的表现并不是严重的纤维化，有一部分肺泡存在，炎症很厉害，有大量的黏液。
Reporter: Earlier, academician Zhong Nan Shan said the autopsy of the coronet pneumonia showed no serious fibrosis in the lungs. Some alveoli were present, inflammation was severe and there was a lot of mucus.
这些表现反映出了什么问题？这些发现对临床治疗有什么帮助？刘良：我们在显微镜下，确实发现有些死者肺部切面上有黏液性的分泌物，这可以提醒临床治疗提高警惕。
What problems did these findings show? Liu Liang: Under a microscope, we did find mucous secretions on the cut surfaces of the lungs of some of the deceased.
肺在人体里是氧气和二氧化碳交换的场所，它的功能依赖于气道通畅，肺泡的功能要好。
The lungs, the places where oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged, depend on airway patency and the alveoli function better.
目前看，肺泡的功能可能受到损伤，气道又被黏液堵住，临床上会出现缺氧的表现。
At present, the alveolar function may be damaged, the airway is blocked by mucus, clinical manifestations of hypoxia will appear.
所以要改善人的缺氧状态，保持气道通畅，必须对黏液进行稀释或者溶解。
Therefore, to improve the lack of oxygen, to maintain airway patency, we must dilute or dissolve mucus.
实际上目前已经使用了这类药物，但可以再多试一试。
These drugs are actually already in use, but try again.
在临床治疗上，如果黏液成分没有化解，单纯用给氧的方式，可能达不到目的，有时候会起反作用。
In the clinical treatment, if the mucus composition is not resolved, the use of oxygen alone may not achieve the goal, and sometimes it will be counterproductive.
正压给氧的时候可能会把黏液推得更深更广，会加重患者的缺氧。
Positive pressure on oxygen may push the mucus deeper and wider, aggravating the patient's hypoxia.
临床上可能也在注意这个事情，但我们觉得还是要强调这个问题。
Clinical attention may also be given to this matter, but we feel compelled to emphasize it.
记者：通过病理检测发现病毒的确切感染部位、主要靶器官，是否可以明确新冠病毒传播机制？刘良：病毒的传播途径目前不是病理上的问题，我们在做前面几例尸检的时候也做了不同器官和组织的核酸检测，是有些发现的，这些问题还需要进一步分析，因为不同病例做出来的结果不太一致。
Reporter: Is it possible to identify the exact infection sites and main target organs of the virus through pathology? Liu Liang: The transmission route of the virus is not a pathological problem at present. We have also made nucleic acid tests on different organs and tissues during the previous autopsy.
记者：之前有学者提出，在一些重症患者中可能会暴发心肌炎或心碎综合征，通过解剖，这种可能性是否存在？刘良：爆发心肌炎问题还待定，还要讨论。
Reporter: Some scholars have suggested that myocarditis or heartbreak syndrome may erupt in some seriously ill patients. Is this a possibility through anatomy? Liu Liang: The outbreak of myocarditis is still to be discussed.
心碎综合征我认为可能性比较小。
Broken Heart Syndrome I think it's less likely.
记者：相关研究显示新冠病毒和SARS的同源性很高，通过遗体解剖，目前发现新冠肺炎的肺部表现和 SARS的区别大吗？有什么不同？刘良：新冠肺炎跟SARS的病变有类似性，但也有它自己的特点，我们后期会做一些解读。
Reporter: Studies have shown that the New Crown Virus and SARS are homologous. Through autopsies on human remains, is it clear that there is a big difference between pneumonia and SARS? Liu Liang: New Crown Pneumonia is similar to SARS, but it has its own characteristics, which we will explain later.
图为身着防护服的刘良教授，他参与了第一例新冠肺炎的解剖工作解剖团队防护物资紧张记者：目前我们的工作中还面临哪些困难？刘良：尸检人员做解剖的防护非常重要，（解剖环境）相当于到辐射浓度最高的地方去。
The picture shows Professor Liu Liang in protective clothing who participated in the anatomy of the first case of new crown pneumonia anatomy team protective materials tight reporter: What difficulties are we facing at present? Liu Liang: It is very important for the autopsy personnel to do the anatomical protection equivalent to going to the place with the highest radiation concentration.
目前为止，防护物资都是我们从其它地方“化缘”来的，希望更多人关注我们这支“特种部队”。
So far, we have come to protect the material from other places, hope more people pay attention to our "special forces."
记者：业界呼吁国内各大中心城市尽快建设符合甲级传染病标准的解剖室，控制及预防烈性传染病的规章制度也应进一步完善，您怎么看？王国平：这次新冠病毒爆发提示我们在学科建设上要重视传染性疾病，特别是甲类传染病标准解剖室的建立，这是我们需要吸取教训的地方。
Following is a question by the Hon Wong Kwok-ping and a written reply by the Secretary for Health, Welfare and Food, Dr York Chow, in the Legislative Council today (April 9): "The Government is committed to promoting the development of a healthy and healthy living environment in Hong Kong.
目前符合这种负压的P2、P3的尸体解剖室，SARS的时候在北京地坛医院和广东见过，其他地方基本没有。
The P2 and P3 autopsy rooms, which currently meet this negative pressure, were seen at the Beijing Ditan Hospital and Guangdong at the time of SARS.
解剖室的问题应该提到议事日程上来，解剖室的不达标会导致解剖工作的延缓。
Anatomical room problems should be on the agenda, and substandard anatomy can lead to delays.
