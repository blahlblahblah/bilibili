近日个别国家和地区确诊病例激增，确诊首例新冠病毒感染病例的国家和地区也在增加，是新感染群体的感染源越来越难以查明？还是疫情传播到了某个新的临界点？文| 金焱编辑|苏琦2020年2月21日，伊朗纳杰夫国际机场，工作人员为旅客测量体温。
The number of confirmed cases has surged in recent days in several countries and regions. Is the number of countries and regions with the first confirmed cases of new infections also increasing, making it increasingly difficult to identify the source of new infections? Or is the outbreak spreading to a new tipping point?
图/法新自1月20日新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情从湖北爆发以来，中国经过一个多月的防控，虽然疫情数据累积不断增长，但近日新增确诊感染人数增速持续下降，治愈出院病例持续增加，疫情蔓延势头初步得到遏制。
Since the outbreak of pneumonia on January 20 by the new coronavirus in Hubei Province, China has, after more than a month of prevention and control, seen a steady decline in the number of newly diagnosed infections, a steady increase in the number of cases cured and an initial halt to the spread of the disease.
而在中国以外，韩国、日本、意大利等地近日出现多起聚集性感染，确诊病例快速增加，疫情在全球蔓延的形势引起各方面高度关注。
Outside China, there have been many cases of conglomerate infection in Korea, Japan and Italy, and the number of confirmed cases has increased rapidly.
同时，从美国到中国，近期股市总体表现强劲，似乎表明疫情对金融市场的冲击有限。
Meanwhile, from the US to China, the recent overall strong performance of stock markets seems to indicate that the epidemic has had limited impact on financial markets.
展望一季度及全年经济增长，国际货币基金组织及一些投资机构近期纷纷发布最新预测，多数认为中国经济有望从二季度开始恢复正常。
Looking ahead to first-quarter and full-year economic growth, the International Monetary Fund and a number of investment agencies recently issued new forecasts, most of which expect China's economy to start returning to normal from the second quarter.
IMF预测中国经济今年增速5.6%2月21日，中共中央政治局召开会议，研究新冠肺炎疫情防控工作，部署统筹做好疫情防控和经济社会发展工作。
The IMF forecast that China's economy will grow 5.6% this year Feb. 21, when the Politburo held a meeting to study the prevention and control of the New Crown Pneumonia epidemic and to plan for the prevention and control of the disease and economic and social development.
中共中央总书记习近平主持会议。
General Secretary Xi Jinping chaired the meeting.
会议指出，目前疫情蔓延势头得到初步遏制，防控工作取得阶段性成效，全国新增确诊病例数和疑似病例数总体呈下降趋势，治愈出院人数较快增长，尤其是湖北以外省份新增病例大幅减少。
The meeting noted that the spread of the epidemic had been initially halted and that the prevention and control efforts had yielded initial results, with the overall downward trend in the number of newly confirmed cases and suspected cases nationwide, and a relatively rapid increase in the number of cured discharges, especially in provinces outside Hubei province.
同时，要清醒看到，全国疫情发展拐点尚未到来，湖北省和武汉市防控形势依然严峻复杂。
At the same time, we should be soberly aware that the inflection point of national epidemic development has not yet arrived.
国家卫健委的数字显示，2月21日0—24时，31个省(自治区、直辖市)和新疆生产建设兵团报告新增确诊病例397例，新增死亡病例109例(湖北106例，河北、上海和新疆生产建设兵团各1例)，新增疑似病例1361例。
Between 0000 and 2400 hours on February 21, the 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps reported 397 new confirmed cases and 109 new deaths (106 in Hubei and 1 each in Hebei, Shanghai and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps), with 1,361 new suspected cases.
值得注意的是，当天新增确诊病例397例比前一天的889例有大幅下跌。
It is worth noting that 397 new cases were confirmed that day, down significantly from 889 the previous day.
2月22日，国际货币基金组织（IMF）总裁克里斯塔利娜•格奥尔基耶娃在利雅得举行的二十国集团财长和央行行长会议上发表声明，“中国当局正在借助危机管理措施、流动性供应、财政措施和资金支持，努力缓解疫情对经济的负面影响。
"The Chinese authorities are trying to mitigate the negative impact of the epidemic through crisis management measures, liquidity provision, fiscal measures and financial support," IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in a statement at a meeting of finance ministers and central bankers in Riyadh.
”IMF今年1月预计全球经济增速将从去年的2.9%加快至今年的3.3%。
The IMF forecast in January that global growth would accelerate to 3.3 per cent this year from 2.9 per cent last year.
此后，COVID-19疫情——全球公共卫生紧急事件——扰乱了中国的经济活动。
Since then, the COVID-19 epidemic - a global public-health emergency - has disrupted economic activity in China.
IMF预测的当前基线情景假设是：中国实施了宣布的措施，且中国经济将在二季度恢复正常。
The IMF's current baseline scenario assumes that China implements the announced measures and that the Chinese economy will return to normal in the second quarter.
因此，未来全球经济受影响的程度可能较小，持续时间可能较短。
As a result, the future impact on the global economy is likely to be small and short-lived.
在这种情景中，2020年中国的经济增速将达到5.6%。
In this scenario, China's economy would grow by 5.6 per cent in 2020.
这相比今年1月的《世界经济展望更新》低0.4个百分点。
This is 0.4 percentage points below the January World Economic Outlook update.
全球经济增速将下降约0.1个百分点。
Growth in the global economy will slow by about 0.1 percentage point.
IMF承认，现在仍在研究病毒传播的复杂性，事态不确定性太强，无法做出可靠的预测。
The IMF acknowledges that it is still studying the complexity of the virus's spread and that the uncertainty is too great to make reliable predictions.
很多情景都可能发生，取决于病毒被遏制以及中国和其他受影响经济体恢复正常的速度。
Many scenarios are possible, depending on how quickly the virus is contained and normalcy returns to China and other affected economies.
近日有调查数据显示，由于公司担心流行病的影响继续发酵，担心新型冠状病毒疫情暴发会减缓全球增长，美国2月份的商业活动跌至六年多以来的最低水平。
Business activity in the United States fell to its lowest level in more than six years in February amid concerns that the impact of the epidemic will continue and that a new coronavirus outbreak could slow global growth, according to recent surveys.
法国外贸银行（NATIXIS）亚太区首席经济学家艾西亚（Alicia Garcia- Herrero）对《财经》记者表示，中国企业恢复生产面临新的障碍，各种措施导致一些公司复工非常缓慢。
Alicia Garcia-Herrero, Asia-Pacific chief economist for the French foreign trade bank (NATIXIS), told Caijing that Chinese companies were facing new obstacles to resuming production and that various measures had led to some companies returning to work very slowly.
有些既便开工生产率也很低，因此会在一定程度上影响供应链。
Some even start-up productivity is low, thus affecting the supply chain to some extent.
虽然中美贸易摩擦中，关税也对供应链产生了影响，但比较起来，此次冠状病毒疫情对供应链的影响更大，因为疫情带来了不确定性，无论是持续的时间还是规模都不确定，而关税不但公开宣布，且规模可衡量。
While tariffs have had an impact on the supply chain in the midst of trade frictions between China and the US, the coronavirus epidemic has had a greater impact on the supply chain, owing to uncertainty about the duration and scale of the outbreak, and the fact that tariffs are not only publicly announced, but also measurable in scale.
中国驻沙特大使在二十国集团财长和央行行长会议上表示，尽管出现疫情，中国依然可以实现今年的经济增长目标。
China's ambassador to Saudi Arabia told a meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors that despite the outbreak, China could still achieve its economic growth target for this year.
世界卫生组织认为，强力和协调的措施仍然能够控制病毒在中国和全球的传播，阻止人类悲剧的延续。
The World Health Organization believes that strong and coordinated measures can still control the spread of the virus in China and around the world and prevent the continuation of human tragedy.
但IMF不排除更严重的情景出现——病毒传播持续时间更长、全球传播范围更广，对经济增长的影响更加持久。
But the IMF does not rule out a more serious scenario - one in which the virus spreads longer, spreads more widely around the world, and has a more lasting impact on economic growth.
全球多地疫情抬头的背后尽管相较而言，中国境外的病例总数为数不多，但近日出现的迹象让人担忧：一方面个别国家确诊病例激增，另一方面确诊首例新冠病毒感染病例的国家也在增加。
Behind the rise in many global outbreaks While the total number of cases outside China is relatively small, there are recent signs of a worrying increase in the number of confirmed cases in individual countries, on the one hand, and in the number of countries confirming the first case of a new crown virus infection, on the other.
是新感染群体的感染源越来越难以查明？还是疫情传播到了某种临界点？世卫组织总干事谭德赛表示，“机会窗口正在缩小，所以我们需要在它完全关闭之前迅速采取行动。
Is it becoming increasingly difficult to identify the source of infection in newly infected populations, or is the epidemic reaching a tipping point? "The window of opportunity is narrowing, so we need to act quickly before it is completely shut down," said WHO Director-General Lindsay.
在谭德赛看来，疫情可能会向任何方向发展，如果做得好，可以避免任何严重的危机，但如果浪费了机会，就会面对一个严重的问题。
In Tandesse's view, the epidemic may be moving in any direction and, if done well, any serious crisis can be averted, but if the opportunity is squandered, there is a serious problem.
韩国在2月19日新增了20例病例，20日新增53例，21日新增100个病例。

至此，韩国17个广域市道均出现病例，疫情呈全面扩散之势。
So far, 17 wide-area city roads in South Korea have seen cases, the spread of the epidemic in all directions.

图/法新同样，新病例在一天内呈数倍激增也发生在欧洲的意大利。
Similarly, the number of new cases surged several times a day in Italy, Europe.
意大利已累计确诊79例新冠病毒肺炎感染病例， 1人治愈出院，2人死亡。
In Italy, a cumulative total of 79 cases of Newcomovirus pneumonia have been diagnosed, one has been cured and two have died.
病例主要集中于北部的伦巴第大区和威尼托大区，意大利沦为欧洲疫情最严重的国家。
Cases are concentrated in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto, with Italy being the most affected country in Europe.
意大利报告的确诊病例曾在一天内从三例增加到17例。

12个城镇遭到封锁，5万多居民被要求留在家中。
Twelve towns were blockaded and more than 50,000 residents were asked to stay at home.
人们相信疫情起源于当地一所医院和一个咖啡馆的感染群。
The outbreak is believed to have originated in a local hospital and an infected group of cafes.
据法新社报道，在距米兰60多公里的科多尼奥，在出现第一例新冠病毒肺炎死亡个案后，已于2月21日开始关闭所有的学校，教堂，体育馆等公共设施。
Cordonio, more than 60 kilometers from Milan, closed all public facilities including schools, churches and stadiums on Feb. 21 after the first death from Newcastle virus pneumonia, AFP reported.
世界卫生组织则明确表示，担心伊朗新冠病毒感染病例近日激增可能是疫情恶化的信号。
The World Health Organization has made it clear that fears of a recent surge in the number of cases could signal a worsening of the epidemic.
伊朗过去两天报告18起感染病例，包括至少5人死亡。
Iran has reported 18 cases of infection in the past two days, including at least five deaths.
这个新感染群始于宗教城市库姆，但不清楚是如何爆发的。
The new infection began in the religious city of Qom, but it is not clear how it happened.
更糟糕的是，黎巴嫩和加拿大已经发现来自伊朗的感染者。
Worse, Lebanon and Canada have already found infections from Iran.
谭德塞说：“我们最大的担忧仍然是2019冠状病毒在卫生系统较弱的国家中传播的可能。
"Our biggest concern remains the potential for 2019 coronavirus to spread in countries with weak health systems," he said.
为此，世卫组织发布了《战略准备和响应计划》，筹集6.75亿美元为最脆弱国家提供特别的支持。
To that end, WHO issued its Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan, which mobilized $675 million to provide special support to the most vulnerable countries.
”疫情在一些国家的恶化主要归绺于聚集性感染。
The deterioration of the epidemic in some countries is mainly concentrated in the form of concentrated infections.
病毒学家对聚集性传播有两种可能的解释。
Virologists have two possible explanations for concentrated sexual transmission.
第一种可能是，一名“超级传播者”——即一名表现出比其他人更高的脱落细菌倾向的人——将病毒传给了一大群人。
The first possibility is that a "super communicator," a person who exhibits a higher propensity to shedding bacteria than others, passes the virus on to a large number of people.
有些超级传播者自己没有症状，因感觉没病出了门，或者他们遇到了一群抵抗力低的人。
Some super-disseminators have no symptoms of their own, feel well out of the door, or they encounter a group of people with low resistance.
以韩国为例，确诊案例中有大约230例直接和新天地耶稣教会在大邱的一个分支教会有关，感染源可能是一名60多岁的妇女，她参加了两次礼拜活动，她后来的病毒检测呈阳性。
In the case of South Korea, for example, about 230 of the confirmed cases were directly related to a branch of the Jesuit community in Taegu in Xintiandi, probably from a woman in her sixties who attended two services and who later tested positive for the virus.
韩国官员目前正在调查是否去过教会的人与清道郡医院感染病例激增有关。
South Korean officials are investigating whether church visits have been linked to a surge in infections in Ching Tao county hospitals.
目前为止清道郡医院有110多人确诊，大部分病患住在医院的精神病区内。
So far, more than 110 people have been diagnosed at Ching Tao County Hospital, most of whom live in the psychiatric ward of the hospital.
韩国卫生与福利部副部长金刚理（Kim Gang-lip)说，韩国的新冠病毒疫情已经进入到严重的新阶段，但是他仍然持谨慎乐观态度。
Kim Gang-lip, South Korea's deputy health and welfare minister, said the country had entered a 'serious new phase' of the new outbreak, but he remained cautiously optimistic.
对聚集性传播的另一种解读是，人们可以各不相关地从被污染的表面感染病毒。
Another interpretation of agglomeration sexual transmission is that people can intimately infect themselves with the virus from contaminated surfaces.
目前还不清楚这种新冠病毒能在表面存活多久，但对其它这类病毒的研究发现，它们的活性能持续一周或更长的时间。
It is not clear how long the new cap virus will survive on the surface, but studies of other such viruses have found that they can remain active for up to a week or more.
虽然最糟糕的情况还未出现，但伊朗和韩国感染病例激增，中东地区的黎巴嫩和以色列21日均报告首例新型冠状病毒感染确诊病例。
While the worst is yet to come, there has been a surge in infections in Iran and South Korea, with Lebanon and Israel in the Middle East reporting the first confirmed cases of a new coronavirus infection.
世界卫生组织总干事谭德塞呼吁国际社会迅速采取应对行动，遏制新冠肺炎疫情蔓延。
World Health Organization Director General Lindsay Tanner calls for a swift international response to stem the spread of pneumonia in the New Crown.
