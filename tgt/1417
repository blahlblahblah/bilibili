她说，年后房价肯定还有一轮上涨，现在买房子的人都是来“捡漏”的，卖房子的人都是“苕”。
She said that there must be another round of house prices after the year, now buyers are to "leak", the sale of people are "Tiaoxia."
配图 | Sipa图片社8年前，我和刘辉在一次校友聚会上结识，后来关系一直处得不错。
Rita Lau and I got to know each other at an alumni party eight years ago, and have been getting along pretty well ever since.
他是湖北孝感人，大学毕业后留在武汉工作，妻子潘文在一家国企上班，儿子已经4岁多了。
He graduated from university and stayed to work in Wuhan. His wife, Pan Wen, works in a state-owned enterprise. His son is over 4 years old.
去年6月份的一天，刘辉说他打算买房，想找人咨询一下武汉楼市状况，便拜托我约一位在房地产公司上班的同学一起吃了个晚饭。
One day last June, Liu said he was going to buy a house. He wanted someone to talk to him about the property market in Wuhan, so he asked me to have dinner with a classmate who works for a real estate company.
酒足饭饱后，刘辉夫妇开车送我回家。
When I was full, Mr. and Mrs. Liu drove me home.
路上，潘文问我近期有没有关注附近XX楼盘的价格，我说，只是偶尔路过时看到楼已经盖好，大幅广告就挂在外面，听说卖得挺火爆，摇号还要交“茶水费”。
On the way, Pan asked me if I had paid attention to the price of XX building nearby. I said that I just saw that the building had been built up occasionally.
潘文点点头，伸出3根手指，“开盘价已经接近3万了，你还不打算买房？”我摇摇头，说武汉限购，我户口不在这儿，没有资格。
Pan nodded and held out three fingers. "The opening price is close to 30, 000. You don't plan to buy a house yet?" I shook my head, saying that Wuhan restricted purchase, my account is not here, not qualified.
“你赶紧想办法把户口弄过来吧，眼瞅着未来房价又要涨。
"You hasten to find a way to hukou over here, watching the future of house prices to rise.
” 刘辉又提醒我。
"Liu Hui reminded me again.
那天之后，刘辉夫妇便开始在武汉各处看房，期间还拉我去做过几次“司机”。
After that day, Mr. and Mrs. Liu Hui began to look around Wuhan, during which time I was pulled to do a few "drivers."
我记得他们在汉口有一套80平米左右的商品房，才住了没几年，就问他为何又要买房。
I remember they have a set of about 80 square meters in Hankou commercial housing, just lived for a few years, asked him why he wanted to buy a house.
他就说儿子快到上学年龄了，结婚时在汉口买的那套房面积有些小，学区也不好，想在武昌找一套好的学区房。
He said that his son is about to go to school age, married in Hankou that suites some small area, school district is not good, want to find a good school district room in Wuchang.
在武汉一年中最炎热的季节，我开车带着他们两口子跑了很多楼盘，足迹遍布武汉三镇。
Wuhan in the hottest season of the year, I drove them and ran a lot of buildings, footprints throughout Wuhan three towns.
有一次，我实在忍不住问他：“又不是没房住，干嘛非赶这大热天出来看房？”刘辉一边擦着脸上的汗一边跟我说，他也不想冒着酷暑出来跑，但过不多久武汉房价就会猛涨，“现在不买，以后更买不起了”。
Once, I could not help asking him: "Not without a house, why not come out to see the house on this hot day?" Liu Hui wiped the sweat on his face and told me that he did not want to run out in the heat, but soon prices in Wuhan would skyrocket.
彼时，坊间确实流传着武汉房价将会暴涨的消息。
Back then, there was real talk that prices in Wuhan would skyrocket.
原因是10月中旬，武汉将承办第七届夏季军人运动会，市政府为此更新了大量的城市设施，兴建了一批举世瞩目的工程，让整个城市面貌焕然一新。
The reason is that in mid-October, Wuhan will host the 7th Summer Military Games, for which the municipal government has renovated a lot of urban facilities and built a batch of projects attracting world-wide attention, which will transform the whole city.
大家按照2008年奥运会和2010年亚运会后，北京和广州两座承办城市房价的涨幅比例推断，军运会之后，武汉房价肯定会迎来新一轮暴涨。
After the 2008 Olympic Games and the 2010 Asian Games, the percentage increase in housing prices in Beijing and Guangzhou, the two cities to calculate, Wuhan after the Games will certainly usher in a new round of soaring.
刘辉手里有一笔存款，加上各种房价上涨的消息乱飞，着实让他跃跃欲试。
With a deposit in his hand and news of rising house prices, Mr. Liu was eager to try.
刘辉告诉我，2015年下半年，自己就没把握住武汉房价暴涨的机会，“这次说什么也不能再吃亏了”。
Liu Hui told me that in the second half of 2015, he did not seize the opportunity of Wuhan prices soaring, "this time said nothing can be lost."
加上身边的同事和亲友们也大多在商量买房的事情，还有好几个同事已经借款买了新房，没买的也在利用周末时间四处看房，刘辉一心觉得，若是耽误了这波行情，真的是平白无故损失了一大笔钱。
Besides, most of my colleagues and friends are talking about buying a house. Some of my colleagues have borrowed money to buy a new house. What I haven't bought is also using my weekend time to look around.
我也很是理解，那段时间，自己手机里也经常收到各处房产开发商的广告消息，连一些三环之外的楼盘，营销顾问预测的单价都要接近每平米2万元了。
I also understand that during that time, their mobile phone often received real estate developers around the news, even some outside the Third Ring Road, the marketing consultant's unit price is close to 20,000 yuan per square meter.
“你看南京的房价，再看武汉的房价，明显低一截，说明还有上涨的空间，这次军运会，恐怕就是武汉追平南京的最后节点了。
"Look at the house prices in Nanjing and Wuhan, obviously lower, there is room for an increase, this military games, I am afraid that Wuhan after the last node of Nanjing.
”潘文也跟着刘辉一起劝我，想一想的确不无道理。
Pan joined Liu Hui in exhorting me to think it was not without reason.
8月中旬，刘辉再次约我吃饭，席间又问我“买不买房”。
In mid-August, Liu Hui invited me to dinner again and asked me if I could buy a house.
我也很无奈，不是不想买，实在是没有本地户口买不了。
I am also very helpless, not want to buy, is really no local account can not buy.
没想到听我这么说，刘辉似乎还有些高兴，接着问我，既然我近期不买房，能不能借他些钱用。
I did not expect to hear this, Liu Hui seems to be a little happy, and then asked me, since I do not buy a house in the near future, can you lend him some money.
“你们不是已经准备好买房的钱了吗，怎么又要借钱？”刘辉赶忙解释说，潘文看中了一套武昌的二手房，面积比较大，180平米，总价接近400万，因为这算“二套房”，按照政策，首付需要缴230万左右，手头的钱就不够了。
"Why should you borrow money when you are ready to buy a house?" Liu explained hurriedly that Pan saw a set of second-hand houses in Wuchang, with a relatively large area of 180 square meters and a total price of nearly 4 million, because this is the "second suite".
他们本来也没打算买这么大的房子，但第一次跟房产中介上门看房，便一下喜欢上了这套——无论房型、地段、学区还是小区配套设施，都很合潘文的心意。
They did not intend to buy such a large house, but for the first time with a real estate agent door-to-door, they fell in love with the set - regardless of the type, location, school district or small area ancillary facilities, are very Pan Wen's mind.
而且房主出国急卖，价格还略低于市场价——刘辉这段时间实在看房看烦了，干脆决定咬咬牙买下来算了。
And the owner went abroad to sell, the price is still slightly lower than the market price - Liu Hui this time really look tired of the house, simply decided to gnash teeth to buy it.
可家里存款只有80多万，首付缺口很大，问了一圈，身边有经济实力的亲戚朋友大多也都在张罗着买房，于是只能找到我。
But the family savings only more than 800,000, the first payment gap is very large, asked a circle, around the economic strength of most of the relatives and friends are also in Zhang Luo buy a house, so can only find me.
为了让我放心，刘辉又解释说，自己父母在孝感老家有一家工厂，效益很好，眼下只是一时半会拿不出这么多现金，“（借）80万，1年，我们按照银行定期利率的3倍付你利息……”我摇摇头，说自己手上也没那么多钱。
In order to reassure me, Liu explained that his parents had a factory in his hometown of filial piety, and the benefits were good. For the time being, we would not be able to provide so much cash.
“40万，半年，3倍利率……”刘辉把金额和时间各压缩了一半，但利息没变。
"400,000, half a year, three times the interest rate..." Liu Hui reduced the amount and time by half, but the interest rate remained unchanged.
我还是摇头——不是不想帮忙，而是手里真的一下拿不出这么多钱。
I shook my head - not because I didn't want to help, but because I couldn't afford to give so much money.
想了想，我决定实话实说——40万确实有些困难，但5、6万还是可以的。
On reflection, I decided to be honest -- 400,000 is a bit difficult, but 50,000 or 60,000 is OK.
也不需要付什么利息，用的话，我马上转账。
I don't need to pay any interest. If you use it, I'll transfer it right away.
我本想多说两句，劝他不要着急买这么贵的房子，毕竟首付之后还有每月贷款，压力太大，但听到我也拿不出那么多钱，刘辉脸上明显有些失望，随即就结束了借钱的话题，我也不好多说。
I wanted to say something more to persuade him not to rush to buy such an expensive house. After all, there was a monthly loan after the down payment, and the pressure was too great.
之后很长一段时间，刘辉都再没跟我提过钱的事情。
After a long time, Liu Hui did not tell me about the money.
本以为他们两口子就此放弃了，但不久后，我在潘文的朋友圈里看到了他们的新房照片，从定位看，正是那套180平的大房子。
I thought the couple had given up, but soon I saw pictures of their new home in Pan's circle of friends, a flat 180-level house.
朋友圈下面全是共同好友们羡慕的点赞和留言，我问刘辉：“搞定了？”刘辉显得十分激动，说搞定了，“太喜欢这套房子了，老婆还说房子够大了，可以准备生二胎了！”刘辉的父母是在上世纪90年代初开始在老家经商的，潘文的娘家经济状况也不错。
"Liu Hui was very excited and said he had got it done," he said, "I like the flat so much that my wife said it was big enough to be ready to have two children." Liu's parents started doing business in his hometown in the early 1990s, and Pan's family is in good financial condition.
两人结婚后就定居在武汉，2013年全款买下了汉口的那套商品房。
After marriage, the two settled in Wuhan, and in 2013 they bought the whole set of Hankou commercial housing.
我问刘辉，汉口那套房子怎么处置？刘辉说准备卖掉了，买新房借了不少钱，需要用第一套房子的卖房款还账。
I asked Liu Hui what to do with the apartment in Hankou. Liu said he was going to sell it and borrowed a lot of money to buy a new house.
他又拜托我帮他发发广告，如果身边有想在汉口买房的朋友可以联系他。
He also asked me to help him to send advertising, if there are people who want to buy a house in Hankou friends can contact him.
之后的一段时间，我们便各忙各的事，没怎么再聊起房子了。
For some time afterwards, we were busy with our own business, and talked little of the house.
我也在朋友圈里帮他发了广告，期间有联系我问房子情况的人，我都转给了刘辉。
I also helped him in the circle of friends advertising, during the period of contact I asked people about the house, I transferred to Liu Hui.
但那套房子刘辉却一直都没出手，偶尔聊起，只说自己在忙着装修新买的房子。
But that set of house Liu Hui has never sold, occasionally chatted, only to say that he was busy decorating the newly bought house.
刘辉在汉口的那套房子的确很抢手，无论房型、位置还是面积都十分符合市场需求。
Liu Hui in Hankou set of houses is indeed very hot, no matter the type, location or area are very in line with market demand.
刘辉说他们8月份就把房子挂上了房产中介的网站，马上就有人联系他们约看房时间了。
Mr. Liu said they posted the house on the estate agency's Web site in August, and they were contacted immediately to make an appointment.
9月份，有位之前通过我联系过刘辉的朋友抱怨说：“这两口子太不地道了。
In September, a friend who had contacted Liu Hui through me complained: "This couple is not authentic.
”我问原因，他就说之前谈好170万，各方面都准备好了，交定金那天刘辉却突然反悔了，说不卖了。
"I asked the reason, and he said that 1.7 million had been negotiated before, that all was ready, and that Liu Hui had suddenly reneged on the deposit and said he would not sell it.
这种临时“放鸽子”的行径令他十分生气，还顺带着埋怨起我，让我以后别再给他介绍这种“不靠谱的家伙”了。
This makeshift "pigeon-dove" made him angry and complained of me and told me not to introduce him to this "ridiculous guy" in the future.
我转头打电话问刘辉怎么回事。
I turned to ask Liu Hui what was the matter.
刘辉却无奈地说，交定金前“放鸽子”是潘文的意思——来看房的人很多，潘文感觉肯定是之前的价格要低了，非说等到军运会之后看行情再卖。
Liu Hui helplessly said that before paying the deposit, "put pigeons" is the meaning of Pan wen - come to see a lot of people, Panwen must feel that the previous price is lower, only to wait until after the Games to see the market before selling.
我也有点不开心，说如果这样的话就不帮你们发广告了，不然弄得我也不好做人。
I am also a bit unhappy, said that if so do not help you to advertise, otherwise I would not be good.
刘辉叹了口气，没再说别的。
Liu Hui sighed and said nothing more.
转眼就到了年底，一次吃饭时，大家又聊起房子的事情。
In a twinkling, towards the end of the year, at a dinner table, we talked again about the house.
潘文就立刻感慨说，这年头投资什么都不如投资房子，现在汉口那套房的挂牌价已经涨到200万了，他们当初买时只花了100来万，价值几乎翻了一番。
Mr. Pan immediately lamented that 'investment is not nearly as good as investing in a house these days,' Mr. Pang says. 'The price of the Hankou suite has risen to 2 million.
我有意揶揄了她一句，笑着说：“这样的话，你干脆别卖了，看这架势，以后还得涨，留个十年八年，估计能涨到上千万，可别便宜了别人。
I said with a laugh, "Well, don't sell it at all. You'll have to go up in ten years and eight years. Don't take advantage of somebody else.
”潘文大概没听懂我话里的嘲讽，竟点点头表示同意。
Pan, who probably didn't understand my sarcasm, nodded in agreement.
刘辉就转过头来，抱歉地冲我笑笑，说：“还是卖了吧，新房那边借了太多钱，压力太大。
Liu Hui turned around and smiled at me apologetically. "Sell it," he said. "I borrowed too much money from the new house.
”又补充说，他已经通过房产中介找到了买主，对方来看过几次房子，准备下定金了。
He added that he had found a buyer through a real estate agent, who had visited the house several times and was ready to make a deposit.
潘文脸上就有些不快，白了刘辉一眼，说自己听闺蜜们讲，年后武汉房价肯定还有一轮上涨，现在买房子的人都是来“捡漏”的，卖房子的人都是“苕”（方言：傻瓜）。
Pan Wen on the face of a little unhappy, a white Liu Hui, said they listened to the girls, Wuhan after the year will certainly have a round of house prices, now buyers are to "leak," the house sellers are "Tiaoxiao."
之后又举出几个同事和朋友买房的例子，正说得带劲，刘辉却突然粗暴地打断了她——刘辉声音很大，也吓了我一跳。
Then I gave the example of several colleagues and friends to buy a house. Just then, Liu Hui suddenly interrupted her rudely. Liu Hui's voice was very loud and frightened me.
我诧异地看着他，刘辉却只是摆摆手，说不要聊房子的事情了。
I looked at him in surprise, but Liu Hui just waved his hand and said not to talk about the house.
之后，刘辉就全程黑着脸，无论和他聊什么，都只是哼哼哈哈地应付过去。
After that, Liu Hui blushed all the way, no matter what he talked with, just hum and haw to deal with the past.
1月17日，春节前最后一次见刘辉。
I saw Liu Hui for the last time before the Spring Festival on January 17.
那天他来光谷看家具，中午约我一起吃饭。
He came to Guang Gu to see the furniture that day and invited me to dinner at noon.
话题又到了房子上面。
The conversation went back to the house.
刘辉说，汉口的房子卖掉了，200万多一点，对方前几天已经交了定金。
Liu said Hankou's house had been sold, a little more than 2 million, the other side had paid the deposit a few days ago.
我赶忙向他表示祝贺，问他这笔钱打算如何“潇洒”一下。
I hastened to congratulate him and asked him how the money was intended to be "smart."
他就说，还完二套房借款剩下的部分，准备买点好家具，毕竟买完这套房子，10年内不打算再换了。
After all, he said, he was going to buy some good furniture by paying back the rest of the loan from his second home. After all, he would not change the house in 10 years.
刘辉又让我代他向之前那位被潘文“放鸽子”的朋友致歉，我便打着哈哈说，这种事也不能全怪潘文，毕竟两次价格相差30几万，不是一个小数目，彼此之间都可以理解。
Liu Hui also asked me to apologize to the friend who was Pan Wen "Footing the Pigeon", and I said that Pan could not be blamed for such a thing. After all, the difference between the two prices is more than 300,000, not a small amount, each can understand each other.
那天刘辉情绪很好，跟我聊了很多关于房子的事情，临分别时还约我春节收假后去参观他的新家。
That day Liu Hui was in a good mood. He told me a lot about the house and asked me to visit his new home after the Spring Festival holiday.
我开玩笑问他，乔迁新居还要不要我随份子？刘辉哈哈笑着说不用，到时他就在家炒几个菜，我们一起喝两杯。
I jokingly asked him if he wanted me to move into his new apartment or not? Liu Hui laughed and said no. Then he would cook a few dishes at home and we would have two drinks.
1月23日，武汉封城。
Wuhan Sealed on January 23.
当时我已经返回老家过年，听到消息后赶紧给刘辉打电话询问情况。
I had already returned to my hometown for the New Year. I called Liu Hui immediately after hearing the news.
他们一家人还住在汉口的老房子里，距离新闻上说的“新冠病毒”发源地华南海鲜市场不远。
The family lives in an old Hankou house near the seafood market in southern China, where the news says the New Crown Virus originated.
刘辉说家人身体还好，请我放心。
Liu Hui said the family is fine, please rest assured.
大家聊了几句疫情的事，便挂了电话。
Everyone chatted about the outbreak and hung up the phone.
1月29日正月初五，我刷微信时，突然发现刘辉和潘文都在朋友圈发出了卖房广告——就是汉口那套老房子——我当时有些诧异，刘辉不是说已经和别人签了合同吗？发信息问他房子的事情，他没有回。
January 29, January 5, I brush micro-letter, I suddenly found Liu Hui and Pan Wen in the circle of friends issued sales ads - Hankou set of old house - I was surprised that Liu Hui has not signed a contract with other people?
等到2月4日中午，我才接到刘辉电话，一上来就问我之前那个联系他买房的朋友还要不要了。
By noon on February 4, I received a phone call from Liu Hui. I asked the friend who had contacted him to buy a house before whether he wanted to.
我说，人家之前被你放了鸽子，现在我怎么好意思再去问？刘辉沉默了一会儿，拜托我一定再帮忙去问问，他就按照之前170万的价格卖房。
I said that you had let the pigeon, now how can I ask again? Liu Hui was silent for a while, please I must help to ask, he sold the house according to the previous price of 1.7 million.
我很吃惊，问他什么情况。
Startled, I asked him what had happened.
刘辉说，之前那个合同黄了，他现在急需把房子卖掉拿钱出来，不然年后就麻烦了……我这才知道，原来他们买第二套房时实在借不到钱，他便将父亲在老家的工厂厂房抵押给了贷款公司，拿到140万，这才付了第二套房的首付。
Liu said the previous contract was yellow and he needed to sell his house to pay for it, or he would be in trouble three years from now... I found out that he had mortgaged his father's factory building in his hometown to a loan company for 1.4 million, thus paying the down payment on the second flat.
他本来打算把汉口的房子卖掉之后，立刻把钱还给贷款公司赎回厂房，没想到临到还款关头“出事了”。
He had intended to sell Hankou's house, immediately redeem the money to the loan company plant, did not expect the repayment juncture "something happened."
我十分不解，印象中刘辉父母的工厂价值远不止140万。
I am very puzzled, the impression that the factory value of Liu Hui's parents is far more than 1.4 million.
刘辉便解释说，贷款公司的业务经理是潘文的中学同学，当时建议他们将厂房低价抵押，这样一来可以把贷款利息谈得低一些，二来放款速度快，手续办完当天就能出款。
Mr. Liu explained that the loan company's sales manager, a classmate of Pan Wen's high school, had advised them to mortgage their plants cheaply, so that they could negotiate lower interest rates on the loans and lend quickly so that they could pay the money the same day they finished.
刘辉父亲这些年也用过类似办法筹措资金，出于对同学的信任，刘辉夫妇便同意了。
Liu Hui's father used similar methods to raise funds over the years. Out of his trust in his classmates, Mr. and Mrs. Liu agreed.
他们原本打算通过“时间差”，以最小的成本解决二套房的首付资金，但现在汉口那套房子却出了问题。
They had intended to settle the down payment for the second suite at minimal cost through a "time difference," but there was a problem with the Hankou unit.
军运会前，有七八位买家找他们夫妇看过房，但两人一直没有下决心卖。
Before the Games, seven or eight buyers looked for the couple, but they had not made up their minds to sell.
潘文觉得所有的消息都说军运会后房价要暴涨，来看房的人越多，她越不想卖，觉得那些人都是想捡“军运会前”这个漏。
Pan felt that all the news was that house prices would soar after the war. The more people came to see the house, the less she wanted to sell it.
刘辉也曾提醒过妻子，厂房的抵押合同只签了半年，2月中旬就要还款了，二手房交易也需要时间，但潘文还是想再等等，非说那套房子不愁卖，能多赚点就多赚点，“谁也不嫌钱咬手”。
Liu Hui also reminded his wife that the mortgage contract for the factory building was only signed for half a year, that repayment was due in mid-February and that second-hand housing transactions would take time.
刘辉没法再坚持，毕竟父亲厂子那边正在谈一笔生意，年前就有定金要到账，初八还有一笔预付款，这两笔钱加起来也应该足够赎回厂房的。
Liu Hui can no longer insist, after all, father is talking about the factory side of a business, years ago there is a deposit to the account, the eighth day of a deposit, these two sums of money should also be enough to redeem the plant.
因此，直到2020年1月上旬跟我吃饭之前，他们才把卖房的事情敲定。
So it wasn't until they dined with me in early January 2020 that they finalized the sale.
买家姓赵，也在那套房子附近住，想给从外地来武汉养老的父母买套房子。
The buyer, Zhao, also lives near the apartment and wants to buy a house for his parents who have come to Wuhan from other places to retire.
老赵春节前去刘辉家看过4次，最后一次是11号——那天老赵直接带了装修公司“看现场”，第二天便和刘辉签了购房合同，付了17万定金。
Lao Zhao Spring Festival to see the home four times, the last time is 11 - that day old Zhao directly with the decoration company "see the scene," the next day and Liu Hui signed a contract to buy a house, paid a deposit of 170,000.
之后的一周，因为刘辉被单位派去外地出差，双方便约好20号一起去办手续。
The following week, because Liu Hui was sent to the unit on a business trip, the two sides made an appointment to go through the formalities together on the 20th.
可20号一早，刘辉接到老赵的电话，说家里出了点情况，购房手续的事情得“往后延几天”。
Mk. 20 the early morning, Liu Hui received a call from Lao Zhao, saying that something had happened at home, the purchase procedures had to "delay a few days."
再过几天就要过年了，刘辉有些着急，可老赵那边说，父母都病倒了，自己也感觉身体不太舒服，正忙着带一家人去看病，暂时没有功夫去搞房子的事情。
A few days later, Liu Hui was worried, but Lao Zhao said that his parents were ill and that he was not feeling well. He was busy taking his family to the doctor and had no time to do anything about the house.
听老赵这么说，刘辉也不好再坚持。
Hearing Lao Zhao say so, Liu Hui is not good to insist.
“后来他家确诊了3例肺炎，现在我也不知道那天没跟他去办手续到底是福还是祸……”刘辉说。
"His family later confirmed three cases of pneumonia, and I don't know if it was a blessing or a curse not to go through the formalities with him that day..." Liu said.
“老赵只是说往后延几天，没说不买，你现在找新买家合适吗？”我问刘辉。
"Lao Zhao just said a few days later, did not say do not buy, you now find a new buyer?" I asked Liu Hui.
刘辉赶紧解释说，之前的合同已经作废了。
Liu explained quickly that the previous contract had been cancelled.
两天之前，老赵的妻子联系潘文，要求解除购房合同，自己家中有3人感染了，老赵父母已被送往医院救治，老赵本人则被隔离观察，买房的事情要往后拖一下。
Two days ago, Lao Zhao's wife contacted Pan Wen to ask for the cancellation of the house purchase contract, his own family three people infected, old Zhao's parents have been sent to the hospital for treatment, Lao Zhao himself was quarantined observation, the purchase of a house to be delayed.
电话里，老赵妻子一再向潘文夫妇道歉，说自己不是有意爽约，真的是家里出了事，她还向刘辉夫妇提出了“退房”诉求。
On the phone, Lao Zhao's wife repeatedly apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Pan, saying that she did not mean to break the appointment, but something really happened at home.
即便不退，也希望刘辉夫妇念在她家现在这种情况，能够延长付款时间。
Even if do not retreat, also hoped Liu Hui couple reads in her home now this condition, can extend the payment time.
为了让刘辉夫妇相信她说的话，老赵妻子把定点医院给老赵父母以及老赵本人开具的诊断书和CT照片都发给了潘文。
In order to convince Mr. and Mrs. Liu Hui of what she said, Lao Zhao's wife gave Pan a medical certificate and CT pictures from the Ding-point Hospital to Lao Zhao's parents and himself.
刘辉两口子一下就懵了。
Mr. and Mrs. Liu had no experience at all.
“合同虽然没有注明买房因重大疾病有权解除合同，但却有一条叫‘不可抗力’，他们说现在疫情就是‘不可抗力’，希望我能体谅一下他们家现在的情况……”刘辉说。
"Although the contract does not state that the buyer is entitled to rescind the contract due to a serious illness, there is one called force majeure and they say the outbreak is force majeure and I hope I can understand what is happening to their family..." Liu said.
他原本还不知道这是不是真的属于“不可抗力因素”，咨询了房产中介，中介那边也拿不定主意，建议他们先跟老赵妻子协商，万一协商不成的话，再通过诉讼方式解决。
He did not know whether this is really a "force majeure factor," consulting the estate agency, the intermediary is also uncertain, advised them to negotiate with the old Zhao wife, in the event of failure to negotiate, then through litigation.
刘辉和潘文商量再三，实在不想因为此事跟老赵一家对簿公堂，一来买房卖房对双方本是一件皆大欢喜的事情，他们也不想把喜事办成愁事；二来在这关口上还逼迫人家，确实有些不近情理；三来即便为此打了官司，等判决结果下来也早就耽误了贷款公司那边的还款时间，有这功夫，还不如想想其他办法。
Liu Hui and Pan Wenwen discussed repeatedly, really do not want to go to court with the old Zhao family, on the one hand to buy a house is a happy thing, on the other hand, they do not want to worry about the happy things;
刘辉和老赵妻子随即解除了购房合同，退还了定金，再打电话联系房产中介，想打听一下还有没有其他买家时，房产中介却说，“这关口，大家都想着保命要紧，哪个还有心思考虑房子的事情？”可刘辉却不能不考虑房子的事情。
Liu Hui and his wife immediately cancelled the purchase contract, returned the deposit, and then called the real estate intermediary, to find out if there are other buyers, the intermediary said, "This pass, we are all concerned about life, who has thought about the house?" But Liu Hui can not consider the house.
他赶忙让潘文打电话给当初帮忙贷款的中学同学，问他贷款公司那边能不能给自己做一下延期，毕竟现在疫情这么严重，连银行都放出消息可以延迟归还购房贷款，希望贷款公司那边也能够照顾一下自己的情况。
He hastened to ask Pan to call his high school classmates who had helped with the loan and ask him if the loan company could postpone the loan. After all, the situation is so serious that even the bank can delay the repayment of the loan, hoping that the loan company can also take care of their own situation.
不久之后，同学回复他们说，公司拒绝了贷款的延期申请，理由是合同中没有标明疫情“属于延期还款的不可抗力因素”，银行延期是银行的事情，他们的贷款不能延期，届时不还只能算“逾期”。
Some time later, the students replied that the company had rejected the extension of the loan on the grounds that the contract did not indicate that the outbreak was "a force majeure factor for deferred payments," and that the bank extension was a matter for the banks, whose loans could not be extended and would not be considered "overdue" at that time.
我只能劝刘辉不要着急。
I can only advise Liu Hui not to worry.
眼下即便抵押贷款“逾期”，对方顶多上涨一部分贷款利率作为“罚息”。
For now, even if the mortgage is "overdue," the other party may at most raise a portion of the loan rate as a "penalty interest rate."
按照之前他们签订贷款合同时约定的利率，这部分“罚息”数额也不会太大，就当自己损失一点房价算了。
According to the rate they agreed to when they signed the loan contract, this part of the "penalty interest" amount will not be too large, as their own loss of a little calculated.
但刘辉却更着急了，说当时自己着急借钱，根本没想着自己真的会逾期，只关注了贷款利率却没有仔细看“逾期责任”，现在转过头来再看合同，才发现“逾期罚息”这块竟然高得离谱——“每天2‰的罚息，按照140万贷款算，光是罚息一天就要交2800，这谁能承受得起！”而且，即便交了高额罚息，过后3个月还不上全款，对方还是要收走厂房。
However, Liu said he was anxious to borrow money, did not think he would really overdue, only pay attention to the loan interest rate but not carefully look at the "overdue liability", and now turned to the contract, found that the "overdue penalty interest rate of 2% per day, according to 1.4 million loans, pay 2800 per day!
同学也给潘文“露了底”，他说贷款公司出借的这笔钱不是公司的钱，而是从其他地方拆借过来的，公司只是从中赚个差价。
The student also "exposed" Pan Wen, he said that the loan company loan money is not the company's money, but from other places, the company only earned a difference.
真正的金主不肯展期，贷款公司也没有办法。
The real money owner would not roll over, and the loan company had no choice.
他之前通过贷款公司跟金主协调过，金主得知情况后，坚持“还不上贷款的话就收厂房”。
He had previously coordinated with the money owners through the loan company, the owner of the situation, insisted that "loans will not be received before the plant."
“我现在才知道，那家贷款公司不怎么正规，很多东西都跟正常贷款机构不一样，都怪我当时急赶着借钱，为了把利息谈得低一些，答应了一些很苛刻的条件，但当时谁想着会遇到这种情况！”刘辉越说越生气。
"I just now know that the loan company is not formal, a lot of things are different from normal lending institutions, I was anxious to borrow money, in order to lower the interest rate, promised some very harsh conditions, but who thought this would happen!
“预付款呢？之前不是说春节前后会有一笔预付款到账，可以用来顶一下吗？”我接着问刘辉。
"How about the prepayment? I didn't say there would be an advance to the account before or after the Spring Festival. May I use it?" I asked Liu Hui.
一声长长的叹息就从电话那头传来。
A long sigh came from the other end of the telephone.
刘辉说，眼下整个湖北都处于封闭状态，孝感也紧随武汉封了城，工厂也早已停了工，不知什么时候才能复工。
Liu said that the entire Hubei is now in a closed state, filial piety also followed Wuhan closed the city, the factory has also stopped work, do not know when to resume work.
就算之后工厂开了工，还不晓得工人们能不能按时回来，真正恢复生产，还不知到了什么时候。
Even after the factory opened, it was not known whether the workers would be able to return on time and actually resume production.
他父亲跟合作方好话说尽，希望对方能够看在受疫情影响的份上宽限一些时日——这不仅是预付款的问题，去年年底，为了拿下这笔订单，厂子更新了设备，采购了原料，花销也不是小数目，如果取消订单，厂子着实难以承担这笔经济损失。
His father spoke up to his partners, hoping that the other side would see some time off for the sake of the epidemic - not just the upfront payment, for which the factory had renewed its equipment, purchased raw materials, and spent no small sum at the end of last year.
但合作方那边也有苦衷，坚决不肯等，给了刘辉父亲两个选择：要么取消合同，退还之前的定金，以后有机会再合作；要么合作方按照合同约定支付预付金，双方继续合作，但如果厂子后期不能按期交货，则要按照合同约定赔偿合作方损失。
However, the two parties also have grievances, resolutely refused to wait, Liu Hui father has two options: cancel the contract, return the deposit before the opportunity to re-cooperate, or the partner in accordance with the contract to pay the advance payment, the two sides continue to cooperate, but if the late delivery of the factory, will be contractually agreed to compensate the loss.
“现在这情景怎么开工？谁敢来开工？延误交货是肯定的，继续履行合同的话，之后怕是不但赚不到钱，反而要赔给合作方一大笔钱……”刘辉说，他父亲甚至为此找了当地县政府帮忙，县政府也派人跟合作方做了协调，但无奈对方死活不肯松口，最终双方只好一拍两散。
"Now how to start the scene? Who dare to start? The delay in delivery is certain, if the contract is continued, then not only not to earn money, but also to pay the partner a large sum of money.
抵押贷款无法延期，预付款的希望灰飞烟灭，刘辉夫妇只好再从汉口那套房子身上下功夫。
Mortgage loans can not be extended, the hopes of advance payments extinguish, Mr. and Mrs. Liu Hui have to work from Hankou set of house.
两人又联系了一些之前来看过房子的客户，但大家纷纷表示“情况有变”。
The two men contacted clients who had been to the house before, but there was plenty of talk of a change.
说话委婉一些的，告诉潘文目前武汉封城，相关部门都没上班，等“疫情过去了再说”；说话直白些的，直接告诉潘文，那套房子位于武汉爆发“新冠肺炎”的核心地带，他“不敢买”。
Euphemistically speaking, Pan Wen was told that the relevant departments were not at work until "the epidemic was over"; more bluntly, he told Pan that the house, located in the heart of Wuhan's "New Crown Pneumonia," was "afraid to buy it."
情急之下，刘辉甚至跟对方开出了“全款购买降价15万”的条件，但对方依旧不同意。
Under the circumstances, Liu Hui and the other party even issued a "full purchase price of 150,000" conditions, but the other side still disagreed.
倒是有了解情况的房产中介工作人员私下联系刘辉，提出可以用挂牌价70%的价格帮忙“内部消化”一下，如果他同意，马上可以拿钱，只需在线签个协议，手续等到疫情过去之后再办。
But a real-estate agent with knowledge of the situation privately contacted Mr. Liu and offered to help 'digest' the situation for 70% of the price tag. If he agreed, he could get the money immediately, just sign an agreement online and wait until the epidemic is over.
刘辉觉得对方明显是在“趁火打劫”，便没有答应。
Liu Hui felt that the other party is obviously "taking advantage of the looting," then did not agree.
“现在又有消息说，之后武汉的房价很可能要大跌，现在买太不划算，所以大家又开始观望了……”最后，刘辉又叹了口气。
"Now there is news that prices in Wuhan are likely to plummet after that. Now it is not cost-effective to buy them, so people are starting to wait and see..." Finally Liu sighed.
挂了电话，我急忙联系之前那位找我咨询买房的朋友，把刘辉家的情况跟他简要说了，又把“原价170万就卖”的话转达了，但那位朋友说，目前自己回不了武汉，也没有心思再考虑买房的事情，即便要买，也要等到疫情过去之后再说。
Hang up the phone, I hastened to contact my friend who asked me to buy a house, to brief him about the situation of the Liu Huei family, and to convey the "original price of 1.7 million to sell," but the friend said that he could not go back to Wuhan, and was not in the mood to buy, even after the epidemic passed.
我只好把情况反馈给了刘辉。
I had to give the information back to Liu Hui.
尾声2月14日中午，刘辉给我打电话，说要借钱。
Last Feb 14th At noon Liu Hui phoned me to say he wanted to borrow some money.
我问他要多少，他说看在朋友一场的份上，能给凑多少就给他凑多少吧，他实在是没有办法了。
I asked him how much he wanted, and he said that for the sake of his friends, he could just scrape together as much as he could.
我翻遍身上所有银行卡，能够借给他的也只有不到7万块，又向朋友开口，勉强给他凑够了10万。
I turned over all my bank cards and was able to lend him less than 70,000, then asked my friend to give him enough for a hundred thousand.
虽然距他的需要还差十万八千里，但这也是我能提供的最大帮助了。
It's eight thousand miles short of what he needs, but that's the best I can do.
我问刘辉下一步怎么办，刘辉的情绪很低落，他说现在手头借了大概四五十万，其余的还在想办法。
I asked Liu Hui what to do next. Liu Hui was in a low mood. He said he now had about four and a half million dollars on hand, and the rest were still trying to figure out what to do.
他又拜托我帮他查了一下抵押贷款逾期之后的责任问题，方便的话帮他找个律师，看能否在“疫情”上面找找出路，毕竟老家那套厂房价值至少在两三百万左右，是父母大半辈子的心血，以后还指望工厂养老呢，真要140万被别人拿走，他真的无法接受。
He asked me to check on his liabilities after the mortgage expires, and help him find a lawyer if it was convenient to find a way out of the "epidemic," which is worth at least two or three million dollars, and which parents have spent most of their lives looking forward to retirement in factories.
“实在不行，也只能让之前那个房产中介‘内部消化’了，至于损失，就当是这几年白干了吧”。
"Really can not, also can let that estate intermediary 'internalize', as for the loss, think that the last few years have been wasted."
电话里，刘辉又对妻子之前一直等“军运会后房价大涨”而不赶紧卖房筹钱的做法颇有抱怨，我劝他别怪潘文了，她那样做也是为了多赚点钱，谁也想不到突然遇到大事，现在你俩还是先想办法筹钱，其他事情以后再说吧。
I would advise him not to blame Pan for doing so in order to make more money. No one should think of any sudden event. Now you two should try to raise money first, and we can talk about other things later.
