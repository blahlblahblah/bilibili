“说实在的，我那段时间最大的奢望什么都不是，是能找个地方让我停下来，睡那么一会儿，我就满足了！”驾驶室里的肖红兵。
"To tell you the truth, my greatest ambition of those days was to find a place where I could stop and sleep for a while, and I was content!" said Xiao Hong in the cab.
视频截图文 |新京报记者 魏芙蓉编辑｜陈晓舒校对| 刘越►本文约3737字，阅读全文约需7分钟2月8日，农历元宵节的上午，50岁的货运司机肖红兵终于走出了那辆鄂M牌的轻型卡车，结束了他的高速“流浪”。
Liuyue: About 3737 words, it takes about seven minutes to read the full text. On the morning of the Lantern Festival on February 8, Xiao Hongbing, 50, the freight driver, finally got out of the E-M pick-up truck, ending his high-speed vagrancy.
他拥有了一间可以落脚的房间。
He had a room where he could stay.
经汉中交警与汉中北服务区协调，服务区为他免费提供一个小屋子，仅仅是床、空调和热水器这些基础陈设已经让肖红兵格外满足，“20天了，我终于可以洗个热水澡了”。
In coordination with the Hanzhong North Service District, the service area provided him with a small room free of charge. The basic furnishings of beds, air-conditioners and water heaters satisfied Xiao Hong Bing.
受新冠肺炎疫情影响，1月23日起，全国多处高速入口实行交通管制，肖红兵的货运行程和回乡计划被打乱了。
Due to the outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia, traffic control was imposed on many high-speed entrances to the country on January 23, disrupting Xiao Hong Bing's cargo itinerary and plans to return home.
高速路口难下，乡镇道路难行，1月26日后，肖红兵和他惹眼的鄂M牌货车被迫在高速路上开始漫无目的的行驶。
After January 26, Xiao Hongbing and his eye-catching E-M truck were forced to drive aimlessly along the highway.
过去近20天里，肖红兵的床就是轻型卡车的后排座椅。
For nearly 20 days, Xiao Hongbing's bed was the back seat of a pick-up truck.
他在上面铺上垫子和被褥，车辆停在高速服务区，“对付着就睡过去了”。
He covered it with mattresses and bedding, parked his car in a high-speed service area, and "slept on it."
肖红兵和汉中交警交谈的视频中，他几乎涌出眼泪，“说实在的，我那段时间最大的奢望什么都不是，是能找个地方让我停下来，睡那么一会儿，我就满足了！”视频被传到网上之前，肖红兵身上只剩下百余块存款。
In the video of Xiao Hong Bing talking to Hanzhong traffic police, he almost burst into tears. "To tell you the truth, my greatest ambition of those days was nothing but to find a place where I could stop and sleep for a while and I was satisfied!
在这一天，他收到1万余元爱心捐款，作为日后回家的路费。
On that day, he received more than 10,000 yuan in love donations as a way to pay his way home.
肖红兵收到的网友爱心捐款被“耽误”的回乡路这辆4米长的轻型卡车，红色车头，车身被墨绿色防雨布包裹着，是肖红兵主要的谋生工具，他早年在江西做铝合金安装，“赚不着钱”，便花两万元买下这辆卡车。
Xiao Hong Bing received the "delay" of the netizen love donation was "delayed" by the homecoming road this 4-meter light truck, red car body wrapped in dark green rainproof cloth, is Xiao Hongbing's main livelihood tool.
跑短途挣钱不多，肖红兵尽量选择跑长途，路程最少都是五六百公里。
Run short-distance money is not much, Xiao Hongbing try to choose to run long distances, at least five or six hundred kilometers.
虽然辛苦一点，但跑长途的费用按路程计，每公里一块多到两块不等。
Although a little hard, the cost of running long distances varies from one kilometer to two.
他在专门的物流平台上接单，将货物送往目的地，卸货后就在当地等着接下一单继续出发。
He takes orders from a special logistics platform, delivers the goods to their destination, unloads them and waits locally for the next order to proceed.
1月7日，肖红兵从湖北荆州拉着一车汽车配件上路了。
January 7, Xiao Hongbing from Hubei Jingzhou pull a load of car parts on the road.
先后经过了浙江、贵州、福建等地。
Has passed through Zhejiang, Guizhou, Fujian and other places.
计划中的最后一站是福州，将福州的货物送抵之后，如果顺利，开上一天一夜的车，他就能回到位于湖北省天门市的家中。
The last stop was Fuzhou, where he could return to his home in Tianmen City, Hubei province, if he drove the night before and after the cargo arrived in Fuzhou.
“春节是全家团圆的时候，再远也要回去过个年”。
"The Spring Festival is the family reunion time, also must go back to have a New Year."
这是肖红兵家里的老规矩。
This is Xiao Hongbing's old rules.
肖红兵没想到，抵达福州之后，一车医用物资“挡”住了他的回家路。
Xiao Hongbing did not expect to arrive in Fuzhou, a load of medical supplies "block" his way home.
“在福州，导航都设定好了，准备回家了，但刚好有个客户说快到春节了找不到车，希望我帮帮忙，看能不能运一批货到四川”。
"In Fuzhou, the navigation is set, ready to go home, but just a customer said that the Spring Festival will not find a car, I hope I can help to see whether a shipment to Sichuan.
电话里，肖红兵得知要送的货物是一批医用口罩，对方显得非常着急。
On the phone, Xiao Hong Bing learned that the goods to be delivered is a batch of medical masks, the other side appears very anxious.
“当时我还不知道疫情暴发了，我看这么急就没想太多去拉了，告诉家里今年没法回去过年。
"At that time I did not know the outbreak of the outbreak, I do not think too much to pull, told the family this year can not go back to New Year.
”大量的时间耗费在驾驶上，肖红兵的信息是滞后的。
"A lot of time spent driving, Xiao Hong Bing's information is lagging.
手机被用来导航，他很少看新闻。
Mobile phones are used for navigation and he seldom watches the news.
一天行程下来，他往往身心俱疲，想着早点眯眼睡觉，更是无暇顾及日程之外的信息。
At the end of the day, he is often tired and wants to squint earlier than scheduled.
家人偶尔在手机上给他发来疫情通报的信息，也都没有引起肖红兵的重视。
Occasionally the family on the mobile phone sent him the information of the epidemic notice, also did not arouse Xiao Hongbing's attention.
大年三十那天，当他把货物运到四川达州时，才首次察觉到了异样。
On New Year's Eve, when he transported the goods to Sichuan state, he first noticed something strange.
高速口被隔离墩挡住，不让车辆出入。
The high-speed entrance was blocked off from traffic.
一些可以下去的地方，警察戴着口罩，穿着防护服。
Some places to go down, the police wearing masks, wearing protective clothing.
肖红兵从来没见过这么个阵仗，这让他感到不安。
Xiao Hong Bing has never seen such a battle, which makes him feel uneasy.
在四川达州的高速路口，趁着量体温的间隙，肖红兵跟工作人员聊天，这才知道疫情暴发的具体情况，而湖北是高发区。
At the highway junction in Sichuan state, Xiao Hongbing chatted with the staff while taking temperature measurements. Only then did he know the details of the outbreak. Hubei was a high-incidence area.
肖红兵的货车被检查和消毒。
Xiao Hongbing's van was checked and disinfected.
受访者供图鄂M牌车，把他卷入风波之中肖红兵还未察觉到，他湖北人的身份和那辆鄂M牌车，已经把他卷入风波之中。
The interviewee supplied the M-shaped Hubei vehicle, and caught him up in the storm. Xiao Hong Bing was not aware that his Hubei identity and the E-M had brought him into trouble.
大年初一的早上，他在达州平仓县卸货，不远处，有数十名当地人观望着，他们用方言小声议论，并朝着鄂M牌车的位置指指点点。
On the morning of New Year's Day, he unloaded goods in Pincang County, Minnesota. Not far away, dozens of locals watched, whispering in local dialect and pointing to the location of the E-M.
肖红兵不解，“我听不懂，完全不知道怎么回事。
Xiao Hongbing puzzled, "I do not understand, do not know how the matter.
我之前到很多地方都卸过货，从来没有人围观，也从没有碰到过这样的情况，我有点被吓到了”。
I've been to a lot of places before and I've never been around, and I've never been in a situation like this, and I'm a little scared. "
人群中有人报了警，不到半个小时警察就来了。
The police were called from the crowd and came in less than half an hour.
在警察例行询问时，肖红兵把所有的高速收费发票都拿了出来，按照时间顺序一张张衔接起来，以此证明自己1月7日离开荆州之后未曾涉足湖北。
During routine police questioning, Xiao Hongbing took out all the invoices for high-speed charging and followed them up in chronological order to prove that he had never set foot in Hubei Province since leaving Jingzhou on January 7.
离开湖北的时间长，也没有发热现象。
The time that leaves Hubei is long, also did not have feverish phenomenon.
警察建议他尽快离开达州。
The police advised him to leave the state as soon as possible.
警察走了，肖红兵以为这就证明自己没“问题”了。
The police left, Xiao Hong Bing thought this proved that there was no "problem".
在当地的铺子吃完饭准备离开之时，他的车又被堵住了，“当地人用小三轮车在我的车前后拦着。
As the local shop finished eating and preparing to leave, his car was blocked again. "The locals stopped me in the back and back of my car in a tricycle.
我想跟他们说明情况，他们告诉我，湖北的车不让停”。
I want to explain the situation to them, they told me that Hubei's car is not allowed to stop.
当地人告诉肖红兵，“赶快走。
The local people told Xiao Hong Bing, "Come on.
”肖红兵在手机上把导航打开，将终点设为湖北荆州，最短的路线显示813公里。
Xiao Hongbing opened the navigation on his mobile phone and set its destination in Jingzhou, Hubei Province, with the shortest route showing 813 kilometers.
他重新开上高速，按照往常习惯，他绝不会跑空车回去，“800多公里，油钱就得1000多块钱，过路费大概就是500块钱”。
He drove back up the freeway and, as usual, he would never run empty. "Over 800 kilometres, you'll get more than a thousand bucks for the gas and about 500 bucks for the journey."
他希望能在返乡的途中接上一趟货再走。
He hoped to pick up the goods on his way home.
一则陕西的订单解了燃眉之急，他准备先前往陕西拉这车大米。
A Shaanxi order to meet the urgent need, he is ready to go to Shaanxi to pull this cart of rice.
但途中，订单被取消了，因为他资料中登记的湖北信息。
On the way, however, the order was cancelled because of the Hubei information registered in his file.
肖红兵着急，在接下来的接单中，他会先打电话给物流公司询问，“我主动说我是湖北的车，想问问有没有影响”，但电话那头的人一听到是湖北的车，便都连说“不行不行”！工作人员在电话里劝肖红兵：现在大家对湖北的车和湖北的人都害怕，湖北的车别说能不能下高速，装货肯定也装不了。
Xiao Hongbing worried, in the next order, he would call the logistics company to ask, "I volunteered that I am Hubei's car, to ask if there is any impact," but the people at the other end of the line said "No way!
手里只揣着2000块钱，肖红兵不敢在外面多作停留，“没办法，我接受现实准备空车跑回去了”。
Holding only 2000 yuan, Xiao Hongbing dare not stay outside more, "no way, I accept the reality of running back empty car."
找不到终点的行程，只能往前开但返乡的路也没有想象中容易。
Can not find the end of the journey, can only drive forward but the way home is not easy to imagine.
肖红兵不敢告诉家里70多岁的老父母这一路的处境。
Xiao Hongbing didn't dare to tell his parents in their seventies about their situation.
他和老婆打电话商量，才得知，天门的村庄、小区已经全部实行封闭管理，所有的机动车一律不许上路，连电动车都不让骑。
He and his wife to discuss by telephone, just learned that the Tianmen village, small area has been completely closed management, all motor vehicles are banned from the road, even electric cars are not allowed to ride.
外来车辆一律不许滞留。
No foreign vehicles are allowed to stay.
肖红兵给老家的110打电话咨询。
Xiao Hongbing called 110 in his hometown for advice.
“他们说如果在外地安全的话也尽量不要回来了，本地医疗资源非常紧张，要避免给政府、医院增加压力。
"They said they would try not to return if they were safe in the field, that local medical resources were very tight and that pressure on the government and hospitals needed to be avoided.
他们建议我跟我所在的地方110联系，暂时找个地方安置下来，等疫情结束了以后再回来”。
They advised me to contact my place 110 and find a place to settle down temporarily until the outbreak is over.
肖红兵这才意识到：家也回不去了。
Xiao Hong Bing only then realizes: Home also cannot go back.
异地的乡镇不允许外地人外地车停留，湖北车尤甚。
Townships in other cities and towns do not allow outbound vehicles to stay, especially Hubei vehicles.
高速公路上的检疫点，工作人员也特地告知肖红兵：湖北的车“敏感”，为了安全考虑，不建议下高速。
Highway quarantine point, staff also specifically told Xiao Hongbing: Hubei car "sensitive," for security reasons, do not recommend the next high-speed.
达州通向荆州的高速公路上，肖红兵发现，越来越多的高速服务区不让停了，“我只能一直开，停不下来”。
On the highway leading to Jingzhou, Xiao Hongbing found that more and more high-speed service areas were not allowed to stop.
“以前导航，有个终点我还知道怎么走，但是这一次导航我不知道选哪个终点，我不知道应该往哪走”。
"Navigation before, there is an end I also know how to go, but this time navigation I do not know which destination to choose, I do not know where to go.
摆在他眼前的是一条没有终点的路。
He had before him a road that had no end.
肖红兵和站在货车前打电话。
Xiao Hongbing and standing in front of the van on the phone.
图片来自汉中发布 官方微信服务区不让停车，意味着肖红兵在高速上失去了踏实睡觉的可能。
Photo taken from Hanzhong issued the official micromail service area to stop, meaning Xiao Hong Bing lost the possibility of sleeping on the highway.
他曾经尝试下高速停在一条乡间小道上想短暂休息，但是还没一会儿就有居民过来说，“赶快走湖北车，要不报警了”。
He once tried to take a short break on a country lane, but before long residents came in and said, "Take the Hubei bus or call the police."
困得快睡着的时候，他掐大腿，揪头发。
When he was fast asleep, he pinched his thighs and pulled his hair.
因为疲劳驾驶，有好几次甚至差点撞到护栏上面。
I almost hit the guardrail several times because of fatigue driving.
“我当时在想，这怎么办？我真的以为过不去了”。
"I was thinking, what about this? I really thought I couldn't make it."
1月26日以后，在高速公路上两天两夜的行程里，肖红兵睡了两次，一次不到两小时，一次40分钟，都是只能停在服务区以外的高速紧急停车带上。
On the two-day and two-night trip on the expressway after January 26, Xiao Hong Bing slept for less than two hours at a time for 40 minutes at a time.
两次浅眠最终都被交警叫醒。
Two shallow sleep were eventually awakened by the traffic police.
占用紧急停车带，按照交通法，需要对肖红兵扣6分罚款200元。
Occupy emergency parking zone, according to traffic law, need to buckle Xiao Hong Bing 6 points fine 200 yuan.
但了解他的情况后，交警没有处罚，“他们看到我也太累了，说这次是特殊情况，让我开走”。
But knowing his condition, the traffic police did not punish, "They see me too tired, said this is a special case, let me drive away."
肖红兵只能再接着往前开。
Xiao Hong Bing can only go on and on.
“希望湖北车重新上路时，大家能正常对待和接受”肖红兵计算过，自离开四川达州后，失去目的地的那段路途里，油费和过路费花费了4000多元。
"I hope you will be able to take the road again," Xiao said. "Xiao Hongbing has calculated that he spent more than 4,000 yuan on fuel and tolls on the way to his destination since he left Sichuan.
困意难抵，他向高速路工作人员求助时，对方告知他一些集中安置湖北人的宾馆，肖红兵犹豫了，“如果要住下就不是一天两天的事，这样下去不知道要花多少钱。
When he turned to the highway staff for help, the other side told him that some of the central location of Hubei people hotel, Xiao Hongbing hesitated, "if we have to live in a day, so do not know how much it will cost.
”往常跑长途他也很少住宾馆，一般都是在高速服务区睡上几个小时接着再跑。
He seldom stayed at a hotel for the long haul, usually sleeping for hours in a high-speed service area before running.
“只要找个地方不赶我走，有吃的，我在车上睡也没关系，能坚持下来，只是没想到都不能停”。
"As long as there is no place to drive me to go, there is food, I sleep in the car is also okay, can insist on, just did not think can not stop."
在高速路上行驶的时候，与他同行的车辆也不多，肖红兵在停车的间隙留心过，“平均每二十分钟会有一辆车经过”。
While driving on the highway, he was not accompanied by many vehicles, Xiao Hongbing in the parking space to pay attention to, "on average every 20 minutes a car will pass by.
他遇到过一次“同行”，在肖红兵打盹时敲开车窗，二人在各自的车厢里倾吐一路上的经历，并交换了行程。
He met a "colleague", in Xiao Hongbing doze while knocking on the window, the two in their cars pour out the experience along the way, and exchange itineraries.
肖红兵的行程没有变化。
Xiao Hongbing's itinerary did not change.
他的导航目的地还是湖北荆州，尽管知道无法成功抵达了，但他只希望尽量靠湖北近一点，他模模糊糊地开，能走的地方就走，不能走的地方就绕，“走到后面我都不知道是个什么方向了”。
His navigational destination was Jingzhou, Hubei, and although he knew he could not make it, he only wanted to be as close as possible to Hubei, and, vaguely, he left where he could go, circling where he could not go.
1月29日，肖红兵行驶到了陕西汉中的高速口，看到有标语写着“疫情防控禁止通行”，他就找了一块宽敞点的地方，把车停了，睡了。
On January 29, Xiao Hongbing drove to the highway in Hanzhong, Shaanxi Province, and saw a sign saying "No Passage to epidemic prevention and control." He found a spacious place to park his car and fall asleep.
直到被陕西交警叫醒时，他已睡了近3小时，是多日来睡得最长的一次。
By the time he was woken up by the Shaanxi traffic police, he had slept nearly three hours, the longest in many days.
交警没有催促他离开，他们把肖红兵带离了紧急停车带。
Traffic police did not urge him to leave, they took Xiao Hongbing away from the emergency parking belt.
在汉中北高速服务区，交警跟服务区负责人沟通后，肖红兵的车终于可以在这里停下来。
In Hanzhong North high-speed service area, traffic police and service area responsible for communication, Xiao Hongbing's car can finally stop here.
在只有泡面的驾驶室里，肖红兵想念米饭的味道。
In the cockpit with only foam noodles, Xiao Hongbing missed the taste of rice.
初到汉中北服务区的几天，他将自己的鄂牌卡车停稳，首先去超市买了几盒自热米饭，16元一盒，吃完嘿嘿笑，量不够，这才发觉有点小贵。
First, he went to the supermarket to buy a few boxes of self-heating rice, 16 yuan a box, after eating Hei Hey laugh, the amount is not enough, then found a little expensive.
汉中交警送给肖红兵的水和食物。
Hanzhong traffic police gave Xiao Hongbing water and food.
图片来自汉中发布 官方微信此后十天，他还是睡在车上。
Ten days after the official letter was released, Hanzhong slept in the car.
但服务区工作人员每天会为他量体温，帮他给车消毒。
But the service area staff takes his temperature every day and disinfects his car.
陕西当地有一种巴掌大的面饼，服务区主管过来都会顺手捎上几个。
Shaanxi Province has a palm-sized bread, the head of the service area will come to pick up a few.
交警队的负责人还带来了方便面和牛奶。
The head of the traffic police also brought instant noodles and milk.
开春时节的陕西汉中，晚上气温降到零下一摄氏度左右，肖红兵启动发动机，让热风填满驾驶室。
In the spring of Shaanxi Hanzhong, the night temperature fell to minus one degree Celsius, Xiao Hongbing started the engine, let the hot wind fill the cab.
但很多时候，“热风”也是奢侈的，吹上一会他便关掉，“怕耗油”。
But most of the time, "hot wind" is also a luxury, blowing a while he turned off, "afraid of oil consumption."
2月8日元宵节，一则视频拍到肖红兵和交警的交谈状态，他几乎涌出眼泪，“说实在的，我那段时间最大的奢望什么都不是，是能找个地方让我停下来，睡那么一会儿，我就满足了！”视频被传上网络前，肖红兵身上只剩下百余块存款。
Feb. 8, Lantern Festival, a video shot of Xiao Hong Bing and traffic police conversation state, he almost welled up tears, "To tell you the truth, my greatest extravagance of those days was nothing but a place to stop me and sleep for a while, and I was satisfied!
在这一天，他收到1万余元爱心捐款，作为日后返家的路费。
On that day, he received over 10,000 yuan in love donations as a way to pay his way home.
更大的惊喜是，汉中北服务区的工作人员还为他安排了房间，免费。
Even more pleasantly, the staff of the Hanzhong North Service Area arranged rooms for him free of charge.
仅仅是床、空调和热水器这些基础陈设已经让肖红兵格外满足。
Only the bed, air conditioning and water heater these basic furnishings have let Xiao Hong Bing be particularly satisfied.
“我是以拉货为生的，等到疫情过去，全国解封了，湖北的恢复估计还会滞后很多。
"I am to pull goods for a living, when the epidemic has passed, the whole country unsealed, Hubei recovery is expected to lag a lot.
我就希望我们湖北的车重新上路时，大家能正常对待和接受。
I just hope that our Hubei when the car back on the road, we can be normal treatment and acceptance.
”这是肖红兵现在唯一的心愿。
"This is Xiao Hong Bing's only wish now.
