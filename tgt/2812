撤档、卖版权、免费播出，一通操作下来，欢喜传媒和字节跳动博得了路人的好感，同时也在行业内部遭到了抵制。
To remove files, sell copyright, free broadcast, a direct operation down, happy media and byte beat won the favour of passers-by, but also within the industry was boycotted.
其中折射的，不只是普通观众对于影视行业的不了解，也有传统影业与互联网由来已久的相爱相杀。
Among them refraction, not only the general audience for the film and television industry do not know, but also the traditional film industry and the Internet long-standing love killing.
文|史千蕙编辑 |金匝运营 |肖睿1对于普通观影者王凝来说，2020年的春节档，是“反转再反转又反转”。
AT & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45
1月23日上午，他通过购票软件购买了《囧妈》和《姜子牙》的预售电影票。
On the morning of January 23, he bought tickets for the presale movies of "Jommy" and "Ginger's Teeth" through ticketing software.
10小时后，距离春节档正式开始不到20小时，原定于春节上映的7部影片，由于新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情的扩大，纷纷宣布撤档。
Ten hours later, less than 20 hours before the start of the Lunar New Year, the seven films scheduled for release on the Chinese New Year have been pulled back due to the spread of the new coronavirus pneumonia.
王凝，以及和他一起贡献了今年春节预售票房4.02亿元的无数观影者，失去了大年初一去影院的机会。
Wang Ning, and with him contributed to the Spring Festival advance ticket room 402 million yuan countless viewers, lost the opportunity to go to the cinema on the first day of the New Year.
第二天，1月24日，电影《囧妈》官微和导演徐峥的微博宣布，《囧妈》将通过抖音、西瓜视频等短视频平台免费播放。
The next day, Jan. 24, the film "Jung Ma" and director Xu Zheng's micro-blog announced that "Jung Ma" will be broadcast free of charge on short video platforms such as chatter and watermelon videos.
又有新电影看了，而且还不要钱——通过新浪娱乐随后发起的一场投票来看，这个前无古人的举动，显然受到了普通观影者的欢迎。
There were new movies to watch, and there was no money - an unprecedented move that, judging by a subsequent poll by Sina Entertainment, was clearly welcomed by ordinary viewers.
在那场70余万人参与的投票里，45.8万人投给了“前无古人，徐峥牛逼！”这个选项。
Of the more than 700,000 people who voted, 458,000 voted for "Zheng He, Xu Zheng!".
王凝也投了这一票。
Mr. Wang also cast his vote.
1月25日，大年初一。
January 25, New Year's Day.
吃完午饭后，他叫上父母，坐在电视机前，观看由手机投屏到电视上的《囧妈》。
After lunch, he called his parents, sat in front of the TV and watched "Damn Mom" on TV from his cell phone screen.
影片开始15分钟后，第三次反转来了——一家三口都发现，少了影院里的气氛，端坐在自家明亮的客厅里，“看电影”这项活动变得有些难以投入。
Fifteen minutes after the film began, the film came back for the third time - a family of three found it hard to get involved in the movie without the atmosphere of the theater and sitting in their bright living room.
在发觉彼此都不是很想继续后，他们一个接一个去睡午觉了。
After discovering that neither of them wanted to continue, they went to bed one by one.
对一部电影的态度可以在几天内转变三次，王凝并不是唯一一个人。
Wang isn't the only one whose attitude to a movie can change three times in a matter of days.
在播出两周后，《囧妈》的豆瓣评分最终落在了5.9分，低于近八成的喜剧片。
Two weeks after the show, "Jomo"'s Doubles score fell to 5.9 points, down from nearly 80% of comedies.
在徐峥导演的全部作品里，《囧妈》仅比垫底的《港囧》高0.2分——这还是在免费观影的操作已经赢得了一部分观众缘的前提下。
Of all of Xu Zheng's works, "Jung Ma" is only 0.2 points higher than "Hong Kong Jung," which comes in at the bottom - despite the fact that the free-to-watch operation has already won some audience.
一条获得了6300个点赞的短评非常不客气地说：“有点理解为啥首映卖竖屏视媒了……真的线下上映会被同期打得非常惨痛。
"It's a bit of an understatement to understand why the premiere of the TV channel... and the actual offline release is going to be pretty poignant over the same period," said a highly unkind remark.
”对于普通观影者而言，126分钟的电影和几十块钱的电影票原本也不是大事。
For ordinary viewers, 126 minutes of movies and dozens of dollars in movie tickets would never have been a big deal.
但在电影之外，《囧妈》掀起了更大的风波。
But outside of the movie, "Jomo" has caused more turmoil.
陈雁是从事了多年影视发行的业内人士，有比普通观众更敏锐的行业嗅觉，尽管她和其他人一样，是刷新闻时看到这条消息的。
Chen Yanan, a veteran film-and-television insider, has a sharper sense of industry than the average viewer, though she, like everyone else, saw the news while brushing the news.
陈雁详细地列举了自己看到消息之后的内心戏——第一反应是，“太聪明了”：由于无法如期上映，先前横店影视对于《囧妈》的保底，“肯定歇菜”，但找了字节跳动，天价售出版权，因此从商业角度来说，不会亏，又因为打了免费的牌子，民间口碑一定大获全胜。
Chen detailed his inner play after seeing the news - his first reaction was "too clever": previous Hengdian films and television coverage of "Jung Ma" were "definitely off the table," but the byte beat and sky-high prices sold the copyright, so from a commercial point of view, thanks to the free brand, folk word-of-mouth is sure to win.
然后她开始感叹字节跳动和欢喜传媒签下的6.3亿元的协议，“太舍得砸品牌了，这大手笔，比抖音那20个亿的红包影响力要强得多。
Then she began to lament the byte jump and the $630 million deal signed by the Happy Media, "Too bad to break the brand," which was far more influential than the 2 billion-dollar red envelope.
”再转念一想，“影院肯定炸锅了。
"On second thought," The theater must be fried.
”陈雁的判断是准确的。
Chen Yan's judgment was accurate.
1月24日晚上，横店影视所在的浙江电影行业协会发布了一则声明，在声明中，《囧妈》片方的决定被定义为“一种破坏行业基本规则的行为”。
On the night of January 24, the Zhejiang Film Industry Association, where Hengdian Film and Television is based, issued a statement in which it described the decision as "a violation of the industry's basic rules."
几乎与此同时，同为春节档的《唐人街探案3》主控方的万达电影总裁曾茂军通过媒体表态：“院线电影就要上院线，除非是网络大电影。
At about the same time, Zeng Maojun, president of Wanda Motion Picture, which is also the party in charge of the Chinese New Year's Eve Detective 3, said through the media: "The movie is going to the upper house, unless it's a big movie online.
”▲浙江电影行业协会发布的声明节选。
Excerpt from a statement issued by the Zhejiang Film Industry Association.
图/ 网络2一部院线电影从杀青到上映，原本是需要三方共同努力：制片方负责拍好电影，发行方负责把影片卖给影院，而院线则负责提供设备和进行放映。
/ [^ # 39 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105] / n. A film from a cinema to its release originally required a three-way effort: The producers made the film, the distributor sold it to cinemas, and the studio provided the equipment and the screenings.
根据《国家电影事业发展专项资金征收使用管理办法》的规定，在缴纳税费后，票房的57%-59%属于院线方，40%-42%属于制片方，1%-3%属于发行方。
According to the Measures on the Administration of Collection and Use of the Special Fund for the Development of State Cinematography, 57 to 59 percent of the box office after paying taxes and fees belong to the movie studios, 40 percent to 42 percent to the producers, and 1 percent to 3 percent to the issuing party.
这意味着，通常而言，一部不亏本的院线电影，经济上最大的受益方是院线。
This means that, as a rule, the biggest economic beneficiary of a blockbuster movie is the theater.
而《囧妈》的操作，直接架空了院线的这部分收入。
And the operation of "Jung Ma" directly empties this part of the income of the courtyard line.
一位影城的排片经理在自己的知乎回答中，用类比解释了影院同行们的愤怒：“全国电影行业，无论影院还是宣发方，和徐峥团队打天下的时候，对着泰山起誓，共分天下。
"Analogously, one film-maker, in his response, explained the fury of his cinema counterparts by analogy:" The national film industry, whether it be cinemas or promoters, and the Xu Zheng team, sware to Mount Tai and share the whole world.
我给你兵马、粮草、武器，帮你打下来了，现在分天下了，你说没我的事，跟一个空降的什么力都没出的分了。
I gave you soldiers, horses, grass, weapons, to help you down, now divided into the world, you said that I have nothing to do with a parachute of any force.
你说，这是不是背信弃义？”院线方面对于《囧妈》的不满不止于此。
Are you saying that this is perfidious? "The Senate's displeasure with" Damn "does not stop there.
1月20日下午，《囧妈》片方在官方微博上宣布，提档至大年三十上映。
On the afternoon of Jan. 20, "Jung Ma" Fang announced on the official microblog that the file will be released on New Year's Eve.
“快过年了，大家都想提前见妈妈，满足你！”这条微博下方的评论风向，和四天后刷屏的“免费播放”官宣相比，形成了鲜明的反差。
"It's almost New Year's Eve, and everyone wants to see Mom ahead of time to satisfy you!" The comments below the microblog stand in stark contrast to the four-day-old "free-air" publicity campaign that swept the screen four days later.
最高赞的评论几乎都是由影城的工作人员发出的：“大年三十不能回家见自己妈，被迫留在电影院上班看别人的妈？”吉祥是北京中心一家影城的总经理，“很多片子之前也有过提档的操作，是为了出一轮口碑，但这部片子不应该这样提档。
Most of the best reviews were made by film workers: "You can't go home to see your mother in New Year's Eve and be forced to stay at the cinema to see other people's moms?" auspicious is the general manager of a movie center in Beijing.
大概一个月前，大家就知道大年初一统一上。
About a month ago, we all know the unification of New Year's Day.
观众也都买了初一的票，等着那天来看。
The audience also bought the first day of junior high school tickets, waiting to see that day.
《囧妈》在北京等一线城市做过路演，院线对于影片本身的质量有把控，排片什么的都安排好了。
"Jung Ma" in Beijing and other first-tier cities have done road shows, the quality of the film itself, the layout of all arranged.
而且按照以往的经验，大年三十下午四五点，就会提前让员工放假回家，照顾一下大家的感情。
And according to the past experience, about four or five pm, will let the staff holiday home in advance, take care of everyone's feelings.
这样一来，很多影院手足无措，排也不是，不排也不是。
As a result, many cinemas are overwhelmed, platoon is not, do not row is not.
”赵阳在院线已经待了14年了，现在，他是华东地区一家影城的总经理。
Zhao, who has been in the cinema for 14 years, is now managing director of a film city in eastern China.
在他看来，导致员工们临时加班、无法回家吃年夜饭，只是片方突然提档造成的后果中，最轻微的一个。
In his view, the result of temporary overtime, unable to go home to eat Chinese New Year's Eve dinner, is only the side of the sudden increase in the consequences, the slightest one.
“问题的核心不在于加班，如果有生意做，谁不愿意做？但这（提档）是破坏游戏规则的行为。
"The crux of the matter is not overtime, and if there's business, who won't do it? But that's a game-breaker.
”2020年的春节档早在疫情爆发前，就已经显现出与往年的不同。
The Spring Festival holiday in 2020 is already showing signs of being different from previous years, well before the outbreak.
1月15日，距离大年初一还有十天，春节档的预售仍然没有开始。
January 15, 10 days before the New Year's Day, the Spring Festival gear is still not the pre-sale.
相比下来，往年春节档预售的时间开得更早，所有影片同时开启宣传，市场有充分的预热时间，观众对电影的热情也会更高。
In contrast, the Spring Festival sales in previous years opened earlier, all the film simultaneously open publicity, the market has sufficient pre-warming time, viewers will be more enthusiastic about the film.
而在今年，根据赵阳的回忆，“不允许预售，一等再等，一拖再拖。
And this year, according to Zhao Yang's recollection, "not allowed to pre-sell, waiting again, procrastination.
最后规定提前7天（预售），这个时间已经非常紧张了。
Finally seven days in advance (pre-sale), this time has been very tight.
”春节期间，观众们的消费心态和普通节假日不同。
Audiences spend differently during the Spring Festival than on ordinary holidays.
抱着“大过年的”心态，大部分消费者不会计较比平常更高一些的电影票价。
With a New Year mentality, most consumers won't mind higher-than-usual movie prices.
“春节档对于整个票房的影响，大家看见的是总数的影响，就是那7天可能要占到整个全国的所有票房的9%左右，实际上要看整个春节档期，按一个月的时间来算，它应该能占到全国的票房的20%多。
"The impact of the Spring Festival holiday season on the overall box office will be seen in terms of total ticket sales, which may account for about 9 percent of all box office sales throughout the country.
”赵阳说。
"said Zhao Yang.
▲数据显示，近3年来，春节档期的电影票房大幅增长，成为整个电影市场的重要档期。
Data show that in the past three years, the Spring Festival holiday film box office has increased significantly, the film market as an important filmmaker.
图/ 艾媒咨询2019吉祥所在的影城，原本给了《囧妈》15%的排片占比，预计的票房在15-20亿元。
Chart / Media Advisory 2019 lucky located in the film city, originally gave "Jung Ma" 15% of the layout, the estimated box office of 1.5-2 billion yuan.
在看片结束后，他们对票房的预估降低了。
At the end of the show, their box office estimates dropped.
按照他的判断，如果春节档如期上映，《囧妈》和《姜子牙》的票房应该差不多，排在《唐人街探案3》和《夺冠》之后。
According to his judgment, if Spring Festival is released as scheduled, "Jung Ma" and "Ginger Tooth--" would have the same box office, after" Chinatown Detective 3 "and" Winning.
而根据猫眼专业版的统计，截至1月20日，《囧妈》的预售票房为2521.66万元，排在《唐3》和《姜子牙》之后，成绩最好的《唐3》，预售票房为15455.34万，是《囧妈》的6倍多。
As of Jan. 20, according to the cat-and-eye section, "Jung Ma" had 25,216,600 yuan in advance tickets, ranking behind "Tang 3" and "Ginger's Teeth." The best-performing "Tang 3," with 15,45,534 reserved rooms, is more than six times more than "Damn."
提前档期，争取多一天的票房，是当时的《囧妈》能够打出的既危险又有效的一张牌。
Advance booking, for an extra day at the box office, was one of the dangerous and effective cards that "Jung Ma" could play at the time.
然而人算不如天算，一场疫情把一切的节奏都打乱了。
However, the number of people is not as good as the day, an outbreak of all the rhythm has been disrupted.
吉祥一直关注着新闻，从1月20号起，疫情形势变得严峻，他想到了可能会有这种情况。
auspicious has been following the news, from January 20 onwards, the situation has become serious, he thought that this may be the case.
因此，23日，7部影片依次撤档后，他没有感到太大的意外。
So, on the 23rd, after the seven films were taken out of gear, he didn't feel too surprised.
他只能根据往年的数据来推断损失：从大年三十到年初六，单个影城的收入损失大概在200万元左右。
He can only infer the loss from the previous year's data: from about 30 years to 6 years, the loss of income of a single film city is about 2 million yuan.
赵阳认为，疫情造成的连锁反应，在某种程度上“救”了《囧妈》。
Zhao Yang thinks, the chain reaction that epidemic causes, to a certain extent "saved" "embarrassed mother."
“从操作上，我完全理解，这是不得以而为之，并不是说有多聪明。
"Operationally, I fully understand that this must not be done, not how smart.
要是没有这次疫情，以电影本身的质量，一定会被打得极惨。
Had it not been for the outbreak, the quality of the film itself would have been disastrous.
”撤档、卖版权、免费播出，一通操作下来，欢喜传媒和字节跳动博得了路人的好感，同时也在行业内部遭到了抵制。
"Shifting files, selling copyrights and broadcasting free of charge, a one-way operation down, happy media and byte beat won the favour of passers-by, but also met with resistance within the industry.
其中折射的，不只是普通观众对于影视行业的不了解，也有传统影业与互联网由来已久的相爱相杀。
Among them refraction, not only the general audience for the film and television industry do not know, but also the traditional film industry and the Internet long-standing love killing.
3《囧妈》引发的关于院线电影上线短视频平台的争端，是其中最特殊的例子——它的缘起是一场无人料到的疫情。
3 One of the most extraordinary examples of the controversy over short-video platforms on-line in movie theaters sparked by "Jomo" - has its origins in an unexpected epidemic.
而在此之前，院线电影的“票补”之战和新媒体版权之争，也经历了长期的拉扯。
And before that, the movie "ticket repair" war and the new media version of the power struggle, also experienced a long-term pull.
从2014年暑期档到2018年春节档，由互联网引发的持续了近四年的“票补”，曾在一段时间里改写了票房历史。
The nearly four-year Internet-induced "ticketing" period from the summer of 2014 to the Spring Festival holiday of 2018 has rewritten box office history for some time.
数据显示，2010年前后，一张电影票的均价为42.9元，电影前台的售票价格则在60-120元之间。
Around 2010, the average price of a movie ticket was 42.9 yuan, while the price of a ticket at the front desk was between 60 and 120 yuan.
那是一个看电影还不算大众消费的年代。
It was a time when movies were not yet consumed by the masses.
《阿凡达》上映时，新民网曾经就其高达三位数的票价做过一次民调，69%的参与者表示，“抢钱啊，这么贵的票，有病才会看。
When Avatar was released, Xinmin had conducted a poll on its three-figure ticket price. Sixty-nine per cent of the participants said, "Steal money.
”但根据陈雁的回忆，3D效果带给观众们前所未有的冲击，还是“恨不得要下跪”。
But according to Chen's recollection, 3D effects have brought audiences an unprecedented shock, or "would like to kneel."
当年吉祥还在上大学，是电影爱好者。
At that time lucky Xiang was still attending university, is a movie lover.
几乎每周他都会去电影院看电影，一张电影票对学生来说，是一笔不小的钱。
Almost every week he goes to the cinema to see a movie. A movie ticket is a lot of money for a student.
“那时候北京多厅影城还不多，得抓紧买票、抢好座位，黄牛和倒票的也很多。
"There were not many movie halls in Beijing at that time, so we had to hurry to buy tickets, grab good seats, scalpers and tickets.
能通过影院的关系，买到好票、好座位、便宜票，在当时是很牛的。
Can be through the relationship between the cinema, buy good tickets, good seats, cheap tickets, at that time is very bully.
”2014年夏天，《变形金刚4》上映，线上售票平台首次对电影票价进行大规模补贴。
In the summer of 2014, when Transformers 4 opened, online ticket platforms heavily subsidised ticket prices for the first time.
上映第一周，猫眼电影出票额达450万——贡献了30%以上的票房。
In the first week, the Cat Eye movie produced 4.5 million tickets - more than 30% of the box office.
而对于观众们来说，只要九块九，就能坐在影院里看3D大片，甜头甚至超过了今日《囧妈》的免费播放。
And for viewers, for nine dollars or nine, they can sit in a theater and watch 3D blockbusters, surpassing even the free airing of Today's Mommy.
看似双赢的“票补”，造就了国内票房市场的狂欢。
Seemingly win-win "ticket repair", the domestic box office market created a carnival.
2015年，中国电影票房较前一年增幅高达45%，全年440亿元票房，电商补票规模达到40亿元。
In 2015, China's box office grew 45 percent over the previous year, grossing 44 billion yuan at the box office and 4 billion yuan for TV commercials.
2016年，全年票房达到457.12亿元，而电商补票的规模则缩减到15亿元。
In 2016, the year-round box office reached $45,712 million, while the number of complimentary tickets decreased to $1.5 billion.
又过了一年，票补烧钱的主力，从网络购票平台转向了片方：在2017年，全年票补超过20亿元，其中片方投入的票补达12亿元。
A year later, the main money-burning ticket repair platform from the network to the side: in 2017, more than 2 billion yuan in the full year, of which Fang put in 1.2 billion yuan of additional votes.
观众们在9.9元、19.9元的低价优惠里，养成了去影院看电影的习惯，可是自掏腰包进行票补的片方却苦不堪言。
Audiences got into the habit of going to the movies with a low price of 9.9 yuan and 19.9 yuan, but those who paid for it out of their own pocket suffered terribly.
没有票补，就意味着没有排片，没有票房。
There is no ticket stuffing, it means there is no platoon, no box office.
华谊兄弟CEO王中磊在2018年的电影投资高峰论坛上表示，票补是一笔不必要的巨大开支，但“如果你不掏，我就告诉你友商那里补了多少钱，你不补的话，电影院不给你排场”。
Wang Zhonglei, CEO of Huayi Brothers, told the 2018 Film Investment Summit Forum that the compensation was a huge and unnecessary expense, but "if you don't pay, I'll tell you how much money your friend made up, and if you don't, the theater won't show you up."
几乎与此同时，互联网电影公司也引发了电影版权价格的疯涨。
Almost at the same time, Internet film companies have caused the price of film copyright to skyrocket.
2010年，《让子弹飞》的独家网络版权价格为500万，四年后，同为姜文导演的作品《一步之遥》的独家网络版权价格飙到了3000万。
In 2010, the exclusive Internet copyright in Let the Bullets fly was 5 million, and four years later, the price of the exclusive Internet copyright for Jiang Wen's "One Step Away" hit 30 million.
犹如军备竞赛般的疯狂补贴在2018年停止了。
Like an arms race, the frenzied subsidies came to an end in 2018.
那一年的春节档，“限票补”规定出台，谁都买不到低于19.9元的电影票了。
In that year's Spring Festival holiday, the "limited ticket supplement" regulations, no one can buy less than 19.9 yuan of film tickets.
对于制片方而言，好处几乎是立竿见影的。
For the producers, the benefits are almost immediate.
2018年中国电影票房达600亿元，创造了票房的新纪录，这其中，制作成本不超过6000万元的《我不是药神》和《无名之辈》，一共贡献了39亿元的票房。
In 2018, China's film box office hit 60 billion yuan, setting a new record at the box office, including "I'm Not a Pharmacist" and "Anonymous," which cost no more than $60 million, contributing 3.9 billion yuan to the box office.
小成本、小制作的电影作品，终于迎来了它们的春天。
Small cost, small production of film works, finally ushered in their spring.
从2014年到现在，观众们从9.9元电影票的惊喜，到重新适应几十块钱的电影票，再到学习在线上付费观看正版，也经历了类似“反转再反转又反转”的心路历程。
From 2014 to the present, viewers have gone through a similar process, from the thrill of 9. 9 yuan movie tickets to the re-adaptation of dozens of movie tickets to learning to pay for a live version on-line.
在观众们终于习惯为正版内容买单时，《囧妈》上线短视频平台，不免让人推测，院线电影线上线下的同时播映，是否会成为新的趋势？一场疫情，可能改变一个行业吗？4几乎所有的业内受访对象都表达了他们对此的不乐观。
As viewers finally get used to paying for legitimate content, the online short-video platform for "Jock Mom" leads one to speculate whether the simultaneous offline and offline distribution of movies is a new trend? Is an epidemic likely to transform an industry? 4 Almost all industry respondents expressed their frustration.
陈雁认为，不同的窗口期造成的效应是叠加的，大制作的电影先上院线，下映后再上线网络平台，是公认的利益最大化的操作方式。
Chen Yan believes that the effect of different window period is superimposed, large-scale film first on the upper court line, then on the online network platform after the film is recognized as the maximum benefit of the operation.
“人为减少窗口期，直接网播，并不能创造更大的价值。
"Artificially reducing windows and webcasting directly does not create greater value.
”陈雁对电影有情怀，就像大部分影视行业从业者一样。
Chen Yan has a passion for films, just like most film and television industry practitioners.
“电影一百年了。
"A hundred years ago.
电视发展起来的时候，电影死了吗？它没死。
Was the movie dead when the TV came along? It wasn't dead.
DVD发展起来的时候，电影死了吗？它也没死。
Was the movie dead when the DVD developed? It wasn't dead either.
视频网站发展也不是一两年了，电影还没死。
Video site development is not a year or two, the film is not dead.
”赵阳甚至对于此次欢喜传媒和字节跳动携手能够造成的品牌效应都保持怀疑。
Zhao is even sceptical about the brand effect that happy media and byte jumping can have together.
长视频领域里，腾讯、优酷和爱奇艺三家已经争夺已久、烧钱已久，字节跳动砸下6个亿买的广告，是否能造成异军突起？“第一，有没有获得那么多流量？第二，流量那完了之后，有没有存留？要改变市场的格局，没有想象中简单。
Will Tencent, Youku and Aikido, the three long-running contenders, burn money for six hundred million dollars worth of ads, cause an explosion in the long-running video landscape? "First, is there that much traffic? Second, is there a hangover after that?
”从技术角度说，家庭影院的质量再怎么追赶，也赶不上影院：“就算你家电视有120寸，你也没有7.1声道；就算你家电视有240寸，你也没有IMAX。
Technically, you can't catch up with a movie theater: "Even if your TV is 120 inches, you don't have 7.1 channels; even if your TV is 240 inches, you don't have IMAX.
”线下观影独有的属性，仍然无法被互联网线上播放替代。
Features unique to offline viewing are still unable to be replaced by on-line playback.
“现代人走进电影院的目的，不单纯是为了看故事，而是为了要跟别人一起看故事。
"Modern people go into cinemas not just to see stories, but to read them with others.
”赵阳说。
"said Zhao Yang.
在每个受访者的描述中，线上观影都是电影与琐碎生活的一场战斗：看一会，拿起手机玩一玩；再看一会，暂停一下出去上厕所。
In each interviewee's description, the online view was a battle between the movie and the mundane: watch for a while, pick up the phone and play with it; watch for a while, then pause and go to the bathroom.
没有沉浸式的观影场景，没有黑暗之中的专心致志，作为观众本身，能够获得的观影体验也会打折。
There is no immersion scene, no concentration in the dark, as the audience itself, can get a discount for the viewing experience.
▲走进电影院观影，仍然是一种很难被取代的娱乐方式。
Walking into the cinema is still a difficult way to replace the entertainment.

1月中旬，她参加了看片会，看电影的时候，她觉得拍得挺好的，情绪也饱满，甚至还哭了好几次，尽管她也觉得“有特别明确的逻辑上不是特别合理的地方”。
In mid-January, when she went to the movies, she thought she was doing well, feeling full, and crying even several times, although she thought "there was a particularly clear logic that wasn't particularly reasonable."
她总结，是电影院这个场景，放大了观众们的观影体验。
It was the cinema, she concluded, that magnified the viewer's experience.
“咱们中国人，比较含蓄，在电影院的时候，可以肆无忌惮地去流泪，你说你在家看，在客厅哭，边上的人看你，你会不好意思，你的情绪就会被压抑，然后你的感受就不会那么好。
When you say you are at home, you cry in the living room, when people on the edge look at you, you will be embarrassed, your emotions will be suppressed, and then you won't feel so good.
”技术进步后，电影行业本身已经发生了不少变化。
The film industry itself has changed a lot as a result of technological progress.
赵阳举了Netflix的例子，尽管作为出品方，互联网公司Netflix有着“网飞出品，必属精品”的美誉，但这家诞生于1997年的公司，依然无法脱离其起家时的本质：一家在线影片租赁提供商。
Zhao cited Netflix as an example of a company that, although Netflix, as a maker of Netflix, has a reputation for "flying out of the web, it must be a boutique," the 1997-born company is still stuck with what it was when it started: an online film rental provider.
创立三年后，Netflix开发出一套推荐算法，可以根据用户的浏览记录，推荐他们“可能感兴趣的内容”。
Three years after its creation, Netflix has developed a set of recommended algorithms that can recommend "what might be of interest" to users based on their browsing history.
这套如今看来无比眼熟、并被几乎所有短视频平台沿用和完善的看法，才是Netflix扩张的最大武器。
This now-familiar, almost all short-video platforms are the biggest weapon in Netflix's expansion.
这种以数据为基础驱动的模式，被很多人认为彻底颠覆了传统的电影内容制作。
This data-driven model is seen by many as a radical reversal of traditional film production.
派拉蒙和福克斯的前CEO、IAC和Expedia集团现董事长甚至在节目中公开表示，“好莱坞现在已经无关紧要了。
Paramount and Fox's former CEO, the current chairman of the IAC and Expedia groups, went so far as to say publicly on the show, "Hollywood is irrelevant now.
”赵阳不同意这个看法。
Zhao disagreed.
小成本电影《罗马》，在去年的奥斯卡颁奖中拿到了最佳导演、最佳外语片和最佳摄影三项大奖，而Netflix作为出品方，并没有让《罗马》在院线大规模上映，而只是在早先为了冲击奥斯卡而进行了为期三周的小规模点映。
The low-cost movie "Rome" won three awards last year for best director, best foreign language film and best picture, while Netflix, as the producer, did not allow "Rome" to hit theaters on a large scale, but earlier in a three-week mini-screening to hit the Oscars.
赵阳分析，归根结底是因为如果大规模上院线，投资和收益不成正比，转而上线网络、推出付费会员制观看，则好处更多。
Zhao Yang analysis, the bottom line is because if large-scale upper house line, investment and income is not proportional, instead of on-line network, the introduction of pay-per-member watching, the benefits are more.
《囧妈》之后，同期撤档的电影尚未做出上线视频网站的表态。
"Jomma" after the same period of the withdrawal of the film has not made online video site position.
情人节档期将至，而疫情依然严峻，大多数线下影城依然处在停业状态，《乔乔的异想世界》《小妇人》等奥斯卡引进片也逐一撤档。
As Valentine's Day approaches, the epidemic remains acute, with most of the offline studios still out of business, and Oscar introductions such as Jojo's Wonderful World and Little Women are being pulled back one by one.
在赢得了路人口碑，也得罪了业内同行后，《囧妈》可能是这个正月里唯一的“赢家”了。
After winning over the road and offending peers in the industry, "Jung Ma" may be the only "winner" this month.
