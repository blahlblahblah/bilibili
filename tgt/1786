除夕那段时间主要是无序，工作量大、急迫，突然之间与病毒狭路相逢，刺刀见红，没有后援，只有拼命，那个时候是一片混沌状态。
The New Year's Eve period is mainly disorderly, workload, urgency, suddenly and narrow road with the virus, stabbing red, no back-up, only desperate, then is a chaotic state.
现在有所好转，形势每天都不一样，我每天处理的问题也不一样，还都是紧急的，但总的来说比以前有章法了。
Things are getting better now, things are different every day, I'm dealing with different issues every day, and they're all urgent, but on the whole more organized than before.
武汉市第一医院门诊大楼。

新京报记者 向凯 摄文 |新京报记者向凯编辑｜王婧祎校对|卢茜►本文约3398字，阅读全文约需6分钟武汉市第一医院位于硚口区，是一家综合性三甲医院。
Beijing News reporter to Kai's editor, Wang Jing: About 3398 words in this article. It takes about six minutes to read the full text. Wuhan City Hospital No. 1, located in the Zhoukou District, is a comprehensive triple-A hospital.
2月10日，该院接到武汉市防控指挥部指令，成为定点医院，需要提供1000张床位。
February 10, the hospital received Wuhan city control command order, a designated hospital, need to provide 1000 beds.
一夜之间，医院腾空外科大楼，转移原有病人，并对院区启动改造，短短两天后，就开始收治新冠肺炎确诊患者。
Overnight, the hospital vacated the surgical building, relocated its existing patients and initiated a renovation of the compound, which in just two days began treating patients diagnosed with pneumonia.
目前，武汉市第一医院提供床位1142张，实际收治病人数1089人，是武汉市定点医院中收治病人数最多的一家医院。
At present, Wuhan No. 1 Hospital provides 1,142 beds and has treated 1,089 patients, making it the largest hospital in Wuhan.
按照武汉市卫健委要求，一家定点医院的启用需要经过评估、征用、改造、验收、投入使用几个环节。
According to Wuhan Health Commission, the opening of a designated hospital needs to be evaluated, requisitioned, reconstructed, accepted and put into use several links.
2月5日，武汉市防控指挥部公布，定点医院原则上只收治确诊的重症病例和危重症病例，以及疑似的危重症病例。
On February 5, Wuhan city control command announced that the designated hospital in principle only admitted to the diagnosis of serious cases and critical cases, as well as suspected critical cases.
那么，武汉市第一医院是如何在短时间内完成改造，成为一家能够收治传染病人的定点医院，收治大量重症病人后，又是如何运作的？我们对话了武汉市第一医院副院长陈国华。
So how did Wuhan First Hospital complete its transformation in a short time and become a designated hospital for patients suffering from infectious diseases? We talked to Chen Guohua, vice-president of Wuhan First Hospital.
院区改造：“三区四通道”剥洋葱：改造的过程是怎样的？陈国华：我们2月10日接到武汉市防控指挥部的指令，成为定点医院，让我们准备1000张床位，并且要求两天后能立刻收治新冠肺炎确诊病人。
Chen Guohua: We received a directive from Wuhan Municipal Control and Prevention Command on Feb. 10, asking us to prepare 1,000 beds and treating patients diagnosed with pneumonia in two days' time.
我们本身是一家综合性医院，当初的建筑设计不是按照传染病医院来的，现在一下子要满足这么多床位需求，又要符合传染病管理、隔离的要求，压力很大。
We are a general hospital, the original architectural design was not based on infectious diseases hospital, now to meet the demand for so many beds, and to meet the requirements of infectious disease management, isolation, great pressure.
按照传染病医院相关规定，我们很快设计了方案，传染病医院要求“三区两通道”，“三区”就是清洁区、潜在污染区（缓冲区）和污染区，“两通道”就是医护人员通道和患者通道，我们在此基础上增加了污物通道和洁净物品通道，实际上是“三区四通道”，符合国家对传染病医院的要求。
In accordance with the relevant regulations of the Hospital for Infectious Diseases, we soon designed a scheme whereby hospitals for infectious diseases require "three zones, two passageways," which are clean areas, potential pollution areas (buffer zones) and contaminated areas.
我们医院有院感专家，他们会对改造把关，做完改造之后我们要跟市疾控专家电话汇报，毕竟是紧急情况，不能像平时先报图纸、审核、修改、施工、验收，不可能有这个过程，只能是电话上报。
Our hospital has a hospital sense experts, they will reform the gate, after the transformation we have to report to the city disease control experts by telephone, after all, is an emergency, can not report as usual drawings, review, modification, construction, acceptance, can not have this process, can only be reported by telephone.
同时我们也把方案报给市防控指挥部，他们马上派工程公司来实施改造，比如要增加隔断，形成相对独立的区域。
At the same time, we reported the plan to the Municipal Control Command, which immediately sent an engineering company to carry out the renovation, such as increasing the isolation to form a relatively independent area.
剥洋葱：除了“三区四通道”，改造过程中还有哪些考量？陈国华：我们考虑到有10支国家援助队要来，相当于大兵团作战，大兵团作战必须要有大通道，因此，我们把全部病房都放在外科大楼里，把医护人员通道的入口设置在门诊楼，门诊楼的二层和三层都有通道和外科大楼相连。
Chen Guohua: We take into account the fact that there are 10 state aid teams coming, which is the equivalent of a big regiment, and we have to have major passageways for big regiments, so we put all the wards in the surgical building and set up the entrance of the medical staff passage in the outpatient building.
我们规定，进入外科大楼的6-13层病房，要从门诊楼的二层通道进，进入14-20层病房，要从门诊楼的三层通道进，这种设计可以保证数量较多的医护人员的分流。
Access to the 6th-13th floor ward of the surgical building is regulated from the second floor of the outpatient building to the 14th-20th floor ward, which is accessible from the third floor of the outpatient building and is designed to ensure the diversion of a larger number of medical staff.
另外，我们要求病房单数楼层和双数楼层的交接班时间间隔一小时，单层上班时间是上午8点钟，双层是9点钟，这样保证错峰，避免人员拥挤。
In addition, we require a one-hour interval between the odd-numbered and even-numbered floors of the wards, with single-floor working hours at 8 a.m. and double-decker hours at 9 o'clock, so as to ensure staggered peaks and avoid congestion.
目前1640名外援，加我们本院400人左右，进出还是比较通畅，说明改造和设计应该是比较成功的。
At present 1640 foreign aid, plus our hospital about 400 people, access is still relatively smooth, showing that the transformation and design should be more successful.
在设计病区病房时，我们本来设计了详细的方案，每个病区都分开，但是按照我们的设计做下来至少得三到四天，鉴于要争分夺秒抢时间，病区的改造做了简化，也能理解，那个时候不可能有万全之策。
In designing the ward, we had devised a detailed plan, each separate, but it would have taken at least three to four days to do what we had designed. Given the time involved, the area was simplified and it was understandable that there would be no one-size-fits-all.
医务人员通道。
Medical access.
新京报记者 向凯 摄剥洋葱：医护人员进出改造后的病区，需要经过哪些流程？陈国华：医护人员进入污染区之前，首先要在清洁区更衣，脱下自己的外套，进入缓冲区，穿防护服，戴N95口罩。
Chen Guohua: Before entering the contaminated area, medical staff should first change clothes in the cleaning area, take off their jackets, enter the buffer zone, wear protective clothing and wear N95 masks.
我们的防护服是全遮蔽的，帽子有三层，手套有两层，鞋套有三层。
Our protective clothing is completely covered, the hat has three layers, gloves have two layers, shoe cover has three layers.
从污染区出来的人，要经过反复的消毒、洗手，脱防护服的过程中，一步一步，每做一个步骤就要洗一次手，整个过程大概要持续半个小时，我们算过，从污染区出来要达到12次洗手或者做手消毒。
In the process of repeatedly disinfecting, washing their hands and taking off their protective clothing, the hand is washed step by step and every step takes about half an hour. We calculated that washing hands or disinfecting the contaminated area should be done 12 times.
从清洁区到病房一共要经过5道门，每个区间24小时都有工作人员，负责通道的管理和物资的配备、发放，每个进入病区的医护人员都要先登记、领物资。
From the clean area to the ward, there are five doors, each 24-hour staff, responsible for the management of the passage, supplies, distribution, every medical staff into the area to register, receive supplies.
他们还会提醒医护人员如何规范的使用防护服，比如防护服脱的时候要从内往外卷，把污染部分卷到里边。
They will also remind health care workers how to use protective clothing on a regular basis, such as pulling it from the inside out and the contaminated parts inside when taken off.

新京报记者 向凯 摄医护人员进入潜在污染区之前，在缓冲区穿戴防护服、口罩、鞋套等。
Peking News reporters wear protective clothing, face masks and shoe covers in the buffer zone before photographing medical staff into potential contaminated areas.
新京报记者 向凯 摄病人管理：多方协作，分类管理剥洋葱：收治的病人如何管理？陈国华：新收治的所有病人都集中在外科大楼，外科大楼每一层相当于是一个大病区，比如8楼以前是妇产科一病区、妇产科二病区，现在就合并成一个大病区，交给一支医疗队接管，一般一层楼有约70张床位。
Chen Guohua: All newly admitted patients are concentrated in the surgical building, and each floor of the surgical building is equivalent to a major disease area. For example, the 8th floor, formerly a gynecology and obstetrics area and gynecology and obstetrics area, is now merged into a large area and handed over to a medical team, typically with about 70 beds on a floor.
我们从2月12日开始接收病人，把一个个病区装满。
We began receiving patients on February 12 and filled up the sick areas.
接下来，根据病人的情况进行分类管理，这就要靠医生一个一个去诊断，评估病情，再对病人的病区进行调整，比如先把危重症病人转到ICU去。
Next, according to the patient's condition classification management, this depends on the doctor to diagnose one by one, assess the disease, and then adjust the patient's area of illness, such as referral to the ICU.
在院病人的总人数每天都在变化，2月17日的数字是1096人，危重47，重症464，轻症585，有创机械通气1。
The total number of patients in the hospital varies from 1,096 on 17 February, 47 in critical condition, 464 in severe cases, 585 in minor cases and 1 in invasive mechanical ventilation.
因为ICU只有18张床位，因此不是所有的重症病人都能用上呼吸机，我们要求每层楼要建设2-3个亚重症单元，我们来配备呼吸机，也相当于重症病床，要让所有的队伍都动起来，全力救治重症病人。
Since the ICU has only 18 beds, not all critically ill patients have access to a ventilator. We require 2-3 sub-critical units per floor. We will be equipped with a ventilator, which is the equivalent of a serious hospital bed.

受访者供图剥洋葱：重症病人的氧气供应问题如何解决？陈国华：这确实是个问题。
Interviewees for Onion Exploitation: How to Solve the Problem of Oxygen Supply in Severe Patients? CHEN Kwok-wah: That's a real problem.
外科大楼以前只是做外科手术，现在要上呼吸机，有高流量氧气需求，我们跟氧气公司沟通，保证每天要有4个液氧罐供应，同时准备了200个氧气瓶，万一出现紧急情况，就启用氧气瓶。
The surgical building, which used to be a surgical operation, now has a ventilator and a high flow of oxygen. We communicate with Oxygen to ensure a daily supply of four liquid oxygen tanks, and we have 200 oxygen cylinders ready to be activated in the event of an emergency.
剥洋葱：收治这么多病人，医护人员数量够吗？陈国华：这么多病人，光靠原来呼吸、重症科室的医护人员肯定不够，医院其他科室都派员过来支持，先要进行防护知识、诊疗方案、院感防控方面的培训。
Chen Guohua: So many patients, rely on the original respiration, severe cases of the medical staff is certainly not enough, other departments of the hospital have sent staff to support the first, the diagnosis and treatment programmes, hospital prevention and control training.
后来国家救援队的到来很大程度上缓解了我们的压力。
Later, the arrival of the national rescue team to a large extent relieved our pressure.
目前支援我们的国家救援队有10支，我们在门诊大楼六楼成立联合医务处，每支援助队每天派一个人在这里值班，相当于大的综合办，每天早上大家在一起碰碰前一天的情况，及时发现问题、解决问题。
At present, there are 10 national rescue teams supporting us. We have set up a joint medical service on the sixth floor of the outpatient building, where one person per day from each team is on duty, equivalent to a large integrated office, where everyone gets together every morning to touch the situation the day before, identify problems and resolve them in a timely manner.
2月14日以来，有10支国家援助队支援武汉第一医院。
Since 14 February, 10 national aid teams have supported Wuhan Hospital No. 1.
受访者供图剥洋葱：医院原有的其他病人怎么办？陈国华：按照要求，收治新冠肺炎病人需要把其他病人都转走，当时一夜之间腾空了一栋楼，一部分病人安置到附近的湖北省中山医院、长航医院等，部分病情比较轻微的，尊重患者意见，可以办理出院回家，还有些是重症、危重症、戴呼吸机的，不能随便转院，就集中在门诊大楼10楼，安置在一个CCU病房里边，有20多人，医院单独配备医护人员。
Chen Guohua: According to the request, a building was vacated overnight, some patients were treated with respect for the opinions of the patients and could be discharged from the hospital. Others were seriously ill, critically ill or wearing respirators and could not be transferred to hospital.
另外，医院每天还有五六百个做透析的病人，这类病人不可能不给他们透析，这个任务还要承担，为了预防感染，治疗的同时我们也在给这些病人做新冠肺炎相关检查。
In addition, the hospital has five or six hundred dialysis patients every day, who are unlikely not to be dialyzed, a task that we have to take on. To prevent infection, we are also examining these patients for new crowns pneumonia.
“总的来说比以前有章法了”剥洋葱：疫情发生到现在，遇到最大的困难是什么？陈国华：刚开始物资是我最头疼的事儿，大年三十之后那几天，每天防护用品都告急，而且那会儿是病人最多的时候。
What's the biggest difficulty I've had so far? CHEN Kwok-wah: Starting out with supplies was one of my biggest headaches. In the days after New Year's Eve, every day was running out of supplies, and that was when the patients were at their peak.
那几天晚上我从医院出来，感觉非常焦虑、无助，也心疼医务人员。
I came out of the hospital the other night feeling very anxious, helpless, and distressed medical staff.
他们每天十几个小时在这里工作，还不能回家，我作为管理者，连自己员工的生命安全都保证不了，我怎么跟他们交代？大年三十的晚上，我吃完盒饭，就跟大家讨论，我们还有多少口罩，多少防护服，还能维持多少天。
They work here for more than a dozen hours a day and can't go home yet. As a manager, I can't guarantee the lives of my own employees.
我每天不停地给指挥部打电话，从社会各种渠道去搞防护服、口罩，也发起爱心募捐。
I constantly call the headquarters every day, from all kinds of social channels to get protective clothing, masks, but also launched a charitable fund-raising.
同时我们对医务人员使用防护服也严格要求，只有一线的进病房的人才能领防护服。
At the same time, we are strict about the use of protective clothing for medical personnel, only the first-line into the ward can receive protective clothing.
不过现在已经好多了，防护用品是由市指挥部来统一调配，多少医护人员，需要多少，报上去，每天配送过来，物资这一点基本已经缓解了。
However, now much better, protective equipment is unified deployment by the city headquarters, how many medical personnel, how much, reported, daily distribution, this has been basically alleviated.
国家医疗队通道。
National medical team access.
新京报记者 向凯 摄剥洋葱：疫情发生以来，你们的工作状态是怎样的？陈国华：我从1月21日（腊月二十七）之后就没回过家，一直在办公室住。
How well have you been working since the outbreak? CHEN Kwok-wah: I haven't been home since January 21 (27), and I've been living in my office.
我们很多医护人员也是在酒店、医院住。
Many of our medical staff also stay in hotels and hospitals.
在成为定点医院之前，我们也有发热门诊，收治发热患者；我们还参与了援建第五医院，我从大年三十过去援建，一直到初五才回来；之后又参加隔离点建设，与协和医院两家共同去建江汉方舱医院。
Before becoming a designated hospital, we also had a fever clinic to treat febrile patients. We also participated in the construction of the Fifth Hospital, which I helped build from the end of the year until the fifth day of junior high school.
一波接一波的工作，直到最近两天才稍微感觉平静一些。
Wave after wave of work did not feel a little calmer until the last two days.
当然改造定点医院的工作量还是最大的。
Of course, the renovation of designated hospitals is the largest workload.
现在，医护人员每4-6小时轮班一次，重症一般是4小时，其他的有些是6小时有些是8小时，有了国家援助队的帮助，现在跟之前比轻松了不少。
Today, health-care workers work shifts every four to six hours, with severe cases generally lasting four hours, others six hours and some eight hours. With the help of the National Assistance Team, it is now much easier than before.
剥洋葱：你们觉得应对疫情的形势发生了什么变化？陈国华：大年三十那几天，不仅是工作电话，还有些求救电话，亲戚、朋友、病人、职工，都来电话，要帮助解决住院问题，我只能回复他们想办法，但其实也没有办法。
Chen Guohua: In the past few days, there were not only working phone calls, but also some calls from relatives, friends, patients and workers. To help solve the problem of hospitalization, I had to answer their questions, but there was nothing I could do.
除夕那段时间主要是无序，工作量大、急迫，突然之间与病毒狭路相逢，刺刀见红，没有后援，只有拼命，那个时候是一片混沌状态。
The New Year's Eve period is mainly disorderly, workload, urgency, suddenly and narrow road with the virus, stabbing red, no back-up, only desperate, then is a chaotic state.
现在有所好转，形势每天都不一样，我每天处理的问题也不一样，还都是紧急的，但总的来说比以前有章法了。
Things are getting better now, things are different every day, I'm dealing with different issues every day, and they're all urgent, but on the whole more organized than before.
