文 | 邢海洋武汉有一位微博博主@八荒以后 的帖子引来了网友们的唏嘘。
Wen Xing Xing and Wuhan have a microblogger @ 8 famine after the post attracted netizens to sob.
封城之下，物资一直稳定，没有供应不足，但因为近日小区改变了管理规则，每隔三天才能采购一次，很多人去囤积，她家的储备不足，一时饿了肚子。
Under the blockade, supplies have been stable and not in short supply, but since the neighbourhood has recently changed its rules, buying only once every three days, many people hoard, her family has insufficient reserves and is hungry for a while.
博主@八荒以后 的求助帖子很快引来上万次的转发，网友们纷纷献计献策。
Blogger @ eight famine after the help post quickly attracted tens of thousands of forwarding, netizens have contributed ideas.
我们得以了解到疫区百姓的采购方式：那里很多小区每天都组织团购米、面、青菜、肉，甚至还有水果和蛋糕；长江日报公众号里有一个团菜，量有点大，可以找邻居拼；在没有物业的老小区，社区街道的工作人员会有组织送菜的方法；一些社区还有志愿者帮助采买和配送。
We were able to see how people in affected areas bought rice, pasta, vegetables, meat and even fruits and cakes on a daily basis in many neighborhoods; the Changjiang Daily Public Number had a large enough dish to go around; in old neighborhoods where there was no property, street staff organized the delivery of food; and some communities had volunteers to help with the procurement and distribution.
盒马生鲜可以给附近的居民送货，京东超市可能爆仓了但是可以送货。
Boxed horses can be delivered to nearby residents, and Jingdong may be empty but can deliver goods.
封城之下物资供应基本充足，买东西偶尔有困难，但是买不到也不可能。
Supplies are almost plentiful under the siege, and it is sometimes difficult to buy, but impossible to buy.
1月28日，北京某超市内，民众带着口罩选购商品春节期间，当人们第一次意识到要宅在家里，要做好长期宅的准备时，多地曾经冒出菜荒”，酒店饭馆眼看营业无望，将后厨的生鲜菜肴抛售出来，缓解了菜荒。
During the Spring Festival, when people first realized they had to stay at home and get ready for a long-term home, there was a shortage of vegetables at a supermarket in Beijing. "Restaurants are desperate to sell their fresh dishes, relieving a shortage of vegetables.
此后食物供应渐趋平稳，美菜、盒马、京东和每日优鲜等生鲜App，乃至邻里菜蔬小店也趁机扩张，送菜上门渐成主流购物方式，销量普遍是平日里的数倍，以至于频频爆仓，不得不调整配送时间。
Since then, food supplies have leveled off, with fresh App, Boxed Horse, Jingdong and Daily Premium, and even neighbourhood greengrocers taking advantage of the opportunity to expand and deliver food door-to-door.
与年前唯一不同的是，即使你网上下了单，菜也不能送到家门口，你得自己到小区门口去取。
The only difference is that even if you place an order online, it can't be delivered to your door. You have to pick it up in front of the neighborhood.
本来，春节人手不足，快递按惯例要“慢递”上一阵子。
Originally, the Spring Festival is understaffed, express delivery in accordance with the practice of "slow delivery" for a while.
这个春节尤其慢。
The Spring Festival is especially slow.
刚刚同事杨璐还在晒她从东京海购口罩的经历，她1月31日从东京快递出来的口罩，2月17日才转运到北京，没送到家呢。
Just coworker Yang Lu is still bask in her experience buying masks from Tokyo. Her face mask, which she courier from Tokyo on January 31, was shipped to Beijing on February 17.
而我自己从唐山购买的些日用品，也是半个月后才送到的。
And I bought some daily necessities from Tangshan myself, which was delivered only half a month later.
特殊时期，快递慢了下来，要么迟迟不发货，要么迟迟不到货。
Special times, express delivery slowed down, either late delivery, or late arrival of goods.
个别情况下，因为封路的原因还遭遇退单，因为物价变动，商家还会反悔。
In some cases, due to the closure of the road also encountered a refund, because of price changes, businesses will also retract.
闲在家里的消费者本来就无聊，于是每天N遍地刷快递信息，主观感受上，快递更“慢”了。
The consumer that idles at home is bored originally, so every day N ground brush express information, subjective feeling, express more "slow".
本来令国人骄傲的“新四大发明”之一的网购，体验一下子变得不那么好了。
Originally proud of the "New Four Great Inventions," one of the online purchase, the experience suddenly became less good.
憋在斗室之中，网购本可以承担后勤保障和打发时间、分散注意力的功能，可迟迟不到的快递反而加重了人们的心理负担。
Pent up in the bucket room, online purchase could bear the logistics and kill time, distraction function, but the late arrival of express delivery has increased the psychological burden.
快递何其慢？只有个例，没有统计数据，这里不妨从淘宝都不得不改变了发货和收货时间上感受一下：发货时间上，淘宝对卖家的要求改为须在买家付款后48小时内点击发货，并在点击发货后72小时内完成揽收。
How slow is express delivery? For example, without statistics, we may have to change our delivery and delivery times: On delivery time, Taobao requires the seller to click on the shipment within 48 hours of payment by the buyer and complete the order within 72 hours of delivery.
也就是说从接单到快递揽收，足有5天的时限。
That is, from order to express collection, a full five-day time limit.
收货方面，通过快递、EMS发货的，自“卖家已发货”状态起的20日后，系统会自动确认收货。
On the receiving end, if the goods are shipped by express or EMS, the receipt will be confirmed automatically 20 days after the "seller has shipped" status.
这就意味着从买家下单到收货，平台为商品在路上留出了足足22天的时间，比过去多出来一倍。
That means buying orders from buyers to receiving goods, and the platform allows a full 22 days for goods on the road, twice as many as in the past.
2020年2月14日，北京迎来降雪天气，快递小哥忙着送货。
February 14, 2020, Beijing ushered in snow weather, express brother busy delivery.
图 | 视觉中国2月10日起，各大快递公司均宣布了复工，但据G7物联网平台&车满满2月16日数据，全国物流运输状况仍受到疫情较大影响，整车物流流量对比旺季恢复率为22%，作为商贸流通毛细血管的零担物流恢复率则仅为1.1%。
Since February 10, companies have announced plans to resume work, but with a full G7 service at & nbsp; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;%.
为把疫情风险降低到最小，各地对复工有严格的限制，处于产业链中的企业，也因为上下游的联动，互相牵制着难以满负荷运行。
In order to minimize the risk of epidemic, there are severe restrictions on the resumption of work, enterprises in the industrial chain, but also because of upstream and downstream linkages, each other to control the full load of the operation.
物流业是联系各行各业以及消费者的血液循环系统，如果机体丧失了活力，循环系统也难以独立高效率运行。
Logistics is a blood circulation system that connects all trades and consumers. If the body loses vitality, the circulation system is difficult to run independently and efficiently.
且如果贸然开足马力，就面临着无米之炊的境地。
And if the rush to full horsepower, there is no rice to face the picnics.
举步维艰的物流业，对于规模化复工多是观望的态度。
Difficult logistics industry, for large-scale return to work is a wait-and-see attitude.
去年初曾有一份调查显示，76.31%的快递员来自农村，15.89%的快递员来自县城，仅有7.8%来自城市。
A survey early last year showed that 76.31 per cent of couriers came from rural areas, 15.89 per cent from county capitals and 7.8 per cent from cities.
我们可以据此推测，有八、九成的快递员并非本地人，而是外来人口。
We can infer that 80 to 90% of couriers are not locals, but foreigners.
人社部统计的数据显示，我国外出农民工有1.7亿多人，截止到目前，其中大多数的人还没有踏上返程。
Statistics from the Ministry of Human Services show that there are more than 170 million migrant workers in China, most of whom have not yet set foot on the return journey.
返回大城市的路途遥遥，严控之下更是步步阻碍。
It was a long way back to the big city, and under tight control.
近日有来自政府方面的报道，云南昭通的返乡过节务工人员，居然是在政府工作人员和医务人员护送下，搭乘返岗专车回浙江的工厂上班，可见外来人员返城之难。
A government source recently reported that migrant workers in Zhaotong, Yunnan province, were returning to work in factories in Zhejiang province in a special bus escorted by government workers and medical personnel.
而快递公司在大城市的神经末梢多是加盟店，规模小，结构松散，哪有可能被政府护送着，组团点对点地返城打工。
And the express company in the big city nerve endings are more allied stores, small in size, loose structure, how can be escorted by the government, back to the city point to point to work.
2018年8月24日，武汉，饿了么外卖小哥在汉口街头休息。
August 24, 2018, Wuhan, hungry take-out brother in Hankou street rest.
图 | 视觉中国即使他们踏上了返回大城市的旅程，按照北京和上海等大城市的要求，外来者也需要先自行隔离14天才能够开始工作，这就使得短期内快递业的用工荒根本没办法缓解。
Even as they embark on the journey back to big cities, Beijing and Shanghai require outsiders to isolate themselves for up to 14 days before they can start work, leaving the industry without any way to alleviate the shortage of workers in the short term.
携程创始人、人口学家梁建章就认为，当前社会为了部分过度的隔离政策，正在付出沉重的经济代价。
Liang Jianzhang, founder of Ctrip and a demographer, argues that society is paying a heavy economic price for some of the excessive segregation policies.
而整个社会不能创造财富，现有的财富并不能支撑很久。
And society as a whole cannot create wealth, and existing wealth will not last long.
到时候，不只快递小哥没了积蓄，企业没了钱，作为消费者的居民，也会“囊中羞涩”。
When the time comes, not only courier younger brother has no savings, business has no money, as a consumer of the residents, will "cash shy."
那时候将不是我们为收不到快递而焦虑，而是为买不起网购商品而心慌。
It will be not that we worry about not getting express delivery, but that we can't afford to buy things online.
对于广大的市民，让快递进小区，无疑是提高快递效率最现实、也最为力所能及的办法。
For the vast number of citizens, express delivery into the community, is undoubtedly the most realistic and efficient way to improve express delivery.
几乎所有的快递自提箱都建在小区内，若快递能进来，小哥们不用在风中苦苦等待，双方不必接触就能完成交接。
Almost all courier cartons are built in small areas, and if couriers can come in, the little buddies don't have to wait in the wind to complete the handover without having to touch each other.
而把快递阻挡在小区门外的做法，空耗了快递小哥的人力和时间，使“最后一公里”的投递，难上加难。
And block express in the cell door practice, air consumed the manpower and time of courier, so that "the last kilometer" of the delivery, more difficult.
