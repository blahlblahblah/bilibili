燃财经（ID:rancaijing）原创作者 | 闫丽娇编辑 | 阿伦疫情对各行各业都产生了巨大影响，尤其是在企业用工方面。
Yan-lijiao, former creator and founder of Fun Finance, has had a huge impact on every walk of life, especially in the area of corporate employment.
由于人力严重不足，人力使用效率变得异常关键。
Due to severe manpower constraints, efficiency in the use of human resources has become critical.
更少的人意味着需要更敏捷、更高效的组织方式。
Fewer people mean the need for a more agile and efficient organization.
快仓智能联合创始人孙宇认为，这次疫情会对很多经营者的意识产生巨大冲击。
Sun Yu, co-founder of Quick Warehouse Intelligence, said the outbreak would have a huge impact on the consciousness of many operators.
“疫情发生以前，消耗巨大成本所完成的技术升级改造，产生的效用短时间内无法显现，所以经营者更愿意投入更多人力而非技术解决问题。
"Before the outbreak, technology upgrades, which cost a lot of money, produced effects that could not be felt anytime soon, so operators were more willing to put in more manpower than technology to solve the problem."
这次疫情期间的人力不足，会让更多人意识到机器替代人工所发挥的长期价值。
The lack of manpower during the epidemic will make more people aware of the long-term value of machines replacing human labour.
”此前，快仓智能完成了来自创世伙伴资本CCV、软银中国、菜鸟网络的多轮融资。
Previously, FTSE had completed multiple rounds of financing from Genesis partner Capital CCV, Softbank China, and the Nissan Network.
另一方面，海外市场的巨大空间对AI创业者也意味着巨大机遇。
On the other hand, the vast space in overseas markets also represents a huge opportunity for AI entrepreneurs.
快仓曾到日本的一处电商仓库考察，80多岁的老人还在从事货物分拣工作。
Speedpost visited an electrical warehouse in Japan, where 80-year-olds are still sorting cargo.
发达国家不断上升的人力成本以及不断严重的老龄化问题，对想用机器替代人工劳动的创业者来说都是机会。
Rising human costs and rising ageing in developed countries are opportunities for entrepreneurs seeking to replace manual labour with machines.
2月27日，燃财经举办线上沙龙，讨论AI行业还有哪些新机会。
On Feb. 27, Flaming Finance hosted an online salon to discuss new opportunities for the AI industry.
华创资本合伙人熊伟铭、旷视副总裁谢忆楠、快仓智能联合创始人孙宇，分别进行了主题分享，并与燃财经总编辑贺树龙进行对话。
Huacheng Capital Partners Xiong Weiming, absentee vice-president Xie Yangnan, co-founder of QC Intelligence Co-founder Sun Yu, had a topic-sharing session and had a dialogue with He Shulong, the chief financial editor of Flaming Finance.
•劳动力绝对短缺的情况虽然比较少，但劳动力资源在不同行业间分布的不均衡现象比较严重；•疫情推进了人对机器的依赖，为后续机器替换人工提供了长期动力；•疫情凸显出来的公共卫生领域的种种不足，必将在后续的相关投资中，出现“报复性投资”；•疫情带来的一大困难是如何进行远距离协同；•无人车、无人机等开放环境下的最后一公里业务，常态化运作还有困难，主要挑战在于环境复杂性、法律风险不确定性等因素，大规模推广还需要时间。
The epidemic has increased human dependence on machines, providing a long-term incentive to replace human labor with machines; the public-health deficiencies highlighted by the epidemic will inevitably lead to "retaliatory investment" in subsequent investments; the last kilometer of open-air operations, such as unmanned vehicles and drones, will be difficult to normalize.
以下为孙宇在燃财经沙龙上的分享内容：疫情之下，人力使用效率变得很关键，更少的人意味着需要更敏捷、更高效的组织方式。
Here is what Sun Yu shared at the Financial Salon: Under the epidemic, human efficiency becomes critical, and fewer people mean the need for a more agile and efficient organization.
所以这次疫情会对很多企业经营者的意识产生巨大冲击。
So this epidemic will have a huge impact on the consciousness of many business operators.
以前觉得，技术升级改造需要花很多钱，且短期效果不明显，所以企业主更喜欢用更多人力解决效能问题。
It used to be felt that technological upgrading was costly and that short-term results were not obvious, so business owners preferred to use more manpower to solve efficiency problems.
疫情期间人力短缺带来的负面影响显而易见，恰恰让更多人看到人工智能的作用。
The negative impact of manpower shortages during the epidemic is clear, and it is precisely the role of artificial intelligence that is becoming more visible.
长期来看，这种意识层面的变化将为后续机器替换人工提供长期动力。
In the long run, this change in consciousness will provide a long-term incentive for subsequent machines to replace humans.
微观上说，已经出现劳动力的相对短缺。
At the micro level, there is already a relative shortage of labour.
举个例子，2019年，快仓惠阳仓库边新开了一家比亚迪的电池组装厂。
For example, in 2019, a new BYD battery assembly plant was opened next to the warehouse in Huiyang, Qusang.
因为工作强度低、工资高、环境好、有空调，吸引了很多工人。
Because of the low intensity of work, high wages, good environment, air conditioning, attracted a lot of workers.
2019年双11，我们提前3个月招工都找不到工人，只能提前把人养起来，留到双11备用。
2019 double 11, we can not find workers three months in advance of the recruitment, can only be raised in advance, to double 11 reserve.
劳动力绝对短缺的情况虽然比较少，但劳动力资源在不同行业间分布不均衡现象比较突出。
Although the absolute shortage of labor is relatively small, the uneven distribution of labor resources among different industries is more prominent.
像仓库这种工作强度大、环境恶劣、单调重复的工作，越来越多被90后、00后嫌弃，企业必须提早应对。
Such as warehouse work intensity, bad environment, monotonous repetition of work, more and more after 90, 00 after aversion, enterprises must respond early.
2019年双11，菜鸟无锡仓库通过使用近一千台机器人，在没有增加一兵一卒的情况下，取得了天猫超市全网发货量第一的好成绩，无疑是对机器人能力的一个很好证明。
In 2019, the rookie Wuxi warehouse used nearly a thousand robots, without adding a single soldier, to get the best results of the Sky Cat Supermarket network, no doubt a good proof of robotic capability.
当企业主有了机器替代人的意识以后如何推进呢？我认为主要有三个方向：无人化（少人化）、智能化和数字驱动运营。
How do business owners move forward when they have a sense of machine replacement? I think there are three main directions: dehumanization (depersonalization), intellectualization, and digital-driven operations.
商品链路的四大环节分别包括产、仓、运、配。
The four links of commodity link include production, storage, transportation and distribution respectively.
快仓目前主要集中在生产环节和仓储环节，实现无人化的主要手段是实现搬运工作的自动化，我们内部叫做实现“四面墙内的智能驾驶”。
The main means to realize the depersonalization is to automate the moving work. We call it "intelligent driving on all sides."
搬运活动作为人类的基本活动，要么是人搬，要么就是机器搬。
Movement, as a basic human activity, is either carried out by humans or by machines.
机器通过搬运工作，创造了基础价值，这也是智能搬运设备的内在商业逻辑。
The machine creates the basic value by moving the work, which is the inherent business logic of intelligent handling equipment.
从地域上说，海外市场具有非常好的机会。
Geographically, there are very good opportunities in overseas markets.
一是发达国家的劳动力成本普遍很高，另外一个是发达国家的老龄化严重。
One is the generally high labour costs in developed countries and the other is the high level of ageing in developed countries.
我们去日本考察，在一个电商仓库里，竟然还有80岁的老人拣货，着实让我们很震惊。
When we visited Japan, we were shocked to find an 80-year-old man picking things up in an electrical warehouse.
所以，海外市场一定是必争之地。
Therefore, overseas markets must be the place to compete.
另外，本次疫情凸显出来的公共卫生领域的种种不足，必将在后续的国家相关投资中，出现“报复性投资”。
In addition, the epidemic highlights the public health field of deficiencies, in the subsequent state-related investment, there will be "retaliatory investment."
对话孙宇：燃财经：疫情对快仓业务的影响有多大？疫情期间，哪些客户的需求在增加？哪些客户的需求在减少？快仓目前复工情况如何？预计业务全面恢复会在什么时候？孙宇：医药类客户需求在增加，因为医药领域我们的市占率比较高，所以能体会到变化。
Dialogue Script 2 2 Sun Yu: What is the impact of the epidemic on the fast-moving business? During the epidemic, which customers are increasing their demand? What is the current status of the fast-moving positions? When is the full recovery expected? Sun Yu: The demand for pharmaceutical customers is increasing because our market share in medicine is relatively high.
需求减少其实没有，但是项目会有延期问题。
There is no reduction in demand, but there are delays in the project.
目前快仓湖北外的同事，基本都复工了，但业务恢复情况，还要看疫情发展。
At present, the colleagues outside the fast warehouse Hubei, are basically back to work, but business recovery, but also depends on the development of the epidemic.
燃财经：疫情之下，快仓智能为医药、电商、物流、制造行业提供了一些配送支持，过程中面临哪些挑战，现在运行的情况如何？孙宇：医药物资的配送，包括药品、医疗器械等，目前来看系统状态良好、平稳运行。
Under the epidemic situation, Qushuangintelligence has provided some distribution support to the pharmaceutical, electrical, logistics and manufacturing industries, what are the challenges in the process, and how is it running nowSun Yu: The distribution of medical and related materials, including medicines and medical devices, is in good condition and running smoothly at present.
我们有个客户就在武汉当地，负责湖北的医药配送。
We have a customer in Wuhan, responsible for Hubei medicine distribution.
疫情期间，我们专门安排了人为他提供技术支持，防止因为订单量增大而导致系统不稳定。
During the outbreak, we specially arranged to provide technical support to him to prevent the increase of orders and lead to system instability.
燃财经：“无接触配送”概念很火，快仓主打机器人配送，疫情过去之后，“无接触配送”能否成为新趋势？ 孙宇：我们已经涉猎了一些新零售业务，包括“无人药房”模型。
Can "no contact distribution" become a new trend after the epidemic is over? Sun Yu: We have covered a number of new retail businesses, including the "no-man's-pharmacy" model.
无接触配送已经是逐渐开展的业务，但是开放环境的最后一公里其实比较困难，无人车常态化运作还有挑战。
Contact-free distribution has become a growing business, but the last kilometer of the open environment is actually difficult, and there are challenges to the normal operation of unmanned vehicles.
主要挑战在于环境复杂性、法律风险不确定性等因素，大规模推广还有一定困难。
The main challenge lies in the complexity of the environment, legal risk uncertainty and other factors, large-scale promotion is still difficult.
所以为什么强调四面墙内的智能驾驶，相比室外环境的智能驾驶模式，它在受限环境内的复杂度更低，实现起来更容易。
So why emphasize intelligent driving in four walls, it is less complicated and easier to implement than the intelligent driving mode in outdoor environment.
燃财经：所以，无人车、无人机最后一公里配送目前还是概念和噱头为主？无法大规模普及？孙宇：是的。
So is the concept and gimmicks still dominating the last kilometer of distribution of unmanned vehicles and drones? SUN: Yes.
比如受天气的影响，无人机可能没办法运送。
For example, because of weather conditions, drones may not be able to deliver.
无人车也是一样的，需要有相关配套的法律，包括会遇到中国复杂的路况等。
The same is true of unmanned vehicles, which require relevant supporting laws, including complex road conditions in China.
我恰恰认为，无人车的应用应该是在乘用车和商用车。
I just think that the use of unmanned vehicles should be in passenger and commercial vehicles.
如果是在运输环节，我对无人集卡（无人驾驶集装箱卡车）这种产品形态比较看好，尤其是干线物流的无人集卡。
If it is in transportation, I am more optimistic about the unattended truck (unmanned container truck) product form, especially the trunk logistics of the unmanned card.
燃财经：给医院送药品、送耗材都需要高准确性，从技术上怎样保证不出错？有哪些挑战和难点？孙宇：医药行业整体物流水平都比较高，药品、医疗器械在管理上还是比较完善的，基本都是全程条码追溯。
What are the challenges and difficulties? Sun Yu: The overall level of logistics in the pharmaceutical industry is relatively high, and the management of drugs and medical devices is relatively perfect, basically all the way back to the bar code.
我们作业也是基于这些条码，在入库、出库、拣选、复核等环节严格按照指示，基本可以保证99.999%以上的准确率。
Our work is also based on these barcodes, in warehousing, warehousing, selection, review and other links in strict accordance with instructions, can basically ensure that more than 99.999% of the accuracy.
燃财经：快仓的盈利方式主要有哪些？这个行业整体的盈利前景怎么样？孙宇：提供智能仓储物流整体解决方案的商业模式。
Flaming Finance: What are the main ways to make quick profits? How is the industry as a whole going to make money? Sun Yu: A business model that provides integrated solutions for intelligent warehousing logistics.
我认为，这个行业是一个朝阳行业，未来将拥有较大的市场容量和长远的发展空间。
I think this industry is a sunrise industry, the future will have a large market capacity and long-term development space.
