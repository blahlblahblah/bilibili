摘要：“管全家人吃喝生活，算不算有价值的事情？”这个春天，人人都被关在家里，吃饭，睡觉，刷手机。
"Food and drink for the whole family is not a valuable thing?" This spring, everyone was shut up at home, eating, sleeping and wiping their mobile phones.
但她们的生活有些不同。
But their lives are a little different.
她们张罗着全家的一日三餐，留意着哪里有口罩、消毒液，担忧着家人的健康，更迫切渴望能回到深圳复工，却仍看不到希望。
They eat three meals a day, watch where there are masks, disinfectant, worry about the health of their families, more eager to return to Shenzhen to work, but still do not see hope.
她们是湖北籍女工。
They are Hubei female workers.
“到处都用铁丝网铁皮封锁起来”在深圳打工十几年，这是万万在湖北天门老家过得最长的一个春节。
"Everywhere with barbed wire fences" in Shenzhen to work for more than 10 years, this is the Hubei Tianmen home for the longest Spring Festival.
在深圳这个工作不停歇的城市，往年一过初八就会迎来轰轰烈烈的复工潮，八百万外来工中，有相当一部分是湖北人。
In Shenzhen, where the work does not stop, the past eight years will usher in a strong return to work, eight million migrant workers, a considerable number of Hubei people.
常来绿色蔷薇社会工作服务中心的姐妹们，在工厂，在工地，做餐饮，做文员……深圳的GDP，也是她们一手一脚做起来的。
The sisters who often come to the Green Rose Social Work Service Center, work in factories, construction sites, catering, clerical... Shenzhen's GDP is also done by hand.
但是现在：“我们村都封了，出入口都封了，街道口也都封了，到处都用铁丝网铁皮封锁起来，像打仗那样。
But now: "Our villages are sealed, the entrances and exits sealed, the streets sealed with barbed wire, like war.
”万万说，“坐车更是想都不要想。
"Don't even think about it," he said.
”她原本计划坐侄子的公交车去镇上，再从镇上转车来深圳，结果镇上通知公交车停运，侄子也不能把车开出去。
She had planned to take her nephew's bus to the town and change from town to Shenzhen, but the town had told the bus to stop and her nephew could not drive it out.
湖北孝感的璐璐、湖北荆州的乐萱，因为疫情封锁，一个多月没出过门了。
Hubei filial Lu Lu, Hubei Jingzhou Le Xuan, because of the epidemic blockade, more than a month did not go out.
这几个地方都是此次疫情的重灾区，空荡荡的大街充满了消毒水的味道，背后不知上演着多少生离死别。
These places are the main disaster areas of the epidemic, empty streets full of the smell of disinfectant, do not know how many lives staged.
返乡路大多会经过武汉，而大家当时对病毒还缺乏警惕，回家后听说消息后则惶惶不安，直到在家待满14天才开始放心。
Most of the way home will pass Wuhan, and everyone was still lack of vigilance on the virus, home after hearing the news, until the 14 days at home began to relax.
万万听说最近新确诊的一例离自己家不过几百米，就更不敢出门了。
Ten million people hear that a newly diagnosed case is only a few hundred meters away from their home, they are afraid to go out.
万万老家村里的宣传语（照片均为工友本人提供）在她们回不去的深圳，来自湖北黄冈的依依则是20年来第一次在外过年，但她急切地盼望着城市解封，好让她回老家去看看独自一人生活的老妈妈。
In Huanggang, Huanggang, Huanggang for the first time in 20 years, but she is eager to see the city unsealed so that she can go home and see her old mother living alone.
她们之间，是一道道铁皮和铁丝网制成的关卡。
Between them were iron and barbed wire barriers.
“每天都在琢磨给家人吃什么”村庄、小区一封，买菜做饭就成了一个问题，一个通常都会落在女人身上的问题。
"Everyday I wonder what to eat for my family." One village, one community, buying and cooking is a problem, one that usually falls on women.
“都是我去买菜。
"I went shopping.
相对来说还是我更适合一些。
Relatively speaking I am more suitable.
”虽然还在深圳，依依暂时无法回到做了20年的服装厂车板师岗位，照顾骨折的丈夫、生病的婆婆、无法返学的儿子，外加负责全家人的一日三餐，就成了依依的工作。
Although still in Shenzhen, Yiyi is temporarily unable to return to her 20-year-old garment factory as a palanquist, caring for her fractured husband, sick mother-in-law, son unable to return to school and responsible for the family's three meals a day.
依依的丈夫平时会一起买菜做饭，但他年前意外骨折还没好利索；婆婆本身年纪大，又做了手术，抵抗力差；上大学的儿子倒是身强体壮，但他压根儿不认识蔬菜，跟去菜市场相比，他还是更愿意在家刷刷手机、上上网课。
Her mother-in-law was old and had surgery, and her resistance was weak. But he didn't know anything about vegetables, so he preferred to brush his cell phone and go to the Internet classes at home.
一家人要吃要喝，自己不出去谁出去呢？虽然买菜可以上网买，但鱼啊肉啊，还是自己去选比较放心。
The family wants to eat and drink, do not go out who go out? Although the purchase of vegetables can buy online, but fish and meat ah, or to choose their own more at ease.
猪肉涨价涨得让人不敢买。
The price of pork is rising too high to buy.
平时28、29块一斤，过年那两天飞涨到五十多也就罢了，现在38、39一斤是常态。
Usually 28, 29 yuan a catty, the past two days skyrocketed to more than 50 also just, now 38, 39 catty is normal.
“好贵啊！”依依感叹道，“所以我们都很少吃肉，经常吃蔬菜，但是想一想，老人家身体不好，老公生病了，还有小孩都需要营养，所以还是要买一点肉。
"How expensive!" Yi sighed, "so we all eat little meat, often eat vegetables, but think about the elderly people are not healthy, husband is ill, and children need nutrition, so still want to buy some meat.
我们就买点肉回来煲汤，煮个面条配个汤吃就可以了。
Let's just buy some meat and bring back soup. Boil noodles with a soup.
过年那天晚饭也是这样的。
It was the same for dinner on New Year's Eve.
”回到孝感的璐璐本来并不担心蔬菜，因为父母种了很多菜，加上年前囤了不少年货，食材还算足够。
Lu returned to her filial piety and did not worry about the vegetables, because her parents had grown a lot of food, which was good enough for the new year, according to the source.
但是随着时间一天天过去，她也开始为物资发愁，每天都要计算食物还能维持多久。
But as the days passed, she began to worry about supplies, counting how long the food would last.
小孩上四年级，正是需要营养的时候，但牛奶和鸡蛋慢慢变得奢侈起来。
Children in the fourth grade, is precisely the time to need nutrients, but milk and eggs slowly become luxurious.
万万也一样。
And so it is.
虽然囤了年货，但还是打算省着吃，“细水长流”，因为不知道封锁什么时候结束。
Although the new year, but still intend to save eat, "long stream," because do not know when the closure will end.
好在做家务也给这些勤劳乐观的女性带来乐趣。
Fortunately, doing housework also brings fun to these industrious and optimistic women.
依依在家琢磨电饭煲蛋糕，万万换着花样做白菜炖肉、萝卜炖肉、萝卜炖鱼，璐璐还把萝卜换个花样做出来，再弄个漂亮的造型。
At home, she thought about rice cooker cakes and changed into cabbage stew, radish stew, radish stew, Lu Lu also changed radish out of a pattern, and make a beautiful look.
万万给家人准备的“爱心早餐”水果、馒头片和粥璐璐的自制萝卜条“我干了很多家务，是不能算作干活的”乐萱是这次遇到的唯一一个不做饭还理直气壮的姐妹。
"I do a lot of housework, is not counted as a work" Le Xuan is the only encounter with a strong sister who does not cook.
“我们家我哥做饭。
"My brother cooks in our house.
”乐萱轻快的声音从话筒里传出来，“我哥做饭还是不错的。
"Le Xuan's brisk voice came from the microphone.
我妈说了，我哥必须得会做饭，将来不能老是让媳妇儿做。
My mother said my brother must be able to cook, and he can't always let his wife do it.
不能像我们家一样，我爸天天啥也不干，然后就让我妈做饭。
I can't be like my family. My dad doesn't do anything every day, and then he lets my mom cook.
”但说起做家务这事儿，乐萱还是恼火：“我哥洗个菜那叫干活，做饭也叫干活；我扫地，拖地，擦桌子，收拾屋子，这些都不叫干活。
"But when it comes to housework, she says," My brother washes a dish that is called work, and cooking is called work; I sweep the floor, mop the floor, clean the table, and clean the house.
我爸天天说：‘我闺女可真懒哎，什么都不干。
My father says every day: 'My daughter is really lazy.
’”在她家的一家之主老爸看来，做饭不属于男人该做的事，做了就是正正经经的“干活”。
The head of the family sees cooking not as a man's job, but as "doing the right thing."
那女人呢？洗碗、拖地、洗衣服、带孩子，都是女人的分内事，是随手一做的事情。
What about that woman? Washing dishes, mowing the floor, washing clothes, and raising children are all women's jobs, things to do at random.
居民不能出门买菜，生活用品统一由网格员代购（照片由乐萱提供）然而，这些需要做的事情并不少。
Residents are not allowed to go out to buy vegetables, and household items are bought by grid workers (photos provided by Le Xuan).
璐璐家四世同堂，虽然人多，但她不想父母太累，自己就主动多做点事情。
Lu Lu's fourth generation, although many people, but she did not want her parents tired, she took the initiative to do more things.
依依的出租屋本来是和老公两个人住，现在婆婆、儿子都来了，住不下，自己就只好去工厂的宿舍住，每天早上来到家里做卫生、做饭，晚上再回宿舍。
Now that his mother-in-law and son were unable to stay, he had to go to the dormitory of the factory. Every morning he came home to do some cleaning, cooking and going back to the dormitory at night.
万万时不时要蒸米糕和馒头给家人吃，还坚持每天用消毒水把楼上楼下都拖一遍。
Every once in a while, he steamed rice cakes and steamed buns for his family and insisted on dragging the stairs and downstairs with disinfectant every day.
这是她们对家庭责任的分担，是对老人的照顾，是对家人健康的担忧。
This is their share of family responsibilities, care for the elderly and concern for the health of their families.
并不是什么随手一做的琐碎小事。
It's not a trivial thing to do.
“管全家人吃喝生活，算不算有价值的事情？”这些平常就不受重视、不被承认的家务劳动和照顾工作，在疫情下变得更多、更重了。
"Food and drink for the whole family is not a valuable thing?" These often-neglected and unacknowledged tasks of domestic work and care become more and more important in the face of the epidemic.
璐璐每天早上要提醒孩子打卡、准备上网课，上午下午分别监督小孩上两节网课，还要和孩子一起做老师布置的手工、手语舞等作业。
Every morning Lulu reminds her children to punch in and prepare for online lessons. In the morning and afternoon, she supervises the children's two classes.
她经常没办法拿到手机回复信息，也不像平常那样，每天按时上班、每周一次大扫除，现在是天天都要做家务，“感觉有点虚度光阴”。
She often has no way to get her cell phone back, she doesn't go to work on time every day, does a weekly cleaning, does housework every day and "feels a bit wasted."
自从听说另一个小区有人确诊，村里就发了消毒粉，万万用消毒粉兑水来拖地，是每天都拖！老公上班，女儿上网课，万万就承包了比深圳的出租屋大几倍的房子的卫生。
Since hearing that someone in another small area had been diagnosed, the village had sent out disinfectant powder to mop the floor with disinfectant powder to mop the floor every day!
万万每天清早起床给地板消毒依依到处留意购买口罩和消毒水的信息，还不敢让老人小孩出门，为了买菜也要咬牙全副武装地出门。
Get up early every morning to disinfect the floor. Follow the directions to buy masks and disinfect water, and don't let the old children go out.
因为不能开工，她在家坐一会儿就想做点什么家务，婆婆也总是要洗碗，她们觉得“不动一下就不舒服”，但是儿子和老公却可以一直玩手机，坐着玩一会儿再躺着玩。
Because she can't start, she sits at home for a while and wants to do some housework, and her mother-in-law always washes the dishes. They feel "uncomfortable if they don't move," but their sons and husbands can play with their cell phones and sit around and play.
依依说：“怎么感觉做的事情没有上班那么多，却比上班还累呢？是心累！要操心的事情太多了，可是一闲下来，又想找点有意义的事情来做。
"How do you feel like you're not doing so much work, but you're more tired than you're at work? You're tired! There's so much to worry about, but when you're idle, you want to find something meaningful to do.
”我问：“你要管全家人的吃喝生活，这算不算有价值的事情？”她听了这句话就笑了，说也算有意义。
"I asked," You should take care of your family's food and drink, which is not a valuable thing? "She laughed and said it made sense.
“跟那些患病的人比起来，我们这样已经很好了，毕竟全家人还在一起能吵能闹，能够照顾他们的健康。
"We're doing fine compared to the sick people, because the family is still together and can be noisy and take care of their health.
”女性承担的巨量的家务劳动和照顾工作，需要我们自己先去承认和赞扬。
The enormous amount of housework and care work that women do requires us to acknowledge and praise ourselves.
“好想回去哦”大家都在渴望回深圳开工，因为家务劳动不被重视的一个结果是，在家做家务拿不到钱。
People are eager to go back to Shenzhen to start work, because one result of the neglect of domestic work is that they can't get paid to do housework at home.
“在家怎么说，是轻松一点，也没有很舒服，主要是没有经济来源。
"It's easy to say at home, and it's not very comfortable, mainly because there's no source of money.
”万万是这么考虑的，在深圳虽然辛苦，虽然几平米的出租屋不宽敞，但是刨去600块房租水电，刨去300块生活费，每个月还能剩一两千块。
Ten million is so considered, although in Shenzhen although the hard, although a few square meters of rental housing is not spacious, but planing away 600 rent, water and electricity, gouging away 300 yuan of living expenses, can still have one or two thousand dollars a month.
现在呢？因为年纪大了只能打零工，不开工就意味着没有收入。
What about now? Because older people have to work part-time, not working means no income.
“在家我也没有花太多钱，问题就是要继续交深圳的房租，我又没有多少钱，希望能早一点赚钱……我好想回去哦。
"I didn't spend much money at home, the problem is to continue to pay Shenzhen rent, I do not have much money, hope to make money earlier... I really want to go back Oh.
”依依家的租金单12平米的房间，租金800在深圳的依依则能够感受到对湖北人的警惕。
Relying on her 12-square-metre room rent of 800 square meters in Shenzhen, Hubei people can feel the vigilance.
她儿子在江西上大学，疫情爆发后，学校给所有湖北学生建了一个群，说湖北人返校问题要另行通知，这种被区别对待的感觉不是很好。
Her son went to university in Jiangxi. After the outbreak, the school built a group for all Hubei students, saying that Hubei people should be notified separately.
依依所在的工厂已经有几个人复工了：“没有通知我，不知道是不是因为我是湖北人。
Several people had already returned to work at the factory where they were working. "I don't know if it's because I'm from Hubei.
具体是什么人去上班也不清楚。
It's unclear exactly who went to work.
”问到璐璐是否有类似的担忧时，她在早上七点孩子上网课前回复我：“什么时候能出门无法估计，要城市解封才行。
Asked if Lulu had similar concerns, she replied to me before the 7 a.m. class: "It's impossible to estimate when you can go out.
我们不会给社会添乱，按指令能出去的时候再出门。
We don't mess with society. We go out when we can go out under orders.
湖北人不等于病毒。
Hubei people are not equal to virus.
