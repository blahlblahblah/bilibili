解封复工的消息不断传来，公园的花开了，路上的车多了起来，城市复活了。
The news of the release of the workers continued, the flowers in the park bloomed, cars on the road increased and the city came to life.
有人回归车间和工位，更多人早已开始远程办公。
Some have returned to workshops and workplaces, and many more are already telecommuting.
但一些行业受到重创，一时难以缓过来。
But some industries have been hit hard and are struggling to recover.
首当其冲的是第三产业。
The first is the tertiary sector.
电影、餐饮、旅游文娱、教育培训、金融服务、房地产、体育行业、交通运输业……管中窥豹，经济学家任泽平团队的研究数据显示，仅春节七天，全国电影票房损失70亿，餐饮零售损失5000亿，旅游市场损失5000亿，三者总额超1万亿，占2019年一季度GDP21.8万亿的4.6%。
Cinematography, catering, tourism entertainment, education and training, financial services, real estate, sports, transportation and communications... showed that during the seven days of Spring Festival alone, China lost $7 billion at the box office, $500 billion in catering and retail sales and $500 billion in tourism, totaling more than $1 trillion, or 4.6% of GDP $21.8 trillion in the first quarter of 2019.
庞大的数据背后是无数个具体的个人。
Behind the massive numbers are countless specific individuals.
近日，中国新闻周刊采访了4位受疫情影响，仍然不能复工的普通人。
Recently, China News Weekly interviewed four ordinary people affected by the epidemic who are still unable to return to work.
他们的生活境遇、经济水平、所处行业与地域都不同，但相比起大企业的大悲大喜，他们都有着细碎的烦恼、担忧、庆幸与反思，在生活压力下自我调侃“不能躺着赚钱反而要躺着花钱”。
Their lives, economic levels, industries and territories are different, but they all have their share of worries, worries, self-congratulation, and self-talk under the pressure of life: "You can't lie down and make money."
冯兽兽，北京，培训机构老师刚接到我的直属领导打来的语音电话时，我是很激动的。
Feng Beast, Beijing, Teacher of a training organization I was very excited when I received a phone call from my immediate leader.
今天（3月1日）下午她跟我说要开电话会议，安排日后的工作。
She told me this afternoon (March 1) that she would have a teleconference to plan her work for the future.
我很高兴，哇，终于要复工了！结果等到傍晚6点，她跟我说受疫情影响，北京要求所有教育培训机构线下培训最早在4月底才能开始复工。
I was so happy, wow, I finally got back to work! As a result, at 6 pm, she told me that due to the epidemic, Beijing required all education and training institutions to begin offline training at the earliest by the end of April.
这两个月公司也没有收入，所以期间工资停发，社保也停缴，我的工资发到2月份。
The company had no income for two months, so my salary was suspended, my social security was suspended and my salary was paid until February.
我所在的公司很小，有留学、教育、培训三大块。
My company is very small, there are studying abroad, education, training three large.
我们没有很广的线上渠道，主要做线下培训。
We have no extensive online channels, mainly for offline training.
我是老师，教成人托福、雅思类基础英语。
I am a teacher, teaching adults TOEFL, IELTS basic English.
1月29号，我从洛阳老家来北京。
On January 29th, I came to Beijing from my hometown of Luoyang.
疫情严重，我戴着爸妈给的墨镜、帽子和一次性医用手套，还准备了酒精。
I wore sunglasses, hats and disposable medical gloves from my parents, and prepared alcohol.
当时大家是挤着来的，高铁座位还没排开。
It was crowded and the high-speed rail seats were not yet lined up.
当天上高铁前我还问领导是否推迟上班，她说没收到通知。
Before going on the high-speed train that day, I also asked the leader if the delay in work, she said she did not receive notice.
年初七，我没收到延期复工的通知，就跑去办公室了。
Year 7, I did not receive the extension of the resumption of work notice, ran to the office.
结果没见到有人。
No one was seen.
同楼层另一家培训机构好落寞啊，只有校长一个人在里面。
The other training institution on the same floor is very lonely. Only the headmaster is in it.
领导一直没给我们准确的说法。
The leader never gave us an accurate account.
以后我还扑空过几次，每个周一我都在准备着去上班。
I've flopped a few times since then, and every Monday I was getting ready to go to work.
我回北京一个多月了。
I've been back in Beijing for over a month.
前两周我还做了线上课程，后来线上课渠道合作到期了，就让我做留学咨询以及整资料等很繁琐的工作。
The first two weeks I also did on-line courses, and then the cooperation of the online class channels expired, let me do a study abroad consultation and the whole information and other very tedious work.
这一个多月我就买菜做饭，哪里都不敢去，我就怕哪一天叫我去工作。
This more than a month I buy vegetables to cook, where dare not go, I am afraid to call me to work one day.
冯兽兽2月7日外出买菜时拍下的街景 图/受访者提供我们这个行业，老师们大都在家复工，所有的线下课程变成线上的。
Streetscape from Feb. 7, when Feng Beast was out shopping. / Interviewees offered a view of our industry. Most teachers return to work at home and all the offline courses become online.
但线上课是有限的，线上平台少，供应不足，课程也没法排开。
But online classes are limited, online platforms are few, supplies are inadequate, and courses cannot be scheduled.
所以很多线下课，尤其是一个人几千块课时费的大班课也被取消了。
So a lot of offline classes, especially one where a person spends thousands of hours, have been canceled.
海淀这边有很多像我们这种主攻线下的培训机构。
Haidian there are a lot of training institutions like ours under the main attack line.
领导在电话里跟我说，“你们可以去找工作，我们不怪你，但复工了也欢迎你们回来”。
The leader said to me on the phone, "You can go and look for a job. We don't blame you, but you're welcome back when you get back on the job."
我毫无防备，不敢相信，一时不知所措。
I was defenseless. I couldn't believe it.
她还说有什么困难可以找她，没钱能找你吗？！我之前没有过这种经历，我是去年毕业的，没有什么储蓄。
She also said that there are difficulties to find her, there is no money to find you?! I had no such experience before, I graduated last year, no savings.
在北京生活有高额的费用，一个月房租生活费起码要5000块，更别说在海淀。
Living in Beijing is expensive, with rent of at least 5000 yuan a month, let alone in Haidian.
疫情期间难找工作，也不知道该怎么办。
It was difficult to find work during the epidemic and did not know what to do.
我当时第一反应是该不该和家人讲，我要不要离开北京。
My first reaction was to tell my family if I wanted to leave Beijing.
晚上我妈还给我打电话问我工作怎么样，但我不敢跟我妈说。
My mother called me in the evening to ask how I was doing, but I didn't dare to tell my mother.
我家里人也没有复工，全家都没有收入。
My family has not returned to work, and the family has no income.
邱秋，广东某四线城市，化妆师精神都要崩溃了，想出去又不敢。
Qiu Qiu, Guangdong a certain four-line city, makeup artist spirit is about to collapse, want to go out again dare not.
时间过得太快了，好像还没睡醒又到天黑了。
Time went by so fast that it seemed as if he had not woken up and was dark again.
我现在在家每天吃饱了就睡，有时睡到中午一点才起，起来看手机追剧，无聊了就开始煮饭，再无聊的时候搞卫生，一条缝隙都不放过。
I now eat and sleep at home every day, sometimes sleep until 1: 00 noon to get up, get up to watch the mobile phone drama, boring start cooking, and then boring time to do hygiene, a slot not miss.
没事就抠手指甲，拔开叉的头发，该不该拔的都拔了。
Just scratch your fingernails, pull out your forked hair, and unplug whatever you need to pull.
总是会想出去走走，想工作。
Always want to go out and work.
我们这个行业复工可能要到四五月份，到夏天才行了。
It may not be until April or May, but it will be summer.
从2月开始，我周围没有一个化妆师上班了。
I haven't had a makeup artist around since February.
这半年都没法挣钱，反而还要花钱。
I can't make money these six months, but I have to spend money.
今天晚上我去超市买了一些零食、鸡蛋、牛奶还有几个火龙果，花了我一百五十块大洋，钱不耐用啊。
I went to the supermarket this evening to buy some snacks, eggs, milk and some dragon fruit. It cost me 150 dollars.
之前过年是很忙的。
The Spring Festival before is very busy.
一二月份是旺季，因为节日比较多，还有情人节。
January and February are busy because there are many festivals and Valentine's Day.
我之前工作的美甲店在步行街，一直到晚上10点才统一关门，年三十、初一初二都要上班。
The manicure shop I used to work in was on Pedestrian Street and didn't close until 10 p. m., so I had to work on the second day of the year.
有多少个客人？那就数不清咯，单是做指甲我一个人每天要做10个左右，有的款式复杂要做2小时左右。
How many guests are there? I just have to do 10 or so nails a day. Some styles are complicated and take about 2 hours to do.
去年11月开始，我和一个星级酒店合作，给酒店的二三十个沐足技师化妆。
Since November last year, I have been working with a star hotel, putting on the makeup of 20 or 30 of the hotel's body mechanics.
每天只需要去4个小时，剩下的时间我去之前的美甲店兼职，也去影楼、工作室，还给淘宝平面模特化妆。
Only four hours a day, the rest of the time I go to the nail shop part-time, also go to the studio, studio, and Taobao flat model makeup.
但受疫情影响，年三十酒店就空了一半人左右。

我加的化妆群，到现在没有一个需求，叫人帮忙啊顶班啊都没有，一个都没有。
I add make-up group, there is no need to call for help ah, ah, no shift, no one.
我工作10年，做化妆师4年，没放过这么长的假。
I've been a makeup artist for 10 years and I haven't let this long vacation go away.
幸好我老公还在上班，要不然就吃老本了。
Luckily, my husband is still at work, otherwise he will eat his hat.
本来打算今年要存下钱的，之前有过这两年生小孩的想法，生完小孩后可以开一家自己的店。
I was going to save money this year. I had the idea of having a baby in two years, and I could open my own shop after having a baby.
但现在也说不定。
But maybe right now.
我也喜欢干这个，就等复工吧。
I like this, too. Let's get back to work.
夏昊燕，上海，餐馆老板我比较乐观。
Haoyan, Shanghai, restaurant owner I am more optimistic.
我做餐饮13年了，在很多地方待过，但以前都是给别人做。
I've been dining out for 13 years. I've been in a lot of places, but I used to do it for others.
现在我在上海市奉贤区南桥镇开了一家小餐馆，主营馄饨，和沙县小吃差不多。
Now I have opened a small restaurant in Fengxian District of Shanghai, the main wonton, and Shaxian snacks about the same.
店不大，只有30平方（米）。

目前除了我们两个老板还有一个店员。

我自己也是收银员、厨师，还是外卖员。
I myself am a cashier, a cook, or a take-out.
年底骑手少，近的话就自己送了。
There were few riders at the end of the year.
有时候无聊也送别人家的外卖，赚外快。
Sometimes boredom also gives away other people's take-out, earning extra money.
店里早上5点半开门，到第二天凌晨3点多才关门。
The store opened at 5: 30 in the morning and didn't close until after 3 a.m. the next morning.
我们3个人轮着来，早去的早走。
It's our turn to leave early.
但我不觉得累，都是手上的活，为自己做，有冲劲。
But I do not feel tired, are the hands of work, for themselves to do, there is momentum.
最累的时候就是没生意的时候。
The most exhausting time is when there is no business.
每年下半年是旺季，尤其是放暑假的时候。
The second half of the year is busy, especially during summer holidays.
年初是淡季，尤其赶上疫情，现在是零收入，但租金、电费都要出。
The beginning of the year is a slow season, especially in the wake of the epidemic, now zero income, but rent, electricity are all to be paid.
房租一年6万，5月份交今年的房租，不知道能否降一点。
The rent is 60,000 a year. I don't know if I can reduce it a little.
我们正常是初八开工的。
We started work on the eighth day of school.
我年初四就从老家来到浙江这边一个朋友家，原本打算玩三天，但没想到疫情严重，困在了这里。

什么时候复工也不确定，到了上海还要居家隔离14天。

我估计三月下旬才能营业，到时也只能做外卖，不让吃堂食，估计会比以往收入下降9成。
I don't expect to be able to open until late March, so I'll have to take it out and not eat it.
我相信肯定会有点外卖的，自己做好防控就行。

我提前网购了好多重新营业要用的东西，最近快递都到了。

Zhang Feng, Xi'an, Shaanxi. The tour guides I know are all closed.
旅游业每年冬天属于淡季，我1月只接了一个活。
Tourism is a slack season every winter. I only get one job in January.
旅行社的老板损失会更大一点，他们有销售、财务等，得养着。
Travel agency owners will lose a little more, they have sales, finance, etc., have to support.
对我而言最大的影响是我胖了10斤，还没钱。
The biggest impact on me is that I've put on ten pounds and I haven't got any money.
朋友圈里很多人在做微商，还有些老导游在抖音做直播。
Many people in the circle of friends are doing micro-business, and some old guides are shaking live.
我房租是正常交的，房东人很好，住进去几年都没涨过房租。
My rent is due normally, the landlord is very good, has not increased the rent in a few years.
可惜我错过了西安买房的黄金期，因为一直在纠结，毕竟房贷压力大。
Unfortunately, I missed the prime time of buying a house in Xi'an, because has been tangled, after all, mortgage pressure.
我们工种特殊，拿钱是现结的。

像我这种今天赚了300块，我要花200到250块的人，攒的是小头。
Now that I'm making 300 bucks today, I'm spending 200 to 250 dollars on small savings.
更别说很多90后、00后是月光族。
Not to mention many after 90, after 00 is the moonlight clan.
但疫情对整个旅游业的影响是巨大的。
But the impact of the epidemic on tourism as a whole is enormous.
有新闻报道说本次疫情对旅游行业的影响最为严重，全国旅游业预计今年损失接近3万亿元。
News reports say the epidemic is having the most serious impact on tourism, which is expected to lose nearly 3 trillion yuan this year.
这不算夸张，可能最终的数字比这还大。
This is not an exaggeration. The final figure may be even higher.
旅游行业属于第三产业，有吃、住、行、游、购、娱六大要素，要解决的就业范围是很广的。
The tourism industry belongs to the tertiary industry. It has six major factors: eating, living, travelling, traveling, buying and entertaining.
今年“二月二”当天的西安大唐不夜城 图/陕西省文化和旅游厅官网腊月二十八，我们团队就取消了。
On February 2 this year, Xi'an Dayang Nighttime City Map / Shaanxi Culture and Tourism Department official website 28, our team cancelled.
我们正常是过年不放假，高峰期在初二到初六之间，每天都会很忙，基本不会闲下来。
We normally do not have holidays, peak between the second day of junior high school, every day will be very busy, basically will not idle.
有一天我早上7点就带客人出门，到晚上12点才回家。
One day I took my guests out at seven in the morning and didn't come home until twelve at night.
过年旅游人多，前年大年初四左右，我收工后晚上打了辆出租回家，师傅听我说的是陕西话，跟我说“你是这几天我拉的唯一一个本地人”。
The year before last, about four years ago, I took a taxi home after the end of the night, master listen to me is Shaanxi language, told me "you are the only local people I pull these days."

今年到现在还没营业。
It hasn't been open so far this year.
对家里肯定是有影响的，突然间没有收入了。
It must have had an effect on the family. Suddenly there was no income.
旅行社目前的坐班人员已经上班了，但导游没游客去干嘛呢。
The travel agency's current staff is already at work, but the tour guide has no tourists to do.
我们行业全国大面积复工的话得到下半年，比如你平时爱去的某家饭店确诊了一例，但后续没有报道了，我就问你，你还敢去吗？况且疫情过后大家收入减少，谁还愿意出去呢？西安的景点目前好些都没开。
In the second half of the year, if you go back to work in a large area of the industry, such as a hotel you like to go to, but no follow-up report, I ask you, do you still dare to go? Besides, after the epidemic has reduced income, who would like to go out? Xi'an scenic spots have not been many.
我主要带省内游，其中一半游客是研学旅行的家庭游。
I mainly take provincial tours, half of which are home tours for study tours.
正常上课期间，开学，期末，3月，11月，家长会请年假带着娃逛，属于课程的一部分。
During the normal school period, the beginning of the school year, the end of March, November, parents will be invited to take the annual leave to roam, part of the curriculum.
但学生到现在都没开学，娃的家长也受影响，还能像之前那么大方拿钱带娃出门吗？ 即使恢复正常了，我对西安旅游业也有担忧。
But the students have not yet started school, baby's parents are also affected, as before can take the money to take her out of the door? Even if normal, I have concerns about Xi'an tourism.
大雁塔外面都没有大巴车停车场，西安市路上划了禁停标志，小酒店门口没法停车。
Big wild goose pagoda outside there is no bus parking lot, Xi'an City Road marked a stop sign, small hotel entrance can not stop.
光是对旅游车停车这件事上，市上和省上文件都不同。
City and provincial documents are different when it comes to car parking alone.
在这样的背景下，不知道西安旅游受疫情冲击后会怎么样。
In this context, I do not know what will happen to Xi'an tourism after the impact of the epidemic.
家里人目前建议我改行，但我想再看看。
My family is advising me to change my profession now, but I'd like to see it again.
