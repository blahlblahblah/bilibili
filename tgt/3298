澎湃新闻记者 温潇潇 发自武汉71岁的武汉人袁林桂感觉自己正在慢慢复原。
Yuan Lingui, a 71-year-old Wuhan journalist, felt he was slowly recovering.
就在短短一个月前，医生们曾一度认为她希望渺茫。
Just a month ago, doctors once thought she had no hope.
医生陈爱兰回忆，老人2月初住院时，血氧饱和度只有76%（注：呼吸循环重要参数，正常人高于95%），甚至一度低至50%，她形容为“情况要命”。
Chen, a doctor, recalls that when the elderly were hospitalized in early February, the oxygen saturation of the blood was only 76 percent, or as low as 50 percent, she said.
陈爱兰来自广州医科大学附属第一医院，是广东首批援汉医疗队医疗组组长，她所在的广东医疗队对口援助武汉汉口医院，袁林桂是粤鄂两地专家医护联合负责的病人之一。
Ailan Chen, from Guangzhou Medical University First Affiliated Hospital, is the first medical team leader of Guangdong Medical Team to assist Hankou Hospital in Wuhan, Guangdong Province. Yuan Lingui is one of the patients under the joint medical and medical care of Guangdong Province.
发病后，袁林桂曾感觉“全身酸软无力、皮肤粗糙，小腿到脚都是僵硬的，除了能喝水，就是废人一个”。
Yuan Lin-gui once felt "the whole body weak, rough skin, calves to feet are rigid, in addition to drinking water, is a waste of people."
如今，她可以告诉医生，自己洗头洗澡不再需要有人帮忙，用吸管在水杯里做呼吸训练也可以坚持得更久了。
Now she can tell her doctor that she doesn't need any help washing herself, and that breathing exercises in a water glass with a straw can last longer.
不过，她仍面临部分难题，比如无法完全脱氧、无力咀嚼，以及上厕所难以下蹲等。
However, she still faces some problems, such as not being able to fully deoxidize, being unable to chew, and having trouble squatting in the toilet.
无论如何，在所有危重症抢救案例中，袁林桂属于最令人振奋的成功案例之一，并作为典型发布在钟南山团队领衔的微信公众号上。
In any case, Yuan Lingui was one of the most exciting success stories of all critical care cases and was featured on the microphone public sign led by the Zhong Nan Shan team.
陈爱兰介绍，早在2月下旬，老人便从危重症转为重症，且核酸两次检测均为阴性，只是目前肺部功能仍未恢复，需要继续接受康复治疗。
Chen said that in late February, the elderly from critical to severe, and both tests negative nucleic acid, but lung function has not yet recovered, the need to continue rehabilitation treatment.
袁林桂庆幸自己没有彻底放弃。
Yuan is glad he hasn't given up completely.
尤其当她看到儿子通宵达旦地照顾和鼓励自己：“如果不是他这么坚定，我连命都没有了，就放弃了。
Especially when she saw her son nursing and encouraging himself all night long: "If he hadn't been so determined, I wouldn't have given up.
”曾两度想放弃袁林桂现在回想，认为“这个病太快了，一点商量的余地都没有”。
Yuan, who twice wanted to give up, now thinks "the disease is too fast for consultation."
1月26日（大年初二）晚上，她感觉肠胃不舒服，开始上吐下泻，浑身发冷，出现低热。
January 26 (New Year's Day) evening, she felt gastrointestinal discomfort, began to vomit diarrhea, chills, low fever.
尽管当时没人知道她是否感染了新冠病毒，家人还是谨慎起见，腾出一间房给她单住。
Although no one knew at the time if she had the new crown virus, the family took care to vacate a room for her to live alone.
那时是武汉因新冠肺炎疫情封城的第四天，大医院人满为患，无明显肺炎症状的人群被建议居家隔离。
It was the fourth day since Wuhan was shut down by the outbreak of pneumonia in the capital. Large hospitals were overcrowded and people with no apparent pneumonia symptoms were advised to stay at home.
没人知道应该如何应对，袁林桂服用了家里年前跟风抢购的连花清瘟、奥司他韦，大家都希望只是虚惊一场。
No one knows what to do about it. Yuan Lin-gui took Lianhua rinderpest and oseltamivir, which had been snapped up by the wind a few years ago.
但隔离才第三天（1月29日），袁林桂在家走几步就要停下来喘气，皮肤颜色开始变深，“就像涂了酱油一样”，她开始心慌，担心死在家里。
But after only the third day of isolation (Jan. 29), Yuan stopped for a few steps to catch her breath and her skin began to get darker. "It was like wearing soy sauce," she began to panic and worry about dying at home.
儿子高峻立即带着袁林桂去社区卫生服务中心，对方劝他赶紧去医院拍CT。
Son Gao Chun immediately took Yuan Lin Gui to the community health service center, the other side urged him to go to the hospital for CT.
当天CT结果显示：双肺感染。
CT showed that there were two lung infections.
在首批收治新冠肺炎的定点医疗机构武汉汉口医院里，高峻惊呆了：医院挤满了人，输液大厅里也摆着人们自带的各式躺椅，上面全是人。
At Wuhan Hankou Hospital, the first designated medical facility to treat pneumonia, Gao was stunned: the hospital was crowded with people, and the infusion hall was filled with people carrying their own lounge chairs, all filled with people.
袁林桂开始在输液大厅打吊针。
Yuan Lin Gui began to inject fluid hall to hammer a needle.
但她觉得越打越没精神，只能喝水，什么都吃不下去。
But she felt that she was losing her spirit and could only drink water and eat nothing.
她回忆当时的感觉：“很热很难受，就像被丢进了烤烧饼的炉子里，肌肉全部松弛了，脚也不能动。
"It was hot and uncomfortable," she recalls, "like being thrown into a baking pan with flabby muscles and no movement of the feet.
我觉得我‘中枪’了。
I think I was shot.
”她记得，很多人为了求床位到处哭，跪着的、站着的、坐着的、睡着的，到处是人。
"She remembered that many people cried everywhere for beds, on their knees, standing, sitting, asleep, and everywhere.
2月2日，输液的第三天，袁林桂进了抢救室。
On February 2, the third day of the infusion, Yuan Lin Gui entered the rescue room.
她爬上抢救室走廊里不知道谁留下的一张躺椅，感觉自己再也起不来了。
She climbed into a deck chair in the emergency room hallway and didn't know who had left it. She felt like she would never get up again.
那时，医生刚为袁林桂争取到一只氧气瓶，高峻一步都不敢走开：“一个氧气瓶恨不得十几个人来抢。
At that time, doctors had just won Yuan Lin-gui an oxygen cylinder, a step too steep to walk away: "An oxygen cylinder would like a dozen people to rob it.
”抢救室的场景一度让袁林桂心理崩溃。
Yuan Lin-gui was devastated by the rescue room scene.
高峻回忆，至少“她前后左右的都走了”。
Gao Qiu recollects, at least "she all left and right".
入夜后，袁林桂开始出现幻觉，她看到面前有一座火焰山，脚下是红色的河流。
Yuan Lin-gui began to hallucinate that there was a mountain of fire in front of her and a red river at her feet.
醒来后，她担心脑子烧坏了，翻来覆去地想。
When she woke up, she thought over and over, worried that her brain would burn.
她在手机里编好遗书，一一发给家人们。
She wrote suicide notes on her cell phone and handed them out to her family.
高峻收到后不知如何回应，他也差点崩溃，但转念一想，崩溃了又能怎么办？2月6日前后，汉口医院部分轻型和普通型病人转院治疗，空出一部分床位，袁林桂终于在住院病区分到了一张病床。
When Gao received the report, he almost collapsed, but on second thought, what could he do if he collapsed? Around February 6, some light and ordinary patients in Hankou Hospital were transferred to hospital for treatment, leaving some beds free.
这意味着，袁林桂终于可以得到系统的治疗和照顾，但她却再次想放弃。
That means Yuan is finally getting systematic treatment and care, but she wants to give up again.
在她看来，距离发病已经过去了近半个月，全身酸软的感觉还很强烈，吃饭时筷子拿不起来，身体像火一样烤，小腿到脚都是僵硬的，全身皮肤跟枯树一样粗糙。
In her view, nearly half a month after the onset of the disease, the whole body is still very strong feeling, eating chopsticks can not take up, the body like fire roast, calves to feet are stiff, the whole skin is as rough as dead trees.
除了能喝水，她觉得自己是“废人一个”。
In addition to being able to drink water, she felt like a total wreck.
无绝对标准可循的治疗方案陈爱兰初次接触袁林桂，是后者从抢救室转入住院病区后。
There is no absolute standard of treatment program Chen Erlang first contact Yuan Lin Gui, the latter from the rescue room into the inpatient area.
袁林桂病情突然加重，吸空气时的血氧饱和度仅为76%，而正常人的数值通常可以达到95%以上。
Yuan Lin Kui suddenly became seriously ill, absorbing the oxygen saturation of the blood only 76%, normal people can usually reach more than 95%.
广东首批援汉医疗队专家陈爱兰、郭亚兵、谢佳星，以及汉口医院本院医生乐文卿、徐莹、余浩经过协商讨论后，决定对她采用相对大剂量的激素冲击疗法，而且超过了诊疗方案的推荐剂量。
After consultation and discussion with Chen Ailan, Guo Yaping and Xie Jia Xing, the first medical team specialists from Guangdong Province, and doctors from Hankou Hospital, Le Wenqing, Xu Ying and Yu Hao, decided to use a relatively large dose of hormone wallop therapy to her, exceeding the recommended dose of the programme.
这是一个大胆的决定。
This is a bold decision.
陈爱兰介绍，使用激素最主要是为了降低人体炎症反应，让人从急性期缓过来：“就像小孩子走路一样，你刚开始牵一把，等他走稳了再放手。
Chen Erlan said the main reason for using hormones is to reduce the body's inflammatory response, so that people recover from the acute phase: "Just like a child walking, you just start to pull, until he is stable before letting go.
”但如果判断不准确，造成使用时机或者时长不对，便可能出现继发细菌感染、血糖升高、股骨头坏死等不良状况。
But if the judgment is inaccurate and the timing or length of use is wrong, a secondary bacterial infection, elevated blood sugar and necrosis of the femoral head may occur.
几位参与讨论的专家回想起当时的场景，庆幸抓住了使用激素的最佳时机。
Several discussants recalled the scene and were glad to have seized the best moment to use the hormone.
陈爱兰清楚记得袁林桂的肺部CT：“她的两肺都是白的，磨砂玻璃一样，炎症渗出非常明显、非常严重。
"Both her lungs are white, and like polished glass, the inflammation is very clear and serious," Chen clearly remembers Yuan's lung.
专家组评估后决定加大剂量，否则会错失治疗的最佳时机。
The panel assessed and decided to increase the dose or risk missing out on the best opportunity for treatment.
”汉口医院医生徐莹是袁林桂的主治医师。
Xu Ying, a doctor at Hankou Hospital, is Yuan's attending physician.
她回忆，袁林桂那时几乎讲不了话，“病情太危重了”，专家组也曾犹豫过是否使用相对大剂量的激素，但最终还是决定“搏一搏”。
Yuan, who was barely able to speak at the time, "was too ill," she recalls, and the panel hesitated to use a relatively large dose of hormones, but decided to "fight it out."
根据当时试行的第五版诊疗方案，危重症病例建议酌情在3-5天内使用激素，剂量建议不超过相当于甲泼尼龙1-2mg/kg/日，否则容易延缓对冠状病毒的清除作用。
Under the then pilot version 5 protocol, it was recommended that in critical cases, hormones should be used within 3-5 days, as appropriate, with doses not exceeding the equivalent of 1-2 mg / kg / d of methylprednylon, which would have delayed the removal of coronavirus.
也就是说，如果严格按照指南执行，袁林桂的激素使用量每天应不超过100mg。
That is, Yuan should not use more than 100 mg of the hormone per day if strictly followed the guidelines.
专家组最终根据袁林桂的实际情况，将剂量增加至每天160mg，连续使用两天后减为80mg，并逐步减量到20mg，前后使用激素约十天。
The expert group eventually increased the dose to 160 mg / day, reduced it to 80 mg / day after two consecutive days and gradually reduced it to 20 mg / day, using the hormone for about 10 days.
有了这样的经历，陈爱兰深感救治新冠肺炎危重症患者目前仍无普遍标准可循：“全国专家只能总结出一个比较规范的诊疗方案，但这只是大致原则。
With this experience, Chen felt that there was still no universal standard for treating patients with severe acute coronary pneumonia: "National experts can only generalize a more standardized approach to diagnosis and treatment, but only in broad terms."
做医生没这么简单，如果根据指南就能把病看好，就不叫新冠肺炎，而是普通肺炎了。
Being a doctor is not that simple. If you can see the disease according to the guidelines, it is not called New Crown Pneumonia, but ordinary pneumonia.
”袁林桂的治疗过程最终被作为典型案例，在钟南山团队领衔的微信公众号“南山呼吸”上进行总结探讨。
Yuan Lin-gui's treatment process was eventually taken as a typical case, and was summarized and discussed on the "Nanshan Breathing", a microcosm led by the Zhong Nan Shan team.
总结文章指出，除激素冲击治疗以外，由于袁林桂呼吸费力，普通鼻导管吸氧难以满足其需要，她还曾于住院早期接受了经鼻高流量氧疗，吸入氧浓度为60%，流量从40L/min逐渐提高至70L/min，并接受了用来抗炎的头孢哌酮钠舒巴坦钠，用来抗病毒的利巴韦林以及其他支持治疗。
In addition to hormonal shock therapy, Yuan Lin Kui had difficulty breathing enough to satisfy her needs. She had received transnasal hyperflux oxygen therapy early in the hospital, inhalation of oxygen at 60%, flow from 40 L / min to 70 L / min, and administration of cefoperazone sodium sulbactam for anti-inflammatory ribavirin and other supportive treatments.
令徐莹印象深刻的是，陈爱兰曾建议她使用较大剂量的呼吸道祛痰药，以及黏液溶解药氨溴索。
Xu Ying was impressed that Chen had advised her to use larger doses of respiratory expectorant, as well as the mucus-soluble drug ambroxol.
这项建议基于广州呼吸健康研究院的发现——新冠肺炎患者的小气道会形成明显的痰栓。
The proposal is based on findings by the Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health that the small airways of patients with Newcomial Pneumonia can form significant sputum bolts.
结果，住院治疗一周多后，袁林桂咳出一大口痰，让医护人员惊喜不已。
As a result, more than a week after hospitalization, Yuan Linggui coughed up a mouthful of sputum, which surprised the medical staff.
因为新冠肺炎病人的主要症状之一是干咳，能够排痰说明肺部功能正在改善。
Because one of the main symptoms of new crown pneumonia patients is dry cough, the ability to sputum indicates that lung function is improving.
2月16日起，医院给袁林桂增加了中药巩固治疗。
From February 16, the hospital added traditional Chinese medicine to Yuan Lingui consolidation treatment.
2月17日，袁林桂的症状和各项实验室检查明显好转，经鼻高流量氧疗也改为氧流量更低的储氧面罩，吸氧时血氧饱和度为98%。
On February 17, Yuan Lin Kui's symptoms and laboratory tests improved significantly, and the oxygen therapy through the nose was changed to oxygen storage mask with lower oxygen flow.
20日、22日两次复查新冠病毒核酸均为阴性。
Nucleic acid (Nucleic Acid) was negative in both cases on June 20 and 22.
“每一个病例都是综合治疗，治疗措施有十几种，每个患者治疗方案都不完全一样。
"Every case is a combination of treatment, there are a dozen treatment measures, each patient treatment program is not exactly the same.
”陈爱兰强调。
Chen Eilan stressed.
在她看来，袁林桂治疗成功的关键，还在于全程的精神支持。
In her view, Yuan Lingui treatment success key, also lies in the entire process spiritual support.
精神支持最易被忽视袁林桂刚住院时，曾拒绝一切治疗措施，情绪一波动，耗氧量就“蹭蹭”往上涨。
Yuan Lin Guigang most neglected when hospitalized, has rejected all treatment measures, mood swings, oxygen consumption "dawdle" upward.
高峻还在不断鼓励她，他们已经“从地狱到天堂了，一定要坚持，一定会好”。
Gao continued to encourage her, they have "from hell to heaven, must insist, will be good."
事实上，高峻在那前后刚被医生叫到办公室，被告知妈妈CT情况不好，“要随时做好心理准备”。
In fact, Gao Jun was summoned to the office by a doctor shortly before and after that, and told that his mother had a bad CT condition.
走出医生办公室，他找来一张躺椅，紧挨着放在袁林桂床边。
Out of the doctor's office, he found a deck chair, next to the bed of Yuan Lingui.
医护人员劝他离开病房，或者尽量待在病房走廊里，他也不肯。
The paramedics advised him to leave the ward or try to stay in the hallway of the ward, but he refused.
“我怕万一她走了，亲人不在身边，心里会有遗憾的。
"I am afraid that if she should go, her relatives will not be around, the heart will be sorry.
”高峻握着妈妈的手，其实袁林桂当时已处于几乎昏迷的状态，难以作出任何回应，但他希望妈妈别怕。
"Mr. Gao shook his mother's hand, but Yuan Lin-gui was in a state of near coma, making it difficult to respond, but he hoped her mother wouldn't be afraid.
尽管希望渺茫，高峻仍愿意相信哪怕一线希望。
Desperate though he may be, Gao is willing to believe even a glimmer of hope.
因为他的眼前时不时会浮现出母子二人在抢救室的场景：“40多岁的，60多岁的，胖的、瘦的、高的、矮的、男的女的都有，有自己放弃的，有家人放弃的，也有安慰方式不对的。
For now and then he saw the scene of the mother and the child in the emergency room: "In their 40s, in their sixties, fat, thin, tall, short, male and female, some giving up on their own, some giving up by family members, and some not
”他亲眼看到，有些家属见病人不配合，情急之下企图用言语“激”对方。
He saw with his own eyes that some family members were trying to "provoke" each other with words when they saw that their patients were uncooperative.
但平时无关紧要的善意提醒，此时却瞬间能让病人心理崩溃：“一旦崩溃就很明显，很快，很快。
But an unimportant reminder of good intentions can break a patient's mind momentarily: "Once a crash is obvious, quickly, quickly."
”于是，他想出各种办法开导妈妈：讲笑话，看家人照片，跟家人视频，和她一起畅想出院后的生活计划，鼓励她多吃东西。
"So he came up with various ways to teach his mother: tell jokes, see pictures of her family, video of her family, share with her plans for life after she left the hospital, and encourage her to eat more.
他还经常留意其他病人，如果别人情况有所改善，就会立即成为他鼓舞妈妈的典型案例。
He also kept an eye on other patients, and if someone else's situation improved, it would be a case in point.
碰上妈妈抗拒治疗，他便像哄小孩一样说：“如果今天打了没效果，咱们就不打了，先试试看。
When his mother resisted treatment, he said like a child: "If it doesn't work today, let's just give it a try.
”陪护时间漫长而单调，高峻却一直闲不下来。
The company was long and monotonous, and high and steep.
照顾妈妈之余，他不停地刷手机看新闻，试图总结救治经验。
In addition to taking care of his mother, he kept brushing the phone to see the news, trying to summarize the experience of treatment.
“看来看去都没有特效药，医生也拿它没办法，关键要提高病人的免疫力。
"There is no specific drug to look at, doctors can not do with it, the key is to improve the immunity of patients.
”他特别注意妈妈要不要喝水、吃东西。
He paid special attention to his mother's desire for water and food.
但袁林桂难受的时候，根本吞不进东西，喉咙里满满的。
But Yuan Lin-gui afflictive time, cannot swallow a thing at all, throat is full.
他听说注射白蛋白、丙球蛋白可以提高人体免疫力，他也去买回来。
He heard that injecting albumin and propionin boosts immunity, and he bought it back.
袁林桂眼看着儿子全天24小时护理不愿离开医院，等体力恢复一些，便开始逼自己生活自理。
Yuan Lingui watched her son 24 hours a day care not to leave the hospital, wait for a bit of physical recovery, then began to force their own life.
她假装大口吃饭，硬撑着去打水、上厕所：“我担心他感染怎么办，后来我发现，我怎么把自己也骗了，我真的可以（自理）了。
She pretended to be eating big meals, forcing herself to fetch water and go to the toilet: "I was worried about his infection, and then I found out how I had fooled myself and I really could.
”“与患者的心理沟通是最不能忽略的，有时比吃药更重要。
"" Psychological communication with patients is one of the most important things, sometimes more important than taking medicine.
”陈爱兰说。
'she said.
从医近二十年，她发现心理干预在所有治疗阶段最容易被忽视，却有着不可替代的能量。
From nearly two decades of medical treatment, she found that psychological intervention is the most neglected in all stages of treatment, but has irreplaceable energy.
徐莹也会叮嘱其他医护人员多鼓励袁林桂：“要从小细节说，避免总是谈病好不好得了。
Xu Ying will also tell other medical staff to encourage Yuan Lingui: "To say small details, to avoid always talking about illness is good.
”于是，医护人员们最常挂在嘴边的话是：把牛奶当水喝，吃好、睡好、心情好，病就好得快。
"So what the doctors and nurses said most often was, Drink milk for water, eat well, sleep well, be in a good mood, and get well soon.
高峻记得，一名戴眼镜的男医生曾跟妈妈开玩笑，鼓励她努力康复，否则他为她“抢”来的高科技氧疗机就白费了。
Gao remembers a bespectacled male doctor who joked with his mother to encourage her to make a recovery effort, otherwise the hi-tech oxygen therapy machine he "grabbed" for her would have been wasted.
还有不知道多少次，医生们拉着妈妈的手，哪怕几句话都是满满的鼓励。
Also do not know how many times, the doctors take mother's hand, even a few words are full of encouragement.
最近，袁林桂听说广东队可能逐步撤回，躲进厕所悄悄哭了一场。
Recently, Yuan Lingui heard that Guangdong team may gradually withdraw, hiding in the toilet quietly crying.
3月5日，她向来查房的陈爱兰展示，自己用吸管在水杯里做呼吸训练，一口气可以坚持8秒了。
On March 5, she showed Chen Eilan, who was visiting the house, that she could practice breathing in a glass of water with a straw for eight seconds.
不过，她还面临部分难题，比如无法完全脱氧、无力咀嚼、上厕所难以下蹲，需要继续接受康复治疗。
However, she faces a number of challenges, such as inability to fully deoxidize, inability to chew, difficulty in crouching in the toilet, and the need for continued rehabilitation.
但她心上的大石终于落下了——儿子自2月22日离开医院被集中隔离，核酸检测均为阴性，尚未出现任何症状。
But the big rock in her heart had finally fallen - her son had left the hospital on February 22 and was concentrated in isolation, with negative nucleic acid tests and no symptoms.
高峻曾以为，母亲和自己都很难全身而退，却没想到最终母子都成为了命运的宠儿。
Gao Xun once thought that mother and himself are very difficult to escape, but did not expect that in the end, mother and child have become the favorite of fate.
3月8日，高峻完成十四天隔离回到家中，与久违的妻儿团聚。
On March 8, Gao returned home from 14 days of isolation and reunited with his long-lost wife and children.
他最想分享给所有重症、危重症的患者和家属：“千万别放弃。
He wants to share it with all his critically ill and critically ill patients and family members: "Never give up.
