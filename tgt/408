31.01.2020: 1420 words: 1420, reading for about 2 minutes: Hospitals are still in short supply of protective materials, especially in general practice rooms.
作者 | 第一财经吴绵强“最近科室有确诊（新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎）的病例了，我们才开始穿防护服。
"We started wearing protective clothing only recently when the department had a confirmed case of coronavirus-infected pneumonia.
”1月30日下午，刚下班的协和医院某科室护士刘雪（化名）在电话那头告诉记者，他们医院的防护物资已经非常紧缺。
On the afternoon of January 30, Liu Xue (not his real name), a nurse from a concorde hospital who had just left work, told reporters on the phone that the hospital's protective equipment was already in short supply.
当天，协和医院医生通过互联网对外发布求助信息称，该院医疗物资即将全部用尽，现紧急请求社会支援，列明：急需防护服3000件、医用N95口罩5000个、医用外科口罩8000个、一次性隔离衣3000件、防护面罩1000个，“这些数目仅为参考，实际上是越多越好。
A doctor at Concorde Hospital said on the Internet that the hospital was running out of medical supplies and was urgently seeking social support for 3,000 items of protective clothing, 5,000 medical N95 masks, 8,000 medical surgical masks, 3,000 disposable protective clothing and 1,000 face masks.
”刘雪是一位已经工作8年的护士，此次疫情发生后，她抛下家中几个月大的孩子，坚持在医院上班。
Liu, a nurse who has worked for eight years, stuck to her job at the hospital after the outbreak, leaving her baby a few months old.
为了做好隔离，刘雪下班后不敢回家，只能入住院外的酒店。
In order to do a good job isolation, Liu Xue after work dare not go home, can only enter the hotel outside the hospital.
刘雪告诉记者，医院现在依然是防护物资紧缺，“院方的需求公告经常对外发布，一般捐赠物资到了医院之后，院方就会通知各科室医护人员前去领取。
Liu told reporters that hospitals are still in short supply of protective materials, "the hospital's needs are often announced to the public, the general donation of materials to the hospital, the hospital will notify the departments and medical staff to collect.
但往往到来的防护物资是优先给发热门诊和隔离病房，毕竟他们才是真正的‘一线战场’。
But often the arrival of protective equipment is given priority to the fever clinic and isolation ward, after all they are the real 'front-line battlefield'.
”“其实普通病房比隔离病房更危险，因为‘敌人’在明处，我们科室是‘敌人’在暗处，只有查出来了才能得知。
"The common ward is more dangerous than the isolation ward, because the 'enemy' is in the light, our department is in the dark, and only if we find out can we know.
本来我们科室的病人很容易发烧，因此无法简单判断到底是哪种发烧。
The patients in our department are feverish, so it is not easy to tell which kind of fever it is.
”她的话告诉记者，普通病房医护人员同样面临被感染新型肺炎的危险，而由于物资紧缺，这些普通科室医护人员在防护物资的配发上却只能排到后面。
Medical staff in general wards are also at risk of contracting the new type of pneumonia, and because of shortages, they are left behind in the distribution of protective equipment, she told reporters.
“说实话，之前都没有穿防护服，只是最近出现了确诊的病例，大家才安排穿上。
"To be honest, no protective clothing has been worn before, only recently has there been a confirmed case and people are putting it on.
”刘雪声音开始低沉。
Liu's voice began to murmur.
“现在大家还是比较担心，有些密切接触的同事都已被隔离，无法前来上班。
"There is still some concern that some of the colleagues who are in close contact are isolated and unable to come to work.
我今天有点咳嗽，去医院拍了CT，所幸检查结果肺部‘还好’，应该没有问题。
I had a cough today and went to the hospital for a CT scan, but luckily it turned out the lungs were 'okay' and there should be no problem.
一旦有问题的话，当时就会被隔离起来。
If there was a problem, it would have been isolated.
”事实上，到目前已经有普通科室医务人员被确诊感染新型肺炎的病例。
In fact, so far there have been cases of new pneumonia diagnosed among medical staff in general departments.
刘雪还说，“有些防护服很薄，半透明的那种，一看就没有用。
"Some suits are thin and translucent," Liu said. "They're useless at first sight.
我想大家都是好心，但是一看就不专业，质量也是参差不齐。
I think everyone is kind, but at a glance it is not professional, the quality is also uneven.
包括那种护目镜，别人捐赠给我们的是一些滑雪用的护目镜，前两天连这个也没有，我们主任医师戴着游泳镜查房，病人还拿这个开起了玩笑。
Including the kind of goggles, we were given some ski goggles, the last two days did not even have this, our chief doctor wearing a swimming mirror to check room, patients also joke about this.
病房里面的医护人员护目镜是各种颜色，白的、黄的、红的，各种颜色都有。
The medical personnel goggles in the ward are all kinds of colors, white, yellow, red, all kinds of colors.
”缘何质量不达标的防护用品会流向医院？一位医院工作的知情人士告诉记者，防护物资对于院方来说，本来就很紧缺，并且在目前的稀缺状态下，估计院方工作人员也来不及审核。
A hospital source familiar with the matter told reporters that protective materials were already scarce for the hospital and that it was too late for hospital staff to review them.
“现在有总比没有强呀，只能凑合着用。
"It's better now than nothing. We can only get along.
”刘雪说。
'said Liu.
实际上，协和医院对此次捐赠的防护物资提出了要求。
In fact, Concorde made a request for the donated protective material.
据该院发布的公告称，“捐赠的物资须符合国家临床医用标准或进口标准，否则医护人员将无法使用。
"Donations must meet national clinical standards or import standards, or medical personnel will not be able to use them," the hospital said in a statement.
”其中，部分物资须符合或高于以下标准：中国医用防护口罩：GB19083-2010；N95口罩：美国NIOSH认证，非油性颗粒物过滤效率≥95%；欧洲N95口罩：欧洲FFP2标准；KN95口罩：中国GB 2626 强制性标准，非油性颗粒物过滤效率≥95%；外科口罩：YY 0469-2011（医用外科口罩）；防护服 ：GB19082-2009《医用一次性防护服技术要求》、二级以上医用防护服（一般衣服上有红蓝条纹）；护目镜：二级以上医用护目镜 - Medical Safety Googles / Protective Eyewear，“有捐赠物资需院感部门审核后才可发送给临床使用。
Some of these items must meet or exceed the following standards: Chinese Medical Mask: GB19083-2010; N95 Mask: NIOSH US Accreditation, Non-oily Particulate Filtration Efficiency > 95%; European N95 Mask: European FFP2 Standard; KN95 Mask: Medical Safety Gloves / Protective Eyear.
”刘雪说，防护物资紧缺的情况不只是发生在她所在的病室、医院，不少分布在武汉市内不同医院的同学、同行都与她说到了类似的问题。
Liu said the shortage of protective materials was not confined to her sickroom and hospital, and many of her classmates and colleagues at different hospitals in Wuhan had similar problems with her.
她的这一描述，与网上流传的各种医院防护物资紧缺信息相近。
Her description is similar to information circulating on the Internet about the shortage of protective materials for hospitals.
1月30日晚，在湖北省召开的新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情防控工作新闻发布会上，湖北副省长曹广晶回应了医疗物资的分配问题，称将全力以赴组织省内的企业复工、复产，相关企业24小时不停产。
On the night of January 30, Cao Guangjing, vice-governor of Hubei province, responded to the distribution of medical supplies by holding a press conference on the prevention and control of pneumonia related to a new coronavirus infection.
他预计，在未来两三天内，湖北可以达到两万套左右防护服的生产水平。
He predicted that in the next two to three days, Hubei will be able to reach the production level of about 20,000 protective clothing.
