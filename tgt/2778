3 月 3 日，《国家科学评论》（NSR）发表题为《关于 SARS-CoV-2 的起源和持续进化》研究称，新冠病毒已经演化出 L 和 S 两个亚型，并且这两种亚型的传播能力、致病严重程度或许存在明显区别。
On March 3, the National Scientific Review (NSR) published a study entitled "Origin and Continuing Evolution of SARS-CoV-2," which states that the new crown virus has evolved into two subtypes, L and S, and that there may be significant differences in the transmission capacity and severity of the two subtypes.
研究发布后，媒体纷纷以 “新冠病毒已突变为 2 个亚型” 等字眼报道，似乎新冠病毒已经突变产生了新的威胁。
After the study was published, the media reported that the new crown virus had mutated into two subtypes, as if the virus had mutated to create a new threat.
事实上，病毒突变符合正常流行病学规律，目前研究也没有发现病毒产生重组，那么就不应该引起人们无端恐慌。
In fact, the virus mutation is in line with normal epidemiological law, and current research has found no recombination of the virus, then people should not cause unwarranted panic.
《国家科学评论》发表的这项研究是一个针对基因分型的研究，并没有确证新冠病毒产生了功能的分型，对其传染力和毒性的比较也只是猜测。
The study, published in the National Science Review, is a genotyping study that does not confirm the functional classification of the new crown virus, and comparisons of its infectivity and toxicity are speculative.
DeepTech 经多方了解发现，对于一个 3 万碱基对大小的 RNA 病毒来说，数月来的大规模传播过程中累积产生 149 个突变并非意外。
DeepTech has found that for a 30,000-base-to-size RNA virus, the accumulation of 149 mutations over months of large-scale transmission is not surprising.
相反，业内认为新冠病毒还是比较稳定的。
On the contrary, the industry believes that the new crown virus is still relatively stable.
新冠病毒并没有质的突变突变对于病毒来说是“家常便饭”，尤其是对于新冠病毒这类 RNA 病毒更是如此。
The new cap virus has no mutant mutations that are common to viruses, especially RNA viruses such as the new crown virus.
新冠病毒在宿主中快速复制、传播过程中，随机突变（即拷贝 RNA 时的错误）会在基因组中累积。
Stochastic mutations (errors in copying RNA) accumulate in the genome as the new crown virus rapidly replicates and spreads through its host.
这种随机突变可以帮助追踪病原体的传播，并了解其传播途径和动态。
Such random mutations can help track the spread of pathogens and understand their pathways and dynamics.
《国家科学评论》论文的通讯作者系北京大学生命科学学院生物信息中心陆剑研究员与中国科学院上海巴斯德研究所崔杰研究员。
The author of the National Scientific Review paper is Lu Jie, a researcher at the Biosciences Information Center of Beijing University and Cui Jie, a researcher at the Pasteur Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
他们分析了公共数据库里的 103 个新冠病毒基因组数据，发现这些病毒株一共存在 149 个突变位点，且多数突变在近期发生。
They analyzed 103 new crown virus genome data from public databases and found 149 mutations in these strains, most of which occurred recently.
研究人员依据病毒 RNA 基因组的第 28144 位点将这些基因组数据分为 2 个组，L 亚型是 T 碱基（对应亮氨酸，Leu），S 亚型是 C 碱基（对应丝氨酸，Ser）。
The researchers divided the genome data into two groups, L-bases (corresponding to leucine, Leu) and S subtypes, C-bases (corresponding to serine, Ser), according to the viral RNA genome at 28144.
并得出 S 亚型新冠病毒与蝙蝠来源的冠状病毒在进化树上更接近，即 S 亚型相对更古老的结论。
It is concluded that the S-subcrown virus is closer to the bat-derived coronavirus in the evolutionary tree, that is, the S subtype is older.
作者表示，相对于 S 亚型，L 亚型更具毒性，传染力更强。
The authors suggest that the L subtype is more toxic and infectious than the S subtype.
论文称，这个推断将有助于新冠肺炎的差异化的治疗和防控。
This inference, the paper said, would be helpful for the differential treatment and prevention of new crown pneumonia.
复旦大学生命科学学院姜宁博士告诉 DeepTech，这个研究只是针对基因组上的突变分型，要说 2 个亚型在功能上有区别的话，至少现在是证据不足的，还需要进一步的功能验证。
Dr Jiang Ning, of Fudan University's School of Life Sciences, told DeepTech that the study only looked at mutations in genomes, and that if there were functional differences between the two subtypes, it would require further functional validation, at least for the time being.
因为这种区别是很多原因造成的，单纯从目前的证据得不出 2 个亚型传染力强弱区分的结论。
Because there are many reasons for this difference, it is impossible to conclude from the present evidence that there are two subtypes of infectious disease.
对于新冠病毒这类 RNA 病毒来说，最需要关注的特性就是传染力和毒性，目前还没有看到两者发生了质的突变。
In the case of RNA viruses such as Newcap virus, the most noticeable characteristics are infectious and toxic, and no qualitative mutations have been seen.
姜宁表示，2 个亚型的比较只是一个猜测，需要实验来验证，要知道生物信息学的分析都需要实验来验证。
Jiang Ning said the comparison of the two subtypes is a guess and needs to be tested experimentally, and that bioinformatics analysis needs to be validated experimentally.
但是这个推测是有意义的，应该引起注意或者引起重视。
But this assumption is significant and should be noted or drawn attention to.
论文显示，从武汉分离出的 27 种病毒中，有 26 种（96.3％）为 L 亚型，只有 1 种（3.7％）为 S 亚型。
The paper showed that of the 27 viruses isolated from Wuhan, 26 (96.3 per cent) were L subtypes and only 1 (3.7 per cent) was S subtype.
但是，在武汉以外地区分离出的其他 73 种病毒中，L 亚型为 45 种（61.6％），S 亚型为 28 种（38.4％）。
However, of the 73 other viruses isolated outside Wuhan, 45 (61.6 per cent) were L subtypes and 28 (38.4 per cent) were subtypes S.
L 亚型在武汉暴发的早期阶段更为普遍，作为祖先型的 S 亚型几乎完全被 L 亚型取代，而 L 亚型的发生频率在 2020 年 1 月初后有所下降，随着时间推移，S 亚型又逐渐上升。
L-subtypes were more common in the early stages of the Wuhan outbreak, with the progenitor S subtype almost completely replaced by the L subtype, while the frequency of occurrence of the L subtype decreased after the beginning of January 2020, and the S subtype gradually increased over time.
作者认为，人为干预可能对 L 亚型施加了更大的选择性压力，使其传染能力更强，复制速度更快。
In the authors' view, human intervention may exert greater selective pressure on L subtypes, making them more contagious and replicating faster.
另一方面，随着医疗和隔离措施的加强，L 亚型的负选择压力变大，S 亚型选择压力变弱，所以 S 亚型频率逐渐上升。
On the other hand, with the strengthening of medical treatment and isolation measures, the negative selection pressure of L subtype becomes larger and that of S subtype becomes weaker, so the S subtype frequency increases gradually.
对于病毒不同亚型与其致病性的关系，作者表示本可通过把基因组数据和病例结合起来分析，从而加强证据等级。
With regard to the relationship between different subtypes of viruses and their pathogenicity, the authors suggest that evidence could have been enhanced by combining genomic data with case analysis.
但由于无法得到患者资料，也就无法得到更多基因组数据。
Without access to patient data, however, additional genomic data are not available.

据 DeepTech 了解，中国科学院西双版纳热带植物园郁文彬等人的论文（下称 ChinaXiv 论文）正在同行评议中。
According to DeepTech, a paper by Yu Wenbin and others from Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is undergoing peer review.
ChinaXiv 论文和《国家科学评论》论文有相似之处。
There are similarities between the ChinaXiv paper and the National Science Review paper.
其一，都是依据目前公开的新冠病毒基因组数据库。
First, they are based on the currently publicly available Genomic Database on the New Crown Virus.
只是前者用了 93 份样本，后者用了 103 份样本。
The former used only 93 samples, while the latter used 103 samples.
其二，都对基因组样本进行了基因分型。
Second, both genome samples were genotyped.
前者关注的是新冠病毒的传播特性，分为 ABCDE 等 5 个组；后者依据突变位点将样本分为 2 个组。
The former focused on the transmission characteristics of the new crown virus, divided into five groups such as ABCDE; the latter divided the samples into two groups based on mutation loci.
有学者指出，两个研究在确定古老基因型的方法和数据上差别不大，差异在于研究的目标。
Scholars have pointed out that the two studies differ little in the methods and data used to identify ancient genotypes, with differences in the objectives of the studies.
ChinaXiv 论文的硬伤在于将新冠病毒溯源作为目标之一，而目前武汉新冠病毒样本的缺陷很容易导致结论偏倚。
The hard part of the ChinaXiv paper is that it traces the new crown virus to its source as one of its targets, and the current defects in Wuhan's new crown virus samples can easily lead to biased conclusions.
因为最大疫情暴发地的武汉病毒样本数据太少，而确诊病例少得多的其他国家和省份却数据更多。
Because Wuhan virus samples are too few at the site of the largest outbreak, more data are available in other countries and provinces where the number of confirmed cases is much lower.
而《国家科学评论》论文并没有将新冠病毒溯源作为研究目标，这就让它避免了有关样本缺陷导致的批评。
The National Scientific Review did not trace the new crown virus to its source, which allowed it to avoid criticism over sample defects.
在《国家科学评论》论文中提到，2020 年 1 月 7 日之前分离出的 26 个样本全部来自武汉，而 2020 年 1 月 7 日以来收集的 74 个样本中，只有一个来自武汉，33 个来自中国其他地方，40 个来自中国以外的患者。
According to the National Scientific Review, all 26 samples separated before January 7, 2020 came from Wuhan, while of the 74 samples collected since January 7, 2020, only one came from Wuhan, 33 from other parts of China and 40 from outside China.
值得注意的是，这里的样本只有100个，是因为有2个样本不符合两个亚型分类而未计入，另有一个患者的样本同时具备L和S两个亚型。
It is worth noting that there are only 100 samples here because two samples did not meet the two subcategories and were not counted, and one patient had both L and S subtypes in the sample.
这与 ChinaXiv 论文的样本分析接近。
This is close to the sample analysis of the ChinaXiv paper.
《国家科学评论》论文作者也表示，103 个病毒株基因组数据量较少，后续工作需要扩大样本量，以验证这些结论或推测。
The authors of the National Scientific Review also indicated that the genomic data of 103 virus strains were low and that follow-up work would need to expand the sample size to validate these conclusions or speculations.
有学者指出，ChinaXiv 论文和《国家科学评论》论文用的分析方法是传统的植物系统进化和分类研究方法，或者是基因组比较大的样本研究，而这些研究的基因组大小和新冠病毒不是一个等级的。
Scholars have pointed out that the analytical methods used in the ChinaXiv and National Scientific Review papers are traditional methods of plant system evolution and taxonomy, or genome-wide sample studies where genomic size is not the same as that of the new crown virus.
这样的话，“这个进化分析结果的稳健性是值得进一步分析确认的”。
In this case, "the robustness of this evolutionary analysis is worth further analysis."
