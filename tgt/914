Under the influence of epidemic situation and Spring Festival, it is very difficult for labor workers to dispatch, and the logistics of living materials, dining arrangements, accommodation and resettlement are also under great pressure.
施工场地东西高差最大近10米，既有建筑物需要拆除，又有大量清淤工作和鱼塘回填任务；运力紧张、低温冻雨、道路不通……摆在建设者面前的难题，一道接一道。
Construction site east-west height difference of up to 10 meters, the existing buildings need to be dismantled, there is a large number of dredging work and fish pond backfilling tasks; capacity constraints, cold rain, impassable roads...
在火神山，一切节点都是以小时、甚至分钟计算的。
In Mount Fire, all nodes are counted in hours, even minutes.
极限的工期要求下，设计、施工、监理人员齐守现场，整个建设过程可以总结为“边设计、边施工、边修改、边调整”。
The construction process can be summed up as "side design, side construction, side modification and side adjustment."
5000万网友通过直播“在线监工”，见证了火神山的建设速度：1月25日，在设计图纸尚不确定的情况下，建设者们不等不靠，提前进场施工。

对于在原有医院基础上改建的“小汤山医院”项目来说，工期更短，基本要求在2-3天内改造完成。
In the case of the "Xiaotangshan Hospital" project, which was rebuilt on the basis of the original hospital, the construction period was shorter and the basic requirements were completed within 2-3 days.
“27、28、29日就3天，必须完成1.41万平方米的改造修缮。
"On the 27th, 28th and 29th days alone, 14,100 square meters of renovation must be completed.
”这是长沙决定改造修缮长沙市公共卫生救治中心（长沙第一医院北院），收治长沙及周边所有的确诊病人时，提出的时间要求。
"This is Changsha's decision to renovate and renovate the Changsha City Public Health Treatment Center (Changsha First Hospital, North Hospital) and to treat all confirmed patients in and around Changsha.
接受媒体采访时，负责施工的湖南高岭建设集团董事长胡锷说，当时他的心里很没底，“大年初二怕是难找到人。
Interviewed with the media, Hunan Gao Ling Construction Group in charge of the construction of Hu Ngok said that at that time his heart was very bottomless, "even the second year is difficult to find people.
”出乎他意料的是，1月27日一大早，58名工友争相赶来，“没有一个人讲条件，我们就是吃这碗饭的，我们不建医院，有病大家去哪治？”一位工友说。
To his surprise, on the early morning of January 27, 58 workmates rushed in, "None of us made the conditions, we just ate this bowl of rice, we didn't build the hospital and everybody went for it?" said one of his workmates.
当天下午，工人队伍又增加到近200人，还有工友不顾家人反对偷偷过来。

2003年“非典”时期，为有效控制疫情，北京在7天内建成小汤山定点医院，创下世界医院修建速度纪录。
During the SARS period in 2003, in order to effectively control the epidemic, Beijing established the Xiaotangshan Ding Hospital within 7 days, setting a world record for the speed of hospital construction.
医院两个月收治全国七分之一的“非典”患者，医务人员未发生一例院内感染。
Hospitals treated one in seven SARS patients in two months, and there was no hospital infection.
当时的北京小汤山医院基本为一层病房，共有22个病区，1000张床位。
At that time, the Xiaotangshan Hospital in Beijing was basically a one-floor ward with 22 sick areas and 1,000 beds.

The north side of ward is intensive care unit, reception room, examination department.
曾参与北京小汤山医院设计的知名设计师黄锡璆，得知武汉将参考“小汤山模式”建设医院后，专门给设计团队打去电话。
Once participated in the design of the Beijing Xiaotangshan Hospital famous designer Huang Xi, learned that Wuhan will refer to "Xiaotangshan model" to build hospitals, dedicated to the design team to call.
他提出，当年的小汤山医院设计曾留下遗憾和不足，比如病房紧挨地面，没有隔空层，容易潮湿；没有设置专用病区走道，开门就是院子，管理不便。
He pointed out that the design of Xiaotangshan Hospital in the past left regret and deficiency, such as the ward close to the ground, no isolation layer, easy to damp; no dedicated area walkway, the door is the yard, inconvenient management.
“我们在设计时充分听取了这些宝贵的意见和建议。
"We have fully listened to these valuable comments and suggestions in our design.
”中信建筑设计研究总院有限公司副总建筑师、火神山医院设计总负责人汤群在接受媒体采访时说。
"Tang Qun, deputy chief architect at CITIC Architecture Research Institute Limited and chief design officer of Mount Fukuyama Hospital, said in an interview with reporters.
在北京小汤山医院的设计基础上，火神山医院共设两栋住院楼，呈中间医护两边病房的“鱼骨状”布局，站在走道里可步行至任何一间病房。
Based on the design of the Xiaotangshan Hospital in Beijing, the hospital has two in-patient buildings with a "fishbone-like" arrangement of the wards on both sides of the hospital in the middle. They can walk in the aisles to any ward.
病房离地面架空30厘米，每间病房放置两张病床，均有独立卫生间。
The ward is 30 cm above the ground, with two beds in each ward and separate bathrooms.
两扇窗户和通道组成的专用隔离防护窗，用于药品和食品的传递。
A special isolation window consisting of two windows and passageways for the delivery of medicine and food.
而且医院绝大部分房间都是负压房间。
And most of the rooms in the hospital are negative pressure rooms.
“房间内的压力比外面低，如同给病房戴上‘口罩’，避免病毒随着气流产生交叉感染。
"Pressure in the room is lower than outside, like wearing a 'mask' on the ward to avoid cross-infection with the air flow.
”相关负责人介绍。
About the person in charge.
医院实行严格的分区隔离，不仅医疗区与生活区分开，还设置清洁区、半污染区、污染区及医护人员专用通道和病人专用通道，严格避免交叉感染。
Hospitals are strictly zoned, not only separating medical areas from living quarters, but also setting up clean-up areas, semi-polluted areas, polluted areas and special passages for medical personnel and patients so as to strictly avoid cross-infection.
为杜绝大气和水污染，医院铺设了5万平米的防渗膜，覆盖整个院区，同时搭设了雨水、污水处理系统，经过两次氯气消毒处理，达标后才可排入市政管网；每间病房均分别单独设置不可循环的新风系统和排风系统，它们共同构成负压系统，保持病房空气新鲜洁净，排出气体经消毒后才会排入空气中；在1号病房楼南侧设垃圾焚烧炉，固体废物集中焚毁，确保不造成环境污染。
To eliminate air and water pollution, the hospital has laid 50,000 square metres of impermeable film covering the entire compound, and installed a rainwater and sewage treatment system that can only be discharged into the municipal network after two chlorine disinfection treatments. Together they form a negative pressure system that keeps the air fresh and clean in the ward and disinfects the gas before discharging into the air.
“很多设计标准、设备配备，都要优于当年的小汤山‘非典’专科医院。
"A lot of design standards, equipment and equipment, are superior to that of the" SARS "specialist hospital in Xiaotangshan.
”原北京小汤山“非典”医院院长张雁灵表示，火神山医院建成并投入使用，将对防控疫情产生重大意义。
Zhang Yanling, the former director of the SARS hospital in Beijing's Xiaotangshan, said the construction and commissioning of the hospital would be of great significance to the prevention and control of the epidemic.

中建三局供图━━━━━湖北改建临时传染病医院将有章可循有了北京小汤山医院的经验，如今落地全国各地的应急传染病医院，都对不同区域的隔离划分提出了严格要求。
2007-9-24 16: 48 The reconstruction of temporary infectious disease hospitals in Hubei will follow the experience of Xiaotangshan Hospital in Beijing, and now hospitals for emergency infectious diseases all over the country have set strict requirements for the separation of different regions.
郑州版“小汤山医院”设计为病房住院区、接诊观察区、医技综合区，三大功能区相对独立，以门禁相互隔离。
Zhengzhou version of "Xiaotangshan Hospital" is designed for ward inpatient area, acceptance observation area and medical technology comprehensive area.
病患流线、医护流线、污物流线、后勤流线四线分离且清晰便捷，确保“洁污分流、医患分流”。
Patients with streamline, medical streamline, sewage streamline, logistics streamline four lines separation and clear and convenient, to ensure "pollution diversion, doctor-patient diversion."
孝感新建的安陆市传染病医院，规划面积100亩，分为生活区域、物资供应区域和急救区域三部分，同时设有病人通道、医护人员通道、清洁物品通道和医疗废物通道。
The newly built Hospital for Infectious Diseases in Anlu City has a planned area of 100 mu and is divided into three parts: living area, material supply area and first aid area.
功能区域划分为何如此严格？相关负责人表示，这既能有效抗击当下疫情，长远来看，也能提升全市医疗卫生水平。
Why is the division of functional areas so strict? The officials said it would not only effectively combat the current epidemic, but also improve the city's health care in the long run.
但真正建设一所规范的传染病医院，并非易事。
But it will not be easy to build a properly regulated hospital for infectious diseases.
时间紧、任务重、技术人员缺乏，建设或改造临时医院没有现成的设计规范，都是建设路上的“拦路虎”。
Time constraints, heavy tasks, lack of technical personnel, the construction or renovation of temporary hospitals do not have ready-made design norms, are on the construction road "blocking the road."
为此，湖北省住建部门近日紧急组织编制《呼吸类临时传染病医院设计导则（试行）》。
For this reason, the housing department of Hubei Province has recently organized an emergency compilation of "Guidelines for the Design of Hospitals for Respiratory Temporary Infections (Trial)."
《导则》提出，在临时传染病医院的总体规划和平面布局上，明确功能分区，做到各部门洁污分区与分流。
The Guidelines propose that functional zoning should be defined in the overall planning and layout of temporary infectious disease hospitals so as to achieve clean-up zoning and diversion among departments.
合理设计诊疗流程，重视医疗区内病患者诊疗活动区域与医务工作人员工作区域的相对独立。
Reasonable design of diagnosis and treatment process, pay attention to the medical patients in the area of diagnosis and treatment activities and medical staff work area relative independence.
减少洁净与污染人流、物流的相互交叉与相互感染几率。
Reduce clean and polluted stream of people, logistics of the intersection and mutual infection rate.
同时要“临时兼顾长远”，统筹考虑短期使用和长期使用在建筑功能、安全等方面的规范要求，为发展预留一定的空间，布局与竖向以及结构应考虑改扩建的可能性。
At the same time, we should take into consideration the short-term use and long-term use in terms of building functions and safety. We need to reserve space for development.
记者注意到，《导则》还首次详细披露了武汉火神山医院和雷神山医院的设计方案和平面图，供湖北各地建设临时医院参考。
Reporters noted that the Guidelines also disclose, for the first time in detail, the designs and plans of Wuhan Fosen Mountain Hospital and Lei Shenshan Hospital for reference in building temporary hospitals throughout Hubei Province.
并给出箱式房和活动板房两种自由度高、安装和拆卸方便的钢结构装配式建筑体系选型。
The paper also presents the selection of steel structure assembling system with high degree of freedom and convenient installation and disassembly in box and movable slab room.
此前，鄂州版“小汤山医院”——雷山医院的建设，便参考火神山医院、雷神山医院的设计，结合当地实际需要，对包括呼叫系统、监控系统、消防系统等在内的场地进行了设计规划。
Earlier, Huizhou version of the "Xiaotangshan Hospital" - Lei Shan Hospital, the construction of the reference fire god mountain hospital, Lei Shenshan Hospital design, taking into account the actual needs of the local needs, including the call system, monitoring system, fire protection system and other sites for design planning.
据中国建设报报道，为有效缓解病房不足患者较多的突出矛盾，湖北省各地计划启动120多所临时传染病医院或隔离病房建设、改造。
According to China Construction News, more than 120 temporary hospitals or isolation wards for infectious diseases are planned to be built or renovated throughout Hubei province to effectively alleviate the acute shortage of patients in the wards.
据悉，上述《导则》适用于新建临时性按甲类传染病预防和控制的医院建筑，能够有效指导湖北临时传染病医院的建设或改造工作。
It is reported that the above-mentioned Guidelines are applicable to the construction of new temporary hospital buildings for the prevention and control of Class A infectious diseases and can effectively guide the construction or renovation of the Hubei Temporary Infectious Disease Hospital.
这意味着，今后，湖北各地临时传染病医院的建设和改造将有章可循。
This means that in the future, the construction and renovation of temporary infectious disease hospitals throughout Hubei will be regulated.
