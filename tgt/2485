"The vicious competition in the visa industry has been the main reason why 100 percent can't hold fast, and the outbreak of the new crown virus has accelerated the process and led to funding problems," she said.
”2月29日上午，一张百程旅行网的文件截图在网络流传，文件截图显示，百程旅游宣布关闭公司启动清算准备。
On the morning of Feb. 29, a screenshot of a 100-way travel website circulated over the Internet, and a screenshot of the documents showed the company closing down to begin liquidation.
百程旅游或是第一家因行业受到疫情打击而关门清算的中等规模旅游企业。
The tour is the first medium-sized tour company to close down after the industry was hit by the epidemic.
截图显示，在2020年第005号文件中，百程旅游表示，“鉴于新冠病毒疫情的爆发，旅游业受到了前所未有的打击，全行业处于停顿状态。
According to the screenshot, in document 005 of 2020, EMI said: "Tourism has been hit harder than ever by the outbreak of the new crown virus and the industry is at a standstill."
百程也深受影响，资金不能维系公司继续运转。
PepsiCo has also been deeply affected by the lack of capital to keep the company afloat.
为此，公司召开了股东大会，管理层做了汇报，股东会决定关闭公司并启动清算准备。
To this end, the company held a general meeting of shareholders, management reported, shareholders will decide to close the company and start liquidation preparations.
”就此事，百程旅游官方尚未发布回应，但界面新闻向接近百程旅游的知情人士确认属实。
No response has yet been received from EMI officials, but Interface News confirmed it to people close to the company.
百程旅游全名为北京百程国际旅游股份有限公司，主要经营出境旅行在线零售，以代办签证服务为主业，并曾将业务延伸至目的地旅游服务，总部设立在北京，并在上海、广州、深圳、成都、沈阳、武汉设立六个分公司。
The company is mainly engaged in online retail for outbound travel, mainly engaged in handling visa services, and has extended its business to destination tourism services, headquartered in Beijing, with six branches in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chengdu, Shenyang and Wuhan.
官网介绍显示，截至2015年百程旅游已累计服务近200万人次。
Up to 2015, 100% of the total travel services have reached 2 million people, according to the website.
2016年4月，百程旅游正式挂牌新三板。
In April 2016, 100% of the tourism official new three-board listing.
2019年6月消息，百程旅游等数家旅游企业从新三板退市摘牌。
June 2019 news, travel and other tourism enterprises from the new Sanbao de-listing.
上述知情人士表示，新三板退市的原因和公司的战略考虑相关，“因为新三板对中小企业的资金加持没有太大帮助，每年还有很高的管理费用。
The people familiar with the matter said the reasons for the new board's exit were linked to the company's strategic considerations, "because the new three-panel approach does not help small and medium-sized enterprises financially and carries high administrative costs every year.
”至于此次百程旅游关门清算，他分析认为，2016年后互联网流量红利逐步退潮，旅游业资本市场热钱减少，签证行业的恶性竞争，是导致百程无法坚持的主要原因，而新冠病毒疫情的爆发加速了这一进程，直接导致资金出现问题。
As for the closure of the 100-way travel business, he argues that the gradual erosion of Internet traffic dividends after 2016, the decline in hot money in tourism capital markets and vicious competition in the visa industry are the main reasons why 100 per cent cannot be sustained, a process that has been accelerated by the outbreak of the new crown virus, leading directly to funding problems.
从外部原因来看，淘宝、飞猪等平台上的中小签证商户的激烈竞争影响到百程的主营业务。
From the external reasons, Taobao, Pig and other platforms on the small and medium-sized visa business on the impact of the fierce competition 100% business.
“签证行业门槛很低，在旅游零售平台上，签证商户为了赚快钱，利用低价获客，进行流量圈存，导致行业恶性竞争，譬如恶性刷单的现象在平台上也屡见不鲜，这对百程这样的正规企业造成冲击。
"Visa industry barriers are very low, in order to earn quick money, access to low-cost customers, traffic ring, leading to vicious competition in the industry, such as the phenomenon of malicious billing on the platform, this impact on a formal enterprise like 100%.
”上述知情人士称，在2019年年中，百程旅游在淘宝、飞猪等线上流量入口的流量规模出现减少趋势，从线上平台获得流量的能力减弱，而企业本身唤醒老用户力度也不够强。
People familiar with the matter said that in mid-2019, there was a downward trend in the volume of traffic entering the online traffic entrances to Taobao and Pigs, with less ability to get traffic from online platforms and less effort by companies themselves to woo old users.
或许也是因此，百程在过去几年加大了对目的地业务的投入。
Perhaps as a result, PepsiCo has increased its investment in destination operations over the past few years.
2016年上半年，百程签证业务在营收中占比为60.9%，目的地业务占比17.99%；2017年上半年，百程目的地业务同比增长117.60%，在收入结构中占比提升至40.18%；2018年上半年，百程签证业务占比45.94%，目的地业务占比45.25%。
In the first half of 2016, 100% of revenue and 17.99% of destination business; in the first half of 2017, 100% year-on-year growth and 40.18% in revenue structure; and in the first half of 2018, 45.94% of 100% were for 100% and 45.25% for destination.
财报显示，2017年度和2018年半年报，百程旅游的净亏损都在收窄。
Financial results show that 2017 and 2018 semi-annual reports, 100% travel net loss is narrowing.
2018年半年报显示，百程旅游净亏损1285.64万元，同比亏损减少了552.73万元，营业收入2.84亿元，同比增长22.86%。
The 2018 semi-annual report showed a net loss of $12,856,400, a year-on-year loss of $5,527,300 and revenue of $284 million, an increase of 22.86 per cent.
同时百程旅游当期毛利率水平为10.18%，较上年同期下降了1.11个百分点。
Meanwhile, the current gross profit margin of 100% tourism is 10.18%, down 1.11% from the same period last year.
然而，目的地业务虽然给百程旅游带来了不少营收，但以贷款为主要方式在目的地业务上的投入，给百程旅游的资金问题埋下了隐患。
However, although the destination business has brought a lot of revenue, but the main way of loans in the destination business investment, to Baicheng tourism funds planted hidden dangers.
“公司发现，签证和目的地业务同时开展的模式，使得我们能覆盖人工成本，给员工发放奖金，实现了账目上的盈余，但实际上财务端没有向业务端同步资金进入目的地业务的成本，比如贷款利息的核算。
"The company found that the simultaneous pattern of visa and destination operations enabled us to cover labour costs, give bonuses to employees and achieve a surplus in the accounts, but in practice the financial side did not synchronize the costs of moving funds to the business end into the destination business, such as accounting for interest on loans."
”上述信源表示。
"said the source.
百程旅游本身没有足够现金投入目的地旅游商品的采购，通过融资、贷款进入目的地业务的运作，而目的地旅游产品销售是一项需要较大现金流投入的业务。
Encyclopaedia itself does not have enough cash to invest in the purchase of destination tourism goods, through financing, loans into the operation of destination business, and destination tourism product sales is a large cash flow input business.
比如采购门票产品，需要一次达到一定规模的采购数量，才能获得该项产品的市场较低价，以此出售获得利润。
For example, the purchase of ticket products requires a certain size of procurement at a time in order to obtain a lower price in the market for the product, thereby making a profit on the sale.
而旅游产品的利润本身微博，有的产品毛利率甚至低于贷款利率。
And the profits of tourism products themselves Weibo, some products even lower gross margin than the loan rate.
“于是在2018年下半年，公司逐步压缩目的地内容，在2019年4月份全部砍掉。
"So in the second half of 2018, the company is scaling back its content and cutting it all by April 2019."
”上述信源称。
"said the source.
再加上2018年、2019年旅游行业创业公司本身较难融钱，百程旅游已经感到不易。
Coupled with 2018, 2019 travel industry start-up companies themselves more difficult to finance, 100% travel has not been easy.
天眼查数据显示，百程旅游2008年A轮融资1000万美元，投资方包括斯道资本（原富达亚洲），银瑞达Investor AB等，2011年获得泰山天使投资A+轮，2014年获阿里巴巴、CBC宽带资本2000万美元B轮投资，2015年获得来自湖畔山南资本、飞猪资本等2亿元人民币投资和瑞元资本战略融资。
In 2008, Zenith Travel received $10 million in A-round financing, including Si Tao Capital (formerly Fidelity Asia), Silver Rita Investor AB and others, won A + round investment in 2011, Alibaba, CBC Broadband Capital B round investment of $20 million in 2014, Lakeside Shannan Capital, Pig Capital, etc. in 2015.
据上述信源称，百程旅游在此后仍有过未公布的融资，主要来自个人。
According to the source, EMI has since had unannounced funding, mainly from individuals.
令人预测不到的是，在原本出境旅游旺季的春节，新冠病毒疫情导致国内旅游业停摆，出境旅游团暂停，并且近日以来疫情在全球其他国家也出现逐渐严重的趋势，对旅游企业造成直接冲击。
Unexpectedly, during the Spring Festival, which was the peak season for outbound travel, the outbreak of the new crown virus led to a halt in domestic tourism, the suspension of outbound tours and, in recent days, a gradual increase in the number of cases in other countries, with a direct impact on tourism enterprises.
“关门清算也不一定是个坏事，”上述信源最后评价称，“相信老曾（百程旅游创始人、董事长曾松）不是个认输的人。
"Closing the door isn't necessarily a bad thing," the source said in its final comments. "I don't believe Lao Zeng, founder and chairman of EMI, is a loser.
现在还有时间和精力，最起码有个好的身体去面对，以后还能重新开始。
Now there is time and energy, at least have a good body to face, later can start again.
