口述实录 | 为武汉医护送免费午餐的“上海模子”：不忍她们吃泡面，我把鲍鱼也用上了……。

编者按《口述实录 | 快递小哥搞定金银潭医护难题：我送的不是快递，是救命的人啊！》一文在网上引发关注后，热心读者纷纷给周刊提供线索。
The editor at Ritual & amp; Express took care of the health care problem: I wasn't a express delivery, it was a lifesaver. "After the story caught attention online, eager readers gave the weekly clues.
其中，一篇发表于宽带山论坛的帖子引起了我们的注意。
One of them, a post published in the Broadband Mountain Forum, caught our attention.
和快递小哥一样，来自上海的“80后”餐馆老板同样用自己的方式在武汉抗疫一线传递着爱心。
Like courier brother, "80 after" restaurant owners from Shanghai also used their own way in the first line of Wuhan anti-epidemic to convey love.
昨天（2月16日），在周刊读者、宽带山网友华东政法大学陈波老师的帮助下，记者辗转联系到了帖子的作者，即本篇故事的口述人朱仁。
Yesterday (Feb. 16), in the weekly reader, broadband Internet users Huadong University of Political Science and Law Chen Bo's help, the reporter contact the post's author, namely the oral person of this story Zhu Ren.
接受采访时，他刚刚完成了当天的送餐工作。
At the time of the interview, he had just finished his meal delivery for the day.
口述 |朱　仁整理 | 应　琛我不知道当初辞职离开上海，到武汉创业的选择对不对，但是这段时间的经历，我觉得自己做了人生中非常正确的一个选择。
I didn't know whether my choice to leave Shanghai and start a business in Wuhan was the right one, but I felt I had made the right choice at the time.
当我老了之后，我想仍是可以拿出来说道说道的。
When I get old, I think I can still come up with it and say it.
不是说，我做了多少贡献，至少我给7岁的女儿树立了一个好的榜样。
Not that I have contributed much, at least I have set a good example for my seven-year-old daughter.
朱仁昨晚收到的订餐信息，订餐数还在不断增加每天23点左右，我嫂子就会陆陆续续将第二天医院的订餐信息发给我和厨房的同事。
When Zhu Ren received the order information last night, the number of meals ordered continued to increase around 23: 00 pm daily, my sister-in-law would gradually send me and my kitchen colleague a message about the next day's hospital orders.
我一般会先数一数订餐量，心里有个底。
I usually count the number of meals, I have a bottom in mind.
但因为有些医护人员是半夜回到酒店后才开始订餐，早上起来也有会些订单，所以只要时间允许，我们都会随时加单。
But because some of the paramedics don't start ordering until after they get back to the hotel in the middle of the night, there are also orders in the morning, so we can always order more whenever time permits.
现在算起来，从1月26日开始，我们为医护人员免费提供午餐已经持续了三个星期。
Now, starting on January 26, we've been offering free lunches to paramedics for three weeks.
01老婆的老板让她立刻下车回上海我今年36岁，是个土生土长的上海人，之前在上海某百年企业旗下的一家香精香料厂上班。
01 My wife's boss told her to get off and return to Shanghai at once. I am 36 years old, a native of Shanghai, and worked in a perfume factory run by a 100-year-old company in Shanghai.
有一个表哥在武汉做生意好多年了，其中包括餐饮。
A cousin has been doing business in Wuhan for many years, including catering.
每年春节，表哥一家人都会回上海和我们一起过。
Every Spring Festival, my cousins return to Shanghai to spend time with us.
席间，也听他提起过日后又拓展店铺的计划。
During the dinner, he also heard about his plans to expand the shop in the future.
去年春节，我带着家人去武汉旅游，看到了武汉发展变化之快，也去表哥店里吃了饭。
Last Spring Festival, I took my family on a trip to Wuhan, saw the rapid development of Wuhan change, also went to cousin's shop to eat dinner.
回来后，我就在想，我今后的人生轨迹是不是可以有些新的变化。
When I came back, I wondered if I could make any new changes in my life.
就这样，2019年7月，我辞职来到武汉跟着表哥一起开新店。
So, in July 2019, I resigned and went to Wuhan to open a new shop with my cousin.
表哥当时已经有两家店，一家日式自助餐和一家韩式烤肉。
My cousin already had two shops, a Japanese buffet and a Korean barbecue.
他计划再新开两家。
He plans to open two more.
我来了之后，他就让我从零学起，参与了其中一家新店从选址、设计、装修、采购、施工，到招聘、管理等整个过程。
When I arrived, he let me start from scratch and participate in one of the new stores from site selection, design, decoration, procurement, construction, recruitment, management and so on.
今年1月8日，新店开始试运营，刚开始的营业状况也非常鼓舞人心，大家也沉浸在成功的喜悦之中，没有辜负表哥对我的期望，对自己的未来也充满信心。
On Jan. 8, the new store went live on a trial basis, and the start of business was encouraging. Everyone was so happy with their success that they lived up to what their cousins expected of me and their confidence in their future.
虽然当时，已经有一些报道和消息传出，但武汉当地人其实并没有很在意。
Although there had been some reports and news at the time, the locals in Wuhan did not really care.
尤其像我在的汉阳区，离华南海鲜市场有20多公里，完全没有病毒来袭的紧迫感。
Especially like me in the Han Yang area, away from the South China seafood market more than 20 kilometers, completely without the urgency of the virus attack.
我没有过多关注疫情的消息，还一门心思在钻研春节期间如何使新店正式步入正轨。
I did not pay too much attention to the news of the epidemic, but also focused on the Spring Festival period to make the new store formally on track.
但不承想，不到两周，由于新冠肺炎疫情，就被迫暂停营业了。
Unexpectedly, in less than two weeks, due to the new crown pneumonia epidemic, was forced to suspend business.
朱仁在协和医院门前的自拍其间，我和老婆一直没有改变过今年在武汉过春节的计划。
Zhu Ren in front of the Concorde Hospital self-photography, my wife and I have not changed this year's Spring Festival in Wuhan plans.
1月21日，老婆和女儿乘坐提前一个月“拼老命”抢到的春运高铁票来到武汉。
On January 21, his wife and daughter arrived in Wuhan on a high-speed train ticket seized a month in advance.
就算汉口火车站离华南海鲜市场很近，路上不戴口罩，扎堆的人比比皆是。
Even Hankou Railway Station is near the South China Seafood Market, the road does not wear masks, piles of people everywhere.
相反，老婆公司的老板倒是非常警觉。
On the contrary, the boss of his wife's company is very alert.
他给老婆打了个电话，让她马上下车，买票回上海。
He called his wife and told her to get off immediately and buy a ticket back to Shanghai.
可当时列车已经驶过安徽，老婆回答：“我们坐的是高铁，不是地铁，下一站就到武汉了。
But when the train had already passed Anhui, the wife replied, "We were on the high-speed railway, not the subway.
”老婆到的当天晚上，我们一家人还在饭店里聚餐，没有感到周围有太大的波澜。
"When my wife arrived the night before, we were having dinner at a restaurant and didn't feel the waves around us.
饭店内仍然人头攒动。
The hotel was still thronged.
第二天，我还带着老婆孩子去市中心的商场转了转，计划过年期间再带他们好好在武汉玩一下。
The next day, I also took my wife and children to the downtown shopping mall, planning to take them to Wuhan during the New Year.
02开始送餐，在网上看到医护人员每天吃泡面但也就是在1月22日，武汉市政府发布了疫情通告，武汉的几家最大的商场和超市全部关门了。
02 Begin to deliver food, see medical staff eating noodles every day on the Internet But on January 22, Wuhan city government issued an epidemic notice, several of Wuhan's largest shopping malls and supermarkets were closed.
我们本想预定年夜饭的，也被饭店告知不营业了。
We'd like to reserve dinner for New Year's Eve, but the hotel told us not to open.
汉口的国广、武广，武昌的汉街等全部在中午接到闭店通知，什么时候开门另行通知。
Hankou Guoguang, Wuguang, Wuchang Han Street and so on are closed at noon, when to open the door to notice.
这是什么概念，相当于上海的南京路步行街和淮海路关闭了，这个时候隐约感觉事情有点不对劲了。
What this concept is, the equivalent of Shanghai's Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street and Huaihai Road closed, this time vaguely feel something is wrong.
随即，本来想在过年期间大干一场的我和表哥商量下来先放3天假看看形势。
Immediately, originally wanted to do a great deal during the New Year and my cousin discussed first take three days off to see the situation.
1月23日，老婆一起床看手机就跟我说武汉封城了。
January 23, my wife got up to read the phone and told me that Wuhan closed the city.
我一开始还不信，结果一看手机，是真的。
At first I didn't believe it, but when I saw the phone, it was real.
凌晨2点发布的消息，上午10点出城的高速也全部关了。
Word came out at 2 a. m. that the highway out of town at 10 a. m. was shut down.
这个时候，我才感觉事情真的很严重。
It was then that I felt really serious.
当天，家附近的超市基本被清空了，所有的速冻食品、方便食品、绿叶菜、肉类等统统抢光。
On that day, the supermarket near the home was basically empty, all frozen food, ready-to-eat, green leafy vegetables, meat and so on all looted.
幸好，我表哥下午开车带着我去了另外两家大卖场，才把食品采购齐全了，买了一些生活必需品和食品。
Luckily, my cousin drove me to two other large stores in the afternoon, so he got everything he wanted and bought some necessities and food.
表哥还给了我一箱3M口罩、一瓶酒精、一堆药品：板蓝根、莲花清、抗生素等。
My cousin also gave me a case of 3M mask, a bottle of alcohol, a pile of medicines: Banlangen, lotus root, antibiotics, etc.
大概也是我们俩夫妻心大，既然出不去，那就在武汉驻守。
Probably also is our couple big heart, since cannot get out, that is in Wuhan garrison.
日子总要过的，大年夜我们吃了火锅，还包了饺子。
Day after day, we eat hot pot, but also made dumplings.
朱仁一家的年夜饭年初一，老婆孩子在家看看电视，各种视频拜年。
Zhu Ren family dinner on the first day of New Year, his wife and children at home to watch television, various video.
表哥开车接我去了店里开个员工会，准备商量一下接下来的打算。
My cousin drove me to the store for an employee meeting to discuss my next plans.
所有人到齐后，各路信息汇总，表哥说现在疫情严重，预计放假7天再看，别人什么时候开业我们就什么时候开。
After all the information gathered, Cousin said the epidemic is now serious, the holiday is expected to look at 7 days, when others open when we open.
我们有一家店是武汉最大的日料放题店，春节期间原本备了很多货，表哥提议，医护人员奋战在一线，每天却只能吃饼干泡面，我们有食材，有留守的人员，不如联系一下医院，可以给医护人员送爱心餐，尽我们一份绵薄之力。
We have a shop is Wuhan's largest daily material store, Spring Festival has been prepared a lot of goods, Cousin proposal, medical staff fighting in the front, but can only eat biscuits noodles, we have raw materials, there are left-behind people, we should contact the hospital, can send a caring meal to the medical staff, we can do our part.
说干就干。
Go ahead and do it.
我们先是联系了供货商，然后又去食药监局报了备，拿到了车辆通行许可。
We first contacted the supplier, and then went to the FDA to report for approval.
食药监检查监督意见书但最麻烦的是，我们是做自助餐的，平时并没有外卖盒。
The Food and Drug Supervisor's opinion But the most troublesome thing is that we make buffets, And we don't usually have takeout boxes.
当天下午，我嫂子的弟弟跑了好几个市场，电话打了3个多小时，才在一家没能在封城前回家过年商户的仓库里找到了3000个打包盒，等于清空了他的库存。
My sister-in-law's brother spent the afternoon in several markets and spent more than three hours on the phone before finding 3,000 bags in the warehouse of a Chinese New Year shopkeeper who couldn't get home before closing the city, emptying his inventory.
当晚我们就做了送餐海报通过饭店的公众号推送。
That night we made a poster for the meal to be sent through the hotel's public phone number.
没想到过了两个小时，就有医生加了微信订餐。
I didn't expect a doctor to order a meal until two hours later.
接着，发来订餐的医院越来越多。
Then, more and more hospitals send in orders for meals.
医生的订餐信息经过筛选，我们只选择在三家店周边区域的几家大医院进行送餐，一是因为只有两辆车参与送餐，忙不过来，二是所有送的餐都是现炒出来的，要保证一个小时全部送到位。
The doctor's orders were screened and we selected only a few major hospitals in the area around the store. One was that only two cars were involved in delivering the food, and the other was that all the meals were all made ready to be served in one hour.
两辆车分成汉口和汉阳两片区域，各派一辆车送。
Two vehicles divided into Hankou and Hanyang regions, each vehicle delivery.
武汉的同济、协和、中心医院、新华医院、金银潭医院，还有第五人民医院这些最早定点收治新冠肺炎病人的医院，都在我们的送餐范围之内。
Wuhan Tongji, Concorde, Central Hospital, Xinhua Hospital, Gold and Silver Pool Hospital, as well as the Fifth People's Hospital, the first designated hospitals to treat patients with Newcastle Pneumonia, are within the scope of our meals.
第二天，我就开始了直到现在仍在继续的送餐生涯。
The next day, I began a meal delivery career that continues to this day.
03我只是送个餐，护士却数次对我90度鞠躬送餐的第一天就发生了让人后怕的一幕。
I was just delivering a meal, and the nurse made a few scary scenes on the first day of the 90-degree bow.
第一天接单的晚上，有一个自称是武汉金银潭医院的医生发消息来问：“一客饭，你们送不送？”对方说如果不送也没关系。
On the evening of the first order, a doctor who claimed to be the Golden and Silver Pool Hospital in Wuhan sent a message asking, "Will you deliver a meal?"
想到金银潭医院是第一批收治新冠肺炎病人的医院，医生一定很辛苦，我们最终还是答应了他的请求。
The doctor must have had a hard time thinking that Gold and Silver Pool Hospital was the first hospital to treat patients with Newcomial Pneumonia.
送餐时，表哥由于找不到接头人，居然直接只戴着一个口罩，就捧着炒饭走进了病房区。
When delivering meals, cousins can not find joint people, actually wearing only a mask directly, with fried rice into the ward area.
看到周围都是身穿防护服的医生，表哥就发觉苗头不对，想要撤。
Seeing that all around is wearing protective clothing doctors, cousin found that the emergence of the wrong, want to withdraw.
但对方这时告知他，自己是已经被隔离的医生出不去，希望表哥把饭放在病房门口的护士台。
But the other side then told him that he was already isolated doctors can not get out, hope that his cousin put the food in the ward outside the nurses table.
既然答应了送餐，表哥也只有硬着头皮往里送了。
Since promised to deliver the meal, my cousin had to go inside bravely.
送餐至新华医院民航分院送完之后，表哥再三叮嘱我，以后千万不能进医院大楼，只允许送到外面，并让我每次一定要做好充分的防护措施，口罩和护目镜必须戴着，消毒水也要随身带。
After the delivery of food to Xinhua Hospital Civil Aviation Division, my cousin repeatedly told me that I must not enter the hospital building, only allowed to send outside, and I must do every time adequate protective measures, masks and goggles must be worn, disinfectant water must be brought along.
某天接头的护士很早便在医院门口等着我，从看到我从车上下来，到把饭端到她手上，再到我转身上车，她全程不停地90度深鞠躬致谢。
The nurse who met me one day was waiting for me in front of the hospital very early. From seeing me get off the bus, to bringing the meal to her hand, and when I turned to get on the bus, she took a 90-degree bow of thanks.
当时，我还在想，我就送点炒饭，不至于这么客气。
At the time, I was still thinking, I will send some fried rice, not so polite.
送餐至协和医院后来表哥跟我说，这些武汉本地的医生在前期的疫情爆发的阶段实在太累太辛苦，一天都吃不上一顿饭，已经吃了一个多星期的泡面了，能吃到这些米饭对他们来说简直就是珍馐美味了。
The food was delivered to Concorde Hospital and my cousin later told me that the local Wuhan doctors were too tired and hard-working during the early stages of the outbreak, that they had not been able to eat a meal for a day, had eaten noodles for more than a week, and that the rice was the food for them.
医生的订餐信息透露已经吃了两个星期泡面在医院里，我们还碰到过上海来的医生。
The doctor's orders revealed that he had been in the hospital for two weeks and that we had met a doctor from Shanghai.
据他说，这边的条件确实不太行，人少、设备少，病人还多。
According to him, the conditions here are really not very good, small number of people, less equipment, more patients.
在上海，可以做到4个小时一个轮班，这样即便全身防护服不吃不喝不拉，4个小时还能扛一下；但他们没来支援之前，这边的医护人员往往是8个小时一个轮班，有的甚至12小时。
In Shanghai, a four-hour shift is possible, so that even full-body protective clothing can be carried for up to four hours without food, drink, or pull; but before they come in, health-care workers here often work eight-hour shifts, sometimes even 12 hours.
12个小时不吃不喝不拉，谁吃得消！但是没办法，病人太多。
12 hours do not eat, do not pull, who can eat! But no way, too many patients.
再联想到之前鞠躬的护士，我觉得整个人像被打了一拳一样。
When I think of the nurse who bowed before me, I feel as if I had been punched.
以前送餐，对我来说更像是完成表哥交代的任务，但当时我就对自己说，只要我们有条件、有能力，就一定要给这些医护人员送最美味的饭菜，食材都挑贵的来，菜品也要更丰富一些。
It used to be more like a task for me to finish what my cousin told me to do, but I said to myself that as long as we have the means and ability, we must bring the best food to these doctors and nurses.
协和医生用餐合影我们应该说是武汉市最早一批给医护送餐的志愿者了。
We should say that Wuhan was the first group of volunteers to deliver food to medical and nursing staff.
大约过了5天，各个供应商看到我们的行动后纷纷表示愿意支援。
It took about five days for the suppliers to come forward and show their willingness to support us.
他们开始捐助物资和食材给我们——有人送了两吨大米，有人送来了三文鱼，有人送来了鲍鱼，还有人来送了四季豆、青椒等蔬菜。
They began donating supplies and ingredients to us--two tons of rice, salmon, abalone, and vegetables such as beans and bell peppers.
接收捐赠的大米有了这么多援助，我们就开始送豪华炒饭了，除了鳗鱼盖饭、肥牛盖饭之外，我们还会做三文鱼炒饭加鲍鱼。
With all the aid of donated rice, we started sending out deluxe fried rice. In addition to eels to build rice and fat cows to eat, we also cook salmon fried rice and abalone.
鲍鱼肥牛饭有些医护人员问能不能送汤，我们就用乌骨鸡炖鸡汤；有的医生提出，可不可以有酸奶，我们就去超市买当天最新鲜的；还有一个护士说生日，问我们能不能送个蛋糕，我跑了很多家店都说没有，最后给她送去了一盒巧克力……一份特殊的生日礼物在元宵节当天，我们还特意从卖场买了汤圆，每份饭都会再送一盒汤圆。
Some doctors asked us if we could have sour cream, so we went to the supermarket to buy the freshest thing of the day. Another nurse said birthday, asked if we could have a cake, and I sent her a box of chocolates.
有段时间，有供应商送来很多苹果，每份饭也会配一个苹果。
At one time, the supplier sent many apples, each rice will also be accompanied by an apple.
元宵节送汤圆总之，医护们提出的要求，能满足的我们尽量都满足，为的就是让他们吃得好一点。
To sum up, the Lantern Festival to send soup Yuan, the request of medical personnel, we can meet as much as possible, in order to let them eat a little better.
医生的感谢我们在医护圈里也有了不错的口碑，有些比较远的医院也会找我们订餐，但因为运力有限，实在送不了。
Thanks to the doctors, we also have a good reputation in the medical community, some more distant hospitals will also be looking for us to order meals, but because of limited capacity, can not deliver.
他们也表示理解，有时会派人到我们店里来取餐。
They also understand that they sometimes send people to our store to get their meals.
医生到极上馆大众点评的留言每天我们都会收到医生护士发来的感谢。
Every day we receive a thank-you note from our doctor and nurse.
有的医生还送了护目镜和手套给我们。
Some doctors gave us goggles and gloves.
他们还会自发在朋友圈，在大众点评为我们打广告。
They also spontaneously in the circle of friends, in the popular point of our advertising.
极上馆炒饭备餐但这个时候，这些都不重要了。
The Grand Hall fried rice and dinner preparation But at this point, it doesn't matter.
你们守护病人，我们守护你们。
You guard the sick, we guard you.
04女儿发烧，我一下子慌了送餐期间，还发生过一段小插曲。
04 daughter has a fever, I suddenly panic food delivery period, there was a short episode.
7岁的女儿出现发烧，一度烧到39.4度，还伴有整夜干咳、没胃口，以及呕吐的症状。
Her 7-year-old daughter developed a fever that lasted 39.4 degrees and was accompanied by dry cough throughout the night, loss of appetite and vomiting.
我觉得，99%符合新冠肺炎的症状了。
I think 99% of them are symptomatic of new crown pneumonia.
直到这个时候，我才真正感到害怕。
It was not until then that I felt really scared.
老婆也吓坏了，一度还责怪我是不是因为去医院送餐把病毒带了回来。
The wife also scared, once also scolded me for going to the hospital to send food to bring back the virus.
我极力保持冷静——每次送餐我都做足了防护，交接完后立即消毒，车子也喷洒消毒液，回家后也是马上对外衣、鞋子进行消毒。
I tried to stay cool - I protected myself every time I delivered food, disinfected my car immediately after the handover, sprayed my car with disinfectant, and disinfected my coat and shoes as soon as I got home.
所以，应该不会是我。
So, it shouldn't be me.
安抚好了老婆，我们决定暂时不去医院，因为知道由于交叉感染，大量的人因此得病。
We decided not to go to the hospital for the time being, knowing that a large number of people would fall ill as a result of cross infection.
再说，如果小孩确诊，我们两个大人也逃不掉，紧接着表哥，表哥家人，店里所有人全部要隔离。
Moreover, if the child is diagnosed, we two adults can not escape, followed by cousin, cousin family, all the store to separate.
这样的牵扯面太大了，所以我们没敢跟任何人说这个情况，让女儿在家观察。
The stakes were too high, so we didn't dare to tell anyone about it and let our daughter watch from home.
只是打电话回上海，我妈和阿姨都是医务工作者，对基础护理还是有所了解的，听了他们的意见，先给女儿服用了一些退烧药，然后每天测量两次体温，规定她必须喝1.5升热水。
At the suggestion of my mother and auntie, who were both medical workers, she was given some antipyretics and had to drink 1.5 litres of hot water twice a day.
如果一旦出现病情加重的情况就立即送医院救治。
If a case of aggravation occurs, it is referred to a hospital for immediate treatment.
在连续发了3天的烧之后，终于逐步退烧了，咳嗽也有所好转。
After three days of continuous burning, the fever has finally been gradually reduced, cough has improved.
女儿开始有鼻涕流出，也能咳出痰液。
She began to have a runny nose and coughed up sputum.
这个时候悬着的心一下子掉下来了，就是普通发烧感冒。
This time the hanging heart suddenly fell, is a common fever cold.
女儿笑笑的画：武汉加油这三天里，老婆天天抱着女儿流泪，女儿也通过新闻对这个病毒有点了解。
Wuhan refueling these three days, his wife hugged her daughter every day tears, the daughter also through the news about the virus a little.
小家伙也怕死，每次给她量体温，一旦出现37度以上，她就说这个温度计不准的。
The little one was afraid of death, and each time she took her temperature, she said the thermometer was inaccurate once it was over 37 degrees.
明明听到她干咳，她还会说我是有痰的，只是咽下去了。
When she hears her dry cough, she says I have phlegm. I just swallow it.
这让我既好笑，又心酸。
It makes me laugh and sad.
经过一周的恢复，女儿又活奔乱跳的。
After a week of recovery, my daughter was alive and kicking again.
我感觉自己就像从鬼门关里转了一圈回来了，担心她比担心自己每天去医院送餐，还要多得多。
I felt as if I had come back from a ghost walk, worried that she was going to the hospital much more than I feared.
武汉中心医院门口至今仍有人为纪念李文亮医生送来鲜花但现在回想起来，我当初这个决定也是有些不负责任的。
Wuhan Central Hospital entrance to the people still sent flowers to commemorate Dr. Lee Wenliang, but in retrospect, I was a little irresponsible at the decision.
期间，表哥还是在给医护人员送餐。
Meanwhile, my cousin was still delivering meals to the paramedics.
所幸女儿是虚惊一场。
Fortunately, the daughter is a false alarm.
不然，后果可能更严重。
Otherwise, the consequences could be worse.
05现在我们最缺的是外卖盒送餐的事，我家里人倒是一直挺支持的，不论是身边的老婆和女儿，还是在上海的父母等。
What we need most now is takeaway boxes, which my family has always been supportive of, from my wife and daughter to my parents in Shanghai.
倒是表哥的妈妈，也就是我姑妈，至今仍还瞒着她。
My cousin's mother, my aunt, was still concealing it from her.
表哥也是怕她担心，每次通电话，都说就在家待着，或着在店里看看。
Cousin is also afraid of her worry, every time on the phone, they say to stay at home, or to look at the store.
朱仁仔细核对送餐数量现在，我们从原来的500多份饭降到了两三百份，不是我们不想送。
Zhu Ren carefully checked the number of meals delivered. Now, we have dropped from more than 500 meals to two or three hundred, not that we do not want to send them.
而是有两家店的员工宿舍所在的小区，出现了确诊病例。
But has two stores the staff dormitory to be located in the small area, appeared the confirmed case.
整个小区都被隔离了，没有厨师。
The whole neighborhood is quarantined. There are no cooks.
现在只剩下一家店的员工在。
There is only one employee left in the shop.
还有一个原因是，原本我嫂子弟弟的车也没了，因为他家小区也因为同样的原因全部被封了，连车库都封了。
Another reason was that my sister-in-law's car was gone, because the family home had been closed for the same reason, even the garage.
中西医结合医院接收函好在随着疫情防控的发展，全国各地的援助力量也多了起来。
Chinese and Western medicine in combination with the hospital letter of acceptance in the development of disease prevention and control, throughout the country's assistance has also increased.
送餐的队伍也多了起来。
The number of food delivery teams has also increased.
医护人员的吃饭问题还是可以保障的。
Food for medical staff is still guaranteed.
目前，我们遇到比较大的问题是储备的外卖盒不多了，大概还能撑一周左右。
At the moment, we're having a big problem with a limited supply of take-out boxes and about a week from now.
我们也在积极联系方方面面看看能不能找到供应商。
We are also in active contact with all aspects to see if we can find suppliers.
另外，一些食材已经用完了，也比较难找。
In addition, some of the ingredients have been used up, but also more difficult to find.
所以，我们目前都改成了盖饭，肥牛和鳗鱼两种，接下去可能鳗鱼也会告急。
So now we've switched to rice, fat cows and eels, and then eels may be in danger.
我现在的生活还是很充实和规律的——每天10点出门，到点理帮忙打包、清点数量，再送餐。
I still live a full and regular life - 10: 00 each day to go out, to help pack, count the number, and then deliver meals.
完了之后，回几家店看一下，做好清洁；再跟员工联系一下，问问有没有有生病的。
After that, go back to a few stores to do a good job cleaning, and then contact the staff to ask if there is any illness.
基本上，每天下午四点左右到家。
Basically, I get home around four in the afternoon.
2月12日，作为一个17年的资深TF，我把我的经历写在了KDS宽带山论坛上。
On February 12, as a 17-year-old senior TF, I wrote my story on the KDS Broadband Mountain Forum.
本来只想问问，有没有和我一样在武汉的上海人，问问他们过得怎么样。
I just want to ask if there are any Shanghainese like me in Wuhan and ask them how they are doing.
没想到，当我先开始讲了自己的经历后，一下子引来很多人留言。
Unexpectedly, when I began to tell their own experience, suddenly attracted a lot of messages.
KDS网友在牛岛大众点评的留言你可以看到，大家都还是很关心武汉的真实状况的，所以我每天到家后，也会上网给他们说说见闻。
As you can see, everyone is still very concerned about the real situation in Wuhan, so every day after I get home, I will also give them the Internet to talk about their experience.
收到的回复都是挺正能量的。
The responses received were positive.
现在的武汉，基本生活都是可以保障的，我也让他们不用担心。
Wuhan now, the basic life can be guaranteed, I also let them not worry.
武汉这边口罩、酒精、消毒水依旧紧缺，药店排队买口罩我相信疫情很快就会过去，在这之前一定会在能力范围内坚持给他们提供最好的饭菜，让他们有体力在一线战斗。
Wuhan side of the mask, alcohol, disinfectant is still in short supply, pharmacies queuing to buy masks I believe the epidemic will soon pass, before they will be able to insist on the best possible food, so that they have the physical strength to fight on the front line.
