我一度后悔自己离开了医生这个职业，他们那么缺人，我却不能跟他们一起冲上去。
I once regretted leaving my profession as a doctor. They were so short that I couldn't rush with them.
难过、绝望、内疚……口述 |冯　翔整理 | 陈　冰……冬天腊梅花，夏天石榴花，晴天都是人，雨天都是伢。
So sad, so desperate, so guilty was Chen Xiang that in winter, pomegranate flowers in summer, sunshine everywhere, and in rainy days so strong that it was so.
过路的看风景，住家的卖清茶。
Look at the scenery, the sale of home tea.
……2017年，一首《汉阳门花园》刷爆了武汉人的朋友圈。
In 2017, a "Hanyang Gate Garden" brushes the Wuhan people's circle of friends.
2020年初，新冠病毒肆虐武汉三镇，居家隔离了一个月之久的武汉人再度听到这首《汉阳门花园》时，无不泪眼婆娑。
In early 2020, the new crown virus rages on the town of Wuhan, home isolation for a month to hear this piece of "Hanyang Gate Garden" again, all tears dance.
那些花儿啊、朵儿啊、伢儿啊，还有平日里厌烦的打牌的爹爹、闲扯的婆婆、抠脚的拐子、跳舞的嫂子……全都成了看不到的风景。
The flowers, the dawn, the new-found chemin, the tired father of cards, the gossipy mother-in-law, the bent-legged sister-in-law, the dancing sister-in-law... all become invisible.
随之消失的，还有热干面的香气，鸭脖子的香辣。
Vanished along with the aroma of hot and dry noodles, the spicy neck of duck.
空气中久久散不去的，是一股消毒水的味道。
Long in the air, is a smell of disinfectant.
冯翔在汉阳门江边录《汉阳门花园》作为一名前精神科医生，《汉阳门花园》的词曲作者、音乐人冯翔，比常人更能体会隔绝带给人的精神伤害到底有多大。
As a former psychiatrist, composer and musician Feng Xiang of Hanyang Men Garden, Feng Xiang knows better than most people how much mental harm isolation can cause.
他是金银潭医院院长张定宇的大学同班同学，一度，他为自己不能再度站在医疗前线与张定宇们一道并肩作战而深深地内疚、自责。
He was a classmate of Zhang Dingyu, director of the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital. For a time, he felt deeply guilty and blamed himself for not being able to stand on the medical front again and fight alongside Zhang Dingyu.
后来，他发现，他还可以用他一生挚爱的音乐，来抚慰人们焦躁不安的心。
Later, he discovered that he could soothe restless hearts with the music he loved most of his life.
这也是困于汉口家中的他，现在唯一能做的事。
This is the only thing he can do now, trapped in Hankou's home.
“有现在的结果已经很好了”1月21日，我去武汉市心理卫生中心开音乐治疗课，也差不多是和里面的病友做个联欢，毕竟快过年了嘛。
On January 21, I went to Wuhan Mental Health Center to hold a music therapy class, and almost with the inside of the patient to do a Huan, after all, the New Year's Eve.
当时去的时候，我根本没戴口罩，还是护士给了我一个。
When I went there, I didn't even wear a mask, and the nurse gave me one.
实际上，我当时唱着歌，已经感到一点联欢的气氛都没有了。
As a matter of fact, I was singing and I felt a little bit out of the atmosphere.
护士在那教家属怎么样回家，怎么样洗手，应该怎么戴口罩。
Nurses there teach families how to go home, how to wash their hands, and how to wear masks.
临走时，护士长问我要不要口罩，我说不需要，家里有。
Before I left, the head nurse asked me if I needed a mask. I said I didn't need one.
我当时就把它当做一个流感来防备的。
I took it as a flu precaution at the time.
回家一看，我发现我买的口罩全部都是防雾霾的那种，没用。
When I went home, I found that all the masks I bought were smog-proof, useless.
我就问当初要给我口罩的护士长，能给我一些口罩吗？她说，他们也没有了，要是需要的话，可以给我一个。
I asked the head nurse who was going to give me the mask, could I have some masks? She said, 'They don't have one, if necessary.
我当时就意识到问题的严重性。
I was aware of the seriousness of the problem.
从1月22日开始，我们一家6口就坚决不出门了。
From January 22, our family of six firmly stay out.
只有需要采购基本生活物资的时候，才由我做好防护出门一趟。
Only when the purchase of basic necessities of life, I do a good job of protection to go out.
回来以后，赶紧全身消毒。
After you get back, disinfect yourself.
尤其是吃的东西，把可能感染过病毒的食品拿回家，都不处理就吃了，或者拿清水稍微冲一下就吃了，绝对有问题！总之，这个病毒实在是太诡异了，也太强大了。
In particular, eating food that might have been infected with the virus home, eating it without even treating it, or eating it with a little rinse of water is definitely a problem.
我们普通人，在家里保证全家人的安全，就是最大的帮忙。
We ordinary people, at home to ensure the safety of the whole family, is the greatest help.
冯翔曾经工作过的地方——武汉市精神病医院。
Feng Xiang used to work in the place - Wuhan City Psychiatric Hospital.
因为辖区内有一座六角凉亭，久而久之，“六角亭”就成了武汉市精神病医院的代名词我是学医出身的，1986年毕业于同济医科大学，后来到人们熟知的“六角亭”精神病医院做了一名医生。
Because there is a hexagonal pavilion in the district, over time, "hexagonal pavilion" has become a synonym for Wuhan city psychiatric hospital I was born in medicine, graduated from Tongji Medical University in 1986, and later became known as the "hexagonal pavilion" psychiatric hospital as a doctor.
因为从小就喜欢吹拉弹唱，一直想做个文艺青年。
Because of the love of playing and singing since childhood, has always wanted to be a literary youth.
结果被家人“忽悠”，走上了靠医学拯救人性的道路。
As a result, they were "fooled" by their families and took the road of saving human nature by medicine.
但是“六角亭”工作带给我的是深深的挫败感，2005年，我从医院“逃跑”了。
But the hexagonal pavilion job brought me a deep sense of frustration when, in 2005, I "ran away" from the hospital.
我北漂京城搞了十年的音乐艺术，最后又两手空空地回到了武汉。
After ten years of musical art, I returned to Wuhan empty-handed.
没想到，《汉阳门花园》让我红了。
I didn't expect that Hanyang Gate Garden made me red.
前几天，全球19个国家50位音乐人一起联手演唱了一首为武汉加油的中国歌曲《在路上》，我很荣幸作为武汉音乐人的代表，用英文演唱了歌曲的开头部分。
A few days ago, 50 musicians from 19 countries joined hands to sing a Chinese song, "On the Road," to cheer Wuhan, and I was honored to sing the beginning of the song in English as the representative of Wuhan Musicians.
对于这次疫情，我自己一直都很难过。
I myself have been very sad about this outbreak.
因为我是医生，更知道这个事情的难度。
Because I'm a doctor, I know how difficult it is.
病毒没有时间让你去想啊，所以，就全世界任何一个国家来说，我们有全世界最好的动员能力、最大的防护用品生产规模，加上后来坚决的措施，有现在的结果已经很好了。
The virus doesn't have time for you to think about it, so for any country in the world, we have the best mobilization capacity in the world, the scale of the largest production of protective equipment, and later determined measures, and the results are now very good.
实际上，人类对于疫情根本没有做好准备，特别是精神上的。
In fact, humans are simply not prepared for the epidemic, especially the spirit.
我们以为我们有经验了，经历过SARS、中东呼吸综合征（MERS），可是当疫情真正来临的时候，你会发现过往的那些经验都不管用了。
We thought we were experienced with SARS, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), but when the outbreak does come, you will find that past experience is of no use.
当你知道是这样的情况的时候，你就不会觉得自己特别不幸或者幸运。
When you know this is the case, you don't feel particularly unfortunate or lucky.
不是说我换个地方或者我换一种方法可能就好了。
It's not like I could change places or I could use another way.
在这种环境下面，你就会遭受这样的灾难，这让人特别难过。
It is particularly distressing that you should suffer such a disaster under such circumstances.
金银潭医院院长张定宇是冯翔的大学同班同学。
Zhang Ding-woo is a classmate of Fengxiang University.
张定宇一直是大家心中的“学霸医生”还有一方面也让我感到很难过。
Zhang Dingyu has always been the heart of the "learned doctor" on one hand also let me feel very sad.
医生护士冲在前头拼命。
The doctor and nurse rushed to the front.
不是说英不英雄的问题，你只有一条路，就是当英雄。
It's not a question of not being a hero. You only have one way to be a hero.
其实很早的时候，大概1月10号不到，我同学、金银潭医院的院长张定宇就开始每天拼命地扩大隔离病房了。
In fact, very early, about January 10, my classmate, the director of the gold and silver pool hospital Zhang Dingyu began to desperately expand the isolation ward every day.
金银潭就是个专业医院，不像协和、同济那种大医院，有的是钱，就那么点东西，那么点人，能扩大到多少？无论怎么拼命，病房一直不够，医护用品也一直不够，全院的医生全调动起来了，也没什么特别的防护，戴个口罩帽子就冲进病房治疗病人了，随时随地，你就有可能变成病人了。
The gold and silver pool was a professional hospital, not like the Concorde and Tongji big hospitals, with plenty of money, just a few things, how much more could be expanded? No matter how hard you tried, the wards were always inadequate, medical supplies were always inadequate, the hospital doctors were mobilized and there was no special protection.
我年前去的武汉市精神卫生中心也沦陷了。
The Wuhan Mental Health Center, which I visited last year, also fell.
2月9日，媒体报道里面至少有大约50名患者和30名医务人员确诊感染了新冠肺炎。
On 9 February, the media reported that at least 50 patients and 30 medical personnel had been confirmed to have contracted pneumonia.
好些个我的前同事们，自己都被感染了。
Some of my former colleagues are infected themselves.
然后，在隔离病房里，他们就一边在做患者接受治疗，然后一边又做医生再去看病。
Then, in the isolation ward, they were treated as patients, then as doctors.
有个到最后实在看不动了，自己的双肺全白了，成了重症患者。
One finally really can not see, his lungs are all white, has become a serious patient.
我一度后悔自己离开了医生这个职业，他们那么缺人，我却不能跟他们一起冲上去。
I once regretted leaving my profession as a doctor. They were so short that I couldn't rush with them.
难过、绝望、内疚……每次看那些新闻，我的心都要碎了，我一边听、一边伤感，眼泪不由自主地夺眶而出。
Sadness, despair, guilt... Every time I read that news, my heart would break. As I listened and felt sad, tears began to flow from my eyes.
人老了，为什么容易流泪，大概是因为眼睛代替了嘴巴所说不出的悲伤吧。
People are old, why easy to shed tears, probably because the eyes instead of the mouth said the sad bar.
用音乐疗伤是啊，我不能怪商家没有准备我想要的菜；不能怪邻居得了这个病，还传染了别人；不能怪政府封城了，封路了，封小区了，我们哪儿都不能去了……所有的一切，我只能承受着。
I can't blame the merchants for not preparing the food I wanted; I can't blame the neighbors for the disease and the contagion; we can't blame the government for blocking the city, sealing the roads, sealing the neighborhood, we can't go anywhere... all this, I can only bear it.
但是人承受这种东西一定是有极限的，只要有一天承受不下去了，就会开始怪某个人，怪所有人，怪这个世界。
But people must bear this kind of thing there must be limits, as long as one day can not bear it, will start to blame someone, blame everyone, blame the world.
我媳妇儿说，你不能老这么颓废吧？总得干点能干的事情啊。
My daughter-in-law said, can't you always be so decadent? You've got to do something useful.
冯翔希望用歌声来疗伤我想我不是搞音乐的嘛，然后我还学过音乐治疗。
Feng Xiang hopes to cure his wounds with songs. I guess I'm not a musician, and then I learned music therapy.
这种情况下，人一般到了晚上就特别亢奋。
In this case, people are usually very excited in the evening.
发帖，造谣，辟谣，互相争吵！要不我就给大家唱歌，让大家晚上能够安静下来，平复一点。
Post, rumor, deny rumors, quarrel with each other! Or I'll sing to everyone so that everyone can calm down and calm down a little at night.
实际上，心情烦躁的时候，听点民谣确实能缓解一下。
In fact, when you are upset, listening to some folk songs can really relieve you.
因为民谣都是在讲故事 ，而且，基本上不会是晦涩难懂的故事。
Because the ballad is telling a story, and, basically, will not be an obscure story.
其次，民谣的音乐都是和口语有更强的相关性，它能让你听到一个“人”在跟你倾诉，而不是一个高高在上的“ICON”在展示。
Second, the folk music is more related to spoken English, it allows you to hear a "person" talking to you, rather than a "ICON" on display.
所以，我就先试了一下微博直播。
So I tried microblogging first.
第一次我自己感觉很好，觉得自己安静下来了，怨天尤人的情绪也转移了。
For the first time I felt fine, I felt quiet and resentful.
做了大概三四次之后，网易云音乐正好在做卧室音乐节，邀请我参加，和全国的音乐人一起，用音乐给大家疗伤。
After about three or four times, Netease Music is doing the bedroom music festival, inviting me to join the national musicians, using music to heal everyone.
透过手机屏幕，我们就好像站在每个人的身边唱歌，所有的怨气竟然神奇地消失了。
Through the cellphone screen, we seem to be standing next to everyone singing, all the grievances magically disappeared.
就在那短短的一个半小时里，我们每一个参与其中的人，似乎都获得了短暂的救赎。
In that short hour and a half, every one of us who was involved seemed to have been redeemed for a while.
我还参加了一个全国性质的心理援助项目，2月18日给方舱医院里面的医患做了一次讲座，讲一些关于音乐治疗的方法，告诉大家怎么用音乐这个工具让自己的情绪平复下来，或者说减缓自己焦虑紧张的情绪。
I also took part in a nationwide psychological assistance program, giving a lecture on music therapy to doctors and patients at Fang Ngau Hospital on February 18, telling people how to use music as a tool to calm down, or to relieve their anxiety and nervousness.
在旋律、和声及节奏的语言之中,隐藏着控制我们情绪的密码，就像亚里士多德说的，“借由音乐，人们将感受到正确的情绪”。
In the language of melody, harmony, and rhythm, lurks the code that governs our emotions, as Aristotle said, "through music, people will feel the right emotions."
音乐可以引发我们体内的恩多芬大量释放，令人精神愉快，心情舒适。
Music can trigger the release of a large number of our body, a pleasant, comfortable mood.
我在这个课上边唱边说了一个半小时，一件特别感动我的事情发生了。
I sang and spoke in this class for an hour and a half, and something particularly touching happened to me.
一个心理治疗师听完讲座以后，过来给我转账，说这是我的治疗费。
A psychotherapist, after attending the lecture, came over to transfer money to me, saying it was my treatment.
她说这是她这么长时间以来，第一次觉得突然放松了，然后痛哭了一场。
She said it was the first time in such a long time that she felt suddenly relaxed and cried.
是啊，这么长时间以来，大家一直处在疫情之中，整个状态都是绷着的。
Yeah, for a long time, people have been in the epidemic, the whole situation is tensed.
一旦疫情解除，绷紧的弦一下子松下来，就很容易出问题。
Once the outbreak is over and the strain of the string is released, it is easy to go wrong.
这其实是一个次生灾害了，精神方面的援助需求会大量出现。
This is in fact a secondary disaster, mental assistance needs will arise in large numbers.
我还特别想说说逝者和他们的家庭。
I would also like to speak in particular about the dead and their families.
我虽然难过，还只是我的生活、情感在遭受灾难的影响，但那些无法回来的人们，还有他们的家庭所承受的痛苦，我们是不可能真正体会的。
Although I am sad, but my life, emotional suffering in the disaster, but those who can not return, and their families suffered, we can not really understand.
他们需要帮助，但现在他们还在继续挣扎着坚持着让家里剩下的人活下去。
They need help, but they are still struggling to keep the rest of the family alive.
可能得等疫情过去，他们才会在回忆里一遍遍经受痛苦。
They may have to wait until the epidemic is over before they suffer in their memories.
他们真的需要帮助。
They really need help.
我现在也在准备，一旦这个事情结束了，我就必须去做心理援助的事情，有可能我还会直接回医院上班了。
I'm also preparing for the fact that once this is over, I'll have to do some psychological support and probably go straight back to the hospital.
现在，我每周一晚上9点在微博开直播，一个轻轻松松的系列，跟大家聊聊影响我的各种各样的音乐，这些音乐人的故事，然后唱他们的歌，也会唱我自己的歌，每次一个半小时。
Now, I live on Twitter at 9: 00 every Monday night, an easy series to talk about all the different kinds of music that affect me, the stories of these musicians, and then sing their songs and my own songs for an hour and a half at a time.
以后还可能把音乐治疗的内容放进去，做成另外一个系列。
In the future it may be possible to add music therapy to another series.
我还希望在听直播的人，能够把自己生活的点点滴滴变成歌！微博直播，让我觉得起码我的生活又丰满起来了。
I also hope that the people listening to live, can turn their own life bit by bit into songs! Weibo live, let me feel that at least my life has plump up again.
对，我就在做我力所能及的事情。
Yeah, I'm doing what I can.
一方面，它给别人带来了好处。
On the one hand, it brings benefits to others.
但是，更直接的，是给我自己带来了好处——我再也不用一天到晚自怨自艾的了。
But, more directly, I've done myself good - I don't have to be sorry for myself all day long.
我也不用很内疚了，因为我其实是在另外一条很重要战线上——精神战线上和我的前同仁们一起战斗！让我们一起用音乐来疗伤，去倾听生命的声音，去释放情感的力量。
I don't have to feel guilty because I'm on another important front - fighting with my ex-colleagues on the mental front! Let's use music to heal wounds, listen to the voice of life, and unleash the power of emotions.
我是武汉的冯翔，我在直播间等着你。
I'm Feng Xiang from Wuhan. I'm waiting for you in the studio.
