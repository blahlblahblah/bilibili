//“在清水里泡三次，在血水里浴三次，在碱水里煮三次，我们就会纯净得不能再纯净”。
/ / "Soak three times in clean water, bathe three times in blood, and boil three times in alkaline water, and we will be as pure as ever.
托尔斯泰在《苦难的历程》中如此描述人们从革命走向胜利的艰辛过程，在此时，身处武汉的一线医务工作者又何尝不是经历着清水、碱水甚至血水的浸泡，守住了抗疫中的每一天。
When Tolstoy describes the arduous journey from revolution to victory in "The Journey of Suffering," the front-line medical workers in Wuhan have not experienced the immersion of water, alkaline water and even blood to hold every day of the epidemic.
······2月13日以来，全国新增确诊人数和死亡人数都开始明显下降。
Since February 13, the number of newly diagnosed cases and deaths nationwide has begun to decline markedly.
至暗时刻已过，与新冠肺炎的“持久战”拉开了序幕。
By the end of the day, the "protracted war" with Newcastle pneumonia had begun.
这个曾被称为“东方芝加哥”的城市里骤然安静，却悄然多了数万“居民”，他们是从全国各地抵达武汉及湖北地区的4万余名医务人员。
The city, once known as "Eastern Chicago," suddenly quieted down but quietly added tens of thousands of residents, some 40,000 of whom had arrived in Wuhan and Hubei from all over the country.
人们称这些前往一线的医护人员为“逆行者”，象征他们逆着人流、奔赴前线的英勇与果敢，其实，在那些让我们感动流泪的壮举下，在他们度过的一个又一个的抗疫日子里，包含着无数个或艰难或感动或温情的“日常”瞬间——01“你忙的时候，就感觉不到饿了”武汉第九医院护士潘茹兰一个月前的1月22日，整个九院接到了成为定点医院的通知。
People call these frontline medical personnel "Reverse walkers," a symbol of their courage and determination to go against the flow of people, to the front line, in fact, in those days of struggle against the flow of people, they have spent countless or difficult or moved or warm "everyday" moment, 01 "you busy, not hungry," Wuhan Ninth Hospital Nurse Panzul January 22, a month ago, the entire hospital was notified as a designated hospital.
以前还分科室的护士，集结后被打散、分配到各个楼层。
Before also divided the department nurses, after the assembly was scattered, assigned to each floor.
我先是到ICU工作了一个多星期，ICU被陕西支援队接管后，我又被分配到发热留观病区工作。
I first worked in the ICU for more than a week, and after the ICU was taken over by the Shaanxi Support Team, I was assigned to work in the fever ward.
我上班10年，从来没有觉得：怎么这么难？这个病进展很快，前两天看到病人还蛮好的，两天后马上喘不上气，再过两天人一下就走了。
I had been at work for ten years and I never thought: How could it be so difficult? The disease is progressing so fast, I saw the patient quite well the other day, and two days later I was out of breath.
医院里的压抑氛围一直到2月中旬有所消减。
The oppressive atmosphere in the hospital subsided until mid-February.
无论医护人员、病人，还是百姓，都越来越体会到这是一场"持久战"。
Medical workers, patients, and people are increasingly aware that it was & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot;
我们现在仍是三班倒。
We are still running on three shifts.
白班是从8点一直上到下午5点，中间不可能休息。
Day shifts run from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., and there is no way to rest.
为了节省防护物资，再加上反复脱穿防护服，还会增加感染几率。
In order to save on protective equipment, coupled with repeated wearing protective clothing, but also increased the risk of infection.
所以只要投入工作，我们就不吃饭、不喝水，饿一天，然后到下午下了班，回酒店再吃。
So as long as we get to work, we don't eat, we don't drink, we starve for a day, and then we leave work in the afternoon and go back to the hotel.
盒饭吃腻了，我们会在酒店里泡点面，搭配点咸菜，“改善”一下生活。
Boxed rice tired, we will be in the hotel bubble noodle, with pickled vegetables, "improve" life.
咸菜是同事从家带来的。
The pickles were brought home by colleagues.
一包咸菜，用公筷分成四份。
A bag of pickled vegetables, divided into four chopsticks.
等疫情结束之后，我一定要吃顿烤肉，和同事逛街，赶紧回到原来的生活中去。
When the epidemic is over, I must have a barbecue, go shopping with my co-workers, and get back to where I am.
02“和家人联系就像是留言板联系”雷神山医院护士周瑞（来自上海中医药大学附属龙华医院）我是上海来的，来自上海中医药大学。
02 "Contact with family is like message board contact" Lei Shenshan Hospital Nurse Zhou Rui (from Longhua Hospital of Shanghai TCM University) I am from Shanghai, I come from Shanghai TCM University.
事情太多了，乍一想，也记不清是哪天来的，大概是2月15号到的武汉。
There are so many things that at first thought, I can't remember which day it was in Wuhan, which arrived on February 15th.
我刚到雷神山时，医院还在筹备。
When I first arrived at Raytheon Hill, the hospital was still in preparation.
每天都有从四面八方赶来的医护人员、管理人员，边工作边磨合。
Every day from all sides of the medical personnel, management personnel, while working wear and tear.
人手不够，所有人都是身兼数职。
We're understaffed. We're all part-timers.
没有人停在那里，只要有事情或是有任务了，一叫立刻到，像货架、衣柜、病床搬运。
No one stopped there. Whenever there was something to do or a task to do, a shout just arrived, like shelves, wardrobes, hospital beds.
©️中新网可武汉毕竟和家总是不太一样。
Zhu Zhongxin can be Wuhan after all and home is always different.
同事们都说，我们现在和家人有时差。
Colleagues say we have jet lag with our families right now.
和家人联系就像是留言板联系。
Connecting with your family is like a message board.
凌晨一、两点，我结束工作了，会发个短信跟家人说“我很好”。
At 1 or 2 in the morning, when I finished work, I would send a text message to my family saying, "I'm fine."
第二天早上家人看到、再回一个“好的，你注意身体”。
The next morning the family saw and returned with another "OK, you pay attention to the body."
但那时我已经又开始工作，看不了手机了。
But by then I was back at work, unable to see my cell phone.
哪怕有时差，哪怕像留言板，我每天在手机上打出"我很好"时，心里会舒服很多，好像和家近了很多。
Even with a time difference, such as a message board, I used to say & quot; & quot; at & quot; I & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & #
03"全国各地来支援的车，全部往这个地方集中”雷神山医院护士严翠、翁玲丽（来自上海市第五人民医院）我们来自上海，因为响应政府的号召，也没想太多，我们就来了。
Ren Cui and Weng Lingli, nurses from Shanghai's Fifth People's Hospital. We came from Shanghai because we didn't think too much about answering the government's call.
昨天我们从路上过来的时候，其实一路上也没有什么人，但是一到雷神山医院附近，人猛地一下就变多了。
Yesterday when we came from the road, in fact, there were no people along the way, but as soon as the Raytheon Hill Hospital, people suddenly became more.
我看到有好多的工人，医务人员，也看到好多我们上海的医护同仁……算上我们一起来的500多人，现在支援雷神山的上海医护人员快1000人了。
I see a lot of workers, medical staff, and a lot of our medical staff in Shanghai... including more than 500 of us, there are now nearly 1,000 medical workers in Shanghai to support Raytheon Mountain.
虽然都不认识，可看到防护服，心里的感觉不仅是亲切，更多的是并肩战斗的战友情谊。
Although all do not know, can see the protective clothing, the feeling in the heart is not only cordial, more is the comrade-in-arms side-by-side.
©️ 中新网说心里话，在武汉，工作强度挺大，身上、手上都因为不断消毒或者磕碰的小伤口。
Zheng Zhongxin Zhongxin Zheng dialect, in Wuhan, the intensity of the work is very strong, because the body, hands are constantly disinfected or kowtow small wounds.
身体似乎也习惯了每天穿防护服、戴手套那种从疼到麻的过程。
The body seems to be used to wearing protective clothing and gloves from pain to hemp every day.
说不害怕是假的，但一进入这里，看到全国各地的支援全部往这个地方来，害怕、担心就都忘了。
It is false to say no to fear, but as soon as you enter here and see all the aid coming from all over the country coming to this place, fear, fear are forgotten.
今天等车的时候，看到街边叶子都绿了，看到街边都冒绿芽了。
Today, when waiting for the bus, see the street leaves are green, see the street green buds.
希望春暖花开时，举国无恙。
I hope the country is safe when spring blossoms.
04“ 真希望在武汉樱花烂漫时，生活可以恢复到往常的喧嚣”雷神山综合管理部负责人黄康（来自武汉大学中南医院）1月20日当晚，我们负责的病区投入使用，完成了收治病人。
"I hope life can be back to normal when Wuhan cherry blossoms are blooming," said Huang Kang, director of Lui Shenshan Comprehensive Management Department (from Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital).
目前生活物资比较充足。
At present, living materials are more adequate.
我主要负责对接各个地方的爱心企业，每天联系电话不断，已经收到300多个爱心企业的捐赠。
I am mainly responsible for docking the love enterprises in various places, daily telephone contact, has received more than 300 charitable enterprises donation.
我们也将捐赠用品在第一时间全部分发给医护人员。
We also distribute the donated supplies to the medical staff at the first time.
我们很多医护人员在病房全天十几个小时的工作里，要用酒精来洗手。
Many of us wash our hands with alcohol while working in the ward for more than ten hours a day.
酒精对整个手的损伤挺大的。
Alcohol does a lot of damage to the whole hand.
很多医生手上指纹都没了。
Many doctors don't have fingerprints.
洗护、沐浴和护手用品，现在也不好买。
Shampoo, showers and hand protection are not easy to buy right now.
前几天百雀羚送来了第一批护手霜、洗发水，一下子就发光了。
A few days ago, wildebeest brought the first batch of hand cream and shampoo, and immediately glowed.
· · · · · ·在抗疫一线，日夜奋战的医护人员，每次脱下防护服的过程需要洗手12次，每4小时就要重复一次，长时间接触消毒液、酒精等腐蚀性较高的化学制剂，双手被腐蚀得伤痕累累；因长期佩戴口罩等防护设备而在脸上烙下“疫痕”；就近的宾馆、宿舍、临时改建的休息场所里生活物资相对缺乏，白衣天使们的双手和皮肤粗糙开裂。
On the front lines of the epidemic, medical personnel battle day and night to wash their hands 12 times and repeat every 4 hours. They are exposed to corrosive chemicals such as disinfectant and alcohol for long periods of time.
而这一双双布满伤痕的手，虽是细节，却让百雀羚集团无法释怀。
And this pair of scarred hands, although the details, but let the wildebeest group can not forget.
百雀羚集团第一时间成立疫情应对专项小组，迅速联合中国性病艾滋病防治协会、中国预防性病艾滋病基金会与前线各医院取得联系并沟通需求，确定捐赠2亿卫生清洁护理物资的目标。
The wildebeest group immediately set up an epidemic prevention and treatment team, and quickly joined forces with the China Association for the Prevention and Control of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and AIDS and the China Foundation for the Prevention of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and AIDS to contact the front-line hospitals and communicate their needs.
百雀羚集团第一时间响应，确定捐赠2亿卫生清洁护理物资的目标就像上海百雀羚集团市场总监费琪文在采访中所说：“我们希望更加聚焦，让资源能够发挥最大的帮助，当发现有非常非常多的全国各个医疗队的白衣天使们，正在逆行去支援武汉，我们立马觉得应该为这群人做一些我们力所能及的事情。
The wildebeest group immediately responded by setting a goal of donating 200 million health care materials. As Michael Fairfax, the Shanghai wildebeest group's marketing director, said in an interview: "We want to be more focused and to make the most of our resources.
” Play △ 百雀羚“在路上”公益纪录片2月6日，伴随着“武汉加油”“中国加油”的呐喊与祝福，从位于浙江嘉善的百雀羚仓库驶出了第一辆满载着13吨生活物资的卡车。
A gazelle named "On the Road" drove the first truck loaded with 13 tons of supplies from a wildebeest warehouse in Jiashan, Zhejiang province, on Feb. 6, along with the cries and wishes of Wuhan refueling and China refueling.
在从浙江到武汉的800多公里路程上，百雀羚捐赠的物资开始源源不断地运往武汉市第五医院、武汉市第一医院、武汉大学附属同仁医院、武汉市第四医院.......百雀羚已先后落实五批次物资，累计捐赠价值1.12亿元，支持湖北各地82家医院截至发稿为止，随着捐赠物资一批批抵达武汉市雷神山医院、武汉市金银潭医院、武汉市江岸方舱医院、孝感市中心医院、黄冈市中心医院……百雀羚已先后落实五批次物资，累计捐赠价值1.12亿元，已支持包括湖北武汉、孝感、黄冈、随州、襄阳等各地82家医院，让一线医护人员可以在结束一天的辛苦工作后，用上洗发水、沐浴露，洗一个热水澡，临睡前为疲惫的双手涂抹上护手霜。
Up to the end of the day, 82 hospitals in Wuhan city have received five batches of materials worth 112 million yuan, including Wuhan, Xiaogan City Central Hospital, Huanggang City Central Hospital and Huanggang City Central Hospital.
让辛苦的抗疫中，多些暖意和幸福。
Let the hard-fought plague, more warmth and happiness.
“说实话，是有一点小骄傲的，毕竟是用自己的方式，做了一点贡献。
"To tell you the truth, there is a little bit of pride, after all, in their own way, made a little contribution.
”这句从百雀羚驰援行动司机小哥嘴里说出的话，更是百雀羚每一个员工的心声。
The words from the mouth of a wildebeest driver are the voice of every employee of the wildebeest.
©️ 燃新闻“流感突起，肺炎逼至，想父亲安康？……您于院中应多加留意，谨防传染。
Zhen Zhengfei news "flu burst, pneumonia forced, want your father well-being?... you should pay more attention in the hospital, be careful not to infect.
吾坚信没有一个冬天不可逾越，病毒肆虐的当下，亦如是。
I firmly believe that no winter is insurmountable, the virus rages in the present, so it is.
”这是一个14岁的女孩，给身在抗疫前线医生父母写下的动情文字，我们依然相信没有一个冬天不可逾越、没有一个春天不会到来，恰恰是因为那些最值得敬爱的人们，依然还站在抗疫的最前线，为我们坚守与付出。
"This is a 14-year-old girl, to the parents of the doctors at the front line of the epidemic, we still believe that there is no insurmountable winter, no spring will not come, precisely because those most worthy of respect are still on the front line of the fight against the epidemic, standing firm and giving for us.
医护人员的坚守，因为所热爱的生活。
Health care workers adhere to, because of the love of life.
全国各界的驰援，因为所热爱的生活。
All over the country, because of the love of life.
我们每个人的努力，因为所热爱的生活。
Each of us works hard because of the life we love.
即将到来的2020年春天，必定让人难忘。
The coming spring of 2020 is bound to be unforgettable.
因为有太多的人在终点是胜利的道路上拼搏着、有太多双清水洗过、血水浴过、碱水泡过的手，正竭尽全力地共同打造了每个人都无比热爱的生活。
Because too many people struggle on the road to victory, too many double- washed, blood-bathed, soda-soaked hands, are working hard together to create a life everyone loves.
