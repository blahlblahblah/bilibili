流动差、规模小的航空公司将异常艰难陈亮 王静仪 | 文施智梁 | 编辑2020年2月21日， 沈阳桃仙国际机场，工作人员引导旅客上飞机。
Poor-mobility, small airlines will have a tough time at Chen Liang Wang Jingyi and Ren Shi. & # 44; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & nbsp; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & #
图/中新曾经工作日凌晨5点多就有旅客大排长队的上海虹桥机场，在新型冠状病毒（下称“新冠病毒”）疫情肆虐下，显得异常冷清。
Photo / Zhongxin has long queues of passengers at Shanghai Hongqiao Airport at 5: 00 a.m. on a weekday. The airport is very cold under the new coronavirus epidemic.
往返京沪之间的商务客也难觅踪迹。
Business travelers are also hard to find between Beijing and Shanghai.
2月26日中午，虹桥机场B岛值机柜台处于关闭状态，开放的A岛柜台也是人烟稀少。
At noon on February 26, the check-in counter on Island B at Hongqiao Airport was closed and the counter on the open island of A was sparsely populated.
在疫情期间坐过飞机的高鹏向《财经》记者感叹，浦东机场偌大的东航休息室内，仅有5人，简直可以随便躺。
Gao Peng, who flew the plane during the outbreak, lamented to Caijing that the vast east lounge at Pudong Airport has only five people who can simply lie down.
上述现象在各大航司的经营数据上有更为直接的体现。
The above phenomenon is more directly reflected in the operating data of the major airlines.
1月经营数据显示，中国国际航空股份有限公司（601111.SH/00753.HK/ADR OTC:AIRYY/LSE:AIRC，下称“国航”）、中国南方航空股份有限公司（600029.SH/01055.HK/NYSE:ZNH，下称“南航”）和中国东方航空股份有限公司（600115.SH/00670.HK/NYSE:CEA，下称“东航”）旅客周转量分别同比下降2.9％、2.42％、1.28％。
January operating data show that passenger turnover at Air China Limited (601111.SH / 00753.HK / ADR OTC: AIRYY / LSE: AIRC (hereinafter referred to as Air China), China Southern Airlines (600029.SH / 01055.HK / NYSE: ZNH) and China Eastern Airlines Ltd. (600115.SH / 00670. HK / NYSE: CEA, respectively.
旅客周转量是运送旅客人数与运送距离的乘积，既反映运输的数量，又反映运输的距离，能全面地反映运输的成果。
Passenger turnover is the product of the number of passengers transported multiplied by the distance travelled, reflecting not only the volume of transport but also the distance travelled, thus providing a comprehensive picture of the results of transport.
客座率也不乐观。
The attendance rate was also not encouraging.
海南航空控股股份有限公司（600221.SH，下称“海航”）、上海吉祥航空股份有限公司（603885.SH，下称“吉祥航空”）和春秋航空股份有限公司（601021.SH，下称“春秋航空”）1月客座率同比各自下降了9.21％、6.84％和7.85％。
Hainan Airlines Holdings S.A. (600221.SH), Shanghai Jixiang Airlines (603885.SH) and Chunqiu Airlines (601021.SH) are down 9.21%, 6.84% and 7.85% year-on-year.
更可怕的是大量航班停飞导致现金流紧张。
Even more frightening is the cash flow strain caused by the suspension of a large number of flights.
民航业一直是一个高投入、高风险的行业。
Civil aviation has always been a high-input, high-risk industry.
不少航空公司已经选择发债与降低人力成本来控制现金流出。
Many airlines have opted to issue debt and reduce labor costs to control cash outflows.
然而这都是短期措施，春秋航空副总裁张武安对《财经》记者表示，要想获得大量现金流主要靠定期航班的恢复。
However, these are short-term measures, Zhang Wuan, vice-president of Chunqiu Airlines, told Caijing.
去哪儿网副总裁兰翔向《财经》记者指出，目前很多旅客对航班的搜索量没有降低。
Lanxiang, vice-president of Caijing, told Caijing that the number of flights searched by many passengers has not decreased.
由此可以看出，很多旅客的出行需求还没有释放，这部分可能都是刚需出行旅客，比如需要返程工作或者出差的人群。
As can be seen, many travelers' travel needs have not yet been released, and this may be partly due to new arrivals, such as those who need to return to work or travel.
至少有 800 万人次民航返程需求等待释放。
At least 8 million civil aviation return flights are pending release.
出行是刚需，航班终究会逐步复苏。
Travel is just needed, the flight will eventually recover gradually.
飞友科技的数据显示，内地航空公司2月25日总体航班执行率较前一日增长3.78％。
According to Feifei Technology, the overall performance rate of mainland airlines on Feb. 25 was 3.78% higher than the previous day.
但是缓慢的增长能让航空公司应对接下来的传统淡季吗？缺少春运收入的航空公司还能撑到暑运旺季吗？缺钱的航空公司偿债能力弱，现金少，融资能力弱的航司举步维艰“免费退票政策实行以来，截至目前，国内外航空公司共办理免费退票2000万张，涉及票面总金额超过200亿元。
But will slow growth allow airlines to cope with the coming lean season? Can airlines that lack revenue survive the summer season? Cash-strapped airlines are insolvent, cash-strapped, and the airline's financing capacity is weak.
”这是中国民航局副局长李健在2月15日的国务办新闻发布会上给出的数据。
That's according to Li Jian, deputy director of China's Civil Aviation Administration, at a press conference at the State Office on February 15.
一边要免费退票、支付员工工资，另一边又因缺少旅客要削减大量航班，航空公司的支出大增，收入却锐减，各大航空公司的日子都不好过。
Airlines are having a tough time paying for free tickets, paying staff and cutting back on flights because of a shortage of passengers, while airlines have seen their revenues plummet.
中国民航业一直是高负债的行业。
China's civil aviation industry has always been a highly indebted industry.
根据各家上市航空公司2019年三季度报告显示，国航、南航、东航、海航、春秋航空、吉祥航空负债率分别为64.8％、73.9％、74.5％、65％、49.4％、55.8％。
According to the airline's 2019 quarterly report, Air China, China Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, Air China, Chunqiu Airlines, lucky air debt ratio of 64.8 percent, 73.9 percent, 74.5 percent, 65 percent, 49.4 percent and 55.8 percent, respectively.
除机队规模在100架左右的两家民营航司外，规模较大的四家航空公司的负债率都处于高位状态。
In addition to the fleet size of about 100 in the two private aviation departments, the larger four airlines are in a high debt ratio.
国航旗下的深圳航空最近三年负债率更是在85％左右的高位。
Air China's Shenzhen Airlines debt ratio has been around 85 per cent for the past three years.
仅仅是高负债，对航空公司来说并不致命，没有偿债能力和现金流最为致命。
High debt alone is not fatal to airlines, and insolvency and cash flow are the most deadly.
从2019年三季报来看，越大型的航空公司，偿债能力越不强。
According to the 2019 quarterly report, the larger the airline, the less solvent it is.
国航流动比率为0.3，速动比率为0.29；南航流动比率为0.13，速动比率为0.17；东航流动比率为0.26，速动比率为0.22；海航流动比率为0.44，速动比率为0.43；吉祥航空流动比率为0.71，速动比率为0.69；春秋航空流动比率为1.14，速动比率为1.13。
Air China has a current ratio of 0.3 and a quick ratio of 0.29; China Southern has a current ratio of 0.13 and a fast rate of 0.17; East China has a current ratio of 0.26 with a fast rate of 0.43; a maritime airway ratio of 0.44 with a fast rate of 0.43; an auspicious air flow ratio of 0.71 with a quick ratio of 1.14 with a quick ratio of 1.13.
一般来说流动比率为2、速动比率为1，是公司偿债能力的理想模型。
Generally speaking, the current ratio is 2 and the quick ratio is 1, which is an ideal model of a company's solvency.
数值越低，偿债能力越差。
The lower the value, the less solvency.
除国航和海航外，南航、东航、春秋航空、吉祥航空的应收账款周转天数均低于10天，这也就意味着航空公司得靠收现金维持。
In addition to Air China and Air China, China Airlines, Chunqiu Airlines, lucky air accounts receivable turnover days are less than 10 days, which means that airlines have to rely on cash maintenance.
2020年中国新冠肺炎疫情暴发以来，中国航空公司没有享受到春运带来的红利，现金流入大幅减少。
Since the outbreak of China's New Crown Pneumonia outbreak in 2020, Chinese airlines have not enjoyed the dividends of spring transportation, and cash inflows have plummeted.
有的航空公司甚至停航，完全断绝现金流入。
Some airlines have even stopped flights, completely cutting off cash inflows.
2月18日，为期40天的2020年春运结束。
On 18 February, the 40-day spring transport ended in 2020.
40天内民航发送旅客3839万人次，同比下降47.5％。
In 40 days, 38.39 million passengers were sent by civil aviation, down 47.5 percent year on year.
就在2019年12月，交通运输部曾预测2020年春运民航旅客运输量将达7900万人次。
As recently as December 2019, the Ministry of Transport had predicted that 79 million passengers would be transported by spring 2020.
张武安表示，整个春运期间春秋航空航班量减少约60％。
Zhang said the number of flights dropped by about 60 percent throughout the Spring Festival.
春运客运量不及2019年的一半，相应带来营业收入和现金流也不及去年一半。
Chunyun passenger volume is less than half of 2019, the corresponding revenue and cash flow is less than half last year.
“现在中小航司的压力都还是挺大的，现在没有人敢说未来走向是什么。
"The pressure on small and medium-sized aircraft companies is still quite big, no one can say what the future is.
”一位地方小型航司的中层人士对《财经》记者说。
"A middle-level source with a small local shipping department told Caijing.
收入在减少，支出不会少。
Revenues are falling and spending will not be small.
航空公司仍需要按时支付飞机、设备、办公场地的租金。
Airlines are still required to pay on time for the rental of aircraft, equipment and office space.
飞机不飞还需要支付给机场停场费。
Airports are also required to pay terminal fees if the aircraft does not fly.
员工薪资仍是一项重要支出。
Employee salaries remain an important expense.
对于部分航空公司来说，短期内还能应付上述支出。
For some airlines, the above-mentioned expenditures can be met in the short term.
例如去年三季度末，国航和春秋航空还拥有76.0亿元和80.4亿元的现金余额。
At the end of last quarter, Air China and Chunqiu Airlines had cash balances of 7.60 billion yuan and 8.04 billion yuan.
普华永道航空业务服务首席顾问刘浩然告诉《财经》记者，对以往靠融资来应对日常开支的小航空公司来说，市场不景气，金融机构融资减少或者断贷，这些公司将会面临险境。
For smaller airlines that used to rely on financing to meet their daily expenses, the companies would be in jeopardy if markets faltered and financial institutions cut funding or stopped lending, Liu Haoran, PricewaterhouseCoopers' chief aviation services adviser, told Caijing.
而且中国航空公司的收入来源较为单一，主要靠机票收入来回血。
And the income source of Chinese airline is relatively single, basically rely on airfare income to return blood.
罗兰贝格管理咨询公司全球合伙人于占福对《财经》记者表示，有些航空公司进行了多元化业务拓展，但也是围绕航空业的拓展，例如进入航空配餐、航空物流领域。
Some airlines have diversified their operations, but they are also expanding around the aviation industry, such as air side meals and air logistics, said James Yu, global partner at Roland Berger Management Consulting, told Caijing.
航空业的整体不景气，将使得航空公司没有风险分散点。
The overall downturn in the airline industry will make the airline risk-free.
短期靠发债发债、降低人力成本是航空公司缓解流动性危机的显性手段在短期收入锐减的时候，谁拿到更多现金，谁将成为最后的存活者。
Short-term debt issuance and lower labor costs are the obvious way for airlines to mitigate liquidity crises. When short-term revenues plummet, who gets more cash will be the last to survive.
开源与节流成为航空公司时下的重点。
Open source and throttling have become the current focus of airlines.
发债成为多家航空公司的选择。
Bonds became an option for multiple airlines.
《财经》记者统计，自2020年1月10日起，有六家航空公司及集团发行了超短期融资券。
Since January 10, 2020, six airlines and groups have issued ultra-short-term securities, according to Caijing.
东航及东航集团发行金额最多。
China Eastern and Eastern Airlines Group issued the largest amount of money.
自2020年1月16日起，东航和东航集团共发行超短期融资券8次，规模达到170亿元。
Since January 16, 2020, China Eastern and China Eastern have issued ultra-short-term securities on eight occasions, totaling 17 billion yuan.
南航和南航集团紧随其后，共发行了124亿元的超短期融资券，发行次数达到了8次。
China Southern and China Airlines Group followed suit, issuing 12.4 billion yuan in ultra-short-term securities, with eight issues.
国航旗下的深圳航空也在靠发债过日子。
Air China's Shenzhen Airlines is also living on debt.
截至2019年6月底，深航总债务460亿元，资产负债率达到86.9％，最近三年深航的资产负债率一直维持在85％左右的高位。
By the end of June 2019, Shenzhen Airlines had a total debt of 46 billion yuan and an assets-to-liabilities ratio of 86.9%.
1月10日，深航发行了2020年度第一次超短期融资券，实际发行总额4亿元，发行利率2％，创下了2017年以来AAA评级企业发债票面利率的最低纪录。
On January 10, Shenzhen Airlines issued its first ultra-short-term securities in 2020, with a total issue of 400 million yuan and an issue rate of 2%, the lowest coupon rate for AAA-rated companies since 2017.
2月11日，深航发行首期5亿元、期限180天的超短期疫情防控债，利率为2％，为了补充疫情期间由于免费运输、免费退票而支出的运营资金。
On February 11, Shenzhen Airlines issued the first 500 million yuan, 180-day ultra-short-term epidemic prevention and control debt, at an interest rate of 2%, to supplement the operating funds spent during the epidemic due to free transportation and free ticket refunds.
2020年的头两个月内，深圳航空共发行了3期18亿元的超短期疫情防控债，此外还有3期12亿元的超短融。
In the first two months of 2020, Shenzhen Airlines issued three issues of $1.8 billion in ultra-short-term epidemic prevention and control debt, in addition to three issues of $1.2 billion in ultra-short-term financing.
深圳航空相关人士告诉《财经》记者，这是一个资金应急预案，主要是为防疫工作提供保障，目前看来这项工作还将持续。
Shenzhen Airlines told Caijing, this is a fund emergency plan, mainly to provide protection for epidemic prevention, it seems that this work will continue.
深圳航空取消了约50％的航班数量，截至1月30日，共免费提供113个航班运输防疫物资共计56吨，运输成本总计2000万元；截至2月5日，累计为旅客免费办理退票金额约5亿元。
As of January 30, 113 flights carrying epidemic prevention materials had been provided free of charge, bringing the total cost of transportation to 20 million yuan to 20 million yuan. As of February 5, a total of about 500 million yuan had been returned free of charge.
此外，四川航空和厦门航空也分别发行了超短期融资券。
In addition, Sichuan Airlines and Xiamen Airlines issued ultra-short-term securities.
春秋航空公告计划发行总额不超过50亿元的疫情债。
Chunqiu Aviation Announcement plans to issue a total of up to 5 billion yuan of epidemic debt.
银行和地方政府也是现金血源。
Banks and local governments are also a source of cash.
2月初，春秋航空只用了3天时间就拿到了工商银行提供的9亿元贷款。
In early February, Chunqiu took just three days to get a 900 million yuan loan from ICBC.
2月10日，春秋航空收到了来自上海市长宁区政府“先行兑付、材料后补”扶持资金，共计6374万元。
On February 10, Chunqiu Airlines received a total of 63.74 million yuan from the Shanghai Changning District Government's "Advance Payment and Material Repair" support fund.
《财经》记者了解到，从资金兑付立项，到最终确定方案，也只用了三天。
"Caijing" reporter learned, from the funds to pay the project, to finalize the program, also took only three days.
在金融手段外，短期维持现金流另一条直接见效的途径就是降低人力成本。
In addition to financial instruments, another immediate way to maintain cash flow in the short term is to reduce human costs.
民营航空公司大都会采用这种方法。
Private airlines have largely adopted this approach.
《财经》记者了解到，一家在中国南部边陲、有着巨额负债的大型航空公司自今年1月起，要求员工无薪轮休。
A large airline with huge debts on China's southern border has been asking its employees to take unpaid vacations since January, Caijing said.
该公司旗下子航空公司员工告诉《财经》记者，由于本公司经营情况还行，工资虽然推迟了三四天发放，但是没有像之前传言那样只发半薪。
Caijing's employees told Caijing that wages, although delayed by three or four days, were not paid half as much as previously rumoured.
春秋航空的多数干部表示，自愿在特殊时期不拿或少拿薪水，与公司共渡难关。
Most of Chunqiu's cadres said they were willing to stay with the company without or without pay during special periods.
此举无疑能帮公司减缓现金流出速度。
This will no doubt help the company slow down the outflow of cash.
于占福表示，员工是公司重要资产，不能因为短期困难而大幅度裁员。
Mr Yu said employees were important assets and could not be slashed because of short-term difficulties.
一旦疫情过去，公司运行起来还是需要大量专业员工的。
Once the epidemic is over, the company still needs a lot of professional staff to run.
目前维持劳动关系，降低薪资支出是一个选项。
Maintaining labour relations and reducing payroll costs is an option.
话虽如此，但是对于成本过高的员工，航空公司还是会挥泪斩马谡。
Having said that, the airline will still wave tears and Su to the staff who cost too much.
塔斯社报道称，海南航空计划解雇100多名俄罗斯飞行员，南航计划解雇大约10名。
Hainan Airlines plans to lay off more than 100 Russian pilots and China National plans to lay off about 10, the Tass news agency reported.
航空公司不仅会裁减俄罗斯飞行员，而且外国飞行员的编制总体上也在减少。
Not only will airlines be cutting Russian pilots, but the overall number of foreign pilots will be shrinking.
长期靠多飞只有把定期航班恢复，才能长效回血上述手段无论玩得多好，都是短期解决流动性的临时举措，对于航空公司来说，真正核心举措应该是恢复航班。
Long-term overflights are only sustainable if regular flights are resumed. No matter how well played, they are temporary short-term liquidity solutions. For airlines, the real core should be the resumption of flights.
厦门航空的工作人员对《财经》记者表示，厦门航空目前应对疫情影响的一条举措就是“保变多飞”。
Xiamen Airlines staff told Caijing that one of Xiamen's current measures to deal with the epidemic is to "change more and fly more."
所谓“保变多飞”是指在保证收回变动成本的基础上，让飞机利用率提高，多飞航班。
The so-called "guaranteed to fly more" refers to ensure the recovery of variable costs on the basis of aircraft utilization, more flights.
航空公司运营过程中有两大类成本，一是固定成本，二是变动成本。
There are two kinds of costs in airline operation, one is fixed cost and the other is variable cost.
固定成本是指在相关范围内，与业务量变动无直接因果关系的成本。
Fixed costs are those costs that do not have a direct causal relationship to changes in business volume, where relevant.
例如飞机发动机折旧费、飞机发动机大修费、员工工资福利补贴等。
For example, aircraft engine depreciation, aircraft engine overhaul fees, employee wage and welfare subsidies.
变动成本是指在相关范围内，与业务量的变动成一定比例关系的成本费用。
Variable costs are those costs that are proportional to changes in the volume of business, to the extent relevant.
例如航油消耗、航材消耗、机上配餐、起降费等等。
For example, aviation fuel consumption, aircraft consumption, aircraft meals, landing fees and so on.
瑞银证券研究部总监连沛堃告诉《财经》记者，由于航空是高投入、低现金流的行业，固定成本很高，如果要让公司短期保持现金收入，只能做包机业务。
The director of UBS's governing body You xikun has told Caijing that since aviation is a high-input, low-cash-flow industry with high fixed costs, you have to charter flights if you want your company to keep your cash income in the short term.
2月18日，南航、东航、春秋航空、吉祥航空、厦航、河北航空、北部湾航空、福州航空等各大航空公司推出了包机销售海报。
On 18 February, major airlines such as China Southern Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, Chunqiu Airlines, Lucky Airlines, Xiamen, Hebei Airlines, Beibu Gulf Airlines and Fuzhou Airlines have launched air charter sales posters.
一时间在朋友圈内刷屏，被戏称为空中版“省际包车”客源争夺战。
For a while in the circle of friends brush screen, was jokingly referred to as the aerial version of "inter-provincial charter" customers contend.
就在同日，春秋航空执飞湖州市首个复工包机。
On the same day, Chunqiu Airways flew the first resumed charter flight to Huzhou.
约180名云南籍工人登上春秋航空昆明至上海包机，落地后再由7辆大巴转运至湖州。
About 180 workers from Yunnan boarded a charter flight from Kunming to Shanghai in the Spring and Autumn period and were then transferred to Huzhou by seven buses.
张武安透露，春秋航空的复工包机主要是从西部到东部，比如云南、贵州、四川、甘肃等这些劳动力输出大省，到东部浙江、江苏一带劳动力密集型产业集群的地方。
Zhang said that Chunqiu Airways resumed charter flights from the west to the east, such as Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan and Gansu, which are major labor-exporting provinces, to the east of Zhejiang and Jiangsu, where labor-intensive industrial clusters are located.
春秋航空还增开了兰州、成都到东部的航班。
Chunqiu Airlines also opened Lanzhou, Chengdu to the east of the flight.
2月24日，东航一架载有160名世邦集团员工的飞机从郑州飞往上海。
On February 24, a plane carrying 160 employees of the World Bank Group flew from Zhengzhou to Shanghai.
“第一次坐飞机回上海返工的感觉挺好。
"It felt good to fly back to Shanghai for the first time.
”世邦工业科技集团股份有限公司（下称“世邦集团”）员工吴文超告诉《财经》记者。
Wu Wenchao, an employee of the World Bank Industrial Technology Group Co., Ltd. told Caijing.
不仅员工感觉挺好，企业和航司也乐见其成。
Not only did the staff feel good, but the company and the shipping department were pleased to see it happen.
在全国企业逐步复工复产的大背景下，如何将分散在外地的员工安全接回工作地成为企业的一大难题。
Under the background of national enterprises returning to work, how to take back the scattered employees safely becomes a difficult problem for enterprises.
世邦集团常务副总经理方立波对《财经》记者说，世邦集团考虑了火车、大巴、飞机等多种方案，最终在预算可控的情况下，选择了飞机。
Fang Libo, managing director of the World Bank Group, told Caijing that the group considered various options, including trains, buses and airplanes, and eventually chose them under controlled budgets.
因为飞机运输速度快，而且全流程安全可控。
Because the aircraft transportation speed is fast, and the whole process security is controllable.
包机成本上，方立波透露，比高铁贵了一倍，超出大巴运输50％－60％。
On charter costs, Fang revealed that it was twice as expensive as high-speed rail and 50-60 per cent more than the bus.
整体运输成本符合预期，而且东航提供了优惠价格，这个价格低于市场价。
Overall transport costs were in line with expectations, and China Eastern offered preferential prices, which were below market rates.
对航空公司来说，复工包机不仅是履行社会责任的好机会，同样也是减亏的好举措。
For airlines, the resumption of charter flights is not only a good opportunity to fulfill social responsibility, but also a good way to reduce losses.
东航营销委副总经理沈劲军告诉《财经》记者，现阶段东航复工包机的最低人数标准很低，因此多数的复工包机都是低于运营成本执行的。
Shen Jingjun, vice-general manager of the China Eastern Airlines Marketing Committee, told Caijing that the minimum number of charter flights is low at this stage, so most of the resumed charter flights are below operating costs.
东航首先考虑的不是经济账，而是央企的社会责任账。
China Eastern is not the first consideration of economic accounts, but the social responsibility of the central enterprises.
截至2月27日，东航共收到包机需求近100班。
As at 27 February, China Eastern had received almost 100 charter flights.
在张武安看来，包机业务带不来太大量的现金流，现金流主要靠定期航班的恢复。
In Zhang's view, the charter business does not bring too much cash flow, which mainly depends on the resumption of regular flights.
民航业正在逐步复苏。
Civil aviation is gradually recovering.
飞友科技的数据显示，2月25日全国累计取消航班8005架次，取消率62.91％，取消比例达近一周最低值；飞机利用率2.11小时/天，日利用率较前一日提高1.93％。
According to Feifei technology, 8,005 flights were cancelled nationwide on February 25, a cancellation rate of 62.91 per cent, the lowest rate in nearly a week, and an aircraft utilization rate of 2.11 hours per day, an increase of 1.93 per cent over the previous day.
航空公司执行率也在提高。
Airline enforcement rates are also increasing.
2月25日，四川航空、厦航、国航、南航航班执行率为68.2％、56.8％、46.5％、28.4％，较前一天分别提高了8％、0.9％、2.8％、2.1％。
On February 25, Sichuan Airlines, Xiamen, Air China and China Southern Airlines implemented 68.2 percent, 56.8 percent, 46.5 percent and 28.4 percent, up 8 percent, 0.9 percent, 2.8 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively, on the previous day.
内地航空公司2月25日总体航班执行率较前一日增长3.78％。
The overall performance rate of Mainland airlines on 25 February was 3.78 per cent higher than the previous day.
像春秋航空、吉祥航空这样的民营航空公司更是打出价格牌，来吸引客源。
Such as Chunqiu Airlines, lucky air such as private airlines are playing the price card to attract customers.
在上海交通大学医学院读大五的陈力2月25日发现，当日上海飞成都的最低票价为80元，承运人为成都航空。
Chen Li, a senior at Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, found on Feb. 25 that the lowest fare for a flight to Chengdu was 80 yuan, with Chengdu Airlines as the carrier.
除此之外，吉祥航空、春秋航空也推出了不足150元的上海飞成都的机票。
In addition, auspicious aviation, Chunqiu aviation also launched less than 150 yuan of Shanghai to Chengdu flight tickets.
陈力告诉《财经》记者，通常非旺季时，上海-成都之间机票都要在800元以上，“没想到今年只要80元。
Chen Li told Caijing that air tickets between Shanghai and Chengdu usually cost more than 800 yuan in the non-peak season.
”不过这只是上海飞成都单程机票的价格。
But that's the price of a one-way ticket to Chengdu in Shanghai.
作为复工返程的热门线路，成都飞上海的票价就没有那么便宜了，各航空公司给出的价格都在千元以上。
Flying to Shanghai from Chengdu, a popular route back to work, is not so cheap, with airlines offering prices in the thousands or more.
民航专家林智杰告诉《财经》记者，航班票价受到航空公司经营方针、航班客座率影响。
Aviation expert Lin Zhijie told Caijing that airline ticket prices are affected by the airline's operating policy, flight attendance.
但是无论票价怎么变动，正常情况下，只有航班收入能够覆盖变动成本，航空公司才会飞。
But no matter how the fare changes, airlines normally fly only if their revenues cover the variable costs.
非典模型会再现吗V型模式会不会再出现，要取决于整体经济发展，目前看很难航班量逐步在恢复，但开年的日子依旧难过，中国民航业希望，能再度复制2003年非典疫情后的报复性反弹。
Whether the SARS model will reappear depends on the overall economic development, it is difficult to see the gradual resumption of flights, but the opening day is still sad, China's civil aviation industry hopes to repeat the 2003 SARS epidemic after the retaliatory rebound.
2003年第二季度，在非典疫情最为严重的时刻，中国民航业遭遇剧烈冲击。
In the second quarter of 2003, at the height of the SARS epidemic, China's civil aviation industry was hit hard.
当年4月，中国民航运送旅客573万人次，同比下降25.6％；5月，运送旅客163万人次，同比下降77.9％，主要疫区广州白云机场和北京首都机场吞吐量分别下降81.4％和86.5％。
In April of that year, CAAC transported 5.73 million passengers, a 25.6 percent decrease year-on-year; in May, it transported 1.63 million passengers, a decrease of 77.9 percent year on year.
6月末，世界卫生组织将北京从疫区名单中删除，非典疫情基本得到控制，当月旅客运输量达到315万人次，较5月翻番。
In late June, the World Health Organization removed Beijing from the list of affected areas, and the SARS epidemic was basically brought under control.
随后下半年，旅客运输量更是急速上升，比上一年分别增长20.1％和14.3％。
Passenger traffic increased even faster in the second half of the year, by 20.1 per cent and 14.3 per cent, respectively.
尽管二季度运量下滑一半，但单靠下半年的强劲表现，2003年全年中国民航还是实现正向增长：完成旅客运输量8759万人，同比增长1.9％。
Despite a halving of traffic volume in the second quarter, CAAC recorded positive growth throughout 2003, thanks to strong performance in the second half of the year: 87.59 million passengers completed, an increase of 1.9 per cent year on year.
但在民航业规模翻了几倍的2020年，这样的逆风翻盘不再可期。
But in 2020, when civil aviation has doubled in size, such headwinds are no longer expected.
2003年，中国民航处于高速发展阶段，此前三年的旅客运输量增速分别为10.3％、11.9％、14.2％，如没有疫情影响，业内普遍预计2003年增速在12％以上。
In 2003, Air China was in a phase of rapid growth, with passenger traffic increasing by 10.3%, 11.9% and 14.2% in the previous three years.
经过多年高速发展，民航业2019年以来已进入中速发展阶段，加之受中美经贸摩擦、地缘政治等因素影响，2019年旅客运输量增速降为7.9％，如果保持正常经营，预计2020年增速只在7％左右。
After years of high-speed development, the civil aviation industry has entered a medium-speed development stage since 2019, which, combined with China-US economic and trade frictions and geopolitical factors, has reduced passenger traffic growth to 7.9 per cent in 2019, and is expected to grow by only about 7 per cent in 2020 if normal business is maintained.
十七年前的上升势头已不再，瑞银证券预计，假设疫情于今年7月之前结束，2020年全年需求同比下跌10％。
The upward momentum of 17 years ago is over, and UBS Securities expects demand to fall by 10% year-on-year in 2020, assuming the epidemic ends by July.
同时，新冠肺炎疫情比非典疫情对民航业的影响更大。
At the same time, New Crown Pneumonia epidemic than SARS epidemic on the civil aviation industry greater impact.
2003年非典疫情顶峰出现在二季度，而二季度向来是民航淡季，此前民航已吃到春运红利，也享受了疫情过后的暑运高峰。
The peak of the SARS epidemic in 2003 occurred in the second quarter, which was traditionally a low season for civil aviation, which had already received a spring dividend and enjoyed the peak of the summer season following the outbreak.
2020年的新冠肺炎疫情暴发更早，1月23日疫区武汉“封城”后，全国多个省份陆续启动一级响应，国内航班大幅缩减，国际航线也大面积停飞。
The outbreak of new crown pneumonia in 2020 was even earlier, with many provinces across the country responding to the "closure" of Wuhan on January 23, with a sharp reduction in domestic flights and a massive suspension of international flights.
航空公司不仅失去了春运高峰，疫情影响甚至可能延续到“五一”长假，希望只在7、8月份的暑运旺季。
Airlines not only lost the peak of the Spring Festival, the epidemic may even extend into the May Day holiday, the hope is only in July and August during the summer season.
刘浩然认为，此次新冠肺炎疫情造成的影响远超非典时期。
Liu Haoran believes that the new crown pneumonia outbreak caused by the impact of far more than the SARS period.
非典时期，只是北京、广东、香港等局部地区有影响。
During the SARS period, only Beijing, Guangdong and Hong Kong were affected.
受影响的航司区域性特征明显。
The regional characteristics of the affected shipping department are obvious.
而此次新冠肺炎疫情影响了全国乃至全球航空业。
And the outbreak of new crown pneumonia affected the national and global aviation industry.
国际航空运输协会（下称“国际航协”）对新冠肺炎疫情暴发对航空运输业影响的初步评估报告显示，亚太地区航空公司年客运需求或将下降13％。
A preliminary assessment by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) of the impact of the outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia on the air transport industry suggests that annual passenger demand from Asia-Pacific airlines may decline by 13 per cent.
此前，国际航协曾预计亚太地区航空公司客运量将增长4.8％。
Earlier, IATA had forecast 4.8 per cent growth in air traffic in the Asia-Pacific region.
但因疫情影响，该地区航司全年客运需求同比将下降8.2％。
But year-on-year passenger demand in the region is set to fall 8.2 per cent year-on-year because of the epidemic.
以此估算，2020年，亚太地区航空公司或将损失278亿美元收入，其中大部分损失来自中国航空公司，中国国内客运市场的损失或将达128亿美元。
That could cost Asia-Pacific airlines $27.8 billion in lost revenue in 2020, most of it from Chinese airlines, and $12.8 billion in domestic passenger-transport losses.
假设需求损失仅限于与中国相关的市场，亚太地区以外的航空公司收入损失将达15亿美元，全球航空公司总收入预估将损失293亿美元，客运需求下降4.7％。
Assuming that demand losses are limited to China-related markets, airlines outside the Asia-Pacific region would lose $1.5 billion in revenue, global airline revenues would be estimated to lose $29.3 billion and passenger demand would fall by 4.7 per cent.
上述预估结果的前提是基于新冠病毒与非典V型模型类似。
These estimates are based on the premise that the new crown virus is similar to the SARS V model.
非典疫情下航空业的特点是6个月内急剧下降，随后又迅速恢复。
The airline industry was characterized by a sharp decline in six months, followed by a rapid recovery.
2003年，非典致亚太地区航空公司客运收入客公里下降5.1％。
In 2003, SARS brought down 5.1 per cent of passenger revenue to airlines in the Asia-Pacific region.
国际航协理事长兼首席执行官亚历山大·德·朱尼亚克（Alexandre de Juniac）表示，对于全球航空运输业而言，这段时间充满挑战。
Alexandre de Juniac, IATA's president and chief executive, said this was a challenging time for the global air transport industry.
当务之急是阻止病毒传播。
Preventing the virus from spreading is imperative.
新冠病毒将致客运总需求出现自2008年－2009年全球金融危机爆发以来的首次下降。
The new cap virus will cause aggregate passenger demand to fall for the first time since the global financial crisis erupted in 2008-2009.
“今年对于航空公司而言将十分艰难”。
"It's going to be a tough year for airlines."
去哪儿网副总裁兰翔在接受《财经》记者采访时表示，旅游业恢复信心起码要在疫情结束后1个月左右。
At least a month after the outbreak, tourism should regain confidence, 'Lan Xiang, vice president of the Web site, told Caijing.
虽然现在很多旅客取消出行，但很多旅客对航班的搜索量没有降低。
Although many passengers are now canceled travel, many passengers on the flight search volume has not decreased.
由此可以看出，很多旅客的出行需求还没有释放，这部分可能都是刚需出行旅客，需要返程工作或者必须出差的人群。
As can be seen, many of the passengers' travel needs have not yet been released, which may be part of the new need to travel, return to work or have to travel.
至少有 800 万人次民航返程需求等待释放。
At least 8 million civil aviation return flights are pending release.
今年中国航空业的冬天将变得漫长。
China's aviation industry will have a long winter this year.
但是，漫长的冬天之中仍有希望。
But there is still hope in the long winter.
