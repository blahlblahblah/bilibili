燃财经（ID:rancaijing）原创作者 | 黎明编辑 | 阿伦2月中旬，有商家举报，美团外卖存在突然提高佣金、垄断经营及不正当竞争两方面问题。
Flaming Finance (ID: Rancaijing) Former founder and dawn editor & # 44; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45
重庆、四川、河北、云南等地多家协会，纷纷公开呼吁美团等外卖平台降低佣金。
Chongqing, Sichuan, Hebei, Yunnan and other places in a number of associations have openly called on the United States Mission and other delivery platforms to reduce commissions.
疫情期间，堂食关闭，外卖成为餐饮行业的救命稻草。
During the outbreak, the parlour closed, take-out food industry has become a lifesaver.
试图从线下转到线上的商家们，却无奈地发现，外卖的生意并不好做。
Trying to switch from offline to online businesses, but reluctantly found that take-out business is not easy to do.
佣金费率过高，是外卖最大的难点。
The commission rate is too high and is the biggest difficulty in take-out.
费率的高低，跟外卖业务的生死线直接挂钩，每提高一个点，意味着商家的收入减少一个点。
Rates are directly linked to the life and death of the take-out business, and each increase means a one-point drop in business income.
而在去年底，就有商家接到美团外卖的通知，要将其外卖佣金，从16%提高到21%。
By the end of last year, businesses had been notified of take-out orders to increase their take-out commissions from 16 per cent to 21 per cent.
同时，晚上9点之后，除了固定配送费，还要增加一笔额外费用。
At the same time, after 9 p.m., in addition to the fixed delivery fee, there will be an additional charge.
新政策下，一些商家几乎无利可赚。
Under the new policy, some businesses have little to gain.
有商家调高外卖价格，却发现订单量随之减少，于是在美团外卖App做广告投放，以挽回丢失的订单。
Some vendors raised take-out prices and found that orders fell, so they placed ads at App, the American Troupe takeout, to make up for lost orders.
最后一算账，发现还是不赚钱。
In the final reckoning, I still don't make money.
对于商家的举报，美团并未正式回应。
The company did not respond formally to reports from businesses.
2月底，美团将此前推出的“春风行动”升级，将为武汉外卖商户免除1个月佣金、延长2个月年费的政策时间，又延长了1个月，并将范围扩大至湖北省。
At the end of February, the US team upgraded its previous "Operation Spring Wind," extending the policy of waiving one-month commission and extending the two-month annual fee to Wuhan take-out merchants by one month and extending it to Hubei Province.
然而，即便已经将部分地区的佣金费率提升至20%，美团的日子也并不好过。
But even if the commission rate in some areas has been raised to 20 per cent, the tour has had a rough time.
从2013年至今，美团外卖连续亏损了五年，直到2019年二季度，美团外卖才在经营层面扭亏。
From 2013 to the present, American Tours have been losing money for five consecutive years until the second quarter of 2019, when American take-out began to lose business.
2018年，它向270万美团骑手，支付了305亿元。
In 2018, it paid 30.5 billion yuan to 2.7 million American riders.
刚盈利不到半年，就赶上了疫情的黑天鹅，美团外卖或再次陷入亏损泥沼。
Just less than half a year profit, caught up with the epidemic of black swans, the United States Mission to sell or once again plunged into loss.
一面是上市后的盈利压力，另一面是疫情之下中小商家的联合抵抗。
On the one hand is the post-listed profit pressure, on the other side of the epidemic under the joint resistance of small and medium-sized businesses.
围绕佣金这件事，美团外卖正面临两难局面。
The American take-out is facing a dilemma over the commission.
美团的打包式“抽佣”“疫情前佣金涨了5个点，现在外卖最难的就是佣金高。
The package commission for the U.S. Mission has gone up by five points before the outbreak. The hardest thing to do now is the high commission rate.
”广州一家入驻了美团外卖的快餐店老板丁晟说。
"said Shengong Ding, owner of a fast-food restaurant in Guangzhou that has taken out American food.
从去年开始，丁晟发现外卖越来越难做了。
Since last year, Sheng Ding has found take-out increasingly difficult.
一方面线下实体店的房租人工等运营成本上涨，同时外卖平台的抽佣也越来越高。
On the one hand, off-line entity shop rental labor and other operating costs rise, while take-out platform of the commission is increasingly high.
丁晟介绍，按照地区不同，美团的抽佣分为流水抽佣和菜品抽佣，也可以分为应收抽佣和实付抽佣。
According to Ding Sheng, according to the region, the commission is divided into flowing commission and food product commission, as well as commission receivable and paid commission.
抽佣方法大同小异，都是乘以一个固定的费率。
The method of pumping is much the same, multiplying by a fixed rate.
问题在于，这个佣金费率，正在逐年上涨。
The problem is that the commission rate is increasing year by year.
从最初的8%，到2018年前后的16%，到现在部分地区高达20%，美团外卖的佣金费率，已经触达到一些中小商户的盈亏线。
From an initial 8 per cent to around 16 per cent by 2018 and up to 20 per cent in some parts of the world, the commission rate for take-out has touched the profit and loss lines of some small and medium-sized businesses.
而美团外卖的商业变现率，则从2017年的12%，提升至2019年的14%。
The commercial liquidity of American take-out sales rose from 12 per cent in 2017 to 14 per cent in 2019.
这意味着，每一笔100元的订单，美团外卖要抽取14元。
That means $14 is charged for each $100 order.
佣金费率上涨只是一方面，收费的项目也在增加。
The increase in the commission rate is only one thing and the number of items charged is increasing.
北京一家餐饮连锁品牌同时入驻了美团和饿了么，都是16%的佣金费率。
Is a Beijing restaurant chain both in the U. S. and hungry, with a commission rate of 16%?
在美团外卖，它的抽佣方式是以折扣后的实付金额为基数，乘以16%的抽佣率，保底抽佣5元。
In American take-out, the rebate is based on a discounted cash payment, multiplied by a 16% commission rate and a $5 rebate.
凭借品牌优势，过去一年它的抽佣率并未上调。
It has not increased its commissions over the past year on the strength of its brand.
但从去年底开始，当地的美团市场经理开始推荐“扩商圈”的政策，配送范围扩大，但需要额外付费。
But since the end of last year, local tour managers have been recommending a "business-to-business" policy, expanding distribution but requiring extra fees.
“扩商圈意味着要增加抽佣，我们单笔订单的配送成本增加了。
"The expansion circle means more commission, and the cost of distribution of our single order has increased.
”负责人柳钲说。
"said Liu Zou.
他发现，之前出现恶劣天气，平台会缩小配送范围，他给平台打报告可以申请扩大商圈，配送费并不会上涨，但现在则必须增加付费。
He found that the platform would be smaller in the face of bad weather, and he reported to the platform that he could apply to expand the business circle and that the distribution fee would not rise, but would now have to pay more.

Graphic / Visual ChinaBeyond that, platform subsidies, which were used to in the past, are declining.
“去年最大的感受就是免费资源大大减少了，不论是配送补贴，还是广告资源，全部都要付费。
"The biggest feeling over the last year was that free resources, whether distribution subsidies or advertising resources, have been drastically reduced.
”柳钲说。
"said Liu.
过去他还可以凭借跟美团市场经理混得熟，拿到一些免费拉升排名的资源，但“现在就是你必须拿钱去玩”。
In the past, he could get some free promotion rankings by getting used to working with tour managers, but "it's time you took the money to play."
在美团外卖，商家可以购买首页广告位和排名。
In American Troupe take-out, businesses can buy home page ads and rankings.
丁晟发现，购买排名后，有时候单日的订单可以增加一倍，但一旦广告预算降下来，订单量立马缩减。
Sheng Ding has found that buying a ranking can sometimes double orders a day, but once the advertising budget falls, orders shrink.
去年下半年，美团年度活跃商家数量达到590万，日订单量超过3000万单。
In the second half of last year, it had 5.9 million active businesses and more than 30 million orders a day.
在这样的体量下，抽佣已经不再是平台的唯一变现方式。
Under such a volume, the commission is no longer the platform's only means of realization.
“现在美团和饿了么很聪明，不完全在抽佣上做文章，因为抽佣是盯着一根骨头挣钱，这样会让很多商家寒心，大家都挣不到钱，所以他们会用别的方式。
'Is it clever to be hungry now? Not exactly on the commissions, because they're staring at a bone to make money, which would make a lot of businesses cold, so they won't make money, so they'll use other methods.
”柳钲说。
"said Liu.
在抽佣之外，以配送、营销、数据等为代表的增值服务被打包，平台衍生出更多的变现渠道。
In addition to the commission, the value-added services represented by distribution, marketing, data, etc., are packaged, and the platform gives rise to more liquidity channels.
柳钲做了一个比喻，“这就像你是房东，你隔一段时间都来给我涨一次房租，我肯定不乐意，但是你可以从别的方面下手，比如给我们把暖气改造一下，把电路更新一下，把家具翻新一下。
"Liu said in a parable," It's like that you are the landlord. You come to pay a rent for me every once in a while.
当然，这些都是要收费的。
Of course, they are all for a fee.
”挤出来的利润提升抽佣费率，是为了弥补业务亏损。
The squeeze on profits raises commission rates to cover business losses.
在过去的五年里，美团累计亏损了近200亿元，直到2019年二季度，美团才首次盈利。
The group lost nearly $20 billion in the past five years, before making its first profit in the second quarter of 2019.
餐饮外卖、到店酒旅、单车等新业务，是美团的三大业务模块。
Restaurant take-out, to the shop liquor travel, bicycle and other new business, is the three business modules of the United States Mission.
其中外卖是基本盘，贡献了超过一半的GMV和营收。
Among them take-out is the basic dish, contributing more than half of the GMV and revenue.
但外卖业务长期亏损，骑手是最大成本项。
But for long-term losses in the take-out business, riders are the biggest cost item.
根据美团财报，我们可以推算这样一笔账。
According to the results of the American Troupe, we can calculate such an account.
一笔实付45元（美团2019年Q3平均外卖客单价为45元）的外卖订单，在20%的佣金费率下，美团抽佣9元。
A lump sum of $45 (US Mission Q3 average take-out customer unit price of $45 in 2019) and a commission rate of 20% of $9 for the US Mission.
但这9元的佣金，美团要拿出约7元给骑手，剩下的2元要拿来分摊服务器、研发、营销等各种费用。
But the 9 yuan commission, the United States Mission to put out about 7 yuan to the rider, the remaining 2 yuan to share the server, research and development, marketing and other expenses.
扣完这些剩下的钱，才是美团能拿到的利润。
Deductions these remaining money, is the American group can obtain the profit.
美团外卖的毛利率过去一直低于20%，而大部分实体餐饮的毛利率为60%左右。
Gross margins on take-out have been below 20% in the past, compared with around 60% in most entities.
美团外卖收入和毛利率 制图 / 燃财经从2015年到2018年，美团每年向骑手支付的费用分别为2.8亿、51.4亿、183.2亿、305.2亿，其中基本都是支付给美团专送，少部分是支付给外包劳务。
From 2015 to 2018, the US Mission will pay US $280 million, US $5.14 billion, US $18.32 billion and US $30.52 billion per year, all of which will be paid to the US Mission and, to a lesser extent, to outsourced services.
目前，美团外卖平台上活跃着超过300万骑手，疫情期间，美团外卖配送平台又新招聘7.5万骑手。
More than 3 million riders are currently active on American takeaway platforms, and 75,000 new riders were recruited during the epidemic.
就像京东一样，美团自建配送体系，这套庞大而繁琐的基础设施，保障了美团外卖的配送效率和服务体验，但同时也成为最大的成本项，拖累了财报利润。
Like Jingdong, the US Mission builds and distributes its own system, a huge and cumbersome infrastructure that guarantees delivery efficiency and service experience, but also becomes the biggest cost item and a drag on profit-making.
外卖配送还会受到天气的影响。
Delivery can also be affected by the weather.
在雨雪等极端天气环境下，美团需要启用大量的补贴，激励骑手去接单，才能完成配送任务。
In extreme weather conditions, such as rain and snow, the group needs to use massive subsidies to motivate riders to take orders to complete distribution tasks.
在这样的季节，美团外卖的亏损会进一步扩大。
Losses on American take-out are likely to widen in such a season.
事实上，美团外卖历史上第一次扭亏，是在2019年二季度，一定程度上也是受益于有利的天气。
Indeed, for the first time in American take-out history, it was in the second quarter of 2019, helped in part by favourable weather.
外卖业务的盈利，导致美团公司在二季度正式扭亏为盈。
The profitability of the take-out business led to a formal turnaround in the second quarter.
提高佣金费率是加速变现的最有效手段。
Higher commission rates are the most effective means of accelerating liquidity.
美团在2018年赴港上市，那一年美团外卖的佣金费率进行了一次大范围的调整，很多商家从15%的费率涨到20%，有的甚至从20%涨到26%。
The US group went public in 2018, when the commission rate for US take-out packages was overhauled, with many businesses increasing from 15 per cent to 20 per cent or even from 20 per cent to 26 per cent.
商家因此不堪重负。
Businesses are overburdened.
在业内人士看来，外卖行业还未到收割变现的时候。
In the industry's view, the take-out industry is not ready to harvest cash.
一方面平台对商家侧的数字化改造还有很大空间，另一方面美团和饿了么的外卖大战未结束。
On the one hand, the platform to the business side of the digital transformation is still a lot of room, on the other hand the U. S. and hungry take-out war is not over.
从提高佣金费率挤出来的利润，对于美团的大盘而言毕竟是杯水车薪。
Squeezing profits out of higher commission rates is, after all, a small price to pay for the U. S. market.
美团在讲的是一个规模经济的故事。
The tour is about a story of economies of scale.
它的内在逻辑是，通过扩大规模优化运营，提高接单和配送的密度，将平台的边际成本降到最低；同时向平台导入生鲜酒旅等低频但高毛利的产品和服务，以高频带低频，提高整体变现率。
Its built-in logic is to minimize the marginal cost of platforms by increasing the scale of operations and increasing the density of orders and distribution; and to introduce low-frequency but high-margin products and services, such as fresh wineries, to the platform, with high frequency bands and low frequency to increase overall liquidity.
所以无论是做买菜，推无人配送，还是将美团配送独立，美团其实都是在为这个脚本做注脚。
So whether it's shopping, pushing and delivering, or delivering independent U. S. missions, the U. S. Mission is actually writing footnotes to the script.
而美团如今能够盈利的根本原因，也正是因为这一点。
That is why the US mission is now profitable.
规模经济的另一面是规模不经济。
Another aspect of economies of scale is diseconomies of scale.
也就是说，如果订单密度不够，那么作为平台方的美团，就要为之垫付昂贵的成本。
In other words, if the order density is not enough, then as a platform party, the United States will have to pay a high cost.
这也是为什么美团外卖会向商家要保底抽佣，因为一笔10元的订单，美团肯定是亏的。
That's why American take-out stores ask retailers for a rebate, since a $10 order is a sure way to lose.
时至今日，低毛利的外卖业务依然是美团最核心的业务。
Today, the low-margin take-out business remains at the heart of the business.
虽然这家公司一向以无边界著称，在外卖之外，它还有团购、酒旅、金融，甚至共享单车和网约车业务，但这些都是在外卖之外延伸出的新业务。
While the company has long been known for its borderless takeout, it also has group buying, liquor travel, finance, and even shared bike and netcar businesses, these are new businesses that extend beyond take-out.
美团各业务模块的毛利率制图 / 燃财经到店和酒旅有高达88%的毛利率，但对营收的贡献只有20%；五花八门的新业务，虽然增长迅猛，但毛利率比外卖还低，且大部分还处于亏损状态。
Gross margin charting / combustible finance and finance to stores and liquor stores is as high as 88 per cent, but only 20 per cent of revenues. New businesses are diverse, growing rapidly, but gross margins are lower than take-out and most of them are still in deficit.
外卖的地位不可动摇，意味着配送作为基础设施的作用不可动摇。
The unshakeable status of take-out means that distribution's role as an infrastructure is unshakable.
这是一个短期无解的矛盾体。
This is a short-term paradox.
“美团的盈利不可能只靠提高佣金，但短期又找不到更便捷的途径。
"We can't make money by raising commissions, but we can't find a more convenient way in the short term.
从长远来看，还是要靠规模效应和新业务的进展。
In the long run, it depends on economies of scale and the development of new businesses.
”一位投资人说。
'said one investor.
捆绑与反捆绑“我们不应该把注意力放在佣金上，而应该更多关注平台的控制力和话语权。
"Instead of focusing on commission, we should focus more on the control and voice of the platform.
”柳钲说。
"said Liu.
一个让人担忧的信号是，美团外卖正愈发强势。
One worrying sign is that American take-out is getting stronger.
据Trustdata发布的《2019年Q3中国外卖行业发展分析报告》显示，2019年第三季度，美团外卖交易额占比达到65.8%，远超对手饿了么。
According to Trustdata's 2019 analysis of the development of the Q3 Chinese take-out industry, the U.S. accounted for 65.8% of take-out sales in the third quarter of 2019, far outstripping rivals' hunger.
在今年2月商家对美团的举报中，有170多家会员单位的南充火锅协会认为美团存在垄断经营的问题。
In February of this year, more than 170 members of the Nanchong Hotpot Association believed that the United States Mission has a monopoly.
从市场份额来看，目前中国的外卖格局尚谈不上垄断。
From the market share, the current Chinese take-out pattern is not a monopoly.
但一个显而易见的事实是，不论美团外卖还是饿了么，现在都将目光盯在了供给侧，试图通过各种手段，将商家牢牢绑定在自己的平台上。
But the obvious truth is that, whether American takeaway or hungry, they are now focused on the supply side, trying to bind businesses to their platforms by a variety of means.
二选一是行业正常现象。
The second option is the normal industry phenomenon.
美团和饿了么都会对商户进行分级，根据品牌、规模、诚信度等维度，将商户区分为战略合作商户和普通商户，并给与不同的佣金费率，独家商户会获得更多的资源倾斜。
According to the dimensions of brand, scale and honesty, the business households will be divided into strategic cooperative merchants and ordinary merchants, and will be given different commission rates.
平台方总会给出一些让人难以拒绝、却又无法接受的条件。
Platforms always offer conditions that are difficult to refuse but unacceptable.
柳钲透露，美团的市场经理曾多次劝她签独家，并口头承诺只要签独家，未来可以保证佣金费率不涨。
Liu revealed that the marketing manager of the US Mission had repeatedly advised her to sign an exclusive contract and verbally promised that the commission rate would not rise in the future as long as she signed a single contract.
饿了么的市场经理对她表示，可以提供一笔大额贷款，前提是签独家，并要有一定额度的包销。
Hungry marketing manager to her, can provide a large loan, on the premise of exclusive, and a certain amount of underwriting.
作为当地的品牌商户，柳钲感受到了两大平台的示好和拉拢，但这同时引起了她的警惕：跟任何一方签独家，都会得罪另外一方。
As a local brand merchant, Liu felt the beauty and closeness of the two platforms, but it also caused her vigilance that signing an exclusive contract with either party would offend the other side.
“会被另一方封杀，比如你的店铺用户搜不到。
"Will be blocked by the other side, such as your store users can not search.
签独家的风险太大。
The risk of signing exclusivity is too great.
”柳钲知道不能跟平台绑定的太紧密，因为客户资源和订单都是掌握在平台手里。
"Ms. Liu knew that she could not bind herself too closely to the platform because client resources and orders were all in the hands of the platform.
他拒绝了独家，却无法拒绝任何一个平台的配送。
He refused exclusivity, but could not refuse delivery of any platform.
在配送方式上，商家可以选择平台专送、自配送、众包配送。
In the mode of distribution, businesses can choose platform delivery, self-distribution, crowd-sourcing delivery.
为了减少对平台的依赖，赚这一份配送费，柳钲尝试过自己配送，但人手不够，订单多的时候根本忙不过来，众包配送单量太小，价格谈不下来。
In order to reduce the reliance on the platform, earned this share of delivery fees, Liu Gong tried to deliver himself, but not enough manpower, orders when the work is simply too busy, the volume of delivery orders too small, prices can not be negotiated.
总之都不如平台专送划算。
In any case, less cost-effective than platform delivery.
一位外卖代运营的人士告诉燃财经，外卖平台主推的是专送，如果商家自建物流，平台会给商家降权，权重的排名是：专送＞众包＞自配送。
A take-out agent tells Flaming Finance that the main delivery platform is delivery, if businesses build their own logistics, the platform will give merchants the right to health, the weight of the ranking is: exclusive > crowd-sourcing > distribution.
美团在去年5月将美团配送独立，次月饿了么将旗下蜂鸟独立，两大平台都已经开放同城即配的物流运力，在规模化的基础上具备了基础设施的功能。
The US mission became independent in May, and when it became hungry next month, both platforms have opened up to the city's ready-to-use logistics capacity, providing infrastructure on a large scale.
“就像水电一样，你不可能自己去建了，只能用人家的。
"" Like water and electricity, you can't build it yourself -- you can only use it.
”柳钲说。
"said Liu.
美团和饿了么大肆宣扬的数字化升级，的确让柳甄感受到了技术带来的效率提升——过去因配送延时导致的赔付，现在可以机器自动发起，不再需要人工。
The much-touted digital upgrade between the US Mission and Hungry Zhen did indeed allow Zhen to feel the efficiency gains brought about by the technology - payments made in the past due to delayed distribution can now be automatically initiated by the machine and no longer require manual labor.
美团的工作人工甚至给她推销pos机，除此之外还有快驴的进货系统，方方面面平台都考虑到了。
The crew even sold her the pos, in addition to the fast-ass feed system, which was considered on every platform.
但这个时候，她却开始担忧：“当我把这些机器全都装上，未来我还换的掉吗？”作为600万商家中的一员，竞争加剧是实实在在的。
But then she began to worry: "When I put all these machines on, will I swap them for the future?" As one of the six million businesses, the increased competition is real.
以广告投放为例，丁晟的美团店铺，一个月需要一万元的广告费用，而且“不买排名就订单量非常少，这已经成为一笔固定开支。
To take advertising for example, Sheng Ding's beauty group stores, a month to $10,000 advertising expenses, and "do not buy the rank of very small orders, this has become a fixed expenditure.
”广告费用的增长，是美团希望看到的，这是比抽佣更健康的盈利模型。
The increase in advertising costs, which the US group would like to see, is a healthier profit model than flippers.
美团各业务收入增速制图 / 燃财经美团的在线营销服务收入，从2018年一季度的15亿元，一直上涨至2019年三季度的44亿元，几乎翻了三倍，速度远高于佣金的增长。
Revenues from online marketing services of the US Mission have almost tripled from 1.5 billion yuan in the first quarter of 2018 to 4.4 billion yuan in the third quarter of 2019, far faster than the increase in commissions.
一位投资人认为，“对于商家而言，抽佣毕竟是被动的，但买广告是主动的，而且效果可以在数据上直接体现，商家当然更愿意接受。
"After all, the commission is passive for businesses," says one investor. "But buying advertising is proactive, and the results can be directly reflected in the data, which businesses are naturally more receptive to.
”平台的掌控力在不断加强，商家对平台的依赖也在不断加深。
The platform's grip continues to grow, and businesses are becoming more reliant on it.
“美团跟饿了么是越来越狠了，总体而言我们的利润打薄了很多。
"It's getting harder and harder to be nice and hungry, and overall our profits are much thinner.
”一位山东的快餐店老板对燃财经说。
"said a Shandong fast food restaurant owner to Flaming Finance.
但是他选择继续做美团外卖。
But he chose to keep on doing take-out.
因为，外卖的利润虽然薄，但在堂食基础上做了增量，是额外多赚的钱。
Because, although the profit of take-out is thin, but on the basis of Don Foods made incremental, is an extra income.
“一单外卖可能我只赚两块钱，但我还是愿意去挣，因为如果我把外卖砍了，那我的门店可能就直接亏损了。
"I might make two dollars a takeaway, but I'd still like to earn it because if I cut it off, my store could lose money.
”“除非哪一天费用涨到承担不起了，我就不做了。
"" Unless the cost rises too high for me one day, I won't do it.
”上述快餐老板说。
"said the fast-food owner.
在丁晟看来，做外卖已经从一开始的试图增加利润，变成了作为品牌宣传的渠道，为线下堂食引流。
In Sheng Ding's view, doing take-out has evolved from an initial attempt to increase profits into a channel for brand promotion and diversion for offline parlours.
犹豫再三，他还是决定将重点放在堂食。
After much hesitation, he decided to focus on the parlour.
但这并非意味着外卖没有机会了。
But that doesn't mean there are no take-out opportunities.
丁晟身边有只做外卖的商户，即便在20%的费率下，依然活得很好。
Sheng Ding is surrounded by take-out merchants who live well even at a rate of 20 per cent.
因为每天可以做到好几百单，订单密度足够高。
Because you can do hundreds of orders a day, the order density is high enough.
无论如何，疫情就像是一剂催化剂，促使餐饮商家更加重视线上运营、产品质量、服务品质。
In any case, the outbreak acts as a catalyst, prompting the restaurant business to pay more attention to online operations, product quality, service quality.
而这些，都将在未来成为新一轮外卖大战的基础。
These, in the future, will become the basis of a new round of take-out war.
