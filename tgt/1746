澎湃新闻记者 王选辉 实习生 刘宇丹2月19日晚，北京朝阳医院副院长童朝晖、北京地坛医院感染二科主任医师蒋荣猛、中南大学湘雅医院感控科主任吴安华等三位中央指导组医疗救治组专家，就新冠肺炎重症救治召开新闻发布会，介绍了新冠肺炎的重症、危重症患者的特点及救治情况。
Peng Pai journalist Wang electoral Hui intern Liu Yu Dan February 19 night, Beijing Chaoyang Hospital Vice-President Tong Chaohui, Beijing Ditan Hospital Infection Director Dr. Jiang Rong Meng, Central South University Xiangya Hospital Sensitive Control Division Director Wu Anhua, and held a press conference on the severe treatment of Newcrown Pneumonia.
1月18日童朝晖到达武汉，至今已过去一个多月。
January 18 Tong Chaohui arrived in Wuhan, has been more than a month.
在发布会上，他介绍，通过这一段时间的临床总结观察发现，新冠肺炎重症、危重症患者，年龄段主要集中在50岁、60岁以上，而且往往有比较多的基础疾病，比如高血压、糖尿病、冠心病，还有一些有肾脏和脑血管疾病。
In the press conference, he said that through this period of clinical summary observation, the new crown pneumonia, critically ill patients, mainly in the age group of 50, 60 years and more often have more basic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, and some kidney and cerebrovascular diseases.
与SARS相比有什么不同？“大家可能知道2003年SARS得病的都是青壮年，实际上这一回都是年龄偏大的，有基础病的。
"What's the difference with SARS?" As you probably know, SARS in 2003 affected young adults, in fact this time they were older and more basic.
”童朝晖表示，和SARS相比，患者的年龄和基础性不一样。
Mr Tong said the age and basic nature of patients were different from those of SARS.
童朝晖介绍，这些病人多属于缺氧严重，病情进展快。
Tong Chaohui introduced, these patients belong to hypoxia is serious, the disease progresses quickly.
“我也经历过SARS，它主要是受累器官是在肺。
"I have also experienced SARS, which is mainly affected by organs in the lungs.
我们如果在SARS期间能够通过一些措施，不管是无创有创的措施，把肺逆转过来，这个病基本就好了。
If we can reverse the lung through some measures, no matter how uncreative, during SARS, the disease will be basically all right.
”童朝晖说，现在他们发现，新型冠状病毒不仅仅攻击患者的肺，还有心脏，肾脏也会受累。
"Now they have found that the new coronavirus is not just attacking the lungs, but also the heart and kidneys," Tong said.
专家组发现，重症和危重症患者的肌钙蛋白都比较高。
The Panel found that both severe and critically ill patients had higher levels of troponin.
童朝晖介绍，这些患者如果最终发展成为呼吸衰竭，心脏、肾脏等器官都会出问题，导致多器官功能衰竭。
If these patients eventually develop respiratory failure, heart, kidney and other organs will be a problem, leading to multi-organ failure, said Tong.
蒋荣猛介绍，2003年的SARS有个特点，基本上（患者）都发热38℃以上。
Jiang Rong Meng introduces, 2003 SARS has a characteristic, basically (patient) is calorific above 38 ℃.
所以2003年后，国内设立发热门诊，可以把这个病给筛出来，所以在比较早期就可以把它筛除了。
So after 2003, the establishment of a fever clinic in the country, the disease can be sifted out, so it can be sifted off relatively early.
“但是这个病（新冠肺炎）不太一样，还有很多（患者）发热程度不高，三十七八度，还有的不发烧，所以它有一定的隐蔽性。
"But it's not the same thing [New Crown Pneumonia], and there are a lot of [patients] who don't have a high fever, thirty-eight degrees, and some don't have a fever, so it has a certain amount of concealment.
”蒋荣猛说。
"said Chiang Rong fiercely.
“感染以后，这个病的进展相对比较慢。
"Since the infection, the disease has been progressing relatively slowly.
”蒋荣猛说，和我们熟悉的病相比，流感或者禽流感一般发病以后的三四天就可以到重症肺炎。
Jiang said harshly that three to four days after a flu or bird flu outbreak can lead to severe pneumonia, compared with familiar diseases.
而新冠肺炎，有的患者一开始五六天的时候，情况不太严重，患者可能不来看病。
But the new crown pneumonia, some patients at the beginning of five or six days, the situation is not so serious, patients may not come to see a doctor.
但是患者仍旧是有传染性的，会通过家庭、社区，或者朋友聚餐传播。
But patients are still contagious and spread through family, community, or friend meals.
“还有一个特点是早期不典型。
"Another feature is the early atypia.
”蒋荣猛说，这个病老年人感染得多，而且病症比较重，现在发现很多患者是因为别的疾病，（早期）到普通科室去看病。
Jiang said the elderly with the disease were infected more often and had more serious illnesses, and now find that many of them go to general departments for treatment because of other diseases.
“比如说去呼吸科，或者去神经外科，或者去其他的科室。
"For example, to the respiratory department, or to neurosurgery, or to other departments.
他看病的时候他可能有肺炎，但是肺炎不严重，这个病不是主要的，他可能是去看神经外科的一些疾病，当然它是有传染性的。
He may have pneumonia when he is seeing a doctor, but pneumonia is not serious. This disease is not the main one. He may be going to see some neurosurgical disease, but it is contagious.
”危重症救治工作开始步入正轨童朝晖介绍，通过这段时间，在国家卫健委的领导下，目前危重症救治工作慢慢已经开始步入正轨。
"Critical care began to enter the right child Chaohui introduction, through this period, under the leadership of the National Health Committee, the critical care work has slowly begun to enter the right track.
首先，武汉金银潭医院、武汉大学中南医院、武汉肺科医院被作为三家重点专门收治重症和危重症患者的医院。
First, Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital, Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital and Wuhan Lung Hospital are regarded as three key hospitals specially for the treatment of severe and critically ill patients.
随着床位不够，又继续扩张。
As the number of beds was insufficient, it continued to expand.
武汉协和医院西院、同济中法（华中科技大学同济医学院附属同济医院中法新城院区）、湖北省人民医院东院也被列入。
The west hospital of Wuhan Concorde Hospital, Tongji Zhongfa (Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology) and Hubei Provincial People's Hospital East Hospital are also included.
目前总共是6家比较大的医院作为收治重症和危重症的医院，随着全国各地的医疗队的到来，一些重点、重要的医疗队已经被放在这6家医院。
A total of six of the larger hospitals are now in critical and critical condition, and with the arrival of medical teams throughout the country, a number of key and important medical teams have been placed in these six hospitals.
第二，从策略上，通过前期的摸索，总结出要把抢救、救治的关口前移，积极的去救治危重症患者。
Second, from the strategy, through the preliminary groping, summed up to rescue, cure the pass forward, actively to treat critically ill patients.
并且有国家级的专家和省级专家去各个医院巡视、巡诊，指导工作。
And has the national level expert and the provincial expert to each hospital patrol, inspects, guides the work.
这些病人都是多器官功能衰竭，同时也有多学科的专家进行会诊。
These patients are suffering from multiple organ failure and are also consulted by a multidisciplinary team of specialists.
另外，还要及时对死亡病例进行分析，进行死亡病例讨论，从中总结一些经验。
In addition, timely analysis of death cases, discussion of death cases, from which some lessons can be drawn.
第三，密切关注和监测轻型和普通型患者的病情变化。
Third, pay close attention and monitor the changes of light and ordinary patients.
有一部分轻型和普通型患者病情会突然加重，变为重症。
Some light and ordinary patients will suddenly increase the severity of the disease, become serious.
这个期间，就需要医生要密切地监测患者的指标。
During this period, doctors are required to closely monitor the patient's indicators.
这种密切观察能够防止向重症发展。
Such close observation can prevent progression to serious illness.
童朝晖介绍，医护人员还采取了一些干预措施，比方说尽量让患者得到一个好的环境休息，再就是抗病毒治疗，还有中西结合的治疗，让这些轻型普通型患者能够尽量少发展成重症。
Some of the interventions, such as trying to give patients a good rest in the environment, combined with anti-viral treatment and a combination of Chinese and Western treatments, have helped to minimize the risk of serious illness, said Tong.
“有时候不可避免有一些患者会发展成重症危重症，转运和转诊机制也建立了，也有流程。
"Sometimes it is inevitable that some patients will develop into severe and critical cases, and transit and referral mechanisms are in place and procedures are in place.
”童朝晖说，按照这些措施，这段时间各个医院，特别是几家重点救治重症患者的医院运行平稳有序，目前每天都有一些重症和危重症患者从这几家医院出院。
According to the measures, hospitals, especially those that focus on treating the seriously ill, are running smoothly and orderly, and a number of critically ill and critically ill patients are being discharged from these hospitals every day, according to Tong.
