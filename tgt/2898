Play武汉嫂子“汉骂”视频“汉骂”嫂子和作家方方数日前，一段微信语音在网上“一骂而红”，名叫“@雨儿”的业主在她所在的小区群里，用中气十足的武汉方言痛斥社区和中百超市推出“阴阳套餐”，社区推卸责任、置若罔闻。
A few days ago, my sister-in-law and author Fang Fang-fang called "Yuer @ Yuer," a microphone voice scolding her sister-in-law and writer Fang Fang, said on the Internet a few days ago.
“我们买一袋米，就要买什么草纸、酱油，买一堆”“你们在我们这里做了么事，列个表出来看，差火（缺德）！”“……沆瀣一气，一丘之貉，说这都是褒奖你们了。
What straw and soy sauce do we buy for a sack of rice, and buy a heap of "What have you done here, come out and look at it, and do not do good!" --did not scruple to collude, and say it was a compliment to you.
”不到半日，这段录屏视频在微博播放量超300万。
In less than half a day, the video was broadcast more than three million times on Weibo.
在全民隔离的低迷状态下，“武汉嫂子”用气吞山河的一段汉骂，成为部分武汉市民情绪的泄压阀。
In the general isolation of the low state, "sister-in-law in Wuhan" with a section of gas Yongshan River, become part of the Wuhan city of the emotional vent valve.
1月23日起，武汉全面交通管制，进入史无前例的全城封闭式管理，家家户户闭门防疫，能不出门就不出门，复工时间无限推迟，生活物资的迫切需求却始终难以跟上。
From January 23, Wuhan comprehensive traffic control, entered the unprecedented city-wide closed management, families closed epidemic prevention, can not go out without going out, the resumption of work indefinitely postponed, the urgent need for supplies has been difficult to keep pace with.
武汉某社区居民在城市留言板中反映：社区封闭管理，出行困难，社区超市也被迫关闭，居民得不到基本生活保障小区封闭，生活圈被隔断，作为社会基础设施之一的商超服务功能大打折扣。
In a message board in the city, residents of a community in Wuhan reported that community closures, travel difficulties, the closure of community supermarkets, the closure of basic living quarters, the isolation of living quarters and the reduction in the functioning of commercial services as one of the social infrastructure.
围城之中，需求大，状态紧，团购买菜经历一波三折，前期陆续滋长了不少不满和质疑。
In the siege, the demand is large, the state is tight, the Mission to buy vegetables experienced ups and downs, the early stages of a number of dissatisfaction and doubts.
比如以“武汉嫂子”为代表的部分市民，就认为团购的蔬菜存在品种单一、价格偏高以及捆绑销售等问题。
For example, "sister-in-law in Wuhan" as the representative of some citizens, on the group purchase of vegetables there are single varieties, high prices and bundled sales and other issues.
武商超市推出的“社区套餐”“走红的几句“汉骂”则直截了当地痛斥其中两点：1、社区前期不作为，业主们被迫自救，社区接手后反而端架子。
The "community package" launched by the martial arts supermarket "popular" few "Han scold" directly denounced two of them: 1, the community did not act in the early days, owners were forced to save themselves, the community took over after the end of the shelf instead.
2、中百超市售卖AB套餐，不合理捆绑销售，价格贵。
2, 100 supermarkets sell AB package, unreasonable bundled sales, the price is expensive.
武汉作家方方在日记中写道：这里面粗口很少，很讲道理，应该算是武汉的雅骂。
Wuhan writer Fang Fang wrote in his diary: There are very few swear, very reasonable, should be regarded as Wuhan elegant scolding.
作此评价的方方，在隔离之后也写起了“武汉日记”和“封城记”。
This evaluation of the Fang Fang, after the isolation also wrote "Wuhan Diary" and "The Book of Seals".
她的日记中也提到武汉人民的生活物资问题：“武汉已经封城了一个月，春节期间的储存基本上消耗完了，吃喝是人们很大的问题。
"Wuhan has been closed for a month, and the stock during the Spring Festival has basically run out, so people have a big problem eating and drinking.
”买菜是日常的小事，到了疫期，就是民生大事。
"Buying vegetables is a daily trifle, and when it comes to epidemics, it is a matter of livelihood.
作家们、名人们开始公开地谈论“买菜”，对于买菜过程中出现的不满宣泄，也让一个普通的武汉嫂子成为名人。
Writers and celebrities began to talk openly about "buying vegetables," about the dissatisfaction in the process of buying vegetables, let an ordinary sister-in-law become a celebrity.
早在2月初，中篇小说《霍乱之乱》的武汉籍作者池莉在疫情爆发后向自己小区发出一封建议书，建议物业公司集中直购蔬菜送到小区，让业主将隔离进行到底。
Back in early February, Wuhan-based writer Chi Li, the author of the Chinese novel Cholera in Disarray, issued a proposal to her small community after the outbreak, advising property companies to concentrate on buying vegetables directly to the community so that owners could follow through with the isolation.
2月7日，池莉在《新民周刊》上用口述形式再次呼吁：“为什么不能‘配给制’送菜到社区？公交车和单位公车都闲置着，为什么不动用全社会力量进行彻底隔离？”买菜的问题，不断地被提出、被解决，又有新的问题出现。
On February 7, Chi Li told Xinmin Weekly in oral form: "Why can't the rationing system 'deliver food to the community? Bus and unit buses are idle. Why not use the whole society to completely isolate them?" The problem of buying vegetables is constantly being raised, solved and new problems arise.
2月18日，武汉的商超不接待散客零售，解决了大家在超市拥挤、交叉感染的问题。
February 18, Wuhan Shang Chao do not accept retail retail, solve the problem of overcrowding, cross-infection in supermarkets.
但2月22日，“武汉嫂子”一骂，又发现配送里的“阴阳套餐”的弊端。
But February 22, "Wuhan sister-in-law" a scold, and found that the distribution of "Yin-yang set meal" shortcomings.
“武汉嫂子”火了之后，某小区又炸出一个武汉“爹爹”，一位70多岁的老人买草纸，却因为捆绑销售，不得已和卫生巾搭配在一起买。
"Sister-in-law in Wuhan" after the fire, a district of Wuhan "Daddy," a 70-year-old bought grass paper, because bundled sales, and had to with sanitary towels.
“爹爹”打电话给市长热线投诉，社区人员却也哭笑不得，只能再次反复强调超市方面限于人力，城区配送区域太多等。
"Daddy" called the mayor's hotline to complain, but the community also laughed, can only repeat that supermarket is limited to manpower, urban distribution areas too much.
2月23日，中百超市就“汉嫂”指摘的阴阳套餐进行回应，声称已从即日起，取消套餐团购模式。
February 23, 100 supermarkets on the "Chinese sister-in-law" accused Yin-yang package meal response, claiming that from now on, the cancellation of package purchase mode.
至今，武汉买菜的最后一公里，还是不断有新的问题出现。
So far, Wuhan shopping for the last kilometer, or continue to have new problems.
目前武汉所面临的困局，直接指向了基层社区服务工作的胶着状态。
At present Wuhan is facing a difficult situation, directly pointing to the grass-roots community service work of the status quo.
物流配送、社区管理、物价捆绑……名人也好，普通人也罢，总要有人发声。
Logistics distribution, community management, price bundling... celebrities and ordinary people alike, always need someone to make their voices heard.
然而骂两句，写两句，都很难一下子说清楚，疫情旋涡中心的武汉人每天焦头烂额的，具体是什么。
However scold two words, write two sentences, it is difficult to say at once, the vortex center of the epidemic Wuhan people daily struggling, is what.
柴米油盐，蔬食饮水，这些不是“不成问题的问题”，而是必须解决的难题。
Diesel, water and vegetables, these are not "no problem", but have to solve the problem.
“最后一公里”武汉市民的手机里，经常收到买菜的新办法通知，一变再变之后，还总是遇见困难。
"The last kilometer" Wuhan city people's mobile phones, often received a new way to buy vegetables notice, change again and again, but also always encountered difficulties.
张益所在的江岸区某小区，附近1公里处有一家中百仓储，2公里内有“家乐福”。
Zhang Yi is located in a small district of the river, a nearby 1 km in a warehouse, 2 km has a "Carrefour."
武汉禁止个人出门购物，实行社区团购，和网络下单之后，他先在手机程序商城找到“中百仓储APP”，下载下来却发现“程序正在开发中”，几天内连续下了三次，结果都一样。
Wuhan prohibited individuals from going shopping, carrying out community shopping, and ordering online, he first found the "Zhong100 Warehouse APP" in the mobile phone program mall and found it was "under development" three times in a matter of days, with the same result.
他转而搜索2公里外的家乐福超市的购物APP，下载下来后却发现自己的地址“不在配送范围内”。
Instead, he searched Carrefour's shopping APP two kilometers away and found his address "out of range."
而居住在江汉区的陈楠，刚开始团购的时候，哪怕她与父母全家人出动“抢单”，也败于手速跟不上网速，稍一走神，手指一慢，就没米下锅了。
Chen Nan, who lives in Jianghan District, started the group purchase, even if she and her parents and family out to "snatch tickets," also lost the speed of the network, a little distracted, a slow fingers, no rice pot.
一天三餐，家家户户都要吃饭。
Every family needs to eat three meals a day.
都要吃饭，下单人数、次数过多，很多超市APP平台也遭遇频繁崩溃。
Want to eat, order the number, too many times, many supermarket APP platform also encountered frequent crashes.
微博上部分武汉市民对于“团购”的抱怨在武汉这种大型中部城市，一个中级小区至少也有上万名住户，社区工作人员不超过50名，光是确保隔离、维持社区环境，就已经占据了社区的大半主要工作，更别提挨家挨户送菜上门。
In a large central city like Wuhan, where there are at least tens of thousands of households and no more than 50 community workers, ensuring isolation and maintaining a community environment already accounts for most of the community's work, not to mention door-to-door deliveries.
新冠肺炎，把武汉人民的生活彻底打散、打碎了。
The new crown pneumonia, the Wuhan people's lives completely shattered, broken.
原有的线上购物方式和运送体系应对乏力，疫区人民日常生活中最基础的买菜购物都需得遵循另一套逻辑。
The original online shopping methods and delivery system to deal with fatigue, the people in affected areas in daily life the most basic shopping needs to follow a different logic.
微博网友上传的武汉某封闭小区内居民取菜图志愿者，是特殊时期的另一个主要求助对象。
Weibo users upload a closed district of Wuhan residents to take food map volunteers, is another special period of the main help object.
张益所在小区的邻居们成立了志愿者团队，在业主群里以“购物接龙”的各式搜集各人的买菜需求，再由志愿者统一采购送上门。
Neighbors in Zhang Yi's neighborhood set up a volunteer team to collect customers' needs in a variety of "shopping for dragons," which were then delivered to their homes by volunteers.
但他们一开始就被反复强调：可购蔬菜有限，一些商家只卖菜，一些商家只卖肉。
But they have been repeatedly stressed at the outset: vegetables are limited, some shops only sell vegetables, some only sell meat.
并且，为了节省效率，志愿者团队只负责代购油盐柴米蔬菜等必备食物，不包括面包、牛奶等副食。
And, to save efficiency, the volunteer team is only responsible for buying essential foods such as oily salt and firewood and vegetables, not bread, milk, etc.
张益想买点肉，但附近最大的中百超市称只向30份以上的肉类出具订单，这意味着他必须在同一个群内找到至少30个想同时买猪肉的业主。
Mr. Zhang wants to buy some meat, but the largest supermarket in the neighborhood says it only places orders for more than 30 pieces of meat, meaning he must find at least 30 owners in the same group who want to buy pork at the same time.
他住在一个只有两栋主楼的旧小区，且多以一室一厅的单人户型为主，一次性达到30户以上购肉需求并非易事。
He lives in an old neighborhood with only two main buildings, mostly single-person homes with one living room and one living room. It is not easy to buy meat from more than 30 households at a time.
群里每天都有业主埋怨买不到想买的菜，面对七嘴八舌，志愿者只得在群里“手动”分散需求：3号群有买肉的人，4号群可以买水果。
The owners complained every day that they could not buy the food they wanted. Faced with this, the volunteers had to spread the demand "manually" among the group: the third group had meat buyers and the fourth group could buy fruit.
不能出门的业主极大依赖跑腿的志愿者，在一片混乱中怨声四起，有的埋怨运送慢，有的埋怨到手的蔬菜蔫烂不新鲜，有的质疑老板送的肉菜缺斤少两，还不能复秤。
Owners who cannot leave their homes rely heavily on errand-running volunteers, grumbling in the chaos, complaining of slow delivery, slouching vegetables, questioning whether the meat given by the boss is too small to be weighed.
前些时候，武汉本地长江日报公布了政府规定的肉价，武大商超平均限定在20-40元/斤。
Some time ago, the local Changjiang Daily of Wuhan announced the price of meat fixed by the Government and the average of Wu Daoshang was limited to 20-40 yuan per catty.
然而，无论在社区团内报价，还是“武汉本地宝”小程序公布的超市方物价，张益都找不到低于50元/斤的肉，更找不到传说中的“十元蔬菜包”。
However, no matter the price quoted within the community group or the prices announced by the local Wuhan Bao program, Zhang Yicheng couldn't find any meat less than 50 yuan per catty, nor the legendary ten-yuan vegetable bag.
他在采购团内发布的价格表上看到，中百超市五花肉55元/斤，但最后送到单元楼后货到付款却被要价126元/斤。
He saw on the price list published in the purchasing group that the Chinese supermarket cost 55 yuan per catty, but was charged 126 yuan per catty for the final delivery of the goods to the unit building.
他打电话给超市追问，忙得手忙脚乱的商家简促地跟他说：我们就是个菜贩子，你跟我们计较什么？2月25日，方超所在的江汉区某小区，解散了志愿者团队。
He called the supermarket to ask, busy businessmen told him in a hurry: We are a vegetable dealer, you care about us? Feb. 25, Fang Chao's district of Jianghan District, dissolved the volunteer team.
志愿者属于业主自发团队，没有社区授权，超市方不予提供APP下单对接。
Volunteers belong to the owner of the spontaneous team, there is no community authorization, supermarket do not provide APP single docking.
业主向社区提出授权志愿团队的要求，只得到冰冷的回应：“出了事我们负不起责任。
Owners who ask the community to authorize volunteer teams get a cold response: "We can't take responsibility when things go wrong.
”方超社区的志愿者团队，在买菜之外的其他活动也不顺利。
The team of Fang Chao-community volunteers did not fare well in other activities besides shopping.
他们在志愿者群内发起了一场募捐，为小区保安、清扫人员捐助防护服、口罩、酒精等物资，也遭到了物业拒绝。
They launched a fund-raising campaign among the volunteers to donate protective clothing, masks, alcohol and other supplies for community security and cleaners, which were also rejected by the property.
业委会极力反对，因为“这次捐赠没有经过官方渠道，没有征得他们同意。
The industry council strongly objected because "the donation was not made through official channels and without their consent."
”沟通、疏解的渠道似乎面临铜墙铁壁，生活被隔离僵硬地堵死了。
Channels of communication and conciliation seem to face a wall of iron, and life is rigidly blocked by isolation.
25日，自愿者团队只得无奈地原地解散。
On the 25th, the volunteer team had to be dissolved in situ.
随着隔离戒严加剧，居民家中囤货消殆，人们对物资的需求只会有增无减。
As the isolation curfew intensifies and residents hoard goods in their homes, the demand for supplies will only increase.
围城之中，社区、业主、志愿者，像一辆马车的三个角，朝同一个方向用力，新鲜食材才可能送到家家户户。
In the midst of the siege, communities, owners, volunteers, like the three corners of a horse and cart, pressed in the same direction before fresh food could reach every household.
但这毕竟是第一次全城规模的大型团购运动，在人力物力都极其有限的条件下，初期难免在配合各方需求上南辕北辙。
But this is the first large-scale city-wide group purchase campaign, under the conditions of extremely limited human and material resources, the initial needs of the parties inevitably diverging.
但问题在发生，也在解决。
But problems are occurring, and they are being solved.
有业主开始理解。
Owners are beginning to understand.
社区也好，志愿者也罢，以少对多，站在最大利益的角度考量，除了紧盯“制度”，还可以把目光放到个体的“人”身上，或许才能看到硬币的另一面。
From the point of view of less to more, and in the best interests of both the community and the volunteers, it is possible to look at the other side of the coin by focusing not only on the "system," but also on the individual "person."
远亲不如近邻文琪所在的武昌区某小区业委会协助业主建立了志愿者团队，小区约15栋单元楼，每个单元约4-5名志愿者，每个志愿者平均三天一次轮流出楼团购。
The neighborhood Wenqi Wuchang District, a neighborhood industry committee to help owners set up a team of volunteers, about 15 unit blocks, each unit about 4-5 volunteers, each an average of three days out of the group.
除了小区外的中百仓储，业委会还帮忙联系上了五百米外的连锁超市麦德龙。
In addition to the community outside of the 100 warehouse, the industry committee also helped to contact the 500 meters away supermarket chain Medellon.
麦德龙也给出团购套餐，包括“米油调味料”和“生活用品”两类，每个社区总套餐100份起送，接单时间为每天上午10点至下午1点。
Metro also offered group meals, including "rice noodle condiments" and "daily necessities," with a total of 100 meals per community from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.
在当天晚8点之前，业主在各楼群里报备购物需求，再由志愿者统计整理成文档集中发给超市，以提前备货。
Before 8: 00 pm on the same day, owners in the various buildings to report shopping needs, and then organized by volunteers statistics organized into documents distributed to supermarkets, in advance of the delivery.
志愿者整理的业主需求文档起初，群里互传文档接龙填写，后来有志愿者开发了一个简便的接龙小程序，数分钟就能完成意愿征集。
At first, documents were passed from one group to another, and then volunteers developed a simple catcher program that took a few minutes to complete.
文琪宁愿囤积多些需求再下单，中百超市可以为个人买零散的货物，但“套餐更快”，无疑可以分担志愿者的工作量，同时也提高配送效率。
Vinci would rather hoard more demand and place orders, and a hundred supermarkets can buy individual pieces of merchandise, but "package meals faster" will no doubt share the volunteer workload while improving delivery efficiency.
当业主、志愿者和社区委员会多方面开始为对方考虑的时候，事情的效率必然会得到提高，隔离时期的物资配备，离“有条不紊”不远了。
When owners, volunteers, and community committees start thinking about each other in many ways, the efficiency of things is bound to improve, and the equipment provided during the isolation period is not far from "orderly."
文琪所在小区的志愿者正在单元楼底下卸货送货对文琪而言，这是一次从混乱到有序的隔离体验。
The volunteers in Vinci's neighborhood were unloading goods under the apartment building. For Vinci, it was a messy, orderly isolation experience.
每天活跃在群里的“楼友”们成了他们最近的交流者，一栋楼百余人逐渐熟络起来，以前从未说过话的邻里对门，组团买个酱油就重新认识了一次。
Every day active in the group of "building friends" become their nearest communicator, a building more than 100 people gradually become familiar, never said before the neighbourhood door, groups to buy a soy sauce on a new acquaintance.
一位同栋楼的女士在超市售罄后向文琪要一点84消毒液，文琪把家里多余的消毒液用袋子装好放在自家门口，对方拿走后给文琪发了红包：非常时期东西贵，请收下！文琪没收，反倒转而问她：我只有三罐咖啡豆了，你家有没有多的可以分我点？两人在微信上私聊起来，文琪才得知对方是前些年经常在公园里遇到的一位母亲，那时候她们的孩子都还小，见过好几十次面，却从没正式打个招呼。
One of the women in the building asked Vinci for 1. 84 disinfectant after the store had sold out. Vinci packed the extra disinfectant in a bag and left it in front of her house.
两人还约了疫情结束后串门小酌，文琪住在武汉整整十多年，头一回感受到了旧年代电视剧里呈现的那种邻里和洽与自然。
The two men also about the end of the epidemic after visiting the door, Wenqi lived in Wuhan for more than a decade, the first experience of the old television drama presented the kind of harmony and nature.
从某种程度上来说，这次隔离把平时居住在同一屋檐下的单独个体串联起来了，相互之间仍有厚重的墙，但它似乎仅仅是为了隔离病毒。
To some extent, the isolation linked individuals living under the same roof, still with thick walls, but only to isolate the virus.
2月23日，针对部分居民对街道社区保障服务工作不到位的反映，武汉市江岸区对社区前期工作中的不足向居民诚恳致歉，并向全体业主发布公告，表示将加强与业委会、物业、居民的沟通联动。
On 23 February, in response to complaints from some residents about the lack of community support services, the Jiangan district of Wuhan sincerely apologized to the residents for the deficiencies in the pre-work of the community and issued a notice to all owners stating that they would strengthen communication with the industry committee, property and residents.
钟南山院士说，武汉是一座英雄之城。
Academician Zhong Nan Shan said that Wuhan is a city of heroes.
这座城市正在经历最痛苦的时期，疫情暂时掩盖了它往日的鲜活生猛。
The city is going through one of its most painful periods, with the epidemic temporarily overshadowing its former vibrancy.
“汉嫂”一个也许足矣，但既撬起了实实在在的问题，就不得不去直面它。
"Sister-in-law" one may be enough, but both pry up the real problem, had to face it.
眼下最重要的事，既是“活下去”，也是“生活下去”，正如武汉街头随处可见城市标语“每天都不一样”。
The most important thing at the moment is to "live" and "live," just as city slogans such as "Make a Difference Everyday" can be found everywhere in Wuhan.
个人或许不能控制疫情，但终究希望还能控制自己的生活。
Individuals may not be able to control the epidemic, but in the end they may wish to take control of their lives.
这才是武汉直率爽朗的硬气，是面对痛苦和停滞的勇气。
This is Wuhan forthright and forthright hardness, is the face of pain and stagnation courage.
