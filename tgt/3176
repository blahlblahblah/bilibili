文 |《巴伦周刊》中国撰稿人 郭力群编辑 | 康娟新冠肺炎疫情爆发后，中国部分经济活动一度陷入停滞，这一点从近期公布的经济数据中就能看出。
As recent economic data show, some of China's economic activity stalled at one time after Bareng's China writer Guo Liqun, editor and author of BARREN's New Crown Pneumonia.
中国海关总署3月7日发布的数据显示，今年前两个月，中国进出口总值5919.9亿美元，下降11%。
According to figures released March 7 by China's General Administration of Customs, China's import and export value fell 11 percent to 591.99 billion US dollars in the first two months of this year.
其中出口2924.5亿美元，下降17.2%；进口2995.4亿美元，下降4%；贸易逆差70.9亿美元，去年同期为顺差414.5亿美元。
Of that amount, exports fell by 17.2 per cent to $292.45 billion, imports by 4 per cent, and the trade deficit was $7.09 billion, compared with a surplus of $41.45 billion in the same period last year.
进入3月后，中国的疫情形势继续逐步好转，对经济活动的影响有所减轻，全国复产复工范围继续扩大。
Since March, the situation in China has continued to gradually improve, the impact on economic activities has been reduced, and the scope for the resumption of work nationwide has continued to expand.
不过在中国疫情形势好转的同时，中国以外地区的感染人数却继续呈上升趋势。
But while the situation in China has improved, the number of infections outside China continues to rise.
这一形势增加了中国面临的疫情输入性风险，导致人员流动依然在一定程度上受到限制，一些医药行业厂商因用工短缺而无法全面复工。
This situation has increased the import risk of the epidemic faced by China, resulting in continued restrictions on the movement of people and the inability of some pharmaceutical companies to resume full employment owing to a shortage of workers.
而这也令对中国原料药和医护用品存在很大依赖的美国出现了药物“告急”。
This has also led to a drug "emergency" in the United States, which relies heavily on Chinese APIs and medical supplies.
中国原料药“断供”影响显现《巴伦周刊》在“疫情如何影响医疗保健行业四大关键领域”一文中指出，疫情对医药供应链的影响已经成为一个非常令人担忧的问题，这是因为一些跨国制药公司严重依赖中国工厂生产的原料药，在疫情还在干扰中国经济之际，这可能会导致供应问题。
The impact of the outbreak on the pharmaceutical supply chain has become a major concern as multinational pharmaceutical companies rely heavily on Chinese-made APIs, which could lead to supply problems at a time when the epidemic is still disrupting the Chinese economy.
原料药，即活性药物成分(API），其采购状况是保密的，所以很难知道哪些药物需要来自中国的成分，但可以肯定的是，这是一个重要因素。
The status of procurement of APIs, or active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), is confidential, making it difficult to know which drugs require ingredients from China, but it is certainly an important factor.
拥有数家原料药工厂的赛诺菲(Sanofi, SNY)的首席执行官告诉《巴伦周刊》，全球60%的原料药是中国生产的。
The chief executive of Sanofi, SNY, which owns several APIs, told Barendra that 60 per cent of the world's APIs are made in China.
2月27日晚间，美国食品药品监督管理局(FDA)报告了美国第一起因疫情引起的药品短缺事件，但没有透露是哪种药物受到了影响。
On the night of Feb. 27, the Food and Drug Administration reported the first case of a drug shortage in the United States caused by the outbreak, but did not say which drugs were affected.
药品短缺现象出现得比专家预测的要早得多，但根据FDA提供的有限信息还无法判断其严重程度。
The drug shortage occurred much earlier than experts had predicted, but the FDA's limited information does not allow it to gauge its severity.
制药公司通常手头有大量的储备原料药，但这些储备也有用完的那一天。
Pharmaceutical companies usually have large stocks of APIs on hand, but those stocks run out on the same day.
Bernstein分析师罗尼·盖尔(Ronny Gal)2月28日称，目前有关药品短缺的案例只有一个，还没有引起重视。
Ronny Gal, an analyst at Bernstein, said on Feb. 28 that there was only one case of a shortage of drugs that had not been highlighted.
但他援引业内高管的讲话称，美国仿制药的“现货短缺”现象可能会在今年第二季度或第三季度初出现。
But he quoted industry executives as saying that a "spot shortage" of generic drugs in the US could occur in the second or early third quarter of this year.
制药公司此前称它们还没有出现药品短缺的情况。
Pharmaceutical companies have said they have not experienced a shortage of drugs.
默克(Merck, MRK)在一份声明中说，“目前形势一直在变化中，但是在这一点上，我们预计公司的供应链不会受影响，除非疫情造成的供应中断在未来几个月一直持续。
"The situation is constantly changing, but at this point we do not expect the supply chain of the company to be affected unless the supply disruption caused by the epidemic continues in the coming months," Merck (MRK) said in a statement.
”迈兰公司 (Mylan，MYL)首席执行官希瑟·布雷施(Heather Bresch)在2月27日晚间的财报电话会议上表示，疫情可能会影响公司的供应链。
Heather Bresch, Mylan's chief executive, said in a conference call on the night of February 27 that the outbreak could affect the company's supply chain.
“考虑到我们的供应链、运营和业务都是全球化的，因此公司业绩可能会受到影响，”她说。
"Considering that our supply chains, operations and operations are global, corporate performance may be affected," she said.
美国健康系统药剂师协会(American Society of Health-System Pharmacists)药剂实践和质量主任迈克尔·加尼奥(Michael Ganio)称，“这种情况持续的时间越长，某些药物面临的风险就越大。
Michael Ganio, director of pharmaceutical practice and quality at the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, says: "The longer this goes on, the greater the risk to some drugs.
”现在，药剂师所能做的就是等待。
"All a pharmacist can do now is wait.
“每个人都在为可能发生的事情做准备，但没有人知道现在该如何应对，”加尼奥说。
"Everyone is preparing for what could happen, but no one knows what to do now," Gagnol said.
在FDA报告美国出现药品短缺事件之际，印度3月3日决定限制部分药品和原料药的出口，这进一步表明疫情正在给药品供应链造成破坏。
India's decision on March 3 to restrict the export of some drugs and APIs comes as the FDA reported a drug shortage in the United States, further evidence that the epidemic is undermining the pharmaceutical supply chain.
《巴伦周刊》在“印度当局限制部分药品出口”一文中指出，印度也是原料药的主要生产国，但同时也需要从中国进口原料药生产药品。
In the article "Indian authorities restrict the export of certain medicines," Barenni Weekly noted that India is also a major producer of APIs, but also needs to import APIs from China for the manufacture of medicines.
据路透社(Reuters)报道，印度政府表示，印度制药厂手头的材料只可供两到三个月的药品生产。
India's pharmaceutical plant has only two to three months of drugs on hand, according to Reuters.
这对美国的制药公司和消费者意味着什么还很难说。
What this means for US drug companies and consumers is hard to say.
加尼奥表示，这条供应链不够透明，目前还无法判断印度的决定对美国消费者的影响。
Mr Gagnol said the supply chain was not transparent enough to judge the impact of India's decision on US consumers.
特朗普再提“国产化”3月2日，特朗普政府应对新冠病毒疫情的工作小组在白宫会见了制药公司和生物技术公司的代表。
Trump Refers to "Domestication" On March 2, the Trump administration's Task Force on the New Crown Virus Epidemic met with representatives of pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies at the White House.
特朗普在会上称，疫情的爆发突显了把之前被外包的药品和设备的制造供应链重新带回美国的重要性，为了遏制病毒的传播，“我们迫切需要”这些药品和设备。
Trump told the meeting that the outbreak highlighted the importance of bringing back to the US the supply chain for previously outsourced drugs and equipment that "we urgently need" to contain the spread of the virus.
特朗普表示，美国已经在采取措施降低对通过其他国家获得关键药品和设备的依赖程度。
Trump says the US is already taking steps to reduce its dependence on other countries for essential medicines and equipment.
特朗普还说，“我们希望在美国国内生产某些药品，现在这些药品不仅依赖中国，还依赖爱尔兰等好多国家，而美国现在非常需要这些药。
Trump also said, "We want to make certain drugs domestically in the United States that now depend not only on China, but also on a number of countries, such as Ireland, which the US needs so much."
”FDA今年2月底表示，他们了解到有20种在美国销售的药品是在中国生产的，或者依赖于只在中国生产的原料药。
At the end of February, the FDA said it was aware of 20 drugs sold in the U.S. that were made in China or that relied on APIs manufactured only in China.
此外，根据FDA的数据，截至2018年，中国是对美国药物和生物制剂的第二大出口国，医疗设备的第一大出口国。
Moreover, according to the FDA, as of 2018, China is the second-largest exporter of drugs and biological agents to the United States, and the largest exporter of medical equipment.
美国官员一直在就过度依赖中国原料药生产商这一问题发出警告。
U. S. officials have been warning of over-reliance on Chinese API manufacturers.
联邦政府美中经济与安全审查委员会(U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission)去年11月就曾警告称，依赖中国的药品和原料药“给美国经济和国家安全带来风险”。
The U.S. -China Economic and Security Review Commission warned last November that reliance on Chinese medicines and APIs "poses a risk to the US economy and national security."
生物伦理学研究机构Hastings Center高级顾问罗斯玛丽·吉布森(Rosemary Gibson)表示，依赖来自其他国家的药品会让美国变得脆弱。
Rosemary Gibson, a senior adviser at the Hastings Center, a bioethics research institute, says dependence on drugs from other countries makes the US vulnerable.
“疫情敲响了警钟，供应链中断给美国的这一薄弱之处带来了冲击。
"The epidemic is a wake-up call, and supply chain disruptions have had an impact on this weakness in the US."
”美国人也面临“一罩难求”美国的感染人数近期上升后，除了药品，美国也开始面临口罩短缺的情况。
"The United States is also facing a shortage of face masks, in addition to medicines, after a recent rise in the number of Americans infected.
据报道，销售口罩等产品的美国医用器械生产商Dealmed Medical Supplies总裁迈克尔·艾因霍恩(Michael Einhorn)称，新冠肺炎疫情爆发后，该公司没有再收到新的补给， 通常生产口罩的中国工厂已经两个月没有发货了。
Michael Einhorn, president of Dealmed Medical Supplies, which sells products such as masks, says the company hasn't received new supplies since the outbreak of the new crown pneumonia, and that the Chinese factory that makes the masks hasn't shipped in two months.
业内专家表示，中国是全球最大的医用口罩供应商。
Industry experts say China is the world's largest supplier of medical masks.
尽管中国商务部表示不会限制医用口罩的出口，但Dealmed并不是唯一一家面临供应短缺的公司。
Dealmed is not the only company facing a shortage of supplies, although China's commerce ministry says it will not restrict the export of medical masks.
加拿大医疗器械制造商Medicom在中国有三家工厂，但该公司首席运营官纪尧姆·拉弗杜尔(Guillaume Laverdure)称，中国政府已经征用了所有产品，所以这几家工厂没有任何产品出口。
Canadian medical-device maker Medicom has three plants in China, but its chief operating officer, Guillaume Laverdure, says the government has expropriated all its products, so none of them are exported.
“我们估计全球大约80%的口罩都是在中国生产的，”拉弗杜尔说。
"We estimate that about 80 per cent of all respirators worldwide are made in China," says Raffdur.
“一夜之间，全球口罩供应量减少了80%，现在市场对中国以外的现有产能有着非常大的需求。
"The global supply of masks has been reduced by 80 per cent overnight and there is now a huge demand for existing capacity outside China."
”美国卫生与公众服务部部长亚历克斯·阿扎尔(Alex Azar) 2月25日告诉国会，美国已经储备了大约3000万个N95口罩，但在疫情爆发期间可能需要多达3亿个。
Alex Azar, the US health and human services secretary, told Congress on Feb. 25 that the US already has a stockpile of about 30m N95 masks, but as many as 300 million may be needed during the outbreak.
中国商务部外贸司司长李兴乾3月5日在商务部举行的网上例行新闻发布会上介绍，中国是全球口罩生产大国，每年出口数量稳定在生产规模的70%以上。
China is a major producer of face masks in the world, with annual exports stabilizing at more than 70 percent of the production scale, Li Xingqian, director of the Ministry of Commerce's foreign trade department, told a regular online news conference held by the Ministry of Commerce on March 5.
口罩属于自由贸易产品，中国政府未设置任何贸易管制措施。
The mask is a free-trade product and the Chinese government has no trade controls in place.
尽管中国口罩产能产量得到快速提升，供需状况有了较大改善，但随着各类企业大范围复工复产，口罩需求仍处于高位，存在较大供应缺口。
Although the production capacity of Chinese masks has been improved rapidly and the supply and demand situation has improved greatly, the demand for masks is still at a high level and there is a large supply gap as various enterprises resume production on a large scale.
在前一阶段疫情防控工作中，不少国家向中国伸出了援手，中国愿意在克服自身困难的同时，在口罩等医疗防护物资方面给予有关国家力所能及的援助。
During the previous period, many countries offered assistance to China in the prevention and control of the epidemic.While overcoming its own difficulties, China is willing to provide assistance to the countries concerned in terms of medical and protective materials such as masks.
