部分深圳留学生家长只能考虑让孩子在香港转机飞回内地其他城市后再回深圳，要么彻底不让孩子回中国内地虽香港尚未进行社区封闭，各种人多密集场所也并未暂停营业。
Some parents of Shenzhen students can only consider returning their children to Shenzhen after connecting flights to other cities in the Mainland, or not allowing their children to return to Mainland China. Although Hong Kong has not yet been closed to the community, various crowded places have not been suspended.
但人们在外出活动时，已非常注意彼此相隔更长距离。
But when people go out to work, they are very careful not to travel long distances.
文|《财经》特派香港记者 焦建编辑|苏琦鉴于新冠肺炎疫情全球蔓延，从3月19日零时开始，所有由外国入境中国香港特别行政区（下简称“香港”）的人士，都必须接受14日强制检疫或医学监察。
With the global spread of the New Crown Pneumonia epidemic, all foreign visitors to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China (hereinafter referred to as "Hong Kong") must undergo mandatory quarantine or medical surveillance on March 14.
根据中国香港特区政府行政长官林郑月娥在3月17日时公布的新规定：由于全球疫情不断升级，特区政府在过去一个星期内三次发布红色外游警示，宣布实施针对相关来源地入境人士的卫生检疫安排，包括日本北海道、申根地区国家、爱尔兰、英国、美国等。
Following is a question by the Hon Alan Leong and a written reply by the Secretary for the Environment, Transport and Works, Dr Sarah Liao, in the Legislative Council today (March 17):
自3月17日起，特区政府的红色外游警示将扩大到除内地、澳门及台湾外的全球所有国家和地区。
Since March 17, the red alert for outbound travel will be extended to all countries and regions of the world except the Mainland, Macao and Taiwan.
林郑月娥在3月17日出席行政会议前向媒体表示：过去两周香港新增57例新冠病毒感染病例，其中约九成是输入性病例或其密切接触者。
Before attending the Executive Council meeting on 17 March, Mrs Lam said that about 90% of the 57 new cases of Crested Infection in Hong Kong in the past two weeks were imported cases or close contacts.
目前香港的防疫焦点已经转变为防止境外输入，如不采取严格管控措施以阻止输入性病例在社区传播，过去两个多月来的防疫工作将前功尽弃。
At present, the focus of Hong Kong's epidemic prevention efforts has shifted to the prevention of foreign imports. Without strict control measures to prevent the spread of imported cases in the community, the immunization efforts of the past two months or more have been reversed.
此外，因有不少在英美国家留学的香港学生准备返回香港，她已经与国泰航空商讨采取增加航班和使用大型飞机的措施帮助留学生返港。
In addition, as many Hong Kong students studying in Britain and the United States are preparing to return to Hong Kong, she has discussed with Cathay Pacific about additional flights and the use of large aircraft to help students return to Hong Kong.
在照顾到香港学生返港的同时，希望通过香港返回深圳或华南其他地区的学生及旅客，处境则极为艰难。
Students and visitors who wish to return to Shenzhen or other parts of South China through Hong Kong are in an extremely difficult situation while taking into account the return of Hong Kong students to Hong Kong.
近期令大量深圳学生家长感到焦虑的，是按照香港的相关规定：所有从美英等疫情高发国家入境香港的非香港居民，若证件（港澳通行证等）有效签注期不够14天，将无法持中国内地护照入境香港。
A large number of parents of Shenzhen students have been worried recently about Hong Kong's requirement that all non-Hong Kong residents who enter Hong Kong from countries with high incidence of diseases such as the United States and the United Kingdom will not be able to enter Hong Kong with Mainland Chinese passports if their valid endorsement period is less than 14 days.
在此之前，因香港国际航班较多且价格较具竞争力，是粤港澳大湾区内大量居民出国的主要中转地。
Prior to that, Hong Kong's relatively large number of international flights and competitive prices made it a major transit point for a large number of residents from the Tai Wan area.
而近期深圳、广州等地已经停飞大量航班，依然保留大量国际航班的香港国际机场是大量华南片区人员归国的主要通道。
But recently Shenzhen, Guangzhou and other places have stopped a large number of flights, still retain a large number of international flights, the Hong Kong International Airport is a large number of South China's major return routes.
按照以往惯例，除赴港商务签注及探亲签注的有效期为单次最高三个月之外，内地居民在港旅游签注的有效期为七天。
In accordance with past practice, unless the business endorsement and family visit endorsement are valid for a single period of up to three months, Mainland residents' travel endorsement in Hong Kong is valid for seven days.
在数年前，深圳户籍居民的签注政策亦由此前的“一周多行”变为“一周一行”，单次在港最长时间亦为七天。
A few years ago, the endorsement policy for Shenzhen residents was changed from "more than one week" to "one line a week" and the maximum time for a single trip was seven days.
香港的新规定意味着除持有赴港商务签注及探亲签注之外的内地居民，将无法像以往一样经香港入境后再返回国内其他城市。
The new requirements in Hong Kong mean that Mainland residents other than those holding business endorsement and family visit endorsement will not be able to return to other cities in Hong Kong after entering Hong Kong as in the past.
据《财经》此前相关报道：为减少人流、进一步整合口岸管制区，从2月4日零时起，罗湖、落马洲、皇岗口岸，以及港澳码头被香港特区政府暂时关闭。
To reduce the flow of people and further consolidate the control zone at the port, Lo Wu, Lok Ma Chau, Huanggang Port and the Hong Kong Macau Ferry Terminal have been temporarily closed by the HKSAR Government since 0000 hours on February 4.
这是当地继1月30日起采取关闭6个口岸等抗疫措施之外的进一步举措。
This is in addition to the local response to the epidemic, which began on 30 January with the closure of six border crossings.
目前香港的出入境口岸仅剩3个，分别是香港国际机场、港珠澳大桥的香港口岸和深圳湾口岸。
At present, there are only three entry and exit points in Hong Kong, namely the Hong Kong International Airport, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge and the Shenzhen Bay Port.
与香港仅一河之隔的深圳，目前大部分口岸也已经关闭。
Shenzhen, just across a river from Hong Kong, has now closed most of its ports.
深圳湾口岸是深港之间唯一一个对出入境旅客开放的通道。
Shenzhen Bay Port is the only gateway between Shenzhen and Hong Kong open to incoming and outgoing passengers.
近日经香港回国旅客以及深圳籍留学生入境主要经过这条通道；另外一条通道，则是经香港经港珠澳大桥至澳门后回珠海。
Recent arrivals from Hong Kong and Shenzhen are mainly through this route, while the other is through Hong Kong via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge back to Zhuhai.
按照3月16日下午中国澳门特区政府宣布的消息：自3月17日零时起，所有在入境前14天内曾到过中国内地、中国香港、中国台湾以外的国家和地区的人士，入境后都必须在卫生当局指定的地点接受14日隔离医学观察。
Since 0000 hours on March 17, all persons who have travelled to countries and regions other than the Mainland of China, Hong Kong, China, or Taiwan Province of China during the 14 days prior to their arrival must undergo 14 days of medical observation at a location designated by the health authorities, according to information announced by the MSAR Government on the afternoon of March 16.
自2月22日以来，深圳连续多例新增病例亦皆为境外输入，绝大多数都是通过深圳湾口岸。
Since February 22, there have been a number of new cases imported from Shenzhen. The vast majority of these cases have passed through the Shenzhen Bay Port.
为加强防范，深圳各区域防疫人员近日亦在深圳湾口岸关口严阵以待，各自负责属于该区内的归国人员。
To strengthen preventive measures, Shenzhen regional anti-epidemic officers have also taken up their duties at the Shenzhen Bay Port gate in recent days.

为了克服政策之间不衔接带来的“有家难回”问题，越来越多的深圳留学生家长们近日正在积极呼吁有关方面可否打通香港至深圳蛇口之间的关口，方便孩子们回深圳隔离；或者直接派车到香港机场接应孩子。
More and more parents of Shenzhen students are calling for an opening between Hong Kong and Shenzhen to ease their children's journey back to Shenzhen, or send cars directly to Hong Kong airport to pick up their children.
“香港方面是否可以放开关闭不久的水上通道，可以在不入境香港的情况下，直接由香港机场的码头坐船到蛇口码头（或深圳机场码头）、珠海九州港码头。
"Can Hong Kong relax the closure of the near future waterway by boat directly from the terminal of Hong Kong Airport to Shekou Pier (or Shenzhen Airport Pier) and Zhuhai Kyushu Port Pier without entering Hong Kong?
在香港宣布疫情政策之前，这两条水上通道本身就在如此运作。
Before Hong Kong's declaration of the epidemic, the two waterways themselves operated.
这样也不影响香港防疫，还能保持香港机场的航班航线数量；此外，‘滞港留学生逾越不过的深圳湾’不仅是深港防疫的新课题，也是深港融合的新机遇。
This will not affect Hong Kong's epidemic prevention and maintain the number of flight routes at the Hong Kong airport. Besides, Shenzhen Bay, which is not only a new subject for Hong Kong and Shenzhen students, but also a new opportunity for the integration of Shenzhen and Hong Kong.
实际上，十几年前深港合作正热时，便有人提出深圳机场与香港机场应加强配合，香港主打国际航线，深圳主打国内航线，两个机场之间开辟专门路上通道（两个机场现有水上通道，但是因为天气等特殊原因水上通道并不能保证两地机场全天候衔接），抵达香港机场的人员，可以不入境香港，直接坐车到深圳机场搭乘国内航班。
In fact, when Shenzhen Airport and Hong Kong Airport were working together more than a decade ago, it was suggested that the Shenzhen Airport and the Hong Kong Airport should cooperate more closely. Hong Kong's main international route is Shenzhen's main domestic route.
反过来，从深圳出国也是一样，不入境香港。
On the other hand, going abroad from Shenzhen is the same.
”近日与多位深圳留学生家长接触的“深圳客”公众号负责人对《财经》记者分析。
"Recently with a number of parents of Shenzhen students contact the" Shenzhen guest "the public responsible for the" Caijing "reporter analysis.
此外其还表示：在港珠澳大桥确定单Y方案的时候，由于大桥没有连上深圳，也有人提出建设一条经过香港但不入境的陆上通道，让深圳的车辆不必绕经虎门，而是直接上港珠澳大桥抵达珠海、江门等珠三角西岸城市。
At the time of the establishment of the single Y option, a new overland route through Hong Kong but not into Shenzhen was also proposed so that vehicles from Shenzhen would not have to cross the Humen Gate, but would go directly to Zhuhai-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge and other cities in the Pearl River Delta.
这样不但方便了深圳，也提高了大桥的使用率。
This not only facilitated Shenzhen, but also increased the use of the bridge.
即便是现在已经开工建设深中大桥，从这次疫情来看，深港还需要一条更快的通道。
Even with the construction of the Shenzhen-Zhongqiao already under way, Shenzhen and Hong Kong need a faster route from this outbreak.
上述建议短期内无法实现的前提下，部分深圳留学生家长开始考虑让孩子在香港转机飞回中国内地其他城市后再回深圳，要么彻底不让孩子回中国内地。
In the absence of such a proposal in the short term, some parents of Shenzhen students are considering sending their children back to Shenzhen after transiting through Hong Kong to other Chinese cities, or not allowing their children to return to China altogether.
