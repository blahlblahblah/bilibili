_各地的隔离措施在阻断疫情传播人流的同时，也阻断了货运物流，这成了许多制造企业复工的难题；此外，防控措施和复工审批进程也给复工前景增添了变数_文|《财经》记者 韩舒淋编辑 |余乐疫情之下，科技公司还能借助各种技术手段在家云办公，而离不开工厂的实体制造业，面临的困难就复杂的多。
While blocking the spread of the epidemic, quarantine measures around the world have also disrupted freight logistics, a challenge for many manufacturers to resume work. In addition, control measures and the resumption-of-work approval process have added some variables to their work prospects.
各类制造业普遍有复杂的产业链，一家企业只是产业链上的一环，如果企业上下游没有复工，那么单个企业就很难有复工的条件，而疫情阻断的各类交通也中断了产业链企业间的物流，这正在成为制造企业复工的第一大挑战。
A complex industrial chain is common in all types of manufacturing industries, an enterprise is only one link in the industrial chain. If enterprises do not return to work upstream and downstream, it is very difficult for individual enterprises to have the conditions to return to work.
防护物资短缺是另一大困难，为了满足当地复工的防疫要求，如口罩、消毒液、测温设备等各类防护物资目前还普遍存在储备不足的问题，不过《财经》记者接触的多家企业而言，或者通过自己想办法找各种渠道，或者通过高于平时价格购买，甚至有地方政府可以调配当地产能来服务当地制造企业，这一问题虽然紧迫，但并非完全没有办法。
The shortage of protective materials is another major difficulty. To meet the local requirements of returning to work, there is still a general shortage of protective materials such as masks, disinfectants, temperature measuring equipment, etc. However, many enterprises contacted by Caijing either find their own ways or buy them at higher-than-usual prices, and even local governments can deploy local capacity to service local manufacturers.
此外，疫情还未缓解的当下，许多地区依然对人员流动控制严格，且要求外地返工人回需要先自我隔离14天。
In addition, at a time when the epidemic has not abated, many areas still maintain strict controls on the movement of persons and require returning workers to remain in self-segregation for 14 days.
这不仅阻断了人员的流动，即便能回到企业的员工，短时间内也无法回到生产一线，当前能够复工或者部分复工的企业，都需要依靠本地员工。
Not only does this cut off the flow of workers, but even those who do return to work will not be able to return to work anytime soon. Companies that can now resume work, or part of it, rely on local staff.
而许多企业的管理和技术人员都并不在当地，这也给企业带来了困难。
Many of the company's management and technical staff are not there, which also brings difficulties to the enterprise.
多重因素下，许多制造企业的复工前景目前仍不明朗。
The prospects for many manufacturing companies to return to work remain uncertain, given multiple factors.
以制造业的代表汽车制造业为例。
Consider the manufacturing industry, which represents the automobile industry.
汽车制造业体量巨大，国内汽车制造业产业总产值占GDP将近10%，且产业链长，分工细致，产业链上集中了大量的中小民营企业。
The total output value of the domestic automobile manufacturing industry is nearly 10% of GDP, and the industrial chain is long and meticulous, with a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises concentrated in the industrial chain.
当前汽车制造业基本处在待命状态，在等待整车主机厂的复工指令，而主机厂何时能够复工尚无明确消息。
Automobile manufacturers are basically in a state of readiness, waiting for the return of the entire vehicle factory, and when the main plant will be able to resume work.
“如果这个月底还不能复工，这个行业就要垮了”，一家江苏的汽车零部件一级供应商企业负责人对《财经》记者表示。
"If we can't get back to work by the end of this month, the industry is going to collapse," the head of a Jiangsu-based supplier of auto parts told Caijing.
据他介绍，过完年后很早就曾接到几家下游整车主机厂的调查信息，询问供应能否有保障，虽然此前主机厂计划在2月17日复工，但需要根据产业链的保障情况来定，目前仍然没有确定的消息。
Earlier this year, he said, he had received information from several downstream processors asking whether supplies would be guaranteed and that although the main plant was scheduled to resume work on 17 February, it would need to be determined in the light of the security of the industrial chain.
该负责人表示，下属的几家工厂利用当地员工可以部分复工。
The director said several of the factories under his command could be partially reinstated with local staff.
不过关键是汽车零部件行业产业链长，很担心如果自己复工，产业链上游的原材料供应不了怎么办，其部分原材料需要从长三角和海外进口，但现在物流渠道基本完全中断，何时恢复没有定论，如果开工，后续没有原材料能够生产，而且即便自己做出来供了一批货，如果产业链其他公司没有复工，车厂做不出来车，接下来还是要停工，而且资金也无法周转。
However, the key is the auto parts industry chain long, worried that if they go back to work, the industry chain upstream raw materials can not do, some of their raw materials need to be imported from the Yangtze River Delta and overseas.
国内疫情对海外市场的的影响也将逐渐显现。
The impact of the domestic epidemic on overseas markets will also gradually become apparent.
以该零部件厂商为例，其有特有零部件也供应海外知名车企的部分车型，且全球仅此一家供应商，要寻找替代零部件厂商需要重新进行相关开发、检测流程，至少需要半年，因此，该零部件厂商供货的海外车企部分车型已经确定将在几个月后出现缺货。
The parts maker, for example, also supplies some models from well-known overseas auto makers -- the only supplier in the world -- and will need at least half a year to redevelop and test alternative parts companies, so some of the models supplied by the parts maker are set to go out of stock in a few months.
疫情稳定地区，体量更小且有出口业务的公司相对好调头，辽宁的一家小型汽车零部件供应商对《财经》记者表示，当地疫情相对平稳，员工都是本地员工，员工数量只有十余人，因此对防护物资需求不大，储备足够使用一个多月，目前生产的零部件可出口日本韩国，且国际物流将在10号后恢复，在此前向政府提交相关审批材料后，今日已经如期复工，且园区内大部分企业都已经复工。
A small car parts supplier in Liaoning told Caijing that the epidemic was relatively stable, with local employees and only a dozen employees, so there was little need for protective equipment. The spare parts could be exported to Japan and Korea for more than a month.
不过，即便复工，该企业当前生产的零部件全部供应日本、韩国的海外客户，国内客户仍在等在主机厂的消息。
But even if it resumes work, all of the components it currently produces are destined for overseas customers in Japan and South Korea, with domestic customers still waiting to hear from the main plant.
车厂让什么时候复工就什么时候复工，是目前汽车制造业面临的基本现状。
At present, the automobile industry is faced with the basic status quo when the depot should resume work.
而让整个产业链恢复运作，物流渠道打通必不可少，但疫情之下，《财经》记者采访多家企业的反馈显示，目前国内只有与防疫物资生产相关的物流渠道可以由政府开辟绿色通道，其余行业物流几乎陷入停滞。
But under the epidemic situation, the feedback from Caijing reporter who interviewed many enterprises shows that at present, only the logistics channel related to epidemic prevention material production can be opened by the government, and the logistics of the remaining industries are almost at a standstill.
前述江苏的零部件商负责人因此对《财经》记者表示，控制客运可以理解，但希望政府能够放开企业生产的货运物流。
The head of Jiangsu's component business thus told Caijing that controlling passenger transport was understandable, but he wanted the government to liberalize freight logistics produced by companies.
现在物流停滞，只能逼企业自己想办法出去采购，也增加了风险，而大的物流企业更有能力集中做消毒防护工作，“让大卡车跑起来”，该负责人表示。
Stagnation in logistics is forcing companies to do their own shopping and increasing risk, while big logistics companies are better able to focus on disinfection protection and "get big trucks running," the director said.
物流中断的影响，已经成为多个领域制造企业复工的头号难题。
Logistics disruption has become the most difficult problem for manufacturing enterprises to resume work in many fields.
一家浙江的电气制造企业负责人对《财经》记者表示，目前企业储备的原材料只有三四天的库存，未来出货肯定有问题，原材料运输主要靠公路，但目前高速公路都封锁了，司机出去一趟回来还要隔离十四天，进出物流都有困难。
'There are only three or four days of stocks left in stock, and future shipments are bound to be problematic, 'a Zhejiang electrical producer told Caijing.' Raw materials are shipped mainly by road, but now highways are blocked and drivers have to be quarantined for 14 days and have difficulty getting in and out of the logistics.
即便是防疫物资相关企业，复工也受到物流影响。
Even for enterprises concerned with epidemic prevention, the resumption of work is affected by logistics.
一家长三角的口罩设备供应商对《财经》记者表示，当地的元器件市场还未开门，现在虽然已经申请复工，但产业链不恢复无法开工，此外，也有不少上游原材料是温州的供应商提供，当前温州疫情严重，物流渠道也非常困难。
A supplier of mask equipment in the Yangtze River Delta told Caijing that the local component market had not yet opened, and although it had applied to resume work, the industrial chain would not be able to start work.
目前只能希望2月下旬市场恢复之后可以快速投入生产。
It can only be hoped that production will begin soon after markets resume in late February.
不过另一问题是，疫情之下政府的审慎管理，也是企业复工必须迈过去的坎。
The other problem, however, is that prudent government management in the face of the epidemic is where companies must go back to work.
前述电气制造企业负责人对《财经》记者介绍，目前已向政府提交了审批材料。
The aforementioned chief of the electrical manufacturing enterprises told Caijing that approval materials have been submitted to the government.
但何时能够获批并无明确消息。
But there is no clear message as to when it will be approved.
他表示，政府人手有限，而现在几千家企业等着排队。
He said the government had limited staff and thousands of businesses were now waiting in line.
基层政府加码的疫情控制，也让企业面临困难。
Grass-roots government to increase the control of the epidemic, enterprises also face difficulties.
该负责人戏称，“现在是村长比区长还大”，当地不少企业在地方乡村，为了确保本地疫情的控制，人员流动控制和复工审批在基层政府往往更加严格，“村里的制度和上面完全不一样”，企业复工面临更大的困难。
"The village chief is bigger than the district mayor," the official jokingly said. "Many local companies are working in local villages. To ensure local epidemic control, movement control and work approval are often stricter at the grass-roots level.
多家企业都希望政府能有更明确的复工要求和时间预期，建议根据疫情有更精细的管理。
Companies are hoping the government will have clearer requirements and timelines for returning to work, suggesting finer management in the light of the outbreak.
该企业负责人表示，当地目前根据企业的重要性对复工批次有大致的先后要求，除了防疫物资企业外，首批企业是当地的重点大型企业，但后续其他企业能不能开工，何时开工，还没有明确信息。
The company's director said there were broad priorities for the resumption batch based on the importance of the company, with the exception of the anti-epidemic enterprise, where the first batch was a major local enterprise, but there was no clear information as to whether and when other companies would be able to start.
他建议，地方政府掌握疫情发生的具体信息，能否做一个区分，没有发生疫情的园区、开发区先开工，而不是现在一刀切全部停掉。
He suggested that local governments have specific information on the occurrence of the epidemic, and whether a distinction could be made between starting work in parks and development zones where outbreaks do not occur, rather than stopping them all at once.
亦有制造企业负责人对《财经》记者表示，目前基层政府出台的复工相关措施，几乎要求企业法人承担无限的防疫责任，但企业本身也做不了严密的预先排查，还需要政府的防控部门来共同配合。
There are also manufacturing enterprises in charge of "Caijing" told Caijing, the current measures introduced by the grass-roots government on the resumption of work, almost require the enterprise legal person to undertake unlimited immunization responsibilities, but the enterprises themselves can not do rigorous pre-screening, and government control departments will need to work together.
