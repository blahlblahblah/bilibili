记者/杨宝璐编辑/宋建华武汉市红十字会的志愿者们在疫情中心武汉，街头空空荡荡，但仍不断有志愿者穿梭在物资仓库、医院、高速路口运送防护物资。
Volunteers from the Red Cross in Wuhan, the epicentre of the epidemic, are empty, but volunteers are still shuttling through warehouses, hospitals and high-speed junctions carrying protective goods.
物资源源不断地运送进来，但1月31日，越来越多呈现在人们眼前的，却是武汉若干定点医院物资领取困难的消息。
A steady flow of supplies arrived, but on January 31, more and more people were presented with the news that some designated hospitals in Wuhan were in a difficult situation.
2月1日，中国红十字工作组赶赴武汉，指导、督促湖北省、武汉市两级红十字会做好捐赠款物的接收使用管理工作，确保规范高效、公开透明，主动接受社会监督，为一线医护人员提供有力支援。
On February 1, the Chinese Red Cross team went to Wuhan to guide and urge the Red Cross societies at both the Hubei and Wuhan levels to do a good job in receiving and using donations.
同一天，武汉市红十字会对定向捐赠流程作出调整：境内外单位或个人如有定向捐赠医院，可直接与定向捐赠医疗机构对接，确认后可直接将物资发往受捐单位。
On the same day, the Wuhan Red Cross made adjustments to the flow of targeted donations: units or individuals inside or outside the country who have a targeted donation hospital may directly dock with the designated donation medical institution, after which they may send the materials directly to the recipient unit.
而此时，汪慧已经将自己志愿者工作的重心，从红十字会的接线员转移到了为民间慈善组织运输物资上。
By this time, Wang Hui had shifted the focus of her volunteer work from the Red Cross operator to shipping supplies for non-governmental charities.
在她看来，这是一条更加直接有效的途径。
In her view, that was a more direct and effective approach.
湖北省红十字会官网：对物资分配中存在的问题深感痛心，全程接受纪检监察部门监督，接受广大媒体和网民的监督志愿者24小时三班倒深一度：你是退出红十字会志愿者团队了吗？汪慧：其实不算退出，在红十字会做志愿者是大家自由排班，你可以选择排班，也可以不，我还在那个群里，但我最近没有主动要求排班了，那样也就不会排到我。
Hubei Red Cross official website: Deeply distressed about the existing problems in the distribution of materials, accepted the supervision of discipline inspection and supervision departments, accepted the vast media and netizens supervision volunteers 24-hour three-shift? Wang Hui: Actually not exit, you can choose to work in the Red Cross, or not, I am still in that group, but I have not asked for a shift recently.
深一度：武汉红十字会志愿者岗位大概有几类？各有多少人？汪慧：主要是电话接听，物资搬运、仓库管理三块，还有一些零散的，比如后勤保障。
How many people are there in Wuhan Red Cross? Wang Hui: Mainly telephone, material handling, warehouse management, and some scattered, such as logistics.
其中最大的组就是电话接听组，因为有很多部热线电话，再就是仓库管理和帮忙运输的，但人手都不是很多。
The largest group was the telephone answering group, which had many hotlines, warehouse management and transportation, but not many.
目前接听组人最多，大概有一百人左右，仓库管理和物资搬运这块我知道的大概有三四十人。
There are about a hundred people in the reception group, and I know about thirty or forty people in the warehouse management and material handling.
深一度：仓库管理是指国博的仓库吗？汪慧：对，是国博的仓库，之前还有国药控股集团在光谷那边的仓库，是武汉最大的一家医药公司，有比较好的存储条件，但仓库不够大，很快堆满了，后来才换到国博的仓库。
WANG Hui: Yes, it is the warehouse of Guobao, and before that, the warehouse of Guobao Holding Group is the biggest one in Wuhan. It has better storage condition, but the warehouse is not big enough, it is full quickly, and then moved to the warehouse of Guobo.
仓库管理除了每天负责清点的志愿者，更多的是帮忙上下搬运货物的志愿者。
In addition to the volunteers who were in charge of the daily inventory, the warehouse was staffed by volunteers who helped move the goods up and down.
深一度：这些志愿者是长期的，还是肺炎疫情专门招募的？汪慧：我是在红十字会微信公众号博爱江城看到的招募信息，当时发了几条紧急公告，说急缺接线员，当时是要求招募50个志愿者，我报了名。
WANG Hui: I saw the recruitment message in the Red Cross Weixin Public fraternity city, when I made several urgent announcements about the urgent need for operators, when I applied for 50 volunteers.
我感觉大部分、至少接线员中的大部分都是因为这次肺炎疫情而临时来的。
I feel that most, or at least most, of the operators have come on an ad hoc basis because of the pneumonia.
深一度：接听组的工作是怎样的？汪慧：接听组是这样，有人今天有时间，有人没有，还有人临时身体不舒服，所以是轮换的。
One degree: What is the work of the listening groupWang Hui: Yes, there are some people who have time today, some who don't, and some who are temporarily unwell, so they rotate.
工作时间是24小时三班倒，晚上的班会长一点，因为电话少一些。
Hours of work are three shifts a day, and the shift at night is a little longer because there are fewer calls.
白天特别忙，电话就没断过，所以时间短一点，我早上值班差不多6个半小时到7个小时，反正保证必须等下一班的人来了，换你这班，你才能离开接听座位。
The day is very busy, the phone never stops, so the time is shorter, I am on duty almost six and a half hours to seven hours in the morning, anyway I have to wait for the next shift, change your shift, you can not leave the answer seat.
深一度：仓库管理那边也是24小时三班倒吗？汪慧：是的。
Once upon a time: Is there a 24-hour triple shift over there in the warehouse managementWang Hui: Yes.
深一度：存在人手不够的情况吗？汪慧：这两天志愿者群里面很多人就没报排班了，之前——至少到我去的最后一天（1月29日），人手是绝对够的，每一班都是满满的。
Once upon a time: Is there a shortage of staff? Wang Hui: Many of the volunteers have not reported scheduled work for the past two days. Before that, at least on the last day of my trip (January 29), there were enough people in every class.
深一度：搬运物资是红十字会把物资送到医院，还是医院自己来取？汪慧：都有。
Once in a blue moon: Does the Red Cross carry supplies to the hospital, or does the hospital itself pick it upWang Hui: Yes.
红十字会最早是希望能够把物资送到医院去，但后来发现（都送到医院）人手、车都不够，所以后来变成了如果医院很急，又是定向捐赠，医院可以自己派车来拿，因为确实没有那么多车，红会的车甚至还要去高速路口接一些没法运进城的物资。
The Red Cross had originally hoped to get supplies to the hospital, but when it found out that there were not enough staff and cars, it turned out that if the hospital was in a hurry and there was a targeted donation, the hospital could send its own car to pick it up, because there were not so many cars and the Red Cross even had to go to the motorway to pick up supplies that couldn't get into town.
接听组的微信群截图提意见结果被踢出群深一度：听说有志愿者提了一些意见？汪慧：现在网上提到的那些意见，我们都提过。
The response to the microphone group screenshots was kicked out of the group for a while: I heard that some volunteers had made some comments? Wang Hui: We have all mentioned the ideas mentioned on the Internet now.
同时我们自己在工作中发现的一些问题也提过。
At the same time, some of the problems we have found in our work have also been raised.
我们值班的组长、负责人，其实都只是志愿者，只有红十字会的正式工作人员有资格拍板决定一些事情，所以我们反映上去的意见，组长他们也没办法做决定，每次回答都是我们往上报，你们等一等，然后就没有下文了。
Our shift leader and supervisor, in fact, are all volunteers. Only the official staff of the Red Cross are qualified to make decisions, so we reflect on our views, and the team leaders have no way of making decisions.
所以后来大家就在群里直接@能拍板决定事情的人，但结果是提意见的人直接被踢掉了。
So then we went straight to the person in the group who was able to make a decision, but the person making the comment was kicked out.
深一度：具体反映的意见有什么？汪慧：比如说账目公开，大家看到网上那些消息，很多志愿者觉得应该好好做一下账目公开这块，我们志愿者可以帮助核账、清点物资、公开信息，但都没有被采纳。
What are some suggestions? Wang Hui: For example, the accounts are open, people see the news on the Internet, many volunteers feel that they should do a good job of accounting disclosure, and our volunteers can help check the accounts, count the goods and make the information public, but they have not been accepted.
我个人提过建议，有些手续可以简化一点，之前我们接电话，有些物资（捐赠者）是想直接送到医院比较快，或者有别的原因比较急，但顺丰如果想走绿色通道，必须要有红十字会出具的说明或者接收函。
I personally suggested that some procedures could be simplified. Before we answered the phone, some things (donors) wanted to go directly to the hospital faster, or there were other urgent reasons, but Shunfeng would have to have a note or a letter of acceptance from the Red Cross if it wanted to go through the Green Channel.
但红十字会说，如果物资不是往我们这边运，我们没办法核查，不能开这个函。
But the Red Cross said that if the goods were not shipped to us, we would not be able to verify that this letter could not be issued.
我们当时就建议说，那我们可以派些工作人员去高速路口或仓库或医院，去那里清点，看没问题就帮着开函，或者让医院先出个证明，说明确实这批物资是送到医院的，我们红十字会就开这个证明，这样物资不就可以很顺利的运进来吗？但红会的工作人员说这是要背责的，他们没有被授予这个权限，所以就统统不可以。
We suggested that we send some of our staff to high-speed intersections or warehouses or hospitals, go there and check them out to see if there were any problems, or ask the hospital to issue a certificate stating that the goods were actually sent to the hospital.
我们当时说你们可以往上反映一下，但并没有用。
We said you could reflect on it, but it didn't help.
还有，就是要求红会给我们的培训材料一定要准确。
Also, ask the Red Cross to give us training materials must be accurate.
比方说，最早红十字会是可以接受海外捐赠的，后来因为能力不够，就把这一部分分给了湖北省慈善总会，培训单子上写了湖北省慈善总会的座机、包括海关的电话，让我们给别人报号码，让捐赠人自行去对接。
For example, the first Red Cross Society was allowed to accept donations from overseas, but later, because it was unable to do so, it was distributed to the Hubei Charity Association.
但我们在那几天接到过无数电话，告诉我们电话全是错的。
But we received countless phone calls in the past few days, telling us it was all wrong.
我们反映过很多次电话号码有误，但都没有改。
We have complained many times of incorrect phone numbers, but none of them has been changed.
深一度：你所在的群里，因为提意见被踢的人有多少？汪慧：没有具体统计过，但我知道每天都有。
Once upon a time: In your group, how many people were kicked for asking advice? Wang Hui: No statistics, but I know every day.
因为总会有志愿者看不过眼，但大部分人像我一样，后来就不说话了，一开始你想说的问题被别人说了，然后他们被踢了之后，你就不想再去跟他们争了，觉得没有意义。
Because there will always be volunteers who don't see eye to eye, but most people, like me, don't talk later. At first what you want to say is said, and then they get kicked, and you don't want to argue with them anymore.
深一度：你所在的群踢人的是志愿者组长还是正式员工？汪慧：是正式员工，因为她是负责志愿者招募的，我们报名什么的都要通过她，她在群里负责排班。
Once in a while: Is your group a volunteer leader or a regular employee? Wang Hui: She's a regular employee, because she's in charge of volunteer recruitment, we sign up for anything, and she's in charge of the shift in the group.
深一度：她有说过搜集志愿者意见上报的话吗？汪慧：没有说过。
Once upon a time: Did she say anything about collecting volunteer opinions? Wang Hui: Not really.
深一度：志愿者除了在群里提意见，还有没有其它途径上报意见？汪慧：每值完一个班，会开一个简单的总结会，总结一下今天哪些电话比较重要，什么事情我们解决不了，需要工作人员去解决，但基本上只是就事论事。
Once upon a time, there are no other ways for volunteers to report their opinions except in groups? Wang Hui: After each class, we have a simple summary meeting to summarize what is important and what we can't solve today.
我们提的意见都比较宏观，比如顺丰绿色通道应该帮助盖章，直接就一票否了。
We put forward a relatively macroscopic view, such as Shunfeng green channel should help seal, one vote directly or not.
还比如说我们觉得工作方式应该怎么改进的，基本没有被采纳过。
For example, how we feel we should improve the way we work has been largely ignored.
深一度：意见没有被采纳，红十字会有没有具体的不予采纳的原因？汪慧：有，我之所以觉得很不舒服的是，其实他们的理由我都能接受，但他们应该向上汇报才对。
WANG Hui: Yes, the reason why I feel uncomfortable is that I can accept all their reasons, but they should report back to me.
比如还拿顺丰举例子，我们问为什么不能给他们盖章放行，红会的工作人员解释很简单：因为不在我们的执行范围内。
To take the example of Shunfeng, for example, we asked why they were not allowed to be stamped and the ICRC staff explained that it was simple: it was not within our means of implementation.
很多志愿者在群里说，我们知道仓库里有东西，能不能你们向上面汇报，快点分下去，红十字会就说这份职责不在我们这儿，我们没有权力做这个事。
'We know there's something in the warehouse, 'many volunteers said.' Could you report back to us? 'The Red Cross said it wasn't our job. We didn't have the right to do it.
给我们的感觉就是，这个事解决不了。
The feeling we have is that this thing can't be solved.
Play武汉回应红十字会调拨物资问题：周转不够快怀疑自己做的到底值不值深一度：志愿者来工作有补贴吗？汪慧：没有。
Wuhan respond to the Red Cross allocation of materials: turnover is not fast enough to doubt that their work is worth a deep once: volunteers to work there subsidies? Wang Hui: No.
我们除了每天在那里吃一顿工作餐之外，不拿一毛钱。
We don't get a dime except for a working meal there every day.
深一度：志愿者负责接线、运输、仓库管理，那正式工作人员的工作内容是什么？汪慧：我知道的至少有两个人，一个工作人员是专门负责财务，每天要核一下账目，因为账全部都打到红十字会的账户里。
WANG Hui: I know at least two people, a staff member is in charge of finance, and I have to check the accounts every day, because all the accounts are in the Red Cross account.
另外还有一个工作人员是二楼捐赠大厅，专门用来开各种凭证的，比如出城的凭证，由其负责盖章。
There is also a staff member on the second floor of the donation hall, which is used to issue vouchers, such as those for leaving the city, which are responsible for stamping.
还有几个男性工作人员在仓库那边，负责需要拍板决定的事，比如说有医院来取物资，只有他们才能够决定能不能拿走，志愿者听他们指挥，他们应该是在负责跟指挥部、卫健委对接。
There were also a few male staff at the warehouse who were responsible for the decisions that needed to be made, such as getting supplies from hospitals. Only they could decide whether to take them. Volunteers were under their command.
深一度：你说有些志愿者怀疑自己做的事情到底值不值，为什么会有这样的想法？汪慧：目前志愿者没有受到公众质疑，很多人觉得我们这么辛苦，通宵熬夜，就是希望物资能够快点到医护人员手上。
Once upon a time, you said that some volunteers suspected that what they had done was not worth it, why did they think so? Wang Hui: At present, volunteers are not questioned by the public, many people think we work so hard and stay up all night just to get the supplies to the medical staff quickly.
但这件事情现在跟我们想的不一样，我们努力了，却没有达到我们想要的效果，会有一种很无奈无助的感觉。
But this matter is not the same as we think now, we tried hard, but did not achieve the desired effect, there will be a very helpless feeling.
每天我们接到电话，这边是各种好心人、各种捐东西，那边接到的电话是医院打来的，说急需物资，说东西在你们红十字会，而我们只能跟他们说我们没有办法，那种无助感真的很强烈。
Every day we get phone calls from all kinds of nice people and donations, and the phone calls from the hospital, saying there's a lot of stuff to say, things are at your Red Cross, and we just have to tell them we have nothing to do, and the feeling of helplessness is really strong.
今天（2月1日）听到还在接线的小伙伴说，大概意思就是开会让接线志愿者说得话要模棱两可一点，不要乱说或者乱做，让别人容易误会，然后在网上造谣的话。
Vicki: Well, if you have any questions, you can ask: What do you think is the best way to solve this problem? What do you think of this problem?
大家听了就很灰心。
"Hearing this, the crowd became discouraged.
深一度：最近两天志愿者招募不顺利吗？汪慧：我这两天观察了一下排班表，有几个跟我一样，就默默地没有报名排班了。
Wang Hui: I've been observing the schedule for the past two days, and some of them, like me, have not signed up for the class in silence.
之前每次排班都是满的，现在每次还要喊，比如说需要15个人，现在还差6个之类的，喊很久都不一定有足够的人报名。
Before each shift is full, now every time also need to shout, such as need 15 people, now still six or so, yell for a long time not necessarily enough people to sign up.
深一度：你觉得在民间公益组织作志愿者和在红十字会作志愿者有什么区别？汪慧：我们现在做民间慈善组织运输物资，没有繁杂的手续，很简单很直接。
Once upon a time, what do you think is the difference between volunteering at a non-governmental organization and volunteering at the Red Cross? Wang Hui: We are now a non-governmental charity that transports goods without complicated formalities.
比如说有些物资有的人愿意捐，但不符合医疗标准，我们就说没事，不符合医疗标准给我们也可以，我们再帮助找无需医疗标准物资的需求方。
For example, some people are willing to donate, but do not meet the medical standards, we say nothing, do not meet the medical standards for us can also be, we help find the medical standards of the demand side.
再比如，有些物资到了武汉进不来，没关系，我们义工有车，直接过去拉进来就是了。
For example, some supplies to Wuhan can not enter, it is all right, we volunteers have a car, directly past pull in.
有些是需要国外代购的求助，我们马上就在义工圈里面募捐，别管是需要3000块还是5000块，账目真的是筹完大概20分钟以后就公示给大家看，然后火速打给人家买东西。
Some of them are requests for help from abroad, and we immediately raise money in the volunteer circle, whether it's 3,000 dollars or 5,000 dollars. The books will really be ready in about 20 minutes, and then we'll have to call someone to do the shopping.
我们在武汉少说几千、上万个义工是有的，所以这种交流渠道特别快，账目也非常快。
We have thousands and tens of thousands of volunteers in Wuhan, so the channels of communication are very fast and the accounts are very fast.
我们平时经常做这些事，没有像红十字会那样几个亿，我们也就几千一两万，很快大家都能搞定。
We often do these things, not like the Red Cross hundreds of millions of people, we will be tens of thousands of 20, 000, soon everyone will be able to deal with.
但红十字会这边不是，比如说捐钱捐物，反正你打电话到这里来，把东西寄到这里，但是寄到之后，我得中间通过上级部门，跟他们进行对接，告诉他们现在红十字会的仓库里都放了哪些东西，然后上级部门再来分配给医院。
But the Red Cross is not, like donating money and gifts, you call in here and send things here, but when I get there, I have to go through the department and dock with them and tell them what's in the Red Cross warehouse now, and then the higher authority distributes it to the hospital.
而且有时候通知医院过来拿，有时候又是红十字会给送，然后送过去的东西，因为红十字会的人都不是专业的医疗工作人员，甚至送过去的东西都不一定是符合医院标准的。
Sometimes the hospital is notified to pick it up, and sometimes it is given by the Red Cross, which then delivers, because the Red Cross is not a professional medical worker, and even what is delivered is not necessarily up to hospital standards.
说白了，医院需要的东西和现在捐过来的东西，红会缺乏点对点直接快速对接的工作流程。
To put it bluntly, the Red Cross lacks a direct, point-to-point, quick docking process for what hospitals need and what they donate now.
