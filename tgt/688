入院12天，我发现客厅桌上的两条金鱼一直没喂食，依然生龙活虎。
After 12 days in hospital, I found two goldfish on the living room table that were still alive and well.
生命顽强，人一定比鱼更顽强。
Life is tenacious, man must be more tenacious than fish.
口述 |肖心诚整理 | 吴　雪在这场疫情袭来之前，我曾设想过我的2020年：挣多点钱，孝敬老人，和爱人浪漫出游……但从1月19日那天起，一切美好戛然而止，我的愿望清单上只剩下两个字：活着。
Before the epidemic struck, I had envisioned 2020: more money, more filial piety, a romantic getaway with a loved one... But as of January 19, all was quiet, and only two words remained on my wish list: to be alive.
1984年出生的我，是一名普通武汉市民，肖心诚是我的社交用名，因为我相信“诚实如金”。
Born in 1984, is an ordinary Wuhan city, Xiao Xincheng is my social name, because I believe in "honesty as gold."
2015年，我和爱人詹新相识结婚，在市区买了一套三居室的房子，生了一个可爱的女儿。
In 2015, I married my wife Zhan Xin, bought a three-bedroom house downtown and had a lovely daughter.
也是同年，我决定从银行辞职，和师兄创立了一家IT供应链管理公司。
It was also the same year that I decided to resign from the bank and start an IT supply chain management company with my brother.
作为合伙人，我日夜奔波，谈客户做项目，5年来，生意总算有了起色，一家三口日子过得还算殷实。
As a partner, I worked day and night and talked about projects with clients. In the past five years, my business has finally picked up and my family of three has been doing quite well.
1月18日，武汉的天气凉意甚浓，我像往常一样饭后出门消食，出门前翻了下日历，还有7天就要过年了，摸了摸渐长的头发，决定先去熟悉的理发店剪个板寸。
On January 18, the cold weather in Wuhan, as usual, I went out to eat dinner, turned out the next calendar, there are seven days to celebrate the New Year, feeling the long hair, decided to go to the familiar barber shop to cut an inch.
理发师很娴熟，很快剪好了。
The barber was so skilled that he cut it quickly.
我挥手道了别，又在外面散步了一个小时，当时武汉的街头几乎没有人戴口罩，大家都像往常一样该干嘛干嘛。
I waved goodbye and walked outside for another hour, when almost no one was wearing masks on the streets of Wuhan and everyone was doing what he usually did.
肖心诚在武汉的小区远眺　受访者供图晚上9点，回到家后感觉浑身发冷，还伴着少许咳嗽，爱人询问是不是着凉了，量了下体温正常，但为了安全起见，还是吃了感冒药。
Xiao Xincheng in the Wuhan community overlooking the interviewee at 9 pm, returned home feeling cold, with a little cough, the lover asked whether the cold, took a normal temperature, but to be safe, or took cold medicine.
第二天一早，额头开始发烫，一量38℃，发烧了。
The next morning, the forehead began to burn, a measurement of 38 degrees Celsius, fever.
因为爱人在一家医疗流通企业工作，经常给金银潭医院和儿童医院送检测试剂，多少知道些情况，她非常警觉地说：“你赶紧戴上口罩，我带你去社区打一针。
Because she works in a medical circulation company and often sends reagents to the gold and silver pool hospital and the children's hospital, she says warily, "You put on your mask, and I'll take you to the community for an injection.
”打完针后，第二天我的体温转为了低烧37.5℃，这天正好是我们公司的年会，因为当时钟南山院士还没有说有人传人的症状，纠结再三我决定戴着口罩参加。
After the injection, the next day my temperature turned to a low fever of 37.5 degrees Celsius. It happened to be our company's annual meeting, because the academician Zhong Nan Shan had not yet spoken of human-to-human transmission and I repeatedly decided to wear a mask.
在年会上，我全程戴着口罩没摘，中间没有吃一口饭，遇到敬酒的同事，我也会侧着身子喝。
At the annual meeting, I wear a mask throughout, the middle did not eat a mouthful of rice, meet toast colleagues, I will also sideways drink.
同事们都调侃我说：“老大，你这也太过了吧。
Colleagues joked at me: "Boss, you are too much.
”那个时候，大家心里都觉得没事。
"At that time, everyone felt fine.
我自己也想，应该不会那么“倒霉”吧，但考虑到女儿和照顾孩子的岳母的健康，我还是自行在房间里隔离了。
I thought it wouldn't be so unlucky, but considering the health of my daughter and my mother-in-law, I was isolated in my room.
吃饭他们送到门口，到点了去社区打针，然而，事情并没有往好的方向发展。
They took them to the door and to the community to get shots, but things didn't go well.
22日，爱人也开始发烧了，因为社区诊所24日春节放假，加上定点医院交叉感染风险大，我们决定到就近的一家二甲医院——湖北省荣军医院，做个全面检查。
22, love also began to have a fever, because the community clinic 24 Spring Festival holiday, coupled with the risk of cross-infection at designated hospitals, we decided to the nearest Second A hospital - Hubei Invalids Hospital - for a comprehensive check-up.
湖北省荣军医院发热门诊　受访者供图荣军医院距离我家只有1.1公里，设有定点发热门诊。
The Fever Clinic of Invalids Hospital in Hubei Province is only 1.1 kilometers away from my home and has a fixed-point fever clinic.
到了医院，看病的人排了大长队，但肯定没有定点收治医院的人多。
At the hospital, there were long queues of patients, but there was certainly no fixed-point hospital.
我和爱人一上午就排到了，抽血、做CT、等结果，很快片子出来了，结果显示：我双肺严重感染，爱人单肺感染。
My wife and I have been in the morning, blood extraction, CT, and other results, soon came out, the results showed: I have serious lung infection, the lover single lung infection.
拿着检查单，我俩蒙了。
Take the checklists. We're blindfolded.
当天，我们被认定为疑似病人收治了进去，刚开始医院比较慌乱，并没有太大心理准备，专门隔离病房也没有，后来，医院开会临时统筹将一个病区改造成了新冠肺炎隔离病房，我和爱人算是比较幸运的，是第8个和第9个收治进去的。
On the same day, we were admitted as suspected patients admitted to the hospital, just started panic, not too much psychological preparation, there is no special isolation room, the hospital meeting to temporarily co-ordinate the transformation of a sick area into the SARS isolation ward, my wife and I are more fortunate, is the eighth and ninth admission.
进来安顿好后，我第一时间发了朋友圈，告诉我身边的亲朋好友：“我可能是新冠肺炎，请大家注意，如果有感冒发热的，赶紧就诊。
After settling in, I immediately sent a circle of friends to tell my friends and relatives around me: "I may be the new crown pneumonia, please notice, if you have a cold fever, hurry to see a doctor.
”坦白讲，入院后，我的情绪波动很大，人都有面对未知的恐惧，说不怕死那是开玩笑的。
Frankly, my mood swings since admission, and people have a fear of the unknown that it's only a joke not to be afraid of death.
岳母带着女儿在家也很焦急，一直给我爱人打电话，说着说着两人就哭得泣不成声，聊的话题多半是“万一治不好了，怎么办”，“孩子成孤儿怎么办？”湖北省荣军医院办理入院窗口　受访者供图作为家里的顶梁柱，我心里特别不是滋味，我劝自己不能倒下，既然事情已经这样了，那就把自己放心地交给医生，相信医生。
My mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, anxious to stay at home with her daughter, continued to call my wife and sobbed, mostly on the topic of "What if the baby fails to heal" and "What if the baby becomes an orphan
只要我和爱人有一个能活下去，我5岁女儿就不会成为孤儿。
My 5-year-old daughter won't be an orphan if I have one to live with.
想通了以后，我还是做了最坏的打算，把家里的财产盘了盘，交代了身后事，还有，写了遗书。
After thinking of it, I made the worst of it, put my family's fortune on the table, told me what had happened, and wrote my last wishes.
事实上，当你开始平静地接受死亡，心态就会发生很大变化。
In fact, when you begin to accept death calmly, the mindset will change dramatically.
第二天，我告知岳母和亲朋，如果没有不好的消息，不要打电话，没有消息，就是最好的消息。
The next day, I told my mother-in-law and friends that if there was no bad news, do not call, no news, that is the best news.
我和爱人开始互相鼓励，专心对抗病魔。
My lover and I began to encourage each other to focus on fighting disease.
一天输液10个小时，打的多了，手上布满了针眼，有时候针走动了，整个手都是肿的。
A day infusion 10 hours, hit much, hand is full of needle eye, sometimes needle moves, whole hand is swollen.
而且当时医院还没有配饭服务，家人每天把饭菜送到医院电梯口，护士再去取。
The hospital did not have a meal service, and the family took the food to the hospital elevator every day and the nurse picked it up.
大年夜，肖心诚和爱人在医院看春节联欢晚会　受访者供图面对新的病毒，医生也是试着来的。
On New Year's Eve, Xiao Xincheng and his wife were watching the Spring Festival Gala at the hospital. The doctors tried to deal with the new virus.
入院前五天，医生按照抗菌和抗病毒的治疗方案，打了头孢等抗生素。
Five days before admission, the doctor administered antibiotics such as cefta in accordance with an antibacterial and antiviral treatment regimen.
治疗2天，我的体温从37.7℃的低烧，上升到38℃甚至接近39℃的高烧，因为之前生物学得还不错，知道一旦输液，肯定是一个免疫力被破坏的过程，所以根本没有去想：“为什么越来越厉害了。
After two days of treatment, my temperature rose from a low fever of 37.7 degrees Celsius to a high fever of 38 degrees Celsius or close to 39 degrees Celsius, because I had a good biology and knew that once infusion was a process in which immunity was destroyed, I didn't think: "Why is it getting worse?
”在武汉市第三医院光谷院区，驰援武汉的上海第四人民医院医生正在帮爱人詹新做检查　受访者供图住院第5天，核酸检测结果才出来，我俩被确诊为新冠肺炎，我是弱阳性，爱人是阳性。
"In the Guanggu courtyard of Wuhan's Third Hospital, doctors at the Fourth People's Hospital in Wuhan are helping lovers Zhan Xin make an examination for five days before the nucleic acid test results come out.
由于荣军医院的医疗条件有限，爱人被转到了武汉第三医院光谷院区（以下简称：武汉三院光谷院区），我心情一下子跌到了谷底。
Due to the limited medical conditions of the Invalids Hospital, the lover was transferred to the Guanggu courtyard area of Wuhan Third Hospital (hereinafter referred to as the Guanggu courtyard district of Wuhan Three Hospitals).
虽然我不让家人和她联系，但我每天都发微信给她，说的都是鼓励的话。
Although I wouldn't let my family get in touch with her, I wrote to her every day, saying encouraging words.
爱人告诉我，武汉三院光谷院区的治疗方案不同，没有打针，就是吃药。
Love told me, Wuhan three hospitals Guanggu courtyard treatment plan is different, there is no injection, is to take medicine.
医生叮嘱吃盐酸阿维多尔片和连花清瘟胶囊，然后多吃饭，增加营养。
Doctors ordered to take Avidor hydrochloride tablets and Lianhua Qing capsule, then eat more food, increase nutrition.
幸运的是，从第五天开始，我开始退烧了，每天用毛巾擦出很多汗。
Luckily, from day five, I began to get rid of my fever and use a towel to wipe out a lot of sweat every day.
爱人给我发来微信说：“你一定要先治愈，我才有希望。
"Love sent me a message saying:" You must first cure, I hope.
”吃饭问题医院也解决了，为了避免交叉感染，护士每天一天三顿送饭，菜谱也很丰富，每天至少两个鸡蛋，半只鸡，有鱼肉、青菜等等。
To avoid cross-infection, nurses deliver meals three times a day and have a rich menu of at least two eggs a day, half a chicken, fish, vegetables and so on.
医生再三叮嘱说，就算再没胃口，也要多吃蛋白质，提高免疫力。
Doctors repeatedly ordered to eat more protein, even if there is no appetite, to improve immunity.
话是这么说，但任谁遇到这种事，保持好心态都太难了。
That said, it's hard to stay in a good frame of mind for anyone in this situation.
爱人转院后，旁边病床上转来一个50多岁的大叔，是在家庭聚餐时感染的，现在一家8口人全部住进医院了。
After the transfer, a 50-year-old uncle was transferred from a nearby hospital bed. He contracted the infection during a family dinner. Now all eight members of the family are hospitalized.
大叔很忧心，一天要量无数次体温，总担心自己的身体。
Uncle is very worried, a day to take countless temperature, always worried about their own body.
“体温怎么上来了，又到38℃了”“为什么又给我上呼吸机了，我病情重了吗？”“我没病，为什么要打那么多吊瓶啊？”武汉市第三医院光谷院区隔离病房　受访者供图我算是个“过来者”，知道退烧肯定有个反复的过程，大叔年龄大点负面情绪多，也很正常，我就试着帮他排解。
Why am I on the ventilator again, am I seriously ill? I am not ill, why do I have to hit so many bottles? I am a comer in the Guanggu courtyard of Wuhan Third Hospital.
从1月22日住进来，医护人员的辛苦我是感受最深的。
From January 22 to live in, I feel the pain of medical staff is the most deeply.
因为病人多，床头的呼叫铃一天都没停过，此起彼伏。
Because of the number of patients, the head of the bed call bell did not stop day after day, one after another.
全院的医生、护士十几天没回家了，每天抢救病人、输液都用跑的，跟“打仗”没什么区别。
The whole hospital doctors, nurses did not return home for ten days, every day to save patients, infusion are used to run, and "war" is no different.
主管我们床位的护士说，她一个防护服穿了六天，晚上戴口罩睡觉，为的就是能不浪费物资就不浪费。
The nurse in charge of our bed said she wore a protective suit for six days and slept with a mask at night so she wouldn't waste anything.
有一次，她扎针扎错了，紧张得不得了，还连忙道歉，我就特别体谅她。
Once, when she pricked the wrong needle and was so nervous that she apologized, I was very considerate of her.
作为患者，应该理解配合医护人员，不要再增加他们的负担，能自己解决的自己解决。
As patients, should understand to cooperate with medical personnel, do not increase their burden, can solve their own solution.
其实，他们和患者一样，都面临着巨大的心理压力。
In fact, they, like the patients, are facing tremendous psychological pressure.
这次，全国派了许多医疗队驰援武汉，我爱人住的武汉三院光谷院区，就有上海市第四人民医院、上海同济大学附属康复医院、同济大学附属东方医院的医生。
This time, many medical teams from all over the country were sent to Wuhan, and the Guanggu courtyard area where my wife lives includes doctors from the Fourth People's Hospital in Shanghai, the Rehabilitation Hospital affiliated with Tongji University and the Oriental Hospital affiliated with Tongji University.
在他们的精心照顾下，1月30日，爱人已经退烧。
Under their careful care, on January 30, the lover has gone down with fever.
詹新与同济大学附属康复医院的医生合影　受访者供图2月1日，入院第9天，我的体温已经70多个小时保持正常，气色恢复得也很好，起床从开始的撑着起来，到现在很自然地坐起来。
Photo by Dr. Janneh Tongji University Rehabilitation Hospital. On February 1, I had a normal temperature of over 70 hours and recovered well. I got up from the start and sat up quite naturally.
医生说，再观察几天，如果没什么异常，说不定就可以出院了。
The doctor said that after a few more days of observation, if nothing unusual, he might be discharged.
我很开心，听着外面的鸟叫声，心里的阴霾一下子吹散了。
I am very happy, listening to the birds outside, the heart of the haze suddenly blew away.
最后三天，我每天按时抽血，照CT，等结果，乖乖吃饭。
The last three days, I take blood every day, according to CT, wait for the results, obediently eat.
2月3日上午11点，医生正式宣布我康复出院。
At 11 a.m. on February 3, the doctor officially announced that I had recovered from hospital.
我第一时间发了朋友圈，大家都很振奋。
I made friends for the first time and everyone was excited.
我又把这个消息报备给社区和物业，值班司机说不敢来接，我表示理解，因为在社区管辖的几十栋楼里，有四十多例确认和疑似病例，其中有2名物业也感染了。
I sent this message back to the community and the property, and the driver on duty said he was afraid to come and pick it up. I understand that there were more than 40 confirmed and suspected cases in dozens of buildings under community jurisdiction, two of which were also infected.
下午办理完出院手续，叮嘱我好好休息，最后是我自己走回了家。
Afternoon to complete the discharge formalities, tell me to take a good rest, and finally I walked home.
那天，我走在武汉的街头，阳光格外地好。
That day, I walked on the streets of Wuhan, the sun is exceptionally good.
即将出院康复的肖心诚发布的朋友圈2月8日，元宵节，爱人也出院了，武汉三院光谷院区还搞了一个欢送仪式，新闻图片上穿黑色羽绒服的就是我爱人，和爱人同批次出院的还有另外6名新冠肺炎患者。
Xiao Xincheng, who is due to be released from hospital on Feb. 8, was released from the Lantern Festival, and the Guangya Campus of Wuhan Three Hospitals held a farewell ceremony featuring my wife wearing a black down jacket.
出院当天，主管床位的同济大学附属康复医院主管护师沈艳梅写下了这段话：“今天我们病区有3位病人治愈，包括我负责的39床詹妹妹，这是我来武汉后，治愈的第一批病人，十多天的辛苦终于有了回报。
On the day of discharge, Shen Yanmei, the superintendent of the hospital attached to Tongji University, wrote: "Today, three patients in our ward were cured, including sister Zhan, whom I was responsible for.
”詹新与同济大学附属康复医院主管护师沈艳梅合影　受访者供图武汉市第三医院光谷院区举行了首批治愈患者欢送仪式 詹新（左七）　受访者供图在医院待了整整12天，我们特别感谢医生、护士，也特别感谢社区和物业，相比较那些仍在隔离的重症患者，我和爱人是幸运儿。
Zhan and Shen Yanmei, director of rehabilitation hospital attached to Tongji University, were the first group of patients to be sent to Guanggu courtyard area of Tu Wu Han Hospital.
更加幸运的是，我的女儿和岳母隔离了17天，目前健健康康；我的同事和朋友居家隔离观察，也都健健康康。
Fortunately, my daughter and mother-in-law were separated for 17 days and are now in good health; my colleagues and friends were kept in quarantine and in good health.
我平时不爱发朋友圈，也从不爱拿自己的故事来讲，这次之所以愿意分享，是想告诉那些正处在“黑暗”中的朋友们，不要只看到悲伤，不要只往坏处想，把自己放心地交给医生，打倒病魔，指日可待。
I usually do not like to have friends, and never love to tell their own story, this time I would like to share with those who are in the "dark," not only to see sorrow, not to think of the bad, to give their own trust to the doctor, to defeat the illness, in a matter of days.
回到熟悉的小家，我和家人团聚了。
Back at my familiar home, I was reunited with my family.
接下来居家隔离的14天，我给自己和爱人布置了一份特殊的功课：每天房间内步行5000步以上，练拳10分钟，每天鸡蛋三枚，蔬菜若干，时刻戴口罩。
For the next 14 days of isolation, I gave myself and my partner a special assignment: Walk more than 5,000 steps a day, do 10 minutes of boxing, three eggs a day, some vegetables, and always wear a mask.
入院12天，我发现客厅桌上的两条金鱼一直没喂食，依然生龙活虎。
After 12 days in hospital, I found two goldfish on the living room table that were still alive and well.
生命顽强，人一定比鱼更顽强。
Life is tenacious, man must be more tenacious than fish.
肖心诚出院后在朋友圈晒图配文：人一定比鱼顽强　受访者供图文中肖心诚、詹新均为化名征集令《新民周刊》现面向全国征集新冠肺炎采访对象和真实故事：如果你是参与抗击新冠肺炎疫情的医护人员或其家属，我们希望聆听你的“战疫”故事，也希望传达你的诉求。
