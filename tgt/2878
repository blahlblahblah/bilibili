对疫情的结构性反思，是我们送给每个人的武器。
Structural reflection on the epidemic is the weapon we give to everyone.

不知道你还是否记得，在疫情初期，在各种碎片化新闻和公众号推文的轰炸中，一篇三万字的长文在信息海中短暂地激起了一丝水花。
I wonder if you remember that in the early days of the epidemic, amid all the fragmentation of news and the bombing of public tweets, a long, 30,000-word essay briefly stirred a glimmer of water in the sea of information.
文章写的是针对本次疫情的结构性反思，相比于长度，内容带来的阅读挑战显然更大。
The article is about the structural reflection of the epidemic, and the challenges of reading content are clearly greater than the length of the epidemic.
全篇基本由学术性的语言构建而成，谈及官僚制度、意识形态、谣言与言论自由…… 不同的切入点清晰地指向因这场疫情而暴露出的各个环节的问题。
The entire article is basically an academic language, talking about bureaucracy, ideology, rumors and freedom of speech... different entry points point clearly to the problems exposed by the epidemic.
毫不意外的是，文章很快消失，然后又有若干复刻版冒出来。
Not surprisingly, the article soon disappeared, and then several more copies appeared.
吸引互联网传阅的还有一个原因：人们发现这篇严肃长文竟出自三位00后的学生之手，而他们所在的 Philosophia 哲学社,是一个由中学生主导的青年哲学社团。
Another reason for the popularity of the Internet is that it has been found that this long, serious essay was written by three hundred students from the Philosophia Philosophy Society, a youth philosophy society dominated by high school students.
年轻人怎么看待这场疫情，他们又在这场灾难中扮演着什么角色？这个问题的答案不仅作用于当下，还关乎着将来。
The answer to the question of what young people think of the epidemic and what role they play in it is not just for the present, but for the future.
我们找到了这篇文章的作者之一Zehao，跟他聊了聊文章和写作背后的事情，以下自述根据采访整理而成。
We found Zehao, one of the authors of the article, and we talked to him about the story behind the article and the writing.
文章节选，阅读全文请通过Philosophia哲学社公众号获取相关信息“BIE别的”读者们好。
Excerpt from the article. Read the full text. Good news for readers of "BIE Other" via the Philosophia Philosophy Society Public Number.
我是 Zehao，目前本科一年级在读，专业还没定，但是我想我会选 Global Cultural Studies 和哲学作为以后的主攻方向。
I'm Zehao. I'm a freshman and I haven't decided on my major yet, but I think I'll take Global Cultural Studies and Philosophy as the main thrust.
今年学校开学比较早，我 1 月初就离开国内了，所以这场疫情我算是在稍远的地方经历着。
School started early this year, and I left the country in early January, so I've been there for a while.
大概是从 1 月 18 号左右，我开始注意到情况有些不对。
Around January 18, I began to notice something was amiss.
所以那几天给我妈发了一堆消息，让她赶紧去囤口罩买吃的，这几天千万哪都别去。
So a few days to my mother sent a pile of news, let her hurriedly to buy a mask to buy food, these days 10 million do not go anywhere.
因为我之前很少主动给我妈发那么多东西，所以她挺重视的，我们家物资就备得很充足，本来想回老家的计划也取消了。
Because I seldom offered to give my mother so many things, so she took it seriously, our family supplies are well prepared, the original plan to go back home was cancelled.
我妈和许多人一样，也差不多是从 1 月 22 号、 23 号才意识到情况有多严重。
My mother, like many people, realized just how serious the situation was on January 22nd and 23rd.
因为一开始数字确实不那么吓人，所以感觉也没什么，只是本能地想提醒家里人多注意。
Because the numbers were not so scary at first, they didn't feel bad. They just instinctively wanted to remind their families to pay more attention.
之后确诊和疑似病例开始攀升的时候，我就比较担心了，而且当时感觉自己好像能做的很少就有些焦虑。
When the diagnosis and suspected cases began to rise, I became more worried, and I felt a little anxious about how little I seemed to be able to do.
之后看到我朋友圈有几个同学组建了一个「武汉加油 | 北美留学生」的志愿小组，最多的时候有两千人，我当时也加入了，想负责写文案。
Then I saw a group of some of my friends form a volunteer group called "Wuhan refueling and # 124; North American students," with a maximum of 2,000 students. I joined them and wanted to be responsible for writing the paperwork.
但他们那个文案特别民族主义，我写着恶心，很快就退出了。
But their text was particularly nationalistic, and I wrote disgust and quickly dropped out.
但我又必须得做点什么，所以在 Philosophia 哲学社的公众号上发了一篇援助武汉的捐赠途径汇总。
But I had to do something about it, so I posted a summary of donations to Wuhan on the Philosophia Philosophy Society's public number.
在做信息汇总的同时，我也意识到了官方在这次疫情里面扮演了一个多差劲的角色，你看看微博还以为我国是由社会互助组织组建的无政府乌托邦。
While compiling the information, I also realized how bad the official role played by the epidemic, you see micro-blogging as an anarchic utopia organized by social solidarity groups.
结合种种原因，我觉得当下我们需要写一篇有关本次疫情的反思文章。
For a variety of reasons, I think we need to write a reflection on the current epidemic.
相比于原创的新闻报道和针对某种具体现象的批判文章（比如要消灭病毒，不要消灭生病的人），我们想讨论的是这些现象之所以出现的成因，其实是一个症结-症状的关系，我们希望更多的人能了解前者。
In contrast to original news reports and critical articles on specific phenomena (such as the elimination of viruses, not the elimination of sick people), we want to discuss the causes of these phenomena, which are actually a knot-symptom relationship, and we hope that more people will understand the former.
我一开始只找了一位在巴黎上学的朋友 Yanagishita 合写，因为对方是学政治的，可以就官僚和科层制做一些具体论述。
I started with only one friend, Yanagishita, who was a student in Paris, because he was a political learner and could elaborate on the bureaucracy and hierarchy.
后来觉得这篇文章的体量可能两个人应付不过来，就又找了一位人在国内，关系比较好的学马克思的同学米泽，主要写意识形态方面的内容。
Later I felt that the size of this article may not be able to cope with two people, and then found a person in the country, a better relationship with the students of Marx Mize, mainly written ideological content.
我负责谣言部分和全篇的整合。
I'm in charge of the rumor section and the whole story.
讨论主要在微信群里进行，反正大家都不怎么睡觉，时差也不是太大的问题。
The discussion took place mainly in the micro-mail group, since not everyone slept much anyway, and jet lag was not a big problem.
Zehao询问朋友Yanagishita的写作意向因为每天看新闻和社交媒体，我们总能获得新的反面案例，所以基本是一边写一边往里面加东西。
Zehao asks his friend Yanagishita about his writing intentions. Because we always get new negative stories from reading the news and social media every day, we basically add something to it as we write.
大概美东时间 2 月 1 号，我们完成了全篇的写作，之后就是排版和发布的事情了。
Probably February 1, the United States time, we have completed the entire writing, followed by the typesetting and publishing.
公众号没法看原文，而且篇幅又巨长，我当时预计阅读量应该在 5 万左右。
The public numbers were not readable, and they were so long that I would have expected them to read in the order of 50,000.
结果没想到只我们后台就统计到了 30 万，实际应该更多。
The result did not expect that we only backstage statistics of 300,000, in fact should be more.
反馈的话，大部分还是正面的评价，被（基本上是）全网夸确实很爽，但我们其实并不希望大家往我们身上聚集太多注意力。
Most of the feedback was positive, and it was (basically) a lot of good news, but we didn't really want people to focus too much attention on us.
因为这篇文章本身没有多大的理论价值（它也不是篇学术文章），我们只不过是在运用很多前人总结出来的理论框架，以及我们从中新阐发的一些视角对本次事件进行思考，更多其实是回应性的，所以我们不会把自己这个工作的价值捧得多高。
Since the article itself has little theoretical value (and is not an academic article), we are simply using many theoretical frameworks developed by our predecessors, and we are thinking about this event from a new perspective.
文章已经被404 了，但它却活在了大 V 的截图里，虽然 Zehao 并不喜欢奇葩说而且之所以能写出这篇文章，和我们所拥有的 privilege （特权）关系非常大。
The article has been 404, but it lives in the screenshot of the Big V, although Zehao doesn't like the wonderful flowers and the reason we have this article is very much related to the privilege we have.
我从小是在北京海淀区上的学，网络上不是有好多关于 “海淀黄庄” 的自媒体文章吗，基本上描述的就是我的生活。
I was a child in Beijing Haidian District of the school, the network is not a lot of "Haidian Huangzhuang" from the media articles, basically described my life.
特别可怕，一堆课外班，整个区的孩子从小往死里学。
Especially terrible, a lot of extracurricular classes, the whole area of children from childhood to death.
而且当时我数学不好，我真的学不会奥数，但是学校又都特别看重这个，所以升学就遇到了些困难。
And then I was not good at math, I really can't learn the Olympic number, but the school also value this very much, so the promotion encountered some difficulties.
后来因为我有出国的意愿，又考虑到户口原因没法在北京高考，所以经过了一系列面试和中考后，我申请去了北师大实验中学的国际部。
After a series of interviews and a mid-term examination, I applied to the international department of the Beijing Normal University Experimental Middle School.
正是在国际部这种相对轻松的学习环境下，我有更多的机会去学我喜欢的东西，比如花大量的时间去看有关哲学的书，哲学社也是在那个时候从学长那里接手的。
It was in the relatively relaxed learning environment of the International Department that I had more opportunities to learn what I liked, such as spending a great deal of time reading books on philosophy, which was also taken over by the Philosophy Society at that time.
而且当时我通过读书感到很震撼的一点是，在人类发展的某个阶段，哲学是一门可以给科学奠基的学科（！），我当时正好数学和物理学的不太成，所以就觉得还不如直接去学这个 NB 的。
And one thing that struck me through reading at the time was that at some stage of human development, philosophy was a science-laying discipline, and I was just not very good at math and physics, so I thought it might be better to go straight to the NB.
可如果要参加高考的话，我不可能有这种自由。
But if I had to take the college entrance examination, I wouldn't have the freedom.
公众号的整体视觉识别系统也是Zehao做的，其实高一的时候他更感兴趣的是平面设计所以一直以来，我都觉得自己只不过是一个体系下的幸运儿罢了。
Zehao did the overall public image recognition system, but he was more interested in graphic design when he was a sophomore so I've always thought I was just a lucky guy in a system.
我所享受到的优越条件和我这辈子所做的任何事情都没有关系，只是因为出生在了较为优渥的家庭里而已。
The advantages I enjoy have nothing to do with anything I've ever done in my life, just because I was born into a better family.
所以我理应用自己的这种优越条件所产生的成果回馈社会、乃至带动大家一起改变。
So I use my advantage of the results of the social feedback, or even to bring about changes together.
如果我们这些所谓的“精英”都没有社会责任感，享受着全国乃至全世界最好的教育资源，但每天仅仅是想着怎么赚钱的话，那只能说是一种耻辱。
If we, the so-called "elite," do not have a sense of social responsibility and enjoy the best educational resources in the country and the world, it would be a shame to think only about how to make money every day.
这也就是为什么我们文章的名字不叫对新冠疫情的结构性批判，而叫结构性反思，也就是为什么我们用了这么长的篇幅去处理可能的反驳：因为这篇文章是写给每一个人看的，是希望每一个人都能在阅读这篇文章后学到一些他们可以为自身所用、保护自己应有权益的分析方式，是相当于在分享给所有人可以用来批判的武器。
That is why the name of our article is not a structural critique of the new crown epidemic, but rather a structural rebuttal, which is why we spend so much time dealing with possible rebuttals: because this article is for everyone to read, hoping that everyone will learn something they can use to protect their rights and interests, a weapon that can be shared with everyone for criticism.
其实说到这个我挺开心的，因为我在高三的时候就已经写过了一篇关于谣言和辟谣的文章，这次疫情爆发之后很多民众的声音正好验证了我之前的理论，能看到有越来越多人在慢慢开始反思了。
In fact, I am very happy about this, because I have written a third year of rumors and rumors, after the outbreak of many people's voices just verified my previous theory, can see that more and more people are slowly starting to reflect.
并且最近大家也在开始抵制「带节奏」「夹私货」这种表述了，是一件令人高兴的事。
And recently people are beginning to resist the expression "private goods with rhythm," which is a happy thing.
看到新闻 - 等待辟谣- 再被反转，似乎成了疫情期间大家新养成的一种阅读习惯因为疫情的原因，我最近在朋友圈或者其他平台上表达的比较多，但日常生活中我是比较偏向沉默的那一类。
Seeing the news - waiting for rumors - being reversed seems to have become a new habit of reading during the epidemic. Because of the epidemic, I have recently expressed more on friends and other platforms, but in my daily life I prefer the silent type.
每天的生活基本上就是写作业、看书、微信聊天、吃饭睡觉。
Everyday life basically is to write homework, read a book, micro-letter chat, eat and sleep.
平常听音乐挺多的，主要是写作业的时候当个调剂。
Usually listen to a lot of music, mainly when writing homework when a tune.
一般会听古典乐或者电影配乐，但我是先听配乐，觉得不错的再去找电影看。
Usually listen to classical music or film music, but I listen to music first, feel good again to find the film.
后来听说《三体》要拍电影了，我还用自己听过的歌，对应书中的情节列了一个《三体》电影配乐歌单出来。
Later I heard that "Three Bodies" was going to be a movie, and I also used my own songs, corresponding to the plot of a "Three Body" movie album.
可是电影一直鸽到现在，也不知道什么时候能上映。
But the movie pigeon until now, also do not know when can be shown.
不写作业的时候我说话也不多，因为社恐，不太敢跟不认识的人直接交流，而且也不敢自己打车坐飞机。
When I don't do my homework, I don't talk much, because I'm afraid that I won't be able to communicate directly with people I don't know, and I won't take a taxi by myself.
如果没有同学一起，我连校门都不太会出。
I wouldn't even be able to get out of school without my classmates.
有的时候看其他人出去旅游其实我也想去，可现在还是会害怕，但是没事，估计再过一年我就敢了哈哈。
Sometimes watching others go out to travel actually I also want to go, but now still will be afraid, but nothing, I guess another year I dare Haha.
所以上 B 站追番算是我平常的娱乐方式之一，最近在看《某科学的超电磁炮》和《魔法少女小圆外传》。
So it's one of my usual forms of entertainment to go to B-station, recently watching "A Scientific Super Electromagnet Gun" and "The Magic Girl's Xiao Yuan."
小圆里面有个角色我一直挺喜欢的，叫晓美焰。
There's a part in Xiao Yuan I always liked. It's xiao mei yin.
我很喜欢她的性格，就极其勇敢、坚毅、果断，但又非常温柔。
I liked her very much and was extremely brave, resolute, decisive, but very gentle.
说实话这姑娘真的惨，为了主角小圆，心甘情愿轮回了上百遍，每次两个人都要重新认识一遍。
To tell the truth, the girl really sad, for the protagonist Xiao Yuan, willing to reincarnate a hundred times, each time two people want to know again.
很苦，但我就是挺崇拜这样的人的。
It's hard, but I just adore people like that.
晓美焰，图源《魔法少女小圆》前段时间有个话题非常火，叫政治抑郁，我自己其实非常能理解这种情况的出现：因为感觉自己无法影响宏观的政策决定过程、又感到世态炎凉，所以才会感到政治抑郁（或者诸如此类的情感）。
/ [^ # 39 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105] / n. I can understand very well that political depression (or something like that) comes about because I feel unable to influence the macro-policy decision-making process and feel cold in the world.
我自己也有难过的时候，比如听到李文亮医生去世的消息时，我正好在课堂上，差点哭出来。
I was sad myself, for example, when I heard the news of Dr. Li Wenliang's death, I happened to be in class and almost cried.
因为长时间沉浸在有关于疫情的报道中，有一部分人出现了心理甚至是生理上的不适，都可以归结为 政治抑郁 或 替代性创伤 带来的影响但我想说的是，大家不要放任自己陷入这种状态中，因为我们要意识到：社会的当下状态不是「自然」的、无法改变的客体，而是人类实践的结果，所以我们一定要参与到实践中去。
Because there have been reports of outbreaks for a long time, some people have psychological and even physical problems that can be attributed to the effects of political depression or substitution trauma. But I would like to say that we should not allow ourselves to fall into this state because the present state of society is not a "natural" and unchangeable object, but the result of human practice.
这种实践不一定非要是那种浪漫化的一蹴而就：我今天劝说了一个人，让 ta 动摇了一下开始思考，就完全可以是一种实践；我今天写了一篇文章，同样是一种实践：关键是在于你有没有认识到自己的力量、认识到世界是可以被改变的。
This practice does not have to be a romantic one: I persuaded a person today to let ta waver and start thinking, and it can be a practice; I wrote an article today, the same practice: the key is whether you recognize your strengths and realize that the world can be changed.
比如疫情期间，我有很多和我同龄的朋友去当志愿者，去组织志愿活动，捐了几十万、几百万的钱和物资给疫区，我觉得就是很好的对抗「无力」的方法。
During the epidemic, for example, I had a lot of friends my age who volunteered to organize volunteer activities and donated hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars and materials to affected areas.
我承认有非常多还没有完成、我们应当去做的东西，但这不是绝望的理由。
I admit that there is so much unfinished business that we should do, but it is not a reason for despair.
就像你之前问我，这场疫情有没有带给我内心层面上的一些波动，我可能确实会觉得我更坚定了。
As you have asked me before, if this outbreak has brought me any internal fluctuations, I may indeed feel more determined.
我们所表达的东西有时会被打压或扭曲，很多人因为我的政治观点和我疏远或干脆直接骂我，但是对我来说，诚实地表达我的想法、鼓励大家去反思质疑，不是一件可做可不做的事情，是我作为一个人文学科的学者对公众应尽的责任。
What we say is sometimes suppressed or distorted, and many people scold me for my political opinions, but it is not an optional thing for me to be honest in expressing my ideas and encouraging people to reflect on it. It is my duty as a humanist scholar to the public.
这篇长文发表之后，公众号还有后续产出的文章，社团定期的运营也要继续下去。
After this long article is published, the public has follow-up articles, and the regular operation of the community will continue.
总之要做的事情还有很多，希望大家都能平安健康度过这场灾难，早日找到属于自己的“武器”。
In short, there are many things to do, hope that we can all safely and healthily through this disaster, as soon as possible to find their own "weapons.
