作者 | 苏琦编辑 | 魏佳疫情之下，消费行业遭受重击。
AT & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
餐饮、旅游、零售、影院等线下业态首当其冲受到影响，众多企业因身陷“现金流”问题不得不做出裁员举动，但另一方面，生鲜电商、到家服务、无人零售货柜等新消费领域也出现逆势增长，迎来新机会。
Catering, tourism, retail, cinemas and other offline industries were the first to be affected, with many companies having to make layoffs due to cash flow problems. On the other hand, new consumer sectors such as fresh electricity, home services and unsold containers also experienced a counter-trend growth, opening up new opportunities.
越是在重大危机的当口，越要危中寻机。
The more in a major crisis, the more crisis to find opportunities.

The projections for the next three years are based on a projection of the availability of funding, which we started preparing at the end of last year in the amount of 40-50 million RMB.
因为我们线下活动的边际成本很低，所以我们的活动规模化以后，整个利润水平比现在高很多，所以我们现在要追求更用最短的时间做到规模化。
Because the marginal cost of our offline activities is very low, the overall profit level is much higher than it is now when we scale our activities, so we are now aiming to achieve scale in the shortest possible time.
到2019年为止，我们都还是一直在做活动，今年开始我们会开拓C端产品的研发，未来C端产品贡献的利润会是很大的一个变量。

For SaaS and privatisation, we will focus on different industries in different economic circumstances.
2019年来讲比较偏金融业，2018年是教育，2017年是互金，最早的时候是互联网公司，所以我们对应的行业相对来讲没有太集中。
With 2019 for the financial sector, 2018 for education, 2017 for mutual funds, and the earliest for Internet companies, our industries are relatively unfocused.
我们最近也在产品上做一些场景化，降低门槛。
We have also recently done some scene on the product, lowering the threshold.
但通用也有好处，就是像最近疫情期间，有一些行业的客户依旧在增长，比如游戏、医药等。
But GM also has the advantage of having a number of industries where customers are still growing, such as games, pharmaceuticals, and so on, as in the recent epidemic.
因为中台不是标准化产品，而且数据产品本身落地也需要数据，所以要先有业务状态才能运转。
Because the console is not a standardised product, and the data product itself needs data to land, it needs to be in business mode before it can run.
我们一般会在年底会谈第2年的预算，一年大概会分3-4期项目，一个季度为一期，基本上是这样一个节奏。
We usually meet at the end of the year to talk about the second year's budget. There are about three or four phases in a year.

— 评委问答—天图投资合伙人魏国兴：疫情期间，味BACK的销售情况如何？味BACK创始人王致祥：我们销售市场反而是增长的，疫情导致我们2月份的销量是去年的两倍，但是货卖出去却发不出去，整个物流链和中间的分发链还存在一定问题。
2007-9-19 19: 19 [hide] Judge Wei Guoxing, Partner of Tian Gu, how is the sales of VACK going on during the epidemic? Wang Zhixiang: Our sales market has actually increased and the epidemic has caused us to sell twice as much in February as last year.
有很多顾客因为收不到货导致退货，我们现在在酌情减少新的活动排期，因为马上就要到三八大促了，我们会比较担忧发货的问题。
We are now in the process of reducing the schedule of new activities as we are approaching the thirty-eighth promotion and we will be more worried about delivery.
清流资本合伙人刘博：能不能具体说下现在渠道的情况，以及毛利润的情况？味BACK创始人王致祥：我们现在有80%是直接零售，to C端，20%以批发分销的方式进行。
Liu Bo: Can you specify the current channel situation and gross profit? Wang Zhixiang, founder of VACK: We now have 80% direct retail, to C end and 20% wholesale distribution.
这其中80%全部来自于线上，20%是线下。
Of these, 80 per cent are online and 20 per cent are offline.
我们自营的毛利相对比较高，产品毛利有65%，到线下分销的毛利相对较低，在50%左右。
Our self-employed gross profit is relatively high, at 65 per cent for products and relatively low at around 50 per cent for offline distribution.
不惑创投创始合伙人李祝捷：那么多零食可以做，为什么选鱼皮这个品类？味BACK创始人王致祥：鱼皮这个品类是因为在我们做的深度调研结果里，膨化零食的出货数量是最高的，仅次于糖果，糖果本身是一个下行市场，我们对膨化这样一个微增长的市场非常看好。
Not Confused Founding Partner Li Zhu Jie: So many snacks can be done, why choose the fish skin category? The fish skin category is because we did in-depth research results, expansion snacks are the highest number of shipments, after candy itself is a downward market, we are very optimistic about such a small growth market.
基于这个选择，膨化食品的升级有两个方向，一个是工艺升级，用低温油炸或者是冻干工艺去替代原本的高温油炸工艺。
Based on this option, the upgrade of expanded food has two directions, one is process upgrading, using low-temperature frying or freeze-drying process to replace the original high-temperature frying process.
另外一方面是原材料的升级，用山药、玉米、甘薯这些原材料去替代原本的米果。
On the other hand is the upgrading of raw materials, with yam, corn, sweet potato raw materials to replace the original rice fruit.
经过测试，无论工艺怎么升级，都没有办法保留膨化食品酥脆的口感，至于原材料，很多商家也在做山药片，但这些都没有办法解决消费者心智认知当中的健康食品的概念。
After testing, no matter how the process is upgraded, there is no way to preserve the crisp texture of the expanded food. As for raw materials, many retailers are making yam pills, but none of these can solve the concept of healthy food in consumers' mental perception.
我们想到了蛋白质，2018年鱼皮在新加坡当地已经比较火了，陆续传到国内市场，而新加坡鱼皮的工厂就在广东东莞，实际上是中国本土的产品，我们就开始关注这一赛道。
We think of the protein. In 2018, fish skins became more popular locally in Singapore and spread to the domestic market, while the Singapore Fish Skin factory is located in Dongguan, Guangdong Province, which is actually a domestic product.
广东和香港地区的消费者也成了我们特定的种子用户。
Consumers in Guangdong and Hong Kong have also become our specific seed users.

— 评委问答—中网投投研部总经理汪存富：维妥的盈利模式是什么？在全网公开去抓数据，这种数据获取的渠道会不会有一些隐私或者其他方面的问题？维妥科技创始人兼CEO朱起：我们是一个数据平台，主要以数据展示为主，但同时我们有一个招商协作工具，这个会偏SaaS，但是这两块都暂时是不收费的，付费的部分主要是在品播汇的解决方案和未来S2B中进行盈利。
What is Vito's profit model? Is there any privacy or other issues with public access to data across the Web? We are a data platform, mainly based on data presentation, but we have a tool for investment promotion, which is SaaS, but both are free for the time being, mainly for the benefit of the solution and future S2B.
我们现在公开采集的二十几万个直播间，全都采集的都是公开的数据，不是破解或者说是以任何非法渠道拿到的，也没有获取任何的个人隐私数据。
The more than two hundred thousand studios we now openly collect are all publicly available data, not cracked or obtained through any illegal channels, and have no access to personal privacy data.
华创资本合伙人王道平：你们主要的对手有哪些？收入情况怎么样？维妥科技创始人兼CEO朱起：我们在各个模块上都有相对比较细分的竞争对手，但整体的商业模式不同，比如说在直播源数据这一块，我们2018年入行的时候也有个别几家数据公司。
Huacheng Capital Partner Wang: What are your main competitors? What are your revenues? We have relatively broken down competitors on every module, but the overall business model is different, for example, in the live source data section, and we started out with a few data companies in 2018.
像品播汇这类做品牌店铺解决方案的也有竞对，但跟我们的方式不同，我们更多的是提供一个数据驱动的解决方案：通过结合我们的数据，做一套品牌投放咨询与店铺的代运营，数据也为我们的这一块业务提供了壁垒。
Brand-store solutions like TVB also compete, but unlike our approach, we offer a more data-driven solution: by combining our data to do a brand-launch consultancy and store substitution, the data also provide a bulwark to our business.
跟我们整体商业模式完全一样的竞品是不存在的，例如我们某一大型品牌客户，通过我们的品牌直播解决方案，他们的整个投入产出比达到了1:40。
There is no competition like our overall business model. For example, one of our major branded customers, through our live branding solution, has an overall input-output ratio of 1: 40.
去年10月到12月份，我们每个月有近百万的收入，主要是品播汇的服务费。
From October to December last year, we made nearly a million dollars a month in revenue, mainly in the form of fees for goods and services.

— 评委问答—天图投资合伙人魏国兴：现在线下渠道的供货是直接买断还是预付批发？凡米粒创始人兼CEO王国毓：我们的渠道线上是天猫自营，线下分为两部分，一个算是自营合作，跟渠道直接供货，比如说玩具反斗城等，占15%左右。
2007-9-19 19: 20 [hide] Judge: Is the supply from the offline channel now a direct purchase or a prepaid wholesale? Yun: Our channel line is self-employed cat, divided into two parts, one is self-employed cooperation, with direct supply channels, such as toys counter-bucket city, accounting for about 15%.
另外一种方式是通过大概30个区域的经销商，每个区域有1-2家母婴店，是当地的渠道。
Another way is through dealers in about 30 regions, with one or two mother-and-child shops in each region, acting as a local channel.
直营连锁渠道有一定的账期，当然他们也会有一部分预付款，其他的大部分都是以现金模式直接买断。
Direct chain channels have a certain period of account, of course, they will also have a portion of the advance, most of the other is a direct cash mode of buyout.
现在目前代销的只有玩具返斗城这一家，占比在5%以内。
At present, only toys sold on behalf of this city, accounting for less than 5%.
所有的经销我们不走批发渠道，这些经销商实际上也是供给线下的下沉连锁。
We do not take all the distribution channels, these dealers are in fact the supply line of the sinking chain.
天图投资合伙人魏国兴：现在的动销情况如何？现在的销售收入构成中，大IP和自有IP的比例如何？凡米粒创始人兼CEO王国毓：我们目前的动销，在同品类当中应该是TOP3的品牌，箱包、水杯、水壶都可以进入TOP3。
Today, what is the ratio of large IP to proprietary IP in the current composition of sales revenue Yun: Our current sales should be a TOP 3 brand in the same category, bags, water cups, kettles can all enter the TOP 3.
创业初期，80%是大IP产品，到了2019年，92%是自有IP产品销售。
Initially, 80 per cent were large IP products, and by 2019, 92 per cent were home-grown IP product sales.
我们2020年会加大IP的不一样的玩法。
We're going to have a different IP game in 2020.
目前来说，我们跟工厂能实现早期备料，7-14天的生产周期，各渠道和各终端的经销订货都是按月做计划。
At present, we and the factory can achieve the early preparation, 7-14 days of production cycle, channels and terminals distribution orders are planned on a monthly basis.
所以整个库存比还是能够控制住。
So the overall inventory ratio is still manageable.

— 评委问答—天图投资合伙人魏国兴：上线6个月，现在复购的情况能看出来吗？今年会上新品吗？花椒运动创始人&CEO庞晓敏：分几个情况看。
Judge: Six months on the line, can you tell me what's new at this year's meeting? CEO Patrick Pang: In several ways.
我们隔月复购的用户占比13%左右，同时购买过我们两款产品的用户大概是25%左右。
We buy about 13% of our customers every other month, and about 25% of our customers have bought both of our products.
尤其是我们2019年12月份上线的羊绒鞋，同时购买这款产品不同尺码的用户大概达到了18%左右。
In particular, our cashmere shoes, which went online in December 2019, have about 18 per cent of customers buying them in different sizes.
我们今年有6个新款，且主打“光脚穿”，对鞋子做不同的定义。
We have six new models this year, and we're doing barefoot, with different definitions of shoes.
这里面有两个主要的系列，一个是用丝绸做运动鞋，另外一个是用玉米纤维做运动鞋，都是中国本土的材料，用新的科技去打造新的穿着体验。
There are two main lines, one made of silk and the other made of corn fibre. Both are made of Chinese material, and new technology is being used to create a new dress experience.
观摩评委：产品的供应链如何管理？花椒运动创始人&CEO庞晓敏：我们现在有三个工厂都在广东，一个在东莞，一个在中山，一个在佛山，东莞和中山的工厂都是我们合伙人自有开发的，这使得我们在开发和上游材料的研发上有非常强的把握。
CEO: We now have three plants in Guangdong, one in Dongguan, one in Zhongshan, and one in Foshan, Dongguan and Zhongshan. Our partners have developed their own plants, which gives us a lot of confidence in developing and developing upstream materials.
鞋的的尺码段决定了库存的分布和积压，我们现在基本上是5000-8000双一次下单，在非常短的时间内不停调整我们在每个尺码段上的分布，缩短货品周转期。
The size of the shoes determines the distribution and build-up of our inventory, and we are now basically placing orders between 5,000 and 8,000 pairs, constantly adjusting our distribution over each size range in a very short period of time and shortening the turnover period.
我们一款鞋在仓库的周转周期差不多只有15天。
The turnaround time of one of our shoes in the warehouse is only about 15 days.
绝大部分线上的传统品牌，一般是在30天到40天左右。
The vast majority of online traditional brands typically last between 30 and 40 days.
同题问答卖车卖奢侈品也可以转为线上种草1、线下消费受疫情冲击严重，一夜之间几乎“全民做微商”，哪些类型的项目适合转到线上，哪些不适合？转型线上的过程中，会有哪些难点，能否给出一些建议？英诺天使基金合伙人王晟：得分两个维度来看。
/ [^ # 39 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 116] / n. What kinds of projects are suitable for on-line and what are not?
第一个维度就是线上直接带动销售的品类。
The first dimension is the category of online direct selling.
它应该是实体商品，用户消费决策速度比较快、决策成本比较低，也就是说东西不能太贵、也不能太复杂、比较贴近用户需求，其实就是一些日常的消费品，特别适合转到线上。
It should be a real commodity, consumer decision-making speed, decision-making costs are relatively low, that is, things can not be too expensive, not too complex, closer to the needs of users, is a number of daily consumer goods, particularly suitable for transfer to the line.
因为现在电商直播的带货能力越来越强，这次疫情也使得大家接受程度越来越高。
Because the current live broadcast of the commercial carrier capacity is more and more strong, this outbreak has also made everyone more and more acceptable.
另一方面，对于一些重决策或者服务类产品，比如疫情期间也有不少尝试在线卖车、卖奢侈品的，这类产品原本的交付场景、履约场景在线下，也是可以转为线上种草的。
On the other hand, for some heavy decision-making or service products, such as during the epidemic there are a lot of online attempts to sell cars, luxury goods, the original delivery scene, the performance scene, can also be converted to online grass.
企业多把产品、品牌给客户种种草，也不是一件坏事。
The enterprise gives the product, the brand to the customer various grasses, also is not a bad thing.
这样至少能吸引到一些关注，获得一些私域流量，能在未来的客户转化上有所帮助。
This will at least attract some attention, get some private domain traffic, can help in the transformation of future customers.
山水创投副总经理宋晓飞：疫情或将加速包括电商、直播、短视频、游戏、知识付费等线上场景的“非接触经济”，此外，实体零售业态在疫情下为了求生，更迫切的去尝试转线上，细分品类如母婴用品、化妆品、生活消费品、服装衣帽、食品生鲜、家用电器等等都会继续加速线上化、电商化。
SONG Xiaofei, vice general manager of Landscape Venture Capital: The epidemic may accelerate the "non-contact economy" of online scenarios, including telecoms, live broadcasts, short videos, games, pay for knowledge, etc. In addition, physical retailing will continue to accelerate online and commercialized in order to survive the epidemic.
像旅游、餐饮、娱乐，文化、体育等体验性线下场景消费行业，受疫情影响已大幅降温，且无法或很难转型线上，待疫情过后才会恢复生机。
Tourism, catering, entertainment, culture, sports and other experience of the scene consumption industry, affected by the epidemic has been significantly cooled, and unable or difficult to transition line, until after the epidemic will resume vitality.
到家服务、无人零售迎来利好2、除了转线上，企业现在还有哪些方式可以尝试？英诺天使基金合伙人王晟：现在疫情期间大家也出不了门，最主要的就是到家服务了，这个方向还是可以多发展。
What are some of the ways companies can try out in addition to the turnaround? Sheng Wang, partner of the Inuit Angels Fund, can't get out of the house right now.
另外，无人零售会因为这次疫情产生一波利好。
In addition, no one retail because of the outbreak will produce a good wave of good.
如果你楼下有一个无人零售的货柜，品类相对比较多元，除了食品饮料，还会有一些蔬菜水果生鲜，甚至医疗卫生物资，会让人觉得十分便利。
If you have a non-retail container downstairs, the category is relatively diversified, in addition to food and drink, there will be some fresh vegetables and fruits, even medical supplies, will be very convenient.
疫情后餐饮业预计恢复快，旅游业迎小高潮3、疫情过去之后，会出现报复性消费潮吗？线下、线上应分别如何迎接这波消费潮？华创资本合伙人王道平：具体要看不同的行业，比如餐饮可能恢复得比较快，一日三餐是刚需但也很难报复性消费，因为很难过度消耗，估计会比较快的恢复到正常水平，酒店以及一些服务业估计也会慢慢恢复，旅行有可能会有个小高潮，因为春节的出行被抑制了，这部分会在疫情后会慢慢得到释放。
After the epidemic, the restaurant industry is expected to recover fast, tourism will face a small climax 3. After the epidemic, will there be a wave of retaliatory consumption?
对于恢复比较快的行业，各个公司相应的营销和运营动作估计会比较多而且集中，企业可以根据自身情况做一些计划，如何更好的更有效率的开展工作，避免直接竞争。
For the faster-recovering industries, the corresponding marketing and operations of the companies are expected to be more and more concentrated, enterprises can make some plans according to their own situation, how to work better and more efficiently, avoid direct competition.
山水创投副总经理宋晓飞：短期来看，线下场景消费行业会有一定恢复性反弹，毕竟这些是百姓生活的一部分。
SONG Xiaofei, vice general manager of Landscape Venture Capital: In the short term, there will be some restorative rebound in the offline scene consumer industry, after all these are part of everyday life.
但疫情下收入的阶段性减少也会影响到疫情后的消费，部分家庭、年轻群体背负负债，加上消费者的心理修复还需要一个过程，消费会比较谨慎。
But the phase of income reduction under the epidemic will also affect the post-epidemic consumption, some families, young groups to bear the debt, plus consumers psychological repair will take a process, consumption will be more cautious.
中长期看，相当比例的人群不会盲目消费，只会更加关注健康消费。
In the medium and long term, a considerable proportion of the population will not blindly consume, only pay more attention to healthy consumption.
外出就餐、聚集消费等一些消费场景会大量减少。
Some consumption scenes such as eating out and gathering consumption will be greatly reduced.
到店购买的恢复还需要一个过程。
Restoring purchases from stores will take a while.
这些改变都会在一定程度影响到疫情后的消费。
These changes will affect the post-epidemic consumption to some extent.
单纯的无人便利店玩家很难有竞争力4、去年社区无人便利店发展趋缓，疫情下能否能重获新机？一些无人社区店开始和半成品菜合作，你看好这种模式吗？看这类项目的时候你更关注哪几类数据？华创资本合伙人王道平：无人便利店在疫情之下受到了广泛的关注，从消费便利性角度来说，这也是挺好的形式，相信会有更多公司进场尝试。
[/ b] [/ b] [/ b] [/ b] [/ b] [/ size] [/ size] [/ size] [/ size] [/ size] [/ size] [size = 5] [/ size] [/ size] [size = 5] [/ size] [size = 5] [/ size] [/ size] [/ size] [/ size] [/ size] [/ size] [/ size] [/ size] [/ size] [/ size]
我觉得单纯的无人便利店玩家很难有竞争力，大的平台和公司会更有优势。
I find it hard to be competitive with simple convenience store players. Large platforms and companies have more advantages.
英诺天使基金合伙人王晟：纯粹的无人便利店短期内我们还是不是特别看好，在看这些模式的时候，主要看的还是SKU、动销、库存周转等模型。
Ino Angel Fund partner Sheng Wang: pure convenience stores in the short term we are not particularly optimistic, when looking at these patterns, the main look at the SKU, selling, inventory turnover and other models.
另外一方面就是关注效率，点位的分布、是否有前置仓、物流、补货的效率等，以及设备的稳定性，是否方便维修。
On the other hand is to focus on efficiency, point distribution, whether there is a pre-position, logistics, replenishment efficiency, and equipment stability, whether easy to maintain.
潮鞋、汉服最大的痛点在于供应链5、去年，国潮、潮玩、炒鞋、汉服等新消费趋势崛起，今年将面临哪些新挑战？在扩张、运营等方面，有哪些好的建议？英诺天使基金合伙人王晟：这些都是不可逆的趋势，这是从我们的消费群体的逐渐迭代中形成的趋势。
The biggest pain point of tidal shoes and hanfu lies in the supply chain 5. What new challenges will China face this year as a result of the rising tide of new consumption trends such as tide games, footwear and hanfu?
但是sneaker（潮鞋）这一块，我还是略微有些顾虑的，过去sneaker确实有一群很忠诚的粉丝，愿意消费和使用，但是前两年sneaker市场的暴涨，更大的驱动因素是因为炒鞋。
But I have some misgivings about the sneaker, a group of loyal fans who used to be willing to spend and use it, but the big driver of the last two years in the sneaker market was the scramble for shoes.
而我认为炒鞋实际上使sneaker背离了商品的实际价值。
And I think the hype actually takes Sneaker away from the real value of the product.
这块市场我觉得今年挑战会很大，今年甚至明年都未必会超过去年的激增。
I think this year is going to be a big challenge and this year and maybe even next year it's not going to surpass last year's surge.
上述几个趋势中，我认为最痛的环节就是供应链，尤其在汉服上面，供应链特别痛，如果这个问题解决不好，必然影响产业的发展速度，虽然用户需求很强，但供应链跟不上，设计能力和产品品质跟不上的话，就会很危险，必须要加强。
Of these trends, I believe that the most painful link is the supply chain, especially in Han Suit, where the supply chain is particularly painful and, if poorly addressed, is bound to affect the pace of industrial development. While user demand is strong, supply chains cannot keep pace and design capacity and product quality cannot keep pace, it is dangerous and needs to be strengthened.
低线人群的零售升级、健康食品、保险等存新机6、在消费领域，2020年有哪些新人群和新趋势值得关注？最近有看到比较心动的项目吗？华创资本合伙人王道平：比较关注低线人群的零售升级，另外线上线下加速融合的趋势，以及新的有特色的品牌也是我们比较关注的。
What are the new groups and trends in the consumption field in 2020? Wang Dobing, a partner in Huacheng Capital, is more concerned about the retail upgrading of low-income groups, the accelerating integration trend offline and the new distinctive brands.
比如我们投的超级零，是代餐领域很有特色的品牌，产品和营销都很有特色。
For example, our Super Zero is a very distinctive brand in the field of meal substitution, products and marketing are very unique.
山水创投副总经理宋晓飞：疫情后，人们会注重打造家庭健康环境及个人健康投资，在健康方面的消费习惯会有所改变，这里面存在很大机会。
Mr. Song Xiaofei, Vice General Manager of Landscape Venture Capital: After the epidemic, people will focus on building a healthy family environment and investing in personal health, and there will be great opportunities for changes in health spending habits.
在线问诊、远程医疗、医药O2O，互联网医疗企业迎来出圈机会。
On-line consultation, telemedicine, medicine O2O, the Internet medical enterprise ushered in the circle opportunity.
清流资本合伙人刘博：四个细分领域可能会受益。
Liquid Capital Partner Liu Bo: Four subdivisions are likely to benefit.
一个是方便产品短保化，可能意味着更健康和口味更优。
One is to make the product easier to conserve, which may mean healthier and more flavorful.
本次疫情对更高级的短保类食品是一次很大的机会和促进；第二类受益品类是健康食品，本次疫情期间对全民是一次健康理念强制大学习，未来对食品的健康要求会更突出；第三类是保险，着重在健康险种类，大家未来对看病有商业健康险的需求会更大一些；第四类，是会员管理系统产品 。
The second category of beneficiaries is healthy food, which is a health concept for the whole population during the current epidemic. The future health requirements for food will become more prominent. The third category is insurance, which focuses on the types of health insurance, where there will be greater demand for commercial health insurance. The fourth category is member management system products.
这一波事件让很多消费型企业意识到，运营自己的会员体系非常重要。
The wave of events has made many consumerist companies realize the importance of running their own memberships.
