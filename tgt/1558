疫情下的深呼吸——困境农民工家庭个案实录（之三）我担心孩子，不知道还有没有学上口述者：大朕（化名）/安徽籍打工所在地：南京编者注：大朕，男，57岁，患有脑梗和高血压，和妻子一同在南京打工，照顾孙女欣欣（化名）。
I am worried about the children, I do not know if there are any school oral: Big I (not my real name) / Anhui working place: Nanjing Editor's Note: Big I, male, 57, suffering from cerebral infarction and hypertension, I am working with my wife in Nanjing to take care of my granddaughter Xinxin (alias).
欣欣的父亲已经过世，母亲改嫁。
Xin Xin's father died and his mother remarried.
大朕回收废品，妻子做保洁工。
I will recycle waste products. My wife will be a cleaning worker.
为了孙女可以在南京读书，两个老人日复一日坚持着。
In order that their granddaughter could study in Nanjing, the two old people persisted day after day.
之前欣欣的爸爸妈妈都在南京打工，欣欣爸因为借高利贷还不上款自杀了，欣欣妈在欣欣八个月大的时候就离开了，自此以后欣欣由我和她奶奶抚养长大、供她上学，她也是我们两个老人生活的希望和依靠。
Before Xin Xin's parents are working in Nanjing, Xin Xin's father did not suicidal because he borrowed usury, Xin Xin's mother left when she was eight months old. Henceforth, XinXin was brought up by her grandmother and me to provide for her education.
我平常就在附近收一些废品，收别人不要的衣服、家电啥的再拿去卖。
I usually collect some waste products nearby, collect clothes and appliances that other people don't want, and then sell them.
一开始欣欣奶奶也是帮我收废品，后来左右邻居大家都认识了，经别人介绍，欣欣奶奶才有了保洁这个工作。
At first Xinxin grandma was also to help me collect waste products, and then about the neighbors all know, after the introduction of others, Xinxin Granny has a cleaning job.
我和欣欣奶奶都没有社保……等到老了再看，我想的是在哪里都无所谓，回去老家也不知道做什么工作，年纪大了也不能种地，现在农村种地都是机械化，收了给你放在地头上。
Granny Xinxin and I have no social security... until old age, I think it is no matter where, go back home do not know what to do, the old also can not farm, now the rural land is mechanized, received you on the ground.
而且现在种地投资挺大的，一亩地1000元的收成，投入500-600元的成本，再算上人工成本费，辛苦一季赚不到钱，也种不出来什么出路。
And now the land investment is quite large, an acre of 1000 yuan harvests, input 500-600 yuan cost, and then count labor costs, hard-earned money, not planted out of the way.
我跟欣欣奶奶说，你找一份活，房租够一些，能够生活的，苦一点也不算什么。
I told Grandma Xin Xin that you were looking for a job with enough rent to live on. It was nothing.
春节到现在奶奶也没有放假，需要去清理卫生，也不知道春节的工资怎么发，最近一直没有发工资。
Spring Festival till now grandma also did not have a holiday, need to clean up, do not know how the Spring Festival wages, has not been recently paid.
▲ 协作者社会工作者探访大朕家（摄于2018年秋季）春节一般我们也不回老家，等小孩快放假的时候车票都很难买，不会选择春节期间回。
A social worker who moves into a home when a child moves into the home during the Spring Festival (autumn 2018) is not a good time for us to return home.
我年纪大了，有脑梗和高血压，身上经常疼。
I am old, have cerebral infarction and hypertension, the body often aches.
2018年2月份犯了次病，只能回老家住院治疗，南京的药贵，也舍不得买。
February 2018, the disease, can only return to the home hospital, Nanking expensive drugs, but also reluctant to buy.
现在有时候会晕，平常要吃降压药，一盒就得几十块，每一次回老家也是为了买药，会节约钱，舍不得吃，能抗一点儿是一点儿。
Now sometimes dizzy, usually to take blood pressure medicine, a box of dozens of, every time back home is also to buy medicine, will save money, reluctant to eat, can resist a little is a little.
若在南京买药，每月支出约500元，在我们家是消费不起。
If buying medicine in Nanjing, the monthly expenditure of about 500 yuan, in our family is unable to afford.
欣欣奶奶干活比较累，经常腰疼，也不能走长时间的路。
Xin Xin grandma works more tired, often back pain, also can not walk for a long time.
我想着给她买个二手三轮车，就不会那么累了。
I wanted to buy her a used tricycle so she wouldn't be so tired.
2003年非典的时候，我也在南京。
When SARS was in 2003, I was in Nanjing, too.
这次疫情和非典的病状几乎差不多。
The epidemic is almost the same as the SARS outbreak.
那时没有措施，光说是非典，到底是什么病菌不清楚；现在科技发达，通过看电视，死了多少人都非常清楚。
At that time, there was no way to say that it was SARS, and it is not clear what kind of germs it is; technology is now so advanced that the number of people who died through watching TV is very clear.
但这次病我就觉得相当于瘟疫，发现了以后就报国家卫健委，好像是调了专家去研究。
But this disease I feel equivalent to the plague, found after the report to the National Health Committee, as if to send experts to study.
我感觉不需要恐慌，只要能研究出来是什么病，肯定有方法；类似最简单的牙疼，肯定是有措施应对。
I don't feel the need to panic, as long as you can find out what the disease is, there must be a way; like the simplest toothache, there must be measures to deal with it.
不过我看新闻还没有研究出来结果。
But I don't see the news coming up yet.
关于试剂盒，我知道是用来测试阴性还是阳性，应该阳性是新型冠状病毒那种病。
With regard to the kit, I know it is used to test negative or positive, should be positive for the new coronavirus that disease.
现在哪个超市口罩都买不到，附近超市都写着断货，还好奶奶干活那边物业有发的，家里之前也有一点备用的。
Now no supermarket masks can be bought, the nearby supermarket are written out of stock, but grandmother works there property, there is a little back-up at home.
▲协作者社会工作者探访大朕家（摄于2019年春季）目前对我们的影响主要是不能外出。
A social worker visiting a home with him (taken in the spring of 2019) has a major impact on us right now.
我的工作是去捡废品，拿到回收站去卖，春节废品回收站本来也不开门，估计初十也不开门，我也不知道什么时候开门。
My job is to pick up waste products, to get to the recycling center to sell, Spring Festival waste recycling station was not open, I do not expect the opening of the tenth, I do not know when to open.
现在也没有什么人出门，也捡不来废品，今天有人打电话给我收废品，我也不知道往哪里放。
No one is going out or picking up junk, and I don't know where to put it today because someone called me to collect it.
如果疫情持续时间再长点，也不知道怎么办，现在只能在家里待着，但我更担心的是孩子的学习。
If the epidemic continues a little longer, do not know how to do, now can only stay at home, but I am more worried about the children's study.
现在离开学还有些日子，你看着她，她才会去学习；不是大人管她，学一会就不学了。
Now leave school some days, you look at her, she will go to study; not adults care about her, learn a while will not learn.
这段时间放假了，小孩的心情懒散，早晨不起床，习惯养成是个大问题。
This time off, the child's mood is lazy, do not get up in the morning, habit formation is a big problem.
▲ 困境儿童欣欣手写的课程表（摄于2019年秋季）欣欣对学习不用心，看着也可怜。
Children in difficulty are delighted with the handwritten curriculum (taken in the autumn of 2019) XinXin is not interested in learning, looking at the poor.
上次期末考试语文考得可以，数学和英语不好，没有人辅导，带小孩我们老人也没有办法。
We did well in our last final exam in Chinese, we didn't do well in math and English, we didn't have anyone to help us, and we didn't have children.
孩子马上要升初中，不知道还有没有学可以上，如果能有学上，我和奶奶这么大年纪在南京打工多苦都值得！社会工作者手记跟爷爷通完电话，能感受到爷爷的无奈与期盼。
The child is about to go to junior high school, I do not know if there is any school to go to, if there is a school, my grandmother and I in Nanjing at the age of more than worth working!
他担心奶奶的身体，操心着孙女的学习情况。
He worried about his grandmother's health and his granddaughter's studies.
突发的疫情，孩子延期开学，课业无人辅导、习惯养成……都是爷爷最关心的问题。
Outbreak of the epidemic, children postponed school, no tutoring, habit formation... Grandpa is the most concerned about.
面对自身受文化水平的限制，在知识文化层面存在现实的难题，爷爷不得不低下头。
Facing the limitation of his own literacy level, there is a real problem in the knowledge and culture level, Grandpa had to bow his head.
