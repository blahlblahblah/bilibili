希望情况尽快能得到改善武汉医院现在防护服短缺，一线医护人员不敢吃饭、喝水、上厕所，因为医用防护服是一次性的，一旦脱下就要换新的。
Wuhan hospital is short of protective clothing, front-line medical personnel do not dare to eat, drink, toilet, because the medical protective clothing is a one-time, once take off will be replaced.
本刊记者/周群峰 摄近日来，网上有关于武汉市医务人员被感染的消息出现。
This print journalist / Zhou Qunfeng in recent days, online about Wuhan City medical personnel have been infected with the news.
武汉市某三甲医院眼科副主任医师张馨就是一名感染了新型冠状病毒的肺炎患者，她向《中国新闻周刊》讲述了自己得病前后的经历。
Zhang Xin, an ophthalmologist at a hospital in Wuhan, is a pneumonia patient infected with the new coronavirus. She told China News Weekly of her experiences before and after her illness.
大约在一周前，我所在的病区接到很多发热病人，当时说是甲流或者乙流，所以对他们只做了常规筛查，该住院还是住院，只是注意防控。
About a week ago, there were a lot of febrile patients in my area who said it was swine flu or swine flu, so they were routinely screened, hospitalized or hospitalized, just for control purposes.
后来，门诊陆续也有很多这样的病人，医生们当时也只是戴着普通的医用口罩。
Later, the outpatient department also has many of these patients, the doctors are also wearing only ordinary medical masks.
接诊了几个病人之后，我在1月20号下午开始出现了畏寒、发热的症状。
After attending to several patients, I began to show signs of chills and fever on the afternoon of January 20th.
第二天凌晨，我到我们医院的发热门诊就诊。
The next morning, I went to our hospital's fever clinic.
当时是将近凌晨一点钟，我挂到的就诊号是324号。
It was almost one o'clock in the morning, and my number was 324.
我根本进不去门诊，前面排队的患者真的是太多太多了。
I can't get into the clinic at all. There are too many patients in front of me.
我只能打电话给同事，让他们告诉我需要做哪些检查。
I can only call my colleagues and ask them to tell me what tests I need to do.
因为我是医院的大夫，可以在我们医院开单子。
Since I'm a doctor at the hospital, I can write a list in our hospital.
那个时候，还没有N95口罩，我只能戴着自己的普通外科口罩，给自己开化验单，做检查。
Back then, before I had a N95 mask, I had to wear my own general surgical mask, write out my own slip and take a test.
检查结果出来之后，再通过微信发给我们发热门诊的同事看。
After the results of the examination came out, we sent a message to our colleagues at the fever clinic.
他们给我开了奥司他韦、阿比多尔等抗病毒药物，我自己去药店买药。
They prescribed antiviral drugs like oseltamivir and abidol, and I went to the drugstore to buy them myself.
到药店后发现，那里只有一种抗病毒的药，而且只剩一盒了，仅够吃两天。
I went to the drugstore and found that there was only one antiviral drug there, and there was only one box left, just enough for two days.
这两天吃完之后，到处买都买不着，只能托熟人去买。
After two days of eating, everywhere can not buy, can only trust acquaintances to buy.
好在我是医务人员，还能找人到其他专科医院去买，然后寄给我，我不知道那些得病的普通老百姓怎么办。
Luckily, I'm a medic and I can get someone to go to another specialist hospital and send it to me. I don't know what to do with the sick ordinary people.
我是星期一发病的，那时候，我们医院还不能做冠状病毒检测。
I fell ill on Monday, when our hospital was unable to do a coronavirus test.
直到22号，医院才能做，我就去检测了，发现有一项指标是阳性。
The hospital couldn't do it until the 22nd, so I went to the test and found that one of the indicators was positive.
那个时候，我也住不了院，因为病房都满了。
At that time, I could not live in hospital, because the wards were full.
我就自己找了一个地方，一个人隔离。
I found a place for myself, isolated.
家人每天都到隔离地点给我送饭。
My family comes to the quarantined area every day to bring me food.
每天吃饭时，都是家人送到门口放在地上，敲三声门，等他们走了之后，我才敢开门拿。
Every day at dinner, the family members are sent to the door on the ground, knock on the door three times, after they left, I dare not open the door to take.
据我所知，医务人员感染的情况其实是很多的。
As far as I know, there are many cases of infection among medical personnel.
我算轻症，肺部情况没有那么严重，可以给自己治疗。
I am a mild case, the lung condition is not so serious, can give oneself treatment.
如果是重症，按规定就要转到定点医院。
In case of serious illness, transfer to a designated hospital as required.
但因为定点医院人满为患，我们科室有的人肺部出现了问题，就只能在我们医院的一个病区隔离治疗。
However, due to overcrowding in designated hospitals, some people in our department have lung problems, can only be isolated in one of our hospital areas for treatment.
截至目前，仅我们科室发现检测结果呈阳性的医务人员起码有5个了。
So far, only our department has found positive test results of at least five medical personnel.
那些一线科室的医生肯定有更多感染的。
Doctors in the front-line departments must have had more infections.
1月23日凌晨，武汉宣布“封城”了。
In the early morning of January 23, Wuhan announced the "closure" of the city.
封城后，我们临床一线医生的防护用品一直短缺。
After the closure of the city, our clinical front-line doctors have been short of protective supplies.
虽然全国各地，包括海外都有爱心人士捐款、捐物，但是这些东西进不来，因为中间渠道不通畅。
Although there are charitable donations and donations all over the country, including overseas, they do not get in because the middle channel is not open.
医院不能自己去接受捐赠，而是要先汇报，再通过红十字会统一接收、发放，要走流程。
Hospitals can not accept donations themselves, but to report first, and then through the Red Cross unified reception, distribution, to go through the process.
武汉现在已经分区封闭了，在这样的情况下，还需要上级疏通各个部门，从交通运输到物资的接受、分发，如果是海外寄送的物资，还要经过海关、检验检疫。
Wuhan has now been closed, in such a situation, it is necessary for superiors to dredge departments, from transportation to the receipt and distribution of goods, and, in the case of goods sent abroad, through customs, inspection and quarantine.
但现在上级部门禁止各个医院私自去接受捐款、捐物，为解决燃眉之急，我们现在只能是自己花钱去买。
But now the higher level department forbids each hospital to accept the donation, the donation privately, in order to solve the urgent problem, we can only buy it at our own expense.
为解决这个问题，我们医院和其他几家三甲医院只好越过武汉市卫健委，集体发布了接受社会捐助的公告。
To solve this problem, our hospital and several other three-A hospitals had to go over Wuhan Health Commission, collective issued a public announcement to accept social donations.
这样的做法实在是医院的无奈之举。
Such a practice is really a hospital act of helplessness.
通过这样的法子，现在物资比最开始的时候要充裕一些了，但还依然还是不够。
In this way, supplies are now a little more plentiful than they were at the beginning, but they are still not enough.
比如，现在有隔离服了，但还是不够用。
For example, there are quarantine suits now, but they are not enough.
一线医生和我说，因为隔离服不够用，他们不敢吃饭、不敢喝水、不敢上厕所，因为一旦脱下防护服做这些事情，再重新穿时就要换新的。
The front-line doctors told me that they were afraid to eat, drink or use the toilet because the isolation suits were inadequate, because once they had taken off their protective clothing to do these things, they had to replace them when they re-wore them.
我们的麻醉师插管没有护目镜，就用泳镜，后来连泳镜也买不着了。
Our anesthesiologist used goggles instead of goggles, and later he couldn't get them.
我们科有护士去发热门诊支援，第一天没有防护服，只有一个N95口罩，没有戴护目镜，结果三天后，她再检查的时候，三项抗体全是阳性。
We had nurses to go to the fever clinic, no protective clothing on the first day, only a N95 mask, no goggles, so three days later, when she checked again, all three antibodies were positive.
昨天是农历年大年三十。
It was Chinese New Year's Eve yesterday.
值班同事和我说，她们在医院，一边看着春晚，一边在哭。
My colleague on duty told me that they were in the hospital, watching the Spring Festival Gala, crying.
我现在虽然指标已经转阴了，但还在隔离中，没有切身处在那个环境里，很难体会。
I'm still in isolation, not in that environment, it's hard to understand, although the indicators are overcast.
我们还是边缘科室，不是真正的一线。
We're still the fringe, not the real line.
那些真正在一线的医护人员，那些在网上视频里大哭的医务人员，我想她们的心态真的是崩溃的。
The real front-line health care workers, those crying in the online video, I think their mentality is really crumbling.
这就像一个战士，没有枪，还要去上战场。
It's like a warrior, without a gun, on the battlefield.
我昨天去发热门诊检查的时候，还看到有患者对着医生大骂。
When I went to the fever clinic yesterday, I saw patients yelling at the doctor.
政府现在应该已经重视物资紧缺这个问题了，但在物资补足之前的空档期，有多少人会有风险呢？我不知道。
The government should be paying attention to the shortage of supplies by now, but how many people will be at risk in the interim until supplies are replenished? I don't know.
我只希望这种情况尽快能得到改善，每个医生能得到防护，每个护士都不被感染。
I only hope that this situation will improve as soon as possible, that every doctor will be protected and that every nurse will not be infected.
