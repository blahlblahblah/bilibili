1月20日官方公布的感染武汉新型冠状病毒患者激增之前，武汉街头看起来和平时没多少不同。
Before the official January 20 official surge in infection with Wuhan's new coronavirus, the streets of Wuhan did not look much different than usual.
从1月20日开始，戴口罩的人突然多了起来。
From January 20 onwards, the number of people wearing masks suddenly increased.
但其实这场病毒的袭击从大约一个月前就开始了，直到今天才引起更大范围的注意。
But the virus attack began about a month ago, and it is only today that it has gained wider attention.
记者 | 王珊 张从志 吴琪华南海鲜市场：移动的病人▲▲▲碰到华南海鲜市场的商贩黄昌，对我们来说是个意外。
Wangshan Zhang Congzhi Wuqi South China Seafood Market: Mobile Patient: It was an accident for us to meet Huang Chang, a seller at South China Seafood Market.
市场早已于2020年1月1日关闭，昨天距离市场关闭已经三周了，傍晚时我们抱着不大的希望，想去华南海鲜市场了解更多情况。
The market closed on January 1, 2020, three weeks after the market closed yesterday, and in the evening we had little hope of going to the South China seafood market for more information.
黄昌正从他已被关闭的摊位走出来，店里存了不少货品，他不放心，所以过来看看。
Huang was coming out of his closed stall. He had a lot of things in it. He was not sure, so he came over and looked at it.
56岁的他戴着一个一次性的口罩，整个人看起来很是苍老，精神状态也不好。
The 56-year-old wore a disposable mask and looked old and mentally ill.
他淡定地告诉我们，他就是武汉新型肺炎患者，他老婆李桂芳也是，然后邀请我们去他家聊聊。
He calmly told us that he was the new Wuhan pneumonia patients, his wife Li Guifang, and then invited us to his home to chat.
武汉华南海鲜市场黄昌夫妇住的小区就在华南海鲜市场东区背面，几乎是一墙之隔，步行回家不过四五分钟。
Wuhan South China Seafood Market Mr. and Mrs. Huangchang live in a small area just beyond the eastern side of the South China Seafood Market, just four or five minutes walking home.
这是一个上了年头的老小区，小区狭窄的路旁堆满了各种货物。
It was an old neighborhood of old, with narrow roadside piles of goods.
他告诉我们，楼上楼下住了不少在华南海鲜市场做生意的租户，大家平时生意忙，虽然面熟得紧，但私下没什么来往，他叫不上名字。
He told us that there were a number of tenants upstairs and downstairs who were doing business in the South China seafood market. They were very busy, and though they were familiar with each other in private, he couldn't name them.
据他了解，光那一栋楼里就有好几人疑似感染。
As far as he knows, several people in that building alone are suspected to be infected.
病人不是该隔离在医院吗？为什么黄昌和老伴仍然在家呢，而且行动也并没有受限制？黄昌告诉我们，他1月20日刚刚从武汉市第十一医院（即武汉市红十字会医院，是一家二级医院）出院，出院记录上写的入院诊断是：重型肺炎（不明原因），出院诊断为：病毒性肺炎。
Why is Huang Chang and his wife still at home and there is no restriction on their activityHuangchang told us that he had just been discharged from Wuhan 11th Hospital (i.e. Wuhan City Red Cross Hospital, a level II hospital) on January 20th.
黄昌被送去武汉市红十字会医院后没几天，他的爱人李桂芳也出现了类似症状：浑身没劲，发热、同时伴随轻微咳嗽，没有食欲。
A few days after Huangchang was taken to Wuhan Red Cross Hospital, his wife, Li Guifang, developed similar symptoms: fatigue, fever, mild cough and loss of appetite.
她一向身体很好，那两天却发现爬楼梯回家都做不到了。
She had always been in good health, but for two days she had found it impossible to climb the stairs and go home.
1月11日她也去了武汉市红十字会医院。
On January 11, she also went to Wuhan Red Cross Hospital.
她告诉我们，经过检查，医生告诉她已经被感染，不过情况轻微，不需要隔离，只要每天来打吊瓶，9天一个疗程。
She told us that, upon examination, the doctor told her that she had been infected, but that the condition was minor and did not require isolation, as long as she came to the bottle every day for nine days of treatment.
21日下午见到她时，李桂芳刚从医院打完针回来，她说接下来几天还要继续去医院。
When I saw her on the afternoon of the 21st, Li Guifang had just returned from the hospital and said she would continue to go to the hospital for the next few days.
医务人员身着防护服接诊（中新社供图）病人在家和医院之间自由行走，不就是个移动的传染源吗？夫妻俩对这点没多少概念，不过李桂芳告诉我们，黄昌病情严重时，他们因为担心不被收治也说了谎。
Is the free movement of medical staff between home and the hospital a source of infection? The couple have little idea of this, but Li told us that when Huangchang was seriously ill, they lied for fear of not being admitted.
黄昌告诉本刊，元旦期间，华南海鲜市场封市后，商户都做了登记，后来回访的时候，他并没有把自己的症状告诉回访人员，也没有说自己在打针吃药。
Huangchang told this print that during the New Year's Day period, after the South China seafood market was closed, merchants registered, and when he returned, he did not tell the callers of his symptoms, nor did he say he was taking the medicine.
等到撑不住了，自行前往武汉红十字医院，黄昌开始也没有告诉医生自己就在华南海鲜市场工作，只说在附近住，给了租房的地址。
When he couldn't hold up, he went to Wuhan Red Cross Hospital and didn't tell the doctor that he was working in South China Seafood Market.
“我想，那天如果说我是在华南海鲜市场工作，他们肯定不会收我。
"I don't think they would have accepted me if I had worked at the seafood market in southern China that day.
”黄昌的女儿是护士，好多同学都在医院工作，他们后来从女儿那里听说，好多医院都不收海鲜市场的病人。
Huang's daughter, a nurse, worked in a hospital and later heard from her daughter that many hospitals did not accept seafood market patients.
“我蛮幸运的，去医院的时候我没有说实话。
"I was lucky I didn't tell the truth when I went to the hospital.
”早期症状：浑身无力▲▲▲在黄昌的印象里，华南海鲜市场最先出现症状的，是他旁边卖鱼虾的老板娘，50多岁。
Early symptoms: In Huang Chang's impression of the South China seafood market, the first symptoms of the sale of fish and shrimp next to his wife, over 50.
那还是2019年12月中旬，她先是浑身没劲，紧接着发高烧。
It was the middle of December 2019, when she first had no energy and then a high fever.
她觉得只是小感冒，挨了几天后却没好，随后被送进了医院。
She thought it was just a small cold, after a few days but did not recover, and was then sent to the hospital.
黄昌好奇，问了下对方老公，对方说，“蛮严重，肺部都感染了。
Huangchang curious, asked the other husband, the other side said, "quite serious, lung infection.
”此时，没有人知道她已经感染了新型冠状病毒。
At this point, no one knew that she had contracted the new coronavirus.
黄昌和得病的老板娘都是华南海鲜市场的老店家了。
Huangchang and his sick mother-in-law are old-timers in the South China seafood market.
从市场建设以来，黄昌就在这里卖海鲜水产。
Since the construction of the market, Huangchang has been selling seafood here.
这家位于武汉市江汉区发展大道207号的市场，被新华路劈成东西两区，与汉口火车站和客运中心步行只要几分钟，附近商场、写字楼林立。
The market, located at 207 Jianghan District Development Avenue in Wuhan, is split east and west by Xinhua Road. It is only a few minutes' walk from Hankou Railway Station and Passenger Terminal Center.
作为此次疫情的发源地，市场已于1月1日关闭，除了巡逻人员很少能够看到商贩，曾经的热闹，被萧瑟和死寂所替代。
As the birthplace of the epidemic, the market closed on January 1, except for patrol personnel can rarely see the traders, once lively, was replaced by bleak and dead.
年底本来是市场最忙的时候，黄昌也已经囤了几千斤货物。
At the end of the year, when the market was busiest, Huang Chang had hoarded several kilos of goods.
整个华南海鲜市场原本都是一副备战春节的喜气洋洋状态。
The entire South China seafood market was originally a pair of preparations for the Spring Festival jubilant state.
黄昌所在的西区500多个档口都在忙着买卖。
More than 500 stalls in the western part of Huangchang are busy buying and selling.
附近区县的餐馆、市场很多来这里进货。
The nearby district and county's restaurant, the market many come here to purchase goods.
黄昌说，在卖鱼虾老板娘住院后，紧接着出现问题的是对面档口卖干果的一对夫妻。
Huangchang said that in the sale of fish and shrimp madame hospital, immediately after the problem is the opposite file selling dried fruit of a couple.
病情跟前者类似，浑身无力。
The condition is similar to the former, all weak.
黄昌眼瞅着对方每天去打针，回来抱着个大缸子喝了好几天水，也没好转。
Huangchang looked at each other every day to do needles, back to hold a jug of water for several days, also did not improve.
直到有一天，对方的儿子在卖货，他才知道，人已经送到了武汉协和医院。
It was not until one day that the other's son was selling the goods that he learned that the man had been taken to Wuhan Concord Hospital.
后来才知道，对方肺部严重感染，发高烧一度到了41度。
Later learned that the other side of the lung is seriously infected, a high fever once reached 41 degrees.
元旦过后，黄昌身体就开始感到不适，浑身没劲，从楼下爬上他们住的四楼越来越吃力，后来便开始发热、咳嗽。
After New Year's Day, Huangchang began to feel unwell and tired. From downstairs, he climbed to the fourth floor of their house.
在社区门诊打了三天吊水，他记得有感冒常用的药物，如头孢，但症状并未见好，反而继续加重，1月6下午，黄昌才被家里人送进了武汉市红十字会医院。
After three days of suspension at the community clinic, he remembered having common cold medicines, such as cefta, but the symptoms did not improve but continued to increase.
即使如此，几乎没有人知道，让他们生病的病毒后来被叫做“新型冠状病毒”的病毒。
Even so, few knew that the virus that made them ill was later called the "new coronavirus."
后来关于病毒的溯源都指向了华南海鲜市场里售卖的野生动物。
The virus has since been traced to wild animals sold in the South China seafood market.
网上流传出的一张图片显示，一家名为“大众畜牧”的摊位售卖的野味种类多达42种，包括竹鼠、狗狸獾、猪狸獾、果子狸、狐狸、树熊、孔雀、大雁等，“均可活杀现宰，速冻冰鲜，送货上门”。
A picture circulated on the Internet shows that a stall called "Popular Animal Husbandry" sells 42 kinds of game including bamboo rats, beaver badgers, beaver badgers, beavers, foxes, koalas, peacocks and geese.
网传华南海鲜市场野味价目图昨天，在华南海鲜市场东区，我们看到了一家同名的店铺，店面朝着新华路，十分显眼，不过目前已经拉上了卷帘门。
South China Seafood Market Game Price Chart Yesterday, in the eastern part of the South China Seafood Market, we saw a shop of the same name with a prominent face towards Xinhua Road.
在市场里做了十几年生意的黄昌夫妇告诉本刊，华南海鲜市场里卖野味的摊位并不算多，主要还是以海鲜鱼虾为主，但他们知道确实有摊位在售卖野兔和蛇之类的野味。
The Huangchang couple, who have been doing business in the market for more than a decade, told the magazine that there were not many game stalls in the south China seafood market, mainly seafood fish and shrimp, but they knew there were stalls selling game such as rabbits and snakes.
根据2020年1月21日中国科学院上海巴斯德研究所等机构发布的论文研究显示，武汉新型冠状病毒基因组与2002年“非典”SARS冠状病毒、“中东呼吸综合征”MERS冠状病毒平均分别有~70%和~40%的序列相似性。
According to a paper published on January 21, 2020 by the Shanghai Pasteur Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan's new coronavirus genome bears an average sequence similarity of ~ 70% and ~ 40% with the SARS coronavirus and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome respectively.
研究成果预测了武汉冠状病毒有很强的对人感染能力。
The results of the study predict that Wuhan coronavirus has a strong ability to infect people.
邻居和自己的相继发病，并没引起他的注意。
His neighbours and his own sequelae did not catch his attention.
黄昌觉得，冬天流感高发，大家只不过是得了严重的感冒而已。
Huangchang felt that the high incidence of influenza in winter, we are only suffering from a severe cold.
到了2019年12月30日，一份疑似武汉卫健委发布的《关于做好不明原因肺炎救治工作的紧急通知》在网上流传，其中提及武汉多家医疗机构陆续出现多例不明原因肺炎病例，并与华南海鲜城有关联。
By December 30, 2019, a suspected Wuhan Health Committee issued the "Emergency Notice on the Treatment of Unknown Causes of Pneumonia," circulated online, referring to a number of cases of unexplained pneumonia in Wuhan medical institutions, linked to the southern city of Hai Xian.
12月31日这天市场的气氛开始紧张，一早就有很多身着防护服、背着喷雾器的医务人员出现在市场里消毒。
On 31 December, the atmosphere in the market began to be tense, with many medical personnel in protective clothing and sprayers disinfecting the market early in the day.
1月1日，黄昌等人就接到了市场当天要关闭的信息。
On January 1, Huangchang and others were informed that the market would be closed that day.
讽刺的是，这天武汉市公安局发布了一条通报，声称日前因为一些关于“武汉病毒性肺炎”的不实信息在网络流传，公安部门对此进行了调查，他们依法处理了8人，原因是散布不实信息。
Ironically, on this day Wuhan Public Security Bureau issued a notice claiming that public security departments investigated the spread of false information about Wuhan virus pneumonia, and they handled eight people in accordance with the law for spreading false information.
20天后，在针对“新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情”有关防控情况记者问答会上，国家卫健委高级别专家组组长钟南山院士证实了武汉肺炎的“人传人”现象，且有医护感染。
20 days later, in response to the "new coronavirus infection pneumonia" related to the prevention and control of a question and answer session, the National Health Commission High-level Expert Group Leader Zhong Nan-shan confirmed that Wuhan pneumonia "human-to-human" phenomenon, and there are medical infections.
而在此之前，2019年12月31日，武汉市卫健委的通报声称病毒性肺炎“未发现人传人现象”。
Prior to that, on December 31, 2019, Wuhan City Health Commission reported that viral pneumonia "no human-to-human phenomenon."
2020年1月15日，武汉卫健委发布新型冠状病例感染的肺炎疫情问答表示，调查结果表明，病毒性肺炎尚未发现明确的人传人证据，不能排除有限人传人的可能，但持续人传人的风险较低。
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan Health Commission issued a new coronary infection of pneumonia Qian Qian, the results of the investigation showed that no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of viral pneumonia could not be ruled out, but the risk of continuous human-to-human transmission was low.
医院艰难的防疫战▲▲▲“今天有个年纪很大的患者，被120送来后躺在担架上，很久都没有人搭理他。
The Hospital's Difficult Preventive Warfare "There was a very old patient today, 120 sent to lie on a stretcher, for a long time no one paid attention to him.
他年纪很大了，躺在床上眼睛一直没有睁开。
He was too old to lie in bed with his eyes open.
”李桂芳说，她这一周多往返医院，看到的“基本是年纪比较大的人，年轻的看着也有40多岁，很少能看到年轻人。
Li said she spent more than a week commuting to the hospital to see "mostly older people, with younger ones looking in their 40s and few young people.
”病人太多，医院添置了很多挂吊瓶的支撑架，将整个急诊挤得满满当当的。
There were too many patients, and the hospital filled the emergency room with many braces for hanging bottles.
从外界来看，就是在黄昌出院的1月20日左右，武汉的新型肺炎病例数字突然多了起来。
From outside, it is in Huangchang hospital around January 20, Wuhan, the number of new pneumonia cases suddenly increased.
但是对于一直身处武汉医疗一线的部分医生来说，早就意识到情况的严重性。
But for some doctors who have been on the front lines of Wuhan medicine, the seriousness of the situation has long been recognized.
一位综合医院的骨干医生张晓文（化名）告诉本刊说，她所在的医院，十天前床位就紧张了。
Zhang Xiaowen (not her real name), a leading doctor at a general hospital, told the magazine that beds had been strained 10 days earlier in her hospital.
从2019年12月中下旬开始，来医院的不明原因肺炎病人增多，但是即使后来新型冠状病毒在逐步查明，外界又表明这种病毒的检测试剂盒供应充足，医院仍然不容易得到检测盒。
Since late December 2019, there has been an increase in the number of patients with unexplained pneumonia who have come to the hospital, but even as the new coronavirus is gradually being identified and there is evidence of a sufficient supply of test kits for the virus, hospitals will still not have easy access to test kits.
曾经通过社交媒体等渠道，对这轮肺炎疫情表示担心的医生，被约谈。
Doctors who had expressed concern about the outbreak, including through social media, were interviewed.
“我们作为实力很强的综合医院，有隔离病房，但隔离病房哪里跟得上这一轮病人的增长？”医务人员正在转移患者黄昌和李桂芳分别于1月6号、1月11日开始到医院看病，见到医生护士戴着口罩，并无其他防护。
"We are a very strong general hospital, with an isolation ward, but where can we keep up with this round of patient growth?" Medical staff are moving patients from Huangchang and Li Guifang to the hospital on January 6 and January 11 respectively, seeing doctors and nurses wearing masks and having no other protection.
李桂芳说，大约看病两天后，她所去医院的医护人员穿上了防护服、戴上了护目镜，裹得严严实实的。
About two days later, Li said, the hospital staff at her hospital had donned protective clothing and goggles and were wrapped up in protective clothing.
医院发热门诊和急诊科的人也越来越多。
Fever clinics and emergency departments are also becoming more common in hospitals.
1月11日那几天她去打针，从挂号到输液完成只需要三个小时，现在光挂号就要排很久，算下来一天得7个小时耗在医院里。
On the 11th of January, when she went for an injection, it took only three hours from registration to completion of the infusion, and now it took a long time to register and seven hours a day to spend in the hospital.
作为2019年12月22日就“中招”的小吴，年仅23岁。
Wu, a 23-year-old boy, was recruited on December 22, 2019.
小吴是黄陂人，在汉口火车站附近做销售，那里离他租的地方很近，他每天骑自行车上下班，以前也从未去过海鲜市场。
Xiao Wu, a Huangpi, does sales near Hankou Railway Station, near where he rents it. He commutes to work every day and has never been to a seafood market before.
小吴记得那天下了点小雨，他没带雨衣雨伞，就绕了几段路，路过了华南海鲜市场北边的华南水果批发市场，进去逛了一下就出来了。
Xiao Wu remembered that it was raining a little. Without his raincoat umbrella, he made a few detour through the South China Wholesale Fruit Market in the north of the South China Seafood Market.
两天后，小吴感觉身体不舒服，开始反复低烧，出汗不止，他觉得是“路上可能淋了点雨，着了凉”。
Two days later, Wu felt unwell and began to suffer from repeated low fever and sweating. He thought it was "maybe drizzled with rain and caught a cold."
一位戴着口罩的市民骑车经过华南海鲜市场。
A masked citizen rides past the South China seafood market.
几天后就诊时，小吴对正在发酵的肺炎一无所知，在医院做血常规和肝功能筛查，发现有两项异常，医生建议他去大医院。
A few days later, Wu did not know about the fermentation of pneumonia, in the hospital for routine blood and liver function screening, found two abnormalities, the doctor advised him to go to the big hospital.
在家又待了一个周末后，2020年1月1日，小吴到了武汉协和医院，情况非常严重后，他被转到武汉金银潭医院（即武汉市医疗救治中心）。
After spending another weekend at home, on January 1, 2020, Xiao Wu arrived at Wuhan Concorde Hospital. After the situation was very serious, he was transferred to Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital (Wuhan Medical Treatment Center).
在金银潭医院，小吴和两个患者待在一起。
At the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital, Xiao Wu stayed with two patients.
“他们的情况比我轻一些。
"They're a little lighter than I am.
一个是在华南海鲜市场里做搬运工，老板卖生猪肉、排骨，另一个是50多岁的老阿姨，家住在市场附近。
One is a stevedore in a South China seafood market. The boss sells raw pork and chops. The other is an old aunt in her fifties who lives near the market.
不过她后来被证明是感冒，5天左右就出院了，之后很快又转进了一个人。
But she turned out to have a cold and was discharged about five days later, before being transferred to another person.
”小吴告诉本刊，因为病人增多，1月10日，他所在的金银潭医院将病人分为两类，症状轻的在一起，症状严重的则在一个房间。
Xiao Wu told the magazine that on January 10, his gold and silver pool hospital had divided patients into two categories, with mild symptoms and severe symptoms in one room.
小吴与另外三名患者住在一起。
Xiao Wu lives with three other patients.
“我那时身体状况已经比较好，他们三个人基本全天在吸氧状态，情况很差。
"I was in better health and the three of them spent most of the day taking in oxygen, which was very bad.
”在武汉某三甲医院的主任医生费青（化名）说，如果在十多天前就面对真实情况，对这轮疫情严阵以待，情况会好得多。
'It would have been much better if we had faced the real situation more than a decade ago, 'said Fei Qing, director of a hospital in Wuhan.
现在他所在的医院很难接受新来的病人了，因为现有病人已经使得医院在超负荷运转了，医护人员被感染的人数并不少。
It is difficult for his hospital to accept new patients now, because the existing patients are already overloading the hospital, and the number of hospital staff infected is not insignificant.
1月21日，武汉火车站候车大厅，戴着口罩的旅客在候车。
Mask-wearing passengers wait in the waiting hall of Wuhan Railway Station on January 21.
（中新社供图）2020年1月21日，武汉市新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情防控指挥部在当天召开的新闻发布会上陈述了床位紧张的问题。
On January 21, 2020, the Pneumonia Prevention and Control Command for the New Coronavirus Infection in Wuhan City presented the issue of bed strain at a press conference on the same day.
武汉市卫健委副主任彭厚鹏在会上表示，目前武汉安排了三家定点医院800张床位用于收治病人，还将在最短时间内腾出1200张床位，所有确诊病人均可享受免费救治。
