经济观察网 记者 瞿依贤 湖北省第三人民医院呼吸内科医生胡晟在除夕这天拿到了自己的CT片子：双肺几乎全白。
Economic Watch reporter Qu Yexian Hubei Third People's Hospital Respiratory physician Hu Sheng got his CT picture on New Year's Eve: Both lungs are almost entirely white.
他科室的同事看到结果，好几个都哭了。
His office colleagues saw the results and several of them cried.
。
.
胡晟是在发热门诊被感染的。
Shengong Hu was infected at the fever clinic.
湖北省第三人民医院在1月8日开设发热门诊，他从呼吸内科调到发热门诊担任负责人，门诊的 “人都堆起来”，到现在，胡晟所在医院被感染的医护人员大约有30人。
On January 8, the Third People's Hospital in Hubei Province opened a fever clinic. He was transferred from the Department of Respiratory Medicine to take charge of the fever clinic.
。
.
胡晟告诉经济观察网记者，湖北省第三人民医院呼吸科原本只有1个病区，现在扩展到了4个病区，其中2个病区专门收治本院医护人员，“每个病区大概十几个人”。
Zhisheng told the Economic Observation Network that the respiratory department of the Third People's Hospital in Hubei Province, which used to have only one area, has expanded to four disease areas.
。
.
武汉大学中南医院（下称“中南医院”）医护人员感染的情况比湖北省第三人民医院更严重。
The infection rate of medical staff in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University was more serious than that of the Third People's Hospital in Hubei Province.
。
.
根据《美国医学会杂志》（JAMA）发表的中南医院重症医学科主任彭志勇团队的文章，截至1月28日该院的138例病人中，41.3%可能通过院内感染发生，57例院内感染的人中有40例为医护人员。
According to an article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) by Peng Zhiyong, director of severe medicine at Zhongnan Hospital, as of January 28, 41.3% of the 138 patients in the hospital were likely to have nosocomial infections, and 40 of the 57 nosocomial infections were hospital staff.
。
.
2月3日流传的一张医务人员发病情况图表显示，湖北省报告15例以上确诊医务人员病例的医院有15家，武汉协和医院、武汉大学人民医院、武汉市第一医院、武汉大学中南医院、武汉市第四医院和武汉同济医院等都名列其中。
A medical staff morbidity chart circulated on February 3 showed that 15 hospitals in Hubei Province reported more than 15 confirmed cases of medical personnel, including Wuhan Concorde Hospital, Wuhan University People's Hospital, Wuhan City First Hospital, Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan Fourth Hospital and Wuhan Tongji Hospital.
。
.
多位武汉呼吸科医生也对经济观察网表示，医护人员实际感染的数量只会比上述图表上的数字更多。
Wuhan respiratory doctors also told the Economic Watch network that the number of cases actually infected by medical staff would only be higher than the figures on the chart.
不完全统计，目前武汉市医护人员感染数已经在千例以上。
Incomplete statistics, Wuhan City, the number of hospital staff has been infected with more than 1,000 cases.
。
.
一例医护的感染，很可能意味着其所在一组医护人员失去前线的作战能力，这对收治病人能力的巨大缺口更是雪上加霜。
A medical infection may well mean that a team of health-care workers is incapacitated at the frontline, adding to the huge gap in patient capacity.
。
.
2月9日，湖北省委书记、新冠肺炎疫情防控指挥部指挥长蒋超良表示，要确保未收治患者清零，意义在于隔离收治速度要跑赢病毒传播的速度，否则物资和医护还会紧缺。
On February 9, the secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee and commander of the Xinguan Pneumonia Prevention and Control Command, Jiang Jiuliang, said the point was to ensure that the number of untreated patients was kept to a minimum.
。
.
经济观察网获悉，2月8日，全国再次动员超过2200名专科医护人员驰援武汉。
The Network was informed that on 8 February, more than 2,200 specialized medical personnel were again mobilized throughout the country to assist Wuhan.
目前所有在汉的有执业医生资格的退休人员、转岗人员和医学院学生，都被招募起来共抗疫情。
At present, all retirees qualified as medical practitioners, laid-off workers and medical students in Han are recruited to fight the epidemic.

决战打响。
The decisive battle started.

武汉“决战” 全国驰援。
Wuhan "decisive battle" of the country to help.
2月9日，湖北省委书记、新冠肺炎疫情防控指挥部指挥长蒋超良在一线表示，要确保未收治患者清零，坚决打赢集中收治的“歼灭战”。
On February 9, the Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee and Commander of the New Crown Pneumonia Prevention and Control Command, Jiang Zhaoliang, said on the front line that we must ensure zero treatment of untreated patients and resolutely win the "war of annihilation" of centralized treatment.
。
.
继上一轮物资、场地问题得到缓解后，收治问题的矛盾集中在了专业医护缺乏的问题上。
After the last round of material and site problems were alleviated, the problem of admission focused on the lack of professional medical care.
。
.
据经济观察网了解，目前所有在汉的有执业医生资格的退休人员、转岗人员和医学院学生，都被招募起来共抗疫情。
According to the Economic Observation Network, all retirees, transfer workers and medical students currently qualified as medical practitioners in Han have been recruited to fight the epidemic.
。
.
这仍然远远不够。
That is still far from enough.
继此前数轮调集医护人员赴含援助后，国务院再次从各地调集超过2200名专门团队。
The State Council has again mobilised more than 2,200 specialized teams from around the world, following previous rounds of mobilisation of medical personnel for assistance.
另外，全国多个省份领导的一省包一市（湖北省地级市）的行动也已经紧锣密鼓展开。
In addition, a number of provinces led by a province Baoyi City (Hubei Province) action has also been intensified.

经济观察网获得一份国务院应对新冠肺炎疫情联防联控机制（医疗救治组）2月8日下发的《关于请上海市等有关单位组派医疗队援助湖北应对新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情的函》（下称《请医疗队援助湖北函》）显示，华中科技大学同济医学院附属同济医院光谷院区的16个重症病区和1个重症监护室（ICU）需“整建制接管”。
The Economic Observation Network obtained a letter from the State Council on February 8 on asking relevant units in Shanghai to send medical teams to help Hubei cope with the new coronavirus pneumonia ("Letter of Assistance from Medical Team to Hubei"), 16 severe cases and one intensive care unit (ICU) of Tongji Hospital attached to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
16个重症病区由南京、无锡、苏州、杭州、宁波、厦门、青岛等市组建医疗队接管，ICU由复旦大学附属华山医院（下称“华山医院”）组建30名医生和180名护士接管。
Sixteen critically ill areas were taken over by medical teams from Nanjing, Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Xiamen and Qingdao. The ICU was taken over by 30 doctors and 180 nurses from Huashan Hospital, affiliated with Fudan University.
。
.
《请医疗队援助湖北函》显示，16支重症患者救治医疗队每支需组建医疗队员130名，包括临床医生30名和护理人员100名，17支队伍共计需组建2290名医疗队员，“做好2月9日前往湖北武汉支援的各项准备，尽量配置7天的防护物资”。
A letter from the medical team on assistance to Hubei shows that each of the 16 medical teams for the treatment of serious patients needs to form 130 medical team members, including 30 clinicians and 100 nurses. A total of 2,290 medical personnel will be needed from 17 teams.
。
.
华山医院医疗队第一个报名的是感染科教授陈澍，消化科、抗生素研究所也随后报名。
Huashan Hospital medical team was the first to sign up Professor Chen Shu, the Department of Digestive and Antibiotics Research Institute also signed up.
担任上海市医疗救治专家组组长的张文宏也报名：上海这边情况稳定了，他也可以去，不过出于上海医疗救治的考虑，华山医院未批准张文宏的报名。
Zhang Wenhong, head of the Shanghai Medical Treatment Expert Group, also signed up: Shanghai is stable and he can go, but Huashan Hospital has not approved Zhang's application for medical treatment in Shanghai.
。
.
45分钟，华山医院报名人数已经超过210人，最后确定由曾经在SARS救治第一线工作的呼吸科主任李圣青担任队长，34名医生的专业包括呼吸、感染、重症、血液、消化、肾脏、神经内科、抗生素、内分泌等。
In the past 45 minutes, more than 210 people have signed up for the Huashan Hospital. Li Shengqing, the respiratory director who has been on the front line of SARS treatment, has been designated as the team leader. The 34 specialties include respiration, infection, severe disease, blood, digestion, kidney, neurology, antibiotics and endocrine.
组建完毕后，华山医院214人出征武汉。
After the establishment of 214 people in Huashan Hospital in Wuhan.

截至2月9日下午，国家卫健委已累计从全国调派11921名医护人员驰援湖北。
By the afternoon of February 9, the National Health Care Commission had dispatched a total of 11,921 medical personnel to Hubei province.

民航数据显示，9日当天，武汉天河机场共迎接来自全国各地的40余架次医疗队航班、共计5000余名医疗队员，这是天河机场迎接外来力量最多的一天，航班来自上海、天津、辽宁、河北、山西、江苏、浙江、广东、四川、山东、河南、福建等地。
According to civil aviation data, Wuhan Tianhe Airport welcomed more than 40 medical team members with a total of 5,000 crew members from all over China on the 9th. The flight was from Shanghai, Tianjin, Liaoning, Hebei, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Sichuan, Shandong, Henan and Fujian.

第一波感染与“没有人传人”。
The first wave of infection with "No-one-to-human".
随着抗疫的深入，医护人员的大规模感染问题，在这次疫情中起到的负面效应是逐步露出水面的。
With the deepening of the fight against the disease, the large-scale infection of medical personnel, in this outbreak played a negative effect is gradually emerging.
。
.
根据前述会议中流出的汇报图表，中南医院确诊和疑似病例分别为50例和17例，彭志勇告诉经济观察网，医护感染的实际数字只会比这更多，因为现在“时间点不一样，是动态的数据”。
Peng told the Economic Watch network that the actual number of health-care infections would only be higher because "time is different, it's dynamic data," Peng told the Economic Watch.
。
.
“前面（通报）说没有传染，所以很多人没注意。
"There was no infection, so a lot of people didn't notice," he said.
那个时候很多病人到医院里面看病，医生和护士也没什么防护措施，这是第一波医护感染。
At that time many patients went to the hospital, doctors and nurses did not take protective measures, this is the first wave of medical care infection.
”彭志勇说。
'he said.

2019年12月30日，就在李文亮等医生发出预警的同时，湖北省第三人民医院呼吸科住院部也接诊了新冠肺炎患者，不过胡晟和同事在当时并不知道这是什么病，治疗方法按照病毒性肺炎进行。
On December 30, 2019, just as doctors such as Li Wenliang issued an early warning, the Department of Respiratory Inpatient of the Third People's Hospital in Hubei Province also treated patients with Newcastle Pneumonia, but Sheng Hu and his colleagues did not know what the disease was, and the treatment was based on viral pneumonia.
。
.
等到有同样症状的患者越来越多，医院开了发热门诊。
As the number of patients with the same symptoms increased, the hospital opened a fever clinic.
1月8日到发热门诊上班以后，胡晟每天接诊100多个病人，每天有一半病人的肺部CT都有着相似的症状——磨玻璃样病变。
Since arriving at the fever clinic on January 8, Zhisheng has treated more than 100 patients every day, and half of his patients have similar lung CT symptoms - grinding glass-like lesions.
。
.
“在发热门诊的那十几天，感觉把上班十几年来的病毒性肺炎都看完了，我觉得这种情况很不正常，因为不可能同一时间短期内出现这么多相似的病例，这基本上是以前从来没见到过的。
"During the 10 days of the fever clinic, I felt like I had seen all the viral pneumonia at work for more than a decade, and I thought it was very unusual because it was not possible to have so many similar cases in a short period of time, something that I had never seen before.
”胡晟判断这次的病毒性肺炎不是一般的病毒。
"Sheng Hu said the virus was not a common one.
。
.
胡晟，受访者供图。
Sheng Hu, interviewee for picture.
根据武汉市卫健委1月3日通报，不明原因肺炎“未发现明显的人传人现象，未发现医务人员感染”；1月7日，本次不明原因病毒性肺炎病例的病原体被判为新型冠状病毒。
"No human-to-human transmission has been found and no infection among medical personnel has been found," said Wu Han Health Commission on Wednesday. On January 7, a new coronavirus was found in the pathogen of an unidentified viral pneumonia.
。
.
去发热门诊之前，在住院部工作的胡晟接诊了2例新冠肺炎病例，“就按照普通的病毒性肺炎去处理，也没有意识到要上防护措施”。
Prior to going to the fever clinic, Zhisheng Hu, who worked in the inpatient department, had treated two cases of Newcrown Pneumonia, "treating them as normal viral pneumonia, without realizing that protective measures were required."
。
.
跟胡晟情况类似，从肺炎疫情开始，武汉大学人民医院呼吸内科危重症专家、副主任医师余昌平每天都要接触很多病人，并没有严格的防护措施。
Similar to Hu Sheng, from the outbreak of pneumonia, Wuhan University People's Hospital Respiratory Medicine experts, deputy chief physician Yu Changping every day to many patients, there are no strict protective measures.
“有一次急诊科会诊，一天下来三个全是的；还有一次，我在发热门诊参加一次病情会诊，那个病人在汉口华南海鲜市场二楼工作的，我作为临床医生，一看他就是冠状病毒肺炎。
"There was an emergency consultation, three at the end of the day, and another time I was attending a consultation at the fever clinic where the patient worked on the second floor of Hankou South China Seafood Market.
”。
"
余昌平不知道自己在什么时候被感染，1月14日他开始发烧，白天烧晚上烧，烧到38°5。
Yu Changping did not know when he was infected, January 14 he began a fever, burning at night, burning until 38 ° 5.
17日科室同事要一起吃年夜饭，余昌平担心自己是新冠肺炎传染给同事就去做了CT，一起检查的还有另一名同事，结果出来两个人都有问题，一起住进了医院。
17 section colleagues to eat New Year's Eve dinner together, Yu Changping worried that he was the new crown pneumonia infected colleagues to do CT, together with another colleagues, the results of both people have problems, live together in the hospital.
。
.
胡晟所在的呼吸科，算上主任有9位医生，加上护士一共有30多人，到现在有六七位已经被感染，好在都是轻症，已经基本痊愈。
Zhisheng's respiratory department, which includes nine doctors and more than 30 nurses, has so far infected six or seven of them. Fortunately, they are very mild and have basically recovered.
全院同事中有一位神经内科的危重症医生被转移到金银潭医院，在重症监护室待了很久，病情也有反复。
A critical physician from the Department of Neurology was transferred to the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital, where he stayed in intensive care for a long time.

值得注意的是，上述图表显示，武汉市第一医院在2019年12月27日就出现了医务人员感染，湖北省中西医结合医院在1月1日发现，武汉同济医院和武汉市红十字医院在1月5日首发，而武汉市卫健委在1月11日的通报中称：“1月3号以后没有新发病例，未发现明显人传人、未发现医务人员感染”。
On January 1, 2019, Wuhan Tongji Hospital and Wuhan City Red Cross Hospital started operation, and no new cases were found after January 3, no apparent human-to-human transmission and no cases of infection among medical personnel, "Wuhan Health Commission said on January 11.
。
.
保障缺乏专业度有限。
Lack of professionalism in safeguards is limited.
从外省看，驰援武汉的医护人员力量已经有近12000人，其中至少有3000多名是重症专业的医生和护士。
From the provinces, Wuhan has nearly 12, 000 medical personnel, including at least 3,000 doctors and nurses specializing in severe diseases.
如果医护感染得不到遏制，本就紧张的救援资源会更加紧缺。
If health-care infections are not contained, already stretched relief resources will become even more scarce.
。
.
《请医疗队援助湖北函》中明确，这次招募医护人员的专业，主要包括呼吸与危重症、传染病或感染病，重症医学科。
"Ask medical team to assist Hubei letter to clarify that the recruitment of health care professionals, including breathing and critical, infectious or infectious diseases, severe medical science.
新冠肺炎表现出的强传染性，让武汉更加缺乏相关科室的医护人员。
New crown pneumonia shows strong infectivity, make Wuhan more lack of medical personnel of relevant departments.
。
.
胡晟的妻子在武汉市红十字医院下属的社区医院工作，武汉市红十字医院距离华南海鲜批发市场直线距离1.5公里，1月22日被征用整体转为传染病医院，胡晟的妻子估计武汉市红十字医院有1/6的医护人员被感染。
His wife works in a community hospital run by Wuhan Red Cross Hospital, which is located 1.5 kilometers from the South China Seafood Wholesale Market. On January 22, the hospital was requisitioned and turned into a hospital for infectious diseases.
。
.
支援武汉市红十字医院的四川省人民医院重症医学科主任黄晓波在接受采访时表示，1月26日武汉市红十字医院已经有30多名医护人员住院，另有30多名医护人员被隔离，“每天大七八百发热患者到红会的发热门诊看病，疑似患者和普通发热患者混杂在一起，整个医院都被污染了”。
Huang Xiaobo, director of severe medicine at the Sichuan People's Hospital in support of Wuhan Red Cross Hospital, said in an interview that on January 26 more than 30 medical personnel had been hospitalized and more than 30 medical personnel isolated.
。
.
“武汉市红十字医院现在是定点医院，定点医院的压力非常大，一整栋楼全部病房都是收新冠肺炎病人，感染几率、感染的风险那是成倍的增加。
"Wuhan Red Cross Hospital is now a designated hospital, the pressure on designated hospitals is very large, a whole ward of patients with pneumonia, infection rate, the risk of infection is doubled.
” 胡晟说，从环境来看，发热门诊接诊数量多，“人都堆起来了，环境也比较狭小、密闭，是高危环境”，呼吸科病房也相对危险，接诊的病人症状比较重，病毒量比较高，传染性相对强。
From an environmental point of view, the number of outpatient visits to the fever clinic is high. "People are piling up and the environment is relatively small and closed, which is a high-risk environment," says Shengong Hu.
。
.
武汉大学人民医院也是医护感染的“重灾区”，前述图表显示，该医院医务人员确诊92例，疑似102例，首发在1月10日。
The Wuhan University People's Hospital, also the worst-hit area for medical attention, showed that the hospital's medical staff diagnosed 92 cases and suspected 102 cases, starting on January 10.
随着时间的推进实际数字是否更多？余昌平没有正面回答，叹了一口气说，“这个不好说”。
With the advance of time whether the actual number of more? Yu Changping did not answer positively, sighed and said, "This is not easy to say."
。
.

如果说第一波医护感染是因为没有防护意识，第二波传染则可能是因为防护物资不够。
If the first wave of health care infections is due to a lack of awareness, the second wave of infections may be due to inadequate protective materials.
彭志勇科室的副主任去对口帮扶的武汉市第七医院的ICU支援，发现对方ICU有2/3的医护人员被感染，医生很缺防护物资，在明知感染的情况下“裸奔”也还是要上。
Peng Zhiyong, deputy director of the department to help the Wuhan City VII hospital ICU support, found that the other side of the ICU two-thirds of the health-care personnel were infected, doctors are short of protective supplies, in the knowledge that the infection "streaked."
。
.
“整个的防护东西缺乏，后面病人多起来以后，防护物资不够所以医生没有办法得到防护，” 彭志勇对经济观察网表示，“按道理说防护不到位不能上，上的话相当于‘自杀’。
"The whole thing is missing, there's not enough protection after more patients, so doctors can't get protection," Pang told the Economic Watch. "It's not safe to go without protection, it's suicidal.
”。
"
胡晟的同门中，有很多都在县级医院工作，防护物资比武汉更缺乏，“防护措施是最要命的地方，跟病人近距离接触了，比如说没有穿防护服，口罩或者护目镜，一个小小的细节，不注意可能就会有问题”。
Many of Zhisheng's colleagues work in county-level hospitals, where protective materials are more scarce than in Wuhan. "Protective measures are the worst place to come into close contact with patients, such as not wearing protective clothing, masks or goggles, a small detail that can be problematic without attention."
。
.
标准防护与公共卫生。
Standard protection and public health.
2019年12月27日，湖北省中西医结合医院呼吸内科主任张继先发现4个可疑病例，上报江汉区疾控。
On December 27, 2019, Zhang Jixian, director of respiratory medicine in Hubei Province combined with Western Medicine, discovered 4 suspicious cases and reported them to the Jianghan District CDC.
。
.
以此计算，新冠肺炎疫情发展至今已经超过1个半月。
In this calculation, the new crown pneumonia epidemic has developed for more than a month and a half.
湖北省尤其是武汉市目前的医护感染情况，除了前期信息披露不及时、疾病本身的特征之外，也暴露了整个医疗防控体系的诸多问题。
The current medical and nursing infection in Hubei province, especially in Wuhan city, has exposed many problems of the whole medical control system besides the untimely information disclosure and the characteristics of the disease itself.
。
.
国家突发公共卫生事件应急专家咨询委员会委员、武汉大学公共卫生学院教授谭晓东在接受经济观察网采访时表示，这次疫情中医护人员被感染的原因有很多：医护人员的标准防护不到位，包括防护水平、程序、保障等；其次，医院控制水平和能力建设不够；第三是医院公共卫生事件应急救援行动不足。
In an interview with the Economic Observation Network, Tan Xiaodong, a professor at Wuhan University School of Public Health and a member of the National Expert Advisory Committee on Public Health Emergencies, said in an interview with the Economic Observation Network.
。
.
值得注意的是，截至2月9日晚上9时，日本已经确诊新冠肺炎89例，新加坡确诊40例，泰国确诊25例，韩国确诊25例，马来西亚、越南、德国、法国、美国、澳大利亚等国家确诊病例也超过10例，但至今国外还没有发现1例医护感染。
It is worth noting that as of 9 February, 89 cases of New Crown Pneumonia had been confirmed in Japan, 40 cases had been confirmed in Singapore, 25 cases had been confirmed in Thailand and 25 cases had been confirmed in the Republic of Korea, and more than 10 cases had been confirmed in Malaysia, Viet Nam, Germany, France, the United States and Australia.
谭晓东认为原因是国外病例少，防护力量够大。
Tan Xiaodong thinks the reason is foreign case is few, the protection strength is big enough.
。
.
以武汉为中心的疫情让谭晓东很感慨，突发公共卫生事件中传染病、食物与职业中毒已经屡见，医源性的一直不受重视，这次实际上也已经形成了以医院为主要疫源地的事件，“当人们有发热或怀疑自己有感染的时候，都蜂拥至医院，这样医院就成了一个重要的感染场所，未感染的病人可能在医院被感染，而医务人员如果防护稍有疏露，就会被感染”。
With Wuhan as the center, Tan Xiaodong lamented that infectious diseases, food and occupational poisoning in public health emergencies had become common, that iatrogenic events had been neglected and that hospitals had become a major focus of infection.
。
.
经济观察网检索发现，2003年SARS的4500多例病患中，被感染的医务人员占到20%，一方面说明病毒传染性高，另一方面说明医院作为交叉感染地带，风险高。
A search by the Economic Watch found that, of the more than 4,500 cases of SARS in 2003, 20 per cent were infected with medical personnel, indicating, on the one hand, the high prevalence of the virus and, on the other hand, the high risk of hospitals as a cross-infection zone.
。
.
中南医院重症医学科在1月6日接收了1位从黄冈来的重症病人，尽管一开始就判断这例病人可能传染性很强，彭志勇还是收治了，同时上报医院，将急诊进行改造，按照SARS的标准严格防护。
The department of intensive care at Zhongnan Hospital accepted a critically ill patient from Huanggang on January 6. Although he initially thought the patient might be highly contagious, he admitted the patient to hospital for emergency treatment and strict protection against SARS.
最后彭志勇的科室还是有人被感染，“这个病毒传染性很强”，防不胜防。
Finally, Pang Zhiyong's department or someone was infected, "this virus is very infectious", prevent too much.
。
.
哈佛大学公共卫生学博士、北京大学公共卫生学院教授宁毅在《知识分子》的访谈中说，现在医生和护士作为一个紧密合作的团队，工作和衣食住行基本上都在一起，一名医务人员感染了，这一团队可能就得隔离14天之后才能重新投入工作。
In an interview with Intellectuals, Harvard University's PhD in Public Health and professor of public health at Peking University, Ning Yi, said doctors and nurses are now working as a close-knit team that basically works together, eats, clothes and walks together.
在目前医疗资源短缺的情况下，保护医生、护士在当地非常重要，保护他们，就是保证救治体系的效率，因此，医护人员的防护保障必须跟上去。
In the face of the current shortage of medical resources, the protection of doctors and nurses is very important in the local area, to protect them, to ensure the efficiency of the treatment system, so that the protection of medical personnel must follow suit.
。
.
回头看这次疫情爆发的全过程，早期的信息披露不透明、随后的防护物资跟不上，谭晓东将这些总结为“多年的顽疾总爆发”：从上到下，从卫生系统到全社会，只注重临床实践而忽视公共卫生，医院公共卫生与医务人员公共卫生标准化工作都存在不足。
Looking back over the course of the outbreak, where early disclosures were opaque and subsequent protective materials failed to keep pace, Tan summed up these as "years of chronic disease": from the top down, from the health system to society as a whole, focusing on clinical practice to the neglect of public health.
。
