记者/ 魏晓涵 梁婷 韩谦 佟晓宇实习记者/ 陈威敬 胡琪琛编辑/杨宝璐宋建华医护人员严阵以待 摄影/高瞾2019年12月30日，武汉市卫计委内部文件流出，称“武汉出现不明原因的肺炎”，与华南海鲜批发市场有关。
Journalist / Wei Xiaohan Liang Ting Tong Xiaoyu Intern Reporter / Chen Weijing Hu Qi Chen Editor / Yang Polo Song Jianhua Medical Personnel Ready for Photography / Gao Zhen Wen On December 30, 2019, Wuhan Municipal Planning Commission internal documents flow, said that "Wuhan has an unknown cause of pneumonia," related to the South China seafood wholesale market.
次日，华南海鲜批发市场迎来了大规模消毒。
The next day, South China Seafood Wholesale Market ushered in mass disinfection.
2020年1月3日，武汉市卫计委发布通报，截至2020年1月3日8时，共发现符合不明原因的病毒性肺炎诊断患者44例，其中重症11例，目前所有病例均在武汉市医疗机构接受隔离治疗，并追踪到121名密切接触者进行医学观察。
On January 3, 2020, the Wuhan Municipal Health and Planning Commission announced that as of 0800 hours on January 3, 2020, a total of 44 patients with unidentified viral pneumonia had been found, 11 of them seriously.
未发现明显的人传人证据。
No significant human-to-human evidence was found.
1月9日，北青深一度正式启动对此次新冠肺炎疫情的报道，首篇报道采访了曾参与SARS会诊的专家曹志新。
On January 9, 2007, Beiqing Sheng officially launched a report on the outbreak of new crown pneumonia. The first report interviewed Cao Zhixin, an expert who participated in the SARS consultation.
今天，距离最初发出报道的时间，已经过去了整整一个月。
Today, a full month has passed since the original report was issued.
在这一个月里，疫情发展每天都在牵动着人们的心：1月9日，武汉出现首例新冠肺炎死亡病例；1月19日，武汉市百步亭社区举办“万家宴”；1月20日，钟南山在接受采访时表示新冠病毒存在“人传人”的情况；1月25日，火神山医院开建；1月31日，武汉协和医院请求社会支援；2月7日，“吹哨人”李文亮医生离世，国家监察委赴武汉调查……继续追踪疫情新动态的时候，我们没有忘记回头看。
On January 9, Wuhan had its first case of death from pneumonia. On January 19, Wuhan hosted a "family dinner" for the Baibuting community. On January 20, the Huoshen Hospital asked for social support. On January 31, the "whistler" Li Wenliang died.
我们带着读者的关心和疑问，回访了部分采访对象。
With the reader's concern and questions, we visited some of the interviewees.
希望通过复盘他们这一个月来的生活、工作轨迹，将那些更加细致入微的变化呈现出来。
The hope is to remake their life this month, the trajectory of work, those more nuanced changes presented.
左：曹志新 右：童朝晖专家：坚守工作岗位，疫情仍不容小觑曹志新（朝阳医院西院呼吸与危重症医学科副主任）往期报道：SARS防控专家眼中的武汉不明原因肺炎曹志新如今在北京的工作岗位上，这次他不在发热门诊，但新冠肺炎对他来说并不遥远。
Chao Zhixin, deputy director of respiratory and critical medicine at Chao Zhixin Hospital, Chao Zhixin (deputy director of respiratory and critical medicine at Chaoyang Hospital) reported in previous issues.
北京大部分医院都是综合医院，对于综合医院的发热门诊而言，诊断新冠肺炎病人和收治常规病人同时进行。
Most hospitals in Beijing are general hospitals. For the fever clinics of general hospitals, the diagnosis of patients with new crown pneumonia goes hand in hand with the admission of routine patients.
对他所在的常规诊室来说，需要收治常规肺炎病人。
For his regular room, regular pneumonia patients need to be treated.
如何甄别新冠和常规的肺炎病人，避免错误的收治给整个门诊带来麻烦，成为当务之急。
How to distinguish between new crowns and regular pneumonia patients, to avoid the wrong treatment to the entire clinical trouble, has become an urgent matter.
北京的返工潮还没来，他告诉记者，朝阳医院西院进入待命状态，他们已经做好了“打硬仗的准备”。
Beijing has yet to return to work, he told reporters, Chaoyang Hospital West courtyard into a state of readiness, they have "prepared to fight hard."
他的一些同事被派到武汉或北京其他定点医院支援，原本手头的工作分给了驻守北京的医生，再加上发热门诊诊断的工作量增加，每个医生的工作负荷比平时高出许多。
Some of his colleagues were sent to Wuhan or other designated hospitals in Beijing, where the work was assigned to doctors stationed in the capital, which, combined with the increased workload of clinical diagnosis, resulted in a much higher workload per doctor than usual.
原本使用量很少的N95口罩、一年都用不上一件的防护服都用上了，医院的防护物资也紧张起来。
Less-used N95 masks and less protective clothing for a year have been used, and hospital protection has been strained.
“非常紧张，（物资）用不了两三天，没有了，快没有的时候又能来一点。
Very nervous, not for two or three days, no, not soon enough to come again.
”据曹志新介绍，从肺炎病人里甄别新冠肺炎，做到百分百准确很难，他所在的朝阳医院采取的方法是——对所有的肺炎病人做两次核酸检测，显示阴性后，依旧集中隔离治疗，在发热门诊之外建立一个缓冲带，和常规大病房里的病人分开。
The method used by Chao's Chao Yang hospital, which screens all pneumonia patients for 100 per cent accuracy, is to test all pneumonia patients twice for nucleic acid tests and, after negative results, still concentrate on isolation treatment, creating a buffer zone outside the fever clinic and separating from patients in the regular sick room.
在北京，并非所有的医院都建立起了类似的防火墙，这也是他现在担心的地方。
Not all hospitals in Beijing have built a similar firewall, which is what worries him now.
“如果甄别做得不好，容易造成极大损失。
"If the screening is not done well, it is easy to cause huge losses.
之前西城区那边就出现过一次小爆发了。
There had been a small explosion in the western part of town.
”此前，北京市疫情防控发布会披露，西城区的复兴医院出现新冠肺炎的聚集性病例，感染的9人中，有5人是医护人员。
Earlier, Beijing's epidemic prevention and control conference revealed that the Xicheng District Renaissance Hospital had a concentrated case of New Crown Pneumonia, with five of the nine people infected being health-care workers.
童朝晖（北京朝阳医院副院长、呼吸危重症专家）往期报道：“中国顶级SARS病房”专家童朝晖：目前重症患者没有减少趋势，核酸检测已引入第三方自1月18日抵达武汉后，童朝晖从未中断过工作 。
Children Chaohui (Vice-President of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital and Respiratory Critical Disease Specialist) has reported in the past: "China's top SARS ward" expert Tong Chaohui: There has been no decrease in severe cases, nucleic acid testing has been introduced to a third party since January 18, the arrival of Wuhan, children Chaohui never interrupted work.
目前，他仍在继续参与金银潭、中南医院等医院的重症和危重症患者临床救治工作。
At present, he continues to participate in the gold and silver pool, Zhongnan Hospital and other hospitals of serious and critical patients in clinical treatment.
童朝晖称，接下来总体方案将会有一个调整，未来数天将组成几个专家组，由市一级的专家配合，将二十几家区属医院的重症病人转到定点医院。
Mr Tong said there would be a "reshuffle" of the overall plan over the next few days, with teams of experts working with city-level experts to refer serious cases from more than 20 district hospitals to designated hospitals.
据童朝晖介绍，现在除金银潭医院、武汉肺科医院外，又新增协和医院西院、同济医院中法新城院区、湖北省人民医院东院这三家分院作为重症患者救治的定点医院。
According to Tong Chaohui introduction, now in addition to gold and silver pool hospital, Wuhan lung hospital, and add Concorde Hospital West Hospital, Tongji Hospital in France Xincheng District, Hubei Province People's Hospital East Hospital these three hospitals as a hospital for the treatment of serious patients.
接下来的工作，是将区属医院中的重症患者甄别出来，然后转到以上几家定点的重症患者救治医院，“目前这项工作已经开展两三天了”。
The next step is to identify patients in regional hospitals who are seriously ill and then refer them to the more targeted intensive care hospitals. "It's been two or three days now.
对于此前媒体提到的相关治疗药物，童朝晖称，有一些药物是在实验室、体外证明有效，但是不代表在临床就有效，因此在人体上是否有效，还得经过临床实验，不能轻易下判断。
Regarding previous media references to the relevant treatment drugs, Tong said that some drugs in the laboratory, in vitro proved to be effective, but does not represent clinical effectiveness, so in humans, the effectiveness of clinical trials, can not be easily judged.
2月6日有一种来自美国的药刚到，将开始临床试验，具体疗效如何尚有待判断。
On Feb. 6, a new drug from the United States is due to begin clinical trials, and the exact effect remains to be seen.
“我听说的适应症都在轻症和中度的患者”，对于重症和危重症患者，童朝晖认为还是要依靠综合治疗，“不能靠任何一根救命稻草”。
"The indications I've heard are for people with mild or moderate illnesses," Tong said, referring to severe and critically ill patients who still rely on comprehensive treatment and "cannot rely on any single lifesaving straw."
童朝晖还称，重症患者的救治需要时间，一般重症患者到ICU以后，至少也得经过10天至半个月的治疗，然后才可以拔管等，随后好转，这都需要时间。
Children Chaohui also said that the treatment of severe patients need time, after the general severe patients to ICU, at least 10 days to half a month after treatment, then can be pulled, and so on, and then improved, which takes time.
同济医院的病床患者：有人痛失亲人，有人治愈出院王康（已康复的新冠肺炎感染者）往期报道：一个武汉肺炎康复患者的样本观察：我与新型冠状病毒搏斗的22天如今王康和爸妈一起住在武汉郊区，他们最近都没出门。
2007-3-1 15: 53: 00 Tongji Hospital Bed Patient: Some people have lost loved ones, some have cured Wang Kang, a patient who recovered from Wuhan pneumonia. A sample observation: I battled a new coronavirus for 22 days.

只是到了复查的日子，暂时还去不了医院，他打算等武汉解封以后，再去医院复查。
Only to review the day, temporarily can not go to the hospital, he intends to wait for Wuhan unsealing, then go to the hospital to review.
庆幸的是，父母和陪伴他战胜病魔的姐姐均未受到感染，姐姐离开医院时，进行了检查，尽管无恙，但她还是处理了自己的衣服，换了全套的新衣服，并进行了自我隔离。
Fortunately, neither his parents nor his sister, who had been accompanying him through the ordeal, had been infected, and when her sister had left the hospital, she had examined her clothes, changed them completely and isolated herself, although unharmed.
如今，王康还时常跟姐姐视频聊天，王康说，值得珍惜的永远是自己的亲人。
Today, Wang Kang also often and sister video chat, Wang Kang said, is always worth cherishing their loved ones.
梁岩（肺炎感染者）往期报道：抗击新型冠状病毒的基层医院：发热门诊排长队，防疫物资现短缺，送检需有疫区接触史新冠肺炎全面爆发之后，各地发热门诊排起了长队，感染肺炎却迟迟没法就诊的梁岩选择了求助媒体。

在辗转上海的两家医院、几个科室后，梁岩终于在1月22日晚打上了点滴，从八点半到凌晨一点，挂了三瓶点滴之后，抗病毒的药物在她体内开始起作用，体温也逐渐恢复正常。
After tossing and turning two hospitals and several departments in Shanghai, Liang Yan finally made a drip on the evening of January 22. From 8: 30 to 1: 00 a.m., after hanging up three bottles, the antiviral drugs began to work in her body and her temperature gradually returned to normal.

她复查完，发了一条朋友圈——“医生说，肺恢复得非常好，感谢这段日子收到的每一份关心，大家都要好好的。
She reviewed it and sent out a circle of friends. "The doctor says his lungs are doing very well. Thanks for all the attention I've received these days, everyone needs to be well.
”向瑜（新冠肺炎感染者家属）往期报道：武汉城外的重负：地县乡三级抗疫遭遇的百万返乡潮但并非所有感染者都能等来好消息。
To the families of those infected with the new crown pneumonia: a heavy burden outside Wuhan: a million people returning home from the third-class epidemic in counties and townships but not all infected people can wait for good news.
1月23日晚，向瑜的母亲刚住进随州市中心医院的时候，并没有明显的虚弱和呼吸困难。
On the night of January 23, when Ms. Yu's mother was admitted to the central hospital in Suizhou, she did not suffer from obvious weakness or breathing difficulties.
但到28日复查时，CT显示母亲的双肺全白，次日病危住进ICU。

2月3日，向瑜56岁刚退休的母亲离世。
On February 3, he passed away to his mother, a 56-year-old retired mother.
向瑜见母亲最后一面时，隔着病房门，她看到母亲向自己伸出了手，想要握住什么。
As she came to see her mother for the last time, across the ward door, she saw her mother reach out to her and try to grasp something.
母亲走了之后，向瑜不时在想，“不知道她（当时）有多孤单多害怕，想让她来梦里找我，也没有”。
From time to time after her mother left, she thought to herself, "I don't know how lonely and frightened she was. I didn't want her to dream of me.

他不坐市民的爱心车队，每天步行1小时10分钟去医院；他仍不让相恋四年的女友回到武汉，这次女朋友没和他吵架，而是在家复习考研；他还是不能和父母见面，只能在下班的回家路上给他们打个电话问候家中情况。
He still refuses to let his girlfriend of four years go back to Wuhan. Instead of quarrelling with him, his girlfriend reviewed for the postgraduate examination at home. He still cannot meet his parents and calls them on his way home from work to ask about the situation at home.

He told reporters that recently the management of hospital supplies has become more stringent and that material management offices have been set up in each section, requiring doctors to fill out forms, instructions and applications for any material.
他们想了很多节省物资的小技巧：口罩重复回收使用，用酒精消毒后放置温箱风干；平日的物资都是泡在酒精里消毒，现在他们将酒精装在喷壶里，喷着消毒。
They thought about a lot of material-saving tips: reuse the mask, sterilize it with alcohol and air-dry it in a incubator; usually it's soaked in alcohol, and now they spray it in a spray bottle and sterilize it.
