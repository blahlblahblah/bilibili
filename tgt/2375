疫情之下，你们把快递小哥当成什么了为了60套秋衣秋裤，武汉快递小哥贾胜治开启“扫街”模式，跑遍辖区所有门店，几经波折买齐了这批紧缺物资。
Under the epidemic situation, you take express brother as what for 60 sets of autumn pants, Wuhan express brother Jia Shengzhi opened the "sweep of the street" mode, all over the jurisdiction, after several twists and turns to buy the scarce supplies.
这是内蒙古援鄂医疗队6名护士10天的“战斗服”。
This is the Inner Mongolia medical team Hubei six nurses 10 days of "combat clothes."
他把这批物资和父母连夜包的100个饺子送到医疗队驻地时，专门带上了蒸锅碗筷，心里想着妈妈念叨的话：“不知道我们南方人包的饺子，大夫们爱不爱吃”……贾胜治父母连夜包了100个饺子，让他带过来给医疗队。
When he took the goods and 100 dumplings from his parents' overnight bag to the medical station, he took the chopsticks from the steamer and thought about what his mother said: "I don't know the dumplings made by our southerners, but the doctors love them."
在武汉封城的36天里，贾胜治其实一直在跑。
For 36 days in Wuhan, Jia Shengzhi actually ran away.
2月末的武汉，天气在多云和小雨之间徘徊，正如过去的每个初春。
At the end of February in Wuhan, the weather hovered between cloudy and light rain, as it used to be every early spring.
然而因为疫情，这个春天从封城一刻起，注定要换一种打开方式。
However, due to the epidemic, this spring from the moment of closure, is doomed to a different way.
贾胜治是为数不多还能自由穿梭在武汉街头的人，作为武汉江岸区黄浦京东物流站的站长，他所在的站点承担了汉口解放大道和发展大道、建设大道交汇区域的的包裹配送。
Jia Shengzhi is one of the few people who can still travel freely through the streets of Wuhan. As the stationmaster of Huangpu Jingdong Logistics Station in Wuhan, his site is responsible for the Hankou Liberation Road and the development of the road, the junction of the distribution of parcels.
从“封城”、“封路”再到“封小区”，除了派件，贾胜治的电话成了“热线”，打电话发消息的，有陌生人、也有老顾客，目的都是一个——麻烦帮帮忙。
From "sealing the city," "sealing the road" to "sealing the community," in addition to sending pieces, Jia Shengzhi's telephone became a "hotline," a telephone message, there are strangers, there are old customers, the purpose is one - please help.
他的手机里，藏着封城后武汉人最真实的生活。
His mobile phone, the most real life after the closure of Wuhan people.
万万没想到，除了防护服他们还急需秋衣秋裤伴随全国各地医疗队的应援，武汉城里多了不少“逆行者”。
Unexpectedly, in addition to protective clothing they are also in urgent need of autumn clothing and autumn pants to accompany medical teams around the country, Wuhan more than a lot of "reverse walkers."
热心的贾胜治，也俨然从快递员变成了医护们的生活“管家”。
The zealous Jia Shengzhi has also become a steward of the lives of the medical staff.
2月19日一大早，刚到站点的贾胜治就接到了内蒙古乌兰察布前旗物流站站长的电话，电话那头自我介绍后，没多寒暄直奔主题——内蒙古援鄂医疗队现在贾胜治的派送辖区内参与救援，急需一批生活物资，尤其是秋衣秋裤。
In the early morning of February 19th, Jia Shengzhi, who had just arrived at the station, received a telephone call from the stationmaster of the former flag logistics station in Ulaanchab, Inner Mongolia.
封城以来，除了派送日常包裹，贾胜治已经协调物流货车，往医院里送了好几趟防护、生活物资，几乎是他离“战场“最近的时候。
Since the closure of the city, in addition to the delivery of daily parcels, Jia Shengzhi has coordinated logistics trucks, sent several times to the hospital protection, supplies, almost from the "battlefield.
他非常清楚一线任务的紧迫，但没想到除了防护用品，前线医务工作者还缺秋衣秋裤。
He was well aware of the urgency of the task at hand, but had no idea that the front-line medical workers were short of autumn trousers, except for protective equipment.
贾胜治放下电话，安顿好站里工作，出门“扫街”。
Jia Shengzhi put down the telephone, settle down to work in the station, go out "sweep the street."
原本繁华的辖区，如今营业的商家寥寥无几，但凡开门的商场、百货、超市，他一个也没放过，最终还是没凑齐物资清单上的60套秋衣秋裤。
Once a bustling district, few businesses are now open, but every store, department store, supermarket, he did not miss a single one, finally did not complete the inventory of 60 sets of autumn clothes autumn trousers.
“这事儿办不成不行。
"It can't be done.
”贾胜治当即决定多条腿走路，立马联系了武汉的京东仓库，确认本地仓内有全部医护人员需要的物资后，贾胜治立马联系了医疗队，指导医生线上下单。
"Jia immediately decided to walk on more than one leg and immediately contacted Wuhan's Jingdong warehouse to confirm that all the medical supplies needed by medical staff were in the local warehouse.
之后再次联系本地仓优先发货，自己的站点加急派送，第二天一大早就把物资送到了医疗队手上。
Then contact the local warehouse priority shipment, their own site to send urgent, the next morning to the early delivery of supplies to the medical team.

物资送到了，他心里的疑惑也解开了。
When the supplies arrived, the doubts in his heart were cleared up.
原来内蒙古援鄂医疗队在出发前一天晚上10点接到任务，时间紧迫来不及准备生活用品。
The original medical team in Inner Mongolia Hubei received the mission at 10: 00 p.m. the night before departure, time is too tight to prepare supplies.
而在密闭的防护服里，贴身衣物经常被汗浸透，且不能带出隔离区，只能一次性使用。
In closed protective clothing, clothing is often saturated with sweat, and can not be taken out of the isolation zone, can only be used once.
60套秋衣秋裤，是6个护士10天的“作战服”。
The 60 sets of fall trousers are the "battle suit" of 6 nurses for 10 days.
听说儿子对接上了援鄂医疗队的大夫，贾胜治的妈妈连夜包了100个饺子冷冻好，连带着一箱苹果，让儿子送给医疗队员们。
I heard that his son to the doctor attached to the medical team in Hubei, Jia Shengzhi's mother packed 100 dumplings overnight frozen, with a box of apples, for his son to give to the medical team.
因为担心护士们吃不上热的，贾胜治还从家带了蒸锅和碗筷，“感谢你们来支援武汉，这些饺子下班饿了可以自己蒸着吃”。
Fearing that the nurses would not eat hot, Jia took the steamer and chopsticks from home. "Thank you for coming to Wuhan.
贾胜治将饺子送给医护人员。
Jia Shengzhi gives dumplings to medical staff.
护士们接过这些东西时，一度哽咽。
The nurses had a lump in their throat when they took over these things.
如今，贾妈妈还不时念叨，“不知道我们南方人包的饺子，大夫们爱不爱吃。
"Now, Jia mother also said from time to time," I do not know we southerners bag dumplings, doctors love to eat.
”送饺子时贾胜治也这样想过，但他总会接一句，“不知道他们还要呆多久，只要他们有需要，我就去跑。
"Jia Shengzhi thought so when he delivered the dumplings, but he would always reply," I don't know how long they will stay, so long as they need me, I will run.
”“下单”在上海，“跑腿”在武汉在帮护士们买秋衣秋裤之前，贾胜治已经接下很多求助，第一个是买酒精。
"Order" In Shanghai, before Wuhan was helping nurses buy autumn clothes and autumn trousers, Jia had already taken many calls for help, the first of which was to buy alcohol.
大年初二，贾胜治接到一通上海的来电。
New Year's Day, Jia Shengzhi received a call from Shanghai.
电话那头的姑娘请他帮忙拦截一个包裹，包裹里是两瓶高度白酒。
The girl on the other end of the line asked him to stop a package that contained two bottles of highly white wine.
原来，姑娘误以为高度白酒可以替代医用酒精，结果酒还没送到武汉父母的家中，白酒的除菌功效就被辟谣了。
Originally, the girl mistakenly thought that the high degree of liquor can replace the medical alcohol, as a result, the wine has not been sent to Wuhan parents' homes, the efficacy of the disinfectant was denied.
处理完拦截后，贾胜治追问了一句，酒精买到了吗？女孩却说高度白酒是她最后的希望，父母在武汉、自己在线上都买不到酒精。
After dealing with the interception, Jia Shengzhi asked if the alcohol had been bought? The girl said that high liquor was her last hope and her parents could not buy alcohol in Wuhan or online.
抱怨过后，姑娘试探着问贾胜治，你可以帮忙买酒精吗？物流站点，快递小哥都在忙碌。
After complaining, the girl tentatively asked Jia Shengzhi, can you help buy alcohol? Logistics sites, express brother are busy.
彼时，因为受疫情影响，贾胜治的物流站点订单量比往年春节翻了一翻，人手却因为假期和封城少了一大半。
At that time, because of the epidemic, Jia Shengzhi's logistics site orders than the Spring Festival more than double the number of years, hands due to holidays and the closure of the city less than half.
全站11个派送员，每天最长工作将近12个小时，才勉强派完不断涌进站点的包裹。
Eleven dispatchers work nearly 12 hours a day to scrape through a steady stream of parcels into the site.
但贾胜治在电话里没多犹豫，应下了姑娘的请求。
But Jia Shengzhi did not hesitate on the phone, responded to the girl's request.
想着派送辖区有三家大型医院，周边药店也不少，一家一家问过去，总该有存货。
Want to send to the jurisdiction of three large hospitals, the surrounding pharmacies are not a few, one by one asked over, always should have stock.
没想到，当时酒精已经成了“硬通货”，一大半药店已经挂出“酒精已售罄”的牌子，没挂牌的也都缺货。
Unexpectedly, by then alcohol had become "hard currency," more than half of pharmacies have been hanging out "alcohol sold out" brand, not listed are also out of stock.
跑遍辖区都没找到酒精的贾胜治有些不甘心，想起封城后武汉各站点自发建的微信群。
Run all over the district have not found alcohol Jia Shengzhi some reluctant to think of the post-Wuhan site after the establishment of the micro-faith groups.
发出了“义务跑腿”的第一个互助请求：“麻烦各辖区兄弟路过药店，帮买采购两瓶酒精，客户急用。
Issued the "obligation to run errands" the first request for mutual assistance: "Please each jurisdiction brothers pass by the pharmacy, help purchase two bottles of alcohol, the customer emergency use.
”最终，另一个站点的同事买到了一家药店里最后2瓶酒精，贾胜治接过酒精一刻没耽误，送到了姑娘的指定地址。
Eventually, a colleague at another site bought the last two bottles of alcohol from a drugstore, and Jia took it without delay and delivered it to the girl's designated address.
贾胜治发出互助请求的微信群，也成了日后武汉京东小哥们“义务跑腿”的重要工具，消息也越来越密集。
Jia Shengzhi issued a request for mutual assistance micro-group, has also become Wuhan Jingdong small friends "volunteer errands" important tools, the news is more and more intensive.

送的是救命药，不跑不成随着封城天数增加，贾胜治接到的求助越来越多，需求也各不相同。
Send is life-saving medicine, do not run as the number of days closure, Jia Shengzhi received more and more help, needs are also different.
但在所有求助中，送药始终排在贾胜治待办事项的第一位。
But in all help, the delivery of medicine always ranked in the top of the list of things to do.
二月中，贾胜治接到了一位老顾客的电话，请他救救自己的父亲。
In mid-February, Jia received a call from an old customer asking him to save his father.
原来老顾客的父亲患有严重的高血压，每天必须服药，现在药瓶眼看就要见底。
The old client's father, who had severe hypertension and had to take medication every day, was about to reach the bottom of the bottle.
因为药店进货困难，慢性病药当时比较紧缺，老顾客好不容易联系一家药店买到两瓶降压药。
Because drugstores were having trouble getting in, chronic medicine was in short supply, and old customers had trouble contacting a pharmacy to buy two bottles of antihypertensive drugs.
却因为自己家和父亲家的小区封闭，根本拿不到药。
But because his family and his father's small area closed, no access to medicine.
贾胜治骑着电动车为居民买药。
Jia Shengzhi rides an electric car to buy medicine for residents.
老顾客的要求不多，请贾胜治帮忙去药店取药，通过京东物流寄给父亲。
Old customer demand is not much, ask Jia Shengzhi to help the pharmacy to get medicine, through Jingdong Logistics sent to his father.
拿到药店和顾客父亲家的地址后，贾胜治决定自己跑一趟。
After getting the drugstore and the address of the customer's father, Jia decided to take a trip by himself.
一来老人吃药要紧，二来药店和老人家离站点只有几公里，邮寄反倒耽误时间。
On the one hand old people take medicine important, second to the drugstore and old people only a few kilometers from the site, mailing time is wasted.
当天，贾胜治就把降压药送到了老人手中。
That day, Jia Shengzhi on the pressure-relief drugs into the hands of the elderly.
然而，送药的过程并非总是顺利。
However, the delivery process has not always been smooth.
半个月前，同样是一位老顾客找到贾胜治，请他为家里的糖尿病人送胰岛素，虽然病人所在的黄陂区里贾胜治的站点有30多公里，但封城后的武汉路况极佳，距离不是问题。
Half a month ago, the same old customer approached Jia Shengzhi and asked him to deliver insulin to his diabetic family. Although the site of Lijishengzhi of Huangpi District of Huangpi District was more than 30 kilometers away, the road behind the cordon was excellent.
第二天一早，贾胜治特意开了自己家的车去送药，眼看就要进入黄陂区，却因为没有通行证被拦了下来。
The next morning, Jia Shengzhi drove his own car to deliver medicine. He was about to enter Huangpi District, but he was stopped without a permit.
私家车走不了，贾胜治想到了京东的物流货车，立马联络了当班的传站车司机，请他把胰岛素带进黄陂区，送到病人手上。
The private car could not go, Jia Shengzhi thought of the logistics truck in Jingdong, and immediately contacted the station driver on duty, asking him to take insulin to Huangpi District and deliver it to the patient.
遗憾的是，京东物流货车也被拦在了黄陂区外，胰岛素只能原路退回到老顾客手中。
Unfortunately, Pi District of Huangpi District has blocked the truck, and the insulin can only be returned to the old customers.
“换到现在，我肯定能办成。
I am sure I can make it now.
“贾胜治说，现在京东物流车已经拿到运输通行证，在武汉各区域火速驰援一线。
"Jia Shengzhi said that now Jingdong logistics vehicles have been issued with transport passes, in Wuhan, the regions rushed to the rescue line.
好在，胰岛素最后通过志愿者及时送到了病人手中。
Fortunately, insulin finally reached the patient in time through volunteers.
这件事也给了贾胜治启发。
This matter also gave Jia Shengzhi inspiration.
上周，贾胜治和自己“跑腿“微信群里的20多个兄弟们，报名参加了“志愿服务关爱行动”。
Last week, Jia and more than 20 brothers from his running errands microphone group signed up for Volunteer Action.
他们相信，只要有人在奔跑，封城的武汉就不会停下来。
They believe that as long as someone is running, the city of Wuhan will not stop.
至于疫情过后的日子，贾胜治说：“我想先好好睡两天 ”。
As for the days after the outbreak, Jia said: "I want to have a good sleep for two days."
