她反复确认我们工作人员的身份，就是不提供自己的信息，打了几次后来就不接了。
She repeatedly confirmed the identity of our staff members by not providing their own information, making several calls and then dismissing them.
口述 |郭翔整理 |王仲昀我是上海市疾控中心的一名工作人员，原来在免疫规划所工作。
Wang Zhongyun, a staff member at Shanghai CDC, used to work at the immunization program.
新冠肺炎暴发后，中心成立了“追踪办”，我和另外23位同事从其他部门被紧急抽调过来。
After the outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia, the center set up the Tracking Office, and 23 other colleagues and I were transferred from other departments on an emergency basis.
国家卫健委此前发布《新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎防控方案》， 对“密切接触者”这一群体有了明确的管理方案，我们的“追踪办”就是为了落实这个方案。
The National Fitness and Health Commission has announced the "New Coronavirus Infection Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program," the "close contacts" this group has a clear management programme, our "Tracking Office" is to implement the programme.
虽然有很多密切接触者可以通过对病例的流行病学调查直接问询，但对于同乘交通工具，特别是飞机、铁路旅客列车、客运汽车、客运轮船这些大型交通工具的密切接触者，就需要“追踪办”来找人，及早排查确认落实防控措施。
While there are many close contacts that can be made directly through epidemiological investigations of cases, close contacts with large means of transport, in particular aircraft, passenger trains, passenger cars and passenger ships, require "tracking offices" to locate people and identify and implement prevention and control measures at an early stage.
做好“密切接触者”的防控，是当前有效控制疫情扩散非常重要的一环。
It is very important to do a good job in controlling the spread of the epidemic.
我所在的上海市疾控中心“追踪办”目前设有三组，每组八个人。
My Shanghai CDC Tracking Office currently has three groups of eight people each.
我们工作组成立于1月26日，经过一天的紧急培训后于1月27日正式工作。
Our working group was established on 26 January and officially opened on 27 January after a day of emergency training.
既然是“追踪办”，那么重点肯定在于“追踪”。
Since it is a "tracker," the emphasis must be on "tracing."
我们要做的，并不是去确定谁是“密切接触者”，也不是挨家挨户地去找这些“密切接触者”。
What we need to do is not to identify "close contacts," nor to go door-to-door to these "close contacts."
我们的角色，是“密切接触者”的管理环节中的“桥梁”。
Our role is a "bridge" in the management of "close contacts."
当前应对疫情，强调“联防联控”。
The current response to the epidemic, the emphasis is on "joint control."
流行病学调查人员收集确诊病例的经历之后，再筛选出发病后乘坐交通工具（飞机、火车、客运汽车与轮船）的对象及其乘坐的航班号或车次信息，并将其中需要排查的航班号或车次信息告诉我们。
Epidemiological investigators, after collecting the experience of confirmed cases, screen out the object of the means of transport (aircraft, train, passenger car and ship) and the flight number or number of the vehicle in which it is carried, and informs us of the flight number or number of the train to be searched.
得到信息后，我们提请公安部门根据旅客实名登记信息将同天同乘该航班号或车次的人员检索出来，然后通过大数据，尽可能查找到这些密切接触者的联系方式。
After receiving the information, we ask the public security department to search the contact details of these close contacts by using the big data after searching the same day with the person on the flight number or train number according to the passenger's real name registration information.
我们根据公安反馈的个人信息，准确地找到他们，并和他们取得联系。
We accurately located them and contacted them on the basis of personal information received from the police.
对于“密切接触者”的管理，首先最重要的也是统一的原则，是让他们每个人居家隔离14天。
The first and most important principle of "close contact" management is to keep each of them in isolation for 14 days.
从我们得到的信息来看，有些人并不是住在上海的，他可能只是经过上海时和病人同乘坐交通工具。
From the information we have received, some people do not live in Shanghai, but they may only travel with their patients when they pass through Shanghai.
对于已经去往外地的“密切接触者”，我们会给他目前所在地的省级疾控中心发函，并提供协查对象的信息，要求他们进行后续的追踪管理。
For "close contacts" who have gone overseas, we will send a letter to the provincial CDC where he is currently based and provide information about the people he is collaborating with and ask them for follow-up management.
同样地，我们也会收到其他省市疾控中心的来函，因为有些“密切接触者”经过当地的排查发现目前在沪。
Similarly, we will receive letters from other provincial and municipal CDC because some of the "close contacts" have been identified locally in Shanghai.
至于上海本地的“密切接触者”，我们在和他们联系之后，首先比对公安提供的住址信息与他们进行核验，在进行必要的告知后，及时把他们的信息通过各区疾控中心给到对应街道（镇）。
As for the local "close contacts" in Shanghai, after contacting them, we check with them first against the address information provided by the public security authorities, and then send their information to the corresponding streets (towns) through the CDC in each district in time after the necessary information is given.
现在密切接触者管理都是网格化管理，我们要做的是告诉这些群众他们是“密切接触者”，务必做到居家或集中医学观察。
Now that close contact management is grid management, all we have to do is tell these people that they are "in close contact" and make sure to stay at home or focus on medical observation.
而具体的医学观察措施，包括每日两次体温测量，这些都是由他所在街道（镇）去落实。
Specific medical observations, including two daily temperature measurements, were carried out by his street (town).
我们“追踪办”的工作，主要依靠打电话完成，看上去好像没什么难度，但实际上也不简单。
We "track down" the work, relying mainly on the telephone, seems not difficult, but in fact is not simple.
我们和每一个“密切接触者”取得联系后，确认信息是首要任务，然后按照规定对他们进行政策告知，表明身份与利害分析取得对方信任理解，消除因为可能接触病例造成的心理紧张，还要消除他们对后续14天医学观察的抵触情绪，既要舒缓对方焦虑紧张的心情，还要给到一些自我健康观察的建议。
After contacting every "close contact," we confirm that the message is a priority, and then provide them with the required policy to demonstrate trust and understanding, eliminate the psychological stress caused by possible exposures, and overcome their resistance to follow-up 14 days of medical observation, as well as some advice on self-health observation.
这样交流下来，如果联系对象配合的话，一个电话一般5分钟左右。
This communication down, if the contact with the object of cooperation, a telephone call generally about five minutes.
但并非所有交流都能很顺畅。
But not all communication goes smoothly.
如果第一次打电话联系不到人，我们会间隔一段时间再继续拨打电话，这样一天有可能从早联系到晚，但最终还是无人接听；还有时候好不容易联系上了，话没说两句就被对方挂电话；有时候对方扔下一句“请不要骚扰我”，然后就被拉黑。
If we don't get people on the first call, we'll call again at regular intervals, so that one day there may be no one to answer the phone. Sometimes we can get in touch and hang up without saying a word.
记得有次联系一位女士，她反复确认我们工作人员的身份，就是不提供自己的信息，打了几次后来就不接了。
I remember contacting a woman who repeatedly confirmed the identity of our staff, but did not provide her own information, made several calls and then did not answer.
后来在拨打另一个密切接触者时发现原来是一家人，那位女士再接电话时说，之前担心是骚扰电话。
Later, when she called another close contact and found it was a family, the woman answered the phone, saying she had been worried about harassing calls.
还有几次碰到几位年纪大点的阿姨，接到我们的告知电话后反复要求我们工作人员不要通知街道，怕被邻居知道自己是密切接触者。
There were also a few cases of older aunts who, after receiving our calls, repeatedly asked our staff not to notify the street for fear of being known by our neighbours as close contacts.
这样的心情我们理解，但政策与规定在那里，疫情当前我们必须服从大局，我们要反反复复地解释。
We understand that sentiment, but the policies and regulations are there, the epidemic must now be subordinated to the bigger picture, and we have to explain it again and again.
林林总总，各种情绪都碰到过。
All sorts of emotions have been touched.
但是我们在拨打下一个号码前，都会平复心情，以平和舒缓的语气开始下一段通话。
But before we dial the next number, we'll calm down and start the next conversation in a calm, soothing tone.
这些天从早忙到晚，有几次一直忙到凌晨才结束。
These days from early to late, several times until the end of the morning busy.
工作组成立之初，每天8个人至少要打五六百个电话。
At the beginning of the team, eight people made at least five or six hundred calls a day.
这几天工作量有所减少，每天也有差不多二三百个电话。
The workload has decreased over the last few days and there are almost two or three hundred calls a day.
现在返沪高峰来了，如果疫情仍持续，预计后续我们的工作量又会变大。
Now back to the peak of Shanghai, if the epidemic continues, we are expected to follow up our workload will become larger.
虹桥站对到达旅客逐个进行测温其实，在我们工作过程中，大多数公众在被我们通知时都表示理解，这令人欣慰。
Hong Qiao Station on the arrival of passengers on a case-by-case temperature measurement in fact, in the course of our work, the majority of the public was informed when we understand, which is gratifying.
有联系的对象主动说：我乘飞机回上海就把自己关在家里，尽量把传播风险降低，这是我的社会责任。
It's my social responsibility to lock myself up at home when I fly back to Shanghai and try to reduce the risk of spreading the disease.
每每听到这样的话，我们真心为广大的市民点赞，其实只要每个人都履行好自己的社会责任、防病义务，按照政府和专家的防控建议切实做到位了，我相信我们很快就能战胜当前的疫情。
I believe we will soon be able to overcome the current epidemic, as long as everyone fulfills his social responsibility and disease prevention obligations and follows the advice of the government and experts on prevention and control.
最后，还是很感谢每一位被我们追踪办“骚扰”的市民，谢谢你们的接听电话，谢谢你们的理解与配合。
Finally, I would like to thank everyone we have been tracking the "harassment" of the citizens, thank you for answering the phone, thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
我们的初心与使命就是保护城市公共卫生，我们来自你们，是你们中的一员。
Our first heart and mission is to protect the city's public health, and we are from you, one of you.
公共卫生不就是让每个小家融合成为大家，大家做好了，小家自然安康幸福。
Public health is not to let each small family into everyone, we do a good job, the natural well-being of the small family.
什么叫“密切接触者”国家卫健委发布《新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎防控方案》中，卫健委提出对疫情蔓延过程中与病例产生关联的“密切接触者”的管理细则。
What is "close contacts" The National Health Commission issued the "New Coronavirus Infection Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program," the Wei Bodyguard Commission proposed to spread the epidemic with the case associated with the "close contacts" of the administrative rules.
目前最新发布的第三版防控方案中，对于密切接触者有如下界定：1与病例接触但未采取有效防护者，如：共同居住、学习、工作，或其他有密切接触的人员，如近距离工作或共用同一教室或与病例在同一所房屋中生活。
The third edition of the Prevention and Control Programme, which is currently in its third edition, defines close contacts as follows: 1. Persons who are in contact with a case but do not provide effective protection, such as living together, studying, working, or other persons in close contact, such as working close together or sharing a classroom or living in the same house as the case.
2诊疗、护理、探视病例的医护人员、家属或其他有类似近距离接触的人员，如到密闭环境中探视病人或停留，同病室的其他患者及其陪护人员。
2 Medical staff, family members or other persons in similar close contact who visit or stay in a closed environment, other patients in the sick room and their companions.
3乘坐同一交通工具并有近距离接触人员，包括在交通工具上照料护理过病人的人员、同行人员（家人、同事、朋友等）、或经调查评估后发现有可能近距离接触病例和感染者的其他乘客和乘务人员。
3 Other passengers and crew members who travel on the same means of transport and have close contact with persons, including persons who have cared for the sick on the means of transport, persons accompanying them (family, colleagues, friends, etc.) or other passengers and crew members whose close contact with the case and infected person is possible as a result of an assessment.
4现场调查人员调查后经评估认为符合其他与密切接触者接触的人员。
4 Persons assessed by the on-site investigators to be in contact with other persons in close contact after investigation.
