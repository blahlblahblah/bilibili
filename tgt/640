开启更有意思的武汉！请点击上方优良better→点击右上角“...” → “设为星标 ”22号下午三点半，记者王菁从武汉站坐上回家的动车，随身携带一个粉色双肩包，和一个二十四寸的棕色行李箱，里面放着iPad，笔记本电脑，换洗衣物，以及准备带回家的年货。
Open a more interesting Wuhan! Click on the top right corner of "..." 22 At 3: 30 pm, reporter Wang Jing gets on the train home from Wuhan Station, carrying a pink shoulder bag, and a 24-inch brown suitcase with iPad, laptop, laundry and New Year's goods ready to take home.
她花两个小时零九分钟坐到河南，然后换大巴回家。
She took two hours and nine minutes to sit in Henan and change buses to go home.
这条路线她走了六年，每年往返数次，没有发生过意外。
She had traveled that route for six years, several times a year, without incident.
这是她原本的计划，但在20号突然加剧的武汉新型肺炎的疫情，让她的行程偏移到另一个轨迹，她选择留在武汉。
This was her original plan, but the sudden increase in Wuhan's new pneumonia on the 20th caused her trip to shift to another track, and she chose to stay in Wuhan.
官方通报的肺炎首例患者，出现在去年12月8日。
The first official case of pneumonia was reported on December 8 last year.
二十二天后，一份署名为武汉卫健委的《关于做好不明原因肺炎救治工作的紧急通知》开始在网上流传，引起了市民抢购板蓝根和口罩的恐慌。
Twenty-two days later, an "Emergency Notice Concerning the Treatment of Unknown Causes of Pneumonia," signed by Wuhan Health Commission, began circulating online, causing panic among the public to snap up Banlangen and face masks.
但第二日发布的通报中，“未发现明显人传人现象”的说法，仅为二十七例的确诊数，以及位于江夏区的中国最高级别病毒实验室p4实验室，让危机看上去似乎不是那么严重，恐慌渐渐平息。
But only 27 confirmed cases of human-to-human transmission were detected, and the p4 laboratory, the country's top virus laboratory in Jiangxia, made the crisis seem less severe and the panic subsided, the report said.
王菁因为工作性质的原因，比普通人接收信息的渠道更多，对于本次新型肺炎，她了解到的情况，比正式通报中严峻。
Wang Jing has more access to information than ordinary people because of the nature of her work, and she knows more about this new form of pneumonia than she did in the formal notice.
出于一些理由，她不能透露自己的信息源，但在1月11日中国国家当局与世卫组织公布病毒基因序列，13日前后陆续有企业研发出病毒试剂盒之前，据她得到的信息，病毒已经“疑似扩散”了。
She was unable to disclose her sources for a number of reasons, but before the Chinese authorities and the WHO released the virus's genetic sequence on January 11, before a virus kit was developed by companies around 13 days ago, she received information that the virus was "suspected to have spread."
距离华南海鲜市场五公里，“家住金银潭的一位居民表示，最近救护车来得有点多”。
Five kilometers from the South China seafood market, "a resident of the gold and silver pool says ambulances have come in a bit lately."
而附近的一些医院，已经出现较多的病患。
In some nearby hospitals, there have been more patients.
但她无法肯定他们是新型肺炎的患者。
But she's not sure they're the new pneumonia patients.
这种被WHO命名为2019-nCoV的新型冠状病毒，根据目前披露的信息，在通常情况下有着比SARS更长的潜伏期，为5-12天。
The new coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV by the WHO, typically has a longer incubation period of 5-12 days than SARS, according to information currently disclosed.
它的部分患者“起病症状轻微，可无发热等临床症状”，因此传播也更隐蔽。
Some of its patients "symptoms of mild onset, but no clinical symptoms such as fever," so transmission is more hidden.
不幸的是，在没有确认病毒可以人传人的头二十天里，据王菁在采访路上的观察，武汉市民只有很少一部分戴了口罩，且多为年轻人。
Unfortunately, in the first 20 days after failing to confirm that the virus could be passed from person to person, Wang Jing observed on his interview that only a small number of Wuhan residents, mostly young people, wore masks.
而一些中老年人，甚至对病毒的情况一无所知。
And some middle-aged and old people even know nothing about the virus.
王菁在12月31日病毒刚通报的时候，备了十五只防霾口罩，在病毒开始爆发时，发现它不能有效隔离，于是在淘宝上花七十三块，又买了二百个可孚外科医疗口罩。
When Wang Jing announced the virus on December 31, 15 haze mask, when the virus began to break out, found it can not be effectively isolated, so spent 73 on Taobao, and bought 200 more Corfu surgical masks.
随着微信群里的消息越来越严重，她打算再加购一批时，淘宝上已经买不到任何医用外科和n95口罩了。
By the time she plans to buy another batch, no medical surgeries or N-95 masks will be available on Taobao, as news grows worse in the microphone community.
她的朋友圈里出现代购口罩的人，口罩的价格也开始节节攀升。
The price of masks began to climb, as did that of people buying them in her circle of friends.
武汉线下的药店，同样被抢购一空。
The drugstores under the Wuhan line were also snapped up.
她家附近的，口罩都售罄了，去的时候正好卖完最后一包。
All her masks were sold out near her home, and she was leaving just in time to sell her last bag.
接着在汉口采访时，药店正好进货，她赶紧以二十元一包的价格拿了五包。
Then in Hankou interview, the drugstore just incoming goods, she hurriedly 20 yuan a pack of five bags.
而她前面的一位大妈，“一口气抓了一大把，十几二十包吧。
And a big mother in front of her, "one big catch, a dozen or so bags.
然后想买酒精棉球，什么七十五度酒精，也没有。
And then want to buy alcohol cotton ball, what seventy-five degrees alcohol, also not.
”第二天她又去了五个药店，才终于买到。
"The next day she went to five more pharmacies before she finally got one.
但购入药品并没有让她心安，记者和医护人员一样，离病毒不远。
But buying medicine did not reassure her, and journalists, like health care workers, are not far from the virus.
在工作群里，她看到同事们交流身体近况，“有三分之一出现头重、咳嗽、肌肉酸和低烧”。
In the work group, she saw colleagues talking about their health. "A third of them have headaches, coughing, muscle acid and low fever.
他们中多数，都会去武汉的各个医院、华南海鲜市场等地，进行实地采访。
Most of them will go to Wuhan hospitals, South China Seafood Market and other places to conduct on-site interviews.
单位给他们发放了3m口罩和增强免疫力的药物。
They were given 3m masks and immune-boosting drugs.
20号，钟南山院士肯定新型肺炎病毒存在人传人现象当天，微博上掀起了一波对武汉的声讨。
No. 20, Academician Zhong Nan Shan confirmed the existence of the new pneumonia virus human-to-human phenomenon, Weibo launched a wave of voices against Wuhan.
王菁“真的很有点害怕了”，她的母亲发了好几条长语音，让她考虑自身的安全，今年委屈一下，留在武汉过年。
Wang Jing "is really a bit afraid," her mother made several long speech, let her consider their own safety, this year aggrieved, stay in Wuhan for the New Year.
她打视频电话哭了一场，和母亲求情，才换来回家过年的同意。
She made a video-phone cry, and her mother begged for permission to return home for the New Year.
然而不到一天后，全国各省像开花一样确诊了上百例新型肺炎，各大航空公司开始对武汉的航班全额退款，她的母亲再一次劝她留在武汉。
Less than a day later, however, hundreds of new cases of pneumonia were diagnosed in provinces across the country, and airlines began to refund Wuhan flights in full, again urging her to stay in Wuhan.
她又哭了一场，这次同意了退票，来回的手续费扣了近五十块。
She cried again, this time agreed to a refund, the round-trip service charge of nearly 50 dollars.
接着在晚上七点，12306对武汉来往的火车，开始免除退票手续费。
Then at 7 pm, 12306 train to and from Wuhan, began to waive the refund fee.
这会是她第一次在武汉过年，也是第一次独自过年。
This will be her first New Year in Wuhan, but also the first time to celebrate New Year alone.
她取消了猫咪的寄养，准备囤一点食物。
She removed the cat from her foster care and prepared to hoard a little food.
她用京东到家买了几大袋泡面，一些蔬菜，五公斤大米和几块蛋糕。
She bought big bags of noodles, some vegetables, five kilograms of rice and some cakes with her home in Jingdong.
第一次下单时，外卖小哥给她电话，说最近订单太多，货物不足，让她第二天早上赶紧买。
The first time I placed an order, my little takeout brother phoned her to say that she had recently ordered too much and was short of goods.
最近使用外卖购买药品的人也很多，药店即便在晚上也排着队。
There has also been a recent wave of take-out drug purchases, with pharmacies lining up even at night.
王菁说了很多次“怕”，她的手有一会儿怕得发抖，她想呆在家里，过年期间不出门了。
Wang Jing said "afraid" many times, her hands trembled for a moment, she wanted to stay at home, during the New Year stay.
但工作群里，她的同事们听到可以去同济医院采访，知道有防护服穿后，自愿报名。
But in the work group, her colleagues heard that she could go to Tongji Hospital to interview, know there are protective clothing after the voluntary registration.
这让她为自己的胆小感到愧疚。
It made her feel guilty for her cowardice.
其实也没什么愧疚的，每个记者都有自己的工作任务。
In fact, there is no guilt, every reporter has their own task.
22号下午，在王菁本该坐上回家的动车的时候，武大中南医院传出用ECMO（移动心肺仪）技术，成功救治一新型冠状病毒肺炎重症患者的消息。
On the afternoon of the 22nd, when Wang Jing was supposed to take the train home, the hospital in Zhongnan successfully treated a new coronavirus pneumonia patient with ECMO technology.
她在家中，有些流鼻涕，先用威猛先生、再用酒精，做了一个多小时厨房的卫生。
She had a runny nose at home, and had been cleaning the kitchen for more than an hour with Mr. Weaver and then with alcohol.
第二天她将去医院采访。
The next day she will go to the hospital.
截止22号晚上，兰州已发现一例新型冠状病毒的疑似病例。
As of the evening of the 22nd Lanzhou has found a new case of suspected coronavirus.
20号早上起床打开手机，李女士看到铺天盖地的疫情新闻，立马下楼在就近药店买了几包医用外科口罩。
When she got up on the morning of the 20th and turned on her mobile phone, Ms. Lee saw a flood of news and immediately went downstairs to buy some bags of medical surgical masks at the nearest drugstore.
大概晚上八点，在各大媒体以及社交平台实时观察疫情后，李女士决定取消21号回武汉过年的机票，她说自己向来都是敏感度很高的人。
At about 8 p. m., Ms. Li decided to cancel her flight back to Wuhan at about 8 p. m., after observing the epidemic in real time on major media and social platforms.
武昌张之洞路家中的父母，在接到女儿过年不回家的消息后，还是难掩失望，但在她努力向父母介绍病情现状之后，最终还是表示理解和支持，“特殊情况这也是没有办法的事，只能等疫情过去再回家。
The parents of Zhang Zhidong Road in Wuchang were disappointed after receiving the news that their daughter would not come home for the New Year. But after she tried to brief her parents on the current situation, they finally expressed their understanding and support.
”虽然身在外地，李女士不停刷新着朋友圈，关心家乡亲人朋友们的动态，她说每看到一篇对病毒详细分析的报道，都会认真阅读，有选择性地转发给家人，然后再视频和父母叮嘱戴口罩的问题，老人嫌憋地难受，出门总是忘了戴，这种漫不经心的不以为意让李女士感到十分头疼。
Although she is away, Ms. Li, who is constantly updating her circle of friends and relatives and caring about developments in her hometown, says Ms. Lee gets a headache when she sees a report on a detailed analysis of the virus, reads it carefully, forwards it selectively to family members, and then video clips and parents telling them to wear a mask.
李女士不能去到父母身边，隔这么远，更多是作为子女对老人的担心，嘱咐又嘱咐。
Ms. Lee can not go to their parents, so far away, more as children to the elderly worry, and charge.
兰州街道上，佩戴口罩的行人越来越多，大家都开始意识到问题的严重性，李女士和自己的家人会尽量减少外出，但必要的饭局还是在照常进行。
Lanzhou streets, more and more people wearing masks, everyone began to realize the seriousness of the problem, Ms. Lee and his family will minimize the need to go out, but the necessary meals are still going on as usual.
昨天下午，李女士还在武汉同学群里收到几个打麻将的视频，她说武汉人心态真是好，但自己对这种疫情非常敏感，“如果我在家，我可能就会去囤蔬菜水果粮食了，然后关在家里，一步也不出去，我可能是非典型性武汉人。
Yesterday afternoon, Ms. Li also received several videos of mahjong playing in Wuhan students' group. She said the Wuhan people were in a good mood, but she was very sensitive about the outbreak.
”大概1月20日之前，在网络上，微信里，她看到了很多无所谓的声音，李女士无法理解这些人的态度。
Around January 20, she saw a lot of indifferent voices on the Internet, in microletters, and Ms. Lee couldn't understand their attitudes.
从这两天开始，感染人数不断上升之后，李女士就再没看到这样的声音了。
Since those two days, when the number of infected people continued to rise, Ms. Lee has not seen such a sound.
疫情变严重后，出入武汉几乎成为电影《釜山行》中的场景，网络上也流传着很多对话截图，其中不乏一些虚假消息。
As the epidemic got worse, access to Wuhan became almost a scene from the movie Busan, and many conversations, including some false ones, circulated on the Internet.
今天封城的消息一出，每个人更加积极地转发着各种新闻报道，并加以评论，李女士也是其中一员。
Ms. Lee was one of the more active reporters relaying news stories and commenting on the news of the city's closure today.
“我还是比较淡定的，哪怕心里其实很着急，恐慌倒没有，但是也不能太无所谓，不能觉得这个事情离自己很远就不做好防护，特别现在人口流动性这么大。
"I am still relatively calm, even if the heart is really very anxious, panic is not, but can not be too indifferent, can not feel that this matter is far from their own protection, especially now that the population is so mobile.
”李女士现在每天最担心的就是在武汉的家人，弟弟也因此留在上海独自过春节，今年家里就剩两老过年。
The reason why my younger brother stayed in Shanghai for the Spring Festival on his own is that she now worries most about her family in Wuhan.
李女士回忆起多年前的那场非典病毒，“当年非典我记得很清楚的，我当时在学校里，封校一个多月没有回家，就是每天看新闻，基本与外界隔绝。
Ms. Lee recalls the SARS virus years ago, "I remember it very well, I was in school, closed the school for more than a month did not go home, it is the daily news, basically cut off from the outside world.
火车站机场人员密集，又是封闭空间，最容易引起传染，所以这次我才决定不回家的。
This time I decided not to go home because the train station was crowded and closed and most susceptible to infection.
”身为化妆师，李女士的工作暂时还未受到影响，倒是一些做餐饮的同学朋友在微信群里聊天时，都表示生意惨淡。
As a makeup artist, Ms. Lee's job hasn't been affected for a while, but some of her fellow diners and friends chatting in a microphone group say business is bleak.
因为疫情，李女士把在酒店定的年饭也退了。
Because of the outbreak, Ms. Li also returned the New Year dinner she had booked at the hotel.
以往春节，李女士家会亲戚之间挨家轮着吃年饭，今年大家也只能在群里视频吃年饭。
In the past Spring Festival, Ms. Li's relatives between the round-the-clock food, this year we can only have a video in the group to eat New Year's dinner.
早上7:15，王雯被公寓外的电车声吵醒，她习惯性打开手机翻看微博。
At 7: 15 a.m. Wang was woken up by the sound of an electric car outside her apartment. She habitually opened her mobile phone and scanned the microblog.
王雯是武汉人，在大阪从事旅游服务工作五年了。
Wang Wen, a native of Wuhan, has been working as a tourist service in Osaka for five years.
从国内#武汉肺炎#形势变得紧张开始，她每天都要拿起手机无数次，刷微博，刷朋友圈，不漏掉任何一个跟“新型肺炎”相关的新闻。
From the domestic # Wuhan pneumonia # situation became tense began, she picked up the phone countless times every day, brush micro-blogging, brush friends circle, do not miss any of the "new pneumonia "-related news.
当看到#武汉机场火车站离汉通道暂时关闭##武汉公交地铁暂停运行#两个热搜时，王雯立刻清醒，她猛地从床上坐起，给在武汉的父母打去电话。
When she saw # Wuhan airport railway station from Han corridor temporarily closed # # Wuhan bus stop operation # 2 Thermal search, Wang Wen immediately woke up from bed and called her parents in Wuhan.
北京时间6:20，父母还在睡梦中，接到王雯的电话时他们有些惊讶，以为是女儿提前回国。
When her parents received a call from Wang Wen while she was asleep at 6: 20 Beijing time, they were astounded that her daughter had left for home early.
当听明白原由后，彼此连问好的时间都没有，挂掉电话，他们准备去楼底下的菜市场再买些东西。
There was no time to say hello. Hang up the phone. They were going down to the Halles Market to buy something more.
虽然家里已经腌好腊鱼腊肉和香肠，炸好肉圆子和藕夹当年货，冰箱里也有饺子和火锅料。
Although the family has salted bacon and sausage, fried meat and lotus root folder of the year goods, there are dumplings and hot pot materials in the refrigerator.
他们觉得这些还不够，一定要再多囤些蔬果青菜和干粮才放心。
They felt that this was not enough. They had to hoard more vegetables, fruits and vegetables and dry food.
疫情让身在异国的王雯放弃回家过年，这不是她第一次不回家过年。
It was not the first time that Wang Wen, who was in a foreign country, had given up celebrating the Chinese New Year.
她喜欢春节的热闹，无奈招架不住父母的唠叨和七大姑八大婆的问候，总会借工作之名躲避春节。
She likes the excitement of the Spring Festival, but helpless parents nagging and Seven Great-aunt's greetings, always use the name of work to avoid the Spring Festival.
今年，王雯的家族群里、朋友群里没有聚餐，也没有拜年。
This year, Wang Wen's family, friends did not have a dinner, nor did a New Year call.
她知道，大家都没心情过节。
She knew that no one was in the mood for the holiday.
春节期间，从中国到日本的游客数量只增不减，王雯的工作还要继续。
During the Spring Festival, the number of tourists from China to Japan only increased, Wang Wen's work will continue.
放下电话后起床准备早餐，肺炎的消息看多了，王雯觉得自己的嗓子也开始有些不舒服。
Put down the phone and get up to prepare breakfast, pneumonia news read too much, Wang Wen felt his throat also began to feel a bit uncomfortable.
看着电视机里新闻轮番播放武汉肺炎的疫情，想着网络上爆炸式的信息，王雯突然大哭起来，她有些想家了。
Watching TV news repeatedly broadcast Wuhan pneumonia epidemic, thinking of the explosive information on the network, Wang suddenly burst into tears, she was a bit homesick.
20日上午11：25，周翔发布了一条朋友圈，呼吁的士司机为了安全佩戴口罩。
At 11: 25 a.m. Zhou Xiang released a group of friends calling on taxi drivers to wear masks for safety reasons.
没过多久，武汉市政府出台红头文件，正式执行在公共场所强制要求佩戴口罩的相关措施。
It wasn't long before the Wuhan city government issued a red-letter document formally enforcing the mandatory wearing of masks in public places.
自从2019年12月31日，武汉市新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情进入公众视野后，网络平台上涌现对武汉人防护意识不足的调侃，攻击。
Since December 31, 2019, Wuhan City, the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic into the public eye, the network platform on the lack of adequate defense awareness of Wuhan ridicule, attacks.
对于身处其中的周翔而言，武汉人的重视程度已经有了明显提升，“宣布后很多市民重视了”。
Zhou Xiang among them, Wuhan people have a significant degree of attention has been raised, "after the announcement many citizens attached importance to."
周翔是湖北宜昌人，目前在武汉从事设计工作，工作地点距离华南海鲜市场只有近六公里，为了安全，在他提议下公司提前放了年假。
Zhou Xiang, a native of Yichang, Hubei, is currently engaged in design work in Wuhan, which is located nearly six kilometers from the South China seafood market.
至于何时恢复工作，一切仍是未知，好在网络时代，许多工作可以远程线上完成。
As for when to get back to work, it's still unknown, but in the cyber age, a lot of work can be done remotely.
“生命高于一切，项目大不了推迟或者不做”。
"Life is above everything, and projects can't be postponed or not done."
疫情严重，周翔并不打算回老家。
The outbreak is so serious that Zhou Xiang is not planning to return home.
留在武汉的他买了六盒普通医用口罩，以及两盒朋友推荐购买的磷酸奥司他韦——一种作用于神经氨酸酶的特异性抑制剂，其抑制神经氨酸酶的作用，曾主要运用于治疗甲型流感和乙型流感。
The man who stayed in Wuhan bought six boxes of common medical masks, as well as two boxes of oseltamivir phosphate, a specific inhibitor of neuroaminase, recommended by two friends for treatment of influenza A and B.
除了这些特殊的“年货”，年夜饭也需要好好准备。
In addition to these special "New Year's Eve" meals also need to be well prepared.
家附近的市场依旧热闹，和往年最大的区别在于人们都戴着口罩，手上提满了东西。
The market around home is still bustling, and the biggest difference from previous years is that people wear masks and carry lots of stuff.
周翔猜测，大家应该都做好了不出门的准备。
Zhou Xiang conjectures, everybody should be ready not to go out.
过年七天，按照进入“隔离状态”的计划，周翔和妻子、丈母娘一家的生活所需要么提前购置妥当，要么依靠外卖进行必要的补给，“反正尽量不出门”。
Seven days into the "isolation" plan, Zhou Xiang and his wife, mother-in-law's life needs to buy well in advance, or rely on take-out for necessary supplies, "try not to go out anyway.
在他的朋友圈里，有人转发起了中药药方，有人担心疫情恶化，也有人发了江汉路地铁站空空荡荡的视频。
In his circle of friends, a Chinese medicine prescription was forwarded, and some feared a worsening of the epidemic, while others sent videos of the empty Jianghan subway station.
焦虑和恐惧，成为了最显见的情绪。
Anxiety and fear are the most visible emotions.
周翔也不乐观，担心新型冠状病毒肺炎的疫情发展，会和2003年的非典型肺炎的发展时间表一样漫长。
Zhou Xiang is also not optimistic, worried that the new coronavirus pneumonia outbreak will be as long as the development schedule of SARS in 2003.
但他还是对政府充满信心，“政府什么时候做什么有很大意义，这是我们制度的优势”。
But he remained confident of the government, saying, "It makes a lot of sense when the government does what. It's the strength of our system."
就在采访结束后不久，人民日报发布了最新消息，湖北省多地发现疑似病例，周翔的老家宜昌也在其中。
Shortly after the interview, the People's Daily published the latest news, Hubei Province found more suspected cases, Zhou Xiang's hometown Yichang among them.
按原本的计划，徐伟会坐上1月23日早上9:40的火车，从武昌站踏上回家的路，但现在他只能在租的房子里，一个人度过2020年的春节。
He was scheduled to take the 9: 40 a.m. train from Wuchang Station on his way home, but now he can only spend the 2020 Spring Festival alone in a rented house.
一开始，对于这场突如其来的疫情徐伟并不在意。
At first, Xu Wei wasn't concerned about the sudden outbreak.
他每天的活动范围仅限于住所和一公里外的公司之间，由于距离汉口较远，新型冠状病毒肺炎的消息似乎并没有对生活造成太大影响。
His daily activities are limited to the home and a kilometer away between the company, due to the distance from Hankou, the news of the new coronavirus pneumonia does not seem to have much impact on life.
身边很多朋友转发关于“不明原因肺炎”的文章，也有不少人提前离汉，这些没能引起他的重视，“我侥幸心里比较重。
Many of his friends forwarded articles on "pneumonia for unknown reasons" and many left Han early, which did not get his attention. "I was lucky to have a big heart.
”直到21日，远在家乡的姐姐突然询问能不能提前请假回家，许多朋友发来注意防护的提醒，看着朋友圈里相关的消息骤然增加，徐伟才意识到情况不对，“路上好多（人）都戴着口罩”。
His sister, who was away in her hometown, suddenly asked if she could take early leave to go home. Many friends alerted her to the safety precautions.
当天下午，由于员工集体申请，公司宣布春节前以在家办公形式工作。
In the afternoon, the company announced that it would work from home before the Spring Festival due to the collective application of employees.
身边的同事大多数依然选择回家，徐伟和姐姐商量过后，考虑到频繁出入火车站可能增加不必要的风险，并且担心传染家人，他决定留在武汉。
Most of his colleagues still chose to go home, and Xu Wei decided to stay in Wuhan after consulting with his sister, considering that frequent trips to the railway station could increase unnecessary risks and worry about infecting his family.
对于儿子的决定，徐伟的母亲有些难以接受，甚至以儿子不回家她就来武汉为要挟。
Xu Wei's mother found it difficult to accept her son's decision and even threatened to come to Wuhan if he did not come home.
在徐伟反复解释下，母亲终于还是理解了这个决定。
After repeated explanations from Xu Wei, his mother finally understood the decision.
“还是比较希望我回去吧，主要是希望我回去了短时间不要再回来。
"I prefer to go back, mainly hope I go back for a short time do not come back.
”不知道是因为年关将至，还是因为这场肺炎，住处附近似乎突然安静了下来，就连汽车的声音都少了很多。
Whether it was the end of the year or the pneumonia, there seemed to be a sudden silence around the house, and even the sound of the car was much less.
徐伟一边说着自己喜欢安静，一边又忍不住感慨自己过得有些悲凉。
Xu Wei said that he liked quiet, and at the same time could not help but lament that he was a little sad.
回家的行程取消了，出门逛逛也不现实，公司到现在也没有发出年后的工作安排，面对突然清闲下来的生活，徐伟一时间有些无措。
The trip home was canceled, it was unrealistic to go out, the company has not issued a new year after the work arrangements, in the face of a sudden idle life, Xu Wei a little at a time.
他的假期计划看起来有些单调：打游戏，学中医理论，做饭。
His holiday plans look monotonous: playing games, learning Chinese medicine theory, cooking.
电脑里的《刺客信条》已经玩腻了，徐伟在朋友圈发了消息，问有没有好的游戏推荐，下面有十几条评论都在提《瘟疫公司》，“说是沉浸式游戏体验”。
"The Assassin's Creed" in the computer has become too much fun. Xu Wei has sent messages to friends asking if there are any good games to recommend. Here are a dozen comments on "The Plague" or "Immersion Game Experience.
几年前徐伟曾经玩过这款游戏，听说有人基于这款游戏做了一个“神预言”mod，他有些好奇，打算研究一番。
Xu Wei, who played the game a few years ago, was intrigued to learn that someone had made a "divine prediction" based on the game.
对于武汉的疫情，徐伟显得非常乐观：那么大的事，全社会自然会认真对待，我们能做的就是保护好自己，并希望这段日子尽快过去。
Xu Wei is very optimistic about the situation in Wuhan. The whole society will take it seriously. All we can do is to protect ourselves and hope that the day will pass quickly.
“我妈说，如果我是晚一天的票，就不让我回来了。
"My mother said that if I had been a day late, I wouldn't have come back.
”已经回到武汉的may，每一天都比前一天更后悔回武汉。
Has returned to Wuhan mayday, every day more than the day before regret back to Wuhan.
早在12月底的时候，may从一条微博里得知“武汉有了不明原因肺炎”。
As early as the end of December, May learned from a microblog that "Wuhan has an unknown cause of pneumonia."
但那条微博的重点，是在介绍“武汉拥有全国唯一一个p4级病毒实验室”，牛逼的家乡让may放宽了心，抢了回家的火车票。
But the focus of the microblog is to introduce that "Wuhan has the only p4 virus lab in the country," the cow-driven hometown let May relax and snatch the train ticket home.
真正察觉武汉的肺炎没有想象中的简单，是在20号。
The real detection of pneumonia in Wuhan is not as simple as imagined, is on the 20th.
广州的药店买不到口罩了，肺炎确诊病例不断增加的新闻铺天盖地，钟南山带队专家组到了武汉，新闻发布会上宣布“肺炎人传人”……may回家的心动摇了，于是发消息给在武汉从医的父母，了解武汉的情况。
Guangzhou pharmacies can not buy masks, confirmed cases of pneumonia is increasing the news, Zhong Nan Shan team of experts to Wuhan, announced that the "pneumonia man-to-person" at a news conference.
“没事，我们连口罩都没带。
"No, we don't even have masks on.
”父母的一句话，让may宽了心。
"Said the parents, let May relax.
21号早上10:40，may在广州南踏上了回武汉的列车。
At 10: 40 a.m. on the 21st, May took the train back to Wuhan in southern Guangzhou.
”列车上80%的乘客都戴着口罩，火车站里50%的人戴着口罩，舅妈在接may回家的途中也只字未提武汉的肺炎。
Eighty percent of the train's passengers were wearing masks and 50 percent of those at the train station were wearing masks.
may一度觉得，是自己过虑了。
For a time, May felt that he was taking it too seriously.
但还是改签了回广州的车票，从初四提前到初二。

这个春节，她原本准备浪过去。
This Spring Festival, she was ready to wave past.
22号，宅了3天的她，退了去西安的火车票，和去重庆的机票，并劝阻还没回武汉的上海朋友，“别回来了！”在家里的这三天，bittersvveeter睁开眼的瞬间，就会开始盘旋三句话：“这将是你往后余生里最年轻的一天”“我希望这是你往后余生里最糟的一天”“如果这是你的最后一天你会怎么过”然后打开手机，查看新增的病例，再看肺炎有无好转的迹象。
She returned her train ticket to Xi'an and her plane ticket to Chongqing, and discouraged Shanghai friends who had not returned to Wuhan from going back to Wuhan. "This will be the youngest day for the rest of your life," she said.

疫情大面积爆发时，罗馨正在距离武汉900多公里外的澳门。

虽然依然按照计划在澳门游玩，但心里没有一刻不在挂念这件事情。
Although still according to the plan to play in Macao, but the mind does not not worry about this matter for a moment.
同行的人中有外地的旅伴因为家乡出现了首例感染而担忧不已，罗馨和朋友看着武汉每天都在不断增加的感染人数只能沉默。

从疫区外回到疫区内，罗馨的真实感受是情况没那么乐观，也没那么糟糕。
