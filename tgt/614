To open a more interesting Wuhan, please click on the top right corner of "..." to "set the star" 19,000, according to the survey conducted by the Hubei Provincial People's Bureau in July 2018, 81% of which are concentrated in Wuhan.
他们时常出没于楚河汉街、光谷步行街、花园道、武大周围、沌口，靠着不流利的中文和学来的几句武汉话，和这片土地上的人们打成一片。
They often haunt Chu He Han Street, Guanggu Pedestrian Street, Garden Road, Wu Da surrounding, illegible mouth, relying on not fluent Chinese and learned a few Wuhan words, and the people of this land into one.
疫情发生后，美国、日本、澳大利亚、德国、法国、英国、斯里兰卡、泰国等国家陆续宣布从武汉撤离本国公民，但是仍有许多外国人选择留在武汉，和武汉一起度过短暂的“黑暗时刻”。
After the outbreak, the United States, Japan, Australia, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Sri Lanka, Thailand and other countries announced the evacuation of their citizens from Wuhan, but still many foreigners chose to stay in Wuhan and spend a brief "dark moment" with Wuhan.
“我爱武汉，因为它是一个充满活力的城市。
"I love Wuhan because it is a vibrant city.
而现在街上空无一人，没有一点噪音，这让我觉得很难过。
Now the streets are empty and silent, which makes me feel very sad.
”在武汉生活了近10年的Fred如是说。
According to Fred, who has lived in Wuhan for nearly a decade.
那些留在武汉的外国人，还好吗？Jake是在武汉的外国人中的一员，也是较为特殊的一个——他曾被评为“武汉最会吃喝玩乐的洋老板”，所创立的“小赞Wuhan”为身处武汉的外国人提供了吃喝玩乐的一系列信息，帮助他们建立起一个社交平台。
He was once named Wuhan's Most Drink, Drink and Drink boss, and founded Wuhan, which provided foreigners in Wuhan with a range of information on eating, drinking and playing, and helped them build a social platform.
在武汉，80%-90%的外国人都是小赞Wuhan的粉丝。
In Wuhan, 80 percent to 90 percent of foreigners are fans of the little Praise Wuhan.
小赞Wuhan的微信小程序早在12月31日，Jake就从一个朋友口中听闻了新冠病毒的消息，和绝大多数人一样，他并未意识到事情的严重性，以为病毒只能直接通过病毒源或者食物感染。
As early as December 31, Jake heard about the new crown virus from a friend. Like most people, he didn't realize the seriousness of the situation.
他相信新闻报道，在当时没有人传人的依据。
He believed in journalism, and there was no basis for it at the time.
直到后来，医院开始传出这种病毒具有传染性的消息，并且国外也开始有确诊病例，而武汉的确诊人数依然维持稳定时，Jake才开始担心这次疫情的严重。
It wasn't until the hospital began to report that the virus was contagious, and when confirmed cases began to emerge from abroad, and the number of confirmed cases in Wuhan remained stable, Jake began to worry about the severity of the outbreak.
在1月13号小赞Wuhan的颁奖典礼上，Jake开始出现低烧的症状，一直持续3天左右才渐渐退烧。
At the Juhan ceremony on Jan. 13, Jake began showing signs of a low-grade fever, which lasted about three days before the fever subsided.
随后，他又开始咳嗽，打喷嚏，流鼻涕和鼻窦感染，几天之内，又陆续出现肌肉酸痛和胸肺疼痛的症状。
He then began coughing, sneezing, runny noses and sinus infections, and within days began to show signs of muscle pain and chest and lung pain.
Jake在小赞Wuhan的颁奖礼他无法确定身体上的症状是否来源于新冠病毒，同时更加担心在现在人满为患的医院环境中，再次被交叉感染。
He wasn't sure whether his physical symptoms were caused by the new crown virus, and he was more concerned about being cross-infected again in the crowded hospital environment.
在护理学硕士母亲的建议下，他把自己隔离起来，尝试服用药物自我治疗，庆幸的是，情况似乎在慢慢好转。
On the advice of his Masters of Nursing mother, he isolated himself and tried to take medication to self-treat. Fortunately, the situation seemed to be slowly improving.
在采访过程中，Jake频繁地用到“worry（担心）”、“nervous（紧张）”、“afraid（害怕）”、“concerns（担忧）”这样的字眼，即使隔着屏幕，依然能感受到他的不安。
During the interview, Jake frequently used the words "worry," "nervous," "fear," "concern," and even across the screen, his uneasiness was felt.
“我不确定自己的病情。
"I'm not sure about my illness.
但是我有一种强烈的感觉，我正是成百上千未经诊断的新冠患者之一。
But I have a strong feeling that I am one of hundreds of undiagnosed new crown patients.
”1月29日，美国从武汉撤侨的包机从武汉天河机场起飞，到达阿拉斯加后又飞往南加州，降落在河滨县空军基地。
The charter flight to evacuate the overseas Chinese from Wuhan took off from Wuhan Tianhe Airport on January 29, arrived in Alaska and flew to Southern California, where it landed at Riverside Air Force Base.
Jake因为没有办法证明身体健康状况而不能获得申请，没有登上这架飞机，他却在当天也前往了机场，为了运送被撤离的好友母女。
Jake couldn't get an application because he couldn't prove his health, so he didn't board the plane. Instead, he went to the airport the same day to transport his evacuated friends, mother and daughter.
Jake送朋友去机场当问到会不会担心交叉感染时，Jake告诉我，99%在武汉的外国人没有自己的车，而领事馆组织的撤离根本没有为他们提供前往机场的交通工具。
When Jake asked if he was worried about cross-infection, he told me that 99 percent of the foreigners in Wuhan didn't have their own cars and that the evacuation of the consulate organization did not provide them with transportation to the airport.
为此，只能他尽可能做了很多预防措施，然后送他们去机场。
To do this, he had to take as many precautions as possible and then take them to the airport.
前一天下午2点他刚刚从光谷接这对母女送到机场，凌晨2点30却得知女孩的护照不在身上，因此被拒绝登机，他又不得不赶往机场将她们接回光谷，直到凌晨5点才到家。
The day before, at 2 p.m., he had just picked up the mother and daughter from the Valley of Light and had been denied access to the plane when he learned that her passport was missing. He had to go to the airport to pick them up until 5 a.m.
采访过程中，他仍然处于待命状态，一旦飞行时间确定，还有几位英国人需要他开车送往机场。
During the interview, he remained on standby and several Britons needed him to drive to the airport once the flight time was set.
虽然还身处焦虑和恐慌之中，Jake已经在试着调整心态，找到更好的状态。
Though still in a state of anxiety and panic, Jake is already trying to adjust to a better situation.
他开始第一次尝试做中国菜，虽然这比西餐花费他更多时间，却能让他获得平和。
He began his first attempt at making Chinese food, which took him more time than western food, but it brought him peace.
Jake做的虎皮青椒等疫情结束后，Jake想去见见自己的母亲，也许会尝试用新技能为她煮一些中国菜，然后告诉她自己有多爱她。
After Jake has finished cooking tiger skin and green peppers, Jake wants to meet his mother. Maybe he'll try new skills to cook some Chinese food for her, and tell her how much he loves her.
法国人Fred就生活在疫情最严重的汉口，黎黄陂路附近。
Frenchman Fred lives in Hankou, near Li Huangpi Road, where the epidemic is most serious.
Fred今年是Fred在武汉生活的第十年。
Fred will be in Wuhan this year for the tenth year.
他和妻子相识于一场party，天生浪漫而热爱艺术的Fred与音乐作曲出身的武汉女孩Vicky一见钟情，两人相爱，共同创立了服装品牌FuFu，在黎黄陂路珞珈山街开了一家小店，提供咖啡甜点，售卖自己设计以及法国独家代理的衣服。
He and his wife met Vicky, a Wuhan girl who was born a romantic and art-loving artist who wrote music at first sight. They fell in love and co-founded the clothing brand FuFu, which opened a small shop on Lopi's Loppi Street and sold coffee desserts, as well as clothes from its own design and exclusive agency in France.
Fred和妻子Vicky位于黎黄陂路的FuFu Store大约在1月15号左右，Fred就窥见这场疫情的凶猛程度，他给店员们发放了口罩，并叮嘱他们做好清洁和卫生措施。
Fred and his wife, Vicky, at FuFu Store on Li Huangpi Road around January 15, saw how fierce the outbreak was. He distributed masks to shop assistants and told them to take precautions for cleanliness and hygiene.
1月20日，因为疫情的进一步蔓延，Fred关闭了店铺，暂时歇业。
On 20 January, Fred closed his shop and temporarily closed down due to the further spread of the epidemic.
2月1日上午，法国领事馆组织了200多人从武汉撤离，他们通知了Fred，但Fred却选择留在武汉。
On the morning of February 1, the French consulate evacuated more than 200 people from Wuhan. Fred was notified, but Fred chose to stay in Wuhan.
在武汉生活了近十年，Fred觉得自己就是一个武汉人。
After living in Wuhan for nearly ten years, Fred felt like a Wuhan man.
于是他决定留下来，与这艘带他远航发现新世界的船一起渡过难关。
So he decided to stay and tide over the difficulties with the ship that had brought him far into the new world.
每天，Fred还是会戴上口罩、手套和眼镜，跳上自行车来往于工作室与家之间，继续完成设计作品，但在这期间，不会再和任何人接触。
Every day Fred would still wear masks, gloves and glasses, hop on his bike and ride between the studio and home, working on the project, but during that time, he would never touch anyone again.
工作中的Fred疫情之后，Fred常常感受到孤独。
Fred often feels lonely after Fred at work.
几百万人生活在同一座城市却各自隔绝的现状令他沮丧，他渴望与人见面，甚至渴望在武汉的街头和大家一起跳舞。
He was dismayed by the fact that millions of people lived in the same city and were isolated from each other. He longed to meet people and even dance with them on the streets of Wuhan.
幸运的是，妻子和一岁的儿子都在他身边。
Fortunately, his wife and one-year-old son were with him.
在家里的这些日子，他有更多时间和孩子一起玩，做一些法国菜，在下午享受一杯咖啡。
At home, he has more time to play with his children, cook some French food and enjoy a cup of coffee in the afternoon.
Fred说，法国国内也开始恐慌，政府甚至开通了专线来帮助人们解答新冠病毒的相关问题，有些人会问一些很可笑的问题，比如：我吃了中国菜会被感染吗？我从中国收到包裹，可以安全打开吗？相反，身处武汉的他显得更加冷静：“中国政府为此做出了所有最好的决定，我有信心。
Fred said there was also panic in France, with the government even opening a special line to help answer questions about the new crown virus, and some people asking silly questions like: Am I infected when I eat Chinese food? Can I safely open a package from China?
”美国人Roger第一次来武汉还要追溯到1994年，他曾在百威的武汉啤酒厂工作，负责包括武汉啤酒厂在内的国际项目，每年都要到中国出差。
"The first visit to Wuhan by an American dates back to 1994, when he worked at the Wuhan Beer Brewery in Budweiser, where he was in charge of international projects, including the Wuhan Beer Brewery, which travels to China every year.
Roger在武汉认识了许多朋友，武汉让他感觉很放松。

2008年退休后，Roger移居武汉，并开始他的中国和亚洲环游。
After retiring in 2008, Roger moved to Wuhan and began a tour of China and Asia.
Roger截止目前，美国共从武汉撤离201人，而据统计，在武汉的美国人约有1000人——仍然有几百位美国人留在武汉。
Wuhan, where 201 Americans have been evacuated, is still home to hundreds of Americans, according to figures.
1月19日，Roger和妻子从美国度假回来后三天，武汉封城。
Three days after Roger and his wife returned from a vacation in the United States, Wuhan closed the city on January 19.
Roger的妻子放心不下父母，不愿意离开武汉，为了让妻子安心，Roger选择留在武汉，陪在她身边。
Roger's wife was worried about her parents and didn't want to leave Wuhan. To reassure her, Roger chose to stay with her in Wuhan.
封城后，Roger拍下的武汉Roger喜欢春节，自从和中国妻子结婚以来，每年除夕他们都会在妻子的父母家一起吃年夜饭，并在春节之后和妻子一起去国内或者亚洲其它地方旅行。
Wuhan Roger, pictured by Roger, loves Spring Festival and has been dining with his wife's parents on New Year's Eve every year since his wife's marriage, and traveling with his wife to China or other parts of Asia after the Spring Festival.
今年他们依旧在除夕拜访了妻子的父母，但春节后的越南行计划却不得不取消。
They still visited their wife's parents on New Year's Eve this year, but plans for a trip to Vietnam after the Spring Festival had to be canceled.
除了出门买需要的食物和探望妻子的父母外，他们再没有出门。
They never went out except to go out and buy the food they needed and to see their wife's parents.
Roger说，他很害怕与人接触。
Roger said he was afraid of meeting people.
准备出门的Roger待在家里的日子，Roger每天看书，锻炼，看新闻和以前的电视节目，他有些紧张，但总体还保持乐观。
Roger was nervous about the days he spent at home, reading books, exercising, watching the news and the old TV shows, but he was generally optimistic.
“病毒一定会被打败，等疫情过去，我想离开武汉转一转，也许去科罗拉多州远足或者滑雪。
"The virus is sure to be defeated, and when the epidemic is over, I want to leave Wuhan and maybe go hiking or skiing in Colorado.
”72岁的岛田孝治也留在武汉。
The 72-year-old also stayed in Wuhan.
2010年他来到武汉，在华师文化街开了“顶屋咖喱”，在学生之间颇有名气。
In 2010, he came to Wuhan and opened a "top curry" in Hua Shi Cultural Street, which is well known among students.
华师文化街拆迁后，顶屋咖喱又分别在街道口和东湖村开了新店。
After the demolition of Hua Shi Cultural Street, the top curry in the street corner and Donghu village opened new shops.
岛田孝治岛田对于疫情的感知并不强烈，他不懂中文，也没有上网，对于疫情的全部信息都来自顶屋的店长丹子。
Shimada's perception of the epidemic is not strong, he does not understand Chinese, there is no Internet access, all the information about the epidemic from the roof of the shop Dan.
但丹子怕岛田担心，并没有透露太多，只是告知他注意事项，让他尽量不要出门。
But Dan Tzu afraid of the island Tian worried, did not disclose too much, just told him precautions, let him try not to go out.
疫情初期，岛田接受了几家媒体采访，1月23号之后，由于对新冠病毒的复杂情况摸不清，为了不制造谣言造成恐慌，岛田拒绝了后续日本媒体的采访邀请。
In an interview with several media outlets early in the epidemic, Shimada declined an invitation to follow-up Japanese media after Jan. 23 because of confusion about the complexities of the new crown virus and fear of rumors.
对于岛田来说，武汉是他的第二故乡，这里和他的出生地福冈很像，人们性格都很爽朗，气候也类似，这让他感觉回到了青年时代。
For Taeda, Wuhan is his second home, much like Fukuoka, his birthplace, where he was born. He felt like a young man with cheerful personalities and a similar climate.
除了必须回日本办签证的情况，每年岛田都在丹子家过年，疫情爆发后，岛田也并没有回到日本的想法：“武汉也是我的故乡，没有必要回日本。
Every year, in addition to having to return to Japan for a visa, Taeda does not return to Japan for the New Year after the outbreak of the disease: "Wuhan is my hometown, there is no need to go back to Japan.
”日本福冈在武汉的这些日子，岛田过着和往常差不多的生活，他依然每天看书写字，也会和大家一起摘菜。
During his time in Wuhan, Japan, Shimadao lived a similar life as usual, still reading and writing every day and picking vegetables with everyone.
每天都有好吃的家常菜，这让他觉得很幸福。
Every day there was a delicious home-cooked meal, which made him happy.
岛田和大家一起在农田疫情后顶屋咖喱暂时歇业，但因为平时卫生就做得很好，丹子也正在学习消毒，岛田并不太担心顶屋以后的状况。
Shimada joined others in a temporary closure of the roof curry after an outbreak of farmland, but because hygiene is good and Dan is learning to disinfect, Taeda is less worried about the future of the roof.
对于武汉，对于突然的疫情，岛田都显得很乐观。
Wuhan, for the sudden outbreak of the epidemic, the island seems very optimistic.
“武汉的大家都很努力，我相信一定会好起来的。
"Wuhan people are very hard-working, I believe that will be better.
武汉加油。
Wuhan refuels.
”各国撤离进行中，仍有大批外国人留在武汉，Fred也告诉我，他在武汉的绝大多数朋友都决定留下。
While countries were withdrawing, large numbers of foreigners remained in Wuhan, and Fred told me that most of his friends in Wuhan had decided to stay.
这一刻，这些来自不同国家、有着不同面孔的外国人，正和900多万武汉人一起，在这座城市的一扇扇紧闭的门里等待着，等待疫情过后武汉重见天日的那一天。
At this moment, foreigners of different nationalities and faces, together with more than 9 million Wuhan people, are waiting in a closed door of the city, waiting for the day when Wuhan will see the light of day after the outbreak.
