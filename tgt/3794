连日来各地发生多起境外输入病例被立案调查事件，在什么情况下，境外输入病例会被立案调查？最高人民法院、公安部等五部门联合发文明确隐瞒疫情等六类行为将被定罪文|《财经》记者黄姝静俞琴王丽娜实习生刘梓桐编辑|鲁伟截至3月15日24时，中国累计报告境外输入确诊病例123例。
In the past few days, many cases of import from overseas have been registered and investigated. Under what circumstances will such cases be registered and investigated? The Supreme People's Court and the Ministry of Public Security jointly issued a joint letter clearly concealing the epidemic situation.
与此同时，多地都在严防疫情“倒灌”，全国已有多起境外输入病例被有关部门立案调查。
At the same time, many countries are strictly in the "reverse irrigation" epidemic, the country has a number of cases of foreign imports have been registered by the relevant departments for investigation.
据《财经》记者不完全统计，截至3月16日，北京、浙江、河南、甘肃、宁夏5地已通报6起“境外输入新冠肺炎确诊病例被立案调查”事件，至少涉及15名入境人员。
As of March 16, Beijing, Zhejiang, Henan, Gansu and Ningxia had notified six cases of "confirmed cases of newly-diagnosed pneumonia imported from abroad being investigated," involving at least 15 people, according to Caijing.
上述确诊病例涉及的人员之外，与之密切接触者的数量更为庞大——在宁夏首例被立案调查的境外输入病例中，截至2月27日，已发现189名密切接触者。
In addition to the people involved in these confirmed cases, the number of people in close contact with them is even larger - 189 close contacts have been found as of February 27 in Ningxia's first registered case of foreign imports.
3月15日，在北京市新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情防控工作新闻发布会上，北京市政府副秘书长陈蓓称，境外输入已经成为北京市疫情防控的主要风险，境外输入病例也成为北京市新增确诊病例的主体。
On March 15, 2007, at a press conference on the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia in Beijing, Chen Be, deputy secretary-general of the Beijing Municipal Government, said that foreign imports had become the main risk factor for the prevention and control of the epidemic.
为有效防范境外疫情的输入和扩散，首都联防联控协调机制将采取更加严密有力的措施。
In order to effectively prevent the importation and spread of the epidemic abroad, the Joint Prevention and Coordination Mechanism in the capital will take more stringent measures.
《财经》记者发现，上述6起被立案调查的境外输入病例，均涉及瞒报行为，具体分为两类：一是，入境时未按规定如实申报健康状况；二是，回国后未按规定向居住地相关机构或社区报备。
The Caijing reporter found that the above-mentioned six imported cases were all related to acts of concealment, which are divided into two categories: one is the failure to report the true state of health at the time of entry and the other is the failure to report to the relevant agencies or communities of residence as required upon their return.
这15人主要涉嫌违反《刑法》《国境卫生检疫法》。
The 15 were mainly suspected of violating the Criminal Code, the Frontier Sanitary and Quarantine Act.
他们所涉罪名并不完全一致，有的涉嫌妨害传染病防治罪被立案，有的是涉嫌妨害国境卫生检疫罪被立案。
Some of them are suspected of obstructing the prevention and control of infectious diseases and some of them are suspected of obstructing the health and quarantine of the frontier.
当前疫情防控正处在关键期，哪些行为将被定罪处罚？3月16日，最高人民法院、最高人民检察院、公安部、司法部、海关总署联合发布《关于进一步加强国境卫生检疫工作，依法惩治妨害国境卫生检疫违法犯罪的意见》（下称《意见》），回应了近期备受关注的境外输入病例中的涉罪问题，明确隐瞒疫情等六大类行为将被定罪。
On March 16, the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Justice and the General Administration of Customs jointly issued the Opinions on Further Strengthening Frontier Health and Quarantine and Punishing Illegal Violations of Frontier Health and Quarantine according to Law (hereinafter referred to as the Opinions).
北京市炜衡律师事务所律师周浩告诉《财经》记者，《传染病防治法》和《国境卫生检疫法》均对隐瞒疫情等违法行为有针对性的规制条款，在适用时确实存在选择问题。
Zhou Hao, a lawyer at Beijing's Wei Heng Law Office, told Caijing that both the Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Law and the Frontier Health and Quarantine Law have specific regulations on concealing epidemic diseases and other illegal activities.
因此会存在不同部门，面对相似违法情形，适用不同法律的情况。
As a result, there are different sectors where different laws apply in the face of similar violations.
“妨害传染病防治罪和妨害国境卫生检疫罪，两者的重要区别在于量刑。
"The important difference between the crime of obstructing the prevention and control of infectious diseases and that of obstructing the health and quarantine of frontiers lies in sentencing.
前者存在量刑区间，三年以下或三年以上七年以下，后者为三年以下。
The former has a sentencing range of less than three years or more than three years and less than seven years, and the latter less than three years.
六起境外输入病例被立案调查，为什么？境外输入病例被立案调查的案例越来越多，公众普遍关注的是，在什么情况下，境外输入病例会被立案调查？3月4日，廖某君、廖某海等两家一行8人，自意大利乘机抵达北京首都国际机场。
Six overseas import cases have been registered for investigation, why? The number of cases registered for investigation abroad is increasing. The general public is concerned about the circumstances under which such cases will be registered for investigation. On March 4, eight people from two families, Liao and Liao, arrived at Beijing's Capital International Airport by air from Italy.
其中，4人被确诊为新冠肺炎病例。
Of these, four were diagnosed with New Crown Pneumonia.
据北京警方通报，廖某君和廖某海是姐弟关系，两家人长期在意大利经商。
According to Beijing police, Liao and Liao are brother-in-law relationship, the two families in Italy for a long time to do business.
2月下旬以来，廖某君、廖某海相继出现发热、干咳等症状，在登机前使用药物退烧降温。
Since late February, Liao Liao Prince, Liao a sea successively appear fever, dry cough and other symptoms, before boarding the use of drugs to reduce fever.
此外，家庭成员中，有人未如实填写《中华人民共和国出/入境健康申明卡》，“给同机人员造成传染风险”。
In addition, some family members fail to fill out the "Health Declaration Card of the People's Republic of China" truthfully, "thus posing a risk of infection to the crew."
3月6日，顺义公安分局以廖某君等人涉嫌妨害传染病防治罪，依法开展立案侦查。
March 6, Shunyi Public Security Bureau Liao Liao and others suspected of obstructing the prevention and control of infectious diseases, according to law opened investigation.
这是《财经》记者通过公开信息检索，发现的较早的境外输入病例被立案调查案例。
This is the "Caijing" reporter through the public information retrieval, discovered earlier overseas import cases were registered for investigation.
据《财经》记者不完全统计，目前共有6起境外输入病例被立案调查事件，共涉及15名入境人员。
According to incomplete statistics from Caijing, there have been six cases of import from abroad, involving a total of 15 people.
上述6起案例中，北京通报有2起，除前述廖某君案外，北京另一个被立案调查的王某某病例，直到入境多日后，才出现症状。
Of the six cases, Beijing notified two, in addition to the Liao Prince case mentioned above, another Beijing case was opened for investigation, not until more than many days after the arrival of symptoms.
根据通报：3月4日，王某某乘坐TG614航班返回北京。
According to the notice: March 4, Wang took flight TG614 back to Beijing.
3月7日，王某某出现发热、咽痛、乏力、头痛等症状，去医疗机构就诊，但血常规和CT检测未见异常。
March 7, Wang appeared fever, pharynx pain, fatigue, headache and other symptoms, to see a medical institution, but routine blood and CT examination did not see abnormalities.
3月12日，广东省疾控部门告知王某某，其在泰国旅游期间一同伴回国后检测为新冠核酸阳性。
March 12, Guangdong Province, CDC informed Wang Mou-mou, a companion during a trip to Thailand after the test for Nucleic Acid Positive.
3月13日，王某某由120救护车送至东方医院北京经济技术开发区院区隔离，经大兴区疾控中心检测结果为核酸阳性，后由120救护车转运至大兴区人民医院。
On March 13, Wang was transported by 120 ambulances to the East Hospital of the Beijing Economic and Technological Development Zone courtyard isolation, after Daxing District CDC test results of a positive nucleic acid, and then transferred by 120 ambulances to Daxing District People's Hospital.
3月14日诊断为确诊病例。
The confirmed case was diagnosed on 14 March.
北京市疾控中心3月15日发布消息，王某某未向社区报备私自去泰国旅游。
Beijing CDC announced on March 15, Wang did not report to the community to travel to Thailand.
自泰国返京后，亦未按规定主动向社区报备，“隐瞒行踪，没有按要求自觉落实好居家隔离措施”。
Since Thailand returned to Beijing, also did not take the initiative to report to the community, "hide their whereabouts, did not comply with the requirements of home isolation measures consciously."
目前针对隐瞒行踪相关责任人公安部门已立案调查。
At present, those responsible for concealing their whereabouts relevant public security departments have opened an investigation.
北京之外，还有多地通报境外输入病例被立案调查事件。
In addition to Beijing, there are many reported cases of foreign imports have been registered for investigation.
3月14日，宁夏中宁县公安局通报：确诊新冠肺炎人员丁某某于2020年2月下旬自伊朗返回国内。
March 14, Ningxia ZhongNing County Public Security Bureau reported that the diagnosis of new crown pneumonia personnel Ding in late February 2020 from Iran to return home.
对于丁某某被立案调查的原因，通报仅提到，“入境时存在涉嫌违反《中华人民共和国刑法》《中华人民共和国国境卫生检疫法》的情形”，未描述具体违法细节。
As for the reasons for the filing of the investigation, the circular only mentioned that "there were suspected violations of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China on the Health and Quarantine of the Frontier Province of the People's Republic of China" and did not describe the specific details of the violation.
除宁夏这份通报外，《财经》记者发现，其余5份通报显示，当事人均有瞒报行为，但他们所涉罪名并不完全一样。
In addition to the Ningxia circular, Caijing reporter found that the other five notices showed that the parties involved had committed acts of concealment, but that they were not all involved in the same crimes.
如北京通报的廖某君案例，及河南、甘肃、宁夏、浙江通报的4起案例，均以涉嫌妨害传染病防治罪被立案；而宁夏通报的案例，当事人因涉嫌妨害国境卫生检疫罪被立案。
For example, the case of Liao, notified by Beijing, and four cases reported by Henan, Gansu, Ningxia and Zhejiang were registered as suspected of obstructing the prevention and control of infectious diseases, while in Ningxia the case was filed on suspicion of obstructing the health and quarantine of the frontier.
北京通报的王某某案例则未提及所涉罪名。
Beijing reported the case of Wang did not mention the charges involved.
面对境外输入所带来的防疫风险，多地升级对此的防控措施。
Facing the risk of epidemic prevention brought by foreign import, many countries upgrade the prevention and control measures.
以北京为例，当地宣布，自3月16日起，所有境外进京人员，均将转送至集中观察点进行14天的隔离观察，隔离人员费用需自理。
Beijing, for example, announced that from March 16, all foreign visitors would be transferred to a centralized observation point for a 14-day quarantine at their own expense.
除实施集中隔离外，北京新增升级措施还包括，即日起，首都机场全部国际及港澳台地区进港航班，均停靠首都机场T3D处置专区。
In addition to the centralised quarantine measures, Beijing has also added the following new upgrade measures: From now on, all international and Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan inbound flights of the Capital Airport will call at the T3D disposal area of the Capital Airport.
全部入境人员严格落实《健康申报卡》填报，实施全员、全项、电子化、可追溯信息化管理，形成全方位、全链条、全闭环的立体防控体系。
All inbound personnel strictly follow the "Health Declaration Card" and implement the management of all-round, all-round, electronic and traceable information management, forming a three-dimensional control system with all-round, full-chain and fully closed-loop control.
北京市政府副秘书长陈蓓在前述新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情防控工作新闻发布会上表示，对虚报信息、隐瞒病情，造成疫情传播的人员将依法依规追究责任，并纳入信用体系。
Speaking at the aforementioned press conference on the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic, Bei Chen, deputy secretary-general of the Beijing Municipal Government, said that those who falsely reported information and concealed the disease so as to spread the disease would be held responsible according to law and incorporated into the credit system.
六类行为将被定罪最高人民法院、最高人民检察院、公安部、司法部、海关总署3月16日联合发布的《意见》明确了境外输入病例中的部分涉罪问题，将六大类主要行为所涉罪名明确为妨害国境卫生检疫罪。
The Opinions issued jointly by the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Justice and the General Administration of Customs on 16 March clarified some of the crimes involved in overseas import cases, and explicitly defined the six major categories of acts as crimes against the health and quarantine of the frontier.
中国卫生法学会常务副会长、清华大学法学院教授王晨光对《财经》记者表示，根据《刑法》的规定，妨害国境卫生检疫罪是指，违反国境卫生检疫规定，引起检疫传染病传播或者有传播严重危险的，处三年以下有期徒刑或者拘役，并处或者单处罚金。
According to the provisions of the Criminal Law, a crime of obstructing frontier health and quarantine refers to anyone who, in violation of the provisions of the frontier health and quarantine regulations, causes the spread of a quarantinable infectious disease or is in grave danger of spreading, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years or criminal detention and concurrently or solely fined.
《国境卫生检疫法》对检疫传染病进行了界定，所谓检疫传染病，是指鼠疫、霍乱、黄热病以及国务院确定和公布的其他传染病。
The Frontier Health and Quarantine Law defines a quarantinable infectious disease as plague, cholera, yellow fever and other infectious diseases determined and announced by the State Council.
王晨光介绍，此前的1月20日，国家卫健委正式发布2020年第1号文件，将新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎乙类传染病，并采取甲类传染病的预防、控制措施。
Wang said the previous January 20, the National Fitness and Health Commission issued the 2020 document No. 1, the new coronavirus infection of pneumonia B infectious diseases, and took measures to prevent and control Class A infectious diseases.
因此，这次《意见》将新冠肺炎纳入检疫传染病。
Therefore, the Opinion included the new crown pneumonia as a quarantinable infectious disease.
《意见》规定，引起鼠疫、霍乱、黄热病以及新冠肺炎等国务院确定和公布的其他检疫传染病传播或者有传播严重危险的，依照刑法的规定，以妨害国境卫生检疫罪定罪处罚。
Those who cause plague, cholera, yellow fever and pneumonia, and other quarantinable infectious diseases determined and announced by the State Council, or are in grave danger of spreading, shall be convicted and punished for obstructing the health and quarantine offence at the frontier in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Law.
《意见》明确，六类行为将以妨害国境卫生检疫罪定罪处罚，具体包括“检疫传染病染疫人或者染疫嫌疑人拒绝执行法律规定的卫生检疫和卫生处理措施的”、“采取不如实填报健康申明卡等方式隐瞒疫情，或者伪造、涂改检疫单、证等方式伪造情节的”、“知道或者应当知道一些特殊物品可能造成检疫传染病传播，未经审批仍逃避检疫，携运、寄递出入境的”、“出入境交通工具上发现有检疫传染病染疫人或者染疫嫌疑人，交通工具负责人拒绝接受卫生检疫或者拒不接受卫生处理的”、“来自检疫传染病流行国家、地区的出入境交通工具上出现非意外伤害死亡且死因不明的人员，交通工具负责人故意隐瞒情况的”、“其他拒绝执行海关依照国境卫生检疫法等法律法规提出的检疫措施的”。
If a person suffering from a quarantinable infectious disease or a suspect of an epidemic disease refuses to implement the health quarantine and sanitary measures prescribed by law, or who conceals the epidemic situation by means of false health declaration cards or by falsifying or altering quarantine certificates or other means of transport without approval
上述六类行为中的前两类因近期多次出现在各地通报中，尤其受到关注。
The first two of these six categories of conduct are of particular interest because of their recent and repeated presence in local communications.
如前所述，此前各地通报的被立案调查的境外输入病例中，所涉罪名并不一致，有多起病例是以依据《刑法》《传染病防治法》涉嫌妨害传染病防治罪予以立案。
As mentioned earlier, the offences involved in the previously notified cases of foreign importation for investigation were not consistent, and many cases were registered under the Law on the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases under the Criminal Law on the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases.
盈科律师事务所股权高级合伙人马德军告诉《财经》记者，法律界人士包括法官、律师等都认为存在妨害传染病防治罪和妨害国境卫生检疫罪的竞合问题，多数认为应当依法从一重罪处罚（从犯罪行为所触犯的罪名中选择其中的重罪来定罪量刑），但从这次《意见》来看，只要是在入境中发生的该类行为都应当以妨害国境卫生检疫罪定罪处罚。
Most members of the legal profession, including judges and lawyers, believe that the crime of obstructing the prevention and control of infectious diseases and the crime of obstructing the health and quarantine of the border should be punished according to law from a felony (the felony selected from among the crimes committed).
马德军认为，《意见》将前述六种行为方式纳入构成妨害国境卫生检疫罪的范围，具有立法推定的意义，也就是从立法上具有了这六种行为方式就推定具有犯罪的主观过错，除非有证据能够推翻。
In the view of Mademoiselle, the incorporation of the above-mentioned six forms of conduct into the scope of crimes constituting crimes against the health and quarantine of the frontier has the significance of legislative presumption, that is, from the legislative possession of these six forms of conduct on the presumption of criminal subjective fault, unless the evidence can be overturned.
从这个角度上看，“《意见》有利于更有效的依法惩治该类行为，有利于依法防控新型冠状病毒感染肺炎疫情。
From this point of view, "the Opinion is conducive to more effective legal punishment of this kind of acts, is conducive to the prevention and control of the new coronavirus infection pneumonia epidemic.
”针对各地升级防控措施，尤其是对于入境人员集中隔离，王晨光认为，“这是根据《国境卫生检疫法》，并结合世界卫生组织制定的《国际卫生条例》，涉及到国际层面的防控，更强调依法、科学、有序防控。
"This is in accordance with the Frontier Health and Quarantine Law and the International Health Regulations formulated by the World Health Organization, and involves prevention and control at the international level, with more emphasis on legal, scientific and orderly control," Wang said.
”王晨光解释，《国际卫生条例》提到，限制有嫌疑但无症状的个人或有嫌疑的行李、集装箱、交通工具或物品的活动和（或）将其与其他的个人和物体隔离，以防止感染或污染的可能传播；“嫌疑”指缔约国认为个人、行李、货物、集装箱、交通工具、物品或邮包已经暴露于或可能暴露于公共卫生危害并且有可能是传播疾病的可能来源。
The IHR, Wang explained, refers to restricting the activities of suspected but asymptomatic individuals or suspected luggage, containers, means of transport or objects and / or isolating them from other persons and objects in order to prevent possible spread of infection or contamination; "suspicion" refers to persons, luggage, cargo, containers, means of transport, goods or parcels that the State Party considers to be or may be a potential source of disease transmission.
中国的《国境卫生检疫法实施细则》也明确提到“染疫嫌疑人”，即接触过检疫传染病的感染环境，并且可能传播检疫传染病的人。
China's Rules for the Implementation of the Frontier Health and Quarantine Law also explicitly refer to a person suspected of having contracted an epidemic disease, that is, a person who has been exposed to an infected environment and may spread a quarantinable infectious disease.
因此，嫌疑人的范围比国内的疑似病例、密切接触者的范围要宽泛。
As a result, the range of suspects is broader than that of suspected cases and close contacts in the country.
“考虑到新冠肺炎在全球范围内暴发，有必要采取更严厉的观察措施。
"In the light of the global outbreak of new crown pneumonia, more stringent observation measures are needed.
” 王晨光说。
