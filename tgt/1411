记者/佟晓宇编辑/石爱华 宋建华刘畅穿上防护服，进入隔离室离开一岁多的孩子，刘畅上了“前线”，给儿子自然离乳的计划，没办法实现了。
Reporter / Tong Xiaoyu editor / Shi Aihua Song Jianhua Liu Chang put on protective clothing, into the isolation room left more than a year of children, Liu Chang on the "front line," giving his son a natural milk plan, can not be realized.
刘畅是一名耳鼻喉科的护士，她所在的医院是武汉市第一批收治新冠肺炎患者的定点医院之一。
Liu Chang, an ear, nose and throat nurse, was one of the first hospitals in Wuhan to treat patients with Newcastle Pneumonia.
疫情之下，她不得不离开还在哺乳期的儿子，走进隔离病房去照顾病人，“医院现在不分科室，所有人都要处理肺炎患者。
With the outbreak, she had to leave her breast-feeding son and go into the isolation ward to care for the sick.
”因为看到疫情重灾区很多孕产妇和自己一样，容易被紧张、恐慌的情绪“俘虏”，刘畅还加入了一支志愿服务队，下班后为她们在线答疑。
Seeing that many women in the hardest hit areas are as vulnerable to stress and panic as themselves, Liu Chang joined a volunteer service team and answered their questions online after work.
从起初的抗拒，到接受现实，开始冷静地面对病人、家人和咨询者，刘畅在“哺乳母亲”、“一线护士”、“线上志愿者”三个身份中逐渐找到平衡，变得坚定。
From initial resistance to accepting reality and calmly confronting patients, family members and counselors, Liu Chang has gradually found balance and strength in her roles as a nursing mother, first-line nurse and online volunteer.
“这个过程不只是接受那么简单”，刘畅说，她希望疫情快点结束，每个人都能重新回到原来的位置。
"It's not just accepting that," Liu said. "She wants the epidemic to end soon and everyone can get back to where they were.
上战场前，我最后一次喂母乳我今年28岁，做护士八年了。
I breast-fed for the last time before I went to war. I am 28 years old and have been a nurse for eight years.
2018年儿子出生，我当了妈妈。
When my son was born in 2018, I became a mother.
疫情来临后，每个人的生活都受到影响，对我来说，最不容易的是要跟孩子分开。
After the outbreak, everyone's life was affected, and for me, the hardest part was to be separated from my children.
从大年初一上班开始到现在，我已经23天没见过宝宝了。
I haven't seen the baby for 23 days since the beginning of New Year's Day.
我家离医院很远，开车要一个小时，往返不方便，加上每天在定点医院上班，我根本不敢回家，风险太大。
My home is far from the hospital, driving for an hour, the inconvenience of commuting, and the fact that I dare not go home every day at the designated hospital is too risky.
23天来，我寄宿在同事家，她老公和孩子春节前回了老家，只剩下她一人。
For 23 days, I stayed at my colleague's house. Her husband and children returned home before the Spring Festival. She was the only one left.
我吃的、喝的、用的全是她家的，我非常感激同事收留我。
I eat, drink, use all of her family, I am very grateful to my colleagues to take me in.
还有一些跟我情况差不多的同事，不得不住酒店，每天睡醒就吃碗泡面，很辛苦。
There are some colleagues like me, have to live in a hotel, every night after waking up to eat a bowl of noodles, very hard.
刚知道我们医院成为定点医院时，我很抗拒，也害怕。
When I first learned that our hospital had become a designated hospital, I was very resistant and afraid.
不是怕死，是因为要长时间与孩子分离。
Not afraid of death, because of the long separation from the child.
我的孩子一岁八个月，还在母乳喂养中，从他出生到现在，我们从没分开过，我不知道这次要多久。
My baby was 18 months old, still breastfeeding, and we've never been apart since he was born. I don't know how long this is going to take.
我接到通知初一要上临床，离家前我有五天假，我不断给儿子灌输接下来可能发生的事情：“妈妈可能很长一段时间不能回家，你也吃不到奶了，要吃牛妈妈的。
I was told that I would go to clinic on the first day of junior high school and that I had five days off before I left home. I kept telling my son what could happen next: "Mom may not be able to go home for a long time.
”宝宝一脸懵地看我，不太能够理解，但我能感受到，我焦虑不安的情绪能影响到他。
The baby looked at me, not understanding enough, but I could sense that my nervousness was affecting him.
我第一次跟他说这些的时候，他不停地摇头摆手，不愿意。
The first time I said this to him, he kept shaking his head and waving his hands.
但是我每天都在给他灌输，告诉他“妈妈要去战斗，去打怪兽”，要他在家乖乖听爸爸的话。
But I indoctrinated him every day, telling him, "Mom's going to fight, going after monsters," to be obedient at home.
我承诺他每天都会跟他视频，每天不停地跟他沟通这个事，后来，他也就慢慢接受了。
I promised him he would video him every day, talk to him about it every day, and then he would slowly accept it.
我第一次排班是大年初一下午五点，夜班。
My first shift is at 5 pm on New Year's Day, night shift.
下午三点准备出门时，我大包小包堆了一地，孩子从来没有见过我这样出门，平时这个时间他要睡午觉，但那天，他在奶奶怀里一点没闹，就静静地看着我。
As I was getting ready to leave the house at three in the afternoon, my child had never seen me go out like this. At this time he would take a nap, but on that day, without a scene in his grandmother's arms, he quietly watched me.
转身把门一关，我就哭了。
Turning to shut the door, I began to cry.
临出门之前，我给孩子喂了最后一次母乳。
Before I went out, I gave my baby one last breast milk.
我之前是想跟宝宝自然离乳的，现在看是不可能了。
I wanted to get rid of my baby naturally before, but now it seems impossible.
我不知道我的突然离开，会对他有什么影响。
I don't know what effect my sudden departure would have on him.
我尽量每天跟孩子视频一次，但有时真的没法保证。
I try to video my kids once a day, but sometimes it's really not a guarantee.
有时我晚上要上夜班，时间很不规律，很难跟孩子的时间对上。
Sometimes I have to work the night shift, the time is very irregular, and it is difficult to match the children's time.
前两天跟宝宝视频的时候，同事也在，她就顺势在旁边轻轻地拍了我几下，说打妈妈，平时这个动作可能不会引起孩子的注意，这一次他看到，嘴马上就瘪下来，边哭边摆手，哭了大概有20分钟。
Two days ago with the baby video, co-workers also in the side, she gave me a gentle pat on the side, said that the usual action may not attract the attention of the children, this time he saw, the mouth immediately flattened down, crying and crying for about 20 minutes.
之前我跟他说过很多次“妈妈去打坏人”，现在他可能以为自己的妈妈被坏人欺负了。
I have told him many times before "mother to hit bad people", now he may think his mother was bullied by bad guys.
有时候你觉得孩子很小，但他好像已经知道很多事情了。
Sometimes you think the child is very young, but he seems to already know a lot of things.
刘畅在线上为孕产妇解答问题恐慌的宝妈们，需要一针强心剂还有很多年轻的妈妈跟我一样，也在疫情中陷入迷茫。
Liu Chang online for the mother of panic questions, need a shot of heart-strengthening and many young mothers like me, also in the epidemic in the confusion.
我得知，一位叫邓芸的国际哺乳顾问组建了一只志愿队伍，专门面向湖北省孕产妇提供线上帮助，由湖北当地的妇产科医师、心理咨询师、哺乳顾问、母乳喂养咨询师组成，他们招募志愿者的时候，我心动了。
I learned that Deng Yun, an international lactation consultant, had set up a volunteer team to provide on-line help to pregnant women and women in Hubei Province.
成为妈妈后，我自己走过很多弯路，乳腺炎、堵奶、上班背奶，都经历过。
After becoming a mother, I walked a lot of detours, mastitis, milk, back to work, have experienced.
在这个特殊的时期，大家都不能出门，这些初为人母的妈妈们遇到困难怎么办？想到这儿，我第一时间就加入了。
At this special time, we can not go out, these new mothers encountered difficulties? Thought of here, I joined the first time.
每天，我们会有三个专业老师在微信群里解答妈妈们的疑问。
Every day, we have three professional teachers in the micro-letter group to answer the mother's questions.
从早上八点到下午六点，有时候到了晚上十二点答疑仍在继续。
From eight in the morning to six in the afternoon, sometimes until twelve o'clock in the evening the answer continues.
大家的问题多是新手妈妈们常见的，那些处于疫情重灾区的宝宝出现问题，不能轻易去医院，家长会很慌乱，这时候，你在网络上给出一个准确答复，告诉她们如何处理，就像一针强心剂，使她平复焦虑。
When a parent is upset that a baby in the hardest hit area is having trouble getting to a hospital, you give them an accurate answer on the Internet, telling them how to deal with it, just like a shot in the arm to calm her down.
比如，一些宝妈会问，如果孩子体温37度了怎么办？是不是发烧了，要不要去医院？提问题时她们就表现得很焦虑。
For example, some mothers ask, what if the child has a temperature of 37 degrees? Do they have a fever, do you want to go to the hospital? They are anxious when asked questions.
我回答问题的时候，会很谨慎小心，如果一些问题我不够了解，我会在工作群请教别的老师，尽量做到准确、有效的沟通。
When I answer questions, I will be careful. If I don't know enough about some questions, I will consult other teachers in my work group and try to communicate accurately and effectively.
对于我们志愿者来说，这也是一个学习并把学习成果转化给其他妈妈的过程，这个过程也消解了我的压力。
For our volunteers, it was also a process of learning and transferring the fruits of learning to other mothers, a process that also took the pressure off me.
我们医院是武汉市第一批收治新冠肺炎定点医院，刚开始回到医院的时候，我整晚都睡不好，也不知道自己到底睡着没有，好像睡着了，又好像什么都知道。
When I first came back to the hospital, I couldn't sleep all night. I didn't know if I was asleep. It was as if I was asleep and I knew everything.
当时整个脸是红肿的，牙龈也是红肿的。
The whole face was red and swollen, and the gums were red and swollen.
后来慢慢心情平复了，这些症状也就消失了。
Then the mood gradually calmed down and the symptoms disappeared.
我把自己的时间安排得满满的，尽量不让自己多想，越想内心会越焦虑。
I keep my time busy, trying not to think too much, the more anxious my mind will be.
大家都称赞医务人员的牺牲和付出，其实我们也很怕，可怕没用，越是怕负担越大，免疫力就会下降，反而被感染的机率会增大。
We all praise the sacrifice and dedication of medical staff, but we are also afraid, terrible useless, the greater the burden, the lower the immunity, and the higher the risk of infection.
刘畅在防护服上写下“武汉加油”病人走了，我在心里喊要坚强几天后，我内心反而比之前在家时平静了。
Liu Chang wrote on the protective clothing, "Wuhan refueling" patients left, I shouted strong in the heart for a few days, my heart is more calm than before when at home.
看到同事们都投入工作当中，自己也必须用最好的状态面对患者。
When you see your co-workers at work, you have to put yourself in the best position to deal with your patients.
我的第一班，上了10个小时，从下午五点半到第二天凌晨。
My first shift lasted 10 hours, from 5: 30 p.m. to the early hours of the next morning.
我从下午四点多就不敢喝水了，那个时候防护用品紧缺，我们进去之后就不能轻易出来。
I was afraid to drink from four o'clock in the afternoon, when supplies were scarce and we could not get out easily.
就算要出来，防护服脱了之后，也要放在紫外线环境下消毒。
Even if to come out, protective clothing off, but also in the ultraviolet environment to disinfect.
这其实不符合规范，防护服本来是一次性的，理论上防护时间只有4个小时左右，因为物资紧缺，也只能这样。
This is not in line with the norm, protective clothing is originally a one-time, theoretical protection time of only about four hours, because supplies are scarce, this can only be.
第一天，我把所有病人交接完，出来时已经凌晨两点半。
The first day I handed over all the patients and came out at half past two in the morning.
防护服里很热，整个人在里面反复地被汗浸湿，又被体温烘干，好不容易脱掉防护服坐下来，又感觉浑身发冷。
It was hot in the suit, and the whole body was repeatedly wet with sweat and warmed with heat. He took off his protective clothing and sat down, feeling cold again.
同事家的楼层已经没有人住了，我们回去后把衣服放在楼道口通风，然后再消毒，身上也是从头到脚清洗，每天洗手无数回，整个手干裂得不像样子，头发也快洗成稻草了。
The floor of our colleague's house was empty. We went back to air our clothes at the hallway, disinfect them again, wash our hands from head to foot, wash our hands innumerable times a day, our whole hands were dry and our hair was becoming straw.
我和同事因为排班不一样，休息的时间也不一样，谁在家就做好饭，就留一份放在桌上。
My colleagues and I because of different shift, rest time is not the same, who cooked at home, leave one on the table.
我以前在眼科、耳鼻喉科，病人基本上行动自由，不需要生活上的护理，治疗也比较简单，危重病人很少。
I used to be in ophthalmology, otorhinolaryngology, patients basically free movement, do not need life care, treatment is relatively simple, the critically ill few.
这次护理新冠肺炎患者，算是对我专业技术上的一次挑战。
It was a professional and technical challenge for me to take care of the new crown pneumonia patients this time.
穿上防护服，再带上手套，有时候连系止血带这样的操作都会很困难。
Wear protective clothing, gloves, and sometimes it can be difficult to tie a tourniquet.
除了治疗，还有很多护理工作。
In addition to treatment, there is a lot of care.
现在医院已不分科室了，统一收治病人，所有人都要面对新冠肺炎患者。
Now the hospital has no division, unified admission of patients, all have to face the new crown pneumonia patients.
病人住进来之后，处于隔离状态，没有家属陪伴，病人的吃喝拉撒全都需要我们。
When the patient came in, he was isolated, without family, and he needed us to eat, drink, and rasa.
有一个病人，病情很重，他在床上拉了大便，只能我来擦洗，帮他换尿不湿，换床单被套。
One patient, who was very sick, had stools in bed, so I had to scrub it, change his urine and change the bedspread.
有些危重病人，要用注射器帮助他吃饭、喝水。
Some critically ill people use syringes to help them eat and drink.
前两天有一个病人状况不是很好，他五十几岁，极度缺氧，上着高流量的氧气，仍然呼吸不畅，只能躺在床上，动弹不得。
The other day there was a patient who was in a bad condition, in his fifties, extremely hypoxic, with high-flow oxygen, still breathless, and unable to move.
他来医院的时候状况就不太好，但还能跟我们交流，可以说话。
He came to the hospital in a bad way, but he was still able to communicate and talk to us.
我看着他的状态一天不如一天，从开始的清醒，到慢慢的昏睡，血氧饱和度一度掉到30%。
I watched his condition deteriorate day by day, from the beginning of sobriety to slow lethargy, blood oxygen saturation dropped to 30%.
第二天那个病人走了。
The next day the patient left.
我们都知道，现在对病毒没有特效药，每次护理这样的病人，我心底就会喊，让自己坚强一点。
We all know that there is no specific medicine for the virus, every time I care for such a patient, my heart will cry, make yourself stronger.
如果是中夜班，我们需要两个人值班，面对至少三十个病人，每一个都要从头到尾照顾到。
If it's night shift, we need two people on duty, facing at least thirty patients, each from start to finish.
轻症患者可能会好一点，至少上厕所这些不需要我们去帮助。
People with mild illnesses may feel better. At least they don't need our help going to the toilet.
我感觉，在这个过程中，我们和患者之间的关系更近了。
I feel that in the process we are closer to the patient.
能够住进来的患者，都怀有一份感恩，他们也理解我们的辛苦，对我们更能够容忍。
The patients who are able to come in with a sense of gratitude, they also understand our hardship, we are more tolerant.
给患者抽血或者打针，有时不能一次穿刺成功的话，病人也能理解，穿上这身装备，这些简单的操作会变得困难。
When a patient is given a blood sample or injection, sometimes a successful puncture, the patient can understand that these simple procedures can be difficult with the equipment.
病人的包容，对我们来说是很欣慰的事。
The patient's tolerance is a great comfort to us.
有时，我非常想回家，但一想到也许我已经是一个病毒携带者，就不敢回了，只能够克制。
Sometimes, I really want to go home, but the thought that I may be a carrier of the virus, do not dare to go back, can only restrain.
孩子每天都有变化，他“断奶”的过程比我想象的顺利，现在已经习惯喝奶粉吃辅食了。
The child changes every day, he "weaned" process than I thought smooth, now has been used to drinking milk powder to eat auxiliary food.
儿子每天都会学到新的技能，他已经可以跟爸爸学说“宝贝”、“北京”这样的词汇了。
Every day his son learned new skills, and he was able to learn the words "baby" and "Beijing" from his father.
成为志愿者后，我收到不少哺乳期妈妈的反馈，她们说我的经验能帮到她们，让她们觉得哺乳这件事是简单、享受、幸福的。
When I became a volunteer, I received feedback from many lactating mothers who said my experience could help them feel that breastfeeding is simple, enjoyable and happy.
看到她们能与孩子更好地连结，也弥补了我在哺乳期离开孩子的遗憾。
Watching them connect better with their children also makes up for my regret that I left the baby during the nursing period.
突来的疫情会让人瞬间成长，有一些以前想不通的事情，现在觉得瞬间释然。
The sudden outbreak of the disease will let people grow up in a moment, there are some things that previously did not understand, now feel momentarily relieved.
我现在只希望疫情快点结束，让所有人回归到原来的位置。
I just want it to end soon and get everyone back to where they were.
