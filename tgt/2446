在全国人民上下一心抗疫冲锋的同时，上海始终没有忘记身在一线的“她们”。
In the next heart of the people in the fight against the epidemic, Shanghai has not forgotten the line of "them."
记者 | 应　琛在抗疫第一线，一套防护服需要穿多久？目前绝大多数的报道中，是8个小时，但实际上有时可能更久。
How long will it take to wear a suit at the front line of the epidemic? The vast majority of reports so far are for eight hours, but may actually take longer.
因为怕浪费物资，医护人员往往会穿尿不湿上阵，坚持不上厕所，直到工作结束再脱下。
Because of fear of wasting materials, medical staff will often wear urine not wet, do not stick to the toilet, until the end of the work before taking off.
同样也是在绝大多数报道中，由于一线防护物资紧缺，相关机构、企业、个人向疫情一线捐助口罩、防护服、护目镜等防护用品的故事也常见于报端。
Also in the vast majority of reports, due to the shortage of first-line protective materials, related organizations, enterprises, individuals donated masks, protective clothing, goggles and other protective equipment to the epidemic is also common in the newspapers.
但其中，有一种需求虽然一直源源不断传出，但因为声音没有那么大，起初并不像防护物资那般受到重视。
But there is a demand that has been coming out all the time, but because it's not that loud, it wasn't as important as the protective stuff at first.
这种需求就是一线女医护人员对于生理用品的需要。
This demand is the need of first-line female medical staff for physiological products.
前线女性生理用品到底匮乏到什么程度？从微博的相关话题中，可见一斑——一线的护士忍受着生理痛，向护士长申请了两天都没能拿到卫生用品。
How little is there for frontline female physiology? As can be seen from the microblog's related topics, first-line nurses endured physical pain and applied to the head nurse for two days without getting hygiene supplies.
支援方舱医院的海南护士只能靠尿不湿坚持，“血跟尿混在一起”。
Support the Hainan nurses in the cabin hospital can only rely on urine not wet insist, "blood and urine mixed together."
一个河北医疗队的护士生理期，裤子都湿透了。
The nurses of a Hebei medical team were wet through.
但她哭着不想出来换，只为节省一套防护服。
But she cried and did not want to change, just to save a suit of protective clothing.
Play令人心酸的是，在卫生用品缺乏、生理正常需求得不到照顾的情况下，部分一线人员甚至选择吃短效避孕药来延迟经期。
Play is saddening that some frontline staff even choose to take short-acting contraceptives to delay menstruation when hygiene supplies are scarce and physiological needs are not being met.
2月7日，微博网友@梁钰 Stacey 在微博发起#姐妹战疫安心行动#的话题，号召向一线的女性医护人员捐赠经期护理用品。
On February 7, Weibo netizen @ Leung Yu Stacey launched the # Sisterhood Disease Safe Action # topic on Weibo, calling for donations of menstrual care supplies to front-line female health care workers.
前些天，＃近4万包卫生巾运抵武汉＃的话题登上微博热搜。
A few days ago, nearly 40,000 bags of sanitary towels arrived in Wuhan # topics boarded Weibo hot search.
报道称，中国妇女发展基金会紧急筹集的近4万包卫生巾已运抵武汉，开始向抗疫一线女医护人员发放。
Nearly 40,000 packets of sanitary napkins urgently raised by the China Women's Development Foundation have arrived in Wuhan and started to be distributed to first-line female anti-epidemic medical personnel, the report said.
湖北省妇联安排将这批卫生巾发放给驰援武汉市武昌区、青山区的医护人员，以及华中科技大学同济医学院附属同济医院抗疫一线的医护人员。
The Hubei Provincial Women's Federation arranged that the sanitary napkins should be distributed to medical personnel in Wuchang and Qingshan districts of Wuhan city, as well as to the front-line staff of Tongji Hospital affiliated with Tongji Medical School.
事实上，在向一线女医护人员捐生理用品的接力中，上海最早行动。
In fact, Shanghai was one of the first to donate physiology supplies to first-line female health care workers.
上海市妇联在全国第一个发出了为一线女医护募集生理期用品的声音。
The Shanghai Women's Federation was the first in the country to raise physiological supplies for first-line female medical staff.
2月1日，市妇联、市三八红旗手协会与交大安泰EMBA领琇汇共同募集女性专用考拉裤送往武汉33家医院及黄冈相关医院。
On February 1, the Municipal Women's Federation, the City Red Flag Society and Jiaotai EMBA administered to 33 hospitals in Wuhan and Huanggang Hospital.
早在1月31日，上海市妇联、市总工会女职工委员会便发起倡议，希望有考拉裤（女性生理期护理用)等产品的爱心企业积极捐赠，或以低于市场价的爱心价格提供货源；同时接受现金形式的捐助，募捐款项专门用于购买考拉裤等产品。
As early as January 31, the Shanghai Women's Federation and the Municipal General Union Women's Workers' Committee launched an initiative to actively donate items such as koala pants (for female physiological care) or provide them at a loving price below the market price, while accepting donations in cash, which are earmarked for products such as koalas.
一句不经意的话引起48小时紧急行动“防护物资肯定缺啊……你知道的，防护服这些他们一穿就是8个小时不脱的。
A casual remark caused a 48-hour emergency operation "there must be a shortage of protective gear... you know, they wear it for eight hours."
放平时还好，忍忍也就过去了，但女医生护士遇到生理期，真的就相当难受了……”1月31日，上海市妇联在向瑞金医院的医生了解前线的需求时，这句不经意的话，引起了市妇联的高度重视。
On January 31, the Shanghai Municipal Women's Federation paid close attention to this casual remark when it asked the doctors and nurses at Ruijin Hospital about the needs of the frontline.
这天，上海市妇联从支援疫情最前线的医疗卫生机构获悉，医生中有50%以上为女性，一线女护士更超过90%。
On this day, the Shanghai Women's Federation learned from the medical and health institutions that support the epidemic that more than 50 percent of doctors are women and more than 90 percent of frontline nurses are women.
在女性生理期，卫生巾最多2小时就应更换，否则易滋生细菌。
In female physiology period, sanitary napkin should change at most 2 hours, otherwise easy to breed bacterium.
如何让她们能够持续投入高强度的工作，考虑到一线抗疫的特殊情况，上海市妇联副主席、新闻发言人翁文磊在接受《新民周刊》采访时表示，相对于卫生巾而言，考拉裤、拉拉裤等一些特殊卫生护理用品似乎更为实用，可以让一线女医护人员最大限度地减少穿脱防护服的次数。
In an interview with Xinmin Weekly, Weng Wenlei, vice-president of the Shanghai Women's Federation and press spokesman, told Xinmin Weekly that some special health care products, such as koalas and lesbians, seem to be more practical than sanitary towels in order to minimize the number of protective suits worn by first-line female medical workers.
想法有了，如何让想法落地。
The idea, how to let the idea fall to the ground.
巧合的是，市妇联主管的上海市儿童基金会刚刚通过民政部门的批准，可以扩大捐助对象。
Coincidentally, the Shanghai Children's Fund, which is run by the FMC, has just been approved by the civil affairs department to expand its donor base.
“儿基会的捐助对象一般是18岁以下的少年儿童。
"UNICEF generally targets children and adolescents under the age of 18.
但以往每次遇到重大灾情，我们儿基会都会提前和民政部门申请扩大捐助范围。
In the past, however, we at UNICEF have applied to the Civil Affairs Department in advance of each major disaster to broaden the donor base.
”翁文磊告诉记者，得知这个好消息后，市妇联立即立项，向一线女医护人员捐助考拉裤。
"Weng Wenlei told reporters that after learning the good news, the FMC immediately set up a project to donate koala pants to front-line women medical staff.
2月1日傍晚5时，市妇联、市儿基会、市女企业家协会首批100箱（9600片）女性专用考拉裤搭乘正要驶往武汉的集卡启运经过综合考虑，所有募捐物品除了捐赠给上海赴武汉医疗队女性工作人员外，还包括上海市公共卫生临床中心、上海市疾控中心一线女性医务人员，以及上海市110个发热门诊一线女性医务人员。
At 5 p.m. on February 1, the first batch of 100 boxes (9,600 pieces) of koalas for women belonging to the Municipal Association of Women Entrepreneurs was shipped to Wuhan. All the donations went to the Shanghai Public Health Clinic Center, the Shanghai CDC front-line medical staff and the 110 front-line female medical staff of the Shanghai Heating Clinic.
而募捐的物资数量和金额，则是基于人数、价格等计算得出，“如果每人经期为4天左右，每日至少使用3片卫生巾，那么每人每月至少需要12片。
The amount and amount of money collected are calculated on the basis of the number of people, prices, etc. "If each person has a menstrual period of about four days and uses at least three sanitary napkins a day, then each person needs at least 12 tablets per month.
我们想发动大家先捐1个月的量，所以提出首批捐5万片。
We want to get people to donate an initial amount of one month, so we propose an initial donation of 50,000 tablets.
而估算的每片考拉裤的平均价约为6块钱，所以募集30万。
The estimated average price for each pair of koalas is about $6, so raise 300, 000.
”当晚，市妇联的倡议书就通过网站、微信公众号、市妇联的各个群组等平台对外发布。
That evening, the Union's proposal was published through websites, micro-letters to the public and various groups of the Union.
第二天，市妇联的电话被“打爆”了！“没想到大家响应得那么快。
The next day, the MUW phone was "hit"! "I did not expect that the response so fast.
非常感动的是，很多市民捐钱，100、200、500元这样捐出来的。
Very moved, many citizens donated money, such as 100, 200, 500 yuan.
”翁文磊说，倡议也得到女企业家协会的大力支持，有成员立马捐出了考拉裤，还有成员表示可以免费提供物资运输，各医院也都欣然接收，“我们送去他们都感激得不得了，没有碰到不愿意的，也没有碰到任何障碍，非常通畅”。
The initiative also has strong support from the Association of Women Entrepreneurs, with some members donating koalas immediately, others offering free supplies and hospitals accepting them, said Weng. "We send them out with great gratitude, without encountering any reluctance or obstacles, and with great ease."
2月6日，市妇联、市儿基会为援鄂家庭捐赠物资2月1日傍晚5时，首批100箱（9600片）女性专用考拉裤便“搭乘”上了驶往武汉的集卡。
On February 6, the first batch of 100 boxes (9,600 pieces) of koalas for women was taken to Wuhan at 5 pm on February 1 by the Municipal Women's Federation and UNICEF.
而截至当天，项目已募集到了价值近200万元的物资和善款，远远超出了市妇联首批募集目标。
By the same day, the project had raised nearly two million yuan worth of materials and donations, far exceeding the first collection targets of the municipal women's federations.
在倡议发出后的48小时内，2月2日下午，首批物资运抵武汉，随后被立即送到了医务人员手中。
Within 48 hours of the launch of the initiative, the first supplies arrived in Wuhan on the afternoon of 2 February and were immediately delivered to medical personnel.
同时，向本市女医护人员捐赠考拉裤也已集结准备运出。
Concurrently, the donation of koalas to the city's female medical staff has also been assembled for shipment.
2月1日傍晚5点，第一批100箱考拉裤启运截至2月12日，上海市妇联、上海市儿童基金会已经派送和动员赠送到上海赴武汉各医疗队、孝感、黄冈、随州当地医院的考拉裤、成人纸尿裤58820片。
As of February 12, the Shanghai Women's Federation and Shanghai Children's Fund had sent and mobilized koalas from local hospitals in Wuhan, Xiaogan, Huanggang and Suizhou to send and mobilize 58,820 pieces of adult diapers.
2月19日，市妇联、市儿基会、市女企业家协会捐赠孝感市中心医院100箱安心裤最新数据显示，截至2月26日，在各方的大力支持和广泛参与下，由上海市妇联牵头捐赠的考拉裤总数已超过13万片。
The latest statistics show that as of February 26, the number of koalas donated by the Shanghai Municipal Women's Federation, the Municipal Foundation and the Municipal Association of Women Entrepreneurs exceeded 130,000 pieces, with strong support and broad participation.
2月18日，市妇联、市儿基会、日本大王公司捐赠的1086箱纸尿裤等卫生用品通过邮政航空和专车运抵孝感市，分配至县市区和市直有关医疗机构记者了解到，上海市妇联不光为女性募集生理卫生用品，2月13日，上海市妇联、上海市妇女儿童服务指导中心（巾帼园）、上海市女性社会组织发展中心联合发起“罩”护一线，把爱送给最需要的人口罩募集行动，号召市级女性社会组织将“战疫”前线紧缺急需的口罩节约下来，捐赠给更需要的人。
On February 18, 1,086 boxes of toilet articles such as diapers donated by MUJAO, UNICEF and Japan King Company arrived in Xiaogan City by post and special bus. Reporters of the medical organizations concerned learned that on February 13, the Shanghai Women's Federation, Shanghai Municipal Women's Service Guidance Center and Shanghai Women's Social Organization Development Center jointly launched a campaign.
市妇联等组织联合发起“罩”护一线，把爱送给最需要的人口罩募集行动截至目前，共收到市级女性社会组织、会员和爱心企业捐赠的55317个口罩（包含两个护目镜），其中54147个口罩（包含两个护目镜）已分批送往第八批上海援鄂医疗队和上海地区有需要的医院，剩余1170个口罩将送至下一批援鄂医疗队。
So far, 55,317 face masks (including two goggles) have been donated by municipal women's social organizations, members and caring enterprises. Of these, 54147 face masks (including two goggles) have been sent in batches to the eighth batch of medical teams in Shanghai and to needy hospitals in the Shanghai area.
在上海，女性的需求一直被看见很快，这场由上海最早行动的支援一线女医务人员卫生用品的行动得到了越来越多机构和个人的支持。
In Shanghai, where the needs of women have always been visible, the campaign to support front-line health workers with hygiene supplies, one of Shanghai's first operations, is gaining support from a growing number of institutions and individuals.
人民日报官方微博2月14日发布消息，全国妇联所属中国妇女发展基金会紧急募集定向援助一线女性医务人员款物225万元，其中用于定向采购安心裤资金20万元、价值100万元卫生巾2020箱、价值5万元安心裤2万个和价值100万元的秋衣秋裤。
The All-China Women's Development Fund has raised 2.25 million yuan for targeted medical personnel, including 200,000 yuan for targeted purchase of comfort pants, 2,020 boxes of sanitary napkins worth 1 million yuan, 20,000 pieces of comfort pants worth 50,000 yuan, and 1 million yuan worth of autumn pants, the All-China Women's Development Fund said Monday.
首批2万个安心裤将于近日运抵武汉。
The first 20,000 slacks will arrive in Wuhan in the near future.
2月18日，新华社发文称，中国妇女发展基金会紧急筹集的近4万包卫生巾已运抵武汉，开始向抗疫一线女医护人员发放。
On February 18, Xinhua reported that nearly 40,000 bags of sanitary napkins raised by the China Women's Development Foundation had arrived in Wuhan and began to be distributed to women first-line health workers against the epidemic.
一线女医护人员的窘境终于渐渐得到解决。
The plight of frontline women health workers is finally being addressed.
但这件事却也暴露了另一个人们主观意识上的种种问题。
But it also reveals another set of subjective problems.
有些人认为，女性卫生用品并非必需品。
Some people believe that female hygiene items are not essential.
有人质疑，姨妈巾有口罩重要？甚至有人说，人命关天时，哪有时间关心“裤裆那点事”。
Some people doubt that auntie scarf mask important? Some people even said that when life, who has time to care about "crotch that thing."
不论是生理知识不足，还是心理上刻意贬低经期这一正常生理过程，这些漠视的行为都让人不齿。
Whether the lack of physiological knowledge, or the psychological degeneration of the normal physiological process of menstruation, these indifferent behavior is scandalous.
在此次抗疫期间，习近平总书记说，要把人民群众生命安全和身体健康放在第一位。
During the battle against the disease, General Secretary Xi Jinping said people's lives and health should be put first.
同样的，习总书记也多次强调，要坚持男女平等基本国策。
Likewise, Xi has repeatedly stressed the need to uphold the basic state policy of equality between men and women.
难道逆行的女性，她们的生命安全和身体健康，不需要被呵护吗？正如人民日报在《女性逆行，尊重比赞美更重要》的评论中写道——“武汉金银潭医院重症监护室一位护士接受媒体采访，谈及自己处于生理期的透支状态，结果再播出时，‘生理期’三字不见了。
Do retrograde women, whose lives are safe and healthy, do not need to be cared for, as the People's Daily wrote in a commentary entitled "Women Retrograde, Respect Is More Important than Praise" - "A nurse in the intensive care unit of Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital spoke to the media about her physiological state of overdraft.
这让人费解。
This is difficult to understand.
”“然而，有记者热衷报道怀孕9个月的护士身穿防护服在一线坚持，流产才10天的护士又回到一线工作……鼓励这样的极端行为，考虑过对母婴的伤害、对当事人健康威胁有多大吗？即便是自愿，媒体要做的也应是劝阻而不是颂扬。
"However, one journalist has been keen to report that nurses who are nine months pregnant wear protective clothing on the front lines, and nurses who have had abortions for only 10 days are back on the front line... encouraging such extreme behaviour, considering the harm done to mothers and babies, the threat to the health of the person concerned.
”“说回直播女护士含泪被剃光头，至少有欠同理心和同情心。
"" To return the live broadcast of a female nurse with her head shaved in tears is at least not empathetic and compassionate.
”其实，这类报道本身并无恶意，甚至记者们的内心也确实被“感动”。
In fact, there was no malice in the reports themselves, and even journalists were "touched" in their hearts.
但这至少也说明了，尊重和爱护女性的意识，远没有深入人心。
But at least it also shows that the idea of respecting and caring for women is far from being internalized.
或许，当人民可以坦然公开讨论一线女性生理期需求时，这个社会才是正常的、安全的、温暖的。
Perhaps, when people can openly discuss the needs of a first-line female physiological needs, this society is normal, safe, warm.
那些每天坚守在岗位上，承受着极高暴露风险的女性医务人员，还在忍受一种作为女性最原始的痛苦和尴尬所幸，在全国人民上下一心抗疫冲锋的同时，上海始终没有忘记身在一线的“她们”。
The female medical staff, who hold on to their posts every day and are exposed to a high level of exposure, are still suffering from a kind of primal pain and embarrassment as women.
“有一个很容易被忽略的团队，就是我们的护理团队。
"One team that is easy to ignore is our nursing team.
你认为我们的医生有多重要，我们的护理姐妹们就有多重要。
How important do you think our doctors are and how important our nursing sisters are.
”上海医疗救治专家组组长、华山医院感染科主任张文宏在此前接受采访时就曾强调，现在都在歌颂医生，但比较完整的说法应该是医护人员。
Zhang Wenhong, head of the Shanghai Medical Treatment Expert Group and director of the Infection Department at Huashan Hospital, stressed in an interview that doctors are now being praised, but a more complete description would be health-care workers.
Play“我们在推进捐赠的过程中，接触到的各区负责对接工作的男性负责人时，他们也都是非常积极地在帮忙，丝毫没有觉得这不重要。
"As we moved forward with our donation, the men in charge of docking in the districts we spoke to were also very active in helping, not feeling unimportant.
”翁文磊表示，“贯彻男女平等基本国策，将社会性别意识纳入决策主流，目前已经有了非常良好的基础。
"There is now a very good basis for implementing the basic state policy of gender equality and mainstreaming gender awareness in policy-making," said Mr Weng.
我们希望今后遇到类似的情况，这些女性特殊时期需要的用品在最初就能够得到重视，并出现在政府相关部门采购的保障物资里，再由社会力量作为补充。
It is hoped that similar situations will arise in the future, when the needs of these women for specific periods of time will be taken into account initially and will be supplemented by social forces in the form of guaranteed supplies procured by the relevant government departments.
”上海市青浦区社区医院接受市妇联捐赠征集令《新民周刊》现面向全国征集新冠肺炎采访对象和真实故事：如果你是参与抗击新冠肺炎疫情的医护人员或其家属，我们希望聆听你的“战疫”故事，也希望传达你的诉求。
