””新加坡最大的商业银行星展银行（DBS）12日证实，该银行一名职员确诊感染新型冠状病毒。
The DBS, Singapore's largest commercial bank, confirmed yesterday that a staff member of the bank had been diagnosed with the new coronavirus.
截至当天中午，新加坡确诊的新冠病毒感染病例已达50例，除受“钻石公主号”邮轮疫情影响的日本外，是中国以外病例最多的国家。
By noon that day, Singapore had confirmed 50 new cases of the virus, the highest number of cases outside China, with the exception of Japan, which was affected by the cruise ship Princess Diamond.
据《联合早报》12日报道，星展银行当天下午发布公告说，已有一名职员感染新冠病毒。
Lianhe Zaobao reported that the same afternoon, the Development Bank announced that a staff member has been infected with the new crown virus.
该职员前一日接受了检测，当天早上确诊。
The employee was tested the day before and diagnosed the same morning.
星展银行表示，已经在当天12时前撤离了其所在的滨海湾金融中心第三大厦的受影响楼层，并已对办公场所进行了消毒，正在展开追踪接触者的工作，银行的其他职员将在家办公。
The bank said it had evacuated the affected floors of its third building in the Gulf Coast financial centre before 12: 00 pm and had disinfected its office space, and was in the process of tracking contacts and other bank staff would be working from home.
据了解，滨海湾金融中心共设三座办公大楼，入驻企业以金融机构、律师事务所、商业资讯科技公司、跨国矿产及粮食贸易公司为主，如渣打银行、贝克·麦坚时律所等。
It is understood that there are three office buildings in the Binhai Bay Financial Centre, which are mainly staffed by financial institutions, law firms, commercial information technology companies and multinational mineral and grain trading companies such as Standard Chartered Bank and Baker McKinnon Law Firm.
其中，星展银行总部所在的3座共46层。
Among them, there are 46 floors in the three headquarters of the Development Bank.
据路透社12日报道，星展银行撤离的受影响楼层为三座43层。
According to Reuters reported on the 12th, the development bank evacuated the affected floor of three 43-story.
该行新加坡主管许志坤（Shee Tse Koon）当天在一份内部备忘录中告知了员工这一消息，表示该楼层的300名员工需要全部撤离。
Singapore director Shee Tse Koon told employees the same day in an internal memo that all 300 employees on the floor needed to be evacuated.
一位在新加坡工作的金融界人士则在12日告诉界面新闻，目前，滨海湾金融中心3座除43层外的其他楼层仍在正常办公。
A Singapore-based financier told the interface Monday that three floors outside the 43-storey Binhai Bay financial centre were still open.
他表示，该中心距离此前有病例确诊的君悦酒店开车仅11分钟，除星展银行外，在邻近办公的一些金融机构如今也已经出现了疑似病例，正在进行排查。
He said the center was only 11 minutes away from the Grand Hyatt hotel, which had previously been diagnosed, and that, in addition to the Development Bank, a number of financial institutions in close proximity to the bank had now developed suspicious cases and were being cleared.
源头不明与社区感染随着2月7日出现感染源头不明的病例，证实有社区感染迹象，新加坡政府已将疫情警戒层级从黄色升至橙色（最高为红色）。
Source unknown and community infection The Singapore Government has raised the alert level from yellow to orange (maximum red) following an unknown source of infection on February 7, confirming signs of infection in the community.
据新加坡卫生部通报，截至12日中午12时，新加坡已累计确诊50例新冠肺炎病例。
As of 12 noon on Sunday, Singapore had confirmed 50 cases of new crown pneumonia, the Health Ministry said.
其中22例为境外输入，28例为本地感染，8例感染源不明。
Of these, 22 cases were imported from abroad, 28 were local infections and 8 were of unknown origin.
其中，有8例为重症，27例病情稳定，15例已治愈。
Among them, 8 cases were severe, 27 cases were stable and 15 cases were cured.
图片来源：新加坡卫生部在7日前，新加坡的本地感染病例基本都与药行“永泰丰”以及曾召开行业会议的君悦酒店有关。
Source: Singapore Health Ministry reported 7 days ago that local infections in Singapore were linked to the drug company Yongtai Fung and the Grand Hyatt Hotel, which held trade meetings.
4日，曾接待中国旅行团的“永泰丰”有两名员工确诊，其中一名员工的家政工人以及曾前往该店的一名导游也在当天确诊，5日，上述员工及导游的三名亲属又再确诊。
On May 4, two staff members of Yongtai Fung, who had received a Chinese tour group, confirmed the diagnosis, as did the domestic worker of one of the employees and a tour guide who had been there on the same day.
截至12日中午，与永泰行有关的确诊病例已达9例。
As of noon on December 12, 9 cases had been confirmed in connection with Wing Tai Hang.
而与君悦酒店有关的确诊病例也有3例，分别在6日和8日确诊。
There were also 3 confirmed cases related to the Grand Hyatt Hotel on June 6 and 8 respectively.
此前，马来西亚与韩国已先后确诊了1例与2例与该酒店所召开的会议有关的病例。
Malaysia and South Korea have previously confirmed one case in connection with two meetings with the hotel.
但从7日开始，新加坡开始陆续出现更多无中国旅行史、感染源头不明的病例，这些病例工作与生活的地点分布在基督生命堂、维多利亚初级学院、圣淘沙名胜世界等地，其中6人近期曾前往马来西亚，还有2人为孟加拉国人。
But since the 7 th, Singapore has seen more cases of non-Chinese travel and unidentified sources of infection. The work and lives in places such as the Christian Life Hall, Victoria Junior College and Saintly Taungsha World. Six of them have recently travelled to Malaysia and two are Bangladeshis.
目前，新加坡卫生部正在通过电访追踪、查证与核实资料等方式追踪确诊患者的密切接触者，同时也在扩大检测范围，为疑似病例提供更快的诊断测试。
At present, the Ministry of Health of Singapore is tracking close contacts of confirmed patients by means of tracing, verification and verification of information, and is also expanding the scope of testing to provide faster diagnostic tests for suspected cases.
截至12日，已有961人被联系隔离，638人经检测呈阴性，125人正在检测中。
As at 12 December, 961 people had been isolated, 638 had been tested negative and 125 were being tested.
从本周开始，新加坡金融区的一些办公室已开始检测员工的体温，并张贴了相应提醒，包括星展银行在内的一些企业也已将线下会议改为了电话会议。
Since this week, some offices in Singapore's financial district have begun testing staff for body temperature, and have posted warnings that companies, including DBS, have switched off-line meetings to teleconferences.
“错误的安全感”尽管一切看似井然有序，但在外界看来，新加坡在疫情响应方面似乎有些“心大”。
"Wrong sense of security" Despite all the seeming orderliness, Singapore appears to be somewhat "ambitious" in its response to the outbreak.
不仅在7日晚举行了“万民善信庆元宵”晚会，新加坡航展也在11日照常开幕。
Not only held on the evening of the 7th, "the people of the people, the Lantern Festival," the Singapore Air Show also opened on the 11 as usual.
联合晚报6日有关“万民善信庆元宵”晚会的报道只不过受疫情影响，元宵晚会的赴会人数与往年的万人相比锐减过半。
The Lianhe Evening News's report on the "Lantern Festival" evening party was only affected by the epidemic, with attendance at the Lantern Festival gala down by more than half from the previous year's 10,000.
而航展方面，洛克希德·马丁、庞巴迪、德哈维兰等70多家国际参展商也都放弃了参加本次展会。
At the show, more than 70 international exhibitors, including Lockheed Martin, Bombardier and Dehaveland, also gave up the show.
目前，新加坡卫生部针对疫情出台的防范措施与世界卫生组织给出的建议类似，如不要食用未煮熟肉类、避免前往人多的场所、保持良好的个人卫生习惯等。
At present, the Ministry of Health has adopted preventive measures similar to those recommended by the World Health Organization, such as refraining from eating undercooked meat, avoiding crowded places and maintaining good personal hygiene practices.
针对学校等场所，也出台了停办大型活动、人员错峰休息等相应措施。
For schools and other places, also issued to stop large-scale activities, staggered rest of personnel and other appropriate measures.
不过，随着新加坡确诊病例数量的增加，有关口罩使用的建议正在引发争议。
However, as the number of confirmed cases in Singapore increases, recommendations on the use of masks are sparking controversy.
该国卫生部仅提出，若有咳嗽或流鼻涕等呼吸道疾病症状，请务必戴口罩，其他情况则未作要求。
The Ministry of Health only advises people to wear masks if they have respiratory symptoms such as coughing or runny nose, but not in other cases.
对此，新加坡卫生部长颜金勇7日表示，接触、飞沫感染是新冠病毒最主要的传播途径，目前没有证据表明病毒通过空气传播，尽管本地出现社区感染迹象，健康的人仍无需戴口罩，勤洗手才是最佳防御方法。
In response, Singapore Health Minister Yan Jinyong said 7, contact, droplet infection is the most important transmission of the new crown virus, there is no evidence of transmission through the air, although local signs of community infection, healthy people still do not need to wear masks, wash hands is the best defense.
他说，“健康的人戴口罩往往会给我们一种错误的安全感。
"Healthy people wearing masks tend to give us a false sense of security," he said.
”在南洋理工大学留学的小A告诉界面新闻，据她观察，现在在学校里，戴口罩的人还是相对较少，而且主要以中国人为主，少于50人的课堂也还在上课。
"Little A, who studies at Nanyang Technological University, told Interface News she observed that relatively few people still wear masks in schools and classes with fewer than 50 students are mostly Chinese.
她说，有条件的学院会发一些口罩，但校内防控疫情的措施主要是上下午测量体温，以及加强宿舍等地的消毒工作，针对从重点地区返回的师生，也设置了用于隔离的宿舍。
While some face masks will be distributed at conditional colleges, measures to prevent and control the epidemic in schools include taking temperature measurements in the morning and afternoon, strengthening disinfection of hostels and other places, and setting up separate dormitories for teachers and students returning from key areas, she said.
在她看来，新加坡的反应的确有些出乎她的意料。
In her view, Singapore's reaction did come as a surprise.
原本以为有“非典”的教训在前，新加坡这次会很严格，但现在好像“动作挺慢”，可能是为了不让民众感到恐慌。
Originally thought to have "SARS" lessons in the past, Singapore will be very strict this time, but now seems to "move very slowly," perhaps to avoid panic.
在新加坡的疫情警戒层级中，橙色代表疾病严重，容易在人与人之间传染，但还未在新加坡大范围传播，疫情正得到控制。
In Singapore's epidemic alert hierarchy, orange represents a serious disease that is easily transmitted from person to person, but it has not spread widely in Singapore and the epidemic is under control.
在橙色警戒下，需要采取中等程度的措施，如隔离、测温、限制医院出入等。
Under the orange alert, medium-level measures such as isolation, temperature measurement and restricted access to hospitals are required.
在2003年“非典”流行时，新加坡发布的也是橙色警戒，当时该国出现了238例感染，33例死亡。
At the time of the 2003 SARS epidemic, Singapore issued orange alert, with 238 infections and 33 deaths.
“前线更需要”根据12日22时发布的疫情数字计算，目前新冠肺炎在湖北之外的中国其他地区的致死率约为0.43%，在湖北的致死率约为3.2%。
The death rate in other parts of China outside Hubei is about 0.43 percent, and in Hubei it is 3.2 percent, according to figures released at 2200 hours on the 12 th.
“非典”的平均死亡率则约为9.6%。
The average SARS mortality rate is 9.6 percent.
新加坡总理李显龙8日在谈及疫情时曾表示，如果疫情的传播难以被控制，致死率能与流感0.01%的致死率保持相似，或许会改变策略。
Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on the 8th, if the spread of the disease is difficult to control, the death rate and flu rate of 0.01% similar, may change strategy.
但其实，新加坡政府并非没有迅速响应疫情。
But the Singapore government did not fail to respond quickly.
小A说，政府一直在追踪相应人员的活动轨迹。
Xiao A said the government has been tracking the movements of its counterparts.
她了解到，新加坡人力部也正在通过短信、电话甚至是突击检查，联系持有工作准证、并正在新加坡工作的外籍员工，要求大家报告自己的定位。
She understands that Singapore's Ministry of Manpower is also contacting expatriate workers in Singapore with work permits through text messages, phone calls and even dawn raids to ask them to report on their positions.
而划定“橙色警戒”的新加坡疾病暴发应对系统（DORSCON），也是该国在“非典”后制定的一项防疫预案。
And the Singapore Disease Outbreak Response System (DORSCON), designated "Orange Alert," is the country's post-SARS response plan.
该系统不仅很详细地针对相关情况下的防范措施、政府跨部门协调、出入境控制、公众交流、应急物资采购等方面的应对措施做了说明，对疫情出现时的隔离、治疗、探访、甚至尸体处置也做出了指导性安排。
The system is not only detailed in terms of preventive measures in relevant situations, cross-government coordination, immigration control, public communication, procurement of emergency supplies, but also provides guidance on quarantine, treatment, visits and even disposal of corpses in the event of an outbreak.
在新加坡从事教育行业的小B告诉界面新闻，在测量体温方面，部门与机构还是抓得很紧的，在她工作的场所，体温超过37.5度就会要求回家，所有访客进门前也都必须测量体温。
In Singapore, where the temperature exceeds 37.5 degrees, departments and agencies are still holding on to the thermometer, she told Interface News. All visitors must also have their body temperature taken before they enter.
她表示，住在新加坡的人，每家也可以凭借身份证件，领取四只普通口罩，但只发放一次。
People living in Singapore, she says, can also get four ordinary face masks per family, depending on their identity documents, but only once.
不过，对当地政府举措表达质疑的，多数都是在新加坡读书或工作的中国人，她认识的本地人相对来说还是比较冷静，现在超市的货品尽管看起来比之前要少一些，但也并不是一扫而空。
But most of the skepticism about local government initiatives comes from Chinese studying or working in Singapore, where people she knows are relatively calm and where goods, though seemingly smaller than before, are not swept away.
7日新加坡升级“橙色警戒”时，部分超市曾出现“抢购潮”。
7 Singapore upgrade "orange alert", some supermarkets have had a "rush."
来源：Twitter李显龙在8日的讲话中也强调，新加坡已进一步提升了疫情防控的等级和措施，包括减少学校的人流，减少医院中可能出现的交叉感染，对大型公共聚会采取更为谨慎的应对态度等。
Source: Twitter's Lee Hsien Loong also stressed in his speech on the 8th that Singapore has further upgraded its epidemic prevention and control measures, including reducing the flow of people to schools, reducing possible cross-infections in hospitals and adopting a more cautious approach to large public gatherings.
他表示，政府正在预先考虑、提前准备。
He said the government was thinking ahead and preparing ahead of time.
若疫情的致死率上升，政府也将会改变措施，鼓励轻症患者去看家庭全科医生、在家休息，从而将紧张的医院资源留给那些对病毒更缺乏抵抗力的人群。
If the fatality rate rises, the government will also change measures to encourage light patients to see family doctors and rest at home, leaving strained hospital resources to those less resistant to the virus.
至于“该不该戴口罩”，其夫人何晶则在前一日做出了解答。
As for whether or not to wear a mask, his wife, Ho Jing, answered the question the day before.
她在社交媒体上写道，如今全世界的医用外科口罩及其材料都很短缺，这是因为在疫情暴发前，全球50%以上的医用外科口罩都是中国生产的。
'There is a worldwide shortage of surgical masks and their materials, because before the outbreak, more than 50% of all medical surgical masks were made in China, 'she wrote on social media.
何晶说，现在越南、泰国等地都已禁止或限制了口罩的出口，新加坡虽然还有一些库存，但若此次疫情还将持续一段时间，那么口罩也会不够用。
Now Vietnam, Thailand and others have banned or restricted the export of face masks, and while Singapore has some stocks, it won't be enough if the epidemic continues for some time to come, he said.
“为防患于未然，我们应该把口罩优先留给将会在这场疫情中处于最前线的医护人员。
"As a precaution, we should give priority to surgical staff who will be at the forefront of the epidemic."
”新加坡卫生部长颜金勇也已于12日表示，将向私人诊所发放100万只口罩。
Singapore's health minister, Yan Jinyong, said Tuesday that he would distribute one million masks to private clinics.
当然，在一些医生看来，有条件的民众还是应该在日常生活中做好防护。
Of course, in the view of some doctors, people who are able to afford it should be protected in their daily lives.
周一，来自三家新加坡诊所及一家澳大利亚诊所的四名医生已联名发表了一封公开信，提醒民众在外出时应佩戴口罩。
On Monday, four doctors from three Singapore clinics and one Australian clinic issued an open letter reminding people to wear masks when going out.
其中一位医生科琳·托马斯（Colleen Thomas）在接受新加坡网络媒体The Online Citizen采访表示，截至11日中午，47例确诊病例中有7例重症，已值得引起警惕，“在重症率还未突破0.2时，我们更该多加注意。
One of the doctors, Colleen Thomas, told The Online Citizen in Singapore, said seven of the 47 confirmed cases were serious as of noon yesterday, giving cause for alarm.
”那没有口罩该怎么办呢？“要开动脑筋，”信中这样写道，“比如有些人买了可水洗的口罩，将它们缝好，加一点合适的纸，或是在脸上裹一条围巾，都比没有口罩要强。
"Use your head," the letter says. "For example, some people buy washable masks, sew them up, put a bit of paper on them, or wrap a scarf around their faces, which is better than not wearing a mask.
