从2003年抗击SARS疫情起，每逢新的疫病出现，香港人总会联想到“淘大花园”，这座被符号化的楼盘牵涉的社会现实，对于理解当下香港特区防疫体系的压力仍有意义2月初，食物环境卫生署开始在香港大街小巷挂出相关宣传标语。
Since the fight against SARS in 2003, Hong Kong people have always associated themselves with the "Amoy Garden" whenever a new outbreak occurs. The symbolized property market is still relevant to the understanding of the prevailing epidemic prevention system in the HKSAR. Early in February, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) began to display relevant posters in the streets and lanes of Hong Kong.
文 |《财经》记者 焦建编辑 | 苏琦春节前后，新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情从中国内地向中国香港特区蔓延。
New coronavirus pneumonia has spread from mainland China to the Hong Kong SAR of China around New Year's Day, Caijing's reporter Jiao Jian.
全城抢购导致香港的口罩、蔬菜、大米、肉类价格上涨或断货，各类消毒用漂白水亦在多种销售渠道告急。
Buying and buying masks, vegetables, rice and meat in Hong Kong has led to price increases or disruptions. Bleaching water for disinfection is also in short supply in a variety of marketing channels.
究其用处，除加强清洁时使用之外，主要是被香港人稀释后倒入家庭卫生间内的厕所U型水槽/聚水器（内地称“存水弯”）。
The utility model, apart from enhancing cleaning, is mainly diluted by Hong Kong people and poured into the toilet U-shaped cistern / collector in the family toilet (referred to as "water storage bend" in the Mainland).
香港人的担心是：新型冠状病毒可透过粪便传播，为防重现17年前SARS疫情时淘大花园内因厕所U形水槽变成传播病毒渠道，必须早做准备。
The concern of Hong Kong people is that the new coronavirus can be transmitted through feces. To prevent a recurrence of the SARS epidemic 17 years ago, preparations must be made to prevent the toilet flume from becoming a conduit for the transmission of the virus.
《财经》记者所熟悉的多位居住在深港两地的朋友，近日则开始分享相关经验：为进行预防（特别是同小区内出现患者），可以用漂白水或者消毒水1:49兑冷水，每天早晚倒一些到家中所有的水槽（切记包括地漏），保证U形水槽存有水分，隔离病毒。
Many friends living in Shenzhen and Hong Kong, known to Caijing journalists, have recently started to share their experience. For prevention (especially with patients in small areas), use bleach or disinfectant at 1: 49 cold water. Every morning and evening, they pour some water into all the gutters at home (including leaks) to keep the water in the U-shaped tank and isolate the virus.
因类似情况太多，以至于香港大学感染及传染病中心总监何栢良近日开始公开呼吁称：“定期以肥皂及清水洗手，另如厕后须盖上厕板才冲厕。
Mr Duncan Ho, Director of Infectious Diseases and Infectious Diseases at the University of Hong Kong, has recently launched a public appeal to wash his hands regularly with soap and water.
此外，每日倒清水入U形渠，相信已可预防病毒散播，不用倒漂白水，否则会严重污染环境。
In addition, daily water into the U-shaped canal, believed to prevent the spread of the virus, do not pour bleach water, otherwise will seriously pollute the environment.
”2月1日，深圳市第三人民医院透露：在某些新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎确诊患者的粪便中检测出2019-nCoV核酸（新型冠状病毒）阳性，可能提示粪便中有活病毒存在；同日，中国生态环境部亦印发相关文件，安排部署医疗污水和城镇污水监管工作，规范医疗污水应急处理、杀菌消毒要求，防止新型冠状病毒通过粪便和污水扩散传播。
On February 1, the Shenzhen Third People's Hospital revealed that 2019-nCoV nucleic acid (new coronavirus) positive in the feces of patients diagnosed with certain new coronavirus-infected pneumonia may indicate the presence of live virus in their feces.
U形水槽藏风险让香港人养成每逢疫病期间便抢购口罩及消毒水的源头，是2003年非典时期作为重灾区之一的淘大花园堪称“疫劫”的经历：淘大花园是香港特区一个大型私人住宅楼群，位于九龙观塘区的牛头角，因其前身是淘大食品的工场而得名。
The risk of U-shaped gutters gave Hong Kong people the experience of snapping up face masks and disinfecting water during epidemics. Taobao Garden, a large private residential complex in the Hong Kong SAR in Kwun Tong, Kowloon, was named after the factory that formerly panned for food.
该屋苑陆续建于1980年至1987年，1981年开始入住。
The estate was built from 1980 to 1987 and began to be occupied in 1981.
2003年2月，一位刘姓教授在出现肺炎症状（实为非典）后自行服用抗生素使病情好转，其于当月21日协同妻子到港参加外甥婚宴，入住酒店后造成16位酒店住客和访客受到感染。
In February 2003, a professor surnamed Liu took antibiotics on his own to relieve symptoms of pneumonia (SARS). He and his wife went to Hong Kong for a niece wedding dinner on February 21.
其中一名26岁香港居民曾到其入住过的酒店访友，随后出现发烧症状，在28日到威尔斯亲王医院急症室求诊，被诊断为呼吸道感染后出院返家。
A 26-year-old Hong Kong resident visited his hotel and developed fever. He was admitted to the Accident and Emergency Department of the Prince of Wales Hospital on 28 February and was discharged from the hospital after being diagnosed with respiratory infection.
3月4日返回急症室，并被安排入住8A病房，引致病房中多人被感染。
He returned to the Accident and Emergency Department on 4 March and was admitted to Unit 8A, causing many people in the ward to become infected.
对于后来被称为“淘大花园爆发严重急性呼吸系统综合症事件”聚集地的淘大花园来说，经《财经》记者查询得到的香港特区卫生署调查资料显示：其源头病人是一名当时33岁、经常到位于淘大花园探访其弟的男子。
In the case of the Taobao Garden, later known as the "Taobao Garden SARS Incident," a survey conducted by the Hong Kong SAR Department of Health, which was consulted by Caijing, revealed that the source was a 33-year-old man who visited his brother in the Taobao Garden.
该名病人患有慢性肾衰竭病，一直在威尔斯亲王医院接受治疗。
The patient suffers from chronic renal failure and has been treated at Prince of Wales Hospital.
2003年3月，他呈现严重病征。
In March 2003, he developed severe symptoms.
但在3月14日和3月19日仍曾到淘大花园E座一个由其弟拥有的单位，期间因肚泻而使用该单位的厕所。
However, on 14 March and 19 March, he went to a unit owned by his brother in Block E of the Taobao Garden, during which the toilet of the unit was used for diarrhea.
其后，他的弟弟、弟妇和两名在威尔斯亲王医院照料他的护士证实感染严重急性呼吸系统综合症。
Subsequently, his brother, his sister-in-law and two nurses attending to him at Prince of Wales Hospital confirmed that they were suffering from severe acute respiratory syndrome.
截至2003年4月15日，淘大花园共有321宗严重急性呼吸系统综合症个案。
As at 15 April 2003, there were 321 cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Amoy Garden.
感染个案明显集中在E座，占累积总数41%。
Infection cases were significantly concentrated in Block E, accounting for 41% of the cumulative total.
“凌晨四五点钟开始人声嘈杂，打开监控一看，外面都是穿着白衣服戴着口罩的人，大门一下子被封，整栋楼的人全都不能离开，所有住户搬进隔离营。
"The noise started at four or five in the morning, the surveillance was turned on, there were men in white and masks outside, the gates were sealed off, the whole building could not leave, and all the occupants moved into the quarantine camp.
有家人受感染的到麦理浩夫人渡假村观察，没病症的则到鲤鱼门军营。
Those with infected family members went to Lady MacLehose Holiday Village for observation and those with no symptoms went to Lei Yue Mun Barracks.
”一位曾经历过这一时期的居民对《财经》记者称。
A resident who has lived through this period told Caijing.
E座与淘大花园内其余各座楼宇一样，楼高 33 层，每层有八个单位。
Block E is the same as all other buildings in the Amoy Garden. It is 33 storeys high and has eight flats on each floor.
而每座楼宇都有八条直立式污水管收集污水。
Each building has eight vertical sewers to collect sewage.
这条污水管连接水厕、洗手盆、浴缸和浴室的地台排水口，它们各设有U形聚水器。
The sewer connects the floor drains of the toilet, sink, bathtub and bathroom, each equipped with a U-shaped water collector.
按照中国香港特区多个官方机构事后的联合调查显示：由于厕所、浴缸等经常使用，与其相连的U形聚水器大部分时间有水，并能发挥隔离作用。
The U-shaped water catcher, which is connected to toilets and bathtubs, has water for most of the time and acts as a barrier, according to a joint investigation by a number of government agencies in the territory.
但由于大部分住户清洁浴室地面时习惯采用拖把而非用水冲洗，导致连接地台排水口的U形聚水器可能因干涸未能发挥隔离作用。
However, because most households tend to use mop rather than water to clean the bathroom floor, the U-shaped water collector, which connects the floor drain outlet, may not be isolated by drying up.
按照相关调查，当浴室抽气扇启动后，空气会从污水管经地台排水口倒流进入浴室。
According to the relevant investigation, when the bathroom fan is activated, the air will flow back from the sewer through the floor drain into the bathroom.
推测是这些气流可能把存于污水管内的带病毒液散发至于室内及排放至相邻单位的天井，最终通过窗口进入相邻家庭。
It is assumed that these streams may spread the virulent venom stored in the sewers indoors and into the patio of the adjacent unit, and eventually enter the neighbouring family through the window.
因此，淘大花园相对完整的一条传染链条是：源头病人有可能首先通过E座的污水排放系统、人与人的接触以及大厦的公共设施（电梯及楼梯），使得单元楼内的一批住户感染病毒，然后再感染同座的其他住户。
Thus, a relatively complete chain of contagion from the Taobao Garden is that the source patient may first infect a group of households in the flat with the virus and then infect the other occupants of the same building through the sewer system of Block E, the person-to-person contact and the public facilities (elevators and stairs) of the building.
然后其可能通过人与人的接触及受污染的环境设施把病毒传播给E座内外的居民。
It may then transmit the virus to residents inside and outside Block E through human-to-human contact and contaminated environmental facilities.
淘大花园之后，为避免发生类似事件，中国香港特区政府已制定指引，教育市民如何位家居消毒，包括如何清洁浴室和维持U形聚水器的隔气作用（住户应至少每星期一次用约半公升清水倒入排水口，以确保U形聚水器或隔气弯管维持隔气功用）。
To avoid similar incidents, the HKSAR Government has formulated guidelines to educate the public on how to disinfect their homes, including how to clean bathrooms and maintain the isolation function of the U-shaped water converters (households should pour about half a litre of water into the drain outlets at least once a week to ensure that the traps are maintained).
此外，政府还印制了相关的指引，提醒市民须妥善保养及维修水渠系统及卫生设施。
Relevant guidelines have also been issued to remind the public to properly maintain and repair the drainage system and sanitary facilities.
该套指引被分发至物业管理公司及业主立案法团（类似于内地的业务委员会），有关资料亦可在相关政府网站上进行查询。
The guidebook is distributed to property management companies and owners' corporations (business committees similar to those in the Mainland). Relevant information can also be found on the relevant government websites.
更明显的标志，则是香港亦出现新型冠状病毒确诊病例后，不少住宅及商用楼内的电梯按键均被覆盖上了透明塑料薄膜，并重新用标签标注：每两小时消毒一次。
The most obvious sign of this is the presence of a new coronavirus in Hong Kong. The lift keys in a number of residential and commercial buildings have been covered with transparent plastic sheeting and re-labelled: disinfect every two hours.
今年防疫新压力无形的制度经验相对容易梳理及总结，但香港从2003年起至今仍未解决的“人多房少”的客观现实，则令香港不少人士担心其在面临各类新型病毒时的防疫压力。
This year's experience with the invisible system of epidemic prevention is relatively easy to disentangle and summarise. However, the fact that Hong Kong has not solved the problem of "multi-occupancy" since 2003 has caused many people in Hong Kong to worry about the pressure they face when facing new types of virus.
以淘大花园为例：因居住密度较高，其浴室面积也非常狭小（约3.5平方米），每当有人使用浴室时，关上的门及运行中的抽气扇能造成较强的负气压，驱使带病毒的小液滴通过地台排水口进入浴室，随后附着在各种物品的表面上，比如地毯、毛巾、洗手间用品等。
Taobao gardens, for example, have very small bathrooms (about 3.5 square metres) because of the high density of dwellings. Shut doors and running fans can cause negative air pressure whenever someone uses the bathroom, driving small droplets of virus through floor drains into the bathroom and then attaching to surfaces such as carpets, towels, toilet articles, etc.
“所以新建的楼盘或者进行翻修时，下水系统必须符合要求，加装‘反虹吸气阀’，以避免将U形聚水器的水吸走，增加细菌传入屋内的风险。
"So when a new building is built or renovated, the drainage system must meet the requirements and be fitted with a 'back siphon valve' to avoid sucking up the water from the U-shaped water accumulator, increasing the risk of bacteria entering the house.
”香港某物业管理员对《财经》记者表示，“所以一般家庭还好，更多的是其他家庭。
A property manager in Hong Kong told Caijing: "So the average family is fine, it's more other families.
”因人多地少造成的居住压力，亦造成了香港多年来存在大量居住在“房中房（㓥房，港称㓥房）”内的家庭。
The pressure of living in a small number of people has also contributed to the large number of families living in "condominiums" in Hong Kong for many years.
在过去十多年间，因种种原因限制，香港人烟稠密的市区旧楼内的㓥房总数比之2003年时有增无减。
For a variety of reasons, the total number of condominiums in older urban buildings in Hong Kong has increased over the past decade or so compared to 2003.
据中国香港特区政府统计处2016年中期的人口统计：全港约9.27万个㓥房，居住近21万人，平均一个单位分间成3.4个㓥房。
According to the by-census of the Census and Statistics Department of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in 2016, there were about 92,700 residential units housing nearly 210,000 people, with an average of 3.4 housing units per unit.
曾于2003年任香港工程师学会“抗炎专责小组”主席的一位人士在多年前便曾表示：部分㓥房需升高地台以加建独立厨厕，或涉违规改建，难保证其喉管是否合规及装有U形聚水器；部分㓥房厕所更不设窗户，空气不流通下恐增加传播病毒机率。
A person who chaired the Anti-inflammatory Task Force of the Hong Kong Institution of Engineers (HKIEd) many years ago said that some of the quilts required elevated ground level to provide additional independent kitchen toilets, or that irregular alterations would make it difficult to ensure proper plumbing and U-shaped water accumulators.
曾经历淘大花园爆发SARS事件的前中国香港特区政府屋宇署长邬满海也称：“最大问题是㓥得不合格的㓥房，以及政府如何跟进这类㓥房的排水系统”。
"The biggest problem is the problem of substandard housing and how the Government follows up on the drainage system of such houses," said Wu Man-hai, the former Director of Buildings of the Hong Kong SAR Government, who experienced the SARS outbreak in Amoy Garden.
㓥房之外，高层建筑高密度设计产生的“烟囱效应”及香港的高密度人群聚集将会给抗疫带来哪些影响，亦正在成为香港相关各界正在担心的话题：基于人口密度而不仅仅是流通量计算，香港的疫情，可能将会比北、上、深、广，甚至重庆更严重。
Outside the Cottage Area, the "chimney effect" of high-rise buildings and the high concentration of people in Hong Kong are becoming a growing concern in Hong Kong. Based on population density rather than just flux, the epidemic in Hong Kong may be more severe than that in North, Upper, Deep and even Chongqing.
按照人口密度计算，香港属世界上最高人口密度地区之一。
Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated areas in the world in terms of population density.
按照2018年香港按区议会分区划分的陆地面积，年中人口及人口密度统计（修订于2019年3月4日）则显示：香港陆上每平方公里的总人数为6890人。
According to the land area of Hong Kong by District Council District in 2018, the Mid-Year Population and Population Density Statistics (revised on 4 March 2019) shows that the total number of people per square kilometre on land in Hong Kong is 6,890.
因香港不少地区为保育用地或难以利用的棕地，按实际的居住地区计算，“香港有700多万人口，现时居住的地方有267平方公里，平均每平方公里的人口密度达27 000人……与香港人口密度可以相提并论的大城市，只有孟加拉达卡和印度孟买。
According to the actual residential area, "Hong Kong has a population of more than 7 million and lives on 267 square kilometres, with an average population density of 27,000 people per square kilometre... only Dhaka, Bangladesh and Mumbai, India, are comparable to Hong Kong's population density.
”原中国香港特区政府发展局局长曾在此前的一篇网志中指出。
In an earlier blog, the former Secretary for Development of the Hong Kong SAR Government pointed out.
从1月底至今，《财经》记者在香港特区几处热门购物区采访时发现：虽公共图书馆、泳池等公共设施已经暂停开放。
From the end of January to the present, Caijing reporters in a number of popular shopping areas in the HKSAR found that public facilities such as public libraries and swimming pools had been suspended.
路上的大量行人也已普遍戴上规格不一的各类口罩，但购物及餐饮的商铺生意仍相对兴隆。
A large number of pedestrians have also been wearing a wide variety of masks, but shopping and catering shops are still relatively prosperous.
截止2月2日中午12点，最新统计数据显示：中国香港特区新型冠状病毒确诊感染人数为14人，无死亡病例，亦无治愈出院病例。
As of 12 noon on February 2, the latest statistics showed that the number of people diagnosed with the new coronavirus in the Hong Kong SAR of China was 14.
防疫压力犹在，但形势尚未恶化。
The epidemic is still under pressure, but the situation has not worsened.
