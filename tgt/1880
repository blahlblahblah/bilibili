燃财经（ID:rancaijing）原创作者 | 金玙璠编辑 | 魏佳“如果不是因为疫情，我都忘了自己手机里还有摩拜APP，账户里还剩几十块钱余额。
"If it hadn't been for the outbreak, I would have forgotten that I still have a Motorola APP on my mobile phone and that there are dozens of money left in my account," says Ren Fan, editor and chief executive of Flaming Finance (ID: Rancaijing)
”随着春节假期结束，返工大幕逐渐拉开，越来越多的人从各地返回所工作的城市，免不了有通勤的烦恼，周昂就是其中一员。
Zhou was one of a growing number of commuters returning to their cities of work as the Spring Festival holiday drew to a close.
他告诉燃财经，从疫情扩散开始，自己就在发愁通勤问题怎么解决。
He told Flaming Finance that he had been worrying about commuting since the epidemic spread.
公共交通工具人多密闭，有交叉感染的风险。
Public transportation is crowded and closed, with a risk of cross-infection.
周昂看到网友分享的公共交通工具安全排序，按照感染风险从高到低排序，公交车＞地铁＞网约车/出租车＞自行车/共享单车，深以为然。
Zhou Ang saw the safety ranking of public transportation vehicles shared by netizens, ranking them according to the risk of infection from high to low.
住所距离公司9.5公里，单程骑行至少45分钟，他坚持选择共享单车出行。
Living 9.5 kilometers from the company and riding for at least 45 minutes one way, he insisted on sharing his bike.
“前几天北京大雪，我照样这么骑。
"I rode the same way the other day in Beijing with heavy snow.
”周昂表示。
"said Zhou.
因为疫情，共享单车以一种特殊的方式进入到人们的视野。
Because of the epidemic, sharing bicycles has come into view in a special way.
在新闻里，共享单车是“最后的交通工具”，是参与防疫封路的“小帮手”，这一角色的背后也映射出，一个过去几年里最大的风口，伴随巨头的分别整合逐渐退居二线。
In the news, shared cycling is "the last vehicle" and the "little helper" involved in cordon sanitaire, a role mirrored by the fact that one of the biggest tsunamis of the past few years has been the gradual retreat of the giant's separation.
经历了2019年，“两轮”战场回归理性：各城市“限制投放”，资本急踩刹车，企业开始关注变现；行业形势也更加明朗：阿里通过蚂蚁金服扶持的哈啰单车后来居上；美团吞下摩拜之后边消化、边吃下第二大市场份额；滴滴撇下ofo，手握小蓝单车和新品牌青桔单车两张牌，在这一年挤进前三。
After 2019, the "two rounds" of battle returned to reason: cities "limited investment," capital slammed on the brakes, companies began to focus on cash; the industry became clearer: Ali digested the second-largest market share after swallowing the mobbies; and dribbled down the top three cards, blue bikes and new brand of blueberries.
2020年已经开始，被疫情短暂唤醒的共享单车，能翻身吗？人们需要共享单车人们最需要共享单车的时候到了。
Can shared bikes, which have been briefly awakened by the epidemic, turn around in 2020? The time has come for people to share their bikes.
在疫情防控期间，部分城市减少或者暂停了公共交通的运营，特别是武汉市，从1月23日起，全市公共交通暂停，私家车不允许上路。
During the period of epidemic prevention and control, some cities reduced or suspended the operation of public transport, especially in Wuhan, where public transport was suspended and private cars banned from the city on January 23.
如今随着各地陆续进入复工状态，返岗人流增加，有关部门建议上下班优先选择私家车、步行或骑车上班，以防交叉感染。
Now, as people return to work and return to work, private cars, walking or bicycling are recommended as a priority to prevent cross-infection.
哈啰出行2月6日披露的大数据显示，1月8日至2月5日期间，包括广州、深圳、北京、上海在内的多个一二线城市，采购出行（超市、农贸市场等地点附近）骑行量占比上涨约5%，求医出行（开关锁距离各城市医院100米内）骑行量占比上升（广州提升约4%），同时，近一个月3公里以上的骑行量占比增加，透露出部分用户用共享单车替代了此前的出行方式。
Between January 8 and February 5, a number of first- or second-tier cities, including Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Beijing and Shanghai, reported an increase of about 5 per cent in cycling (near supermarkets, farmers' markets, etc.), and an increase in the proportion of patients travelling more than 3 kilometres per month (up about 4 per cent in Guangzhou).
武汉，也在哈啰出行披露的上述城市中。
Wuhan, also disclosed in the above-mentioned city of Hello.
哈啰单车武汉市城市经理马超表示，自从疫情发生后，共享单车调度量最大的地方从写字楼、商圈、交通换乘枢纽，调整到了医院、社区。
Ma Chao, the city manager of Wuhan city, said that since the outbreak of the epidemic, the areas with the largest number of shared bicycle schedules have been moved from office buildings, shopping areas, transportation and transfer hubs to hospitals and communities.
身穿防护服骑行的一线人员来源 / 受访者面对需求的变化，共享单车企业也加入了防疫战中，美团、哈啰、青桔等先后宣布，向防疫一线的医护人员及各类工作人员提供免费骑行服务，免费范围从武汉到湖北全省，如今扩展到了全国，并在各地街头发起了“无差别消毒”倡议，也就是说，一线运维人员对负责区域内所有单车进行消毒，不分品牌，不分颜色。
In the face of changing demand, cyclists from frontline sources / respondents joined the epidemic prevention campaign. Free rides were provided to medical staff and workers from Wuhan to Hubei province, and now to the whole country. In other words, frontline operators conducted disinfection of all bicycles in their areas of responsibility, regardless of brand or color.
“这次疫情，把共享单车两轮的优势凸显出来了，可能部分城市的订单量相比去年同期增长了，但因为更多的城市是长期防疫在家或停工停产的状态，城市出行的需求总量和共享单车的出行需求都是下降的。
"The epidemic has highlighted the advantages of two rounds of shared cycling, with orders rising in some cities compared to the same period last year, but because more cities are permanently protected from home or shut down, the total demand for urban travel and the demand for shared cycling are down.
”易观出行分析师孙乃悦告诉燃财经，疫情的出现，只能帮助共享单车在淡季（冬天）提升一定的订单量，但这样的利好不会持续太久。
Sun Nai-yue, an easy-to-get travel analyst, told Flaming Finance that the outbreak could only help share bicycle orders in the low season (winter), but the benefits won't last long.
她认为，出行和通勤是高度相关的，等到疫情结束，企业正式复工，人们会快速恢复原有的通勤方式。
She believes that travel and commuting are highly correlated, and when the epidemic is over and businesses return to work, people will quickly return to their old ways of commuting.
在全国范围运营的某共享电单车品牌的创始人对燃财经透露，“公司疫情期间的运营情况，和其他行业一样，惨淡。
"The company's operations during the epidemic, like those in other industries, were dismal," the founder of a nationally owned motorcycle brand told Flaming Finance.
”上海金融与法律研究院研究员刘远举则认为，疫情对共享单车行业的利好是更长期，也是更稳定的。
Liu Yuanjun, a researcher at the Shanghai Institute of Finance and Law, said the epidemic was a longer-term and more stable benefit for the sector.
“类似于现在的外卖、生鲜类的APP，疫情对共享单车的用户拉新是有帮助的，有一些新增用户会留存下来，甚至部分会变成重度用户。
"Similar to today's take-out, fresh APPs, the epidemic is helping users share bikes and some of the new users will be saved or even become heavy users."
因为每年冬天流感都会来，即便这次疫情结束，人们对自身健康的重视，对人群聚集甚至人与人接触的敏感，会长期持续。
Because the flu comes every winter, even when the epidemic is over, people's focus on their own health, their sensitivity to crowds and even people-to-people contact, will last for a long time.
”他对燃财经说。
'he said to Flaming Finance.
毫无疑问，疫情在客观上凸显了两轮出行的必要性，但利好会持续吗？疫情发生之前，这个行业发生的变化或许已经给出了答案。
There is no doubt that the epidemic objectively highlights the need for two rounds of travel, but will the benefits persist? Before the outbreak, changes in the industry may have given an answer.
涨价止损共享单车2019年最大的变化，毫无疑问是“变贵”。
The biggest change in 2019 is no doubt "getting more expensive."
从年初到年尾，用户先后经历了起步价上涨、计费规则调整、运营范围缩小等各种调整。
From the beginning to the end of the year, users have experienced a rise in the starting price, the adjustment of billing rules, the scope of operations and other adjustments.
2019年3月，滴滴运营的小蓝单车和青桔单车在北京引领首轮涨价潮，起步价由每30分钟1元调整为每15分钟1元，超出时长后每15分钟收费0.5元。
In March 2019, drip-dripping blue bikes and tangerine bicycles led the first-round price hike in Beijing, with the starting price adjusted from $1 per 30-minute cycle to $1 per 15-minute period and $0.5 per 15-minute overrun.
4月，摩拜单车、哈啰单车紧跟着也调整了起步价。
In April, Motorcycle and Hello Bicycle followed suit and adjusted their starting prices.
尽管引发部分用户不满，摩拜随后在上海、成都、深圳、北京等地仍继续提高起步价至1.5元，起步时长为30分钟，简单来说，就是骑行半小时1.5元，1小时3元，价格涨了三倍。
Despite some user dissatisfaction, the company continued to raise the starting price to 1.50 yuan in Shanghai, Chengdu, Shenzhen and Beijing, starting at 30 minutes, or, in simple terms, half an hour and a half, three yuan an hour and a three-fold increase in price.
11月、12月，青桔和哈啰继续跟进提价。
In November and December, orange and Hello continued to follow suit.
到2019年最后一个月，共享单车告别了ofo带来的每小时1元的历史，进入3元每小时的新时代。
By the last month of 2019, shared bikes have bade farewell to the $1-an-hour history of ofo, entering a new era of $3 per hour.
摩拜单车北京市运营范围来源 / 摩拜单车APP骑行价格一涨再涨外，违停收费、运营范围“缩水”也是行业的“常规操作”。
Bye-Bicycle Beijing Operating Range Source / Bike APP Cycling Price Rising, parking fees, operating scope "shrinkage" is also the industry's "normal operation.
对于平台而言，违停收费可以规范停放，降低运维成本。
For the platform, parking violation charges can regulate parking and reduce the operation cost.
对用户来说，违停收费可以理解，但同时缩小运营范围，就意味着骑车成本变高，如果骑出圈，需要付出额外的停车/调度管理费。
For users, pay-as-you-go fees are understandable, but reducing the scope of operations at the same time means higher cycling costs and additional parking / scheduling management costs if the rides are taken out of the cycle.
至于费用的标准，头部玩家尚未达成共识。
As for the cost standard, the head player has not yet reached consensus.
据燃财经了解，摩拜和哈啰两家明确规定，如果用户将车骑出运营区域，在运营区域外关锁，要被收取20元车辆管理费；青桔这项费用的标准是5元。
According to Flaming Finance, the two families have specified that if a user rides out of the operating area and locks off the operating area, they will be charged a $20 vehicle management fee; the rate for blueberries is $5.
与此同时，单车平台都开始推广月卡、季卡、半年卡业务，努力增加用户粘性。
At the same time, the cycle platform began to promote the monthly card, quarter card, half a year card business, try to increase user stickiness.
相较于单次起步价1.5元，月卡、季卡模式单次骑行价格仅为几毛钱。
Compared to a single starting price of $1.50, the monthly card, seasonal card model of a single ride price is only a few cents.
有媒体推论，如果按照此前摩拜单车官方宣布的超4000万活跃用户计算，即便只有50%的用户购买月卡（价格25元），回笼资金将达到5个亿，月卡、季卡等在某种程度上充当了融资工具的角色。
Media reports suggest that even if only 50% of users buy a monthly card (for $25), the cash will reach 500 million, using monthly cards, seasonal cards and so on as a financing tool, if only 50% of users buy them, according to media reports.
平台循序渐进涨价的背后，有小心试探用户反应的考虑，也是盈利压力下的必然选择。
Platform step-by-step price increases, there are careful user response considerations, but also profit pressure under the inevitable choice.
美团点评在2018年年度业绩财报中透露，自2018年4月4日收购摩拜以来，摩拜贡献的收入共计15.07亿元，亏损达45.5亿元，贡献了美团总亏损额的一半。
According to the 2018 annual results report, Moby has contributed $1.507 billion in revenue and $4.55 billion in losses since its acquisition of Mobay on April 4, 2018, accounting for half of the company's total loss.
折算下来，相当于收购后的九个月里，摩拜平均每月亏损5个亿。
That translates to an average monthly loss of $500 million in the nine months since the acquisition.
直到第二年，单车业务才慢慢从美团财报的重灾区中脱身，在美团点评2019年前三季度的财报中，单车业务营收状况的表述都是“经营亏损持续显著收窄”。
It wasn't until the next year that the bicycle business slowly emerged from the worst-hit areas of the U. S. group's earnings report for the first three quarters of 2019.
对于单车业务的经营状况，滴滴出行方面表示，小蓝单车&青桔单车的盈利预期很正向，除了用户骑行付费作为主要收入来源以外，也在做诸如广告等变现尝试。
AT THE Bicycle business, Little Blue Ride & amp; Blue & amp; amp; P; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & nbsp
哈啰单车则在2019年11月宣布，已经在100多个城市实现盈利。
Hello Bike announced in November 2019 that it had made money in more than 100 cities.
哈啰出行的CEO杨磊表示，“共享单车不单能赚钱，而且还能实现规模性的盈利。
"Sharing bicycles is not only profitable, but also profitable at scale," said Yang Lei, chief executive of Hello Travel.
”今后，共享单车定价是否还会上升？根据前瞻产业研究院统计数据，2018年，中国共享单车市场规模达178.2亿元左右，用户规模达到3亿人左右，2019年市场规模达236.8亿元，用户规模达到3.8亿人。
Will the price of shared bicycles increase in the future? According to the Institute for Advanced Industrial Research, China's share market reached about 17.82 billion yuan in 2018, with about 300 million users and a market of 23.68 billion yuan in 2019, with 380 million users.
也就是说，哪怕是在三巨头都提价之后，订单数量也没有明显减少。
In other words, even after the Big Three price increases, the number of orders has not significantly decreased.
刘远举告诉燃财经，目前的价格还是由竞争决定的，未来还有提价的空间。
Liu told Flaming Finance that the current price is still determined by competition, there is room for future price increases.
严监管下的自我觉醒共享单车经历的另一关键词是“变色”，而在这一轮更换新车的过程中，伴随着政府的强监管。
Another key word in the shared cycling experience under strict supervision is "discoloration," which is accompanied by strong government oversight during the new cycle.
行业发展初期，各路资本疯狂追逐，刮起了一场共享经济的“两轮”风暴，风口过后，街头无人管理的好车、坏车、废车，被集中“扔”到了全国各地的“单车坟场”。
At the beginning of the industry's development, all sorts of capital frantically pursue, blowing up a shared economy "two rounds" storm, after the wind tunnel, the streets of good cars, broken cars, scrap cars, were "thrown" into "bicycle cemeteries" all over the country.
不同城市相关部门陆续出台单车管理政策，有的地方为了遏制无序停放，现阶段禁止增加投放；有的地方竞标投放，允许符合要求的企业投放；对于已经投放的城市，政府督促单车企业给出管理方案，解决乱停放问题。
Relevant departments in different cities have successively issued policies on bicycle management, some of which prohibit more bicycles at this stage in order to curb disorderly parking. Some have put up local bids to allow enterprises to put their bicycles in line with the requirements.
其中上海从2018年已开始分季度考核共享单车企业，具体从运营服务水平、对接数据质量、管理响应速度等几个维度考核，结果直接决定企业下一年（2019年）被准入的车辆数量。
Among them, Shanghai has started to examine shared bicycle enterprises quarterly since 2018, specifically from the service level, docking data quality, management response speed and other dimensions, the result directly determines the number of vehicles admitted to the enterprise the next year (2019).
继2017年8月底的“禁投令”后，广州在2019年4月再度启动共享单车指标投放，成为第一个采用招投标模式配额的城市，招标的结果是老“玩家”摩拜竞得最大份额，哈啰、青桔借此机会进入广州市场，三家共同获得40万辆市场配额。
Following a ban at the end of August 2017, Guangzhou launched the Shared Bicycle Index again in April 2019, becoming the first city to adopt the bid model quota. As a result, the largest share of the bid was awarded to the old players, who took the opportunity to enter the Guangzhou market.
今年2月11日，广州首次公布对共享单车企业的服务质量考核结果，哈啰单车在2019年第四季度考核中得到第一名，因此获得1万辆配额奖励，即增至13万辆。
On February 11, 2008, Guangzhou announced for the first time the results of its service quality assessment for bicycle-sharing enterprises. As a result, Hello Bicycle won the first place in the fourth quarter of 2019 and was awarded a quota of 10,000, or 130,000.
北京则继续实行“限制增量，减量调控”的政策，如要求滴滴和美团按照现有报备投放车辆数的50%减量置换，并全部领回由各区集中清理存放的车辆。
For its part, Beijing has continued its policy of "limiting incremental and reducing controls," such as requiring drip and U.S. missions to be replaced by 50 per cent reduction in the number of vehicles currently reported for delivery, and full recovery of vehicles centrally cleared by the sectors.
对此，滴滴决定将总量25万辆小蓝单车，按照2：1的比例置换成青桔单车，摩拜方面将总量70万辆的橙色摩拜单车，减半置换成“美团黄”版单车。
In response, drop-by-drop decided to replace a total of 250,000 bluebikes with tangerine bicycles at a ratio of 2: 1, and a half-dozen orange motorbikes with the Amber version of the bicycle halved.
与滴滴类似，哈啰（2017年12月与永安行单车合并）就是以新车置换永安行旧车的方式，强势进入了北京一线市场。
Similarly to the droplets, Hello (merged with Wing On Bicycle in December 2017) is a strong entry into Beijing's first-tier market by replacing old Yongan cars with new ones.
深圳在采取“总量控制+指标分配”的机制后，拟定为共享单车管理立法，已于2019年12月举行“《互联网租赁自行车管理立法》听证会”。
Having adopted the mechanism of "total volume control plus target allocation," Shenzhen has already held a "Hearing on Legislation on Internet Riding Bicycle Management" in December 2019 for the purpose of legislating on shared bicycle management.
其中提到，经营者未经许可擅自投放或者超越许可规模投放的，未按规定及时清理乱停放车辆，或收回已经失去使用功能的，由城管和综合执法部门责令限期处理，处5万元以上10万元以下罚款；逾期不收回车辆的，城管和综合执法部门可以扣押相关车辆。
It is mentioned that if a business operator drops a vehicle without permission or exceeds the permitted scale and fails to clear the parked vehicles in time or reclaims functions that are no longer in use, the municipal administration and comprehensive law enforcement departments shall order the disposal of the vehicles within a specified time limit and impose a fine of between 50,000 yuan and 100,000 yuan.
配合自上而下的监管，各家单车企业也开始注重精细化运营，如利用大数据指导运营和调度，建立用户信用体系，对有二次以上违停行为的用户收取管理费或者扣信用分，与此同时，从汽车行业的停车应用方案中借鉴了一些解决方案，如推出禁停区、电子围栏、蓝牙停车解决方案、搭载北斗导航定位芯片的单车等，来改善停车管理。
With top-down regulation, bike companies are focusing on fine operations, such as using big data to guide operations and scheduling, establishing user credit systems, charging management fees or deducting credit points for users with more than two violations, while leveraging solutions from the automotive industry's parking applications, such as no-parking zones, electronic fencing, Bluetooth parking solutions and bikes with BeiDou navigation and positioning chips.
此前一位上海交通委相关负责人告诉燃财经，“谁先试点谁上新闻，这些对于企业来说，更多是做做曝光，企业只是应付政府，并不会实际投入太多，如果没有政府监管，企业很难有动力去做这些事。
Earlier, a Shanghai transport official told China Flaming Finance: "For companies, it's more of a publicity stunt than a government response. Without government regulation, it is hard for companies to have the incentive to do it.
”图 / 视觉中国在2019年行将结束之时，共享单车行业迎来一份新文件。
Figure / Vision China is nearing the end of 2019 with a new document for the shared cycling industry.
11月28日，北京市市场监督管理局发布了一份涉及共享单车行业的预付式消费管理征求意见稿。
On November 28, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Market Supervision issued an exposure draft on prepaid consumption management involving the shared bicycle industry.
这份征求意见稿具体规定了共享单车企业的用户押金和预付资金的上限，单份押金金额不得超过运营车辆平均单车成本的10%，单个用户账号预付资金额度不得超过100元；同时规定运营企业需采取备付金制度，备付金不得低于用户预付资金余额的40%，且用途只能是其主营业务，不得用于不动产、股权、证券、债券等投资及其他借贷用途等。
The exposure draft specifies a limit for user deposits and up-front funding for bicycle-sharing enterprises, which may not exceed 10 per cent of the average bicycle cost of the operating vehicle, or up to $100 for a single user account. It also stipulates that the operating enterprise must adopt a provisioning system of 40% of the user's prepaid fund balance and must not be used for real estate, equity, securities, bonds or other borrowing purposes.
此前5月份，交通运输部、人民银行等6部委联合印发的《交通运输新业态用户资金管理办法（试行）》，还对共享单车押金相关的其他流程作出了细致规范。
Earlier in May, the Ministry of Transport and Communications, the People's Bank and other six ministries jointly issued the Measures on the Management of Funds for Users of New Transport Businesses (Trial).
比如，当用户申请退还预付金时，经核对无误后应最迟次日按原路退还给用户，同时建立多部门联合工作机制来加强资金监管。
For example, when a user requests a refund of the advance payment, it should be returned to the user by the same route no later than the following day, and a joint multisectoral working mechanism is established to strengthen the supervision of funds.
与传统押金不同，共享单车的押金是按用户数而非单车数收取，且用户群体庞大，企业利用押金和充值款，可以迅速积累起巨额资金池。
Unlike a traditional deposit, a bicycle security deposit is based on the number of users rather than on the number of bicycles, and a large user base allows companies to rapidly accumulate large pools of capital using deposits and repayments.
同时，由于法律性质和监管不明确，押金变相具备融资功能，如果企业以此作为杠杆，用于后续的补贴或投入，或者其他经营活动，终将酿成大祸，ofo就是典型的案例。
At the same time, the deposit has a financing function because of its legal nature and lack of regulation, which is typically the case if the enterprise uses it as leverage for subsequent subsidies or inputs or for other operations.
如今，押金管理趋严，从整体来看，企业后续想再利用杠杆资金已很难。
Today, deposit management is tightening, from the overall perspective, it is difficult for enterprises to re-use leveraged funds.
挂靠巨头，是唯一出路吗？理性，已经成为全行业的关键词。
Relying on the giant, is the only way out? Reason, has become the keyword of the industry.
一级市场对共享单车市场的态度已经变冷。
Attitudes of the primary market to the shared bicycle market have cooled.
2019年，没有一家共享单车企业公开宣布获得投资。
In 2019, not a single cyclist publicly announced an investment.
只在2019年7月，传言哈啰出行获得蚂蚁金服领投的4亿美元融资，不过哈啰对此不予置评，该消息也成为当年创投圈的谜团之一。
In July 2019 alone, talk of Hello Kitty getting $400 million from Ant Gold was dropped from comment, making it one of the enigmas of the year.
共享单车行业的资本游戏玩到现在，市场格局逐渐明朗，存活到现在的头部三家，在2019年也不再单靠资本驱动扩充规模，而是注重运营和变现，同时积极配合政府监管。
By now, the market pattern has become clearer, with three now surviving and no longer capital-driven expansion in 2019, focusing on operations and liquidations, while actively working with government regulation.
在自证盈利能力的路上，头部三家不约而同走上了同一条路：并入大而全的平台生态体系之下，各自作为大平台出行布局中的一环，贡献流量和数据价值。
On the road to self-certification profitability, the three head coincidentally follow the same path: integration into a large and complete platform ecosystem, each contributing traffic and data value as part of a larger platform travel configuration.
这是行业的唯一出路吗？金沙江创投主管合伙人朱啸虎在评论共享电单车时表示，“这可以做成一个小而美的生意，挂靠在大平台之下，证明赚钱能力还是可以的。
"This could make a small but beautiful business," said Zhu Xiaohu, managing partner of Jinsha River, in commenting on the sharing of motorcycles.
”孙乃悦告诉燃财经，虽然共享单车行业发展时间只有五年，但多轮更新换代已经验证出，行业的优势是新用户获客成本低，老用户活跃度高，突出问题是资产过重，盈利能力较弱，单纯依靠租金难以盈利，出路就是必须依附于生态型企业，和大平台的其他业务形成互补，如带动平台的低频但是高收入的业务，体现流量和数据的价值。
Mr Sun told Flammai that although the sector had only been developing for five years, several rounds of upgrading had proven that the industry had the advantage of low customer acquisition costs, high old user activity, over-capitalized, less profitable and unprofitable simply by renting, and the need to be dependent on eco-businesses to complement other operations on the platform, such as low-frequency but high-income operations that drive the platform.
对于这一点，孙乃悦强调，用户在使用习惯上已经给出反馈——2019年一个未被放大的趋势是，越来越多用户从使用独立的APP转到在微信和支付宝的小程序上下单，2020年，这一趋势还将继续，支付宝、微信出行服务流量入口将继续小程序化。
On this point, Sun stressed that users were already giving feedback on their usage habits - an unamplified trend in 2019, with more and more users moving up and down from using stand-alone APPs to micromail and paypal apps, a trend that will continue in 2020, with pay-per-view and micro-mail traffic portals continuing to be streamlined.
据易观统计，2019年6月，仅38%的共享单车订单来自独立APP端，62%的订单来自小程序渠道（包括微信小程序和支付宝小程序），小程序已成为共享单车行业最大的流量入口。
According to Easy View statistics, in June 2019, only 38 per cent of shared bicycle orders came from stand-alone APPs, 62 per cent from small program channels (including micro-mail applets and paypal apps), and small programs had become the biggest traffic entrances to the shared cycle industry.

“相比一个独立的初创企业，挂靠在巨头底下，公司抗风险的能力，说直白一些就是现金流情况一定是更强的。
"Compared to an independent start-up, under a giant, the company's ability to withstand risk, to be blunt is that cash flow must be stronger."
”孙乃悦说。
'said Sun Nai-yue.
刘远举同样认为，只有挂靠巨头，共享单车企业才有实力在这次疫情期间大规模免费。
Liu also believes that only the giant, the shared bicycle companies have the strength to large-scale free of charge during the epidemic.
过去一年，共享单车的基调是，行业进一步规范，三大巨头划定势力范围，各自回归商业本质——赚钱。
Over the past year, the tone of shared cycling has been one of greater industry regulation, with the Big Three moving back to business - making money.
哈啰出行联合创始人李开逐2019年12月公开表示，哈啰单车在行业拿到了50%以上的市场份额。
Hello travel co-founder Lee Kai-chu publicly said in December 2019 that Hello Bicycle has a market share of more than 50% in the industry.
美团对现有秩序显然最为不满。
America is clearly the most unhappy with the existing order.
2019年对于美团而言，是急需自证盈利能力并将流量整合的一年，还没完全把摩拜“消化”透的王兴，一再强调，美团APP将成为摩拜唯一入口。
2019 has been a year of dire need for self-certification and traffic consolidation for the US mission, with Mr Wang, who has not yet fully digested Mr Moby, repeatedly emphasising that the APP will be the only entry point to Mobay.
在美团2019年Q3财报电话会议上，美团CEO王兴放话，单车业务是明年的投资重点。
At the 2019 Q3 earnings conference call, U. S. CEO Wang Xingfang, bicycle business is the focus of next year's investment.
美团这一决定势在必行。
This decision of the American Mission is imperative.
在刘远举看来，美团APP作为唯一的骑行入口，利于完善在用户心智当中的定位，还能在出行领域和滴滴扛一扛，让用户一想到出行，就想到覆盖“吃喝玩乐行”的美团，同时还能给其他业务引流，否则，摩拜作为一个单独的APP，在出行领域的竞争力无法与对手相比。
In Liu's view, the APP is the only way to improve the user's position in the mind. It can also be used in the travel field, and make users think of travel as a group that covers "food, drink and play," as well as other businesses.
刘远举认为，虽然同在共享经济阵营里，但是共享单车和网约车、共享汽车有很大的不同，后两者可以共享运力，较难长期保持寡头竞争，市场份额还有扭转的空间，但是共享单车的特殊性在于需要投入大量的硬件和运营成本，市场份额不会有较大的变动，寡头竞争相对而言更加稳定，因此比其他行业更快速进入理性竞争的阶段。
While sharing bikes with netters and cars is very different, with the latter sharing capacity, less competition from oligarchies in the long run and more room for reversal, Liu argues that sharing bikes is unique in that it involves significant hardware and operational costs, no significant market share changes and relatively stable oligopolistic competition, thus moving faster into rational competition than other industries.
多位行业人士一致认为，2020年共享单车行业，不会出现太多变化，看点是各家如何把自家资产盘活。
Many in the industry agree that there will not be much change in the 2020 cycling sector, depending on how households turn their assets around.
