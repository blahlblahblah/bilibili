志愿者们每天都要开会，商讨工作中遇到的问题。
Volunteers meet every day to discuss problems at work.
比如有人提出，电商平台尽量不要在晚上送菜，以便居民尽快吃到订购的各种食品；针对订单上用户名和电话号码不完整的情况，有人提出要和电商平台沟通，让他们提供完整信息。
For example, it has been suggested that e-commerce platforms try not to deliver food at night so that residents can eat as much of the ordered food as possible; in response to incomplete usernames and telephone numbers on orders, it has been suggested that the e-commerce platform be contacted for complete information.
沟通两三次后，这个问题真的解决了。
After communicating two or three times, the problem was really solved.
志愿者为居民们分菜、送菜。

26岁的肖安康站在窗前，拿着手机在微信群里说：“今天变天了，还是多让年轻的志愿者送菜吧。
"It's changing today, so let the young volunteers deliver," said Xiao Ankang, 26, standing at the window with his cell phone in his hand.
”肖安康是湖北省十堰市张湾区国瑞蓝山郡小区的居民，也是业主志愿者队的一员。
"Xiao Ankang is a resident of Guorui Lanshan County, Shiyan City, Hubei Province, and a member of the Volunteer Owners' Team.
2月初以来，他每天都会为被封闭小区内的居民分发网购来的蔬菜。
Since the beginning of February, he has been distributing online vegetables to residents of the closed areas on a daily basis.
2月12日，十堰市发出了《张湾区全域实施战时管制的紧急通告》，让这个位于湖北省西北部、鄂豫陕三省交界的小城备受关注。
February 12, Shiyan City issued "Zhang Wan region-wide implementation of wartime control emergency notice," so that the province in the northwest of Hubei Province, Hubei Province at the junction of the three provinces of attention.
按照十堰市张湾区新冠肺炎疫情防控指挥部的要求，自当日24时起，区内全域实施“战时管制”，以14天为一周期，根据全市及张湾区疫情防控的效果，提前解除或持续实施管制。

据张湾区蓝山郡社区负责人关军介绍，早在1月24日，十堰就封闭了进城、出城的公路，两天后蓝山郡小区也开始封闭。
As early as January 24, Shiyan closed the road into and out of the city, and two days later the small area of Blue Mountain County began to close, said Guan Jun, chief of the Blue Mountain community in Zhangwan District.
从那时起，小区内便建立起了一支将近50人的居民志愿者队伍，每天为小区内人员登记健康信息、为居民分菜送菜、在门口站岗。
Since then, a team of nearly 50 resident volunteers has been set up in the small district to register health information, distribute food to residents and stand guard at the gates on a daily basis.
依靠他们，上千个家庭、近五千名居民的日常生活才能正常运转。
Thanks to them, the daily lives of thousands of families and nearly 5,000 residents can function normally.
而“战时管制”后，志愿者们的任务更加繁重。
After "wartime control," the task of volunteers became even more onerous.
“战时管制”的小区2月15日中午12点，正准备回家吃饭的肖安康收到了志愿者同伴的微信：又来了一车（菜）。
At 12 noon on Feb. 15, Xiao Ankang, who was preparing to return home for dinner, received a message from a fellow volunteer: Another load.
在10幢1单元楼下，他按响了3101室的门铃，“喂，请您下来拿菜。
At the bottom of unit 1, he rang the doorbell in room 3101. "Hey, please come down and get the dishes.
”2月12日晚，十堰市张湾区新冠肺炎疫情防控指挥部（下称“张湾区指挥部”）发布《张湾区全域实施战时管制的紧急通告》（下称《战时管制通告》），共列出8项条款，其中最受关注的是第三条：所有楼栋一律全封闭管理，除抗疫、保障民生人员，居民不得出入；生活必需物资，通过配送或代购实现。

肖安康等人居住的国瑞蓝山郡小区位于张湾区。
Xiao Ankang and others live in Guorui Lanshan County small area in the Zhangwan District.
社区负责人关军说，小区内共有14栋楼，大部分楼栋是33层，一层5户；《战时管制通告》生效后，每个楼栋外的玻璃门都被锁上了。
The community chief, Guan Jun, said there were 14 buildings in the area, most of them 33 storeys and 5 on the ground floor. After the Wartime Control Circular came into effect, glass doors outside each building were locked.
每天早晚的规定时间内，医护人员，医药物资从业人员，从事抗疫公务人员，以及水电油气、通讯网络、粮食蔬菜等保障基本生活从业的人员（下称“四类人员”），可以拿着红色的通行证进出，此外任何人没有特殊情况都不能出入。

“志愿者守着门检查证件，查一个，放行一个。
The volunteers keep an eye on the door, check one, release one.
”关军说。
"said Guan Jun.
志愿者们在小区门口站岗。
Volunteers stood guard at the gate of the community.
受访者供图普通居民的日常需要，基本依靠附近几个超市的微信小程序解决，可以网购蔬菜、生活用品，菜品种类齐全，连雨衣、保鲜膜等小物件都可以买到。
Respondents to the daily needs of ordinary residents, basically rely on a few nearby supermarket micro-small procedures, can buy vegetables, daily necessities, a full range of dishes, even raincoat, plastic film and other small items can be bought.
超市把商品送到小区后，女志愿者们负责分拣、打电话通知居民，男志愿者们用手推车把东西送到每栋楼下，依次按门铃，叫各户居民下楼领取。
After the supermarket delivered the goods to the neighborhood, the women volunteers sorted and telephoned the residents. The men took the items downstairs in wheelbarrows, rang the doorbell and told the families to go downstairs to collect them.
“为了避免交叉感染，我们都是送完一户再按下一户。
"In order to avoid cross-infection, we are all going through one household and pressing the next.
”肖安康说。
'he said.
50岁的于萍住在5号楼，是东风汽车集团有限公司的退休员工，也是一名志愿者。
Yu Ping, 50, lives in Building 5 and is a retired employee of Dongfeng Motor Group Ltd., a volunteer.
封楼后，她拿着居委会提供的电话簿，挨个给5号楼所有的业主打电话、加微信，还拉起了一个楼栋微信群。
After the building was sealed, she took the telephone directory provided by the neighborhood committee, called all the owners of Building 5 one by one, added a micro-credit group to the building.
居民们每天要在微信群里汇报健康情况，于萍收集信息后上报给社区。
Residents report their health in a microphone group every day, and Ping collects information and reports it to the community.
她不太会用电脑，拿着笔和本子手写记录。
She doesn't know much about computers and writes notes with pens and notebooks.
“社区说过几天要搞一个程序，让大家可以在手机上填报，就不用那么麻烦了。
"The community said it would take a few days to get a program that people could fill in on their phones so they wouldn't have to bother.
”封楼后，于萍发现楼里住了两户独居老人，其中一户还做过肾移植手术，他们不会用手机买菜。
After the building was sealed, Yu Ping found two single elderly people living alone in the building, one of whom had a kidney transplant and would not buy food on her mobile phone.
于萍跑去敲门，站在门口和老人商量买菜、买日用品的事。
Yu Ping ran to knock on the door, and stood at the door to discuss with the elderly to buy vegetables, groceries.
因为志愿者可以进出楼栋，于萍决定自己替老人去超市、药店采购，“我把电话留给了他们，可以随时找我。
Because the volunteers can enter and leave the building, Yu Ping decided to go shopping for the elderly people to the supermarket, pharmacy, "I left the phone to them, can always find me.
”小区封闭后招募志愿者1月24日，农历大年三十，十堰市开始封闭公路、停运公交。
Volunteer recruitment after the closure of the quarter January 24, Lunar New Year 30, Shiyan City began to close roads, stop public transport.
两天后，市新冠肺炎防控指挥部发布第14号通告，要求各小区业主“尽量减少进出，无特殊原因（因病就医、重要岗位上岗等）不得进出”。
Two days later, the Crowne Pneumonia Control Command issued Circular No. 14, which requires small district owners to "minimize access without any special reason (medical treatment, important duties, etc.)."
从1月24日起，关军和一名网格员便忙碌起来，他们两人要同时管理包括国瑞蓝山郡在内的两个小区，居民加起来有七八千人。
From January 24 onwards, customs and a grid man became busy, both of them to manage two small areas, including Guoru Bluanshan County, with a combined population of seven or eight thousand.
关军的工作内容很庞杂，要登记居民健康档案、排查武汉回流人员，要为家里有婴幼儿的居民买奶粉，要为不会网购的老人送菜、送药。
The work of the Guan Jun is very complex, to register residents health records, screening Wuhan Reflux personnel, to buy milk powder for residents with infants at home, to send vegetables and medicines to elderly people who do not buy online.
“最多的一天，我给20户送过菜，晚上回家还要给那些从武汉回来的人家打电话。
"On the biggest day I served food to 20 families and at night I had to call the families who had come back from Wuhan.
”1月26日，不堪重负的关军开始通过业主委员会微信群招募志愿者，希望有人帮忙买菜送菜、排查居民体温，“一开始只招了七八个”。
On January 26, overburdened customs began recruiting volunteers through the owners' committee micro-groups in the hope that someone would help them buy food and deliver food and check the residents' temperature.
不过接下来的几天，加入志愿者行列的居民一天比一天多了起来，2月5日左右已有20多人，“现在加上就近下沉服务基层的在职党员，志愿者总共有40多人了。
Over the next few days, however, more and more people joined the ranks of volunteers, more than 20 on or about February 5. "Now, with active members at the local community-level sinking service, there are more than 40 volunteers.
”关军说。
"said Guan Jun.
44岁的鲍勤勇是1月27日成为志愿者的。
Mr. Bao, 44, became a volunteer on January 27.
他是张湾区委组织部的一名公务人员，在蓝山郡住了一年多。
He is a member of the Organizational Department of the Zhang Wan District Committee and has lived in Blue Mountain County for more than a year.
新冠肺炎疫情之前，他就是张湾区的注册志愿者，“有重大疫情的时候，我们会直接冲上去，这很正常。
Before the outbreak, he was a registered volunteer in the Zhangwan area. "When there is a major outbreak, it is normal for us to rush directly.
”于萍是2月5日加入的。
Yu Ping joined on February 5.
她本来就是个热心肠，去年还报名参加了小区业委会的筹备组。
She was a warm-hearted person and signed up for the preparatory group for the neighborhood committee last year.
但因为今年1月中旬去过武汉，她回到十堰后先在家自行隔离了20天，确定身体没问题后加入了志愿者队。
But after visiting Wuhan in mid-January, she returned to her home in Shiyan and isolated herself for 20 days, making sure she was in good shape to join the volunteer team.
志愿者将居民的包裹转移到救灾帐篷中。
Volunteers transferred residents' parcels to relief tents.
受访者供图刚开始工作，鲍勤勇被分到了“劝导岗”。
The interviewee offered to begin work. Bao was assigned to the "persuasion post."
正月初三是蓝山郡封闭的第二天，清晨6点，天才微微亮，鲍勤勇就起床洗漱了。
The third day of the first month is the blue mountain county closed the second day, 6 a.m., genius slightly bright, Bao Qin Yong got up to wash gargle.
吃过早饭，他用温度计给自己测了体温——正常，之后便穿着志愿者的红色背心、戴上口罩、拎着酒精出门了。
After breakfast, he took his temperature with a thermometer - normal, and then went out in the volunteers' red vests, masks, and alcohol.
小区封闭后四个大门关了三个，只有正中间的大门通行，鲍勤勇和几名志愿者就守在这里，依次检查出入人员的证件。
After the closure of the four doors closed three, only the middle of the gate through, Bao Guanyong and a few volunteers on guard here, in order to check the people in and out of the document.
早上7:30-8:30是“四类人员”上班的高峰期，需要出门上班的人拿着一张张写有姓名、身份证号、联系方式和单位的通行证，在唯一开放的大门前排起了队。
People who need to go to work stand in line at the only open door with a pass with a name, identity number, contact details and work unit.
为了防止潜在的交叉感染，人与人之间要相隔两三米。
In order to prevent potential cross-infection, people should be separated by two or three metres.
早高峰过后，“四类人员”依旧可以出门，但人数少了很多，小区门口不再需要那么多志愿者。
After the early peak, "four categories of people" can still go out, but the number of people is much less, the community door no longer need so many volunteers.
鲍勤勇便开始在小区内巡逻，劝导那些在外闲逛的居民回家。
Bao began to patrol the area, advising the residents to return home if they wandered away.
鲍勤勇说，刚开始的一段时间，居民每户每三天可以出小区买菜一次。
Bao said that at the beginning of a period of time, every three days residents can out of the community to buy vegetables.
许多大爷大妈不愿遵守规定，刚出去买完白菜，半小时后又想出去买萝卜。
Many aunts are unwilling to abide by the rules, just out to buy cabbage, half an hour later would like to go out to buy radishes.
鲍勤勇觉得，他们是太孤独了，“子女不在身边，就想出门溜达找人聊天。
Bao felt that they were too lonely. "When their children were not around, they wanted to go out and talk.
”他会和这些大爷大妈聊上几句，手把手教他们网上购物。
He would talk to the great-great-great-aunt and teach them to shop online.
遇上出门遛狗、晒太阳的人他也要劝解，让大家尽量不出门，至少不能扎堆，避免交叉感染。
If you walk your dog or bask in the sun, try not to go out, at least not pile up, to avoid cross-infection.
“大部分人都是理解的，可耐不住也有一些调皮捣蛋的。
"Most people understand, but they can't bear to be naughty.
”关军就遇到过不配合的居民。
Guan Jun encountered uncooperative residents.
一次他在门口站岗，一个没戴口罩的小伙子忽然从楼上跑了下来，还踢开了门口的桌子，准备冲出小区。
Once he stood guard at the door, a young man without a mask suddenly ran down the stairs, kicked open the door of the table, ready to rush out of the community.
关军和志愿者报了警，警察来后，小伙子才说是自己和女朋友吵架了，“电话里说不清，要当面解决”。
Guan Jun and volunteers reported to the police, the police arrived, the young man said that he and his girlfriend quarreled, "the phone can not say, to face-to-face solution."
志愿者给了他一个口罩，为他进行半天心理疏导，终于把他劝了回去。
Volunteers gave him a mask, for a half-day psychological counseling, he was finally persuaded back.
摸着石头过河从志愿者队成立开始，蓝山郡就建立起了一套灵活的会议机制。
Starting with the establishment of the volunteer corps, a flexible set of meetings has been set up in Blue Mountain County.
每天下午四五点送完菜，大家会在小广场集合讨论一天的工作，谁遇到了什么问题，大家一起讨论解决方案，每个人都要发言。
At the end of each afternoon, people would gather in a small square to discuss the day's work, who had any problems, we would discuss solutions together, and everyone would take the floor.
“有时晚上躺在床上也会在微信群里讨论。
"Sometimes when I lie in bed at night I talk in a small group.
”关军说。
"said Guan Jun.
肖安康是一名退伍军人，在机场从事消防工作，2月初被分到“分菜组”后，就经历了摸着石头过河、不断调整工作方案的过程。
"Xiao Ankang, a veteran who worked in the airport as a fire brigade, was assigned to the" food division "in early February and went through a process of feeling the rocks and constantly adjusting the work programme.
1月26日小区封闭后，大部分居民要在微信小程序上买菜。
When the neighborhood was closed on January 26th, most residents had to buy food on micromail programs.
本地电商平台会把居民订购的蔬菜、水果、日用品等以订单为单位打包成袋、贴上订单标签，之后送到小区内的小广场上，一天就有300多袋。
Local electronic commerce platforms will pack vegetables, fruits, household goods, etc. ordered by residents into bags, affixed with order labels, and then deliver them to small squares in the district, where there are more than 300 bags a day.
居民会等着志愿者的电话通知，然后再来各自取菜。
Residents wait for a call from the volunteers and then come back to pick up the dishes.
为防止扎堆取菜时潜在的交叉感染，志愿者会为每一位取菜人翻找包裹，很耗时间。
To prevent potential cross-infection while packing, volunteers rummage through the bags for each pickup, which can take time.
“分菜组”成员杨旭记得，2月5日晚，平台把菜送来时天已经黑了，下着小雨还有点冷，为了避免蔬菜被淋湿，4名志愿者把包裹搬到了临时搭起的帐篷里。
Yang Xu, a member of the division, remembers that it was dark on the night of February 5 when the terrace delivered the dishes and it was still a bit cold with the drizzle.
有人来取菜时，他们要用手机打光一份一份地翻拣，非常麻烦。
When someone comes to pick up the dishes, they have to use the mobile phone to pick up every copy, very troublesome.
“还有一个问题是很多人下单时不用真名，订单标签上的电话又只能看到前三位和后四位。
"Another problem is that many people don't use their real names when placing orders, and only the top three and the bottom four are visible on the order labels.
”肖安康说，那段时间经常出现包裹下单后几天没人领取的情况，“我们又找不到人。
Mr. Shaw says it was a time when parcels were often left unclaimed for a few days. "We couldn't find anyone.
”为了解决这些问题，志愿者们开始在每天的广场例会或微信群会中商讨对策。
To solve these problems, volunteers began discussing strategies at daily squares or micro-groups.
比如有人提出，电商平台尽量不要在晚上送菜，以便居民尽快取菜，当天就能吃到订购的各种食品；针对订单上用户名和电话号码不完整的情况，有人提出要和电商平台沟通，让他们提供完整信息。
For example, it has been suggested that e-commerce platforms try not to deliver food at night so that residents can pick up food as soon as possible and can eat all kinds of food ordered on the same day. In response to incomplete usernames and telephone numbers on orders, it was proposed to communicate with the e-commerce platform for complete information.
沟通两三次后，这个问题真的解决了。
After communicating two or three times, the problem was really solved.
封楼后，志愿者会将居民从网上订购的包裹放上手推车，挨个送到楼下。
After the building was sealed, volunteers would put bags ordered online into wheelbarrows and send them downstairs one by one.
受访者供图肖安康有自己的想法，他希望提高分菜、取菜的效率。
The interviewee provided Tushao Ankang with his own ideas, and he hoped to improve the efficiency of food sharing and pickup.
他说要为每天送进社区的几百袋蔬菜“编号”，再按照编号顺序把蔬菜在广场上一排一排摆好，志愿者给居民打电话或发短信时也要告诉他们各自的菜品编号。
He said he would "number" the hundreds of veggies he brought into the community every day, and arrange the vegetables in a row in the square in numerical order. Volunteers would tell residents their food numbers when they called or texted.
“这样的话，你来取菜的时候告诉我你是100号，我很快就可以在一排一排的菜堆里挑出你家的那份。
"In that case, when you come to pick up the dishes, tell me you're number 100 and I'll be able to pick out your share in a row in a row.
”杨旭说，他们会把挑好的蔬菜放到几米外的空地上，请居民核对信息后自行取走，“不会直接递给他们，不会有直接接触。
Yang Xu said they would put the selected vegetables on a vacant lot a few meters away and ask residents to check the information and pick it up themselves.
”杨旭说，有时单日的包裹会突然增多。
'Sometimes packages increase abruptly in a single day, 'says Mr. Yang.
有志愿者开会时便提议，根据不同的平台把包裹分堆后再各自编号，“这样速度会快很多”。
When volunteers meet, they propose that the packages be stacked up according to different platforms and numbered separately. "This will be much faster."
除了分菜，其他问题也会通过类似机制摸索解决。
In addition to the division of dishes, other issues will also be explored through similar mechanisms.
“比如统计健康信息表，最开始是大家在居民微信群里以接龙的方式回复。
"Statistical health information sheets, for example, started as a response in the form of a" pick-up "message from residents.
”肖安康说，一个居民微信群里有100多户，每户都要接龙回复“健康，体温正常”等，信息会卡，刷屏速度极快。
"Xiao Ankang said there were more than 100 households in a microphone group, each receiving a response such as" healthy, normal body temperature, "and a message card that quickly scans the screen.
“后来有人提出可以用填问卷的微信小程序来登记，一下就解决了。
"It was then suggested that it could be registered with a micro-program that filled out the questionnaire, and that was settled immediately.
”封楼后任务加码随着新冠肺炎疫情不断变化，十堰市内的管制力度越来越强。
With the new crown pneumonia epidemic constantly changing, Shiyan City after the task is more and more powerful control.
2月12日晚，张湾区指挥部发布了《战时管制通告》，其中写道“这是非常时期、非常之举，势在必行、迫不得已。
On the night of February 12, Regional Command Zhang Wan issued a "Wartime Regulation Proclamation," which reads: "This is an emergency, an extraordinary event, a necessity and a necessity.
”张湾区副区长、区防指副指挥长肖旭表示，张湾区不是十堰市疫情最严重的地区，此举是为了巩固强化阶段性成果，“防止形成二代、三代传染”。
Zhang Wanchai was not the worst hit area in Shiyan City, said Xiao Xu, deputy district governor and deputy district commander of the district defence index, adding that the move was intended to consolidate the gains and "prevent the formation of second and third generation transmission."
据新京报此前报道，在中国政法大学应急管理法律与政策研究基地主任林鸿潮看来，依据宪法规定，只有全国人大、全国人大常委会可以宣布进入战争状态，只有战争状态才能采取战时管制措施，张湾区的所谓“战时管制”缺乏法律依据。
According to the Beijing News, Lin Hongchao, director of the Emergency Management Law and Policy Research Base at the Chinese University of Political Science and Law, said that only the NPC and the NPCSC can declare a state of war and only a state of war can take wartime control measures.
北京大学法学院教授王锡锌此前接受新京报记者采访时则表示，“战时”并非准确的法律称谓，是应急管理体制的一种表述。
Wang Xizin, a professor at Peking University Law School, told the Beijing News that "wartime" was not an accurate legal title and was an expression of the emergency management system.
对于蓝山郡的居民来说，“战时管制”开始后，小区内14栋楼的楼门很快被锁了起来。
For residents of Blue Mountain County, 14 buildings were quickly locked after "wartime control" began.
最近几天，关军最大的困扰是为进出楼栋的人员开门。
In recent days, the biggest worry has been opening doors for people entering and leaving the building.
1月26日小区封闭后，“四类人员”拿着通行证就可以进出小区，小区只有一个大门。
January 26 after the closure of the community, "four categories of people" with permits to enter and leave the small area, there is only one door.
但现在楼栋也封闭了，每天都要有人在各个门栋前开门、锁门。
But now the building is closed, and doors are locked and locked every day in front of them.
“针对‘四类人员’上下班的问题，我们本来规定他们早7:30-8:00、晚6:00-6:30集中出行，由志愿者在楼下值守，确认通行证后放行。
"For the four categories of people getting to and from work, we would have required them to travel intensively from 7.30 a.m. to 8.00 p.m. and from 6.00 p.m. to 6.30 p.m., with volunteers on duty downstairs to confirm their passes and then release them
但实际上大家的出行时间并不统一，进楼、出楼的时间也不固定。
But actually everybody's traveling time is not unified, enters the building, the building time also is not fixed.
”关军说，而整个小区的楼栋钥匙一共只有4套，为了严格、统一的管理，全部放在物业公司保安队长和几名社区人员手里。
"Guan Jun said that the entire block of buildings only four sets of keys, for strict, unified management, all placed in the hands of the property company security chief and several community members.
“所以每次有人在规定时间之外进出，我们就得来回跑。
"So every time someone walks in and out of the allotted time, we have to run back and forth.
”2月13日早上五六点，关军的电话就响了，有人要出门上班，他马上起床跑去开门。
At five or six o'clock in the morning of the 13th of February the telephone rang, and some one had to go out to work; he got up immediately and ran to open the door.
当晚7点-9点的高峰期，他至少往各个门栋跑了50次，“我也跑，保安队长也跑，我们几个分头跑，跑得我腿疼。
At the 7-9 p.m. peak, he made at least 50 runs to various doors. "I ran, so did the guard, and we ran separately, causing my leg to hurt.
”关军有点吃不消了。
The customs were a little too much.
2月14日，他向这些需要出门的居民建议，能不能请单位暂时帮他们安排住宿，等疫情结束再回来？“当然，我们也只是建议而已。
On February 14, he suggested to the residents who needed to leave their homes that they should be offered temporary accommodation until the outbreak was over.
”关军说。
"said Guan Jun.
“战时管制”后小区封楼，志愿者们在户外休息。
"Wartime control" after the closure of the community, volunteers in the open air rest.
受访者供图《战时管制通告》发布前的那天下午，肖安康就从微信群里听到了风声。
On the afternoon before the publication of the Wartime Control Circulars, Mr Shaw had heard the news from the microphone crowd.
他才提出不久的编号分菜方案，一下子失效了。
He just put forward a new number division plan, and all of a sudden, it failed.
因为封楼后，居民无法再到小广场取菜。
After the building was sealed, residents could no longer go to the square to pick up food.
志愿者们决定，从13日起菜要送到每户楼下，杨旭还从超市借了五六辆手推车。
The volunteers decided to bring food downstairs from the 13th, and Yang Xu borrowed five or six wheelbarrows from the supermarket.
除了开楼门、分菜送菜等事务，为燃气卡充值一类的日常琐事也变得无法完成。
In addition to building doors, food distribution and other matters, gas card charges such as daily chores become impossible to complete.
一名志愿者透露，2月13日“封楼”第一天，便有许多居民反映燃气快用尽了，需要去银行充值。
On February 13, the first day of the building, many residents reported running out of gas and needed to go to the bank to recharge, a volunteer said.
在讨论小区工作的微信群里，一名志愿者认为这项工作应由物业公司负责，物业却认为应该交给志愿者。
In a microphone group discussing community work, one volunteer suggested that the job should be done by a property company, but the property should be given to volunteers.
那天十堰最高温度19度，到了下午，在外忙碌了大半天的志愿者几乎都满身大汗。
The maximum temperature of Shiyan was 19 degrees that day, and in the afternoon, volunteers who had been working outside for most of the day sweated heavily.
杨旭不愿看到大家互相推诿，决定自己跑趟银行，为居民充值。
Not wanting to see people prevaricate, Yang Xu decided to run to the bank to recharge the residents.
2月14日上午，杨旭从每栋楼的负责志愿者处拿到了120户居民的燃气卡，按楼栋号分开，用纸包好，装进了一个酒盒子。
On the morning of February 14, Yang Xu got 120 gas cards from volunteers in each building, separated by building numbers, wrapped in paper and packed in a wine box.
他在银行排队了两小时，终于为所有燃气卡充值完毕。
