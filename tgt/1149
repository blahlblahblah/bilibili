Interviewees for the Beijing News reporter Xiao Wei Wei editor Hu Jie proofreading Zhao Lin February 11 evening, Wuhan Qingshan Industrial Road, the temperature close to zero degrees Celsius.
昏黄的路灯下，穿防护服、戴口罩的吴悠提着一个黑色塑料袋等在路边，塑料袋里装着几盒奥司他韦、莫西沙星、连花清瘟和一瓶酒精，这是一个在家隔离的新冠肺炎病人三天的用药量。
Wearing protective clothing and a mask under a yellow street lamp, Wu Yo carried a black plastic bag containing boxes of oseltamivir, moxifloxacin, rinderpest and a bottle of alcohol, a three-day dose of medicine for a home-isolated patient with Newcastle pneumonia.
一束电瓶车灯光出现在路口，骑车的女士接过塑料袋，说了几句感谢。
A bunch of electric car lights appeared at the intersection, the woman bike took the plastic bag, said a few words of thanks.
她停留了不到20秒，又骑车消失在夜色里。
She stayed for less than 20 seconds, then cycled her way out of the night.
疫情之下，对于有购药需求的居家隔离人员和隔离点患者来说，买药变得困难，在网上紧急求助的帖子数以万计。
With the epidemic, buying drugs has become difficult for homebound quarantine and quarantine patients who need it, with tens of thousands of posts posted online for emergency help.
不少武汉市民自发加入到为患者免费送药的行动中。
Many Wuhan city residents have spontaneously joined in the free delivery of drugs for patients in the action.
吴悠和他的朋友们就在其中。
Wu Yu and his friends are among them.
26岁的吴悠是一名还在实习期的武汉中学物理老师。
Wu Yong, 26, is an intern in Wuhan high school physics teacher.
1月25日开始，吴悠与19岁的大一学生黄新元，一人骑电瓶车，一人骑自行车，穿梭在武汉的大街小巷，为分布在医院、隔离点和小区的求助者义务送药。
Wu and his 19-year-old freshman, Huang NZ, began traveling through Wuhan streets on January 25 on electric cars and bicycles by one person to deliver medicine to clients scattered in hospitals, isolation points and small districts.
截至2月13日，他们已经为500多户求助者送去需要的药品和防护物资。
As at 13 February, they had delivered needed medicines and protective materials to more than 500 households.
“能送一天药就多送一天，”吴悠说，“希望从我这里拿到药的病人能够再努力撑一撑，等到确诊、收治、康复。
"One more day's supply of medicine," Wu said. "I hope patients who get the medicine from me can work on it again until they are diagnosed, admitted and rehabilitated.
”━━━━━“一开始想给大家搭把手”吴悠萌生给需要的人送药的想法，最初是想“搭把手”帮个忙。
"--James Russell Wu Yu-sheng" At first thought of giving medicine to those who needed it, but at first he wanted to "lend a hand."
1月23日，武汉正式关闭离汉通道时，吴悠赶去药店买了口罩和一些常用的药品，送去爷爷奶奶家。
When Wuhan officially closed the Han corridor on January 23, Wu Yu rushed to the drugstore to buy masks and some commonly used medicines and took them to his grandparents' house.
爷爷家存了些口罩，就对他说，“把口罩送给需要的人吧，一个人有一万个口罩也只能救一个人，但分给一万个人就可以救一万个人”。
Grandfather put some masks in his house, and said to him, "Give a mask to someone who needs it. A man can save only one person with 10, 000 masks.
他很认同爷爷的说法。
He agreed with Grandpa.
因为自己此前囤了500个一次性医用外科口罩，就给所有在武汉的朋友都打电话问他们是否需要口罩。
Because he had previously hoarded 500 disposable medical surgical masks, he called all his friends in Wuhan to ask if they needed them.
一个身在外地的朋友请他帮忙，给家人送点生活物资和口罩，这在吴悠看来就是“带一脚”的事。
A friend in the field asked him to help, to send some household supplies and masks to his family, in Wu Yo's view, "with a foot."
回小区时看到老人们都没戴口罩，他就每人送了两包。
When he returned to the community, he saw that the old people were not wearing masks, he gave each of them two bags.
1月25日中午，吴悠和黄新元拿着剩下的三百多个口罩站在路口送给没戴口罩的老人。
At noon on January 25, Wu Yo and S $Huang stood at the intersection with the remaining 300 masks and gave them to the elderly without masks.
黄新元记得，有位80多岁的老奶奶用手捂着口鼻，询问他们附近是否有酒店，她说因为发烧怕传染给孩子，就自己出来找房子住。
Ms. Huang remembers an 80-year-old woman clutching her nose and mouth and asking if there was a hotel nearby. She said she had come out to find a house for fear of infecting her children with a fever.
黄新元把一包口罩送给她，指了方向，她眼角闪过泪花，颤颤巍巍地走了。
Huang gave her a bag of masks, pointed the way, her eyes flashed tears, trembling to leave.
“我就萌生了免费跑腿给人们送药、送口罩的想法。
"I started the idea of free errands to give people medicine and masks.
”吴悠说，他找来一张白纸，写上“免费帮送药、食、口罩”，挂在电瓶车前。
Wu said he found a blank sheet of paper and wrote "free medicine, food, masks" and hung it in front of the electric car.
他在微博和朋友圈都发了一条信息，“汉口这边我知道一个地方还有口罩、药，我可以去江岸区、江汉区、硚口区，家里有老人，自己人在外地我都可以帮你送，不收费”。
He posted a message on Weibo and in his circle of friends, "I know a place here in Hankou where there are masks and medicines. I can go to Jiangan district, Jianghan district and Zhangkou district.
吴悠手机里开始不断弹出新消息，在便利店吃完一份盒饭的功夫，已经有几百条评论和点赞。
Wu Yo's mobile phone keeps popping up new information and eating a boxed meal in a convenience store has attracted hundreds of comments and compliments.
其中五分之一的留言请他帮忙送药，还有一些留言说要给他捐赠物资。
One-fifth of the messages asked him to take his medicine, and others said he would give him supplies.
他和黄新元马上分工，他确认求助的信息，按照求助者留言的顺序，一个个把他们需要的药列出来。
He and the S $Huang division of labor immediately, he confirmed the information, according to the caller's message order, one by one they need the list of drugs.
由他垫钱，黄新元先去跑药店买药，两人再分头去送。
By him advance money, yellow dollar goes to the drugstore to buy medicine first, two people send separately again.
黄新元去了附近营业的药店，奥司他韦胶囊已经开始限购，一张身份证只能买一板，他跑了三家药店，买到三板。
Mr. Huang went to a nearby drugstore, where Ostaway capsules have begun to limit purchases. One card can only buy one board. He ran three pharmacies and bought three tablets.
吴悠把三板奥司他韦胶囊剪成一粒一粒，装在一次性纸杯里，先分给五个求助者，“先解燃眉之急，等我们买到药了，我再给人家重新送一次。
Wu Yue cut the triple board oseltamivir capsule into a grain, in a disposable paper cup, first distributed to the five sufferers, "to solve the urgent problem, when we buy medicine, I will give someone another time.
”送药路上，他收到求助者信息说，“您把药放在门口就行，我不知道我是什么原因发烧。
"On the way, he received a message from the caller," Just leave the medicine at the door, I don't know why I have a fever.
”“我当时也挺害怕，毕竟是给可能感染肺炎的病人送药，但都在路上了，先搞了再说。
"" I was scared too, after all, of giving medicine to people who might get pneumonia, but it was all on the way.
”吴悠回忆当时的情况说。
"Wu recalled the situation at the time.
他们从下午2点开始送药，一直送到晚上10点，也只送了5家。
They began to deliver medicine from 2 p.m. until 10 p.m., and only five were delivered.
吴悠反思说，“当时没有规划路线，按照留言顺序送，送完这家去下一家又是另一个方向，8个小时来回至少25公里，有4个小时都在给电瓶车充电。
'There was no planning route, 'says Mr. Wu.' Send the car from one direction to the next, eight hours to at least 25 kilometers back and forth, and four hours to recharge the battery.
”求助者和捐赠者的信息还在不停弹出来，到第二天上午，他已经收到超过1600条评论和私信，一万个点赞，求助信息超过五百条。
Callers and donors kept popping up, and by the next morning he had received more than 1,600 comments and personal letters, 10,000 compliments and more than 500 requests for help.
━━━━━“那一刻，我觉得自己是在‘救人’”从开始送药，吴悠的一天是从回复手机里999+的新消息开始的。
I felt at that moment that I was delivering medicine. Wu Yo's day started with the news of 999 + from my cell phone.
捐赠者的每条信息都需要回复，这关系到他们能不能给求助者免费提供口罩、酒精、消毒液和一部分药品。
Every message from the donor needs to be answered, which is about whether they can give free masks, alcohol, disinfectant and some medicines to the client.
1月27日起，捐赠物资陆续寄出或到货他会马上发布在微博上，让需要的求助者留言，他们再免费提供给求助的病人、老人和小孩。
From January 27, donations will be posted on microblogs as soon as they arrive, allowing needy clients to leave messages that they can provide free of charge to patients, the elderly and children who need help.
如果是很紧急的求助信息，收药人的地址离他家距离不超过10公里，他会马上回复，“好的，来了”。
If it's urgent, the recipient's address is no more than 10 kilometers from his home and he responds immediately, "OK, here we go."
更多的求助信息分散在武汉各个区，他只能统一回复，“抱歉电瓶车真送不了那么远，优先给病人、老人和婴儿送吧”。
More help information scattered throughout Wuhan, he can only unified response, "I'm sorry that the electric car really can not deliver so far, give priority to the sick, the elderly and babies.
向吴悠求助的人，有正在隔离的、疑似或确诊感染新型冠状肺炎的患者本人，也有陪护的患者家属，更多的是帮家里的老人求助。
Those who turn to Wu for help include those who are quarantined, suspected or diagnosed with new forms of coronary pneumonia, as well as the families of accompanying patients, who are more likely to help the elderly in their families.
求助者的药品和防护物资需求并不能每天满足。
The need for medicines and protective materials for sufferers cannot be met every day.
首先每天能在药店买到的药并不稳定，口罩、酒精之类物资很早就断货了，他们得每天去药店碰运气。
First of all, the medicines you can buy at the drugstore every day are not stable. Masks, alcohol, etc. are out of stock very early. They have to go to the pharmacy every day to try their luck.
黄新元家附近的十几家药店，他每个上午会全部跑一趟，有两家药店不限购连花清瘟胶囊和奥司他韦颗粒，他每种得买上几十盒。
He goes to a dozen pharmacies near the S $Huang home every morning. Two pharmacies offer no restriction on rinderpest capsules and oseltamivir granules. He has to buy dozens of boxes each.
1月27日晚上10点，吴悠接到一个来自黄石的求助电话，这位网友说他的姑父姑妈在武汉家中，都确诊感染新型冠状肺炎，两位老人已经出现呼吸困难、讲不出话的情况，家里一点药都没有了，两位老人在家隔离也没办法出去买。
At 10 p.m. on January 27, Wu received a call from Huang Shi, a netizen who said his aunts and aunts had been diagnosed with the new type of coronary pneumonia at their home in Wuhan.
吴悠一听也急了，他披上雨衣骑车冲进雨里。
Wu Yo listened to it, he put on his raincoat and rode into the rain.
找到具体位置时，已经快十二点了， “砰砰”连敲了几下门，听到有开门声赶紧离开，走到电梯口时，网友姑妈拿着药走过来，冲他深鞠了几个躬。
It was almost twelve o'clock when he found the exact location. He banged on the door several times, heard the sound of opening the door and hurried away.
出了小区，冷风一吹，吴悠一阵害怕，他把身上的雨衣脱了扔进路边的垃圾桶，又怕万一沾染了病毒，条件反射地把身上最后一点84消毒水全倒进了垃圾桶。
Out of the neighborhood, a cold wind blowing, Wu Yu a moment of fear, he threw his raincoat into the roadside dustbin, and fear in the event of contamination, conditioned his body into the last 84 disinfectant into the garbage can.
回来后，他对黄新元说，以后只给病人送药。
Upon his return, he told Mr. Huang that only medicines would be given to patients in future.
3天后，吴悠接到那位黄石网友的消息，说那天是很关键的一晚，在病人非常无助时给了他们几天的药，现在他们已经联系上社区，进入医院治疗，情况也在好转。
Three days later, Wu Yo received news from the Huang Shi netizen, saying that it had been a crucial night and that the patient had been given medicine for several days when he was very helpless.
吴悠感慨，“那一刻，我觉得自己是在‘救人’。
"At that moment, I felt that I was' saving people '.
”黄新元也有同样的感触。
The S $Huang feels the same way.
1月30日，一个在酒店隔离的疑似患者，请他帮忙买奥司他韦等四种治疗肺炎的药。
On January 30, a suspected patient was quarantined at the hotel and asked for help buying four drugs to treat pneumonia, including oseltamivir.
连着几天，黄新元都把药送过去。
Over the course of several days, the medicine was delivered by S $Huang.
2月9日，这位求助者在微信里告诉黄新元，他已经被转入附近的方舱医院接受治疗。
In a letter dated February 9, the suitor told Mr. Huang that he had been transferred to a nearby cabin hospital for treatment.
“他们有条件接受治疗前，被隔离在家或酒店，我们送的药可能就是一根救命稻草。
"They're isolated at home or in a hotel before they can afford it, and the medicine we're giving could be a lifesaver.
”黄新元说。
'she said.
━━━━━骑往目的地吴悠送药上门时，会尽量避免直接接触收药的人。
Dr. Simpson When you ride to your destination, avoid direct contact with the person receiving the medicine.
在发来的求助信息里，收药者基本都是疑似或确诊感染新型冠状肺炎的患者。
In the help message sent, the recipients are mostly suspected or confirmed patients with new coronary pneumonia.
在吴悠开始送药的前几天，主要送的是家附近的小区，都是直接送药上门。
Wu Yu began to deliver medicine a few days before the main home is sent to the neighborhood, are direct delivery of medicine door.
他和黄新元的防护装备只有一个N95口罩，他戴着头盔，玻璃罩拉下来，电瓶车充电时就在一旁用酒精擦裸露在外的脖子和双手。
With only one N95 mask for his protective gear, he wore a helmet and a glass cover, which he used to wipe his bare neck and hands with alcohol while recharging his battery.
送药时，他把药放在门口，拍个照片或视频，敲几下门得到一声回应后便离开，他一般在门口停留不超过10秒钟。
When he gave the medicine, he left it at the door, took a picture or video of it, knocked on the door several times for a response, and then left, usually staying at the door for no more than 10 seconds.
也有一些严格管理进出的小区，他只能等在小区门口或楼下等求助者来拿，但都不会直接和他们碰面。
There are also strict management of access to the community, he can only wait at the door or downstairs waiting for the callers to come, but will not directly meet them.
“他们自己也会特别注意，怕感染到我，距离很远就让我把药放在地上”。
"They themselves will pay special attention, for fear of infecting me, far away let me put the medicine on the ground."
▲吴悠出发前准备好的药品、口罩和酒精。
Wu Yu set out prepared before the drugs, masks and alcohol.
受访者供图给医院和在酒店隔离的求助者送药。
Interviewees were asked to provide medication to hospitals and clients isolated in hotels.
他会请保安或大厅的医护人员转交。
He'll ask the security guard or the paramedics in the lobby.
偶尔有在隔离点的患者并未给他具体房间号或真实姓名，他就把药品放在大厅的桌子上，站在两米远的位置等他们来拿。
Occasionally, the patient at the isolation point did not give him a specific room number or a real name, and he placed the medicine on the table in the lobby, standing two metres away until they could get it.
2月11日，是他义务送药的18天里送药距离最长的一天，在这一天，他骑电瓶车跑了80多公里，途中充电两次，给9位求助者送完药回到家，全程耗时已超过15个小时。
On February 11, the longest day of delivery in his 18 days of volunteer delivery, he ran more than 80 kilometres on a motorbike, recharged his batteries twice and delivered medicine to nine sufferers, a journey that took more than 15 hours.
起初吴悠送药的路线来回尽量在35公里以内，因为他的电瓶车在满电状态下可以骑行35公里，低气温下骑行更会加大耗电，可骑行的行程缩短到25公里。
At first, Wu Yo took the medicine back and forth within 35 kilometers, because his car was able to ride 35 kilometers at full capacity. Cycling at low temperatures would shorten the journey to 25 kilometers.
这次吴悠决定去离家30公里的青山区送药，是因为一位叫四月的求助者发来的第七次求助，她发来家人的确诊病例单，她自己也开始发烧，家里已经没有药， “实在不忍心拒绝，她太无助了。
Wu Yo decided to send medicine to Qingshan District, 30 kilometers from home, because a patient called April sent for help for the seventh time. She sent a confirmed list of cases from her family.
”吴悠说。
"said Wu.
2月11日上午11点出发前，吴悠照例装上一纸箱药品放在车篮里，重量超过10公斤，他和线上志愿者规划好这条送药路线，从江汉区到武昌区再到青山区，按顺序送药给9位求助者，估计往返需要骑行60公里。
Before leaving at 11 a.m. on Feb. 11, Wu Yo routinely packed a carton of medicine into his basket, weighing more than 10 kg. He and the volunteers on the line planned the delivery route from Jianghan district to Wuchang district to Qingshan District.
但实际需要骑行的行程却比估算的多出三分之一。
But the actual number of trips by bike is one-third higher than the estimate.
晚上7点，距离四月的家还有17公里时，吴悠的电瓶车第二次只剩下一格电，而青山区的三位求助者之间距离也有十几公里。
At 7 p.m., 17 kilometers from his home in April, Wu Yo's battery was down to a grid for the second time, and the distance between the three suitors in Qingshan was about a dozen kilometers.
吴悠搜了一下附近并没有充电桩，他在自己组建的送药求助群里求助，骑车到2公里远一位群友家，送电瓶上楼充电。
Wu searched the nearby uncharged pile, asked for help from his drug delivery group, cycled to a friend's house two kilometers away and sent a battery upstairs to recharge his batteries.
敲门后，对方端着一碗粥给他，他接过碗站远一点，三下五除二吃完，跑下楼坐在阶梯上等，“特殊时期大家相互之间接触都挺害怕的，但又在互帮互助”。
After knocking on the door, the other side brought him a bowl of porridge, he took the bowl stand a little farther, ran downstairs to sit on the ladder, and so on, "in special times people are afraid of each other, but help each other."
黄新元骑自行车送药对骑行距离的限制更大，他一般只能送10公里远的地方，八九个地点下来，也得六七个小时，“腿已经没有知觉了，感觉不到累了，饿了就在便利店随便买点吃的”。
He normally travels only 10 kilometers away, or six or seven hours down from eight or nine locations. "He doesn't feel his legs anymore, he doesn't feel tired, so when he's hungry he buys something at a convenience store.

受访者供图但对于不会开车的吴悠和黄新元而言，电动车和自行车是他们现在能找到的最佳交通工具。
But for those who can't drive, electric cars and bicycles are the best means of transport available to them.
这些困难他们都能克服，只要歇一会儿，他们又背着几个家庭的药品，穿过武汉空空荡荡的大街小巷，骑往下一个目的地。
These difficulties they can overcome, as long as a short break, they carry a few families of medicine, through Wuhan empty streets, riding to the next destination.
━━━━━尽自己力坚持下去不少网友在评论里感谢他帮忙送药，为他点赞，提醒他做好防护。
George Eliot Many netizens thanked him in their comments for helping him deliver medicine, praised him, and reminded him to take precautions.
吴悠的行为也引发了一些网友的质疑。
Wu Yu's behavior also caused some netizens to question.
有网友以为他在无偿给药，发来不合常规的求助信息，比如要100片口罩，几十盒奥司他韦。
Some netizens thought he was giving medicine free of charge and sent out irregular help messages, such as 100 masks and dozens of boxes of oseltamivir.
他在微博上贴出需要收费的药品价格和免费的物资后，也有人质疑他在“作秀 ”，是药房的人，在发“国难财”。
After posting on his microblog the price of drugs and free supplies, he was also questioned whether he was "showing off", a pharmacy man who was making "national fortune."
吴悠开始注意公示每一条药品的价格和捐赠物资的明细，帮求助者去药店购买免疫蛋白、维生素或其他可能需要的药品时，他把照片和发票一起发给求助者确认。
Wu began to pay attention to the price of each drug and the details of donations, helping people to buy immune proteins, vitamins or other drugs that might be needed at pharmacies. He sent photos and invoices to the callers for confirmation.
黄新元送药时，有求助者会在药品价格之上给他发个小红包，一开始他都不敢收，在和吴悠商量后，他们会告诉求助者，这个红包将作为捐款，为其他需要帮助的病人或老人购买药品和物资。
After consulting with Wu, they would tell the caller that the red envelope would be used as a donation to buy medicine and materials for other needy patients or elderly people.
送药途中，吴悠有时会用gopro记录下来，剪成vlog视频，上传到微博和朋友圈，记录送药时的心情。
On the way, Wu sometimes uses gopro to record, cut into vlog video, upload to Weibo and friends circle, record the mood when delivering medicine.
在一条朋友圈中他写道：“今天是普通的、严峻的一天，还有病人没有被收治，大家都要咬着牙走下去”。
"It was a normal, grim day," he wrote in a circle of friends. "There were patients who had not been admitted, and everyone had to grind their teeth."
吴悠爸爸看到他的朋友圈，才知道他在为患者免费送药，他在儿子的朋友圈里留言：“尽自己力坚持下去，但要保护好自己，不要超出自己承受范围”。
When Wu Yu saw his friends, he knew that he was giving medicine to the patient for free. He left a message in his son's circle of friends: "Do your best, but don't overdo it."
吴悠的朋友和一些网友也加入到免费送药志愿者的队伍。
Wu Yo's friends and some netizens also joined the team of free drug delivery volunteers.
他的团队有了7位线上志愿者和4位骑手。
His team has seven online volunteers and four riders.
线上志愿者按照行政区域划分，在网上整理求助资料，发给他求助者的需求和位置，他再和骑手商量怎么送。
Online volunteers, divided by administrative district, collate the help material online and send it to the caller's needs and location. He then discusses with the rider how to deliver it.
现在，他们的送药区域从武汉的江汉区、江岸区已覆盖到武汉市内所有区域。
Now, their drug delivery areas from Wuhan Jianghan District, Jiangan District has covered all the regions of Wuhan.
他建了一个群，把来不及回复的求助者们都拉进去，现在群里已经超过250人，他打算先尽力帮助这些求助者，再拉入其他需要帮助的人。
He set up a group of callers who had no time to answer, and now there were more than 250 in the group, and he was going to try his best to help these suitors and others in need.
群里的氛围变化很大。
The atmosphere in the group changed a lot.
一开始大家都在无助的情绪下，不停地发求助消息，志愿者们每天更新武汉能买到的药品信息。
At the beginning, everyone was in a helpless mood, constantly sending help messages, volunteers every day to update Wuhan can buy the drug information.
再往后，住进方舱医院或其他隔离点的患者开始分享治疗经验，也有心理咨询师加入进来，带着大家做做游戏，听听音乐，“帮大家放松心情，转移注意力，让大家在等药、等治疗的过程中没有那么无助”。
Later, the patients admitted to the cabin hospital or other isolation points began to share their treatment experiences. Psychologists joined them, taking everyone to play games and listening to music. "Help us relax, divert attention, and not be so helpless as we wait for medicine," he said.
一位确诊感染新型冠状肺炎的单亲妈妈也加入进来，她隔离在家的几天很缺药，吴悠给她送了几天药和生活物资。
A single mother who was diagnosed with a new type of coronary pneumonia also joined in. She was isolated at home for several days without medicine. Wu gave her medicine and supplies for several days.
她在病情好转后，第一时间告诉了吴悠，她想把朋友新寄给她的20个N95口罩捐出来，给其他需要的人。
As soon as she got better, she told Wu Yo that she wanted to donate the 20 N95 masks that her friends had recently sent her to other people in need.
2月12日凌晨三点，吴悠终于到家，站在家门口把脱下来的口罩和防护衣用垃圾袋装好，连喷好几下酒精，由于他所在的小区没有专门回收口罩的垃圾桶，他得这样初步消毒。
Wu finally got home at 3 a.m. on Feb. 12, standing in front of his home and putting off his mask and protective clothing in a garbage bag and spraying alcohol several times.
他在取暖器边上坐了半小时才缓过劲，拿出了在楼下24小时便利店买的三个面包和一听可乐。
He sat by the radiator for half an hour before he pulled out the three loaves of bread and a coke he'd bought in a 24-hour convenience store downstairs.
新加入的骑手志愿者发来微信，“才送完药到家，她拿到药都哭了”。
New rider volunteers sent a message, "just sent the medicine home, she got the medicine cry."
“那还是值得的，休息吧兄弟。
"It's worth it, brother.
