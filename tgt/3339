过去两周中国以外地区新冠肺炎感染者病例数量增加了13倍世卫组织（WHO）总干事谭德塞宣布，此次新冠疫情经评估可定性为“大流行”。
The number of new cases of pneumonia outside China has increased 13-fold in the past two weeks, the director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), Edith Tan, announced that the new outbreak was assessed as a "pandemic."
（图片来源：世卫官方推特）欧洲中部时间3月11日，世卫组织（WHO）总干事谭德塞宣布，此次新冠疫情经评估可定性为“大流行”。
(Source: WHO official Twitter) March 11, Europe Central Time, the Director-General of the World Health Organization announced that the new crown epidemic can be assessed as a "pandemic."
他说，过去两周中国以外地区新冠肺炎感染者病例数量增加了13倍，他对“令人担忧的不作为”深感忧虑。
He said he was deeply concerned about "worrying inaction" after a 13-fold increase in the number of new cases of pneumonia outside China in the past two weeks.
“宣布大流行证实了数周以来的数据所显示的情况：新冠病毒正在世界上许多国家传播。
"The announcement confirms what the data for weeks have shown: the new crown virus is spreading in many countries around the world.
这并不意味着今天的情况比昨天更严重，而只是一个警告：每个国家都需要做好预防新冠的准备。
This does not mean that the situation is worse today than it was yesterday, but rather a warning that every country needs to be prepared to prevent a new crown.
”美国疾控中心前主任费和平说。
"said Fei Heping, former director of the Centers for Disease Control.
上一次世卫组织宣布大流行是2009年被称为“猪流感”的新型流感病毒H1N1，在这一决定做出之前，H1N1流感已在多个国家蔓延了大约六个星期。
The latest WHO decision to declare a pandemic as the new influenza A (H1N1) virus known as swine flu in 2009 came after H1N1 had spread in several countries for about six weeks.
如今它已成为季节性的常规流感。
It is now a seasonal, routine flu.
此次新冠疫情开始在国际上传播之后，世卫组织突发事件委员会曾于1月30日将其定性为“国际关注的突发公共卫生事件”。
After the outbreak began to spread internationally, the WHO Emergency Committee on January 30 characterized it as a "public health emergency of international concern."
WHO在3月11日的发布会上指出，在全球114个国家/地区共有11.8万新冠肺炎病例，超过90％的病例集中在4个国家/地区，其中2个国家（中国和韩国）的发病率显著下降。
More than 90 percent of the 118,000 new cases of pneumonia in 114 countries / areas worldwide are concentrated in four countries / areas, with two countries (China and South Korea) reporting significant declines, the World Health Organization (WHO) said.
81个国家未报告任何病例，57个国家报告10例或更少的感染者。
Eighty-one countries did not report any cases, and 57 reported 10 or fewer cases.
截至北京时间3月11日17时，中国以外共113个国家和地区累计确诊新冠肺炎37371例，死亡共计1130例。
As of March 11, 2007 at 1700 hours Beijing time, a total of 37,371 new cases of pneumonia and 1,130 deaths had been confirmed in 113 countries and regions outside China.
与前一日数据相比，中国以外新增确诊病例4596例，新增死亡病例258例。
Compared with the previous day, 4,596 new cases and 258 new deaths were confirmed outside China.
新增4个国家和地区——玻利维亚、牙买加、布基纳法索、刚果民主共和国。
Four new countries and territories - Bolivia, Jamaica, Burkina Faso, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
谭德塞说，“这是冠状病毒感染第一次被称为大流行，但与此同时，我们也相信这将会是第一个可以遏制的暴发。
"This is the first time that a coronavirus infection has been called a pandemic, but at the same time we believe it will be the first outbreak to be contained," said Tan.
”谭德塞说，一些国家已经证明该病毒可以被抑制和控制。
Some countries have shown that the virus can be suppressed and controlled, Tan said.
他呼吁各国政府采取“紧急和积极的行动”来改变疫情的进展。
He called on governments to take "urgent and positive action" to change the course of the epidemic.
实际上，过往的冠状病毒感染——SARS及MERS（中东呼吸综合征）均未被定义为全球大流行。
In fact, no previous coronavirus infection - SARS and MERS - has been defined as a global pandemic.
美国加州大学洛杉矶分校公共卫生学院副院长、流行病学资深终身教授张作风向《中国新闻周刊》表示，世卫组织“大流行”的宣布太迟，因为新冠肺炎已经在全球六大洲出现病例，并且具备人传人和死亡率高的特征。
Zhang style, vice-dean and senior professor of epidemiology at the UCLA School of Public Health, told China News Weekly that the WHO "pandemic" had come too late, as the disease had spread across six continents and was characterized by high human-to-human transmission and mortality.
“宣布大流行以后，各国政府都要把疫情防控作为头等大事来抓，而且WHO有责任协同所有国家，动员各国政府首脑和相关机构来控制疫情。
"After a pandemic is declared, governments need to make prevention and control a top priority, and WHO has a responsibility to work with all countries to mobilize heads of government and relevant agencies to control the epidemic.
”香港大学公共卫生学院教授高本恩告诉《中国新闻周刊》，现在还不是太晚，但它可以更早宣布。
Professor Gao Benn, of the University of Hong Kong's School of Public Health, told China Newsweek it was not too late, but it could have announced it earlier.
因为早至2月初，情况就变得很清楚了：要控制住新冠疫情并阻止它成为一场全球大流行是极其困难的。
As early as early as early February, it became clear that it would be extremely difficult to contain the outbreak and prevent it from becoming a global pandemic.
哈佛大学公共卫生学院流行病统计学教授，传染病动态研究中心主任Marc Lipsitch3月3日利用计算模型预测，全球将会有20%至60%的成人感染新冠病毒。
Marc Lipsitch, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health and Director of the Center for Research into the Dynamics of Infectious Diseases, predicted on March 3 that 20% to 60% of adults worldwide would be infected with the new crown virus.
不过，他解释，这个令人担忧的预测只有在缺乏强有力应对措施的情况下才会出现。
He explained, however, that this worrying forecast would emerge only in the absence of a strong response.
如果各国继续采取比如取消公共集会、关闭学校等干预措施，疫情在达到这一感染规模之前可能会减缓或停止。
If countries continue with interventions such as the cancellation of public gatherings and the closure of schools, the epidemic may slow or stop before it reaches the scale of the infection.
中国疫情已进入稳定期，3月11日，全国新增确诊病例数15例，累计报告确诊病例80793例。
The epidemic in China has entered a period of stabilization, with 15 new confirmed cases and 80,793 confirmed cases reported nationwide on March 11.
张作风告诉《中国新闻周刊》，意大利的情况比较严重，病例数增加很快，医疗资源也有挤兑的风险，现在医院走廊里都是病人。
Zhang told China News Weekly that the situation in Italy is serious, the number of cases is growing rapidly, and there is a risk of a run on medical resources, and the hospital corridors are now full of patients.
更糟糕的是，疫情开始从意大利北方向南方蔓延，而南方的经济能力和医疗系统都比北方要弱很多。
Worse, the epidemic is beginning to spread from northern Italy to the south, where economic capacity and health systems are much weaker than in the north.
WHO宣布数小时后，意大利宣布了欧洲迄今最严厉的封锁措施。
Hours after the WHO's announcement, Italy announced Europe's toughest embargo yet.
张作风指出，伊朗的问题在于，对于实际情况摸不清楚底，反对党站出来说实际感染人数和死亡人数要比官方发布的高得多，再加上伊朗受到国际制裁有一段时间，经济和医疗系统力量都比较薄弱，未来可能是比较严重的一个重灾区。
Zhang pointed out that Iran's problem is that it is not clear what the actual situation is, that the opposition stands up and says that the actual number of infections and deaths is much higher than the official figures, and that Iran has been under international sanctions for some time, with weak economic and health systems and a potentially serious future disaster area.
相比之下，韩国的防控决心比较大，每天检测1万人，以尽早发现、隔离感染者和密切接触者，现在感染人数在下降。
South Korea, by contrast, is more determined to control the disease, with 10,000 people being tested every day to detect, isolate, and engage people at an early stage, and the number of infections is now declining.
美国疫情防控中最受质疑的环节在检测。
The most controversial aspect of the U. S. epidemic is being tested.
截至最新数据，美国感染人数为1311人，病例数量在全球排名第8位。
The latest figures put the number of cases in the United States at 1,311, the eighth highest in the world.
但是哈佛大学公共卫生学院流行病统计学教授Marc Lipsitch说，现在每天报告的新增病例并不“新”，只是随着测试人数增加从而新发现的而已。
But Marc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health, said the new cases being reported each day were not "new" but were discovered as the number of people tested increased.
他认为，美国的检测能力还远不够，而实际感染数量要远高于此。
In his view, the U. S. detection capacity is far from enough, and the actual number of infections is much higher.
在美国众议院11日举行的听证会上，CDC主任罗伯特⋅雷德菲尔德表示，目前确实有原本被诊断为流感但实际上死于新冠病毒的病例。
At a hearing on the 11-day session of the US House of Representatives, CDC director Robert Redfield said that there had indeed been cases of people who had been diagnosed with influenza but had actually died from the new crown virus.
北京时间3月12日，美国著名好莱坞影星汤姆·汉克斯与妻子在澳大利亚被检测出新冠病毒阳性，NBA也因疫情困扰，也宣布本赛季余下所有比赛暂停。
Famous Hollywood star Tom Hanks and his wife were tested positive for the new crown virus in Australia on Monday, and the NBA suspended all games for the rest of the season.
当地时间3月11日傍晚，美国总统特朗普宣布，为疫情防控，从3月13日（星期五）午夜开始，未来30天内禁止欧洲游客前往美国的旅行（英国除外）。
On the evening of March 11, US President Trump announced a ban on European travel to the United States (except the United Kingdom) for the next 30 days, starting at midnight on Friday, March 13.
随后发布的一份总统公告明确，来自申根区26个国家的游客被禁止入境。
A presidential proclamation issued subsequently made it clear that visitors from 26 countries in the Schengen area were prohibited from entering the country.
张作风指出，边境限制是一种重要手段，但当社区传播出现时，就需要一整套降低社区感染风险的措施。
Zhang noted that border restrictions are an important tool, but when community transmission occurs, a comprehensive set of measures is needed to reduce the risk of infection in the community.
