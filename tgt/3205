澎湃新闻记者 赵实3月8日的下午，国务院新闻办在武汉举行的第三场记者见面会，迎来了6位特别的嘉宾——她们是医生、护士、记者、环卫工人，是父母的女儿、子女的妈妈、丈夫的妻子，也是奋战在武汉抗疫一线的巾帼战士。

在三八妇女节这个特殊的日子里，武汉市肺科医院重症医学科护士长钟小锋，河北省援鄂抗疫第一、第二批医疗队队长袁雅冬，湖北省妇联党组书记、主席李述永，武汉经济开发区环卫工人张春香，新华社湖北分社记者廖君，志愿者杨雪，共同受邀走上了国务院新闻办的发布台，分享她们的故事。

她的朴实日前，有这样一条短视频走红网络。
Her homespun days ago, there is such a short video popular network.
视频中，酒店经理讲述了一个动人的经历——一群在此隔离的环卫工人，在离店前将房间收拾的干干净净，前来查房的酒店工作人员感动落泪，她在视频中说，环卫工人做着城市最脏、最累的活，却有着最善良、最朴实的心灵。
In the video, the hotel manager tells the moving story of a group of segregated sanitation workers who clean up their rooms before they leave, and the hotel staff who come to check in tears, say in the video that the sanitation workers do the dirtiest and most tiring jobs in the city, but have the best and simplest hearts.
这群环卫工人之中的一员，也来到了3月8日的这场见面会。
One of the sanitation workers came to the meeting on March 8.
“我叫张春香，我是武汉经开区一名普通的环卫工人，今年1月28日接到公司通知，需要一批人在协和医院西区做保洁，当时我想，遇到这个事情，总得要人去做。
"My name is Zhang Chunxiang, an ordinary sanitation worker in Wuhan Jingkai District. I was informed by the company on January 28 that a group of people needed cleaning in the Western District of Concorde Hospital.
”张春香是最先进入重症隔离病房做保洁的16名突击队员之一。
Zhang Chunxiang was one of the first 16 commandos to enter the intensive care unit to clean.
她之前的工作是清扫马路。
Her previous job was sweeping the streets.
武汉封城后，她开始负责定点医院住院部、方舱医院等日常保洁、垃圾收集、清运。
Wuhan after the closure of the city, she began to be in charge of the designated hospital inpatient, square cabin hospital and other daily cleaning, garbage collection, transport.
身穿橘红色工作服的张春香，坐在发布台上时难掩紧张，她用武汉口音的普通话说道：“我做环卫工作十几年，有经验，我家的孩子都成人了，没有什么负担，我要站出来，我第一时间报名。
Zhang Chunxiang, dressed in orange overalls, was nervous as she sat down on the platform. "I've been sanitation for more than a decade, I have experience, my children are grown up and there is no burden," she said in Wuhan dialect.
”她回忆，刚开始报名的时候，老伴不同意，担心她年纪大，抵抗力差，容易感染，“我说医院的防护都很好，我们工作中和医生一样穿防护服，只要我们平时注意卫生，做好防护没有问题。
She recalls that when she first signed up, she disagreed, worried about her old age, poor resistance and susceptibility to infection. "I said the hospital was very well protected and we wore protective clothing at work like the doctors do, so long as we pay attention to hygiene and take precautions.
”谈到那条酒店的视频，张春香有些腼腆地笑了，“有很多网友为我们点赞。
"Turning to the video of the hotel, Zhang Chunxiang smiled shyly." There were a lot of netizens praising us.
”她说，“在这个时期，我们就是不想给别人添麻烦，我只想说希望大家多为别人去想一点，多为别人去做一点。
'At this point, we just don't want to be a nuisance to others, 'she says.
坚持一下，我们的武汉肯定会好起来的！”她的执着1 月 24日，河北医大第二医院呼吸与危重症科专家袁雅冬，毅然离别年迈多病的父母，主动请战，出征武汉。
On January 24, Yuan Yadong, an expert in Respiratory and Critical Medicine Division of Hebei Medical University No.2 Hospital, took the initiative to leave his ailing parents and asked them to go out to Wuhan.
至今，身为河北支援湖北首批医疗队队长的她，始终坚守在武汉抗疫一线。
So far, as the Hebei support Hubei first medical team leader, she has always adhered to the first line of the epidemic in Wuhan.
她还记得奔赴武汉的那个深夜，医疗队的150名医护人员乘坐绿皮火车，抵达武昌火车站时，已经是凌晨4点半。
She remembers the night of her trip to Wuhan, when 150 medical staff arrived at Wuchang railway station on a green train at 4: 30 am.
她们走下火车后，就迅速与武汉市第七医院对接，争分夺秒开展工作。
As soon as they got off the train, they docked with Wuhan Seventh Hospital and began their work in a hurry.
“我们负责这家医院4个病区的医疗护理工作，同时承担工作强度比较大、感染风险比较高的重症监护室和检验科的主要工作。
"We are responsible for medical care in the four wards of this hospital, and we are also responsible for the major work of intensive care units and examination departments, which have high intensity of work and high risk of infection.
当时，日均管理患者190人左右，并且一半以上都是重症和危重症患者。
At that time, an average of 190 patients per day were under management, and more than half were critically ill and critically ill.
”经过43天的不懈努力，目前已有250多位患者治愈好转出院。
After 43 days of unremitting efforts, more than 250 patients have been cured and discharged.
“在这场没有硝烟的站场中，为了提高治愈率，降低病死率，降低病人从重症向危重症发展，广大的医务人员与时间赛跑，和病毒斗争，有的甚至都牺牲了，用自己的生命挽救患者的生命，用自己的生命为全国人民筑起一道安全的屏障。
"In this smoke-free station, in order to improve the cure rate, reduce the fatality rate, reduce patients from serious to critical development, the vast majority of medical personnel with time race, and even the virus, some have even sacrificed their lives to save the lives of patients, their lives to build a security barrier for the entire people.
”想到牺牲的同行，袁雅冬禁不住落下眼泪。
Yuan Yadong couldn't help crying as he thought of his sacrifice.
但她很快拭去泪水，“我此时非常想说一句话：一起战，一起赢，战胜新冠，早日凯旋。
But she quickly wiped away her tears. "I really want to say this moment: together, together win, conquer the new crown, early triumphant.
”她的勇敢这是新华社记者廖君第一次作为被采访对象，在见面会上回答媒体同行的提问。
Her bravery was the first time Liao Jun, a Xinhua reporter, was interviewed and answered questions from her media colleagues at the meeting.
从去年 12 月 30 日发出第一条关于新冠肺炎疫情的内部稿件开始，廖君已经在抗疫报道一线战斗了2个多月，采访足迹踏遍火神山医院、方舱医院、定点收治医院、社区、隔离点等多地，也曾几次在毫无防备的情况下，近距离采访感染者。
Starting with the first internal article on the outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia on December 30 last year, Liao Jun has been fighting for more than two months in front of reports of the epidemic, covering places such as Mount Huoshen Hospital, Fangcao Hospital, designated hospitals, communities, isolation points, etc., and has conducted several close interviews with infected people without warning.
“其实说不怕是假的。
"It's not true, actually.
”廖君坦言，初期，在不知道疫情是如此严重的情况下，她没有做任何防护措施，就去采访了几位相关人士，事后，有几名采访对象被确认为感染者，“我现在想起来还有一点害怕。
Initially, unaware of the severity of the outbreak, she interviewed several people concerned, and several were later identified as infected. "I am a little scared now," he said.
”不仅如此，生活在武汉的她，身边也有熟悉的人传来确诊的消息，“这真的让我产生了随时都有可能牺牲的思想准备。
Not only that, but also living in Wuhan, there are people close to her confirmed message, "this really gives me the idea that sacrifice is possible at any time.
”但廖君没有退缩，她说自己在武汉上大学、工作、安家，熟悉这座城市的一街一巷，了解武汉人的喜、怒、哀、乐，这也提醒着她，要向世界讲述武汉这座英雄城市经历的一切。
But Liao Jun did not shrink back. She said she had gone to university in Wuhan, where she worked and settled down, knew the city's streets and lanes and learned about the delights, anger, mourning and joy of Wuhan people.
而这两个月的经历，给廖君带来的感动与震撼，也远远超过了对病毒的恐惧。
The experience of these two months, to Liao Jun brought moving and shock, also far exceeded the fear of the virus.
“那么多武汉市民默默付出，来自四面八方的医护人员驰援武汉，坚守在武汉各条战线上的普通工作者，是他们的隐忍顾全大局，还有他们的坚守支撑着这座城市。
"So many Wuhan people silently pay, from all sides of the medical staff rushed to Wuhan, adhere to Wuhan on all fronts of the ordinary workers, is their patience with the overall situation, and their adherence to support the city.
”廖君说，战斗不分男女，“只有我们进，疫情才能退。
Liao said the battle was not between men and women. "Only if we get in can the epidemic recede.
到现场去，到最危险的地方去，听老百姓最真实的声音，这是我们作为党的新闻工作者的职责和使命。
To go to the scene, to the most dangerous places, to listen to the real voice of the people, is our duty and mission as a Party journalist.
