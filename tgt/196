作者 |张庆宁    出品|棱镜·腾讯小满工作室大年初二（1月26日）这天，田书增一个小时之内，给人道了20多次歉。
AT & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45
每隔五到十分钟，这位河南省健琪医疗器械有限公司（下称“健琪医疗”）董事长就会接到一个电话，电话那头在求助口罩等医疗防护器材。
Every five to ten minutes, the chairman of Henan's Jianqi Medical Device Co., Ltd. receives a phone call about medical protection equipment such as a help mask.
健琪医疗是一家致力于麻醉、介入、急救、呼吸、护理等耗材的研发生产企业，此前口罩不是拳头产品，但现在是了。
Jianqi Medical is a research and development enterprise dedicated to anesthesia, intervention, first aid, breathing, nursing and other consumables.
该公司一天可以生产1.5万个口罩，装满7个纸箱。
The company can produce 15,000 masks a day and fill seven cartons.
“那些医院的院长，过去一般是找采购经理要货，现在都是直接找我，每个人都想要一两箱。
"The deans of those hospitals, who used to get things from the purchasing managers, now go straight to me and everyone wants a crate or two.
我供应不上，只能反复解释说，等原材料到了，马上给你解决。
I can not supply, can only explain repeatedly, when the raw materials arrived, I will give you a solution.
”他一边解释，一边说“对不起”。
"I'm sorry," he explained.
健琪医疗位于河南省长垣市，该市位居中国三大卫材基地之首，拥有各类卫材企业70多家，经营企业2000多家，平时占据全国市场销量50%以上。
Jianqi Medical Center is located in Changyuan City, Henan Province. The city is the top of China's Three-David Material Base, with more than 70 sanitary ware enterprises and more than 2,000 enterprises, accounting for more than 50% of the national market in peacetime.
长垣市场监督管理局数据显示，该市卫材总产能为医用外科口罩105万个/天，医用防护口罩3.5万个/天，一次性使用医用口罩56.2万个/天，医用一次性防护服2000套/天。
The city has a total capacity of 1.05 million surgical masks, 35,000 medical masks per day, 562,000 medical masks per day for one-time use and 2,000 sets / day for medical disposable protective clothing, according to the Changyuan Market Supervisory Authority.
但开工情况并不乐观。
But the start-up has not been encouraging.
长垣市医疗器械同业公会共计45家会员单位，其中一些大型企业紧急复产，但难以满足暴增的市场需求。
There are 45 member organizations in Changyuan Medical Device Trade Association, some of which can not meet the surging market demand.
“主要因为原材料供应不上。
"Mainly because raw materials are not available.
”田书增猛抽一口烟，提了提神。
"Tanaka took a swig at his cigarette, lifting his spirits.
Play原材料全用完了距离健琪医疗四五公里外，河南省戈尔医疗器械有限公司（下称“戈尔医疗”）董事长刘学凯在发愁复产的问题。
45 kilometers away from Jianqi Medical Center, Liu Xuekai, chairman of Henan Gore Medical Device Co., Ltd. is worried about resuming production.
戈尔医疗拥有医用外科口罩生产线两条，医用普通口罩生产线6条，满负荷运转的话，需要100多位员工。
Gore Medical has a medical surgical mask production line of two, medical mask production line of 6, full operating, need more than 100 staff.
腊月二十四，也就是1月18日这天，刘学凯找来班车，把20多号正在过年的工人从村里拉回工厂，“管吃管住，每天三倍工资。
On the 24th of January, Liu Xuekai found a shuttle bus to bring back workers from the village who were more than 20 during the Lunar New Year.
”口罩生产流程并不复杂，但需要工人把生产线制成的口罩装入塑料包装袋，再集体装入纸箱子。
The mask-making process is not complicated, but requires workers to pack face masks from the production line into plastic bags and then collectively into paper boxes.
平日里，熟练工的日工资是80元，春节期间涨到每天240元。
On weekdays, the daily salary of skilled workers is 80 yuan, the Spring Festival period rose to 240 yuan a day.
愿意从晚上9点到凌晨1点的，加班费200块，会计现场结账。
Would like to work from 9: 00 pm to 1: 00 am, overtime payment of 200 yuan, accounting field settlement.
“有的工人连续干了24个小时，脸发红，头发蒙，有些站不住了，我害怕他一头栽在那儿。
Some of the workmen had been working for twenty-four hours in a row, their faces were red, their hair masked, and some of them could not stand.
”刘学凯说。
"said Liu.
正在口罩生产车间加班的工人们1月18日到除夕当晚，戈尔医疗一共拿出40万支医用外科口罩，18万支医用普通口罩，其中1/3无偿捐给湖北等疫情重地，剩余2/3平价供应给等各地客户。
From January 18 to New Year's Eve, Gore produced 400,000 medical surgical masks and 180,000 medical masks, one-third of which were donated free of charge to patients in places such as Hubei and the remaining 2 / 3 parities to customers around the world.
“现在连半负荷都做不到。
"I can't even do half a load now.
用工紧张不是主要问题，主要是到除夕晚上，我们的原材料全用完了，连塑料包装袋都没了。
Job strain is not the main problem, mainly by New Year's Eve, we ran out of raw materials, even plastic bags.
”刘学凯只能大年初一停工一天。
Liu Xuekai can only close one day on New Year's Day.
腊月二十六上午9点，健琪医疗口罩车间的100多名员工全部到岗。
On Saturday morning at 9: 00 a.m., the Jianqi Medical Mask Workshop of more than 100 employees to the post.
田树增说，健琪医疗主要依靠原来储备的原材料，一直没有停工，“但再有两三天也将面临原材料匮乏的问题。
Tian said Jianqi Medical mainly rely on the original reserves of raw materials, has not stopped work, "but in two or three days will also face a shortage of raw materials.
”涨就涨吧，有货就行原材料供给成了大问题。
"Rising on the bar, goods on line on the supply of raw materials has become a major problem.
虽是如此，长垣市当地一位官员感概万千，这些大型企业都尽力了。
Even so, a local official in Changyuan was impressed, and the big companies did their best.
亚都医疗除夕夜装箱医用外科口罩20万个、一次性使用医用口罩200万个、医用帽50万个、医用手套20万只，共计290万个疫区急需医用防护类物资，当晚11点发往武汉。
About 200,000 medical surgical masks, 2 million disposable medical masks, 500,000 medical caps and 200,000 medical gloves were packed on New Year's Eve, and 2.9 million medical protective materials were urgently needed in 2.9 million affected areas, which were dispatched to Wuhan at 11 p.m.
飘安集团每天正在生产12万个口罩、700套防护服。
Piao An Group is producing 120,000 masks and 700 suits a day.
华西卫材每天正在生产10万个口罩、1200套防护服。
Huaxi Satellite produces 100,000 face masks and 1,200 suits of protective clothing every day.
还有一些中小企业也想复工，苦于缺少原材料，无法如愿。
Some small and medium-sized enterprises also want to return to work, suffering from a lack of raw materials.
以口罩为例，主要原材料包括外侧无纺布、过滤用的熔喷布、塑料包装袋、包装纸箱等，其中无纺布和熔喷布尤为稀缺。
In the case of masks, the main raw materials include the outer non-woven cloth, filter-used melting cloth, plastic bags, packaging cartons, and so on, of which non-woven and melt-jet fabrics are particularly scarce.
“我们工厂自建了无纺布生产线，自给自足没问题。
"Our factory built its own non-woven production line, self-sufficiency is no problem.
但国内品质比较好的熔喷布是天津泰达的，过滤率可以达到国际标准，”除夕之前，田书增就把款项打到泰达账户，大年初二，他手下一位采购副经理、一个司机把一辆货车停在泰达工厂门口，坐等拉货。
Before New Year's Eve, Tian Shuzheng began typing money into a Teda account. On the second day of the Lunar New Year, one of his deputy purchasing managers and a driver stopped a truck at the gate of the Teda factory waiting for the goods to be hauled.
原来熔喷布的市场价格1.8万元/吨，现在价格是2.9万元/吨。
The original market price of the melt-jet fabric is 18,000 yuan per ton, now the price is 29,000 yuan per ton.
“涨价就涨吧，有货就行。
"Price increases will go up. Goods will do.
”田书增说。
'he said.
戈尔医疗停工一天之后，大年初二，刘学凯把十多位公司中层叫回办公室，随后通知工人到岗，还把食堂的大师傅也请了回来。
A day after the Gore Medical Disruption, Liu Xuekai called back more than a dozen middle-level companies to his office, then informed the workers to their posts, and invited back the master of the canteen.
戈尔医疗已经准备好少量熔喷布，但缺少无纺布。
Gore Medical has prepared a small quantity of fusible fabric, but it lacks non-woven fabric.
当天下午，该公司采购部经理、司机驾驶一辆货车去了山东省临沂市的一家工厂，公文包内塞着30万元提货用的现金。
That afternoon, the company's purchasing manager and driver drove a lorry to a factory in Linyi, Shandong Province, where the briefcase was packed with 300,000 yuan in cash to pick up the goods.
“对方不保证装满车，只说有多少给我们装多少。
"The other side doesn't promise to fill the car, only how much to load.
我给对方说：‘你要是不给我装满车，我以后再也不会进你的货。
I said to each other, 'If you don't fill my car, I'll never come into your goods again.
’”刘学凯对原材料涨价同样头疼，“原来无纺布市场价1万元/吨，现在涨到一万三了。
"Liu Xuekai on the price of raw materials is also a headache," the original non-woven market price of 10,000 yuan / ton, now up to 13 million.
”他的另一个“哀求”对象是长垣本地一家原材料生产商，“你给我弄个三五吨，别叫我落跑（落空），咱们都是哥们，你不管我，你想咋着咧？”戈尔医疗的中层会议在初二下午结束，决定当晚复工。
His other plea was to a local raw material manufacturer, "Get me three or five tons, don't make me lose, we're all friends, you don't care about me, what do you want?" Gore Medical's mid-level meeting ended in the afternoon of Tuesday and decided to resume work that evening.
使死了也得干市场需求是旺盛的。
It is exuberant to dry up the market if you die.
1月26日上午11点，仅这一个小时，田书增接到10多个电话，来电者分别是医院院长、卫生局局长、疾控中心主任、各地政府领导等，“开口就是能来两箱口罩吗？”“有些十多年的老客户，他们不分时间，凌晨一点、两点、三点、四点，给我打电话。
At 11 a.m. on January 26, just one hour later, Mr. Tian received more than 10 calls from the hospital director, the director of the CDC, the director of the CDC and local government leaders.
我得罪不起，现在矛盾着呢，提到口罩就想哭。
I can't afford to offend. Now I'm ambivalent. I want to cry when I mention a mask.
”田书增每天顶多睡四个小时，眼睛通红。
Mr Tian slept four hours a day at most, his eyes flushed.
刘学凯也不知道怎么安抚客户，以及自己的业务员。
Liu Xuekai also does not know how to pacify the customer, as well as his own sales staff.
除夕当晚，戈尔医疗只剩最后一批口罩，几个业务员当着刘学凯的面差点打起来，最后他们达成协议，每个业务员只能分两箱，分头寄给自己的客户。
On New Year's Eve, Gore had only the last batch of masks left, and several salesmen nearly fought in front of Liu Xuekai. Finally, they agreed that each salesman should be sent to his customers in two cases.
长垣市医疗器械同业公会会长李明忠看着心焦。
Changyuan City Medical Device Trade Association President Li Mingzhong looked worried.
他最近接待了不少媒体，每见到一家，就会强调两个诉求，“第一是呼吁卫材产业链上的原材料企业早日开工，第二是希望原材料价格相对稳定，可以涨价，毕竟人工、物流都在涨，但别涨到我们生产商承受不住。
He recently received a lot of media, every time I see one, I would like to emphasize two appeal, the first is to call for the raw material enterprises on the chain of defense materials, the second is to hope that the price of raw materials can be relatively stable, can be increased, after all, labor, logistics are rising, but not to our producers can not bear.
”物流是另一个大问题，因为其他物流公司都停工了。
Logistics is another big problem because other logistics companies have stopped working.
健琪医疗最近仰仗的发货渠道主要是顺丰。
Jianqi Medical recently relied on the delivery channel is mainly Shunfeng.
田书增拿出一叠发货单，1月10日这天，健琪医疗发往黑龙江省牡丹江市三件止痛泵，重量31公斤，运费132元，走的是顺丰重货渠道。
On January 10, Jianqi Medical Center sent three pain relief pumps to Mudanjiang City, Heilongjiang Province, weighing 31 kg and transporting 132 yuan, using Shunfeng Heavy Goods Channel.
1月21日到现在，他们只能走顺丰标快渠道，每箱口罩重量在20公斤上下，运费却升至200多元到300多元不等。
January 21 to the present, they can only follow the Fengbiao express channel, each case weight around 20 kg, the freight rate rose to more than 200 to more than 300.
顺丰客户对此回复：顺丰重货计费标准是20公斤以内92元，超过这个标准之外每公斤收费3.4元；顺丰标快首重为23元/公斤，续重为13元/公斤。
Shunfeng customer response: Shun Fung heavy cargo charge standard is within 20 kg, exceeding the standard fee of 3.4 yuan per kg; Shun Fung quick first weight is 23 yuan / kg, the renewal weight is 13 yuan / kg.
“1月10日左右，顺丰逐步取消了重货服务，具体时间以当地营业网点为准。
"On or about January 10, Shunfeng phased out the heavy goods service, the specific time to local business outlets.
”“大多数生产口罩和防护服的企业不仅不向经销商涨价，而且要求经销商不准向医院涨价。
"Most companies that manufacture masks and protective clothing not only don't increase prices for dealers, they also require dealers not to raise prices to hospitals.
”李明忠说，医用普通口罩出厂价是每个9分左右，不到一毛钱，医用外科口罩每个在4毛钱到4毛5分之间。
The factory price for medical masks is about 9 cents each, less than 10 cents, and medical surgical masks range from 40 cents to 45 cents each, Li said.
“一个纸箱大概能装2000个，共计800块钱，我们发给客户还是一分钱没涨，但运费就要吃掉两三百块。
"" One carton can hold 2,000 or so pieces, making a total of 800 dollars. We still don't pay our customers any more, but the freight costs are two or three hundred dollars.
”田书增说，初一之后，加上工人三倍工资、原材料涨价、物流成本等原因，健琪医疗每天净亏损三万到五万元。
After the first day of junior high school, coupled with triple wages for workers, rising raw materials prices and logistics costs, Jianqi Medical suffered a net loss of 30,000 to 50,000 yuan a day, Tian added.
田书增算完这笔账后，又点了根烟，“我现在都快使（累）死了，但使死了也得干。
After adding this to his account, he lit another cigarette. "I'm dying now, but I have to do it anyway."
