早在 2 月 4 日，吉利德的 2843 箱瑞德西韦药物就已经运抵北京，时至今日人们却听到了入组患者太少的消息，“人民的希望”被浇了一头冷水。
As early as February 4, 2,843 cases of Rhetoric drugs arrived in Beijing in Jilid, but today people hear too little about the group and "people's hope" has been dampened.
瑞德西韦是被世界卫生组织认为是目前唯一可能抗击新冠病毒的药物。
Rhetsevir is considered by the World Health Organization to be the only drug available to fight the new crown virus.
“人民的希望”是网友对瑞德西韦英文名 Remdesivir 的谐音，也表达了民众对此药的期待。
"Hope of the people" is a netizen to Radesivir English name Remdesivir homonym, also expressed people's expectation of this medicine.
2 月 24 日的新闻发布会上，世界卫生组织总干事高级顾问布鲁斯 · 艾尔沃德（Bruce Aylward）透露，瑞德西韦临床试验牵头人、中日友好医院曹彬说其项目现在招募病人变难了，不仅是因为病例减少了，同时诸多没有太大希望的其他研究挤兑了试验资源。
At a press conference on February 24, Bruce Aylward, a senior adviser to the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), revealed that Radeaway clinical trial leader and Sino-Japanese Friendship Hospital, Cao Bin, said his program was now finding it difficult to recruit patients, not only because there were fewer cases, but also because many other studies ran out of hope.
2 月 15 日科技部生物中心主任张新民称，共有 168 例重症病人和 17 例轻症病人正在进行瑞德西韦的临床试验。
Zhang Xinmin, director of the Ministry of Science and Technology's biological centre, said on Feb. 15 that a total of 168 patients with severe and 17 mild cases were undergoing clinical trials with Rhetsevir.
该研究的设计方案中，研究将在武汉金银潭医院等多家接诊的新型冠状病毒感染肺炎患者中进行，首批拟入组病例共计 761 例，其中包括，轻、中症组患者 308 例，重症组患者 453 例。
The study will be carried out in the first batch of 761 cases of coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital, among which 308 cases of mild and moderate cases and 453 cases of severe cases will be included.
最有希望的新冠病毒药物临床研究，入组者远未能满足需求。
The most promising clinical study of new crown virus drugs found that the group was far from meeting demand.
反观另一面则是熙熙攘攘的热闹局面：从 1 月 23 日到 2 月 27 日，在中国临床试验注册中心新型冠状病毒肺炎临床研究索引中已经有 271 个结果。
On the other side of the spectrum is the hustle and bustle of life: 271 results are available from January 23 to February 27 in the clinical research index of the new coronavirus pneumonia at the China Clinical Trial Registration Center.

（来源：中新网）蜂拥而至的众多临床研究抢走了瑞德西韦临床试验大量的患者资源。
(Source: www.sina.com.cn) Numerous clinical studies have siphoned off a huge amount of patient resources from Rhetsevier clinical trials.
艾尔沃德呼吁，应该优先那些可能更有希望的研究项目。
He called for priority to be given to potentially more promising research projects.
DeepTech 经多方了解发现，瑞德西韦试验的高门槛、众多临床试验挤兑是瑞德西韦的困境所在。
DeepTech has learned from many sources that Rhetsevier's high threshold and numerous runs on clinical trials are where Rhetsevier's predicament lies.
那么瑞德西韦研究结局会是怎样呢？入组门槛高以瑞德西韦的重症新冠肺炎临床试验方案为例。
So what will the Rhetsevius study end up doing? Rhetsevir's clinical trial of severe new crown pneumonia is a high-threshold example.
试验开始时间为 2020 年 2 月 6 日，研究完成时间为 2020 年 5 月 1 日。
The test started on 6 February 2020 and the study was completed on 1 May 2020.
这是一项随机、双盲、安慰剂对照的多中心 III 期临床试验。
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter III clinical trial.
试验方案分为实验组和对照组。
The experimental scheme was divided into experimental and control groups.
实验组患者入组第 1 天给予瑞德西韦 200 毫克负荷剂量，之后每天静脉注射 100 毫克，持续治疗 9 天；对照组患者入组第 1 天给予安慰剂 200 毫克，之后每天静脉注射 100 毫克，持续治疗 9 天。
Patients in the control group were given a 200 mg dose of Rhetsevir on the first day, followed by an intravenous injection of 100 mg per day for 9 days, and a placebo of 200 mg per day for the first day and 100 mg per day for 9 days for the control group.
入组的标准有 7 项，其中一项就会排除掉一部分患者，即核酸检测新冠病毒阳性。
There are seven criteria for joining the group, one of which excludes some patients, viz., Nucleic Acid Test New Crown Virus Positive.
因为出于实验室检测缺陷等多种原因，一部分患者多次进行核酸检测阴性，但新冠肺炎症状严重。
Some patients have been tested negative for nucleic acid several times for a variety of reasons, such as laboratory defects, but the new crown pneumonia symptoms are serious.
入组标准中的另一个门槛是距离发病时间小于 12 天。
Another threshold in the entry criteria is less than 12 days from onset.
事实上，很多医院里的住院患者是不在这个时间窗口中，那么也就无法满足这个要求。
In fact, many hospital patients are not in this window of time, then it is impossible to meet this requirement.
入组方案要求患者在筛查评估之前的 30 天内没有接受过任何针对新冠病毒的试验性治疗。
Patients in the cohort were asked not to receive any experimental treatment for the new crown virus within 30 days before the screening assessment.
这个要求让很多患者止步，因为此前有官方或新闻报道推荐某些药物如双黄连口服液，他们可能已经服用过。
The requirement has stopped many patients from taking certain medications, such as Shuanghuanglian oral liquid, that have been recommended by official or news reports.
要知道，这些药物的服用会增加临床研究的不确定因素。
It is important to understand that the use of these drugs increases uncertainty in clinical studies.
武汉大学人民医院一位人士表示，除了上述障碍，还有患者自身意愿的问题，一些患者不同意入组进行试验。
A person at Wuhan University's People's Hospital said that in addition to the above-mentioned obstacles, there is the patient's own will, some patients do not agree to join the group for the test.
官方信息显示，2 月 6 日，首个入组的新冠肺炎患者开始用药，目前还不清楚这位 68 岁的患者是作为试验的一部分还是为了救急。
The 68-year-old patient began taking medication on Feb. 6 as part of a trial or as an emergency, official information said.
10 天后只成功招募了不到 200 人。
After 10 days, less than 200 were successfully recruited.
目前招募到的人数尚不明确。
The current number of recruitments is unclear.
不过，瑞德西韦研究还是有了新的希望。
Still, there is new hope in the Redside study.
2 月 27 日，吉利德科学宣布发起 2 项针对瑞德西韦治疗新型冠状病毒肺炎的临床试验，全球招募 1000 人。
On February 27, Geely Science announced the launch of two clinical trials targeting Rhetsevir for the treatment of a new coronavirus pneumonia, recruiting 1,000 people worldwide.
其中 1 项随机、对照双盲临床试验已在美国内布拉斯加大学医学中心开展。
A randomized, controlled double-blind clinical trial was conducted at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in the United States.
首位入组患者是 1 名从 “钻石公主” 号邮轮撤回的美国人。
The first patient in the group was an American who had been withdrawn from the MV Princess Diamond.
其试验方案与中国方案略有不同。
Its pilot programme is slightly different from that of China.
紧迫的药物实验却因为缺乏合适的患者而速度放缓，这是在疫情期间快速开发药物的重大挑战。
Urgent drug trials are slowing down because of a lack of suitable patients, a major challenge in the rapid development of drugs during an epidemic.
中国的新增感染人数逐渐减少，留给瑞德西韦的时间还有多少？患者资源遭遇挤兑在中国临床试验注册中心 (http://www.chictr.org.cn/) 注册的 271 个新冠病毒研究项目中，包括了治疗性临床试验、诊断试验、干预性研究、观察性研究、流行病学研究。
As the number of new infections in China dwindles, how much time is left for Rhetsevius? The 271 new crown virus research projects registered at the CHRC (http: / / www.chictr.org.cn /) include therapeutic clinical trials, diagnostic tests, interventional studies, observational studies, and epidemiological studies.
271 个注册新冠肺炎的临床试验中，既有洛匹那韦 / 利托那韦这样抗艾滋药物研究，也有脐血间充质干细胞的研究、恢复期血浆治疗的研究、维生素 D 对患者预后的研究、连花清瘟胶囊中成药研究、甘草酸二胺的研究，甚至还有太极拳对患者康复的研究，有健身气功养肺方对患者功能恢复和生活质量的影响研究，有大豆水提物（豆浆）的临床治疗研究。
In 271 clinical trials of registered new crown pneumonia, there have been studies on anti-AIDS drugs such as Lopinavir / Ritonavir, studies on umbilical mesenchymal stem cells, convalescent plasma therapy, vitamin D studies on patient prognosis, lianhua-Qing Capsule, glycyrrhizic acid diamines, and even Taijiquan on patients' functional recovery and quality of life.
当然还有众所周知的双黄连口服液研究。
There is, of course, the well-known Shuanghuanglian oral liquid.
图 | 喝豆浆治疗新冠肺炎的临床研究DeepTech 了解到，在武汉大学人民医院一个科室的 20 多名新冠患者中，就参与了多达 7 个临床试验项目。
Clinical Study of Soybean Milk for New Crown Pneumonia DeepTech knows that as many as seven clinical trials have involved more than 20 new patients in a department of Wuhan University's People's Hospital.
据介绍，该科室的瑞德西韦项目入组患者仅有 2 名。
The department had only two Rhetsevier patients in the group, according to the report.
中国临床试验注册中心查询可知，武汉大学人民医院正在进行的项目至少有 9 个。
China Clinical Trial Registration Center inquiries, Wuhan University People's Hospital is carrying out at least nine projects.
包括连花清瘟胶囊 / 颗粒治疗试验 2 项（针对疑似病例的 1 项和针对确诊病例 的1 项），羟氯喹治疗疗效研究，雾化吸入喜炎平注射液治疗研究，评价羟氯喹对新冠暴露后的密切接触者预防效果的研究，医务工作者新冠肺炎易感因素调查与院内防控策略研究，多脏器超声特征性改变，来氟米特临床试验。
Including Lianhuaqing Distemper Capsule / Particle Therapy Trial 2 (1 for suspected cases and 1 for confirmed cases), therapeutic study of hydroxychloroquine therapy, nebulized inhalation of siphon injection, evaluation of prevention effect of hydroxychloroquine on close contacts after exposure to the new crown, investigation of susceptibility factors of nosocomial pneumonia and nosocomial control strategies, multi-organ ultrasound characteristic changes and leflomide clinical trials.
最近的一个项目是重组人白介素 2 治疗新型冠状病毒肺炎的临床研究，该项目注册时间是 2 月 24 日。
A recent project is the clinical study of recombinant human interleukin-2 in the treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia.
中国临床试验注册中心网站显示，该研究尚未获得伦理委员会批准。
The research has not yet been approved by an ethics committee, according to the website of the China Clinical Trials Registry.
武汉大学人民医院一位医务人员承认，目前病人在变少，各个项目入组难度加大了。
A medical worker at Wuhan University's People's Hospital admitted that the number of patients is decreasing and that it is becoming more difficult to group projects.
业内人士反馈是强烈的。
Feedback from industry sources is strong.
2 月 24 日，《中华流行病学杂志》发表一批卫生统计学与流行病学工作者撰写的《关于科学、规范、有序地开展新型冠状病毒肺炎相关临床试验的建议》提出，除非认为是十分重要的研究，否则需要谨慎。
On February 24, the Chinese Journal of Epidemiology published the Recommendations for Scientific, Normative and Orderly Clinical Trials Related to Coronavirus Pneumonia, written by a group of health statistics and epidemiologists, unless it is considered a very important study.
因为目前是病例积压最多、临床最困难的时候，是降低病死率、提高治愈率的关键时刻，要尽量避免对临床救治的干扰，避免增加临床工作的负担。
Because the current backlog of cases, the most difficult clinical time, is to reduce the fatality rate, improve the cure rate, to avoid interference in clinical treatment, to avoid increasing the burden of clinical work.
这篇文章通讯作者系中山大学郝元涛、广州市妇女儿童医疗中心唐金陵 、复旦大学姜庆五和北京大学李立明。
This article is written by Hao Yuan Tao of Zhongshan University, Tang Jinling of Guangzhou Medical Center for Women and Children, Jiang Qingwu of Fudan University and Li Liming of Peking University.
他们指出，项目众多，而患者数量已经不能满足研究要求，这会导致研究难以获得预期结论。
They noted that the large number of projects and the fact that the number of patients could no longer meet research requirements made it difficult to reach the expected conclusions.
如果样本量不足，对照组的选择不合理，临床研究就难以提供高质量的有效性和安全性证据，使得受试患者、研究者和管理部门的努力付诸东流。
If the sample size is insufficient and the control group's choice is unreasonable, it is difficult for clinical research to provide high quality evidence of efficacy and safety.
有专家质疑说，很多临床医生不是专门从事研究的，他们在抗疫第一线有多少时间来真正做这研究？如果这种情况持续下去，那些拥有最多的病人的机构可能最终得到的是糟糕的临床研究结果，因为有能力无条件的人无法进行研究，有条件能力不足的人却将患者资源据为己有。
If this situation persists, institutions with the largest number of patients may end up with poor clinical findings, because those who are able to do so are unable to conduct research, and those who are unable to afford it appropriate patient resources.
曹彬怎么办？图 | 2 月 5 日，瑞德西韦临床试验项目负责人、中日友好医院副院长曹彬教授讲解瑞德西韦项目内容。
What about Cao Bin? Rhett Butler, director of the Rhetsevier Clinical Trial Program and Vice President of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Hospital, spoke about Rhetsevier on February 5.
（来源：新华社）如果不能满足当初的试验设计会怎样？曹彬没有回应我们的采访请求。
Cao Bin did not respond to our request for an interview if he could not satisfy the original test design.
不少业内看法认为，非常时期无需减持这么严谨、操作上也有困难的设计，可以考虑在样本量和试验设计上作些让步。
A number of industry views that the extraordinary period does not need to reduce so strict, also difficult to operate the design, you can consider in the sample size and test design some concessions.
有多位学者为瑞德西韦项目给出建议，可以考虑放宽招募标准，增加招募中心，延长招募时间。
A number of academics have suggested that the Redgrave project could consider relaxing recruitment criteria, increasing recruitment centers and lengthening recruitment time.
对于前者，可以考虑不仅限于发病时间在 12 天以内的要求，而是放宽到更长时间。
For the former, consideration could be given to extending the period beyond the 12-day limit to a longer period.
对于后者，可以增加方舱医院作为轻、中度病人的招募中心，还可以考虑增加武汉之外地区的患者。
With regard to the latter, the use of square-cabin hospitals as recruitment centres for light and medium-sized patients could be increased, as could the number of patients outside Wuhan.
但前述《中华流行病学杂志》文章不认可对临床研究进行调整的做法，“这些想法也许初衷是好的，但后果往往是得不出可靠的结论，也就是对患者不负责任”。
But the aforementioned article in the Chinese Journal of Epidemiology does not endorse adjustments to clinical research. "These ideas may have been well-intentioned, but the result is often unreliable conclusions, that is, irresponsible treatment of patients."
药智网联合创始人李天泉对 DeepTech 表示，既然临床试验方案确定了，原则上是应该严格按照注册方案来进行的，方案要调整可能会带来很多麻烦，比如合作医院的前期培训要增加等等。
Lee Tian-chuen, co-founder of Pharmacokinetics, told DeepTech that since clinical trials have been identified, clinical trials should in principle be carried out in strict accordance with registration protocols, which can cause problems, such as increased pre-training at cooperative hospitals.
李天泉建议，可以考虑采取行政手段，优先保证那些更有潜力的临床研究入组。
Mr Lee suggests that administrative measures could be considered to prioritize clinical studies with greater potential.
当然最好的一个结果是，如果瑞德西韦疗效显著，那么较小样本也能有说服力。
The best result, of course, is that if Rhetsevir is effective, the smaller samples will be convincing.
不过鉴于新冠肺炎是自限性疾病，即使不进行相应抗病毒治疗也有可能治愈，那么就减弱了小样本研究的说服力。
But given that new crown pneumonia is self-limiting, it is possible to cure it without corresponding antiviral treatment, which weakens the power of small-sample studies.
原北京协和医学院教授、从事免疫治疗药物研发的王晨光博士认为，行政手段干预临床研究项目上马的做法并不乐观。
Dr. Wang Chenguang, a former professor at Beijing Concorde Medical School and a researcher of immunotherapy drugs, said the practice of administrative intervention in clinical research projects was not encouraging.
毕竟目前国家政策是大力推进中医药发展，管理部门可能对延缓某些中医药项目畏手畏脚。
After all, China's current policy is to aggressively promote Chinese medicine, and regulators may balk at delaying some Chinese medicine projects.
需要强调的是，循证才是金标准美国国立卫生研究院下属国家过敏症和传染病研究所主任安东尼 · 福奇 (Anthony Fauci) 称，美国迫切需要一种安全有效的新冠肺炎疗法，而随机的安慰剂对照临床试验是判断试验性疗法的黄金标准。
Evidence is the gold standard, says Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health.
福奇提到的金标准正是循证医学的内容。
The gold standard that Fauci refers to is what evidence-based medicine is all about.
与传统医学的不同处是，循证医学并不依赖于经验主义或过往案例，随机对照试验才是循证医学证据的主要来源。
Unlike traditional medicine, evidence-based medicine does not rely on empiricism or past cases, and randomized controlled trials are the main source of evidence-based medical evidence.
比如北京大学第一医院呼吸和危重症医学科主任王广发口中对其有效的“洛匹那韦利托那韦片”，该药曾在国家卫生健康委员会颁布的《新型冠状病毒肺炎诊疗方案（试行第二版）》中被推荐试用。
For example, Wang Guangfa, director of respiratory and critical medicine at Peking University Hospital No. 1, has been recommended for trial in the new Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment (Trial Version 2), published by the National Board of Health and Health.
然而在上海市公共卫生临床中心团队发表于《中华传染病杂志》的研究中未发现该药能改善症状。
However, in a study published in the Chinese Journal of Infectious Diseases by the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre team, the drug was not found to improve symptoms.
中国循证医学中心创建主任李幼平教授在 2014 年《世界卫生组织简报》中表示，许多人不了解循证医学是什么，质疑循证医学对中国有什么用。
'Many people don't understand what evidence-based medicine is, and question the usefulness of evidence-based medicine for China, 'Professor Li Youping, founder of the China Centre for Evidence-based Medicine, said in the 2014 WHO Bulletin.
中国生产的有一些临床证据还不符合国际标准，主要因为没有足够的合格研究者，对临床试验的监管也不够。
Some of the clinical evidence produced in China does not meet international standards, mainly because there are not enough qualified researchers and regulation of clinical trials is inadequate.
李幼平于 2007 年领导创建了中国临床试验注册中心，成为世卫组织国际临床试验注册平台的一级注册机构。
In 2007, Li led the creation of the China Clinical Trials Registry, which became the primary registry for the WHO International Clinical Trials Registration Platform.
最近一篇刷屏的自媒体文章《循证的崩溃》称，循证医学在中国本来就虚弱得可怜，在暴虐的新冠病毒面前，已经濒于全面崩溃。
Evidence-based medicine, already woefully weak in China, is on the verge of total collapse in the face of the oppressive new crown virus, according to a recent screen-brushing article, Evidence-Based Collapse.
众多临床试验中，不管是化学药物还是传统药物，或者是恢复期患者的血浆疗法，大都没有做到严格遵守循证医学原则。
In many clinical trials, there is a lack of strict adherence to evidence-based medical principles, whether in the form of chemotherapy, traditional medicine or plasma therapy for convalescent patients.
《中华流行病学杂志》文章也指出，因为 SARS 时期我们有了足够的教训，不能再犯这类错误。
The article in the Chinese Journal of Epidemiology also points out that we have learned enough from SARS not to make such mistakes again.
治疗无效不等于没有副作用，尤其是在这个时候，不允许将无效药物的风险转嫁给患者。
Ineffective treatment does not mean that there are no side effects, especially at this time, the risk of ineffective drugs being passed on to the patient is not allowed.
瑞德西韦的研究是极少数有望坚持循证医学的项目之一。
Rhetsevier's research is one of the few projects that promises to adhere to evidence-based medicine.
需要说明的是，曹彬的瑞德西韦研究是在美国临床试验数据库 (ClinicalTrials.gov ) 注册的。
It should be noted that Cao Bin's Rhetto study was registered in the US Clinical Trials.gov database.
一位循证医学权威专家在接受 DeepTech 采访时指出，曹彬的瑞德西韦试验是一个举世瞩目的临床研究，建议他完全按照预先设计的方案，所有的入组条件不能改变，即使最终的研究结果说服力不够，但至少其研究结果可以让后来者作为原始依据进行二次研究。
In an interview with DeepTech, an expert in evidence-based medicine noted that Cao Bin's Rhetsevier trial was a remarkable clinical study, suggesting that he follow exactly the pre-designed protocol, that all entry conditions remain unchanged, and that even if the final results are not convincing, at least the latter can be used as the original basis for a second study.
该专家表示，如果说非要改变入组条件，就要将符合严格标准的分为一组，放宽标准的分为一组，这样也至少能够尽量避免患者入组标准前后不一带来的影响。
The expert expressed the view that, if there was a need to change the criteria for inclusion, it would be necessary to group those who met the strict criteria and to group those who relaxed the criteria, so as to at least minimize the impact of inconsistent criteria for inclusion.
王晨光也指出，此次疫情中大量患者本来是极为珍贵的医疗资源，如果没有利用得当，那么就白白浪费了医学资源，辜负了疫情受害者的牺牲，并且这些不当作为可能在下一次疫情来袭时再度上演，那才是一个最糟糕的结局。
Wang also pointed out that the outbreak of a large number of patients are extremely valuable medical resources, if not properly used, then waste medical resources, live up to the victims of the epidemic, and these improper as the next epidemic may occur again, that is the worst possible outcome.
-End-附件：从 1 月 23 日到 2 月 27 日，在中国临床试验注册中心新型冠状病毒肺炎临床研究索引中已经有 271 个结果。
