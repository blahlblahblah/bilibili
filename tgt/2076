"Our emergency patients have not been interrupted," said Professor Luo Shun of the Shanghai Chest Hospital. "For patients from some key affected areas, the hospital needs time-limited isolation. For patients with severe emergencies, our care has not stopped.
”对于肺癌病人，如果是早期患者（磨玻璃结节大概只有8毫米左右），可以推迟手术时间；如果是早期但有淋巴结转移的病人，按期手术；如果能够通过口服药解决的晚期患者，通过长处方减少去医院的次数；只有那些需要化疗的晚期病人，才需要按时进行治疗。
For lung cancer patients, surgery can be delayed if the patient is an early sufferer (grinding glass nodules of about 8 millimetres), scheduled surgery if the patient is early but has lymph node metastasis, less frequent hospital visits through long-term prescriptions if patients are able to be treated orally, and regular treatment is required only for those with advanced chemotherapy needs.
而且，现在患者都要通过预约，临时加号不允许哦！对于那些对病情有疑问有担心又不方便来医院就诊的癌症患者，陆舜教授联合全国百位肿瘤领域专家和医生，利用业余时间为患者做直播答疑，开通了免费义诊渠道——“肺凡力量”公益线上义诊。
