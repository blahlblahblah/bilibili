摘要：一句“我不怕”的背后，可以有千百个理由。
There are hundreds of reasons why I am not afraid.
新冠肺炎的阴影尚未散去，不少地区已经陆续复工。
The shadow of the new crown pneumonia has not yet dissipated, many areas have resumed work.
人们正在努力重建自己的工作和生活，同时，也有一部分人从未离开，始终坚守在岗位上。
People are trying to rebuild their jobs and lives, while others never leave and stick to their posts.
疫情之下，劳动者们面临怎样的挑战，又如何应对？什么是她们最大的担忧和牵挂？我们将镜头对准不同行业的女性劳动者，希望聚焦于她们的面容和声音。
What challenges do workers face and how do they respond to the epidemic? What are their greatest concerns and concerns? We aim our cameras at female workers in different industries, hoping to focus on their faces and voices.
何姨 环卫工“都没什么的。
"It's nothing," said Aunt Ho.
”何姨今年过年没有回家，不是因为疫情，而是因为工作。
"Aunt Ho didn't come home this New Year, not because of the epidemic, but because of work.
按规定，她每年有5天年假，但公司总是早早就催员工把假休完，到了过年，就不让休假。
She is required to take five days off a year, but the company always nudges employees to take leave early.
何姨对此的理解是，“休了就没人扫马路，没人搞卫生啦”。
Aunt He understands this, "no one sweeps the road, no one does the cleaning."
疫情的到来反而让她的工作稍显轻松，平时每周只有一天休息日，现在出于安全方面的考虑，员工一周可以休两天。
The arrival of the outbreak has made her job a little easier, with only one day off a week, and now employees can take two days off a week for safety reasons.
除此之外，这件事对她的生活影响有限。
Besides, it had a limited effect on her life.
环卫工的工作量很大，每天早上5点半，天还没亮，她就要出门，上班期间要保持自己负责的区域卫生，就意味着要几乎一刻不停地走来走去。
The sanitation worker's workload is very heavy, every morning at 5: 30, before dawn, she has to go out to work, to maintain their own responsible regional health, means almost constantly walking around.
何姨说，她忙得连新闻都没时间看，也不知道疫情扩散有多严重、出现了多少病例。
She was so busy she didn't even have time to watch the news, she said. She didn't know how widespread the outbreak was or how many cases it had.
现在每天上班，班长都会来发口罩、量体温，体温记录要上报给公司。
Now every day at work, the monitor will come to a mask, temperature measurement, temperature records to be reported to the company.
这些例行措施并没有让何姨更担心自己的处境——出来工作挣钱，怕不怕都是要干的，每天干活权当锻炼身体了。
These routine measures do not make Aunt He more worried about her situation - to work for money, afraid to do all the work, working every day when the right to exercise.
因为还能上班，家庭的经济状况也没有受到影响，“挺好的”。
The family's financial situation has not been affected because they are still able to go to work.
工作间隙，她谈起老家上大学的女儿，说不知道她现在读书怎么样，成绩好不好。
Between work, she talked about her daughter who went to college in her hometown and said she didn't know how she was doing and how well she was doing.
大学学费很高，是一笔不小的开支。
University tuition is very high, which is not a small expense.
晓红 外卖送餐员“再怎么保护好，要传染也传染上了。
Xiaohong takeaway delivery man "how to protect good, to infect also infected.
”作为外卖送餐“骑手”，对于疫情给人们生活造成的影响，晓红和她的同事感受非常深刻。
Xiao Hong and her colleagues are impressed by the impact of the epidemic on people's lives as "riders" delivering takeaway meals.
晓红回忆，年前开始，就有很多人在网上买口罩，她每天不停地送口罩，心里还觉得很奇怪。
Xiaohong recalled that many people began to buy masks online years ago. She kept sending them every day, which made her feel strange.
当时公司上下都没有意识到情况严重，“根本没有想到会有那么吓人的病”，骑手自己都没戴口罩，照旧送货上门。
At the time, the company did not realize that the situation was serious, "did not expect such a terrible disease," the rider himself did not wear masks, and still delivered goods.
等她意识到要买口罩的时候，到处都已经卖完了。
By the time she realized she needed to buy a mask, it was sold out everywhere.
大年初一，公司召开紧急会议，这才给所有人配备了口罩和消毒水。
On New Year's Day, the company held an emergency meeting, then all equipped with masks and disinfectant.
到了初二，晓红开始感觉害怕。
In the second day of junior high school, xiao hong began to feel afraid.
她去超市拿货，碰到了抢购粮食的“恐怖”场面。
She went to the supermarket to pick up the goods, encountered a "terrible" scene of snapping up grain.
原本过年期间工作量应该不大，但那几天抢货把她累得够呛。
The amount of work was supposed to be small during the Spring Festival, but the days of snapping up goods exhausted her.
很快，小区和城中村开始限制人员进出，她的主要工作也从送餐变成了送菜送粮。
Soon, the neighborhood and the village began to restrict the movement of people, her main work from food delivery to food delivery.
最开始进村要出示身份证，凡是湖北的一律不给进。
At the beginning of the village to produce identity cards, Hubei will not be given access to.
晓红替湖北的同事抱不平：很多人几年都没回过家了，也被“一杆子打死”。
Xiaohong for Hubei colleagues aggrieved: many people have not returned home for several years, was also "a rod of death."
还有的村规定“人可以进，车不能进”，晓红觉得好笑：“是人传播病毒，又不是车子传播病毒。
There are also village rules "people can enter, cars can not enter," Xiaohong felt funny: "It is the human transmission of the virus, not the car transmission virus.
”村子很大，她靠双腿徒步送了几天，封村的规定又下来了，外卖从此只能送到村口，等客户自己出来取。
The village was so large that she walked for several days on both legs, and the village regulations came down again.
忙乱之余，送餐员有时在一起开玩笑，有人说自己还是怕死的，别人在车里装一瓶消毒水，他装了两瓶。
In his hurry, the waiter sometimes joked with each other. Some said they were afraid of death. He filled two bottles with disinfectant in the car.
但另一方面，他们也是最“不怕死”的。
But on the other hand, they are also the most fearless.
晓红担心归担心，心底却有一股近乎“听天命”的豁达，“天天在外面跑，再怎么保护好，要传染也传染上了”。
Xiao Hong worried, but in the bottom of my heart, there is a close to "listen to fate" of open-minded, "every day outside, how to protect good, to infect also infected."
她让家人不要来广州看她，但自己没想过要回老家，毕竟回去还要隔离，不如留下来工作。
She told her family not to come to Guangzhou to see her, but she did not want to go home, after all, to go back to isolation, rather than stay to work.
家里的亲戚很羡慕她，她们连续一两个月没有班上，而她至少还有收入。
Relatives envied her for not having a class for a month or two, and she had at least an income.
刘姐 菜市商贩“肯定会有点影响。
Liu Jie vegetable market vendors "will certainly have a bit of impact.
”往年年初八就恢复营业的菜市场，今年才刚开始复苏。
The market, which had reopened on the eighth day of the previous year, had only just begun to recover this year.
刘姐从老家回到广州，在家“自我隔离”了半个月，如今安顿好上网课的孩子，自己出来做生意。
Liu Jie from her hometown back to Guangzhou, at home "self-isolation" for half a month, now settled the children online classes, their own business.
在物资储备方面，刘姐家算是比较“幸运”。
In the material reserves, the Liu sisters are relatively "lucky."
家里有地，有鱼塘，还养了鸡，即使疫情期间买不到菜，也不愁没有过年的口粮。
The family has land, fish pond, but also kept chickens, even during the outbreak of the disease can not buy food, there is no shortage of food.
她年三十那天看朋友圈，才知道广州的超市已经被抢购一空。
When she saw her friends on the thirtieth day, she knew that the supermarket in Guangzhou had been sold out.
酒精和消毒水在家里也能买到，唯一的麻烦是口罩，药店都卖完了，最后是托了别人，才拿到10个。
Alcohol and disinfectant are also available at home. The only problem is the masks, which are sold out. Finally, we entrust someone else with 10.
5块钱一个的价格，如今看来也不算高。
Five dollars a price does not seem very high now.
回到城里，刘姐觉得赋闲在家的生活有点无聊。
Back in the city, Liu felt a little bored living at home.
不能做生意，不能出门打牌，不能聚餐，只能在家里整天看电视、睡觉。
Can't do business, can't play cards, can't have a meal, can only watch TV and sleep at home all day.
经济状况多少也受到影响，不能挣钱，花钱的地方却一样没少。
The state of the economy has been somewhat affected, with no income to be made and no less money to be spent.
“你坐在家里也要吃饭，也要交房租是不是？”疫情尚未结束，但人们都要生活，要吃饭，要买菜。
"You sit at home and eat and pay rent, don't you?" The epidemic is not over, but people have to live, eat and buy food.
刘姐家的店铺又开张了。
The Liu sisters' shop opened again.
吴姨 社区志愿者“肯定有压力的啦。
"There must be pressure on Aunt Wu volunteers.
”吴姨是广州本地人，2月5号开始，她作为业主参与到自己所在城中村的执勤工作，在村口给居民做出入信息登记，操着不太熟练的普通话应对来来往往的人。
Wu, a native of Guangzhou, began work as an owner on duty in her inner-city village on February 5, checking in and out of residents at the entrance to the village and dealing with people coming and going with less proficient Mandarin.
对于这份志愿工作，她说得言简意赅：“都轮不到你害不害怕。
For this volunteer work, she said succinctly: "It's not your turn to be afraid.
这么多外地人回来，（我们就）来值班咯。
So many foreigners come back that (we) are on duty.
”据吴姨说，疫情期间出去找不到工作，家里的房子又不允许出租，即使是本地人，也要面临一定的经济压力。
Even locals who are unable to find work outside the epidemic and whose homes are not allowed to be rented face some economic pressure, according to Wu.
阿丽 服装销售“你在家里待久了，真的很想上班吗？”拍摄进行到一半，阿丽突然说：“我帮你消个毒先。
Halfway through the shoot, Ally suddenly said, "I'll help you kill the poison first.
”拿出酒精对着摄影师喷了一通。
"Take out the alcohol and spray it at the photographer.
像许多独居的年轻人一样，她在复工之前过了一段每天穿着睡衣在家里吃泡面的日子。
Like many young people living alone, she spent a day at home eating noodles in her pajamas before returning to work.
阿丽庆幸自己过年前多买了两套睡衣，立刻就派上了用场。
Ally is glad she bought two more sets of pajamas before the New Year and immediately put them to use.
身边有人早早屯了大量口罩，对疫情扩散充满紧张的阿丽反而没有屯，因为觉得这是一种“很羞耻的行为”：“你屯我屯，大家都买不到了，没得用的人怎么办？”她只买了够自己一个人用的量。
Some people have been around early on a large number of masks, but the spread of the spread of the disease Ai Li did not, because it is a "very ashamed behavior": "you and I, we can not buy, no use for people?" She only bought enough for her own use.
拍摄当天只有一个客人上门，气氛十分悠闲。
There was only one guest on the day of the shooting, and the atmosphere was leisurely.
阿丽诚实地表示，自己压根不想上班，在家躺了一个月，出来无非是想走走、散散心，再就是得有钱进账——在疫情造成的所有影响中，“没钱”这点才最为重要。
Ally said honestly that she didn't want to go to work at all, but stayed at home for a month, came out just for a walk, to relax and to have money to buy - and that "no money" was the most important of all the effects of the epidemic.
李姨 门卫“你看到，我没有休息一天。
Aunt Li: You see, I didn't take a day off.
”李姨过年没有回家，和往年没有什么不同。
Aunt Li didn't come home for the New Year.
她的工作常年无休，请假就要扣钱。
Her work is so constant that she has to take time off work.
其实原本每月应该有4天休假，但门卫一个月工资只有2100，如果休息日加班，一天能补70块钱，为了这每个月的280元，李姨都尽量坚持不休息。
But the janitor gets 2,100 yuan a month. If she works overtime, she gets 70 yuan a day. For 280 yuan a month, Aunt Li tries not to rest.
她和老公两人都是门卫，到了晚上，老公会来接她的班。
She and her husband are both guards, in the evening, her husband will come to pick up her class.
两人微薄的工资，要供养身体不好的一儿一女。
Two people's meager wages, to support a son and a daughter who are not well.
女儿今年还在读高三，不仅要交学费，一周的药费也要一千多。
My daughter is still in her third year of high school. Not only will she have to pay school fees, but she will also have to pay more than 1,000 a week.
医生说药需要连吃3个月，李姨希望这3个月能让女儿痊愈：“（病）能断根就好了，没有断根（以后）医不起啊。
The doctor said it would take three months for the medicine to last. Aunt Li hoped that she would be able to heal her in three months.
”家里的钱都用来填窟窿了，没有什么积蓄，如今李姨和老公住着一个很小的单间，一个月房租700。
They had no savings. Now Aunt Li and her husband lived in a small single room, which they rented for 700 a month.
她有点心疼地算了笔账：刚住了两个月，算上押金，一共就交了两千多，还要交卫生费、水电费，再加上日常生活和老家的开支……女儿现在也在这里暂住。
She had just lived for two months, after which she had paid more than two thousand dollars, plus the cost of health care and utilities, as well as the daily expenses and the expenses of her hometown.
李姨没买智能手机，上不了网，“病毒”相关的资讯都是女儿告诉她的。
Aunt Li didn't buy a smartphone, she couldn't access the Internet, and she was the one who told her about the virus.
单位没有给员工发口罩，让他们自己买，说等疫情过去再报销，也多亏女儿早早买好了备在家里。
The unit did not give staff masks, let them buy their own, said that the epidemic in the past to reimburse, but also thanks to her daughter early bought ready at home.
刚开始李姨不觉得情况严重，说戴口罩不舒服，不想戴，女儿让她忍一忍，一定要戴上：“命是最重要呀！”阿幸 医务工作者“我不怕。
At first Aunt Li didn't think it was serious. She said she didn't feel comfortable wearing a mask. She told her to put up with it.
”阿幸在一家社区卫生服务中心负责传染病防控相关工作。
Ashin is in charge of infectious disease control at a community health service center.
疫情扩散后，社区中心的医务人员积极加入疫情防控工作中，早出晚归，有时安排24小时值班，甚至30多小时超负荷工作。
After the spread of the epidemic, community center medical staff actively participate in the prevention and control of the epidemic, early and late, sometimes arrange 24-hour duty, even more than 30 hours of overwork.
阿幸就是其中一员，每天要一户户上门，给湖北回来的居民做健康随访。
Ashin is one of them, every day to a door, Hubei residents back to do health follow-up.
基层医务人员紧缺，防护物资不足，作为一线防控人员生命安全得不到基本保障，但是大家都认为在灾难面前有义务出一份力，也可以说是职业本身的牵绊，认为守护居民的健康是职责所在，因此几乎没有怨言。
There is a shortage of primary-level medical personnel, inadequate protective materials, as a first-line prevention and control personnel do not have the basic security of life, but we all think in the face of disasters, can be said to play a role in the job itself, guarding the health of the residents is a duty, so there are few complaints.
她说，自己已经“做到麻木”，对时间都失去了概念。
She said she was "numb" and had lost all sense of time.
在连做了6天的随访工作后，由于工作强度引起的机体疲惫，她开始出现肌肉酸痛、胸闷、头痛等症状，担心自己会成为“无症状感染者”，在工作中传染给别人。
After six days of follow-up, she began to suffer from muscle soreness, chest tightness and headaches caused by the intensity of her work, fearing that she would become an asymptomatic infector and infect others at work.
她给自己安排了检查，等待结果的时候，在家里睡了整整两天——身体在发出警报，提醒她需要休息。
She scheduled a checkup for herself and, while waiting for the result, slept at home for two days - her body was alerting her to the need for rest.
可阿幸说不累，还想着参与社区志愿服务，继续工作下去。
But Ah Shein said she was not tired, but also wanted to participate in the community volunteer service, continue to work.
体检结果出来了，没有感染，她又立刻回到了岗位上。
The results showed no infection, and she immediately returned to her post.
站在对抗疫情的第一线，每天要接触大量的人，同时不断听到医护人员感染的新闻报道，内心是否有过动摇和害怕？阿幸说她不怕，多年的工作经验让她心里有底，对她来说，最重要的是如何安抚居民的恐慌，更迅速地开展工作。
Standing at the forefront of the fight against the epidemic, she was exposed to large numbers of people every day and heard news reports of health-care workers being infected, was she shaken and frightened? Ah Sheen said she was not afraid.
“我不怕。
"I'm not afraid.
这次疫情已经夺走很多人，包括我们医务人员的宝贵生命，我怕的是再不努力采取行动把疫情控制下来，下一个生命受到威胁的，可能会是身边最重要的人。
The epidemic has claimed many lives, including those of our medical staff, and I fear that without any further efforts to bring the epidemic under control, the next life may be the most important person around.
”黄姨 保洁员“知道怕死的话都不干这个活了。
Aunt Huang "knows not to do it if you're afraid of death.
”最早得知疫情的时候，黄姨干活还是不戴口罩。
Aunt Huang worked without a mask when she first learned of the outbreak.
小区里的居民路过看见，有人问：“阿姨你不戴口罩啊？”黄姨说没事，自己不怕死，“知道怕死的话都不干这个活了”。
Residents in the neighborhood saw, someone asked: "Auntie you do not wear a mask?" Huang said nothing, his fear of death, "know fear of death do not do this job."
不过随着形势慢慢严峻，最后她还是戴上了。
But as things began to get tough, she finally put them on.
口罩物业没发——名义上，黄姨和她老公算是“承包”的这份清扫工作，因此除了每月5000的报酬，口罩、手套这些劳保用品，包括垃圾袋、消毒水、洗洁精，基本都需要他们自己购买。
Masks don't appear - Aunt Huang and her husband are nominally "contracted" to do the cleaning, so they basically have to buy them themselves, in addition to the 5,000 a month they are paid to wear masks and gloves, including garbage bags, disinfectant and detergent.
黄姨用的口罩是以前别人搬家丢掉的，她“捡”了出来，一包包还是新的，现在派上了用场。
Huang's mask had been thrown away by someone else's previous move. She had "picked it up" and a new bag was now in use.
刚开始她不舍得用，一个口罩戴两三天，现在家里还剩一二十个。
At first she was reluctant to use one mask for two or three days, and now there were only a score left in the house.
特殊时期，清扫垃圾的活在别人看来可能很危险，但黄姨的心态并没有什么改变。
In special times, garbage removal may seem dangerous to others, but Aunt Huang's mentality has not changed much.
她的仔细有目共睹，居委会来检查，都夸她打扫得干净。
Her careful to see, the neighborhood committee came to check, all praised her clean.
黄姨觉得这是理所当然的事情：“既然要干，就要弄干净，嫌脏肯定就不干了。
Aunt Huang took it for granted: "Since I had to do it, I had to clean it up.
”附：摄影师手记这次拍摄和访谈都是用街访的形式完成的，过程中非常紧张，怕每一次来之不易的机会被突然中断，每一次都争分夺秒。
Note: Photographers remember that both the shooting and the interview were done in the form of street visits, with great tension in the process, fearing that every hard-won opportunity would be abruptly interrupted, each time in a hurry.
被拒绝了很多次，但还是想抓住每一个可能，多试一试。
Rejected many times, but still want to seize every possibility, try again.
过程中听到最感人的一句话是：“申请未能批准，但是谢谢你为我们女性发声。
One of the most moving words I heard on the way was, "The application wasn't approved, but thank you for making your voice heard for us women.
”感到一切都是值得的。
"Feeling that it was all worthwhile.
真心地谢谢每一位愿意接受采访和拍摄的朋友。
Thank you very much to everyone who would like to be interviewed and filmed.
