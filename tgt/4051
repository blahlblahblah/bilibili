近期，关于代购的热点新闻频出。
Recently, there has been a heated debate on outsourcing.
海外疫情集中暴发，随之而来的封国、停航、封仓、暂停销售等一系列举措让代购事业瞬间陷入绝境。
Outbreak of concentrated epidemic abroad, with the ensuing sealing, stopping, closing, suspension of sales and a series of other measures so as to buy the cause of instant shipwreck.
根据艾媒咨询数据，2018年中国跨境电商交易规模已达到9.1万亿元，用户规模超1亿。
By 2018, according to Aixin consulting data, the scale of cross-border e-commerce transactions in China reached 9.1 trillion yuan, with more than 100 million users.
在特殊时期，不少代购均表示无法出门扫货，在未来很长一段时间内将会面临“失业”的境遇。
During the special period, many agents said they could not go out to sweep the goods, in the future for a long time will face "unemployment" situation.
同时，疫情之下乱象频出，近日，北京市昌平区居民徐女士举报邻居代购回国后未隔离引发热议。
Meanwhile, the outbreak of chaos under the recent Beijing Changping District residents Xu reported that neighbors did not separate after the purchase triggered hot discussions.
而让人意外的是，经警方调查，被举报者并无出入境记录，随后其爱人证实其并未出国。
Surprisingly, the police investigation revealed that the informant had no entry or exit record and his wife subsequently confirmed that he had not left the country.
也有铤而走险者，日前，北京市公安局前期曾将36名频繁前往韩国从事代购的人员查获并转送至指定地点集中隔离观察。
Recently, the Beijing Public Security Bureau had seized and transferred to designated places 36 persons who had travelled frequently to South Korea for purchase.
此外，《中国经营报》记者调查发现，代购领域假冒伪劣产品层出不穷，掩人耳目的手段也越发高明。
In addition, China Business News reporters found that the buying field of fake and inferior products endless, and more sophisticated means of concealment.
同时，随着海外品牌在国内市场纷纷开设网店，进行营销活动，代购原本赖以生存的“价格优势”也已不复存在。
At the same time, with the establishment of overseas brands in the domestic market, marketing activities, buying on behalf of the original survival of the "price advantage" has ceased to exist.
海外疫情暴发 代购何去何从受疫情持续影响，目前全球至少有30个国家宣布进入紧急状态，随之而来的封国、停航、封仓、暂停销售等一系列举措让代购事业瞬间陷入绝境。
Outbreak buying continues to be affected by the epidemic, with at least 30 countries declaring a state of emergency, followed by a series of closures, suspensions, closures and sales suspensions that have plunged the agency into a corner.
在天津从事日韩产品代购工作的李丽（化名）表示，目前都不敢铤而走险出国进货，但之前囤的货已经快要售罄，也想过通过邮寄的方式再囤一批货，但高昂的运费以及漫长的物流让其打消了这个念头。
Li Li (not her real name), who works as a buying agent for Japanese and South Korean products in Tianjin, said she didn't dare go out of the country at the moment because the store was running out of supplies and thought of sending another consignment by mail, but the high cost of shipping and long logistics stopped the idea.
她表示自己是专职代购，在未来很长一段时间自己将面临“失业”的困境。
She said she was a full-time buying agent and would face "unemployment" for a long time to come.
“海外疫情暴发，已经不能飞往各国扫货了。
"Outbreak outbreak, can no longer fly to all countries to sweep goods.
”姜女士告诉记者，这对其业务开展造成了很大影响，因此她决定转型销售国产品牌的护肤品。
Ms. Kang told reporters that the impact on her business was so great that she decided to switch to selling local brands of skincare.
对此，北京京商流通战略研究院院长赖阳表示，如今疫情蔓延，代购行业以及跨境贸易开始陷入困境。
Now the epidemic is spreading and the buying industry and cross-border trade are in trouble, said Lai Yang, dean of the Beijing Institute of Business Communication Strategies.
目前代购基本不能够出国采购货物，如果冒险出国扫货，一旦隔离就需要付出更高的成本。
At present, buying goods on behalf of the foreign countries is basically impossible, if the venture abroad to sweep goods, once isolated will have to pay higher costs.
另外，目前疫情加重，国外很多工厂开始停工，生产规模缩小，导致产品断货，价格就会上涨，代购的利润空间就会被大大削弱。
In addition, the current increase in the epidemic, many foreign factories began to shut down, the scale of production has been reduced, leading to product outages, prices will rise, and the profit margin for buying will be greatly reduced.
“但目前最难的是物流，重要的医疗物资运输占据主要物流渠道，代购将货物运回国的运输成本和运输周期相应增加。
"But what is most difficult right now is logistics, where the transport of vital medical supplies takes up the major logistics channels, and the cost of shipping goods back home and the shipping cycle increase correspondingly."
总的来说，商品短缺、价格上涨、物流成本增加等都是压在代购身上的难题，代购行业势必会经历一场巨大的冲击。
Generally speaking, the commodity shortage, the price increase, the logistics cost increase are all in the buying on behalf of the difficult problem, the buying industry is bound to experience a huge impact.
”赖阳告诉《中国经营报》记者。
Mr Lai told China Business News.
实际上，海外疫情只是导火索，不少代购人早已意识到了自身已没有了价格优势。
In fact, the overseas epidemic is only the fuse, many agents have long recognized that they have no price advantage.
“现在做代购的人很多，竞争也比较大。
"There are a lot of people buying on behalf of, and there's a lot of competition.
而且专柜的虽然价格高，但是有很多赠品。
And although the counter price is high, but there are many gifts.
代购在免税店买的产品几乎是没有赠品的，就算某些品牌有赠品，也必须要买够一定金额才能获得。
Products bought on behalf of duty-free stores are rarely complimentary, and even if some brands have a gift, they have to buy enough to get them.
这样折算下来，代购的价格并没有优势，因此没有办法打价格战了。
This conversion down, the purchase price does not have an advantage, so there is no way to play the price war.
”姜女士告诉记者，代购这一行已经很难做了。
Ms Kang told reporters that buying for the industry was already difficult.
同时，目前越来越多的海外品牌开始在国内市场探索更多的渠道模式。
At the same time, more and more overseas brands are beginning to explore more channels in the domestic market.
据《中国经营报》此前报道，高丝集团是日本第三大化妆品集团，目前该集团旗下品牌包括高丝、ALBION、雪肌精、Jill Stuart、Addiction、黛珂，已经在天猫或天猫国际开出旗舰店，这6家旗舰店累计粉丝数量现已超过400万。
As previously reported by China Business Daily, Goss is the third largest cosmetics group in Japan, and its brands, including Goss, ALBION, Snowflake, Jill Stuart, Addiction and Deckert, have opened flagship stores in the sky or cat international, with a total fan base of more than four million.
有代购告诉记者，现在越来越多的海外品牌在国内开设天猫旗舰店、京东旗舰店等，线上模式没有了房屋租金，产品的价格也较以前有所降低。
Agent told reporters that now more and more overseas brands in China to open flagship stores, such as Tiantong flagship stores, the online model without rental housing, products prices have been lower than before.
海外品牌也在不断探索中国消费者的喜好，推出各类营销活动，留给代购的空间已经越来越小了。
Overseas brands are also exploring the preferences of Chinese consumers, launching a variety of marketing activities, leaving less and less room for agency.
“我们个体的力量是没办法跟品牌方竞争的，因此现在只能开发一些新产品，寻找一些没有在国内开设专柜或者网店的海外品牌。
"We can't compete with brands individually, so now we have to develop new products and look for overseas brands that don't have counters or online stores in the country.
”李丽告诉记者，现在也有一些代购平台或者公司向她抛出橄榄枝，她尚在考虑之中。
Li told reporters that there were other buying platforms or companies that offered to sell her olive branch, and she was still considering it.
但如果后续代购做起来更难的话，抱团取暖不失为一个好的选择。
But clustered heating is a good option if it is more difficult to do.
李鬼横行 真假难辨疫情之下，不出国门却售卖海外产品，暴露出了海外代购的乱象，但这仅仅是冰山一角。
The fact that Li Ge sells overseas products while staying out of the country exposes the confusion of buying overseas, but it is only the tip of the iceberg.
“随着《电商法》出台，对代购的管控再次收紧，提高了代购们的经营成本，同时也挤压了小微代购的生存空间，很多人就以代购之名，实则销售高仿、假货以及残次品等。
"With the introduction of the Electronic Commerce Act, regulation of contract buying has once again tightened, raising the operating costs of agents and squeezing the space for micro-purchase, with many selling imitation, fake and defective goods in the name of buying."
”从事多年代购工作的张先生说。
'says Mr. Zhang, who has been a multi-year buyer.
事实上，海外代购假货案件频发。
In fact, overseas purchase of counterfeit goods frequent cases.
日前，重庆市警方根据举报，一举查获了一个“海外代购”的电商平台。
Recently, Chongqing police according to the report, one seizure of an "overseas agent purchase" of the electric business platform.
在渝北区的仓库，现场查获假冒品牌箱包有2000多个，总涉案金额达5400万余元。
On-site detection of more than 2,000 fake brand bags in Yubei District warehouse involved a total of more than 54 million yuan.
广州天河警方也曾在广州白云区的某工业区内查获一个生产假冒日本品牌防晒霜的团伙。
Guangzhou Tianhe police have also seized an industrial zone in the Baiyun district of Guangzhou to produce fake Japanese brand sunscreen gangs.
据调查，这些假冒的防晒霜一瓶大约218元左右，而作案团队制作一瓶假冒防晒霜的成本最多也就十几元。
According to the investigation, the counterfeit sunscreen bottle about 218 yuan, and the perpetrators of a fake bottle of sunscreen production costs at most a dozen yuan.
如此暴利，让不少代购趋之若鹜。
Such a large profit, let a lot of agents to rush.
一位从事精仿海外大牌彩妆的人士透露，部分大牌精仿品会有防伪码，有部分代购会铤而走险，以仿品冒充正品进行销售，但这种行为风险很大，供应商不会承担任何责任。
A person engaged in fine overseas make-up revealed that some big brands of fine imitation products will have anti-counterfeiting code, some will take the risk of selling imitation as genuine products, but this behavior is so risky that suppliers will not bear any responsibility.
同时记者发现，与上述徐女士的邻居一样，没有出国购买产品，却有出国视频、机票甚至购买产品视频的现象时有发生。
At the same time, the reporter found that, like Ms. Xu's neighbors, did not go abroad to buy products, but there are video abroad, tickets and even the purchase of video products.
对此，从事海外产品批发的李某告诉记者，这种图是可以转发的，很多代购都是这样操作。
In this regard, engaged in overseas products wholesale Lee told reporters, this graph can be forwarded, many agents are doing so.
而且现在什么图都可以做出来，还有人职业给代购提供买货小视频，像在韩国新世界乐天门口，有很多韩国本地人做这行赚钱。
And now anything can be done, and there are people who offer buying videos to a surrogate, like the one that many locals do in South Korea's New World, Le Ting.
根据该人士透露，有些代购不敢卖国内工厂的假货，就会专门去卖国外的“假货”。
According to this source, some agents do not dare to sell domestic factory fakes, will be specialized in selling "fake goods" outside the country.
而这并不是真正的假货，产品也是由正规厂家生产，但由于质量参差不齐，供货对象也会有所差别。
And this is not really fake goods, products are also produced by the formal manufacturers, but because of the uneven quality, the target will also be different.
比如最高质量的就会拿去专柜上销售，而其他质量相对次一些的就可能卖给代购，也算正品，但是价格会优惠很多。
For example, the highest quality will be taken to the counter for sale, while other relatively inferior quality may be sold to agents, but the price will be much more favorable.
而代购拿这种产品回国卖，自然就会赚取更高的利润，又不用担心查出假货。
And buying and selling such products back home will naturally earn higher profits, without fear of detection of counterfeit goods.
此外，记者还注意到，无论是代购，还是一些海外批发商，其发货地址大多是深圳、上海等港口城市。
In addition, reporters also noted that whether buying agents, or some overseas wholesalers, their shipping addresses are mostly Shenzhen, Shanghai and other port cities.
对此，李某表示，这是为了节约成本，因为在港口城市设立仓库，可以将国外的产品统一发货，方便接收。
In response, Li said that this is to save costs, because in the port city set up warehouses, foreign products can be unified delivery, easy to receive.
但有代购告诉记者，这种仓库还有另一种“功能”。
But the agency told reporters that the warehouse also has another "function."
很多买家关注海外代购的物流单号，“异地上线”就能解决快递行程问题。
Many buyers pay attention to the overseas purchase of logistics single number, "off-line" can solve the problem of express itinerary.
所谓异地上线，就是指卖家将货物先从原地址寄到异地，再从这些地方寄到买家手中。
The so-called off-site line, that is, the seller from the original address to send goods to other places, and from these places to the buyer.
而不少所谓的“海外爆品”实为国内生产后“留洋回国”的假货。
And many so-called "overseas explosives" for domestic production after "stay home" fake goods.
有媒体曾报道，大连海关在一出境至日本的旅客行李中查获一批涉嫌侵权化妆品。
Media have reported that Dalian customs in an outbound passenger luggage to Japan seized a batch of suspected infringing cosmetics.
经过鉴定，已证实为侵权品。
After identification, has been confirmed as a tort.
该批化妆品仿真程度高，仅从外观难以辨识。
This batch of cosmetics simulation degree, only from the appearance is difficult to identify.
据推测，是准备带出境再以代购直邮方式流回国内。
Supposedly, it is prepared to take out the country and then send it back to China by direct mail.
营销专家杨青山表示，目前代购行业市场庞大，但是整体较为混乱，许多代购并无经营许可证，所以即使消费者买到假货，后续的维权也比较艰难。
Yang Qingshan, a marketing expert, said the buying industry is large, but the overall confusion, many of the subcontractors do not have operating licenses, so even if consumers buy fake goods, the follow-up rights are more difficult.
因此，目前主要还是靠消费者自身提高辨别真假的能力。
Therefore, at present, it is mainly consumers themselves to improve the ability to distinguish between true and false.
起底代购事业对于代购行业来说，受海外疫情冲击最明星的就是人肉代购。
From the bottom up buying business for the buying industry, the most affected by the overseas epidemic is the human flesh buying agent.
但目前代购方式，并不止人肉代购一种，而是更加多元化的存在。
But at present the buying method, not only the human flesh buying one, but more diversified existence.
随着市场需求的增加，代购也逐渐有了种类之分。
With the increase of market demand, agent buying has gradually been divided into categories.
从事海外代购的李铭（化名）告诉《中国经营报》记者，目前的代购分为3种，最普通的就是人肉代购。
Li Ming (not his real name), who works overseas, told China Business News that there are three types of buying agents, the most common being human flesh buying.
所谓的人肉代购就是指代购者自己预约特价机票飞往国外，一般去免税店购买产品，然后带回国内进行销售，主要销售渠道就是网店以及朋友圈等社交平台。
The so-called human flesh buying refers to the agent booking special tickets to fly abroad, usually to the duty-free shop to buy products, and then back home for sale, the main sales channels are online shops and friends, such as social platforms.
这种代购方式比较灵活，在购买过程中，消费者可以随时下单订货，当然提前几天甚至几个月预订都是可以的。
This buying method is more flexible, in the purchase process, consumers can order at any time, of course a few days or even months in advance can be ordered.
此外，所代购的产品除了保真，一般还包邮，而且价格比专柜稍微便宜一些，所以很多消费者都比较信任这样的代购。
In addition, the purchase of products in addition to fidelity, generally package mail, and prices are slightly cheaper than counters, so many consumers are more confident in such buying.
但李铭表示，由于海关管控比较严格，限制个人携带量，代购每次带回来的产品量比较小，这样一来，代购成本就会增高，利润自然就会下降。
But Mr Li said that because of tighter customs controls and restrictions on the amount of goods carried by individuals, the number of products brought back on behalf of each purchase was relatively small, so the buying costs would be higher and profits would naturally decline.
记者了解到，除了做常见的人肉代购，另外一种则是邮寄代购，就是海外产品直接邮寄回国，但因为这种代购需要的成本很高，并且一般只有本土产品可以邮寄，免税店里的奢侈品等产品是不可以邮寄的，所以目前做的人不是很多。
Reporters have learned that, in addition to the usual purchase of human flesh, the other is direct mail delivery of overseas products, but because of the high cost of such purchases and the fact that only local products are normally mailed, products such as luxury goods in duty-free shops are not allowed to be mailed, so not many people are currently doing so.
相比人肉代购和邮寄代购，为节约成本，很多代购都开始选择第三种代购方式，即在国内拿货。
In order to save costs, many buying agents are opting for a third method of buying goods at home, as opposed to buying on behalf of human flesh and mail.
上述姜女士告诉记者：“代购成本很高，除了出国的费用、需要花很久的时间之外，代购去正品店里购买产品，囤货就需要很大一笔资金。
"Apart from the cost of going abroad and the long time it takes, buying products in genuine stores requires a lot of money," Kang told reporters.
在这个层面上就限制了一部分人做代购。
At this level, some people are restricted from acting as agents.
但现在的代购为何还能随处可见，就是因为很多人的货并不是专门去国外购买回来的。
But why can you still see the purchase today, is because a lot of people's goods are not specially bought abroad.
”记者以代购身份从一家跨境贸易公司相关负责人处了解到，目前很多代购都会找他们批发海外产品。
Reporters acting as buying agents have learned from the head of a cross-border trading company that they are being sought for wholesale overseas products.
除此之外，公司还可以提供代发服务，为让顾客信服，该公司表示可以告知顾客产品是在海外专柜购买。
In addition, the company can offer contract services, and to convince customers, the company says it can inform customers that products are bought in overseas counters.
另一位做日本产品批发的李某表示，代购们已经成为自己的主流客户。
Li Mou, another wholesaler of Japanese products, says buying agents have become their mainstream customers.
因为现在代购跑去国外拿的都是零售价，而自己的产品是国外批发价，所以在价格方面，比代购自己去国外进货要便宜很多。
Because it is now the retail price of buying and selling goods abroad, and their own products are wholesale prices abroad, so in terms of prices, it is much cheaper than buying their own to buy goods abroad.
他还透露，一批货几天基本就会售罄。
He also revealed that a lot of goods will be sold out in a few days.
一般产品都是从深圳发货，但公司只出货，不提供任何票据。
General products are shipped from Shenzhen, but the company only shipped, do not provide any notes.
而对于货源，上述李某表示，公司有团队在国外刷货，但大多是和国外的贸易公司合作，这样相对来说价格会有优势。
For the supply, the above-mentioned Li said that the company has a team to brush goods abroad, but mostly with foreign trading companies, which will have a relative price advantage.
但至于具体的货源信息，并未过多透露。
However, as for the specific source information, not too much disclosure.
