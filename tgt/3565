英国将不再对仅有轻微症状的人进行检测，而是将检测重点放在重症患者身上。
Instead of testing people with mild symptoms, the UK will focus on people with severe illnesses.
而在确诊病例数不断增长的情况下，学校仍然不会关闭，大型活动也未被暂停。
In spite of the increasing number of confirmed cases, schools remain closed and major events are not suspended.
记　者 | 吴　雪受访人｜陈欣怡（化名）我叫陈欣怡，在英国华威商学院攻读商业分析专业研究生，这所学校位于伦敦西北部一个名叫考文垂（Coventry）的城市，这个城市不大，人口约35万人，地处英格兰的中心，距离伦敦最快仅有50分钟的火车车程。
My name is Michelle Chen, a graduate student in business analysis at Warwick Business School in north-west London, a small city with a population of about 350,000, situated in the heart of England and within 50 minutes of London's fastest train journey.
英国华威商学院校园教学楼　受访者供图3月13日，我上完第二学期最后一节课，收拾好书本，走出教室。
On March 13, I finished my last class of the second semester. I packed up my books and left the classroom.
三天前，我突然收到了学校群发的一封邮件。
Three days ago, I received an e-mail from the school.
华威商学院校方发布的邮件　受访者供图邮件中写道：“我们正在评估和试点一些线上直播课，这只是测试，以备在第三学期进行更广泛的调整，本周学校全面开放，教学活动照常进行。
"We are evaluating and piloting a number of live online classes, which are just tests for wider adjustments in the third semester," wrote one of the e-mail respondents at the Warwick Business School.
”直播课的通知，并不在我意料之外，就在前一天，英国牛津大学刚刚发布了一份声明：该校又有3名学生新冠病毒检测结果为阳性，累计确诊5例。
The announcement came as no surprise to me, just the day before Oxford had announced that three more students had tested positive for the virus, with a cumulative total of five confirmed cases.
学校没有停课，只能做好个人防护我来英国四年多了，今年1月26日，我从伦敦国王大学本科毕业，因为申请硕士offer时间太晚，研究生的宿舍未能申请到，我便和7位同学合租了一栋三层独栋公寓。
I graduated from King's University in London on January 26 because it was too late to apply for a master's degree. I shared a three-storey apartment with seven of my classmates.
我住在二层，有自己的卫浴，但厨房要和大家共享。
I live on the second floor and have my own bathroom, but the kitchen needs to be shared.
还好，室友们对新冠肺炎的重视程度一致，出门回来都会自觉洗手、喷洒酒精。
Fortunately, the roommates to the new crown pneumonia attention degree is the same, will go out to wash hands consciously, spray alcohol.
陈欣怡所在的公寓相比之下，我所在的公寓，还算不上严格。
Chen Xinyi's apartment, in contrast, my apartment, is not so strict.
我一个华人朋友说，他们宿舍近期已经把大家召集起来，开了一个小会，建立了聊天群组，并要求所有室友一旦外出必须在群内报备，随时让大家知晓每个人的行动轨迹和动向。
One of my Chinese friends said that his dorm had recently brought everyone together, held a small meeting, set up a chat group, and asked all roommates to report to the group once they went out.
公寓距离学校走路15分钟，上学路上我不会戴口罩，保持与他人的距离。
The apartment is 15 minutes away from the school, and I don't wear a mask on my way to school.
但在四五十个人的大课堂，我就会很自觉地戴上，目前教室戴口罩的人数占到70%左右，比例不低，但大部分是华人面孔。
But in the 40-or-50-person college class, I will wear them consciously. Classroom wearing masks now account for about 70% of the population, a high percentage, but mostly Chinese.
即便戴了口罩，也保不齐会有些风险因素。
Even if you wear a mask, there are some risk factors.
上上周三，班级有一个小组讨论，我们小组有一个西班牙人，刚去西班牙参加了面试，当时西班牙累计确诊病例已有2128例，但这位同学并没有采取任何防护措施，也没有主动提出自行隔离。
Last Wednesday, there was a panel discussion in our class. We had a Spaniard who had just gone to Spain for an interview. There were 2,128 confirmed cases in Spain at the time, but the student did not take any protective measures and did not offer to isolate himself.
刚下飞机，就直奔教室，我是很担心的，但人家既然来了，周四又着急交作业，我怕说了显得我“矫情”，只好下意识地确认下自己的口罩有没有戴好。
As soon as I got off the plane, I went straight to the classroom. I was worried, but since they were here and worried about handing in my homework on Thursday, I was afraid of appearing "affectionate" and had to subconsciously make sure my mask was on.
华威商学院教室照片　受访者供图一直以来，英国政府都在鼓励民众多洗手，而不是戴口罩，包括已经确诊的纳丁·多里斯女士也在告诉民众要切记洗手、洗手再洗手。
2007-9-25 21: 38 [hide] Britain's government has been encouraging people to wash their hands more often than they do, including Ms. Nadine Doris, who has been diagnosed, and told people to wash their hands, hands and hands.
学校也张贴了详细具体的洗手步骤，因为国内情况知道的比较多，洗手、戴口罩、喷洒酒精，我是一样都不落的。
Detailed and specific hand-washing steps have also been posted in schools because I know more about the country and wash my hands, wear masks and spray alcohol.
华威商学院教学楼　受访者供图学校洗手间张贴的洗手步骤　受访者供图英国限制民众买口罩英国首例确诊病例时间是在1月31日，那时大家不以为意。
2007-9-25 21: 23 (Warwick Business School Building Respondents to Wash Hands in Toilet Toilet) British restrictions on buying masks The first confirmed case in the UK came on January 31 and people were not impressed.
其实，我的防范意识也不强，我简单地认为只要不去聚众的地方，应该无碍。
In fact, my sense of prevention is not strong, I simply do not think that as long as the gathering place, should be no hindrance.
2月16日，闺蜜过生日，我专门乘坐小火车到达伦敦，为她庆生。
On February 16, my girlfriend's birthday, I arrived in London on a special train to celebrate her birthday.
当时的英国人还是比较淡定的。
At that time, the English people are still relatively calm.
伦敦地铁、双层巴士能看到有人戴口罩，但大部分是亚洲面孔，公共场所也没有像国内一样很严格的测体温。
London Underground, double-decker buses can see people wearing masks, but most of them are Asian faces, public places are not as strict as the domestic temperature measurement.
伦敦标志性建筑“伦敦眼”附近的人流密集，大家都像往常一样拍照、游览，一切如常。
London's iconic building, the Eye of London, is crowded with people taking photos and sightseeing as usual.
2月16日去伦敦为闺蜜庆生　受访者供图到了3月9日，英国王室还在威斯敏斯特大教堂举行了英联邦日活动，活动定于每年3月的第二个星期一，女王伊丽莎白二世和王室成员都参加了。
Queen Elizabeth II and members of the royal family attend a Commonwealth Day party at Westminster Abbey on February 16, 2002, the second Monday in March.
当然不可能戴口罩。
Of course you can't wear a mask.
但在伦敦的华人警惕程度则很高，早在一月份，国内疫情刚刚暴发时，我们去Leicester Square（莱斯特广场）海底捞旗舰店吃火锅，扯拉面的小伙子就已经戴起了一次性外科手术口罩了。
But the level of vigilance among Chinese in London is high. As early as January, just after the outbreak of the disease in China, we went to Leicester Square to grab a hot pot at the flagship store, and the young man pulling the noodles had already put on a disposable surgical mask.
Play海底捞服务生戴上口罩扯面　受访者提供但后来，３月初，我开始觉得不对劲了，我看到官方发布的确诊人数曲线图，暴涨正是在最近一周时间，一下子增长了300多例，而确诊病例大部分是从意大利等其他欧洲国家返回英国的，太多人去意大利滑雪场滑雪了。
But then, in early March, I began to see something wrong. It was in the last week that I saw the official chart of confirmed cases soar by more than 300 cases, mostly from Italy and other European countries. Too many people went skiing in Italian ski resorts.
英国新冠肺炎确诊病例增长曲线图我还看到一条新闻，3月11日，英国政府对两个打广告的口罩公司进行了罚款，下架了所有的口罩广告，原因是要限制民众购买口罩，称要将口罩留给医护人员。
| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
但实际情况很可能是市面上根本就买不到口罩了。
But the fact is that there is probably no face mask available.
这点，我购买口罩的经历，能说明些问题。
At this point, my experience buying masks speaks for itself.
2月底，伦敦中国城商店的口罩大多数非常紧俏甚至脱销，我好不容易找到一家药店，门口贴了告示：“new arrival新到口罩。
At the end of February, most of the masks in the China City store in London were very tight and even out of stock.
”一问价格，最薄的一次性口罩，一个5英镑（约合人民币43元），N95价格就更离谱了，15英镑（约合人民币129元）一个。
When it comes to price, the thinner disposable mask costs five pounds (43 yuan), and the N95 is an even more outrageous price, 15 pounds (129 yuan).
因为急用，我还是买了几个。
I bought a few because I was in a hurry.
考文垂公寓、学校周边的药妆店、24小时便利店的口罩货架，均抢购一空，补货时间不定。
Coventry apartments, dresser shops around the school, 24-hour convenience store masks shelves were all snapped up, with irregular replenishment times.
包括消毒液、酒精的货架很多地方都卖空了，只有TESCO超市暂时有少量供货，要求每人限购几瓶，但3月14日，我听朋友说，消毒液和洗手液也已经全部断货了。
The shelves, which included disinfectant and alcohol, were empty in many places. Only TESCO supermarket had a few temporary supplies and asked everyone to limit their purchases, but on March 14, I heard from friends that the disinfectant and hand sanitizers had all been out of stock.
便利店、超市的洗手液和方便食品均处于缺货状态看到“群体免疫”，我更慌了老实说，我对英国的检测和防疫措施，表示很担心。
Convenience stores, supermarket hand sanitizers and ready-to-use foods are out of stock. Seeing "mass immunization," I'm even more alarmed.
华威商学院也开通了一个热线，专门接收发热信息。
Warwick Business School has also set up a hotline to receive heat messages.
但实际上，英国目前的医疗采取免费医疗，就算平时的NHS都要至少排上4个小时的队。
But in practice, health care in Britain is now free, with the NHS queuing up for at least four hours at least.
对于新冠病毒的检测和治疗能力也非常弱，我看新闻报道说，英国全国ECMO只有不到20台。
The detection and treatment capacity for the new crown virus is also very weak, and I see news reports that there are fewer than 20 ECMO nationwide.
英国新冠肺炎检测指示牌我看到英国政府发布的“群体免疫”政策之后，更加担忧了。
Britain's New Crown Pneumonia Test Signs I'm even more worried when I see the UK government's "mass immunization" policy.
而在确诊病例数不断增长的情况下，学校仍然不会关闭，大型活动也未被暂停。
In spite of the increasing number of confirmed cases, schools remain closed and major events are not suspended.
我不知道第三学期的课程什么时候开始，但我妈妈在微信群里发来消息：给你寄的口罩包裹，显示已经发出了。
I don't know when the third semester of classes will begin, but my mother sent me a message from the microphone group: The mask she sent you was wrapped to show that it had been delivered.
接下来，我会取消旅游计划，拒绝参加一切聚会，囤些快餐、零食及防疫物品，以备不时之需。
Next, I would cancel my travel plans, refuse to attend all parties, and stock up on fast food, snacks and epidemic prevention items in case of emergency.
