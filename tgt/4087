疫情之下，除了工作强度增加，不少医护人员的工资收入、绩效奖金等也受到影响，还有人表示疫情打乱了自己找工作的计划。
In addition to the increased intensity of work under the epidemic, many health-care workers' wages, performance bonuses, and others said the outbreak disrupted their own job-hunting plans.
网上「最难就业季」的消息频出，焦虑的应届毕业生和忙碌的一线医务人员在面对 2020 年的医疗圈春招时，又会有哪些不同的感受？丁香园联合丁香人才开展 2020 医疗春招调研，为大家带来真实的医疗圈求职现状。
With news of the "toughest season" coming online, what will the anxious fresh graduates and busy front-line medical staff feel when they face the medical circus of 2020?

国民经济受冲击超 8 成医务人员疫情期间收入下降3 月 16 日，国家统计局发布今年前两个月国民经济运行主要指标数据。
The National Statistics Bureau released data on major indicators of the country's economic operation in the first two months of this year.
受新冠肺炎疫情影响，前两个月我国经济运行主要指标增速有所回落。
Affected by the outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia, the first two months of China's economic performance indicators have slowed down.
由于营收受到影响，大量企业也不得不开始降薪裁员。
Because of the impact on revenue, a large number of enterprises have had to start wage cuts.
有调查统计数据显示，与 2019 年相比，今年春招季企业对毕业生的需求下降了一半（49.38%）。
Statistics show that demand for graduates has halved this spring (49.38%) compared with 2019.
医疗行业同样受到影响。
The health sector has also been affected.
虽然有国家补助支持，但符合补助标准且已经领到补助的医务人员还是少数，丁香人才往期调查显示，截至 3 月 10 日，全国超八成医务人员仍未收到补助。
Although supported by state subsidies, the number of medical personnel eligible for the subsidy and who have received subsidies is still small. The previous survey of clove talent shows that as of March 10, more than 80% of medical personnel nationwide had not received subsidies.
本次丁香人才调查报告显示，共 742 位医务人员参与调查，其中一半以上的人（56.3%）表示人绩效、奖金受到影响，基本工资没有影响。
More than half (56.3 percent) of the 742 medical staff questioned in the clove survey said performance, bonuses and basic pay were affected.
29.4% 人基本工资、绩效、奖金均受到影响，只有少数人（7.6%）的收入未受影响。
Basic wages, performance and bonuses affected 29.4 per cent of the population, while only a few (7.6 per cent) were not affected.

在新冠肺炎疫情的推动下，省市级的三甲医院或将迎来一轮建设潮。
In the new crown pneumonia epidemic, the provincial and municipal hospitals may usher in a wave of construction.
据了解，北、上、深、广、杭以及天津、厦门等地均在计划扩建大型三甲医院。
It is understood that the north, upper, deep, Guangzhou, Hangzhou and Tianjin, Xiamen and other places are planning to expand the large triple A hospital.
而医院的扩建和新建，也意味着人才需求的增长。
And the expansion of hospitals and new construction, also means the demand for talent growth.
（文末可查看全国扩建医院汇总）据丁香人才后台发布有效职位统计，今年春招招聘岗位数不降反升，同比 2019 年 1～3 月有效岗位数增长 6.4%。
According to the statistics released by the backstage of lilac talents, the number of posts recruited this spring has not decreased, and the number of posts effectively increased by 6.4% from January to March 2019.
而根据丁香人才平台上 1～3 月有效发布科室岗位增幅显示，公共卫生、医院管理、全科、感染传染科、体检科、精神心理科、肿瘤科、针灸推拿、药剂科、急诊科成为今年春招需求大增的前 10 个科室。
According to the increase of the number of posts in departments and offices in 1 ~ 3 months, the departments of public health, hospital management, general practice, infectious diseases, physical examination, psychopsychology, oncology, acupuncture and massage, pharmacy and emergency departments have become the top 10 departments of this year's demand.
同时，国家鼓励加大线上招聘力度，大力推广视频招聘、远程面试，并且支持简化招聘程序和设立招聘绿色通道，这也使得很多医院开启了线上投递和视频面试，为求职者提供了更便捷的途径，供需对接更流畅。
At the same time, the State encourages more on-line recruitment, vigorously promotes video recruitment, distance interviews and supports the simplification of recruitment procedures and the establishment of green channels for recruitment, which has also enabled many hospitals to open online delivery and video interviews, providing easier access to job seekers and better matching between supply and demand.
疫情或多或少地阻碍了招聘流程，但并不妨碍大量人才需求的涌动迸发。
The epidemic has more or less blocked the recruitment process, but it has not prevented a surge in the demand for talent.
本次调查结果显示，53% 的医务人员表示目前尚未遇到医院招聘变化，22.5% 的人所在单位已经暂时取消招聘计划。
According to the survey, 53 per cent of medical staff said they had not experienced any change in hospital recruitment and 22.5 per cent had suspended recruitment plans.
不过我们可以推测，在疫情缓解后，随着医院逐渐开始恢复招聘进程，多数在职医务人员得空加入跳槽队伍，4 月或迎来求职最高峰。
We can speculate, however, that as the epidemic subsided and hospitals gradually resumed the recruitment process, most in-service medical staff would have to join the ranks of job-hoppers in April or at the height of the job search.
这 8 岗位科室竞争最激烈平均 100 个人竞争 1 个岗位今年应届生因为疫情开学延迟或者规培和实习延迟，只能待业在家，因而有更多的时间寻找工作机会。
This year's freshmen, delayed by the start of the school year or delayed by regulations and internships, will have to stay at home and have more time to find work.
据丁香人才后台投递数据显示，今年春招较去年应届生投递人数同比增长 76.9%。
According to lilac talent back-office data, this spring recruitment compared with last year's student delivery of 76.9% year-on-year.
与应届生投递数量增加相反，在职医务人员由于忙碌在一线岗位或者心仪单位招聘信息未出而在 3 月选择沉寂，投递人数增幅不明显（仅 11%）。
In contrast to the increase in the number of new students, the number of serving medical staff in March due to busy in the front-line posts or the preferred unit recruitment information, quiet, the increase in the number of delivery (only 11%) was not significant.
本次调查显示，14.6% 的求职者遇到招聘单位只接受线上投递，还有 9.3% 的人遇到了视频面试。
The survey showed that 14.6 percent of job seekers encountered an online delivery system and 9.3 percent had a video interview.
丁香人才 2 月初面向用人单位的调查结果也印证了这一点，绝大多数医院（80%）今年春招采用了「线上+线下」的招聘方式，线上、线下的比重相等，只有 13% 和 6% 的医院完全采用线下面试、线上面试的方式。
Most hospitals (80%) used the 'online + offline' recruitment method this spring, with only 13% and 6% of hospitals using off-line and online interviews.
在投递竞争方面，今年春招全科、康复医学、检验科、普内科、公卫、整形外科、骨科和影像放射科的科室竞争较激烈，平均 100 岗位人竞争 1 个岗位。
In terms of competition, this spring the departments of general practice, rehabilitation medicine, examination, general medicine, public health, orthopaedics, orthopaedics and radiology competed fiercely, with an average of 100 people competing for one post.
佛系求职者退而求其次普遍降低薪酬预期基于今年的春招大趋势，调查结果显示 52.4% 的医护都选择「稳定为先」，继续在原岗位工作，38.6% 的医护认为「今年合适的工作机会更难找了」。
The survey found that 52.4 percent of the healthcare professionals chose "stability first" to continue working in their previous jobs, while 38.6 percent thought "suitable job opportunities will be harder to find this year."
此外，还有很多人打算放弃春招，备战秋招。
In addition, many people are ready to give up Spring Festival moves to prepare for the autumn.
调查显示，31.7% 的人打算在 3～5 月份找工作，还有 15% 的人打算在 6～9 月份再找工作。
The survey shows 31.7 percent plan to look for a job in March or May and 15 percent plan to do so in June or September.
受到疫情影响，求职者对于涨薪的期待值也有所降低。
Job seekers' expectations of wage increases have also fallen as a result of the epidemic.
在去年的「2019 年度丁香人才求职调研」，大多数人希望可以获得 30～50% 的涨幅。
In last year's 2019 survey of job searches for clove talent, most people expected a 30 to 50 per cent increase.
而今年他们对于薪资的涨幅降低到了 20～30% 。
This year their pay rises have fallen to 20 to 30 percent.
>>点此查询你的薪资水平在跳槽时的关注因素上来看，与去年相同，薪酬待遇、晋升空间一直是跳槽时求职者最关注的两大因素，88.6% 的医务人员表示跳槽时最关注薪酬待遇，52.7% 表示最关注晋升空间。
As with last year, compensation and promotion space were the top two concerns for job-hoppers, with 88.6% saying they valued salary when changing jobs and 52.7% saying they were most concerned about promotion space.
值得注意的是，此前曾经很受重视的「编制」因素并没有进入医务人员求职主要考虑范围，这也许和去编制化进程推进、医务人员对编制的利弊权衡有关。
It is worth noting that the "establishment" factor, which had previously been valued, was not a major consideration for medical personnel seeking employment, perhaps in relation to the advancement of the decodification process and the trade-offs in staffing by medical staff.
