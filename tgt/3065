若干年后回望，这一定是一段值得铭记的日子。
Looking back over the years, it must be a day worth remembering.
因为新冠肺炎疫情，许多家庭无法团圆。
Many families are unable to reunite because of the new crown pneumonia outbreak.
疫情数据地图的每次刷新都令人揪心。
Each update of the epidemic data map is heartbreaking.
我们和千万武汉人在一起，这不只是一句安慰，因为没有人能够置身事外。
We are with tens of millions of Wuhan people, which is not only a comfort, because no one can stay out of the way.

作者 | 卫楠2020年1月17日，腊月廿三，我要带两个孩子去武汉，找爸爸。
At the end of January 17, 2020, I will take my two children to Wuhan to find my father.
匆忙收拾完他们的东西，我们赶到机场。
Rushing up their things, we arrived at the airport.
太原已经有了春运的感觉，我怀里抱着小的，手里领着大的，心里盘算，奶粉够吃5天，纸尿裤、奶瓶、大宝的作业……生怕落了点什么。
Taiyuan has had the feeling of spring transportation, I embrace small arms, leading a large hand, calculation, milk powder enough to eat 5 days, paper diapers, bottles, Bao's homework...
起飞了，不到1岁的小宝不怕，大宝有些怕，我心里也是忐忑的，这是我们三个第一次一起坐飞机。
Take-off, less than a year old Xiaobao is not afraid, Dabao some fear, my heart is perturbed, this is the first time we fly together.
他们的爸爸在武汉“修地铁”，事实上，我们俩都是“工程人”。
Their father in Wuhan "repair the subway", in fact, we are both "engineers."
我想起出发前老公的叮嘱：一定要给孩子戴好口罩，最近咳嗽的人比较多。
I remember my husband's advice before leaving: Be sure to wear a mask for your child. More people have coughed recently.
可小宝太小，戴不了。
But Xiao Bao is too young to wear.
我扫视了一下机舱内，也没几个戴口罩的，逐渐安心了，暗自埋怨他大惊小怪。
I scanned the cabin, few of whom were wearing masks, and began to feel relieved, complaining to myself about his fuss.
到达武汉已是晚上，有点冷。
Arriving in Wuhan at night is a bit cold.
怀中的小宝早已熟睡，大宝却异常兴奋：“妈妈快看，武汉欢迎您，你看那小神龙！”车穿过大桥，我看着平静的水面倒映灯光，想起太原的汾河早已冰封，默默计划着，这一周要带孩子看长江大桥，看武汉大学，看不到樱花，也至少要沾点文化气息。
You are welcome to Wuhan, you see the Dragon! "The car across the bridge, I looked at the calm water reflected the light, I recall Taiyuan Fenhe long frozen, silently planning, this week to take children to see the Yangtze Bridge, see Wuhan University, can not see cherry, at least a bit of cultural atmosphere.
1月21日，离年关越来越近，老公依然很忙。
January 21, closer and closer to the end of the year, my husband is still very busy.
没有老人帮忙，我第一次自己带两个孩子。
For the first time I had two children of my own without the help of an old man.
老公的宿舍没有电视，手机是大宝英语辅导班打卡的工具，楼道里充满84消毒液的味道。
Husband's dormitory does not have TV, the mobile phone is the tool that the Dabao English remedial class hits the card, the hallway is full of 84 disinfectant smell.
直到下午，我突然意识到，很久没有听到龙门吊嘀嘀的警报声了，也没有出渣车的声音……盾构机出问题了？作为工程人，我多少知道，盾构机停工1天损失有多大，更何况是停在武汉地铁工期那么紧张的时候。
Until this afternoon, I suddenly realized that for a long time there was no sound of sirens and no scum cars... Shield machine problem? As an engineer, I know how much damage shield machine lost in a day, not to mention in Wuhan metro construction time so tense.
一定是发生了什么。
Something must have happened.
算了算，我已经3天没有看见老公了。
Come on, I haven't seen my husband in three days.
打电话，他只说忙。
Call. He's just busy.
1月22日，好几天没回家的他，晚上10点突然到家了。
January 22, several days did not go home, he suddenly arrived home at 10 p.m.
孩子们早就睡了，他站在门外，脱掉工装，让我拿个箱子放衣服、安全帽。
The children had gone to bed. He stood outside the door, took off his overalls and asked me to take a suitcase to put on my clothes and helmet.
这一系列“神操作”，让我觉得不可理解。
This series of "divine manipulation" makes me feel incomprehensible.
此时，远在山西的母亲打电话，告诉我最近武汉流行一种肺炎，一定不要出门。
At this time, remote in Shanxi mother called to tell me that Wuhan recently popular a pneumonia, must not go out.
我赶紧用手机上网，看到钟南山院士确认新冠病毒“人传人”的消息已经到处都是。
I hastened to use the mobile phone to access the Internet, see Academician Zhong Nan Shan confirmed that the new crown virus "person-to-person" has been everywhere.
以至于我听到相关报道的配乐都觉得心惊肉跳。
So much so that I was stunned to hear the soundtrack of the story.
老公不停地打电话，一直在问，“有没有口罩，有没有消毒水”。
Husband calls ceaselessly, ask continuously, "Have no mask, have disinfectant water".
“这个冬天这里有流行疾病。
"There are epidemic diseases here this winter.
”我想，“但应该跟流感差不多，可能稍微重点吧？”我还没有意识到，此时地铁施工现场以外的武汉城，一个魔盒正在打开。
"But it should be about the same as the flu, maybe a little bit important," I thought, not realizing that a magic box was opening in Wuhan, just outside the subway construction site.
1月23日，腊月廿九。
January 23rd, Lunar New Year.
新闻里说，武汉开始封城，社区也在行动，我才觉得恐慌，打电话让老公去抢购物资。
Wuhan began to close the city, the community is also in action, I feel panic, call my husband to rush to buy supplies.
说实话，我根本不知道应该买什么，口罩、消毒水肯定是不奢望了，囤点方便面、火腿肠也好。
To tell the truth, I do not know what to buy, masks, disinfectant is certainly not extravagant, hoarding instant noodles, sausage or.
“你不是总说自己很能行吗，现在想办法，咱们逃离武汉吧！咱们回太原、回老家。
"You always say you can do it? Now do something about it. Let's run away from Wuhan! Let's go back to Taiyuan and back home.
”我对老公说。
'I said to my husband.
他告诉我，别慌张，别说没办法出去，就是有办法也不出去。
He told me not to panic, not to mention not to go out, but there is no way out.
施工现场本就是个相对封闭的环境，食堂一直有物资储备，可以保证大家的生活。
Construction site is a relatively closed environment, canteen has always had material reserves, can guarantee everyone's life.
公司早就从深圳、太原、西安等地采购了一批口罩、体温计等防疫用品，保证武汉这边的用量。
From Shenzhen, Taiyuan, Xi'an, and other places to purchase a number of masks, thermometers and other epidemic prevention supplies, to ensure the amount of Wuhan.
钟南山院士也来武汉了，全国那么多优秀的医生都来武汉了，我们为什么要逃离？逃出去有风险，坑了家人或者无辜的人怎么办？其实道理我也懂，只是身临险境时，我心中不免慌乱。
Zhong Nan Shan academician has also come to Wuhan, so many excellent doctors come to Wuhan, why do we have to flee? Run out of danger, the family or innocent people do?
看着睡梦中的两个孩子，我祈求上天，我从没做过坏事，不要让我的家人被感染啊，我的孩子还小，小宝才刚刚来到这个世上，请不要让她感受到悲伤。
Looking at the two children in my sleep, I pray to God, I have never done bad things, do not let my family infected ah, my children are young, Xiaobao has just come into the world, please do not let her feel sad.
那一夜，我睡不着。
I couldn't sleep that night.
1月24日，除夕。
New Year's Eve, 24 January.
食堂准备了年夜饭，鸡腿、炸小鱼、牛肉、西兰花……全部装在饭盒里，一份份送到宿舍门口。
Canteen prepared dinner, chicken legs, fried fish, beef, broccoli... all packed in a lunch box, a portion of the door to the dormitory.
这是小宝的第一个春节，我还切了根香肠，凉拌了皮蛋，凑够6个菜，过年还是要仪式感的。
This is Xiao Bao's first Spring Festival, I also cut a sausage, cold mix of skin eggs, make up enough for six dishes, New Year or ceremony or sense.
老公没事的时候总喜欢喝点小酒，但这个除夕他一口酒都没喝。
My husband always likes to drink a little wine when he is free, but he hasn't had a drink on New Year's Eve.
他说，现在是防疫的关键时期，项目上连着家属、劳务工170多人，盾构机也在洞里“停机保压”，绝对不能掉以轻心。
He said that now is the critical period of epidemic prevention, the project linked to family members, laborers more than 170, shield machine in the hole "shut down", absolutely can not take lightly.
吃了年夜饭，他开始发视频，一个一个宿舍拜年，叮嘱大家有干咳、发热症状一定要上报，生活上有什么需求也一定要说。
After Chinese New Year's Eve dinner, he began to send video, a dormitory to pay a New Year call, people have dry cough, fever symptoms must be reported, what needs in life must be said.
发完视频，他穿好工装、戴好安全帽去洞里进行巡查。
After the video, he put on his overalls, put on his helmet to inspect the hole.
我站在宿舍的窗户旁，能看着他走进施工现场的大门。
I stood by the dorm window and could watch him walk into the main gate of the construction site.
我担心着，他过马路的时候有人和他擦肩而过，会不会把病毒传染给他？工地上会不会有人在感染潜伏期内？太原的同事发来信息，我心烦，回了一个哭脸。
I was worried that someone might pass the virus to him when he crossed the street. Would someone be on the construction site during the incubation period? A message from my colleague from Taiyuan upset me and answered a cry.
她说：“你真的去了武汉？”“是，我真的在武汉，一个表情你都能猜出来。
She said: "You really went to Wuhan?" "Yes, I really in Wuhan, you can guess a facial expression.
”她说，你一直就是个开心人儿，什么时候发过这样的表情啊。
'she said.' You've always been a happy man.
翻看手机，除了亲友的安慰，只有新冠肺炎疫情的信息。
Looking at the mobile phone, in addition to the comfort of friends and relatives, only the new crown pneumonia epidemic information.
“妈妈，快看解放军，快看他们要来武汉了。
"Mom, look at the People's Liberation Army. Look, they're coming to Wuhan.
”大宝说。
"said Dabao.
我看向电脑屏幕，瞬间热泪盈眶。
I looked at the computer screen and tears welled up in my eyes.
这是有小宝后我第一次眼中有泪水，我看见战士们登上飞机，冰冷的空气好像忽然有了暖意。
It was the first time I had ever seen a tear in my eyes. I saw the soldiers boarding the plane. The cold air seemed to warm suddenly.
我想，大概只有此刻身处武汉的人才能真正体会，什么是绝望，什么是希望。
I think that only at this moment in Wuhan can really understand what is despair, what is hope.
2月14日是情人节。
February 14 is Valentine's Day.
15年了，这是我和老公在一起后，一起过的第一个情人节。
For 15 years, this is my first Valentine's Day together with my husband.
没有玫瑰花，他陪着大宝上英语课、打卡，还是那口蹩脚的“山英”。
There are no roses, he accompanied Dabao to English classes, cards, or the poor mouth of the "mountain Ying."
我逗着小宝玩，5平方米的宿舍有了家的味道。
I teased Xiao Bao to play, the 5-square-meter dormitory has the taste of home.
病毒还在肆虐，我们无法出门，可是已经学会享受这“不一样”的假期。
The virus is still raging, we can not go out, but we have learned to enjoy this "different" holiday.
中午，他拿出酒杯，对着电脑屏幕和工地的兄弟们一起举杯，虽然他们就在隔壁。
At noon, he took out his glass and raised it to the computer screen and his brothers at the construction site, even though they were next door.
大宝在我身边，画着医生打败病毒的图画，小宝瞪大双眼看着哥哥。
Dabao was beside me, drawing pictures of the doctor defeating the virus. Xiao Bao stared at his brother with wide eyes.
窗外葱绿，武大的樱花快开了吧，家乡的迎春花是不是已经开了。
Outside the window lush green, Wu Da cherry blossoms soon open bar, the hometown jasmine has not opened.
作为一名普通的基建人，我和老公常年在外施工。
As an ordinary infrastructure builder, my husband and I work outside all year round.
城市里的地铁线路是我们在地球上的足迹，也是我们青春的见证。
The subway lines in the city are our footprints on the earth and the witness of our youth.
2019年，我和他第一次来武汉，就在武汉大学旁边，我们约定好，等到隧道贯通时，一起去看樱花。
In 2019, he and I first came to Wuhan, next to Wuhan University, we agreed to wait until the tunnel through, together to see cherry blossoms.
长期以来，我们总觉得自己在给城市留下印记，但这一次，武汉给了我们一场不平凡的记忆。
For a long time, we always feel that we are leaving a mark on the city, but this time, Wuhan gave us an extraordinary memory.
我感叹，时间你走得快点吧，疫情赶紧过去。
I sigh, time you walk quickly, the epidemic situation hurriedly past.
我可以不看樱花，不去长江大桥，但让我门前的马路恢复车水马龙吧。
I can not see cherry blossoms, not Changjiang Bridge, but let the road in front of me restore traffic.
让人们摘掉口罩，让“大白”们回家，让我们都可以拥抱每一个想拥抱的人。
Let people take off their masks, let the "big white" people go home, so that we can all embrace everyone who wants to embrace.
下一个天亮，愿施工现场机器轰鸣，出渣车进进出出，我们戴着安全帽穿梭在工地上，管片起吊，一切正常，我们开工了。
The next morning, I hope the construction site machine roar, slag car in and out, we wear helmets shuttle construction site, tube lifting, everything is normal, we started.
