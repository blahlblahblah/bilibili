本报记者 许礼清 李向磊 北京报道自2月20日“问题口罩”事件被曝光至今，已过去了7天的时间。
Seven days have passed since our reporter Xu Liqing Li Xianlei reported in Beijing about the "problem mask" incident since February 20.
北京物美商业集团有限公司（以下简称“物美”）并未就此事作出公开说明或道歉。
Beijing Wumei Commercial Group Co. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Wumei") did not make a public statement or apology on this matter.
截至2月26日，不少在物美多点购买SAS N95 8617 Mask口罩、Scotts Maksks ASTM口罩以及Prestige Ameritech Face Masks医用口罩的消费者仍未收到相应的赔偿。
As of February 26, many consumers of SAS N95 8617 Mask Mask, Scotts Maksks ASTM Mask and Prestige Americas Face Masks have not yet been compensated.
日前，多位在物美抢购口罩的消费者表示自己收到的口罩存在过期、无生产日期等问题。
A few days ago, many in the United States Buying Mask consumers said that they received a mask expiration date, no production date, and other issues.
据《中国经营报》记者调查了解，自23日起，部分消费者已经收到了“退一赔三”赔偿。
According to the China Business Daily reporter survey, since 23, some consumers have received "one restitution three" compensation.
不过，《中国经营报》记者从消费者自发组织的维权群获得的数据显示，截至2月26日下午5点，仅在维权群内，仍有过半消费者尚未收到来自物美门店的赔偿。
However, as of 5 p.m. on February 26, more than half of consumers in the advocacy group alone had not yet received compensation from the store, according to data obtained by China Business News from advocacy groups organized by consumers on their own initiative.
其中，部分消费者处于正在与门店或客服沟通的阶段，也有消费者反映至今未有物美门店联系自己。
Among them, some consumers are in the store or customer service communication stage, but also consumers reported that there is no good store contact with themselves.
据不完全统计，目前上述3种口罩已经回收超1300个，但仍有超2800个、总价近25000元的口罩尚未完成回收。
According to incomplete statistics, more than 1,300 masks have been recovered so far, but more than 2,800, with a total price of nearly $25,000, have not yet been recovered.
但在维权群之外，是否仍有消费者未获赔偿，尚不得而知，物美亦未公布官方数据。
But outside the advocacy groups, it is not known whether there are consumers who have not been compensated, nor have the official figures been published.
中友律师事务所王东跃表示，销售无生产日期、过期口罩，属于欺诈行为，依据《消费者权益保护法》第五十五条规定，物美应该退一赔三。
Wang Dongyue, a Chinese law firm, said the sale of expired masks without production dates was a fraud and that beauty should be returned to the third party in accordance with Article 55 of the Consumer Rights and Interests Protection Law.
“目前有大量的不合格口罩在使用中，消费者戴着不合格的口罩出入公共场所，是极大的安全隐患，物美应该站出来公开说明和召回。
"There are a large number of unqualified masks in use, consumers wearing unqualified masks in public places, is a great safety risk, beauty should stand out and recall.
”《中国经营报》记者就涉事口罩整体规模、召回情况、赔付方案、是否会应消费者要求公开道歉等问题向物美发送采访函，但截至发稿，未收到回复。
The China Business Daily sent an interview letter to Wu Mei about the overall size of the mask involved, recall, payment plan and whether it would make a public apology at the request of consumers, but as of the date of dispatch, no response had been received.
多渠道索赔截至《中国经营报》记者发稿，据消费者自发组织的维权群不完全统计数据，仅在百人维权群内，物美旗下木樨园店、玉林里店、太阳岛店、万寿路店、玉泉路店、安外店、德胜门店、增光路店、潘家园店、玉蜓桥店、光明楼店、杜家坎店、天通苑店13家店已经对部分购买物美SAS N95 8617 Mask口罩的消费者按照退一赔三的方式进行了赔付；西门店、安外店、德胜门店、惠新店、玉蜓桥店对购买Scotts Maksks ASTM口罩的消费者进行了退一赔三的赔付；泰和园店、安外店、德胜门店、惠新店、玉蜓桥店、宋庄店、甘露园店对销售Prestige Ameritech Face Masks医用口罩同样进行了退一赔三的赔付。
According to incomplete statistics of advocacy groups organized by consumers, 13 stores in Wumei's Muxicyuan shop, Yulinlidian Shop, Sun Island Shop, Wanshu Shop, Yuquan Road Shop, Anhui Shop, Desheng Men Shop, Zhangguang Road Shop, Pan Jiayuan Shop, Yushen Mask Shop, Panjiayuan Shop, Jade Bridge Shop, Du Jiakandian and Tian Tong Yuan Shop have paid a one-to-three refund to consumers who buy Spot N95 8617 Mask Mask.
据不完全统计，目前已经回收的上述3种类型的口罩超过1300个，关于涉及的门店和相关数据，《中国经营报》记者向物美方面进行核实，截至发稿，未收到对方回复。
According to incomplete statistics, more than 1,300 respirators of the above three types have been recovered, and as of the date of dispatch, the China Business Administration has not received any reply from the other party regarding the stores and related data.
在物美多点购买口罩的张蔷（化名）向《中国经营报》记者谈起她的索赔经历时表示，她是从2月20日第一次拨打多点客服，拿到赔偿的时间是2月23日，历时3天。
Zhang Qiang, who bought the mask at Wumei Point, told China Business News about her claim, saying she first made multi-point customer service on February 20 and received compensation for three days on February 23.
而截至发稿，《中国经营报》记者从消费者自发组织的维权群不完全统计数据中发现，也就是从23日开始，陆续有购买物美口罩的消费者成功获得物美退一赔三的赔付。
As of the writing, the China Business Daily reporters from consumers spontaneously organized advocacy groups incomplete statistics, that is, from 23 onwards, the purchase of fine masks consumers have been successful in the United States and three compensation payments.
尽管已经获得相应赔偿，但很多消费者的索赔经历并不容易。
While compensation has been paid, many consumer claims have not been easy.
张蔷告诉《中国经营报》记者，她能在3天拿到赔偿已经算效率较高的了。
Tangqiang told China Business News that it would be more efficient for her to get compensation in three days.
“在这几天，我们在联系多点客服的时候，也会持续拨打12345和12315进行投诉，有的消费者还联系了食品药品监督局，寻求解决途径。
"Over the past few days, we have continued to make calls to 12345 and 12315 as we try to reach out to more customers, some of whom have contacted the Food and Drug Administration for solutions.
但现在仍有不少消费者还正在与门店沟通。
But there are still many consumers who are still communicating with stores.
”张蔷这几天的经历是大部分向物美索赔的消费者的一个缩影。
The experience of Tangqiang over the past few days is a microcosm of the majority of consumers seeking compensation from Wumei.
根据多位购买物美口罩的消费者的说法，他们基本都是通过上述方法联系门店。
According to a number of consumers buying face masks, they are basically through the above-mentioned ways to contact stores.
另有已经获得物美赔偿的消费者告诉《中国经营报》记者，自己去物美相关自提门店进行索赔的时候，会先签订一份协议书，签完字就可以获得相应赔偿。
Other consumers who have already been compensated tell China Business Daily that they will sign an agreement when they go to Wumei-related self-service stores to claim compensation.
对此，中友律师事务所律师王东跃表示：“与消费者签订这种和解协议，主要是为了避免以后产生新的民事纠纷。
Wang Dongyue, a lawyer at the China-US law firm, said: "The main reason for concluding such a settlement with consumers is to avoid new civil disputes in the future.
”索赔仍在路上与大多数购买物美口罩的消费者一样，不断拨打12315、12345、多点客服以及物美柜台的电话成为张蔷的日常。
The claim is still on the way. Like most consumers of face masks, Zhang Qiang has been making daily calls to 12,315, 12,345, multi-point customer service and the counter of Tangqiang.
幸运的是，张蔷最后得到了物美方相应的赔偿。
Fortunately, Tangqiang finally got the corresponding compensation from the United States of America.
不过，截至发稿，仍有不少消费者尚未得到物美的回应，事件也未得到相应的解决。
However, as of the writing, there are still many consumers have not received a good response, the incident has not been corresponding to solve.
《中国经营报》记者发现，在一个超过100人的物美口罩维权群里面，仍有部分消费者未获赔。
The China Business Daily found that in a group of more than 100 people to defend their rights to face masks, some consumers are still not compensated.
截至《中国经营报》记者发稿，据消费者自发组织的维权群不完全统计数据，在百人维权群中，双峪环岛店、潘家园店、清河店、惠新店、北洼路二店、志新店等15家物美门店大约卖出17盒、共计850个Scotts Maksks ASTM口罩，仅有3位消费者表示已成功获赔。
According to a report by the China Business Administration, among the 100 people who defend their rights, Shuangyu Around the Island, Panjiadian, Qinghe Shop, Hui Xindian, No.2 Shop, Zhi Xin Shop have sold about 17 boxes with a total of 850 Scotts Maksks ASTM masks.
庑殿路店、樊羊路店、望京麒麟社店、天通苑店、云岗大卖场店、朝阳路店、北太平庄店、沙河店8家店还未对售出的9盒、共计180个SAS N95 8617 Mask口罩进行理赔；有23家门店售出过Prestige Ameritech Face Masks医用口罩，目前尚有36盒、共计1800个口罩尚未成功退一赔三。
Of the nine SAS N95 8617 Mask Mask sold in each of the eight shops, 23 have sold the Prestige Americas Face Mask and 36 have yet to be returned, making a total of 1,800 masks.
如此计算，共计2830个口罩尚未收回或合理处理。
As a result, a total of 2,830 masks have not been recovered or reasonably disposed of.
记者就上述数据向物美方面求证，截至发稿，未收到物美的官方数据。
Reporters on the above-mentioned data to the United States, as of the manuscript, did not receive official data.
不过根据众多购买物美口罩的消费者的说法，目前除个别门店外，部分尚未获赔的消费者已经和物美门店或相关工作人员取得联系，对方称具体理赔在上报当中，消费者需等候通知。
However, according to many consumers who buy face masks, in addition to individual stores, some consumers have not yet been successful with the store or staff, said the specific claims in the report, consumers have to wait for notification.
但仍有一部分消费者表示目前仍未与门店取得联系。
Still, some consumers said they still haven't contacted the store.
“本来想协商好再去门店，但物美门店一直未联系我，准备直接去门店看看。
"I wanted to negotiate before I went to the store, but Womi did not contact me and was ready to go straight to the store.
”正在积极与物美门店沟通赔偿事宜的李磊（化名）告诉《中国经营报》记者：“我了解到目前有和我一样在天通苑购买同样口罩的消费者已经拿到赔付，因此我两次联系到天通苑店负责人寻求处理，但两次均遭到对方否认，对方至今也并未给我一个具体的解决方案。
Li Lei (not his real name), who is actively communicating with WPM about compensation, told China Business News: "I have learned that there are consumers like me who are buying the same masks in Tian Tong Yuan.
”针对上述情况，《中国经营报》记者致电中国消费者协会，相关工作人员表示，目前国家市场监管总局在严抓口罩事宜，建议向其反映。
In response, China Business Daily called the China Consumers' Association, where officials said the General Administration of Market Regulation was tightening its grip on masks and advised them to report it.
随后，国家市场监管总局相关负责人向《中国经营报》记者表示，根据《市场监管总局等八部门关于开展打击整治非法制售口罩等防护产品专项行动的紧急通知》，市场监管部门和药监部门会同有关部门会重点打击生产销售无生产日期、厂名厂址、产品质量合格证明等三无产品以及冒用认证标志等质量标志的行为，商标侵权、假冒专利、仿冒混淆、虚假宣传和虚假广告的行为。
According to the Emergency Notice of the General Administration of Market Supervision and Administration on launching special operations against illegal production and sale of respirators and other protective products, the market supervisory authorities and pharmaceutical supervisory departments together with relevant departments will focus on cracking down on the production and sale of products without production date, factory name, quality certificate and other quality marks.
而在消费者自发组织的维权群中，面临索赔困境的消费者远不止李磊一个。
Li Lei is not the only consumer to face the plight of claims in the advocacy group organized by consumers themselves.
截至发稿，物美方面并未就“问题口罩”事件作出公开说明或道歉。
As of the date of dispatch, the United States has not made a public explanation or apology for the "problem mask" incident.
对于物美关于“口罩事件”的具体赔付后续，《中国经营报》记者将持续关注和跟踪报道。
"China Business News" reporters will continue to pay attention and follow-up on the payment of the mask incident.
