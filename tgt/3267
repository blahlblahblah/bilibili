武汉，89所高校，一百万在校生，被一场疫情推入尴尬局面。
Wuhan, 89 colleges and universities, a million students, was pushed into an embarrassing situation by an epidemic.
回到家乡的学生，原本的年节过成了闭门不出的苦修，还要担心因为武汉返乡者的身份惹来麻烦；武汉本地的，又或者留在武汉的，则直面疫情最前线，和这座城市同呼吸。
Back home, the original festival has become a closed-door penance, but also worried about the status of Wuhan returnees caused trouble; Wuhan, or stay in Wuhan, face the forefront of the epidemic, and with the city breathing.
他们都在期待着开学，期待一切回归正轨，但开学的通知却迟迟没有下来，迎来的，只是一个个不知道何时结束的十四天。
They are looking forward to the start of school, looking forward to everything back on track, but the notice of the beginning of school has not come down, ushered in, only do not know when the end of 14 days.
在这些被疫情打乱计划的学生里，有一批人尤其煎熬——本该在六月拨穗的毕业生们。
Among the students whose plans were disrupted by the outbreak, a group suffered particularly - graduates who were supposed to be tweeting in June.
他们有的打算继续学业，复试、出国的各类计划却不得不搁置拖延；有的已经找好了工作，却不知道什么时候能拿到毕业证，完成走出象牙塔的第一步；还有的，无着无落，在疫情带来的焦虑里，一边完成着论文，一边为自己找寻出路。
Some plan to continue their studies, retest and go abroad, but others have to put off their plans; some have found work, but do not know when they will get their diplomas and complete the first step out of the ivory tower; and still others, without a roof over their heads, are finding their way through the anxiety caused by the epidemic.
按原计划，今年三月份静静该和同学们一起考英语专业八级，然后再开始正式准备论文，但现在，专八考试已然推迟。
According to the original plan, in March this year, students should quietly take an English test with the eighth level, then start to prepare a formal paper, but now, the eighth exam has been postponed.
她只能一边写论文，一边继续不知道什么时候结束的英语复习。
She could only write a paper while she continued studying English without knowing when it would end.
“本来可以每次只专注一件事，现在要一起做了，在家还免不了懒散拖沓。
"I could have focused on one thing at a time, but now I have to do it together.
”2020年2月17日，武汉大学启动网络授课。
On February 17, 2020, Wuhan University launched an online course.
原本没课的静静“蹭”了两门公选，在线上学习的特殊时期，蹭课很简单：加入公选课QQ群，按通知登录相应的app。
The original did not class quietly "rub" two public elections, online learning of the special period, the rubbing class is very simple: join the public elective QQ group, according to the notice registered corresponding app.
静静老家所在的镇子，道路已经管控她选了水彩画以及中国文学史，都是直播授课，氛围轻松，让她觉得疫情退去以后，这种授课形式也可以考虑保留。
Quiet home town, the road has been controlled she chose watercolor painting and Chinese literature history, all live, relaxed atmosphere, let her feel that the epidemic receded, this form of teaching can also be considered to retain.
“网课的好处就在于，大家在聊天框里什么都敢说。
"The advantage of tennis lessons is that everyone dares to say anything in a chat box.
”静静的考研初试成绩不错，现在在等着复试，她猜测复试很可能会采取远程线上模式，如果运气好，三月还能如期举行。
"Quiet test results are good, now waiting for the second test, she guessed that the second test will likely take a remote online mode, if lucky, can be held in March as scheduled.
静静老家的防疫标语2月29日，Echo终于给老师发完论文初稿，这天是导师给她的最后期限。
Quiet Home Slogan On Feb. 29, Echo finally handed her a first draft of her essay, a deadline given to her by her tutor.
从去年开始，Echo就读的学院采取全部盲审，如果有两个C或者以下评级，则至少需要修改三个月以后再答辩，相当于延毕，今年，这个政策进一步收紧。
Since last year, Echo's college has been completely blind, and if it has two C or less ratings, it needs to revise at least three months before responding, which is the equivalent of graduation. This year, the policy was further tightened.
2月底，学院曾下发通知，3月中旬查重，20日进行送审，留给学生的时间只有不到1个月，在学生集体申诉抗议下，院长出面了解情况后根据疫情造成的影响，制定了新的研究生学位申请时间表。
At the end of February, the College issued a circular that students would be given less than one month to reexamine in mid-March and be brought to trial on 20 March. In response to a student collective protest, the Director of the College intervened to establish a new schedule of applications for postgraduate degrees based on the impact of the epidemic.
新的学位申请工作时间节点Echo说，这版新的计划大大缓解了她的焦虑：“之前疫情严重的时候真的论文写不进去，现在好歹初稿都出来了，大不了慢慢改。
Echo, a new degree-application node, says the new plan greatly allayed her anxieties: "Before the epidemic hit, real papers weren't written, and now the first drafts are out, not too late.
”在过去的一个月里，她每天12点起床吃饭，下午做心理建设，然后6点开始写论文到凌晨2点。
"For the past month, she has eaten at 12 o'clock every day, done psychological building in the afternoon and started writing her thesis at 6 a.m.
至于毕业后的去向，Echo已经有了打算，就在北京的实习单位留用，“心里都有底吧，但是不得不说如果没有疫情按期开学的话，情况会比现在好得多。
As for where he will go after graduation, Echo has a plan to stay with his internship in Beijing. "I have a bottom in mind, but I have to say that things would have been much better if the epidemic hadn't started on schedule.
”Echo写论文时拍摄的打卡照被疫情隔离在武汉外，Milk只得按最坏的打算，“做好延毕的心理准备”。
Echo was quarantined by the outbreak in Wuhan as he wrote his paper, and Milk had to "prepare himself for the worst."
2月2日，华中师范大学曾发布通知，延迟2020年春季开学返校时间，遵照“推迟开学不停学”的原则，自2月12日起按原定正常教学周次安排开展网络教学和指导工作。
On February 2, Huazhong Normal University announced that it would postpone the start of the school year in the spring of 2020 and that, in keeping with the principle of "delaying the start of classes without stopping to learn," online teaching and guidance work began on 12 February on a regular weekly basis.
她的毕业设计从去年4月确定方向、8月开题，到现在已经准备了近一年的时间，计划里今年开学继续完成的毕设实验，如今遥遥无期。
Her graduation project, which began in April and August last year, is now almost a year away, and the planned Bi-Shen experiment, which starts this year, is far from over.
不能按时开展实验，就意味着没有数据，无法撰写论文。
Failure to carry out experiments on time means that there are no data and no papers to write.
被疫情关在家里，Milk只能不断查文献、完善实验程序。
Locked in his home by the outbreak, Milk had to constantly review the literature and perfect the lab procedures.
禁止出行前，Milk拍的家附近的草莓大棚许多同学也都受到了影响，有的人可以通过在网上收取数据完成实验，能够继续完成毕业设计。
Many students in the strawberry stall near Milk's house were also affected before the trip, and some were able to complete their graduation project by collecting data online.
然而Milk的毕设难以如此实施，只得作罢。
But Milk's Bicesse was so difficult to implement that it had to be stopped.
对于延毕，虽然父母有些不能接受，担心会对女儿的履历有不良影响，但Milk已经释然了。
Milk has been relieved to learn that his parents are reluctant to accept him for fear that it will have a negative impact on his daughter's resume.
“感觉人生一直在往前走没有停下来过，如果被迫按了暂停键，那就接受好了。
"It feels like life has been going on without stopping. If you're forced to push the pause button, take it.
我还年轻，没关系。
I'm young. That's okay.
”Milk在家做的自制蛋糕1月中旬，一直关注武汉疫情消息的父母曾经催促过KK回家，但她还是按计划留在了武汉。
"Milk's homemade cake In mid-January, her parents, who had been following the situation in Wuhan, urged her to return home, but she stayed as planned.
KK住在学校附近，封城后她加入了社区团购群，目前生活物资供应充足。
KK lived near the school, after the closure of the city she joined the community shopping group, the current supply of adequate supplies.
去年圣诞节前后，她就在网上看到过疫情的消息，由于网上“不存在人传人”的论调，又远离爆发点，KK并没意识到危险，还在计划着过年前后去附近的景区游玩。
KK didn't realize the danger and was planning to visit nearby scenic spots around the Chinese New Year because of the 'no-man-to-person' message on the Internet and its remoteness from flashpoints.
KK所住的社区一度实行三天一出门采买的政策1月26日，中南财经政法大学发布“防疫1号公告”，宣布推迟开学时间，具体时间另行通知。
KK community once practiced a three-day buy-out policy January 26, the University of Central and South China Finance, Economics and Law issued "epidemic prevention notice 1," announced the postponement of the opening time, until further notice.
原本并不长的假期，突然延长了。
What had not been a long vacation had suddenly been extended.
关在住处，KK完成了论文，自觉考研无望，她开始准备在网上找工作，“线上面试，会多一些不确定性吧”。
Shut up in her apartment, KK finished her thesis, she thought she was looking for a job online, "on-line interview, there will be more uncertainty."
封闭后，KK偶尔会在阳台上吹吹风这个假期，潘潘的任务并不轻松。
After the closure, KK occasionally blows a blow on the balcony this holiday, Pampan's task is not easy.
作为班长，她要及时在班级群内发布招聘信息，跟考公或者已经在外面实习的同学了解情况，还要每天统计同学在家是否有发热的情况。
As the monitor, she should publish the recruitment information in the class group in time, with the examiner or have internships outside the situation, but also every day to check whether students have fever at home.

On February 18, 39 students with close contact with Newcastle Pneumonia were admitted to the Jianghan University quarantine point. Prior to that, students' personal belongings in the requisitioned dormitory were packed by teachers.
潘潘的宿舍也在其中，对学校的决定，她表示出了充分的支持，“老师们打包得很仔细，也不怕东西会不见”。
Pampan's dorm room was among them, and she expressed full support for the school's decision, saying: "Teachers are packed carefully and are not afraid of seeing things."
潘潘的朋友圈截图截至目前，学校仍然没有下发开学通知，潘潘把自己每天的时间安排得很满，“不敢太闲，太闲会更焦虑”。
Pan's friend circle screenshot so far, the school has not issued a notice to start school, Pampan his daily schedule is very full, "too idle, too idle will be more anxious."
她毕业论文的题目是研究疫情对经济的影响，结合非典进行对比，做定性分析。

Due to the epidemic situation, the school plans to apply for, reply to and examine the graduation thesis (design) online on the basis of completing a double-choice project and a letter of assignment, said Jiang Han University on March 5.
但即使按期完成论文，潘潘依然面临着另一个严峻的问题。
But even if the paper is completed on schedule, Pan faces another serious problem.
由于年前拿到的offer并不满意，她原本将希望寄托于春招，疫情爆发后，春招难以如期举行，武汉的就业岗位数量也受到影响。
She was hoping for a spring break-out after the outbreak of the disease, which affected the number of jobs in Wuhan.

和他同一个小组的一位外地同学，如果没有好的论文选题，还能继续选择拍摄视频，但无疑，计划也被打乱了。
One of his fellow students from the same group would have continued to choose to shoot videos if he had not had a good essay topic, but no doubt the plan had been disrupted.
“突然改写论文，一开始肯定是措手不及的，好在学校酌情考虑放低了要求，论文字数只需要一万字。
"The sudden rewriting of the paper must have been taken aback at first. Fortunately, the school considered lowering the requirements, and the word count for the paper was only 10,000 words.
”一个月不到的时间，确定题目、提交开题报告，有些匆忙。
In less than a month, there was a rush to identify topics and submit opening reports.
由于论文涉及电影相关内容，小豪开始大量刷片，游戏和便于在家里开展的简单运动，成了生活的重要调剂。
With his thesis on film-related content, Howe began to brush lots of movies, games and simple exercises that were easy to carry out at home, becoming an important part of life.
疫情前，小豪新买的写真长期在家和家长相处，虽然并没有什么矛盾，但小豪依然觉得“有点麻木，想要跟新的人接触”。
Before the outbreak, Howe's new photo shoot had been at home with his parents for a long time. Although there was no conflict, Howe still felt "a little numb and wanted to get in touch with new people."
李安经典的家庭三部曲，最近又被他品出了新的味道。
Ang Lee's classic family trilogy was recently given a new flavor by him.
去伦敦留学的录取通知书早已到手，学生签证、体检等程序却无法办理，这让他更加期待疫情尽快结束。
Admission letters to study in London have long been received, but students visa, medical examination and other procedures can not be processed, which makes him even more eager to end the epidemic as soon as possible.
“很多事情都搁置了。
"A lot of things are on hold.
”小豪的朋友圈阿帕感觉自己周边受疫情的影响没那么大。
Mr Howe's circle of friends, Apa, felt less affected by the outbreak around him.
2月24日，武汉工商学院开始实行线上教学，2月底，阿帕已经刷够了足够的公选课学分。
On February 24, Wuhan Industry and Commerce Institute began to implement online teaching, at the end of February, Apa has brush enough public school credit.
由于学校在上学期开设过相关课程，他的开题报告也已经顺利提交，需要的文献也早在假期开始前准备齐全，只要按进度完成就行。
Since the school had held a course last semester, his opening report had been submitted smoothly, and the required documentation had been prepared well in advance of the start of the holiday, provided that it was completed on schedule.
在阿帕的计划里，疫情结束返回武汉后，他会直接在实习单位留用，虽然家人更想让他回呼和浩特——他们觉得武汉离家太远，压力太大。
Under Mr. Apa's plan, he would stay directly with his internship after returning to Wuhan after the outbreak, although his family would prefer him to return to Huhhot, which they felt was too far from home and too stressed.
阿帕下载的文献他身边的同学，大多也和他一样有清晰的目标：考研、国考、当老师，或者出国留学。
Most of the students around him have the same clear goals as he does: to take the postgraduate entrance examination, to be a teacher, or to study abroad.

当然，总有人被疫情突然打乱脚步。
Of course, there are always people who are suddenly disrupted by the epidemic.
听说一位同学因为工作压力，在1月21日之前辞了职，目前还没有着落，阿帕觉得问题不大，“总会有更好的单位”。
I heard that one of my classmates quit before January 21st because of the pressure of his job. So far, he hasn't found any problem.

”由于疫情，春招无法如期举行，对本就基数庞大的武汉应届生而言，就业形势无疑雪上加霜。
Because of the outbreak, the spring move could not be held as scheduled, on the huge base of Wuhan fresh students, the employment situation is undoubtedly worse.
