在阿风把两万六千余元善款打到武汉协和医院的账户上以后，TNA的直播结束了。
After Feng hit the account of Wuhan Concorde Hospital with more than 26,000 yuan, TNA's live broadcast ended.
。
.
阿风是国内游戏速通组织TNA速通会的组织者。
A Feng is the organizer of TNA Express, a domestic game speed communication organization.
每年的十月份，TNA都会联系一些速通玩家（Runner），举行一个持续数天的大型速通表演赛，纯粹出于爱好。
Every October, TNA will contact Runner for a big, quick-pass exhibition that lasts for a few days out of sheer love.
。
.
在最早做TNA的时候，阿风就想过有一天像GDQ那样，在出于爱好的同时，也能做一些能够帮助到其他人的事情。
When he first made TNA, Ah Feng thought that one day, like GDQ, he could do something that could help others, just like GDQ.
。
.
GDQ（Games Done Quick）是国外一个知名的慈善速通活动，创立于十年前。
GDQ (Games Done Quick) is a well-known charity fast-track activity abroad, founded a decade ago.
GDQ一年有两场固定的速通表演，其中一场是为癌症预防基金会筹款，另一场的收入会捐给无国界医生组织。
GDQ has two regular fast-track shows a year, one for the Cancer Prevention Foundation and the other for Médecins Sans Frontières.
十年来，GDQ总共筹集了超过2560万美元的善款。
In total, GDQ has raised more than $25.6 million over the past decade.
。
.
一月底，新冠肺炎的疫情愈发严重，阿风和另外一位组织者书生觉得，TNA或许能做一次特别版的速通表演赛，专门为疫区筹款。
At the end of January, as the outbreak of pneumonia deepened, Mr. Feng and another organizer felt TNA might be able to do a special quick-pass exhibition to raise money for the affected areas.
在前两年的活动里，他们认识了不少runner，就拉了一个群问大家有没有兴趣做一场为武汉募款的活动。
In the first two years of activities, they know a lot of Runner, a group to ask if you are interested in doing a fundraising campaign for Wuhan.
。
.
因为很多runner因为疫情都留在了老家，没有平时能够同时支持速通和直播的设备，他们以为会比较难办。
Because many runner are back home because of the epidemic, they don't have the usual devices to support both quick and live, which they think will be difficult.
结果大家的反应很积极，阿风本以为凑不足一天的节目内容，很快就变成了18个项目，够直播两天。
It turned out to be a very positive reaction, and Afeng, who thought he was putting together less than a day's content, quickly turned into 18 projects, enough for two days of live coverage.
。
.
找到了足够的runner，下一步是联系活动主持人。
Having found enough runner, the next step is to contact the event facilitator.
TNA邀请到了女王盐，还有之前的主持人老五。
TNA invited the queen salt, and the former host, five.
。
.
老五是武汉本地人，当时刚脱离医学观察期不久。
Wu was a native of Wuhan, shortly after he left medical observation.
2月8日，TNA这期特殊节目开播的第一天，老五准备了一个特殊的开幕式。
On February 8, the first day of TNA's special program, Five prepared a special opening ceremony.
。
.
他戴上口罩、骑着电动车去了趟户外，用手机给观众直播了现在的汉口。
He put on a mask, rode an electric car out of doors, and used his mobile phone to broadcast Hankou.
街道上空无一人，以往人满为患的汉口火车站和长途汽车站空空荡荡。
The streets were empty, the formerly overcrowded Hankou railway station and long-distance bus station empty.
最后，摄像头远远地看了一眼华南海鲜市场。
Finally, the camera took a distant look at the South China seafood market.
。
.
那两天的速通直播到很晚，除了《DOOM》《伊苏》《以撒的结合》这些常规项目，第二天还有runner给大家表演了《健身环大冒险》。
The two days were televised very late, with the exception of the routine "DoOM," "Isu" and "Isaac" and the next day Runner performed "The Ring of Fitness Adventures.
速通是小圈子，整个慈善活动的最高人气和原来正常播时候差不多。
Speed communication is a small circle, the entire charitable activities of the highest popularity and the original normal broadcast time.
但以往TNA办活动都亏本，这次他们的爱发电（一个粉丝赞助平台）里源源不断收到了数百笔支持，到最后一共有26773元。
But in the past, TNA has lost money on its campaigns, this time with hundreds of endorsements for TNA, a fan-sponsored platform, amounting to 26,773 yuan.
。
.
为了协助TNA更好筹款，爱发电还专门设计了特殊通道。
To help TNA raise more money, Love Power also has a special channel designed for it.
阿风提前联系好了武汉协和医院。
Ah Feng contacted Wuhan Concorde Hospital in advance.
速通结束后，他开启摄像头，当着观众的面把善款打进了医院的账户。
When it was over, he turned on the camera and opened the money into the hospital's account in front of the audience.
但是因为医院太忙了，阿风暂时没有让医院开具反馈，“等疫情结束再说吧。
But because the hospital was too busy, Mr. Feng didn't ask the hospital to give him feedback for the time being.
”。
"
书生很感慨。
The scholar was deeply moved.
他负责TNA的技术支持，以往，速通圈基本都是凭借一腔热爱做活动，国内的组织成熟度也比不上国外，基本上就是个大家聚一起玩儿的行为。
He is in charge of TNA's technical support. In the past, the speed loop has been based on a love of doing activities, the domestic organization maturity is not comparable to foreign countries, basically it is everyone's behavior.
“看了那么多年的GDQ，看他们做了那么多的事情，这次才知道，国内速通圈的动员力比我们想象的要强的多。
"After watching GDQ for so many years and seeing how many things they have done, this time it became clear that the mobilization of domestic speed circles is much stronger than we thought.
”。
"
“动员力”，可能是这次疫情里所有民间救济行为中最关键的词。
"Mobilization" is probably the most crucial of all civilian relief operations in this outbreak.
。
.
水滴在一家电竞公司上班。
Water droplets are working for a company called Atletico.
因为提前在网络上看到疫情的消息，她过年没回南方老家，选择留在了北京。
Because she saw the epidemic on the network ahead of time, she did not go back to her hometown in the New Year and chose to stay in Beijing.
。
.
大年二十九，武汉封城。
About 29 years old, the city of Wuhan.
同时大量湖北医院物资告急，在互联网上发布接受社会捐赠的消息。
At the same time, a large number of hospitals in Hubei Province are in urgent need of materials.
一开始她想捐钱，结果发现疫区最缺的是医疗物资，“就觉得什么也做不了，挺无力的”。
At first, she wanted to donate money, only to find that the worst shortage of medical supplies in the affected areas, "feel that nothing can be done, rather powerless."
。
.
因为之前有做公益的经验，她被朋友拉进了一个支援武汉的志愿者群。
Because of her previous pro bono experience, she was pulled into a support group of volunteers in Wuhan by her friends.
群主联系到了一些武汉当地的车队，能够直接把物资定点捐到有需要的医院。
The group contacted a number of Wuhan local convoys and was able to donate supplies directly to hospitals in need.
虽然群里的志愿者们之前都没有这方面工作的经验，但很快就动员了起来。
Although the volunteers in the group had no previous experience in the field, they soon mobilized.
。
.
群里有人去对接医院，审核医院的物资缺口信息，大概一共收集了一百多家医院的信息。
Some people in the group went to docking the hospital, checking the material gap information of the hospital, probably collected a total of more than 100 hospital information.
一部分人负责对接物资，确保从厂家拿到的物资符合医院标准。
Some are responsible for docking supplies to ensure that supplies received from manufacturers are up to hospital standards.
最后，群里再组织车队送到武汉。
Finally, the group organized the convoy to Wuhan.
水滴差不多每天要忙到两三点才能睡。
Water droplets stay up to two or three o'clock almost every day.
。
.
水滴团队的志愿者进入前线。
Volunteers from the Droplet Team entered the front line.
最开始，进武汉的物流还没出现限制，他们能直接把物资送进城里。
At the beginning, the logistics into Wuhan has not appeared restrictions, they can send directly into the city.
但到后来，事情的进展有点出乎预料。
But then things went a little unexpectedly.
先是有规定说物资到了武汉会被统一验收，水滴以为是物资由红十字会代收，可能会统一放到仓库里来不及发放。
First there are provisions that materials will be unified in Wuhan acceptance, water droplets think that the Red Cross collection of materials, may be unified into the warehouse in time for distribution.
。
.
结果再过了段时间，他们连物资过省都会受到阻碍。
As a result, over time, they would be prevented from crossing the border even with supplies.
为了规避这种情况，水滴的团队想了对策，不直接说把货发到医院，而是运到当地的民宅，然后再通过网络找到当地的志愿者去拉货，送到有需要的医院。
To circumvent the situation, the droplet team came up with a solution that involved shipping the goods not directly to the hospital, but to local homes, where they could find local volunteers to pick up the goods and deliver them to hospitals in need.
。
.
1月26日，民政部规定外地慈善组织/志愿服务组织不得进入湖北。
On 26 January, the Ministry of Civil Affairs banned non-resident charitable / voluntary organizations from entering Hubei province.
有一次，志愿团队联系到了一位武汉当地的司机Y。
On one occasion, the volunteer team contacted a local Wuhan driver, Y.
Y当天领了2000个口罩，要运往三家医院。
Y took 2,000 masks the same day and had them transported to three hospitals.
结果第三家医院给错了地址，死活送不到。
As a result, the third hospital was given the wrong address and could not be delivered.
他只能顺路免费接送来往的医务人员，跑了一整天，只吃了一顿饭。
He had to drop in the medical staff free of charge all day and ate only one meal.
。
.
到了晚上的时候，Y告诉大家，他开始咳嗽了。
In the evening, Y told everyone that he began to cough.
他说，“我自己明天会送完这批货，就不要感染别人了。
"I'll finish the shipment myself tomorrow, so don't infect anyone else," he said.
”。
"
我问水滴，“那他现在确诊了吗？”。
I asked the drip, "Is he diagnosed now?"
“不知道。
"I don't know.
再也没有联系过我们了。
We've never been contacted again.
”。
"
随着时间推移，联系物资也变得越来越难。
Contacts have also become increasingly difficult over time.
刚开始水滴还能问到国内的厂家，后来厂家都被征用全部都归国家统一调配，团队就开始联系海外渠道，找包机、找物流、对接资源。
At the beginning of the water droplet can also ask the domestic manufacturers, then all the manufacturers were requisitioned under the unified national allocation, the team began to contact overseas channels, find charter, find logistics, docking resources.
。
.
水滴最多的一次联系上了60万个口罩，是美国一家石油公司的储备，总价500多万元人民币。
The largest number of water droplets ever made contact with 600,000 masks, a reserve of an American oil company worth more than five million yuan.
如果能有一家大机构马上为这批货买单，这60万个口罩马上就能送到中国。
The 600,000 masks could be delivered to China if a large agency paid for them immediately.
。
.
但是没有。
But no.
水滴只能定下了这批口罩，然后想办法去找一批小企业去凑这个钱。
The water droplets could only fix the masks and find a way to scrape together the money from a group of small businesses.
结果第二天早上，美国宣布所有本土航空公司前往中国的航班都停运。
As a result, the next morning, the United States announced that all flights to China by domestic airlines had been suspended.
再然后，口罩厂商想要从石油公司收回那批被定下的口罩，水滴和口罩厂商展开了无止境的邮件Battle.。
Then the mask maker wants to take back the mask from the oil company, and the water droplets and mask makers have endless mail.
相应地，水滴的团队联系的医院，对物资的要求变得越来越低。
Correspondingly, the droplet team contacted the hospital, the material requirements became lower and lower.
刚开始捐助的过程中，湖北各大医院的要求还很高，口罩必须要求N95，连KN95可能都不能用。
At the beginning of the donation process, the major hospitals in Hubei are still very high requirements, masks must be N95, even KN95 may not be usable.
到后来，像黄冈、襄阳这种非重点地区的医院，物资越用越少，对规格几乎已经没有需求了。
Later, hospitals in non-priority areas such as Huanggang and Xiangyang saw fewer supplies and little demand for specifications.
。
.
因为要沟通物资，他们的志愿群里也进来了各式各样的人。
As a result of the communication of supplies, their volunteer corps has also entered a wide variety of people.
发国难财的，骗口罩的骗子，坐地起价的微商……很多手里拿着口罩的微商在群里坐地起价，“关键是，你不买的话，这批货马上就没了”。
The key is, if you don't buy it, it's going to go away. "The bottom line is, if you don't buy it, it's going to be gone.
。
.
她对我说，疫情能彰显出人性特别本真的一面，包括公益组织在内。
She told me that the epidemic showed a particularly real side of human nature, including pro bono groups.
对很多慈善基金会来说，平时最大的问题是募款，但这一次募款太简单了，只要开一个通道，马上就会有很多钱进来。
For many charitable foundations, the biggest problem is fundraising, but this time it's too simple, as long as one channel, there will be a lot of money coming in.
。
.
但这些善款有没有都花出去？没人知道。
But is all this money spent? No one knows.
水滴关注的一个基金会，募了特别多钱，但最后公示只捐了6台洗衣机和一点点口罩。
Water Drop Concern, a foundation that raised extra money, ended up donating only six washing machines and a few face masks.
。
.
甚至就连医院也会产生这种“黑洞”。
Even hospitals can produce such black holes.
因为物资是消耗品，需要储备，医院也不知道某个数字的物资到底够不够用，就会一直不停地发物资紧缺的通告。
Because supplies are consumables and need to be kept in reserve, hospitals do not know whether a given number of items are sufficient or not, and they will keep issuing notices of shortages.
。
.
做了一个星期，志愿团队已经筋疲力尽。
After doing it for a week, the volunteer team was exhausted.
期间，可能是因为自动检测关键词的原因，水滴的微信还被封了两次，加上非公益组织的团体募捐可能有非法集资风险，团队就中断了直接捐助物资的运作，改为做信息对接。
In the meantime, perhaps because of automatic keyword detection, the water droplet was blocked twice, and the collection of donations by groups of non-public organizations may pose a risk of illegal fund-raising, and the team suspended the direct donation of goods and replaced it with information docking.
现在，水滴主要在企业、货源和医院之间做沟通，帮助物资落实到具体的地方。
Now, water droplets mainly in enterprises, sources of goods and hospitals to do communication, to help materials to specific places.
。
.
她在业余时间做过很久的公益，跟我说以前那种透支的感觉，“其实你好像改变了什么，又什么也没改变。
She did something pro bono in her spare time and told me about the overdraft. "You seem to have changed something and nothing has changed.
你在这里出点力，在别的地方就找补回来了，你太渺小了。
You do something here, you make it up somewhere else, you're too small.
”之后，她更愿意做点对点的帮助，确保每一笔捐赠都能帮助到一个切实的目标。
After that, she was more than willing to help each other by making sure that every donation helped to achieve a practical goal.
。
.
这几天，水滴已经在家恢复办公了。
Water droplets have been returning to work at home these days.
她很担心行业的未来。
She worries about the future of the industry.
游戏还好，她所从事的电竞行业主要以线下为主，好不容易国家开始扶持了，又赶上了疫情。
The game is good, she engaged in the power competition industry mainly online, hard to start to support the country, and catch up with the epidemic.
现在，线下禁止聚集，赛事全面停摆，所有人只能等。
Now, under-the-line prohibition of aggregation, full stop of the event, all can only wait.
。
.
与此同时，还会有亲戚朋友听闻她在做物资，跑过来问她，你那有口罩卖吗？。
At the same time, relatives and friends will hear that she is making supplies, run over to ask her, do you have a mask to sell?
“我就很想说，我自己都没口罩呢。
"I'd love to say that I don't even have a mask myself.
”水滴在通话里对我苦笑。
"Water droplets on the phone smiled at me bitterly.
。
.
对很多民间的志愿者来说，“口罩”变成了他们在私力救济里的第一课。
For many folk volunteers, the mask has become their first lesson in private relief.
。
.
彭浩是一名普通的腾讯员工。
Peng Hao is an ordinary Tencent employee.
他在武汉大学念的书，爸妈也都在湖北。
He studied in Wuhan University, his parents are also in Hubei.
在在疫情开始逐渐严重时，公司里认识的很多湖北籍的员工都选择了春节留在深圳过年，没有回家。
In the beginning of the epidemic began to serious, the company knew many Hubei staff have chosen to stay in Shenzhen Spring Festival, did not return home.
。
.
当时有同事提议说，我们回不去，又是湖北人，能不能为家乡做点事？彭浩就牵头组织了一个民间志愿团队，主要是腾讯的员工和之前在腾讯工作过的一些朋友。
'If we can't go back, we're Hubei people, can we do something for our hometown? 'Mr. Peng took the lead in organizing a civilian volunteer team, mainly Tencent's employees and some friends who worked for Tencent before.
。
.
和水滴类似，彭浩的团队刚开始主要是自行开展物资捐助，最重头的物资就是口罩。
Similar to the water droplets, Peng Hao's team started out largely on its own, with the heaviest supplies being masks.
为了筹钱，首先要有人负责出募捐的文案宣传，然后是找到靠谱的厂家、联系医院，还要有人负责在核实后把物资和有需求的医院做对接，整个团队到最后参与进来的差不多有一百来人。
In order to raise money, one has to be responsible for fund-raising paperwork, then find reliable manufacturers, contact hospitals, and be responsible for docking the material and the hospital in need after verification.
。
.
部分湖北医院给彭浩团队的口罩接收函。
Some Hubei hospital to Peng Hao team received the mask letter.
在捐助过程中，志愿团队遭遇了很多问题。
In the donor process, volunteer teams have encountered a number of problems.
他们联系到有些供货方，会跟你说有几万个口罩，然后团队就要去核实，看有没有三证，再去找医院。
They contact some suppliers and tell you that there are tens of thousands of masks, and then the team has to check to see if there are three and go to the hospital.
但在疫情里，可能每个人都有热心，每个人都有爱心——却很难说动机或者目的，。
But in an epidemic, everyone may be enthusiastic, everyone is loving - but it's hard to say what the motive or purpose is.
彭浩遇到了很多中间商，会仰仗有独家拿货渠道，从志愿团队这里赚抽点，“厂商出过来只要两块三，卖给我们是两块五或者两块六。
Peng Hao met a lot of middlemen, will rely on the exclusive access to goods, from the voluntary team here to earn some, "manufacturers for two and three, sold to us is two and a half or two and a half.
”。
"
到了2月2号左右，因为国家把很多物资渠道征用了，加上做直接援助不够专业，彭浩的团队就开始转型做信息对接。
Around February 2, Peng Hao's team began to transform itself into an information interface, as the state requisitioned many supplies and direct aid was not professional enough.
。
.
因为群里有很多腾讯的前员工，现在可能在做媒体、在别的企业做负责人，还有不少是创业的老板，私人资源比较丰富，确保了信息整合的有效性，大家基本上都会去找认识的、有信誉背书的熟人。
Because there are so many former Tencent employees in the group, they may now be in the media, in charge of other companies, and many are entrepreneurs, with plenty of private resources to ensure the effectiveness of information consolidation, everyone will basically look for acquaintances they know who have a reputation for endorsement.
。
.
大疆有一位负责人想要捐4000个护目镜，因为曾经和彭浩合作过，就通过他的团队对接到了湖北的医院。
One person in charge in Xinjiang wanted to donate 4000 goggles, because he had cooperated with Peng Hao and received the hospital in Hubei through his team.
加上团队里有很多湖北人，可以通过私人关系直接联系到当地，让他们团队可以确保在线下对医院和供货方进行确认和核实。
With many Hubei people on the team, you can contact the local area directly through personal relationships so that their teams can ensure that hospitals and suppliers are identified and verified offline.
。
.
前几天，彭浩的群里进来了一个人，说自己是伊能静，想要捐物资。
A few days ago, Peng Hao's group came in a man, said he was Yineng quiet, want to donate materials.
大家一开始都怀疑是不是本人，沟通后发现确实是伊能静的经纪团队，在国内外采购了很多物资，想要捐给需要的医院。
At first, we all doubted whether I was the person, after the communication found that it is indeed Yinjing's broking team, in the domestic and foreign procurement of a lot of materials, want to donate to the hospitals in need.
。
.
在沟通后，伊能静的经纪团队负责和工厂谈价钱签合同，彭浩的团队帮她看物资是否合规、帮他们联系信息列表里的医院，看哪些医院需要哪些物资，在发货后监督物流过程，确保捐赠方能拿到医院的接收函。
After the communication, Ieng's broking team was responsible for negotiating the contract with the factory at a price. Peng's team helped her to see if the supplies were in order, contact the hospitals on the information list, see which hospitals needed what, monitor the logistics process after delivery, and ensure that donors received the letters from the hospital.
上周，51.5万副医疗手套送到了医院的门口。
Last week, 515,000 pairs of medical gloves arrived at the hospital's entrance.
。
.
伊能静捐助后发的微博：“愿这世界不需要逆行者、没有吹哨人”。
Yi Nengjing donates the microblogging that sends after: "May this world do not need the inverse, do not whistle the person."
彭浩说，民间救援的一个价值点，就是民间渠道能够基于个人背书和信任，做好官方渠道的一个补位，确保能实际找到人。
Peng Hao said that a value point of folk rescue, is that private channels can be based on personal endorsement and trust, do a good job of official channels to ensure that people can actually find people.
。
.
“在灾难的面前，一个人的力量是很单薄的。
"In the face of disaster, a person's strength is very thin.
捐个物资，要有人绘制表格、核实信息、对接资源……湖北的医院可能已经忙疯了，他们箭在弦上，没有时间也没有力量来做这些事情，就只能我们来做。
Donate materials, need someone to draw the form, verify the information, docking resources... Hubei hospital may already be busy crazy, they do not have the time and strength to do these things, we have to do.
”。
"
疫情期间腾讯文档也推出了方便使用的特殊制式表格。
Tencent documents during the epidemic also introduced a special format form that is easy to use.
截止到2月14日晚八点，根据丁香园疫情实时动态，新冠肺炎疫情今日全国新增确诊人数5107例，累计确诊63946例。
As of 8: 00 p.m. on February 14, according to the real-time epidemic situation in clove orchards, 5,107 new cases of pneumonia have been confirmed nationwide today, with a total of 63,946 cases confirmed.
。
.
对比春节时期告急的情况，现在仍有大量湖北省内的医院在接受来自社会的捐赠，甚至包括新建的雷神山医院在内。
In contrast to the urgent situation during the Spring Festival, there are still a large number of hospitals in Hubei Province that are receiving donations from the public, including the newly built Lei Shenshan Hospital.
。
.
而这两天，很多地区的企业已经陆续开始复工。
Over the past two days, businesses in many areas have begun to resume work.
我所联系的志愿者们，只是疫情里的一部分普通人——和游戏行业相关的，在尽力帮助抗疫的普通人。
The volunteers I contacted were just some of the ordinary people in the epidemic - people associated with the game industry, trying to help the common people against the disease.
彭浩的志愿组织还在维持信息对接平台，水滴那批被扣下的口罩还在协商，我们仍然不知道疫情会在哪天退去。
Peng Hao's voluntary organization is also maintaining the information docking platform, the water droplet of that seized mask is still under negotiation, we still do not know when the epidemic will recede.
。
.
我想向阿风要一些TNA直播的画面放在文章里，看看在那次慈善速通里，网友们说了些什么。
I would like to ask Feng for some live TNA images to put in the article, to see what the netizens said in that charity flash.
但因为录播软件出了点问题，阿风还在陆续捣鼓那两天的录像，只能给我发一些截图。
But because there was something wrong with the recording software, Ah Feng continued to tamper with the two-day video, only to send me some screenshots.
我看到在直播最后，活动结束的画面里，很多弹幕刷起了“《意义》”。
I see that at the end of the live broadcast, a lot of the shrapnel is brushed with "Meaning."
。
.
“意义”一直是速通圈的一个梗。
Meaning has always been a stumbling block in the speed loop.
在一个游戏上花费大量精力，绞尽脑汁只为了节省一点点通关时间，经常会遭受一些诘问，“你们做这些有什么意义呢？”。
Spending a lot of energy on a game, trying to save a little bit of clearance time, is often questioned, "What's the point of all this?"
至少这一次，他们有了确切的答案。
This time, at least, they had a definite answer.

你说到钱权如风吹鸡蛋壳，不堪一击，稍微想想，好像也是，因为泥潭深渊吞噬一切。
You said the right to money like the wind blowing chicken eggshell, vulnerable, a little think, as if so, because the abyss swamp everything.
外围的生命只是运气好，没有身陷其中。
Life on the periphery is just luck, not trapped in it.
结局还远远未到来，个人难道还不能计算到自身未来？未免对自己太不负责任了吧。
The end is far from over. Can't individuals calculate their own future? It would be irresponsible of them.

这次战时演练反映出越靠近战场越危险，避之则吉。
The war drill showed that the closer you get to the battlefield, the more dangerous it is to avoid.
非战士求生只能靠钱权势打通三尺天地自保，火与血面前，除了拳头便只有逃跑。
Non-warriors can only survive on money and power to open three feet of self-defense, fire and blood, except for the fist to escape.
正是平民没得选择，难以承担的代价驱使大家争先恐后各师各法，拉后腿意味着有机会，时间证实谣言始于智者。
It is the civilian population that has no choice, the cost of which is too great to bear, the opportunity to pull back and the time to confirm that rumours start with the wise.
最简单一点，口罩五块钱买不到，那五十了，五百了？因为知晓自己是一个自私的人，所以最大的贡献只有不连累人，尊重战士不敢自利。
At its simplest, five dollars for a mask, fifty, five hundred? Knowing that you are a selfish person, the greatest contribution is not to involve people, respect soldiers do not dare to self-interest.

不，这次恰恰说明钱权不是一切，没有无数人的奉献牺牲，你的钱和权也只是来去匆匆而已。
No, this is exactly what the right to money is not everything, no countless people sacrifice, your money and power just come and go in a hurry.

这次灾难，很直白告诫所有人，人是分三六九等，钱权势作用下弱者只有几个受运气眷顾。
This disaster, very straightforward admonition to all people, people are divided into six and nine, money and power in the weak only a few lucky.
赚钱要紧呐，如果想保持自我的话。
Money matters, if you want to be yourself.
