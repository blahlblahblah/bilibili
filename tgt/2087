\ 💪 /2020年的开头，一场突如其来的疫情让所有行业都笼罩在阴影之下，创意产业也无法幸免。
At the beginning of the year, a sudden outbreak overshadowed all sectors, including the creative industries.
工作要么被取消，要么无限延期；每天紧盯确诊人数的变化，似乎也失去了创作的心情……疫情之下的你们都还好吗？迷盒为我们设计了这篇专访的封面图，感谢！自从疫情发生以来，整个创意行业也几乎进入了半停滞的状态。
Jobs are either canceled or postponed indefinitely; every day the changes in the number of people diagnosed seem to have lost their creative moods... Are you all right with the epidemic? The cover of this interview was designed for us, thank you! The creative industry has almost reached semi-standstill since the outbreak.
摄影师们的商业拍摄几乎全数取消，平面设计师们所用的工厂停工，时装设计师们的订货会延期，模特们也因为出入境受限而无法参加时装周……每天接踵而至的坏消息和种种的不确定性让焦虑的情绪开始在创意行业内渐渐蔓延。
Photographers are canceling almost all their commercial filming, graphic designers are closing their factories, fashion designers are postponing their orders, and models are unable to attend fashion weeks because of restrictions on entry and exit... The daily torrent of bad news and uncertainty is beginning to spread through the creative industry.
面对这样的情势，身处创意行业的人们此刻在思考些什么？他们又有什么样的应对办法？Voicer采访了6位创意行业内不同分支的同侪，分享这次疫情对他们的影响以及他们相应的思考和应对策略。
In the face of this situation, what are the people in the creative industries thinking about at the moment? What is their response? Voicer interviewed six peers in different branches of the creative industry to share the impact of the epidemic on them and their corresponding thinking and coping strategies.
希望他们的回答能够为大家带来一些启发，帮助大家一起携手度过这段艰难的时光。
I hope their answers will be enlightening and help you through this difficult time together.
刘治治 & 迷盒著名平面设计师，立入禁止&拂一个山坡联合创始人。
Rita Lau & amp; amp; P; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot;
立入禁止于2015年重组，由设计取向完全不同的创意人组成，他们从事平面设计、插图、交互界面、出版、策划展览……几乎涵盖了平面设计的所能接触到的方方面面，具有极强的跨域性。
The entry ban was reconstituted in 2015, and is composed of creative people with completely different design orientations, who work in graphic design, illustration, interactive interface, publishing, planning exhibitions... covering almost every aspect of graphic design that is accessible and highly cross-cutting.
尽管工作室已出现工龄15年以上的“老人”，但立入禁止依旧是个极其年轻的团队。
Although the studio has been working for more than 15 years "old people," the ban is still a very young team.
为abC独立艺术书展设计的全新视觉系统“设计的三个端头：设计师、客户和供应商都受到了影响”我们团队有几个设计师是湖北籍的，大家回到北京来都比较困难，就算是突破重重封锁回来了，也需要在家隔离14天。
The new visual system designed for the ABC Independent Art Exhibition "Design Three Endpoints: Designers, Clients and Suppliers Are Affected." Several of our team's designers are Hubei, and it will be difficult for all of us to return to Beijing, even if we break through the blockade and stay in isolation for 14 days.
设计这件事在线上其实并不能充分沟通，我们也尝试过远程办公的形式，但是这样的方式没有办法实时反馈，沟通效率还是比较低的。
We have tried telecommuting, but there is no real-time feedback in this way. Communication efficiency is low.
客户方面，我们服务的客户很多都是做人群聚合的项目，比如展览、大型活动等等， 所以有很多项目都推迟或者是不做了。
On the customer side, many of the clients we serve are crowd-aggregation projects, such as exhibitions, large events, etc., so many projects are delayed or not done.
本来还有一个电影节项目，但是现在入境出境都有问题，电影节本身又是人群聚集的活动，所以仍在观望政策和疫情走向，是否举办还是未知数。
There was also a film festival, but now there are problems with entry and exit, and the festival itself is a mass event, so we are still watching the policy and the course of the epidemic, whether it will be held or not is unknown.
一些公司也无心在这个时候改变视觉形象。
Some companies are not interested in changing their visual image at this time.
比如说之前有一个客户，是线上订购甜品的公司，找到我们想做一个标志的升级。
For example, before there was a customer, a company that ordered desserts online, found us wanting to do a logo upgrade.
节前没时间聊，等最近再联系上的时候客户说自己每月损失近百万，原材料进不来，员工工资还得照发。
No time to talk before the festival, and so on the recent contact customers said that they lost nearly a million dollars a month, raw materials can not enter, staff wages have to be paid.
供应商也是设计里非常重要的一个环节，设计师仅仅是设计、作图而已，具体实现这些设计还是要依靠供应商。
Supplier is also a very important part of the design, the designer is only the design, drawing, the specific implementation of these designs or to rely on suppliers.
现在印刷厂至少三月才能开工，很多南方的供应商已经倒闭了。
Printing plants cannot begin work until at least March, and many suppliers from the south have closed down.
我们本来打算做一本2020年的鼠年日历，打样都做完了，树脂材料也进口了，但是现在一切都停滞了。
We were going to make a mouse calendar for the year 2020. We finished proofing and the resin materials were imported, but now everything is at a standstill.
为云南菜餐厅一坐一忘IN&OUT更新的主视觉设计“这次疫情炸出了很多人的脆弱”我们团队总共有9个人，比较不巧的是有一个刚回北京来的员工隔壁单元就有一个确诊，所以他现在比较担心，情绪不是很好。
"This outbreak has left many people vulnerable." Our team includes nine people. Unfortunately, one employee recently returned to Beijing with a diagnosis in the next room, so he's worried about being in a bad mood.
大家现在也都每天量体温，处在一个比较焦虑的情绪里。
Everyone is also taking temperature every day and is in a state of relative anxiety.
这次疫情炸出了很多人的脆弱，当你的内心世界不平静的时候，其实是无法去做设计相关的事的。
This outbreak of vulnerability of many people, when your inner world is not calm, is not able to do design-related things.
现在客户更加谨慎，预算不会再像疫情之前一样充裕了，但是长期来看，不觉得设计行业会有一个洗牌。
Customers are now more cautious and budgets are no longer as plentiful as they were before the epidemic, but in the long run there is no sense of a shuffle in the design industry.
因为设计行业有它的特殊性，平面工作室主要还是看设计质量。
Because the design industry has its particularity, the plane studio mainly depends on the quality of the design.
在一段时间的沉寂之后，序列还是会保持的，只是可能服务的行业会有变化。
After a period of silence, the sequence will remain, but the industries that may be served will change.
疫情之后我们可能会更多地宣传一下自己，整理一下以前没过稿的作品之类的。
After the outbreak, we may be able to publicize ourselves more, to sort out previously unwritten works and so on.
我们可能不会考虑改变业务的范围，即便我们做一些生活方式类的东西，平面设计还是我们的基础。
We may not consider changing the scope of our business, even if we do something lifestyle-like, graphic design is our foundation.
为Full Monty打造的视觉系统设计“治世之能臣，乱世之饭桶”平面设计是一件锦上添花的事，疫情之下做设计，的确显得有些百无一用。
The graphic design for Full Monty's visual system, "a minister of the world, a luncheon in chaos," is a plus, and it is safe to design in the face of an epidemic.
设计师是“治世之能臣，乱世之饭桶”。
Designer is "the minister of the world, the mess of the bucket."
治世的时候，设计师的任务是保证这个世界有趣，有多样性；但情况反过来的话，谈多样性多少显得有些不合时宜。
At the time of governance, the designer's task was to ensure that the world was interesting and diverse; but, conversely, it seemed somewhat out of place to talk about diversity.
在相对繁荣的社会里，人们对审美和精神的需求大，我们的工作才有效。
In a relatively prosperous society, our work is effective only if there is a great need for beauty and spirituality.
一旦我们转换成一个刚需社会，在人们忙于满足马斯洛需求里最底层的那些需求的时候，审美、精神、美学、生活方式会不会持续走低，这个低潮会持续多久，这是一个让设计师焦虑的问题。
It is a matter of concern to designers whether aesthetics, spirituality, aesthetics and lifestyle will continue to decline as we transform into a just-in-need society, as people struggle to meet the needs of those at the bottom of Maslow's needs.
《开放之城——清明上河图香港展》视觉系统设计“记住苦难比打气加油重要”疫情发生之后，做什么事情之前都会想：意义是什么。
"Open City - The Hong Kong Exhibition of the Qingming River" Visual System Design "Remember Suffering Is More Important than Cheer up" Before doing anything, think: What's the meaning?
现在的我们无法做无关痛痒的事情。
Now we can not do innocuous things.
设计师最大的力量是在疫情过去之后帮助人们葆有对这段时间苦难的记忆，而不是吆喝口号式地加油打气。
The greatest strength of designers is to help people maintain memories of this period of suffering after the epidemic, rather than yelling for encouragement.
非典过去17年了，人们对此的记忆都已经淡却了，其中的一点原因就是：艺术家也是健忘者之一。
The memory of SARS has faded for 17 years, not least because artists are also forgetful.
没有人在每年三月四月的时候纪念非典，电影人没有拍很多相关的纪录片。
No one celebrates SARS in April of each year, and the filmmakers don't make many documentaries about it.
记住苦难是比打气加油重要得多的，为什么非典之后又重蹈覆辙，就是因为大家没有在事件过后好好梳理。
Remember that suffering is much more important than cheering up. Why did SARS happen again after SARS was because we didn't clean it up after the event?
Cici项偞婧模特、艺术推广者Cici为《ELLE》杂志所拍摄的作品“春色视界”“很多中国设计师不得不缺席时装周”国外相对影响还是小一些，国内的工作基本上都取消掉了。
"Many Chinese designers had to be absent from fashion week." Relative foreign influence was small, and jobs at home were largely eliminated.
我之前有个原定3月初的工作最终因为疫情的发展而不得不取消了。
I had a job scheduled for early March that had to be cancelled because of the outbreak.
伦敦这边有个之前就定好的工作，还是顺利完成了。
There was a pre-determined job on this side of London, which was successfully completed.
本来2月中旬在巴黎有个拍摄工作，但是因为疫情的影响，原定的中国摄影师和团队无法顺利出国，于是全部换成了国外制作团队，我听说国内一些杂志的印刷厂甚至已经不运作了。
There was shooting in Paris in mid-February, but because of the epidemic, the original Chinese photographers and teams were unable to get out of the country.
很多中国设计师也不得不取消时装周的计划，中国人这次全面缺席时装周，肯定还是会有非常大的负面影响的。
Many Chinese designers have had to cancel the fashion week, the overall absence of the Chinese fashion week, there is bound to be a very negative impact.
Cici和她的小伙伴们捐赠的物资“来伦敦的第一周运送了三批物资，没怎么睡觉”到目前，我们已经成功运送了三批物资，今天坐火车去伦敦往东一个半小时路程的一个地方，是为了准备发往杭州的第四批物资。
"Cici and her friends have donated" three shipments of goods in the first week of London without much sleep. "So far, we have successfully delivered three consignments, and today we are travelling by train to a place an hour and a half east of London in preparation for the fourth shipment to Hangzhou.
因为采购物资用的是大家募捐的钱，所以我必须去一趟，把货物清点一遍。
I must go and count the goods, for they are purchased with the aid of the fund-raisers.
募捐物资的整个流程非常复杂，包括筹钱、找物资、校对物资、算明细、找物流、清关、对接医院内部人员、确认收货等等，这其中充满了大量需要核实的细节。
The whole process of collecting funds is very complicated, including raising money, finding supplies, checking supplies, calculating details, finding logistics, clearing customs, docking hospital staff, confirming receipt, etc., which is full of details that need to be verified.
我是第一次做这件事情，一切都比想象的复杂太多，而且当中充满了变数。
It was the first time I had done this, and everything was more complicated than I had imagined, and it was full of variables.
订单哪怕支付成功也会被取消，各种大小挑战和意外层出不穷，而我就需要在原本就很紧张的时间里想出第二种第三种甚至第四种后备解决方案，所以基本上来伦敦的第一周没怎么睡觉。
Orders are cancelled, big and small challenges and surprises come up, and I have to come up with a second third or even a fourth backup solution in an already tight time, so I haven't slept much in the first week in London.
我的朋友们也给我很大的帮助。
My friends also helped me a lot.
我之前在英国的室友看我晚上没时间吃饭就会给我做饭吃；我在英国住在另一个朋友家里，她直接把钥匙给我了，她说你随便住，这是她力所能及、能帮到我的事。
My roommate back in England used to watch me eat when I didn't have time for dinner; I lived at another friend's house in England and she gave me the keys.
大家都在用自己的方式付出。
Everyone is giving in their own way.
Cici在1月26日发的微博“直播是一种互帮互助，也帮我缓解了焦虑”疫情发生之后我虽然一直在捐钱，帮助对接物资，但我还是觉得自己的能力很有限。
Cici's January 26 tweet, "Live broadcasts are a form of mutual help and help ease my anxiety." I've been donating money and helping dock supplies since the outbreak, but I still feel I have limited capacity.
我经常晚上看新闻看到失眠，陷入一种焦虑的情绪之中。
I often watch the news at night to see insomnia, a kind of anxiety in the mood.
后来有一次我晚上发微博，结果发现很多粉丝都和我一样因为疫情的事无法入睡。
Then one night I tweeted and found that many fans just like me couldn't fall asleep because of the epidemic.
我也读到了一些关于武汉人心理疏导的文章，其实这也是一个非常重要的问题。
I also read some articles on the psychological counseling of Wuhan people, in fact this is a very important issue.
我之前学艺术史的时候学过一门“Psychoanalysis and Art”（心理分析与艺术）课程，我自己对心理学也比较感兴趣，觉得在这方面可能可以做点什么，所以我就想到直播陪大家聊天或许是种不错的方式。
I learned a course on "Psychoanalysis and Art" when I was studying art history. I was also interested in psychology and thought there might be something I could do about it, so I thought it might be a good way to talk to you live.
这是我第一次自己主动做直播。
This is the first time I've made a live broadcast myself.
我本来以为直播会特别尴尬，但是实际上大家都非常贴心。
I thought the live broadcast was going to be very awkward, but actually everyone was very close.
直播这件事情并不是我为大家做的事，其实完全是一种互帮互助，直播也帮助我自己缓解了焦虑。
Live broadcast of this matter is not what I do for everyone, in fact, is a total mutual help, live broadcast also helped me ease my anxiety.
我开了直播之后，会发现在那一个小时的时间里，疫情不那么让你不安了，因为大家都在关心你，你也在关心他们，这一个小时还是很快乐的。
After I broadcast it live, I will find that for an hour, the epidemic is less disturbing to you, because everyone cares about you and you care about them, and it was a happy hour.
粉丝会问一些他们想知道的问题：留学经验、我平时看什么书、听什么音乐之类的，感觉挺温馨的。
Fans will ask questions they would like to know: the experience of studying abroad, what kind of books I usually read and what kind of music I listen to.
Yang Yang服装设计师，毕业于伦敦中央圣马丁女装专业，她于2016年创立品牌THE LAWN，她关注服装设计的合理性，善于运用精致版型与考究细节呈现层次感与浪漫气质。
Yang Yang, a clothing designer from St Maarten Central, London, founded THE LAWN in 2016. She is concerned about the rationality of fashion design and is adept at presenting a hierarchy and romantic temperament with sophisticated typography and detail.
通过捕捉人在自然状态下的穿着，还原服装存在的本意。
By capturing people in the natural state of clothing, restore the original meaning of the existence of clothing.
THELAWN20SS“目前我们基本处于一个停滞的状态”一般现在这个时期最重要的工作就是赶样衣，但是现在样衣工在老家没办法过来，所以样衣没有办法做，其他的员工回到上海也需要居家隔离14天。
THELAWN 20SS "At present we are basically in a state of stagnation" The most important thing in this period is to get the sample clothes, but now they can't come back home, so there is no way to do the sample clothes.
虽然之前原定2月10号开工，但实际上也不敢让大家回来，不能拿员工的生命开玩笑。
Although previously scheduled to start on February 10, but in practice did not dare to let everyone back, can not make fun of the lives of staff.
制作方面，店铺在上的2020年春夏我们年前都完成生产了，大部分的店铺已经把货发出去了，但是受疫情的影响有一部分的货款还没有收回来。
On the production side, the shop in the spring and summer of 2020 we finished production, most of the stores have sent out goods, but the impact of the epidemic has not been part of the payment.
新一季的开发，原计划有部分是放在工厂的。
Part of the original plan for the development of the new season was put in the factory.
但是工厂需要大规模的人群在同一个相对密闭的空间里工作，所以现在也是停滞状态。
But factories need large numbers of people to work in the same relatively closed space, so they are now at a standstill.
我们工作室还有比较特殊的一个状况是，这几天我们在搬家。
One of the special things about our studio is that we've been moving these days.
因为找不到搬家工人，小区对人员进出也有管控，所以基本只能自己搬。
Because cannot find the moving worker, the small area also has the control to the person entering and leaving, so basically has to move by oneself.
由于忙着搬工作室，现在也基本没有余力做其他的事情。
With so much work to do in the studio, there is little energy left to do anything else.
THELAWN20SS“订货会延期，买手选货也许会比较保守”虽然我们原本就没有在上海时装周走秀的计划，但是showroom是要参加的。
THELAWN 20SS "Order will be delayed, buy goods may be more conservative" Although we did not have the Shanghai Fashion Week show plan, but Showroom is going to attend.
现在整个时装周延期，我们的showroom具体时间还没定下来，所以现在也无法估计买手们届时的状况。
Now that the fashion week has been postponed and our showroom time hasn't been fixed, it's impossible to estimate what the buyers will be like then.
现在疫情发展的状况一天一个样，谁也没有办法预料到4月份疫情是否已经过去。
As the epidemic continues to unfold day by day, no one can predict whether the April epidemic is over.
线下的订货会其实人流也很密集，如果疫情没有完全结束的话还是比较危险的。
The offline ordering of goods will actually be very crowded, if the epidemic is not completely over or more dangerous.
而且即便到了4月份，疫情已经过去，也不确定会不会因为疫情的影响而让买手订货趋于保守。
And even in April, when the epidemic was over, it was uncertain whether the epidemic would lead to a conservative order from buyers.
现在有非常多的不确定因素，所以我们也只能是猜测到时候的情况。
There is so much uncertainty now that we can only speculate on what will happen.
THELAWN20SS“保证资金链不断裂，这是现阶段最实际的事情”像我们服装行业其实一年就两季，所以很多反应都是滞后的，疫情的影响可能半年之后才会浮现出来。
THELAWN20SS "ensure that the chain of funds does not break, this is the most practical thing at this stage" like our clothing industry in fact two seasons a year, so many responses are lagging, the impact of the epidemic may not emerge for half a year.
其实我本来是非常期待2020年秋冬这一季的，这一季的开发成本甚至比以前还要更高一些。
In fact, I was really looking forward to the autumn and winter of 2020, this season's development costs even higher than before.
设计师们有时候可能会比较任性，不那么关注成本的管控，但是现在也不得不开始严格地控制开销。
Designers may sometimes be wayward and less concerned about cost control, but they now have to start being strict about spending.
保证资金链不断裂，这是现阶段最实际的事情。
It is the most practical thing at this stage to ensure that the chain of funds does not break.
疫情结束之后国内的经济肯定会受到重创，各行各业都会受到影响。
After the epidemic is over, the domestic economy will certainly be hard hit, all walks of life will be affected.
我们这种小的工作室虽然相对来说受的影响较小，但是生存状态也不是特别乐观。
Our small studios, though relatively unaffected, are not particularly sanguine.
我们主线以外还有商业合作线，也是我们非常重视的部分，这些合作实际上是这次疫情中受影响最大的。
Beyond our main lines, there are lines of commercial cooperation, which we attach great importance to, and which are in fact among the most affected by the epidemic.
中型的服装企业其实是最危险的，因为他们有很大的开销，从国家帮补政策中受益又非常有限。
Medium-sized garment companies are in fact the most dangerous because of their high costs and limited benefits from state support policies.
疫情之前中国经济增长就有一点放缓的迹象，服装行业已经明显感觉到不如以前，这次更是一个重创。
Before the outbreak, there were signs of a slowdown in China's economic growth, and the garment industry was clearly feeling worse than it used to be, this time a big hit.
大家都在期待疫情过去之后会不会有一个小的消费爆发期，但是我个人觉得这个爆发期不会太长，毕竟时装不是刚需。
Everyone is looking forward to a small consumption explosion once the epidemic is over, but I personally don't think it will be too long, after all fashion is not just needed.
但也许疫情过后大家会更在意生活的真相与本质，少一点点浮华，变得更实在一些。
But perhaps people will be more concerned with the truth and nature of life after the epidemic, less flashy, more realistic.
Leslie Zhang著名摄影师，凭借其强烈的个人风格和独特的美学标识成为中国年轻一代摄影师中出众的一员。
Leslie Zhang, a well-known photographer, is one of the outstanding photographers among the younger generation of Chinese photographers because of his strong personal style and unique aesthetic mark.
摄影之外的幽默感也让他在社交媒体上收获了大量关注。
His sense of humor outside of photography also earned him a lot of attention on social media.
Leslie Zhang 2019年拍摄作品“我比较乐观，我觉得最多持续到夏天”因为拍摄其实是人员聚集的活动，所以我原定2月份的工作基本上都是取消的状态。
Leslie Zhang 2019's work, "I'm optimistic, I think it will last until summer at most," was largely cancelled because filming was a mass event.
现在不是说大家不愿意出来工作，而是没有办法开工。
This is not to say that people are unwilling to go out to work, but are unable to do so.
很多模特都被迫停工了，有些模特所在的城市或者省份被封了；有些模特现在恰好在国外时装周走秀，他们害怕回国了就出不去了，所以就干脆不回来了。
Many models have been forced to stop work, and some have had their cities or provinces shut down; others are now on foreign fashion shows, afraid to return home, so they simply won't come back.
很多商业拍摄受影响，因为明星不知道什么时候才可以出来工作。
A lot of commercial filming is affected because stars don't know when to get out to work.
本来二月份有情人节，这是一个商业角度上来讲非常重要的时间点，但是因为疫情的影响，线上和线下的投放都会变少，消费者消费意愿降低，大家的关注点就不在这个事情上了，很多商业的拍摄就没有了。
It was meant to be Valentine's Day in February, a very important point in time from a business perspective, but because of the impact of the epidemic, there will be less online and offline delivery and less consumer willingness to spend.
下周其实我还有一个工作，3月刊的杂志没办法开天窗，只能大家在工作的时候注意防护，多开窗通风了。
Next week, I actually have a job, March magazine can not open the skylight, only when we work to pay attention to the protection, more open windows ventilation.
相对来说，对我们摄影的影响是最小的，对设计师或者妆发的影响可能会更大一些。
Relatively speaking, the impact on our photography is minimal, the impact on the designer or makeup may be a little more.
我们现在整个团队规模在6~7个人，因为团队70%~80%的工作内容都是辅助我的工作，所以现在大家都处于停工状态。
We now have a team of 6 to 7 people, because 70% to 80% of the team's work is supporting my work, so now everyone is out of work.
但是大家的情绪都还比较好，偶尔还会去studio照顾一下植物，我们手头也有一些正在聊的下半年的工作。
But everyone was in a better mood, occasionally going to Studio to look after the plants, and we had some work to talk about for the second half of the year.
疫情爆发到现在只有二十几天的时间，但是已经造成了很大的影响。
The outbreak is only a couple of days old, but it has had a huge impact.
如果整个疫情持续超过两个月，那它所造成的影响会特别深远。
If the epidemic continues for more than two months, its impact could be particularly far-reaching.
但我其实也比较乐观，我觉得最多持续到夏天。
But I am also more optimistic and I think it will last until summer at most.
大家撑到夏天还是可以的。
We can hang out till summer.
Leslie Zhang 2019年拍摄作品“没有必要因为疫情考虑改变工作的大方向”如果疫情状况持续下去的话，我可能会去旅行，做一些和时尚无关的创作，沉淀一下。
Leslie Zhang 2019's work "There's no need to change the direction of work because of the epidemic." If the epidemic continues, I might travel and do something unrelated to fashion, settling down.
我今年本来就有出书的计划，如果疫情时间长，恰好时间上有这个空挡的话可能就会去做一些自由创作。
I already have a book plan for this year, if the epidemic is long, the time slot may be to do some creative work.
说实话疫情对经济的影响是很严重的，在疫情时期，时尚行业相对来说不是很重要的行业，大家最关心的是基本的生存刚需：医疗、吃饭、买不买得到口罩等等，所以这段时间里自然会削弱很多对时尚行业的关注，但我觉得这个是不重要的。
To tell the truth, the economic impact of the epidemic is very serious, fashion industry is relatively not very important in the epidemic period, people are most concerned about the basic survival needs: medical care, food, buy not buy masks, etc., so naturally a lot of attention to fashion industry during this period, but I think this is not important.
难道说关注少了，我们作为这个行业的从业者就要减少投入，减少产出吗？没有这个必要。
With less attention, do we, as practitioners in the industry, have to cut back on inputs and output? Not necessarily.
这次疫情虽然影响很大，但肯定不及战争的影响大吧。
Although the impact of the epidemic, but certainly not as much as the impact of the war.
更何况即便是在战争时期，艺术都没有停止过发展。
And even in times of war, art did not cease to develop.
工作方式可能会有所调整，但是没有必要因为疫情就考虑改变工作的大方向。
The modus operandi may be adjusted, but there is no need to consider changing the general direction of work because of the epidemic.
Leslie Zhang 作品《In Bloom》“一个有影响力的社交媒体账号，相当于一本杂志”我在微博上其实非常关注这次疫情，我经常会转发相关的内容，也会在私信里收到一些求助的信息。
"An influential social media account, the equivalent of a magazine," by Leslie Zhang. "I'm actually very concerned about the epidemic on Weibo, and I often forward relevant content and receive help in private letters.
对于我们这种有一定粉丝基础和影响力的人来说应该对疫情多一些关注。
For people like us who have a certain fan base and influence, we should pay more attention to the epidemic.
有些新闻出来的时候可能我们没有办法辨别真伪，这个时候可以保留个人看法；但是看到一些真实的个人求助信息，还是可以帮忙发声的，因为这个行业里很多人是有很高的关注度和影响力的，这些人的社交媒体账号影响力相当于一本杂志，甚至是比一本杂志的影响力还要大，但我却看到这个行业里并没有很多人为疫情发声。
We may not be able to tell the truth from the truth when it comes out, but seeing some real personal information can help, because many people in the industry have a lot of attention and influence, and their social media accounts are as influential as a magazine or even a magazine, but I see not a lot of human voices in the industry.
这其实是一件我们力所能及的事情，又不是让你上前线支援或者是捐钱捐物资，只是让大家知道：有这样的事情正在发生。
It's something we can do, not to get you on the front lines or donate money, just to show that this is happening.
这种时刻是不应该保持沉默的。
Such moments should not be allowed to remain silent.
王琦DEVOLUTION退化建筑合伙人，DEVOLUTION退化建筑是一家致力于提供“建筑、艺术、广告创意”综合方案的“3A公司”。
Wang Qi DEVOTION Degraded Construction Partner DEVOTION Degraded Architecture is a "3A Company" dedicated to providing a comprehensive program of "Architecture, Art, Advertising Creativity."
同时，也尝试将建筑与不同媒介对接，输出城市和建筑观点的开放创作机构，希望用建筑思维和艺术生产的方式，在不同环境中肇事。
At the same time, there are attempts to connect buildings to different media and open creative institutions that export urban and architectural perspectives in the hope that architectural thinking and artistic production will produce results in different environments.
“退化公园”项目，在一个50层高的住宅的27层，租下一套面积约90平方的两室一厅的公寓，将其改造成一个公园“疫情过后，大家倾向于去寻找一些快乐的方式”短期来讲，很多项目会延期，即便设计部分做完了，工人也没办法现场开工，有些测量的工作也没办法做。
The Degraded Park project, which rents a two-bedroom, one-hall apartment of about 90 square feet on 27 floors of a 50-storey house, turns it into a park "After the epidemic, people tend to look for some happy ways." In the short term, many projects will be delayed, even if the design is completed and workers cannot do some measurement work.
一般来讲，我们行业是年后接新案子，但是疫情之后大家的投资意愿会受到比较大的影响。
In general, our industry is a new case after the year, but the epidemic will have a greater impact on the willingness to invest.
但是长期来讲也有乐观的部分，大的社会事件过后大家还是倾向于去寻找一些快乐的方式，消费就是一种方式。
But in the long run there is also optimism that people tend to look for ways to be happy after big social events. Consumption is one way.
疫情期间累计的购物欲和对美好事物的期待，会在疫情过去之后有一个爆发。
The cumulative desire to shop and the expectation of good things during an epidemic can erupt once the epidemic is over.
很多品牌还是有预算的，只是会更加谨慎，他们可能会缩减常规的内容而转去做一些更能见效的事情。
Many brands still have budgets, but will be more cautious, and they may cut back on conventional content and move on to something more effective.
比方说以前有一千块，每个月花一百，现在可能只有五百块，但是会把这五百块集中花在一到两件事上。
For example, there used to be a thousand dollars a month for a hundred dollars, but now it may be only five hundred dollars.
预算吃紧的情况下你希望它是有效的，这会带来对下游行业的淘汰和清洗，建筑设计更是这样。
You want it to be effective under tight budgets, which can lead to the elimination and cleaning of downstream industries, especially in building design.
建筑是房地产的下游行业，很多中国这一代的设计师都是伴随房地产成长起来的。
Construction is the downstream industry of real estate, many Chinese designers of this generation are accompanied by the growth of real estate.
但是现在房地产行业红利期已过，甲方会更谨慎，势必会带来优胜劣汰。
But now that the dividend period in the real estate industry is over, Party A will be more cautious, is bound to bring out the fittest.
互动作品“共享精神塔”“大家宅在家里，对家居生活会有更多的理解和想象”疫情发生之后，我们会增加住宅的项目。
Interactive work "Shared Spiritual Tower" "Everyone will stay at home, there will be more understanding and imagination about home life" After the outbreak of the epidemic, we will increase the number of residential projects.
最近不是有段子吗，说大家宅在家里的时候可以去客厅、去阳台旅游。
Recently there is a paragraph, that we can go to the living room when the house, to the balcony tour.
大家宅在家里，对家居生活会有更多的理解和想象。
Everyone is in the home, will have more understanding and imagination to the home life.
之所以感觉呆在家里无聊是因为家的功能性不够多，大家现在会去考虑这个问题。
The reason why you feel bored at home is that there is not enough functionality in your home, and people are now going to think about it.
当然也不是我们自己就能掌控住宅项目的数量，我们作为乙方一定是被动的，一定是客户来找你，主动的部分在于，你要让客户看到你是谁。
Of course we can not control the number of residential projects, we as Party B must be passive, the customer must come to you, the active part is, you have to let customers see who you are.
像退化建筑之前有一个原生公司雏形，房地产集团类型的客户比例比较高。
Like degraded architecture before there was a prototype of a native company, the real estate group type of customer ratio is relatively high.
这两年我们的客户做了一个层次上的划分，有新的、观念更开放的客户进来。
Over the past two years our customers have made a hierarchical division, with new, more open-minded customers coming in.
我们做了一些商业的、好玩的项目，这些结合我们的看法和幽默感的项目吸引了一些新的客户。
We did some commercial, fun projects that combined our perspective and sense of humor to attract some new customers.
早期我们做这些好玩项目的时候其实没把赚钱当任务，但是客户会因为这样的项目看到更多的可能性。
In the early days when we were doing these fun projects, we didn't actually make money as a task, but customers saw more possibilities for such projects.
室内设计作品“BBC”“控制好人员规模在这种时期就会比较灵活”我们现在团队保持在十个人左右，我们不用养施工的团队，只做设计。
Interior design "BBC" "Controlling the Size of the Personnel" We have a team of about ten people, and we don't have to have a construction team, we just do design.
我们其实更偏“概念所”，所以人员规模可以控制得比较小，在这种时期就会比较灵活。
We are actually more "conceptual", so the size of the staff can be controlled relatively small, in this period will be more flexible.
现在这个行业相对成熟很多，有很专业的链条划分，比如光是深化图纸有一些团队就做得非常好了。
Now this industry is relatively mature, there is a very professional chain division, such as deepening the drawing some teams do very well.
所以我们从两年前开始做人员上的调整，之前最多的时候达到过数十人的规模，当然不是我们提前预知了疫情，而是基于对下行经济形势的判断。
So we started making staffing changes two years ago, at its peak of a few dozen people, not because we predicted the epidemic in advance, but because we judged the economic situation downwards.
✍️- 写在最后的话 -在进行采访之前，我们原本以为大家会花比较长的篇幅陈述这次疫情对自己的工作和生活带来的负面影响，但是所有的受访者都无一例外地在采访中流露出了相当积极的态度。
CHINESE (Reuters) - Before the interview, we thought we would spend a lot of time talking about the negative impact of the epidemic on our work and life, but all the people interviewed showed a very positive attitude.
无论是想方设法调整经营方针，确保自己的团队能够在疫情打击下存活；或是运用自己的个人影响力，为前线捐赠物资、传递求助信息；每个人都在疫情之下给出了自己的应答。
Whether it is to find ways to reorient operations to ensure that their teams survive the epidemic, or to use their personal influence to donate supplies and help messages to the front lines, everyone is responding to the epidemic.
他们对疫情发生之后行业发展趋势的思考和预判也非常具有借鉴意义。
It is also very useful for them to think and predict the trend of industry development after the outbreak.
在这样的时刻，一味焦虑恐慌或是一味盲目乐观都是毫无意义的。
At a time like this, there is no point in panicking or blindly optimistic.
