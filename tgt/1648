近日，中国科学院武汉病毒研究所发表声明：近期网络流传不实信息，称我所毕业生黄燕玲是所谓的最早感染新冠病毒的“零号病人”。
Recently, Wuhan Institute of Virus of the Chinese Academy of Sciences issued a statement: Recently, the network spread false information, said my graduate Huang Yanling is the so-called "new crown virus" of the "zero patients.
经查证，我所郑重声明如下：黄燕玲同学于2015年在我所毕业获得硕士学位，在学期间的研究内容为噬菌体裂解酶的功能及抗菌广谱性，毕业后一直在其他省份工作生活，未曾回过武汉，未曾被2019新型冠状病毒感染，身体健康。
Upon verification, I solemnly declare as follows: In 2015, Miss Huang Yanling received her master's degree from my graduate school. During her studies, she has been working and living in other provinces, has not returned to Wuhan and has not been infected with the new coronavirus 2019.
值此抗疫关键时刻，相关谣言极大干扰了我所的科研攻关工作。
At this critical moment in the fight against the epidemic, related rumors greatly interfered with my research work.
我们保留依法追究法律责任的权利。
We reserve the right to investigate legal responsibility according to law.
衷心感谢社会各界对我所的关心、支持和帮助！谣言已破，问题不止。
I sincerely thank all sectors of the community for their concern, support and help! Rumors have been broken, the problem is not limited.
究竟什么是“零号病人”？“零号病人”为什么重要？又该上哪去找“零号病人”呢？什么是“零号病人”？“零号病人”通常是指第一个患有某种传染病，并开始扩散传播病毒的人。
What is Patient Zero? Why is Patient Zero important? Where should I find Patient Zero? What is Patient Zero? Patient Zero is usually the first person to have an infectious disease and begin to spread the virus.
“零号病人”是一个通俗说法，在流行病调查中，又被叫做“首发病例”“标识病例”。
"Patient Zero" is a colloquial term for what is known in epidemiological investigations as "first cases" or "marker cases."
但这个携带了病毒的人不一定会发病。
But the man with the virus doesn't have to get sick.
因此还有“一号病人”的说法，标记的是第一个出现症状的病人。
So there is the term "patient number one," which refers to the first patient to show symptoms.
“零号病人”和“一号病人”两者并不一定等同，往往还不是同一个人。
Patient Zero and Patient One are not necessarily the same and often not the same person.
但是在他们身上，流行病学家能找到重要的指征意义，为后续的预防和治疗提供指导。
But in them, epidemiologists can find important indications to guide subsequent prevention and treatment.
“零号病人”为什么重要？浙江大学医学院教授金永堂表示，无论是寻找“零号病人”，还是当下开展的流行病学调查，都有助于最快、最准确地确认传染源和传播途径，及时采取有效防控措施，阻止疫情发展。
Whether looking for a "patient zero" or an epidemiological investigation now being conducted, it helps identify the source and route of transmission in the quickest and most accurate way to take timely and effective prevention and control measures to halt the spread of the disease, says Jin Yongtang, a professor at Zhejiang University School of Medicine.
有媒体报道称，通过“零号病人”的细致调查，能够锁定传染源，是否接触了什么动物？锁定传播方式，与动物是如何接触的？了解流行病史，了解到病毒在人体的潜伏期有多长？对血清、疫苗等抑制或治愈性药物的研发起到重要作用。
According to media reports, "patient zero" through careful investigation, can identify the source of infection, contact with any animals? Lock the mode of transmission, how contact with animals? Know the epidemiological history of the virus in the incubation period of the human body? Serum, vaccines and other inhibitors or therapeutic drugs play an important role.
“零号病人”上哪去找？2月17日，军事科学院军事医学研究院微生物流行病研究所研究员曹务春接受记者采访时表示：目前尚未找到“零号病人”，建议重新回到武汉华南海鲜市场溯源病毒。
"No patients have been found," Cao Yuchun, a researcher at the Institute of Microbial Epidemiology at the Academy of Military Sciences, told reporters on Feb. 17.
2月17日，中国疾控中心在《中华流行病学杂志》发布新型冠状病毒肺炎流行病学的特征分析，指出疫情暴发流行时间趋势与先前结论一致，即武汉华南海鲜市场可能有野生动物交易，使得新冠病毒从一种仍然未知的野生动物传染到人类，继而实现人传人。
On February 17, the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced in the Chinese Journal of Epidemiology the epidemiological characteristics of the new coronavirus pneumonia, pointing out that the epidemiological trend of the outbreak is consistent with the previous conclusion that there may be trade in wild animals in the south China seafood market in Wuhan.
对此，专家建议，应尽快组织各单位到武汉华南海鲜市场做系统采样和检测。
To this, expert recommends, should organize each unit to Wuhan South China seafood market to do systematic sampling and testing as soon as possible.
“看到底哪些摊位和病毒有关，再去查这些摊位的进货来源、货物去了哪些餐馆、这些餐馆有哪些人来。
"Look at the stalls that have anything to do with the virus, then look at where they came from, what restaurants they went to and who they came from.
如果相关的人都找到，有可能把‘零号病人’找出来。
If all the people involved are found, it's possible to find Patient Zero.
”曹务春强调。
Cao stressed.
“科研、疾控、临床、动物保护等部门要联合起来。
"The scientific research, disease control, clinical, animal protection and other departments should be united.
”曹务春表示，单靠某一个单位，想把病毒源头搞清楚非常困难。
Cao said it was difficult for a single unit to pinpoint the source of the virus.
找到病毒源头可以打消疑惑，更重要的是可对未来突发传染病疫情的防控积累经验。
Finding the source of the virus can dispel doubts and, more importantly, accumulate experience in the prevention and control of future outbreaks of infectious diseases.
“零号病人”不该被误解从艾滋病到埃博拉，再到SARS，关于“零号病人”的误会一直存在。
"Patient Zero" should not be misunderstood - from AIDS to Ebola to SARS - and there has always been a misunderstanding about "patient zero."
1984年，美国疾病控制与预防中心首次提出了“零号病人”的概念。
In 1984, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first introduced the concept of "patient zero."
当时美国疾控中心认为经常在空中飞行的法裔加拿大航班乘务员盖特恩·杜加斯是艾滋病从非洲传入北美洲的零号感染源。
At the time, the CDC believed that French-Canadian flight attendant Gettin Dugas, who often flew in the air, was the zero source of AIDS from Africa to North America.
该案例被收录到一名新闻记者出版的书籍《世纪的哭泣》里。
The case was included in the book Crying in the Century, published by a journalist.
该书的作者形容杜加斯具有反社会的行为，故意散播身上的艾滋病病毒，危害他的性伴侣。
The book's author describes Dugas as antisocial, deliberately spreading the AIDS virus on his body and harming his sexual partner.
在报纸的头版头条里，杜加斯还成为了“那个把艾滋带到我们身边的男人”。
On the front page of the paper, Dagas was also "the man who brought AIDS to us."
一个流行病学上的术语，在人们的误传和偏见中成为了受尽指责的标签。
An epidemiological term that has been labeled as reprehensible in the face of misinformation and prejudice.
2003年，首例SARS患者的报告病例是在深圳一家餐馆做厨师的36岁河源人黄杏初，他早在2002年12月15日就出现了病症。
The first reported case of SARS in 2003 was Huang Xingchu, a 36-year-old cook at a Shenzhen restaurant who developed symptoms as early as December 15, 2002.
治愈出院后，通过新闻报道，他才知道自己原来是那个“首例”。
After he was cured and discharged from hospital, he knew he was the "first case" through news reports.
这个“第一”，给他带来了各种压力，他换了五六张电话卡，上街的时候会戴上帽子，这种状态的日子，他形容自己活得很像一个逃犯。
This "first" brought him all sorts of pressure, he changed five or six phone cards, would wear a hat on the street, this state of affairs, he described himself as living like a fugitive.
但是，黄杏初并非“零号病人”，SARS的首例病例在2002年的11月16日已经出现。
But Huang Xingchu was not "patient zero" and the first case of SARS occurred on Nov. 16, 2002.
事实上，“零号病人”很难一锤定音，远不是研究的终点，“零号”后还可能会有新的“零号”发现，其确认过程本身就是对病毒发展情况的复盘与再认知。
In fact, patient number zero is hard to pin down, far from the end of the study, and a new "Zero" discovery is likely to follow. The confirmation process itself is a reconfirmation of the virus's development.
寻找“零号病人”的过程是针对病毒而非人，在尊重科学规律的前提下，事实才会慢慢呈现。
The process of finding "patient zero" is aimed at viruses, not people, and it takes respect for the laws of science for facts to emerge.
