这次新型冠状病毒的爆发暴露出，从某些角度看似乎很强大的美国经济，实际上存在严重缺陷，结构不健全，亟需改革文 | 珍妮尔·琼斯编辑 | 王天倪有时候，人们只需要一道闪电，就能看到一棵看似健康的树已经从内部开始腐烂。
The outbreak of this new coronavirus has revealed that, in some respects, the seemingly powerful US economy is seriously flawed and structurally unsound, and urgently in need of reform. & # 160; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45
而这次新型冠状病毒就暴露出，从某些角度看似乎很强大的美国经济，实际上存在严重缺陷，结构不健全，亟需改革。
The new coronavirus has revealed that the US economy, which in some ways appears to be strong, is seriously flawed, structurally weak and in urgent need of reform.
尽管未来几周的重点应该是人们的健康，但面对冠状病毒危机暴露出的美国经济中根深蒂固的问题，在没有经过诚恳讨论之前，政策制定者不应该让这一时刻过去。
While the focus in the coming weeks should be on people's health, policymakers should not let this moment pass without serious discussion of the deep-seated problems in the US economy revealed by the coronavirus crisis.
在过去的十年中，股票市场已经攀升到历史新高；失业率创历史新低；公司财报显示了创纪录的利润。
Over the past decade, stock markets have climbed to all-time highs; unemployment has hit a record low; and corporate earnings have shown record profits.
但在这个看似健康的外表背后，腐败正在蔓延。
But behind this seemingly healthy appearance, corruption is spreading.
越来越多的国家财富被那些有钱有势的人攫取，他们利用自己的金钱和权力来确保这个体系继续为他们服务。
More and more national wealth is being seized by the rich and powerful, who use their money and power to ensure that the system continues to serve them.
与此同时，住房、医疗保健、儿童保育和高等教育的成本迅速上升，而绝大多数人的工资却停滞不前。
At the same time, the costs of housing, health care, childcare and higher education have risen rapidly, while the wages of the vast majority have stagnated.
种族和性别的工资和财富差距持续存在，在某些情况下甚至变得更加严重。
The wage and wealth gap between race and gender persists and in some cases becomes even more acute.
特殊利益集团成功地推动了一项放松监管的议程，将风险从企业转移到纳税人身上，并推动了一项反劳工的议程，将权力交到大型企业手中，让广大职工自谋生路。
Special interest groups have succeeded in pushing a deregulatory agenda, shifting risk away from businesses to taxpayers, and pushing an anti-labor agenda that places power in the hands of large corporations, leaving workers to fend for themselves.
递减税收政策和目光短浅的预算决议导致数万亿美元流入富人的口袋，而对国家未来的投资以及那些最需要钱的人，却被掏空了。
Declining tax policies and short-sighted budget resolutions have resulted in trillions of dollars flowing into the pockets of the rich, while investments in the country's future and those who need it most have been hollowed out.
许多进步人士多年来一直在谈论这种腐败。
Many progressives have been talking about this corruption for years.
对于数百万正在挣扎的人来说，这个现实就是他们每天的生活。
For the millions who are struggling, this reality is their daily life.
但是，直到全球性公共卫生危机爆发的可能性增加，股市暴跌，美国经济的光鲜外表所掩盖的问题才开始得到更多的关注。
But it was not until the possibility of a global public-health crisis rose, the stock market plummeted, and the glitter of the US economy began to take center stage.
政策制定者在加大应对这种冠状病毒力度的同时，也需要承认保守和紧缩政策的存在，这些政策使得政府缺乏应对广泛传播的公共卫生危机的能力，并使经济在即将到来的衰退中变得更脆弱。
As policymakers scale up their response to this coronavirus, they also need to acknowledge the existence of conservative and austerity policies that leave governments ill-equipped to respond to the widespread public-health crisis and make the economy more vulnerable in the coming recession.
美国是两个不保证带薪病假的工业化国家之一。
The United States is one of two industrialized countries that do not guarantee paid sick leave.
即使在经济最好的时候，数以百万计的职工也不得不在留在家里养病和领取他们迫切需要的薪水之间做出选择。
Even in the best of times, millions of workers have to choose between staying home to stay sick and getting the salaries they desperately need.
低收入人群最不可能享受带薪病假，而他们又通常会从事与公众接触的职业：幼儿教师、家庭保健助理、餐馆工作人员和食品加工者。
Low-income people are the least likely to be on paid sick leave, and they are often found in occupations that come into contact with the public: nursery teachers, family health assistants, restaurant workers and food processors.
但随着这种冠状病毒的传播，太多的在职员工将被迫在为一日三餐奔波还是照顾自己或家庭成员之间做出选择——这将使任何疫情的爆发变得更加糟糕。
But with the spread of this coronavirus, too many working staff will be forced to choose between running around for three meals a day or taking care of themselves or their family members - making any outbreak worse.
同样，数以百万计的人没有医疗保险。
Similarly, millions of people do not have health insurance.
另外还有数百万人没有足够的保险，他们负担不起生病时必须自掏腰包支付的部分和免赔额。
Millions more do not have adequate insurance and cannot afford out-of-pocket payments and deductibles in the event of illness.
人们被迫自掏腰包支付数千美元用于冠状病毒的治疗和检测的事情已经在发生了。
It is already happening that people are being forced to pay thousands of dollars out of their own pocket for treatment and testing for coronavirus.
在正常情况下，没有医保或者医保不足的状况对家庭来说已经很惨痛了，但是当人们因为负担不起而推迟对冠状病毒的治疗或检测时，对家庭的打击将会更加严重，甚至致命。
In normal times, the lack of or inadequate health care for the family is devastating, but when people can't afford to delay treatment or testing for the coronavirus, the impact on the family will be even more severe, if not fatal.
这是低收入社区、农村地区和有色人种社区特别关注和担心的问题，而他们已经在获得医疗护理方面面临重大的系统性挑战了。
This is a particular concern and concern for low-income communities, rural areas and communities of colour, who already face significant systemic challenges in accessing health care.
如果疫情进一步恶化，联邦预算决策的现实将使全国人民深受打击。
If the epidemic worsens, the reality of federal budget decisions will hit the nation hard.
即使是所谓的“赤字鹰派”也可能加入到呼吁增加对公共卫生、相关研发和其他冠状病毒相关支出的行列。
Even the so-called "deficit hawks" could join the call for increased spending on public health, related research and development, and other coronavirus-related expenditures.
但是，在公共卫生支出方面的真实情况也体现在整个联邦预算中：数十年来，在基础设施、教育和培训、社会福利住房和其他方面的投入一直资金不足，并被掏空。
But the truth about public-health spending is also reflected throughout the federal budget: for decades, investment in infrastructure, education and training, social housing, and others has been underfunded and hollowed out.
也许冠状病毒的结果会比许多人担心的要好。
Perhaps the coronavirus will turn out better than many people feared.
希望如此。
I hope so.
即使这样，不用很长时间，也会有别的事情发生，劈开这棵腐烂的树。
Even then, it won't be long before something else will happen, splitting the rotten tree.
一个健康的经济体系是每个人都有经济保障，安全的网络、支持和保护，以确保他们能够做出对自己、对家庭、对社区正确的决定。
A healthy economic system is one in which everyone has economic security, a secure network, support and protection to ensure that they can make the right decisions for themselves, for their families and for their communities.
一个强大的经济体是人人都繁荣发展，财富和权力不会只流向那些能够操纵这个体系使其受益的人。
A strong economy is one in which everyone thrives, and wealth and power do not flow only to those who can manipulate the system for their benefit.
只有明智的联邦投入、有效的联邦政府以及共享和公平的繁荣才能提供这样坚实的基础。
Only a sensible federal commitment, an effective federal government, and shared and equitable prosperity can provide such a solid foundation.
对于大多数美国人经济现实的全国性讨论，不应该是由一场公共健康危机而被迫引发的。
National discussion of the economic realities of most Americans should not be forced by a public-health crisis.
不幸的是，这个国家不能让这场危机在不面对这一问题的情况下过去。
Unfortunately, the country cannot allow this crisis to pass without confronting it.
