曾有人出过这样一个主意，在每次输入个人信息时，加入一个可反追踪的代码，比如在某宝下单，就把名字输为王某宝，某团、某东亦然，这样便能知道是哪里走漏了风声。
It has been suggested that each time personal information is entered, a counter-traceable code is added, such as placing an order with a treasure, and a name is lost to Wang, as well as a regiment or something, so that one knows where the wind leaks.
不得不由现象反推路径，是出于对系统的不信任。
Having to push back the path of phenomena is due to distrust of the system.
每一次面部识别，每一次指纹采集，每一次输入：姓名、身份证号、电话、邮箱、住址、性别、年龄……它们会被集结到哪里，进入什么系统，被谁看见，被谁使用，如何使用。
Every face recognition, every fingerprint collection, every entry: name, identity number, phone number, mailbox, address, gender, age... where they will be assembled, what systems they will enter, who will see them, who will use them and how they will use them.
这样的采集愈发无孔不入，但鲜少有人觉得，需要出来向被采集者解释一些什么。
Such collections are becoming more pervasive, but few people feel the need to come out and explain something to the interviewee.
在疫情期间，出于防止疫情扩散、精准控制带病毒人群的目的，收集人的数据似乎有了更多理由，之前的数据积累也到了使用的时候。
There seems to be more reason to collect data on people during the epidemic for the purpose of preventing the spread of the disease and accurately controlling the population living with the virus, and the time has come to use the previous data accumulation.
人与技术的关系出现一些变化：一方面，人们开始面对更多被采集的时刻；另外，此前面对自己信息被收集时发出的审视、思考、质问，也于此时更集中地出现。
The relationship between man and technology has changed: on the one hand, people are beginning to see more of the time they are being gathered; on the other hand, the scrutiny, thinking and questioning that came before them in the face of the collection of their own information have become more intense.
在一片不透明的庞大面前，也许只有通过无数个人的体验，才能拼贴出它隐约的形状。
In the face of a vast opacity, perhaps only through a myriad of personal experience, it is possible to collage its faint shape.
每一个猜测都把我们更推近其真实的面貌。
Every guess brings us closer to its true face.
这个隐约的形状是在经历的累积中不断清晰的。
This indistinct shape is continually apparent in the accumulation of experience.
它可能让你意识到：泄露严重、定位精准，令人胆寒；或是不那么严重，甚至本以为它应该被使用的时候，并没有及时到位，或者充满错漏……技术不受管辖的先进和出人意料的落后同时存在，二者交替进行，充满不确定。
It can make you realize that leaks are serious, location-specific, chilling, or not so serious that even when you thought it should have been used, it wasn't there in time, or it was full of errors and omissions... Technology goes hand in hand with advanced and unexpected backwardness, alternating with uncertainty.
当然，你也可能对此不支持也不反对，仅仅是在接触的过程中，对所谓“大数据”系统的认知增加了。
Of course, you might not support it or object to it. Just in the process of engagement, awareness of so-called "big data" systems has increased.
