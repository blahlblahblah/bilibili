林红军留在小卖部门口的椅子作者：李强编辑：张国鄱阳街18号的商店，拉下了蓝色卷帘门。
Author: Li Qiang, editor: The shop at 18 Poyang Street, Zhang Guo.pulled down the blue curl door.
在起于武汉的新冠肺炎疫情里，这家位于武汉市中心医院南京路院区后门附近的副食商店失去了老板，老板娘也进了医院。
The grocery store near the back door of Wuhan's central hospital, Nanjing Road, lost its owner and the landlady was admitted to the hospital.
在武汉市中心医院疼痛科主任蔡毅一篇引人关注的悼文里，店主的名字是“林君”。
In a remarkable eulogy by Cai Yi, director of the pain department at Wuhan Central Hospital, the owner's name was "Lin Jun."
这也是他的微信昵称。
That's his nickname, too.
其实，他叫林红军，一个被所有受访者公认的普通人。
In fact, his name is the Red Army Lin, a common person recognized by all the interviewees.
他感染后迟迟找不到床位，家属为他发布过一次求助信息，被淹没在逾20亿阅读量的“肺炎患者求助”微博超话里。
After his infection, he was unable to find a bed, and his family sent him a call for help, submerged in the tweets of more than two billion "pneumonia sufferers."
他去世后，医生蔡毅发出的纪念他的微博，有几十万人转发、评论、点赞。
After his death, doctor Cai Yi sent out a microblog commemorating him, which was forwarded, commented and praised by hundreds of thousands of people.
林红军是1月23日那天开始发烧的，去医院最初的诊断是普通发烧。
The Red Army had a fever on January 23, and the initial diagnosis of going to the hospital was a common fever.
“医院就给他打了一针，让他回去了，说在医院里怕交叉感染，回去自己隔离就好了。
"The hospital gave him an injection and told him to go back. He said he was afraid of cross-infection in the hospital.
”林红军的一位家属说，那段日子里林红军回到他的副食商店，把自己关了起来。
A member of the Reds' family said the Reds went back to his grocery store and locked themselves up.
春节前，他还特意打电话提醒家属注意防护。
Before the Spring Festival, he also made a special call to remind his family of protection.
1月20日，国家卫生健康委高级别专家组介绍，这种肺炎存在“人传人”的现象。
The pneumonia has a human-to-human component, a high-level panel of experts from the National Health Council said on January 20.
同在鄱阳街开商店的胡正荣（化名）最近见到的，只是他每天来送饭的妻子。
Hu Zhengrong (not his real name), who also runs a store on Poyang Street, recently met only his wife, who comes to deliver food every day.
“一个人在里面睡着。
"A man sleeps in it.
”胡正荣告诉记者，他也是从林妻那里得知林红军感染。
"Hu Zhengrong told reporters he also learned from Lin's wife that the Red Army had been infected.
1月31日早上，前去送饭的妻子发现林红军昏迷，呼吸困难，但120派不出车，只好去商店对面的医院急诊求助。
On the morning of January 31, his wife, who had gone to bring food, found the Red Army unconscious and breathless, but the 120-member team could not get out and went to the hospital across the street from the hospital for help.
“急诊室拿轮椅过来拖过去的，他走不动了。
"The emergency room was wheeled over and he couldn't walk.
”胡正荣说。
'he said.
肺部CT诊断报告单显示：这个49岁的男人，临床诊断为呼吸道感染、肺部感染，双肺可见弥漫磨玻璃片状模糊影，双肺多发斑片状感染病灶，双侧胸腔少量积液。
The 49-year-old man was clinically diagnosed with respiratory tract infections, lung infections, diffuse grind-glass blurring of the lungs, multiple pulmonary plaque infection, and a small amount of bilateral pleural effusion in the 49-year-old man, according to a lung CT report.
一位重症科医生看过片子后判断病情比较重，需要密切监护，有可能需要气管插管，插管了尽可能住进重症监护病房。
An intensive care physician who had seen the film judged it to be serious, required close supervision, and probably needed a trachea intubation, which was inserted as far as possible into the intensive care unit.
从那时起，漫长的等待就开始了。
Since then, the long wait has begun.
妻子在医院陪他，亲戚每天把饭送到医院门口。
His wife was with him in the hospital and his relatives took the food to the hospital entrance every day.
家人先去社区排队，等待住进定点医院。
Families line up in the community and wait to be admitted to the designated hospital.
林红军的家属告诉记者，从1月31日起，林红军一直躺在南京路院区里临时设置的病床上。
The Red Army has been lying in a makeshift hospital bed in the Nanjing Road compound since January 31, family members told reporters.
那时，这里并非新冠肺炎患者救治的定点医院。
At the time, it was not a designated hospital for patients with Newcastle Pneumonia.
2月2日，医生口头告知了家属核酸检测结果：阳性。
On 2 February, the doctor orally informed the family of the nucleic acid test results: positive.
家人四处求助，给卫健委、市长热线、区疫情防控指挥部、社区打电话，希望帮忙联系住院，也有志愿者联系他们，但很多天都没有进展。
The family went around asking for help, phoning the health committee, the mayor's hotline, the district epidemic prevention and control command, the community, hoping to help contact the hospital, or volunteers to contact them, but for many days there was no progress.
从2月1日起，医院开具的门诊病历上，连续8天“告病危”。
From February 1, out-patient medical records issued by the hospital, eight consecutive days of "critical illness."
2月7日的门诊病历上写着：“患者目前重症病毒性肺炎，需要住院治疗，但请相关科室会诊，均表示暂无床位，暂于我院留观室就诊。
"The patient is suffering from severe viral pneumonia, which requires hospitalization, but requests for consultation with the relevant department indicate that there are no beds available," he wrote in the February 7 outpatient medical record.
今日继续告病危。
Today we continue to be critically ill.
”回忆起这些，那位家属声音低沉下来：“最后找到床位了，但是他情况太危重了，刚转院过去就……”2月9日早上，武汉市中心医院后湖院区给林红军的妻子打来电话说“有一个床位给他”时，林红军已确诊第九天，这是他生命中的最后一天，同样在等待中度过。
Remembering this, the family's voice sank into a low voice: "At last he found his bed, but his condition was too serious to be transferred to hospital..." On the morning of February 9, when the wife of the Red Army called and said, "There is a bed for him," Lin Red Army was diagnosed nine days ago, the last day of his life.
疫情来得太急，而排队者太多。
The epidemic is coming too fast and there are too many queues.
家属一直在试图联系120急救车，志愿者也在帮忙，希望尽快把他送去。
The family has been trying to contact the 120 ambulance, volunteers are also helping, hoping to send him as soon as possible.
当晚7点多，120急救车来了。
More than 7: 00 p. m. that night, 120.
林红军直接被送入抢救室，医生让家属在外面等，等来的是死亡通知单。
The Red Army was taken directly to the rescue room. The doctor told the family to wait outside.
一位认识林红军20多年的朋友，最后一次见他是在1月21日左右。
A friend who has known the Reds for more than 20 years was last seen on or about January 21.
她记得从林红军门口路过的时候，看到他戴着两层口罩。
She remembers walking past the Red Army gate and seeing him wearing a two-storey mask.
她得知林红军去世的消息则是在微博上，看到了蔡毅医生的悼文。
She learned that the news of the death of the Red Army was on Weibo and saw the eulogy of Dr. Cai Yi.
医生蔡毅是在林红军去世两天之后才知道“林君”走了。
Doctor Cai Yi was in the Red Army died two days later only to know that "Lin Jun" left.
他想起来，不久之前医院麻醉科老主任打电话说了“林君”的病情，问他有没有床，被他婉拒。
He remembered, not long ago hospital anaesthesiology department old director called said "Lin Jun" the illness, asked him to have a bed, he declined.
“这次疫情，老主任知道我难做，这是他第一次为要床位向我开口，我当时实在没床位了。
"The old director knew I would have a hard time doing it. It was the first time he had asked me for a bed.
”蔡毅本以为年轻的林红军能够扛过去，但没想到两天之后，“走在我们医院急诊留观室，双肺，全白。
"Cai thought the young Reds could carry it, but two days later," walked in our hospital emergency room, both lungs, all white.
”蔡毅打过电话去问急诊留观室的同事，“他们说也没办法，发展太快了，除非有ECMO（人工膜肺），也许才有一线生机。
"They can't help it," Cai Yi called colleagues in the emergency room. "It's growing too fast, perhaps with an ECMO," he said.
”但是在武汉市中心医院，加上“化缘”来的一台，全院也只有两台ECMO。
But there are only two ECMO's in Wuhan central hospital, plus one from Huiyuan.
“李文亮（医生）走了，同济医院林正斌（医生）走了，全国皆知，一个小卖部老板走了……谁又知道？”在悼文里蔡毅写道：“我们都是小人物，在这场疫情的洗礼下，默默地付出，默默地承受着生离死别。
"Li Wenliang (doctor) has gone, Tongji hospital Lin Zhengbin (doctor) has gone, the whole country knows, a commissary owner has left... Who knows?" Cai Yi wrote in the eulogy: "We are all small people, quietly pay under the baptism of this epidemic, silently bearing the parting."
”他感谢了这位总是给大家送货、而多数人并不熟悉的店主。
"He thanked the owner, who was always delivering goods and most people weren't familiar with him.
“很多这样的小人物，在我们身边，不那么起眼，突然，没了，我们才发现，他在我们生命中，是那么重要。
"A lot of these little people, around us, don't look so good, all of a sudden, we don't realize how important he is in our lives.
”医院一位工作7年的护士甚至不知道自己是否去过他的小卖店。
A seven-year-old nurse at the hospital did not even know whether she had been to his store.
直到看过小卖店的照片，她才意识到，那是鄱阳街上自己最常去的一家，但她去的时候，见到的大多是林红军温和的妻子。
It was not until she had seen the pictures of the shop that she realized that it was the one she visited most often on Poyang Street, but when she went there, she met mostly the gentle wife of the Red Army.
林红军去世后，一两天内，他妻子也确诊了，2月12日住进了医院，所幸入院比较及时，病情稳定。
After the death of the Reds, his wife was diagnosed within a day or two, and was admitted to hospital on February 12. Fortunately, he was hospitalized in a timely and stable condition.
他的事情，家属一直瞒着他年迈的父母。
His family kept his old parents in the dark about him.
家属默默删掉了互联网上关于他的那条求助信息。
The family silently deleted the help message about him from the Internet.
这位护士能够说出小卖店进门位置是矿泉水，最左边是面包、糕点、巧克力，中间是卫生纸、牙刷、卫生巾等生活用品，以及各种饮料。
The nurse was able to name the store's entry point as mineral water, with bread, pastries, chocolates on the far left, toilet paper, toothbrushes, sanitary towels in the middle, and drinks of all kinds.
但她说，不记得最后一次见林红军是什么时候，印象里每次见到的总是一个笑眯眯的男人，扛着东西送到科室，然后匆匆离去。
But she said she did not remember the last time she saw the Red Army, the impression is always a smiling man, carrying things to the department, and then hurried away.
多年以来，她并未太在意这样一个人的存在，只是值夜班时，肚子饿了就会走进林红军的小卖店，买点儿面包和饮料。
For many years, she did not pay much attention to the existence of such a person, only on night work, hungry will go into the Red Army shop, buy some bread and drink.
胡正荣也是从网上得知林红军去世了。
Hu Zhengrong also learned from the Internet that the Red Army has died.
他和林红军在这条街共存了至少20年，虽然是同业竞争，但没闹过矛盾。
He and the Reds have lived side by side in this street for at least 20 years and, although in competition with each other, have not been at loggerheads.
鄱阳街没什么大的变化，他们日子也乏善可陈。
There is no great change in Poyang Street, nor are they doing very well.
每天就是奔波，进货，卖货，送货，其余的时间，看店，吃饭，睡觉。
Everyday is running, buying, selling, shipping, the rest of the time, watching shops, eating, sleeping.
“很乏味的，平凡的人就做平凡的事情，老百姓就是这种生活。
"Very boring, ordinary people do ordinary things, the common people is this kind of life.
”他知道林红军一直住不上院，但也帮不上什么忙：“现在有100张床位，有1000个人要住，你说怎么办？”“如果不是这么密集的接触，他老婆也不会感染的。
He knew that the Reds had not been able to live in the upper house, but he could not help: "Now there are 100 beds and 1,000 people to live in, what do you say?
”戴着口罩，站在小卖店里，胡正荣说：“总要有个人照顾他，明摆着会被感染，但是没得选择。
Standing in the shop wearing a mask, Hu said: "Someone must take care of him. Obviously he will get infected, but he has no choice.
”胡正荣仍把小卖店开着，虽然新冠肺炎疫情依然在武汉肆虐，但他没有其他选择：“我们必须拿时间来换收入。
Mr. Hu still keeps the store open, and while the outbreak of pneumonia is still raging in Wuhan, he has no other choice: "We must take time to earn it.
开门起码家里还透气一些。
Open the door at least some air in the house.
”他从郊县搬到武汉20多年，一家人就住在小卖店后身，“这就是我的家，有厨房、厕所和床”。
When he moved from suburban areas to Wuhan for more than 20 years, the family lived in the back of the store.
林红军也一样，小卖店后身有厨房、厕所和床，他的全部生活。
So did the Red Army, which had a kitchen, a toilet and a bed behind it, his whole life.
在如今的鄱阳街18号，紧闭的蓝色卷帘门前，仍然摆着一张木色的靠椅。
At what is now 18 Poyang Street, a wooden chair still stands in front of the closed blue curly door.
那是林红军平时放在门前的，供走累的过路者休息。
It was laid in front of the door by the Red Army for tired passers-by to rest.
就在春节之前，这条街上的商店招牌还统一更新过。
Just before the Spring Festival, shop signs on this street were also updated.
林红军的店名里有他孩子的名字。
The name of the Red Army's shop has his child's name.
新招牌已经挂了上去。
The new sign has been put up.
