____很多病人病情发展出乎意料，周新表示，虽然救治压力很大，但上海医疗队会继续坚持，力争降低病死率。
Many patients develop unexpectedly. Zhou Xin said the Shanghai medical team will continue to insist on reducing the fatality rate despite the pressure of medical treatment.
____记者 | 周　洁除夕夜，66岁的上海市第一人民医院呼吸与危重症医学科学科带头人周新教授，主动请缨参加第一批上海援鄂医疗队，担任医师组组长。
On New Year's Eve, 66, Professor Zhou Xin, head of respiratory and critical medical science at Shanghai's First People's Hospital, volunteered to take part in the first batch of medical teams in Shanghai as a team leader.
在此前抗击SARS和甲型H1N1流感的战斗中，周新教授都未曾缺席。
Professor Chow has not been absent from previous battles against SARS and H1N1.
抗击甲流期间，周新教授还成功率领团队实现了国内首例重症甲流患者救治成功的案例，在全国产生了广泛影响。
During the fight against A-flow, Professor Zhou Xin also successfully led the team to realize the first successful case of severe influenza A in China, which had a wide-ranging impact on the whole country.
武汉金银潭医院，周新教授就是上海医疗队一线医护人员的主心骨。
Professor Zhou Xin is the mainstay of the front-line medical staff of Shanghai Medical Team.
他不仅负责制定患者治疗方案，还总是身先士卒，抢着做最危险的危重病患插管操作。
He is responsible not only for patient care programs, but also for leading the way in performing the most dangerous and dangerous cases of critical intubation.
武汉金银潭医院截至2月14日已经有14人康复出院，还有一些重症患者病情正在逐步好转。
As of February 14, 14 people had been discharged from Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital.
随着武汉“应收尽收”策略的推进，武汉金银潭医院重症病患收治量开始增加。
With the promotion of Wuhan "receivable from all" strategy, Wuhan gold and silver pool hospital admission of serious patients began to increase.
2月12日，《新民周刊》连线周新主任，他表示，虽然救治压力很大，但上海医疗队会继续坚持，力争降低病死率。
On Feb. 12, Xinmin Weekly wired Zhou Xinxin, who said the Shanghai medical team would continue to insist on reducing the fatality rate despite the pressure of medical treatment.
病毒还会侵犯其他器官救治危重症患者挑战不小《新民周刊》：上海医疗队管理的重症病人情况怎么样？治疗上是否累积了一些经验？周新：目前我们救治的病人里，已经有14名出院病例，也有不少重症病人病情减轻，转到了普通病房。
The virus will also invade other organs to treat critically ill patients Not small NEWSWEEK: What is the situation of the seriously ill patients managed by the Shanghai Medical Corps? Has some experience accumulated in the treatment? Zhou Xin: At present, 14 patients have been discharged from the hospital and many of them have been relieved and transferred to the general ward.
新冠肺炎是一种自限性疾病，也就是说病情发展到一定程度，能够逐渐恢复痊愈。
Coronary pneumonia is a self-limited disease, that is, the disease to a certain extent, can gradually recover.
所以大部分的轻症病人，如果不往重症的方向发展，那么只要隔离并对症治疗两个星期，核酸检测连续两次阴性就可视为痊愈。
So if most light patients do not go in the direction of serious illness, as long as isolation and symptomatic treatment for two weeks, nucleic acid testing two consecutive negative can be regarded as healing.
就像感冒了，通过病人自己的免疫功能，抵抗力好就扛过去了。
Like a cold, through the patient's own immune function, good resistance to carry over.
我们治疗的危重病人中，既有老年人，也有年轻人，以前讲有基础疾病的病人容易危重，现在看来也不尽然，我们病房里30多岁、40多岁的年轻人，没有基础疾病的也有。
We treat both the elderly and the young among the critically ill, and it does not seem to be the case that patients who used to talk about basic diseases are vulnerable, and there are young people in our wards in their 30s and 40s, without basic illnesses.
但是老年人一旦病危呢，死亡率确实会高一些，因为肺炎再加上原来的高血压、糖尿病等等，更加不好治。
But when the elderly are dying, the death rate is higher, because pneumonia, combined with high blood pressure, diabetes and so on, is more difficult to treat.
目前，对于这个疾病是如何发展的，其中的规律我们还搞不清，很多病人病情发展是出乎我们的意料。
At present, we do not know how the disease developed, the laws of which we do not know, many patients are the development of the disease than we expected.
与SARS和禽流感的病人相比，就我的个人经验来说，新冠肺炎重症的患者救治难度更加大一些，因为它除了攻击病人的肺之外，还会侵犯其他器官。
Compared to SARS and Avian Flu patients, in my personal experience, the treatment of patients with severe coronary pneumonia is more difficult, as it attacks not only the lungs of the patient, but also other organs.
举个例子，我们在治疗一个病人的时候，本来他的氧饱和度和状态都非常好，我们下班走的时候人看上去蛮好的，人也清醒的。
For example, when we treat a patient, his oxygen saturation and state are very good, we leave work when people look good, also sober.
结果，第二天一交班，说这个病人晚上突然去世了，原因是这个病毒在侵犯病人肺的同时，也影响到了心肌。
As a result, the next day, on shift, the patient died suddenly at night because the virus affected the heart as well as the lungs.
通俗地说，病人是因为病毒性心肌炎去世的。
In layman's terms, the patient died of viral myocarditis.
目前，在危重症病人的治疗上，我们也还没有发现特效药。
At present, in the treatment of critically ill patients, we have not found specific drugs.
现在网上讨论的几种治疗药物，暂时也说不清是否有疗效，还需要进行进一步的临床实验，包括前段时间大家很关心的瑞德西韦，目前还在临床试验中，疗效无从谈起，还需要实验结束才能有结论。
Several of the treatments currently being discussed on the Internet are not yet sure whether they are effective, and further clinical trials are needed, including Rhetsevir, which has long been a concern, and are currently in clinical trials, where the results are far from conclusive.
康复者血浆中含有针对新冠病毒的抗体，输入病人体内是一种方法，从理论上讲是有效的，但是这一方法目前尚没有开展较大规模的临床研究。
The plasma of convalescent patients contains antibodies against the new crown virus. Input to the patient is a method that is theoretically effective but has not been studied on a larger scale.
目前来看，如果危重病人一旦需要抢救，真的是比较棘手，我们的经验是使用无创或有创呼吸机治疗的危重患者总体病死率还比较高。
At present, if the critically ill need to be rescued, is really more difficult, our experience is the use of non-invasive or invasive breathing machine treatment of critical patients overall mortality rate is relatively high.
出院病人目前没有发现二次感染《新民周刊》：新冠肺炎的传染特征，现在我们已经有一些了解了吗？周新：这个传染病的传播途径，目前我们也还在调查中。
At present, no secondary infection has been found in patients discharged from the hospital. Do we know something about the infection characteristics of Newcomer Pneumonia? Zhou Xin: The spread of the disease is still under investigation.
我们发现，即使和确诊患者密切接触，也不是每个人都会得病，这个不是绝对的。
We found that even when in close contact with diagnosed patients, not everyone gets sick, and this is not absolute.
另外，就是这个病小孩得病的确实比较少，在整个确诊病人的规模里，数量不多，但原因是多方面的，现在讲不清。
In addition, it is this child who is really less ill, in the overall size of the diagnosed patients, the number is not large, but the reasons are manifold, and now unclear.
SARS、禽流感，或者说常见的流感，小孩和成人的发病率是差不多的，那么是不是小孩身上会有一种抗体能够对抗这个病毒，目前还不清楚。
SARS, avian flu, or common flu, have similar rates in children and adults, and it's unclear if a child will have an antibody to fight the virus.
《新民周刊》：我们现在的出院标准是什么？出院病人会不会有二次感染的风险？周新：目前我们的出院标准是国家标准。
What are our discharge standards now? Are patients discharged from hospital at risk of secondary infection? Zhou Xinxin: At present, our discharge standard is the national standard.
首先是病人没有症状，第二是影像学上肺部病灶明显吸收，第三是核酸检测两次阴性，两次检测要中间间隔一天。
The first was that the patient was asymptomatic, the second was marked absorption of pulmonary lesions on imaging, and the third was negative nucleic acid testing twice, with a one-day interval between the two tests.
已经出院的病人，体内会产生抗体，一般情况下，这个抗体在身体内会持续存在六七个月，也就是说，半年里不会生这个病毒的肺炎了。
Patients who have been discharged form the system develop antibodies that normally last six to seven months in the body, meaning that the virus does not develop pneumonia for six months.
目前金银潭医院500多个出院病人，还没有一个出现再感染的。
At present, more than 500 patients have been discharged from the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital.
我们还发现，新冠肺炎的病人的核酸检测从阳性转阴性的时间，一般是2-3周，所以目前对病人观察隔离14天还是有道理的。
We also found that patients with Newly Coronary Pneumonia had a positive-to-negative nucleic acid test time of 2-3 weeks, so the current 14-day isolation for patient observation makes sense.
如果要生病，那一定是在14天之内出现症状了，如果不生病，他就没有感染或者他自己就好了。
If you're sick, you must have had symptoms within 14 days. If you weren't ill, he wouldn't have been infected or would have been himself.
医护人员防护一直放在最重要位置《新民周刊》：到武汉工作将近20天，医护人员压力有没有缓解？周新：我们来了武汉以后，今天是礼拜几都搞不清楚了。
Health care workers protection has always been at the forefront of the "Xinmin Weekly": to work in Wuhan for nearly 20 days, the pressure of medical staff has eased? Zhou Xin: We came to Wuhan, today is a few weeks can not understand.
我们现在天天上班，没有休息，人家把病人交给你了，你不去怎么行呢？而且金银潭医院也不止我们上海的医疗队，大家一起工作，状态还是可以的。
We go to work every day, we don't have rest, people give patients to you, how can you not go? And gold and silver pool hospital is not only our medical team in Shanghai, we work together, the state is still OK.
一开始因为环境啊、工作流程啊都比较陌生，还是磨合了几天。
At first because of the environment, work flow ah strange, or wear a few days.
举个例子，这里的病房是临时改建的，把原来的普通病房改建为临时的重症监护病房，一开始可以说是要什么没什么，花了一段时间才熟悉，但现在大家已经习惯了。
For example, it took some time to get used to the makeshift, temporary conversion of the common ward into a temporary intensive care unit.
跟医生相比，我们的护士更加辛苦。
Our nurses work harder than the doctors.
因为病房里没有护工，所以除了要帮病人打针、发药，还要喂他吃饭，帮他监控呼吸机，处理大小便，翻身啊什么的，连打扫卫生都是护士来。
There were no nurses in the ward, so besides administering needles and medication to the patient, he had to be fed, he was monitored on the ventilator, he was taken to the toilet, he was turned over and over, and it was the nurse who cleaned the room.
而且生病的人容易情绪不好，有的病人还会把面罩不时拿掉，我们护士还要做心理工作，安抚他，工作非常辛苦。
And sick people tend to be in a bad mood, some patients will remove the mask from time to time, we nurses have to do psychological work, comfort him, very hard work.
另外一个，我们的防护物资还是能省则省。
On the other hand, our protective equipment can save money.
为了减少防护服和口罩的用量，我们医生尽量避免一起去查房的，每个医疗组每天安排两位医生进病房查看病人。
In order to reduce the use of protective clothing and masks, our doctors try to avoid going to the room together, and each medical team arranges two doctors to visit the patient every day.
粗略算一算，护士是4小时一个班，一天就有6批次，一天用几百套防护服是肯定的，消耗量很大。
In a rough calculation, nurses work four-hour shifts, six batches a day, hundreds of suits a day are a sure bet, and consumption is high.
社会上热心人士捐了很多防护服和护目镜，但我们检查下来，很多都不是医用的，不符合戴着进病房的标准。
Enthusiasts in the community donated a lot of protective clothing and goggles, but we checked out that many of them were not medical and did not meet the criteria for entering the ward.
《新民周刊》：一些新闻报道显示武汉医护人员感染的情况比较严重，我们在控制院感方面有哪些措施？周新：武汉的医护人员感染应该是早期的情况，因为当时大家对于疫情的研判是有限的人传人，医生在问诊的时候没有做好防护措施，所以导致了感染。
What measures do we take to control the infection of medical staff in Wuhan? Zhou Xin: The infection of medical staff in Wuhan should be an early stage, because the investigation of the epidemic was limited from person to person.
但现在大家的防护工作都已经跟上了，院感的问题已经得到了控制。
But now everyone's protection has kept pace, the hospital feeling problem has been brought under control.
我们上海医疗队也很重视这个问题，我们首先要保护好自己，才能够去救人家，如果你保护不了自己，那反而是害了人家，对吧？所以我们来了20天，现在还没有人被感染。
Our medical team in Shanghai also attaches great importance to this problem, we must first protect ourselves so that we can save others, if you can not protect yourself, it is harmful to others, right? So we came for 20 days, no one has been infected yet.
早期刚上夜班的时候，不能开空调，工作一晚上很冷，有一些队员感冒了，有点低烧，很紧张，后来用点感冒药就好了，做了核酸检测和CT，虚惊一场。
Early on night shift, can not turn on the air-conditioning, work all night very cold, some members of the cold, a little low fever, very nervous, and then use some cold medicine, do nucleic acid testing and CT, false alarm.
后来社会上捐赠了羽绒衣，这两天温度也上来了，好了很多了。
Later on the community donated feather jacket, these two days temperature also came up, much better.
《新民周刊》：您是第一批赶赴武汉的呼吸专家，也是医疗队里年纪最大的一位，您报名时是怎么想的？周新：我们上海是全国第一批赶到武汉的医疗队，我没时间多想，这是一个呼吸道的传染病，我本身就是呼吸科的医生，我理所当然要参加这个医疗队。
You were one of the first breathing experts to travel to Wuhan and the oldest member of the medical team.Zhou Xin: We were the first medical team in China to arrive in Wuhan, I don't have time to think about it.
我以前也参与过大的流行病防治工作，SARS的时候我去的是上海公共卫生临床中心，禽流感的时候我也参与了，所以对于我来讲，一点都不害怕。
I used to be involved in epidemic prevention and treatment, I went to the Shanghai Public Health Clinic in SARS, and I was involved in avian flu, so there was nothing to fear from me.
《新民周刊》：现在武汉的病人是一个什么样的情况？周新：刚来的时候，武汉的病人是非常多的， 现在各级各类管理逐渐见到了成效，现在开始从社区进行管理，做好隔离防护。
Zhou Xin: When Wuhan first arrived, the number of patients was very large, and now the management at all levels has gradually shown results, and now the management from the community, good isolation protection.
这样有一个好处，可以把病人给筛选出来。
This has the advantage of screening out patients.
习近平总书记在讲话中强调要做到“应收尽收、应治尽治”，各个医院都进一步加大了收治规模。
In his speech, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed the need to "collect as much as possible and treat as much as possible," and all hospitals have further increased the scale of treatment.
金银潭医院加了200张床，我所在的上海医疗队分管两个病区，原本每个病区是30个床位，现在加到了41张床位，总共加了22张床。
The Gold and Silver Pool Hospital has 200 beds, and my Shanghai medical team, which was in charge of two wards, has now added 41 beds to a total of 22 beds, instead of 30 beds per ward.
武汉开了很多方舱医院，接收新冠肺炎的轻症病人，疑似病例也都统一收进了宾馆酒店等场所统一管理，据我所知，武汉现在已经增援了17000多名医护人员，我相信随着这样的措施继续推行，新增病例的数据会逐渐有一个下降的趋势。
Wuhan has opened a lot of squares hospitals to receive patients with pneumonia, suspected cases have been unified into the hotel and other places under the unified management, as far as I know, Wuhan has now reinforced more than 17,000 medical personnel, I believe that as such measures continue, the number of new cases will gradually decline.
最大愿望，病人不要再增加《新民周刊》：对于现在要返工上班的人群来说，您有什么防护建议吗？收快递、收外卖还安全吗？周新：主要还是戴好口罩，勤洗手。
Do you have any protection advice for people who want to go back to work now? Is it safe to pick up couriers and take-out? Zhou Xin: Mainly wear masks and wash hands frequently.
普通人戴一般的口罩就可以了，酒精消毒都是次要的，现在很多人担心气溶胶传播，我觉得不需要太担心。
Ordinary people can wear ordinary masks, alcohol sterilization is secondary, now that many people worry about aerosols spread, I do not feel too worried.
因为空间一大，气溶胶中病毒的载量是很低的。
The viral load in aerosols is very low because of the large space available.
大家下了班回家可以洗个头洗个澡，现在大家应该都能做到的。
You can take a shower when you get home from work, and now everyone should be able to do it.
快递和外卖，大家都可以正常接收，但是拿好了以后要洗洗手，因为你也搞不清楚这些东西经过了哪些人的手。
Express delivery and take-out are acceptable to everyone, but wash your hands after you take them, because you don't know who's going through them.
《新民周刊》：现阶段您最大的愿望是什么？周新：我们希望病人越少越好，不要再多了。
What is your greatest wish at this stage? Zhou Xinxin: We hope that the fewer the patients, the better and not more.
