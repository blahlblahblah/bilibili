在特朗普政府不断削减开支与人事调动的背景下美国是否已经为这场新的流行病做好准备仍未可知3月6日，一名被确诊感染新冠肺炎的女子被送到美国内布拉斯加大学医疗中心。
Whether the United States is ready for the new epidemic against the backdrop of the Trump administration's continuing spending cuts and personnel transfers remains unclear. On March 6, a woman diagnosed with New Crown Pneumonia was sent to the University of Nebraska Medical Center.

“尽管媒体大肆呼吁新冠肺炎很可能席卷美国，但迄今为止，戴口罩者仍然只有华人。
"So far, only the Chinese have been wearing face masks, despite the media outcry that pneumonia is likely to engulf the United States.
没有任何隔离、停课、停工和检测等措施，口罩严重不足，检测费用高达两千美元……”这些抱怨与批评，充斥着美国的社交媒体，同时也出现在中国的网络平台上。
There is no segregation, no classes, no downtime, no testing, there is a serious shortage of masks, and the cost of testing can be as high as $2,000... "These complaints and criticisms are rife with social media in the United States and appear on Chinese Web platforms.
如果听到外界对美国的情况如此担忧，正在美国中部城市奥马哈的内布拉斯加大学医学中心隔离的卡尔·高曼肯定无法同意。
Karl Goldman, who is being quarantined at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in the central city of Omaha, would surely disagree.
住在这所自“9·11”事件之后建立并在埃博拉等传染病中发挥过作用的公卫医院，这位67岁的加州居民认为，他得到了全世界最棒的医疗服务。
The 67-year-old Californian, who lives in the public health hospital that was built after Sept. 11 and played a role in infectious diseases such as Ebola, believes he has the best medical care in the world.
他在钻石公主号邮轮上感染了新冠肺炎，并于2月17日送往该医院。
He contracted pneumonia on board the MV Princess Diamond and was taken to the hospital on February 17.
在这里他得到免费的治疗，防护装备齐全的管床医生至少每天探望他三次。
There he received free treatment and was visited at least three times a day by a fully equipped tube-bed doctor.
为避免因隔离造成的心理状况恶化，每天下午3点，15个在该医学中心接受治疗和隔离的患者都会在一个在线电话会议中连线，出席的还有美国疾控中心（CDC）员工、主治医师、护士和心理医生，告知他们新冠疫情的最新状况，回答他们的问题并提供安抚。
To avoid a deterioration in psychological conditions caused by isolation, 15 patients treated and quarantined at the Medical Center are connected to an online conference call at 3 p.m. each day, along with CDC staff, attending physicians, nurses and psychologists, to update them on the new crown epidemic, answer their questions and provide reassurance.
2月27日，他与同在该医院的妻子还接到了美国分管新冠疫情的副总统迈克·彭斯的来电。
On 27 February, he and his wife, who were also in the hospital, also received a call from the Vice-President of the United States, Mike Burns, responsible for the New Crown.
这些细节，都透露着美国对新冠的重视。
These details reveal the importance the US attaches to the new crown.
“美国对新冠病毒防控相对来说是比较积极的。
"The United States is relatively active in preventing and controlling the new crown virus.
”加州大学洛杉矶分校公共卫生学院副院长、流行病学资深终身教授张作风向《中国新闻周刊》表示，“第一例新冠肺炎患者死亡时，美国总统、副总统、卫生部长一起召开记者招待会，说明很重视。
Zhang style, vice-dean and senior professor of epidemiology at UCLA School of Public Health, told China News Weekly: "When the first case of New Crown Pneumonia died, the US President, Vice President, and Secretary of Health held a press conference showing the importance attached to it.
现在为了应对新冠流行，美国政府基本上是全部动员起来，包括疾控中心、卫生部、紧急事件办公室，很多机构都协调在一起了。
The U. S. government is now largely mobilized to deal with the new crown epidemic, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Health, the Office of Emergency Situations, and many agencies are working together.
”2月26日晚，美国总统特朗普在白宫举行新闻发布会宣布，副总统彭斯将领导美国政府应对新冠肺炎疫情的工作。
On the night of February 26, US President Trump announced at a White House press conference that Vice President Burns would lead the US government's response to the outbreak of pneumonia in the New Crown.
摄影/本刊记者 陈孟统然而，并不是所有人都如此乐观。
Photo / print journalist Chen Meng-tung However, not everyone is so optimistic.
美国外交关系委员会全球卫生问题前高级研究员劳丽·加勒特（Laurie Garrett）是全球公共卫生领域资深观察者。
Laurie Garrett, a former senior researcher on global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, is a senior observer of global public health.
在美国感染者人数寥寥无几的1月末，她就指出美国对流行病应对的准备不足。
At the end of January, when few Americans were infected, she pointed out that the United States was ill-prepared for the epidemic.
她把美国的流行病防治体系比作一个庞大的、没有指挥的管弦乐队，里面全是才华横溢的乐手，但每个人都想独奏成名。
She likened America's epidemiological system to a huge, unguided orchestra filled with talented musicians, but everyone wanted to be famous solo.
紧张还是恐慌美国西雅图Franciscan医疗机构心脏科医生高磊所在的华盛顿州国王郡当属美国目前新冠疫情最为严重的地区之一。
Tension or panic Cardiologist Gao Lei of Seattle's Franciscan Medical Center is in one of the worst-hit areas in the United States.
截至3月8日下午5点，美国确诊感染的436例病人中，有71例来自国王郡。
As of 5 p.m. March 8, 71 of the 436 patients diagnosed with infection in the United States were from Kings County.
1月20日，美国首例确诊病例出现在华盛顿州；2月29日，全美首例新冠肺炎死亡病例也出现在该州。
The first confirmed case in the United States was in Washington state on January 20, and the first case of New Crown Pneumonia occurred in the state on Feb. 29.
而国王郡所辖柯克兰市暴发了全美最严重的集中感染——截至3月8日下午5时，美国出现的17例死亡病例中，就有14例与柯克兰一家老人护理中心有关。
And Kirkland, the king's county, has the worst concentrated infection in the country.As of 5 p.m. March 8, 14 of the 17 deaths in the United States were related to the Kirkland Geriatric Care Center.
3月3日，高磊去医院出诊，正好碰到医院给医护人员进行院内感染培训，原本每年都会常规培训一次，但这次却是为应对新冠而临时新增的。
On March 3, Gao Lei went to the hospital for medical staff training on nosocomial infection. He was trained once a year, but this time it was added on an ad hoc basis to cope with the new crowns.
医院有确诊病例后，急诊室的大厅和20个病房已在两天内全部改装成负压区。
With confirmed cases in the hospital, the emergency room lobby and 20 wards were completely converted to negative pressure areas within two days.
不过整体来说，即便医院ICU里有一例新冠肺炎患者，高磊也没有感受到周边人有什么恐慌情绪。
But overall, even with a case of nosocomial pneumonia in the hospital's ICU, Gao Lei doesn't feel any panic among those around him.
“我当然很紧张，但是我不恐慌。
"Of course I'm nervous, but I don't panic.
昨天（3月2日）美国病例增加比较多，但我们门诊预约的21个常规病人全都来了，今天也只有3个病人未如约就诊，其中一个是95岁的老太太，因为老年人比较易感，她说她有点担心。
Yesterday (March 2) there was a big increase in the number of cases in the United States, but only three of the 21 routine patients we made an appointment with the clinic arrived today, including a 95-year-old woman who said she was worried because of the vulnerability of the elderly.
”高磊告诉《中国新闻周刊》。
Gao told China News Weekly.
当中国人用戴口罩的办法来抵御病毒、国内“一罩难求”的时候，美国对外关系委员会全球卫生高级研究员黄严忠却注意到，即使在人流攒动的纽约地铁站，他也没有见到戴口罩的人。
When the Chinese responded to the virus with a mask, Huang Yanzhong, a senior global health researcher at the Council on Foreign Relations, noticed that he did not see anyone wearing a mask even in a crowded New York subway station.
国内对美国人的这种做法非常不解，甚至认为，这是美国口罩产量不足而政府又不作为的后果。
There is a great deal of confusion at home about what Americans are doing, even as a result of insufficient production of US masks and the inaction of the government.
但实际上，美国人这么做有自己的理由。
But in reality, Americans do it for a reason of their own.
张作风解释说，因为美国的人群密度比较小，人与人之间的距离比较大，而且乘坐公共交通的概率也不高，基于此，美国权威指南和医疗习惯中，只是提示病人戴口罩。
Because people in the United States are less densely populated, people are more distant from one another, and less likely to travel on public transportation, Zhang explains, US authorities and medical practices only prompt patients to wear masks.
因此国内的人来美国，不了解这种理念差异，觉得戴口罩能保护自己，实际上容易被误解，容易被旁人看做是病人。
Therefore, the domestic people come to the United States, do not understand this difference in the concept, feel that wearing masks can protect themselves, in fact easy to be misunderstood, easy to be seen as patients.
高磊在两天中接诊近40个病人，其中只有两位佩戴了口罩。
Gao treated nearly 40 patients in two days, only two of whom wore masks.
2009年，美国1.2万人死于H1N1流感。
In 2009, 12,000 people died in the United States as a result of H1N1 influenza.
高磊记忆中那次“抗疫战斗”的措施就是勤洗手，在医院他没有被要求戴口罩，街上民众也如此。
Gao's memory of the "battle against the plague" was to wash his hands frequently, and he was not required to wear a mask at the hospital, nor were the people on the street.
3月7日，高磊接到医院医疗系统的电子邮件称，有足够的N95口罩供使用。
On March 7, Gao Lei received an e-mail from the hospital medical system saying there were enough N95 masks for him to use.
在接诊了新冠病人的ICU，透过门上的玻璃，他可以看到里面护士头盔、防护服，全副武装，但ICU外面护士站的工作人员都没戴口罩。
At ICU, where the newly-crowned patient was treated, he could see through the glass door that the nurse's helmet, protective clothing, and all were armed, but none of the nurses outside the ICU were wearing masks.
不过，当需要戴口罩防护时，培训是非常严格的。
However, when mask protection is required, the training is very strict.
高磊说，会用一个套子把头罩住，在套子里喷一种刺激的喷雾，然后让人深呼吸，如果闻到了就说明口罩没有正确佩戴。
Mr. Gao says the mask will be covered with a condom, sprayed with an irritating spray, and breathed deeply. If you smell it, you don't wear it correctly.
在过去几次大流感中，美国积累了这方面的应急经验。
The United States has accumulated emergency experience in this area over the past few pandemic influenza outbreaks.
约翰·霍普金斯大学布隆博格公共卫生学院健康安全中心几位学者3月3日在《美国医学会杂志》上撰文指出，在2003年SARS和2005年H5N1流行之后，美国政府、医院和企业为大流行做了好几年的准备。
The United States Government, hospitals and businesses have been preparing for a pandemic for several years after the SARS and H5N1 epidemics of 2005, wrote in the March 3 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.
2009年春季，美国出现新型H1N1流感，重症率高且无疫苗可用，大流感计划被激活，而且医疗机构做了许多改进。
In the spring of 2009, a new H1N1 flu virus emerged in the United States, with high and no vaccine available, pandemic influenza plans were activated and many improvements were made in medical institutions.
因此，现在应对新冠，美国仍然可以在此基础上做准备。
So, with the new crown now, the US can still build on it.
美国CDC也表示，目前正在基于此前应对大流感的经验，来强化对新冠暴发的响应，比如，他们已与地方公卫实验室合作，利用现有的流感和病毒性呼吸道监测系统，启动社区流感状疾病监测，以快速发现和追踪病毒是否在社区传播。
The U.S. CDC also said it was building on its previous experience with pandemic influenza to strengthen its response to the outbreak, for example, by working with local public health laboratories to activate community influenza disease surveillance using existing influenza and viral respiratory monitoring systems to quickly detect and track virus transmission in the community.
为应对新冠，美国政府也在调动人力、物力和财力。
In response to the new crown, the United States Government is also mobilizing human, material and financial resources.
早至1月29日，总统特朗普便成立了一个新冠特别行动小组。
As early as January 29, President Trump established a new Crown Task Force.
新冠疫情在中国暴发后，美国国家过敏和传染性疾病研究所（NIAID）就迅速整合国内和国际研究资源，在基础研究方面发力，同时与医药界合作，启动疫苗和药物的研发。
Following the outbreak of the New Crown Disease outbreak in China, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) rapidly consolidated domestic and international research resources for basic research, while working with the pharmaceutical community to initiate vaccine and drug research and development.
3月6日，特朗普还签署了一项由国会两党达成的约83亿美元的新冠疫情紧急拨款，这一数额远高于特朗普政府最初向国会要求的25亿美元。
On March 6, Trump also signed into law a bipartisan new crown emergency allocation of about $8.3 billion, far more than the $2.5 billion originally requested by the Trump administration from Congress.
但看似准备充分的背后，也危机四伏。
But behind the seemingly well-prepared, there are dangers.
2018年，特朗普撤销了此前奥巴马政府为应对埃博拉疫情而设立的流行病应对指挥系统。
In 2018, Trump reversed the epidemiological chain of command that the Obama administration had established in response to the Ebola epidemic.
财政预算上也是一再削减。
Budget cuts have been repeated.
比如，2018年春天，特朗普政府减少了150亿美元的国家卫生支出，并削减了CDC、国家安全委员会、国土安全部等机构的全球疾病抗击运营预算。
For example, in the spring of 2018, the Trump administration cut $15 billion in national health spending, and cut the global budget for fighting disease in institutions like the CDC, the National Security Council, and the Department of Homeland Security.
政府3000万美元的“复杂危机基金”也被取消了。
The government's $30 million Complex Crisis Fund was also scrapped.
哈佛大学医学文化学教授大卫·琼斯提到，显然特朗普就新冠疫情发了很多的推特——大多是关于疫情对股票市场的影响，但是我们很难对他委任副总统彭斯负责应对新冠肺炎疫情这一举措抱有信心。
David Jones, a professor of medical culture at Harvard University, notes that Trump has apparently tweeted a lot about the new crown - mostly about the impact of the epidemic on the stock market - but it is hard to be confident that he appointed Vice President Burns to deal with the outbreak.
2013年~2017年，彭斯任印第安纳州州长期间，因防控不力，导致辖区内200余位居民感染了艾滋病。
In 2013-2017, during his tenure as governor of Indiana, Pence became infected with AIDS among more than 200 residents of his district, owing to poor control.
跨党派的外交政策智库战略与国际研究中心在此次新冠疫情之前就表示，特朗普政府严重缺乏准备，美国要么现在必须拨款以获得保护和安全，要么在下一次流行中付出更大的生命和经济成本。
The Center for Strategic and International Studies, a cross-party foreign-policy think tank, said before the new outbreak that the Trump administration was badly unprepared, and that the US must either allocate funds now to secure protection and security, or pay more in human and economic costs in the next pandemic.
“‘下一次流行’已经出现了。
"" The next fad has come out.
我们很快就会知道，特朗普政府早期的疏忽和已出现的恐慌造成的代价。
We will soon know the cost of the Trump administration's early negligence and the panic that has erupted.
”劳丽·加勒特表示。
'said Laurie Garrett.
从混乱到调整2月26日，美国CDC警告，随着越来越多的国家经历社区传播，企图在边境成功遏制新冠病毒变得越来越困难。
From chaos to adjustment February 26, the United States CDC warned that as more and more countries experience community-to-community transmission, it is becoming increasingly difficult to successfully contain the Crown virus at borders.
CDC国家免疫与呼吸疾病中心主任梅森尼尔表示，“最终，我们预期美国会出现社区传播。
"Ultimately, we expect community transmission in the United States," says Mason Neal, director of the CDC's National Centre for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.
问题不在于这种情况是否会发生，而是何时会发生，以及这个国家有多少人会因此病情危重。
The question is not whether this will happen, but when, and how many people in the country will be critically ill.
”宁静的打破出现在同一天。
The quiet break came on the same day.
2月26日，美国CDC宣布加州出现首例无法确定接触史的新冠肺炎患者，可能是美国出现社区传播的一个佐证；2月29日，前述华盛顿州养老院出现了聚集性感染病例。
On Feb. 26, the U.S. CDC announced that California's first case of unconfirmed exposure to pneumonia could be evidence of community transmission in the United States. On February 29, a case of conglomerate infection was reported in a nursing home in Washington state.
截至3月3日，加州、华盛顿州和佛罗里达州共出现了十余例感染途径未知的病例，提示美国多个州已经出现了社区传播。
As of March 3, more than a dozen cases with unknown transmission routes had emerged in California, Washington and Florida, suggesting that community transmission has occurred in several states.
随着疫情进入新阶段，美国的一些应对策略开始受到炮轰，受到指责最多的地方听起来似曾相识：筛查对象的指标过于严格；诊断试剂盒质量存在缺陷、数量不足等。
As the epidemic entered a new phase, some of America's response strategies began to come under fire, with the most frequently criticized sounding familiar: overly stringent targets for screening; and defective, insufficient diagnostic kits.
“我们早期在检测方面毫无疑问是有些混乱的。
"There is no doubt that we were a bit confused early on in terms of testing.
一些技术问题拖慢了检测过程。
Some technical problems slowed down the testing process.
”NIAID所长安东尼·福奇近日接受媒体采访时承认。
Anthony Fauci, the director of NIAID, admitted in a recent interview.
2月19日，前述美国首例无法溯源的患者转来加州大学戴维斯医学中心就诊时已经使用呼吸机，医院希望为他进行检测，但因为当时不符合检测标准而没有立即得到批准，数日后，病毒检测结果出来呈阳性。
On February 19, the first non-traceable patient in the United States was referred to the University of California, Davis Medical Center for a ventilator, and the hospital hoped to test him, but was not immediately approved because it did not meet the test criteria. A few days later, the virus tested positive.
美国CDC解释说，发热、咳嗽和呼吸困难等症状作为接受检测的指标过于宽泛，尤其在流感季，所以不得不剔除掉其他原因引发的呼吸道疾病；而且新冠肺炎是一个输入型疾病，因而对病例进行调查一开始主要针对有相关旅行史的人群。
The United States CDC explained that symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath were too broad indicators to be tested, especially during the flu season, so respiratory illnesses caused by other causes had to be eliminated; and that new crown pneumonia was an imported disease, so the investigation of cases began primarily among people with a relevant travel history.
但CDC初期过于严苛的标准引起很大争议，尤其是考虑美国可能社区流行已经有一定时间了。
But the CDC's initially overly stringent standards have been highly controversial, especially given that the US may have been in vogue for some time.
3月1日，位于西雅图的华盛顿大学福瑞德·哈金森癌症研究中心科学家发现，将美国首例与华盛顿州2月28日宣布的另一病例的病毒基因排序加以比较后发现，两宗病例的基因类似，暗示新冠病毒可能在该州已经扩散长达6个星期而未被觉察。
Scientists at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center at the University of Washington in Seattle on March 1 found that comparing the first case in the United States with the genetic sequencing of another case announced on February 28 in Washington state showed that the genes in the two cases were similar, suggesting that the virus could have spread undetected in the state for six weeks.
不过，首例无法溯源的病例出现后的次日，亦即2月27日，CDC便更新了哪些病例需要接受调查的指标，其中暴露史纳入新的重点关注国家和社区，并保持动态调整。
However, the day after the first non-traceable case emerged, on 27 February, the CDC updated the indicators of which cases required investigation, in which exposure history was incorporated into the new country and community focus and remained dynamically adjusted.
张作风说，虽然问题不断，但在媒体和公众舆论的监督下，美国的策略调整和纠正也比较快。
Zhang said that although the problem is constant, but under the supervision of the media and public opinion, the U. S. strategy adjustment and correction is faster.
《科学》杂志2月28日的文章批评说，中国现在每周可以进行多达160万次病毒检测；而韩国也已经对65000余人进行了病毒检测。
A Feb. 28 article in the journal Science criticized that up to 1.6 million virus tests can now be performed weekly in China, while South Korea has tested more than 65,000 people for the virus.
相比之下，美国CDC自疫情开始以来只做了459次检测。
In contrast, the United States CDC has done only 459 tests since the outbreak began.
美国CDC于2月5日开始向各州和地方卫生实验室发送检测试剂盒。
The United States CDC began sending test kits to state and local health laboratories on February 5.
但在2月12日，CDC透露，由于其中一个试剂组件出了问题，好几个实验室在验证测试结果时遇到了困难。
But on February 12, the CDC revealed that several laboratories had difficulty validating the test results because one of the reagent components was faulty.
张作风解释，美国的试剂盒与中国和世界卫生组织的不太一样，它通过测定新冠病毒的三个基因来确诊，但因为生产和测试过程容易受到污染，其中一个基因容易产生混淆结果，CDC于是将这个组件去掉，采取两个基因进行检测，但是最终仍需CDC确诊。
Zhang explains that the US kit, unlike that of China and the World Health Organization, is diagnosed by testing three genes for the new crown virus, but because the production and testing process is susceptible to contamination, with one gene prone to confusion, the CDC removes the component and tests it with two genes, but still needs to be confirmed by the CDC.
2月28日，CDC开始将检测权限下放至州一级，并与FDA合作，尽快批准改进后的试剂盒的紧急使用许可，在次日便得到FDA回应。
On February 28, the CDC began decentralizing testing to the state level, working with the FDA to approve an improved emergency license for the kit as soon as possible, with an FDA response the next day.
为了解决试剂盒数量不足的问题，CDC在3月6日之前分发能够对110万人进行测试的测试套件，到下周将进行100万次测试。
To address the shortage of test kits, the CDC distributed test kits capable of testing 1.1 million people by March 6, with one million tests next week.
美国副总统彭斯3月4日宣布，只要医生同意，任何人都能得到检测。
Vice President Burns announced on March 4 that anyone could be tested with the doctor's consent.
根据新的标准，发烧、咳嗽或呼吸困难的患者有资格接受诊断性检测，这取决于他们医生的判断。
According to the new criteria, patients with fever, cough or breathing difficulties are eligible for diagnostic tests, depending on the judgement of their doctor.
美国卫生与公众服务部部长阿扎尔3月7日在白宫记者会上补充，“我们作为监管者，或者作为测试的提供者，并不限制可接受测试的人。
"As regulators, or as test providers, we do not limit who can be tested," Health and Human Services Secretary Asif Azar added at a White House news conference on March 7.
我们将其留给医生、公共卫生实验室官员进行专业判断。
We leave it to the professional judgment of doctors, public health laboratory officials.
除非有医生或公卫人员开出检验单，否则你将无法获得检验。
You will not be able to get a test unless a doctor or a public health officer issues an inspection form.
”截至3月7日，纽约市只有大约120人经过测试。
As of March 7, only about 120 people in New York City had been tested.
纽约州州长安德鲁·古莫3月8日批评CDC对私立实验室的检测权限下放太慢，耽误了病例发现，纽约州有7个实验室可以开展检测，只等联邦CDC一声令下。
NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo criticized the CDC's slow devolution of testing rights to private laboratories, delaying the discovery of cases and leaving seven New York state laboratories open for testing pending federal CDC orders.
在当日新闻发布会上，安德鲁·古莫介绍，目前纽约州有106个病例，但在病毒检测能力提升之前，他对全州的疫情依然无法摸底。
Andrew Cuomo told a news conference that there were 106 cases in New York state, but he was still unsure of the disease until his ability to detect the virus improved.
黄严忠同时也是美国西东大学的雇员，他说学校正在春假中，但学校已在为应对疫情做准备，成立了一个专门的委员会。
Huang Yanzhong, an employee at the Southwest University in the United States, said the school was in spring break, but was already preparing for the epidemic by setting up a special committee.
作为成员之一，他与其他专家正在制定学校接下来的应对政策，包括何时需要开始网络授课、学校食堂是否照常营业等细节问题。
As a member, he and other experts are working on the school's next policy, including details of when online classes need to begin and whether school canteens will be open as usual.
他说，因为疫情正在美国加速蔓延，现在许多高校已经开始转向网络授课，许多会议已经取消，教堂等公共场合的人流也在减少。
'Because the epidemic is accelerating in the U.S., many colleges and universities are shifting to online classes, many meetings have been canceled and the flow of people to public places such as churches is decreasing, "he said.
CDC的最新指南建议，60岁以上以及有潜在健康问题的群体强烈考虑避免参加人群密集的活动。
The CDC's latest guidelines recommend that groups over 60 and those with potential health problems strongly consider avoiding crowd-intensive activities.
这两个高危人群应考虑避免乘飞机旅行、去电影院、参加家庭活动，在拥挤的购物中心购物以及参加宗教仪式等。
These two high-risk groups should consider avoiding air travel, going to the cinema, attending family events, shopping in crowded shopping centres and attending religious ceremonies.
因为有中国严防死守的隔离措施做参照，美国采取的这些措施看起来有些“毛毛雨”了。
The measures taken by the United States look "drizzling" because of China's tight quarantine measures.
对此，上海市新冠肺炎医疗救治专家组组长、复旦大学附属华山医院感染科主任张文宏就表示，“我们现在着急得不得了，觉得美国怎么还不把街道给封了？怎么还不戴口罩？是不是没有口罩？实际上，当病例数量达到一定程度时，美国各地就会启动相应的应急等级，有关的社区、医院等等会据此做相应的预判。
"We are in such a hurry that we don't think the United States is sealing the streets yet? Why not wear masks? Are there no masks? In fact, when the number of cases reaches a certain level, the corresponding emergency levels will be activated throughout the United States and the communities, hospitals and so on will make corresponding judgments.
”中国规模浩大的隔离措施，包括对超千万人口的大城市武汉实行封城，让美国范德堡大学医学中心传染病专家威廉·沙夫纳非常钦佩。
China's massive isolation, including the closure of Wuhan, a mega-city with a population of more than 10 million, is admired by William Shavner, an infectious-diseases expert at the Vanderborg University Medical Center.
“中国实现了史无前例的隔离措施，这在美国是无法想象的，我们的社会与治理体系不同。
"China has achieved unprecedented isolation, which is unthinkable in the United States, and our society is different from the system of governance.
”3月8日，洛杉矶第35届马拉松依然如期举行。
On March 8, the 35th marathon in Los Angeles continued on schedule.
尽管一位市议会成员质疑是否值得冒险举行这个比赛，但官员们认为还没有构成公共威胁。
Although a city council member questioned whether it was worth the risk, officials said there was no public danger.
参与者们被告知不要握手，建议进行手消毒、保持一定距离等。
Participants were told not to shake hands and were advised to disinfect their hands and keep a distance.
“现在，对于新冠病毒，有两种态度，要么非常严肃地对待它，买光Costco超市所有的厕纸（为居家做准备），要么一笑了之。
"Right now, there are two attitudes to the new crown virus, either take it very seriously, buy all the toilet paper in Costco's supermarket and laugh it off.
”在马拉松赛现场，一位洛杉矶居民说，这绝对不是什么不值一提的事情，但她的态度是，不至于因此把自己锁在家里。
'It's definitely not a trivial thing, 'said a Los Angeles resident at the Marathon, but' it's not like she's locking herself up at home.
政治博弈与信息透明张文宏认为，美国和新加坡采取的都是较为稳健的策略，比如没有宣布取消大型活动，没有强调口罩的重要性。
Both the U.S. and Singapore have adopted more robust strategies, such as not announcing big events or emphasizing the importance of face masks, Zhang Wenhong said.
这是因为在早期，新冠对于美国仍是一个输入性疾病，且中国的疫情逐渐明朗，世界对于新冠的重症率和致死性也有了初步了解，不再是盲人摸象的状态了。
This is because, in the early years, the new crown was still an imported disease for the United States, and as the Chinese epidemic became clearer, the world gained a rudimentary understanding of the severity and lethality of the new crown, rather than a state of blindness.
但也有学者担忧，考虑到今年是美国的选举年，政府可能会对新冠病毒的严重性轻描淡写。
But some scholars worry that the government may downplay the severity of the new crown virus, given that this is an election year for the United States.
2月26日，在白宫的新闻发布会上，当被问及学校是否应该为疫情做准备，特朗普就表示：“我认为我们社会的各行各业都应该做好准备。
When asked at a White House press conference on February 26 whether schools should be prepared for the epidemic, Trump said: "I think all walks of life in our society should be prepared.
但我不认为会到那种地步，尤其是考虑到我们的感染人数正在下降而非上升的事实。
But I don't think it will go that far, especially given the fact that the number of infected people is falling, not rising.
”然而，美国CDC的高级官员刚刚才在这场发布会上表示他们预计将会出现更多病例。
However, senior officials from the US CDC have just told the conference that they expect more cases.
与之类似，2月末的一天，CDC官员说新冠病毒传播的风险是明确的，而总统的经济顾问则说病毒已经被遏制。
Similarly, one day in late February, CDC officials said the risk of transmission was clear, while the president's economic advisers said the virus had been contained.
张作风认为，美国白宫有时候会说新冠疫情相当于流感，是因为不希望影响经济。
Zhang thinks the White House sometimes says the new crown is the equivalent of flu because it does not want to affect the economy.
既要控制疫情，也要保住经济，才不会影响选举。
The elections will not be affected if the epidemic is to be contained and the economy preserved.
但行政官员与卫生官员前后不一的说法受到了媒体与学者批评。
But inconsistencies between administrators and health officials have been criticized by the media and academics.
3月5日，《纽约时报》逐一梳理了新冠疫情在美国出现以来特朗普的发言，对于那些与事实不符、与相关机构结论相矛盾的措辞，直截了当地给予了抨击。
On March 5, the New York Times sorted out Trump's statements since the emergence of the New York Times in the United States, bluntly criticizing language that did not correspond to reality and contradicted the agency's conclusions.
不过，在政治博弈之外，疫情和健康宣教信息的获取，是多位专业人士认为公众不恐慌的原因之一。
Beyond political gaming, however, the epidemic and the availability of health education messages are among the reasons that many professionals believe the public is not panicking.
张作风居住的加州洛杉矶，目前为止已经有十几例确诊者。
Zhang style of living in Los Angeles, California, so far there have been a dozen confirmed cases.
他住所附近的医院出现了一例感染者，他任教的加州大学洛杉矶分校在3月6日则有3个学生被隔离。
A case of infection appeared in a hospital near his home, and three students were quarantined on March 6 at UCLA, where he teaches.
但是周围除了华人去买米、囤水，美国人似乎并不恐慌。
But Americans do not seem to be panicking, except for Chinese who are buying rice and hoarding water.
学校出现学生隔离那天，张作风收到了学校邮件，里面解释学校现在遇到的情况是什么，下一步的计划等等。
On the day of school segregation, Zhang style received a school email explaining what was happening to her school and what she planned to do next.
这三名学生的测试结果均为阴性的当天，校长通过电子邮件将结果及时告知了所有教职员工和学生。
On the day the tests were negative, the headmaster e-mailed all staff and students.
张作风说，“数据与疫情的清晰度非常高，大家知道情况以后就不会心慌。
'The clarity of the data and the epidemic is very high, 'Zhang said.
”传染科医生威廉·沙夫纳最近有些忙碌，尽管他所在的田纳西州到3月5日才出现首例新冠肺炎感染者，过去的5周他一直在为新冠肺炎忙活，包括为医院医务工作者进行防护培训和准备、与CDC的研究小组讨论如何统计病例数量，此外他还有一个任务是：接受采访。
Dr. William Shafner has been busy lately, though his Tennessee state didn't have its first case of pneumonia until March 5, and has spent the past five weeks training and preparing hospital health workers for protection, discussing with the CDC research group how to count the number of cases and giving an interview.
在最近这段日子，他已经接受了上百家媒体的采访。
In recent days, he has given interviews to hundreds of media outlets.
来自专业人士的发声是美国社会为教育民众所做努力的一部分。
The voices of professionals are part of American society's efforts to educate its people.
3月3日，高磊收到了5封医院的电子邮件，告知他如何保护自己、如果出现疑似病人应该处理等等……他的父亲也在他所工作的这家医院就诊，他同样收到了医院专门给患者发送的邮件，告知如果出现什么情况，应该采取哪些对应的措施、什么情况需要去急诊。
On March 3, Gao Lei received e-mails from five hospitals telling him how to protect himself, if a suspected patient should be treated, and so on... his father was at the same hospital where he worked, and he also received a special message from the hospital informing him of what measures should be taken and what needed to be done in an emergency.
在医院，高磊的病人们透露出了这种从容，跟他说，“目前这个新冠就是一个大号的流感，勤洗手、远离人群、避免接触感染者，如果有不舒服，就待在家里自己隔离。
At the hospital, Gao's patients revealed the ease, telling him: "The new crown is a huge flu that washes hands frequently, keeps away from crowds, avoids contact with infected people, and stays at home and quarantined if uncomfortable.
所有的措施和防流感一样，平时每年都这样过来，今年就是需要更加留意。
All measures are the same as anti-flu, usually so every year, this year just need to pay more attention.
”发现这些病人紧跟CDC的指南，他感到放心很多。
Finding these patients close to the CDC's guidelines reassured him.
让公众不恐慌，是一种重要的防控策略。
Allowing the public not to panic is an important control strategy.
岑瀑啸是美国佛罗里达州奥兰多市一家医院的心脏科医师，她说，“新冠肺炎很可怕，它的传播很快、很广，重症率和致死率都比流感要高，而且没有疫苗与有效的抗病毒治疗。
Cen Falls, a cardiologist at a hospital in Orlando, Fla., says: "New Crown Pneumonia is terrifying. It's spreading fast, it's killing rates are higher than flu, and there is no vaccine or effective antiviral treatment.
正因为如此，如果让大多数没有医学知识的人慌张起来，让80％的轻症病人去免疫力低下人群聚集的医疗场所，造成院内感染，情况会更糟糕。
That is why the situation would be even worse if most people with no medical knowledge were to panic and send 80% of light patients to places where people with low immunity congregate, causing nosocomial infections.
”3月7日，在美国塔科马，人们在一家超市抢购卫生纸。
On March 7, people snapped up toilet paper at a supermarket in Tacoma, US.
图/美联岑瀑啸说，与中国不一样，这样做的前提是，美国的医疗资源在基层也分布密集，而且基层医护人员的专业水平非常可靠，这使得几乎所有民众都可在其就近的医疗场所得到高质量的治疗。
Unlike in China, says Tu / Utzen Falls, this is premised on the fact that health resources in the United States are also concentrated at the grass-roots level and that the professionalism of primary health-care workers is very reliable, making it possible for almost all people to receive quality treatment at their nearest health-care facilities.
因此，鼓励人们在家自我隔离，不会耽误病情。
Therefore, people are encouraged to isolate themselves at home without delay.
相比之下，如果所有感染者都涌向医院，就会出现严重的医疗资源挤兑和院内感染。
By contrast, if all infected people flock to hospitals, there will be a severe run on medical resources and nosocomial infections.
华中师范大学大数据传播与应急管理研究中心主任喻发胜对此就表示，“传染病传播和暴发期的首要任务是隔离传染源，隔离优先于救治。
"The number one priority in the transmission and outbreak phase is to isolate the source of infection, with isolation taking precedence over treatment," Yu Fengsheng, director of the Center for Big Data Dissemination and Emergency Management Research at Central China Normal University, said.
早期看到大量传染病人自行就医，导致一人就医、数人感染，这样的传染恶性循环不打破，有多少医生和资源都不够用。
The vicious circle of infection, in which large numbers of infected persons are seen seeking medical attention on their own, leading to one person seeking medical attention and several infections, is not broken, and the number of doctors and resources is insufficient.
