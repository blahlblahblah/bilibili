记者/张蕊编辑/杨宝璐 宋建华经济学家贾康持续两月的新冠肺炎疫情，给中国经济带来巨大负面冲击，不少企业生产经营也因此面临困难。
Journalist / Zhang Lian editor / Yang Polo Song Jianhua economist Jia Kang's two-month outbreak of the New Crown Pneumonia has brought a huge negative impact on the Chinese economy, and many enterprises face difficulties in production and management.
当前，结束了春节假期的各地企业，正逐步推进复工复产，复工，意味着人群的流动和聚集，如何在力保疫情不扩散的同时，尽快恢复生产，是摆在各地政府面前的一道难题。
At present, enterprises around the world that have completed the Spring Festival are gradually resuming work and resuming work, which means that people are moving and gathering together. How to ensure the non-proliferation of the epidemic while resuming production as soon as possible is a difficult issue for governments all over the world.
深一度记者采访了经济学家、国家“十三五”规划专家委员会委员贾康。
At one point, the reporter interviewed the economist and member of the National "13th Five-Year Plan Expert Committee."
在贾康看来，此次新冠肺炎疫情对中国经济的增速确实产生了不利影响，但这个影响总体而言是“短期的、有限的”，他告诉深一度记者，此次疫情对于经济指数的主要影响是在2020年一季度，特别是进入二月后的这段时间。
For Jakang, the new outbreak does have a negative impact on China's economic growth, but the impact is generally "short-term and limited," he told reporters, adding that the main impact of the outbreak on economic indicators will be in the first quarter of 2020, especially into February.
但“前低”之后，一定会出现“后高”。
But after the "low front," there must be a "back high."
经济指数“前低”之后，一定会“后高”深一度：从宏观的角度来说，您认为疫情对经济的影响主要有什么？影响的大小取决于什么？影响最大的行业又是哪些？贾康：从整个趋势来看，疫情对经济增速确实有一定的不利影响，本来经济就有下行压力，现在下行压力更大了。
After the "low-to-the-top" economic index, it is certain to be "post-high": from a macro perspective, what do you think is the main impact of the epidemic on the economy?
从目前的情况来看，主要影响是在一季度，特别是二月以后的这段时间。
From the current situation, the main impact is in the first quarter, especially after February.
但前低之后，一定会出现后高。
But when the front is low, it must appear later.
毕竟战胜疫情是早晚的事情，“后高”的结果绝对是可期的。
After all, it is only a matter of time before the epidemic is overcome.
当下最重要的工作是尽可能减少在克服疫情当中的代价，尽可能使国民经济和社会生活相对顺利地得到恢复和发展。
The most important task now is to minimize the cost of overcoming the epidemic and to make the recovery and development of national economic and social life as smooth as possible.
这就需要根据情况，总结经验教训，优化对策措施。
This requires, according to the circumstances, learning lessons and optimizing countermeasures.
疫情影响的大小主要取决于疫情得到控制的情况和时间。
The magnitude of the epidemic's impact depends largely on how and when the outbreak is contained.
现在除湖北之外，其他地方情况明显好转。
Except for Hubei, the situation is obviously better now.
主要是武汉和湖北受到的冲击，在全国来说相对较大。
Wuhan and Hubei are mainly affected by the impact, in the country is relatively large.
从行业的冲击来看，首先冲击的就是服务业，特别是客运、餐饮、家政服务等，此外，小微企业冲击也比较大。
From the impact of the industry, the first impact is the service industry, especially passenger transport, catering, domestic services, but also the impact of micro and small enterprises.
深一度：您刚才说，疫情对于一季度的经济指数影响会比较大，那对全年GDP影响会有多大？您对此是否有预估？贾康：2019年第四季度的经济增长速度是6%，今年一季度的速度肯定要往下走。
One degree: As you said earlier, the epidemic will have a greater impact on economic indicators in the first quarter of this year.Do you have an estimate? JACKEN: The economy will grow by 6% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and the pace is sure to decline in the first quarter of this year.
当下对于全年的GDP来说，可以肯定的是，会出现前低后高的情况，但后高的势头如何，现在还不太好判断。
For the year as a whole, it is certain that there will be highs and lows, but it is not easy to judge how high the momentum will be.
具体影响多少，并没有非常精细的预估，因为信息有限，且经济生活中间的变量太复杂，一般都是做一个相对粗线条的预测，再阶段性地对预测做出修正。
The exact impact is not estimated in great detail because of limited information and the complexity of the variables in the middle of economic life, which is generally a relatively rough projection, followed by periodic revisions.
世行、亚行、国际货币基金组织都采取这个方式。
The World Bank, ADB and the International Monetary Fund have adopted this approach.
总体来说，如果处理得好，对于中国经济的影响应该在一季度能够收在下降一个百分点左右，对全年的影响也就是0.2-0.3个百分点，当然这是非常粗线条的说法。
Overall, if handled well, the impact on the Chinese economy should be about 1 percentage point lower in the first quarter and 0.2-0.3 percentage points in the whole year, which is very crude.
深一度：按照惯例，一些重大事件之后，政府都会出台相应的措施来刺激经济，在一季度经济指数不会太理想的情况下，您认为二季度政府是否会有一些刺激性的政策出台？贾康：现在已经在出台一些措施了，没有必要等二季度。
If the first quarter is not going to be ideal, do you think the government will have a stimulus policy in the second quarter? JACKEN: There are already some measures in place.
现在已经在财政政策方面提出了要更加积极有效，在货币政策方面要保持流动性合理充裕。
There is now a case for more aggressive and effective fiscal policy, with reasonably ample liquidity in monetary policy.
一些支持措施，都已经有所布置。
Some support measures have been put in place.
目前各级财政已经紧急安排疫情防控资金超过1000亿元，实际支出已经超400亿元，那么这对于经济来说可以起到对冲下行压力的作用，而剩下的部分也会较快花出去。
At present, the financial authorities at all levels have allocated over 100 billion yuan of funds for epidemic prevention and control, and the actual expenditure has exceeded 40 billion yuan.
深一度：去年年底召开的中央经济工作会议明确中提出，2020年中国经济工作中，继续实施积极的财政政策和稳健的货币政策。
One degree: The Central Economic Work Conference held at the end of last year made it clear that China will continue to implement an active fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy in its economic work in 2020.
是否会因为疫情的影响，财政政策的基调也发生相应的改变？贾康：“积极”的基调不会变，而且肯定会适当加码。
Will there be a corresponding change in the tone of fiscal policy as a result of the epidemic? JACKAN: The "positive" tone will not change, and will certainly increase appropriately.
目前超过1000亿元针对疫情防控的资金就是“加码”的内容之一，后续的一些政策，包括从现在往后的具体安排，很快就会看到相应的措施陆续出台。
More than 100 billion yuan is being spent on epidemic prevention and control as part of the "scaling-up," and follow-up policies, including specific arrangements from now on, will soon see measures put in place.
深一度：我们发现，最近一段时间，相比春节来说，菜价高了一些，是否意味着CPI一直在高位运行当中？贾康：实际上，在还没有出现疫情之前，猪肉供给不足就已经带动了CPI的上涨。
Once upon a time, we found that the price of vegetables has been higher than that of the Spring Festival, does that mean CPI has been running at a high levelJACKAN: Actually, the shortage of pork supply has driven the CPI up before the outbreak.
现在有了疫情，某些地方就表现得更加明显。
Now that there is an epidemic, it is even more evident in some places.
但这是结构性问题加上阶段性的因素，CPI一段时间上升之后会有回调。
But this is a structural problem coupled with a phased factor, with CPI going up for a while and then a correction.
目前看来，二三季度回调的可能性比较大。
At present, the second and third quarters of the correction is more likely.
具体来说，是因为前段市场上猪肉的短缺造成猪肉价格上涨，同时拉动一些替代品比如牛羊肉和禽蛋跟着上涨，看到这种结构性问题，政府已经采取了一系列措施，包括加大猪肉进口，以各种措施鼓励养猪场和农户增加存栏数，等过几个月生猪出栏了，市场供应就会缓解紧张局面，价位自然就能稳住和回调了。
To be specific, the government has taken a series of measures to deal with the structural problems caused by the shortage of pork on the previous market and the consequent rise in some substitutes such as beef, mutton and eggs.
这不是一个由于货币投放量过多造成的通胀问题，它具有非常明显的结构性成因，只要针对结构性的问题增加有效供给，问题就能得到解决。
This is not a problem of inflation caused by excessive currency exposure. It is very structural in nature, and the problem can be solved by increasing effective supply in response to structural problems.
车企也参与生产口罩部分行业疫情中产能扩张深一度：从目前的情况来说，在这次疫情当中，类似口罩、消毒液、防护服等行业其实并没有受到影响，反而产能还有所扩张，您怎么看？贾康：在面上来说的确如此，但这也主要是涉及少数的行业。
Companies are also involved in the expansion of capacity in parts of the mask industry: As things stand, industries like masks, disinfectants, protective clothing have not been affected in this epidemic, but on the contrary, capacity has expanded.
比如急需的抗疫物资，就得开足马力来生产。
For example, urgently needed anti-epidemic supplies have to be produced at full capacity.
只能说，这些行业内的企业碰到了突发的客观需要，可使产能充分被运用，那么在具体的财务表现上，肯定会有一些更好的收益。
It can only be said that enterprises in these industries encountered unexpected objective needs, so that the full use of production capacity, then in the specific financial performance, there will be some better returns.
深一度：此次疫情当中，不少原本是车企、房企的企业不仅在经营范围内添加了“口罩生产”，甚至迅速地买好机器和原料，开工生产了，您怎么看这种全民生产口罩的现象？疫情过后会不会出现产能过剩？贾康：企业生产口罩，也是为了适应现在的市场需要。
How do you feel about this kind of national production of face masks? Will there be overcapacity after the epidemic? JACANG: Companies are also making masks to meet current market demands.
有需求当然就应该生产。
Demand, of course, should be produced.
这是在救急，如果疫情过去，不再需要这么多口罩等防疫物资，那么企业会根据实际情况，来组织自己的生产运营动态优化。
This is emergency relief, if the epidemic past, no longer need so many masks and other epidemic prevention materials, then enterprises will be based on the actual situation, to organize their own production and operation dynamic optimization.
不过现在管理部门明确表示，如果是在诸如口罩、防护服、消毒液等这些方面有产能，那就应开足马力做，不要怕过剩。
But now management has made it clear that if you have the capacity in areas such as masks, protective clothing and disinfectant, do it at full capacity and don't be afraid of excess.
国家有储备制度，一旦疫情得到控制，多出来的那部分，国家会作为必要储备收购进来。
The country has a reserve system, and once the epidemic is under control, the state buys in as a necessary reserve.
有关管理部门的这种态度，就是为了减少企业关于产能过剩的顾虑。
The management's attitude is designed to allay concerns about overcapacity.
深一度：因为疫情的关系，不少人的生活方式发生了改变，春节之后，不少企业开始实行网上办公，一些商场、饭店也加大了线上推广力度，您觉得疫情之后什么行业会站上“风口”？贾康：线上能够更多调动潜力，跟原来线上线下的相结合并没有矛盾，特别是线上运行以后，不但可以挖掘潜力，甚至可以挖掘得更激进一些。
At one point: As a result of the epidemic, many people's lifestyles have changed. After the Spring Festival, many enterprises have started to carry out on-line office work, and some shopping malls and restaurants have stepped up their online promotion efforts.
不过我认为，疫情造成的“风口”应该并不多。
However, I believe that the "wind tunnel" caused by the outbreak should not be many.
比如这次疫情以后，大家应该会看重疫苗的生产，相关的重点物资应该有保证储备水平的产能，其他的行业大概就会回归正常，像在线购物、在线娱乐这种方式，现在因为疫情的缘故，在线的比重有所提升，在此之后，一些比较成功的经验，当然也会延续运用下去。
After the outbreak, for example, one should focus on vaccine production, the related key items should have guaranteed reserve capacity, and other industries would probably return to normal, such as online shopping and entertainment. Now that the epidemic has increased, some of the more successful experiences will of course continue.
疫情期间购房小程序上推出的“在线购房”服务房地产“稳中上行”可能性较大深一度：现在各种政策都在放开，大家最关注的房地产的政策是否也会有所松动呢？疫情之后，房地产行业会如何发展呢？贾康：房地产行业有其自己的发展规律，疫情过去后，还是会按照发展规律走。
The possibility of a "steady rise" in real estate is greater: are policies being liberalized and the real estate policy on which we are most concerned loosened? What will happen to the real estate industry in the wake of the epidemic? JACK: The real estate industry has its own laws, and it will follow the rules of development after the epidemic.
中国房地产这些年来，显著的特征是“冰火两重天”，这就是说，对于房地产业界来说，是明显分化的局面。
Over the years, China's real estate sector has been marked by "two fires," which means the property industry is clearly divided.
疫情过去以后，分化的特征还会继续。
After the epidemic is over, the characteristics of differentiation will continue.
但总体来说，房地产在前面一轮高点被“930新政”往下打压之后，大体已经运行到了阶段性的底部。
But overall, real estate in the previous round of highs by the "930 New Deal" down to suppress, has largely run to the bottom stage.
所以比较大的可能性是，疫情过去后，稳中上行的可能性会更大一些。
So it is more likely that after the outbreak is over, it will be more likely that it will rise steadily.
但对于房价来说，居于哪一线的城市、又在这类城市中的哪个具体地方、以及某一个城市中的哪个地段、属于哪种类型，都是要考虑的问题，需要具体分析才能得出相应的答案，仅看表面的成交均价，像是把姚明和潘长江放在一起考虑平均身高，意义不大。
But which city to live in, which specific part of the city, which part of a city, and which type of city are considered are all matters to be considered and require a specific analysis in order to arrive at a corresponding answer, based on the apparent average price, such as Yao Ming and Pan Changjiang together in the average height.
深一度：您觉得此次疫情对房地产行业、房地产企业来说会有什么样的影响？您怎么看打折、线上购房、无理由退房等房地产行业的自救措施？贾康：有些企业会受到一些阶段性的压力，特别是疫情来了以后，交易非常清淡，这对于企业来说，肯定都是不良影响。
How do you think this epidemic will affect the real estate industry, real estate enterprises? How do you think discount, online purchase, no reason to check out the real estate industry's self-help measures? JACKAN: Some enterprises will be subject to some periodic pressure, especially after the outbreak of the epidemic, very light trading, which is sure to have a negative impact on enterprises.
这个阶段过去以后，不少房企应该能够恢复正常。
After this phase, many housing enterprises should be able to return to normal.
当下注重线上购房，可能会起到吸引客户的一定作用，但这个作用也是有限的，完全靠网上购房肯定不行。
The current focus on online home purchase may play a role in attracting customers, but this role is also limited, relying solely on online housing is certainly not.
包括打折、线上购房、无理由退房等房企的优惠措施，的确可以吸引一部分购房者的注意，这样就能调动起一些人的兴趣，但一般人在感兴趣以后，还会在习惯之下，需要去现场看一下，然后再确定要不要购房，这样人心里才会踏实。
The discount, on-line purchase, no reason to check out, and other preferential measures can indeed attract some home buyers attention, so as to mobilize some interest, but after interest, will also be customary, need to go to the scene, and then determine whether to buy a house, so that people will feel secure.
当然不可否认的是线上这些措施有可能会引出一些交易，但仅仅线上看房后就能确定购房的人，应该不会太多。
There is no denying, of course, that these on-line measures may lead to some transactions, but not many people should be able to identify buyers simply by looking at their homes online.
如果前期能在网上解决的全部都在网上解决了，这对于企业和购房者来说，毕竟也是一件以服务优化促进交易的好事情。
If all that can be resolved online in the early days is resolved online, it is also a good thing for businesses and homebuyers to optimize services to facilitate transactions.
深一度：现在看来，疫情可能对于一季度房企的销售、回款、拿地等有诸多负面影响，那么您认为疫情对于房企的影响还有哪些方面？这种影响会持续多久？疫情之后，房地产市场是否会出现“井喷”呢？贾康：可以说，房地产是受这次疫情影响比较大的行业之一，特别是销售。
At one point: Now, it seems that the epidemic may have a lot of negative impact on the first quarter of housing sales, money, land, etc. So what do you think the impact of the epidemic on housing enterprises? How long will this impact last?
但各地全年受影响的情况要看疫情在当地结束的时间，目前来看，除湖北之外，其他地方的影响应该能较快消除。
But the year-round impact will depend on when the outbreak ends on the ground, and for now, with the exception of Hubei, the impact should be eliminated relatively quickly.
但对于房地产企业来说，春节大促销的机会肯定是丧失了。
But for the real estate enterprise, the Spring Festival promotion opportunity is definitely lost.
从最近几个月的成交均价来看，目前房地产市场有一点儿升温的迹象，但后期是否会出现“井喷式”的增长，短期内还看不出来，当然不排除某些地区、某些楼盘会有热销的局面。
In recent months from the average transaction price, there are signs of a slight warming of the real estate market, but later whether there will be "blowout" growth, not yet seen in the short term, of course not exclude certain areas, some property sales will be hot situation.
深一度：除了商品房，商业地产业也受到了一定的冲击，除了免租，企业还应该采取什么的措施自救呢？贾康：对于商业地产来说，各地方和企业应该因地制宜来制定相应的政策，不可一概而论。
At one point: in addition to commercial housing, the commercial real estate industry has also been affected by a certain impact, in addition to rent-free, enterprises should take measures to help themselves? JACANG: For commercial real estate, local and enterprise should tailor the corresponding policies to local conditions, can not be generalized.
因为商业地产和地段、商业活动地域等联系密切，各地方、各企业的情况千差万别。
Because the commercial real estate and the location, commercial activities and other areas are closely linked, the situation varies greatly from place to place.
但对于企业来说，如何将相关主体的卖点表现出来，如何吸引潜在的成交对象，是“定制化解决”的事情。
But for the enterprise, how to show the relevant subject's selling point, how to attract the potential transaction object, is the "customization solution" thing.
深一度：现在已经有多个三四线地方政府出台了购房补贴，您怎么看？贾康：相对一二线城市来说，三四线地方政府有操作空间，所以可以用这样的方式来给本地的经济繁荣加把劲。
How do you feel about it? JACK: Compared with the first- or second-tier cities, three or four-lane local governments have room to operate, so it can be used to boost the prosperity of the local economy.
但各个地方的情况差别很大，要根据各地的特点制定尽可能合理的制化的解决方案，因为并没有按统一的模式“套上”就能解决问题的可能性。
But the situation varies greatly from place to place, and the best possible institutionalized solutions have to be devised according to local characteristics, because there is no "one size fits all" solution to the problem.
2月7日，国务院就疫情防控相关财税政策和小微企业融资难问题举行新闻发布会地方政府应“定制化”形成复工方案深一度：此次疫情给中小微企业带来了很大的影响，地方政府也陆续出台一些政策，来帮助企业尽快复工复产，渡过难关，您认为这些政策是否应该延续下去，变成长期政策呢？贾康：就目前的情况来看，湖北之外的复工复产还会加快。
On February 7, the State Council held a press conference on the prevention and control of the epidemic and the financing difficulties of micro, small and micro enterprises. Local governments should "customize" their work programmes.
我看有统计数据称，国内制造业的500强，已经有了97%的复工率，这基本上就是完全复工了，那么随后，很多中型企业很快就会跟上。
I look at the statistics that show that the nation's top 500 manufacturers have been able to return to work at a rate of 97%, which is basically a return to full employment, and many medium-sized companies will soon follow.
对于更多小微企业来说，确实受到了比较大的影响，比如说交通不便，无法出行，或者隔离必须达到规定时间段等，特别是一些分散的家政服务、餐饮等行业，目前看复工的条件并不太好。
For more micro and small enterprises, it is true that the impact is more difficult, such as transportation difficulties, travel, or isolation must reach the required time period, especially some scattered domestic service, catering and other industries, the conditions are not good.
国家包括地方政府，已经出台了不少相关政策，如果能迅速执行，很快就会看到效果。
Countries, including local governments, have put in place a number of policies that, if implemented quickly, will soon show results.
比如有的地方为了鼓励农民工尽快回到工作岗位，给免了返程的路费。
For example, some places to encourage migrant workers to return to work as soon as possible, the return of the road fees.
免费是什么？按照字面的意思来理解，就是政府出钱给他买车票，或者报销车票，那么政府出的钱是哪来的呢？还是财政为后盾的资金。
free fare free fare free fare free fare free fare free fare free fare free fare free fare free fare, free fare, free fare, free fare, free fare
这在有些地方是非常明确的措施，比如珠三角、长三角这种增长极区域，首先就会用这种方法算大账，把复工的局面做得更积极有效。
This in some places is very clear-cut measures, such as the Pearl River Delta, the Yangtze River Delta region, the first to use this method to calculate large accounts, the situation back to work more active and effective.
说得更直白一点，就是把疫情耽误的时间往回抢，前低之后，只要有操作可能性，要迅速推高，让后高的势头更足一些。
To put it more bluntly, delay the epidemic back, and when it is possible to do so, quickly push up the momentum of the epidemic.
深一度：对于地方政府来说，是否需要针对每一个企业制定不同的政策？您觉得目前企业的复工复产还面临哪些问题？贾康：一个企业制定一个政策，很难完全做到，一个地方政府的辖区内有千千万万的小微企业，不可能针对每个企业都定制，一般来说，会首先在辖区内抓重点企业，再制定一些普惠的规定去扶助大量小微企业，当然，对于小微企业来说，普惠的规定很难照顾到方方面面的细节。
At one point, do you think it is necessary for local governments to formulate different policies for each enterprise? JACANG: What do you think are the problems in resuming production? JACKAN: A company has a policy and it is difficult to do it all.
对于复工复产过程中，一些企业紧缺口罩、消毒液等防控物资，目前看来很快就会得到缓解。
For the resumption of production process, some enterprises in need of masks, disinfectant and other prevention and control materials, it seems that will soon be alleviated.
从现在的报道来看，这些防控物资的产能都在迅速提高。
According to current reports, these control materials are rapidly improving the capacity of the production.
深一度：地方政府应该怎样去有序地组织企业复工复产？贾康：这个问题依然在各个地方不能一概而论。
Once upon a time: How should local governments organize their businesses to return to work in an orderly fashion? JACKAN: The problem can't be generalized everywhere.
我们特别强调供给侧改革，它的关键要领就是要在地方政府的辖区之内，定制化地形成高水平方案。
We place special emphasis on supply-side reform, the key to which is the customization of high-level programmes within the jurisdiction of local governments.
对于某一个企业来说，在他具体的活动范围之内，也要解决定制化方案的问题，不可能套用同样的模式。
It is not possible for an enterprise to apply the same model to solving the problem of customization within the scope of its specific activities.
这必须是根据具体情况做出的特定设计。
This must be a context-specific design.
当然，这个设计里面要处理的是很具体的一些结构性问题。
Of course, the design has to deal with a number of very specific structural issues.
所以不能一概而论，各个地方的情况有明显的区别，需要因地制宜来做出定制化解决方案。
Therefore, it is not possible to generalize, there are obvious differences between local contexts, and tailor-made solutions are needed.
此外，就是必须在把握安全系数的前提下，积极稳妥地推进复工复产。
In addition, it is necessary to grasp the safety factor under the premise of actively but surely to promote the resumption of work.
要密切跟踪信息，及时作出必要调整。
Keep close track of information and make necessary adjustments in a timely manner.
各个地方的管理上有松有紧，那么企业的管理者就一定要特别上心，一定要注意防范风险。
The management of each place has loose have tight, then the manager of the enterprise must pay special attention, must pay attention to guard against the risk.
深一度：很多地方政府出台的扶持政策当中，也包括了缴费、缴税的推后，这对于企业来说意味着什么？贾康：这当然是在减轻企业负担。
Once upon a time, many local governments have introduced support policies that also include the payment of fees and the postponement of taxes, what does this mean for the companiesJACKEN: It certainly reduces the burden on businesses.
比如五险一金可以推迟上缴，税收也不急于按照原来规定的时点来汇算清缴，同样也可以推后。
For example, five insurance a gold may defer to turn in, the tax also does not rush according to the original stipulated time point to settle the settlement, also may defer.
这就是要给企业一些宽松的待遇。
This is to give the enterprise some loose treatment.
毕竟疫情之下，大多数企业都遭受了一定的冲击，甚至有企业出现了经营困难，政府就是考虑到这一点，所以出台有关政策让企业能够在这段时间内宽松一些，至少先把疫情特殊阶段扛过去。
After all, the epidemic, most enterprises have suffered a certain impact, and even some enterprises have business difficulties, the Government is taking this into account, so we have put in place policies to allow enterprises to ease this period of time, at least to carry over the special phase of the epidemic.
深一度：现在一些地方的过度防控措施，是否会对复工产生影响？贾康：过度或者不过度，具体这个度很难把握。
Once upon a time, will the over-prevention and control measures in some places have an impact on the resumption of workJACK: Too much or not too much.
有些地方必须把安全系数提高。
The safety factor must be increased in some places.
拿北京来说，春节之后，大概有七八百万人会返京，所以政府就要求，外地回京要自行隔离14天，发现某些地方出了问题后，所有相关者都必须马上隔离起来。
In Beijing, for example, about 78 million people will return to Beijing after the Spring Festival, so the government has demanded that outsiders go back to Beijing to isolate themselves for 14 days.
但局部的某些做法上，很容易出现一些比较过分的情况，比如在具体执行环节上简单粗暴，挖断道路，甚至戴个袖箍就打人，希望能在地方管理上更多注意，避免产生力度过大、过头和简单粗暴的行为，避免产生不良案例。
However, in some local practices, it is easy to go too far, such as simple and rude execution, cutting off roads and even beating people with sleeves, in the hope that more attention will be paid to local management and that excessive, excessive and gross behaviour will be avoided and undesirable cases avoided.
深一度：2月20日，湖北省发行了近百亿元的地方债，在即将到来的3月，地方债可能会进入密集发行区了，对此您怎么看？贾康：有关地方债的发行，是原来就已经布置好的，并不是疫情造成。
At one point: Hubei Province issued nearly 10 billion yuan of local debt on Feb. 20, and local debt is likely to enter an intensive issuing area in the coming March.
但是，疫情来了以后，地方债发行的速度可能会加快，力度上也可能要加码。
However, after the outbreak, the rate of issuance of local debt is likely to accelerate and possibly increase.
因为地方政府筹集资金的专项债，都是有明确用途的。
Because the local government raised funds of the special debt, are clear-cut purpose.
发行的时候就已经看准了政府项目，然后用专项债来筹集资金，但现在这个进度应该是能快则快，地方债加快发行也正是刺激经济的一种表现。
Government programs were targeted at the time of issuance, and funds were raised with special-purpose debt, but the pace should now be fast, and the acceleration of local debt issuance is one way to stimulate the economy.
