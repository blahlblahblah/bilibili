3月14日，海外网援引外媒报道称，西班牙政府已起草一项法令，将进行全国范围内的封锁。
On March 14, the Overseas Web site quoted foreign media reports that the Spanish government had drafted a decree that would impose a nationwide embargo.
这是该国为抗击新冠肺炎疫情而采取的紧急措施。
This is the country's emergency response to the outbreak of pneumonia in the New Crown.
根据法令要求，西班牙人除了购买食物或医疗用品、去医院、工作或处理其他紧急情况之外，要待在家里。
Spaniards are required by law to stay at home, in addition to purchasing food or medical supplies, going to hospitals, working or dealing with other emergencies.
该措施将于3月16日上午8点生效。
The measure will enter into force at 8 a.m. on 16 March.
目前，西班牙累计新冠肺炎确诊病例5753例，报告死亡病例136例，治愈出院517例。
At present, Spain has a cumulative total of 5,753 confirmed cases of pneumonia, 136 deaths reported and 517 cases cured.
13日，西班牙首相佩德罗·桑切斯宣布西班牙进入国家紧急状态（图片来源：新闻联播）随着疫情形势越发严峻，西班牙此番动作，可以说是欧洲严阵以待的一个缩影。
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez declared a state of emergency on Thursday, a move that epitomizes Europe's readiness as the epidemic deepens.
然而，身在“震中”的部分欧洲国家却只是采取了一些轻描淡写的措施，不仅让本国国民焦虑，也让全球网友揪心。
However, some European countries at the "epicentre" have taken only light-hearted measures, worrying not only their own citizens, but also global netizens.
世卫组织：任何国家不应自暴自弃！网友：瑞典英国听到没据@中国新闻网消息，世卫组织发言人亚沙雷维奇接受央视主持人田薇专访时强调，任何国家都不能把“无力回天”当借口，自暴自弃。
WHO: No country should abandon itself on its own.http: / / www.youtheme.cn WHO spokesman Jasharevich told CCTV host Tian Weiwei that no country can afford to abandon itself on the pretext of being powerless to recover.
他明确表示，现在不是相互指责的时候，而是救命的时候。
He made it clear that this was not a time for recrimination but a time for saving lives.
“任何国家都不应该放弃努力（let it go），不能自暴自弃（give up)。
"No country should give up its efforts or abandon itself."
不能说已经这样了，那就等着感染病毒吧。
I can't say it's over, so wait for the virus to infect.
”亚沙雷维奇说。
'he said.
他表示，不少国家正在经历中国此前经受过的考验，中国、韩国、新加坡等国的方法，他国可以参考。
Many countries are going through the trials that China has undergone before, he said. China, South Korea and Singapore are examples of approaches that other countries can refer to.
“不要忘了中国、韩国和新加坡等国所取得的防控成果。
"Don't forget the results of prevention and control in countries such as China, South Korea and Singapore.
这些国家已经使用了非常基本，但也强有力的流行病学监测，找到被感染的人，对他们进行测试和治疗，寻找他们的亲密接触者，通过这种努力减缓甚至彻底截断传播链。
These countries have used very basic, but also robust, epidemiological surveillance to locate infected people, test and treat them, find their close contacts and slow down or even completely sever the transmission chain through such efforts.
”Play听到亚沙雷维奇的这番话，不少网友开始纷纷“喊话”瑞典和英国。
Play heard Yashorevic's comments and many netizens began "shouting" Sweden and Britain.
为什么是瑞典和英国？这还要从两国应对新冠肺炎疫情的“谜之操作”说起。
Why are Sweden and the UK? This begins with the two countries "response to the" mystery of "the outbreak of pneumonia.
瑞典：停止病例统计，缩小检测范围据环球时报，瑞典官方12日决定停止对新冠肺炎确诊病例的统计，该国也将不再对轻症患者和疑似患者进行检测。
Sweden to cut back on confirmed cases of pneumonia Sweden will no longer test people with mild cases or suspected cases, the Global Times said.
斯德哥尔摩的一名官员表示，已经没有可能阻止新冠疫情在瑞典的传播。
A Stockholm official said it was no longer possible to stop the spread of the new crown in Sweden.
该国公共卫生局则称，将把有限的资源用于医护人员、已住院患者等高危人群。
The Office of Public Health said limited resources would be allocated to high-risk groups such as health-care workers and hospitalized patients.
瑞典首都斯德哥尔摩新闻处发言人埃里克·伯格隆德11日深夜表示，斯德哥尔摩地区正在减少新冠病毒检测人数，从12日起，对于怀疑自己感染新冠病毒的人停止检测，只对已入院者和高危人群进行抽样。
Stockholm area is reducing the number of people tested for the new crown virus and starting from 12, people who suspect they are infected with the new crown virus will be stopped and only admitted and high-risk groups will be sampled, a spokesman for the Stockholm Information Service said late at night.
据瑞典《每日新闻报》12日报道，斯德哥尔摩官方称，以前大范围检测太耗费资源，政府没有能力对每个确诊病例进行追踪，现在医疗系统需要投入更多资源保护弱者，完全控制新冠病毒传播的可能性已不复存在。
Stockholm officials said widespread testing had previously been too resource-intensive, that the government did not have the capacity to track every confirmed case, and that the system now needed more resources to protect the weak and the possibility of full control of the virus no longer existed, the Daily News reported.
伯格隆德在新闻发布会上说：“我们已经改变策略，不再尝试检测每个人。
"We have changed strategy and stopped trying to test everyone," Bergglund said at a news conference.
如果你年轻力壮，即使有新冠肺炎感染症状，我们也将不再检测。
If you are young and strong, even if you have symptoms of pneumonia in the new crown, we will no longer test.
无论你是去过高危地区，还是曾与确诊患者密切接触，请等待症状发作和消退。
Whether you have been to a high-risk area or have been in close contact with a confirmed patient, wait for symptoms to break out and subside.
”不过，另一方面，对老人和高危人群的检测仍将继续，以免他们在医疗体系中传播病毒。
On the other hand, testing for the elderly and high-risk groups will continue to prevent them from spreading the virus through the health-care system.
英国：让老百姓感染病毒从而获得免疫？英国政府应对新冠肺炎疫情的举动，也引发了巨大争议，因为他们对付新冠病毒的杀手锏，竟然是让老百姓去感染病毒，从而让绝大多数人都获得免疫，这样就不再怕病毒了……尽管这听起来令人觉得难以置信，但根据美国彭博社的报道，这似乎就是英国政府接下来应对新冠病毒疫情的杀手锏。
Britain: Immune the common people with the virus? The British government's response to the Crown Pneumonia epidemic has also caused a great deal of controversy, because their weapon against the new Crown Virus is to immunize most people against the virus.
当地时间3月12日，英国政府宣布，该国疫情应对措施从“遏制”阶段进入“延缓”阶段，进一步提升力度。
The British government announced March 12, the country's response to the epidemic from the "containment" phase into a "delay" phase, further enhanced.
（图片来源：新华社英国首相府供图）在一篇名为“鲍里斯·约翰逊的英国病毒防疫策略，是让人们都去感染病毒”的报道中，彭博社表示：虽然约翰逊的政府没有明着说出“让所有人都去得病”这句话，但他们策略中的这个意图已经很明显了，即要放缓病毒的传播，但并不是去完全控制这个病毒，让人们在今年夏季慢慢地去感染，然后逐渐康复，进而在冬天之前达到“人群免疫”的目标。
(Source: Office of the British Prime Minister Xinhua) In a report entitled "Boris Johnson's UK Virus Vaccination Strategy, Let People Get Infected," Bloomberg said: Although Johnson's administration did not explicitly say, "Let everyone get sick," the intent was clear: slow the spread of the virus, slowly infect people this summer and then gradually recover before winter.
彭博社报道截图彭博社还引用英国政府首席科技顾问帕德里克·瓦伦斯的说法称，冬季是英国医疗系统最脆弱的时候，如果病毒于2020年底的冬天再次袭来，就会产生额外的问题。
Bloomberg quoted Parderek Varens, chief technology adviser to the British government, as saying that winter was the weakest period in the British health system and that additional problems would arise if the virus struck again in late 2020.
所以，从他的说法来看，英国政府采取这种策略的原因，是趁着春天到来，天气回暖，让英国人在冬天之前都获得对病毒免疫的能力，这样到了2020年底冬季如果疫情再出现就不怕了。
So, in his view, the British government's strategy is to take advantage of the spring to warm up and give the British the ability to immunize against the virus before winter, so that by the end of 2020 there will be no fear of a recurrence of the disease.
“英国无法完全压制疫情，也不该完全压制疫情”，瓦伦斯说。
"Britain cannot suppress the epidemic completely, nor should it suppress it completely," Vallance said.
英国科技媒体Wired UK也在一篇报道中，通过引述英国BBC和ITV等媒体对于英国政府顾问的采访和报道，认为英国政府对于新冠病毒疫情的杀手锏，就是通过让足够多的人感染病毒并康复过来，来实现“人群免疫”。
In a separate report, Wired UK, the British technology media, quoted BBC and ITV as saying that the British government's weapon against the Crown Virus epidemic was to immunize people by getting enough people to get infected and recover.
不过，这家媒体却认为英国政府的这种策略问题很大，甚至会造成严重的后果：实现人群免疫，至少需要一半的英国人口感染这种病毒，尽管80%的感染者是轻症，这却仍会令剩下的600多万人处于重症的风险之下，而且中国的研究还发现5%的感染者会出现病危的症状，比如呼吸衰竭、器官衰竭等等。
The media, however, said the British government's strategy was highly problematic and could have serious consequences: immunization would require at least half of the UK population to acquire the virus, although 80 per cent of the infected would still put the remaining 6 million at serious risk, and Chinese studies found that 5 per cent of those infected were critically ill, such as respiratory failure, organ failure and so on.
报道还认为，即便提出这种策略的人表示他们会保护高危人群不被感染，这种策略仍然会给英国的医疗系统带来巨大的压力。
Even if those who propose such a strategy say they will protect high-risk populations from infection, the report said, the strategy will continue to put enormous strain on Britain's health-care system.
Wired UK报道截图言辞更激烈的是国际权威医学期刊《柳叶刀》主编Richard Horton，称英国政府的决策并不是依据科学做出的，而是在拿公众的安危玩“轮盘赌注”，是个重大的错误。
More strikingly, Richard Horton, editor of The Lancet, a leading international medical journal, said the British government's decision was not based on science, but rather a "roulette" on the safety of the public.
部分英国网友在从媒体上得知政府这一“群体免疫”的政策后，也感到不解、震惊和愤怒。
Some British netizens also felt perplexed, shocked and angry when they learned about the government's "mass immunization" policy from the media.
有网民表示，明明采取中国、韩国等其他地方的措施就可以控制住病毒，为啥还要搞这种人群免疫？有网民还担心说，如果这种病毒像流感病毒一样，每年都会在人群中发生进一步变异，怎么办？还有网民表示，群体免疫需要90%的人感染病毒并生存下来，而新冠病毒的致死率是2%到4%，这也就意味着为了在英国实现这个目标得牺牲大约120万人。
Some netizens said the virus could be contained by other measures such as China and South Korea.Some netizens also worry that if the virus mutates further through the population every year like the flu virus, others say it needs 90% of people to get infected and survive, compared with 2% to 4% for the new strain, meaning about 1.2 million people would have to die to achieve the goal in the UK.
据人民日报客户端，3月14日，英国新增新冠肺炎感染者342人，确诊总数达1140人。
On March 14, 342 new cases of pneumonia were reported in the UK, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 1,140, the People's Daily said.
在过去的24小时内，有10名新冠肺炎感染者死亡，使得英国新冠肺炎感染者死亡人数上升至21人。
In the past 24 hours, 10 new cases of pneumonia have died, raising the death toll from pneumonia to 21.
目前，英国政府已禁止500人以上的大规模集会，但尚未关闭学校。
The British government has banned large gatherings of more than 500 people but has yet to close schools.
欧洲为何成了疫情“震中”？“雪崩之前，每一片雪花都在勇闯天涯”全球疫情形势发生了一个重大变化。
Why did Europe become the epicentre of the epidemic? Before the avalanche, every snowflake was breaking through the horizon.
世界卫生组织秘书长谭德塞13日说，欧洲已成为新冠肺炎“大流行”的“震中”。
World Health Organization Secretary-General Lindsay 13, Europe has become the "new crown pneumonia pandemic" of the "epicenter."
目前欧洲报告的新冠肺炎确诊和死亡病例超过中国以外其他国家和地区的总和，每天报告的病例比中国疫情流行高峰时还要多。
Europe now reports more cases of confirmed cases of pneumonia and deaths than countries and regions other than China combined, with more cases reported each day than at the peak of the epidemic in China.
数据截至3月14日21:31截自世卫组织3月13日报告微信公众号“国是直通车”指出，欧洲疫情之所以亮起红灯，很大程度上是因为“轻敌”。
Figures released March 14, 21: 31, from the World Health Organization report MicroSky Public "through train" points out that the European outbreak of red light, in large part because of "light enemies.
网上有一句话，挺形象：雪崩之前，每一片雪花都在勇闯天涯。
There is a sentence on the Internet, quite image: Avalanche before, each snowflake is brave in the horizon.
疫情“埋伏”期间，意大利伊夫雷亚一年一度的“橘子大战”依旧照常举行，约15000人参加了狂欢，当然是不戴口罩的；法国不少大型活动还在按计划举行，包括2020年法国国际农业博览会、法国国民议会（议会下院）会议活动、全法大规模抗议游行等，大多数参与者不戴口罩。
During the "ambush," the annual "Orange Wars" in Iverea, Italy, continued, with some 15,000 revelers, of course, wearing no face masks; and a number of major French events were held as planned, including the 2020 France International Agricultural Fair, the French National Assembly (lower house of parliament) meeting, and the French-wide mass protest march.
虽然政府已呼吁民众尽量避免握手，部分地区也对贴面礼提出警告，但调查显示大部分法国民众还是该握手握手，该贴面贴面……欧洲国家自己也承认这一点。
Although the government has appealed to people to avoid shaking hands and some parts of the country have warned against the veneer, surveys show that most French people should shake hands and shake hands, and the veneer itself acknowledges it.
欧盟成员国国家元首前几天专门开了一个视频会议，对应对疫情的不力现状进行了反思。
The heads of state of EU member states held a special videoconference the other day to reflect on the weak response to the epidemic.
距离欧洲首例确诊病例出现已经过去40多天了，但区域内各成员国连对防护物资库存、需求与生产能力进行评估这个最基本的事情都没做完。
More than 40 days after the first confirmed case in Europe, the most basic task of assessing stocks of protective equipment, needs and production capacity has not been completed by member States in the region.
目前看来，欧洲的应对模式分为两种：一种核心是“堵”，以意大利、西班牙为代表。
For now, Europe's response model is divided into two categories: one core is "plugging," with Italy and Spain as its representatives.
意大利已在全国范围内实施“封城”，并关闭了除食品店和药店以外的所有店铺，这是二战以来，意大利第一次动用这么强硬的手段限制民众自由活动。
Italy has imposed a nationwide "cordon sanitaire" and closed all shops except food stores and pharmacies, the first time since World War II that Italy has used such a tough approach to restrict people's freedom of movement.
此外，意大利还在几天时间里搭建了近300个医疗帐篷，供患者进入医院前先进行初步检查，避免疑似患者与普通患者和医护人员产生交叉感染。
In addition, Italy has built nearly 300 medical tents over a period of a few days for patients to undergo preliminary examinations prior to admission to hospitals in order to avoid cross-infection between suspected patients and general and medical personnel.
如文章一开始所述，西班牙也已行动起来。
As stated at the beginning of the article, Spain has also taken action.
另一种重点在“疏”，以德国为代表。
The other focus is on "sparse," represented by Germany.
德国总理默克尔说，由于当前既无疫苗、亦无特效药，假如这种情形一直持续下去，根据此前的大传染病暴发的经验，专家估计德国最高可能达到60%-70%的人口被感染。
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that if the situation continues, experts estimate that up to 60-70 per cent of the population in Germany could be infected, based on previous experience with pandemics, since neither vaccines nor specific drugs are currently available.
现在的重点是要争取时间，让德国医疗体系不至于超负荷而崩溃。
The focus now is on buying time to keep Germany's health-care system from collapsing.
有分析人士认为，这番话透露了德国面对新冠病毒的态度：不绝对扑杀、也不完全放任，先将“大流行不可阻挡”作为前提，再考虑如何延缓病毒传播的速度，给卫生部门和医疗机构争取时间。
Analysts said the comments revealed Germany's attitude toward the new crown virus: do not absolutely kill, not completely laissez-faire, "pandemic can not be blocked" as the premise, and then consider how to slow down the spread of the virus, health and medical institutions to buy time.
用德国“钟南山”的话说，就是要尝试通过“有针对性的、在我们的社会中可实施和可承受、经济上也可行的措施”进行控制，以便在成本效益比较合适的情况下进行干预，来尝试延迟病毒的大面积传播发生，“即使仅延迟几周也是非常好的”。
In the words of Germany's "Zhong Nan Shan," it is an attempt to control "targeted, affordable, and economically viable measures in our society" in order to intervene where it is more cost-effective to try to delay widespread transmission of the virus, "even with a few weeks delay."
这两种做法哪个更好？现在还不得而知。
Which of these two approaches is better is not known.
但有一点可以肯定：不管哪种做法，都要适合各自的政治体制、社会习惯和国情，都要和疫情形势相称。
But one thing is certain: either approach should be appropriate to the political system, social habits, and national conditions, as well as to the epidemic situation.
适合自己的，就是最好的。
What suits you is the best.
根据不同国情各自“配方抓药”无可厚非，但是，这客观上给欧洲团结合作应对疫情加大了难度。
There is no denying that each country has its own "recipe," but this objectively makes it more difficult for Europe to work together to address the epidemic.
比如，在边界管控、区域隔离等问题上，欧洲国家的态度就存在明显差异。
For example, when it comes to border controls, regional isolation, and so on, European attitudes differ markedly.
部分国家主张”严防死守“，如与意大利接壤的奥地利已宣布管控来自意大利的旅客进入其国土，斯洛文尼亚也决定关闭意大利的边界，西班牙暂时切断与意大利的交通联系……但也有国家比较“佛系”，法国总统马克龙就认为这类做法是“不适当的决定”，并表示不会关闭法意边界。
Some countries advocate "strict precautions," such as Austria, which borders Italy, has announced controls on the entry of tourists from Italy, Slovenia has decided to close Italy's borders, and Spain has temporarily cut off communication with Italy... but others are more "Buddhist," which French President Marc Ronny described as "inappropriate" and said they would not close the Franco-Italian border.
针对国内会导致人员大规模聚集的活动，各国做法也不一致。
State practice is also inconsistent with regard to domestic activities that lead to large-scale population concentrations.
法国禁止百人以上集会，但还要坚持举行市政选举；意大利、奥地利、捷克、丹麦、爱尔兰和挪威等国都已宣布学校全面停课，但德国只有个别几个州计划暂时关闭幼儿园及中小学。
France bans gatherings of more than 100 people but insists on holding municipal elections; Italy, Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Ireland and Norway have all declared schools closed, but only a few German states plan to close kindergartens and schools temporarily.
此外，在如何对冲疫情给经济造成的影响上，各国也有分歧。
In addition, countries differ on how to hedge the economic impact of the epidemic.
欧盟委员会主席冯德莱恩之前表示，将“动用所有可以利用的工具”确保欧洲经济平安度过疫情风暴”，并承诺将在宏观经济层面采取行动，部署行业援助计划，提前规避疫情可能造成的经济混乱局面。
European Commission President von der Lehn had previously said he would "use all the tools at his disposal" to ensure that Europe's economy weathered the storm safely, and promised to take action at the macro-economic level to deploy an industry aid program to avert the economic chaos that the outbreak could cause.
但在怎么援助这个问题上，成员国又各有各的算盘。
But on the question of how to assist, member states have their own agendas.
法国希望采取统一协调的财政刺激措施，给企业更大支持；德国则对加大公共支出等刺激措施表现出一贯的谨慎态度。
France wants a coordinated fiscal stimulus and greater support for business; Germany has been consistently cautious about increasing incentives, such as public spending.
欧洲国家从来就不是“铁板一块”，“各有各的理、各干各的事”一直是欧洲推动重大议题时躲不开的拦路虎。
European countries have never been "monolithic," and "each has his or her own business" has been a constant stumbling block in the push for major issues in Europe.
疫情之下，这个矛盾不仅没有解决，反而被进一步放大了。
Under the epidemic, this contradiction has not been resolved, but has been further amplified.
“国是直通车”认为，接下来的几周，欧盟面临的主要任务不仅是做好现有病例的诊断救治，更重要的是高效动员、配置人力物力资源，团结一致遏制疫情蔓延势头。
In the coming weeks, the EU will have to focus not only on diagnosing and treating existing cases, but also on mobilizing and allocating human and material resources efficiently and acting in unison to halt the spread of the epidemic.
这是块很难啃，但必须啃的“硬骨头”。
This is a hard nut to crack, but a hard nut to crack.
毕竟，团结就是力量。
After all, unity is strength.
毕竟，“震中”不尽快稳定下来，这场全球性的“巨震”就很难平息。
After all, the "epicentre" will not stabilize as soon as possible, and the global "earthquake" will be difficult to quell.
