“病理诊断是疾病诊断的金标准”2月16日凌晨3点50分，全国首例新冠病毒肺炎患者遗体解剖工作在武汉市金银潭医院顺利结束，由华中科技大学同济医学院法医病理学教授刘良及其团队完成，14小时后，他们又完成了第二例遗体解剖工作。
"Pathological diagnosis is the gold standard for disease diagnosis." At 3: 50 am on Feb. 16, the autopsy of the body of the nation's first case of Newcastle virus pneumonia was successfully completed by Liu Liang and his team, a forensic pathologist at Tongji Medical School, Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
目前，两具解剖病理已被送检，以期揭示新冠病毒发病机制、病理特征及其相关临床之间的关联，这份备受期待的报告预计在10天后出炉。
At present, two autopsy pathologies have been submitted for examination to reveal the association between the pathogenesis, pathologic features and associated clinical manifestations of the new crown virus. The much-anticipated report is expected in 10 days.
“第一例遗体解剖的肺部结果已经出来了，可以看到肺部有渗出、变质的变化，但还需要更多资料来综合判断病理情况。
"The results of the first autopsy of the lung have come out and you can see changes in the lungs that are seeping and degenerating," he said.
”中国病理学专家、南方医科大学病理学教授丁彦青对《中国新闻周刊》说，他的团队曾在2003年抗击非典（SARS）期间完成世界首例SARS患者尸体解剖。
Ding Yanqing, a Chinese pathologist and professor of pathology at the Southern Medical University, told China News Weekly that his team had performed the world's first autopsy of a SARS patient during the fight against SARS in 2003.
“我们还在继续工作中，需要集中精力。
"We are still working and need to concentrate.
”18日上午10时许，刘良在个人媒体账号上发文“谢绝采访和打扰。
At about 10 a.m. on the 18th, Liu posted a message on his personal media account, "No more interviews and no interruptions.
”此前他在接受《健康时报》采访时表示，2 月 16 日的解剖工作主要是取材，“病毒要灭活，所以取材的组织要多泡一下。
Earlier, in an interview with the Health Times, he said the autopsy on Feb. 16 was based on "the virus being inactivated, so the tissue from which it was taken would need to be soaked."
接下来会将切片放到显微镜下观察，看它的细胞结构，组织结构有什么样的变化。
The slice is then placed under a microscope to see what changes in the cell structure and tissue structure are made.
”有关新冠病毒感染和 SARS 的异同，刘良表示需要后续显微镜下以及病理、病毒学的研究。
Regarding the similarities and differences between the new crown virus infection and SARS, Liu said follow-up microscopy and studies of pathology and virology were needed.
18小时连续解剖两例遗体2月15日晚9点，正在等待回复的刘良突然接到武汉市金银潭医院院长张定宇的电话，“有一个可以做解剖的了。
18-hour autopsy of two human remains February 15 evening at 9: 00 pm, Liu Liang is waiting for a reply when he suddenly received a call from Zhang Dingyu, director of the gold and silver pool hospital in Wuhan.
”事后刘良回忆道，“国家、省市卫健委打破常规，先行动，然后下正式文”。
"After Liu Liang recalled," the state, provincial and municipal health committees break the routine, first action, then under the official text. "
此前一天，刘良在个人媒体平台上“呼吁尽快开展新冠肺炎死亡个体尸体检验”，15日上午11点，刘良收到了国家卫生健康委员会医政医管局回复，获邀参加新冠肺炎病死病例尸检相关事宜会议，当时他“乐观估计尸检落地还需要2-3天”。
Liu, who on his personal media platform "called for an immediate autopsy of the dead from pneumonia," received a reply from the State Council of Health at 11: 00 a.m. and was invited to attend a post-mortem meeting on the death of Newcrown Pneumonia, when he was "optimistic that an autopsy will take another two to three days."
通知比预想来得更早，刘良紧急安排团队人员从武汉市各个角落汇集到医院。
The notice came earlier than expected, and Liu urgently arranged for the team to gather from all corners of Wuhan city to the hospital.
与此同时，金银潭医院专门腾出了一间负压洁净手术室，确保解剖的同时不让病毒扩散。
At the same time, the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital has set aside a negative pressure to clean the operating room to ensure anatomy while keeping the virus from spreading.
“这次尸检得以这么快进行，得益于家属的同意，我们尸检前专门为他（她）们默哀。
"We observed a moment of silence for him or her before the autopsy, thanks to the agreement of the family," he said.
”刘良写道。
"he wrote.
这两例患者都出自上海医疗队管辖的病区。
Both cases came from the area under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai medical team.
第一批上海援鄂医疗队是最早达到武汉的省队之一，对口支援金银潭医院，医疗队领队、上海市第一人民医院副院长郑军华介绍，即使在治疗过程中使用了人工肝、人工肾、ECMO等最先进手段，仍有一部分患者抢救困难、不幸去世，了解发病机制对一线治疗至关重要，亟待尸检报告的出现。
The first batch of medical teams from Shanghai to Hubei was one of the first provincial teams to reach Wuhan. The team leader of the team and Vice-President of the Shanghai First People's Hospital Zheng Junhua said that even though some patients were treated with the most advanced methods, such as artificial liver, artificial kidney and ECMO.
此次首例被解剖患者过世之后，郑军华团队经过两个多小时的沟通，家属在了解解剖意义后忍痛签下同意书。
After the death of the first autopsy patient, Zhengjunhua's team had been communicating for more than two hours and the family signed a consent form after learning the anatomy.
出于对死者和家属隐私的保护，郑军华只透露了两位过世患者都超过了55岁。
Out of concern for the privacy of the deceased and his family, Zheng Junhua disclosed only that both deceased patients were over 55 years old.
穿着令人呼吸困难的防护服等到凌晨1点多，刘良团队开始尸检，3点50分，首例尸检工作顺利结束。
Dressed in breathless protective clothing until more than 1 a.m., Liu's team began an autopsy, 3: 50 pm, the first autopsy successfully concluded.
“终于知道隔离防护服的厉害了。
"Finally I know that the protective clothing is strong.
穿上不到10分钟，满头大汗，结果在干平时轻松可以干的活时，汗如雨下，呼吸困难，眼镜护目镜朦胧一片。
Wear less than 10 minutes, sweaty head, the result in the usual easy to do work, sweat, breathing difficulties, glasses hazy one.
像高原反应一样，第一例做到大半截，出现心慌头晕低血糖表现。
Like the plateau reaction, the first case achieved a large part of the dizziness, dizziness and hypoglycemia.
一方面说明自己确实老了。
On the one hand, he is really old.
但真的体会到医护人员的艰辛和付出。
But I really appreciate the hardship and dedication of the medical staff.
必须要向所有普普通通的一线医护战士致敬！”刘良在自己的个人媒体平台上写道。
We must pay tribute to all the mediocre frontline medical fighters, "Liu wrote on his personal media platform.
第一例尸检结束后，刘良回家隔离休息2个多小时后，马上和团队成员总结并上报了尸检流程上可以改善的问题。
After the first autopsy, Liu Liang went home to rest in isolation for more than 2 hours.
16日上午11时许，刘良再次接到金银潭医院院长张定宇通知，“又有一例需要尸检。
At about 11: 00 a.m. on the 16th, Liu Liang received another notification from Zhang Dingyu, director of the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital.
”急招队员，再次赶赴医院，当天下午4点开始解剖，6点半结束时，“浑身湿透”的刘良倍感寒冷，马上回家再次自我隔离，并记录下连续工作18小时的经过。
"The group rushed to the hospital again, where the autopsy began at 4 p.m., and at 6: 30 a.m. Liu Liang, who was" wet through, "felt cold and went home again, recording 18 hours of continuous work.
病理诊断是疾病诊断的金标准刘良发出文字呼吁的当天，全国已经有累计确诊63946例，其中1382人死亡。
Pathological diagnosis is the gold standard for disease diagnosis Liu Liang issued a written appeal, the cumulative number of diagnosed 63,946 cases, of which 1,382 died.
新冠肺炎重症患者临床表现与2003年SARS相比，病情进展更快，部分病人缺氧发展明显，心脏损伤严重，但当时还没有对死亡个体开展系统性实体解剖及病理学检验。
Compared with SARS in 2003, the clinical manifestations of severe cases of Newcomial Pneumonia were faster than that of SARS in 2003. Some patients suffered from hypoxia.
“临床上如果想更好地治疗这些重症、危重症患者，需要对发病机制、患者身体状况有更多了解，这需要基础研究跟上，就是尸检和病理报告。
"If we want to treat these severe and critical patients better, we need to know more about the pathogenesis and physical condition of patients, which requires basic research, namely autopsy and pathology reports.
”武汉市肺科医院ICU主任胡明接受《中国新闻周刊》采访时说。
Hu Ming, director of the ICU at Wuhan Lung Hospital, told China News Weekly.
2003年SARS爆发后，病原体最初被认为是破坏力并不大的“衣原体”，但患者病情重、死亡率高，应用抗生素无效。
After the SARS outbreak in 2003, the pathogen was initially thought to be the less destructive chlamydia, but the patient was seriously ill, had a high mortality rate, and was ineffective with antibiotics.
南方医科大学病理学教授丁彦青完成首例SARS死者解剖后，结合当时在南方医院进行的4例尸检结果，综合判断病原体应为“病毒”，这为非典治疗提供了重要科学依据。
Ding Yanqing, a professor of pathology at Southern Medical University, after completing the first autopsy of SARS, combined with the results of 4 autopsies conducted at the Southern Hospital at that time, comprehensively judged that the pathogen should be "virus," which provided an important scientific basis for SARS treatment.
“病理诊断是疾病诊断的金标准。
"Pathological diagnosis is the gold standard for disease diagnosis.
”丁彦青对《中国新闻周刊》说，病理学界内部早在春节前后就开始在微信朋友圈呼吁“做病例尸检”。
Ding told China News Weekly that the pathology community had been calling for "post-mortem examinations" in Weixin's circle of friends as early as around the Spring Festival.
1月29日，中国科学院院士、陆军军医大学病理研究所所长卞修武就向中国疾病预防控制中心发出了《关于开展新型冠状病毒感染死亡病例尸检工作的建议》，当天国家卫健委通报全国确诊病例7711例，累计死亡170例。
On January 29, 2007, Bian Xiuwu, academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and director of the Institute of Pathology of the Army Medical University, issued recommendations to the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on the conduct of autopsy of death cases of coronavirus infection.
新冠病毒肺炎在临床治疗过程中有许多问题还未得到科学解释。
There are many problems in clinical treatment of new crown virus pneumonia which have not been scientifically explained.
为什么上呼吸道病毒检测阳性远低于下呼吸道？患者肺部“磨玻璃样”病理学改变与其他的病毒性肺炎有何异同？后期病情进展迅速的原因和机制是什么？“关于后期病情进展迅速、心脏受损严重，我和卞修武院士讨论过，参照SARS的病理结果，可能是细胞因子风暴引起的。
Why is the upper respiratory virus positive much lower than the lower respiratory tract? What are the differences and similarities between the pathologic changes of the "ground glass-like" lung and other viral pneumonia? What are the causes and mechanisms of the rapid progression of the disease in the latter stages?
”丁彦青解释说，2003年他首次在英国《病理学杂志》上提出“肺和免疫器官是SARS病毒攻击的主要靶器官”，2006年再发表“SARS发病免疫病理机制研究”，提出“促炎症因子”过度表达与SARS急性肺损伤及全身多器官的损害密切相关，也就是现在所说的“细胞因子风暴”。
Ding explained that, in 2003, he first proposed in the British Journal of Pathology that "lung and immune organs are the main target organs for SARS attack." In 2006, he published "a study on the immunopathological mechanism of SARS," suggesting that "excessive expression of inflammatory factors" is closely related to acute lung injury and multiple organ damage in SARS, now known as "cytokine storms."
当组织细胞受损后，身体产生过度的免疫反应，分泌大量的细胞因子，导致机体组织细胞变性、坏死，血管通透性增强，血液和血浆外渗等。
When tissue cells are damaged, the body produces excessive immune responses that secrete large amounts of cytokines, leading to degeneration, necrosis, enhanced vascular permeability, and blood and plasma leakage.
细胞因子风暴还会引发一氧化氮的大量释放，进一步稀释血液并破坏血管，血压降低，导致组织缺氧、低血压、多器官功能障碍和弥散性血管内凝血。
Cytokine storms can also trigger massive release of nitric oxide, further diluting blood and destroying blood vessels, lowering blood pressure and leading to tissue hypoxia, hypotension, multiorgan dysfunction and diffuse intravascular coagulation.
“这些需要一定数量尸体解剖的病理研究，综合分析。
"These require a certain number of autopsy pathologic studies, comprehensive analysis.
” 丁彦青说，与SARS起病凶猛不同，这次新冠病毒肺炎潜伏期长，早期病症轻，需要选择不同病情的病例，例如治疗一段时间后突然病情加重而死亡的案例，可能会更全面地反映疫情整体情况。
Unlike SARS, which has a long incubation period and a mild early stage of illness, Ding says cases requiring different conditions, such as sudden and severe death after a period of treatment, may provide a more comprehensive picture of the epidemic as a whole.
据丁彦青介绍，中国科学院院士卞修武已在中部战区医院搭建了符合生物安全保护Ⅲ级标准的“帐篷式”尸体解剖室，为更好的开展新型冠肺炎尸体解剖作准备。
Bian Xiuwu, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has set up a "tent-style" autopsy room in the Central War Hospital to meet the biosafety protection-III standard, according to Ding.
“我国缺少针对甲类传染病的解剖室，这个问题现在已经很紧迫了，新冠病毒之后还将面临什么，我们不知道，但要做好准备，”丁彦青呼吁，“至少一个省要有一间生物安全保护Ⅲ级(BSL -3)尸体解剖实验室。
"The lack of anatomy rooms for A-type infectious diseases in our country is a pressing issue now, we don't know what the future of the new crown virus will be, but be prepared," Ding called. "At least one province needs a BSL-3 autopsy laboratory.
