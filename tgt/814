从患者眼里读懂渴望和期盼唐都医院医护人员陈颖在抵达武汉第四天时，在朋友圈发布一条动态说，这是她第二次来武汉，2014年8月倾盆大雨，她和同学冒雨排着长队在公交站旁的一个小铺子买热干面，在武大的校园里穿行撒欢，像两只欢乐的小鸭子在水里扑腾。

陈颖的朋友圈 本文图片均为唐都医院提供陈颖说，这一次，她在武汉发现，这里没有了当年热气腾腾的热干面，没有了人流穿梭热闹非凡的户部巷，每天吃着差不多一样的盒饭，看着新闻里骤增的（疫情）数据，她犹豫过，彷徨过。
This time, she found out in Wuhan that there were no hot and dry noodles, no people scurrying through crowded streets, eating nearly the same boxes of rice every day, and watching the news soar, Chen Ying said.
但当她上班遇到那些病魔缠身的患者时，看到他们连说话的力气都没有，静静地无奈地半卧在病床上，费劲地呼吸着，病房里静悄悄的，她从他们的眼神里读懂了渴望和期盼。
But when she met the sick patients at work and saw that they did not have the strength to speak, quietly and helplessly half-lying on the bed, struggling to breathe, the ward quiet, she read the longing and expectation in their eyes.
陈颖在朋友圈中写道，这一双双眼睛坚定了她来时的初心，尽管护目镜已布满雾水模糊不清，即使汗水浸透衣背，她会拼尽全力，只为一个个鲜活的生命再次重归亲人身边。
Chen Ying wrote in her circle of friends that these eyes strengthened her first heart when she arrived, even though the goggles were foggy and blurred. Even if the sweat soaked her back, she would try her best to return to her loved ones for each fresh life.
