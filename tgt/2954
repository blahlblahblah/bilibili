随建筑坍塌的欣佳酒店原貌，疫情发生后，该酒店成为隔离点“两三秒钟整栋楼就塌了”李丽的家在四季康城一期，紧挨着欣佳宾馆，7日晚7点10分左右，李丽本打算照常把车子停在宾馆门前的一片空地上，突然听到玻璃碎落在地上的“噼啪”声。
After the outbreak of the outbreak, Li Li's home was in Four Seasons Kang City, next to the Xinjia Hotel. At about 7: 10 pm on the 7: 10 pm, Li Li was going to park her car on a vacant lot in front of the hotel when she heard the crackle of glass falling on the ground.
