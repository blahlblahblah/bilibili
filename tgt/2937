深度和角度——这就是我们能做的。
Depth and angle - that's what we can do.

有人说我们这样的医护是志愿者，不是“国家队”。
Some people say our medical staff are volunteers, not "national teams."
但这个我们不在乎。
But we don't care about that.
我在这里的同事，一个原来是自己开诊所、把诊所停业跑来支援的医生说：“我既然来了就是把生死置之度外了。
One of my colleagues here, a doctor who had run his own clinic and shut it down for support, said: "I've come here without caring for life or death.
”我没有去想他说的那么大的问题，我只想能尽到自己的职责，为救治病人帮忙。
I didn't think about the big question he was asking me, but I just wanted to do my part to help the sick.
我想，这忙应该是帮上了吧。
I think this is a good time to help.
口述：李瑞瑞整理：王  煜2月19日，高铁列车从南京南站开出，我的愿望终于要实现了：这趟车将把我带往武汉！在车上我才发消息告诉家人这件事儿，他们很着急：“这时候你怎么要去武汉啊？！”我回答：“我要去帮助救治病人！”李瑞瑞在支援武汉的岗位上其实，在春节前疫情刚暴发时，我就特别想能去武汉帮忙。
Li Ruirui: February 19, Wang Yu, the high-speed train from Nanjing South Station, my desire to finally come true: this train will take me to Wuhan! I only sent news to their families at this time, they worried: "How do you want to help Wuhan?" I replied: "I have to help Wuhan!
我是一名护士，但是在民营医院工作，通过单位安排去支援武汉的机会比较小。
I am a nurse, but work in private hospitals, through the unit arrangement to support Wuhan opportunities are relatively small.
也曾想过先去了武汉再说，可那段时间一直买不到过去的车票，我就先当起了线上志愿者。
Have also thought of going to Wuhan first, but that time has not been able to buy past tickets, I first served as online volunteers.
在线上志愿者的组织里，小伙伴们搜集微博、微信等各种渠道的求助信息，比如武汉等地有患者就医困难、有老人小孩没人照顾等等，联系当事人核实后，再帮助他们联系医院、政府、媒体等机构，尽力帮他们解决问题。
On-line volunteer organizations, small partners collect micro-blog, micro-letter and other sources of help information, such as Wuhan, where patients have difficulties in medical treatment, elderly children no one to take care of, contact the parties after verification, then help them contact hospitals, government, media and other agencies, do their best to help them solve their problems.
常常为了落实帮助方案、联系各个单位，我也要忙到凌晨两三点甚至要通宵工作。
Often I have to work until two or three in the morning, or even all night, in order to implement help programs and contact units.
可我还是一直想去武汉，因为我毕竟是个护士，希望能把我的专业技能贡献到一线。
But I still want to go to Wuhan, because I am a nurse after all, hope to be able to contribute my professional skills to the front line.
我从新闻上看到那边是很缺医护人员的，我想去了一定能帮上忙。
I saw on the news that there was a shortage of paramedics there, and I thought it would help.
至于感染的风险，这个我真没怎么考虑过。
As for the risk of infection, I don't really think about it.
可能因为我是个要强的人吧，想做的事儿就一定要想办法做到。
Maybe because I am a strong person, want to do things must be done.
终于，我在一个群里看到消息，说武昌区委组织部委托一家健康管理公司，在招募具有资质的医护人员支援当地医院抗击新冠肺炎。
Finally, I saw news in a group that the organizing department of the Wuchang District Committee had commissioned a health management company to recruit qualified medical staff to support the local hospital in the fight against SARS.
我赶紧报了名，后来入选了，我特别高兴。
I hastened to sign up, and later made it. I was very happy.
我们支援的是武汉市第七医院，这是当地的一家收治发热病人的定点医院，其中一个病区由我们这群来自天南海北的医护志愿者队伍接管。
We are supporting Wuhan Seventh Hospital, a local referral hospital for febrile patients, one of which is being taken over by our team of medical volunteers from all over the world.
我们这个团队有十几个人，有和我一样是民营医院的医护人员，也有自己开诊所的医生。
Our team of more than a dozen people, like me is a private hospital medical personnel, but also have their own clinic doctors.
我和他们之前都不认识，但一到医院都马上投入工作成为同事。
I didn't know either of them before, but as soon as I got to the hospital, I started working as a colleague.
李瑞瑞和同事们在武汉市第七医院的合影我们这个病区收治的是轻症的发热病人，其中有新冠肺炎的确诊患者。
Li Ruirui and his colleagues at Wuhan seventh hospital in the group photo of our sick area is treated with mild febrile patients, among them the confirmed patients with new crown pneumonia.
我做的是些繁杂琐事，比如给病人配药、发药、发饭，给病区消毒，给病人量体温、血压、血糖、血氧，给他们抽血、取咽拭子；然后尽量解答病人的疑问，满足他们的需求。
I do chores like dispensing medicine, dispensing medicine, delivering food, disinfecting the area, taking temperature, blood pressure, blood sugar, blood oxygen, taking blood and swabs, and then trying to answer their questions and meet their needs.
比如有病人会说：“我想做个核酸检测，能不能帮我申请一下？”有人会问：“护士，上次我的检查结果怎么还没出来呀？”有的就是问我再要个口罩。
For example, a patient might say, "I want to get a nucleic acid test, can you help me apply for it?" Someone would ask, "Nurse, why haven't the results of my last examination come out yet?"
有几天，好几个病人对医院安排的伙食吃不惯，想吃方便面。
On a few days, several patients could not get used to the food arranged by the hospital and wanted instant noodles.
我就去跟后勤的同事说，最后弄来了泡面。
I went over to my colleague at the logistics department and finally got the noodles.
有几个病人早餐想吃馒头包子，我也去想办法解决。
There are some patients who want steamed bread for breakfast, and I will try to solve it.
这每件事都不算难，但我们一个班一般只安排一名医生和一名护士，我要同时应对的是三十几名病人，只要病人有事儿轮流喊我，加上我自己要完成的任务，八九个小时里几乎没有空闲。
Everything was not difficult, but we usually had only one doctor and one nurse in a class, and I had to deal with about thirty patients at a time, and there was almost no free time for eight or nine hours as long as the patient took turns shouting at me and had to do my own work.
只有每次给病人发好饭，他们统一在吃饭的时候，我可能有十分钟能完整地歇一会儿。
Only every time I served a meal to a sick person, they would agree that I might have ten minutes to have a complete rest during the meal.
李瑞瑞（右）和同事的合照来之前我知道在武汉的病房要穿上全套的防护装备，也知道穿着那些会不舒服，但没有过多去想；我之前的护理岗位也没穿过这些。
Before the photo of Li Ruili (right) and her colleagues, I knew I had to wear full protective gear in the Wuhan ward, and I knew it would be uncomfortable to wear, but I didn't think too much about it; neither did my previous nursing job.
我觉得所有困难都会被我打败，但现实比我想象的还是要难许多。
I think all the difficulties will be defeated by me, but the reality is much more difficult than I thought.
在防护服里很快就会全身汗透，然后蒸发干，接着再汗透、再干，八九个小时，整个身体时不时要泡在汗里。
In protective clothing you will soon sweat thoroughly, then evaporate, then perspire, dry again, for eight or nine hours, and the whole body will occasionally soak in sweat.
下班回到酒店，我第一件事就是一口气喝完一瓶矿泉水，然后冲进淋浴间洗澡，我觉得自己实在是又脏又臭，沐浴露、洗发水、护发素至少要用上三遍心里才觉得舒服点。
The first thing I did when I got back from work was to drink a bottle of mineral water and run into the shower. I thought I was really dirty and smelly.
平时生活中的李瑞瑞长时间戴着口罩和护目镜，脱掉之后，我脸上像是被爪子抓过一样，横七竖八全是压痕。
LiRuiRui in ordinary life long wearing masks and goggles, after taking off, my face as if claws have been scratched, streaked with indentation.
我平时算是个挺爱漂亮的人，现在每次下班后都不敢看镜子里自己的脸。
I'm usually quite a pretty person and now I don't dare to look at my face in the mirror after work.
不光看上去吓人，被压的地方还特别疼。
Not only did it look scary, but the area where it was pressed hurt.
压痕只有靠自己揉一揉，睡觉前敷点面膜来缓解。
The indentation only depends on oneself kneads a knead, bedtime apply a little facial mask to alleviate.
在这边已经十多天了，我们护士自己带来的面膜都快用完了，住我隔壁的女同事跑来问我借牙膏，说要涂在脸上看能不能缓解下疼痛。
For more than a decade now, we nurses had run out of masks of our own. The woman next door came to me and asked me to borrow the toothpaste and apply it to my face to see if it would relieve the pain.
我在自己本职的医院工作时，很不愿意上夜班；但到了这里，夜班是肯定要上的。
When I was working in my own hospital, I was very reluctant to work at night; but here night work was certain.
“大夜班”是从晚上12点开始到第二天早上8点，不过到了早上5点左右，我就要给需要做检测的病人抽血和取咽拭子了，常常取着样，就到了天亮。
The night shift starts at 12 p.m. and ends at 8 a.m., but around 5 am I take blood and swabs from patients who need to be tested.
值夜班时，稍有一小会儿空闲，李瑞瑞打个盹儿穿着隔离服上班的整段时间不能吃喝，开始工作的前几天我到了饭点时真是饿得特别难受，但后来慢慢习惯了。
On the night shift, after a short break, Li Ruirui dozed off and couldn't eat or drink for the entire time he went to work. I was starving terribly the other day, but got used to it.
其实，不光是工作时候不能吃喝，为了避免那段时间上厕所，我在每天自己轮班开始时间点前的5个小时就开始不吃东西了，这样有时一天就只能吃上一顿饭。
Not only can't I eat and drink at work, but to avoid going to the bathroom during that time, I start skipping meals five hours before the start of my shift each day, sometimes just one meal a day.
其实，再难都是我自己愿意来的，没有任何人要求我、号召我。
In fact, no matter how difficult it is that I would like to come, no one asked me to call on me.
而且我能做这些，真的很开心。
And I'm really happy that I can do this.
我觉得其他的志愿者是真的很辛苦，比如开车接送我们上下班的志愿者司机师傅，有时我下班时快凌晨一点了，他还是等着我，把我送到住处。
I think the other volunteers are really hard-working, like the volunteer drivers who drive us to and from work, and sometimes I come in the early hours of the morning and he still waits for me to take me to my place of residence.
前几天，我在给病区消毒时，一位病人跟我说：“瑞瑞，你怎么那么勤快啊。
The other day, when I was disinfecting the area, a patient said to me, "Larry, why are you so diligent?
”我说：“想让你们能早点出院啊。
I said, "I want you to get out of the hospital early.
”这两天也陆续会有人出院了，看到他们笑着跟我道别，那是我最高兴的时候，觉得自己即使24小时上班都没问题，都是值得的。
People are coming out of the hospital in the next two days, and it's been a great time for me to see them say good-bye with a smile, and it's worth it to feel like I can work even 24 hours a day.
李瑞瑞为病人比心加油有人说我们这样的医护是志愿者，不是“国家队”。
Li Ruili for the patients than heart refueling some people say that our medical care is volunteers, not "national team."
但这个我们不在乎。
But we don't care about that.
我在这里的同事，一个原来是自己开诊所、把诊所停业跑来支援的医生说：“我既然来了就是把生死置之度外了。

我想，这忙应该是帮上了吧。
I think this is a good time to help.
