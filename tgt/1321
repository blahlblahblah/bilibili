写日记不仅能够记录工作，还成为她自我解压的好办法。
Keeping a diary is not only a way of keeping track of her work, but also a great way of relieving herself.
文 | 黄　祺　袁蕙芸年初一晚上，上海交大医学院附属仁济医院查琼芳医生，在武汉的宾馆房间里写下了第一篇“战地日记”。
Huang Yun-yun, an associate of Shanghai Jiaotong Medical College, wrote the first "war diary" in her hotel room at Wuhan on Monday evening.
从小年夜（1月23日）接到出发通知，到除夕夜出发，再到抵达武汉接受岗前培训——查医生经历了特殊的两个日夜，情绪起起伏伏。
From his departure notice on January 23 to his departure on New Year's Eve and his arrival in Wuhan for pre-job trainDr Cha went through two special days and nights and experienced ups and downs.
培训会上，领队特意嘱咐，大家要恢复平静的心态，冷静应对接下来的苦战。
At the training meeting, the leader of the team specifically instructed that we should restore calm mentality, calm to deal with the next hard fight.
培训结束后回到房间，查医生决定从记录工作开始冷静自己。
Returning to his room after the training, Dr. Chase decided to start taking notes and cool off.
她说，第一篇日记其实是工作汇报，主要是给远在上海的单位领导汇报到达武汉后的情况，给同事们报个平安，同时也梳理一下心绪。
She said that the first diary is actually the work of the report, mainly to the unit leaders in Shanghai after the arrival of Wuhan, to give colleagues a safe, but also combing the mood.
但没想到，从那一天起，日记一天也没有落下，至今已经写了22篇。
Unexpectedly, from that day on, the diary did not fall a day, to date has written 22.
后来查琼芳发现，写日记不仅能够记录工作，还成为她自我解压的好办法。
Later, Cha Qiongfang discovered that keeping a diary can not only record work, but also become a good way for her to self-depress.
查琼芳医生工作的武汉金银潭医院，是武汉市最早集中收治新冠肺炎病人的医院，上海医疗队接管的重症病房里，患者病情也是最重的。
The Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital, where Dr. Cha Qiongfang worked, was the first hospital in Wuhan to concentrate on treating patients with Xinguan Pneumonia.
医护人员们的工作强度和工作压力，可想而知。
It is conceivable that the work intensity and work pressure of the medical staff.
虽然平时仁济医院的工作也非常辛苦，但这是第一次在强传染性的疫情中工作，而且是在高风险的重症监护室里工作，对查琼芳来说，是一种完全不同的压力。
Although Yan Chai Hospital is also very hard work, but this is the first time to work in a highly infectious epidemic, but also in a high-risk intensive care unit, for Cha Qiongfang, is a completely different kind of pressure.
武汉金银潭医院，最初因为没有取暖设备，第一个夜班后护士冻红的手引起了社会关注。
Wuhan gold and silver pool hospital, because there was no heating equipment, the first night after the nurses frozen red hands aroused social concern.
查医生说，如今社会各界捐赠了很多物资，病房里有了“小太阳”，贴了暖宝宝，还有人捐大衣，晚上上班已经不冷了，“和刚来时比简直是天上地下”。
Today, doctors said, the community donated a lot of goods, the ward has a "small sun," a warm baby, and someone donated coat, at night it is not cold to work, "and the first time it is simply heaven and earth.
如果不是疫情，查医生准备把母亲接到自己家，平时工作忙，看望不多，过年过节把母亲接到身边，是她最大的愿望。
If it was not for the outbreak of the disease, the doctor is ready to take her mother to her own home, usually busy work, not many visits, the New Year holiday to her mother, is her greatest wish.
查医生家的两个冰箱，也被她塞满了年货——每年的年夜饭，她是大家庭的主厨，亲人们给她打下手，十来人的一桌饭不成问题。
She packed the doctor's two refrigerators with New Year's Eve dinners; she was the head chef of the extended family, helped by relatives; a table for about a dozen people was no problem.
查医生说，春节还有个愿望，是睡到自然醒——作为仁济医院呼吸科一个病区的病区大组长、一个独当一面的高年资医生来说，睡到自然醒是一年中难得的奢侈享受，“做梦都想做的事情”。
Dr Cha said the Chinese New Year also has a wish to sleep until it wakes up naturally - as the head of a respiratory ward at Yan Chai Hospital, a self-sufficient, high-seniority doctor.
小年夜接到领导电话，查琼芳医生一点没有犹豫就报名参加了医疗队，“这样的时刻，不挺身而出对不起医生的称号，也对不起党员的称号”。
When Dr. Cha Qiongfang signed up for the medical team without any hesitation, he said, "At a time like this, I don't stand up for the doctor and I'm sorry for the party name."
说起疫情结束后想干点什么，查医生的第一个愿望是不戴口罩——因为口罩戴太久了；第二个愿望是去热闹的商场逛逛，“以前我总是嫌弃马路上人多，现在发现马路上没有一个人，只能窝在家里，也是一件很痛苦的事情。
When it comes to what to do when the epidemic is over, the doctor's first wish is not to wear a mask because it has lasted too long. The second is to go to a busy shopping mall.
失去了才会觉得珍惜”。
If you lose it, you will appreciate it.
RECOMMEND查医生的“战地日记”在这个特殊的情人节，请相信爱的力量文 |查琼芳2月14日，援鄂第二十一天，武汉，雨。
RECOMMEND CHINA'S "War Diary" On this special Valentine's Day, please believe in the power of love!!!!!!
6:30起床，本该蒙蒙亮的天，依旧漆黑一片，时有闪电划过天边，倾盆大雨从天而降。
6: 30 Wake up, should be covered in the sky, is still dark, sometimes Lightning across the sky, pouring rain from the sky.
到达武汉三周了，似乎这么大的雨还是第一次见到。
Three weeks after arriving in Wuhan, it seems that it is the first time such a heavy rain has been seen.
吃完早饭，刚走出酒店大门，大雨便渐渐停了。
After breakfast, just left the hotel door, the heavy rain gradually stopped.
春天的雷阵雨，来得快去得也快。
Thunderstorms in spring come and go fast.
路边树上的花骨朵并没有被暴雨击垮，反而在雨后渐渐绽放，他们从嫩绿的枝叶间探出头来，让人感受到生命的力量。
Roadside trees are not destroyed by the rainstorm, but gradually blooming after the rain, they peeped out from among the green branches, people feel the power of life.
路边的马路积水了，需要绕行。
The roadside road is full of water and needs a detour.
雨后的天气，感觉特别潮闷，戴着口罩走到金银潭医院，虽然只有短短十几分钟已是一身大汗。
After the rain, feel particularly damp, wearing a mask to the gold and silver pool hospital, although only a few minutes has been a big sweat.
今天是查房班，不用进隔离病房，只需在医生办公室处理文书。
Today is the room inspection class, do not enter the isolation ward, just in the doctor's office to deal with the paperwork.
办公室气氛有点压抑，原来插管的病人还是离世了，陈教授的病毒炎症风暴理论被再次验证。
The atmosphere in the office was a bit depressing. The patient who had been intubated died, and Professor Chen's theory of viral inflammation was tested again.
三位ICU的值班医生昨晚忙碌了一夜依然回天乏术。
The three doctors on duty at the ICU were up for grabs last night.
能想的都想了，该做的也都做了：气管插管、有创通气、俯卧位通气、肺复张......可是，病毒仍旧那么嚣张地把病人带走了。
Can think of everything, to do: trachea intubation, invasive ventilation, prone position ventilation, lung re-opened... but the virus still so arrogant took the patient away.
交班结束后大家就目前观察到的死亡病例进行了分析和总结：没有分泌物的气道、无法复张的肺泡、凝血功能的障碍、心肌酶谱的升高、难以控制的血压、补液量的控制......。
At the end of the shift, currently observed deaths were analysed and summarized: airways with no secretions, unreleasable alveoli, impaired coagulation function, elevated myocardial enzyme profile, uncontrolled blood pressure, fluid rehydration...
因为来自上海各大医院，大家背后都有各自的团队出谋划策，郑队询问了大家对于治疗是否有新的想法。
Because from the major hospitals in Shanghai, everyone has their own team behind the advice, Zheng asked everyone if there are new ideas for treatment.
大家各抒己见后郑队总结治疗方向：第一条路求稳，严格按照指南操作，可是这条路目前似乎很难降低危重症患者的死亡率；第二条路稳中求进，我们可以在指南用药的基础上，增加一些可能有用的药物；第三条路冒点风险，如果有些药物能够救人，可以用，但是前提是需要通过医学伦理审查。
After each group expressed their views, Zheng summed up the direction of treatment: the first way to stability, strict operation according to the guidelines, but the road seems to be very difficult to reduce the death rate of critically ill patients; the second approach based on the guidelines, we can add some potentially useful drugs; the third risk, if some drugs can save people, but only through medical ethics review.
今天也有好消息。
Good news today, too.
我们重症病房的第一例患者今天出院了。
The first patient in our intensive care unit was discharged today.
之前我们的病人好转后都是转到轻病房，统计时不算在我们病区出院。
Previously our patients were transferred to the light ward after the improvement, the statistics do not count in our hospital discharge area.
驰援武汉20多天来，我们第一次感受到患者出院的喜悦：当看到病人举起大拇指，欣喜若狂的我们感觉所有的付出都是值得的。
For the first time in more than 20 days, we felt the exhilaration of being discharged from the hospital. We were overjoyed to see our patients lift their thumbs.
我们重症病房有一对夫妻，15床和6床，同时感染了新冠肺炎，住进了隔离病房。
We had a couple in the intensive care unit, 15 beds and 6 beds, and we were admitted to the isolation ward with pneumonia.
15床的妻子比较重，需要无创通气；6床丈夫则相对轻，吸氧就可以了。
A 15-bed wife is heavier and needs no invasive ventilation, while a 6-bed husband is relatively light and needs oxygen.
胆小的15床时刻都需要人作陪，夜间是护士作陪，连上厕所也是叫护士站在门外，白天则是6床患者多次过去相陪。
Cowardly 15-bed all the time need to be accompanied by a nurse at night, even to the toilet is to ask nurses to stand outside the door, during the day is a six-bed patient to accompany many times.
今天是情人节，两人坐在一起，虽然没有鲜花，但是一人手捧一个苹果，无比“虔诚”地请我们的护士拍了一张合影。
Today is Valentine's Day, two people sitting together, although there are no flowers, but a person holding an apple, matchless "pious" asked our nurses to take a picture.
我想，等他们出院了，他们会永远记得今天这个特殊的情人节。
I think when they get out of the hospital, they will always remember this special Valentine's Day.
回到酒店，我们的队长助理张明明老师在群里发文：“我们是一群善良而有担当的人，我们的默默付出并不喧嚣，但就是那么有温度。
Back at the hotel, our captain's assistant, Mr. Zhang Mingming, sent a message in the group: "We are a group of kind and responsible people, our silent pay is not noisy, but it is so warm.
疫情虽然暂时阻隔了我们的脚步，但心与心的距离不会改变。
Although the epidemic temporarily blocked our steps, but the heart and heart distance will not change.
在这个特殊的情人节，相信爱的力量。
On this special Valentine's Day, believe in the power of love.
”队里为每一位队员准备了情人节礼物，一份费列罗巧克力和一份润肤乳，感谢每一位默默的付出。
The team prepared Valentine's Day gifts for each team member, a piece of Ferrero chocolates and a moisturizer, thanking everyone for their quiet time.
晚餐我们被“投喂”了麦当劳的汉堡和菠萝派，感受到吃撑的同时，也感受到社会大众满满的爱，连酒店精心准备的三个奶油蛋糕也只有看看的份了。
We were "tossed" to McDonald's hamburgers and pineapple pies for dinner, and we felt the love of the community at the same time.
