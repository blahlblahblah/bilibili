在千里之外的武汉，此次疫情的发源地，已经有15名医护人员确诊感染。
Thousands of miles away in Wuhan, the birthplace of the outbreak, 15 health-care workers have confirmed the infection.
在北京，也有医务人员遭到波及。

1月20日下午，针对“新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情”有关防控情况，国家卫健委高级别专家组组长钟南山院士等集体答记者问，他面对媒体首次证实：有医务人员感染。
On the afternoon of January 20, in response to the prevention and control of pneumonia due to the new coronavirus infection, the head of the high-level group of experts of the National Health Commission, Professor Zhong Nan-shan, answered questions.
后来陆续曝光的信息证实，14名医务人员被同一名患者传染。
Subsequent reports confirmed that 14 medical personnel had been infected by the same patient.
1月21日下午，武汉市市长周先旺接受央视采访时，介绍了“1传14”事件的经过。
On the afternoon of January 21, Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang was interviewed by CCTV and introduced the "1-biography 14" incident.
这次交叉感染发生在华中科技大学附属协和医院脑神经外科。
The cross-infection occurred in neurosurgery at Concorde Hospital, an affiliate of HUST.
正因为在脑神经外科，忽视了病人入院前已有新型冠状病毒感染。
Precisely because of the neurosurgery in the brain, the patient has been neglected before admission to hospital has a new coronavirus infection.
做完手术后，病人出现发烧，这时1名医生、13名护士已经被感染。
After the operation, the patient developed a fever, by which time a doctor and 13 nurses had been infected.
国家卫健委高级别专家组成员、香港大学微生物学讲座教授袁国勇院士指出，这种群组被感染的情况，反而较少会在内科或传染病科出现，因为这些科室医生会更加警惕。
Professor Yuan Guoyong, Professor of Microbiology at the University of Hong Kong and a member of the High Level Panel of the National Fitness and Health Commission, pointed out that the incidence of infection among these groups was less frequent in internal medicine or infectious disease departments, where doctors were more vigilant.
据袁国勇了解，这名病人在脑外科接受治疗，但他可能与其他确诊患者密切接触过或者吃过野味，而未向医生陈述接触史。
Yuan knew the patient was being treated for brain surgery, but he may have been in close contact with other confirmed patients or had eaten game, without giving a doctor a history of exposure.
但入院时新型冠状病毒肺炎可能仍处于潜伏期，没有发烧或肺炎症状，导致医务人员未能提高警觉。
However, the new coronavirus pneumonia may still be in incubation period at the time of admission.
“这个教训很深刻，就是防控要做到疏而不漏，对每一个细节、每一个环节都要做到严格的防控。
"The lesson is that prevention and control should be non-exhaustive, with every detail and every link to be strictly controlled.

2002年12月22日，钟南山所在的广州医学院第一附属医院接收了一名来自广东河源的肺炎病人。
On December 22, 2002, Zhong Nan Shan's First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical School received a pneumonia patient from Hebei Province.
两天后，在河源救治过该病人的8位医护人员，全部被感染。
Two days later, in Heyuan treated the patient's eight medical personnel, all infected.
那是钟南山接触的第一例SARS病人。
It was the first case of SARS in Zhong Nan Shan.
此次发现的病毒与SARS同属于冠状病毒。
This discovery of the virus and SARS belong to the coronavirus.
世卫组织官网介绍，已知感染人的冠状病毒共有7种，其中4种致病性较低，还有2种就是SARS病毒（严重急性呼吸综合征）和MERS病毒（中东呼吸综合征），均曾引发疫情。
Of the seven coronaviruses known to infect humans, four are of low pathogenicity and two are SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), the WHO website said.
不论在SARS还是此次疫情中，医务人员感染都是非常重要的标志——肺炎出现了人传人的情况。
Both in SARS and in the current outbreak, the infection of medical staff is a very important sign - pneumonia has a human-to-human situation.
“医务人员，有很多做公共工作的（职业），一个人得病以后可能传染很多人。
Medical staff, there are a lot of people who do public work and a person who gets sick can infect a lot of people.
”国家卫健委高级别专家组成员曾光提醒，“所以每个行业都得行动起来，千万别带病工作、带病旅游，这是非常危险的。
Zeng Guang, a member of the National Fitness and Wellness Commission's High-Level Panel, warned: "So every industry needs to act.
”━━━━━危险的“气溶胶”医务人员一直是疫情感染高危人群。
The dangerous aerosol medical personnel have always been a high-risk group for infectious diseases.
世界卫生组织数据统计显示，全球超过20％的SARS感染者是医护人员。
Statistics from the World Health Organization show that more than 20 percent of people infected with SARS are health care workers.
MERS爆发时, 医护人员感染风险同样很高，2014年2月17日-4月26日，沙特吉达出现的128例病例中，39例为医护人员。
At the time of the MERS outbreak, health-care workers were at equally high risk of infection, with 39 of the 128 cases reported from 17 February to 26 April 2014 in Saudi Jeddah.
原解放军四医大教授、全军呼吸学专家组成员吴昌归解释，医务人员有多种渠道会被感染肺炎病毒，包括直接接触，如摸到病人的手和身体，可能将病毒带到身上，进而进入医务人员的眼睛结膜或口腔中。
Wu Changgui, a former professor of the PLA's four medical universities and a member of the PLA's respiratory expert group, explained that there are many ways in which medical staff can be infected with the pneumonia virus, including direct contact with the hands and bodies of patients, which can carry the virus to the body and into the conjunctiva or oral cavity of the medical staff.
病毒也会通过飞沫传播，这些飞沫就是大气里飞扬的细碎颗粒。
The virus can also spread in droplets, which are fine particles that fly in the atmosphere.
病毒依附在比其硕大几倍的飞沫上，被感染者呼吸到带有病毒的飞沫，病毒就进入身体。
The virus clings to droplets several times larger than its size, and the infected person breathes droplets with the virus and the virus enters the body.
“所以我们戴口罩能滤过飞沫，就起到了隔绝病毒的作用。
"So we use masks to filter out droplets, which acts as a barrier to viruses," he said.
”吴昌归提醒，卸口罩时不要摸口罩外部，以免接触到病毒。
Wu Changgui cautioned against touching the outside of the mask when removing the mask to avoid contact with the virus.

视频截图视频/新京报记者马骏 赵志远另一种我们不熟悉的传播介质，可能比飞沫更危险。
Video screenshot / Beijing News reporter Ma Jun Zhao Zhiyuan another media we are not familiar with, may be more dangerous than froth.
吴昌归解释，人类呼出的水分以气体形式弥漫在空气中，这些雾化的物质就叫“气溶胶”。
Wu Changgui explained that the human exhalation of water in the form of gases in the air, these atomized substances are called "aerosols."
其颗粒比飞沫还要小得多，可能直接进入医护人员的呼吸道，导致病毒传播。
Its particles are much smaller than droplets and can enter the airways of health care workers, causing the virus to spread.
东南大学钱华等人的研究显示，近十多年, 多次爆发的呼吸道传染病，反复说明，病人呼出的微生物气溶胶包含大量携带病原体的飞沫和飞沫核, 是呼吸道传染病传播的重要载体。
A study by Qianhua et al., Southeastern University, shows that repeated outbreaks of respiratory infectious diseases over the past decade or so have repeatedly shown that microbiological aerosols exhaled by patients contain large amounts of pathogen-carrying droplets and foaming nuclei and are important carriers of respiratory infectious diseases.
不过，北京市疾控中心北京全球健康中心办公室主任研究员杨鹏表示，此次疫情中，病毒能否通过气溶胶传播，需要进一步调查和研究。
However, Yang Peng, director of the Beijing Center for Global Health at the Beijing CDC, said further investigation and research were needed to see if the virus could spread through aerosols.
根据以往冠状病毒的特点，飞沫传播和接触传播是主要的传播形式。
According to the characteristics of coronavirus in the past, droplet transmission and contact transmission are the main forms of transmission.
不管传播途径如何，得到公认的是，一线医务人员是高风险群体，气管插管、气管切开等临床治疗手段，都属于高风险操作。
Regardless of the route of transmission, it is recognized that front-line medical personnel are a high-risk group and that clinical treatments such as endotracheal intubation and tracheotomy are high-risk operations.
北京地坛医院感染病急诊科主任王凌航认为，医务人员的抵抗力和常人无异，而冬春季除了新型肺炎，还叠加流感流行，这意味着较大的防控压力。
Wang Ling-hang, director of the emergency department of infectious diseases at Beijing Ditan Hospital, said the resistance of medical staff was the same as that of ordinary people.
吴昌归认为，对于传染性肺炎，医务人员的感染风险显然大大高于普通人。
Wu Changgui thinks, for infectious pneumonia, the risk of infection of medical personnel is obviously much higher than the general population.
“普通人接触到的是可能被传染肺炎病毒的环境，而医务人员直接面对肺炎病人，无论接触的是疑似病患还是确诊病患，感染风险都要高于普通人。
"The average person is exposed to an environment that is likely to be infected with pneumonia, and the risk of infection is higher for those who are directly exposed to pneumonia patients, whether they are suspected or diagnosed."
”━━━━━“确实存在薄弱环节”“看到医务人员感染的病例，我们也感到很痛心，医务人员确实是一个高风险的职业。
There is a weak link We are also saddened to see cases of infection by medical personnel, who are indeed a high-risk profession.
”国家卫健委医政医管局负责人焦雅辉说。
Jiao Yahui, head of the National Hospital Authority, said.
王广发也很好奇自己是什么时候感染的病毒。
Wang is also curious about when he became infected with the virus.
在武汉工作期间，明明在医院时已经全程戴了N95口罩，甚至防溅屏，几乎“全副武装”。
During his work in Wuhan, Mingming was wearing a N95 mask throughout the hospital and even splash screens, almost "heavily armed."
他回想到，回京前2天去发热门诊和临时隔离病房时，没有配备防护眼镜。
He recalls returning to Beijing 2 days before going to the fever clinic and temporary isolation ward, did not wear protective glasses.
病毒也许就是趁着这个时间进入他的眼结膜。
The virus may have entered his conjunctiva at this time.
1月22日举行的国新办发布会上，焦雅辉表示，出现医务人员感染案例，为人传人提供了证据。
At a press conference on January 22, Mr. Jiao said there had been cases of infection among medical staff, providing evidence for human-to-human transmission.
另一方面，也暴露出医疗机构在医院感染防控方面，确实还存在着一些薄弱环节。
On the other hand, it also reveals that there are some weak links in hospital infection prevention and control.
焦雅辉解释，这与对病毒的危害和传播的认识，一开始没有达到这么高的等级有关。
Jiao explained that this was related to the understanding of the hazards and spread of the virus, which initially did not reach such a high level.
“我们对疾病的发展规律是逐渐认识的，这个疾病有发展和变化的过程，在早期和现在有不同特点，所以防护和医院感染控制措施也要进行相应调整。
"We are becoming aware of the development of the disease, which is a process of development and change, with different characteristics at an early stage and in the present, so protective and hospital infection control measures will have to be adjusted accordingly.
”SARS时期也曾经历这一过程。
The SARS period has gone through the same process.
广东药学院公共卫生学院、中国疾控中心与广州市第八人民医院等单位联合开展的一项研究显示，第一次接触SARS患者时没有使用防护服、口罩、眼罩和手套的工作人员, 感染SARS的危险，明显高于使用防护用具的人员。
A joint study by the Guangdong Institute of Pharmacy, the China CDC and Guangzhou's Eighth People's Hospital showed that workers who did not use protective clothing, masks, blindfolds and gloves when they first came into contact with SARS patients were significantly more at risk of contracting SARS than those using protective gear.
当年的疫情中，医务人员感染病毒的有一个明显变化曲线——大部分被感染的医务人员在2003年2月份确诊，3月份以后迅速减少。
During the outbreak, there was a clear curve of change in the infection rates of medical staff - most of whom were diagnosed in February 2003 and have declined rapidly since March.
这是因为，疫情爆发后，医务人员加强了个人防护，政府部门也提出了综合预防控制措施。
This is due to the strengthening of personal protection by medical personnel following the outbreak and the introduction of comprehensive preventive control measures by government departments.
“个人防护意识的建立和防护措施的到位，是降低感染的一个重要方面。
"The establishment of personal protective awareness and the putting in place of protective measures are an important aspect of infection reduction.
”这项研究指出。
"The study points out.
━━━━━采取更严格的防控措施央视记者近日探访武汉金银潭医院的重症监护隔离病房发现，医护人员要穿上隔离服、鞋套，戴上手套、口罩，进入病房要戴上N95口罩。

焦雅辉介绍，目前国家卫健委已经采取了一系列措施。
Jiao Yahui introduced that at present the national health committee has taken a series of measures.
一方面，修订和完善医务人员个人防护标准和规范；另一方面，提出了更加严格的医院感染防控措施。
On the one hand, the standards and norms of personal protection for medical personnel are revised and perfected; on the other hand, stricter measures for preventing and controlling nosocomial infections are proposed.
完善这些技术方案之后，还要对全国的医务人员进行培训。
The improvement of these technical programmes will be followed by the training of medical personnel throughout the country.
吴昌归认为，从2003年防治SARS至今，17年过去，对医务人员的防护措施已经比较完备。
Wu Changgui believes that since 2003 to prevent and treat SARS, 17 years have passed, the protection measures for medical personnel have been relatively complete.
“实际上，防护措施不需要很复杂，但再好的防护水平，也不可能把医护人员与患者完全隔绝，感染的风险不可能降低到零。

有医生告诉新京报记者，N95口罩物资紧张，并不能覆盖全员，目前主要只供应急诊科、呼吸科等主要科室。
Doctors told the Beijing News that the N95 mask was too tight to cover the entire staff, and that only the emergency department, respiration department and other major departments are now available.
