24.02.2020 Words: 3621 words: 3621, reading time about 6 minutes guide: The city of Wuhan, not isolated city.
作者 | 第一财经周芳作为疫情始发地，一座千万人口级别大都市选择封城，这在新中国还是第一次。
For the first time in New China, a metropolis of ten million people chose to seal the city as the start of the epidemic.
但武汉封城为尽可能多地减少传染源向各地输出做出了贡献。
But Wuhan has contributed to reducing the source of infection to as many places as possible.
包括世界卫生组织总干事谭德塞在内的多位专家学者认为，“封城”将降低疫情蔓延几率，他们称这一举措“非常恰当且非常重要”。
Experts and scholars, including World Health Organization Director General Theresa Tupper, said the closure would reduce the spread of the epidemic, calling the move "very appropriate and important."
从全国防控疫情层面看，武汉封城是一次战略性决定，但战略终究要配以地方战术来执行，作为史无前例的举动，在执行当中难免出现比较多的纰漏，但这也显示一些部门和基层的防控意识仍有不足，对策不尽周全。
In terms of national control and control of the epidemic, Wuhan Sealing is a strategic decision, but the strategy must eventually be accompanied by local tactics, as an unprecedented move in the implementation of the relatively weak, but it also shows that some departments and grass-roots control awareness is still inadequate, inadequate response.
封城至今已经过月，长时间封城带来的一些社会问题也开始显露。
Months have passed since the city was closed, and some of the social problems of the long siege have begun to surface.
中央指导组副组长、中央政法委秘书长陈一新2月22日要求，对长时间封城面临的诸多问题，指挥部要保持清醒头脑，超前研究，拿出有效对策。
On February 22, Chen Xinxin, vice-chairman of the Central Steering Group and secretary-general of the CPPCC, demanded that the headquarters remain clear-headed, ahead of the curve and come up with effective measures to deal with the many problems facing the city for a long time.
八个小时之内发生了什么1月23日凌晨2时，武汉市疫情防控指挥部发出了第一号通知：当天上午10时，全市公交、地铁、轮渡、长途客运暂停营运，机场、火车站离汉通道暂时关闭。
What Happened Within Eight Hours At 2 a.m. on January 23, Wuhan Municipal Command of Disease Control and Prevention issued No.1 Notice: At 10 a.m. on the same day, the city's public transport, subway, ferry, long-distance passenger transport operation, the airport, railway stations from Han corridor temporarily closed.
从决策发布到正式执行，这中间有8个小时的时间差。
There is a time lag of eight hours between the issuance of a decision and its formal implementation.
这个时间，已然足够一些当地民众做出自己的“重大决定”。
That is enough time for some local people to make their own "big decisions."
据不完全统计，1月23日0时到10时，武汉至少发出列车251列，北到哈尔滨，南达深圳，东到上海，西达成都，至少数十万人通过火车四散全国。
According to incomplete statistics, Wuhan issued at least 251 trains between 0000 and 1000 hours on January 23, reaching Harbin in the north, Shenzhen in the south, Shanghai in the east and Dudu in the west, spreading at least hundreds of thousands of people across the country by train.
1月23日上午11时许，高德地图显示，武汉各大高速出口收费站均呈现严重的红色拥堵——这基本都是赶着离开武汉的自驾人群。
At about 11 a.m. on January 23, Gao De's map showed that Wuhan's major high-speed export toll booths were all gridlocked with red - mostly self-driving people driving away from Wuhan.
中午12时左右，第一财经记者曾在武汉“东大门”青龙收费站看到，现场出城闸机通道仍然畅通无阻，车辆可以正常通行，而进城车辆则要接受安检。
Around 12 noon, the first financial reporter in Wuhan "East Gate" Qinglong toll station, the scene out of the city gate is still unimpeded traffic, vehicles can be normal traffic, traffic in the city will be subject to security screening.
这距离封城的截止时间已经过去了两个小时。
Two hours have passed since the closure deadline.
在第一财经独家刊发现场视频《武汉东大门出城通道畅通无阻》几小时后，直到当天下午，武汉的公路出城通道才被完全堵死。
In the first financial exclusive issue of the live video "Wuhan East Gate Barrier Free Access" a few hours later, until that afternoon, Wuhan highway out of the city thoroughfare was completely blocked.
下午2时左右，湖北省高速公路管理部门发布消息：省内武汉龚家岭、小军山、汉南、北湖、花山、柏泉、青龙、西湖站入口封闭。
At about 2 p.m., the highway administration of Hubei Province announced that the entrance to Gong Jialing, Xiaojun Mountain, Hannan, North Lake, Huashan, Baquan, Qinglong and West Lake Station in Wuhan Province was closed.
京港澳高速武汉西、武汉北、蔡甸、永安收费站口封闭。
Beijing, Hong Kong and Macao high-speed Wuhan West, Wuhan North, Cai dian, Yongan toll station closed.
其他出武汉市的高速公路口也已开始封闭。
Other highways out of Wuhan have also begun to close.
航空通道则到1月24日中午才完全关闭。
The air access route was closed completely by noon on 24 January.
虽然航空公司在23日10时之后取消了大部分涉及武汉的航班，但依据“软着陆”原则以及涉及联程航班等原因，最后一班飞机在24日12时55分才离开武汉天河国际机场。
Although the airline cancelled most of the flights involving Wuhan after 1000 hours on the 23rd, the last flight left Wuhan Tianhe International Airport at 12.55 on the 24th on the basis of the "soft landing" principle and other reasons involving connecting flights.
城门已闭，那些留下来和出不去的人开始涌入超市和药店，紧急采购各种生活物资和防护用品。
The gates were closed, and those who stayed and could not get out began to pour into supermarkets and pharmacies and to procure supplies and supplies for emergency use.
在武商量贩、中百仓储、沃尔玛等超市里，人们开始抢菜。
In the supermarkets of Wu Xiang, Zhong100 Warehouse and Wal-Mart, people began to grab vegetables.
“现在不能管价格贵不贵，能抢到吃的不挨饿就不错了。
"Now can not care about the price is not expensive, can grab the food do not starve is good.
”一位刘女士说。
"said one woman.
“我在超市里排了一个多小时的队，只抢到了两根白萝卜。
"I queued up in the supermarket for more than an hour and got only two turnips.
”家住武昌南湖的李女士说。
"said Li, who lives in Wuchang Nanhu.
▲23日，武汉一山姆会员店，货品被抢购一空。
23, Wuhan, a Sam member shop, goods were sold out.
1月23日，第一财经记者在武汉市区的好药师大药房、惠济药店等药店探访。
January 23, the first financial reporter in Wuhan City good pharmacist pharmacies, Weiji pharmacies and other pharmacies visit.
药店工作人员说，当天客流量明显比往常多，顾客集中购买的有常规防护用品、预防感冒药物、抗病毒药物及红外体温计等，防护口罩和手套也销售一空。
Pharmacists said traffic was noticeably higher than usual, with shoppers buying regular protective gear, cold medicine, antiviral drugs and infrared thermometers and selling out face masks and gloves.
对此，湖北省政协常委、湖北省统计局副局长叶青此后表示，市民的恐慌，同之以心，但政府却可以有更多作为——一是保持信息畅通透明和有效沟通，二是医用物资调配效率需提高，市民的情绪安抚、患者筛查和针对性的治疗需要做得更细。
In response, Ye Qing, deputy director of the Hubei Provincial Bureau of Statistics and Standing Committee of the CPPCC in Hubei Province, said that while the public panicked, the government could do more to keep the information flowing, transparent and effective.
500万人去了哪里封住武汉，只是控制了原发传染源的继续输出。
Five million people went to where to seal Wuhan, only to control the original source of infection continued to export.
而那些已经离开武汉但可能部分已经感染病毒的人，到底去了哪里？如何发现和找到他们？这成了后来的重点。
Where exactly did those who had already left Wuhan and might have been partially infected with the virus, and how to find and find them, became the focus later.
九省通衢的武汉，一直都是全国水陆空交通枢纽，也是中部地区外来人口的重要流入地。
Wuhan, a thoroughfare of nine provinces, has always been a national land, water and air transportation hub and an important destination for migrants from the central region.
1月26日晚，在湖北省新冠肺炎疫情防控新闻发布会上，武汉市长周先旺表示，因为春节和疫情的影响，截至1月26日有500多万人离开了武汉，还有900万人留在城里。
On the night of January 26, more than five million people had left Wuhan and nine million remained in the city as of January 26 due to the Spring Festival and the outbreak, said Zhou Xianwang, a spokesman for Wuhan city, at a news conference to prevent and control the outbreak.
这500多万人到底去了哪里？一时间引发举国关注。
Where the more than five million people have gone has aroused national concern for a while.
根据百度迁徙图，武汉封城前一天，即1月22日，离开武汉的人最多，其中流向湖北省内城市的最多，占比达到71.46%。
According to a migration map of Baidu, Wuhan had the largest number of people leaving Wuhan on January 22, the day before the city was closed, with the largest flow to cities in Hubei province, accounting for 71.46 percent.
这当中流向孝感（14.56%）、黄冈（14.08%）和荆州（6.11%）的人最多。
Filial piety (14.56 per cent), Huanggang (14.08 per cent) and Jingzhou (6.11 per cent) accounted for the largest flows.
此后的疫情演变也证实了外界的担忧。
The subsequent evolution of the epidemic has also confirmed concerns.
截至2月21日24时，孝感新冠肺炎确诊病例3429，黄冈确诊病例2899，荆州确诊病例1566，这是武汉之外，湖北省内疫情最严重的三个地区。
As of 2400 hours February 21, 3429 confirmed cases of filial piety pneumonia, 2899 confirmed cases of Huanggang, and 1566 confirmed cases in Jingzhou, the three worst-affected areas in Hubei Province, in addition to Wuhan.
除湖北省内城市之外，从武汉前往河南信阳、重庆、湖南长沙、北京、上海、河南郑州的人在封城前离汉者中的比例也较高。
In addition to cities in Hubei Province, people from Wuhan to Xinyang in Henan, Chongqing, Changsha in Hunan, Beijing, Shanghai and Zhengzhou in Henan Province also had a higher proportion of those who left before the closure of the city.
第一财经·新一线城市研究所引用百度地图慧眼的迁徙大数据也显示，1月10日至22日春运期间（武汉封城前），每天从武汉出发的人群中有六至七成的人前往湖北省内的其他城市，其次是河南省、湖南省、安徽省、重庆市、江西省。
Big data on migration from Baidu's map show that between 60 and 70 percent of people leaving Wuhan every day go to other cities in Hubei province, followed by Henan Province, Hunan Province, Anhui Province, Chongqing City and Jiangxi Province during the Spring Festival from January 10 to 22.
第一财经记者发现，在武汉封城之前的20多天，最多可以有6万多人从武汉飞到北京，5万多人分别从武汉飞到上海（虹桥+浦东），广州和成都。
The first financial reporter found that during the 20 days before Wuhan was closed, a maximum of 60,000 people could fly from Wuhan to Beijing and 50,000 from Wuhan to Shanghai (Hongqiao + Pudong), Guangzhou and Chengdu.
这500万离开武汉的人群中，除计划内的春节返乡人员外，也有一些是在获知“封城令”后连夜出城的人。
Five million people left Wuhan, in addition to the planned Spring Festival returnees, but also after the "closure order" night after the people out of the city.
而从此后国内各省疫情通报中可以发现，从武汉过来的人员，占了确诊病例的多数，而且传染给了相当一部分当地市民。
From then on, we can find that most of the confirmed cases come from Wuhan, and also infect a considerable part of the local citizens.
1月21日，一位流行病学专家就曾对此做出预警。
On 21 January, an epidemiologist gave an early warning.
他对第一财经表示：“这个病毒的潜伏期中位数是9天，目前的检验设备只能起到对发烧患者的监测，对于病毒携带者没有办法识别，未来可能有更多省份因为人口流动而出现新发病例。
"The median incubation period for the virus is nine days, the current test equipment can only monitor people with fever, there is no way to identify carriers of the virus, and more provinces may have new cases in the future due to population movements," he told First Finance.
”床位，物资！封城的武汉开始围剿病毒，但此时疫情底数已经开始快速放大，无论医用物资还是诊疗能力，骤然显得短缺。
Wuhan, the capital, began to hunt down the virus, but by this time the epidemic's base had begun to expand rapidly, suddenly becoming short of medical supplies and diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities.
▲23日，武汉当地医院发热门诊为应对发热病人因无序就医可能带来的交叉感染和疾病传播，武汉起初实行发热病人集中就诊的“7+7”新模式。
23, Wuhan local hospital fever clinic in response to fever patients due to disorderly cross-infection and disease transmission, Wuhan initially implemented a fever patients concentrated clinic "7 + 7" model.
即在城区7家大型医院附近选择了7家二级公立医院作为发热门诊的定点医院，转移病人、腾空病房全部用于接收发热病人，当时计划腾出3400张床位，专门对发热患者进行门诊。
In other words, seven secondary public hospitals were selected near seven major hospitals in the urban areas to serve as referral hospitals for fever clinics, relocating patients and vacating wards to receive febrile patients, while 3,400 beds were planned to be made available for outpatient consultations with febrile patients.
然而，面对呈几何级数增加的新冠肺炎疑似和确诊患者，3400张床位根本不够用。
Yet, in the face of a geometric progression of suspected and diagnosed cases of pneumonia, 3,400 beds are simply not enough.
1月23日封城当天，第一财经记者曾致电上述14家定点门诊，除了一家医院尚有少量床位外，其他定点医院都已住满。
On January 23, the first financial reporter called the 14 designated clinics and all but one hospital were fully occupied.
和病魔抢时间，武汉医疗系统的救治能力却已经达到极限。
And the disease fighting time, Wuhan medical system has reached the limit of the ability to cure.
网传且后来得到证实的视频显示，一线的医护人员边抹眼泪边工作。
Video footage broadcast and later confirmed showed front-line health workers wiping tears as they worked.
恐慌的病患在医院里聚集，更是放大了恐慌情绪。
Panic-stricken patients congregate in hospitals, exacerbating panic.
微信朋友圈里，微博超话里，不断有人求助，请求帮助收治家中的疑似病人。
Weixin in the circle of friends, Weibo ultra-language, people continue to ask for help in the treatment of suspected patients at home.
由于医院没有病床接收，很多确诊的轻症患者也不得不选择居家隔离。
With no hospital beds available, many diagnosed light patients have had to choose to stay in isolation.
2月2日，钟南山在接受采访时曾表示，目前有疑似和已经确诊的患者因病房不够回家自行隔离，这种行为非常危险。
In an interview on Feb. 2, Zhong said there were dangerous cases of suspected and confirmed patients returning home from inadequate wards.
此外，一个新的情况出现了——无暴露史病例在增加，也就是说，部分患者起病症状轻微，无发热。
In addition, a new situation has emerged - no history of exposure is increasing, that is, some patients start mild symptoms, no fever.
1月23日，第一财经记者发现，武汉当地医院还在以体温37.3度作为是否接诊的标准。
On January 23, the first financial reporter found that Wuhan local hospital temperature 37.3 degrees as the standard for admission.
而已确诊病例中，不发烧但被确诊为新型冠状病毒肺炎的患者已经出现，37.3度已经不是判断疑似的标准。
Of the confirmed cases, those who did not have a fever but were diagnosed as new coronavirus pneumonia have appeared and 37.3 degrees is no longer the standard for judging suspicion.
这样，被推回家或推往其他医疗机构的患者，有可能失去了第一时间被发现、治疗的机会，病毒也可能因此继续扩散。
As a result, patients pushed home or pushed to other health facilities may lose their first chance of being detected and treated, and the virus may continue to spread as a result.
第一财经当日发声，呼吁改变武汉“37.3度”接诊标准，及早发现行走的传染源。
The first financial day voice, calling for changes in Wuhan "37.3 degrees" admission criteria, early detection of the source of infection walking.
这一改变对发现病毒携带者尤为重要，但同时也意味着，武汉仍需要更多的床位和医用物资。
The change is particularly important for detecting carriers, but it also means Wuhan still needs more beds and medical supplies.
既有医院床位不足，新建就是必需之举。
Existing hospital beds are inadequate and new construction is necessary.
越来越多的人士建议武汉借鉴非典时期北京的“小汤山医院”模式，紧急建一所专门的传染病医院，集中收治感染病患。
More and more people suggest that Wuhan draw lessons from the SARS Beijing "Xiaotangshan Hospital" model, urgently build a special infectious disease hospital, concentrate on treating infected patients.
1月23日，武汉市政府要求中建三局等四个建设单位在6天内，按北京小汤山模式建成火神山医院，地点位于蔡甸区知音湖畔武汉职工疗养院。
On January 23, Wuhan city government asked four construction units, including Zhongjian Construction Bureau, to build the Huoshen Mountain Hospital in the Xiaotangshan model of Beijing in a six-day period at the Wuhan Workers Sanatorium on the banks of Jieyin Lake in Cai Den.
医院为板房形式，层高一至两层，占地70亩，1000张病床。
The hospital is a slab room with one to two storeys high and covers an area of 70 mu and 1000 beds.
当晚，施工车辆就到了现场。
That evening, the construction vehicle arrived at the scene.
1月24日上午，第一财经记者在现场看到，挖掘机经过十多个小时不间断的作业，已进入填埋石料阶段。
January 24 morning, the first financial reporter saw at the scene, excavators after more than 10 hours of uninterrupted operation, has entered the landfill stone stage.
重型卡车将车厢内的石料卸下，推土机迅速将其填满在地面。
Heavy trucks unloaded the stones from the carriages and bulldozers quickly filled them to the ground.
现场施工人员介绍，有200余台重型设备在持续作业。
Site construction personnel introduced that there are more than 200 heavy equipment in continuous operation.
1月25日下午，武汉宣布再建一个小汤山医院——雷神山医院，建筑面积3万平方米，新增床位1300张。
On the afternoon of January 25, Wuhan announced the construction of another small Tangshan Hospital - Lei Shenshan Hospital, with a floor area of 30,000 square meters and an additional 1,300 beds.
除了床位难题，医用物资短缺也日益凸显。
In addition to the bedspace problem, the shortage of medical supplies is becoming more and more obvious.
1月23日，一位政府工作人员对第一财经表示：“我们很缺很缺防护物资，病床也严重不足。
On January 23, a government official told First Finance: "We are in short supply of protective equipment and there is a serious shortage of hospital beds.
”武汉市第三医院成为定点医院时，医生只有少量N95标准的医用防护口罩，几乎没有防护服和护目镜。
When Wuhan Third Hospital became a designated hospital, doctors had only a small number of N95 standard medical masks and few protective clothing and goggles.
武汉金银潭医院的医生当时说，进入病房前，全身要消毒，4小时一个班，当中无法喝水（防止感染），也无法上厕所（节省防护服），高强度的4小时下来，整个人在厚重的防护服内大汗淋漓。
Before entering the ward, doctors at Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital said the entire body had to be sterilized, four hours a day, during which they could not drink water (prevent infection) or go to the toilet (save on protective clothing).
4小时甚至10小时不喝水不进食地工作，后来成为一线医护人员——包括后续赶来支援的医疗队员的惯例，因为防护服太缺了。
Working without water for 4 hours or even 10 hours became the norm for first-line medical personnel, including those who arrived to support them, because protective clothing was too scarce.
封城后的几天内，武汉有8家医院相继发出公告，向社会各界募捐护目镜、N95级别医用防护口罩、一次性外科手术口罩、医用帽、防护服、手术衣、防冲击眼罩、防护面罩等物资。
Within days of the city's closure, eight hospitals in Wuhan issued notices to solicit donations from various sectors of society for goggles, N95-grade medical protection masks, disposable surgical masks, medical caps, protective clothing, surgical clothing, anti-impact eye masks, protective masks and other materials.
据有关部门测算，截至1月31日，湖北本省只能生产医用口罩800万个，防护服200万套，红外测温仪1200套，不能满足全省防疫需要。
As of Jan. 31, only 8 million medical masks, 2 million suits of protective clothing and 1,200 sets of infrared thermometers could be produced in Hubei province, according to estimates from relevant departments.
彼时的武汉，无论医用物资还是诊疗能力，亟待全国驰援。
Wuhan at that time, whether the medical supplies or diagnostic and therapeutic capacity, urgently needed national assistance.
此后，浩浩荡荡的医疗大军开始增援武汉，截至2月17日，全国各地已经派出3.2万余名医务人员来支持湖北武汉，无数的物质和医疗器械向武汉发送。
As of February 17, more than 32,000 medical personnel from all over China had been sent to Wuhan, Hubei Province, and countless supplies and medical equipment had been sent to Wuhan.
封城武汉，不是孤城。
Wuhan is not a lonely city.
