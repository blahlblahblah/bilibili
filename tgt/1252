我从没有担心自己会感染，干社区工作10多年了，我们总是在第一线。

疫情面前，争分夺秒，全国近400万名社区工作者站在了前线。
In the face of the epidemic, nearly 4 million community workers across the country are on the front line.
。
.
基层社区承担着排查“第一道防线”，亦有系统布局上的深刻意义。
Grass-roots communities bear the responsibility of checking the "first line of defense," but also the system layout of profound significance.
2020年1月27日，国家卫健委指出，社区是实施网格化管理的基础，是传染病防控的第一道防线，以社区防控为重点，切实落实综合防控措施，做到“早发现、早报告、早隔离、早诊断、早治疗”，将有效地遏制疫情扩散和蔓延。
On 27 January 2020, the National Health Committee stated that the community was the basis for the implementation of grid management and the first line of defence against infectious diseases. The focus was on community prevention and control, and the effective implementation of comprehensive prevention and control measures to achieve "early detection, early reporting, early separation, early diagnosis and treatment" would effectively curb the spread and spread of the epidemic.
2月7日，民政部发布《致全国城乡社区工作者的一封信》，希望全国城乡社区工作者进一步强化社区防控网格化管理，实施地毯式排查，并协助解决实际困难。
On 7 February, the Ministry of Civil Affairs issued a letter to urban and rural community workers nationwide, in which it was hoped that community workers across the country would further strengthen community control over grid management, implement carpet screening and assist in resolving practical difficulties.

50岁的吴红是湖北省随州市一名社区工作人员，疫情发生至今，她已经连续工作了20余天。
Wu Hong, 50, a community worker in Suizhou, Hubei province, has worked for more than 20 consecutive days since the outbreak began.
她所在的社区仅有6名工作人员，而社区居民逾5000余人。
Her community has only six workers and more than 5,000 residents.
她如何守好“第一道阀门”？。
How does she keep her "first valve"?
以下是吴红口述：。
Here is Wu Hong's dictation.
2020年1月24日开始，我们社区就进入了紧张的工作状态。
Starting on 24 January 2020, our community is in a state of intense work.
。
.
我们社区参与疫情防控工作的人员共有6个人，但社区居民有5000多人。
There are six people in our community involved in the prevention and control of the epidemic, but there are more than 5,000 people in the community.
疫情刚开始的时候，我们主要是在社区进行宣传。
At the beginning of the epidemic, we were mainly raising awareness in the community.
形势越来越严重之后，措施也逐步升级：给居民测体温、建立健康档案；在各个小区、路口严格禁止出行，加强宣传；另外还要为居民配送物资。
As the situation has worsened, measures have been stepped up: the population has been given temperature tests, health records have been established, travel has been strictly prohibited in various neighbourhoods and junctions and publicity has been stepped up, and supplies have been distributed to the population.
。
.
刚开始老百姓不理解为什么要封闭小区，会担心影响他们的生活。
At first people do not understand why to close the community, will worry about affecting their lives.
通过我们讲解之后，他们也慢慢理解配合我们的工作。
Through our presentations, they also came to understand and cooperate with our work.
。
.
我们没有“休息”这一说法，从早上八点半开始工作，有时会到晚上十点半之后才结束。
We don't say "rest." We start at 8: 30 in the morning and sometimes don't finish until after 10: 30 in the evening.
我今天上午刚到单位，小区的值守人员就来找我们要消毒酒精，提交报表。
I just arrived at work this morning, the guard came to us to disinfect alcohol, to submit statements.
其他同事遇到解决不了的事或者拿不准的问题会来找我，我也要跟他们解释。
Other colleagues will come to me if they have problems that they can't solve or are unsure of. I'll explain it to them, too.
。
.
不止是疫情。
It's not just the epidemic.
一天之中，我会接到很多居民的电话，有的反映家里没有米了，有的询问有病例的楼栋是否消毒，还有的问垃圾怎么处理……我们每天会遇到各种各样的问题。
In the course of the day, I get many calls from residents, some about the lack of rice at home, some about disinfection of buildings with cases, and some about what to do with the garbage... we encounter all kinds of problems every day.
居民闷在家里，不知道外面的情况，总是不放心，就会打电话问我们。
Residents in the home, do not know the outside of the situation, always uneasy, will call us to ask.
。
.
下午1点半，我才回家吃饭，还没吃完就接到了居民的电话，询问配送的物品什么时候到，我们马上联系志愿者帮忙配送。
At 1: 30 p.m., I went home for dinner. Before I could finish eating, I got a call from the residents asking when the goods would arrive.
一般来说，居民打来电话说需要什么东西，我们就会和志愿者联系去买，然后立即给居民送去。
Generally speaking, when residents call to say what they need, we contact the volunteers to buy it and send it to the residents immediately.
。
.
现在社区封闭后，去单位上班的居民开具证明可以放行。
Now that the community is closed, residents who go to work can be released with a certificate.
除了上班人员以外，其他的人一律不能出去。
No one can go out except the people at work.
但仍有一些人不听值守人员的劝阻，非要出去小区。
But there are still some people who do not listen to the guard's dissuasion, insisted to go out of the community.
特别是有些年纪大的居民不理解，跟值守人员争吵，甚至耍脾气。
In particular, some elderly residents do not understand, with the guard on the quarrel, or even temper.
。
.
今天我就遇到了一个年纪很大的老人，她有高血压，要出去买药，值守人员给我打电话说了这个情况，我过去做了她的工作，最后她同意不出去，由配送员送。
Today, I met a very old man who had high blood pressure and wanted to go out to buy some medicine. The watchman called me and told me about it.
我们只能这样耐心去做居民工作。
We have to be patient with the residents.
。
.
像这样买药的情况不多，但是每个小区里都存在不配合的情况，出去买药也会有风险，我们只能按要求“禁止放行”。
There are not many cases of buying drugs like this, but there is no cooperation in every small area, and there are risks in going out to buy drugs.
。
.
今天下午，上级领导来了解情况，我们汇报了目前为止的确诊和疑似病例的数量、社区宣传及摸排情况。
This afternoon, our superiors came to see the situation, and we reported on the number of confirmed and suspected cases, community awareness and mapping to date.
。
.
目前，小区确诊的有10例，第一例确诊患者已经死亡。
At present, 10 cases have been diagnosed in the community and the first confirmed case has died.
我们发现确诊患者之后就马上上报，然后进行隔离，把患者送到医院进行救治，也对患者的家人进行隔离。
Once we find the patient, we report it immediately, isolate it, take the patient to a hospital for treatment, and isolate the patient's family.
同时，我们马上和疾控部门联系，去给患者家和楼道进行消毒，再通知患者所在单元的居民尽量不出门。
At the same time, we immediately contacted the CDC to disinfect the patient's home and hallway, and to inform the patient's unit that he or she should not go out.
。
.
今天有个居民打电话和我说有点不舒服，发烧到37.5度和37.6度了，身体发软。
Today, a resident phoned to tell me that he was sick, had a fever of 37.5 degrees and 37.6 degrees, and was weak.
前两天武汉气温有点冷，我在想他是不是感冒了，就告诉他我先汇报一下。
Wuhan two days ago a little cold temperature, I wonder if he caught a cold, tell him that I report first.
我跟领导反映后，和居民沟通，联系了医院，派车送他过去。
I talked to the leader, talked to the residents, contacted the hospital, and sent a car to see him off.
。
.
晚上6点多，我跟着配送队去给居民免费配送菜。
At 6 pm, I followed the distribution team to deliver food to the residents for free.
我们这里除了大型超市，所有的营业场所都关闭，包括外卖。
All our business premises are closed except for large supermarkets, including take-out.
。
.
为了保障居民的日常生活，每天我们会提前联系居民，统计好菜的数量和种类，联系超市把包装好的菜送过来，我们负责往各个小区投放。
In order to protect the daily life of the residents, we will contact residents ahead of time, check the number and type of good dishes, contact the supermarket to send the packaged dishes, we are responsible for the delivery of various small areas.
因为小区不让大车进入，我们还特意找了一台小货车负责送菜到各小区。
Because the small area does not allow large cars to enter, we also specially found a pickup truck responsible for delivering vegetables to the community.
到了小区以后，不能让居民集中来拿，我们还得一个一个地打电话，让他们逐个拿走。
When we got to the community, we couldn't let the residents gather to get it. We had to call one by one and ask them to take it one by one.
通常一天能给100多户居民配送菜。
More than 100 households are usually served vegetables a day.
。
.
有些老人上下楼不方便，我们就会送到他们家门口，跟他们打个招呼喊一声。
Some of the old men went downstairs inconveniently, and we would send them to their door and shout at them.
老人们会给我们道谢，夸我们社区服务好，我们也很欣慰。
We are glad that the old people will thank us and praise our community service.
。
.
社区的工作人员有口罩、消毒液、有酒精，还有手套。
Community workers have masks, disinfectants, alcohol and gloves.
我们的口罩不是N95口罩，很薄，一般每人一天用一到两个，不能浪费，现在一线医务人员紧缺口罩，我们得省着用。
Our masks are not N95 masks. They are very thin. They are usually used by one or two people a day. They cannot be wasted.
。
.
我们现在基本上防护用品还足够，对于之前没买到口罩的居民，我们也会送一部分给他们，保障他们的需求。
We basically have enough protective gear now, and we give some to residents who haven't bought masks before to protect their needs.
。
.
刚开始启动工作的时候，我们的工作没有理顺，比较紧张。
At the beginning of the start of the work, we did not straighten out, more nervous.
我们觉得人手少、特别累，之后发动志愿者、党员，慢慢地人就多了，工作也慢慢理顺了，工作效率也加快了。
We feel small, especially tired, after the mobilization of volunteers, party members, slowly more people, the work slowly straightened out, work efficiency has been accelerated.
我感觉一直到今天才稍微轻松点，现在主要工作是注意动态、宣传还有摸排疑似病例。
I feel a little relaxed until today, now the main work is to pay attention to the dynamics, publicity and mapping suspected cases.
。
.
居民现在也比较理解、支持我们的工作，在微信群、电话里都会给说我们辛苦了。
Residents are now more understanding, support our work, in the micro-group, telephone will be said that we worked hard.
我们很感动，因为我们的工作得到了老百姓的肯定。
We are very moved, because our work has been recognized by the people.
。
.
我从没有担心自己会感染，干社区工作10多年了，我们总是在第一线。
I've never worried about being infected. We've been in the front line for more than 10 years.
现在只希望疫情能够早点控制住，不要再出现新增病例。
It is hoped that the outbreak will be brought under control soon and that no new cases will occur.
。
.
我今年都50岁了，有糖尿病、腰椎也不太好，有时工作上忙，也很吃力。
I am 50 years old, have diabetes, lumbar spine is not very good, sometimes work busy, also very hard.
我女儿比较担心我，她每天会跟我打电话，问我累不累，要我在外面做好防护措施。
My daughter was worried about me. She would call me every day and ask me if I was tired and take precautions outside.
等疫情结束后，不用隔离了，我想跟家人好好团聚。
After the outbreak is over, I don't need to be quarantined. I want to be reunited with my family.
