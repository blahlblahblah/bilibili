深度和角度——这就是我们能做的。
Depth and angle - that's what we can do.

我们在郊区，离洪湖市区大概还有8公里左右，再加上春节期间置办了许多年货，蔬菜都是自家地里摘，所以基本上吃饭没有太大问题。
We're in the suburbs, about 8 kilometers from Honghu City, and we have a lot of New Year's Eve purchases. Vegetables are picked from our own fields, so basically there is no big problem with eating.
口述 | 余　光整理 | 陈　冰1月18日，儿子放寒假的第一天，我们一家三口开了14个小时的车，回到我出生的地方——湖北省洪湖市螺山镇（隶属于湖北省荆州市）。
At the beginning of my son's winter vacation on January 18, my family of three drove 14 hours to return to the town of Luoshan, Hubei province, where I was born (part of Jingzhou, Hubei Province).
洪湖市，以我们这边最大的湖泊——洪湖命名，距离武汉市约100公里，是个户籍人口只有93万余人的县级市。
Honghu City, named after Honghu, the largest lake on our side, about 100 kilometers from Wuhan city, is a county-level city with a population of only 930,000.
当时湖北的疫情还没有通报出来，如果知道情况那么严重，我们肯定就不回来了。
The outbreak in Hubei had not been reported at that time. If we had known the situation was so serious, we would certainly not have returned.
回到家，疫情一天比一天严重。
Back home, the epidemic is getting worse every day.
1月23日小年夜晚上，洪湖市新冠肺炎疫情防控指挥部发布了六号令，全面启动突发公共卫生事件二级响应，实行交通管控，市内公共交通停运，高速公路入口三检合一，取消聚集性活动。
January 23rd Fine On January 23, the Honghu Municipal New Crown Pneumonia Prevention and Control Command issued six orders, fully activated the public health emergency secondary response, traffic control, the city's public transport disruption, the integration of the three highway entrance inspection, and the cancellation of aggregation activities.
我们所有的家庭聚餐、拜年活动都取消了。
All our family dinners and New Year visits have been cancelled.
1月25日，大年初一，洪湖市发布了第 12号令：从1月25日10时起封闭全市公路进出口通道，车辆人员禁止通行，特殊车辆除外。
January 25, the first day of the Lunar New Year, the city issued a decree No. 12: January 25 from 10: 00 to close the city's road entrance and exit passageways, vehicular personnel are not allowed to pass, except special vehicles.
这意味着洪湖也“封城”了。
This means that the Honghu Lake is also "closed".
目前，我们一家三口加上我父母五个人在一起生活了二十多天了。
So far, our family of three plus my parents have been together for more than twenty days.
因为我们在郊区，离洪湖市区大概还有8公里左右，再加上春节期间置办了许多年货，蔬菜都是自家地里摘，所以基本上吃饭没有太大问题。
Because we are in the suburbs, about 8 kilometers away from Honghu City District, in addition to the Spring Festival to buy a lot of new year goods, vegetables are home-grown harvest, so basically there are no major problems with eating.
乡村的道路都封了，私家车没法通行，而且加油站都关闭了，乡镇之间的交通也封闭了，有交警值守。
The roads in the countryside are blocked, private cars are impassable, petrol stations are closed, and traffic between towns is closed to traffic police.
现在，外面的人进不来，里面的人出不去，只有电动车还能通行，大家都知道外面危险，没事儿也不会乱跑，最多出去买点水果什么的。
Right now, people out there can't get in, people can't get out, only electric cars can pass, everybody knows it's dangerous outside, nothing's wrong, no running, no more fruit or anything.
乡下居民没那么密集，所以觉得乡下比市里面相对安全一些。
The countryside is not so densely populated that it feels safer to live in the country than in the city.
关键时刻，村干部穿着防护服上门，挨家挨户根据人数发放口罩，每天都上门测量体温，村里的大喇叭天天都是关于疫情的消息，我觉得措施还算到位吧，而且一次性口罩没限购，我妈去村卫生所买了一袋，50个，感觉可以用很久了。
Key moment, village cadres wearing protective clothing door-to-door, according to the number of people issued masks, every day to take temperature, village loudspeakers are daily news about the epidemic, I think measures are in place, and disposable masks are not restricted, my mother went to the village clinic to buy a bag, 50, feel can be used for a long time.
昨天（2月9日）我们村确诊了一个新冠肺炎病人，全村人都知道了。
Yesterday (February 9) our village diagnosed a new crown pneumonia patients, the whole village know.
我问消息怎么传得那么快，他们说防疫部门确诊以后马上就打电话给村里，后来确认这个人户口在这里，全家住市区，近期根本就没回来过。
I asked how the news spread so quickly. They said they called the village immediately after the diagnosis, and later confirmed that the person was registered here, that the family lived in the city and that he had never been back recently.
所以，迄今为止，我们村子还是安全的。
So far, therefore, our village is safe.
隔壁村有一个确诊的，是年前从武汉回来的，一下子隔离了三十几个密切接触者，现在他们的隔离陆续解除，回来了。
The next village has a confirmed, was returned from Wuhan years ago, a sudden isolation of more than thirty close contacts, now their isolation gradually lifted, back.
之前村子上的一些人还骑着电动自行车跑到隔壁的村子打牌，总觉得疫情离自己很远，后来都觉得传染起来挺可怕的，不出去打了。
Some people in the village had been riding electric bicycles to play cards in the next village, feeling that the epidemic was far away from them and that it was terrible not to go out and fight.
但是整天闷在家里肯定还是很无聊的嘛，村子里一些人还是会聚在一起打牌，我就怕他们要是传染上了……2月9日，市里又发了通知，实行居民临时通行证制度，一户一证，确有出村（社区）的，凭身份证和临时通行证出入，每户每三天可派1人外出，每次由村（社区）的防控检查点（门岗）负责核签，划勾；在暂定范围内，因公需要的，还要出具单位加盖公章的证明。
Some people in the village will still get together and play cards, so I'm afraid that if they catch the card, the city will issue a notice on Feb. 9, a temporary resident pass system, a family card, a village (community) can be sent out every three days, each time the village (community) control checkpoint (gate) check-off, and for official needs, the unit stamp certification.
我老家房子屋前屋后比较宽敞，白天我陪儿子做作业，看看电视，天气好的时候就在门口晒太阳，或者去门口的河里钓会儿鱼，消遣消遣。
During the day, I do homework with my son, watch TV, bask in the sun at the door when the weather is good, or go fishing in the river at the door for a while for recreation.
2月10号本来是我在上海的公司开工的日子，但因为交通全部中断了，我们也不可能自驾回去了，只能远程把公司的工作安排好了——部分员工复工，复工名单上报区里，区里控制复工员工数量。
February 10 was supposed to be the start date for my company in Shanghai, but with all the traffic cut off, we couldn't get back on our own and had to arrange the company's work remotely - some of the employees went back to work, the list of workers was reported to the district, and the number of workers returned to work was controlled.
我们是做汽车相关零部件研发验证类相关检测设备的，疫情对公司的影响还是蛮大的，订单都没法按时交付，人工成本一分也不能少，我正在和财务沟通，看看上海新出台的28条能够帮冲抵掉什么成本，相信政府能够帮助我们小微企业一起共度时艰。
We are doing research and development of auto-related parts testing equipment, the impact of the epidemic on the company is still very large, orders can not be delivered on time, labor costs can not be reduced, I am in financial communication to see if the new 28 can help offset the costs, I believe the government can help us small and micro enterprises together.
不管怎么说，我还能浮生偷得半日闲，过一下“采菊东篱下，悠然见南山”的新乡村生活，所以并不是太焦虑，其实焦虑了也没用。
In any case, I was able to steal half a day off, after a "chrysanthemum hedgerow, leisurely see Nanshan" life in the new countryside, so not too anxious, in fact, no use anxious.
也不知道还要封锁多久，天天关注新闻动态，感觉荆州的情况有好转，有关部门还是负责任的。
Do not know how long the blockade, daily follow the news developments, feel Jingzhou situation has improved, the relevant departments are still responsible.
再坚持一下，我们一定能够战胜疫情。
One more time, we will be able to overcome the epidemic.
