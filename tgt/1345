2月5日，湖北随州下辖的县级市广水市在官网挂出一份求助信《SOS！！！广水紧急求援！！！》：广水市人口95万人，医疗资源极其匮乏，全市仅有两家纳入三级管理的二甲医院，目前已不堪重负，恳请国家、省市尽快向广水派出医疗队。

2月6日下午4点50分，玉山县中医院ICU主任刘建华接到通知，自己将作为江西省援鄂医疗队的一员前往湖北随州下辖的县级市广水，支援抗疫一线。
At 4: 50 p.m. on February 6, Liu Jianhua, director of the ICU in Yushan County Chinese Hospital, was told that he would go to the county-level city of Guangshui, under the jurisdiction of Suizhou Province, Hubei Province, as part of a medical team to support the fight against the epidemic.
没有丝毫犹豫，当天下午他就从玉山赶往南昌集合，当晚便坐上了由南昌飞往武汉的飞机，于7日凌晨一点多抵达武汉，又从武汉坐车前往随州。
Without hesitation, that afternoon, he rushed from Yushan to Nanchang to gather, that night sat on a plane from Nanchang to Wuhan, arrived in Wuhan at 1: 00 a.m. on the 7th, and from Wuhan to Suizhou.
经过一路奔波，直到2月7日凌晨4点半，刘建华和江西医疗队的同事们终于抵达了随州。
After a long journey, Liu Jianhua and his colleagues from the Jiangxi Medical Team arrived in Suizhou at 4: 30 a.m. on February 7.
在随州紧急培训一天后，2月8日上午10点，刘建华和同事们坐车从随州赶往广水。
After a day of emergency training in Suizhou Province, Liu Jianhua and his colleagues drove from Suizhou to Guangshui at 10 a.m. on February 8.

刘建华被分配到广水市第二人民医院开展新冠肺炎患者救治工作，“广水是随州病人数量第二多的县级市，且病人主要集中在广水市第一人民医院和广水市第二人民医院，两家医院的治疗压力非常大。
"Guangshui is the county-level city with the second highest number of patients in Guangzhou, and the patients are mainly concentrated in the First People's Hospital of Guangshui City and the Second People's Hospital of Guangshui City.
广水市第二人民医院一共有5个病区，我和另外4名同事负责第一病区的治疗，该区有20多个病人，其中3人病情危重。
The Second People's Hospital in Guangshui City has five sick areas. Four other colleagues and I are in charge of the treatment of the first case.
”据刘建华向澎湃新闻（www.thepaper.cn）介绍，该院第一病区此前由本院的两名医生和两名护士负责，在交接之后，就由江西医疗队的5名医务人员顶替他们，“我们来这里以前，该院的医护人员已经坚持了二十多天，肯定是很累的。
"Before we came here, the hospital's paramedics had lasted more than 20 days and must have been very tired," Liu told Peng Pai News (www.thepaper.cn), where two doctors and two nurses from the hospital had previously been in charge.
”令刘建华印象深刻的是，2月11日晚上，一位30多岁的重症病人看到他来后很高兴，不停地对他说，“感谢江西人！”刘建华和医疗队同事们的合影。
Liu Jianhua was impressed when a critically ill patient in his 30s saw him on the night of February 11 and kept saying to him, "Thanks to the Jiangxi people!" Liu Jianhua and his medical colleagues took a group photo.
刘建华告诉记者，“虽然来到一线很危险，但这也是我们应该做的，做好医生的本职工作，就是对抗击疫情的最大支持。
Liu told reporters, "Although it is dangerous to come to the line, but this is what we should do, do a good job of doctors, is the greatest support to fight the epidemic.
我也想请我的妻子和女儿放心，我会保护好自己。
I also want to reassure my wife and daughter that I will protect myself.
”犹记得离开玉山那天，刘建华坚决不让妻子和女儿到医院送别，“因为这样的离别真的很难过，我不愿让她们看着我离开。
"" I remember leaving Yushan the day Liu Jianhua firmly refused to let his wife and daughter go to the hospital.
”面对丈夫主动请战奔赴一线的决定，刘建华的妻子希望丈夫可以心无旁骛地出征，不愿展现脆弱的一面让他担忧。
"Faced with her husband's decision to go to the frontline, Liu's wife hopes that her husband will be able to concentrate on the battle instead of worrying about being vulnerable.
她强压下心头的不安，默默将寓意“平安吉祥”的苹果和橘子放进丈夫的行李中。
She pressed her uneasiness and silently put the apples and oranges, which meant "peace and good luck," into her husband's luggage.
离别的近十个日夜里，她寝食难安，看着湖北此前不断攀升的确诊人数，心疼穿着厚厚的防护服一天工作10小时的丈夫，还要安慰因害怕而哭泣的女儿。
During the last ten nights of absence, she was unable to sleep or sleep, watching the number of confirmed cases in Hubei province, grieving her husband, who worked 10 hours a day in thick protective clothing, and comforting her daughter, who wept with fear.
2月14日，情人节，她把对丈夫的担忧、思念与祝愿都写成了文字，写下一封信，献给正在一线抗疫的丈夫刘建华。
On February 14, she wrote down her worries, thoughts and wishes about her husband. She wrote a letter to her husband, Liu Jianhua, who was struggling against the epidemic.
澎湃新闻在征得刘建华的妻子同意后，刊载此信。
Peng Pai news after obtaining Liu Jianhua's wife to agree, published this letter.
【老公，今天请允许我脆弱下】当得知你请战支援湖北的那一刻，我的心似乎一下停止了跳动，可是我知道我不能阻止你。
[Husband, please allow me to be vulnerable today] When I learned that you asked for support Hubei the moment, my heart seems to stop beating, but I know I can't stop you.
抗疫救人，是一名合格的医务人员的本份。
It is the duty of a qualified medical worker to fight against the epidemic.
那么多医务人员夜以继日奋战，奔跑着跟病毒抢时间、抢生命，“你不要去”，这句话我怎么说得出口。
So many medical personnel fight day and night, running with the virus to seize the time, snatch life, "you do not go," I said.
你说，这么危险的事情，我不能让别人去，必须自己去。
You said, such a dangerous thing, I can not let others go, have to go.
老公，那一刻我对你肃然起敬。
Husband, I respect you at that moment.
我强压下心头的难过和不安，默默地为你收拾行囊。
I press down the heart of sadness and uneasiness, quietly pack up for you.
一时间，我只觉得行李箱为什么不够大！穿的装不下，吃的也装不下，更装不下我的牵挂……当你把我费尽力气装进去的东西，又整理出来的时候，当你不解风情地把我偷偷藏进去寓意着平安吉祥的苹果和桔子都拿出来时，我真的想大声地哭一哭。
For a moment, I just feel that the suitcase is not big enough to wear, food can not be loaded, more can not load my care... When you put my best efforts to put things out, when you covertly hide me with the message of safe auspicious apples and oranges come out, I really want to cry loudly.
可是我不能哭，我不能在你面前脆弱，我不想让你牵挂我们，我要你心无旁骛地出征。
But I can't cry, I can't be vulnerable in front of you, I don't want you to worry about us, I want you to stop fighting.
你即将奔赴一线，已经身负千斤，我不能再给你加担。
You're on your way to the front. I can't put you on top of that.
当你接到紧急出发的通知之时，我的声音和手是颤抖的，我的心更是狂跳着。
My voice and hands trembled and my heart beat wildly as you were notified of the emergency departure.
我低头故作幽默地对你说，几步路而已，就不送了。
I bow my head humourously to you, just a few steps away, do not send.
其实，那时我的眼泪已经在发红的眼框里打转，可是我不能让你看到我眼底里深深的不舍和担忧，只好在心里默默地念着：我的爱人，加油，早日平安归来。
In fact, at that time my tears have been in the red frame of the eyes, but I can not let you see my eyes deeply reluctant and worried, had to quietly read in my heart: My love, refueling, early and safe return.
从知道你要支援湖北至今，近十个日夜里，我寝食难安。
From knowing that you should support Hubei so far, nearly ten days and nights, I sleep hard.
在湖北每天确诊人员不断攀升的数据公布时，当被感染的医护人员越来越多时，当一队队援助人员又纷纷奔赴武汉时，当孩子因担心恐惧哭泣，我紧紧拥抱给她安全感时，当你我年迈的妈妈纷纷哭泣着向我倾诉她们的担忧，我却要故作轻松安慰她们时，我依然坚强着。
I was still strong as the data on the rising number of daily confirmed cases in Hubei Province reached me, as teams of aid workers rushed back to Wuhan, children cried in fear, I hugged her with security, and my elderly mother cried out their fears to me, and I tried to console them.
但是，老公，当我看到你进行了十来个小时的工作，拖着疲惫、沉重的脚步，摘下口罩，露出布满深深勒痕的脸颊，却笑着对我说，“没事，没事，我很好”时，我好想对你说，今天，就请允许我脆弱下。
But, husband, when I saw you do a dozen hours of work, dragging tired, heavy feet, take off your mask, reveal deep scars on the cheek, and smile and say, "Nothing, nothing, I'm fine," I really want to say to you, Today, please allow me to be vulnerable.
可否让我暂时卸下坚强的外壳哭泣一下，哭出我的担心，哭出我的牵挂，就让我脆弱那么一下下，隔着屏幕拥抱下你一下。
Can I temporarily unload the strong shell crying, crying out my fear, crying out of my care, let me fragile so for a moment, across the screen hugging you.
亲爱的，你真的受累了，你真的真的要在治愈别人的同时，保护好自己！因为你是我们这个家的顶梁柱，你更是所有医护人员的表率，你是大家的骄傲，你更要用你的双手去救护更多的人。
Dear, you are really tired, you really want to heal others, protect yourself! Because you are the pillar of our family, you are a model to all health care workers, you are proud of everyone, you have to use your hands to rescue more people.
我的爱人，我们等你平安凯旋。
My love, we await your safe return.
