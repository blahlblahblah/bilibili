对于目前农产品市场整体运行情况，农业农村部部市场与信息化司副司长宋丹阳在新闻发布会上介绍，新冠肺炎疫情发生后，从全国情况来看，重点“菜篮子”产品市场供给总体充足，市场运行基本平稳，市场价格有涨有跌。

此前有报道称，部分养殖企业遭遇饲料短缺问题，疫情对家禽业影响有多大？农业农村部畜牧兽医局局长杨振海表示，疫情发生以来，活禽交易市场关闭，饲料、禽苗、活禽运输受阻。
Yang Zhenhai, director of the Livestock and Veterinary Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said the market for live poultry had been closed and the transport of feed, poultry and live poultry blocked since the outbreak.

”杨振海表示。
Mr Yang said.
杨振海介绍，目前已经初步排除新冠肺炎来源与已知家禽家畜的关系。
Yang Zhenhai said the relationship between the source of new crown pneumonia and known livestock had been preliminarily excluded.
农业农村部将协调有关部门实行活禽交易市场分类管理，组织屠宰企业与家禽养殖场户进行对接，实行集中屠宰上市，确保活禽不压栏。
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development will coordinate relevant departments to implement the classification management of live poultry trading markets, organize slaughtering enterprises to dock with poultry farm households, and carry out centralized slaughtering and marketing to ensure that live poultry are not put under pressure.
在保障饲料供应方面，杨振海表示，截至2月17日，全国9711家饲料企业，已经有6384家开工复产，开工率是66%，但是企业开工率与常年同期相比还有一定差距，不过 “只要交通问题解决，慢慢就会恢复正常，供给总量应该是没有问题的。
As of February 17, 6,384 of 9,711 feed enterprises had resumed production, with a start rate of 66 percent, but the start-up rate of enterprises was still a long way from the same period of the previous year, although "as long as the traffic problem is solved, it will gradually return to normal and the total supply should be OK."
”值得关注的是，今年以来湖南邵阳和四川南充发生两起家禽高致病性禽流感疫情，杨振海对此表示，目前我国禽流感无论是禽间还是人间发生率都非常低，大家没有必要“谈禽色变”，可以放心食用经检疫合格、合法上市的禽产品。
In response to two outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry in Shaoyang, Hunan, and Nanchong, Sichuan Province, this year, Yang said the incidence of avian influenza in China, both among poultry and among people, was very low.

经当地卫生健康部门监测，密切接触人员目前临床均健康，采样监测均为阴性。

“据专家分析，这两起疫情由野鸟传播的可能性比较大，可以说是‘祸从天降、毒自鸟来’，这也警示我们，重大动物疫病病原污染面广、传播途径多，防控难度大，决不可以掉以轻心。
"Experts say the two outbreaks are more likely to be spread by wild birds. They are a warning that major animal epidemics cause widespread pollution, spread many ways and are difficult to control and must not be taken lightly.
”杨振海说。

农业农村部种植业管理司司长潘文博在新闻发布会上还透露，受新冠肺炎疫情影响，今年春耕备耕也遇到了一些新情况新问题。
Pan Wenbo, director of crop management at the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, also said at a news conference that spring ploughing had encountered some new problems due to the outbreak of the disease.
潘文博介绍，当前不少地区农资企业开工需要当地疫情防控指挥部批准，加上工人、技术人员不能及时到位，企业正常复工复产率比较低。
Panwenbo said that many regional agricultural enterprises need the approval of the local epidemic prevention and control command, and workers and technicians can not arrive in time, enterprises normal return to work production rate is relatively low.
其次，农资到村到店难，目前种子、化肥、农药等农资供应总量是足够的，但运销最后一公里受阻，难以进店进村，有的地方反映，农药经营门店备货量还不到往年的一半。
Second, farm inputs to villages and shops are difficult. The total supply of agricultural inputs, such as seeds, fertilizers and pesticides, is currently sufficient, but the last kilometre of distribution is blocked, making it difficult to get into the village, and in some cases it is reported that pesticide stores are less than half of what they used to be.
此外，一些地方农村防疫搞“一刀切”，甚至封村堵路，禁止农民下田，也禁止农机上路，比如春茶采摘、蔬菜采收等，这些农事活动都无法正常开展。
In addition, some local rural epidemic prevention "across the board," even blocking the village roads, farmers are prohibited from going to the fields, agricultural machinery such as spring tea picking, vegetable harvest, etc., these agricultural activities can not be carried out properly.
特别是当前农业用工贵、用工难问题也比较突出，也影响了一些规模经营主体的正常农事活动。
