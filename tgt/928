我在武汉周边，正在用尽全力正常生活。
I am living a normal life with all my strength around Wuhan.

从武汉“封城”的那一天起，我们的生活便开始以“14天”为单位计算。
From the Wuhan "seal" of the day, our lives began to count as "14 days."
而武汉这座城市，也一直在人们视线聚焦的最中心。
Wuhan, the city, has always been the focus of attention in the most central.
除夕夜，春晚舞台上唯一没彩排过的节目里，喊出了第一声“武汉加油”；大年初一，全国多支医疗队赴援武汉；27日晚8点，全武汉的市民自发在窗边唱起《我和我的祖国》；28日，钟南山院士在采访时含泪感概：“武汉本来就是一个英雄的城市”；……2月2日，火神山正式交付，2月3日正式收治病人；2月5日，雷神山投用；2月7日凌晨，李文亮医生在武汉市中心医院去世。
On New Year's Eve, the only program on the stage did not rehearse, shouted out the first "Wuhan refueling"; on the New Year's Day, many medical teams from across the country came to Wuhan; 27 evening, the citizens of Wuhan spontaneously sang "I and my motherland" in the window, February 2, the official delivery of Luoshen Mountain, February 5, Li Wenliang died in the early morning of February 7.
武汉人在关注和帮助下，蹒跚走过“第一个14天”，在武汉的900万人知道，这14天，我们走得多不容易。
Wuhan people in the attention and help, hobbled through the "first 14 days," in Wuhan nine million people know that these 14 days, we have not been easy to walk.
2月7日，中国医疗界的“四大天团“在武汉会师，在“第二个14天”里，武汉无疑仍是焦点。
February 7, the Chinese medical community "four days" in Wuhan meet, in "the second 14 days," Wuhan is no doubt still the focus.
数据表明：离开武汉的500多万人中，有近半数回到了武汉周边城市。
Figures show that nearly half of the more than five million people who left Wuhan returned to cities around the city.
但与此同时，大家可能忽略了，这14天同样走得艰难的，还有300多万离开武汉，回到武汉周边的“新武汉人”。
But at the same time, you may have overlooked that these 14 days also difficult, and more than 3 million people left Wuhan, back to Wuhan around the "new Wuhan.
平时，他们在我们身边，工作学习、成家立业，和我们一起建设武汉。
Usually, they in our side, work and study, set up a family, with us to build Wuhan.
现在，他们在哪里？这14天，过得还好吗？元宵节，“第二个14天”开始的第二天。
Now, where are they? How are you these 14 days? Lantern Festival, the second day of the "second 14 days."
黄星洋从村里的敲锣人那里得知，隔壁湾子里的一个小姑娘没了，就二十来岁。
Huang Xingyang learned from the village gongs, next door in the Gulf where a little girl is gone, just about 20 years old.
同一天，黄星洋的爸爸，统计完了每家每户需要的物资，交由村委会统一采购。
On the same day, Huang Xingyang's father, the statistics of each household needs of the material, given to the village committee unified procurement.
元宵节当天，村委会第一次统计村民所需物资因为父母常年在老家，家里有粮食储备，自家还种了些菜，黄星洋家受封路的影响还不大。
On the day of the Lantern Festival, the village committee counted the villagers' needs for the first time. Because their parents lived in their hometown all year round, they had grain reserves at home and they planted some dishes.
“但有的是外地回来的，根本没买很多口粮。
"But some came back from other places and didn't buy a lot of food rations at all.
卖菜的差不多都不营业了，守路人也不轻易让人出去，我不知道那些没口粮的人能撑多久，他们吃的有多寒酸。
Almost all the vegetable sellers are closed, and the passers-by don't let people out easily. I don't know how long those who don't have food will last, how shabby they are.
”湾子里的一家小店还在卖菜，虽然蔬菜已经蔫了，还是有人去买。
A small restaurant in the Bay Area is still selling vegetables, but some people are wilting to buy them.
“也不知道它还会开多久。
"" I don't know how long it's going to last.
好在村委会开始统计物资需求了。
Fortunately, the village committee began to count the material needs.
”黄星洋家的物资储备算十分充足的了黄星洋所在的湾子直到大年初三才开始封路，通往镇上的主路，连通隔壁湾子的路都被拦断。
Huang's material reserves were plentiful until the third day of the New Year, when the main road to the town was blocked, and the road to the adjacent bay was blocked.
大石块、 拦腰砍断的树、土堆……曾被用作铺路的材料都变成了拦路的工具。
Big rocks, cut-off trees, dirt heaps... The materials that were used to pave roads have become tools for blocking them.
进出湾子的路口，值班人守着路，敲锣人喊着“冇事莫出门，出门戴口罩”，一个湾子一个湾子的穿梭，宣传。
In and out of the Wan Chai junction, watchman guarding the road, gongs shouted "no matter do not go out, out wearing a mask," a Bay Area Shuttle, propaganda.
湾子的不同出口都设有“关卡”严密的“封锁”举措，每天有人上门测量体温……虽然黄星洋所在的湾子，在第一个14天过去后没有确诊和疑似病例出现，但大家都很警觉。
Each of the Gulf Coast's different outlets has a tight "blockade," with a daily temperature check... Although Huang Xingyang lives in the Bay Area, no confirmed or suspected cases have emerged since the first 14 days, but everyone is alert.
“毕竟人命关天，隔壁湾都有确诊的，能不重视吗？”街坊邻居不再串门，往年大规模打牌的场景没有了，在家门口活动遇到熟人，都保持着8米开外的距离简单问候，然后各回各家。
"After all, the lives of people, the next bay are diagnosed, can not take it seriously?" Neighborhood no longer visit the door, the large-scale game of cards in the past year did not meet acquaintances, activities in front of the door, maintain a distance of 8 meters simple greetings, and then return to their homes.
没有年味的村落，现在反倒令人心安。
A village without age is now more reassuring.
因为口罩有限，短暂外出的村民靠保持距离保证安全第一个14天过完了，年也过完了。
With the limited number of masks, the first 14 days of safety for villagers who had been away for a short time passed, and the year was over.
黄星洋不会因为长辈要去亲戚家串门的事情红脸，他更担心的是武汉的情况，“小区也封闭了那大家怎么采购物资？不能跨区收治，能保证所有患者都能被收治吗？”从朋友圈了解到身边的亲友暂时平安，在抖音上看不到他想要的“真相”，黄星洋重新刷起微博来，试图离“真相”近一点。
Huang Xingyang won't be red-faced because his elders are going to visit relatives and friends. What worries him more is the situation in Wuhan. "Can't we buy things across districts and ensure that all the patients are treated?"
大量的求助信、未被收入医院的人……看到医院护士哀哭的视频，近而立之年的黄星洋哭了。
A large number of letters for help, not into the hospital... see the video of the hospital nurses wailing, nearly the year of Huang Xingyang crying.
“种种情况都表明，武汉的情况还是很不好，而且短时间内，可能不会好起来。
"Everything indicates that the situation in Wuhan is still very bad, and may not be well for a short time.
”1月19日，皮皮和老公的100多位亲友，从哈尔滨、广州、武汉等地赶到黄冈，参加完皮皮的婚礼后，又各自返回家乡。
On January 19, Pippi and her husband's 100-strong family and friends arrived in Huanggang from Harbin, Guangzhou and Wuhan.
当所有亲友结束旅程，打开家中电视看新闻时，在武汉爆发的“可防可控”“有限人传人”的新冠肺炎，出现了“人传人”的现象，并有“15名医护人员感染”。
The outbreak of preventable controllable "person-to-person" pneumonia in Wuhan caused a "person-to-person" phenomenon and infected "15 medical personnel" when all family members and friends finished their journey and turned on their TV sets to watch the news.
“现在想想，还是后怕。
'Now think, or be afraid.
好在来过的亲友里，没有感染的人。
Fortunately, the relatives and friends who have come, there are no infected people.
”在得知疫情可能比想象中更早扩散，并且更严重时，刚结束不久的婚礼，成了皮皮担忧的事。
Pippi worried when he learned that the outbreak might have spread earlier than expected and, worse, that the wedding had just ended.
当地的疫情和政府的相关举措，成了皮皮格外关注的事情。
The local epidemic and the government's efforts to do so are matters of particular concern to Pip.
皮皮在婚礼当晚，发朋友圈感谢了到场的亲友黄冈，距离武汉75公里，是湖北省内疫情严重程度仅次于武汉的城市。
On the night of the wedding, Pippi friends thanked relatives and friends Huanggang, 75 kilometers away from Wuhan, the only city with the worst epidemic in Hubei province.
70万从武汉返乡的人群，让黄冈这个经济欠发达的地区有了“最有可能成为第二个武汉”的风险。
The 700,000 people returning home from Wuhan put Huanggang, an economically underdeveloped region, at risk of becoming the second Wuhan.
1月29日，“绝不能让黄冈成为第二个武汉！”的口号，让和皮皮一样的黄冈人看到了希望。
January 29, "Huanggang must not become a second Wuhan!" slogan, let the Huanggang people like Pippi see hope.
但第二天，在电视上“一问三不知”的卫建委主任，又让这句口号在黄冈人心中变成了问号。
But the next day, in the TV "ask three questions do not know" the director of the health committee, let this slogan in the hearts of Huanggang into a question mark.
来不及深究卫建委主任为何会做出如此反应，皮皮很快就关注到了黄冈市快速上涨的确诊病例数量。
It was too late to delve into why the head of the health committee reacted in such a way that Pippi quickly focused on the rapidly rising number of confirmed cases in Huanggang.
“这个时候的数据，我感觉才是真实的。
"At this point in time, I feel real.
因为据我所知，黄梅县每天都有二三十例的新增确诊病例。
Because as far as I know, there are twenty or thirty new confirmed cases every day in Huangmei County.
”2月1日24时，黄冈新增确诊病例276例，累计确诊病例1002例（数据来源：澎湃新闻），成为继武汉之后第二个确诊病例破千的城市。
At 2400 hours on February 1, 276 new cases were confirmed in Huanggang, a cumulative total of 1,002 confirmed cases (source: Peng Pai News), making it the second city after Wuhan to break through a thousand confirmed cases.
“第一个14天”结束时，皮皮已经在线上复工。
By the end of the "first 14 days," Pippi had returned to work online.
此时还在小池镇上的她，既是新婚的新娘，也是在小池镇关注着疫情的普通黄冈人。
She was still in the town of Kochi, both a newly married bride and a common Huanggang watching the outbreak in Little Pond.
当日子还没按14天为一个阶段开始计算时，皮皮和好友许下过“暴富”的心愿，“不加班”也能让他们满足。
Before the start of the 14-day period, Pippi and his friends promised to be "very rich," and "not working overtime" would satisfy them.
在“第一个14天”开始后，“积极健康地活着”成了他们最大的心愿。
"Active and healthy living" became their greatest wish after the first 14 days.
“过好第二个14天，更为重要。
"A second 14 days is more important.
如果没有度过（难关），后面还会有N个14天。
If you don't get through it, there will be another 14 days.
这种不确定性，让人害怕。
This uncertainty is frightening.
”1月11日，回到洪湖近一周的橙子，看到了天上又大又圆、即将满月的月亮。
"On January 11, returning to the oranges in Honghu for nearly a week, he saw the moon in the sky, which was large and round and about to reach its full moon.
半个月后，除夕，新月。
Half a month later, New Year's Eve, new moon.
凌晨三点，橙子躺在床上，因为担心一线医护人员而辗转难眠。
At three in the morning, oranges lay in bed, tossing and turning for fear of front-line medical staff.
橙子1月11日的朋友圈：“你看着月亮它又大又圆”1月23日，抗“疫”的“第一个14天”开始了。
Orange Day 11 friend circle: "You look at the moon it is big and round" January 23, the "first 14 days" of the disease began.
橙子的高中同学建了一个微信群，取名“惜命青年保平安”。
Orange students built a micro-group of high school students, named "save lives of young people safe."
此时的“平安”二字，对于群里的11个年轻气盛的00后来说，比自由更可贵。
At this time, the word "peace", for the group of 11 young and magnificent 00 later said, more valuable than freedom.
疫情，也成为他们每天关注的焦点。
The epidemic is also the focus of their daily attention.
医护人员的鼻梁脸颊被口罩磨破的照片、一线工作者被感染的消息、不断增长的确诊和疑似病例……闭上眼，这些画面和数字就开始在脑海里浮现。
Pictures of doctors and nurses with their nose and cheeks gashed by masks, news of front-line workers being infected, growing numbers of diagnoses and suspected cases... close your eyes and these images and numbers begin to come to mind.
没有了以往热闹，夜里的洪湖格外安静，橙子内心那些担忧、焦躁的声音却最大。
Without the previous bustle, the Hong Lake at night is particularly quiet, the orange heart of those worried, anxious voice is the largest.
“我怕得睡不着”“我不睡了我真的无法入睡了……”“可怜、弱小、无助（表情包）”……2月6日，“第一个14天”结束。
I really can't fall asleep... "" Poor, weak, helpless [expressive bag]... February 6, the end of the first 14 days.
从29日开始，就只在白天分享生活日常，很少在晚上发朋友圈的橙子，在晚上10点多，转发了《洪湖加油》——一条由2个洪湖青年制作完成的视频——到朋友圈。
From the 29th, we only share our daily life during the day, rarely hand out oranges around our friends in the evening, and at more than 10 pm, we forward "Hong Lake refueling," a video produced by two Hong Kong youths, to a circle of friends.
Play《洪湖加油》拍摄制作：刘成杰 王宇豪“以往回家的必经之路没有了车辆行人，”视频里的洪湖“陷入了深度寂静”。
"Hong Lake refueling" filming: Liu Chengjie Wang Yu Hao "used to go home the only way to the road no vehicles pedestrians," the video of the Honghu "into a deep silence.
早上的玉沙路上没有了排队买豆皮的人，傍晚的荷花广场没了结对跳广场舞的阿姨们……橙子拍摄的洪湖江滩公园的露天KTV但在两位洪湖青年看来，“这种寂静也代表着洪湖力量”。
There were no queues for pea skins on the morning road, and the lotus square in the evening didn't end with the aunts dancing on the square... Orange shot of the open-air KTV in Honghu Beach Park but, according to the two Hunghu youths, "this silence also represents the power of the lake."
医护人员守在前线，当地志愿者们定点帮扶，交警坚守道路关卡，广西南宁驰援洪湖200余吨果蔬，还包括3.1万盒广西特产螺狮粉……图片截取自《洪湖加油》短片2月7日，“第二个14天”开始的第一天，洪湖版“小汤山”开始收治患者。

洪湖新增确诊病例2例，是这15天来，新增病例最少的一天。
Two new cases were confirmed in Honghu, the lowest number of new cases in the past 15 days.
那天夜里的洪湖依旧安静，橙子的内心也少了焦躁。
The lake was still quiet that night, and the heart of the oranges was restless.
“给你们看我的工作台！我就是从广州东塔回乡的Zoe”，被困天门的抽抽，在第一个14天开始的1月23日，投奔进了天门设下的“天罗地网”里，原以为和广州是匆匆一别，结果一困，就是二十多天。
"Show you my workbench! I am from Guangzhou East Tower Zoe," trapped by the Tianmen Square start on January 23, the first 14 days of the "TianLuodian network," originally thought and Guangzhou is a hasty farewell, the result is more than 20 days.

住在50年前盖的老房子里，室内没有厕所，只有户外的露天茅厕。
Living in an old house built 50 years ago, there was no toilet in the house, only outdoor latrines.
没有淋浴，只有大澡盆，房子四处漏风，甚至有些屋顶还会漏雨。

"The biggest difficulties are cold, the air is cold, the body is cold, the keyboard is cold and the network is not good.
”从初三开始就有工作任务的抽抽，很难坐下安心工作，工作效率只有平常的1/5。
Since the beginning of junior high school, it is difficult to sit down and settle down to work, and the work efficiency is only one-fifth of normal.
“领导在群里push我们签约，而我来月经连澡都洗不了，卫生巾去哪买也不知道！一套衣服穿了十几天都没换……”刚到天门的前几天，因为咳嗽了几声，抽抽被隔离到了更偏僻的房子里。
"The leader in the group push we sign, and I came menstruation even bathed can not wash, sanitary towels where do not know! A suit of clothes for more than 10 days did not change......" just arrived Tianmen a few days ago, coughing, was isolated into a more isolated house.
面对着一片荒地打开电脑，抽抽收到了次日线上开工的通知。
In the face of a wasteland opened the computer, pumping received the next day on the line of notice.
抽抽的床和办公桌旁的火盆平常生活就很简单的抽抽，对物质要求并不高。
Smoke the bed and desk next to the fire basin ordinary life is very simple smoke, material requirements are not high.
困在村里的她，也只是想洗个热水澡，换掉穿了十多天的衣服，踏踏实实地工作。
Trapped in the village, she also just want to take a hot bath, change the clothes worn for more than ten days, work steadily.
“第一个14天”里的抽抽，不止一次发出“我真的好想回城里”的感慨。
"The first 14 days" in the smoke, more than once issued "I really want to go back to the city" feeling.
如果这是一出“变形记”，抽抽经历的够多了。
If this is a "metamorphosis," too much has been done.
还能抽上烟，是她为数不多的快乐。
Being able to smoke was one of her few pleasures.
“第二个14天”开始，从镇上给抽抽一家送食物的大舅，也被困在了村里，连换洗的衣服都没带。
"The second 14 days" began, from the town to smoke a food uncle, also trapped in the village, even with no change of clothes.
村里的隔离越来越严，抽抽却越来越淡定。
The isolation of the village became tighter, but the fumes grew more and more quiet.
困了20多天，抽抽第一次走到村口。
Sleeping for more than 20 days, he first walked to the village.
“前天出太阳，我去姨妈家洗了个澡，回来以后喝了一杯可乐。
"The day before yesterday, I went to my aunt's house to take a shower, and when I came back, I had a coke.
超级开心！”工作上依然有很多困难，但此时的抽抽会选择出门去田间走走，“捡捡柴火，跟着舅妈去田里偷点菜。
"There are still a lot of difficulties at work, but at this point the pump will choose to go out and walk around the fields," pick up firewood and follow my aunt to the field to steal some food.
我现在可会生火啦！”抽抽的“变形记”还在天门进行，虽然不知道还会继续多久，但她很少再向朋友抱怨村里生活的不便。
I'm about to start a fire! "The" Transfiguration "was still going on in Tianmen Square, but she rarely complained to her friends about the inconvenience of living in the village.

We bought 60! "The desire was low and the threshold for happiness became even lower.
第二个14天已经开始，Didi第二次产检的日子过去的越来越久。
The second 14 days had already started, and the days of Didi's second visit were getting longer and longer.
但现在的她，还是连门都不敢出。
But now she is still afraid to go out the door.
1月7日，怀孕三个月的Didi，去医院做第一次产检时，已经戴起了口罩。
On 7 January, Didi, three months pregnant, went to the hospital for her first check-up and had already put on a mask.
“12月底，我从朋友那里得知，武汉已经有44个左右的感染者了。
"At the end of December, I learned from my friends that Wuhan already has about 44 infected people.
”虽不能确定消息的真实性，但对朋友的信任，和对宝宝的保护，让初为人母的Didi还是警觉了起来。
While the veracity of the information is uncertain, the trust in friends and the protection of the baby have alerted the new mother, Didi.
她提醒老公出门戴口罩，并囤了一些口罩。
She reminded her husband to go out wearing a mask, and hoarded some masks.
一个月前的“小道消息”被实锤，疫情在往超过预想的方向发展着。
A month ago "rumors" were hammered, and the epidemic was headed for more than expected.
怀着孩子的Didi始终不敢相信，这一切是真实发生在自己身上的。
With the child Didi has always been unable to believe that all this is really happening to themselves.
“我怀着宝宝，为什么就让我们碰上了呢？这明明是电影里才会有的场景，竟然在现实生活中遇到。
"I am pregnant with a baby, why let us encounter it? This is clearly the only scene in the film, actually encountered in real life.
”“不串门，不舞龙舞狮……”窗外的大喇叭全体滚动播放着疫情相关的警示口号，街上空无一人，静得出奇。
"Do not visit the door, do not dance the lion......" The big trumpet outside the window was rolling with warning slogans about the epidemic, and the streets were empty and strangely silent.
透过窗户看到的外面，Didi总觉得不真实。
Outside through the window, Didi always feels unreal.
特别不喜欢宅在家里的Didi，总是喜欢到处走走看看，“哪怕换一个房间把我隔离都好，就是不要让我在一个地方呆太久。
In particular, Didi, who doesn't like being in the house, likes to wander around, "Even if it's nice to isolate me in a different room, it's not going to keep me in one place too long."
”不能出门的Didi，用看电影的方式，把自己放在不同的世界里。
"Didi, who can't go out, puts himself in a different world by going to the movies.
《传染病》《流感》……和这次疫情相似的电影，Didi都看了一遍。
"Infectious Diseases," "Influenza..." And this film, similar to the epidemic, Didi read.
在现实生活中真实体验过电影里的种种后，Didi还是选择一遍遍的复习动画里的美好。
After experiencing the movie in real life, Didi still chooses over and over to review the beauty of animation.
“我以后应该不会和孩子讲我此时经历的疫情，我希望给讲美好的东西。
"I'm not going to talk to my kids about the epidemic I'm going through at the moment," he said.
毕竟这个世界上，还是美好比较多。
After all, the world is still better than more.
”Didi新结识的三个新朋友：吉米、黑妞、黑宝尽管物资采买没那么便利，但餐桌上总有Didi爱吃的菜。
"Didi's three new friends: Jimmy, Nigel, and Blackberry Despite the lack of convenience, there was always a Didi favorite on the table.
三只分别叫吉米、黑妞、黑宝的小狗成了Didi新的插画主角，老公也从没陪伴在身边这么久……一窗之隔，里外都是真实世界，Didi希望窗外的时间流走，眼前的时间留下。
Three puppies named Jimmy, Black Girl, and Blackberry became Didi's new interlude, and his husband never stayed with him for so long... A window separated by the real world, inside and outside, and Didi wanted time to run out of the window and time to stay.
“我是个恋家的人，在武汉都会每半个月要回一次同在黄石的家，和妈妈两三天就要视频一次。
"I am a lover, in Wuhan every half a month to go back to the same home in Yellowstone, and my mother two or three days to video.
”第二个14天已经开始，Didi想回家了，想和妈妈像以往一样聊工作、聊生活，分享画的画。
"The second 14 days had already started, and Didi wanted to go home, talking about work, life, and painting with his mother as usual.
“想过回正常的生活。
"Want to go back to normal life.
”这是当下Didi最朴素的愿望。
This is Didi's simplest wish at the moment.
Didi习惯将自己画的画分享给妈妈1月23日10时，仙桃和武汉同步“封城”。
Didi used to share his paintings with his mother January 23 10: 00, the peach and Wuhan synchronous "closure".
1月19日就回到老家仙桃的刘老师，见证了仙桃是如何一步步地被“隔离”的。
Mr. Liu, who returned to his native peach home on January 19, witnessed how the peach was "quarantined" step by step.
仙桃“封城”的当天，市内街道上的红绿灯全部亮起了红灯，小区和小区之间的道路上，也有车辆拦截。
On the day that the peach was "closed," traffic lights were red on the city streets, and cars were stopped on the road between the neighborhood and the neighborhood.
再后来，“本户有武汉返乡的成员，请勿来往”的封条越来越多的出现在一些人家的门口。
Later, "this family has Wuhan returned to the members, do not travel" Seal more and more appeared in the door of some homes.
与“风暴中心“的频繁交流，使得仙桃保持着极高的警觉性。
Frequent communication with the Storm Center keeps the peach extremely alert.
人口流出量高达40.35万人（2017年数据）的仙桃，每家每户都有和刘老师情况相似的人在外地务工、上学。
Exodus 403,500 people (2017 data) of the peach, each family has a similar situation as Miss Liu in the field of migrant workers, school.
距离100多公里、开车不到2小时的武汉成了许多仙桃人的第二故乡，巨大的人口流动在两城之间发生。
Wuhan, more than 100 kilometers away and less than two hours by car, has become the second home of many peaches, with huge population movements taking place between the two cities.
因为疫情的发生，仙桃和武汉的地面连接被阻断，但两地的往来没有被切断。
As a result of the outbreak, the ground connection between the peach and Wuhan was blocked, but the two places were not cut off.
陆运不行，空运顶上。
No ground transportation. Airlift top.
2月1日下午5点37分，载着3000多套防护服和2.4万余只医用口罩的直升机降落在新华路体育馆。
At 5.37 p.m. on February 1, a helicopter carrying more than 3,000 protective suits and more than 24,000 medical masks landed in the Xinhua Road Stadium.
3天后的中午12点半，装着3万只口罩的直升机再次从仙桃机场起飞。
Three days later, at 12: 30 noon, a helicopter with 30, 000 masks took off again from Sendai Airport.
同样的“空中联结”，也在刘老师和31个武汉家庭中发生：线上询问孩子和家长的健康状况，录制亲子游戏视频、绘本故事分享到微信群中。
The same "aerial connection" occurred in Liu's and 31 Wuhan families: online questioning of children's and parents' health, videotaping of parent-child games, and sharing of picture stories with microphone groups.
屏幕里的可爱孩子们，让刘老师迫不及待想回到武汉，开始工作。
The lovely children on the screen, let Miss Liu eager to return to Wuhan, began to work.
线上教学的第一天，也是刘老师想上班的第一天—“第一个14天”已经结束，“第二个14天”已经开始。
The first day of online instruction, the first day Miss Liu wants to work - the "first 14 days" have ended and the "second 14 days" have begun.
在过去的二十多天里，除湖北外省份确诊病例数连续7日下降。
In the past 20 days, the number of confirmed cases outside Hubei province declined for the seventh day in a row.
但湖北省内的确诊和新增疑似病例仍在波动中增加。
But diagnoses and new suspected cases in Hubei province are still on the rise.
湖北人共同面临的，是一场“持久战疫”。
Hubei people face a common, is a "protracted war epidemic."
武汉不是唯一战场，战疫也不只发生在医院里。
Wuhan is not the only battlefield, and the epidemic is not confined to hospitals.
每一个拼尽全力维持正常生活的平凡湖北人，都是坚守防线的战士。
Every ordinary Hubei people who make every effort to maintain normal life are the soldiers holding on to the defense line.
把每一个14天都过好，不容易。
It is not easy to live each 14 days well.
但过过去，我们就赢了。
But over the years, we won.
