作者 | 第一财经吴绵强一场导致湖北多地“封城”的肺炎疫情，影响了武汉周边乡镇农村基层地区人们的过年气氛。
First Finance & amp; Finance & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
与往年人们忙碌地贴对联、贴年画、挂灯笼，鞭炮声此起彼落相比，今年的新年，这些村镇到处封路，家家户户紧闭大门，村民足不出户，目的是为了阻断肺炎疫情的施虐传播。
Compared to the days when people busily pasted couplets, pasted New Year's pictures, hung lanterns and set off firecrackers, this year's New Year was marked by blockades in these villages and towns, with doors shut down and villagers staying at home in an attempt to stop the spread of pneumonia.
与武汉市区严峻的疫情防控形势相比，乡镇和农村基层亦是疫情防控的第一道防线。
Compared with the severe situation of epidemic prevention and control in Wuhan, towns and rural grass-roots are also the first line of defense against the epidemic.
连日来，记者走访武汉市周边地区的乡镇、农村等地区发现，基层的防控形势存在短板。
In the past few days, reporters visited the surrounding towns, villages and other areas of Wuhan City, grass-roots prevention and control situation is short board.
据记者调查，基层疫情防控的压力主要包括居民防护意识淡薄、基层医护人员不足和防护设备短缺等。
According to the reporter survey, the pressure of grass-roots epidemic prevention and control mainly includes the weak sense of protection of residents, insufficient primary-level medical personnel and shortage of protective equipment.
“光量体温人手就忙不过来”自1月23日武汉市宣布封城之后，疫情防控的形势传导到武汉市的郊区——新洲区。
"Since January 23, Wuhan announced the closure of the city, the situation of disease prevention and control to Wuhan's suburbs - Xinzhou District.
这里是武汉市东北部的市辖区，东邻黄冈市团风县，西接武汉市黄陂区，南与武汉市洪山区、鄂州市华容区隔江相望。
This is the municipal district of northeast Wuhan city, Lianfeng county of Huanggang city in the east, Huangpi district of Wuhan city in the west, Hongshan district of Wuhan city and Huarong district of Huangzhou city across the river.
“发现从武汉回来的人员，我们要入户调查，检查他们是否发烧、体温是否正常，每天都要上报，目前这几天‘还好’，未发现发烧、发热以及（疑似冠状病毒肺炎）这样的病例。
"If we find out that the people coming back from Wuhan have a fever and temperature, we have to report it every day. We have not seen any cases of fever, fever or [suspected coronavirus pneumonia] in these days.
”新洲区邾城街道办事处下辖的某村村支书刘明对记者说。
New ZhouZhouzheng District Office under the jurisdiction of a village branch Liu Ming said to reporters.
记者注意到，刘明所在的新洲区地域位置正好处在疫情较为严重的武汉市以及黄冈市之间。
The reporter noted that Liu Ming's Xinzhou area is located in the more serious epidemic situation between Wuhan and Huanggang City.
新洲区被中国建筑业协会授予“中国建筑之乡”称号，全区有十几万人在武汉市乃至全国从事建筑行业。
Xinzhou has been awarded the title of "Township of Chinese Architecture" by the China Construction Industry Association.
邾城街道办事处下辖十余个社区、几十个行政村，有着大量的在武汉乃至全国的外出务工人员。
Zhengcheng Street Office under the jurisdiction of more than 10 communities, dozens of administrative villages, there are a large number of workers in Wuhan and even the country.
此次新冠病毒肺炎的基层防控工作，给刘明和他的同事带来压力。
This new crown virus pneumonia grass-roots prevention and control work, to Liu Ming and his colleagues bring pressure.
“我们提前在腊月二十九，就已跟村里各队队长打了招呼，春节期间不要串门、拜年。
"We have been in advance of the 29th, the village team leaders have said hello, Spring Festival do not visit the door, New Year call.
”刘明告诉记者。
"Liu Ming told reporters.
事实上，在基层乡镇、村的疫情防控中，村民小组组长往往是最前线的排查人员，组长们知道各家各户的情况，便于摸排。
In fact, in the grass-roots towns, villages in the prevention and control of the disease, the leader of the village group is often the front-line inspectors, leaders know the situation of each family, easy to map.
据记者了解，新洲区有3家专门的发热门诊，但下辖的村里没有这种的专门门诊，也没有足够的技术手段对发热病人进行筛查诊治等，组长们需要不断在村民微信群里叮嘱“近期若有发热，全身乏力，呼吸道干咳或呼吸困难等症状请随时检查并就诊”。
According to the reporter, there are three special fever clinics in Xinzhou district, but the villages under their jurisdiction do not have such specialized clinics, and there are not enough technical means to screen and treat febrile patients.
“现在遇到有发热的病人，要转至新洲区人民医院以及新洲区中医院进行血液检查。
"People's Hospital in Xinzhou and Xinzhou District should be referred for blood tests if they have fever.
”刘明介绍，村里几人去村卫生室买药时被发现的发热症状，随后送往新洲区进行了检测，在确定未感染疫情的情况下，村里还是要求他们在家自我隔离，更不能接触家人和外界人员。
"Liu said several people in the village went to the village clinic to buy medicine when the fever symptoms were found, and then sent to Xinzhou District for tests.
刘明告诉记者，该村共计有村民3000人左右。
Liu Ming told reporters that there were about 3,000 villagers in the village.
与突如其来的巨大防疫压力不相称的是，全村只有一个村卫生室，卫生室只有2名医护人员。
Not commensurate with the sudden and overwhelming vaccination pressure, there is only one village health room and only two health workers in the health room.
平常村民看病、买药都去这个卫生室。
Usually the villagers go to the clinic to see doctors and buy medicine.
比如对全村人员体温的测量工作，该卫生室村医程医生明确告诉记者，他无法每天逐一挨家挨户上门给村民检测体温，“这也不现实，根本人手不够，也缺防护设备。
For example, the village doctor told reporters that he could not carry out house-to-house temperature checks every day. "It is unrealistic, it is simply not staffed and there is a lack of protective equipment.
”诚然，3000人左右的自然村，每人用小型医用温度计去测量并不现实。
To be sure, in a natural village of about 3,000 people, it is unrealistic to measure each person with a small medical thermometer.
据一名村干部介绍，每人量5分钟，每天早晚共量2次，“这个工作量太大，光量体温人手就忙不过来。
According to a village cadre, each person measures 5 minutes, morning and evening total 2 times, "this is too much work, light temperature hand-held busy.
”防护物资奇缺同样的问题，出现在鄂东某镇，镇干部李波告诉记者，体温检测在当地亦存在难覆盖的问题，他们正在等待上级部门能调来红外体温检测仪等设备。
"The same problem occurred in a town in eastern Hubei, where Li Bo, a senior official, told reporters there were problems with body temperature testing and were waiting for higher-level authorities to bring in equipment such as infrared thermometers.
“现在最怕的是有些村民自己出现发热、发烧等症状以及疑似冠状病毒肺炎病例，藏着掖着，不主动去医务室。
"What I fear most is that some villagers have their own fever, fever and other symptoms as well as suspected cases of coronavirus pneumonia, hidden, not actively to the infirmary.
”刘明对记者说，如果不及时与村委会反映，他们难以立刻知晓，并解决病情问题。
"If they don't report it to the village committee in time, it's difficult for them to know immediately and solve the problem," Liu told reporters.
“在疫情防护方面，应该是人人都要戴口罩，但是村民的防护意识还比较淡薄，这存在很大的弊端。
"In terms of epidemic prevention, everyone should wear masks, but the villagers' sense of protection is still weak, which has great drawbacks.
”程医生告诉记者。
"Dr. Cheng told reporters.
在多位村干部看来，想调来红外体温检测仪其实是“奢望”，目前最基本的防护口罩都出现短缺。
In the view of a number of village officials, the infrared temperature detector is really "extravagant hope," the most basic of the current shortage of respirators.
程医生说，他所在的卫生室一直短缺口罩，N95口罩以及一般的医用外科口罩比较紧缺。
Cheng said there has been a shortage of face masks in his clinic, and a shortage of N95 masks and general medical surgical masks.
“前天村里每家每户只发了十几个普通医用外科口罩，严格的说一般四五口的家庭一天用量都不够。
"The day before yesterday, only a dozen general medical surgical masks were distributed to every household in the village. Strictly speaking, the average family of four or five is not enough for one day.
”刘明也告诉记者，“按照村里的人口，每天普通口罩的使用量在6000只左右，但前几天仅来了2000只口罩。
"According to the village population, about 6,000 face masks are used every day, but only 2,000 came the other day," Liu told reporters.
”1月27日，李波所在的乡镇终于等到了上面调拨而来的口罩。
On January 27, Li Bo's township finally had to wait for a mask to be redeployed from above.
但是全镇几十个自然村，每村仅限发百余只口罩。
But the town dozens of natural villages, each village only limited to a hundred masks.
“这批口罩，应该也只够村干部下去巡查时使用。
"These masks should only be used when village officials go on patrol.
”李波表示。
Mr Li said.
在疫情防控之际，其实还需要在村子内外喷洒消毒液，进行人员密集场所的消毒。
At the time of epidemic prevention and control, it is necessary to spray disinfectant inside and outside the village to disinfect densely populated areas.
但是这项工作，似乎就没有做到位。
But this work does not seem to be in place.
“洗手、消毒措施跟上还比较困难。
"Washing hands and disinfecting hands are difficult to follow.
”程医生告诉记者，现在到处封路，购买极其不便，还要等到上面援助。
Dr Cheng told reporters that the road was now blocked everywhere and that it would be extremely inconvenient to buy them and wait for help.
除了这些防护短缺之外，救护车的短缺，亦使得转移新冠病毒肺炎疑似病人存在难题。
In addition to these protection shortages, the shortage of ambulances has made it difficult to transfer suspected patients with Newcastle virus pneumonia.
新洲区邾城街卫生院院长高新武告诉记者，一般遇到高度疑似病人，他们就会进行集中转移，当地设置了隔离站。
Gao Xinwu, director of the Zheng Street Medical Center in Xinzhou, told reporters that when patients are highly suspected, they will focus on relocation and set up local isolation stations.
“在病人转移到隔离站的过程中，我们的员工只能用自己的轿车。
"Our employees had to use their own cars while the patients were being moved to the quarantine station.
”高新武介绍，现在当地处于封城状态，一般机动车禁行，难以找到合适的运输车辆，即使找到了，花钱雇车也没人敢来运输。
Gao Xinwu said the area is now closed to traffic, general motor vehicles are prohibited, it is difficult to find suitable transport vehicles, even if found, paid for cars do not dare to transport.
“我们的医务科科长李军只有穿着防护设备上阵，转移了好几批。
"Our chief of medical services, Li Jun, had to wear protective equipment and moved several batches.
”高新武说。
"said Gao.
记者在高新武发来的图片中看到，李军穿着防护服驾驶机动车。
Reporters in Gao Xinwu sent pictures, Li Jun wearing protective clothing to drive motor vehicles.
最难防控的是“人”“在外地的人员想回来，返乡的务工人员想出去，群众的防范意识还是比较差。
The most difficult to control is "people" "people in the field want to return, returning home workers want to go out, the masses of prevention awareness is still relatively poor.
”1月26日，大年初二，仍奔忙在疫情防控一线的上述鄂东某镇干部李波对记者说。
On January 26, the second day of the Lunar New Year, Li Bo, a cadre in an eastern Hubei province who is still busy with the epidemic prevention and control, told reporters.
李波所在的地区距离疫情中心武汉市有200余公里，车程三四个小时。
Li Bo is in an area more than 200 kilometers from Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic, three or four hours by car.
武汉的严峻疫情之下，当地的防控态势不容小觑。
Wuhan under the severe epidemic situation, the local situation of prevention and control can not be underestimated.
春节假期，李波都在镇政府加班，他们整个乡镇的工作人员这段时期也全部在岗。
During the Spring Festival, Li Bo worked overtime in the township government, and his entire township staff were on duty.
李波每天都要整理镇里统计上来的防控工作形势，以及对“密切接触者”的观察情况和统计返乡人员整体情况，及时向县里汇报。
Li Bo every day to collate the township statistics on the prevention and control work, as well as "close contacts" observation and statistics on the overall situation of returnees, timely reported to the county.
随着武汉市的封城指令下达，周边地区亦陆续跟进。
With the Wuhan city closure order issued, the surrounding areas have been followed up.
疫情防控的指令，从省里到武汉市乃至周边地市的各乡镇，往往需要一定时间。
Outbreak control orders, from the province to Wuhan and surrounding cities and towns, often take a certain amount of time.
据记者了解，湖北各乡镇的疫情防控工作，真正展开大约就在1月23日，即农历腊月二十九。
According to the reporter, the township of Hubei disease prevention and control work, really started around January 23, that is, Lunar New Year 29.
李波所在的乡镇，位于偏僻的大别山腹地，农村外出务工人员较多。
Li Bo in the township, located in the remote hinterland of Dabie Mountain, rural migrant workers more.
除夕之前的几天是返乡高峰，许多在外地务工的人员直接或绕道武汉回家。
Before New Year's Eve a few days before the return home peak, many workers in the field directly or via Wuhan home.
腊月二十九，当地新冠病毒疫情防控指挥部就已下发指令，所有班线客运、公交，出租车停止运营。
Lunar 29, the local new crown virus epidemic control command has issued a directive, all liner passenger, public transport, taxi stop operation.
从武汉返乡人，都成了村干部们这个春节的“工作对象”。
From Wuhan returnees, have become the village cadres this Spring Festival "work object."
“现在最大的压力还是人员流动防控，外地回村务工人员想逃离。
"The biggest pressure is on the movement control and migrant workers want to flee.
”并且在武汉留守的人，最近也偷偷跑回村里来。
"And those left behind in Wuhan have recently sneaked back to the village.
当地一名乡镇干部告诉记者。
A local township official told reporters.
当地有一家3口人，从武汉回到家，被邻居发现遂向村里汇报。
A local family of three returned home from Wuhan, was found by neighbours and reported to the village.
“镇里分管防控工作的负责人得知消息，立即与村干部一起上门，将他们隔离在家中。
"When the chief of control in the town heard about this, he immediately went to the village officials and isolated them in their homes.
”上述镇干部告诉记者，目前还未发现他们身体出现什么问题。
The township officials told reporters that no physical problems had been detected.
在外出务工人员之外，本地人的风俗习惯“难克”亦是摆在基层疫情防控干部面前的一道难题。
In addition to migrant workers, the local customs "difficult to overcome" is also placed in the grass-roots disease control cadres face a difficult problem.
现在正值春节，村民免不了要拜年、聚会。
It is Spring Festival now, the villagers will inevitably visit the New Year, party.
据记者了解，春节相互拜年是当地农村人的风俗，一般晚辈要去长辈家拜年。
According to the reporter understand, Spring Festival mutual New Year is the local custom of rural people, the general younger generation to visit the elderly family.
“不准组织各类集会，不相互走动、拜年，出门一律戴口罩，不信谣、不传谣，对不听劝告者由行政主管部门依法处理。
"No assemblies of any kind, no moving about or visiting the New Year, no mask when going out, no rumors, no rumors, and no administrative departments shall handle cases of non-compliance with the law.
”当地指挥部发布的相关通知称。
The notice issued by the local command said.
尽管如此，仍有村民要去拜年。
Despite this, some villagers still want to pay a New Year call.
据记者了解，虽然鄂东地区对县里、镇里流动人员管控和交通管制等发出了具体通知，逐一发布到下辖的自然村，并且有村干部作了广泛宣传，“但是仍有一些村民认识不够高，亲戚之间走动拜年的现象亦存在。
According to the reporter, although the eastern Hubei area to the county, the town mobile personnel control and traffic control issued specific notices, one by one issued under the jurisdiction of the natural village, and a village cadres widely publicized, "but there are still some villagers not high enough awareness, relatives between the phenomenon of New Year visits.
”防控难点还有到处行驶的车辆，李波所在的县到乡镇，已设置了几个卡点，管控人员流动，“但有些居民还不是按照要求活动，人员管控方面还是有一定的压力。
Among the control difficulties are the ubiquitous vehicles and the fact that several checkpoints have been set up from Li Bo's county to the township to control the movement of people, "but some residents have not yet followed through and there is some pressure on personnel control.
”对此，为了阻止村民们相互拜年，当地乡镇的村干部或者村民志愿者，每天都要全天候的用大喇叭话筒、敲铜锣的形式，到各个村里去宣传，要求“不上门拜年，用手机拜年。
To prevent villagers from visiting each other for the New Year, village officials or volunteers from villages and towns used loudspeakers and gongs all day long to publicize the festival in every village.
”记者在武汉市远城区新洲区的农村地区探访发现，村里已将通知下发给各组组长，由组长逐一通知到每家每户，“不允许出门拜年，在家呆着。
A visit to a rural area in the far urban area of Xinzhou in Wuhan city found that the village had sent a notice to the group leaders, who informed each household one by one, "No more New Year visits, no stay at home.
