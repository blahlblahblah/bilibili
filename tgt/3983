凌晨，尿毒症患者小黄鸟终于做完了透析回到家；身在湖北的Iris突发胆囊疾病，因疫情生扛2天后终于决定就医；北京的周迎夫妇每日如坐针毡，不知道因疫情推后的恶性肿瘤手术何时能开始……抗击新冠肺炎是一场全民的战争。
In the early morning, the uremic patients finally finished their dialysis and returned home. Iris, who was in Hubei province, was suffering from gallbladder disease two days after the outbreak of the disease.
然而，在这场战争的另一面，我们生活的世界里还有许许多多其他病人。
On the other side of the war, however, we live in a world of many other patients.
抗疫硝烟之下，他们还好吗？凌晨1点，我终于透析完到家了凌晨1点多，刚做完透析的小黄鸟才回到家。
At 1 a. m., I finally got home from dialysis. It was more than 1: 00 a.m. before the yellow bird, who had just finished dialysis, returned home.
平日经过4个小时的透析，小黄鸟会在到家后点一份外卖当夜宵补充体力。
On weekdays, after four hours of dialysis, the little yellow bird orders a takeaway when it arrives home to refresh itself with supper.
但眼下小区为了防疫，严格控制人员进出，外卖员无法将餐食送到家门口。
But for now, the neighborhood for epidemic prevention, strictly control the entry and exit of personnel, take out food can not be sent to the door.
实在没力气下楼拿外卖和买菜做饭，综合衡量之下，小黄鸟选择泡面作为透析后的夜宵。
Really no energy to go downstairs to take away and buy vegetables to cook, under the overall measure, small yellow birds choose noodles as dialysis after supper.
血液透析是将血液抽出体外，经透析机去除患者身体不能自行清除的有害物质后，再将血液输回体内的治疗方式丨Wikipedia“平时透析不会做到这么晚的。
Hemodialysis is a treatment that takes blood out of the body and removes harmful substances that the body cannot remove on its own. It is not done so late in dialysis
”小黄鸟说。
"said the bird.
自从2015年底被确诊尿毒症后，小黄鸟每周一三五都要到医院进行血液透析。
Since the diagnosis of uremia at the end of 2015, the yellow bird has been in the hospital for hemodialysis on Mondays and Fridays.
医院的透析室有3个透析时段，早班8点开始，午班大概下午1点半开始，晚班下午6点半开始。
The hospital's dialysis room has three dialysis sessions, starting at 8 a.m., afternoon shift at about 1.30 p.m. and evening shift at 6.30 p.m.
为了减少对日常生活的影响，小黄鸟大都选择在晚上前往医院接受透析。
In order to reduce the impact on daily life, yellow birds mostly choose to go to the hospital for dialysis at night.
新冠疫情发生后，为了严防传染，医院要求所有前来透析的患者量体温、洗手、填表等等，每轮透析后还要对透析室进行消毒，因此晚班经常被拖到晚上8点、9点才能开始。
After the outbreak of the new crown, all dialysis patients were asked to take their body temperature, wash their hands, fill in forms, disinfect the dialysis room after each round of dialysis, so the evening shift was often delayed until 8 or 9 p.m.
透析中的小黄鸟丨受访者供图透析室人多、患者停留时间长、患者免疫力往往较低，这几个因素合在一起，要求血液透析室必须有更强的防疫措施，小黄鸟表示理解。
The combination of factors such as large numbers of small yellow birds in dialysis rooms, long duration of stay and low immunity of patients required greater precautions in hemodialysis rooms, understood by the birds.
虽然回家晚了一些，但好在这所医院一直没有停止提供透析治疗，小黄鸟和病友们也没有遇上太大的问题，“如果疫情持续，可以养成晚睡晚起的习惯来适应吧。
Although it was a little late, the hospital did not stop providing dialysis treatment, nor did the yellow birds and their sick friends experience major problems. "If the outbreak persists, get used to staying up late at night.
”我在湖北切胆囊荆州市是湖北省内最大的疫区之一，截止到2020年3月5日24时，这里累计有1580人被确诊患上了新冠肺炎。
As of 2400 hours on March 5, 2020, 1,580 people had been diagnosed with pneumonia in Jingzhou, Hubei Province, one of the largest epidemic areas in the province.
Iris和父母就住在这个城市的沙市区。
Iris and her parents lived in the downtown area of the city.
2月26日，Iris感到了难以忍受的背部疼痛和剧烈呕吐，但因为担心被传染新冠肺炎，所以拒绝了父母要带她去医院的建议。
On February 26, Iris felt excruciating back pain and vomiting, but rejected her parents' proposal to take her to hospital for fear of contracting pneumonia.
直到28日早上8点，因为疼痛已两个晚上未眠的Iris下定决心：“去他的疫情，必须去医院了！”武汉，排队就诊的患者丨ABC news根据荆州市卫生健康委员会公布的信息，2月20日以后，市内的急危重症、孕产妇、儿童、恶性肿瘤、血液透析等患者，都有医院可以接受，就医渠道得到了保障，但仍然不建议非急重症患者前往医院。
Iris, who had been in pain for two nights until 8 a.m. on the 28th, decided to go to the hospital for his disease, according to information released by the Jingzhou Health and Wellness Commission. After February 20, patients in critical condition, pregnant women, children, malignant tumors, hemodialysis in the city were admitted to hospitals.
然而，毕竟身在疫情期间的重灾区，就医总不是挂号排队等叫号这么简单。
However, after all, in the worst affected areas during the epidemic, access to health care is not so simple as waiting in line to call.
由于疫情原因，医院里很多通道封闭，母亲推着轮椅上的Iris绕来绕去，才做完了Iris的术前检查；患者和家属都要做的体温检查、胸部CT以及血常规检查，以排除新冠肺炎的可能性。
As a result of the outbreak, many of the passages in the hospital were closed and Iris in her wheelchair was wheeled around to complete Iris' preoperative examination; a temperature test, a chest CT and a routine blood test for both the patient and the family to exclude the possibility of new crown pneumonia.
荆州的一家医院丨受访者供图最终，Iris被诊断为胆囊结石和急性胆囊炎，需要立刻手术切术胆囊，“医生说还是该早点去的，再拖几天就没法用腹腔镜做微创手术了。
Ultimately, Iris is diagnosed with cholecystolithiasis and acute cholecystitis and requires an immediate surgical operation to remove the gallbladder. "Doctors say it's time to go early, and we can't perform laparoscopic minor surgery in a few days," he said
”Iris说。
'said Iris.
手术前的准备工作也比平时复杂：要实施腹腔镜手术，需要向麻醉科主任请示，再传达到院长一级进行审批；呼吸科也会参与进来，通过线上查看CT结果，再次确认手术患者没有感染新冠肺炎，“据说手术室都有些日子没用了”。
Preoperative preparation is also more complicated than usual: laparoscopic surgery requires consultation with the head of the anaesthesiology department, followed by referral to the director level for approval. Respiratory departments are also involved in checking CT results online to confirm that the patient is not infected with pneumonia.
Iris在医院丨受访者供图为了预防新冠病毒交叉感染，1间病房只能住1个病人，陪护家属也只能有1人。
Iris is allowed to live in a ward for only one patient and accompanying family members to prevent cross-infection of the new crown virus.
在母亲的陪护下，Iris的恢复挺顺利。
Chris's recovery went well, accompanied by his mother.
4天后，她出院回到家中，一边休养，一边继续过着足不出户的隔离生活。
Four days later, she was discharged from the hospital and went home to recuperate, while continuing to live in isolation.
不敢说我们还能不能等相比之下，北京的周迎（化名）夫妇经历着真正的煎熬。
Can't say that we can still wait for comparison, Beijing's Zhou Ying (pseudonym) couples experienced a real ordeal.
去年10月，周迎的丈夫被确诊为胃癌，进行了三期化疗后在家休养。
Zhou Ying's husband was diagnosed with stomach cancer last October and was given three chemotherapy sessions to recuperate at home.
按照原来的计划，周迎的丈夫会在春节后接受手术，在治疗的同时，也可以根据手术的情况确定下一步治疗方案，两人期待着手术能给病情带来好的转机。
Zhou Ying's husband was scheduled to undergo surgery after the Lunar New Year, and the two men expected the surgery to make a difference, depending on the circumstances of the operation.
谁也没想到，手术计划因为突如其来的疫情搁浅了。
No one expected the operation to run aground because of the sudden outbreak.
疫情期间，北京空荡荡的商场丨作者摄周迎夫妇的经历绝非个例。
The experience of Beijing's empty shopping malls into couples during the epidemic is by no means unique.
1月29日到2月3日，北京12345热线收到关于肿瘤治疗的问题就有36件[1]。
From 29 January to 3 February, Beijing's 12345 hotline received 36 & # 91; & # 91; 1 & # 93; & # 93; about oncological treatment.
北京大学肿瘤医院发布的《关于新型冠状病毒疫情期间肿瘤诊治的建议》中指出，中晚期肿瘤的手术等待时间对治疗结局影响较大，可以通过多学科会诊讨论调整治疗方案，尽早开始化疗等治疗；早期肿瘤患者病情进展较慢，延期手术的弹性更大一些。
According to the Recommendations on Tumor Diagnosis and Treatment during the Novel Coronavirus Epidemic Disease issued by Beijing University Oncology Hospital, it is suggested that the waiting time of mid-to-advanced tumors has a great influence on the outcome of the treatment.
周迎告诉果壳，疫情期间血库供应紧张，不一定能保障手术中的用血量，一旦失血非常危险，加上手术后住在病房里，疫情管控又是个问题，可别下手术台又染上肺炎，所以自己能理解医院的举措。
Zhou Ying told the shell that tight blood bank supply during the epidemic period may not guarantee the amount of blood used in the operation, once the bleeding is very dangerous, and after the operation in the ward, the disease control is a problem, do not get down the operating table and contracted pneumonia, so I can understand the hospital.
但身为患者的家人，内心如坐针毡的不安，又是真实存在的，“不是每个癌症病人都可以用手术来治疗，先生刚好有手术指征，我们真的不愿意这个机会拖着拖着就没了。
But as a patient's family, the innermost feelings of uneasiness are real. "Not every cancer patient can be treated surgically, sir, with surgical indications, and we really don't want this opportunity to drag and tear."
”微博“肺炎患者求助”话题中，有许多来自恶性肿瘤患者和家人的求助微博丨微博截图也不是没想过其他办法，“去其他医院看病的话，需要把各种检查再做一次，太耽误时间；去外地甚至外国就医也不是没考虑过，但国内疫情还没解除，近的日本、韩国，疫情也很严重，去哪儿都一样。
There is a lot of help from patients and their families on Weibo. "Going to other hospitals requires a second check-up, which is too time-consuming. Travelling to a foreign country or even to a foreign country is not a bad idea, but the epidemic is not over.
只能等，没办法，现在只能等。
Can only wait, no way, now can only wait.
”目前周迎丈夫的身体情况还算稳定，按照医嘱在家养病、锻炼，为不知何时的手术做着准备。
Zhou Ying, whose husband is now in stable physical condition, has been instructed to stay at home to recuperate from illness and exercise to prepare for surgery when he doesn't know when.
夫妇俩计划等到三月中下旬，如果那时还不能做手术的话，就必须得做其他决定了，“因为不敢说我们还能不能继续等下去”。
The couple planned to wait until the second half of March, and if they couldn't have surgery by then, they would have to make other decisions, "because we couldn't say whether we could wait any longer."
我的工作时间比平时更长作为患者和患者家人，看到的是治疗延误、科室停诊，但在医护人员看来，工作一刻也没有停歇。
I worked longer hours than usual as a patient and a family member, seeing treatment delays, administrative outages, but in the view of health care workers, the work never stopped.
就职于四川的一家医院老年科的医生黄燕妮（化名）告诉果壳，急诊科、感染科、ICU近半的医护人员已被调往防疫一线，同时外地进修医生因疫情不能来医院。
Huang Yanni, an elderly doctor at a hospital in Sichuan, told her husk that nearly half of the emergency, infection and ICU medical staff had been transferred to the frontline of epidemic prevention, and that doctors studying abroad were unable to come to the hospital because of the outbreak.
在防疫人手不足的情况下，不仅所有科室都需要参与新冠肺炎的初筛工作，“就连实习生、后勤人员也要帮忙量体温和分诊。
In the case of insufficient epidemic prevention staff, not only all departments need to participate in the initial screening of new crown pneumonia, "even interns, logisticians to help measure body temperature and diagnosis.
”武汉的一家医院，医护人员正在对患者进行治疗丨Reuters与黄燕妮的体验相同，北京的肿瘤科医生赵峰（化名）说：“其实我的工作时间比平时要长”。
At a Wuhan hospital, medical staff are treating patients through the same rules as Ms. Huang, said Zhao Feng, an oncologist in Beijing who works longer hours than usual.
即使不需要立刻进行的择期手术（如良性肿瘤切除）和限期手术（如恶性肿瘤切除）被推迟，一部分化疗患者因疫情暂停了治疗，也并不意味着这些科室的医护人员就放假了。
Even if immediate elective surgery (such as a benign tumor resection) and limited-term surgery (such as a malignant tumor) are delayed, the fact that some chemotherapy patients have been suspended from treatment due to the outbreak does not mean that the staff in these departments are off duty.
“除了转为前线和院内防疫外，大部分同事都在岗，不过换成了在网上工作”，赵峰说，“很多患者都急着来北京，但因为疫情来不了啊。
"Most of my colleagues are on duty, except for front-line and hospital immunization," Zhao said. "A lot of patients are eager to come to Beijing, but the outbreak is not coming."
我每天都要跟很多患者联系，帮忙沟通协调当地的医院，让他们就近治疗。
I have to contact a lot of patients every day to help coordinate the local hospital, so that they are close to treatment.
”疫情的隐性问题截止到3月5日，共有40000多名医护人员从全国各地前往湖北抗疫一线。
The hidden problem of the epidemic By March 5, more than 40,000 medical personnel had traveled from all over the country to the front line of the epidemic in Hubei Province.
黄燕妮承认，抽调医护人员支援湖北，确实会对当地患者就医造成影响，“除了关闭的科室外，可以来就诊的患者也会遇到问题，比如常来的慢性病患者找不到熟悉的医生，沟通效率就会变低；坐诊的医生少了，患者来了也要多等一段时间。
Wong admitted that the deployment of medical staff to Hubei did have an impact on local patients. "In addition to the closed departments, patients who can come to the hospital will also encounter problems. For example, patients with chronic diseases who cannot find familiar doctors will be less effective in communicating.
而且越是大医院，这种现象越明显。
And the bigger the hospital, the more obvious the phenomenon.
”香港的一家医院里，患者正在等候就诊丨CHINA DAILY“流行病会造成两类问题，一类是显性的，比如湖北迫在眉睫的疫情，大家在疫情的第一阶段就能注意到它、去解决它；还有一类是隐性的，到了第二阶段才会被人关注到，比如医疗资源集中于新冠肺炎。
At a Hong Kong hospital, patients are waiting to see the doctor into a DailY epidemic. "Epidemics cause two kinds of problems, one is overt, such as the impending outbreak in Hubei, which can be noticed and addressed in the first phase of the epidemic, and the other is hidden until the second stage, when attention is focused on, say, new crown pneumonia.
”中国社会科学院大学讲师苏春艳说。
Su Chunyan, a university lecturer at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
疫情爆发至今已近2个月，我们应该把更多的目光放到受隐性问题影响的群体身上，去打通一个帮助他们的通道，让隐性问题得到缓解，“举个例子，武汉的其他急病患者，可以离开武汉到其他省市去治疗吗？”苏春艳说，“我觉得是可以的。
Nearly two months after the outbreak, we should focus more on groups affected by hidden problems, open a way to help them and ease the hidden problem.For example, can other urgent patients in Wuhan leave Wuhan to go to other provinces and municipalities for treatment?
不一定是政府，还可以由一些非政府组织、民间组织来帮忙，政府给他们一些弹性的操作空间，让这些患者得到妥善的安置。
Not necessarily the government, but also some non-governmental organizations, civil society organizations to help them, the Government gave them some flexibility so that these patients can be properly placed.
”砖头不够的时候，拆东墙补西墙未尝不可，但位于东墙下的人，不应该忍受太久的寒冷：希望小黄鸟可以按时做完透析、到家吃一顿丰盛大餐补补身体，Iris今后再也不必因疾病流行耽误病情，更希望周迎的丈夫早日接受治疗，一家人幸福平安。
People under the East Wall should not endure the cold for too long: Hopefully, the yellow bird will complete his dialysis on time and eat a big meal at home. Iris will never have to delay his illness because of the epidemic.
