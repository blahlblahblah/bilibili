新冠肺炎病人有的早期发病并不是非常凶险，但是后期突然会一个加速，病人很快进入一种多器官功能衰竭的状态，会是一种炎症的风暴轻症病人不可掉以轻心本文转载自南方人物周刊文| 南方人物周刊记者 杨楠南方人物周刊实习记者 何沛芸 聂阳欣图| 复旦大学附属中山医院提供编辑|蒯乐昊周建平小年夜那天，上海中山医院重症医学科副主任钟鸣接到国家卫健委指令前往武汉参与抢救新冠肺炎的危重病人。
Early onset of new crown pneumonia may not be very dangerous, but then suddenly accelerates into a state of multi-organ failure. Patients can quickly enter a state of multi-organ failure.
他是第一个驰援武汉的上海医学专家，从接到任务到出发，只有一个小时。
He was the first Shanghai medical expert to reach Wuhan, only an hour from his assignment to his departure.
当晚他与广州、杭州的另两位专家乘高铁先抵达麻城，再由湖北省卫健委开车将他们接到武汉。
That night, he and two other experts from Guangzhou and Hangzhou took a high-speed train first to Massachusetts, then Hubei Wei Jiancheng drove them to Wuhan.
途径高速收费站，三位专家又换了一辆能够进入市区的车，方才抵达酒店。
At the high-speed tollbooth, the three experts switched to another car that was able to get into the city before arriving at the hotel.
1月24日，钟鸣进驻武汉金银潭医院开展工作。
On January 24, Zhong Ming entered the gold and silver pool hospital in Wuhan to carry out work.
金银潭是武汉第一批定点收治医院，也是武汉新冠肺炎危重症患者的主要选择之一。
Gold and silver pool is Wuhan's first designated hospital, is also Wuhan Xinguan pneumonia critical patients one of the main choices.
以下是南方人物周刊昨晚对钟鸣医生的独家专访。
The following is an exclusive interview with Dr Zhong Ming by Southern Personality Weekly last night.
小年夜那天，钟鸣乘高铁驰援武汉南方人物周刊：抵达金银潭后，您主要的工作内容是什么呢？钟鸣：当时金银潭已经有三位医疗救治专家组成员，然后又选派了我们三个人过来，具体完成临床一线的带组工作。
On the eve of the Lunar New Year, Zhong Ming rode on a high-speed railway to help the Southern Wuhan People's Week in Wuhan. What was your main job after arriving in the gold and silver pool? Bell-ming: There were already three medical experts in the gold and silver pool.
金银潭的重症医学科（ICU）在他们的南七楼，只有十六张床，但是病人远远超过这个负荷。
Gold and Silver Pool's Critical Medicine (ICU) On their seventh floor south, there are only 16 beds, but the patients far exceed that load.
当时医院打算开楼下两层，将普通病房改成临时ICU。
The hospital planned to open two floors downstairs and convert the general ward into a temporary ICU.
所以到我们去的前两天，临时ICU才刚刚把设备搬进去了。
So two days before we went, the temporary ICU just moved in.
我被安排在六楼，是危重病人最多的主战场，我带领湖北省各个地方前来武汉援助的医生、护士组成一个临时的治疗救治团队，收治当时病区里一半的危重病人，大概16个。
I was placed on the sixth floor, the main battleground for the most critically ill patients. I led doctors and nurses from all over Hubei province who came to Wuhan to provide assistance to form a temporary treatment team to treat half of the critically ill people in the area at the time, about 16.
我的团队里有三个ICU的医生，是从湖北各个地方支援来的，还有三个金银潭本院的非ICU医生辅助，还有一些护士。
My team included three ICU doctors, supported from all over Hubei, three non-ICU doctors from the hospital, and a number of nurses.
空荡荡的高铁列车上，钟鸣医生说：“家里人其实很担心，但他们已经习惯了”南方人物周刊：救治初期，您所面对的困难有什么？钟鸣：太多了。
On the empty high-speed train, Dr Zhong said: "The family is really worried, but they are used to it." What are the difficulties you are facing in the early stages of treatment?
首先这个病和过去我们SARS或者禽流感都不太一样，SARS很多时候是病人一上来病情就非常的重。
First of all, this disease is different from our past SARS or avian influenza. SARS is often very serious when the patient comes up.
但新冠病人有的早期发病并不是非常凶险，但是后期突然会一个加速，病人很快进入一种多器官功能衰竭的状态，会是一种炎症的风暴。
But the early onset of some new crown patients is not very dangerous, but a sudden acceleration at a later stage, the patient quickly enters a state of multi-organ failure, which can be a storm of inflammation.
一旦进入这种状态，我们的治疗很难把它拉回来。
Once in this state, it is difficult for our therapy to pull it back.
这和过去完全不一样，很多病人不是死于肺。
Unlike in the past, many patients do not die of lung cancer.
因为我们有ECMO（危重病体外心肺支持），我们有呼吸机，我们有各种治疗的策略，我们可以让病人肺的功能得到代替。
Because we have ECMO, we have a ventilator, we have a variety of treatment strategies, and we can replace the lung function.
但是很多病人死于肺外的多器官功能的衰竭，这个跟过去都有很大的不同。
But many patients die of non-pulmonary multi-organ failure, which is very different from what it used to be.
南方人物周刊：为什么病情会有这种突然的加速？钟鸣：从表面上看，病人的体内可能启动了一种炎症的风暴，这种炎症的风暴导致了各个器官功能的衰竭。
WHY IS SOUTHERN PEOPLE WEEKLY: Why this sudden acceleration? Bell-ringing: On the surface, the patient's body may have started a storm of inflammation that causes organ failure.
我们观察到的是，很多病人都有心肌损伤的标志物的升高，所以这个病毒很有可能它本身也会损伤心肌，类似于心肌炎的表现，可能会损伤很多其他器官。
What we have observed is that many patients have elevated markers of myocardial damage, so the virus is likely to damage the heart muscle itself, similar to myocarditis, which can damage many other organs.
我们收治到的病人，有些人本身就夹杂其他疾病，得了肺炎之后，原有疾病就恶化了。
Some of the patients we admitted were themselves suffering from other diseases, which worsened after pneumonia.
比如我们有个急性心梗过的病人，体内放过支架，他肺炎一来了之后，可能存在着严重的心肌缺血。
For example, we have a patient with an acute myocardial infarction who has been given a stent and may have severe myocardial ischemia following pneumonia.
转到我们这里的，都是在普通病房或者别的医院恶化了，一来都是非常非常的危重。
The ones that have been transferred to us have deteriorated in the general wards or other hospitals, and on the one hand they are very, very dangerous.
南方人物周刊：非常危重意味着什么？钟鸣：随时都会去世。
SOUTHERN PEOPLE WEEKLY: What does it mean to be very critical? Bell-ring: At any moment.
南方人物周刊：危重病人多数是高龄患者么？钟鸣：多数是高龄，或者有很多合并疾病的人。
SOUTHERN PEOPLE WEEKLY: Are the most critically ill people old people? Bell-ming: Most are old people, or people with a lot of common diseases.
我们病房里也有年轻人，二十几岁的也有。
There are young people in our ward, as well as in our twenties.
但目前这些年轻人都还在治疗中，去世的病人中暂时还没有非常年轻的。
But these young people are still in treatment and none of the deceased patients are very young for the time being.
南方人物周刊：体外支持系统最强力的就是ECMO，对于金银潭来说，有多少患者能用到ECMO？钟鸣：金银潭目前ECMO的设备还是比较多的，但就像我刚刚讲的，不是所有危重病人用ECMO就能挽救生命，很多病人死于肺之外的多器官衰竭，这不是ECMO能够替代。
The most powerful external support system is ECMO. How many patients can use ECMO for gold and silver pools? The ECMO equipment is relatively large, but as I just said, not all critically ill people can save lives with ECMO, and many patients die from multiple organ failure outside the lungs, which ECMO cannot replace.
如果病人处于这种状态，ECMO也不能挽救他们的生命。
If patients are in this state, ECMO cannot save their lives.
南方人物周刊：您到武汉一线奋战十天了，现在病人的情况怎么样？钟鸣：经过这十天的流程优化和团队磨合，病区的死亡数量有了明显的减少。
How is the patient nowBell-ringing: After ten days of process optimization and teamwork, there has been a marked decrease in the number of deaths in the affected areas.
比如有一个83岁的老太太进来，当时非常凶险，我们给她吸氧不行，就用呼吸机进行无创的通气。
For example, an 83-year-old woman came in. It was very dangerous. We gave her oxygen. We used a ventilator for noninvasive ventilation.
经过我们去调整她的内环境，去调整呼吸参数，避免了老太太气管插管，最后能过渡到用普通的鼻导管，轻度的吸氧就能够很好，甚至她的核酸都已经转阴了，这两天就要转回到普通病房去。
After we adjusted her internal environment, adjusted her breathing parameters, avoided the old lady's trachea intubation, and finally made the transition to a normal nasal catheter, mildly inhaled oxygen would be fine, even her nucleic acid had turned cloudy, and would be transferred back to the general ward in the next two days.
对我们来说，病人转去普通病房，没有再转回来，就意味着他最终出院了。
For us, the fact that the patient was transferred to the general ward and did not return meant that he was finally discharged from the hospital.
2月2日下午，武汉金银潭医院有37名确诊新型冠状病毒肺炎患者出院，是迄今为止该院出院人数最多的一天南方人物周刊：临时组建的团队，临时改造的病房，这会对工作造成一些困难么？钟鸣：初期会有一些困难。
On the afternoon of February 2, 37 patients with newly diagnosed coronavirus pneumonia were discharged from Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital, the largest number of discharges to date from the hospital.
相比较正规的ICU病房，临时改造的ICU病房非常局促。
Compared to the formal ICU ward, the temporary renovation of the ICU ward is very cramped.
原来放一两个床的空间放了四个床，旁边还放着监护仪、呼吸机、血透机和ECMO。
There were four beds in one or two beds, alongside monitors, a respirator, a hemodialysis machine and an ECMO.
我们的操作非常多，床的一周都要站着医生护士，每个人都顶着墙顶着角，很多事情操作起来都比平时困难。
We had so many operations that we had doctors and nurses standing all week in our beds, each with a wall against his or her horns, and a lot of things were harder than usual.
我们刚开始没有ICU的专业护士，工作极其受制。
We had no ICU professional nurses at first, and the work was extremely stressful.
ICU 的护士专业性要求非常高，她们必须非常熟悉那些重症设备，比如了解监护仪上的生命体征代表什么，了解呼吸机，要能够上血液净化设备，就是我们的双泵血透机等等。
ICU nurses are highly professional, and they must be familiar with critical equipment, such as understanding what vital signs on your monitor represent, understanding the respirator, being able to use a blood purification device, our double pump hemodialysis machine, and so on.
而且她要对病人病情变化具备高度的职业敏感，和医生有很好的配合。
And she needs to have a high degree of professional sensitivity to changes in the patient's condition and to work well with the doctor.
ICU的专业护士短时间是很难替代的，是很紧缺的人才。
ICU professional nurses are hard to replace for a short time, is very short of talent.
现在全国的ICU护士逐渐都调配来支援了，ICU护士和非ICU护士互相配合，一帮一带，磨合得非常好，整个工作流程在规范起来。
Now ICU nurses from all over the country are being deployed, ICU nurses and non-ICU nurses work hand in hand.
我们在这种特殊情况下，做了大量的磨合工作，有些困难你没有经历过，是很难想象到的。
We've done a lot of grind work in this particular situation, and some difficulties you haven't experienced are hard to imagine.
我们制定了很多的规章制度，来让我们的工作尽量能够适应这种特定疫情下的需求。
We have many rules and regulations in place to adapt our work to the needs of this particular epidemic.
比如规定了大家可以交替的事情，不让检查做在同一个时段；还有统一一些病人的管理，减少护士走动的量等等。
For example, it provides for alternating tasks and does not allow examinations to be done at the same time; it also harmonizes the management of some patients, reduces the amount of movement of nurses, etc.
现在大家的信心也恢复了，工作效率也更高了，我们的设备和流程都得到了一步步的完善。
Now everyone's confidence has been restored, efficiency is higher, and our equipment and processes have been improved step by step.
团队已经磨合得高效而团结，工作效率比以前高了非常多。
The team has worn out efficiently and coherently, working much more efficiently than before.
南方人物周刊：你们现在的工作状态是什么样的？钟鸣：医生的白班是从早上7点50交班到晚上5点，护士有夜班有白班，但平均每个都要待六七个小时，所以每个护士出来都像虚脱一样，因为穿了很多的衣服。
What do you do now? Zhong Ming: The doctor's day shift is from 7: 50 am to 5: 00 pm, the nurse has a night shift and a day shift, but the average nurse stays six or seven hours, so every nurse comes out in a state of exhaustion because they wear a lot of clothes.
我们有时候搬病人，要把八九十公斤的人，让他完全翻过来。
We sometimes move patients to turn over eighty or ninety kilograms.
他身上有很多的管子，就需要把病人腾空翻起再放下来。
He had a lot of pipes and needed to be emptied and turned down.
我们戴着面屏，透气都很困难，还要做这种剧烈的体力劳动，都觉得要窒息了。
We wear a face screen, breathable are very difficult, but also to do this kind of intense physical labor, all feel suffocating.
另外做很多事情都非常困难，不是平时状态能够想象的。
Doing a lot of other things is very difficult, not normal state of mind can imagine.
ICU的防护最严格，医护人员戴着面屏，水汽经常糊在眼睛那里，很多时候都看不清。
ICU protection is the most stringent, medical personnel wearing a screen, water vapor often paste in the eyes, many times can not see clearly.
又比如我们上ECMO，我们平时只戴一层手套，但现在要戴三层甚至四层手套，手肿了一样在操作，就会很多困难。
For example, we go to ECMO, we usually only wear a layer of gloves, but now wear three or even four layers of gloves, hand swelling in the operation, will be a lot of difficulties.
在ICU里面待着，对体力和精力要求是非常高的，金银潭的工作远超出我们平时工作的强度。
In the ICU, the physical and mental requirements are very high, gold and silver pool work far beyond our usual intensity of work.
南方人物周刊：您现在有摸索到一些救治危重新冠肺炎病人的规律么？钟鸣：这段时间我也在总结我们收治病人的数据，但是我并没有一个很好的证据、一个科学的东西能够回答你。
Do you know of any rules for treating patients with SARS? Bell-ming: I've been summarizing the numbers of patients we treated, but I don't have a good evidence, a scientific thing to answer you.
现在回答是不负责任的。
It would be irresponsible to answer now.
我们正在寻找规律，但是现在恐怕不能告诉你有什么明确的发现。
We're looking for rules, but I'm afraid we can't tell you anything definite right now.
南方人物周刊：最后一个问题，我们采访到一些轻症或者自愈的病人，大家往往对退烧感到很乐观，这能视为好转的迹象么？钟鸣：并不能掉以轻心。
SOUTHERN PEOPLE'S WEEKLY: Last question, we interviewed people with mild or self-healing illnesses who tend to be optimistic about reducing their fever.
我对轻症病人没有经验，但我们这里的重症病人也有一度好转然后迅速恶化的。
I'm inexperienced with light cases, but our patients with serious illnesses have improved and then deteriorated quickly.
我接触轻症病人的经验不足以给建议，但如果在家隔离，任何症状上的反复或者出现呼吸急促，都应该及时到医院去。
My experience with light cases is not good enough, but if I'm isolated at home, any symptoms of reversals or shortness of breath should go to the hospital in time.
