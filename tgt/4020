复工的日子里，生活习惯已被悄然改变。
In the days of returning to work, habits have been quietly changed.

生活是苦难的。
Life is full of suffering.
。
.
复工第一天，我的自行车被偷了，证明各行各业确实都开始复工了。
The first day I got back to work, my bike was stolen, which proves that all walks of life are indeed back to work.
。
.
复工第二天，我惊喜地接到了骚扰电话，说明人们的精神需求在不断恢复。
The day after I returned to work, I was pleasantly surprised by the harassing phone call, which showed that people's spiritual needs were recovering.
。
.
经历一个超长的假期，不少人重新回到了工作岗位，虽然和一个月前相比还是去一样的地点，做一样的工作，但复工后的工作生活比曾经有了不小的变化。
After an unusually long vacation, many have returned to work, albeit at the same location and in the same jobs as a month ago, but their working lives have changed considerably since they returned to work.
。
.
以前工作日的早上，起床永远都是在闹钟响过了5分钟之后，起来简单洗一把脸，抓上一件衣服就出门了，冲上公交、地铁，正好能够赶上踩点打卡。
On weekday mornings, waking up five minutes after the alarm clock rings, getting up to simply wash your face, grab a piece of clothing, and go out, rushing onto the bus, the subway, just in time to catch the punch card.
。
.
这样简单的日子已经成为了过去，如今上班就如同上战场，出门前先要经过一套严格的整备流程。
Such simple days are behind us. Today, going to work is like going to the battlefield. You have to go through a rigorous preparation process before going out.
。
.
起床第一件事，首先向单位、社区填报当天的身体状态，体温正常身体健康的人才有上班的资格。
Wake up the first thing, first report to the unit, the community on the physical state of the day, body temperature is normal and healthy people have the right to work.
。
.
紧接着要整理装备，佩戴哪种口罩可能会决定一天的状态，医用口罩佩戴舒适但耐久度低，防护能力有限。
The next thing you need to do is to get your gear together. Wearing a mask can determine the state of the day, with a comfortable but low durability and limited protection.
加95%毒抗性的N95口罩防护性能好，但长时间佩戴会很难受。
Plus 95% poison resistant N95 mask provides good protection, but can be painful to wear for long periods of time.
防毒面具兼顾防护能力和舒适性，但羞耻度高。
Gas masks are protective and comfortable, but have a high degree of shame.
当然这只是富人的苦恼，不少人还处于担心口罩不够用的阶段。
Of course, this is the affliction of the rich, and many are still worried about the lack of masks.
。
.
在此基础上也可以添加手套、护目镜、头盔、雨衣等，组成抗疫者套装，能够获得额外的物理防御和病毒抗性。
On this basis can also add gloves, goggles, helmets, raincoats, etc. to form anti-epidemic suits, can obtain additional physical defense and virus resistance.
。
.
除了防护装备，各种辅助道具也不能少了，打火机、一次性手套、牙签、棉签，可以隔绝你不想触碰的污秽之物。
In addition to the protective equipment, a variety of auxiliary props are not missing, lighters, disposable gloves, toothpicks, cotton swab, can isolate you do not want to touch the dirty things.
酒精喷雾和擦片，能造成神圣伤害，使用后还能加一个短暂的精神力提升buff。
Alcohol Spray and Scrub, which do holy damage, add a short mental boost to buff after use.
。
.
把所有的装备都戴上，才有底气出门，虽然这并不能能够保证绝对的安全，但至少让人心里更踏实。
Put on all the equipment to have the courage to go out, although this can not guarantee absolute safety, but at least let people feel more secure.
。
.
一通折腾之后终于准备出门了，第一次踏出小区，就像第一次走出避难所一样，对这个世界充满了陌生和好奇。
After a toss-up finally ready to go out, the first step out of the community, like the first out of the shelter, the world is full of strange and curious.
。
.
首先想到的问题就是，怎么去单位来着？。
The first question that comes to mind is, how to go to work?
这是一个重要的问题，疫情期间处处都要提防传染，而原来的上下班方式可能需要重新评估了。
This is an important issue, and infections must be guarded against everywhere during the epidemic, and the original mode of commuting may need to be reassessed.
。
.
过去的上班方法，是以不迟到为目标，怎么方便怎么来。
The way to go to work in the past was to aim not to be late, how convenient how to get there.
平时主要坐公交，来不及的时候网约车。
Usually the main bus, when it is too late to contract cars.
。
.
但如今不迟到已经不是第一要务，人们最关心的是安全。
But being late is no longer the number one priority, and people are most concerned about security.
公交、地铁会接触密集的人群，成了风险最大的上班方式。
Public transportation, subway will come into contact with the dense crowd, has become the most risky way to work.
。
.
所以人们会尽量错峰出行，要不很早出门，要不就很晚，上车之后也不那么执着于抢座了，只要离其他人远一点，站着好像也是可以忍受的了。
So people will try to stagger the peak travel, or go out early, or very late, after getting on the car is not so persistent to seize seats, as long as you stay away from other people, it seems to be tolerable to stand.
。
.
人们自动保持距离，连眼神交流都没有。
People automatically keep their distance and don't even make eye contact.
不过随着越来越多人开始复工，公交地铁上的人在变得越来越多，距离也越来越近了。
But as more and more people begin to return to work, the number of people on the subway is getting larger and closer.
。
.
打车上班能避开密集的人群，但也并不保险，毕竟车里是两个人带在密闭的小空间，长达几分钟之久。
Taking a taxi to work can avoid the crowds, but it's not safe. After all, it's two people in a small confined space for a few minutes.
。
.
有的司机用塑料布将前排和后排直接建立了隔离带，倒瞬间让人安心不少。
Some drivers use plastic cloth to directly set up the front and back row of the isolation zone, it is a moment of peace of mind.
有些司机全天候开着窗户，让2月的穿堂风一路吹在你脸上，好像是铁了心的要吹出感冒一样。
Some drivers keep their windows open all day long, letting the February storm blow all the way to your face as if they were determined to blow a cold.
。
.
坐在后座的乘客也没有了从前的从容闲适，而是变成了一路的忐忑。
Passengers in the back seat also did not have the leisurely leisure, but into a road of perturbed.
。
.
不论是公交还是打车，都存在安全隐患，因此有的人选择购买私人交通工具，自行车、电瓶车、平衡车的销售开始火爆了起来。
There are safety risks for both public transportation and taxis, so some people choose to buy private transportation. Sales of bicycles, electric vehicles and balanced cars are booming.
。
.
对另一些人来说，共享单车成了救星，每天上班是否迟到完全取决于是路上否能够找到能用的共享单车。
For others, sharing a bike has become a lifesaver, and being late for work each day depends entirely on whether you can find a usable shared bike on the road.
但这也造成了另一个问题，带着口罩骑车可能会缺氧，到单位后，可能是意识模糊的。
But it also creates another problem: Cycling with a mask can be anoxic, and can be confusing when it comes to work.
。
.
2020年拥有一台摩托车是多么重要。
How important it is to have a motorcycle by 2020.
不管选择哪种方式，疫情中的上班路都是辛苦且充满凶险的，但在终点等待着的，并不是安全。
Either way, the way to work in an epidemic is hard and treacherous, but it's not safe to wait at the end.
。
.
到了单位，气氛同样紧张。
At work, the atmosphere is equally tense.
进入大楼就需要经过一层层的哨卡，刚走到大门口几个全副武装的人就围拢上来，有的对着脑门来一测温枪，有的伸手讨要证件，有的监督消毒程序。
Entering the building required passing layers of posts, and just as they reached the gate several heavily armed men gathered, some with a thermostat in front of their heads, some with their hands for documents, some with monitoring disinfection procedures.
。
.
进了办公室，同事们都全副武装的坐在工位上，因为都带着口罩，办公室里的交流少了很多，周围鸦雀无声的，只能听到鼠标和键盘敲击的声音。
When they entered the office, colleagues were sitting in their desks, armed with masks, with much less communication in the office and nothing but mouse and keyboard clicks.
。
.
之前来到单位有人会习惯性的道声早，现在连平时的交流都靠心领神会了，嘴里嗯嗯啊啊，加上手上比划，传递物件都要尽量保持无接触。
Some people used to come to work early, now even the usual communication rely on the understanding of the mouth ah ah, coupled with the hand stroke, to transfer things to keep as much contact as possible.
。
.
公司里的零食区变得很少人光顾，反而是原本冷清的洗手台成了热门景点，万年不用的洗手液成了人气单品。
The snack area in the company has become less frequented, but the original cold hand sanitizer has become a popular spot, 10 million years of use of hand sanitizer has become a popular item.
。
.
从前单位像是员工的第二个家，人们把自己的工位打造得温馨舒适，桌上摆满了植物、手办、摆饰。
Formerly like the second home of the staff, people make their work place warm and comfortable, the table is full of plants, hand, decorations.
。
.
这次回来公司里养的花都萎了，桌上的手办落了一层灰，被各式的洗手液、口罩和消毒剂挡在了后面。
This time back the company's flowers are wilt, the hands on the table run a layer of ash, by all kinds of hand sanitizers, masks and disinfectant blocked in the back.
。
.
因为疫情期间不能开中央空调，同时还要定时通风换气，导致单位的平均温度低于室外，人们把暖宝宝、小太阳拿了出来，自己躲进了羽绒服里。
Because the epidemic period can not turn on the central air conditioning, but also regular ventilation and ventilation, resulting in the unit average temperature lower than the outdoor, people take out the warm baby, the small sun, hide in their own down jacket.
。
.
还有的全天都戴着帽子，一方面是为了保暖，另一方面也怕自己在家DIY失败的发型被同事检阅。
Others wear hats all day long, partly to keep warm, and partly because they're afraid of being censored by colleagues for DIY's failed hairstyle at home.
。
.
好不容易等到到了午休时间，这原本是暂时放下工作的放松身心的好时光，现在却成了每天烦心事。
It's hard to wait until lunchtime, a relaxing time to take a break from work, but now it's a daily chore.
。
.
食堂、外卖都存在一定的隐患，很多人选择了自己带饭。
Canteen, take-out have certain hidden dangers, many people choose to bring their own food.
一到中午公司的微波炉就连续不停的转，之前从来不做饭的同事，个个都变成了大厨，每天晒着盒饭里的新菜式。
At noon the company's microwave oven on a continuous rotation, before never cooking colleagues, everyone has become a chef, every day in the box of rice in the new dishes.
。
.
吃饭就要张嘴，张嘴就要摘口罩，几十个人在一个屋子里张着嘴不戴口罩，几乎是这些人一个月以来经历的最恐怖的事了。
Eating requires opening your mouth and opening your mouth to take off your mask. Dozens of people in one room with their mouths open without wearing masks are almost the scariest thing these people have experienced in a month.
为了防止可能的病毒传播，有的公司支起了隔板，有的食堂架起了考场。
In order to prevent the possible spread of the virus, some companies set up a partition, some canteens set up the test room.
。
.
人们也学会了错峰吃饭，别人吃饭的时候戴上口罩，别人戴上口罩之后自己再吃。
People also learned to eat staggered peak, when others eat wearing masks, others wear masks after their own eating.
还有的地方专门推出了外卖病毒防护罩，让上班的人可以享受一个温馨自闭的私人午休。
There are also places where a special take-out virus shield has been introduced to give working people a warm, shut-in private lunch break.
。
.
虽然现在的午休要消耗花不少的心力，但它仍然有重要的意义。
Although the current lunch break takes a lot of effort, it still has an important meaning.
。
.
对一些人来说，午休是他们唯一能在家以外的地方摘掉口罩的时候，呼吸到原生态的空气，也是一天工作中，最舒爽的时候。
For some, naps are the only time they can take off their masks outside their homes, breathe the pristine air, and be the most comfortable part of the day.
然而这种舒爽只会持续大概几秒钟，然后就会被随之而来的恐惧所取代。
However, this comfort lasts only a few seconds and is replaced by the fear that comes with it.
不戴口罩吃饭，就像不系安全绳攀岩一样，暗爽中带着惊险。
Eating without a mask is like climbing without a safety rope, a thrill in the dark.
。
.
所以很多人在吃饭时并没有心情细细品味，也来不及赞叹自己的厨艺，只是一股脑的把饭菜扒进嘴里，戴上口罩再慢慢咀嚼。
So many people do not eat in the mood to savor, too late to praise their cooking skills, just pickled the food into the mouth, put on a mask before chewing slowly.
。
.
经过了一天的自闭工作，终于熬到了下班的时间，人们开始逃向家里。
After a day of shut-in work, people began to flee to their homes when it was time to leave work.
。
.
从前即使到了下班时间有些人还是会在座位上多待一会，如今人们的下班要干脆了许多，并不想在单位多待一分钟，能早走绝不加班。
In the past, some people stayed in their seats a little longer even when it was time to get off work. Now people have to work a lot more and don't want to spend an extra minute at work.
尤其在戴了一天口罩之后，大脑也感觉严重缺氧，酸疼的鼻子和耳朵在严重的抗议。
Especially after a day of wearing a mask, the brain also feels severely hypoxic, sore nose and ears in severe protest.
。
.
但回家也没有那么容易，首先又要经历一次通勤，而下班的人群可能比上班还要集中。
But going home isn't that easy. First, there's a commute, and the crowds may be even more concentrated than at work.
。
.
同时为了使这次下班变得更有意义，回家的路线还要进行周密的计划。
At the same time, in order to make this work more meaningful, the home route will have to be carefully planned.
如果晚上要吃外卖，就要在回家之前先叫好，与外面同时到达小区门口，否则就得站在门口等外卖了。
If you want to eat take-out at night, you have to shout before you go home, get to the gate of the neighborhood at the same time, or stand at the door and wait for the takeaway.
。
.
这种架子成为了各种小区的标配。
This shelf serves as a standard for all sorts of small areas.
哪怕家里暂时不需要，也要顺道路过一些店铺去买点蔬菜、水果、零食什么的，好不容易出了一次门，如果空手而归未免太可惜了。
Even if you don't need it at home, you should stop by some shops to buy some vegetables, fruit, snacks and so on. It would be a pity to return empty-handed.
如果有快递可以顺道拿回去，那实在是莫大的幸福。
If there is express delivery can be taken back by the way, it is really a great happiness.
。
.
满载而归回到家里后，还不能立刻休息，首先要对手机、钥匙等装备进行消毒，然后把衣服、口罩妥善安置，喷洒消毒液，开窗通风，沐浴更衣，接着开始准备晚饭和第二天的午饭。
After returning home from a full load, they could not immediately rest. They had to disinfect their mobile phones and keys, properly place their clothes and masks, spray disinfectant, open windows, bathe in clothes, and then prepare dinner and lunch the next day.
。
.
一套流程下来，等到吃完了饭，时间也不早了。
A set of procedures down, until the end of the meal, the time is not too late.
拖着疲惫的身体躺在床上，大脑中一片空白。
Drag tired body lying in bed, a blank in the brain.
。
.
最后刷着手机，幻想着一切结束的样子，进入梦乡。
Finally brush the mobile phone, fantasize about the end of all the way to sleep.
。
.
疫情中的每一天都是艰苦的，离开了家的人们时刻都是忐忑的。
Every day of the epidemic is hard, people who left their homes are perturbed.
。
.
然而生活还是要继续，复工的人们还是要每天穿戴整齐，迎接新的太阳。
However, life still has to continue, return to work people still have to dress neatly every day, to meet the new sun.
。
.
疫情中，每个人都在用自己的方式作着斗争，我们也逐渐习惯了脸上的口罩和心中的不安。
In the epidemic, everyone is fighting in their own way, and we are getting used to the face masks and inner uneasiness.
。
.
人们对痛苦一点点的麻木了，反而更容易发现，周围的一些小快乐、小感动。
People are a little bit numb to the pain, on the contrary, it is easier to find around some small happy, moved.
这种幸福也许不是确实的，在一个月前可能根本算不上快乐，但如今却是我们每天坚持下去的力量。
This happiness may not be true, it may not have been happiness at all a month ago, but it is the strength we carry on every day.
。
.
当痛苦变成了一种常态，我们学会了在痛苦中作乐，也才明白当初的平淡生活是多么的幸福和可贵。
When pain becomes a normal state, we learn to play in pain, but also understand the original plain life is how happy and valuable.
。
.
而我们现在承受的一切，也只是为了找回那份平淡而已。
And what we are suffering now is just to get back that insipid share.
。
.
