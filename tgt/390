此时，距离他确诊为感染新型冠状病毒，只过去了不到一周时间。
At this point, he was diagnosed as infected with a new coronavirus, only less than a week passed.
武汉市卫健委7日凌晨发布公告，向李文亮医生表示沉痛哀悼并向其家属表示深切慰问！深一度记者在2月7日零时零五分时，从一名微博认证为武汉市中心医院急诊科护士的@李梦萍Camille处获悉，李文亮仍在通过人工肺（ECMO）进行抢救，抢救于当晚9时许开始。
At 0005 hours on February 7, a reporter from Weibo certified Li Mengping Camille, an emergency nurse at Wuhan Central Hospital, was told that Li Wenliang was still being rescued by artificial lung (ECMO).

On the same day, he refused to continue to give other media interviews, "a little tired, I want to get well first."
李文亮认为，肥胖或许是导致他恢复缓慢的原因。
He said obesity may have contributed to his slow recovery.

Li Wenliang has a severe fever, often 39.6 degrees and 39.7 degrees, is useless with injections and has difficulty breathing, said a nurse who attended Li Wenliang earlier in a media interview.

"In serious cases, his face was painfully breathless and cyanotic, and I put on a mask and sucked in oxygen.
”在接下来几天，李文亮的病情一直反复。
Over the next few days, Li Wenliang's illness continued to recur.

At the doctor's direction, she used Zoc, levofloxacin, ribavirin, oseltamivir, and gamma globulin to boost immunity.

Li told reporters that the immunoglobulin used in the treatment had been sent out at his own expense for 600 yuan a bottle and 8 bottles a day.
李文亮的朋友圈设置为“仅三天可见”。

He loves food, he's had a lot of sun in his friends' circles, he hasn't had much of a circle of friends since he fell ill, and now there's only one line and 13 cold words left in his circle of friends.

”李文亮从未去过华南海鲜市场，他认为自己被感染是因为接诊了一名疑似病人。
Mr. Li, who has never been to the South China seafood market, believes he was infected because he admitted a suspected patient.
“1月7、8号的时候，我接诊了一名急性青光眼的病人，她住院的第二天开始发热。

肺部CT检测出来是肺部磨玻璃样病变，符合新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎表现。
Pulmonary CT was detected to be a glassy lung lesion, consistent with the new coronavirus infection pneumonia.
” 在病人出现发热症状后，医生开始被要求佩戴N95口罩，而在此前病人尚未发烧时，医生们并未戴口罩。
Doctors began being asked to wear N95 masks after patients developed fever, and had not worn them before the onset of fever.
李文亮曾两次做核酸检测，第二次为阴性，直到2月1日，他告诉深一度记者，前一天所做的第三次核酸检测结果为阳性，至此，方才确诊感染新冠肺炎。
He tested twice for nucleic acid, the second time negative, until Feb. 1, when he told a deep-rooted reporter that he had tested positive for his third nucleic acid the day before he was diagnosed with New Crown Pneumonia.
2月2日下午，在与纪录片导演赵琦的交流中，李文亮表示自己呼吸仍困难，肺功能恢复比较慢，医生估计还要住院两周。
In a conversation with documentary director Zhao Qi on the afternoon of February 2, Li said he was still having difficulty breathing, his lungs were recovering slowly and doctors were expecting him to stay in hospital for another two weeks.
李文亮考虑过，等身体康复之后，自己还要继续上一线参与救治工作，“现在疫情还在扩散，不想当逃兵”，“大家都不去，怎么办？”李文亮父母在他出现症状后两天被感染，出现发热、呕吐的症状，肺部CT同样呈现磨玻璃样病变。
"Now the epidemic is spreading and we don't want to become deserters," Li said, adding that his parents had been infected with fever and vomiting for two days after he developed symptoms.
“他们是1月15、16号左右住院治疗的，当时床位已经很紧张了。
"They were hospitalized around January 15 and 16, when the beds were already tight.
”目前，李文亮父母已治愈出院。
Li's parents have been cured and discharged.
李文亮同妻子自1月11日起便未见过面，怀有身孕的妻子目前在外地娘家。
Li and his wife, who have not met since January 11, are now with their pregnant wife.
李文亮此前接受深一度记者采访时表示，“我每天都和老婆视频聊天，她每天都在鼓励我，让我积极治疗，她和儿子都在等着我。
"I chat with my wife every day. She encourages me every day and gives me positive treatment. She and her son are waiting for me," Li said in an interview with reporters.
我目前呼吸困难，说话不太方便，一般都是她说我听。
I'm having trouble breathing and I'm having trouble speaking. She's usually the one who says I'm listening.
”李文亮医生在几天前还表示，身体恢复后就上一线有人因他而“避过一劫”2月6日晚上，媒体发布李文亮去世之后，另一则消息传来，称李文亮正在接受ECMO抢救，李文亮曾经就读学校的校友会同学们也纷纷互相咨询消息。
"Dr Li also said a few days ago, after his recovery on the front line of people because of his" escape "the evening of February 6, the media announced that Lee Wenliang is receiving ECMO rescue, Li Wenliang has been attending the school alumni groups have been consulting each other.
7日0点38分，武汉中心医院官微发布消息，李文亮医生“目前病危，正在全力抢救中”。
7 0: 38, Wuhan Central Hospital, the official micro-release of information, Dr. Lee Wenliang "is critically ill, is in full rescue."
让李文亮走进人们视线的是一张2019年12月30日的聊天记录截图：他在大学同学群内称，“华南水果海鲜市场确诊了7例SARS，在我们医院急诊科隔离”。
What drew Li Wenliang into view was a chat recorded on Dec. 30, 2019: "The South China fruit and seafood market confirmed seven cases of SARS, isolated in our hospital emergency department," he said in a group of university students.
此后，他在派出所签署了一份《训诫书》。
Thereafter, he signed a reprimand at the police station.
李文亮认为，那张被广泛传播的截图的确存在断章取义，“当时在群里一开始说了‘确诊7例SARS’，不太准确，后来我又强调是冠状病毒，具体还在分型。
Li said the widely circulated screenshot was indeed taken out of context. "At the beginning of the group, we said 'seven cases of SARS diagnosed', which is not accurate.
”1月28日，最高人民法院微信公众号发布文章称，“尽管新型肺炎并不是SARS，但信息发布者发布的内容，并非完全捏造，但如果社会公众听信了这个‘谣言’，并基于对SARS的恐慌而采取了佩戴口罩、严格消毒、避免再去野生动物市场等措施，这对我们今天更好地防控新型肺炎，可能是一件幸事。
"Although the new pneumonia is not SARS, the information publisher's announcement is not a complete fabrication, but if the public listens to this' rumour 'and adopts measures such as wearing masks, strictly disinfecting and avoiding the wildlife market based on panic over SARS, it may be a blessing to us today to better control new forms of pneumonia.
”家人都在武汉的张江便自称是因李文亮的“预警”而获益的人。
Family members in Wuhan's Zhang Jiang said they were benefiting from Li's "warning".
“我个人万分感谢他，让我一月初就开始让家人朋友戴口罩。
"I personally thank him so much that I started wearing masks on my family and friends in early January.
”带有上述内容的截图在1月1日传到了张江的高中群，“我是经历过非典的人”。
The screenshot, with the content, spread to high school students in Zhangjiang on January 1. "I am someone who has experienced SARS."
2003年非典时期，张江正在北京读大学，他的大学班主任和他的妻子先后确诊非典离世，留下一个女儿。
During the SARS period in 2003, Zhang Jiang was studying at a university in Beijing. His university head teacher and his wife diagnosed SARS dead, leaving a daughter behind.
当天，张江在网上下单，给家人购买了300个一次性口罩和3个防毒面罩。
Zhang Jiang ordered 300 disposable masks and three gas masks for his family on the same day.
家人不信，张江就每天劝说、提醒。
Family members do not believe, Zhang Jiang every day to persuade, remind.
现在张江因工作停留在上海，家人在武汉不能下楼。
Now that Zhang Jiang is working in Shanghai, his family cannot go downstairs in Wuhan.
张江称，一家人“避免了这一劫”。
The family "avoided the hijacking," Zhang said.
34岁的李文亮喜欢明星肖战、《庆余年》和动漫，爱发微博。
34-year-old Li Wenliang likes star Xiao Zhan, "Yu-Yue" and animation, love Weibo.
去年生日那天，李文亮在微博里写道，“今天又是忙碌的一天，患者多了心情难免有些急躁，感谢每个患者对我的体谅……”新的一岁，他希望“能做一个简单的人，看得清世间繁杂却不在心中留下痕迹，保持足够的平常心。
On his birthday last year, Li Wenliang wrote in Weibo: "Today is another busy day and the patient is not free from impatience. Thanks to every patient's consideration for me..." The new year-old hopes to be "a simple man who can see the complexities of the world without leaving traces in his heart and maintain enough normality."
