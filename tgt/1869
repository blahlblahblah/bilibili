面对战“疫”，一个人的力量或许有限但一群人的力量，却足以越过寒冬2月16号，张春田将一批负压救护车运抵武汉。
Facing the plague, one's strength may be limited, but the strength of a group of people, but over the cold winter February 16, Zhang Chuntian a batch of negative pressure ambulances arrived in Wuhan.
此前，受疫情影响，高速公路服务区暂停餐饮服务，他和司机兄弟们只能靠泡面、干粮果腹。
Previously, affected by the epidemic, highway service areas suspended catering services, he and his brothers can only rely on bubble noodles, dried grains.
“我肯定得去，你们谁也拦不住我。
I must go, no one of you can stop me.
”成为美的运输车队志愿者之前，家人对他前往疫区强烈反对。
Before becoming a volunteer for the US transport convoy, his family strongly objected to his travel to the affected areas.
但张春田知道，这批负压救护车是救命的东西。
But Zhang Chuntian knows that these negative pressure ambulances are life-saving things.
区别于普通救护车，负压救护车最大的特点就是能使外界与车内环境免受污染，最大限度减少车内医护人员以及车外人员的交叉感染风险，主要用于重大传染病员的安全隔离与转运。
Unlike ordinary ambulances, the biggest feature of negative pressure ambulances is to avoid pollution outside and inside the vehicle environment, minimize the risk of cross-infection of medical staff and people outside the vehicle, mainly for the safety of the major infectious disease isolation and transshipment.
1月24日，湖北13市封城，全省医疗物资面临巨大缺口。
January 24, Hubei 13 closed city, the province faces a huge gap in medical supplies.
在疫情处于爬坡的关键阶段，整个社会的应急储备迎来大考。
In the critical phase of the epidemic is climbing, the whole community's emergency reserve ushered in a major test.
一群“逆行者”正在通过自身力量，努力钻木生火，用温暖的光照亮那片土地。
Through their own efforts, a group of "Inverters" are trying to make a fire out of wood and illuminate the land with warm light.
15天加速生产，2000公里爱心接力1月26日，美的集团抗“疫”物资采购组接到一份特殊的任务，采购140辆负压救护车捐献给湖北疫区。
15 days of accelerated production, 2000 kilometers of love relay January 26, the United States group anti-epidemic material procurement team received a special mission to purchase 140 negative pressure ambulances donated to Hubei epidemic areas.
这对于并非经营汽车的美的而言，难度不言而喻。
This is not operating the United States car, the difficulty is self-evident.
就在当天，一个包含美的集团高层、财务、法务、税务等在内的“战疫突击队”迅速组建。
On the same day, a "plague commando" was quickly formed, which included top officials of the United States Group, finance, legal affairs, taxation, etc.
36个小时内打了上百通电话，最终在1月28日早上锁定12家车企。
Hundreds of calls were made within 36 hours, culminating in the targeting of 12 car companies on the morning of 28 January.
但由于负压救护车需要定制化生产，车企普遍交付时间都在3月份。
But since negative-pressure ambulances need to be custom-made, car companies generally deliver in March.
“早一分钟到达，就能早一分钟救人”，美的团队展开与车企锲而不舍的沟通，最终在工信部等政府部门的大力支持下，将首批交付时间敲定在2月10日。
"One minute early, one minute early to save lives." The US team began unswerving communication with the car companies, and with strong support from government departments such as the Ministry of Industry and Communications, the first delivery date was set for February 10.
1月29日晚，第一批订单签妥。
On the evening of 29 January, the first orders were signed.
虽然正值春节假期，但从1月28日洽谈需求再到向车企火速付款、确认订单，仅用了24小时。
Although it was the Spring Festival holiday, it took only 24 hours to negotiate demand on January 28th and to make quick payments to car companies to confirm orders.
订单确认，但新一轮的阻碍似乎刚刚开始。
Orders are confirmed, but a new round of blockages seems to be just beginning.
疫情期间，工厂面临负压设备等核心部件紧缺和缺少工人两大难题。
During the epidemic, factories faced shortages of core components such as negative pressure equipment and a shortage of workers.
面对“近乎不可能的任务”，一场通力协作的接力赛随之打响。
Faced with a "near impossible task," a concerted relay race began.
美的随即请求工信部支持，指定供应商提供组装负压救护车所需底盘等配件，并调配负压隔离系统、负压隔离舱等设备，联动各方帮助车企同步解决，压缩生产时间。
Mei immediately requested the support of the Ministry of Industry and Communications to appoint a supplier to supply spare parts such as chassis for assembling a negative pressure ambulance, and to deploy equipment such as a negative pressure isolation system and a negative pressure isolation module.
在华晨雷诺位于沈阳的工厂内，自发放弃休假的工人们冒着零下15度的严寒，在户外停车场调车、运车，以尽快把车辆运送到车间内进行改造。
At Huachen Renault's Shenyang factory, workers who gave up their vacations spontaneously moved in and out of the parking lot, braving 15 degrees below zero, to transport the vehicles to the workshop for modification as soon as possible.
在各方努力下，最终将30天的改造工期压缩到15天以内。
Thanks to the efforts of the parties, the 30-day renovation period was finally reduced to less than 15 days.
经过努力，在沈阳生产的第5批40辆负压救护车赶制完成，但要穿越2000公里抵达湖北，无疑给这批预定16日交付带来巨大挑战。
The completion of the fifth batch of 40 negative pressure ambulances in Shenyang, but its 2,000-kilometer journey to Hubei undoubtedly posed a huge challenge to the scheduled delivery of 16 days.
辽宁长久运输接过了这支接力棒，而负责这批车辆运输的13名司机，全部由志愿者组成，张春田就是其中的一员。
Zhang Chuntian was one of 13 drivers in charge of transporting the 13 drivers, all of whom were volunteers, who took the baton from Liaoning Province.
“路很滑，货车不能随便变道，交警就在前面疏通其它车辆。
"The road was slippery and the lorries couldn't change lanes easily. Traffic police were trying to clear the other cars ahead.
”张春田回忆。
"recalls Zhang Chuntian.
彼时，一场大范围风雪侵袭我国南北方，运输队正途经天津，大雪致使高速封闭，寸步难行。
At that time, a large-scale snowstorm hit China's north and south, the convoy is passing through Tianjin, snow caused high-speed closure, impossible.
美的立即联系工信部和包括湖北交通厅在内的各地交通厅寻求支援。
Mei immediately contacted the Ministry of Industry and Communications and other transportation departments including Hubei Transport Department for support.
1小时后，天津高速公路交警大队赶到，将车队护送至河北。
An hour later, Tianjin expressway traffic police brigade arrived, escort the convoy to Hebei.
随后，河北、河南、湖北交警继续接力，直至车队安全抵达武汉。
Subsequently, Hebei, Henan and Hubei traffic police continued to relay until the convoy safely arrived in Wuhan.
天津、河南的交警还为司机们准备了热腾腾的饭菜，这让在途中不得不用泡面充饥的张春田感动。
Traffic police in Tianjin and Henan also prepared hot meals for drivers, which moved Zhang Chuntian, who had to stay his hunger on the way.
面对交警的致敬，张春田有些不好意思，“因为咱们是司机，往这边送些物资和正常工作是一样的，只是去的地方不同了。
"Zhang Chuntian was embarrassed by the homage of the traffic police." Because we are drivers, it is the same thing to send goods here as normal work, only to go to different places.
听他说完，感觉像是做了好人好事似的。
It felt as if he had done a good deed to hear him finish.
”目前，最后一批从无锡出发的18台负压救护车，已于2月20日凌晨4时许到达武汉大花岭火车站。
The last batch of 18 negative pressure ambulances from Wuxi arrived at Wuhan Dahua Ridge railway station at about 4 a.m. on February 20.
至此，美的采购捐赠的140辆负压救护车已全部到位，投入战“疫”一线。
So far, the United States procurement donated 140 negative pressure ambulances have been fully in place, into the "epidemic" line.
而在湖北省内，另一场接力赛仍在上演。
In Hubei province, another relay race is still going on.
挨过寒冷冬夜，一脚油门继续向前“我不累，他们才是最危险，最累的人啊，战胜疫情还得靠他们，我只是做一点力所能及的事情。
I'm not tired, they're the most dangerous and tired people. It's up to them to overcome the epidemic. I'm just doing what I can.
”桑师傅看着坐在医院走廊里打盹的医生和护士，很是心疼。
"Master Sang looked at the doctors and nurses nodding in the hallway of the hospital and was very sad.
此时，他刚刚把一批物资送到鄂州雷神山医院。
At this time, he just sent a batch of materials to the Huizhou Luishen Mountain Hospital.
1月26日晚，在距离武汉400公里的湖北随州，桑师傅接到一个电话，问他是否愿意参与武汉救援物资的配送，他毫不犹豫地答应了。
On the night of January 26, in Suizhou, Hubei Province, 400 kilometers from Wuhan, Master Sang received a telephone call asking him if he would like to participate in the distribution of relief materials, he did not hesitate to agree.
彼时，是武汉封城的第三天，在武汉有完备仓储物流系统的美的集团，捐赠大批物资到火神山、雷神山及湖北各县市医院。
At that time, it was the third day of Wuhan, in Wuhan, a complete warehouse logistics system of the United States Group, donated large amounts of materials to the god of fire, Lei Shenshan and Hubei county hospitals.
而承担救援物资点对点派送任务的是美的旗下安得智联物流公司，桑师傅是其中的一位司机。
The point-to-point delivery of relief supplies is undertaken by the United States of America's Ahn Ji-lian logistics company, of which Shifu is one of the drivers.
1月27日，从随州赶到武汉的桑师傅准时出现在了公司仓库门口，此时的他没有想到，平时再熟悉不过的工作，正面临重重挑战。
January 27, from Suizhou to Wuhan on time appeared in the company warehouse at the door, he did not think, usually familiar with the work, is facing many challenges.
早上7点，桑师傅开工，将一批物资送到鄂州雷神山医院。
At 7 a.m., Master Sang began to work and sent a batch of materials to the Luishen Mountain Hospital in Huizhou Province.
但连续阴雨天气，让前往鄂州的路变得十分泥泞，货车时刻面临陷入泥淖的风险。
But continuous rainy weather made the road to Huizhou very muddy, and the lorry was always at risk of becoming mired in mud.
一旦陷入，就需要调配工地上的挖掘机帮忙推车，桑师傅也总是弄得手脚都是泥。
Once trapped, the need to deploy excavators on the site to help the trolley, master Sang is always hands and feet muddy.
每天送完最后一单，通常都是深夜。
The last order is delivered every day, usually late at night.
考虑到自己经常进出医院，桑师傅并不敢回家，担心给身边的人造成交叉感染的他，就在车里准备一条棉被，每晚就在车里休息，一睁眼，便继续投入工作。
Considering how often he went to the hospital, he was afraid to go home, worried about cross-infection, so he prepared a quilt in his car and rested in the car every night.
挨过每个寒冷冬夜的桑师傅，也会时常想念为他日夜担忧的家人，但他选择在封城后的武汉开车前行，是因为有更多想保护的人。
Every cold winter night Master Sang will often miss his family, who worry about him day and night, but he chose to drive in Wuhan after the closure because there are more people who want to protect.
在安得智联像桑师傅这样的司机师傅还有很多，他们将跑完湖北70多家定点医院，将救援物资亲手派送到医生手中。
There are still many drivers in Andhizhilian, such as Master Sang, who will run through more than 70 designated hospitals in Hubei Province and hand-deliver relief supplies to doctors.
“逆行者”一路同行疫情当前，无人能置身事外。
"Reverse walker" all the way along the epidemic, no one can stay out of the current situation.
驰援武汉，驰援湖北，在唤起了中国企业的社会责任感的同时，也让企业集体面临一次责任大考。
Fly up Wuhan, help Hubei, in evoke the social responsibility of Chinese enterprises, but also let enterprises collectively face a big test of responsibility.
有人说，这是自2008年汶川地震后的第二次大考。
Some said it was the second big test since the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008.
不一样的是，12年后，中国企业履责已经提升到了新的阶段，全社会对公益评价也更为理性。
In contrast, after 12 years, Chinese enterprises have reached a new stage of responsibility, and the whole society is more rational in its evaluation of public welfare.
人们意识到，捐款数额并不是唯一重要的事情，而企业如何基于疫区需求发挥自己优势资源和专业能力，实现救援效果最大化，才是被定义为最好的援助。
It is recognized that the amount of donations is not the only thing that matters, and how an enterprise can maximize its resources and expertise based on the needs of the affected areas to maximize the effectiveness of the assistance is defined as the best assistance.
值得一提的是，此次疫情处于春节特殊节点，加上封城、居家隔离等举措，给企业增加了援助难度，但拥有强大调配资源的企业便有了快速行动的能力。
Worth mentioning is that the epidemic in the Spring Festival special node, plus the closure of the city, home isolation and other measures to increase the difficulty of business assistance, but a strong deployment of resources enterprises have the ability to act quickly.
一直以来，全球化被定义为美的链接未来的主航道，现如今，美的集团43%的经营收入来自于海外市场，这些经年累积的海外资源，为此次前线物资的“拾遗补缺”提供有力基础。
Globalization has long been defined as the future main waterway of the United States. Today, 43% of the Group's operating income comes from overseas markets.
面对湖北前线物资缺口，美的在第一时间利用全球产品、渠道、资源、团队优势，用“美的速度”为前线及时送上最有用的帮助：1月24日开始，向武汉火神山医院、雷神山医院捐赠所需家电产品，26日，首批产品运抵火神山医院建设现场，并向湖北疫区捐赠1亿元人民币，用于抗“疫”物资全球采购，一周内全球“海淘”到300万只医用口罩、近4万双一次性医用手套，首批52.5万只韩国医用口罩于1月31日抵达武汉……于任何企业而言，社会责任路线都会随着企业自身定位和外界对其角色的认知变化而不断调整。
Since January 24, the first batch of products have arrived at Wuhan Huangshen Mountain Hospital. The first batch of products have arrived at Wuhan Huangshen Mountain Hospital on January 26. The first batch of products arrived in Wuhan on January 31.
对于营收在2600亿元以上的美的而言，持续调整和创新产品与业务，是企业发展的一种常态，这种思路亦被融于公益之中。
For the United States with more than 260 billion yuan in revenue, continuous adjustment and innovation of products and businesses is the norm in the development of enterprises, and this thinking is also integrated into the common good.
就像美的用捐赠负压救护车，这么“一件不擅长的事”证明，他们在履行社会责任的过程中是专业的，高效的，创新的。
Just as beauty uses a donated negative-pressure ambulance, such a "bad thing" proves that they are professional, efficient, and innovative in carrying out their social responsibilities.
这源于美的多年来的履责经验。
This stems from years of experience with beauty.
和很多伟大的企业将社会责任融入企业战略一样，美的也一直在探索构建可持续的社会责任发展体系。
Like many great companies that have incorporated social responsibility into their corporate strategies, America has been exploring ways to build a sustainable social responsibility development system.
过去20年，美的创始人何享健和美的集团在扶贫、救灾、养老、教育等慈善领域投入超过70亿元，发起和践行多个社会责任项目，不仅帮助到需要帮助的人，也锻炼了自身“作战”能力。
Over the past 20 years, the founding fathers of the United States, Ho Kin-mei Group, have invested more than 7 billion yuan in charity work in poverty alleviation, disaster relief, old age and education.
美的深知，面对战“疫”，一个人的力量或许有限，但一群人的力量，却足以越过寒冬。
Beauty knows that one may be limited in the face of the plague, but the strength of a group of people is enough to overcome the cold winter.
在救援中，美的联动政府、相关车企、物流系统等多方，争分夺秒保证每个环节不掉链子，不仅体现了中国民企的责任担当，也充分展现了发展壮大起来的中国民企的行动力和号召力。
In the rescue, the United States, the United States Government, relevant automobile enterprises, logistics system, and so on, to ensure that each link does not lose the chain, not only reflects the responsibility of Chinese private enterprises, but also fully demonstrates the growing strength and appeal of Chinese private enterprises.
不断变化的外部环境，给所有企业带来如何打破自我习惯的压力。
The changing external environment puts pressure on all businesses to break their habits.
50余年来，领导力、应变力、快速行动力成为了美的不断寻求变革的关键。
For more than 50 years, leadership, resourcefulness, and rapid action have been the keys to America's relentless quest for change.
在这次战“疫”中，美的秉持这种理念，作为“逆行者”中的一员冲在最前方。
In this "plague" of the war, the United States uphold this idea, as one of the "Reverse" in the forefront.
这一路上，也因为有了更多同行者，让我们离那个心之向往的目标更进一步。
Along the way, also because there are more fellow travelers, let us away from that heart's longing for the goal.
