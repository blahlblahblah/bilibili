作者 | 金玙璠 苏琦 唐亚华编辑 | 魏佳国内疫情流行高峰已经过去，国外的疫情开始爆发。
The peak of the epidemic in Wei Jia is over, and outbreaks abroad have begun.
世界卫生组织3月11日晚将新冠疫情调整为“全球大流行”级别。
The World Health Organization on the night of March 11 adjusted the new crown epidemic to a "global pandemic" level.
事实上，早在2月26日，国外的新增病例就已经超过国内。
Indeed, as early as February 26, the number of new cases abroad surpassed that in China.
截至北京时间3月13日7时，国外患者已累计确诊53428人，单日新增六千人以上。
As of 0700 hours Beijing time on March 13, 2005, foreign patients had confirmed 53,428 cases, adding more than 6,000 people a day.
受疫情等因素影响，昨夜今晨全球金融市场再次开启暴跌模式，超过10国股市发生熔断。
Influenced by the epidemic and other factors, financial markets around the world began to plunge again last night, with more than 10 stock markets melting.
美国股市至今共三次熔断，两次发生在本周。
The U. S. stock market has seen three meltdowns so far, two this week.
最终美股全线收跌超9%，标普500指数与道指均创下1987年“黑色星期一”以来最大单日跌幅。
In the end, U.S. stocks fell more than 9% across the board, with both the S & P 500 and the Dow dropping their biggest one-day declines since Black Monday in 1987.
受大盘影响，明星中概股全线下跌，其中阿里巴巴跌6.94%，京东跌7.87%，拼多多跌6.42%，网易跌7.88%，百度跌8.55%，携程跌5.95%，荔枝、蘑菇街跌幅近30%。
Among them, Alibaba fell 6.94 percent, Jingdong dropped 7.87 percent, Netease fell 6.42 percent, Netease was down 7.88 percent, Baidu was down 8.55 percent, Ctrip was down 5.95 percent, and lychee and mushroom streets were down nearly 30 percent.
疫情对全球经济的影响也逐渐由需求端蔓延至供给端。
The epidemic's impact on the global economy is also spreading from the demand side to the supply side.
中国，以及美国、日本、韩国、德国、意大利、西班牙、伊朗等疫情严重的国家，多为重要的出口国。
China, as well as the United States, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Germany, Italy, Spain, Iran and other serious epidemic countries, most of which are important exporters.
这意味着，疫情的影响，从国内前期对旅游、娱乐、餐饮等行业的消费抑制，开始渗透到生产环节冲击产业链，中国对外依存度高的行业压力陡升。
This means that the impact of the epidemic, from the domestic pre-consumption of tourism, entertainment, catering and other industries, began to infiltrate the production chain into the industrial chain, China's high dependence on the industry pressure has risen steeply.
有投资人判断，疫情全球性蔓延首先影响出口，紧跟着是出海企业，接下来会传导到整个互联网行业。
Some investors judged that the global spread of the epidemic first affected exports, followed by enterprises at sea, and then to the entire Internet industry.
旅游人盼望的报复性消费还没见到曙光，全球业务警报已经拉响；手机厂商今年以来都重仓押注5G换机潮，但离开海外供应链后果难以预估；跨境电商供应链、物流运力、复工节奏都再次被打乱；出海企业是几家欢喜几家愁；疫情下地球村民都隔离在家，冲击线下业态的同时也给线上产品和服务带来了流量红利。
The prospect of retaliatory spending has not yet dawned, global business alerts are ringing; mobile phone makers are betting this year on 5G swaps, but the consequences of leaving overseas supply chains are difficult to predict; cross-border business supply chains, logistics capacity, and back-to-work rhythm are again disrupted.
全球疫情之下，哪些中国科技企业最受冲击？燃财经采访了6位投资人、7家企业、1名行业人士，分别围绕旅游、手机、跨境电商、出海、在线娱乐、医疗健康、游戏等领域做出初步预判，并给出建议。
In the face of the global epidemic, which Chinese technology companies have been the hardest hit? Six investors, seven companies and one trade official were interviewed and given preliminary advice on tourism, mobile phones, cross-border e-commerce, maritime transport, online entertainment, health care, games, etc.
多位受访者担心的是疫情持续时间，如果一到两个月左右，行业勉强可以承受，但是如果持续下去，带来的影响将不可估量。
Many respondents were worried about the duration of the epidemic, which the industry could barely sustain if it lasted for a month or two, but if it continued, the impact would be immeasurable.
旅游行业再持续3-4月，很多企业是扛不住的疫情正在削弱全球旅游行业。
The tourism industry will continue for another three to four months, and the global tourism industry is being weakened by the unbearable disease of many businesses.
根据UNWTO（联合国世界旅游组织)的数据，全球出境游2018年的市场规模是14500亿美元，其中中国游客在国外消费超过2770亿美元，接近全球出境游总花费的1/5。
According to the World Tourism Organization, the global market for outbound travel in 2018 was $1,450 billion, with Chinese tourists spending more than $277bn abroad, nearly a fifth of the total outbound outbound travel.
全球旅游业正因为中国游客的减少“陷入窘境”，而国内旅游服务商也在遭受空前的打击。
Global tourism is "in a quandary" as fewer Chinese tourists arrive, and domestic travel service providers are being hit harder than ever.
“就在三五天前，行业内企业还认为旅游行业就要见到曙光了，再坚持一段时间，起码国内小范围还是能流动的，再过一段可能出境也能逐渐恢复。
"Just three or five days ago, companies in the industry thought the travel industry was going to see the light of day, and to stay there for a while, at least in a small part of the country, and to recover after a while.
现在看来都不成立了。
It doesn't seem to work anymore.
”劲旅网创始人魏长仁判断，美国、欧洲等主要旅游目的地的疫情，在一两个月内恐怕难以结束，市场可能要等几个月甚至半年到一年以后再打开。
Wei Changren, founder of Jinlu Group, reckons that outbreaks in major tourist destinations such as the US and Europe will be difficult to end in a month or two and markets may wait months or even six months to a year before opening up.
短短几天，旅游行业开始寄希望于国内了。
In a matter of days, the travel industry is starting to look to home.
魏长仁告诉燃财经，资本寒冬已经持续了两三年时间，旅游行业死掉了大批公司，现在全球疫情无疑是雪上加霜，市场淘汰还将继续。
Wei told Caijing that the capital winter has lasted two or three years, the tourism industry has lost a large number of companies, now the global epidemic is no doubt worse, market obsolescence will continue.
图 / 视觉中国“剩下的在今年更不好过，有钱的企业就能多活，没钱又找不来钱的就会死掉。
Chart / Vision China "The rest of the year is worse off, with rich businesses living longer and people without money and money dying.
已经扛了两个月，再持续三四个月的话，很多企业肯定是扛不住的。
Has carried on for two months, continues for three or four months, many enterprises are certainly unable to carry.
政策上能给中小企业的支持也不多，房租、人力成本降不下来，可能只能裁员了。
Policy support for SMEs is also small, rent, manpower costs can not be reduced, may have to reduce the number of staff.
”魏长仁同时也给出建议。
Wei also gave advice.
他认为，专注出境外旅行的机构受到影响更大，不过还需要看国内的恢复情况。
In his view, agencies focused on travel abroad were more affected, although it would depend on the recovery at home.
据燃财经了解，携程情况最差时，国内订单至少损失了80%，如今国内业务正在逐步恢复，但是国际订单短期很难恢复。
At least 80% of domestic orders were lost when Ctrip fared worst, according to Ctrip Finance. Now the domestic business is recovering, but international orders are unlikely to recover in the short term.
携程方面对燃财经表示，“出境游、国际航班、高星酒店等业务在人数上不一定占大头，但收入和利润占比大，因此打击非常大。
"Outbound travel, international flights, high-star hotels and other businesses do not necessarily account for the bulk of the number of people, but the income and profits ratio is large, so the impact is very large," Ctrip said.
”在凯旋创投合伙人陶冶看来，疫情下受影响最大的莫过于旅游业。
In the eyes of Tao Ye, the victorious venture partner, the worst hit by the epidemic is tourism.
“周边的服务没有了，之前的预订不履约，未来业务也停滞了，但是企业人力、租金等硬成本照常支出，业务收入大幅下降，流动资金异常紧张，腹背受敌。
"Peripheral services are gone, previous bookings are not performing and future business is stagnating, but hard costs, such as manpower and rent, are being paid as usual, business revenues are down sharply, liquidity is tight, and business is running aground.
再加上原油暴跌的‘黑天鹅’事件，消费者对未来普遍缺乏信心，对旅游行业而言更是雪上加霜。
Coupled with the Black Swan case of plummeting crude oil, consumers' general lack of confidence in the future is making matters worse for the travel industry.
”他建议，旅游相关的企业要更加重视现金流，重新规划预算，尽最大努力缩减费用支出，增加现金储备，另一方面，多关注和研究政府的扶持政策细则，利用好优惠政策，减轻自身压力。
He recommends that travel-related companies pay more attention to cash flow, re-plan budgets, do their utmost to cut costs and increase cash reserves, and pay more attention to and study the details of the government's enabling policies, taking advantage of favorable policies to ease their pressure.
另外，携程方面也提到，对旅游行业而言，复工并不等于复产，真正有旅游收入才可以称之为复产。
In addition, Ctrip also mentioned that for the tourism industry, the resumption of work is not the same as the resumption of production, a real tourism revenue can be called resumption.
旅行社的产品往往是预售性质的，这就有一个“时间差”，比如5月以后或者6月以后的产品，可以提前预售，这对缓解旅行社现金流压力，有着积极的意义。
Travel agency products are often pre-sale, which has a "time difference", such as after May or June products, can be pre-sale, which will ease the travel agency cash flow pressure, has a positive significance.
手机行业拼的是供应链管理，赌的是供应商稳定国内疫情高峰已过，中国工厂正在积极恢复生产，一些城市的线下零售店铺刚刚陆续开张，而对于严重依赖全球供应链的手机厂商而言，他们的痛苦还没有结束。
The mobile-phone industry is battling supply-chain management, betting that the country's suppliers are stabilizing the epidemic, that Chinese factories are reviving production, that offline retail stores are opening in some cities, and that their pain is not over for handset manufacturers that are heavily dependent on global supply chains.
首先，需求侧，继续被压制。
First, the demand side continues to be suppressed.
“5G新机尤甚。
"The new 5G is even more so.
”志程手机负责人张贵海告诉燃财经，新机的销售闭环是先真机体验再购买，现在疫情进一步扩散，线下销售场景停滞，大量换机需求被压制。
Zhang Guihai, head of ZhiCheng's cellphone, told Flaming Finance that the new machine's sales loop was a first-come-first-served experience.
APUS创始人兼CEO李涛同样认为，中国的经济和美国的经济在2020年这个时点上都面临着挑战，如果具体到手机产业，取决于疫情结束的时间，就目前情况来看，整个手机产业不是由供应链来驱动的，而是由市场来拉动的，只要市场的消费需求和消费水平还在，疫情结束后就会出现报复性增长。
Li Tao, founder and CEO of APUS, agrees that China's economy and that of the US face challenges at this point in 2020, and that if the mobile phone industry is specific to the end of the epidemic, it is not supply-chain-driven but market-driven, with retaliatory growth as long as consumer and consumption levels remain in the market.
日前，美国市场调研公司Strategy Analytics预测，2020年全球智能手机出货量将比预期（疫情前的预测）少10%，中国智能手机的出货量将比预期减少15%。
Strategic Analytics, the US market research firm, recently predicted that global smartphone shipments would be 10 per cent lower than expected in 2020 and that Chinese smartphone shipments would be 15 per cent lower than expected.
华为作为全球第二大智能手机厂商，不但开始砍单5G手机，同时也将今年手机出货量下调了20%，这是华为近10年来首次下调出货量。
Huawei, the world's second-largest smartphone maker, has cut cellphone shipments by 20 per cent this year, the first such cut in nearly a decade.
苹果公司也于2月宣布一季度无法达成先前释放的营收预期区间。
Apple also announced in February that it would not be able to reach the revenue expectations it had previously released.
不过，张贵海从另一角度判断，有刚性的换机需求的用户，多数会购入已经有一定认知的4G手机，“今年手机市场的出货还是会以4G手机为主，主流的手机厂商都积攒了大量的4G手机库存，这对他们的库存消化、财务状况反而是一种优化。
However, judging from another angle, most users with rigid switching needs will buy 4G phones that are already well-known. "This year, mobile phone sales will still be dominated by 4G phones, with mainstream handset makers accumulating huge stocks of 4G phones, which is an optimization of their inventory and finances.
”图 / 视觉中国供给侧的影响更大。
The impact on the supply side of China is even greater.
一部手机，至少需要300个零件，基础零件国内自主，但关键元件还是受制于美、日、韩等企业。
A mobile phone needs at least 300 parts, the basic parts of domestic autonomy, but the key components are still subject to the United States, Japan, South Korea and other enterprises.
除了华为采用自家的麒麟芯片之外，其他手机厂商普遍搭载的是美国高通的芯片，内存主要来自韩日企业，目前这些国家的疫情严重程度不亚于国内。
In addition to Huawei's own Kirin chips, other handset makers typically carry high-tech chips from the United States, mostly from companies in South Korea and Japan, where the epidemic is no less severe than at home.
创势资本创始合伙人汤旭东告诉燃财经，2020年市场最看好的5G手机、柔性手机，在疫情前已经开始爆发了，但由于全球供应链的影响，销量开始下滑，目前基本处在停滞状态。
Tangshan Dong, founder partner of Venture Capital, told Caijing that the most popular 5G phones and flexible mobile phones in the 2020 market had begun to explode before the outbreak, but sales began to fall and are now largely at a standstill as a result of global supply chains.
“哪怕其中一个零件供应出现短缺，那么这款手机就无法量产，而等零件供应上了，生产出来了，可能这款机器已经落后了。
"Even if one of these parts is in short supply, it won't be mass-produced, and by the time the parts are available, it may be behind schedule.
”张贵海对燃财经表示，手机厂商现在比拼的就是供应链管理，谁家的规模大，谁家原来赌的供应商没有出问题，那么后发优势就会凸显。
Mr Zhang told Flammac that the competition among handset makers was for supply chain management, and the advantage of backwardness would come to the fore if there were no problems with the original suppliers.
据燃财经统计，截至3月12日，2020年国内手机厂商已经拿出11款5G手机，而且3月份后还会有一批5G手机蓄势待发。
As of March 12, domestic cellphone makers had already produced 11 5G phones by March 12, and a further batch of 5G phones is expected to be available after March, according to the finance and economics report.
“5G手机密集发布，不代表已经大规模量产了，手机行业有滞后期，现在没有问题不代表后期不会爆发出来。
"5G is not a mass release, it's not a mass production, there's a lag in the cellphone industry, and there's no problem that doesn't mean it won't happen later," he said.
哪家厂商受影响最严重，外界还无法评估，后期零售市场会反映出真实的情况。
It is not yet possible to assess which manufacturer will be the most seriously affected, and the later retail market will reflect the real situation.
”张贵海说。
"said Zhang.
汤旭东建议手机厂商在元件备货、市场投放方面放慢脚步，不要过于激进。
Tang Xudong recommends mobile phone manufacturers in the component stock, market release slow down, do not be too radical.
据他观察，华为、小米、苹果这些企业都已经在放慢速度。
Huawei, millet and Apple are already slowing down, he observes.
不过，手机厂商在供应端的危机可能是国内供应商的机会。
However, a crisis at the supply side could be an opportunity for domestic suppliers.
“就像口罩，你买不到N95级别的，那就只能买其他的。
"It's like a mask. If you can't buy an N95, you have to buy something else.
”张贵海称，在手机行业终端供应上，国内原本作为备用方案的、排名靠后的公司可能就有机会替补登场了。
Zhang Guihai said that in the mobile phone industry terminal supply, the domestic originally as a backup solution, ranked low-ranking companies may have the opportunity to substitute.
通信博士张峻恺同样认为，若疫情持续时间长，可能打破目前的手机供应链布局。
Communication Doctor Zhang Jukai agreed that if the epidemic lasted long enough, it might break the current configuration of the mobile supply chain.
在手机制造业身上，目前也看到了一些机会。
There are also opportunities in the mobile phone industry.
像富士康在疫情期间临时跨界到医疗行业生产口罩，截至3月1日，累计交货量已达400万只。
Like Foxconn, which temporarily moved across the border to produce masks in the medical industry during the epidemic, cumulative deliveries as of March 1 stood at four million.
同属制造业的格力、比亚迪也加入进来。
Gray, BYD, who are also manufacturers, joined in.
跨境电商国际业务供应链、物流运力、复工节奏被打乱近两个月的疫情，让跨境电商的优势也受到了一记重击。
Cross-border e-commerce international business supply chain, logistics capacity, the resumption of the pace of work has been disrupted for nearly two months, the advantages of cross-border electricity business has also been a blow.
据商务部数据，截至2020年2月20日，我国经各种贸易方式进口的口罩数量已超过12亿只，进口防护服超过1300万套。
According to Ministry of Commerce data, as of February 20, 2020, China has imported more than 1.2 billion masks and 13 million suits of protective clothing through various trade modes.
其中，59个跨境电商综合试验区的跨境电商平台和企业累计进口口罩超过5000万只，进口防护服近100万套。
Among them, 59 cross-boundary electrical business platforms and enterprises in the Comprehensive Test Area imported over 50 million face masks and imported nearly 1 million sets of protective clothing.
“两周前，防护用品在海外还是被国人抢购的状态，价格一天一变，谁钱多就能抢货，航运成本更是暴涨。
"Two weeks ago, protection was still being snapped up overseas by the Chinese, with prices changing day by day, who could snatch more money and shipping costs skyrocketed.
”洋码头CEO曾碧波表示。
Yang dock CEO Zeng Bibo said.
而当疫情这只蝴蝶扇动翅膀，影响的是全球60多个国家。
When the butterfly flapped its wings, it affected more than 60 countries around the world.
“你能不能把口罩退给我，我给你加费用。
"Can you give me the mask back? I'll pay for it.
”曾碧波接到了海外供应商打来的电话。
Mr Zeng has received calls from overseas suppliers.
这批货还剩下200-300万只口罩，曾碧波计划把运送到国内的进口物资送回欧洲。
With 2-3 million masks left in the shipment, Zeng plans to send imports back to Europe.
“意大利、德国疫情蔓延速度惊人，但是口罩已经没了，前段时间被中国人抢光了，现在得还回去。
"Italy, Germany spread the epidemic at an alarming rate, but the mask is no longer, the Chinese snatched up some time ago, now have to return.
现在国内防护用品的产能上来了。
Domestic protective equipment is now in production capacity.
”他说。
'he said.
据燃财经了解，电商平台用户疫情期间最关注的品类是口罩、消毒用品、保健品，而伴随疫情在国内趋于稳定，电商平台用户从早期购买防护口罩的需求居多，转化成为一次性口罩需求增长。
According to Caijing, the categories most concerned during the epidemic are masks, disinfectant products and health care products. With the epidemic stabilizing in China, the demand for protective masks among users of electrical and commercial platforms has increased.
图 / 视觉中国全球疫情告急，电商平台国际业务的供应链、物流运力、复工的节奏都再次被打乱。
Figure / Vision China's global epidemic is in crisis, the international business platform supply chain, logistics capacity, the pace of resumption of work has been disrupted once again.
首当其冲的是物流。
The first is logistics.
受疫情影响，各国航空公司、海运公司均出台了暂停中外主要航线的措施，单空运方面就波及北美、欧洲、亚洲、非洲、澳州等多个地区。
Affected by the epidemic, national airlines and shipping companies have put in place temporary suspension of the main domestic and foreign routes, the air transport alone will affect North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia and many other regions.
“从海外漂洋过海的时间会比较长，整个中美物流团队春节无休，整合运力，第一批口罩大约10天左右到达用户手中。
"Overseas travel will take a long time, the entire Chinese-American logistics team Spring Festival, integration of capacity, the first batch of masks about 10 days into the hands of users.
”别样APP方面对燃财经表示。
The other kind of APP side to combustion finance and economics.
创世伙伴资本合伙人聂冬辰认为，全球疫情的蔓延势必会影响全球化物流的运作，这会是未来一段时间内对外贸易面临的较大挑战，不过真正受到影响的是深度参与海外当地采购、仓储、物流、售后等大量面对面交付的公司。
The spread of the global epidemic is bound to affect the operation of global logistics, which will be a big challenge for foreign trade for some time to come, but the real impact will be on companies that are deeply involved in overseas local procurement, warehousing, logistics, aftersales and other large-scale face-to-face deliveries.
疫情是否会对电商平台的国际业务有长期影响，曾碧波表示，用户消费信心短期内会对高客单价如奢侈品的交易造成影响。
Whether the outbreak will have a long-term impact on the international business of telecoms platforms, Mr Tsang said consumer confidence would have a short-term impact on high-priced items such as luxury goods.
不过他更担心的是，这场疫情结束2-4个月内，全球贸易保护主义抬头。
But he is more worried about the rise in global protectionism within two to four months of the end of the epidemic.
“国外品牌都怕了，中国人的消费力太强了，他们怕把当地的资源抢走，可能会形成一些保护。
"The foreign brands are afraid, the Chinese people's spending power is too strong, they are afraid of the local resources, may form some protection.
”曾碧波说。
"said Zeng.
出海企业几家欢喜几家愁目前海外疫情的蔓延刚刚开始，多位投资人表示，出海企业将是几家欢喜几家愁。
At present, the spread of overseas epidemic has just begun, a number of investors said that the sea enterprises will be a few happy families.
聂冬辰认为，以线上业务为主的出海企业数据将普遍出现小范围爆发性增长；而以线下业务为主的企业，基于不同的市场区域和政府管控的及时性，将会出现小幅度放缓。
Nie Dongchen believes that online business-based data will generally have a small burst of growth, while the main offline businesses, based on different market areas and the timeliness of government regulation, will experience a small slowdown.
特定行业如大型赛事、娱乐活动等会面临较大挑战。
Certain industries, such as large-scale events and recreational activities, will face greater challenges.
某出海赛道投资人则将出海企业分为两类，一类是传统的卖货企业，另一类是产品类企业，如字节跳动、猎豹移动等。
A certain sea-going investors will be divided into two types of enterprises, one is the traditional selling enterprises, and the other is the product category enterprises, such as byte jumping, cheetah movement, etc.
他认为前者受影响主要与供应链相关。
He argued that the former were mainly affected by supply chains.
一方面，复工时间不确定，武汉及整个湖北原是主要劳动力供给地之一，这些区域一旦封锁，相当于国内少了1/5-1/8的劳动生产力。
On the one hand, the resumption of work time is uncertain, Wuhan and the entire Hubei Province is one of the main labor supply areas, once blockaded, the equivalent of a quarter of the domestic labor productivity.
另一方面是物流方面的海运及航运，航运频次高，一般跨境飞机客舱下的空间都会被当作货仓，近期航线停滞、班次骤减，就无法按原定线路运货；海运周期较长，现在已经漂在海上的货品影响不大，受影响的主要是现在发货、6月到货的一批，本身工人供给不足，国内运输也受到限制，供给十分紧张。
On the other hand, maritime and shipping aspects of logistics, high frequency of shipping, general cross-boundary aircraft cabin space will be used as cargo warehouse, the recent stagnation of shipping routes, the sharp decline in shifts, the impact of the longer shipping cycle, now floating goods, mainly now shipped, June shipments, their own workers supply constraints, domestic transport constraints, very tight supply.
产品类、娱乐类、工具类公司，主要面临的是人力沟通的压力。
Products, entertainment, tools and other companies, mainly facing the pressure of human communication.
这些企业需要到当地进行交流对接，目前受疫情限制无法出境。
These companies need to go to the local exchange and docking, currently limited by the epidemic can not cross the border.
对主打流量工具和内容产品的出海企业来说，APUS创始人兼CEO李涛认为，压力来自沟通效率降低和客户减少，在过去这两个月里面，10%-15%的出海企业都受到了疫情的影响。
For companies out at sea that use traffic tools and content products, the company's founder and CEO, Li Tao, says the pressure comes from less efficient communication and fewer customers, with 10% to 15% of businesses at sea affected by the epidemic in the past two months.
另外，包括世界移动通信大会MWC、游戏开发者大会GDC、I/O开发者大会等各大展会的取消也对这些企业的业务产生不利影响。
In addition, the cancellation of major exhibitions, including the MWC at the World Mobile Congress, the GDC at the Game Developers' Conference and the I / O Developers' Conference, have also had a negative impact on the business of these companies.
图 / 视觉中国李涛表示，全球的人员流动中断，大量面对面交流的缺失、展会的取消，导致沟通效率变低、全球创新思想的传播交流受限，对科技产品、软硬件的开发，都将是不利影响。
Graphic / Visual China Li Tao said that the global disruption of human mobility, the absence of a lot of face-to-face communication, the cancellation of exhibitions, resulting in lower communication efficiency, limited dissemination of global innovative ideas, and development of technology products, software and hardware will all be adversely affected.
但危中存机，也将倒逼出一种更逼近现实的沟通方式，“5G、AR、VR以及全息投影、传感器领域都会迎来一波利好。
But the crisis will also force a more realistic way of communicating: "5G, AR, VR, and holographic projection, sensor will usher in a wave of good."
”李涛称。
"said Li Tao.
针对出海企业以及市场在海外的中国企业，聂冬辰建议他们提高对新政策的应对能力。
For offshore companies and Chinese companies with overseas markets, Mr Nie advised them to be more responsive to the new policy.
“任何出海公司在海外都会面临着当地的法律法规和商业红线，在疫情蔓延期间，各国一定会出台各项措施予以应对。
"Any overseas company will be faced with local laws and regulations and red lines of commerce, and countries will certainly put in place measures to deal with it during the epidemic."
这是巨大的挑战，也意味着新的机会。
This is a great challenge and represents a new opportunity.
”另外，相较于国内移动互联网的成熟度，大量海外市场还处于中早期阶段，中国出海公司过去需要被动接受原始的习惯与规则场景，但如今传统交易场景失效，是否快速创造新的交易场景、占据交易主动性、设定交易规则也至关重要。
In addition, while a large number of overseas markets are in the early to medium stages compared with the maturity of the domestic mobile internet, Chinese seagoing companies used to have to passively accept the rudimentary set of customs and rules, but now the traditional trading scene is broken, and it is crucial to quickly create new trading scenarios, gain initiative and set trading rules.
“其实从2019年开始，出海企业就开始受到中美贸易冲突的影响，当时企业就应该意识到要管理好现金流，疫情只是将这件事放大了。
"Starting in 2019, businesses are beginning to be affected by the Sino-US trade conflict, and they should be aware that cash flows need to be managed, and the epidemic has only magnified this.
”李涛表示。
"said Li Tao.
在线产品利好将在海外重演全球疫情之下大多数人隔离在家，线下业态受到冲击的同时，一些线上产品和服务迎来了流量红利。
The benefits of online products will be replicated overseas, with most people isolated at home in the face of a global epidemic, with some online products and services receiving a flow dividend while the offline economy suffers.
英诺天使基金合伙人王晟表示，疫情中明显利好的首先是游戏行业。
Sheng Wang, a partner at the Inuit Angel Fund, said the game industry was the first to benefit from the outbreak.
他告诉燃财经，中国游戏的市场份额已经是全球第一了，这几年中国游戏企业全球化节奏走得很快，像腾讯、FunPlus等在全球化竞争中都取得了非常好的成绩，这次疫情，这些公司在全球的市场会继续增长。
In recent years, Chinese gaming companies have gone global at a fast pace, with companies like Tencent and FunPlus achieving very good results in the global competition. This time, they will continue to grow in the global market.
赤子城日前发布的业绩报告显示，2019年经调净利润增长超过60%，产品业务收入增长超过100%，其中游戏品类增长明显。
Net profit rose by more than 60 per cent in 2019, while revenues from product lines have risen by more than 100 per cent, with games showing a marked increase, according to a report released yesterday.
“主打游戏出海的公司很有可能复制国内春节期间的游戏热潮，随着全球多地的大面积的隔离，线下娱乐活动的减少，游戏会迎来一个大的爆发期。
"Companies playing games at sea are likely to replicate the national Spring Festival craze, and with widespread global isolation and reduced offline recreation, the game will experience a major burst.
”赤子城创始人刘春河给出建议：游戏产品可以大胆出海，但也要谨慎，需要提前理解本土化需求。
Liu Chunhe, founder of Chizi City, suggested that game products could be put to sea boldly, but with caution and a need to understand local needs in advance.
游戏之外，他也看到了娱乐、社交、教育、健康、办公等在线产品的市场机会，他认为，国内这些类型的产品都获得了爆发式的增长，这种情况接下来也很可能在海外重演。
In addition to the games, he sees market opportunities for online products such as entertainment, social networking, education, health and office, which he believes have grown exponentially in China and are likely to be replicated overseas.
在陶冶看来，云服务、线上娱乐、线上教育等线上业务及金融服务受影响有限甚至是利好，疫情是用户教育的时机，也是快速发展的窗口期，甚至还催生了新需求，无接触形式的服务和公共服务设施的无接触改造都会成为热点。
In Tao's view, online business and financial services, such as cloud services, online entertainment, online education, are limited or even good. The epidemic is a time for user education and a window for rapid growth, and has even created new demand, with non-contact forms of service and access to public services becoming hot spots.

Photo / Visual China letter day venture partner Zhang Junxi told Flaming Finance, letter day venture was shot to do on-line study abroad intermediary services on the business during the epidemic period significantly improved.
据介绍，这家公司全部服务交互都是在线化的，最近留学礼包价格上调，访问流量与去年同期相比反而增加了一倍以上。
According to the report, the company's entire service interaction is online, the recent increase in gift package prices, access to the same period last year has more than doubled.
陶冶还表示，人工智能、物联网、大数据、5G、云技术等高科技在疫情中的多个方面表现出众，大数据、云服务是疫情管控的得力助手；5G云端智能消杀、测温、导诊、运输机器人，也快速加入到抗击疫情的战斗中；无人化操作很大程度上降低了接触性传染和交叉感染的概率，提升了医护人员的效率。
Artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, big data, 5G, cloud technology and other high-tech technologies excel in many aspects of the epidemic, Tao said. Large-scale data and cloud services are key support in epidemic control.
“此次的疫情在一定程度上加速了新一代信息技术在各个行业里的应用、融合，提升了机构和人们对于新技术的接受度。
"To a certain extent, this epidemic has accelerated the application and integration of the new generation of information technology in various industries and improved the acceptance of new technologies by institutions and people."
”陶冶对燃财经表示。
Tao Ye told Flaming Finance.
医疗类企业的利好更是多个层面的。
Healthcare enterprises are more positive on many levels.
陶冶提到，从最底层看，医院信息化、数字化的需求迫在眉睫，互联网与医疗的结合能更大限度满足患者咨询、问诊、网上医疗的需求，打通网上挂号、医院就诊渠道。
From the lowest level, the needs of hospital informatization and digitization are pressing, Tao said. The combination of Internet and medicine can meet the needs of consultation, consultation and online medical treatment to a greater extent.
此外，人工智能在药物研发环节、基因测序技术上是无可替代的角色。
In addition, artificial intelligence plays an irreplaceable role in drug research and development and gene sequencing.
原研药物的研发，也将是未来最核心的变革方向。
The research and development of original research and development will also be the most core direction of change in the future.
未来预测国内市场迎来3-4个月的时间差就宏观层面而言，陶冶认为目前明确的底层变量有三：中美持续角力、新冠疫情、石油危机。
At the macro level, Tao believes there are three clear bottom variables: China-US persistent fighting, the new crown epidemic, and the oil crisis.
国内来看，PMI（综合采购经理指数）已经跌到比2008年金融危机更低的历史低位，阵痛远超SARS期间。
Domestically, the PMI (composite purchasing manager index) has fallen to an all-time low compared to the 2008 financial crisis, with pains far greater than during the SARS period.
放眼世界，全球PMI也在剧烈下降。
Around the world, global PMI is also plummeting.
因此对于国内而言，除去防疫相关用品的出口外，二季度总体贸易出口大概率会受较大影响。
Therefore, for domestic, except for the export of epidemic prevention-related supplies, the overall trade export probability in the second quarter will be greatly affected.
美股表现排进历史最差前三，联储非常规降息后可能还会继续降息，但是调整空间已经非常有限（目前已经1%以内）。
U.S. stocks are among the worst in history, and the Fed is likely to cut interest rates further after its unconventional rate cuts, but there is already limited room for manoeuvre (now within 1%).
回看国内，中国目前支撑资本市场的三个关键因素：疫情、货币政策、需求，虽然内需部分会受到一定冲击，但三个因素都相对稳定，整体不断向好，所以中国股市跑过全球指数是有支撑的。
Looking back at home, China has three key factors underpinning capital markets: contagion, monetary policy, and demand. While the domestic demand sector will be hit to some extent, all three factors are relatively stable and are generally improving, so there is support for China's stock market to cross the global index.
反观美国，三因素都不稳定，经济危机的风险加剧，给海外的中国企业带来了更大的风险。
In the United States, however, all three factors are unstable and the risk of an economic crisis increases, posing greater risks to Chinese companies overseas.
总得来说，疫情表现出的极高的群体传染性，让所有依赖面对面感知、交付以及服务的业态都会受到强烈冲击。
Overall, the epidemic is highly contagious, leaving all businesses that rely on face-to-face perception, delivery, and service delivery to be severely impacted.
“目前在国内可以清晰地看到，传统制造业、线下生活服务、传统线下教育、体育活动等方面都会受到较大影响，包括美国NBA停赛，影响是全球化的。
"It is now clear at home that traditional manufacturing, off-line living services, traditional offline education, sports and so on will all be affected, including the NBA suspension in the United States, and the impact will be global.
”聂冬辰称。
Nie Dongchen said.
但从另一方面来讲，他认为，无论是供给曲线还是需求曲线，在绝大部分的行业中都具有较强的弹性。
On the other hand, he argues, supply and demand curves are resilient in most industries.
因此在这些业态中如果出现较高替代性的方案，哪怕在体验和质量方面只能达到过去的80%，也会成为用户的重点追捧对象。
Therefore, the emergence of higher alternative solutions in these industries, even in terms of experience and quality can reach the past 80 per cent, will also become the focus of users.
李涛更担心的是疫情的持续时间。
Li Tao is more worried about the duration of the outbreak.
他认为，如果疫情只持续一到两个月左右，对企业的影响还可以承担，但如果长期持续下去，影响将不可估量。
He believes that if the epidemic continues for only a month or two, the impact on businesses can be borne, but if sustained over the long term, the impact will be immeasurable.
“中国是制造业大国，如果疫情造成大量的制造业企业不能复工，将会直接影响整个中国的消费水平。
"China is a big manufacturing country and if the epidemic results in a large number of manufacturing enterprises not being able to return to work, it will directly affect the consumption level of China as a whole."
中国同样是出口大国，出口作为国家经济发展的三驾马车之一，一直是我国经济最重要的支撑力量之一，如果疫情继续蔓延，对中国整体经济也将造成不利影响。
As an export powerhouse, China's exports, as one of the troika for the country's economic development, have always been one of the most important supporting forces for our economy.
”据李涛预测，先是影响出口，紧跟着是出海企业，接下来会传导到整个互联网行业。
Li Tao predicts that it will affect exports first, followed by companies at sea and then the entire Internet industry.
以游戏为例，游戏在疫情期间实际上是网络“口红效应”的表现，如果经济因疫情全球扩散出现较大波动，消费者因收入降低影响消费欲望，行业将遭受打击。
Take games, for example, during the epidemic is in fact the network "lipstick effect" performance, if the economy because of the spread of large fluctuations in the global epidemic, consumers because of lower income affect consumer desire, the industry will be hit.
但如果疫情在两个月以内得到有效控制，中国的科技创新类赛道，如电商，特别是生鲜电商行业、在线教育、游戏等，还有企业（政府）信息化的赛道，都会迎来逆势增长。
But if the epidemic is brought under effective control within two months, China's science, technology and innovation tracks, such as electronics, especially fresh electricity, online education, games, and enterprise (government) information technology, will experience a counter-trend increase.
图 / 视觉中国不过在刘春河看来，疫情对全球互联网行业的影响微乎其微，对实体行业的影响倒是长久的，对其中部分行业的打击甚至是致命的。
But according to Liu Chunhe, the impact of the epidemic on the global Internet industry has been minimal, while the impact on the real sector has been long-lasting, with some of the sectors even fatal.
因为海外各国的气候情况、医疗条件、社会管理水平层次不齐，全球的疫情发展并不好下断论。
Because the overseas countries have different levels of climate, medical conditions and social management, the development of the global epidemic is not a good conclusion.
“对于现在普遍所说的疫情影响到六七月份会消失，我是不太乐观的。
"I am not very optimistic that what is now widely known as the epidemic will disappear in June and July.
”刘春河对燃财经表示。
Liu Chunhe told Flaming Finance.
在陶冶看来，整体是长期向好的，国内可能好于海外，但同时也必须有警觉，短期会存在多方风险，需要谨慎。
In Tao Ye, the whole is good in the long run and may be better at home than abroad, but at the same time must be alert to the short-term risks and the need for caution.
上述出海赛道投资人也持有相同观点，同时他认为，海外没有迅速重视疫情，相当于留给中国至少3-4个月时间差，可优先于海外迅速组织恢复产能，进行逆向输出。
The same view is shared by the aforementioned SeaTrack investors, who argue that the lack of a rapid overseas focus on the epidemic is equivalent to leaving China with a time lag of at least three to four months to restore capacity and reverse export ahead of rapid overseas organizations.
“我相信中国企业在整个团队的管理上和敬业程度上要远高于海外企业，接下来这段时间，依旧能输出稳定、高质量服务和产品的，可能就是中国企业。
"I believe that Chinese companies are much better at managing and being committed to the whole team than overseas companies, and it is probably Chinese companies that will be able to export stable, high-quality services and products over the next few months."
