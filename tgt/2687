新冠肺炎疫情期间，少出门、勤洗手、戴口罩已经深深地刻在国人脑子里。
During the New Crown Pneumonia outbreak, less out of home, frequent hand washing, wearing masks have been deeply engraved in the minds of the Chinese people.
不过，在疫情逐渐扩散的欧洲，戴口罩的反而成为异类，可能被“歧视”。
In Europe, however, where the epidemic is spreading, masks are becoming alien and may be "discriminated against."
女议员因戴口罩被赶出议会大厅根据当地时间3月3日18时意大利卫生部公布的最近数据，意大利现有新冠病毒患者2263例，死亡79例，治愈160例，累计确诊感染新冠病毒总人数为2502例，较3月2日18时新增466例，其中重症229例，新增27例死亡病例。

当地卫生部门给予全体国民的建议仍然是：“如果没有生病，不建议佩戴口罩”。
"If you're not sick, don't recommend wearing a mask," the local health department's advice to all residents remains.
2月26日，意大利一名议员戴着口罩进入议会，然而却因此被嘲。
On February 26, an Italian parliamentarian entered parliament wearing a mask, but was ridiculed for doing so.
在发言时，他情绪激动，将口罩摘下，对着大家说“自己去过三个疫区，戴口罩是为大家安全着想，如果你们是聪明人，你们也早就戴上口罩了”，说完，他怒摔话筒。
In his speech, he took off his mask and said to everyone, "I have been to three affected areas, wearing masks for the safety of everyone, if you are smart, you would have put on a mask long ago," he said, throwing the microphone.

3月3日，瑞士女议员出席联邦委员会会议时，因坚持戴口罩被逐出会议大厅。
On 3 March, Swiss women parliamentarians were expelled from the conference hall for insisting on wearing masks while attending a meeting of the Federal Council.
图片来源：《一瞥报》瑞士媒体报道称，该名人民党女议员布劳赫为当天全场唯一戴口罩的人，瑞士联邦议会国民院议长认为此举扰乱会议秩序，要求其摘下口罩或离开会场。
Source: Swiss media reported that the PPP congresswoman, Brouh, was the only person wearing a mask on the day, and the President of the National Council of the Swiss Federal Assembly ordered her to remove her mask or leave the meeting, according to Swiss media reports.
布劳赫对此表示不解并拒绝摘下口罩。
Brauchs puzzled and refused to take off his mask.
双方协商后，她被允许在投票时进入会场。
After consultations between the parties, she was allowed to enter the venue during the voting.
该名议员表示，此举系为避免被感染或传染他人。
The congressman said the move was to avoid being infected or infecting others.
瑞士是全球受新冠病毒感染最严重的20国之一。
Switzerland is one of the 20 most affected countries in the world.
据瑞士媒体报道，截至当地时间4日早上8时，瑞士境内确诊病例总计58例，2例治愈出院。
As of 8 a.m. local time, 58 cases had been confirmed in Switzerland and 2 cases had been cured, according to Swiss media reports.
瑞士联邦政府上周宣布至少至3月15日取消1000人以上的大型集会。
The Swiss federal government announced last week that it would cancel more than 1,000 large gatherings until at least March 15.
此外政府还要求民众遵守如下规则：1.打招呼时避免握手或拥抱；2.将用过的纸巾丢弃在密闭的垃圾箱中；3.如有症状要事先联系各州市紧急联系电话，说明情况后再去急诊室。
In addition, the government requires people to observe the following rules: 1. Avoid shaking hands or hugging when greeting; 2. Discard used tissues in a closed garbage can; 3.
欧洲多国：健康人不需要戴口罩其实，不只意大利和瑞士不建议戴口罩，包括法国、德国、英国等政府发布的官方防疫手册给出的建议基本类似：不需要。
Europe's many countries: Healthy people do not need masks. In fact, Italy and Switzerland are not the only countries that do not recommend wearing masks.
总的来说，这些欧洲国家的防疫手册都遵循了世卫组织的建议，强调了如下几点：勤洗手、咳嗽或打喷嚏时用手臂捂住、使用一次性纸巾、避免握手和不必要的身体接触等。
In general, the vaccination manuals of these European countries follow WHO recommendations and emphasize the following points: frequent hand washing, placing a hand over one's arm when coughing or sneezing, using disposable tissues, avoiding shaking hands and unnecessary physical contact.
英国NHS表示，口罩在医院等场所非常重要，但是几乎没有证据显示，用口罩遮住口鼻可以降低健康人感染新冠病毒的概率。
The NHS says masks are important in places such as hospitals, but there is little evidence that covering the mouth and nose with a mask reduces the chance of a healthy person contracting the new crown virus.
口罩的作用主要是防止病人将疾病传播给别人，因此那些已经有症状的人才需要佩戴口罩。
Masks are designed to prevent patients from spreading the disease to others, so people who already have symptoms need to wear masks.
意大利卫生部援引世卫组织的说法，认为只有如下几类人才需要戴口罩：那些可能与病人有过接触的人、出现了咳嗽打喷嚏等症状的人、正在照顾疑似/确诊病人的人，以及医院的医护工作者。
The Italian Ministry of Health quoted WHO as saying that masks were only needed for certain categories of persons: those who might have come into contact with patients, those who developed symptoms such as coughing and sneezing, those taking care of suspected / confirmed patients, and hospital health workers.
此外，在意大利北部的红色疫区——罗马涅、伦巴第、威尼托三个大区——民众应当佩戴口罩。
Moreover, in northern Italy's red-infected regions - Romagna, Lombardy, and Veneto - people should wear masks.
德国卫生部指出，普通人群佩戴口罩“没有意义”，应该将防疫重点放在个人卫生上。
The German Health Ministry said the general population wearing masks "meaningless", should focus on personal hygiene immunization.
只有通过正确的方式佩戴口罩（例如有胡子的男性需要先刮光胡子等）、并保持一定频度的更换，否则接触被污染的口罩反而会带来感染风险。
Wear a mask correctly (men with a beard, for example, need to shave their moustaches first) and change them frequently. Otherwise, contact with contaminated masks carries a risk of infection.
戴口罩还可能让人产生一种有安全感的错觉，从而忽略了其他卫生措施，如勤洗手。
Wearing masks may also create the illusion of security and neglect other hygiene measures, such as frequent hand washing.
卫生部建议，民众如果出现了感冒的相关症状，应与家庭医生沟通，再决定是否佩戴、如何佩戴、以及佩戴哪一种型号的口罩。
The ministry recommends that people who develop symptoms associated with colds communicate with family doctors before deciding whether to wear them, how to wear them, and which type of mask to wear.
法国卫生部建议，如果你曾在过去两周到过特定区域，如中国、新加坡、朝鲜、伊朗、意大利北部三大区，可以佩戴口罩。
The French health ministry suggests wearing masks if you have visited specific areas in the past two weeks, such as China, Singapore, North Korea, Iran and northern Italy.
但也强调，带有呼吸阀的口罩如ffp2应该留给医护人员。
But it was also stressed that respirators with respirators, such as ffp2, should be reserved for medical staff.
当地华人：口罩戴或不戴，都是一个问题面对欧洲多国“健康人士没有必要戴口罩”的建议，身处当地的华人多少有些尴尬：戴口罩怕被认为“有病”，不戴口罩害怕感染病毒。
Local Chinese: Wearing or not wearing masks is a problem in the face of advice from many European countries that "healthy people don't have to wear masks." Chinese in the region are somewhat embarrassed to wear masks for fear of being considered "sick" and of getting infected without a mask.
钱江晚报报道，李加越，温州人，今年40岁，2000年5月到意大利。
Qian Jiang Evening News reported that Li Jiayue, a native of Wenzhou, 40 years old, arrived in Italy in May 2000.
之后，他和妻子贺思欧与人合作，在马尔凯大区创办了意大利马尔凯国际中文学校。
Later, in cooperation with his wife, Hessio, he founded the International Chinese School in Marquez, Italy.
该区以工业著称，在当地有4万多名华人华侨，他们大多从事鞋包加工。
Known for its industry, the region has more than 40,000 Chinese overseas Chinese, mostly engaged in shoe-packing.
“现在意大利新冠肺炎疫情越来越严重，人心惶惶。
"There is a growing fear of a new outbreak of pneumonia in Italy.
生活用品倒是没多大问题，主要是意大利政府的政策和我们华人的防护意识有矛盾。
The main problem is the policy of the Italian government and our Chinese people's sense of defense.
从病毒暴发开始，华人一直在强调要戴口罩，少出门，停工停学。
Since the outbreak of the virus, the Chinese have been emphasizing wearing masks, going out less and stopping school.
但是意大利政府的防控疫情政策不一样，他们说‘生病的人才戴口罩，新冠肺炎病毒只是比流感危险一点点，没必要停工停学’。
But Italy's government has a different policy of prevention and control, saying 'sick people wear masks, and the New Crown Pneumonia virus is only a little more dangerous than flu.
”李加越说，这样就给当地华人造成了苦恼：出门戴口罩，还是不戴口罩。
Mr. Li says this has caused distress to local Chinese: go out wearing masks, or don't wear masks.
意大利当地时间3月2日，温州籍华侨、意大利中意青年联合会会长郑再生在佛罗伦萨一商场购物，看到意大利人没戴口罩，他也就不戴了，把口罩放在了口袋里。
Zheng Regan, an overseas Chinese from Wenzhou and head of the Italian Association of Chinese-Italian Youth, stopped wearing a mask at a shop in Florence and put it in his pocket.
“这里的许多意大利人都不戴口罩，华人戴口罩会被他们指责。
"Many Italians here don't wear masks, and Chinese are blamed for wearing them.
”郑再生说，他从事进出口贸易，目前他的生意和生活都受到疫情的影响。
Mr Cheng said he was involved in the import and export trade and that his business and life were now affected by the epidemic.
温州籍华侨邵胜东家住罗马。
The Wenzhou Chinese owner Shao Sheng lived in Rome.
目前，他所在的拉齐奥区新冠肺炎确诊7例。
At present, he is located in Lazio District New Crown Pneumonia diagnosis of 7 cases.
“我有点心慌。
"I'm a little nervous.
目前意大利政府针对疫情的防护措施不统一。
The Italian government's response to the epidemic is not uniform.
普通民众要不要戴口罩，是目前最纠结的问题之一。
Whether ordinary people should wear masks or not is one of the most vexing issues.
现在我们华人处于进退两难中。
Now we Chinese are in a dilemma.
前段时间我备了几个口罩，但现在疫情严重起来，口罩吃紧。
Some time ago I had a few masks, but now the epidemic is serious, the mask is tight.
”邵胜东说，目前能做的就是先保护好自己和家人，此外他的服装店生意受到很大影响，最近很少有顾客光顾。
'What we can do now is to protect ourselves and his family, 'Mr. Shaw said.' In addition, his clothing business has been badly affected and few customers have visited recently.
值得注意的是，居住在意大利、法国、英国的多位华人均表示，实体药店里已经很难寻觅口罩的踪影，网店里也多显示脱销，如果想要购买口罩只能通过华人群体“自寻渠道”。
It is worth noting that many Chinese living in Italy, France and the United Kingdom say that it is difficult to find face masks in the physical pharmacies, and that many online shops are showing signs of being sold out.
