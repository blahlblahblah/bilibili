深度和角度——这就是我们能做的。

医护人员冲锋在一线有需要，我们国企和其他企业就要一起做好后勤保障工作，挑起企业抗击疫情的责任担当，相信众志成城、共克时艰不是一句空话，大家一起努力，疫情终将过去，一切都会好起来。
Our state-owned enterprises and other enterprises should do a good job in logistics support together, instigate enterprises to bear the responsibility of fighting the epidemic. We believe that this will not be an empty word. We will work together, the epidemic will be over and everything will be fine.
口述 | 周 道整理 | 周 洁小年夜晚上大概10点左右，我收到微信消息，公司的领导班子需要讨论一件重要事情，马上。
At about 10 o'clock last night, I received a message that the company's leadership needed to discuss an important matter, right away.
尽管时间不早了，但我和班子成员们还是第一时间连上线。
Despite the lateness of the hour, my squad and I were on line for the first time.
原来，随着1月20日晚上钟南山院士对于疫情的研判发出后，市面上许多医疗物资已经处于紧缺状态，上海本地的医疗物资库存也开始短缺了。
As a result, many medical supplies are already in short supply and stocks of local medical supplies in Shanghai are beginning to fall short as Academician Zhong Nan Shan studies the outbreak on the night of January 20.
于是，上海市商委在1月23日当晚召集企业开会，要求在座的国有企业想方设法通过各自的海外采购渠道，紧急采购一批医疗物资，他们还准备了一份清单，里面有口罩、防护服、护目镜，还有一些医疗器械设备等。
So on the evening of January 23, the Shanghai Merchants Committee called a meeting of enterprises and asked the state-owned enterprises present to find ways to procure medical supplies urgently through their respective overseas procurement channels. They also prepared a list of masks, protective clothing, goggles and some medical equipment.
我们是上海建工外经集团旗下上海市机械设备成套（集团）有限公司所属的一家进出口公司，我是该公司的党支部书记兼副总经理，说实话我们对于这些医疗耗材并不熟悉，尽管进口过一些医疗设备，我们主要业务还是进口工业原材料和市政工程的大型机电成套设备。
I am the secretary and deputy general manager of the Party branch of Shanghai Construction Engineering Exchanges Group Co. Ltd. To be honest, we are not familiar with these medical consumables. Although some medical equipment has been imported, our main business is import of industrial raw materials and municipal engineering large-scale electrical and mechanical equipment.
疫情就是命令，当我们的医护人员开始最美逆行抗击疫情时，我们作为国企要有担当要有作为，我们班子统一思想明确任务后，成立了疫情物资筹备工作组。
The epidemic is the command, when our medical staff began to fight the most beautiful retrograde epidemic, we as a state-owned enterprises have to do, our team unified thinking clear mandate, the establishment of epidemic materials preparatory working group.
我们班子当时的想法是医疗物资不是普通商品在海外也是属于医疗监管的专业领域，要在短短几天找到卖家能供应一定的数量价格也适中，那就一定要找到一些在海外社会关系广泛的合作伙伴帮忙。
The idea of our team was that medical supplies were not just ordinary goods, but medical supervision, too. To find sellers in a matter of days and to be able to supply certain quantities and at moderate prices, it was important to find partners with extensive social connections overseas.
为此我们抽调了公司大半的人员，分成了三个项目协调小组，工作组指导小组成员在欧洲市场、东南亚市场、美洲市场联系我们当地的合作伙伴，看看他们是否能够提供一些采购线索。
To that end, we have drawn up more than half of the company's staff into three project coordination teams, whose members contact our local partners in the European, South-East Asian and American markets to see if they can provide some procurement leads.
第二批口罩运抵上海后，公司小伙伴的合影找遍世界终于发现货源刚开始做这个工作千头万绪，我们遇到了不少困难。
After the second batch of masks arrived in Shanghai, the company's small partners in the world finally found that the source has just started to do this work, we encountered a lot of difficulties.
首先，我们毕竟不是做医疗耗材的进出口公司，我们对于它们的产品标准并不清楚。
First of all, we are not the import and export companies doing medical supplies, we are not clear about their product standards.
例如，有渠道反馈回来一家国外公司的防护服，产品手册上的这些防护服用途各异等级不同，员工也不清楚哪些是我们需要的哪些并不合适。
For example, there is a source of feedback on the protective clothing of a foreign company, the use of the protective clothing in the product manual varies from grade to grade, and employees do not know which suits we need and which are not.
为此，我们工作组引导业务员做了常用医疗物资如口罩、防护服和护目镜等的标准梳理。
To this end, our working group led the sales staff to make common medical supplies such as masks, protective clothing and goggles standard combing.
以口罩为例，区分医用级和非医用级，每个级别里有多少不同标识、型号和用途，同时各国的标准有哪些，哪些标准是符合国内医用物资标准，让合作伙伴有这份标准找起物资来就有的放矢了。
In the case of masks, it is important to distinguish between medical and non-medical levels, how many different labels, models and uses are available at each level, what are the national standards and which are in line with national standards for medical supplies, so that partners have the criteria to target supplies.
其次，医疗物资的品质和价格要找到一个平衡点。
Secondly, a balance should be found between the quality and price of medical materials.
最初几日有些渠道反馈回来的信息是这些海外物资的价格都在哄抬上扬，而且从发回的物资照片看质量也参差不齐。
Some sources reported back on the first few days that prices were rising and that the quality of the material sent back was uneven.
我们工作组马上和业务员强调了，疫情期间的物资价格可以比平时高一点但不能离谱，同时一定要保证质量，不能采购进来的医疗物资出现伪劣不合格产品。
Our working group and sales staff immediately stressed that the price of materials during the epidemic can be a little higher than usual but not outrageous, while at the same time must ensure the quality of medical supplies can not be procured counterfeit and substandard products.
再次，就是海外医疗物资也开始进入短缺状态。
Third, even overseas medical supplies are starting to fall short.
我们的合作伙伴收到我们采购信息后，纷纷联系当地的生产企业、药房和大型超市。
When our partners received our purchasing information, they contacted local manufacturers, pharmacies and large supermarkets.
然而结果并不理想，要么数量少要么不符合标准或者价格虚高。
However, the results were not ideal, either in small quantities or below standard or at inflated prices.
各小组的海外采购陷入了僵局。
Overseas procurement by the groups is at an impasse.
可就在1月28日那天晚上，一个好消息传来了，一位名叫杨聿扬的业务部门经理说他那里找到货源了，第一批19万，第二批还在落实中，数量也不会少。
But on the evening of January 28, a good news came. Pei Yang, a business manager, said he had found supplies there, the first batch was 190,000, and the second batch was still being carried out.
我们整个团队为之欣喜。
Our entire team was delighted.
原来我们这位老杨，翻遍了他的名片和微信朋友圈，找到了一位德籍华人王先生，王先生过去和我们公司在工业设备上有过多年合作，过往的合作经历让老杨十分信任其为人和丰富的社会关系。
Mr. Wang, a German-Chinese, has worked with us on industrial equipment for many years, and his past cooperation has given Lao Yang great confidence in his personal and rich social connections.
这位远在德国埃森的王先生说，他的多位亲戚朋友，正处于疫情爆发的核心地带——武汉，因此他的内心十分不安。
Mr. Wang, who lives far away in Essen, Germany, said many of his relatives and friends were in Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, and felt uneasy inside.
此时杨聿扬的跨国电话无疑让二人一拍即合。
Pei at this point in the transnational telephone let two people pat immediately.
可当王先生挂完电话联系多家药房和超市后，发现市场上能零售买到的医疗物资已几无存货了，原来当地不少中国留学生和华侨已经在马不停蹄地往国内运送口罩等医疗物资了。
But after Mr. Wang hung up the phone and contacted several pharmacies and supermarkets, he found that there were few medical supplies available for retail sale. Many local Chinese students and overseas Chinese were already carrying medical supplies such as masks to China.
王先生跟老杨说他认识一位德国医生朋友，这位德国医生应该有不少医疗圈的人脉关系和资源，等回音。
Mr. Wang told Lao Yang that he knew a German doctor friend who should have a lot of contacts and resources in the medical community, waiting to hear back.
果然第二天传来了好消息：这个德国医生牵线搭桥找到了一批在德国法兰克福的法国产医用外科口罩而且价格合理。
The good news came the next day when the German doctor brokered a fair supply of French-made medical surgical masks in Frankfurt, Germany.
当时比对国内标准后为了再确认该口罩是否适合医用，我还专门请教了瑞金医院的重症室专家，当DOUBLE CHECK后，我们才定下心让老杨迅速锁定货源立即空运回国。
I consulted the intensive care specialist at Ruijin Hospital to see if the mask was fit for medical use. It was only after DOUBLE CHECK that we decided to send Lao Yang back home by air quickly.
我们的功臣老杨口罩回国历经波折没想到困难接踵而来。
Our old minister Yang Mask returned home after ups and downs of difficulties.
1月29日办妥与外商的交易手续后，也就在这一天，前方传来的消息却是德国汉莎航空停飞所有飞往中国的航班。
The day after the deal with foreign businessmen was completed on January 29, the news ahead was that Lufthansa stopped all flights to China.
这一变数使得法兰克福到上海的空运舱位骤减，原先预定2月2日的航班排不上队只能顺延到2月15日，联系其他航空公司得到的反馈也是停飞或少量舱位时间延后的消息。
This variable resulted in a sharp drop in air travel from Frankfurt to Shanghai, with flights originally scheduled for 2 February being rescheduled only up to 15 February, and feedback received from other airlines regarding the suspension of flights or delays in the availability of a limited amount of space.
几经周折，我们得知2月5日有一架航班，货物以“航空快递”的方式出运离港。
After much ado, we learned that there was a flight on Feb. 5, and the goods were shipped out by air courier.
虽然“航空快递”运费比“普通航空运输”贵数倍，但我们班子商讨疫情当下国内急用物资时间拖不得，增加的运费成本就自己承担下来，要尽一切可能将这19万只口罩运回国内，就安排“航空快递”回国。
Although "air courier" than "ordinary air transport," but our team to discuss the outbreak of the current domestic emergency material time, the increase in freight costs to bear their own costs, to do everything possible to transport the 190,000 masks back to the country, and arrange "express delivery by air.
欧洲仓库的口罩真是众志成城天道酬勤，又一个更大的好消息传了过来。
Warehouse masks in Europe are a boon to many, and a bigger piece of good news is coming.
王先生跟外商真切述说了目前中国遭遇了前所未有的疫情和紧缺医疗物资的现状，外商被王先生的爱国之心打动了，愿意将一批90万只口罩平价供给中方。
Mr. Wang and foreign businessmen have truly recounted the current situation of unprecedented epidemic situation and shortage of medical materials in China. Foreign businesses, moved by Mr. Wang's patriotism, are willing to supply China with a batch of 900,000 masks at affordable prices.
这个数目让进出口公司上下大为振奋，但鉴于90万只口罩的货量太大加上第一批口罩曲折的运输经过，公司暂时还不敢直接下单。
That's a big boost for importing and exporting companies, but given the sheer volume of 900,000 masks and the tortuous transportation of the first batch of masks, the company is hesitant to place orders directly.
老杨委托王先生竭尽全力先与供应商商量，锁定住这批口罩。
Lao Yang commissioned Mr. Wang to make every effort to first consult with the supplier, locking these masks.
因为当时我们正焦急紧张地等待另一个重要消息——北京时间1月31日凌晨，世界卫生组织宣布新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情构成“国际关注的突发公共事件”。
In the early morning hours of January 31, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that pneumonia, a new coronavirus infection, constituted a "public emergency of international concern."
这个信息让我们班子喜忧参半，喜的是世界卫生组织没有向中国投“一票否决”限制通商贸易，忧的是将有更多的全球航班受此影响停航中国，此外欧洲各国是否会将医用口罩作为战略储备物资限制出口，也成了未知。
The message is mixed, with the World Health Organization (WHO) not voting "no" to China to restrict trade, worrying that more global flights will be suspended, and whether European countries will restrict exports of medical masks as strategic reserves.
消息出来后，我们班子当机立断，只要有一丝希望就要不惜一切代价将90万只口罩从欧洲运回来，一场和时间的赛跑就此鸣枪。
After the news came out, our team made a quick decision to take 900,000 masks back from Europe at all costs as long as there was a glimmer of hope, and a race against time was fired.
2月1日公司与外商确定下单锁定90万只口罩。
Feb. 1, the company and foreign investors to lock down the order of 900,000 masks.
2月2日和2月3日货物在外商仓库打包备货待运。
The goods were packed and ready for shipment at the foreign warehouse on February 2 and February 3.
接下来的难题就是这批90万只口罩体积太大，直观地说，相当于塞满四十尺集装箱加上大半个二十尺集装箱，疫情期很少有一架飞机有那么大的多余舱位，回国之路可以说是一波三折。
The next challenge is that the 900,000 face masks are so bulky that, intuitively speaking, they are equivalent to 40-foot containers plus half a twenty-foot container. Very few aircraft have that much extra space during an epidemic, and the journey home can be described as a bumpy ride home.
在联系多家航空公司客机没有大舱位后，我们赶紧寻找货机舱位，因为当时飞往中国的航线越来越少了，当时我们甚至有包机回国的打算。
After connecting to several airlines passenger planes did not have the space, we hurried to find cargo space, because the flight to China was less and less, even at that time we have the intention of charter flight home.
经过多方努力，我们在距离法兰克福400公里的荷兰阿姆斯特丹找到了直达上海的货机舱位，可是当我们的货车一路颠簸在2月5日运抵荷兰阿姆斯特丹机场的时候，收到通知原定当天起飞航班被取消了。
After much effort, we found a non-stop cargo plane in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, 400 kilometers from Frankfurt, but when our van jolted all the way to Amsterdam airport in the Netherlands on February 5, the scheduled departure date was cancelled.
滞留在机场仓库的口罩下一步要怎么走？正当我们想尽一切办法与机场交涉的同时，第一批19万只口罩飞离德国法兰克福并在2月6日抵达上海。
Just as we were doing everything we could to deal with the airport, the first batch of 190,000 masks left Frankfurt, Germany, and arrived in Shanghai on February 6.
此时，进出口公司上下一片繁忙，一组员工提前联系上海市商务委和上海市医疗器械检测所，办好防疫物资快速通关手续；一组员工处理第一批口罩现场运抵后的现场医疗检测和仓储搬运；还有一组联系各家航空公司解决滞留在阿姆斯特丹机场的货物空运难题。
A group of employees contacted the Shanghai Commerce Commission and the Shanghai Medical Device Inspection Office ahead of time to complete the fast-track customs clearance of epidemic prevention materials; a group of employees handled the on-site medical examination and warehousing of the first batch of masks on the spot; and a group of airlines to solve cargo airfreight problems stranded at Amsterdam airport.
事关紧急，集团领导也想尽办法与国内各家航空公司联系航班，终因种种缘由无果。
As a matter of urgency, the leaders of the Group also tried to contact domestic airlines by all means, ultimately for various reasons without success.
正当我们焦灼地想着各种办法时，前方的老杨接到了一个意外的电话，2月5日取消航班的那家航空公司，打算在2月9日新增一架次航班中转莫斯科后抵达上海。
As we frantically tried to figure out what to do, Lao Yang in front of us received an unexpected call. The airline that canceled the flight on February 5 intended to arrive in Shanghai on February 9 with an additional flight transiting Moscow.
这对于进出口公司而言简直天降喜讯，我们班子下定决心，无论如何要赶上这班飞机。
It was a good news for the import and export company. Our team decided to catch the plane anyway.
结果大家也知道了，这90万只口罩终于在2月7日在阿姆斯特丹上了货机，通过转运到法兰克福，最后在2月10日在莫斯科上了飞往上海的航班。
As you know, the 900,000 masks landed on a cargo plane in Amsterdam on February 7, crossed over to Frankfurt, and finally flew to Shanghai in Moscow on February 10.
当2月11日凌晨2点飞机抵达浦东机场时，我们公司所有人的心终于定了。
When the plane arrived at Pudong Airport at 2 a.m. on Feb. 11, the hearts of all of us were finally settled.
医疗物资抵达后，我们忙着供给上海商委指定的医药公司，忙着捐赠给武汉和上海抗击新冠病毒的医院和医护人员，忙着供给公安、交运、通信、能源等为本市抗疫工作提供保障服务的企事业单位，也为德籍华人王先生完成了他家乡医院的捐赠。
After the arrival of the medical supplies, we were busy supplying the pharmaceutical companies designated by the Shanghai Mercantile Commission, busily donating to hospitals and medical staff of Wuhan and Shanghai to fight the new crown virus, and busy providing public security, delivery, communications, energy and other enterprises and institutions to provide services to fight epidemic diseases in this city.
Play东方卫视对我们的相关报道在这一阶段的工作中，我特别感谢我们各个工作小组的同事以及我们的业务经理杨聿扬，他们常常半夜还在和海外联系沟通，一次次在希望中等待着音讯，为了这批物资的航班辗转反侧，在疫情期间毅然走出安全港湾奔赴上海商委、机场、海关、仓库、医院、办公室和各大企事业单位现场。
In this stage of our work, I am particularly grateful to my colleagues on various working groups and our sales manager, Pei Yang. They often communicate with overseas and wait for news time and again in the middle of the night.
他们，是一群默默无闻的国企员工，面对疫情，他们选择义无反顾冲上前，为这场没有硝烟的战争贡献自己的力量，我深受感动和鼓舞。
They are a group of anonymous state-owned enterprise employees, in the face of the epidemic, they choose to go forward, for the smoke-free war to contribute their own strength, I am deeply moved and encouraged.
国企要有担当就要有人有作为！现在这批口罩已经到货了，但我们仍然在海外寻找着合适的采购机会——随着各地的口罩厂复工，我们相信口罩的供应会逐渐满足大家的需求，但其他方面的医疗物资，比如防护服之类的，我觉得我们还可以再努力。
Now that the masks have arrived, we are still looking overseas for the right opportunities - we believe the supply of masks will gradually meet our needs as mask factories reopen around the world, but I think we can do more with other medical supplies, such as protective clothing.
医护人员冲锋在一线有需要，我们国企和其他企业就要一起做好后勤保障工作，挑起企业抗击疫情的责任担当，相信众志成城、共克时艰不是一句空话，大家一起努力，疫情终将过去，一切都会好起来。
Our state-owned enterprises and other enterprises should do a good job in logistics support together, instigate enterprises to bear the responsibility of fighting the epidemic. We believe that this will not be an empty word. We will work together, the epidemic will be over and everything will be fine.
