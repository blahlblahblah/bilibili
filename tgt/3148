既要严防死守又要抓紧复工共克时艰，都不能当“铁公鸡”文/闫肖锋发于2020.3.9总第938期《中国新闻周刊》新冠病毒这么一扫，先是零售业、餐饮业、旅游业，现在轮到制造业扛不住了。
We should not be a "Iron Rooster" writer / Yan-young-feng in the 2020.3.9 issue of China News Weekly's new crown virus. Retail trade, catering, tourism, and now the manufacturing industry can't carry it.
“中国制造”乃立国之本，如果都不事生产、生产了也运不出来，那才是比疫情更大的国难。
"Made in China" is the basis of the founding of the country, if no production, production can not be out, it is a greater national tragedy than the epidemic.
这两天华尔街股市暴跌，中国概念股领跌。
Wall Street has slumped over the past two days, led by Chinese stocks.
这是中国经济的“至暗时刻”。
This is the "darkest moment" for China's economy.
“一季度我准备赔上100万。
"I'm going to pay a million a quarter.
”说这话是我的一位老板朋友，拥有一家食品加工的中小企业。
"That's what one of my boss's friends, a small and medium-sized food processor, says.
截至2月25日，他的企业复工率达到了三四成，在所在行业里算是不错的。
As of Feb. 25, he had a return to work rate of 30-40%, which is good in his industry.
他不担心自己的企业会被淘汰，担心的是现在从副总往下到员工，都不跟他站在同一个利益阵营里。
He is not worried about his business going out of business, but about not being in the same league of interests now, from the vice-president down to the staff.
副总们要待遇，员工们要工资；同时政府的税收和社保还得照交。
Vice-presidents get paid, employees get paid, and the government pays taxes and social security.
各方面分文不能少。
Nothing is missing from all sides.
这让他怎么弄？老板们当下的困扰不只是大家不一条心，还有招工难。
How does that make him? Bosses are having trouble not just with people, but also with the job market.
郑州富士康六七万规模的工人数量，现在只到岗5000多人。
The number of workers in Foxconn, Zhengzhou, now stands at more than 5,000.
工人们一是根本就出不来，到了以后也要被隔离14天；二是担心被染上，一旦被染上，那可是一个家庭的灾难。
The workers, who could not get out at all, were to be quarantined for fourteen days; and the fear of being infected, if infected, was a disaster for the family.
食堂吃饭被传染，宿舍睡觉被传染，那可不得了。
Dining in the canteen is contagious and sleeping in the dorm is contagious.
那可就是“钻石公主”号邮轮模式了，全封闭，高传染。
That's the "Diamond Princess" cruise mode. It's completely closed and highly contagious.
我看到华为员工食堂都是拿套餐，每个人躲到一边儿悄悄吃，再也没有了往日的热闹场面。
I saw the Huawei staff canteen is to take the set meal, everyone is hiding away to eat quietly, no longer the old lively scene.
对此，我的这位老板朋友的做法是隔离所有复工的工人，都不许回家，在工厂里吃饭、工作、睡觉，一旦发现问题可以及时处理。
To this, my boss friend's practice is to isolate all workers who return to work, are not allowed to go home, eat, work, sleep in the factory, and when problems are discovered, they can be dealt with in a timely manner.
因为一旦暴发疫情，所有的费用都是由老板来负担的，政府不会负担。
Because in the event of an outbreak, all the costs will be borne by the boss, the government will not bear.
另外一个办法就是分期分时复工，上班的拿工资，待岗的拿生活费。
Another way is to split the time back to work, the wages of the workers, waiting to receive living expenses.
生活费即当地最低工资的80％，现在有政府文件背书了。
The cost of living, which is 80 per cent of the local minimum wage, is now endorsed in government documents.
该老板说，一般企业也不愿意裁员，裁也是不得以，因为一旦裁了就可能招不到人，所以最好的办法就是发生活费先养着。
The average business isn't willing to lay off workers, and layoffs aren't a option, the boss says, because once a layoff occurs, it's best to pay the cost of living first.
共克时艰需要的是大家共同努力，谁当铁公鸡都不应该。
What is needed to overcome difficulties together is the common efforts of everyone, who should not be the iron rooster.
企业倒下了，员工们得再找工作，政府也没了税收。
Businesses collapsed, employees had to find work again, and the government lost taxes.
大家不能只喊“加油”而不行动。
We cannot just shout "cheer" and not act.
共度时艰的大头还是在政府。
It is the government that makes the hard times.
宏观层面，我们乐见各级政府对中小微企业伸出援手。
At the macro level, we are delighted to see governments at all levels helping MSMEs.
各地方纷纷推出“暖企”政策，除了减税减费、缓缴社保外，北上广深等城市反应迅速，出台了一系列扶持政策。
All over the world, there have been various policies aimed at "warming enterprises." In addition to tax cuts and social security payments, cities such as Shang-guang and Shenzhen have responded rapidly, and have introduced a series of supportive policies.
但还是复工难！某地复工要交21份材料。
But it's hard to get back to work! There are 21 materials to be handed over.
人民日报出来说话了：帮把手，别乱伸手。
The People's Daily came out and said, Help the handle.
而浙江等地为了帮企业复工，政府部门出钱包机、包车、包高铁接回外地务工人员，不仅资助吃住、送口罩，还发生活补贴。
Zhejiang and other places to help enterprises return to work, government-funded charter, chartered cars, high-speed rail back to foreign workers, not only to subsidise food, housing, delivery of masks, but also to pay subsistence allowances.
两相对比，施政水平可谓高下有别。
In contrast, the level of governance is different.
当然，地方政府担心复工风险是有道理的。
Of course, local governments are right to worry about the risks of returning to work.
截至2月底，仅广东就有1000万员工尚未返岗。
By the end of February, Guangdong alone had 10 million employees who had not returned to work.
据不完全统计，广东复工后发生的聚集性疫情12起，15人确诊，514人以上被隔离。
According to incomplete statistics, Guangdong resumed work after 12 cases of concentrated epidemic, 15 people confirmed, more than 514 people were isolated.
有的地方一旦工厂和写字楼发生疫情就封厂封楼，损失由商家承担，相关官员可能被免职。
In some places, factories and offices are shut down in the event of an outbreak of disease, losses are borne by businesses and officials may be dismissed.
既要严防死守又要抓紧复工，这看似两相矛盾的指令现在就摆在了地方官员面前。
The seemingly contradictory directives are now before local officials to guard against death and to get back to work.
我这位老板朋友说，他特别能体谅政府的难处。
My boss friend said that he was particularly considerate of the difficulties of the government.
中央压地方，地方官员当然就要压企业，可企业老板去压谁呢？这就是他们这些老板们的疫情困扰。
Central pressure, local officials of course have to suppress the enterprise, but the boss to suppress who? That is their boss's epidemic.
“关了吧！要么炒房，要么炒股。
"Shut it down! Fried houses or stocks.
” 这当然是风凉话。
"That's cool, of course.
对于今年一季度的生产损失，于建嵘在微博上提出，政府负担三分之一，企业负担三分之一，员工也要负担三分之一。
For the first quarter of this year's production losses, Yu Jiangrong on Weibo, one-third of the government, one-third of the enterprises, staff will also bear one-third.
我点评到，共克时艰，企业、员工、国家三三开来分担损失既现实也必需，因为大家要明白，企业没了大家都得喝西北风。
I remarked that it is both realistic and necessary for businesses, employees and countries to share losses together in the face of difficult times, because we need to understand that everyone has to drink the northwest wind.
