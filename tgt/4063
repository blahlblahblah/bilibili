在疫情爆发前，澳大利亚人宁愿用贵一点的本国厕纸，也不会考虑中国品牌的。
Before the outbreak, Australians preferred to use more expensive national toilet paper than consider Chinese brands.
文 | 张惠南我是上海人，在澳大利亚墨尔本定居已经一年了，经营着当地一家有着二十年历史的社区便利店。
Zhang Huinan, a Shanghai resident who has lived in Melbourne, Australia for a year, runs a 20-year-old community convenience store.
每天都和客人聊聊天，喝喝茶，看看报纸，下午打打球、跑跑步，日子过得安静、惬意。
Every day and guests chat, drink tea, read the newspaper, afternoon play ball, run, the day passed quietly, agreeable.
不承想，原本平静日子被突如其来的这场新冠疫情打破了。
Unexpectedly, the calm days were shattered by the sudden outbreak of the new crown.
疫情初期，华人纷纷买口罩寄回国从1月初偶尔看到武汉的相关信息到1月23日武汉宣布封城，这段时间主要的消息来源于微信朋友圈和各个群，澳大利亚媒体鲜有报道。
During the early days of the epidemic, Chinese bought masks and sent them back to China. From the beginning of January, when Wuhan announced the closure of Wuhan in early January, the main news came from micro-trust circles and various groups, which received little coverage in the Australian media.
我的注意力主要集中在国内的疫情发展上了，关注疫情发展，关注物资紧缺。
My attention has been focused on the development of the epidemic in the country, the development of the epidemic, the shortage of supplies.
当听说国内的防护物资开始紧缺的时候，我开始去澳大利亚各大药房采购口罩，支援国内，同时联系国内的朋友想办法找一些口罩、防护服的资源，供应给家人和朋友。
When I heard about the shortage of protective equipment at home, I began to buy masks in major pharmacies in Australia to support the country, and to contact friends at home to find resources for masks and protective clothing for family and friends.
但是很遗憾两条路都走得很艰难。
But it is a pity that both roads have been difficult.
澳大利亚药店的口罩资源似乎非常少，仅有的一些华人就全部买光了，很快所有的大型连锁药店口罩都卖光了。
Australia's pharmacies seem to have very few surgical masks, and some of the few Chinese are out of business. Soon all the big chain pharmacies sold out.
营业员和你说这sorry的同时，看她们眼神就知道，这个事情离澳大利亚还远着呢。
The salesperson told you about the sorry and looked in their eyes and saw that it was far from Australia.
国外网上口罩的价格也突然暴涨，3M公司的N95的防护口罩甚至要价上百澳元一个。
Prices for foreign online masks have also skyrocketed, with 3M's N95 respirators charging as much as A $100 each.
最后还是通过日本的朋友组织了一批口罩做了定向的捐赠并为家人邮寄了一些，心中稍微得到一点安慰。
Finally, it was a little comforting to have friends in Japan organize a group of masks for targeted donations and post some to their families.
当地媒体报道纷纷转向武汉封城之前，澳大利亚媒体对疫情都没有进行大规模的报道，还都集中在伊美之间的摩擦，谈论都是战争对澳大利亚可能带来的影响。
Before local media reports turned to Wuhan, the Australian media had not reported the outbreak on a large scale and had focused on the friction between the US and Iraq over the possible impact of the war on Australia.
从1月23日武汉宣布封城起，澳大利亚媒体开始集中报道新冠肺炎在中国的暴发情况，其中主要内容是针对武汉市民的发病以及中国政府在这场疫情中的各种处理措施。
Since the city was declared closed on January 23 in Wuhan, Australian media have focused on the outbreak of pneumonia in China, focusing on the outbreak of the disease in Wuhan and measures taken by the Chinese government to deal with it.
个人感觉，大多数的报道还是比较客观、中性的，大部分数据都是采用的中国官方发布的数据，而不是像很多网络自媒体那样，发布一些来源不是特别可靠的数据。
Personally, most of the coverage is objective and neutral, with most of the data based on official Chinese data, rather than some sources that are not particularly reliable, as many networks have done since the media.
2月5日以后，很多澳大利亚媒体开设专版，集中报道新冠病毒在全球的影响，也有很多新冠病毒预防的科普文章出现。
Since February 5, many Australian media outlets have run special editions focusing on the global impact of the new crown virus, and many popular science articles have appeared on the subject.
同时，政府也开始采取了一定的措施，比如在机场对有湖北经历史的人员开展体温检测，并要求自我隔离。
At the same time, the government began to take some measures, such as at the airport to have the history of Hubei temperature testing, and asked for self-isolation.
政府禁止入境的国家名单也愈来愈长——2月1日禁止中国旅行史的人员入境，2月29日开始禁止从伊朗来的人员入境、3月5日开始禁止韩国来的人员入境，3月11日开始禁止从意大利来的人员入境……人人都在囤厕纸由于经营小店，我需要对澳大利亚百姓的生活了解更多，所以关注他们的日常生活，也经常和客人聊天，久而久之不少成为了好朋友。
The list of countries where the government has banned entry is also lengthening - people with a history of Chinese travel were banned on Feb. 1, people from Iran were banned from entering the country on February 29, people from South Korea were banned from entering the country on March 11.
我经常会收到他们送来的贺卡、花以及在家里种的瓜果、蔬菜等等。
I often receive cards, flowers and melons and vegetables grown at home.
但是这次疫情的出现，有一个问题一直困扰着我，那就是“囤厕纸”。
But this outbreak, there is a problem that has been troubling me, that is, "toilet paper," according to the source.
大概在2月底，就有人开始抢购厕纸，一开始仅仅抢购打折的厕纸，几乎所有的大型超市，打折的厕纸一抢而空。
Around the end of February, people snapped up toilet paper, initially just to snag discounted toilet paper, and in almost all large supermarkets, discounted toilet paper was snapped up.
接下来的几天时间，只要是厕纸，就开始抢购，导致所有的超市Toilet Paper货架一直处于空置状态。
For the next few days, as long as it was toilet paper, I snapped it up, leaving all the supermarket shelves empty.
在网络上也传出了两个为了争抢厕纸打架的视频。
Two videos of fights over toilet paper were also posted on the Internet.
每天早上7点钟，在大型超市Costco门前，排起了几公里的长队；在批发商的仓库里，厕纸也是空空如也。
Every morning at seven o'clock, in front of Costco, a large supermarket, there are long queues of kilometers; in the wholesaler's storehouse, toilet paper is empty.
这种状况已经持续了两周左右的时间。
This has been going on for about two weeks.
厕纸的生产商都是澳大利亚本地企业，而且厕纸的原材料也不需要从其他国家进口。
Toilet paper is produced by local Australian companies and toilet paper is not imported from other countries.
不知道是生产商的产能不够还是物流企业的运输能力问题，总之很多人买不到厕纸。
I don't know if the production capacity of manufacturers or logistics enterprises transport problems, in a word, many people can not buy toilet paper.
我店里的不少客户一开始认为抢厕纸的人是疯了，为什么要抢购厕纸？但是接下来的时间，他们也开始加入抢购厕纸的队伍了。
Many of my customers started thinking that the toilet paper man was crazy, so why rush for toilet paper? But over the next few days, they joined the rush for toilet paper.
我的小店大包厕纸一天内全部被卖光，只剩下小包装的。
All the toilet paper in my store was sold out in a day, leaving only the small ones.
我不得不开始实行限购，每个客人只能一次买一包，以备急需。
I had to start a sales restriction, each guest can only buy a bag at a time, in case of urgent need.
所以感叹在资源匮乏面前，不要指望人有高素质。
So lament in the face of the scarcity of resources, do not expect high-quality people.
网络上、电视里、电台中都把抢厕纸作为一种嘲讽的对象。
Looting toilet paper is a mockery on the Internet, on television and on the radio.
我现在和澳大利亚华人一起从中国团购厕纸到澳大利亚，海运大概15天就能到。
I am now buying toilet paper from China to Australia with Chinese Australians. Shipping will be possible in about 15 days.
算上运费等各种费用，国内厕纸仍比澳大利亚便宜。
Domestic toilet paper is still cheaper than in Australia, including freight and other charges.
我这几天把中国的厕纸放在小店里免费给顾客试用，大家觉得价廉物美，也不断感谢我。
I have put Chinese toilet paper in the store for free to customers for trial these days. People think it's cheap and nice, and thank me all the time.
而在疫情暴发前，澳大利亚人宁愿用贵一点的本国厕纸，也不会考虑中国品牌的。
Before the outbreak, Australians preferred to use more expensive national toilet paper than to consider Chinese brands.
随着疫情的不断严重，澳大利亚的输入性病例越来越多，总理也发表了关于囤够药品和食品的言论，以应对新冠病毒大流行的问题。
As the epidemic continues to intensify, Australia is experiencing an increasing number of imported cases, and the Prime Minister has made statements about the availability of medicines and food in response to the New Crown Virus pandemic.
民众开始抢购越来越多的物资，包括意面、方便面、大米、糖、常温牛奶等等。
People are snapping up more and more supplies, including spaghetti, instant noodles, rice, sugar, ambient milk and so on.
不爱戴口罩对于戴口罩，澳大利亚人和中国人的观念截然不同。
Don't Love Masks Australians and Chinese have very different ideas about wearing masks.
首先商店里都买不到口罩。
First, there are no masks available in the shops.
前面提到，第一原本储量就不大，第二前一阶段华人疯狂采购，或寄回国内，或自备。
As mentioned earlier, the first reserve is small, the second phase of Chinese shopping frenzy, either sent back home, or their own.
其次，除了东亚人（主要是中、日、韩三国），其他地区的人都没有戴口罩的习惯。
Second, with the exception of the East Asians (mainly in China, Japan, and South Korea), people elsewhere are not in the habit of wearing masks.
我的客人告诉我，他们普遍认为戴口罩是一个人生病了，他可能会流鼻涕、打喷嚏，这时候需要戴上口罩，防止影响到其他人，或者影响环境。
My guests told me that they generally think wearing a mask is a person who is sick, he may have a runny nose, sneeze, need to wear a mask at this time to prevent other people from being affected, or affect the environment.
但是这样的人应该尽量避免去公共场合，包括公共交通、商场等等，应该待在家里或者去医院。
But such people should avoid going to public places, including public transportation, shopping malls, etc., and should stay at home or go to a hospital.
只有在医院，甚至是只有发热门诊、口腔诊所等医疗机构，医生和护士才会被要求戴口罩。
Doctors and nurses are required to wear masks only in hospitals, even in medical institutions such as fever clinics and stomatological clinics.
健康的人出门是不需要戴口罩的，这个可能是他们长久以来形成的观念。
Healthy people don't have to wear masks when they go out, which may be a long-held belief.
3月11日，发热门诊前人们排队检测。
People lined up for tests before the fever clinic on March 11.
在澳大利亚检测新冠病毒是免费的。
Testing for the new crown virus is free in Australia.
所以在3月中旬，大部分的居民出门购物、在Shopping Center并不戴口罩。
So in mid-March, most residents went shopping and did not wear masks at the Shopping Center.
3月15日政府的公告中也没有提及个人应加强防护，包括戴口罩。
There was also no mention in the Government's announcement of 15 March that individuals should strengthen their protection, including wearing face masks.
只是提到了三点：1、洗手；2、打喷嚏用纸遮挡；3、如果有症状，要自我隔离。
Just mention three things: 1) wash your hands; 2) sneeze paper to block; 3) isolate yourself if you have symptoms.
刚开始澳大利亚政府对待新冠病毒的处理方式，重点放在输入性的控制，但是随着输入病例的增多，几场大型活动中都出现了新冠病毒的确诊者，导致了更多人的隔离；两所学校也发现从美国回来的确诊病例，从而在民众中引起一定恐慌。
Initially, the Australian Government's approach to the new Crown virus focused on input control, but as input cases increased, new crown virus diagnostics appeared at several major events, leading to increased isolation; two schools also found confirmed cases from the United States, causing some panic among the population.
一小部分人开始戴上口罩，在检测发热门诊处也开始排起了长队。
A small number of people began wearing masks, and long queues began to form at the testing and heating clinic.
3月13日起，澳大利亚政府宣布取消大型活动，停办2020年的F1墨尔本站的比赛。
On March 13, the Australian government announced the cancellation of major events and the suspension of the F1 Melbourne race in 2020.
同时我家孩子所在的篮球俱乐部也停止了往常每周一次的比赛。
At the same time, my kids' basketball club stopped playing every week.
据了解，应该是所有的比赛包括足球、橄榄球、篮球甚至于网球等俱乐部都停止了周末比赛。
It is understood that all competitions, including football, football, basketball and even tennis, have been suspended for the weekend.
截至3月21日，澳大利亚全国共有新冠肺炎感染确诊病例1051例，包括7个死亡病例。
As of March 21, Australia had 1,051 confirmed cases of New Crown Pneumonia, including seven deaths.
总体来说，澳大利亚人民还是比较安定的。
Overall, the people of Australia are relatively stable.
他们积极面对未来，认为此次疫情只是暂时的，很快就会过去。
They face the future positively, believing that the epidemic is only temporary and will soon pass.
如果政府采取封城的措施，会带来一些生活不便，所以民众会先去超市囤积一些生活必需品。
If the government takes measures to close the city, it will bring some inconvenience, so people will go to the supermarket to hoard some necessities.
