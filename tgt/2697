李起元说，这是他人生经历过最严重的事情了。
'This is the worst thing he has ever experienced in his life, 'Mr. Li said.
“韩国很小，所以平时新闻也不多。
"South Korea is very small, so there's not much news on weekdays.
现在发生了这么大的事，电视里新闻都和这个有关了。
Now that so much has happened, the news on TV has something to do with it.
24小时，全部都是。
24 hours. it's all.
”文| 王仲昀“是的，一切在2月19日之后都变得不一样了。
"Yes, everything has changed since February 19.
19日之前，电视里关于疫情的新闻大多和中国有关；19号之后，电视里中国的新闻都消失了，变成韩国的疫情新闻24小时滚动播出。
Before the 19th, most of the news about the epidemic on TV was related to China; after the 19th, the news of China on TV disappeared, turning into a 24-hour rolling news of the epidemic in South Korea.
”家住首尔附近的安山市民郑巨焕（音）接受《新民周刊》采访时说道。
Zheng Ju-hwan, a resident of Anshan near Seoul, told Xinmin Weekly.
近日，《新民周刊》采访到包括郑巨焕在内的三位韩国市民。
Recently, Xinmin Weekly interviewed three South Korean citizens, including Zheng Ju-hwan.
来自韩国不同城市的他们，介绍了2月下旬以来韩国日益严重的疫情和他们生活的显著的变化。
From different cities in South Korea, they described the growing epidemic in South Korea since late February and the dramatic changes in their lives.
韩国大邱很多商店已经关闭据韩联社消息，韩国中央防疫对策本部3月4日通报，截至当天0时，韩国较3日0时新增516例新冠肺炎确诊病例，累计确诊5328例。
A total of 5,328 new cases of pneumonia have been confirmed in South Korea since 0000 hours on Wednesday, the ministry said on Monday.
自2月19日“新天地”大邱教会引起“超级传播事件”后，韩国成为目前除了中国外疫情最严重国家。
South Korea has been the worst-affected country outside China since February 19, when the Taegu church in Xintiandi triggered a "super-epidemic."
3月3日，首尔汝矣岛LG集团单位食堂，餐桌上立起预防新冠病毒的隔离挡板 图 │ 韩联社济州岛，如今空无一人家住济州岛济州市的尹涤说，过去一年，每当中国放假时，济州市到处可见中国游客。
In Yeouido, Seoul, on March 3, during the past year, when China was on holiday, Chinese tourists were everywhere in Jeju City, said Yin polyester, who lives on the island of Jeju, where no one lives.
街上的银行、免税商店、餐馆，挤满了中国人。
Banks, duty-free shops and restaurants on the streets are crowded with Chinese.
但是从今年1月底到现在，游客越来越少。
But since the end of January there have been fewer and fewer tourists.
眼见没有生意，很多商店关门，街道上常常出现空无一人的景象。
There was no business, many shops were closed, and the streets were often empty.
考虑到中国的春节假期原本应该是济州岛一年中最热闹的时节，这更令人唏嘘。
Given that China's Spring Festival was supposed to be the busiest part of the year on Jeju Island, that's all the more sob.
由于地理上与中国近在咫尺，加上对中国游客的免签政策，济州岛在过去多年里一直深受中国游客青睐。
Geographically close to China, Jeju Island has been a favorite of Chinese tourists for years, thanks to its proximity to China and its visa-free policy for Chinese tourists.
但从2月4日开始，韩国政府暂停了济州岛对中国游客的免签。
But since February 4, the South Korean government has suspended visa-free access to Jeju Island for Chinese tourists.
2月19日疫情在韩国暴发后，韩国本国游客也很少有人到济州岛度假。
Few South Korean tourists also took vacations on Jeju Island after the February 19 outbreak in South Korea.
尹涤是一名朝鲜族中国人，数年前来济州市定居。
Yin polyester is a Korean Chinese who settled in Jeju City several years ago.
她告诉《新民周刊》，对于常住人口只有60万、极为依赖旅游业收入的济州岛而言，因为旅游业几乎停滞，本地人受到了很大 的影响。
She told People magazine that Jeju, with a resident population of only 600,000 and heavily dependent on tourism revenues, was badly affected by the near stagnation of tourism.
“前几年‘萨德’事件发生后，来济州岛旅游的中国人曾大量减少。
"After the Thad incident a few years ago, the number of Chinese who came to Jeju Island to visit was drastically reduced.
后来本地政府推出了一些政策，中国游客又慢慢多了起来。
Then the local government introduced some policies, and Chinese tourists slowly began to grow.
但是现在，有一种一切回到了原地的感觉。
But now, there is a feeling that everything has come back to where it was.
”济州市空荡荡的街道 图 │ 尹涤企业未停工，上班戴口罩关门的不只是济州岛大大小小的商店，还有韩国其他地区各种公众场合。
Jeju City's empty street map 146 Yin polyester business has not stopped, not only Jeju Island large and small shops, but also various public places in the rest of Korea wearing masks.
家住水原市的李起元（音）告诉《新民周刊》，最近半个月，水原多家超市卖场、KTV等娱乐场所因为疫情而不得不关闭。
Li Qiyuan, who lives in Suwon City, told Xinmin Weekly that in the past half month, many supermarkets, KTV and other entertainment venues in Shuiyuan have had to close because of the epidemic.
“在韩国，大概从2月底开始，政府就规定像超市或者KTV这种公众场所，凡是确诊病例在近期有去过的地方，都会关闭。
"In South Korea, from about the end of February, the government has required public places like supermarkets or KTV to close down any confirmed cases that have been visited in the recent past.
最近，一旦本地有新的确诊病例出现，我们市民会收到政府发的短信，短信会告诉我们这个病例最近和他身边的人去过哪些地方，哪些地方已经因此被关闭，以及提醒我们不要再去这些场所。
Recently, once a new case is confirmed in Hong Kong, we will receive a text message from the Government telling us where the case was recently taken and where it has been closed with the people close to him, as well as cautioning us not to go back to these places.
”李起元说道。
"said Li.
据他回忆，水原当地已有大型乐天超市因此关门。
Suwon, he recalls, had already closed its large Rakuten supermarket.
“政府在新闻里表示，最近两周内能够控制疫情。
"The government has said in the news that it will be able to contain the outbreak in the next two weeks.
我们当然希望这样，但还是有点担心的，特别是2月19日之后。
We certainly hope so, but there is some concern, especially after 19 February.
SARS，MERS，我们在韩国都遇到了，都比不上这次严重。
SARS, MERS, we've had it all in South Korea, and it's not as bad as this one.
”李起元说，这是他人生经历过最严重的事情了。
'It's the worst thing he's ever experienced, 'Mr. Li says.
“韩国很小，所以平时新闻也不多。
"South Korea is very small, so there's not much news on weekdays.
现在发生了这么大的事，电视里新闻都和这个有关了。
Now that so much has happened, the news on TV has something to do with it.
24小时，全部都是。
24 hours. it's all.
”李起元的妻子是一名出生在中国延边的朝鲜族人，两人结婚后一直在韩国生活。
Li's wife, a North Korean born in Yanbian, China, has been living in South Korea since their marriage.
去年，妻子被所在的韩国公司派往北京工作。
Last year, his wife was sent to work in Beijing by her Korean company.
妻子带着一大一小两个女儿住在北京，李起元的岳父岳母也在北京帮忙照顾孩子。
His mother-in-law and father-in-law are also in Beijing to help take care of the children.
今年2月2日，李起元的妻子按照公司通知回到北京工作。
On February 2 this year, Li's wife returned to Beijing to work as instructed by the company.
由于北京的中小学早已宣布延迟开学，两个女儿便留在了韩国家中。
The two daughters stayed at home after Beijing's primary and secondary schools had already announced delays in opening classes.
启程前，李起元在韩国通过线上线下各种渠道给即将回中国的妻子买了一些口罩，并留了一部分给家中等待开学的女儿们。
Before leaving, Li bought some masks for his future wife in South Korea through various channels online and left some for her daughters at home waiting to start school.
“本来我买口罩都是给妻子还有女儿准备的。
"I used to buy masks for my wife and my daughter.
没想到啊，现在这批留下来的口罩给我用上了。
Unexpectedly, now this batch of left-over mask for me to use.
3月2日，首尔阳川区木洞幸福百货店前，市民们排起长龙购买口罩 图 │ 韩联社李起元向《新民周刊》表示，原本他在家担心去中国工作的妻子，现在变成她在中国担心自己。
In front of Mu Tung Happiness Store in Yangchuan District, Seoul March 2, citizens lined up to buy masks. Lee Kye-won, a Korean affiliate, told Xinmin Weekly that his wife, who was worried about going to China to work, had become worried about herself in China.
“我和我妻子现在每天都会视频。
"My wife and I now play video every day.
她现在在中国，很想念女儿。
She is in China now and misses her daughter very much.
2月19日之前，我在电话里总是跟她说，要多注意安全，要保重。
Before Feb. 19, I always told her on the phone to be safe and take care of yourself.
19日之后，情况反过来了，变成她每天提醒我，出门一定要戴口罩啊！”和绝大部分韩国公司一样，李起元所在的汽车配件出口包装公司并没有因疫情而停工停产。
After the 19th, the situation turned out to be a daily reminder that you must wear a mask when you go out! "Like most Korean companies, Li's auto parts export and packaging company did not shut down due to the epidemic.
他每天依旧正常上下班，唯一不同的是大家都戴上了口罩。
He continued to commute normally, except that everyone wore masks.
“之前女儿一直和妈妈生活在一起，现在她们已经和我在一起多待了一个多月了。
"My daughter used to live with my mother, and now they've been with me for over a month.
我每天要给她们做早饭和晚饭，午饭她们就得自己解决。
I make breakfast and supper for them every day, and they have to fix it for themselves at lunch time.
”每人每次限购5只口罩1月下旬，当新冠肺炎疫情在中国暴发时，韩国民众普遍认为这件事最终会在中国结束，离韩国还很遥远。
When the outbreak of SARS broke out in China in late January, South Koreans generally thought the case would eventually end in China, far from South Korea.
至于韩国当时出现少数病例，在他们看来也会在2月内就全部控制住。
As for the small number of cases in South Korea, it seems likely that they will be under full control within the next two months.
但是，此前在中国留学5年的韩国人郑巨焕对情况的估计要严重很多。
But Zheng Ju-hwan, a South Korean who has been studying in China for five years, estimates the situation much more seriously.
郑巨焕说，过去一个月来在韩国买口罩变得越来越难。
'Buying masks in South Korea has become more and more difficult over the past month, 'Mr. Zheng said.
“一开始，大概是1月底，我在安山的药店和超市都能买到口罩，网上也能买到。
"At first, about the end of January, I was able to buy masks at pharmacies and supermarkets in Anshan, as well as online.
慢慢地，网上就没了，药店的口罩变得越来越贵，原来卖500韩元（折合人民币约3元）的口罩，卖到了2500韩元。
Slowly, the Internet disappeared and drugstore masks became more expensive, selling 500 won (about 3 yuan) worth of face masks and 2,500 won.
”郑巨焕向《新民周刊》透露，从3月2日开始，韩国政府已经接管了各地药店的口罩销售。
Mr Cheng told Xinmin Weekly that the government had taken over the sale of face masks in pharmacies around the country since March 2.
政府会定时组织药店售卖口罩，但数量有限，每人每次最多买5只。
Pharmacies are regularly organized to sell face masks, but only in limited quantities, up to a maximum of five per person.
“听中国朋友说，他们之前会在小区统一排队买口罩，或者网上预约去药店买，一次最多买5只。
"According to Chinese friends, they used to queue up for masks in their neighborhoods, or make online appointments to buy up to five at a time.
现在的韩国跟中国，在这一点上很像。
South Korea is much like China at this point.
”3月2日下午，韩国忠清北道清州市上党区龙岩洞，居民扎堆买口罩 图│韩国《中央日报》据韩联社报道，韩国总统文在寅3月3日表示，随着大邱和附近的庆尚北道新冠病毒危机达到“顶峰”，韩国宣布对新冠病毒“作战”，政府所有机构进入24小时全面戒备状态。
South Korean President Wen Jieyin said March 3 that South Korea had declared a "war" on the new crown virus and put all government agencies on 24-hour full alert as Daegu and the nearby Gyeongshan-North Province reached the "peak" of the New Crown Virus crisis in the southern part of the country.
尽管政府宣布大邱和庆北两地区疫情达到“顶峰”，但这个“顶峰”会不会持续下去，又要多久才能够缓和，目前没人能给出定论。
Although the government has declared the Daegu and Gyeongbei regions "peak," no one can say for sure whether or how long this "peak" will last.

相较同时期的日本本土和新加坡，韩国的情况要好一点。
South Korea fared better than its contemporaries, Japan and Singapore.
但是情况在19日急转直下。
But things fell sharply on the 19th.
19日新增20例，20日新增53例，21日100例。
There were 20 new cases on the 19th, 53 new cases on the 20th and 100 cases on the 21st.
15天后，在3月3日已经超过5000例。
Fifteen days later, there were more than 5,000 cases on March 3.
这一切要归咎于2月18日大邱的第31号患者被确诊。
All this was attributed to the diagnosis of patient No. 31 in Daegu on February 18.
这位61岁的女性，2月7日出现症状后，又多次前往教会、医院、酒店等公共场所，直到2月18日才确诊为新冠肺炎。
The 61-year-old woman, who developed symptoms on February 7, went to public places such as churches, hospitals and hotels several times before being diagnosed with pneumonia on February 18.
在此期间，此人曾于2月9日和16日与超过1000名信众一同参与礼拜。
During this period, he attended services with more than 1,000 followers on 9 and 16 February.
随后，她所属的“新天地”大邱教会中开始陆续有人被确诊。
Later, people began to be diagnosed in the Taegu church, where she belongs.
至今为止，韩国的确诊病例中，近六成与该教会有关。
To date, nearly 60 per cent of the confirmed cases in Korea are related to the Church.
