我们做好了奋战半年的打算武汉大学中南医院重症医学科的护理人员。
We have prepared the plan for half a year Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital intensive care staff.
本刊记者/周群峰 摄1月25日，大年初一，“封城”下的武汉，小雨绵绵，路上人车稀少。
This print journalist / Zhou Qunfeng She January 25, New Year's Day, "closed" under Wuhan, light rain, the road is scarce.
但武汉大学中南医院重症医学科（ICU）的医护人员们无暇过年，依旧忙着照顾科室里16名新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎危重症患者。
But doctors and nurses at Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital's intensive care unit (ICU) are still busy caring for 16 patients with severe pneumonia, the latest coronavirus infection.
在该科室一名护士的指导下，《中国新闻周刊》记者花了20多分钟穿上专业的防护装备，包括N95口罩、面屏、头套、手术服、连身式一次性防护服、防护面屏、防护鞋套与两层手套。
Under the guidance of a nurse from the section, China News Weekly reporters spent more than 20 minutes wearing professional protective equipment, including N95 masks, face screens, head coverings, surgical uniforms, disposable overalls, face protection screens, protective shoes and two layers of gloves.
刚穿上这套装备时，人有点憋得喘不过气来。
When I put on this outfit, I was a bit out of breath.
旁边的护士说，他们刚开始穿的时候也是这种感觉，过几天就适应了。
The nurses nearby said they felt the same way at the beginning and got used to it in a few days.
护士长马晶解释说，在此次疫情爆发之前，这些装备连重症医学科的护士也不会用。
Before the outbreak, the equipment could not even be used by nurses in critical medical disciplines, explained Ma Jing, head nurse.
“平常工作时，我们就带个口罩，穿工作服就可以了。
"Normally at work, we just wear a mask and work clothes.
以前也会准备这些装备，但只是每年开箱检查一下，看是不是在有效期之内。
The equipment will be prepared before, but only open the box every year to check if it is within the validity period.
”“一个危重患者转出，三四个患者排队进来”在中南医院ICU病区内，77岁的老太太李阿珍（化名）带着口罩，躺在病床上，看上去，瘦小的身体还是比较虚弱，但是意识很清醒，精神状态还不错。
"One critically ill patient turns out, three or four patients line up." In the ICU ward of Zhongnan Hospital, 77-year-old Li Ah-zhen, a 77-year-old woman wearing a mask, still looks frail but conscious and in good spirits.
护理人员正在为其整理着被褥。
Paramedics are fixing their bedding.
李阿珍说，1月初，她有些咳嗽、发烧，体温升到38.5℃。
In early January, Ms. Li said, she developed a cough, a fever and a temperature of 38.5 degrees Celsius.
因为自己平常很少生病，也没太在意，吃了一个星期的感冒药没见效果，就到附近诊所打了几天吊瓶，仍未退烧，喘气也变得些更加困难。
Because he usually rarely sick, not too much attention, eat a week of cold medicine did not work, then to the nearby clinic for a few days, still fever, panting has become more difficult.
儿女带着她去附近的几家医院救治，都不肯收治。
Her children took her to several nearby hospitals for treatment, but refused to accept treatment.
1月20日，李阿珍被家人送到中南医院，经过诊治，这几天病情已趋于稳定，体温也降到了37℃左右。
On January 20, Li Aizhen was taken by her family to the Zhongnan Hospital, where she was treated and treated.
目前，中南医院正在收治新型冠状病毒感染肺炎危重患者16名，本刊记者正在采访其中一位患者。
At present, Zhongnan Hospital is treating 16 patients with severe pneumonia due to new coronavirus infection. Our correspondent is interviewing one of them.
拍摄者/高光华目前，包括李阿珍在内，中南医院重症医学隔离病房里的16名新冠肺炎危重患者全部都是中老年人。
Photographer / Gao Guanghua At present, including Li Aizhen, the 16 patients in the intensive care isolation ward of Zhongnan Hospital are all elderly and middle-aged.
护士长马晶告诉《中国新闻周刊》，现在床位非常紧张，危重患者每转出去一个，后面就有三四个人排队进来。
The head nurse Ma Jing told China News Weekly that beds are now so tight that three or four people line up behind each turn of a critically ill patient.
目前，该院重症医学科的医护人员实行三班倒，每次值班时，有十几名护理人员、两三名医生。
At present, the hospital's intensive care staff to implement three shifts, each time on duty, a dozen nurses, two or three doctors.
护理人员除了负责为患者喂药，整理被褥等，还要负责病人的吃喝拉撒。
Nursing staff are responsible for feeding, bedding and the like, as well as feeding, drinking and rasa.
武汉新冠肺炎疫情爆发后，一个令人振奋的消息就是从中南医院传出的。
Wuhan after the outbreak of new crown pneumonia, a heartening news is coming from the South China Hospital.
1月22日，中南医院宣布，他们用移动心肺仪（ECMO）成功救治了一名新型冠状病毒患者，属湖北省首例。
On January 22, Zhongnan Hospital announced that it had successfully treated a new coronavirus patient with a mobile cardiopulmonary bypass (ECMO), the first case in Hubei province.
中南医院重症医学科主任彭志勇告诉《中国新闻周刊》，目前，该患者已转入感染科隔离病房，接受进一步治疗。
Peng Zhiyong, director of severe medicine at Zhongnan Hospital, told China News Weekly that the patient had been transferred to the infection ward for further treatment.
但是，他强调说，ECMO属于抢救性措施，并不适合大面积推广应用。
However, he stressed that ECMO is a rescue measure, not suitable for large-scale application.
“该技术在此次疫情中，只应用于危重症患者，是在对患者做了很多尝试都无效的情况下，病人在24小时内可能有生命危险时才用到，目的是保证病人不会因缺氧而死，为进一步治疗留出时间。
"This technique, which is only used in this case in critically ill patients, is only used when many attempts on the patient have failed and the patient may be in danger within 24 hours in order to ensure that the patient does not die from lack of oxygen and to allow time for further treatment.
”该科护士介绍说，针对此次疫情，目前没有特效药，只能对症、支持治疗，“根据患者的血培养、尿培养等结果，来制定治疗方案。
The department's nurses said there were no specific drugs for the outbreak, only symptomatic, supportive treatment, "depending on the results of the patient's blood culture, urine culture, etc., to formulate treatment plans.
”1月23日，武汉市为应对发热病人无序就医可能带来的交叉感染和疾病传播，开始实行发热病人集中就诊的“7+7”模式。
On January 23, Wuhan began implementing the "7 + 7" model for intensive treatment of febrile patients in response to possible cross-infection and spread of the disease as a result of a disorderly medical treatment.
所有体温在37.3度以上的发热病人需先到7家定点的二级公立医院就诊，同时安排了7家三甲医院对口帮扶这7家定点医院。
All febrile patients with a temperature above 37.3 degrees need to visit seven designated level II public hospitals and seven triple-A hospitals have been arranged to assist the seven designated hospitals.
按该模式，中南医院对口帮扶的医院为武汉市第七医院。
According to this model, the hospital in Zhongnan Hospital is the seventh hospital in Wuhan.
中南医院相关负责人告诉《中国新闻周刊》，目前，中南医院已经派出六七名医护人员进入武汉七院帮扶。
At present, the South China Hospital has sent six or seven medical personnel to the seven hospitals in Wuhan to help.
“7+7”模式实行后，除非急诊的病人，中南医院不再收治普通发热的患者。
After the implementation of the "7 + 7" model, unless emergency patients, the South China hospital will no longer treat ordinary patients with fever.
这样能缓解床位紧张问题。
This will alleviate the problem of bed strain.
也能减低交叉感染的风险。
It also reduces the risk of cross-infection.
一名医护人员称，目前武汉七院有300多张床位，但仍满足不了需求。
Wuhan seven hospitals have more than 300 beds, but still can not meet the demand, a medical staff said.
医护人员也是高危人群，有症状也要及时排查。
Health care workers are also high-risk groups, symptoms should also be timely screening.
如果一旦感染后，就会进入专门针对医护人员的病房救治。
If the infection occurs, it will be treated in a hospital room specially designed for medical staff.
比物资紧缺更令人不安的，是医务人员感染疫情爆发后，医疗物资紧缺，让中南医院重症医学科团队有些担心。
More disturbing than the shortage of supplies is the shortage of medical supplies after the outbreak of the outbreak of medical personnel, which caused some concern to the intensive care team of Zhongnan Hospital.
马晶说，“我们的口罩都快弹尽粮绝了，但我还是得必须按时发给护士，全力保障大家的安全。
"Our masks are running out of food and drink, but I still have to send them to the nurses on time to ensure everyone's safety," Ma said.
据介绍，在这里工作，穿上手术服后，必须再穿一身防护服。
According to the introduction, working here, put on surgical clothes, must wear a suit of protective clothing.
还必须带两层防护手套，第一层要确保始终不离手，第二层按需要及时更换。
Two layers of protective gloves must also be worn, the first to ensure that they remain in place and the second to be replaced as needed.
这样一套全身装备大约需要200多元，医护人员穿一次大约也需要20～25分钟。
Such a full-body kit would take about 200 yuan, and it would take about 20 to 25 minutes for a medical worker to wear it.
穿的时候一定得规范，不能着急，因为稍有不慎，就把自己暴露了。
Wear when must standardize, cannot worry, because slightly careless, exposed oneself.
马晶所在的科室，现在保守估计每天也要用100套防护服。
Ma's department now conservatively estimates that it also uses 100 suits a day.
这里的库存能保证用到正月初七左右。
Stock here can be guaranteed until the seventh day of the first month.
有时上级领导来检查工作，都得给他们准备一套。
Sometimes higher leaders come to inspect the work, they have to prepare a set.
所以现在也在尽力节省，前段时间，有记者要过来采访，“为了节约装备，我也只好婉拒。
So I'm trying my best to save money. Some time ago, a reporter came to interview me. "To save equipment, I have to decline.
”按照规定，专业的防护服、口罩等装备按要求4小时更换一次。
Professional protective clothing and masks are required to be replaced every four hours, according to regulations.
马晶要求护士，为减少消耗，工作前要尽量少喝水，否则上一次厕所，就得重新换一次装备。
Ma asked the nurse to drink as little water as possible before work to cut down on consumption. Otherwise, she had to be re-equipped for the last time.
但事实上，在ICU里，护理团队体能消耗很大，又得需要大量补水。
But in fact, in the ICU, the nursing team is physically exhausting and needs a lot of water.
物资短缺也给医护人员带来了恐慌感。
Shortages of supplies have also caused panic among health-care workers.
马晶称，她现在能做的也只能是让同事尽量省着用。
Ma says all she can do now is ask her colleagues to save as much money as possible.
“在新的物资进来之前，我也不知道怎么办。
"I don't know what to do until new supplies come in.
而物资什么时候来，我也不知道。
I don't know when the supplies will come.
”马晶的一个同学在武汉市某周边城市的医院上班。
One of Ma's classmates works at a hospital in a neighboring city in Wuhan.
几天前，这名同学给马晶发微信说：“我们物资更紧缺，我们几个人不得不共用一套防护装备，而且只能优先提供给管理高度疑似病人的医护人员使用。
A few days ago, the classmate wrote to Ma Jingfa: "We are more short of supplies and several of us have to share a set of protective equipment and can only give priority to medical staff who manage highly suspect patients.
”看到这条微信，马晶都要流泪了。
"Ma was about to burst into tears when she saw the letter.
“我们有时候，在穿脱这套装备时，操作稍有不慎，都会造成交叉感染，更何况几人共用一套。
"We sometimes wear this equipment out of care, will cause cross-infection, not to mention a few people share a common set.
”大年初一上午，有朋友给马晶发来春节问候微信时问，医院物资真的像外界说的那么紧缺吗？马晶只回答了两个字“是的”。
On the morning of the Lunar New Year, some friends sent greetings to Ma Jing during the Spring Festival.
在中南医院，重症医学科作为收治危重患者的科室，防护服等物品的供应相对还充足一点。
In the south-central hospital, the severe medical science as a department for the treatment of critically ill patients, the supply of protective clothing and other items is relatively adequate.
其他临床科室则因物资匮乏，加上患者还未确诊，即便医护人员去医院设备处申请，也不一定能得到。
Other clinical departments do not always have access to hospital facilities because of lack of supplies and because patients have not yet been diagnosed.
马晶说，设备处要首先确保重症医学科的需要，但实际上院内其他科室的风险也很大，因为那里也有疑似病例。
Ma said the facility should first ensure the need for critical medical science, but in fact other sections of the compound are also at high risk because of suspected cases there.
中南医院一位负责人告诉《中国新闻周刊》，疫情爆发以来，每天都有全国各地的爱心人士和企业来电，咨询如何捐助。
A director of the South China Hospital told China News Weekly that every day since the outbreak, loving people and businesses from all over the country have called to ask how to donate.
院方对这种善举非常感谢，但并非所有捐赠的物资都能用。
The hospital is very grateful for the kindness, but not all the donated materials can be used.
“医护人员使用的物资，都有严格的国家标准，有些物资即便捐赠过来，医院也未必用得上，还造成资源浪费。
"There are strict national standards for what health-care workers use, and even when donated, hospitals do not necessarily use them and waste resources.
”与工作强度大、医疗物资紧缺相比，医务人员感染才是最让团队不安的因素。
Compared with the intensity of the work and the scarcity of medical supplies, it was the infection of medical staff that was the most disturbing factor.
目前，已有多家医院爆出医护人员感染的案例。
At present, there have been many hospital out of cases of medical staff infection.
马晶说，虽然医护人员保护措施专业，但是长时间超负荷工作，致使身体抵抗力下降，也容易导致自身感染。
Although health care workers are professional in protective measures, working long hours with excessive workload reduces body resistance and can easily lead to self-infection, Ma said.
“不要为我担心”马晶在中南医院ICU已经工作了十余年。
"Don't worry about me" Ma Jing has been working in ICU of Zhongnan Hospital for more than ten years.
科室原共有30名护士，疫情发生后，人手不够，院方从其他病区紧急调配，现在增加到44名。
The department originally had 30 nurses, after the outbreak of the disease, the number of staff, hospital emergency redeployment from other areas, now 44.
然而，马晶说，紧急调配来的护士，没有ICU科室工作经验，“一些专业的护理工作，还是我们在做。
However, Ma said, the emergency dispatch of nurses, no ICU desk work experience, "some professional nursing work, or we are doing.
”疫情爆发之初，马晶每天早上6、7点钟出门上班，晚上10点左右回家。
When the outbreak began, Ms Ma went out to work at 6 or 7 a.m. and came home around 10 p.m.
后来，因担心家中老人和孩子的健康，从1月8日起，她就主动自行“隔离”，住进了医院。
Since January 8, fearing for the health of her elderly and children, she has voluntarily "quarantined" and taken to hospital.
医院负责订饭，住宿就在值班室。
The hospital orders meals and the accommodation is in the duty room.
“我们一线的护士，看到我在这，对他们也是一种鼓励，能够让他们更安心地工作。
"Our front-line nurses, seeing me here, are an encouragement to them to work more confidently.
”长期超负荷的工作，令马晶感到体力透支。
Ma felt physically overstretched after a long period of overwork.
科主任彭志勇担心她抵抗力太差，就把她赶回家休息。
Pang Zhiyong, director of the science department, worried about her poor resistance, drove her home to rest.
可是马晶在家里待了2天后，因病房实在缺人手，又重返工作岗位。
However, Ma Jing stayed at home for 2 days, because the ward is really short of staff, and returned to work.
彭志勇说，疫情发生以来，该科室每人每天工作差不多12个小时。
Peng said the unit had been working about 12 hours a day per person since the outbreak.
现在，该院重症医学科很多医护人员不得不实行“白+夜”的上班制度，即一天只休息8小时，其余时间都上班。
Many staff in the hospital's intensive care unit now have to work on a "white + night" basis, with only eight hours off a day and the rest of the day.
过去，马晶和同事们也经常这样加班，但现在不同的是，需要穿着闷人的防护服长时间工作。
Ma and her colleagues used to work overtime, but now they have to work long hours in stuffy suits.
大年初一早上，马晶给家中7岁的儿子打电话。
On the morning of New Year's Day, Ma called her 7-year-old son.
儿子在电话里哭着说想妈妈，马晶却不知道怎么安慰他。
Her son cried on the phone and said he missed her mother, but Ma did not know how to comfort him.
“以前每年春节也常值班，但是像这样有家不能回，还是第一次。
"Spring Festival used to be on duty every year, but it was the first time there was a home like this.
同事中，有很多人的家人不在武汉，我一家老小虽都在武汉，却也有家不敢回。
Colleagues, many of the family is not in Wuhan, my family and children although all in Wuhan, but there are also home dare not go back.
”马晶说，很多同事有时都说自己不想从事医护工作，只想平平安安上个班，但一旦进入工作岗位，就不会有人逃避。
Ma says many co-workers sometimes say they don't want to take care of themselves, but once in work, no one escapes.
现在没人能预测，这场疫情什么时候结束。
No one can predict when the epidemic will end.
“参考非典持续的时间，我们也做好了与这次疫情奋战半年的打算。
"Taking into account the duration of SARS, we are also ready to fight the epidemic for six months.
”采访时，护士程慧拉着记者合影，做出胜利的姿势。
"During the interview, nurse Emily Cheng took a group photo with the reporter and posed for victory.
她说，“希望这张照片让家人亲友们看到，让他们不要为我担心。
"I hope this photo will be shown to family and friends so they don't worry about me," she said.
