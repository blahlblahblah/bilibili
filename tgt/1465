燃财经（ID:rancaijing）原创作者 | 孔明明编辑 | 周昶帆2月1日，一则关于西贝莜面村（下文简称“西贝”）董事长贾国龙的采访引发广泛关注，在那篇报道中，贾国龙说“公司账面现金流只能维持3个月”。
Former creator and founder of Finance (ID: Rancaijing) & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & nbsp; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & #
2月8日，另一则关于老乡鸡董事长束从轩“手撕员工连名信”的视频再一次引发热议，视频传达的信息是，尽管老乡鸡在疫情期间面临严重亏损，但束从轩依然选择拒绝员工申请无薪工作的请求。
Another video, on Feb. 8, of Hutchison Chicken Chairman beam tearing employees' names from Hutchison, sparked another heated debate, conveying the message that Hutchison had chosen to reject an employee's request for unpaid work despite facing severe losses during the outbreak.
同样是餐饮企业，木屋烧烤的创始人隋政军则选择接受员工从上到下的“半薪”请求，并说，“这次我选择做狗熊，而不是英雄。
In the same restaurant business, Sui Zhengjun, founder of the log cabin barbecue, chose to accept a "half-pay" request from the top down, saying, "This time I chose to be a bear, not a hero.
”作为餐饮行业烧烤细分领域的头部企业，木屋烧烤的员工在2月1日隋政军转发了关于西贝的报道文章后，自发地组织了一场请求“工资减半”的减薪运动，据木屋烧烤发布的匿名调查问卷显示，76%的员工自愿支持这一行动。
As the head of a restaurant barbecue division, wooden shack barbecue employees spontaneously formed a pay cut after transmitting articles about him on Feb. 1, according to anonymous questionnaires from a log cabin barbecue that showed 76 percent of workers volunteered to support the move.
隋政军称，这次疫情的出现对于他们团队也算是好事，因为“团队到现在为止，还没有经历过这种大型危机”，而2016年现金流差点断掉的“生死不如”的经历，曾让隋政军在内心深处深深植入了一种时时关注公司现金流的警惕。
The Sui government said the outbreak was also good for their team, as "the team has not experienced such a major crisis so far" and the 2016 cash flow nearly cut off the "life and death" experience, once deeply embedded in Sui Zhongjun a constant concern about the company's cash flow.
“现金流就相当于一个人的血液，很可怕。
"Cash flow is the equivalent of a person's blood, very terrible.
血液平时看似不重要，流一点血你会觉得无所谓，觉得心脏比血更重要。
Blood does not seem to be important at ordinary times, flow a little blood you will feel indifferent, feel the heart is more important than blood.
但就是看似不重要的血液，如果全部放光，心脏、肝肺再好，还是得死。
But even seemingly unimportant blood, if all the light, the heart, liver and lungs, or die.
”隋政军说。
"said Sui.
疫情突如其来，餐饮业步入至暗时刻。
The epidemic broke out and the catering industry entered a dark hour.
在企业家不同举动背后，其实都只有一个简单目的：“尽一切可能，让公司活下来。
Behind the entrepreneurs' different moves, there is actually only one simple purpose: "to do everything possible to keep the company alive."
”以下为木屋烧烤创始人隋政军自述：一场自上而下的减薪运动公司不是情况特别紧张时，老板不会跟员工讲太多事情。
Here's what the founder of the log cabin barbecue says: A top-down pay-cut exercise company isn't too nervous to tell employees too much.
2月1日，我看到很多人转发西贝莜面村困境的那篇文章，我自己朋友圈转发时写道，“我们在坚持，一天是百万级亏损，西贝是千万级亏损，几个亿最多三个月，但有什么办法，只能扛到最后！”当时我想，西贝作为餐饮行业第二名，贾总在餐饮行业打拼30多年才有今天，连它都有问题，实在太可惜；同时也想到了自己创业不易，心里很难受。
On February 1, I saw a lot of people forwarding naked oats in the direction of Xibei village, and I wrote to my friends as I forwarded it, We are insisting that one day is a million-level loss, Xi bei is a multibillion-dollar loss, hundreds of millions of months at the most!
我想很多同行当时看到这篇文章应该都有类似的感受。
I think a lot of my peers saw that this article was supposed to have similar feelings.
当时高管们都很关注这篇文章，因为他们想西贝都撑不过三个月了，那我们能撑几个月？半个多小时后，我们华北地区财务总监胡玉兰给我发了一条微信说：“需要的话，自愿工资减半”，当时我很感动，随后把这个对话发到了朋友圈。
After more than half an hour, Hu Yulan, our financial director for North China, sent me a message saying, "If necessary, the voluntary salary should be halved." Then I was moved and sent the conversation to a group of friends.
胡玉兰跟隋政军的微信对话来源/隋政军朋友圈最开始转发这个截图，目的不是要让大家去干什么。
Hu Yulan and Sui political and military sources of micro-letter dialogue / Sui Zheng military circle of friends began to forward this screenshot, the purpose is not to let everyone do.
因为胡总在我们公司2003年只有5个人创业时就在，开第一家店时，她就是我们的收银员。
She was our cashier when we opened our first store in 2003, when only five people started a business.
她是一个农村小女孩，小孩才一岁多，正是花钱的时候，父母又都是重庆农村的，年前相继得了重病，家里其实很缺钱。
She is a small rural girl, the child is more than a year old, just when the time to spend money, parents are in Chongqing rural areas, one year ago have been seriously ill, the family is really very short of money.
我也听过其他高管伙伴说，小胡最近日子过得挺难，特别缺钱。
I've also heard from other top executives that Mr. Hu has had a hard time these days, and is particularly short of money.
她收入也不高，不是在一线部门，没什么分红和绩效奖金，实际只有固定工资加奖金，所以在这个时候她主动提出降薪一半，我觉得我们最老的伙伴在关键时候能想到替公司分忧，特别让人感动。
She wasn't earning much, either, not in the front-line department, with no bonuses or performance bonuses, but a fixed salary plus a bonus, so at this point she offered to cut her salary by half.
但我没想到，其他高管团队紧接着都去跟进，他们都说自己实际上也在想这件事，他们也很乐意。
But I didn't expect other senior teams to follow suit, saying they were actually thinking about it, and they were happy.
隋政军朋友圈截图 来源/隋政军朋友圈注：TMT为核心高管团队当时我说没事儿，我想的是不仅仅不减薪，我还准备给员工们提前发春节那段时间的工资。
Sui and Jun Friends Circle www.youtheme.cn www.youtheme.cn / www.youtheme.cn core group of executives I said it was OK, I was thinking not only of not cutting salaries, but of giving my employees an early paycheck for the Spring Festival.
2月2日，核心高管又一次来请示我，我告诉大家：“如果情况再继续恶化，肯定走这一步。
On February 2, core executives came to me again, and I told you, "If things get worse, take this step."
”当时高管们集体表态，如果公司一定要做这件事，愿意发动大家一起参与。
Executives collectively said they were willing to get everyone involved if the company was going to do it.
我当时表态先看一看，等2月15日之后再说。
I said that I would look at it first and wait until after 15 February.
但没想到，2月2日，高管们发起了减薪请愿行动。
But on February 2, executives launched a pay-cut petition.
来自全国各地门店的请愿书 来源 / 受访者本来我不太相信这个东西，我觉得这里边有些人会被道德绑架，我还担心他们会强迫下面人去摁手印，虽然我看到那个东西挺开心，但这到底是不是大家真正愿意做的，这很重要。
I don't think there are people here who will be morally kidnapped, and I'm afraid they will force the following people to press their fingerprints. While I'm happy to see that stuff, it's important that everyone really wants to do it.
我让IT部门做了一个匿名的问卷调查，问卷里面会问你参与这次降薪保岗的同舟共济活动，是属于自愿还是不自愿，是支持不反对还是被胁迫的，或者说就是反对这件事。
I asked the IT department to do an anonymous questionnaire asking if your participation in the campaign was voluntary or involuntary, whether it was no objection or coercion, or whether it was a matter of opposing it.
当时很多高管跟我说，老隋你不能做问卷调查，万一搞出篓子来，这事就搞大了。
At that time, many executives told me that you could not do a questionnaire survey in old Sui, in the event of a basket case, this thing will be big.
但我觉得不这么问一下就接纳了大家的帮助和支持，这是不对的。
But I feel it is wrong to accept your help and support without asking.
我不想当鸵鸟，把脑袋往沙子里面一插，我认为民意就是要大家真正支持你。
I don't want to be an ostrich, put my head in the sand, I think the public opinion is to really support you.
我这个人比较轴，我告诉他们我要搞，哪怕最后搞明白了大家是不同意，那就不搞，就让公司去顶。
I compare shafts, I tell them I want to do it, even if finally understand that people do not agree, then do not do, let the company top.
大家都说患难见真情，在最危难的时候，我想看看大家到底对公司是怎么想的。
We all said the truth, in the most dangerous time, I would like to see what we think of the company.
但谁知道结果特别好，出乎我们所有人的意料，目前我们总共收回接近3000份问卷，其中有76%的员工自愿支持，16%不反对，只有5%的人觉得是被胁迫的，或者说本身就反对这件事。
But who knows that the results were particularly good, to the surprise of all of us, that we have now collected nearly 3,000 questionnaires, of which 76 per cent have volunteered their support, 16 per cent have no objection and only 5 per cent feel coerced or have objected to it themselves.
当时我们自己认为说有20%的自愿就算不错了，如果能有50%的人是不反对的，我们觉得这事就可以接受，因为最起码有一大半人是不反对你的，但没想到是这个样子。
At the time, we thought it would be nice to say 20% volunteer, and if 50% didn't object, we thought it was acceptable, because at least more than half of us didn't object to you, but we didn't expect it.
我真的觉得很欣慰。
I really feel good about it.
“我选择当狗熊，不当英雄”从1月23日武汉宣布封城时，我开始隐约觉得这次疫情有点严重。
"I choose to be a bear, not a hero," I began to feel a little bit more serious when Wuhan announced its closure on January 23.
最开始我觉得这次疫情再严重也不会超过3个月，我又是一个乐天派，当时预估，疫情会在2月9日之前结束。
At first I didn't think the epidemic would take more than three months. I was a optimist again, predicting that the outbreak would end by February 9.
那时我其实不慌，因为我经历过SARS，认为病毒跟季节有关，等到天气变暖，病毒就会消失了。
I wasn't panicking at the time because I had experienced SARS and thought the virus was seasonal and would disappear when the weather got warmer.
但我们整个营业一下子停掉了，从来没遇到过这种情况。
But the whole business was shut down, and we had never seen anything like it.
平时营业额下降百分之五六，我都紧张得不行。
I'm so nervous about losing five or six percent of my usual turnover.
我们每天有报表，看报表是绿的我就受不了，属于下降状态，看到报表都是红的才觉得这个日子过得还算行。
We have a daily report, to see the report is green I can not bear, belongs to the state of decline, to see the report is red only to think that this day passed OK.
现在都不是绿的了，而是悬崖式下跌。
It's not green anymore, it's a cliff.
木屋烧烤的销售额变化 来源 / 受访者整个团队有一定恐慌，对我来说最重要的是让大家稳定情绪。
The source of the barbecue sales / interviewees There was a certain amount of panic in the team. The most important thing for me was to calm everyone down.
第一要对这件事做预判，包括会持续多长时间、影响有多大等，自己要做一个上、中、下的三级判断。
The first is to prejudge the matter, including how long it will last and how much impact it will have, and to make a judgment at the top, middle, and bottom levels.
另外是搞清楚，最重要的是要活下去。
And to make it clear, the most important thing is to live.
我们判断这是突发事件，一定会过去，别在突发事件持续的过程中死掉，要尽可能开源节流。
We judge that this is an emergency, will pass, do not continue to die in the course of emergencies, to make as much money as possible.
经营上要做预判：到底是关店还是继续经营？我们选择了坚持经营。
Business to do a pre-judgement: whether to close shop or continue to operate? We chose to adhere to the operation.
我当时原则有两条：第一是无条件服从政府安排，配合政府做好防疫工作；第二是一定坚持经营，除非政府要求停。
My principles were twofold: first, to comply unconditionally with government arrangements and to cooperate with the government in carrying out epidemic prevention work; and secondly, to insist on doing business unless the government asks for a halt.
很多餐饮品牌都说他们停业至1月30号，我当时就说他们1月30号肯定恢复不了营业，因为只要停业了，什么时候恢复就不知道了。
Many restaurant brands said they were out of business until January 30, when I said they would definitely not be able to resume business on January 30th, because once the shutdown is over, when will it be resumed?
后来证明我是对的，那些品牌他们从当时说的1月30号改到2月9号，2月9号依然开不了，又得往后延，而且现在都不给具体时间了。
It turned out that I was right. They changed the brands from January 30 to February 9 as they said they would do on February 9.
最简单的方法是把大家都放了，这也是最安全的方法。
The easiest way is to let everyone go. It's the safest way.
但放了以后，团队和和营业重启会很麻烦，很可能团队和人心就散了。
When released, however, the team and the business restart can be cumbersome, and the team and the public are likely to break up.
我觉得哪怕让大家在这扫扫地、拖拖地、做做培训，只要人在一起，心就在一起，团队就不会散，团队才是最重要的。
I think even if we let people sweep the floor, mop the floor, do training, as long as people together, the heart together, the team will not break up, the team is the most important.
这个策略相对来说比较激进，实际上没有对错，要看你自己判断和自己想要什么。
This strategy is relatively radical, and in fact there is no right or wrong, depending on your own judgment and what you want.
从1月28号开始，我们连续开了三天高管会议，分别讨论了经营、运营、团队三个层面，并做出了这些决定和判断。
Starting on January 28th, we met for three consecutive days as executives discussed operations, operations, and teams, and made those decisions and judgments.
开完会后，我其实想当英雄，没想跟员工讲这些事情，也准备提前全额发工资。
After the meeting, I really want to be a hero, do not want to talk about these things with the staff, but also ready to pay full salary in advance.
当时我甚至通知我们供应商说谁家缺钱，可以把货款提前结给别人。
At the time, I even informed our supplier who was short of money to pay someone in advance.
我说，好不容易有了一次做英雄的机会。
I said it was hard to get a chance to be a hero.
但我们另外一个创始人林总劝我，最好还是老实点。
But another of our founders, Lin, always advised me to be honest.
后来我琢磨他是对的，还是审慎点好，万一事情不像我想象的那样，疫情真要持续超过3、4个月怎么办？这个过程我有很大的反复，后来选择认怂。
I wondered later whether he was right or prudent, and what if things didn't go on for more than three or four months, as I had imagined? I had a lot of back and forth about the process and then opted to admit it.
再开会时我说：“我选择当狗熊，不当英雄。
When I met again, I said, "I choose to be a bear, not a hero.
”于是后来我愿意接纳伙伴的这份心意，决定让伙伴们跟公司一起共度这个难关。
"I was willing to accept that desire and decided to let my partners spend the hard time with the company.
如果那时我没这么做，现在肯定后悔。
If I hadn't done that, I would have regretted it now.
虽然你可能没面子，甚至需要员工来帮助企业，但能让企业最后活下来不是最好吗？因为面子把自己企业搞完蛋了，这种案例蛮多的，其实挺可惜。
Although you may lose face, and even need staff to help the enterprise, but it is not the best thing to let the enterprise survive? Because face ruined their business, such cases quite a pity.
作为一个企业的负责人，审慎应该比乐观更重要，因为让企业活着，就是对自己、股东和伙伴最大的担当，而不是这时候去显得你自己有多么高大上、多么有英雄气概。
As the head of a business, prudence is more important than optimism, because to keep a business alive is to take the greatest responsibility for yourself, your shareholders, and your partners, not to show how tall and heroic you are.
现金流的警惕这次我能相对比较淡定，很重要的原因是我们现金流状况还算好，如果压力很大，估计我也会选择关店。
Cash flow vigilance I can be relatively calm this time, very important because our cash flow situation is good, if the pressure is high, I will also choose to close shop.
木屋烧烤现在有140多家门店，5000名左右员工，月营收约为一个多亿，目前每天我们的亏损额是150万左右，不到200万，一个月差不多亏损5000万。
With more than 140 stores and 5,000 employees, and a monthly revenue of about $1 billion, we are losing about 1.5 million dollars a day, less than 2 million, and nearly 50 million a month.
账上的现金流如果完全不采取任何措施，可以支撑三、四个月。
Cash flow on the books can last for three or four months if nothing is done about it.
我们跟西贝成本结构差不多，跟原材料相关的是大头，但如果没营业，也就基本没有了这块成本；另外最大的成本是房租和人工成本，我们一个月差不多有近3000万的房租成本，几千个员工都包吃住。
We have a similar cost structure to that of Sebe, which is related to raw materials, but if we don't do business, we basically lose this cost. The biggest cost is rent and labor costs, which cost us almost $30 million a month, with thousands of employees living and eating.
如果成本能降低，比如房租能免付、员工工资减半，能撑一年。
If the cost can be reduced, such as rent can be waived, staff wages halved, can last for a year.
这中间还有很多工作要做，毕竟房东和员工也不容易。
There is still a lot of work to do, after all, landlords and employees are not easy.
目前很多员工1月份的工资都还没发，我们的状况也很艰难。
Many of our employees haven't paid their January salaries yet, and we're in a tough situation.
2016年我经历过一次这样的事情，当时是被资本坑了，融资协议都签好了，最后说好的投资款却没到。
I experienced this once in 2016, when I was hit by a capital hole, financing agreements were signed, and good investments failed to materialise.
我们当时已经把手上的几千万全投进了规划的新业务，后来只能把刚开始的新业务全都砍掉，亏了2000万左右。
We had already committed tens of millions of dollars to the new business we were planning, and then we had to cut all the new businesses we had started, losing about 20 million dollars.
之后我一直害怕公司的资金链会出问题。
Since then I have been afraid that the company's money chain will go wrong.
那段日子生不如死，问谁借钱都没人给你钱，500万都没人给你，最后我把我自己的4套房子卖了三套、抵押给银行一套。
When I asked who would lend you the money and no one paid you five million, I ended up selling three of my own four homes and mortgaging them to a bank.
你不经历这些，你就不知道有多痛苦。
If you don't go through this, you don't know how painful it is.
如果当时我没过那一关，估计我和家人都要流落街头。
If I hadn't passed that level, I'd have expected to live on the street with my family.
那年冬天差不多也是这时候，我在北京还给大家开会打鸡血、给大家鼓劲，开完了在回酒店的路上，我老婆当时微信里给我发了一张图，我一看是一个房产证，上面是我老婆的名字，写着一套178平方米的房子。
At the end of the trip back to the hotel, my wife sent me a picture in a microphone. I saw it was a property certificate with my wife's name and a 178-square-meter house.
当时我很纳闷，说我们家钱都给公司了，怎么有钱买房子？老婆说我自己P了一个房产证给你看一看，我当时走在路上忍不住眼泪就掉下来了。
At that time, I was very puzzled, said that we all gave money to the company, how to buy a house? My wife said I had a house certificate for you to see, I was walking on the road and couldn't help but tears fell down.
我就觉得怎么会出现这样的事情，沦落到这种地步？但没办法，做企业风险是永恒存在的。
I thought how can such a thing happen, reduced to this point? But there is no way to do business risk is eternal.
这件事持续了三、四个月才把现金流转正，我在外面租房子也租了三年，后来才把房子又买了回来。
It took three or four months to correct the cash flow and I rented the house outside for three years before I bought it back.
图 /Pexels那次等于我们把最宝贵的现金流全都花掉，导致公司的资金链断了。
The picture / Pexels that we spent all of our most precious cash flow and broke the company's financial chain.
最后我自己凑了2000多万，我们其他股东加起来凑了差不多大几百万，总共凑了3000万，把事情顶过去了。
In the end, I scraped together more than 20 million dollars, and the rest of our shareholders put together almost a few million dollars and pulled it through.
之后我就知道这玩意很可怕，一次被蛇咬十年怕井绳，后来我特别警惕现金流这件事。
Then I knew it was horrible, once bitten by a snake for ten years, and then I was especially wary of the cash flow.
当时我和内部高管达成一个共识：不管怎么样，我们要保持公司账上有3~6个月的现金流——如果公司完全停摆，也能支付房租和人工的3~6个月的现金。
At the time, I agreed with our internal executives that, whatever the case, we had to keep the company's cash flow for three to six months - or pay rent and labor for three to six months if the company stopped completely.
只有这样我们才能睡着觉，这个钱是不允许动的。
Only then can we sleep, the money is not allowed to move.
自由现金流才是自己的现金流。
Free cash flow is their own cash flow.
千万别到最后别人一要账，你自己就负掉了，最后发现帐上一分钱没有了。
Don't take it at the last minute, you lose it yourself, and you end up with nothing in the account.
很多人平时不重视，我们自己分析，这次疫情中最难受的是那些过度发展、甚至举债发展的公司。
Many people do not pay attention to, we analyze ourselves, the most miserable in this epidemic is the overdevelopment, even the development of debt companies.
本身他们运营还不扎实，又扩张很快，我自己也看到过一些内部资料，有一个企业我都不知道具体名字，它营收几个亿，现在在全国有几百家门店，但账上的现金流基本为0，因为他认为过年这段时间是他收割的时候。
I have seen some inside information myself. I don't even know the name of one company. It has hundreds of stores all over the country, but its cash flow is basically zero because he thinks it's the time for him to harvest.
塞翁失马，焉知非福。
No cross, no crown.
失败是成功之母，你没失败过，没尝过这件事情有多难受，怎么会改变？人都是这样。
Failure is the mother of success.You haven't failed, you haven't tasted how hard it is, how can it change? It's the way people do.
现在我觉得经历这些事挺好，因为我们团队到现在为止，还没有经历过这种大型危机。
Now I think it's good to go through this because our team hasn't experienced such a big crisis so far.
但现在的问题跟2016年的问题不一样，当时的问题是我们过度扩张造成的，但主业没太大问题。
But the problem now is not the same as it was in 2016, when the problem was that we were overextended, but the main business wasn't too much of a problem.
现在很多企业的主业也没问题，只是短时间的现金流出了问题。
Many businesses are now the main business is no problem, just short-term cash outflow from the problem.
2016年资金链的空缺我自己还能顶住，但现在对我来说不是两三千万的问题，而是一两个亿的问题。
The 2016 gap in the funding chain is something I can handle on my own, but it's not a matter of twenty or thirty million for me, but one or two billion.
现金流就相当于一个人的血液，很可怕。
Cash flow is the equivalent of a person's blood, very terrible.
血液平时看似不重要，流一点血你会觉得无所谓，觉得心脏比血更重要。
Blood does not seem to be important at ordinary times, flow a little blood you will feel indifferent, feel the heart is more important than blood.
但就是看似不重要的血液，如果全部放光，心脏、肝肺再好，还是得死。
But even seemingly unimportant blood, if all the light, the heart, liver and lungs, or die.
在企业困难的时候现金为王，这句话一点没错。
It's true that cash is king when business is in trouble.
我估计这件事情结束了以后，所有活下来的企业都会得到这个教训。
I suspect that when this is over, all surviving businesses will learn the lesson.
尽一切可能活下来对木屋烧烤来说，我觉得目前第一件事情是安全，配合国家做好防疫工作、无条件服从政府的任何要求，因为现在人命关天，要确保好我们员工和顾客的安全；第二件事情是维持公司正常营业，照顾好员工的生活，让团队稳定不散。
The first thing I think about the log cabin barbecue is safety, working with the country to do a good job of immunization and complying unconditionally with any government demands, because people are dying to make sure our employees and customers are safe. The second thing is to keep the company open, take care of the workers' lives and keep the team stable.
为了配合政府防疫，现在我们堂食已经全部停掉，只有少量外卖。
As part of the government's vaccination campaign, all our parlours are now closed, except for a few take-out deliveries.
外卖收入现在也是杯水车薪，大概占原来收入的20%左右，因为运力根本不够，为了防止疫情，外卖也受了限制。
Revenue from take-out is also now running low, at about 20 per cent of revenue, because capacity is simply insufficient and take-out is limited to prevent the outbreak.
做零售业还可以想点办法，像我们很多门店附近如果发生疫情，国家规定会直接关掉，做什么努力都没用。
Retail trade can also do something, like many of our stores in the vicinity of an outbreak, the state will directly shut down, do nothing to help.
最早我动过要跟员工谈工资薪酬的想法，但那时不敢说，怕员工生气、反弹。
I was the first to talk to employees about the idea of salary, but then dare not say, afraid of employees angry, rebound.
这件事情弄不好，团队会散掉，那就宁愿不做。
If it doesn't work and the team disperses, it's better not to do it.
自救运动发起后，我其实还是不敢，最后等到匿名调查问卷结果出来后，我才觉得这件事可以做。
After the self-help campaign started, I didn't dare, and finally waited until the anonymous questionnaire results came out that I thought it was okay.
本身疫情可能撑个两三个月就过去了，但如果你为了给自己增加点保险系数，最后把团队搞散了，相当于搬起石头砸了自己的脚，所以当时我坚决要求做匿名调查，做完了以后，公司才最后做决策。
The outbreak itself could have lasted for two or three months, but if you finally broke up the team to give yourself a little more insurance, it would be like throwing stones at your own feet, so I insisted on an anonymous survey.
很多人问我，为什么别的企业做不了，你们能做，为什么你们会有这么高的支持率？后来小伙伴的一个回答让我觉得挺好，他说我们的企业文化叫“百城千店，有我一份”，实际上我们一直在把木屋烧烤的事业做成大家的事业，小伙伴中也有很多人说，百城千店有我一份，共度难关也应该有我一份。
A lot of people asked me why other businesses can't do it, why do you do it, why do you have such high approval ratings? Later I was impressed by a reply from a small partner who said our company culture is called "Hundred City Thousand Stores, Have Me".
我觉得这就是平时对待员工，善良其实大于聪明，要看你跟伙伴是共创共享的关系还是利益互相博弈的关系。
I think this is the usual treatment of staff, kindness is actually more than smart, depending on you and partners is to create a shared relationship or mutual interests game relationship.
如果是后者，到了危难关头别人问你多要点钱甚至要拍屁股走人都很正常。
If it's the latter, it's normal for someone to ask you for more money or even to slap your ass in a crisis.
我们平时的投资分红有一个计划：不管你是穿串阿姨还是总监，只要你在公司工作满三年，就有份额可以去投资、参与分红。
Our usual investment bonus plan: Whether you're wearing an auntie or a superintendent, as long as you've been with the company for three years, you have a share of the investment and dividends.
到现在为止，我们大概有接近10%的员工有这个份额，在我们做问卷调查时，有公司股份的人的支持率远远高于那些没有的人。
Up to now, we have about 10% of employees with that share, and when we did the survey, people with company shares had much higher approval ratings than those who didn't.
图/Pexels对于其他公司来说，我觉得目前最重要的还是两件事。
For other companies, I think the two most important things right now are two things.
一件是想办法筹钱、开源节流。
One is to find ways to raise money and save money.
实在不行，能处理掉的资产要处理，跟我那时候卖房子一样，当然你得看好你事业，如果你这个事业本身就有问题，也没必要维持。
No, you can't dispose of the assets you can dispose of, just as I did when I sold the house. Of course, you have to look after your business, and if you have a problem with the business itself, there's no need to maintain it.
第二件事情是，你要跟你的团队去聊，该减薪要减薪，不能逞能。
The second thing is, you need to talk to your team about the pay cut, not the bravado.
我觉得要悲观一点，如果日后好了，多补偿一点，但现在你得活着，只有活着，将来才有希望补偿人家，你现在想当英雄，最后死掉了怎么办？企业文化现在做肯定来不及，但如果你跟员工真诚地去谈，能谈多少是多少，能少一分就少一分，能减一点就减一点，拿我们一个高管的话说，“就算是个苍蝇腿，我也不嫌”。
But now you have to live, and live, and have hope of making amends for others, and you want to be a hero now, and die in the end?
你一定要记得这是个团队，团队的每个成员对团队和企业，都有一定支持度，人都有情感，别把人性看得太坏了。
You have to remember that this is a team. Every member of the team has a certain level of support for the team and the enterprise.
本质上我们是小公司，单从员工人数上看，西贝是我们的3倍，海底捞是我们的20倍，现在餐饮企业万一出点问题，对社会影响和稳定就业都会有一定影响。
In essence, we are a small company, in terms of the number of staff, Sebelius is three times as many as us, bottom fishing is 20 times as much as we, now restaurant enterprises, a problem will have a certain impact on the social impact and stable employment.
但关于西贝送员工到盒马上班的事情，我不知道人家企业怎么想的，但我们宁愿给员工发工资，也不会让大家去盒马上班。
But I don't know what the company thinks about Sipper sending his staff to work in a box, but we'd rather pay our employees than let people go to the box.
当企业生意不好的时候，你把你员工送到别的企业去挣工资了，你觉得作为一个老板该这么干吗？员工又会怎么想？你觉得去了阿里他们还会回来吗？这个理如果谁再看不透，我觉得是天底下最大的傻瓜，哪个老板如果觉得这是一个让他避免损失的一条路，我觉得他把公司直接关闭算了。
What do you think you should do as a boss when business is bad? What do employees think? Do you think they'll come back when you go to Ali? I think it's the biggest fool in the world.
其实公司目前也没什么大的改变，我们刚开完战略复盘会，要根据现在的整体大环境，对整个年度计划和年度经营做大的修正调整，该干啥干啥。
In fact, there is no major change in the company, we have just finished the strategic re-disk meeting, according to the overall environment, the whole annual plan and annual operations to make major adjustments, what should be done.
这次情况的严重程度还是大大超出了我们的预测，我推测全面复工可能会拖到3月中旬。
The severity of the situation is still much higher than we had predicted, and I assume that full resumption of work could be delayed until mid-March.
但遇到这种情况，是全社会的困难，你得认。
But this kind of situation, is the whole society's difficulty, you must recognize.
