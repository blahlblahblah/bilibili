随着新冠肺炎疫情在全球持续蔓延，目前除南极洲外六大洲均有确诊病例。
With the global spread of the new crown pneumonia epidemic, there are now confirmed cases on all six continents except Antarctica.
截至北京时间3月2日19时，全球除中国外共65个国家和地区报告新冠肺炎累计确诊病例9000余例。
By 1900 hours Beijing time, 65 countries and regions outside China had reported more than 9,000 confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia.
此前世界卫生组织总干事谭德塞2月28日宣布，将新冠肺炎疫情全球风险级别由此前的“高”上调为“非常高”。
Earlier, on February 28, World Health Organization Director General Lindsay Tan announced that the global risk of pneumonia was raised from the previous "high" to "very high.
在疫情暴发初期，口罩供应短缺在国内外都曾引起过抢购。
In the early days of the outbreak, shortages of masks caused panic buying at home and abroad.
不过随着中国疫情防控态势逐渐好转以及国内产能大量释放，中国国内市场的口罩已不再是一货难求，而在韩国、意大利等新增确诊病例大量出现的国家，口罩仍是紧缺商品。
But masks are no longer a problem in China, as prevention and control efforts gradually improve and domestic capacity is released, while in countries with a large number of newly diagnosed cases, such as South Korea and Italy, masks are still in short supply.
不过当疫情在更多国家蔓延的同时，一个令人啼笑皆非的现象开始出现——在日本、美国、澳大利亚等多个国家，市民涌入超市，大量购买和囤积日常生活物资，其中最具有代表性的商品之一竟然是卫生纸。
But as the epidemic spread to more countries, a paradoxical phenomenon began to emerge - in Japan, the United States, and Australia, among others - as citizens poured into supermarkets, buying and hoarding daily goods, one of the most representative of which turned out to be toilet paper.
据日本放送协会（NHK）报道，受民众抢购潮影响，熊本市在卫生纸和纸巾等日用品方面出现缺货，有的商店在卫生纸区还贴出告示：“每人最多只能买一个”。
According to the Japan Broadcasting Association (NHK), the city is out of stock in toilet paper and paper towels as a result of the rush to buy them. Some stores have put up signs in toilet paper areas saying: "You can only buy one per person."
图片来源：新华社虚假消息引发的卫生纸抢货潮据日本厚生劳动省消息，截至日本时间3月1日10：30，日本国内新冠肺炎确诊感染者共947人，其中日本国内的感染者和从中国来日旅游的感染者人数为228人，“钻石公主”号邮轮上确诊的感染者人数为705人，乘包机回国的感染者人数为14人。
2007-9-25 21: 48 Japan has 947 confirmed cases of pneumonia at 10: 30 pm (Reuters) - The number of people infected with the virus in Japan and coming from China was 228, while the number of confirmed cases on board the MV Princess Diamond was 705 and the number of those who returned home on chartered flights was 14, the ministry said.
疫情蔓延到日本之后，作为防疫必需品的口罩并没有马上告急，日本民众却突然开始疯抢卫生纸，超市、药妆店等地的厕纸均被“抢购一空”。
When the epidemic spread to Japan, where masks were not immediately on the line, people rushed to grab toilet paper and toilet paper was snapped up in supermarkets, dressing shops and other places.
据上观新闻报道，在日本社交媒体上搜索“厕纸”，会弹出“无法从中国进口原材料”“日本难以生产厕纸”等虚假信息，大量不知情的日本民众因此涌入超市“疯狂囤货”。
A search for "toilet paper" on Japanese social media could pop up false information such as "unable to import raw materials from China" or "Japan's difficulty in producing toilet paper," prompting a flood of unwitting Japanese to "stock up" in supermarkets, according to top news reports.
在这波抢购大战中，有人顺利抢到，喜不自禁地在社交媒体上晒出“战利品”；还有人没能如愿，只能遗憾地面对“空荡荡的货架”。
In this rush-purchase war, someone managed to grab it and splashed out "spoils" on social media; others failed to do so, regretting "empty shelves."
日本人疯狂抢囤卫生纸的行为甚至惊动了首相。
Japan's frantic hoarding of toilet paper has even spooked the prime minister.
日本首相安倍晋三2月29日在举行记者会时，就日本政府在防疫方面所采取的措施，对日本国民进行了解释说明。
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, speaking at a press conference on February 29, explained the measures taken by the Japanese government in the area of epidemic prevention.
安倍表示，3月份要实现一个月生产6亿只口罩，确保供给。
Abe said he would produce 600 million masks a month in March to ensure supplies.
他同时强调，像厕纸这样的商品，日本国内生产量完全能够满足市场需求，而且库存很足，不存在货源短缺的问题，所以请大家冷静购买。
He also stressed that Japan's domestic production of products such as toilet paper is sufficient to meet the market demand, and stocks are sufficient, there is no shortage of supplies, so please buy calmly.

因为美国和澳大利亚也开始燃起了卫生纸抢购潮。
Because the United States and Australia also began to ignite the toilet paper rush.
美国超市首次出现卫生纸售磐新型冠状病毒在美传播以来，近日华盛顿州已宣布进入紧急状态。
A state of emergency has been declared in Washington state since the first appearance of a new coronavirus in American supermarkets.
随着疫情升级，美国民众也开始囤货的浪潮。
As the epidemic escalated, Americans also began to hoard goods.
据当地媒体报道，上个周末，在美国华盛顿州西雅图市南部的一家大型超市里，大量顾客排队购物，许多人的购物车里都装着洗手液和消毒湿巾，而医用口罩和卫生纸已售罄。
A large number of shoppers queued up at a major supermarket in the southern city of Seattle, Washington, last weekend, many with hand sanitizers and disinfectant wipes in their shopping carts and sold out of medical masks and toilet paper, local media reported.
俄勒冈州的超市也出现了类似的情况。
A similar situation occurred in supermarkets in Oregon.
忧心忡忡的顾客挤满了商店，把卫生纸、纸巾、瓶装水、小吃、罐头食品等商品一扫而空。
Skittish customers packed the shops and emptied toilet paper, tissue paper, bottled water, snacks and canned food.
一名顾客表示：“灾难来临时，卫生纸就像金子一样珍贵。
"When disaster strikes, toilet paper is as precious as gold," says one customer.
”而店员们则表示，这是该超市历史上第一次出现卫生纸售罄的情况。
For the first time in the supermarket's history, shop assistants said toilet paper was sold out.
在加州旧金山南部的一家超市，刚开门后的30分钟内就涌进了500多名顾客，几小时内就扫光了所有瓶装水和卫生纸。
At a supermarket in southern San Francisco, California, more than 500 customers poured in within 30 minutes of opening the door and cleaned all bottled water and toilet paper within hours.
一名顾客拍下空空如也的货架发到社交媒体上，并配上文字称：“新冠肺炎把大家都逼疯了。
One customer snapped empty shelves on social media and added: "The new crown pneumonia is driving everyone crazy.
我从没见过超市里有这么多人，比‘黑色星期五’购物节人都多，瓶装水、卫生纸、肉，还有很多东西都被抢光了。
I've never seen so many people in the supermarket, more people shopping than Black Friday, bottled water, toilet paper, meat and a lot of stuff.
”卫生纸抢囤潮还刮到了澳大利亚、新西兰等国家。
The hoarding of toilet paper also hit countries such as Australia and New Zealand.
记者在微博上注意到，多位定位于澳洲的微博网友晒出了照片。
Reporters on Weibo noted that a number of microbloggers located in Australia have basked in photos.
定位显示是澳大利亚悉尼、网名叫SonwKiss雪妍的网友表示：澳洲这几天多了两例从伊朗入境的确诊案例，结果超市就被抢空了，首当其冲的就是卫生纸和罐头食品……日本新生堂药店的店长森山对媒体说，一般店铺中午之后就无法再买到厕纸，同时还有人利用这一暂时缺货的情况，在二手市场高价倒卖卫生纸。
Australia has had two more confirmed cases of entry from Iran over the past few days, led by toilet paper and canned food, said Sam Shan, director of Sunshine Shop, a Japanese store manager.
当店员询问顾客为何要抢购厕纸时，对方基本都表示是看到网络上与新冠肺炎相关的传闻，因此担心日用品紧缺而来囤货。
When asked why customers snapped up toilet paper, shop assistants often said they had seen rumors of cases of pneumonia on the Internet and worried about stock-outs.
原来，有日本的社交媒体在网上流传着：“厕纸和口罩使用的是相同材料，而厕纸的生产地是中国，因此厕纸和纸类制品都会出现短缺，最好提前购买。
"Toilet paper and face mask are made of the same material, and toilet paper is produced in China, so there will be shortages of toilet paper and paper products, so it's best to buy them in advance," a Japanese social media outlet said.
”记者注意到，针对原材料依赖进口的传闻，日本官方已经出来辟谣。
Correspondents have noted that Japanese officials have come forward to dispel rumours of a dependence on imports of raw materials.
日本家庭纸工业协会发布声明，日本国内厕纸和口罩用的并不是同一种原料，也不依赖从中国进口，目前98%的厕纸是日本制造，只要不疯狂抢购就不会出现短缺。
The Japan Household Paper Industry Association said it does not use the same material for toilet paper and face masks in Japan, nor does it rely on imports from China.
日本经济产业省也出面辟谣，并呼吁日本民众保持冷静，不要相信谣言，正常采购生活物资就可以，让卫生纸回归正常的生产和销售轨道。
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry also came forward and called on the Japanese people to remain calm, not to believe rumors, normal procurement of supplies can be allowed to return to normal production and sales track.
中国贸促会研究院国际贸易研究部主任赵萍接受记者采访时表示，无论日本还是美国，生产卫生纸的产业链都是比较完善的，所以不太可能出现因原材料短缺影响物资供应的情况。
In an interview with reporters, Zhao Ping, director of international trade research at the China Council for Trade and Development, said the chain for making toilet paper was relatively perfect in both Japan and the United States, so shortages of raw materials were unlikely to affect supplies.
“只要不发生大规模的抢购，卫生纸满足日常供应是没有问题的。
"As long as there is no major rush, there is no problem with toilet paper meeting the daily supply.
”美国人均卫生纸消耗量居全球第一正在美国读研的留学生李慧（化名）向记者表示，与中国人相比，美国人清洁卫生的习惯存在一定的差异。
Li Hui (not her real name), a US student studying in the US, told reporters that there were some differences in the cleanliness and hygiene habits of Americans compared with the Chinese.
“我们在清理厨房或者卫生间的时候，喜欢用抹布，但美国人不太喜欢循环用抹布，更喜欢用卫生纸或者一次性的纸抹布来清洁卫生。
"We like to use a rag when we're cleaning our kitchen or bathroom, but Americans don't like to recycle rags. We prefer toilet paper or disposable paper rags for cleanliness.
”根据环保组织地球和自然资源保护委员会(NRDC)的报告，美国消费者每周使用大约3卷卫生纸，占世界卫生纸消费量的五分之一。
US consumers use about three rolls of toilet paper a week, or a fifth of the world's total, according to the Earth and Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.
这一报告表示，美国使用的卫生纸等一次性纸巾都是由木浆制成的，这些木浆大多来自加拿大北部的原始森林，而加拿大的伐木公司每年砍伐的森林面积超过100万英亩(合40.5万公顷)。
Disposable tissues, such as toilet paper, are made of wood pulp, mostly from virgin forests in northern Canada, where logging companies cut more than one million acres (405,000 hectares) a year, the report said.
日前，由美国和加拿大两大环保组织发表的一份报告显示，美国人均每年要消耗141卷厕纸，用量排在世界第一；日本则排在第四位，人均每年消耗91卷厕纸。
The average American consumes 141 rolls of toilet paper a year, the world's largest, while Japan comes in fourth with 91 rolls of toilet paper per capita a year, according to a report by two environmental groups in the United States and Canada.
电商渗透率低可能是诱因新冠肺炎疫情在中国暴发后，尽管给人们采购生活物资带来了一定影响，但多数消费者还是可以通过购物网站轻松买到自己需要的商品。
Low penetration may have been the cause of the outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia in China, but despite the impact on people's procurement of supplies, most consumers can easily buy their own goods through shopping websites.
但对于其他国家的消费者而言，可能并不那么轻松。
But it may not be that easy for consumers in other countries.
赵萍在接受记者采访时表示，尽管日本超市的商品很丰富，但电商市场渗透率与中国相比差距很大——日本网上零售额占社会消费品零售总额的比重不到10%。
In an interview with reporters, Zhao said that although Japanese supermarkets are rich in goods, the penetration rate of e-commerce lags far behind that of China - with retail sales on the Internet accounting for less than 10% of total retail sales of consumer goods.
电商渗透率低、商品配送链条不完善，有可能是消费者抢囤卫生纸等生活用品的诱因。
Electric commercial penetration rate is low, commodity distribution chain is not perfect, may be the inducement that consumer robs toilet paper and other daily necessities.
“而且日本对网购商品的配送费用很高，配送时间也比较长，对于卫生纸、大米这种体积大、单价低的商品，配送费用甚至可能超过商品本身价格，所以多数日本人都喜欢在超市购物。
"And Japan has high distribution costs and long delivery times for online purchases. For large, low-priced items such as toilet paper and rice, distribution costs can even exceed the price of the goods themselves, so most Japanese like to shop in supermarkets.
”赵萍说。
"said Zhao Ping.
中国信息通信研究院发布的《中国互联网行业发展态势暨景气指数报告（2019）》显示，2018年，我国网上零售额占社会消费品零售总额的比重达到18.4%，已成为全球电商渗透率最高的市场，比第二名的韩国高出6.4个百分点。
China's Internet Industry Development Trends and Climate Index Report (2019), released by the China Institute of Information and Communications Technology, shows that in 2018, China's online retail sales accounted for 18.4% of total retail sales of consumer goods, making it the market with the highest penetration rate in the world, 6.4 percentage points higher than the second-place South Korea.
根据美国商务部的数据，美国电商零售额在2019年约占零售总额的11%，高于2018年的9.9%；2019年美国电商销售额增长了14.9%，高于2018年同期13.6%的增速。
According to the United States Department of Commerce, retail sales in the United States accounted for about 11 per cent of total retail sales in 2019, up from 9.9 per cent in 2018; United States electricity sales grew 14.9 per cent in 2019, up from 13.6 per cent over the same period in 2018.
其中在2019年第四季度，美国电商零售额同比增长16.4%(未经季节性调整)，达到1870亿美元，全年达到6020亿美元，是5年前的两倍。
In the fourth quarter of 2019, retail sales in the United States increased by 16.4 per cent year-on-year (without seasonal adjustment) to $187 billion and reached $602 billion for the year, double the level of five years ago.
