”麦当劳的金拱门是商业社会最具代表性也是最成功的logo之一，不过最近由于疫情，连麦当劳也把M字logo分开了。
McDonald's Golden Arch is one of the most iconic and successful logos in the business world, but even McDonald's has recently split the M-logo because of the outbreak.
巴西麦当劳最近在社交媒体中晒出一张更新的麦当劳logo：M的两边被拆出了一定距离，目的是为了建议消费者“为了今后更好地相聚，暂时先保持距离一段时间”。
McDonald's in Brazil recently printed an updated McDonald's logo on social media: M was pulled apart to advise consumers to "stay away for a while in order to be better together in the future."
分开的金拱门关于这个营销创意，社交媒体的评论毁誉参半：一些人觉得创意有趣，也有人认为不应该拿这场全球流行病作为广告创意，“代理商不应该把流行病变成一条打算拿奖的广告”，有网友表示。
The separate Golden Arch comment on the marketing idea was mixed: some thought it was funny, others thought the global epidemic should not be used as an advertising idea, and "agents should not turn the epidemic into an advertising campaign intended to win awards," said one contributor.
不过这个创意毫无疑问在社交媒体引起了一波讨论——尽管它只是麦当劳在巴西市场的一场社交媒体营销。
But the idea has undoubtedly sparked a wave of discussion on social media - although it was just a social media marketing effort for McDonald's in Brazil.
麦当劳的金拱门logo于1968年正式启用，一个说法是，当时美国心理学家路易斯·彻斯金（Louis Cheskin）建议麦当劳用金色的拱门logo，因为可以让顾客看到这个标志时想到一对滋养的乳房，从而让人感到饥饿。
McDonald's gold arch logo was officially opened in 1968, according to Louis Cheskin, an American psychologist who suggested McDonald's use a gold arch to make people hungry because they could see it and think of a pair of nourishing breasts.
这个营销策略此后便被沿用至今。
This marketing strategy has been used ever since.
早前麦当劳也曾经短暂地在营销中改变过品牌的金拱门logo。
McDonald's had also briefly changed its brand of Golden Arch logo in marketing.
一个较为经典的案例是将“M”变成了“W”：这是其在2018年3月8日国际妇女节的创意，W意味着“Women”，以此彰显女性力量。
A classic case in point is the change from "M" to "W": it was invented on March 8, 2018, International Women's Day, and W means "women" as a way to assert women's power.
不过当时，这个创意也是赞誉与批评共存，有不少人认为简单地将logo翻转来庆祝妇女节，显得太懒惰不用心了。
At the time, though, the idea was one of praise and criticism, with many saying that simply flipping the logo around to celebrate Women's Day was too lazy.
“我今天感到超有力量，因为我是麦当劳的金拱门”，有网友反讽写道，这条推特当时有不少人点赞和转发。
"I feel super powerful today because I'm the golden arch of McDonald's," wrote one netizen ironically.
倒着的金拱门疫情期间，除了麦当劳这样官方将logo分开的，还有不少在社交媒体中引起网友热议的创意，也是将“隔离”应用到logo图案设计中。
During the inversion of the Golden Arch, in addition to the official separation of logos at McDonald's, there were also many ideas that sparked heated online discussions in social media, as well as the application of "isolation" to logo design.
比如设计师Jure Tovrljan就把不少品牌的logo给隔离了——Mastercard（万事达卡）原本logo是重叠在一起的红色和黄色圆圈，而新设计则是分开的两个圆；而星巴克的美人鱼则戴上了绿色的口罩。
Designer Jure Tovrljan, for example, isolates many brands of logos -- Mastercard, which originally had red and yellow circles that overlapped, and New Design, which had two separate circles; Starbucks Mermaid, on the other hand, wore a green mask.
