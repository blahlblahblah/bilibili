特约撰稿 李梦琪 本报记者 郭阳琛 石英婧 上海报道“我比很多同事都幸运，除夕是在家过的。
Written by Li Mengqi, a reporter for this newspaper, Guo Yang Chen, a quartz. "I am luckier than many of my colleagues.
”已经在抗击疫情一线连续奋战了二十多天，除夕夜能和家人在一起度过让武汉市肺科医院隔离病区护士吴青（化名）格外欣慰。
He has been battling the epidemic for more than 20 days, spending New Year's Eve with his family and letting Wu Qing, a nurse in the isolation ward of Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, take extra comfort.
由于武汉疫情的蔓延，每天连续工作9小时以上是吴青和隔离病区同事们的“常态”，中间只有午饭时间能歇一会，加班更是“稀松平常”。
Because of the spread of the epidemic in Wuhan, working more than nine hours a day is the "norm" for colleagues in Wu Qing and isolated areas.
作为武汉中心城区针对新冠肺炎疫情的三家定点救治医疗机构之一，武汉市肺科医院一直处于战线的最前端。
As one of the three designated medical institutions in Wuhan central city, Wuhan City Lung Hospital has been in the forefront of the front line.
吴青告诉《中国经营报》记者，目前医院共有三个隔离病区，包括ICU在内的确诊新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎患者超过100名，很多轻症或排除新型肺炎的发烧患者也无法入院治疗。
Wu told China Business Daily that there were three quarantined areas, with more than 100 patients diagnosed with pneumonia, including ICU, and many with mild or new-type pneumonia unable to be hospitalized.
与此同时，院方提供的防护措施以及社会的资助已经逐渐到位。
At the same time, protective measures provided by the hospital and social support have been gradually put in place.
更有众多武汉市民自愿组成志愿者车队，为吴青和其他医护人员提供免费上下班接送服务。
Many Wuhan residents have volunteered to form volunteer convoys to provide free transportation to and from work for Wu Qing and other medical personnel.
“医院、医护人员、患者、志愿者等都在努力，很多医护人员都像我一样逐渐增加战胜疫情的信心。
"Hospitals, health-care workers, patients, volunteers are all working hard, and many health-care workers, like me, are gradually increasing their confidence in overcoming the epidemic.
”3个隔离病区超百名确诊患者据吴青介绍，目前，武汉市肺科医院共有3个隔离病区，包括ICU在内收治的新型肺炎确诊患者共有100多人，“多的时候一个隔离病区每天会收治八九名新病人，少的时候整个医院新增10多个病人”。
According to Wu Qing, more than 100 new cases of pneumonia were diagnosed in Wuhan Lung Hospital, including ICU. "Sometimes one isolation ward admitted 89 new patients a day, and when there were more than 10 new patients in the hospital," Wu said.
“目前医院诊治压力蛮大的，所以只有高度疑似或重症患者才能入院治疗。
"Hospitals are currently under a lot of stress, so only highly suspected or seriously ill patients can be hospitalized.
”吴青告诉记者，患者到肺科医院后，先要到发热门诊做相关检查，包括拍CT、查血、咽试纸测试等，如果症状较轻或排除新型肺炎，医院会建议患者在家自行隔离或在门诊进行服药；如果患者检查结果高度疑似新型肺炎，我们会先收住院，然后再进一步做核酸实验进行确诊，“现在核酸实验的试剂盒是够用的，包括我们医院，基本上武汉每家定点医院都有条件进行核酸实验”。
"Wu Qing told reporters that patients to the lung hospital, first to the fever clinic to do relevant examinations, including CT, blood test, pharyngeal paper test, if the symptoms are mild or exclude new pneumonia, patients will be admitted to hospital, and then further nucleic acid test confirmed.
“在家隔离的患者最重要的就是随时要戴口罩，即使在家也是。
"The most important thing for people who are isolated at home is to always wear a mask, even at home.
”吴青建议，暂时无法入院治疗的患者，如果本身就有咳嗽、发热等症状，尽量要戴N95口罩。
Wu Qing suggested that patients temporarily unable to hospitalize should try to wear a N95 mask if they have symptoms such as coughing and fever.
同时，新型冠状病毒对热和酒精还是敏感的，出门回来后，可以在钥匙或者是门把手表面用酒精擦拭，并勤洗手。
At the same time, the new coronavirus is sensitive to heat and alcohol and can be cleaned with alcohol on the key or doorknob surface and wash hands frequently.
这么多的确诊和疑似新型肺炎患者，如何避免交叉感染？“我们会将同病种同病源的安排在一起。
With so many confirmed and suspected patients with new pneumonia, how can we avoid cross-infection? "We will arrange with the pathogen of the disease."
”吴青向记者表示，重症患者会尽量安排单间病房，男性和女性患者也是严格分开的，而一些高度疑似的病例也不会和确诊病例安排在一起。
Wu told reporters that patients with severe illnesses would try to arrange separate wards for men and women, and that some highly suspected cases would not be scheduled with confirmed cases.
吴青护理治疗的患者已经数不清了，但印象最深刻的是一名武汉本地中年女性患者。
Wu Qing nursing treatment patients have been countless, but the most impressive is a local middle-aged female patient in Wuhan.
吴青记得，这名患者刚开始入院时，内心十分恐慌、担心，每天都在手机上查找新型肺炎的资料，还时常拉着吴青和其他医护人员询问病情，吴青每次会跟她很耐心地做一些健康宣教，安抚她的心情。
Wu Qing remembers that when the patient first went to hospital, he was very frightened and worried. Every day he searched his mobile phone for information about the new type of pneumonia, and he often dragged Wu Qing and other medical staff to inquire about his condition.
“我觉得我的病症也不是那么重，为什么又吃这个药？为什么还不让我出院？”有段时间，那名患者情绪上开始出现波动，时不时向吴青抱怨。
"I don't think my condition is that serious, so why take this medicine? Why not let me out of the hospital?" For a while, the patient began to fluctuate, complaining to Wu Qing.
蔓延的疫情对医护人员是持久战，对病人也是。
The spread of the epidemic is a constant battle for health-care workers and patients alike.
病人开始怀疑一切，总觉得回家才会踏实、安全。
The patient began to doubt everything and always felt safe and secure when he went home.
“我觉得医护人员要做的就是用真心对待他们。
"I think all the paramedics have to do is take them from the heart.
”吴青表示。
"said Wu.
吴青告诉记者，渐渐地，那名患者也开始理解为她治疗的医生、护士们，后来只要有医护人员进病房，她都会说声“谢谢，辛苦了”，“我们听了心里也很感动，更开心的是几天前她终于如愿治愈出院了”。
Wu Qing told reporters that gradually, the patient also began to understand her treatment doctors, nurses, as soon as the medical staff entered the ward, she will say, "Thank you, hard," "We were very moved to hear the heart, but even more happily, a few days ago she finally cured and discharged.
（图片来源：受访者供图）“每个人都在战斗” 超30例肺炎患者被治愈“到现在为止，我们医院共有30余例病毒性肺炎治愈出院，这其中包括确诊为新型肺炎的，也有最后确认只是普通病毒性肺炎的。
2007-9-25 21: 48 More than 30 cases of pneumonia have been cured in our hospital so far, including those diagnosed with new pneumonia and those confirmed to be common viral pneumonia.
”在吴青看来，这是医院、医护人员、患者、志愿者等一起打赢的一场“阶段性战斗”。
According to Wu, it was a "staged battle" won by hospitals, medical staff, patients and volunteers alike.
武汉市肺科医院ICU医生陈玉梅主动推迟婚期，得知武汉“封城”消息后，直接打包行李住在医院；呼吸科医生曹探赜的爱人怀孕38周，因肾结石发作急诊住院需立即剖腹产，但因科室医生人手不足，曹探赜依旧坚守岗位值夜班；ICU主任医生胡明曾把1名呼吸骤停患者从死亡线拉回。
Dr. Yu-Mei Chen, an ICU doctor at Wuhan Lung Hospital, took the initiative to postpone the marriage and was informed that Wuhan was "closed." Her wife was found to be 38 weeks pregnant and needed an immediate cesarean section due to an emergency kidney stone attack.
因为患者病情危重，每天仅能休息2～3个小时，手因长时间罩在双层手套里总是肿胀发白，已经半个多月没见过九岁的儿子……“很多医护同事都暂时放下了‘小家’，留在疫情一线持续战斗，类似的故事也许每天都在上演。
Because the patient is critically ill and can only rest for two to three hours a day, his hands are swollen and whiter than he has seen in a double glove for more than half a month.
”吴青如是说。
"said Wu Qing.
“医院现在的防护措施还是比较充足的，口罩、防护服等物资也暂时没有空缺。
"The hospital is still relatively adequate protection measures, masks, protective clothing and other supplies are temporarily vacant.
”据吴青介绍，前段时间，武汉市肺科医院给每位医护人员发两盒维C泡腾片以增加免疫力；最近，医护人员办公室已经配备了一个大型的空气消毒机和一个小型的紫外线消毒机。
Wu said the city's lung hospital had given each doctor two boxes of vitamin C-foam tablets to boost immunity, and recently the office had been equipped with a large air sterilizer and a small ultraviolet disinfector.
医院也开始发放中药制剂和阿尔法干扰素，每人分别有12袋和2盒，“中药都是已经煎好的，这两种药都能起到一定的预防作用”。
Hospitals are also handing out Chinese medicines and alpha-interferons, each containing 12 bags and two boxes, "both of which are ready to be fried."
“让我觉得暖心的还有武汉民间的志愿者。
"Let me feel warm there are Wuhan folk volunteers.
”吴青表示，在武汉开始限行了后，很多她的同事都没有车，住得也很远，出租车也很难打到，网约车半小时都没人接单。
Wu said many of her colleagues had no cars and lived far away after the restrictions began in Wuhan, and taxis were hard to find and nobody had taken orders for half an hour.
“没想到有很多志愿者主动联系我们，派人专门开车接送。
"I didn't expect many volunteers to contact us and send someone to pick us up.
1月25日凌晨2点，志愿者管理员还在给我打电话，帮我联系一些住宿的地方。
At 2 a.m. on January 25th, the volunteer administrator was still calling me and trying to contact me for some lodging places.
”“我身边的朋友也是，知道医护人员出行不方便，然后就给我打电话，就问需不需要他们来接送上下班。
"" My friends around me, too, knew it was inconvenient for paramedics to travel and then called me to ask if they were needed to get to and from work.
不管是出行、住宿还是物资方面，每天都会有人来关心，让我们感觉有很多人跟我们一起在战斗。
Everyday, people come to care for us, whether we travel, stay, or provide goods, making us feel like there are many people fighting with us.
”吴青说。
"said Wu Qing.
但因为武汉“封城”，公共交通全部停运，吴青和很多同事没有时间精力每天回家，也担心“自己给家人增大感染风险”，住宿成了她们的“头等难题”。
But because Wuhan was "closed" and public transport was shut down, Wu and many colleagues did not have time to go home every day and worried that "increasing the risk of infection for their families" made accommodation their "number one problem."
由于武汉市肺科医院安排的住宿条件比较差，医院也一直在帮忙联系附近的酒店，但却不太顺利。
Hospitals have been trying to help contact nearby hotels because of poor living conditions arranged by Wuhan Lung Hospital, but they have not fared well.
“医院也是有心无力，前段时间我们连洗澡都要排长队。
"The hospital was also very weak. We had to wait in line to take a shower some time ago.
”吴青如是说。
"said Wu Qing.
武汉市肺科医院与同济协和医院挨得很近，医院周边还在营业且具备消毒杀菌条件的酒店本就不多，基本都被同济协和医院“承包”了。
Wuhan City Lung Hospital and Tongji Concorde Hospital close to the hospital, the hospital is still open in the vicinity of the disinfection and sterilization conditions of the hotel is not many, the basic Tongji Concorde Hospital "contracted."
吴青说，“我们医院是专科医院，不像大型三甲医院媒体报道力度那么大，我们在公开的、符合标准的房源里找，有些明确表示只接待同济协和医院。
"Our hospital is a specialist hospital, not like the big triple-A hospital," Wu said. "We look for it in open, standard rooms.
有酒店负责人还反问我们‘肺科医院是什么，媒体怎么都没提过？’”“现在医护的住宿问题也解决了！”1月26日晚上8时，吴青激动地告诉记者，肺科医院已经帮医护人员联系到了酒店住宿，“各行各界现在都在帮助我们，我们医护人员也会尽心尽力做好诊治工作，希望让社会看到更多患者被治愈”。
At 8: 00 p.m. on January 26, Wu told reporters excitedly that the Lung Hospital had helped doctors and nurses get in touch with the hotel accommodation. "All walks of life are now helping us, and our staff will do their best to see more patients being cured."
