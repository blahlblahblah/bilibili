记者/郭慧敏 屈畅 戴幼卿实习记者/李一鸣 龙天音编辑/计巍宋建华江夏区中医医院康复出院的工作人员在捐献血浆2月13日，武汉市江夏区中医医院的刘宇静从副院长那里得知，自己和本院另外18名康复医护人员的献血“全部有抗体，分离出来的血浆大部分用于救助江夏区的重症患者，部分支援金银潭医院”。
Reporter / Guo Huimin Qu Chang Dai Xiaoqing Intern Reporter / Li Yiming Long Tianyin Editor / Jianghua Jianghua District Chinese Medicine Hospital Rehabilitated Staff Discharged from the Chinese Medicine Hospital on Feb. 13, 2007.
虽然还不清楚血浆治疗的最终效果，刘宇静还是为这一份“希望”感到开心。
Although it was not clear what the final effect of plasma therapy would be, Liu was happy with the "hope."
同一天，国药中国生物（以下称中国生物）发布消息称，已完成对部分康复者血浆的采集工作，成功制备出用于临床治疗的特免血浆，并对两名危重患者进行了特免血浆治疗，目前连同后续治疗的危重病人已超过10人。
On the same day, Chinese Medicines China (hereinafter referred to as China Biology) announced that it had completed the collection of plasma from some of the recovered patients, successfully prepared a special plasma exemption for clinical treatment, and offered special plasma treatment to two critically ill patients, who now number more than 10, along with follow-up treatment.
2月14日，武汉市金银潭医院院长张定宇表示，金银潭医院已有4名患者接受了康复病人的血浆治疗，短期内看到向好迹象，生命体征逐渐稳定，精神状况得到改善，“目前主要还是用于重症患者，极其危重的患者临床应用效果不敢肯定。
On February 14, Zhang Dingyu, director of the gold and silver pool hospital in Wuhan, said that four patients had received plasma treatment from convalescent patients. There were positive signs in the near term that vital signs were stabilizing and mental health was improving.
”截至目前，特免血浆治疗方法仍面临许多挑战。
So far, plasma-free treatments still face many challenges.
中国免疫学会副理事长黄波在接受深一度采访时表示，如何筛选中和性抗体含量高的痊愈患者血浆，仍有待研究。
Huang Bo, vice-president of the Chinese Immunology Association, said in a deep interview that how to screen the plasma of patients with high neutralization antibody content remains to be studied.
资深疫苗专家陶黎纳也在采访中指出，目前新冠特免血浆来源于康复者，但产品化的特免血浆如何保证产量是一大问题。
Veteran vaccine expert Tao Li Na also pointed out in the interview that at present the new crown special exemption plasma originates from the convalescent person, but how the product-specific plasma guarantees the yield is a big problem.
江夏区中医医院护士长徐萍在得知自己捐献的血浆可以用于临床的消息后，有了一个新的念头。
Xu Ping, head nurse at Jiangxia TCM Hospital, got a new idea after learning that her donated plasma could be used in clinical practice.
本月底，她将前往江夏区方舱医院参与新冠病人的安抚和陪伴工作。
At the end of this month, she will go to Jiangxia District Fang Cao Hospital to participate in the new crown patients comfort and accompaniment.
在那里，徐萍希望能够让更多患者了解特免血浆治疗手段，参与血浆捐献，因为“他们都是很有希望治愈的”。
There, Xu hopes to make more patients aware of the special plasma treatment and participate in plasma donation, because "they are very promising to cure."
江夏区中医医院康复出院的医护人员在捐献血浆首批血浆捐赠者为康复后的医务人员徐萍是武汉市江夏区中医医院的一名护士长，也是特免血浆的第一批捐献者。
The first batch of plasma donors was donated by convalescent medical staff. Xu Ping was a head nurse at Jiangxia TCM Hospital in Wuhan and was one of the first donors to donate plasma.
1月20日，徐萍在上班时有些头晕，随后在CT检查中发现肺部感染，并被安排在本院进行住院治疗。
On January 20, Xu Ping went to work feeling dizzy, and later found a lung infection on a CT scan and was hospitalized.
在江夏区中医医院设为新冠肺炎定点医院前，有四十余名医护人员感染新冠肺炎，医院工作人员表示目前“感染途径很难完全确定”，在医院从事行政工作的刘宇静也是其中的感染者之一。
Liu Yujing, an administrative worker at the hospital, was one of more than 40 staff who contracted pneumonia before setting up the hospital in Jiangxia.
“具体怎么感染的到现在我也不清楚。
"I don't know exactly how it happened.
”1月16日，刘宇静感觉体温不正常去拍了CT，发现肺部有阴影，一个星期之后，她进行了核酸检测，确诊新冠肺炎。
"On January 16, Liu went for a CT scan of her febrile body and found a shadow in her lungs. A week later, she took a nucleic acid test to confirm pneumonia.
徐萍回忆，自己在住院治疗期间服用并注射过抗病毒及增强免疫力的药物，包括头孢曲松、白蛋白、莫西沙星等，同时服用清热解毒的中药。
Xu recalled taking and administering antiviral and immune-boosting drugs, including ceftriaxone, albumin and moxifloxacin, while taking antipyretic and detoxifying Chinese medicines during hospitalization.
刘宇静则“第一天就熬了中药，之后没断过”，另外服用了奥司他韦等西药，并注射消炎药，症状减轻之后采取了雾化等治疗方式。
Liu Yujing "on the first day of the boil Chinese medicine, after not break", in addition to taking oseltamivir and other Western medicine, and injection of anti-inflammatory drugs, symptoms reduced after taking atomized treatment.
在没有特效药的情况下，刘宇静认为最终能够康复得益于自身调理，“得多吃饭，保持好心情，让身体和心态之间形成良性循环。
In the absence of specific drugs, Liu believes that the ultimate recovery from their own conditioning, "have to eat more, maintain a good mood, let the body and mentality form a virtuous circle.
”武汉市金银潭医院院长张定宇在接受媒体采访时也表示新冠肺炎属于自限性疾病，通过人体的抵抗力和免疫调节，能够杀灭病毒，从而得到修复。
Zhang Dingyu, director of Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital, also said in an interview with the media that pneumonia is self-limited and can be repaired by killing the virus through body resistance and immune regulation.
1月28日，徐萍康复出院，6天之后，刘宇静也治愈出院。
January 28, Xu Ping convalescent discharged from hospital, six days later, Liu Yujing also cured.
住院治疗期间，为“鼓舞士气”，江夏区中医医院院长熊侃给所有患病住院的医护人员建了一个微信群。
During the hospitalization, in order to "boost morale," Xiong Kan, director of the Jiangxi TCM Hospital, built a microcosm for all the hospital patients.
2月4日，群里传来一条特别的消息：现在有很多重症患者，他们唯一的希望是输入康复者携带抗体的血浆，因此倡议康复者捐献血浆。
On February 4, a special message came from the group: there were many seriously ill patients whose only hope was to enter the plasma of the recovered person carrying antibodies, and the convalescent were encouraged to donate blood plasma.
“之前从来没有了解过血浆治疗。
"Plasma therapy has never been known before.
”徐萍说。
"said Xu Ping.
很快，同事在群里发了一张新闻截图，报道中称非典时期也采用过血浆治疗的方法。
Soon, colleagues in the group issued a news screenshot, reported that the SARS period also used plasma treatment methods.
相比动员普通患者回来捐献血浆，徐萍觉得自己更适合做首批捐献者。
Xu Ping felt better suited to be the first donor than mobilizing ordinary patients to donate blood plasma.
据刘宇静了解，中医医院是首个进行血浆采集的医院，血浆捐献计划是院方跟江夏区第一人民医院沟通后确定的。
According to Liu's understanding, the TCM Hospital was the first hospital to conduct plasma collection, and the plasma donation program was established after the hospital communicated with the First People's Hospital in Jiangxia District.
“院长说治疗效果还不确定，但我觉得既然有希望救人就捐吧。
"The dean said the therapeutic effect is uncertain, but I think if there's hope of saving lives, give it.
”刘宇静说，“如果真的有用，让我们再捐一次也可以。
"If it really helps, let's donate it again," Liu said.
”2月5日，包括徐萍、刘宇静在内的第一批医护人员从家中来到医院捐献血浆。
The first batch of medical workers, including Xu Ping and Liu Yujing, arrived at the hospital on February 5 to donate blood plasma.
江夏区第一人民医院业务院长刘本德对捐献血浆的医护人员表示，采血主要是为了提取抗体，用于实验，以验证是否有疗效。
Liu Bender, director of operations at the First People's Hospital in Jiangxi province, told doctors and nurses who donated plasma that the blood was collected mainly to extract antibodies for testing and to verify whether they were effective.
每名捐献者的血浆采集需经过三十分钟，血量标准为女性300毫升，男性400毫升，“但两位男同事都选择捐献了550毫升，每位同事都希望能够多捐一点。
Each donor took 30 minutes to collect plasma, 300 ml for women and 400 ml for men, but both men chose to donate 550 ml and each colleague wanted to donate a little more
”徐萍说。
"said Xu Ping.
2月13日，刘宇静在微信群中询问捐献血浆的结果，副院长回复：“全部有抗体，分离出来的血浆大部分用于救助江夏区的重症患者，部分支援金银潭医院。
On February 13, Liu asked the microphone group about the results of the donation of plasma. "All the antibodies, most of the plasma isolated, were used to help the critically ill in Jiangxia.
”同日，徐萍在新闻报道看到“中医医院19个人的血浆将用于危重病人的救治”，她觉得很欣慰，“捐献的血浆只要能帮助到患者，我们就很开心。
"The same day, Xu Ping reported in a news report that" plasma from 19 people at the TCM Hospital will be used to treat critically ill patients.
”血浆捐献者知情同意书想能让更多人了解特免血浆治疗2月14日，徐萍报名支援江夏区方舱医院，本月底，她将前往那里参与新冠病人的安抚工作。
"The informed consent form sought to make plasma treatment more widely known. On February 14, Xu Ping signed up to support the Fangchai Hospital in the Jiangxia area, where she will travel at the end of the month to attend the pacification of patients in the new crown.
由于新冠肺炎存在从轻症到重症的变化过程，有些患者会产生恐惧情绪，需要有治愈经历的医护人员进行陪伴与分享，告诉他们这是一个必经的过程。
As there is a process of change from mild to severe crown pneumonia, some patients develop fear and need to be accompanied and shared by health care professionals who have a history of healing, telling them that this is a necessary process.
在那里，徐萍希望能够让更多患者了解特免血浆治疗手段，参与血浆捐献，因为“他们都是很有希望治愈的”。
There, Xu hopes to make more patients aware of the special plasma treatment and participate in plasma donation, because "they are very promising to cure."
在“特免血浆用于临床治疗”消息发布的当天，中国生物联合武汉血液中心发布了康复者血浆捐献倡议书。
On the day of the announcement of the release of the special plasma exemption for clinical treatment, the China Biology and Wuhan Blood Center released a proposal for plasma donation by rehabilitated people.
除武汉以外，广东、山西、江苏等地的捐献点也先后迎来捐献血浆的康复者。
In addition to Wuhan, Guangdong, Shanxi, Jiangsu and other places have also welcomed the donation of plasma rehabilitation.
据澎湃新闻报道，上海14日出院的28名新冠肺炎康复者中，有6人有捐献意愿，且已经有一例患者正在准备接受血浆治疗，国家卫生健康委专家组成员卢洪洲称，已经制定好详细方案，人员配备和仪器配备也已经到位。
According to Peng Pai news reports, six of the 28 new cases of pneumonia patients discharged from Shanghai on April 14 showed a willingness to donate, and one patient was already getting ready for plasma treatment.
同日，江苏第一例血浆抗体治疗在徐州医科大学附属医院成功实施。
On the same day, the first plasma antibody treatment in Jiangsu was successfully carried out in Xuzhou Medical University Hospital.
中国生物组建的专项科研攻关团队总指挥杨晓明2月15日对媒体表示，康复者血浆疗法不针对所有新冠患者，“主要针对重型和危重型”。
Chinese biological team leader Yang Xiaoming told the media on Feb. 15 that plasma therapy for convalescent patients is not aimed at all newly-crowned patients and is "mainly for heavy and critical cases."
目前危重病人人数多且死亡率高，而康复病人超过6000名，远远大于危重病人。
At present, the number of critically ill patients is large and the mortality rate is high, while the number of convalescent patients exceeds 6000, far greater than the critically ill.
在深一度的采访中，新冠肺炎康复者血浆采集点的工作人员表示，从13日晚开始，采集点电话不断响起，“具体接了多少数不清了，至少有四五十个。
In a deep interview, the staff at the plasma collection point of the new crown pneumonia patients said that from the evening of the 13th, the collection point phone kept ringing, "the exact number of people answered countless, at least 40 or 50.
”中国生物武汉生物制品研究所总经理段凯在采访中称，截至15日，已经接到280多个记名电话，有明确捐献意愿的有20多个，3位捐献者已完成采集。
In an interview, Duan Kai, general manager of the Wuhan Biological Research Institute of Biological Sciences in China, said more than 280 anonymous calls had been received as of the 15th.
武汉血液中心的工作人员表示，血浆采集对捐献者有一定要求，要满足年龄在18至60周岁，确诊感染过新型冠状病毒，出院后目前身体状况较好，没有其他不适。
Wuhan blood center staff said that the plasma collection of donors to meet the age of 18 to 60 years, confirmed to be infected with the new coronavirus, after discharge from the hospital is relatively good, no other discomfort.
一次捐献的血浆量在200毫升到400毫升之间，“血液中55%是血浆，45%是血细胞，血浆捐献后，血细胞还会返还到捐献者体内，补充一些温水后，很快血液就能恢复，不会对捐献者有副作用。
Blood plasma is 55% plasma and 45% blood cells. After plasma donation, the blood cells are returned to the donor. After some warm water is added, the blood will soon recover without any side effects on the donor
”一次采集时间约为20至30分钟，间隔14天后可再次捐献。
Collections take about 20 to 30 minutes at a time and can be re-donated after a 14-day interval.
金银潭医院院长张定宇在此前采访中表示，希望捐献血浆的行动能够持续下去。
Zhang Dingyu, director of the gold and silver pool hospital, said in an earlier interview that he hoped the donation would continue.
与此同时，他也强调血浆治疗方法存在一定风险，由于输入的是别人的血浆，里面可能含有过敏或其他一些不确定因素，“但是在一个救命的环境下，对于重症病人救治来说，这是一个必要选择，风险远远小于它的获益。
At the same time, he stressed the risks associated with plasma therapy, which may contain allergies or other uncertainties, "but in a life-saving environment, it is a necessary option for the treatment of critically ill patients, and the risks far outweigh the benefits.
”山西一名康复者捐献血浆（图/太原市红十字血液中心）特免血浆治疗仍有难题待解中国免疫学会副理事长黄波在接受深一度采访时称，患有新冠病毒肺炎的患者之所以康复，不是靠打针吃药实现的，而是机体的免疫系统被激活，病毒才得以清除。
A convalescent man in Shanxi donates plasma (picture / Taiyuan Red Cross Blood Center) plasma donation remains a problem. Huang Bo, vice-president of the Chinese Immunology Association, said in a deep interview that the recovery of patients with Newcastle virus pneumonia is not achieved by injecting drugs, but by activating the body's immune system.
“我们免疫系统中最强大的一种武器，就是激活了B细胞，从而产生抗体。
"One of the most powerful weapons in our immune system is the activation of B cells, which produce antibodies.
”黄波介绍，特免血浆的医学原理即康复患者体内会有抗体生成，其是由机体B细胞激活后所产生并释放到细胞外，进而进入血液中，故抗体存在于血液中。
The plasma-free medical principle, known as antibody production in convalescent patients, is produced by activation of the body's B cells and released outside the cell into the bloodstream, Huang said.
把含有抗体的血浆给患者输入，则可以利用康复者血浆里的抗体去对抗患者身体里的病毒。
Plasma containing antibodies are fed into the patient and antibodies in the patient's plasma can be used to fight the virus in the patient's body.
关于抗体发挥作用的具体过程，黄波称，病毒只有在进入细胞之后才具有生命力，而抗体跟病毒结合之后能够阻止其进入细胞，在此情况之下，病毒经过一段时间就能自行降解衰败。
Regarding the exact process by which the antibody works, Huang said the virus is only viable once it enters the cell, and that the antibodies bind to the virus to prevent it from entering the cell, in which case the virus degrades itself over time.
“不同的康复患者血浆中抗体含量不一致，有的高有的低，因此需要去筛选，利用抗体含量高的血浆去治疗效果会好。
"The plasma antibody content of different convalescent patients is not consistent, some high and some low, so it is necessary to screen, using high antibody content plasma treatment effect will be good.
”在黄波看来，血浆治疗仍面临一定的挑战。
In Huang's view, plasma therapy still faces some challenges.
抗体包括中和性抗体（当病原微生物侵入机体时会产生相应的抗体）和非中和性抗体，在利用康复者血浆中的抗体来对抗病魔时，两者都能发挥作用，但在对抗机制上有一定区别。
Antibodies include neutralizing antibodies (corresponding antibodies are produced when pathogenic microorganisms invade the body) and non-neutralizing antibodies, both of which have a role to play in fighting disease by using antibodies in the plasma of a recovering person, but there are certain differences in the mechanisms of confrontation.
“非中和性抗体种类多于中和性抗体，在治疗过程中，筛选中和性抗体含量高的痊愈患者血浆，仍然是相关研究中的一大挑战。
"There are more types of non-neutralizing antibodies than neutralizing antibodies, and screening plasma of recovered patients with high neutralization antibody content remains a major challenge in related research.
”资深疫苗专家陶黎纳在接受深一度采访时表示，新冠病毒特免血浆的另一待解难题就是产量。
In a deep interview, veteran vaccine expert Taurena said the other pending plasma-free challenge for the new crown virus is production.
目前，新冠特免来源于康复者，但产品化的特免不可能来源于康复者，因为这种来源并不稳定，且不能重复采集。
At present, the new crown exemption originates from the convalescent person, but the product special exemption cannot come from the convalescent person, because this kind of source is not stable, and cannot collect repeatedly.
加之每个康复者体内的抗体浓度不同，提炼后得到的新冠特免抗体浓度也可能无法准确定量。
In addition, the concentration of antibody in each convalescent person is different, and the concentration of the new crown antibody may not be quantitatively accurate.
“用多了会浪费宝贵的血浆，用少了可能会更糟糕。
"Too much of it wastes precious blood plasma, and less of it can be worse.
”陶黎纳称，在“非典”康复者血浆抑制SARS病毒的研究中，曾发现存在“ADE效应”，即抗体反而增强感染的效应。
In a study of plasma suppression of the SARS virus in patients recovering from SARS, an "ADE effect," in which antibodies enhance the infection, was found, Taurina said.
特异性抗体能够与病毒结合使其失去粘附能力，阻止病毒感染人体。
Specific antibodies can bind to viruses and make them unable to adhere to prevent virus infection.
但在某些情况下，这种抗体与病毒结合后反而能帮助病毒进入细胞，提高病毒感染力。
But in some cases, the antibody, combined with the virus, can help the virus enter the cell, making it more infectious.
“ADE通常发生在抗体浓度较低的情况下。
"AD Etong often occurs at low antibody concentrations.
也就是说，如果给患者治病的特免剂量不够，存在反而加重病情的可能。
In other words, if the patient is given a special dose of treatment is not enough, there is the possibility of aggravating the disease.
”陶黎纳说。
