王一博所在的《有翡》剧组此前宣布停工（图源：电视剧《有翡》官方微博）“ 虽然剧组复工踊跃，但短期来看，距离真正的复工还需要时间。
"While there has been a surge in activity, in the short term it will take time to get back to work," said Wang's "There was a message at work.
”2月10日，横店影视集聚区管理办公室下发关于确保新冠肺炎疫情防控期间影视企业（剧组）安全有序复工的指导意见。
On February 10, the Hengdian Film and Television Region Management Office issued guidance on ensuring the safe and orderly resumption of filmmaking during the prevention and control of the New Crown Pneumonia epidemic.
当中提到，第一阶段复工时间原则上不早于2月12日24时，且企业、剧组需经审批备案后才能复工。
As mentioned therein, the resumption of work in the first stage should in principle not be earlier than 2400 hours on February 12, and enterprises and drama groups need to be approved and filed before resuming work.
2月13日是横店复工首日，记者致电横店影视集聚区管理办公室，但工作人员均表示拒绝接受任何采访。
February 13 is the first day Hengdian resumption of work, reporters called the Hengdian video agglomeration area management office, but staff have refused to accept any interviews.
按照指导意见，横店影视城将分成三阶段逐步复工。
According to the guidance, Hengdian Film and Television City will be phased back into three stages.
春节期间，员工均留在横店，未到过疫情严重地区、未与疫情严重地区人员接触，且防控措施到位的重点影视企业（剧组）可以优先复工。
During the Spring Festival, employees stay in Hengdian, have not been to the areas with serious epidemic disease, and do not have contact with people in areas with serious epidemic situation, and prevention and control measures in place key film and television enterprises (drama groups) can be given priority to resume work.
第二阶段复工时间，根据疫情防控形势确定。
Second stage resume work time, according to the situation of disease prevention and control.
第三阶段复工时间，要等到浙江全省疫情防控措施解除后，才能恢复正常拍摄。
The third phase of the resumption of work, until the province of Zhejiang Province after the control measures to restore normal shooting.
复工流程和其他工业企业复工的程序相似，首先剧组要上交材料、健康证明，并上报有关部门审批。
The procedure for returning to work is similar to that of other industrial enterprises, in which the crew first submits the materials, health certificates and reports them to the relevant authorities for approval.
审批通过后，再按照管控要求组织复工。
After approval is granted, the work shall resume in accordance with the regulatory requirements.
图源：横店影视城娱乐频道但作为特殊行业，剧组人员密集、演员在拍摄期间很难带口罩，横店复工究竟安全吗？如果不能按时复工，对于档期衔接紧、停工期间开支大、签署明确上映时间合同的企业、剧组，又该如何减少违约成本、避免损失？根据横店影视集聚区管理办公室此前的回应，春节期间全程留在横店的约有6000人，100余个剧组。
Source: Hengdian Film and Television City Entertainment Channel But as a special industry, it is very difficult to wear masks during filming. If you can not resume work on time, how to reduce the cost of default and avoid losses?
目前来看，剧组对于复工相当踊跃，2月3日起就有不少申请，但截至11日尚未有申请通过。
So far, the cast has been quite enthusiastic about resuming work. There have been many applications since February 3, but no applications have been approved as of February 11.
13日上午，梨视频探访横店影视城。
13 morning, pear video visit Hengdian film and television city.
从视频中看，横店内演员服务部门口及内部空无一人，影视城内也少有人走动。
From the video, the Hengdian actor service department door and internal empty, film and television city few people moving.
一名群众演员表示，他未曾在任何工会演员群内收到复工的通知，只是从网上听说了复工的时间。
A mass actor said he had not been notified of his return to work in any of the union's cast, but had only heard from the Internet about the time of his return to work.
而之前提到的横店为群众演员提供生活补助，实际上只有群众演员和前景演员可以收到补贴，特约演员则不在补助的列表中，最终收到补助的群演约有1000多人。
The Hengdian District provides a living allowance for actors and actresses. In fact, only the mass actors and visionaries receive subsidies, while invited actors are not included in the list of grants, which eventually reach more than 1,000 people.
另一名群众演员则表示，他在群里得到了复工的通知。
Another mass actor said he had been notified of his return to work in the group.
有剧组发布招募称，可以给群众演员开100加10的工资，即超一个小时加十元。
One crew member announced that they could offer the mass actors 100 plus 10, or more than one hour and ten yuan.
疫情也波及到了横店影视城的生活区域，在横店的几处地标，比如横漂广场、横漂大酒店、万盛映像电影主题街，聚集的人群也不算多。
The epidemic also affected the Hengdian Film and Television City living area, in Hengdian in a few landmarks, such as the Piazza Horizonte, the Wangdrift Hotel, the Wan Sheng image film theme street, the crowd is not too large.
街道两旁的商铺大多处于关闭状态，仅有几家小超市、水果店开门迎客。
Most of the shops on both sides of the street are closed. Only a few small supermarkets and fruit shops are open.
这位演员在直播中表示，横店的菜市场大年初一仍在开门营业，后来才逐渐规范起来，要求测体温、戴口罩。
In the live broadcast, the actor said that the Hengdian Hengdian market is still open to business on the first day of the new year, then gradually standardized up, asked for temperature testing, wearing masks.
开门时间也进行了调整，目前仅在下午1点到4点营业，其余时间处在关闭状态。
Opening hours have also been adjusted and are currently open only from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., with the rest of the time closed.
但不同于横店内的其他商铺，对于剧组来说，停一天拍摄就意味着要承担一天损失。
But unlike other stores in the store, a day off means a day of loss for the crew.
即使不算上主要演员的酬劳，光是房租、场地、机器、人员工资，一天的固定支出就已经超过百万。
Even without the pay of the leading actor, the daily fixed costs of rent, space, machinery, and staff salaries alone exceed one million.
目前，已经爆出停工消息的剧组有《有翡》《谢谢你医生》《大江大河2》等，都是大剧组、大投资。
At the moment, there have been reports of work stoppages in China. At the moment, there is talk of work stoppages.
对于这部分剧组，应该怎么尽量避免损失？《有翡》剧照（图源：腾讯视频）韬安律师事务所的刘芳律师认为，若确实因疫情无法按约履行合同，可以主张不可抗力以免除违约责任。
At the time when there was talk of how to avoid losing money, Liu Fang, a lawyer at Tencent Law Firm, said force majeure could be claimed to absolve a person from liability for breach of contract if the contract could not be fulfilled because of the outbreak.
在2月11日全国人大常委会法工委就疫情防控有关法律问题答记者问里，就提到新型冠状病毒感染肺炎疫情“属于不能预见、不能避免并不能克服的不可抗力。
Responding to questions from the NPC Standing Committee on February 11 on legal issues related to the prevention and control of the epidemic, the NPC Standing Committee referred to the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic as "an unforeseen, unavoidable and insurmountable force majeure."
”在大经济条件偏向认定不可抗力的情况下，可以主张变更合同或解除合同。
A variation of the contract or rescission may be asserted in cases where the prevailing economic conditions are biased in favour of force majeure.
但对于签订时间发生在疫情期间，及签订时可以预见疫情造成影响的合同，则不得主张免除延迟履行的违约责任。
However, no exemption from liability for breach of contract for delayed performance may be claimed if the contract took place during the outbreak of the disease and the effects of the outbreak could have been foreseen at the time of signing.
而在横店，其实场地费已经被免除。
In Hengdian, in fact, the venue fee has been waived.
根据2019年12月横店发布的公告，影视城内现有的100个摄影棚，已经向电影及现代、当代、科幻题材类型的影视剧组免收租赁费。
According to the announcement issued by Hengdian in December 2019, 100 studios in TELA have been exempted from renting fees for films and modern, contemporary and science fiction genres.
对于在横店拍摄的剧组来说，占据支出一大部分的场地租金或许不用承担。
For studios filming at Hengdian, space rentals, which account for a large portion of the expenses, may not be borne.
此外，横店办公室还表示，为了进一步帮扶剧组尽快复工，地方政府层面还会出台一些优惠措施，包括资金补助。
In addition, Hengdian office said that in order to further help the group to resume work as soon as possible, local authorities will also put in place a number of preferential measures, including financial subsidies.
横店也会给予摄影棚、餐饮、住宿上的优惠。
Hengdian will also give studio, catering, accommodation on preferential terms.
比如酒店免部分房费，景区不收费等。
For example, the hotel is free of charge, scenic spots, etc.
为了保证拍摄安全，针对演员不能带口罩的情况，考虑不多于20人同时开拍。
To ensure the safety of filming, consider not more than 20 people shooting at the same time if actors are not allowed to wear masks.
按照“能少则少、能近则近”的原则，目前仍在疫情严重地区的人员，会劝导暂缓返回。
According to the principle of "less can, less can be close," people in areas where the epidemic is still severe will be advised to suspend return.
对于档期紧的演员来说，或许也会因为疫情造成后期拍摄时间上的重叠。
For starters with tight schedules, there may also be an overlap in late filming due to the epidemic.
刘芳律师提到，疫情发生后，就有演员向她咨询相关问题，在2月份的剧组已经被叫停的情况下，应该如何处理延期拍摄的合同和3月即将开拍的合同？刘芳认为，如果艺人因自身档期上的困难导致另一合同无法履行，恐怕难以对抗该合同的相对人。
After the outbreak, she was asked questions about what to do with the delayed filming contract and the contract to start shooting in March, Liu said, 'I'm afraid it will be difficult to confront the other party to the contract if they are unable to fulfill another contract because of difficulties with their own schedule.
因为在后的合同，并不因之前的不可抗力而“自动”延期或产生违约免责效果。
Because in the latter contract, prior force majeure does not "automatically" delay or produce a default exemption.
在此情况下，艺人应该与双方充分沟通、协调，尽可能达成补充协议调整档期。
In this case, artists and both sides should fully communicate and coordinate, as far as possible to achieve supplementary agreements to adjust the slotting date.
她回答记者，如果实在难以协商，则需要根据自己的参与程度、后续影响、违约条件等做出判断，法院也会考虑疫情因素酌情处理。
She replied that if it was really difficult to negotiate, the court would need to base its decision on the degree of participation, subsequent impact, conditions of non-compliance, etc., and the court would also take into account the epidemiological factors at its discretion.
但从她的观察来看，大部分片方都同意达成补充协议，愿意一同承担损失，演员的档期协调也相对灵活。
But, from her observations, most of the cast have agreed to a supplementary agreement, willing to share the losses, and relatively flexible in the timing of the actors.
总的来说，疫情虽然会打乱部分拍摄的节奏，但不会造成大面积的误工。
Overall, the outbreak will disrupt the pace of some filming, but will not cause widespread delays.
影视策划人谢晓虎认为，行业的黄金开机时间是4到9月，春节期间开工的剧组不算多。
Film and television planners Xie Xiaohu, the industry's golden start-up time is April to September, the Spring Festival start during the group is not much.
且按照业内普遍的工作状态，大部分能够在春节之前杀青的剧组，已经尽量在春节前结束拍摄。
And according to the general state of work in the industry, most of the film groups can be killed before the Spring Festival, as far as possible before the Spring Festival end filming.
而在横店原地待命的剧组，如今已经具备复工重新拍摄的条件。
In the Hengdian on standby at the set, now has the conditions to resume filming.
对于大中型影视公司和剧组来说，复工之后如何协调后续费用支出、安排主创演员的档期、保证剧作的完整度才是后续需要解决的关键问题。
For large and medium-sized film companies and studios, how to coordinate the follow-up expenses after the resumption of work, arrange the lead actor filming, ensure the integrity of the drama is the key issue to be solved.
