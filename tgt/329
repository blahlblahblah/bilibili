那天夜里，从晚上七点，至次日上午八点，她连续接诊200余位输液留观的病人，装备只有一次性外科口罩、帽子、白大褂和手套。
That night, from seven in the evening to eight in the morning, she treated more than 200 patients for infusion, equipped only with disposable surgical masks, hats, white coats and gloves.
接诊区患者爆满，病房里床位紧张，设备缺少、防护不够、人手不足。

Respondents for Beijing News reporter Du Wenwen: Some 4125 words, reading the full text takes about eight minutes. January 30 is the seventh day that doctor Wang Yang (alias) is alone in his home.
发烧还在持续，最高时39℃。

睡觉休息、吃药喝水填满日常。
Sleep rest, take medicine and drink water to fill your day.
每天中午和晚上，先生会把热乎的饭菜放在楼道走廊里，他走开，王阳才开门取餐。
Every day at noon and evening, Mr. A would put the warm food in the hallway. He walked away and Wang Yang opened the door for his meal.

1月22日，在连续高强度上了十几个小时班后，病毒袭击了这位武汉市某定点医院的医生，胸部CT提示左肺上叶阴影。
On January 22, after more than a decade of intensive work, the virus attacked the doctor at a designated hospital in Wuhan, with a chest CT scan revealing a shadow in the upper lobe of the left lung.
那天夜里，从晚上七点，至次日上午八点，她连续接诊200余位输液留观的病人，装备只有一次性外科口罩、帽子、白大褂和手套。
That night, from seven in the evening to eight in the morning, she treated more than 200 patients for infusion, equipped only with disposable surgical masks, hats, white coats and gloves.
接诊区患者爆满，病房里床位紧张，设备缺少、防护不够、人手不足。
The reception area was full of patients, beds in the wards were tight, equipment was lacking, protection was inadequate and staff was insufficient.
1月23日，肺部感染后，王阳被隔离在家治疗观察，但她看到医院内部职工的患病群里，人数一个个增加，从呼吸科、门诊、急诊，到消化科、神经内科、肾内科、手术室，几乎涵盖全院。
On January 23, after a lung infection, Wang Yang was quarantined for observation at home, but she saw an increase in the number of sick workers inside the hospital, ranging from respiratory departments, outpatient clinics and emergency departments to digestive, neurology, renal medicine and surgery, covering almost the entire hospital.
新京报记者从多个信源确认，该医院因病被隔离的医护人员至少50人，其中既有新型冠状病毒肺炎的疑似病例，也有只出现发热、腹泻但暂时还未做CT的医护。
The Beijing News reporter confirmed from several sources that the hospital was quarantined with at least 50 medical personnel, ranging from suspected cases of the new coronavirus pneumonia to medical attention with fever and diarrhea but no CT scan.
“这是我职业生涯里最没有底气的夜班”剥洋葱：你是什么时候发现自己被感染的？王阳：1月22日，是我们医院被指定为发热患者定点收治医院接诊的第一天。
When did you find yourself infected? Wang Yang: January 22, the first day our hospital was designated as a designated hospital for fever sufferers.
我所在的科室被改造成输液室，那一晚上接诊了200多个输液和留观病人，我负责处理输液病人各种突发情况，那是最困难的一夜。
My department was converted into an infusion room, and that night I had more than 200 infusions and patient visits. I handled all kinds of emergencies and that was the hardest night of all.
之前，我接诊过三例疑似病人，可能那个时候就潜伏感染了，当时只有普通的白大褂、外科口罩和帽子，因为那时候医院物资紧缺，只有呼吸科、急诊和重症医学科才配备三级防护，其他科室是二级防护。
I had previously treated three suspected patients, and probably had latent infection back then, with only ordinary white coats, surgical masks, and hats, because hospitals were in short supply, and only respiratory, emergency, and intensive-care services were equipped with level-III protection, while the others were secondary protection.
1月22日晚上我穿着防护服没睡，都是污染区，没有干净的地方，而且病人很多，根本忙不过来。
On the night of January 22, I didn't sleep in protective clothing. It was polluted, there was no clean place, and there were so many patients that I couldn't sleep at all.
后半夜我开始头疼、嗓子痛，我就想着可能是说话说多了。
I began to have a headache and a sore throat in the middle of the night.
1月23日早上下班回家后，中午出现低热，我就去家附近的医院做检查。
When I got home early on January 23 and had a low fever at noon, I went to the hospital near my home for a check-up.
我跟医生说，我有疑似病人接触史。
I told the doctor I had a history of suspected patient contact.
后来我的胸部CT显示肺部有斑片状的感染灶，符合疑似病例。
My chest CT later revealed a patchy infection of the lung, consistent with a suspected case.
我便请病假直接回家隔离休息了。
I took sick leave and went straight home for a rest.
我算发现得早，开了奥司他韦、头孢克肟等药，回家吃药观察，保证充足休息多喝水。
I discovered early, opened oseltamivir, cefacoxime and other drugs, home to take medicine observation, to ensure adequate rest and drink more water.
监测体温的变化，如果体温一直升高又出现其他症状就再去医院。
Monitor changes in body temperature and go to the hospital if your body temperature continues to rise and other symptoms develop.

受访者供图剥洋葱：你是怎样和家里人沟通自己被感染这件事的呢？王阳：我做CT那天，是我老公陪我一起去的。
Interviewee: How do you communicate with your family about getting infected? Wang Yang: On CT day, my husband accompanied me.
可能因为我比较年轻，拿到结果后他还是很乐观的，说那刚好在家里休息了，也不用去上班了，我妈妈也可以给我做点好吃的了。
Maybe because I am younger, he was optimistic after the results, just at home to rest, do not have to go to work, my mother can make me some delicious.
其实早在1月15日左右，接诊到第一例疑似患者，我只有二级防护，我就打电话让父母把孩子从家里接走了，现在就我一个人在家隔离，联系主要靠视频。
In fact, as early as January 15, the first case of suspected patients, I only secondary protection, I called my parents to pick up the child from home, now I alone isolated, mainly by video.
剥洋葱：最近几天在家隔离的生活是什么样的？王阳：还是经常发热，1月27日体温峰值升到了39℃，吃了一些退烧药，28日体温大概是38℃。
Wang Yang: Still had a fever, and the peak temperature rose to 39 degrees Celsius on January 27th, taking some antipyretics, and the body temperature on the 28th day was about 38 ℃.
我家人现在属于在医学观察期，他们属于密切接触者。
My family is now under medical observation and they are in close contact with each other.
院里呼吸科主任说，如果想去住院的话也可以，在家里也行，我自己还是倾向于在家。
If you want to go to the hospital, you can stay at home, or I prefer to stay at home, 'said the hospital's respiratory director.
每天我妈妈做好了饭以后，我老公就把饭送过来，放在楼道里，他走了以后我再开门去取。
Every day after my mother cooked the meal, my husband brought it to me and put it in the hallway. When he left, I opened the door to get it.
剥洋葱：这段时间里，哪一天的工作让你印象最深，能详细描述下吗？王阳：我们医院作为发热定点医院接诊的第1天，1月22日晚上。
Onion peeling: Which day of work impressed you the most during this time, can you describe it in detail? Wang Yang: Our hospital is the first day of receiving treatment in the fever designated hospital on the evening of January 22.
按照原计划，我们应该是1月23日晚上六点以后才开始接诊病人，但是22日下午我们病区改造成输液室，晚上七点就开始接诊病人。
According to the original plan, we should be on January 23 after 6: 00 pm patients, but our area was converted into an infusion room on the afternoon of 22 January, began to receive patients at 7 pm.
那时候病房还没开放，因为隔离病房污染区清洁区有很严格的要求，需要重新改造。
At that time, the ward was not open because of the strict requirements of cleaning the contaminated area in the isolation ward, which needed to be reconstructed.
病人住不进病房，只能在输液室留观。
Patients do not enter the ward, only in the infusion room to watch.
实际上我当时没有想到会有那么多病人，按照医院以往的流程，输液医生就是处理下输液病人的突发情况，我觉得是一个比较轻松的活。
In fact, I did not expect that there would be so many patients, according to the previous hospital procedures, infusion doctors are handling the next patients, I think it is a relatively light work.
但后来人太多，病人情绪也不好，有些病人等了很久不耐烦，就想抢先打针。
But later too many people, the patient mood is not good, some patients have been waiting for a long time impatience, just want to get the first shot.
还有的病人甚至是不适合来输液室留观打针的，已经到呼吸衰竭的程度，必须要上呼吸机了，但是输液室没有呼吸机，病房没有开，呼吸科也是满的。
Some patients were even unfit to come to the infusion room for injections, to the point of respiratory failure, and had to be put on a ventilator, but there was no ventilator in the infusion room, the ward was not open, and the respiration department was full.
那一晚上，我提心吊胆，请呼吸内科医生来会诊，但巧妇难为无米之炊，没有呼吸机没有设备，没办法进行处理。
That night, I was afraid to ask my breathing physician to come for a consultation, but she had no ventilator and no equipment to deal with it.
这在我职业生涯里面，从来没有上过这么没有底气的夜班。
Never before in my career have I worked such a shaky night shift.
我们都不敢吃饭，不敢上厕所，吃饭得去清洁区，就要脱掉防护服。
We are afraid to eat, to go to the toilet, to eat to clean the area, to take off protective clothing.
但每个人就只有一套，脱了以后再穿就是污染的，很可能感染自己。
But each person has only one suit, after taking off to wear is polluted, very likely infects oneself.
上夜班的医生只能早点吃饭，中午接班的医生就早上多吃点，当时网上也说医生不喝水，用尿不湿，都是真的。
Doctors on night shift can only eat early, midday pick-up doctors on the morning, when the Internet also said that doctors do not drink water, with urine is not wet, are true.
医院里等待看病的人。
People waiting to see a doctor in a hospital.
受访者供图三级防护设备依旧稀缺，尸体拖运工作成首要问题剥洋葱：你自己对这次的新型冠状病毒的认识过程是什么样的？王阳：我们医院离汉口、华南海鲜市场其实还是比较远的，隔了一条江，但是病床紧缺，病人就到处辗转医院。
What is your own understanding of the new coronavirus? Wang Yang: Our hospital is still a long way from Hankou and South China Seafood Market, but there is a shortage of hospital beds, and patients have to move from hospital to hospital.
我记得那时另外科室有一个主任说，马上要过年了，要是不把整个武汉的这些病人隔离起来，感染就扩散开了。
I remember that at that time a director of another department said that the New Year was coming, and if we did not isolate all these patients in Wuhan, the infection would spread.
没想到被他说中了。
I didn't think he was right.
剥洋葱：医院从什么时候开始接诊到疑似病人？王阳：应该是在2019年12月中下旬，这样的病人就陆续开始有了。
When does the hospital begin to treat suspected patients? Wang Yang: It should be in mid-to-late December 2019.
1月10日左右我感觉就比较多了，医院的呼吸科基本已经满了。
January 10 or so I feel more, the hospital's respiratory department is almost full.
但是呼吸科满了也不一定都是新冠肺炎病人，每年这个时候是呼吸系统疾病高发季节，可能还收了其他的病人。
But not all respiratory patients are new cases of pneumonia. This time of year is the season for respiratory illnesses, and other patients may be admitted.
我是我们科室接触疑似病人最多的，我们科室的三个疑似病人都是由我来接诊收住院的。
I was the most contact with suspected patients in our department, our three suspected patients are admitted to the hospital by me.
他们都是消化系统症状，有腹泻、不想吃东西、乏力，但都不发热也不咳嗽。
They are all digestive symptoms, diarrhea, do not want to eat, fatigue, but neither fever nor cough.
每个科室都会收到这类疑似病人，他们不是以呼吸症状为首发。
Each unit receives such suspected patients, who do not start with respiratory symptoms.
心慌、胸闷的去心血管科就诊，来消化内科的是腹泻、乏力、不想吃东西，肾内科收治的可能是透析的病人，他们去做透析，但实际上因为抵抗力、免疫力差，已经合并这一类感染了。
Anxiety, chest tightness to the cardiology department, to digest medicine is diarrhea, fatigue, do not want to eat, kidney treatment may be dialysis patients, they go to dialysis, but in fact because of resistance, poor immunity, has merged this kind of infection.
剥洋葱：你们科室的日常接诊能力和防护配备是什么样的？王阳：像我们科室的话，分为一区和二区，总共是50多张床。
Onion peeling: What is the daily receiving ability and protective equipment of your department? Wang Yang: Like our department, it is divided into one zone and two zones, which is more than 50 beds altogether.
消化二区和心血管连在一起，一开始应该是也不主张收这种疑似病人，就怕造成交叉感染，但实际上最后也收了。
Gastrodialysis zone 2 and cardiovascular connection, should not be the first to accept this suspected patient, for fear of cross-infection, but in fact also received.
我们配备就是医务人员普通的白大褂、手套、一次性的医用外科口罩、一次性的外科帽子，顶多算二级防护。
We are equipped with the normal white coats, gloves, disposable medical surgical masks, disposable surgical caps, at most secondary protection.
剥洋葱：从什么时候开始意识到医护人员的防护缺位？现在医院最缺的物资是哪些？王阳：1月10日左右，呼吸科的重症医学科都已经收不完（病人）了，其他科室都陆续收到疑似病例，就跟医院里面申请要三级防护的装备，但是医院里面确实没有，因为这个时候我们医院急诊的病人量已经呈现井喷式的增长，可以说一两千人堵在急诊。
Wang Yang: Around January 10, the other departments of the Department of Respiratory Medicine continue to receive the equipment required for level III protection, but there is no such thing as the number of patients in our hospital emergency service has increased dramatically, so to speak, one or two thousand people are stuck in emergency cases.
据一个病人自己说，早上就去挂号，晚上十一点才能输到液，已经到这样的地步了。
According to one of the patients themselves, it was like that to register in the morning and get the fluid only at eleven in the evening.
三级防护装备优先供应发热门诊、急诊，然后是重症医学科和呼吸内科。
Priority in the provision of level III protective equipment is given to fever clinics, emergency care, followed by intensive medicine and respiratory medicine.
甚至呼吸内科的护士，我看好像也都是戴的外科口罩，也没有N95的口罩。
Even the nurse in the respiratory department seemed to me to be wearing surgical masks as well as N95 masks.
神经内科、心血管科都是这种普通的防护，不是说不想三级防护，是没有。
Neurology, cardiovascular department is this kind of common protection, not to say do not want three-level protection, is not.
现在最缺防护服、护目镜和N95口罩。
Protective clothing, goggles and N95 face masks are most in short supply.
剥洋葱：现在有大量的物资已经运抵武汉了，物资稀缺的情况有缓解吗？王阳： 1月29日，我看到群里发消息，设备科的物资已经不充足了，让科主任、护士长想办法。
Now a lot of materials have arrived in Wuhan, has the scarcity of supplies alleviated? Wang Yang: On January 29th, I saw the news from the group.
剥洋葱：怎么想办法？王阳：之前各个科室的主任、护士长都会动用自己的私人关系，想办法给大家添一点。
Peel onion: How do you think about it? Wang Yang: Before each department director, head nurse will use their personal relations, to find ways to give us a little more.
私底下也收了一些捐赠的，都是不符合医疗标准的，但这个时候，总比没有强，多穿几件、多戴几层。
Private donations are also received, which are not in line with medical standards, but this time, better than no, wear a few more, wear more layers.
还有病人没有戴口罩的，也给他戴一个，也算是保护自己吧。
And if a sick man be not wearing a mask, put one on him, that is to protect himself.
医院里戴着口罩的人在排队。
People in the hospital wearing masks are lining up.
剥洋葱：现在医院里还在一线工作的同事，面临最大的问题是什么？王阳：现在最主要的是尸体处理的问题。
Onion peeling: What's the biggest problem facing our frontline staff at the hospital? Wang Yang: Now the main problem is the disposal of corpses.
以前病人去世，医生护士只需要把仪器从病人身上撤下来，由殡仪馆或者“一条龙”服务的人来处理，都是两个小时内必须拖走。
Once a patient died, the doctor or nurse simply had to remove the device from the patient, and the undertaker or the "train" attendant would have to be towed away within two hours.
现在这种病人殡仪馆要求医院要处理过后才收。
Now this kind of patient mortuary requires the hospital to deal with it before accepting it.
需要怎么处理呢，要喷洒消毒液在尸体上，死者的嘴里、耳朵、肛门，和外界相通的腔道都要用酒精棉球、纱布塞好，用裹尸布把尸体裹两层，最后抬进两层密封的尸袋，再通知殡仪馆。
What is to be done? Spray disinfectant over the body, in the mouth, ears, anus, and the external cavity with alcohol cotton ball, gauze, cover the body with a shroud, finally into the two sealed body bags, and notify the funeral parlour.
但这里面就有两个问题：第一，现在殡仪馆不会马上来拖走尸体，它会集中一个时间点来拖，像医院1月27日的一具尸体，第二天才拖走。
But there are two problems: first, the funeral home will not immediately drag away the body, it will concentrate on a point of time, like the body of a hospital on January 27, and drag it away the next day.
ICU有一天同时好几个病人去世，但是殡仪馆的车也不是马上来，可能人手不够或是其他原因。
ICU one day several patients died, but the funeral parlour car did not come immediately, may not be enough staff or other reasons.
把尸体滞留在医院里这么长时间影响肯定不好。
It must be bad to keep the body in hospital for such a long time.
而且滞留十几、二十个小时也不太安全。
And a dozen or twenty hours is not safe.
处理尸体的医生护士其实心理压力是非常大，如果那天没有男医生的话，几个女医生根本都抬不动尸体，这些操作说起来好像很简单，真正操作起来是非常困难的。
The doctors and nurses who handled the bodies were so psychologically stressed that if there had been no male doctors, the women doctors would not have been able to lift the bodies.
连死者家属都不愿意、不敢帮忙。
Even the families of the dead are reluctant and afraid to help.
医生护士相当于承担了裹尸员的工作。
The doctor's nurse acts as a shroud.
很多清洁阿姨是临时员工，也不来工作了，护士还得承担清洁病区的工作。
Many cleaning aunts are temporary workers and do not come to work. Nurses also have to do cleaning work in the sick area.
我们有同事处理这个真的是心理防线都崩溃了。
We have a colleague dealing with this which is really the psychological defense line has collapsed.
几十名同事疑似感染待确诊剥洋葱：你提到同事疑似感染人数很多，是什么情况？王阳：我们医院，医生护士总数可能在三四百人，这次所有临床医护人员都投入战斗了。
Dozens of colleagues are suspected to be infected with onion peeling: You mentioned the number of suspected infected colleagues, what is itWang Yang: Our hospital, the total number of doctors and nurses may be three or four hundred, this time all the clinical staff are engaged in combat.
医院呼吸内科一直都是满的。
The Department of Respiratory Medicine in hospitals is always full.
但实际上我们每个科室基本上都管了病毒肺的病人，所以医护人员有一大批感染的。
But in fact, each of our departments basically has a viral lung patient, so the medical staff have a large number of infections.
涉及十几个科室，有手术室的、肾内科、整形美容科、门诊、急诊、呼吸科、消化科、神经内科等。
Involved a dozen departments, operating room, renal medicine, plastic surgery, outpatient, emergency, respiratory, digestive, neurology, and so on.
非呼吸科的感染人数反而更多，因为没有三级防护。
On the contrary, the number of infections in the non-respiratory department is higher because there is no tertiary protection.
但没有办法确诊，我们都在等试剂盒。
But there's no way to confirm. We're all waiting for the kit.
抽血、临床症状、血常规、胸部CT这些都只能算是疑似的。
Blood extraction, clinical symptoms, routine blood, chest CT these can only be suspected.
基本上都休息了，有的是回家隔离，有的是在医院留观，比较严重的直接住院。
Basically rest, some home isolation, some in the hospital observation, more serious direct hospitalization.
这个名为“职工感染之家”的群里人数每天都在增加。
The number of people in the group known as the Workers' Home for Infections increases every day.
受访者供图剥洋葱：医院疑似感染的医护人员数量这么多，是接诊了所谓的“超级传播者”这样的患者吗？王阳：不是，我觉得我们交叉感染比较严重。
Interviewees for Onion Stripping: Is the number of hospital staff suspected of being infected so many that they are being treated as "super-carriers"? Wang Yang: No, I think our cross-infection is more serious.
有时候一个医生可能不知道自己已经感染了，都在一个科室里面，值班室是吃睡共用的。
Sometimes a doctor may not know that he is infected, all in a department, duty room is eating and sleeping shared.
我知道的，整形美容科的医生基本都感染了，他们负责承接门诊急诊的任务，所有科室改造成为发热病房以后，门诊就安排好多科室的人，不然看不完。
I know, plastic surgery doctors are basically infected, they take on the task of outpatient emergency care, all sections into a fever ward, the outpatient department on a lot of people, or else look at it.
他们交叉感染比较严重。
Their cross-infection is serious.
现在定点医院又增加了一些，病人缓解一点了，武汉限行了以后也不可能像以前一样井喷似的都往一家医院涌，但之前几个高峰期接诊过大量病人的医院，本身也有个潜伏期。
Now that the number of designated hospitals has increased, the patients have eased a little, Wuhan after the restriction is not as well as before as well as the same as before to a hospital, but the peak of a number of patients before the hospital, there is also a latency.
剥洋葱：被感染的同事，大家关注的是什么？王阳：我们比较关注什么时候能够确诊，现在答复说已经给我们上报了，等待，但没有确切的时间。
Wang Yang: We are more concerned about when we can be diagnosed, and now we have reported it to us, waiting, but there is no definite time.
剥洋葱：过去这段时间你感触最深的是什么？王阳：我是独生子女，我的孩子才一岁半，两边老人身体也都不太好。
Wang Yang: I am an only child, my child is only one and a half years old, and the old people on both sides are not in good health.
医院改造成定点医院前，家人劝我不要出门工作。
Before the hospital was converted into a designated hospital, my family advised me not to go out to work.
但我们主任告诉我，现在就是战场，不能当逃兵。
But my director told me that now is the battlefield, not a deserter.
实际上，我从来都没有想到会有这种进退两难的地步，我就是一个非常普通的人。
In fact, I never thought there would be such a dilemma. I am a very ordinary person.
现在病人太多了，等我康复了以后，如果核酸检测是阴性，我还是要继续在前线的。
There are too many patients now, and when I recover, if the nucleic acid test is negative, I'll still be on the front line.
因为现在我还是医生，就像打仗的兵一样，不能逃避的，虽然我也很害怕。
For now I am a doctor, like a soldier in battle, and cannot escape, though I am afraid.
