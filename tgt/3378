记者/梁婷 实习记者/林亦桥编辑/石爱华 宋建华滞留孝感期间，外卖员搬进合租房2019年底，丁满、李文、张强三人先后选择在武汉做外卖员。
Reporter / Leung Ting Intern / Editor of Lin Yiqiao / Shi Aihua Song Jianhua stay filial piety, take-out staff moved into the end of 2019, Timon, Li Wen, Zhang Qiang three have chosen to work as take-out staff in Wuhan.
此前，他们过得都不如意，有人走弯路进过监狱，有人负债累累，但向往稳定生活的愿望从没改变过。
Until then, they had been unhappy, some had gone to jail, some were in debt, but the desire for a stable life had never changed.
三人把“送外卖”当作2020年的新开始，听人讲，外卖跑得好，一个月万把块不是问题。
The trio regard "take-out" as a new start for 2020, hearing that take-out runs well and a month is not a problem.
当听说孝感赚钱机会比武汉多时，丁满三人主动加入了公司的派遣队伍，在春节支援孝感的外卖业务。
When heard that filial piety than Wuhan more than the opportunity to make money, Timon three volunteers to join the company's dispatch team, in the Spring Festival support filial piety business.
不少同行回家过年时，他们一行三十多人，于1月20日从武汉出发，带着简单的行李，搭上了前往孝感的高铁。
When many of their colleagues came home for the New Year, they set out from Wuhan on January 20 with simple luggage and got on the high-speed train for filial piety.
孝感之行的收入很可观，“工作到正月十五，起码能赚一万块”。
Filial piety travel income is considerable, "until the fifteenth day of work, at least 10,000 dollars."
新冠肺炎疫情的演变，超出了所有人想象。
The New Crown Pneumonia epidemic has evolved beyond anyone's imagination.
1月27日孝感市全市交通实施隔断，在跑单一周后，外卖业务全面叫停，他们被赶出招待所，搬进一间出租屋，开始了漫长的等待。
January 27 Xiaogan City traffic cut off, after a single week, the take-out business, they were expelled from the hostel, moved into a rental housing, began a long wait.
“赚钱计划”变成了孝感出租屋里的“困局”。
The "money-making plan" has turned into a filial "trap" in the rental room.
对于靠打工维生的人，每一个不出工的日子都是煎熬，没钱进入口袋，意味着一家人的生计都没着落，他们很急。
For those who earn their living, every day without work is a torment, with no money in their pockets, which means no livelihood for their families, and they are in a hurry.
孝感街头门店关闭，1月27日起外卖业务全部叫停赚钱从武汉去孝感的原因很简单——趁着过年多赚钱。
Filial piety Street stores closed, January 27 all take-out business stopped making money from Wuhan the reason for filial piety is simple - take advantage of the New Year to make more money.
元旦假期之后，武汉市内84所高校陆续放假。
After the New Year's holiday, 84 colleges and universities in Wuhan have been closed.
近百万学生离开武汉，李文的订单量随之下降，年前几天每天最多只有30单，以往至少也有35单。
As nearly a million students left Wuhan, Li's orders fell, from a maximum of 30 a day in the first few days to at least 35 in the past.
入行3个月的李文听前辈说，孝感每年春节生意都很好，平常一单能挣6元，春节能挣7元，还有200元补助，春节也是平台奖励力度最大的时候。
Li Wen, who has been on the line for three months, said that filial piety is very good every year, usually a single can earn 6 yuan, the Spring Festival can earn 7 yuan, there are 200 yuan subsidies, Spring Festival is also the platform for the strongest reward.
李文细算，若今年过年不回家，在孝感工作到正月十五，能赚一万块。
Li Wen detailed calculation, if this year does not go home, in filial piety until the fifteenth day of the month, can earn 10,000 dollars.
丁满原本就打算春节时留在武汉的站点值班，春节前，站长问他“想不想赚钱”，他很爽快地回答站长，“当然想，过年值班就是为了赚钱。
Before the Spring Festival, the stationmaster asked him if he wanted to make money. He replied to the stationmaster with alacrity, "Of course, the New Year duty is to make money.
”于是，站长给了他一个赚钱的机会——去孝感。
"So the stationmaster gave him a chance to make money - to feel filial.
站长告诉丁满，孝感的外卖业务多由本地人负责，他们春节都不工作，公司决定从武汉调派一批人支援孝感。
Station master told Timon, filial piety of the business is mostly responsible for the local people, they do not work Spring Festival, the company decided to transfer a group of people from Wuhan to support filial piety.
丁满果断答应，除了赚钱，他还想着“作为刚刚入职的新人，在领导面前好好表现一下”。
Timon decisively agreed, in addition to making money, he also thought "as a new recruit, in front of the leadership a good performance."
张强也从站长那里得知孝感每一单的收入比武汉高，他当即决定听从安排，“上面领导说可以多赚点钱，我们想都没想，就答应了。
Zhang Qiang also learned from the stationmaster that filial piety was higher than Wuhan, so he immediately decided to listen to the arrangement.
”所有人都没想过在孝感长待，按照计划，他们1月20日出发，正月十六就能返回。
"No one had expected to stay filial for long. They were scheduled to leave January 20 and return on January 16.
收拾行李时，李文只带了一床被褥、三套衣服和洗漱用品。
When packing, Levin brought only one bedding, three suits of clothes and toiletries.
因为有鼻炎，长时间骑车在路上，灰尘可能导致鼻炎复发，李文随身带了20多个一次性医用口罩。
Because of rhinitis, long cycling on the road, dust may cause a relapse of rhinitis, Li Wen took with him more than 20 disposable medical masks.
丁满和张强从去年12月中旬才开始做外卖员，他们前后投资了几千元置办装备，买电动车的机身花了大几百，租电瓶每月300多元，加上外卖箱、雨衣、防护服、手套，这些看似零散的支出，开销不少。
Timon and Zhang began working as takeaway staff only in mid-December. They invested thousands of dollars to buy equipment, spent hundreds of dollars on the fuselage of an electric car, rented batteries for more than 300 yuan a month, plus takeaway boxes, raincoats, suits and gloves -- all seemingly piecemeal expenses.
不过，对于当时的他们来说，这些投入可以承受，因为在孝感工作20天，他们就有希望工资破万。
But for them at the time, the investment was affordable, because after 20 days of filial piety, they had the prospect of breaking the buck.
1月20日，他们离开武汉前往孝感，包括三人在内，共有30多人去孝感。
January 20, they left Wuhan to go filial piety, including three, a total of more than 30 people to feel filial.
出发前，李文曾听说汉口有肺炎情况，他在火车上一直戴着口罩，但仅仅是预防鼻炎养成的习惯。
Before setting out, Li Wen had heard of pneumonia in Hankou. He had been wearing a mask on the train, but it was just a habit of preventing rhinitis.
到了孝感，丁满看到孝感街道上人很多，少有人戴口罩，一切看似正常平稳。
To filial piety, Timon saw filial piety on the streets, few people wearing masks, everything seems to be normal and smooth.
入住公司安排的招待所后，他们马上开始接单。
After staying in the guest house arranged by the company, they immediately begin to pick up the order.
初到孝感那几天，生意很好。
First arrived filial piety those days, business was good.
1月21号，李文接了40多单，这个数量让他很满意。
On January 21st, Mr. Li took more than 40 orders, which satisfied him.
丁满前五天共跑了159单，是同屋中单量最多的人，但“好生意”随着城市管控通知的发布，很快没有了。
Ding Manchu ran 159 runs in the first five days, making him the largest single person in the room, but "good business" soon disappeared with the announcement of city control.
出租房里没有热水器，洗澡最不方便暂停到孝感两天后，情况发生转变。
No water heater in the rental room, bathing the most inconvenient pause to filial piety two days later, the situation changed.
1月22日，他们入住的招待所开始赶人，这是丁满到孝感以来第一次意识到疫情变得严重。
On January 22, the guest house where they were staying began to move, for the first time since Timon realized how serious the outbreak had become.
丁满记得，那天孝感下了一整天雨，他送完一单，全身湿透，因担心感冒，折回招待所换衣服，还没来得及进屋，招待所的老板便通知他赶紧走，“再不走，我把东西给你们甩出去。
"Timon remembered that it had rained all day under his filial piety. He was soaked through with fear of catching a cold and had to go back to the guest house to change his clothes.
”老板很急也蛮凶，丁满回了句“你不要这样说话”。
"The boss was quick and fierce, and Timon replied," You mustn't talk like that.
他一边联系站点领导，一边和招待所老板争取，得以多住了一晚。
He contacted the site leader and was able to stay an extra night with the hostel owner.
这个50元一晚，两人一间的招待所是他们到孝感后的第一个住处。
This 50-yuan-a-night hostel is their first home after filial piety.
第二天他们被迫换到了另外一家招待所，但1月25号，这家招待所也接到关门通知，几人不得不再次搬走。
The next day they were forced to move to another hostel, but on January 25, the guest house was also closed and several had to move out again.
在站点领导的协调下，他们住到了当地外卖员曾租住的一处房子里。
Under the coordination of the site leader, they moved to a house that the local take-out clerk had rented.
出租房位于一个老旧小区，两室一厅的房子只简单粉刷了墙壁，客厅摆着一张没有床头的双人床，靠墙堆着储存的食材。
The two-bedroom, one-hall house was simply painted, and the living room was furnished with a double bed without a bed and stocked against the wall.
另外两个房间各摆着两个单人床和三个上下铺，窗户边还立着多余的床板遮阳。
There were two single beds and three upper and lower berths in each of the other two rooms, with extra bedplates standing next to the windows.
这间老旧的出租屋后来成为他们的大本营，丁满、李文、张强还有另外三个人住在一起。
The old rented house later became their home. Timon, Levin, Zhang Qiang and three other people lived together.
搬到出租屋以后，孝感市的管控开始严格，商家接到通知，相继关门，他们逐渐没单子可跑。
After moving to rental housing, filial piety began to strict control, merchants were notified, one after another closed, they gradually have no list to run.
年三十那天，李文一早9点出门，到下午三点左右，只送了5单。
On the thirtieth day of 2000, Li Wen left home at 9 a. m. and only delivered 5 tickets at about 3 pm.
结束工作，李文回到出租屋，同事们不在，他睡了一觉，醒来独自出去吃饭。
At the end of his work, Levin went back to the rented room. His colleagues were away.
傍晚，街头行人稀少，餐厅基本是关闭状态。
In the evening, there were few street people and the canteen was largely closed.
李文找到一个夜宵摊，点了一份炒饭和烧烤做年夜饭。
Liwen found a snack stand, ordered a fried rice and barbecue for New Year's Eve dinner.
他有一点想念荆州老家，他知道家里一定备着他最爱吃的鱼糕和糯米丸子，他从没想过第一次在外过年会是这样。
He missed his hometown of Jingzhou a little. He knew his family must have his favorite fish cake and glutinous rice balls with him.
1月27号，社区严格管控进出，外卖工作被彻底叫停。
On January 27th, the community tightly controlled access, and take-out work was completely halted.
1月27日，孝感市新冠肺炎防控指挥部发布10号令：全市交通实施隔断，所有出入道路必须进行物理隔离和设卡进行管制，禁止本地人员外出。
January 27, filial piety city new crown pneumonia control command issued 10: city-wide traffic cut-off, all access roads must be physically isolated and controlled, local personnel banned from travel.
孝感的疫情逐渐蔓延，确诊人数不断增加，成为武汉之外最严重的地区，趁着过年多赚钱的愿望完全破灭。
Feelings of filial piety gradually spread, the number of confirmed people is increasing, become the most serious area outside Wuhan, taking advantage of the New Year to make money completely frustrated.
1月23日，在武汉开始管制时，他们还庆幸来到孝感，逃开了疫情严重地区，现在丁满开始后悔了。
On January 23, when Wuhan began to control, they were glad to have come to a sense of filial piety, fled the epidemic area, now Timon began to regret.
丁满听说，在武汉的同事们还在跑单，每天少说能挣三四百。
Ding Man heard that colleagues in Wuhan are still running single, at least three or four hundred a day.
他常想，如果自己在武汉的话也会去跑单，他不怕肺炎，就怕没有收入。
He often thought that if he was in Wuhan, he would also run a single, he is not afraid of pneumonia, afraid of no income.
现在只能坐着、等着，什么时候可以恢复工作，什么时候可以离开孝感，一切都不知道。
Now can only sit and wait, when can resume work, when can leave filial piety, all do not know.
这身外卖服已经40多天没有穿过了等待在出租屋的日子单调，吃饭之外，几个人就凑在一起玩游戏、看电影。
After more than 40 days without the monotony of waiting in a rented room, several people huddled together to play games and watch movies.
湖北的春天依旧阴冷，大家总冻的打哆嗦。
Hubei spring is still cold, everyone shivering with cold.
白天，大家也盖着棉被蜷在床上休息，那身送外卖的工作服堆在床边，已经很久没有穿上身了。
During the day, people also curled up in bed with quilted quilts. The take-out coveralls were stacked beside the bed and had not worn them for a long time.
困在出租屋初期，李文和同事们还会关注疫情新闻，他们讨论过买不到口罩、感染人数不断上升的问题，也曾痛心李文亮医生的离世。
Trapped in the early stages of rental housing, Mr. Li and his colleagues will also keep an eye on the news, discussing the lack of masks, the rising number of infections, and lamenting the death of Dr. Lee.
但如今他们更关心自己的生活。
But now they care more about their lives.
出租屋没有热水器，没有浴霸，最麻烦的事情就是洗澡，只能用电热水壶烧几壶热水，简单冲洗。
No water heater, no bath bully, the most troublesome thing is to bathe, can only use electric kettle to boil a few pots of hot water, simple rinse.
幸运的是他们有一个室内卫生间，虽然破旧，但已是安慰。
Luckily, they have an indoor toilet, old but comforting.
这段时间，孝感物价上涨明显，他们在孝感的生活开销变大。
This time, filial piety price rises obviously, they are in filial piety living expenses become bigger.
与站点几经协商后，公司愿意承担他们滞留孝感的生活费，但也有明确要求——六人每次买菜不超过200元。
After several negotiations with the site, the company is willing to bear the cost of their stay in filial piety, but there is also an express request - no more than 200 yuan for each purchase.
每隔三五天，几人出去采购一次，一次性买够几天的菜。
Every three or five days, a few people go out shopping and buy enough food for a few days at a time.
大白菜、萝卜、西红柿、芹菜、土豆、鸡蛋是他们的首选，李文解释，出租屋没有冰箱，这些菜的储存时间比较长。
Cabbages, turnips, tomatoes, celery, potatoes and eggs are their top choices, and Li explained that rental housing doesn't have refrigerators and these dishes last longer.
当地的肉价涨到五十多元一斤，他们很少吃。
The local meat price went up to more than fifty yuan a catty, and they seldom ate it.
出租房内的六个人分成两组吃饭，丁满和另外一个会做饭的同事掌勺，一天只吃两顿饭，偶尔饿了，就另外煮碗面条充饥。
Six people in the rented room ate in two groups. Timon and another cooking colleague ate only two meals a day. If hungry, they cooked separate bowls of noodles.
出发前，李文随身带的20个口罩成了“稀缺物资”。
Before setting out, the 20 masks Li took with him became "scarce supplies."
在跑单过程中，疫情扩散，李文又陆续买了50个，他把口罩给同事们分了分，目前还剩十几个。
During the single run, the epidemic spread, Li Wen bought another 50, he gave colleagues points masks, there are still a dozen or so.
因为很少出门，口罩问题他们并不担心，“反正也用不上。
Since they rarely go out, they don't worry about masks. "They don't need them anyway.
”至今，李文和同事已经在孝感滞留了47天，因封城停工的工资补贴“一直在向上申请”，最近他们收到了答复。
Levin and his colleagues have been filial for 47 days now, having recently received a reply to a "constant upward application" for pay subsidies for the closure of the city.
公司承诺，会从三月开始发放一部分补贴到工资卡上。
The company has promised to start paying a portion of the subsidy to its paycards starting in March.
最令李文和同事担忧的问题是，不知道这样没有工作，没有收入的日子还要持续多久。
What worries Mr. Li and his colleagues most is how long it will last without a job or an income.
这份外卖员的工作，对于他们的家庭来说，很重要。
This take-out job is very important to their family.
在武汉坚持送餐的外卖小哥出路在做外卖员之前，李文、张强和丁满人生有各自的不如意。
Wuhan insisted on the take-out delivery of small brother outlet in the take-out before doing, Li Wen, Zhang Qiang and Ding Man life have their own dissatisfaction.
李文做过室内设计和销售，但因为长期熬夜加班、业绩压力巨大，他选择做一段时间外卖员过渡，给自己一个缓冲期。
Liwen has done interior design and sales, but because of the long overtime, performance pressure, he chose to do a period of take-out staff transition, to give themselves a buffer.
入职三个月以来，他从没有好好休息过。
In the three months since he took office, he has never had a good rest.
他计划在这个春节多赚一点，元宵节后再回家过节，往常一个月也就休息一天，这次他计划休息的时间长一点。
He plans to make a little more money for the Spring Festival and then go home for the holidays. He usually has one day off a month.
李文是家中的独生子，他很想多陪陪父母。
Liwen is the only child in his family. He would like to stay with his parents.
张强1987年生人，家里做生意亏了，负债累累。
Zhang Qiang born in 1987, the family business losses, heavily indebted.
几年前父亲去世，母亲一人住在乡下，他还有个四岁的孩子，和妻子分开后，他每个月要给孩子2000元的生活费。
A few years ago, his father died, his mother lived alone in the country, and he had a four-year-old child.
“我们这个年纪上有老下有小，都是家里的顶梁柱。
"We're old and young, and we're the backbone of our family.
”他边工作边还债，每个月也要往家里打钱，对于他来说生活等不起也耗不起，“时间过的太快了，老人老了，孩子也在长大。
"As he worked to pay his debts, he would have to pay his bills at home every month." For him, life was too fast for him to wait.
”他的上一份工作是跟着朋友接工程，为迎接军运会的市政亮化项目做外墙脚手架。
His last job was to follow a friend on a project to build a scaffolding for the military sports meet's municipal lighting project.
到现在，工程尾款还没结完。
So far, the balance of the project is not finished.
工程结束，没了收入来源，考虑到一家老小等着用钱，他开始找事干，“听人讲，跑外卖只要好好跑，肯吃苦，一个月挣万八千的没问题，有的还一万好几千。
When the work was over and he had no source of income, he began to look for work, considering that the family and children were waiting for money.
”他决定把外卖员作为自己人生下一个开始，坚持做一段时间，再寻找新机会。
He decided to take away the salesperson as the next step in his life, to stick to it for a while and look for new opportunities.
外卖员也是丁满给自己寻找的新出路。
Take-out staff is also Timon to find their own new way out.
17岁时，他年少冲动，犯了罪，被判刑12年。
At the age of 17, he was young, impulsive, guilty and sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment.
29岁出来以后，他当过保安，在工厂上过班，洗过酒店的被褥，也开过洗车店，“刚出来的时候没听父母的话，走了一些弯路，俗话说家有1000万，养不起一个劳改犯。
When he came out at the age of 29, he worked as a security guard, worked in a factory, washed the bedding of a hotel, and opened a car wash. "When he first came out, he didn't listen to his parents.
我出来后，也被别人忽悠过。
When I came out, I was fooled by others.
”出狱6年，经历过这些，丁满打算规规矩矩地上班，让父母少操心。
After six years out of prison, Timon plans to go to work regularly, leaving his parents less to worry about.
上一份工作因为老板拖欠工资，丁满辞职了，后来听人说外卖员只要肯吃苦就能赚钱，他决定跑外卖。
Timon quit his last job because his boss was behind with his paycheck. Later he heard that the takeout man would make money if he wanted to, so he decided to take it out.
丁满从去年12月15日开始工作，半个月跑了600多单，当月工资到手4000多元，还完之前的欠款，自己手里剩下不到2000元。
Timon started his work on December 15 last year and ran more than 600 bills in half a month. When he got more than 4,000 yuan in salary, he paid off the arrears before he had to pay, leaving less than 2,000 yuan in his hand.
困在孝感这些日子，丁满不仅没有收入，还得按时上交每月300元的电瓶租金，身上的钱花没有了，他不得已又找家里要了钱。
Trapped in filial piety these days, Timon not only has no income, but also has to pay 300 yuan per month battery rent on time.
三人的窘境也是无数打工族面对的生计问题。
The plight of the three is also a livelihood issue for countless migrant workers.
李文说，相比感染新冠肺炎的人，他们已经是幸运的，但对于每个普通的打工者来说，一年的钱管一年，生计难以维持也是另一种煎熬。
'They're lucky compared to people with new crown pneumonia, but for every regular worker, one year's worth of money is another ordeal, 'says Mr. Lee.
2020年，他们都有一些新的打算，如今疫情尚未结束，只能走一步看一步。
In 2020, they all have new plans, and now the epidemic is not over, just one step at a time.
