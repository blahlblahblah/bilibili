作者 | 刘丹编辑 | 罗立璇设计| 范晓雯列车在武汉站停下，车门没有马上打开。
Ro Lixuan design and service at Wuhan Railway Station. The door did not open immediately.
芮伊整个人绷着，脑子里一片空白。
Rey was a man with a blank mind.
大概过了30秒，门开了。
About 30 seconds later, the door opened.
芮伊跑下车，冲向出站口。
Rey got out of the car and rushed to the exit.
空旷的候车广场里，有人喊，“我们终于回家了！在外面太难受了！”这是武汉“封城”的第8天。
In the open waiting square, someone shouted, "We finally went home! It's too bad outside!" This is the 8th day of Wuhan "closed city."
芮伊从老家返回武汉，票面上的终点是另一个城市，按照疫情爆发前的行车路线，这班车将在武汉站短暂停靠。
Rey returned from his hometown to Wuhan, where the ticket ends in another city and will stop briefly at Wuhan according to the route used before the outbreak.
现在一切都是未知。
Now everything is unknown.
芮伊紧张了一路。
Rey was nervous all the way.
车门不开，她就会被载到一个陌生的城市；车门开了，就意味着她将在武汉度过没有亲人陪伴的抗疫期。
If the door was not opened, she would be taken to a strange city, and if the door opened, it would mean that she would spend the unescorted period in Wuhan.
决定这一场“逆行”的原因是，家里的猫正在武汉等着芮伊回来。
The reason for this "retrograde" is that the family cat is waiting in Wuhan for Rey to return.
很多人在离开武汉之前，对已经悄然发生、即将大规模爆发的疫情毫不知晓。
Before leaving Wuhan, many people were unaware of the impending outbreak, which had already occurred quietly.
封城之后，宠物留守在武汉的家中，生命随着断水断粮进入倒计时，逼他们审视自己能为拯救这些弱小生命投入多少成本。
After the city was sealed, pets stayed at home in Wuhan, and life began to count down as water and food ran out, forcing them to see how much they could spend on saving the tiny lives.
而他们本身也是被审视和衡量的对象。
And they are themselves subject to scrutiny and measurement.
在疫情的恐慌下，与武汉这座城市的交集让他们成为被人群边缘化的异类。
In the panic of the epidemic, the intersection with the city of Wuhan has made them an outlier marginalized by the crowd.
比起留在老家被隔离，芮伊宁愿陪在宠物身边，“生命是需要被平等对待的。
Rather than remain isolated at home, Rey would rather stay with a pet. "Life needs to be treated equally.
”就像一张网，“封城”“封路”以及关于抗疫的种种举措，兜起了“人命关天”的大局，而微小个体的遗漏和掉落往往需要相同处境的人去打捞，他们的命运也互为参照。
Like a net, "closed" and "closed" and anti-epidemic initiatives, the "human life" of the overall situation, and the omission and fall of small individuals often need to the same people to salvage, their fate cross-reference.
逆行大年三十晚上，芮伊脑子里只有一个想法：我要回武汉。
On the thirtieth night of the Chinese New Year, Rey had only one idea in mind: I'm going back to Wuhan.
几乎是寸步难行。
It's almost impossible.
1月23日凌晨两点左右，武汉正式宣布“封城”，暂时关闭全市离汉通道。
January 23 around 2 a.m., Wuhan officially announced the "closure" of the city, temporarily closed the Han corridor.
当天上午10时，铁路部门关闭武汉地区所有铁路火车站进站通道。
At 10 a.m. on the same day, the railway authorities closed all Wuhan railway stations access to the station.
“封城”后，出逃武汉的故事屡屡见诸报端，而芮伊却越来越想回去。
After "sealing the city," the story of fleeing Wuhan has repeatedly been seen in the press, but Rui more and more would like to go back.
离开武汉前，她把猫留在家里，请朋友帮忙照看，家里也配备了自动饮水机、喂食机，以及摄像头等装备。
Before leaving Wuhan, she left the cat at home and asked her friends to take care of her. The family was also equipped with automatic drinking fountains, feeding machines and cameras.
突如其来的疫情和封城让假期延长，打乱了她原本的安排。
The sudden outbreak of the epidemic and the blockade prolonged the holiday and disrupted her original plans.
她又紧急联系了楼下宠物店上门喂猫。
She contacted the pet store downstairs to feed the cat.
几天后，宠物店的人告诉她，猫咪变得烦躁，打翻了家里的东西，出现了明显的异常行为。
A few days later, she was told by pet shop owners that the cat had become irritable, overturned its belongings and displayed obvious abnormalities.
芮伊有预感，疫情不会在十天半个月内结束，而在这短短几天时间里政策已经变了又变，她实在不放心长时间把猫放着不管。
Rey had a hunch that the outbreak would not end in half a month in ten days, and that policy had changed and changed in a matter of days.
“如果这期间猫生病了，而我不能及时回去，那我一定会后悔的。
"If the cat gets sick in the meantime and I can't get back in time, I'll be sorry.
”想回武汉照顾宠物的不止芮伊一人，她在一个养猫群里发现了有相同想法的猫友们，大家一商量，做了两个方案：如果途径武汉的各班高铁仍会在武汉站停车，那么他们可以在停车间隙冲下车去；要么，几个人先去往周边城市，然后搭伙包车回到武汉。
"Rey is not the only one who wants to go back to Wuhan to take care of his pets. She found like-minded cat friends in a group of cats.
芮伊还算幸运，她买到途径武汉的高铁，顺利下车，和几个同在武汉站的猫友一起包车回家。
Rui is lucky to have bought a high-speed train through Wuhan, got off the train without a hitch, and chartered home with a few of her cat friends at Wuhan.
而有的群友直接是从武汉周边的黄陂、鄂州等地骑行几十公里回到市区，为了猫。
Some of the group friends directly from Wuhan surrounding Huangpi, Huizhou and other places to ride dozens of kilometers back to the city, for cats.
猫不是这种“逆行”的唯一动力。
Cats are not the only motivator for this retrograde behavior.
芮伊老家以“硬核”的疫情防范工作著称，她所在的小区里也张贴了各种宣传告示。
Renee, who is known for her hard-core preventive work, has put up posters in her neighborhood.
一回到家，芮伊就自行隔离，家里来人她就躲进屋子里，不想别人知道自己是从武汉回来的，“朋友们知道我回来了之后都不怎么敢和我讲话，还有人开玩笑说要举报我。
As soon as he got home, Rey kept himself isolated, and when the family came she hid in the house, not wanting anyone to know that she was from Wuhan. "Friends knew I wasn't going to speak to me much when I came back, and people joked about reporting me.
”这种“特殊待遇”让芮伊觉得不公平，她宁愿回武汉和猫待在一起，“你对人善良，人不一定对你善良。
"This special treatment made Rae feel unfair. She would rather go back to Wuhan to spend time with the cat.
但你对自己的猫好，它真的也会对你好。
But you are good to your cat, and it really will be good to you.
你养猫的时候可能不会想要它回报你什么，但猫有时候会带给你一些惊喜。
When you have a cat you may not want it to reciprocate, but a cat can surprise you sometimes.
回家看到它们，至少会有个心理安慰。
There's at least some psychological comfort in coming home to see them.
”▲留守武汉的猫因为打上“武汉”这一标签而在外地遭受的差别对待，留在武汉的人感同身受。
Wuhan-left cats because of the label "Wuhan" suffered from the difference in treatment in the field, those who stayed in Wuhan feel the same.
宠物店老板周默原本计划1月22日带着他养的秋田犬去云南玩，狗的寿命不过十几年，周默想让小狗多看看风景。
Pet shop owner Zhou Mo had planned to take his Akita dog to Yunnan on January 22. The dog's life span was less than a decade.
那时候武汉还没有封城，但钟南山已经明确表示了新型冠状病毒肺炎存在人传人现象。
Wuhan had not been closed at that time, but Zhong Nan Shan has clearly expressed the existence of the new coronavirus pneumonia human-to-human phenomenon.
他担心会给别人添麻烦，于是取消了旅行计划。
Fearing that he would cause trouble to others, he cancelled his travel plan.
“出门都不敢咳嗽，一咳嗽别人就会害怕。
"If you go out and cough, people will be afraid.
”周默家里经济条件不差，开宠物店不是为了赚大钱，而是为了方便照顾他养的十几只猫猫狗狗。
Zhou's family is financially sound, and the pet store is not set up to make big money, but to take care of his dozen cats and dogs.
开店三年，周默看着一些宠物长大，也看着一些客人成家，宠物变成了人和人之间的连接，“我对人和对宠物都有很长时间的感情在这，所以店还是要开下去。
After three years in the store, Zhou Mo watched some pets grow up and others found homes. Pets became connections between people. "I have a long-standing relationship with people and pets here, so the store has to keep going.
”公交停运、私家车禁行，出行不仅麻烦，还有感染风险。
"Bus stops and private cars are off limits, making travel not only troublesome but also a risk of infection.
周默每天骑着摩托车上门送货，最远的一次来回各40公里。
Zhou Mo every day on the motorcycle door-to-door delivery, the furthest back and forth each 40 kilometers.
疫情面前，狗还有没有粮吃、猫还用不用得上猫砂，对于周默来说仍然重要。
In the face of the epidemic, dogs still have food to eat, cats still need not use cat sand, for Zhou Mo is still important.
“不养宠物的人不太会理解我们的心情。
"People who don't have pets don't understand how we feel.
”并不是所有人都理解这种价值排序，在疫情的恐慌下，部分弱势群体是可忽略甚至可牺牲的。
Not everyone understands this sort of hierarchy of values, and some vulnerable groups can be ignored or even sacrificed in the panic of the epidemic.
根据网友爆出的消息，有宠物在主人被隔离期间被带走深埋，还有宠物疑似被主人从楼上抛下。
Some pets were taken to the ground while their owners were quarantined, while others were suspected to have been dumped by their owners, according to netizens.
网络图片显示，黑龙江讷河市等地为防控疫情，曾决定对流浪猫狗进行捕杀。
Network pictures show that Heilongjiang River city and other places in order to prevent and control the epidemic, has decided to stray cats and dogs.
“歧视”是周默反复提及的一个词，要么是表达他对动物的担忧：“本来很多人就歧视动物，这次疫情还和野生动物有关，不明真相的人可能听风就是雨。
"Discrimination" is a word Zhou used repeatedly, or to express his concern about animals: "A lot of people have discriminated against animals. This outbreak is also related to wild animals. People who do not know the truth may hear the wind or the rain.
”要么是说如今外地人对武汉人的态度，“我一天到晚都能看到武汉人在外地被歧视的新闻，你们不能这样子好吧？我们其实做了很大的牺牲。
"Or the attitude of outsiders to Wuhan people nowadays," I see news of Wuhan people being discriminated against in other places all day long.
”互助1月25日，大年初一。
Mutual Aid January 25, the first day of the New Year.
周默的宠物店里死了两只小猫和一只狗。
Two kittens and a dog died in Chou Mo's pet shop.
这天上午，武汉市新型肺炎防控指挥部发布了第9号通告，宣布26日0时起，除经许可的车辆外，对中心城区区域实行机动车禁行管理。
This morning, the Wuhan New Pneumonia Prevention and Control Command issued Circular No. 9, announcing that from 0000 hours on the 26th, motor vehicles would be banned in the central city area, except for permitted vehicles.
“封路”不止阻断交通，也切断了很多生命与外界的联系。
Road closures not only cut off traffic, but also cut off many lives from the outside world.
“别说是猫狗了，要是有老人自己住，没人去送饭也可能饿死。
"Don't say cats and dogs. If an old man lives on his own, nobody will send a meal or die of hunger.
”要抢时间，周默慌了。
"To seize the time, Zhou was silent.
人手本来就不够，两家店只有他和一位员工照看，每家店处理铲屎、喂食、遛狗等日常工作就要花上四五个小时。
He and an employee were the sole caretakers, spending four or five hours in each shop shoveling, feeding and walking the dog.
“封路”打乱了工作安排，他想着二店寄养的宠物少，让员工先照看一店，自己赶紧出去送货。
"Road closure" disrupted work arrangements, he thought of the second store foster care for fewer pets, let the staff first look after a shop, rushed out to deliver goods.
一出门就耗到了夜里。
It took the night to get out.
晚上回来的时候，他还想去囤点青菜，去了之后发现超市只剩肉了。
When he came back at night, he also wanted to hoard some vegetables, and when he went there, he found only meat left in the supermarket.
周默跑了一天，累得不想说话，也没顾得上去店里看看，结果那三只小动物就不行了。
After a day of running, Chou Mo was too tired to talk or bother to go to the shop. As a result, the three little animals did not work.
“是我们的责任，但我们也确确实实迫于无奈，哪想到突然就这样了。
"It's our responsibility, but we're really forced into it, and we don't know how to think of it.
”“封路”让留守宠物救助变得更为急迫。
"Road closures" make staying-at-home pet relief even more urgent.
也是在25日，武汉小动物协会微信后台的求助留言越来越多，负责人杜帆觉得，现在不能再犹豫了，“紧要关头我们必须得要撑起这个责任。
Also in the 25th, Wuhan Small Animals Association micro-letter backstage help messages more and more, the director of Du Fan felt, now can not hesitate, "We have to support the critical moment we have to support this responsibility.
”“为什么要到处去传播病毒？”“人都管不了，还管猫干什么？”武汉小动物保护协会是武汉唯一在市民政局备案、拥有“合法身份”的民间救助组织。
"Why do you want to spread the virus everywhere?" "Nobody cares, what the cat does?" Wuhan Association for the Protection of Small Animals is the only non-governmental relief organization in Wuhan that has a "legal status" on file with the municipal civil affairs bureau.
他们平日里的流浪动物救助工作就时常遭遇误解。
Their daily rescue work for stray animals is often misunderstood.
质疑的声音在遇到疫情后变得更加尖锐。
The voices of doubt have become more acute in the wake of the epidemic.
▲武汉街头的流浪狗对协会成员勋哥来说，救猫是大事。
Wuhan street dog to the Association of Brother, cat rescue is a major event.
1月31日这天，杜帆和勋哥等人救下了一只黑猫，勋哥通过这件事感受到了“有史以来最难受又最兴奋的心情”。
On January 31, Du Fan and other men saved a black cat, through which Brother felt "the most miserable and exciting mood in history".
猫确实是难救，救下之后勋哥特别有成就感。
Cats are really difficult to save, after the brother especially a sense of achievement.
它被困在15楼的阳台上，身子卡在窗和窗栏的间隙，随时可能因为体力不支坠楼。
It was trapped on the fifteenth floor balcony, stuck in the gap between the window and the window sill, and could fall because of lack of physical strength.
流浪猫无法通过楼下的门禁，结合那几天盛传的“宠物也会感染新型肺炎”，勋哥立马就明白了：这是一只被扔出门的家猫。
Cats can not go through the door downstairs, combined with the days of the popular "pet will also be infected with the new pneumonia," Schoener immediately understand that this is a house cat thrown out the door.
为了救猫，杜帆去到楼顶，脚踩着围栏边缘，上半身探出栏杆外，抛下绳子套住猫，勋哥站在楼道里，用晾衣杆撑着猫接应。
In order to save the cat, Du Fan to the roof, feet on the edge of the fence, the upper body out of the railing, throw down the rope to catch the cat, brother stood in the corridor, with a clothes pole to support the cat to answer.
但其实只要15楼的住户愿意拉开窗子，猫就可以跳进房间。
But as long as the occupants of the 15th floor are willing to pull the window open, the cat can jump into the room.
屋主不愿意，说家里还有两个孩子。
The owner of the house refused to say that he had two children.
猫获救，窗子开了，屋主拿着一瓶消毒水不停地喷着窗台。
The cat was rescued, the window opened, and the owner of the house kept squirting at the window sill with a bottle of disinfectant.
“作为一个想保护孩子的母亲，她只是选择性地相信了自己认为是正确的东西”，勋哥试图去理解屋主的行为，但还是觉得委屈，“他们家门上还挂着一个五好家庭的牌子，为什么遇到事情直接拒绝沟通呢？”关于猫狗等动物的生命价值有很多评价标准，比如是否构成威胁、家养还是流浪，比如品种、血统、价格。
"As a mother who wanted to protect her children, she only selectively believed what she thought was the right thing to do." Schoener tried to understand the behavior of the owner, but felt aggrieved.
有的狗用来比赛，有的狗可以吃掉。
Some dogs play games and some dogs can eat them.
即使是由爱或者善意驱动的行为，也时常与某些价值排序并行，并在疫情中变得更加突出。
Even acts motivated by love or goodwill often go hand in hand with certain values and become more pronounced in epidemics.
也有不少人为了让自己的宠物优先获得救助而瞒报信息。
There are also many people who conceal information in order to give priority to their pets.
杜帆心里不太舒服，“希望大家都能够如实说吧，给更多宠物一个平等的救助机会”。
Tu Fan in the heart is not comfortable, "I hope that we can tell the truth, to give more pets an equal opportunity to rescue."
还有对他人的漠视，“明明人在武汉，离放猫的房子就两站路，他怕被感染，说家有老人小孩，自己不去让我们去，我不知道他心里是怎么想的。
There is also disregard for others, "Obviously people in Wuhan, two stops away from the cat's house, he is afraid of infection, the speaker has old children, do not let us go, I do not know what he thought.
”其实救助不止是关于某个人某件事。
"It's not just about somebody.
“如果不去救这些猫狗的话，它们可能真的会死在家里，而且会造成二次的疾病传播。
"If they don't save the dogs and cats, they may actually die at home and cause a secondary spread of the disease.
”杜帆通常用这个理由说服小区物业放他们通行，这些小区严加防控，往往是因为已经存在确诊病例。
Tu Fan usually uses this argument to persuade small-area properties to let them pass, which are tightly controlled, often because confirmed cases already exist.
但救助又确实可以只是个体之间的相互关心。
But relief can indeed be a matter of mutual concern between individuals.
范丽娜1月19日从武汉回老家的时候把猫也带回去了，自己的猫安置好后，她开始操心起别人的猫，帮着微信群友们收集救助信息。
When Vanessa returned home from Wuhan on January 19th and took her cat home, she began to worry about other people's cats and help her small group of friends collect rescue information.
“我想我的猫好，我也想所有的猫好。
"I think my cat is good, and I want all cats to be good, too.
”25日晚上8点，距离“封路”还有4小时，范丽娜收到群友求助，说自己人在青山区，想把猫从光谷区接回身边。
"At 8pm on the 25th, four hours before the road was closed, Vanessa received a call from her friends that she was in the mountains and wanted to bring the cat back from the Valley of Light.
这时已经很难找到车了。
It was hard to find the car by this time.
范丽娜想起有位邻居最近在做志愿者接送医护人员出行，于是联系他帮忙。
Vanessa thought of a neighbor who had recently volunteered to take the paramedics on the road and contacted him for help.
等这位司机师傅去接猫，已经是晚上10点40分。
It was 10: 40 p. m., when the driver went to pick up the cat.
到了小区楼下，保安把师傅拦在门外。
When we got to the ground floor, the security guard stopped the master outside.
范丽娜和朋友轮番打电话求情，总算把猫接了出来。
Vanessa and her friend took turns making phone calls and managed to pick up the cat.
标准由人建立，以人的意志为转移。
Standards are built by man and shaped by his will.
宠物医院的老板张寻发现，武汉街头多了很多流浪狗，有不少品种狗也被抛弃了。
Zhang Hing, the owner of the pet hospital, found that there were many stray dogs on the streets of Wuhan, and many kinds of dogs were abandoned.
“很多人还是把宠物当作好玩的东西，觉得狗的命不重要。
"Many people still think of their pets as funny things and don't think the dog's life is important.
”张寻的医院去年才开业，目前还没盈利，估计要两年才能回本。
Zhang's hospital, which opened only last year, is not yet profitable and is expected to return for two years.
1月29日发布的《武汉市新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情防控暂行办法》要求宠物商店(医院)暂停营业。
The Provisional Measures for the Prevention and Control of Pneumonia from the New Coronavirus Infection in Wuhan issued on January 29 require pet shops (hospitals) to suspend business.
张寻的店不对外营业，但还是会有员工留守，希望遇到需要急救的动物还能救一下。
Zhang's shop is not open to business, but there will still be staff left behind, hoping to encounter animals in need of first aid can still save.
有些不需要复杂仪器的基本治疗，张寻就开着车上门，“很多人电话打过来，能跑的我们一定跑。
Some do not need the basic treatment of complex instruments, Zhangqin drove to the door, "a lot of people call, can run we must run.
”开宠物店之前，张寻利用业余时间做过五六年的流浪动物救助工作。
Before opening a pet shop, Zhang spent five or six years doing rescue work for stray animals.
那时候更多是去菜市场和狗贩子较劲，稍不及时，就会有狗被当场宰杀。
At that time, more to go to the vegetable market and the dog traders, slightly untimely, the dog will be killed on the spot.
扯皮、打架，被逼急了还有人亮刀子。
Scratching, fighting, getting pissed off and some bright knives.
张寻也知道他们的救助行为其实处在模糊地带，但国内又没有相关的小动物保护法。
Zhang also knows that their rescue is actually in the vague zone, but there is no relevant domestic animal protection law.
“矛盾爆发出来，就只能靠自发的力量，自己想办法去解决。
"Conflicts erupt, can only rely on the power of initiative, their own way to solve.
”透支在可以预见的持久抗疫和不可预见的政策变化中，钱是眼下为数不多的能够被计算的问题。
Overdraft Money is one of the few things that can be calculated right now in the midst of predictable and protracted epidemics and unforeseen policy changes.
对于在武汉养宠物的人来说，原本过年期间寄养一周，花费不过500元左右，随着假期延长，寄养变成了无底洞。
For those who keep pets in Wuhan, the original foster care during the New Year, the cost of about 500 yuan, with the extension of holidays, foster care into bottomless hole.
找人上门喂养，每次的费用大多也要100元以上，这还不算开锁费和车费。
Find a person door-to-door feeding, the cost of most also want more than 100 yuan, this is not including the cost of lock-out and car.
范丽娜这几天都活跃在救助群中，看到猫友群里有个女孩说家里的猫只剩5天口粮，她就帮着联系开锁匠和喂猫人。
Vanessa, who has been active in the help group for days, saw a girl in the group who said her cat had only five days left to feed, and she helped contact the locksmith and the cat breeder.
“封城”之后，武汉市上门开锁的价格涨到了300-800元。
"Seal the city", Wuhan after the door to unlock the price rose to 300-800 yuan.
听到开锁师傅的报价后，这个女孩没再回复范丽娜的消息。
Hearing the quotation from the lock-maker, the girl did not reply to Vanessa.
又过了几天，范丽娜突然发现，这个女孩还在群里犹豫，说猫已经断水了，但她想等到断粮后再找人开锁。
A few days later, Vanessa suddenly noticed that the girl was still hesitating in the group that the cat had run out of water, but she wanted to wait until the food was gone before finding someone to unlock it.
范丽娜气得删掉了这个女孩，“她都不着急，我急什么？”宠物店也陷进了望不到尽头的消耗中。
Vanessa angrily deleted the girl, "she did not worry, I hurry what?" Pet shop is also trapped in endless consumption.
已经有两三个人不回张寻的消息了，原定的寄养服务已经到期，他们还没把钱结清。
Two or three people haven't returned their calls, and the foster care service has expired and they haven't settled the money yet.
“如果只是过年回家寄养一个星期，费用也就五六百，现在你不知道会寄养多久，个把月下来可能得三四千。
"If it's just a week to go home for a week, the cost is five or six hundred. Now you don't know how long it will take.
”有能力提供上门服务的宠物店不多了。
Not many pet shops are able to provide on-site service.
周默估计，武汉1/3的宠物店都撑不过今年。
Mr. Zhou estimates that one-third of Wuhan's pet stores won't last this year.
他店每天房租和工资等支出就得7000块钱，账上的资金维持不到两个月。
His shop was paid seven thousand dollars a day for rent and wages, and had less than two months' worth of money on its books.
商场的私人租户们拉了个群，想找找获得补贴或者租金减免的办法，周默心里清楚，希望不大。
Private tenants at the mall are rallying around for a way to get a subsidy or rent rebate, knowing that there is little hope.
类似的事在周默的经验里早有答案。
Such things have long been answered in Zhou's experience.
比如现在，没有口罩就要出门去买，但相关部门又规定了出门必须戴口罩。
For example, now, without a mask to go out to buy, but the relevant departments and regulations must wear a mask.
还有去年要求办狗证，大型犬没证要罚，罚了之后又不给办证。
Also last year to request a dog card, large dogs do not have a license to punish, after the fine and not to do so.
周默想来想去，只剩一句感慨，“要是领导也喜欢狗就好了。
Chou Mo thought and thought, only one sentence left sigh, "If only the leader also liked the dog.
”留守宠物的生存将更加危急，但能全力投入救助的人可能越来越少。
The survival of pets left behind will be more precarious, but fewer and fewer people will be able to devote themselves to it.
伊万是民间救助组织“武汉土猫”的创建者之一。
Ivan is one of the founders of the non-governmental relief organization "Wuhan earth cat."
根据伊万的介绍，通过群友互助等方式，她们已经解决了400多个求助，但力量仍然太小。
According to Ivan, they have solved more than 400 requests for help, including through group help, but they are still too small.
前两天，包括伊万在内，群里陆续有人接到了在家办公的通知。
Two days ago, including Ivan, the group of people have been receiving home office notification.
杜帆原以为真正需要上门救助的应该只有50家左右。
Du Fan thought that the real need for home help should be only about 50.
但仅在26日武汉小动物保护协会公众号的文章发出当天，后台就立刻收到300多条求助信息，现在协会已经完成帮扶400家，被登记在册待解决的还有500多家。
But only on the day of the publication of the Wuhan Society for the Protection of Small Animals' Public Number on the 26th, more than 300 requests for help were immediately received backstage, and the association has now helped 400 of them, with more than 500 registered for settlement.
目前他们有两个工作人员负责整理求助信息、处理后台数据，同时还有6个志愿者，两人一组，分别上门进行汉口、武昌，汉阳三地留守动物的救助。
They now have two staff members, one for help and the other for backstage data, and six volunteers, in teams of two, to help the animals left behind in Hankou, Wuchang and Hanyang.
人手不够，他们又建立了互助群，让求助人自己在群里对接相关资源。
In short supply, they set up a support group, allowing the helpers themselves to dock the relevant resources in the group.
“力不从心”，杜帆说道。
"It's beyond my capacity," Du said.
而且，在“救命”的紧迫感之下，不同的人对怎么救、什么是“救”，有不同的理解。
Moreover, under the sense of urgency of "saving life," different people have different understandings of how to save and what is "to save."
疫情爆发后，老猫是对救助需求反应最迅速的民间救助人之一。
After the outbreak of the outbreak, the old cat is one of the most rapid response to the relief needs of the people.
1月25日，老猫的推送《这是一条紧急推送 | 留守武汉的猫咪，你们的食物和水还够吗？——我们提供上门接猫服务，请快点联系我们，不然就来不及了》在短时间内阅读量突破10万。
This is a cat emergency & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45
有个女孩看到这篇文章后，付了寄养费和路费，让老猫把自己留在武汉家中的猫接回寄养。
When a girl saw this article, she paid for her foster care and travel expenses, and asked the old cat to take the cat back to her home in Wuhan.
随后她发现网上传出老猫会在救助后转手卖猫的消息，于是联系老猫，希望他每天发一下猫的视频或者照片，结果老猫非常愤怒地打来电话，认为她没有尊重自己所冒的风险，“既然你觉得我可能会把你的猫卖钱，那咱们就谈钱。
When she found out that the cat would resell the cat after the rescue, she contacted the old cat, hoping that he would send out a video or picture of the cat every day.
300块钱路费不够，现在武汉市封路，随便出门干个什么都是500块钱起步。
Three hundred yuan road fare is insufficient, now Wuhan city closes the road, go out casually to do anything is 500 dollars to start.
”事后老猫坦承，那天他救助太累了，心力交瘁，所以没能保持足够的理智。
"The cat confessed afterwards that he had been so tired and exhausted that day that he had not been able to stay sensible enough.
但信任由此断裂，女孩要求老猫将猫送回，而老猫忙于救助，要求对方自己将猫接走，两人互不让步，“封城”“封路”让事情进一步陷入僵局。
But trust broke, the girl asked the old cat to return the cat, while the old cat busy with the rescue, asked the other side to take the cat away, the two did not give in, "closed the city" and "blocked the road" further stalemate.
▲救助人上门为猫准备的水和粮老猫在武汉“猫圈”是个争议性人物，被指责“挑着品种猫救”、“打着救猫的旗号卖猫”，还有寄养条件差让猫被染上猫瘟等。
The cat pen is a controversial figure accused of carrying a breed of cat to save, of selling cats under the banner of saving a cat, and of having poor foster care to infect cats with rinderpest.
但老猫认为自己采取的是商业化模式，通过救助赚钱来维持长期的救助，“让挨饿的猫少一点”。
But the old cat sees itself as a commercial model, making money out of rescues to sustain long-term relief "by making fewer cats hungry."
这段时间，老猫说自己一个人就已经解决了近200条求助信息，上门喂养每次收费200元，寄养50元一天，同时根据情况收取油费和开锁费用。
Meanwhile, the cat said it had solved nearly 200 calls for help alone, charging $200 for door-to-door feeding and $50 a day for foster care, as well as fuel and lock-out fees, depending on the situation.
他有更高的效率，但也在透支个人能力，以更大的损耗为代价去救“命”。
He is more efficient, but he is also overdrawn with personal ability to save "life" at the expense of greater losses.
至少在成为被牺牲的“小部分”后，衡量其中的得失就不再是简单的加减法。
At least when you become a "small part" of what has been sacrificed, measuring the gains and losses is no longer a simple addition or subtraction.
郑真曾是老猫的支持者，却在几天内对老猫的态度迅速变为厌恶。
Zheng Zhen, a former cat supporter, quickly developed an antipathy to the old cat within days.
她的朋友在年前捡到一只流浪猫，并送到老猫手里寄养。
Her friend picked up a stray cat a year ago and sent it to an old cat for foster care.
这让郑真对老猫印象很好，在救助群内几乎一边倒地骂老猫的情况下，坚持替老猫说话。
This made Zheng Zhen very good impression of the old cat, in the rescue group almost one-sided abuse of the old cat, insisted on speaking for the cat.
群友质疑老猫为什么不辟谣关于他的“黑料”，郑真反问，“是澄清重要还是救猫重要？”朋友过年回老家后一直自行隔离，情绪低落，顾不上跟进小猫的情况。
Friends questioned why the cat did not rumor about his "black material", Zheng Zhen rhetorically asked, "Is it important to clarify the importance or save the cat?" Friends returned home after the New Year has been isolated, depressed, rather than follow-up kittens.
再和老猫联系的时候，朋友被告知，猫在被送过去的第二天就死了，老猫说这些天忙于救助，没及时通知她。
When he contacted the cat again, the friend was told that the cat had died the day after he had been sent to the cat.
“如果我可以早点知道他的事情，如果我们能多警惕一些，如果我们早一点问他的情况，可能猫还好好的，失去生命的教训我不会忘记，再次抱歉。
'If I had known about him sooner, if we had been more vigilant, and if we had asked him earlier, the cat might have been well, and the lessons of life lost.
”郑真在求助群里留下一长串道歉的话，退出了群聊。
Zheng Zhen left a long list of apologies in the help group and dropped out.
救助是对弱小生命的善意，但这些善意正在经受更多拷问。
Relief is goodwill to the weak, but it is being subjected to more torture.
尽管拷问可能本不需要存在。
Although torture may not need to exist.
更多的宠物被抛弃，更多的流浪动物陷入危险，但张寻手头上的救助工作却少了。
More pets are abandoned and more stray animals are in danger, but Zhang is having less help at hand.
从前积极的救助人士大多被疫情拦在家里，张寻明白，现在自保是第一位的，不能搞道德绑架。
Former active rescuers are mostly blocked by the epidemic situation at home, Zhang found out that self-insurance is the first, can not engage in moral kidnapping.
就像他自己，能力范围也不过是以他的宠物医院为圆心打转，半径又因为车辆限行、小区严控不断缩小。
Like himself, the range of his abilities is limited to the center of his pet hospital, and the radius is shrinking because of traffic restrictions and strict cell control.
“环境的改变是需要时间的，需要全社会去参与，靠一两个人根本不够。
"Changing the environment takes time and requires the participation of society as a whole, and one or two people is not enough.
”话虽如此，张寻还是不想让自己闲下来，又报名了所属片区的抗疫志愿者，“能做多少做多少吧，哪怕去搬一块砖。
Having said that, Zhang did not want to be idle and signed up for the anti-epidemic volunteer in his district. "Do as much as you can, even if you move a brick.
”最让张寻放心不下的还是那些流浪动物。
"It was the stray animals that worried Zhang most.
留守的宠物尚且有人关注，在更偏僻的角落，更多的流浪动物还在寂静中，无人知晓。
There are concerns about pets left behind, and in the more remote corners, more stray animals are still in silence, unnoticed.
