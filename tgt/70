如果我爸真的不行了，因为没有确诊的条件，他最后都是一个“疑似病例”，我们都不能确定是不是这次新型冠状病毒的原因。
If my father really can't, because there is no diagnosis, he is a "suspected case," we are not sure whether the new coronavirus is the cause.
口述 | 冯红实习记者 | 岳颖 记者 | 王珊我家在湖北黄冈，家里有四口人，父母、弟弟和我，我们一家人全是疑似病例。
AT RATE & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; &
我爸双肺全被感染，医生说肺部都白了，根据CT的影像图片，基本上可以判断是新型肺炎，但是医院没有试剂盒子，不具备确诊条件，所以诊断为“疑似”。
My father's lungs were infected, the doctor said the lungs are white, according to CT images, can basically be identified as a new pneumonia, but the hospital did not have reagent boxes, did not have the diagnosis conditions, so the diagnosis is "suspected."
从感染到现在，我们已经签了两次病危通知书。
From the moment of infection to the present, we have signed two death notices.
我妈的情况稍微轻一点，但也被留在医院隔离。
My mother's condition was slightly less serious, but she was also kept in isolation in the hospital.
我和弟弟情况又好一些，所以被安排在家里隔离。
My brother and I were better off, so we were placed in isolation at home.
我想了好久都不清楚我们一家怎么被感染的。
I've been thinking for a long time about how our family got infected.
我爸妈今年都50岁，我爸之前住过一次院，母亲有糖尿病，但身体总体来说还可以。
My parents are both 50 years old and my father lived in a hospital once before. My mother has diabetes, but her health is generally good.
仔细回想，出现情况可能是在1月7日，那天我和爸妈开车去武汉，接上大学的弟弟放假回家。
In retrospect, it could have happened on January 7, when my parents and I drove to Wuhan to pick up my college brother for the holiday.
我和爸妈早上逛了一个商场，距离华南海鲜市场不到两公里的距离，因为快要过年了，人挤人，后来我们就离开了。
My parents and I visited a shopping mall in the morning, less than two kilometers from the South China Seafood Market.
我们那时完全不知道武汉出现了新型肺炎，也没在街上和商场里看到有人戴口罩。
We had no idea that Wuhan had a new type of pneumonia, and we did not see people wearing masks on the streets or in shopping malls.
之后，我们又去了一个市场，才去武昌接了弟弟回家。
After that, we went to a market, just went to Wuchang to pick up my brother home.
回来一两天后，我爸爸就开始咳嗽、发烧、浑身无力，吃不进去饭，四五天之后，呼吸变得困难。
After a day or two back, my father began to cough, feverish, limp, unable to eat, and after four or five days, his breathing became difficult.
所有人都认为他只是得了普通感冒，但看他情况越来越严重，我们就去当地的卫生院拍了片子、输液。
Everyone thought he was suffering from a common cold, but as his condition got worse, we went to the local clinic for a picture and an infusion.
家里人觉得他可能得了普通的肺炎，有些紧张。
The family felt that he might be suffering from ordinary pneumonia and was nervous.
卫生院的医生也没有把他的病和这次的新型肺炎联系到一起，就按照普通肺炎来治疗。
The doctors at the clinic did not link his illness to the new pneumonia, and treated him with ordinary pneumonia.
输液几天，我爸情况更不好了。
After a few days of infusion, my dad was worse off.
我想也许是当地的医疗条件不够好，就在1月19号带他去了黄冈市最好的三甲医院——黄冈市中心医院做检查。
I thought maybe the local medical conditions were not good enough, so on January 19th I took him to Huanggang Central Hospital, the best triple-A hospital in Huanggang City.
当天结果就出来了。
The results came out the same day.
黄冈市中心医院说这种情况需要住院，并且需要马上转进ICU病房，就派了救护车把他接过去。
Huanggang Central Hospital said the situation required hospitalization and an immediate transfer to the ICU ward, so an ambulance was sent to take him.
但是在去往医院的途中，他们接了一个电话，又说不能收治了，我们只能把爸爸送回家里。
But on the way to the hospital, they answered a phone call and said they couldn't take him back. We had to take him home.
这天我们也给妈妈做了检查，她在我爸出现症状三四天后有了同样的症状，只不过程度比较轻。
We had a test on my mother that day, and she had the same symptoms three or four days after my dad's symptoms, but to a lesser extent.
结果显示我妈也被感染了。
It turned out my mom was infected, too.
我和弟弟当时基本没啥症状，自己也感觉比较健康，但医生说由于我们都和父母有密切接触，所以也要排查。
My brother and I were mostly asymptomatic and felt healthier, but the doctors said we had close contact with our parents, so we had to do some research.
检查之后，我们也被列为疑似病例。
After the examination, we were also listed as suspected cases.
我已经结婚了，从武汉回来就没和父母一起住，所以情况最轻。
I have been married, back from Wuhan did not live with their parents, so the situation is the least.
弟弟每天送我爸去打针，情况比我差。
My brother gives my father an injection every day. It's worse than me.
之后，我们去了同济黄州医院，医院拒收。
After that, we went to Tongji Huangzhou Hospital, which refused to accept it.
我们又去问黄冈市中医医院，依然不收，他们的说法都是只能等卫健委发话才能收治。
We went to ask Huanggang City Chinese Medicine Hospital, still do not accept, their statements can only wait for the health committee to speak to the treatment.
黄冈只有这几家好医院，我们实在没办法，只能一直恳求医院。
The only good hospitals in Huanggang, we really have no choice but to keep pleading with the hospital.
终于，有一个特别好心的副院长自己做了主张，说，“这个病人我收了。
At last, a particularly kind-hearted vice-dean made up his mind and said, "I have the patient.
”我爸爸妈妈这才住进了医院。
"My parents lived in the hospital.
住进黄冈市中医医院之后，我才知道，不是医院不愿意收治病人，而是他们真的没有床位。
After being admitted to the Huanggang Hospital, I learned that it was not the unwillingness of the hospital to admit the patients, but the fact that they had no beds.
这个医院本来都没有呼吸感染科，是临时成立了科室，腾出了一些楼层来收治病人，医生也是临时调过来的。
The hospital, which did not have a respiratory infection unit, was set up on an ad hoc basis, freeing up floors for patients, and doctors were transferred on an ad hoc basis.
我爸待在一个普通的隔离病房。
My dad stayed in an ordinary isolation ward.
现在医疗资源这么紧缺，我也能够理解。
I can understand that medical resources are so scarce now.
但是我和医生说过，如果我爸爸危重了，一定要马上转到ICU，医生答应了我的。
But I told the doctor that if my father is in serious danger, he must be transferred to ICU immediately. The doctor promised me.
从1月20号到现在，我父母住院已经5天了。
My parents have been in hospital for five days since January 20th.
妈妈有所缓解，爸爸却越来越严重，呼吸很困难，吃饭和大小便也不能自理，都是妈妈在照顾。
Mother is relieved, but the father is more and more serious, breathing is very difficult, eat and urine can not take care of themselves, are mother.
我觉得挺难过，如果我爸真的不行了，因为没有确诊的条件，他最后都是一个“疑似病例”，我们都不能确定是不是这次新型冠状病毒的原因。
I feel sad, if my father really can not, because there is no diagnosis of the conditions, he is a "suspected case," we are not sure is not the cause of the new coronavirus.
昨天晚上，我突然接到妈妈的电话，说她被转到另一家医院了，设施非常简陋。
Last night, I got a phone call from my mother saying that she had been transferred to another hospital and that the facilities were very basic.
转移的具体原因，她也不清楚。
The exact reasons for the transfer were not clear to her.
妈妈被转院之后，谁来照顾爸爸是一个很大的问题。
Who will take care of the father is a big problem after the mother is transferred to the hospital.
医院的救护人员都非常忙，没人能照顾他，只能由家属来照顾，所以我弟弟准备去。
The hospital attendants were so busy that no one could take care of him. They had to be cared for by his family, so my brother was going.
他问医生，“陪护家属能不能穿和医生一样的防护服？”医生回答说，“没有。
He asked the doctor, "Can the accompanying family wear the same protective clothing as the doctor?" The doctor replied, "No.
”他问，“那会不会再次交叉感染？”医生也很无奈地跟我们说，“医院人手不足，如果你要陪护，就不要怕感染，不然就不要陪护。
"Will it cross-infect again?" the doctor told us helplessly, "The hospital is understaffed.
”可是，如果我们不去照顾爸爸的话，有谁能来照顾他呢？从妈妈被转移之后，爸爸为了减少上厕所的次数，已经不怎么吃东西了。
But who can take care of him if we don't take care of himDad hasn't eaten much since his mother was transferred to the bathroom.
我和弟弟在家自己隔离。
My brother and I are isolated at home.
除了必要的出行和买药，我们都尽量待在家里。
We tried to stay at home, except for the necessary trips and medicines.
我爸爸是一个人缘非常好的人，很多人给他打电话。
My father is a very popular person and a lot of people call him.
但是我都尽量劝下了，爸爸现在一直带着氧气面罩，说话比较困难。
But I tried to persuade him. Dad was wearing an oxygen mask all the time and talking was difficult.
其实医生也说我需要多休息，但是我现在每天都焦头烂额，和医院联系、和政府联系、和各种亲戚联系。
In fact, doctors said I needed more rest, but now I'm struggling to get in touch with hospitals, with the government, with relatives.
自从知道了父亲感染上这个病，我每天都非常紧张，每次签病危通知单，紧张又加剧一层。
Ever since I learned that my father had contracted the disease, I was nervous every day. Every time I signed a critical notice, the tension increased.
我现在每天都要去药店买免疫球蛋白，医生告诉我们这个有用，可以增强免疫力。
I now go to the drugstore every day to buy immunoglobulin, and the doctors tell us that it works and boosts immunity.
全家人都要注射，要一万多块钱。
The whole family needs an injection. Ten thousand bucks.
这种蛋白医院没有，药店也很难买，有时候我要跑好几家才能买到。
This protein hospital doesn't exist and drugstores are hard to buy. Sometimes I have to run several families to get them.
这种蛋白，药店说买的人很多，560一瓶，第二天我去就涨到了720一瓶，现在560的已经买不到了。
This protein, pharmacies said to buy a lot of people, 560 bottles, the next day I went up to 720 bottles, 560 is not now available.
买完的免疫球蛋白就被送到医院，医生会在上面写上病人的名字和床号，之后为病人注射。
The purchased immunoglobulin is sent to the hospital, where the doctor writes down the patient's name and bed number and then injects the patient.
在1月19号之前，黄冈街上还没什么人戴口罩，之后越来越多，现在几乎所有的人都戴上了口罩。
Until Jan. 19, few people were wearing masks on Wanggang Street, and more and more people are now wearing them.
医院内的患者家属互相都没有交流，大家都怕交叉感染。
The families of the patients in the hospital did not communicate with each other and everyone was afraid of cross-infection.
医生们的防护也更加严实了。
The protection of the doctors has also been tightened.
我们一开始去医院时，医生只戴了口罩，现在防护服和护目镜都用上了。
When we first went to the hospital, the doctor was wearing only a mask, and now the suit and goggles are in use.
我跟弟弟打算在家里再观察一下情况，如果一直没有发烧和咳嗽的话，我们就去医院复诊。
My brother and I were going to look over the situation at home, and if there had been no fever or cough, we would go back to the hospital.
不知道，这样是不是代表我们就痊愈了？其实我们也不清楚。
I don't know. Does that mean we're all healed? We don't know.
有一天我们在打针的时候，一个人过来也要打这个蛋白，他并没有感染，只是想做预防。
One day while we were doing the injection, a man came over to hit the protein, he was not infected, just wanted to do prevention.
除了注射蛋白，我和弟弟本来按照医院的要求一直在服用奥司他韦，但是我刚刚刷微博才知道这种药对新型肺炎并没有用。
Except for the protein injection, my brother and I had been taking oseltamivir at the request of the hospital, but I had barely begun to understand that the drug was not working with the new pneumonia.
那我和弟弟的病情现在属于什么情况？除了注射蛋白增强免疫力我们还能做什么？我感到很无力。
So what is the condition of my brother and I? What else can we do but inject protein to strengthen immunity? I feel powerless.
医务人员身着防护服接诊（中新社供图）现在黄冈已经确诊12例，我也没有试图联系过他们。
Medical staff in protective clothing (CNS feed) have now confirmed 12 cases in Huanggang, and I have not tried to contact them.
医生都说现在没有试剂盒子，那他们是怎么确诊的？我不知道。
Doctors say there's no reagent box, so how did they diagnose it? I don't know.
每天除了处理家里的事，我就一直在微博上刷这次疫情的消息，现在网上很多人都对武汉很畏惧，这次报道会不会又让大家害怕黄冈？我很想把我爸爸转到更好的医院，但现在的政策是“当地发现，当地治疗”。
Every day, in addition to dealing with the family business, I have been on Weibo to brush this epidemic news, now that many people on the Internet fear Wuhan, this report will make people fear Huanggang? I would like to transfer my father to a better hospital, but now the policy is "local discovery, local treatment."
我相信政府，相信医院。
I believe in the government. I believe in hospitals.
