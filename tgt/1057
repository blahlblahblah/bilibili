”疫情之下，尽管已经关闭中国半数汉堡王门店，但其母公司RBI并未打算放缓在中国扩张的脚步。
In the wake of the outbreak, RBI, the parent company, has no plans to slow its pace of expansion in China, even though it has already closed half of its Burger King stores.
餐饮连锁巨头RBI集团（Restaurant Brands International）近日披露了其2019年第四季度及全年财报。
Restaurant giant Restaurant Brands International recently disclosed its fourth quarter 2019 and full-year results.
财报显示，得益于包括中国在内市场的增长，汉堡王2019年全球新开约1000家门店达到11500家，全球门店数增长约10%，全球同店销售额增长5%。
Burger King has opened around 1,000 new stores worldwide in 2019, up about 10 per cent on a global scale and 5 per cent on the same front, thanks to growth in the market, including China, according to the results.
不过另一方面，中国市场的疫情也很有可能对其2020年财务成绩造成一定影响。
On the other hand, the Chinese market is likely to have an impact on its financial performance in 2020.
RBI集团旗下拥有汉堡王、Popeyes、Tim Hortons三家全球性餐饮连锁，其中汉堡王目前在中国拥有超过1300家门店，咖啡连锁Tim Hortons拥有超过30家门店，Popeyes去年宣布正式登陆中国，计划2020年在上海开出中国首店。
Among the three global restaurant chains owned by the RBI group -- Burger King, Popeye and Tim Hortons -- Burger King currently has more than 1,300 outlets in China and the coffee chain Tim Hortons has more than 30 outlets.
疫情之下，汉堡王目前已经关闭中国半数门店。
The Burger King has now closed half of its stores in China in the wake of the outbreak.
仍营业的门店与很多餐企的做法类似：鼓励人们用自动点餐机点餐，外卖时鼓励消费者采取无接触配送的方式。
The stores that remain open are similar to those used by many restaurants: people are encouraged to order their meals using automatic ordering machines, and consumers are encouraged to take out food in a non-contact manner.
在财报披露后的投资者电话会中，RBI集团CEO Jose Cil称，2019年，中国地区汉堡王的销售额占集团整体销售额的2%，“现在谈疫情的影响还为时过早，我们时刻在监控当下的事态发展。
In a post-disclosure investor call, CBI CEO Jose Cil said Burger King's sales in China accounted for 2% of the group's overall sales in 2019. "It's too early to say what the impact of the epidemic is.
”至于RBI旗下的另一品牌Tim Hortons，目前来看，由于该咖啡连锁在中国仍处于扩张阶段，门店数占全球总门店数的比例较小，且疫情期间大多Tim Hortons仍然营业，因此疫情造成的同店销售额波动对于整体集团的影响并不大。
As for Tim Hortons, another RBI brand, so far the impact on the group as a whole is small because the chain is still expanding in China, the number of stores in the world is small and Tim Hortons is still in business for most of the epidemic.
界面新闻观察到，上海地区的Tim Hortons疫情期间均有开业，同样建议消费者采用外卖或自取的方式消费，在外卖订单的小票中，也注明了工作人员每日的体温和健康状况。
The Interface News observed that the Tim Hortons epidemic in the Shanghai area was operating during the epidemic, and similarly advised consumers to consume by take-out or take-out, with daily body temperature and health status indicated in small tickets for take-out orders.
不过，RBI第四季度财报显示，以加拿大为主要市场的Tim Hortons增速并不理想。
But fourth-quarter results from the RBI said Tim Hortons, which is based in Canada, didn't grow as fast as it should.
2019年第四季度，Tim Hortons同店销售额下跌4.3%，2019年全年同店销售额则下跌1.5%，主要由于加拿大本土市场成绩不佳。
In the fourth quarter of 2019, same-store sales fell 4.3%, compared with 1.5% for all of 2019, largely because of poor results in Canada.
Jose Cil表示，从去年十月起他有约60%以上的时间都在加拿大工作，为Tim Hortons找到新的增长办法、并且招募更多在数字化和营销等方面有能力的新员工。
Jose Cil says he has spent more than 60% of his time working in Canada since last October, finding new ways to grow Tim Hortons and recruiting more new employees with skills in areas such as digitization and marketing.
“过去60天里我们在加拿大做了Tim Hortons近20年以来规模最大的消费者调研，”Jose Cil说，“试着去了解加拿大消费者如今都把钱花在什么地方。
"Over the past 60 days we've done the biggest consumer research in Canada in almost 20 years by Tim Hortons," Jose Cil said. "Try to understand where Canadian consumers are spending their money these days.
”而对于RBI集团旗下的炸鸡连锁Popeyes而言，原本定于今年上半年在上海开出首店的计划，客流和销量多少会受到疫情影响。
As for the RBI group's fried-chicken chain Popeye, passenger flow and sales could be affected by plans to open its first store in Shanghai in the first half of the year.
但RBI集团表示对中国市场的消费潜力仍然抱有信心，“去年我们的特许经营方帮汉堡王在中国开出了300多家门店，而我们的目标是未来十年在中国开出1500家Popeyes门店，我们相信它在中国这一全球最大的鸡肉消费市场，会具有巨大潜力。
But the RBI group says it remains confident about the potential for Chinese consumption: "Last year our franchisee helped Burger King open more than 300 stores in China, and our goal is to open 1,500 Popeye stores in China over the next decade, and we believe it has great potential in China, the world's largest chicken market."
