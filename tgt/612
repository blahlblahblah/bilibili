点击上方物质生活参考加星标！物质生活参考作者：彭梁洁来源：wzshck（ID：物质生活参考）赵平和冯安，武汉一对年逾60的夫妻，妻子赵平先感染，因为医院床位不足，只能自行居家隔离，丈夫冯安随后也被感染。
2007-9-19 16: 55 [hide] Zhao Ping and Feng An, Wuhan couple more than 60 years old, contracted the infection because their hospital beds were insufficient and they had to live in isolation, and her husband Feng An was infected.
身在武汉，他们是为数众多的，等不到床位、无法确诊、甚至没有资格计入统计数字的人。
In Wuhan, they are numerous, unable to wait for beds, unable to diagnose, or even eligible for the statistics.
他们没有从医生口中听到“确诊”两个字，但心里明白“就是那个病”。
They didn't hear the word "diagnosed" from the doctor's mouth, but they knew it was the disease.
夫妻俩每天早出晚归，忍着病痛，在医院排队10个小时等待输液治疗。
The couple spent 10 hours in the hospital waiting for an infusion after going out early and coming home late every day.
第二次照CT，赵平情况更严重了，医生告诉她必须住院，但本院没有床位了，去其他几家医院看，人更多，“算了”。
The second time according to CT, Zhao Ping's condition is more serious, the doctor told her to be hospitalized, but the hospital did not have beds, to see several other hospitals, more people, "forget.
每一个疲倦的夜晚回到家中，只能祈求自己的身体早日驱走病魔，好在还有彼此的手可以握。
Every tired night back home, can only pray for their bodies to exorcise the disease, fortunately there are hands to hold each other.
为了不传染给孩子们，在自己还走得动的情况下，夫妻俩坚持不肯让孩子来照顾自己。
In order not to infect the children, in their own mobile situation, the husband and wife insisted that the children do not take care of themselves.
保护孩子，这是全天下父母的本能。
It's a universal instinct to protect our children.
打电话的时候，主要是赵平在描述情况，丈夫冯安在一旁时不时补充几句，或者纠正一些说法，这让我产生一种错觉，对方明明正在经历残酷的折磨，但听他们的语气，平静得如同在讲述一件平常之事，那个可怕的病在他们的描述中就像一场普通的治疗——每天去医院输液，回到家努力生活。
When I called Zhao Ping, it was mainly Zhao Ping who was describing the situation. My husband, Feng An, added a few words from time to time or corrected some remarks, which gave me the illusion that the other party was going through a cruel ordeal, but their tone was calm as if telling a normal story.
但正是这种平静更让人揪心和震惊。
But it is this calm that is even more disturbing and alarming.
以下是患者赵平自述：我是1月8号出现发热症状的，吃了三天退烧药没降下去，心想不对，自己已经好多年没发过高烧了。
The following is the patient Zhao Ping self-described: January 8 I had fever symptoms, took three days of antipyretics did not go down, think wrong, they have not had a high fever for many years.
这才联想起来，华南海鲜市场关闭前一天我去过那里两趟，买了点基围虾，之前对这个事情真的不太了解。
This reminds me that I went there twice the day before the South China Seafood Market closed and bought some prawns, something I didn't really know about before.
我赶紧去家附近的武汉市中心医院就诊。
I hastened to the Wuhan Central Hospital near my home.
做了CT，第三天拿到片子，诊断结果是肺部感染，不能确诊是不是那个病。
CT, the third day to get the film, the diagnosis is pulmonary infection, can not be diagnosed is not that disease.
医生让我居家隔离，每天去医院输液治疗。
The doctor isolated me at home and went to the hospital for infusion every day.
我不是武汉本地人，因为孩子们在武汉工作定居，我跟爱人退休之后也移居武汉。
I am not a native of Wuhan, because the children work and settled in Wuhan, my wife and I retired and moved to Wuhan.
房子买在武汉市中心医院附近，公交就一站地，主要就是考虑到我们两个岁数大了，以后就医方便。
The house in Wuhan City Central Hospital near the public transport station, mainly taking into account that we are two years old, the hospital will be convenient.
没想到才搬来一年多就遇到这种事。
I didn't expect this to happen more than a year ago.
中心医院看病的人太多了。
There are too many people attending the central hospital.
在医院排队，一等就是一整天，周围的餐馆很多关门了，只能自己带点面包蛋糕之类的点心，但真的吃不下，晚上原封不动带回去。
Standing in line at the hospital for a whole day, the surrounding restaurants were closed and they had to bring their own cookies, such as bread cakes, but they couldn't eat them and took them home as they were at night.
得病之后，我全身没劲，一点食欲都没有，只能天天吃流食，主要是银耳汤，喝粥连咸菜都咽不下去。
After the illness, I have no energy, no appetite, can only eat daily flow of food, mainly silver ear soup, congee can not even swallow pickled vegetables.
但是排队需要能量啊，我问医生，医生说实在不行，你就在牛奶里尽可能多放糖。
But queuing takes energy, I asked the doctor, the doctor said that really can't, you put as much sugar as possible in the milk.
到现在半个多月的时间，我瘦了15斤。
I have lost 15 kilos in more than half a month.
我爱人想让我多休息一会儿，每天早上五点起床去门诊排队，我八点再过去，一般排到下午两三点才能开到针剂，拿到药之后再去排队输液，又要等几个小时，打上吊瓶都下午五六点了，输液差不多两小时，最晚一次晚上11点才回家。
My wife wants me to rest a little longer. I get up at five in the morning to go to the clinic. I get in line at eight o'clock. I don't usually get an injection until two or three in the afternoon.
我问医生能不能一次开三天的针剂，这样后两天就可以直接去排队输液，医生说没办法，规定不能这样。
I asked the doctor if he could prescribe an injection for three days at a time so that he could go straight to the infusion for the next two days.
孩子们要来照顾我，帮我排队，我拒绝了，这里全是病人，千万不能传染给他们。
The children to take care of me, to help me line up, I refused, this is full of patients, must not infect them.
我在医院看到有个老太太，孩子去医院送饭，她简直暴跳如雷，把东西扔了，把孩子骂走，让孩子下不来台。
I saw an old lady in the hospital. The baby went to the hospital to deliver food. She was so mad that she threw the things away and scolded the baby out of the way.
做父母的，我理解那种心情。
Parent, I understand that feeling.
我现在还动得了，就坚决不给孩子们添麻烦。
Now that I can move, I'm determined not to cause any trouble to the children.
他们来送生活用品，都让他们放在门口，不开门，等他们走了再出去拿。
They came to deliver the things they wanted, put them at the door, did not open the door, and waited for them to leave before they went out to get them.
23号武汉封城。
Wuhan Seal 23.
公交车停运之后，我每天只能走去医院。
After the bus stopped, I had to walk to the hospital every day.
因为实在是没力气，平时十分钟的路程要走半小时，我随身带着一个塑料小板凳，累了就坐在路边歇一会，勉强能走到。
As I had no energy, I walked for half an hour on the usual ten-minute walk. I took a small plastic stool with me, and when I was tired I sat down by the side of the road for a while, barely able to reach it.
在医院排队，这个也是必备的，大家几乎人手一个，不然真的是撑不住。
Queuing in the hospital, this is also a must, we almost a hand, or really can not sustain.
医院把大门封了，只留了个小门。
The hospital closed the door except for a small one.
之前排队都排到大街上去了，估计是怕影响不好，工作人员让大家在医院里排队，病房、走廊，犄角旮旯全部挤满了人。
Before queuing up to the street, presumably for fear of bad impact, staff in the hospital line, wards, corridors, corner all crowded.
不允许人们拍照。
People are not allowed to take photographs.
现在病人比我刚查出来那会儿多多了，主要是老年人，年轻人也有，一家人全部感染、一起来就诊的情况很常见。
There are more patients now than when I first found out, mainly elderly people, but also young people, and it is common for a family to get infected and come together.
除了发热门诊，其他科室全关了。
Except for the fever clinic, all the other departments were closed.
听医院的人说，专家都调去汉口医院了。
People who listened to the hospital said that the experts had been transferred to Hankou Hospital.
因为病人不断在增加，前几天还是两个病室，最近增加了一个，一共三个病室，三个医生坐诊。
As the number of patients continued to increase, the previous few days had been two rooms, recently added a total of three rooms, three doctors sitting.
他们看起来很年轻，好像是实习医生，诊断不太熟练，有一次我们拿着方子去取针剂，取药处发现少了点东西，我们又回去补开。
They looked very young, like interns, not very proficient in diagnosis. Once we took Fang Zi to get the injection. The medicine department found something missing and we went back to make it up.
每个病室只能坐30来个人，病室外的人只能自己举着吊瓶，还有人用一根棍子支着，等里面的人输完液、空出一个位置才能进去坐。
Only about 30 people could sit in each room, and those outside had to carry their own pins, while others held it up with a stick until the occupants of the room had emptied their fluid and made room for themselves.
一共就两个护士，一个打针一个拔针，那么多人，忙得停不下来，真的是很不容易。
A total of two nurses, a shot to draw a needle, so many people, too busy to stop down, is really not easy.
我感染之后差不多一个星期之后，我爱人也被感染了。
Almost a week after my infection, my wife was infected.
他比我大几岁，身体素质比我好一点。
He is several years older than me and is in better health than I am.
一开始我们就比较注意，吃饭的碗分开，两个人说话也保持距离，家里的马桶消毒，一人睡一个屋，但两口子在一个屋里住，怎么可能完全隔离呢？现在两个人都感染了，算了，也不避讳了。
At first we paid more attention to the separation of the bowls for eating, the distance between two people talking, the disinfection of the toilet at home, the single person sleeping in the same room, but the couple living in the same room, how can it be completely isolated?
他去医院检查之后，就在小区附近的一家诊所输液。
After he went to the hospital, he had an infusion in a clinic near the neighborhood.
我看了，跟医院的药是一样的，都是消炎和抗病毒的。
I saw, and the hospital medicine is the same, are anti-inflammatory and anti-viral.
医院人太多了，我也想转去诊所输液，但是诊所那个大夫说，你一开始去了医院，就别转过来了，这边人也满了。
There are so many people in the hospital and I want to transfer to the clinic for infusion, but the doctor at the clinic said that as soon as you first go to the hospital, don't turn around.
诊所那个大夫也不容易。
The doctor at the clinic wasn't easy either.
本来就只有一个大夫一个护士，后来护士走了，可能是怕传染吧，只剩大夫一个人忙前忙后，又要开药又要打针，每天看七八十个病人。
There was only one doctor and one nurse, and then the nurse went away, probably afraid of infection, leaving the doctor alone after the busy, but also to prescribe medicine and injection, every day to see seventy patients.
大年三十儿前一天是诊所最后一天开门，她也要回家过年了，病人们都求她不要走，她也没办法，人家坚持到这时候已经很对得起我们了。
New Year's Eve opened the day before the last day of the clinic, she will also go home to celebrate the New Year, patients begged her not to leave, she can not, they insisted on this time we have been very worthy.
她走之前说正月初六开门，我们前两天去看，还没来，不知道是什么情况。
Before she left, she said that the door was open at the beginning of January, and we had been there two days before.
第一次做CT之后，我在医院连续输了9天液，23号又做了一次CT，显示病情加重了。
After my first CT scan, I lost nine days of fluid in a row at the hospital, and a second CT scan on the 23rd showed that my condition had worsened.
医生跟我说，我这种情况必须住院，但医院没有床位。
The doctor told me that I had to be hospitalized, but the hospital had no beds.
他建议我去汉口医院试试，我们过去一看，人更多，只能放弃。
He suggested that I try Hankou Hospital, we went to see more people, can only give up.
又听别人说附近的铁十一局医院也能收病人，这是个小医院，我们抱着希望去了，队伍也排到了大街上，现在哪还有人少的医院呢。
It was a small hospital, and we went there with hope, and the line was lined up in the street. There is not much hospital now.
12日诊断报告15日诊断报告孩子们一直在联系床位。
12 diagnosis report 15 diagnostic report The children have been in contact with the bed.
之前我高烧到40度，孩子打电话求助社区派车送医院，社区没有回复，后来社区主动联系我们，说可以派车接送，但床位要自己找，加上我的烧退了，也不满足接送条件了。
I had a high fever of 40 degrees and the community did not respond to my child's call for a car to the hospital. We were contacted by the community and told that we could send a car, but the bed had to be found by myself and my fever was gone.
说实话，住院还是要有关系，不然进不去的。
To tell you the truth, hospitalization is still a matter of concern, or you can't get in.
我们在这里人生地不熟，真的是没办法。
We don't know much about life here, we can't help it.
我认识两个人也是得了这个病，因为有关系才给安排入院。
I know two people who also got the disease, because of the relationship to arrange for admission.
还听说有个患者的儿子实在急得没办法，只能跑到上面去闹，才安排了床位。
Also heard that there was a patient's son really anxious, had to run to the top of the scene, just arranged the bed.
我们岁数大了，闹不动，更不想连累孩子们，还是继续去门诊排队吧。
We are too old to stir, not to mention the children, or continue to go to the clinic queuing.
那个诊所放假以后，爱人就跟我一起在医院就诊，天天早出晚归。
After the clinic closed, my wife and I went to the hospital together and came home early and late every day.
1月29号，我感觉发热慢慢降下来一点，担心医院人多又交叉感染，就让医生给我开了5天的口服药，打算回去自己在家吃药，先看看情况再决定下一步怎么办。
On January 29th, feeling a little feverish and worried about the large number of people in the hospital and the cross-infection, I asked my doctor to give me an oral medication for five days.
但不知道像我已经退烧了，会不会再复发？退烧了就代表好转了吗？我也不知道。
But I do not know like I have a fever, will it relapse again? Fever on behalf of the improvement? I do not know.
看病的钱目前都是自己承担，一般门诊除了规定病种，医保都不报销，只能等以后看上面有什么方案吧。
The money that sees a doctor is oneself at present, general clinic besides stipulation disease type, medical insurance is not reimbursed, can only wait to see what plan has above.
今天（2月1号）我胃口恢复了一点，能吃得下一点面条了，但身体还是没劲，想扫一扫客厅，扫了一半感觉喘不上气，只能坐下来休息。
Today (Feb. 1) I regained my appetite and was able to eat some noodles, but my body was still languid and I tried to sweep the living room.
爱人的烧还没完全退，需要继续去医院打点滴。
The lover's fever has not completely retired, need to continue to go to the hospital drip.
昨天他去门诊排队取针剂拿到500多号，晚上走之前只排到230多号，他等不了先回家了，今天早上又去才取到药，估计医生们也是在连夜工作，真的很辛苦。
Yesterday he went to the clinic to pick up the injection to get more than 500, before leaving at night only to row 230, he could not wait to go home first, this morning to pick up the medicine, it is estimated that the doctors are also working at night, really hard.
好在今天去医生终于同意开了3天的针剂，可以少排一个队，明后天直接去排输液的队就行了，节省了不少时间。
Fortunately, today, the doctor finally agreed to open a three-day injection, you can cut a queue, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow directly to the infusion team, save a lot of time.
他今天是7点多出门的，现在已经12点多了，刚刚跟我说还在排队。
He went out more than 7 o'clock today, and now it's past 12 o'clock. He just told me he was still in line.
真不知道我们这个队还要排多久。
I don't know how long our team will be waiting.
