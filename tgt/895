特约撰稿 邹黄晶 本报记者 石英婧 荆州、上海报道2020年1月24日，农历除夕，湖北省荆州市宣布，自中午12时起，暂时关闭荆州火车站离荆通道；24日17时前，暂时关闭市区所有公交车、道路客运班线车、旅游包车、农村客运车辆、渡口渡船。
Jingzhou, Hubei Province, announced that since 12: 00 noon, Jingzhou Railway Station is temporarily closed from the Bauhinia Pass. Before 17: 00 pm on the 24th, all buses in the city, road buses, tour buses, rural passenger vehicles and ferry boats were temporarily closed.
荆州，地处新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎（以下简称“武汉肺炎”）暴发地——武汉西南方向，两地相隔约240公里。
Jingzhou, located in the new coronavirus infection pneumonia (hereinafter referred to as "Wuhan Pneumonia") outbreak - southwest of Wuhan, two places about 240 kilometers apart.
这也是继武汉、鄂州、仙桃、枝江、潜江、黄冈、赤壁、荆门、咸宁、黄石（含大冶市、阳新县）、当阳、恩施、孝感13个城市区域公共交通停运后，湖北省内第14个“封城”的城市。
This is the 14th "closed" city in Hubei Province after the suspension of public transport in 13 urban areas, including Wuhan, Huizhou, Xiantao, Zhijiang, Huanggang, Red Cliff, Jingmen, Xianning, Huang Shi (including Daye City, Yangxin County).
《中国经营报》记者走访中了解到，随着武汉“封城”的消息像冲击波一样，逐渐对荆州产生辐射影响。
"China Business Daily" reporters interviewed learned that as Wuhan "closure" news like the shock wave, gradually had a radiation impact on Jingzhou.
口罩脱销、酒店团席取消、许多人连夜高价拼车赶回荆州.....而一些荆州籍贯打工族在回湖北前则会被要求提交体检报告，并在当地按时按要求汇报身体状况。
Many workers from Jingzhou are required to submit medical reports before returning to Hubei, where they report their medical condition on time.
1月24日下午6时许，《中国经营报》记者致电荆州市疾控中心公众咨询电话进行采访，对方回复称：“荆州市疫情数据发布一切以国家卫健委官网为准。
January 24 around 6 p.m., the China Business Daily reporters called Jingzhou CDC public consultation telephone interview, the other side replied: "Jingzhou epidemic data release all based on the National Health Officers' Network.
”火车站停运前：口罩脱销、酒店取消团年酒席口罩脱销了。
Before the train station was shut down: masks were sold out, and the hotel cancelled its annual banquet masks.
1月23日上午10:30左右，记者走访了位于荆州市沙市区的5家药店。
On January 23 around 10: 30 a.m., reporters visited five pharmacies in downtown Jingzhou.
其中3家，记者刚进店门便被告知：“口罩卖完了！”当记者问及多久能够补货时，店员均表示无法确定具体时间，其中一家店员告诉记者：“明天下午或后天早上可能来货，但肯定不会太多。
"When asked how long it would take to replenish their supply, the clerk told reporters:" Tomorrow afternoon or the morning after tomorrow, but definitely not too much. "
”另一家药店则对店内为数不多的简易包装N95型口罩实行限购，每人限购1只；位于江汉北路的百姓缘药店则拿出了仅剩的3箱口罩，其中N95型口罩每只售价19.8元，不算便宜的价格在半小时内被闻讯而来的市民买光。
Another drugstore restricted the purchase of one of the few portable N95 masks in the store, while the popular drugstore on Jianghan North Road pulled out the remaining three boxes, of which the N95 was priced at $19.80 each.
一次性医用口罩50只售价约49元，前来购买口罩的市民大多两盒起买。
Disposable medical masks cost about $49 each. Most people who come to buy them start buying two boxes.
位于江汉北路，易捷便利店旁的百姓缘药店，这是记者在江汉北路走访的5家药店中，还有库存且不限购的唯一一家药店。
Located in Jianghan North Road, Easyconvenience store next to the people's drug store, this is the reporter in Jianghan North Road visited the five pharmacies, but also inventory and unrestricted purchase of the only pharmacy.
此外，江汉北路上销售医疗器械的两家门店则早已关门。
In addition, Jianghan North Road on the sale of medical equipment on the two stores have long closed.
1月23日凌晨，武汉封城的消息一出，这座距离疫情中心超过200公里的城市似乎刚刚反应过来，记者观察到，江汉北路附近的行人戴口罩与不戴口罩的人数各占一半，中老年人戴口罩的较少。
In the early morning hours of January 23, the city of Wuhan, more than 200 kilometers from the epicentre of the outbreak seems to have just reacted, reporters observed the number of pedestrians near Jianghan North Road wearing face masks and the number of elderly wearing masks less.
23日下午两点，记者来到荆州火车站，相比十天前，这里的人流稀疏不少，且约有三分之二的人戴上了口罩。
Reporters arrived at Jingzhou Railway Station at 2 p. m. on the 23rd, sparse crowds and about two-thirds of people wore masks compared to 10 days ago.
不戴口罩的人也不一定是防疫意识不足，一名天天在火车站来回的李姓司机（下文称李师傅）向记者表示：“还没买到口罩。
A driver surnamed Li, who travels to and from a railway station every day, told reporters: "I haven't bought a mask yet.
”由于武汉上午10点封城，这个时间点从荆州下车的乘客大多来自外省，基本人人戴上了口罩，大多行色匆匆，部分人走向市内公交、出租站点，更多的人则朝着出站口左侧荆州客运站方向前行。
Since Wuhan was closed at 10 a.m., most of the passengers who got off from Jingzhou at this time came from the provinces, where most of the passengers wore masks and were mostly in a hurry.
图为荆州火车站出站口下车的乘客们走向客运站方向，从这里要么坐公交大巴，要么和老乡拼车回家。
Passengers disembark at the Jingzhou railway station exit and head for the station, from where they either take a bus or carpool home with their fellow villagers.
记者向拉客拼车的司机询问从火车站到公安县（荆州市辖县）斗湖堤的价格，司机表示：“一口价每人五十。
Asked by carpool drivers how much they would charge for the Doohu levee from the railway station to the county police station, the driver said: "The price per person is 50.
”李师傅看上去生意不大好，没怎么拉到客人，他告诉记者：“从腊月二十七开始，火车站这边工作人员基本戴上了口罩。
"Shifu Li didn't seem to be doing very well in business, so he didn't get many visitors," he told reporters.
”不过记者注意到，火车站环卫工人并非人人都有口罩。
But reporters noticed that not everyone at the railway station was wearing masks.
一位环卫工人告诉记者：“这两天火车站戴口罩的人比较多，我去药店买到了一点，先戴着。
"There are more people wearing masks at railway stations these two days," an sanitation worker told reporters.
然后给我们队队长打电话，他给我们弄来了两盒口罩。
Then he called the captain of our team and he brought us two boxes of masks.
”但另一位环卫工人则没那么幸运，在意识到需要买口罩的时候她已经买不到了。

两位环卫工人向记者表示：“队里每人分到手是一人两只，先戴着再说。

The picture shows a sanitation worker who never bought a mask and a colleague behind her holds two boxes of face masks that were handed out by her unit, two per person.
在火车站出站口左侧与客运站交接处的一家便利店，记者注意到窗外贴着“KN95口罩有售”字样，当记者问及能否购买口罩时，店老板回复：“早卖光了。
At a convenience store on the left side of the depot, which joins the station, the reporter noticed that a KN95 mask was on sale outside the window. When asked if it would be possible to purchase one, the owner replied, "It's sold out.
”记者获悉，这家店的此类口罩售价为50元一只。
The reporter was told that the store was selling for 50 yuan for one such mask.

"The Wenhu has cancelled several tables, and tomorrow the situation at the other restaurant may be similar," the owner of a vegetable stand at the two lakes farmers' market told reporters.

另一位老家在监利县，从浙江嘉兴返乡的一对父子向记者表示：“还是有点小激动的。
"Another home in prison Li County, from Jiaxing, Zhejiang Province, a father and son told reporters:" Still a little excited.
”他们向记者表示，浙江疫情防控已经到了乡村，他们父子离开嘉兴需向当地报备，同时回到嘉兴也必须向当地单位汇报，这对父子提到：“不仅是来回都要汇报，在湖北的身体情况也需按时上报”。
They told reporters that prevention and control of the disease in Zhejiang had reached the countryside, and that their father and son had to report back to Jiaxing when they left Jiaxing.
当记者问及二人家乡——监利县红城乡农村是否有类似应对措施时，他们表示：“暂时还未接到通知，但会主动去辖区登记。
"We haven't been notified yet, but we will go to the district voluntarily to register," they said when asked if there were similar measures in the rural and urban areas of Hongli county, the home town of the two.

The two men said they would synthesise whether there was an outbreak of illness in their home county and whether their bodies were feverish and coughing.
