文｜西答这几天，阳光洒满了湾区。
The sun has been pouring down on the Bay Area these days.
太平洋那边，扬子江畔的武汉这几日依然湿冷，天气预报说今明两天降水概率50%。
Across the Pacific, Wuhan on the Yangtze River is still wet and cold these days, the weather forecast said the probability of rain this two days 50%.
“我们是1月14号从湖北回到湾区的，这也过去三周多了。
"We returned to the Bay Area from Hubei on January 14, more than three weeks ago.
”大J是湾区某高科技公司的软件工程师，俗称高级“码农”。
Big J is a software engineer for a high-tech company in the Bay Area, popularly known as "senior code farmer."
他语气平静，好像很少有情绪起伏，不急不缓地回忆着这一段让他一家终生难忘的经历。
His tone was calm, as if there were few emotional ups and downs, and he recalled the experience that had impressed his family all his life.
像很多“美漂”家庭一样，大J的家人都在国内。
Like many "beautiful floating" families, Big J's family is at home.
双职工家庭每年都攒着一个大假，用来回国或者来一趟长途旅行。
Dual-earner families save for a big vacation a year to return home or take a long trip.
今年他们赶在圣诞假期前回国，在家乡湖北短暂待了几日，就和妻子去云南采采风。
This year, they returned home before the Christmas holidays, spent a few days in their hometown of Hubei, and went to Yunnan with their wife to gather wind.
祖国的山川湖海看也看不完，每次回国只要时间来得及，都要抓紧机会多出去走走看看。
The motherland's mountains, lakes and seas also see not finished, every time the time to return to the time, we should seize the opportunity to go out to see more.
在云南游玩的一周时间里，大J收到朋友的信息，告知武汉出现“不明原因肺炎”，但是“只是告知一下，没什么特别的。
During a week in Yunnan, Big J received a message from a friend informing him of an "unidentified pneumonia" in Wuhan, but "just to let me know, nothing in particular.
”1月4日一家回到荆州，一切都很祥和宁静。
The family returned to Jingzhou on January 4, and everything was peaceful and peaceful.
趁着这大好时光，大J接下来几日又独自穿梭了几座城市，会友、观光。
Take advantage of this great time, the next few days, big J alone shuttle a few cities, friends, sightseeing.
作为“硬核”滑雪发烧友，大J这趟还独自专程去了趟日本滑雪。

对于滑雪的执着，大J属于“看清了滑雪的危险性，还依然热爱着”。
For the ski tenacity, big J belongs to "see the danger of skiing, still love it."
一直到13号再回到武汉，待了一个晚上，14号和妻子、两岁的女儿从武汉踏上了回美国的航班。
After returning to Wuhan on the 13th, he spent the night with his wife and two-year-old daughter on a flight back to the United States from Wuhan.
一切非常顺利，算是过了一个近乎完美的假期。
Everything went very well, and it was a near-perfect holiday.
直到回来的第四天，变化排山倒海而来。
It was not until the fourth day of his return that change set in.
17号周五美国疾病控制和预防中心（CDC）发布新冠病毒警告，20号周一，大J开始感觉到喉咙不舒服，“一般我喉咙不舒服就是要病了，不知道是什么，感觉应该是某种病毒”。
On Friday 17th, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a New Crown Virus alert, and on Monday, 20, Big J began to feel a sore throat.
21号周二，“我们在新闻上看到西雅图那哥们发病了。
On Tuesday the 21st, we saw on the news that Seattle guy was ill.
”大J开始出现感冒发烧症状。
Big J began to develop cold and fever symptoms.
“周二开始我就打我所在城市的urgent care (应急诊)，我说我刚从武汉回来，有感冒症状，而且发烧，可能有冠状病毒感染，你们那里能测吗？”“What is Coronavirus（冠状病毒）？Never heard of it。
I said I had just returned from Wuhan with a cold and a fever, and maybe there is a coronavirus infection. Can you measure it there? What is the coronavirus?
”隔着电话都能感觉到院方的茫然，“他们那时候可能确实还不知道是什么，说测不了，让我去找我的家庭医生。
"I could feel the vacant look on the phone." They probably didn't know what it was.
”家庭医生是看非紧急的小病，一般需要提前一段时间的预约，大J电话打过去，也没约到自己的家庭医生，只能找了一个在旧金山城里的其他家庭医生看诊。
Family doctors, who see minor, non-urgent illnesses, usually need to make an appointment some time in advance, call Big J on the phone and miss out on his family doctor, who has to call another family doctor in San Francisco.
“去之前他们还挺紧张的，跟我说，你到了我给你拿口罩，直接把你带到手术室，不用去前台。
"They were nervous before you went. Tell me, when you get there, I'll get you a mask and take you straight to the operating room without going to the front desk.
” 结果呢，“他就给我听了一下肺。
"As a result," he showed me his lungs.
说你症状不像。
Said you didn't have symptoms.
” 大J追问，“那你给我测一下吧，看看是什么病毒，普通流感病毒还是别的？”医生拒绝了这个请求，说不用查了，不像。
"asked Big J." Would you test me to see what virus, common influenza virus, or something? "The doctor refused, saying no, no.
美国药房，口罩已售罄“看了西雅图那个第一个新冠病例，再加上根据坊间消息的推测，我们一家当时很可能和那个哥们是同一班飞机，因为武汉没有直飞西雅图的。
"After seeing Seattle's first new crown case, and based on anecdotal evidence, our family probably had the same flight as the other guy, because Wuhan didn't fly directly to Seattle," he said.
”不确定的恐惧开始聚集，但是大J仍然苦于找到一个机构，给他一个确定的答案。
Uncertain fears began to gather, but Big J was still struggling to find an organization that would give him a definite answer.
出于对别人负责的态度，大J通知了单位自己的症状，恰巧另外一个同事也出现不舒服，去了另外一所医院检查。
Out of a sense of responsibility to others, big J informed the unit of his symptoms, happened that another colleague also appeared uncomfortable, went to another hospital for examination.
“我之所以最终能被检测上，也是因为同事去的这家医院通报了旧金山的公共健康部。
"I was finally tested because my colleagues at the hospital told the San Francisco Department of Public Health.
”期间大J还多次试图打CDC的电话，“他们电话非常难找，我终于给联系上了，一个接线员给我念了很长的一段关于新冠状病毒的介绍，还跟我们说这个病传染性很强，要小心哦！”哭笑不得间，大J追问是否有地方可以给做检测？“他们的建议就是自我隔离，他们没有地方检测，让我在家呆着。
"He also tried to call the CDC several times in the meantime." They were very hard to find and I was finally contacted by an operator who told me that the coronavirus is very infectious, so be careful.
”最让大J头疼的才刚刚开始。
"The biggest headache for Big J was just beginning.
微信上有人开始从打听到催促，想知道大J到底得的是什么。
Someone on the tweets was starting to get a peek at what Big J was getting.
因为在大J一家回来的第一周，出现感冒症状前，还和朋友以及朋友的孩子约了几次饭，“随着新闻上病例的增多，大家都开始担心。
Because in the first week after the Big J's return, we had dinner engagements with friends and friends' children several times before they developed symptoms.
”另一颗炸弹也被点爆，大J所在公司部门给员工发了一封短邮件，说到有一位同事刚刚从武汉回来，疑似病例，提到了流感症状，但是没有说明这位同事已经自我隔离数日，也没有说已检测是A型流感，也没提新冠病毒检测还在进行中。
Another bomb was also detonated, and Big J. 's corporate division sent employees a short email saying a colleague had just returned from Wuhan with a suspected case of influenza, but did not say that the colleague had isolated himself for days, that he had been tested for influenza A, or that a new crown virus test was in progress.
消息不胫而走，各种公司内部微信群炸开了锅。
News spread, and micro-groups within the various companies blew up the pot.
这封模棱两可的邮件内容被猜测，在人们的传递中，似乎拥有了比病毒还快的变异速度，“不出一个小时，我们就在不同的微信群里，看到了不同的消息截图，还有人开始跟我打听这微信里传的人是不是你家老公，”大J的妻子在旁边补充道。
The ambiguous message was supposed to have a faster rate of variation than the virus in the delivery. "Within an hour, we saw different footage of the message in different micro-groups, and people started asking me if the messenger was your husband," his wife added.
“这太扯了，没人能告诉我去哪里做这个检测。
"That's crap. No one can tell me where to go for the test.
我想知道我得的是什么，我也想尽快告诉朋友们，但是没想到检测程序如此不清晰和复杂。
I wanted to know what I was getting at, and I wanted to tell my friends as soon as possible, but I didn't realize that the testing process was so unclear and complicated.
”这时的大J比任何时候都需要一个答案。
At this point Big J needed an answer more than ever.
焦灼着，继续在家隔离，但是家里还有个两岁多的孩子，大J两口子心中的担心逐渐发酵膨胀，慢慢化成了恐惧和无助。
Caught and kept isolated at home, but with a two-year-old child at home, the worries of the elder J and his wife grew and swelled into fear and helplessness.
“很多时候，我拿着饭上楼吃，吃完下楼，都不知道该在哪洗碗。
"Most of the time I go upstairs with my food and finish eating downstairs without knowing where to wash the dishes.
门把手要不要擦？穿鞋下楼，鞋底要不要擦？手套戴了几天，都不敢去碰家里的东西。
Do you want to wipe the door handle? Wear shoes downstairs, do you want to wipe the soles of your shoes? Gloves have been worn for a few days.
孩子看着我叫爸爸，我也不敢抱她。
The child looked at me and called Dad, and I dared not hold her.
”线下的焦虑在线上继续发酵。
Underline anxiety continues to ferment online.
大J回忆道：“这种危难情况下，人性的很多东西都被放大了。
"A lot of human nature is magnified in these situations of distress," Big J. recalls.
从我的这次经历，我看到有的人特别八卦，每天不停地讨论这个病毒，传播各种有的没的消息。
From my experience, I saw that some people are very gossip, day in and day out to discuss the virus, spread a variety of no news.
很多人忍受不了，只能悄悄退群了。
A lot of people can't stand it, only to quietly retreat.
特别多谣言，特别多截屏，打码的不打码的，真的是几分钟之后我从不同的渠道看到自己的截屏。
A lot of rumors, especially multi-screen, play code-free, is really a few minutes later I see their own screen from different channels.
”一个病毒，打开了人性的潘多拉。
A virus that has opened up Pandora of humanity.
当我们跳出自己的微信群，画风并没有多不同。
When we jump out of our own microcosm, the style is not much different.
数不尽的新闻故事，记录着这场灾难冲击波的威力。
Countless news stories chronicled the power of the shock wave of the disaster.
甚至可以说每一个中国家庭都受到了波及，只是程度上的差别：因为一条转发的请求提高生活待遇的微博，被迫在沪集宿宾馆隔离的湖北女孩毕燕雯被网友“逼”到自杀。
It could even be said that every Chinese family was affected, albeit to a different degree: Bei Yanwen, a Hubei girl who was forced to live in isolation in Shanghai's Ji Ju guesthouse, was "forced" to commit suicide by netizens because of a tweet forwarding request to improve living conditions.
武汉封城，很多慢性病患者的生活和生命也都受到了威胁：必须严格用药的艾滋病人，拿不到药物的抓心挠肺；高危怀孕的准妈妈们，也慢慢失去了特殊药物和妇科医生的专业指导，度日如年；肾透析患者没有床位和资源，形若等死。
In Wuhan, the lives and lives of many chronically ill patients are under threat: AIDS patients who must be treated with strict drugs are denied access to medication; expectant mothers with high-risk pregnancies are slowly losing specialized drugs and gynaecologists, and dialysis patients are dying without beds and resources.
数不尽的心碎故事，诉说着普通百姓的惶惶不可终日。
Countless heartbreak stories tell of ordinary people's panic.
终于，大J接到一个通知，告知旁边某郡的一个医院可以在负压病房采集样本。
Finally, Big J received a notification that a hospital in a nearby county could take samples in the negative pressure ward.
湾区已经有几例疑似在那里做了采集。
There have been several suspected cases of collection in the Bay Area.
大J马不停蹄地赶去。
Big J went on and on.
周四做了采样，大J每天催促实验室通知结果，“无助，非常无助。
Sampling Thursday, Big J urged the lab daily to announce the results, "helpless, very helpless."
”到今天大J还没有回复许多朋友询问的微信，“真的不在那个状态，没心情去回复。
"To this day, big J has not responded to many inquiries from friends," really not in that state, not in the mood to reply.
”终于，在第二个周二大J收到了结果：阴性。
Finally, on the second Tuesday, Big J got the results: negative.
负压病房接受检查一时间仿佛甘露降临，附在半空中的乱飘的尘埃，终于可以附着在这露水带来的湿润上，落回地面。
The negative pressure ward was inspected as if dew had fallen. The dust, which had been scattered in mid-air, could finally attach itself to the moisture of the dew and fall back to the ground.
截至2月初，美国CDC共检测210份疑似样本，确诊12例。
As of early February, the United States CDC had tested 210 suspected samples and confirmed 12 cases.
美国的医疗资源和应急救助体系相对完善，但痛苦无法被替代，无法被量化，我们只能凭想象模糊地共情一下这200多个家庭所经历的暗无天日 。
America's health-care resources and emergency-relief system are relatively well developed, but the pain cannot be replaced or quantified, and we can only imagine a fuzzily shared vision of the darkness that has befallen more than 200 families.
这一遭，大J的妻子经历了多方位的信息过载和情感挑战。
This time around, Big J. 's wife has experienced multiple information overload and emotional challenges.
丈夫被隔离期间，她请假在家带娃，“舆论的压力很大，没有时间和精力担心自己的身体 。
During her husband's isolation, she took time off to take her baby with her. "Public opinion is so stressful that she has no time or energy to worry about her body.
万一大J被确诊，我真的会崩溃。
In case big j.gets diagnosed, I really break down.
”大J的妻子所工作的单位便是之前疯传的新冠病毒“特效药”瑞德斯韦的制药公司Gilead, 当看到自己公司CEO “patients first”（病人第一）的发言，“看到希望，不过这也是作为一个商人，应该做的最正确的事。
Big J. 's wife worked for Gilead, a drug maker for the previously wild New Crown Virus "miracle drug," and when she saw her CEO "patients first," she saw hope, but it was also the right thing to do as a businessman.
”危机和机遇，很多时候好像印在了一张卡片的两面。
Crises and opportunities often seem to be printed on both sides of a card.
Gilead几年前成功研发出治愈丙肝的特效药后，反而经历了股市滑铁卢，原因很简单，病治好了，没有人再需要吃药。
Gilead successfully developed a specific cure for hepatitis C a few years ago, only to experience Waterloo on the stock market for the simple reason that no one needed any more medicine.
与此同时，高价的药物也受到了社会的非议。
At the same time, high-priced drugs are coming under criticism from society.
“相比较雪中送炭，人们其实喜欢锦上添花，”大J妻子继续解释道，“比如，医生给你看病，我们觉得理所应当，因为这是他们的工作，我们不在乎他们是不是在用自己的命做这份工作；药厂开发药物，花费大量资金投入，但是很多人可能觉得，既然你有了这个药，就应该低价给我们用，不然就是不道德。
"People really like the icing on the cake when it comes to giving something in the snow," his wife continued. "We take it for granted, because it's their job, we don't care if they're using their lives to do the job.
” 由于这几年Gilead的股市表现平平，这次危机加速了Remdesivir 临床三期在国内的实验进度，或许这次Gilead能打一次翻身仗。
Given Gilead's mediocre stock-market performance in recent years, the crisis has accelerated the progress of the Remdesivivir III clinical trial in China, perhaps this time with Gilead.
大J的家人在国内，疫情暴发前离开了湖北，当地公安局可能根据手机漫游信号锁定湖北号码，“现在每天我爸妈还会定时收到公安局的电话，让他们上报体温，每天。
"Every day my parents receive regular phone calls from the public security bureau asking them to report their temperature every day.
”大J妻子的家人依然在荆州，她的爸爸和妈妈被分离在城区的两个家，因为“爸爸每天要去单位上班，接触的人复杂，他不想把风险传递给我妈。
His wife's family was still in Jingzhou, and her father and mother were separated in two homes in the city because "Dad went to work every day and got mixed up with people who didn't want to pass the risk on to my mother.
”大J妻子语气里写满了担心和无奈。
"His wife's tone was full of worry and helplessness.
“我的老父亲，现在还没有回家，已经连续熬了几个夜了。
"My old father, who has not yet returned home, has been sitting up for several nights.
”大J妻子发来一个哭泣的表情。
"His wife sent a cry.
父母对远游子女“临行密密缝，唯恐迟迟归”的忧虑，在今天被翻转，城外的孩子们遥望着守城的父亲母亲，牵挂和爱化成泪水，无声地落下。
The parents' anxiety that their children would not return was overturned today, and the children outside the city looked out at their father and mother, worried and loved, and fell silently into tears.
风险最大的可能就是大J妻子的表妹，她是武汉儿童医院的护士，已经开始在一线开始核酸标本采集，她之前还哺乳期 。
The biggest risk is likely to be the cousin of the eldest J wife, a nurse at Wuhan Children's Hospital, who has begun collecting DNA samples on the front line while she was breastfeeding.
武汉封城后，公共交通被切断，表妹就骑共享单车去上班。
Wuhan after the closure of the city, public transport was cut off, cousin riding a shared bike to work.
最近，表妹住进了医院旁边的酒店，为了降低感染家人的风险，“已经不回家了。
"My cousin, who recently stayed at a hotel next to the hospital," has stopped going home to reduce the risk of infection.
”大J妻子发来家人群的截图，家人感慨她们“伟大、勇敢”。
His wife sent a screenshot of the family, who lamented that they were "great and brave."
2月5日，一个可爱的新生儿呱呱落地，30小时后，婴儿被鉴定患有新冠肺炎，疑似母婴传递的第一例。
February 5, a lovely newborn quack landing, 30 hours later, the baby was identified as suffering from pneumonia, suspected mother-to-child transmission of the first case.
这个婴孩降生的医院正是大J妻子表妹工作的儿童医院。
The hospital where the baby was born was the children's hospital where Big J's wife and cousin worked.
在我们的对话接近尾声的时候，大J妻子缓缓地舒了一口气，用四个字总结了这次的经历：悲愤交加。
As our conversation drew to a close, Big J. 's wife let out a slow sigh of relief and summed up the experience in four words: Sad and angry.
前一阶段自我隔离的时候，流言蜚语的中伤让她瞥见了“在湖北外的湖北人受到的伤害。
During the previous period of self-imposed isolation, scandalous slurs gave her a glimpse of "the harm done to Hubei people outside Hubei."
我为他们感到心痛，我感同身受，我们这个小家所经历的和这些人相比较真的算不了什么，他们受到的伤害比我们多一千倍一万倍。
I feel heartache for them, and I sympathize with them. What our little family has gone through is nothing compared to these people, who have suffered a thousand times more harm than we have.
” 第二阶段，出隔离后，痛苦的感觉并没有完全随之化解， “我意识到我需要在维护自己内心秩序和行使正义感的同时，还要保护自己的家人，我以前过度乐观了，我现在意识到我做不到这一点。
In the second phase, after isolation, the painful feelings were not completely dissipated. "I realized that I needed to protect my family as well as my inner order and sense of justice.
”这场灾难颠覆的不仅仅是人们的生活常态，很多人已经不再是以前的自己，很多事情都无法再简单回到过去。
The disaster has not just upended people's lives; many are no longer themselves, and many things can no longer simply return to the past.
