“那时候有文件说，武汉市有新型肺炎，但是当时对这个病毒所知太少，也不清楚这个病毒会不会人传人，所以就只是在值班的时候，比以前增加一点防护。
"It was then documented that Wuhan had a new form of pneumonia, but at the time there was too little knowledge of the virus, and it was not clear whether the virus could be passed from person to person, so there was only a little more protection on duty.
”全文2170字，阅读约需2分钟在早期感染新型冠状病毒的医护人员中，同济医院急诊科医生陆俊，是最严重的一个。
"It takes about 2 minutes to read the full text of 2170 words. Among the medical staff who were infected with the new coronavirus in the early stages, the emergency doctor of Tongji Hospital, Lu Jun, was the most serious.
1月5日，他开始发烧，CT显示右下肺少许感染，1月7日复查的时，变成双肺感染。
On 5 January, he developed a fever, and CT revealed a slight infection of the lower right lung, which became a two-lung infection when reviewed on 7 January.
发热持续了9天，之后，逐渐出现了呼吸困难。
The fever lasted nine days, after which there was gradual dyspnea.
在陆俊患病期间，曾有网传消息称其去世。
During Lu Jun's illness, there was news on the Internet that he had died.
为了辟谣，1月23日，他委托一名医生，拍下他活动的视频，发布到网上。
To dispel the rumor, on January 23, he commissioned a doctor to take a video of his activities and post it online.
“这个谣言对奋战在一线的战友打击太大了。
"This is a rumor that strikes too hard on the front line.
我主动辟谣，主要是为他们打气，希望给他们继续战斗的信心。
I took the initiative to deny the rumors, mainly to cheer them up, hoping to give them confidence to continue fighting.
”目前，陆俊仍在同济医院接受治疗，等待身体恢复。
Mr Luk is still being treated at Tongji Hospital pending his physical recovery.
“这次疫情虽然很严重，但危重症患者并不多，我作为危重症患者中的一例，在医务人员的救助下，成功脱离危险，我亲身的经历告诉大家，不要畏惧，要自信。
"Although the epidemic is serious, the number of critically ill patients is not very high. As an example of a critically ill patient, I have successfully emerged from danger with the help of medical staff.
”陆俊说。
"said Lu.
▲陆俊在做康复训练。
Lu Jun is doing rehabilitation training.
━━━━━疑似接诊期间被感染新京报：你是什么时候感染上新型冠状病毒的？陆俊：我估计是1月2日值班的时候被感染的，那天晚上，我接诊的发热病患比较多，大概30个。
Suspected Infection During Hospitalization The Beijing News: When did you get infected with the new coronavirus? Luk Jun: I guess I got it on duty on January 2, and that night I had more cases of fever, about 30.
那些病人大部分不是以新型肺炎确诊，多数是流感，有些是细菌感染，有些是普通感冒。
Most of those patients were not diagnosed with new pneumonia, most of them with flu, some with bacteria and some with a common cold.
新冠肺炎属于病毒感染，但当时没有专门的检测试剂，确诊病人非常少，认识也不够，所以没太注意。
Coronary pneumonia is a viral infection, but at the time there was no specific detection reagent, diagnosis of very few patients, awareness is not enough, so not much attention.
新京报：什么时候发现发热病人开始增多的？陆俊：就是1月2日左右，那时候三个医生一起接诊。
The Beijing News: When did the number of febrile patients start to increase? Lu Jun: Around January 2, when the three doctors were attending the clinic together.
那天我值夜班，一个人接诊了30多个发热病人。
I was on night shift that day, and I had more than 30 feverish patients treated by myself.
当时，同济医院有发热门诊，但还没有专门针对新型肺炎（患者）开放，急诊科才是主战场，我就是急诊内科的，所以大多数发热患者，都来急诊科就诊。
At that time, Tongji Hospital has a fever clinic, but has not been opened specifically for new pneumonia (patients), emergency department is the main battlefield, I am emergency internal medicine, so most febrile patients come to the emergency department.
新京报：那段时间接诊的防护措施是什么？陆俊：那时候有文件说，武汉市有新型肺炎，但是当时对这个病毒所知太少，也不清楚这个病毒会不会人传人，所以就只是在值班的时候，比以前增加一点防护，把平时上班戴的普通医用口罩做了升级，换成防病毒的N95口罩，对防护服和护目镜等还没有要求。
Lu Jun: Back then, it was documented that Wuhan had a new type of pneumonia, but it wasn't clear whether the virus could be transmitted from person to person. So when on duty, we upgraded the normal medical masks we wear to work and replaced them with anti-virus N95 masks, which are not required for protective clothing and goggles.
那时候也没觉得奇怪，毕竟我们平时工作也都戴着口罩。
It didn't surprise me at the time. After all, we all wear masks at work.
━━━━━确诊为武汉新型肺炎时为1月7日新京报：你开始发热生病，有想过病因吗？陆俊：当时怀疑是流感病毒，所以去化验了血，拍了CT。
2008-12-12 00: 00 2007-9-19 19: 19: 00 2007-09-19 09: 19: 00 2007-09-19 09: 19: 07 The New Beijing News of January 7, when Wuhan New Pneumonia was diagnosed: Have you ever thought about the etiology of the disease
考虑到会不会是病毒感染，我做了CT检查，我记得1月5日的CT显示，右下肺少许感染，1月7日复查的时候加重了一点，变成双肺感染了，后来发热一直不能退烧，持续了9天，然后逐渐出现了呼吸困难，就觉得不太对劲了。
To see if it was a viral infection, I had a CT scan on January 5, which showed a slight infection in the lower right lung. On January 7, the CT scan showed a slight increase, becoming a two-lung infection.
持续发烧那9天，我没有再上班。
I didn't go to work for nine days with a persistent fever.
新京报：某医务救助基金资助的名单中，提到医生陆先生1月7日确诊，这个人是你吗？陆俊：是我，这个基金是同济医院的同事帮我申请的。
The Beijing News: A medical aid fund supported by a list of doctors, Mr. Lu confirmed on January 7, this person is you? Lu Jun: It is me, this fund is Tongji Hospital colleagues to help me apply.
那时候，新冠病毒还叫新型肺炎。
At that time, the new crown virus was called the new pneumonia.
我不确定自己是不是第一个确诊的医生，不过我应该是医生中第一例重症确诊病例。
I'm not sure if I was the first doctor to be diagnosed, but I'm supposed to be the first of the doctors to be seriously ill.
▲陆俊转入同济医院后所在的病房新京报：患病期间什么症状？陆俊：从1月5日开始不舒服，当时发热到38.7摄氏度，后来最高的时候达到39.5摄氏度，浑身乏力，肌肉酸痛，呼吸困难，然后每天输液，最晚输到凌晨4-5点，最多的时候要输十几瓶。
What are the symptoms during the illness? Lu Jun: From January 5 onwards, he had a fever of 38.7 degrees Celsius, and then reached 39.5 degrees Celsius. He was tired, sore muscles and dyspnea, and then infusion every day until 4am to 5am at the latest and a dozen bottles at most.
患病期间很焦虑，毕竟上有老下有小，儿子才3岁。
I was anxious during the illness. After all, my son was 3 years old.
我患病的事情，只有我妻子知道，我父亲快80岁了，母亲也快70了，就没告诉他们。
My wife was the only one who knew that my father was going to be 80, and my mother was going to be 70, so she didn't tell them.
当时想得最多的，就是希望快点好起来。
The most important thing to think about at the time was to get better soon.
新京报：目前恢复如何？会对以后工作有影响吗？陆俊：因为之前病得太重，目前正在缓慢恢复中。
The Beijing News: How is the recovery going? Will it have an impact on future work? Lu Jun: Because he was seriously ill before and is recovering slowly.
主要是肺部损伤严重，达到了呼吸衰竭的标准。
It was mainly lung injury that reached the standard of respiratory failure.
现在话说多了，也还会有一点呼吸困难。
Now that I've talked a lot, I'm going to have a little bit of breathing difficulties.
不过现在感觉比之前好多了，只要等肺功能恢复好了，我就可以回家了，而且专家说身体恢复后，应该不会对我以后在急诊的工作有影响。
But I feel much better now. Once my lungs get well, I can go home, and experts say my recovery should have no effect on my future work in the emergency room.
▲陆俊目前服用的药物。
Lu Jun is currently taking the medicine.
受访者供图━━━━━被传身亡后主动辟谣新京报：能具体说下你的诊治过程吗？陆俊：我在本院（同济医院）治疗的时候，主要是依靠一些抗病毒药物，还有激素、丙球、抗生素，以及呼吸支持治疗等。
2007-9-24 16: 55 Reported Death Prompt Mystification of the New Peking Newspaper Can you specify your treatment processLu Jun: When I was treated at our hospital, I mainly relied on some antiviral drugs, hormones, propellants, antibiotics and respiratory support therapy.
1月17日，我从同济医院转到金银潭医院，1月29日又转回同济医院。
On 17 January, I was transferred from Tongji Hospital to Gold and Silver Pool Hospital, and on 29 January I was transferred back to Tongji Hospital.
在金银潭医院治疗期间，有国家卫健委的专家组，还有同济医院的专家，救治主要是输液、雾化抗病毒药物和呼吸支持治疗。
During the course of treatment at the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital, there were experts from the State Sanitarium and Tongji Hospital to treat mainly infusion, nebulized antiviral drugs and respiratory support therapy.
新京报：网传你“因病去世”的事你知道吗？陆俊：我知道，后来是我主动辟谣的。
The Beijing News: Do you know that you died of illness? Lu Jun: I know, then I took the initiative to deny the rumor.
那时候，我刚能下床活动，可以理解成刚开始康复。
At that time, I was able to get out of bed and understand that I was just beginning to recover.
我拜托当时支援金银潭医院的同事，帮我拍了我下床活动的视频传到网上，因为这个谣言对奋战在一线的战友打击太大了。
I asked my co-workers at the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital to post a video of me getting out of bed, because the rumor was too devastating for my comrades on the ground.
我有个同事说，当时看到我去世的消息，还大哭了一场。
One of my colleagues said that when I saw the news of my death, I cried a lot.
我知道我的同事很忙很累，病人的情绪不好，防护用品也紧缺，如果我没有感染，肯定也跟同事们一起在一线接诊，但现在因病没去成，有点遗憾。
I know my co-workers are very busy and tired, the patients are in a bad mood and protective equipment is in short supply. If I hadn't been infected, I would have been on the front-line with my colleagues, but I'm sorry I didn't make it.
我主动辟谣，主要是为奋战在一线的医疗同行打气，希望给他们继续战斗的信心。
I took the initiative to deny rumors, mainly to fight in the front line of the medical colleagues, hoping to give them the confidence to continue fighting.
▲网传陆俊因病去世后，协和医院的医生，帮其在微博上辟谣。
Internet transmission Lu Jun died of illness, Concorde hospital doctors, to help them in the Weibo rumor.
微博截图新京报：现在在同济医院，自己的同事给你看病，感觉有什么不一样的吗？陆俊：我已经把自己当病人了，自己把角色转换一下，就觉得没什么了。
Weibo screenshot of the Beijing News: Now in Tongji Hospital, my colleagues give you a medical treatment, what's the difference? Lu Jun: I already think of myself as a patient.
新京报：现在吃饭怎么解决呢？陆俊：现在都是我爱人送饭过来，她一般都会把饭放到护士站。
The Beijing News: How to solve the problem of eating now? Lu Jun: Now it's all my wife's food. She usually puts the rice in the nurses' station.
新京报：经历这次事儿后，有什么想传达给大家的吗？陆俊：这次疫情虽然很严重，但危重症患者并不多，我作为危重症患者中的一例，在医务人员的救助下，成功脱离危险，我亲身的经历，告诉大家，不要畏惧，要自信，有国家和人民做后盾，冲在第一线的医务人员一定能战胜这次疫情。
The Beijing News: After the experience, is there anything you want to share with usLu Jun: Although the outbreak is serious, the number of critically ill patients is very few.
