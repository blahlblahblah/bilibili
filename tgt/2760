受访者饶俊媚提供网络截图想回国30多年前，饶俊媚跟随亲戚从老家浙江青田县来到意大利，在离米兰50多公里外的贝加莫经营餐厅，做过中餐、自助餐和日料等，目前在意大利北部经营着3家餐厅。
More than 30 years ago, Rao Junmei followed relatives from his hometown of Qingtian, Zhejiang Province, to Italy, where he runs a restaurant in Bergamo, more than 50 kilometers away from Milan. He has served Chinese food, buffets and daily necessities, and now runs three restaurants in northern Italy.
2019年底，饶俊媚被推选为意大利北部丽水同乡会会长。
At the end of 2019, Rao Junmei was elected president of Yeosu Township Association in northern Italy.
她说，贝加莫有8000余名华侨，以浙江温州籍和丽水籍为主，餐饮业是当地华侨从事的重要产业。
She said Bergamo has more than 8,000 overseas Chinese, mainly from Wenzhou and Yeshui in Zhejiang, where the catering industry is an important industry for overseas Chinese.

"Since late January, Chinese restaurant business in northern Italy has fallen by 20% to 30% as a result of the outbreak of crowning pneumonia, and many visitors to restaurants ask if there are any new Chinese.

”饶俊媚告诉澎湃新闻。
Raojun told the stormy news.
2月23日起，随着意大利疫情的进一步蔓延，在意北部的华人自发关停了餐厅，受停业影响，饶俊媚旗下的餐厅每天亏损约2万多欧元。
Since Feb. 23, Rao Junmei's restaurant has suffered a loss of more than 20,000 euros a day as a result of the shutdown of Chinese restaurants in the north as the epidemic spread further.
随着意大利疫情的加剧，不少意大利华侨萌生了回国避疫的想法。
With the increase of the epidemic in Italy, many Italian overseas Chinese have come to the idea of returning home to avoid the epidemic.
“据我了解，2月中旬在意大利的丽水籍回国人员每天只是个位数，2月底就多了，最近几天就更多了。
"I understand that the number of Yeosu returnees in Italy in mid-February is only a few digits a day, more at the end of February and even more in recent days.
昨天我就接到16个电话，都是聊回国的，其中8个人已明确要回国，还有人不肯告诉我确切消息。
Yesterday I received 16 phone calls, all of them to China. Eight of them have already made it clear that they want to go back to China.
想回国的主要原因是，他们感觉老家浙江的疫情控制得好，而且具备非常好的新冠肺炎治疗经验。
The main reason for wanting to return home is that they feel that their hometown of Zhejiang is well-controlled and has very good experience in treating New Crown Pneumonia.
”饶俊媚说。
"said Rao.
意大利北部青田同乡会国内联络人徐伟雄告诉澎湃新闻，意大利到中国的航班早已停航，很多在意华侨需辗转俄罗斯才能坐飞机回国，最近几个群里还在商讨从包机回国的。
Xu Weixiong, a domestic contact with the Tsinghua Tadao Association in northern Italy, told Pai Pai News that flights from Italy to China had stopped, that many Italian nationals had to fly home through Russia, and that several groups had been discussing returning from charter flights in recent days.
“我了解到，意大利疫情爆发后，已经有100多人辗转回到了青田。
"I understand that more than 100 people have run back to Qingtian after the outbreak of the epidemic in Italy.
”据3月2日丽水市卫健委官方微信公号“健康丽水”发布内容显示，确诊病例王某经莫斯科转机飞抵上海后，包车于2月28日回到户籍地青田。

The 7 cases were in close contact with Wang Mou, who worked in the same restaurant in Bergamo, Italy.
饶俊媚告诉澎湃新闻，王某家经营的这家餐厅，除王某本人等回国被确诊的8人外，另有几名浙江青田籍、文成籍和菲律宾籍的员工，还留在意大利贝加莫。
Raojun told Pai Pai news that Wang runs the restaurant, in addition to Wang himself and other home confirmed eight people, there are several Zhejiang Qingtian, Wencheng and Filipino employees, but also stay in Bergamo, Italy.
口罩危机  饶俊媚向澎湃新闻介绍，在国内新冠肺炎疫情爆发后，她所在的侨团立刻召集会员在意大利北部采购防疫物资，共筹集6万多个口罩，除侨团会员留用5000多个外，其余都捐赠给了家乡丽水市。
In the wake of the outbreak of pneumonia in China, her expatriate community immediately called on its members to purchase epidemic prevention materials in northern Italy, raising more than 60,000 masks, and donated them to her hometown of Yeosu, in addition to retaining more than 5,000 members, the news said.
2月下旬以来，意大利疫情蔓延，口罩、防护服和护目镜等防疫物资成了抢手货。
Since late February, the epidemic in Italy has spread and epidemic prevention materials such as masks, protective clothing and goggles have become popular.
“原来购买一包50个装的口罩10多欧元，最近价格飙升到100欧元了。
"The price of a 50-pack mask, which was more than 10 euros, has surged to 100 euros recently.
更糟糕的是，有意大利商家在责怪中国人之前大量采购口罩，不愿意再把口罩卖给我们，这让口罩更加紧缺。
To make matters worse, some Italian businesses are buying masks before blaming the Chinese and are reluctant to sell them to us, adding to the shortage of masks.
”饶俊媚说。
"said Rao.
“即使疫情越来越严重，意大利街上戴口罩的人仍很少。
"Even as the epidemic gets worse, the number of people wearing masks on the streets of Italy remains low.
意大利人见面会行贴面礼，在他们看来，戴口罩的要么是病人、要么是医生，当地政府也没有强行要求出门戴口罩。
Italians wear masks either as patients or as doctors, and the local government has not forced them to go out and wear masks, according to them.
见到出门戴口罩的人，很多当地人会避而远之。
Many locals shun seeing people wearing masks when they go out.
我戴口罩上街还得用围巾挡住口罩。
I wear a mask and I have to cover it with a scarf.
有一些极端分子会无缘无故殴打戴口罩的华人、华侨，并且说一些难听的话。
Some extremists beat Chinese and overseas Chinese wearing masks for no apparent reason and say nasty things.
”饶俊媚说。
"said Rao.
让饶俊媚感到舒心的是，老家丽水市的政府部门已主动与他们取得了联系。
To the comfort of RaoJunMei, the government departments of Lishui, the hometown, have contacted them on their own initiative.
丽水市委统战部、侨联等部门，通过网络图文和视频给他们讲解疫情知识，指导防疫。
Lishui Provincial Commissariat, Overseas Chinese Federation and other departments, through the network graphics, text and video to explain the epidemic knowledge, guidance epidemic prevention.
丽水市政府部门首批援助意大利华侨的口罩等防疫物资已在运输途中。
Yishui city government first aid Italian overseas Chinese mask and other epidemic prevention materials have been in transit.
饶俊媚发现，最近几天，意大利街头戴口罩的人多起来了，当地的防护意识也慢慢增强了。
In recent days, more people have been wearing masks on the streets of Italy and the awareness of local protection has gradually increased, Rao found.
她说，华侨想回国是觉得在意大利缺少安全感，但显然疫情期间绝大部分华侨仍会留在意大利。
The overseas Chinese want to return home feeling insecure in Italy, but it is clear that the vast majority will remain in Italy during the outbreak, she said.
3月9日原本是饶俊媚当选意大利北部丽水同乡会会长的庆祝酒会，请柬早在一个多月前就发给了所有会员。
The invitation was sent to all members more than a month ago at what was to have been a celebratory reception for Rao Junmei, president of the Yeosu Township Association in northern Italy.
“我逐个电话通知延后了，希望疫情快点过去，这场庆祝酒会不要让我们等待太久。
"I delayed calling one by one, hoping that the epidemic would soon be over and that this celebration would not keep us waiting.
”饶俊媚说。
"said Rao.
