为推动本地务工人员复工，湖北潜江市作为疫情低风险地区，安排专车“点对点”全程护送出省务工人员赴浙江绍兴返岗。

为应对境外输入，首都机场全部国际及地区进港航班即日起均停靠首都机场处置专区。
To cope with overseas imports, all international and regional inbound flights from the Capital Airport call at the Capital Airport Disposal Zone immediately.
二、境外确诊数直逼中国国内，联合国秘书长呼吁全球互助图2境外累计确诊超过7万例，很快将超过中国国内。

He added that although the virus had been declared a "pandemic," it could still be controlled.
图3欧盟新增病例数与昨日基本持平，但依然是全球疫情的“震中”，今天小编给大家准备了想看的内容，请耐心往下看。
Fig. 3 The number of new cases in the EU is about the same as yesterday, but it is still the epicentre of the global epidemic.
三、特朗普病毒检测阴性，将英国、爱尔兰旅客加入禁止入境名单图4美国累计确诊病例接近3000，但小编仍然坚信，美国的实际感染数字远高于此。
Trump has tested negative for the virus, adding British and Irish travellers to the stop list. Figure 4 Cumulatively, the number of confirmed cases in the United States is close to 3,000, but he remains convinced that the actual number of infections in the United States is much higher.
当地时间3月14日，美国总统特朗普已经完成新冠病毒检测，检测结果呈阴性。
US President Trump has tested negative for the new crown virus on March 14, local time.
出于谨慎考虑，白宫将对与总统特朗普和副总统彭斯密切接触的人群进行体温检查。

此外，欧洲申根区国家受美国旅行禁令影响的数量为26个。
In addition, 26 countries in the European Schengen area are affected by the United States travel ban.

四、指数拟合线（大家想看的在这里）有网友希望再用指数拟合线做些走势分析。
[/ b] [/ b] [/ b] [/ color] [/ color] [/ color] [/ color] [/ color] [/ color]
小编按照实际传染数为3.8，平均传染期5天左右做指数拟合。
According to the actual infection rate of 3.8, the average infection period of about 5 days to do index fitting.
下面分别讨论几个主要国家、地区的情况：湖北，疫情爆发中心 （图5.1）1月29日（相当于n33）以前较好拟合，此后实际线（红色）逐步向右离开，说明防控措施逐步见效。
The situation in several major countries and regions is as follows: Hubei, the epicentre of the outbreak (Figure 5.1) was relatively well fitted before Jan. 29 (n 33), after which the actual line (red) gradually left to the right, indicating that the control measures were gradually taking effect.
中国国内非湖北地区，无准备输入为主（图5.2）1月31日（相当于n33）以前大体拟合，此后以非常果断的方式向右背离，说明防控措施明确有效。
In non-Hubei areas of China, unprepared input predominates (Fig. 5.2) until January 31 (equivalent to n 33) and has since deviated very decisively to the right, indicating that the control measures are clear and effective.
拟合的不尽平滑，或可归因为早期以大规模（由中心区）输入为主，而非以内生传播为主。
Fitting is not smooth, or can be attributed to the early large-scale (from the central area) input, rather than endogenous transmission.
韩国，有准备输入+内生（图5.3）3月1日（n32）前拟合较好，此后实际线向右明确分离。
Korea, with ready input + endogenous (Figure 5.3) March 1 (n 32) before fitting better, after which the actual line to the right clear separation.
韩国在没有封城措施的情况下还能较快（n32比之于n33）达到有效控制，应主要归因于其疫情起步期比中国晚大约30天，从而有较早预警、预防，较早实现大规模检测和追踪、隔离措施的可能。
South Korea's ability to achieve effective control relatively quickly (n-32 compared to n-33) without closures is largely attributable to the fact that the outbreak started about 30 days later than in China, thus allowing for early warning, prevention, early realization of large-scale detection and tracking, and isolation measures.
意大利，有准备输入+内生（图5.4）意大利前期输入为主，人口和湖北接近，疫情曲线竟也异乎寻常地与疫情中心区相近。
Italy, prepared to input + endogenous (Figure 5.4) Italy's pre-input, population and Hubei close, the epidemic curve is also unusually close to the epicenter of the epidemic.
3月8日（n34）以前拟合较好，此后逐步向右，同当时的湖北一样表现犹犹豫豫。
March 8 (n 34) before fitting better, and then gradually to the right, as the Hubei as hesitant.
显示似乎疫情有所控制，但又很不彻底。
It appears that the outbreak is under control, but is far from complete.
考虑到意大利目前在检测、救治、追踪、隔离等环节所采取的实际行动，以及超高的病死率（6.8%），此情况暂且存疑。
In view of Italy's current detection, treatment, tracking, isolation and other practical actions, as well as the extremely high mortality rate (6.8%), this situation is in doubt.
接下来我们还会进一步深入比较。
We'll go further next.
西欧其他几个主要国家，输入+内生（图5.5）西欧其他几个主要国家，输入+内生。
Several other major countries in Western Europe, input + endogenous (figure 5.5). Several other major countries in Western Europe, input + endogenous.
数据很不乐观。
The data are far from encouraging.
3月5日（n29）以后实际曲线一直坚定地站在拟合线左边，n38时，实际病例数已经比拟合理论值多了35%。
After March 5 (n 29), the actual curve remained firmly on the left of the fitting line, and n 38, the actual number of cases was 35% higher than the theoretical value.
这意味着它们（合计）目前的实际传染数（R值）大于3.8。
This means that their current (combined) actual infections (R values) are greater than 3.8.
美国，有准备的输入+内生（图5.6）尽管美国领导更喜欢说疫情是外来的，但实际上美国疫情已经转为内生为主了。
In the United States, prepared inputs + endogenous (Figure 5.6) Although US leaders prefer to say that the epidemic is exogenous, the epidemic in the United States has actually turned endogenous.
美国外防输入做了一些事（限制旅行），内防传播则远远不足。
The U. S. foreign-defense input does something (restrict travel), but internal defense is far from adequate.
实际曲线几乎被完美拟合，但这未必是好消息。
The actual curve is almost perfectly fitted, but that is not necessarily good news.
因为这表明他们对疫情至今缺少实质性干预。
This suggests that they have so far lacked substantial intervention in the epidemic.
在所有事项中，检测、收治、追踪、隔离这个工作闭环缺一不可。
In all matters, detection, treatment, follow-up, isolation this work must be closed loop.
而美国至今连检测都远未到位。
And the United States is far from even testing in place.
确实令人担忧。
Indeed, it is worrying.

Europe, the epicentre of the epidemic, is in dire straits: Table 1 shows that, as can be seen from the table above, the rate of infection in Europe, particularly in Italy, Spain and Switzerland, is much higher than in other countries and regions.

In particular, Italy has a fatality rate of 6.81 per cent, which is well above the global average of 3.4 per cent estimated by the World Health Organization.
