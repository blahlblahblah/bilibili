作者 | 苏琦编辑 | 魏佳新冠疫情爆发以来，和“吃”有关的行业可谓冰火两重天。
Ever since the outbreak of Wei Jia's new crown, the industry involved in eating has been at its zenith.
一方面，生鲜电商迎来爆发，京东生鲜配送到家业务相对节前环比增长370%，叮咚买菜大年三十的订单量比上月增长超过300%；美团买菜在北京地区的日订单量达到了春节节前单量的2-3倍；除夕至初四，每日优鲜平台实收交易额较去年同期增长321%。
On the one hand, fresh electricity merchants ushered in an explosion of fresh electricity business, with sales growth of 370% over the previous month. Orders for Ding Dong's vegetables grew by more than 300% over the previous month.
另一方面，同样需要配送，同样关乎吃，外卖行业却数据惨淡。
On the other hand, the need for distribution, also related to food, the takeaway industry data is bleak.
即使外卖成为不少餐饮商家自救的选择，外卖平台却因季节因素和疫情的双重打击，数据下滑明显。
Even if take-out become a lot of restaurant business self-help choice, take-out platform due to seasonal factors and the outbreak of double hit, data decline significantly.
据极光大数据统计，以除夕为分割点，春节假期美团平台的日活用户数较除夕前下降41.3%，饿了么的日活下滑则更为严峻，下降44.8%。
According to the Aurora big data statistics, to New Year's Eve as a segmentation point, the number of Chinese New Year's Eve tour platform of the United States fell 41.3% compared with the previous New Year's Eve, the daily decline is more severe, 44.8%.
两个平台除夕后的恢复曲线均低于去年同期，美团尤为明显，人均使用频次也较去年下降了0.2次。
The recovery curves of both platforms after New Year's Eve were lower than the same period of last year.
从渗透率上看，由于假期影响，每年1月份团购外卖均处于年度低谷，而2020年春节期间的总使用时长相比2019年下降更为显著。
In terms of penetration, group take-out is at an annual trough in January due to holiday effects, while total usage during the Spring Festival in 2020 has declined more than in 2019.
外卖平台订单下滑，背后反映的其实是商家无生意可做，复工困难和消费者点餐的谨慎加剧了这一现象。
The decline in take-out orders reflects the fact that businesses have no business to do, exacerbated by the difficulty of returning to work and cautious ordering by consumers.
虽然饿了么和美团分别针对商家推出了“扶持政策”，但商家对此并不买账，称能真正用得上的政策很少。
Although hungry and the U. S. Mission launched a separate "support policy", but businesses did not buy it, saying that there are few policies really available.
部分商家选择和企业合作配送团餐、开发产品上线电商或发力小程序，展开艰难的自救。
Some businesses choose and enterprises to cooperate in the distribution of group meals, development of products on-line business or power small procedures, launched a difficult self-help.
外卖订单量仅恢复至年前三分之一外卖平台的DAU数据接近腰斩，最先感知到的就是商家。
With take-out orders back to just under half of the DAU data on the top one-third of take-out platforms, businesses are the first to be felt.
薇薇在杭州余杭区经营着一家西式快餐店“帕尼尼利亚”，位于钉钉楼下，主要售卖三明治、沙拉和咖啡。
Wei runs a western-style fast-food restaurant Paninilla in Hangzhou's Yuhang District, nailed downstairs, selling sandwiches, salads and coffee.
这是一家2019年10月才开张的新店，新店的堂食生意都一般，但在外卖平台上做得风生水起，做了三个月左右，每日单量已有250多单，按照25元的平均客单价，一天下来，营业额能有6000多元。
The new store, which opened only in October 2019, has a modest business but has been doing well on takeout platforms for three months or so. It has more than 250 orders a day and can generate more than 6,000 dollars in turnover by the end of the day based on an average guest price of 25 yuan.
“12月开始，我的店发展势头不错。
"My store has been doing well since December.
我是连锁加盟店，杭州共有8家店，我这家店12月销量都超过其他几家店。
I am a chain of franchises, Hangzhou has eight stores, I this store in December sales are more than a few other stores.
”薇薇告诉燃财经，她本想趁热打铁，过年之后把外卖的流量再往上冲一把，没想到碰到了疫情。
Wei told Flaming Finance that she had hoped to hit the hot iron, after the New Year to take away the flow up again, did not expect to encounter an epidemic.
她介绍，节后上线外卖三周以来，第一周订单量极低，每天只有二三十单，现在虽说提升到七八十单，订单量依旧只有年前的三分之一。
After three weeks of on-line take-out, orders have been extremely low for the first week, standing at only 20 or 30 a day, and though they have now risen to 70 or 80, orders are still only a third of what they were three weeks ago.
过年期间帕尼尼利亚全程关店，本来暂定初七复工，但因为复工申请一直拖延，从年前除夕前一天歇业开始算，一共歇了28天，营业额为0。
During the New Year Panilla shop, the original tentative resumption of seven days, but because of the resumption of work applications have been delayed, starting from the day before the New Year's Eve, a total of 28 days rest, turnover 0.
而外卖本来就占到整个店收入的60%-70%，现在堂食业务直接被砍掉，每天的营业额只能维持基本的店铺租金和员工工资。
And take-out, which already accounts for 60% to 70% of the store's revenue, is now being chopped off, generating a daily turnover that pays only basic store rents and staff salaries.
“偶尔订单量稍微低一点，每天还要纯亏一两百元。
"Occasionally I place a small order with a net loss of one or two hundred dollars a day.
”薇薇称。
"said Wei.
对帕尼尼利亚来说，原本早中餐是高峰时间段，现在中餐时间段的单量掉得非常厉害，早餐的订单量跟以往相比也只有50%的留存。
For Paninilla, which used to be the rush hour, orders for breakfast have fallen off sharply, with only 50% of orders for breakfast retained.
订单量下滑，薇薇只能缩短营业时间：早上8:00开门，下午4:30就打烊。
Orders fell and Vivian had to shorten her business hours: 8 a.m. for hours and 4.30 p.m. for hours.
包括帕尼尼利亚在内，园区内周围的店铺，基本7点以后都接不到订单了。
The shops around the campus, including Paninilla, won't be able to pick up orders after seven o'clock.
同样的遭遇发生在广东轻食店“鲨啦派”的身上。
The same thing happened to the shark-pie at the Guangdong light-food store.
店主蔡先生告诉燃财经，鲨啦派有7家门店，目前只有3家店铺复工，堂食业务原本占整体营业额的60%，目前受疫情影响无法开工，只能做外卖。
Shopkeeper Cai told Flaming Finance that only three of the seven shark shops were back on the job, and the canteen business, which had accounted for 60 per cent of the total turnover, was unable to start work on takeout due to the outbreak.
鲨啦派于2月20开始恢复上线外卖平台，美团的订单量现在是40单左右，饿了么的订单量是20单左右，疫情前订单是现在的3-4倍。
Shark La Pie resumed its online take-out on Feb. 20, and orders for the U. S. Mission are now about 40. Are you hungry for about 20 orders and pre-epidemic orders are 3-4 times higher than today's.
单店营业额以往每天有五六千元，现在每天连1000元都不到。
Single-store turnover used to be five or six thousand dollars a day, but now it's less than 1000 yuan a day.
二三线城市的商家在外卖上恢复速度吃力，身处北京的商家也面临同样问题。
Businesses in second- and third-tier cities are struggling to recover from takeout, as are businesses in Beijing.
小恒水饺创始人兼CEO李恒称，他关掉了小恒水饺近100家门店的堂食，只保留了外卖。
Li Heng, founder and CEO of Fonterra Dumplings, said he had switched off nearly 100 of the dumplings and kept only takeaway.
在疫情到来之前，小恒水饺已在北京市场占了美团和饿了么65%-70%的饺子市场份额。
Before the outbreak, xiaoheng dumplings in the Beijing market has accounted for the U. S. Mission and hungry 65% to 70% of the dumpling market.
但即便对于这样一家线上业务已非常成熟的快餐企业，春节疫情期间的外卖订单量只有平时的20%，堂食减到30%左右。
But even for a fast-food company with a well-established online business, orders for take-out during the Spring Festival holiday have fallen to about 30% from the usual 20%.
正常情况下，小恒水饺一个100平米的店面，每天营业额一万五到两万，春节期间会降到6000到7000元，现在春节期间单店每天的营业额只有2000到3000元，但是每个店每天的最低的运营成本也要2000到3000元，所以大部分店现在都是亏损的，这还不算总部的成本。
Under normal circumstances, a 100 square meter store turnover, daily turnover of 15,000 to 20,000 yuan, Spring Festival will fall to 6,000 to 7,000 yuan, the Spring Festival period, the turnover of a single store is only 2000 to 3000 yuan, but the minimum daily operating cost of each store is 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, so most stores are now losing money, not counting the cost of the head office.
难以享受到的扶持政策平台和商家可谓“唇亡齿寒”，商家的日子不好过，平台也没有春天。
The hard-to-reach enabling policy platforms and businesses are "desperate," with businesses struggling and platforms without spring.
疫情之下，外卖平台自身损失惨重，无论是外卖业务单量下滑、骑手人力紧缺，还是防护装备的采购和无接触配送的实行，都进一步增加了成本，导致每单成本急剧上升。
Under the epidemic, the delivery platforms themselves suffered significant losses, whether in terms of a decline in take-out business orders, a shortage of riders, or the introduction of the procurement of protective equipment and non-contact distribution, all of which have further increased costs, leading to a sharp rise in costs per unit.
因此，平台如何帮助商家维护店铺经营，增加用户购买信心和兴趣，尽快恢复外卖订单数量，成为了关键。
Therefore, how the platform can help businesses to maintain shop operations, increase customer confidence and interest in buying, as soon as possible to resume the number of take-out orders has become the key.
饿了么和美团分别针对商家推出了相关“扶持政策”，与商家一起共克时艰，实际上这也是两大平台紧密绑定商家的一场竞赛。
Hungry and the United States Mission respectively launched a related "support policy" with businesses to overcome difficult times, in fact, the two platforms are closely bound to business.
针对商家，美团方面启动“春风行动”。
For businesses, the U. S. Mission to launch "Operation Spring Wind."
在复工方面，美团在全国推行“无接触”“安心码”，食材供应链“保价不断货”，最快七小时送达；在现金流方面，美团到店服务湖北地区免佣再延一个月，全国新合作商户延长年费有效期两个月。
In terms of resumption of work, the US Mission launched a nationwide "no contact" "reassurance code," food supply chain "continuously guaranteed prices," the delivery of materials at the earliest seven hours; in terms of cash flow, the United States Mission to the store service Hubei area no commission for another month, the new cooperative extended the annual fee valid for two months.
此外，美团携手邮储银行、光大银行等追加100亿元优惠利率贷款，并赠送商家每月5亿元流量红包、4亿元商户补贴，帮助商户获客。
In addition, the delegation joined hands with the Postal Savings Bank and Everbright Bank to provide an additional 10 billion yuan in preferential interest rate loans.
口碑饿了么则升级“开工十件套”，宣布从3月1日开始，对部分餐品优质、服务优秀的商户再一次进行佣金减免：其中饿了么平台的商品佣金降低5%-7%，口碑平台佣金部分减免，最高全免，为期1到3个月。
Starting from March 1, the commission will be reduced once again for some high-quality and excellent service merchants: Are you hungry for a 5% -7% reduction in commission for your products and a partial exemption for your word-of-mouth platform commission for a period of one to three months?
但对于这些政策，部分商家并不买账。
But some businesses don't buy into these policies.
“就拿美团的贷款扶持政策来说，虽然它说是扶持，但是贷款此前就有，疫情期间的利息也没有变，优惠利率是针对优质商户的。
"In the case of the Mission's lending support policy, it says it is supportive, but the loans were there before, the interest rates didn't change during the epidemic, and the preferential rates were for high-quality merchants.
真正能申请到贷款的，也都是云海肴云南菜、乐凯撒比萨、北京大鸭梨这样的大商户，对9成以上的中小商家来说只是望梅止渴。
All the big merchants such as Yun Hai, Le Caesar Pisa and Beijing Daya Pear can really apply for loans. For over 90% of the small and medium-sized businesses, it is just looking for plums to quench their thirst.
”蔡先生称。
'said Mr. Cai.
而在流量上，蔡先生一个月在美团上要投几万元广告费。
And in the flow, Mr. Cai in the U. S. Mission to invest tens of thousands of dollars in advertising expenses.
据他称，投了广告不一定有更多生意，但不打广告是百分百没生意，也就是说广告费已经几乎成了一项固定支出。
According to him, advertising doesn't necessarily lead to more business, but not advertising is 100% dead, which means advertising has become almost a fixed expense.
现在外卖的收入断崖式下降，还要继续支出广告费，这让他十分苦恼。
Now the drop in take-out revenue cliff-style, but also to continue to spend advertising expenses, which makes him very distressed.
薇薇则决定把两家平台的流量推广停掉。
Wei Wei decided to put the two platforms flow promotion stopped.
因为是新店，前三个月她投入得很猛，“两个平台一个月投入大概在1万多元，也不是小数字，所以先停了。
Because it was a new store, she invested heavily in the first three months. "The platforms are about 10,000 yuan a month, not a small number, so stop."
”至于佣金又是另一大难题。
"Commissions are another big problem.
蔡先生介绍，鲨啦派原本在美团上的佣金比例是21％，饿了么是18％，去年年底佣金开始上涨，美团涨了5个点，饿了么涨了3个点。
Mr. Chua said Shark La Pie, who had a 21% commission rate on the U.S. tour, was 18% hungry. The commission started to rise at the end of last year.
图 / 视觉中国帕尼尼利亚同时上线了美团和饿了么，两边佣金都是19%，同时两个平台也都规定了保底的佣金——4.5元一单，比如一个19元的订单，19元乘以19%是3.61元，但这单照收4.5元，超过4.5元以上的都是按照总金额的19%结算。
Picture / Visual China Paninilla on both sides of the line and hungry, both sides of the commission is 19%, while both platforms also have a 19 yuan commission, say 19 yuan multiplied by 19% is 3.61 yuan, but this only charge 4.5 yuan, more than 4.5 yuan is the total amount of 19% settlement.
薇薇称，在疫情期间，饿了么没有给到任何有用的扶持，美团会有一些满减和配送费的补贴，比如商家自己的满减是买25减3，平台补贴1元，用户看到的就是25减4，下单欲望就会强一点。
During the outbreak, Ms. Wei says, 'Hungry doesn't give any useful support,' and the group gets some subsidies for cuts and handouts, such as 25 minus 3 for their own cuts, 1 for platforms, and 25 minus 4 for users.
“两个平台唯一共同的表现是，帮我锁住了月销售数据。
"The only thing the two platforms have in common is to help me lock up my monthly sales data.
如果说节后的订单超过年前一个月中任意一天的订单量，就算节后的订单，如果没有超过，数据还是沿用节前的数据。
If a post-holiday order exceeds an order for any day of the month preceding it, even if the post-holiday order is not exceeded, the data still use pre-session data.
”薇薇称，其实从这一点上就感觉出来，平台的大盘数据也很差，所有商家肯定都是掉分的，因为月销售影响评分和排名。
In fact, she said, 'I felt that from this point, the market data on the platform is also very poor, and all businesses are definitely off-score because of the monthly sales impact scores and rankings.
但在蔡先生的眼里，销量不达标，即使排名不变，表面数据再好看，没生意就是没生意。
But in Mr. Cai's eyes, sales do not meet the standard, even if the ranking unchanged, the surface data no matter how good, no business is no business.
部分商家逃离平台艰难自救外卖平台订单下滑，背后的另一个原因是商家数量也在减少。
Some businesses have fled the platform to help themselves to the decline in delivery platform orders, another reason behind the decline in the number of businesses.
对商家来说，现阶段要面临现金流告急、食材成本上升、房租水电固定支出、防疫物资支出、员工流失等诸多难题。
For businesses, the current stage has to face cash flow crisis, rising material costs, fixed expenditure on rent, epidemic prevention materials expenditure, staff loss and other difficult issues.
其中最紧要的是房租。
The most important of these is the rent.
薇薇正好要在二月中旬交下半年的店面房租，原本和房东协商分两期付款，三个月一付，后来房东松口，让她递交了申请书，申请减免1月房租。
Vivian was due to pay her second-half rent in mid-February. She had agreed with the landlord to pay the rent in two installments, three months at a time.
“我们店目前是微亏状态，如果一直维持这种状态，我得预支半年的10多万房租，前期的四五十万投入，回本的时间也会无限期拉长。
"Our store is now in a slight deficit position, and if I keep it that way, I'll have to pay more than half a million a year in rent, four and a half million dollars in the previous period and an indefinite extension of my return time.
”薇薇称，自己的店还算是有老客户支持，能扛一扛，她所在园区的三分之一的店目前是关门的，甚至有大部分挂上了转让的牌子，但现阶段也不太好转。
Ms. Wei says her store is still supported by regular customers and can carry it. One-third of her campus is now closed, and even most of it carries a transfer label, but it's not getting better at the moment.
薇薇隔壁的一家店直接清场搬走，押金也不要了。
A store next door to Vivian moved out of the store, without a deposit.
薇薇介绍，那家店也是去年刚签的合同，一共签了三年，还有两年交完房租才算不违约。
Wei Wei said, the store was just signed the contract last year, a total of three years, there are two years to pay the rent before non-default.
疫情之下，后面的情况无法预知，要是没有人接盘，撑不完两年一样是违约，目前还要赶紧垫付半年的房租，所以干脆选择止步于此。
Outbreak, the latter situation is unpredictable, if no one plate, can not last two years is the same default, and now hasten to pay half a year's rent, so simply choose to stop here.
蔡先生前几天去广东天河区的街上走了一圈，“街头挺萧条的，很多店都贴着转让或者转租的字样。
Mr. Cai went to the streets of Tianhe District, Guangdong a few days ago. "The streets are very depressed, many shops are affixed with the words of transfer or sublet.
”买防疫物资是商家们遇到的另一大复工难题。
Buying epidemic prevention supplies is another big back-to-work problem businesses face.
薇薇闭关在家里的20多天，每天都在想帮办法买物资，最后靠朋友家人在泰国带货，才在开业一周以后收到了口罩等物资。
Vera spent more than 20 days inside the house, trying to help buy supplies every day, and finally rely on friends and family in Thailand, before opening a week after the opening of a week received supplies such as masks.
“店里四五个员工，每天上班都要消耗口罩、手套还有酒精，前后花了近5000元，好在买到了。
"Four or five employees wear masks, gloves and alcohol every day at work. It costs nearly 5,000 yuan before and after the event, but they get it
”“关关难过关关过”是所有商家必须要面对的课题，外卖单量下滑、平台补贴收效甚微已经成了事实，这种情况下，一些商家开始逃离外卖平台，想办法自救。
With the decline in take-out orders and platform subsidies already a reality, some businesses are fleeing from takeaway platforms to find ways to save themselves.
为此帕尼尼利亚的总店开始利用自己先前积累的企业资源，和企业聊团餐项目。
To this end Paninilla's head office began to use their previous accumulated business resources, and enterprises chat meals projects.
三明治和咖啡本来就比较贴合办公室白领的用餐需求和习惯，加上周边的同类品牌竞争相对较少，为店面打开了一些销量。
Sandwiches and coffee fit nicely with the needs and habits of office white-collar workers, and there is relatively little competition for the same brands around them, opening up some sales for the store.
小恒水饺提前了自己2020的计划，积极恢复工厂复工，找京东、天猫、每日优鲜等渠道合作，上线饺子速冻品。
Xiao Heng dumplings ahead of their own 2020 plan, actively resume the factory to resume work, find Jingdong, Tiantong, daily excellent channels and other channels, on-line dumpling fast-frozen products.
在北京胡同里拥有多家品牌的餐饮企业老板耀扬也在疫情期间进行了一些新尝试，之前外卖在他的整体流水里只占1%左右的份额，但疫情影响了堂食，团队为了提升销售，就在微信群用直播的方式把做菜的过程直播给群友，并将餐食在微店上线，通过闪送或者顺丰同城配送送到食客手中。
Yaoyang, the owner of a multi-brand restaurant in Beijing's Hutongs, also made some new attempts during the epidemic, which previously accounted for only about 1% of his overall water supply. But to boost sales, the team broadcast the cooking live in groups and delivered meals live to customers via flash or Shunfeng.
另外在北京有4家线下门店的大小咖啡，选择在自己的小程序端发力。
Also in Beijing there are 4 off-line store sizes of coffee, choose in their own small program end force.
其实大小咖啡2016年开第一家店的时候，就上线了外卖平台，但并没有实际运营过，一直都是放养状态。
In fact, the size of coffee in 2016 when the first store, on-line take-out platform, but did not actually operate, has always been free state.
选择将精力放在自己的小程序上，是因为小程序不仅可以外卖还可以自提，还能进行全国范围内的零售业务。
Choose to focus on their own small procedures, because small procedures can not only take out but also self-mention, but also a national retail business.
对于一家强调社区生命力的咖啡店来说，线下空间比线上流量重要得多。
For a coffee shop that emphasizes the vitality of the community, offline space is much more important than online traffic.
疫情期间，大小咖啡单店的出杯量只有疫情之前的30%，营业额只有平时的20%-30%，损失不小，才倒逼着发力线上。
During the epidemic, single-store coffee sales of the size of the epidemic is only 30% of the pre-epidemic, turnover is only 20% to 30%, the loss is not small, the power line.
大小咖啡联合创始人张一芃告诉燃财经，“对于一个没有运营过第三方外卖平台的品牌来说，短时间之内去运营不会有结果，每一种运营背后都需要一套完整的逻辑，你得懂它的逻辑，才能够知道怎么去运营。
"To be effective for a brand that does not operate a third-party take-out platform, one needs to understand the logic behind each operation in order to know how to operate it," Zhang Yiyi, a co-founder of both large and small coffee, told Flammable Finance
在一开始的时候，品牌就要想清楚未来自己的增长曲线是在哪里，这次疫情下，匆忙上线外卖平台的商家，其实也不会产生非常大的交易量。
At the outset, brands need to figure out where their future growth curve is, and the rush to take out vendors in this epidemic will not actually generate very large volumes.
”关于疫情前后订单量变化、复工后订单量走势等问题，截至发稿前，口碑饿了么回复燃财经称，本地生活行业的商户营业已经回暖。
Rekindle your reputation before you send it back to business. Businesses in the local life industry are warming up, according to finance and economics.
截至3月初，60%中小商户已复工，其外卖订单量和复工第一周（2月10日-2月17日）相比增长100%。
By early March, 60 per cent of small and medium-sized businesses had resumed work, with orders for take-out increasing by 100 per cent compared with the first week of work (10 February-17 February).
美团方面尚未回复。
The American Mission has yet to respond.
值得注意的是，七麦数据显示，自2月10日大规模返工后，各家外卖平台的下载量已经开始有所回升。
It is worth noting that the number of downloads of all delivery platforms has begun to pick up since a massive rework on February 10.
2020年，餐饮行业线上和线下的业态与竞合，或许将发生变化。
In 2020, the catering industry online and offline industry and competition, may change.
根据极光大数据预测，外卖用户没有大批流失，只是需求被暂时抑制，等疫情过后，预计整个外卖行业会有极速反弹。
According to Aurora big data, take-out users do not have a large loss, but demand was temporarily suppressed, after the epidemic, the entire takeaway industry is expected to rebound at a rapid pace.
困境之中，外卖平台和餐饮商户只有互相助力，才能让用户在疫情之后继续好好吃饭。
Trouble, the takeout platform and restaurant business only mutual help, so that users can continue to eat well after the epidemic.
