2月17日的武汉，封城限行的第26天。
February 17, Wuhan, the 26-day closure of the city.
胡建斌觉得有些恍惚。
Hu felt a trance.
车窗外，夜幕下，路灯闪闪发亮，成串的红灯笼挂满道路两旁，路面没有了往日的车水马龙，许久都看不到一位行人。
Outside the car window, the street lights glittered under the darkness, and chains of red lanterns hung on either side of the road, leaving the old traffic unseen for a long time.
一辆警务车从对面匆匆驶过，路的尽头，高楼外壁上火红的灯光映衬出四个黄色大字：“武汉加油”。
A police vehicle sped past, and at the end of the road, the fiery lights on the outside of the building showed four large yellow letters: "Wuhan refueling."
凌晨6点半出车，到现在刚好12个小时，厚厚的防护服下，衣服早已湿透。
I left at 6: 30 in the morning, and now it's just 12 hours, soaked through with thick protective clothing.
连续15个订单让胡建斌来不及吃上一口饭。
15 consecutive orders so that Hu Jianbin had no time to eat a mouthful of rice.
是的，从早到晚，他没吃一口饭，只是稍微喝了点水。
Yes, from morning till night, he did not take a mouthful of food, only a little water.
“现在是战时，战时，你不可能像平常一样，好好地吃个一日三餐！我就是那种一天不吃也能干事的人。
"You can't eat three good meals a day, as usual, in time of war and war! I'm the kind of person who can't eat and work all day.
”胡建斌是滴滴医疗保障车队的一名志愿者，他所在的车队专门负责接送定点救治医院的医护人员。
Hu Jianbin, a volunteer in a drip-drip medical-care convoy, was in charge of transporting medical staff to designated treatment hospitals.
胡建斌第一时间响应滴滴征召令，加入医疗保障车队。
Hu Jianbin first responded to the drip call-up order to join the medical care team.
1月23日，武汉市内的公共交通停摆，各类平台的叫车业务下线，这个城市被强制按下了暂停键。
On January 23, Wuhan City's public transportation stopped, all kinds of platforms called off the line of business, the city was forced to press the pause button.
封城后的一两天，有民间志愿者自发组建过车队接送市民，很快因为安全问题被叫停。
A day or two after the closure of the city, civilian volunteers spontaneously formed a convoy to pick up the citizens, soon because of security problems was stopped.
情况异常严峻。
The situation is dire.
医护人员上下班无车可乘，有的人需要骑2个小时的自行车才能赶到单位，有的人甚至只能步行上下班。
Some people have to ride bicycles for two hours to get to work. Others even have to walk to and from work.
为了解决“禁车”之难，23日封城当天，滴滴平台开始招募武汉当地的司机志愿者，分别负责社区和医院的“摆渡”工作。
To solve the problem, drip-drip platforms began recruiting local Wuhan drivers to do the ferry work for the community and the hospital.
毫不犹豫地，胡建斌第一时间填表加入，并担任一支分队的队长。
Without hesitation, Hu Jianbin first filled in the form and served as a team leader.
他们的服务范围包括武汉市15家医院的25个院区，目前已经接送了近万名医护人员。
Their services, which cover 25 districts in 15 hospitals in Wuhan, have already taken in nearly 10,000 medical personnel.
可是200人的医护保障车队仍然显得运力匮乏，志愿者们不得不不分白天黑夜地玩命开车，生物钟完全被打乱，以至于将清晨5点半称为晚上5点半……在连续一个月的超负荷工作之后，胡建斌依然鸡血满满：有幸参加到一场关乎国家命运，关乎民族存亡，抗击疫情的武汉阻击战中，三生有幸！有全国人民支持，一定要打赢，一定能打赢！电话那端的胡建斌，让我想起了加缪的那句话：在隆冬，我终于知道自己身上有一个不可战胜的夏天。
But the 200-strong medical convoy was still running out of capacity, volunteers had to drive day and night, the biological clock was completely disrupted, and after a month of overwork, Hu Jianbin was fortunate enough to take part in the Wuhan Battle against the epidemic.
口述 |胡建斌整理 | 陈　冰志愿者的路，我帮你继续走下去4年前，我开始兼职开滴滴，最近一年半开始做专职滴滴司机，平时每天就要开16个小时左右的车，现在是战时状态，肯定要比平常更辛苦些。
At the drop of a drip four years ago, I started driving part-time for the past year and a half, and now I'm driving about 16 hours a day. It's definitely harder than usual.
晚上还要接凌晨下夜班的医生和护士，所以我一般都是凌晨左右蹲在医院门口，二三点回家睡一会儿，然后6点半起床继续送早班的医生和护士。
There are also doctors and nurses who work late in the morning, so I usually squat in front of the hospital around midnight, go home at two or three, and get up at 6: 30 to continue the morning shift with the doctors and nurses.
说真的，我已经有点分不清到底是凌晨还是深夜。
Seriously, I'm a little confused about whether it's early morning or late at night.
起床以后根本来不及吃早饭，但是防护服、手套、口罩必须穿戴好，再把头天放在84消毒液里浸泡消毒的护目镜戴好，摸黑出门。
After getting up there is no time to eat breakfast, but protective clothing, gloves, masks must be well worn, and head placed in 84 disinfectant dipping goggles wear, black out.
车里一直都有刺鼻的消毒水味道，防护服湿闷，口罩也透不过气来，整个人就像坐在蒸笼里，即使什么也不做，也会一直不断地向外冒汗。
The car smelled of disinfectant all the time, the suits were damp and the mask was suffocating, and the whole person was sitting in a steamer, sweating away, even if he did nothing.
两个小时，我的衣服就会湿透。
My clothes will be wet through in two hours.
但也只能忍上整整一天。
But only for a whole day.
自打实行了禁行令后，私家车就不允许上路了。
Private cars are not allowed to go on the road since the ban was imposed.
整个城市空空荡荡的，街上几乎看不到行人和车，时间好像都停止了，周围安静得只能听见雨水敲打车窗的声音。
The city was empty, pedestrians and cars were barely visible on the streets, time seemed to stop and all was quiet except for the sound of rain beating against the windows.
作为一个土生土长的武汉人，我突然觉得从这个春节开始，武汉有点陌生了。
As a native of Wuhan, I suddenly feel from this Spring Festival, Wuhan a little strange.
那个充满着烟火气的城市，一瞬间，没得了。
The city filled with fireworks, for an instant, no more.
从白天到黑夜，胡建斌一路奔波在各大医院之间，接送医护人员我已经是个年过半百的人了，确实也经历了一些大风大浪。
Day and night, Hu Jianbin all the way between the major hospitals, transport medical personnel I have been over 50 years old, and indeed experienced some big waves.
起先在武钢下属的带钢厂上班，1997年，遭遇国企改制，我和老婆都在武钢工作，必须有一个人下岗。
At first, I worked in a steel mill under WISCO. In 1997, when the state-owned enterprises changed the system, my wife and I both worked in WISCO.
我不能让老婆下岗啊，所以就买断工龄走人了。
I can't let my wife get laid off, so I bought my job age and left.
我去了武汉当时最大的外企丝宝集团当销售。
I went to Wuhan at that time the largest foreign enterprise Sibao Group when sales.
大家都知道的那个感染病毒去世的志愿者何辉，就是我的顶头上司。
The man we all know who died of the virus, Ho Hui, is my immediate superior.
朝夕相伴的人啊，几天就没了，孤零零地一个人走了，火化的时候旁边没有一个人。
Accompanied by the people, a few days after the disappearance of a person alone, cremation when there was no one next to.
我听到这个消息的时候，感觉像被人打了一闷棍，心情糟到了极点，脑子一片空白，好像什么都做不了了，只能枯坐在车里，发呆。
When I heard the news, I felt like someone hit a bludgeon, the mood is terrible, the brain is blank, as if nothing can be done, can only sit in the car, dazed.
根本没有什么感同身受，你不会明白的。
There's no empathy. You don't understand.
网友微博发布的何辉去世消息那时我才刚刚送完一个医生，把车停在小区的停车场里，接下来我必须赶紧把车开到接头点给队员送防疫物资，还有一个单子要完成，时间很紧张。
I had just sent a doctor to park my car in the parking lot of the community. Next I had to run to the junction point to deliver the vaccination materials to the team.
但是那种愤怒、懊恼、无力的感觉让我透不过气来。
But the feeling of anger, chagrin, powerlessness made me suffocate.
结果一不留神，我在小区花坛的拐角把车撞了。
As a result, I accidentally hit the car at the corner of the flower bed in my neighborhood.
还好，只是右后轮撞落了花坛的一大块瓷砖，车身被刮花了，不影响行驶。
Fortunately, only the right rear wheel hit a large piece of flower bed tiles, the body was scratched, do not affect the driving.
我当时就在心里暗暗对何辉说，医护保障志愿者的路，我一定帮你继续走下去。
I was in the heart secretly said to Ho Hui, the way of medical support volunteers, I will help you continue to walk.
我，咋办？滴滴公司定期给我们发放物资，包括防护服、口罩、一次性手套和消毒液。
How do I do? The company distributes supplies to us regularly, including protective clothing, masks, disposable gloves and disinfectant.
不过物资一直紧缺。
But supplies have been scarce.
消毒液，防护服尤其缺。
Sterilization, protective clothing is particularly lacking.
滴滴公司的总裁柳青都在微博发帖为我们这些一线司机求助了。
Liu Qing, president of Drop-Drop, posted on Weibo for help from our front-line drivers.
我第一轮从滴滴公司拿到7套防护服、第二轮只拿到3套，第三轮2套。
In the first round, I received seven suits from Drop-Drop, three in the second and two in the third.
我们只能尽可能地节省，现在一套防护服要穿上3天。
We can only save as much as we can. Now a suit will take three days.
胡建斌经常接单的同济医院中法新城院区专门收治重症病人每天都在接送医务人员，我变得越来越谨慎。
I have become increasingly cautious about the frequent visits to hospitals in Tongji, France, where patients with serious illnesses are being taken in daily.
每次出车前，我要花上近半小时对全车进行消毒。
I spend nearly half an hour disinfecting the whole car before every trip.
我们小区有10多个确诊的，我楼下就有一个。
There are more than ten diagnoses in our neighborhood, and I have one downstairs.
也不知道他们住进医院了没有。
I don't know if they're in the hospital.
每天早出晚归，我已经来不及关心周边的人和事，只想着完成订单，一单，再接一单，能多接送一个是一个。
Every morning and late return, I have no time to care about the people and things around me, just want to complete the order, one order, another order, can send more than one is.
之前，我在地下室停好车，会把护目镜和防护服都脱下去再上楼。
I used to park my car in the basement, take off my goggles and protective clothing and go upstairs.
现在，我觉得所有人都可能是疑似，什么也不敢脱了，就穿着这么一身鼓鼓囊囊的衣服走回家。
Now, I think everyone may be suspected, nothing dare to take off, wearing such a bulging clothes walk home.
进门之前，我会先用消毒液喷洒鞋底，然后用消毒液对一次性防护服进行彻底消毒，第二天我还得继续穿呢。
Before I enter, I spray the sole with disinfectant, then thoroughly disinfect the disposable suit with disinfectant, and I have to continue wearing it the next day.
没得办法啊，现在整个房间里都是消毒水的味道。
I can't help it. Now the whole room smells of disinfectant.
可武汉，哪家不是这样呢？胡建斌忙的时候，连令人反胃的泡面都没空吃吃饭？我们医护保障车队没有定点休息，只能在给车充电的间隙，边等着充电，边找热水泡面。
But Wuhan, which is not so? When Hu Jianbin busy, even the stomach bubble is not free to eat? We do not have a fixed rest, the car can only charge the gap, waiting to charge, while looking for hot water foam.
哪里有热水，就在哪里吃。
Where there is hot water, eat it.
车上、小区、医院都吃过。
Cars, small areas, hospitals have all been eaten.
现在，留守在武汉的每个滴滴司机都害怕再看到泡面。
Now, every drip driver left behind in Wuhan is afraid to see the noodles again.
不论是哪种口味的，闻到那股味道就反胃。
Whatever the taste, it turns your stomach when you smell it.
但忙的时候，连吃泡面都是奢侈的。
But when busy, even eating noodles is a luxury.
物资和工作上的难，我觉得都能承受。
I think I can handle the material and work difficulties.
就是人情世故，难啊，难啊。
It's human. It's hard. It's hard.
大年初四的晚上，住在汉口的表姐打电话给我。
On Thursday night, my cousin who lived in Hankou called me.
他们夫妻俩，六十出头，发热、咳嗽多日，CT显示两人肺部发白。
The couple, in their early sixties, had a fever and coughing for days, and CT showed white lungs.
表姐问我能不能用车子送他们去医院，我为难了半天，但还是直接告诉他们，我的车，只能接送医护人员。
My cousin asked me if I could drive them to the hospital. I was puzzled for a long time, but I told them directly that my car could only carry the paramedics.
没想到，后来又发生了同样的事情。
I didn't expect it to happen again.
我拒绝了一家四口患病的前同事，还有妻子娘家的亲戚。
I turned down four sick ex-colleagues and relatives of my wife's family.
我老婆说我这样子做，把关系都弄僵了。
My wife said I was freezing my relationship by doing it like this.
我连拌嘴的力气都没有了。
I don't even have the strength to quarrel.
这是个原则问题啊。
It's a matter of principle.
我接送的是医护，他们可是要救命的人，万一在我的车上被感染了怎么办？每天深夜到家，都能看到老婆给我留着的一盏灯。
What if I get infected in my car? Every night when I get home, I can see a light my wife keeps for me.
我想，她应该原谅我了吧。
I think she should forgive me.
太——难——了……其实在车上，我一般也不多跟医生护士们聊天。
Too - difficult... actually in the car, I don't usually talk to the doctors and nurses much.
他们都很累了，常常是一上来就瘫坐在后座上。
They were all tired and often collapsed in the back seat as soon as they came up.
不过拉了那么多医护人员，故事肯定还是有的。
But with so many paramedics, there must be a story.
一位小护士在车上跟我说，自己独自照顾6个床位的病人已经吃不消了，现在又被增加了2个床位的工作量，真的是累到崩溃。
A small nurse told me that after six-bed patients were no longer able to take care of themselves, the two-bed workload was creeping up.
我说我把车开得慢一点，你可以眯一会儿。
I said I'd slow the car down a bit. You can have a squint.
2月6日晚上，我接到了一个12公里外的派单，我到达上车地点仁爱医院时，发现医院已经被隔离，大门上写着大大的“封闭”二字，情况看起来很严重。
On the evening of February 6, I received a delivery order from a distance of 12 kilometers. When I got to the humane society hospital where I got on the bus, I found the hospital isolated with a big "closed" sign on the door.
一个女的，拿着几个包走了过来，可她不是叫车人，按照滴滴医护叫车系统的规定，为了避免共同乘坐造成交叉感染，禁止同乘或代叫。
A woman came by with a few bags, but she wasn't a car-caller. In order to avoid cross-infection caused by sharing, co-multiplication or substitution was prohibited.
我就不让她上车。
I won't let her on the bus.
万一她是病人，我这个车就是一个流动带毒车，后面乘坐的医护就有危险。
If she were a patient, my car would be a mobile, poisoned car, and the medical attention behind would be in danger.
结果她给我出示了自己的护士证，说是同事帮她叫的车。
As a result, she showed me her nurse's card, saying that her colleague had called her car.
我心软了，打开所有的车窗，让她上了车。
My heart softened. I opened all the windows and let her get on the bus.
“我连续工作了三天，刚刚晕倒了。
"I've been working for three days straight and I just fainted.
”刚上车，女护士就跟我说，本来她拿着包裹，是为长期作战准备的，没想到刚连轴转了三天，身体就出现状况了。
"No sooner had she got on the bus than the nurse told me that she had been carrying the parcel for a long battle, but after only three days on the turn of an axis, she was in a condition.
她觉得自己有可能“中招”了。
She thought she might have hit the jackpot.
我当时很着急，告诉她这种情况应该叫救护车，或者自行前往隔离酒店。
I was in a hurry and told her that I should call an ambulance or go to the quarantine hotel on my own.
并且提醒她，在病毒高发区工作，不应该带杂物回家，何况家里还有孩子。
And remind her to work in high-prevalence areas, should not bring home groceries, not to mention children at home.
女护士在车上哭得稀里哗啦的，一时间也六神无主了，然后又开始埋怨我……车内压抑的气氛让我们都有点失控，我告诉自己，冷静，冷静，不要骂娘。
The female nurses cried in the car, for a while, and then began to blame me... The atmosphere of depression in the car let us all a little out of control, I told myself, calm, calm, do not curse.
好巧不巧，她的手机又没电了。
Unfortunately, her cell phone has run out of electricity again.
我赶紧打电话联系她老公，让他做好防护措施出来对接。
I hastened to call her husband and ask him to come out and dock with protective measures.
所幸后来证实只是虚惊一场，女护士没事儿。
Fortunately, it turned out to be a fake. The nurse was okay.
还有一位姓曾的医生，在我们接送他上下班之前，靠自己的腿足足走了三天的路。
There was also a doctor named Zeng who had covered three days on his own legs before we took him to work.
他所在的武汉市第三医院和社区距离7公里，他走得慢，每天要徒步走3个小时。
He walked slowly, walking three hours a day at Wuhan City's Third Hospital and the community, 7 kilometers away.
大年初四，曾医生无法坚持下去，只好打电话叫车了。
At the beginning of the year, Dr. Zeng couldn't hold on and had to call for a bus.
我们问他，为啥不叫车呢？他说我不好意思麻烦你们，但我实在是走不动了……这真的是，太——难——了。
We asked him why he didn't call for a car? He said I was sorry to bother you, but I couldn't walk... It was really, too - difficult.
滴滴司机以自己的方式默默关心乘车的医护人员，而车的后座上也常常会有医护们留下的礼物——饼干、牛奶、八宝粥或者是一枚珍贵的N95口罩耐心等待着拐点的到来我就是典型的武汉人，性子急，心肠热。
The drip-drip driver quietly cares for the paramedics in his own way, and the back seat of the car often contains gifts from medical staff - cookies, milk, porridge or a precious N95 mask - waiting patiently for the inflection point to arrive.
2015年，我在武汉一家口罩公司，负责华北地区的销售。
In 2015, I was in charge of sales in North China at a mask company in Wuhan.
天津发生“812滨海新区大爆炸”的时候，我当天晚上就领着同事，送去了40万只口罩。
Tianjin "812 Binhai New Area Big Bang", I led colleagues that night, sent 400,000 masks.
在天津呆了一个星期，就是不停地给需要的人发口罩。
After a week in Tianjin, I kept giving people the masks they needed.
作为接送医护人员的次高危人群，胡建斌非常注重自己和队友的防护今天的武汉，形势比当初的天津严峻得多。
As a sub-high-risk group to transport medical personnel, Hu Jianbin attaches great importance to their own and teammates' protection today Wuhan, the situation is much more serious than the original Tianjin.
口罩，成了护命的硬通货。
Masks have become the hard currency of life.
一天，一位护士在车上和我闲聊，说在同济医院中法新城院区有司机没有穿防护服、戴护目镜。
One day, a nurse chatted with me on the bus about the absence of protective clothing and goggles for drivers at Tongji Hospital.
作为车队长的我气坏了，中法新城院区是收治危重病人的，医护都是极高危人群。
As the captain of the car I was angry, the French-Chinese Xincheng District is the admission of critically ill people, medical care is extremely high-risk groups.
我赶紧在群里发了一堆消息，提醒他们：我们是次高危人群，一定要高度注意自身防护措施。
I quickly sent a pile of messages in the group, reminding them that we are a sub-high-risk group, we must pay great attention to their own protective measures.
我们医护保障首发战队，一定要做到零感染、零伤亡，全胜归来！！！为了更好地防护隔离我们这些在前线的车队兄弟们，2月11日开始，滴滴公司在我们的车上安装防护隔离膜了。
We care for the first team, we must achieve zero infection, zero casualties, return home!!! To better protect and isolate us in the front line of the convoy brothers, February 11, drip companies in our vehicles installed protective barrier film.
胡建斌的车子已经装好了防护膜他们向医护人员和专业人士请教过，说是在车内加装塑料隔离膜一定程度上可以防止飞沫传播。
Mr. Hu's car has been fitted with a protective film. They consulted health-care workers and professionals to say that the plastic film was added to the car to prevent the spread of froth.
这也是特殊时期的笨办法，虽然看上去有点简陋，但也算一种不错的尝试了。
It's also a stupid way to go through a special time, and while it may seem a bit crude, it's a good attempt.
多一重保护，就多一点安全吧。
More protection, more safety.
形势依然很严峻。
The situation remains grave.
现在的武汉就在生死边缘，没有那么多考虑的东西，大家无非就是默默地干。
Wuhan is now on the edge of life and death, there is not so much to consider things, we do nothing but silently.
所有留下来的人，都要让自己真实。
Let all who remain be true to themselves.
病人住进病房，健康的人呆在屋里头，医护上前线，我们行驶在街头上，这就是各司其职。
Patients are admitted to wards, healthy people stay indoors, medical attention is on the front lines, and we drive on the streets, and that's what we do.
我们正在进行一场惨烈的战斗。
We are engaged in a fierce battle.
封城已经近一个月了，当初看到封城通知时，完全没有想过会这么久。
The city has been closed for nearly a month, the first to see the closure notice, completely did not think that it would take so long.
时至今日，大家好像也开始适应关门闭户的生活，我们都在耐心等待着拐点的到来。
Today, everyone seems to have begun to adapt to the closed door life, we are waiting patiently for the inflection point.
