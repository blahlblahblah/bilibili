深度和角度——这就是我们能做的。
Depth and angle - that's what we can do.

海啸和疾病，都让我们再次注意到自己是自然的一部分。
Tsunamis and diseases remind us once again that we are part of nature.
记者| 孔冰欣南洋爪哇岛的热带丛林，金发的战俘向他走来。
A blonde prisoner of war approached him in the tropical jungle of KongBingxin's southern Java island.
而他泄露天机的颤抖的眸色里，那段细碎、幽玄、物哀的配乐，早已砌下落樱如雪乱，乱云飞渡，渡不了方寸间无憾的圆满。
And his shudder eye color, that piece of broken, mysterious, the music of mourning, has been the fall of cherry trees, chaos, flying across the clouds, can not reach between no regrets between the perfect.
辗转北京、大连、长春，人去夕阳斜的帝国暮色中，有找不到的阿嬷、被藏起来的蛐蛐、半生是非转头空的怅然与释然。
Rolling Beijing, Dalian, Changchun, people to the sunset in the Imperial Twilight, there are not found grandmother, hidden cricket, half a life of non-turning empty with sense of relief.
有幕后的一架走音的钢琴，和两周时间创作、录制了四十余首曲子的他。
Behind the scenes was an out-of-tune piano, and for two weeks he composed and recorded more than forty pieces of music.
他既是上世纪70年代末第一支从日本火到西方的三人乐队YMO（Yellow Magic Orchestra）的成员（学历最高，获“教授”昵称），年轻时兼具古典、先锋、突破、反叛的特质。
He was both a member of the first three-man band, Yellow Magic Orchestra, from Japanese fire to the West in the late 1970s (with the highest education and a nickname "Professor"), and young with a mixture of classical, avant-garde, breakthrough, and rebellious qualities.
也是阅尽繁华后淡淡、温和的老者，信奉“调出自然，万物生音”。

把塑料桶倒扣在头上听雨滴的叩打，向海螺吹送轻风，漫步树林里，踩在叶堆上。
Knock the plastic bucket upside down on your head and let the wind blow on the conch, walk through the trees and tread on the heaps of leaves.

坂本龙一。
Sakamoto.
才华、傲慢、不设边界，还有帅，让他几乎拥有了一个文艺icon所需要拥有的一切。
Talent, arrogance, no boundaries, and good looks gave him almost everything a literary icon needed.
2018年，他来过一次中国。
He came to China once in 2018.
当时，京城文化界的各位大V，基本上都转发了与他相关的微博。
At that time, the cultural circles of the capital, the big V, basically forwarded the micro-blog related to him.
2020年，他关心着疫情中的中国家庭，又适时献上了自己的一曲《Aqua》。
In 2020, he was concerned about Chinese families in the midst of the epidemic and duly presented his own "Aqua."
事情缘起于北京当代艺术基金会与夏季之声共同发起的“妈妈爸爸生活节2020爱心版”。
It started with the Beijing Foundation for Contemporary Art's 2020 Love Edition, which was launched by the Beijing Contemporary Art Foundation and Voice of Summer.
在春节以来最艰难的日子里，许多卓越的跨界艺术家与创作者，通过在线/视频/直播平台的形式，与宅家“禁闭”的父母、孩子们，分享了艺术的力量。
In the toughest days since the Spring Festival, many prominent cross-border artists and creators have shared the power of art with their homeowners' parents and children in an online / video / live broadcast platform.
2月22日，北京当代艺术基金会发布了坂本龙一演奏“Aqua”的视频。
On 22 February, the Beijing Foundation for Contemporary Art released a video of Sakamoto performing "Aqua."
值得一提的是，“Aqua”出自坂本龙一二十年前的“治愈系”专辑“BTTB”（指的是Back To The Basic，返璞归真，“专辑中有一部分音乐，使我想起了自己的童年”），是其代表作之一。
It is worth mentioning that "Aqua" is one of Sakamoto's masterpieces from his "Healing Department" album "BTTB" (Back to Earth, "a part of the album that reminds me of my childhood") a decade or two ago.
Play他留下了一段鼓励中国小朋友的话：“不能出门玩耍很难过吧，但既然现在不用去学校了，就在家尽情做好玩的事吧。
Play left a message of encouragement to Chinese children: "It's sad not to go out and play, but since you don't have to go to school now, do your best at home.
不要只是玩游戏哦，用这些时间，去读很多书，听很多音乐。
Don't just play games. Take the time to read lots of books and listen to lots of music.
画画，写诗，弹奏乐器，看电影也是不错的选择。
Drawing, writing poetry, playing musical instruments and watching movies are also good choices.
还有别忘了在家里做一点体操运动。
And don't forget to do some gymnastics at home.
努力渡过难关吧。
Try to get through this.
”坂本龙一还寄语，知道现在对每一个人来说都是难熬的时刻，但希望大家能够尽量不要慌乱，把握情况，冷静地行动。
Sakamoto also sent a message, knowing that this was a tough time for everyone, but hoped everyone would try not to panic, grasp the situation and act calmly.
虽然要和身边的人“保持距离”，我们还是可以守望相助。
Although we have to "keep a distance" from the people around us, we can still keep an eye on each other.
由衷地祈祷不要再有更多的人遭受不幸。
Pray from the bottom of my heart that no more people will suffer.
一定要平安。
You must be safe.
2月29日晚，坂本龙一在另一场线上音乐会上使用的乐器火了——“中国武汉制造”的吊钹。
On the evening of 29 February, Sakamoto used a string of cymbals from "Made in Wuhan, China," an instrument used at another online concert.
曲终，教授对着镜头，用中文说：“大家，加油！”快“奔七”的坂本龙一，因为贝托鲁奇的电影《末代皇帝》作配乐而为中国的普罗大众所知。
At the end of the song, the professor looked into the camera and said in Chinese: "Come on, people!" Sakamoto, who was running seven, was known to the general public in China for the score of Bertrand's film The Last Emperor.
《末代皇帝》为他赢得了第60届奥斯卡最佳原创配乐奖，而他和贝托鲁奇再次合作的《遮蔽的天空》，则拿到了第48届美国电影电视金球奖的最佳电影配乐奖。
"The Last Emperor" won him the 60th Academy Award for Best Original soundtrack, while "Shaded Sky," in which he and Bertolucci collaborated once again, won the 48th annual Motion Picture and Television Golden Globe Award for best supporting film.
此外，他曾为巴塞罗那奥运会开幕式谱曲并担任指挥，也是小李子苦心志劳筋骨玩水枪终喜摘奥斯卡影帝桂冠的那部《荒野猎人》的音乐监制。
In addition, he composed and conducted the opening ceremony of the Barcelona Olympics, and was the music producer for Little Plum, the music director of "The Wilderness Hunter," who won the Oscar for playing the water gun.
当然，对很多因为“Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence”而入坑的粉丝来说，教授是自带bgm的男人，大卫·鲍伊再妖，在这部电影里，也没能妖过那绵绵音符里的无尽情思。
Of course, for many fans of "Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence," the professor is a man with his own bgm, David Boyce, and in this film, has not been able to sift through the endless love notes.
除了音乐、电影，坂本龙一更对种族、战争、环境和气候等议题，始终保持着关注。
In addition to music, movies, Sakamoto more on issues such as race, war, the environment and climate, has always been a concern.
充满激情的青年时代，他热衷左翼理论、积极投身社会活动。
In his passionate youth, he was passionate about left-wing theory and social activism.
四十多年后，日本经历了“3·11”大地震后的福岛核泄漏事故，置身于反核示威人群，他感叹，（日本）已经好多年“没有过这样的反抗行动了”。
More than 40 years later, Japan experienced the Fukushima nuclear disaster after the March 11, 2001, earthquake and was among the anti-nuclear protesters, lamenting that "there has been no such resistance" for many years.
2014年，坂本龙一确诊咽喉癌。
In 2014, Sakamoto was diagnosed with laryngeal cancer.
作为癌症幸存者，他对疾病有着切身的痛感，提及“曾在化疗时放声痛哭”。
As a cancer survivor, he felt the pain of his illness and referred to "crying during chemotherapy."
他坦承自己是一个软弱的人，但软弱不等于无能，也许，这样的“软弱”，恰恰触发了更多同理心，包括对这次疫情的。
He acknowledges that he is a weak man, but weakness does not mean incompetence, and perhaps such "weakness" has triggered more empathy, including in this case.
事实上，和他最喜欢的日本历史人物夏目漱石一样，坂本龙一复杂、敏感，经常处在一种中间的位置，那是东方和西方的中间，也是传统和现代的中间，更是公众和个人的中间。
In fact, like his favorite Japanese historical figure, summer mouthwash, Sakamoto was a complex, sensitive and often middle place, between East and West, between tradition and modernity, and between the public and the individual.
希望教授就这么静静地走下去。
I hope the professor goes on so quietly.
头发依旧浓密，眉目依旧动人，做音乐的时候，笑得依旧天真。
Hair is still thick, eyebrows still moving, when making music, smile still naive.
近日，坂本龙一接受了《新民周刊》的专访，谈了谈他对疫情、对音乐的一些思考。
Recently, Sakamoto once accepted "Xinmin Weekly" interview, talked about his epidemic, some thoughts on music.
《新民周刊》：你从纽约专门录制钢琴音乐现场视频，为战疫中的中国人鼓劲。
NEWSWEEK: You recorded a live video of piano music from New York to encourage the Chinese people during the war.
之所以选择“Aqua”这首曲子，有什么特殊的用意吗？坂本龙一：其实这次录制了“Aqua”和“Energy flow”两首曲子，因为“Aqua”的录制质量更好，所以选择了它。
What was the special meaning of the song "Aqua"? Sakamoto: In fact, this time recorded "Aqua" and "Energy Flow," because the "Aqua" recording quality is better, so chose it.
在疫情蔓延的戾气之中，我想这两首曲子可以让听者的心情平静一些。
In the heat of the epidemic, I think these two pieces of music can calm the listener's mood.
《新民周刊》：新冠肺炎疫情暴发以来，日本方面种种援助行为令中国人感动。
NEW MING WEEKLY: Since the outbreak of the outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia, the Chinese have been moved by Japanese aid.
而面对疫情渐渐不容乐观的日本，在日华人也开始走上街头，为日本朋友免费发放口罩。
In Japan, where the epidemic is beginning to blight, Chinese are taking to the streets to give free masks to Japanese friends.
中日两国一衣带水，你如何理解这“投我以桃，报之以李”的情感？你对两国间的关系，有怎样的期许？坂本龙一：新型冠状病毒疫情对两国来说都是严峻的考验，希望在两国互相帮助的状况下，国民间也可以更了解彼此，增进感情。
How do you understand the feeling of "throw me peaches and serve plums"? What are your hopes for the relationship between the two countriesSakamoto: The new coronavirus outbreak is a severe test for both countries.
这就是中文里说的“塞翁失马，焉知非福”吧。
This is the Chinese saying that "a blessing in disguise."
《新民周刊》：当下的世界面临疫情的巨大挑战，你觉得艺术抗疫的作用，主要体现在哪些方面？坂本龙一：艺术和音乐，不具备实际生产能力，也不能用来果腹。
What do you think about the role of art in combating pandemics? Sakamoto: Art and music have no real production capacity and cannot be used to feed their stomachs.
然而从人类在这颗星球上诞生的那一刻起，我们就从未中断过从事艺术和音乐相关的活动。
Yet from the moment we were born on this planet, we have never ceased to engage in art and music-related activities.
我也不知道理由是什么，但人类的生存，离不开艺术和音乐，这就是不争的事实吧。
I don't know what the reason is, but it is an indisputable fact that art and music are indispensable to human existence.
《新民周刊》：这次，你的音乐，不仅为家长们演奏，也为孩子们演奏。
NEWSWEEK: This time, your music is playing not only for parents, but also for children.
艺术如何拉近代际距离、促进爱的交流？坂本龙一：也许是因为音乐是从0岁的婴儿到老人，都可以一起拍手，一起晃动身体，来享受的吧。
How does art bring generations closer together and promote love communion? Sakamoto: Maybe because music is from a 0-year-old baby to an old man, you can clap your hands together, shake your body, and enjoy it.
即使彼此语言不通，也可以一起沉醉在音乐里。
Even if each other can not understand the language, can also be absorbed in music together.
《新民周刊》：你想对被疫情所困的人们送出什么建议和祝福？坂本龙一：病毒的预防和应对方法请听取专业人士的意见，我也会这样做。
NEWSWEEK: What advice and blessing do you want to send to people who are suffering from the epidemic? Sakamoto: Please listen to professionals for advice on how to prevent and respond to the virus. I will do the same.
几年前我因为一场大病，时隔几十年突然有了很多闲暇时间，在这段时间里听了许多之前从未听过的作曲家的音乐。
A few years ago I suddenly had a lot of free time after decades because of a serious illness, during which I listened to many composers I had never heard before.
有了许多的新发现，喜欢的音乐也变得更多了。
With so many new discoveries, my favorite music has become more and more popular.
我想大家在日常繁忙的学习和工作中，应该有许多想要做却没做的事情吧，利用这段时间去深入地尝试一下呢？《新民周刊》：人类在面对未知的病毒和根深蒂固的顽症时，显得那么脆弱。
I think there should be a lot of things you want to do but don't do in your busy day-to-day work and study. Take this time to try it out.New People's Weekly: Humans are so vulnerable to unknown viruses and deep-rooted diseases.
这次疫情暴发让我们措手不及，而2014年，你被查出喉癌。
The outbreak took us by surprise, and in 2014, you were diagnosed with laryngeal cancer.
你现在怎么看待生死问题？坂本龙一：我每天需要花不少心力去处理日常工作和琐事，很少会去思考生死这样的长远深刻的问题，然而当疾病和像这次的疫情一样非日常的状况突然发生的时候，我想每个人都不得不去思考这些问题。
What do you think of life and death? Sakamoto: I spend a lot of time every day working on my daily tasks and trifles, rarely thinking about such profound issues as life and death, but when things suddenly come up like this one, I think everyone has to think about them.
实际上我也对罹患癌症这件事心存感激，因为它让我再一次意识到平常被遗忘的重要事情：我的生命，以及我的身体，是从属于自然的。
In fact, I am grateful for the cancer because it reminds me once again of the important things that are often forgotten: my life, and my body, is subordinate to nature.
《新民周刊》：你学古典音乐出身，却成为了日本现代音乐的推动者和革新者，风格多变。
NEWSWEEK: You studied classical music, but you became a promoter and innovator of modern Japanese music, with a variety of styles.
其实，你年轻时也是左翼热血青年，看毛泽东的著作，听左派马克思主义者柄谷行人的讲座。
In fact, when you were young, you were also a young man of left-wing blood, reading Mao Zedong's writings and listening to lectures by leftist Marxists.
左翼思想是否直接影响了你的音乐？坂本龙一：我想没有直接的影响。
Does left-wing thinking directly influence your music? Sakamoto: I don't think it has a direct impact.
年轻的时候，我觉得自己做的音乐是否也应该是有政治意味的，思考过什么是有政治意味的音乐。
When I was young, I wondered if the music I made should also be political, thinking about what was politically significant.
但后来我的想法也发生了变化，音乐虽然会受到当时的政治、经济或者是媒体的影响，然而制作音乐本身，有音乐的理论、语法和感情去支撑，不需要过度受到政治或经济等外部因素的影响。
But then my thinking changed, and while music was influenced by politics, economics or the media of the time, there were theories, grammatical and emotional underpinnings to making the music itself, without undue influence from external factors such as politics or economics.
《新民周刊》：创作音乐、出演电影，似乎你干什么，都能干成。
NEWSWEEK: You can make music and movies as if you could do anything.
因此，当年的你心高气傲，不过，你在接受媒体采访时，坦言现在的自己不会和那时的自己做朋友。
So you were proud of yourself, but when you were interviewed by the media, you confessed that you would not be friends with yourself at the time.
你觉得曾经的反叛不够有深度？现在呢，是否足够沉淀了？坂本龙一：对，我觉得自己年轻的时候是一个非常自私而傲慢的家伙。
You think the rebellion wasn't deep enough? Now, is it deep enough? Sakamoto: Yes, I thought I was a very selfish and arrogant guy when I was young.
如果现在我遇到年轻时候的自己，会觉得这家伙是实在太自以为是了，也不会愿意跟他交朋友。
If I met my young self now, I'd think this guy was too smug to make friends with him.
《新民周刊》：在中国，你最被人熟知的是电影《末代皇帝》的配乐。
NEWSWEEK: In China, you're best known for the soundtrack to the film The Last Emperor.
同时，你最经典的曲目之一“Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence”，也让中国的文艺青年百听不厌。
At the same time, one of your classic repertoire, "Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence," also appeals to young Chinese writers and artists.
这首“Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence”，你是否会演奏到“审美疲劳”“不堪忍受”？在创作生涯里，你有最偏爱的专辑或曲子吗？坂本龙一：尤其是在制作了“Merry Christmas Mr. Laurence”的主题曲之后，因为大家都只要求听这首曲子，我不高兴再弹它，大概有10年左右的时间没有再弹过。
Do you have a favorite album or song in your creative career? Sakamoto: Especially after the production of the theme song "Merry Christmas Mr. Laurence," I'm not happy to play it again, about a decade or so.
自己写的音乐都像自己的孩子一样，不会有亲疏之分，也不存在最喜欢哪首了。
I write music like their own children, there will be no distinction between relatives, there is no favorite one.
《新民周刊》：2011年，福岛核泄漏事件后，你和朋友在现场找到一架曾被海啸淹没过的钢琴，这架钢琴已经严重走音，但你还是用它弹奏了一首不安、短促，甚至有些刺耳的音乐。
NEW MINE WEEKLY: In 2011, after the Fukushima accident, you and your friends found a piano that had been swamped by the tsunami and was badly out of tune, but you used it to play a restless, short, even harsh piece of music.
如今，你更追求一种“自然的声音”，比较排斥人为的校准，为什么？你觉得自然生态和人类文明的矛盾是难以调和的吗？坂本龙一：在我看来，人类就是稍微偏离了一点自然轨道的（有点儿坏掉的）猴子。
Today, you prefer a "natural voice" rather than artificial calibration, why do you think the contradiction between natural ecology and human civilization is irreconcilable? Sakamoto: In my opinion, humans are just a little out of line with the natural world.
不愿遵从自然原理而活，而是总想着要勉强制造出自己独特的环境。
Do not want to live by the principles of nature, but always want to reluctantly create their own unique environment.
文明如此，金钱、音乐也是如此，都不是自然的产物。
Civilization is like this. So is money and music. Neither is it a product of nature.
而海啸和疾病，都让我们再次注意到自己是自然的一部分。
Tsunamis and disease, however, remind us that we are part of nature again.
《新民周刊》：你是否认为人们不再严肃思考，不再关心沉重话题？坂本龙一：全世界都有这样的倾向，经济的速度和节奏在支配着生活。
NEWSWEEK: Do you think people don't think seriously anymore and don't care about heavy topics anymore? Sakamoto: There's a worldwide tendency for the speed and pace of the economy to dominate life.
我想人们应该尝试着放慢自己的脚步。
I think people should try to slow down.
制作音乐和思考哲学，需要充足的时间。
It takes time to make music and to think about philosophy.
培育森林，养育孩子也是如此。
The same is true of nurturing forests and raising children.
《新民周刊》：去年，纪录片《坂本龙一：终曲》在中国院线上映，记录了你在2012-2017年之间的生活轨迹。
NEW MING WEEKLY: Last year, the documentary Sakamoto: The Finale opened in Chinese theaters, recording your life from 2012 to 2017.
那么能说说近两年你的生活状态吗？下一阶段，你又有哪些新的计划？坂本龙一：有好多同时进行的项目，不能一次说清。
So what's your life like in the last two years? What new plans do you have? Sakamoto: There are a lot of concurrent projects that can't be explained at once.
最近有点太忙了，我也需要放慢脚步，希望可以努力用充足的时间来集中做一件事。
I'm a bit too busy these days, and I need to slow down and try to focus on one thing with enough time.
