在线教育行业突然涌入海量的师生将深刻影响中国教育未来2月11日，山东省滨州市博兴县第三中学的工作人员利用电脑端实时监控“网络直播教学”进程，随时提供直播技术支持。
The sudden influx of students and teachers into online education will have a profound impact on education in China.On Feb. 11, staff at Boxing County Middle School in Boxing, Shandong Province, used computers to monitor the live webcasting process and provide live technical support at any time.
2020年春季学期开学延期，博兴县第三中学利用网络直播设备搭建“网络直播教室”，组织教室按照课程轮值在“网络直播教室”当上“教学主播”。
In the spring of 2020, when the start of the school year was postponed, Boxing County High School set up "webcasting classrooms" using live webcasting equipment, and organized classrooms to work as "teaching anchors" in "webcasting classrooms" on a rotating basis.

Photo / Chinese New Online Education "Normandy Landing" Our correspondent / Sujid published in 2020.3.9, issue No. 938 of China News Weekly entered March, and many schools still do not see any hope of starting school.
疫情之下，教育是受波及面最广的行业之一。
Education is one of the sectors most affected by the epidemic.
开学时间已经多次被延期，仍然没有明确时间表。
The start of the school year has been extended several times and there is still no clear timetable.
教育部在1月27日发布通知，宣布春季学期延期开学。
The Ministry of Education issued a circular on 27 January announcing the postponement of the spring term.
2月28日，教育部再次印发通知，要求“全国大中小学、幼儿园等开学时间原则上继续推迟。
On 28 February, the Ministry of Education again issued a circular demanding that "the opening of schools, colleges and kindergartens throughout the country continue to be postponed in principle.
”这意味着，全国超过3亿师生，无法返校。
This means that more than 300 million teachers and students nationwide cannot return to school.
根据教育部2019年7月公布的《全国教育事业发展统计公报》，2018年全国各级各类学历教育在校生2.76亿人，全国各级各类学校专任教师1672.85万人，其中义务教育阶段在校生1.5亿人。
According to the National Bulletin of Statistics on the Development of Education published by the Ministry of Education in July 2019, by 2018 there were 276 million students in all types of academic education nationwide and 16,728,500 full-time teachers at all levels and in all types of schools, 150 million of whom were enrolled in compulsory education.
为了应对延期开学，教育部给出的解决方案是：利用网络平台，停课不停学。
In response to the delay in starting classes, the Ministry of Education has proposed a solution: use the Internet platform, non-stop learning.
“停课不停学”的通知直接引爆了在线教育的热潮，全国各地数以亿计的师生涌入互联网课堂。
The announcement of "non-stop learning" has triggered an online education frenzy, with hundreds of millions of students and teachers pouring into internet classrooms across the country.
一千多万老师摇身一变，成为网络主播，两亿多学生成为“粉丝”。
More than 10 million teachers have turned into webmasters and more than 200 million students have become fans.
“这是一次大规模的教育实验，直接把在线教育往前推进了一大步。
"This is a massive educational experiment that takes online education a big step forward.
” 全国政协常委、副秘书长、民进中央副主席朱永新告诉《中国新闻周刊》。
Zhu Yongxin, the Standing Committee of the CPPCC, deputy secretary-general and vice-chairman of DPP, told China News Weekly.
在线教育可能给中国教育带来一次“诺曼底登陆”，在传统教育之外开辟第二战场。
Online education could bring a "Normandy landing" to Chinese education, opening up a second battleground to traditional education.
“抢滩”网课2月27日，湖北省襄阳市高二学生韩金宇坐在家中书桌前，通过在线教育工具钉钉观看老师的讲课，聊天框时不时弹出同学提出的问题，网络另一端的老师实时进行解答。
Han Jinyu, a high school sophomore in Xiangyang, Hubei province, sat at his desk on Feb. 27 by tacking into a teacher's lecture with an online educational tool. The chat box then popped up questions from his classmates and the teacher at the other end of the network answered them in real time.
这样的学习方式，他已经进行了两周，离高考还有一年多时间，他已经进入“倒计时”。
Such a way of learning, he has been conducted for two weeks, more than a year before the college entrance examination, he has entered the "countdown."
对于韩金宇来说，这个寒假格外漫长。
For Han Jinyu, this winter vacation is particularly long.
以往这个时候，他应该坐在教室里听老师讲课，下课后回寝室和室友聊天打闹。
At this time in the past, he should sit in the classroom to listen to the teacher, after class back bedroom and roommate chatting and fighting.
然而，新冠肺炎疫情席卷全国，为了防控疫情，人们不得不待在家中抗“疫”，正常生活节奏也被打乱。
However, the New Crown Pneumonia epidemic spread across the country, in order to prevent and control the epidemic, people had to stay at home against the "epidemic," the normal pace of life was disrupted.
“这时候，在线教育相对于线下机构的优势和便捷性便体现了出来，很多家长将目光转向了在线教育。
"At this point, the advantages and convenience of online versus offline education are evident, and many parents are looking to online education.
”校外培训机构VIPKID少儿研究院执行院长李国训告诉《中国新闻周刊》。
Li Guoshu, executive director of the VIPKID institute for children outside school, told China News Weekly.
韩金宇用的钉钉，是此次在线教育App人气最高的软件之一。
One of the most popular software for online education, App, is the nail.
钉钉原本是阿里巴巴旗下的一款办公软件，疫情期间，紧急上线了“在家上课”功能。
Nailing was originally Alibaba's office software, during the outbreak, emergency online "lessons at home" function.
钉钉教育线负责人方永新（花名大炮）告诉《中国新闻周刊》，2月中旬，已经有5000多万学生在用钉钉在线上课。
Fang Yongxin, head of the nail-nailing education line, told China News Weekly that more than 50 million students had been nailed online in mid-February.
相比之下，从2015年发布到2019年上半年，钉钉用了五年时间才达到2亿用户的规模。
By contrast, it took five years from the launch in 2015 to the first half of 2019 to reach the size of 200 million users.
钉钉“在家上课”计划非常强大，覆盖在线授课、在线提交批改作业、在线考试等应用场景，而且免费让全国大中小学使用。
The nail-in-the-house program is powerful, covering applications such as online classes, online submissions and exams, and is available free of charge to schools and colleges across the country.
不过，这些“强大的功能”遭到了很多中小学生的抗议，学生们普遍反映假期休息时间被霸占、被要求强制下载注册、钉钉侵入个人隐私太多。
But these "powerful functions" have met with protests from schoolchildren, who generally complain about vacation breaks, mandatory downloads and tacks that invade too much privacy.
学生们疯狂在各大App应用市场打出1星“好评”，几乎在一夜之间，钉钉在应用商店的评分就从4.9跌到了1.3。
Students frantically hit the App app market with a one-star "good word," falling from 4.9 to 1.3 in the App Store almost overnight.
对于被打低分，方永新表示很理解，他女儿甚至还写了很多针对钉钉的建议，“仔细看了很多小朋友的帖子，写得非常有才。
Fang Yongxin understands the low marks, and his daughter has even written a lot of suggestions for nails, "carefully read many children's posts, write very talented.
”突如其来的疫情，为整个在线教育按下了快进键。
"Sudden epidemic, for the entire online education pressed the fast key.
不仅是阿里巴巴，其他互联网巨头也冲入教育市场，争夺庞大的流量。
Not only Alibaba, other Internet giants also rushed into the education market, vying for huge traffic.

App, the online ape-counseling service for apes, launched the National Model for One Million People online on Feb. 15, taking a record 1.23 million secondary school students.
老牌教育培训机构也推出了免费的大班直播和录播课。
Long-established educational and training institutions also offer free large-scale broadcast and video classes.
好未来、新东方等机构通过捐赠课程、服务，设立教育基金等形式争夺流量。
Good future, New Oriental and other institutions through the donation of courses, services, the establishment of education funds and other forms of competition for traffic.
新东方董事长俞敏洪还订购了手机支架、灯光等直播设备，在快手平台开启个人直播首秀，化身“网红”给学生和家长讲课。
Yu Minhong, New Oriental chairman, also ordered cell phone scaffolding, lighting and other live equipment to open a live personal show on the fast-track platform, incarnate "netizen" to teach students and parents.
俞敏洪在接受媒体采访时透露，在疫情发生后的一周之内，新东方将87所分校、子公司，接近200万人次学生全部转移到了线上。
In an interview with the media, Yu told reporters that within a week of the outbreak, New Oriental had moved 87 branch schools and subsidiaries, with nearly two million students, onto the line.
这个过程中，服务器扩容了好几次，旗下三个平台总承载量1000万人次，整体运行平稳，最终把退课率控制在了3％左右。
During this process, the server has expanded several times, the total carrying capacity of its three platforms 10 million, the overall operation of a stable, eventually to control the drop-out rate in about 3%.
东方优播是新东方旗下在线教育公司，主营中小学在线小班互动直播课程。
Orient Youcheng is a New Oriental online education company, the main primary and secondary online small class interactive live courses.
东方优播CEO朱宇告诉《中国新闻周刊》：“这次的流量效应，远远超过了几大在线教育公司去年暑假耗资几十亿元打出来的效果。
"The traffic effects far outweigh the billions spent last summer by major online education companies," Zhu Yu, chief executive of Eastern YouTube, told China News Weekly.
如果用数字估算的话，相当于替互联网教育机构省了近千亿元的推广费。
Numerical calculations would have saved nearly $100 billion in promotional costs for Internet-based educational institutions.
”资本市场上，在线教育也成为“宠儿”。
Online education has also become a favorite in capital markets.
刚在美股上市不久的网易有道于2月7日、10日连续暴涨，短短2个交易日涨幅超80％，其他在线教育的中概股股价也持续上扬。
Netease, which has just made its debut in the U.S. stock market, jumped more than 80% in just two trading days on Feb. 7 and Feb. 10, while stocks of other online-education stocks continued to rise.
2月10日，武汉市水果湖二小的学生通过直播云系统上课。
February 10, Wuhan City Shuiguohu two primary school students through the live cloud system.
当日起，武汉中小学（中职学校）按照教学计划，开展在线教学。
From that day on, Wuhan primary and secondary schools (secondary vocational schools) in accordance with the teaching plan, online teaching.
摄影/湖北日报 田悦技术“攻坚战”2月2日上午10点，天津华英学校正在进行寒假班第3天的课程，直播软件突然出现了大规模卡顿，持续了大概40分钟。
Photo / Hubei Daily Tian Yue Technology "Tian Yan battle" Feb. 2, 10: 00 am, Tianjin Huaying School is conducting the third day of winter vacation classes, live software suddenly appeared on a large scale, lasting about 40 minutes.
“第一节课还没下课，下一节课准备开始。
"The first class is not over yet. The next class is ready to begin.
这个时候大家争抢资源，出现了上课老师卡顿，想提前开课的老师进不去的情况。
This time we compete for resources, there are classes teacher Carton, want to start early teachers can not enter the situation.
”华英学校副校长刘树枨告诉《中国新闻周刊》，同一时间很多直播平台也出现了不同程度的问题。
Chinese School Vice-Chancellor Liu Shu-cheng told China News Weekly that many live broadcast platforms have also experienced problems of varying degrees at the same time.
当数以亿计的师生像洪水一样涌入直播平台，很容易就冲垮了大坝。
When hundreds of millions of teachers and students flood the live broadcast platform, it is easy to wash away the dam.
“疫情事态超出我们的想象，仅仅大年三十近3000家机构在后台注册，如果不是我们注册流程非常复杂，一天的注册量会在几万家。
"The epidemic is beyond our wildest imagination, with only about 3,000 organizations registered backstage in the New Year, with tens of thousands of registrations a day but for the complexity of our registration process.
”翼鸥教育在官方微信公号上详细讲述了这段特殊时期的经历。
The Flock Education detailed the experience of this particular period on the official microphone.
翼鸥教育是一家为教育机构提供在线教室服务的公司。
Flock Education is an online classroom service provider for educational institutions.
疫情期间，后台流量就开始暴增，最高时候一天之内登录的学生人次超过 160 万，同时在线的学生人数超过了 35 万，而在疫情到来之前，平台在最高峰的时候也不过是 3 万人。
Back-office traffic began to surge during the epidemic, with more than 1.6 million students logged on in a single day, more than 350,000 students online at the same time, and only 30,000 at its peak before the outbreak.
除了线下机构，许多公立学校也陆续找上门来，包括北大、北师大、中科大、人大附中、北京四中、101 中学等。
In addition to offline institutions, a number of public schools, including Peking University, Beijing Normal University, CUHK, affiliated to the People's Congress, Beijing IV Middle School, 101 Middle School, etc.
为此紧急应对这些客户，翼鸥教育想尽办法把系统扩容。
To deal with these customers urgently, Flock Education is trying its best to expand the system.
但由于扩容速度过快，系统稳定性急剧下降，“老用户骂我们贪财贪利签约太多，系统不太稳定，服务水平一落千丈。
But due to the rapid expansion speed, the system stability fell sharply, "the old users scold us greedy signing too much, the system is not stable, service standards plummeted.
”在线教育行业，中小机构多使用类似翼鸥教育提供的第三方在线教育或直播系统。
In the online education industry, small and medium-sized organisations use third-party online education or direct broadcasting systems similar to those offered by gull education.
突然暴涨的用户需求，让这些第三方系统难以招架。
These third-party systems are overwhelmed by sudden surges in user demand.
俞敏洪也曾表示：“要是新东方真的把100多万学员直接搬到第三方系统上，它们的系统也根本承载不了，因为它们还要承载外面很多机构的业务。
Miss Yu also said: "If New Oriental does move more than a million students directly to third-party systems, their systems simply cannot take on the business of many outside institutions.
这就等于我们所有学员在家里没有平台上课，新东方可能也就倒闭了。
This means that all our students have no platform to attend classes at home, and New Oriental may go out of business.
”钉钉怎么解决高达5000万的并发人次？方永新介绍，依托阿里云的全力支持，最初流量洪峰到来时，钉钉两个小时扩容了1万多台服务器。
Fang Yongxin said that with the full support of Ali cloud, more than 10,000 servers were nailed up for two hours when the initial flood peak hit.
在过去一段时间里，阿里云总共为钉钉扩容了10万台云服务器，“如果没有这些机器支持，能够同时满足1000万人上课就不错了。
Over the past period, Ali cloud has added 100,000 cloud servers to the nail clips. "It would have been nice to be able to accommodate 10 million classes at once without the support of these machines.
”“如果没有云计算的话，在线教育公司绝对承担不了爆发的业务量。
"Without cloud computing, online education companies would never be able to handle the volume of business that would have broken out.
”阿里云智能在线教育行业架构师江南告诉《中国新闻周刊》，他经常遇到的最紧迫情况是，有些客户要求一天之内就要准备好第二天的资源，还不只是单纯的扩容需求。
Jiang Nan, an online education industry architect for Ali cloud, told China News Weekly that the most pressing situation he often encountered was that some clients required resources for the next day in one day, not just for expansion.
当很多客户同时提出来的时候，也给阿里云带来很大压力。
When a lot of clients come up at the same time, it puts a lot of pressure on Mr. Ali.
从2月初到现在，钉钉每两三天经历一次产品迭代，从直播卡顿、连麦效果、语音质量上都在不断优化。
From the beginning of February to the present, nailing goes through product iterations every two or three days, from live Catton to wheat effect and voice quality.
方永新介绍：“一开始发现卡顿问题，以为是扩容不够，阿里云连续做了多次大规模扩容，但还是有用户反馈使用不畅。
Fang Yongxin said: "At first we found out Carton problem, thought that the expansion is not enough, Ali cloud has made a number of large-scale expansion, but user feedback is still poor.
后来，我们分析发现，80％~90％用户是差异化网络环境造成的，也有电脑、手机等硬件设备的问题。
Later, we found that 80% to 90% of the users are caused by the differentiated network environment, but also computer, mobile phone and other hardware equipment problems.
” 方永新举例说，语音通话的时候出现“抖音”问题，这可能是由于接听双方网络类型、网络带宽不同等原因造成，这些“物理原因”很难立刻就能优化好。
Mr Fang said, for example, that "voice chattering" problems occurred during voice calls, which could be due to differences in network types and bandwidth between the two sides, and that these "physical reasons" could not be optimized immediately.
不是每家机构都可以像钉钉一样获得这么大力度的支持。
Not every institution can get as much support as a nail.
“我们必须限流，才能保证系统的稳定”，翼鸥教育称：计划“建设全新的、超大规模通信网络，以容纳上千万的学生同时上课，但是这需要一段较长时间。
"We have to limit the flow to keep the system stable," says Flock Education. "The plan is to" build a whole new, very large-scale communications network to accommodate tens of millions of students simultaneously, but it will take a long time. "
”这些技术体验问题也引起了教育部的重视。
These technical experience problems have also attracted the attention of the Ministry of Education.
教育部相关负责人在接受采访时表示：确保网络正常运行是保障网上教学的基本前提。
In an interview, the head of the Ministry of Education said: to ensure the normal operation of the network is to guarantee the basic premise of online teaching.
由于我国中小学生人数众多，各地网络基础条件差异较大，在延期开学的同一时间段内集中上网学习，出现了网络拥堵。
Due to the large number of primary and secondary school students in China, the basic conditions of the network are different, in the same period of time to delay the start of school focused on online learning, there is a network congestion.
各地要加大与工信部门及网络运行企业的协调力度，积极争取支持。
All localities should strengthen coordination with industrial and communications departments and network operating enterprises and actively seek support.
要因地制宜、从实际出发，根据当地网络情况、服务能力、学生分布等做好分析研判，有针对性地指导“错峰”登录上网。
To adapt to local conditions, from the actual point of view, according to the local network, service capacity, student distribution and other good analysis and assessment, targeted guidance "staggered peak" login on the Internet.
全民网课模式下，一些新的问题浮出水面。
Some new problems have surfaced under the Universal Online Course mode.
据中国网消息，2月29日上午，河南邓州初三年级的14岁女孩李某敏因家中贫困，没有钱买手机按时跟听学校网课，大量吞服母亲治疗精神疾病的药物。
Li Min, a 14-year-old girl in the third year of Dengzhou Middle School in Henan province, had no money to buy a cell phone to attend school online classes on time and swallow a lot of medicine for her mother's mental illness, according to China Net.
报道称：“因受疫情影响，年后，李家姐弟三人只能在家上网课。
"The three Li brothers and sisters had to go online at home after three years because of the outbreak," the report said.
父亲李汉党虽然东挪西凑让邻居帮忙在网上买了一部智能手机，但因为只有一部手机，姐姐和弟弟也要用，李某敏能用的时间没多少，因此落下了许多功课，同时还要面对老师和同学们的质疑，一时想不开，选择吞食母亲的治疗药物。
While his father, Li Han, scraped together neighbors to help him buy a smartphone online, his sister and younger brother used it too. Li was left with little time to do so, and faced questions from his teachers and classmates about swallowing his mother's medication.
”不少农村和偏远山区的孩子，有可能因为家庭无力购买智能手机、平板电脑或手机流量，而被挡在“网络课堂”之外，造成特殊时期的失学困境。
Many children in rural and remote mountain areas are at risk of being kept out of online classrooms because their families cannot afford smartphones, tablets or mobile phone traffic, creating special periods of absenteeism.
腾讯《深网》在一篇题为《偏远山区里的网课：全家把流量省给孩子，有的边放羊边学习》的文章中报道：在一些没有网络覆盖的地区，“蹭网络”、找信号成了这个“超长寒假”不少农村和偏远山区孩子每天学习的“必修课”之一。
In an article entitled "Online lessons in remote mountain areas: Families save traffic for their children, some learn while herding," Tencent reported: "Running the Internet and getting signals has become one of the" compulsory courses "that many children in rural and remote mountain areas learn every day during the" ultra-long winter vacation. "
一些孩子为了找信号、蹭网络，甚至需要步行几百米甚至是几公里到村支部或者悬崖边上网课。
Some children even have to walk hundreds or even several kilometers to get to the village branches or cliff-side internet classes to find signs and rub the Internet.
如何避免学生因为贫困而被阻挡在网课之外，为在线教育行业和教育部门提出了新的课题。
How to avoid students from being blocked from online courses because of poverty, for online education industry and education sector proposed a new topic.
线下机构的生存危机1月20日，华英学校负责人李忠听到钟南山院士关于新冠肺炎“人传人”的表态后，立刻感受到了事情的严重性，经历过非典时期的他对于疫情特别敏感。
On January 20, 2007, Li Zhong, the head of the China-UK school, heard the announcement by academician Zhong Nan Shan on the human-to-human transmission of pneumonia.
华英学校是一家总部在天津的线下培训机构，成立超过三十年，学员超过两万人。
Huaying School is an offline training institution headquartered in Tianjin. It has been established for more than 30 years and has more than 20,000 students.
“我在微信群里说，培训机构很可能要停课，其他管理层不以为然，都觉得离天津还挺远。
"I said in the micro-letter group that the training institutions are likely to suspend classes, and other management was not impressed and felt quite far from Tianjin.
”李忠对2003年非典时期，很多培训机构面临的生死危机印象深刻，“好多培训机构因为退费而关门了”。
Mr Li was impressed by the life-and-death crisis facing many training institutions during the SARS period in 2003, when "many training institutions closed down because of refund fees."
李忠回忆，为了应对非典停课，他临时买了几台光盘刻录机，把老师的课程录播成光碟，发放给学员。
Li recalled that in response to the suspension of SARS classes, he bought several CD-ROMs to record teachers' lessons and distribute them to students.
刻录机昼夜不停运作，坏了一台立刻再去买一台，最后刻制了近15000张光盘。
The burner went round the clock, broke down one, bought another, and eventually carved nearly 15,000 CDs.
出乎李忠意料的是，绝大多数家长没有退费，而是转成华英夏季课学费，非典疫情结束后，华英的报名学生数量出现暴增。
Much to Li's surprise, the vast majority of parents did not refund fees, but into Chinese-English summer school fees, after the SARS epidemic ended, Huaying registered students surged.
2020年是华英学校加入精锐教育集团后，业绩对赌的最后一年。
The year 2020 marks the final year in which China-UK schools make bets after joining elite education groups.
因为新冠肺炎疫情，生存危机、业绩压力又一次摆在了李忠的面前。
Because of the outbreak of new crown pneumonia, survival crisis, performance pressure once again placed in front of Li Zhong.
“全国各地陆续要求线下教培机构停课，对于线下教培机构的负责人而言，是进一步的观望，还是积极行动起来，从线下转移到线上，这是一个抉择。
"There is a growing demand across the country for offline training institutions to suspend classes, and it is a choice for those in charge of offline training institutions to take a further look-and-see, or to move aggressively from offline to online.
”东方优播CEO朱宇说，一些线下机构担心，如果没有转移好，反而会引起学员的流失。
Zhu Yu, chief executive of Eastern YouTube, said some offline organisations were concerned that failing to relocate would cause the loss of students.
但是不转移的话，生源很快会被线上机构抢走，线下机构由于停课没有收入，短期内就会出现现金流断裂，公司倒闭。
But without transfer, students will soon be taken online institutions, offline institutions because of the suspension of income, short-term cash flow will break down, the company closed.
“不管怎样，转变总比坐以待毙要好，否则接近三十年的新东方，将会山崩地裂。
"Either way, change is better than waiting to die, or nearly three decades of New Oriental will fall apart.
”俞敏洪表示，这次疫情让上百万寒假班学生无法上课，如果这些课程全部停课退费，七八万老师及员工的生计立刻成问题，新东方只能关门大吉。
Ms Yu said the outbreak had left millions of students unable to attend classes during the winter months and that if all classes were suspended, the livelihoods of 780,000 teachers and staff would be in immediate question and New Oriental would have to close down.
相比于新东方这类头部培训机构来说，中小机构面临的挑战严峻得多。
The challenges for small and medium-sized organisations are much greater than for head-training institutions like New Oriental.
中国民办教育协会培训教育专业委员会自2月7日至14日，面向全国31个省区市的校外培训机构进行调研发现，超过90％的机构表示存在很大的影响，目前机构经营存在部分困难或严重困难。
A study conducted from 7 to 14 February by the Professional Training and Education Committee of the China Association of Private Education for out-of-school training institutions in 31 provinces and municipalities across the country found that more than 90 per cent of the institutions indicated a high level of influence and that there were some difficulties or serious difficulties in operating the institutions.
受冲击最大的线下培训学校，有49.42％的机构预计收入同比减少五成以上。
In the hardest-hit offline training schools, 49.42 per cent expected revenues to fall by more than 50 per cent year-on-year.
“目前营收几乎没有，但是工资还在发，房租也得交。
"There is little revenue at the moment, but salaries are still being paid and rents have to be paid.
说白了，一年赚的钱，基本上都赔进去了。
To put it bluntly, most of the money earned in a year is paid for.
现在唯一能做的就是扛，没有其他办法。
The only thing that can be done now is to carry it, there is no other way.
”河南郑州的京联数学校长冯浩杰告诉《中国新闻周刊》，如果疫情一直持续，校外培训旺季暑假招生受到影响的话，他的学校将面临巨大危机。
Feng Haojie, head of the Beijing Union Mathematics Department in Zhengzhou, Henan, told China News Weekly that his school would face a major crisis if the epidemic persisted and summer school admissions were affected during the off-campus training season.
但对线下培训机构来说，转型线上，面临的不只是成本问题。
But for offline training institutions, the transition line faces more than just cost.
雷雨资本专注教育领域风投，董事总经理朱国平告诉《中国新闻周刊》：“在线教育有其自身的业务特性和竞争挑战，不是简单的从线下转向线上，就可以获得红利，实际上是完全进入另一个竞争领域。
"Online education has its own business characteristics and competitive challenges, and instead of simply switching from offline to online, you can reap dividends," Zhu Guoping, managing director of Thunderstorm Capital, told China News Weekly.
相当一部分习惯于线下的机构是很难适应的，这也就带来了培训机构的洗牌格局。
A considerable number of institutions used to offline is difficult to adapt, which also brought about the training institutions shuffle pattern.
”事实上，即使是猿辅导这样从创立开始就立足在线教育的公司，在商业模式探索上也经历了一个持续的深耕过程。
Indeed, even companies such as Apes Tutoring, which has been based on online education since its inception, have gone through a sustained process of deep cultivation of their business models.
猿辅导联合创始人帅科对《中国新闻周刊》表示：“一开始，‘只要能为用户持续提供价值的产品就有生命力’的想法很坚定，在做的过程中，我们逐步对‘教育在线化’变得更坚定。
"At first, the idea of 'as long as products that provide continuing value to users are viable' was strong, and as we did so, we gradually became more committed to 'education online,'" Shark told China News Weekly.
”很多业内人士都预测，尽管面临生源的暴涨，但在线教育行业将加速洗牌。
Many in the industry predict that the online education industry will hasten the reshuffle in spite of surging student numbers.
疫情前十年，众多在线教育机构一直面临盈利难题。
In the decade before the epidemic, many online educational institutions faced a profit dilemma.
对于这次在线教育热，精锐教育创始人张熙公开表示，“一年内至少60％的在线教育公司会倒闭。
