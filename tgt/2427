”继前一天因“身体不适”取消了一场弥撒后，83岁的罗马天主教皇方济各在周五取消了更多活动。
Francis, the 83-year-old Roman Catholic emperor, cancelled more activities Friday after cancelling a mass the day before because he was "unwell."
据半岛电视台28日报道，梵蒂冈发表声明称，教皇正在居家工作，已取消推迟了他原计划出席的公开接见活动。
The Vatican issued a statement saying the pope was working from home and cancelled a public reception he had planned to attend, al-Jazeera reported Wednesday.
据界面新闻此前报道，前一日，教皇方济各因身体“有点不舒服”，取消了周四原本与罗马神职人员共同出席的弥撒。
The day before, Pope Francis had cancelled a mass he had attended with the Roman clergy because he was "a little sick," the Interface News reported earlier.
而在26日的“圣灰星期三”弥撒中，有照片显示教皇曾有咳嗽和擤鼻子的动作。
The pope coughed and blew his nose at the Ash Wednesday Mass on the 26th.
在当天早些时候的一场活动中，方济各还特意与前排的信徒们握了手，并在专车驶过圣彼得广场时亲吻了一名婴儿，还在最后向到访的主教们近距离致意。
At an event earlier in the day, Francis shook hands with the faithful in the front row and kissed a baby as he drove past St. Peter's Square, and at the end offered close greetings to visiting bishops.
然而，主教们似乎并没有像往常一样亲吻他的戒指或拥抱他。
However, the bishops did not seem to kiss his ring or hug him as usual.
由于梵蒂冈被意大利罗马环绕，而意大利又是欧洲新型冠状病毒引发肺炎疫情最严重的国家，因此教皇的“微恙”引发了一定的担忧。
The pope's "slight illness" raised some concerns as the Vatican was surrounded by Italy and Rome, the country with the worst case of pneumonia triggered by the new coronavirus in Europe.
不过，意大利的疫情主要集中在北部几个大区，而首都罗马位于中部。
However, the epidemic in Italy is concentrated in the northern regions, while the capital, Rome, is located in the centre.
截至目前，意大利共有655人病毒检测呈阳性，罗马确诊3个病例，现已痊愈出院。
So far, 655 persons have been tested positive for the virus in Italy, and three cases have been confirmed in Rome and have been discharged.
不过，梵蒂冈官员拒绝评论教皇是否接受了新冠病毒检测。
Vatican officials, however, declined to comment on whether the pope had been tested for the virus.
据了解，教皇在上世纪50年代时曾因肺结核切除了一边肺的一部分，但呼吸功能所受影响不大。
The pope was known to have excised part of one lung in the 1950s because of tuberculosis, but his respiratory function was not affected much.
目前除了腿部疼痛需定期治疗外，他的总体健康状况良好。
He is currently in good general health, with the exception of leg pain, which requires regular treatment.
据半岛电视台报道，梵蒂冈新闻室主任玛窦·布鲁尼在一份声明中说，教皇仍参加了晨间弥撒，在弥撒结束时也有向在场的人问好，但他已取消了自己的所有行程，仅将出席在自己居住的圣玛尔大之家（Saint Martha's）所举行的会议。
The pontiff still attended morning mass and said hello to those present at the end of the mass, but had cancelled all his trips and would only attend a meeting with Saint Martha and his family, Al Jazeera reported in a statement.
