Most of the workers in the production enterprises of Shanghai Tenor Biological Officer Net have already returned home for the holidays.
就算外面有支援调货过来，封城后也已经很难运送进来了。
Even if the outside support to transfer over, sealed after the city has been difficult to transport in.
很多人想当然地以为这是国家供应的，其实它是按照市场采购流程走的，厂商自己要想办法完成配送现在不仅仅参加一线救治的医护人员，各医院的全体医护人员都24小时待命。
Many people take it for granted that this is provided by the state, but in fact it follows the market procurement process. Manufacturers themselves have to find a way to deliver not only the first-line medical staff, but the entire hospital staff are on 24-hour standby.
除了身体上疲劳和高强度的心理压力，还面临医用物资短缺问题本文首发于南方人物周刊整理 | 徐梅 编辑|蒯乐昊全文约2160字，细读大约需要5分钟此刻的武汉面临以下问题：试剂盒数量不够、确诊艰难、床位短缺。
In addition to physical fatigue and high levels of psychological stress, there is a shortage of medical supplies. This article was first published in Quai Le Hao's full text of about 2,160 words. It takes about five minutes to read carefully. At this point in time, Wuhan faces the following problems: insufficient number of kits, difficulties in diagnosis, shortage of beds.
新型肺炎病毒试剂盒为什么供不应求？还在一线武汉紧急供货的试剂代理商为《南方人物周刊》发来口述：我是武汉一个微不足道的试剂代理商，跟医院和试剂盒厂商驻武汉代表都会打交道，试剂盒现在成了焦点，也有很多媒体报道关注，但是这不是一个简单的生产供货，也不是照相馆拍张照片立等可取，所有的厂商都是生物科技公司，他们的产品甚至需要专门的工程师，以及专门培训出来专门为医院服务的操作员。
I am a small reagent agent in Wuhan, dealing with representatives of hospitals and kit manufacturers in Wuhan. The kit is now the focus of much media attention, but it is not a simple production supply, nor is it a photo taken by the studio.
我们平常也需要跑医院，向医院推荐我们所代理的产品，并要为医院提供“试剂+仪器+服务”的一揽子服务。
We also need to run hospitals, recommend our products to hospitals, and provide a "reagent + instrument + service" package for hospitals.
我最早感到情况不好，是1月初的那次网传红头文件，那时还以为只是流感病毒很严重，要注意。
The first thing I felt bad about was the early January post, when I thought it was just the flu virus. Watch out.
听到有些做流感病毒相关检测的供应商说，甲乙流抗原检测产品用量激增，跟以往不一样的是，这次并不完全是因为流感，出现了某种不明原因的病毒，没有办法检测，只能采用排除法，把目前能检测的先排除掉。
Unlike in the past, when suppliers who heard about influenza-related tests said that the use of antigen detection products for influenza A / B had increased dramatically, this time it was not entirely due to the flu, there was some unknown virus, there was no way to detect it, and only the method of elimination was used to remove what was currently detectable.
没有任何人提及这个病毒是否有传染性，医院的医生也只是普通防护，可见当时这方面的信息并不多，我们对新型病毒都不了解。
No one mentioned whether the virus was contagious or not, and the hospital doctors were just plain old guard, so there wasn't much information about the virus and we didn't know about it.
没过两天，听说后湖有家医院感染科门诊已经穿上隔离防护服，这是我生平第一次听说某种疾病的诊断还需要这样戒备，立马感觉到很大的危险性。
Two days later, I heard that a hospital infection clinic in Houhu had put on protective clothing. This was the first time I had ever heard that a diagnosis of a disease required such vigilance.
接下来就听说不明原因的肺炎出现了，但很快又说目前没有人传人，大家也就嘻嘻哈哈没当回事。
Then came the news of unexplained pneumonia, but soon said that no one was passing from person to person, and everyone took it for granted.
1月14日晚上，一个同行问，哪里可以买到防护服，有医院要求检验人员全部穿防护隔离服，我才突然感觉到，事态发展得异乎寻常的快。
On the evening of 14 January, a colleague asked where protective clothing could be bought and the hospital asked the inspectors to wear protective clothing.
针对新型病毒的试剂盒，研发和取得注册证都需要时间，目前能生产的厂商有限正在这时候朋友圈里不断刷屏，检测新型肺炎的试剂盒出来了，已经有六个厂家可以生产，当时我们觉得非常高兴，因为之前医院都是把可能引起发烧发热的已知病毒查一遍，进行排查，北京来的呼吸专家团队做了必查项目预案，把其中八种病毒列为必查，如果不属于这些原因引起发热情况严重的，就由医院上报，送往金银潭医疗救治中心。
At a time when only a limited number of manufacturers are now able to clean up their screens and test kits for the new pneumonia, we were very pleased that eight of these viruses had previously been checked and cleared by a team of breathing experts from Beijing. If not, they were reported to the gold and silver pool medical treatment centre.
排查法耗时耗力，各医院检验人员也是超负荷运转。
Screening is time-consuming and labour-intensive, and hospital inspectors are overloaded.
现在直接用新的试剂就可以快速确诊了，大家还都挺高兴的。
Now the diagnosis can be made directly with a new reagent, and everyone is happy.
然而，现实很快给人们泼了一盆凉水，试剂没有注册证，按规定不能使用，就算知道可以确诊，一旦有什么问题谁来承担责任呢？当时只有金银潭救治中心是政府采购，可以使用，病人都要到那里检查确诊。
However, the reality quickly splashed a pot of cold water, reagents do not have registration certificates, the regulations can not be used, even if know can be diagnosed, who will be responsible for any problems? At that time, only gold and silver pool treatment centers are government procurement, can be used, patients have to go there to examine the diagnosis.
这个过程中我们都记得，有一天报道说已经连续一周没有新发现的病例，再过一天就可以宣布这个不明原因的肺炎已经得到有效控制了。
In the process, we all remember one day reporting no new cases for a week and another day announcing that the unidentified pneumonia had been brought under effective control.
这整个过程中绝大多数人是无感的，武汉正是各单位年终吃年饭的时候，各酒店异常火爆，完全不知道身边潜伏有这样大的危机。
The vast majority of people throughout the process is senseless, Wuhan is the end of the year to eat rice, hotels are extremely hot, completely unaware of the potential around such a big crisis.
直到1月19号下午，钟南山院士带领的高级别专家团对来武汉考察完毕，发出了预警，各医院紧急开会，我们顿时觉得气氛变了，确定人传人，从那天起我每天出门都会戴好口罩。
Until the afternoon of January 19, a high-level panel of experts led by academician Zhong Nan Shan came to Wuhan, issued an early warning, the hospital emergency meeting, we immediately felt the atmosphere changed, confirmed the person-to-person, from that day every day I will wear a mask.
假期厂家备货不足，物流目前难以进武汉1月20日政府紧急通知有三个厂家的新试剂盒（上海辉睿生物、上海捷诺生物、上海伯杰公司）允许使用了，某医院2000人份的试剂用完后发现阳性比例很高，他们担心试剂的可靠性，又通知江苏硕世生物过去做标本比对，最后这家企业的产品也说可以采购了。
Wuhan Jan 20, 2007 The government emergency notified three manufacturers of the use of new kits (Shanghai Pfizer, Shanghai Teno Biology, Shanghai Berger), a hospital after the use of the reagent found a high percentage of the reagent, they worried about the reliability of reagents, and informed Jiangsu Masters past sample comparison, the enterprise's products can also be purchased.
1月22日就放开了使用限制，只要有货可以自行采购。
On 22 January, restrictions on use were lifted, as long as goods were available for self-procurement.
然而这时候，很多人已经放假回家，厂家备货也不够充足，再加上这个检测需要特定设施，不是每个医院可以开展的。
By this time, however, many people have returned home, manufacturers do not have enough supplies, and this test requires specific facilities, not every hospital can carry out.
截至23日武汉围城，就算外面有支援调货过来，已经很难运送进来了。
As of the 23 th Wuhan siege, even if there is support from outside the transfer of goods, has been difficult to transport in.
很多人想当然地以为这是国家供应的，其实它是按照市场采购流程走的，厂商自己要想办法完成配送。
Many people take it for granted that this is provided by the state, but in fact it follows the market procurement process, the manufacturer must find a way to complete the distribution.
现在朋友圈里盛传，试剂盒供不应求，武汉新型冠状病毒肺炎确诊之难的文章，大家对医院批评很多，但医院自身并没有自主权，现在各级问责，不按规定使用医用物资是要严重处罚的。
There is a lot of criticism about the hospital, but the hospital itself has no autonomy. Now there is accountability at all levels. Failure to use medical supplies as prescribed is a serious punishment.
没有注册证的试剂医院擅自使用本来受严厉管控，没有政府指示肯定是不敢使用的。
The unauthorized use of reagent hospitals without registration certificates was strictly controlled and was certainly not used without government instructions.
江苏硕世生物试剂试剂盒使用方法很专业，使用不当很易引起交叉感染试剂使用需要专业的仪器和实验室，有能力做的医院，他们的PCR仪器同时还要做很多其他项目，这个感染性诊断试剂盒如果和其它项目一起做会有交叉感染的风险。
Jiangsu Masters biological reagent kit use method is very professional, improper use of cross-infection reagents easy to cause the use of professional instruments and laboratories, capable of hospitals, their PCR instruments also do a lot of other items, this infectious diagnostic kit and other items will be at risk of cross-infection.
必须只做这一个项目才能保证检测结果可靠、检测人员安全。
Only this project can guarantee the reliability of the test results and the safety of the tester.
大疫当前，现在每个实验室都是24小时连轴转，患有其他疾病的病人，医院也有责任收治诊疗的，所以这就给检测带来了很大的难度。
The current pandemic, each laboratory is now a 24-hour rotation, other diseases of patients, the hospital is also responsible for treatment, so that the detection of a very difficult.
我作为一个一线的试剂供应商，所看到的就是这些，因为工作的原因，接触到一线的情况也比较多，我把我看见的说出来，是想让更多焦急的武汉人也知道医院内部是怎么在加速应对突发的紧急状况的。
As a front-line reagent supplier, this is what I see, because of the work, access to the front line is more, I said I saw, so that more anxious Wuhan people also know how the hospital is accelerating the response to sudden emergencies.
我们这行平常也不怎么受人待见，媒体提起来好像是我们造成了医药费高。
We're not usually very popular in our profession, and the media mention us as contributing to the high cost of medicine.
但说实话，每个人都是这个社会的一粒尘埃。
But to be honest, everyone is a speck of dust in this society.
这两天我看到厂商代表坚守在武汉，想各种办法给有需要的医院紧急送货，这个时候冒着被感染的危险这么做，不可能只是为了钱！我这两天还在跑医院，现在不仅仅参加一线救治的医护人员，各医院的全体医护人员都24小时待命。
Over the past two days, I have seen the representatives of manufacturers sticking to Wuhan, trying to make urgent delivery to hospitals in need, doing so at the risk of infection, not just for money!
除了身体上疲劳和高强度的心理压力，还面临医用物资短缺问题，医护人员还托我们帮忙买防护服、口罩，都是自己花钱。
In addition to physical fatigue and high levels of psychological stress, but also facing shortages of medical supplies, medical staff also entrusted us to help buy protective clothing, masks, are their own money.
同在危城，不要动不动就开口喷这个喷那个，大家有能力都出点儿力吧！。
At the same time in the city, do not always open mouth spray that, we have the ability to do something about it!
