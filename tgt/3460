危机很有可能才刚刚开始中国之外，疫情来得相当猛烈。
The crisis is likely to be just beginning outside China, and the epidemic is quite severe.
首当其冲的是欧洲。
The first is Europe.
在意大利，确诊人数已经达到一万七千余人，死亡数和治愈数比例更是趋近1:1。
In Italy, more than 17,000 people have been diagnosed, and the ratio of deaths to deaths is closer to 1: 1.
而排名第二的西班牙，截至当地时间14日12时，累计确诊数5753人，死亡人数136人。
Spain, in second place, had a cumulative total of 5,753 confirmed cases and 136 deaths by 12: 00 local time on the 14th.
当地时间3月13日下午，西班牙首相桑切斯终于宣布进入紧急状态，期限15天，以遏制冠状病毒病的蔓延。
On the afternoon of March 13, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Antonio Sánchez finally declared a state of emergency for 15 days to stop the spread of coronavirus.
而根据路透社最新消息，西班牙或将追随意大利的脚步，开始“封国”：一份法令草案显示，该国政府将宣布，除购买食品或药品、住院、上班或其他紧急情况外，所有西班牙人必须待在家中。
According to the latest Reuters news agency report, Spain may follow Italy's lead and start "sealing the country": a draft decree says the government will announce that all Spaniards will have to stay at home, except for food or medicine, hospitalization, work or other emergencies.
与紧迫的疫情相对的是，当地人的神经却并未开始紧绷，依然根据日常的习惯来生活。
In contrast to the urgency of the outbreak, the nerves of the locals have not begun to tighten and continue to live according to their daily habits.
危机很有可能才刚刚开始。
The crisis is most likely just beginning.
犹豫不决西班牙华人王琪告诉中国慈善家，尽管一连串禁令到来，但当地人似乎仍不以为意。
Undecided Spanish philanthropist Wang Qi tells Chinese philanthropists that despite a series of bans, locals still seem to be taking offense.
王琪在马德里一家整形医院做顾问。
Wang Qi worked as a consultant at a plastic hospital in Madrid.
整容医院也有开设牙科。
Dental services are also available at cosmetic hospitals.
这个手术过程中会产生大量飞沫、在国内至今未复工的工种，在马德里却直到3月13日紧急状态禁令下达前仍在照常营业。
The operation, which produces droplets and jobs that have not returned to work in the country, remained open in Madrid until March 13, when the state of emergency was imposed.
“完全不敢往（牙科）那边去走动。
"I dare not walk up and down (the dental unit).
”王琪说。
"said Wang Qi.
同事们的态度也让她担忧。
The attitude of her colleagues worried her, too.
根据王琪形容，尽管相对普通人，医院工作人员的防护意识已经好了很多，知道要戴口罩。
According to Wang Qi, despite the relative ordinary people, hospital staff have a much better sense of protection, know to wear a mask.
但他们戴口罩的方法依旧同国人不一样：只遮住嘴，不挡住鼻子，而且聊天的时候都会将口罩取下。
But the way they wear masks is not the same as in China: they cover their mouths, not their noses, and they remove their masks when they talk.
“其实就没什么意义”。
"It just doesn't make sense.
外出的人数并不见少，也几乎都不戴口罩，甚至不少夜店、餐馆仍在照常营业。
Out of the number of people are not small, almost all do not wear masks, even many nightclubs, restaurants are still business as usual.
相对的是华人店家，80%都关了店。
By contrast, 80 per cent of Chinese stores are closed.
当地华人自发在地铁口发放口罩给过往行人。
Local Chinese gave out masks to passers-by at the subway entrance.
王琪还注意到，西班牙各个超市中，最先被清扫一空的是卫生纸和消毒酒精，而非口罩。
Wang also noticed that toilet paper and disinfectant alcohol, rather than masks, were the first to be cleaned out in Spanish supermarkets.
关于为什么要抢卫生纸，王琪提出的一种解释是：当地人以为制造卫生纸使用的原料和口罩相同，而随着疫情发展，厂家们都会转产口罩，如果现在不多买一点，很快就会没有纸用了。
One explanation for the scramble for toilet paper: locals think they use the same ingredients as masks when it comes to making toilet paper, and as the epidemic progresses, manufacturers switch to masks and quickly run out of paper if they don't buy more.
马德里当地药房，消毒酒精已经被抢购一空。
Disinfectant alcohol has been snapped up at local pharmacies in Madrid.
图/受访者供图更令王琪无言的是，原本在她的概念中，学校停学，就代表着家长应该带着孩子宅家隔离。
To add to Wang Qi's silence, the original concept of school suspension meant that parents should be separated from their children's homes.
但街上带孩子的家长们却明显多了起来——原来在当地人眼中，不上学，就代表着可以出来玩了。
But there has been a marked increase in the number of parents with children on the street - who, in the eyes of the locals, do not go to school, which means they can come out and play.
王琪也不是没有试图扭转过同事们的观念。
Wang Qi is not not trying to reverse the ideas of colleagues.
她试图说服老板放假，但却被当场拒绝，老板的说辞总是“马德里现在才一千多例，不会有事的”。
She tried to persuade her boss to have a holiday, but she was turned down on the spot. The boss always said, "Madrid is just over a thousand cases now, it's all right."
“万一传染上了呢？”“凡事都有可能。
What if it should infect himEverything is possible.
每年出车祸的人比这多多了，没什么好怕的。
There are more people in car accidents every year than this. There is nothing to fear.
”这只是“大号流感”、只针对有基础疾病的老年人、凡事都有可能、没必要害怕——绝大多数西班牙人中，仍流行着这些观念。
"This is just a" big flu "for the elderly with underlying illnesses, something that is possible and needless to fear - ideas that still prevail in most Spaniards.
新冠病毒在西班牙的流行，和意大利亦不无关系。
The spread of the new crown virus in Spain is not unrelated to Italy.
前不久，上千名西班牙瓦伦西亚球迷随队远征圣西罗球场，前往观看客战亚特兰大的球赛。
Not long ago, thousands of Spanish Valencia fans traveled to San Siro to watch the game in Atlanta.
而在回到西班牙后。
After returning to Spain.
一名瓦伦西亚跟队记者就被确诊感染了新冠病毒。
A Valencia-based team reporter has been diagnosed with the new crown virus.
而其余人并未做有效隔离，从意大利回来后就各自分散回了家。
The rest did not segregate effectively and returned home from Italy.
面对此情此景，王琪不是没有想过回国“避难”。
Faced with this situation, Wang Qi did not want to return to the "asylum."
但却阻碍重重：单程机票价格已经涨到了1400欧元，折合人民币超过万元。
But there are obstacles: one-way ticket prices have risen to 1,400 euros, equivalent to more than 10,000 yuan.
其次，飞机上的感染风险也不容小觑。
Second, the risk of infection on an airplane should not be underestimated.
直接的金钱支出只能算是小成本，真正让王琪犹豫不定的，是一系列的工作和签证风险。
Direct money expenditure can only be regarded as a small cost, let Wang Qi really hesitant, is a series of work and visa risks.
她试图向老板申请假期，但却被后者拒绝，贸然回国就等于自动辞职。
She tried to apply for a holiday from her boss, but the latter refused, and a precipitate return would be tantamount to automatic resignation.
而且她的签证中规定，倘若回国超过三个月，签证便会作废，无法续签。
Moreover, her visa stipulated that if she returned for more than three months, the visa would be cancelled and could not be renewed.
“万一西班牙也如意大利一般封国，就麻烦了。
"If Spain were to seal like Italy, it would be in trouble.
就这个趋势，三个月可能压不住。
Three months may not hold up on this trend.
”王琪说。
"said Wang Qi.
思前想后，王琪还是决定不回国。
After thinking about it, Wang Qi decided not to return home.
对于王琪而言，贸然回国，要放弃的东西实在太多了：工作、签证、绿卡，猫。
For Wang Qi, rushed home, to give up too much things: work, visas, green cards, cats.
来之不易的稳定生活，都在这一次疫情中开始摇摇欲坠。
The hard-won stability of life, in this case began to crumble.
截至发稿，西班牙方面传来消息，随着禁令的日趋收紧，西班牙已经强制商家关门，允许营业的只有药房和超市。
At the time of writing, news had reached Spain that, as the ban tightened, Spain had forced businesses to close and only pharmacies and supermarkets were allowed to operate.
王琪所在的医院已经被关停。
Wang Qi's hospital has been closed.
而据传，马德里的“封城”也即将开始。
According to legend, Madrid's "closure" is about to begin.
紧急状态第一天的超市货架，几乎所有食物均被抢购一空。
On the first day of the emergency, supermarket shelves, almost all the food was snapped up.
图/受访者供图回国者除了仍在犹豫的人，也有人当机立断做了回国的决定。
Photo / interviewees show that besides those who are still hesitating, some people have made a decision to go home at once.
3月4日，马德里侨商徐娇当机立断订了次日的机票，带着孩子回了国，留下丈夫经营店铺。
March 4, Madrid overseas business Xu Jiao immediately booked the next day's air tickets, with the children back to the country, leaving her husband to run the store.
原本徐娇在每年三月底都有回国的计划，为的是清明返乡祭祖。
Originally Xu Jiao had plans to return home at the end of March every year in order to clear the ancestors of the returning home.
但疫情很快有了扩散态势。
But the epidemic quickly spread.
三月初，西班牙的确诊病例已经超过百人，但官方还未宣布暂缓法雅节和半程马拉松赛事的举行。
In early March, more than 100 cases were confirmed in Spain, but officials have yet to announce a moratorium on the festival and the half-marathon.
见势不妙，徐娇立刻将回国的计划提了前。
Not good enough, Xu Jiao immediately put the plan to return to the country before.
回国的主要原因是为了孩子的健康考虑。
The main reason for returning home is for the health of the children.
3月初，西班牙的学校依旧照常上课，且不允许请假。
At the beginning of March, Spanish schools continued to operate as usual and were not allowed to take leave.
当地学校的规定是，倘若没有病假条或者医生证明，超过三天不去学校，就会将孩子从学校除名。
Local schools require that children be removed from school if they fail to attend school for more than three days without a medical certificate or certificate.
但跟随父母回国则不受此限制。
However, following parents home is not subject to this restriction.
机票也不好买。
Tickets are not easy to buy.
原本从马德里回国，一天有五趟直飞航班，如今锐减到只有两趟，且3月20日之前的机票都已经售磬。
The number of non-stop flights from Madrid, which used to run five times a day, has plummeted to just two, with tickets sold out before March 20.
为此，徐娇一家人只好绕道法兰克福转机回国。
For this reason, Xu Jiao family had to detour via Frankfurt to return home.
两趟转机之间的区别相当明显：马德里到法兰克福这一班飞机上，中国人全都戴上了口罩，徐娇还专门给孩子准备了防护服。
The difference between the two flights is obvious: on the plane from Madrid to Frankfurt, the Chinese all wore masks and Xu Jiao prepared special protective clothing for the children.
但欧洲当地人则鲜有防范意识。
But locals in Europe have little sense of precaution.
而从法兰克福回北京，国人骤然变多，全都戴上了口罩。
And from Frankfurt back to Beijing, people suddenly changed more, all wearing masks.
到了北京后，徐娇感受到，中国的防疫力度“明显比欧洲高几个级别”。
After arriving in Beijing, Xu felt that China's epidemic prevention efforts were "significantly higher than Europe's several levels."
申报、登记、分批离开，一切进行得有条不紊。
Declaration, registration, partial departure, everything is in order.
从北京到温州后，上述流程又走了一遍。
From Beijing to Wenzhou, the above-mentioned process once again.
乘客们接受完检疫，再由防疫站负责包车，分批接回青田县。
Passengers after the quarantine, and then by the anti-epidemic station responsible for charter, batch back to Qingtian County.
某种程度来说，时至今日，疫情最初的战场——湖北武汉，情况已经基本得到控制，工作重心已经从内部暴发转向了防止境外输入。
To some extent, by now, the situation in Wuhan, Hubei province, the initial battleground of the epidemic, has largely been brought under control, with the focus shifting from internal to external.
而各个侨乡成了病毒防控的桥头堡。
And each diaspora has become the bridgehead of the virus control.
徐娇的老家，浙江丽水青田县就是众多“桥头堡”之一。
Xu Jiao's hometown, Zhejiang Lishui Qingtian county is one of many "bridgehead fort".
根据央视新闻报道，青田县共有33万人侨居海外，其中有10万青田人在意大利生活工作。
According to CCTV news reports, 330,000 people live overseas in Qingtian, of whom 100,000 live and work in Italy.
随着欧洲疫情日趋严重，归国侨胞不断增多。
As the European epidemic gets worse, the number of returnees continues to rise.
为防止境外输入病例，青田县出台了各项防控措施。
To prevent the importation of cases from abroad, Qingtian County has introduced various prevention and control measures.
其中就包括防疫站包车接送，落地不回家，直接送酒店隔离十四天的“闭环”制度。
This includes the "closed-loop" system that allows passengers to be transported to and from a quarantine station without landing at home for 14 days.
徐娇一下飞机，就被送进了政府临时租用的酒店，十四天内不允许出房间门。
As soon as Xu Jiao got off the plane, he was sent to a hotel temporarily rented by the government.
据说，这家酒店2月26日重新开业，结果3月5日就被政府租用了。
The hotel reportedly reopened on 26 February and was rented by the Government on 5 March.
随着归国人员日趋增多，青田当地的酒店也很快告急。
With the increasing number of returnees, the local hotel in Qingtian is fast running out of steam.
“几天时间，酒店都住满了，听说接下来的几批可能会安排到别的地方去。
"For a few days, the hotel was full and I heard that the next batch might be arranged somewhere else.
”徐娇说。
"said Xu Jiao.
目前，徐娇和孩子已经在酒店房间里住了十天，每天有人消毒，一日三餐有人送。
So far, Xu Jiao and his children have been staying in the hotel room for 10 days, disinfecting people every day and sending them three meals a day.
目前总体来说一切满意。
So far it has been generally satisfactory.
只是因为担心交叉感染的缘故，房间内的中央空调无法使用。
The central air conditioner in the room is not available simply because of concerns about cross-infection.
截至发稿，徐娇家的店已经被关停。
As of the date of dispatch, Xu Jiaomei's shop has been closed.
中间商海外快速扩张的疫情，也让不少人从中嗅到了商机。
The rapid expansion of middlemen abroad has also made many people sniff out business opportunities.
前些日子，为了满足防疫需求，不少被服、医疗器械甚至汽车生产厂家纷纷转产口罩，但随着疫情逐渐好转，口罩的需求逐渐缩水，价格也开始缓慢下降。
Some days ago, many clothing, medical equipment and even auto makers switched to masks to meet epidemic prevention needs, but as the epidemic gradually improved, demand for masks gradually dwindled and prices began to decline slowly.
“人们也不强求N95了，经常一个一次性口罩用几天。
"People don't force N95 anymore and often use a disposable mask for a few days.
”口罩经销商大军告诉中国慈善家。
The army of mask dealers told Chinese philanthropists.
但在马德里，需求似乎才刚刚开始增长。
But in Madrid, demand seems to be just beginning to grow.
大军在西班牙的朋友告知他，一盒50只装的一次性医用口罩，在当地能卖到近50欧元，折合下来，每只将近8元人民币。
A friend of the army in Spain told him that a 50-pack of disposable medical masks would sell locally for nearly 50 euros, or nearly 8 yuan each.
而在国内，单只一次性医用口罩的出厂成本最高也不过2元人民币。
At home, the cost of a single disposable medical mask can be as low as RMB 2.
其中利润相当可观。
The profits are considerable.
如图一盒50只装的口罩，售价47.5欧元。
Here's a 50-pack mask for 47.50 euros.
图/受访者供图尽管就目前来说，欧洲口罩的客户群依然以华人为主。
Chart / Interviewee Chart Although for the time being, the majority of clients of masks in Europe are Chinese.
在马德里当地人的观念中，口罩是“有病的人才戴的”，健康人则不需要。
In Madrid, masks are seen as "worn by sick people" and not by healthy people.
但大军有自己的一套理论，依然囤积了一批口罩，准备和朋友一起“赌一把”。
But the army has its own theory, still hoarding a number of masks, ready to "gamble" with friends.
“人都是一样的，都怕死。
"All men are alike; they fear death.
真到了玩命的时候，什么习惯都得改。
When it comes to life, every habit has to be changed.
”大军说。
"said the grand army.
早先，大军还有所担心，向海外出售口罩是否会触犯法律，有“倒卖国家战略物资”的嫌疑。
Earlier, the army also had concerns about whether selling masks overseas would violate the law, suspected of "reselling national strategic goods."
但这种忧虑很快就被打消了。
But that concern was quickly dispelled.
3月5日的商务部新闻发布会上，商务部外贸司司长李兴乾澄清称，口罩属于自由贸易产品，中国政府未设置任何贸易管制措施，疫情发生以来，商务部也从未发布过有关口罩及其生产原材料出口的禁令。
At a press conference on March 5, Li Xingqian, director of the Ministry of Commerce's foreign trade department, clarified that the masks were free-trade products, that the Chinese government had not imposed any trade controls and that the Ministry of Commerce had never issued a ban on the export of masks and their raw materials since the outbreak.
不过，没有出口禁令，也不代表口罩生意就能进行得一帆风顺。
However, the absence of an export ban does not mean that the mask business can proceed smoothly.
根据公众号“中国国际商会”的解释，2019年起，欧盟新法规PPE Regulation (EU) 2016/425强制执行，要求所有出口欧盟的口罩，必须在新法规的要求下获得CE认证证书。
According to the public name "China International Chamber of Commerce," the new EU regulation PPE Regulation (EU) 2016 / 425 has been enforced since 2019, requiring all EU respirators exported from the European Union to obtain a CE certification certificate as required by the new regulation.
CE认证是欧盟实行的强制性产品安全认证制度，目的是为了保障欧盟国家人民的生命财产安全。
CE certification is a mandatory product safety certification system implemented by the European Union in order to ensure the safety of people's lives and property in EU countries.
而大军购买的口罩都是临时转产的工业防护用品，没有达到医用级别，获取CE认证更是遥遥无期。
But the army buys the mask is the temporary conversion industrial protection supplies, has not reached the medical grade, obtains CE certification is far away.
也就是说，大军的货即便运到西班牙，也没办法堂而皇之地在药房售卖，只能在当地华人微商圈子中小规模流转。
In other words, even if the goods of the army to Spain, can not be sold in pharmacies, can only be small-scale circulation in the local Chinese micro-business community.
倘若一次性运量太大，还有被查扣的风险。
If the volume of one-time traffic is too large, there is also the risk of seizure.
为此，大军只好使用“最笨”的办法：利用跨国快递，以每包一百个的自用量将口罩发到欧洲。
To that end, the army has resorted to the "stupidest" approach: using international couriers to deliver masks to Europe at the rate of 100 per pack.
但这样一来，不仅运费居高不下，发货量也不稳定。
But not only are freight rates high, but shipments are also volatile.
这些日子，大军能够感觉到，朋友似乎有些不满，想要另寻量更大、更稳定、有资质的供货商。
These days, the army can sense that friends seem dissatisfied and want to look for larger, more stable, qualified suppliers.
甚至绕开他直接对接口罩厂家。
He even docked directly to the mask manufacturer.
“前段时间有客户，找不到产口罩的地方。
"I had clients a while ago and I couldn't find a place to produce masks.
现在反过来了，有口罩，找不到客户。
Now the other way around, I can't find a client with a mask.
”面对朋友的“意图背叛”，大军显得有些无奈。
"Faced with the" intention of betrayal "of friends, the army appears to be somewhat helpless.
“没办法，谁让我不懂英语，也不认识那边的人呢？”在接受采访的时候，大军还问记者“认不认识欧洲那边的朋友”，希望能帮着推荐几个客户。
"There is no way, who let me do not know English, do not know the people there?" In the interview, the army also asked reporters "do not know the European side of friends," hoping to help recommend a few customers.
