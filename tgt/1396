【1】 杨晓波：长江梦碎1月25日，正值大年初一，杨晓波因感染肺炎住进了湖北省人民医院。
YangXiaobo: The Changjiang River Dreams On January 25, the first day of the Lunar New Year, Yang Xiaobo was admitted to the People's Hospital of Hubei Province with pneumonia.
病毒不挑身份，57岁的杨晓波是一家保险公司的董事长，已经掌舵长江财险六年。
The virus doesn't bother to identify itself. Yang Xiaobo, 57, chairman of an insurance company, has been steering the Yangtze River for six years.
和这个头衔相比，他作为黄石市原市长的旧职，更广为人知。
Compared to this title, his former position as mayor of Yellowstone is more widely known.
40岁担任中南建筑设计院院长，位居正厅级干部，44岁跨界出任湖北省建设厅厅长、党组书记，那时的杨晓波前途无量。

In the winter of 2008, 45-year-old Yang Xiaobo was transferred to deputy secretary of Huang Shi.
一位熟悉杨晓波的人士在杨晓波去世的文章下留言，评价其低调踏实，在黄石专心改变城市形象，思维超前，“多年后黄石人才逐步认识到他对黄石发展贡献不可替代”。
A person familiar with Yang Xiaobo left a message in Yang Xiaobo's death, commenting that it was low-key and down-to-earth. In Huang Shi's mind, he changed the image of the city and thought ahead.
“他太想在黄石干一番事业，每天只睡四五个小时甚至二三个小时，每天连轴转，特别劳累。

连年高强度的工作，为杨晓波的健康埋下了隐患。
Years of intensive work for Yang Xiaobo's health laid a hidden danger.
2014年，同样是冬天，杨晓波选择回到了武汉，出任长江财险董事长。
In 2014, also in the winter, Yang chose to return to Wuhan as chairman of the Yangtze River Financial Insurance Company.
今年元旦，杨晓波在新年致辞中表示，新的一年要“恢复增长、大幅减亏、推动高质量发展，不驰于空想、不骛于虚声”，号召员工“不忘初心再出发”。
In his New Year's Day address, Yang said the new year should "restore growth, significantly reduce losses and promote high-quality development, be less idealistic and less open-minded" and call on employees to "remember the beginning before departure.

长江是他救人的“主场”，哪里的堤岸坡度超过30度，哪里的青苔最厚最滑，哪里的台阶下面被江水掏空，他都知道。
The Yangtze River was his "home" for saving lives. He knew where the embankment slope exceeded 30 degrees, where moss was thickest and slippery, and where the river emptied under the stairs.
他还把黄鹤楼码头回流50米的“三角区”，称为武汉水域最危险的地方，2014年，他和同伴在这里救了24条生命。
He also brought back 50 meters of the Yellow Crane Tower Wharf to the "triangle," the most dangerous part of Wuhan's waters, where he and his companions saved 24 lives in 2014.

To ease the pain, Yu climbed more than 7,000 meters above sea level over the course of a few years while swimming in winter.
2010年登完珠峰后，解开心结的俞关荣意识到自己还有很多事要做。

Two days before his death, Yu Guanrong had told his wife Wang Tianrong on the telephone to take good care of himself and remember to sprinkle his ashes in the river outside the temple.
那里位于汉江与长江交汇处，生前他常常在这里游泳，也在这里挽救了很多生命。
It was at the confluence of the Han and Yangtze rivers, where he used to swim and saved many lives.
俞关荣走后，老伴王天蓉很伤感：“他救了一辈子人，最后自己需要人救的时候，连亲人都没有办法。
