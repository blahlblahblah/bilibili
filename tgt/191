我想让大家看到，武汉到底发生了什么 | 武汉一线摄影师专访。
I want you to see what AT & # 45; Wuhan has & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; Wuhan.
轮到你了。
It's your turn.
轮到你了                      。
It's your turn.
轮到你了。
It's your turn.
这是来自世界各地100多所高校大学生的新媒体实验室。
It is a new media laboratory for college students from more than 100 universities around the world.
在这里，遇见最有个性的大学生摄影师。
Here, meet the most individualistic college photographer.
。
.
这里是大学生的新媒体实验室 ∆轮到你了：这是武汉长江日报摄影记者陈卓参与武汉疫情报道的第16天，调岗一年后他被临时抽调参与一线报道。
Here is the new media laboratory for university students. This is the sixteenth day that Wuhan Changjiang Daily photographer, Chen Zhuo, will participate in Wuhan reporting of the epidemic.
武汉封城前一天，他安顿好家中老小，封城当天和妻子一起返回武汉，开始过这个充满未知与风险的，前所未有的春节。
Wuhan, the day before the closure of his home, he settled down with his wife and returned to Wuhan on the same day, began this full of unknown and risky, unprecedented Spring Festival.
Play追灵车的女孩……（文中所有视频、图片均为陈卓拍摄）女孩儿在哭喊，我在流泪轮：昨晚上看到朋友圈发的短视频，一个女孩子哭喊追着救护车，里面有她的母亲。
The girl was crying and I was crying: I saw a short video from a circle of friends last night, a girl crying for an ambulance with her mother inside.
这是你拍的？陈卓：是的，这是在湖北省中西医结合医院，也就是新华医院的急诊室外面拍的。
Chen Zhuo: Yes, it was taken outside the emergency room of Xinhua Hospital, the combination of Chinese and Western medicine in Hubei Province.
她母亲感染了新型冠状病毒性肺炎，发病四五天，在急诊室没抢救过来去世了。
Her mother contracted a new coronavirus pneumonia, four or five days after she died in the emergency room.
作为一个职业新闻记者，我们很回避去拍遗体，所以我没拿相机拍。
As a professional journalist, we avoided photographing the body, so I didn't take the camera.
但我看着那个女孩儿追着灵车，一直哭着喊着妈妈，我用手机录了一段小视频。
But I watched the girl chase the hearse and kept crying for my mother. I recorded a short video on my cell phone.
这些天来，看到很多这种情况，录下这一段，也是一种情绪的表达吧。
These days, seeing so many of these things, recording this paragraph is also an expression of emotion.
采访这么多天，见了太多病人的死亡，和亲属之间的这种离别，心里头非常非常的沉重。
The interview so many days, saw too many patients died, and between the relatives of this separation, the head is very, very heavy.
那个女孩儿在哭，我在拍的时候也一直在流泪，那段视频你可以看得出来拍得很晃，我真的也很不忍心。
The girl was crying, and I was crying all the time, and you can see the video, and I really can't bear it.
但是我还是想让我的朋友圈的人能够看到：武汉，到底发生了什么事情？封城当天，赶回武汉轮：今天是你开始这次疫情报道的第几天？这几天的日常报道通常是怎样安排的？每天都在医院跑吗，还是根据报社的任务根据不同主题去完成配图任务，或是做独立摄影报道？陈卓：2019年年初的时候我就已经不在采编岗位了。
But I still want my circle of friends to see: What happened in Wuhan? On the day of the city's closure, back to Wuhan: Today is the day you start reporting on the epidemic?
我被调到长报集团下面的传媒公司，负责做一些经营性的活动和业务。
I was transferred to the media company under the auspices of the Long Pao Newspaper Group to do some business activities and business.
但做职业摄影记者习惯了，平时碰到好的新闻故事专题线索，还是会去留意。
But as a professional photographer used to, usually encounter good news story thematic clues, or will pay attention to.
离开这个新闻岗位后，还做过一所山村小学的专题。
After leaving the news post, he did a project at a mountain village primary school.
这次疫情发生，正好碰上过年，记者比较缺，我家在武汉，就被抽调回来做这个报道。
The outbreak of this outbreak, just over the New Year, the reporter is relatively short, my family in Wuhan, was pulled back to do this report.
但是抽调之前，我在1月20号的时候已经开始记录了。
But before I did, I started recording on January 20th.
1月20号，钟南山院士接受央视采访，说武汉有14名医护人员感染，病毒会人传人的时候，我就知道这个事情非同一般。
In an interview with CCTV on January 20, academician Zhong Nan Shan said 14 medical workers in Wuhan were infected with the virus.
就和2003年的SARS一样，是一个非常重大的历史事件。
Just like SARS in 2003, it was a very important historical event.
我做过10多年记者，这种职业敏感性还是有的。
I've been a journalist for more than 10 years, and there's a bit of that professional sensitivity.
从1月20号到现在，我已经参与了10多天的疫情报道。
From January 20 to the present, I have been involved in more than 10 days of reports of the epidemic.
中间武汉宣布封城之前的一天晚上，我把家里的老人，我岳父岳母，还有小孩儿提前送回了老家湖北荆门，后来荆门也封城了。
One night before the announcement of the city's closure in the middle of Wuhan, I sent the old man, my father-in-law, mother-in-law and the child back to his hometown of Jingmen, Hubei Province.
第二天早上，也就是武汉封城当天，我和我老婆一起赶回武汉。
The next morning, that is, Wuhan sealing day, my wife and I rushed back to Wuhan.
她不放心我，说来了以后会监督我做好防护工作，然后还可以照顾一下我的生活。
She didn't trust me. She said she would supervise my protective work and then take care of my life.
她知道我们肯定会很忙。
She knew we were going to be busy.
1月27日，封城之后，空荡荡的桥面。
January 27, after the closure of the city, empty bridge.
轮：你刚开始接触新冠病毒疫情报道时，情形怎样？陈卓：刚开始我们对这个病毒也有点害怕。
Round: How did it go when you were first exposed to the new Crown VirusChen Zhuo: At first we were a little bit afraid of the virus.
因为毕竟SARS很厉害，你不知道感染了后，对你的身体会造成什么影响。
Because SARS is so bad after all, you don't know what effect it will have on your body if you get infected.
所以开始没有安排去医院。
So I didn't plan to go to the hospital.
后来通过人民网、央视等一些比较有公信力的媒体，还有患病医生公布的一些信息了解到，这个病对老年人，尤其是身体患有基础疾病的一些人影响比较大，对年轻人的影响还好的时候，我们也就放松了一些，后来在报社安排下，进医院开始一线的报道。
Later, through the people's network, CCTV and other more credible media, as well as some information published by the sick doctor, the disease affected the elderly, especially some people with basic diseases, when the impact on young people is good, we relaxed a little, and later arranged by the newspaper to enter the hospital to start the first line of reporting.
在做常规报道的同时，我们挖掘一些一线的医护人员的故事。
While doing our regular reporting, we unearth the stories of some of the front-line health care workers.
比如说第一个汇报疫情的医生，湖北省中西医结合医院的呼吸科主任张继先。
The first doctor to report the outbreak, Zhang Jixian, the respiratory director of Hubei combined Chinese and Western medicine hospital, for example.
我们已经采访了，也刊发了一些稿件，引起了很大的社会反响。
We have interviewed, also published some articles, caused a lot of social repercussions.
比如《一个120急救班组的武汉12小时》，像这样的一些图片故事，还有来自社区防疫一线的报告。
For example, "a 120-hour first aid team Wuhan 12 hours," such a number of picture stories, but also from the community vaccination front line report.
一个120急救班组的武汉12小时最早上报疫情的她，怎样发现这种不一样的肺炎张继先，湖北省中西医结合医院呼吸与重症医学科主任。
Wuhan, a 120-hour first-aid team, first reported the outbreak of the disease, how to find this different pneumonia Zhang Jian, Hubei Province combined with Chinese and Western medicine hospital breathing and severe medicine director.
12月底最早发现这场疫情苗头，并和院方一起上报。
Early signs of the outbreak were detected at the end of December and were reported with hospital authorities.
2019年12月26-29日，张继先先后收治了7位肺炎患者，胸片显示与其他病毒性肺炎完全不同。
On December 26-29, 2019, Zhang first treated seven patients with pneumonia, with chest X-rays showing a marked difference from other viral pneumonia.
其中7个相似病人4个来自华南海鲜。
Seven similar patients came from South China Seafood.
她将情况迅速向医院汇报，医院立即上报给江汉区疾控中心。
She will quickly report the situation to the hospital, the hospital immediately reported to the JiangHan District CDC.
12月29日上报省、市卫健委疾控处。
December 29 reported to the provincial, municipal health care and disease control office.
省、市卫健委疾控处指示武汉市疾控中心、金银潭医院和江汉区疾控中心，开始流行病学调查。
The Provincial and Municipal Health Care and Disease Control Office instructed Wuhan CDC, Gold and Silver Pool Hospital and Jianghan District CDC to begin epidemiological investigation.
武汉全线动员轮：事态发展到今天，外围的各种疫情讨论铺天盖地。
Wuhan all-line mobilization wheel: the development of today, the periphery of various epidemic discussions.
你在现场，感受到的周边的情绪和氛围是怎样的？陈卓：其实在钟南山院士宣布病毒可以人传人以后，武汉的氛围一下子就紧张起来了，每个人在各自岗位上应声而动。
Chen Zhuo: Actually, after academician Zhong Nan Shan announced that the virus could be passed from person to person, the atmosphere in Wuhan became tense and everyone responded to the call from their posts.
在一线这么多天，武汉市的整个动员力量还是非常非常广泛的。
In the first so many days, Wuhan city's entire mobilization is still very, very extensive.
所有跟防疫相关的，公务员不管是市一级，还是各区一级，街道一级，社区一级，包括各个局委办，所有人员都基本上在岗位上拼命加班加点，做好各自力所能及的防控工作。
All civil servants involved in immunization, whether at the municipal or district level, at the neighbourhood level or at the community level, including the directorates, are largely working overtime and doing whatever they can to prevent and control them.
现在社区隔离点基本建立起来了，这样可以对病患进行有效隔离。
Community isolation points are now largely in place, allowing for effective isolation of patients.
1月27日，社区工作人员周红（音）陪同一位疑似患者来医院进一步检查确诊。
On January 27, community worker Zhou Hong accompanied a suspected patient to the hospital for further examination and diagnosis.
1月27日，社区工作人员周红（音）陪同一位疑似患者来医院进一步检查确诊。
On January 27, community worker Zhou Hong accompanied a suspected patient to the hospital for further examination and diagnosis.
轮：你看到的一线现在面临的问题有哪些是亟待解决的？陈卓：我觉得现在的重点虽然是在防疫这一块儿，还是有很多群体需要关注，比如说我现在正在做一个临产孕妇的选题。
Chen Zhuo: I think the focus now is on prevention, but there are still a lot of groups that need attention, like I'm working on a topic of pregnant women in labor.
武汉有一些医院专门接收这样的孕妇，因为现在公共交通关停，有很多爱心人士自发组织车队专门转送这些即将临产的孕妇到定点医院。
Wuhan has a number of hospitals specializing in such pregnant women, because public transport is now closed, a lot of caring people spontaneously organized convoys to these imminent pregnant women to the designated hospital.
轮：在拍摄过程中，给你触动最深的是怎样的场景？陈卓：我接触的病患大多是疑似病例，因为这个病确诊起来比较麻烦。
Chen Zhuo: Most of the patients I came into contact with were suspected cases, because it was more troublesome to diagnose the disease.
给我印象最深的还是去世的那个母亲，她女儿的那一声声“妈妈”的那种哭喊，太令人心碎了。
What impressed me most was the death of the mother, her daughter's voice "mother" that cry, too heartbreaking.
这种亲人的生离死别，虽然我们每个人都会经历，但是当你真正经历这样的事情，真的是非常非常的难受。
This kind of close relative's life and death, although we all will experience, but when you really experience this kind of thing, is really very, very uncomfortable.
还有医生，那种大无畏的职业精神，确实非常令人感动。
And the doctors, that fearless professionalism, is really very moving.
整个春节，有的医生几乎就不回家，住在隔离病区。
Throughout the Spring Festival, some doctors hardly ever return home and live in isolated areas.
睡在医院或者定点的一些宾馆，或者是给他们安排的宿舍。
Sleep in a hospital or in a designated hotel, or in a dorm for them.
基本上从春节前开始，一直到现在，都在加班加点，拼命工作，他们这种精神非常令人感动。
Basically from the Spring Festival before, until now, have been working overtime, hard work, their spirit is very moving.
Play2020年2月4日凌晨一点，看着武汉市金银潭医院“渐冻人”院长张定宇拖着颤抖的双腿，一路疾走忙碌在武汉客厅隔离点现场，真的是心疼😭春节，武汉120普爱医院一名护士给女儿及家人的回信轮：看到一位凤凰卫视特约记者被感染，包括他的父母。
2007-3-1 15: 40 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Dingyu, director of Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital, watched as Zhang Dingyu, director of Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital, hurtled his trembling legs as he raced along the scene in Wuhan's living room.
你们在报道过程中，如何保障自身的安全？如何处理和家人之间的联系与沟通？陈卓：凤凰网那位记者，虽然不认识，但是作为同行，我非常关心也非常同情。
How do you ensure your own safety in your reporting process? How do you handle communication with your family? CHEN Zhuo: That reporter from Phoenix, though I don't know him, is very concerned and sympathetic as a fellow journalist.
确实，记者这个职业基本上每天都在一线，和一线的防疫人员、医生、民警接触，一定要做好自身的防护。
Indeed, the profession of journalists is basically daily in the front line, and the front-line vaccination personnel, doctors, civilian police contact, must do a good job of their own protection.
特别是到医院去的那些同事，毕竟那儿病患比较多。
Especially those who go to the hospital, after all, there are more patients there.
在进出家门的时候，一定要用含氯消毒液，或84消毒水对自己的衣物、设备进行消毒，进门时最好全身喷洒一遍，然后赶紧洗澡洗手。
Do disinfect your clothes and equipment with chlorine disinfectant or disinfectant when entering or leaving your home. Spray it all over your body when you come in and wash your hands quickly.
家中如果有老人，建议就不要跟他们呆在一起。
If there are elderly people in the family, it is advisable not to stay with them.
把自己先隔离出来，如果说一直参加这个疫情报道，最好等整个事情结束之后再与家人见面。
Isolate yourself first, and if you've been part of the story, it's best to wait until the whole thing's over before you meet your family.
现在通讯设备比较发达，如果你很想念他们，关心他们，手机视频都是非常方便的。
Now communication equipment is more developed, if you miss them very much, care about them, mobile video is very convenient.
如果他们缺生活用品，建议采购送回去的时候，放到门口，物品外包装全部用含氯消毒液或者是84消毒水喷洒一遍。
If they are short of supplies, it is recommended to buy back to the door, the outer packaging with chlorine disinfectant or 84 disinfectant spray again.
也可以用高度白酒来喷洒，过20分钟再拿进去。
You can also spray it with a high degree of white wine and bring it in after 20 minutes.
1月28日晚，一名安保人员用喇叭告知居民应对新型冠状病毒措施。
On the night of January 28, a security officer used a loudspeaker to tell residents what to do about the new coronavirus.
忠实地去记录，也不要让自己成为一个病原体轮：你是经验比较丰富的新闻摄影师，像这次报道，和以往有什么不同？陈卓：以前参与的一些报道，像汶川大地震、舟曲泥石流、东方之星沉没，都是突发事件。
Be faithful and don't let yourself become a pathogen wheel: You're a more experienced news photographer, what's different from this story? Chen Zhuo: Previous coverage, such as the Wenchuan earthquake, the Zhouqu mudslide, the sinking of the Orient Star, are all incidents.
这次确实是我从业这么多年来，报道的一个比较陌生的领域，医学领域的公共卫生事件。
This is really something I've been working in for so many years, covering a relatively unfamiliar area, the medical field of public health events.
采访中有很多不确定性，这个病毒你也不知道它到底在哪里，也不知道它何时会出现在你身边。
There's a lot of uncertainty in the interview, and you don't know where it is or when it's going to show up.
区别最大就在这儿吧，一种看不见的危险。
The greatest difference is here, an invisible danger.
轮：在这样的情形下，如何拍好照片？对自己有什么要求吗？陈卓：我觉得好的新闻照片，肯定是有情感的照片。
Wheel: How do you take a picture in such a situation? What do you want from yourself? Chen Zhuo: I think good news photos are definitely emotional ones.
一个冰冷的旁观者，随意按下快门，照片肯定打动不了读者。
A cold bystander, press the shutter at will, and the photos won't impress the readers.
所以一定要注意抓住拍摄对象流露情感的那一瞬间。
So be sure to grab the moment when the subject is showing emotion.
这次采访对自己也没有什么要求，保护好自己。
This interview also has no request to oneself, protects oneself.
保护好家人，不要让自己成为一个病原体就好了。
Protect your family and don't let yourself become a pathogen.
忠实地记录吧，还不知道这样的日子会持续多久。
Keep a record of how long it will last.
有时候心情很down，这不仅仅只是一场传染病，从全局看，对经济的影响，特别是对私营业主的影响非常大，还有对我们每一个普普通通的人特别是打工者来说。
This is not just an infectious disease, but the impact on the economy in general and on private owners in particular, as well as on every single one of us, especially the wage-earner, is very high.
今年太难了！因为封城和市区私家车禁行，空荡的鹦鹉洲长江大桥上，行车寥寥，只有那一身洁白闪着蓝光的救护车，如暗夜里的精灵，为这座寂寞的城市送来光明。
It's so hard this year! Because of the ban on private cars in the city and in the city, the empty bridge over the Yangtze River in Parrot Island is very few in traffic, and only the ambulance with white and blue light, like a spirit in the night, brings light to this lonely city.
