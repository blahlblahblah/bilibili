这个春节，我在北京送外卖。
I'll take it out in Beijing this Spring Festival.
“我来了这一个月，感觉什么狗屁没弄下来，这会儿回去也不方便。
"I've been here for a month and I don't feel like I've got any shit coming down. It's not convenient to go back now.
感觉很那个啥……心里很不得劲儿。
Feels like that What... I'm not feeling very good.

《死亡搁浅》？我没玩过。
Death Grounding? I've never played.
那是啥游戏？送快递的？哦……我还真没注意，那回头我下一个试试。
What's that game? Courier? Oh... I didn't pay attention. Then I'll give it a try next time.
。
.
我玩的游戏是《新剑侠奇缘》，我在里头当指挥，指挥100多个人的家族……不能挂机，你说我当指挥能挂机不？我一有时间就玩。
The game I play is The New Swordsman Wonderland, where I'm the conductor, directing the family of more than 100 people... I can't hang up. Do you think I can hang up when I'm in command?
我在这个游戏里边也是有点名声的，好些区都走过，打得好，被朋友喊过去帮忙，给他打到第一，我就换个区。
I also have a bit of a reputation in this game, a number of districts have passed, played well, was called to help his friends, to call him first, I changed the district.
再打到第一，再换一个区。
One more call, one more zone.
。
.
你都有什么要知道的？但凡我知道的，肯定都跟你讲。
What do you want to know? Anything I know, I'm sure I'll tell you.
我老家是山西运城的，临猗县三管镇陆喜营村……这个地址你需要吗？我编辑一下发你。
My hometown is Shanxi Yuncheng, Linyi County three Guanglu Xiying Village...... Do you need this address? I edit you.
年龄跟姓名也要吗？好的。
What about your age and first name? Yes.
。
.
我以前就在北京送外卖，送了两年多，去年6月份回了趟老家，春节前想来北京再干上一个月。
I used to deliver takeaway food in Beijing for more than two years. I went back to my hometown last June and wanted to work in Beijing for another month before the Spring Festival.
我跟同村的一个哥合租，住在红寺村。
I live in Hongji Village with a brother from the same village.
村子里都是一些外地人租着，也不冷清，好多人都没回去。
The village was full of strangers who rented it, and many did not return.
。
.
我本来就打算待一个月就走。
I was going to stay for a month.
老家那边媳妇快生了，得坐月子，我着急回去。
The daughter-in-law over there is going to have a baby.
本来跟她说好的正月十五，但因为疫情的关系又拖了几天。
It was supposed to be the fifteenth day of the first month, but it was delayed a few days because of the outbreak.
她在家里边委屈得哭哭啼啼，整得我心里也不好受。
She was crying at home and it made me feel bad.
我老家那边发通知了，说是不让返乡。
I've been warned in my hometown not to return home.
我打了电话，找了门路，人家说在北京开个健康证明就能回去。
I called and found my way back to Beijing, where they said I could go back with a health certificate.
回去也不太远，坐高铁的话，5个半小时就能到运城北站。
It's not too far to go back. If you take the high-speed railway, you can get to Yuncheng North Station in five and a half hours.
正常情况下，坐公交或者拼个车到县城，然后再倒个公交到村里。
Under normal circumstances, take a bus or a car to the county, and then inverted a bus to the village.
这回得抓紧时间，因为村子晚上6点就封了。
We must hurry up this time, for the village is closed at 6 pm.
。
.
“其实飞机比高铁、动车都便宜，但去北京机场路太远了。
"Airplanes are cheaper than high-speed trains and trains, but it's too far to get to Beijing Airport Road.
”。
"
因为以前干过两年，我知道冬天，尤其是春节期间外卖这一行挺挣钱的。
Because I've worked for two years before, I know that I make a lot of money in winter, especially during the Spring Festival.
夏天就不行了，夏天是淡季，最低的单价才4块8毛钱。
Summer is not, summer is the low season, the lowest unit price is only 4 yuan 8 cents.
夏天的话，你好好跑，早上五六点起来，跑到晚上十一二点，估计能跑400多500块了不起了。
If you run well in summer, get up at five or six in the morning and run until eleven or twelve in the evening.
就这么玩命干。
Just play with your life.
冬天有天气补偿，每单可以补贴两块到三块，最低的单也不低于6块3毛钱，高峰时期，每一单保底再加两块钱，这么算下来，一天可以赚700块。
Winter weather compensation, each can be subsidized two to three pieces, the lowest single is no less than $6, 30 cents, the peak period, each Bao Bao plus two dollars, so you can earn 700 dollars a day.
。
.
是，北京生活成本是高点儿，但是自己省一点的话还是能攒下不少。
Yes, the cost of living in Beijing is a bit higher, but you can save a lot if you save a little.
吃饭带房租，乱七八糟的，一天100块钱。
Meal and rent. It's a mess. One hundred bucks a day.
这个不多。
This is not much.
攒下来的钱我自己身上只留一点，怕有个啥急事要用。
I saved a little money for myself, afraid there was something urgent to use.
有时候要帮顾客买个饭，有时候车子磕磕碰碰，都得花钱。
Sometimes I have to buy a meal for my customers, sometimes my car stumbles and I have to pay for it.
剩下的都寄回家了。
The rest is mailed home.
在老家那个村子里，我这收入水平就一般般。
In that village in my hometown, my income level is about the same.
所以过年在家闲着也是闲着，还不如出来那个啥，是不？咱这个年龄了，过年也没有小时候那么开心，总感觉一个老爷们在家里边不合适，对吧？要做点事儿，不能闲着。
So the New Year at home is idle, is not as good as out of that what is not? We are old, the New Year is not as happy as a child, always feel that a master at home is not appropriate, right? To do something, not idle.
。
.
我记得是我来北京后三四天才有的疫情。
I remember it was three or four days after I came to Beijing.
感觉新闻都还没怎么报，北京这边的口罩就缺货了。
Feel the news has not been reported, Beijing side of the mask is out of stock.
刚开始跑的时候，接的单子上口罩、吃的之类的都有，到后边全是口罩，没有什么吃的了。
At the beginning of the run, the list of a mask, eat and so on have, to the back is full of masks, there is nothing to eat.
单子上的东西都挺贵的，一个口罩加一个护目镜，我看了一下，135块5。
Everything on the list is expensive. A mask and goggles. I looked at it. 135 bucks 5.
N95口罩嘛，好口罩，不是咱们戴的这种普通的。
N95 mask, good mask, not the normal one we wear.
。
.
“我们送外卖的基本上都是以保暖为主。
"Basically, we deliver takeaway food with a focus on warmth.
棉口罩外加一个帽子，给自己脸鼻子嘴捂得严严实实，就露俩眼睛。
Cotton mask plus a hat, his face and nose covered tightly, just show their eyes.
”。
"
不管多远的单子都有，有二十几公里的，就为了买个口罩。
No matter how far the list is, there are twenty kilometers, just to buy a mask.
后来新闻上说双黄连口服液有用，双黄连一下就缺货了。
Later on the news said Shuang Huanglian oral liquid useful, Shuang Huanglian on the shortage of goods.
有些人不惜花高价让我们骑手帮买，但根本就买不到。
Some people pay a lot of money for our riders, but they can't buy it at all.
。
.
没过多久，小区也开始进不去了。
It wasn't long before the neighborhood began to get out.
个别小区白天进不了，晚上可以进。
Individual neighborhoods can't get in by day. You can go in at night.
刚开始有的小区不让进，我也不知道，直接骑进去，人家保安让出来。
At the beginning of some small area not to enter, I do not know, riding directly in, other people give way to security.
出来就出来吧，但有的保安说话不好听，有时候难免叨叨那么两句。
Come out to come out, but some security guards are not easy to hear, sometimes inevitable garrulous so two sentences.
后来我都不进小区，快到的时候就给顾客打电话，让他们出来拿，这样的话单量少了很多。
Later I did not enter the community, when the time came to call customers, let them out to pick up, such a much less volume.
人家要点外卖，就是为了让你能送到门口，你说送不过去……对吧？。
People order take-out, so that you can send to the door, you said you can not send... right?
我哪儿都送，最经常跑的是南三环到东三环这一带，这里的小区我一般用不着导航，基本上各方面都知道，直接就过去了。
I send everywhere, the most often running is the South Third Ring Road to the East Third Ring this area, I generally do not need navigation here, basically all aspects know, directly past.
这段时间很多路都封了，每隔一段路就有个岗哨，有人在那儿挡着。
It was a time when many roads were closed, and there was a sentry post at intervals, blocked by men.
量了体温填了表，车也不能骑进去，人只能走着进去，可麻烦。
After taking temperature to fill out the table, the car can not ride in, people can only walk in, but trouble.
而且很多路导航能导过去，但实际上不通，你都走一半了，一看路不通，又得折回去重新找路，走着特别费时间。
And a lot of road navigation can lead through, but actually do not make sense, you have to walk half, look at the road, and have to turn back to find a new way, walking a special time.
我经常在大半夜送东西，晚上乌漆麻黑的啥也看不见，有时候导航给你导到犄角旮旯里面。
I often send things in the middle of the night, when I can't see anything black and black. Sometimes navigation leads to nooks and nooks.
遇到这种情况只能跟顾客打个招呼，一般都会同意让我提前点个“送达”。
This situation can only say hello to customers, will generally agree to let me order a "delivery" ahead of time.
特殊时期，大家都挺好说话。
In special times, people are very talkative.
。
.
那天早上跑夜班，跑到凌晨4点多的时候，我一下接了6单，都是同一个早餐店的，结果取餐的地方路口封了，也是车不让进，要先量体温、填表，然后人走进去。
That morning when I was on the night shift, at 4: 00 a.m., I picked up six tickets, all from the same breakfast store. As a result, the place where the meal was taken was blocked and the car was not allowed in.
我走了几百米，到里边才发现商家是关着的……但它在平台上一直保持接单发单的状态。
I walked hundreds of meters to find the store was closed... but it has been on the platform to keep single-issue status.
我站在那儿给商家打电话，打了三四十个电话没人接。
I stood there and phoned the merchant and made thirty or forty calls, but no one answered.
。
.
遇到这种情况就得向平台报备，照个相确认商家关门了。
Such a situation must be reported to the platform to confirm the closure of the business.
但当时4点多，天还没亮，我又报备不了。
But it was past four o'clock, and I could not report before it was light.
我只好挨个给顾客打电话，给顾客都说好了以后，开着闪光灯勉强拍了几张照片。
I had to call each customer one by one, said to the customer, after the flash reluctantly took a few photos.
照片不清晰的话，人家会判你虚假报备……一个虚假报备会扣50到200块钱。
If the photograph is not clear, you will be found guilty of making a false declaration... A false statement will deduct $50 to $200.
。
.
我从4点多耗到早上7点才把这个事儿处理完。
I didn't finish this until seven in the morning until four o'clock.
这两三个小时就相当于没跑，没挣到钱。
These two or three hours are equivalent to not running and not earning money.
当时特别生气，因为我那会儿在冲单，就差这6单，我就可以领到168块钱的通宵奖了。
I was very angry, because I was punching a bill at the moment, and the only six I needed was an overnight prize of 168 yuan.
结果全耽误了，自个儿还冷得要命，跟个傻子似的。
All was lost, and he was as cold as a fool himself.
一天跑回来，脚都没感觉了。
I ran back all day without feeling my feet.
。
.
我感觉今年跑单人数比往年要多。
I feel there are more runners this year than usual.
很明显，因为往年单出来了没有什么人抢，你可以放心地挑自己想跑的，今年很多单出来直接就被抢跑了。
Obviously, because the previous year out of the single no one snatch, you can easily pick their own want to run, this year a lot of single out directly run.
大家都以为今年年景挺好，就回来送外卖了，结果遇到疫情，猝不及防。
Everyone thought the year was good, so they returned to take it out, only to be caught off guard by the outbreak.
单少了，人没少……困住了，对，相当于说大家都被这个事情给困住了。
There are fewer people... trapped... yes, it's like saying that everyone is trapped by this thing.
。
.
以前单子多的时候，整天都在外面跑，一般上午9点多10点出去，下午两三点回来睡个觉，晚上9点多10点再出去，跑到凌晨四五点。
I used to run outside all day long when I had a long list. Usually I went out at 9: 00 am and went to bed at 2 or 3 pm.
也有的时候从上午9点多10点一直跑到晚上10点。
There are also times when you run from 9: 00 a.m. to 10: 00 p.m.
这样跑一天下来能跑掉两块电瓶，也就是跑大概300公里，近单能接个30多到40单，长途的话能接个一二十单。
At the end of the day, you can run two batteries, that is, about 300 kilometers, close to 30 to 40, long distance can take a dozen.
。
.
这几天不行了。
Not these days.
像今天就特别少，全是小近单，也就20单左右，有时候都不到20单。
Like today is very few, all are close to a single, that is, about 20, sometimes less than 20.
一白天都在外面跑着，也跑完了两块电瓶，但就跑了200来块钱，干得属实是累。
I ran outside all day and finished two batteries, but I ran about $200. It was tiring to do the right thing.
平台补贴？没啥补贴，就是平常那些奖励，问题是像今天这样跑，单量根本冲不上去，达不到奖励的标准。
Platform subsidies? No subsidies, just the usual rewards. The problem is that you can't run like this, you can't get to the point where you can't get a reward.
所以这会儿在外头跑外卖的少了很多，很多人出去就在外边坐着。
So there's a lot less take-out out there right now, and a lot of people are sitting outside.
没有单，谁也没有办法。
No one can do anything without it.
。
.
我来了这一个月，感觉什么狗屁没弄下来，这会儿回去也不方便。
I've been here for a month, and I don't think it's convenient to go back now.
感觉很那个啥……心里很不得劲儿。
Feels like that What... I'm not feeling very good.
。
.
你要说凄凉的话……是有点儿？特别是晚上，到了街上，红绿灯跟前一个车没有，根本都不用等红绿灯了。
You're going to say something bleak... it's a little bit? Especially at night, there's no traffic light at the traffic lights, not even waiting for the traffic lights.
整条大路就你自己一个人骑电动车在跑，一个人没有，一个车没有，就那个样子。
You're on the whole road on your own. There's no one, no car, that's all.
。
.
其实我也感觉不到什么凄凉，因为一门心思都在赶时间。
In fact, I do not feel any desolation, because all thoughts are in a hurry.
这会儿没车了，我骑得贼快，就没啥好凄凉的。
Now there is no car, I ride fast thieves, there is no good desolate.
反倒是每年春节过完以后，北京堵的那时候，到哪儿都是车，都是红绿灯，还不如过年这段时间呢。
Instead, the Spring Festival is over every year, Beijing blocked the time, everywhere is a car, are traffic lights, than the New Year's time.
咱送外卖的，都是争取第一时间送过去，让人能吃上热乎东西。
I sent to take away, are the first time to send over, so that people can eat hot stuff.
有时候交通乱七八糟的，有时候导航错了，有时候找不着地儿，各种各样的原因……其实吧，每个送外卖的心里都是这个想法，都想以最快的速度把东西交到顾客手上，没有一个不是。
Sometimes the traffic was messy, sometimes the navigation was wrong, sometimes there was no place to find it, for all sorts of reasons... Actually, every takeaway heart wants to put things in the hands of customers as quickly as possible, and no one is wrong.
他难道不想提前送过去吗？超时得罚钱。
Doesn't he want to send it early? Penalty for overtime.
再说了，这一单不结束下一单也开始不了。
Besides, the next order won't start until the end of the order.
你干得越快，你就越能多接几单。
The faster you work, the more you can catch more.
所以我们送外卖，逆行、抄近道、闯红灯都是常有的事儿。
So we send take-out, retrograde, shortcut, red light is often the case.
有时候也会被逮到罚款，但是为了赶时间，你有很多不得不去做的事儿，你知道吧？。
Sometimes you get caught with a fine, but you have a lot of work to do to make time, you know?
这段时间大家都难。
These are hard times for everyone.
我在接订单的时候也看到过，有的顾客给我们写的备注是，“我实在是饿得不行了，你只要能给我送过来，多晚都行”。
I saw it when I got my order, and some of the customers wrote us notes, "I'm so hungry, it's just as late as you can get it to me."
因为有的地方封锁了，实在进不去，或者得绕上一大圈，骑手都不愿意接这种单。
The rider was reluctant to accept the order because it was blocked in some places and it was impossible to get in, or because it had to go round the block.
看到这种情况，我只要手上没单，都会尽力给他送过去。
Seeing this situation, as long as I do not have a single, I will do my best to send him.
人都已经这么说了，对不对？属实是难。
That's what people say, isn't it? It's hard to be true.
你以前看谁这么点过外卖？没有。
Who have you ever seen so much take-out before? No.
现在是特殊时间，必须得特殊对待。
This is a special time that must be given special treatment.
。
.
“我们也算是前线的人吧？”。
"Are we on the front line, too?"
反正最近单子也少了，只要不是特别过分的要求，我都尽量去送。
In any case, the recent list is also less, as long as it is not particularly excessive requirements, I try to send.
有让我带包烟的，有让我带点日用品的，都是顺带脚的事儿，顾客到那儿也挺感激你的。
There are those who let me pack cigarettes, some let me bring some groceries, are all incidental things, customers there are also very grateful to you.
本来也不求打赏什么的，人要多给点儿，感觉还挺不好意思的。
Originally also did not ask for reward or anything, people give more, feel quite embarrassed.
。
.
我印象比较深的一个事儿是，有天夜里11点多，在方庄芳古路附近，我正送外卖，碰到一个姑娘拦车。
One of the things that struck me more deeply was that one night near Fangzhuang Fangguo Road, I was delivering takeaway goods when I met a girl stopping her car.
她在路边跟我招手，我就停下来了。
She waved to me on the curb and I stopped.
她声音带着哭腔，说大半夜的太冷了，手机都冻关机了，打不着车。
Her voice cried, saying that it was too cold in the middle of the night and that her cell phone was frozen and could not be turned off.
我问她去哪，她说了一个小区，刚好也不远。
I asked her where she was going, and she said there was a neighborhood, just not far away.
她说你可以载我吗，我说可以，没什么不可以，你要不怕我的话，你这个小区我知道在哪，我送你回去。
She said you could give me a ride, I said yes, nothing No, you don't have to be afraid of me, You know where the neighborhood I know, I'll take you back.
她说，你不怕我得了那个病吗？我说，我年轻抵抗力好，不怕。
said she; are you not afraid that I am ill? I said, I am young and resistant.
。
.
路上我去顺道取了个餐，刚好有个超市，她说她饿了，还没吃饭，我说那怎么办呢，她说想去超市买点东西。
On the way to pick up a meal, happened to have a supermarket, she said she was hungry, has not eaten, I said how to do that, she said to go to the supermarket to buy something.
我说你有钱吗，她说有，但她手机关机付不了账，我说我给你垫呗，就给她垫了25块钱，最后给她送到小区门口。
I said you have money, she said yes, but her cell phone shut down can not pay the bill, I said I give you pad, she paid 25 yuan, finally sent her to the community door.
她让我加一下她微信，回去了她给我转账，我说行吧，就加了。
She asked me to add a message to her, she went back to me to transfer money, I said OK, it's added.
。
.
后来她到家里边给客服打了电话，客服又找到了我，说她要送我锦旗。
Later she went home to call the customer service, the customer service found me, said she would give me the flag.
我说不用那个东西。
I said I didn't need that.
大过年的，路上不管是男的女的，碰到能帮就帮一把。
Big New Year's Day, whether the road is male and female, encounter can help a.
我跟她说你要过意不去，把超市垫的那二十几块钱整我就行，我送你这一趟就是顺带脚的事儿。
I told her you'd be sorry to take the twenty dollars off the supermarket mats and I'll just drop you off on this trip.
然后她给我转了个88.88。
Then she gave me a turn of 88.88.
我一看，嘿呀，转还挺多……我挺不好意思的。
Look at me. Hey, there's a lot going on... I'm sorry.
本来就是一个举手之劳，人家又是送锦旗，又给你一个88.88，你也就垫付了25块钱而已。
Originally is a raised hand, others are the flag, and give you a 88.88, you also paid 25 yuan in advance.
。
.
我以前也遇到过这样的情况，出于好心给人家垫了钱，完事回去联系不到人了……就被骗过一次。
I have encountered such a situation before, out of good intentions to pay people, after the business back to contact no one... was cheated once.
你问我还会不会选择相信别人？也不是相信不相信的问题。
Do you ask me if I would choose to trust others? Nor do I believe in unbelief.
我就想，你有这几十块钱也富不了，少这几十块钱也穷不了，对吧？全当帮人一次的，也没啥。
I just thought you wouldn't be rich with a few dozen dollars, and you wouldn't be poor without a few dollars, would you?
。
.
大年三十那天晚上我也跑了，跑到半夜，12点多我跟我同村那个哥找了个地儿吃饭，一人吃了碗兰州拉面，还点了一把烤肉串，想着过年咱也多吃点肉。
I ran into the middle of the night, 12 more than my brother and I found a place to eat, one person ate a bowl of Lanzhou noodles, but also ordered a roast kebab, think of the New Year we also eat more meat.
平时吃的话就一碗面，越便宜越好，哪儿便宜搁哪儿吃，哪儿经济实惠搁哪儿吃，能吃饱就行。
Usually eat on a bowl of noodles, the cheaper the better, where cheap put where to eat, where economic benefits where to eat, can eat full.
。
.
那天去的时候店里还有很多人，全是男的，一桌一桌坐着，吃饭喝酒。
At the time of the day, there were many people in the shop, all men, sitting at tables, eating and drinking.
叫我们骑手坐那儿，我们也不好意思凑热闹，都是去找个门口，犄角旮旯地儿，坐那吃吃。
Tell us to ride there, we are also embarrassed to take part in the lively, is to find a door, nook and cranny, sit there to eat.
因为我总感觉穿着这衣服……干外卖这一行，很多人心底都有点瞧不起这个职业，所以咱们也自觉一点。
Because I always feel like I'm in this... take-out business, and a lot of people have a little disdain for it from the bottom of their hearts, so we're also aware of it.
其实所有送外卖的基本都是这样，除非像一些饭馆给我们骑手有打折优惠，一到打折那个时间段，店里全是骑手。
In fact, all takeout deliveries are basically like this, unless there's a discount for our riders like some restaurants, which are full of riders when it comes to discounts.
那会儿就能随意坐了，没有压力。
I'll be able to sit here at will. No pressure.
。
.
咱这大过年的不在家里边，心里本来也就空落落的。
We are not at home in the New Year, the heart was also empty.
过年期间一般餐送到以后，顾客都会说句新年好，咱心里也暖。
During the New Year, the general food delivery, customers will say a good New Year, we also warm in the heart.
好的商家？也有。
Good businessmen? Yes, too.
我上次去了家炸鸡店送外卖，人商家给了一份炸鸡柳炸鸡腿，一大份。
The last time I went to a fried chicken restaurant to take away, the seller gave me a fried chicken leg, a large portion.
人家说，过年期间都不容易，所有骑手到我这里接餐都给。
They say that it is not easy to celebrate the New Year, all riders come to me to receive meals.
我看着那一份也不少，少说也得三四十块钱。
I looked at that too, and got thirty or forty dollars, at least.
你说商家平时有个活动也常见，但这会儿特殊情况，大多商家都关门，这边人家还给你一个这个……我感觉心里暖暖的。
You said that businesses usually have a common activity, but this special circumstances, most businesses are closed, this side of the house to give you this... I feel warm.
。
.
是，很多人都有点瞧不起送外卖的，我觉得干这行有点儿被孤立的感觉，所有人都觉得这是一个风吹日晒跑腿的活儿，门槛低，什么人都有。
Yeah, a lot of people look down on take-out, and I think it's a bit of an isolated thing to do, and everyone thinks it's a tough job, low-threshold, everyone has.
像我跟你说的，小区不让进，让保安给赶出来，这种事儿在我和我朋友身上都发生过。
Like I told you, the neighborhood wouldn't let it in, let the security guard out, and it happened to me and my friends.
你好好说的话双方都理解，对不对？你直接骂人就不好了，你也是个干保安的，工作性质都是一样的，都是靠自己努力在挣钱。
You both understand what you're saying, don't you? You're just a security guard, you're all the same job, you're trying to make money on your own.
你说敲门给人送餐，你门也不开，或者开开露俩手指头，拿去以后“夸嚓”一摔就把门关上了，咱心里也不好受。
If you say you can't open a door for a meal, or open your fingers, and then you drop it and shut the door.
。
.
总归这一部分人比例占得不大，不到20%吧。
This group accounts for a small proportion, less than 20 per cent.
大多数都是好人。
Most of them are good people.
一多半人都会说“辛苦了”“谢谢您”之类的，疫情期间有点麻烦事儿，你跟顾客说一下，顾客也理解。
More than half the people will say "hard" "thank you" and so on, there is a bit of trouble during the epidemic, you tell the customer, and the customer understands.
人和人之间能更加互相体谅？是，反而感觉还行。
Can people understand each other more? Yes, it feels okay instead.
这段时间虽然挣钱少了，心情还不错。
I am in a good mood even though I make less money.
。
.
“下雪天是不跑的，电瓶车滑得厉害，一刹车就倒了。
"It's not going to run in the snow. The electric car skidded so hard that the brakes fell.
”。
"
你问如果再给我一次机会的话来不来北京？说实话，如果不是家里边媳妇这事儿的话，我也不着急回去，在北京等这疫情结束了，我再回去也来得及。
To tell you the truth, if it wasn't for my daughter-in-law at home, I wouldn't be in a hurry to go back to Beijing until the epidemic is over and I'll be back in time.
这段时间属实北京没什么单，但也能跑，我也愿意配合疫情的这个工作。
This period is true Beijing does not have a single, but also can run, I am willing to cooperate with the epidemic of this work.

这次回老家以后，我一有空就会回北京来。
I'll come back to Beijing as soon as I have time.
去年6月回老家是因为什么呢，一个是我媳妇怀孕了，她以前也跟着我在北京，怀了孕就回了老家；另一个是我被人偷了一回餐。
One was my daughter-in-law who was pregnant, and she used to follow me in Beijing. She got pregnant and went home. The other is that I was stolen a meal.
当时是半夜3点多，我到小区里送餐，一个28楼的小区，我现在都记着那个门牌号：22308。
It was 3: 00 in the middle of the night, I sent food to the community, a 28-floor community, I now remember that the number: 22308.
当时箱子里有5份餐，我提了一份上去，送完以后下来，箱子里一份餐都没有了。
There were five meals in the box. I carried one. When I finished, there was not a single meal left in the box.
那会儿我还没发现，到了下一个送餐地点拿餐的时候，打开箱子一看，什么都没有了。
By that time, I had not found out. When I got to the next meal place to get the meal, I opened the box and found nothing.
我只能挨个给所有顾客打电话，跟他们说很抱歉，让您久等了，这个餐被偷了，我也没招儿，多少钱我原价赔付给您。
I can only call all the customers one by one and tell them that I'm sorry to have kept you waiting. The meal was stolen and I can't find anything.
。
.
顾客买餐一般都有打折券的，但因为让人家等了很长时间，咱也不好意思，咱都是按原价赔偿人家。
Customers usually have discount coupons, but because people have been waiting a long time, I am sorry, we are the original price of compensation.
我被偷了大概300多块钱的餐，前前后后赔了500多块钱。
I lost more than $500 before and after I was robbed of about 300 dollars worth of food.
我也报警了，去了派出所，警察让我回去等消息，到后边也就不了了之了。
I also called the police, went to the police station, the police asked me to go back to wait for the news, after the end of it.
。
.
这些的事儿就让我感觉很无助。
It makes me feel helpless.
这么大的一个城市，没有自己的一席之地。
A city of this size has no place of its own.
所以我才会有时间就玩玩游戏，不然你回到家，屋里边空荡荡的，一个人窝着，感觉一般人受不了这个。
That's why I have the time to play games, or you come home, the house empty, a nest, the general feeling that this is intolerable.
老想着家里边什么样子，过得顺不顺畅，感觉有心无力，使不上劲儿。
Always think of what the home look like, living smoothly, feeling powerless, not strong.
是，家里边人是要我在外头挣钱，但家里边人也要你在家里边陪着他们啊。
Yes, the family wanted me to earn money outside, but the family wanted you to be at home with them.
。
.
之后媳妇生了小孩咋办？哦，我在老家工地上还有个开大吊的活儿，就是工地上特别高的、上面可以转过来转过去的那种车。
Oh, I still have a big job on my home construction site. It's the kind of car on the construction site that can be turned around.
简单来说就是盖房子吧。
Simply put, building a house.
在那里干活的话，每天晚上都可以回家。
You can go home every night if you work there.
等工地上有了空档期，我会再来北京。
I will come to Beijing again when there is a gap on the construction site.
那个时候媳妇基本上就可以自己看小孩了，我就可以跟往常一样，该挣钱挣钱，该干嘛干嘛。
At that time, the daughter-in-law can basically take care of the children by themselves, so I can earn money and do what I do as usual.
。
.
哦哦，没啥问题了是吧？生活照好像没有……我都处理掉了。
Oh, there's nothing wrong with it, is there? Life doesn't seem to be... I've dealt with it all.
我手机平时玩游戏嘛，有点儿卡，所以我没事老清理内存，把东西都删完了。
My mobile phone usually play games, a bit of card, so I have no time to clean up memory, delete everything.
我快手上有段子，送外卖时候拍的一些段子，你要不要？就两个，一个是穿了工作服的，一个是没穿工作服的……可以发出来，没事。
I've got a piece in my hand that's from takeaway, you want it? Just two, one in overalls, the other in overalls... it's okay.
