2020年2月9日，钟南山院士所在的研究团队在医学类论文预印本平台 medRxiv 上提交了一份有关新型冠状病毒感染者临床特征的论文《Clinical characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus infection in China》（中国新型冠状病毒感染的临床特征）。
On February 9, 2020, Zhongnan University's research team presented a paper on clinical features of new coronavirus infections in China (clinical features of the new coronavirus infection in China) on the clinical characteristics of new coronavirus infections.
这是钟南山研究团队首次提交的有关新型冠状病毒的研究。
This is the first study on the coronavirus presented by the Zhong Nan Shan research team.
该论文的作者有30多名，共同第一作者14名。
The paper was written by more than 30 authors and 14 co-lead authors.
钟南山院士为通讯作者。
Academician Zhong Nan Shan is a correspondence writer.
论文公布后，其中新型冠状病毒“最长潜伏期24天”引发了公众的热议。
After the publication of the paper, one of the new coronavirus "maximum incubation period of 24 days" caused public debate.
这一论述打破了之前“14天潜伏期”的判断，也令人们开始怀疑“14天隔离”的有效性。
The argument breaks with the previous "14-day incubation period" and raises questions about the effectiveness of the "14-day isolation."
据研究团队核心成员关伟杰2月10日接受媒体采访时表示，“24天潜伏期”属于个案。
The 24-day incubation period is a case in point, Guan Weijie, a core member of the research team, told reporters on Feb. 10.
而且，该论文尚未通过同行评议，暂时不能指导临床实践。
Moreover, the paper has not passed peer review and is temporarily unable to guide clinical practice.
如果将这篇论文与2020年1月30日发表于《柳叶刀》的论文《武汉市2019新型冠状病毒性肺炎99例流行病学和临床特征：一项描述性研究》进行比较，会发现一些细微的区别。
A comparison of this paper with 99 epidemiological and clinical features of 2019 new coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan city: a descriptive study, published in The Lancet on January 30, 2020, reveals some subtle differences.
临床回顾性研究论文《中国新型冠状病毒感染的临床特征》是针对新型冠状病毒感染者的临床回顾性研究。
Clinical Retrospective Study on the Clinical Features of New Coronavirus Infection in China is a retrospective study of new coronavirus infections.
论文中，数据截至2020年1月29日，研究对象为1099名新型冠状病毒感染实验室确诊患者，他们来自31个省（自治区、直辖市）的552家医院。
As of January 29, 2020, the subjects of the study were 1,099 patients diagnosed with a new coronavirus infection laboratory in 552 hospitals in 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government.
论文的结论大致有以下几点：新型冠状病毒的潜伏期中位数是3天，最短为0天，最长可达24天；其致死率低于SARS和MERS（中东呼吸综合征）；早期有43.8%的病人发热，但住院后出现发热症状的占87.9%；不发热感染者比SARS和MERS的感染者更加常见；部分患者在早期CT检查中并未表现出放射学影像异常，仅靠CT确诊新型冠状病毒感染的准确率只达到76.4%；在尿液、唾液、胃肠道中都能找到新冠病毒；不排除超级传播者存在的可能；腹泻（3.7%）和呕吐（5.0%）并非常见症状。
The median incubation period of the new coronavirus was 3 days, the lowest 0 days and the longest 24 days. The mortality rate was lower than that of SARS and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome).
《新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎诊疗方案（试行第五版）》，将“疑似病例具有肺炎影像学特征者”作为湖北省临床诊断病例标准在入院病例中，82.1%的患者发生淋巴细胞减少，36.2%的患者有血小板減少的症状。
The Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia from New Coronavirus Infection (Trial Version 5) identified "suspected cases with pneumonia imaging features" as the standard for clinical diagnosis in Hubei Province. In 82.1% of cases, lymphocytes were reduced and in 36.2% of cases thrombocytopenia was observed.
总体而言，33.7%的病人白细胞减少。
Overall, leucocytes decreased in 33.7 per cent of patients.
大部分病人都展现为C-反应蛋白增加，但是谷丙转氨酶、天冬氨酸转氨酶、肌酸激酶和D-二聚体的增加相对不常见。
Most patients showed increased C-reactive protein, but increases in glutaminase, aspartic aminotransferase, creatine kinase and D-dimer were relatively uncommon.
在研究样本中，患者平均年龄为47岁，41.9%是女性；死亡率为1.36%，约2.2%的病人要插管，进ICU的病人占5%。
In the study samples, the average age of the patients was 47 years, 41.9% were women; the mortality rate was 1.36%, about 2.2% of patients were intubated, and 5% of patients were admitted to ICU.
从上述论证中可以得知，如果只靠体温检测筛选感染者，很多病人会被漏诊；胃肠道分泌物的传播需要得到进一步的重视；同时，在1099名样本中，2.09%是医务工作者，仅有1.18%的人接触过野生动物，71.80%的人与来自武汉的人有过接触，进一步为“人传人”的传播途径提供了证据。
From the foregoing discussion, it can be concluded that many patients will be missed if they are screened only for body temperature testing; the spread of gastrointestinal secretions needs further attention; and, of the 1,099 samples, 2.09 per cent are health workers, only 1.18 per cent have ever had contact with wildlife, and 71.80 per cent have had contact with people from Wuhan, providing further evidence of "person-to-person" transmission.
描述性研究根据发表于2020年1月30日《柳叶刀》的论文《武汉市2019新型冠状病毒性肺炎99例流行病学和临床特征：一项描述性研究》（Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia inWuhan, China: a descriptive study）显示，入院时，大多数患者发烧或咳嗽，三分之一的患者呼吸急促。
Descriptive studies based on the paper "Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019 new coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan city: a descriptive study of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a description study, showed that on admission, most patients had a fever or cough and a third had shortness of breath.
其他症状包括肌肉疼痛、头痛、意识模糊、胸痛和腹泻。
Other symptoms include muscle pain, headache, blurred consciousness, chest pain and diarrhoea.
许多患者出现器官功能损害，包括17例ARDS，8例急性呼吸系统损伤，3例急性肾损伤，4例败血性导致的休克和1例呼吸机相关性肺炎。
Many patients suffered from organ dysfunction, including 17 cases of ARDS, 8 cases of acute respiratory injury, 3 cases of acute renal injury, 4 cases of septic shock and 1 case of ventilator-related pneumonia.
该研究纳入了99例新型冠状病毒患者，其中两个是夫妻。
The study included 99 new coronavirus patients, two of whom were couples.
共有49名患者具有接触华南海鲜市场的历史。
A total of 49 patients have a history of exposure to the South China seafood market.
其中，有47名具有长期接触史的患者，其中大多数是销售员或市场经理，还有2名具有短期接触史的患者是购物者。
There were 47 patients with a long history of exposure, most of them salespeople or marketing managers, and two patients with a short history of exposure were shoppers.
案例中没有医务人员。
There were no medical personnel in the case.
大多数患者是男性，平均年龄为55·5岁。
Most of the patients were men, with an average age of 55. 5 years.
50名患者患有慢性疾病，包括心脑血管疾病、内分泌系统疾病、消化系统疾病，呼吸系统疾病、恶性肿瘤和神经系统疾病。

43名患者的肝功能异常程度不同，丙氨酸转氨酶（ALT）或天冬氨酸转氨酶（AST）高于正常范围；1例患者肝功能严重受损。
In 43 patients with abnormal liver function, alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartic aminotransferase (AST) was higher than normal.
大多数患者的心肌酶谱异常，其中13名患者的肌酸激酶升高，75名患者的乳酸脱氢酶升高。
Myocardial enzyme profiles were abnormal in most patients, with elevated creatine kinase in 13 patients and lactate dehydrogenase in 75 patients.
7名患者的肾功能遭到不同程度的损害，血液尿素氮或血清肌酐升高。
Kidney function was impaired to varying degrees in seven patients, and blood urea nitrogen or serum creatinine was elevated.
在感染指标的测试中，大多数患者的血清铁蛋白高于正常范围。
In the test of infection index, the serum ferritin of most patients is higher than normal range.
研究者还对73名患者的C反应蛋白进行了测试，其中86%的患者的水平都高于正常范围。
The researchers also tested the C-reactive protein in 73 patients, 86% of whom were above the normal range.
根据胸部X线和CT检查，有74名患者表现为双侧肺炎，而仅有25名患者表现为单侧肺炎。
According to chest X-ray and CT examination, 74 patients showed bilateral pneumonia, while only 25 showed unilateral pneumonia.
14名患者表现出肺部多处斑驳和磨玻璃样混浊。
Fourteen patients showed multiple pulmonary mottling and abrasive glass-like opacity.
另外，1名患者发生气胸。
In addition, one patient developed pneumothorax.
进一步检测钟南山院士团队的论文样本更多（多了1000人），也补充了一些发表日期较早的论文所未提及的临床特征，如“在尿液、唾液、胃肠道中都能找到新冠病毒”；同时指出“腹泻和呕吐并不常见”。
Further testing of a team of Chung Nan Shan academicians included a larger sample of papers (1,000 more), as well as clinical features not mentioned in older papers, such as "a new crown virus found in urine, saliva, and gastrointestinal tract"; and that "diarrhea and vomiting are uncommon."
另外，C反应蛋白增加是一项得到印证的临床特征，但肝功能异常的情况被认为“并不常见”。
In addition, increased C-reactive protein is a confirmed clinical feature, but abnormal liver function is considered "uncommon."
从治疗方法上看，输氧、机械通气、静脉抗生素和奥司他韦治疗分别在38%、6.1%、57.5%和35.8%的患者中使用。
In terms of treatment methods, oxygen, mechanical ventilation, intravenous antibiotics and oseltamivir treatment were used in 38 per cent, 6.1 per cent, 57.5 per cent and 35.8 per cent, respectively.
重症患者接受机械通气的比例明显高于非重症患者。
The rate of mechanical ventilation was significantly higher in severe patients than in non-severe patients.
全身性糖皮质类固醇给予率为18.6%，重症组高于非重症组。
The systemic glucocorticosteroid administration rate was 18.6%, higher in severe group than in non-severe group.
此外，5例重症病患采用体外膜氧合（ECMO）疗法，重症病患并未应用。
In addition, ECMO therapy was used in 5 patients with severe cases, but not in severe cases.
总体来看，论文对现有的诊疗方法提出了新要求，如诊断不应过度依赖发热症状，且仅依赖CT诊断也存在一定比例的漏诊情况，具体操作时需要结合流行病学史、影像学和血常规来综合判断。
On the whole, the paper puts forward new requirements for the existing diagnosis and treatment methods, such as the diagnosis should not rely too much on fever symptoms, and only rely on CT diagnosis there is a certain proportion of missed diagnosis, the specific operation needs to combine epidemiological history, imaging and blood routine to judge.
另外，消化道这一传播途径也需要进一步的观察和检测。
In addition, the alimentary canal as a means of transmission also needs further observation and testing.
值得注意的是，钟南山院士团队的这篇论文可能正处于其他重要医学期刊（如《柳叶刀》《英国医学期刊》等）的同行评议的过程中，可能会进行一些修正，最终结论应以正式发表的论文为准。
It is worth noting that this paper by the Chung Nan Shan team may be undergoing peer review in other important medical journals, such as The Lancet and the British Medical Journal. The final conclusions should be based on the published papers.
2月11日，钟南山在接受路透社采访时还提到了李文亮医生，他认为“他早在十二月底就把真相告诉人们”，是中国的英雄。
In an interview with Reuters on Feb. 11, Zhong Nan Shan also referred to Dr. Li Wenliang, a Chinese hero who said "he told the truth as early as the end of December."
