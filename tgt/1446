从春节持续到情人节、妇女节的这个花季，一直以来都是云南鲜花行业最重要的交易时段。
From the Spring Festival to Valentine's Day, Women's Day this flower season, has been Yunnan flowers industry has been the most important trading period.
但是今年，花农们懵了。
But this year, the growers were stunned.
疫情对鲜花行业的打击，几乎是致命的。
The impact of the epidemic on the flower industry has been almost fatal.
2 月 5 日开始，云南的商户已经开始成批地扔掉卖不出的玫瑰。
From Feb. 5, merchants in Yunnan began throwing away unsold roses in droves.
2 月 6 日，云南斗南鲜花拍卖市场宣布关闭，至 2 月 10 日才重新开放，但是因为交通管制、疫情防控等原因，这个昔日最热闹的鲜花交易市场，迎来了史上最萧条的情人节档期。
The sale of flowers in Du Nan, Yunnan, was closed on February 6 and reopened on February 10, marking the deadliest Valentine's Day in history because of traffic control, disease control and other issues.
10 日当天，花拍中心的总供货量是 351.9 万枝，与去年同期相比下降 41%，而单支成交均价则创下三年最低记录，较去年同期大跌 70%。
On the same day, the total supply of flower filming centres was 3.519 million units, down 41% from the same period last year, while the average price of a single transaction hit a three-year low, down 70% from the same period last year.
而这个市场承担了全国 70%以上的鲜切花交易。
The market is responsible for more than 70% of the nation's fresh cut flowers trade.
许多花农面对运不出去的鲜花，除了一天天的销毁，也没有别的办法。
Many gardeners have no choice but to destroy the flowers day by day in the face of the flowers that cannot be transported.
昆明国际花卉拍卖交易中心 2 月 8 日发布的《关于疫情及雪灾对花卉产业及企业影响的报告》显示，今年第一季季度，云南花卉交易量约减少 8.42 亿支，交易额减少约 11.42 亿元，再加上物流、农资等各方面的投入，此次疫情加上不久前的雪灾，对整个鲜花行业造成的损失至少在 40 亿元左右。
The Kunming International Flower Auction Exchange Report on the Impact of the Epidemic and Snow Disasters on the Flower Industry and Enterprises released on Feb. 8 showed that Yunnan's flower trade volume fell by about 842 million units and about 1.142 billion yuan in volume in the first quarter of this year.
△正在被销毁的鲜花一时间，“一天上百万支玫瑰被销毁”的消息上了微博热搜，热搜背后，许多人行动了起来。
After the flower was destroyed, the news that millions of roses were destroyed in one day was ferreted on Weibo Hot Search. Many people started to move.
一间连夜开出的淘宝花店就是其中之一。
One of them is the Taobao Flower Shop, which opened overnight.
2 月 10 日，家在昆明的高华溢发了一条朋友圈：刚恢复电子交易的花卉市场没有生意，出口大受影响，大批鲜花需要寻找销路。
On February 10, a group of friends broke out in Gao Hua Hua, Kunming: flower markets that had just resumed trading electronically had no business, exports were badly affected and huge quantities of flowers needed to find a market.
远在杭州的吴小忆和高华溢是多年网友兼猫友。
Wu Xiaoyi and Gao Hua-yin, both in Hangzhou, have been friends for years.
在朋友圈看到这条信息，吴小忆把求助信息转到了自己的朋友圈，也发到了近日活跃的民间援助志愿群。
In the circle of friends to see this message, Wu Xiaoyi to help the information transferred to his circle of friends, but also recently active folk aid volunteer groups.
但是应者寥寥。
But only a few.
吴小忆也问过在北京开花店的朋友，情况也不乐观，那位朋友说，离情人节的档期太近，作为花店的备货也来不及了，更何况因为疫情的影响，没人到店，自己的生意也十分惨淡。
Wu Xiaoyi also asked his friends in Beijing Flower Shop that the situation is not optimistic, the friend said, Valentine's Day is too close to the date, as the store stock is too late, not to mention because of the impact of the epidemic, no one to the store, their own business is very bleak.
人们没法出门去花店了，走线上卖行不行？志愿者群里的果果举手了，她有一个闲置的淘宝服装店，店内没什么装修，也没有商品在架上，但是如果只需要做一个商品链接，这个店铺现在的状态足够用了。
People can't go out to a florist's, can't they sell it online? Fruit and fruit in the volunteer group have raised their hands, she has a spare Taobao clothing store with no decoration and no merchandise on the shelf, but with just a link, the store is now in good condition.
△热心买家发来的买家秀就这样，吴小忆提出义卖的点子，果果拿出自己的空淘宝店，高华溢则在昆明当地负责联络花农。
Wu Xiaoyi came up with an idea for a sale. Fruit and fruit took out his own empty Taobao store, while Gao Hua-yin was in charge of contacting flower farmers in Kunming.
一间新手花店准备开业。
A novice florist is about to open.
只是他们都没有想到，这件事需要参与其中的人付出比预计多得多的精力。
It just didn't occur to them that it would take a lot more effort on the part of those involved.
11 日下午，确定昆明当地还能用顺丰发货之后，“买花救农”的链接在果果闲置许久的淘宝店上架了。
On the afternoon of the 11th, it was confirmed that Kunming would be able to use Shunfeng shipping, "buy flowers to save farmers" links in the fruit left idle for a long time on the Taobao store.
吴小忆自嘲说，自己莫名其妙就成了“卖花阿姨”，赶紧在群里吆喝大家来买花。
Wu Xiaoyi said that he had become "Auntie Flower" inexplicably, hurriedly yelled at everyone in the group to buy flowers.
吴小忆和果果做客服，负责导出订单，高华溢则在云南负责供应链。
Wu Xiaoyi and fruit as customer service, in charge of export orders, Gao Hua Ying in Yunnan in charge of the supply chain.
高华溢通过关系找到了其中一位花农郑武进，对方负责联络一批花农，每天将订单数量给到花农，次日清晨花农从地里采摘鲜花，再运到昆明打包、寄出。
Gao Hua-yin through the relationship to find one of the flower farmers Zheng Wujin, the other side in charge of contact with a number of flower farmers, daily orders to the number of flower farmers, the next morning the flower farmers picked flowers from the field, and then shipped to Kunming packaging, sent.
花农不认转账，只认现金。
Flower farmers do not transfer funds, only cash recognition.
在第一批订单到达之前，郑武进自己垫付了前期付给花农的货款和物流费用。
Before the first orders arrived, Zheng Wujin made advance payments to flower growers for their goods and logistics.
郑武进对接的花农来自云南楚雄州的两个镇，那里的鲜花种植面积大概有 2 万亩，疫情发生之后，大批鲜花滞销。
Zheng Wujin docked with flower farmers from two towns in Chuxiong, Yunnan, where the area of flower cultivation is about 20,000 mu, after the outbreak of large numbers of flowers unsold.
许多花农为化肥和花苗等前期投入已举债不菲，错过新春这个鲜花交易季，刚刚脱贫的花农们很可能会因债返贫。
Many flower farmers are already heavily indebted for early inputs such as fertilizers and flower seedlings, and are likely to fall back into poverty as they miss the new spring, the flower-trading season.
最终寄到消费者手上的玫瑰品种是卡罗拉，只有 A 级的花能够走出大山，销售出来，A 级品质以下的玫瑰，目前仍然处于被花农就地销毁的状态。
The rose variety that ended up in the hands of consumers was Karola, and only A-grade flowers were sold out of the mountains. Roses below A quality are still being destroyed in situ by flower farmers.
一位在一线城市的花店经营者告诉我们，这样的玫瑰视季节不同，零售价在 8-15 元之间。
A florist in a first-tier city told us that such roses retail at between $8 and $15, depending on the season.
△热心买家发来的买家秀在花店上架的这些玫瑰，最终定价是 66 元 36+4 支，其中 +4 的这几支，是物流损耗备用，如果消费者收到的花有超过 4 支破损，客服会跟进赔偿。
These roses, which were on display at the florist's shop, were finally priced at 66 yuan 36 + 4, of which + 4 were spare parts for logistics outlay. If the customer received more than 4 broken flowers, the customer service would follow up with compensation.
“我们的初衷是帮花农打开销路，运营和物流的成本只是粗略计算，究竟会亏多少，可能得过阵子才能算出来。
"Our intention was to help florists open up a market, and the cost of operations and logistics is only a rough calculation of how much will be lost," he said.
”录单、分拣、包装、物流，这一道道都是他们此前都不熟悉的环节。
Recording, sorting, packing, logistics, all of which they had been unfamiliar with before.
尽管多年之前开过淘宝店，现在的淘宝后台对吴小忆来说无疑是陌生的，每天，团队都需要把批量订单信息生成表格，发到昆明，等快递公司回传单号以后，再一个一个手动输入到淘宝后台。
Although the Taobao store opened many years ago, now Taobao backstage for Wu Xiaoyi is no doubt unfamiliar, every day, the team need to bulk order information to generate a form, sent to Kunming, express company return flyer numbers, and then a manual input to Taobao backstage.
前期的八百个订单都是这样慢慢摸索着完成，直到两位拥有电商经验的伙伴带着设备，加入这个临时组成的团队。
The first 800 orders were groped slowly, until two partners with experience in electronics joined the makeshift team with equipment.
花店的运转效率开始提高。
The efficiency of flower shops began to improve.
因为各地交通管制的原因，物流的情况经常变化，有的前一天能发货的地区，第二天就发不了，也只能联系顾客退单。
Because of traffic control everywhere, the logistics situation often changes, some can be delivered the day before, the next day can not be issued, can only contact customers to return the documents.
有一天，后台出现了一个来自昆明的订单，那位顾客留言说不用发货，说：“我住在呈贡，就是斗南花卉在的那里，每天我们办公室楼下都有好多花农送来的花，不要钱，随便拿，这次花农损失太大了，买这个也是想着能帮帮他们，真的不用发货给我了！”吴小忆拒绝了这种实质上是现金捐助的订单，因为任何一点让事情变复杂的情况，都是临时花店承受不起的。
I live in Chenggong, where Du Nan flowers are located. Everyday there are many flowers sent by the flower growers in our office and downstairs. Every day there are many flowers from the gardener.
△ 花田里刚摘下的玫瑰一位团队素不相识的博主@PetitChou小周自己买了花，自发帮忙发到微博上安利。
A newly picked rose in the flower field An unknown blogger @ Petit Chou bought flowers of his own accord and sent them to Amway on Weibo.
当天，小周那条 107 字的微博被转发超过一万次，人们都去淘宝上搜索“买花救农”，找到这家花店下单。
On the same day, Xiao Zhou's 107-word microblog was forwarded more than 10,000 times. People searched for "flowers to save farmers" and found the florist to place an order.
花店的小伙伴们对着爆单的后台傻眼了。
The little buddies in the florist shop look silly in the background.
被快速涌入的订单砸晕了的团队不得不暂时将商品下架，但是高华溢在昆明获得的反馈是，花农当天已经采摘了一万扎鲜花，等待售卖。
The team, stunned by the rapid influx of orders, had to pull the goods off shelves for a while, but feedback from Gao received in Kunming was that the growers had picked 10, 000 flowers for sale that day.
而另一边在微博上，小周面对众多质疑和评论，只能一遍遍解释，请大家耐心等待。
On the other side of Weibo, Xiao Zhou faces many questions and comments, which can only be explained over and over again. Please be patient and wait.
确认好物流、商品重新上架，花店又运转了起来。
To confirm good logistics, goods re-shelf, florist shop has been running again.
已经收到花的消费者，则在微博上和微信群里，发来了买家秀照片。
Consumers, who have received flowers, have sent in buyers' shows on microblogs and in micro-mail groups.
△买家秀花店开业到现在，刚好一周，团队的几位成员在这之前基本上都是朋友圈之交。
Buyers show florist shop now, just a week, several members of the team before this is basically a friend of the circle.
吴小忆和高华溢是猫友，和果果则是在抗疫志愿者的群里认识。
Wu Xiaoyi and Gao Hua-yin are cat friends, and fruit and fruit are known in the group of anti-epidemic volunteers.
从爆单那天的 8000 多单（因为物流限制，当日实际成交 7000 单），到现在每天平均 2000 多单的销量，这间临时花店的销量对于云南当地滞销的鲜花来说，仍然只是“九牛一毛”。
From more than 8,000 orders on the day of the blast (7,000 actually sold on the day because of logistics restrictions) to an average of more than 2,000 a day, sales at this makeshift florist are still "a drop in the ocean" for unsold flowers in Yunnan.
“我们现在就是尽一切努力多卖。
"We are making every effort to sell more now.
”吴小忆没有计划这件事会持续做到什么时候，只是想，如果进展顺利，可以再压缩中间环节，给花农争取更好的价格。
Wu did not plan when it would last, but thought that if things went well, the middle could be compressed to give growers a better price.
情人节深夜，处理完当天的订单，吴小忆在朋友圈写下一句：“时代的一粒灰，落在个人头上，就是一座山。
Late on Valentine's Day, after processing the order of the day, Wu Xiaoyi wrote in the circle of friends: "A gray of the times, landed on a personal head, is a mountain.
而我们想做的，无非是拉起手来用爱和善意试着托起这座沉重大山。
And all we want to do is pull our hands together and try to lift this heavy mountain with love and goodwill.
”△买家秀疫情对各个行业的影响正一点一点展现出来，从对一线医护人员的物资捐助，到如今各大电商平台推出的助农项目，这一个个由普通人撑起的善意，也给每一个普通的你我力量，撑起最近这段日子里日复一日的失望、愤怒与无能为力。
From material contributions to front-line health care workers to farmer-support programs offered by electric business platforms, the goodwill of the common people has also given each of us the strength to sustain the day-to-day disappointment, anger and impotence of these days.
希望更好的事情会发生。
I hope something better will happen.
友人评价买花救农的这个临时团队炽热又敏感，吴小忆说，她最喜欢的是加缪的那一句：“在隆冬，我终于知道自己身上有一个不可战胜的夏天。
Wu said her favourite sentence was Camus's: "In the depths of winter, I finally knew that I had an invincible summer.
”互动时间越多越多人物理复工了，说说你的复工生活吧，我从留言中选三位，分别送一份助农鲜花😉。
The more time you spend interacting with each other, the more people get back to work. Tell me about your return to work.
