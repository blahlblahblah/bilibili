“今天是开学的第一课，但是今天好特殊啊，说是第一课，我也不能在教室里给大家上课，我是复旦大学医学院的老师。
Today is the first lesson of the school year, but today is a special day. I can't give classes in the classroom, I am a teacher of Fudan University Medical School.
”开课后，张文宏和大家这样打招呼。
"Zhang Wenhong greeted everyone after the class began.
他称，自己是“百忙之中跑到这里来”录制课程，“你肯定觉得奇怪，怎么还有百忙之中跑过来的人呢，大家都闲得发慌对不对？我就是那个忙得不得了的人，因为我们是医生。
"You must be wondering why there are people running around in a hurry, right? I'm the busy man because we're doctors," he said.
”“ 不是你一个人的事情最近，张文宏对开工的人们说，“防火防盗防同事”，面对同学们，他仍以一贯的语气说道，“一旦开学过来后，你就知道我又要你做什么，你把这几件事做好，啥事都没有，如果做不好，可不是你一个人的事情噢，所有的同学全部会受影响。
"You're not alone," Zhang told people at work recently. "Fire-proof and anti-theft colleagues," he said to his classmates. "Once school starts, you know what I want you to do, you do all these things well, and if you don't do them well, you're not alone.
”“ 拜托大家戴口罩课程开播后，张文宏全程戴着口罩讲课，他说：“我讲课为什么戴口罩？我给你做示范呢。
"After the mask class started, Zhang said," Why am I wearing a mask when I lecture? I'll show you how.
在这个特殊的日子，我拜托大家最好是戴口罩。
On this special day, I beg you all to wear masks.
”“ 万一得病有什么症状？张文宏说，轻症中，发烧是最常见的症状，还有咳嗽、喉咙痛、胸闷、没力气等症状。
'In light cases, fever is the most common symptom, as well as cough, sore throat, tightness in the chest and lethargy, 'says Zhang.
此外，有些病人会恶心呕吐，腹泻、眼睛发红、肌肉酸痛，就像感冒一样的症状。
In addition, some patients will nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, red eyes, sore muscles, like cold symptoms.
而非常严重的，则是肺炎。
And very serious, it's pneumonia.
危重症多是老年人、有基础疾病者及肥胖者。
The most critical cases are the elderly, people with basic diseases and obese people.
“年轻人感染后没这么重，但肺炎本身就是很严重的，气就透不过来了。
"Young people are not so badly infected, but pneumonia itself is so serious that they can't breathe.
”“ 语言少了，思想就出来了战役打到一半，谁都有被感染的风险，那怎么办？“我们到了一个新的层次，在上海，我们控制得非常好，感染率很低。
"When words are scarce, ideas come out in the middle of a battle, and everyone is at risk of getting infected?" "We have reached a new level, in Shanghai, where we have very good control and a very low infection rate.
”张文宏再提“闷一闷”，他建议，学生在家的时候闷一闷，到学校的时候，再闷一闷，闷两个礼拜，再上上网络的课程。
Zhang Wenhong mentioned "stuffy" again, he suggested, students at home when stuffy, to school, again stuffy, stuffy two weeks, and then on the network of courses.
“两个星期一过，你没有生病，我告诉你，恭喜你，你真的没有生病。
'Two Mondays passed, and you weren't ill, I tell you. Congratulations, you really weren't ill.
”学生在寝室该如何做？张文宏说：“大家只要闷两个星期，少说话，你知道伐，语言少了，思想就出来了。
Zhang Wenhong said: "People just stay in the dorm for two weeks and talk less. You know cutting down the language and thinking comes out.
所以，闷两个星期对广大的大学生，是很好的锻炼噢。
So, stuffy two weeks to the vast number of college students, is very good exercise.
”他还提醒学生做两件事：第一点，回到上海以后，在寝室里老老实实地，不要窜来窜去；第二点，多一个人待着。
He reminded the students to do two things: first, to return to Shanghai, to be honest in the dormitory, not to darken up and down; and second, to stay alone.
“如果是寝室里两个人待着，也没事，东西分分开，戴戴口罩可以吧？吃饭的时候，不要聚在一起吃，自己吃自己的可以吧？”他对同学说：“你不是医生，但是你做的事情，比医生还重要。
"If it's just two people in the dorm, it's OK to split things up and wear masks? Don't get together to eat while you eat, can you?" He told his classmate, "You're not a doctor, but what you do is more important than a doctor.
”他还强调说：“一个疾病的控制从来不是医生把它控制住，而是我们采取了非常有效的预防策略。
"The control of a disease is never controlled by a doctor, but by a very effective prevention strategy," he said.
”课程最后，以张文宏手书寄语“冬将尽，春可期，山河无恙，人间皆安”结尾。
"At the end of the course, Zhang Wenhong wrote in calligraphy:" Winter is over, spring is over, the mountains and rivers are intact and the world is safe. "
