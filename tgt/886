本报记者 晏国文 曹学平 北京报道“护士不好当，急诊的护士更不好当，武汉的急诊护士更加不好当。
Yan Guo Wen Cao Xueping reported in Beijing: "Nurses are bad, emergency nurses are worse, Wuhan emergency nurses are even worse.
都是拿命在干，真害怕有一天忽然倒下。
It's all a matter of life. I'm afraid I'll fall down one day.
”1月16日凌晨3﹕20，武汉一大型三甲医院急诊科护士晓嘉（应被采访者要求为化名）在自己的微博上写下这段文字。
At 3: 20 a.m. on January 16, Xiaodja, an emergency nurse at a large three-A hospital in Wuhan, wrote the phrase on her microblog at the request of the interviewee.
几天之后，武汉新型冠状病毒疫情蔓延，被感染的患者数量突增。
A few days later, Wuhan new coronavirus epidemic spread, the number of infected patients suddenly increased.
晓嘉作为一名急诊科的护士，也没有幸免。
Xiaojia, as a nurse in the emergency department, was not spared.
1月23日，晓嘉写道：“大家好，我没有任何症状，但是今天查CT，不幸被查出了那个可怕的肺炎。
On January 23, Xiaojia wrote: "Hello, everyone, I don't have any symptoms, but today I checked the CT and was unfortunately found out that terrible pneumonia.
”晓嘉今年25岁，但是她的粉丝都称她为小姐姐。
"Xiaojia is 25, but her fans call her a little sister.
晓嘉以一位年轻的医务工作者和一名患者的身份，与网友交流患病与治疗情况，并且科普一些健康防护的常识。
Xiaojiajie as a young medical worker and a patient, with the netizens to share the disease and treatment, and some common knowledge of health protection.
1月25日，作为曾深入新型冠状病毒疫情防控一线并不幸被感染的真实个体，晓嘉告诉《中国经营报》记者，自己科室的护士同事被确诊感染新型冠状病毒之后，自己经过检查也发现呈冠状病毒阳性。
On January 25, as a real person who had been deeply involved in the prevention and control of the new coronavirus and was unfortunately infected, Xiaojia told China Business News that her colleagues in the department of nurses were diagnosed with the new coronavirus and found themselves tested positive for coronavirus.
因为病灶较小，病情较轻，医生建议晓嘉居家隔离治疗，开了莲花清瘟胶囊、盐酸阿比多尔片、盐酸莫西沙星片、磷酸奥司他韦胶囊等4种药品。
Because the lesion is small and the condition is mild, the doctor recommends that Xiaojia be treated in isolation with four medicines: Lotus rinderpest capsules, Abidol hydrochloride tablets, moxifloxacin hydrochloride tablets and oseltamivir phosphate capsules.
另外，晓嘉还需要定期去复查。
In addition, Xiaojia needs to be reviewed regularly.
因为疫情初期并没有得到足够的重视，晓嘉所在科室较晚才开始全员穿上防护服。
Because the epidemic did not get enough attention at the beginning of the epidemic, Xiaojia's department began to wear protective clothing at a late date.
晓嘉认为，或许就是在与患者的接触过程中自己染上了疾病。
Xiaojia believes that it may be in contact with patients in the course of their own illness.
这个春节，晓嘉没有回老家，而是留在武汉自己独居的公寓宿舍内。
This Spring Festival, Xiaojia did not return home, but to stay in Wuhan alone in his own apartment dormitory.
因为不想让家人担心，晓嘉自始至终都没有将被感染的事情告诉自己的家人。
Not wanting to worry her family, Xiaojia never told her family about the infection.
“我们科室太忙了，原本就回不去，并且现在已经‘封城’了。
"Our department is too busy to go back to the original, and now 'closed the city'.
跟他们说了他们还担心，所以就不说。
I told them they were worried, so I won't tell them.
”晓嘉说道。
"said Xiaojia.
1月24日，农历除夕，原本该与家人团聚的晓嘉继续在自己的隔离治疗中。
On January 24, Lunar New Year's Eve, Xiaojia, who was supposed to be reunited with her family, continued her isolation treatment.
晓嘉在自己的微博中写道：“昨晚半夜我的咽拭子核酸检测结果显示冠状病毒阳性。
"At midnight last night, my pharyngeal swab tested positive for coronavirus," Xiaojia wrote in her microblog.
算是确诊，今早去找了科室医生，由于我的病变范围较小，到目前为止没什么临床症状，建议我居家隔离，避免住院交叉感染，吃口服药，多喝开水。
To be sure, I went to my doctor this morning. As my lesion is small, so far there are no clinical symptoms. I suggest that I stay at home, avoid cross-infection in hospital, take oral medicine, drink more water.
网友说得很对，一个乐观的心态很重要，我一定可以战胜病毒的。
The netizen says very right, an optimistic state of mind is very important, I certainly can defeat the virus.
今天虽然是年三十，但病毒不放假，防护这件事不能掉以轻心。
Although today is 30 years old, but the virus does not have a holiday, the matter of protection can not be taken lightly.
过完年后，春天可能就不远了……因为这个事，生活和微博上有好多人给我加油关心，我的心很暖，消极失落想想这些心情（情绪）一下子就好了（没了）。
After the end of the year, spring may not be far behind... because of this, life and micro-blog a lot of people to cheer me care, my heart is very warm, negative lost think about these feelings (mood) in a hurry (no).
国难当前，同舟共济。
We are in this together.
一起加油！”图片来源：受访者供图以下是晓嘉的部分自述：我现在已经不在医院了。
Photo: Interviewee: below is a partial self-report by Xiaojia: I am no longer in the hospital.
因为我的病情比较轻，医生建议我在家隔离。
The doctor advised me to stay at home because I was in a mild condition.
过年期间，门诊没了，但是急诊科照常开。
The clinic was out during the New Year, but the emergency department was open as usual.
因此急诊科过年期间一般都很忙，所以就没有专门的排休息时间。
Therefore, the emergency department is usually very busy during the New Year, so there is no special rehearsal break.
如果想回家的话可以和别人换班。
You can change shifts if you want to go home.
换班之后会有两三天的休息时间。
There will be two or three days off after the shift.
我们科室太忙了，原本就回不去，并且现在已经“封城”了。
Our department is too busy to go back to the original, and has now "closed the city."
跟他们说了他们还担心，所以就不说。
I told them they were worried, so I won't tell them.
我现在还在隔离期，还要按时吃药，定期去复查。
I'm still in quarantine, and I have to take regular medication and have it reviewed regularly.
我没有什么症状。
I don't have any symptoms.
因为当时，我们科室收到了一些病人，接触比较多。
Because at that time, our department received some patients, contact more.
我们老师（比我年资更高的护士同事）有人感觉不舒服，查到确实得了这个病。
One of our teachers, a nurse colleague older than I was, felt sick and found out that he had the disease.
然后我们自己也查，感觉这样放心一点。
Then we'll check it out for ourselves and feel better about it.
但是一查发现，自己也被感染了。
But I found out that I was infected.
先查CT，发现有点问题，病变就像权威资料描述的那样，然后又查了鼻咽拭子，结果呈阳性。
Check the CT first, there's something wrong with the lesion, as the authorities describe, and then check the nasopharyngeal swab, and it turns out to be positive.
如果我们发现患者检测结果有问题的话，就会更加注意。
If we find a problem with the patient's test results, we pay more attention to it.
病人如果病情比较重的话就直接转到重症监护室了，不是很严重的就在我们这边治疗。
If the patient is more serious then direct to the intensive care unit, not very serious on our side of the treatment.
医院医护人员最近一周开始都要穿上防护服。
Hospital staff have been wearing protective clothing since the last week.
防护服穿得比较晚。
The protective clothing was worn late.
为什么我会得这个病，因为我们这边有一些高度疑似，但是还没有确诊的病人，会在我们这边待着。
Why do I get this disease, because we have a number of highly suspected, but not yet confirmed patients, will stay with us.
我们也会防护，但是刚开始的时候，那种病人数量还算少数，我们没有那么高度地重视。
We will defend ourselves, but at the beginning, the number of patients was small, and we didn't attach that much importance to it.
可能那时候不小心就被传染了。
Maybe I was accidentally infected at the time.
确诊之后，医生说我的病灶比较小，居家隔离更适合我，因为我住处也没有其他人，因此就在家里隔离治疗。
After the diagnosis, the doctor said my lesion was small and that the isolation was better for me, as there was no one else in my house, so I was isolated at home.
治疗费用不用自费。
Treatment is free of charge.
我觉得，我平时也是个爱运动的人，自认为抵抗力是比较强的。
I think, I am also a sports-loving people, think the resistance is relatively strong.
最近一段自己的特殊时期，自己特别注意按时用餐，按时作息，不能着凉感冒。
Recently a special period of their own, pay special attention to eat on time, regular sleep, can not catch a cold.
但是我也很纳闷，怎么就被传染了。
But I also wonder how I got infected.
因为最初没有确诊，我们也不知道进来的病人是不是新型冠状病毒的患者，我们的防护手段还是像接待普通病人的防护手段一样，所以就有很大的风险。
Since there was no initial diagnosis, we do not know whether the patient who came in was a patient with a new coronavirus, and our means of protection were the same as those used to protect ordinary patients, so there was a great deal of risk.
那时候没有穿防护服，就相当于赤手空拳在战斗。
Not wearing protective clothing at that time was tantamount to fighting with bare hands.
全副武装戴护目镜穿上厚重安全的防护服，是最近这一周才开始的。
Wearing heavily armed goggles and heavy safety suits has only begun this week.
防护服是连体的，包括帽子、鞋套都是连在一起的。
The protective clothing is connected, including the hat, the shoe cover are all connected together.
衣服前面是一个拉链，会粘在一起，如果再打开的话，就不粘了。
The front of the garment is a zipper that sticks together. If you open it again, it won't stick.
所以，我们穿这个防护服没有办法上厕所，并且口罩戴得特别严，并且还有护目镜压着鼻子。
So we can't go to the toilet in this suit, and the mask is very tight, and we have goggles pressing against our noses.
有的老师（护士）鼻子都被护目镜压红了。
Some teachers (nurses) have their noses red with goggles.
因为防护服是一次性的，现在这些物资是比较缺乏的，一天一套。
Because the protective clothing is disposable, now these materials are relatively scarce, one set a day.
中午吃饭的时候，也可以换下来，下午继续穿。
At lunch time, can also change off, continue to wear in the afternoon.
因为医院有暖气的。
Because the hospital has heating.
穿这么厚重封闭的防护服，身上往往都是汗水。
Wearing such heavy and closed protective clothing, the body is often full of sweat.
护目镜里全都是水雾，有时候都看不清东西。
The goggles were full of fog and sometimes I couldn't see clearly.
身上会感觉很热。
You'll feel hot on your body.
我觉得现在有两个问题：第一，物资方面，口罩、防护服等用品应该是比较短缺的，因为人太多，使用量太大了。
I think there are two problems now. First, there should be a shortage of masks, protective clothing and so on, because there are too many people and too much use.
另外，物资配送过程可能也是难题。
In addition, the material distribution process can be a challenge.
微博上有人说想寄些东西到我们医院，如果要寄的话，需要有医院的证明，因为武汉现在“封城”了，一般人也不让进。
On Weibo, people said they wanted to send something to our hospital. If they wanted to send it, they needed a hospital certificate because Wuhan was now "closed" and people were not allowed in.
第二，现在大家对病情有点疑病的感觉。
Second, now we are a little suspicious of the disease feeling.
部分来医院的人不一定真有事，但是非要到医院来检查。
Some people who come to the hospital may not be really busy, but they must come to the hospital to check.
恐慌的心理作用下，本来可能没有事情，最终造成医院门诊量增加。
The psychological effects of panic, which might not have been the case, eventually led to an increase in hospital outpatient visits.
这对他自身也不好。
It's not good for him either.
医院情况比较复杂，患病人数较多，在目前这种情况下，不能随便去医院。
Hospital conditions are more complex, the number of patients more, in the current circumstances, can not go to the hospital.
现在，我只希望多一些技术手段，诊断疾病。
Right now, I just want more technology to diagnose the disease.
患者确诊后，积极治疗，早日康复。
After the patient is diagnosed, active treatment, early recovery.
让我很感动一点是，很多不相识的人送了很多鲜花、食物到医院。
I am very touched that a lot of people do not know the flowers, food to the hospital.
但是他们并不是武汉人，大都是外地人，匿名送过来。
But they are not Wuhan people, mostly foreigners, sent anonymously.
作为一名护士，这些陌生人的小举动我挺感动，感觉暖心，让人感觉不是一个人在战斗。
As a nurse, I was moved and warm by the little actions of these strangers, and it made me feel like I wasn't fighting alone.
