因此，一款疫苗仍很有可能对多种亚型的病毒起效。
Therefore, a vaccine is still likely to be effective against a variety of subtypes of viruses.
”在全球科学界争分夺秒与新冠病毒“赛跑”的过程中，新的挑战正在不断出现。
New challenges are emerging as the global scientific community races against the new crown virus.
近日，已有多国学者指出，新冠病毒正在发生变异，这或将影响到诊断工具、药物和疫苗的研发。
Recently, many scholars have pointed out that the new crown virus is mutating, which may affect the development of diagnostic tools, drugs and vaccines.
但也有专家表示，目前病毒还未出现明显变异，仅发生了在RNA病毒身上常见的“小突变”，同样的疫苗仍很有可能对多种亚型的病毒起效，不必过于恐慌。
But other experts say the virus has yet to mutate significantly, with only the "minor mutations" common in RNA viruses, and that the same vaccine is likely to work on multiple subtypes of viruses without too much panic.
多国发现“突变点”3月3日，中国科学院主办的《国家科学评论》发表《关于SARS-CoV-2的起源和持续进化》一文。
"Mutations": The Origin and Continuous Evolution of SARS-CoV-2 was published in the March 3 issue of the China Academy of Sciences-sponsored National Science Review.
文章通过对迄今为止最大规模的103个新冠病毒全基因组分子进化分析发现，新冠病毒已于近期产生了149个突变点，并演化出了L和S两个亚型（注：SARS-CoV-2为此次疫情中的新型冠状病毒，COVID-19为感染病毒导致的新冠肺炎）。
Based on an analysis of the genome-wide molecular evolution of the largest 103 new-crown viruses to date, it has recently produced 149 mutation sites and evolved the L and S subtypes (note: SARS-CoV-2 is the new coronavirus and COVID-19 is the new coronavirus).
据界面新闻此前报道，文章作者发现，这两个亚型在地域分布以及人群中的占比相距甚远，推测其传播能力、致病严重程度可能存在较大区别。
The authors found that the two subtypes vary widely in geographic distribution and population, and that there may be significant differences in transmission and severity, the Interface News reported earlier.
其中，S亚型与蝙蝠来源的冠状病毒在进化树上更接近，是相对更古老的版本，L亚型则相对年轻。
The S-subtype is closer to the bat-derived coronavirus, the older version, and the L-subtype is younger.
但从占比上看，L亚型（70%）比S亚型（30%）更为普遍，且L亚型病毒株比S亚型携带了相对较多的新生突变，推测其病毒传播能力更强、在人体内复制更快。
However, L subtypes (70 per cent) are more common than S subtypes (30 per cent), and L subvirus strains carry relatively more new mutations than S subtypes, suggesting that they are more capable of transmitting viruses and replicating faster in humans.
文章发现，绝大多处患者体内提取的病毒株表明，其只感染了L型或S型中的一个病毒亚型。
The paper found that the virus strain in most patients showed that it was infected with only one virus subtype in type L or S.
L亚型在武汉疫情爆发的早期阶段更为普遍，之后由于强力的人为干预，其发生频率在1月初后有所下降。
L-subtypes were more common in the early stages of the Wuhan outbreak and then declined in frequency after the beginning of January due to strong human intervention.
不过文章也指出，一位确诊前有过武汉旅行史的美国患者分离的病毒株，预示其可能发生了同时感染L型和S型病毒的情况，但目前还无法排除新突变型的可能性，仍需扩大样本量，以验证上述结论或推测。
However, the article also pointed out that a virus strain isolated from an American patient who had a history of travel to Wuhan prior to diagnosis foreshadowed the possibility of co-infection with both L-type and S-type viruses, but that the possibility of new mutations could not be ruled out.
与此类似，在巴西及英国科学家2月29日合作发表于病毒学网站Virologic.org的《南美洲首份新冠病毒报告》一文中，也提到了新冠病毒在传播过程中已出现变异。
Similarly, in the first South American report on the new crown virus, published February 29 by Brazilian and British scientists at Virologic.org, a virology website, the virus has mutated.
截至4日，巴西已累计确诊3例新冠肺炎病例，还有1例首次核酸检测呈阳性待复查，四人均有意大利旅行史。
As of April 4, Brazil has confirmed a cumulative 3 cases of new crown pneumonia, 1 case of positive first nucleic acid test pending review, all four with a history of Italian travel.
研究人员在采集了前2例确诊病例的病毒基因后发现，其中一人的病毒基因组与中国公布的“Hu-1参考菌株”相比有3个突变点。
Researchers who took the virus genes from the first two confirmed cases found three mutations in one of them compared to the published "Hu-1 reference strain" in China.
据巴西圣保罗研究基金会下属通讯社Agência FAPESP4日报道，文章作者之一、圣保罗大学热带医学研究所所长萨比诺（Ester Sabino）表示，这名患者的病毒基因与从德国患者身上提取的菌株更接近，另外一人的则与在英国发现的病毒更相似。
According to Agência FAPESP4, a news agency affiliated with the São Paulo Research Foundation in Brazil, Ester Sabino, co-author of the article and director of the Institute of Tropical Medicine at the University of São Paulo, said the virus gene was closer to the strain found in German patients and more similar to that found in the UK.
萨比诺说，从欧洲国家发生内部传播的层面上讲，这意味着新冠病毒所引发的流行病正在欧洲“逐渐成熟”。
Sabino said that from the point of view of internal transmission in European countries, this means that the new crown virus-induced epidemic is "coming of age" in Europe.
上述文章在3月3日的更新中也提及，由于从巴西确诊病例身上提取的病毒基因存在多个突变点，意大利北部所爆发的疫情可能是多次引入的结果，而非来自单一来源。
As mentioned in the March 3 update, the outbreak in northern Italy could be the result of multiple introductions, rather than a single source, due to multiple mutations in the virus genes extracted from confirmed cases in Brazil.
影响药物和疫苗研发？在澳大利亚，同样有研究人员指出，新冠病毒正在发生变异。
Influencing drug and vaccine development? In Australia, researchers have also pointed out that the canopy virus is mutating.
据《印度教徒报》3日报道，澳大利亚联邦科学与工业研究组织（CSIRO）的研究人员在分析了115条已公布的基因组序列后认为，病毒正在发生变异，或将给今后诊断工具、药物及疫苗的研发和试验带来显著影响。
Researchers from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), who analyzed 115 published genome sequences, said the virus was mutating or would have a significant impact on the development and testing of diagnostic tools, drugs and vaccines in the future.
武汉大学医学部病毒学研究所教授杨占秋4日也向《环球时报》表示，新冠病毒发生的突变，对疫苗设计和疫情诊断都具有很大意义，如果不同病例身上的病毒基因序列有别，那么同样的诊断工具和疫苗可能就无法起效，在设计上必须更加精准。
Yang Zhanqiu, professor of virology at Wuhan University's Department of Medicine, also told the Global Times Thursday that the mutations of the new crown virus are of great significance for vaccine design and diagnosis. If virus sequences are different in different cases, the same diagnostic tools and vaccines may not work and must be more precise in design.
此外，发生变异的新冠病毒在致病特点上也会有所不同。
In addition, mutations of the new crown virus may have different pathogenic characteristics.
杨占秋说，比如在中国的病毒的致死率是2%，在欧洲的病毒则可能会导致更高的死亡率。
In China, for example, the death rate of the virus is 2 percent, while in Europe the virus could cause a higher death rate, he said.
3月4日，香港还出现了一只宠物狗被检出新冠病毒弱阳性的案例。
On March 4, there was also a case of a dog being tested negative for the new crown virus.
香港渔农自然护理署（渔护署）当天表示，有关结果显示，该宠物狗已低程度感染有关病毒，很可能是由人类传染。
The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said on the same day that the results showed that the pet dog had been infected with the virus at a low level and was likely to be human-infected.
据悉，该宠物狗的主人此前就是新冠病毒感染者。
It is reported that the owner of the pet dog is the new crown virus infection.
不过，目前还未有证据显示，宠物会感染或传播新冠病毒，该宠物狗也没有任何相关病征，这提示病毒并未在狗身体中大量复制引发疾病。
However, there is no evidence that pets can infect or transmit the new canine virus, nor does the dog have any symptoms, suggesting that the virus does not replicate in large numbers in dogs.
突变不代表“进化”据了解，就其他冠状病毒而言，SARS-CoV曾发生突变，变得更易感染人类，MERS-CoV则未发生变异。
Mutations do not represent "evolution" It is understood that in the case of other coronavirus, SARS-CoV mutated and became more susceptible to human infection, while MERS-CoV did not mutate.
但要注意的是，新冠病毒发生变异，并不代表病毒已实现“进化”。
Note, however, that a variation on the new crown virus does not mean that the virus has evolved.
这首先是因为，相较于全球已有的新冠肺炎确诊病例人数来说，目前仅有130余条基因组序列被分析和上传，仍缺乏大规模的病毒基因序列分析，需要对更多样本以及患者的发病情况展开分析，才能得出更可靠的结论。
This is due, first of all, to the fact that only over 130 genome sequences have been analysed and uploaded compared to the number of confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia worldwide, that there is still a lack of large-scale genetic sequencing of the virus and that more diverse versions and patient profiles need to be analysed in order to draw more reliable conclusions.
此外，突变本来就是病毒生命周期的一个自然组成部分，像新冠病毒这样的单链RNA病毒，在自我复制的过程会更容易变异。
Moreover, mutations are a natural part of the virus's life cycle, and single-stranded RNA viruses, such as the new cap virus, become more susceptible to self-replication.
耶鲁大学及悉尼大学的研究人员在2月18日于《自然—微生物学》上刊发的一篇评论文章中指出，突变可使病毒毒性增强，也可使其减弱，而病毒的毒性和传播方式等是由多个基因控制，即需要多个突变才能进化，任何关于突变后果的说法都需要实验和流行病学证据，不应太过恐慌。
In a commentary published Feb. 18 in Nature Microbiology, researchers at Yale University and the University of Sydney argued that mutations can make viruses more or less toxic, while viral toxicity and modes of transmission are controlled by multiple genes, which require multiple mutations to evolve, and any claim about the consequences of mutations requires experimental and epidemiological evidence and should not be too panicked.
不过，从流行病防控方面考虑，病毒变异的可能性越大、速度越快，就越难防控，疫苗研发也会相对更难。
However, in terms of epidemiological considerations, the more likely and faster the virus mutates, the more difficult it will be to control it and the more difficult it will be to develop a vaccine.
以流感病毒为例，由于其病毒序列常常突变，疫苗制造商每年都要根据变种生产新的疫苗。
In the case of influenza viruses, vaccine manufacturers produce new vaccines each year based on variants, as their virus sequences often mutate.
对此，世卫组织此前主管传染病事务的助理总干事、现伦敦卫生与热带医学院（LSHTM）传染病流行病学教授大卫·海曼（David Heymann）表示，目前来看，新冠病毒仍相对稳定，仅出现了一些“小突变”，这意味着各国研发的疫苗仍有很大可能起效。
In response, David Heymann, WHO's former Assistant Director-General for Infectious Diseases and now Professor of Communicable Diseases Epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), said the new crown virus was still relatively stable, with only a few "minor mutations," meaning that vaccines developed in various countries still had a good chance of working.
此前，中国科学院西双版纳热带植物园、南方医科大学以及世卫组织新冠肺炎联合专家考察组均曾表示，新冠病毒尚未发现明显变异。
Previously, the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Southern Medical University and the WHO Joint Expert Study Group on New Crown Pneumonia had indicated that no significant variation of the new crown virus had been found.
全球共享禽流感数据倡议组织（GISAID）相关研究亦显示，新冠病毒的S蛋白在与人体ACE2蛋白结合的地方尚未发生突变，说明病毒的基本特性还没有改变。
Studies by the Global Shared Avian Influenza Data Initiative (GISAID) have also shown that the S protein of the new crown virus has not mutated where it binds to the human ACE2 protein, indicating that the basic properties of the virus have not changed.
海曼教授指出，研究人员在研发疫苗时，一般都以病毒“最持久（most sustained）”的部分为依据，因此，一款疫苗仍很有可能对多种亚型的新冠病毒起效。
Researchers typically base their vaccine development on the part of the virus that is "most persistent," so a vaccine is likely to work on multiple subtypes of the new crown virus, he said.
他补充说，“科学家如今仍在了解病毒，但就目前来看，其源头仍能追溯至湖北省最初出现的毒株”。
"Scientists still know about the virus, but for now, its source can be traced back to the original strain in Hubei province," he added.
