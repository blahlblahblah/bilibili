以意大利为圆心的欧洲几乎“沦陷”，中东地区及美国新增病例迅速增加，南美洲国家亦受到波及。
Italy-centric Europe has almost "fallen," with a rapid increase in new cases in the Middle East and the US, as well as in South American countries.
此前，谭德塞已经宣布，由于对新冠病毒的传播及其严重性，以及对（一些国家）不作为的震惊，WHO评估认为，新冠肺炎已具备“大流行”（pandemic）特征。
Earlier, Mr Tanner had announced that the new crown pneumonia had acquired the characteristics of a "pandemic" because of the spread of the virus and its severity, as well as shock at inaction.
所谓“大流行”意味着什么？据报道，升级为全球大流行病，表明新冠疫情已在全球范围内广泛传播，但这并不意味着新冠病毒已经变得更加致命了。
What does the so-called pandemic mean? The reported escalation to a global pandemic indicates that the new crown has spread globally, but that does not mean that the new crown virus has become more deadly.
谭德塞也表示，定义“大流行”不会改变世卫组织对其威胁的评估，“它不会改变世卫组织正在做的事情，也不会改变各国应该做的事情”。
Mr Tanner also said defining a "pandemic" would not change WHO's assessment of the threat, "it would not change what the WHO is doing, nor what countries should do."
谭德塞呼吁各国采取四管齐下的战略：至今未受病毒影响的地区继续在各方面做好准备；继续加强检测、预防和治疗工作；减少和抑制病毒传播；积极寻找新方法预防感染，分享各自积累的经验。
Tanner called on countries to adopt a four-pronged strategy: to continue to be prepared in areas hitherto unaffected by the virus; to continue to strengthen detection, prevention and treatment; to reduce and suppress the spread of the virus; and to actively seek new ways to prevent infection and share their accumulated experience.
担心家人和自己的健康，三年后回国自首鉴于全球疫情的暴发，日前，长期潜逃在国外的某走私案件犯罪嫌疑人致电上海海关缉私部门，称其要回国自首，并于2月底乘航班飞抵上海浦东国际机场入境。
A suspected smuggler who had absconded for a long time called Shanghai Customs anti-smuggling department to say he wanted to turn himself in and fly to Shanghai Pudong International Airport at the end of February.
记者从上海海关了解到，早在2017年8月，该嫌疑人就因涉嫌走私化妆品，被上海海关缉私部门立案侦查，案值达1500余万元。
Shanghai Customs learned that as early as August 2017, the suspect was suspected of smuggling cosmetics, the Shanghai Customs anti-smuggling department opened an investigation, the value of the case amounted to more than 15 million yuan.
案发时，她身在国外未到案。
At the time of the crime, she was not abroad.
立案后，缉私部门第一时间对其采取了边控及上网追逃措施，并多次规劝其回国接受调查，但其始终潜逃境外未归，而同案犯许某于2019年11月已经判决。
When the case was filed, the anti-smuggling department immediately adopted border control and on-line flight measures and repeatedly advised him to return to the country for investigation, but he always absconded outside the country, and the co-offender, Xu Mou, was sentenced in November 2019.
“一方面多年来一直在考虑回国自首，另一方面年初国内疫情和身处国疫情相继暴发，担心国内家人和今后自己在那里的健康安全，该嫌疑人最终选择了回国自首。
"On the one hand, he has been considering returning to China for many years, and on the other hand, he chose to surrender because of the outbreak of domestic epidemic and epidemic situation in China at the beginning of the year, fearing for the health and safety of his family and himself there.
”上海海关缉私部门的工作人员表示。
Shanghai Customs anti-smuggling department staff said.
2月底，该嫌疑人乘机抵达上海浦东国际机场。
At the end of February, the suspect arrived at Pudong International Airport in Shanghai.
鉴于近期新冠肺炎疫情在国外蔓延的严峻形势，上海海关缉私部门做好办案警员防护措施，第一时间前往浦东机场边检办理交接手续。
In view of the severe situation of the recent spread of the new crown pneumonia abroad, the anti-smuggling department of the Shanghai Customs took effective measures to protect the case officers and went to the Pudong Airport to handle the handover procedure at the first time.
目前，上海海关缉私部门已对其采取取保候审强制措施。
At present, the anti-smuggling department of Shanghai Customs has taken compulsory measures on bail.
该名嫌疑人在入境前，已接受卫生检疫措施，未发现发热等其他健康异常情况。
Before entering the country, the suspect had undergone sanitary and phytosanitary measures and no other health abnormalities such as fever had been found.
