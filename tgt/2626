一座看似静止的城市背后涌动着生命希望上午九点，钱志红准时走进自己的办公室，自武汉疫情爆发以来，他几乎没有停止过工作。
Life Surges Behind a seemingly static City Hope for 9 a.m. Qian Zhihong enters his office on time and has hardly stopped working since the outbreak of the epidemic in Wuhan.
将近一个月时间里，作为国美安迅物流湖北分公司的总经理，突如其来的援助任务要求他必须像钉子一样钉在武汉。
For nearly a month, as the general manager of Guomei An Xun Logistics Hubei branch, the unexpected assistance task required him to nail like a nail in Wuhan.
“武汉需要我们，取暖器、空调、冰箱、洗烘一体机这些物资都是一线急需的，我们不仅要送到，还要负责安装。
Wuhan needs us. The radiators, the air conditioners, the refrigerators, the washing machines are all in urgent need. We have to deliver them and install them
”已经连续加班多日的钱志红，声音略显沙哑。
Qian Zhihong, who has worked overtime for days on end, has a slightly husky voice.
但谈及这段时间的援助工作，也难掩兴奋，目前他的重点工作是援建方舱医院。
But when it comes to aid work in this period, it's hard to be excited, and his priority now is to help build the Fang Cao Hospital.
“不止我们，还有很多企业也在现场，有的负责改造供水供电，有的负责安装床铺，我们的任务是空调、电视的运送安装。
"Not only we, but also a lot of enterprises, some responsible for water supply and power supply, some for the installation of beds, our task is air conditioning, television transport installation.
”△钱志红为武汉火神山医院运送国美捐赠物资由于现场基础设施不完备，国美送装工程师往往要从早上8点一直工作到晚上11点。
"Qian Zhihong sent Gome materials to Wuhan Fosen Mountain Hospital. Because of inadequate on-site infrastructure, Gome delivery engineers often work from 8am to 11pm.
谈及工作强度，钱志红笑了笑：“大家都在超负荷运转，没人喊累，现场看到还有很多和我们一样的人在工作，更有干劲儿了。
Talking about the intensity of the work, Qian Zhihong smiled: "Everyone is running over load, no one yells tired, there are many people like us at work, more motivated.
”与外界“武汉暂停”的感受不同，在钱志红眼里，看到的是一个个鲜活而丰满的个体，正是他们最大限度发挥了专业精神，才保证了武汉没有断水断电，人民基本生活依然有保障，甚至创造了大型医院瞬间拔地而起的奇迹。
Unlike outside Wuhan, where Qian Zhihong's eyes are filled with fresh and full-bodied individuals, it is their utmost professionalism that has ensured Wuhan has not cut off water and electricity, the people's basic livelihood is still guaranteed, and even created a major hospital of instant miracle.
疫情之下双面武汉钱志红第一次去医院执行配送安装任务，正值武汉疫情的爆发期，他们的任务是向医院配送一批洗烘一体机。
Wuhan Qian Zhihong under the outbreak of the first time to the hospital to carry out distribution installation tasks, just at the outbreak of Wuhan, their task is to distribute a batch of bake machine to the hospital.
临出发前，他要求参与这次配送的所有人做好防护工作。
Before leaving, he asked everyone involved in the distribution to do a good job of protection.
“基本都有家庭，这种情况下天天跟医院打交道，必须要做好准备。
"Basically there are families, and in this situation you have to be prepared to deal with hospitals on a daily basis.
”但即使这样，坐在安迅物流运输车上的钱志红，还是有些紧张。
But even so, Qian Zhihong, who sits on Anxun's logistics carrier, is nervous.
但当钱志红看到在医院门口焦急等待、全副武装的医护人员，他的疑虑瞬间被打消了。
But when Qian Zhihong saw the heavily armed paramedics waiting anxiously outside the hospital door, his doubts were instantly dispelled.
“他们比我们难，每天把自己裹在厚厚的防护服里还有很多病人要照顾，那可是直接接触患者啊。
"They're a lot harder than we are. They're wrapped up in thick protective clothing and there's a lot of patients to take care of.
”最让钱志红感动的还是来自医疗工作者的关心。
What moved Qian most was the concern of medical workers.
在一次配送安装任务中，因为设备安装是在隔离区进行，拆卸、搬运和安装的环节较为繁琐，钱志红和同事们在医院逗留了很长时间，临走前，医院扣留了他们的搬运手推车。
During a distribution installation, as the installation of the equipment was carried out in the area of separation, the dismantling, handling and installation of the equipment was cumbersome, and Qian Zhihong and his colleagues spent a long time in the hospital, which seized their carts before leaving.
“都进过隔离区，就别拿走了，等疫情过去了，记得来拿就行。
"Once you're inside the containment area, don't take it. When the outbreak is over, just come and get it.
”医院的对接人一边在本子上登记信息，一边对钱志红说。
"The hospital docking person side registers the information in the book, simultaneously says to Qian Zhihong.
“我们实际上是准备把手推车消完毒就带走的，但是为了我们的安全，那位医护人员还是把车留下来了，我想和他握个手，但是不能。
"We were actually going to take the cart away after it was finished, but for our safety the paramedics left it behind and I tried to shake hands with him, but I couldn't.
”△国美安迅物流黄一平到武昌医院疫区病房送冰箱，帮助重症患者储存丙种球蛋白药品“歇会吧，慢慢来，不着急”、“也没给你们准备水，特殊阶段，医院的东西不能让你们接触”、“回去可一定注意消毒”，这是钱志红在医院经常听见的话。
Huang Yiping sent refrigerators to the sick ward of Wuchang Hospital to help patients with severe diseases store gamma globulin drugs. "Take your time and not worry" and "No water for you.
疫情之前很少有人关注到这些细节，疫情之中，这些叮嘱，让钱志红感到很温暖。
Before the outbreak few people paid attention to these details, the outbreak, these instructions, let Qian Zhihong feel very warm.
“有些事儿，一定是要有人去做的，我觉得我的城市垮不了。
"There's something that someone has to do, and I don't think my city can go down.
武汉，九省通衢，我接触了很多一线的人，没有人退缩，大家都在相互鼓励，战斗在一起，我不在乎外界怎么看我们，我眼里的武汉并没什么两样。
Wuhan, which has thoroughfare of nine provinces, has communicated with many frontline people, and no one has flinched. Everybody encourages each other and fights each other.
”空无一人的街道，安迅物流的运输车正在行驶，红色条幅上写着“国美支援，武汉加油”如生命血液依然在武汉的血管里流淌。
"An empty street, the logistics of the transport car is driving, red banners say" Gome support, Wuhan refueling, "such as life blood is still flowing in the blood vessels of Wuhan.
堵车不复 白衣征战陈安娜做好车内消毒之后，将车缓缓驶向了武汉的城市主干道。
Traffic jams no longer white clothes Zhan Anna do a good job inside the car disinfection, will slowly drive to Wuhan's main urban road.
“封城”以来，全部公共交通工具停运。
Since the closure of the city, all public transport has been suspended.
在国美武汉分公司从事广宣工作的陈安娜白天是国美支援武汉的记录者，早晚开上私家车她就是接送医疗人员上下班的专属接驾司机。
Chen Ana, who works in the Wuhan branch of Gome, is a day-time record holder of Gome's support for Wuhan. She drives in her private car sooner or later.
“十七八公里，他们都是走路上下班，这个我真的特别心酸。
"Seventeen or eighteen kilometers, they all walk to and from work, and that really hurts me.
家远的有二三十公里，每天走路上班，你能想象吗？他们一天还要看一百多个病人，上了十几个小时的班，却只能在冬夜里步行几个小时回家。
Can you imagine walking to work twenty or thirty kilometers away from home and seeing more than a hundred patients a day for more than a dozen hours of work, only to walk home for a few hours on winter nights.
医生守护我们，我也要尽一份力守护他们。
The doctor guards us, and I will do my part to protect them.
”陈安娜加入了汉口私家车义工车队，这个车队里有200多名私家车主，自告奋勇，每天跨越13个城区，接送那些下班最晚、上班最早的白衣天使。
Chen joined a group of more than 200 private car owners who volunteered to cross 13 cities every day to pick up the oldest white-clad angels who worked late at work.
△陈安娜做志愿者接送医护人员陈安娜成为志愿者后，常常天不亮就要出发，半夜才能休息。
When Anna Chen volunteered to take medical staff to health care, she often had to leave before dawn and not be able to rest until midnight.
一路上，原本拥挤的马路不见了，除了依然站岗的路灯，整个城市空荡荡的。
Along the way, the originally crowded road disappeared, except for the street lights still standing guard, the whole city is empty.
她竟然开始回味从前堵车的日子，“真想再犯一次怒路症。
She started to think back to the days when there was a traffic jam.
”十分钟后到达指定医院，陈安娜凝望着奔波忙碌的医护人员，响着特有警笛的救护车，焦急守候的家属，“这基本就是武汉的现状，希望它快点好起来。
Ten minutes later, when she arrived at the designated hospital, Anna looked at the busy paramedics, the ambulance that was ringing its own siren, and the anxious family.
”在做志愿者的十多天中，陈安娜见到了不同的医护人员，他们大多数说起话来都是有气无力的，有的年纪轻轻，有的头发花白。
"During her more than 10 days as a volunteer, Anna met with a variety of medical professionals, most of whom spoke weakly, some young and some grey-haired.
即使隔着口罩，陈安娜也能感受到他们的疲劳。
Even through the mask, Anna could feel their fatigue.
还有的人一上车就睡着了，好几次，陈安娜还看到医护人员脸上红色的勒痕和布满血丝的眼睛……虽然全国的医疗物资和人员不断地涌向武汉，可在陈安娜看来，医护人员的工作压力依然很大，但即使这样，这些疲惫的人都不忘时刻履行自己的职责。
On several occasions, Anna also saw red strangulation marks and bloodstained eyes on the faces of medical staffs... Even though medical supplies and personnel continued to pour into Wuhan, according to Chen, the pressure on medical staff was still high, but even so, the weary ones never forgot to fulfill their duties.
“有的人下车前会问我还需不需要口罩，提醒我要注意防护，还有人硬是拿着消毒水把自己坐过的地方消完毒才肯走。
"Some people ask me if I need a mask before getting out of the car. They warn me to be on guard.
”“每天都是在心疼中度过的。
'Every day is spent in love.
”陈安娜说，为了不影响医护人员在车上休息，她总是把车开的平稳些再平稳些。
Chen says she always drives smoothly and smoothly so as not to interfere with the rest of the staff.
但是车上休息的医生和护士内心却无法平静，因为他们所面对的是没有硝烟的战场，那里有生命的危险，更有生命的希望。
But the rest of the doctors and nurses could not calm their hearts, for they were facing a battlefield without smoke, where there was danger to life and more hope for life.
“他们真的是义无反顾地在战斗，看到他们，我很踏实。
"They were really fighting," he said. "Seeing them, I was safe.
”陈安娜知道，在这场与疫情的场殊死搏斗中，“白衣天使就是拯救武汉的超级英雄。
Chen knew that in this deadly battle against the epidemic, "the angel of white is the superhero who saves Wuhan.
”英雄城市英雄的人应防控要求，武汉国美的门店已经全部关闭，但是因为城市水电持续供应，为了杜绝安全隐患，从除夕这天15:00闭店开始，武汉国美王家湾店的张晗与同事就承担起了门店消防检查的任务。
Wuhan Gome's stores have been closed in response to demands for control, but since the city's water and electricity supply continues, Zhang Han and colleagues at Wangjiawan's Wangjiawan in Wuhan have undertaken the task of checking the fire in the store since 15: 00 pm on New Year's Eve.
为了保证通勤，张晗请朋友骑电动自行车接送自己，每次他从武昌到汉阳，都要经过长江大桥，而这座双向八车道大桥已经不复往日的车水马龙，寂静的车道上，连一辆车、一个人都没有，只有风与张晗擦身而过。
Every time he travels from Wuchang to Hanyang, he must cross the Yangtze River Bridge. This two-way eight-lane bridge is no longer full of traffic.
生于斯长于斯的张晗，生平还是第一次见到这样悲凉的景象，“说不怕是假的，什么都不敢想，只想快一点赶到门店。
For the first time in his life, Zhang Han saw such a sad picture. "No fear is false, nothing dares to think, just to get to the store quickly.
”每到张晗轮岗，平时公交+地铁1小时的单程上班路，骑电动车却需要2小时。
Every time Zhang Han wheeled or wheeled, it took two hours for a one-way trip to work by bus + subway.
张晗说他是自己一个人住，这个春节还没回家见过父母，家人反对继续上班，但他还是执意上班。
Zhang Han says he lives alone. He hasn't come home to see his parents this Spring Festival.
“这是我的岗位，我有我的责任。
"This is my position, and it is my duty.
”下班回家，张晗要去超市购买一些生活必需品。
When he came home from work Zhang Han went to the supermarket to buy necessities.
在张晗看来，超市营业员更加忙碌，为避免人多聚集，进出超市的人数需要严格限制，超市内要防止扎堆购物，戴着口罩和手套的收银员还要疏导远距离排队。
In Zhang Han's view, supermarket salesmen are busier. To avoid crowds, the number of people going in and out of supermarkets needs to be strictly limited.
“每个人都还在努力的工作和生活，尤其是这些维持生活正常运转的人们，我觉得他们也是这个城市的英雄。
"Everyone is still working and living hard, especially the people who keep their lives running, and I think they are heroes in this city," he said.
”张晗说。
"said Zhang Han.
城市病了，但生活还要继续，疫情之下，每一个人都活成了英雄的样子。
The city is sick, but life will continue, under the epidemic, everyone has become a hero.
警察、社区工作者、公务员和党员奋战在抗疫一线，但更多的人被迫宅在家里。
Police, community workers, civil servants and party members are fighting the frontlines of the epidemic, but many more are forced to stay at home.
在一次一次推迟复工和开学时间后，在家办公、在家学习，是当下减少经济损失和学业损失的唯一办法。
Working from home and studying at home, after a one-time delay in starting work and school hours, is the only way to reduce economic and academic losses now.
一时之间，平板电脑、笔记本电脑成为畅销品。
For a while, tablets and laptops became best sellers.
2月以来，武汉国美徐东商城店店长蔡俊刚不断收到用户购买电子设备的需求。
Since February, Wuhan Gome Xu Dong Mall store manager Cai Jungang has continued to receive users to purchase electronic equipment.
“孩子上课急用”、“在家办公给推荐个高性价比笔记本”、“有没有能保护眼睛的平板？”每天他都会收到和回复这样的消息足有上百条。
There are hundreds of messages he receives and replies to every day: "Kids are in urgent need of class," "A cost-effective notebook is recommended for work at home," "Is there a tablet that protects your eyes?"
蔡俊刚紧急摸排了门店电子产品货存情况，并把所有品牌和产品功能梳理清楚，一一反馈给有需求的用户。
Cai Jungang emergency layout store electronic products, and all the brand and product functions clear, one by one feedback to users in need.
用两天的时间把用户需求处理好，蔡俊刚还要发消息约定好分批取货的时间，并千叮咛万嘱咐“请不要提前来，避免聚集”。
After two days to handle the user requirements, Cai Jungang has also spoken the time to pick up the goods in batches and has spoken the words "please do not come early and avoid gathering."
早上7点蔡俊刚就到达店里，先为门店里里外外进行全面消毒和通风，不留任何死角，随后把用户已经预定的产品按照取货的时间和顺序准备好，以便减少用户等待时间。
Cai Jungang arrived at the store at 7 a. m., disinfecting and ventilating the store inside and outside the store without leaving any dead ends. He then prepared the products the user had ordered at the time and in order to reduce the waiting time.
△为方便用户，蔡俊刚把商品亲自送到用户家“以前用户来买东西经常聊很久，现在拿了就走了，不敢逗留。
"For the convenience of users, Cai Jungang sent the goods to the user's home in person." Before, users used to chat a lot about things.
”白天忙碌完商品自提，晚上蔡俊刚还要跟踪社群营销进展，并为在家办公的销售人员解答各种问题。
Mr. Cai also tracks community marketing progress at night and answers questions for home-based salespeople.
“用户的生活需求还是很大，要通过在线的方式及时满足。
"Users' life needs are still very large and need to be met online in a timely manner.
”因为频繁的与外界接触，蔡俊刚和张晗一样，并不和家人住在一起，每天都是以视频的方式和妻子孩子“见面”。
Because of frequent contact with the outside world, Cai Jungang, like Zhang Han, does not live with his family.
每次下班，他都会看到武汉长江二桥“武汉加油”的字幕。
Every time off work, he will see Wuhan Yangtze River Erqiao "Wuhan refueling" subtitles.
自从疫情爆发以来，桥上用灯光打出的“武汉加油”，每晚一刻不停地闪耀在长江之上，从“武汉加油”“中国加油”到“武汉必胜”“中国必胜”，灯光照亮了江水，照入了人心，这是灯光，更是希望。
Since the outbreak of the outbreak, the bridge with the lights of "Wuhan refueling," every night on the Yangtze River, from "refueling" "China refueling" to "Wuhan Bisheng" "China will win," the lights lit up the river, shining into the hearts of the people, this is the lights, more hope.
