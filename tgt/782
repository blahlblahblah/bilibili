各地民间对“武汉人”的恐惧和谩骂不忍卒读，恐惧是远比病毒更凶猛的疾病。
Local folk "Wuhan people" fear and abuse can not bear apoplexy, fear is far more ferocious disease than the virus.
口述 | 黄　政整理 |金　姬我是武汉人，毕业来上海已经十多年，在上海落户安家也已七年。
I am from Wuhan. I have been in Shanghai for more than 10 years, and it has been seven years since I settled down.
因为我和妻子工作较忙，去年夏季开始我父母便从武汉来沪帮忙带小孩。
Since my wife and I were busy working, my parents came to Shanghai from Wuhan last summer to help take care of the children.
今年1月，父母带着小孩在武汉待了8天母亲原为公职人员，四年前已退休，但退休干部党团活动仍不落下，今年1月初原单位通知组织学习会议，父母决定暂时返汉一周参加学习顺便处理些杂务。
After eight days in Wuhan in January, my mother, a former civil servant, retired four years ago. But the activities of the Party committee of retired cadres remained unchanged. In early January, parents decided to temporarily return to China for a week to study and take care of some errands.
此时虽然武汉传来肺炎的消息，但新闻很快辟谣，作为多年党员，父母自然也没特别在意。
At this time, although Wuhan news of pneumonia, but the news quickly refuted, as a party member for many years, parents naturally do not care.
我虽有顾虑，但多年在汉生活，对于武汉的科研及医疗水平有相当信心，劝阻无果后只能叮嘱注意防护。
Although I have misgivings, but many years of life in Han, Wuhan scientific research and medical standards have been quite confident, dissuaded from fruitless can only be ordered to pay attention to protection.
父母带着小孩于1月13日抵汉，办完事后便准备返沪。
The parents and children arrived in China on January 13 and were ready to return to Shanghai after finishing the project.
1月20日新闻爆出情势急转，21日下午父母和小孩回到上海，此时在武汉的同学和朋友的朋友圈还是一片乐观。
When news broke out on January 20th and parents and children returned to Shanghai on the afternoon of January 21, students and friends in Wuhan were optimistic.
返家后，父母表示大家目前身体都无异样，且全程戴口罩，但仍打算自我隔离一周，以防万一。
On their way home, the parents said they were all healthy and wearing masks for the entire trip, but planned to remain isolated for a week as a precaution.
我们家虽无二套房，但至少还有独立房间可供单独生活。
We don't have two suites, but at least we have separate rooms for living alone.
我根据校友群转发的隔离指南叮嘱父母不要出门，网购备下日常用品，我和妻子则准备早出晚归，避免接触，度过了假期前最后2个工作日。
I instructed my parents not to go out and get supplies online. My wife and I prepared to leave early and stay out late, avoiding contact for the last two working days before the holiday.
1月23日早上起来，看到武汉封城的消息，气氛骤然紧张，新闻爆出的信息十分严峻，除向父母叮嘱隔离事宜外，我和妻子也开始思考后续的问题。
When I got up on the morning of January 23 and saw the news of the Wuhan Sealing City, the atmosphere suddenly tense, the news leaked a very severe message, in addition to parents to order the separation matter, my wife and I also began to think about follow-up issues.
首要问题是物资储备，临近春节，物流本来就不畅，之前定的防护用品都还在路上，清点家里消毒液、口罩、一次性手套尚有一些，可短时间支撑，重点是食物储备。
The first problem is the material reserves, the Spring Festival approaching, logistics is not smooth, the previous set of protective equipment are still on the road, inventory of disinfectant, masks, disposable gloves there are still some, can support for a short time, the focus is on food reserves.
我和妻子迅速分工，在盒马、京东、饿了么上面订购各种物品，米、面、油、青菜、肉、蛋、冷冻食品、罐头，还有岳父母家的份额，经过一早上的奋战，看着“商家备货”的字样稍微安心一点。
My wife and I quickly division of labor, in Boxer, Jingdong, hungry on order a variety of items, rice, noodles, oil, vegetables, meat, eggs, frozen food, canned goods, and the share of parents-in-law's home, after a morning of fighting, looked at the word "stores" a little reassuring.
到了晚上，冰箱和储物架满满当当，父母和女儿体温正常，精神都不错，我们稍微宽心下来。
At night, the refrigerator and the shelf are full, my parents and daughter have normal body temperature and are in good spirits. We are a little relieved.
我们打定主意，自我隔离到假期结束，过一个虽然宅在家，但仍能安定祥和的春节。
We made up our minds to isolate ourselves until the end of the holiday and live a quiet and peaceful Spring Festival even though we were at home.
隔离期间自己动手包的饺子全家居家隔离除夕，原本的团圆饭变成分开简餐，年味全无，朋友圈的拜年气氛也不如往年，大部分时间我都在微信和在汉的同学问候，好在大家都平安无事，说笑间就等晚上抢红包了。
During the isolation period, the family separated dumplings made by themselves, the original dinner into a separate simple dinner, the atmosphere of friends than usual New Year, I spent most of the time in micro-letters and Han classmates greetings, but everyone is safe, laughing and waiting for the evening to rob the package.
隔离期间打发时间做的拼图突然，业主群发了图片，楼下张贴居委会告示，要求湖北返沪人员立即报告。
Isolation of the time to do a puzzle suddenly, the owners of the group sent pictures, posted downstairs neighborhood notice, Hubei return to Shanghai personnel immediately reported.
是否要报告？报告后是否会全家被集中隔离？我开始犹豫。
Do you want to report? Will the whole family be segregated after the report? I'm beginning to hesitate.
在与妻子讨论后，我决定还是报备以寻求居委帮助，父母对此也表示赞同。
After discussing it with my wife, I decided to apply for help from the neighborhood committee, and my parents agreed.
我迅速在微信上联系居委副书记许老师告知情况，她迅速回了电话给我，登记具体信息后，对我们家主动支持居委工作表示感谢，并宣示居家隔离的政策。
I quickly contacted the Deputy Secretary of the neighborhood, Mr. Xu, to inform the situation, she quickly called me back to register specific information, after the family volunteered to support the work of the neighborhood, and declare the policy of segregation at home.
略微心安后，我准备看电影娱乐一下，突然发现业主微信群炸锅了。
After a little peace of mind, I am ready to see a movie entertainment, suddenly found that the owners micro-groups of explosives pot.
业主群有人说小区有武汉返沪人员，有业主迅速崛起，历数物业各种黑历史，开始抱怨；居委干部开始安抚业主，说已经在登记武汉返沪人员，目前都在居家隔离，结果业主群担忧更甚，纷纷要求公布房号，甚至提出让武汉返沪家庭离开小区到外面隔离。
The owner group said that Wuhan has returned to Shanghai personnel, owners rapidly rising, listing the various dark history of property, began to complain; neighborhood cadres began to comfort owners, said that Wuhan has been registered back to Shanghai personnel, are currently segregated, owners more worried, and even asked Wuhan back to Shanghai families to leave the community to isolate.
业主们的担忧我很理解，在这场凶险疫情面前，大家面对未知风险都很恐慌，只是想保护好自己和家人。
Owners' concerns I understand that in the face of this dangerous epidemic, people are panicking about the unknown risks and just want to protect themselves and their families.
我给许老师打了电话，又加了居委会书记的微信，请她们保护好我们的信息，也再次重申我们会自觉隔离。
I called Miss Xu and added a letter from the secretary of the neighborhood committee, asking them to protect our message and reasserting our self-imposed isolation.
电话打完，校友群又传来各地封堵武汉返当地人员的信息，莫名的恐惧在心头浮现。
After the phone call, the alumni group came to block Wuhan back to the local personnel information, nameless fear in mind.
我跟父母说了业主群的反应，再次叮嘱下隔离事宜，不料这一信息彻底触发了老人多日来压抑的情绪，紧张、焦虑、委屈和愤怒决堤而来。
I told my parents about the owners' reaction and ordered isolation again, only to find that the message had triggered many days of depression, tension, anxiety, frustration and anger.
父亲说：不管谁来要人，你就把我交出去吧！我马上安抚他：没有谁会来要人，也没有人会让你出去！上海的政策就是有住房的居家隔离。
The father said, Whoever matters, give me over! I assuaged him immediately: No one will come, no one will let you out! The policy in Shanghai is to segregate people with houses.
现在出去是不行的，安心在家是唯一合法做法。
It's no use going out now. Being at home is the only legal thing to do.
跨年夜，我在脑海中反复念叨《沙丘》中保罗·阿崔迪的台词“恐惧是心灵的杀手”，夜不能寐。
Most of the time, I read in my head the lines of Paul Atridy in Dune, "Fear is the killer of the soul," sleepless nights.
初一早上，父母心情稍微平复一些，我和妻子继续在盒马上抢购食物，盒马的供应开始紧张，除送货时间延迟，缺货退款也是常有状态。
On the morning of the first day of junior high school, my wife and I continued to scramble for food in the box. The supply of boxed horses became tight.
中午地段医院派了医生来家里，测量体温，交待每天两次测体温，并拿了三份居家隔离承诺书，告知隔离方法和联系方式，反复叮嘱后也安慰我们，报备以后只有好处没有坏处，任何问题居委和社区都会帮助。
At noon the Lot Hospital sent a doctor to take the temperature, told the temperature twice a day, and took three home isolation commitment letter, told the isolation method and contact information, after repeated instructions also comforted us, only after the benefits of reported no harm, any problem neighborhood and community will help.
医生临走时还表扬了我们家的隔离措施，比如将武汉家人隔离在单独房间，分开用餐，开窗通风配合空净，比走访的其他家庭更科学。
The doctors also praised the family's isolation, such as isolating Wuhan family in separate rooms, eating separate meals, opening windows for ventilation and emptiness, and being more scientific than the other families visited.
“到底是年轻人意识强。
"Young people are very conscious after all.
”由于家人都身体健康，我们稍微安下心。
We settled down a little because our families were in good health.
晚上居委许老师电话过来询问情况，居委会干事们连续奋战也没休息，她对我们家主动报备表示感谢，她们还需继续逐户排查，工作量巨大。
In the evening the neighborhood committee allowed the teachers to call and asked about the situation. The officers of the neighborhood committee worked hard and did not rest.
初二初三，焦虑依旧，除了在工作群里面干活，我好像没有干任何娱乐活动，看书看不进去，看电影没心情，健身又顾虑会不会太累影响抵抗力，微信群里尽是焦虑，我只能多吃几片薯片来缓解心情。
On the third day of junior high school, I still worry, except working in the work group, I do not seem to have any recreational activities, read books, see the film is not in the mood, fitness concerns too tired to affect resistance, micro-letter groups are full of anxiety, I can only eat a few pieces of potato chips to ease the mood.
每天医生来家两次测量体温，每次检测如临大考。
Doctors come home twice a day to take a temperature test, such as a big test.
家里气氛紧张，一声咳嗽能让我心跳起来，虽然大部分只是女儿喝水呛到。
The atmosphere is tense at home, a cough can make my heart beat, although most only daughters drink water choke.
初四，我和妻子意识到不能再这样下去。
In Grade Four, my wife and I realized we couldn't go on like this.
早上起来在盒马上抢菜以后，开始打扫卫生，84消毒液的味道让人有种奇特的安心感。
Wake up in the morning in the box immediately after the food, began to clean up, 84 disinfectant smell people have a strange sense of comfort.
随着时间推移，危险将会远去，快递和物资在接近我们，大家信心越来越足，心情逐渐转好。
With the passage of time, the danger will be far away, express delivery and supplies are approaching us, everyone is more and more confident, the mood gradually improved.
突然，业主群又炸锅了，外地某个快递员确诊的消息激起封小区的声音，虽然群里年轻人在反对，但是最终业委会决定将外卖和快递堵在门外，要求业主自己去大门口取。
Suddenly, the owners of the group of fried pot, a local courier confirmed the message to stir up the community, although the group of young people objected, but eventually the industry decided to take out and express delivery of the door, asked the owner to go to the gate.
原本快递将货送到家门口，我过会儿再拿进来，彼此没有接触。
Originally express delivery of the goods to the door, I will bring in later, no contact with each other.
但快递进不了小区，我又不能出去拿，没有了补给怎么办？焦虑再次袭来。
But express delivery can not enter the community, I can not go out to pick up, how to do without supplies? Anxiety again hit.
友善的邻居家贡献了一袋土豆和青菜放在我们门口，但总是麻烦邻居也不是长策。
Friendly neighbours contribute a bag of potatoes and vegetables to our doorstep, but it is not always a long way to bother our neighbors.
好在，很快居委干部协调物业帮我们家专门递送，保安师傅承担了最后几十米的寄送。
Fortunately, soon the neighborhood cadres to coordinate the property to help us home special delivery, the security master undertook the last dozens of meters of mail.
随后的几天，年前订的快递陆续到达，保安师傅每天不厌其烦跑几趟送货，让我们很感动，也有些不好意思，于是控制两天订一次货。
The following days, the delivery ordered a few years ago, the security master every day on the trouble to make several deliveries, let us very moved, and a little embarrassed, so control the two-day order.
接近初十，父母越发坦然，父亲每天在家骑动感单车、俯卧撑，母亲则要打一套太极拳。
Near the tenth, parents are more open, his father at home every day, push-ups, his mother to play a set of Taijiquan.
但我仿佛要接近考试，心情越发紧张起来。
But I seemed to be getting closer to the exam and getting even more nervous.
一半因为自家状况，另一半则是为家乡的情况，碎片般的信息展示武汉的满目疮痍，各地民间对“武汉人”的恐惧和谩骂不忍卒读，恐惧是远比病毒更凶猛的疾病。
Half because of their own situation, the other half for their hometown, debris-like information on Wuhan's ruins, local fear of "Wuhan people" and abuse, fear is far more ferocious disease than the virus.
解除隔离，继续闭关初十，14天度日如年，终于到了，医院送来解除隔离通知书，我们迅速向居委、幼儿园发去照片，居委干部和幼儿园老师的心情和我们一样愉悦。
At last the hospital sent us a notice of release. We promptly sent photos to the neighborhood committee and the kindergarten. The mood of the neighborhood committee cadres and kindergarten teachers was as happy as ours.
然而自我隔离并没结束，病毒肆虐，我们也不敢出门，我要求家里人仍在家里闭关，除了不再麻烦保安师傅拿快递、倒垃圾，其他什么都不变。
However, self-isolation is not over, the virus rages, we dare not go out, I ask the family to remain closed at home, except no longer trouble the security master to take express delivery, garbage, nothing else.
曾经，在看过《生化危机》《10 Cloverfield lane》之类的电影以后，我也曾想象过末日下在家里做个天天吃泡面打游戏的避难宅，似乎也不赖，但是现实来临得如此仓促，半个多月的时间没有一丝轻松。
Once, after watching films like "The Crisis of Life" and "10 Cloverfield lane," I had imagined a doomsday retreat where I would make a daily bubble-noodle-and-gaming shelter, but the reality came so quickly that there was no respite for more than half a month.
疫情何时结束，接下来的经济、就业、收入的问题，从国家到许多的家庭再到我们自身，面临的压力都会是一座山。
When the epidemic ends, the next economic, employment, and income problems, from the country to many families to ourselves, will face a mountain of stress.
隔离期间，感谢家人特别是妻子的理解与扶持，感谢居委、地段医院、保安师傅的帮助。
During the isolation, thanks to the understanding and support of family members, especially the wife, thanks to the neighborhood committee, the district hospital, security master's help.
如今，京沪校友群陆续传来自己或家人解除隔离的讯息，然而形势依然严峻，仿佛未知的未来已向我们走来。
Today, the Beijing-Shanghai alumni groups are sending a message that they or their families have been lifted, but the situation remains grim, as if the unknown future has come to us.
但我相信，疫情终会被战胜。
But I believe that the epidemic will eventually be overcome.
