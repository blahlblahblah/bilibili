这一治疗手段是在钟南山的建议下加入第七版方案的3月3日，国家卫健委发布《新型冠状病毒肺炎诊疗方案（试行第七版）》。
On March 3, 2007, at the suggestion of Zhong Nan Shan, the National Health Commission issued the "New Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Programme (Trial Version 7)."
在治疗章节里，除了一般的氧疗措施，还增加了“有条件可采用氢氧混合吸入气（H2/O2 : 66.6%/33.3%）治疗。
In the treatment section, in addition to the usual oxygen therapy, "Conditional oxygen inhalation (H2 / O2: 66.6% / 33.3%) can be added.
”《中国新闻周刊》从国家卫健委高级别专家组组长、中国工程院院士钟南山助手苏越明处了解到，这一治疗手段是在钟南山的建议下加入第七版方案的。
"China Newsweek learned from Su Yoming, a senior expert group leader of the National Fitness and Health Commission and an aide to the Chinese Academy of Engineering, Zhong Nan Shan, that the treatment was added to the seventh edition at the suggestion of Zhong Nan Shan.
苏越明称，氢气治疗加入方案是经过了讨论的。
Soyeming said the hydrogen treatment option was discussed.
对于吸氢的安全性和有效性，苏越明称，吸氢虽然不能杀灭病毒，却能改善症状。
As for the safety and efficacy of hydrogen absorption, the more clearly said that hydrogen absorption, while not killing the virus, can improve symptoms.
但对于具体能改善哪些症状，苏越明没能给出答复。
But Mr Su could not answer precisely which symptoms could be improved.
他还介绍说，吸氢不仅能用于新冠肺炎的治疗，也能用于治疗其他疾病。
Hydrogen absorption can be used not only to treat new crown pneumonia, but also to treat other diseases, he said.
吸氢疗法进入到第七版方案后，引发关注，有人直指这是“伪科学”。
The introduction of hydrogen-absorbing therapy into the seventh edition of the plan has raised concerns that it is "pseudoscience."
实际上，这不是吸氢疗法第一次引发争议。
In fact, this is not the first time hydrogen-based therapy has been controversial.
2019年6月，暨南大学附属复大肿瘤医院创始人、荣誉总院长徐克成出版了新书《氢气控癌——理论和实践》，基于 82例吸氢的中晚期癌症患者随访，得出了氢气可以控癌的结论，当时招致多方质疑。
In June 2019, Xu Kecheng, founder and honorary director of the Fu Da Oncology Hospital attached to Jinan University, published a new book, "Hydrogen Cancer Control - Theory and Practice," based on a follow-up of 82 patients with advanced and mid-stage cancer who had absorbed hydrogen, leading to the conclusion that hydrogen could control cancer.
对此，《中国新闻周刊》曾采访了徐克成与相关专家，对此做了深度报道。
To this, "China News Weekly" had interviewed Tsui Kecheng and related experts, made an in-depth report on this.
82例患癌吸氢报告徐克成氢气治疗的一个成功病例是广州市60岁的退休教师全孝莲。
A successful case of 82 cases of cancer treated with hydrogen was reported to be a 60-year-old retired teacher in Guangzhou.
全孝莲患有卵巢癌III期、复发伴多发性转移，患癌5年来，经历过5次化疗，但肿瘤标记物一直没下降，还有带状疱疹。
Quan Xiaolian has ovarian cancer phase III, recurrence with multiple metastasis, cancer for five years, has undergone five chemotherapy, but tumor markers have not declined, and herpes zoster.
2018年6月底，她停止了化疗，坚持吸氢一个月后，指标下降到了正常范围。
By the end of June 2018, she had stopped chemotherapy and, after a month of hydrogen consumption, had dropped to its normal range.
这一过程记录在《氢气控癌》中。
The process is documented in "Hydrogen Cancer Control."
“（后面）观察了几个月，盆腔和腹腔转移未复发，但腹股沟淋巴结出现转移，接受了手术。
"After several months of observation, pelvic and peritoneal metastases did not recur, but the inguinal lymph nodes metastasized and underwent surgery.
”2019年6月，徐克成接受《中国新闻周刊》采访时说。
In an interview with China News Weekly in June 2019, Mr Tsui said.
徐克成的《氢气控癌——理论和实践》一书，封面上写着“肿瘤康复颠覆性探索”“天然之气，居家康复，生理之气，无药为医”等字样。
The book, "Hydrogen Cancer Control - Theory and Practice," has the words "Tumor recovery subversive" on its cover. "Natural gas, home healing, physical breath, no medicine for medicine."
书的正文前面，有肝癌专家、中国工程院院士汤钊猷，内科血液学专家、工程院院士王振义，“肝胆外科之父”、中科院院士吴孟超，呼吸病专家、中国工程院院士钟南山四位大家分别作的评述。
In front of the book are liver cancer experts, Chinese Academy of Engineering Fellow Tang Zhaoyi, internal medicine hematology expert and academician Wang Zhenyi, "Father of Hepatobiliary Surgery," Academician Wu Mengchao of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and remarks by four experts on respiratory diseases and academician Zhong Nan Shan of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
徐克成自己就是一名癌症患者。
Tsui himself is a cancer patient.
十多年前，在氢分子医学逐渐在国内走红并在各地看到一些癌症患者吸氢“神奇康复”后，他决定投身这一领域。
More than a decade ago, he decided to devote himself to the field after hydrogen molecular medicine became popular at home and some cancer patients were seen to "miraculously recover" from hydrogen.
他在其健康工作室设立了三四十台氢氧气雾化机，产生氢浓度66.7％、氧浓度33.3％的混合气体。
He set up thirty or forty hydrogen oxygen atomizers in his health studio, producing a mixture of 66.7 per cent hydrogen and 33.3 per cent oxygen.
每天，有上百人前来免费吸氢，这也是其找寻病例、做随访观察的部分来源。
Every day, hundreds of people come for free, which is part of their search for cases and follow-up observations.
在书中写到的82例癌症患者中，受访者每天吸氢时间不少于1.5小时，至少要连续吸3个月。
Of the 82 cancer patients covered in the book, the subjects drank hydrogen for no less than 1.5 hours a day and smoked for at least three months.
患者的癌症种类包括肺癌、肝癌、妇科恶性肿瘤、胰腺癌、乳腺癌等十余种，所有受访者都为癌症的III期和IV期患者。
The types of cancer included lung cancer, liver cancer, gynecological malignancy, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer and so on, all of whom were patients with stage III and IV cancer.
“排除I期和II期患者，（因为）治疗效果很难判断，很可能有化疗等其他因素的影响，而且，III期和IV期患者，都是接受了常规治疗没有效果后，到这里来的。
"Excluding Phase I and Phase II patients, it is very difficult to judge the therapeutic effect, it is likely to be influenced by other factors such as chemotherapy, and phase III and IV patients came here after routine treatment failed.
”而实际过程中，III期、IV期患者中也有吸氢气和放化疗联合治疗的情况。
The combination of hydrogen absorption and radiation and chemotherapy was also found in phase III and IV patients.
通过对82例患者为期3～46个月不等的随访，徐克成发现，患者食欲、睡眠等生活质量有明显改善，不同肿瘤类型患者体能改善状况不同，其中肺癌患者效果最好，妇科肿瘤及胰腺患者效果最差。
Through the follow-up of 82 patients for 3 to 46 months, Xu Kecheng found that the patients' appetite, sleep and other quality of life improved obviously. Different types of cancer patients had different energy improvement conditions, among which lung cancer patients had the best effect, gynecological tumors and pancreas patients had the worst results.
在肿瘤标记物方面，呈现相同的趋势，肺癌患者肿瘤标记物下降率最高，达到75％，胰腺癌、肝癌患者无人下降。
In terms of tumor markers, the same trend was observed, with tumour markers declining the most in lung cancer patients, reaching 75 per cent, with no decline in pancreatic cancer and liver cancer.
疾病控制上，肺癌控制率最高，大于78.9％，胰腺癌最低，为20％，而且，III期病患的控制率高于IV期。
In terms of disease control, lung cancer control was highest at 78.9%, pancreatic cancer was lowest at 20%, and the control rate of phase III patients was higher than phase IV.
同时，有12例患者因病情发展、感染等原因死亡。
At the same time, 12 patients died as a result of disease development, infection and other causes.
通过观察，徐克成得出结论，吸入氢气能控制癌症进展。
Through observation, Tsukiji concludes that inhalation of hydrogen can control cancer progression.
而所谓控癌，徐克成强调称，不是指“治疗”，而是“康复”，即完成癌症主要治疗后，恢复阶段的保健和养生。
But the so-called cancer control, Tsui Kecheng stressed, is not "treatment", but "rehabilitation," that is, after the completion of major cancer treatment, recovery phase of health care and health.
“这是我自己界定的，回避一个法律风险，我认为，这是一个辅助的手段，不是一个主要的。
"This is what I define myself as, to avoid a legal risk, and I think it is a subsidiary means, not a major one."
”氢气医学源于东亚氧化损伤与炎症被视为多种疾病发生的基础。
Hydrogen medicine, derived from oxidative damage and inflammation in East Asia, is regarded as the basis for many diseases.
徐克成认定吸氢控癌有效的一个根本原因在于目前被公认的氢气的选择性抗氧化作用及抗炎症作用。
The selective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of hydrogen were recognized as one of the fundamental reasons for the effectiveness of hydrogen absorption in cancer control.
所谓选择性抗氧化，是指氢能中和掉对机体有害的过量自由基，而不影响其他重要物质的运转过程。
The so-called selective oxidation refers to hydrogen energy neutralization harmful to the body of excessive free radicals, without affecting the operation of other important substances.
吸氢治疗在业内被称为氢气医学。
Hydrogen absorption therapy is known in the industry as hydrogen medicine.
在全球范围内，关于氢气治病的研究始于1970年代。
On a global scale, research on hydrogen treatment began in the 1970s.
直到十多年前，氢气选择性抗氧化的推断在日本被提出，氢气医学开始逐渐成为业内研究的一个热点，并于2008年左右进入中国。
Until more than a decade ago, hydrogen selective antioxidant inference was proposed in Japan, hydrogen medicine began to gradually become a hot research topic in the industry, and entered China around 2008.
第二军医大学海军医学系教授孙学军是国内氢气医学研究第一人，2014年3月，中国医疗保健国际交流促进会氢分子生物医学专业委员会成立，孙学军任主任。
Sun Xuejun, a professor in the department of naval medicine at the Second Military Medical University, was the first person to study hydrogen medicine in China. In March 2014, the China Council for the Promotion of International Exchange of Hydrogen Molecular Biomedical Sciences was established.
孙学军介绍称，过去12年来，世界范围内共有1200多篇氢分子医学论文发布，其中来自中国的文献占了论文总篇数的55％，日本则占33％。
Over the past 12 years, more than 1,200 papers on hydrogen have been published worldwide, with China accounting for 55 percent of the total and Japan for 33 percent, Sun said.
这期间，除了抗氧化、抗炎症作用，氢气的抗凋亡、调节细胞信号通路等机制也被研究者提出，而抗凋亡的解释本质上依然是消灭过多自由基。
In addition to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, the anti-apoptosis of hydrogen and the regulation of cell signaling pathways have also been proposed.
同时，值得注意的是，1200多篇论文中，绝大多数都为动物实验模型，关于人的临床研究仅有60多篇，涉及氢气对糖尿病、痛风、心肌缺血、高脂血症等病症的作用，但都为小规模的人群研究，证据等级不高，而有关癌症的人体临床研究数据更少之又少。
At the same time, it is worth noting that the vast majority of the more than 1,200 papers are animal models and only more than 60 clinical studies on humans, covering the effects of hydrogen on diabetes, gout, myocardial ischemia, hyperlipidemia, etc., are small-scale population studies with little evidence and very few human clinical studies on cancer.
孙学军说，目前，氢气的选择性抗氧化作用也只是基于观察到的减轻炎症等现象所给出的一种解释，科研人员对于氢分子在体内具体作用的机制实际上并不清楚，“氢分子比较小，不好标记追踪，它的反应过程我们现在是不掌握的”。
"The selective oxidation of hydrogen is only one explanation for the observed reduction of inflammation," Sun said. "The mechanism by which hydrogen molecules work in the body is actually unclear." Hydrogen molecules are relatively small, difficult to mark and trace, and we don't know how they react, "Sun said.
上海中医药大学附属龙华医院肿瘤科副主任医师于观贞认为，徐克成所做的这项研究只属于“零星个案报道”，而且，方案设计中，“病种比较乱”，治疗方式中也有着单独吸氢、氢气+放化疗联合治疗等多种形式，这会使得数据处理、结果分析有偏差。
Yu Guanzhen, deputy director of oncology at the Longhua Hospital attached to Shanghai TCM University, said the study was only "sporadic case reports" and that the design of the plan involved a combination of hydrogen absorption alone, hydrogen + radiation and chemotherapy, which could skew data processing and result analysis.
“氢气运用到人身上是非常复杂的，现在这么做有点过了，没有到完全成为医疗手段的程度，容易让病人产生误解。
"Hydrogen is very complex to apply to people, and it's a bit too complicated to be completely medical, and it's easy for patients to misunderstand.
” 第九OO医院肿瘤科副主任医师房文铮认为，这一研究并没有遵循标准严格的临床试验方案设计，病例也只有80余例，“可信度很差”。
Fang Wenzheng, deputy director of oncology at the Ninth OO Hospital, said the study did not follow a standard clinical trial plan, with only 80 cases and "poor credibility."
北京工业大学生命科学与生物工程学院教授马雪梅近年来一直致力于氢分子生物学研究。
Ma Xuemei, professor of life sciences and bioengineering at Beijing Polytechnic University, has been studying hydrogen molecular biology in recent years.
她分析说，科学需要严谨，个案代表不了一个领域的发展，从徐克成的研究来看，只能说为氢分子医学的研究提供了一些线索，而且，数据量还不够，当数据量足够，并且采用很好的实验设计手段后，才可以称之为证据。
She said that science needed to be rigorous, that individual cases did not represent developments in one area, and that Tsui's research could only provide clues for the study of hydrogen molecular medicine, and that the amount of data was not sufficient and could only be called evidence when sufficient data were available and good experimental design techniques were used.
在她看来，对于不同类型的肿瘤，氢气所起到的作用会有差别，而即便对于同一种类的疾病，不同人群的治疗效果也有不同。
In her view, hydrogen would make a difference for different types of tumours, and even for the same type of disease, different populations would have different therapeutic effects.
孙学军称，目前，对于氢气治疗疾病还没有得出最终的结论，“就是说证据还不是非常充足，只是看到一些现象。
So far, no definitive conclusions have been drawn on hydrogen treatment, "meaning the evidence is not very strong, just a few signs," Sun said.
”氢气治疗的安全性也有待进一步研究。
The safety of hydrogen treatment also needs further study.
在业内分析中，大都把氢气描述为一种极其安全的气体。
In industry analysis, hydrogen is mostly described as an extremely safe gas.
但孙学军在一篇论文中提及：有关氢气安全、无明显毒副作用的认识，主要来自潜水医学中应用高压氢气对人体无明显影响的理论推断，未见系统的生物安全性评价研究报道。
However, Sun Xuejun said in a paper that the understanding of hydrogen safety and no obvious side effects mainly comes from the theoretical inference that the application of high-pressure hydrogen in diving medicine has no obvious effect on human body.
至于有效性，业内不少声音也对此发出疑问。
As for effectiveness, many voices in the industry have questioned this.
美国匹兹堡大学医学院教授马克·格拉德温曾在《自然医学》期刊上发文称，外界给予的氢气远远低于有机体内还原性物质的含量，氢分子与羟自由基发生反应的速率也远远小于体内还原性物质，难以解释少量氢气在如此低的反应速率下依然可以起到清除自由基并表现出显著的抗氧化作用这一现象。
According to Mark Gladwynn, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in the journal Nature Medicine, hydrogen is given far less hydrogen to react with hydroxyl radicals at a much slower rate than hydroxyl radicals, explaining why small amounts of hydrogen still scavenge free radicals and exhibit significant antioxidant activity at such low reaction rates.
德国癌症研究中心博士迪克·托拜厄斯·彼得则分析称，像动脉粥样硬化、冠心病、帕金森、肿瘤等疾病中氧化损伤的作用可能被夸大。
Dr Dick Tobias Peter of the Cancer Research Centre in Germany said oxidative damage from diseases such as atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, Parkinson's disease and tumours could be exaggerated.
钟南山团队的研究现实层面，想要证明氢气有效性的最好方法是开展多中心随机双盲对照临床试验。
The best way to demonstrate the effectiveness of hydrogen is to conduct a multicenter, randomized, double-blind controlled clinical trial, Zhong Nan-shan's team studied reality.
记者从市面上生产氢氧气雾化机的主要厂家之一上海潓美医疗科技有限公司了解到，几年前，中国工程院院士钟南山及其团队就开始在国内十多家医院开展6项氢气治疗多中心随机双盲对照研究，共有800余名患者入组。
A few years ago, Zhong Nan-shan, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, and his team began six multi-center randomized double-blind control studies of hydrogen treatment in more than a dozen hospitals in China, with more than 800 patients in the group.
其中，有152人参与的过敏性鼻炎氢气辅助治疗和108人入组的慢性阻塞性肺疾病急性发作的氢气辅助治疗两项研究已完成，但以上研究的结果尚未见公开发表。
Two studies, on hydrogen-assisted treatment of allergic rhinitis and hydrogen-assisted treatment of acute episodes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 108 people, have been completed, but the results of these studies have not yet been published.
另有一项非小细胞肺癌氢气辅助治疗的研究尚在伦理申报中。
Another study of hydrogen-assisted therapy for non-small-cell lung cancer is still in the process of ethical reporting.
据《中国新闻周刊》查询，上海潓美医疗科技有限公司生产的氢氧气雾化机价位在三四万元左右。
According to China News Weekly, the price of hydrogen and oxygen atomizer produced by Shanghai Zomai Medical Technology Co. Ltd is around 40, 000 yuan.
通过天眼查查询，上海潓美医疗科技为广州南山氢分子医学科技有限公司股东，认缴金额700万人民币，控股70%。
China Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Gazette [Issue No.36 2007] [Issue No.36 2007]
广州南山氢分子医学科技另外30%股份，由广州南山健康科技创新中心掌控。
Another 30% of Nanshan Hydrogen Molecular Medicine in Guangzhou is controlled by Guangzhou Nanshan Center for Health Science and Technology Innovation.

The managing partner of Guangzhou Nanshan Center for Health Science Technology and Innovation is Zhou Rong, director of Zhong Nan Shan Medical Development Foundation of Guangdong Province since May 2011.
据基金会官网介绍，广东省钟南山医学基金会是在钟南山院士领导下，由呼吸疾病国家重点实验室产学研基地、国家呼吸系统疾病临床医学研究中心产学研分中心发起，以钟南山院士名字命名，于2011年7月5日正式注册成立的独立法人非公募基金会。
The Zhong Nan Shan Medical Foundation, an independent non-public foundation officially registered on July 5, 2011 under the leadership of academician Zhong Nan Shan, was launched by the State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases and the Research Sub-Center for Research in Clinical Medicine of Respiratory Diseases, named after the academician Zhong Nan Shan.
2016年4月16日，由中华国际医学交流基金会主办，上海潓美医疗科技有限公司承办的世界胸科大会“氢分子医学与肺部疾病”卫星会在上海召开，钟南山出席主持会议，称中国在氢分子医学研究领域发展前景广阔。
On April 16, 2016, the World Chest Congress "Hydrogen Molecular Medicine and Pulmonary Disease," hosted by the China International Medical Exchange Foundation and hosted by Shanghai Zemei Medical Technology Co. Ltd., will be held in Shanghai.
在上海市科学技术协会的官网上，2016年4月27日，发布了关于批准建立2016年度第一批院士专家工作站的通知，其中钟南山院士工作站的建站单位为上海潓美医疗科技有限公司。
On the official website of the Shanghai Science and Technology Association, on 27 April 2016, a notice was issued approving the establishment of the first expert workstations for academicians in 2016.
