从1月23日开始，武汉、黄冈、鄂州、荆门等多个湖北城市陆续宣布实施全面交通管制。
From January 23 onwards, Wuhan, Huanggang, Huizhou, Jingmen and other Hubei cities announced the implementation of comprehensive traffic control.
随后，浙江、湖南、广东、广西等省市启动一级应急响应。
Subsequently, Zhejiang, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi and other provinces and municipalities launched a first-level emergency response.
城市、村镇、小区、家庭开始层层隔离，十几天里，人们被迅速地划分成了一座座彼此独立的岛屿。
Cities, towns, villages, small areas, families began to layers of isolation, and within a few days, people were quickly divided into separate islands.

在尚看不见尽头的隔离中，一些人想用游戏在岛屿间架起桥梁。
In the still-unseen isolation, some people want to build bridges between the islands with games.

1月23日凌晨2点半，卡卡在微博上看到了武汉公共交通停运、离汉通道关闭的消息。
At 2: 30 a.m. on January 23, Kaka saw the news of the suspension of public transport in Wuhan and the closure of the Han Channel.
。
.
她的第一反应是：可以理解，但为什么要在半夜发布这么重要的事情？转念一想，倒是能踏实一点儿了。
Her first reaction was, understandably, but why release such an important thing in the middle of the night? On second thought, it was a bit more reassuring.
在此之前，她母亲每天坚持不戴口罩出门，她在新闻里看到疫情一天比一天严重，又劝不动母亲，只能躲在自己房间里抱着猫偷偷哭。
Before that, her mother insisted on going out without a mask every day, and she saw in the news that the epidemic was getting worse every day, and she could not persuade her mother to hide in her room and hold the cat in her arms.
。
.
卡卡家住武昌老城区，离最近的一家定点医院大约3公里。
The Kaka family lives in Wuchang Old Town, about 3 km from the nearest designated hospital.
小区是开放式的，没有物业，无法封锁，针对疫情没有采取任何措施。
The community is open, no property, no blockade, no response to the epidemic.
这里的人们应对新冠肺炎唯一的方法是不出门。
The only way people here can cope with pneumonia is not to go out.
1月22日，武汉市政府规定市民出门必须戴口罩。
On January 22, Wuhan city government made it mandatory for citizens to wear masks when going out.
卡卡看了看家里的存货，护理口罩还有一点，酒精、消毒用品一点也没有。
KaKa looked at the inventory of the house, nursing masks and a little alcohol, disinfectant not at all.
她想了想，还是尽量不出门吧，出门也买不到口罩，不出门好歹没有消耗。
She thought, still try not to go out, go out also cannot buy mask, do not go out good or bad did not consume.
。
.
从大年初一开始，母亲也不出门了。
From the beginning of New Year's Day, mother did not go out.
。
.
公共交通停运后，私家车也面临管制。
Private cars are also subject to regulation after the suspension of public transport.
1月25日，武汉市新冠肺炎疫情防控指挥发布通告，武汉市中心城区区域机动车禁行。
January 25, Wuhan City, the new crown pneumonia command and control issued a notice, Wuhan city center area motor vehicles are banned.
经过了激烈的反弹和讨论之后，武汉交警又发布消息说，“市公安交管部门将对禁止通行的车辆通告车主，对未通告的车辆一律实行通行”。
After a heated reaction and discussion, Wuhan traffic police issued a message that "the city public security traffic control departments will be banned from the vehicle owners, the unannounced vehicles will be implemented throughout.
由于措辞令人费解，这条消息被网友们称为“阅读理解”。
Because of its convoluted wording, the message was referred to as "reading comprehension" by netizens.
。
.
私家车禁行在通告当天如此收尾，但武汉三镇之间、区与区之间仍在隔离。
Private cars were banned on the day of the announcement, but there is still segregation between the towns, districts and districts of Wuhan.
另一个同事向卡卡诉苦，说他的女朋友住在另一个区，两人都没有私家车，彼此连面也见不上了。
Another colleague complained to Kaka that his girlfriend lived in a different district and that neither of them had a private car and could not even see each other.
。

武汉宣布全面交通管制时，家住洪山区的王金还在梦中。
Wuhan announced a comprehensive traffic control, the Hong Kong mountain Wang Jin is still in a dream.
一觉醒来看到消息，她觉得，封晚了。
When she awoke to the news, she felt it was too late.
要走的早走了，本地人想走也没地方去。
The journey was long gone, and the natives had nowhere else to go.
在她看来，之前离开武汉的，大多是回家过年的外地人。
In her view, before leaving Wuhan, are mostly home for the New Year outsider.
。
.
小区很快也被封锁，外人不许出入，快递停运，外卖只能送到小区大门口。
The neighborhood was quickly blocked off, people were not allowed in, express delivery stopped, take-out can only be sent to the gate.
王金说，就算能叫外卖，她也不会叫，不想有人因为她在外面走动。
'Even if she could order a takeaway, she wouldn't scream and nobody would want someone to walk around because she was outside, 'Ms. Wang says.
“如果因为我，导致外卖小哥感染上病毒，我会疯的。
"If I caught the virus because of me, I'd be mad.
”。

与武汉相比，其他城市的情况要好一些。
Compared with Wuhan, the situation in other cities is better.
在扬州，武汉人小虹和她父母已经在家待了将近两周。
In Yangzhou, Wuhan native Xiao Hong and her parents have been at home for nearly two weeks.
。
.
小虹住的小区早早封闭了周围大门，只留一个出入口，所有人必须戴口罩、量体温才能进出。
The small Hong residential area early closed the surrounding door, leaving only an entrance, all must wear masks, temperature to enter and exit.
公共场所和楼道每天消毒，电梯按键贴着保鲜膜。
Public places and corridors are disinfected every day, elevator keys are attached to the plastic wrap.
针对湖北人，小区贴出告示，要求“湖北过来的人”必须主动报备，主动隔离。
For Hubei people, the community posted a notice, requiring "Hubei people to come" must voluntarily report, active isolation.
作为武汉人，小虹一家也要提交个人信息，定时被电话或微信“回访”。
As Wuhan people, small Hong family also have to submit personal information, regular telephone or micro-letter "return visit."
。

一家三口没回武汉过年。
The family did not return to Wuhan New Year.
留在武汉的亲戚说，今年的年夜饭取消了，大家都改用微信拜年，“身体健康”成了最常见的祝福语。
Relatives who stayed in Wuhan said the New Year's Eve meal had been canceled and everyone had to pay a New Year call instead. "Good health" became the most common greeting.

28岁的上海人汤包赋闲在家。
The 28-year-old Shanghainese soup bag is at home.
他是沉浸式戏剧演员，工作在剧场。
He is an immersed theatrical actor who works in a theatre.
1月20日，钟南山院士宣布新型冠状病毒存在人传人。
On January 20, academician Zhong Nan Shan announced the existence of a new coronavirus from person to person.
几乎是同时，社交媒体上有人建议人们不要再去电影院、剧院等人群密集场所。
Almost at the same time, some on social media suggest that people stop going to cinemas, theatres and other crowded places.
汤包所在的剧场也歇了业，这意味着他暂时失去了工作。
The theater where the soup bag was located also broke, which meant that he temporarily lost his job.

除夕当天，张朔回到老家泉州，把PS4、Switch和两只猫留在了北京。
On New Year's Eve, Zhang Shuo returned to his hometown of Quanzhou and left the PS4, Switch and two cats in Beijing.
他原本打算最多一周就回北京，结果在泉州待了快一个月。
He had planned to return to Beijing in a week at the most, and ended up in Quanzhou for almost a month.
他也不是不想回家，但在福建，宗族观念是张朔和许多年轻人不愿回家长住的原因之一。
Nor does he want to go home, but in Fujian, clan attitudes are one reason why Zhang Shuo and many young people do not want to go home.
。
.
张朔住的小区是拆迁后建起来的。
Zhang's residential area was built after the demolition.
大批大批的家族宗亲短暂地离开老房子，又全部搬进同一个小区。
Large numbers of extended family members briefly left the old house and moved into the same neighbourhood.
在现代高层住宅楼的环绕中，一个低矮的小祠堂才是小区真正的中心。
In the modern high-rise residential buildings surrounded by a small low ancestral hall is the real center of the district.
这是张朔在北方城市里无论如何都看不到的。
This is Zhang Shuo in the northern city in any way can not see.
在当地，几乎每个月、每个片区都有不同的祭祀活动，人们聚集在祠堂里，街道上。
In the area, almost every month, each district has a different ritual activities, people gathered in ancestral halls, streets.
“那场景比北京的庙会夸张多了。
"It was much more extravagant than the temple fair in Beijing.
”张朔说。
"said Zhang Shuo.

回家之前，表弟给张朔发微信：我们都在水深火热之中。
Before going home, my cousin sent a message to Zhang Shuo: We are all in deep suffering.
回到泉州那一天，张朔发现自己的外婆“失踪”了。
Back to Quanzhou that day, Zhang Shuo found his grandmother "disappeared."
问过家人，才知道她是跑出去参加祭祀活动，没有人劝得动。
Had asked the family, just knew she was running out to participate in the sacrificial ceremony, no one can persuade.
临近节日，祭祀活动数不胜数，外婆去了哪里，参加了什么，见了多少人，家里人统统不知道。
Near the festival, there are countless sacrificial activities, grandmother went to where, participated in what, see how many people, the family all do not know.
。
.
张朔觉得，这或许是二三线城市的常态。
Zhang Shuo thinks, this is perhaps the norm of two or three line city.
疫情初期，人们从电视、手机上接收到的新闻会让他们觉得事情离自己很远，也不严重，所以根本没有重视。
In the early days of the epidemic, the news people received from TV and cell phones made them feel remote and unimportant, so they didn't take it seriously at all.
直到除夕那天，清源山、仙公山、关帝庙等景点宣布关闭，大家才隐约感觉到，事情可能变了。
Until New Year's Eve, Qingyuan Mountain, Sin Kung Shan, Guandi Temple and other attractions announced the closure, people only vaguely feel that things may have changed.

■ 尝试连接。
▪ Attempt to connect.
与空间上的封闭相反，各种各样的信息透过通讯网络如潮水般漫过目之所及的每一个角落。
In contrast to spatial closeness, information of all kinds flows through communication networks to every corner of the globe.
卡卡打开朋友圈，看到很多人戴着口罩在超市里疯狂囤货，蔬菜、肉类、生活必需品，场景夸张得像灾难电影。
Kaka opened up his circle of friends and saw people stocking up in supermarkets in masks, vegetables, meat, and necessities in an exaggerated, disaster-prone scene.
如果不是自己正身处武汉，她也很难相信这是真实的。
If she were not in Wuhan, it would be hard for her to believe it.
关掉微信，一个外籍同事发来的短信出现在屏幕上：我妻子的表弟一家人确诊了新冠肺炎。
Turning off the message, a text message from a foreign colleague appeared on the screen: My wife's cousin's family confirmed pneumonia.
她迅速地回复了一条“OMG”，接下来就不知道该说什么了。
She quickly replied to an "OMG" and then did not know what to say.
。
.
小虹有一些亲戚在医院工作，有了他们的提醒，全面隔离之前，留在武汉的家人们就开始囤积口罩和一些药品，并且决定取消年夜饭。
With a few relatives working at the hospital, Xiao Hong warned that families left in Wuhan would start hoarding masks and some medicine and decided to cancel Chinese New Year's Eve meal before full quarantine.
随着疫情升级，这些医生、护士也成了最令人担心的人。
As the epidemic escalated, these doctors and nurses became the most worrying people.
他们离危险最近，也能接触到最真实的状况。
They are closest to danger, and they are exposed to the most real situations.
。
.
一个亲戚在隔离病房，每天工作时间都在10小时以上，不能携带通讯设备，每天只能在规定时间、在医院系统内的留言板上写下消息，再用短信发给家属。
A relative in the isolation ward, working more than 10 hours a day, is not allowed to carry communication equipment and can only write messages on a message board in the hospital system for a specified time each day, which is then sent to the family by text message.
这是他们唯一与外界联系的方式。
This is the only way they can communicate with the outside world.
那些发出来的“内部消息”，大多也只是让家人朋友们持续做好防护，注意安全。
Those sent out "inside information," most of the family and friends just to continue to do a good job of protection, attention to safety.
。
.
家庭微信群里，每天最重要的内容是互报平安。
The most important thing in the family micro-group every day is to tell each other peace.
从扬州看武汉，小虹问家里亲戚最多的是，东西缺不缺，防护有没有做好，爱出门遛弯的长辈还去不去。
Looking at Wuhan from Yangzhou, Xiao Hong asked the relatives at home is the most, things do not lack, protection is not well, love to walk out of the eldership or not.
亲戚们也回复一些看起来轻松愉快的话。
Relatives also responded to what appeared to be lighthearted remarks.
一旦提起日渐攀升的确诊病例、死亡人数和不知何时能够结束的隔离，气氛就会压抑起来。
Once the rising number of confirmed cases, the number of deaths and the indeterminate end of isolation are mentioned, the atmosphere is demoralized.
。
.
在家的日子里，小虹会为自己和家人做上几道拿手菜。
During her stay at home, Xiao Hong would cook some special dishes for herself and her family.
在启动一级响应之前，上海的口罩、酒精、消毒用品已经被抢购一空。
Before launching a first-level response, Shanghai had run out of masks, alcohol and disinfectant supplies.
汤包没有买到足够的口罩，1月23日当天，他正在努力劝说家里长辈取消春节聚餐。
The soup bag didn't buy enough masks, and on January 23, he was trying to persuade his elders to cancel the Spring Festival dinner.
他们不是不怕，每个人都很想取消，但谁都不愿意第一个站出来说这件事，这让汤包觉得很烦。
They are not afraid, everyone would like to cancel, but no one would like to be the first to say it, which makes the soup bag very annoying.
。
.
和长辈沟通起来，方法很重要。
It is important to communicate with your elders.
汤包家里很多长辈痴迷长牌——一种类似麻将的纸牌，每天出门玩，雷打不动。
Many elders in the family are crazy about long cards - a kind of mahjong-like playing cards, every day out to play, thunderous.
汤包找到他们之中最有威信、说话最管用的那一位，摆数据讲事实，拿出《人民日报》、新华网上的消息轮番轰炸，成功说服了对方。
The soup bag found the most authoritative and effective one among them, put up the figures and told the truth, and put out the people's daily, Xinhua News website, the news rotation bombing, succeeded in persuading the other side.
有“重量级人物”支持，再劝其他长辈就顺利多了。
Have "heavyweight person" support, persuade other elder generation more smooth.
。
.
如今在武汉，所有人出门必须戴口罩。
Now in Wuhan, everyone has to wear masks when they go out.
王金家里还剩十几个口罩，原本还有些N95，口罩紧缺后，她把N95全部送给了在医院上班的朋友。
Wang still has a dozen masks left in her family, some N95 is still in short supply, and she gave them all to her friends at the hospital.
除了口罩之外，她还给朋友“赞助”了两辆电动自行车——武汉交管局宣布交通限制之后，家里3辆电动自行车她只留下一辆自用，剩下的都借了出去。
In addition to the mask, she has "sponsored" two electric bicycles for her friends - she kept only one of the family's three electric bicycles after the Wuhan Transportation Authority announced traffic restrictions, and borrowed the rest.
她想，朋友在医院工作都已经累坏了，总不能再让她们走路上班吧？。
Her friends, she thought, were worn out after working in the hospital, and they couldn't walk to work anymore.
王金有不少亲戚朋友在一线：医生、护士、警察、基层公务员。
Wang has many relatives and friends in the front line: doctors, nurses, police, grass-roots civil servants.
和人聊QQ、微信时，一有机会她就号召大家，能不出门尽量不出，少给一线工作者添乱。
Talk with people QQ, micro-letter, every opportunity she calls on everyone, can not go out as far as possible, less to the front-line workers.
。
.
为了不添乱，王金一直宅在家里，除了玩游戏，还报名当志愿者，帮那些不知道自己社区联系方式和沟通渠道的人对接消息。
In order not to add to the chaos, Wang Jin has been at home, in addition to playing games, but also signed up as volunteers, to help those who do not know their community contacts and communication channels.
。
.
有些时候，玩家和志愿者的身份也不是泾渭分明的。
Sometimes the identity of players and volunteers is not clear-cut.
她加过几个武汉玩家群，里面虽然都是玩家，喜欢的游戏却都不一样，不一定能聊得到一起。
She has added a few Wuhan players, although all of them are players, like the game is not the same, not necessarily chat together.
但只要群里有人求助，她总是帮忙想办法。
But whenever someone in the group asked for help, she always helped.
有一次，群友说买不到肉和菜，社区也没有安排送菜，她立刻转发了一个小程序，告诉对方，可以看看这里送不送。
Once, a group of friends said that they could not buy meat and vegetables, the community did not arrange to deliver food, she immediately forwarded a small program to tell each other, can see whether there is delivery here.
。
.
在泉州，最先响应变化的仍然是年轻人。
In Quanzhou, young people are still the first to respond to change.
1月24日，张朔去药店买口罩，N95口罩每个售价25元，每人限购3个。
On January 24, Zhang Shuo went to the pharmacy to buy a mask. N95 masks cost 25 yuan each and each one was limited to three.
两个20多岁的年轻人排在他后面，一看就是跑了很多地方买口罩的，一边抱怨贵，一边掏钱。
Two young men in their 20s lined up behind him and saw that they were running around to buy masks, complaining and paying for them.
。
.
想让长辈改变主意就没那么容易。
It's not so easy to get older people to change their minds.
年初一，家里亲戚组织去海鲜酒楼吃饭，张朔“以死相逼”，把父母留在了家里。
On the first day of the new year, family relatives organized to eat at the seafood restaurant, Zhang Shuo "by the death threat," leaving their parents at home.
他回想起当天自己的爆发，那种痛苦和愤怒还记忆犹新。
He remembered the outburst of his own day, and the pain and anger still fresh in his mind.
。
.
疫情期间，劝长辈不出门有套常见话术：因为疫情严重，今年少吃这一次饭，保重身体，以后还有机会再吃……一般人说到这里，也就差不多了，但在张朔家里，这些话几乎不起作用。
During the epidemic, the elders do not go out to have a common set of tricks: because of the serious epidemic, this time eat less rice, take care of the body, and later the opportunity to eat... ordinary people here, it is almost the same, but in the Zhangshuo family, these words have little effect.
在父母长辈心目中，过节和聚餐是规矩的一部分，而规矩就是在某个时间一定要做某件事，假如你不做，别人就会觉得你们家有问题。
In the minds of parents and elders, festivals and dinners are part of the rules, and the rule is to do something at some time. If you don't do it, people will think you have a problem.
。
.
年轻人受不了这些规矩。
Young people can't stand these rules.
张朔表面上对母亲大吼大叫，心里却充满了无力感。
Zhang Shuo on the surface yell at his mother, but filled with a sense of powerlessness.
不论他怎么说，母亲明知身体健康更重要，却仍然觉得不出门不好，不和亲戚聚会不好，不守规矩不好。
No matter what he said, his mother knew her health was more important, but she still felt that it was not good to stay in the house, not to have a party with relatives, and not to behave well.
这让他彻底放弃了讲道理，改用道德绑架：他对父母说，你们要是去吃饭，我立刻买机票回北京。
This led him to abandon his reasoning once and for all and to resort to moral kidnapping: he told his parents that if you went to dinner, I would buy a plane ticket back to Beijing immediately.
。
.
好的是，张朔发现，状况在慢慢改变。
Fortunately, Zhang Shuo found that the situation is slowly changing.
。
.
年初一的聚餐，虽然张朔一家缺席，但表弟后来对他说，当时整个酒楼里只有他们一桌人，其他亲戚吃饭时，知道他把父母硬留在家里，也是支持的声音居多。
Although Zhang Shuo's family was absent from the dinner on New Year's Day, his cousin later told him that they were the only ones at the table and that the other relatives knew that he had forced his parents to stay at home.
年初三，外婆家的亲戚本来要聚会，但组局的人看到疫情严重，直接取消了。
On the third day of New Year, Grandmothers relatives were supposed to get together, but the organizers saw that the outbreak was serious and cancelled.
张朔觉得，这说不定是个开端。
Zhang Shuo thinks, this may be a beginning.

■ 游戏的意义。
:: Meaning of the game.
社交平台上，来自武汉和湖北其他城市的求救塞满了卡卡的首页。
On the social platform, calls from Wuhan and other cities in Hubei filled Kaka's home page.
她在那些求救信息里看到了自己的朋友、朋友的家人、朋友的朋友，但除了转发和担忧之外做不了什么；另一些朋友的账号消失，重新出现，又永久消失，也让她觉得难过。
She saw friends, friends' families, friends' friends in those distress messages, but did little more than forward and worry; other friends' accounts disappeared, reappeared, and vanished for good.
。
.
心灵上的痛苦逐渐转化成身体上的变化。
The pain of the mind gradually transforms into a physical change.
由于“待在家里没消耗”，从隔离开始，她的食量从一天三顿饭，变成一天两顿、一天一顿、两天一顿，后来经常两三天吃一顿饭。
Since staying home is not consumed, she has gone from eating three meals a day to two meals a day, one meal a day, two meals a day, and a meal two or three days later.
她觉得自己身体没什么问题，就是不饿，不想吃饭。
She felt well, but she was not hungry and did not want to eat.
为了集中精神，她把以前攒下来、一直没时间做的钢普拉拿出来拼。
In order to concentrate, she pulled out the steel pula, which she had saved and never had time to make.
拼好了，就和猫一起拍张照片。
When it's finished, we'll take a picture with the cat.
。
.
猫与钢普拉。
Cats and Steel Plat.
在钢普拉之外，卡卡开始试着玩游戏。
Outside of Winfrey, Kaka began to try to play games.
有几个同事沉迷《魔兽世界》和《天堂2》怀旧服，但她平时本不热衷游戏，也不擅长，这些大型游戏她都玩不来。
Some of her co-workers are nostalgic for World of Warcraft and Paradise 2, but she wasn't usually keen on games and wasn't good at them.
另一个微信群里，有朋友请她帮忙点击微信小程序里的《动物餐厅》，她点开看了看，就一直玩了下去。
In another microphone group, a friend asked her to help click on Animal Restaurant in the microphone app. She looked at it and played on.
。
.
《动物餐厅》是个放置类游戏，非常简单。
Animal Restaurant is a game of placement. It's very simple.
每一天，卡卡每隔一段时间就打开《动物餐厅》，看看攒了多少小鱼干，有没有新顾客，能不能解锁新成就。
Every day, Kaka would open Animal Restaurant from time to time to see how many little fish he had saved, whether he had new customers, and whether he could unlock new achievements.
但她也不是真的在乎这个“餐厅”经营得怎么样，只是在微信群里和朋友们互聊聊游戏，互相点点链接，帮忙做做任务，让她感觉到自己还和外面的世界保持着联系。
But she doesn't really care how the restaurant works. She just chats with friends in microphone groups, links to each other, helps with errands, and makes her feel connected to the outside world.
。
.
后来，卡卡收到一个朋友报平安的消息。
Later, Kaka received news of the safety of a friend.
朋友说，她们一家三口趁着还能离开武汉时，连夜赶回了昆明娘家，因为孩子刚满一岁，她不想冒险留在武汉。
Friends said that while they were still able to leave Wuhan, the family rushed back to Kunming overnight, because the child just turned one year old, she did not want to risk staying in Wuhan.
到昆明之后，她们去社区汇报，到医院检查，然后在家隔离，如今看来没有什么问题。
When they arrived in Kunming, they went to the community to report, went to the hospital, and then isolated at home.
卡卡放下手机，心想，既然哪里都要隔离，那么在哪里也都一样。
KaKa put her cell phone down and thought, Since it's going to be isolated everywhere, it's the same everywhere.
。
.
小虹有不少爱好，逛街、旅游、读书、美食、游戏，她都喜欢。
Little Hong has a lot of hobbies, shopping, travel, reading, food, games, she likes.
如今隔离在家，就只剩下了游戏。
Now the only thing left is the game, isolated at home.
小虹从小学开始接触游戏，到现在大四，已经成了一个资深PC玩家。
Xiaohong from the primary school contact game, to now senior four, has become a senior PC player.
她喜欢剧情精彩的单机游戏，也喜欢快节奏对抗的在线游戏，常和朋友一起“守望”“吃鸡”，也会一个人玩“巫师”“过山车之星”系列。
She loves single-player, fast-paced online games, often with friends "watch", "eat chicken," but also a person to play "wizard" "roller coaster" series.
上课、实习的时候，她每天只能玩两三个小时游戏，现在就完全不同，每天花六七个小时玩游戏，是很常见的事儿。
She could only play two or three hours a day during class and practice. Now it was quite different. It was common for her to spend six or seven hours a day playing games.
。
.
像小虹这样的玩家不在少数。
There are many players like Xiao Hong.
春节前后，腾讯、网易等国内游戏公司呈现出一片蒸蒸日上的态势。
Around Spring Festival, Tencent, Netease and other domestic game companies show a thriving situation.
有报道称，疫情期间中国手机游戏用户规模较平日增长30%，人均单日使用时长增长17.8%，《王者荣耀》春节期间日活跃用户量峰值超过1亿。
Mobile gamers in China are reported to have grown by 30 per cent on weekdays, 17.8 per cent per person per day and more than 100 million mobile gamers per day during the Spring Festival.
2月3日，Steam同时在线用户数超过1880万，突破了两年前的纪录。
On February 3, Steam had more than 18.8 million subscribers online, surpassing the record set two years ago.
。
.
人多了，游戏环境就不好说了。
More people, the game environment is difficult to say.
小虹打开自己常玩的几个FPS游戏，“吃鸡”总能遇到自瞄、透视挂；《反恐精英：全球行动》，5把里至少3把有挂；《守望先锋》大师分段，几乎每一局都有外挂和代练。
Little Hong opened several FPS games she often played. "Chicken Eating" always met with self-sighting and perspective hanging; "Anti-Terror Elites: Global Action," with at least three of them hanging up; and "Watching Pioneer" Master Segment, with hanging and acting in almost every innings.
。
.
小虹觉得自己的FPS水平“还可以”。
Xiao Hong thinks his FPS level is "OK."
往常，父母不支持她玩游戏，觉得“女孩子打游戏不好”。
Usually, her parents do not support her play games, feel that "girls do not play well."
现在，为了消磨时间，缓解气氛，父母也开始和武汉的亲戚长辈们在线玩麻将、斗地主。
Now, to kill time and ease the atmosphere, parents and relatives in Wuhan began to play Mahjong online, fighting landlord.
看到小虹屏幕里的《饥荒：联机版》和《GTA Online》，他们只是提醒：别坐太久了，隔一会儿得起来活动活动。
Seeing "Famine: Online" and "GTA Online" on the rainbow screen, they were simply warning: Don't sit too long and get up and active.
。
.
很多时候，游戏意味着社交，至少是社交的重要弥补。
In many cases, play means socializing, or at least making up for it socially.
小虹关系最好的几个朋友都是在游戏里认识的。
The few friends who have the best relationship with Xiao Hong have met in the game.
随着隔离时间越来越长，她受朋友邀请，开始玩些简单欢乐的多人小游戏。
As the hours of isolation grew longer, she was invited by her friends to play simple, fun multiplayer games.
。
.
这个时候，越简单的游戏越受欢迎。
At this point, the simpler the game the more popular it is.
对许多原本不接触游戏的人来说，即使是公认社交强度高的MOBA、卡牌对战手游，也嫌太过复杂，他们更喜欢微信小程序里那些不用下载，打开就能玩的游戏。
For many non-gamers, even MOBA and cards, which are generally considered socially strong, are too complicated for the hand-to-hand game, preferring microphone apps that can be played without downloading.
“你画我猜”“猜歌名”等等流行于80后、90后童年时代的游戏借着微信平台的东风，一跃成为炙手可热的游戏。
"You draw me guess" "Guess the title" and so on popular in the 1980s, 90 after the game of childhood by the micro-mail platform, jumped into a hot game.
打开微信小程序搜索“你画我猜”，70多个大同小异的游戏等待着人们线上组局。
Open the micro-program search "You paint me guess", more than 70 similar games waiting for people to organize online.
。
.
小虹也连续玩了两三天“你画我猜”。
Little Hong also played for two or three days "You draw me guess."
一起玩的都是认识的朋友，气氛很轻松、很搞笑，玩一轮花的时间不长，也不耽误做其他事情。
Playing together is known friends, the atmosphere is very relaxed, very funny, a round of time spent playing, do not delay to do other things.
但即使如此，她还是坚持不了太久，玩个五六轮就觉得疲劳，没几天就放弃了。
But even so, she can not hold out for long, playing five or six rounds on the feeling of fatigue, a few days to give up.
。
.
小虹觉得，“你画我猜”这样的游戏不能维持下去。
Little Hong thinks, "You draw I guess" such game cannot maintain.
“模式太单一，玩着玩着就腻了。
"The pattern is too simple. We're tired of playing.
”由于疫情严重，大部分年轻群体都被困在了家里，这些游戏确实可以帮他们打发时间，满足一部分社交需求，但显然无法长久。
Because of the severity of the epidemic, most young people are trapped in their homes and these games do help them spend time meeting some of their social needs, but are clearly not sustainable.
。
.
汤包同样需要社交。
Soup packets also need socializing.
人待在家里，信息交流却不能少。
While people stay at home, there is no shortage of information.
他对社交本身兴趣不大，但在戏剧行业工作，必须时常了解行业动态，因此总要和同行朋友们聊天、聚会。
He is not very interested in social intercourse per se, but in the theater industry, must constantly understand the industry dynamics, so always chat with friends, get together.
在聚会上，汤包接触到了很多游戏。
At the party, the soup bag came into contact with many games.
。
.
由于从小家教很严，汤包童年时代除了《俄罗斯方块》之外，什么游戏都没玩过。
As a result of strict upbringing, Tang Bao childhood in addition to "Tetris," all the games have never played.
长大之后才接触了几个手游，像是《王者荣耀》《阴阳师百闻牌》，每天不超过20分钟。
After growing up to touch a few hand tour, such as "King's Glory," "Yin Yang Division 100", no more than 20 minutes a day.
后来，他认识了《疑案追声》游戏策划，开始玩一些独立游戏——《Gris》《Her Story》，当然也包括《疑案追声》。
Later, he got to know "Suspicious Case Chase" game planning, began to play a number of independent games - "Chris," "He Story," of course, including "Suspicious Case Chorus.
这些独立游戏让他觉得，游戏其实是一种综合艺术。
These independent games make him feel that the game is actually a comprehensive art.
。
.
归根结底，汤包对游戏的感情不算深。
In the final analysis, the soup bag to the game feelings are not deep.
有没有游戏，他的生活没有太大区别。
There is no game, his life is not very different.
和朋友聚会时，他们玩的大多是聚会游戏：《马力欧派对》《任天堂明星大乱斗》《舞力全开》，还曾经用《模拟人生》的捏脸功能互相设计形象。
When they hang out with friends, they play mostly party games: Mario's Party, Nintendo Star Wars, Dancing All, and have used Sims facial features to create images of each other.
“对我来说，游戏本身不能解压，和朋友们在一起才解压，”汤包说，“所以能和朋友一起玩的游戏就挺好。
"For me, the game itself doesn't decompress, it's just a matter of being with friends," said Tang Bao. "So it's good to play games with friends.
”。
"
想吃Poke Bowl（夏威夷盖饭）的汤包。
Wants to eat the Poke Bowl soup bag.
出不了门，聚不了会，汤包和朋友之间的联系，还剩下游戏。
Can not get out of the door, can not get together, soup bag and friends between the link, but also the game.
更具体点儿说，是在线打牌——由于不喜欢陌生人隔着屏幕骂街，汤包已经很久没有打开《王者荣耀》了，别的游戏也挑不出更好的，选来选去，还是打牌最合适。
More specifically, online poker -- because I don't like strangers swearing across the screen, the soup bag hasn't opened 'The Glory of the King' for a long time, and there's nothing better to choose from than playing cards.
。
.
说是打牌，其实更像聊天。
Say is playing cards, actually more like chatting.
汤包和朋友们一边开着棋牌软件，另一边开着语音，和面对面打牌时一样。
The soup bag was playing board with friends, and the voice on the other side was the same as in a face-to-face game.
疫情期间，汤包在牌桌上感慨过“这个疯狂的世界”，但他也知道，这样的感慨很快会被抱怨手气差、家常琐事、笑话八卦等等更轻松的话题消解过去。
During the outbreak, Tang lamented "this crazy world" at the card table, but he also knew that such lamentations were quickly dispelled by complaints of bad luck, domestic trivia, gossip, etc.
。
.
汤包说，暂时失去工作对他影响不算大，毕竟剧场本来就是项目制的，留在家里多看书多休息，也许以后能做个瘟疫题材的戏。
Tang Bao said the temporary loss of his job did not affect him very much, after all, the theater was originally project-based, stay at home more reading, more rest, perhaps later can do a plague of the drama.

王金和父亲坐在一起，给母亲加油助威。
Wang Jin and his father sat together to cheer his mother up.
。
.
母亲正在打苇名弦一郎，她沉着冷静地格挡、闪避、输出、雷反，一会儿工夫，随着最后一次处决，画面黑屏，“忍杀”的白字亮了起来。
Mother was striking a reed string Ichiro, calmly blocking, dodging, output, thunder, and in a moment, with the last execution, the screen was black, and the white word "kill" came into being.
她放下手柄，对女儿说，这游戏晃眼睛，还是“超级玛丽”好玩。
She put the handle down and told her daughter that the game shook her eyes and was "Super Mary" for fun.
。
.
和许多玩家不一样，王金是被父母带进游戏世界的。
Unlike many players, Wang was brought into the game world by his parents.
从最早的“小霸王”开始，直到PSP3000之前，家里所有的主机、掌机都是父母买的。
From the earliest "bully" to the PSP 3000, all the home hosts, handhelds are bought by parents.
正因如此，一家三口养成了一个习惯：其中一人拿着手柄玩游戏时，另两个人在一边看，Game Over了就换人。
As a result, the family formed a habit of one person playing games with a handle while the other two watched, and Game Over changed hands.
。
.
等到她上了小学，父母又主动教她上网。
When she went to primary school, her parents took the initiative to teach her to surf the Internet.
这不仅没让她染上“网瘾”，反而觉得上网不是什么大不了的事，不值得特殊对待。
Not only did it not make her addicted to the Internet, but it didn't feel like it was a big deal and not deserving of special treatment.
。
.
家里游戏水平最高的，是母亲。
The level of play at home is the highest, is the mother.
王金说，至少在动作游戏领域，母亲比她和父亲加在一起还强。
At least in action games, Ms. Wang says, her mother is better than her father combined.
父女俩玩游戏时都喜欢大呼小叫，输出主要靠吼，操作一变形就手忙脚乱，相比之下，母亲更理智，心定手稳，效率高，总能所向披靡。
Father and daughter like to yell when playing games, the output mainly rely on roar, operation of a deformation on the bustle, compared to the mother, more rational, steady, efficient, always invincible.
。
.
父亲更中意RPG。
Father prefers RPG.
在家隔离的日子里，他天天在《荒野大镖客：救赎2》里骑马、打猎，多少缓解了不能出门的焦虑。
During his days in solitary home, he rode and hunted in Fistula Defiance 2, which somewhat relieved his anxiety about not being able to go out.
。
.
王金说，家里太乱了，所以决定只让她养的兔子出镜。
Wang said the house was so messy that he decided to let only her rabbit show up.
足不出户的日子越来越长。
The days of staying home are getting longer.
父亲喜欢下棋、做菜，不出门影响不大。
Father likes to play chess, cooking, do not go out has little impact.
母亲喜欢跳广场舞，这个习惯一时半会儿改不了，为了跳舞，她每天晚上定时和闺蜜们视频，在客厅里坚持跳。
Her mother likes to dance in the square, this habit can not be changed for a while, in order to dance, she regularly and boudoir video every night, insist on dancing in the living room.
。
.
父亲也支持母亲健身。
Fathers also support their mothers in fitness.
他以前当过军医，深知健康作息的重要性。
He had been a military doctor before and knew the importance of health and rest.
从春节假期到在家隔离，人的时间观念越来越弱，总是睡到中午才起床。
From the Spring Festival to the isolation at home, people's concept of time is weakening, always sleep until noon before getting up.
这让他十分担忧。
It worried him a great deal.
后来，家里规定每天必须早睡早起，早午晚都要运动，坚持吃水果。
Later, the family rule must go to bed and get up early every day, morning and evening exercise, insist on eating fruit.
父亲说，这样做是为了以后复工做准备，不然散漫惯了，身体会吃不消。
Father said, do so in order to get back to work to prepare, otherwise the casual habit, the body will not bear.
。
.
余下的时间，一家三口大多花在了游戏上。
The rest of the time, most of the family spent on games.
王金会和朋友们一起《最终幻想14》，也常在《文明6》里“再来一回合”。
Wang will join his friends in Final Fantasy 14 and will also be in Civilization 6 for another round.
假如在动作游戏里卡了Boss，她已经习惯了“打不过，喊妈妈”，母亲也乐于给女儿多一重依靠。
If Boss got stuck in the action game, she was used to playing, shouting, and the mother was happy to give her daughter more support.
王金决定，在母亲打通《只狼》之后，要给她推荐那个变态版“猫里奥”——既然她喜欢“马里奥”，又擅长动作，想必难不倒她。
Wang decided to recommend the variant, Leo, to her after her mother opened Wolf - since she liked Mario and was good at acting, she would not be too hard on her.
。
.
即使难倒了，王金也不担心自己被母亲揍。
Even if it was difficult, Wang did not worry about being beaten by his mother.
“现在我爹不能再拿下楼遛弯当借口，要揍也是揍他。
"Now my dad can't walk down stairs any more as an excuse to punch him, too.
”说这句话的时候，她很轻松，也很乐观。
"As she said this, she was relaxed and optimistic.

难得有这么长时间和父母相处，张朔决定，趁这个机会，让父母体验他喜欢的东西。
It is rare to spend so much time with his parents. Zhang Shuo decides to take the opportunity to let his parents experience what he likes.
。
.
张朔最大的爱好是游戏。
Zhang Shuo's greatest hobby is games.
但一上来就给父母推荐电子游戏，不太现实。
But when it comes to recommending video games to parents, it's not realistic.
思考过后，他打算和父母一起玩桌游。
After thinking about it, he plans to play table games with his parents.
。
.
家里没有合适的桌游，张朔反复挑选，在一家还能发货的淘宝店下单了“推新神作”《璀璨宝石》。
There is no suitable table games at home, Zhang Shuo repeated selection, in a still can deliver Taobao shop ordered "push new God works" "resplendent gem."
去小区门口取快递时，父母还以为他买了口罩，等到拿回家拆开，才发现是游戏。
To pick up express in front of the community, parents still think he bought a mask, until he took it home to open it, only to find it is a game.
。
.
父母不再批评儿子买游戏，只是说了他几句，这时候还出门取快递，不安全。
The parents no longer criticized his son to buy the game, just said a few words, this time out to pick up express, it is not safe.
张朔告诉他们，买这个游戏是为了和你们一起玩的。
Zhang Shuo told them that he bought the game to play with you.
父母不以为然，觉得自己这么大的人了，还玩什么游戏。
The parents disapprove, feel oneself so big person, still play what kind of game.
张朔反驳：现在的人不就是越老越像小孩吗？。
Zhang Shuo retorts: is not the person now more old like a child?
2月9日下午，母亲在电视盒子里看完了《养母的花样年华》最后一集，和父亲一起坐在沙发上玩手机。
On the afternoon of Feb. 9, my mother finished watching the last episode of "My adoptive mother's love life" on the TV box, sitting on the couch playing with her father.
张朔意识到，机会来了。
Zhang Shuo realized that the opportunity had come.
他赶紧掏出《璀璨宝石》，招呼父母：玩手机有什么意思，来玩游戏吧！。
He hurriedly took out "resplendent gem", accosted parents: What is the meaning of playing mobile phone, come to play games!
父亲借口抽烟溜走了，母亲看上去还有些兴趣。
Father slipped away on the pretext of smoking, and my mother seemed interested.
张朔把卡牌和配件一一摆上桌子，向母亲讲解规则。
Zhang Shuo put the cards and accessories on the table to explain the rules to his mother.
《璀璨宝石》规则简单，收集卡牌和筹码的玩法又和老一辈人爱玩的扑克、麻将有些相似，更容易让他们接受。
"Resplendent gemstones" simple rules, card and chip collection and the old generation like playing poker, mahjong, easier to accept them.
在桌游爱好者圈子里，《璀璨宝石》一直是最适合推荐长辈的游戏之一。
Among desktop lovers, Resplendent Gems has always been one of the most appropriate games to recommend elders.
。
.
这只是一方面。
This is only one aspect.
张朔总结，和父母一起玩游戏，简单、轻松确实重要，但更重要的是态度。
Zhang Shuo summed up, playing games with parents, simple, relaxed really important, but more important is the attitude.
“最初我只讲一些最基本的规则，然后在游戏过程中慢慢告诉她，你还可以这样做，你还可以那样做。
"At first I'll just say the most basic rules and then slowly tell her in the middle of the game that you can do that and you can do that.
”张朔说，要让父母感觉到，你是在和他们一起研究规则，一起进步，而不是居高临下指点他们。
"Zhang Shuo said that to let parents feel that you are working with them to study the rules, progress together, rather than commanding them.
。
.
小技巧当然也很重要。
Tips are also important.
张朔小声说，自己在第一局里放水了。
Zhang Shuo whispered that he had put water in the first innings.
玩到一半，父亲忍不住来看热闹，张朔趁机给他讲了讲规则。
In the middle of the play, father could not help but come to see lively, Zhang Shuo took the opportunity to tell him the rules.
这时母亲不乐意了，催促他：你倒是快点拿牌呀！。
At this time his mother did not like, urging him: you are quick to hold cards.
张朔的母亲正在认真研究《璀璨宝石》。
Zhang Shuo's mother is studying Resplendent Gems seriously.
一局结束，母亲以1分险胜。
At the end of the game, mother narrowly won.
张朔心里有些惴惴不安，母亲还会继续玩吗？她是真的想玩，还是不想让我不高兴，勉强陪我玩了一局？他的手按在桌面上，迟迟抬不起来。
Zhang Shuo is a little nervous, mother will continue to play? Is she really want to play, or do not want me unhappy, forced to play with me a round? His hands on the table, holding up.
但母亲似乎没有注意到，她拿起牌，随意洗了洗，按照规则重新摆好，然后对儿子说，我们再来一局吧。
But the mother did not seem to notice. She picked up the cards, washed them at random, arranged them according to the rules, and then said to her son, Let's have another round.
。
.
那一刻，张朔有点想哭。
That moment, Zhang Shuo a little want to cry.
。
.
“我看到我妈手里攥着一把Token，埋头认真思考下一步应该怎么做的时候，心里的感觉真的难以形容，就像在一个平行时空里，眼前都是不真实的。
"When I saw my mother holding Token in her hand and pondering what to do next, the feeling in my heart was unspeakable, as if it were unreal in a parallel space-time.
”张朔想起了父亲对他说过的一些事。
"Zhang Shuo remembered what his father had said to him.
在更严苛的环境里，父母从小接受的教育是，要早早自立，十几岁就得赚钱养家，娱乐永远排在生存之后。
In harsher environments, parents are taught from an early age to stand on their own feet, earn a living as a teenager, and play is always second to survival.
张朔觉得，很多时候，父母不是厌恶游戏，只是他们的成长环境让他们排斥一切不“实用”的东西。
Zhang Shuo thinks, a lot of times, the parents are not loathe the game, just their growing up environment lets them reject everything not "practical" thing.
。
.
■ 改变。
▪ Changes.
疫情期间，社交平台一度流行一种说法：很多人平时嘴里说自己“宅”，其实只是伪宅，一旦真的隔离了，就总想着出门；现在还能安然待在家里的才是真宅。
During the epidemic, it was once fashionable for social platforms to say that many people said they were "homesteads," that they were fake homes, and that once they were really isolated, they always wanted to go out.
还有人说，这是“宅”们光明正大为国家做贡献的机会。
Others say it is an opportunity for homeowners to contribute openly and honestly to the country.
。
.
小虹觉得自己是个真宅。
Little Hong thinks she's a real house.
几周不出门不是大问题，即使没有疫情，她也不爱参加蹦迪、唱K之类的社交活动。
A few weeks away from home is not a big problem, even if there is no epidemic, she does not like to participate in bungee jumping, singing K and other social activities.
相比之下，她更怀念外卖奶茶，“喝不到‘一点点’和‘COCO’我要死了。
By contrast, she'd miss takeaway milk tea, "not a little 'and' COCO 'I'm dying.
”她说。
'she said.
。
.
真正受影响的，是她的工作。
It's her job that's really affected.
小虹在大学里读旅游与酒店管理专业，如果疫情没有发生，她应该正忙着实习。
Xiao Hong studied tourism and hotel management at the university. If the outbreak did not happen, she should be busy practicing.
然而现在，旅游已经成为受影响最直接、最严重的行业之一。
Now, however, tourism has become one of the most direct and serious industries affected.
。
.
人群不许聚集，景点关闭，酒店停业，餐馆收歇……小虹说，这种影响是环环相扣的。
Crowds are not allowed to congregate, attractions are closed, hotels are closed and restaurants are closed.
不止国内，还有不少国家对出入境作出了限制。
Not only at home, but also in a number of countries on entry and exit restrictions.
这让小虹感觉到，至少今年上半年，旅游业的发展不会太好。
This let Hong feel, at least in the first half of this year, tourism development will not be too good.
。
.
这对她个人意味着什么，小虹还没有想过。
Little Hong had not thought of what it would mean for her personally.
。
.
小家庭里，改变也悄然发生。
In small families, change also happens quietly.
自从回到泉州，每晚吃饭，张朔都要陪父亲喝点儿酒。
Since returning to Quanzhou, every night eat, Zhang Shuo to accompany his father to drink some wine.
。
.
福建是个特别的地方。
Fujian is a special place.
早年间“下南洋”的习俗和如今的“北漂”相互碰撞，让两代人之间的关系变得微妙起来。
The early years of the "southern" custom and now "north drift" collide, so that the relationship between the two generations become delicate.
张朔的爷爷年轻时去过新加坡，父母也在他三四岁的时候去了中国香港地区；等到他成年，父母希望他留在泉州，找个稳定的工作，结婚生孩子，但他又不愿意，一个人跑到北京工作。
When he was three or four years old, his parents went to Hong Kong, China. When he was an adult, his parents wanted him to stay in Quanzhou, find a stable job, marry and have children.
“小的时候，我在家里留守，长大了，父母在家里留守。
"When I was young, I stayed at home, grew up, my parents stayed at home.
”张朔说，我一直没有和父母建立起紧密的联系。
Zhang Shuo said that I had not been able to establish close contact with my parents.
。
.
但父亲总是盼着儿子回家。
But the father always looked forward to his son coming home.
张朔的父亲喜欢喝酒，每天晚饭时习惯倒上半杯白酒，自斟自饮。
Zhang Shuo's father likes to drink, every night at dinner, used to pour half a cup of white wine, drink their own.
儿子回家，他非常高兴，终于有人陪他喝喝酒、说说话了。
When his son came home, he was so happy that someone was at last with him drinking and talking.
如果一个人喝，他总觉得那半杯酒怎么也喝不完。
If a man drinks, he feels as if he can't finish that half of the wine.
张朔喝不惯白酒，父亲特地给他开了一瓶八几年的人头马。
Zhang Shuo can not get used to liquor, his father specially gave him a bottle of more than eighty years of human head horse.
。
.
酒瓶很快见了底。
The bottle soon bottomed out.
在酒精和时间的催化下，父亲和儿子谈了很多过去的事。
Catalysed by alcohol and time, my father and son talked a lot about the past.
张朔说，这是父亲第一次告诉他，爷爷当年为什么要去新加坡，他们年轻时在香港过着怎样的生活。
This was the first time his father had told him why Grandpa had gone to Singapore and what kind of life they had in Hong Kong when they were young, Zhang said.
他也第一次真诚地告诉父亲，这种互相留守的经历给他造成过多大的伤害。
For the first time, he told his father in good faith how much damage the experience of staying behind had done him.
听他说起这些，父亲恍然大悟：原来孩子成长中发生了这么多事，他竟然一点儿都不知道。
As he said this, his father realized that he had no idea what had happened to the child as he had grown up.
。
.
“沟通多了，对立、矛盾、隔膜什么的就少了。
"Communication is much, antagonism, contradiction, diaphragm and so on are few.
”张朔觉得，虽然有些传统观念很难改变，但他父母还属于那种“能沟通”的，比起那些完全陷入原生家庭阴影的朋友，他已经很幸运了。
"Zhang Shuo thinks that while some traditional attitudes are hard to change, his parents are still the kind of" communicative "type of person who is lucky enough to be stuck in the shadows of his native family.
。
.
“我这样说可能不太好，”张朔仔细斟酌着用词，“疫情、隔离，这些事情对于整体而言是个灾难，但在我们这种没有被实际波及的小家庭里，这是一个大家坐下来好好沟通，尝试体验新东西的机会。
"It may not be good for me to say this," Zhang Shuo thought carefully. "Outbreak, isolation, these things are a disaster for the whole, but in a small family like ours, which is not actually affected, it is an opportunity for everyone to sit down and try something new.
”正是因为不能上班，不用考虑赚钱养家的事，父母才能单纯地坐下来，和儿子一起玩一个游戏。
Just because they can't come to work and think about making money to support their families, parents can simply sit down and play a game with their son.
。
.
张朔保留的一张老照片，是与爷爷、奶奶、姑姑、妹妹、堂妹们的合影，他回忆，自己小时候几乎没和父母一起拍过照片。
Zhang Shuo kept an old photo with his grandfather, grandmother, aunt, sister, cousin, he recalled that he almost did not take photos with his parents when he was a child.
游戏的意义可能有很多。
The game may have many meanings.
张朔说，其中很关键的一个，是帮助人们建立起情感上的联系。
Zhang Shuo said that one of the key is to help people build emotional ties.
孩子与父母，丈夫与妻子，他们出于各种原因，在人生的前半段错过了，但仍然可以从现在开始，坐在桌子前，用游戏来了解彼此。
Children and parents, husbands and wives, for a variety of reasons, miss out on the first half of their lives, but can still sit at a table and learn about each other from now on.
。
.
张朔又回忆起他的童年时代：父母远在香港，留他和爷爷奶奶一起生活，老人很疼他，但工作也很忙，没法及时去学校接他放学。
Zhang Shuo recalled his childhood: his parents were far away in Hong Kong, leaving him to live with his grandparents. The old man loved him very much, but he was too busy to pick him up in time for school.
上小学时，他每天眼睁睁看着同学们一个一个离开，灯一盏一盏熄灭，他一个人躺在一张露天的乒乓球桌上，继续等待，直到天完全变黑，星星和月亮悬在头顶，才能看到爷爷骑着一辆小自行车，晃晃悠悠地到校门口找他。
When he was in elementary school, he watched his classmates leave one by one, the lights went out, and he lay alone on an open ping-pong table, waiting until it was completely dark and the stars and the moon were hanging overhead, before he could see Grandpa riding a small bicycle and looking for him at the school gate.
当时他就觉得，虽然我住在这个地方，但我和这个地方一点关系也没有。
It seemed to him at the time that, though I lived here, I had nothing to do with the place.
。
.
如今，张朔不断尝试理解父母。
Today, Zhang Shuo is constantly trying to understand his parents.
他意识到，有些事情是改变不了的，我们可能永远也等不到父母理解自己，那么只有开始理解父母，彼此的关系才可能有转机。
He realized that there are things that can't be changed, that we may never be able to wait for our parents to understand us, and that it is only when we begin to understand our parents that there is a chance for a better relationship.
。
.
这个转机可能是一杯酒，一场谈话，也可能是一个游戏。
The turnaround could be a glass of wine, a conversation, or a game.
“最重要的是沟通。
"The most important thing is communication.
”张朔说，所谓沟通不是把父母当成敌人，用伪装去查探他们的想法，而是要发自内心地互相了解。
"Communication is not about seeing parents as enemies, checking their thoughts in disguise, but about getting to know each other from the heart," Zhang said.
他承认，自己以前有过功利性的妥协，为了让父母少管他，少催婚，他说过许多言不由衷的话。
He admitted that he had made utilitarian compromises before, and he had said many things he didn't really want his parents to take care of him and get married less.
。
.
但和父亲喝过酒，和母亲玩过桌游之后，张朔觉得，“我真的可以和他们沟通了”。
But after drinking with his father and playing table games with his mother, Zhang Shuo felt, "I can really communicate with them."
