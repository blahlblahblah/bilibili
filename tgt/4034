本文是协作者在“农民工抗疫救援行动”中，针对困境农民工家庭开展的个案访谈之一，旨在快速识别疫情中的脆弱人群及其需求，为疫情防控和救援工作提供参考，我们整理出来与你分享。

疫情下的深呼吸——困境农民工家庭个案实录（六）没办法，得出去啊口述者：阿光（化名）/河南籍打工所在地：珠海编者注：阿光，39岁。
There is no way out! Oral: A Guang (not his real name) / Henan working place: Zhuhai Editor's Note: Ah Guang, 39.
早年辍学，16岁外出打工，做了多年的苦力，后来到珠海进了一家外企电子厂，在流水线上做普工，已经干了近10年。
After dropping out of school at an early age, working outside at the age of 16 and doing many years of drudgery, he went to Zhuhai to enter a foreign-owned electronics factory to do universal work on the assembly line, has been working for nearly 10 years.
家里有两个孩子，都跟着媳妇在河南老家上小学，家里就靠着着阿光在外打工的工资养家。
The family has two children, all with his daughter-in-law in Henan home to primary school, the family relies on Ah Guang's wages to work outside to support the family.
谁都知道城市的教育比农村的好，但是没有办法我大概５岁时，父母外出都不跟我联系了，我就跟着爷爷生活。
Everyone knows that education in the city is better than in the countryside, but there's no way I can. When I was about five years old, my parents didn't even get in touch with me anymore.
爷爷去世后，我又只好跟着叔叔生活长大。
After Grandpa died, I had to live with my uncle again.
小时候，叔叔也是靠卖鞋底、收破烂和种几亩地生活，加上叔叔家也有两个孩子，所以我们没钱上学。
When I was young, my uncle lived on the soles, rags, and acres of land, and my uncle had two children, so we didn't have the money to go to school.
因为没钱缴学费，那时候我还被学校赶出来过，也不想欠学校的学费，没办法，就不去上了。
Because I did not have the money to pay tuition fees, I was thrown out of school at that time, do not want to owe the school tuition fees, there is no way, do not go.
我父亲前些年去世前还回来老家几天，去世的时候，我专门从外地回去把他的骨灰带回老家安葬了。
When my father came home a few days before he died, I returned home from a special place to bury his ashes.
说实话，我现在都不记得我爸爸长什么样子。
Honestly, I don't even remember what my dad looked like right now.
▲ 阿光在珠海协作者做志愿服务（拍摄于2018年3月）我是16岁开始外出打工，刚出来是在工地上、砖场等地方做，也去过北京，江苏等地，大部分都是在工地上做，还去过深圳的电子厂做普工（普通工人），后来到了珠海，就一直在一家电子厂做。
Ah Guang volunteered at Zhuhai Association (filmed in March 2018) I began to work at the age of 16, just came out of the construction site, brick farms, and other places, also visited Beijing, Jiangsu and other places, most of the construction site, has also been to Shenzhen electronics factories (ordinary workers), and later in Zhuhai, has been in an electronics factory.
后来结婚生子，只有女儿一个孩子时，还能在珠海上个幼儿园，后来儿子出生，我一个人赚钱养家在珠海开支大，消费不起，老婆和孩子就只能先回老家了，留下我一个人在珠海打工。
Later, when my son was born, I made a living by myself. In Zhuhai, I could not afford to spend money on my family. So my wife and children had to go back to my hometown and work alone in Zhuhai.
谁都知道城市的教育比农村的好，但是没有办法。
Everyone knows that education in the city is better than in the countryside, but there is no other way.
如果持续好几个月，我们的生活就没法办了2020年１月16日，我一个人从珠海坐高铁到广州东，从广州坐火车回老家过年。
If it lasts for several months, our lives will be impossible. On January 16, 2020, I took a high-speed train from Zhuhai to Guangzhou East.
从广东到老家没有高铁，我坐了24个小时的硬座。
There was no high-speed rail from Guangdong to my hometown. I sat on the hard seat for 24 hours.
火车票很难买，回家前我都是每天盯着手机抢票，因为火车票便宜，177.5元，也为了省点钱，如果坐大巴车600-700元，就比较贵。
Rail tickets are hard to buy, and I always stare at them every day before I go home, because they are cheap, 177.5 yuan, and to save money, they are more expensive if you take the bus, 600-700 yuan.
我回家时还没有听说疫情的事情，到大年初一才听说，当时村里拉了红色的横幅，还通过大喇叭宣传说疫情，让大家不要外出。
I had not heard of the outbreak when I returned home, until the New Year's Day, when the village played a red banner, but also through the loudspeaker to spread the epidemic, let us not go out.
当时我心中有点郁闷，感觉像“非典”一样，大家都是提心吊胆的，买东西都是戴口罩，因为有传染性，感觉比“非典”还厉害。
At that time, I was a little depressed, like "SARS", we are afraid to buy things are wearing masks, because of infectious, feeling more severe than "SARS.
记得“非典”是天气热的时候发生的，那时我在深圳的工厂上班，每天也都是要带口罩，没什么其他制约，但是目前整个村庄都静悄悄地，网上很多人也说感觉像坐牢一样。
I remember when SARS happened in hot weather, when I worked at my factory in Shenzhen and wore masks every day. There were no other restrictions, but the whole village was quiet and many people on the Internet said they felt like they were in jail.
因为在农村，没有消毒之类的东西。
Because in the countryside, there is no disinfection or anything like that.
我们村里就只有一个很小的药店。
There is only one small drugstore in our village.
大家出门就要戴好口罩，但目前我家里也已经没有口罩了，还是媳妇去邻居家借了２个回来，出门时可以使用。
We have to wear masks when we go out, but at present my family no longer have masks, or a daughter-in-law to borrow two neighbors back, can be used when they go out.
孩子们也没有口罩，就让他们天天在家呆着，提醒他们多洗手。
Children do not have masks, so they stay at home every day to remind them to wash their hands more often.
阿光老家村口的防疫人员（拍摄于2020年2月，摄/阿光）谁都不想有这种事情发生，我心里还是有些小怕。
Anguang hometown village vaccination personnel (filmed in February 2020, photo / A Guang) No one wants this to happen, I still a little afraid.
我现在看到陌生人，都会尽量离得远远的，感觉每个人都会受到影响。
I now see strangers, will try to stay away from each other, feel that everyone will be affected.
孩子们对这些还不太了解，我们大人都还不太清楚。
The children don't know much about this, and we adults don't know much about it.
孩子们有时候觉得无聊，我就陪他们看看书，听一下音乐，陪他们玩一玩。
Children sometimes feel bored, I accompany them to read, listen to music, and play with them.
家里人也都不怎么出门。
The family did not go out much either.
如果没有这次的病，大家都开开心心过年，可以串门，去逛逛，但出了这个事情，大家都是呆家里面。
If not for this disease, we are happy New Year, can visit, but out of this matter, everyone is a fool inside.
现在超市有时开门，有时不开，年前集市还有人，现在都是静悄悄的。
Supermarkets now open sometimes, sometimes not, and there were people at the fair years ago, and now they are quiet.
这次疫情，持续一两个月，对我们影响就还不大，让我们能上街买东西就可以，目前我家快没有馒头和菜吃了，因为都是年前买了一些，疫情出来就不许开集市，买不了。
This epidemic, lasting for a month or two, will have little impact on us. Let us go shopping. At present, there is no steamed bread or vegetables in my home.
如果持续好几个月或半年，我们的生活就没法办了，不止我一家，而是很多家庭都经不起，时间太长，家里也没有那么多存款了，现在我就想着什么时候去上班。
If it lasted for months or six months, our lives would be out of order. Not just my family, but many families could not afford it.
儿子在汽车后面追着一路跑……但是没办法，得出去啊我心里的愿望就是希望孩子们在家里学习好，成绩优秀一点就好了。
My son is running all the way behind the car... but there's no way out. My wish is that the children study well at home and do well.
孩子的学习让我比较头疼，我知道老师、家长双方也都有责任，我们文化程度不高，都是小学文化，也是没办法。
The child's study lets me compare headache, I know the teacher, the parents both also have the responsibility, our education level is not high, are primary school culture, is also unable to do.
孩子们写作业遇到问题，有时候问邻居家的孩子，或邻居家当老师的人，要么就是回学校问老师，有时候就是微信问老师怎么解题，再把方法教给孩子。
Children have problems with homework. Sometimes they ask a neighbor's child, or a neighbor's teacher, or they go back to school and ask the teacher how to solve the problem.
为了和孩子多联系，近5年来，我通常是在过年时回家，但平时家里有事情也会回。
In order to keep in touch with my children, I usually come home during the New Year, but I usually get things back at home.
如果过年买不到火车票，只有大巴车票，太贵了也就不回了。
If the Spring Festival can not buy train tickets, only bus tickets, too expensive will not be returned.
在珠海工作时，一般２到３天就会跟孩子们视频聊天，有时候孩子自己就打过来了。
When I work in Zhuhai, I usually have a video chat with my children in 2-3 days. Sometimes the kids call me.
每次回家看望孩子，再回珠海时，孩子们都是泪眼汪汪的。
Every time I go home to see my children and then back to Zhuhai, the children are tearful.
有一次，我到镇上坐车去市里搭火车，儿子就在汽车后面追着一路跑，媳妇也在后面追着孩子跑，那时很难过的，但是没办法，得出去啊。
Once, when I was taking a bus to town to catch the train, my son was running after the car, and my daughter-in-law was running after the children.
目前在家里，农村也没什么地可以种，因为国家南水北调，村里的地都要搞绿化。
At present at home, the countryside can not be planted, because the country's south-to-north water transfer, the village land should be greening.
土地被承包了，我家只有两亩地可以种，承包土地补贴的钱一年也就3000元左右，还不能按时发，没办法，只能出去打工。
The land was contracted, my family only two acres of land can be planted, the money that contracts land subsidy also is about 3000 yuan a year, still cannot send on time, have no choice but to work outside.
孩子前些年生病，家里也欠下了一些债务，但这些年还了一些，还有几万块。
The children were ill a few years ago, and the family had some debts, but they paid some back over the years, and tens of thousands more.
我目前没有什么技能，也没什么文化，在工厂干了一年又一年，真不知道以后还能干什么，也还没什么打算，想做点什么，也没有资本。
I don't have much skills, I don't know what I can do, I don't have any plans, I don't have any capital, I don't know what I can do.
希望疫情早点过去，一切都会好起来。
Hopefully the outbreak will be over and everything will be okay.
社会工作者手记访谈过程中，阿光说的最多的一句话就是“没办法”。
Social workers in the manual interview process, A Guang said the most one sentence is "no way."
但能感觉到，从小没有爸爸妈妈呵护的他，对现在的家充满依恋和责任。
But can feel, there is no father and mother to care for him since childhood, on the current home full of attachment and responsibility.
尽管自己没上过几天学，但他希望孩子都能学习好；尽管他说自己没有一技之长，但他尽自己所能挣钱养家。
Although he had not attended school for a few days, he wanted his children to study well and, although he said he had no skills, he did his best to earn money to support his family.
为了生存，阿光不得不承受承受长期和家人分离的苦痛。
To survive, Ah Guang had to endure a long separation from his family.
突发的疫情，阻挡了阿光返程工作，也阻挡了这个家唯一的经济来源。
The sudden outbreak of the disease, blocked the work of Ah Guang return, but also blocked the family's only financial resources.
阿光并不知道未来在哪里，但他依然相信：疫情过去，一切都会好起。
Ah Guang did not know where the future lay, but he still believed that everything would be okay once the epidemic was over.
