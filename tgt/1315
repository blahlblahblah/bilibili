律师表示，若自如行为属实，租客应为自己维权赶在封城前坐上火车离开，通过体温测量顺利进京后又住进小区，但湖北人小王没想到自己在隔离期间，却要搬家。
Lawyer said if the act is true, the tenant should be in front of their rights in front of the train to leave, through temperature measurement into the smooth after living in the community, but Hubei people Xiao Wang did not expect to be in isolation, but had to move.
让他搬家的是自如。
It's all right to let him move.
续约涨价，未能提供服务但正常收取服务费，不同意无法返回的租客无责退房，让湖北籍租客无责换整租房子……近期以来，自如因这些举动饱受批评和质疑，租客们指摘自如在疫情期间“坐地起价”。
Renewing the contract, failing to provide services but charging a normal service fee, renters who do not agree to return have no responsibility to check out, leaving Hubei tenants with no responsibility to change their tenancies.
湖北籍租客：隔离期雪夜搬家，无法以“不可抗力”无责退租“只能整租是吗？自如没有任何的补助政策对吗？”2月6日下午，老家在湖北十堰的自如客小王在北京朝阳区租处接到了一名自如地区经理的电话，要求他换到一个整租房子，差价自己出，或暂时搬到一个整租房子里隔离14天。
2007-9-19 15: 16 Hubei tenant: isolation period snow night move, can not be "force majeure" no responsibility to rent back "can only rent?
小王告诉中国新闻周刊，自如给的理由是他“从湖北回来的”。
Xiao Wang told China News Weekly that the reason he could give freely was that he "came back from Hubei".
“你不同意也没办法，会被强制。
"You don't agree and you can't. You're forced.
”该经理称可以通过云端锁上小王的密码门。
The manager said Xiao Wang's password could be locked through the cloud.
联想到自如1月30日给租客下发通知，要求所有用户2月1日前线上提报最近居留地、个人健康、返程日期等信息，逾期将被“暂时收回居住房屋的智能门锁权限”，小王很生气。
Wang was angry with the company for issuing a notice to tenants on Jan. 30 asking all users to report on the front line on February 1 information about their last reservation, personal health, date of return, etc.
他觉得自己的私权被侵犯，“在合同期内，自如作为一个中介是否有权利去对我暂时拥有居住权的房子进行强制干涉？”此时，已是他在家隔离的第10天。
He felt that his private rights had been infringed, and that it was the tenth day of his isolation that he had the right to intervene compulsorily, as an intermediary, in the house where I had the temporary right of abode for the duration of the contract.
1月27日，他顺利出火车站进入小区，体温正常，被物业要求在家自我隔离14天。
On January 27, he successfully left the train station into the community, the temperature is normal, the property was asked to isolate themselves at home for 14 days.
合租房内就他一人，2位室友会在他隔离期结束左右回来。
He is the only one in the shared room and the two roommates will return around the end of his isolation period.
小王告诉中国新闻周刊，通话时他录了音，挂电话后他陆续报警，联系媒体，咨询了律师。
Xiao Wang told China News that he taped the phone, hung up the phone, called the police, contacted the media, and consulted a lawyer.
律师告诉他自如此举是违法的，如果自如实施了强制措施会帮他打官司。
The lawyer told him it was illegal for him to do so freely, and that the use of coercive measures would have helped him file a lawsuit.
随后，他将自己采取的这些措施用文字发在了小区的自如客微信群里，并愤然表达自己的反对意见。
Subsequently, he took these measures in writing in the community at ease in the micro-letter group, and angrily expressed their opposition.
但自如的操作令他始料未及。
But the ease with which he operated surprised him.
“他们给我俩室友打电话，让他们不要回来，或者回来后搬到别的房子里去。
"They called our roommates and told them not to come back or move to another house when they got back.
”不想因为自己的事麻烦别人，他选择妥协，搬到自如安排的整租房子内隔离。
"Rather than bothering others about his own affairs, he made a compromise and moved to a freely arranged segregation in a rented house.
2月6日，北京大雪。
February 6th, heavy snow in Beijing.
当晚22:00左右，小王独自拉着行李箱踏着积雪赶到了自如提供的某一居室里。
At about 22: 00 that evening, Xiao Wang walked through the snow with his suitcase to one of the bedrooms he was comfortable providing.
但和自如APP显示的普通一居室不同，小王称他落脚的地方是个二居室隔断，也没有电视机、沙发等物品。
But unlike the ordinary one-bedroom display of a comfortable APP, Wang said he settled in a two-bedroom block, with no television sets, sofas or anything.
而自如只告知他新住处地址和密码，并未告知他需要带上棉被等生活物品，小王称没办法住。
But so as to tell him the new address and password, did not tell him to take quilts and other living things, Wang said there is no way to live.
自如安排给小王的隔离整租卧室。
Easy to arrange the isolation room for Xiao Wang.
图/受访者提供视频截图“我后来想想不对，而且另外两个室友回复我说他们10号以后回。
Photo / interviewee provides a video screenshot "I didn't think about it later, and two other roommates replied that they would come back after the 10th.
”小王当夜又拉着行李箱返回了原住处。
That night Xiao Wang returned to his place of residence, carrying his suitcase.
而这一次夭折的搬家，让他感冒了。
But this time abortive move, let him catch a cold.
“但让我这样还在隔离期的人乱跑，我也是服气自如。
"But let me still in isolation of the people running around, I am also comfortable with the air.
”此后，自如管家再未联系他。
Since then the housekeeper has not been contacted again.
“病毒是通过户籍传染的吗？”除了认为自己的正当权益被侵犯，小王还觉得自己作为湖北人被歧视了。
"Is the virus transmitted through household registration?" In addition to thinking that his legitimate rights and interests were violated, Wang also felt discriminated against as a Hubei.
因为湖北人身份受到影响的自如客不只他一人。
He was not alone in being affected by Hubei people's identity.
小王告诉中国新闻周刊，其所在的租客群内有一名武汉人，因封城无法按期返京，但被自如要求正常交房租，“一个月房租5500块。
Wang told China News Weekly that a Wuhan resident of his tenant group, who was unable to return to Beijing on time due to the closure of the city, had been able to demand normal rent, "rent 5,500 a month.
”“自如否认当前武汉暴发的疫情，交通管制属于（租房合同中所说的合同可自行解除的）不可抗力。
"So far as to deny the current outbreak of Wuhan, traffic control is a force majeure (the contract in the rental contract is self-liquidating).
”汤敏（化名）是在北京工作的武汉人，租住在东城区和平里的安外花园，每个月的房租加上服务费、利息共6821.75元。
Tang Min (not his real name) is a Wuhan native who works in Beijing and rents an Anhui garden in peace in Dongcheng District.
因武汉封城，她至今未能回京。
She has not been able to return to Beijing since Wuhan was closed.
自如针对武汉地区的房源提供了2月房租减免50%的优惠，此前对武汉籍在外地租房的租客并未有相关措施。
Wuhan against the region to provide a rent relief of 50% discount in February, the previous Wuhan-based tenants in the non-local rental there has no relevant measures.
2月1日左右，她联系管家称想退租，但对方称她是单方面违约，需要缴纳违约金。
Around 1 February, she contacted the housekeeper and said that she wanted to return the rent, but the other party claimed that she had unilaterally breached the contract and had to pay the penalty.
并称如果要解约，需要她将个人的行李物品全部搬走。
She also said she would need to remove all her personal belongings if she wanted to cancel her contract.

但她同时拨通了北京12345政府服务热线。
But she also dialed Beijing's 12345 government service hotline.
2月10日，投诉得到了管家的回应：“关于您的诉求我们目前只能满足两点：一个是给您办理无责退租，一个是协助您的朋友帮您收拾行李物品。
On February 10, the housekeeper responded to the complaint: "We can only satisfy two things about your claim at the moment: one is to give you a rent-free refund and the other is to assist your friend in packing your luggage.
”“行李没办法处理，自如不能帮忙寄存（行李），也不减免房租”，汤敏对中国新闻周刊说，她只能等疫情稳定再去办理退租。
"There's no way she can handle it, she can't help with her luggage, she can't relieve her rent," she told China News Weekly.
自如：涨价是“极个例”问题远不止这些。
Easy: Rise prices are a "rare case" problem.
多名租客在网上发声，称自如利用疫情期间租客不便搬家、还未到复工时间等特殊性，大面积多地区哄抬租金，续租普遍增长10%-30%。
A number of tenants on the Internet, said that during the epidemic period tenants do not easily move, not to return to work and other special characteristics, large areas of rent, renewal of rent generally increased by 10% to 30%.
自如官网显示，自如客有近300万人。
According to the website, there are nearly three million people at ease.
面对舆论压力，自如2月10日回应称“已经跟进到租客，多是因长租客想改为短期续约引起，与租客基本达成共识”。
"We have followed up with tenants, mostly because the long-term tenants want to renew their tenancies for a short period of time and have basically reached a consensus with the tenants," the spokesman said.
自如CEO熊林也在朋友圈称，“自如客户续约价格出现大的波动是极个例情况”。
Xiong Lin, a comfortable CEO, also said in his circle of friends that "big fluctuations in the price of a freely renewed customer are a rare case."
因为舆情汹涌，熊林的个人认证微博关闭了评论，其曾于2月1日表示，“听到所有的声音，大家庭，事情一件一件去解决”。
"Listen to all voices, big families, one thing at a time," Xiong Lin's personal attestation Weibo, which closed its comments on Feb. 1, said.
但租客对此不买账。
But the tenant did not buy it.
“没有共识，只有自如单方面的强制定价。
"There is no consensus, only unilateral coercive pricing.
”“作为长租客户，刚续约被涨价15%。
"As a long-term tenant, the new contract has been raised by 15 per cent.
”“疫情当头，盘剥租户。
"The epidemic is under way, exploiting the tenants.
”南京的自如客小鱼（化名）就遭遇了涨价。
Nanjing residents of the small fish (alias) on the rise.
她是长租1年、续约1年，“我是老用户，加上自如信用分达到标准，续租的服务费打63折，但房租涨了5%。
"I'm a regular user, and with a good credit rating of up to 63% off the renewal fee, but the rent is up 5%.
”小鱼称，年前她曾咨询管家续约的问题，对方称续租的话租金不变。
Fisher said she had asked about the housekeeper's renewal a year ago and said the rent would remain the same.
但年后，却被告知系统变更，租金上调了。
Three years later, however, he was told that the system had changed and the rent had been increased.
服务暂停却照收服务费也是众多自如客不满之处。
The suspension of services and the charging of service charges are also a source of dissatisfaction for many customers.
小鱼称，自己的租房已近一个月没有上门保洁。
Small fish said that their rental has not been a month door-to-door cleaning.
而服务费已在签合同时一次结清，是全年房租的10%。
The service charge, which is 10 per cent of the full year's rent, was settled at the time the contract was signed.
北京的自如租客阿哲同时也是3个维权群群主，群成员近1000人。
Beijing's easy tenant Acer is also a group of three rights groups, the members of the group of nearly 1,000 people.
他告诉中国新闻周刊，他们遭遇的问题基本相似，诉求包括减少房租，退还无法提供服务期间的服务费，续租涨幅不超过3%，无责退租以及疫情期间不强制要求搬家等。
He told China News that the problems they encountered were basically similar, ranging from rent reductions to service charges for periods when services could not be provided, rent increases of up to 3 per cent, rent refunds and no mandatory moves during the outbreak.
但阿哲表示，目前没有一个维权成功的。
But Mr Acre says none has been successful so far.
2月11日，中国新闻周刊就上述问题拨通了自如客服电话，系统提示音称“受疫情影响，自如客服放假至16日”；当日给自如官网公布的媒体联系邮箱发出采访请求，至今未收到回复。
On Feb. 11, China News Weekly dialed a comfortable customer service phone number on the above-mentioned issue. The system was prompted to say: "Affected by the epidemic situation, free customer service holiday to 16," the same day to the media posted by the website of interview request, so far no response.
2月12日，自如发文称为因疫情导致无法如期返回租住城市又到了续约期的自如客推出一个月灵活选择，为2020年3月1日后返回并继续居住的租客减免2月全月服务费。
On 12 February, a one-month flexible option was introduced for tenants who had returned and continued to reside after 1 March 2020, claiming that they had been unable to return to their rental cities on schedule because of the outbreak and had reached the renewal period.
关于无责退租方面，届时向因疫情导致2020年3月1日后还无法返回租住城市并暂时不考虑继续居住的自如客办理。
With regard to non-refundable rent, it will be available to those who have not been able to return to rental cities after 1 March 2020 due to the outbreak and who are temporarily excluded from consideration for continued residence.
在小鱼看来，“这个声明没有说明之前租期到了，已经不得已短期续约的租客的损失如何退回。
"The statement does not state how the tenant's losses, which have had to be renewed for a short period, will be refunded," Fisher said.
”小王看到声明后联系了管家，对方直言“现在不知道如何去界定这个3月1号，万一说只针对湖北地区呢？要证明呢？……”。
"Xiao Wang saw the statement and contacted the housekeeper." I don't know how to define this March 1, but what if it is only for Hubei? "
当天，小王被告知可以无责退租，地区经理让他不要在群里说此事，因为他是个例，“原则上不可以（无责退租）”。
On the same day, Xiao Wang was told that he was not responsible for renting the apartment. The district manager told him not to talk about it in the group because he was an exception.
律师：租客应勇于维权秦兵房产律师团队律师张皓然和广西广正大律师事务所律师雷家茂接受中国新闻周刊采访时均表示，如租户所言属实，自如的部分行为并非合理合法，租户可发声维权，相关部门应加强监管。
Lawyer: Tenants should be brave enough to defend their rights. Zhang Haoran, a lawyer working for Qin Bing Real Estate, and Lei Jiaomeo, a lawyer at Guangxi Guang Zhengda Law Firm, told China News Weekly that if the tenant's claims are true and some of the acts are not legitimate, the tenant can advocate his rights.
在湖北籍租客小王隔离期间被自如要求换到整租房子一事上，张皓然认为，非常时期原来的租房合同仍旧有效。
Hubei tenants during the isolation of Xiao Wang was easily asked to change to a full house, Zhang HaoRan that the original rental contract is still valid.
而小王被要求搬到整租房子后需付与合租卧室之间的差价，小王完全可以不同意，且自如不得以此为由解除合同。
Xiao Wang was asked to move to the whole house and pay the difference between the two bedrooms, Wang can completely disagree, and can not be used to terminate the contract.
自如给小王提供的第二种选择为搬到整租房子内隔离，只需支付原来合租卧室的房租。
The second option that Xiao Wang can easily offer is to move to a rented house in isolation, paying only the rent for the shared bedroom.
张皓然表示，自如供租客进行短期隔离的场所应与原房源在同一小区且该场所应当经过全面消毒。
Hao Ran said that the site should be located in the same area as the original house and that the site should be completely sterilized.
此外，按照《传染病防治法》规定，即使为了防控大局，自如并无权力直接隔离租客，且应当为租客提供生活保障。
In addition, under the Communicable Diseases Act, even in the interests of prevention and control, there is no power to segregate tenants directly, and tenants should be provided with livelihood security.
“合租房风险确实比较大，能理解自如的忧虑，但这个举措太过简单粗暴，助长地域歧视。
"It is true that sharing is risky and understandable, but the move is too simple and crude and encourages regional discrimination."
”张皓然称，如果合租室友在14天内不返回，那么完全可以在原住处进行隔离。
Hao Ran said that if a roommate did not return within 14 days, he could easily be quarantined at his previous home.
张皓然同时指出，如果自如利用租客“不便搬家”（社区禁行限制等原因）、未到复工时间无法返程、返程后被要求自我隔离14天、自湖北等重点地区返程需要强制隔离14天等困顿情形，向租客提出涨价续约的要求，则具备《民法总则》第151条“显失公平”情形之嫌疑，此类合同即使签订了，后续也是可以撤销的。
Hao Ran also pointed out that if the tenant "inconvenience to move" (community restrictions, etc.), before the resumption of work can not return to work, after the return of the 14-day self-isolation from key areas such as Hubei, the renter from the major areas of 14 days, the General Civil Code 151 "obvious unfair" circumstances, such contracts can be rescinded.
作为在北京租房的武汉租客，因为疫情不能返回租处，汤敏能否申请无责退租？2月10日，全国人大常委会法工委表示，当前我国发生新冠肺炎疫情，为了保护公众健康，政府也采取了相应疫情防控措施。
As a tenant in Beijing, because the epidemic situation can not return to rent, can Tang Min apply for rent refunds? Feb. 10, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that in order to protect public health, the government has taken measures to prevent and control the disease.
“对于因此不能履行合同的当事人来说，属于不能预见、不能避免并不能克服的不可抗力。
"For the party thus unable to perform the contract, force majeure is unforeseeable, unavoidable and insurmountable.
”雷家茂表示，因疫情防控需要政府对武汉等地进行“封城”或管制，若导致这些地区的租客长时间无法返回租处或外地的租客无法返回武汉等地的，因患上新冠肺炎需要长时间治疗隔离的，租客可以解除合同即退房，并且不需承担违约责任。
"The disease requires the government to" seal off "or regulate places such as Wuhan because of the epidemic. If tenants in those areas cannot return to places such as Wuhan for a long period of time, tenants can cancel their contracts and check out if they are unable to return to Wuhan for long periods of time.
针对未提供服务能否照常收取服务费的问题，张皓然对中国新闻周刊表示，“在自如未提供合同约定的服务内容时，租客对于其提前支付的1年的服务费，是有要求部分返还的权利的。
"When we are at ease in failing to provide the services stipulated in the contract, the tenant has the right to demand partial refund of his one-year service fee in advance," Zhang told China News Weekly.
”两位律师皆表示，若自如行为属实，租客应为自己维权。
Both lawyers said tenants should be able to defend themselves if it is true.
在雷家茂看来，租客可采取与自如进行协商、向有关部门进行举报、提起诉讼等合理、合法的方式进行维权。
In the view of Leijimao, tenants can take with ease to negotiate, to the relevant departments to report, litigation and other reasonable, legitimate ways to protect their rights.
张皓然则强调租客要有证据意识，应当保留好房东的微信记录、短信记录、通话录音等。
HaoRan stressed that tenants should have evidence awareness, should keep the landlord's micro-letter records, SMS records, voice recordings, and so on.
