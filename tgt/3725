记者/郭慧敏编辑/石爱华 宋建华杨鹏在病房里查房随着疫情防控形势转好，完成救助任务的各地医疗队开始分批离鄂。
Reporter / Guo Huimin Editor / Shi Aihua Song Jianhua Yang Peng in the ward As the situation of prevention and control of the epidemic situation improved, medical teams from all over the country began to leave Hubei in batches.
3月17日，41支国家医疗队3675人踏上返程。
On 17 March, 3,675 members of 41 national medical teams embarked on their return journey.
杨鹏所属的中日友好医院援鄂重症医疗队，是国家卫健委所属的国家医疗队，目前仍坚守在同济医院中法新城院区，撤离时间未定。
Yang Peng's China-Japan Friendship Hospital, a national medical team affiliated with the National Health Council, is still sticking to the French-Xincheng Hospital in Tongji Hospital, the evacuation time has not been determined.
杨鹏所在的重症病房已经连续一周未接收新患者，50张病床空出了37张。
Yang's intensive care unit has not admitted new patients for a week, leaving 37 of the 50 beds vacant.
目前，他所在的定点医院里还住着13位重症及危重症患者，包括武汉市中心医院医生易帆和胡卫锋。
His designated hospital is also home to 13 critically ill and critically ill patients, including doctors Yi Fan and Hu Weifeng of Wuhan Central Hospital.
此前，武汉市中心医院已有四位医生殉职。
Four doctors have been killed in the central hospital in Wuhan.
令人欣慰的是，后来“病人都在好转”。
Thankfully, "the patients are getting better."
来武汉的一个多月，杨鹏见证了医院从“混乱”到有序的过程，除了患者人数不断减少，在治疗药物的选择和治疗策略上，医护人员也有了丰富的经验。
More than a month after coming to Wuhan, Peng Yang witnessed the hospital's transition from chaos to order. In addition to the decreasing number of patients, medical staff have also gained extensive experience in the choice of treatment drugs and treatment strategies.
杨鹏有时甚至想，“如果早有现在的经验，可以更多挽留下那些已经离开的病人”。
Yang Peng sometimes even thought, "If you already have present experience, you can retain more patients who have left."
杨鹏是中日友好医院中西医结合心内科医生，他所在医疗队于2月7日出发前往武汉50张病床，还剩13个病人深一度：目前同济医院中法新城院区情况怎么样？杨鹏：我在重症病房工作，一个病房里有50张床，现在还剩13个病人，重症8个，危重症5个，危重症患者情况都比较严重，需要插管或者上ECMO。
Yang Peng is a Chinese-Japanese Friendship Hospital combined Chinese and Western medicine physician, his medical team left for Wuhan on Feb. 7, leaving 13 patients deep: I work in the intensive care unit, there are 50 beds in one ward, there are still 13 patients, 8 severe cases, 5 critical cases, all of which are serious and require intubation or ECMO.
深一度：武汉中心医院的易帆和胡卫锋医生等患者治疗状况如何？杨鹏：病人整体正在往好的方向发展，尤其是年轻一点的患者，年龄大一点的主要是维持。
At one degree: What is the treatment status of patients such as Yi Fan and Hu Weifeng at Wuhan Central Hospital? Peng Yang: The patient as a whole is developing in a better direction, especially younger patients, and older patients are mainly maintenance.
总的来说我们病区死亡率是比较低的，刚接管病房时，有三位患者去世，后来再没出现死亡病例。
Overall, the mortality rate in our area was relatively low. When we first took over the ward, three patients died and there were no more deaths.
武汉市中心医院的两位医生易帆和胡卫锋分别是在3月4号和5号转过来的，那时候已经在插管了。
Two doctors from Wuhan Central Hospital, Yi Fan and Hu Weifeng, were transferred on March 4 and 5, respectively, when they were already intubating.
入院后，我们给他们做了病情评估后立即做了气管切开，对他们的耐药性做了甄别，有针对性地使用了一些抗生素和抗真菌的药物，后期还使用了康复患者的血浆进行治疗，目前他们恢复得都还不错。
After admission, we gave them an immediate tracheotomy, screened their drug resistance, targeted the use of antibiotics and antifungal drugs, and later used the plasma of convalescent patients, who are recovering well.
易帆整个人已经清醒了，身上插的管子也都拔掉了，问什么话都能对答如流，胡卫锋也已经醒来，身体状况还好。
Yi Fan whole person already sober, the tube that inserts on the body also pulled out, ask what words can answer flow, Hu Wei-feng has also woken up, is in good health.
深一度：目前，你主要的工作内容是什么？杨鹏：目前危重症患者由呼吸重症专业的团队负责，我们现在主要负责重症的病人，我上夜班比较多，主要是看护所有病人，根据病情变化进行一些必要的处理，现在病人少了，我们已经有条件可以轮休。
Peng Yang: At present, we are mainly responsible for serious patients. I work more night shift, mainly care for all patients, according to the changes of the disease, according to the necessary treatment, now there are fewer patients, we have the conditions for rest.
深一度：现在你所在的病房还有新增病例吗？杨鹏：已经持续一周没有收病人了。
Once upon a time: Are there any new cases in your ward? Peng Yang: No patients have been admitted for a week.
深一度：目前防护装备齐全吗？杨鹏：不是很充足，但可以维持病房正常运转，因为防护装备消耗量比较大。
Once upon a time: Is the current protective equipment complete? Yang Peng: Not very sufficient, but can maintain the normal operation of the ward, because the consumption of protective equipment is relatively large.
相比一个月以前，情况已经好很多，至少防护服没那么薄，之前的防护服比较薄，号也不全，有的大一些有的小一些，我们现在很知足。
The situation is much better than a month ago, at least the protective clothing is not so thin, the previous clothing is thin, the number is incomplete, some larger and some smaller, we are satisfied.
左图为医护人员初期使用的防护服，外面套了黄色的隔离服，质地都较薄，右图为后期使用的厚防护服，俗称“大白”武汉本地医疗资源几近崩溃深一度：你所在的医疗队什么时间来的武汉，当时的情况怎样？杨鹏：我们是中日友好医院派出的第5批医护人员，一共67人，也是人数最多的一批，2月7号抵达武汉。
In this picture, the first batch of 67 doctors and nurses from the China-Japan Friendship Hospital arrived in Wuhan on February 7th, and the first batch of 67 doctors and nurses from the China-Japan Friendship Hospital arrived in Wuhan on February 7.
与之前到达的队员汇合后，目前同济医院中法新城院区中日友好医院医疗队一共130人。
After meeting with the former members of the team, the hospital now has a total of 130 medical teams in the French-Japanese Friendship Hospital.
刚到武汉时，疫情已经显示出不可控的趋势了，需要更多人过去帮忙，这个时候肯定要往前冲，所以我也很早就报了名。
When I first arrived in Wuhan, the epidemic was already showing an uncontrollable trend. More people needed help in the past.
SARS爆发的时候，我这一代人正在上学，没有能力去做什么，现在有了多年的从医经验，疫情需要我，当然要义无反顾。
When SARS broke out, my generation was in school, unable to do anything. Now that I have many years of medical experience, the epidemic requires me, of course, to look back.
我们2月6号下午5点接到次日出发的通知，那个晚上，武汉市中心医院的李文亮医生最终没有扛过去，这对我们的打击很大。
We were notified of our departure the next day at 5: 00 p.m. on February 6, when Dr. Li Wenliang of Wuhan Central Hospital finally failed to carry it.
我躺在床上就想，“不是说年轻人不容易感染吗，李文亮也才36岁，怎么突然就走了”，当时一下子意识到这个病的可怕。
I lie in bed and think, "Not that young people are not susceptible to infection, Li Wenliang is only 36 years old, why suddenly left," then suddenly realized the terrible disease.
前几批医疗队反馈说，武汉当时的防护条件比较差，无论是同济医院还是协和医院物资都不齐全，所以我们出发的时候带了一些防护物资。
Previous medical teams reported that Wuhan at the time of the protection conditions are relatively poor, whether Tongji Hospital or Concorde Hospital supplies are not complete, so we set out with some protective materials.
深一度：武汉的真实情况跟你的预期相同吗？杨鹏：我从没来过武汉，对武汉的了解只停留在热干面、长江、黄鹤楼上。
Peng Yang: I have never been to Wuhan, and my knowledge of Wuhan is confined to the hot and dry noodles, the Yangtze River and the Yellow Crane Tower.
下飞机后，武汉天气阴雨绵绵，机场里除了几支医疗队伍就是机场工作人员，整个武汉街道上一个人没有，一辆车也没有。
After getting off the plane, the weather in Wuhan is cloudy and rainy, the airport except for a few medical teams are airport staff, the whole Wuhan street without a single person, a car.
当时坐上车后没有一个人说话，大家的心情都比较沉重。
When I got into the car, no one spoke. Everyone was in a heavy mood.
之前曾经听说随着病毒的传播，毒性可能会越来越弱，但是来了以后发现完全不是。
It has been said before that with the spread of the virus, toxicity may become weaker, but when it does, it is not.
最早一批过来援助的同事还以为问题不是很大，可能一两个星期就能结束援助任务了，没想到情况越来越严重，程度远远超过SARS。
The first group of colleagues who came to the rescue thought the problem was not so great that it could end in a week or two, only to see the situation get worse and worse than SARS.
后来根据统计有超过三千名医护人员感染，武汉的医疗系统不堪重负，所以说我们来得非常有价值，要不然武汉的医疗战线就真的要崩溃了。
The Wuhan medical system was overwhelmed by more than 3,000 cases of infection, so we are of great value, otherwise the medical front in Wuhan would have collapsed.
深一度：前期同济医院的救治状况如何，现在有何改变？杨鹏：刚开始比较忙乱，病人乌央乌央地往里送，有时候直接用公交车往这拉人，重症病房第一天收了26个，第二天收了24个，50个重症及危重症床位两天就满了。
Yang Peng: At the beginning, the patient was rushed to the central and central regions, and sometimes he was taken to the Lara directly by bus. On the first day of the intensive care unit, 26 were received on the first day, 24 were received the next day, and 50 critically ill and critically ill beds were filled up in two days.
那会儿对新冠肺炎没有充分的认识，相关的治疗经验也比较缺乏，对这个疾病的发展规律摸不透，个别病人抢救不过来就去世了。
At that time, there was not enough knowledge of the new crown pneumonia, the relevant treatment experience is relatively scarce, the development of the disease is unpredictable, individual patients can not save the death.
在设备方面，医院开始没有足够的呼吸机。
In terms of equipment, the hospital initially did not have enough ventilators.
2月10号左右，我们从北京中日友好医院运来一批价值1500万的设备，包括无创呼吸机、ECMO、输液泵以及心电监护设备。
Around February 10, we shipped 15 million pieces of equipment from the China-Japan Friendship Hospital in Beijing, including non-invasive ventilators, ECMO, infusion pumps and electrocardiogram (ECG) devices.
起初，医院药品也是不够的，这么多患者爆发式地用同一种药或同一类药，医院即使储备再多也供不上。
At first, hospital medicine was not enough, and so many patients exploded with the same medicine or the same kind of medicine that hospitals could not afford to keep even more in reserve.
后期，我们总结了经验，很多病人都是经验性用药，等待病人做完检查之后，根据指标有选择性的使用与储备药物，情况才有所好转。
Later, we summed up the experience that many patients are empirically treated, waiting for the patient to complete the examination, according to the indicators of selective use and stockpiling of drugs, the situation has improved.
比如，若炎症指标（如铁蛋白）指标过高，应尽早使用糖皮质激素，40mg—160mg/天，根据患者病症严重程度调整剂量。
For example, if indicators of inflammation, such as ferritin, are too high, use glucocorticoids as early as 40 mg-160 mg / day, with doses adjusted for the severity of the disease.
深一度：你当时的心理状态如何？杨鹏：我们大家压力都非常大，除了身体上的疲惫，也很担心防护问题。
Peng Yang: We were all very stressed out, not only tired physically, but also worried about protection.
一线的医护人员虽然人手一套防护服，也担心不能确保万无一失，一不小心交叉感染就麻烦了。
Although the front-line health care workers are equipped with protective clothing, but also worried that can not ensure infallible, accidentally cross-infection will be troublesome.
很多人不是感染科医生，即使是感染科医生也没有经历过这么严重的疫情。
Many people are not infectionists, and even an infectious doctor has not experienced such a serious outbreak.
好在我们有很好的院感防控专家，进入病房前帮助我们一再检查防护服的穿戴。
Fortunately, we have a good sense of control experts, into the ward to help us repeatedly check the wearing of protective clothing.
另一方面的压力来自于不知道疫情将持续多久。
The other side of the pressure comes from not knowing how long the outbreak will last.
当时，每天的确诊人数都是几千几千地增长，也许在这之外，还有一些人憋在家里头，有传染给家人的风险。
At the time, the number of confirmed cases per day was growing in the thousands, perhaps in addition to this, there were people who were holding their heads at home and at risk of infecting their families.
虽然我每天都告诉自己能战胜疫情，只是时间的问题，但这个时间到底多久也说不清楚。
Although it is only a matter of time before I tell myself that I can overcome the epidemic every day, it is not clear how long it will take.
刚到武汉我把头剃了，一是怕头发洗不干净增加感染风险，另外考虑可能很长一段时间没法理发，干脆剃光了，也想通过这种方式表达一下决心。
I just arrived in Wuhan I shaved my head, one is afraid of hair wash not clean increase the risk of infection, also consider a long time may not be able to shave, simply shaved, also want to express a determination.
深一度：你所在的医疗队是否有医护人员感染？杨鹏：没有，都是安全的。
Once upon a time, did your medical team get infected with medical staffPeng: No, they are all safe.
医护人员给危重患者植入IABP（主动脉球囊反搏）以现有的经验，可能救回更多病人深一度：数据显示武汉疫情已基本得到控制，你在武汉的切身体会呢？杨鹏：是的，疫情控制的比较理想，整体情况在好转，明显感觉到病人越来越少，床位都空出来了，之前虽然有新增病例住进来，但也有康复患者陆续出院，现在已经连续一周没有收病人了。
Based on existing experience, doctors and nurses have implanted IABP (aortic balloon counterattack) in critically ill patients and it is possible to save more patients at one degree or another.Yang Peng: Yes, the epidemiological data show that Wuhan is basically under control.
方舱医院也陆续休舱，医疗队已开始撤离。
The cabin hospital has been closed and the medical team has begun to evacuate.
深一度：现在武汉的氛围如何？杨鹏：我2月7号来了以后，直到3月7号才出门转了一转，因为住的酒店就在长江边上，所以去江边溜达了一下，还去了江滩公园。
Yang Peng: After I arrived on February 7, I didn't go out for a walk until March 7, because my hotel is on the edge of the Yangtze River, so I took a stroll along the river and went to Jiangtan Park.
武汉的氛围跟我刚来的时候不一样了，虽然街上还是没什么人，但是车多了一些。
Wuhan atmosphere is not the same as when I first came, although there are still few people in the street, but there are more cars.
深一度：你所在的医疗队需在最后一批撤离吗？杨鹏：国家卫健委所属的国家医疗队撤离时间未定，但心里知道很快就能回家。
Once upon a time: Does your medical team need to be evacuated in the last installment? Peng Yang: The time of departure of the National Medical Team of the National Health Commission has not been determined, but I know it will be able to go home soon.
大家的心情轻松多了，有时间休息，还能出去溜溜弯、锻炼身体。
People are in a much more relaxed mood, have time to rest, and can go out for a walk, exercise.
我们病房里还有病人没出院，包括易帆和胡卫锋，肯定得善始善终，交给别人我们也不放心。
We have patients in the ward not discharged, including Yi Fan and Hu Weifeng, must be a good beginning and end, we do not trust others.
看着别的医疗队离开我们也会“眼馋”，但作为国家派来的医疗队，重症救治是当务之急，疫情不结束我们就不能撤。
It would be "greedy" for us to see other medical teams leave, but as a medical team from the state, critical care is a priority, and we cannot withdraw until the epidemic is over.
深一度：回顾在武汉的经历，你有什么遗憾吗？杨鹏：有。
Once upon a time: Looking back on your experience in Wuhan, do you have any regrets? Peng Yang: Yes.
首先就是我们刚到同济医院时，那三个病人的去世一下子把我们弄懵了，现在想想，如果有现在的经验，也许有可能挽救他们，至少不会让他们走的那么突然。
First of all, when we first arrived at Tongji Hospital, we were stunned by the passing of those three patients. Now, if we had the experience, we might have saved them, at least not so suddenly.
早期，因为对这个疾病认识不够，加上条件（仪器设备）确实有限，病人普遍插管时机较晚，多半是抢救时才插管，所以早期的经验是“插管成活率较低”，危重症抢救气管插管不积极。
In the early years, due to insufficient awareness of the disease, coupled with limited conditions (instrumentation) and the late timing of patients' general intubation, which was mostly performed during resuscitation, early experience was that "survival of intubation was low" and critical resuscitation trachea intubation was not active.
现在就不是那个概念了，病人一觉得不好，我们会马上判断是否需要插管，插管的关口前移避免其演化成危重症。
That's not the concept anymore. When a patient feels bad, we immediately decide if we need a catheter, and the intubation is moved forward to prevent it from developing into a critical condition.
另外，我也了解到武汉本地的医务人员有多么不容易，看到易帆和胡卫锋躺在病床上的时候，我就想，如果躺在那的是我会怎么样，所以真的是竭尽全力在救治。
In addition, I also learned how difficult it is for local medical staff to see Yi Fan and Hu Weifeng lying on the bed, I thought, if I lay there what I would be doing, so I really do my best to cure.
作为同一个战线上的兄弟姐妹，我们现在可以说是同仇敌忾，一定要把疫情扛过去，一定要把这些人从死亡线上拽回来。
As brothers and sisters on the same front, we can now say that we are at one and the same against the enemy. We must carry the disease forward and pull these people back from the line of death.
深一度：想过撤离武汉的场景吗？杨鹏：我想，离开的时候，武汉一定是春季盎然的样子，到处都是健康的人，朋友们可以聚在一起大口吃肉，大口喝酒，重回正常、热闹的生活。
Once upon a time, have you ever thought about leaving Wuhan? Yang Peng: I think when you leave, Wuhan must be in the spring, full of healthy people, friends can get together to stutter meat, drink wine, return to normal, lively life.
在没有经历过的人眼中，这可能像是电视剧，亲身经历后才明白这其中的苦乐。
In the eyes of those who have not experienced it, it can be like a TV play, the bitterness of which is known only after personal experience.
想来，活着本身就是一件幸福且充满希望的事，那些插管的病人，那些挣扎在死亡线上的人，他们原本也应拥有这样的生活。
To be alive is, after all, a happy and hopeful thing in itself, and those who are intubated, those who are struggling to die, should have such a life.
希望疫情过后，医患关系能够有所改善，每一个医生都宣读过希波克拉底誓言，没有谁不希望病人康复。
Hopefully, the doctor-patient relationship will improve after the outbreak, and every doctor has read the Hippocratic Oath, and no one wants the patient to recover.
未来，希望能有更多青年人选择学医。
In the future, it is hoped that more young people will choose medicine.
我们国家的医护人员很缺乏。
There is a shortage of medical staff in our country.
