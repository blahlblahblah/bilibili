2月19日，温州“万名干部进万企”专项行动领导小组办公室《致全市民营企业的一封信》里说：“我们坚信，生来就无惧风雨、不畏险阻的温州民营企业，一定能在这场危中有机的大考中交出’快速恢复、加速转型’的高分答卷。
"We firmly believe that Wenzhou private enterprises, born unafraid of wind and rain and undaunted by danger, will be able to give up the high score of 'quick recovery and accelerated transformation' in this critical mass test," Wen said in a letter to private enterprises in the city.
