本报记者 许礼清 李向磊 北京报道销售过期8年之久和无生产日期的口罩，北京物美商业集团股份有限公司（以下简称“物美”）被推上舆论的风口浪尖。
Reporter Li Xianglei Xu reported in Beijing that the sale of eight-year-old and no-production-date masks, Beijing Wumei Commercial Group Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "the United States") was put on the wave of public opinion.
据不完全统计，售卖问题口罩的物美门店超过17家，其中包括物美的大店、品超等多种门店类型。
According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 17 stores selling problem masks, including many types of stores such as Wumi's, Pinchao and others.
售卖过期8年口罩的门店有14家，售卖无生产日期口罩的门店有5家，有2家门店同时售卖过期和无生产日期口罩。
There are 14 stores selling 8-year-old face masks, 5 stores selling no-production date masks, and 2 stores selling both expired and no-production date masks.
消费者自发组织的维权群，人数已经超过了50人。
The number of activist groups organized spontaneously by consumers has exceeded 50.
根据消费者自发统计的数据，涉事金额已经超过1万元。
According to spontaneous consumer statistics, the amount involved has exceeded 10, 000 yuan.
目前物美官方并无关于全部“问题口罩”销售规模的数据流出。
There is no official flow of data on the scale of sales of all "problem masks."
但根据物美内部人士透露，物美某店共销售口罩16盒，截至2月21日，仅有1名消费者向该店提出了退货要求，其他15盒口罩的购买者并无消息。
But as of February 21, only one consumer had asked for the return of 16 boxes of masks, while the other 15 had not, according to people inside the store.
不仅仅是过期口罩，据消费者反映，物美销售的另外两款口罩还存在“无生产日期”等问题。
Not only expired masks, according to consumers, the sale of the other two masks there are "no production date" and other problems.
“目前口罩是高周转商品，若出现这样的问题，应该不是门店库存积压造成的过期，而是采购源头出了问题。
"At the moment the mask is a high-turnover commodity, and if there is such a problem, it should not be the store inventory backlog caused by expiration, but the source of procurement problems.
在这个时期，物美可能是为了抢货源就放松了要求，采购在找供应商、审核供应商资质、商品质量把关方面不严谨，仓储部门和门店验收也不严谨。
In this period, the United States may be in order to loosen the demand for supplies, procurement in the search for suppliers, review of supplier qualifications, quality control of goods is not rigorous, warehousing departments and store acceptance is not rigorous.
”零售专家黄静告诉《中国经营报》记者，按照正常情况，过期的货品根本就不能收进来，更不能上架销售。
Retail expert Huang Jing told China Business News that expired goods could not normally be collected at all, let alone put on shelves.
因此，根源还是物美内部管理的问题。
Therefore, the root of the internal management of the problem.
就多位消费者反映的上述情况、采购销售方面的具体流程操作、应急物品采销流程是否精简、“过期口罩”事件如何处理等问题，记者多次联系物美相关负责人，截至发稿，物美方面并未对以上问题进行正面回复。
As for the above-mentioned information from many consumers, specific procedures for purchasing and selling, whether the procedures for purchasing and selling emergency items are streamlined, and how to deal with the issue of "expired masks," journalists have repeatedly contacted the relevant officials of the United States of America.
销售过期口罩近日，多位在物美抢购口罩的消费者向《中国经营报》记者爆料称，自己在多点APP上抢购的SAS N95 8617 Mask口罩出现“2009年生产保质期到2012年，保质期被人为遮挡”的情况；Scotts Maksks ASTM口罩、Prestige Ameritech Face Masks医用口罩则出现“无生产日期、包装简陋、口罩不是独立包装、打开盒子直接可以看见口罩”等情况。
A number of consumers snapping up face masks in Wumei recently told China Business News that the SAS N95 8617 Mask Mask, which they had snapped up on the multipoint APP, appeared "with a shelf life of 2009 to 2012, artificially shielded," while Scotts Maksks ASTM mask, Prestige America Face Masks appeared "no production date, poorly packed, mask not individually wrapped, open box can be seen directly."
在多点APP上抢到口罩的王先生（化名）向记者表示，他于2月18日在多点上花费500元购买了一盒SAS N95 8617 Mask口罩，该盒口罩一共20只。
Mr. Wang (not his real name), who snatched the mask from the multi-point APP, told reporters he bought a SAS N95 8617 Mask Mask on Feb. 18 for more than 500 yuan, for a total of 20 masks.
根据和物美的约定时间，王先生在20日早上8点到清河门店自提。
According to the appointment with Wumei, Mr. Wang in the morning of the 20th at 8 a.m. to Qinghe store to pick up.
“抢到口罩后，会收到客服发的短信和自提时间，然后拿着短信去物美超市排队领取，工作人员直接一人发一盒。
"After you grab the mask, you will receive text messages from the customer service and ask for time. Then you will take a text message to the Womi supermarket to collect it.
因为自提的时间不一样，我去的时候比较早，没有几个人排队，但是每个时间段的货都被抢光售罄。
I went there early because I didn't have a lot of people queuing up, but every hour was sold out.
”王先生告诉记者。
"Mr. Wang told reporters.
根据王先生的说法，尽管口罩的价格比较高，但因为害怕买到劣质口罩起不到防护作用，才选择在物美多点上下单抢购。
According to Mr. Wang, although the price of masks is relatively high, but because of the fear of buying low-quality masks do not play a protective role, they choose to buy up and down in the United States.
但让他意外的是，将口罩拿回家才发现已经过期8年。
To his surprise, he took the mask home to find that it was eight years overdue.
根据王先生提供的图片，记者发现，在王先生购买的口罩包装盒底部贴了一张写有“Lot No：09180”的标签，透过标签隐约能看到纸条下方有类似时间的数字标识。
According to the picture provided by Mr. Wang, the reporter found that a label with the words "Lot No: 09180" had been affixed to the bottom of the mask box Mr. Wang had bought.
王先生揭开标签发现，上面写着生产日期为2009年6月，而截止使用日期是2012年6月。
Mr. Wang opened the label and found that the production date was June 2009 and the cut-off date was June 2012.
这样算来，这盒口罩已经过期近8年之久。
That said, the mask is nearly eight years overdue.
撕开标签，能够看到生产日期是2009年6月，而截止使用日期是2012年6月。
When the label was torn open, the production date could be seen as June 2009 and the cut-off date was June 2012.
受访者供图在消费者自发组织的维权群里，记者了解到，和王先生同样购买到“问题口罩”的还有50多人，购买到的产品或过期或无生产日期。
Interviewees in the self-organized advocacy group, the reporter learned that Mr. Wang and the same purchase of "problem masks," more than 50 products, or expired or no production date.
据消费者不完全统计，物美新风店、物美志新店、物美小汤山店、物美清河店、物美中关村店、物美玉林里店、物美玉蜓桥店、顺义仁和美廉美店、物美木樨园店、物美太阳岛店、美廉美百旺店、物美杜家坎店、通州物美西门店、物美潞苑店14家门店售卖已过期的售价500元/盒（20只装）SAS N95 8617 Mask口罩；通州物美西门店、物美清河店、物美光明桥西店、物美宋庄店4家门店售卖无生产日期的售价445元/盒（50只装）Prestige Ameritech Face Maskks医用口罩；通州物美西门店、物美清河店、美廉美管庄店3家门店售卖无生产日期的260元/盒（50只装）的Scotts Maksks ASTM口罩。
According to incomplete consumer statistics, 14 stores in Wumei Xinzhi, Wumei Tangshan, Wumei Qinghe, Wumei Zhongguancun, Tongmei Yulin, Tongmei Yulin, Tongmei Meiqinghe Shop, Tongzhou Wumei Xinghe Shop, Tongmei Yulin Shop, Wu Mei Ching River Shop, Wu Mei Mei Ching River Shop, Wu Mei Mei Ching River Shop, Wu Mei Mei Ching River Shop, Wu Mei Mei Ching Ho Shop, Wu Mei Mei Ching River Shop, Wu Mei Mei Ching Ho Shop, Wu Mei Mei Ching River Shop, Wu Mei Mei Ching River Shop, Wu Mei Mei Ching River Shop, Wu Mei Mei Ching River Shop, Wu Mei Mei Ching River Shop, Wu Mei Mei Ching
另根据《中国消费者报》报道，昌平美廉美超市回龙观二店也有售卖SAS N95 8617 Mask口罩。
The company also sells SAS N95 8617 Mask Mask, according to China Consumer News.
Prestige Ameritech Face Maskks医用口罩和Scotts Maksks ASTM口罩均无生产日期。
Neither the Prestige American Face Maskks medical mask nor Scotts Maksks ASTM mask had any production date.
受访者供图根据物美内部人士透露，物美某店共销售口罩16盒，但截至2月21日，仅有1名消费者向该店提出了退货要求，其他15盒口罩的购买者并无消息。
A total of 16 boxes of masks were sold at a store in Wumei, according to people close to the store, but as of February 21, only one consumer had asked the store for a return, and no information had been received from the buyers of the other 15 boxes.
消费者均在多点APP下单，然后门店自提。
Consumers place orders in the multipoint APP, and then store their own.
受访者供图多数消费者要求物美退货、赔偿、公开道歉。
Most of the consumers asked for return, compensation and public apology.
有购买物美口罩的消费者告诉记者：“自己明确表示不接受只退款的处理方式，但接到客服电话被通知后台直接退款了，对于额外诉求客服表示会向上面反映，但对方未说收回口罩，再联系时，电话显示没有拨打权限，店面座机一直占线。
Consumers who buy face masks told reporters: "They made it clear that they would not accept a refund only, but were told backstage that they would get a direct refund from the customer service.
”截至记者发稿，有不少消费者表示已被“强制退款”。
As of the press release, many consumers said they had been "compulsorily refunded."
但对于赔偿、公开道歉等要求，物美方面并无回应。
But for compensation, public apology and other requirements, the United States did not respond.
对于退换货、口罩召回、问题源头自查等后续处理问题，记者多次以各种方式联系物美相关负责人，均未得到回复。
For the return of goods, mask recall, self-investigation of the source of the problem and other follow-up issues, reporters have repeatedly contacted the relevant United States officials, have not received a response.
哪个环节出了问题？“在特殊时期，口罩等应急产品的采销，企业应该会有应急方案，不可能按照常规采销流程进行。
"At special times, companies should have contingency plans for the marketing of emergency products such as masks, which can't be handled according to normal procedures.
”多年从事采购工作的业内人士告诉记者。
People in the procurement business for years told reporters.
但是否有应急方案，记者并未从物美方面得到相应证实。
But whether there is a contingency plan, reporters have not been from the United States corresponding to the confirmation.
不过，黄静表示：“在不少消费者持续反馈的背后，或许透露着物美内部管理的种种问题。
However, Mr Huang said: "Behind the constant feedback from many consumers, there may be a variety of internal management issues.
”零售管理专家胡春才告诉《中国经营报》记者，常规情况下，零售企业的整个采销流程是一个严格且漫长的过程。
Hu Chuncai, a retail management expert, told China Business News that, as a rule, the entire distribution process for retail companies is a rigorous and lengthy process.
据了解，在正常的零售企业采购流程中，一般是品类部门确定产品，采购部门通过招标等方式确定供应商，敲定价格之后签订合同、开设条码，每一步都要经过严格的层层审批。
It is understood that in the normal procurement process of retail enterprises, it is generally the category department to determine the product, the procurement department through tendering and other means to identify suppliers, after the finalization of the contract, the opening of bar code, each step has to go through strict layers of approval.
采购工作完成后，品类、营运部门要确定哪些门店适合销售新品，再由门店或者采购下单，供应商一般会根据订单向企业的配送中心或者门店发货。
Upon completion of the procurement process, the category and operations department will determine which stores are suitable for the sale of the new products, then by the store or purchase order, the supplier will generally order to the distribution center or stores of the enterprise.
“像口罩这种应急产品，不可能按照常规方式进行采销，因为终端等不及。
"Emergency products like masks can't be sold in a conventional way because terminals can't wait.
也不可能精简掉某个流程，所以就加快流程，但很容易出错。
It is also not possible to streamline a process, so it speeds up the process, but it can easily go wrong.
”胡春才说。
"said Hu Chuncai.
“供应商给企业的配送中心发货，采购部门或许无法看到全部商品，但是配送中心在收货的时候有验货环节，会对每个商品进行检验是否合格、有无破损等情况，但都是通过外包装进行检查。
"The supplier sends the goods to the distribution center of the enterprise and the purchasing department may not be able to see all the goods, but the distribution center has the inspection link at the time of receiving the goods.
检验产品无误后再配送给各个门店，门店在收货的时候也会进行再次检验，日常的销售中也有货架商品的例行检查工作。
Inspection products after the correct distribution to various stores, stores in the time of receipt will also be re-inspection, daily sales also have shelf-goods routine inspection.
”胡春才说，按照行业的普遍标准，超过保质期三分之一的货物，配送中心就不会收货，超过保质期一半时间就不再向门店配送。
According to industry standards, distribution centers don't take delivery of goods more than a third of their shelf life, and aren't delivered to stores half their shelf life, Mr. Hu said.
对于遮挡生产日期的行为，他认为可能是供应商所为。
He thinks the supplier may have been responsible for blocking the production date.
按照胡春才的说法，经过层层的验货工作之后，商品出现过期等问题应该可以避免，但为何还出现销售过期近8年之久的商品？对此，记者多方联系物美方面，截至发稿，物美方面并未就此事进行回复。
According to Hu Chuncai, after layers of inspection work, problems such as the expiration of goods should be avoided, but why the sale of goods nearly eight years overdue?
不过记者以消费者身份从门头沟龙湖店客服人员处了解到，“出事”的产品是由消费者从多点下单，仓储中心直接发货到门店，然后消费者到下单的门店直接自提，门店并未上架商品。
However, the reporter as a consumer from Mentou ditch Longhu shop customer service staff learned that the "accident" products are ordered by consumers from multiple points, the storage center directly to the store, and then consumers to order directly to the store, the store did not shelf goods.
“包装上都是外国文字，咱们也看不懂。
"It's all foreign language on the package, we can't understand it.
”另外，据记者了解，对于其他非“涉事”口罩，也有消费者表示想要退货。
In addition, according to the reporter's understanding, for other non-" involved "masks, there are consumers who expressed a desire to return products.
在当下的消费环境中，尤其是企业陆续复工，像口罩这样的基本防护用品属于刚需物资，但货源又十分紧俏。
In the current consumer environment, especially as enterprises resume work, basic protective equipment such as masks is a new requirement, but the supply is very tight.
胡春才告诉记者，针对疫情期间需求量大的商品，公司采用应急机制，从而简化了采购流程的情况也是可能存在的。
Hu Chunchai told reporters that the company used emergency mechanisms for commodities in high demand during the epidemic, thus simplifying the procurement process is also possible.
以上述门店为例，该门店就简化了上架的过程。
Take the above store as an example, the store simplified the process of getting on the shelves.
记者还了解到，口罩的采购属于清洁课组，其常规的采购销售的流程如何，此次是否简化流通环节尚无从知晓。
The reporter also learned that the purchase of masks belongs to the cleaning group, its regular procurement and sales procedures, whether the simplification of circulation is not known.
对于消费者反映的上述口罩问题，记者致电国家市场监管总局，相关负责人表示，根据《市场监管总局等八部门关于开展打击整治非法制售口罩等防护产品专项行动的紧急通知》，市场监管部门和药监部门会同有关部门会重点打击生产销售无生产日期、厂名厂址、产品质量合格证明等三无产品以及冒用认证标志等质量标志的行为，商标侵权、假冒专利、仿冒混淆、虚假宣传和虚假广告的行为。
In response to questions from consumers about the above-mentioned masks, the relevant officials called the State Administration of Market Supervision, who said the market regulator and the drug watchdog, together with other relevant departments, will focus on cracking down on the production and sale of products without production date, factory name, product quality certification and other quality marks.
