“刚来时想到了困难，但没想到这么困难”3月20日上午，一支转运了2525名患者的特殊队伍正式撤离武汉。
"At first thought of difficulties, but did not expect so difficult," March 20 morning, a transhipment of 2525 patients of a special team officially withdrew from Wuhan.
队员们在武汉疾控中心门前合影、唱歌、拥抱，仿佛那些曾切实经历过的苦难，将就此尘封。
Team members in Wuhan in front of the CDC photo, singing, hugging, as if those who have actually experienced the suffering, will be sealed.
转运队队员即将撤离武汉组织援鄂医疗救援转运队的指令是在2月4日晚8点传到河南省急救中心的。
The transfer team members were about to leave Wuhan to organize medical rescue and transshipment team in Hubei province on February 4 at 8 pm to the Henan Emergency Medical Center.
那是一则不断加码的指令，需备物资的天数，6小时内翻了3倍。
It was an ever-increasing order, and the number of days it took to get supplies tripled in six hours.
各急救站来不及筹备，只能连夜征用其它出诊车上的物资，A车队22个N95口罩、B车队6套防护服……200多套有零有整地堆起来，总算达到指令要求的“最多备10天”。
The first-aid stations did not have time to prepare, had to requisition other vehicles overnight supplies, convoy A 22 N95 masks, convoy B six sets of protective clothing... more than 200 pieces of land stacked up, finally met the directive's "maximum 10 days."
谁知一待就是45日。
And who knew it was the 45th day.
路况不熟、物资不够，作为全国唯一一支援鄂医疗救援转运队，他们没有任何经验可以借鉴。
The road is not ripe, the material is not enough, as the only support Hubei medical rescue transshipment team, they do not have any experience to learn.
81名急救员和21台车（救护车是19台、指挥车1台、物资车1台）穿梭在武汉街头巷尾，路上熟悉的元素只有响个不停的警笛声。
Eighty-one first aid workers and 21 vehicles (19 ambulances, 1 command vehicle, 1 cargo truck) shuttled through Wuhan streets and lanes, the only elements familiar on the road were the constant sirens.
收了没？收了没？转运队的前期准备工作是十分顺畅的：2月5日下午到达武汉，晚上和武汉急救队交接组队（武汉10辆转运急救车，河南18辆转运急救车）；2月6日凌晨4点在酒店内完成院感培训，上午领任务，下午2点投入工作。
Did you get it? Preliminary preparations for the transfer party were smooth: I arrived in Wuhan on the afternoon of Feb. 5 and handed over to Wuhan first aid team in the evening (Wuhan 10 transporter and 18 transshipment ambulance in Henan).
可救援现场的问题远不止“人生地不熟”那么简单。
Can rescue the scene of the problem is far more than "life is unfamiliar" so simple.
信息不通畅，医院没有床，现场经常出现救护车里“压”患者的情况。
Information is not smooth, hospitals do not have beds, the scene often ambulance "pressure" patients.
车队转运的第一个患者曾在协和医院门口停了近6个小时，形势严峻时，一家医院门口能同时滞留六七辆载着患者的救护车。
The first patient in the convoy had been parked in front of the Concorde hospital for nearly six hours, and six or seven ambulances carrying the patients could be stranded in front of a hospital during the severe situation.
指挥部的人一样干等着。
Command's just waiting.
河南援鄂医疗救援转运队副总指挥燕重远今年46岁了。
Yan Zhong, deputy director of the Hubei Medical Rescue Transfer Team in Henan province, is 46 years old.
过去几十年里，他曾是一名120急救员，还参加过汶川救灾等多项重大救援工作。
He has been a 120-year-old first-aid worker for decades and has worked on major relief efforts such as the Wenchuan disaster relief effort.
这一次，他负责转运车队的具体调度。
On this occasion, he was responsible for the specific movement of the convoy.
河南援鄂医疗救援转运队副总指挥燕重远他告诉中国新闻周刊，自己曾看到很多报道救护车不及时转运患者的新闻，他无法反驳，也变不出空床位，只能一遍遍打电话问队员：收了没？收了没？患者之外，让他担忧不已的，还有工作内容大大超过日常范围的一线急救员。
He told China News Weekly that he had seen a lot of news about ambulances not relocating patients in time. He could not refute or change the beds available. He could only call his team over and over again and asked the team, "Do you have it?
漫长的等待中，患者上厕所、氧气吸光等状况都由急救员处理。
In the long waiting period, patients go to the toilet, oxygen absorption and other conditions are handled by emergency personnel.
金银潭医院、红十字会医院等重点院区的医护人员没空接患者，要由急救员将其送到具体楼层。
Health care workers in key hospital areas such as Gold and Silver Pool Hospital and Red Cross Hospital are not available to take patients to specific floors.
问题是，为了省防护服，很多急救车根本没达到每车4人的标准配置。
The problem is that many ambulances are simply not up to the standard four-person-per-car configuration to save on protective clothing.
于是，医院里会出现一个急救员歪歪扭扭地推着患者，边导航边问路寻找病区的场景。
As a result, there will be a hospital emergency staff will push the patient crooked, navigation and ask for the scene of the disease area.
为搬运患者长期走动的过程中，有的急救员N95口罩被汗浸湿了，有的防护服被刮破、鞋套全部撕开。
Some of the N95 masks were soaked in sweat, others were torn and shoe covers ripped open while moving patients for extended periods of time.
现实条件不允许第一时间更换，更满足不了一车一换，急救员心知肚明，便冒着感染病毒的风险继续工作。
Reality conditions do not allow for a first-time replacement, more can not meet a car change, the first-aid staff know, then risk infection to continue to work.
“刚来时想到了困难，但没想到这么困难。
"I thought of the difficulty when I first came, but I didn't expect it.
不瞒你说，我们第一天出诊，至少有3个队员尿裤子。
As a matter of fact, the first day we went out, at least three team members peed their pants.
”3月20日的撤离现场，他望着不远处正笑着合照的队员哭着说：“都是成年人，确实不容易。
"It wasn't easy," he said, as he watched the smiling group photo nearby at the scene of the March 20 evacuation.
”从轻症到重症30岁的急救员王京春清晰地记得2月4日晚10点收到的医院通知——有事。
From mild to severe, 30-year-old Wang Jingchun vividly remembers receiving a hospital call at 10 p.m. Feb. 4 -- yes.
当时，他还以为是之前“请战”在河南一线防疫的事有了着落，直到凌晨2点具体通知下达，他才知道，自己要去武汉了。
At that time, he thought it was the "request for war" in Henan before the first line of epidemic prevention has come to an end, until 2 a.m. the specific notice issued, he knew that he was going to Wuhan.
转运队初期的工作以转运轻症病人为主，“应收尽收”政策要求下，患者数量多到一车坐4、5个。
The initial work of the Transhipment Unit was dominated by transshipment of light patients. Under the policy of "collect as much as possible," the number of patients reached 4 or 5 per vehicle.
王京春性子急，遇见医院床满不收患者的情况会特别焦躁，“因为一点小事，莫名其妙地跟谁都能发起火来”。
Wang Jingchun quick-tempered, encountered the hospital bed full of patients will be particularly anxious, "because of a small matter, inexplicably with anyone can start a fire."
同一时间的燕重远正忙着和总指挥调整策略。
At the same time Yan Yuan is busy with the overall command adjustment strategy.
小到给急救员手机缠保鲜膜、买纸尿裤，大到早操查车、分救护梯队，每一项都要立刻推进。
Small to the first-aid staff wrapped plastic wrap, buy diapers, large enough to do morning exercises, ambulance echelons, every one of immediately to advance.
直至2月下旬武汉物资情况缓和，整个转运队的紧绷状态才有所缓解。
Until the end of February Wuhan material situation eased, the entire transit team tension was relieved.
撤离前一晚，转运队队员在酒店门前集合，准备乘大巴去看武汉夜景。
On the night before the evacuation, members of the transshipment team gathered in front of the hotel to take a bus to see Wuhan Night View.
3月12日，武汉市新冠肺炎疫情防控指挥部医疗救治组医疗组组长白祥军在新闻发布会上表示，将把全市50多家收治新冠肺炎患者的定点医院，向医疗资源丰富的10家医院集中。
On March 12, Bai Xiangjun, head of the medical treatment group of Wuhan's Xinguan Pneumonia Prevention and Control Command, said at a news conference that he would concentrate more than 50 hospitals in the city that treat patients with pneumonia, concentrating them in 10 hospitals with abundant medical resources.
转运队的工作重点由此从“转轻症”变成“转重症”。
The focus of the transshipment team was thus changed from "light cases" to "severe cases."
转诊量少了，患者的病情危重程度却高了。
The number of referrals is low, but the severity of the patient's illness is high.
“最多的时候，上呼吸机的ICU病人，我们一天攒了6个。
"Most of the time, we saved up to six ICU patients a day on the ventilator.
这6个病人和我们前期一天转的40个、50个又不是一个概念了。
These 6 patients are not the same as the 40 and 50 we took over the previous day.
”燕重远说。
"said Yan.
更重要的是，转运队面临的独有限制依然存在。
More importantly, the unique constraints faced by the trans-shipment teams remain.
国家卫健委要求落实三级查房制度，即住院医师、主治医师、主任（副主任）医师或科主任查房。
The National Health Commission requires the implementation of a three-level housing inspection system, that is, residents, attending physicians, directors (deputy director) physicians or division directors.
可队伍人力无法满足在每辆车上配满三级医师，救护车也装不下这么多人。
But the team couldn't afford to have three doctors in every car, and an ambulance couldn't hold so many people.
无奈之下，指挥部只能采取负责医生把病例发到工作微信群、高职称医师们线上评估重症患者转运风险的方式。
In desperation, the command can only take the responsible doctors to the work of micro-groups, high-title physicians online to assess the risk of severe patients in transit.
呼吸不稳不能转、血氧饱和度达不到90%不能转、血压不稳不能转……消息一来一回，免不了消耗时间。
Breathing instability can not turn, blood oxygen saturation to less than 90% can not turn, blood pressure instability can not turn... news once, inevitable consumption of time.
等待调派指令期间，王京春被重症患者的痛苦状态深深震撼着。
Waiting for the transfer order, Wang Jingchun was seriously shocked by the suffering of the seriously ill.
“一对老夫妇，80多岁，自己买个行军床，弄个氧气瓶，坐在那吸氧。
"An old couple, in their 80s, bought their own camp bed, got an oxygen cylinder, and sat there taking in oxygen.
医生测一下血氧饱和度，好，走了。
The doctor measured the oxygen saturation of the blood. Okay, let's go.
血氧饱和度比较低，他们特别难熬，医院全都是人，没有医生护士能有空搭理他们一下。
Blood oxygen saturation is low, they are particularly hard to endure, hospitals are full of people, and no doctor or nurse has time to talk to them.
”他告诉中国新闻周刊，后来老夫妇符合转运条件，被送到了更好的医院救护。
He told China News that the old couple later met the transit criteria and were sent to a better hospital.
但即便是在采访现场，他一闭眼，最先浮现出来的患者面孔还是他们。
But even at the scene of the interview, they were the first patients to emerge as soon as he closed his eyes.
离开武汉之前转运队入住的酒店位于武汉疾控中心旁，距华南海鲜市场只有539米的步行路程。
Before leaving Wuhan, the transfer team stayed in Wuhan next to the CDC, only 539 meters from the South China Seafood Market.
3月19日晚，所有队员在这里列队，打算在撤离前看一看武汉的夜景。
On the night of March 19, all the members of the team lined up here to see the night view of Wuhan before leaving.
“队员平常戴着眼镜、面罩，看不到武汉的美，我就说能不能找两个大巴，让他们逛一下。
"Usually wearing glasses, masks, Wuhan, I said that I can find two buses, let them stroll around.
”援鄂医疗救援转运队队长、总指挥乔伍营告诉中国新闻周刊。
Qiaowu camp, head of the medical rescue and transshipment team in Hubei, told China News Weekly.
在他身后停着一辆编号NO.00001的郑州急救车，后者曾参加汶川救灾、印尼海啸救灾等多项救援工作。
Behind him was a Zhengzhou emergency ambulance with number NO.00001, which had taken part in many rescue operations, including the Wenchuan disaster relief and the tsunami relief operation in Indonesia.
燕重远称，这支平均年龄约30岁的转运队几乎和这台车一样“历史悠久”，近三分之一的队员有从伍经历。
Yansheng says the transshipment team, with an average age of about 30, has almost the same "long history" as the car, with nearly a third of its members having served.
这些都保证了队伍可以迅速适应工作、调整心态。
These ensure that the team can quickly adapt to work, adjust the mentality.
参加过多次重大救援工作的急救车“心理医生说我们是‘嗷嗷乱叫’的队，像西亚山的老虎。
"Psychologists say we're in the 'cry out' line, like the tigers of Mount West Asia, 'says a first-aid truck that has participated in major rescue efforts.
有时大家都收工睡觉了，我在工作群里发转运需求，马上有人‘抢单’。
Sometimes we all close down to sleep, I work in the group of trans-shipment demand, someone immediately 'rob the bill'.
抢不到的人说上次他们去过了，抢到的说谁让你上次没拿手机了？很快乐。
Unable to grab the last time they have been to say who let you not take the phone last time? Very happy.
”他说。
'he said.
但他不否认，快乐的背后是高强度工作带来的重压。
But he doesn't deny that the stress of hard work lies behind happiness.
因救护车工作时间不定，2月29日之前，转运队队员始终吃不到热饭，没有微波炉，只能把米饭扒出来，开水一冲了事。
Owing to the irregular working hours of ambulances, prior to 29 February, the members of the transit team had not been able to eat hot meals and did not have a microwave, but had to dig out the rice and rinse with boiling water.
很多队员表示，现在已经到了“一提盒饭就想吐”的地步。
Many players said it was time to "just mention the boxed rice and throw up."
燕重远认为，更辛苦的是从2019年12月就投入工作的武汉急救队。
Yan Shuangyuan believes that the harder from December 2019 to put into operation Wuhan first-aid team.
目前，武汉10家定点医院中都有病人，他们的工作远没有到结束的时候。
At present, Wuhan 10 designated hospitals have patients, their work is far from the end.
3月20日上午，转运队正式撤离。
On the morning of 20 March, the convoy officially withdrew.
组织整队之前，队员们笑着在酒店和武汉疾控中心门前合影。
Before organizing the whole team, the team members smiled and took pictures in front of the hotel and Wuhan CDC.
也有的队员会哭，媒体的摄像机和手机会在第一时间把流泪的人围起来。
Some team members will cry, the media camera and the mobile phone will be the first time around the person in tears.
据了解，转运队回到河南后，会进行为期14天的集中隔离。
It is understood that the transshipment team will return to Henan after a period of 14 days of concentrated isolation.
“武汉人民非常感谢我们，我觉得很自豪。
"Wuhan people are very grateful to us, I feel very proud.
”王京春操着浓重的河南口音说，“这是真的，不是大空话。
"This is true, not empty talk," said Wang, speaking with a thick Henan accent.
”他说，以前没感觉，要走的时候，会发现这里的人是那么团结。
'I didn't feel it before, 'he says.' When I want to go, I find people here are so united.
还有，昨晚的鸡腿“特别香”。
And last night, the drumstick was very fragrant.
