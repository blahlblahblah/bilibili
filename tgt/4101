不能掉以轻心杰瑞米·布朗是一位资深的军医和急诊科医生，在伦敦大学医学院取得博士学位，随后前往波士顿贝斯以色列医院进行急救医学实习，目前是美国国立卫生研究院急救护理研究办公室负责人。
Jeremy Brown is a veteran military and emergency doctor who received a doctorate from the University of London School of Medicine and then went on an emergency medical practice at Bess Israel Hospital in Boston, where he is currently head of the National Institutes of Health's Office of Emergency Care Research.
他曾任华盛顿大学急救医学系研究主任，在此期间，他带领团队建立了一套HIV的筛查程序，一种针对肾绞痛的新疗法获得了美国国立卫生研究院的三项许可。
He was a research director at the University of Washington's Department of Emergency Medicine, during which time he led a team to develop a screening program for HIV, a new treatment for renal colic that received three approvals from the National Institutes of Health.
他所著的《致命流感》一书分析和透视了病毒与人类社会的关系，备受赞誉。
His book, Lethal Influenza, is praised for its analysis and perspective of the relationship between the virus and human society.
《中国新闻周刊》：人们对于1918年那场大流感的认识，经历了什么样的曲折变化？杰瑞米·布朗：大流感发生的时候，人们并没有迅速认识到这场灾难的教训。
CHINA NEWSWEEK: What were the twists and turns in people's perception of the 1918 pandemic? Jeremy Brown: When the pandemic happened, the lessons of the disaster were not quickly recognized.
二十世纪初期，召开了一些国际会议，试图攻克各种传染病，包括霍乱、黄热和肺炎，甚至建立预防体系。
In the early twentieth century, a number of international conferences were held to try to combat infectious diseases, including cholera, yellow fever and pneumonia, and even to establish prevention systems.
这最终导致了世界卫生组织的成立。
This culminated in the establishment of the World Health Organization.
但是，如果我们不知道一种传染病的成因，就很难攻克它。
But if we do not know the cause of an infectious disease, it is very difficult to defeat it.
直到1933年，我们才确认了导致大流感的病毒。
It was not until 1933 that we identified the virus that caused the pandemic.
《中国新闻周刊》：对于流感和新冠肺炎这样的流行病，最难解决的是什么？杰瑞米·布朗：作为一名曾经的急诊科医生，我有多年的治疗流感的经验，对1918年大流感也进行过研究。
CHINA NEWSWEEK: What's the hardest thing to do about pandemics like influenza and pneumonia? Jeremy Brown: As a former emergency doctor, I've had years of experience treating flu, and I've studied the 1918 pandemic.
和如今新冠肺炎的情况一样，那场大流感有着双重层面。
As is now the case with pneumonia, the pandemic has a twofold dimension.
对于大多数人来说，症状并不严重，会造成一些生活的不便，需要在家躺上数日，除此之外不会有别的了。
For most people, the symptoms are not serious, cause some inconvenience, need to stay at home for a few days, and nothing else.
但对一部分人来说，流感可能会演变成威胁生命的重病。
But for some, the flu could turn into a life-threatening illness.
我们已经了解到，新冠肺炎也是这样，和流感一样都是冬季高发的疾病。
We have learned that the same is true of pneumonia in the new crown, which is as common in winter as the flu.
它经常会导致季节性的感冒和咳嗽，但有时候会突然演变成重症。
It often leads to seasonal colds and coughs, but sometimes suddenly becomes severe.
对于它，我们不能掉以轻心。
We cannot take it lightly.
《中国新闻周刊》：目前疫情已经在全世界蔓延，特别是不同的国家有着不同的政治制度和医疗体系，面对的是共同的敌人——病毒。
CHINA NEWSWEEK: The epidemic is spreading all over the world, with different countries having different political and health systems and facing a common enemy - the virus.
从国际合作的角度来说，我们能从历史中学到些什么经验和教训？杰瑞米·布朗：1918年大流感暴发的时候，还没有多少国际合作的渠道。
What lessons can we learn from history from the perspective of international cooperationJeremy Brown: When the Great Influenza outbreak of 1918, there were not many avenues for international cooperation.
相反，每个国家各自为战，采取不同的措施。
Instead, each country acts in a fragmented manner, taking different measures.
有的国家封锁了边境，至少试图这样做过。
Some countries have blocked their borders, at least trying to do so.
比如，澳大利亚当时就强制实行了一项非常严格的隔离计划，但是这并没有能够阻止流感在1919年初的入境。
Australia, for example, imposed a strict quarantine plan at the time, but that did not stop the flu from arriving in early 1919.
现如今，各国仍会制定各自的公共卫生政策，但与此同时，医疗信息共享的程度非常高。
Today, countries are still developing their own public health policies, but at the same time, there is a very high level of sharing of medical information.
比如说，新冠肺炎暴发之后的短短数周，一个中国科研团队就确定了病毒，描述了基因序列，并将其发表在主流医学期刊上。
For example, just weeks after the outbreak of pneumonia in the New Crown, a Chinese research team identified the virus, described its sequence and published it in the mainstream medical journal.
传染病不分国界，科学家们深知这一点，他们频繁的合作给我留下了深刻的印象。
Scientists know that infectious diseases know no boundaries, and I am impressed by their frequent collaboration.
《中国新闻周刊》：目前很多人寄希望于疫苗和特效药的研发，你怎么看？杰瑞米·布朗：我们已经有了几种抗病毒的药物，尽管无法做到药到病除，但是对于那些感染新冠肺炎或者流感的病人来说，可能还是有用的。
What do you thinkJeremy Brown: We already have several kinds of antiviral drugs, and although we can't get rid of them, they may be useful for those with new crown pneumonia or flu.
至于研制新的药物和疫苗，临床试验可能需要数年的时间，具体时间无法准确预测。
As for the development of new drugs and vaccines, clinical trials may take years and cannot be predicted with precision.
这很大程度上取决于疫苗试验的时候疫情的严重情况。
Much will depend on the severity of the outbreak at the time of the vaccine trials.
如果到那时候，还有很多病人，并且疫苗效果很明显，那么我们会比较容易通过对比看到差异。
If by then there are still a lot of patients and the effect of the vaccine is obvious, then it will be easier to look at the differences by contrast.
但是如果那时候病人的数量不知为何突然大幅下降了，没有足够的病人来分组对照，那么，就算疫苗真的起作用，也无法很轻松地检测出它的效果。
But if the number of patients suddenly drops dramatically by that time, and there are not enough patients to control them in groups, even if the vaccine does work, its effects cannot be easily detected.
2016年埃博拉疫情的时候，类似的事情就发生过。
When Ebola broke out in 2016, something similar happened.
由于当时公共卫生方面的不懈努力，埃博拉病人的数量急剧减少，无法进行疫苗试验。
As a result of ongoing public health efforts at the time, the number of Ebola patients was drastically reduced and no vaccine trials were possible.
这样的情况也可能发生在目前的新冠肺炎疫苗上。
The same could happen with the current vaccine for crowns pneumonia.
我们必须知道，疫苗对于不同的传染病，效果往往差异极大。
We must be aware that vaccines often have very different effects for different infectious diseases.
比如说，天花的疫苗效果很好，我们已经完全将它从地球上清除。
Smallpox, for example, has worked so well that we have completely removed it from the face of the earth.
然而，我们每年的流感疫苗，顶多也只有50～60%的效果。
However, our annual flu vaccine is only 50-60% effective at best.
不同的流感需要不同的疫苗，每年都要打一次。
Different types of flu require different vaccines, which are administered once a year.
新冠肺炎的疫苗究竟会是跟天花疫苗那样效果明显，还是会像流感疫苗那样起伏不定，谁也不知道。
No one knows whether the vaccine for pneumonia will be as effective as the smallpox vaccine, or whether it will fluctuate like a flu vaccine.
《中国新闻周刊》：你作为一名急诊科医生经历过2009年的那场H1N1禽流感大流行，对于类似的流行病，有什么特别的感受吗？杰瑞米·布朗：当2009年那场疫情终于结束的时候，它的死亡率实际上是比以往要低的。
CHINA NEWSWEEK: As an emergency doctor you went through the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, do you have any special feelings about a similar epidemic? Jeremy Brown: When the epidemic finally ended in 2009, its death rate was actually lower than it used to be.
但是大家对这次疫情的认知是，它是一个异常可怕的疾病。
But what we all know about the epidemic is that it is a terrible disease.
我感觉，作为职业的医护从业者，我们使用的语言非常重要。
I feel that as a professional healthcare practitioner, the language we use is very important.
我们要确保大众理解流感和新冠肺炎暴发的真正危险。
We need to ensure that the public understands the real risks of outbreaks of influenza and pneumonia.
两者虽然都可以非常致命，但幸运的是，对于绝大多数健康的人来说，它并不会造成严重的生命危险。
Both can be deadly, but luckily for the vast majority of healthy people, they are not life-threatening.
《中国新闻周刊》：你在HIV检测方面有着成功的经验，很多人都很关心疾病检测的问题，你觉得重要的是什么？杰瑞米·布朗：没有任何检测手段是百分之百准确的，这样的结果就是，我们检测出了假阳性的病例。
CHINA NEWSWEEK: You have a successful experience in HIV testing and a lot of people are concerned about the issue of disease testing. What do you think is important? Jeremy Brown: No test is 100 percent accurate.
也就是说，检测结果是阳性的，但实际上检测对象并没有感染病毒。
That is, the test results were positive, but the test subjects were not infected with the virus.
当数以百万计的人们被检测是否感染病毒的时候，我们可能会遇到数以千计的假阳性病例。
When millions of people are tested for the virus, we may encounter thousands of false positive cases.
那么下一个关键问题就是，当我们等待确定最终结果的这个时间里，应该对所有的这些病人怎么办。
The next key question, then, is what to do with all these patients while we wait to determine the final outcome.
