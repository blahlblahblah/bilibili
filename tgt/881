本报记者 陈茂利 北京报道公路电影《摩托日记》中有句广为人知的台词：“在别人的苦难面前，我怎么能转过身去。
"How can I turn around in the face of other people's suffering" is a well-known line in the road movie "The Diary of the Motorcycle" reported by our reporter Chen Maoli in Beijing.
”这句台词，在今天新型冠状病毒肆虐的中国大地上，一次又一次地上演。
"This line, in today's new coronavirus ravaging China's land, again and again staged.
“王师傅，跑一趟吧，送10万只口罩到武汉。
Master Wang, run and send 100,000 masks to Wuhan.
”农历庚子年大年初一（1月25日）中午，正在与家人过年的安徽宁国中通快递货车司机王慎才接到公司经理的电话。
Wang Shen, a Zhongtong express delivery truck driver in Ningguo, Anhui Province, who was spending the New Year with his family on January 25, received a telephone call from the company's manager.
接到任务，王慎才没想太多，迅速收拾衣服和路上吃的零食，接上了副驾驶熊楚英，开着公司那辆9米6的蓝色福田欧航直奔接货仓库。
On receiving the assignment, Wang Shen quickly packed his clothes and snacks for the trip. He was joined by his co-pilot Xiong Chu-ying, who drove the company's 9-meter-6 blue Fukuda straight to the delivery warehouse.
“满满一仓库口罩，整整一百箱，用了不到半小时，我们和两个装卸工就搬空了。
It took us less than half an hour to fill a warehouse full of masks, a whole hundred cases, and in less than half an hour we and the two loaders were emptied
”直到点货签单时，王慎才这才想起来，出门时走的急，忘了自备口罩。
Not until the order was signed did Wang Shen realize that he had forgotten to bring his own mask when he left the house in a hurry.
（中通驾驶员王慎才、熊楚英驾驶着货车载着10万只口罩从安徽宁国出发）“要送到武汉去？”得知他们要去武汉疫情区，仓库工作人员塞给他们一人10只口罩。
(Shen-cai Wang and Xiong Chu-ying drive from Ningguo, Anhui Province in a lorry carrying 100,000 masks) "To Wuhan?" Knowing that they were going to Wuhan, the warehouse staff put 10 masks on each of them.
此前，49岁的王慎才从未去过武汉，印象中的武汉是黄鹤楼、热干面和长江大桥。
Previously, 49-year-old Wang Shen-chai has never been to Wuhan, the impression of the Yellow Crane Tower, hot and dry face and the Yangtze River Bridge.
那时的他还不是很清楚，这一趟全长600多公里、历经12小时，要横穿安徽、江西、武汉三省的任务是多么的重要。
At that time, he was not very clear, this journey of more than 600 km, after 12 hours, to cross Anhui, Jiangxi, Wuhan Province is how important the task.
就在他接到任务的前2天，1月23日，武汉宣布“封城”：城市公共交通暂停运营，离汉通道暂时关闭。
Two days before he received his assignment, on January 23, Wuhan announced the "closure" of the city: the city's public transport operation was suspended, leaving Han corridor temporarily closed.
出发前，王慎才了解到，他们这次的任务是将阿里巴巴公益基金会捐赠的10万只N100口罩送到武汉东西湖区卫生健康局支援一线医务人员。
Prior to their departure, Wang Shen learned that their mission this time is to Alibaba charitable foundation donated 100,000 N100 masks sent to Wuhan East and West Lake Health Bureau to support front-line medical personnel.
而目的地十几公里外，就是此次新冠肺炎传播的核心重灾区汉口火车站。
The destination of more than 10 kilometers away, is the new crown pneumonia spread of the core of the Hankou railway station.
“知道他要去武汉疫区，那一夜心里七上八下的。
"Knowing that he was going to Wuhan affected area, that night in the heart.
在他出发前，我还不敢表现出来。
I didn't dare to show it until he left.
”事后，王慎才的妻子对《中国经营报》记者说。
"Wang Shen-cai's wife later told China Business News.
“虽然担心，但知道他得去。
"Worried as he was, I knew he had to go.
”“别人都在往外跑，你们怎么还往里去？”“我们在宁国上的高速。
"Why are you still running in when the rest of the world is running out?"
”引擎发动的那一刻，王慎才开始紧张起来。
The moment the engine started, Wang Shen began to get nervous.
他告诉记者，跑了十几年长途运输，这种感觉只有非典那年有过。
He told reporters that he had run more than a decade of long-distance transport, this feeling only SARS that year.
犹豫再三，他决定告诉老婆这趟不寻常的任务，老婆只回了一句话，“把自己保护好”。
Hesitantly, he decided to tell his wife this unusual assignment, his wife only returned a sentence, "to protect themselves."
回忆起当时的情景，王慎才说，“在城里的时候没怎么样，当货车上高速，路上稀稀拉拉见不到几辆车，和往常大不一样，只有发动机和风燥声，心里有点忐忑。
Wang Shen recalled the scene, "when in the city is not very good, when the van on the highway, the road rarely saw a few cars, and as usual, only engine and wind dry sound, a little perturbed.
”10km、100km……随着那辆9.6米的蓝色福田欧航在高速上平稳地行驶起来，王慎才心里慢慢的平静下来。
With the 9.6-metre blue Fukuda on the high road running smoothly, Wang Shen slowly calmed down.
（王慎才说：“我是一名退伍军人，应该担起来这份责任。
"I am a veteran and should take the responsibility," said Wang Shengcai.
”）这蓝色福田欧航刚买了不到一年，平时就是在安徽宁国和芜湖之间跑。
") The blue Fukuda European Airlines has just bought less than a year, usually between Ningguo and Wuhu in Anhui Province.
而这次装载的100箱10万只N100口罩是由菜鸟网络组建的“武汉救援物资绿色通道”第一单发往武汉的物资。
The 100-carton N100 mask was the first shipment of Wuhan Green Channel, a network of rookies, to Wuhan.
据悉，1月25日，菜鸟联合海内外物流企业发布紧急公告，正式开通国内及全球绿色通道，免费从海内外各地为武汉地区运输社会捐赠的救援物资。
It is reported that on January 25, the inexperienced logistics enterprises at home and abroad issued an emergency announcement, officially opening domestic and global green channels, free of charge from home and abroad to transport relief materials donated by the community to Wuhan.
这条绿色通道在公布后的短短16个小时，就接到全球数百家企业、机构、团体的电话接洽捐赠需求，涉及的救援物资包括口罩、检测试剂盒、护目镜、防护服、乳胶手套、消毒液双氧水、照明设备等。
Within 16 hours of its launch, the Green Channel received calls from hundreds of companies, institutions and organizations around the world for donations of respirators, test kits, goggles, protective clothing, latex gloves, disinfectant hydrogen peroxide, lighting and so on.
途中，王慎才和熊楚英在宣城的一个服务区加了点油，吃了泡面。
On the way, Wang Shen and Xiong Chu-ying added some oil and noodles to a service area in Xuancheng.
“加油站的员工、店里卖东西的人，全都戴口罩。
"The gas station staff, the people who sell stuff in the store, all wear masks.
”没有了平日里的闲聊，加油站显得格外的安静。
"Without the usual chatter, the gas station seemed particularly quiet.
然而就在加完油，王慎才要开车离开时，工作人员喊了一句：“加油！”“加油！”让他想起来，出发前，有亲戚曾劝他不要接这次任务，“别人都在往外跑，你们怎么还往里去？”王慎才在后来的采访中告诉记者，“当时我也没多想，我是一名退伍军人，自己应该担起来这份责任。
However, just after adding oil, Wang Shen was about to drive away when the staff shouted: "Come on!" Let him remember, before leaving, some relatives advised him not to take up the mission, "others are running away, why are you still going in?" Wang Shengcai told reporters in a later interview.
”他用“祖国有招，我必到！”来形容自己的决心。
He describes his determination in terms of "Motherland, I will come!"
副驾驶熊楚英告诉记者，出发前自己没敢告诉自己的老母亲这趟任务是要去武汉疫情区，“不想让家人担心”。
Xiong Chu-ying, deputy pilot, told reporters that before leaving did not dare to tell his mother this mission is to Wuhan epidemic area, "do not want to worry their families."
跟时间赛跑问起王慎才知不知道“这10万只口罩的意义”。
When asked about Wang Shen in a race against time, he did not know "the significance of these 100,000 masks."
王慎才就说了句，“他们（武汉人）需要。
Wang Shen just said, "They need it.
”当天夜里，即1月25日24时，国家卫健委官报告30个省（区、市）累计报告新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎确诊病例1975例。
That night, at 2400 hours on January 25, the State Health Officer reported a cumulative total of 1975 cases of confirmed pneumonia with a new coronavirus infection in 30 provinces (districts and municipalities).
较1月24日24时增长1309例，增长101.71%。
This represents an increase of 101.71 per cent over the increase of 1,309 cases at 2400 hours on 24 January.
随着确诊病例迅速增长，前线医疗物资告急。
With the rapid increase in confirmed cases, front-line medical supplies are at risk.
由于缺乏口罩和防护服等医疗物资，有些医务人员甚至直接暴露在新型冠状病毒面前。
Due to the lack of medical supplies such as masks and protective clothing, some medical personnel were even directly exposed to the new coronavirus.
10万只口罩，对于正在与病毒展开生死搏斗的一线医务人员来说格外重要。
One hundred thousand face masks are especially important for front-line health workers who are struggling with the virus.
“水都来不及喝。
"There's no time to drink.
”王慎才和熊楚英用行动表达了他们对“他们需要”的理解。
By their actions, Wang Shen-cai and Xiong Chu-ying expressed their understanding of "what they need."
他们开着车飞驰在高速路上，“我们越快，他们就越平安。
They were speeding down the highway, "The faster we go, the safer they'll be.
”出门前，王慎才查了路线，从安徽宁国到武汉600多公里的路程，如果快的话，8个小时就够了。
Before leaving the gate, Wang Shen checked the route from Ningguo, Anhui Province, to Wuhan, which is more than 600 kilometers away.
但因为是夜里开车，加上有些地方下小雨、小雪，从宁国到铜陵、安庆，经九江，横穿安徽、江西、武汉三省，到达武汉东西湖区卫生健康局，他们奔驰了近12个小时。
But because it was driving at night, and because of the light rain and snow in some places, from Ningguo to Tongling and Anqing, through Jiujiang, across Anhui, Jiangxi and Wuhan provinces, to Wuhan East-West Lake Health Bureau, they Mercedes-Benz for nearly 12 hours.
（疫区一线医务人员在等，风雨不能阻挡他们的脚步）1月26日凌晨2点多，王慎才看到了湖北的省界。
(First-line medical staff in the affected areas are waiting, the storm can not stop their footsteps) January 26, more than 2: 00 a.m., Wang Shen saw Hubei Province boundaries.
他赶紧叫醒了身边的同伴，提醒对方戴起口罩。
He quickly wakes up his companion to remind him to wear a mask.
王慎才后来回忆，高速出口格外安静，警示灯一闪一闪，在雨中看起来异常吓人。
Wang Shengcai later recalled that high-speed exit exceptionally quiet, warning lights flash, in the rain looks very frightening.
“一方有难 八方支援”“高速路出口，好几辆警车停在那，灯一闪一闪的。
"There's a lot of support on one side." "There were several police cars parked there, lights flashing.
问我们是从哪里来的，车上装的什么。
Ask us where we came from and what we had in the car.
”回忆起当时的情形，熊楚英仿佛还有一丝紧张，“知道我们是来送口罩的，交警热情起来，给我们开了特别通行证。
"Xiong Chu-ying, recalling the situation, seemed a little nervous." Knowing we were here to deliver masks, the traffic police enthusiastically issued us a special pass.
”之后，王慎才才知道，有了这张特别通行证，他那辆9米6的“大家伙”可以直接从市区穿过，“交警让我们从市区走，说是市区近，快一些。
"It was only later that Wang Shen realized that with the special pass, his 9-meter-6" big guy "could walk straight through the city.
”凌晨4点多的武汉市区，下着小雨。
It was raining in Wuhan, a city with a heavy rain.
行驶在武汉市区街道上，王慎才看到，“街道两边有几家超市在营业，还有几个环卫工人在清扫街道。
Driving through the streets of Wuhan city, Wang Shen noticed that several supermarkets were open on both sides of the street and several sanitation workers were sweeping the streets.
”很快，他们的车就到了武汉东西湖区卫生健康局。
Soon their car was at the Wuhan East-West Lake District Health and Wellness Bureau.
“打完电话不久，东西湖区救援应急中心负责人就来了，隔着口罩和我们说，辛苦了！他招呼了几个人，我们一起赶紧把货卸了。
"Shortly after the call, the head of the Rescue Emergency Center in the East and West Lake Region came and told us through the mask that he had worked hard.
”那时，王慎才的心悬着的心慢慢放下来。
At that time, Wang Shen-cai's heart was hanging down slowly.
（10万只口罩顺利到达武汉东西湖区卫生健康局，王慎才他们在卸口罩）被问及有没有在武汉吃饭，熊楚英表示，“任务完成了，我们俩就想着赶紧回家。
When asked if they had eaten in Wuhan, Xiong Chu-ying said, "When the mission was done, we decided to hurry home.
”“出城的时候，或是担心警察不让我们出去，应急中心的负责人开着小车在前面给我们带路，一直把我们送到高速路口。
"" When we were out of town, or afraid the police wouldn't let us out, the head of the emergency center drove the car in front of us and took us all the way to the motorway.
”王慎才说道。
"said Wang Shen-cai.
回程，对于王慎才他们来说，并不比“进城”轻松。
On the return trip, Wang Shengcai for them, no easier than "go to the city."
王慎才告诉记者，“在路上的时候，就有亲朋好友微信问我武汉那边的情况，建议我留在武汉隔离。
Wang Shen told reporters, "on the road, friends and relatives asked me about the situation on the other side of Wuhan, advised me to stay in Wuhan isolation.
”“其实，去的路上，我就想好了，回去直接在家隔离”。
"" Actually, on the way, I thought about it, and went straight to my house to be isolated.
王慎才很能够理解亲友们的担心。
Wang Shen understands the concerns of his relatives and friends.
而根据疾病预防控制局发布的《新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎可疑暴露者和密切接触者管理方案》（第二版），新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎，潜伏期最长约为14天，病例存在人传人情况，要求“与病人有接触，但没有采取有效防护或者有暴露可能的人群”进行14天的医学观察。
According to the Management Program for Suspected Exposed Persons and Close Contacts with New Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia (2nd Edition), a new coronavirus-infected pneumonia with latency of up to 14 days, human-to-human transmission of the case requires 14 days of medical observation.
“希望大家都能跨过这个坎，我呢，回家自我隔离，不给大家添麻烦。
"I hope that everyone can cross this bar, I, go home to self-isolation, do not cause trouble to everyone.
”王慎才说。
"said Wang Shengcai.
村里知道他运送口罩到武汉疫区的事情，特别安排医务人员每天来给他量体温，“说是要连续量14天，我现在身体挺好的”。
The village knew about his delivery of the mask to Wuhan affected areas, specially arranged for medical staff to take his temperature every day, "said 14 days in a row, I am in good health.
而对于王慎才的“隔离”，他妻子给了这样的答案：“以往，他初七、初八就要上班，现在能在家里多陪陪我们，挺好的。
Wang Shengcai's "isolation", his wife gave such an answer: "In the past, he will work in the seventh, eighth, and now can accompany us more at home, quite good.
”副驾驶熊楚英则选择独自在家隔离，“家里有个4岁的孩子，去武汉前把他托给我父母照顾，我父母家和我家，骑电动车只要5分钟，但最近我们大多数时候通过电话聊天。
"Xiong Chu-ying, a co-pilot, chose to stay at home alone." We had a four-year-old child who was entrusted to my parents before going to Wuhan.
”当熊楚英的孩子问起，“爸爸去哪儿了”。
When Xiong Chu-ying's child asked, "Where's Dad?
熊楚英说，“爷爷奶奶会告诉他爸爸去送货去了。
Xiong Chu-ying said, "Grandma and Grandpa will tell his father to deliver the goods.
”相信，随着熊楚英的孩子慢慢长大，能够明白“武汉疫情时期”父亲逆行的意义。
"I believe that as Xiong Chu-ying's children grow up, they can understand the significance of his father retrograde during the" Wuhan epidemic. "
“去武汉送货，那是一方有难、八方支援。
"To Wuhan delivery, that is a difficult, eight-way support.
回家了，得多替家乡人考虑。
Go home, have to think more for home people.
”王慎才在采访的最后说道。
"Wang Shen-chai concluded the interview.
