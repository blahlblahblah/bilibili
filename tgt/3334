本    文  约   4200  字阅  读  需  要8min900万武汉人，就有900万种不同的形态，即使他们被关在了这座修罗场：有的人是受害者，有的人是幸存者……还有其他的人在帮助别人和自己努力活下去。
There are nine million different forms of the 89 million Wuhan people who need to read and read. Even if they are locked up in this workshop, some are victims, others are survivors... and others are helping others and trying to survive on their own.
黄佳丽的镜头里面没有惨烈的生死离别，但是对普通人这些平淡的记录反而更衬托出潜伏在下面的残酷巨涡，这是一份最真实的记录，她也好，其他记录者也好，这些涓涓细流，或许有一天，终将勾勒出来历史的真相。
It is the truest record of the brutal vortex lurking below, not in the sad life-or-death of Huang Jiali's scenes, but the plain record of the common man may one day reveal the truth of history, both for her and for others.
P.S.文章阅读结束不要忘记点击文末的3分钟视频《武汉围城的日和夜》.3月11号，武汉封城的第49天，黄佳丽用视频记录封城后志愿者生活的第20天。
Wuhan on March 11, the 49th day of the city's closure, Huang Jiali video recorded the 20th day of volunteer life after the city was closed.
这二十天里面，她手机拍摄的照片和视频那个文件夹，已经有2500多个文件了。
Over the past twenty days, her cell phone has taken photos and videos of that folder, which has had more than 2,500 files.
作为志愿者，她参与过对接国外医疗物资、接送医护人员、运送物资、去菜地挖菜、给狗送狗粮、为社区老人送菜等等。
As a volunteer, she has been involved in docking foreign medical supplies, transporting medical personnel, carrying supplies, digging vegetable fields, delivering dog food to dogs, delivering food to elderly people in the community, etc.
从美国读书之后回到家乡的这一年多，她原本焦躁、不安，经常因为生活方式的不习惯而和人发生口角，这一次疫情发生之后，她突然看到了武汉城不一样的地方：“感觉和这座城市有了某种羁绊。
More than a year after studying in the United States and returning to her hometown, she was fretful, restless and often quarrelled with people because of lifestyle habits. After the outbreak, she suddenly saw Wuhan city differently: "I feel a bit tied up with the city.
”让黄佳丽找找做志愿者服务状态的照片，她只翻到这张和医生的合影（右一为黄佳丽），这也是这次疫情的遗憾之一：认识了很多朋友，但都不知道将来有一天在路上遇见还能不能认出来（脱了口罩后）1、“想为他们做点事情”黄佳丽是学艺术的，此前在达拉斯一所大学读书，更早之前她曾在一个艺术家工作室工作过，也曾经参与过《南方车站的聚会》美术组工作。
Let Huang look for pictures of herself serving as a volunteer. She only turned to this photo with a doctor (Huang Jiali on the right), one of the regrets of the outbreak: she knew many friends, but didn't know if she could recognize them one day.
说到底，她觉得自己是个普通得不能再普通的年轻人，除了爸爸妈妈、弟弟，以及其他亲人们，她在这座城市几乎没有什么朋友。
After all, she felt like such an average teenager that she had few friends in the city except her parents, younger brother and other relatives.
直到1月23号封城那天，她都没觉得有那么严重，虽然早就从网络上了解了若干信息，但是“周围的人太平静了，也就被感染得没什么感觉，甚至还在想，封城是不是有点夸张了呢？”1月23号，武汉封城第一天，早上八九点的路口，并没有特别恐慌的感觉，那时候看上去车还不少。
Even on January 23, the day after the city was closed, she didn't feel as bad as that. Although she had been able to get some information from the Internet for a long time, "the people around her were so calm that they became infected and even wondered if it was a little exaggerated.
在此之前，她已经开始零碎地记录下来身边的事、物。
Before that, she had begun to keep a fragmentary record of things and things around her.
除夕那天，她和弟弟出门转悠，“整个武汉城都没有声音，所有的店铺都关了门，只有花店的门开着，但是门口摆的全是菊花。
On New Year's Eve, she and her brother walked around. "The whole city was silent. All the shops were closed, except for the florist whose door was open, but which was covered with chrysanthemums.
天天关在家里，楼上15楼已经有邻居确诊，每天都被焦虑所包围，同一个小区听说还有两个人跳楼自杀，因为太抑郁了，所有人都在担忧一个问题：病毒的传播途径到底是什么？除夕夜，武汉的街道只有花店开着，堆满了献给逝者的那种菊花。
Every day in the home, upstairs 15 has been confirmed neighbors, daily anxiety surrounded by the same neighborhood, the same community heard that two people jumped suicide, because of depression, all worried about the way: What exactly is the transmission of the virus? On New Year's Eve, Wuhan's streets are filled with chrysanthemums dedicated to the dead.
除夕夜，路过武昌站，黄佳丽没敢下车，平时人满为患的车站此时充溢着一种空寂的恐怖。
New Year's Eve, passing Wuchang Station, Huang Jiali did not dare to get off, usually crowded station at this time filled with an empty fear.
2月21号因为有个群招志愿者去机场接来驰援的医疗队，那是黄佳丽隔离很多天以来第一次出门。
February 21 because of a group of volunteers to pick up the medical team arrived at the airport, it is the first time Huang Jiali isolation in many days.
她穿上雨衣、戴上口罩，还有手套，其实脑子都是木的，一个比较有经验的志愿者对她们说过，“如果你们不是单身的，独自一个人居住的，也不是身体条件比较好的，就不要来做志愿者了，风险还是很大的。
She was wearing a raincoat, a mask and gloves, but her brain was wooden. A more experienced volunteer told them, "If you are not single, living alone, and not in better physical condition, don't volunteer.
”她负责接送的是河北医疗队，去之前看了一下名单，85后的占多数。
"She was in charge of the Hebei medical team, and after checking the list, 85 she was in the majority.
有个很年轻的医护人员问她：“现在情况怎么样了？”根据志愿者接机要求，志愿者不方便回答太多关于武汉疫情的情况，以免引起医护人员的恐慌，她说：“医院内部的情况我不是很了解。
A very young medical worker asked her, "How is it going?" Volunteers were asked not to respond to the request for more information about the Wuhan epidemic, so as not to cause panic among medical staff.
”在机场去酒店的路上，她尽量给大家介绍武汉的沿途风景放松心情。
"On the way to the hotel at the airport, she tried to introduce the scenery along Wuhan to relax her mind.
接到了医护人员，他们基本都是统一的服装，有人一到酒店就问，“哪里有剃头的地方吗？”莫名地心疼他们。
Received medical personnel, they are basically uniform clothing, someone arrived at the hotel and asked, "Where there is a place to shave?" inexplicably love them.
正在理发的医护人员，一只手还不忘记扶着口罩“其实刚封城的几天，武汉感觉是一种无政府状态，谁都没准备好去面对一个闹不清的局面”，黄佳丽说，“那段时间城市的运转大多数是靠志愿者，就连关卡都是民兵在守。
"For a few days, Wuhan felt like a state of anarchy, and no one was ready to face a confused situation," says Huang. "During that time, the city was run mostly by volunteers, even by the militia.
”志愿者们去菜地收菜，送给那些需要的人，比如小区里行动不便的老人从那天开始，直到今天，她参与了无数个志愿者团队，每天都在城市里面穿梭。
Volunteers collected vegetables from vegetable fields and sent them to people in need, such as elderly people with reduced mobility in the neighborhood who began that day and continue to this day to participate in countless volunteer teams that travel through the city every day.
不管走到哪里，她都坚持用手机记录下来身边的一切。
Wherever she went, she insisted on keeping track of everything around her on her mobile phone.
她还记得一个护士朋友告诉她，有天去某个医院，发现有四具尸体停在那里，有一具尸体都流水了，看样子肯定超过了20个小时。
She also remembers a nurse friend telling her that one day she went to a hospital and found four bodies lying there, one of them flowing, which must have been more than 20 hours old.
而没有经过消毒处理的尸体是不能送去殡仪馆的，但是没办法，在最初那些混乱的日子里，医院里所有的清洁工、临时工都辞职了。
Bodies that had not been disinfected could not be sent to the funeral home, but there was no way to do so. In the early days of chaos, all the cleaners and temporary workers in the hospital resigned.
医务工作者们每天下班后还要自己打扫科室卫生。
Medical workers have to clean their own offices after work every day.
她说自己没怎么想过为什么要做志愿者，就是觉得不能坐以待毙，“如果一线的医护人员这道防线倒下，那该怎么办呢？也很心疼那些医护人员，希望为他们做些事情，但是又很无力。
She said she didn't think much about volunteering, but thought she could not just sit tight, "What if the front-line line of health care workers falls down?" She said she loved the paramedics and wanted to do something for them, but was powerless.
”志愿者们给医护人员送去了热干面2、“我难过是因为李文亮也是个普通人”在人生的前几十年，黄佳丽都过得比较顺，在美国遇到了一些事情，回到武汉，想在这里休整一下。
The volunteers gave the paramedics hot, dry noodles. "I am sad because Li Wenliang is also an ordinary person." In the first decades of her life, Miss Huang had a better life.
突发的疫情让她对很多事情的认识在慢慢改变。
The sudden outbreak is slowly changing her perception of many things.
2月14日，武汉狂风暴雨，路边的树都被连根拔起。
February 14, Wuhan, the storm, the roadside trees were uprooted.
2月15日，武汉2020年的第一场降雪，红绿灯是此时这座城市唯一剩下的颜色。
Wuhan, February 15, the first snow in 2020, traffic lights is the city's only remaining color.
比如她一直觉得武汉是个“没有颜色”的城市，她拍下来的凌波门、无人的路口，都呈现烟雨蒙蒙的灰色质。
For example, she has always thought Wuhan is a "no color" city, she photographed the Lingbo Gate, no one's intersection, are showing a hazy gray.
她觉得任何颜色都炸眼，她喜欢看小众的法国电影，原本打算春节过后去北京工作。
She thinks any color is blinding, she likes to watch the small number of French movies, originally planned to work in Beijing after the Spring Festival.
每天奔波忙碌，3月10号，她去了凌波门，以前那是个很热闹的地方，新人们喜欢在那里拍婚纱照，现在满眼看去，一片荒凉。
On March 10, she went to Lingbo Gate, a busy place where young people used to take wedding photos. Now they see it all in desolation.
武汉大学的凌波门，旁边就是东湖，平日很多新人拍婚纱照会在这里取景。
Wuhan University Lingbo Gate, next to the East Lake, usually many new wedding photography will be here to set the scene.
3月10日，这里空无一人。
On 10 March, there was no one here.
但是有趣的是，她发现身边的小动物多了起来：空旷的街道，鸟叫声越来越响亮，湖上居然有很多鱼在月光下跳来跳去，就像充满了神性。
But interestingly, she found that there were more and more small animals around her: open streets, more and more loud bird calls, and more fish hopping about in the moonlight, as if they were full of divinity.
也就是这一天，听说同一个车队有志愿者确诊了，因为不知道具体是谁，大家都在猜。
On that day, I heard that some volunteers in the same team had been diagnosed, because we didn't know who it was. Everyone was guessing.
回家的路上觉得本着通风的原则呢，应该把窗户打开，可是又不愿意浪费聊天的机会，因为车开快了，窗户开着风声又大，于是纠结中窗户开了又关，关了又开。
On the way home, I thought I should open the window, but I didn't want to waste the chance to talk, because the car was moving fast and the windows were blowing loudly.
她吃素，原本并不渴望什么美食，但是这天的志愿服务结束之后，她们点了一份饺子，“天啦，这是这么长时间以来我第一次点到外卖。
She was a vegetarian and didn't long for anything gourmet, but when the volunteer service ended, they ordered a dumpling. "My God, this is the first time I've ordered a takeaway in so long.
”她特别欢欣雀跃，也就是这个时候，我才从她那些略微沉重的照片里想起来，她还只是个花样年华的女孩嘛。
She was particularly elated, and it was then that I remembered from her slightly heavy photographs that she was a young girl.
黄佳丽生活照她曾经在美国遇到过危险，好朋友送了她一个哨子，让她用来保护自己。
Huang Jiali lives according to she once met danger in the United States, good friend gave her a whistle, let her use to protect themselves.
李文亮医生去世那天，她在家大哭，然后录下了一段吹响哨子的视频。
On the day Dr. Lee died, she cried at home and recorded a video of the whistle blowing.
Play这是疫情期间令她最难过的事情。
Play It was the worst thing that ever happened to her during the epidemic.
“我难过不是因为他是个医生，而是因为他是个和我们一样的普通人。
"I am sad not because he is a doctor, but because he is a common person like us.
”3、“每一个普通人都令人动容”仅仅拍摄了几天之后，这些照片开始有了一个模糊的主题方向：她的镜头里面开始出现大量的普通人，各行各业在武汉的人。
After only a few days of shooting, the photos began to take a hazy thematic direction: There were a lot of ordinary people in her shot, people from all walks of life in Wuhan.
比如一个清洁工，穿着防护服在叠一张席子，不知道为什么，她突然就很着迷：“我站在那里一直看他，拍了整整四分钟。
For example, a dustman, wearing a protective suit and folding a mat, suddenly became fascinated: "I stood there watching him for four minutes.
”有一个给医院做了三千杯奶茶的志愿者，不好意思面对她的拍摄，总是很羞涩地低下头，黄佳丽说：“我抓拍了好多这样的普通人，都不是正脸，也不是摆拍，但我很喜欢。
One volunteer, who made 3,000 cups of milk tea for the hospital, was too shy to face her and always looked down sheepishly. "I caught a lot of these ordinary people," she said.
”做奶茶的志愿者，被拍时不是把脸侧过去，就是用手挡住脸，是那种朴实无华的年轻人有一个镜头记录了小区里看上去特别平淡的一对老年人，一个老爷爷在遛狗，旁边还有一个老太太，那天之后，黄佳丽再也没有见过他们，“听说他俩中有一个后来跳楼了，可当时拍下来的，是多么安逸静谧的画面啊……”她很难忘记一个货车司机，那是个河南人，每次都会一遍遍追问他们：装好了没有，不会出问题吧？我可要负责的哦。
The volunteers were photographed either with their faces turned aside or with their hands over their faces. There was a scene of a particularly plain-looking old man in the neighborhood, an old man walking the dog, and an old lady next to them.
“大多数的货车司机只负责装货，他每次都帮忙，特别难得。
"Most truck drivers are only responsible for loading, and he's very rare for his help every time.
”黄佳丽说，司机也告诉她说，有一次就是他接了出城的货。
Huang said the driver also told her he had once picked up goods from the city.
结果后来出了武汉，进不来了，就一直在车上冻了一晚上。
As a result, out of Wuhan, can not enter, on the car has been frozen all night.
他的车特别破，但是他人特别温暖。
His car is very broken, but he is very warm.
热心负责的货车司机她还注意到了坐在地上的一个大叔，他当时来武汉，是打算从武汉中转去海南的。
She also noticed a big uncle sitting on the ground, who had come to Wuhan with the intention of making his way to Hainan from Wuhan.
结果经过武汉就要中转的时候，武汉封城了，他哪也去不了，也没有人管他，他突然就变成了一个流浪街头的人。
As a result, when Wuhan was about to transit, Wuhan closed the city, he could not go anywhere, no one cares about him, he suddenly became a street person.
“那天我出去拍的时候碰到他，然后我就给他留了些吃的。
"I ran into him the other day while I was out shooting, and then I left him something to eat.
不过听说从3月1号开始，政府已经在收留这样的人了，像他这种情况的应该是能拿到十天3000块钱的补助，或者是每天包吃包住，一直到封城结束。
But I hear that the government has been taking in people like him since March 1st. In his case, he should get a 10-day allowance of 3,000 yuan, or wrap it up every day until the city is closed.
”被迫流浪在武汉的人我追问过她的政治倾向，她说对这些不感冒，但她觉得，和集体的宏大叙事相比，她更看重的是人与人之间的联系：“从个体身上才能读到时代的命运。
Forced to wander in Wuhan I asked her about her political leanings, and she said she was not impressed by them, but felt she valued human contact more than the collective grand narrative: "You can read the destiny of the times from the individual.
”所以她不想看到更多对牺牲的赞美，“感动这种词有时候显得太塑料了，它是个很没用的词，背后有太多悲情的东西。
"So she didn't want to see more praise of sacrifice." Moving the word sometimes seemed too plastic, it was a useless word, and there was so much sadness behind it.
我不认为集体是力量的来源，我尊重每一个生命个体。
I do not believe that the collective is a source of strength, I respect each individual life.
”志愿者们在搬运物资，一天搬了四百多箱因为大家都不能出行，这位司机就在小区门口等着需要的人叫他，他会帮人买药、送人去医院等等。
"Volunteers were carrying supplies, carrying more than 400 boxes a day and because no one could get around, the driver waited at the gate of the neighborhood for someone to call him and he would buy medicine and take people to the hospital.
为了预防病毒，他把车窗打开，防护服晾在后备箱上。
To guard against the virus, he opened the window and hung the suit on the trunk.
当然也有过小插曲，有一天她经过华南海鲜市场，想去拍几张今时今日，结果发现市场已经被封了，有人在大声呵斥：“拍什么拍？你是哪个国家派来的间谍？”这件事以后她变得谨慎了一些，不敢告诉别人自己在国外读过书，但转念一想，自己又没有做错过什么。
One day she passed the South China seafood market and wanted to take some pictures of it today, only to find that the market had been closed and someone yelled: "What's the pat? What country are you sending for?" She became cautious after the incident and didn't dare to tell anyone that she had read a book abroad.
那就继续拍吧，用保鲜膜当作护目镜的售货员、水果店的老板娘、蹲在地上吃饭的志愿者……有的时候用专业一点的相机，大多数时候还是靠手机完成。
So go ahead and use the cling film as a goggles shop assistant, fruit shop lady, squatting volunteers... sometimes with a professional camera, most of the time still rely on mobile phones.
她不做剪辑，只为记录。
She doesn't make clips, just for the record.
包括拍下了一个公车司机说的一段话，大意是说，“我们现在都应该是过命的交情了，尤其是经历过这样的事情～”公交司机：“我们现在都应该是过命的交情了”。
"We're supposed to be fated friends now, especially after things like" bus drivers: "We should all be lucky friends now," says one bus driver.
超市里卖鱼的婆婆没有护目镜，就拿保鲜膜保护眼睛。
Supermarket sales of fish mother-in-law do not have goggles, take plastic film to protect their eyes.
当时，超市虽然播放着清新活泼的音乐，但是现场一点新年的气氛都没有。
At that time, although the supermarket broadcast fresh and lively music, but the scene a little bit of the atmosphere of the New Year.
大家都默默保持距离，静悄悄地买菜。
Everyone kept silence and quietly bought some vegetables.
蹲在路边吃饭的志愿者只是，她自己大概也没有察觉到，她的镜头不知不觉呈现了灰色调之外的颜色，通过这些视频，原本“疏离”的她已经与所有的这些普通人建立了联系。
The volunteer squatting on the side of the road just, she probably did not notice, her lens imperceptibly took on a color other than gray, through which "alienated" she had established contact with all these ordinary people.
黄佳丽说：“这次让我觉得比较动容的就是，每一个普通人都非常了不起。
"What makes me feel so moved this time is that every ordinary person is great," Huang said.
其实并没有大英雄，都是普通人，但他们都是特别了不起的力量。
There are no great heroes, they are all ordinary people, but they are all extraordinary forces.
