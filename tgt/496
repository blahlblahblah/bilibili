If so, it will cause many countries and regions around the world to further justify restrictions on China's trade and exports, as well as further suspension or cancellation of maritime transport, flights, etc., and the economic impact will be even greater and deeper than at present.

这次决定主要是为了支持其他弱小一些没这么强抗疫能力的国家，并希望各国不要采取不必要的限制措施，比如全面限制签证、或对健康人士也采取隔离等……WHO也评论了最近各国一些航班暂停的问题：很多航班减少或暂停的原因说是因为需求下降而不是因为病毒，WHO无法控制是否能说服他们，但会持续和大家交流，希望不要采取不必要的限制措施。
The decision was mainly to support other weaker and less resilient countries, and it was hoped that countries would refrain from imposing unnecessary restrictions, such as blanket visa restrictions or isolation of healthy individuals...

The Daily Show, a popular talk show in the United States, featured a special commentary on the epidemic, citing the fact that only China has 10 days to build a 10-bed hospital.

Professor Lipkin, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University known as Virus Hunter, who traveled to China to help with SARS in 2003 and Wuhan on January 28, is also a force to be reckoned with.
但WHO宣布疫情为PHEIC后，还有待观察美国会有什么举措。
But after the WHO declared the outbreak PHEIC, it remains to be seen what the United States will do.
比如美国时间1月30日WHO宣布的当天，美国政府将前往中国的旅行警告调整为4级了，即最高等级：不要前往。

美国医院告示民间的话，美国防疫宣传工作还是做得蛮到位的，CDC官网上有多语种的一系列防御措施。
American hospitals to announce the word, the United States vaccination campaign is still in place, CDC officials on the Web a range of multilingual defense measures.
各大医院也都贴出了告示，表示如果是武汉过来的，有症状要及时电话医院，在医生的建议下采取措施。

San Francisco Street View "We're guarding against viruses, not the Chinese." I'm getting up every day to start brushing the country, greeting family and friends, and forwarding and docking some resources.

很多名校、社会机构的新春晚会，都临时取消了，比如硅谷地区最有名的斯坦福、伯克利两所大学的春晚，谷歌的员工组织的“载歌载舞”，都主动退票给大家。
The Spring Festival gala of many prestigious schools and social organizations, such as the Spring Festival Gala at two of Silicon Valley's most famous universities, Stanford and Berkeley, has been cancelled.
旧金山唐人街我有个在美国东部生活的学姐，她刚从上海过完春节回美，特地分享给我：“我们校区专门发信，近期从中国返回的学生，只要没有症状，就无需隔离。
San Francisco Chinatown I have a Chinese sister who has just returned to the United States from Shanghai for the Spring Festival. "Our campus specializes in sending letters to students who have recently returned from China and do not need isolation as long as they have no symptoms.
我给女儿学校写信，告知他们我们刚从中国回来，校长专门跟我讲，希望她能尽快返校，而且无需戴口罩，否则别的小朋友会产生疑问，她可能会难受。
I wrote to my daughter's school to let them know that we had just returned from China. The headmaster told me that she would like to go back to school as soon as possible without wearing a mask.
”不过也有位于加州的私立高中，已通知几位回中国的留学生暂时不要回美，并发教材让他们自学；UCSD加州大学圣地亚哥分校有5600名中国留学生，目前校方只是通知学生，在不必要的情况下避免前往中国。
But there are private high schools in California that have told students returning to China to stay away from the U.S. and teach them to study on their own, and 5,600 Chinese students at the University of California, San Diego, have been told not to travel to China without having to.
之后这些学校会有什么措施和影响，值得关注。
What measures and impact these schools will have after that deserve attention.
而另一封最近在华人圈广为转发的信中，最后两段话令人动容：“每个人都会生病，不要因此而孤立中国人，和任何你认为与中国有联系的人，更不要歧视生病的人，因为这样会让生病的人为自己生病而羞耻，从而隐瞒病情，不保护他人。
Another recent letter, widely circulated among the Chinese community, says the last two sentences are moving: "Everybody gets sick, so don't isolate the Chinese and anyone you think has connections with China, let alone discriminate against sick people, who can shame themselves by hiding their illness and not protecting others."
我们防的是病毒，而不是中国人。
We're defending the virus, not the Chinese.

The more at risk, the more need for calm, reason, humanity, unity.
”沈纯洁生活的旧金山湾区社区希望疫情能早日消散，还给大家一个安宁的春天。

目前德国四个确诊病例收治的医院外景，施瓦宾医院 慕尼黑讲述者：唐杰30+，建筑师📍德国慕尼黑1月29日早上，新型冠状病毒很快就在德国确诊了第一例患者，而且竟然还是一个德国人。
The new coronavirus was first diagnosed in Germany on the morning of January 29. The new coronavirus was first diagnosed in Germany and is still a German national.
据报道是一个德国公司的中国分公司的中国同事来德国开会，人传人的形式传染给了这名德国人。
It was reported that a Chinese colleague from the Chinese branch of a German company had come to Germany for a meeting and the person-to-person format had been transmitted to the German.
这名中国同胞也不是来自武汉，而是来自上海，只因为她来德国前，父母从武汉拜访了她。
The Chinese compatriot is not from Wuhan, but from Shanghai, because her parents visited her from Wuhan before she came to Germany.
就这么环环相扣，人人相传，新型冠状病毒第一例确诊了，就在我所在的城市，慕尼黑。
It's all connected. Everyone says that the first case of the new coronavirus was diagnosed in my city, Munich.
病人被隔离在离我家隔两站地铁的施瓦宾医院。
The patient was quarantined at Schwabin Hospital, two stations from my home.
就在短短几个小时之后，在当天深夜我写这篇日志的时候，又有三名德国人确诊感染，全为第一名感染者的40多个同事中的不幸中枪的人。
Just a few hours later, when I wrote this post late that night, three more Germans were diagnosed with the infection, all of them unfortunate gunmen among more than 40 colleagues of the first infected person.
1月29日一天之内，德国凭借4名病例，后来居上，超过法国的3名，成为欧洲被感染人数最多的国家。
On January 29, Germany, with four cases, came second, ahead of France's three, making it the most infected country in Europe.
（截至北京时间2月1日6时，德国已确诊第7例新冠肺炎患者，法国确诊6例。
(As of 6: 00 Feb. 1, Beijing time, Germany has confirmed the seventh case of New Crown Pneumonia, France confirmed 6 cases.
）德国柏林机场已经张贴了冠状病毒告示而同一个时间的新闻，德国决定30日派飞机从中国撤侨, 真乃兵贵神速。
A coronavirus notice was posted at the German airport in Berlin at the same time that Germany decided to send planes to evacuate overseas Chinese from China on the 30th.
祸不单行，我觉得之后德国媒体又要炸锅，就好像武汉封城，德国媒体所释放的那股劲头一样。
Misfortunes never come singly. I think the German media will blow up the pan again, just like Wuhan, the German media released the same momentum.
当然首先受到冲击的，就是像我一样在德国的中国人。
Of course, the first to be hit was the Chinese like me in Germany.
今天早上在电梯里，我和一个搬运工不期而遇，他先按了下，我后按了上，没想到电梯不按套路出牌缓缓开始上行。
This morning in the elevator, I and a porter happened to meet, he pushed first, I then pressed, did not expect the elevator in accordance with the set of cards slowly began to ascend.
于是我们俩尴尬的对视了一眼。
We both looked at each other awkwardly.
结果他迅速问了我一句，你是中国人么？我说是。
As a result, he quickly asked me, are you Chinese? I said yes.
他立刻大叫一声：“妈呀，冠状病毒！”于是把口鼻立刻藏在了衣服领子里，虽然故作夸张，但是认真严肃。
He immediately cried out: "Mum, coronavirus!" So he hid his mouth and nose in the collar of his clothes.
到了顶楼，我下了电梯，出去的时候丢了句：alles gute！（一切顺利！）类似的在海外发生的例子，这几天听得太多了。
When I got to the top of the building, I got off the elevator and went out with a phrase like Everything's going on overseas, I've heard too much about it these days.
因为这种病毒，中国人变成了位于德国的武汉人，武汉人在中国受到的各种冷遇，我们会在外国人的关照下同样经历一遍，甚至可能更惨。
Because of the virus, the Chinese have become Wuhan people in Germany, Wuhan people in China received the same kind of cold treatment, we will be under the care of foreigners under the same experience, and perhaps even worse.
1月30日下午，德国某药店门口，用中文写着“我们不再有口罩”自己前几天就在一个纽伦堡的中国朋友的提醒下，在网上下单了口罩，可是迟迟不见发货，于是决定去药店试试运气。
On the afternoon of January 30, at the door of a German drugstore, he ordered a mask in Chinese the other day at the behest of a Chinese friend at Nuremberg, but delayed delivery, so he decided to try his luck at the drugstore.
德国药店俯拾皆是，然而连去了几家，都被告知，口罩售罄。
German pharmacies abound, but even a few have been told that the masks were sold out.
甚至有的店你一进门，看你是中国人，都不用开口，售货员会主动告诉你：没有口罩。
Even some stores you enter, see you are Chinese, do not open your mouth, the salesperson will offer to tell you: no mask.
简单粗暴，倒也节省彼此的时间。
Simplicity saves each other's time.
后来我去的多了，也琢磨出来里面的味道。
Later I went to a lot of, but also out of the taste inside.
看他们的态度和口气，有些药店并不是没有口罩，而是不卖给中国人。
Judging by their attitude and tone, some pharmacies do not have masks, but do not sell to the Chinese.
想想也对，因为一旦口罩变成一种战略物资，那么他们肯定优先留给本国人使用，毕竟“ 地主家都没有余粮 ”。
Think of it, because once a mask becomes a strategic commodity, it must be left to the natives first, because there is "no surplus left in the landlord's house."
前几周在国内疫情爆发时，全世界的海外赤子以“一方有难，八方支援”的精神，以迅雷不及掩耳盗铃的速度，买光了全世界的口罩，德国也没办法幸免。
When the outbreak erupted a few weeks ago, the world's overseas bastards, in the spirit of "one-sided, eight-way support," rushed to buy all the world's masks, and Germany was not spared.
据说国内南方某学校的德国校友会，把德国DACH口罩厂的所有库存全部搬到了中国，所以如果真的疫情也要在欧洲蔓延，估计德国的口罩现在缺口也很大。
The German Alumni Association of a school in the south of the country is said to have moved all its stocks to China, so if a real outbreak is to spread in Europe, it is estimated that there are now large gaps in German masks.
德国海德堡大学医院内部其实以德国人的卫生习惯，一直是“没心没肺”的风格，真谈不上好。
Heidelberg University Hospital in Germany in fact to the German hygiene habits, has been "heartless" style, really not good.
我经常看到他们面包吃一半不小心掉在地上捡起来拍都不拍继续吃，或者苹果从超市买了撕了贴在上面的商标用袖口蹭一蹭就直接吃，这种“野生”的习惯一直让我觉得甘拜下风。
I often see them eat their bread half accidentally on the ground pick it up without patting, or apples from the supermarket tore the sticker on the brand and dabbed it directly with the cuffs, the "wild" habit has always made me feel humbled.
至于戴口罩，我觉得下雨打伞都嫌麻烦的德国人，戴口罩可能会比病毒更加会要他们的命。
As for wearing masks, I think the Germans, who are troubled by rain and parachuting, may be more likely to die from wearing masks than viruses.
所以我能想象未来街头上，带着口罩的中国人，出现的时候是如何的自带BGM。
So I can imagine how Chinese wearing masks would appear on the streets in the future with BGM.
截至北京时间2月1日6时，德国已确诊第7例新冠肺炎患者。
As of 0600 hours Beijing time on February 1, Germany has confirmed the seventh case of new crown pneumonia.
而德国巴伐利亚卫生部在当地时间1月29日宣布：德国此前确诊的4个患者，均已无新冠肺炎临床症状。
The Bavarian Health Ministry said on the 29 January local time: Germany previously diagnosed four patients, have no clinical symptoms of pneumonia.
之后如连续两天病毒测试为阴性，就可以出院了。
After two consecutive days of negative virus testing, you can be discharged.
但是有一点好的是，德国医生一向即使头疼脑热也不给病人开药的“优良传统”，可能客观上提高了德国人的抵抗力。
But the good news is that German doctors, who traditionally do not prescribe medicine to patients even for headaches and fever, may have objectively increased the resistance of Germans.
就好像我去年得了甲流在家高烧一周，卧床两周，感觉都快挂了，医生也就是嘱咐我多喝水，然后坚决不给我开任何药。
It was as if I'd had a fever at home for a week and was in bed for two weeks last year, and the doctor was telling me to drink more water and insisted that I not be prescribed any medicine.
竟然我也就在这磨磨唧唧中“起死回生”。
It was in this grind that I came back from the dead.
所以“野生”说不定也有“野生”的好处。
So "wild" may also have "wild" benefits.
至于整个德国的卫生防疫系统，会在这么一场病毒面前表现如何，我不知道，拭目以待。
As for the entire German health and epidemic prevention system, I do not know how to behave in the face of such a virus, it remains to be seen.
只敢贴在家里的自制春联讲述者：许晨猷23岁，普通IT白领📍日本东京我和女朋友两个人住在东京，我工作她读书，日本春节不放假，所以我们也都没能回去。
My girlfriend and I live in Tokyo and I live in Tokyo. I work. She attends school and the Japanese Spring Festival is not a holiday, so we can't go back either.
本来在日本就没什么春节气氛，写了幅春联贴在门口，结果女朋友回家看到指着我鼻子骂：万一被邻居知道了我们是中国人，把我们隔离开怎么办。
There was no Spring Festival atmosphere in Japan, wrote a spring couplet posted at the door, the girlfriend came home and pointed at my nose scolded: in case the neighbors know we are Chinese, how to separate us.
行吧，那就贴门里面吧。
All right, let's get inside the door.
疫情对我最大的影响是：手机流量用得多了。
The biggest impact of the epidemic on me was that mobile phone traffic was much more used.
每天上班都心不定，一有时间就摸鱼看看疫情怎么样了。
Every day at work are uncertain, every time you have time to fish to see how the outbreak.
日本同事也会问问我们中国的情况，不过关注疫情的大多还是中国人，毕竟自己的家人还都在国内。
Japanese colleagues will also ask us about China, but it is mostly the Chinese who are concerned, after all, that their families are still at home.
现在我每天的任务就是和家里长辈视频聊天，“拉帮结伙”地给他们灌输防范疫情的知识。
Now my daily task is to chat with the family elders video, "gang up" to inculcate their knowledge of the epidemic prevention.
公司人事部忙疯了，先不说春节回国的同事是不是还回得来，从中国返日的员工都要先去体检，等体检结果出来了才能回来上班，很多会议都要延期。
The company's personnel department is busy, not to mention the Spring Festival return home colleagues are not returned, staff from China to check-up, until the results of the medical examination come back to work, many meetings have to be postponed.
不过公司也表示可以理解，说这是为了大家安全所采取的措施，反过来安慰我们这些继续上班的人。
But the company also said it understood that it was a safety measure, which in turn comforted those of us who continued to work.
我们公司中国人挺多的，这群以前从来不戴口罩的人，现在在办公室里一整天都戴着口罩。
We have a large number of Chinese people in our company. Those who have never worn masks before now wear masks in the office all day.
说来昨天去公司楼下吃中华料理，那家店的上海老板娘也开始戴口罩了，这一波传染病防范意识真的很到位。
Yesterday to the company downstairs to eat Chinese cuisine, that shop's Shanghai board also began to wear masks, this wave of infectious disease prevention awareness is really in place.
日本邮局贴出申明：暂时停止发往中国大陆、中国香港的国际快递日本药妆店里的口罩被抢购一空自己身在“口罩大国”，想着给亲朋好友寄一些回去，结果根本抢不到，药妆店和便利店的口罩柜都空了。
