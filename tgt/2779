燃财经（ID:rancaijing）原创作者 | 孔明明编辑 | 周昶帆疫情之下，病毒肆虐，如何更安全地实现隔离，成了人们关注的重点。
With the outbreak of the virus at the hands of former creator and founder of Finance (ID: Rancaijing), attention has been focused on how to achieve greater security in the face of the ravages of the virus.
除了口罩、消毒液、护目镜等被抢断、线上电商订单激增之外，无人配送也在这非常时期被推至台前，进入到了大众视野。
In addition to masks, disinfectant, goggles and other snaps, online orders surged, undistributed in this extraordinary period was pushed into the public eye.
大型突发危机来临时，无人能提前预知，但“黑天鹅”事件的发生却会给行业发展进程带来变化。
When a major crisis comes, no one can predict in advance, but the occurrence of "black swan" will bring changes to the industry development process.
非典时期，SARS疫情促使京东完成了从线下到线上的决定性转变，阿里完成了从To B 到To C的决定性转变，“这次疫情一定会改变中国”，沄柏资本主席鲍毅认为，这次疫情会带来智慧革命的提速，人类会转向更智能化、更数字化、更充满智慧的方向去呼吸、去购物、去出行。
During SARS, the SARS epidemic pushed Jingdong to complete a decisive shift from under-line to on-line, and Ali completed a decisive shift from To B to To C, "an epidemic that would change China," according to Zheng Bo, chairman of Compaq Capital, who argued that the outbreak would speed up the intellectual revolution and shift humanity to smarter, more digital, and smarter ways to breathe, shop, and travel.
在疫情期间，大公司如京东、美团、苏宁、顺丰等派出了自己的无人配送机器人，许多创业公司如智行者、驭势科技等无人车公司也在疫情中发挥了作用。
During the epidemic, large companies such as Jingdong, the US Mission, Suning and Shunfeng sent their own unmanned robots, and many startups, such as Intelligent Traders and Crossing Technologies, played a role in the epidemic.
但无人配送作为一项仍待成熟完善的技术和应用，它真的能逐渐取代快递员、外卖员的位置，成为日常生活的新标配吗？如果是，我们还需要再等多久？“如果把无人配送比作沙滩上的一块宝石，这次疫情在带来配送员队伍潮落的同时，也让这块宝石凸显出来”，苏宁物流研究所副院长栾学锋告诉燃财经，“从无人配送成熟曲线来看，这次疫情虽没能直接推动无人配送技术的进步，但间接将无人配送的遐想空间激发了起来，大众认知也被刷新。
But as a technology and application that is still mature, can it gradually replace courier and take-out as a new standard in daily life? If undistributed people are likened to a gem on the beach, how long will we have to wait?
”“在未来的5-10年间，肯定会是无人配送机器人成熟的时候”，栾学锋说。
"In the next 5-10 years, it will definitely be time for unmanned robots to mature," Luan said.
索道投资创始合伙人石东华则认为，具有互联网和To C属性的服务机器人市场，相当于手机市场+汽车市场+第三代互联网市场，有望在未来成为继第一代PC互联网、第二代移动互联网之后的第三代机器人互联网。
Shi Donghua, founder partner of Cableway Investment, thinks the market for service robots with Internet and To C attributes, equivalent to mobile phone market + auto market + 3G Internet market, is expected to become the third generation robot Internet after the first generation PC Internet and the second generation mobile Internet.
疫情下的无人配送机器人无人超市项目星速购创始人姚锦程是在武汉1月23日封城的前一天开始感受到疫情的。
Yao Jincheng, founder of the unmanned robotic unmanned supermarket project under the epidemic, began to feel the epidemic the day before the city was closed on January 23 in Wuhan.
星速购是一家自己生产物流机器人的公司，同时也与酒店合作，在酒店内放置自己的无人货架并使用机器人进行配送。
Star Express is a company that makes its own logistics robots, and also works with hotels to put their own empty shelves and deliver them using robots.
2019年10月份，星速购在厦门磐基希尔顿酒店试运营自己的无人配送机器人3个月后，正准备趁着春节，跟全国范围内的酒店开展合作。
In October 2019, three months after starting a trial run of its own unmanned delivery robot at the Xiamen Panji Hilton Hotel, Starbucks is preparing to take advantage of the Spring Festival to work with hotels around the country.
得知疫情开始蔓延之后，姚锦程让公司员工采购了大批量口罩，并开始在合作酒店内为住客免费派发口罩，从1月23日到27日，陆续派发了近2000个口罩。
After learning that the epidemic was beginning to spread, Yao made the company's staff purchase large quantities of masks and began distributing free masks for residents at the hotel. From January 23 to 27, nearly 2,000 masks were distributed.
随着疫情越来越严重，酒店逐渐开始停业，星速购配送机器人合作的酒店无法继续开展业务，但姚锦程开始收到来自客户和朋友的邀约和建议。
As the epidemic deepens, hotels are winding down, and hotels that collaborate with StarCraft are no longer able to do business, but Yao is starting to receive offers and suggestions from customers and friends.
收治被隔离患者的酒店希望得到他们的捐赠，可以使用他们的无人配送机器人给住客派发生活物品，朋友则建议姚锦程将无人配送机器人捐赠给收治隔离患者的医院。
Hotels that treat quarantined patients want donations from them to distribute items to residents using their unmanned robots, while friends suggest Yao donate unattended robots to hospitals that treat isolated patients.
目前，星速购联合其他科技公司，已经向杭州萧山医院和厦门第一医院杏林分院捐赠了两台医务机器人，其中一台用来查房，另外一台可以送药和送物；同时他们也向武汉人民医院捐赠了同样的两台机器人。
The company, along with other technology companies, has donated two medical robots -- one for room inspection and the other for medicine and delivery -- to the Xiaoshan Hospital in Hangzhou and the Xinglin Branch of Xiamen Hospital No. 1, as well as to the Wuhan People's Hospital.
2月6日，在武汉市青山区吉林街上，一台京东无人配送车从京东物流仁和站出发，顺利将医疗物资送到了武汉第九医院。
February 6, Wuhan city, Qingshan Jilin Street, a Beijing-east unattended delivery vehicles from the Jing Dong logistics Renhe station, the smooth delivery of medical supplies to Wuhan ninth hospital.
武汉第九医院是武汉市收治新型冠状病毒感染肺炎患者的定点医院，是本次疫情核心区域的核心。
Wuhan No.9 Hospital is a designated hospital for treating patients with new coronavirus infection pneumonia in Wuhan, which is the core of the epidemic area.
京东物流武汉仁和站距离武汉第九医院只有600米，疫情爆发后，这个站点几乎支撑起了第九医院医疗物资的配送工作。
Jingdong logistics Wuhan Renhe station is only 600 meters away from Wuhan ninth hospital, the outbreak of the outbreak, this site almost supported the ninth hospital medical supplies distribution work.
据京东物流武汉青山分区经理周建斌介绍，目前他在武汉青山分区管辖的8个快递站点，快递员到岗率仅60%，且很多小区采取了封闭措施。
According to Zhou Jianbin, manager of Qingshan Division, Wuhan East Logistics Department, at present, he works in eight express delivery stations under the jurisdiction of Qingshan Division in Wuhan.
疫情爆发后，京东物流从北京紧急调配了两台L4级无人配送车到武汉，技术人员在北京通过云平台进行远程部署。
After the outbreak, Jing Dong Logistics dispatched two L4-class unmanned delivery vehicles from Beijing to Wuhan, where technicians deployed remotely via cloud platforms.
据周建斌介绍，目前京东无人车会先将第九医院对面三栋到四栋的小区订单筛选出来，快递员根据订单给无人车上货，最后再由无人车自动驾驶送货，每天根据下单量分几个拨次配载。
According to Zhou Jianbin, the Beijing-east unattended cars will first sift through three to four small area orders across from the Ninth Hospital. Express workers will give the orders to the unattended ones, and then automatically drive and deliver the goods by unmanned vehicles.
目前一辆京东无人车有24个格口，同时可以放24单，每次送货的设定时间为20-30分钟，通过短信或者京东App通知用户取单，30分钟后无人车自动返程。
At present, a Jingdong unmanned car has 24 ports, can put 24 at the same time, the time set for each delivery is 20-30 minutes, through SMS or the Beijing East App notify the user to collect the order, 30 minutes after the automatic return of the vehicle.
“货物这块根据实际情况分为大中小三类，如果货物超大放不了无人车，我们会选择人工去送，但一般情况下无人车都可以帮我们完成配送“，周建斌说。
"Goods can be divided into large, medium and small categories according to the actual situation. If the cargo is too big to hold an empty car, we will choose to send it manually, but in general, unmanned cars can help us complete the delivery," Zhou said.
京东物流X事业部自动驾驶研发部负责人孔旗称，目前第九医院的订单每天约为10单到20单，无人车可以送到一半或更多，“如果解禁之后，小一点的生活用品基本都可以采用无人车配送，用户需要一个养成习惯的阶段。
According to Kong Flag, head of auto-driving research and development at Beijing's X Business Division, orders for the ninth hospital now range from about 10 to 20 a day, with unattended cars delivering half or more.
”2月12日，一架顺丰无人机载着3.3公斤的医疗防疫物资降落在武汉金银潭医院，完成了武汉的首次配送；苏宁5G卧龙无人车也开始加码“无接触配送”。
On February 12, a Shunfeng drone carrying 3.3 kg of medical prophylactic supplies landed at Wuhan's gold and silver pool hospital, completing its first distribution in Wuhan.
苏宁5G卧龙无人车来源 /苏宁官方2月18日，美团宣布了无人配送车“魔袋”在北京顺义等多个社区投入运营，将会为在美团下单买菜的用户提供配送服务。
Suning 5G Wolong unmanned vehicle source / Su Ning official February 18, the United States announced that unmanned delivery vehicles "magic bags" in a number of communities in Beijing, such as Shunyi, will provide distribution services for customers ordering vegetables in the United States.
据美团官方数据显示，该无人配送车续航能力在100公里左右，一次最高能配送100KG的货物，在美团买菜的场景下每次可配送3-5个订单。
According to official U.S. Mission data, the unmanned delivery vehicle has a capacity of about 100 km, can deliver up to 100 KG of cargo at a time, and can deliver 3-5 orders at a time in the case of a US tour.
美团“魔袋” 来源/美团官方除了无人配送车外，无人机也屡次登上新闻。
In addition to unmanned delivery vehicles, drone strikes the news on numerous occasions.
比如公安会在高速路口或人群聚集区出动无人机实施空中巡逻震慑和督查，并实时回传画面，通过监控画面，操作人员可以及时劝导群众不聚集、戴口罩等；无人机的喊话器可以用来在道路或小区内播放防疫知识；还有无人机可以负责消毒、喷洒任务等。
For example, the public security organizations use drones to conduct air patrols at high-speed junctions or crowd-gathering areas to deter and supervise aerial patrols and transmit images back in real time. Through surveillance cameras, operators can persuade people not to gather and wear masks. Drone sirens can be used to broadcast epidemic prevention messages on roads or in small areas, and drones can be used to disinfect and spray.
疫情之下，线上电商订单激增、配送员人数不够、安全防范严格，虽然无人配送和智能机器人目前依然不能缺少人力协助，但仍缓解了部分人力紧缺和“接触传染”的压力，看似成为这一困境中的一剂“解药”。
The epidemic, with a surge in online orders, insufficient numbers of distribution workers, and stringent safety precautions, has eased some of the pressure on manpower shortages and "contact infections," even though unmanned and intelligent robots are still unable to rely on human help, and appears to be an antidote to this dilemma.
浮上水面的“宝石”“机器人在苏宁物流的场景里面一直都有应用，只不过借着疫情这次机会，机器人被凸显了出来，闪亮登场。
"Gem" on the surface "Robots have been used in Suning's logistics scene, only to take advantage of the epidemic to highlight the robot, shining on the scene.
“栾学锋说，自2018年以来，苏宁物流就开始在仓储、运输、配送等各个场景里面摸索各类机器人的应用。
Luan said that since 2018, Su Ning logistics began to explore various robot applications in storage, transportation, distribution and other scenarios.
在这个过程中，苏宁物流一直在做的事情是打磨测试机器人的稳定性，并没有急于铺开使用。
In this process, what Su Ning logistics has been doing is polishing and testing the stability of the robot, not rushing to roll it out.
“考虑到社会安全性和政府限制，我们沿着从点到线再到面的思路逐步铺开”，栾学锋介绍说，他们会在苏宁的办公园区，写字楼和苏宁小店配送场景下进行一些内部测试，锻炼机器人的能力，包括道路识别能力、异常情况诊断能力等，从而实现对配送场景的问题的持续挖掘和机器人控制技术的快速迭代。
"Taking into account social security and government restrictions, we gradually spread out from point to line and from side to side," Luan said. Luan said he would carry out some internal tests under the distribution scenarios of offices, offices and Suning stores in Suning.
周建斌称，在这次无人配送应用于武汉之前，他们已经在北京等地进行了近半年的实地派送测验，有了不少数据积累。
Zhou Jianbin said that before the undistributed application in Wuhan, they had been in Beijing and other places for nearly half a year of fieldwork testing, a lot of data accumulated.
他们在2019年年底的计划是，在2020年通过京东物流，选择一些城市和场景进行用户普及，疫情使得武汉优先级被提升，无人配送使用的紧迫程度也被提升。
Their plan by the end of 2019 is to popularize users in selected cities and scenes through the Beijing-East Logistics in 2020, with the epidemic raising Wuhan's priority and increasing the urgency of undistributed use.
“我们还有一些机器人的应用场景是送餐机器人，现在已经在一些餐馆开始使用，基于室内的配送技术我们也有相应的产品正在推进中”，孔旗说，“3月份我们会再继续投入，4月底我们会投入50辆，争取在今年实现投入到接近百辆的水平。
"We also have robot food delivery scenarios, which are already in use in some restaurants, and we have products based on indoor distribution technology," said Kong Flag. "We will continue to invest in them in March, and we will put in 50 by the end of April to achieve close to a hundred by the end of this year.
“从2016年开始，美团成立了W项目组，研发特定场景下的无人车配送，并在2017年将其提升为事业部。
"Starting in 2016, the Mission set up Project Team W to develop unmanned vehicles for delivery in specific scenarios and upgrade them to business in 2017.
2018年，美团举办了无人配送开放平台发布会，这一平台基于智能调度系统、美团云、大数据以及数据安全体系，把无人配送技术开放给供应链的上下游企业，并给予运营、商家、销售方面的支持。
In 2018, the USM hosted the launch of the Undistributed Open Platform, a platform based on intelligent dispatch systems, USM clouds, big data, and data security systems that open up unmanned distribution technologies to upstream and downstream companies in the supply chain, and provide operational, commercial, and marketing support.
同时，美团无人配送开放平台还联合擎朗科技、达闼科技等多家室内机器人公司，在酒店、餐厅等场景积极部署室内机器人，承担室内消毒、配送等服务工作。
At the same time, the United States Unmanned Delivery Open Platform also combines Optimus Prime technology, Dawei technology and other indoor robotic companies, such as hotels, restaurants and other scenes actively deployed indoor robots, indoor disinfection, distribution and other services.
2019年4月，美团成为国内第一家通过服务型电动自动行驶轮式车测试的企业，测试项目包括整车、配置、箱体、装配、自动驾驶能力等。
In April 2019, the Mission became the first company in the country to test a service-type electric self-propelled wheeled vehicle, including vehicle assembly, box body, assembly and automatic driving ability.
2020年1月，在美国拉斯维加斯举行的2020年国际消费电子展（CES）上，美团和供应商法雷奥共同推出了车长2.80米、宽1.20米、高1.70米的无人配送车法雷奥eDeliver4U，每次行程最多可配送17份外卖餐食。
In January 2020, at the 2020 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, the US mission and supplier Fabio unveiled the 2.80-metre, 1.20-metre-wide, 1.70-metre-high, unmanned delivery vehicle, Fareo Deliver4U, with a maximum delivery capacity of 17 takeaway meals per trip.
法雷奥eDeliver4U来源/法雷奥官网英诺天使基金合伙人祝晓成告诉燃财经，多年前他们已经开始关注工业机器人和民用机器人领域，从工业机器人领域投资开始，他观察到的是，“工业和民用领域的机器人都在发生非常大的变化，工业机器人国内目前已有多家上市公司，初创企业依然如雨后春笋，围绕机器人产业上下游的产业也非常活跃”。
Fareo Deliver4U Source / Fareo Archangel Fund Partner Zhu Xiaocheng told Flaming Finance that many years ago they had begun to focus on industrial robotics and civil robotics. Starting with industrial robotics, he observed that "robots in industry and civil use are changing very much.
噱头还是风口？“这是一个比较慢的赛道，但这个市场早晚会来”，从2014年就已经开始关注到服务类机器人和人工智能硬件化的石东华说。
"It's a slow track, but sooner or later the market will come," says Shi Donghua, who has been focusing on service robots and artificial intelligence hardware since 2014.
在祝晓成看来，通过行业内从业者们长期的努力，未来5年内，快递、物流、酒店等场景的无人配送机器人，电力等场所的巡检机器人，无人清扫机器人，无人农机等等会逐渐普及，但其他更复杂的应用场景，如医护、康复、佣人式机器人等仍可能需要10年以上的时间成熟并被广泛使用。
In Zhu Xiaocheng's view, through the long-term efforts of practitioners in the industry, unmanned robots in express delivery, logistics and hotels, patrol robots in places such as electric power, unmanned robots, unmanned farm machines, etc., will gradually become popular over the next five years, but other more complex applications, such as medical care, rehabilitation and domestic robots, could still take more than 10 years to mature and become widely used.
“这次疫情对机器人行业是一个催化剂，除了抗击疫情早日回归到正常工作和生活，大家也在思考，有没有机器人或者更智能的方式去代替或辅助人执行一些高危的工作？有没有更快更好的方法来研发药物和疫苗？”，祝晓成说，“这些都需要更多的技术研究和行业投入，也需要强需求的拉动；以前大家觉得医院来个机器人不一定好使，还会添乱，现在有强需求拉动，如果技术能快速迭代，产品化规模化做好，这些机器人场景和市场就会慢慢出现和成立。
"This epidemic is a catalyst for the robotics industry. Apart from fighting the epidemic and returning to normal work and life, we are also thinking about whether there are robots or more intelligent ways to replace or assist people in high-risk jobs.
”据IFR（International Federation of Robotics的简称，国际机器人联合会）2019年世界机器人报告显示，服务机器人在2019年销售额增长了32％，达到92亿美元，2018年销量增长了61％，达到271000多台，远高于2017年的168000台，增幅超过100000台。
According to the 2019 World Robotics Report of the International Federation of Robotics, sales of service robots rose 32% to $9.2 billion in 2019, 61% to more than 271,000 in 2018, up more than 100,000 from 168,000 in 2017.
服务机器人种类多，应用领域广，这导致服务类机器人在所有机器人销售份额中所占的比重，正在不断上升，目前已经接近整个市场的三分之一。
The diversity of service robots and their wide range of applications has led to a growing share of service robots in all robotic sales, which are now close to one-third of the market.
在服务机器人领域，物流系统服务机器人销售量增幅最明显，2018年出售了近111000个，比2017年的69000个多出60％，其他如检查和维护机器人、医疗机器人也都有相当亮眼的成绩。
In the area of service robotics, logistics systems services saw the most significant increase in sales, with nearly 11,000 robots sold in 2018, 60 per cent more than the 69,000 in 2017, while other robots, such as inspection and maintenance, and medical robots, also had impressive results.
中国机器人市场需求来源 / IFR、中国电子学会但多位采访对象都表示，在目前通信、技术等各项条件的制约下，即便有疫情的催化作用，无人配送等服务类机器人要到成熟阶段，依然需要时间和客观条件的进一步发展，比如5G的普遍应用、技术的更加完善等。
However, many interviewees from China Robotics Market Demand Source / IFR and China Electronic Society said that under the current conditions of communication and technology, even with the catalytic effect of the epidemic, service-like robots such as unmanned delivery will need further development of time and objective conditions, such as the universal application of 5G and the improvement of technology.
“2020年的疫情对于人工智能行业，就如同非典加速了中国的电子商务发展一样”，姚锦程说，“人工智能算法、导航SLAM算法及5G通信等这些技术积累，最终需要被整合成一个应用，只不过需要合适的契机和场景的爆发点。
"The 2020 epidemic will be like SARS accelerating e-commerce in China," Yao said. "Artificial intelligence algorithms, navigation SLAM algorithms and 5G communications are technologies that eventually need to be integrated into one application, but only at the right point of opportunity and scenario."
我认为，服务机器人行业今年肯定会爆发。
I think the service robotics industry is sure to explode this year.
”石东华认为，具有互联网和2C属性的服务机器人市场空间有望相当于手机市场+汽车市场+第三代互联网市场，是继第一代PC互联网、第二代移动互联网之后的第三代机器人互联网。
Mr Shi believes that the market for service robots with Internet and 2C attributes is on track to match the mobile market + car market + 3G internet market and is the third generation of robotic Internet after the first generation of PC Internet and the second generation of mobile Internet.
从中国的人口结构来看，出生率在慢慢下降，而现在的青少年已经在被各类人工智能产品所包围，“留给我们的时间最多只有20年，北京可能只有10年，我们必须推动机器人行业，让它们在各行各业中发挥作用，这也是我们应该担负的责任”，栾学锋说。
According to China's demographic structure, the birth rate is slowly declining, but teenagers are already surrounded by artificial intelligence products. "We have only 20 years to spare, and Beijing may only have 10 years.
