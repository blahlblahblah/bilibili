澎湃新闻综合报道2月18日下午，广东省举行新闻发布会，通报疫情防控相关情况。
On Feb. 18 afternoon, a press conference was held in Guangdong province to report on the prevention and control of the epidemic.
磷酸氯喹还算不上特效药，但是对治疗有帮助国家卫健委高级别专家组组长、中国工程院院士钟南山介绍，磷酸氯喹够不上特效药，但是非常值得探讨的药。
chloroquine phosphate is not exactly a specific drug, but it is a drug worth exploring, said Zhong Nan-shan, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and head of the high-level group of experts on treatment.
面临着全世界没看过的东西，实践先于科研，摸着石头过河。
Facing the world has not seen things, practice before scientific research, feel the stone across the river.
磷酸氯喹的研究不是中国最早做的，比利时等国家已经做过，氯喹对冠状病毒有效。
Chloroquine phosphate was not first studied in China. Belgium and other countries have already done it. chloroquine is effective against coronavirus.
但真正用在人体，是在这次疫情中。
But it really works in the human body, it's in this epidemic.
我们广东差不多和北京同时开展研究。
We in Guangdong conduct research almost simultaneously with Beijing.
在开放研究中，发现它能使患者15天左右转阴性。
In an open study, it was found to cause patients to turn negative in about 15 days.
现在不可能做严格的临床试验，但和其他药物对比，发热症状和病毒消失时间早一天。
It is not possible to conduct rigorous clinical trials, but fever symptoms and viruses disappear a day earlier than with other drugs.
另外，目前看它的副作用不算很多。
Besides, its side effects are not very great at present.
比如患者有消化道症状如腹泻、耳鸣等，可以早点缓解。
For example, patients with digestive symptoms such as diarrhea, tinnitus and so on, can be alleviated early.
总的来说，特效药够不上，但有没有帮助呢？现有来看，是有帮助的。
In general, specific drugs are not enough, but does it help? The existing view, is helpful.
武汉还没有停止人传人中国工程院院士钟南山介绍，目前武汉依然是关键，八成病人在武汉，九成死亡病例在武汉，武汉现在看来还并没有停止人传人。
Wuhan has not stopped human-to-human transmission Academician Zhong Nan Shan, said Wuhan is still the key, 80% of patients in Wuhan, 90% of the deaths in Wuhan, Wuhan now seems to have not stopped.
现在需要密切解决两个问题，一是正常人和病人分开，二是新冠肺炎病人和流感病人分开。
There are two issues that need to be addressed closely, one is the separation of normal people from patients and the other is the separation of patients with new crown pneumonia and influenza.
不能老是混在一起，武汉用了很大人力财力，这个问题仍然不能解决。
Wuhan can not always mix together, Wuhan has spent a lot of manpower and financial resources, this problem can not be solved.
新冠肺炎血浆疗法安全有效，广东也计划用它治疗重症钟南山院士18日表示，血浆疗法是一些新冠肺炎康复病人贡献出血液后制备成血浆进行治疗的方法。
New crown pneumonia plasma treatment is safe and effective, Guangdong also plans to use it to treat severe Academician Zhong Nan Shan 18, plasma treatment is a number of patients after the new crown pneumonia rehabilitation contributed blood into plasma treatment methods.
在武汉生物治理研究所，目前已经进行了10例治疗，其中6例有病毒血症，在使用血浆治疗后，两三天后病毒血症消失，病人临床情况有所改善。
At Wuhan Institute of Biological Governance, 10 cases have been treated, 6 of which have viremia. After two or three days of plasma treatment, viremia disappeared and the patient's clinical condition improved.
钟南山认为，这种疗法很有希望，有效而且安全。
Zhong Nan Shan believes that this treatment is very promising, effective and safe.
他同时透露，下一步广东也计划采用血浆疗法对重症病人进行治疗。
The next step, he said, is that Guangdong also plans to use plasma therapy to treat patients with severe illnesses.
保持下水道通畅极为重要钟南山介绍，大概85%的重症病人如果有良好的临床医疗生命支撑与营养保障，症状都是能够明显改善的，其余15%的危重症患者，需要更进一步的治疗。
Keeping sewers open is extremely important, Zhong Nan-shan said that about 85 percent of patients with severe illnesses could improve their symptoms if they had good clinical life support and nutritional security. The remaining 15 percent of critically ill patients need further treatment.
“有些重症患者经过七八天治疗，体内病毒含量大大减少。
"Some patients with severe illness have significantly reduced viral load after seven or eight days of treatment.
”“目前重症患者出院的还不多，但重症患者经过良好治疗，从ICU转入普通病房的病例很多。
"There are not many cases of serious patients being discharged from hospitals, but the number of patients who have undergone good treatment and are referred from ICU to the general ward is very high.
总体而言，现阶段重症患者的治疗效果是不错的。
Overall, the current treatment of severe patients is good.
”钟南山说。
"said Zhong Nan Shan.
另外，钟南山表示，在重症患者的成功救治率方面，武汉地区和武汉以外的地区差别不大。
In addition, Zhong Nan Shan said, in the severe cases of the success rate of treatment, Wuhan and areas outside Wuhan is not much difference.
“在武汉，我们跟踪重症患者的呼吸道病毒载量后发现，如果给他很好的生命支持，病毒载量随之下降，即时是没有用药，病毒载量也会有所下降。
"In Wuhan, we tracked the viral load in critically ill patients and found that if we gave him good life support, the viral load would drop, even without medication, and the viral load would drop.
”此外，钟南山表示，如何有效预防院内感染是非常重要的问题。
In addition, Zhong Nan-shan said effective prevention of nosocomial infections is a very important issue.
“全国医护人员感染数据是1700多名，其中不少发生在武汉的医院。
"There are more than 1,700 medical workers infected nationwide, many of them in Wuhan hospitals.
在疫情防控的早期，医院成为了交叉感染的主要场所之一。
In the early stage of epidemic prevention and control, hospitals have become one of the main sites of cross-infection.
”他提醒，保持下水道的通畅极为重要。
Keeping sewers open was vital, he cautioned.
“此前有团队已经在粪便里发现新冠病毒。
"One team has already found the new crown virus in the feces.
新冠病毒并不一定通过消化道传播感染，而是因为下水道中污染物干了，又通过空气、气溶胶传播，人们吸入造成感染。
The new crown virus does not necessarily transmit infection through the digestive tract, but through the air and aerosols that drain the sewer and infect people.
”他说，这是最合理的解释。
That, he says, is the most plausible explanation.
