即使不是新冠肺炎确诊患者，疫情也如影随形地影响着罕见病家庭。

疫情当下，封城封路，交通不便，便宜药买不到、昂贵药吃不消。

近日，南方都市报接到开心妈妈余鸢的求助，她称孩子的药快吃完了，以往买的药都是代购从土耳其捎回来的，但最近代购也买不到药了，“从去年11月开始药品就变得很紧张”。
Recently, the Southern Metropolis Daily received help from a happy mother, Yu Kite. She said the children were running out of medicine. Drugs bought in the past had been bought from Turkey, but they had not been available recently.
北京蝴蝶结结节性硬化症罕见病关爱中心告诉南都记者，结节性硬化症患者的救命药氨己烯酸片（又称“喜保宁”）在境内既无生产厂家也无商家销售，罕见病患者家庭大多只能通过找人代购的形式买药，“和电影《我不是药神》情节差不多”。
The Center for Care of Rare Diseases of Beijing Butterfly knot Tuberous Sclerosis told reporters in Nantou that life-saving tablets for tuberous sclerosis, also known as siloxacin, are neither manufactured nor marketed in China.
南都记者从寇德罕见病中心（CORD）了解到，该中心统计目前超过300名罕见病患者正面临缺药困境。
Southern journalists learn from CORD that the center counts more than 300 rare patients who are facing a drug shortage.
虽然香港也有喜保宁出售，但港版喜保宁价格较贵，疫情也影响了发货，“光呼吁不奏效，希望更多人看到患者家庭的困难。
While the Hong Kong version of the company is for sale, the Hong Kong version is more expensive, and the outbreak is affecting shipments. "The appeal is not working, I hope more people will see the difficulties of their families.
”救命的药贵且难买2月21日，从湖北荆州市区驱车数十公里，经过防疫检查点设置的重重关卡和多次测温，南都记者抵达位于公安县闸口镇的开心的家。

2012年，开心出生在深圳，11个月大时，被确诊为患有结节性硬化症。

8岁的开心生活尚不能自理，不懂表达，不会与人沟通，需要24小时看护。
8-year-old happy life has not been able to care for themselves, do not know how to express, do not communicate, need 24-hour care.

她曾在深圳的连锁快餐店打工，迫于生活压力，去年带着开心回到湖北荆州的农村老家。
She worked in a chain of fast food restaurants in Shenzhen and was forced to return to her rural home in Jingzhou, Hubei Province, last year under pressure of life.
在开心的房间，余鸢将孩子日常吃的药一字排开。
In the happy room, the kite line up the medicine the child eats.
“喜保宁、德巴金、雷帕霉素，这些都要吃。
'Cibaoning, Debakin, Rapamycin, all of which are to be eaten.
主要还是喜保宁，治婴儿痉挛的。
Mainly like Boryeong, the treatment of infantile spasm.
”余鸢说，“如果能买到土耳其的喜保宁，现在价格应该也在500元一盒了。
"If you can buy kibooni from Turkey, the price should be 500 yuan a box now," Yu said.
”喜保宁也有港版，不易买到，1200元到1500元的价格，对开心一家来说，也吃不消。
"Xi BaoNing also has the Hong Kong version, not easy to buy, 1200 yuan to 1500 yuan prices, happy family, also can not bear.
开心的日常用药。

Liu Jinzhu, son of Liu Jinzhu, director of the Beijing Butterfly knot tuberous sclerosis Care Center, is also a tuberous sclerosis sufferer.
他告诉南都记者，由于境内没有厂家生产喜保宁，也无正规渠道销售该药，患者家庭只能通过代购买药，“游走在法律的边缘，跟电影《我不是药神》的情节差不多”。
He told Nandu that since there were no manufacturers in China to produce and sell the drug through regular channels, the families of patients could only buy the drug on behalf of the law, "wandering on the edge of the law, like the movie" I'm not a drug god. "
刘金柱表示，幸好境内德巴金和雷帕霉素不缺，“雷帕霉素与华北制药有合作，之前特定生产了一批。
Luckily, Mr Liu said, Depakin and rapamycin were not in short supply. "Rapamycin worked with NorthChina Pharmaceuticals, which had previously produced a specific batch.
”至少300同类罕见病患者缺药治疗罕见病的急需药品难找是常态，有人亦称其为“孤儿药”。
It is not uncommon for at least 300 patients of the same group to lack medicines to treat rare diseases, often referred to as "orphan drugs."
罕见病患病人群少，市场需求少，研发成本高，企业投入产出不对等因素造成这种状况长期存在。
Rare diseases and diseases of the population, low market demand, high research and development costs, enterprises input-output imbalance factors caused this situation for a long time.
CORD工作人员表示，最近他们统计到超过300名结节性硬化症患者面临缺药困境，新冠肺炎疫情发生后，需求愈发紧迫。
CORD staff say they recently counted more than 300 tuberous sclerosis sufferers facing a drug shortage, and the need for new crown pneumonia has become more pressing.
刘金柱告诉南都记者，对于湖北地区的患者来说，缺药问题颇为严重，因为疫情原因，购药、收取药品快递很不方便。
Liu Jinzhu told Nandu reporter that, for patients in Hubei region, the lack of drugs is quite serious, because of the epidemic, the purchase of drugs, express delivery of drugs is very inconvenient.
CORD工作人员则表示，尽管湖北多地封城，但CORD在联系武汉相关的物流机构、志愿者团队和网络售药平台，力求解决患者寻药的最后一关。
CORD staff said that despite the closure of many places in Hubei Province, but CORD in Wuhan related logistics organizations, volunteer teams and network sales platform, to solve patients to find the last level.
爸爸之所以给开心取这个名字，是希望她一辈子开开心心。

往年生日，家人给她买了好吃的蛋糕，今年由于疫情，村封了，蛋糕也买不到了。

“她选择了我，我就尽全力”南都记者了解到，世界上每 6000 个新生婴儿中就有一个结节性硬化症患儿，地球上每隔20分钟就有一个结节性硬化症患者降生，中国的结节性硬化症约有10万人，全世界有100万以上的结节性硬化症患者。

On 11 May 2018, five departments, including the National Board of Health Care, jointly developed the "First Rare Disease Catalogue," which includes tuberous sclerosis.
刘金柱表示，这意味着国家承认了该病，“希望监管机构在制定政策时有所倾斜。
Mr Liu said this meant the state recognized the disease and "wanted regulators to be biased in their policy-making."
”开心蛮依赖妈妈，虽然不能正常说话，但会通过摸头的方式向妈妈表达爱意。
"Happy depends on her mother, who can't talk normally but can show her love by touching her head.
余鸢说，现在回老家了，唯一的想法就是好好照顾女儿。
Now that the kite was back home, the only idea was to take good care of her.
“以前每隔三个月会去医院复查一次，每隔半年对头部和腹部做一次核磁共振，最近两年都没去复查，本来计划春节期间带她去做一次全面复查，眼看疫情来了也出不去。
"I used to go to the hospital every three months and have an MRI every six months on her head and abdomen, but I haven't reviewed it in the last two years.
”妈妈帮开心换睡衣。
"My mother helped to change into pajamas.
开心会通过摸头的方式表达喜欢，但也让小朋友觉得古怪而不愿跟她玩。
Happy through the way to express like, but also let the children feel strange and unwilling to play with her.
余鸢说，“孩子一个月的药费得三四千块钱，只要用药能有保障，哪怕她的情况再差，我都能接受，因为既然她选择了我，我就尽全力照顾好她。
"I will pay three or four thousand a month for the child's medicine. I will take care of her even if her condition is worse," she said.
