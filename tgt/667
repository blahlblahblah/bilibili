这个春节有点囧口述/陈老板（温州一餐厅负责人）昨晚我一夜没睡，今天早上就出发了，我想回大温州。
This Spring Festival is a bit harsh Oral / Chen Boss (a restaurant manager in Wenzhou) I stayed up all night last night and started off this morning. I want to go back to Wenzhou.
但是开了一整天，晚上六点了，我还在乐清北高速口吃旺旺雪饼。
But the driving all day, 6: 00 pm, I was still in Yueqing North High Speed stammer Wangwang snow cake.
这就是我的元宵节晚饭了。
This is my Lantern Festival dinner.
加上今天，我已经在车上住了15天，啃方便面啃到口腔溃疡。
Plus today, I've been living in the car for 15 days, nibbling on instant noodles and chewing on oral ulcers.
▲我在江西三清山服务区我是安徽人，在温州做生意，身份证上住址是四川的，年前我去江西上饶看朋友。
I am in Jiangxi Sanqing Mountain Service District I am Anhui, Wenzhou business, ID card address is Sichuan, I went to Jiangxi to see friends.
然后，因为各地封路，我就哪里也去不了了。
And then, because the roads are blocked everywhere, I can't go anywhere.
我的衣服全都脏了、湿了，车子油只剩两格。
My clothes were all dirty and wet, and the car had only two compartments left.
别的地方我不想去了，只想回我大温州。
I don't want to go anywhere else. I just want to go back to Wenzhou.
但我折腾了一整天，现在（2月8日晚）还在路上，仍然回不了家……01突然我就火了，但我只想回家滞留三清山服务区的这几天，我其实一直在想办法。
But I toiled all day, and now (on the night of Feb. 8) I'm still on my way, and I can't go home... 01 Suddenly I got angry, but I just wanted to go home and stay in the Sanqing Mountain service area.
我每天发朋友圈刷屏，各个群里跟唐僧一样说我的遭遇，自己都嫌自己烦。
Every day I brush the screen of friends, groups like the Tang Priest to say what happened to me, they are tired of their own.
昨天我把自己的经历讲给一个朋友听，她写到了网上，看看能不能获得帮助。
Yesterday I told a friend about my experience and she wrote it on the Internet to see if she could get any help.
晚上十点多到现在，我的手机消息就一直没停过。
Ten o'clock in the evening more than now, my mobile phone messages have not stopped.
员工说：“经理，你上热门了。
"You're hot, manager," said the employee.
”网络的力量真是太大了。
"The power of the Internet is enormous.
我明明戴着口罩，见过我的都认出了是我，有的还说我口罩戴反了。
I was clearly wearing a mask, and everyone who saw me recognized me, and some said that my mask was on the wrong side.
过去在温州，我们那个镇上的餐饮圈里，我也算有点名气，但是这次是最出名的。
I used to be a bit of a celebrity in Wenzhou, our town's dining circle, but this time it was the most famous.
我没想过要这么出名啊，而且，为什么我还是回不了温州啊，谁来帮帮我？早上我七点多就醒了。
I didn't want to be so famous. Besides, why can't I go back to Wenzhou? Who will help me? I woke up at seven in the morning.
其实是一晚上基本没睡。
It's been a whole night without much sleep.
网友们有的同情我，有的骂我作。
Some netizens sympathize with me, others scold me for it.
我想了一晚上，我就是一本书啊。
I've been thinking all night. I'm a book.
起起伏伏，这些我经历得太多。
I've been through a lot of it.
我被车撞了两次，被水淹过两次，因为感染登革热被隔离过……你们放心，我会重新站起来！其实啊，说我是老板，其实也只是个小小生意人，我在温州现在还是租的房子，一个月1500元。
I was hit twice by a car, flooded twice because I was quarantined with dengue... You can rest assured that I will get back on my feet.
我说自己没钱加油真不是骗人，今年生意亏得太厉害。
I said that I do not have the money to refuel is not deceitful, this year's business loss is too bad.
▲出发后，我先到了青田服务站早上我把车里收拾了一下，就准备出发。
After I left, I got to the Qingtian service station first. I packed my car in the morning and got ready to leave.
我是个爱干净的人，这些天都在吃喝都在车里，太邋遢了。
I'm a very clean person. I've been eating and drinking in the car these days. I'm too messy.
昨天朋友们转给我一些钱，加油是够了，谢谢大家。
Yesterday my friends transferred me some money, refueling is enough, thank you.
九点多，我出发了。
It's past nine. I'm leaving.
再见，三清山服务区，再见，老大哥。
Goodbye, Sanqing Mountain Service Area. Bye, Big Brother.
02温州高速口这么多，哪一个会为我打开？温州有好几个高速路口，我打算先去七里港高速路口，不行再去乐清出入口，再温州东、温州南……喝一罐咖啡，一个个试起来，开始！往温州方向，一路上除了几辆货车，小汽车只有我一辆。
Wenzhou so many high-speed mouth, which will open for me? Wenzhou there are several high-speed intersection, I intend to go to the seven-mile intersection, I can not go to Yueqing entrance, Wenzhou East, Wenzhou South... Drink a can of coffee, try one by one, start!
“这是什么地方，依然是如此的荒凉，那无尽的旅程，如此漫长，我是永远向着远方独行的浪子。
"What place is this, is still so desolate, that endless journey, so long, I am the prodigal son that forever walks to the distance alone.
”太冷清了，我放起歌，刚好有首许巍的，听得有点想哭。
"Too cold, I put up the song, just a Xu Wei, listening to a little want to cry.
我在青田服务区稍微休息了一下，这边也没有什么店开着了。
I had a little rest in the Tsing Tin service area and there were no stores open here.
我有点低血糖，头有点晕，浑身发抖。
I'm a little hypoglycemic, I'm dizzy, I'm shaking.
我又喝了点咖啡。
I had some more coffee.
朋友给我看了一条消息，整个人又不好了。
My friend showed me a piece of news, the whole person is not good.
那条消息上说，三返人员千万不要带着侥幸心理3月1日之前回温州，回来的话要自费隔离，一天800。
According to the news, returnees should never return to Wenzhou with a stroke of luck before March 1. If they come back, they should be isolated at their own expense, 800 a day.
我还是又上路了，万一还是不要钱，或者只要一点钱呢？▲我又到了七里港15:07分，我到了温州七里港高速路口。
I still on the road, in case there is no money, or as long as a little money? I reached the Seven Mile Harbor at 15: 07, I arrived at Wenzhou Port Expressway junction.
这里完全被路障封死。
This place is completely blocked by a roadblock.
我把车靠边停好，去找工作人员。
I pulled over and looked for the staff.
工作人员说，去乐清北试试吧，这里肯定过不去的。
Staff said, to the north of Yueqing try it, there must be no passing.
镇上一个领导打电话给我，叫我不要急，再去试试，她也想办法帮我打听打听。
One of the town leaders called and told me not to hurry and try again, and she tried to make inquiries for me.
15:55分，我到了乐清北高速路口，果然，又已经封死了。
At 1555 hours I reached the Yueqing North Expressway junction and, as expected, it was sealed again.
真的累了，我跑去问执勤的特警，难道没有办法了吗？他说，必须要有通行证，让社区或者公司来办。
Really tired, I ran to ask the special police on duty, there is no way? He said, must have a pass, let the community or the company to do it.
我打110，打12345，打各种朋友的电话。
I call 110, I call 12345, I call friends of all kinds.
打得我头更晕了。
It made my head dizzy.
得到的结果是，这种通行证是很难办出来的，一般只有防疫期间的一些特种行业才能办得出，我们餐饮业不属于这类。
As a result, such permits are difficult to obtain, generally only during the epidemic prevention of some special industries can do, we do not belong to the catering industry.
我在温州也没有房子，租房所在的村领导我也不认识。
I also do not have a house in Wenzhou, rental housing the village leader I do not know.
现在，我把车还是停在温州北高速入口。
Now, I'm parked at the north entrance to Wenzhou.
天又黑了，又是一天要过去了。
It was dark again, and the day was drawing to a close.
▲吃了几块旺旺雪饼车里还有几块旺旺雪饼，我吃了它，再想想办法。
I ate a few Wangwang Snowcake cars and a few Wangwang snowflakes, and I ate it and tried to think about it.
可能今天还要在车里，那明天呢？03我终于下高速，但是……又有朋友说，温州东高速口恢复了。
Maybe in the car today, what about tomorrow? 03 I finally got off the freeway, but... another friend said, Wenzhou East Expressway is back.
我再去试试。
I'll try again.
最差的结果，我还有老大哥。
Worst of all, I have Big Brother.
19:13分，我来到了温州东。
And I came to the east of Wenzhou.
这里真的没有封！▲剩下这一段路了！工作人员把我拦下，我有些激动。
There's really no seal! This is the last leg of the road! The staff stopped me, and I was a little excited.
他们检查我的身份证，给我量体温，我把那份卫生院开的健康证明也拿了出来。
They checked my ID, took my temperature, and I brought out the health certificate from the clinic.
他们什么也没说，我的车子能过去了！闯关成功！但是朋友们又说，乐清已经封城了。
They did not say anything, my car can pass! Break through successfully! But the friends said, Yueqing has closed the city.
我进得了温州，未必能进乐清。
I can enter Wenzhou, may not be able to enter Yueqing.
果不其然，我下高速，到瓯越大桥入桥口被拦住了，交警看了我身份证，劝我返回，我说我实在动不了了，我在高速和车上已经待15天了，我心跳都加速了。
Sure enough, I got off the highway and was stopped at the entrance to the Ouyue Bridge. The traffic police showed me my identity card and advised me to return.
我给交警看了江西上饶医院开的证明，交警放我通行了。
I showed the traffic police the certificate issued by the Shangyao Hospital in Jiangxi Province. The traffic police let me pass.
我过了大桥，又一个卡口，我再次被拦。
I got across the bridge, another jam, and I was stopped again.
这里的交警依然劝我返回，我说我真的走不了了，我回哪里呀，江西也不是我的家，我只是去看个朋友，四川那么远。
Here traffic police still advise me to return, I said I really can not go, I go back where, Jiangxi is not my home, I just go to see a friend, Sichuan so far.
我说我现在又累又乏，心跳加速。
I said I was tired and tired and my heart beat fast.
有位交警听完我的讲述，打了一通电话，然后走过来，让我先坐一会儿，他给我泡了一碗方便面，另外一位交警给我拿了橘子。
A traffic policeman listened to my story, made a phone call, and then came over and asked me to sit down for a while. He made me a bowl of instant noodles and another policeman brought me oranges.
吃了方便面和橘子，我一下精神了很多。
Having eaten instant noodles and oranges, I had a lot of energy.
他们说可以让酒店股东来接我，可是我酒店的股东不在温州。
They said they could let the hotel shareholders pick me up, but my hotel shareholders were not in Wenzhou.
交警又去打电话了，然后走过来对我说：“今晚，还要辛苦你一下，明天我们会想办法让你回乐清。
The traffic police called again and came up to me and said, "Tonight we'll have to work on you. Tomorrow we'll figure out a way to get you back to Yuqing.
”现在，我的心应该可以放下了吧！？谢谢所有一直关心我的朋友们！记录平凡而普通的人生你“在看”我吗？点一下让我知道。
"Now, my heart should be able to put it down!? Thanks to all the friends who have always cared about me! Record ordinary and ordinary life Are you" looking at "me? Click to let me know.
