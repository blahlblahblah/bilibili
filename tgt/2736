“已经没有诚信可言了，只认钱”随着疫情发展，制造企业争先恐后地加入了口罩生产的队伍中。
"There is no longer any credibility, only acknowledge money" With the spread of the epidemic, manufacturers rushed to join the team of mask production.
但这个过程很难说一帆风顺。
But the process is hardly plain sailing.
许多企业在转产之前，都先入为主地低估了口罩生产的技术含量。
Many companies are pre-empting the technical content of mask production before switching production.
随着流程推进，许多问题逐渐暴露了出来。
As the process progressed, a number of issues emerged.
人们这才发现，小小一个口罩，牵扯到诸多零部件、原材料、生产设备和资质标准，全部跑通，并不比生产别的产品容易多少。
It turned out that a small mask, which involved many parts, raw materials, production equipment and qualification standards, was no easier than making other products.
时间紧，需求大。
Time is short and demand is high.
一窝蜂涌入，摸着石头过河。
Crowds of bees swarmed across the river.
碰到麻烦，几乎是必然的。
Trouble is almost certain.
纠纷2月29日晚间，许多人和车团团围住了赢合科技的厂区大门。
On the night of Feb. 29, many people and cars crowded around the gate of the winning tech factory.
来者都是赢合科技的客户。
The visitors are all customers of Winning Technologies.
其中绝大多数都是第一次涉足这个产业。
The vast majority of them are in the industry for the first time.
他们给了订金，将厂房做了洁净处理，储存了熔喷布，只等口罩机一到便开工。
They gave the deposit, cleaned the plant, stored the spray cloth, and waited until the mask machine arrived.
然而临近交付期，供应商却一拖再拖，客户们的耐心很快被消磨殆尽。
However, as the delivery period approached, the suppliers procrastinated and the patience of the customers was quickly eroded.
心急如焚之下，便团团围住了赢合科技的厂区，试图“抢”出一些设备来。
Distraught, the company surrounded the winning technology plant, trying to "grab" some equipment.
根据《中国企业家杂志》早先报道，赢合科技原本的主营业务是锂电池制造装备。
According to an earlier report in the Chinese Journal of Entrepreneurs, Win-tech's original main business was lithium-ion battery manufacturing equipment.
自2月4日媒体曝出赢合科技将紧急生产口罩机后，公司每天都能接到一二百台订单，截至2月16日，订单数量已近1600台。
The company has received one to two hundred orders a day since Feb. 4, when Winning Technologies announced it would produce an emergency mask maker. As of Feb. 16, orders were close to 1,600.
而根据业内人士的透露，二月底，赢合科技接下的订单数量已经达到约两千台。
At the end of February, according to people in the industry, the number of orders won by Wincom reached about 2,000.
然而实际产出量却远远没达到这个数字。
Actual output, however, fell far short of that figure.
2月29日夜晚的赢合科技厂区门口。

图源自网络余南是赢合科技的客户之一。
Figure from the network Yu Nan is one of the winning technology customers.
2月，他以每台55万元的价格订购了8台口罩机生产线。
In February, he ordered eight production lines for masks at $550,000 each.
但至今也没有拿到一台。
To date, none has been made available.
“这个行业已经没有诚信可言了，只认钱。
"There is no longer any honesty in this business, only money.
”在接受中国新闻周刊采访时，余南显得有些气愤，“加几万，马上就撕毁合同，卖给别家。
In an interview with China News Weekly, Yu looked a little angry. "Add tens of thousands and immediately tear up the contract and sell it to someone else.
”迟迟无法交货的原因很复杂，涉及技术储备、上游产业链供应等多方面原因。
The reasons for the delay in delivery are complex, involving multiple factors such as technical reserves and supply of upstream industrial chains.
赢合科技也并不是孤例。
Winning technology is not alone.
余南的公司也另外向诺峰光电订购了四台口罩机，对方承诺会在3月4日之前交付，但同样直到现在也没消息。
Yu Nan's company also ordered four additional mask machines from Novo Photovoltaic, which promised to be delivered by March 4, but so far no news has been received.
根据深圳医协提供的一组数据显示：市面上主流的口罩机，一小时的节拍是6000只，旧机型一小时的节拍是3600-4000只。
According to a set of data provided by the Shenzhen Medical Association, the prevailing mask machine has 6,000 beats per hour on the market and 3,600 to 4,000 beats per hour on the old models.
但很多转产的厂商远远达不到这个要求。
But many manufacturers who convert fall far short of this requirement.
余南告诉中国新闻周刊，自己曾经去深圳多个口罩机生产厂家实地考察过。
Yu told China News Weekly that he had been to Shenzhen several mask machine manufacturers on the spot.
在他看来，能够流畅运作的机器并不多，几乎都有大大小小的问题。
In his view, there were not many machines that could operate smoothly, almost all with problems large and small.
“不是这里卡住就是那里卡住，基本就没有跑顺的，一小时能出几百个就不错了。
"Either it gets stuck here or it gets stuck, it's basically not running smoothly, and it's good to be able to give hundreds of them in an hour.
”余南告诉中国新闻周刊，“我是做技术出身的，当时还在跟他们一起琢磨。
"I came from a technical background and was still thinking about it with them," Yu told China News Weekly.
要是完全没有技术底子的老板把这种设备买回去，会成什么样子？”但疫情之下，人人都变得急躁了起来。
What would happen if a completely unskilled boss bought the equipment back? "But with the outbreak, everyone became impatient.
余南也坦言，这个时候，有能力交付整机的供应商，已经能称得上“良心企业”。
Yu also admitted that this time, the ability to deliver the entire machine supplier, can be said to be "conscience enterprises."
有些厂家交付一堆零件，叫客户回去自己组装；更过分的，甚至只在网上下载了图纸，就对外宣称自己有能力制造口罩机，开始收订金了。
Some manufacturers deliver a pile of parts and tell customers to go home and assemble their own; some go so far as to download drawings online and claim to have the ability to make masks and start charging down.
除了硬件上的限制，口罩机的安装、调试和日常维护所需的人手也相当缺乏。
In addition to the hardware constraints, the mask machine installation, debugging and daily maintenance of the staff is also quite inadequate.
深圳医疗器械行业协会（以下简称“深圳医协”）法规经理胡辉向中国新闻周刊解释，疫情发生之前，以深圳市为例，仅有深中海医疗用品（深圳）有限公司、英诺利科技（深圳）有限公司、深圳市宇冠医疗器械有限公司、深圳市腾他抗菌纺织品有限公司四家生产企业持有有效的医用口罩产品注册证。
Before the outbreak, only four manufacturers, Shenzhen Zhonghai Medical Supplies (Shenzhen) Co. Ltd, Innoli Technology (Shenzhen) Ltd, Shenzhen Yuguan Medical Device Co. Ltd. and Shenzhen Tengta Antibacterial Textile Co. Ltd, held valid medical mask product registration certificates.
其中宇冠、腾他未涉足口罩生产；英诺利主要针对海外市场；仅深中海有在国内生产销售口罩的经验。
Among them, Yu Guan, Teng did not dabble in mask production; Innolly mainly for overseas markets; only Shenzhen China Sea has experience in the domestic production and sale of masks.
因此，该行业原本积累的人员储备并不算充足。
As a result, the industry's already accumulated staff reserves are inadequate.
尽管民用口罩与医用口罩的产品技术和工艺相似，大部分人员可共用；政府部门也协调了一部分原有生产口罩的企业派员到临时跨行的企业做技术指导。
Although the products of the mask are similar in technology and technology, most people can share them. Government departments have also coordinated the deployment of some of the former mask manufacturers to temporary enterprises to provide technical guidance.
但总体而言，技术人员不足的矛盾仍然突出。
Overall, however, the shortage of skilled personnel remains acute.
2020年3月4日，鲁华集团山东康力医疗器械科技有限公司的工人在严格消毒环境下检验生产的医护用品质量。
On March 4, 2020, workers from Shandong Kangli Medical Device Technology Co. Ltd., Luhua Group, tested the quality of medical supplies produced under strict disinfection conditions.
中新社发 吉喆 摄胡辉向中国新闻周刊解释，很多企业主入局太急，以为口罩生产技术简单，就是“三层布压在一块”。
Zhe Jie, the Chinese news agency, explained to China News Weekly that many business owners were too quick to think that the mask-making technology was simple: "three layers of cloth pressed together."
最后的结果却是，东西虽然能做出来，但却根本无法满足量产的要求。
In the end, though things can be done, they simply can't meet the demands of mass production.
“打个比方，这个有点像飞利浦的剃须刀。
"This is sort of like a Philips razor, to put it another way.
看着是很简单的东西，但很多细节需要积累，外表看不出来，只有实践碰上了才会明白。
Looks is very simple thing, but many details need to accumulate, the appearance does not see clearly, only then meets the practice can understand.
”胡辉说。
"said Hu.
忠告根据公众号“雪球炒全球”的估算，将卫生人员、学生和退休参保人员分别乘以系数，得到的全国每日口罩估计需求量高达4.232亿只。
Admonish, multiply health workers, students and retirees by a factor of 423.2 million, according to a public estimate of Snowball Worldwide.
而据华创证券分析，中国二三产就业人口约5.3亿人，假设每人每天一只，全部复工后，一天需要消耗口罩量更是高达5.3亿只。
According to Huacheng Securities, China's two or three-year-old employed population of about 530 million people, assuming one per person per day, will need to consume 530 million masks a day once they return to work.
在需求的刺激下，大量资本及企业涌入，试图分得一杯羹。
Stimulated by demand, large amounts of capital and companies poured in, trying to grab a slice of the pie.
理想是丰满的：一台口罩自动生产线及原材料拿到手后，一天24小时开足马力，至少能产10万只口罩。
Ideal: An automatic mask production line and raw materials are available 24 hours a day at full capacity, producing at least 100,000 masks.
假设每只口罩利润1元人民币，那么最快五天即可回本。
Assuming a profit of RMB1 per mask, return to book within 5 days at the earliest.
再往后，机器开多少天，就能赚多少天。
After that, you can make as many days as you drive the machine.
但现实却很骨感。
But the reality is bone-chilling.
前述赢合科技的现状，便是矛盾的直接体现。
The status quo of win-win technology is the direct embodiment of contradiction.
3月2日，深圳医协发文建议：中小企业应该谨慎入局口罩生产。
March 2, Shenzhen Medical Association issued a letter suggesting that small and medium-sized enterprises should carefully enter the mask production.
文中解释道，部分口罩自动化产线生产商目前面临交货期延长的问题，原因总结下来，主要有五点：1. 部分口罩自动化生厂商疫情前并不生产口罩生产线，属于转产，制造能力有问题；2. 接单量过多，人力不足，订单量远远大于自身人力承受范围；3. 上游零部件的紧缺和延迟交货，较典型的是超声波电焊机、耳带机、金属件等；4. 政府临时加单，导致商业订单延迟交货；5. 加塞现象严重，例如前述余南提到的“谁加钱就给谁”。
Some manufacturers of automatic mask manufacturers do not produce face mask production line before the epidemic. Some manufacturers do not produce face mask production line before the epidemic, which is a problem in manufacturing capacity.
但只是猜测，并没有证据证明。
But it was speculation, not proof.
以上诸多因素，很难说是人力可以扭转的结果。
Many of these factors can hardly be said to be the result of human efforts to reverse them.
尤其是上游零部件供应短缺和政府加单，更是在企业的控制范围之外。
In particular, the upstream supply of spare parts and government orders, is beyond the control of enterprises.
因此，深圳医协副会长蔡翘梧更倾向于从好的方向来理解这次纠纷：“同心抗击疫情，其实大家的本意都是好的，只是有时候难免高估了自己的实力。
Therefore, the Shenzhen Medical Association vice-president Cai Fushu more inclined to understand the dispute from a good direction: "Concerted efforts to combat the epidemic, in fact, everyone's intention is good, but sometimes inevitably overestimate their own strength.
”蔡翘梧认为，供应商违约已经是不争的事实。
Mr Cai believes it is already an indisputable fact that suppliers are defaulting.
指责、堵门，甚至打一架，都解决不了问题，结果只能是双输。
Accusations, blockades, and even a fight do not solve the problem, the result can only be a lose-lose.
“我们并不认同供应商的做法，但是要解决问题，矛盾双方还是应该坐下来沟通，找到一个都能接受的方案。
"We don't agree with the supplier, but to solve the problem, the two sides should sit down and find a solution that is acceptable to all.
”从宏观的角度来看，企业的纷纷转产还是起到了效果。
"From a macro point of view, the conversion of enterprises or played a role.
数据显示，就在前不久的2月24日，全国口罩日产量不过5400万只。
As recently as February 24, the national output of masks was just 54 million, according to the data.
而根据国家发展改革委3月2日宣布的数据，到了2月29日，包括普通口罩、医用口罩、医用N95口罩在内，全国口罩日产能达到1.1亿只，日产量达到1.16亿只，五天翻了一倍。
By February 29, the National Council for Development and Reform (NDRC) had a daily production capacity of 110 million masks, including ordinary masks, medical masks and N95 masks, and doubled production of 116 million masks per day for five days, according to figures released by the National Development and Reform Commission on 2 March.
据深圳医协副秘书长焦仪分析，数字的增加，主要是因为现有熔喷布的使用效率得到提高。
According to the analysis of Shenzhen Medical Association Deputy Secretary-General focal point, the increase in the number is mainly due to the existing use of melting cloth efficiency.
但因为目前并没有熔喷布的有效替代品，所以仅就医用口罩来讲，短期内，数字进一步大量增加的可能性不大。
But since there is no effective alternative to the spray, there is little likelihood of a further significant increase in the number of medical masks alone in the short term.
而投入熔喷布生产所需的资金又太高昂，除了国家队之外，中小企业入局的动力不足。
And the money needed to invest in production is too high, in addition to the national team, small and medium-sized enterprises have insufficient incentive to enter.
但国家队也的确在行动。
But the national team does act.
根据《财经》报道，2月24日，中国石化党组决定，利用自有原料生产优势，建设10条熔喷布生产线。
On February 24, the group decided to build 10 production lines using its own raw materials, Caijing reported.
投资约2亿元。
Invest about $200 million.
全部投产后，每日可生产12吨N95熔喷布，或生产医用平面口罩原料18吨。
After full production, 12 tons of N95 fusible fabric can be produced daily, or 18 tons of raw materials for medical planar masks can be produced.
如果全部用于生产医用平面口罩，每日产量可达1800万只。
If fully used for the production of medical plane masks, up to 18 million daily production.
2020年3月2日，北京燕山石化新建熔喷无纺布生产线项目现场机器轰鸣。
March 2, 2020, Beijing Yanshan petrochemical new melt spray non-woven production line project site machine roar.
近日，中国石化决定投资约2亿元，在北京燕山石化和江苏仪征化纤两家企业抓紧建设熔喷无纺布（即熔喷布）、纺粘布生产线，预计3月上旬投产。
Sinopec recently decided to invest about 200 million yuan in the construction of a melt-sprayed nonwoven fabric, or melt-jet fabric, and a textile production line in two enterprises, Yanshan Petrochemical Company in Beijing and Yizheng Chemical Fiber in Jiangsu Province, expected to begin production in early March.
中新社发 胡庆明 摄考虑到以上种种因素，深圳医协呼吁，中小企业还是应该量力而行，不仅要对自身能力进行全面评估，也要对自身在行业中的发展有所认识和定位。
Taking into account all these factors, the Association calls on small and medium-sized enterprises to act according to their capabilities, not only to make a comprehensive assessment of their own capacity, but also to their own development in the industry and positioning.
不顾自身情况贸然入局口罩生产，很可能面临诸多意想不到的困难，甚至法律风险，导致损失惨重。
Regardless of their own situation rushed into the production of masks, is likely to face many unexpected difficulties, even legal risks, leading to heavy losses.
采访中，胡辉还提到了“告知承诺制”的概念：疫情中，政府精力有限，无法同往常一样一一去审核企业的每项资质，因此便以书面形式将法律法规规定证明的义务或者证明条件一次性告知当事人，由申请人书面进行承诺，已经符合这些条件、标准和要求，同时也愿意承担承诺不实的法律责任，行政机关就不再索要证明，直接予以办理。
In the interview, Hu also referred to the concept of "commitment to inform": the government, limited energy to review every qualification of the enterprise as usual, so a written commitment by the applicant has met these conditions, standards and requirements, and is willing to assume false legal responsibility, the agency will no longer demand proof and directly deal with it.
但倘若企业在签署承诺书后，产品被抽检出不合格，就很可能要面临产品被罚没，甚至货值金额10-20倍的罚款。
However, if the product is found to be unqualified after signing the undertaking, it is likely to face confiscation of the product or even a fine of 10-20 times the value of the goods.
“我们在这一行做的时间久了，其实看状态就能看出来，谁是认认真真在做技术，谁是想浑水摸鱼。
"We've been working in this business for a long time, but we can see who is really doing the right thing and who is trying to muddle through.
”胡辉坦言。
Hu confessed.
截至发稿，余南也没能拿到一台口罩机。
As of the manuscript, Yu Nan also failed to get a mask machine.
他每天的工作，已经从催单变成了和供应商沟通退订金的事宜。
His day-to-day work has changed from a reminder to a matter of communicating with suppliers about refunds.
至于已经花掉的成本，例如厂房洁净和人员培训等，也只能认赔。
Costs already incurred, such as plant cleanliness and staff training, can only be claimed.
所幸熔喷布是以20万人民币一吨的价格购进的，现在市场价已经涨到了35万左右一吨，转手出去，还能回一些本。
Fortunately, the melting pot was bought at 200,000 yuan a ton. Now the market price has risen to about 350,000 yuan a ton.
“赔了就赔了，能怎么办呢？”余南说。
"Compensated to compensate, how can you do?" Yu Nan said.
