意大利现在处于流行的早期阶段也许与武汉在1月初或中旬流行的阶段相似在未来1~2个月内他们的医疗保健系统将面临更大的压力3月7日，在意大利罗马，戴着口罩的行人经过圆形竞技场。
Italy may be in the early stages of fashion similar to Wuhan in early January or mid-January. In the next 1-2 months, their healthcare systems will come under even greater pressure. In Rome, Italy, pedestrians wearing masks passed the arena on March 7.
图/法新意大利把欧洲带进至暗时刻本刊记者/李明子发于2020.3.16总第939期《中国新闻周刊》3月8日清晨，位于意大利北部的伦巴第大区首府米兰上空的乌云遮挡了连日来的阳光，最低气温下降到3.6℃，南部的罗马则开始下雨。
2007-9-25 21: 23 (Xinhua) -- Italy Brings Europe to Dark Hour (Reuters) - A black cloud over Milan, the capital of Italy's northern region of Lombardy, blocks the sun for days as temperatures fall to 3.6 degrees Celsius in northern Italy and rain begins to rain in southern Rome.
低温且潮湿，据说是新冠病毒最适宜传播的环境。
Low temperature and humidity are said to be the best environment for the spread of the new crown virus.
这一天，新冠病毒也开始在意大利全国93座城市蔓延。
On that day, the new crown virus also began to spread throughout Italy in 93 cities.
截至3月9日18时，意大利累计确诊新冠肺炎病例9172例，共治愈724人，死亡463人，是中国境外死亡病例最多的国家。
By 1800 hours on March 9, Italy had confirmed 9,172 cases of new crown pneumonia, cured 724 people and killed 463 people, the highest number of deaths outside China.
与此同时，疫情也开始以意大利为中心向整个欧洲加速扩散。
Meanwhile, the epidemic has begun to spread rapidly across Europe, with Italy at the center.
有人说，欧洲已经成了湖北，而意大利就是“欧洲的武汉”。
Some people say that Europe has become Hubei, and Italy is "the European Wuhan."
意大利总理孔特9日晚间宣布，将从10日开始在全国范围内实行封城。
Italian Prime Minister Conte announced on the night of 9, will be a nationwide ban from the beginning of 10.
所有居民不得随意进出城市，除工作、紧急情况或医疗状况，出入城市须提供自述声明。
All residents are not allowed to enter or leave the city at will, except in cases of work, emergencies or medical conditions.
同时，全国暂停全部体育赛事。
At the same time, all sporting events are suspended.
学校停课时间延长至4月3日。
School hours were extended to 3 April.
俄罗斯RT电视台称这项举措“史无前例”。
RT Russia called the move "unprecedented."
不过，意大利的“封城”与中国的封城并不完全一样。
But Italy's "closure" is not exactly the same as China's.
米兰的樱花已经开放，街头虽然没有往日热闹，仍能看到当地人悠闲地散步、遛狗、喝咖啡，仿佛什么都没发生，继续享受生活。
Milan's cherry blossoms have blossomed, and although the streets are not as busy as they used to be, locals can still be seen strolling, walking dogs and drinking coffee as if nothing had happened and continuing to enjoy life.
“封城后餐馆、酒吧还开着，当地人照去。
"Restaurants and bars are open behind closed doors and locals take photos.
虽然人们不能去其他城市，但可以在本城内部走动。
Although people can't go to other cities, they can move around the city.
”旅居在米兰的《新欧洲侨报》总编辑吴杰说。
"said Wu Jie, editor-in-chief of New European Diaspora in Milan.
“我们所有人都必须为了意大利的利益而放弃一些东西。
"We must all give up something for the good of Italy.
”孔特在讲话中指出，“我们现在必须做此决定，只有我们大家共同努力，适应这些更严格的措施，才能最终做到。
"We have to make this decision now," he said in his speech. "It can only be achieved if we all work together to adapt to these more stringent measures.
” 此前，孔特接受意大利媒体采访时曾说，他自己一直在思考“二战”时期英国首相丘吉尔的话：“这是我们的至暗时刻，我们会做到的。
In an interview with the Italian media, he had said he had been thinking about Churchill, the British prime minister during World War II: "This is our darkest hour, and we will do it.
”病死率创新高据最新数据显示，意大利新冠肺炎患者的死亡率突破5.04％，全球最高，远超中国新冠肺炎的病死率2.3％，也超过了湖北省的病死率2.9％。
The death rate from pneumonia in Italy is above 5.04 percent, the highest in the world and 2.3 percent higher than the death rate from pneumonia in China and 2.9 percent in Hubei province, according to new figures.
面对疫情，意大利政府的动作其实并不算晚。
It is not too late for the Italian government to respond to the epidemic.
它是武汉暴发新冠肺炎以后第一个宣布限制中国航线的国家。
It was the first country to announce restrictions on Chinese routes after the outbreak of new crown pneumonia in Wuhan.
早在1月31日，当意大利首次确诊了两例输入性新冠病例后，总理孔特就宣布国家进入紧急状态。
Prime Minister Conte declared a state of emergency as early as January 31, when two new cases of imported crowns were first diagnosed in Italy.
随后，孔特宣布暂停中意往来的直飞航班。
Conte then suspended direct flights to and from Italy.
然而，根据2018年中意往返的航班信息，约4/5乘客选择了转机航班，而不是直飞。
However, according to the mid-2018 round-trip flight information, about four-fifths of passengers opted for a connecting flight rather than a direct one.
“宣布了紧急状态，就给了政府在非常时期不需经议会批准即可采取临时性紧急手段的合法权力。
"The declaration of the state of emergency gives the Government the legal authority to use temporary emergency measures in times of emergency without the need for parliamentary approval.
”中国社会科学院欧洲研究所副研究员、中国欧洲学会意大利研究分会秘书长孙彦红解释说，这次意大利政府宣布的紧急状态，准确地说应该是“国家卫生紧急状态”。
Yan Hong Sun, associate researcher at the European Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and secretary-general of the Italian Studies Section of the China European Institute, explained that the state of emergency declared by the Italian government should be a "national health emergency."
尽管意大利是中国之外最早采取防疫措施的国家之一，“但是阻止感染的传入为时已晚，遏制措施无法阻止当地的蔓延。
Although Italy was one of the first countries outside China to take preventive measures, "it was too late to stop the spread of the infection.
”香港大学公共卫生学院流行病与生物统计学教授本杰明·考林回复道。
Benjamin Colin, Professor of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of Hong Kong's School of Public Health, replied.
意大利的宁静终于在一个周五晚上被打破。
The peace of Italy was finally shattered on a Friday night.
2月21日，意大利发现了本土的“一号病人”，该男性患者住伦巴第大区的科多尼奥市，被媒体称为“社交达人”。
On February 21, Italy discovered its own "patient number one," who lives in the city of Cordonio, Lombardy, and is known in the media as a "social guru."
2月14日第一次报告家庭医生症状时被确诊为流感，目前这位医生也已被确诊新冠感染。
She was diagnosed with flu when she first reported symptoms of a family doctor on February 14, and is now diagnosed with a new crown infection.
此后，该病人还传染了他怀有身孕的妻子、一名与他一起参加长跑的朋友以及三名在酒吧聚会的朋友。
Since then, the patient has also infected his pregnant wife, a friend who ran with him on a long run and three friends who met at a bar.
政府随即封锁了附近十余个市镇，约5万多居民受到影响。
The Government then sealed off more than a dozen nearby towns, affecting some 50,000 residents.
米兰Sacco医院专家2月28日组分离出新冠病毒，初步认为出现在意大利的新冠“是一个新变异的病毒”。
Experts at Milan's Sacco hospital on Feb. 28 separated the new crown virus and tentatively suggested that the new crown in Italy "is a new variant of the virus."
专家组负责人马西姆·伽利对法新社说，新冠病毒在意大利正式确诊前已不知不觉运行数周，“也许1月中旬就出现在意大利半岛”。
Masim Gali, head of the group, told AFP that the virus had been unknowingly running for weeks before it was officially diagnosed in Italy, "probably in the Italian peninsula in mid-January."
截至目前，意大利并未找到将病毒传播给“一号病人”的“零号病人”。
So far, Italy has not found "patient zero" to spread the virus to "patient number one."
“许多学者认为，当地对一号病人的跟踪并不及时，也没有对早期移民进行追踪，意大利需要针对轻症病例进行广泛的检测。
"Many scholars believe that local tracking of patient number one is not timely, that early migration is not tracked and that Italy needs extensive testing for mild cases.
”美国约翰·霍普金斯大学卫生安全中心资深学者阿梅什·阿达利亚回复《中国新闻周刊》说。
Amesh Adalia, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University's Center for Health and Safety, replied to China News Weekly.
在确诊、隔离之前，一号病人曾在科多尼奥市一家医院停留36个小时，有医护人员抱怨称，在病人被确诊后，医院没有及时发出警告，延迟“长达数小时”，导致医护人员也暴露在风险中。
Prior to the diagnosis and isolation, patient No. 1 had spent 36 hours in a hospital in the city of Cordonio, where medical staff complained of delays of "up to several hours" after the patient was diagnosed, resulting in medical staff being exposed to risks.
意大利检方和警察已经派驻检查组对此进行调查。
Italian prosecutors and police have sent teams to investigate the matter.
“确诊数字增加的同时，治愈数字也在增加，且死亡病例多为老年人，这可能也是当地人早期轻视疫情的原因。
"The increase in the number of diagnoses has been accompanied by an increase in the number of cures, mostly among the elderly, which may have contributed to the early neglect of the epidemic by the local population.
”吴杰说。
"said Wu Jie.
对此，老龄化问题严重的意大利开始敦促“75岁以上的老人，有健康问题的65岁以上老人，减少社交活动”。
Italy, where aging is a serious problem, is urging "older people over 75, those over 65 with health problems, to cut back on social activities."
据意大利国家统计局的数据，该国65岁以上老年人的数量是14岁以下年轻人数量的1.5倍。
According to ISTAT data, the number of persons over 65 in the country is 1.5 times that of young people under the age of 14.
“抵抗新冠病毒很重要的一条是保护易感人群，要抓住重点，把重点保护对象放在60岁或者是65岁以上的老年人，美国也是这么做。
"It is important to protect vulnerable populations from the new crown virus, and to focus on those who are 60 years old or older," he said.
”美国加州大学洛杉矶分校公共卫生学院副院长张作风介绍说，年轻人变成重症的概率较小，轻型居多，有时病症和感冒一样，病死率相对比较低。
Young people are less likely to become seriously ill, with lighter weights and sometimes a lower death rate, like the cold, said Zhang style, vice president of the UCLA School of Public Health.
同时在流行过程中，年轻人生病以后也能产生自身的免疫抗体，提升群体免疫的水平，在流行后期，对疫情会有抑制的作用。
At the same time, in the epidemic, young people can produce their own immune antibody, improve the level of community immunity, in the post-epidemic period, will have a suppressive effect on the epidemic.
意大利的年轻人并未被要求“居家隔离”，看到街上人头攒动，意大利病毒学家罗伯托·布里奥尼3月4日在脸书上发文说：“我感觉很多人并不清楚我们的处境，过于平静的新闻报道，导致公民低估了（新冠疫情）这一问题。
"I feel like a lot of people are not aware of our situation," said Roberto Brioni, an Italian virologist who wrote on Facebook on Thursday. "Too calm a news report has led citizens to underestimate the problem.
”3月1日，意大利总理孔特签署的疫情防控法令将意大利全国按疫情严重程度分为三个部分。
On March 1, the decree signed by Italian Prime Minister Matteo Conte divided Italy into three parts, depending on the severity of the outbreak.
最早暴发疫情的市镇列为“红区”，城内居民不许擅自离城，所有公共活动全部取消，学校停课，博物馆和其他文化场所全部关闭。
The first affected towns were classified as "red zones," in which residents were not allowed to leave the city without permission, all public events were cancelled, schools were closed and museums and other cultural sites were closed.
红区周边的“黄区”内所有医护人员暂停休假；暂停集会、体育和其他各类竞赛活动；学校停课一周；继续关闭影院、迪厅；重新开放博物馆和可以提供送餐服务的咖啡馆、餐馆、酒吧，但博物馆要求参观者之间的距离要保持一米以上。
All medical staff in the "yellow zone" surrounding the Red Zone are on leave; rallies, sports and other competitions are suspended; schools are closed for one week; cinemas, disco rooms continue to be closed; museums and cafes, restaurants and bars where meals can be delivered are reopened, but the museum requires the distance between visitors to be more than one metre.
其余则为正常区域。
The rest are normal areas.
意大利卫生部门发布的10条防疫建议将“勤洗手”列在第一位，甚至心细地提醒“中国制造的产品和包裹无危险”，以及“宠物不能传播新冠病毒”，同时建议“仅在怀疑自己生病或帮助病人时才使用口罩”。
Italy's 10 health authorities have put "frequent hand washing" at the top of their list, even reminding "Chinese-made products and parcels are safe" and "pets can't transmit the new crown virus," suggesting that "masks should be used only when suspected of being sick or helping patients."
2月26日，一名无症状议员还因戴着口罩进入议会而遭到群嘲。
On 26 February, an asymptomatic parliamentarian was also the subject of a mob scene for entering Parliament wearing a mask.
戴口罩，还是不戴口罩1月25日下午，王琬茹结束假期旅行回到米兰，刚下飞机，马上找到机场药店，买了50个口罩。
On the afternoon of January 25, Carmen Wang returned from a vacation trip to Milan. He had just disembarked from a plane and went to the airport pharmacy to buy 50 masks.
朋友发信息给她：米兰市区已经买不到了，口罩疯涨到5欧元一个。
The friend sends a message to her: Milan downtown already cannot buy, the mask rises crazily to 5 euros one.
“当时想着有备无患，没想到这么快就用上了。
"I thought of being prepared, but I didn't expect to use it so soon.
”王琬茹对《中国新闻周刊》说。
"Carmen Wang told China News Weekly.
1月底的米兰街头还感受不到新冠病毒的威胁，人们如常出门喝酒、聚会、跳舞。
At the end of January, the streets of Milan were not threatened by the new crown virus, and people often went out for drinks, parties and dances.
“当地人重视疫情是在一号病人出现之后。
"The local population values the outbreak after the emergence of patient number one.
这个人很年轻，而不是通常以为的抵抗力差的老年人。
This man is very young, not the old man with low resistance as is commonly supposed.
这个人病情恶化后转入重症治疗，现已经治愈出院。
The patient deteriorated and was referred to intensive care, where he has now been cured.
”吴杰回忆道。
"recalled Wu Jie.
一号病人的消息传开后，米兰当地超市的部分货物被抢购一空。
As word spread of the number one case, the local supermarket in Milan was partially sold out.
王琬茹印象中，脱销的不只是消毒水，还有意大利面和肉酱，不过周末一过，超市货架很快又补全了。
Carmen Wang's impression was that he was selling not only disinfectant but also pasta and sauces, but as soon as the weekend was over, supermarket shelves were quickly restocked.
当时，也有本地老爷爷戴着手套来采购，收银员看到王琬茹戴口罩会嘟囔两句“病毒、冠状病毒”。
At the time, local grandpa wore gloves to buy, the cashier saw Carmen Wang wearing masks will mutter "virus, coronavirus."
“华人出门基本都是戴口罩的，当地人见了会绕着走。
"Chinese usually wear masks when they go out, and locals walk around when they see them.
”王琬茹说，当时商贩手中的口罩价格已经翻到了10欧元。
Carmen Wang said the price of masks in the hands of traders had risen to 10 euros.
身在中部城市佛罗伦萨的意大利中意青年联合会会长郑再生也面临着“戴口罩、还是不戴口罩”的困难选择。
Zheng Regan, president of the Italian Association of Chinese Youth in the central city of Florence, also faces the difficult choice of wearing a mask or not.
佛罗伦萨是托斯卡纳大区的首府，2月25日出现首例患者，到目前共确诊23例。
Florence, the capital of the Tuscany region, had its first case on 25 February and 23 cases have been confirmed so far.
郑再生戴口罩去超市或商场，都会引起当地人侧目，他觉得不自在，就把口罩摘下来放到衣服口袋里。
Zheng regenerated wearing a mask to the supermarket or shopping mall, will cause local people to look askance, he felt uncomfortable, took off his mask and put it in his pocket.
一方面担心被传染，另一方面也是避免被污名化。
Fear of contagion, on the one hand, and avoiding stigmatization, on the other.
当地华人一直在强调少出门、停工停学。
The local Chinese have been emphasizing less going out and suspension.
目前，托斯卡纳大区约有1300名中国移民自愿在家隔离。
At present, about 1,300 Chinese immigrants in the Tuscany region are living in voluntary isolation at home.
温州人李加越与妻子一同创办的马尔凯国际中文学校位于意大利中部的马尔凯大区，当地有4万多名华人华侨。
The Marche International Chinese School, founded by Wenzhou native Li Jiayue together with his wife, is located in the Marche region in central Italy, where more than 40,000 Chinese live.
由于新冠肺炎的出现，学校2月初开始停课，从2月24日开始线上授课。
With the advent of new crown pneumonia, the school began to close in early February, with online classes starting on 24 February.
当时，很多意大利本地学校还没停课，担心被传染、请假在家的学生还需要向学校出具医生开的证明。
At the time, many of Italy's local schools were still open, and students who feared infection and were on leave had to produce a doctor's certificate to the school.
形成反差的是，意大利当地民众对新冠疫情似乎并不在乎。
By contrast, the local Italian population does not seem to care about the new crown.
当地媒体在罗马街头采访“不戴口罩出门怕不怕”时，一位满头白发的男子笑着反问“怕什么怕？”一位80多岁的奶奶拍着手说，“我岁数也大了，该入土就入土，该死就死，再见。
A grey-haired man smiled and asked, "What are you afraid of?" An 80-year-old grandmother clapped her hands and said, "I'm too old to go to the ground and die. Goodbye.
”年轻的商品工作人员表示自己“既强壮又年轻，不会被感染”，也有人义正辞言地说“这就是流感，卫生就够了，stop，有人害怕是因为他们傻。
"Young commodity workers say they are" strong and young to be infected, "while others are right to say," This is the flu, hygiene is enough, stop, some people are scared because they're stupid. "
”“只有在感染症状的时候才需要戴口罩。
"Wear a mask only if you have symptoms of infection.
”“意大利人认为，只有生病的人才戴口罩，戴口罩不如勤洗手。
"Italians think only sick people wear masks and masks are better than frequent hand-washing.
而且，既然生病了，就减少外出，因此当地人看到戴口罩的就绕着走，不一定是歧视。
And since you're sick, go out less, so locals don't necessarily discriminate when they see people wearing masks walking around.
”旅居意大利8年的华人艺术工作者宁志远对《中国新闻周刊》说，他所在城市不在红区，疫情发生后居家办公，有限几次外出采购，他也没戴口罩。
Ning Zhiyuan, an eight-year-old Chinese artist who lives in Italy, told China News Weekly that his city was not in the red zone, that he worked from home after the outbreak, that he went out shopping only a few times and that he was not wearing a mask.
当地人对口罩的抵触也有法律原因。
There are also legal reasons for local resistance to masks.
1975年，意大利制定全国性反恐法，严格禁止在公共场合穿任何可能掩盖面部的服装、无法识别的口罩或器具，违反者将面临罚款和监禁，2005年，意大利参议院通过一系列反恐法规，将惩罚提高至最高两年监禁和2000欧元罚款。
In 1975, Italy had enacted a national anti-terrorism law that strictly prohibited the wearing in public of any clothing that might conceal a face, an unidentified mask or appliance, and violators faced fines and imprisonment. In 2005, the Italian Senate had adopted a series of anti-terrorism legislation raising the penalty to a maximum of two years' imprisonment and a fine of 2,000 euros.
“我不支持公众戴口罩，这不是正确的公共卫生措施。
"I don't support the public wearing of masks, which is not the right public health measure.
”阿梅什·阿达利亚直言，口罩对普通民众没有作用，应该留给有需要的医护人员，抢购口罩的恐慌可能会导致医院出现短缺。
Amesh Adalia bluntly said the mask had no effect on the general public and should be reserved for those in need, and panic buying of masks could lead to a shortage of hospitals.
现实情况是，现在意大利已经“一罩难求”。
The reality is that Italy is now "in a bind."
中意直飞航班停飞前，身在米兰的温州市文成县籍华侨张罗了共计10万多个口罩，由米兰至温州的最后一班飞往国内，送到抗疫一线。
Before the stop of the direct flight between China and Italy, the overseas Chinese from Wencheng County of Wenzhou, Milan, Zhang Luo a total of more than 100,000 masks, from Milan to Wenzhou the last flight to the domestic, sent to the front of the epidemic.
“现在反过来，文成侨联、上海文成商会又在筹集口罩捐给我们。
"Now, in turn, Wencheng Overseas Chinese Association and Shanghai Wencheng Chamber of Commerce are raising masks for us.
”意大利北部华侨华人餐饮协会会长周斌对《中国新闻周刊》说。
Zhou Bin, president of the Association of Chinese Restaurants in Northern Italy, told China News Weekly.
尽管新冠感染早期轻症患者仍具有传染性，但与中国情况不同的是，意大利“相对来说人口密度小，不太容易造成人和人之间的近距离飞沫传播”。
Although early-stage mild cases of infection remain contagious, unlike in China, Italy is "relatively sparsely populated and less prone to human-to-human transmission of close droplets."
美国加州大学洛杉矶分校公共卫生学院副院长张作风说，“防疫措施要适合当地国情，最后殊途同归。
"Preventive measures need to be tailored to local conditions," said Zhang style, vice president of UCLA School of Public Health.
”就算封城，橘子大战也要继续到2月23日，意大利累计确诊感染数增至152人，日增一倍，但身处疫区皮尔蒙特大区的小镇伊夫雷亚照常举行了年度“橘子大战”，为期三天，这是伊夫雷亚狂欢节的高潮。
Even with the closure of the city, orange wars will continue until Feb. 23, when the cumulative number of confirmed infections in Italy doubled to 152, but the annual "Orange Wars," the culmination of the three-day Evelyn Carnival, was held in Iverea, a small town in the affected region.
“我们知道正在承担的风险，但狂欢节对我们意义重大。
"We know the risks we are taking, but Carnival means a lot to us.
”一位参加节日活动的当地人接受视频采访时说，现场几乎没有人戴口罩。
In a video interview with locals attending the festivities, few people were wearing masks at the scene.
这一世界上最古老的节日之一起源于欧洲中世纪时代。
One of the oldest festivals in the world dates back to medieval Europe.
据统计，受疫情影响，参与人数较往年减少，当天约有15000人聚众“裸奔”了一天。
According to statistics, affected by the epidemic, the number of participants than in previous years, about 15,000 people gathered to "run naked" for a day.
3月8日，在意大利伦巴第大区米兰中央火车站内，一对男女隔着口罩亲吻。
A man and a woman kiss through a mask at Milan Central Railway Station in Lombardy, Italy, on 8 March.
摄影/达尼埃莱·马斯科洛另一边，意大利中央政府对十余个市镇采取了交通限制，对宣布病例报告数最多的伦巴第大区和威尼托大区要求停课一周。
Photography / Daniele Muscolo On the other hand, the central Government of Italy imposed traffic restrictions on more than a dozen municipalities, with one week's suspension requested for the Lombardy and Veneto regions, which reported the highest number of reported cases.
当地学生接到通知后结队游行，庆祝天上掉下来的假期。
The local students were notified to march in procession to celebrate the fall of the day.
就在伦巴第大区施行“宵禁”的第四天，因酒吧、俱乐部和迪斯科舞厅的老板们集体请愿，米兰市政府2月26日又取消了对酒吧等娱乐场所晚上6时后不得营业的禁令。
On the fourth day of the curfew in the Lombardy region, a ban on bars and other entertainment establishments from operating after 6 p.m. was lifted on 26 February following a collective petition by owners of bars, clubs and discotheques.
重新开业的酒吧被要求“尽量控制客流量”，客人不能在吧台就餐，需要由服务员将餐饮送到餐桌，并要求客人与客人之间保持一米以上距离。
Reopened bars are required to "try to control passenger flow," guests can not eat at the bar, need to be delivered to the table by waiters and guests to maintain a distance of more than one meter.
“意大利人天性如此，喜欢自由不羁的生活，在很多事情上比较随意，而且还喜欢聚集交谈。
Italians are by nature bohemian, enjoy a free-wheeling life, are more casual in many things, and enjoy conversing together.
但是我个人认为，在过去两周时间里，意大利卫生部门和政界对新冠病毒的认知明显存在一定程度的混乱，对于如何防控疫情始终未形成一致的主流意见，对民众的宣传不到位，也是导致不同地区行动反差如此之大及疫情不断升级的一个重要原因。
But I personally believe that the past two weeks have been marked by a degree of confusion in Italian health and political perceptions of the new crown virus, a persistent lack of consensus on how to control the epidemic, a lack of sensitization of the population, and an important reason for the disparity in action and the escalation of the epidemic in different regions.
” 孙彦红分析说。
"said Sun.
然而，《新欧洲侨报》总编辑吴杰却不这么认为，律师出身的意大利总理孔特一早就通过议会授权公卫专家、传染病专家来指导疫情防控，“政治系统和卫生系统的声音是一致的。
Not according to Wu Jie, editor-in-chief of New European Diaspora, Italy's lawyer-turned-prime minister, Conte, early on gave parliamentary authorization to public health experts and infectious disease experts to direct the epidemic. "The political and health systems speak with one voice.
”吴杰说。
"said Wu Jie.
意大利各地没有同时采取统一的防疫措施，其实与其国家治理体系架构有关。
Italy has not adopted a unified epidemic prevention measures, in fact its national governance system structure.
意大利分为20个区、98个省、8099个市镇，实行的是中央—大区—省—市的四级国家管理体制。
Italy is divided into 20 regions, 98 provinces, 8099 municipalities, the implementation of the central-regional-provincial-municipal four-level state management system.
不同级别政府的权责有明确的法律规定。
The responsibilities of the different levels of government are clearly defined by law.
例如，中央政府负责国家层面事务，如外交，大区建制后，享有立法权，主抓医疗、教育等公共服务，省、市镇政府则负责经济发展、科技文化等具体的民生工作。
For example, the central government is responsible for matters at the national level, such as foreign affairs and regional organizations. It has legislative power, focusing on public services such as health care and education, while provincial and municipal governments are responsible for economic development, science and technology, culture and other specific civic tasks.
“每个大区可以按照自己的情况进行调整，不必和总理法令完全一致。
"Each region can adapt to its own circumstances and does not have to be fully aligned with the Prime Minister's decree.
”吴杰解释说，中部马尔凯大区曾在零确诊时下令关闭大区内所有学校，中央政府还因此批评该大区停学过早、影响了学生学习。
Wu explained that the central Marche region had ordered the closure of all schools in the region at the time of the zero diagnosis, which had led the central Government to criticize the suspension of schooling in the region as premature and detrimental to students' learning.
诸如伦巴第大区酒吧施行宵禁、再解禁的做法，看上去左右摇摆，“实则是出于维持经济正常运行的考虑。
Curfews and re-bans, such as those imposed by the Lombardy bar, appear to sway "out of concern for the proper functioning of the economy."
”中国前驻意大利、瑞士大使董津义对《中国新闻周刊》说，“从中央到地方，实际上都在寻求防疫与经济发展的平衡点。
Dong Zinyi, a former Chinese ambassador to Italy and Switzerland, told China News Weekly: "From the central government to the local level, we are actually seeking a balance between epidemic prevention and economic development.
”意大利最终被封的省、市镇集中在北部伦巴第大区、威尼托大区和艾米利亚—罗马涅大区，这也是该国人口最密集、经济发达的地区。
The provinces and municipalities that were eventually sealed off in Italy are concentrated in the northern regions of Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia Romagna, which is also the most densely populated and economically developed region in the country.
以伦巴第大区为例，人均GDP高于意大利其他地区30％左右，2017年欧盟统计局数据显示，该大区GDP高居整个欧洲地区第二。
In the Lombardy region, for example, GDP per capita is about 30% higher than in the rest of Italy, and Eurostat data for 2017 shows that the region has the second highest GDP in the entire European region.
伦巴第大区首府米兰和威尼托大区的威尼斯是旅游胜地，疫情暴发后，成千上万的酒店订单与航班被取消。
Venice, the capital of the Lombardy region and Venetian in the Veneto region, was a tourist destination, with thousands of hotel orders and flights cancelled after the outbreak.
意大利旅游业联合会主席卢卡·帕塔尼估计，到5月底，作为意大利经济支柱的旅游业将遭受约74亿欧元的损失。
Luca Pattani, President of the Italian Tourism Federation, estimates that by the end of May the tourism industry, the mainstay of the Italian economy, will suffer losses of approximately 7.4 billion euros.
“在不久的将来，游客数量将几乎为零。
