面临的最大挑战仍然是部门利益藩篱疫情当前之际，2月10日，全国人大常委会法工委表示，已部署启动《野生动物保护法》（下称《野保法》）修改工作，拟增加列入全国人大常委会今年的立法工作计划，并加快动物防疫法等法律的修改进程。
On February 10, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) said it had deployed work to amend the Wildlife Protection Law to add to the Standing Committee's legislative work plan for this year, and to speed up the revision of animal epidemic prevention laws.
另悉，将于2月24日召开的十三届全国人大常委会第十六次会议，将审议关于禁止非法野生动物交易、革除滥食野生动物陋习、切实保障人民群众生命健康安全的相关议案。
The 16th meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), scheduled to be held on February 24, will consider relevant bills on banning illegal wildlife trading, eliminating abuses of wildlife, and ensuring people's lives, health and safety.
这是继2016年之后，《野保法》迎来的又一次修订契机。
This is after 2016, the wild insurance law ushered in another opportunity to revise.
消息公布之前，众多动物保护人士、学者和机构发声倡议修法。
Before the announcement, a number of animal rights activists, academics and institutions advocated the amendment of the law.
1月23日，19名来自全国高校与科研院所的院士、学者联名倡议，由全国人大紧急修订《野保法》，将公共健康安全的内容纳入到野生动物利用的条款中。
On 23 January, at the initiative of 19 academicians and scholars from universities and research institutes across the country, the National People's Congress urgently amended the Wild Insurance Law to include public health and safety in the provisions on the utilization of wild animals.
1月28日，中国环境报、北京林业大学生态法研究中心、中国政法大学环境资源法研究和服务中心、“自然之友”四家机构单位联合发起立法禁食野生动物建议书。
On January 28, the China Environment News, the Center for Ecological Law Studies of Beijing Forestry University, the Research and Service Center for Environmental Resources Law of the Chinese University of Political Science and Law and the Friends of Nature jointly launched a proposal to ban wild animals.
“《野保法》是临时加进人大立法计划的，相当于插班生，未来的修订时间线尚不明确。
"The Wild Life Insurance Law is a temporary addition to the legislative program of the National People's Congress, equivalent to an interlude, and the timeline for future revisions is unclear.
”“自然之友”总法律顾问刘金梅向《中国新闻周刊》提到。
"Friends of Nature" general counsel Liu Jinmei told China News Weekly.
据她分析，将于2月24日召开的十三届全国人大常委会第十六次会议，可能会确定《野保法》的基本修改方向；待修订草案出炉后，通常由内部专家先行论证，通过后再对外发布征求意见稿。
According to her analysis, the 16th meeting of the Standing Committee of the 13th National People's Congress (NPC) on February 24th may set the direction of basic amendments to the Wild Insurance Law.
“如果争议特别大，草案还需经历一审、二审甚至三审，每一轮都需要公开征求意见。
"If it is particularly controversial, it will have to go through first, second and even third trials, and each round will require an open consultation process.
”刘金梅据此认为，《野保法》的最终修订或需等到年底。
Liu Jinmei accordingly believed that the final revision of the law would have to wait until the end of the year.
焦点不止于“全面禁食”现行《野保法》规定，受保护的野生动物是指“珍贵、濒危的陆生、水生野生动物和有重要生态、科学、社会价值的陆生野生动物”。
The current Wild Animal Protection Law stipulates that protected wildlife refers to "rare and endangered terrestrial and aquatic wildlife as well as terrestrial wildlife of important ecological, scientific and social value."
并非所有野生动物都被纳入保护范围。
Not all wild animals are covered.
根据北京大学和山水自然保护中心的梳理，被保护物种累计仅占中国总记录哺乳类、鸟类以及两栖和爬行类动物物种数的62.71%，仍有1077种未受到名录保护。
According to Peking University and Landscape Nature Conservation Center, only 62.71 percent of China's total recorded mammal, bird, amphibious and reptile species are protected, and 1,077 remain unprotected.
在接受《中国新闻周刊》采访时，中国人与生物圈国家委员会委员周海翔强调，《野保法》只注重保护处于生物塔塔尖的珍贵、濒危物种，而忽视处于塔基和塔身的其他物种，缺乏对生态安全问题的考量。
In an interview with China News Weekly, Zhou Haixiang, a member of China's Biosphere and People's Biosphere Commission, stressed that the law only focused on protecting valuable and endangered species at the spire of the biological tower, while neglecting other species at the base and tower, and lacked consideration for ecological safety.
“只有塔基和塔身物种的数量够多，才能够养活塔尖的物种，维持整个生态系统的平衡。
"Only a large enough number of taki and tower species can support the spire species and maintain the balance of the entire ecosystem.
”北京大学保护生物学教授吕植则从公共卫生风险角度，向《中国新闻周刊》阐释了她的观点：“病原体并不挑剔宿主动物是否受保护，而恰恰是不在重点保护名录上的动物，蝙蝠、果子狸、旱獭、刺猬……成为动物与人类共患疾病的自然宿主或中间宿主。
Lu Zheng, a professor of conservation biology at Peking University, explained her view to China News Weekly from the point of view of public health risks: "Pathogens do not judge whether host animals are protected, but rather animals that are not on the list of priority protectors, bats, beavers, woodchucks, hedgehogs... as natural hosts or intermediate hosts of diseases that animals share with humans.
”这些高风险物种不受《野保法》保护，为新发传染病的出现埋下隐患。
These high-risk species are not protected by the Wild Insurance Act, laying the groundwork for new infectious diseases.
学者吕植、公益机构“自然之友”等为此提出全面禁食野生动物的立法建议。
Scholar Lu Zhi, the public welfare organization "Friends of Nature" and other legislative proposals for a total ban on wildlife.
根据吕植等人的新近调查，近10万份的问卷中，96.4%的人选择支持全面禁食，公众对禁食野味的呼声猛烈。
According to a recent survey by Lu Zhi et al., 96.4 percent of the nearly 100,000 people surveyed chose to support a total fast and the public clamour for a ban was fierce.
不过，学界对全面禁食并未取得共识。
However, there is no academic consensus on a total fast.
北京林业大学生态法研究中心主任杨朝霞建议分类施策，对国家重点保护野生动物、地方重点保护野生动物和“三有动物”，严禁食用，但人工繁育技术成熟、国务院野生动物主管部门认为可以食用且经检疫合格的除外。
Yang Chaoxia, director of the Center for Ecological Law Research at Beijing Forestry University, recommends categorizing and giving advice on the protection of wildlife under special state protection, wildlife under special local protection and "three animals."
中国政法大学校长马怀德日前组织成立了针对《野保法》修订的课题组，该课题组则认为，妥善处理好滥食野生动物与合法食用野生动物、野生动物绝对保护与野生动物的科学保护、传统的摒弃与传统的继承和发扬、环境保护、食品安全与经济发展等关系，“不宜将全面禁止野生动物食用和交易的短期措施法律化、长期化”。
The vice-president of the Chinese University of Political Science and Law, Wang Huide, has set up a task force to discuss the revision of the Wild Animal Welfare Law. The task force considers it inappropriate to legalize and lengthen short-term measures to ban wildlife consumption and trade properly.
关于“全面禁食”的争议甚嚣尘上。
Controversy has flared up over a "total fasting."
“吃或不吃是个难以达成共识的立场问题，没必要质疑对方的出发点。
"Eating or not eating is a difficult position to reach, and there is no need to question the other person's starting point.
需要注意的是，一味局限在对立场的讨论，对修法其实难有助益。
It should be borne in mind that a discussion of positions is not conducive to legislative reform.
”刘金梅提醒称，消费环节处于野生动物利益链条的末端，《野保法》的修订焦点不止于此。
Liu Jinmei cautioned that the consumer chain was at the end of the wildlife profit chain and that the focus of the revision of the Wild Care Act went beyond that.
从猎捕、养殖、宰杀、运输、制成食品到销售，每个环节都需要法律的规制。
Every link from hunting, breeding, slaughtering, transporting and preparing food to selling needs to be regulated by law.
“以检验检疫来说，需要确保野味在每个环节都按照食品的级别去控制风险。
"In terms of inspection and quarantine, it is important to ensure that game is controlled at every level according to the level of the food.
一种野生动物可能携带哪些病毒和细菌？有没有针对性的检疫标准？检疫要求如何落地？这些都是不容忽视的问题。
What viruses and bacteria can a wild animal carry? Are there any quarantine standards? How do quarantine requirements land? These are problems that cannot be ignored.
”刘金梅说。
"said Liu.
包括立法目的、保护范围、人工繁育、检验检疫、售卖、食用、信息公开和公众参与等，都是此次修法的可能范畴。
Including legislative purposes, scope of protection, artificial breeding, inspection and quarantine, sale, consumption, information disclosure and public participation are all possible areas for the amendment.
刘金梅告诉《中国新闻周刊》，目前她所在团队已完成《野保法》修改意见的起草工作。
Liu told China News Weekly that her team had completed the drafting of amendments to the Wild Insurance Law.
关键是打破部门利益中国现行的《野保法》于1988年制定通过，翌年实施。
The key is to break the departmental interests China's current Wild Insurance Law was enacted in 1988 and came into force the following year.
此后几经修订，其中2004年、2009年两次修正属于微调，唯2013年启动的修法动作最大、改动最多，至2016年7月才定稿。
Since then, several revisions have been made, two of which were minor in 2004 and 2009, with the exception of those initiated in 2013, which were the most dynamic and the most varied, and finalized only in July 2016.
2016年《野保法》草案的公布，在法学界和动物保护圈引起强烈争议。
The publication of the 2016 draft Wild Care Act has caused strong controversy in the legal profession and animal protection circles.
不少人认为草案继续视野生动物为一种经济资源，并承认了“利用”的合理性，实为“利用法”而非“保护法”。
Many people believe that the draft continues to treat wild animals as an economic resource, and acknowledge the reasonableness of "utilization," rather than "protection laws."
有学者提出，草案中保护、驯养繁殖和开发利用三者并列，保护的内容只占三份之一，与“保护”的主题不符。
Some scholars suggest that the draft law of conservation, domestication and breeding, development and utilization are juxtaposed, the protection of only one third of the content, and "protection" does not fit the theme.
长期关注野生动物权益的公益组织“自然之友”，曾受邀参加全国人大组织的座谈会。
Friends of Nature, a long-time wildlife advocacy group, was invited to a symposium organized by the National People's Congress.
“自然之友”总干事张伯驹向《中国新闻周刊》回忆，彼时会上，与会者分为支持保护与支持利用两派，而后者的声音明显占了上风。
Zhang Bocoli, director-general of Friends of Nature, recalled to China News that participants at the meeting split between pro-protection and pro-use groups, with the latter's voice clearly prevailing.
当时，“自然之友”针对信息公开、公众参与、野生动物利用等几个方面，在修订草案公开征求意见期间提交了修改意见。
At that time, Friends of Nature submitted amendments to the revised draft during the public consultation on information disclosure, public participation and wildlife use.
“但很遗憾，新《野保法》对公众意见的吸收极为有限，在信息公开和公众参与方面几无建树，在争议最多的野生动物利用问题上，也没有实质性的改变。
"Unfortunately, there has been very limited uptake of public opinion in the new Wild Life Act, little has been achieved in terms of access to information and public participation, and there has been no substantial change in the most controversial use of wildlife.
”张伯驹说。
"said the colt.
多名受访者认为，《野保法》修订阻碍重重，根源在于野生动物产业背后的庞大产业利益。
A number of respondents said the obstacles to amending the Wild Life Act were rooted in the huge industrial interests behind the wildlife industry.
据统计，我国2004年全国野生动物驯养繁殖场就达到1.6万多家，年产值达到200多亿元。
According to statistics, in 2004 China had more than 16,000 wildlife breeding centers, with an annual output value of over 20 billion yuan.
另据中国工程院咨询研究项目公开发布的《中国野生动物养殖产业可持续发展战略研究报告》，2016年中国野生动物养殖产业的从业者1409多万左右，创造产值达5206多亿元。
According to a study on sustainable development strategies for China's wildlife industry, published by the consulting and research project of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, in 2016 more than 14.09 million people were employed in China's wildlife industry, generating a total output value of more than 520.6 billion yuan.
《报告》提到，“野生动物养殖产业已经成为国民经济中最具发展活力和后劲的重要产业之一。
"Wildlife farming has become one of the most dynamic and backward industries in the national economy," the report said.
”野生动物摄影师奚志农亦曾参与上一次的《野保法》修订。
Wildlife photographer Keesh Zhinong was also involved in the last revision of the Wild Life Act.
他发现从法律层面到实践层面，均存在浓厚的野生动物利用思维。
He found that from the legal level to the practical level, there are strong thinking about the utilization of wild animals.
“比如当时我注意到，中国野生动物保护协会居然设有产业管理处，专门提供野生动物及其产品产业的国内外交流和中介服务。
"I noticed at the time, for example, that the China Wildlife Conservation Association had an industry bureau that provided domestic and international exchanges and brokering services for wildlife and their products.
”奚志农说。
"said Keesh Zhinong.
今年2月16日，中国野生动物保护协会下属的蛙类养殖专业委员会（下称蛙类养殖委）发布原创文章《野生动物养殖是人类祖先的伟大创举》，声称“因一次疫情就全面禁野将是武断的”“人类对野生动物产品的需求从未停止，某种意义上说已经成为刚性需求”。
"It would be arbitrary to ban all wildlife products because of an outbreak," said the frogs' professional committee on frogs under the China Wildlife Conservation Association (CCAFF) on Feb. 16 this year.
文章引起争议后，中国野生动物保护协会被迫发声明致歉，并表态撤销蛙类养殖委。
After the controversy, the China Wildlife Conservation Association was forced to issue a statement apologizing, and announced the abolition of frogs breeding commission.
亦有分析认为，在保护野生动物方面，主管部门国家林草局应该承担更多的责任。
It has also been argued that the National Forest Service, the competent authority, should take more responsibility for wildlife conservation.
2019年该局发布的《国家林业和草原局关于促进林草产业高质量发展的指导意见》在“重点工作”一项提到：以非重点保护动物为主攻方向，培育一批特种养殖基地和养殖大户，提升繁育能力，扩大种群规模，增加市场供给。
In 2019, the State Forestry and Grassland Administration's Guidelines for the Promotion of Quality Development of the Forest and Grassland Industry mentions in the Key Work item: Cultivating a number of special breeding bases and large-scale farmed farmers, mainly in the direction of non-priority animal protection, so as to enhance breeding capacity, expand population size and increase market supply.
“2016年的修法，最大障碍就是部门利益。
"In the 2016 revision, the biggest hurdle is sectoral interests.
修法没能打破它，反而将它固化了。
Instead of breaking it, the practice solidified it.
”刘金梅认为，时至今日《野保法》再行修订，面临的最大挑战仍然是部门利益藩篱。
Ms Liu believes that the biggest challenge facing the revision of the law today is still the division's profit barrier.
包括刘金梅在内，多名受访者认为打补丁式的修法无法改变野生动物保护困局，而寄希望于对整部法律的重新梳理和细化。
Many respondents, including Liu, said patchwork amendments would not change the wildlife-conservation dilemma, hoping for a overhaul and refinement of the law.
“经历了上次非典和《野保法》的修改，我知道就目前情况来说，要实现长期禁止商业利用野生动物资源和食用野味，难度依然很大。
"After the last revision of SARS and the Wild Animal Health Act, I know that the long-term ban on the commercial use of wildlife resources and game is still very difficult in the current situation.
但我相信，在疫情肆虐这个当口，舆论的赞同呼声会比那时候要强得多。
But I believe that at this juncture, when the epidemic is raging, public opinion will be much stronger than it was then.
