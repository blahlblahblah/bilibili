2月份以来已有超过60个城市出台了楼市相关的调控政策，不过在房地产政策调控群中，近日驻马店、广州“撤回了一条消息”。
More than 60 cities have introduced housing-related regulations since February, but among the real estate regulatory group, Ma-dian recently, Guangzhou "withdrew a message."
3月4日，广州关于楼市放松的相关政策被叫停；3月5日，驻马店发布的17项稳楼市政策已从官网撤下。
On March 4, Guangzhou's policy on the relaxation of the housing market was halted. On March 5, 17 stable housing policies issued by the Ma store were removed from the official website.
广州和驻马店先后撤下相关文件，再次引发大众对楼市调控走向的关注。
Guangzhou and Ma shop have removed the relevant documents, re-aroused public attention to the trend of regulation of the housing market.
疫情冲击房地产，超60地发布新调控政策　　据不完全统计，2月份，有超过60个城市发布了不同程度的房地产调控政策。
Epidemic hit real estate, more than 60 issued a new regulatory policy According to incomplete statistics, in February, more than 60 cities issued varying degrees of real estate control policies.
比如深圳、杭州、上海、合肥等均有减免物业租金、延期缴社保费、减免和延期缴纳税款等政策。
For example, Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Shanghai, Hefei and other policies such as rent relief, deferred social insurance contributions, relief and deferred payment of taxes.
这些政策主要缓和企业短期内应付账款压力，以稳为主。
These policies mainly ease the short-term accounts payable pressure to stabilize the main.
济南、西安、杭州、天津等十余城为应对疫情，明确土地款可申请延期或分期缴付。
Jinan, Xi'an, Hangzhou, Tianjin and other cities in response to the epidemic, clear land can apply for extension or installment payment.
另外，黄山、苏州等地修改土地要求现房销售的政策，适度放宽楼盘的预售条件。
In addition, Huangshan, Suzhou and other places to revise the current land demand sales policy, moderate relaxation of the pre-sale conditions of real estate.
而深圳、芜湖、惠州、大连、呼和浩特、武汉、南宁等城市出台了缓缴公积金、降低公积金缴存比例等政策。
Shenzhen, Wuhu, Huizhou, Dalian, Huhhot, Wuhan, Nanning and other cities issued a deferred accumulation fund, reduce the percentage of contributions to the reserve fund and other policies.
这些城市中，以三四线城市居多。
Among these cities, three or four-line cities predominate.
中原地产首席分析师张大伟当时分析，2月份的房地产市场政策主要以支持房地产企业，减少企业资金压力、延缓公积金月供为主。
Zhang Dawei, central real estate chief analyst at the time, analyzed that February's real estate market policy is mainly to support real estate companies, reduce corporate financial pressure, the main delay provident fund monthly payments.
广州、驻马店两地急刹车，踩到什么线了？　　60多地中，广州、驻马店的政策分别上演“一日游”、“半月谈”。
Guangzhou, Ma shop in both places brake sharply, stepped on what line? In more than 60, Guangzhou, Ma store policies staged "one day tour," "half a month talk."
先来看驻马店的政策是怎么回事。
Let's see what the store policy is.
驻马店被撤下的文件全称是《关于进一步规范促进房地产业平稳健康发展的意见》，其中有17项稳楼市政策，包括“要求金融机构适度下调个人住房按揭贷款利率，首套房贷款最低首付比例由30%下调为20%”。
The documents removed from the store are all called Opinions on Further Standardization of the Stable and Healthy Development of the Real Estate Industry, and contain 17 policies aimed at stabilizing the housing market, including "Requiring financial institutions to reduce the personal mortgage lending rate moderately, and reducing the minimum down payment rate for first home loans from 30% to 20%."
这是此次疫情期间第一个明确提出降低购房首付的城市。
It was the first city to explicitly cut down on down payments during the epidemic.
另外，内容还包括对在市中心城区、各县城区购买首套居住房屋的人给予补助，包括各类人才补助标准200元/人、大中专以上毕业生补助标准150元/人，农民工补助标准100元/人等。
In addition, it includes subsidies for the purchase of first-time housing units in inner-city areas and urban districts of counties, including 200 yuan per person for various types of personnel subsidies, 150 yuan per person for graduates from colleges and universities and 100 yuan per person per person for peasant workers.
“驻马店本身去库存压力是非常大的。
"The pressure to go to the store itself is very high.
”同策集团首席分析师张宏伟表示，去年货币化安置比例大幅降低之后，整个市场的销售压力非常大，库存急剧上升。
Zhang Hongwei, chief analyst at Tazhong Group, said sales pressures across the market were strong and inventories rose sharply after last year's sharp fall in monetized resettlement.
“对于这样的城市来讲，应该采取一些定向宽松措施来去库存。
"For a city like this, some targeted easing should be taken to get inventories.
”　　中国社会科学院财经战略研究院研究员邹琳华认为，稳定房地产市场可以有很多对策，不能走到利用剌激房地产来拉动经济的旧路上。
Zou Linhua, a researcher at the Institute of Financial Strategy at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, believes there are many strategies to stabilize the property market that cannot go as far as stimulating real estate to prop up the economy.
“特别是购房融资杠杆，要严格控制，这关系到未来的系统性金融风险。
"In particular, the leverage for home financing should be strictly controlled, which is related to the future of systemic financial risks.
”　　再来看广州的具体文件。
"And look at the specific document for Guangzhou.
广州市政府3月3日发布了《广州市坚决打赢新冠肺炎疫情防控阻击战努力实现全年经济社会发展目标任务若干措施的通知》(以下简称“《通知》”)，其中有48条举措，包括：广州公寓、商铺等商办项目不再限定最小分割单元，不再限定销售对象。
Guangzhou Municipal Government on March 3 issued the "Guangzhou City Determined to Win the New Crown Pneumonia Prevention and Control Campaign to achieve the mission of economic and social development goals" (hereinafter referred to as "Notice"), which contains 48 measures, including: Guangzhou apartment, shops and other commercial projects no longer limit the minimum division units, no longer limited sales objects.
4日，《通知》被广州市政府官网撤下。
On the 4th, the Notice was removed by the Guangzhou Municipal Government's official website.
5日，“消失”的《通知》再次出现，但原本关于松绑商服类项目的政策条文已被删除。
On May 5, the "disappear" notice appeared again, but the original policy provisions on the liberalization of commercial services items have been deleted.
“此次政策删除了此前备受争议的商服认购内容，说明对一些敏感性的购房政策依然会斟酌，进一步体现了房住不炒的导向。
"This policy has removed the controversial subscription content of business clothes, indicating that some sensitive housing purchase policy will still be considered, further reflects the guidance of housing without speculation.
”易居研究院智库中心研究总监严跃进分析，广州政策的调整，也说明近期部分城市一些涉及购房领域的政策并不成熟，后续地方出台放松政策会更为谨慎。
Yan Yuejin, director of research at the Yi-Ju Institute's think tank, and the readjustment of Guangzhou's policies also suggest that some recent policies in some cities in the housing market are not mature enough to warrant further relaxation.
严跃进认为，此类政策之所以受关注，是因为两点。
Mr Yan argues that such policies attract attention for two reasons.
第一、商服类项目的管控一直被认为是打击炒房的一种手段，贸然放松会产生误解。
First, the control of commercial projects has been considered to be a means of combating speculation, precipitate relaxation can be misunderstood.
第二、广州为一线城市，率先放开的信号意义较大，所以政策调整会比较谨慎。
Second, Guangzhou as a first-tier city, the first signal of greater significance, so policy adjustments will be more cautious.
“根据疫情对政策作出调整是符合实际的，但是要以房住不炒为底线，不能鼓励或变相支持炒房。
"Adjusting the policy according to the epidemic situation is realistic, but the bottom line is not housing speculation, can not encourage or disguised support speculation.
”邹琳华说。
"said Zou Linhua.
房企的花式自救，下一步要怎么走？　　实际上，除了各地出台的相关房地产政策，房企“自救”方式也花样繁多。
Housing enterprise's fancy self-help, the next step to be taken? In fact, in addition to the relevant real estate policies, housing enterprises "self-help" methods are also varied.
打折促销、直播卖房、债券融资等都在此列。
Discount sales, live sales, bond financing and so on are included in this list.
绿地集团发布措施，缴纳认筹金5000元/套，签署《认购协议》的购房者除享受楼部优惠外，额外再享98折优惠；如果推荐新客户购买，奖励1%的佣金，再奖励5000元推荐奖金，并退回5000元认筹金。
Green Group issued measures to pay 5000 yuan / set of redemption fund. Buyers who have signed the Subscriptions Agreement enjoy an additional 98% discount in addition to the Department discount. If new customers are recommended to buy, they will be rewarded with a commission of 1%, a recommended bonus of $5,000 and a refund of $5,000.
近来，有关恒大的打折消息更是博人眼球。
Recently, about the constant big discount news is the blogger eyeball.
2月18日-29日，恒大全国各在售楼盘(含公寓及写字楼)实施7.5折优惠；3月1日-31日，则是7.8折优惠。
From February 18 to 29, the University will offer a discount of 7.5% on sales of flats (including apartments and office buildings) and a discount of 7.8% on March 1-31.
除了打折促销，恒大还称，全国613个楼盘可VR实景看房。
In addition to discount sales, Constant University also said that 613 buildings can be VR real-life housing.
目前，房天下、乐居等平台都上线了卖房直播。
At present, the housing world, such as the living platform on-line selling live.
“现阶段采取直播卖房，主要是因为短期内房企销售性、经营性的现金流有压力。
"At this stage to take a live sale, mainly because of short-term housing sales, operating cash flow pressure.
房企不得不通过直播或者降价的方式先储备一些意向认购的客户。
Housing companies have to live or reduce prices to reserve a number of intended customers.
”张宏伟这样点评打折促销和直播卖房。
Zhang Hongwei commented on discounts and live sales.
“通过发债，企业也可暂时获得一些融资性的现金，缓解短期内的资金压力。
"Through debt issuance, companies can also temporarily receive some financing cash to ease short-term funding pressures.
”他补充说。
'he added.
梳理显示，房企华夏幸福、万科等在2月份均发布过债券融资相关公告。
Comb shows, the housing enterprise Hua Xia happiness, Vanke etc. has issued bond financing related announcement in February.
如，万科拟公开发行不超过90亿元的公司债券，以及不超过30亿元的住房租赁专项公司债券。
For example, Vanke intends to issue corporate bonds of up to $9 billion and special company bonds for residential leases of up to $3 billion.
目前证监会已通过该两笔公司债券发行申请。
At present the SFC has approved the two company bond issue applications.
在张宏伟看来，这些措施只能说暂时缓解一下房企资金压力。
In Zhang's view, these measures can only be said to temporarily ease the pressure on housing finance.
由于销售不畅，市场还基本处于冷冻阶段，房企普遍性面临比较大的压力。
Because sales are not good, the market is still in the frozen stage, housing enterprise universality is facing greater pressure.
“接下来，预计会有一些定向宽松的政策去激活市场交易，让市场更快有序恢复。
"Next, some targeted easing is expected to kick-start market trading and allow markets to recover faster and more orderly."
”　　“直播卖房、打折促销等，在疫情未结束之前，作用并不很大。
"Live sales, discounted sales, etc., before the end of the epidemic, the role is not very large.
结束之后会有更大的作用。
It's going to make a big difference.
”邹琳华认为，未来楼市调控政策的底线依然是不支持炒房、不剌激购房。
Zou Linhua thinks, the bottom line of future estate market regulation policy is still not to support speculation, not stimulate the purchase of houses.
