疫情风暴中心的武汉，曾经承载我们悲欢日夜的小店还在倔强坚持。
Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic storm, once carried us sad day and night in the small shop is still stubborn persistence.

新冠疫情的肆虐，对各行各业都造成不小的冲击，企业纷纷亮起红灯。
The ravages of the new crown epidemic on all walks of life have caused no small impact, enterprises have a red light.
前有西贝老板在采访视频里说“现金撑不过三个月”，后来单向街书店通过官方微信号向大众众筹。
A former Sibbe boss said in an interview video that "cash won't last more than three months," and then one-way street bookstores raised money through official microsignals.
这些知名度高的品牌尚可通过媒体发声或求助，那些街头小店的老板们，特别是疫情风暴正中心的武汉创业者们，只能独自消化危机。
These high-profile brands can still be heard or turned to the media, and the owners of small street stores, especially Wuhan entrepreneurs, who are at the center of the storm, are left to fend for themselves.
樱花开了，春天到了，被疫情子弹击中的小店却一直停留在寒冷的冬季。
Cherry blossoms are blossoming, and the spring is here, and the little shop hit by the bullets stays in the cold winter.
焦虑、彷徨、无奈、不知所措……创业者们有比普通人更复杂的心情。
Anxiety, loss, helplessness, confusion... entrepreneurs have more complex than ordinary people in the mood.
我们找到七位武汉年轻人熟悉的实体店老板，无论是屹立二十余载的老店，还是新开不久的网红店，“疫情下的生存”是他们此刻的共同考题。
We found seven Wuhan young people familiar with the physical shop owners, whether standing for more than 20 years old shop, or the newly opened red shop, "survival under the epidemic" is their common test at the moment.
疫情开始时，大多数人都以为这场灾难一个月左右就会结束，平时忙于工作的人索性安慰自己就当放了个长假。
When the epidemic began, most people thought the disaster would be over in a month or so, and those who were busy with their work simply comforted themselves with a long vacation.
随着负面消息铺天盖地而来，大家根本静不下心来。
With so much negative news coming up, there was no peace of mind at all.
最严重的那段时间，视觉书屋主理人段成波还失眠过，直到八方支援来到武汉，心绪才慢慢稳定。
The most serious period of time, visual bookstore management into waves of insomnia, until the eighth support came to Wuhan, the mood slowly stabilized.
大年初一，视觉书屋老美院店外的中山路“尝试不看消息，然后调整自己的状态。
New Year's Day, visual bookshop outside the old courtyard store Zhongshan Road "try not to read the news, and then adjust their state.
再定时起床，吃饭，工作，慢慢忘记自己被‘关’了起来。
Get up regularly, eat, work, and slowly forget that they have been 'shut' up.
”很多人都和游心咖啡主理人月半老板一样，远离负面消息后，开始变得积极。
Many people, like the boss of Month and a half, who heads a roving coffee shop, are turning positive after distancing themselves from negative news.
年前心脏检查出负荷过大的月半老板，在被迫休息的这段时间里，发现静下来思考也何尝不是一件好事。
It's not such a bad thing to find yourself taking a break from a month and a half of an overloaded boss who was tested by the heart a year ago.
除了尽量安抚单独留汉的小伙伴外，月半老板还很担心他们的心理健康，长时间的居家生活，很容易造成昼夜颠倒，心神涣散。
In addition to trying to mollify their lone partner, the boss worries about their psychological well-being, their long stay-at-home life, which can easily lead to day-and-night reverses and distractions.
所以他开始做线上培训，定时把大家叫在一起，一方面培训理论知识，一方面让大家每天有事做，引导大家保持规律的作息与保有良好的精神状态。
So he began to do on-line training, regularly called people together, on the one hand, to train theoretical knowledge, on the one hand, let us do things every day, guide us to maintain regular work and maintain a good mental state.
游心咖啡馆的小伙伴们连锁店开得最多的“星期一”是受访者中心态最好的，她的小川料理和阿卡AK.Lab洋风韩国料理在武汉一共有6家店，“大家都知道做餐饮很辛苦，起早贪黑，也从来没有长假，所以我希望员工们这次可以好好休息。
"Monday," the most popular among chain stores, was the best of the bunch, with six stores in Wuhan -- "Everyone knows it's hard work, getting up early, getting up early, never taking long vacations, so I hope the employees get some rest this time.
”而她自己，毕业十年以来，这是第一次休息将近两个月。
"And herself, for the first time in almost two months since graduating from school.
被关在家的她每天忙着团菜，玩线上剧本杀，也学会了做剁椒鱼头、麻辣香锅……同样乐观的还有HK料理人的老板刘师傅，身为店里的大厨，“职业便利”让她可以好好准备每天的正餐，偶尔还会做些饮品甜点解馋。
Shut up at home every day she is busy dishes, play online script kill, also learned to do chopped pepper fish head, spicy hot pot... Also optimistic about the owner of HK cuisine, Liu Shifu, as the chef, "professional convenience" allows her to prepare daily meals, occasional dessert drinks greedy.
即便是物资匮乏时的早餐，她也会尽量吃得精致，咖啡或奶茶，团购的面包也要捣鼓得自认完美后再吃。
Even in times of scarcity, she will try to eat as delicately as possible, coffee or milk tea, and the bread will be tampered with until it is perfect.
刘师傅的早餐相比起来，家住金银潭的路物集老板克路就没有这么“幸运”，她的堂哥轻症，被治疗后痊愈，但大伯感染后病情一直反复，以前是空军的大伯现在骨瘦如柴，至今还在重症病房。
Liu's breakfast compared to the home of gold and silver pool owner Lu Lu is not so "lucky", her cousin light disease, after treatment, but his illness has been repeated after the uncle has been infected, the former uncle of the Air Force is now skinny, still in the intensive care unit.
一边思考如何拯救自己的店，因为亲人感染疫病，克路一边还要饱受新冠带来的精神折磨。
While thinking about how to save their shops, because relatives infected with the disease, Ke Lu side of the new crown of mental torture.
封城前回到了山东老家的徐刀刀同样每天忧心忡忡，她感觉昙华林店再开放要等到夏天了，樱花节和五一的旺季都错过了。
Xu Dao, who returned to her native Shandong province in front of the city, is also worried every day. She feels she is waiting until summer when Sakura Festival and the May Day season are missing.
除了位于昙华林的鲜花饼店和铜锣烧店，其实徐刀刀还有一家卖睡衣的淘宝店，以前三四天的物流，现在要半个月才能到，害她总被买家骂，纵使她现在有再多想法，也没办法，使不上劲。
In addition to the flower pancake shop and the gong shop that is located at Tam Hua Lin Xu Dao and a shop selling pajamas. The logistics of the past three or four days now take half a month to arrive.
“徐刀刀和她的铜锣烧”店面手绘“昙华林最牛逼的店也只是小店，抗风险能力很小。
"Xu knife and her copper gong burning" hand-painted shop "Tan Hua Lin the most bully shop is only small shop, anti-risk ability is very small.
我现在倒羡慕朝九晚五的上班族，如果现在有人找我做点其他赚钱的副业，我会马上答应。
I now envy nine-to-five office workers, and if anyone now turns to me for some other lucrative sideline, I'll say yes immediately.
”言语间，还是那个豪迈的徐刀刀。
"Words, or the heroic Xu knife.
做餐饮的人，每天都在猜测疫情后大家是会“报复消费”还是“不消费”。
Catering people, every day after the speculation that everyone will be "revenge consumption" or "do not consume."
徐刀刀知道她卖的鲜花饼和铜锣烧都是非刚需品，这次疫情，让她的店从茁壮成长的健康小宝宝直奔“死亡”而去，徐刀刀以前听到其他店倒闭时，觉得无关痛痒，这次才真的感同身受。
Xu knew that the flowers she sold and the gong burned were just necessities. This time, Xu felt no pain when she heard that other shops had failed.
随着封城的时间越来越久，大家都意识到这次疫情将是大多数生意人遇到过的最大的危机。
As the siege continued, everyone realized that this would be the biggest crisis most businessmen had ever faced.
游心咖啡馆开店以来，从没放过长假。
Ever since the cafe opened, it has never let go of long vacations.
去年7月和12月，他们新开了汉街店和无压力探索店，这两家店还在持续投入和调整阶段，突如其来的疫情，让公司的现金流捉襟见肘。
In July and December last year, they opened a new Hanjie store and a stress-free exploration store, both of which are continuing to invest and adjust. The sudden outbreak stretched the company's cash flow.
游心咖啡汉街湖畔店月半老板保守估计，自封城以来他们的亏损已超过50万，房租人工都是硬性的，让他欣慰的是万达对他们减免了房租。
Youxin Hanjie Lakeside Shop Boss conservatively estimated that they had lost more than half a million dollars since the self-proclaimed city, and that rental labor was hard, and he was pleased that Wanda had given them rent relief.
损失比较大的还有食材的浪费，原本计划春节时四家店正常营业，所以加倍制作了很多甜点，还库存了许多咖啡物料。
There was also a waste of raw materials. Four shops were scheduled to open during the Spring Festival, so many desserts were doubled and many coffee items were kept in stock.
决定关门后，他们就把所有饼干糖果挂耳包等都捐给了就近的中南医院，聊表寸心。
When they decided to close the door, they donated all the biscuits and candy earrings to the nearest south-central hospital.
“现在最大的问题是房租，人工，和复工后的启动资金。
"The biggest problems right now are rent, labor, and start-up capital once we get back to work.
”想到这些，月半老板只能无奈地挠头。
"Thinking of that, the boss had to scratch his head in frustration.
房租是架在大多数生意人脖子上的第一把刀，徐刀刀现在每天睁开眼就会想到自己在武汉有四个房租要交：两个店，一个办公室，一个住所。
The rent was the first knife to sit on the necks of most businessmen, and Xu's knife now opens his eyes every day thinking that he has four rents to pay in Wuhan: two shops, an office and a house.
到三月初，她的损失在7-10万，如果真的到五六月才完全恢复的话，损失估计会在 30万左右。
By early March, her losses were between 70,000 and 100,000, and if they did not fully recover in May or June, they were estimated at about 300,000.
徐刀刀没有去争取房租减免，一是因为她知道跟昙华林的老嫂子讲这些是不可能的，平时她们都只会想尽理由涨房租。
Xu did not ask for rent relief because she knew that it was impossible to talk to his old sister-in-law. Usually they just wanted to increase their rent for whatever reason they wanted.
二是因为她也不知道别人难不难。
Second, she doesn't know how difficult it is for others.
小川&阿卡的老板“星期一”说，餐饮刚性主要支出主要是房租和人员工资，他们每个月的亏损在50万左右。
Ritz & amp; amp; amp; amp; A & amp; A & amp; A & amp; A's boss says Monday that the company's main rigid food and beverage expenses are mainly rent and wages, and that it loses about 500,000 a month.
“星期一”呼吁有能力的房东主动减免，但不做道德绑架。
"Monday" called on the competent landlord to offer relief, but not to do moral kidnapping.
“很多房东都是商业地产，他们也有贷款要还，大家需换位思考，一刀切肯定是不行的。
"A lot of landlords are commercial real estate, they also have loans to pay back, we need to change thinking, one size does not fit all.
”甜阿姨私房菜泰兴里店对于甜阿姨私厨、路物集、HK料理人这些位于汉口老租界区的店，因为物业多半是私人的，跟房东交涉免租基本没有可能。
Auntie Sweet Private Restaurant Tai Hing Li Restaurant is located in Hankou's old concession area for sweet auntie chefs, road collections and HK housekeepers, as most properties are private and it is almost impossible to negotiate rent-free terms with landlords.
老板本身也是员工的小店，工作一停下来就是零收入。
The boss is also an employee's shop, and no income comes when work stops.
再加上还要继续支付的房租水电，压得让人喘不过气来。
Add to that the continued payment of rent, electricity and water, and the pressure is overwhelming.
路物集汉口店比起餐饮店，开书店的段成波和做珠宝设计的克路损失相对少些，毕竟没有食材损耗，前者两家店一个月的损失大约在七八万，后者两个店一个月的损失大约在两万。
Hankou Shop has less damage from opening a bookstore than from a restaurant, which loses about 780,000 a month, and a jewellery shop, which loses about 20,000 dollars a month, because it doesn't have to waste materials.
开店和打工不一样，做生意每天能看到进账，正常情况下，克路每个月会有四五万的营业额，停止营业后，她的现金流断掉，整个运作也就打乱了。
When business is shut down, her cash flow is cut off and the whole operation is disrupted. When she doesn't open a business, she sees her daily bills coming in and normally has a turnover of 450,000 a month.
路物集文华书城店打工的都是过年有钱，做生意的都是过年没钱。
Road collection Wenhua Shutcheng shop are all over the New Year rich, business is the New Year without money.
去年春节前，克路结完账后手中只剩几千元。
Before the Spring Festival last year, Kluger had only a few thousand yuan left in his hand.
因为珠宝行业非常压货，加之年前也备了很多货，等本是旺季的春节、情人节、三八妇女节、武汉的樱花节过后，再到夏天就是淡季了。
Because the jewelry industry is very low-pressure, plus a lot of goods prepared years ago, such as the busy Spring Festival, Valentine's Day, March 8, Wuhan Sakura Festival, and then summer is the low season.
克路另外还有一间民宿，可旅游业更是受到重创，所以解封后，她会考虑退掉民宿的房子。
Ke Lu has another residential accommodation, but the tourism industry has been particularly hard hit, so when unsealed, she will consider retreating residential housing.
采访时，克路透露她在支付宝的网商贷借了三万，这笔没有利息的借款可让她稍作喘息。
During the interview, Lu revealed that she borrowed 30, 000 dollars from pay-as-you-go Internet merchants, and that the interest-free loan would give her some respite.
不久前北京一家知名书店，向社会和他们的粉丝发出了 “求救信”，段成波觉得这是一种情怀营销，是对未来的透支……国内的书店群里，大家都在探讨着疫情后的自救。
Not long ago, a well-known bookstore in Beijing sent out "SOS letters" to the society and their fans. Duan Chengbo felt that it was a kind of emotional marketing, an overdraft of the future... Everyone in the domestic bookstore group is talking about self-help after the outbreak.
每个店都有不同的特点，能够走下去且活得很好的店，必须要有“内容力”“私域流量”“创造力”，这是段成波经营书店多年后的心得。
Every store has its own characteristics, can go down and live well shop, must have "content", "private domain flow" "creativity," this is a paragraph into the book store after years of learning.
视觉书屋创意天地店湖北之外，很多地方已经复工，他们的情况怎样呢？克路在广州的朋友告诉她，广州的珠宝市场虽然开始营业的，但档口都没有人，八个光谷广场那么大的地方现在空空如也，加工厂的工人也没有完全复工，生意没法展开。
Her friends in Guangzhou told her that although the jewelry market in Guangzhou was open, there was no one in the stalls, and the area the size of the eight Guanggu Piazza was now empty and the workers in the processing plant had not fully returned to work and business was not proceeding.
克路本觉得自己已经很惨了，但身边多得是更惨的人，“我爸是开搅拌站的，基建期就有两年，现在好不容易运作了，又遇到这个事，他仓库里的100多吨水泥都要过期了。
He thought he was miserable, but there were more people around him. "My dad started a blender and had an infrastructure period of two years.
一个月的亏损在20万左右，做下去，补不回来；不做，就是硬亏。
A month's loss of about 200,000, do it, can not make up for; do not do, is a hard deficit.
”克路还有一个开连锁咖啡店的朋友，仅香港路店一家分店，一个月就亏八万。
Mr Crowe also has a friend who runs a chain of coffee shops, losing 80,000 a month in a Hong Kong boutique alone.
甜阿姨和“星期一”也都表示，身边挺多朋友的店都快撑不下去了，一种是因为疫情之前的经营状况就不乐观，关闭是及时止损，还有一种是扩张过快，疫情后现金流彻底断掉。
Auntie Sweet and "Monday" also said that quite a lot of friends around the store will not continue, one is because the pre-epidemic business situation is not optimistic, closure is a timely stop, and another is too rapid expansion, the post-epidemic cash flow completely cut off.
以往人来人往的昙华林“昙华林的老板会在群里互吐苦水，大家像在比惨一样。
The former outcomer Hua Lin's boss spits out in the group as though they were miserable.
以前群里的消息都是‘到我店里喝酒啊’ ‘我新画了一幅画’，现在却是 ‘我打算把店盘出去’ ”。
The message from the previous group was, 'Come to my shop and drink,' I've painted a new painting, 'and now it's' I'm going to go out. '"
徐刀刀形容这种交流是流于表面的情感表达，并没有讨论该怎么办。
Xu described the exchange as a superficial expression of emotion and did not discuss what to do.
徐刀刀的好朋友大水人在重庆，徐刀刀羡慕他还能静下心画画健身，她却每天担心着各种问题。
Xu Dao's good friend Dashui in Chongqing, Xu Dao envied him for his quiet mind painting fitness, but she worried about a variety of problems every day.
她跟老员工和合伙人也都保持着默契，各自发圈点赞，也会聊些闲话，但真把“店的生存”摊到桌面谈，就冷场了。
She and the old staff and partners also maintain a tacit understanding, each issued a circle of praise, will chat some gossip, but really "shop survival" spread out on the desktop, the cold.
视觉书屋去年年底在美院店附近签下了一个400㎡的新店面，按照原计划，今年年初美院店本该搬家扩大，目前却只能等待。
The Visual Studio signed a new shop for 400 square meters near an art gallery at the end of last year. It was supposed to move and expand earlier this year, but now has to wait.
“我们是一家传统的主题书店，虽说有22年的历史，在武汉美术圈内有一定的知名度，当下电商的冲击，人们的购物方式的转变，如果我们还不做出一些变化，最终也会被淘汰。
"We are a traditional themed bookstore, although there is a 22-year history, in Wuhan art circles have a certain popularity, the impact of the current electric business, people's way of shopping, if we do not make some changes, will eventually be eliminated.
”即使没有疫情，段成波也一直在思考前路。
Even without the outbreak, Duan Chengbo has been thinking about the way forward.
视觉书屋老美院店同样有新店计划的还有甜阿姨和“星期一”，青年路的新店年前签了合同，本打算过完年装修的，另外还有一个面积更大的花园旗舰店计划，而小川料理和阿卡本来今年也有两家新店计划，无奈现在大家都只能把脚步放缓。
Auntie Sweet and Monday, the new store on Youth Road, signed a contract to complete the year-end renovation, and a larger flagship garden store, while Nakagawa and Akha had plans for two new stores this year, but now everyone has to slow down.
为了活下去，封城之后没多久，“星期一”就开始裁员了。
To survive, "Monday" began to lay off workers shortly after the closure of the city.
当然，裁的人大多是上班时间较短，且本身就想走的。
Of course, most layoffs are short-term jobs and want to go.
但那些员工家里比较困难的，工作时间比较长的，他们都会保证工资。
But those who work in difficult homes and work longer hours will be guaranteed a salary.
“星期一”还决定疫情结束后要给员工们上课，谈谈借贷和过度消费，她要教大家理理财。
Monday also decided to teach staff about borrowing and over-spending after the outbreak, and to teach people how to manage their finances.
阿卡AK.Lab洋风韩国料理疫情持续过久，一些回不了武汉的老员工纷纷表示疫情结束后要辞职回家，甜阿姨觉得这个情况对他们来说是很大的损失，因为培养一个优秀老员工真的是不容易，这比物质上的损失更为严重。
Akka Lab, South Korean cuisine has lasted too long, some old workers who can't go back to Wuhan have said they want to resign after the outbreak. Aunt Sweet feels this situation is a great loss for them, because it is not easy to train a good old staff, more serious than material losses.
此外，甜阿姨也表示如果能挺过这一关，开业第一件事就是让利，让生活里多些小惊喜。
In addition, Aunt Sweet also said that if you can survive this, the first thing to open is to let interest, so that life a little more pleasant surprise.
一直顺风顺水的徐刀刀则表示这次如果能活下来，会再次加强宣传，“我之前太固步自封，觉得不赔钱就行。
Xu Dao, who has been enjoying a comfortable life, said that if he survived, he would once again reinforce his propaganda. "I was too self-contained to lose money.
疫情结束后要回到刚刚创业的状态，一切归零。
When the epidemic is over, go back to business as it was, to zero.
”疫情前超人气的铜锣烧前些天有毕业后离开武汉的老顾客跟徐刀刀发消息说“不要等我再回武汉的时候就看不到你的店了”，这让她感慨万千，如果资金链真的断掉，她会弃车保帅，至少留一个店。
A few days before the epidemic's popular gong burned, old customers who had left Wuhan after graduation sent word to Xu Dao saying, "Don't wait for me to go back to Wuhan without seeing your shop.
凄凄惨惨戚戚中，也有人对未来仍然乐观，月半老板跟合作伙伴都认为，游心的核心竞争力不会改变，机会合适时，大家也许又能看到游心的新店。
Sad, some people still optimistic about the future, month and a half boss and partners believe that the core competitiveness of the game will not change, when the right opportunities, you may be able to see the heart of the new shop.
游心咖啡馆的音乐会better：这么久没去店里了，最想念的事？甜阿姨：因为店都是我亲手布置的，最近还在脑子里想哪里要换了，哪里要修。
I haven't been to the store for so long.Aunt Sugar: Because I've arranged them myself, and I've been thinking about where to change and where to fix them recently.
超想工作，超想去端盘子，超想和客人多聊几句。
I want to work very much, I want to bring some dishes, and I want to talk more with my guests.
徐刀刀：想和昙花林的老朋友聚会，想念黄老板的厨艺高超，想去他那蹭饭，喝大酒。
Xu Dao: Want to have a party with an old friend of Epiphyllum, miss boss Huang's excellent cooking skills, want to go there to eat and drink wine.
也想念昙华林的人来人往：打情骂俏的情侣、遛弯的大爷、织毛衣的嫂子、在墙角坐着小马扎晒太阳的老人、乱窜的小狗。
I also miss my buddies, my curmudgeon, my sister-in-law knitting, the old man sitting in the corner in the sun and the stray dog.
但这些美好久远得像上世纪的事。
But these things are as old as the last century.
月半老板：总是会想起游心青山滨江店定期举办的江滩音乐会，安静的长江边，美丽的夕阳下，小伙伴与客人喝着喜欢的咖啡，唱着动人的歌曲。
Month and a half Boss: I always think of the beach concerts held regularly by the Yongxin Qingshan Riverside Shop, the quiet Changjiang River, the beautiful sunset, the little friends and guests drink their favorite coffee, sing moving songs.
better：还有什么话想对大家说的吗？段成波：疫情中再次翻阅日本设计师黑川雅的《日本的八个审美意识》，书中提到 “一期一会”，作者这样解释：现在能够与这个人交流的瞬间，不会再重来。
Japanese designer Takahiro Uchikawa's "Eight Aesthetic Consciousness in Japan," written by Japanese designer Takahisa Kuroda, explains that the moment when you can communicate with this person will never happen again.
不要从长远的角度来看待与这个人的相见对自己有什么意义，对未来的自己是否有利，也不会觉得，反正以后还会再见，今天差不多就得了。
Don't take a long-term view of what meeting this person means to you, whether it is good for you in the future, or whether you will meet again in the future.
眼前，这个瞬间，与这个人的关系，就是值得珍惜的一切。
Now, this moment, with this person's relationship, is worth cherishing everything.
也是这次疫情里，我的最大感受！甜阿姨：我其实很担心疫情后，是否能保住老员工的收入和未来，毕竟服务行业人员薪水本来就不高，背后都是要养家糊口的。
Auntie Sweet: I'm really worried about the future and the income of our older workers, because the service sector is not well paid and has to support their families.
另一方面，80后的武汉人如果老了说经历过什么特殊时期，只怕就是这次了。
On the other hand, if the 80-year-old Wuhan people said that they have experienced any special period, I am afraid this is the only time.
星期一：《狮子山下》歌词里的，“我们大家在狮子山下相遇上，总算是欢笑多于唏嘘。
Monday: In the lyrics to Lion Rock, "We all met under Lion Mountain and laughed more than we sobbed.
人生不免崎岖，难以绝无挂虑。
Life is too rough to worry about.
” 希望解封后，能把店里去年没来得及拍的全家福补上。
"I hope I can make up the family picture I didn't have time to take last year," she said.
HK料理人店内餐食视觉书屋的线下活动-当我问到徐刀刀还有啥想跟大家说的时候，电话那头很大声回过来一句“我想问大家，还记得昙华林的徐刀刀吗”。
HK Restaurant Dining Off-Line Activities at Visual Studio - When I asked Xu if there was anything else I wanted to tell you about Xu Dao, the caller yelled back, "I want to ask you all, remember the Xu Hualin knife?"
我们当然记得，记得昙华林的大水和徐刀刀，记得粮道街的赵师傅和覃肥叔，记得兰陵路的三狗和蒋婆，记得蔡锷路的螺神和刘师傅，记得车站路的董厨和长子，记得花园道的丁香和啤酒公社，记得万松园的巴厘和夏式，记得大智路的十八号酒馆和UNCLEG，记得红钢城的小方和五仲，记得麒麟路的川妹和周记，记得菱角湖的亦山和Combo，记得鲁磨路的VOX和prison……值得放在心里的店太多太多，我们希望每一家承载着武汉清晨或深夜，落寞或欢愉，三餐四季或理想主义的店都能好好地经营下去，疫情过后，大家的心和胃都需要被好好慰藉。
We remember the Tai Shui and Xu Dao of Tam Hua Lin and remember Shifu Zhao and Uncle Tzu Chum. Remember the Three Dogs of Lanling Road and Master Jiang. Remember the Chef and Master Liu of Cai Ngok Road. Remember the cloves and beer commune in Linglun Road.
