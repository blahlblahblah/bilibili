我委特向李文亮医生表示沉痛哀悼并向其家属表示深切慰问！2019年12月30日下午，李文亮在同学群里提到，“华南水果海鲜市场确诊了7例SARS”“最新消息是冠状病毒感染确定了，正在进行病毒分型”。
On the afternoon of December 30, 2019, Li Wenliang told his classmate that seven cases of SARS had been confirmed in the fruit and seafood market in South China. The latest news is that the coronavirus infection has been confirmed and a virus classification is underway.
2020年1月1日，武汉警方发布通报称，一些网民在不经核实的情况下，在网上发布、转发不实信息，造成不良社会影响。
On January 1, 2020, Wuhan police issued a notice that some netizens in the Internet without verification, the dissemination of false information, resulting in adverse social impact.
公安机关经调查核实，传唤8名违法人员，并依法进行了处理。
The public security organs, after investigation and verification, summoned eight illegal personnel and dealt with them according to law.
两天后，李文亮收到警方的训诫书，警方认定“华南水果海鲜市场确诊了7例SARS”的言论，不属实。
Two days later, Li Wenliang received the police precepts, the police confirmed that "South China fruit and seafood market confirmed seven cases of SARS," the statement is not true.
1月12日，李文亮因发烧、咳嗽在武汉中心医院呼吸与重症医学科监护室接受隔离治疗。
January 12, Li Wenliang because of fever, cough in Wuhan Central Hospital breathing and intensive care unit received isolation treatment.
2020年2月1日，李文亮确诊新型冠状病毒肺炎。
On February 1, 2020, Li Wenliang confirmed a new coronavirus pneumonia.
他发表微博称，“今天核酸检测结果阳性，尘埃落定，终于确诊了”。
"Today the nucleic acid test results are positive, the dust settled, finally confirmed," he said in a microblog.
━━━━━接诊82岁眼疾患者后咳嗽发烧据李文亮自述，他是在接诊新冠病毒肺炎患者后，1月10号开始出现咳嗽症状，11号发热，12号住院。
2008-12-12 00: 00 Cough After 82 Years of Patients With Eye Disease Li Wenliang described himself as suffering from cough symptoms starting January 10, fever No. 11 and hospitalization No. 12 after receiving treatment for pneumonia with the new crown virus.
“那时候我还在想通报怎么还在说没有人传人，没有医护感染。
"At the time I was wondering why it was still being said that there was no human-to-human transmission and no medical attention to infection.
”在接受媒体采访时，李文亮介绍了自己感染肺炎的经过：“1月8日，我接诊了一位82岁的女性患者，她就诊的疾病是急性闭角型青光眼。
In an interview with the media, Li Wenliang described his history of pneumonia: "On January 8, I attended an 82-year-old female patient who was treated for acute angle-closure glaucoma.
我们平时接触患者也没有做特殊防护，病人来的时候也没发热，我就大意了。
We usually contact the patient also did not do special protection, when the patient came without fever, I was careless.
不过，第二天也就是9号，她就发烧了。
But the next day, on the 9th, she had a fever.
等她CT做完，我就高度怀疑她是病毒性肺炎。
By the time her CT is done, I have a strong suspicion that she has viral pneumonia.
因为CT显示，她的症状是“双肺磨玻璃样病变”，这是病毒性肺炎的表现。
Because CT showed that her symptoms were "double lung grinds glass-like lesions," which is a symptom of viral pneumonia.
而且，已经排除了常见病毒感染，支原体、衣原体感染等情况。
Moreover, common viral infections, mycoplasma and chlamydia infections have been eliminated.
不过，因为医院还没有用于检测确诊病人的试剂盒，当时并没有给她确诊。
However, she was not diagnosed at the time because the hospital did not have a kit for testing confirmed patients.
她1月8号住院，我1月10号就出现了咳嗽症状。
She was hospitalized on January 8th and I developed cough symptoms on January 10th.
随后我的病情也发展出现严重症状，并住进了重症监护室。
Then my condition developed serious symptoms and I was admitted to intensive care unit.
”1月24日起，李文亮就一直在武汉市中心医院呼吸内科重症监护室接受治疗。
Li Wenliang has been receiving treatment in the intensive care unit of the respiratory department of Wuhan Central Hospital since January 24.
“经过治疗最近又进行一次检测，我的核酸显示为阴性了，但目前仍然呼吸困难，无法活动。
"A recent test with treatment showed that my nucleic acid was negative, but I still have difficulty breathing and cannot move.
我的父母也在住院中。
My parents are also in the hospital.
”李文亮1月31日在微博上说。
"Li Wenliang said on a microblog on January 31.
李文亮说，在病房里，他也看到很多网友支持和鼓励，心情会轻松一些，谢谢大家的支持。
Li said that in the ward, he also saw a lot of netizens support and encouragement, the mood will be relaxed, thank you for your support.
“在此我想特别澄清，我没有被吊销执照，请大家放心，我一定积极配合治疗，争取早日出院。
"I would like to make it clear that my license has not been revoked. Please rest assured that I will actively cooperate with the treatment and seek early discharge from the hospital.
”2月1日，李文亮通过微博透露，其核酸检测结果阳性，“尘埃落定，终于确诊了。
On Feb. 1, Li Wenliang revealed through Weibo that his nucleic acid test was positive. "The dust settled and the diagnosis was made.
”在接受媒体采访时，被问及康复后有什么计划，李文亮说：“恢复以后还是要上一线，疫情还在扩散，不想当逃兵！至于疫情以后的事，还没想太多。
Asked in an interview with the media what plans he had for his recovery, he said: "There is still a front line to go after recovery, the epidemic is spreading and people don't want to be deserters.
”━━━━━曾因发布武汉疫情相关信息被武汉公安部门训诫李文亮在微博上回忆，12月30日，他看到一份病人的检测报告，检出SARS冠状病毒高置信度阳性指标。
2006-03-10 09: 23: 23 Li Wenliang, who was reprimanded on Weibo by Wuhan Public Security Bureau for releasing information about the outbreak, saw a patient's test report on December 30 and detected a positive indicator for the high-confidence level of the SARS coronavirus.
因为他的同学也都是临床医生，出于提醒同学注意防护的角度，他在群里发布了消息说“确诊了7例SARS”。
As his classmates were also clinicians, he posted a message in the group saying "seven cases of SARS were confirmed" as a precaution.
消息发出后，1月3日，公安局找到李文亮并签了训诫书。
After the news, January 3, the Public Security Bureau found Li Wenliang and signed the reprimand.
之后其一直正常工作。
It has since functioned normally.
据媒体报道，当时有3个医学交流群发布了相关的消息。
According to media reports, three medical communities released the news.
疫情初期，这些信息尚未引起足够的重视。
In the early stages of the epidemic, this information has not received sufficient attention.
1月1日，武汉警方发布通告：一些网民在不经核实的情况下，在网络上发布、转发不实信息，造成不良社会影响。
Wuhan police on January 1 issued a notice: some netizens in the network without verification, the dissemination of false information, resulting in adverse social impact.
公安机关经调查核实，已传唤8名违法人员，并依法进行处理。
After an investigation, the public security organs verified that 8 illegal personnel had been summoned and dealt with according to law.
1月28日，最高人民法院刊文对“8人传谣被处理”事件评论称：“如果机械地理解适用法律，我们的确可以认定，鉴于新型肺炎不是SARS，说武汉出现了SARS，属于编造不实信息，且该信息造成了社会秩序的混乱，符合法律规定的编造并传播虚假信息的行为，给予其训诫或行政处罚甚至刑事处罚。
"If we understand the applicable law mechanically, we can indeed conclude that the new pneumonia is not SARS, that Wuhan has SARS, that it is false information and that the information has caused disorder in the social order, that the fabrication and dissemination of false information in accordance with the provisions of the law is subject to disciplinary or administrative penalties or even criminal penalties.
”“但是，事实证明，尽管新型肺炎并不是SARS，但是信息发布者发布的内容，并非完全捏造。
"But although the new pneumonia is not SARS, what the publishers have published is not a complete fabrication," he said.
如果社会公众当时听信了这个‘谣言’，并且基于对SARS的恐慌而采取了佩戴口罩、严格消毒、避免再去野生动物市场等措施，这对我们今天更好地防控新型肺炎，可能是一件幸事。
If the public had listened to the rumour, and based on panic over SARS, measures such as wearing masks, strictly disinfecting, and avoiding going back to wildlife markets, it would have been a boon to us today to better control the new form of pneumonia.
”“只要信息基本属实，发布者、传播者主观上并无恶意，行为客观上并未造成严重的危害，我们对这样的‘虚假信息’理应保持宽容态度。
"As long as the information is basically true and the publisher or disseminator has no intention of causing serious harm objectively, we should be tolerant of such 'false information'.
”最高法表态1天后，1月29日武汉警方发布通报：2019年12月31日，武汉市卫健部门发布关于肺炎疫情的情况通报。
Wuhan police on January 29 announced that on December 31, 2019, Wuhan city health authorities issued a briefing on the outbreak of pneumonia.
随后，多名网民举报有人在网上传发不实信息。
Subsequently, several netizens reported that someone had sent false information on the Internet.
为查明情况，公安机关先后对8名行为人进行了调查、核实。
To clarify the situation, the public security organs have successively investigated and verified eight perpetrators.
根据调查情况，8人分别传发了“X医院已有多例SARS确诊病例”、“确诊了7例SARS”、“Y医院接收了一家三口从某洲回来的，然后就疑似非典了”等未经核实的信息。
According to the investigation, eight people sent unverified information such as "X Hospital has already had many confirmed cases of SARS," "Confirmed 7 cases of SARS," "Y Hospital has received a family of three people from a certain continent, and then suspected SARS," etc.
根据《中华人民共和国治安管理处罚法》的相关规定，因上述8人情节特别轻微，当时，公安机关分别进行了教育、批评，均未给予警告、罚款、拘留的处罚。
According to the relevant provisions of the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Public Security Administration, the eight above-mentioned persons were given special mild circumstances.
