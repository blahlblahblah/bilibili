澎湃新闻记者 邓雅菲 实习生 陈紫嘉“我经常想，如果以后我在电视上看到关于雷神山医院的新闻，我一定会特别骄傲、自豪。
Peng Pai journalist Deng Yafi intern Chen Zijia "I often think that if I watch the news on TV about Lei Shenshan Hospital in the future, I will be particularly proud.
我会和别人说，这栋楼是我装修的，这是我和同事们一起抢时间的地方，而且最后我们做到了，没有耽误那些需要这所医院的病人。
I would tell people that this building was decorated by me, that it was where my colleagues and I fought for time, and that we managed to do it without delaying those who needed it.
”2月8日，雷神山医院按时交付使用。
"On February 8, Raytheon Mountain Hospital was delivered on time.
装修技术管理人员邓毅，是雷神山医院众多建设者中的一员。
Renovation technical manager Deng Yi, is the Lei Shenshan Hospital many constructors among one.
1月25日，大年初一，火神山医院建设刚刚展开，武汉市新冠肺炎疫情防控指挥部又紧急召开调度会，决定在半个月之内再建一所雷神山医院。
On January 25, the first day of the Lunar New Year, the construction of the Mount Huoshen Hospital has just begun, Wuhan New Crown Pneumonia Prevention and Control Command urgently convened a meeting, decided to build a more within half a month Luishen Mountain Hospital.
6天时间里，雷神山医院的规划总建筑面积3次增加，从5万平方米增加到7.99万平方米，床位从1300张增加至1600张，总体规模超过2个火神山医院，但工期却与火神山相当，这背后饱含着千百普通人的艰苦付出。
Over a six-day period, the total planned floor area of Raytheon Hill Hospital has increased three times, from 50,000 to 79,900 square metres, from 1,300 to 1,600 beds. The total size of the hospital exceeds 2 Flaming Mountain hospitals, but the construction period is comparable to Mount Fire, which is full of the hard work of thousands of ordinary people.
2月3日，就职于湖北藤仓建材科技有限公司旗下百年家品牌的邓毅和同事们毅然接下“英雄帖”，支援武汉雷神山医院建设。
February 3, works in Hubei Fujiancang Building Materials Technology Co. Ltd. 100-year-old brand Deng Yi and his colleagues resolutely take over the "heroic post" to support the construction of Wuhan Lei Shenshan Hospital.
“雷神山医院的主体是活动板房，每一栋楼的主体完成之后，我和同事们要在3到5天内完成室内装修，我和团队成员共装修了3栋楼，最快3天就装修一栋。
"The main part of the Raytheon Hill Hospital is the movable slab room. After the main body of each building is completed, my colleagues and I will finish the interior decoration in 3 to 5 days.
”邓毅告诉澎湃新闻（www.thepaper.cn）。
Deng told the stormy news (www.thepper.cn).
邓毅坦言，自己从前做装修也抢工期，也曾通宵达旦地干，但从没像这次这样渴望完工。
Deng Yi admitted that he used to decorate the work period, also worked all night long, but never as eager to finish as this.
他还说，刚到武汉时也会害怕被感染，“直到有一次，我看到建设者们出工时排着一眼望不到头的队，当时很感慨，这个建设团队真大啊！既然大家都不怕，我也不怕。
He said he was afraid of infection when he first arrived in Wuhan, "until I saw builders lining up to look out of work and lamenting how big the construction team was.

本文图片均为受访者提供【邓毅的口述】吃饭、补觉的一个小时很奢侈每天早上，我们7点开工，但6点就要起床准备，因为住宿工棚的位置距离雷神山施工现场有将近40分钟的车程。
Each morning, we start work at 7 a.m., but we have to get up at 6: 00 to get up, because the bungalow is located nearly 40 minutes away from the construction site at Raytheon Hill.
住宿的工棚是临时征用的，其实就是活动板房里，所以环境相对比较艰苦。
Accommodation of the shed is a temporary requisition, in fact is the mobile board room, so the environment is relatively difficult.
不过，来之前我们有心理准备了，而且真正在工棚里睡觉的时间也不多。
But we were mentally prepared before we came, and we didn't really sleep much in the shed.
大家都知道必须按时交付医院意味着什么，时间就是生命，所有工人都在加班加点，我们每天回到工棚睡觉大概都是凌晨两三点，有时甚至需要通宵作业。
Everyone knew what it meant to have to be delivered to the hospital on time, that time was life, that all workers were working overtime, that we went to the shed to sleep about two or three in the morning, and that sometimes we had to work all night.
大家也不是铁人，但摆在我们面前的难题确实不小，施工量大而且时间紧张。
We are not iron man, but we face the problem is not small, construction volume and time constraints.
建筑工人在夜间施工。
Construction workers work at night.
我主要负责装修，涉及的工作种类比较多，包括水电工、木工、瓦匠等等。
I am mainly responsible for decoration, involving more types of work, including electricians, carpenters, masons and so on.
我们的工作是布线、布管道，让雷神山医院能够通水通电。
Our work is wiring, cloth pipes, so that Lui Shenshan Hospital can be connected to water and electricity.
这个工程量可不小，要知道，医院的每间病房都配有独立的洗浴间需要独立的冷热水系统，还有照明、排风和空气净化系统。
This is not a small amount of work, you know, every hospital ward is equipped with a separate bathroom needs a separate hot and cold water system, as well as lighting, ventilation and air purification system.
上面给我们的要求是3到5天装修完一栋，现在我们已经按时完成了3栋的室内装修了，最快的时候3天装完一栋。
The request above is three to five days to decorate one, now we have finished three indoor decoration on time, the fastest time three days to complete one.

我还要安排材料和技术工人的衔接，以及工人工作的分配。
I will also arrange the connection between the materials and the skilled workers, as well as the distribution of the workers' work.
我现在负责分配15到20个工人的工作，每天早上开早会分配每个人的工作，晚上还要开晚会做当天的工作总结，并且整理出第二天要做的工作。
I am now responsible for distributing the work of 15 to 20 workers, assigning everyone's work in the morning, having a party in the evening to sum up the day's work, and making arrangements for the work to be done the next day.
由于建筑材料的调配和衔接涉及的面比较宽，有的时候输送物料会延迟，有时候工序上还会出问题，比如我做到这一步了，但是上一步还没有完成。
Because of the wide range of materials involved, sometimes the delivery of materials will be delayed, and sometimes the process will go wrong, such as I have done this, but the last step has not been completed.
这种时候就需要等待和衔接，幸好，每个人都在尽职尽责完成自己的工作，所以这种情况还是比较少的。
It's a time to wait and connect, and thankfully, everyone is doing their job conscientiously, so it's still relatively rare.

还有一点和平时搞装修特别不同的是，因为工期实在太短，所以每个工种的工人都同时在操作，有时候大家挤在一起，转个身都要小心翼翼，生怕撞坏了其他人的工作进度。
There is also a special difference with the usual decoration, because the construction period is too short, so each kind of workers are operating at the same time, sometimes people crowded together, turn around carefully, so as not to crash the work of others.
我们以前也抢工期，也通宵，但从没有这么渴望早点完工。
We used to rush the deadline and stay up all night, but never so eager to finish it earlier.
为了保证体力，中午吃饭的一个小时，成了大家补觉的时间。
In order to ensure physical strength, lunch hour, has become the time to make up for sleep.
有时候看到睡得横七竖八的同事们一到时间就马上投入工作，真的很心疼他们，想想这一个小时真的是奢侈。
Sometimes I see colleagues who fall asleep at random and get to work as soon as the time comes. I really love them and think of this hour as a luxury.
来自五湖四海的“战友”，或许再也不会相聚在雷神山的这几天，其实很享受吃饭和睡觉前的短短一段时间。
From all over the world, "comrade-in-arms" may never meet again in the days of Raytheon Mountain, in fact enjoy eating and sleeping just a short time.
不仅是因为可以休息，更是因为可以和工人们聊聊天。
Not only because you can rest, but also because you can talk to the workers.
我们是一群来自五湖四海的建设者，大家因为雷神山医院聚在一起，一起施工、一起吃饭，一起聊自己家乡有意思的事情。
We are a group of construction workers from all over the world, because of Lei Shenshan Hospital get together, work together, eat together, chat with their hometown interesting things.
可能我们几个人白天在工地上还会因为施工衔接的问题“急个眼”，但坐下来聊几句，就什么都过去了。
Perhaps several of us on the construction site during the day because of construction problems "quick eye," but sat down to chat a few words, everything passed.
我把它叫做“革命友谊”，我们不像军人那么威风，但我觉得也是“战友”。
I call it "revolutionary friendship." We're not like soldiers, but I think we're "comrades-in-arms."
每天工地上的任务结束，我们会在微信群里聊天，除了相互交流工程进度和工作经验，更多的还是开开玩笑、讲讲段子，毕竟，这些也是让我们坚持下去的一股力量。
At the end of the day, we would chat in a group of micro-letters. Apart from sharing the progress of the project and our work experience, we would like to make jokes and talk about some passages.
说实话，在雷神山医院赶工的这几天，和那些工人们认识的时间并不长，真正要建立起非常深厚的友谊也很困难。
To tell the truth, in the days when Lei Shenshan Hospital was working, and those workers did not know each other for a long time, it is difficult to really build a very deep friendship.
但是和他们并肩作战的这段时间，我肯定永远不会忘记。
But I will never forget the time that I fought alongside them.
大家都说，完工之后，我们应该庆祝一下，但是在这个特殊时期，聚会肯定不允许的。
Everyone said that we should celebrate the completion of our work, but at this special time, the party was definitely not allowed.
这是小小的遗憾，因为下一次要见这些“战友”们，不知道会是什么时候，也许，再也没机会相聚了吧。
This is a small regret, because the next time I want to see these "comrade-in-arms," I do not know when, perhaps, never get together again.

每天最开心的是告诉孩子：我很安全其实在来到武汉之前，我也想过我可能会被感染，我心里也感到害怕。
Every day the happiest thing is to tell children: I am very safe in fact, before I came to Wuhan, I also thought that I might be infected, my heart is also afraid.
但是，我在电视上看到有人正月初一、初二就开始工作，我就受到了鼓舞。
But when I saw someone on TV starting work on the first two days of the first month, I was encouraged.
我看到那么多人都为了这个疫情在工作，想想大家都没有害怕，那我还怕什么呢？工人在雷神山医院施工。
I see so many people working on this epidemic, think that no one is afraid, then what am I afraid of? Workers at Raytheon Hill Hospital construction.
最近老是听到“逆行者”这个词，我不敢说“逆行者”有多伟大，我只是觉得我们做的每一个决定都要对得起家里人。
I can't say how great the Inverter is. I just feel that every decision we make should be worthy of our family.
我的家人一开始本来是反对我来的。
My family was against me at first.
父母对我说：“武汉那边疫情挺严重的，不要过去，人家说逃离武汉还来不及，你怎么还往武汉跑！”我就告诉他们，“很多人都在为疫情尽自己的一份力，我也想做些什么。
My parents said to me: "Wuhan side of the epidemic quite serious, do not pass, people said that it is not enough to flee Wuhan, you how to run to Wuhan!" I told them, "a lot of people are doing their part for the epidemic, I would like to do something.
”后来他们理解并支持我了，临走前，妻子还千叮咛万嘱咐，要注意自身安全，一定做好防护。
"Later, they understood and supported me, and before leaving, the wife could have spoken words, taking care of her own safety and protection.
我9岁的孩子特别舍不得我走，每天他都会发信息问我：“怎么样老爸？还好吗？什么时候回家？”然后，我每天最开心也是最踏实的时候，就是告诉孩子和家人，“我很安全”。
My 9-year-old is loath to let me go. Every day he sends me a message saying, "How's Dad? How's he? When I get home?" And then, the happiest and most sure time of day, I tell my children and family, "I'm safe."
在这样特殊的地方工作，不知道为什么，我变得特别想家，特别想念父母、妻子和孩子，不过，我没有和他们说太多，因为怕他们会担心。
Somehow, working in such a special place, I became so homesick that I missed my parents, my wife and my children, but I didn't say much to them because I feared they would worry.
我经常想，如果以后我在电视上看到关于雷神山医院的新闻，我一定会特别骄傲，特别自豪。
I often think that if I watch the news about Raytheon Hill Hospital on TV in the future, I will be especially proud and proud.
我会和别人说，那是我和同事们一起抢时间的地方，而且最后我们做到了，没有耽误那些需要这所医院的病人。
I'll tell people that's where I compete with my colleagues for time, and in the end we made it without delaying the patients who needed it.
