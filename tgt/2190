在这个特殊时期，只有停下来，才能渡过难关。
At this particular time, you have to stop to get through this.

But the hospital couldn't stop.
武汉市有61家医疗机构设发热门诊，所有社区卫生服务中心都有发热诊室，可开展发热病人的筛查和鉴别诊断。
There are 61 medical institutions in Wuhan with fever clinics, and all community health service centres have hot rooms for screening and differential diagnosis of febrile patients.

众多发热病人涌入医院彻夜排队，成为潜在传染源。

At the end of January, the city of Wuhan requisitioned 24 general hospitals in three batches on the basis of two earlier designated hospitals and 61 fever clinics to temporarily convert them into fever hospitals, taking into account the basic requirements of infectious disease control institutions.
床位还是不够，加上最初缺少试剂盒和检测速度慢，不少患者没来得及确诊就去世了。
The lack of beds, coupled with the initial lack of kits and slow detection, caused many patients to die before they could be diagnosed.
1月24日、25日两天，武汉市决定参照北京小汤山医院模式，建造武汉火神山和雷神山医院，以加大救治患者力度。

Together, the two hospitals provide about 2,600 beds.
1月27日，时任武汉市委书记马国强在新闻发布会上给出一组数据：自疫情发生以来，武汉发热门诊量逐日增多，往年这个季节，全市发热门诊量每天大体在3000例左右，而在过去几天里，高峰时段到发热门诊就诊的人数超过15000人次，在接诊量瞬时增加的情况下，发热门诊确实是在超负荷运转，出现了大量人员排队问题。
Wuhan fever clinics have increased daily since the outbreak began, with more than 15,000 visits a day in the past few days, and the number of visits to hot clinics during the past few days has been rising rapidly.

In a recent interview with the Beijing News, Chen Guohua, vice-president of Wuhan First Hospital, said that starting with supplies was the biggest headache.
“那几天晚上我从医院出来，感觉非常焦虑、无助，也心疼医务人员。
"I came out of the hospital the other night feeling very anxious, helpless and heartbroken.
他们每天十几个小时在这里工作，还不能回家，我作为管理者，连自己员工的生命安全都保证不了，我怎么跟他们交代？”大年三十晚上，陈国华吃完盒饭，就跟大家讨论还有多少口罩、多少防护服，还能维持多少天。
They work here for more than ten hours a day and can't go home yet. As a manager, I can't guarantee the lives of my own employees.
他每天不停地给指挥部打电话，从社会各种渠道去搞防护服、口罩，也发起爱心募捐。
Every day he calls the headquarters, from all kinds of social channels to get protective clothing, masks, but also launched a charitable fund-raising.
防护物资稀缺，是武汉各家医院面临的窘境。
The scarcity of protective materials is an embarrassment for Wuhan hospitals.
有医务人员表示，穿上防护服就不敢脱，脱了可能就没有了。
Medical personnel said that wearing protective clothing dare not take off, it may not be.
一旦穿上，意味着一直到全天工作忙完，都裹在防护服里透不过气。
Once worn, it means you can't breathe in a suit until the day's work is done.
医护人员感染的风险也在加大。
Health-care workers are also at increased risk of infection.
1月21日凌晨，武汉市卫健委首次通报，全市15名医务人员确诊，另有1名疑似病例。
In the early morning of January 21, Wuhan city health committee for the first time, the whole city 15 medical staff confirmed, and a suspected case.

来不及等政府调配，不少医院在网上发起爱心募捐。
Too late to wait for the government to deploy, many hospitals on the Internet launched a charity fund-raising.

这之前，武汉防控疫情的方略，包括城市的防控措施、医疗救治能力、对“四类人员”的排查和收治等，数次受到批评。
Wuhan has been criticized on several occasions for its strategy of preventing and controlling the disease, including measures to prevent and control the disease, medical treatment capacity, and screening and treatment of "four categories of personnel."
国家卫健委医政医管局官员曾表示，武汉疫情持续时间比较长，由于防控措施没有及时到位，很多社区病例没有得到及时救治。
Officials of the National Health Care and Administration Hospital Authority have said that Wuhan epidemic duration is relatively long, because the prevention and control measures did not arrive in time, many community cases were not treated in time.

Severe cases averaged 9.84 days from onset to hospitalization, with 10 days missing out on the best time to wait for the progression from mild to severe.
中央指导组副组长、中央政法委秘书长陈一新曾指出，武汉在疫情防控中对感染者底数还没有完全摸清，蔓延扩散的规模也没有较为精准的估计预测。
The vice-chairman of the Central Steering Group, Chen Xinxin, secretary-general of the Central Political Science and Law Commission, has pointed out that Wuhan has not yet fully understood the number of infected persons in the epidemic prevention and control, and there is no accurate estimate of the scale of the spread of the epidemic.

Though the city was declared "closed" as early as January 23, Wuhan residents mentioned that more than 20 days later, crowds were still visible in the streets and supermarkets, lining up for shopping.
湖北新书记应勇将“阻隔”列为和“救治”并重的关键环节之后，武汉宣布实施更严格的小区封闭管理。
After Hubei new secretary Yingyong listed "barrier" and "rescue" as both the key link, Wuhan announced the implementation of more stringent closed zone management.
叶青看到，武汉的社区除了特定人员，都禁止出入，大家也不能在小区散步，一天比一天严。
Ye Qing saw that Wuhan community in addition to specific personnel, are banned from entering and leaving, we can not walk in the community, day by day more stringent.
原来，他们可以去超市采购，2月15日开始，只能通过电商配送，物品送到后自己下楼取。
Originally, they can go to the supermarket to purchase, February 15, can only be delivered through electrical distribution, goods sent to their own downstairs to pick up.
王忠林还提出，武汉要实现“五个百分之百”——“确诊患者百分之百应收尽收、疑似患者百分之百核酸检测、发热病人百分之百进行检测、密切接触者百分之百隔离、小区村庄百分之百实行24小时封闭管理”，坚决遏制疫情扩散蔓延。
Wang also proposed that Wuhan should achieve "five hundred percent" - "100 percent receivable from confirmed patients, 100 percent nucleic acid testing of suspected patients, 100 percent testing of fever patients, 100 percent isolation of close contacts and 100 percent 24-hour closed management of small villages" to resolutely curb the spread of the epidemic.
武汉还通过提拔与问责，不断调整“战将”队伍。
Wuhan also through promotion and accountability, constantly adjust the "General" team.
截至2月21日，武汉已火线提拔干部20名、火线发展党员34人；纪检监察机关共查处问题385个、问责处理620人，涉局级干部6人、处级干部127人。
