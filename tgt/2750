尽管日本内阁官房长官菅义伟上月曾表示，通过政府和民间合作，日本3月的口罩产量将提升至“每月超过6亿只的规模”，但当时就已有人质疑，即使确保口罩产量每周超过1亿只，也“完全不足以消除缺货”。
Although Japan's chief cabinet secretary, Naoto Kan, said last month that through government-private partnerships, production of masks in March would rise to "more than 600 million a month," there was already scepticism that ensuring more than 100 million masks a week would be "simply not enough to eliminate shortages."
日本原本就是口罩消费大国。
Japan was originally a big mask consumer.
《日本经济新闻》2月27日援引日本经济产业省的数据，2000年前后，日本“花粉症”患者突然增多，对口罩需求量急速增长。
Japan's pollen crop surged around 2000 as demand for face masks soared, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) was quoted as saying.
到2018年，日本年消耗口罩55.38亿只。

而日本市面上的口罩有70%是中国生产的，有20%在日本生产，还有10%来自泰国、缅甸等地。
Seventy percent of Japan's masks are made in China, 20 percent in Japan and 10 percent in Thailand and Burma.
日本首相安倍晋三已在2月27日呼吁国内主要厂商增产口罩，并表示“如果有剩余，将由国家负责，作为储备物资”。
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has called on major domestic manufacturers on February 27 to increase production of masks, saying "if there is any surplus, it will be the responsibility of the state as a reserve."
就连电子电器生产商夏普都已应政府要求开始生产口罩，预计最早将在3月中旬启动生产，日产15万个。

据共同社3月2日报道，由护理职员等组成的日本护理行业工会当天称，如今近两成护理企业的口罩都“已经用完”。

In early February, the 30-setter mask sold for 7,800 yen (504 yuan) on the Japanese Amazon, more than 10 times the usual price.
口罩缺货的现状为卫生纸的“抢购潮”埋下了种子。
The current shortage of face masks for the toilet paper "rush" sown the seeds.
上周，日本的社交媒体上开始流传这样的消息，称由于卫生纸和口罩使用的是相同的材料，卫生纸的产地是中国，因此卫生纸和纸类制品都会出现短缺，最好提前购买。
Last week, social media outlets in Japan began circulating news that toilet paper and face masks were made of the same material and that toilet paper was made in China. As a result, there would be shortages of toilet paper and paper products.
来源：推特尽管日本家庭纸工业会和经济产业省都已出面辟谣，澄清日本国内卫生纸和口罩使用的不是同一种原料，且98%为日本制造，但仍无法阻止一些不明就里的消费者“血洗”超市货架。
www.youtheme.cn Although both the Japan Household Paper Industry Association and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry have spoken out to clarify that Japanese toilet paper and masks do not use the same raw material and that 98 per cent are made in Japan, they are still unable to stop unidentified consumers from washing supermarket shelves.
这股“抢购潮”也使得日本一些卫生纸的出货价格大幅上涨。
The rush has also pushed up the price of some Japanese toilet paper shipments.
日经新闻援引数据分析公司Keywalker的数据称，以日本亚马逊上销售的12卷1提卫生纸为例，2月17日的价格为497日元（约合人民币32元），28日就上涨至3500日元（约合人民币226元），是原来的7倍。
On Feb. 17, 497 yen, or about 32 yuan, went up to 3,500 yen (226 yuan), a seven-fold increase, according to data analyst Keywalker of the Nikkei news agency.

The price of paper towels has also risen, some as much as 36 times that of 10 days ago.
在日本一些跳蚤市场APP和拍卖网站上，12卷1提的卫生纸也接连拍出1500日元（约合人民币97元）的高价。
At some flea market APPs and auction sites in Japan, 12-volume 1 toilet paper sold for 1,500 yen (97 yuan) in succession.
对此，首相安倍晋三在2月29日的记者会上已呼吁民众“冷静购买”，强调卫生纸供应量充足，缺货为“不实谣言”。
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, speaking at a news conference on Feb. 29, has called for "calm buying," stressing that toilet paper is in sufficient supply and that stock-outs are "false rumours."
日本家庭纸工业会也已表示，产能并无问题，包括造纸公司在内均库存充足。
The Japan Household Paper Industry Association has also said there is no problem with capacity, including paper companies are well stocked.
不过，尽管日本的纸类制品供应充足，但在食品供应方面还是可能会出现一定波动。
However, although there is a sufficient supply of paper products in Japan, there are likely to be some fluctuations in the availability of food.
日本农林水产省发布的最新统计显示，2月上半月，日本的中国产蔬菜进口量同比减少了六成，卷心菜、大蒜、洋葱等品类大幅下滑。
In the first half of February, imports of vegetables from China fell 60 percent year on year, while cabbage, garlic and onions fell sharply, according to the latest statistics released by Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.
来源：日本经济新闻据悉，在日本蔬菜的国内流通量中，约两成依赖进口，中国产占其中一半。
China accounts for half of Japan's domestic market for vegetables, about 20 percent of which is imported, the Japan Economic News said.
其中，大蒜的六成、生姜的三成、洋葱的两成为中国产，对中国的依赖度很高。
Of these, 60% garlic, 30% ginger, and 2 onions are made in China and depend heavily on China.
上月，受疫情影响，部分中国产蔬菜已开始在日本涨价。
Last month, affected by the outbreak, some Chinese-made vegetables have begun to rise in Japan.
不过，由于暖冬使得日本国产蔬菜丰收，中国产蔬菜的供应短缺和价格上涨等影响尚未波及餐桌，受影响的主要是餐饮业。
But thanks to a bumper harvest of Japanese-made vegetables from the warm winter, shortages of vegetables from China and rising prices have not yet spread to tables, mainly in the catering industry.
但若进口持续减少导致日本国产需求提高，部分蔬菜的市场价格也有可能上涨。
But market prices for some vegetables are also likely to rise if continued import cuts lead to higher domestic demand in Japan.
与此同时，受疫情扩大导致学校一律停课影响，日本面向学校供餐的食材如鲜奶等则正在出现富余。
At the same time, school feeding materials, such as fresh milk, are emerging as a result of the spread of the epidemic, which is affecting schools across the board.
农林水产省已呼吁民众积极消费牛奶，并计划将部分富余的牛奶转用于黄油与奶酪加工，避免浪费。
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has called for active consumption of milk and plans to divert part of the surplus milk to butter and cheese processing in order to avoid waste.
农林水产大臣江藤拓表示，“若影响长期化，必须考虑某种支援措施（为农户提供支持）。
"If the impact is long-term, some kind of support measures [to support farmers] must be considered," said Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Jiang Futo.
