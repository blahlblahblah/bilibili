根据1月31日湖北省疫情新闻发布会，截至30日24时，武汉地区共有6万余名医务工作者参与救治；共有42支医疗队支援武汉，医护人员4599人。
According to a press conference on the situation in Hubei Province on January 31, as of 2400 hours on January 30, more than 60,000 medical workers had been treated in Wuhan, with 42 medical teams supporting Wuhan, with 4,599 medical personnel.
武汉123车队志愿者司机封城之后的武汉，交通系统停运，很多医护人员只能步行或骑车上班，一线医护的防控物资供应也非常紧张，不忍看到抗疫斗士的艰辛，这个城市里最普通的市民行动了起来。
Wuhan, where the transportation system was shut down after 123 volunteer drivers were shut down, many medical workers had to walk or ride bicycles to work. The supply of first-line medical supplies was also tight.
平时的工人、学生、白领、做小生意的，顶着瘟疫蔓延的压力，自发成为了车队志愿者：免费接送医护人员上下班；或者想方设法地拉来紧缺物资，送到一线医院、社区。
peacetime workers, students, white-collar workers, small businesses, in the face of the spread of the epidemic, spontaneously become convoy volunteers: free transport to and from work; or find ways to pull scarce supplies to first-line hospitals, communities.
运送物资，武汉青山区车队志愿者何景林供图志愿者们的防护装备非常基础，有时忙起来，从早到晚连轴转，没有人收取分文报酬。
Transport materials, Wuhan Qingshan team volunteers He Jinglin map volunteers for the very basic protective equipment, sometimes busy, from morning to night, no one received a penny reward.
一条通过武汉的读者们了解到这些人，最早我们联系上武汉123车队的黄晓民队长，和武汉青山区志愿者车队，他们又推荐了身边印象深刻的志愿者们，“有个90后的小伙子，到处都看到他的身影”，“你一定要好好采访下搞物资的老武，虽然只认识几天，我是真佩服他……”约访这些志愿者十分困难，因为他们大部分时候在路上，结束工作经常是夜晚，有时电话采访了一会，他们就抱歉地说，又要去接医护人员或者送物资了。
The first time we contacted Captain Huang Xiaomin of Wuhan 123 and the Wuhan Qingshan Volunteer Team, they recommended the impressive volunteers around us. "I really admire him even though he's only known for a few days."
车队志愿者拍摄的“武汉加油”一位车队的志愿者说，“晚上接到了一个爷爷，72岁，军医返聘回社区医院，他早上走两个小时的路过江上班。
"In the evening, a grandfather, 72, was rehired back to the community hospital, and he walked two hours in the morning to work on the river," said a volunteer in the convoy, "Come on, Wuhan.
他说对打赢这场仗很有信心，他不怕。
He said he was confident of winning the battle and he was not afraid.
所以我也不怕。
So I'm not afraid.
回家路上看到亮了灯，武汉加油。
On the way home saw the lights, Wuhan refueling.
”撰文倪蒹葭车队队长黄晓民接了一位刚值完24小时班的护士“我们每天接送约200名医护上下班”黄晓民 38岁职业：商业地产 市场推广疫情时期：武汉“123救援车队”队长1月23号武汉封城之后，我组建了一支123救援车队。
Huang Xiaomin, the team leader of the newly released 24-hour team, took over a 24-hour nurses "we transport about 200 medical workers to and from work every day" profession: commercial real estate market promotion era: Wuhan 123 rescue team captain January 23 after the closure of Wuhan, I formed a 123 rescue car convoy.
因为现在我唯一能做的就是开车送医护人员上下班了。
Because the only thing I can do right now is drive the paramedics to and from work.
从公司到我家，会路过4家医院，封城前几天，我就经常看到有一些医护人员下夜班后拦车挺困难的。
From the company to my home, will pass four hospitals, the days before the closure of the city, I often see some medical staff after the night parking difficult.
当时我想其实我可以顺一脚。
I thought I could just kick the bucket.
黄晓民1月23号手写的接送牌子23号这天，武汉的交通系统停运，我很快想到他们要怎么上班？当晚就在微信上建了一个“武汉医生出行互助群”，找同事同学一起做司机志愿者，然后越来越多陌生人加入。
On January 23, 2007, Wuhan's transportation system was shut down, and I quickly thought about how they would go to work. That night, I set up a group of Wuhan doctors traveling together to help each other.
123车队的女孩志愿者司机现在车队已经有90多个司机，最年轻的是97年出生的小伙子，1/10是女司机。
Girls in motorcades now have more than 90 drivers in the convoy, the youngest being a young man born in 1997 and one in 10 being a female driver.
我们每天接送约200名医护上下班。
We take about 200 people to and from work every day.
取名”123车队”是因为封城的日期，也因为“1、2、3！”像一个开始行动的信号，速度比较快。
The name "123" is due to the date of closure, but also because "1, 2, 3!" like a signal to start action, faster.
后来我们发现和武汉话的“管得宽”挺谐音。
Later we found that the "wide pipe" with Wuhan dialect quite harmonic.
23号夜里我就接了一单，一开始没有帽子和护目镜，我戴上泳帽泳镜上阵了，后来一个年轻护士送了我防溅面罩。
On the night of the 23rd I picked up a sheet, without a hat and goggles at first. I put on my swimming-cap goggles, and then a young nurse gave me a splash mask.
好在我的微信有1000多好友，朋友圈发了之后，信息就传递出去了，来自全国的志愿者给我寄来一些防护服、口罩，还有武汉一间小便利店，他们进到了84消毒液的货，专门为我们留了两箱。
Fortunately, I have more than 1000 friends, friends after the circulation, the message was passed on, volunteers from all over the country sent me some protective clothing, masks, and a small Wuhan convenience store, they entered the 84 disinfectant goods, and reserved two boxes for us.
我们可以说是“开局一台车，装备全靠捡。
We can say that "the start of a car, equipment is all up to pick up.
”我们每人每天接3-5单，我最多的一天接了10单，早上6点多出门，晚上7点多回到家。
We received three to five orders per person per day, and I got 10 on most days, going out at 6am and coming home at 7pm.
一般都是带些干粮在车上吃，不敢多喝水，上厕所很不方便。
Generally is to take some dry food in the car to eat, dare not drink more water, the toilet is very inconvenient.
一位62岁被返聘的老医生告诉我，在我们车队接送之前，他要骑2小时15分钟的自行车上班。
A 62-year-old doctor who had been rehired told me that he had to ride a two-hour, 15-minute bike to work before our motorcade picked it up.
很多护士其实都是95后的孩子，一个96年在ICU值班的护士，早上7点钟下夜班，上了我的车就睡着了，幸亏我知道她住在什么地方。
Many nurses are actually '95,' a 96-year-old nurse on duty at ICU, who works night shifts at 7 a.m., goes to sleep in my car, and happily knows where she lives.
一位医生请我们去接他的父亲，他父亲也是医生，他们要去不同的医院服务，他没法照顾到父亲上班。
A doctor asked us to pick up his father, who was also a doctor. They had to go to different hospitals and he couldn't take care of his father.
微信群中拒绝收取报酬为了防护，我们要求医护和司机尽量少交谈，而且大家都是陌生人，车上总是很安静。
In order to protect ourselves, we asked the doctor and the driver to talk as little as possible. Also, everyone was a stranger and the car was always quiet.
我等红灯的时候会跟他们讲一下话。
I'll talk to them when I'm waiting for a red light.
我问过一个护士等疫情过去，她最想干吗？她说想好好喝口水，再睡48个小时。
I asked a nurse what she wanted to do with the outbreak, and she said she wanted a good drink and 48 hours of sleep.
一位年轻的协和医院护士，她也不是属于呼吸科、感染科，但她说等火神山、雷神山医院建好，她要主动请缨过去前线。
A young Concorde hospital nurse, she is not part of the respiratory department, infection department, but she said that when the fire god mountain, Lei Shenshan hospital has been built, she will volunteer to go to the front.
很多医生护士下车的时候，直接丢下100块现金，或者微信上发红包，我们都是不收的，有时候我还会倒给他们红包。
Many doctors and nurses get out of their car and drop a hundred dollars in cash or a red envelope. We don't charge for them, and sometimes I give them red envelopes.
我的太太在封城前，就带了1岁多的孩子回黄石老家过年。
My wife took her 1-year-old child back to her hometown of Huang Shi to celebrate the New Year.
我微信告诉她想要做车队，她先是沉默了几分钟。
When I told her she wanted to be in the convoy, she was silent for a few minutes.
然后我就给她讲了很多医护人员的状况，工作了一夜还要等班车，而且大医院才有班车，社区卫生服务中心没有……后来她就给我回：你去吧，保护好自己。
Then I told her a lot about the health care workers, waiting for the bus after a night work, and the big hospital bus, the community health service center did not... Later she gave me back: You go, protect yourself.
123车队志愿者有些司机是瞒着太太出来的，我的同学让我发朋友圈千万不要提到他，他是跟太太说是出来打麻将的，麻将搭子都很健康，或者说去钓鱼。
My classmates told me not to mention him. He told his wife that he was coming out to play Mahjong, and that the mahjong players were very healthy, or go fishing.
昨天有一个单，是要从武汉八医院去江夏，全程30公里，刚看到我还担心这个单没人接，但很快就有司机说：没人去，我去！我们群除了司机，还有20个后勤志愿者，他们每天搜集医护和司机的出行信息，协调物资，想办法把捐助的物资送进来，经常从早上忙到凌晨一两点。
Yesterday, there was a single, from Wuhan eight hospitals to Jiangxia, the whole journey 30 kilometers, just saw I was still worried that no one answered, but soon a driver said: Nobody, I will!
志愿者拿着车队队标我现在和父母住在一起，家里就是一个物资中转点，我们收到了捐助的300个口罩，300件防护服，但网友募捐的1000个护目镜还卡在路上，我是给志愿者分发物资的人，检查好他们的3证1单（身份证、驾驶证、行驶证、保险单），就发物资。
We received 300 face masks and 300 protective clothing, but the donation of 1,000 goggles got stuck on the road. I was the one who distributed the supplies to the volunteers, checked their 3 cards (ID card, driver's license, travel permit, insurance policy) and distributed the materials.
每个人戴着口罩，互相也不认得，大家都很少话但动作迅速。
Everyone wore masks and did not recognize each other. Everybody spoke little but acted quickly.
朋友还为车队设计了队标，后勤志愿者打印好，大家分头去取，贴在车子挡风玻璃下方，交警看到我们的标志，就会放行。
Friends also designed the team logo for the convoy, logistics volunteers printed out, everyone to pick up, paste in the car under the windshield, the traffic police will see our logo, will release.
我们身边的故事就更多了，有一对新婚夫妻，才装修好的婚房就在后湖中心医院附近的小区，他们把新房免费给医护人员住，连一点押金都不肯收，这个事我觉得自己都做不到。
There are many more stories around us. A newly-wed couple with a decorated wedding room in the neighborhood near Houhu Central Hospital have given their new homes free of charge to medical staff without even receiving a deposit, something I don't think I can do.
黄晓民的朋友圈为了要通风，我们的车窗一直开着，武汉清晨特别冷，经常是零下1℃，而且司机都穿上防护服和手套，很容易流汗，所以我们20%的司机现在都有感冒的症状，我也开始咳嗽了。
The windows of our cars are always open for ventilation. Wuhan is very cold in the morning, often below -1oC, and drivers wear protective clothing and gloves and sweat easily.
28号是疫情爆发期，武汉新增了800例确诊，我感觉到压力特别大，哭了两回，因为车队是我发起的，但我没法为志愿者的生命安全负责。
28 is the outbreak period, Wuhan new 800 cases of diagnosis, I feel particularly stressed, crying twice, because I launched the convoy, but I can not be responsible for the lives of volunteers.
所以我就写一个倡议，我们从1月29号开始，暂停接单，当我们能获取en14126type4级别以上的防护服，和N95口罩，如果城市还需要我们，我们会继续接送医护人员。
So I'm going to write an initiative that we suspend orders from January 29, when we can get en14126 type 4 or above, and N95 masks, and we will continue to transport medical staff if the city still needs us.
往医院送紧缺物资但实际29号之后，我们车队并没有停止，主要是帮忙往一线运输物资。
We sent supplies to the hospital but after the actual number 29, our convoy did not stop, mainly to help transport supplies to the front line.
我也通过朋友想方设法地购买了一些。
I also managed to buy some through my friends.
物资真的非常紧缺，我把非医用的护目镜都送去了，医生发消息说哪怕是一块玻璃都要。
There was a real shortage of supplies. I sent my non-medical goggles, and the doctor told me to take even a piece of glass.
武汉医护在自制防护面罩1月30号下午4点，我接到10箱酒精，发了朋友圈后很多医生护士来找我，都说需要。
Wuhan Healthcare in the self-made protective mask January 30 4: 00 p.m., I received 10 cases of alcohol, sent friends after many doctors and nurses came to me, said that I need.
有个八医院的医护也来找我，我奇怪问你们八医院不是主要做肛肠科吗，他说现在也是定点医院了。
A doctor from an eight-hospital came to see me, and I wonder if your eight hospitals are doing anal surgery. He said it's a designated hospital now.
然后发来一张图，是他们医生自己动手，用文件夹做防护面罩。
Then they sent a picture of their doctor doing it by himself, using folders as a shield.
我看了这张图绷不住了，大哭。
I could not bear to look at the picture and cried.
我压力是山大，一方面怕志愿者生病，怕自己家里人生病，另一方面怕医护资源不够。
I am stressed mountain university, on the one hand, afraid of volunteers sick, afraid of their own family sick, on the other hand, afraid of inadequate medical resources.
等到疫情过去的那天，我最想见我的家人，抱抱亲亲孩子。
By the time the outbreak was over, I'd most like to see my family and hug my children.
“我每天睁开眼睛第一件事，想的就是去哪搞物资”武耀光 33岁职业：文身师疫情时期：为武汉筹集、运送物资我是中国文身协会湖北分会的会长，陕西人，娶了武汉媳妇，在武汉生活了多年，平时开一间文身工作室。
I am the president of the Hubei branch of the Chinese tattoo association. I have married Wuhan daughter-in-law, and I have been living in Wuhan for many years, usually running a tattoo studio.
文身师的职业挺尴尬，很多人觉得是不良分子，所以封城之后，“青山区疫情防控志愿队伍”接受我的报名加入，我还挺高兴。
The tattoo teacher's profession is quite awkward, many people think is the bad person, so after the closure of the city, "Qingshan area disease prevention and control volunteers" accepted my application to join, I am very happy.
武耀光报名青山区疫情防控志愿者我很快就发现医护和志愿者双方都非常缺乏防护物资，1月25号在中国文身协会会长天佑老师的支持下，我向协会中全国各地的文身师募集资金，第一次就筹到了77250元，我自己也捐了1万块。
With the support of Tattooing Association of China's Tattooing Association, I collected funds from tattooists all over the country, and for the first time raised 77250 yuan and donated 10,000 yuan myself.
这些钱全部都用来购买紧缺物资。
All this money was used to buy supplies in short supply.
买物资主要有几个渠道，去找武汉周边的一些口罩生产厂，不过现在大部分被政府接管了，这个也是好事。
There are several ways to buy supplies to some factories around Wuhan, but it's good that the government has taken over most of them.
还有大型志愿者团队的物资群，生产商会把他们的物资和合格证发进来，医生也在群里，他们看了说可以使用，我们就购买运过来。
There was also a large volunteer team, and the manufacturer would send in their supplies and certificates, and the doctors were in the group. They said they could use it, so we bought and shipped it.
另外就是去找囤积了物资的二手商人。
Another is to find second-hand dealers who hoard supplies.
运输物资途中的中饭买到物资之后，第一时间送到各个有需要的医院科室。
Lunch on the way to transport supplies after the purchase of supplies, the first time to the various hospital departments and offices in need.
一些物资达不到医用标准，我们就捐给社区、志愿者、一线记者、警察大队等等。
Some supplies do not meet medical standards, and we donate them to communities, volunteers, front-line journalists, police brigades, etc.
比如给武汉市公安局武昌分局送了N95口罩和护目镜，因为分局的警察要去武汉七医院驻守。
For example, Wuhan Public Security Bureau Wuchang sent N95 masks and goggles, because the police station to Wuhan seven hospitals to garrison.
他们只有一些医用外科口罩，防护服轮流着穿，根本不够，我知道他们有些人已经疑似感染，在家自我隔离。
They have only a few medical surgical masks, and the suits take turns, not enough, and I know that some of them are suspected to be infected and isolate themselves at home.
深夜帮忙搬运口罩到达中南医院第二天一早出发，采购消毒液31号晚上，我和另外的志愿者奔走在各个口罩厂商中间讨价还价，医用规格的口罩是每个1.8元，一直2月1号凌晨，终于拿到了货，连夜开车，凌晨2:40送了4万个口罩到达武汉中南医院，我还买了几万个单价1.25元的口罩，可以给非一线的人员。
On the night of February 1, my other volunteers and I raced through the night to haggle among the mask makers. The medical mask cost 1.8 yuan each. We finally got them in the early hours of February 1, drove overnight, delivered 40,000 masks to Wuhan Zhongnan Hospital, and bought tens of thousands of 1.25 yuan masks for non-frontline personnel.
这晚回到家找个沙发就躺下了，睡了3个小时，2月1号上午又去仙桃采购，买到了500斤酒精，50斤消毒液，给武汉一六一医院送了15斤酒精，20斤消毒液，给三医院、金银潭医院送……又去了各个社区发放，到了现在（采访是在2月1号晚上9点多进行）已经全部发空了。
On the morning of February 1, I went to the peach shop, bought 500 jin of alcohol and 50 jin of disinfectant, sent 15 jin of alcohol and 20 jin of disinfectant to Wuhan 161 hospital, sent to the three hospitals, gold and silver pool hospital.
我最大的感受就是，给每一个医院送东西对他们来说都是雪中送炭。
My biggest feeling is that sending something to every hospital is a silver bullet for them.
医护对我也很好，给我塞小瓶的消毒液，只允许我站在大门外头等他们过来拿，医者父母心。
Medical care was good for me, too. Fill me with a vial of disinfectant and allow me to stand outside the gate until they come and get it.
武耀光和领导商量医疗队物资采购因为我是地道的陕西娃，看到陕西医疗队来了就很激动，29号我去他们酒店看看有什么能帮上忙的，虽然住在酒店，但生活用品也还是有顾及不到的地方，我和医疗队领导商量，看他们缺什么，采购了洗衣液、盆、眼药水各种东西，给他们送去。
I went to their hotel on the 29th, to see what I could do. Although I stayed in the hotel, there was still something I could not take into account. I talked with the medical team leaders to see what they needed.
这几天通常是凌晨4点睡觉前，把送的物资做一个清单整理，早上7、8点醒来就开始找物资，中午的时候买到物资，联系需要的医院、社区开始送。
These days, before going to bed at 4: 00 a.m., we make a list of the things we deliver, wake up at 7 or 8 in the morning to look for supplies, buy them at noon, and contact the hospitals and communities in need.
其实我自己都没有驾照，全程是车队的志愿者跟我一起运送，这些武汉的本地人让我很感动，能看到武汉非常团结的一面。
In fact, I do not have a driver's license, the entire journey is the team of volunteers with me to transport, these Wuhan local people let me very moved, can see Wuhan very united side.
我每天早上扒开眼睛第一件事，就是想今天去哪买物资，再送哪些医院，做梦买到了口罩都是要笑醒的。
I pick up the eyes every morning the first thing, is to buy where to buy supplies today, and which hospitals, dream of buying masks are to laugh.
现在我们的物资车停在路边上，你打电话来我们正好休息一会。
Now our supply truck is parked on the side of the road. You call and we'll have a break.
但要先讲到这里了，群里说有30斤的酒精，我们要赶紧出发去买回来。
But to get to the point, the group said there was 30 kilos of alcohol, so we had to get out and get it back.
给医院送护目镜（左二是李峰，左三是武耀光）“我帮老武开车送物资，医生收到当宝贝一样”李峰 27岁职业：个体户，在武汉开紫燕百味鸡加盟店疫情时期：志愿者司机疫情爆发之前，我因为不知道情况，还跑去旅游了，1月19号在湖北神农架滑雪的时候摔裂了右边的肋骨，21号回到武汉看见新闻开始报道，我就想着能做点什么。
Li Feng 27-year-old occupation: self-employed, before the outbreak of the outbreak of volunteers in Wuhan, I also went on a trip, because I did not know the situation, Shennongjia skiing in Hubei Province on January 19, saw the news began to report, I would like to do something.
封城之后，一个开滴滴专车的朋友说政府会给每个大型社区配2-3台车，去做司机的话800块钱一天，问我要不要去。
After the city was closed, a drip-drip friend said the government would assign two or three cars to each large community and pay $800 a day as a driver to ask if I wanted to go.
但我不想做这个，我加入了两个志愿者的群，一个是专门接送医护人员，一个是和老武（武耀光）接送物资。
But I didn't want to do this. I joined a group of two volunteers, one to pick up medical staff and the other to pick up supplies from Lao Wu.
志愿者李峰因为肋骨骨裂还没修复，我开车久了就会疼，所以跑不了武汉市外，也不能搬运重物，只能在武汉市区内多做一些。
Li Feng volunteers because the rib fracture has not been repaired, I will drive a long time will hurt, so can not run outside Wuhan, can not carry heavy objects, can only do more in Wuhan City.
物资真的非常紧缺，1月30号下午我和老武去给青山区儿童医院送了15个护目镜，因为那有一批医生要上前线了，医生看到都当宝贝一样，太高兴了，还拜托我们再去找一些酒精。
The supplies are really scarce. On January 30 afternoon, Lao Wu and I went to Qingshan Children's Hospital to send 15 goggles because a group of doctors were going to the front line.
还有武汉市民志愿为医护人员剪头发接送医护的志愿者群目前有357个人，大约1/4是司机，其余是医护，他们会在群里发出行的需求，但是积极在接单的司机可能只是5、6个，如果路程远的单子回应就更慢了。
There are 357 volunteers in Wuhan who volunteer to have their hair cut and taken care of by medical staff. About a quarter of them are drivers and the rest are doctors. The rest of them will demand a trip in the group.
1月28号我去江夏接了一个年轻护士来青山区的医院，来回60多公里，预约单几十分钟都没有人响应，我就接了，她是回家搬生活用品的，因为医院帮他们找到了酒店住。
January 28th I went to Jiangxia to pick up a young nurse to the Qingshan District Hospital, more than 60 kilometers back and forth, the booking list did not respond for dozens of minutes, I took it, she was home to move supplies, because the hospital helped them find hotel accommodation.
1月29号送一个发热门诊30多岁的护士回家，她让我在楼下等一等，她拿趟东西又要去医院。
On January 29th she sent home a nurse in her 30s at the fever clinic. She told me to wait downstairs while she took her things to the hospital.
因为自我隔离，她和女儿在家都不能见面。
Because of her isolation, she and her daughter were unable to meet at home.
医护都没有自己的时间，坐上车之后都是马上能睡着的状态。
Medical personnel do not have their own time, after sitting in the car is immediately able to fall asleep.
李峰晾晒一下装备刚开始，仅有的防护就是跟朋友拿的3个N95口罩，每一个消毒过之后重复用，能用3天，今天拆了最后一个口罩，发朋友圈求助之后，有人愿意再给我1个，又可以用3天。
Li Feng air-drying equipment at the beginning, the only protection is to take three N95 masks with friends, each after disinfection and reuse, can take three days, today opened the last mask, sent friends for help, someone would like to give me another, can use three days.
我和老武买到的防护服因为数量少都给医院了，自己一个也没舍得留。
Lao Wu and I bought the protective clothing because of the small number of hospitals, not one of their own reluctant to stay.
我在家里面也是自我隔离，回家先要全身消毒，妈妈做好饭，等他们吃好回到房间之后，我再拿一次性筷子出来夹菜，回自己房间吃。
I am also self-isolation at home, home to disinfect the whole body, mother cooked food, when they are ready to eat back to the room, I took disposable chopsticks out to pick up vegetables, back to their room.
开车的时候，我主要想着下一个要去哪里，最好是一直在路上。
When driving, my main concern is where to go next, preferably always on the road.
这件事把我的生物钟也治好了，平时我都是睡到10点多，然后去自己店里看看，但最近每天6点就起来了。
This matter has cured my biological clock, I usually sleep until more than 10 o'clock, and then go to his shop to see, but recently every day at 6 o'clock up.
现在是晚上9点半，就先说到这里了，我一会还要再出门去接两个医护，10点钟一个，12点一个，明天早上6点多还要去接一个住在汉口的，路程挺远。
It's 9: 30 p. m., and I'm going out to pick up two more paramedics later, one at 10 o'clock, one at 12: 00, and one in Hankou at six o'clock tomorrow morning.
青山区车队志愿者李耀星“其他志愿者看着我和小孩一样，就问我多大，我说是99年生的”李耀星 21岁职业：武汉的大学生疫情时期：青山区车队志愿者我家在武汉青山区，也在武汉念大学，半年前拿到的驾照。
Li Yaoxing, a volunteer for the Qingshan team, "Other volunteers looked at me and asked me how old I was, I said I was born in '99." Li Yaoxing 21-year-old Profession: College Student Epidemic Period in Wuhan
看到青山区团委组织志愿者的消息，我就报名了免费接送医护人员。
Seeing the news that the Qingshan League organized volunteers, I signed up for the free transport of medical personnel.
爸妈一直都是担心的，出门之前，妈妈会看着我戴好口罩，给我喷酒精。
Mom and Dad are always worried, before going out, my mother will watch me wear a mask, I spray alcohol.
我爸爸是退伍军人，有现在很需要的A2驾照，他也很想参加，但因为有些感冒，就自己在家隔离。
My father, a veteran, had the much-needed A2 license, and he wanted to join, but because of a cold, he isolated himself at home.
李耀星拍摄的车窗外记得1月25号接了第一个单，是一个在武钢总医院值完班的护士，晚上9点下着小雨，她说幸亏我愿意来，否则她就要冒雨走到大道上去看有没有车。
Li Yaoxing's car window remembered the first order on January 25, a nurse who had finished work at the General Hospital of Wuhan Iron and Steel. It was raining at 9: 00 p.m. She said she was lucky I'd come, or she would walk down the road in the rain to see if there was a car.
早上7点接了一位97年的护士，她下车给我发消息说“特别想给你买份早餐，又怕耽误你时间。
I picked up a 97-year-old nurse at 7 a. m., and she got out and sent me a message saying, "I want to buy you breakfast especially, and I'm afraid of delaying you.
”这样简单的沟通让我觉得很温暖。
"This simple communication made me feel warm.
最忙的一天是去蔡甸区仓库接物资，有一千箱水、口罩手套等等，搬运的时候，其他志愿者看着我和小孩一样，就问我多大，我说是99年生的。
The busiest day was to pick up supplies from a warehouse in Cai Den. There were a thousand boxes of water, masks and gloves. When the volunteers looked at me and the kids, they asked me how old I was.
李耀星拍摄的车窗外一个40多岁的女医生，封城之后，她要骑40分钟自行车上下班。
Li Yaoxing's car outside the window of a woman doctor in her 40s, after the closure of the city, she will ride a 40-minute bike to work.
