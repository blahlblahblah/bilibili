澎湃新闻记者 刘栋 实习生 董安琪新冠病毒疫情在韩国的发展突然加速。
Peng Pai journalist Liu Dong intern Dong Anqi New Crown Virus outbreak in South Korea suddenly accelerated the development.
2月20日，韩国新增53例确诊病例，超过了过去一个月所有确诊病例总和。
On February 20, 53 new cases were confirmed in South Korea, more than the total number of all confirmed cases in the past month.
21日上午，韩国疾病预防控制中心（KCDC）最新通报称，再新增52例确诊病例，目前全国累计确诊已增至156例。
On the morning of May 21, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) announced that 52 new cases were confirmed, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 156 nationwide.
而这一切，与大邱市的一起“超级传播事件”有着直接的关联，韩国疾控部门认为，目前，至少有82名确诊病例与该事件相关。
All this is directly linked to a "super-epidemic" in Daegu, where the South Korean CDC believes at least 82 confirmed cases are linked to the incident.
韩国防疫人员在大邱市进行消毒超级传播事件仅仅在短短三天时间里，韩国的疫情就突然发生了“翻天覆地”的变化。
In just three days, South Korea's epidemic has changed dramatically, with anti-epidemic workers disinfecting the city of Daegu.
据澎湃新闻（www.thepaper.cn）统计，在12日到17日间，韩国有5天新确诊病例为零增长，16日韩国政府首次通报了第29、30两例感染途径不明的病例。
According to the surging news (www.thepper.cn), there was zero growth in newly confirmed cases in South Korea for five days between 12 and 17, with the government reporting its first 29 and 30 cases of undetermined infection on the 16th day.
18日，第31例病例出现，疫情开始向失控的方向发展。
18, 31 cases appeared, the outbreak began to spiral out of control.
19日，韩国突增15例确诊，20日，激增53例，21日上午，再增52例。
On July 19, South Korea suddenly increased 15 cases of diagnosis, 20, 53 cases, 21 morning, a further 52 cases.
韩国目前已确诊的156例新冠病毒感染病例中，111例出现在庆尚北道和大邱市。
Of the 156 confirmed cases of new crown virus infection in South Korea, 111 occurred in the cities of Gyeongshan North and Daegu.
其中与大邱市一所教会的聚集性感染有关的至少有82例。
There were at least 82 cases of conglomerate infection associated with a church in Daegu.
另外一个主要感染群在庆尚北道淸道郡一所医院内，目前感染确诊人数为16人，其中5人为该院护士。
The other major group of infections was at a hospital in Gyeongchai North Province, where the number of confirmed cases was 16, five of whom were nurses from the hospital.
20日韩国首例死亡病例也发生在该医院。
South Korea 20, the first case of death also occurred in the hospital.
据韩国防疫部门的通报：触发大邱市社区传播并引爆疫情连锁效应的“第31例病例”，是一名61岁的大邱女性。
A 61-year-old Daegu woman was the thirty-first case to trigger a chain effect of spreading and detonating an epidemic in Daegu city, the epidemic prevention agency said.
她在过去3个月内没有出过国，也没有与疫区高风险者有“明确接触”史。
She has not been abroad in the past three months, nor has she had a history of "clear contact" with people at high risk in the affected areas.
她曾在1月底因车祸在首尔就医，在2月4日开始出现发烧症状，之后去医院治疗，然而直到2月17日确诊前，这名感染者一直在四处活动，尤其是前后4次前往当地一所教会参加聚会活动。
She had been hospitalized for a car accident in Seoul at the end of January, developed fever symptoms on 4 February and then went to hospital. However, until her diagnosis on 17 February, the infected person had been moving around, in particular to a local church gathering on four occasions.
一直关注韩国疫情发展的韩国华人律师张智华向澎湃新闻介绍，“之所以当中隔了十几天才确诊，是因为韩国医疗部门认为她既没有中国旅行史，也没有和疫情高危人士的接触史，因而忽略了她，只是当做普通的流感症状患者。
Zhang Zhihua, a South Korean Chinese lawyer who has been following the South Korean epidemic, told the roar news that "the delay of more than 10 days is due to the fact that South Korean medical authorities believe she has neither a history of travel to China nor any contact with people at high risk of the disease," Zhang Zhihua, a South Korean lawyer who has been following the outbreak, told the news.
”这样的分析也从韩国防疫部门的表态中找到印证——韩国中央应急处置本部副本部长金刚立在20日的发布会上承认，新冠状病毒疫情已出现防疫网之外的案例，开始在社区全面扩散。
"This analysis is also confirmed by the South Korean epidemic prevention agency's position - South Korea Central Emergency Response Agency copy minister Kim Gang-li acknowledged at a press conference on the 20th that the new coronavirus epidemic has occurred outside the epidemic prevention network, and began to spread across the community.
而造成大邱市疫情大规模扩散的，或与第31例病例在出现症状到确诊之间频繁的活动有关。
The large-scale spread of Daegu city disease, or 31 cases between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis of frequent activities.
据张智华的介绍，该病例在近两周时间内，不仅往返于首尔与大邱之间，还在大邱市本地前往过公司、多家当地医院、教会、酒店等多处人员密集场所。
Zhang said the case had traveled between Seoul and Taegu in the past two weeks and had traveled to a number of densely populated places in Daegu city, including companies, local hospitals, churches and hotels.
最让人担心的，是她四次前往当地一所教会参加聚会活动，其中两次是在出现症状之后。
Most worrying was her four visits to a local church to attend parties, two of which followed symptoms.
这家教会正是此次“超级传播事件”的中心。
The church is at the heart of this "super-media event."
据韩国媒体报道，该教会是1984年建立的一个新兴宗教组织，在韩国社会颇富争议性，有人将其视之为极端团体，并受到正统基督教会的抵制。
According to South Korean media reports, the Church is a new religious organization founded in 1984, which is controversial in Korean society and is perceived by some as extremist and boycotted by orthodox Christian churches.
据张智华介绍，这家教会聚会人数有1000多人，每周日的礼拜活动持续两个多小时。
The congregation numbered more than 1,000 people and Sunday prayers lasted more than two hours, Zhang said.
聚会中，所有的教徒会在相对密闭的空间内席地而坐，用双臂拥抱彼此的肩膀唱歌。
At parties, all believers sit on the floor in relatively closed spaces, embracing each other's shoulders and singing.
聚会结束后还会在咖啡厅和饭店等地频繁聚集，这种密切的接触，加大了彼此感染和传播病毒的可能性。
The close contact of frequent gatherings at cafes and restaurants increases the likelihood of one another contracting and spreading the virus.
韩国防疫部门表示，目前已从该教会获取了2月9日和16日与第31例患者一起进行礼拜的1001名教徒的名单，正在对这些人员采取居家隔离措施，并通过电话确认这些人员是否出现症状。
South Korea's epidemic prevention agency said it had obtained a list of 1,001 people from the church who attended services with the thirty-first cases on February 9 and 16, who were being placed in quarantine and had their symptoms confirmed by telephone.
截至21日上午，已有至少90人出现症状，还有57人尚未取得联系。
By the morning of the 21st, at least 90 people had developed symptoms and 57 had not been reached.
感染范围可能进一步扩大。
The infection is likely to spread further.
“从韩国政府的表态来看，大邱市目前的情况是比较严峻的。
"Judging from the South Korean government's position, the situation in Daegu is grim.
韩国政府对疫情的反应其实一直做的不错。
The South Korean government's response to the epidemic has been good.
然而由于这个病毒潜伏期很长，传染性强的特点，再加上31例病例的特殊情况，还是出现了韩国政府最害怕的社区传播情况，在当前的情况下，为了避免疫情进一步扩大，大邱市或许应该考虑封城。
However, due to the long incubation period and high infectivity of the virus, coupled with the special circumstances of 31 cases, the spread of the communities most feared by the Korean Government has emerged. In the current circumstances, Daegu may be considered for closure in order to avoid further spread of the disease.
”张智华说道。
"said Zhang.
尽举国之力克服疫情21日上午，韩国国务总理丁世均在中央政府首尔办公楼主持中央应急处置扩大会议时表示，将把新冠病毒感染病例剧增的大邱市、庆尚北道清道郡指定为传染病特别管理地区，立即采取相关措施防控疫情。
Ding Shi, South Korea's premier, said Monday that he would designate Daegu, Qingdao Gyeongshan province, which has seen a sharp increase in new cases of the virus, as a special infectious disease management area and take immediate measures to prevent and control the outbreak.
丁世均表示，政府将在该地区采取特别防疫措施，全面提供病床和人力物力支持。
Ding said the government will take special measures to prevent the disease in the region, providing full hospital beds and human and material support.
在国内累计确诊病例过百，部分地区还出现社区感染的情况下，将把防疫重点由防止病毒从国外流入境内转为严防国内社区传染，尽举国之力克服疫情。
With a cumulative total of over 100 confirmed cases in the country and the emergence of community-based infections in some areas, the focus of the epidemic will be shifted from preventing the flow of the virus from abroad to strictly preventing transmission within the domestic community, making every effort to overcome the epidemic.
20日，重灾区大邱市市长权泳臻更是在电视新闻发布会上直呼，“我们正处于前所未有的危机之中。
"We are in the midst of an unprecedented crisis," Kuan Yongzhen, mayor of Daegu city, said in a televised news conference.
”他敦促250万大邱市市民尽量减少外出或不要外出，以降低和防止感染新冠肺炎的可能性。
He urged 2.5 million residents of Daegu to minimize the risk of contracting pneumonia by going out or staying out.
他表示将会对上述教堂的所有信徒进行全面检测，并要求他们待在家中不要外出，并且与自己的家人也进行隔离处置。
He said all members of the church would be thoroughly tested and asked not to go out at home and to be quarantined with their families.
同时，大邱市政府下令关闭所有幼儿园，所有学校都考虑推迟原定3月初开始的春季学期。
Meanwhile, the Daegu municipality ordered the closure of all kindergartens, and all schools were considering postponing the spring semester, which had been scheduled to begin in early March.
大邱市位于韩国东南部，是韩国的第四大城市，距离首都首尔不到一个半小时车程，人口约250万。
The city of Daegu, located in southeastern South Korea, is South Korea's fourth largest city, less than an hour and a half from the capital, Seoul, with a population of about 2.5 million.
据韩联社报道，从20日起，大邱市原本熙熙攘攘的商圈、餐馆和街道，开始变得人流稀少，甚至空无一人，不少市民戴上了口罩，并且相隔甚远，当地网友形容场景仿佛“灾难电影一般”。
From 20 onwards, Daegu's bustling shopping district, restaurants and streets began to become sparsely populated, even empty, with many citizens wearing masks and far apart, local netizens described the scene as a "disaster movie."
为了抵御蔓延的病毒，该市已采取措施暂时关闭公共图书馆，大邱高等法院等公共机构暂时封锁了其大院的某些入口，并安装了热像仪。
To combat the spread of the virus, the city had taken steps to temporarily close public libraries, and public institutions such as the Daegu High Court had temporarily blocked certain entrances to its compound and installed thermal cameras.
原定于3月8日在大邱体育场举行的明星演唱会被推迟或取消。
