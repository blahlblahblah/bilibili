作为一名医生，我十分清楚在每一个新冠肺炎患者背后，都有一个备受煎熬的家庭，这个坎能不能过去，需要大家一起扛。
As a doctor, I know very well that behind every person suffering from pneumonia, there is a very miserable family.
而随着武汉封城时间越来越长，一些非新冠肺炎的病患，同样也在默默承受着煎熬。
With the closure of Wuhan more and more time, some patients with non-new crown pneumonia, also suffering in silence.
口述 | 郑　华整理 | 吴　雪早上八点，我下夜班，接班的同事准点到了，我嘱咐好病房负责的病人，满身疲惫地走进医院的更衣室，脱掉防护服，摘掉护目镜，深呼了一大口气。
At eight o'clock in the morning, when my shift colleague arrived, I instructed the patient in charge of the ward to walk wearily into the changing room of the hospital, undress, remove the goggles and take a deep breath.
许久未关注医院窗外的风景，树木仿佛发出了新芽。
After a long time without looking out of the hospital window, the trees seemed to sprout new shoots.
作为华中科技大学附属同济医院麻醉科的一名医生，2月29日，是我返岗的第9天，工作时间与新冠病毒赛跑“抢人”，休息时间看诊非新冠病人，已成为我近一周的常态。
As a doctor attached to Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, February 29, I returned to the nine-day, working hours with the new crown virus race "hijacking", rest time to see non-new patients, has become the norm for me for nearly a week.
穿着防护服的郑华在华中科技大学附属同济医院病区　受访者供图回想这一个月以来，我内心的煎熬、希望、纠结，全部搅合在一起，一刻也没停下来过。
Zheng Hua, wearing protective clothing at the Tongji Hospital, affiliated with the Central University of Science and Technology, gave a picture of my inner torment, hope and confusion over the past month.
我平时工作很忙，春节假期，本打算好好陪陪家人。
I usually work very busy, Spring Festival holiday, had planned to accompany the family well.
但1月24日，疫情暴发了，我第一时间决定放弃休假返岗，家人也很支持。
But on January 24th, when the outbreak broke out, I immediately decided to give up my vacation and return to work, and my family was supportive.
你问我为什么2月中旬才返回工作岗位，因为还没上岗的1月28日，意外情况发生了。
You asked me why I did not return to work until mid-February, when the unexpected happened on 28 January, when I was not on duty.
那天，我爱人突然发烧了，量了体温不到38℃，不算高烧。
That day, my wife suddenly had a fever, measured less than 38 degrees Celsius, not high fever.
当时并不能确定是新冠肺炎，但鉴于病毒的不确定性以及作为医生的职业敏感，我当机立断：不管怎样，都必须隔离。
It wasn't certain it was new crown pneumonia, but given the uncertainty of the virus and the sensitivity of my profession as a doctor, I decided I had to be isolated anyway.
我和岳母腾出手来整理了带有洗手间的主卧，第一天就让爱人隔离了进去，上了锁。
My mother-in-law and I freed our hands to clean up the master bedroom with the bathroom, and on the first day we insulated our loved ones and locked them.
我有两个孩子，一个7岁，一个3岁，刚开始他们并不理解，哭着闹着非要拧开门把手找妈妈。
I had two children, a seven-year-old and a three-year-old, who, at first, did not understand and cried and insisted on unscrewing the doorknob to look for my mother.
后来，视频了几次，孩子没辙，也只能安生了。
Afterwards, the video several times, the child has no way, also can only have a peaceful birth.
爱人隔离以后，我们开始对症处理，吃退烧药降温。
After the separation of lovers, we began to treat symptoms, take antipyretics to cool down.
一日三餐之前，我都会通过微信或者视频连线通知开饭，把饭菜装进饭盒，放在门口，那种滋味基本和“坐监”差不多。
Three meals a day, I will be through a micro-letter or video link to notify the dinner, food into the box, on the door, the taste of the basic "sitting in prison.
第二天，体温一下子蹿到了高烧39℃，而且总是反反复复，下午和晚上特别明显。
The next day, the temperature jumped up to 39 degrees Celsius, and always repeated, particularly in the afternoon and evening.
还好，爱人性格开朗，凡事想得开，心态也比较好。
Fortunately, the spouse is cheerful personality, all things open-minded, mentality is also better.
2月18日，华中科技大学附属同济医院中法新城院区的护士正在交班　图｜新华社2月3日，反复高烧到第7天，爱人一直没有好转，我着急了。
Feb. 18, nurses from Tongji Hospital in Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, are on their way to work. Xinhua reported February 3, 2007, seven days after fever, my lover has not improved.
决定带她去到医院门诊拍CT。
It was decided to take her to the hospital for a CT scan.
果然，CT结果显示双肺感染，高度疑似新冠肺炎。
Sure enough, CT findings showed two-lung infection with a high degree of suspected new crown pneumonia.
当时医院床位紧缺，同事们已经疲累应战，虽然检查是在我工作的医院，但我并不想去打扰他们，当天我就带爱人回家了。
There was a shortage of hospital beds and my colleagues were tired and I didn't want to disturb them even though I was in the hospital where I was working.
2月4日，医院通知其中一个分院改成了定点收治医院，爱人可以入院。
On 4 February, the hospital informed one of the branches that it had been converted into a designated hospital and that the loved one could be admitted to hospital.
我收拾了生活必需品，开车送爱人前往，当时驰援的团队是山东省医疗队，照顾非常周到。
I packed up the necessities of life, driving his wife to go, then the rescue team is Shandong Province medical team, very thoughtful care.
虽然一路上戴了口罩，也做了防护，但为了安全起见，把爱人安置好后，我决定暂不返岗，在居家隔离了七天后，我打电话给同济医院医务处，说明了当时接触情况，目前身体无异样，申请上岗。
Although I wore a mask and protected my wife on the way, I decided not to return from work for safety reasons. After seven days of isolation at home, I called the Tongji Hospital Medical Service to explain the contacts and apply for the job.
大概沟通了四五次，2月20日，我正式返回了工作岗位。
About four or five times, February 20, I officially returned to work.
2月18日，在华中科技大学附属同济医院中法新城院区新冠肺炎重症病区，一位患者出院　图｜新华社14天后，爱人核酸检测正常，正式出院，需居家隔离。
On Feb. 18, 2007, a patient was discharged from the hospital of Tongji Hospital, a hospital in Tongji, central China. One patient was discharged from the hospital after being tested for nucleic acid, and was discharged from the hospital.
上班我一点都不害怕，最担心的是岳母一个人在家，带两个孩子，太吵太闹，还要照顾爱人和刚刚做完肺癌手术的岳父。
My mother-in-law was alone, with two children, too noisy and caring for her lover and her father-in-law who had recently had lung cancer surgery.
如果精力顾不上来，一不小心就会交叉感染。
If you neglect your energy, you will become cross-infected.
上班前几天，我开始每天培训岳母如何做好防护和消毒。
A few days before I went to work, I began training my mother-in-law every day on how to protect and disinfect.
比如，将84消毒液配比成一定浓度，擦拭门把手、卫生间、马桶圈等公共接触位置；碗筷用完后，用带有紫外线和高温臭氧的消毒柜消毒。
For example, use a concentration of disinfectant 84 to clean the door knobs, bathrooms, toilet bowls, etc. Chopsticks are used up and disinfected with disinfectant cabinets with ultraviolet and high-temperature ozone.
直到现在，我们都很好，说明这个方法有效。
Until now, we have been doing well, which shows that this method works.
再比如，卫生间纸篓倒出来的垃圾，扔到楼下之前一定要喷上消毒液，因为如果携带病毒，将危及到环卫工人的健康。
For example, waste from the toilet paper basket must be sprayed with disinfectant before being thrown downstairs, as carrying the virus could endanger the health of sanitation workers.
之前爱人住院，隔壁床位上就是一个捡垃圾为生老婆婆，因为垃圾携带病毒而被感染，所以一定要处理，不要害人。
Before the wife was hospitalized, next bed is a garbage collection for a living old woman, because garbage carrying the virus and infected, so must deal with, do not harm.
郑华母亲在他上一线前写给他的纸条　受访者供图20号我正式上班了，被分到了新冠肺炎的危重症科室，这里有四十多个病人，医生数量加上感染科、呼吸科共有18个人。
2007-9-24 16: 16 I am officially at work. I am assigned to the Critical Care Unit of New Crown Pneumonia, where there are more than 40 patients, the number of doctors plus the Department of Infection and Respiratory Department 18 people.
不像开始的“疲劳应战”，我们有五组人实行轮班制，白天一组人，晚上一组人，基本上可以保证上两天，休三天。
Unlike the initial "fatigue response," we had five teams working in shifts, with a day shift system and a group of people in the evening that basically allowed two days and three days off.
院方也强调，只要感觉不舒服，千万不要硬撑，一定要第一时间报备。
The hospital also stressed that as long as you feel uncomfortable, do not push hard, must be first reported.
现在重症入院的病人少了许多，每天平均能一两个治愈病例，但我个人觉得，目前的数字还不能放松警惕，特别是出院的病人以及有可能密切接触病患的人，还需要密切观察，降低感染风险。
There are now far fewer cases of severe hospital admissions, averaging one or two cases per day, but I personally feel that the current figures do not allow for a relaxation of vigilance, especially for patients discharged from hospitals and those likely to be in close contact with patients, and for close observation to reduce the risk of infection.
工作9天，我接待了许多病人家属，由于无法与亲人见面，只能托我带话。
I worked nine days, I received many patients family members, unable to meet with relatives, can only entrust me with a message.
但最明显的是家属与患者两者的心理反差。
But the most obvious is the psychological contrast between family members and patients.
家属表达关心，但患者往往报喜不报忧，他不会说这个药难吃，更不会说自己浑身难受睡不着觉，通常会传递积极向上的话，实际上也是给自己打气。
He doesn't say it's awful to eat, and he doesn't say that he doesn't sleep all over. It usually conveys positive words and actually gives himself a boost.
郑华医生与新冠肺炎患者沟通　受访者供图Play郑华医生为新冠肺炎患者看诊武汉作家方方说，时代的一粒灰，落在个人头上，就是一座山。
2007-9-24 16: 23 Dr. Cheng Hua interacts with New Crown Pneumonia Interviewee: Dr. Play Zhenghua is visiting Wuhan writer Fang Fang, the author of New Crown Pneumonia.
我们唯一的事，就是把这一切都扛下来。
The only thing we can do is carry it all over our shoulders.
作为一名医生，我十分清楚在每一个新冠肺炎患者背后，都有一个备受煎熬的家庭，这个坎能不能过去，需要大家一起扛。
As a doctor, I know very well that behind every person suffering from pneumonia, there is a very miserable family.
而随着武汉封城时间越来越长，一些非新冠肺炎的病患，同样也在默默承受着煎熬。
With the closure of Wuhan more and more time, some patients with non-new crown pneumonia, also suffering in silence.
2月28日，我下了夜班，驱车回到距离同济医院车程半个小时的隔离酒店。
On February 28, I got off the graveyard shift and drove back to the isolated hotel half an hour's drive from Tongji Hospital.
刚刚洗了把脸坐定，电脑屏幕上就弹出了“有人挂号”的页面，问诊的是一名肺癌晚期患者，夫妇俩大概六七十岁，老太太说知道自己时日无多，不想在疫情期间，给医生增加负担。
Just as she was washing her face, a registered page popped up on the computer screen asking for a patient with terminal lung cancer. The couple were about 60 or 70 years old and the old lady said she knew her days were numbered and did not want to burden her doctors during the outbreak.
但每天疼得睡不着觉，止疼药已经吃完了，实在买不到药，求求我开点药。
But every day pain can not sleep, pain medication has been eaten, really can not buy medicine, please I write some medicine.
在隔离宾馆，我用一台电脑接诊非新冠肺炎病人　受访者供图我听了她的话，心里特别难受。
In the quarantined hotel, I used a computer to receive patients with non-Newly crowned Pneumonia.
帮她开了些止疼的药，按照地址邮寄给了这位患者。
She was prescribed some painkillers and mailed to the patient according to the address.
后来，我还接诊了四五个颈肩疼痛的患者。
Later, I treated four or five patients with neck and shoulder pain.
出诊一周，问诊的人并不多，我想大多数并不知道医院还有“云门诊”服务。
Not many people visit the hospital for a week and I don't think most of them know there is a "cloud clinic" service.
2月14日，“同济云门诊”在“掌上同济”APP正式上线，点击在线问诊按钮，即可进入科室选择，135个专家、50个科室、469名医生开通视频以及图文问诊，可开具在线处方，实现药品线下配送。
Feb. 14, "Tongji Cloud Clinic" in the "Palm Tongji" APP officially went online, click the online consultation button, can enter the section selection, 135 experts, 50 departments, 469 doctors opened video and text consultation, can issue online prescription, realize off-line distribution.
“云门诊”患者图文咨询看诊页面　受访者供图药房备药后由快递寄出，邮寄费用到付，包裹状态可追踪　图｜华中科技大学附属同济医院官网每个科室每日上午、上午均有至少一位医生在线视频问诊，我是副高职称，2004年毕业于同济医学院后，就在这里工作至今。
Cloud Outpatient Consultation Page Subjects are offered medical supplies by courier service, delivery by post, package status traceable, etc., at least one doctor per morning and every morning in every office, I have been working here since I graduated from Tongji Medical College in 2004.
但在云门诊里，不管是副高还是正高，挂号费用都一样，只需几块钱即可，挂号成功后，医生会根据门诊挂号一样，依次叫号。
However, in the cloud clinic, the registration fee is the same whether it is high or low. Only a few yuan is enough. When the registration is successful, the doctor will order the number according to the outpatient registration number.
昨天晚上，11点半，我又接诊了一个皮疹患者的图文咨询，虽然是小问题，但对生活质量影响很大，我特别能理解；求助到周刊的湖北肝癌患者，因为没有地方化疗，疼痛难忍，我今天了解到，医院肿瘤科开启了部分非新冠肺炎病人的床位，但住院流程可能与以往不同，比如家属不能陪伴、需要单独隔离居住等。
Last night, at 11: 30, I received a photo-text consultation for a patient with rashes. Although it was a minor problem, it had a great impact on the quality of life.
如果需要，我也能提供帮助。
I can help if I need to.
穿着防护服的郑华医生在华中科技大学附属同济医院病区　受访者供图我认为，帮助非新冠肺炎患者解决病患之忧，有利于他们更好地配合居家隔离。
Dr Cheng Hua, wearing protective clothing, provided information to the respondents in the Tongji Hospital, an affiliated hospital of the Central University of Science and Technology.
工作之余，我得知爱人回家后，发烧又反复了，开始是发烧，吃了药又退了。
After work, I learned that the lover came home, fever again and again, the first fever, took medicine and then back.
我心里忐忑，知道这并不是个好征兆，目前她仍一人坚持隔离在主卧室，岳母一个六十多岁的老人，照顾一家四口的饮食起居，还要防范感染风险，而我帮不上她们什么忙，我们唯一能做的就是通过视频互相打气。
I perturbed to know that this is not a good omen, she is still alone in the master bedroom, a mother-in-law in her sixties, care for a family of four people living, and protect themselves from the risk of infection, and I can't help them.
无论医生还是患者，大家或许都有这样、那样的难处，但往乐观方面想，至少困难的时刻已经过去。
Whether you're a doctor or a patient, you may have difficulties of one sort or another, but on the upbeat side, at least the hard times are over.
作为一名医生，我认为把目前已经收治的病人治好，控制新感染源不扩散，再把非新冠肺炎病人照顾好，局势总有扭转的一天。
As a doctor, I believe that the situation will always turn around once the patients who have been admitted are cured, the new sources of infection are controlled, and the patients with non-new crown pneumonia are taken care of.
