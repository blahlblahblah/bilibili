金银潭医院重症监护病房南六病区的护士凌云，随安徽医疗队到达金银潭医院支援的第一天，彭银华就出现在了她当天的日志里。
Ling Yun, a nurse in the intensive care unit of the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital, appeared in Anhui Medical Team's journal on the first day of her arrival at the hospital.
“医生患者呼吸急促达40-50次/分，且深大，严重的碱中毒”，2月2日晚，凌云在日志里记录首次见到彭银华的状况。
"Doctors reported 40-50 shortness of breath and severe, severe alkalosis," Lingyun wrote in his journal on the night of February 2 that he had first seen Peng Yinhua.
在当天，经过一系列的治疗措施后，彭银华的血气分析指标终于向正常值靠近，胃口也渐好，他吃了两份半流质食物，还喝了百普力（营养液）。

图源受访者6楼6床的彭银华给不少护士都留下好印象。
The 6-bed Peng Yinhua on the 6th floor made a good impression on many nurses.
在接受无创呼吸机和各种穿刺时，彭银华格外配合。
Peng Yinhua was especially helpful in receiving a non-invasive ventilator and various puncture.
“我们经常要给病人抽动脉血看肺氧合情况，抽的时候很疼，有时候动脉很难打上，但他就是能忍着动都不动让你穿刺。
"We often have to give the patient arterial blood to see pulmonary oxygenation. It hurts a lot when you smoke, and sometimes the arteries are difficult to get into, but he just can't move enough to let you pierce.
”凌云说。
"said Ling.
因为呼吸不畅，大部分病人平日里都会觉得特别疲劳。
Most patients feel particularly tired on weekdays due to poor breathing.
病情在夜晚带来的不适感更强，彭银华住院期间大多习惯在白天睡觉，晚上醒着。
Peng Yinhua was used to sleeping during the day and waking up at night.
凌云就劝他，“白天少睡一点，晚上睡，别把生物钟搞乱了”，凌云没想到的是，彭银华很快便听进去了，一到晚上就把手机关了，安静睡觉。
Ling Yun advised him to "sleep less during the day, sleep at night, don't mess up the biological clock." To his surprise, Peng Yinhua soon listened to it and turned off his hands at night and went to sleep quietly.
护士们都关注着这位“医生患者”的病况，她们通过玻璃窗户看到病房中的病人，机器显示“生命体征平稳”，病人状态显示“情绪平稳”。
The nurses watched as the "doctor" patient looked through a glass window at patients in the ward. The machine showed "signs of life are stable" and the patient's condition was "calm."
但是变化来得突然，2月8日，彭银华的心率加快，“开始是80几，后面就达到130 左右”，到当天下午两点多，彭银华的血氧饱和浓度也开始下降，医生给他进行气管插管治疗，上了呼吸机。
But the change came suddenly. On Feb. 8, Peng Yinhua's heart rate quickened. "From about 80 to about 130," Peng Yinhua's blood oxygen saturation began to drop by 2: 00 p. m., and doctors treated him with a trachea intubation and a ventilator.
接踵而至的是肾和肺的衰竭，“呼酸特别严重，肺部的二氧化碳根本排不出来”，“带呼吸机两天之后，发现小便也没有了，开始做肾透析”。
Then came kidney and lung failure. "Exhaustion was so bad that carbon dioxide from the lungs didn't come out at all," he said. "After two days with a ventilator, I found my urine was gone and I started dialysis.
就彭银华的病情骤变问题，凌云曾向主治医生询问，医生说彭银华正处于炎症风暴期，很多重症病人都会经历，“如果病人扛过去了就好了，扛不住就没了”。
On Peng Yinhua's condition suddenly changed, Ling Yun asked the doctor, the doctor said that Peng Yinhua is in an inflammatory storm, many patients will experience, "if the patient carried the past, I can not carry no."
彭银华陷入深度昏迷状态，2月19日，医院为他进行了血浆置换，护士张春艳在彭银华身边守了3个小时，看着那40袋50毫升的血浆随着导管流入彭银华的身体，像是一点一点注入康复的希望，“我们都希望他快点好，”张春艳说。
Peng Yinhua fell into a deep coma. Feb. 19, the hospital for his plasma replacement, nurses Zhang Chunyan at Peng Yinhua side for three hours, watching the 40 bags of 50ml of plasma following the catheter into Peng Yinhua's body, as if injects hope for a quick recovery, "Zhang said.

图源网络倒在抗疫岗位上有关感染新冠病毒的描述，凌云从彭银华那里听到过，“两天时间里，他接诊了300个患者，因为过度疲劳而抵抗力下降”。
Ling heard from Peng Yinhua, who described the infection on his anti-epidemic post. "In two days, he treated 300 patients because of fatigue and reduced resistance."
疫情发生时，距彭银华成为正式医生才过去半年。
When the outbreak occurred, only six months after Peng Yinhua became an official doctor.
2015年6月，彭银华招聘进入到江夏区第一人民医院实习，2016年，在考取执业医生证后，他去到协和医院本部进行了为期3年的培训，2019年6月回到江夏区第一人民医院正式成为一名呼吸内科医生。
In June 2015, Peng Yinhua was recruited to work as an intern at the First People's Hospital in Jiangxia District. In 2016, after obtaining a medical practitioner's certificate, he attended the Concorde Hospital headquarters for three years and returned to the First People's Hospital in June 2019 to become a respiratory physician.
1月21日，彭银华所在的呼吸与危重症医学科三病区被列为第二批投入收治“不明原因的病毒性肺炎”的住院隔离病区。
On January 21, Peng Yinhua's Respiratory and Critical Medicine Division was listed as the second group of hospitalized quarantined areas for "unspecified viral pneumonia."
江夏区第一人民医院副院长刘本德在接受媒体采访时透露，疫情暴发初期，该院还未被列为定点医院之前，居住在武汉郊区的非重症和非危重症的患者，若城区医院暂不收治，患者们都会涌向这里。
In an interview with the media, Liu Bende, vice-president of the First People's Hospital of Jiangxia District, told reporters that the hospital had not been designated as a designated hospital in the early stage of the outbreak.
而截至2月14日，该院收治新冠肺炎患者累计接近600人。
As of February 14, the hospital admitted nearly 600 patients with pneumonia.
妻子钟欣回忆，1月下旬以来，彭银华明显更加忙碌，“他总是加班，经常晚上回到家都是10、11点左右”。
His wife, Zhong Xin, recalls that Mr. Pang has been noticeably busier since late January: 'He always works overtime, and often comes home around 10 or 11 at night.
在医院的隔离病区组建以后，彭银华作为呼吸内科医生，需要"白班加夜班"轮班倒，他变得更加忙碌，因为担心给家人带来感染风险，彭银华干脆住进了医院，此后再没有回过家。
When the hospital's isolation unit was set up, Mr. Pang needed & quot; as a respiratory physician; day shift and night shift; and he became busier as he stayed at the hospital for fear of infecting his family.
彭银华在医院忙碌的时间里，钟欣只能通过微信和他交流：“我让他不要太劳累，要注意休息时，他却说不累，说这样的忙碌让他觉得很充实”。
"I told him not to work too hard, but to pay attention to rest, he said not tired, said such busy let him feel very full.
两人只在大年三十那天见了一次面，钟欣去医院给彭银华送日用品，东西放在医院住院部放下就离开，彭银华来取的时候，夫妻俩面对面站着，隔着两三百米的距离通电话，那时候的彭银华戴着口罩和帽子，看不清表情，二人在电话里相互打气，钟欣远远地给他比“V”，是胜利的手势。
They met only once on New Year's Eve. Zhong Xin went to the hospital to give Peng Yinhua daily necessities. When Peng Yinhua came to fetch them, the couple stood face to face, talking to each other two or three hundred meters apart.
她没想到这会是自己和丈夫的最后一次见面。
She did not expect that this would be her last meeting with her husband.
“我们什么都不要，只要人在”1月25日，彭银华身体出现了不适，“发烧、咳嗽、喘气”，他在微信上告诉钟欣。
"We don't want anything, as long as people in January 25," Peng Yinhua physical discomfort, "fever, cough, panting," he told Zhong Xin in a letter.
但彭银华的同事、江夏区第一人民医院发热重症病区的医生胡珺猜测：“他可能1月23、24日就有点不舒服，但是到25日才重视，过来住院，当时有点发烧、干咳，查了肺部CT有比较典型的病灶”。
But Hu Jun, a doctor with fever in the First People's Hospital in Jiangxia area, guessed that: "He may have had some trouble with January 23-24, but it was not until January 25 that he arrived in hospital with a fever, dry cough and typical pulmonary CT findings."
随后彭银华在江夏区第一人民医院住院治疗，并在1月28日的第二次核酸检测中被确诊。
Peng Yinhua was hospitalized at the First People's Hospital in Jiangxia and was diagnosed with a second nucleic acid test on January 28.
“其实他在江夏第一人民医院治疗的时候状态还可以，说话、神智都清楚”，钟欣说，2月9日以后，彭银华在金银潭医院病情恶化，陷入深度昏迷，钟欣心里万分着急，每天都会往医院打电话详细询问。
"In fact, when he was treated at the First People's Hospital in Jiangxia, he was in a good state of mind and speech," Zhong said. "After February 9, Peng Yinhua became very ill and fell into a deep coma.

“我们第一次得知消息是医院在2月10日告知病危，11日我们得知重危”，彭银华姐姐在接受媒体采访时表示，“医院问我们有什么要求。
"We learned for the first time that the hospital had told us on February 10 that we were in serious danger," she told reporters.
我们什么都不要，只要人在！”亲人们都很少把彭银华和最坏的结果联系在一起，“他那么年轻，身体壮实”。
We don't want anything, as long as people are around! "Relatives rarely associate Peng Yinhua with the worst results." He's so young and strong. "
但最坏的消息还是来了。
But the worst is yet to come.
2月20日，钟欣接到了两个来自金银潭医院的电话。
On February 20, Zhong received two telephone calls from the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital.
第一个电话是在下午3:50，电话里说，已经在紧急抢救了。
The first call came at 3: 50 p.m., and the call said it was in an emergency.
钟欣曾经是江夏区第一人民医院的护士，“心里已经有杆秤了”，但因为怀着6月身孕，她试图极力平稳情绪，就像他们之前相互鼓励的一样。
Zhong Xin, a nurse at the First People's Hospital in Jiangxia, "already has a scale in her heart," but as she was pregnant in June, she tried to calm her mood as much as they had encouraged each other.
晚上10:18，第二个电话来了，接电话的时候，钟欣浑身颤抖，几乎难以自持。
At 10: 18 p.m., the second call came, and when she answered the phone, Zhong Xin trembled and could hardly contain herself.
电话那头的声音告诉她，彭银华走了。
The voice over the phone told her that Peng Yinhua was gone.
“憨厚的大男孩”彭银华去世的消息在深夜震惊了很多人，多数熟悉他的人，是在他去世的消息来临时，才首次知道他患病的情况。
The news of Peng Yinhua's death shocked many people in the middle of the night. Most of those who knew him were aware of his illness for the first time when the news of his death came.
人们怀念他的悼词里，“踏实”“阳光”“大男孩”这些词数度被提及。
In his eulogy, the words "steady", "sunshine" and "big boy" were mentioned several times.
在江夏区第一人民医院共事的半年里，彭银华的同事胡珺回忆：“平时都是支助中心的护士过来陪检查，但是有时候支助忙不过来，彭医生自己就主动出来，8点钟下夜班就可以走了，但是他会陪病人检查，至少花3个小时，他会承担一些本身不是他的任务。
Mr. Hu Jun, a colleague of Peng Yinhua, recalls working with the First People's Hospital in Jiangxia. "Normally the nurses from the support center come to accompany him for inspection, but sometimes when the support is too busy, Dr. Peng takes the initiative to leave the night shift at 8 o'clock.
”在彭银华还在武汉协和医院进行为期三年的规培时，医生张靖（化名）就对他印象深刻，“闷头做事，从不张扬”。
Zhang Jing, a doctor (alias), was impressed when he was still undergoing three years of planning at Wuhan Concorde Hospital.
有一年春节，二人在医院值守，两天之内收治了十几个病患，忙得焦头烂额的时候，张靖看着彭银华“跑前跑后，有条不紊，一点不慌忙”。
One Spring Festival, two people on duty in the hospital, two days to receive more than a dozen patients, busy at the time, Zhang Jing watched Pang Yinhua "after running, orderly, not in a hurry."
张靖见到彭银华的最后一面，是去年在协和医院，他来办规培的结业手续。

Peng Yinhan simple smile, told himself, "teacher, I signed Concorde and Jiangnan hospital (namely, the first people's hospital in Jiangxia District)."

In a widely circulated photo taken by a nurse after Peng Yinhua died, Peng Yinhua lay on the bed of the gold and silver pool hospital, outstretched his hand over "V."
张靖看着难言酸楚，觉得是熟悉的彭银华，“阳光、乐观，像个‘大男孩’”。
Zhang Jing looked at the difficult to say, feel familiar with Peng Yinhua, "sunshine, optimism, like a 'big boy'."
“大男孩”彭银华个子高、憨厚、能担事，在大学时期就被室友推选当了寝室长，王瑞波是彭银华在湖北科技学院就读时的大学室友，他觉得彭银华不怕“吃亏”。
"Big boy" Peng Yinhua is tall, honest, and can do things, was elected by his roommate as a dorm master in college, Wang Ruibo was a college roommate of Peng Yinhua's Hubei Institute of Technology.
在当时，寝室长的职责需要负责不少“吃亏”的活，寝室在五楼，饮用桶装水要从很远的地方购买再搬回寝室，几乎都是彭银华负责。

2014年，彭银华的父亲被诊断为脑动脉瘤和脑梗塞。
In 2014, Mr. Pang's father was diagnosed with a cerebral aneurysm and a cerebral infarction.
规培期间，大学室友经常在一起抱怨三四千元的工资过低，但王瑞波很惊讶的是，彭银华竟然能在这样的情况下挤出一些钱给父母用。
During the training period, college roommates often complained that the salary of three or four thousand yuan was too low, but Wang was surprised that Peng Yinhua could squeeze out some money for his parents under such circumstances.
妻子钟欣也提到，即使是在彭银华正式工作后，他的第一笔工资也是给了家里父母。
His wife, Zhong Xin, also mentioned that even after his formal work at Peng Yinhua, his first salary went to his parents.
二人初次相识时，彭银华是江夏区第一人民医院的医生，钟欣是护士。

二人在2017年领证结婚，但由于工作和经济原因，一直没有举办婚礼仪式。

后来，因为疫情，来不及发出的请柬被塞进了办公室的抽屉里。

When the bad news came, in Peng Yinhua's group of college roommates, known as "The Turn of the Road," former roommates swapped microphone icons for a candle. They stayed up all night, opening their group of chats from their first meeting with Peng Yinhua to the present day.
