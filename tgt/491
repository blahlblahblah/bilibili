素素武汉女孩素素，是熬过这次新型肺炎的一个幸运儿。
Su Su-Wuhan girl is a lucky person who has survived this new type of pneumonia.
她是一名普通白领，今年1月14日发现症状，1月19日确诊，随即在家隔离，因很多报道说“这种病会突然恶化”，她哭着写下了遗书。
She, an ordinary white-collar worker, was diagnosed with symptoms on January 14 and was isolated at home on January 19, after many reports that the disease would suddenly worsen, she wrote a tearful suicide note.
1月30日，她的病症全部消退，同期一起感染的妈妈，和她互相打气，自己吃药、隔离，最后也顺利治愈。
On January 30, all her symptoms subsided. Her mother, who had contracted the infection at the same time, encouraged each other, took her own medicine, isolated her, and finally cured herself.
她把自己这次的战“疫”历程写成了文章，一条获得独家授权在此全文发布。
She wrote her own "plague" of the course of the article, an exclusive authorization to be issued here in full.
她告诉我们，对于轻症患者来说，病毒其实也没那么可怕，就像感冒了一场一样，真正可怕的是病毒来临的时候，那些傲慢与偏见。
She tells us that the virus is not so terrible for people with mild illness, just as it is for a cold. The real fear is the arrogance and prejudice when the virus comes.
“愿大家历经浩劫，平安归来，一个不能少，愿人们敬畏自然，一刻不松懈。
"Wish you after the disaster, safe return, a can not be less, hope that people revere nature, do not relax for a moment.
”素素家所在的小区，离华南海鲜市场一墙之隔现在想来，我其实不能确定自己到底是哪一天感染上的。
Suzuo's neighborhood, a wall away from the seafood market in southern China, and I'm not sure which day I was infected.
1月14日之前，我没有任何症状，连普通感冒的症状也没有。
Before January 14, I did not have any symptoms, not even the symptoms of a common cold.
1月11日，我出发去上海玩了几天，1月14日是回程日，坐地铁去虹桥火车站时，突然觉得不舒服，几度站不住差点昏倒。
On January 11, I set out for Shanghai for a few days. January 14 was the return day. When I took the subway to Hongqiao Railway Station, I felt uncomfortable and nearly fainted several times.
现在回忆起来，庆幸那个时候没有人给我让座，也没有人扶我，庆幸我自己刚好带着口罩，应该没有对其他人造成影响。
In retrospect, I'm glad there was no one to give me a seat, no one to help me, glad I just wear a mask, should not affect other people.
唯一担心的，就是高铁回武汉的路上，坐在我旁边，带着三个孙儿从南通回荆州过年的一位老奶奶，我给了他们吃的零食，和一次性拖鞋，还简单聊了几句，不知道他们现在还是否安好。
The only worry is that the high-speed rail back to Wuhan, sitting next to me, with three grandchildren back from the Nantong Jingzhou old grandmother, I gave them snacks, disposable slippers, and a few simple chat, do not know whether they are still well.
现在回想起来，真的很自责，也很牵挂那位老人，如果不是连自己了解这次疫情都实在太晚了，谁会愿意做个坏人？其实当天在回武汉的路上，我母亲也跟我发消息，说自己在家里，身体有不适，发冷，头昏等，那个时候正值流感肆虐，我以为她也只是感冒了，安慰了几句，根本没有当回事。
In retrospect, I really reproved myself and worried about the old man, who would have been a bad person had she not known about the outbreak? In fact, on the way back to Wuhan that day, my mother told me that she was at home, sick, cold, dizzy and so on.
14日当晚抵达武汉，在家休息了几天。
I arrived in Wuhan on the evening of 14th and rested at home for several days.
15、16日两天状态特别差，浑身无力，无食欲，几乎没有嗅觉和味觉，好像只能识别甜味，睡觉出冷汗到全身汗湿，应该有伴随低烧，但是没太注意，不咳嗽，不流鼻涕。
15, 16 the two-day state is particularly bad, all weak, no appetite, almost no sense of smell and taste, as if only to recognize sweet, sleep cold sweat to sweat wet, should be accompanied by low fever, but not too much attention, no cough, no runny nose.
新型肺炎已按法律规定列入“乙类传染病”（包括传染性非典型肺炎、艾滋病、病毒性肝炎），按甲类传染病（包括霍乱、鼠疫）进行预防和控制。
The new type of pneumonia has been classified as "Class B infectious diseases" according to law (including infectious atypical pneumonia, AIDS and viral hepatitis), and is prevented and controlled according to Class A infectious diseases, including cholera and plague.
1月16日我刷微博，发现有人在说自己父亲得了新型肺炎没有医院收治的情况，开始有了一些警觉和关注。
January 16 I brush Weibo, found that his father had new pneumonia without hospital treatment, began to have some vigilance and concern.
也有朋友关心，让我去医院做个检查。
There are also friends who care, let me go to the hospital for an examination.
但我觉得自己平时身体好，很少感冒，虽然白天浑身无力，但睡一觉醒来，又觉得精神状态还不错，所以坚定认为自己只是小病，过两天就会好的。
However, I feel myself to be in good health, very few colds, although the daytime all weak, but sleep wake up, and feel that the state of mind is not bad, so firmly believe that they are just a minor illness, in two days will be all right.
直到19日才抱着侥幸去做了基本检查。
It was not until the 19th that a basic check-up was carried out.
去的时候下午三点，那时候医院人还不多，等到五点半，我是医生的最后几个患者之一。
It was three o'clock in the afternoon, when the hospital was still small, and at half past five, I was one of the last patients.
那个女医生简单问了几句，例如有没有发烧咳嗽等，我的回答都是症状不明显，只是想来做个检查看看而已，医生就说：那只用查个CT就可以判断出来了。
The woman asked me a few simple questions, such as whether I had a fever and cough. My answer was that the symptoms were not obvious. I just wanted to have a check-up.
等我去排队拍CT的时候才知道，跟我一样，对自己抱有怀疑的人还是特别多的，整个CT室的走廊都坐满了。
I didn't know until I was in line for a CT scan that, like me, there were a lot of people who were suspicious of me, and the entire CT room was full of hallways.
CT的结果要两个小时之后才能拿，我就先开车去汉阳接我爸。
The CT results won't be available for two hours, so I'm gonna drive to hanyang to pick up my dad.
爸爸当天从老家坐汽车来武汉，带了一蛇皮袋子的年味腊货和特产，我当时身体已经开始无力、虚弱了，所以接到他以后，也没有下车帮他搬东西，也没说太多话，直接把他送回了家，晚饭也没来得及吃，就自己去医院拿结果了。
My father came to Wuhan the same day by car from his hometown, with a snake-skin bag of waxy wares and specialties. I began to feel weak and weak, so when I received him, I did not get out of the car to help him carry things, without saying too much, sent him home without dinner, he went to the hospital to get the results.
素素事后向朋友描述自己当时的情况回到医院，我看到有的人拿到CT结果，兴高采烈地走了，有的人还在排队焦急等待。
Suzuo later described his situation to friends back to the hospital, I saw some people get CT results, happily left, some people are still waiting in line.
轮到我时将近晚上九点了，我看到片子上写着“右下肺部有感染性病变”，简直不敢相信自己的眼睛。
It was almost 9 pm when it was my turn, and I could hardly believe my eyes when I saw it read "Infectious lesions in the right lower lung."
为了确诊，我马上回门诊继续排队，问急诊的医生。
To confirm the diagnosis, I immediately went back to the clinic to continue queuing for an emergency doctor.
那个时候，医院晚上的急诊已经很多人了，开始排长队。
By that time, the hospital's emergency room was already crowded at night, and long queues were beginning to set in.
医生看了我的片子，又问我，之前的医生怎么没有让你查血呢？我还有点懵，那个医生有点无奈，说，那你现在赶紧去查血吧，但愿你不要所有的结果都是阴性。
The doctor looked at my film, and then asked me, before the doctor did not let you check blood? I still a little Meng, the doctor a little helpless, said, then you hasten to check blood, I hope you do not all the results are negative.
我问：为什么呢？医生说，如果结果全部是阴性，就代表你这个是新型肺炎啊！ 当时我还没有听明白是什么逻辑，等待一小时后，血液的结果也出来了，去问医生，结果那个医生下班换岗了，于是我又重新挂号，乖乖排队。
I asked: Why? The doctor said that if the results are all negative, it means you have a new type of pneumonia. I didn't understand the logic. After an hour of waiting, the blood came out and asked the doctor to change his job.
终于等到我了，换了个医生之后，估计是经验不太足，也没有给我明确答复。
Finally, when I had a new doctor, I guess I didn't have enough experience and didn't give me a definite answer.
我也不敢多问，但是那时候心里基本已经可以明确了。
I did not dare to ask more, but by that time the mind was basically clear.
1月19日真是漫长的一天。
19 January is such a long day.
我回到家，发现爸爸妈妈已经睡着了，我赶紧让爸爸起床，单独到另一个房间去隔离。
When I got home and found Mom and Dad asleep, I quickly got Dad out of bed and went to the other room to be isolated.
估计爸爸那个时候都是蒙的，第二天还照常说肚子饿要起床弄早饭，跟我们用一个卫生间。
Dad was supposed to be blindsided at the time, and the next day he said he was hungry to get up for breakfast and use a bathroom with us.
我觉得大家同住不妥，就命令他赶紧撤离回老家去，不要待在武汉了。
I felt that it was inappropriate for everyone to live together, so I ordered him to leave home quickly and not stay in Wuhan.
同时，我也非常担心妈妈的情况，她比我感冒更早。
At the same time, I was also very worried about my mother, who caught a cold earlier than I did.
那几天她也没有表现出异常，甚至还在坚持上班和做家务。
She did not show any signs of abnormality in those days, and even insisted on going to work and doing housework.
爸爸回家那天，她还做了晚饭。
On the day Dad came home, she also cooked dinner.
新闻上说，只有金银潭医院集中收治各医院的发热病人，我就赶紧带着妈妈去金银潭医院。
The news said that only the gold and silver pool hospital centralized hospital treatment of fever patients, I hastened to take my mother to gold and silver pool hospital.
到了医院才知道，医院根本不会接待自己来的住院病人。
Only on arrival did the hospital know that it would not receive its own inpatients at all.
当天我依旧浑身无力，让妈妈自己做CT和查血。
On the same day I was still limp, let my mother do CT and blood tests.
果然不出所料，妈妈也基本确诊了，而且是双肺感染。
Sure enough, mother also basically diagnosed, and is a two-lung infection.
素素母亲的检验报告单在等待结果的时候，我亲眼目睹了另一家人也带着自己患病的家人，寻求医院收留住院，因为整个武汉的医院都跑遍了，都不收，而且他们病情已经很严重了，可是，医院能做的，也只能安抚，劝离。
While waiting for the results of my mother's examination report, I saw another family with their sick family and sought admission to the hospital because the whole Wuhan hospital had run all over the place, and they were already very ill, but what the hospital could do was calm and dissuade.
我拖着衰弱无力的身体，带着妈妈离开了这家医院，依旧回到了我们家附近的新华医院。
I dragged the weak body, with her mother left the hospital, still returned to our home near the Xinhua Hospital.
我那时候是非常希望妈妈能住上院的，因为从CT结果来看她更严重，而且老人家，毕竟身体机能会差一些。
I really wanted my mother to stay in the Upper House, because the CT showed that she was more serious, and the elderly, after all, would be less able to function.
这个时候，医院已经明显比前一天更满了。
By this time the hospital was noticeably more full than the day before.
很多人因为排队太久，开始出现负面情绪。
Many people start to feel negative because they wait in line too long.
我把我和母亲的结果都拿出来给医生看的时候，年轻医生经验不足，找来了主任，主任看了明确表示，就是感染了新型肺炎，因为没有核酸试剂，只能从CT和排查已知病毒来做诊断。
When I showed the results of my mother and myself to the doctor, the young doctor, inexperienced, called the director, who made it clear that he was infected with a new form of pneumonia, since there was no nucleic acid reagent and the diagnosis could only be made from CT and the screening of known viruses.
他告诉我们，这个时候所有的医院都不可能有病床，最好的办法就是回家自行隔离，之后的输液也不用输了，因为这个病没有特效药，吃点开的药（抗甲乙流的奥司他韦和抗生素莫西沙星片）可以有一些辅助作用。
He told us that it was impossible for all hospitals to have beds at that time and that the best way to do so was to go home and isolate themselves. There was no need to lose the infusion after that, because there was no specific drug for the disease, and some complementary action could be taken (oseltamivir and moxifloxacin tablets).
当时我明显能感觉诊室外人群的骚动和紧张，估计来自于医生对新型肺炎的确诊。
I was clearly able to sense the commotion and nervousness of people outside the room, presumably because of the doctors diagnosis of the new pneumonia.
那个时候，我竟然反而一点也不紧张了，因为那么多人都是想来确诊的，跟我们一样的可能至少一半吧……人的本能就是：如果大家都一样的话，事情好像就显得没那么可怕。
At the time, I wasn't nervous at all, because so many people wanted to be diagnosed, maybe at least half as much as us... The human instinct is that if everyone is the same, things don't seem so terrible.
1月20日，素素陪妈妈打针，一直等到晚上六点当天陪妈妈打最后一针，整个输液区也坐满了，看到朋友圈里的很多人都还是用开玩笑的心态在对待这个疫情，我就把自己的情况如实记录，发了一个朋友圈，让我的朋友们引起警觉。
January 20, vegetarian with her mother injection, until 6 p.m. to accompany her mother to make the last shot, the entire infusion area is full, to see many people in the circle of friends are still joke about this epidemic, I record their own facts, a circle of friends, let my friends arouse alarm.
没有想到这个朋友圈引起了如此大的骚动，一个小时内，满城的微信群都传开了，甚至传到了外省，我的手机信息瞬间都爆炸了。
Unexpectedly this circle of friends caused such a commotion that, within an hour, the whole town of micro-letters spread, even to the provinces, my mobile phone messages exploded in an instant.
我当时因为身体和心理的双重压力，不想一一浏览和回复消息，就把这条朋友圈删除了。
I did not want to browse and reply to each other because of physical and psychological pressure, so I deleted the circle of friends.
可能大多数人那时都认为，疫情离自己还很遥远，他们也根本不知道现在医院的真实情况到了什么地步。
Most people probably believed that the epidemic was still far away and that they had no idea what the real situation was like at the hospital.
我当天从医院回家后在楼下药店买药，主动提醒柜员小姐一定要戴口罩，旁边一位男士嘲笑我说搞得太过于紧张，直到我说我自己已经确诊了，他还以为我是在开玩笑。
When I got home from the hospital and bought medicine at the drugstore downstairs, I volunteered to remind the lady teller to wear a mask. A man next to me sneered at me for being too nervous until I said I had diagnosed myself and he thought I was joking.
从1月20日晚上开始，才是真正感受到了大家的重视和紧张。
From the night of January 20, it is really feel everyone's attention and tension.
医院的问题开始凸显和受到重视，各个政策消息也随之而来，钟南山院士发言证实人传人，终于，大家都开始正视和应对这一切了。
Hospital problems began to highlight and attach importance to a variety of policy messages, Zhong Nan Shan academician spoke to confirm the human-to-human, finally, everyone began to face and deal with all of this.
随后，我经历了人生中最为惨淡的大年三十。
Then, I went through the most miserable year of my life.
再没有催婚，再没有亲人的团聚，再没有丰盛的年饭，再没有亲人的围绕和拜年祝福，只有满满的恐惧和不安，甚至是整夜的失眠。
There is no further marriage, no family reunion, no sumptuous New Year dinner, no family around and blessing, only full of fear and uneasiness, even insomnia all night.
素素说，这是她和妈妈“大年三十的盛宴”一边哭，一边写好了留给妹妹的遗书，后悔自己还有很多都来不及去做的事，一整夜都在回忆自己短暂美好的前半生，生怕自己像有些报道里说的，双肺都突然白了，随时呼吸困难，随时有生命危险，随时会离开这个美丽的世界……素素当时写的遗书我哭的时候是偷偷哭的，因为妈妈的检查结果跟我比起来更严重，我不想影响到她。
Suzuo said that this is her mother and "New Year's Eve banquet" while crying, while writing a suicide note, regret that there are too many things to do, all night long memories of their short happy first half of life, afraid of their sudden white lungs, breathing difficulties, life threatening to leave this beautiful world.
她年纪大一点，也没有加什么群，收不到与疫情相关的负面或者让人恐惧的信息，这种信息我也没有传达给她。
She was older, she had no group, she didn't get any negative or scary information about the epidemic, and I didn't get it to her.
整个隔离的过程中，她的心态都非常平和，基本上就是我让她检查，让她打针，回家隔离，消毒，等等，全部都是听从我的嘱咐和安排，从头到尾都没有任何沮丧。
Throughout the isolation, her state of mind was very peaceful, basically I let her check, let her injection, home isolation, disinfection, and so on, all at my command and arrangement, from beginning to end without any frustration.
在家隔离的日子，我每天都在关注疫情的进展和来自全国人民的幽默，一边也做着自我的心理疏导，时间过得挺快的。
During the days of isolation at home, I watched the progress of the epidemic and the humor from all over the country every day.
因为失去味觉和食欲，我吃不下任何东西，不知不觉瘦了五六斤，也是这几年来第一次成功恢复到了93斤的理想体重。
I couldn't eat anything because I lost my sense of taste and appetite. I lost five or six pounds, and for the first time in several years I managed to regain my ideal weight of 93 pounds.
1月26日晚上开始，我明显感觉自己食欲有点恢复了。
From the evening of January 26, it became apparent that I had regained some appetite.
十多天以来，第一次主动想去找点吃的填肚子，夜里去厨房捞了点吃的，竟然异常开心和满足。
For the first time in more than ten days, I wanted to find some food to fill my stomach. I fished up some food in the kitchen at night.
恢复味觉的那一刻，仿佛自己如获新生。
The moment I regained my sense of taste, I felt as if I had been born.
我妈妈发病和恢复过程基本和我同步。
My mother's illness and recovery process is basically the same as mine.
归纳一下起病的症状：1、无味觉和食欲，甚至想吐；2、畏寒，伴随肌肉酸痛无力甚至哆嗦，睡觉冒冷汗；3、头昏，无力，类似于感冒；4、初期（前一周）肺里有痰，刚开始白色，中期（起病10天左右）绿色，带血丝，甚至布满血丝，后期（15天左右）血丝消失，痰也慢慢消失。
1, taste and appetite, even nausea; 2, cold, accompanied by muscle pain weak or even shiver, sleep cold sweat; 4, early (previous week) lung phlegm, just beginning white, mid (about 10 days of illness) green, bloodshot, even bloodshot, later (15 days or so) blood trail disappears and sputum slowly disappears.
患这个新型肺炎，有的人是不会发烧的，比如我和妈妈全程几乎没有发烧过。
With the new pneumonia, some people do not have a fever, such as my mother and I almost did not have a fever.
重症病人基本都会发烧，但大多数人都是轻症，初期四五天身体病症感觉比较明显，后面病症其实就不太明显了。
The patients with severe fever, but most of them are mild, the first four or five days of physical symptoms feel more obvious, the latter symptoms are not so obvious.
一旦食欲恢复，体力恢复，基本就可以宣布抗战胜利。
Once appetite is restored and physical strength restored, the victory in the war of resistance can be declared.
我爸爸因为隔离及时，回老家十多天以来，没有出现任何症状，免于感染。
My father because of isolation in time, back home for more than 10 days, did not appear any symptoms, avoid infection.
素素和妈妈在家隔离时吃的药，莲花清瘟是自己买的，奥司他韦和莫西沙星是医生开的这几天，我充当着网上咨询的角色，很多人自己或者家人朋友被感染了，都过来寻医问药，找寻经验，我一一做回复解答，我想告诉大家的是：1、在没有核酸试剂确诊的情况下，CT片和传染已知病毒排查，基本99%就可以断定。
In the past few days, I have been acting as an online consultant. Many people have been infected with themselves or their family and friends, and they have come to seek medical treatment and experience.
因为核酸试剂很少，应用的硬件要求也很高，除了重症患者之外，几乎不可能用这种方式确诊。
Because nucleic acid reagents are few and the hardware requirements for their application are high, it is virtually impossible to diagnose in this way, except in cases of severe illness.
我身边带着症状来问诊的人，没有一个有机会通过核酸试剂来确诊。
None of the people I visited with symptoms had an opportunity to be diagnosed with a nucleic acid reagent.
我自己目前已经抗战病毒半个多月了，虽然在医院前台登记过病情，但也没有在这个上报的名单之列。
I myself have been fighting the virus for more than half a month now, and although I have registered my illness at the front desk, I am not on the list.
2、一去医院就能得到你想要的诊治在现阶段其实应该是很难实现的，医生们接诊的压力也是非常巨大的。
2. Get the treatment you want as soon as you go to the hospital. At this stage, it should be very difficult to achieve.
不如做好自我抗战的心理准备，况且，医院各种排队，对于带病疑似的你，身体更难受，不如在家里休养。
Better to prepare for the war of self-resistance, and, besides, the various hospital lines, the suspected illness of you, the body is more uncomfortable, better at home rest.
3、这个病大部分轻症患者怎么治？一句话，就靠自己的抵抗力。
3, this disease how to treat the majority of light disease patient? In a word, depend on own resistance.
没有对症的药，最好的药，就是自己的心态。
There is no right medicine, the best medicine, is their own mentality.
想想这十多天来，心态好的时候，都不觉得自己在治病，该吃饭就吃饭，该喝药喝药，刷刷手机，挺轻松，也利于身体机能恢复。
Think of these more than 10 days, when the state of mind is good, do not feel in the treatment of illness, should eat, drink medicine, brush mobile phones, very relaxed, but also conducive to physical recovery.
可是当你一直盯着负面消息，紧张得不行，仿佛自己随时面临生命的尽头，吃不下，也睡不好，到处查症状，传播那些制造恐怖气氛的不良信息。
But when you keep staring at negative news, you're so nervous that you seem to be at the end of your life, unable to eat or sleep well, sniffing around for symptoms and spreading bad messages that create a climate of fear.
现在想想，过于紧张和消极，才是抵抗病情最大的阻碍。
Now think about it, too much stress and negativity is the greatest resistance to the disease.
4、一定要做好预防，不要以为病毒离自己很远，最好养成日常消毒的习惯。
4, must do well to prevent, do not think the virus is far from themselves, had better form the habit of daily disinfection.
现在我家里角角落落每天都紫外线车消毒一次，84喷洒，酒精擦拭，碗筷每天开水烫。
Now I disinfect every nook and cranny of my house every day, 84 spray it, wipe it with alcohol and use chopsticks to boil water every day.
出门时也随身携带酒精，喷洒触摸到的物品。
Take alcohol with you when you go out and spray what you touch.
经过了这16天的抗战，已经胜利在望，很多人问我感受，其实我想跟大家说的是不要怕，这个病其实并没有想象中那么可怕。
After 16 days of resistance, victory is in sight. Many people ask me how I feel. In fact, what I want to tell you is don't be afraid.
传染速度确实快，但是对生命的威胁程度并没有那么大，最可怕的其实是自己面对未知病毒的恐慌和想象，而不是病毒本身。
Infection is rapid, but the threat to life is not so great, the most terrible is their own fear of the unknown virus and imagination, not the virus itself.
虽然在抗战的结尾，我们也有太多疑问，比如：康复后会不会有抗体？短期或者长期会不会再次被感染或者再复发？什么时候才会有预防药物？什么时候这场战役宣告结束？……我们作为这次疫情先头部队太想知道，这也是我们所有人即将要面对的问题。
Although at the end of the War of Resistance, we also have too many questions, such as: Will there be antibodies after recovery? Will there be re-infection or relapse in the short or long term? When will there be prophylactic drugs? When will the campaign be declared over?.. We are too eager to know as the vanguard of this epidemic that we are all about to face.
素素愈后进行了网络咨询这些天来，我感受到了整个世界的浓浓爱意。
The more vegetarian after the network consultation these days, I feel the love of the whole world.
有的朋友发来大额的拜年红包，有的同事不知道从哪里听闻我断药了，药店都关门了满城买不到药，还各显神通帮我弄到了药品，还有的朋友冒着风险送来口罩物资……看着网上对湖北地域的各种谩骂，我真的觉得挺好笑。
Some friends sent large red envelopes, some colleagues do not know where to hear I cut off drugs, pharmacies closed the city can not buy medicine, and every god help me to get medicine, and some friends risk sending masks material... Looking at the various online abuse Hubei region, I really feel funny.
这次疫情，武汉人做了很大的牺牲，也背了很大的黑锅。
This outbreak, Wuhan people made a great sacrifice, but also carried a large black pot.
水深火热的武汉人真的没有精力和时间回怼你们，但不代表较真起来我们会输。
The fiery Wuhan people really do not have the energy and time to resent you, but it does not mean that we will lose.
同时，我也注意到朋友圈有其他朋友治愈的好消息，那个朋友的妈妈比我和妈妈症状严重，在医院辗转20多天终于得救。
At the same time, I noticed the good news that other friends in the circle of friends were cured. The friend's mother and I had severe symptoms and were finally saved after tossing and turning in the hospital for more than 20 days.
素素朋友的母亲的抗“疫”经历，她的症状比素素母女都严重很多当你经历一次与死神擦肩而过之后，真的，那一刻起，会对所有的事都释然，能健康的活着，比什么都重要。
Suzuo friend's mother's anti-" epidemic "experience, her symptoms than vegetarian mother and daughter are much more serious When you experience a brush with death, really, from that moment on, all things will be released, can live healthily, than anything else.
如果不经历失去，谁会知道重逢有多么美好？隔离在家的这么多天，我才发现，天天躺着并没有那么让人梦寐以求。
If I don't experience loss, who knows how great it is to reunite? After all these days in seclusion, I find it is not so dreamy to lie down every day.
只有对社会有贡献，能发挥自己的能量，才是生命最大的意义。
The greatest meaning of life is to contribute to the society and exert your energy.
我以前没有意识到，快递、环卫工人、小区卫生人员，超市收银员、出租车司机等等这些基层的服务工作者这么被需要，甚至可以说，一天都离不开他们。
I didn't realize how much people at the grassroots level - express delivery, sanitation workers, neighborhood health workers, supermarket cashiers, taxi drivers - were needed, or so it was, for a day.
我甚至也没有意识到，那些一线的医务工作者，他们对于生命的守护的意义。
I did not even realize the significance of the frontline medical workers in their defense of life.
在与死神搏斗的真正关头，他们冲在我们的前面。
They rushed in front of us in the real moment of their struggle with death.
还有那些愿意贡献自己力量的志愿者们，你们是人群中最耀眼的光！素素和同事们自发组织捐赠医用物资这个时候，才真正理解那句：人人为我，我为人人！希望我们一起共同努力，让社会早日恢复常态，毕竟没有几个人不是背负诸如房贷车贷父母孩子等沉重的生活压力的。
And those who are willing to contribute their own strength, you are the most dazzling light in the crowd! Suzuo and colleagues spontaneously organized donations of medical supplies, I really understand the sentence: Everyone for me, I for everyone! I hope we can work together to restore normal society as soon as possible, after all, few people are not burdened with the stress of life such as mortgage loan parents and children.
武汉只不过不小心成为了大自然给人类警告的一页教科书。
Wuhan has become only a page of environmental warning to mankind by accident.
这并不是武汉一个城市的错，我们每一个人都有义务和责任，去铭记和承担这个教训。
Wuhan is not the fault of a city, we each have the duty and responsibility to remember and bear this lesson.
致死率是本次疫情中人们最关心的问题之一，最近网上也陆续出现一些治愈病患的口述经历。
The fatality rate is one of the most concerned problems in this epidemic. Recently, some oral experiences of curing patients have appeared on the Internet.
2月4日，国家卫健委举行新闻发布会，公布了此次新型肺炎截至目前的死亡率数据：全国确诊病例病死率2.1%，湖北省确诊病例病死率3.1%，武汉市确诊病例病死率4.9%。
The mortality rate for the new type of pneumonia so far is 2.1 percent, 3.1 percent in Hubei province and 4.9 percent in Wuhan, according to a press conference held by the National Health Commission on February 4.
武汉市的病死率为什么比其他地方高？新闻发布会上，专家分析，一个主要原因是病情爆发集中，床位资源不够。
