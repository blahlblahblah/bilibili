一则好消息：儿童或在新冠疫情中幸免于难。
One piece of good news: children may have survived the new crown.
迄今尚未看到儿童因新冠病毒感染而死亡的报道。
No deaths of children from the new crown virus have been reported so far.
据中国疾控中心 2 月 17 日数据，在确诊的 44672 例患者中有 0.9% 为 9 岁以下婴幼儿，约为 400 例；19 岁以下患者占比 2.1%，938 例左右。
Of the 44,672 cases diagnosed, 0.9 percent were infants under 9 years of age, or about 400 cases, and 2.1 percent, or 938 cases, were under 19 years of age, according to China's CDC February 17.
此前的不完全统计显示，全国儿童确诊病例中 26.8% 有疫源地暴露史，71.2% 有明确的感染家庭聚集史。
Previous incomplete statistics showed that 26.8 per cent of confirmed cases of childhood infection nationwide had a history of exposure and 71.2 per cent had a clear history of familial infection.
可见家庭内密切接触是儿童感染新冠病毒的主要方式。
Close contact within the family is the main way for children to become infected with the new crown virus.

在确诊的 44672 例患者中有 0.9% 为 9 岁以下婴幼儿。
Of the 44,672 cases diagnosed, 0.9 per cent were children under 9 years of age.
（来源：China CDC Weekly）专家认为，从全国疫情分布看，儿童病例报告数有增多趋势，主要原因有疫情逐渐进入高峰、家庭聚集病例发病多、病原检测逐渐普及等，但轻症感染例数占比更高。
(Source: China CDC Weekly) Experts say the number of reported cases of children is on the rise across the country, mainly because of the gradual peak of the epidemic, the high incidence of family agglomerations and the gradual spread of pathogen testing, but the incidence of mild infections is higher.
相对成人而言，重症患者比例在儿童患者中低了许多。
The proportion of severe cases among children is much lower than among adults.
临床一线很是重视在此次疫情中的儿童群体。
The clinical front is very focused on the children in this epidemic group.
中华医学会儿科学分会、《中华儿科杂志》编辑委员会在线发表了《儿童 2019 新型冠状病毒感染的诊断与防治建议(试行第一版)》指导临床合理诊疗。
The Chinese Medical Association Pediatrics Section and the Chinese Journal of Pediatrics published online the "Children 2019 New Coronavirus Infection Diagnosis and Treatment (Trial Version 1)" to guide clinical rational diagnosis and treatment.
近期各地也相继发布一系列的相关指南和建议。
Recently, a series of related guidelines and recommendations have been issued in various places.
症状轻微285 例全国报告儿童确诊病例中统计了 134 例确诊儿童病例的临床表现：病情大多较轻，恢复较快，预后良好；发热和咳嗽较为常见，还有乏力、肌痛、鼻塞、咽痛、头痛、恶心、呕吐、腹痛和腹泻等表现，多在 1 周内消失。
The clinical manifestations of 134 confirmed cases of children were recorded in 285 cases with mild symptoms nationwide. Most cases were mild, recovery was faster and the prognosis was good. Fever and cough were more common, and symptoms such as fatigue, muscle pain, stuffy nose, sore throat, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea disappeared within 1 week.
在 117 例有体温记录患儿中，89 例 (76.1%) 有发热(高热 11 例，中低热 17 例，数据不详者 61 例；热程多为 1 天到 2 天；热程最长 8 天，热峰达 40.2 ℃)。
Of the 117 cases with documented body temperature, 89 cases (76.1 per cent) had fever (11 cases of high fever, 17 cases of moderate and low fever, 61 cases with unknown data; heat journey of 1 to 2 days; maximum heat journey of 8 days and heat peak of 40.2 ° C).
无症状感染 9 例(6.7%)；轻型 87 例(64.9%)；普通型 36 例(26.9%，包括 7 例亚临床型)；危重型 2 例(1.5%)，有创机械通气，均有基础疾病史。
There were 9 cases of asymptomatic infection (6.7%), 87 cases of light (64.9%), 36 cases of common type (26.9%, including 7 subclinical types), 2 cases of critical type (1.5%), invasive mechanical ventilation, history of basic diseases.
来自上海的专家建议说，儿童新冠感染者中，发热咳嗽是常见的症状，但要注意合并的消化道症状，腹泻和呕吐。
Experts from Shanghai say fever and coughing are common symptoms among children infected with the new crown, but note the combination of digestive symptoms, diarrhea and vomiting.
儿童与成人患者临床表现、病程、转归存在一定差异，其机制尚不清楚。
There are some differences in clinical manifestation, course and prognosis between children and adult patients. The mechanism is unclear.
专家强调指出，儿童病例多以无症状和轻型感染为主，不能因为临床症状轻微或者不典型，造成新冠病毒感染的漏诊和误诊。
Experts stress that cases of children are mostly asymptomatic and light-duty infections and should not be misdiagnosed or misdiagnosed as a result of mild or atypical clinical symptoms.
此外，由于儿童病例轻症为主，胸部 CT 缺乏特异性，很难单纯依靠胸部 CT 做出明确的诊断，所以 CT 和核酸检测应协同并互为补充。
In addition, the lack of specificity of thoracic CT due to the predominance of mild cases in children makes it difficult to make a clear diagnosis based solely on thoracic CT, so CT and nucleic acid testing should complement each other.
在病毒核酸检测中，儿童由于气道结构特点及上皮细胞功能与成人不同，纤毛清除能力低的原因亦可能是检出率低的因素。
In the detection of viral nucleic acid, because airway structure and epithelial cell function are different from those of adults, the reason of low cilia removal ability may also be a factor of low detection rate.
对于轻症患者、高度疑似患者或有密切接触史者，标本采集优选顺序为鼻咽拭子、口咽拭子、痰液。
For light patients, highly suspected patients or those with close contact with history, the priority order of sample collection is nasopharyngeal swab, oral pharynx swab and phlegm fluid.
图 | 2 月 13 日，经过两个多星期治疗，国内确诊的首例危重型新冠肺炎患儿康复出院。
On 13 February, after more than two weeks of treatment, the country's first confirmed case of severe neonatal pneumonia recovered and was discharged.
该名患儿家住武汉市黄陂区，年仅 1 岁 2 个多月，1 月 26 日下午因间断腹泻、呕吐 6 天，外院治疗后仍精神萎靡、食欲欠佳，尿量少，呼吸急促，被紧急送入武汉儿童医院重症医学科隔离病房救治。
The patient, who lives in Huangpi District, Wuhan City, is one year old and over 2 months old. He was sent to Wuhan Children's Hospital for emergency medical isolation on January 26 afternoon due to intermittent diarrhea and vomiting for 6 days.
（来源：新华社）武汉儿童医院重症医学科张芙蓉等人报道了中国首例儿童危重型患者。
(Source: Xinhua) Zhang Furong, an intensive care specialist at Wuhan Children's Hospital, reported the first case of a critically ill child in China.
1 岁的患儿以消化道症状起病，早期呼吸道症状不明显，快速进展为急性呼吸窘迫综合征、脓毒症休克并伴有急性肾衰竭。
1-year-old children with gastrointestinal symptoms, early respiratory symptoms are not obvious, rapid progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis shock with acute renal failure.
患儿前两次咽拭子核酸检测均为阴性，直到发病第 13 天第 3 次核酸检测才阳性。
The first two pharyngeal swab nucleic acid tests were negative, until the 13th day of the onset of nucleic acid test positive.
对于患儿早期核酸检测阴性，张芙蓉等人推测，除了可能与患儿标本采集和检测方法有关外，还可能与患儿年幼、免疫功能较弱、感染早期病毒载量较低有关。
Negative for early detection of nucleic acids, Zhang and others speculate that in addition to possible association with specimen collection and testing methods, it may also be related to the child's young age, weak immune function and low viral load.
此外，患儿 B 超提示肾积水，不能排除存在先天性肾积水可能。
In addition, the child B super-suggestive hydronephrosis, can not exclude the existence of congenital hydronephrosis.
新生儿确诊据武汉儿童医院刘智胜等人报道，中国首例新生儿新型冠状病毒感染者为男婴，17 日龄，因 “打喷嚏，伴间断吐奶 1 周”，于 2020 年 2 月 5 日入住武汉儿童医院新生儿内科隔离病房。
Wuhan Children's Hospital Liu Zhisheng and others reported that the first case of a new type of coronary virus in China was a baby boy, 17 days old, who was admitted to the neonatal isolation ward of Wuhan Children's Hospital on February 5, 2020 due to "sneezing with intermittent spitting for a week.
入院前 1 周患儿出现打喷嚏，伴有吐奶，无发热、咳嗽及喘息等表现。
Children sneezed 1 week before admission, with vomiting, no fever, cough and wheezing.
病程中精神反应下降，吃奶量减少，排尿排粪均正常。
During the course of the disease, mental reaction decreased, reduced the amount of milk, urine excretion are normal.
2 月 7 日咽拭子核酸检测阳性，未做肛拭子核酸检测；2 月 8 日咽拭子和肛拭子核酸检测均阳性；2 月 9 日咽拭子核酸检测阴性，肛拭子核酸检测阳性。
On 7 February, the pharyngeal swab tested positive for nucleic acid; on 8 February, the pharyngeal swab and the anal swab were tested positive; on 9 February, the pharyngeal swab negative and the anal DNA test positive.
患儿入院后进入新生儿内科隔离病房观察治疗，给予温箱保暖隔离，密切监测心率、呼吸、血压、血糖、出入量等，进行对症支持治疗（维生素 K1 及补液等）。
After admission, the child is admitted to the neonatal internal medicine ward for observation and treatment. The incubator is kept warm and isolated. The child is closely monitored for heart rate, respiration, blood pressure, blood sugar, inlet and outlet.
患儿入院后第 1、2 天有呕吐表现，第 3 天开始缓解，吃奶好，第 4 天有一过性体温 37.8 摄氏度，同时伴有腹泻，一日 6 次黄色稀粪，加用蒙脱石散口服后次日恢复正常。
The children had vomiting on the first and second days after admission, remission on the third day, good feeding, 37.8 degrees Celsius of transient body temperature on the fourth day, accompanied by diarrhea, 6 times a day yellow dung, plus montmorillonite powder after oral administration returned to normal the next day.
病程中无咳嗽，精神食欲较好，生命体征稳定，尿量正常。
During the course of the disease there is no cough, good mental appetite, stable signs of life, normal urine volume.
入院 7 天后无呕吐、发热、咳嗽及呼吸困难表现，精神食欲好，无异常体征。
There was no vomiting, fever, cough and dyspnea 7 days after admission.
患儿父母均为新冠确诊患者。
The parents of the children were confirmed by the new crown.
结合患儿临床表现，提示存在呼吸道和消化道同时感染可能。
Combined with the clinical manifestation of the child, it suggested the possibility of respiratory tract and alimentary tract infection.
作者提示说，需警惕在家庭护理中，如喂养等环节，用具消毒不充分及看护人员手部卫生欠缺引起经口传播可能，但也不排除与新生儿长期卧位，呼吸道分泌物下咽有关。
The authors suggest that caution should be exercised in home care, such as feeding links, inadequate disinfection of appliances and lack of hygiene in the hands of caregivers may cause oral transmission, but do not rule out long-term positioning of the newborn, respiratory secretions and hypopharynx.
此前在 30 小时新生儿确诊新冠感染的新闻报道之后，很多人担心新冠病毒是否存在母婴垂直传播。
Many feared vertical transmission of the new crown virus after news reports of a 30-hour newborn confirmed the infection.
如果存在母婴垂直传播的话，那么确诊孕妇要不要终止妊娠就成了要抉择的选项。
If there is vertical mother-to-child transmission, then the choice is whether or not to terminate the pregnancy.
《柳叶刀》（The Lancet）于 2 月 12 日在线发表一项来自武汉关于妊娠晚期合并新型冠状病毒肺炎的小样本研究。
The Lancet online Feb. 12 published a study from Wuhan on a small sample of late pregnancy complicated by a new coronavirus pneumonia.
研究称，目前尚无证据表明新冠病毒感染可导致母婴间垂直传播。
There is no evidence that new crown virus infection causes vertical mother-to-child transmission, the study said.
专家表示，目前不能确定是否有母胎垂直传播，孕母有疑似或确诊感染的新生儿应隔离至少 14 天，在此期间不推荐直接母乳喂养，直到排除或治愈新冠病毒感染后才可行母乳喂养。
Experts say it is not possible to determine whether a mother-to-child transmission is vertical, and that a newborn with a suspected or confirmed infection in a pregnant mother should be isolated for at least 14 days, during which time direct breastfeeding is not recommended until after the new crown virus infection has been eliminated or cured.
为何儿童症状更轻为何儿童感染新冠病毒后症状更轻？目前尚无明确解释。
There is no clear explanation as to why children have less severe symptoms when they become infected with the new crown virus.
世界卫生组织总干事谭德塞在 2 月 17 日的通报会上表示，统计显示，随着年龄的增长，死亡的风险也会增加。
Statistics show that the risk of death also increases with age, WHO Director-General Theresa Tupper said in a briefing on Feb. 17.
人们看到儿童病例相对较少，这需要开展更多的研究来解释其中的原因。
The relatively small number of cases seen among children calls for more research to explain why.
据 BBC 和纽约时报报道，科学家更加倾向于认为，对于已患有疾病的成年人来说，其免疫系统承受很大压力，其中包括糖尿病或心脏病患者，他们往往更容易受到此类疫情的影响。
According to the BBC and the New York Times, scientists are more likely to believe that adults who already have a disease and whose immune systems are severely stressed, including those with diabetes or heart disease, are often more vulnerable to such outbreaks.
也就是说，由于成人已有其他病症，因此受到疫情影响比儿童更严重，比如水痘发生在成年人身上更加危险。
That is, because adults already have other conditions, they are more affected by the epidemic than children, such as chicken pox, which is more dangerous in adults.
而肺炎往往影响免疫系统虚弱的人。
Pneumonia, on the other hand, affects people with weakened immune systems.
SARS、MERS 以及其他冠状病毒的感染有相似情形，大多数被感染的儿童并未出现症状。
SARS, MERS, and other coronavirus infections are similar, with most infected children showing no symptoms.
2003 年非典疫情中也没有儿童死亡。
There were no child deaths from the 2003 SARS epidemic.
流感的情形也类似：尽管每年有成千上万的幼童因为流感入院，但死亡率很低。
The flu scenario is similar: while thousands of young children are hospitalized each year with flu, the death rate is low.
据武汉同济医院儿科学系主任罗小平等人分析，一般而言，高病毒载量通常与其致病性相关，还与感染者传染性的强弱有关。
According to Luo Xiaobiang, head of pediatrics department at Wuhan Tongji Hospital, the high viral load is usually related to the pathogenicity of the disease and the infectivity of the infected.
中国科学家确认新冠病毒进入细胞需要借助血管紧张素转化酶 2（ACE2）蛋白的存在，同时新冠病毒似乎已经进化为一种能劫持 Ⅱ 型肺泡上皮细胞以利病毒增殖与传播的病毒。
Chinese scientists have identified the presence of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) proteins as the virus enters cells, while the new canopy virus appears to have evolved into a virus that hijacks Type II alveolar epithelial cells for viral proliferation and transmission.
他们认为，因为 ACE2 蛋白在体内分布广泛，儿童对新冠病毒易感性低，科学家推测，这是否与 ACE2 蛋白的发育和功能较低或存在差异相关，或者是儿童肺泡上皮细胞内 ACE2 诱导的细胞内反应较成人低下。
Because ACE2 is widely distributed in the body and children are less susceptible to the new crown virus, the scientists speculate that this is associated with lower or differential development and function of ACE2 proteins, or that ACE2-induced intracellular responses in children's alveolar epithelial cells are lower than in adults.
此外，临床观察到，新冠病毒可消耗成人淋巴细胞，而儿童病例白细胞计数和淋巴细胞绝对数大多正常，并未发生淋巴细胞消耗现象，可能与其天然免疫发育不完善有关。
In addition, it has been observed clinically that the new crown virus can deplete adult lymphocytes, whereas in most cases leukocyte counts and absolute lymphocyte counts in children are normal, no lymphocyte consumption has occurred and may be associated with poor natural immune development.
儿童症状轻微总是好事。
Light symptoms in children are always a good thing.
但换个角度看，感染新冠病毒的儿童无症状或症状轻微是也会带来另一个担忧，即被感染且无症状的儿童会不会将病毒传染给他人，那些没有意识到自己被感染的儿童可能会助长疫情的蔓延。
On the other hand, the asymptomatic or mild symptoms of children infected with the new crown virus also raise the concern that infected and asymptomatic children will transmit the virus to others and that children who are not aware of their infection may contribute to the spread of the epidemic.
