“让病毒在英国缓慢传播，不加阻止，多数人患病后再康复，以达到群体免疫的最终目的。
"Let the virus spread slowly in the UK, unchecked, and most people recover from the disease to achieve the ultimate goal of mass immunization."
”英国首相鲍里斯·约翰逊：“新冠肺炎疫情是这一代人所面临的最严重公共卫生危机。
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson: "The new crown pneumonia epidemic is the greatest public health crisis of our generation.
”图片来源：CBS截屏英国首相鲍里斯·约翰逊3月12日召开眼镜蛇紧急计划委员会会议后宣布，英国进入抗疫的第二阶段，“延缓”（Delay）。
CBS screen capture British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced March 12 that Britain had entered the second phase of its fight against the disease, "Delay," after a meeting of the Cobra Emergency Planning Commission.
彭博社将其解读为，让病毒在英国缓慢传播，不加阻止，多数人患病后再康复，以达到群体免疫的最终目的。
Bloomberg interprets it as a slow, unchecked spread of the virus in the UK, with most people recovering from the disease to meet the ultimate goal of mass immunization.
进入“延缓”阶段后的一项新政策是,“不再给轻症病人检测”。
A new policy, coming into its "slow-down" phase, is to "no longer give light patients testing."
政府建议，所有出现咳嗽、发热等症状的人居家隔离7天，症状不严重的人不要拨打英国的111医疗咨询电话，除非症状出现恶化。
The government recommends that all people with cough, fever and other symptoms stay in their homes for seven days and people with mild symptoms should not call Britain's 111 medical consultations unless symptoms worsen.
此外，约翰逊公布的一系列举措还包括禁止学校安排学生出国旅行、建议70岁以上的老年人近期不要出行，再次强调洗手的重要性，但并未取消大规模集会，也没有关停学校。
Johnson also announced plans to ban schools from sending students abroad, advised people over 70 not to travel in the near future and re-emphasized the importance of washing their hands, but did not cancel mass gatherings or close schools.
政府认为，取消大规模集会是“最不有效”的措施之一，这只会让英国的最高病例数“减少5%”。
The government regards the cancellation of mass gatherings as one of the "least effective" measures, which would only "cut the UK's maximum number of cases by 5 per cent."
英国政府首席科学官帕特里克·瓦兰斯认为，新冠病毒很可能会变成“季节性流感般的存在”，每年都会出现，如果绝大多数人感染这种病毒后能够建立群体免疫力，那么更多的人就会因此而受益。
Patrick Varens, the UK government's chief science officer, believes the new cap virus is likely to become "seasonal flu-like," occurring every year, and more people would benefit if the vast majority became immune to the virus.
“这样我们就能够减少传播，同时保护那些脆弱的群体。
"In this way we can reduce transmission while protecting vulnerable groups.
”英国政府首席科学官帕特里克·瓦兰斯解释其群体免疫防控策略 （图片来源：SKY TV截屏）在流行病学界，群体免疫意味着一个群体中如果有相当比例的成员具有免疫能力，即可大概率地阻断感染者的二次传播，从而保护其余没有免疫能力的人群免遭感染。
Patrick Varens, the UK government's chief science officer, explains his strategy for group immunization (source: SKY TV screenshots) In epidemiology, mass immunization means that a significant proportion of members of a group are immune, which can block secondary transmission of the infection at a high probability, thus protecting the rest of the incapacitated population from infection.
英国政府的专家团队认为，如果采取非常严厉的措施，那么当解除这些措施时，疫情会反弹，也就意味着病毒可能在来年冬季再次流行，而那时英国的防疫体系已经超负荷运行一年，后果难以预料。
The British government's team of experts believes that if drastic measures are taken, the disease will bounce back when the measures are lifted, meaning the virus could return in the coming winter, when Britain's epidemic prevention system was already overloaded for a year with unpredictable consequences.
“如果你非常努力地压制某种东西，当你释放时它将会反弹，且会在错误的时间反弹。
"If you work very hard to suppress something, when you release it will bounce back and rebound at the wrong time.
”帕特里克·瓦兰斯说，“希望通过这些措施，来增强英国民众对新冠病毒的免疫力，从而减轻医疗系统的压力。
Patrick Varens said: "It is hoped these measures will reduce the pressure on the health care system by increasing people's immunity to the new Crown virus.
”3月13日，英国卫生部更新病毒检测指南，规定三类英国居民将获得检测机会：优先级最高的是需要重症监护的病患；其次是医生判断需要住院治疗的中症患者；来自学校、养老院等场所的聚集性病例感染者将在重症、中症患者之后得到检测。
On March 13, the Department of Health updated its guidelines for testing for the virus, stipulating that three categories of British residents would be given the chance to be tested: the highest priority would be patients in need of intensive care; second, doctors would judge patients in need of hospital care; and those from schools, nursing homes and other places would be tested for severe, middle-aged patients.
而出现轻微症状的患者，将无法及时获得病毒检测。
Patients with mild symptoms will not be able to get a virus test in time.
帕特里克·瓦兰斯强调，没有任何一种措施可以让所有人满意。
Patrick Varens stressed that there was no single measure that would satisfy everyone.
这只是从科学的角度上出发，目前阶段英国政府能做的、最合理、最恰当的措施，尽量拖延疫情到达顶峰的时间，与此同时也需要有人被感染并产生抗体，在今年夏天到下一个冬天到来之前，完成这一目标。
It is only from a scientific point of view, the most reasonable and appropriate measures that the British Government can take at this stage to minimize the peak of the epidemic, while at the same time requiring people to be infected and produce antibodies to do so by the summer and the next winter.
3月14日，英国卫生当局发布的最新数字显示，英国新冠肺炎确诊病例数累计已达1140例，较前一天公布的数字增加342例，累计死亡病例数较前一天翻倍，达21人。
A cumulative total of 1,140 new cases of pneumonia have been confirmed, 342 more than on the previous day and 21 more than the previous day, according to the latest figures released by the British Health Authority on March 14.
“理论是理论，实际情况还有待于观察，不同国家有不同制度、国情，应对策略有所不同。
"Theory is a theory and the actual situation remains to be seen. Different countries have different systems and national conditions and different coping strategies.
英国还有时间，如果发现不可行，会再转变措施。
Britain still has time to move on if it finds it unworkable.
” 复旦大学公共卫生学院卫生经济学教授胡善联对《中国新闻周刊》分析说。
Hu Shanlian, a professor of health economics at Fudan University School of Public Health, told China News Weekly.
但是，不同传染病病毒的群体免疫门槛有所差异。
However, there are differences in the threshold of immunization for different infectious disease viruses.
天花、麻疹等疾病需要的群体免疫比例高达80%到90%。
The proportion of the population immunized against diseases such as smallpox and measles is as high as 80 to 90 per cent.
英国政府的专家组目前认为，如果有60%的居民通过轻症感染新冠病毒后自愈或疫苗注射获得免疫能力，就可满足“群体免疫”的标准。
The British government's panel of experts now believes that if 60% of residents are immunized through mild infection with the new crown virus or vaccinated, they can meet the criteria for "mass immunization."
这一策略被网友调侃为“以身试毒”、“视死如归”，甚至有网友将其比作“麻疹排队”，这是一种流行与欧美民间的做法：家长邀请麻疹感染者和自己的小孩一起玩耍，让孩子感染麻疹，从而产生抗体。
This strategy has been ridiculed by netizens as "body test poison," "see death as dead", and even some netizens liken it to "measles queues," a popular practice with European and American folk: parents invite measles-infected children to play with their own children, and thus produce antibodies.
群体免疫门槛的计算取决于病毒基本传染数R0，即一个病人平均传染的人数。
The population immunization threshold is calculated depending on the basic viral infection R0, the average number of people infected by a patient.
“R0值越高，要形成群体免疫所需的感染比例就越高。
"The higher the R0, the higher the proportion of infections needed to form a population immune system.
”北京大学公共卫生学院教授宁毅解释说， 新冠病毒R0值在3～4之间，那么，超过60%的人群被感染并形成免疫力后，单个感染者的传染人数才会小于1，即R0<1，此时流行病才得到控制。
Professor Ning Yi, a professor at the Peking University School of Public Health, explains that the new crown virus, R0, is between 3 and 4. Then, with more than 60% of people infected and immunized, the number of people infected with a single infection will be less than 1, R0 & lt1.
“‘延缓’的做法实际上是将感染的波峰后移，延长流行期，降低峰值，类似于正态分布，按英国的推算，短期流行造成一个感染高峰的死亡率和长期、低高峰的死亡是相对一致的。
"The practice of 'delaying' actually moves the peaks of infection back, prolongs the epidemic, reduces peaks, is similar to a normal distribution, and according to the UK's calculations, short-term epidemics produce a peak death rate that is relatively consistent with long-term, low-peak deaths.
”宁毅说，降低峰值理论上确实可以避免医疗挤兑，更合理地利用医疗资源。
Lowering the peak could, in theory, avoid a run on health care and make more rational use of health resources, Ningyi said.
但这其中也有一个问题，新冠病毒肺炎是新发疾病，很多数据还不被掌握，究竟感染多少病毒才产生免疫力又不发病，现在还找不到这个阈值。
But there is also a problem: pneumonia is a new disease, much of the data is not yet known, how much virus infection is immune to disease, and there is no such threshold.
宁毅举例说，理想状态是这个阈值范围比较大、好把控，但如果阈值范围小，假如为100～101，一不小心就会被感染成重症。
Ning said, for example, the ideal state is that this threshold range is relatively large, easy to control, but if the threshold range is small, if it is 100 ~ 101, it will be infected with serious illness.
根据新冠肺炎重症患者现状，治疗时间长，到时又会占据医疗资源。
According to the current situation of severe cases of new crown pneumonia, the treatment time is long, then will occupy the medical resources.
“英国准备了一个剧本，但病毒万一不按剧本演怎么办，这是大家现在担心的。
"Britain has a script in place, but if the virus doesn't follow the script, that's what everyone is worried about now.
”宁毅说。
"said Ning Yi.
按英国目前6700万人口计算，60%感染，即4000万人口，按英国保守估计的1%发病率，即40万人超出免疫“阈值”不幸中招，根据世卫组织官员最新公布的3.4%全球病死率计算，即1.36万人将可能在这场“试验”中死亡。
Based on Britain's current population of 67 million, 60% of infections, or 40 million people, are unlucky enough to exceed the UK's conservative estimate of 1%, or 400,000 people, above the immunization "threshold," according to the latest WHO official's 3.4% global fatality rate, which means 13,600 people could die in the "trial."
“英国以拖延手段来达到群体免疫上升来终止新冠病毒流行，是非常被动的选择，其结果可能是今天的意大利，从新冠病毒的高致死率来考虑，这个策略是不人道的。
"It is a very passive option in the UK to end the new crown virus epidemic by procrastinating in order to achieve an increase in mass immunization, and the result could be Italy today, a strategy that is inhumane considering the high mortality rate of the new crown virus.
” 美国加州大学洛杉矶分校(UCLA)公共卫生学院副院长、流行病学资深终身教授张作风评价道。
Zhang Style, vice-dean and senior professor of epidemiology at the UCLA School of Public Health, said.
宁毅分析，“遏制-延缓-研究-解决”的思路没错，关键是措施没有落实，遏制阶段的限制力度不够，出于保护隐私等目的，也无法追踪、公示感染者信息，因此，延缓的目的便无法达到，第三阶段寄托于一款神奇药物的，可行性并不高，即便现在研制出疫苗或特效药，也还需三期临床试验，夏天到来之前，临床用药的可能性不大。
Ningyi analysis, "containment-delay-research-solution" approach is correct, the key is that measures are not implemented, containment is not sufficiently limited, information on infected persons cannot be tracked and publicized for privacy purposes, etc. The third stage depends on a magic drug, even if the development of vaccines or specific drugs, three clinical trials, before summer, is unlikely.
根据新冠病毒感染人数-时间曲线图，前期经历漫长、平缓的累积后，会在某个时间点突然爆发，翻倍上涨。
According to the New Crown Virus infection number-time curve, after a long, slow accumulation, the early period will suddenly burst out at a certain point in time, double up.
“目前英国还有时间进行管理，再观察一个星期，数据可能会有明显变化。
"There is still time to manage in the UK and the numbers could change significantly over the next week.
”宁毅补充说，按惯例，英国会向美国看齐，美国已于13日宣布进入紧急状态，限制航班，关闭学校，“英国或许很快也会有所动作。
Ningyi added that Britain would follow the usual practice of the United States, which had declared a state of emergency on the 13th, restricted flights and closed schools.
”宁毅说。
"said Ning Yi.
“我必须要对英国公众说实话：许多家庭将提早失去他们的挚爱亲人。
"I have to be honest with the British public: many families will lose their loved ones early.
”约翰逊在记者会上发出这样的警告，“新冠肺炎疫情是这一代人所面临的最严重公共卫生危机”。
Johnson warned at a news conference that "the outbreak of pneumonia is the most serious public health crisis of our generation."
“英国的做法，看着像豪赌，其实也是有一定科学依据的。
"The British approach, which looks like a gamble, has some scientific basis.
” 美国西东大学外交与国际关系学院教授、美国对外关系委员会全球卫生高级研究员黄严忠对《中国新闻周刊》分析说，这是综合了病毒及其流行的特点、国家动员能力、国家卫生承载力、人口结构等等方面，最后做出的决策，已经错过早期遏制阶段，又因保护隐私等原因无法追踪个人信息，“可以说，留给英国的选择原本也不多了。
Huang Yanzhong, professor at the School of Diplomacy and International Relations at Southwest University and a senior researcher on global health at the US Council on Foreign Relations, told China Newsweek that the resulting decision-making combined the characteristics of the virus and its epidemic, state mobilization capacity, national health capacity, demographics and so on.
” 黄严忠说，“实际上，英国首相把别人不敢说的话说了出来，之前也有人是这样做的。
"In fact, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said what other people were afraid to say, and someone else did it before.
”3月14日，229名来自英国各大学的科学家联名发表公开信，认为政府现行防控策略将对英国国家医疗服务体系造成额外压力，并致“远超必要数量的生命面临危险境地。
In an open letter on March 14, 229 scientists from universities said the government's current control strategy would put extra pressure on the NHS and put "far more lives at risk than necessary."
”公开信的联署者同时对英国政府首席科学官帕特里克·瓦兰斯“让感染扩散以造成群体免疫”的言论提出批评。
The letter's co-authors also criticize Patrick Varens, the government's chief science officer, for "spreading the infection to immunize the community."
英国议会请愿网站的统计数字显示，截至当地时间14日上午，已有超过10万人在请愿书上签字，呼吁英国政府采取更加积极的方式，阻止疫情蔓延。
More than 100,000 people had signed the petition by Sunday morning, calling on the British government to take a more active approach to stopping the spread of the epidemic, according to figures from the Petitions website of the British Parliament.
请愿书说，英国有必要效仿意大利，限制一切非必要的市镇间人员流动，同时限制大型集会。
The petition says Britain needs to follow Italy's lead by restricting all non-essential inter-municipal movements and by restricting large gatherings.
按照英国相关规定，一旦请愿人数超过10万，议会就应考虑对相关议题进行辩论。
In the UK, once the number of petitioners exceeds 100,000, parliament should consider debating the issue.
伦敦卫生与热带医学学院教授吉米•惠特沃思表示，“我很惊讶，（政府）目前还没有出台更强有力的措施，但我预计它们将在未来一两周出台。
"I'm surprised [the government] hasn't put in place stronger measures yet, but I expect them to come out in the next week or two," said Jimmy Whitworth, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
