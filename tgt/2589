国内疫情即将进入扫尾期。
The domestic epidemic is coming to an end.
今天，我们通过病、死、生三项数据，来为国内疫情做一个复盘文 |《财经》数据研究员徐进 图 |《财经》视觉中心 编辑 | 谢丽容郝洲一、累计确诊病例：全国总病例数有望控制在81000例左右截至2月29日24:00，31个省（自治区、直辖市）和新疆生产建设兵团累计报告确诊新冠肺炎病例79824例，新增病例573例。
Today, we use illness, death and birth statistics to set a record for the epidemic at home. & # 160; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
今天我们虽然略微调高了全国累计病例总数预期，但信心其实更加明确坚定。
Today, although we have slightly raised our national estimate of the total number of cases, confidence is actually more clear and firm.
今天累计治愈人数首次超过累计病例的50%，意味着从今天起，累计治愈人数超过尚在医院治疗及不幸病死人数的总合。
Today, for the first time, the cumulative number of cured cases exceeds 50 per cent of cumulative cases, meaning that, from today, the cumulative number of cured cases exceeds the sum of the total number of hospitalized and unfortunate deaths.
随着每日新增病例即将全面趋零，疫情防控将逐步转向扫尾阶段。
As the total number of new cases per day is approaching zero, epidemic prevention and control will gradually shift to the final phase.
二、新增病例、新增病死和新增治愈我们就看三个图，讨论一下病、死、生的关系。
New cases, new cases, new deaths, and new treatments Let's look at three charts and discuss the relationship between illness, death, and life.
图1蓝色实线是每日新增确诊病例，这是分析传染病最基本的图，也叫传染病流行曲线。
Fig. 1 The blue solid line is the daily number of newly diagnosed cases, which is the most basic chart for the analysis of infectious diseases, also known as the epidemiological curve.
曲线的顶端（峰值）构成了一个分水岭：左侧的基本传染数（R0）大于1（这次新冠肺炎专家给出的R0在2-5之间，十分凶猛）；右边的传染数在人为的积极干预下变成小于1。
The top (peak) of the curve constitutes a watershed: the primary infection on the left (R0) is greater than 1 (the R0 given by the expert on new crown pneumonia is between 2 and 5); the infection on the right turns out to be less than 1 with active human intervention.
左边的情况犹如脱缰野马，若不能及时有效阻隔，后果不堪设想；右边则是马已被套住，虽然还会跑一段儿，但迟早会停下。
The situation on the left is like a runaway horse. If it is not stopped in time, the consequences will be disastrous. On the right, the horse is harnessed.
我们看见，国内非湖北地区由于疫情起步较晚，社会对疫情警觉相对较早，政府实施动员防控手段坚决有效、资源充沛，使得其峰值能较早于2月3日出现，此后一路下降，基本没有大的反复。
We have seen that in non-Hubei areas of China, due to the late start of the epidemic and the relatively early alert of the society to the epidemic, the Government has implemented effective mobilization and control measures with sufficient resources, so that its peak can be reached earlier than February 3, and it has since declined with little or no major reversals.
接下来出现的是黑线（新增病死）代表的死亡之舟，它紧贴地面，峰值（众值）出现在2月12日，滞后9天。
Then came the Black Line (new death) representing the Death Boat, which clung to the ground, with a 9-day lag in peak (multiples) on February 12.
第三个出场的是黄线（新增治愈）代表的生命之舟。
The third appearance is the Yellow Line (new Healing) represented by the Boat of Life.
它的桅杆（峰值）出现在2月20日，比蓝线峰值滞后17天，不难想见它将与蓝线类似，基本呈正态为主的正偏态分布，只是比蓝线略扁一些（我们推测相对越扁意味着治疗难度越大）。
Its mast (peak) appeared on 20 February, 17 days behind the Blue Line peak, and it is not difficult to imagine that it will be similar to the Blue Line, with a largely normal positive skew, though slightly flatter than the Blue Line (which we assume means more difficult to treat).
图2湖北非武汉地区蓝线表明：其疫情虽起步略早，但峰值并未提前，同样出现在2月3日，之后还出现过（2月11日）较大反复。
Fig. 2 The Blue Line in the non-Wuhan area of Hubei Province shows that although the outbreak started a little earlier, the peak did not occur earlier.
这些与其发病密度较高，隔离救治资源紧缺有关。
These are related to the high density of the disease and the shortage of isolation treatment resources.
孝感、黄冈还一度由于此前追踪、隔离、排查、收治力度远远没有跟上疫情发展，造成了大量待隔离排查救治病例的积压，也就是所谓中型“堰塞湖”。
Filial piety, Huanggang also because the previous tracking, isolation, screening, treatment efforts have not kept pace with the epidemic, resulting in a large number of pending quarantine treatment cases, known as the medium-sized "Yan Sehu."
幸有湖北省委坚强领导，坚决落实中央和中央指导组的指示使各种堰塞湖得以及时化解。
Fortunately, Hubei Provincial Party committee strong leadership, resolutely implement the central and central guidance group's instructions so that all kinds of Yan Sehu can be timely resolved.
疫情经历较长预备期，使得黑线的峰值出现在2月10日，只比蓝线峰值滞后5天。
The extended preparatory period allowed the black line to peak on 10 February, only five days behind the Blue Line peak.
峰值出现后仍保持较高水平。
It remained high after the peak.
跟此前收治不及时，轻症转重症，以及救治资源、救治条件相对不足有关。
With the previous treatment is not timely, light cases to the serious, as well as treatment resources, treatment conditions are relatively inadequate.
生命之舟峰值大约出现在2月22日，滞后19日，其后出现了一个平台，应与堰塞湖有关。
Life Boat peak around February 22, after a 19-day delay, then emerged a platform, should be related to Yan Sehu.
图3武汉疫情出现最早，问题暴露拖延，导致疫情最为严重！蓝线本该出现的峰值一直推迟到2月13日，比国内其他地区晚了10天，甚至比黑线峰值还晚了一天！峰值出现后又在1700例左右震荡了4、5日，消化了较大的堰塞湖，继而又下探到400例左右，持续震荡10余日，再次消化较小的堰塞湖，至今仍未结束。
Fig. 3 Wuhan emerged the earliest epidemic, the problem was delayed, resulting in the most serious epidemic! Blue Line should have been delayed until February 13, 10 days later than the rest of the country, even a day after the black line peak!
如此层层拉锯，层层阻击、反阻击，足见教训之深、疫情之重，也足见中央领导所说的武汉保卫战、阻击战之艰苦卓绝、艰难惨烈。
These layers of saw-sawing, blocking and blocking at different levels show the depth of the lessons learned and the severity of the epidemic.It is also clear from the Central Government's assertion that the Wuhan Defense War and the Battle of Blockade were arduous and bitter.
庆幸的是，我们终于还是看见了生命之舟的桅杆。
Fortunately, we finally saw the mast of the boat of life.
关于武汉2月29日新增病例565例，我们初步分析如下：从2月19日开始的这一轮反常平台拉锯期，更符合消化存量（解决各种遗留问题）为主的数据特征。
Wuhan February 29, 565 new cases, we preliminary analysis as follows: February 19 began this round of abnormal platform saw period, more consistent with digestion of the stock (solve various legacy) -based data characteristics.
特别是28日武汉新增疑似已降到114例，存量788例；29日更进一步降至50例，存量393例，已很难解释当日新增病例数量。
In particular, Wuhan on the 28th of the new suspected has fallen to 114 cases, stock 788 cases; 29 cases further reduced to 50 cases, 393 cases, it is difficult to explain the number of new cases on that day.
还有一个值得注意的变动，就是我们推算出的“湖北确诊未住院人数”在连续多日持续明显下降的情况下，于2月28日突然出现极为异常的增长，而且竟多达396例。
Another notable change is that the number of unhospitalized persons diagnosed in Hubei province, which we have calculated, suddenly and unexpectedly increased by 396 on Feb. 28, despite a sustained and marked decline for many days.
在湖北和武汉已经按中央要求完全做到“尽收尽治”，目前已出现“床等人”的情况下，这396个病例只能是已痊愈的确诊病例，更准确地说，是已痊愈病例的确诊。
The 396 cases in Hubei and Wuhan, which have been completely treated as required by the central government, can only be confirmed cases that have been healed, or more accurately, cases that have been cured with the appearance of "beds and so on."
属于“拉网筛查”、存量消化。
belongs to "pull screen", stock digestion.
因此我们有充分的理由相信，存量虽待消化，当期新增量开始变小，局面已在掌控中。
So we have good reason to believe that while the inventory remains to be absorbed, the new increments begin to shrink in the current period and the situation is under control.
不出几日，武汉就将迎来一片光明。
Within a few days, Wuhan will usher in a bright.
至于图中的绿色虚线是什么意思？它的定义是：在黄、黑线进行平移将各自峰值（众值）与蓝线峰值对齐情况下，绿虚线的对应数值=黑线的对应数值+黄线的对应数值。
What does the dotted green line mean in the figure? It is defined as the corresponding value of the dotted green line = the corresponding value of the black line + the corresponding value of the yellow line when the yellow and black lines are translated to align their respective peaks (multiples) with the Blue Line peak.
在疫情最终结束时，蓝线圈定的总面积=绿虚线圈定的总面积，也即是说，累计确诊病例=累计病死者+累计治愈者。
At the end of the epidemic, the total area demarcated by the Blue Line = the total area demarcated by the dotted green line, that is, the cumulative number of confirmed cases = cumulative cases of illness and death + cumulative cure.
随着每日新增病例趋零，累计病例基本停止增加。
Cumulative cases largely stopped increasing as new cases reached zero per day.
剩下的就是和死神赛跑，让生命之舟接走尽量多的人。
All that remains is a race against death to get as many people as possible out of the boat of life.
我们可以借助这个图推测最终病死率和最终治愈率，例如我们可以预计病死率最近很可能又会经历一个先降后升的过程（有兴趣的读者可以试试）。
This chart allows us to speculate on the final fatality rate and the ultimate cure rate. For example, we can predict that the fatality rate will most likely undergo a downward-to-upward process in the near future (interested readers can try it out).
但强力提升救治能力，提高治愈率、降低病死率的根本，还得依靠那些不惜奉献生命、呕心沥血的医护天使！依靠科学家！依靠政府调集资源！依靠我们的国家和人民！三、卫星发现了一个重要信号，中国正在“热”起来这是转自新华社的消息，小编直接用了新华社的题目。
But the power to improve the ability to cure, improve the cure rate, reduce the fatality rate, still have to rely on those who sacrifice their lives, blood! Depend on scientists! rely on the government to mobilize resources! rely on our country and people!
因为这个题目让身在武汉宅家码字的小编热泪难掩。
Because this topic lets the person in Wuhan house code word small editor tears hard to hide.
图4图5图6图7图8（以上图片均来自新华社）。

不用赘述了，一目了然了吧。
Needless to say, I see it at a glance.
按照中央“统筹好疫情防控和经济社会发展”的要求，精准有效的复工复产已经全面启动。
In accordance with the requirements of the central government to "coordinate the prevention and control of the epidemic and economic and social development," accurate and effective resumption of production has been fully started.
春天回来了，小编自知暂时还难返京，但是很想先去看看东湖的樱花。
Spring back, small editor know that temporarily difficult to return to Beijing, but would like to see the East Lake cherry first.
花期还要两周后开始，相信一定不会错过今年的花季。
Flowering will start in two weeks and I believe I will not miss the flowering season this year.
在中央有力领导、全国人民全体动员的情况下，国内疫情已经得到有效控制，从“数说”角度看已不太可能有大的变数，变数全在国外。
With the strong leadership of the central government and the mobilization of the whole nation, the epidemic has been brought under effective control, and it is unlikely that there will be any major variables in terms of numbers, all outside the country.
今天起，我们将配置力量增加对国外疫情的关注。
Today, we will deploy our forces to increase our focus on foreign epidemics.
四、海外新增病例加速增长，发现确诊病例国家范围继续扩大，世卫组织将全球疫情风险等级调至“最高”图9全球累计确诊病例数突破7000例，其中韩国确诊病例数突破3000例。
The number of newly diagnosed cases overseas has accelerated, the national scope of confirmed cases continues to expand, and the WHO has set the global epidemic risk level at the "highest" figure 9 above 7000, with the number of confirmed cases in South Korea exceeding 3,000.
图10新增病例集中在韩国、意大利、伊朗三国，欧盟的德国、法国、西班牙持续出现新增病例，并呈现加速趋势。
Figure 10 is concentrated in Korea, Italy, Iran, the EU Germany, France, Spain continued to show new cases, and an accelerating trend.
全球死亡数超过100例，美国本土出现首例死亡。
There were more than 100 global deaths, the first in the United States mainland.
图11有必要重点说说韩国的新增情况。
Figure 11 is necessary to highlight the new situation in Korea.
韩国新增数字较快的原因是“新天地”教会成员（总数约为21.5万）仍在陆续接受病毒检测。
South Korea's faster increase is due to the fact that members of the Church of New Horizons, totalling about 215,000, are still being tested for the virus.
新增病例主要集中在大邱市，占韩国新增总数的86.4%。
The majority of new cases were in Daegu, accounting for 86.4 per cent of the total increase in South Korea.
大邱市的感染密度很高，这非常挑战韩国地方政府的应变能力。
The city of Daegu has a high infection density, which greatly challenges the resilience of local governments in South Korea.
目前已有61037例病毒检测呈阴性，有32422例疑似病例正在等待检测结果，且阳性比率预计会比较高，接下来几天，韩国确诊病例预计仍将继续呈现较高的增长态势。
So far, 61,037 cases have been tested negative, 32,422 suspected cases are awaiting test results, and the positive rate is expected to be high. The number of confirmed cases in South Korea is expected to continue to show a high growth trend in the next few days.
【特别说明：2月29日前为世卫组织官方统计数据，数据截止时间为北京时间每日17时；从2月29日开始，数据由《财经》根据公开资料统计，截止时间为北京时间每日9时】小结：武汉拉锯近一两日即可结束。
Special Note: The deadline for data is 17: 00 Beijing time until Feb. 29, 2007. From Feb. 29, the data will be collected by Caijing at 9: 00 a.m. Beijing time according to open data.
国内疫情将很快转入扫尾阶段。
The domestic epidemic will soon be in the final stages.
按中央精神在抓好疫情防控决不放松前提下，有序复工复产将成为新的热点。
In accordance with the spirit of the central government in keeping with the premise of good disease control never relax, orderly resumption of work will become a new hotspot.
与此同时，海外疫情开始变得越来越受关注。
At the same time, overseas epidemics are becoming a growing concern.
