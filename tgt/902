作者 | 第一财经吴丹“今天的雪一直下个不停。
"The snow has been falling steadily today.
让所有过时的情绪，一切都随时间而去吧。
Let all the out-of-date emotions go with the passage of time.
”2月5日，北京进入2020年以来第二场大雪，新裤子乐队主唱彭磊抱着一把吉他站在小区楼下，伴着夜空下的大雪纷飞，独自弹唱一曲《过时》。
On Feb. 5, in Beijing's second snowfall since 2020, Penglei, the lead singer of the new trouser band, stood downstairs with a guitar and sang a single "Out of Date," accompanied by heavy snow in the night sky.
这首发布在他个人微博的原创单曲，很快累积到275万次观看。
The original single, released on his own microblog, quickly accumulated to 2.75 million views.
这个特殊的春节，彭磊十几天都宅在家里，每天为网友弹唱，每首歌都获得数十万点击率。
This special Spring Festival, Peng Lei has been at home for ten days, playing songs for netizens every day, each song received hundreds of thousands of hits.
新裤子也在微博发布了自己的新单曲《我们羞于表达的感情2020》，里面的歌词“漫长无味的假期，空无一人的市井/迷人自由的气息，身陷小小的泥沼里”，似乎与当下情景相呼应。
The new trousers, which also released on Weibo's new single, "We are ashamed to express our feelings 2020," read the words "a long and tasteless vacation, a deserted market well / a charming free smell, trapped in a small bog," and seemed to echo the current situation.
彭磊写道：“这两天重新录音和填词了这个版本，代表这个非常时期的心境吧。
Peng Lei wrote: "These two days, re-recording and filling in this version, represents the state of mind during this extraordinary period.
文艺的人可以在虚度光阴中看书、看电影、画画、听音乐，来让我们不无聊，我们还是幸运的。
We are lucky that literary and artistic people can spend their time reading, watching movies, drawing pictures, listening to music to keep us from getting bored.
”当“宅”成为这个春节的核心词，独立音乐人们并不愿意宅家虚度。
When "home" became the central word for the Spring Festival, independent musicians did not want to waste their homes.
除了新裤子乐队，刺猬、盘尼西林等乐队都在微博上发布家中弹唱的视频，“在家唱歌，希望一切都能快点好起来。
In addition to the new pants band, hedgehogs, penicillin and other bands are posting videos of their families playing on Weibo. "Sing at home and hope everything will get better soon.
”痛仰乐队早在1月24日就率先捐出100万元，这笔数额不小的捐款，对一支独立摇滚乐队来说无疑是个大数目，是他们几十场演出的全部收入。
As early as January 24, the band pioneered the donation of one million yuan, a large sum for an independent rock band and the total revenue of dozens of their shows.
但痛仰乐队说，“武汉一直是我们长年巡演最能感受到热血的城市，我们只想尽自己最大的努力，仅此而已。
"Wuhan has always been the city we've been touring for years," the band said. "We just want to do our best, that's all.
”人们一边关注着抗疫前线惊心动魄的数据，读着疫情下无奈、悲情、揪心、感人的报道，一边仍要宅在家里继续生活。
"While watching the breathtaking statistics on the front lines of the epidemic, people read the stories of helplessness, sadness, heartbreaking and touching stories as they continue to live at home.
