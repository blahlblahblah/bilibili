应该做一个自私的人，还是坚持自己：做一个对社会有用的人？口述 | 高 集整理 | 沈 林今天是我自愿隔离在家的第14天，按理说，我已经可以正常出门了。
Should I be selfish or stick to my guns: A useful person in society? Shen Lin is the 14th day of my voluntary confinement at home today, and I should reasonably be out of the house.
但是最近发生的事，让我的心情很复杂。
But recent events have left me feeling very mixed up.
我叫高集，20多岁的时候交友不慎，做了一些对不起社会的错事，为此，我付出了近10年的青春。
My name is Gao Ji, in the twenties when making friends carelessly, did something wrong to the society, for which, I paid nearly 10 years of youth.
这10年里，我没有接触过外面的世界，铁窗里的滋味谈不上多么好，但多年来养成的生活习惯，特别是十八大以来服刑人员政治教育的加强，让我变得喜欢关注时事，也喜欢思考。
Over the past 10 years, I have not been exposed to the outside world, and the taste in the bars is not very good, but the habits developed over the years, especially the strengthening of political education for prisoners since the 18th National Congress, have made me like to pay close attention to current affairs and enjoy thinking.
去年8月份，我从监狱刑满释放。
Last August, I was released from prison.
因为太长时间跟社会脱节，先回了老家农村，帮家里做些农活，也熟悉熟悉这个陌生的世界。
Because too long with the society disjointed, went home to the countryside first, to help the family do some farm work, but also familiar with the unfamiliar world.
快过年的时候，疫情发生了。
Towards the end of the New Year, the epidemic happened.
大年初二，我所在的村庄封路了，村口设置了一个劝返点。
New Year's Day, my village closed the road, the village set up a point of persuasion.
不久，我听到一个消息，隔壁镇上一户人家从武汉回来，确诊得了新冠肺炎，要命的是，此前他们家老母亲去世，办丧事聚集了很多人，传染面一下子就扩大了。
Before long, I heard news that a family in the next town had come back from Wuhan and had been diagnosed with pneumonia. Their mother had died and the funeral had gathered so many people that the infection spread quickly.
我们这个县比较小，没有专门收纳传染病人的医院，疫情发生后，县里紧急应对，打算建立一个小型的“小汤山”把确诊和疑似病例隔离起来。
Our county is relatively small, there is no special hospital for patients with infectious diseases, after the outbreak of the emergency response, the county intends to set up a small "Xiaotangshan" to isolate the diagnosis and suspected cases.
选址也是几经波折，一开始选了一处烂尾楼，改造一下即可启用，但当地百姓很反对；后来又选了一个酒店，也因为反对声音太大没有成。
The site was chosen after several twists and turns, starting with a dilapidated building that could be used for renovation, but the local people objected, and then a hotel was chosen because the opposition was too loud to be successful.
后来，县里决定就在通往疫区路边的一片宽阔地上，建一所简易的隔离区。
Later, the county decided to build a simple isolation area on a wide area along the road leading to the epidemic area.
为了赶时间，造的是工地那种简易的板房。
In order to make time, the construction site is the kind of simple slab room.
选址确定后，招工却遇到了困难。
Once the location was determined, the recruitment process encountered difficulties.
因为是在疫区建房，当地的老百姓需要在家隔离，外面村子的又没有人愿意去，怕被感染。
Because it is built in an infected area, the local people need to be isolated at home, and no one in the village outside wants to go, for fear of infection.
偶然的机会，我看到了这个信息，我想，终于能做一些对社会有用的事了。
By chance, I saw this information, I think, finally be able to do something useful to society.
工地现场我并不是多么的无私，这个病这么厉害又没有药，怎么可能不怕呢？去之前我也思前想后考虑了很久：首先隔离点做的是简易板房，对于技术的要求不高，纯粹的体力活，我是可以帮得上忙的；第二个政府牵头来做这个项目，一定会把防护措施做到位，生命安全是有保证的；第三个，在监狱里的时候，我就在想，作为一个平凡人，我们伤害过社会，一辈子又能有几次机会，做些弥补？我把想去工地帮忙的想法告诉了一些朋友，人多力量大嘛，不过大部分人都拒绝了我。
Before I went to the construction site, I thought about it for a long time: first, the isolated site was a simple slab house, the technical requirements were not high, pure physical work, I could do something about it; third, when I was in prison, I told some friends that we wanted to help the site, but most of them refused.
后来，我劝说弟弟（高球）和一个初中同学（汪刘清）跟我一起去，他们是泥瓦匠，还算技术工种，应该帮得上忙。
Later, I persuaded my brother (Gao Ball) and a junior high school classmate (Wang Liu Qing) to go with me. They were masons and skilled workers and should be able to help.
没想到动身前，村里人却开始反对我们，原因很简单，我们去疫区建造隔离点，他们担心我们得病，殃及整个村庄，“就算那个镇病人再多，跟你也没关系，你去干嘛呀？”“你这不是多管闲事吗？”“你去了就是给村里添麻烦啊！”云云。
Before we left, the villagers began to oppose us for the simple reason that we were going to the epidemic area to build a quarantine point, and they were afraid that we might get sick and affect the whole village.
说实话，对于村民的想法，我是理解的，但如果你不搞，我不搞，这个隔离点建不起来，病情扩散，最后也将波及到更多人——武汉情况这么严重了，还有来自各地的兄弟舍命建造雷神山、火神山，跟他们比起来，我们这里的情况又算得上什么呢？工作人员给我们消毒我觉得做这件事是有觉悟的，是高尚的。
To tell the truth, I understand what the villagers think, but if you don't do it, I won't do it, the quarantine point won't be built, the disease will spread, and eventually spread to more people--Wuhan is so serious, and brothers from all over the world have given their lives to build Raytheon Hill and Mount Fire.
我没有听从反对的声音，还是跟县里报了名，县里派了车来接，村里拦不住我们。
I did not listen to the voice of opposition, or with the county reported that the county sent cars to meet us, the village can not stop us.
2月11日一大早，我们到了隔离建造点，当时已经有一批人在那里开工了。
Early in the morning of 11 February, we arrived at the quarantined construction site, where a group of people had already begun work.
简易隔离点到了工地上，负责人给我们做了简单的安全培训，交代了一些注意事项。
Simple isolation point to the site, responsible for us to do a simple safety training, a number of points to note.
那两天有点下雨，我们穿了简易的防护服就正式上岗了。
It rained a little on those two days, so we put on our simple suits and got to work.
其实工地的活难度不大，无非就是搬搬东西、装点水管，打扫打扫卫生。
In fact, the work site is not very difficult, nothing more than to carry things, decorate water pipes, cleaning and cleaning.
我们过去工作36个小时后，隔离点就建造完成了。
We used to work 36 hours before the isolation point was built.
县政府给我们每个人开了一张证明，证明我们没有接触过疫区的人，这样回去以后不需要在家隔离14天。
The county gave each of us a certificate that we had no contact with people in the affected areas, so that we did not have to stay at home for 14 days.
深夜赶工我们是2月12日的深夜回到村里的，第二天一早起来，村民们知道我们回来，反响很大：有人向村支书反映了情况；有人报了警；还有已经退休的上一任村支书，还把电话打到了县政府举报我们......很快，现任村支书和一些村干部就赶到了我们家，告诉我们村民反映很大，意思叫我和弟弟两个人暂时搬到村子附近高速路口下面的桥洞里隔离起来；他还对我们的行为提出了批评，说我们管得太多，还给他找事情。
When we got up early the next morning, the villagers knew that we had come back, that the police had been called, that the old village lodge had been reported, that we had been called... and that we had been temporarily quarantined in the cave under the highway near the village.
我把政府开给我们的免隔离证明拿给他们看，村支书态度软和了一些，他说，你有这个证明我也不好说什么，但是村里人的意见很大，你还是在家待一段时间。
'I showed them the government's non-quarantine certificate and it was softer, 'he said.' I'm not sure what to say about it, 'he said.
村支书走了以后，我心里挺憋闷的。
After the village branch book left, my heart is quite suffocating.
我想，我明明做了一件对的事情，不求大红花大奖状，但为什么会得到这样的反应呢？尤其是前任村支书打电话举报我，我太意外了，我想他一个老干部，觉悟应该是在我之上的，为什么也不支持我？也有人开导我，说是因为我的思想已经脱离了我所处的环境，就像城里人戴一块劳力士到乡下，村里人能看出什么区别？不就跟一块上海牌手表一样的嘛。
I thought I had done the right thing, not to ask for a grand prize for red flowers, but why did I get such a reaction? Especially when the former village branch called and told me that I was surprised that an old cadre of mine should have disenchanted me.
我想了又想，可能也是吧，村里人对于未知的恐惧让我和弟弟成了村子里的“不祥之人”，加上农村里菜就在地里，粮食就在米缸里，14天不出去也没什么大不了，为了村里人安心，我就自愿隔离14天好了。
I thought and thought, and maybe so, that the villagers' fear of the unknown made me and my brother the "ominous people" of the village. Coupled with the fact that the country food was in the fields and the grain was in the rice bowl, it was no big deal not to go out 14 days.
工作结束后我初中同学发的朋友圈不过那些天的闲言碎语听得我心里还是很难受，还有人说我和弟弟帮政府办事却被政府隔离了，真傻云云。
At the end of my junior high school classmates sent out a circle of friends, but those days of gossip still hard to hear me, and some people said my brother and I work for the government but the government isolated, it is a fool.
有一天，我弟弟的孩子跑出去玩，跟周围邻居的孩子玩得不亦乐乎。
One day, my brother's child went out to play and had fun with the children of the neighborhood.
没想到很快就有人打电话到村里去了，村干部很快就过来处理了。
I didn't expect someone to call the village soon. The village cadre came to deal with it quickly.
事实上，我家附近的村民也被“嫌弃”了，邻居想去村子另外一边串门的时候，也总是被那边的村民赶回来。
As a matter of fact, the villagers near my home were also "repulsed," and when neighbors tried to visit the other side of the village, they were always chased back by the villagers.
上个礼拜，许多地方复工了。
Many places went back to work last week.
村里也陆续有人出去打工，开健康证，我和弟弟也想去领一张，但没走几步，却被村支书勒令延缓。
People in the village began to work, issued a health certificate, my brother and I also want to get one, but did not walk a few steps, but was ordered to stay by the village branch.
因为这些事，我的母亲也开始责怪我，对我产生了很大的意见，觉得我拖累了家里出去打工赚钱的节奏。
Because of these things, my mother began to blame me, I have a strong opinion that I drag the family out to work to earn money rhythm.
从铁窗里走出来的时候，我告诉自己要改变，这改变必须体现在行动上，回报给社会。
As I came out of the window, I told myself to change, and that change must be reflected in action and returned to society.
但这些天的经历，我总是忍不住在想，我到底是做对了还是做错了？应该做一个自私的人，还是坚持自己：做一个对社会有用的人？我的隔离期结束了，但我的疑问更深了。
But these days, I can't help but wonder if I've done the right thing or wrong, should I be a selfish person, or stick to myself: be a useful person in society? My isolation period is over, but my questions are deeper.
