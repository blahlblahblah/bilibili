武汉封城、公共交通全部关停以后，陈述杰和几个朋友一起召集起一支4000多人的爱心车队，为武汉市的医务工作者们提供后援支持。
Wuhan after the closure of the city, public transport, Jie and a few friends gathered together a team of more than 4,000 people to provide back-up support to Wuhan City medical workers.
直到1月25号，团队里已知至少三人出现发热，公益接送医生行动暂时停止，他们仍然在帮忙运输医疗物资，用行动持续为这座处于黯淡冬日的江城传递温暖。
Until January 25, when at least three people on the team were known to be febrile, the pro bono operation was suspended and they were still helping to transport medical supplies and keep the city warm in the dark winter months.
口述 | 陈述杰记者 | 李秀莉1月23号，我们3-4个人凑在一起产生了做公益车队的想法。
Ritual & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; &
当时封城的政策出来，地铁、公交都停了。
At that time, the city's policy came out, the subway, public transport have stopped.
正好我们与医院有工作联系，看到有些即使不是发热门诊或呼吸科的医生，出租车司机也不愿意载，他们甚至需要步行十几公里回家。
Just as we were working with the hospital, taxi drivers were reluctant to take doctors, even those who were not in the fever clinic or respiratory department, and they even had to walk a dozen kilometers home.
有些医生在没有防护的情况下还要在医院里吃、睡，确实很辛苦，所以想尽自己的一份力。
Some doctors have to eat and sleep in the hospital without protection. It's really hard work, so they want to do their part.
再三考虑，我们决定开始拉群。
On second thought, we decided to start crowding.
一开始是在朋友圈征集车辆，拉朋友加入。
Begin by soliciting traffic in a circle of friends and pulling friends to join.
1月23号招募到400多人，到1月24号早上，人数开始爆发，1月25号包括志愿者和医护人员在内，已线上聚集起上万人。
More than 400 people were recruited on January 23, and by the morning of January 24, the numbers had begun to explode, with tens of thousands gathered online on January 25th, including volunteers and health workers.
整个过程我们没做任何宣传，单纯靠人传人的形式。
We did not do any publicity throughout the process, relying solely on the form of person-to-person.
至于为什么24号开始人数猛增，可能是很多24小时值班的医务人员不太关注外界信息，封城当天还没有意识到这个问题，等到封城的第二天，要上班的或者下夜班的都反应过来了，这个时候需求就爆炸了。
As for why the number of people starting on the 24th has skyrocketed, probably because many medical staff on 24-hour duty paid little attention to outside information, the city was not aware of the problem that day, until the day after the closure of the city, the day after the response of the work or night shift, when demand explodes.
这些人分布在大约23个群里，每个群300-500人不等，其中4000人左右是爱心车主，其他都是医护人员。
These people are spread over some 23 groups, with each group ranging from 300 to 500 people, of whom about 4,000 are loving drivers and the rest are paramedics.
除此以外还有物资转运群、物资捐赠群等，它们都有和红十字会、卫建委对接。
In addition to the material transfer group, material donation groups, they have and the Red Cross, health and docking committee.
远征 摄由于我们是自发临时组织的民间团体，所以一开始管理非常混乱，尤其是从400个人突然升到近万人的时候。
EXPLOITATION Because we were a spontaneous, ad hoc civil society, management was chaotic from the start, especially when 400 people suddenly rose to nearly 10,000.
直到很多好心人站出来承担群管理的工作，才逐渐恢复秩序。
It was not until many well-intentioned people came forward to take on the task of group management that order gradually returned.
现在每个群至少有一个管理者在帮忙协助上传、下达。
Now each group has at least one administrator to help upload and distribute.
提示大家安全以及反馈一些重要的信息。
Tips you to be safe and to provide feedback on important information.
拉人进群的同时，我也和很多打车公司联系，希望他们能够把一些技术或者后台系统借给我们，或者是参与到行动，但是要么联系不上，要么他们在武汉地区停运，要么遭到拒绝。
As the Lars moved into the group, I contacted a number of taxi companies in the hope that they would lend us some technology or back-office systems, or participate in operations but could not be reached, or they were stopped in Wuhan or refused.
没办法，就只能自己搞。
There's no other way but to do it yourself.
我对接了一个朋友的公司，请他们帮忙开发一个简易版本的H5，实现简单的接单和下单功能。
I docked a friend's company and asked them to help develop a simple version of H5, with simple order and single functionality.
当然他们也是纯帮忙，公益性质。
Of course they are also pure helpers, of course, public goods.
虽然有很多医务人员想向我们捐款，我们也都拒绝了，因为怕性质变了。
Although there were many medical staff who wanted to donate to us, we all turned them down for fear of changing nature.
我们主要通过车主所在的区域与出发地划分服务范围，比如你的出发地在武昌，那么就到武昌接送。
We mainly use the area where the owner is located and the originating location of the service areas, such as your departure point in Wuchang, then to Wuchang pick up.
当然也不一定，有些车主会在各区流动。
Of course, not necessarily, some owners will move around the districts.
大多数情况下是固定接送对象，医护人员把自己的联系方式发到H5系统里，爱心车主来对接。
In most cases, it is a fixed pick-up object, the medical staff sent their contact information to the H5 system, the love of the owner to docking.
但是因为车主也有自己的时间，医护人员上下班的需求太大了，很多不能全部得到解决。
But because car owners also have their own time, the need for health care workers to get to and from work is too great, and many cannot be completely solved.
我们也碰到很多从外地经高速路回来的人，因为车子进不来，只能在高速入口等待着，再由我们紧急协调一些车主过去，把他们接回医院。
We also had a lot of people coming back from the other side of the highway because they couldn't get in, so we had to wait at the high-speed entrance, and we had to urgently coordinate some of the owners to get them back to the hospital.
现在我们通过过江隧道时必须量体温。
Now we must take our temperature when we cross the river tunnel.
但封城以后不堵车倒是真的，接人很快。
But after the closure of the city is true, rapid access to people.
远征 摄可能考虑到我们队伍比较庞大，有聚集性效应，一开始有人出来阻止过，但是我们协商解决了。
The expedition might have taken into account the fact that our team was large and had a compounding effect, and someone came out to stop it at first, but we negotiated it out.
后来我们也和交警部门沟通，所有的公益车辆系一个绿丝带。
Later we also communicated with the traffic police. All the public service vehicles were tied to a green ribbon.
遇到交警阻拦，给他们看一下和医护人员的接送聊天截图。
When they are stopped by traffic police, show them the pick-up and chat with the paramedics.
我们自己也制定了管理手册，车主应该做到什么样的防护，以及医生坐车的礼节，比如医护人员尽可能为私家车主提供消毒水和酒精等，都是写在手册里的。
We have developed our own management manual, which is written in the manual, as well as the etiquette for doctors to ride in cars, such as providing disinfectant and alcohol to private car owners as much as possible.
同时我们不提倡接病人和发热的医生。
At the same time, we do not recommend patients and febrile doctors.
甚至尽可能不要接发热门诊以及肺炎治疗门诊的医生，这些规定的目的也是为了防止传播源的扩散至他人的交叉传染。
Even doctors who attend fever clinics and pneumonia clinics are not taken as far as possible, and these regulations are also designed to prevent the spread of transmission to other people.
我们尽可能在安全的前提下帮助一部分医护人员。
We tried to help some of the health care workers as safely as possible.
当然我们现在碰到的在发热门诊的医生很少，他们很多下班直接住医院，有自己的隔离措施。
Of course, we now encounter fewer doctors in the fever clinic, many of them live directly from work in hospitals, with their own isolation measures.
医生包括医院自己也不希望把病毒传播出去。
Doctors, including hospitals themselves, do not want the virus to spread.
虽然一再强调安全性，仍然有爱心车主在无防护情况下接送医务人员。
Despite repeated emphasis on safety, there are still caring drivers who transport medical personnel without protection.
到1月25号，团队里已知至少三人出现发热，我们就把公益接送医生行动暂时停止了，同时呼吁广大医护人员拒绝热情车主的接送，等待核实是否是因为未进行防护导致的发热或感染。
By January 25, when at least three people on the team were known to be febrile, we temporarily suspended the pro bono transfer and appealed to the general medical staff to refuse to be escorted by enthusiastic motorists, pending verification of fever or infection caused by the lack of protection.
暂停服务不久，武汉市新型肺炎防控指挥部第九号通告出来，称除经许可的车辆，中心城区区域实行机动车禁行管理，各社区配备足够车辆服务有通行需求的市民。
Shortly after the suspension, Wuhan New Pneumonia Control Command issued Notice 9, saying that except for licensed vehicles, the central urban areas are under motor vehicle control and communities are equipped with sufficient vehicles to serve the public in need.
再加上缺少防护物资，车主确实要承担很大的风险，所以我们就基本停止这项志愿服务了。
Coupled with the lack of protective equipment, car owners do have to bear a great deal of risk, so we basically stopped this voluntary service.
1月25号下午，我在朋友圈里写下：民间组织的最大使命是传递爱心，传递温暖，给我们的政府有缓冲时间，我们的任务到这里差不多完成了。
On the afternoon of January 25, I wrote in my circle of friends that the greatest mission of civil society organizations is to convey love and warmth, to give our government a cushion, and that our mission is almost done here.
远征 摄不过物资运送服务还在持续，昨晚近凌晨两点，我们的五十辆爱心车主还在去接送医疗物资的路上。
The expedition continued with the delivery of supplies, and our fifty loving owners were on their way to pick up medical supplies around 2: 00 a.m. last night.
到今晚，这些物资将会分发到各个医院。
By tonight, the supplies will be distributed to the hospitals.
也有公司已经做出线上帮扶软件，让需要用车的产品登记，可以接的司机登记好了去领取。
There are also companies that have made online help software, so that the need to register products, can pick up the driver registered to pick up.
我们在中间帮忙分发。
We helped distribute it in the middle.
我今年30岁，做媒体工作，是土生土长武汉人，这里就是我的家，很多医护人员都还不是本地人，他们却在前线作战，如果帮不到他们，我寝食难安。
I'm 30 years old, I work in the media, Wuhan is a native, this is my home, many medical personnel are not local, they are fighting in the front line, if they do not help me sleep and sleep.
但是又要顾全大局不能导致病毒传播，因此真心希望政府征集组织官方支援车队，我一定参加。
But to take care of the overall situation can not lead to the spread of the virus, so I sincerely hope that the government collection of official support convoys, I will participate.
作为观察者和在场者，现在武汉给我的感觉是，情况非常不乐观，据我所知，各大医院都缺物资。
As an observer and spectator, Wuhan now gives me the impression that the situation is not very optimistic, as far as I know, major hospitals are short of supplies.
有些确诊的患者因为床位已满，无法进到医院。
Some of those diagnosed were unable to reach hospitals because their beds were full.
很多患有其他疾病的人也进不去，前几天有一个朋友的姥姥摔断了五到六根肋骨，去医院，医生请他回，因为可能会传染，危险很大。
Many people with other illnesses were also unable to get in, and a friend's grandmother had broken five or six ribs the other day and went to the hospital, where the doctor asked him to come back, because it could be contagious and dangerous.
那么就没有地方能够医治。
Then there is no place to cure it.
面对此类种种，我想我们也做不了太多，惟有尽自己一份小力，让这个城市尽快好起来，让我们的生活早日回到正轨。
In the face of all this, I think we can not do too much, only to do their part to make the city as soon as possible, so that our lives back on track.
