新冠肺炎疫情的发展形势，正在全球范围内急剧变化。
The development of the New Crown Pneumonia is changing rapidly all over the world.
根据中国各省卫健委官方发布消息来看，截至 2 月 24 日上午 9 时，全国已有 23 个省（自治区、直辖市）在 23 日全天的新增确诊病例为零，其中包括北京、湖南、河南、天津等。
By 9: 00 a.m. on Feb. 24, 23 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central government had confirmed zero new cases, including Beijing, Hunan, Henan and Tianjin, according to state health committee officials.
而在意大利，出现了该国首个因新冠肺炎死亡的病例，这促使了意大利在 2 月 21 日宣布将关闭北部多个城市的公共场所。
In Italy, the country's first case of death from pneumonia prompted Italy to announce on February 21 that it would close public places in several northern cities.
截至当地时间 24 日零时，意大利累计确诊病例达到 157 例，为目前欧洲肺炎疫情最严重的国家。
By 0000 local time on the 24th, Italy has reached a cumulative total of 157 confirmed cases, is currently the most serious pneumonia in Europe.
现在，意大利北部已有 11 个市镇封城隔离，学校已停课，同时取消了包括狂欢节、足球赛等一系列活动。
Eleven municipalities in northern Italy are now isolated, schools have been closed and a series of events, including carnivals and football matches, have been cancelled.
违反防疫要求者将面临最高 3 个月刑期或最高 206 欧元的罚款。
Violation of vaccination requirements is punishable by up to three months' imprisonment or a fine of up to 206 euros.

New hospital beds are being replenished in Cordonio, Italy (source: CNN). As of the afternoon of February 23, 169 new infections have been confirmed in South Korea, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 602 and the number of deaths to five, the agency said.
韩国总统文在寅 23 日对外表示，将新冠肺炎疫情预警级别从目前的 “警戒” 提升至最高的 “严重” 级别。
South Korean President Wen Jiabao said Wednesday that the new crown pneumonia alert level from the current "alert" to the highest "serious" level.
韩国国务总理丁世均则呼吁，希望全体国民暂停宗教活动等聚集在室内或是在人群密集的户外举行的活动；并表示，政府将根据法律和原则，严厉应对阻碍政府防疫工作、囤积居奇、聚众集会等让他人感到不安的行为。
South Korea's Prime Minister, Ding Se-jung, called on all citizens to suspend religious activities, such as those held indoors or in crowded outdoor areas, and said the government would deal harshly with such unsettling acts as obstructing government immunization, hoarding and gathering in accordance with the law and principles.
同样，新冠病毒的感染在日本国内也在扩大。
Likewise, infections of the new crown virus are spreading in Japan.
截至 2 月 24 日零时，日本 16 个都道府县累计确诊病例到达 129 人。
By 0000 hours on February 24, a cumulative total of 129 cases had been confirmed in 16 prefectures in Japan.
此外，与中国没有任何关联的感染者也在增加，日本厚生劳动省以及各自治体在持续实施追踪调查。
In addition, the number of infected people with no ties to China is on the increase, and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare as well as self-government agencies continue to conduct follow-up investigations.
但如果加上停靠在横滨港的 “钻石公主号” 上的确诊病例，因其在 2 月 23 日再增 57 例确诊病例，日本境内累计已有超过 800 人确诊感染了新冠肺炎。
However, if we add the confirmed cases on board the Princess Diamond docked in Yokohama, more than 800 people have been diagnosed with pneumonia in Japan since the confirmation of 57 more cases on February 23.
根据外媒报道，新冠肺炎疫情在中东地区的国家中也开始蔓延。
According to foreign media reports, the outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia also began to spread in countries of the Middle East.
伊朗卫生部发言人杰汉布尔（Kianush Jahanpur）在 2 月 23 日宣布，伊朗当日新增 15 例新冠肺炎确诊病例，总病例数达到 43 例，其中已有 8 人死亡。
On February 23, Iranian Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur announced that Iran had 15 new cases of confirmed pneumonia on the same day, bringing the total number of cases to 43, with eight deaths.
为防止疫情进一步扩散，伊朗政府已下令关闭包括德黑兰省在内的 14 个省的多所学校，同时暂停举行文化与体育活动。
To prevent further spread of the epidemic, the Iranian Government has ordered the closure of schools in 14 provinces, including Tehran Province, while suspending cultural and sports activities.
伊朗卫生部同时呼吁民众暂停在重灾区库姆的所有宗教集会。
Iran's health ministry also called for a moratorium on all religious gatherings in the heavily affected area of Qom.
作为什叶派圣城之一，库姆每年都会涌入大量朝圣者。
Qom, one of the Shiite holy cities, flooded with pilgrims every year.
此外，新冠病毒的蔓延范围已抵达阿联酋、以色列和黎巴嫩。
In addition, the new crown virus has spread to the United Arab Emirates, Israel and Lebanon.
阿联酋卫生部在 2 月 21 日宣布，一名菲律宾人和一名孟加拉国人感染新冠病毒，使该国感染病例达到 11 例。
The Ministry of Health of the United Arab Emirates announced on 21 February that a Filipino and a Bangladeshi had contracted the new crown virus, bringing the number of cases in the country to 11.
以色列在 21 日也证实了该国的首个病例，该病患是从 “钻石公主” 号邮轮撤离后乘飞机回到以色列的。
Israel confirmed the country's first case on the 21st, after the departure of the Princess Diamond cruise ship returned to Israel by plane.
黎巴嫩则因一名从伊朗返回的人确诊而成为中东地区又一受到疫情袭击的国家。
Lebanon is another country in the Middle East that has been hit by an outbreak because of the diagnosis of a person returning from Iran.
上周五，世卫组织警告称 “遏制新型冠状病毒全球爆发的机会窗口正在缩小”；同日，美国疾控中心（CDC）也发出警告，表示新型冠状病毒“极有可能” 在美国蔓延。
On Friday, the WHO warned that "the window of opportunity to contain a new coronavirus outbreak is narrowing," and on the same day the CDC warned that the new coronavirus is "most likely" to spread in the United States.
CDC 国家免疫和呼吸疾病中心主任南希 · 梅森尼尔博士（Nancy Messonnier）对记者表示，美国卫生官员正在为冠状病毒 “大流行” 做准备。
Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Centre for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters that US health officials were preparing for a "pandemic" of coronavirus.
图 | 南希 · 梅森尼尔博士（来源：globalepidemics）她说：“到目前为止，我们还没发现病毒在美国社区中蔓延，但很有可能甚至最终确实会发生这种情况。
Dr. Nancy Mason Neal (Source: globalepidemiology): "We haven't seen the virus spread in the U.S. community so far, but it's very likely that it will eventually do so," she says.
当下我们的目标仍是控制病毒在美国的传播速度，这将为我们赢得更多的时间，以便为更多的病例和可能的持续传播做好准备。
Our goal now is to control the spread of the virus in the United States, which will buy us more time to prepare for more cases and possible continued transmission.
”最后，她补充道：“如果那一天到了，我们也必须像中国一样关闭学校和企业。
Finally, she added: "If that day comes, we will have to close schools and businesses like China.
”新冠病毒不像非典，更像流感？此前，就有传染病专家预测过此次疫情的一种未来发展可能：新型冠状病毒可能不会消失，或将成为又一种常见病毒。
Unlike SARS, the new coronavirus looks more like influenza than SARS, after infectious disease experts had predicted a possible future for the outbreak: the new coronavirus may not disappear or become another common virus.
中国工程院副院长、呼吸与危重症医学专家王辰也在央视的采访中表示：“我们可能要做好与新冠病毒长期共存的准备，新冠病毒有可能转成慢性的，像流感一样长期在人间存在的病。
"We may have to prepare for a long-term co-existence with the new crown virus, which could turn into a chronic, flu-like illness," Wang Chen, vice president of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and a specialist in respiratory and critical medicine, also told CCTV.
这种可能性是完全存在的，对此我们要做好准备。
This possibility exists entirely and we must be prepared for it.
”一篇近日发表在《新英格兰医学杂志》（The New England Journal of Medicine，NEJM）的文章也给这种观点提供了支持，该研究首次揭示了患者出现症状后新冠病毒的病毒载量动态变化。
This view is also supported by a recent article published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), which reveals for the first time the dynamics of viral load in patients with symptoms.
其研究结果或可推测，此次新型冠状病毒在人体内的变化更接近流感，而非与其病毒结构更像的 SARS。
The results may suggest that the new coronavirus is closer to influenza than to SARS, which is more similar to its viral structure.
图 | 论文截图（来源：NEJM）该研究由广东省疾病预防控制中心、中山大学附属第五医院、香港大学的学者联合完成，研究人员监测了广东省珠海市的 18 例确诊病患（9 名男性、9 名女性，中位年龄 59 岁，年龄范围 26~76 岁）上呼吸道样本中的新冠病毒载量，并分析了病毒载量与疾病进展后的关系。
The study was conducted by researchers from the Guangdong Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Zhongshan University Hospital No. 5 and the University of Hong Kong. The researchers monitored 18 confirmed patients (9 men, 9 women, median age 59, and aged 26-76) in the upper respiratory tract of Zhuhai City, Guangdong Province, and analysed the relationship between viral load and disease progression.
研究样本中包括位于两个家庭聚类中 4 例继发感染的患者，其中 1 名从未出现症状的患者与已知确诊病例的患者有过密切接触，因此受到监测。
The study included four cases of secondary infection in two household clusters, one of whom had close contact with patients with known confirmed cases and was therefore monitored.
研究人员一共分析了 72 个鼻拭子（从中鼻甲和鼻咽采样）和 72 个咽拭子，每位患者连续 采样 1~9 次；所有患者在研究过程中均使用聚脂棉签。
The researchers analyzed a total of 72 nasal swabs (middle turbinate and nasopharyngeal samples) and 72 swabs, one to nine times per patient; all patients used polyester cotton swab during the study.
图 | 病毒载量：图 A 显示了 Orf1b 在逆转录酶 - 聚合酶链反应（RT-PCR）分析中的周期阈值（Ct）值，该阈值是在从 14 例输入病例和 3 例继发病例的鼻拭子样本中检测到的；图 B 显示了喉部拭子的 Ct 值（来源：NEJM）研究人员分析了从 17 例有症状患者处获得的鼻拭子和咽拭子样本中的病毒载量与症状发作日的关系。
Figure # 124; Virus load: Figure A shows the Cycle Threshold (Ct) value in Orf1b's analysis of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Researchers analyzed the relationship between viral load in 17 asymptomatic patients with nasal swab and pharyngeal swab samples from 17 patients with symptoms.
他们发现，在病患有症状发作后不久就会检测到较高的病毒载量（与 Ct 值成反比），其中鼻子中的病毒载量要高于咽喉中的。
They found that a higher viral load (inversely proportional to Ct) was detected shortly after the onset of symptoms, with a higher viral load in the nose than in the throat.
通过分析，研究人员认为感染新冠病毒的患者的病毒核酸脱落模式与 4 型流感患者相似，并且似乎与非典时期感染 SARS 的患者不同。
The researchers concluded that patients infected with the new cap virus had a pattern of viral nucleic acid shedding similar to that of patients with type 4 influenza and appeared to be different from those infected with SARS during SARS.
此外，研究发现从无症状患者的样本中检测到的病毒载量与有症状患者很接近，这表明了无症状或轻度症状患者都具有传播潜力，并且在感染早期就可能拥有较强的传染性。
In addition, the study found that viral load detected in asymptomatic patients was close to that of symptomatic patients, suggesting that asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients have transmission potential and may be highly infectious early in the infection.
同时，研究人员也建议相较于当年对非典的防控策略，如今要做出一定改变，加强对新冠肺炎患者的早期诊断和隔离。
The researchers also suggest making some changes to the SARS prevention and control strategy and strengthening the early diagnosis and isolation of patients with pneumonia.
因为，SARS 病毒的传播主要发生在发病后的数天，并且在发病早期呼吸道中的病毒载量并不多，当有症状出现后约 10 天左右才会达到病毒载量的峰值。
Because the spread of the SARS virus mainly occurs in the first few days after the onset of the disease, and the viral load in the early respiratory tract is not very high, with peak viral load reaching about 10 days after the onset of symptoms.
而新型冠状病毒是不同的，从很早期就需要谨慎对待。
The new coronavirus is different and needs to be treated with caution from a very early age.
图 | 病毒载量与症状发作日的关系（来源：NEJM）但在文章最后，研究人员也强调了，新型冠状病毒载量与可培养病毒之间的关系还需要更多的研究来分析。
But at the end of the article, the researchers stressed that more research is needed to determine the relationship between the new coronavirus load and the cultured virus.
同时，有部分无症状和轻症患者，在至少 5 天的时间内，都可在其口咽部样本中检测到的病毒 RNA，而这表明研究团队需要更多、更好的数据来进一步确定病毒的传播动态，以便能够筛选出能为研究实践提供有效信息的样本。
At the same time, some asymptomatic and mild patients were able to detect viral RNA in their oropharyngeal samples for at least five days, suggesting that the research team needed more and better data to further determine the transmission dynamics of the virus in order to be able to filter out samples that could provide valid information for research practice.
环球同此凉热？早前由于疫情的传播，偏见与歧视在个别国家的某些角落同样开始蔓延。
With the spread of the epidemic, prejudice and discrimination have begun to spread in some parts of the world as well.
而当中国疫情逐步得到控制，其他国家疫情在快速扩散时，关于 “倘若新冠病毒在全球流行，中国之前的努力是否会白费” 的议论也跃然于网上。
As the epidemic in China is under control, and that of other countries is spreading at a rapid pace, the debate about whether China's previous efforts would have been in vain if the new cap virus had spread around the world has also leapt online.
客观来看，影响是会有的。
Objectively, there will be impacts.
此次传染性如此之强的新冠病毒让 “人类命运共同体” 这一精神得到了极大体现，中国领导人习近平总书记在给美国盖茨基金会联席主席比尔 · 盖茨的回信中指出，“人类是一个命运共同体。
The spirit of the "community of man's destiny" was so strongly embodied in this so contagious new crown virus that Chinese leader Xi Jinping wrote back to Bill Gates, co-chairman of the Gates Foundation, saying, "Humanity is a community of destiny.
战胜关乎各国人民安危的疫病，团结合作是最有力的武器。
Solidarity and cooperation are the most powerful weapons in the fight against epidemics that affect the safety and security of peoples.
”同样，世卫组织总干事谭德塞在媒体会上也表示过：这次疫情在多方面考验着我们。
Similarly, WHO Director-General Lindsey told the press conference: "The epidemic is testing us in many ways."
它是对全球政治团结的考验，考验世界能否团结起来与一个跨越国界和意识形态的共同 “敌人” 作战；也是对全球金融团结的一次考验，考验世界是现在向抗击疫情投入资金，还是因投入不够而在以后为应对其后果付出更多资金；最后，还是对全球科学团结的一次考验，考验全世界科学界能否团结起来为共同的挑战找到答案。
It is a test of global political solidarity, of the world's ability to unite to fight a common "enemy" that transcends national borders and ideologies; of global financial solidarity, of whether the world is investing now in the fight against the epidemic or paying more later for its consequences; and, lastly, of global scientific solidarity, testing the ability of the world's scientific community to come together to find answers to common challenges.
图 | 世卫组织总干事谭德塞（来源：Twitter）目前，全球已有多家医药公司投入到疫苗等药物的研发测试之中。
WHAT & # 45; & # 45; Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tanner, is now testing a number of pharmaceutical companies around the world for drugs such as vaccines.
同样，众多科研人员也在努力地对此次疫情进行多角度的分析研究。
Similarly, many researchers are also trying to carry out a multi-angle analysis of the epidemic.
而对于大众来说，在社会逐步复工、恢复常态化的时期，需要认清一个客观事实：防疫的形势仍然很严峻，稍不注意，一个传播者就可能导致周边一群人被感染；同样，疫情严重地区的医护人员压力依然巨大。
For the general public, as societies return to work and normalize, it is necessary to recognize the objective fact that the epidemic situation is still critical and that, with little attention, a single communicator can infect a group of people in the immediate vicinity; similarly, the pressure on health-care workers in highly affected areas remains great.
所以，复工的这一时刻正是防疫的关键时刻，长期的社会舆论氛围和媒体报道或许让许多关注疫情的人已经进入精神上的“疲劳期”，但这并不意味着人们可以不加考虑和防护地出去逛街、约会或者聚餐。
So the time to get back to work is a critical moment for immunization. Long-term public opinion and media coverage may have pushed many people concerned about the epidemic into a "mental fatigue," but that does not mean that people can go shopping, date or dine out without thinking or protection.
我们不能把每天看到的疫情统计简简单单看作成数据，尤其是死亡人数。
We cannot simply regard the statistics we see every day as mere data, especially the number of deaths.
谭德塞说过：“我们必须记住，这些是人，不是数字。
"We must remember that these are people, not numbers," said Tanner.
”希望大家可以做到对自己负责、对他人负责，尽量减少非必要的接触，更要避免非必要的聚集。
We want to be accountable to ourselves, to others, to minimise unnecessary contact and to avoid unnecessary concentrations.
