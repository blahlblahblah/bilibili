因新型冠状病毒而起的疫情紧迫形势下，来自中国工程院院士、国家卫健委高级别专家组成员李兰娟团队的实验结果，给出了抗击疫情的新希望。
Under the urgent situation caused by the new coronavirus, Li Lanjuan's team from the Chinese Academy of Engineering and a member of the high-level group of experts of the National Fitness and Health Commission gave a new hope to fight the epidemic.
其团队公布，有两种此前治疗甲、乙流感和艾滋病的药物，在体外实验中被认为有明显的抑制新型冠状病毒，以及病毒对细胞的病变效应。
Two drugs previously used to treat influenza A, B and AIDS have been identified in in vitro trials as having a significant inhibitory effect on the new coronavirus and the pathological effects of the virus on cells, the team said.
具体而言，阿比朵尔在10~30微摩尔浓度下，与药物未处理的对照组比较，能有效抑制冠状病毒达到60倍，并且显着抑制病毒对细胞的病变效应。
Specifically, Abidol inhibited the coronavirus up to 60-fold compared with the untreated control group at 10-30 mole concentration, and significantly inhibited the pathological effects of the virus on the cells.
达芦那韦在300微摩尔浓度下，能显着抑制病毒复制，与未用药物处理组比较，抑制效率达280倍。
At 300 micromol concentration, Daruinawire could significantly inhibit viral replication, and the inhibition efficiency was 280 times higher than that of the untreated group.
这一实验结果被解读为抗击疫情的重大突破。
The results were interpreted as a major breakthrough in the fight against the epidemic.
一位用药专家直言，这两种药物均为广谱抗病毒药物，能从众多药物中筛选出有效药物，对目前疫情而言，是一个喜讯。
Both drugs are broad-spectrum antiviral drugs that sift out effective drugs from a wide range of drugs, a welcome development for the current epidemic, one drug expert said.
而基于上述实验成果，李兰娟团队建议将以上两种药物列入国家卫健委《新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎诊疗方案(试行第六版)》。
Based on the above experimental results, Li Lanjuan's team suggested that the above two drugs be included in the National Health Commission's "New Coronavirus Infection Diagnosis and Treatment Programme (Trial Version 6)."
在美国堪萨斯大学医学院病理科教授、国际PROMPT医生培训组织国际部主任董亚峰看来，这一结果是首次发现两种药物在体外实验中，能够对新型冠状病毒产生杀伤作用。
Dong Yafeng, professor of pathology at the University of Kansas School of Medicine and director of the international department of the international PROMPT training group, said the results were the first to show that the two drugs could kill the new coronavirus in vitro.
不过他也提示，体外实验有效，并不一定在人体内有效。
But he also suggests that in vitro experiments are effective and not necessarily effective in humans.
体外实验的成功是第一步，还需要在人体内验证有效后，才可以用于病人的治疗。
The success of in vitro trials is the first step and needs to be validated in the human body before it can be used in the treatment of patients.
所以说，李院士的发现，只是寻找新型病毒药物万里长征的第一步。
So Li's discovery is only the first step in the search for a new type of viral drug, the Long March.
国家卫健委随后也针对此事回应，“有效”的治疗药物是通过体外细胞实验的成果，离临床实践仍有距离，希望通过加快运转过程，缩短周期，将真正有效的治疗方式运用到实际的临床实践中。
The National Fitness and Health Commission then responded that "effective" drugs are the result of in vitro cell trials and are still a long way from clinical practice. It is hoped that by speeding up the process and shortening the cycle, truly effective treatments will be applied to actual clinical practice.
以下为《潜望》与董亚峰对话实录：《潜望》：李兰娟团队2月4日公布了重大消息，宣布两种药物阿比朵尔和达芦那韦在治疗新型冠状病毒的研究中取得重大突破，并引起了广泛的关注，请问您是如何评价这项成果？董亚峰: 首先祝贺李兰娟院士及其团队。
Li Lanjuan's team announced on February 4 that two drugs, Abidol and Daruanavai, had made major breakthroughs in the treatment of the new coronavirus. How do you evaluate the results? Dong Yafeng: Congratulations to Academician Li and his team.
这也是首次发现阿比朵尔和达芦那韦在体外实验中，能够对新型冠状病毒产生杀伤作用。
It is also the first time that Abidol and Daruinawire have been found to be capable of killing the new coronavirus in vitro.
这两个药物其实不是新药。
These two drugs are not really new drugs.
阿比朵儿目前是治疗成人和儿童甲、乙流感、急性病毒性呼吸道感染的抗病毒药物，作用机理是通过影响病毒脂膜和宿主细胞融合，阻断病毒复制，产生抗病毒作用的；达芦那韦是治疗艾滋病的一种药物，常和利托那韦合用，是通过选择性抑制HIV蛋白从而阻断HIV病毒颗粒形成，达到治疗艾滋病的作用。
Abidol is currently an antiviral agent for treating adult and child influenza A, influenza B, and acute viral respiratory infections by blocking viral replication by affecting viral lipids and host cell fusion. Daruinavir, a drug used to treat AIDS, is commonly used with Ritonavir to block HIV granule formation by selectively suppressing HIV proteins.
我今天也是看到李院士的成果是通过新闻媒体报道的，而不是在通常的科学期刊登载，这主要是时间紧迫，原因可以理解。
I also saw today that Academician Li's work was reported in the news media, not in the usual scientific journals, for understandable reasons and mainly due to time constraints.
李院士的这项成果是在体外实验获得的，我要提醒大家的是要科学的、客观的解读这项成果的意义。
Academician Li's results are obtained in vitro experiments, I would like to remind you that the scientific and objective interpretation of the significance of the results.
《潜望》: 李院士团队报道中发现，上述药物在一定浓度下，抑制病毒的效率分别达到60倍、280倍，这是否说明我们抗击疫情拥有了有力的武器？董亚峰：李院士团队在体外实验中，对上述老药物的新用途做出首创性的工作，很有意义，但我们还不能下结论这两种药物可以治疗新型肺炎患者。
Under certain concentrations, the effectiveness of these drugs in suppressing the virus has reached 60 times and 280 times respectively, is it significant that Academician Li's team has done pioneering work on new uses of these old drugs in vitro, but we cannot conclude that they can treat patients with new pneumonia.
大量的药物研究事实表明，药物体外实验的结果往往和在人体内的结果是不一样的；换句话说，体外实验有效，并不一定在人体内有效。
Numerous drug studies have shown that drug results in vitro are often different from those in humans; in other words, in vitro studies are effective and not necessarily effective in humans.
体外实验的药物效率倍数，和体内用药的疗效也没有对应关系。
There was no correlation between the drug efficiency multiples in vitro and the efficacy of drugs administered in vivo.
体外实验的成功是第一步，还需要在人体内验证有效后，才可以用于病人的治疗。
The success of in vitro trials is the first step and needs to be validated in the human body before it can be used in the treatment of patients.
所以说，李院士的发现，只是我们寻找新型病毒药物万里长征的第一步。
So Li's discovery is only the first step in our search for a new type of viral drug, the Long March.
《潜望》：我们注意到，李院士团队今天发布的初步测试，是在体外细胞实验中显示的上述结果。
HOPE: We note that the preliminary tests released today by Academician Li's team are the results shown in in vitro cell experiments.
这一药物从体外研究到临床试验再到最终获批上市，所需要的流程都有哪些？所需要的时间要多长？董亚峰：药物研究是一项非常严肃、科学、客观的工作，关系到我们对生命的敬畏。
How long does it take for the drug to be marketed from in vitro research to clinical trials and finally to the market? Dong Yafeng: Drug research is a very serious, scientific and objective work that concerns our reverence for life.
药物研究、申报、审批、到最后的临床许可的程序非常复杂。
The process of drug research, declaration, approval, and final clinical approval is complex.
一般来说，首先要做体外实验，用细胞或病毒筛选出有效的化学物质；体外实验有效后，接着在动物体内实验；在动物体内证明有效后，才能在人体上验证；人体实验会非常谨慎，要选取一定数量的患者和对照人群，通过一期、二期、三期临床实验，对安全性、毒副作用、有效性等多个指标评估后，最终验有效，再向国家药品监督管理局申请并颁发新药证书。
In general, effective chemicals are screened out in vitro using cells or viruses. After in vitro experiments are effective, they are then tested in animals. Human experiments are very careful to select a certain number of patients and control groups, through the first, second and third clinical trials, evaluation of safety, toxic side effects, effectiveness, etc., and then apply to the State Drug Administration for approval and issuance of new drug certificates.
新药的研制往往要耗费数年，甚至十几年。
The development of new drugs often takes years, even decades.
比如我国首位诺贝尔奖获奖者屠呦呦担任组长发明的治疗疟疾的青蒿素，1969年开始立项，4年后才完成动物实验，1972年开始人体实验，1986年才获得一类新药证书，从开始立项到获得新药证书一共花了17年。
For example, China's first Nobel laureate Tu Yo, the group leader who invented an artemisinin to treat malaria, began his project in 1969, completed animal experiments four years later, began human experimentation in 1972, and won a Class I certificate in 1986.
目前李院士的研究结果是处在第一步的体外实验，所以我说有意义，但也只是万里长城的第一步。
The results of the current study are in the first step of in vitro experiments, so I say meaningful, but only the first step in the Great Wall.
《潜望》：两种药物阿比朵尔和达芦那韦，都是已经上市的药物，为何不研发新药？老药新用，这样做的好处有哪些？董亚峰：正如我前边所述，一个新药的研发周期非常长。
Diving Hope: Two drugs, Abidol and Daruinavir, are already on the market. Why not develop new drugs? What are the benefits of new drugs? Dong Yafeng: As I said earlier, a new drug has a very long development cycle.
李院士高明的地方就是选择已经上市的药物做其新用途的研发，至少在药物的安全性上不用担心。
Academician Lee is a smart place to choose the drugs already on the market for its new use of research and development, at least in terms of drug safety do not worry.
但是这项成果能否转化成治疗新型肺炎的药物，还要很长的路要走。
But it is still a long way from being translated into a cure for the new pneumonia.
《潜望》：如果一切顺利，这些药物对疫情的影响会有哪些方面？董亚峰：这个问题我认为非常重要和关键。
HOPE: If all goes well, what will be the impact of these drugs on the epidemic? Dong Yafeng: I think this is a very important and crucial issue.
作为一个医务工作者，我可以科学客观的讲，这项成果对目前疫情作用不大。
As a medical worker, I can say scientifically and objectively that this achievement has little impact on the current epidemic.
因为仅仅做了体外实验，没有临床试验，还不能证明；即使立即开始做人体实验，也可能要数年才能验证是否有效。
Since only in vitro experiments have been performed, no clinical trials have been performed and this cannot be proved; even if human experimentation is initiated immediately, it may take years to verify its effectiveness.
对于我们现在快速发展的疫情，作用不大。
For our current rapid development of the epidemic, the role is not significant.
在国外，经过病人和医疗机构伦理管理委员会的同意，某些有潜力的药物可以作为同情用药。
Abroad, with the consent of the patient and the medical ethics committee, some promising drugs can be used as sympathetic drugs.
美国第一例治疗新型肺炎患者用的瑞德西韦（Remdesivir），其实是用于研发埃博拉病毒的临床试验药物，在这位新型肺炎患者身上使用，就是用的同情用药的申请程序。
Remdesivir, the first clinical trial in the United States to treat patients with new pneumonia, is actually a drug used in a clinical trial to develop the Ebola virus.
据我所知，目前该药也是处于用于治疗埃博拉病毒的人体临床试验二期；我也看到，最近该药厂宣布在中国进行新型肺炎病毒的三期临床试验，我保留谨慎的乐观。
So far as I know, the drug is also in phase II of a human clinical trial used to treat the Ebola virus; I also see cautious optimism when the plant recently announced that it will conduct phase III clinical trials of the new pneumonia virus in China.
《潜望》：对于此前被引入一些医院治疗程序的艾滋病药物克力芝，两种药物的副作用有多大？董亚峰：克力芝全名叫洛匹那韦托那韦片。
HOPE: What are the side effects of the two drugs on Kaletra, an AIDS drug previously introduced into some hospital treatments? Dong Yafeng: Kalinavetovir is called Lopina Vetonavir.
也是一种治疗艾滋病的药物，和李院士提到的达芦那韦都是治疗艾滋病的药物。
Also a drug to treat AIDS, and Academician Li mentioned that Daruanawai are anti-AIDS drugs.
我也注意到在国家颁布的《新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎诊疗方案》提到了克力芝和利托那韦的运用，我们也需要进一步的循证数据来验证。
I also note that the use of Kaletra and Ritonavir has been mentioned in the State-promulgated Diagnosis and Treatment Programme for New Coronavirus Infections, and we need further evidence-based data to verify them.
至于副作用问题，艾滋病药物本身的副作用相对较大，而且和一些治疗其他症状的药物有交互作用，不过病人不用担心，专业的医生会通过平衡治疗作用和副作用的关系来制定最佳的用药剂量。
As for side effects, AIDS drugs themselves have relatively large side effects and interact with some drugs that treat other symptoms, but don't worry. Professional doctors will determine the best dose by balancing the effects of treatment with side effects.
《潜望》：在疫情发生的时候，我们药物研究的方向在您看来应该是什么？对于目前的治疗重点，您的思路和建议是什么？董亚峰：这次我看到国内科技管理部门和学术部门的高效率和高水平。
HOPE: What do you think the direction of our drug research should be at the time of the outbreak? What are your thoughts and suggestions for the current treatment focus? Dong Yafeng: This time I see a high level of efficiency and excellence in the domestic science and technology authorities and academic departments.
对于人类全新的冠状病毒，组织了多种新药研发、老药新用，和中西医结合的综合治理方案。
For the human new coronavirus, organized the development of a variety of new drugs, old drugs for new use, and a combination of Chinese and Western medicine integrated treatment plan.
这点非常重要。
This is very important.
目前我建议还要做好高效的对症治疗。
At the moment, I recommend effective symptomatic treatment.
因为这是一个全新的病毒，我们对他的致病性和机理都不了解，以往治疗其他病毒的经验是可以运用的，但我建议用循证医学的手段来调整治疗方案可能会起到促进作用。
Because this is a completely new virus, and we don't know anything about its pathogenicity and mechanisms, past experience in treating other viruses is available, but I suggest that evidence-based medicine to adjust treatment protocols might help.
循证医学就是以治疗结果为导向来校准治疗方案的一种医疗模式。
Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is a medical model that calibrates treatment protocols with treatment outcomes.
我们每天有上千例的确诊病例，每个病人的身体状况、年龄、和其他慢病史等等都不一样，我建议把患者的治疗方案和症状改善做数字化的数据库，用数据的有效性来反过来指导调整我们的对症治疗的方案，这样可以大大提高对症治疗的效果。
We have thousands of confirmed cases each day, each with a different physical condition, age, and other history of chronic illness. I recommend digitizing the patient's treatment protocols and symptoms, and using data availability to guide the reorientation of our symptomatic treatments, which can greatly improve symptomatic outcomes.
《潜望》:目前已经治愈的患者，都是如何康复的？董亚峰:大家不要恐慌，此次新型冠状病毒的死亡率目前报道并不是太高，在治疗方面，我建议重点工作要放在提高有效的对症治疗上面，这样可以减轻病人痛苦，延长病人的时间。
On the treatment front, I suggest that the focus should be on improving effective symptomatic treatment so as to relieve the pain and prolong the patient's time.
这一点尤为关键，因为在研发抗新型病毒药物和疫苗都来不及的情况下，通过对症治疗，延长病人生存时间，给体内足够的时间，激发自身的免疫系统，杀伤新型冠状病毒，是一条实用的落地方案，截至2020年2月4号，在没有新药，没有新疫苗的情况下，我们已经有733名患者治愈。
This is particularly critical because, with no time left to develop new anti-viral drugs and vaccines, symptomatic treatment, prolonged patient survival, giving the body enough time to activate its own immune system, and killing the new coronavirus, is a practical landing programme that, as of February 4, 2020, will have 733 patients cured without new drugs and vaccines.
所以，高效的对症治疗，相信自身的免疫系统，我们会看到更多的重症患者得到治愈。
So, with effective symptomatic treatment and trust in our immune system, we will see more serious cases cured.
《潜望》:您认为我们目前应该做的工作还有哪些？董亚峰: 控制疫情的两个决定因素：病毒的传播，和治疗。
What else do you think we should do now? Dong Yafeng: Two determinants of the epidemic: transmission of the virus, and treatment.
抑制病毒的传播最好的办法还是隔离，我们要继续响应政府的号召，能在家就不要出来；关于治疗，我们建议重点放到刚才讲的循证医学指导下的对症治疗。
The best way to curb the spread of the virus is to isolate it. We should continue to respond to the Government's call not to come out at home. With regard to treatment, we recommend that emphasis be placed on symptomatic treatment under the guidance of evidence-based medicine.
新药物和疫苗的研发非常重要，但远水解不了近渴。
The development of new drugs and vaccines is important, but far from quenching thirst.
