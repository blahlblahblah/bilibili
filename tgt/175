如果各地政府都随意征收路过本辖区的防控物资，将对全国抗疫一盘棋的大局带来严重的破坏。
If the local governments are free to levy control materials through their jurisdiction, will bring serious damage to the national epidemic as a whole.
2月6日下午，云南省应对疫情工作领导小组指挥部对大理州大理市政府及大理市卫生健康局征用疫情防控物资予以通报批评，责令立即返还被征用的物资。
On the afternoon of February 6, the Command of the Leading Group for Response to the Epidemic Disease in Yunnan Province criticized the requisition of epidemic prevention and control materials by the Dali Municipal Government and Dali Health Bureau, ordering the immediate return of the confiscated materials.

This article began at Southern Weekend without authorization to reproduce & # 160; & # 45; Xinzhi Responsible Editor & # 144; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
不过，近日，云南大理市征用了重庆和湖北黄石疫情指挥部采购的防控物资，引起广泛的批评。
However, in recent days, Yunnan's Dali city requisitioned Chongqing and Hubei Huangshi epidemic headquarters procurement control materials, causing widespread criticism.
据媒体报道，根据一份盖有大理市卫健局公章的“应急处置征用通知书”，大理市征用了由顺丰物流从云南瑞丽发往重庆市的口罩9件。
According to media reports, according to a Dali City Health Bureau seal "emergency disposal requisition notice," Dali city by Shunfeng logistics from Ruili issued to Chongqing City of nine masks.
而重庆市疫情防控领导小组给大理市卫健局的函显示，这批口罩是重庆市疫情防控指挥部指定企业采购的。
Chongqing epidemic prevention and control leading team to Dali City Health Bureau letters that the masks are Chongqing epidemic control command designated enterprises to purchase.
另一份黄石市防控指挥部发给大理州防控指挥部的函显示，黄石市疫情防控指挥部委托当地龙头企业华新水泥西部事业部和重庆市黄石商会企业（重庆市桥都医药公司）采购一批物资，企业采购后通过顺丰公司大理分公司承运，从云南瑞丽发往黄石，结果也在大理被扣押了。
Another letter sent to the Dali State Control and Prevention Command of Huangshi City showed that the Huangshi Provincial Command had entrusted the local leading enterprises Huaxin Cement Western Division and Chongqing Huangshi Chamber of Commerce (Chongqing Huangshi Huangshi Pharmaceutical Company) to purchase a batch of goods.
瑞丽是边境城市，这些物资，可能是受委托企业从境外购买，通过瑞丽过关运进国内。
Ruili is a border city, these goods, may be commissioned enterprises from abroad to purchase, through Ruili to transport into the country.
事实上，国外捐赠湖北的物资在通关地被当地强制征用的消息，在社交媒体上也屡屡爆出。
In fact, foreign donations of materials in Hubei customs in the local forced requisition, in the social media has also repeatedly burst out.
根据突发事件应对法，有关政府及其部门为应对突发事件，可以征用单位和个人的财产。
According to the Law on Handling Emergencies, the government and its departments concerned may requisition the property of units and individuals for the purpose of coping with emergencies.
但是根据传染病防治法，根据传染病疫情控制的需要，地方政府只有权在本行政区域内紧急调集人员或者调用储备物资，临时征用房屋、交通工具以及相关设施、设备。
However, according to the Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, local governments have the power to urgently mobilize personnel or transfer reserve materials and temporarily requisition houses, means of transport and related facilities and equipment within their respective administrative areas.
在全国范围或者跨省、自治区、直辖市范围调集人员物资，是国务院的权限。
The mobilization of personnel and materials throughout the whole country or across provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government shall be the province of the State Council.
重庆和黄石市疫情防控指挥部委托企业采购的防护物资，其所有权属于这两市，顺丰快递大理分公司仅仅是承运单位，不是相关物资的所有权人，大理无权跨省征收。
The ownership of protective materials entrusted by the Chongqing and Huangshi City Outbreak Control Commands belongs to these two cities. Shunfeng Express Dali Branch is only the carrier, not the owner of the related materials, and Dali has no right to collect them across the provinces.
从疫情严重程度看，黄石市属湖北省管辖，与武汉距离不足100公里，是疫情最严重的地区之一。
According to the severity of the epidemic, Huangshi City is under the jurisdiction of Hubei Province, less than 100 kilometers away from Wuhan, is one of the worst affected areas.
重庆市也与湖北省接壤。
Chongqing also borders Hubei province.
截至2月5日，黄石市共有确诊病例566例，重庆市共有确诊病例389人，而大理仅有确诊病例8人。
As of February 5, 566 cases had been confirmed in Huangshi City, 389 in Chongqing, and only 8 in Dali.
这两地的疫情防控形势无疑更加严峻。
The situation of disease prevention and control in these two places is undoubtedly more serious.
大理市截留征收两地紧急采购的防护物资，将给这两地的疫情防控带来极大影响。
Dali city to retain and levy emergency procurement of the two protective materials will have a great impact on the prevention and control of the disease in these two places.
国务院办公厅早在1月29日就发出紧急通知，提出对地方企业生产的医用防护服、N95口罩、医用护目镜、负压救护车、相关药品等重点医疗应急防控物资由国务院应对新冠肺炎疫情联防联控机制物资保障组实施统一管理、统一调拨，地方各级人民政府不得以任何名义截留、调用。
The Cabinet Office of the State Council issued an emergency notice as early as 29 January, announcing the unified management and unified allocation of key medical emergency prevention and control materials, such as medical protective clothing, N95 masks, medical goggles, negative pressure ambulances and related drugs produced by local enterprises.
在2月3日举行的中共中央政治局常委会会议上，习近平指出，疫情防控要坚持全国一盘棋。
At a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Politburo on February 3, Xi pointed out that prevention and control of the epidemic should be a national endeavor.
各级党委和政府必须坚决服从党中央统一指挥、统一协调、统一调度，做到令行禁止。
Party committees and governments at all levels must firmly abide by the unified command, coordination and unity of command of the CPC Central Committee.
各地区各部门必须增强大局意识和全局观念，坚决服从中央应对疫情工作领导小组及国务院联防联控机制的指挥。
All departments in all regions must enhance their overall awareness and outlook and resolutely obey the command of the Central Leading Group for Dealing with the Epidemic Disease and the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council.
各地区各部门采取举措既要考虑本地区本领域防控需要，也要考虑对重点地区、对全国防控的影响。
Initiatives taken by various sectors in each region should take into account not only the needs of prevention and control in the region, but also the impact on key areas and on national control.
根据不久之后的一份大理市新闻通稿，大理市向大理州房地产业协会提供口罩3万个。
According to a marble press release shortly afterwards, the city of marble to Dali real estate association to provide 30,000 masks.
中物会（物业协会）和省房协也向大理支援了1万个口罩，“一时缓解了口罩需求”。
The China Property Society and the Provincial Housing Association also supported Dali with 10,000 masks, "temporarily easing the need for masks."
湖北重庆等疫情紧张地区，连医护人员都面临防护用品短缺，而仅有8例确诊病例的大理，扣押前方急缺物资，同时又给上级政府的房地产协会提供大量口罩，与中央的规定不符，对全国整体应对疫情不力。
In areas of acute epidemic tension, such as Chongqing in Hubei Province, even medical personnel are faced with shortages of protective equipment. In Dali, where there are only eight confirmed cases, the seizure of urgently needed supplies in front of them and the provision of a large number of masks to the real estate associations at higher levels of government are inconsistent with central regulations and ineffective in responding to the epidemic as a whole.
5日大理方面接受媒体采访曾表示物资已经发放无法追回。
Dali on the 5th interview with the media said that the distribution of the material can not be recovered.
好在经过舆论发酵后，6日，重庆商务委表示，大理已经“答应把口罩还回来了”。
Fortunately, after public opinion fermentation, 6, Chongqing Commerce Commission said that Dali has "promised to return the mask."
2月6日下午，云南省应对疫情工作领导小组指挥部对大理州大理市政府及大理市卫生健康局征用疫情防控物资予以通报批评，责令立即返还被征用的物资。
On the afternoon of February 6, the Command of the Leading Group for Response to the Epidemic Disease in Yunnan Province criticized the requisition of epidemic prevention and control materials by the Dali Municipal Government and Dali Health Bureau, ordering the immediate return of the confiscated materials.
通报要求，全省各地各部门要以此为戒，深刻汲取教训，讲政治、顾大局，决不允许类似事件再次发生，若有发生，将严肃追责问责。
The circular requires departments throughout the province to take this as a warning, draw profound lessons from the experience, talk about politics and take the overall situation into consideration.
同日，大理市应对新型冠状病毒感染肺炎疫情工作指挥部也回应称：对于前期暂扣口罩一事，我们诚恳的向社会各方表示道歉，对造成的影响进行深深的反思与检讨，对相关人员将进行严肃处理，恳请各方给予谅解。
On the same day, Dali City in response to the new coronavirus infection pneumonia command also responded: As for the early days of temporary withholding of masks, we sincerely apologize to the community, the impact of a deep reflection and review, will deal with the personnel will be serious, I beg the parties to give understanding.
对暂扣还未使用的口罩，能退回的将全部退回被征用主体；对已经使用不能退回的，通过沟通达成有偿征收协议的及时给予补偿；对已经使用，不能退回的，被征收主体又需要口罩的，将尽快补齐后退回。
If a mask is temporarily unused, it will be returned to the requisitioned subject if it can be remanded, and compensation will be made promptly to the requisitioned subject if the mask has already been used and cannot be returned.
大理方面应尽快兑现承诺，让紧缺物资尽快在最急需的地方发挥作用。
Dali should fulfill its commitment as soon as possible so that the shortage of goods in the most urgent places to play a role.
这种做法必须予以严肃查处，以儆效尤。
Such practices must be dealt with seriously in order to serve as an example.
否则，如果各地政府都随意征收路过本辖区的防控物资，将对全国抗疫一盘棋的大局带来严重的破坏。
Otherwise, if the local governments are free to levy control materials through their jurisdiction, will bring serious damage to the national epidemic as a whole.
