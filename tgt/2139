微信公号“央视新闻”自2月16日凌晨完成第一例新冠肺炎逝者遗体解剖之后，华中科技大学同济医学院法医系教授、湖北省司法鉴定协会会长刘良与其团队至今已经获得了9例逝者的病理样本。
"CCTV News" on Feb. 16, after the completion of the first autopsy of the deceased crowns pneumonia, Huazhong University of Science and Technology Tongji Medical School, forensic medicine professor Liu Liang and his team have so far obtained pathology samples of 9 deceased patients.
日前，央视记者就新冠肺炎逝者遗体解剖一系列的问题专访了刘良。
Recently, CCTV reporters on the dead crown pneumonia autopsy series of questions interviewed Liu Liang.
Play遗体解剖的目的是什么？记者：解剖新冠肺炎逝者遗体，并对重要信息进行研究，是出于什么目的？刘良：目的是要搞清楚这个病毒伤害了病人的什么地方，我们叫“靶器官”。
What is the purpose of the autopsy of PlayReporter: What is the purpose of dissecting the dead body of the New Crown Pneumonia and studying important informationLiu Liang: To find out where the virus has injured the patient, we call it a target organ.
我们要探讨病毒的传播途径，还要针对这个地方研究用药。
We're going to look at how the virus spreads, and we're going to have to look at this place.
此外，还要弄明白这个病毒是通过什么机制让肺受到损伤的。
Also, understand the mechanism by which the virus causes lung damage.
如果找准的话，就可以针对性地采取保护性措施。
If accurate, protective measures can be targeted.
如果没有解剖的话，基本上就搞不清楚对手，也搞不清楚它打击你的方向，是茫然的。
If there is no autopsy, basically do not know the opponent, and it is not clear which direction it hit you, is at a loss.
首例解剖手术为何迟迟未进行？早在1月22日，刘良就呼吁对新冠肺炎逝者进行病理解剖，并联合团队向相关部门递交紧急报告，强调病理解剖的重要性。
As early as January 22, Liu called for an autopsy to be performed on the deceased patients of Newcomial Pneumonia and submitted an emergency report to the relevant department, stressing the importance of pathology.
然而第一例新冠肺炎逝者遗体解剖手术直到2月16日才进行，这期间刘良团队遇到了什么难题？刘良：首先，场地保证不了，解剖场地必须是要负压的，但我们国家只有负压的实验室，没有负压的解剖室。
But what difficulties did Liu's team encounter during the autopsy of the dead in the first case of pneumonia on Feb. 16? Liu Liang: First, the site could not be guaranteed and the anatomy site had to be negative pressure, but in our country there was only a negative pressure laboratory and no anatomy room with negative pressure.
此外，伦理方面，我们还要征求死者家属的同意，要面对面去沟通。
In addition, ethical aspects, we also need to seek the consent of the bereaved family, face to face to communicate.
这包括时间和空间上的问题，所以难度很大。
This includes both time and space issues, so it is very difficult.
记者：您在等待的过程中心态是怎样的？刘良：我着急，因为不断有人死去，然后都很茫然。
Reporter: What is your mentality in the process of waiting? Liu Liang: I am in a hurry, because some people are dying, and then they are all at a loss.
如果早一天知道病变，对临床治疗是非常有价值的。
It is very valuable for clinical treatment if you know the lesion one day early.
家属同意捐献遗体，手术室改造为解剖间2月15日下午，刘良接到通知，有家属同意捐献亲人的遗体做病理解剖，武汉金银潭医院同意将一间小手术室改造为解剖间。
The family agreed to donate the body, the operating room into anatomy room February 15 afternoon, Liu Liang was informed that the family agreed to donate the remains of their loved ones for pathologic autopsy, Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital agreed to convert a small operating room into an anatomy room.
刘良：这个医院的手术室是一个带负压的空间，比较适合解剖。
Liu Liang: This hospital's operating room is a negative pressure space, more suitable for anatomy.
我们把里面非必要的东西全部清走了，还有一个要注意的是，不造成室内一些血迹的污染。
We've removed everything that wasn't necessary, and one caveat is not to contaminate the house with some blood stains.
因为除了空气以外，它还对地面和对下水有影响。
Because in addition to air, it also has an impact on the ground and on the water.
记者：您进去之前要做什么样的防护？刘良：我们跟临床医生一样，要做各种防护，当然我们的防护级别要高。
Journalist: What kind of protection do you need to take before you go inLiu: We need to do all kinds of protection, just like the clinicians do, of course, our level of protection should be high.
我们戴三层手套，两层口罩，帽子戴两层或者三层，然后护目镜加上防护屏。
We wear three gloves, two masks, two or three hats, and protective goggles.
服装的规格也很高，密封性特别好，不透风不透气。
Clothing specifications are also high, particularly good sealing, airtight airtight.
这样就能把全身暴露的位置全部给封闭掉。
This will shut off all the exposed positions.
首例遗体解剖近三小时，是平日三倍2月16日凌晨一点左右，刘良团队三人进入解剖间，开始新冠肺炎逝者的第一例病理解剖。
The first autopsy nearly three hours, is usually three times February 16 around 1: 00 a.m., Liu Liang's team into the anatomy room, began the new crown pneumonia deceased cases of the first anatomy.
刘良：解剖前，我们集体给他鞠躬，鞠躬时间特别长。
Liu Liang: Before the anatomy, we bow to him collectively, especially for a long time.
我们对这位逝者非常尊敬，发自内心非常感谢他们，他们是大爱。
We owe a great deal of respect to the deceased, and from the bottom of our hearts we thank them very much.
平时做一例解剖手术，刘良需要一个小时左右。
Usually do an anatomical operation, liang liang needs an hour or so.
而第一例新冠肺炎患者遗体解剖却持续了将近三个小时，几乎是平日的三倍，到凌晨三点五十分才结束。
The autopsy of the first patient with pneumonia lasted nearly three hours, almost three times the usual rate, before ending at 3: 50 am.
记者：这次时间长的原因是什么？刘良：第一是第一例，要谨慎小心一点；第二确实是很难受。
Reporter: What is the reason for this long timeLiu Liang: First, the first case, be careful; the second is really very uncomfortable.
人在里面缺氧，到后面缝一针就大喘气，腰也不舒服。
The person inside hypoxia, to the back seam a needle big panting, waist is also uncomfortable.
穿上那个服装，就跟宇航员一样，闷在里面汗不停地往下掉，会有脱水的情况。
Put on that dress, just like the astronauts, in the sweat kept falling, there will be dehydration.
下半夜，也有饥饿的状态。
There was hunger in the middle of the night.
遗体解剖多多益善，要做分类记者：从做第一例到现在，您觉得是多多益善，还是到了一定的需求就可以了？刘良：多多益善。
Reporter: From the first case until now, do you think it is more and more good, or to a certain degree of demandLiu Liang: More and more good.
记者：为什么？刘良：开始说病毒“欺负”老人，过了一段时间年轻人也有了，小孩也有了。
Reporter: Why? Liu Liang: Begin to say the virus "bully" the old man, after a period of time also have young people, children have.
所以它必须要按不同的年龄、不同的性别、自身有没有其他疾病做分类。
So it has to be classified according to age, sex, and whether it has any other diseases.
这样就能把这个肺炎的一般规律找出来。
This will make it possible to find out the general pattern of pneumonia.
如果不做分类，很容易产生新的问题。
If not classified, new problems could easily arise.
解剖结果近几天会公布由解剖获得的新冠肺炎病理已送检，有望寻找到新冠肺炎的致病性、致死性病理，给未来临床治疗危重症患者提供依据。
The results of the autopsy will be announced in recent days. It is hoped to find out the pathogenicity and fatal pathology of New Crown Pneumonia and provide evidence for future clinical treatment of critically ill patients.
刘良：24日早上钟南山院士给我打过电话，他说他们前线的医生就等我这个结果了，否则不知道治疗到底怎么办，治疗效果怎么评估。
Liu Liang: Academician Zhong Nan Shan called me on the morning of the 24th. He said the doctors on their front line were waiting for me to come up with this result.
记者：您接到这个电话，心里怎么想？刘良：我着急，赶快抓紧时间，到24日其实已经开始有初步结果了。
Reporter: What do you think when you receive this phone call? Liu Liang: I am in a hurry.
初步结果我们内部在讨论，形成一个共识，近几天就会发出来。
