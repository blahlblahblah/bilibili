疫情下的深呼吸——困境农民工家庭个案实录（之二）不识字的我，心里压力很大口述者：李玲（化名）/山东籍打工所在地：北京编者注：李玲，47岁，不识字。
Deep Breathing in an Epidemic Situation 2007-9-24 16: 48 Illiterate I am a very stressed oral person: Li Ling (not her real name) / Shandong working place: Beijing Editor's Note: Li Ling, 47 years old, illiterate.
因为丈夫腰病严重不能工作，她独自一人带着就读小学5年级的女儿冉冉在北京打工谋生。
With her husband severely unable to work due to her low back disease, she took her fifth-grade daughter, Ran Ran, to work alone in Beijing.
虽然李玲自己也患有腰间盘突出和心肌炎，只因病情相对丈夫较轻，她顶着压力打着两份家政小时工，一个人支撑着家。
Although Li Ling herself suffered from bulging lumbar discs and myocarditis, she was under pressure to work two hours as a domestic worker and to support her family because her illness was lighter than that of her husband.
现在的收入就是我自己打了两份小时工我老家是山东菏泽单县农村的，2012年到北京打工，以前断断续续来了又回去，很多次。
Now the income is that I played two hours of my own home is rural Shandong Heze Dan County, in 2012 to work in Beijing, before intermittent back and forth, many times.
我在北京干着两份做饭的小时工，我和老公身体都不好，干不了别的活儿。
I worked two hours cooking in Beijing. Neither my husband nor I were in good health to do anything else.
我不识字，我们家就靠我挣钱。
I can't read. My family depends on me for money.
我有腰间椎盘突出的病，心脏也不舒服，也有点心肌炎，得了8年多了。
I have lumbar disc protrusion disease, the heart is also uncomfortable, also a bit myocarditis, got more than 8 years.
这两天不知道是（因为疫情）吓得还是什么的，反正晚上老出汗，心里空落落的难受。
Do not know these two days is (because of the outbreak) scared or something, anyway at night often sweating, the heart empty uncomfortable.
心肌炎也去医院看过，是以前有一次发烧烧的特别厉害，烧的眼睛当时都看不见了，也烧出心肌炎了，一直没有除根，现在没吃药，什么药也没吃，没有钱。
Myocarditis also went to the hospital to see, is a fever before a particularly fierce, burning eyes were not seen, also burned out of myocarditis, has not taken root, no medicine, no medicine, no money.
腰椎间盘压迫的腿走路疼，医院说得做手术，要十万元，没有别的好办法，而且做不好的话会残疾。
The leg that lumbar intervertebral disc presses walks to ache, hospital says do an operation, want 100,000 yuan, there is no other good method, and if do not do badly meeting disability.
我老公也是腰间盘突出，比我还厉害，腰疼起来疼得直哭，只能吃止疼片，不吃饭光吃药把胃吃坏了，胃穿孔了，腰就没法继续治疗，回家先养胃。
My husband also had prominent lumbar discs, which was worse than mine. He was crying with pain and could only eat painkillers. He did not eat any medicine to eat his stomach.
后来我的腰也开始疼了，他就没法继续去看病，就在老家养着。
Later my waist began to ache, he can not continue to see a doctor, just in his hometown.
他也没继续上过班。
He did not continue to work.
他看着跟好人一样，一干活就不行，等过年我想着给他找一个做保安什么的工作。
He looks like a good guy, he can't do a job, and when the New Year is over I want to find him a job as a security guard or something.
他心情不好就特别烦躁，我想他哪怕给饭店刷个碗啥的，可即使想去干小时工，人家也不愿意找男同志的……慢慢来，有工作干了心情就不一样了，等天暖和了让他去找找试试。
He is particularly irritable when he is in a bad mood, and I think he will even paint a bowl for a restaurant, but even if he wants to work part-time, people won't look for a gay man... Take your time.
他要是能干点活，我的负担也能小一点。
If he could do some work, my burden would be less.
我是一着凉或者一阴天，腰疼就特别明显。
When I get a cold or a cloudy day, the backache is especially noticeable.
腰特别疼的话就休息两天，或者拿热水袋敷一下，自己知道这病是怎么回事了，没再上过医院。
The waist special aches words to rest two days, or take the hot water bag compress, oneself knows this disease is how to return to a hospital.
全家三口人都有新农合，3个人一年交1000元。
There are three people in the family, three of whom pay 1000 yuan a year.
住院的话能报70%，减去这个药、那个药不能报的，其实就相当于能报销40%。
If you are hospitalized, you can quote 70%, subtract this medicine, and you can't report that medicine, which is equivalent to 40% reimbursement.
现在的收入就是我自己打了两份家政做饭的小时工，一份是每天上午，另一份是每天晚上两小时去给人家做饭，一个月一共3000元。
My income is now two hours of home cooking for myself, one every morning and the other two hours a night, for a total of 3,000 yuan a month.
花销就是房租水电1100元/月，孩子每学期3000元学费杂费什么的，有时我或者她爸腰不舒服，再花钱买点药。
Expenses are rent, water and electricity 1100 yuan / month, children 3,000 yuan per semester tuition fees and so on, sometimes I or her father waist uncomfortable, and then pay for some medicine.
▲ 李玲在城里的出租屋（摄于2019年夏季）我不识字，这个武汉肺炎我们知道的都不多腊月二十七，我自己带着女儿回到老家了，我老公本来是在老家待着，因为冬天老家冷，没有暖气，于是他冬天就回北京了。
Li Ling in the city (summer 2019) I can not read, this Wuhan pneumonia we do not know much about 27, I returned home with my daughter, my husband was originally in the home, because the winter home cold, no heating, so he returned to Beijing in winter.
春节他没有回去，留在北京自己过年，因为北京有暧气。
He did not go back to Beijing for the Spring Festival, because Beijing is ambiguous.
我和冉冉在老家没有暖气，买了个热水袋还有电热毯，能管点用。
Ran Ran and I had no heating in our hometown. We bought a hot water bag and an electric blanket to help us.
我返乡时不了解疫情，大年三十和初一就只是听说武汉有这个病，但是没传到我们这，不厉害，但没想到这么严重。
I did not know the epidemic when I returned home, New Year's Day 30 and the first day only heard that Wuhan has this disease, but did not spread to us, not bad, but did not expect so serious.
初一大家还都拜年来着，初二串亲戚时听村干部广播了才知道，村里的路都封上了，我们是初二才知道这个事。
On the first day of the new year, we all visited relatives in junior high school to listen to the village cadres broadcast, only to know that the village roads are sealed, we are only the second day of learning about this matter.
据说我们老家从武汉回来好多人，都给隔离了，不让他们出去。
It is said that many people came back from Wuhan in our hometown, and were isolated and refused permission to go out.
离我们这挺近（安徽老家）的某个庄有人确定是这个病了，但是据说是跑了，现在找不着人，所以现在谁也不敢出去，我们村里的路口全都是挖掘机给挖断了。
Somewhere near us [home in Anhui Province] someone must have been ill, but it is said to have run away, so no one dared go out now, and all the intersections in our village had been broken by excavators.
谁也不敢上谁家去，就在家里哪也不敢去，人心惶惶的。
No one dares to go up to anyone's house, just at home where they dare not go, panic.
我不识字，关于这次这个武汉肺炎（指新型冠状病毒肺炎）我们都知道的不多。
I can't read. We don't know much about this case of Wuhan pneumonia.
还是我们家女儿去小卖部买的口罩，她说如果出门就戴上。
My daughter also went to the grocery store to buy a mask, she said if you go out to wear it.
她买的好像是一次性的口罩，外包装上没写医用口罩。
She bought what appeared to be a disposable mask with no medical mask on the outside.
传播途径啥的，我们也不知道。
We don't know what the transmission route is.
冉冉现在天天也不出去，那天她跟我说“妈妈咱们找点醋把屋里熏一下吧？”还说“买点口罩吧！”她就在屋里看看书看看电视，做作业啥的了，也不敢出去。
Ran Ran does not go out every day. The other day she said to me, "Let's find some vinegar and smoke the house." And she said, "Buy a mask!" She was reading in the house, watching TV, doing homework, and didn't dare go out.
昨天女儿问我：“妈妈有这个病是什么症状啊？妈妈我也头疼不想走路，要不你带我上医院看看吧？”。
Yesterday my daughter asked me: "What symptom is mother has this disease? Mother I do not want to walk, or you take me to the hospital?"
邻村有小卫生室，不舒服了可以去看看。
There is a small health room in the neighbouring village.
我说你可别瞎说别吓妈妈。
I said you don't tell me not to scare mom.
孩子舅舅说，我娘家村里有个发烧的，让我千万别去了，去了也进不去村子。
My uncle said that my mother's village has a fever, let me not go, go to the village can not enter.
说是村里有人发烧去了县医院，有可能是这个病例，村里也把他家封上了，我们反正也不知道他是一般的感冒发烧，还是这个病毒发烧。
Some people in the village have a fever to go to the county hospital, it may be this case, the village has sealed his home, we do not know whether he is a common cold fever, or the virus fever.
村里人心惶惶的。
The village was terrified.
▲ 协作者社会工作者探访李玲家（摄于2019年夏季）在一起都有感情了，我就特别担心老太太他们俩。
The co-author social worker visited the Li Ling family (taken in summer 2019) and had feelings together, and I was particularly worried about the old lady and them.
我在北京给老人做饭，当时要回家过年时，老人就不想让我回去，因为老爷子和老太太都快90岁了，老太太身体还不太好，住在4楼还没有电梯，他们特别爱干净，不想吃外边的饭，就想留我给他们做饭。
When I was cooking for the old people in Beijing, the old man didn't want me to go home for the New Year because the old man and the old lady were both nearly 90 years old. The old lady was not well enough to live on the fourth floor.
他们就跟我商量能不能不回家，我说不行啊，因为我爸我妈都80（岁）了，一个得过直肠癌，一个得过脑出血，他们老想我，老给我打电话，不回去不行。
They just talked to me about not coming home, I said no, because my dad and my mom are 80 years old, one has rectal cancer, one has a cerebral hemorrhage, they always miss me, they always call me, can't go back.
俩老人就跟我商量回家去一个礼拜行不行？我说两个礼拜吧！那天我给他们打电话，说这可怎么办啊？我说我们这的路可能封上了，现在没走。
The two old men just talked to me about going home for a week? I said two weeks! I called them the other day and said what could be done? I said we might have sealed the road, but we're not leaving now.
他们说他们吃饭都困难，买东西也下不去楼。
They said they had difficulty in eating and could not go downstairs.
他家儿子年前二十九出去玩了，因为疫情这个事他儿子也回不去。
His son went out 29 years ago, because of the outbreak of the disease his son can not go back.
他家闺女跟着女婿回东北了，也回不去。
His daughter followed her son-in-law back to the Northeast and couldn't go back.
我也着急这事呢。
I'm in a hurry about this, too.
像你说的我跟他打电话让他们联系社区，让社区想想办法帮帮忙啥。
Like you said, I called him and asked them to contact the community and ask the community to find a way to help.
他们家对我挺好的，挺信任的。
They're nice to me. They trust me.
老太太身体不好，我之前跟他们说过让他们找个长期的保姆吧，他们找过3个，觉得不好，还是打电话让我回去，老太太还哭，还让她闺女开车上我家找我商量，说小李你还是回去照顾我妈吧，找了3个人都不行。
The old lady is not well, I told them before let them find a long-term babysitter, they looked for three, feel bad, or called me back, the old lady still cried, and let her daughter drive to my house to consult me, said Xiao Li you had better go back to look after my mother, found three people can not.
她一哭我就心里那啥了，就又回来了。
As soon as she cried, I felt what it was, and then I came back.
今年我回老家把他家的钥匙门卡都带回了，本来我说回家前还给他们，他们说你就拿着吧，拿着方便，啥时候回来就能开门了。
I brought home the keys to his house this year, and when I said I would give them back before I went home, they said take it.
他们对我好，说实话在一起待得时间长了都有感情了，我就特别担心老太太他们俩。
They were nice to me, and I'm really worried about the old lady and the two of them when I've been together a long time.
我想着要是能初十左右顺利回北京去，我就还是在老太太家里做小时工，要是我不能及时回去，就得跟他们说找别人了。
I thought if I could make it back to Beijing by the 10th grade, I would work part-time at the old lady's house. If I couldn't get back in time, I'd have to talk to them about finding someone else.
我也不知道他在北京好不好找人，因为这个病（新冠肺炎）外地的人可能都回不去吧？孩子她爸自己在北京，家里也有米有面，倒是有吃的，就是菜价可贵了。
I don't know if he'll be able to find someone in Beijing, because people from other places may not be able to go back to their homes.
我还得问问大巴车还能不能继续开，我也得问一下北京那边房东是不是能继续租房或者是不是涨钱啥，也不知道这个病什么时候能够过去。
I also have to ask if the bus can continue, and I have to ask the landlord in Beijing if he can continue renting or not, and when the disease will pass.
▲ 李玲的女儿参加协作者举办的公益夏令营（摄于2019年夏季）社会工作者手记和李玲通电话的过程，仍然能感觉到她的坚韧。
Li Ling's daughter can still feel her tenacity by taking part in a volunteer summer camp run by her co-author (taken in summer 2019) as social workers talk on the phone with Li Ling.
和众多朴实勤劳的农村妇女一样，她忍着腰痛独自支撑着一家人的生活。
Like many plain, hard-working rural women, she endured low back pain to support her family's life alone.
她担心着丈夫的腰病，更担心着丈夫的心理状态。
She was worried about her husband's lumbar illness and more about his mental state.
突如其来的疫情，让她感到惶恐不安，但即使在这种情况下，她还挂念着在城里雇主家的两位老人——如同她面对生活的坚韧一样，她在困难面前显现出的善良，让我倍感希望，即使在疫情尚不明朗的当下。
She was terrified by the sudden outbreak, but even then she was thinking of the two old men who worked for her in the city - just as she had shown her kindness in the face of adversity, and made me hope, even in the midst of an uncertain epidemic.
