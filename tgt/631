2月4日下午，《新民周刊》连线了正在一线的第一批上海援鄂医疗队领队、临时党总支书记、上海市第一人民医院副院长郑军华，了解第一批上海援鄂医疗队在武汉金银潭医院的具体情况，也澄清了现在社会上的对于医疗队安全保障的关切。
On the afternoon of February 4, Xinmin Weekly connected the first group of leaders of medical teams in Shanghai, the general secretary of the temporary party and the Vice-President of the First People's Hospital of Shanghai.
郑军华表示，医疗队经过十多天的磨合，已经达到了基本默契，也形成了团队精神，目前每个人都在努力地工作，希望更多更好地治疗好病人，并降低死亡率。
Zheng said that after more than 10 days of wear and tear, the medical team has reached a basic understanding, but also formed a team spirit, everyone is working hard, hope more and better treatment of patients, and reduce mortality.
其中医务人员的防护工作是第一重要的，因为只有医务人员健康，才能救治更多的病人，他希望每个人都能安安全全地来，安安全全地返回上海。
The protection of medical personnel was of paramount importance, since only the health of medical personnel would enable more patients to be treated, and he hoped that everyone would be able to return to Shanghai safely and securely.
记者 | 周 洁新民周刊：第一批上海援鄂医疗队奔赴武汉已经将近两周时间了，我们对于疾病的认识、救治的策略，是不是有了一些经验？郑军华：我们是除夕夜里出发的，到今天（2月4日）差不多已经12天了。
Zhou Jie Xinmin Weekly: Nearly two weeks ago, the first medical teams from Shanghai came to Wuhan. Have we had any experience in understanding and treating the disease? Zheng Junhua: We started on New Year's Eve, almost 12 days ago today (February 4).
我们到了以后，全体队员都经受了很大的考验，尤其是要克服内心的恐惧。
When we arrived, the team went through a lot of trials, especially to overcome our fears.
但是经过十几天的工作，医护人员对于疾病的诊断和治疗已经有了进一步的了解，也积累了一些经验。
But after ten days of work, the medical staff have a better understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, but also accumulated some experience.
我们的医疗队负责金银潭医院北二楼和北三楼两个病区60余位病人，截至2月4日，已经有4例治愈出院。
Our medical team was responsible for more than 60 patients in the two affected districts on the second and third floors of the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital. As of February 4, four cases had been cured and discharged.
目前一线临床治疗的病人，我们每天都会分析所有的临床资料来决定我们的治疗方案。
At present, we analyze all clinical data to determine our treatment regimen for patients undergoing first-line clinical treatment.
从现在来看，重症的病人大概是在10%~20%的比例，国家卫建委的数据显示，全国新冠肺炎患者死亡率是2.1%，武汉的数据高一些，是4.9%。
From now on, the rate of serious cases is about 10% to 20%. According to the National Health and Construction Commission, the death rate is 2.1% in China and 4.9% in Wuhan.
80%的病人只要“早发现、早报告、早隔离、早治疗”，都可以取得一个非常好的治疗效果。
As long as 80% of patients "early detection, early reporting, early isolation, early treatment" can achieve a very good therapeutic effect.
对于确诊的病人来说，首先是要增强他的免疫力；其次是做一些对症的治疗。
For a confirmed patient, the first is to strengthen his immunity; the second is to do some symptomatic treatment.
在药物的选择上目前有一些新的方案，但是否有效还需要进一步的临床的询证医学证据，我们也在进一步观察。
There are new approaches to drug selection, but further clinical, evidential medical evidence is needed, and we are looking at it further.
另外，我们的医疗队目前救治的都是危重病人，有一个非常显著的表现，就是肺部受损明显、有明显的低氧血症，呼吸衰竭和伴多器官功能衰竭。
In addition, our medical teams are currently treating critically ill patients, and one of the most striking manifestations of this is evident lung damage, marked hypoxemia, respiratory failure and multiple organ failure.
我们会根据病人的病情——缺氧情况、呼吸衰竭的严重度来采取不同的呼吸支持的方法，包括鼻导管吸氧、高流量氧气治疗、气管插管、呼吸机、无创呼吸机、有创呼吸机甚至是肺复张或体外膜肺氧合（ECMO）等。
Depending on the patient's condition - hypoxia or respiratory failure - we use a variety of respiratory support methods, including nasal catheter oxygen uptake, high flow oxygen therapy, trachea intubation, ventilators, non-invasive breathing machines, invasive breathing machines and even pulmonary or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
郑军华（左二）和首批康复出院的患者合影新民周刊：目前金银潭医院医疗力量够吗？郑军华：金银潭医院目前是集中收治危重病人最多的医院，也集合了目前国内呼吸科、重症医学科的各路专家和精英，我们有三支各地来支援的医疗队，包括上海医疗队、北京医疗队、福建医疗队（接替陆军军医大学医疗队），同时有来自于武汉人民医院、同济医院和协和医院，还有国家级重症治疗专家组。
Zheng Junhua (second from left) and the first group of convalescent patients were photographed by Xinmin Weekly: Is this enough medical strength? Zheng Junhua: Gold and Silver Pool Hospital is the most intensive care center for critically ill patients in China.
我们共同来面对这个疾病，参与治疗。
We come together to confront this disease, to participate in treatment.
随着目前国家院士级专家还有各种行业内专家对于新型冠状病毒的认识不断加深，我们能够更好地掌握防控的特点，不断地了解这个疾病。
With the increasing understanding of the new coronavirus among national academicians and experts in various fields, we can better grasp the characteristics of the prevention and control and keep abreast of the disease.
李兰娟院士对于危重病人治疗提出的“四抗二平衡”的救治方案和国家第五版诊疗指南，我们也在学习和落实之中。
Academician Li Lanjuan for the treatment of critically ill patients put forward the "four antibody two balance" treatment plan and the fifth edition of the national diagnostic and treatment guidelines, we are also learning and implementing.
而我们医疗队在临床上的一些有关核酸检测的转阴特点和变化，也对我们治疗病人和判断病情，更好地做好防控工作提供了借鉴。
Some of the clinical features and changes of nucleic acid testing of our medical team can also be used as a reference for us to treat patients, judge the disease and better control work.
比如对于易感人群的判断，以前可能普遍认为是年纪大的，合并多种基础疾病的人为主，但现在相应增加了儿童和孕妇。
For example, the judgment of susceptible populations, which used to be generally accepted as being older, is now accompanied by an increase in the number of children and pregnant women.
目前，武汉市政府也对“四类人员”分类集中收治和隔离，特别是方舱医院的建设，相比于居家隔离，我相信对于疾病控制是能起到更积极的效果。
At present, Wuhan city government also centralized treatment and isolation of the "four categories of personnel," especially the construction of the square cabin hospital, I believe it will have a more positive effect on disease control than home isolation.
毕竟大多数家庭对于疾病防控的医学知识并不是非常了解，特别是防疫方面的消毒知识有限，所以武汉市的这一措施应当会对疫情发展起到关键作用。
After all, most families do not know much about disease prevention and control, especially the limited knowledge of disinfection in epidemic prevention, so this measure in Wuhan city should play a key role in the development of the epidemic.
《新民周刊》：目前我们医疗队的医护人员们工作状态怎么样？如何保证他们能够长期高效地工作？郑军华：我们的医疗队对于疾病的治疗，正在不断积累经验，我们也在不断改善我们的流程，找差距，补短板，持续改进。
At present, how are the medical staff of our medical team working well? How can they ensure their long-term and efficient work? Zheng Junhua: Our medical team is accumulating experience in the treatment of diseases.
我们要认识到疫情是有长期性、复杂性和严峻性的，我们也要充分地保护我们医护人员，有精力和体力去面对这样的挑战。
We need to realize that the epidemic is long-term, complex and severe, and we need to adequately protect our medical staff and have the energy and strength to face such challenges.
1月27日上海市卫健委为我们补充了50名护理成员，其中35名抽调到了金银潭医院其他病区，另外15名纳入了我们的一体化管理，负责两个病区的轮转。
On January 27, the Shanghai Fitness and Health Commission added 50 nursing staff, 35 of whom were transferred to other areas of Gold and Silver Pool Hospital. Another 15 were integrated into our integrated management and were responsible for the rotation of the two disease areas.
因为病区里没有护工，我们的护士不仅需要负责医学护理，还需要做生活护理。
Because there are no nurses in the area, our nurses are not only responsible for medical care, but also need to do life care.
所以在我们护理力量有所增加的情况下，把第一线最辛苦的护士岗位的工作时间，调整到了4小时一班，希望在这样的调整后，医护人员能够上得了战场，也能在工作结束后获得更多的休息。
So, as our nursing capacity has increased, we have moved the hours from the first-line, hardest-to-work nurse positions to four-hour shifts, in the hope that with such adjustments, health-care workers will be able to go to war and have more rest after work.
另外，为了让我们的医护人员能够长期高效地工作，我们也做了一些努力。
In addition, we have made some efforts to enable our health care workers to work efficiently and effectively in the long run.
我们建立了党总支，要求党员走在抗疫情的第一线，充分发挥党员的先锋模范作用和党支部的战斗堡垒作用。
We have established the Party General Administration, which requires Party members to take the front line in fighting the epidemic, give full play to the vanguard and exemplary role of Party members and the battle fort role of Party branches.
这次136名队员里面有59名党员，1名预备党员，我们召开了全体党员会议，上党课时，当场就有8名入党积极分子要求火线入党，会后到目前大概已经收到了40多名同志的入党申请。
This time, of 136 members, 59 are members and one is a reservist. We called a meeting of all Party members, and eight activists called for a line of fire during the party class.
1月28日晚，上海市援鄂医疗队举办全体党员第一次会议另外我们全体医护人员身心健康。
On the evening of January 28, the Shanghai Medical Team hosted the first meeting of all Party members.
我举两个例子。
Let me give two examples.
这两天，有一些过生日的队员，我们一起给他们搞了一个简单的仪式，过一个小型的生日，大家心里暖暖的，也稍微放松了一下。
These two days, there are some birthday party members, we have a simple ceremony for them, a small birthday, everyone's heart warm, but also a little relaxed.
另外，因为我们刚刚来的时候，有些女同志的头发比较长，不利于开展相关的防护措施，于是我们有一位女同志就自愿帮大家剪头发。
In addition, when we first arrived, some lesbian women had long hair, which was not conducive to the development of protective measures, so one of our lesbians volunteered for a haircut.
作为一个团队，我们相互尊重、相互关心、相互理解、相互支持。
As a team, we respect each other, care for each other, understand each other and support each other.
大家经过一段时间的磨合以后，应该说到了一个基本默契的阶段。
After a period of wear and tear, we should say a basic tacit understanding of the stage.
在物质保障方面，我们受到了来自上海市委、市政府、卫健委和申康医院发展中心的大力支持，特别是我们队员所在的医院的支持，也非常感谢来自于全国各地的企业、团体、基金会、个人给予我们的慰问和支持。
In terms of material support, we received strong support from the Shanghai Municipal Committee, the Municipal Government, the Wellness Commission and the Shenkang Hospital Development Centre, especially from the hospital where our team members are located, as well as from enterprises, organizations, foundations and individuals from all over the country.
这里面也可以讲一个事情，就是光明集团给我们所有在上海的家属送菜、送粮、送牛奶等等，我们队员家属也非常感动，非常感谢，还有上海市医务工会、盒马生鲜、美团、绿地等，我一下子说不全，总之，在社会各界的关心下，我们队员非常有信心去战胜疫情。
The members of the Lightning Group were very moved and grateful to all our family members in Shanghai. I am also very grateful to the Shanghai Medical Union, Boxed Horse Shengxian, US Mission and Green Space. In a word, under the concern of the community, our team members are confident to overcome the epidemic.
2月2日，上海援鄂医疗队的医务人员与市委书记李强视频连线《新民周刊》：疫情还在发展，我们的医护人员也工作了将近两周的时间，大概什么时候能够有轮替和休息呢？郑军华：我们觉得现在还不必要。
On February 2, the medical staff of the medical team in Shanghai and the Secretary of the Municipal Party Li Qiang attached a video link to Xinmin Weekly: The epidemic is still developing and our medical staff have been working for nearly two weeks.
因为我们也是刚刚到了没多久，大家也下了决心，既然来了，受到上海市政府的派遣，我们一定要把工作做好，我们没有想过后面轮换休息，这个时候也不应该马上就休息。
Since we have just arrived, we have made up our minds, and since we are here, dispatched by the Shanghai Municipal Government, we must do our job well.
我们还是应该战斗在第一线，况且我们这支队伍刚刚才开始熟悉和了解抗疫的相关经验。
We should still be on the front line, and our team has only just begun to become familiar with and understand the experience of fighting the epidemic.
新来的医疗队都有一个磨合的过程，我们目前形成一个团结协作的团队，我们更应该做的是把时间用于救治病人。
The new medical team has a process of attrition, we now form a team of solidarity, we should do is to devote time to the treatment of patients.
上海第三批援鄂医疗队的领队、瑞金医院陈尔真副院长说：不破楼兰誓不还。
Shanghai third medical team leader, Ruijin Hospital Chen Erzhen Vice-President said: do not break the Loulan oath not to return.
其实这也是我们的想法，我们一定会不辱使命。
In fact, this is our idea, we will live up to the mission.
《新民周刊》：在武汉工作的这两周里，您个人最大的感受是什么？郑军华：我内心有四点感受，非常深刻。
In the past two weeks working in Wuhan, what's your biggest personal feeling? Zheng Junhua: I have four feelings in my heart, very deep.
我最大的感受是，确实感到了我们党的坚强领导、我们社会主义制度的优势，也更加树立了四个意识，四个自信，坚定两个维护。
My biggest feeling is that I really feel the strong leadership of our Party and the strength of our socialist system.
现在武汉有8000多名来自于全国29个省市自治区的医疗队成员，同时还有来自于军方的医疗队。
Wuhan now has more than 8,000 members of medical teams from 29 provinces and autonomous regions, as well as medical teams from the military.
没有一个国家能够像中国那样有坚决的贯彻执行力。
No country can carry out the task with as much determination as China.
第二点，目前抗击疫情的防治体系正在形成过程中，身处历史之中的我们，确确实实感受到了我们政府的高效，刚开始可能对疫情有一个认识过程，但现在已经把抗击疫情作为一个最主要、最重要的工作在抓了。
Second, the prevention and control system to combat the epidemic is in the process of being formed. We in the course of history have truly felt the efficiency of our government. We may have had a process of understanding the epidemic at first, but we have made the fight against the epidemic a major and important task.
我接触到的当地区政府人员，他们为了保障我们的生活需要，做了最大的努力。
The people I spoke to from the local government did their best to protect our lives.
特别是对我们的住所、生活、通勤、安全等方面，也提供了全方面的后勤保障。
In particular, we provide a full range of logistical support for our accommodation, living, commuting, security, etc.
第三点，我也充分感受到了我们全国医务工作者的精神风貌。
Third, I also fully felt the spirit of our national medical workers.
在国家的号召下，没有一家医院，没有一个医务人员是退缩的，这也体现了医护人员的使命感、责任感——疫情就是命令。
At the call of the state, there was no hospital and no medical staff flinched, reflecting a sense of mission and responsibility on the part of the medical staff - an epidemic is a command.
第四点，就是我充分感受到了中国文化中“一方有难、八方支援”的精神。
Fourth, I have fully felt the spirit of "difficulty in one side and support for the eight sides" in Chinese culture.
很多的企业、团队、个人，在疫情发生以后都尽自己最大的力量提供支持。
Many enterprises, teams and individuals have done their best to provide support after the outbreak of the epidemic.
很多国外的华侨、留学生都想尽办法帮助解决我们医疗物资保障，特别是N95的口罩、医疗防护服、护目镜等等方面。
Many overseas Chinese and foreign students are trying their best to help us with medical supplies, especially N95 masks, medical suits, goggles, etc.
我们大家共同去抗击疫情，武汉，不是一个孤城，全国人民支持你们，这一点，我的感受是非常深的。
We all go together to fight the epidemic, Wuhan, is not a lonely city, the whole people support you, this point, I feel very deep.
