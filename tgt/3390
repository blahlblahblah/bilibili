我的朋友圈标语一直是《论语·雍也》中的一句话：己欲立而立人，己欲达而达人。
My circle of friends slogans has always been the "Analects Yong" in a sentence: the desire to stand up for people, has reached and reach people.
多少个夜晚，空无一人的街道，我在开车回家的路上，都在想，如果我们多付出一些，武汉会好得更快一些吗？还好，这一天，就快要来了。
How many nights, empty streets, I drive home, I thought, if we pay more, Wuhan will be better a little faster? Fortunately, this day, soon.
口述 | 罗　皓整理 |吴　雪大年三十，没有过年的氛围，更没有团圆饭，一大早，我发动了车子，奔驰在从湖南回武汉的高速路上，我紧握着方向盘，心里有股暖流在涌动。
At the beginning of the morning, I started my car. I gripped the steering wheel as I held the steering wheel, warm in my heart, at the end of the year when Wu Xue did not have the atmosphere of the New Year or the reunion dinner.
出发前，我早已知道武汉封城，朋友还专门打来电话嘱咐我：“皓子啊，现在武汉只能出不能进，你就别回来了。
Before I left, I already knew that Wuhan was closed. My friends called me and said, "Hao Zi, now Wuhan can only go out, you won't come back.
”我说：“不行，我必须得回，你就别管了。
"I can't," I said. "I've got to get it back.
”罗皓从湖南返回武汉高速路上我叫罗皓，是个90后，在新疆乌鲁木齐做市场工作，上班没几年，全国到处跑。
"Lo Hao, who returns to Wuhan Expressway from Hunan Province, is a 90-year-old man who works in the market in Urumqi, Xinjiang, where he has worked for a few years and travels around the country.
年前，回老家武汉开拓市场，接着又到了荆门、湖南。
Years ago, back home Wuhan market development, and then to Jingmen, Hunan.
回武汉这个决定，我没有丝毫纠结、犹豫。
Back to Wuhan this decision, I do not have the slightest entanglement, hesitancy.
我本可以躲在湖南宾馆里隔离休息，也本可以不用冒这么大的风险当志愿者，但我觉得一个热血男儿，那样子就真的“太怂了”。
I could have stayed at a hotel in Hunan Province to relax in isolation. I wouldn't have wanted to volunteer at such a great risk, but I think a hot-blooded man would have been "lost."
回到家后，父母见到我心里有了底，他们二老只有我一个孩子，我不在外漂泊而是居家隔离，他们会安心。
When I got home, my parents saw that I had a bottom in my heart. I was the only child they had.
但我的想法与他们不同，既然回来了，不能帮助医护人员救人，就想做点力所能及的事。
But unlike them, since I'm back, I can't help the paramedics save lives, so I want to do what I can.
初一晚上，我刷到一条朋友圈，是一个微信群二维码，进群后我接到了医护接送任务。
On the first night, I brushed a circle of friends, is a micro-group of two-dimensional code, after entering the group I received medical care.
罗皓和志愿者正在搬运物资我的父母内心善良，虽有担心，但也全力支持，很快我便联系上了对方，武汉因为交通管制，凌晨12点我出来办理通行证，正式成为了湖北抗疫公益志愿者。
Lo Hao and the volunteers are carrying materials My parents are kind in heart, and although worried, they all support me fully. Soon I got in touch with each other and Wuhan got out at 12 a.m. for traffic control and officially became a pro bono volunteer for the Hubei plague.
医护人员压力大，出行没有接驳，防护服和口罩都十分短缺。
Medical staff are stressed, travel is not connected, protective clothing and masks are in short supply.
1月27日，我接到一位医护人员上班通勤的求助，早上六点半立即赶往住处去接她，下车后，她一个劲儿地说谢谢，还塞给我一个N95的口罩和一瓶酸奶。
On January 27, I received a call from a paramedics commuter to work. At 6: 30 in the morning, I rushed to pick her up. After I got off, she kept saying thank you and shoved me a N95 mask and a bottle of yogurt.
医护人员送给罗皓的口罩和酸奶那天，我运送防护服、护目镜、接送医护人员、搬货卸货，从早上六点半干到晚上10点，回家的路上经过一个小区，我听到楼上居民此起彼伏的声音，细细听来大家都在喊四个字：武汉加油。
The day medical staff gave Lo Hao the masks and yogurt, I delivered protective clothing, goggles, paramedics and unloaded goods. On the way home from 6: 30 a.m. to 10: 00 p.m., I heard the voices of the residents above me.
我握着方向盘的手有点抖，一瞬间，眼泪扑簌簌地下来了。
I held the steering wheel hand a little shake, for a moment, tears down the rustle.
心里也在跟着说着：“武汉，加油啊。
The heart is also saying: "Wuhan, refueling ah.
”Play罗皓经过一个小区听到大家齐喊“武汉加油”，一瞬间，热泪盈眶志愿者的队伍越来越壮大，许多爱心企业也纷纷驰援武汉。
"Play Lo Hao passes by a neighborhood where they all shout" Wuhan Come on, "and in a flash the ranks of volunteers with tear-filled eyes get bigger and more and more loving enterprises are rushing to Wuhan.
2月1日，在滨湖社区，我把自己的小轿车当货车用，拖了一包又一包的白菜萝卜等蔬菜，那天我一个人搬了17件货，汗如雨下；2月6日，我送一批防护服到协和医院，正准备要帮他们搬进去，医生见到我赶紧打了手势制止：“离发热门诊远一点，不要进来。
On February 1, in the coastal community, I used my car as a van, towing bags and packets of Chinese cabbage and other vegetables. On February 6, I delivered a batch of protective clothing to Concorde Hospital, ready to help them move in.
”那天，我心里五味杂陈。
That day my mind was mixed.
协和医院医生正在接收防护服在一线奋战了40多天，从早忙到晚，最晚的时候忙到凌晨三四点，可能几天都没办法和父母打个照面。
Doctors at Concorde Hospital have been working on protective clothing for more than 40 days, from early morning to late morning, at the latest, and may not be able to meet their parents for several days.
吃饭也很随意，大多看情况解决，一些爱心人士会送些自热饭，爱心企业也会提供盒饭。
Eating is also very casual, mostly depending on the situation, some caring people will send some hot meals, love enterprises will also provide boxed rice.
许多个夜晚，我们就靠着车子，三五成群地扒拉几口；忙碌的时候，吃点面包、饼干垫一垫，也是常事。
Many nights, we lean against the car, pick up a few mouthfuls, busy time, eat bread, biscuits cushion, is also a common thing.
罗皓和志愿者靠着车子在街边填饱肚子2月20日，我的车子加了第11箱汽油，行驶公里数7000公里，医院的求助需求逐渐缓解，我们开始帮忙调配物资，分发物资，特别是一些捐赠有余的蔬菜、水果，开始分发到各个社区去。
With Lo Hao and the volunteers feeding themselves on the street side, my car was loaded with 11 cases of petrol for 7,000 kilometres and the hospital's need for help gradually eased. We began to help with the distribution of supplies, especially vegetables and fruits, which were in surplus and began to be distributed to the communities.
2月24日，我突然接到了一个沙女士的电话，我与她有一面之缘。
On February 24, I received a phone call from a Ms. Sha, with whom I met.
她说，70多岁的独居妈妈住在一个老旧小区，一天只吃一顿煮面条，家里什么菜也没有了，妈妈又不会像年轻人一样团购买菜，行动不便也找不到买菜的位置。
She says her 70-year-old mother, who lives alone in an old neighborhood, eats only one boiled noodles a day, has no food at home, and doesn't buy food in groups like a young man, nor can she move around and find places to buy food.
问我能不能帮忙买点菜送过去。
Ask me if I can get some food for you.
罗皓送给70多岁老人的蔬菜我当时就答应了，找到捐赠方，协调了一些剩下的包菜、竹笋、青菜送了过去。
Lo Hao sent vegetables to people in their 70s. I agreed then, found donors and coordinated the delivery of some of the remaining cabbage, bamboo shoots and vegetables.
老人拿到菜的时候，感激得都哭了。
The old man cried with gratitude when he got the food.
这是一件很小很小的事，当天我发布了朋友圈，谁知道，后面又有人发来相同的求助信息，我才发现，空巢老人的生活困难，是大范围存在的。
This is a very small thing, the day I released the circle of friends, who know, and then someone sent the same help message, I found that the empty nest elderly life is difficult, is a large-scale existence.
一次偶然的机会，在与一直做后勤保障服务的“代表月亮消灭病毒”志愿者联盟的冯丹丹联系时，得知她一个80后的女孩子，自筹资金买米买菜，一个人用一辆手推车送了铁机路保利城小区近50户空巢孤寡老人，我坐不住了。
When I contacted Von Dandan of the Alliance of Volunteers for the Elimination of the Virus, who has been providing logistics services, I learned that she was an 80-year-old girl who was self-financing to buy rice and a wheelbarrow carrying nearly 50 empty nests and elderly people to the Polly City quarter.
我们两个人一拍即合，盘算着一定要为这些老人做些什么。
The two of us clapped, wondering what we must do for the old people.
我们正式成立了一支武汉空巢老人服务小分队。
We officially set up a Wuhan empty nest elderly service team.
这个小分队有10多位核心成员和200多位爱心人士。
The team consists of more than 10 core members and more than 200 caring individuals.
我们的组织架构非常清晰，远在苏州的志愿者陶子一直为我们想方设法拉到赞助去帮扶那些困难群众，代表月亮消灭病毒的发起人90后女孩子月亮为我们志愿者提供全方位的后勤以及车队调动服务。
Our organizational structure is very clear, far away in Suzhou volunteers Tao Zi has been trying to find ways to help those in need, on behalf of the sponsors of the moon to eliminate the virus 90 girl Moon for our volunteers to provide a full range of logistics and convoy movement services.
还有志愿者主要负责协助社区摸排老人情况和需求，分发完成之后有志愿者负责回访，核实物资是否发放到位。
Volunteers are also primarily responsible for assisting communities in mapping the situation and needs of older persons, and when distribution is completed, volunteers undertake return visits to verify that supplies are delivered.
所有受捐赠的物资也有专人统计做账，定期公示。
All donated materials are also recorded by special people, regularly published.
我所带领的团队则是主要负责联系社会力量，进行物资的运输分发工作。
I lead the team is mainly responsible for linking up with social forces, the delivery of goods and distribution work.
这些需求都是一点点串联起来的，比如，开始服务的常青花园一社区，有130多户空巢老人，而这些老人还可以提供一些街坊邻居加入进来，每个社区会分派三到四个志愿者，分发的途径分为两种，一类是通过小区志愿者提供给老人，二类是按照社区网格员统计的名单发放。
These needs are linked together, for example, in a community called Evergreen Gardens, where more than 130 empty nests are served, and where the elderly can provide a small number of neighbours, three to four volunteers are assigned to each community, either through community volunteers or according to a list of community grid workers.
所有的物资每隔10天，都会有一个明细公示在群里，社区领多少，分发给了多少老人，一目了然。
Every 10 days, all the goods will be a detailed public in the group, the number of community, distributed to the number of elderly, at a glance.
我们还做了海报，一方面号召社会的捐赠，另一方面搜集老人信息。
We also put up posters calling for donations from the community on the one hand and collecting information on the elderly on the other.
现在15天左右，我们共搜集了3000多户空巢老人信息。
Now in 15 days or so, we have collected information on more than 3,000 empty nests.
3月3日，嘉鱼朴实的农家人冒雨采摘，运送了一卡车的蔬菜给我们，当送到一户84岁的老人家里时，老人家双手合十，鞠躬道谢，事后又发来微信：“因为有您，疫情不再可怕，世界变得温暖。
On March 3, the simple farmers of Jiayi picked up a truckload of vegetables, and when it was sent to an 84-year-old family, the old man bowed in his hands and thanked us. "Because of you, the epidemic is no longer terrible and the world is getting warmer.
”有时，你只是给他们一袋米、一些菜、一板鸡蛋，他们都能开心得像个孩子。
"Sometimes you just give them a bag of rice, some vegetables, a plate of eggs, and they can be as happy as a child.
我想，我们又是何德何能，让人家如此言谢。
I wonder what we are, and let others thank us for it.
嘉鱼农户正在采摘蔬菜一些特殊需求也会照顾到，比如婴幼儿、聋哑人等群体，我给婴儿送过棉布睡衣，为武汉滞留者送过煤气罐，大家也通过登记、文字、手语等接力为残疾人送过菜。
Garbage farmers are picking vegetables special needs, such as infants, deaf-mute groups, I sent baby cotton pajamas, for Wuhan stranded people sent gas cans, we also through registration, text, sign language and other relays for disabled people.
在我内心意愿里，是不愿意接受采访的。
I don't want to be interviewed in my mind.
你找我时，我想把更多时间放在为武汉做更多事情上。
When you came to me, I wanted to spend more time doing more things for Wuhan.
这是出于一个武汉人的本能，我们都希望武汉尽快好起来。
This is out of a Wuhan instinct, we all hope Wuhan as soon as possible to get better.
罗皓的朋友圈我还记得1月30日，我在朋友圈曾写下这段话：“曾经拥挤的街头，只剩下救护者疾驰而过，一方有难，八方支援，‘武汉加油’遍布街头！热心的武汉伢争着给医院给社区义务送物资！这或许就是所谓的英雄城市——我不认识你，但我谢谢你！”因为疫情的关系，公司还未复工。
Lo Hao's circle of friends I remember writing on January 30: "Once crowded streets, only the ambulance rushed past, assistance from all sides, 'Wuhan refueling' everywhere! The zealous Wuhan Carver for the hospital to volunteer supplies to the community!
而我却从未想过停止志愿服务，我和很多志愿者有一样的想法，疫情不退我们不退，我们要陪着武汉一起康复。
But I never thought to stop volunteering, I and many volunteers have the same idea, the epidemic does not retreat, we have to accompany Wuhan together to recover.
我的朋友圈标语一直是《论语·雍也》中的一句话：己欲立而立人，己欲达而达人。
My circle of friends slogans has always been the "Analects Yong" in a sentence: the desire to stand up for people, has reached and reach people.
多少个夜晚，空无一人的街道，我在开车回家的路上，都在想，如果我们多付出一些，武汉会好得更快一些吗？还好，这一天，就快要来了。
How many nights, empty streets, I drive home, I thought, if we pay more, Wuhan will be better a little faster? Fortunately, this day, soon.
