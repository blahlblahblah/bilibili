科普有两种，一种是把真的事情告诉你另外一种故弄虚玄把你带到沟里面去2月28日，上海市新冠肺炎医疗救治专家组组长、复旦大学附属华山医院感染科主任张文宏接受中新社、《中国新闻周刊》记者专访。
There are two kinds of popular science, one is to tell you the truth another kind of false mystery to take you to the ditch February 28, Shanghai Xinguan Pneumonia Medical Treatment Team leader, Fudan University affiliated with the Huashan Hospital Infection Director Zhang Wenhong accepted the China News Agency, China News Weekly.
中新社记者 汤彦俊 摄文/本刊记者 李鹏一个多月以来，张文宏大多数时间都“躲”在离市中心大约60公里的上海市公共卫生临床中心。
For more than a month, Zhang Wenhong has been "hiding" at the Shanghai Public Health Clinic, about 60 kilometers from the city centre.
在这个上海收治新冠肺炎确诊病例的定点医院，作为上海市新冠肺炎医疗救治专家组组长，这位复旦大学附属华山医院感染科主任每天都要查房，都要仔细研究300多个确诊病例，并一直在摸索新冠病毒的“脾气”。
The director of the infection department at Fudan University's Huashan Hospital, the designated hospital in Shanghai to treat confirmed cases of Newcrown Pneumonia, conducts daily house searches, examines more than 300 confirmed cases, and has been groping for the new crown virus's "temper."
28日，在华山医院，张文宏接受了中新社、《中国新闻周刊》记者的独家专访。
28, in Huashan Hospital, Zhang Wenhong accepted the news agency, "China News Weekly" exclusive interview.
“预测到了开始，却没有预测到结果”中国新闻周刊：您在复盘中提到，中国走出至暗时刻，世界似乎回到了武汉早期流行的时刻。
"Predicting the beginning, but not predicting the outcome," China News Weekly: You mentioned in your reply that China is coming out of the dark, and the world seems to have returned to the early days of Wuhan.
目前看来，是不是可以说新冠肺炎已经不可避免地全球大爆发？张文宏：武汉开始封城的时候，我记得当时说中国可能会出现三种情况：一种情况是如果都非常顺利的话，应该2到4个月我们应该可以把疫情控制住；第二种是比较胶着，大概6个月左右，我们把疫情控制住；第三种情况是说中国也控制不住，这个病在全球流行了。
Zhang Wenhong: When Wuhan began to close the city, I remember saying that China might have three scenarios: one in which we should be able to bring the outbreak under control in two to four months if all goes well; the other in which we brought the outbreak under control in about six months.
因为在2009年H1N1流感大流行的时候，美国就是这样的，一开始也是严防死守，到最后也没有控制住。
This was the case in the United States during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, and it was heavily guarded from the start, but was not contained in the end.
所以这次新加坡领导人接受采访的时候说，我们现在采取积极的防控策略，但是如果防不住，新加坡也就接受这个事实，就像流感一样，就让它流行，然后对重症的病人进行治疗。
So in an interview with Singapore's leaders, we're taking a proactive approach to prevention and control, but if we can't prevent it, Singapore accepts the fact, like the flu, to make it popular and then treat people who are seriously ill.
当时为这个疾病做预测有三种结局看上去胆子很大，事实上你一听就知道是没有错的，因为总归是最好、中等或者最差。
Predicting the disease at the time seemed daring in three ways, but in fact you knew it was right, because it was always the best, medium or worst.
但这次疫情确实出现奇怪的现象，现在中国的答卷交上来，确实2到 4个月有可能控制住，但是我们预测到了开始，却没有预测到结果。
But the epidemic did turn out strangely, and now that China's answers have been handed in, it is possible to contain them for two to four months, but we have predicted the beginning, but not the outcome.
一开始以为中国控制住，世界会没事，现在发现中国控制住了，世界出事了。
At first thought China was in control, the world was going to be okay. Now that China is in control, the world is in trouble.
现在全世界第一次出现全球新增的病例超过中国新增的病例，所以这就告诉我们，在全球出现了一些不好的苗头。
Now, for the first time in the world, there are more new cases worldwide than in China, so that tells us that there are some bad signs around the world.
我们也非常担心，现在中国控制了，世界出现了蔓延，这是非常令人忧虑的一件事情。
We are also very concerned that China is now in control and the world is spreading, which is a matter of great concern.
开始以为2到4个月控制住，这个事情就结束了，世界会因此变得美好，但现在看起来情况不是这样，后面留给中国和世界许多问题，都需要回答，还有很多工作是非常艰苦的。
At first thought it would take two to four months to get it under control, and the world would be better off for it, but it doesn't seem to be the case.
很多人就会问，其他高发病例的国家的人可不可以到你这来，原来你是高发病例，人家不让你过去，那现在反过来，人家发病病例多，回流怎么做呢？所以这些都会给我们将来疫情控制带来难点。
Many people will ask, other countries with high incidence of cases can come to you, you are a high incidence of cases, people will not let you go, then now, in turn, people more cases, how to do backflow? So these will bring us difficulties in future epidemic control.
“关于零号病人，我只认证据”中国新闻周刊：大家说目前还没有找到新冠肺炎“零号病人”，而有报道说新冠肺炎可能早就有了，基因族谱里新冠肺炎病毒有5个家族，中国只有其中一个家族，那么这是不是意味着新冠肺炎病毒并非起源于中国？张文宏：这是一个非常敏感的问题，但我始终坚持一定要有确切的依据。
About patient zero, I certify it only according to CHINA NEWSWEEK: It has been reported that there may be no new crown pneumonia, 5 families in the genealogy and only one family in China. Does that mean that the New Crown Pneumonia virus does not originate in China?
比如说这个病毒来自于哪里，一般来说看两个方面，第一，这个病毒出现的时间点，哪里最先出现的，要追究这个时间的先后；第二，要寻找他在进化树上面的位置，后面基因的进化是在前面的基础上。
First, where did the virus first appear, and where did it first appear? Second, to find out where he was on top of the evolutionary tree, where the later genes evolved.
所以，我认为应该仔细地把这两件事情放在一起来考虑，应该避免在证据不充足的时候随意发布消息。
So I think we should carefully put these two things together and avoid releasing information when there is not enough evidence.
上海出现确诊病例后，我们课题组对上海的病毒株做了全基因组的测序，我们的结论跟世界卫生组织的那个结论是一致的，上海的病例是从武汉传过来，传过来以后哪怕有第二代也没有出现变异。
After a confirmed case in Shanghai, our team sequenced the entire genome of the virus strain in Shanghai, and our conclusions are consistent with the WHO conclusion that the case in Shanghai was transmitted from Wuhan, with no second-generation mutation since then.
所以这次在中国大地上，流行的就是这一株。
So this time in the land of China, the popular is this one.
那你今天要问我，世界上有没有其他冠状病毒在流行，出现在哪里？什么时间节点出现，这些数据都要有非常坚实的测序的结果，而且必须在国际上发表。
So today you're going to ask me if there are any other coronavirus in the world, where they are and when they appear, these data have to be very firmly sequenced and published internationally.
大家都在苦苦追寻“零号病人”，一说“零号病人”显得非常有戏剧性。
Everyone is struggling to find Patient Zero, and the story of Patient Zero is very dramatic.
这个只是流行病学上的一些证据，事实上还有非常重要的是关于病毒起源的证据是什么呢？通过全基因组测序，我们发现这个病毒的遗传进化上肯定属于蝙蝠冠状病毒来源，这次这个病毒和蝙蝠携带的冠状病毒就是一家的，因此也引起了部分类似2003年SARS样的临床表现。
What is the evidence for the origin of the virus? By sequencing the entire genome, we discovered that the virus must have been genetically derived from the bat coronavirus, which this time belonged to the same family as the bat-borne coronavirus, thus giving rise to some clinical manifestations similar to those of SARS in 2003.
既然已经非常清晰它来自于蝙蝠携带的冠状病毒，那蝙蝠是在这个海鲜市场上带到人间，还是在隔壁县里的市场上带到人间，最后又传到这个市场，并在这个市场上暴发，你觉得有意义吗？我认为随意的猜测是不负责任的，做科普不是这么做的。
Since it has become clear that it comes from the coronavirus carried by bats, do you think it makes sense that the bat was brought to the world from this seafood market, or from the market in the next county, and finally to this market, and that it would be irresponsible to speculate at random, which is not what the popular science does.
科普有两种，一种是把真的事情告诉你，另外一种故弄虚玄把你带到沟里面去。
There are two kinds of popular science. One is to tell you the truth, the other is to take you into the ditch.
所以我个人觉得将来在这方面应该是中国一些极具权威的、大家信得过的一些科研机构，把这个事情给说清楚，我觉得这个是非常关键的，而不是任由这种随意的信息在传播。
So I personally think in the future it should be some authoritative and trusted scientific institution in China, and I think it is very important to make this clear, rather than allow this kind of random information to spread.
否则我作为普通的民众，也会给我造成很多困扰，是不是有什么事情隐瞒着我？关于“零号病人”，到今天为止我不信任何人说的，我只认证据，只认我们自己做出来基因测序的结果。
Otherwise, as a common people, I will cause a lot of trouble, is there anything hidden from me? About "patients zero," I do not believe anyone to date, I only authenticate the evidence, only to do our own genetic sequencing results.
“脾气搞清楚了就不会觉得它是非常妖”中国新闻周刊：很多人说这次的新冠病毒“比较妖”，关于潜伏期长短、传播力大小、传播途径的确认等有很多说法，还存在潜伏期能传播、愈后复阳等现象，到目前为止，三个多月了解一种新的传染病是不是时间太短？张文宏：很多人现在都喜欢用“非常妖”这个词来描述新冠病毒。
Many people have said that the new crown virus is "more demon" and that the incubation period can spread, the spread of the virus is confirmed. So far, more than three months have known whether a new infectious disease is too short.
你们很长一段时间希望能够采访我，我其实一直躲在一个地方，就是上海的治疗救治点。
You have been hoping to interview me for a long time, but I have been hiding in one place, the treatment point in Shanghai.
我躲在那里干什么呢？就是看上海的300多个病人，每天都要查房。
What am I doing there? I see more than 300 patients in Shanghai, checking their rooms every day.
今天这里采访结束以后，我马上得赶过去。
After the interview here today, I have to get there right away.
我们一直在看这个病，一直在摸索新冠病毒的脾气，脾气搞清楚了以后，你就不会觉得它是非常妖的一个病毒。
We have been watching the disease, has been groping for the new crown virus temper, temperament clear, you will not feel it is a very demon virus.
事实上它就是冠状病毒家族的一个病毒，只不过脾气跟别的冠状病毒略有不同。
In fact, it is a coronavirus family virus, only temper slightly different from other coronavirus.
它的排毒的时间可能跟你预想的稍微有点不一致，但是谁告诉你它排毒只排两个礼拜呢？谁告诉你每个病毒排毒的时间都是一样的呢？谁也没有说过，只是你自己这么认为而已，所以对于这样一个病毒，我们认为它妖，是因为我们可能还没有完全了解。
The time it takes to detoxify may be a little out of line with what you might have expected, but who told you that it's only been detoxifying for two weeks? Who told you that each virus detoxifies for the same time? No one said it, only you think so, so for such a virus, we think it is because we may not fully understand it.
这一次的冠状病毒我们看到它没有SARS病毒那么严重。
This time we saw that the coronavirus was not as serious as the SARS virus.
世界卫生组织说它的一个基本传播数是2.0到2.5之间，传播的力度已经超过了SARS，那它为什么会超过SARS，最重要原因就是SARS病人生病以后，体温非常高，同时会出现重症。
The most important reason why the World Health Organization (WHO), which says it has a base transmission between 2.0 and 2.5 and has spread beyond SARS, is that SARS patients have very high body temperatures and serious illnesses.
这种情况下你可能会识别，但这次新冠病毒病人是轻症的，早期没有症状的时候，你就不能识别他，那它就可能在这个阶段传播开来，所以它的一个传播速度就很快。
You might be able to identify it in this case, but this time the new crown virus patient is mild, you can't recognize him when there are no early symptoms, so it may spread in this phase, so it spreads quickly.
而且我们也看到全国的数据，最主要是聚集性传播，家庭传播占了百分之七十几，这个数字还是非常高的。
And we also see the national data, the most important is concentrated sexual transmission, family transmission accounted for more than 70 percent, this figure is still very high.
像这种密切接触的传播，是这次冠状病毒传播的一个主要特点，它的传播可以说是非常厉害。
Communication such as this close contact is a major feature of this coronavirus transmission, its spread can be said to be very strong.
它的特点是什么呢？有一点像SARS以肺炎为主的，也比较重，但是传播有一点像流感，它的特性介于SARS和流感之间，所以你只能说它是一个比较有个性的冠状病毒。
What are its characteristics? A bit like SARS, pneumonia, is also heavy, but spread a little like influenza, its characteristics between SARS and influenza, so you can only say that it is a relatively personality coronavirus.
我们中国现在称它是新型冠状病毒肺炎，国际是叫它“2019冠状病毒病”。
We in China now call it the new coronavirus pneumonia, internationally known as "2019 coronavirus disease."
随着对这个疾病认识的加深，我们其实就应该把这个病直接叫“2019年冠状病毒病”。
As we learn more about the disease, we should actually call it "2019 coronavirus disease."
它不仅仅是个肺炎，因为很多病人并没有没有肺炎的表现。
It's not just pneumonia, because many patients don't show symptoms of pneumonia.
没有肺炎的表现，你就不能叫它肺炎，实际上就是一个冠状病毒感染。
Without pneumonia, you can't call it pneumonia. It's actually a coronavirus infection.
有一些重症病人，它的损害也不单单是一个肺的损害，它还有心脏的损害，还有多脏体的损害，所以它是一个整体的病。
There are serious cases where the damage is not only a lung injury, but also heart damage and multi-organ damage, so it is a whole disease.
“再说可防可治，你认为还是一句笑话吗？”中国新闻周刊：随着专家组对新冠肺炎有更多的了解，是不是觉得新型冠状病毒其实没那么可怕？张文宏：大家觉得这个病很可怕，可怕是因为新的病毒你不认识。
What's more, do you think it's a joke? CHINA NEWSWEEK: As the panel learned more about the new coronavirus, didn't it think the new coronavirus was not so terrible? Zhang Wenhong: Everybody thought it was terrible because you didn't know the new virus.
今天我们上海已经治愈出院的病人279，总的病人337，已经达到一个83%的出院率。
Today, we in Shanghai have cured 279 patients discharged from the hospital. The total number of patients 337 has reached an discharge rate of 83%.
上海1月20号确诊第一例患者，我是小年夜去上海公卫中心工作的，所以也就是一个月，现在你看83%的病人出院了，治愈了。
The first case was diagnosed on January 20th in Shanghai. I went to work at Shanghai Public Health Center on New Year's Eve.
所以从这一点来看，这个病我们今天说它是可治的你同意不同意？上海一开始有这个病的时候，英国《柳叶刀》杂志预测说上海最坏的情况是，春节前武汉封城以后，很多人还会进来，上海的航班进来是全中国最多的，所以它当时把上海的风险排第一位。
So from this point of view, we say it is treatable today Do you agree or disagree? When Shanghai first had the disease, the British Lancet magazine predicted the worst would be that many people would come in before the Spring Festival, with Shanghai having the highest number of flights in the country, so it put Shanghai first.
上海进来的人数算上武汉的发病率，传播力按2.0到2.5之间这样的数传播，上海如果不加以防控，我们应该有80万人被感染，就算你防控的还不错，我们上海应该最后有8万人被感染。
If Shanghai is not controlled, we should have 800,000 people infected. Even if your prevention and control are not bad, we in Shanghai should end up with 80,000 infected.
那现在我们看上海流进来的病例200多，还有是跟武汉的接触被感染的。
Now we see more than 200 cases in Shanghai, and the contact with Wuhan has been infected.
我们把上海的基本上每一个病人的流行病学史都已经摸清楚了，在上海的病例要么是武汉进来的，要么武汉进来跟他们接触的，就这两个。
We know the epidemiological history of almost every patient in Shanghai, and the cases in Shanghai were either brought in by Wuhan, or Wuhan came into contact with them, only two.
上海找不到传播源头的病例，现在基本上没有，就是说所有进来的或者相关的，我们都控制住了。
There were no cases of transmission in Shanghai, and they are almost non-existent, which means that we have all the in-coming or related cases under control.
3000万人的城市，进来这么多疑似的病人，按它的数学模型，最好的结果是有8万人感染，而现在上海发病的337。
In a city of 30 million, with so many paranoid patients, the best result, according to its mathematical model, is that 80,000 people are infected, and now Shanghai has 337.
从这种防控的模式来讲，中国给出了一个非常强大的模式。
In terms of this control model, China offers a very powerful model.
实际上医生跟防控没有大的关系，医生是治病嘛，我们医生做的是发现病人，把病人诊断出来，这个对我们预防是很重要的，因为你不诊断不隔离就不行。
In fact, doctors have nothing to do with prevention. Doctors treat diseases. What we doctors do is find patients and diagnose them, which is important for our prevention, because you can't do it without diagnosis and isolation.
我们从外地过来，社区对他14天居家的隔离，这个也非常重要。
We're out of town, and the community's isolation of his 14-day home is also very important.
大家都知道新加坡做得好，原因是什么？你从外地回来，从有发病的这些国家过来的，你都要在家里自我隔离14天。
Everybody knows that Singapore is doing well, and why? You come back from other places, from these countries where there is a disease, and you isolate yourself at home for 14 days.
你如果不居家隔离14天，私自出去了，在新加坡会有什么结果你们知道的，犯法了。
If you don't stay at home for 14 days and go out without permission, what will happen in Singapore You know, breaking the law.
上海怎么做？上海靠我们的居委会干部，靠我们社区的管理，靠民众的自觉。
Shanghai depends on our neighborhood committee cadres, on the management of our community, on the awareness of the people.
所以从今天防治的结果来看，你说这个病可以不可以预防？337个确诊病例，一个月里有83%的人出院了，今天我们回过头来，再说可防可治，你认为还是一句笑话吗？不是的。
So judging from the results of today's treatment, do you think the disease can be prevented? Of the 337 confirmed cases, 83% were discharged in a month.
我就觉得只要整个国家的所有人，大家能够团结起来，把这件事情作为一个非常重要的事情去做，这个病的可防可治就是做得到的。
I feel that as long as all the people in this country can get together and do it as a very important thing, it is possible to prevent and cure the disease.
这个疾病也传到世界的其他地方，排名比较靠前的几个国家是韩国、意大利、日本，还有新加坡，实际上我们将来比较他们的防疫策略，对这个疾病的防控到底可以做到什么程度。
The disease has spread to other parts of the world. The top countries are South Korea, Italy, Japan and Singapore. In fact, we will compare their vaccination strategies in the future to see how far we can go in controlling the disease.
我们团队今天也会在我们的华山感染公众号上面发布文章，对几个国家的防疫策略和效果跟我们中国上海的防疫策略和效果进行比较，那么这个比较结果对于我们在下一步制定上海的策略就会非常重要。
Our team will also post an article today on our Huashan Infected Public, comparing the vaccination strategies and effects of several countries with those of our counterparts in Shanghai, China.
所以我们讲可防可治一定是要针对自己的国家和地区，有一个非常好的一个防控策略，我们才有可能把疫情控制掉。
So we say that preventable and treatable must be aimed at their own countries and regions, there is a very good prevention and control strategy, we can control the epidemic.
中国的经验不一定适合于新加坡，也不一定适合于日本，他们的策略也不一定适合我们。
China's experience is not necessarily appropriate for Singapore, nor for Japan, nor is their strategy necessarily appropriate for us.
但是传染病传播的最本质的东西是一样的，传染源如何控制，传播途径如何切断，易感染人群如何保护，这个是一样的。
But the essential thing in the spread of infectious disease is the same: how to control the source of infection, how to cut it off, how to protect vulnerable populations.
接下去每个国家都要根据自己的国情和卫生体系，来制定适合自己国家的防控策略。
Each country then has to tailor its prevention and control strategies to its own circumstances and health system.
“不能太寄希望于药物和疫苗可以带来神一样的结果”中国新闻周刊：所以说这病可防可治，其实很大程度上并不是取决于疫苗和用药，而是在如何防控上？您认为疫苗和特效药什么时候能研发出来？会不会不仅现在没有“神药”，将来也找不到“解药”？张文宏：现在有很多人在做疫苗和药，要让我现在去判断它什么时候出来，因为我没有掌握一手的材料，我认为我很难去判断。
So when do you think vaccines and specific drugs will be developed? Zhang Wenhong: There are a lot of people making vaccines and drugs, so I think it's very difficult for me to judge when it will come out because I don't have the first-hand information.
但是有一点比较明确，作为一个冠状病毒，SARS结束以后我们也没有看到有效的疫苗或者药物，现在仍然在中东病区流行的MERS，它也是一个冠状病毒，药物和疫苗这么多年也没有做出来。
But one thing is clear: as a coronavirus, we did not see an effective vaccine or drugs after SARS ended. MERS, which is still prevalent in the Middle East, is also a coronavirus and drugs and vaccines have not been available for so many years.
所以我们只能说，做药物和疫苗可能还是比较困难的一件事情。
So we can only say that making drugs and vaccines may still be a difficult thing.
哪怕我们今天进展的非常顺利，真要拿到第一个疫苗，我估计要年底了。
Even if we go really well today and really get the first vaccine, I expect to be at the end of the year.
但是大家始终要有一个非常清晰的概念，你认为疫苗和药物有了，你就搞定这个疫情了？其实不是这个样子的，我给你举一个例子，就是说流感，有药物吗？有药物而且不止一种，也很有效，但流感是不是每年都爆发？有药物就能解决传染病的一切吗？解决不了。
But always have a very clear concept, you think the vaccine and drugs, you have to deal with the epidemic? In fact, not like this, I give you an example, that is, influenza, drugs? There are drugs and more than one, also very effective, but does influenza erupt every year? Is there a drug that can solve all infectious diseases?
流感有没有疫苗，有疫苗是不是，解决问题了吗？没有解决问题，所以传染病的预防和控制是一个体系的问题，并不是说你今天疫苗或者药物就能解决，还要看是什么病毒，疫苗和药物的效果怎么样，覆盖率怎么样，这些都是一个问题。
Is there a vaccine, is there a vaccine, is it a problem? There is no solution, so the prevention and control of infectious diseases is a systemic problem, not just what you can do with vaccines or drugs today, but also what viruses, vaccines and drugs can do, and how much coverage there is.
疫苗或者药物你说重要不重要？我认为非常重要。
Vaccines or drugs Don't matter what you say? I think it's very important.
无论是疫苗或者药物，对我们中国解决这一次的疫情我认为是来不及的，但是对世界上其他国家和地区下一步的疫情会有用，对我们中国将来自己面临的可能流行会有用，所以我们现在不应该停止对疫苗和药物的研发，但是不能把自己所有的希望全部寄托在疫苗和药物的研发上面，至少对冠状病毒是这样。
Whether vaccines or drugs, I think it is too late for us in China to solve this epidemic, but it will be useful to other countries and regions of the world in the future. So we should not stop developing vaccines and drugs now, but we should not place all our hopes on the development of vaccines and drugs, at least for coronavirus.
不同病毒的特点不一样，像有一些病毒你全球进行接种这个病就没了，天花就没有了是吧。
Different viruses have different characteristics. Like some viruses you inoculate all over the world. Smallpox is gone, right?
所以这个情况不一样，短期内这个病的防控，我们还是不能太寄希望于药物和疫苗可以带来神一样的结果，我们现在还仍然寄希望于我们中国广大民众的力量，坚决执行我们现在的防控策略，巩固现阶段的这个成果，把这个新型冠状病控制住。
So the situation is different, short-term prevention and control of the disease, we can not hope that drugs and vaccines can bring about the same results, we still hope that we Chinese people will firmly implement the current strategy of prevention and control, consolidate the achievements of this stage, and control this new coronary disease.
“响应等级下降，但警觉性不能下降”中国新闻周刊：我们已经有一个多月是非常高强度的防控，现在有些省份已经降低疫情防控响应等级了，您认为要满足什么样的条件，上海的防控等级可以适当降低？张文宏：中国很多地方都开始降低响应等级了，响应等级降或者不降，涉及的是方方面面的问题，实际上我的知识储备和积累，是回答不了这个问题的。
"Response levels are down, but vigilance is not going down" China News Weekly: We have had a very high level of control for more than a month now, and some provinces have reduced their response levels.
但我可以明确告诉你，上海和其他地方不一样。
But I can make it clear to you that Shanghai is different from other places.
我是浙江人，浙江过年前是危险很大的，因为浙江很多人去武汉都回来了，过完节都是出去的，做生意的人出去了，打工的人也出去了，而进来的人其实不是从武汉过来的。
I am a Zhejiang, Zhejiang before the New Year is very dangerous, because Zhejiang many people go back to Wuhan, after the festival is out, the business people go out, the workers also go out, and the people who come in are not really from Wuhan.
过节以后的输入人数，上海是1500万到2000万的输入进来，现在如果非常草率地降低响应等级，后面你得考虑一系列问题。
With 15 to 20 million entries coming in after the holiday season, you now have to consider a series of questions if you're going to downgrade your response very rashly.
所以我个人觉得，上海什么时候降级还不是一个上海自己能够回答的问题，我猜测上海还是跟中央一起在联动，像上海、北京这种超大型城市，在经济、政治上具有极其重要地位的城市，它的考虑跟其他的省市是不一样的。
So I personally feel that the question of when to demote Shanghai is not one that Shanghai can answer on its own. I suspect that Shanghai is still working with the central government, and that cities like Shanghai and Beijing, which are extremely important economically and politically, have different considerations from other provinces and cities.
但这不代表上海不复工了，不代表不搞经济了。
But this does not mean that Shanghai does not resume work, does not mean do not engage in economic.
今天早上我看路上很堵了，我堵在延安路高架开不进来，我知道这个城市开始进行经济复苏了。
This morning I saw that the road was blocked. I couldn't get into the viaduct on Yanan Road. I knew the city was beginning to recover economically.
经济复苏不代表我们现在防疫的等级或者我们的警惕性要下降。
Economic recovery does not mean that we are now on a vaccination scale or that we are less vigilant.
现在我们各个医院发热门诊的筛查，事实上比前一段时间做得更加紧。
The screening of fever clinics in our hospitals is now, in fact, more intensive than it was some time ago.
这个时候并不是说我们整个城市新增病例是零就是好的，如果是零我倒是很担心的，这么多人进来怎么会是零呢。
This is not to say that our city is zero new cases is good, if it is zero I am worried, so many people come in how can it be zero.
我们在这个城市发现了一例或者两例，或者三例，我认为这都是可喜的，我指的是输入性的，输入性的病例你发现的越多，我们城市就越安全。
We've found one or two cases, or three cases, in this city, and I think that's good. I mean, the more imported cases you find, the safer our city is.
接下去的一段时候里面，响应的等级有可能全国各地都下降，但是我们的警觉性不能下降。
For some time to come, the level of response is likely to drop across the country, but our alertness must not decrease.
这一块要非常的明确，这个事情不是政府一家的事，跟你每一家都有关系。
This one should be very clear, this matter is not the government alone, with each of you have a relationship.
我们自己要有高度的警惕性，从外地回来我们要两个星期的自我隔离，然后到单位去上班。
We need to be very vigilant ourselves, we need two weeks of self-isolation when we get back from the field, and then we go to work.
其实还是不鼓励密接度非常高的这种情况，或者说口罩完全可以摘掉。
In fact, it is not encouraged that the density of this situation is very high, or masks can be removed completely.
我在想上海大概什么时候会把口罩摘掉？可能要看到所有返回上海的人，基本上都来了，都已经复工了，然后我们上海没有发现新的病人，我估计这个时间点，就是我们把口罩全部摘掉的时间点，那到底是什么时候呢，估计最近几个礼拜可能还得先看一下。
I wonder when Shanghai will probably take off its mask? Probably all the people who have returned to Shanghai have basically come back and gone back to work. Then we haven't found any new patients in Shanghai.
“上海的防控体系很好，属于少林派”中国新闻周刊：您还提到一个“佛系管控”概念，我们应该如何在“强势管控”和“佛系管控”间寻找平衡？张文宏：很多人认为新加坡是佛系管控，什么叫佛系管控？新加坡现在是橙色等级，其实它并没有叫每个人都戴口罩，也没有限制社区的活动，而且还告诉你，我现在就是这么防控，防的住就防，防不住我们就把它当流感来处理，重的病人我给你治疗，轻的病人你就居家隔离。
"The control system in Shanghai is very good and belongs to the Shaolin faction." CHINA NEWSWEEK: You also mentioned a concept of "Buddhism control" and how should we find a balance between "strong control" and "Buddhist control"?
大家看新加坡，感觉不是很积极，事实上新加坡可积极了，你如果从武功上面来讲，上海现在的防控体系很好，我们是属于什么派门的，我们属于少林派，非常干净有力，社区防护强大无比。
In fact, if you speak of martial arts, Shanghai now has a very good control system. What kind of group do we belong to? We belong to Shaolin school.
新加坡属于武当派的，你表面上看不出来，而且是非常佛系，但它内部是非常厉害的。
Singapore is a Wudang sect. You don't seem to see it, and it's very Buddhist, but it's very powerful inside.
你知道新加坡是几号开始管控的吗？新加坡是1月2号就开始管控了。
Do you know what number Singapore began to regulate? Singapore began to regulate on January 2nd.
中国的专家组一到武汉，新加坡就开始对中国飞过来的飞机全面进行防控，后来武汉进来的人员签证都不给了。
As soon as the Chinese team arrived in Wuhan, Singapore began to exercise full control over the planes coming from China, and then no visas were granted to those entering Wuhan.
疫情来的时候，它很早就开始管控了,时间点是非常早的，然后进来的病人数就很少，到现在为止一百个都不到。
When the outbreak came, it began to be controlled early, at a very early stage, and then the number of people who came in was very low, less than a hundred so far.
这么大的一个城市，然后进来就是几十个，所以它认为这个密度是很低的。
So large a city, and then come in dozens, so it thinks the density is very low.
这么低的密度，如果每个人都戴口罩，口罩防御的效率就是很低的，因为你根本就没有机会碰到这样的人。
At this low density, if everyone wears a mask, mask defense is inefficient because you never get to meet such a person.
你没有机会碰到这样的人，你戴口罩不是浪费吗。
You don't get to meet such people. Don't you waste your mask?
但最大的一个问题新加坡有口罩吗，它没口罩，又不能生产口罩，你想人家还能戴什么呢？新加坡是把口罩留给医生，医生要保障。
But one of the biggest problems is that Singapore has a mask. It doesn't have a mask and it can't make one. What else do you think people can wear?
所以我老早就讲了，我们应该把N95留给医生，但是我们自己拼命戴N95口罩，也不知道为什么。
So I said long ago that we should leave N95 to the doctor, but we ourselves desperately wear N95 masks, and do not know why.
新加坡采取的策略是你外地回来的居家隔离14天，你敢出来法律在那等你。
Singapore's strategy is to stay away from home for 14 days, and you dare to come out there and wait for you.
其次是新加坡的发热门诊覆盖率，上海的发热门诊是110家，北京是76家，新加坡你知道是多少家吗？800家！疫情一来以后，它马上就启动社区医疗防控体系，都可以收这种发热病人，然后按它的流程来走。
Then there is the fever clinic coverage in Singapore, 110 in Shanghai and 76 in Beijing. Do you know how many are there in SINGAPORE? 800! Immediately after the outbreak, it launched the Community Healthcare Prevention and Control System, which can take the fever patients and follow its procedures.
新加坡这么小的一个地方，800家可以收发热的，所以你说人家是佛系，你搞笑呢，人家一点也不佛系，看上去佛系，人家是武当派。
Singapore is such a small place, 800 can collect heat, so you say people are Buddhism, you are funny, people are not buddhism at all, it looks like Buddhism, people are Wudang.
我们现在采取的策略对我们中国是最有利的。
The strategy we are adopting is in the best interests of our country, China.
新加坡的防控也非常成功，所以我今天会有一幅图画出来，新加坡和上海的新增病例，都是输入的，非常的一致，你表面上看上去一模一样的。
Singapore's control has also been very successful, so I will have a picture today of new cases in Singapore and Shanghai, all of which are input, very consistent, and you look exactly alike.
但是它们用的武功完全不一样的，我们用的是少林派的武功，它用的是武当派的武功，但是结果都是那么的漂亮，所以我们上海也好，中国的很多城市也好，下一阶段我们要做什么的，下一步我们就是要练内力的。
But they use different martial arts, we use Shaolin, it uses Wudang martial arts, but the results are so beautiful, so we in Shanghai and many Chinese cities, what we will do in the next stage, we are going to practice our internal strength.
第一阶段我们用的是武功是硬派的武功，接下去下面就要练内力，我相信中国的下一阶段一定会做得非常好。
In the first stage, we use martial arts skills which are hard-line. Next, we need to practice our inner strength.
因为最主要的一个原因，我相信中国政府的改变的力量，事实上改变的力量没有哪一个国家可以比中国更加强大。
Because of one of the main reasons I believe the power of change in the Chinese government, in fact no country can be more powerful than China.
“感染科要非常强大，我们的民族才是安全的”中国新闻周刊：人们平时到医院，都尽量远离传染病房，现在因为疫情，大家对传染病的关注度大增，您作为主任的华山医院感染科有中国最强的感染病学团队，您当初上大学为什么选择了感染病学？张文宏：对我个人你不要采访，我觉得没什么意思。
Now, because of the epidemic situation, there has been a great deal of interest in infectious diseases. As your director of the Infection Department of Huashan Hospital, you have the strongest infectious diseases team in China. Why did you choose infectionology at university? Zhang Wenhong: Personally, I don't think it's interesting.
我就一个乡下人跑到上海，读完书留下来工作而已，你讲到感染科我给你多讲一点。
I went to Shanghai by a hick and stayed to work after reading a book. I'll tell you more about the infection department.
大家认为传染病不重要的时候，我们这个科室就是一直保持着非常强大的一个体系。
When infectious diseases are considered unimportant, our department has always maintained a very strong system.
我们科最早的创始人是戴自英教授，英国牛津大学毕业的，他的导师是青霉素的发明者之一。
Our earliest founder was Professor Dai Zhiying, a graduate of Oxford University in England. His mentor was one of the inventors of penicillin.
他回来把抗菌药物的治疗，把抗病毒的治疗整个理念带进来了，所以从那个时候开始，我们的理念就一直是关注传染性、感染性疾病。
He came back to bring in the whole idea of antibacterial drugs, antiviral treatment, so from then on, our idea has been to focus on infectious, infectious diseases.
这么多年来，华山感染科始终保持非常强大的一个自我成长的动力。
Over the years, the Department of Infection in Huashan has always been a very strong force for self-growth.
我的导师是翁心华教授，他是戴自英老师的学生，2003年的时候是上海SARS医疗救治专家组的组长。
My supervisor is Professor Weng Xin-hua, a student of Dai Zhiying, who was the head of the Shanghai SARS Medical Treatment Expert Group in 2003.
我们科室一直认为，人类实际上是不可能远离传染性疾病的，因为我们生活在自然界，自然界有很多微生物，它们在这个世界上的历史比人类长很多，人类从古猿进化也就是几百万年，现代人类从非洲走出来也就是10万年，但微生物在这个世界上存活了几亿年，在我们的环境当中到处都是，你随便就会发现很多微生物的跨物种的转播。
Our department has always believed that it is virtually impossible for humans to be free of infectious diseases, because we live in nature, there are many microbes in the world, they have evolved much longer than humans, from ancient apes to millions of years, from modern humans to 100,000 years, but microorganisms have survived the world for hundreds of millions of years, and you can easily find transspecies transmissions of many micro-organisms in our environment.
前一段时间我们在脑膜炎病人当中，找到猪疱疹病毒，后来突然就发现中国很多地方都有这个病毒，本来在猪里面的疱疹病毒怎么跑到人身上去了？还有从非洲过来的一个病人，昏死过去了，我们查出来是非洲的锥虫病，中国都没有药，我们在24小时内找到虫子，48小时内全基因组测序，然后72小时从日内瓦找到药。
Some time ago, we found the virus in meningitis patients, and then suddenly we found it in many parts of China, and a patient from Africa passed out. We found African trypanosomiasis. China has no medicine. We find bugs in 24 hours, complete genome sequencing in 48 hours, and medicines from Geneva 72 hours later.
这是输入性疾病的一个速度，如果放慢了，你就没有机会了。
This is a rate of input disease, and if you slow down, you won't have a chance.
这一次新型冠状病毒总体上来讲还是暴露出很多问题。
On the whole, the new coronavirus has revealed many problems.
一个新发展传染病出来的时候，你有没有很强的识别能力，除了警报以外能不能迅速把这个东西给鉴定出来。
When a newly developed infectious disease comes out, do you have a strong sense of ability to quickly identify it other than the alarm?
这个病原体的鉴定非常快，一个礼拜就鉴定了，但是我的意思是之前已经有很多警报了，这个时候我们是不是可以更早一点。
The pathogen was so fast that it was identified a week ago, but I mean there were a lot of alarms, so we could have done it a little earlier.
所以我们科室这么多年来，我们做的其实就是这一件事情，我们时刻对新发展的传染病保持极其高的警觉。
So for so many years in our department, what we have done is in fact this one thing, and we are always on the alert for new infectious diseases.
前些年上海发现H7N9病毒，我们科室第一时间发现并测序上报，我们认为这个体系是极为重要的一个，你这个医院必须具备强大的识别疾病的能力，我们才会安全，而不是把希望寄托在整个社会已经出现大流行了，我们国家队再入驻，再进行病毒细菌的鉴定，再出防控的政策。
The H7N9 virus was first discovered and sequenced by our department in Shanghai a few years ago. We think this system is very important. You have to have a strong ability to identify diseases so that we can be safe.
中国这一次其实做的挺快的，但是病毒实在太快了，你得跑在它的前面。
China is actually doing pretty fast this time around, but the virus is so fast that you have to run ahead of it.
怎么才能跑在它的前面，我个人觉得中国要有千千万万个像我们华山感染科这样的感染科。
How to run in front of it, I personally feel that China should have thousands of infected families like our Huashan Infection Department.
所以我呼吁国家要投入我们这种传染科的科室，将来要培育一批“常驻部队”，要养一批这样的人，而且要非常厉害，那要多厉害呢？就要像我们科这样厉害可以了，当然我在电视里面经常会吹牛，但是这也是呼吁，实际上就是要有一批中国的基层医院的感染科要非常强大，我觉得我们的民族才是安全的。
So I appeal to the state to invest in our infective departments, to cultivate "resident troops" in the future, to support a group of such people, and how fierce it is?
