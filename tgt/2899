不好意思，突然接到抓捕任务，才回来。
I'm sorry, I just came back on an arrest warrant.

South Window.
南风窗。
South Window.
冷静的力量。
The power of coolness.
原本约好的采访时间，民警高达爽约了。
Originally scheduled for the interview time, the police high up to the appointment.
四个半小时后，他才回复我：“不好意思，突然接到抓捕任务，才回来。
Four and a half hours later, he replied, "I'm sorry, I just came back on an arrest warrant.
”高达要抓捕的是他所在辖区内一名因斗殴致人轻伤的“潜逃”青年。
Gao wanted to arrest a "runaway" youth in his jurisdiction who had been slightly injured in the fight.
辖区地处云贵边境的山村，处理年轻人打架斗殴案件并不鲜见，但因为尚在疫情防控期间，派出所不能拘留，只能办理取保候审，规定青年在辖区指定范围活动。
The district is located in the mountain village of Yun Gui border, and it is not uncommon to deal with cases of assault among young people, but since police stations cannot detain them while the epidemic is under control, they can only be released on bail, requiring young people to operate in designated areas within their jurisdiction.
事情因此变得棘手。
So things get tricky.
被“取保候审”的年轻人不识字，更不懂这条法律意味着什么，被“放”回家后，他以为“没事了”，当晚就买了车票，准备次日照常前往广东打工。
Unable to read, let alone understand, what the law meant, the young man, who had been "released" from prison, thought he was "free" and that night bought a ticket for the next day's work in Guangdong Province.
接到通报的高达和同事们不得不再次出警处理。
Up to a reported high and colleagues had to be out of the police again.
一边是山村社会流动停滞下的蒙昧，一边是防疫工作的辛苦细碎，疫情之下，基层民警面对的情况变得愈发复杂。
On the one hand is the mountain village social mobility stagnant obscurantism, on the one hand, epidemic prevention work under the painstaking detail, under the epidemic situation, grass-roots civilian police face increasingly complex situation.
疫情困兽今年的春节，是高达从警多年来处理打架斗殴案件最多的一段日子。
This year's Spring Festival is the longest period in which police have dealt with cases of assault and battery.
疫情的到来，伴随着山村“打群架”数量的猛涨，是高达未曾料想的疫情“次生灾害”。
The arrival of the epidemic, along with the mountain village "fight group" number of soaring, is as high as the unexpected outbreak of "secondary disasters."
高达所在的辖区位于云南和贵州交界的山区，移动网络不通畅。
High up in the area of Yunnan and Guizhou at the junction of the mountainous area, mobile network is not smooth.
恰逢过年，外出打工的年轻人回来，正常情况下仅有的娱乐便也只有吃烧烤、喝酒、去网吧、打麻将、走亲戚。
On New Year's Eve, when young people come back, the only entertainment they normally have is barbecue, drinking, going to Internet cafes, playing Mahjong and visiting relatives.
由于疫情的影响，烧烤摊、网吧等实体商业全部关闭，打麻将、走亲戚等聚集活动一律取消，年轻人窝在家里无所事事。
As a result of the epidemic, barbecue stands, Internet cafes and other physical business closed, playing Mahjong, relatives and other gatherings were cancelled, young people nest at home idleness.
年后，广东、江浙一带的各大中小企业都延迟开工，打工者的假期无限延长。
In 2007, Guangdong, Jiangsu and Zhejiang all large and medium-sized enterprises delayed the start of work, workers' holidays unlimited extension.
陈年旧事、各式纠纷在日复一日的枯坐中摩擦滋生。
Friction breeds in the day-to-day sitting of the past and disputes of all kinds.
更重要的是，没钱了。
More importantly, there is no money.
“据我所知，很多人买了年货、过完年，现在身上所有的钱也仅仅只够一张车票了。
"As far as I know, a lot of people buy New Year's Eve, and now they only have enough money for a single ticket.
”发愁生计、复工遥遥无期，焦虑的情绪在封闭的“隔离”环境里更是冲突的导火索。
Worry about livelihoods, the prospect of returning to work, and anxiety is the trigger for conflict in a closed "quarantined" environment.
“战争”四起，像高达这样的基层警察便只能在反复的劝解、鉴伤、抓捕中疲于奔命。
"War" everywhere, such as up to the grass-roots police can only be repeated in the persuasion, injury, arrest in the struggle.
同样陷入救助困境的还有山村内的精神病患者。
Also in distress are people with mental illness in mountain villages.
正常情况下，他们如果能按时服药，多出门走走缓解情绪，就能减少发病的概率。
Under normal circumstances, if they can take medicine on time, more walk out to ease the mood, can reduce the incidence of the disease.
但在“不能出门”的防控要求下，隔离的精神病人情绪不稳，高达所在辖区内的很多精神病人都发病了。
However, under the "can't go out" control requirements, isolated mental patients are unstable, up to a lot of mental patients in their jurisdiction have the disease.
七天前的一个晚上，高达接到报警，有一名精神病患者拿着菜刀乱砍，砸坏家中财物、砍伤家人。
One night seven days ago, Gao received a police report that a mentally ill person with a kitchen knife had chopped down household property and hacked his family.
如果是平日，高达接警后会联系辖区内精神病医院的救护车等在一旁，待民警制服患者后，直接交给医院处理。
If it is a weekday, after receiving the police will contact the district psychiatric hospital ambulance waiting for the police to subdue the patient, directly to the hospital for treatment.
但最近，由于疫情的影响，救护车全部被抽调到防疫一线。
Recently, however, all ambulances were evacuated to the frontline due to the epidemic.
没有了医疗手段的现场辅助，高达和同事只能用束缚带等工具将精神病患者捆起来，再随患者家属一起将癫狂的病人送到医院。
Without on-site medical help, up to and from colleagues can only use straps and other tools to tie up the mentally ill, and then with the patient's family to send the insane patients to hospital.
2月27日，孝感市孝南区杨店镇解放社区一处疫情防控点，工作人员检查来往车辆的通行证比起人数众多、场面激烈的打架斗殴，高达更怕的还是有关精神病患者的出警。
Feb. 27, Xiaoyan City Xiaoan District Yangdian Town liberation community of an epidemic prevention and control point, staff check vehicles to and from the traffic than a large number of fierce scenes of fighting, more fear is about the mental illness of the police.
也是这个晚上，发病的患者拿刀砍向了高达——无意识的病人使那一刀的力量几乎毫无保留，是高达手里的盾牌救了他，幸运地在巧妙的角度把迎面而来的菜刀挡飞。
It was also that night that the sick man took a knife and chopped it up - the unconscious patient made the force of the knife almost unreservedly, and it was the shield in his hand that saved him, lucky enough to fend off the oncoming kitchen knife in a clever angle.
“最近精神病患者发病太多了，基本上每个星期都有一两个吧。
"There's been a lot of mental illness these days, basically one or two a week.
”下一次失控的菜刀飞过来的时候，还能不能这么幸运？高达没时间去想。
The next time a runaway kitchen knife flew by, could it be so lucky? It didn't take much time to think.
防护难题因为经常上网、热衷刷知乎，“武汉不明原因肺炎”第一次出现在高达的视野中，是2019年12月29日前后。
The first time "Wuhan Unexplained Pneumonia" appeared in the high field of vision was around December 29, 2019 because of frequent Internet use and a keen interest in brushing knowledge.
虽然觉得是“在湖北”，是“普通的、流感那样的病”，但高达还是在拼多多上下单了N95口罩：23.5元，买50个送10个。
Although "in Hubei," it is "common, flu-like illness," but still up and down in the more up-and-down order of N95 masks: 23.5 yuan, buy 50 to send 10.
到了2020年1月中旬，一切突然变得紧张起来。
By mid-January 2020, everything was suddenly tense.
“感觉就是一夜之间，所有的口罩都买不到了。
"The feeling is that all the masks can't be bought overnight.
”高达在拼多多上提早下单的这60个口罩，成了他和同事们的盾牌，是整个派出所当时唯一的防护装备。
The 60 masks, ordered earlier at the shopping mall, served as shields for him and his colleagues and were the only protective gear available to the station at the time.
也是从那时起，民警开始和社区一样成为基层防控中直接面对疫情的第一道防线。
Since then, the police and the community began to become the grass-roots prevention and control directly facing the first line of defense.
妥善处理基数庞大的疑似病例群体，医护人员及医疗资源是远远不够的。
It is not enough to deal with the large population of suspected cases with medical personnel and resources.
密切接触者、疑似病例、甚至一些确诊病例的转移，大多数都是由基层警察来执行。
Most transfers of close contacts, suspected cases and even confirmed cases are carried out by the police at the grass-roots level.
2月29日，海口市书场村，网格员潘之让（右二）与志愿服务队队员带着代买的物资，前往居家隔离人员住所疫情防控职责下沉，基层民警的职责范围扩大了、迎面而来的“刀子”更多了，“盾牌”却没能跟上。
Feb. 29, Haikou City Book Fair Village, grid worker Pan ZhiJean (second from the right) and members of the volunteer service team brought supplies to the home to control the epidemic, the responsibilities of the grass-roots civilian police expanded, more "knives" came in, but the Shield failed to keep up.
防疫初期，高达和同事们小心维护手中唯有的两三个口罩，用酒精消毒、反复使用——即使后来这种重复利用被专家澄清为无效防护；护目镜当然是没有的，民警们用的都是形态各异的泳镜，能防一分是一分；防护服，即使是运送高度疑似人员的时候也没有见过，高达就穿自己的警服雨衣，运送任务结束，在超市买一瓶50多度的“老白干”泡着消毒，因为酒精等消毒用品也没有。
At the beginning of the epidemic prevention campaign, Gao and his colleagues carefully maintained the only two or three face masks in their hands, disinfecting them with alcohol and repeatedly using alcohol - even though such reuse was later clarified by experts as ineffective; they certainly did not have them.
“衣服上一直都有股酒味！”高达笑言。
"There has always been a smell of wine on the clothes!" Up to laugh.
穿着“老白干”味道的警服雨衣，高达最危险的一次是20天前运送本地一确诊病例的密切接触者——他们和确诊病例曾一起同桌吃饭，属于“高度疑似”。
Wearing a "white dry" police raincoat, the most dangerous was a close contact 20 days ago who transported a local confirmed case - who had dined with a confirmed case and were "highly suspicious."
去的时候，只有警服、普通口罩和手套。
To go, only police uniforms, ordinary masks and gloves.
狭小的警车空间，驾驶室有简单的防护，疑似患者坐在后排“隔离区”。
Small police car space, the cab has a simple protection, suspected patients sitting in the back of the "isolation zone."
本来高达要和疑似患者同坐后排，和他同去的领导说因为高达孩子还很小，一旦隔离起来要很久都见不到面，还是他来代替高达去后排。
Gao was supposed to sit in the back row with the suspect, and the leader who went with him said that since the child was too young to be seen in isolation, he would take the place of up to the back row.
武汉市公安局江岸区分局百步亭派出所民警沈胜文（左）和战友一起将汽车加装隔离板，变成运送病患的专车没有防护的领导幸运地没有被感染，经过20多天的隔离后重回工作岗位；一样没有防护的民警奔波在基层防疫工作里，没被隔离，却也难见到幼小的孩子一面。
Shen Shengwen (left), a police officer at the Bumbuting police station of the Wuhan Public Security Bureau, together with his comrades, turned the car into a special vehicle for transporting sick people.
高达的孩子只有1岁10个月大，还是会在和爸爸的视频里絮絮不停说今天吃了什么玩了什么，挂断视频就会哇哇大哭的年纪。
Up to 1 year old and 10 months old, or in the video with my dad fuddle about what to eat today, hang up video will cry loudly age.
“到家门口了，我也就只能这么看一眼了。
"That's all I can look at when I get to my door.
”采访过程中，高达发来一张照片给我，透过被雨水模糊的车窗，能够看到一个普通小区的两栋楼房，和它们之间为了防疫临时设置的封堵屏障。
During the interview, Gaouda sent me a picture of two buildings in an ordinary neighborhood through rain-blurred windows and a temporary barricade between them for preventive purposes.
从大年初二到今天，因为疫情防控工作的展开，高达要处理打架斗殴、要护送精神病人、要运送疑似病例，还要在见缝插针地到社区设卡的路口辅助检测、维持治安。
From the second day of the Lunar New Year to the present, because of the spread of the disease prevention and control work, high to deal with fighting, to escort mental patients, to transport suspected cases, but also in the community to set up checkpoints at the junction, maintenance of law and order.
加上年前的忙碌，他已经两个月没有回过家、见到孩子了。
Coupled with his busy schedule of two years ago, he had not returned home and seen his children in two months.
这是他第一次短暂地休息，也是第一次“回家”——在屏障的缝隙间，远远地望一眼。
It was his first brief rest and his first "home" -- a glance from afar between the cracks in the barrier.
情理之间这些屏障、关卡，一度也造成了基层民警与辖区百姓之间的藩篱。
Reasonable between these barriers, checkpoints, at one time also caused the grass-roots civilian police and the area between the fence.
“山村里百姓受教育程度、甚至是识字的程度都达不到普遍的要求”，高达说，这些为防疫设置的检查站常常“处境危险”，有时因为百姓特别不配合，连简单的测体温、登记都没办法平静地做完。
"The level of education and even literacy of the people in the mountain villages does not meet the universal requirements." These checkpoints are often "in danger," it is claimed, sometimes because people are so uncooperative that even simple temperature tests and check-ups cannot be carried out peacefully.
一些年轻人甚至会直接开车冲撞检查站，把防护杆撞断。
Some young people even head for the checkpoint and break the stick.
“所以我们必须派一个民警去现场，协助医护人员和社区工作人员的防疫工作”，遇到那些仅因为生活中一点点的不便利而破坏防疫秩序的人，协助工作的民警可以当场带回，从严从重处罚。
"So we have to send a civilian police officer to the scene to help the health care workers and community workers to prevent the epidemic," said Wang. "Those who disrupt epidemic prevention simply because of a bit of inconvenience in life can be brought back to the police on the spot and given heavier punishments.
但也正是在这样的特殊情况下，高达觉得“执法”还是不能等同于“死板地执行法规”，更不能“跟大城市一个要求”。
But it is also in such special circumstances that Gauda feels that "law enforcement" cannot be equated with "rigid enforcement of the law," let alone "with the big city."
更多时候，在尽力完成文件下达的防控任务过程中，高达和同事们还要尽量考虑当地的人情世故与风俗。
Most of the time, in trying to complete the document issued in the control task, up to and colleagues also try to take into account the local customs and traditions.
疫情防控，明令所有人进出公共场所必须要戴口罩。
Prevention and control of the disease, all people must wear masks to access public places.
但在一线基层民警都没有渠道获得口罩的县城里，农村七八十岁的留守老人根本买不到口罩。
But in the first line of grass-roots police have no access to masks in the county, the countryside 78 or 10-year-old people left behind can not buy masks.
他们想到银行取现金维持生活，但买不到口罩，银行拒绝老人进入，他们只能无助地坐在地上哭泣。
They want to cash out of the bank, but can not buy masks, the bank refused to allow the elderly to enter, they can only sit helpless on the ground crying.
直到现在，本地也依然买不到合格的医用口罩，只能通过高价的代购。
Until now, the local still can not buy qualified medical masks, can only be purchased through high-priced surrogate.
很多老人为了能够出门办事，戴的是几乎没有防护效果的棉布口罩——是自己用布缝制的。
Many elderly people wear virtually no protective cotton masks - sewn with their own cloth - in order to be able to go out on business.
“他们问要到什么地方才能够买到口罩，我们确实没办法来回答他们这个问题，特别头疼。
"They asked where they were going to get masks, and we really couldn't answer them," he said.
”每次接到这样的警，除了从自己仅有的几个一次性口罩里“抠”出一个新的送给老人之外，高达也想不出更好的办法，“有的时候，就……挺心酸的吧。
"Every time they get the call, it's hard to think of anything better than picking out a new pair from one of the few disposable masks they have left.
”村里有的老人恰在疫情防控封村期间去世，有子女从外地赶回来，因为防疫隔离要求，不被允许进入村子见老人最后一面。
Some of the village's elderly died while the epidemic was under control, and children were rushed back from outside the village because they were not allowed to enter the village to see the old man for the last time because of quarantine requirements.
“有的不停哭啊闹啊这些，打我们，骂一些很难听的话。
"Some people keep crying and making noise, beating us, scolding some very bad words.
本来按相关的治安管理处罚法，我们是可以对他们进行处罚的。
We could have punished them according to the relevant law on public security administration.
”“但是真的”，高达叹了口气，“法不外乎人情，像这样的情况，我们全都忍了。
'But really, 'sighed the man,' the law is nothing but human, and in such cases as this we bear it all.
”除了冲突与繁杂之外，还是有那么一些“高光时刻”，让高达为自己的职业感到由衷的自豪。
In addition to conflict and complexity, there are moments of high light, when a person feels genuinely proud of his or her career.
疫情期间，一位居家隔离的矿工喝多了酒，把隔壁邻居家瓦房的房梁锯断了，醉醺醺地闹事。
During the outbreak, a quarantined miner drank too much wine, sawed off the beams of the next-door-neighbor's house and rioted drunkenly.
矿工身材魁梧，有一米八五高，高达只有一米七三，和另一位同事一起合力将这位“魁梧大汉”制服。
The giant miner, a meter eight-five tall and as tall as one meter seven-three, joined forces with another colleague to subdue the burly man.
抓捕很顺利，闻声观望的百姓很多，有小朋友叫着“警察真厉害！”在欢呼声里，高达觉得自己像孩子一样地欣喜起来。
The capture was smooth, and there were a lot of people watching, with children shouting, "The police are fierce!" In cheering, Gauda felt as happy as a child.
更感动的一次是高达和三名同事去村子里督查归来。
Even more touching was the return from a visit to the village with three colleagues.
因为辖区比较大，从派出所到最远的农村，开车往返要三个小时，回来以后，饭店、单位食堂都已经关门了。
Because the area is relatively large, from the police station to the farthest countryside, it takes three hours to drive back and forth, after the return of the hotel, unit canteen has been closed.
他们找到一家小吃摊，敲开门，试探着问能不能煮点东西给他们吃。
They went to a snack bar and knocked on the door to see if they could cook something for them.
“老板现准备的材料，给我们煮了面条，走的时候怎么都不要我们的钱，扫码也不让扫，就说我们辛苦了，辛苦了。
"The boss is now prepared materials, for us boiled noodles, how to go when we do not want our money, sweep the code also not to sweep, said we have worked hard, hard.
”我问他“疫情防控工作结束后最想做的是什么？”没有得到回音。
I asked him, "What do you want to do after the epidemic is over?" There was no response.
采访再一次中断。
The interview was interrupted again.
直到次日中午，高达才充满歉意地回复我说，他本来在回去休息的路上跟我聊天，结果被临时叫走到昆明支援，保障农民工复工车队的安全，手机电量跟他一样“毫无准备”，自动关机了。
It was only at noon the next day that Gao replied apologetically that he had been talking to me on his way back to rest, only to be temporarily called to Kunming for support to ensure the safety of migrant workers returning to work.
他忙碌了一夜，直到此时才刚刚休息，找到给手机充电的地方，回答我的问题。
He was busy all night, until then just rest, find a place to charge the mobile phone, answer my questions.
按照前一天他在采访中流露的思念，我以为他一定会回答说“想要回家见孩子”。
I thought he would reply, "I want to go home and see my child," according to the thoughts he expressed in an interview the day before.
但在两个月的持续疲惫里、在休息日再次被“剥夺“之后，他回答说“说真心话，我只想回家好好睡两天。
But after two months of constant exhaustion, and being "deprived" again on his day off, he replied, "To tell you the truth, I just want to go home and have a good night's sleep.
