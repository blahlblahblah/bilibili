她住在汉口，原本是个极宅的半退休妇女。
She lived in Hankow, a semi-retired woman who used to live in an extreme house.
当别人都闭门不出的时候，她反倒打了鸡血一样天天往外跑。
When everyone else was shut up, she ran out every day like chicken blood.
她不忍那些“留守宠物”因主人无法回城而饿死、病死，就瞒着家人开车去帮忙喂食和清洁。
She could not bear to leave their "pets" because their owners could not return to the city and died of starvation and disease, so she drove to help feed and clean without their families.
“没人管的话，那些视猫狗为亲人的主人也会焦虑、悲伤、甚至想尽办法溜回来，这样岂不是会带来更大的隐患。
"People who see cats and dogs as the owners of their loved ones become anxious, sad and even try to sneak back," he said.
我们帮助猫狗也是帮助人。
We also help people by helping cats and dogs.
”世界卫生组织称，目前没有证据显示狗猫等宠物会感染新型冠状病毒。
The World Health Organisation said there was no evidence that pets such as dogs and cats were infected with the new coronavirus.
她希望疫情褪去后，武汉每只留守的毛孩子都能活蹦乱跳地迎接他们的主人。
She hoped that after the epidemic subsided, Wuhan after each of the children left behind to meet their master alive.
以下是的述2月4日，一名市民在武汉长江大桥附近骑车。
On February 4, a citizen rode a bicycle near the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge.
新华社 图偷溜帮忙喂养的决定是在为期一天的“溜走实验”之后——我找了去超市、拿快递、去老家浇花等各种理由频繁出门，发现家人没有起疑。
The decision to sneak in to help feed was made after a one-day "slip-off experiment" - I went out to the supermarket, got express delivery, went to my hometown to water the flowers, and found no doubt about my family.
8年前，我孩子去国外上学。
Eight years ago, my child went to school abroad.
丈夫忙，半退休状态的我白天基本都是一个人在家。
My husband is busy and I'm semi-retired. I'm basically alone during the day.
上午守着QQ等着跟有时差的孩子聊天，下午睡觉，心里蛮空虚的。
Watching QQ in the morning, waiting to chat with the children with time difference, sleeping in the afternoon, is quite empty.
这时候，我养了第一只狗，皮皮（化名）。
By this time, I had my first dog, Pippi (alias).
算是踏上了一条不归路吧。
I'm on my way home.
我把皮皮当孩子，一把屎一把尿把它带大，狗粮要细细挑选，时不时去看看它的水盆，经常问“饿了吗？渴了吗”。
I take Pippi as a child, a piece of excrement to take it up, dog food to be carefully selected, from time to time to see its basin, often asked "hungry? thirsty?"
为了它的健康成长，我还会带它去我家附近的草坪玩耍。
For its healthy growth, I would also take it to play on the lawn near my home.
我看过一部电影，《忠犬八公的故事》，一只狗在主人死后每天都去车站等候主人归来。
I saw a movie, The Story of a Dog, in which a dog goes to the station every day after his master dies and waits for his master to return.
慢慢地，我被狗的忠诚和纯真打动了，不是电影里的那只，也不是我家里的这只，是这个物种。
Slowly, I was moved by the loyalty and innocence of the dog, not the one in the movie, not the one in my family, it was the species.
说来也巧，7年前的一天，我本来只想捐些狗粮给武汉市小动物保护协会。
As it happens, one day seven years ago, I just wanted to donate some dog food to the Wuhan Small Animals Protection Association.
可是在开车过去的路上，我看见快车道上有条黑色泰迪在走，似乎眼睛有问题。
But as I drove past, I saw a black Teddy walking down the fast lane, as if he had eyes problems.
我怕我开走后，来个车它就没命了，打开双闪灯停在快车道上把它抱进车里，救助了它。
I was afraid that when I drove away, he would die in a car, turn on the double-flash and pull it into the car to save it.
之后，它被一个女孩子领养了。
Then it was adopted by a girl.
再后来，我成为了一名志愿者，救助的动物越来越多，也越来越不忍心看着小动物受苦。
Later, I became a volunteer, rescuing more and more animals, but also more and more unwilling to see small animals suffer.
这次疫情来得太突然了。
The outbreak came too suddenly.
本来大家没想着人传人，还在高高兴兴办年货、走亲戚、吃年饭呢，嗨得不行。
Originally, we did not think of human-to-human, but also happy to do New Year's goods, relatives, eat New Year's dinner, hey do not.
“封城”一声令下，整座城一下子就“冻”住了一样，特别安静。
"Seal the city" under a command, the whole city immediately "frozen" live the same, particularly quiet.
疫情是无情的，我每天看新闻，隔离数、确诊数往上走，像是战时。
The outbreak is ruthless, I read the news every day, isolation, diagnosis of the number of upward, like wartime.
可人在“打仗”的时候，小动物就必须得沦为炮灰了吗？那些因为主人离汉无法归来的“留守宠物”怎么办？我觉得这些没有自救能力的宠物挺可怜的。
When people "fight," must small animals become cannon fodder? What about "pets left behind" because their owners are unable to return home? I think these pets are pitiful.
它们是伴侣动物，给人带来欢乐、驱散人的寂寞。
They are companion animals that bring joy and dissipate loneliness.
封城之后，不能由着它们饿死、病死吧。
After the closure of the city, they can not starve to death.
再说，没人管的话，那些视猫狗为亲人的主人也会焦虑、悲伤、甚至想尽办法溜回来，这样岂不是会带来更大的隐患。
What's more, if no one cares, the owners of cats and dogs will be anxious, sad and even try to sneak back.
我们帮助猫狗也是帮助人。
We also help people by helping cats and dogs.
说实话，从本能上讲我还是会担心自己。
To tell you the truth, I still worry about myself instinctively.
毕竟汉口被很多人视作感染风险“高危地”。
After all, Hankou is considered by many to be at "high risk" of infection.
家人也很重视，跟我叨叨疫情严重，不让我出门。
My family also took me seriously and told me that the epidemic was so serious that I was not allowed out.
我想，做好防护措施，我开车去一个不住人的房里喂完动物，再一个人开车回来，一路也不跟人接触，应该没事。
I thought, do the protective measures, I drive to a non-living room to feed animals, and then a person driving back, all the way no contact, should be all right.
1月27日，我给武汉市小动物保护协会的负责人发微信，接下了疫情期间汉口某个区域入户喂养的活。
On January 27, I sent a letter to the head of the Wuhan Small Animals Protection Association, who took over the work of feeding a house in Hankou during the outbreak.
“我们现在忙都忙不过来。
"We're all too busy right now.
”他语音回复我。
He gave me a speech.
“我等你的安排。
"I will wait for your arrangements.
”跟他聊天时，如果老公在身边，手机一亮我就离他远点再打开。
"If my husband was around and the phone was on, I would leave him alone and open it.
宠物主人一般是在协会发的微信文章后留言或者加群联系的。
Pet owners are generally in the association after the micro-mail article message or add group contact.
他们会写明宠物类型、大概几号断粮、地址等等。
They will specify the type of pet, approximate number of rations, address, etc.
我们根据缓急来确定上门时间，并提前打电话确认对方没有其他邻居或亲友可以求助。
We set the visiting hours according to our priorities and call ahead to make sure the other party has no other neighbors or friends to turn to.
如果需要撬锁，我也要提前联系好开锁师傅，两人约定在小区门口见面。
If you need to pry the lock, I also want to contact the lock master in advance, the two agreed to meet in front of the community.
没封城之前，我凭着身份证去药店买了三十个医用口罩。
Before I closed the city, I went to the pharmacy with my ID card and bought 30 medical masks.
因为经常去基地帮着清理狗舍猫舍，我过年前囤了些一次性袖套和手套，恰好能派上用场。
Because often go to the base to help clean up the doghouse cat house, I hoard some disposable cuffs and gloves, just come in handy.
酒精是朋友送的。
Alcohol comes from friends.
现在特殊时期，我和我老公一人一间房。
Now in special times, my husband and I share a room.
我家两只狗，也是他带一只我带一只。
My two dogs, he also took a I brought one.
吃完饭，我老公回房，我偷偷拿上车钥匙和防护用品就出门了。
After dinner, my husband returned to the room, I secretly pick up the keys to the car and protective equipment and went out.
有天我出门帮喂，开着车呢，我孩子邀请我视频通话。
One day I went out to help Hey, drive, my kid invited me on a video call.
孩子一看到我就喊了起来，“跟你说了不能出门！” 我说开着车呢，没事，撒谎去顺丰拿快递，因为现在都是自提，不送上门了。
The child saw me cried out, "I told you not to go out!" I said to drive, nothing, lying to Shunfeng to get express, because now it is self-mentioned, do not send the door.
虽然有时候会因为撒谎感到愧疚，但想想是为了小动物的性命，也算是个善意的谎言吧。
Sometimes I feel guilty about lying, but it's a white lie to think it's for the lives of small animals.
车少了，路都变宽了一样。
With fewer cars, the roads have widened.
开车倒是蛮爽，以往40分钟走走停停的路我现在20分钟不到就能开到。
It's pretty cool driving. The last 40 minutes of a stop-and-go drive I can drive in less than 20 minutes.
到了宠物所在的小区门口，保安盘问，我就说人家要求我们帮忙上门喂猫的。
When I got to the front of the pet's neighborhood, the security guard asked, and I said we were asked to help feed the cat.
目前为止，还没有保安为难我。
So far, no security guard has bothered me.
2月9日，武汉市某社区实施封闭管理。
February 9, Wuhan City, a community to implement a closed management.
新华社 图上门到现在，我通过协会帮喂过6只猫、1只狗。
Xinhua News Agency graph door to the present, I helped feed through the association 6 cats, 1 dog.
最远那家在北湖的一个老小区，养了两只猫。
The farthest house in an old neighborhood in the North Lake has two cats.
我和撬锁师傅从1楼爬到8楼，两个人喘了半天。
The locksmith and I climbed from the first floor to the eighth floor, and the two of us gasped for a long time.
开锁全程跟女主人视频的，师傅边在那弄，她说家里有个大的猫砂盆，应该不会很乱。
Unlock the whole process with the hostess video, master side in there, she said that there is a big cat sand basin, should not be very messy.
门一开，一塌糊涂。
The door opened in a muddle.
她家两个卧室都开着，本来是想让猫玩的地方能大一点，结果一张床是猫屎，一张床是猫尿。
Her two bedrooms were open, originally intended to let the cat play a little bigger place, resulting in a bed is cat excrement, a bed is cat urine.
“怎么会这样？”她看着视频通话里的画面吓呆了。
"How could that be?" She was petrified by the images in the video call.
我进去一看，猫砂盆里装的是膨润土猫砂，盆子倒是挺深的，但面积太小了。
I went in and saw that the litter basin was filled with bentonite cat sand. It was deep, but it was too small.
膨润土又重，猫扒拉不动，没法把屎埋起来。
The bentonite was heavy, and the cat did not move and could not bury the excrement.
几天就拉满了猫砂盆，就往床上祸害了。
A few days later, the litter pan filled the cat, and then went to bed scourge.
主人气得要死。
The master was dying with anger.
我说这不是猫的原因，是人的原因。
I said it was not the cat, it was the human cause.
你没回来，也没准备充足。
You didn't come back. You weren't ready.
我从餐桌下找到只橘猫、窗台上找到只白色长毛猫。
I found an orange cat under the table and a long white cat on the windowsill.
万幸，它们都活着。
Luckily, they're alive.
其实帮助小动物的很大一部分是处理屎尿，这个可以说吗？听起来挺污糟，但这就是上门喂猫的工作之一，也是人养宠必须要承担的……这两只猫单独在家有十天了，一张床上有几十泡屎。
In fact, a large part of helping small animals is excrement disposal. This may sound like dirt, but this is one of the jobs of home-feeding cats, and it's a human favor... these two cats have been at home alone for ten days and have dozens of poop in one bed.
隔着口罩我都能问到刺鼻的臭味。
Through the mask I can always ask about the pungent odor.
然后，我戴着手套拿他们家的餐巾纸抓床上的屎。
Then I wore gloves to grab the shit off their napkin bed.
干巴巴的、黏糊糊的，通通都放进我随身带着的塑料袋里。
It was dry and sticky, all put into the plastic bag I had with me.
那主人舍不得扔床单，我还要把床单理出来扔在门外。
The master hated to throw the sheets, and I had to cut them out and throw them out the door.
我都不嫌弃这些屎尿，我原来在协会的基地见识过更脏的呢。
I don't hate this shit. I've seen even dirtier shit in the institute's base.
每周一次去做义工，那都是一身屎、一身尿回来。
Volunteer once a week. It's all shit and urine.
那些小狗看到人来开心嘛，不停地扒拉着想要抱，尽管它们脚上踩了屎尿，但看着它们水汪汪的眼睛，你是很难拒绝的。
Those puppies are happy to see people, and keep picking and trying to hug, even though they get dung beetle on their feet, but it's hard to refuse to look at their watery eyes.
等我从基地出来，一身固定的行头上全是猫狗蹭上的屎尿，只能脱下来在装在塑料袋里、把口子扎紧了才敢回家。
When I got out of the base, my head was covered with cat and dog dung, and I had to take it off in a plastic bag and fasten it tightly before I dared go home.
我家狗都嫌弃我。
My dog hates me.
我进门跟家人招呼都不打就冲进浴室，先洗衣服后洗澡。
I rushed into the bathroom without saying hello to my family. I washed my clothes and took a shower.
我去过一个满是呕吐物的房间，属于一套房隔成好几间合租房的那种。
I've been to a room full of vomit, the kind of apartment with several shared rooms.
一张床、一个写字台、一个衣柜，两个猫砂盆和猫粮就挨着衣柜放，这些东西就把七八平米的房间堆满了。
A bed, a desk, a wardrobe, two cat basins and cat food were next to the wardrobe, and they filled the room with seven or eight square meters.
第一次去的时候，那只猫咪等在门口，估计是以为主人回来了。
On the first visit, the cat was waiting at the door, expecting her master to return.
我一进去，它“噌”一下就钻到床底下，我只看到个影子。
As soon as I got in, he "miso" got under the bed, and I only saw a shadow.
它主人是个来武汉打工的男生，20多岁吧。
Its owner is a male student who comes to Wuhan to work, in his 20s.
他跟我讲，猫是朋友不要他才养着的，大概是他买的猫粮太便宜了，猫吃得少而且拉稀呕吐。
He told me that the cat was a friend who didn't want him, probably because the cat food he bought was too cheap, the cat ate less and vomited less.
我看着床上、地上，那种黄绿的东西一滩滩的，十天下来，干的干、湿的湿，也没法下脚，于是去公共厕所拿拖把、扫把，弄了将近一个小时。
I looked at the bed, the ground, the yellow and green stuff, the beach, ten days down, dry and wet, and unable to get off my feet, so I went to the public toilet for mop and broom for almost an hour.
边拖我就边跟他聊，夸他有爱心，就花心思各种表扬吧。
As I dragged me to chat with him, boast of his love, put all sorts of praise on the mind.
因为也怕他回来以后嫌麻烦就把猫丢了，或者对猫不好。
For fear of losing the cat when he returned, or of being unkind to the cat.
小伙子嘛，他听了（我的话）心里不就舒服一些，就不会把猫扔掉嘛。
Young man, he's not comfortable enough to throw away the cat.
他家猫粮、猫砂不够，朋友都在别的区，封路过不来。
His cat food, cat sand is not enough, friends are in other areas, sealed can not come.
我先在我小区附近的宠物店给他买了4包，又提前跟市区的一家猫舍联系好，专门开车过去买了三袋猫砂。
I first bought him four bags at a pet store near my neighborhood, then contacted a cat house downtown in advance and drove over to buy three bags of cat litter.
35元一袋的猫砂，那不便宜，平时网上买也就20左右。
35 yuan a bag of cat sand, that is not cheap, usually buy online about 20.
可现在武汉全城的猫粮、猫砂都告急了，也没人会嫌贵。
But now the whole city of Wuhan cat food, cat sand are urgent, no one is too expensive.
我第二次去他家的时候，那只三四个月大的小猫跟我很亲，摸我的手，扑我的脚，到处蹭。
The second time I went to his house, the three or four-month-old kitten was very close to me, touched my hand, put his feet on me and rubbed against me everywhere.
当时就觉得，我是个好人。
At the time, I felt like a good man.
我还遇见过一个打工男孩，他的猫被关在猫笼里。
I also met a working boy whose cat was kept in a cage.
养猫的人叫那“猫咪别墅”，猫粮、猫砂盆都在里面。
Cat owners called the "cat villa", cat food, cat litter basin are inside.
我去的时候盆里有水，但没猫粮了。
There was water in the basin when I went, but there was no cat food.
那只看上去已经成年的猫看到我扫都不扫一眼，也不叫唤，好像不怎么开心，比较冷漠。
The adult-looking cat did not even glance at me and did not bark, as if she were unhappy and apathetic.
我也只敢隔着笼子摸摸它。
I only dared to touch him across the cage.
我一般是喂完、收拾完就离开的，有只小狗是个例外。
I usually leave when I'm done, with the exception of a puppy.
那只黑白色的约克夏被关在铺着一次性尿垫的阳台上，身上一股尿骚味。
The black-and-white Yorkshire was locked up on a balcony with a disposable urine pad and smelled of urine.
看到我来，它兴奋得转圈。
He turned round and round when he saw me.
我把它从阳台放进来喝水，真的是牛饮，一下子就喝了半碗。
I put it in from the balcony to drink water, is really a drink, drink half a bowl at once.
它主人去西安玩，封城没办法回来，亲友也没人可以照看。
Its owner went to Xi'an to play, the city can not come back, relatives and friends can not look after.
我就说可以把这只小狗带去我家附近的宠物店。
I said I could take the puppy to the pet store near my house.
正好那家宠物店还寄养着我从协会带出来的两只残疾狗，我每天都回去照看它们。
The pet store had two disabled dogs that I brought out of the association, and I went back to look after them every day.
跟我回去后，那只小狗肚子那边的毛全被我剃了。
After coming back with me, I shaved all the hair off the side of the dog's tummy.
因为它毛长，尿尿的时候粘到了，时间久都打结了。
Because it has long hair, pee when the time glued, the time has been tied.
它脚上踩了屎，臭得不行，宠物店的热水器不能用，我也只能把它脚掌的毛剃光。
It's got shit on its feet, it stinks badly, the water heater doesn't work in the pet shop, and I have to shave off the hairs on the soles of his feet.
它主人也蛮在意这只狗的，后来从西安租了个车赶紧返汉了。
The owner also took good care of the dog, then rented a car from Xi'an and hurried back to Han.
前一天晚上到，第二天就来店里接狗。
Arrived the night before and came to pick up the dog the next day.
那天我在宠物店搞卫生，三只狗在店里撒欢。
The other day I was cleaning up at the pet store and three dogs were having fun.
主人一叫小狗的名字，哇，给它开心的哟，两只爪子不停挠玻璃门，就要出去。
The owner called the name of the dog, wow, give it happy yo, two claws constantly scratching the glass door, will go out.
那种再见主人的开心劲，让我觉得做这个事，值了。
The joy of seeing my master again made me feel that it was worth it.
它主人没进来，不知道是因为疫情还是因为狗太臭了（笑）。
Its owner didn't come in, I don't know if it was because of the outbreak or because the dog smelled so bad (laughs).
于是我们就隔着口罩、玻璃门喊话，我把狗装在航空箱里递给她，她发短信感谢我。
We yelled through the mask and the glass door, and I handed her the dog in an airbox. She sent me a text message thanking me.
限行2月3日中午，我接到了一条“限行”的短信，大意是提醒私家车主，对非参与民生保障工作、生活继续使用机动车之类的，一律不得上路行驶，否则会予以查处。
Restricted February 3 at noon, I received a "limited line" text message, to the effect that private car owners, non-participation in livelihood security work, continue to use motor vehicles, and so on, will not be allowed to drive on the road, otherwise will be investigated and punished.
那几天天气比较好，可能有些人蠢蠢欲动想出门，交通部门才再次提醒吧。
Those days the weather is better, some people may be tempted to go out, the traffic department just remind you again.
2月3日，武汉街头人迹寥寥。
On February 3, the streets of Wuhan were deserted.
新华社 图当天正好我下午有个帮喂的活。
Xinhua News Agency just happened to have a feeding job in the afternoon.
想了一会儿，我还是放心不下那只猫，冒着被交警扣12分的风险也要去。
After thinking about it for a while, I still couldn't worry about the cat and risked being detained by the traffic police for 12 points.
我说辞都想好了，要不说我没看到，要不说我这也算保障民生，毕竟动物尸体腐烂也会造成卫生问题吧。
I've got everything I can say, or I don't see it, or I'm trying to ensure people's livelihood. After all, decomposition of animal carcasses can cause health problems.
那只猫的主人是福建人，她家是在这边做建材生意的，把猫关在商铺里，说自己可能要10天后才能回来。
The owner of the cat is Fujian, her home is here to do building materials business, the cat in the shop, said that they may not return 10 days.
本来她是要把电动卷闸门和玻璃门的钥匙寄给我的，但快递到不了武汉，只能让邻居到家里拿了备用钥匙给我。
She would have sent me the keys to the electric sluice gate and the glass door, but the courier couldn't get to Wuhan, so she had to let her neighbor get the spare key for me.
下午三点我拿到钥匙，三点十分我就出了门。
I got the key at three in the afternoon and went out at ten past three.
正在开门的时候，女孩在视频里叫“毛毛”，猫就在里头喵喵叫。
While opening the door, the girl in the video called "Maomao," the cat on the inside meow meow.
女孩也特开心，很兴奋地喊“太好了，你还活着！”进去之后，里头黑黢黢的，见不着光。
The girl was also very happy and excitedly yelled, "Good, you're still alive!" After entering, the darkness was dark and he couldn't see the light.
那只七个月大的白色田园猫，脑门上有两条黑花纹，一看它就躲我。
The seven-month-old white garden cat, with two black markings on its forehead, hid from me.
水、粮还有猫砂盆还是准备得蛮充足的，我搞完卫生、添好猫粮和水，感觉这猫能支撑到主人回来。
There was plenty of water, grain, and a litter pan for the cat. I cleaned it up, added cat food and water, and felt that the cat would hold out until its owner came back.
后来我也没再接帮喂单子了。
And then I didn't take over the feed order.
我每天去一次小区附近的宠物店，把从基地带回来的两只残疾小狗牵出去遛。
I went to a pet store near my neighborhood once a day to take out two disabled puppies from the base.
也不能让它们在外面待的时间长了。
And you can't keep them out for long.
有些地方传言说动物会有传染病，捕杀猫狗，我还是很担心的。
There are rumors in some quarters that animals have infectious diseases and kill cats and dogs, and I am still worried.
宠物店外大概是十点半左右会有阳光，我一般就那时候带它们出去晒晒，遛二十多分钟再回去。
Pet shop outside about 10: 30 will be the sun, I usually take them out to bask in the sun, walking for more than 20 minutes before going back.
去宠物店的路上会路过一家店面，里头关着两只小狗，每天一见我就隔着玻璃门摇尾巴，身后是满地的屎尿。
On the way to the pet shop, I pass a store with two puppies inside. Every day, I wag my tail through the glass door and behind me there is a piss on the ground.
本来是有人去喂养它们的，但那人封城后就不愿意去了，隔了好多天去说受不了，房子里面太脏，回家身上过敏。
They had been fed, but the man was unwilling to go after the closure of the city, after many days to say that the house is too dirty, home allergy.
我能从缝里塞狗粮给它们吃，但弄不进去水。
I can stuff dog food into them, but I can't get in.
我纠结了几天，还是不忍心，辗转联系到人开了门，进去打扫了两小时。
After a few days of perplexity, I could not bear to contact the man who opened the door and went in to clean it for two hours.
唉，又是扫屎拖尿。
Oh, shit again. Piss.
我腰不好，弄得自己累得不行。
My waist is not good and I'm tired out.
回了家，我去洗澡前往我家空气净化器边上一站，数值直线上升到265。
Back home, I went to the shower to go to my house next to the air purifier station, the numeric value rose to 265.
我吓得赶紧走，幸好丈夫在边上没注意，不然看到又要说我。
I was scared to go, but luckily my husband did not pay attention to the side, otherwise I would have to say.
有时候在家里做家务、看电视，一下子会想起帮喂过的某只宠物的样子，就像一张照片一样。
Sometimes at home do housework, watching TV, will suddenly remember to help feed the appearance of a pet, like a photo.
比如被关在笼子那只冷漠的猫，它主人后来联系过我一次，但因为封路了，我也过不去，只得让他再联系协会的其他志愿者。
Like the cold cat in the cage whose owner contacted me once later, but since the road was blocked, I couldn't get through, so I had to ask him to contact the other volunteers at the association.
偶尔我就会想它之后会怎么样，会不会有应激反应。
Once in a while I wonder what will happen to it and whether there will be stress.
有的人会写日记之类的，我就是一笔糊涂账。
Some people will write a diary or something, I just a muddle-headed.
比如说我救助的狗，别人领养了，过得好，我心里会很舒服。
For example, I rescued the dog, others adopted, a good life, I will be very comfortable.
过得不好，我就会去想，是不是我不该把它送出去，会不会有另一种结果？我就开始纠结、烦恼。
When things go wrong, I wonder if I shouldn't have given it away, if it had had another result? I began to get tangled up and annoyed.
我怕积攒多了自己压抑，干脆就不去主动联系那些主人，默认小动物都在享福。
I am afraid of accumulating too much of their repression, simply do not contact those masters, default animals are enjoying good.
我现在家里除了“原住民”皮皮之外，还领养了只老年狗。
I now have an old dog in my family besides "Aborigine" Pippi.
一般这种狗体弱多病，没人领养，我也只是想给它养老送终。
Usually this dog is frail and infirm, no one has adopted it, and I just want to give it up for retirement.
我觉得我从狗身上学到了很多，以前我跟老公吵架，会觉得情绪一下子特别激动，愤怒或者难过。
I think I've learned a lot from dogs, and when I argued with my husband, I felt particularly excited, angry, or upset.
可见多了那些残疾狗，这些狗的生活条件那么差，仍然还对人保持善意，开开心心地吃饭、玩耍，我觉得人真的应该知足、平和些。
There are so many disabled dogs. These dogs live in such bad conditions that they still treat people in good faith and eat and play happily. I think people should be contented and peaceful.
其实我平时很宅的，反而别人都宅家里时，我却打了鸡血一样天天往外跑。
