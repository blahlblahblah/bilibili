深度和角度——这就是我们能做的。
Depth and angle - that's what we can do.

我觉得，我们是来这里治病的，这种临时搭建起来的地方，基本条件过得去就可以了。
I think we're here to treat the sick, this makeshift place, the basic conditions can be decent.
特殊时期，大家需要互相谅解。
In special times, people need to understand each other.
我也相信，疫情过去后，一切都会好起来的。
I also believe that everything will be all right when the epidemic is over.
口述 | 李　甜整理 | 应　琛我今年43岁，在武汉硚口区税务局工作。
At the age of 43, I work for the Wuhan Zhangkou District Tax Administration.
我原本是一个很阳光的单亲妈妈，准备今年2月2日结婚的。
I was a single, sunny mother, ready to get married on February 2 this year.
但因为这场无声的战斗，一下子变得一无所有。
But as a result of this silent battle, suddenly become nothing.
李甜说自己在疫情来之前一直是一个乐观开朗的单亲母亲家里最早是我妈妈在1月24日晚上出现了咳嗽的情况。
Li said she had been an upbeat single mother until the outbreak began with my mother coughing on the night of January 24.
到了1月25日，就有点加剧了，一直低烧在38.5度左右。
By January 25, it was a bit worse, with a low fever of about 38.5 degrees.
我爸爸在南京上班，年前就回家了。
My father worked in Nanjing and went home years ago.
因为提前请了假，1月20日，我也不上班了。
I stopped working on January 20th because I took leave early.
从这天后，全家人都在家，没有去过什么人群聚集的地方。
Since that day, the whole family had been at home, and had not been to any gathering place.
我爸是中医、主任医师，我妈是西医，我自己大专的时候也是学中医的。
My father is a Chinese medicine, chief physician, my mother is Western medicine, my own junior college is also a study of Chinese medicine.
所以我们当时都以为母亲只是普通的感冒发烧，在家自行给她输了液。
So we all thought the mother was just a common cold fever, at home to her own infusion.
她的烧确实也退了。
Her fever had really gone.
但之后的几天里，我家四个人陆续出现了不舒服的情况，不过都没有发烧。
Over the next few days, however, four members of my family became unwell, but none had a fever.
像我就是浑身痛，脖子也痛，我还以为是颈椎病犯了。
Like I was all over pain, neck pain, I thought it was a cervical spondylosis.
说真的，四个人三个是学医的，完全没有想过会感染，我们都很注意的。
Seriously, the three of us are medical students, and we don't think it's gonna infect at all. We all pay attention to it.
家人合影1月30日，我妈身体突然变差，说她难受。
My mother suddenly got sick and said that she was sick.
我一看情况确实不太妙。
I don't see much of a deal.
我赶紧跑到小区开着的那个门，问保安能不能把离我家近的那个门打开。
I ran to the open door of the neighborhood and asked the guard if he could open the door next to mine.
因为现在每个小区都封门，唯一开着的那个门，我搀着母亲走过去的话要十多分钟。
Because now each community is closed, the only open door, I helped my mother walk past the words take more than 10 minutes.
但他们说不行，那也没办法。
But they said no. There's no way out.
我又去跟社区报备，说我家里是这样的情况，问是不是他们派车把我妈送去指定医院，但他们让我自己送到指定的前进卫生院核查。
I went back to the community and told them what was happening in my family, and asked if they had sent a car to take my mother to a designated hospital, but they sent me myself to the designated forward health centre for verification.
那天，我自己的身体也还是痛，但家里只有我，还好当时还能开车，就把母亲送过去了。
That day, my own body is still painful, but only me at home, but fortunately can still drive, sent his mother.
对方只能做胸透，建议我要去大医院进一步做CT。
The other party can only do chest X-ray, I suggest I go to the big hospital for further CT.
离我们家最近的就是协和医院，但我知道那里肯定人满为患，我妈这个情况不可能排队的。
The closest thing to our house was Concorde Hospital, but I knew it was going to be crowded. My mom couldn't have lined up.
我又开着车把我妈送到了江岸区一个比较偏的医院，CT做完，医生说不排除是新冠肺炎。
I drove my mother to a more partial hospital in the Jiangxi area, CT done, the doctor said not to rule out the new crown pneumonia.
但他们这里不具备条件。
But they don't have conditions here.
我妈拉着我，说她喘不过气来。
My mother took me by the hand and said she could not breathe.
我赶紧把她送去了协和。
I rushed her to Concorde.
在发热门诊，我是直接跪在了地上，说快来人救救我妈妈，她快不行了。
In the fever clinic, I kneel directly on the ground, said that someone to help my mother, she is going to die.
幸好，有个像是护士长的人，马上找了轮椅把母亲送去吸氧，这才缓解了一点。
Fortunately, a man like the head nurse immediately found a wheelchair to send her mother to oxygen, which eased a bit.
当天我把所有能做的检查都给我妈做了，包括核酸检测。
That day I did everything I could for my mother, including a nucleic acid test.
我自己也做了核酸检测。
I did a nucleic acid test myself.
输液室里面太恐怖了，全是吸氧的人。
The infusion room is horrible. It's full of oxygen-sucking people.
那天我妈就一直坐在输液室门口，但非常冷。
My mother had been sitting in the infusion room that day, but it was very cold.
我就去找医生问能不能安排住院。
I went to see the doctor and asked if I could arrange for hospitalization.
医生说新冠确诊病人都是去协和西院，但那里也没有床位了。
Doctors say patients diagnosed with the new crown go to the Concorde West Court, but there are no beds.
这一切我都明白，我不奢求有床位。
I know all this. I don't ask for a bed.
我就一直求医生哪怕是一个留观的位置也行。
I always asked the doctor for even a visiting position.
最后，医生让我把妈妈送去4楼的留观室。
Finally, the doctor asked me to take my mother to the viewing room on the fourth floor.
那里是一个两人间，我真的很感激，也很满意了。
It was a double room, and I was really grateful and satisfied.
但当时我妈的情况已经很差了，有床也不能躺，会影响呼吸，只能一直坐在轮椅上。
But my mother was already in a bad condition, unable to lie down with a bed, would affect breathing, only to sit in a wheelchair all the time.
这期间，我才知道，母亲曾陪舅舅去医院看过一次病，而我舅已经在武汉市中心医院住院，是新冠确诊病人。
During this time, I learned that my mother had accompanied my uncle to the hospital to see an illness, and my uncle had been hospitalized in Wuhan Central Hospital, a newly diagnosed patient.
这种情况下，安顿完我妈，我立马在医院对面租了一个民宿，回家收拾了一下，把我儿子和爸爸接过去住，一人一间房隔离。
In this case, immediately after settling down my mother, I rented a house opposite the hospital, went home to pack it up, and took over my son and father, one by one.
当时，我儿子也有点发烧了，而我爸浑身乏力。
At the time, my son had a fever, and my father was weak.
李甜的微信头像1月31日，儿子发烧到39度，我赶紧带着他去医院。
On January 31, my son had a fever of 39 degrees and I rushed him to the hospital.
我爸那时不愿意去，说他走不动。
My father didn't want to go and said he couldn't walk.
儿子在医院吊了针，也做了核酸检测。
My son hung a needle in the hospital and tested for nucleic acid.
第二天，我硬拖着父亲去医院也做了核酸。
The next day, I dragged my father to the hospital and made nucleic acids.
最后，检测结果出来，我妈是双强阳确认，我和爸爸是双阳确认，我儿子单阳确认。
Finally, the test results come out, my mother is Shuangyang confirmation, my father and I are Shuangyang confirmation, my son Shan Yang confirmed.
这个检测结果也是一波三折，本来是说确诊病人才会收到短信，但我一直没有收到我妈的短信。
The results were mixed. It was supposed to mean that the patient would receive a text message, but I never received one from my mother.
一开始医生说没有收到就不是，还让我放心。
At first the doctor told me it wasn't. It reassured me.
我坚持让医生用电脑帮我查，一看果然是确诊。
I insisted that the doctor use the computer to help me look up, it was confirmed.
我自己一个确诊病人，那几天，就拖着这样一个身体，可以说是身分三处照顾家里人。
One of my own confirmed patients, that a few days, dragging such a body, can be said to be three places to care for the family.
幸好老天爷最后的怜悯，我一点症状都没有，不然这个家就彻底垮了。
Fortunately, God's last mercy, I did not have any symptoms, otherwise the family completely collapsed.
也幸好我没有传染给未婚夫，但他也使不上力，不能过来帮我。
Fortunately, I did not infect my fiance, but he is also unable to help me.
他家也有瘫痪的母亲需要他照顾。
His mother, who was paralysed, also needed his care.
拿到确诊的报告，我又电话了社区，问他们怎么办，当时他们只说了会上报。
When I got the report of the diagnosis, I called the community again and asked what they would do when they said they would report back.
2月3日下午，我接到社区的电话，让我们去红会医院等，说是像我们这种确诊的轻症病人会安排去方舱医院。
On the afternoon of February 3, I received a phone call from the community asking us to go to the Red Cross Hospital.
我便开车把他俩送了过去，我又回到协和医院照顾我妈。
I drove them over and I went back to Concorde Hospital to look after my mother.
当晚，我爸是在空床上，而我儿子就在板凳上坐了一晚。
That night, my father was in an empty bed and my son sat on the bench for the night.
当时，虽然不知道方舱医院是怎么回事，但总算让我有了喘息，至少儿子和爸爸不用太担心，我可以一心一意照顾我妈。
At the time, I didn't know what was going on at the Fang Causeway Hospital, but it gave me some respite. At least my son and dad didn't have to worry too much.
她情况真的不太好，不能吃，不能喝，只能靠输液维持。
She was really in a bad condition, unable to eat, unable to drink, had to rely on infusion to maintain.
这种病现在也没什么特效药，只能靠自身的免疫力，我已经花了一两万元帮她输了各种蛋白。
The disease has no specific cure, and I have to rely on her immune system, I have spent 10,000 yuan to help her lose a variety of protein.
2月4日，儿子和父亲被接去了指定的宾馆继续等待。
On 4 February, the son and father were taken to a designated hotel to continue to wait.
但当天，我妈的病情急转直下，整个脸都肿了，血氧量也从之前靠吸氧可以达到90以上，变成了六十几。
But on that day, my mother's condition suddenly fell, the whole face swollen, blood oxygen from the oxygen can reach more than 90, become more than 60.
医生怎么做都不见好转，看着我妈全身插满了管子，我纠结犹豫了好久，最后和医生说“算了，不想再看着我妈妈痛苦”。
The doctor did not do anything to improve, watching my mother filled with tubes, I hesitated for a long time, and finally said to the doctor, "never, do not want to see my mother pain."
他们就由4个人把我妈抬上了床，我妈那时已经小便失禁，轮椅上全湿了。
They were taken to bed by four people and my mother was incontinent and totally wet in her wheelchair.
我给儿子打了个视频电话，让他和外婆见上最后一面。
I made a video call to my son to let him see Grandma for the last time.
我儿子和我妈的感情很好，当时他喊着：“外婆你振作点，你要好起来。
My son and my mother were in good terms when he yelled, "Grandma, pick yourself up, you better get better.
”而我爸始终不愿面对。
"And my father didn't want to face it.
我儿子告诉我，外公就一直在床上躺着，不愿说话也不理他。
My son told me that Grandpa had been lying in bed, refusing to talk or talk to him.
我知道，我爸当时是崩溃的。
I know. my dad was a wreck.
2月5日凌晨，母亲最终没能熬过去，全身都是肿的。
In the early hours of February 5, my mother was unable to make it through, and her whole body was swollen.
我看着她咽下了最后一口气，瞳孔慢慢放大，眼泪已经不知道留了多少。
I watched her swallow her last breath, her pupils dilating slowly, tears already do not know how much remained.
母亲怪过我，说为什么这些天都见不到我人。
Mother freaks me out about why she can't see me these days.
我真的没办法，除了几头跑，每次医生开个什么药，因为是全报销的，都要去登记再去指定的地方拿，离得很远。
I really can't do anything but run, every time the doctor write something, because it is fully reimbursed, have to go to the designated place to pick up, far away.
像这种病人的遗体也是要特殊处理的，医院给了我电话，让我自己联系殡仪馆。
The body of a patient like this also needs special treatment. The hospital called me and asked me to contact the funeral home myself.
然后他们很快就来了，用了几层黄色、白色的袋子把母亲带走了，告诉我15天后去拿骨灰。
Then they came in a few yellow, white bags and took my mother away. They told me to get the ashes 15 days later.
处理完母亲的后事，来不及伤心太久，我也去了红会医院等，但因为第一批的时候我不在。
After handling the mother's post-event, too late to grieve for too long, I also went to the Red Cross Hospital and so on, but because I was not in the first batch.
2月5日晚上，我儿子和我爸先被送进了位于武汉国际会展中心的江汉方舱医院。
On the night of Feb. 5, my son and my father were first taken to the Jiang Han Square Hospital in Wuhan International Convention and Exhibition Center.
他们是第一批，新华社拍的照片里就有他们。
They were the first. They were in the pictures taken by Xinhua.
儿子和父亲去医院的路上图中的小朋友就是李甜15岁的儿子，身旁戴蓝色帽子的老人是她71岁的父亲（图：新华社）我就在医院的椅子上躺了一晚，听说是第二天一早会安排我们。
The children in the picture on the way to the hospital were Li Tian's 15-year-old son and her 71-year-old father in a blue hat next to her.
她自己在红会医院的椅子上度过了一晚2月6日，和儿子微信沟通得知，他和我爸是挨着的两张床，那里给他们发了洗漱用品。
After spending the night in a ICRC hospital chair on February 6, she talked to her son and learned that he and my father were in two beds next to each other, where they were given toiletries.
有供电，也有电热毯。
There's electricity and electric blankets.
并不是网上传的没电很冷，在这种情况下还瞎传一些负面的东西太可恶了。
Is not online transmission of electricity is very cold, in this case, it is too abhorrent to blindly spread some negative things.
但我儿子说，厕所是真的非常脏。
But my son said the toilet was really dirty.
他说：“妈妈，这种厕所你肯定受不了的。
"You can't stand this kind of toilet, Mom," he said.
”他所在的病房一共50人一间，但只有四个医生和两个护士，感觉有点忙不过来。
His room, which was shared by 50 people but had only four doctors and two nurses, felt a bit overwhelmed.
6日，大约是早上10点才发了早餐，很简单。
On the 6th, breakfast was served at about 10 am. It was very simple.
然后晚上发了药，我儿子也拍给我看了，都是一些中成药，我感觉没什么用。
Then in the evening, I took some medicine, and my son showed me some Chinese patent medicine. I don't feel useful.
我就让儿子一定要好好吃东西，照顾好外公，也让他吃东西，这样才有力气与疾病斗争。
I let my son must eat good food, take good care of grandfather, also let him eat things, so that the strength to fight disease.
而我自己在红会医院只有等，现场情况也非常乱。
I had to wait at the Red Cross hospital and the scene was very chaotic.
一方面社区不断送人过来，有的根本还没确诊是来检查的，但他们不知道也混在里面；另一方面，完全没有车子送我们去的意思。
On the one hand, the community keeps sending people over, and some have not been diagnosed at all, but they don't know how to mix them up; on the other hand, there is no sense of having a car with us.
就看到大厅里人越来越多，大家逐渐失去了耐心。
Seeing more and more people in the hall, we gradually lost patience.
原本大家都坐着等我也看到有些人被从方舱送了回来，因为那里只收轻症患者，这些人的血氧量低了，应该是送火神山、雷神山这种地方的。
People were sitting there waiting for me to see some of them come back from the cabin because there were only light patients whose blood oxygen levels were low and it was supposed to be in places like Mount Flamingo or Mount Raytheon.
就这样我又在红会医院的椅子上坐了一晚，还好医院是提供盒饭的。
So I sat on the chair of the Red Cross hospital for another night. Fortunately, the hospital offered boxed meals.
2月7日下午，因为迟迟看不到安排，很多人像我一样在这里已经待了两晚了，体力都快透支了。
On the afternoon of February 7, many people, like me, had been here for two nights and were running out of energy because of the delay in scheduling.
有人开始“闹”，警察都来了。
Someone's starting to make a scene. The cops are here.
我也是非常迫切地想要看到父亲和儿子。
I also want to see my father and my son very badly.
最终总算安排了车子，把我们这批人送去了方舱医院。
Finally, the car was arranged and the group of us were taken to the cabin hospital.
到了之后，有医生过来询问了我们的情况，也发了晚餐，有荤有素，也是热的。
When we arrived, some doctors came to ask us about our situation, and we served dinner, which was well-trained and hot.
但我到得比较晚，就没有给我们发药。
But I arrived late and didn't give us any medicine.
我儿子说今天发了一些号称是对这个病很有效的中药。
My son said that he had some Chinese medicine today that was claimed to be very effective against the disease.
这里是可以走动的，男女病区也可以偶尔串门。
Here is can walk, the male and female sick area also occasionally visits the door.
但因为我情况比较特殊，我跟他们说了，儿子和父亲都住在这里，他们就让我随时可以过去照顾他们。
But because of my special circumstances, I told them that my son and father lived here and they let me come and take care of them at any time.
总算见到他们了，我也放心了。
I finally met them, and I was relieved.
他俩总体精神都不错。
Both of them are in good spirits.
但我爸好像是因为吃了中药，胃不是很舒服。
But my dad didn't seem to have a comfortable stomach because he took Chinese medicine.
Play李甜拍摄的视频，认为方舱医院环境尚可我觉得整体条件还是可以的，就是除了住的地方干净之外，厕所、洗漱的地方都真的是太脏了。
Play Lee video, that the cabin hospital environment is OK I think the overall conditions can be, except for the clean place, toilets, gargle places are really too dirty.
不过，今天（2月8日）上午，经过很多患者的抗议，工作人员已经把厕所打扫了一下，现在还是满干净的。
But this morning (Feb. 8), after protests from many patients, workers have cleaned the toilet, which is still clean.
移动厕所水房还是有些脏我早上起来有些头晕，胃也不知道是不是因为吃了药的关系反应有些大，过一会儿准备再去问问医生。
I got up a little dizzy in the morning, and I don't know if it was due to the reaction of taking medicine, so I will go to see my doctor later.
不过昨晚，医生查房的时候告诉我，我的病情是在好转的，相信很快可以出院了。
But last night, when the doctor checked in, he told me that I was getting better and that I would be discharged soon.
我父亲和儿子今天的状态也都不错，父亲还提出要喝皮蛋瘦肉粥，我给他点了个外卖。
My father and son were in good shape today, and my father offered to have skinny porridge. I ordered him a takeaway.
今天13时左右，医院提供的午餐，还发了水果一家人在方舱医院的合影我觉得，我们是来这里治病的，这种临时搭建起来的地方，基本生活条件能够满足就可以了。
Today, at about 1300, lunch at the hospital, and a photo of the fruit family at the Fang Caves Hospital, I think we're here to treat diseases, this makeshift place, the basic living conditions can be met.
特殊时期，大家需要互相谅解。
In special times, people need to understand each other.
这些天，我打过市长热线，也求助过社区，尽管都有难处，但最后都给了我很多帮助，包括我所在的单位。
These days, I called the mayor's hotline and asked for help from the community, and despite my difficulties, I ended up giving me a lot of help, including my unit.
期间，大家因为各种各样的原因，有情绪在所难免，但现在回过头去想，一定还是要相信政府。
During the period, we all for a variety of reasons, emotional inevitable, but now look back on it, must still trust the government.
相信一切很快可以好起来。
I believe everything will get better soon.
