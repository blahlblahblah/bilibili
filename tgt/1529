受访者供图张禹家已经独守酒店24天了，每天一个人既当前台又当清洁员。
Respondents to Tu Zhang Yuk family has guarded the hotel alone for 24 days, a person each day both as a station and as a cleaner.
天亮时，他目送医护人员急匆匆离开，到了深夜，又为疲惫的他们打开一扇门，这是他认为目前最有意义的事情。
At daybreak he watched the paramedics rush away, and in the middle of the night he opened a door for the weary.
除夕夜晚，在和家人简单沟通后，90后的张禹家决定开放已经停业2天的酒店，加入“武汉医护酒店支援联盟”，免费给医护人员提供住宿和服务。
On New Year's Eve, after a brief communication with his family, the 90-day-old Zhang Yuk decided to open a hotel that had been closed for two days and join the Wuhan Healthcare Hotels Support League to provide accommodation and services free of charge.
一周后，因人员疲惫，联盟内的多数酒店都纷纷退出，但张禹家却坚持了下来，继续守护着50位入住的医护人员。
A week later, tired of staff, most of the hotels in the league withdrew, but Zhang Yuk persisted, continuing to guard the 50 hospital staff.

受访者供图一个人守着一个酒店91年出生的张禹家，在武汉市第一医院旁经营着一家名为锦汉的商务酒店，酒店两三公里的范围内，有武汉协和医院和第四医院。
The interviewee shows Zhang Yuk, a 91-year-old hotel, who runs a business hotel called Jinhan next to Wuhan First Hospital. Within two or three kilometers of the hotel, there are Wuhan Concorde Hospital and the 4th Hospital.
今年的大年三十（1月24日），一张医护人员在科室内吃饭，因压力过大而痛哭的照片，触动了张禹家和他的家人。
This year's New Year's Eve (January 24), a medical staff eating in the department, because of the stress and crying photos, touched Zhang Yuk and his family.
“当时我母亲说我们离医院近，提议把酒店开放给医护人员，给他们提供一个休息的地方。
"My mother said we were close to the hospital and offered to open the hotel to paramedics and give them a place to rest.
”张禹家说，听到母亲的提议，家人都非常支持。
Zhang Yuk's family said they were very supportive when they heard their mother's proposal.
但当时，张禹家的酒店已经停止营业了2天，服务员们也都已经放假回家，一家人就谁去管理酒店的问题，产生了争执，“我父亲听到后立刻要去，但我觉得自己最年轻，抵抗力强，最终决定我去看店。
But Zhang Yuk's hotel had been closed for two days, and the attendants had all returned home. The family quarreled over who should run the hotel. "My father wanted to go right away, but I felt the youngest and most resistant, and finally decided to go to the store.
”同样是这个除夕夜，武汉数百位酒店业内人员自发组建了“武汉医护酒店支援联盟”，免费给医护人员提供住宿和服务，张禹家得知后立即报名参加。
On the same New Year's Eve, hundreds of Wuhan hotel staff spontaneously formed the Wuhan Healthcare Hotels Support League to provide accommodation and services free of charge to medical staff.
大年初一早上，在打扫并消毒了整个酒店后，他敞开了大门，开始接待医护人员。
On the morning of New Year's Day, after cleaning and disinfecting the entire hotel, he opened the door and began to receive medical staff.
当天中午到次日凌晨，酒店就入住了40名协和医院的医护人员。
Between noon and early morning, 40 Concorde hospital staff were admitted to the hotel.
“他们有些医护人员离家比较远，封城后没有公共交通，回家不方便，还有些医护人员担心把病毒带回家，就住在酒店里。
"Some of them live far away from home, there is no public transportation after the siege, it is inconvenient for them to go home, and some doctors and nurses are afraid to take the virus home and stay in hotels.
”张禹家告诉澎湃新闻（www.thepaper.cn），入住酒店的医护人员中90后的居多，其中最小的一个护士是97年出生的，今年还不到23岁。
The Zhang family told Peng Pai News (www.thepper.cn) that more than 90 of the hotel's medical staff were admitted, the youngest of whom was born in 1997 and is under the age of 23.
酒店一共有56间房，张禹家为医护人员提供了50间。
There were 56 rooms in the hotel, and the Zhang family provided 50 for the medical staff.
为了安全起见，每间房都只住一个人，在开放的第二天就已经住满了。
To be on the safe side, each room was occupied by only one person and was occupied the day after the opening.
中间有医护人员退房，张禹家就会立即进行清理、消毒，不久就会有新的医护人员住进来。
In the middle of the medical staff check out, Zhang Yuk will immediately clean up, disinfect, will soon have new medical personnel to live in.
自从年初一开门后，张禹家就没有再回过一次家，一个人负责酒店的所有工作。
Since the opening of the first day of the New Year, Zhang Yuk did not return home, a person in charge of all the hotel work.
为了保障安全，他每天都会在走廊、把手、电梯等公共区域消毒两次，用加压喷壶，喷洒二氧化氯进行消毒。
To ensure his safety, he disinfects public areas twice a day in corridors, handlebars, elevators, etc., using pressurized spray kettles and chlorine dioxide.
酒店除了医护人员外，其他人员都禁止进入，包括外卖。
The hotel is off limits to all but medical staff, including takeaway.
酒店没有做饭的地方，父亲偶尔会给他送饭过来。
There was no place to cook, and my father occasionally brought him food.
因担心家人出门不安全，大多数时候张禹家都是以吃泡面为主。
Most of the time Zhang Yuk's family lived mainly on bubble noodles because they feared that their families would not be safe to go out.
只有在元宵节的时候，他煮了满满一锅的汤圆，送给每一位入住的医护人员。
Only in the Lantern Festival, he cooked a pot full of soup Yuan, given to every check-in medical personnel.
给医护人员留一扇门虽然酒店的房间几乎都住满，但医护人员们出于保护张禹家，很少和他近距离接触，出门前的一声招呼，见面时的一句谢谢，都让张禹家很感动。
Although the hotel room almost full, but the medical staff out to protect Zhang Yuk, rarely close contact with him, out of the door to say hello, the meeting a thank you, Zhang Yuk was very moved.
“有时他们还会给我带吃的，经常告诉我辛苦了，但其实我什么事情都没做，真正辛苦的是他们。
"Sometimes they bring me food and often tell me that I'm hard up, but I don't do anything. It's them who really work hard.
”张禹家说，自己每天要穿着防护服和口罩给医护人员打扫房间，由于衣服不透气，即使在寒冷的冬天，差不多1个小时全身的衣服就会湿透了，“所以我特别能感受到医护人员每天穿防护服在医院里上一天班的不容易。
Eunson Zhang said he had to wear protective clothing and masks every day to clean the room. Because of the airtight clothing, even on a cold winter day, almost an hour of clothes would be soaked.
”由于入住的医护人员不是一个科室的，大家下班时间也不一样。
As the staff were not in the same section, the shift hours were different.
张禹家每晚都要起来六七次给医护人员开门，“有很多人怕打扰我休息，不好意思给我打电话，还有的每次进来都一直说抱歉。
Zhang Yuk family every night to get up six or seven times to the medical staff, "a lot of people are afraid to disturb my rest, sorry to call me, and some always come in to say sorry.
”张禹家说，曾经还有一位护士，因为下班太晚，为了不打扰他休息，直接留在科室里凑合了一夜，“我那天就和她说，真的没有必要，即使你不回来，我已经习惯了，一晚上还是会起六七次。
Zhang Yuk said that there had been a nurse who stayed in the office all night too late to disturb his rest. "I told her that it was really not necessary, and even if you didn't come back, I would get used to it six or seven times a night.
”为了不打扰张禹家休息，之后有人提议：如果是一个科室的、或者是认识的，可以先在医护群里问一下有没有睡觉、是否可以帮忙开门，如果实在是没有人开门，才打张禹家的电话。
In order not to disturb Zhang's family rest, it was proposed that if it was a department or if they knew each other, they could ask in the medical group if they were sleeping, if they could help open the door, or if there was no one to open the door, then they would call Zhang Yuk.
但张禹家觉得没有必要，“我做这个工作，就是想给他们留一个门，疲惫的时候能有地方休息，再晚都有人等他们回家。
But Zhang Yuk did not feel the need, "I do this job, is to give them a door, tired when there is a place to rest, and late people wait for them to go home.
”1月31日，“武汉医护酒店支援联盟”发布公告，表示由于缺乏急需的物资和资金资源，多数酒店的人员已经极度疲惫，从31日起，联盟内的159家酒店将不再接待医护人员和客人。
On January 31, the Wuhan Healthcare Hotels Support League (Wuhan Healthcare Hotels Support League) issued a statement saying most hotel staff were severely exhausted by lack of much-needed material and financial resources.
但张禹家决定坚持下来，“很多酒店退出了，因为他们不知道这个时间会持续那么长，但我一定会坚持下去，只希望疫情早点结束，因为医护人员真的太辛苦了。
But Zhang Yuk decided to stick to it. "A lot of hotels quit because they didn't know it would last that long, but I will stick to it, hoping that the epidemic will end soon, because the medical staff is really too hard.
”自年初一进入酒店后，张禹家已经20多天没有见过1岁半的儿子，他告诉澎湃新闻，现在就想坚持到疫情结束，他能安安心心的回家，带着孩子出门玩耍。
Since entering the hotel on the first day of the new year, Zhang Yuk's family had not seen his son for more than 20 days. He told the stormy news that he wanted to stay there until the epidemic was over and he could go home and play with his children.
