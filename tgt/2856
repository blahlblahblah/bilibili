3 月 4 日，武汉市多家方舱医院收到紧急通知，暂停办理病人出院，对于出院的新冠患者施行更加严格的检测标准和审核流程，第二天就要正式开始落实。
On March 4, several cabin hospitals in Wuhan received emergency notice, suspended the discharge of patients from the hospital, imposed more stringent testing standards and procedures for patients discharged from the hospital, and will formally start implementation the next day.
此前，有的方舱医院每天有 30、40 名患者出院。
Previously, some cabin hospitals discharged between 30 and 40 patients a day.
据澎湃、界面等多方报道，此举是为避免更多 “复发”“返阳” 现象。
According to numerous reports, such as surging, interface, this is to avoid more "relapse" and "re-yang" phenomenon.
近期，符合新冠肺炎出院标准或者已出院的患者在复检时又呈阳性的病例频繁出现。
Recently, patients who have met the discharge criteria for Newcomb Pneumonia or have been discharged from the hospital are frequently found to be positive at the time of re-examination.
早在 2 月 24 日，武汉大学人民医院呼吸与危重症医学科副主任医师、副教授张旃就发出警示，在临床检疫过程中，研究人员将符合国家卫健委出院标准的患者 18 人延迟出院，继续复查咽拭子核酸时发现 13 名患者在第三次检测中出现阳性结果。
As early as February 24, Chandrag Chang, deputy director and associate professor of respiratory and critical medicine at Wuhan University's People's Hospital, warned that during the clinical quarantine process, researchers delayed the release of 18 patients who met the National Fitness Commission's discharge criteria, and continued to review swabs for nucleic acids.
2 月 27 日，武汉大学中南医院放射科和检验科的一份临床报告也显示，4 例符合新冠肺炎医院出院或停止检疫标准的患者，在 5～13 天后 RT-PCR 检测又呈阳性。
On February 27, a clinical report from the Radiology and Laboratory Department of Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital also showed that four patients who met the criteria for discharge or cessation of quarantine were tested positive for RT-PCR after 5 to 13 days.
类似情况不仅在国内出现，国外亦有案例。
Similar situations occur not only at home, but also abroad.
一名日本妇女于 1 月下旬被确诊患有 COVID-19，在治疗后病情缓解且核酸检测呈阴性后便出院了，三周后，她因喉咙痛和胸闷等病状重返医院检查，测试结果为阳性；韩国中央防疫对策本部发布的病例则显示，一位韩国女性在 2 月初被确诊为新冠肺炎，经过针对性的医疗和护理，于 2 月 22 日治愈出院，但仅隔了 5 天，她却再次出现了新冠肺炎的相关症状并略有加重，2 月 29 日再次入院治疗。
A Japanese woman was diagnosed with COVID-19 in late January, was released after remission from treatment and tested negative for nucleic acid. Three weeks later, she returned to the hospital with a sore throat and chest tightness.
对此，武汉大学人民医院教授、检验科主任李艳对 DeepTech 说，类似出院时检测阴性，复检又变阳性的案例，除了可能是采样、检测不到位不够全面之外，当下也存在诸多检疫方法学局限性，而且，个别人体的免疫力、抗体强弱存在差异，不排除会有二次交叉感染导致复检出阳性的可能。
In addition to possible inadequacies in sampling and detection, there are a number of current quarantine methodological limitations, and differences in individual human immunity, antibody strengths and weaknesses do not rule out the possibility of retesting positive for secondary cross-infection, Li Yan, a professor at Wuhan University People's Hospital and director of examination, told DeepTech.
在新冠疫情攻坚期，我们迫切希望快速提升治愈出院患者的比例，尽快消化掉基数较大的确诊病人数量，但确保出院患者是真的康复了，不会再造成病情复发或新发感染更为重要，这都对一线新冠患者出院检疫评估提出了新的挑战。
During the New Crown Epidemic period, we are eager to rapidly increase the proportion of patients discharged from hospital and to digest as soon as possible the number of confirmed patients with a large base. However, it is important to ensure that patients who are discharged from the hospital recover rather than relapse or new infections.
图｜身穿防护服的医护人员与患者家属交谈（来源：路透社）相关研究登上权威医学期刊对于本已判定为痊愈、在复检时又呈阳性的病例，也引起医学权威期刊的关注。
Health care workers in protective clothing talk to family members of sufferers (Source: Reuters) Research published in authoritative medical journals has also drawn the attention of medical authorities to cases that have been judged healed and tested positive at the time of reexamination.
武汉大学中南医院放射科和检验科的研究人员于 2 月 27 日发表在美国医学会杂志 JAMA network 上的临床报告显示，2020 年 1 月 1 日至 2020 年 2 月 15 日，武汉大学中南医院收治了 1 名住院患者和 3 名在家接受 COVID-19 检疫的患者，4 人均为医务人员，通过用实时逆转录 - 聚合酶链反应（RT-PCR）检测 COVID-19 核酸，以确认他们是否能重返工作岗位。
A clinical report published Feb. 27 in the Journal of the American Medical Association's JAMA network showed that between January 1, 2020 and February 15, 2020, Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital admitted one inpatient and three patients who were quarantined by COVID-19, all medical staff, to confirm their ability to return to work.
测试方法是对患者喉部拭子进行 RT-PCR 检测，均使用由中国疾病预防控制中心推荐的 RT-PCR 检测试剂盒（BioGerm）。
The test method is RT-PCR for swabs in the throat, using RT-PCR test kits (BioGerm) recommended by the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
检测结果显示这 4 名医务人员 RT-PCR 均呈阳性，CT 影像表现为磨玻璃样混浊或混合磨玻璃样混浊，病情从轻到中度不等。
The results showed that the four patients were positive for RT-PCR. CT images showed that the cases ranged from mildly to moderately cloudy glass-like opacity.
随后他们接受了抗病毒治疗（每 12 小时口服 75 毫克奥司他韦），之后，4 例患者均连续 2 次 RT-PCR 检测呈阴性，从症状出现到恢复的时间为 12～32 天。
They were then given antiviral treatment (75 mg of oseltamivir every 12 hours), after which all four patients tested negative for RT-PCR two times in a row, 12 to 32 days from the onset of symptoms to recovery.
随后，他们的状况符合了国家卫健委发布的《新型冠状病毒肺炎诊疗方案（试行第六版）》中，关于解除隔离和出院的四条标准：1、体温恢复正常 3 天以上；2. 呼吸道症状明显好转；3. 肺部影像学显示急性渗出性病变明显吸收好转；4. 连续两次呼吸道标本核酸检测阴性（采样时间至少间隔 1 天）。
Subsequently, their condition was in line with the four criteria of the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment (Trial Version 6) issued by the National Health Commission: 1. Temperature returned to normal for more than 3 days; 2. Respiratory symptoms improved markedly; 3.
在出院或停止检疫后，这 4 名医务人员被要求在家继续检疫 5 天。
After discharge or suspension of quarantine, the four medical staff members were asked to remain in their homes for five days.
然而，令人不安的情况出现了。
However, a disturbing situation has emerged.
5～13 天后重复 RT-PCR 检测时，结果均为阳性，在接下来的 4-5 天内又进行了 3 次重复的 RT-PCR 检测，仍为阳性，使用不同制造商的试剂盒进行额外的 RT-PCR 检测，结果依然是阳性。
When RT-PCR was repeated 5-13 days later, the results were positive, and three repeated RT-PCR tests were performed in the next 4-5 days. They were still positive, and additional RT-PCR tests were performed using kits from different manufacturers and the results remained positive.
该报告的作者提示，可能需要重新评估出院或停止检疫的现行标准。
The authors of the report suggest that there may be a need to reassess existing standards for discharge or cessation of quarantine.
愈后短期复发？专家称几乎不可能为什么会出现这类情况？难道说新冠肺炎患者治愈后还会复发？李艳认为概率还是有的。
After the short-term recurrence? Experts say it is almost impossible why this kind of situation? It is difficult to say that patients with new crown pneumonia will relapse? Li Yan thinks the probability is still there.
她告诉 DeepTech，这跟个人的免疫力和抗体强度有关，如果抗体峰值本身不够且又恰巧与携带病毒的病人在一起，那再次被病毒入侵感染的情况就可能发生。
She told DeepTech that this is related to an individual's immunity and antibody strength, which can happen if the peak antibody itself is not enough and happens to be with a patient carrying the virus.
但香港大学生物医学学院病毒学专家金冬雁教授的看法不同，他对 DeepTech 表示，治愈患者短期内二次患病几乎不可能。
But Professor Jin Dong-yan, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong's School of Biomedical Sciences, told DeepTech that it is almost impossible to cure patients with a second illness in the short term.
过往对 SARS-CoV 的研究表明，中和抗体在两年内仍很高，MERS-CoV 抗体也有 9 个月。
Previous studies of SARS-CoV have shown that neutralizing antibodies remain high for two years, and that MERS-CoV antibodies are also available for nine months.
而且即使抗体已经很低，再次遇到抗原时免疫细胞有记忆，抗体和保护性细胞免疫（例如细胞毒性 T 细胞）还是会大量产生，保护机体免受感染，这也是疫苗（主动免疫）以及血清治疗（被动免疫）的基础，对所有病原都一样。
And even when antibodies are already low, immune cells remember when they reencounter antigens, and antibodies and protective cellular immunity (such as cytotoxic T-cells) are produced in large quantities to protect the organism from infection, which is the basis of vaccines (active immunization) and sero-therapy (passive immunization) for all pathogens.
区分是否复发，测定抗体就可以，将来有抗原测定试剂也可以辅助诊断，将核酸检测定量化及动态化做好，也能够说明一些问题，但如果这些试验都没有做，说治愈后复发那就是空口无凭的猜想了。
Distinguishing whether or not to relapse, determination of antibodies, future antigen detection reagents can also assist in diagnosis, quantitative and dynamic nucleic acid detection, but if none of these tests are done, then a relapse after cure is an empty guess.
明尼苏达大学的传染病医生和流行病学家苏珊 · 克莱恩（Susan Kline）也认为，理论上来讲没有足够的时间再次感染。
Susan Kline, an infectious-diseases physician and epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, agrees that, in theory, there isn't enough time to reinfect.
针对外来病毒，人们在感染、治愈后往往会形成免疫力，虽说免疫力不会永远持续下去，但人体产生的抗体可以防止随后短期内的接触感染，然后随着时间的推移，免疫反应减弱。
People develop immunity to foreign viruses after infection and cure, and while immunity does not last forever, antibodies produced by the body can prevent subsequent short-term exposure and then weaken the immune response over time.
不过这个过程至少也需要超过三周的时间。
But the process will take at least three weeks.
“时间间隔太短了。
"The interval is too short.
”克莱恩说。
"said Crane.
“整个疫情只持续了两个月。
"The whole outbreak lasted only two months.
人们在这段时间内治愈又重新受到感染的可能性非常小。
The likelihood of people being cured and re-infected during this period is very low.
”图｜医护人员与出院的新冠肺炎痊愈患者作别（来源：网络）匹兹堡大学的国际健康专家唐纳德 · 伯克（Donald Burke）在接受《连线》采访时表示，区分复发和再感染的唯一方法是检测完整的病毒序列，在这种情况下，可以查看是否有第二个冠状病毒株在第一个病毒株被清除后又入侵了人体。
In an interview with Wired, Donald Burke, an international health expert at the University of Pittsburgh, said the only way to distinguish between relapse and reinfection is to test for a complete sequence of viruses, in which case you can see if a second coronavirus strain invades after the first strain has been cleared.
当下用于诊断新冠肺炎检测的多是 RT-PCR 的方法，这种方法靠提取病毒的一些基因代码进行识别，它被设计成只抓取新冠状病毒特有的片段而非全部，由于某种特殊的荧光染料反应，病毒的数量越多，遗传物质发光越亮，以此表明病毒的存在。
The current method, RT-PCR, which detects the presence of the virus by extracting some of its genetic code, is designed to capture only fragments unique to the new coronavirus, but not all of it. The more the virus reacts with a particular fluorescent dye, the brighter the genetic material will glow, indicating the presence of the virus.
理论上，如果医生在每一次确诊时都对患者的鼻子或口腔拭子中的病毒进行了完全测序，他们就可以使用基因组读取软件对每一个基因字母进行比较，确定患者是否有相同的冠状病毒株或新的冠状病毒株。
In theory, if doctors had completely sequenced the viruses from a patient's nose or oral swab at each diagnosis, they would have been able to use genome-reading software to compare each gene letter to determine whether the patient had the same coronavirus strain or a new coronavirus strain.
“没有这些数据，就无法确定。
"Without these data, it is impossible to determine.
“伯克说，因为任何数据如果表明人们在治愈后短期内还能再次被感染新冠病毒，都可能对疫情的公共卫生响应产生巨大的影响。
"Berk said that because any data that shows that people can be infected with the new crown virus again in the short term after a cure can have a huge impact on the public health response to the outbreak.
可能是原始感染的延续那么，国内外出现的多起痊愈患者复检呈阳性，背后原因究竟是什么？“我怀疑这实际上是原始感染的延续。
It could be a continuation of the original infection So what are the reasons behind the many positive rechecks that have occurred at home and abroad? I suspect it is actually a continuation of the original infection.
”苏珊 · 克莱恩表示，新冠病毒在某些人体内的停留时间比我们预期的更长。
Susan Klein says the new crown virus has stayed in some people longer than we had expected.
在克莱恩看来，出院检测不够敏感，可能导致无法发现病毒的踪迹。
In Klein's view, discharge tests were not sensitive enough to allow detection of traces of the virus.
目前用于诊断新冠肺炎的 RT-PCR 检测需要大量的遗传物质才能正常工作。
At present, RT-PCR, which is used to diagnose new crown pneumonia, needs a lot of genetic material to work properly.
如果冠状病毒正在积极地复制，那么会有大量的 RNA 供检测，但如果病毒载量下降，测试可能会产生假阴性。
If the coronavirus is actively duplicating, then there will be a lot of RNA available for testing, but if the viral load falls, the test could produce false negatives.
此外，还有更多可能，比如因为病人的免疫系统产生了强烈的反应，短期集中的治疗减缓了冠状病毒的自我复制，还有可能是样本很糟糕，因为拭子一开始并没有沾到多少含病毒的体液。
Moreover, it is more likely, for example, that short-term intensive treatment slowed self-replication of the coronavirus, owing to the patient's immune system's strong response, and that the sample was poor, because swab did not start with much body fluid containing the virus.
金冬雁提示，我们需要关注的问题是，病人是否接受过激素治疗，以及是否治疗不当，试用了哪些免疫抑制作用的中西药物，这些情况有可能导致了病程延长及病毒清除的过程减缓。
As geese suggest, we need to be concerned about whether patients have received hormone therapy and whether they have been treated improperly, and what immunosuppressive drugs, both Chinese and Western, have been tried, which may have contributed to the prolongation of the disease and the slowing down of the virus elimination process.
也就是说，专家们倾向于认为这些复检再次呈阳性的痊愈患者，之前并没有痊愈，而是在出院检疫时出现了问题，没有检出患者携带的病毒，给出了 “假阴性” 结果。
In other words, experts tend to assume that the recovered patients who were re-tested positive had not recovered before, but had problems with discharge quarantine, did not detect the virus, and gave a "false negative" result.
早在疫情暴发初期确诊新冠病患时，“假阴性”就是一个大困扰，如今，在患者出院时又不可避免再次碰到此类问题。
"False-negative" cases were a major concern long before the outbreak was first diagnosed, and are now inevitable again when patients leave the hospital.
检测次数少肯定是一个重要原因。
The low number of tests is certainly an important factor.
如武汉大学人民医院呼吸与危重症医学科副主任医师、副教授张旃提到的情况，已符合国家出院标准的 18 名患者，在共计 5 次核酸检测中，其中 13 名第三次检测结果仍为阳性，如果任由患者出院回家，那么复检阳性的概率是很大的，因此张旃提议，出院标准上调为至少连续 3 次呼吸道标本核酸检测阴性。
As mentioned by Chandrae Chang, deputy director and associate professor of respiratory and critical medicine at Wuhan University's People's Hospital, 18 patients who met the national discharge criteria were tested positive for the third time. Of a total of five nucleic acid tests, 13 were positive.
同时，武汉大学人民医院教授、检验科主任李艳认为，此前第六版新型冠状病毒肺炎诊疗方案出院标准其实不够细致。
Meanwhile, Li Yan, a professor at Wuhan University People's Hospital and director of the examination department, said the discharge criteria for the new coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan were not detailed enough.
从专业的角度来看，新冠病毒在人体内的扩散，一来是肺部的严重感染，第二是从消化道这个角度症状也非常明显。
From a professional point of view, the spread of the new crown virus in the human body, on the one hand, is a serious lung infection, and second, from the perspective of the digestive tract symptoms is also very obvious.
因此新冠病患出院之前，最好是对 4 类样本进行采集检测，包括鼻咽、痰液、口咽、肛试子等样本进行检测。
Therefore, before discharge from hospital, it is best to collect and test 4 types of samples, including nasopharynx, sputum, oral pharynx and anal examination.
如果 4 类样本检测都是阴性，那复检出阳性的可能性就会很小。
If all four samples tested were negative, the likelihood of retesting positive would be low.
图｜国家卫健委新冠肺炎诊疗方案更新解读（来源：国家卫健委官网）3 月 4 日，国家卫卫健委发布了《新型冠状病毒肺炎诊疗方案（试行第七版）》，其中提到对样本采集进行了些许细化，不过目前来看，主要还是以呼吸道标本的核酸检测为主。
2007-9-25 21: 38: 00 New Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Program (Trial Version 7), released March 4 by the National Health Protection Commission, said the sample collection was slightly refined, but so far it has been dominated by nucleic acid testing in respiratory specimens.
图｜新冠病毒的模拟蛋白（来源：bioRxiv）治愈患者一定要严出可以明确的是，核酸检测本身的局限性和层出不断的 “假阴性” 问题，是目前迫切需要弥补的检疫环节漏洞，与此同时，在春季高发、症状与新冠相似的其他呼吸道疾病，给医院疫情防控和患者分流管理带来更多压力。
Be sure to make sure that the limitations of nucleic acid testing and the ever-increasing problem of false negativity are the most pressing quarantine loopholes that need to be filled, while the high incidence of other respiratory diseases in spring, with symptoms similar to the new crown, places additional pressure on hospital disease control and patient diversion management.
李艳表示，现在有一种方式是加入免疫球蛋白 M（IgM）和免疫球蛋白 G（IgG）抗体检测，血清 IgM 和 IgG 联合检测可作为新型冠状病毒感染的有效筛查和诊断指标，与核酸检测假阴性形成有效互补。
One way, Li said, is to add immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, which could serve as effective screening and diagnostic indicators for new coronavirus infections, effectively complementing false-negative nucleic acid tests.
而抗原抗体血清学检测的标本来源于外周血、血清或血浆标本，采集和保存简单易行，抗体在血清标本中的稳定性也很好，从而提高了检测的临床敏感度。
The antigen antibody serology test sample comes from the peripheral blood, serum or plasma samples, the collection and preservation is simple, the antibody in the serum sample is also very stable, thus improving the clinical sensitivity of the test.
图｜IgM 和 IgG 抗体反应的常规发展规律（来源：网络）通常而言，病毒感染机体后，免疫系统对病毒进行免疫防御并产生特异性抗体。
Usually, when a virus infects the body, the immune system protects against the virus and produces specific antibodies.
其中特异性 IgM 抗体是机体感染后早期产生的抗体，可提示现行感染或新近感染，IgG 抗体是再次免疫应答产生的主要抗体，提示病情进入恢复期或存在既往感染。
The specific IgM antibody is an antibody produced in the early stage after infection. IgG antibody is the main antibody produced by reimmune response, indicating the recovery period or the existence of prior infection.
因此 IgM 和 IgG 抗体联合检测不仅可以对感染性疾病进行早期诊断，而且有助于对机体感染阶段进行评估。
Therefore, IgM and IgG antibody detection can not only make early diagnosis of infectious diseases, but also help to evaluate the stage of infection.
武汉大学人民医院检验科曾将 284 例研究对象 IgM 和 IgG 抗体检测结果和核酸检测结果进行比较，其中 19 例具有 COVID-19 临床症状及 CT 影像学特征但核酸检测阴性的患者，通过血清学检测发现，IgM 抗体呈阳性反应 16 例（84.21%），IgG 抗体呈阳性反应 18 例（94.74%）。
The laboratory department of the People's Hospital of Wuhan University compared the results of IgM and IgG antibody detection with nucleic acid test results in 284 cases, 19 patients with clinical symptoms of COVID-19 and CT imaging features but negative nucleic acid test found 16 cases (84.21%) positive with IgG antibody (94.74%).
据悉，在前述方舱医院接到的紧急通知中，目前已要求对所有在舱拟出院病友抽血加做病毒抗体Ig-M与Ig-G的检查。
It is reported that in the aforementioned emergency notice to the cabin hospital, all in-flight hospital patients have now been requested to add the virus antibody Ig-M and Ig-G examination.
图｜NTS 与 qPCR 检测方法对比（来源：武汉大学）此外，李艳还提到另一种检测方式：纳米孔靶向测序的检测方法（NTS）。
+ yeg NTS + QPCR: Compare the detection method with qPCR (source: Wuhan University), Li Yan also mentioned another method of detection: Nano-hole targeting sequencing (NTS).
因为目前的 qPCR 方法仅针对病毒基因组上 2-3 个位点进行检测分析，只覆盖 < 0.5% 病毒基因组，而 NTS 则可以扩大覆盖病毒基因组上毒力相关的重要基因，武大团队的一项临床试验显示，NTS 比 qPCR 的阳性检出率能提升 43.8%，而且可以区分新冠和其他常见呼吸道病毒，并同步检测在病毒传播期间与毒力相关的基因是否发生了突变。
Because the current QPCR method detects only 2-3 sites on the virus genome, covering only Rat & ltd; 0.5% viral genomes, a NTS clinical trial showed a 43.8% increase in NTS coverage of virulence-related genes in the viral genome, and differentiating between new canopy and other common respiratory viruses and synchronizing for mutations in virulence-related genes during viral transmission.
李艳表示，回顾国内这次新冠疫情防控，第一步已经基本走完了，就是迅速诊断并分离开正常人和病毒携带者；第二步国家迅速组织力量对危急重病人的集中救治以及轻症患者的隔离救治。
Li Yan said that in retrospect, the first step in the prevention and control of the new crown was basically gone, namely the rapid diagnosis and departure of normal people and carriers of the virus.
现在走到第三步了，这步的关键就是对患者彻底治愈的评估，怎么才能叫“治愈”？李艳认为，要摸索出人体针对新冠病毒的抗体曲线是怎么生长起来，然后如何降下去的。
Now at the third step, the key is an assessment of the patient's complete cure, how to call it a cure? Li Yan thinks it is important to figure out how the body's antibody curve against the new crown virus grows and then falls.
就目前来还是没有规律的，新冠病毒非常狡猾，它没有非常清晰的生长曲线，许多新冠肺炎患者的临床表现形式也不一样。
Up to now, the new crown virus is very cunning, it does not have a very clear growth curve, and many patients with New Crown Pneumonia have different clinical manifestations.
接下来还需要通过更多的试验，把数据结果提供给临床，探索新冠病毒的更多特征。
More trials are needed to make the data available clinically to explore more features of the new crown virus.
与复阳现象相比，李艳同样担忧医院各科室复工的问题，尤其是在新冠肺炎的一些定点医院，还有很多其他疾病的患者要进医院，要做手术或治疗，像这样的情况，对于入院的病人需要进行排查。
Compared with the Fuyang phenomenon, Li Yan also worried about the hospital departments to return to work, especially in some of the designated hospitals, there are many other diseases patients have to be admitted to hospitals, surgery or treatment, such as the case of patients need to be screened.
而医护人员也几乎全部要到岗，要去救治病人，医护人员的健康状态也需要严格排查，他们每天都要接触更多的各类病人，医院内的交叉感染风险依旧很大。
And the health care workers almost all to the post, to treat patients, health-care personnel need to be strictly checked, they have to deal with more and more patients every day, the risk of cross-infection within the hospital remains high.
“仗打到现在这个样子，我觉得基本上是得到控制了。
"I think it's basically under control now," he said.
控制了以后，我们的希望是不要再发生暴发，比如说交叉感染，二次传染扩散，所以说防控中后期阶段，我们更多的建议是医院不要轻易流出病人，新冠治愈者一定要严出。
Once under control, our hope is not to erupt again, say, cross-infection, secondary transmission, so in the latter stages of prevention and control, our more general advice is that hospitals should not flow out of patients easily, and that those with new crowns should be strict.
”李艳说。
