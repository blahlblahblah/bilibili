澎湃新闻记者 陈斯斯 陈伊萍 栾晓娜从1月20日上海确诊首例新冠肺炎患者以来，上海抗疫战即将满月。
Pang journalist Chen Yipinglana has been battling a full moon in Shanghai since she confirmed her first case of pneumonia in Shanghai on January 20.
而近一个月来，截至2月17日上午，确诊的331例患者中已有161人出院（包括4名儿童）。
In the past month, 161 patients (including four children) out of 331 confirmed cases had been discharged as of the morning of February 17.
治愈出院率近50%，上海是如何实现的？在确诊患者的治疗过程中，上海有没有特别的诊疗方案？上海市派驻市公卫中心高级专家组成员、复旦大学附属中山医院呼吸科主任医师朱蕾表示，上海现在确实有一些经验，也慢慢地通过各种渠道有所反映，但是系统、完整的经验或诊疗方案，目前还在做这项工作，近期应该会有一个共识。
In the course of diagnosing the patient's treatment, Shanghai has appointed Zhu Lei, a senior expert member of the Municipal Public Health Center and head of the respiratory department of Fudan University's Zhongshan Hospital.
“目前来看，新冠肺炎的治疗还没有特效药，尽管有些药可能有作用，但还没有证明哪种药有确切作用。
"At the moment, there is no specific cure for pneumonia, and although some drugs may be useful, there is no evidence of what exactly works.
”朱蕾强调，上海诊疗的核心，是综合治疗。
Zhu stressed that the core of treatment in Shanghai is comprehensive treatment.
“如何让轻症患者的免疫功能更好地恢复，让重症患者的病情避免加重，并通过综合治疗尽快好转。
"How to make the immune function of patients with mild illness better recovery, so that serious patients to avoid aggravation, and through comprehensive treatment as soon as possible improve.
”上海市公共卫生临床中心医务部主任、感染与免疫科主任医师沈银忠在接受澎湃新闻（www.thepaper.cn）记者采访时表示，上海集合了重症医学科、感染科、呼吸科、心内科、营养科、心理科专家等人员的综合力量，真正运用了多学科诊疗的模式，为每个患者提供个性化的诊疗服务，再加上运用临床与科研相互结合的方法，在治疗过程中不断优化治疗方案。
Shen Yinzhong, director of the department of medicine and director of infection and immunology at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre, said in an interview with reporters at theepaper.cn that Shanghai had assembled a comprehensive force of specialists in intensive medicine, infectionology, respiration, cardiology, nutrition and psychology.
前瞻性思维沈银忠指出，面对传染性疾病，前瞻性的思维非常重要，这就意味着在疫情出现前，要做好相应的培训及准备工作，找到如何应对的办法。
Forward-looking thinking Shen Yinzhong pointed out that forward-looking thinking is very important in the face of infectious diseases, which means training and preparation before an epidemic occurs and finding ways to deal with it.
早在1月15日，上海还未报告新冠肺炎确诊病例时，为了切实做好防控工作，沈银忠就在医院举办了防治培训，对新型冠状病毒感染的概念、流行特征、临床特点、诊治以及医院感染预防等进行了系统介绍，强调了早期识别和科学防控的重要性。
As early as January 15, Shanghai has not reported the confirmed cases of New Crown Pneumonia, in order to effectively do a good job of prevention and control, Shen Yinzhong held a hospital training on the new coronavirus infection concept, epidemic characteristics, clinical characteristics, diagnosis and treatment, and hospital infection prevention, emphasizing the importance of early identification and scientific control.
而当1月20日上海报告首例确诊病例时，医院已经具备了一套完善的救治隔离体系，医护人员对这一疾病的防护和诊疗工作已有了深入的了解。
By the time the first confirmed case was reported in Shanghai on January 20, the hospital already had a comprehensive system of treatment and isolation, and health-care workers had a thorough understanding of the prevention and treatment of the disease.
沈银忠还表示，上海针对新冠肺炎患者采取集中救治的方式，将上海公卫中心和复旦大学附属儿科医院作为两家定点医疗机构，分别救治成人和儿童患者，这两家医院都为三甲医院，具有先进的医疗技术水平以及强大的专家技术力量，有完善的硬件条件，如负压病房以及ECOM设备等。
Shen Yinzhong also said the Shanghai Public Health Center and Fudan University Pediatric Hospital are two designated medical institutions for adults and children respectively. Both hospitals are triple-A hospitals with advanced medical technology and strong expert technical force, as well as perfect hardware conditions such as negative pressure ward and ECOM equipment.
“一人一策”个体化治疗沈银忠说，同时，上海真正运用了多学科诊疗的模式，集合了上海重症医学科、感染科、呼吸科、心内科、营养科、心理科专家以及后勤管理人员的综合力量，践行“一站式”综合服务理念，为每个患者提供个性化的诊疗服务，这在其他地方可能是很难做到的。
At the same time, Shanghai is really using a multidisciplinary approach, combining the strengths of Shanghai's intensive care, infection, respiration, cardiology, nutrition, psychology and logistics managers to implement the 'one-stop' concept of integrated services, which can be difficult to achieve elsewhere.
“由于新冠肺炎是一种新出现的传染病，其诊疗方法都是未知的，我们采取了临床与科研相互结合的方法，在治疗过程中不断优化治疗方案。
"Since new crown pneumonia is a newly emerging infectious disease and its diagnosis and treatment are unknown, we have adopted a clinical and scientific approach to optimize the treatment regimen over time.
”沈银忠表示，带着科研的思维做临床工作非常重要，而针对患者采取“一人一策”这种个体化治疗模式也很重要，“我们在临床上会观察一些药物的疗效，针对一些优化诊疗方案的新技术、新疗法，我们会按照相关要求让其尽快进入伦理审批程序，从而在临床上尽快开展。
Shen said it was important to think about clinical work with scientific research, and that an individualized treatment model of "one person, one policy" was also important. "We will observe the effects of some drugs clinically, and we will introduce ethical approval procedures for new treatments as soon as possible to enable clinical trials," Shen said.
”他举例说，例如针对激素使用问题，现在也在临床不断摸索研究，用事实说话，每天调整诊疗方案，严密观察和动态监测患者病情变化，客观评估激素在治疗新冠肺炎的疗效和安全性，根据研究结果再来不断优化治疗方案。
He said, for example, that hormonal use is now being explored clinically, using facts to talk, adjusting treatment protocols every day, closely observing and dynamically monitoring patient changes, objectively assessing the efficacy and safety of hormones in the treatment of new crown pneumonia, and optimizing treatment regimens based on the results.
引进新的技术手段沈银忠表示，在此次确诊患者的治疗过程中，始终以患者需求为导向，引进了一些新的技术手段，如二代测序技术，“有些患者出现合并感染症状，但我们不知道属于哪种感染，而通过这种基因检测技术，我们就能对患者的病情有更加深入地了解，可以针对性地开展治疗”。
Shen Yinzhong, a new technical tool introduced, said that in the course of this diagnosis, new techniques have been introduced, such as second-generation sequencing technology. "Some patients show symptoms of co-infection, but we don't know what kind of infection they belong to.
另外，他提到，还有一种血药浓度检测技术，也于2月16日正式开展。
In addition, he mentioned that there was also a blood concentration test technology, which was officially launched on 16 February.
“人体对药物的代谢反应是不同的，相同剂量的同一种药物，在不同患者体内的浓度也是不同的，通过这种检测技术，我们可以知道某些抗感染药物如万古霉素，在患者体内的代谢快慢、浓度等等，根据血药浓度，我们可以有针对性地调整剂量，使得治疗更具有针对性和有效性。
"Metabolism is different in the body, and the same drug in the same dose has different concentrations in different patients. With this technique, we can know that certain anti-infective drugs, such as vancomycin, metabolize fast, concentrate and so on in the body.
”此外，沈银忠强调说，传染性疾病防控的国际化交流与讨论必不可少，上海市公共卫生临床中心是WHO合作中心，以往就一直开展国际化合作与交流。
In addition, Shen stressed that international exchanges and discussions on the prevention and control of infectious diseases were essential and that the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre, a WHO collaborating centre, had been carrying out international cooperation and exchanges in the past.
而前不久，他也作为中国唯一一名临床专家参加WHO举办的“科研路线图：新型冠状病毒全球研究与创新论坛”，每周至少一次他会与韩国、美国等来自世界各国的专家，开展电话或视频会议，共同商讨诊疗方案，就在2月14日，他还在与WHO视频会议讨论重症患者的诊疗。
He recently joined the WHO's "Roadmap for Research: A Global Research and Innovation Forum on Coronavirus New Coronavirus," which he held at least once a week by telephone or videoconference with experts from South Korea and the United States.
“针对新的传染病的出现，我们会再不断地调整诊疗方案，世界卫生组织的方案一直在更新，而国内的诊疗方案也更新到了第五版，随着我们对这一疾病的认识加深，随着临床观察与探索，我相信我们会发现越来越多有效的诊疗办法，也会尽最大努力去保障好每一位患者的治疗。
The World Health Organization's programme is constantly being updated, and the in-country treatment programme has been updated to the fifth edition. As we become more aware of the disease, I am confident that with clinical observation and exploration, we will find more and more effective methods of diagnosis and treatment and will do our best to safeguard the treatment of every patient.
”沈银忠说道。
