深度和角度——这就是我们能做的。
Depth and angle - that's what we can do.

荷兰人平时看起来甚至有些淡然，不像南欧人那么热情浪漫。
The Dutch usually look a bit cool, not as romantic as the people of southern Europe.
但到了需要帮助别人的时候， 一般都会尽力而为，不带附加条件。
But when it comes to helping others, they generally do their best, with no strings attached.
文 |王巧丽正视新冠病毒的第一天晚上7点钟， 荷兰人守在电视机前， 等着首相马克·吕特讲话。
At 7 p.m., the Dutchman stood in front of the television set, waiting for Prime Minister Mark Rutte to speak.
1700万人口的国家，1413例感染 ，24例死亡。
In a country of 17 million people, there were 1,413 infections and 24 deaths.
医疗物资紧张、谣言四起，一向以体质好、心大闻名的“橙色军团”也陷入困惑与担忧之中。
Medical supplies are tight, rumors are rife, and the Orange Corps, which is known for its good health and heart, is also confused and worried.
小姑玛丽安站在门外， 和我先生隔着一米说话， 讨论婆婆的病情。
Marian, the sister-in-law, stood outside the door and spoke to my husband one metre apart about her mother-in-law's illness.
婆婆今年88岁， 这几年身体状况不好，一直住在安养院。
Her mother-in-law, 88, has been in a nursing home for several years because of her poor health.
从上个月开始， 她开始发烧、病情加重， 意识模糊。
Since last month, she has had a fever, increased illness and blurred consciousness.
小姑去看她， 婆婆已经认不出照料她最多、她最为之骄傲的大女儿。
The sister-in-law went to see her, and her mother-in-law could not recognize her eldest daughter, who cared most for her.
小姑和先生的难题是：如果婆婆的状况在荷兰新冠肺炎疫情中进一步恶化，她还会得到必要的救助吗？安养院每次只让一名家人定时进去探望， 万一婆婆发生不测、家人正好不在怎么办？少女时代的婆婆汽车玻璃后面的婆婆，摄于半年前3月16日，这个国家正视新冠病毒的第一天。
If her mother-in-law's situation deteriorates further with the Dutch New Crown Pneumonia, will she receive the necessary help? Only one family member is allowed in regularly at a time, what if something happens to the mother-in-law and her family?
从周一开始，学校关闭、餐馆和咖啡馆关停。
Starting Monday, schools were closed, as were restaurants and cafes.
政府建议人们减少出行，尽量呆在家里。
The government advises people to travel less and stay at home as much as possible.
在此之前，100人以上的聚会被叫停， 电影院关闭。
Earlier, more than 100 people were stopped at parties and cinemas were closed.
我制片并导演的电影纪录片《乐僧》（罗文为联合导演），在荷兰最大的艺术院线卢米埃尔电影院排在了3月17号。
I made and directed the documentary film Monk (co-directed by Rowan), which was listed on March 17 at the Lumiere Cinema, the largest art studio in the Netherlands.
就在上映前两天，政府决定关停所有超过百人聚会场所，这部片子因为被迫延期而参与了历史。
Just two days before its release, the government decided to shut down all more than a hundred party venues, and the film had become a part of history because it had to be postponed.
由于疫情，卢米埃尔电影院被迫延迟了《乐僧》的放映与原定17日晚的导演对话“我没有容易接受的消息给大家。
Because of the outbreak, the Lumiere Cinema was forced to postpone the screening of Le Monk from the scheduled dialogue with the director on the evening of the 17th.
荷兰是一个开放国家。
The Netherlands is an open country.
病毒浪潮一样奔涌，不会放过荷兰。
Like a wave of viruses, the Dutch will not be spared.
” 马克·吕特说， 对三种可能出现的情形与政府的选择做了阐释。
Mark Rutte said there were three possible scenarios and government choices.
第一种可能是最大限度控制病毒传播的同时，逐步建立群体免疫力。
The first possibility is to minimize the spread of the virus while gradually building group immunity.
这种方式下，60%-70%的国民将感染，需要用几个月的时间。
In this way, 60 to 70 per cent of the population will be infected and will take several months.
第二种可能是听任病毒传播， 造成医疗系统过载， 老年人与其他高危人群将无法得到帮助。
A second possibility is to allow the virus to spread, overloading health systems and leaving older persons and other high-risk groups without help.
第三种选择是拼命战胜病毒， 下死命令锁国。
The third option is to fight the virus and lock the country.
这听起来非常有吸引力，这样会导致国家陷于瘫痪， 数月乃至超过一年难以恢复。
That sounds appealing, and it could paralyze the country for months or more.
更多的公司将倒闭， 更多的人将失业。
More companies will go out of business and more people will lose their jobs.
有控制地、逐步建立群体免疫力，这是荷兰政府的选择。
Controlled and progressive development of group immunity is the choice of the Dutch government.
荷兰站在了德、法、英同一条战线，而没有像意大利和西班牙一样更激进。
The Netherlands is on the same front as Germany, France, and Britain, not as radical as Italy or Spain.
作为一个有长期理性主义传统的国家，做出这样的选择一点没让人惊讶。
As a country with a long tradition of rationalism, it is not surprising that such a choice has been made.
把防御系统与战斗（疗救）系统分开，实际上是和欧洲长期的分级医疗思维一致的。
The separation of the defense system from the combat (healing) system is, in fact, consistent with Europe's long-standing hierarchical medical thinking.
荷兰政府选择了严控与群体免疫相结合的方式，以避免医疗系统过载全世界人民都知道，在荷兰， 如果你只是生病感冒， 根本去不了医院。
The Dutch government has opted for a combination of strict controls and mass immunization to avoid overloading the health-care system. People all over the world know that if you're just sick with a cold, you can't go to a hospital at all.
轻症患者只能去看家庭医生，去了基本是白去， 大概率还是让你空手回家休息。
Minor patients can only go to see a family doctor, go to basically go for nothing, the probability or let you go home empty-handed rest.
医生对病情轻重的判断标准， 和我们常规的认知也不一样。
The doctor's judgment of the severity of the illness is not the same as our general knowledge.
记得我生老大时， 分娩后当天下午就回家了。
I remember going home the afternoon after the birth when I was the oldest child.
第二天出现了产后发烧，身体直打颤。
The next day there was postpartum fever and the body trembled.
先生焦虑万分给医院打电话。
Mr. A phoned the hospital with anxiety.
医院派了一名男医生和一名实习医生来到家里， 做了仔细的检查后， 建议我用冰块敷头， 让先生去商店给我买两支冰淇淋。
The hospital sent a male doctor and an intern to the house. After careful examination, I was advised to apply ice cubes to the shop and ask my husband to buy me two ice creams.
我想哭又想笑， 这是多么原始的方法啊！后来， 拗不过先生的坚持， 我忍痛吃了一只蛋筒冰淇淋，高温慢慢下降。
I want to cry and laugh, this is such a primitive way ah! Later, despite the insistence of my husband, I suffered a cone ice cream, the heat slowly declined.
用物理降温而不是药物降温， 经常是荷兰医生的第一选择。
It is often the Dutch doctor's first choice to cool down physically rather than medicinally.
按我的理解，中国与欧洲在对抗疫情的态度上，就像在球场上的不同打法。
As I understand it, the attitude of China and Europe in fighting the epidemic is like playing differently on the pitch.
中国采取了对病毒进攻性的打法。
China has taken an aggressive approach to the virus.
欧洲则采用全面防守打法，尽管开局时有些蒙，并不代表不使劲踢。
Europe uses a full-back approach, although it was a bit dull at the start, but it didn't mean it didn't kick hard.
包括被中国报纸严辞批评的瑞典， 采取的也是“全面防守”（Total Defence）策略， 寄希望于低风险人群自愈， 为风险人群腾出资源和空间。
Sweden, which has been harshly criticized by Chinese newspapers, has also adopted a "Total Defense" strategy, hoping that low-risk groups will heal themselves, freeing up resources and space for those at risk.
“假如末日明天到来， 今天我照样种自己的苹果树。
If the end comes tomorrow, I will plant my own apple-tree to-day.
”2019年9月， 荷兰林堡省电视一台的记者为我制作专题纪录片时，问起对世界不确定性的看法， 我这么回答。
In September 2019, when a reporter from Limburg, the Netherlands, made a feature documentary for me, I asked what I thought of the uncertainty of the world, I said.
这句已经忘记了出处的话， 一直是我的信念之一。
This has forgotten the origin of the words, has always been one of my beliefs.
半年之间， 中美贸易战边谈边打，折腾了数年的英国终于脱欧，冠状病毒全球暴发， 美股一周熔断两次。
Half a year later, China and the US fought a trade war, and after years of bickering, the United Kingdom finally left the European Union, a global outbreak of coronavirus, and US stocks melted twice a week.
一件件不确定事件发生，规模之大、频率之高， 让人难以看清我们所处的时代与自身处境的拼图。
Uncertain events occur on a scale and frequency that make it difficult to see the jigsaw puzzle of our times and circumstances.
从更长的时间轴上，作为一个旅居海外的前媒体人，17年前我经历了SARS， 和同事们并肩奋战，并在《新民周刊》做了《“SARS”呼唤透明行政》的封面报道。
From the longer timeline, as a former media expatriate, I experienced SARS 17 years ago, working side by side with my colleagues and covering the issue of "SARS Call for Transparent Administration" in Xinmin Weekly.
即使放到今天，那组报道仍然经得起检验。
Even today, the group of reports can stand the test.
17年后，作为一个纪录片与舞台节目导演， 我在荷兰马斯特里赫特响应政府“居家隔离”的政令，再次用自己的方式经历了这场从星星之火燎原的疫情。
Seventeen years later, as a documentary and stage director, I was in Maastricht, the Netherlands, in response to the government's "home quarantine" order, and once again experienced the epidemic in my own way.
关键时刻的社会互助我的一个德国朋友， 这么写他邻居为“禁足”做的准备：贝尓恩特78岁，家住德国北威州，一儿一女加上一个孙子。
Social Solidarity at a Critical Moment A German friend of mine wrote about his neighbor's preparation for a "no foot" ban: Bernd, 78, lives in northern Germany, has a son and a daughter plus a grandson.
吃过早饭后，老人开始计划他防疫工作的第一步：如果我和我的老伴要隔离两周，我们绝对必需的吃穿住用都有哪些，哪些已有，哪些尚需采购，如要采购，什么店什么时间人最少，感染几率最小，什么店可以网购，大致需要多少时间。
After breakfast, the old man began to plan the first step in his epidemic prevention work: if my wife and I were to be isolated for two weeks, we would have absolutely everything we needed to eat, what we had, what we needed to buy, what shops had the least time to buy, which shops had the least number of people, what shops could buy online and how long it would take.
必备药品需多少，有多少接近过期，需要更新；离家最近的急诊室设备如何，如果不能接诊，下一个点在什么地方，驱车前往需要多少时间……一切计划落实完毕之后，开始为女儿和女婿计划：女儿在柏林，公交密集，为降低感染几率，替代出行的方式都有哪些，哪些公司在柏林专事在线会议的举办，能否建议女儿所在公司实行远程办公，万一不行，谁能开假条……一切计划周密之后，开始考察儿子一家都需要什么，该做哪些应急预案，如何落实……贝尓恩特一边哼着小曲儿，抿着咖啡，一边把自己的部署写成一张张“必办清单”，上附联络人地址电话……正干得起劲，女婿来电话说口罩买不到了，贝尓恩特嘿嘿一笑“两周前我就下了单，今天下午到。
How many drugs are needed, how many are nearing expiration, need updating, what is the nearest emergency room equipment, where is the next point if you can't get it, what's the next point, how much time to drive...
我给你们发5个过去，先用着……”这种强大的个人事务组织能力， 在德国和荷兰人中很常见。
I'm sending you five of them, starting with... "This powerful personal-affairs organizing ability is common in Germany and the Dutch.
婆婆身体还好的时候， 走到哪里都带着一个记事本，上面总写得密密麻麻的“购物清单”，“待办事项”“未办事项”等。
When her mother-in-law is fine, she carries a notepad with her wherever she goes, with her "shopping list," "to-do list" and "unfinished business."
她管理家庭像图书管理员管书一样条目细分， 我下一辈子也学不来， 索性就直接放弃了。
She manages the family as a librarian book entry subdivision, I will never learn next life, simply give up.
我们的邻居们很早就为街上的几十户人家建立了一个WHATSAPP大群。
Our neighbors built a large WHATSAPP group early on for dozens of families on the street.
人群中谁家有危重病人、谁家有青壮年，都统计得一清二楚。
Who in the crowd is critically ill and whose family is young and old is well documented.
谁可能最需要帮助， 谁在哪一天的哪个具体时刻能够提供帮助。
Who may need help the most, and who can help on which day and at what specific moment.
我们家的邮箱里， 也收到了当地大学生塞进来、愿意提供无偿帮助的纸条。
In our family's mailbox, also received the local university student to cram in, is willing to provide the free help the note.
疫情之前的小城马斯特里赫特， 我们生活的地方荷兰人平时看起来甚至有些淡然，不像南欧人那么热情浪漫，但到了需要帮助别人的时候，一般都会尽力而为，不带附加条件。
In Maastricht, our pre-epidemic town, the Dutch, where we live, seem to be even less romantic than those in southern Europe, but when it comes to helping others, they generally do their best, without strings attached.
有一次我伤了胳膊， 邻居知道后， 悄悄地把我家门前的草坪整理了。
When I hurt my arm once, the neighbor knew it and quietly tidied up the lawn in front of my house.
担心我饿瘦，其他荷兰同事也送汤、送自己做的蛋糕。
Fearing that I was hungry and thin, other Dutch colleagues gave me soup and cakes of their own.
3月17日全天， 已经有数千人报名做医疗志愿者， 包括已经退休的医护人员和受过医护培训但在从事其他工作的人员、医学院学生等。
On March 17, thousands of people signed up as medical volunteers, including retired health care workers and those with medical training but working in other jobs, medical students, etc.
荷兰的幼儿园和学校，没有彻底关闭。
Kindergartens and schools in the Netherlands have not been completely closed.
如果一个家庭中有两人同时从事当下急需的工作，如医疗、物流等，学校仍然接收他们的孩子上学，并采取分组方法尽最大努力保证孩子健康。
If two members of a family are doing much-needed work at the same time, such as medical care and logistics, the school still accepts their children to school and uses the cluster approach to do its utmost to ensure the health of the children.
回想两个月前， 我从北京飞回阿姆斯特丹。
I remember flying back to Amsterdam from Beijing two months ago.
看着国内的消息， 每天都是难过、担心。
Looking at the news at home, every day is sad, worried.
“国家有难， 匹夫有责”， 作为一个不在现场的人， 开始时我被深深的无力感吞噬者。
"The country is in trouble, the husband is responsible", as an absent person, I was initially deeply powerless devoured.
后来看到国内“一方有难八方支援”的壮举， 和无数个人的奉献与牺牲， 才有了很多信心：中国必胜。
Later I saw the feat of "one side has difficulty in support of all", and countless personal dedication and sacrifice, only then have a lot of confidence: China will win.
有强大的个体组织能力与关键时刻社会互助，对于这个国家的抗疫，我同样不悲观。
With strong individual organizational capacity and critical social solidarity, I am equally not pessimistic about the epidemic in this country.
提前安排的临终弥撒看完首相的讲话，小姑玛丽安和我先生达成了一致意见：为婆婆尽快安排一场临终弥撒。
After reading the Prime Minister's speech at the prearranged mass, Marian and my husband agreed to arrange a dying mass for her mother-in-law as soon as possible.
婆婆一生克勤克俭，经历了第二次世界大战，养育了五个孩子。
My mother-in-law lived a hard life, lived through World War II and raised five children.
从内战中贵族家的千金大小姐，变成了一个处处要留心家常用度、缝缝补补锅碗瓢盆的家庭妇女， 她为之骄傲，但也有不甘。
She was proud, but unwilling, to be a housewife, from the aristocracy of the Civil War, to a housewife who was always watchful, mending, mending, and mending pots and pans.
婆婆的少年（前排中间的小女孩）八十岁的时候， 她还想把自己大学经济系的课程读完， 还想着学开车、看一看世界， 但这些都只能归于梦想。
By the time she was eighty years old, she wanted to finish her college economics course and learn how to drive and see the world, but that was only a dream.
她很快开始健忘，生活逐渐不能自理。
She soon became forgetful, and her life began to fail her.
她一生是虔诚的天主教徒。
She was a devout Catholic all her life.
如果在牧师做临终弥撒之前病逝，对她和家人， 都难以接受。
If the priest dies before the last mass, it is difficult for her and her family to accept.
疫情的发展，把安养院的老人们变成了易感人群。
The spread of the epidemic has turned the elderly in nursing homes into susceptible groups.
每次只能由一个人探视， 包括牧师。
Only one person can visit at a time, including the pastor.
这样， 当牧师用戴着手套的手握住她瘦弱的手， 用戴着口罩的口对她说“天主保佑， 你将在另外的世界因为善良与奉献得到赏赐”时， 没有一个家人能够在她身边。
Thus, when the minister took her emaciated hand in his gloved hand and said to her in the mouth of her mask, "God bless you, you will be rewarded for kindness and devotion in another world," no family member can be with her.
也许她还能有想说而无力说出的话， 也许她想看每一个人， 传达这最后的爱意与不舍。
Perhaps she can also want to say but powerless to say, perhaps she would like to see everyone, to convey this last love and give up.
但在2020年3月，因为新冠肺炎疫情， 一切都不一样了……王巧丽 :新盐传媒创始人，纪录电影与舞台导演。
But in March 2020, with the outbreak of new crown pneumonia, everything is different... Wang Qiaoli: Founder of New Salt Media, a documentary film and stage director.
