判断疫情是否会反复，应关注密切接触者追踪系数的变化。
To judge whether the epidemic will be repeated, we should pay attention to the change of tracing coefficient of close contacts.
湖北该指标近三日为13，即出现一例追踪13人；非湖北地区近三日追踪比已达到150左右，这样的追踪系数很难出现反扑情况，尤其湖北之外文 | 《财经》数据研究员徐进 图 |《财经》视觉中心 编辑 |谢丽容一、累计确诊病例：全国总病例数有望控制在8万例左右截至2月24日24:00，全国累计报告确诊新冠肺炎病例77658例。
In Hubei province, where the tracking ratio has reached about 150 in the past three days, it is difficult to find a backlash, especially when compared with the last three days.
以下为分区趋势图。
The following is the zoning trend chart.
图1.1让我们和“死神”赛跑！图1.2武汉以外地区的趋势线平顶已经清晰，目前可以看出：国内非湖北地区累计病例将停留在13000例以内，湖北非武汉地区将在19000例以内，武汉将在48000例左右。
Figure 1.2 Trend lines outside Wuhan have been clearly indicated, with a cumulative total of 13,000 cases in non-Hubei areas, 19,000 in Hubei Province and 48,000 in Wuhan.
最主要的变数是，这个新冠肺炎究竟是像SARS一样不留长尾，还是会如指数函数所示的拖出一条长长的尾巴（最近有专家有此担心）？亦或介于两者之间？目前从非湖北地区数据看很可能不会拖出一条长尾，即便有，也会是很细的一条。
The main variable is whether the new pneumonia has a long tail, like SARS, or a long tail, as suggested by the exponential function (as some experts have recently feared), or somewhere in between? At present, the non-Hubei data are unlikely to produce a long tail, or even a very fine one, if any.
二、新增病例：非湖北地区降至个位数，湖北续降，武汉波动图2国内非湖北地区24日新增病例9例，自疫情暴发以来首次降至个位数。
2. New cases: non-Hubei region fell to single digits, Hubei continued to fall, Wuhan fluctuation chart 2 China's non-Hubei region 24 new cases 9 cases, since the outbreak of the first time since the outbreak fell to single digits.
零新增省市24个，占4/5。
There were 24 new provinces and municipalities, accounting for 4 / 5.
北京在连续两日零新增之后，又出现1例。
After two consecutive days of zero new Beijing, there was another case.
图3湖北非武汉地区继续下降，按此趋势可预测3月1日前后出现零新增。
Fig. 3 Hubei non-Wuhan area continues to decline, according to this trend can be predicted around March 1 appear zero new.
图4武汉略显波动，但总体维持在波动向下趋势区间。
Fig. 4 Wuhan shows slight fluctuation, but overall maintains a downward trend range of fluctuation.
三、确诊病例增长率：武汉以外地区增速进一步“趋零”，武汉出现反弹但并未改变波动下降趋势图5国内非湖北地区增长率降至0.07%以内。
The rate of increase of confirmed cases outside Wuhan is further "zero." Wuhan has rebounded but has not changed the trend of fluctuation.
湖北非武汉地区降至0.20%，武汉出现波动，但并未改变波动下降趋势。
Hubei non-Wuhan region fell to 0.20%, Wuhan fluctuated, but did not change the trend of fluctuation.
四、密切接触者追踪：湖北及武汉的追踪力度强势提升图6湖北该指标还在爬升，近三日追踪比为13。
Close contact tracing: Hubei and Wuhan tracking the strength of a strong increase Figure 6 Hubei this indicator is still climbing, nearly three days to track ratio of 13.
考虑到湖北，特别是武汉实行社区封闭管理，人员流动和社交活动已基本被控死，有这样的追踪比，应大体合理。
Considering the closed community management in Hubei, Wuhan in particular, the movement of people and social activities have basically been charged with death, such a tracking ratio should be generally reasonable.
而由于有较大资源优势，非湖北地区近三日追踪比已达到150左右。
Due to the advantage of large resources, the tracking ratio in non-Hubei area has reached about 150 in the past three days.
图7该存量继续下降，意味着不断释放更多医疗资源、社会人力资源和隔离空间投入到新的密切接触者追踪、隔离上。
Figure 7 shows that this stock continues to decline, meaning that more medical resources, social human resources and isolated spaces are increasingly being released into new close contacts to track and isolate.
五、疑似病例：继续下降图8继续下降，符合预期。
V. Suspected Cases: Continuing Decline Figure 8 continues to fall in line with expectations.
图9湖北在拉网排查取得成功后，已连续多日下降，印证“拉网筛查”战果。
Fig. 9 Hubei in the pull net after the success of screening, has been declining for many days, confirming the "pull screen" results.
也符合我们的预期。
And it's in line with our expectations.
六、在院治疗人数：继续成规模释放病床床位图10在院治疗人数存量下降，继续成规模释放病床床位。
In-patient treatment: continuation of the large-scale release of bed chart 10 The number of hospital treatment in the stock of decline, continue to release beds on a large scale.
推测出的“湖北确诊未入院”人数也在下降。
The number of people diagnosed as unhospitalized in Hubei Province is also decreasing.
七、病死率、治愈率图11病死率自2月上旬以来持续缓升，基本符合疫情中病死率变化正常特征。
fatality rate and cure rate Figure 11 The fatality rate has been rising slowly since early February, which is basically in line with the normal features of disease mortality in the epidemic.
但在湖北特别是武汉，也有救治措施不到位因素。
But in Hubei, Wuhan in particular, there are also factors that are not in place.
2月24日，中央应对新冠肺炎疫情工作领导小组会议特别指出武汉要落实分类收治措施，尽最大努力降低病死率。
On February 24, the meeting of the Central Leading Group for the Response to the New Crown Pneumonia epidemic highlighted the need for Wuhan to implement classified treatment measures and do its utmost to reduce the fatality rate.
图12治愈率以更快速度上升。
Fig. 12 The cure rate is increasing at a faster rate.
八、新增出院和新增确诊图13.1图13.2新增确诊病例数和新增治愈病例数剪刀差有所扩大，武汉释放更多医疗资源。
New Discharges and New Diagnosis Figure 13.1 The number of newly confirmed cases and the number of newly cured cases has widened. Wuhan has released more medical resources.
小结：国内非湖北地区新增病例趋零，湖北非武汉地区继续下降，武汉波动下降趋势未改。
Summary: New cases in non-Hubei areas of China are zero, Hubei non-Wuhan areas continue to decline, Wuhan undulating downward trend.
包括武汉在内，各地都有更多可用于隔离和救治的相关资源被释放。
Wuhan included, there are more places for the isolation and treatment of the relevant resources were released.
近日可能需要将境外和国外疫情动态纳入视野。
In recent days, it may be necessary to take into account the overseas and foreign epidemic dynamics.
