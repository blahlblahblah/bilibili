作为A股涨幅最大的“口罩概念”第一股，道恩股份近期吸引各路游资聚集炒作，股东也趁股价在高位推出减持计划。
As the biggest A-share increase in the "mask concept" the first shares, Dow recently attracted a variety of hot money speculation, shareholders also take advantage of the high launched reduction plan.
这家公司的业绩成色究竟如何，引发市场关注争议文|《财经》记者 张建锋 杨秀红编辑|陆玲随着新冠病毒疫情蔓延，口罩成为中国乃至全球公众抢购的紧缺物资，相关产业的概念股一路飙升，成为近期A股市场的宠儿，其中表现最突出的就是道恩股份（002838.SZ）。
The company's success has sparked controversy and controversy. Lu Ling, a journalist with Caijing Zhang Jianfeng Yang Xiuhong, has soared to become a favorite in the A-share market in the recent past, most notably Dow Jones shares (002838.SZ) as the new crown virus spreads and masks become a snag in China and around the world.
2020年2月3日至3月6日，道恩股份以368%的涨幅，遥遥领先紧随其后的泰达股份（000652.SZ）、搜于特（002503.SZ）148%、132%涨幅，成为A股市场所谓“口罩概念”第一股。
From February 3 to March 6, 2020, Dow Jones shares rose 368%, leading closely followed by Teda shares (000652. SZ), search (002503.SZ) 148%, 132% up, becoming the first "mask concept" in the A-share market.
但这家公司的真实业绩成色如何，日益引发争议。
But the company's true results are increasingly controversial.
“从资金进出情况来看，主力出逃、游资疯狂接盘，散户没有这么激进的风格和这么大的资金量。
"From the inflow and outflow of funds, the main escape, hot money crazy access, retail investors do not have such a radical style and so much money.
”一位在道恩股份此轮股价上涨中收益超50%的操盘手对《财经》记者表示，目前价格太高，不敢碰了，改看新基建相关公司。
A manipulator with more than 50 per cent of the rise in Dow Jones shares told Caijing that prices were too high to be touched and that companies involved in new infrastructure projects should be looked at instead.
龙虎榜交易数据显示，在近期买卖道恩股份前五名席位中，部分资金不断倒手，边买边卖，游资身影闪现其中。
Some of the top five seats in the recent Dow Jones trading show that some of the money has been sold while buying and selling, with hot money flashing in.
“公司股价是市场行为，对此不做评价。
"A company's share price is a market activity that is not evaluated.
”道恩股份一位人士对《财经》记者表示。
A person with a stake in Dow Jones told Caijing.
股价暴涨之际，道恩股份迎来了股东减持计划。
The stock price boom coincided with a shareholder reduction plan for Downs shares.
在1月份道恩股份股东伍社毛发布减持计划后，2月份公司董事长于晓宁之妻韩丽，及公司两名高管也加入拟减持行列。
Han Li, wife of Chairman Yu Xiaoning in February, and two other company executives joined the plan after Mr. Downs shareholders announced plans to reduce their holdings in January.
《财经》记者统计显示，按照3月9日每股59元收盘价计算，上述股东、高管减持股份市值合计约10.23亿元，当天道恩股份整体市值240.1亿元。
According to Caijing reporter statistics, according to March 9 closing price of 59 yuan per share, the above-mentioned shareholders, executives reduced the market value of shares of about 1.023 billion yuan, the total market value of Dow Jones shares that day 24.01 billion yuan.
上述道恩股份人士表示，股东减持是正常行为，数量并不大，目前只是有计划，什么时候减持还没确定。
Dawn shares said the reduction is normal behavior, the number is not large, only at present there are plans, when the reduction has not been determined.
相对于股价在一个多月里上涨3倍多的现状，道恩股份2019年营收同比增1倍、净利润同比增36.96%，并不让人太意外。
Given that share prices have more than tripled in more than a month, it is not surprising that Dow shares doubled year-on-year in 2019, with net profits up 36.96% year on year.
更重要的是，该公司与口罩相关的原材料--聚丙烯熔喷料，2018年收入占合并营业收入仅为13.41%。
More importantly, the company's Mask-related raw material, polypropylene spray, accounts for only 13.41% of combined revenue in 2018.
对此，道恩股份心知肚明，因此近期发公告提示：目前公司聚丙烯熔喷专用料订单增加，将对公司经营业绩产生一定的积极影响，但随着疫情得到有效控制，预计该产品未来订单会逐步减少。
Dawn shares are aware of this, so the recent announcement that the increase in the company's order for polypropylene spray will have a positive impact on the company's operating performance, but as the epidemic is effectively controlled, future orders for this product are expected to gradually decrease.
《财经》记者注意到，与口罩核心层熔喷布缺口巨大形成鲜明对比的是，熔喷布原料高熔指纤维聚丙烯国内产能比较充裕。
Caijing reporter noted that, in sharp contrast to the huge gap in the core of the mask coating, the melt-jet raw material high-melt fiber polypropylene domestic production capacity is relatively adequate.
工信部表示，聚丙烯纤维中用于口罩生产的高熔指聚丙烯纤维料2019年国内产量约90万吨，一吨可生产一次性外科口罩90万-100万副。
The ministry said domestic production of polypropylene fibre, a high-melt polypropylene fibre used in mask production, would be about 900,000 tonnes in 2019, making 900,000 to 1m disposable surgical masks per tonne.
而作为高熔指聚丙烯纤维料的原材料-聚丙烯目前供大于求，该产品期货价格虽止跌企稳有所回升，但聚丙烯主力连续合约在3月6日的收盘点数，相对于2月4日低点，涨幅仅为6.96%。
While the price of polypropylene, the raw material for high-melt polypropylene fibre, is now in excess of demand, the futures price of the product has recovered somewhat, but the main polypropylene contract closed on March 6, up only 6.96% from its low on February 4.
有机构预测，中长期来看，聚丙烯受新增产能压制未改。
Some institutions forecast that, in the medium to long term, polypropylene by new production capacity repression.
游资轮番炒作，实控人拟高额套现3月9日，在沪指收盘跌3.01%的情形下，道恩股份再度逆势涨停。
Shares in Dow Jones trading reversed a rally after the Shanghai index closed down 3.01 per cent on March 9.
自2月3日春节开市以来，道恩股份股价已从节前的11.46元/股上涨至如今的59元/股，股价涨幅高达414.83%，成为口罩概念第一股。
Since the start of the Spring Festival on February 3, Dow has risen from 11.46 yuan per share before the holiday to 59 yuan a share, up 414.83 percent, making it the first share of the mask concept.
“从盘面上看，主力资金每天在出货，但仍不影响他涨停，说明游资在疯狂的换手。
"From the disk, the main funds in the daily shipment, but still do not affect his trading, indicating that hot money in a frantic change.
”近日，股市操盘手张文（化名）对《财经》记者表示。
Zhang Wen, a stock market manipulator, told Caijing recently.
《财经》记者观察到，从资金角度看，近期道恩股份股价上涨主要源自于游资的炒作。
Caijing reporter observed that from a financial point of view, the recent Dow shares rose mainly due to hot money speculation.
自2月3日开始以来，该公司公布的龙虎榜交易数据显示，其买入前五名大多是游资。
Since the start of February 3, the company has reported that the top five most of its purchases are hot money.
且在买卖前五名席位中，有一些资金正在不断倒手，边买边卖。
And some of the top five seats are being sold while buying and selling.
以3月5日为例，当日道恩股份涨停，其买入和卖出的前五大席位中均出现了西藏东方财富证券拉萨团结路、西藏东方财富证券拉萨东环路的身影。
On March 5, for example, the first five seats in the Dow Jones trading were marked by the presence of the Tibet Oriental Wealth Securities Lhasa Solidarity Road and the East Tibet Wealth Securities Lhasa East Ring Road.
而自2月3日以来，这两家营业部身影频繁出现在龙虎榜交易数据名单中，且边买边卖。
Since February 3, the two business departments have frequently appeared on the list of dragon and tiger trade data, and sold while buying.
“我的师兄春节前就进来了，资金量不算多，他翻了一翻就离开了。
"My brother came in before the Spring Festival. The amount of money was not much, so he turned over and left.
”张文向《财经》记者介绍：“我是第二波进来的，20元左右买入，30多元出的，没吃饱就跑了。
"Zhang Wen told Caijing:" I was the second wave came in, about 20 yuan buy, more than 30 yuan out, did not have enough to run.
我选择买进是因为师兄持有这只股票，让我帮着看下，感觉还有一波，但他没拿住。
I chose to buy it because my brother owned the stock and asked me to look at it. It felt like there was another wave, but he didn't hold it.
”随着疫情的全球蔓延，口罩的稀缺程度一直居高不下。
The scarcity of masks has been high as the epidemic spreads around the world.
口罩概念股则成为资本市场的热门股。
The mask concept has become a hot stock in capital markets.

熔喷料收入占比不高，市场供应已逐渐充足被资金爆炒的道恩股份，与口罩相关的产品是聚丙烯熔喷专用料，该产品占公司收入并不高。

相对于资金对股价的痴狂，道恩股份2019年净利润虽有增长，但算不上惊艳。
Dawn's share price has grown in 2019 relative to the frenzy about equity prices, but it is not breathtaking.

Dawn shares told Caijing that the fuel is now produced mainly by the parent company, and Greater Han Dawn has a daily production capacity of about 30 tons, which is not large enough to be included in the company's statistics.
《财经》记者注意到，与口罩核心层熔喷布目前缺口巨大、价格暴涨不同的是，熔喷料市场供给较为充裕。
Caijing reporter noted, with mask core layer at present gap is huge, price skyrocketing is different, smelter market supply is more abundant.
口罩生产环节为：聚丙烯-高熔指纤维聚丙烯-熔喷布-口罩。
Mask production process is: polypropylene - high melt finger fiber polypropylene - melt spray cloth - mask.
前瞻产业研究院数据显示，国内聚丙烯供应充足，年产量在2000万吨以上，预计2020年将有超过500吨有效产能释放，实际总供给量（含国内产量及进口量）或可达2700万吨。

随着宝丰能源等企业加入，该产品供应将会进一步增加。
With the addition of Baofeng Energy and other enterprises, the supply of this product will further increase.

FuNeng Futures said increased demand supported a short-term rebound in polypropylene, but was held back in the medium to long term by the build-up of inventory and the continued release of new capacity.
