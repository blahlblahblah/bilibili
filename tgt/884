本报记者 王迎春 武汉报道刘小煊的父亲终于住进了医院，这让她稍稍松了一口气。
Our reporter Wang Yingchun Huanxuan reported that Liu Xiaoxuan's father was finally admitted to the hospital, which gave her a slight sigh of relief.
不久前，母亲被查出感染新型肺炎，父亲在照顾母亲的过程中被传染。
Not long ago, the mother was diagnosed with a new form of pneumonia and her father was infected while caring for his mother.
这种状况一度令刘小煊抓狂，不过她很快振作自己，与丈夫分工协作，全力做好父母的营养保障、医疗就诊，以及全家人的自我保护。
This situation drove Liu Xiaoxuan to distraction for a while, but she quickly picked herself up and worked with her husband on nutrition, medical care and self-protection for the whole family.
“我母亲已接近康复，在家疗养，父亲也住进医院，我的身体也一直没出问题，这说明我们的努力是有效果的。
"My mother is close to recovery, her father is in the hospital, and my health has been okay, which shows that our efforts have been effective.
”刘小煊对记者说。
"Liu Xiaoxuan told reporters.
以下文字根据采访记录。
The following text is based on interview transcripts.
不能放弃我妈是一个很要强的人，你知道武汉人的性格嘛，能自己做到的事情绝不麻烦别人，身体有点小问题不会马上去医院。
Can not give up my mother is a very strong person, you know Wuhan character, can do things by themselves do not bother others, a little physical problems will not immediately go to the hospital.
她其实身体并不好，是那种在一堆人中最容易遭（指生病）的人。
She was not really in good health, she was the kind of person most likely to get sick.
起初，妈妈就有点感冒症状，在家自己扛了4天，结果没扛住，严重了，才去医院，做了CT、查了血，被医生口头确诊为新型肺炎。
At first, mother had a cold symptoms, at home on their own for 4 days, the result did not hold, serious, just go to the hospital, made a CT, blood tests, was confirmed orally by the doctor as a new pneumonia.
这个时候，我已从新闻信息以及朋友圈了解到，武汉专门收治发热病人的各大医院早就人满了。
By this time, I have learned from the news and friends circle, Wuhan specialized in treating febrile patients of the major hospitals have been full.
就近，我们就到武汉市中心医院去看病。
Nearby, we went to Wuhan Central Hospital to see the doctor.
我妈严重的时候状况很不好，双肺感染，人完全动不了，不想动，甚至不想打针。
My mother was in a bad condition when she was serious. She had a two-lung infection. She couldn't move, she didn't want to move.
我就用轮椅推着她去。
I wheeled her along.
推过去大约20分钟，就当散步了，人在空旷的环境透透气也好。
Push past about 20 minutes, take a walk, the person in the open environment breathable as well.
因为打针排队时间特别长，6个小时、8个小时，总结出经验后，我就先自己去排队，然后估计着时间，再通知家里人把我妈送过来，这样也省得我妈遭罪，并且也是对他人负责。
After summing up the experience, I would go to the queue myself and estimate the time. Then I would inform my family that I would send my mother over, which would save my mother suffering and would also be responsible to others.
后来我爸也遭了（指感染新型肺炎），也许是在照顾我妈的过程中被感染的。
And then my dad got infected, maybe while he was taking care of my mom.
他本来就有中风病史，一开始，他只是咳嗽，并没有发烧，不过喉咙堵得慌，老是有异物感，就是咳不出来，呼吸像吹泡泡一样。
He had a history of stroke. At first, he coughed and did not have a fever, but his throat was cramped and he always felt foreign, but he coughed and breathed like a bubble.
这个时候，我最抓狂了，两个人先后感染，早上在医院为我妈排队，排了8个小时终于我妈能打上针了，医生说我爸得重新排队，我就哭着求他们，因为我爸的状态确定很严重，动不了，还要推轮椅，好在医生们最终同意给我爸打了一针。
At this point, two people got infected, lined up for my mom at the hospital for eight hours in the morning and finally got an injection. The doctor said my dad had to stand in line again.
我妈看我难，一开始也不想去医院，我一再坚持，给她加油，坚持带她去打针，其实她也想早点好。
My mother to see me difficult, at the beginning did not want to go to the hospital, I insisted, to cheer her up, insisted on taking her to injection, in fact, she also want to get better early.
后来我妈病情逐渐好转，可以走动了，体力也在恢复，也不发烧了。
Later my mother gradually improved, can move about, physical strength is also recovering, and do not have a fever.
只是我爸状况确实糟，染病以后，动都动不了，坐在轮椅上，吃饭还需要有人帮助，武汉市中心医院已经不收诊了，更不可能住进医院。
It's just that my father is really in a bad condition. After his illness, he can't move, sit in a wheelchair and need some help to eat.
没办法，昨天（指1月24日）打120，打一次没人、两次没人，第三次，得知我们的信息后，有专门救护车来，把我们送到武汉市武昌医院（西区）。
No way, yesterday (January 24) hit 120, hit no one, no one twice, the third time, after learning of our information, a special ambulance came, sent us to Wuhan Wuchang Hospital (West District).
运气不错，我们只排了3个小时就打上针了，并且这一天，武昌医院刚好腾出一栋楼来收治病人住院，我爸正好赶上了，感谢医院呀，我们终于有张病床了。
Luckily, we waited only three hours for the injection, and on that day, Wuchang Hospital just vacated a building to admit patients to hospital.
我得时时给父母打气，但其实，我也有崩溃的时候，至少也会有情绪低落的时候，这个时候，我就画画，消化掉。
I have to cheer my parents up all the time, but there are times when I break down and at least I get depressed.
家人支持明确分工做好营养保障我跟你说实话，我并不害怕，我也不认为所有去发热门诊看病的人都是感染者，其中一些可能是普通感冒，可能是过去常见的肺炎。
I tell you the truth, I'm not afraid, and I don't think all the people who go to the fever clinic are infected. Some of them may be common colds, probably the pneumonia that used to be common.
另外我也并不觉得自己有多惨，或者说，我不让自己去这么想，因为这样会失去信心。
Besides, I don't feel miserable, or I don't want to think like that, because I lose confidence.
我亲眼看到一家四口都被感染的病人，他们也没有放弃希望。
I saw a family of four infected patients who didn't give up hope either.
一定要提醒自己，要积极，不能崩。
Be sure to remind yourself to be positive and not to collapse.
其实我更想向一些病友家属分享一些护理心得。
In fact, I would like to share some nursing tips with the families of some sick friends.
因为这些动作不仅对家人身体有帮助，也会提振全家人的信心。
Because these actions not only help family members physically, but also boost family confidence.
我与我老公分工。
I divide my work with my husband.
他负责饮食，我负责带父母就医。
He is in charge of food and I take my parents to hospital.
因为，我们也不可能在外面吃，这样对他人也不负责任，外面的饮食也并不适合病人。
Because, we also cannot eat outside, this also is irresponsible to others, the outside food also is not suitable for the patient.
比如我妈，一开始何止胃口不好，那是上吐下泻，甚至闻到青菜的气味就想吐。
My mother, for example, had a bad appetite at first. It was vomiting and diarrhea, and even vomiting when she smelt green vegetables.
但我坚持让她吃东西，红薯煮稀饭、鸡汤，一天两个橙子，还有水煮鸡蛋。
But I insisted that she eat, sweet potato boiled porridge, chicken soup, two oranges a day, and boiled eggs.
吐了不要紧，一定要吃东西，这样才能增强抵抗力，跟病毒做斗争。
The vomit does not matter, must eat the food, in this way can strengthen the resistance, with the virus to fight.
我爸的饮食也是这样，他现在吃不进那些不好消化的东西，就用燕麦、小米煮稀饭，把炖好的鸡汤加入稀饭里，混着一起吃进去，这样才能保证可口与营养。
My father's diet is the same, he now can not eat those indigestible things, with oats, millet boiled rice porridge, cooked chicken soup into porridge, mixed to eat together, so as to ensure delicious and nutritious.
有时候，给他做点鸡蛋花。
Sometimes, make him some egg flowers.
虽然医院建议我不要去给我爸送饭，但我一天三次给他送过去，喂他吃下去，他也会觉得心里踏实，增加信心。
Although the hospital advised me not to bring food to my father, I sent it to him three times a day to feed him.
在防护上，我们也做好了隔离，家里人分区域住着，比如我老公睡客厅，那个地方我们就不去，还有厨房，哪怕是我也不进厨房，因为食物必须干净，这非常重要。
In terms of protection, we are also segregated, with sub-areas of the family, such as my husband sleeping in the living room, where we do not go, and the kitchen, where even I do not go, because it is very important that the food be clean.
我们都做好消毒、戴好口罩。
We all disinfect and wear masks.
我自己也提醒自己，要吃饱吃好，多吃，这样我的抵抗力就强。
I also remind myself, to eat well, eat more, so that my resistance will be strong.
你看，我不是现在没事吗。
Look, I'm not all right now.
我相信我的家人会好起来。
I'm sure my family will be fine.
在采访过程中，刘小煊有说有笑，她要求写上她的小名，她说已经跟许多朋友说过，让大家称她小煊，因为“煊”的意思是温暖，形容日出、明亮的意思。
During the interview, Liu Xiaohuen, who asked for her nickname, said she had told many of her friends that she was now called Huxuan, because "huxuan" meant warm and meant sunrise or bright.
当然整个采访过程，如此处境中的她依然给人明媚的感觉。
Of course, the whole interview process, in such a situation she still gives people a bright feeling.
只是采访结束后，她向本报记者打来电话说武汉主城区对私家车进行交通管制，获知消息时，她眼泪掉下来了：“我怎么给我爸送饭呢？”（编辑：郝成 校对：颜京宁）。
Only after the interview, she called our reporter to say that Wuhan Main City traffic control private cars, when she heard the news, she fell down tears: "How can I give my father rice?" (Hao Cheng proofread: Yan Jingning).
