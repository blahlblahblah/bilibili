澎湃新闻记者 贺梨萍 张若婷在法律政策允许并征得患者家属同意后，第一例、第二例新冠肺炎逝者遗体解剖工作已于2月16日在武汉市金银潭医院完成。
The autopsy of the remains of the deceased in the first and second cases of New Crown Pneumonia was completed on February 16 at the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital in Wuhan City.
2月16日至2月24日，由刘良及附属同济医院病理科王国平教授领衔的华中科技大学病理团队完成了9例遗体解剖。
From 16 February to 24 February, the pathology team of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, headed by Professor Wang Guoping, Pathology Department of Tongji Hospital, Liu Liang and affiliated Tongji Hospital, completed nine autopsies.
病理学专家卞修武院士和上海瑞金医院团队，也已完成2例新冠肺炎遗体解剖。
Bian Xiuwu, an expert in pathology, and the team from Shanghai Ruijin Hospital have also performed two autopsies on coronet pneumonia.
Play澎湃新闻记者：祝文博 编辑：林蓉 视频来源：相关人士责任编辑：周琦日前，刘良团队将其中一例尸体解剖观察预出版《新型冠状病毒肺炎死亡尸体系统解剖大体观察报告》（下称“《报告》”）发表于《法医学杂志》2020年2月第36卷第1期上，论文收稿于2月24日。
Liu Qi's team has pre-published the report on the General Anatomical Observation of the Coronavirus Pneumonia Dead Body System (hereinafter referred to as "the Report") published in the Journal of Forensic Medicine, February 20, 2020, vol. 36, No. 1.
通讯作者除刘良外，还包括华中科技大学同济医学院法医学系周亦武、任亮。
Besides Liu Liang, the author also includes Zhou Yiwu and Ren Liang, Department of Forensic Medicine, Tongji Medical School, Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
除华中科技大学同济医学院法医学外，作者还包括湖北崇新司法鉴定中心、上海公安学院的工作人员。
In addition to forensic medicine of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, the author also includes staffs of Hubei Chongxin Judicial Accreditation Center and Shanghai Public Security Academy.
《报告》内容为1例系统尸体解剖肉眼观察结果。
The report contained the results of a systematic autopsy with the naked eye.
研究团队指出，死者肺部损伤明显，肺肉眼观呈斑片状，可见灰白色病灶及暗红色出血，切面可见大量黏稠的分泌物从肺泡内溢出，提示新冠病毒主要引起深部气道和肺泡损伤为特征的炎性反应。
The team pointed out that the deceased had significant lung injury and a patchy lung-to-eye appearance, with grayish-white lesions and dark red hemorrhage, with large amounts of viscous secretions spilling over from the alveoli, suggesting an inflammatory response characterized by deep airway and alveolar damage.
该病例因“多发性脑梗死”入院后第13天经新型冠状病毒核酸检测为阳性，确诊为新型冠状病毒感染患者。
The patient was diagnosed as a new coronavirus infection 13 days after admission due to "multiple cerebral infarction" and positive for a new coronavirus.
入院后第20天复查CT显示：双肺散在斑片状感染病灶，较前进展，考虑“病毒性肺炎”，原气管腔内分泌物已消失。
On the 20th day after admission, CT scan showed that bilateral lung was scattered in the lesion of patchy infection. Compared with the previous progress, "viral pneumonia" was considered.
入院后28天死亡，临床死亡原因诊断为“新型冠状病毒肺炎、呼吸衰竭”。
28 days after admission, the clinical cause of death was diagnosed as "new coronavirus pneumonia, respiratory failure."
值得注意的是，此前由新冠肺炎死者尸体穿刺取样获得的组织局部病理学改变提示，新冠肺炎的病理特征与SARS和中东呼吸综合征（MERS）患者出现的病理特征非常类似。
It is worth noting that local histopathological changes previously obtained from cortical puncture samples of deceased patients with Newly Coronary Pneumonia suggest that the pathologic features of New Crown Pneumonia are very similar to those of patients with SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).
但《报告》此番指出，从此例系统解剖大体观察来看，肺部纤维化及实变没有SARS导致的病变严重，而渗出性反应较SARS明显，这可能与此例患者从确诊到死亡仅15天，病程较短有关，有待更多系统尸体检验资料及组织病理学验证。
However, the report notes from systematic autopsy that pulmonary fibrosis and consolidation are not as severe as SARS, while effusion is more pronounced than SARS, which may be related to the shorter duration of the patient from diagnosis to death, pending more systematic autopsy data and histopathological confirmation.
2月27日，在广州的疫情防控专场新闻通气会上，国家卫健委高级别专家组组长、国家呼吸系统疾病临床医学研究中心主任钟南山谈及新冠肺炎病理特点时同样提到，新冠肺炎和SARS不同，有个突出特点：小气道中黏液非常多，粘稠度很高，阻碍气道通畅，因而造成继发感染，以及更加严重化。
At a press briefing on February 27 in Guangzhou, Zhong Nan-shan, head of the high-level group of experts of the State Sanitary Commission and director of the National Clinical Research Centre for Respiratory Diseases, also mentioned that unlike SARS, Newcastle Pneumonia has a distinctive feature.
目前从两个地方的病理结果都发现，在小气道清除黏液是重要研究对象。
At present, the pathologic results from both places show that mucus removal in the airway is an important research object.
《报告》显示死者胸腔积液量不多，淡黄色清亮液体，未见大量胸水产生，提示胸腔病变并非浆液性炎症为主。
The report showed that the deceased did not have much pleural effusion, light yellow light liquid, no large amount of pleural fluid produced, suggesting that the pleural lesions were not serous inflammation.
此外，解剖见心包腔内中等量淡黄色清亮液体，心外膜轻度水肿，心肌切面呈灰红色鱼肉状。
In addition, the anatomy showed that the pericardium had a light yellow light liquid, a mild epicardial edema and a grayish red fish-like carcass.
因患者临床资料显示存在冠心病、心绞痛病史，心肌及心外膜是否存在与病毒感染相关的损害表现有待进一步研究。
The clinical data of patients with coronary heart disease, angina pectoris history, myocardial and pericardium whether there are viral infection-related damage performance needs to be further studied.
此例消化系统损伤情况肉眼观不明显。
The damage of digestive system is not obvious to the naked eye.
值得一提的是，研究人员发现小肠呈节段性扩张与狭窄相间（类似串珠状），为个例或普遍表现需结合更多尸体检验情况。
It is worth mentioning that the researchers found that the small intestine was segmented with narrow phases (similar to beads), which, for individual cases or common manifestations, needed to be combined with more post-mortem examination.
脾肉眼观未见明显异常，是否存在病变需进行组织病理学研究。
There was no obvious abnormality in spleen's unaided eye and histopathological study was needed.
肾呈颗粒性固缩肾外观，考虑与基础疾病有关。
The kidney is granular in appearance and is considered to be related to basic diseases.
关于神经系统，肉眼观见脑水肿，大脑皮质轻度萎缩。
With regard to the nervous system, the unaided eye sees cerebral edema and mild atrophy of the cerebral cortex.
结合临床资料，患者年龄大，有多发性脑梗死及脑血管病后遗症，脑肉眼观未见感染特异性表现，病毒是否侵犯中枢神经系统有待组织病理学验证。
Combined with clinical data, the patient was old, had multiple cerebral infarction and sequelae of cerebrovascular disease, no specific manifestations of infection were seen in the unaided eye, and whether the virus invaded the central nervous system was subject to histopathological verification.
刘良团队在《报告》中写道，新型冠状病毒肺炎自2019年12月起，已造成中国7万余人确诊感染，2千多人死亡。
Since December 2019, the new coronavirus pneumonia has infected more than 70,000 people in China and killed more than 2,000, Liu's team wrote in the report.
截至2020年2月24日，全国新冠肺炎患者死亡率达3.17%，此前报道的武汉金银潭医院早期收治的99例COVID-19患者中，死亡11例，死亡率为11%。
As of February 24, 2020, the mortality rate of newly reported cases of pneumonia nationwide was 3.17 percent, and 11 of the 99 COVID-19 patients admitted to Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital had died, representing a mortality rate of 11 percent.
由于一直缺乏系统尸体解剖提供的完整病理学资料，研究人员对疾病的发病机制、器官损害等影响无法确切判断。
Due to the lack of complete pathologic data from systematic autopsies, the researchers were unable to determine exactly the pathogenesis of the disease, organ damage, etc.
刘良团队认为，这份尸解报告提供了直观的病变情况，或将为临床治疗方案的调整提供依据。
Liang's team believes that the autopsy report provides an intuitive picture of the lesion or may provide a basis for adjusting the clinical treatment protocol.
尸体解剖工作被认为是疫情防控的重要环节，是查明死亡原因、分析发病机理、追溯病源的金标准。
Autopsy is regarded as an important link in disease prevention and control. It is the gold standard to find out the cause of death, analyze the pathogenesis and trace the pathogenesis.
值得一提的是，在此次尸体检验之前，目前与新冠肺炎死亡相关的病理检验报道有2篇，但均未进行尸体解剖。
It is worth mentioning that before the autopsy, there were 2 reports of pathologic examination related to death from neonatal pneumonia, but no autopsy was performed.
其中一篇来自中科院院士、国家感染性疾病临床医学研究中心主任王福生教授率领的团队，他们的研究来源于新冠肺炎死者的穿刺材料的病理发现，于2月18日在国际著名医学学术期刊《柳叶刀-呼吸医学》(The Lancet Respiratory Medicine)发表，提示 新冠肺炎的病理学改变与急性呼吸窘迫综合征相关。
A team led by Professor Wang Fusheng, academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and director of the National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, was published on February 18 in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, an internationally renowned medical academic journal, suggesting a link between pathologic changes and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
另一篇来自武汉大学中南医院肖书渊主任医师团队，他们于2月16日在预印本网站Preprint发表文章，报道了1例肺肿瘤同时并发新冠肺炎患者肺切除术后肺组织的病理检验结果，有与上述穿刺样本类似的改变。
A team of Xiao Shuyuan doctors from Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital published an article on February 16 on the pre-printed website Preprint, reporting pathological changes in lung tissue following pulmonary resection in a patient with pulmonary neoplasm complicated with new crown pneumonia, similar to the puncture sample described above.
