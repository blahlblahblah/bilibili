被BBC报道，这位武汉独居者连续写了44天封城日记。
The Wuhan loner kept a 44-day diary of the city, BBC reported.

1月23日凌晨2点的一纸封城令，让留在这个城市的900万人，不得不承受封城的集体共命。
On January 23, at 2: 00 a.m., a closure order, leaving the city's 9 million people, had to bear the collective fate of the blockade.
处境和遭遇的不同，让同一片封城的天空下，生发出千万种不同的生活。
Circumstances and encounters different, let the same block of the sky, the birth of a million different life.
当大多数武汉人以家庭为单位防御新冠的时候，还有一些少数派，以异乡者的身份身陷武汉，孤军奋战。
While most Wuhan people defend their new crown in terms of family, there are also a few minority groups, as aliens in Wuhan, fighting alone.
郭晶就是其中的一员。
Guo Jing is one of them.
去年11月才从广州搬来武汉的她，是这个城市里的“外来者”。
She moved to Wuhan from Guangzhou in November last year and is an "outsider" in the city.
她没有特殊的身份加持，是疫情之下不折不扣的普通人。
She does not have a special status, and is completely normal under the epidemic.
但同时，她坚持写封城日记，持续观察、记录以及思考，让我们看到了一个普通人在疫情之下，如何努力维持自我以及重拾对生活的掌控感。
At the same time, however, she kept a closed-door diary, constantly observing, recording, and reflecting on how ordinary people struggle to maintain themselves and regain a sense of control over their lives in the face of an epidemic.
以下是少数派郭晶的武汉生存报告。
Here is the Wuhan survival report of Guo Jing minority.
郭晶独自在出租屋里度过了武汉封城的一个多月。
Guo Jing spent more than a month alone in a rented house in Wuhan.
那是个不到二十平的单间，在积玉桥附近的一个老小区，站在窗边能看到地铁站。
It was a single room of less than twenty levels, in an old neighborhood near Jade Bridge, and stood by the window looking at the subway station.
从小区到江滩只有不到五百米。
It is less than 500 meters from the community to the riverbank.
去年十一月，她从广州搬到这里，没有合租者，也没有养动物。
Last November, she moved here from Guangzhou without tenants or animals.
所以关上门，就只剩她自己。
So shut the door, and it's just her.
封城后，在朋友的建议下她开始写日记，成为一名记录者，记录在武汉的感受和见闻。
After the closure of the city, in the advice of her friends began to write a diary, a record of her feelings and experience in Wuhan.
她此前很少写日记，所以持续写作是一个挑战。
She had seldom kept a diary before, so continuing to write was a challenge.
第一篇日记发在封城当晚，配了一张空荡荡的马路照片，在微博上获得了近五千转发和一万多点赞。
The first diary was posted on the night of the city, with an empty road photo, and received nearly 5, 000 transmissions and more than 10, 000 reviews on Weibo.
郭晶在1月23日的日记里的配图“我算是一个遇事冷静和淡定的人，直到1月20日武汉新增病例过百，别的省市出现病例，我开始感到不知所措。
"I was a calm and collected person until January 20, when more than 100 new cases were reported in Wuhan and other provinces and municipalities began to overwhelm me," Guo wrote in her diary on January 23.
”郭晶在第一篇日记的开头这样写道。
"Guo writes at the beginning of her first diary.
她前三天的日记，经朋友整理发到网上，获得了十万加的阅读。
Her diary of the first three days, collated by friends sent to the Internet, to obtain 100,000 additional reading.
BBC中文转载了那篇《一个独居女性的武汉封城日记》，为它配上插画。
BBC Chinese reproduces the "Wuhan Seal Diary of a Female Living Alone" with illustrations.
很多人评论说看后感到安心，能够了解生活在武汉的人的真实状态。
Many people commented that they felt at ease after reading, and were able to understand the real situation of people living in Wuhan.
一些人给她捐口罩等物资，一个南京网友说要寄盐水鸭。
Some gave her masks and other supplies, and one netizen in Nanjing said he would send salt and water ducks.
BBC为郭晶的日记配上的插画郭晶开始没想到会有那么多人看，得到支持后，“更有动力写下去”。
Guo Jingjing, the BBC's diary with illustrations, initially did not expect so many people to see, after the support, "more motivated to write down."
她忠实地记录了自己身为一名普通人，如何应对突如其来的封城。
She faithfully recorded how, as an ordinary person, she had coped with the sudden closure of the city.
她先在App上下了订单，担心外卖“随时会停”，又出门去超市抢购。
She placed her order at App, worried that takeout would "stop anytime" and went out to the supermarket to snap it up.
买东西的人排了长队，她遇到一个因为担心可能封城一年而买了很多盐的男人。
There was a long line of shoppers, and she met a man who had bought a lot of salt for fear that the city might be closed for a year.
她没有车，也没有携带工具，一次拿不了太多东西，所以回家后她再次出门。
She didn't have a car, she didn't have tools, she couldn't carry much at a time, so she went out again when she got home.
超市的许多货架空了，大米和面粉所剩无几。
Many shelves in the supermarket were empty and there was little rice or flour left.
药店开始控制人进入，感冒药限购，口罩和酒精被抢购一空。
Pharmacies began to control access, cold medicines were restricted, masks and alcohol were snapped up.
她后知后觉地对第一趟出门成功抢到物资，产生了“绝望的欣喜”，同时感到害怕，继而又觉得“即便封城应该还是会有日常生活用品供应”。
She was shocked by the success of her first trip, which produced a "hopeless exultation" and a sense of fear that "even if the city were to be shut down there would still be a daily supply of supplies."
晚上躺下后，她哭了一次。
After lying down at night, she cried once.
她的日记透露着不安和焦虑，因为对生活失去了掌控感和力量感。
Her diary reveals restlessness and anxiety because of a loss of control and power over life.
作为一名社工，也是一名二级心理咨询师，她喜欢理性思考，生活有序。
As a social worker and a second-level psychologist, she likes to think rationally and live an orderly life.
但忽如起来的封城打乱了一切，没有通知说封城会持续多久，人们的生活有没有保障。
But a sudden siege of the city disrupted everything, did not tell how long the closure will last, people have no security of life.
所以在一开始，囤积物资是最本能的，也是最有用的自救行为。
So in the beginning, hoarding material is the most instinctive, but also the most useful act of self-help.
排队购物的人而独居意味着她只能靠自己。
Living alone in line means she has to fend for herself.
她在武汉没有朋友，也没有加社区的微信群，获取信息的渠道只有互联网。
She has no friends in Wuhan, no community micro-groups, access to information only the Internet.
在最初的几天，网上的传播是混乱的，真实的信息和虚假的谣言混杂在一起，滋生了许多恐慌和愤怒。
In the first few days, online communication was chaotic, with real information mixed with false rumours, spawning much panic and anger.
她没法判断它们的真假，更重要的是，作为一个异乡人，她不了解周围的环境。
She could not judge whether they were true or false. More importantly, as an alien, she did not know her surroundings.
事实证明，写日记对梳理思维和生活有所帮助。
Facts have proved that diary writing is helpful in combing thinking and life.
她花了大概一周时间，重拾了自己对生活的掌控感和力量感。
It took her about a week to regain her sense of control and power over her life.
她每天九点左右起床，只比正常时候晚一点点，然后跟着keep运动半个小时，已经连续打卡了五百四十四天。
She gets up at about nine o'clock every day, a little later than usual, and then follows Keep for half an hour and has had five hundred and forty-four consecutive days.
如果天气好，她会外出。
She will go out if the weather is fine.
下午的时候用一两个小时写日记，晚上和朋友视频，二十四点左右睡觉。
Spend an hour or two in the afternoon keeping a diary, video with friends at night, and sleeping around twenty-four.
在大年初一那天，路过花店时她买了一盆绿萝。
On New Year's Day, she bought a pot of green pineapple as she passed the florist's shop.
来武汉的两个月，郭晶大半时间里深居简出。
Two months after coming to Wuhan, Guo Jing lived mostly in seclusion.
外出时她去过东湖，在汉口看了场电影，在武昌的江滩跑步，最远的一次去江夏爬了六个多小时山，全程二十几公里。
She went out to the East Lake, saw a film in Hankou, ran in Wuchang's riverfront, the furthest climb to Jiangxia more than six hours, the entire journey of more than 20 kilometers.
但对这个城市以及生活在其中的人，她依然显得陌生。
But she was still a stranger to the city and the people who lived in it.
所以封城后，她果敢地决定出门。
So she decided to go out after sealing the city.
出门让她不再隔绝，与人有了交际。
Going out made her no longer isolated and sociable.
她观察路人，计算遇到的数量，留意他们买了什么东西，和其中一些——比如当时还在营业的腰花面店的老板聊天。
She watches passers-by, calculates the number of people she encounters, notices what they buy, and chats with some of them, such as the owner of a cashew noodle shop that was open at the time.
她的目的是了解别人的生活，“让我觉得慢慢跟这个世界有了一些联系”。
Her aim was to understand the lives of others, "to make me feel that I have some contact with the world."
看到外卖员还在送餐，她感到安慰，“外卖是一个象征，是城市生活还在运行的一个标志。
"Taking out is a symbol, a sign that life in the city is still running," she said, comforting to see the takeaway man delivering the meal.
”外卖小哥废墟里的流浪猫但她心里更多的，还是因情况不明确而产生的焦虑。
"The stray cat in the ruins of her take-out brother, but more in her heart, was the anxiety over the lack of clarity.
她每天都要去超市和药店走一遭，“像是在抓住最后一些可以抓住的东西”。
Every day, she goes to the supermarket and drugstore for a walk, "as if she's grasping the last thing to catch."
口罩和酒精依旧无货。
Masks and alcohol remain out of stock.
她囤了足够吃一个月的食物，还是忍不住购买。
She could not help buying enough food for a month, according to the source.
“匮乏让人没有安全感，尤其在这种有关生存的极端情况下。
"Lack makes people insecure, especially in extreme situations involving survival.
”超市里头戴塑料袋的顾客她有意地开始控制饮食，每顿一个菜，量是平时的一半。
"Shoppers in the supermarket She purposely began to control her diet, eating half as much food per meal as usual.
中午和晚上喝白粥，为了减少刷锅的次数，会一次熬一天的量。
Drink porridge at noon and night, in order to reduce the number of times brush pot, will boil a day.
当然，年夜饭没有减量，她煮了三百克玉米蔬菜猪肉馅的饺子，又做了五个红烧鸡翅。
Of course, the dinner did not reduce, she cooked 300 grams of corn and vegetables pork dumplings, and made five red-roasted chicken wings.
过年她没有回家，一开始也没告诉家人自己身在武汉。
She did not go home over the New Year and did not tell her family that she was in Wuhan at first.
所幸他们彼此身体健康，都没有感染病毒。
Fortunately, they were healthy enough to be free of the virus.
郭晶的年夜饭外出时，她会采访遇到的环卫工，“觉得环卫工的状况最差，没有保障，就想多了解一下”。
When Guo Jing goes out for dinner, she will interview the sanitation workers she meets. "I think sanitation workers are in the worst condition.
情况不太乐观。
The picture is not encouraging.
这是一个长期处于边缘位置的群体，媒体很少关注，但疫情期间同样需要工作。
This is a long-standing marginalized group that receives little media attention, but also needs to work during the epidemic.
她发现他们缺少保护措施，只有很少几个口罩。
She found that they lacked protection and had only a few face masks.
有一个大姐告诉她，他们中很多都不是正式工，如果不工作，一天要扣一百五十块，而日工资只有七十。
One older sister told her that many of them were not regular workers and that if they did not work, they had to pay 150 yuan a day instead of 70 a day.
他们不清楚有没有补贴。
They do not know if there are subsidies.
他们的人生各有各的不幸。
Each of them is unhappy in his own way.
告别时，她会送环卫工几个口罩，互道保重。
Farewell, she will send a few sanitary workers a few masks, take good care of each other.
有的隔天再见，会和她打招呼。
Some see you the next day and say hello.
环卫工人和手套进入二月后，外省往武汉捐赠物资，超市里的蔬菜得到补充，气氛也就不那么紧张。
After the sanitary workers and gloves entered February, the province to Wuhan donated supplies, the supermarket vegetables were replenished, the atmosphere is not so tense.
郭晶在路上遇到的人多了起来，有人戴着口罩跑步，有人使用健身器材，还有人在江边打太极。
Guo encountered more people on the road, some running wearing masks, some using fitness equipment, and others playing Taiji along the river.
她在2月3日的日记里写道：“每天出门成为我的一个重要日常。
"Going out every day has become an important routine for me," she wrote in her February 3 diary.
其实我已经觉得出门不是必要，可我还在偏执地坚持。
In fact, I already feel out of the door is not necessary, but I still paranoid insisted.
我在坚持什么？这个城市不会在明天突然解封，外面不会在一日之内发生翻天覆地的改变。
What am I insisting on? The city will not be suddenly unsealed tomorrow. It will not change dramatically in one day.
这其实是一个微小的反抗，在信息的封锁中寻找真实的信息，在隔离中寻求和他人的联系，在不确定中寻找某种确定性。
This is actually a small resistance, in the blocking of information to find real information, in isolation to seek contact with others, in uncertainty to find some certainty.
”江滩绿道李文亮去世那天，郭晶又哭了一次。
"Guo cried again the day he died on Green Road in Jiangtan.
作为个体，在这次疫情期间，很多时候没有选择，只能被迫地“随波逐流”。
As individuals, many times during the epidemic there was no choice but to "drift with the tide."
像是某种宿命论。
Like some kind of fatalism.
她写了一些话，后来日记被限流。
She wrote a few words and later her diary was restricted.
接着在2月中旬，武汉各小区实施封闭管理。
Then in mid-February, the Wuhan small districts to implement the closed management.
郭晶最初觉得“需要帮助的人很多，我还可以自己照顾自己，可是，现在我被迫需要帮助”。
Guo initially felt that "there are many people in need and I can take care of myself, but now I am forced to need help."
她从自由出门，变成三天一出，再变成无法外出。
She went out of the house freely, became three days, and then became unable to go out.
为了买菜，她加了社区的微信群，开始研究超市的AB套餐和各种团购接龙。
In order to buy vegetables, she added the community micro-group, began to study the supermarket AB package and various group purchase catchments.
出入证她对封闭管理和团购，同样发出了作为受到影响的个体的质疑，但措辞比前几天温和不少。
She also raised questions about closed management and group buying as affected individuals, but the wording was much softer than in previous days.
她连着写了很长时间的封城日记，经历过许多愤怒、伤心、无力，最后变得有些麻木——她没有停止思考和记录，但被太多糙心事打击得疲惫不堪。
She kept her city diary for a long time, experienced a lot of anger, sadness, weakness, and finally became numb - she did not stop thinking and recording, but was exhausted by too much pellagra.
除了不能出小区，她的出租房在暴雨中漏水，拖把和锅也坏了。
Except that she couldn't get out of the house, her rented house leaked in the storm and her mop and saucepan broke.
“我都没有了‘今天周几’的概念，只有‘今天’和‘明天’”。
"I don't even have the concept of 'what day of the week', just 'today' and 'tomorrow'.
出租屋里漏水的墙上的插座她的日记中少了外出的见闻，增多了和朋友的讨论。
outlet in the leaking wall of the rented room Her diary was devoid of stories about going out and more discussions with her friends.
她的不少朋友也是社工志愿者，且都是女权主义者，所以讨论的内容经常与女权有关。
Many of her friends also volunteer social workers and are feminists, so much of the discussion is about women's rights.
他们担心女性会在疫情造成的裁员中受到不公正待遇。
They fear that women will be unfairly treated in the face of the layoffs caused by the epidemic.
他们讨论女性不平等的来源，以及女性的牺牲和痛苦。
They discussed the sources of female inequality and the sacrifices and suffering of women.
甘肃被剃光头的女护士，图片来源于网络在甘肃女护士剃光头的新闻成为热点时，郭晶写道：“头发关乎的不只是外貌，而是尊严。
"Hair is not just about appearance, it's dignity," Guo wrote as the online news of shaved heads of female nurses in Gansu province became popular.
剃头是否必要？是否经过同意？女性的身体从未真正属于自己，总是有人比女人自己更有权力处置女人的身体。
Is shaving necessary? With consent? Women's bodies never really belong to themselves, and there are always people who have more power over women's bodies than women themselves.
”社区团购的肉爱心包菜作为一名社工，她对这类新闻格外敏感。
As a social worker, Carnival Shoppers, a community group, is particularly sensitive to such news.
她在2017年发起“074职场女性法律热线”，为遭遇性别歧视等职场问题的女性提供经验和法律上的帮助。
She launched the "074 Women in the Workplace Legal Hotline" in 2017 to provide experience and legal assistance to women experiencing workplace problems such as gender discrimination.
团队在线上工作，没有固定的办公地点，求助者拨打074热线，会直接转接到手机，所以受疫情影响不大。
The team work online, there is no fixed office location, callers call 074 hotline, will be directly connected to the mobile phone, so not affected by the epidemic.
在疫情期间，她接听了一对武汉夫妻的电话，女性在国企工作，因为怀孕受到公司的隐性劝退。
During the outbreak, she answered a phone call from a Wuhan husband and wife who worked for a state-owned enterprise because their pregnancy had been tacitly encouraged by the company.
小区里晒太阳的人前段时间天气好的时候，郭晶会坐在楼下晒太阳。
Some time ago, when the people in the community bask in the sun, Guo will sit downstairs to bask in the sun.
小区里一些住户同样下楼散步。
Some residents of the community also went downstairs for a walk.
一个中年男人用手机放着戏曲。
A middle-aged man played opera on his cell phone.
一些人摘下口罩抽烟。
Some people take off their masks and smoke.
偶尔有女人下口拿菜或丢垃圾。
Every once in a while, women take a bite to pick up food or litter.
有人在楼外晒床单、枕头。
Someone is drying sheets and pillows outside the building.
生活平静，还在继续。
Life is calm and still going on.
