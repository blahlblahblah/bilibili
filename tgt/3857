In a later interview with NBC, Prizek said the federal government, aware that many Americans would be returning home by the end of the week, should have added customs, border and CDC inspectors at airports, but they didn't: "Hundreds of people packed into the cramped airport space is the last thing that should happen during a global pandemic."

她认为特朗普在2018年砍掉“白宫流行病办公室”的决定是造成今天美国应对新冠肺炎疫情决策迟缓，执行力不强的重要原因。
