Play第二集：久别武汉新冠肺炎最为猛烈时，一支来自南京的医疗队进驻武汉同济医院，开始了一场艰难的战役。
Wuhan Hengcang Pneumonia the most violent, a medical team from Nanjing entered the Wuhan Tongji Hospital, began a difficult battle.
与此同时，本刊编辑陈玮曦带着摄影机走进重症病房，记录下了医生和病患并肩作战的日日夜夜。
At the same time, our editor Chen Weixi entered the intensive care unit with a camera and recorded the doctors and patients fighting side by side day and night.
《时尚先生 Esquire》联合腾讯新闻，正在连续发布系列纪录短片《武汉·重症区六层》，本视频为系列第二集。
"Esquire Fashion" joint Tencent News, is a series of short documentary series "Wuhan severe area six," this video for the second episode in the series.
该内容为《时尚先生 Esquire》与腾讯新闻独家合作内容，谢绝转载武汉·重症区六层（1）：凌晨一点 病房外传来了砸门声 当你老了，睡意沉沉67岁的周开琴（音）做完 CT 之后在走廊呆了一会，并且「骂」了护士一顿。
The story is about "Mr. Esquire" and "Tencent News." The six-storey Wuhan-intensive area outside the 1: 00 a. m. ward came a knock on the door. When you get old, sleepy 67-year-old Zhou Kaiqin stays in the hallway after a CT scan and "scolds" the nurse.
病人们不能随意走动，她是唯一有「特权」的患者。
Patients can't move around freely. She's the only one with "privileges."
她已经快两周没见过丈夫。
She hasn't seen her husband in nearly two weeks.
当 66 岁的老头子躺在病床上被推出来，她沉默，看着他哭，就像五天前看着他照片哭那样。
When the 66-year-old man was wheeled out of his bed, she was silent, watching him cry, as she had seen his picture cry five days earlier.
照片是护士长拿着她的手机去隔壁拍的一段视频的封面，视频里老头子戴着面罩告诉她，「没事」。
The picture shows the head nurse holding her cell phone next door to a video showing the Don wearing a mask and telling her, "It's OK."
她就那么看着视频封面。
She's just looking at the video cover.
有人告诉她按中间的按钮可以播放，但她还是那样看着，屏幕暗了就按亮，眼泪流下来。
She was told to press the middle button to play, but she looked at it like that, pressing the screen dark and tears streaming down her face.
周开琴不是武汉人，年长后和丈夫追随开餐馆的儿子定居。
Zhou Kaiqin is not from Wuhan. He and his husband settled down with their son who opened a restaurant.
她是最温和最礼貌的那种病人，相信大夫，不太会用手机也不多问，医生和护士问她的需要，她只说想见隔壁病房的丈夫：在那场凌晨的收治中，因为事出紧急，也因为病床紧张，他们被依性别分开，她的病很快好转，他却一直在恶化。
The doctors and nurses asked her what she needed. All she said was that she wanted to see her husband in the next room: during the early morning admission, because of the urgency of the matter and because the beds were so tight that they were separated by sex, she quickly recovered and he kept getting worse.
武汉同济医院光谷院区 E1 区六层的病人大多年事已高，他们想念老伴和子女，想念熟悉的生活。
Wuhan Tongji Hospital Guanggu courtyard area E1 six-storey patients are very old, they miss their old wife and children, miss the familiar life.
一位老人离家时带上了写着三儿子电话的纸条，从隔离点到医院，她一直贴身揣着；另一位老人给医生看她常吃的药，医生要给她对症开更好的，她却不想换；最特别的那位——唯一一个总是从病房跑出来的老爷子，跟护士聊了很久往事，告诉她自己当兵的时候见过周总理。
One old man left home with a note with his third son's telephone written on it. From the isolation point to the hospital, she was carrying it closely. Another old man showed the doctor the medicine she often took, but she didn't want to change it.
护士告诉他病情在好转，劝他不要再出来，他答应了，两天后在走廊上哭着要拖鞋，说按照老家的习俗死前要好好洗个澡。
When the nurse told him that he was getting better and advised him not to come out again, he agreed and, two days later, wept in the hallway and asked for slippers, saying that he should take a good bath before he died in accordance with the customs of his hometown.
护士长吴静说，病人们不愿意医护人员在病房呆太久，不想传染他们；病房里友好和睦，如果有人提出要安静，或者不想看电视，其他人都愿意依着他的需要。
Patients do not want medical staff to stay in the wards too long to infect them, said Nurse Wu. People in the ward are friendly and friendly.
「在这个特殊的时期，」她这样总结，「爱好像被放大了。
"At this particular time," she concluded, "love seems to be magnified.
