”自1月26日大年初二开始，陈泽的甲鱼一只都卖不出去了。
Chen Ze's turtle hasn't sold since January 26, the second day of the Lunar New Year.
陈泽是广东揭阳的一名甲鱼养殖户，从业已有10年了。
Chen Ze is a turtles farm in Jieyang, Guangdong, which has been operating for 10 years.
原本他的甲鱼有八成会供给广州、深圳的水产市场销售，剩下的零散在淘宝上销往全国各地。
Originally his turtle 80% will supply Guangzhou, Shenzhen aquaculture market for sale, the rest scattered throughout the country on Taobao.
然而今年为了防控疫情，广州早在1月底便已全面封禁了甲鱼销售的主要集中地黄沙市场，线上销售也逐渐停摆。
This year, however, Guangzhou banned the Huangsha market, the main destination for turtle sales, as early as the end of January to prevent the disease, and online sales have ground to a halt.
他只能苦苦等待，祈祷疫情好转。
He had to wait and pray that the situation would improve.
但更先到来的，是全国禁止食用和买卖野生动物的各项规定。
But even before that came a nationwide ban on eating and trading in wild animals.
2020年2月25日，深圳率先强力“禁野”，点名将“甲鱼”排除在可食用动物范围之外。
On February 25, 2020, Shenzhen took the lead in imposing a "ban" by naming and shaming "turtles" out of the range of edible animals.
深圳市人大常委会法工委在深圳市人大官方网站上发布了一则《深圳经济特区全面禁止食用野生动物条例（草案征求意见稿）》（下称《征求意见稿》）。
On the official website of the Shenzhen Municipal People's Congress, the Standing Committee of the Shenzhen Municipal People's Congress published a draft of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone Regulations on the Prohibition of Consumption of Wild Animals (draft Exposure Draft).
相关负责人特别解释道，对于社会比较关注的经人工繁育、饲养的龟、甲鱼等野生动物，也具有不小的疫病传播风险，无法保证食用的安全性，此次也将上述动物排除在可食用动物范围之外。
The head of the department explained that wild animals such as turtles, turtles and turtles, which are of great concern to society, were also at great risk of spreading the disease and could not guarantee safe food.
“反正如果不能养的话，真的就手停口停。
"If I can't support it anyway, I'll stop by hand.
”每年炎热的6、7月份，陈泽会在自己的4亩水塘里洒下苗子，细心养护，等待12个月后甲鱼的长成。
In the hot months of June and July, Chen Ze would plant seeds in his 4-acre pond and carefully maintain them, waiting for the turtle to grow in 12 months.
到那时，他才能完全收获这一年辛勤劳动的成果，大约是40万元。
Only then will he be able to reap the full fruits of his hard work of the year, about 400,000 yuan.
这也是他一家老小生计的来源。
It was also the source of his family's livelihood.
今年，他只能望着水塘还在不断长大的甲鱼，不知如何是好。
This year, he could only look at the growing turtle in the pond, not knowing what to do.
这样的甲鱼养殖户在陈泽的村子里还有很多。
Such turtle farmers in Chen Ze's village there are many.
经过20年的积累，整个村子甲鱼养殖的从业人员将近5000人，占全村人口的4成。
After 20 years of accumulation, nearly 5,000 people worked in turtle culture in the whole village, accounting for 40 percent of the total population.
用于养殖的土地面积达1000亩，每年需要消耗5000万的甲鱼苗，产值高达一个亿。
The area of land used for breeding amounts to 1000 mu and 50 million nail saplings a year, worth up to one billion yuan.
但如今，这些全部停滞。
But all of this is now at a standstill.
“像我们村整个4成人就可以说都没有收入了。
"" The whole four grown-ups in our village have practically no income.
”陈泽以及村里的同行，除了无法处理已经养成的甲鱼外，也并没有办法转卖转养其他水产品。
Mr Chen and his village counterparts, apart from being unable to dispose of the turtles that they had developed, had no way of reselling other aquatic products.
由于甲鱼是两栖动物，适合养甲鱼的水质并不适合去养鱼虾，贸然转行，也并不确保能养成。
Since the turtle is an amphibian, the quality of the water suitable for the turtle is not suitable for fish and shrimp farming, the sudden change of profession, also does not ensure that it can be formed.
而且即使要转，目前村里已经建成的厂房、硬件设施全部都得卖掉。
And even if it were to turn around, all the factory buildings and hardware already built in the village would have to be sold.
甲鱼苗子在夏天被放到水塘里，一年之后再捕捞上来。
The turtle seeds are put in the pond in the summer and caught a year later.
这只是整个甲鱼产业链的一个小小缩影。
This is only a small miniature of the entire chain of turtle industry.
在广东地区，食用甲鱼进补已成为一种传统，它的身影遍布南方。
In Guangdong, it has become a tradition to eat turtle feed, and its presence is widespread in the south.
广东珠江卫视的特约评论员饶原生也曾提供过一组数据：广东目前有龟鳖类养殖场点9万个，从业人员34万人，现行总产值近千亿元。
Rao Yuansheng, a guest commentator for Guangdong's Pearl River TV, also provided a set of data: Guangdong currently has 90,000 turtle farm operations with 340,000 employees, with a total current output value of nearly 100 billion yuan.
他同时表示，如果不问青红皂白全部禁止交易和食用，恐怕影响很大。
He also states that the effect would be significant if the trade and consumption were to be prohibited across the board.
陈泽认为，如果只论甲鱼这个品类，是不是野生的非常好辨认，直接全面禁止太过绝对。
Chen Ze thinks, if discuss turtle this category only, be wild very easy to recognize, direct complete prohibition is too absolute.
“如果有可能的话，政府出台一个规范性的文件，指导养殖户怎么去养殖、出售，这个才是关键。
"If possible, the government will issue a regulatory document to guide farmers on how to breed and sell, which is the key."
”在疫情爆发以前，根据2016年的《中华人民共和国野生动物保护法(修订草案)》，国家只规定了禁止食用的野生动物为国家重点保护动物。
Before the outbreak, under the 2016 Wildlife Protection Law of the People's Republic of China (Revised Draft), the state designated only those wild animals that are banned from eating as key state-protected animals.
其他非国家重点保护野生动物并未被纳入禁止食用范畴。
Other non-state protected wildlife is not included in the ban.
草案同时提出，此举并非提倡食用非国家重点保护野生动物，而是在现有情况下，食用野生鱼、野兔子等未尝不可，法律不禁止，但也不提倡。
The bill also argues that this is not to promote the consumption of non-state-focused wildlife, but rather, in the current situation, to eat wild fish, rabbits and so on, the law does not prohibit, but does not promote.
甲鱼属于鳖类动物。
The turtle belongs to the turtle group.
但多数鳖类动物已经被列入《国家重点保护动物名录》及《国家保护的有益或者有重要经济、科学研究价值的陆生动物名录》和《国家水生野生动物保护名录》。
However, most of the turtle species are on the List of Specially Protected Animals of the State and the List of Land Animals under State Protection that are of Helpful or of Important Economic and Scientific Value, and the State Catalogue for the Protection of Aquatic Wildlife.
根据《中华人民共和国野生动物保护法》，个人或企业驯养繁殖任何一种龟鳖动物都必须办理驯养繁殖许可证；如果驯养目的为经营利用的，还需要办理《野生动物驯养繁殖许可证》，并向工商行政管理部门申请登记注册。
According to the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Wild Animals, an individual or an enterprise must obtain a license for domestication and breeding of any turtle animal; if the purpose of domestication is for business use, it is necessary to obtain a Permit for the Training and Reproduction of Wild Animals and apply for registration with the administrative department for industry and commerce.
而在深圳《征求意见稿》出台的第二天，2020年2月26日，广州政府便召开新闻发布会，表示除了家畜家禽类，禁食所有陆生野生动物。
On February 26, 2020, the day after Shenzhen's exposure draft came out, the Guangzhou government held a press conference saying it would not eat any terrestrial wildlife other than livestock and poultry.
随后，2月27日，全国人大常委会也做出全面禁野的进一步决定。
Then, February 27, the Standing Committee of the NPC Standing Committee also made a comprehensive ban on further decisions.
从2月27日起，全国范围内的食用野生动物市场和交易将被彻底取缔。
From February 27, the national food wildlife market and trade will be completely banned.
凡是从事以食用为目的的野生动物人工繁育，许可证都要撤销。
The license shall be revoked for any artificial breeding of wild animals for the purpose of food.
这就意味着，全国饲养繁殖与买卖野生动物的行业全面取缔。
This means that the national breeding and trading industry has been completely banned.
在这个规定下，被列入水生野生动物范畴内的甲鱼，也不能在被人工饲养与销售。
Under this provision, turtles included in the category of aquatic wildlife are not allowed to be raised and sold artificially.
面对各种政策，陈泽仍表示理解，但他仍计划着与村里的养殖户、经销商一起，联名向有关部门反映他们的困难，希望政府能将甲鱼养殖规范化和标准化，而非直接让村里的池塘变成一潭死水。
Chen still understands the policies, but he plans to share his difficulties with farmers and dealers in the village, hoping the government will normalize and standardise turtle farming rather than turn the village pond into a backwater.
