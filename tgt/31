72小时全记录，我在K3列车上见证“跨国疫情”。

著名的K3列车。
The famous K3 train.
/ 作者供图K3列车宛若平静驶过新型肺炎暴风眼的一叶小舟，看似与国内处处危殆的疫情彻底隔绝，却无时不被事关自身命运的信息和舆论拍打。
/ The writer's picture K3 shows a small boat calmly passing through the eye of the new pneumonia storm. It looks as if it is completely cut off from the dangerous epidemic in China, but it is constantly buffeted by information and public opinion about one's own destiny.
当病毒在武汉恣意横行的时候，我和家人登上了K3，这是一趟从中国奔往莫斯科的列车，我们憧憬着这趟横跨亚欧的旅行，并不太清楚发生在那座城的事有那么严重。
As the virus raged through Wuhan, my family and I boarded the K3, a train from China to Moscow, and we expected the trip across Asia and Europe to be less clear about the severity of what happened in that city.
与此同时，可可握着一束淡紫色的雏菊登上K3列车。
Meanwhile, cocoa boarded the K3 train holding a bunch of lilac daisies.
她用餐巾纸把面前那块有些污浊的车窗玻璃擦了擦了好几遍，随后把雏菊插了上去。
She wiped the dirty window of the car in front of her several times with a napkin and then inserted the daisies.
“到时候外面会有雪和白桦林，哇塞，拍照美爆。
"There will be snow and birch trees out there, hulking and snapping pictures.
”现实中的旅途，不总像电影中那般欢乐无忧。
The journey in real life is not always as happy as it is in the movies.
/ 电影《囧妈》可可是我在登上K3之后遇见的一个上海女孩，她手捧雏菊的照片，是我在K3列车上拍摄的第一张照片。
But I met a Shanghai girl after boarding K3, holding a photo of a daisy, my first on a K3 train.
只是按下快门的瞬间，我并没有想到接下来的72小时中，手里的相机再无机会见证那些来自俄苏文学的浪漫想象如何变得生动丰满，但无意中记录下一场真实的“奥德赛”。
Just the moment I pressed the shutter, I didn't think that for the next 72 hours my camera would have no chance to witness how the romantic images from Russian and Soviet literature would become vivid and full, but unwittingly recorded the next real Odyssey.
1月22日20时10分，K3次列车准点停靠在中蒙边境车站二连站。
On 22 January, at 2010 hours, the K3 train docked punctually at the Second Company Station of the China-Mongolia border station.
乘客们纷纷裹起羽绒服，冲上气温为零下十一度的站台，和绿色车身上的国徽合影留念。
Passengers wrapped their down jacket, rushed to the temperature of 11 degrees below the platform, and the green car body of the national emblem pictured.
或许是除夕将近，透过进站厅的玻璃门，能看到街道对面的商铺早早打了烊。
Perhaps it was New Year's Eve, and through the glass doors of the station-hall, the shops opposite the street were closed early.
唯一值得用相机记录的，是车站大楼一侧的“世界人民大团结万岁”霓虹灯。
The only thing worth recording with a camera is the neon sign "Long live the unity of the people of the world" on the side of the station building.
K3列车始发于北京，经乌兰巴托，开往莫斯科，是一列被誉为“中华第一长”的跨国列车。
The K3 train started in Beijing, via Ulaanbaatar and headed for Moscow. It is regarded as the "China's first long" international train.
搭上这列火车的乘客，大多是来自世界各地、渴望探索西伯利亚铁路沿线风景的游客。
Most of the passengers on the train were tourists from all over the world eager to explore the landscape along the Siberian railway.
不少旅游攻略都提到，在接下来的4个小时里，乘客们将在上述有限空间内经历边境检查、火车换轨，并于凌晨1点离开中国。
A number of travel advisories mention that in the next four hours, passengers will go through border checks, train re-orbiting and leave China at 1 a.m. within these limited spaces.
我跟着大伙儿涌入进站厅的一个便利店，本打算兑换点图格里克（蒙古国通用货币），这时几名边境检查人员拦在面前，进入洗手间的乘客也相继被清出，“请大家回车上等候。
As I followed the crowd into a convenience store in the entrance hall, intending to exchange Tugrik (Mongolia's currency), several border control officers stopped at the entrance and passengers were cleared. "Please go back to your car and wait.
”乘务员则给出更直截了当的回答：“可能走不了了。
The conductor gave a more direct answer: "Probably not.
”列车驶过遥远的雪原，却仍不能完全离开疾病的阴云。
Trains pass far away in the snow fields, but still cannot leave the clouds of disease completely.
/ 作者供图1月22日21：00K3列车里的空气仿佛凝固了撼动神经的紧张气息，从22日下午15时30分左右开始蔓延。
/ The air in the 21: 00K3 train on January 22 seemed to solidify nervous tension and spread from about 15: 30 p.m. on the 22nd.
当时，列车正行至晋蒙交界，车厢拉门处突然飘来一阵浓烈的醋味，“车上有3个武汉乘客”的消息由那些端水盆的乘务员散播开来。
As the train was on its way to the Junction of Jin-Meng, a heavy whiff of vinegar flashed from the carriage door. "There were three Wuhan passengers on board," spread by the steward who carried the basin.
而当我们满腹狐疑地从二连站月台挨个上车坐定，边检人员拿着体温检测仪探向每个人的额头。
When we got on the train one by one from the station platform, the border inspector reached into everyone's forehead with a thermometer.
很快，车厢里的紧张氛围，在一句“一人有发热症状”的提示声后骤然升级。
Soon, the tense atmosphere in the car escalated abruptly after a "one-man has fever symptoms" cue.
靠在窗边休息的乘客，都不约而同戴起了口罩。
The passengers resting by the window all wore masks at the same time.
几小时之前，K3上的乘客还以轻松口吻交流着玩“瘟疫公司”的心得，并查看彼此居住的城市是否已经“沦陷”。
Hours earlier, passengers on the K3 had relaxed their conversations about the plague company and checked to see if each other's cities had "fallen."
同样在几小时前，北京火车站还看不到明显的新型肺炎筛查行动，这个始建于光绪年间的火车站，在2020年1月22日之前的主要运营压力，依然来自于每年的春运。
Also a few hours ago, Beijing Railway Station did not see a clear new pneumonia screening, built in Guangxu railway station, the main operational pressure until January 22, 2020, still comes from the annual spring run.
空气仿佛凝固了。
The air seemed to freeze.
车厢被切分成了两个平行的空间：有组团出游的女孩翻出桌游卡牌，“狼人！狼人！”的狂笑穿透厢壁，也有乘客用含义丰富的“凉凉”一词形容眼前的境遇，书籍、手机、pad遮掩下的眉眼多少透出焦灼。
The car was cut into two parallel spaces: a group of traveling girls dug out the table game card, "Werewolves! Werewolves!" the wild laughter pierced the walls, and passengers used the word "cool" to describe the current situation, books, mobile phones, Pad hidden eyebrows more or less burning.
一个在北京工作的蒙古国女孩后来说，她原本想去探望扎门乌德的亲戚，顺便去草原“自我放空”一下，现在却担心列车会不会被限制出境、“遣返”北京，自己会不会面临隔离甚至更坏的可能性。
A Mongolian girl who worked in Beijing later said she had wanted to visit her relatives in Zamyn-Uud and had gone to the grassland to "empty herself out," but was now worried about whether the train would be restricted from leaving the country and "repatriated" to Beijing and faced the possibility of isolation or even worse.
沿途积雪的站台。
Platform of snow along the road.
/ 作者供图在K3列车滞留于铁轨上“等待处理结果”的3个多小时里，窗外车站大钟播放的《东方红》整点报时，和远处零星的鞭炮声产生交集，一种不安全感开始从车厢的细节处显现：循例关闭的厕所门前开始排队；扎堆插在过道边等待充电的手机电量逐渐“变红”，随后被“抢救”下来；几个乘客尝试用茶水炉中丧失热度的饮用水洗手，以此寻求所谓的“清洁感”；靠近站台一侧的车窗据说能看见救护车的进入，但也仅仅限于“据说”阶段。
For more than three hours while the K3 train was stuck on the track, "waiting for the result," a sense of insecurity began to emerge from the station clock's punctuation and sporadic firecrackers in the distance. A sense of insecurity began to set in front of the regularly closed toilet; several passengers tried to "clean" the windows next to the platform, reportedly seeing ambulances from the "reportedly" stage.
列车穿过森林。
The train went through the forest.
/ 作者供图1月22日22：30“把隐患带出国境去，会更麻烦”负责我所在车厢的乘务员小陆说，列车上的情况正通报给铁总、卫健委等有关部门，须有明确处理方法，方可进入换轨流程。
The situation on the train is being reported to the relevant departments such as the Railway General Administration of Health and Physical Fitness, and there is a need for clear procedures before moving on to the re-orbiting process, said Xiao Lu, the conductor in charge of my car.
但作为一个置身中国边陲的铁路工作者，他掌握的信息和我们一样有限，“出乘以后才接到通知要重视这事，现在只能观望结果。
But as a railroad worker on China's frontier, he had as little information as we did. "After the trip, he was told to take the matter seriously, and now he had to wait and see the results.
当然，要是有事发生，那也已经发生了。
Of course, if something happened, it would have happened.
”小陆说。
"said Lu.
他不停地用“没事儿”安抚周围人的情绪，有乘客提议给他拿个口罩戴上，他没答应，说“不想引发恐慌情绪”。
He kept trying to calm those around him by saying "nothing's wrong." Passengers offered him a mask, but he didn't say, "I don't want to cause panic."
和小陆聊天的过程中，他一直刷着手机。
While chatting with Xiao Lu, he kept brushing his mobile phone.
对工作状态下必须将手机交出的乘务员而言，这个举动显得不同寻常，“也是师傅开恩，我们这份工作，实在太难。
"It was an unusual move for a flight attendant who had to hand over his mobile phone while he was at work." It was a gift from the master, "he said.
”车窗外的风景对旅客而言或许足够新鲜，在乘务员眼中多少有些单调。
The view outside the car window might be fresh enough for the traveler, but it was more or less monotonous in the conductor's eyes.
/ 作者供图小陆坦言，与这列1996年德国生产的煤动力“原版绿皮车”——K3相伴的十年中，加煤、铲冰、打扫卫生、协助中蒙俄三国工作人员进行边检，甚至眼前的秩序维持，都是他的分内职责。
The writer confesses that it was his job to add coal, scoop ice, clean up the sanitation, assist the staff of China, Mongolia and Russia to inspect the border and even maintain order in the ten years that accompanied the 1996 German coal-powered "original green leather car" - K3.
他曾试过夏天在没有冷气且空间逼仄的车厢内“蒸桑拿”，也见过过极端天气下自窗缝卷到过道地面的积雪和积沙。
He has tried to "steam saunas" in summer cars with no air conditioning and cramped spaces, and has seen snow and sand drift from window cracks to the floor in extreme weather.
他认为，任务结束后近一个月的调休，根本不足以弥合往返十三天的辛劳，至于那些人们印象中“诗和远方”的代名词——人际罕至的草原、森林和贝加尔湖，留给他的更深刻印象是零下40度的低温，以及长期的信号不足带来的困扰。
Nearly a month off from work, he argues, is not enough to make up for 13 days of hard work, while the familiar pronoun "poetry and distance" - untouchable grasslands, forests and Lake Baikal - left him more impressed with temperatures below minus 40 degrees and with chronic signal deficiencies.
“徐峥的《囧妈》不是能看了吗？又该有特多像你们这样花钱买罪受的主儿被坑了。
"Isn't it possible to see Zheng Zheng's" Jung Ma "? There should be a lot of people like you who spend money to buy the sinful Lord's pit.
”电影《囧妈》中纷乱的K3车厢。
The tumultuous K3 in the movie "Jommy."
/ 电影《囧妈》听小陆讲述时，K3列车上的乘客本能地把他的经历置于新型肺炎的语境下考虑，不同观点几经交锋，形成了一个初步结论——设备老旧，清洁条件有限的列车里潜伏着滋生病菌的危险，巨大的地域跨度也明显增加了行程中的不确定因素，不过，车厢接口处灌入的寒风仍能保证空气流通。
While the passengers on the K3 train instinctively placed their experiences in the context of a new type of pneumonia, and came to a preliminary conclusion - old equipment, limited cleaning conditions lurking in trains with germs, huge geographical span, but the cold wind at the junction can still ensure air circulation.
“比起高铁、飞机的密闭空间还是好了一些。
"It's a little better than the high-speed rail and airplanes.
”“只能说K3见识过各种各样的状况，也包括眼下的一切。
"" I can only say K3 has seen all kinds of things, including all that is going on now.
但把隐患带出国境去，会更麻烦。
But taking the hidden dangers out of the country would be more troublesome.
当机立断限制出境其实是最有效的办法。
A quick decision to restrict exit is actually the most effective way.
”一个将90年代列车大劫案称为“亲身经历其实和电视剧里差不多”的年长列车员如此感叹。
An elderly conductor who described the '90s train robbery as "something akin to what happened on TV shows" lamented.
23时43分，列车突然开始移动，像迸发出一声沉闷而令人兴奋的咳嗽，缓缓进入换轨车间。
At 23: 43, the train suddenly began to move, like a dull and exciting cough, slowly into the re-rail workshop.
7名湖北籍及近期有过探访史的乘客已证实被劝告下车，进入了二连浩特市进行隔离。
Seven passengers of Hubei nationality and recent history of visits have been advised to disembark and enter Erlianhot for quarantine.
乘友小灯后来告诉我，这其中包括与三名武汉籍乘客同包厢的一名重庆籍乘客，与此同时，一名在外地工作、生活的女孩，因为护照签发地是湖北，也不得不放弃出境。
A friend of mine later told me that this included a Chongqing passenger who was in a box with three Wuhan passengers, while a girl who worked and lived in another city had to leave because her passport was issued in Hubei Province.
关于这7名“被劝退”乘客的命运，我听到过两个截然不同的版本。
I have heard two very different versions of the fate of the seven passengers who were "persuaded to retreat."
来自隔壁车厢的列车员说：“发热的那个37度3，已经从严处理了。
The conductor from the next car said, "The heat of the 37C has been strictly dealt with.
其实都挺好，问题不大。
It's all good. It's not a big problem.
”但小灯通过一个“驴友”群了解到的情况是，发热的武汉籍乘客已被当作疑似病例单独隔离，剩下的6人虽然住在一起，但也不能离开集体宿舍。
But what the lamp learned from a group of donkey friends was that the feverish Wuhan passengers had been isolated as suspected cases and that the remaining six could not leave the dormitories, although they lived together.
余下的乘客并不确定是否和三名武汉籍乘客在餐车等地发生过接触，类似“都这样了，能不能不要出来乱跑”“可真不想成为新闻主角”的讨论开始在车厢里“翻滚”。
The rest of the passengers were unsure whether there had been any contact with three Wuhan-based passengers, such as in the dining car, which began rolling in the car.
换轨时，来自车厢底部的剧烈撞击，则成为压抑情绪下唯一的正能量来源。
During the change of rail, the violent impact from the bottom of the car becomes the only positive energy source under the pressure.
长长的时刻表。
A long timetable.
/ 作者供图1月23日中午13：30“真要确诊还跑得了你们？来瓶伏特加，消消毒”23日凌晨3时53分，经过与新型肺炎相关的排查、登记、通报、劝返，K3次列车离开二连浩特口岸，“扎进”蒙古国的茫茫戈壁中，标有“中华人民共和国”字样的巨大“国门”开始隐遁于身后的黑暗中。
At 3: 53 am, the K3 train left Erlianhot Pass and "dived into" Mongolia's huge Gobi with the words "People's Republic of China" in the dark behind them.
整个排查和登记的过程，持续了约7小时。
The entire screening and registration process lasted approximately seven hours.
等到扎门乌德站蒙方边检人员上车，包厢门口出现17年未曾见到的隔离服、护目镜、3MN95口罩和乳胶手套。
When Mongolian border guards got on the bus at Zamyn-Uud station, there were 17-year-old paraphernalia, goggles, 3MN 95 masks and latex gloves.
入境卡和护照交到对方手中时，对方用中文连催促了三遍：“快！”而一个多小时前，手机推送中刚刚出现“武汉市于当日10时起关闭离汉通道”的“封城”新闻。
When the cards and passports were handed over to each other, they were urged three times in Chinese: "Quick!" More than an hour ago, the mobile phone push had just appeared in the "Wuhan city closed Han corridor from 10: 00 on the same day" news "closed.
在餐车里见到香港籍乘客Charles时，已经是1月23日13时30分左右了。
It was around 13: 30 on January 23 when Charles, a Hong Kong passenger, was seen in the dining car.
他喜欢坐火车旅行，K3的这趟旅程自己心心念念了很久。
He loved to travel by train, and the K3's trip was a long one for himself.
“搭高铁去北京亦都经过武汉，好似好英雄咁，但系你话点算？”（坐高铁去北京都要经过武汉，好像特别英雄，但你说又能怎么办呢？）“但系你话点算”，这话特别贴合“K3共同体”当时的处境。
To take the high-speed railway to Beijing is to go through Wuhan, it seems like a good hero, but you have to enumerate it. To go to Beijing by high-speed railway is to pass Wuhan, like a special hero.
阳光把窗外的戈壁映得发亮，路边可见过坡的马和骆驼，以及冻毙动物的尸体，宛若置身雪国。
The sun glittered the gobi out of the window, and the sidewalk was lined with horses and camels, and the carcasses of frozen animals, as if they were in the snow.
餐车里的四个北京口音乘客开了一瓶伏特加：“戴口罩有什么用啊？真要确诊还跑得了你们？来瓶伏特加，消消毒。
Four Beijing-accented passengers in the diner opened a bottle of vodka: "What's the point of wearing a mask? Can you get it? A bottle of vodka and disinfect it."
”1月25日10：10从“飞来横祸”到“佛系谈笑”1月25日10时10分，我收到同包厢乘友阿紫发来的消息：“我看到新闻报了，那个二连浩特的确诊了。
From "flying around" to "talking and laughing" at 10: 10 a.m. on January 25, I received a message from my friend Ai Zi, who was in the box: "I saw the news paper, the diagnosis of Erlianhaote.
你们注意点。
Watch your step.
”我和阿紫是24日下午在贝加尔湖畔的伊尔库茨克站分手的。
Purple and I parted at Irkutsk Station on Lake Baikal on the afternoon of the 24th.
车门正对伊尔库茨克站绿白相间的小楼打开时，近零下十二度的新鲜空气灌入鼻腔，令人兴奋，仿佛禁闭被解除。
As the green-and-white wing of Irkutsk Station opened, the fresh air, nearly twelve degrees below zero, poured into the nasal cavity, exciting as if the confinement had been lifted.
此前的2夜1天，我们在过境蒙古国期间全程未被允许下车，乌兰巴托站的检疫人员对车轮和垃圾桶喷洒了消毒药物。
Two nights earlier, we were not allowed to get off the bus during our transit through Mongolia. Quarantine officers at Ulaanbaatar station sprayed disinfectant on the wheels and garbage cans.
而在蒙俄边境城市多卓尔内，俄方边检人员依例应对我们的随身物品进行查验，此次却只是站在远处指挥我们自行展示。
In the border city of Dodzorne, Russian border officials should routinely inspect our belongings, but this time they only stood at a distance and instructed us to display them.
让阿紫务必保重身体后，我连上网，在《人民日报》发布的《内蒙古新增1例新型肺炎确诊病例 累计2例》新闻中，确认了消息的真实性（锡林郭勒盟二连浩特市疑似病例确诊，为锡林郭勒盟报告首例确诊病例）。
I confirmed the veracity of the news in "Two New Cases of Confirmed New Pneumonia in Inner Mongolia," published by People's Daily (the first confirmed case was reported for the first time in the suspected case in Erlianhot city of Syringuele).
略出乎意料的是，如果说在22日“惊魂7小时”中占主流的舆论，是将7名乘客被边境“劝退”的经历定义为“飞来横祸”，并担忧类似这种“飞来横祸”的降临可能导致自己价值数千元的在俄后续行程化为泡影，那么乘友们此时已将报备、隔离视作义务，回应也显得平静。
Strangely surprisingly, if the dominant public opinion on the 22nd was to define the experience of the seven passengers being "persuaded to retreat" across the border as "flying around" and worried that a "catastrophe" like this could paralyze their thousands of dollars worth of follow-on trips to Russia, friends would now regard reporting and quarantining as a duty and the response calm.
小灯所在的“驴友”群中出现一个帖子。
A post appeared in the group of "donkey friends" where the lamp was located.
原来，那名持湖北签发护照被隔离的女孩在某旅行论坛发布了“求救信”。
Originally, the girl with Hubei issued a passport isolation in a travel forum issued a "message for help."
截至2月27日下午，这封“求救信”在微信上的阅读量已经超过五万。
By the afternoon of February 27, more than 50, 000 copies of the message had been read.
“求救信”用“受困国境线”“强制抽血检查”“把我们当犯人”“海关一杆子打死”等表达描述了自己下车后的处境，但遭到评论区“以大局为重”的激烈反驳。
"SOS" by "stranded state borders", "forced blood tests" "we are criminals" and "customs a pole kill" and other expressions described their situation after getting off the bus, but the commentary area "focus on the overall situation."
以此为鉴，我们简单讨论出一个“应对方针”：调整心态，坦然接受一切安排处理；从25日起“自我隔离”，尽量减少外出，不再去餐车吃饭，对自己和他人负责。
Using this as a guide, we briefly discuss a "coping strategy": adjust your mindset and be open to all arrangements; "insulate yourself" from 25 onwards, minimize going out, stop eating in the dining car, and be accountable to yourself and others.
列车上的年夜饭。
New Year's dinner on the train.
/ 作者供图事实上，以22日“惊魂7小时”为起点，车厢走道已经变身为一个“另类公共空间”。
In fact, the carriageway has become an "alternative public space," starting with the 22 "7-hour scare."
乘友们在此交换共享的，由最初的零食、转换插头、信号良好可供上网接收信息的电子设备延展到那些“佛系谈笑”。
Friends here exchange and share the initial snacks, switching plugs, good-signal electronic equipment for receiving information online to those "buddha chatting and laughing."
与此同时，大家也开始用姓名互相称呼。
At the same time, people began to address each other by first names.
1月25日12：30K3列车，驶过暴风眼的一叶小舟乘务员老林是在25日下午加入《囧妈》的观影大军的。
On January 25, at 12: 30K3, Laolin, a steward of a small boat passing through the eye of the storm, joined the movie-watching crew of "Jommy" on the afternoon of January 25.
彼时，他眯着眼睛站在包厢门口，费力凝望iPad屏幕中的徐峥在过于精致整洁的“K3包厢”中奔走：“这哪儿啊？K3？假！怎么能没我呢！”哄笑声中，他顺势坐在了铺上。
Then, squinting his eyes at the door of the box, he peered intently at Xu Zheng, who was struggling through the neatly neatened "K3 box" on the iPad screen: "Where is that? K3? False! How can I be without me!"
这是我们与乘务员的第一次打开心扉的对话。
It was our first open conversation with the flight attendant.
在此之前，或许是职业素养使然，他们表现得过于“置身事外”—— 从22日晚排查出一例武汉籍发热乘客到确诊新闻发布，尽管伴随着明显的面部肌肉抽动，和瞬间沉默的对视，但从小陆与他师傅老贾口中说出的“没事”“坏了”“听天由命”里，你几乎感觉不到明显的情绪起伏。
Before that, perhaps because of professional training, they were too "out of touch" - from a hot Wuhan passenger on the evening of the 22nd to a confirmed press release, though with obvious facial twitching and instant silent eye-to-mouth "nothing" or "bad" or "resigned."
但老林并非不害怕。
But Lao Lin is not unafraid.
出乘前一日，铺天盖地的新型肺炎疫情通报已经让他产生了担忧。
The day before the trip, he was already worried about a spate of new outbreaks of pneumonia.
直至看到那名“脸色明显不好看”的发热女乘客被带离车厢时，他有些被惊到，喝了好几口酒。
Until he saw the feverish passenger, who was "noticeably unattractive," taken out of the car, he was alarmed and drank several drinks.
这个偏方色彩浓重的行为，是他目前能想到的唯一消毒手段。
This highly coloured exercise was the only disinfection he could think of at the moment.
根据他的回忆，同事们出乘时没有作特殊准备，车上条件也有限，居家急救物品不齐全，随身携带的“防护装备”，还是上车前女儿塞给他的一打口罩，以及特意去雍和宫替他求来的一枚本命年平安符。
Colleagues, he recalls, were not prepared for the trip, the conditions were limited, emergency items were inadequate, "protective gear" was on hand, a dozen masks had been thrust into his daughter's hand before they got on the bus, and a lifetime peace of mind had been brought to Yonghe Palace specifically for him.
把平安符挂到他脖子上的时候，女儿叮嘱：“爸，平平安安回来啊！”老林说，与高铁、动车相比，绿皮火车已属于被极度边缘化的铁路出行方式。
Hanging on his neck, his daughter said: "Dad, come back safe and sound!" Lao Lin said, compared with high-speed rail, train, green has been a very marginalized way of railway travel.
但K3因维系着1950年代以来中、蒙、俄三国的传统友谊而被赋予特殊政治意义，不能停运，即使在2003年“非典”那样的特殊时期，也必须以空驶形式正常发车。
But the K3, which has been given special political significance because of the traditional friendship between China, Mongolia and Russia since the 1950s, cannot be stopped. Even in a special period like SARS in 2003, it must start normally by air.
他却很想知道我们为什么非得在阖家团圆之际“上这么远的地方晃悠”。
He wondered why we had to "hang out so far" in the process of family reunion.
乘友们历数春节回家有可能面对的不自在，也提到把十几天假期耗费在饭桌上，有点可惜。
Friends enumerate the Spring Festival home may face the discomfort, but also referred to the 10-day holiday on the table, a little pity.
后来，小灯突然感叹，人活着有时很像置身于进攻队列里的士兵，总觉得有老兵挡在前面替你承受枪林弹雨的危险，可以任性或走神儿，甚至随便责备他们，直到某一刻，才会意识到面前空了。
Then suddenly the little lamp sighed that life was sometimes like a soldier in an attack line, and that old soldiers were always in front of you and could stand the fire and fire for you, wayward or absent-minded, or even blame them casually, until a moment, before realizing that it was empty.
老林感同身受。
Lao Lin sympathizes.
“女儿平时总说我不理解年轻人生活方式，和我有代沟。
"Daughters always say I don't understand the way young people live, and I have a generation gap.
我想什么代沟啊，不就是‘把人带沟里’吗？”“刚才也向你们虚心学习‘年轻人的生活方式’了，我觉得老一辈说的话确实不一定对，但他们都是苦日子过来的，看问题有自己的思路。
I think what generation gap, is not 'take people into the ditch'? "" I have just humbly learned from you 'young people's way of life', I think the older generation is not really right, but they are all bitter days, to see the problem has its own way of thinking.
以后多陪陪他们，多听听他们在想些什么吧，加强理解嘛！”而当剧情中提及徐伊万父母在新疆生产建设兵团的定情之作—— 塔科夫斯基电影《伊万的童年》，一直让人觉得内向的乘友思琪突然把手机里保存的奥列格·扬科夫斯基（曾与塔可夫斯基合作过《乡愁》《镜子》的苏联男演员）涂鸦墙图片推到我面前，说这是她一定要来俄罗斯的理由，“不知道能不能实现”。
When the plot mentioned Xu Ivan's parents' masterpiece in the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps - Ivan's Childhood, the introverted passenger Ski suddenly pushed graffiti wall pictures in front of me, saying it was the reason she had to come to Russia, "I don't know if it would happen.
“以前读俄苏文学，老觉得命运被描写得又晦涩又沉重，现在也有点理解了。
"When I read Russian and Soviet literature, I always thought my destiny was described as obscure and heavy, and now I understand it a little.
不过下车以后要是被直接遣送、隔离也不坏，一是大家有个照应，二是人要叶落归根啊。
