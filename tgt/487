Source: Tencent News "Potential" column by Zhang Jun raising money from cities such as north shangguang to show how difficult it is for doctors and nurses to deliver masks and protective clothing to doctors and nurses.
包括企业募捐、公益基金向社会公开筹款，这笔善款金额起码有数十亿之多。
Including corporate fund-raising, public fund-raising to the community, this amount of money at least billions.
另外一方面，来自湖北武汉医院的声音却不断提醒我们：物资短缺。
On the other hand, the voice from Wuhan Hospital in Hubei Province reminds us of the shortage of materials.
来自武汉医院的视频显示，多个医院的医生为了节省一次性的防护服一天不喝水，口罩也一直处于短缺状态，甚至除夕夜医生和护士的午餐是简单的方便面和饼干。
According to a video from Wuhan Hospital, doctors in many hospitals have been running out of water to save disposable protective clothing for a day, and face masks have been in short supply. Even on New Year's Eve, doctors and nurses eat simple instant noodles and biscuits.
一面是声势浩大的驰援行动，一面是武汉乃至湖北地区的医疗物资告急，这样的反差来源于何处？不少接受采访的人士都表示，现在不愁钱，但拿到物资、把物资送到前方充满曲折。
On the one hand, a huge rescue operation, on the one hand, Wuhan and even Hubei region medical supplies in urgent need, on the other hand, such a contrast? Many interviewees said that there is no shortage of money, but to get supplies, to the forward full tortuous.
深夜，我发现遇到了骗子“骗子甚至比我们还专业，盖章、签字一应俱全。
Late at night, I found a liar "cheater is even more professional than us, stamp, sign everything.
”一位公益基金会秘书长说。
"said a charitable foundation's general secretary.
他在2020年1月26日晚9点半抽出空隙接受了我们的采访，电话中一直气喘吁吁。
He gave us an interview at 9: 30 p.m. on January 26, 2020, when he was out of breath.
此时新型冠状病毒舆论发酵5日，公益组织员工几乎忙得连轴转。
At this point the new coronavirus public opinion fermentation 5 days, the public welfare organizations almost busy staff rotation.
“春晚那天晚上捐款最疯狂，各个频道募捐额都在指数级上涨。
"The gala was the most frantic on the night of the gala, with all channels raising money exponentially.
”一位在线募捐平台项目负责人说，近几日仅网上募捐额就至少达到10亿规模，历史罕见。
One online fundraising platform project director said the amount raised online in recent days alone had reached at least one billion, a rarity.
而来自企业方的公开捐助，单以互联网公司为例，超过25亿元。
Public donations from companies, for example, exceed 2.5 billion yuan.
“你看才短短几天时间，是相当恐怖的。
"You look at it in a matter of days. It's pretty scary.
”他们平台直到凌晨两三点每秒钟还有几十个用户在捐款。
Dozens of users donate to their platforms until two or three in the morning.
据他介绍，互联网慈善募捐2018年全年的募捐总额在32亿左右；而一般性自然灾害的募捐额为数百到数千万；对比之下，这次善款规模庞大，并且仍在增加，不少人在平台上问，这个项目捐满了，还有没有其他项目能捐。
Internet philanthropy raised about 3.2 billion dollars in 2018, compared with millions to tens of millions of dollars for ordinary natural disasters, he said, adding that many people on the platform asked if the project had been donated and whether other projects could be donated.
一边是迫切的捐助者，而另一边，募捐平台在筹集完资金后，资金直接流向各个基金会，由基金会做执行。
On the one hand, there are urgent donors, and on the other hand, after the fund-raising platform has raised funds, the funds flow directly to the foundations, which carry them out.
基金会的首要任务是，最大化利用这笔钱采购物资，运输到疫区前方。
The Foundation's first task is to maximize the use of this money to purchase goods, transport to the front of the epidemic area.
其中，采购和运输是关键点。
Among them, procurement and transportation are key points.
现在不缺钱，真正稀缺的是物资。
There is no shortage of money; what is really scarce is supplies.
“采购就是八仙过海，各显神通了。
"Procurement is the Eight Immortals across the sea.
”上述人士称。
'said the man.
这位公益基金会秘书长在微信里置顶了15个物料采购供应商群，接连3日都在疯抢货源、价格轰炸中度过。
The pro bono secretary-general put up a group of 15 suppliers in his micro-letter and spent the next three days scrambling for supplies and bombarding prices.
挂完电话，他的手机又显示几百条未读提醒，每天到忙到凌晨两点之后。
After hanging up, his cell phone showed hundreds of unread reminders every day until after 2 a.m.
就在全民皆兵的关头，他没有想到，自己差点被骗走56万元。
In the national army at the juncture, he did not think that he was almost cheated 56, 000 yuan.
行骗路径看起来猖狂。
The path of deception seems audacious.
1月25日，有人以某航空公司资产管理部的名义，接触这家基金会，并称自己有一批近20万只N95口罩的储存物资——其中12万只愿意捐赠，7万只需要购买，不过表明是中标价格的“半价出售”。
On January 25, the foundation was approached on behalf of an airline's Asset Management Department, which said it had a stockpile of nearly 200,000 N95 masks - 120,000 willing to donate and 70,000 only to purchase, but indicating a "half-price sale" of the winning price.
对方提供了一系列看起来正规的航空公司文件。
The other side provides a series of seemingly regular airline documents.
行骗者提供的物资出售说明，供图/接受采访的公益基金一份名为《XX航空股份有限公司资产管理部紧急物资出售说明》的文件显示，这些口罩是由飞机部转交，用于申请武汉冠状病毒疫情期间，社会人员团体申请采购公司多余库存口罩。
A description of the sale of the goods provided by the fraudster and a document for the public interest fund pictured / interviewed, entitled "Emergency Material Sale Instructions of the Asset Management Department of XX Airways Limited," shows that the masks were forwarded by the Aircraft Department for use during the application period of the Wuhan coronavirus epidemic.
口罩系3M的医用防护口罩，文件配有中标时间和编号，以及航空公司印章。
The mask is a 3M medical mask with a winning time and serial number, as well as the airline seal.
“他们中标采购的标书上是16块，半价相当于8块钱。
"The bid they won was 16 dollars, half the price being eight dollars.
”上述秘书长说。
"said the secretary-general.
采购这批货总价56万。
The goods were purchased for a total price of 560,000.
“我们下意识认为航空公司储备的物资一定是符合标准的。
"We subconsciously assumed that the airline's stock must be up to standard.
”更令基金会心动的是，对方承诺将由航空公司直接空运这批口罩到达武汉。
To the fund's delight, the other side promised to airlift the masks directly to Wuhan by air.
“不得用于盈利，所有产生的一切运输费用由本公司承担 。
"It shall not be used for profit. All transportation expenses incurred shall be borne by the Company.
”他们在文件中信誓旦旦写道。
In the document they swore to themselves.
行骗者提供的物资出售合同，供图/接受采访的公益基金事后来看，文件有几处破绽。
The contract for the sale of goods provided by the fraudster, which the public interest fund interviewed had in retrospect revealed several flaws in the document.
第一，他们提供的合同抬头，把航空公司名称写错了一个字；第二，在合同正文中，他们把甲乙方多次错用；第三，对方留下的邮箱经测试不能接收邮件。
First, they provided the contract head, the name of the airline misspelled one word; secondly, in the body of the contract, they used Party A repeatedly by mistake; and thirdly, the mailbox left behind by the other party could not be accepted after testing.
为了加强信任度，行骗者特意在提供的物资出售说明下方，印有“抄送：XX董事长、XX总经理、XX总会计师、行政管理部、董事会办公室”字样，这些人都是该航空公司高层真实姓名。
To reinforce trust, the fraudster deliberately printed the words "Cc: XX Chairman, XX General Manager, XX General Accountant, Ministry of Administration, Office of the Board of Directors" below the description of the sale of the goods provided, all of which are real names of the airline's top executives.
一般而言，抄送只会出现在邮件而非正文中，这么做有几分掩耳盗铃，但是在分秒必争的疫区支援背景下，组织者来不及多想。
Generally speaking, copy will only appear in the mail, not in the text, which is a bit of a cover-up, but the organizers will not have time to think about it in the context of a pandemic support situation.
“你只要交十几万定金就可以把货全拿走，他们是通过空运直接到武汉，那多好啊！我们就赶快谈啊。
If only you could take all the goods with a deposit of more than ten thousand dollars, and they would fly directly to Wuhan.
”秘书长表现急切。
The Secretary-General was eager.
直到签合同的最后一刻，这家基金会的法务发现，收款人不是航空公司。
At the last minute of the contract, the foundation's solicitor found that the recipient was not the airline.
他们按公司名查询，这家公司已于2019年中注销。
They inquired by company name and the company was written off in mid-2019.
这时基金会负责人才提起警惕。
Then the head of the foundation was alerted.
他又从其他途径得知，这个团队还在向其他公益组织同时开价，并让他们缴纳定金。
He also learned from other sources that the team was charging other charities at the same time and asking them to pay a down payment.
据这位秘书长了解，这些骗子最早盯准留学生群体，因为留学生在支援前线中表现踊跃，但后来可能消耗不了供给，他们又盯上了基金会。
According to the Secretary-General, the cheats were the first to target the international student community, which had been active on the front lines but might not be able to consume supplies, and they turned to foundations.
目前该基金会已经报案。
The Foundation has now reported the incident.
截至25日晚，基金会就等发货消息对外发布通稿，没想到出了意外。
As of the evening of the 25th, the Foundation on the delivery of news release circulars, did not expect an accident.
“没办法，在深夜之前我都没有办法确认他是骗子。
"I can't help it. I can't identify him as a liar until late at night.
”上述秘书长称，“抬价我都能忍受，顶多我不选择，但是摆明上来骗的就太恶劣了。
"I can bear to raise the price," said the secretary-general. "I don't choose at most, but it's too bad to lie.
”他希望这起事件能引起其他公益组织及人士注意。
He hopes the incident will attract the attention of other pro bono groups and people.
不能用众人的善意助长了坏人的气焰。
The good will of all must not inflame the bad.
一觉醒来，20万口罩没有了罗然（化名）在公益基金任职，这天他刚谈定20万只口罩，已经打款。
As soon as he woke up, 200,000 masks were no longer working for a charity fund, and he had just negotiated 200,000 masks, which he had already paid for.
凌晨2点睡下，他总觉得不踏实，夜里4点醒来打开手机，不料工厂临时发微信通知：“口罩被相关部门扣下了，不让出售了。
He always feels unsure when he goes to bed at 2: 00 a.m. and wakes up to open his cell phone at 4: 00 p. m. only to find that the factory has temporarily issued a warning: "The mask has been withheld by the relevant authorities and will not be sold
”仅仅两个小时，一大批物资泡汤。
In just two hours, a lot of material was ruined.
这批口罩均为一次性医用口罩，每个1元，目前该型号口罩正常的价格浮动在6毛到1块5之间。
These masks are disposable medical masks, each worth $1, and the normal price of the mask currently fluctuates between $6 and $1. 5.
他怀疑这批物资是抬价卖给了别人，但不能确定。
He suspected, but could not be certain, that the shipment had been sold at a higher price.
“动不动几万个被别人截走了，有一些甚至付了钱的。
"Tens of thousands of people have been cut off, and some have even paid for it.
”一位参与驰援的民间组织发起人说，他们刚从一家台州厂商预订了上万个口罩，结果临时通知没有了。
A promoter of a civil society organization involved in the rescue said it had ordered tens of thousands of masks from a Taizhou manufacturer, only to be given short notice.
采购越来越难是大家共同感受到的。
The increasing difficulty of procurement was felt by all.
“我们一路搜集的过程中，价格越来越高，已经到了百分之一两百的涨幅了。
"In the process of our collection, the price has gone up more and more. It has gone up by 200%.
”一家创业公司CEO佘锡伟说，他们从过年前两天开始动员公司力量搜寻物资，其中有一家谈好的N95级别口罩，预定采购价是5块，然后在半个小时后就变成13块。
She Siah, CEO of a start-up company, said they had been mobilising the company to search for supplies two days before the start of the year, including a negotiated N95 mask with a purchase price of five dollars and then turned into 13 after half an hour.
该类型口罩他们的采购价格在5元至15元之间，他们采购了20万以上口罩。
They purchased between $5 and $15 for this type of mask, and they purchased more than 200,000.
据罗然介绍，现在买到的基本是N95级别口罩，距真正的医用标准有一定差距，纯医用口罩由于根本找不到货源他们已经接近放弃了，只能寄希望于政府机构统一调配。
According to Luo Ran, now buy the basic N95 level mask, from the real medical standards there is a certain gap, pure medical masks because they can not find a source of supplies they have been close to giving up, can only hope that government agencies unified deployment.
N95级别口罩一般的采购价是7-8元，波动高点为11-12元，现在达到16元也算是合理范围。
The normal purchase price of N95 mask is 7-8 yuan, fluctuating high of 11-12 yuan, now 16 yuan is a reasonable range.
但是有人把该型号口罩加价卖到25-35元。
But someone sold the mask at a premium of $25 to $35.
“加价挺夸张的，我都不敢跟你说。
"It's an exaggeration to raise the price. I can't even tell you.
”而一次性医用口罩正常价格为7-8毛，现在贵的卖到了每个2.5元。
Disposable medical masks, which normally cost between 7 and 8 cents, are now sold for 2.5 yuan each.
上述公益基金秘书长称，目前市面上不存在太多讨价还价，基本都是一口价，商家根本不愁卖，只要有货，“瞬间秒没”。
According to the Secretary-General of the public interest fund, there is not much bargaining on the market, the basic price is not worried to sell, as long as goods, "instantaneous seconds do not.
以往公益基金做项目，只要制定好计划，提前告诉供应商需要多少就行了，而这次是“在抢购，就看谁下手快”。
In the past, pro bono funds did projects, as long as a good plan, told suppliers in advance of the number of needs, and this is "in the rush, depending on who started quickly."
针对商家在疫情面前的涨价行为，国家市场监管总局在1月25日发布公告称，要求加强口罩、消毒杀菌用品、抗病毒药品及相关医疗器械等防疫用品市场价格监管。
The State Administration of Market Supervision issued a notice on January 25 calling for the regulation of market prices for epidemic prevention products such as masks, disinfectant products, antiviral drugs and related medical devices.
“国家肯定管控了，但这属于人性，没办法。
"The state certainly controls it, but it's human and there's nothing we can do.
”上述秘书长说，“人性我们是没办法去说三道四的。
"Human nature is something we can't talk about," said the secretary-general.
”佘锡伟说，他们从26日起已经在市场上找不到货。
She said they had not been able to find goods in the market since 26.
他们联系了诸多口罩厂家，即使有，价格也相当之高——N95级别口罩售价30元。
They contacted a number of mask makers and, if they did, the price was pretty high -- $30 for the N95 mask.
还有一次，他们买了一次性医用口罩，大年夜凌晨1点到货，同事们一起把50多箱口罩搬下来。
On another occasion, they bought a disposable medical mask and arrived at 1: 00 am on New Year's Eve.
没想到这批2元/个的口罩质量太差，和厂家给他们看的实物完全不同，他们当即决定退货。
I did not expect that the quality of these 2 yuan / individual masks is too bad, and manufacturers to show them the real thing is completely different, they immediately decided to return the goods.
对方不屑一顾地说，你们不要很多人抢着要，在地铁站可以卖出3倍价格，他那天已经卖出50万个了。
'You don't want a lot of people competing for it, 'he says scornfully.' You can sell three times as much at the subway station. He sold half a million units that day.
佘锡伟买到了质量低劣的口罩，决定退货。
She bought a low-quality mask and decided to return it.
“我们不想给他们发这种国难财，这种行为肯定不能放纵他们。
"We don't want to give them this kind of national wealth, and we certainly can't indulge them in such behavior.
”采访中，不少人都透露类似想法，另一位参与驰援的互联网业界人士称，他们把离谱价格的货源都过滤掉了，只采购10元以内的货源。
A number of people revealed similar thoughts in the interview, and another Internet professional involved said that they had filtered out outrageous sources and purchased only supplies for less than $10.
口罩尚且短缺，更别说防护服。
There is still a shortage of face masks, let alone protective clothing.
“基本上到现在也没买到过。
"" Basically, I haven't bought one so far.
”佘锡伟称。
She said.
罗然也明确说，市面上很难找到真正符合标准的防护服，厂家本身非常少，并且慈善机构以前没有接触过，“坦白说我不敢买”。
Rowan also made it clear that it was difficult to find truly standard protective clothing, that manufacturers themselves were few, and that charities had no previous contact and "frankly I dare not buy".
他好不容易找到一批5000规模的防护服，只带帽子不带鞋，售价30多块一套。
He managed to find a 5,000-size wardrobe with a hat and no shoes and sold for more than 30 dollars.
但由于该防护服是出口商品，而且来自原材料厂商，未进行二次加工，根本进不了医院。
However, as the suit is an export commodity and comes from a raw material manufacturer, it is not reprocessed and cannot enter the hospital at all.
他们寻求折中方案——送给疫区环卫工人。
They are looking for a compromise - for sanitation workers in affected areas.
目前防护服的采购只能依靠有更强渠道能力的大基金、大机构。
At present, the procurement of protective clothing can only rely on the ability to have stronger channels of large funds, large institutions.
混乱中，甚至有人冒充医院拦截物资。
In the chaos, people even passed off as hospitals to intercept supplies.
“捐助的注意，有打我院招牌截流物资的。
"The attention of donation, have hit our hospital signboard intercept material.
”一位医护人员在救助群里发出号召。
"A paramedic called out from among the rescuers.
佘锡伟对接的医院也接到一通询问物流信息的奇怪电话：“我真的担心救命的物资被冒领。
The hospital where she docked also received a strange phone call asking for logistics information: "I'm really worried that life-saving supplies will be stolen.
”谁来分配？疫情爆发后，武汉市新冠肺炎防控指挥部提出，所有物资需要由他们统一调配。
After the outbreak, Wuhan Xinguan Pneumonia Prevention and Control Command proposed that all materials needed to be unified by them.
目前大多数公益机构在找到货源后，会和当地红十字会或慈善总会联系，询问是否需要该物资，以及由他们告知应该发往哪家医院。
At present, most public interest organizations contact the local Red Cross or the General Charity Association when they find a source and ask if the material is needed and which hospital they should send to.
但是部分民间组织更希望能定点支援医院和医生，在他们看来，官方机构可能首要支持头部医院，而另一些在公众视野之外的医院面临处境更危急。
But some civil society groups prefer targeted support for hospitals and doctors, arguing that official agencies may primarily support head hospitals, while others are at greater risk outside the public eye.
上述民间组织发起人说，比如武汉某专科医院，没有设立发热门诊，也不是定点医院，但是有十几个医生被感染，不为外人知道。
Wuhan, for example, a specialized hospital, did not set up a fever clinic, is not a designated hospital, but a dozen doctors were infected, unknown to outsiders.
他们希望直接给前线医生输送物资，来补充官方组织倾斜外的一部分供给。
They want to send supplies directly to front-line doctors to supplement what the official organization is leaning out of.
他们通过自有渠道从国内、韩国、日本、印度等地收集以护目镜为主的物资，把物资信息发给医院采购部看是否需要。
They collect goggles-based materials from home, Korea, Japan and India through their own channels and send the information to the purchasing department of the hospital to see if it is needed.
对方反馈，一些物资如果医院的渠道自己采购不达标准，但现状是“有些医院什么都没有，甚至拿塑料袋当防护服”，“有一些就不错了”，所以急需捐赠。
Feedback that some supplies are badly needed if hospitals are to source their own supplies, but the current situation is "some hospitals have nothing, even plastic bags as protective clothing," "some are good," so urgently need donations.
“现在最大的问题不仅仅是缺物资，而是中间的分配和分发有问题。
"The biggest problem now is not just the shortage of supplies, but the distribution and distribution of the centre.
”上述人士担心，红十字会积压了太多物资，导致分配效率下降，而他们通过点对点支援医院和医生，能够更高效补充当前的一部分短缺。
These people worry that the Red Cross is overstocked, leading to a reduction in distribution efficiency, and that they can more efficiently fill some of the current shortages by supporting hospitals and doctors on a point-to-point basis.
所以他们的思路是，帮助急需物资的医院缓解三四天短期压力，直到官方渠道的物资输送到他们手中。
So the idea is to help desperately needed hospitals ease short-term stress for three or four days until supplies from official sources reach them.
这样中间出现了一个矛盾，武汉红十字会等官方机构需要统一协调物资，而一些民间团体希望点对点支持。
There is a contradiction between the need for official agencies, such as the Wuhan Red Cross, to coordinate supplies, and the desire of some civil society groups for peer-to-peer support.
救援思路上的差异使两者间产生分歧。
Differences in rescue thinking have divided the two.
比如，上述人士最早通过中铁快运把物资输送到武汉，然后再由武汉热心人士开车把物资送到指定医院，但后来这条线路断掉了。
For example, the above-mentioned people first transported goods to Wuhan by express rail and then drove them to designated hospitals by Wuhan enthusiasts, but then the line broke down.
德邦虽称可以免费运送公益物资，但是对重量、企业身份等的限制很多。
De Pont says it can deliver public goods for free, but there are many restrictions on weight, business identity and so on.
所以只能通过顺丰运进去。
So we can only get in through luck.
“现在这条路可能会被堵上。
"The road may be blocked now.
”他在27日接受采访时说，“我们现在也很无奈，我们千辛万苦找了很多货，但是送不过去，医院那边医生都联系好了，就是送不到。
"We are very helpless now," he said in an interview on the 27th. "We had a lot of hard work to find a lot of goods, but we couldn't deliver them.
”他听说有类似团体的物资空运到武汉，被红十字会拦截了，要统一收拢再发放。
He heard that supplies from a similar group had been airlifted to Wuhan and intercepted by the Red Cross to be collected and distributed.
而他们自己在路上的几批货，迟迟没有动静，“让医院去催顺丰，电话也打不通”。
And their own several shipments on the road, delayed movement, "let the hospital go Shunfeng, the telephone is also blocked."
他们前期筹集资金20万元，之后不断有人追着想投钱，规模达到百万。
They raised 200,000 yuan upfront, and then there was a lot of follow-up, up to a million dollars.
现在钱不是问题，采购也能尽力解决，就怕运输链路打不通，所以他们拒绝了更多善意的资本。
Now money is not the problem, and procurement can do its best, fearing that the transport link will not work, so they reject more goodwill capital.
他觉得自己“偷偷摸摸的，感觉跟做贼似的”。
He felt "furtive, like a thief."
不过，在焦急等待几天后，好消息是，他们的那批货终于到了。
But after waiting impatiently for a few days, the good news is that their shipment has finally arrived.
一位公益基金资深人士认为，目前这种情况达到最高效率一定需要国家统筹，专业的事情交给专业的人做，不然可能会造成大家一腔热情买了口罩，送到医院起不到作用。
A senior pro bono fund person believes that the current situation to achieve maximum efficiency must be a national co-ordination, professional matters to be done by professional people, or may result in a passionate purchase of masks, the hospital will have no effect.
核心医院及医护人员肯定是国家优先保障的，而基于时间一时无法顾及到的比如社区，民间力量可以补齐。
Core hospitals and health-care workers must be a national priority, and civil society forces can fill in gaps that cannot be reached in time, such as the community.
公益基金也不要单打独斗，不要在意谁买了多少N95，谁买了多少医用口罩。
Public benefit funds should not fight alone, do not care who bought how much N95, who bought how many medical masks.
关键时刻，不管是官方力量还是民间力量应当形成合力。
Critical moments, whether official or civilian forces should form a joint effort.
1月29日，湖北省省长王晓东宣布，截至当天12时，湖北全省慈善系统、红十字会系统，累计收到慈善金额42.6亿元，慈善物资529万件。
On January 29, the governor of Hubei Province, Wang Xiaodong, announced that as of 12: 00 noon on the same day, the entire Hubei province had received 4.26 billion yuan in charitable donations and 5.29 million pieces of charity materials.
灾难面前，有招摇撞骗、冒充航空公司、差点骗取几十万的人；有离谱抬价、趁机从中牟利的人；当然更多是为了紧急支援疫区的热血机构和人士，但他们面临一定的沟通阻力。
In the face of the disaster, there are swindling, pretending to be airlines, almost deceiving hundreds of thousands of people; people who are taking advantage of the opportunity to inflate their prices; and, of course, emergency support for hot-blooded organizations and people in affected areas, but they face some communication resistance.
在这里，人性的善良和阴暗一齐爆发，而在社会这个庞杂运转机体中，善与善之间也可能横梗一道无声的屏障。
Here, too, the goodness and gloom of humanity burst forth, and in this jumble of functioning societies, a silent barrier between good and good is possible.
我们不能助长了恶，同时，官方机构和民间组织也应树立更畅通的沟通机制，减少在善念间流通不必要的猜忌和摩擦。
We must not encourage evil, and official institutions and civil society organizations should establish better communication mechanisms to reduce unnecessary mistrust and friction in the flow of ideas.
