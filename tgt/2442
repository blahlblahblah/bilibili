“如果疫情长期扩散，我们的医疗体系会崩溃”  2月25日，韩国总统文在寅（前排左一）到访大邱，称力争本周内控制局势，让拐点尽快到来。
"If the epidemic continues to spread, our healthcare system will collapse," South Korean President Wen Jung-yin (first from the front row) visited Daegu on Feb. 25, saying he would try to control the situation this week and let the inflection point arrive as soon as possible.
中新社发 青瓦台供图 摄在韩国总统文在寅亲临一线考察四天后，韩国新冠疫情重灾区大邱市的确诊病例数量依然在快速增长。
The number of confirmed cases in Daegu, South Korea's worst-hit city, is still growing rapidly four days after President Wen Jung-yin's first-hand visit.
2月29日下午5时，韩国政府发布新冠疫情最新数据，全国确诊病例达3150例，其中大邱及其所属庆尚北道累计确诊2645例，占总感染人数的84%。
At 5 p.m. on February 29, the South Korean government released the latest data on the new crown epidemic, with 3,150 confirmed cases nationwide, including 2,645 confirmed cases in Daegu and Gyeongshan North Province, accounting for 84 percent of the total.
1月20日出现首个确诊病例后，韩国的新冠疫情一度较为稳定，至2月18日共31人确诊。
Following the first confirmed case on January 20, the new crown in South Korea was once stable, with 31 people diagnosed as of February 18.
但因18日开始“新天地教会”大邱教会爆发聚集性病例，韩国新冠病毒感染人数最近两周迅速上升，20日破百，26日破千。
But since the beginning of the Church of Xintiandi Daegu church cluster cases, the number of people infected with the new crown virus rose rapidly in the past two weeks, breaking 100% on the 20th, breaking 1000 on the 26th.
绝大多数病例与韩国第三大城市、拥有240万人口的大邱直接相关。
The vast majority of cases are directly related to Daegu, South Korea's third largest city, with a population of 2.4 million.
2月25日以来，韩国总理丁世均和保健福祉部长官朴淩厚一直坐镇大邱市政府，执行文在寅要求的“最大程度封锁”措施，防止疫情的社区传播。
Since February 25, South Korea's Prime Minister, Seok Ting, and Minister for Health and Welfare Park Gwok-hoe have been sitting in the town of Daegu to enforce the "maximum blockade" imposed by Wen Yin Yin to prevent the spread of the epidemic in the community.
文在寅2月25日访问大邱时要求，争取使疫情拐点“在本周之内到来”。
Wen asked during a visit to Daegu on Feb. 25 to try to make the inflection point "come within this week."
但两天后，韩国中央防疫对策本部本部长郑银敬在记者会上表示，大邱地区的确诊病例近期仍将持续增加。
But two days later, the minister of the Central Anti-epidemic Policy, Zheng Yingjing, told a press conference that confirmed cases in Daegu would continue to increase in the near future.
现阶段，韩国防疫部门的重点是对访问过大邱或与“新天地教会”接触过的人进行居家隔离和检测。
At this stage, the focus of the Korean epidemic prevention department is to isolate and test people who have visited Daegu or come into contact with Xintiandi Church.
“在此过程中若早期发现病例，将有助于防止交叉感染。
"Early detection of cases during this process will help prevent cross-infection.
”郑银敬表示。
"said Mr Cheng.
“如果疫情长期扩散，我们的医疗体系会崩溃”  “护士的防护服太厚、太重，只能穿很短时间，每隔两个小时就要换班。
"If the epidemic spreads over a long period of time, our health-care system will collapse." "Nurses wear suits that are too thick and too heavy to wear for very short periods of time and change shifts every two hours.
”2月27日，启明大学大邱东山医院人士在接受《中国新闻周刊》电话采访时，描述了当地医护救治新冠病毒肺炎患者的情况。
In a telephone interview with China News Weekly on February 27, residents of Daegu Dongshan Hospital at Qiming University described local medical treatment for patients with Newcastle virus pneumonia.
2015年5月，中东呼吸综合征（MERS）疫情在韩国爆发时，朴槿惠政府的医疗应对饱受批评。
In May 2015, when the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak erupted in South Korea, Park's government was criticized for its health-care response.
政府未公开MERS病例的收治医院名单，而“零号病人”先后四次自行转院治疗，直接、间接导致180余人感染，使韩国成为中东之外MERS疫情最严重的国家。
The government has not made public the list of hospitals in which MERS cases are admitted, and Patient Zero has been transferred to hospital for treatment four times, directly or indirectly infecting more than 180 people, making the ROK the country with the worst incidence of MERS outside the Middle East.
当年7月，韩国政府基于《公共卫生管理法》首次建立公共卫生信息公开制度。
In July of that year, the Korean government established the public health information disclosure system for the first time based on the Public Health Management Act.
2016年寨卡病毒疫情爆发后，韩国政府首次援引公共卫生信息公开制度，公布了全部收治医院的名单。
For the first time since the outbreak of the Zika virus in 2016, the Korean government has published a full list of hospitals, citing the public health information disclosure system.
据大邱市政府官网信息，在2020年2月18日“新天地教会”疫情爆发后，大邱市已指定并公布了15家医疗机构进行新冠病毒检测。
On February 18, 2020, after the outbreak of Xintiandi Church, Daegu designated and announced 15 medical institutions to test for the new crown virus, according to Daegu Municipal Government website.
市政府在官网上特别提及，疑似感染新冠肺炎的孕产妇可以到其中一家指定医院检测。
The city government said on its website that pregnant women suspected of contracting pneumonia could be tested at one of the designated hospitals.
启明大学大邱东山医院（以下简称“大邱东山医院”）人士对《中国新闻周刊》介绍，大邱市目前的收治流程是：如果有市民出现疑似症状，会先前往上述指定检测机构进行病毒检测，检测约6小时可得出结果，呈阳性即移送政府指定的收治医院治疗。
People at Daegu Dongshan Hospital of Qiming University ("Daegu Dongshan Hospital") told the China News Weekly that the current treatment process in Daegu is that if a person has suspected symptoms, he will first go to the designated testing institution for virus detection and test results for about six hours.
大邱东山医院是全封闭管理的指定收治医院，不负责检测，只负责治疗轻症确诊患者。
Taegu Tung Shan Hospital is a fully closed management designated hospital, not responsible for testing, only responsible for the treatment of patients diagnosed with mild illness.
如果患者转为重症，则再移送到该医院的上级医院——启明大学东山医院（以下简称“东山医院”）治疗。
If the patient becomes seriously ill, he will be transferred to the hospital's superior hospital, the Dongshan Hospital of Qiming University (hereinafter referred to as "Dongshan Hospital").
截至2月27日，大邱东山医院共收治了232名确诊轻症患者，东山医院则收治了10名左右的重症患者。
As at 27 February, 232 patients had been admitted to Tai Qiu Tung Shan Hospital, while around 10 patients had been admitted to Tung Shan Hospital.
此前，韩国《中央日报》等媒体曾报道大邱有上百名患者因为床位不够，无法住院治疗。
Earlier, South Korea's Central Daily newspaper and other media reported that hundreds of Daegu patients because of lack of beds, unable to hospital.
有大邱东山医院人士对《中国新闻周刊》坦言：“在有些医院，患者无法住院，目前是不可避免的。
"In some hospitals, it is inevitable that patients cannot be hospitalized," Dacu Dongshan Hospital sources told China News Weekly.
因为其他医院即使想腾出床位，也要先转移院内的非新冠肺炎患者，这需要手续和时间。
Because other hospitals want to vacate their beds, they have to transfer patients with non-Newly Coronary Pneumonia, which takes time and formality.
”在启用大邱东山医院后，床位不足的问题已解决。
With the opening of Daegu Tung Shan Hospital, the problem of insufficient beds has been resolved.
启明大学东山医院是大邱规模最大的大学医院，拥有120年的历史。
Dongshan Hospital of Qiming University is the largest university hospital in Daegu with a history of 120 years.
2019年4月，东山医院搬迁到现址，原址则改为大邱东山医院。
In April 2019, Dongshan Hospital was relocated to its present location, which was changed to Daegu Tung Shan Hospital.
大邱东山医院人士介绍，因为该院原址规模很大，所以虽然医院现在只有200多个床位，却保留有大约1000个床位的空间和设施，如果物资和人员到位，随时可以恢复到收治上千名患者的状态。
Due to the size of the hospital, the hospital now has only over 200 beds, but it retains space and facilities of about 1,000 beds, which can be restored to the capacity of thousands of patients when supplies and personnel are in place.
“就算患者数量继续增加，从医院的病床数量、现有设施和空间大小来看，还是完全能容纳的。
"Even if the number of patients continues to increase, the number of hospital beds, the facilities available and the size of the space are sufficient.
”该人士指出。
"said the man.
该人士同时指出，虽然不缺床位，但医院的医用口罩、手套和防护服一直处于紧缺状态。
The source also noted that although there was no shortage of beds, the hospital's medical masks, gloves and protective clothing remained in short supply.
“从长期来看，由于患者数量一直在增长，再加上这些（口罩、手套、防护服）都是一次性消耗品，肯定还需要更多的上述医用物资。
"In the long run, because the number of patients has been increasing, and because these [masks, gloves, protective clothing] are disposable consumables, there will certainly be a need for more of these medical supplies."
”他说。
'he said.
据韩国媒体报道，在韩国另一处疫情比较严重的庆尚北道的清道大南医院，部分医护人员连防护服都没有，仅仅戴着口罩。
South Korean media reported that in another South Korean hospital, Ching Nam Road in the northeastern province of Gyeongshan, some medical staff did not even have protective clothing, only wearing masks.
此后，该医院出现聚集性疫情。
Since then, the hospital has experienced a concentrated epidemic.
大邱出现聚集性疫情后，当地市民金基焕（音）经常收到当地政府发来的提醒短信，大致内容是：为防止感染新冠病毒，请市民注意个人卫生，勤洗手、戴口罩、少出门。
Local residents Kim Kyung-hwan often receive reminders from local authorities about personal hygiene, frequent hand-washing, wearing masks and less going out to prevent new infections of the virus.
“可是，现在去药店、超市都买不到口罩了。
"But now I can't get a mask at the drugstore or the supermarket.
”2月27日，金基焕对《中国新闻周刊》表示，“我家里只有4只口罩，但是每天还要上班，每天都用掉一个。
"I only have four masks at home, but I have to work every day and use one every day," Kim told China News Weekly on Feb. 27.
我愁着去哪里买点口罩，政府说会再给我们提供一批口罩，现在我还在等。
I'm worried about where to buy some masks. The government says it will supply us with more masks, and I'm still waiting.
”据韩国《中央日报》报道，韩国国内的防护口罩生产厂家有113家，每天最大产量是1300万个，但是此前大量口罩被运往了中国。
South Korea has 113 manufacturers of face masks and a maximum of 13 million a day, but a large number of them have been shipped to China, the country's Central Daily reported.
金基焕发现，之前“几百韩元到一千韩元”的普通口罩涨到了4000到5000韩元（约23到28元人民币），“但是也买不到”。
Kim Kyung-hwan found that the average mask, which had previously cost "hundreds of won to a thousand won," rose to 4,000 to 5,000 won (about Rmb23- Rmb28), "but not yet available."
在大邱的中国留学生阿白则观察到，她之前购买的防疫口罩在有些药店里已经从平常的2500韩元（约15元人民币）左右涨价到了6000韩元（约34元人民币）。
Abbey, a Chinese student in Daegu, observed that her previously purchased face masks had risen from about 2,500 won (about Rmb15) in some pharmacies to 6,000 won (about Rmb34).
据韩联社报道，截至2月27日，大邱市有20余名医护人员感染新冠病毒，260余名医护人员被隔离。
As of February 27, more than 20 medical workers in Daegu had been infected with the new crown virus and more than 260 medical workers had been quarantined, according to KFW.
大邱东山医院对《中国新闻周刊》介绍，目前该院医护尚无被感染者，但其上级医院东山医院2月24日已有一名护士确诊。
Taegu Dongshan Hospital told China News Weekly that the hospital had not been infected, but its superior hospital Dongshan Hospital on February 24, a nurse confirmed.
更大的问题是医护人员数量不足。
A bigger problem is the shortage of health-care workers.
截至2月27日，大邱东山医院参与救治新冠肺炎患者的医护人员及其他员工共有246人，从韩国其他地区前来援助的医护人员有97人。
As of February 27, 246 medical staff and other staff of Taegu Tung Shan Hospital were involved in treating patients with Newcomost Pneumonia, and 97 medical staff from other parts of the country had come to help.
该院人士对《中国新闻周刊》介绍，现在医院的护士们按工作两小时、休息两小时、再工作两小时的模式不断工作，“只有人员数量上去了，才有可能实现（换班）。
The hospital's nurses are now working two hours a day, two hours off and two more hours on the job. "It's only possible if the number of people goes up," the hospital told China News Weekly.
”此外，处理医疗废弃物、打扫卫生的清洁人员也很急需。
There is also an urgent need for cleaners to deal with medical waste and clean-up.
此前，有参与救治工作的医生对韩国媒体透露，人手缺乏导致一线医护“很多人每天只能睡3个小时”。
Earlier, doctors involved in the treatment told South Korean media that the shortage of staff had led to "many people sleeping only three hours a day."
该医生说：“大家已经非常疲劳，再这样下去，不是因为感染上病毒，而是会因为体力不支倒下。
"People are very tired," the doctor said. "If it goes on like this, it's not because of the virus, but because the body is unable to support itself.
”2月27日，韩国医院协会发出警告，称大邱地区各医院防护物资不够、医护人员缺乏的问题严峻，甚至出现“普通患者因为当地无法救治而涌入首尔”的情况。
On February 27, the Korean Hospital Association (KHA) warned that hospitals in Daegu were short of protective materials, that there was a shortage of medical staff and that there was even an "influx of ordinary patients into Seoul due to the unavailability of local medical care."
“假如疫情长期扩散，各医院将难以承担这一压力，我们国家的医疗体系会崩溃。
"If the epidemic spreads over the long term, hospitals will find it difficult to cope and our national health system will collapse.
”首尔大学医院院长金研修（音）建议，政府可以考虑仅安排指定医院收治20%的重症患者，而让80%左右的轻症的无症状感染者在医院之外的地方隔离治疗。
Kim Seok-soo, dean of Seoul University's medical institute, suggested that the government could consider treating only 20 per cent of critically ill patients in designated hospitals, leaving about 80 per cent of asymptomatic patients isolated outside hospitals.
对此，文在寅于早前在工作会议中指出，将争取民间医疗机构和医务人员的合作参与抗疫。
In response, Wen said earlier in the working session that the cooperation of civil medical institutions and medical personnel will be sought to fight the epidemic.
目前，已有200余名民间医生自发前往大邱等地支援抗疫。
At present, more than 200 folk doctors have spontaneously gone to Daegu and other places to support the fight against the epidemic.
大邱市市长权泳臻甚至呼吁中央政府“调派军医等前来协助”，韩国国防部长官郑景斗在2月28日回应，韩国军方的大邱医院正在建设转变为治疗新冠病毒患者的指定医院，目前韩国空军正投入兵力开展扩建工程。
Kwon Young-jin, mayor of Daegu, even called on the central government to "send medical staff and other personnel to assist." Defense Minister Kim Jong-joo responded on February 28 that the Taegu Hospital of the South Korean military is being built into a designated hospital for treating patients with the new crown virus.
现有的疫情防控体系已经被攻破“若不能有效阻断社区传播，大邱疫情很可能扩散至全国。
The existing epidemic prevention and control system has been broken "If we can not effectively block community transmission, Daegu epidemic is likely to spread throughout the country.
”韩国中央应急处置本部副本部长金刚立2月24日指出。
Kim Gang-li, deputy minister of the Central Emergency Management Department, said on February 24.
次日，文在寅指示，要尽一切手段阻止病毒在这座韩国第三大城市传播。
The next day, Wen directed that every effort be made to stop the virus from spreading in South Korea's third-largest city.
当天，韩国政府决定对大邱市和庆尚北道采取“最大程度封锁”。
The South Korean government decided to impose a "maximum blockade" on Daegu and Gyeongshan North Province.
青瓦台发言人康珉硕随后对媒体表示，该“封锁措施”是指尽快寻找并隔离接触病例的人员，阻断疫情扩散及社区传播，但并不禁止交通出入，所以并非所谓“封城”。
Qingwatai spokesman Kang min-suo later told the media that the "blockade" refers to the search for and isolation of contact as soon as possible, blocking the spread of the epidemic and community transmission, but not banned traffic, so is not the so-called "closed city.
韩国共同民主党首席发言人洪翼杓表示，关于“最大程度的封锁政策”，政府还在商讨具体措施，可能会通过行政命令的方式尽可能减少人们的活动。
Hong Wing-pyo, chief spokesman for the common Democratic Party of Korea, said the government was still discussing concrete measures to minimize the movement of people through an executive order.
接受《中国新闻周刊》采访时，多位大邱市居民表示，截至2月28日，他们尚未收到相关行政命令，每日仍需照常上班。
In an interview with China News Weekly, residents of Daegu said they had not received an executive order as of February 28 and were still required to report to work on a daily basis.
大邱市政府网站仅提示市民“自我克制减少出门”。
The Daegu City government website only suggests that citizens "refrain from going out."
“封锁措施”实施后，大邱市关闭了部分公营机构，加强了街道消毒作业。
After the implementation of the "blockade measures," the city of Daegu closed some public institutions and stepped up street disinfection operations.
据《纽约时报》报道，大邱市最大的市场西门市场经过一天的消毒后曾于2月24日重新开放。
Siemens, the city's largest market, reopened on February 24 after a day of disinfection, The New York Times reported.
但三天后，西门市场再次关闭进行全面消毒，重新开放时间暂定为3月1日。
But three days later, Siemens closed again for full disinfection, tentatively scheduled to reopen on March 1.
在大邱工作的中国人韩城告诉《中国新闻周刊》，他所在的公司也已经开始全面消毒，每天量体温，公司里摆放了很多消毒液。
Han Cheng, a Chinese working in Taegu, told China News Weekly that his company had also started to disinfect thoroughly, taking daily temperature measurements and putting lots of disinfectant in the company.
但市民金基焕说，他的居住地和单位都没有采取特别的防疫措施，小区和单位也还没有进行过消毒。
But citizen Kim Kyung-hwan said no special epidemic prevention measures have been taken in his place of residence or work unit, and that the area and unit have not been disinfected.
据韩国媒体报道，早在2月22日政府和学界共同探讨文在寅政府的“最大程度封锁”措施时，韩国流行病学学会人士就指出，考虑到防疫范围之外的患者人数骤增，仅通过追踪确诊患者来隔离接触者的防疫战略是不可行的。
As early as February 22, when the government and academia jointly discussed the "maximum containment" measures of the government, Korean Epidemiology Society personnel pointed out that, given the sharp increase in the number of patients outside the scope of epidemic prevention, it is not feasible to isolate contacts only by tracking confirmed patients.
“现在已经证实无症状患者也具有传染性，所以不能只对有症状的人进行隔离，这种做法是不可能防止进一步传染的。
"It has now been established that asymptomatic patients are also infectious, so it is not possible to isolate people who have symptoms, which is unlikely to prevent further transmission.
”2月28日，韩国首尔大学感染内科主任崔平俊（音）公开表示。
On February 28, Choi Pingjun, director of infectious medicine at Seoul University, said publicly.
同日，首尔市立西北医院院长朴灿炳（音）也向媒体表达对当前措施的质疑，认为现在大邱市很难做到追踪和封锁式防疫，可以说现有的疫情防控体系已经被攻破。
On the same day, President Park Chan-ping of Seoul's Northwest Hospital also expressed doubts to the media about the current measures, arguing that Daegu is now very difficult to track and block epidemic prevention, can be said that the existing epidemic prevention and control system has been broken.
崔平俊还表示，如果文在寅政府现在开始全力采取“减少人与人之间的接触和人群聚集”等措施，疫情可以在两周内得到缓解，但是假如其他地区也出现大规模扩散，疫情还会持续更久。
Cui said the outbreak could be alleviated in two weeks if the government of Wen is now fully committed to measures such as "reducing people-to-people contact and crowd gathering," but if there is a large-scale spread elsewhere, the epidemic will continue for a long time to come.
最糟糕的一种情况是疫情持续到今年年底，而韩国40%的人都会感染新冠肺炎。
In the worst case scenario, the outbreak continues until the end of the year, with 40% of South Koreans infected with pneumonia.
采访中，阿白和韩城都提到，他们最近几天依然看到有人不戴口罩。
In the interview, both Mr. Abe and Mr. Han said they have seen people wearing masks in recent days.
“路人基本上90%都会戴口罩，但是偶尔还会看见那么几个不戴的。
"passersby basically wear masks for 90% of the time, but occasionally they see a few that don't.
”阿白表示，“有的人在咖啡店里坐在一起距离很近，也不戴口罩。
"Some people sit close to each other in a coffee shop and don't wear masks," she said.
”“他们就像不知道有新冠病毒一样。
"" It's like they didn't know there was a new crown jewel.
”韩城说。
"said Han.
