文/王钟的一场突如其来的新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情，延缓了各地大中小学开学的时间表。
Wen / Wang Zhong's outbreak of pneumonia, a new coronavirus infection, has delayed the start of school and university classes everywhere.
目前，由于疫情仍然持续，开学时间并不明朗。
The timing of the start of the school year is unclear, as the epidemic continues.
面对意外延长的假期，如何让学生在家继续学习，避免荒废功课，成了教育者必须思考和回答的问题。
Facing the unexpected extension of vacation, how to let the students continue their studies at home and avoid neglecting their lessons has become a question that educators must ponder and answer.
对此，教育部印发《关于在疫情防控期间做好普通高等学校在线教学组织与管理工作的指导意见》，要求各高校实现“停课不停教、停课不停学”。
In this regard, the Ministry of Education issued the "Guidelines on the Organization and Management of Online Teaching in Universities during the Prevention and Control of Epidemics," which requires universities to "stop teaching and learning without interruption."
多家在线教育头部企业响应教育部门的号召，为在家学习的学生提供免费课程。
A number of online head-line education companies responded to a call from the education sector to offer free courses for home-based students.
疫情让在线教育意外地走上“C位”，甚至带动节后A股开盘首日相关概念股逆市上扬。
The epidemic unexpectedly put online education on "C" spot, even driving the post-holiday A-share opening day-related conceptual shares rose against the market.
人们依稀记得，正是17年前的“非典”疫情，让当下人们熟悉的电商平台崭露头角。
It is vaguely remembered that it was the SARS epidemic 17 years ago that gave rise to today's familiar electric business platforms.
评价一类新产业具有多大的发展潜力，首先观察其日常基本面。
To evaluate the development potential of a new type of industry, first look at its daily fundamentals.
在看到“非典”疫情孕育一批电商企业的同时，也要看到电商行业在十多年间经历的坎坷。
While seeing that the SARS epidemic breeds a batch of enterprises, we should also see the difficulties experienced by the electrical and commercial industry in more than a decade.
从打击假冒伪劣产品，到提高物流配送水平，电商行业为了克服其先天的弊端和不足，经历了无数的探索和试验。
From cracking down on fake and inferior products to improving logistics and distribution level, the electronic commerce industry has experienced numerous explorations and experiments in order to overcome its innate defects and deficiencies.
疫情终将会结束，社会也会回到常态，延迟开学对在线教育是一次展示的良机，但如果要把它当成发展的“拐点”，还有很多具体工作要做。
The epidemic will eventually end, and society will return to normal. Delaying the start of school is an opportunity to showcase online education, but much more needs to be done if it is to be seen as an "inflection point" for development.
现代教育不仅是知识传授的过程，也充分参与一个人社会化的过程。
Modern education is not only a process of knowledge transfer, but also a full participation in a person's socialization process.
在绝大多数购物场景中，面对面交易并不是刚需，很多年轻人甚至厌烦面对面磨人的杀价过程，这也是网络购物最终为大众所接受的重要因素。
In most shopping situations, face-to-face trading is not a must, and many young people are even tired of the face-to-face grind-to-kill process, an important factor in the eventual acceptance of online shopping.
然而，教育恰恰存在很多面对面的刚需，学生和教师需要课堂互动，学生与学生之间需要培养友谊，教师与教师之间也有业务交流的需要。
However, there are many face-to-face needs in education, students and teachers need classroom interaction, students and students need to cultivate friendship, and teachers and teachers need business communication.
因此，“在家学习”并不是在线教育的优势，在线教育也不宜把它的弱互动性当成卖点。
Therefore, "learning at home" is not the advantage of online education, online education should not take its weak interaction as a selling point.
就常态层面而言，在线教育的真正价值在于其推动教育平权的功能。
On a normal level, the real value of online education lies in its function of promoting equal rights in education.
由于国内地区发展差异大，教育资源分布不平衡，优质教育资源更是集中在大城市。
Due to the large regional development differences, the distribution of educational resources is not balanced, quality educational resources are concentrated in large cities.
而且，即便在城市地区，教育资源也分布不均，“择校”始终是困扰家长的难题，高等教育资源更是集中在部分知名高校。
Moreover, even in urban areas, educational resources are unevenly distributed, "school selection" is always a difficult problem for parents, and higher education resources are concentrated in some well-known universities.
但是，在线教育可以弥补教育资源地区间、学校间的鸿沟，只要有一块屏幕、一根网线，学生就可以聆听名师的在线授课。
Online education, however, can bridge the gap between regions and schools in terms of educational resources, with students being able to listen to online lectures by well-known teachers as long as there is a screen and a wire.
实际上，在线教育在教育平权方面已有良好实践。
Indeed, online education already has good practices in the area of educational equity.
例如，中国青年报题为《这块屏幕可能改变命运》的报道，记录了248所西部贫困地区的中学通过直播与名校成都七中同步上课，有的学校终结了“零一本”的历史，有的学生考上了北大、清华。
For example, the China Youth Daily report, entitled "The Screen Can Change Destiny," recorded 248 middle schools in poor western areas running simultaneously with the prestigious Chengdu VII Middle School. Some schools closed the "zero one" history and some students were admitted to Peking University and Tsinghua University.
通过在线教育，贫困地区学校在一定程度上弥补了师资、教学管理等方面的欠缺，体现了现代教育机会平等的理念。
Through online education, schools in poor areas to some extent make up for the lack of teachers, teaching management and other aspects of the concept of equal opportunities in modern education.
因为授课形式不同，在线教育也体现出传统课堂教育所不具备的一些优势。
Online education also shows some advantages that traditional classroom education does not have because of the different forms of teaching.
比如，课堂教育具有即时性，而且是一对多教学，学生必须紧跟教师授课的节奏，那些一时难以消化的知识点，就可能成为教学的盲区；相比之下，在线教育因为是人机互动的一对一操作，教学视频可回放，学生可以及时巩固理解薄弱的教学内容。
Classroom education, for example, is instantaneous and one-to-many, and students must keep up with the pace of the teacher's lessons. Those that are difficult to digest can become a blind spot for teaching; in contrast, online education, because it is a one-on-one human-computer interaction, allows students to consolidate weak teaching content in a timely manner.
不管采取怎么样的教学形式，教师始终是教学的组织者和实施者。
No matter what form of teaching is adopted, the teacher is always the organizer and executor of the teaching.
疫情之下，教师应当积极尝试在线教育平台，把以往线下教育的内容搬到线上。
Under the epidemic situation, teachers should actively try to online education platform, the content of the previous offline education to move online.
目前，由于开学时间还不确定，北京等地已考虑将高考模拟考放到网上的方案，学生在家答题，将答卷传给教师阅卷。
At present, due to uncertainty about the start of the school year, Beijing and other places have considered putting the college entrance examination simulation test online, students answer the questions at home and pass the answers to teachers for examination.
针对这类特殊需求，在线教育行业应积极提供技术支持，为学生提供真实的考试感受，方便他们从容应对未来的高考。
For such special needs, online education industry should actively provide technical support to provide students with real-life examination experience, so as to facilitate them to cope with the future college entrance examination.
尽管当前一些城市职场人士也习惯于使用在线教育平台，热衷于所谓“知识付费”的概念，但教育的主体终究还是学生，公共性依然是教育的本质。
Although some urban workers are now used to using online educational platforms and are keen on the concept of "pay-for-knowledge," the main body of education is still students, and publicity remains the essence of education.
目前，在线教育领域也发展成了两种不同模式：一种由教育部门和相关学校牵头组织，向社会提供廉价或免费的在线课程；另一种则由在线教育企业提供，企业天然地具有营利性，相关课程的收费较高。
Currently, online education has developed into two different models: one led by the education sector and the relevant school, offering low-cost or free online courses to society; the other offered by online educational enterprises, which are naturally for profit and charge higher fees for related courses.
在线教育要进一步发展，必须要明确其属性，究竟是立足于公益，还是走完全市场化的路子。
In order to further develop online education, it is necessary to determine whether it is based on the public interest or whether to take a completely market-oriented approach.
在当前学校教育组织形式、学生考查方式不发生大的变化的前提下，在线教育更应当利用其技术特点，为教学提供更便利化的渠道。
On the premise of not changing the way of organizing school education and examining students, online education should make use of its technical characteristics and provide a more convenient channel for teaching.
比如，让更多学生感受到名师的魅力，也让一些课程内容实现线上讨论，教师实时答疑解惑。
For example, let more students feel the glamour of famous teachers, also let some curriculum content achieve online discussion, teachers answer questions in real time.
也许在线教育全面取代传统学校教育尚需时日，但人们期待它能够搅动当下教育格局中某些一成不变的部分，让教育资源分配更加公平，让教育焕发出新生。
While it may take time for online education to replace traditional schooling altogether, it is expected to disrupt some of the unchanging parts of the current educational landscape, make the distribution of education resources more equitable, and revitalize education.
