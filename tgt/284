”国家卫健委副主任李斌在2020年1月22日公开强调，督促湖北省和武汉市采取最严格的防控措施。
On January 22, 2020, Li Bin, deputy director of the National Fitness and Wellness Commission, publicly stressed that the city of Hubei and Wuhan should adopt the strictest prevention and control measures.
22日凌晨，湖北省已启动突发公共卫生事件Ⅱ级（重大级别）应急响应。
In the early morning hours of May 22, the province of Hubei Province launched a public health emergency level II (major level) emergency response.
这距离官方首次发布“武汉肺炎”信息已过去24天。
It is 24 days since the official first announcement of Wuhan Pneumonia.
截至1月22日24点，全国确诊新型冠状病毒感染肺炎549例，疑似137例，死亡17例。
As of 24: 00 on January 22, 549 cases of new coronavirus infection pneumonia, 137 suspected cases and 17 deaths were diagnosed nationwide.
尽管市政府要求在全市公共场所都要戴口罩，包括宾馆、理发店、候诊室等人群聚集的公共场所。
Although the city government requires masks to be worn in public places throughout the city, including hotels, barber shops, waiting rooms and other public places where people congregate.
然而，武汉似乎尚未完全跟上疫情扩散的节奏。
Wuhan, however, does not seem to have fully kept pace with the spread of the epidemic.
1月22日，一位从北京回到武汉过节的人告诉《财经》记者，武汉的高铁、地铁、机场是1月20号病例数快速增长后，才开始做体温测试的，目测戴口罩的人与不戴的人各占一半。
A man returning to Wuhan on January 22 told Caijing that Wuhan's high-speed rail, subway and airport systems had been tested for body temperature only after a rapid increase in the number of cases on January 20.
“没北京非典那么吓人，这边人没那么紧张，至少我前天去医院，有一半看病的病人没戴口罩”。
"It's not as scary as SARS in Beijing. People here are not so nervous. At least I went to the hospital the day before yesterday.
1月19日，在川流不息的武汉火车站，负责旅客安全的安检工作人员还没有全部戴口罩。
Security officials in charge of passenger safety at the busy Wuhan railway station did not all wear masks on January 19.
“武汉航班的空姐还没有戴口罩。
"Wuhan flight attendants are still not wearing masks.
”一位近日乘坐飞机从武汉出发的传染病专家对《财经》记者说，她们需要提供微笑服务，但也是在密闭空间中接触复杂人群，应该保护。
An infectious-diseases expert who flew out of Wuhan recently told Caijing that they needed to offer a smile, but that they should also be protected by being exposed to complex people in confined spaces.
与此同时，武汉的医院一片紧张。
Meanwhile, hospitals in Wuhan are tense.
武汉一家三甲医院有医生，自1月15日官方公布“有限人传人”起就主动与家人隔离，也有医生每天乘坐地铁都忧虑的记录戴口罩人群情况。
Wuhan Sanjia Hospital has a doctor, since January 15 officially announced that "limited person to person" from the initiative to separate from their families, but also doctors every day on the subway worried about the record wearing masks.
医用口罩在很多地方已经脱销。
Medical masks are out of stock in many places.
武汉一位定点收治医院的医生告诉《财经》记者，“只有面对感染患者的患者的一线医生，能用有效防护的外科口罩和N95口罩，其他科室就用普通口罩将就。
"Only front-line doctors who deal with infected patients can use effective surgical masks and N95 face masks, while other departments will simply use ordinary masks," a doctor at a designated hospital in Wuhan told Caijing
”武汉一家三甲医院开会传达，其他科室要尽量把医用口罩和防护服，留给隔离病房的医护人员使用。
Wuhan Sanjia Hospital held a meeting to convey that other departments should try to leave medical masks and protective clothing for medical staff in the isolation ward.
医护人员缺装备2020年1月21日，武汉华中科技大学附属同济医院已启动三级预检分诊机制，专门划出5层专区作为发热门诊就诊区，并进一步加强医务人员的个人防护，以应对当前新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情。
On January 21, 2020, Wuhan Tongji Hospital, affiliated with the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, launched a three-tier pre-screening mechanism, setting aside five separate areas as hot outpatient consultation areas and further strengthening the personal protection of medical personnel in response to the current outbreak of coronavirus infection.

”武汉一位肺炎定点收治医院的医生告诉《财经》记者。
A doctor at Wuhan's designated hospital for pneumonia told Caijing.
医院短缺物资不仅缺口罩。
The shortage of hospital supplies is more than a gap.
据人民日报信息，湖北多地发现新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疑似和确诊病例，拟向国家请求紧急支援，调拨医用口罩4000万个、防护服500万套、红外测温仪5000套。
According to the People's Daily, suspected and confirmed cases of pneumonia due to a new coronavirus infection have been found in Hubei Province.
刚回武汉探亲的魏舒，感觉喉咙痛，沙哑讲不出话，发烧38度多，于是1月19日—22日，辗转去了3家医院——军工医院、同济医院和普爱医院，检查是否感染了新型冠状病毒肺炎。
Wei Shu, who had just returned to Wuhan to visit her husband, felt a sore throat, lost his voice and had a fever of 38 degrees. So on January 19-22, three hospitals - the Military Industrial Hospital, Tongji Hospital, and Pu Ai Hospital - were run over to check if they had contracted the new coronavirus pneumonia.
魏舒告诉《财经》记者，“只有同济医院发热门诊的医护人员有全套防护用品，其他全无。
Wei told Caijing, "Only the medical staff at the Tongji Hospital fever clinic have a complete set of protective equipment, nothing else.
”没有一家医院在发热门诊处提供口罩，医院里对就医人者的防护松弛，恐有交叉感染之虞。
None of the hospitals offer masks at the fever clinic, and there is a risk of cross-infection due to laxity in the hospital for patients.
魏舒认为，“在这种疫情中，医院本该给就诊病人提供口罩，非但没有提供，在物流这么发达的时代，所有药房都买不到医用口罩。
"In a situation like this, hospitals are supposed to supply surgical masks to patients," Weissu said. "Far from being provided, all pharmacies cannot buy medical masks in an age of logistics."
”可是，给魏舒打针的护士称，不能给病人提供口罩，医护人员自己都不够用，只能省着点用。
However, the nurse who gave Wei Shu an injection said the patient could not be provided with a mask and that the paramedics themselves were not enough.
“严格来讲，口罩4个小时要更换一次。
"Strictly speaking, the mask should be replaced every four hours.
而且由于疫情，普通科室的患者大量减少，尽量安排医生在家待命，这个时间就可以不用口罩。
And because of the epidemic, the number of patients in general departments has been greatly reduced, try to arrange doctors at home on standby, this time can be used without masks.
”上述武汉肺炎定点收治医院医生说。
Wuhan Pneumonia designated hospital doctors said.
1月20日，一位医疗器械经销商告诉《财经》记者，由于目前临近春节，生产端会受些影响，口罩生产厂不大愿意继续生产。
On January 20, a medical device dealer told Caijing that factories were reluctant to continue producing masks because of the impact on production terminals in the run-up to the Spring Festival.
不过，就在这两日内，一些大型口罩生产、经销商已经宣布紧急加产，保障口罩的供应。
However, within two days, some large mask production, dealers have announced an emergency increase in production to protect the supply of masks.
配送企业也在加班。
Distribution enterprises are also working overtime.
根据医药供应商九州通工作人员向《财经》记者介绍，22日通知从集团总经理到业务三级公司总经理，全部回到岗位，已经放假的叫回来，春节安排值班人员，为保障疫情相关产品的供应、安全和质量。
The general manager of the group to the general manager of the third-tier company, all of them returned to their posts and were called back for the holidays. The staff on duty for the Spring Festival were arranged to ensure the supply, safety and quality of the products related to the epidemic.
1月22日，武汉某三甲医院一名隔离病区护士告诉《财经》记者，科内开会时会反复强调，尽量省着点用，“负责人每天都在发愁从哪里弄到更多的防护服”。
On January 22, a nurse in a secluded area of a three-A hospital in Wuhan told Caijing that he would repeat during the meeting that he would try to save as much as possible.
用于确诊是否为新型冠状病毒感染检测试剂盒，也供应紧张。
Used to determine whether the new coronavirus infection detection kit is also tight supply.
上述隔离区护士所在的医院，正在进行病房改造，增加相应的隔离设施。
The hospital housing the nurses in the above-mentioned area of separation is undergoing a renovation of the wards and increasing the corresponding isolation facilities.
她告诉《财经》记者，之前，临床症状与新型冠状病毒肺炎相似患者只能住在普通的病房里，由于没有试剂盒，也没法确诊。
Previously, she told Caijing, patients with clinical symptoms similar to the new coronavirus pneumonia were confined to a common ward and could not be diagnosed without a kit.
直到1月22日，才有工作人员来医院取标本准备测试。
It was not until 22 January that staff came to the hospital to collect samples for testing.
据她所知道，最长的病人已住了10多天。
As far as she knew, the longest patient had lived for more than 10 days.
已有第三方机构参与协助病毒检测工作。
A third party agency has been involved in virus detection.
据《每日经济新闻》消息，国家卫健委发布的确诊程序中，要求确认程序在中国疾控中心或第三方检测机构接到检测标本后24小时内完成。
According to the Daily Economic News, the confirmation process is required within 24 hours of the receipt of a specimen by the China CDC or a third-party testing organization in the course of a diagnostic procedure issued by the National Fitness and Health Commission.
资源短缺不仅仅出现在湖北省。
Resource shortages are not limited to Hubei province.
山东已出现疑似病例，截止1月22日18时，青岛有1例确诊病例。
Suspected cases have emerged in Shandong. As of 18: 00 on January 22, there was one confirmed case in Qingdao.
山东某市一位医务人员对《财经》记者透露，要求医护人员都穿戴，该市疾控中心正在集中采购防护服和医用外科口罩，但都处于缺货状。
A medical worker in Shandong told Caijing that medical staff were required to wear them and that the city's CDC was concentrating on the procurement of protective clothing and medical surgical masks, but were in short supply.
所有医护人员、患者和居民都在等待之中。
All medical staff, patients and residents are waiting.
对不起，口罩没到货武汉市出现了居民在家门口买不到口罩的情况。
Sorry, the mask did not arrive in Wuhan city residents can not buy a mask in front of their homes.
在疫情最初集中的武汉市华南海鲜批发市场所在的江汉区，1月20日《财经》记者询问了几家药店的医用外科口罩或N95口罩购买情况。
In the Jianghan region, where Wuhan South China Seafood Wholesale Market was located, Caijing asked several pharmacies about the purchase of medical surgical masks or N95 masks on January 20.
一些药店的口罩已经出现短期断货。
Some drugstore masks have been out of stock for a short time.
有的药店工作人员匆匆说，“没有没有，下午到货，下午再问吧。
Some drugstore staff said hurriedly, "No, no, the afternoon arrival, ask again in the afternoon.
”也有药店人员说，今天店里的口罩已经卖完了，比以前的销量多；明天下午新一批口罩才能到货，因为店里进货也需要时间，不可能一下子就到货。
Some drugstore staff said they had sold out of masks today, more than they had sold before, and that a new batch would arrive tomorrow afternoon because it would take time to get in and it would not be possible to get them all at once.
医用口罩，指的是医用外科口罩，以及N95口罩。
Medical mask, refers to the medical surgical mask, as well as N95 mask.
以往，居民们更熟悉防霾口罩，很多带有呼吸阀；现在再去药店买口罩已经知道，“最起码得是医用的”。
Residents used to be more familiar with haze masks, many of them with respirators; now they're going to the drugstore to buy one, "at least medically."
从美国回武汉探亲的魏舒吃惊于偌大一个城市买不到口罩，还是朋友送了一个平日攒下的口罩。
Wei Shu, who returned to Wuhan from the United States to visit her relatives, was surprised that a large city could not buy a mask, or a friend gave a usually saved-up mask.
其他有感染病例传出地方，情况类似。
Other cases of infection have been reported, and the situation is similar.
“对不起，没到货”，是药店店员的常用语。
Sorry, we didn't get them. It's a common expression among drugstore clerks.
北京1月20日首度发布本市出现新型冠状病毒的确诊病例，当日上午，北京市大兴区天宫院一家药店的工作人员告诉《财经》记者，“今天明显口罩卖的特别快。
"Obviously masks are being sold very quickly today," Tian Gong Yuan, a pharmacist at the Tiangong Hospital in Daxing District, Beijing, told Caijing on January 20, the first confirmed case of a new coronavirus in the city.
”平常来她这里买口罩的人不算多，销量也不大。
Not many people usually come to her to buy masks, and sales are small.
不过今天，来问的人变多了，“大家进来就问医用的口罩。
Today, however, the number of people who came to ask became larger, "everyone came in and asked for medical masks.
”当日下午，店里的口罩就迅速销售一空。
The store quickly sold out of masks that afternoon.
一天后，北京市卫健委再度更新消息，截至1月21日18时，北京市共确诊10例新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎病例。
A day later, the Beijing Fitness and Health Commission again updated the news that as of 18: 00 on January 21, Beijing has confirmed a total of 10 new cases of coronavirus infection pneumonia.
北京市最早确诊的两例新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎病例，皆有武汉旅行史。
The first two cases of pneumonia diagnosed as coronavirus infection in Beijing have a history of travel to Wuhan.
口罩也随着这一信息断货。
Masks are also out of stock with this information.
至1月22日上午10点左右，上述北京天宫院药店的店员告诉《财经》记者，这家药店的医用外科口罩、N95口罩都已经断货了。
By 10 a.m. on January 22, shop assistants at the Beijing Tiangong Hospital pharmacy told Caijing that the pharmacy's medical surgical masks and N95 masks had been out of stock.
不仅如此，连平常的普通口罩也卖完了。
Not only that, but ordinary masks are sold out.
“下一批口罩可能是明天上午到货，货我们已经订了。
"The next batch of masks may arrive tomorrow morning. We have ordered them.
”这位店员告诉记者，21日到了一批口罩，当天就售罄，“我们现在是能进多少就要多少，但是有上限，因为各家店都得保证供应。
The clerk told reporters that 21 days after arriving at a batch of masks and selling them out the same day, "we can get as much as we can, but only up to a certain limit because stores have to ensure supplies.
”尽管鲜有儿童感染新型冠状病毒的案例，但是上述店员说，为提早预防，儿童口罩也卖得更多了。
Although there have been few cases of children contracting the new coronavirus, the salespeople said they were selling more child masks for early prevention.
1月22日，店里连儿童的口罩也断货了。
On 22 January, the store also ran out of children's masks.
不过，也有没意识到这一防护重要性的居民。
However, there are residents who are not aware of the importance of this protection.
上述武汉人士1月22日去当地一家菜市场买菜时，看到少部分人戴口罩，大部分仍是没戴。
The Wuhan people went to a local vegetable market on January 22 to buy vegetables, saw a small number of people wearing masks, most of them still do not wear.
菜市场里早已没有活禽，如果叫生鲜外卖，早上叫得排到下午6点才能送，其它超市加收14元送货费，来了让放门口，等快递员走了，家人再开门取货。
There are no live poultry in the Halles market, if called fresh take-out, the morning call can not be delivered until 6 p.m., other supermarkets add 14 yuan delivery fees, to let the door, such as express delivery left, the family then open to pick up the goods.

Wuhan city has ordered people to wear face masks in public places, including hotels, barbers' shops and waiting rooms, the Hubei Daily said Tuesday night.
