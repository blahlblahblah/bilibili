她们是大学同学，毕业后分别去了武汉华润武钢总医院和武汉市第一医院。
They are university students, after graduation to Wuhan China Resources Wugang General Hospital and Wuhan City First Hospital.
大年初一这天，她们各自从黄冈和天门出发，返回武汉待命。
On the first day of New Year, they left Huanggang and Tianmen, and returned to Wuhan for standby.
即便动身前就已得知有同事疑似感染，但她们并未犹豫。
Even though they had been informed of the suspected infection among their colleagues prior to their departure, they did not hesitate.
梅伊辗转寻找司机，万不得已时，还拔打过110和120寻求帮助。
Mei tosses around looking for the driver and, as a last resort, calls 110 and 120 for help.
哺乳期的胡云云则在接到医院通知后，立即让丈夫开车相送。

社区司机疫情发生后，兼职网约车司机陈飞的车钥匙就被家人收起来了。
After the outbreak of community drivers, the car keys of Chen Fei, a part-time taxi driver, were collected by his family.
三天后，家人再三质问才得知，依旧早出晚归的陈飞，偷偷拿了备用钥匙，当起了义务接送医护人员上下班的志愿者。
Three days later, the family repeatedly asked until it was known that Chen Fei, who had returned home early and late, secretly took the spare key and volunteered to take the paramedics to and from work.
陈飞是突然动念的。
Chen Fei was suddenly moved.
“我们武汉人没有这方面的经验。
"We in Wuhan have no experience in this regard.
一开始听医院的朋友说很严重，我们口罩都没戴。
At first, my friend at the hospital said it was very serious. We didn't wear any masks.
”后来看到网上铺天盖地的消息，他这才警惕起来。
"Later, when he saw all the news on the Internet, he became alert.
某个抖音视频里，医生像军人一样连成一排，睡在地上。
In one quiver video, doctors sleep on the floor in a row like soldiers.
陈飞受到触动，在别人推荐下加入了青山区的医护人员免费接送群。
Chen Fei was touched by the recommendation of others to join the Qingshan District medical personnel free transport group.
接送群里，有医生工作十几个小时后走路回家。
In the pickup group, a doctor worked for more than ten hours before walking home.
陈飞印象最深的乘客是护士梅伊。
Chen Fei's most impressive passenger was nurse May.
大年初一中午，梅伊从黄冈武穴市出发，回武汉华润武钢总医院上班。
New Year's Day at noon, Mayi from Wukuen City Huanggang, back to Wuhan Huarunwu Steel General Hospital work.
从老家到单位不到100公里，但梅伊出价1000元才找到司机。
It was less than 100 kilometers from home to work, but May paid 1,000 yuan to find the driver.
黄冈司机只能将她送到两市交界的龚家岭收费站，后半程需要陈飞接力。
Wong Kang driver can only send her to the junction of the two cities Gong Jialing toll station, the latter half of the need for Chen Fei relay.
一上陈飞的车，梅伊就哭了起来。
Once in Chen Fei's car, May began to cry.
“家人并不同意她回武汉，她也是做了很艰难的思想工作。
"Her family did not approve of her returning to Wuhan, she also did very difficult ideological work.
”一个提前到岗的室友已经疑似感染了新冠肺炎，这让梅伊既伤心又害怕。
A roommate who arrived early was suspected of contracting pneumonia, making May both sad and fearful.
即便如此，陈飞在接送群里发现，自封城至今，每天仍然有不少医护人员从外地赶回武汉。
Even so, Chen Feifei found in the pick-up group, self-proclaimed city so far, every day many medical personnel from the field back to Wuhan.
群成员不断壮大，陈飞所在的3个群，如今已汇集1000多名志愿者。
The group's membership continues to grow, and Chen's three groups now bring together more than 1,000 volunteers.
1月26日，为了限制人员流动，武汉中心城区区域实行机动车管制。
On January 26, in order to restrict the movement of people, Wuhan central urban areas to implement motor vehicle control.
与此同时，为保障社区居民应急出行问题，武汉交通部门征集了6000辆出租车或网约车，直接进社区服务。
At the same time, in order to ensure that the community residents emergency travel, Wuhan traffic department collected 6,000 taxis or online cars, directly into community services.
武汉共计1159个社区，每个社区至少配车4辆，由社区居委会统一调度使用。
Wuhan, a total of 1,159 communities, each community with at least 4 cars, by the community-based unified dispatching and use.
陈飞报名成为社区司机的一员，比以往跑得更勤了。
Chen Fei enrolled as a community driver, running more often than ever.
他每天清早7点出门，先送医护人员上班，再到东山亭社区报到。
He goes out early every morning at 7: 00 a.m. and takes his paramedics to work and reports to the Dongshan Ting community.
按要求，他需要对每名乘客先行测体温排查，因为发热病人只能由救护车运送。
He was required to take a temperature check of each passenger, as the febrile patients could only be transported by ambulance.
这几日，他每天都会遇到发热的病人。
These days, he encounters febrile patients every day.
1月28日这天，陈飞一共出车6趟，其中有两趟送的都是去中南医院做肾透析的乘客。
On January 28, Chen flew six trips, including two to Zhongnan Hospital for kidney dialysis.
因为一些医院被征用来收治发热患者，大量需要做透析的病人需要另寻他院。
Because some hospitals have been requisitioned to treat febrile patients, a large number of patients in need of dialysis need to seek treatment elsewhere.
他们四处奔走寻医，成为封城后独特的一群逆行者。
They wandered about looking for health care, becoming a unique group of renegades behind the siege.
每次乘客下车后，陈飞都会把四个车门全部打开，用酒精擦拭座椅和门把手。
Each time the passenger got out of the car, Chen would open all four doors and wipe the chairs and doorknobs with alcohol.
在他的一个130多人的微信群中，有30余人都是社区司机，其中已经出现了2名感染者。
More than 30 of his 130-strong microphone group are community drivers, two of whom have already been infected.
陈飞分辨不出谁是病毒携带者。
Chen couldn't tell who was the carrier.
他不敢大意，每晚下班后，会先在楼下把防护服撕毁、装袋、扔进垃圾桶；进家门后，将衣服放在阳台，独自吃饭，把自己关在房间隔离。
Every night after work, he would tear up his suit, bag it and throw it into the garbage can. When he came home, he would put his clothes on the balcony, eat alone and shut himself up in his room.
物资运输队这是一个由500多辆车构成的庞大车队，从轿车、面包车、小货车，到带集装箱的大货车，分布在武汉各区；各区设有车队长，听从总群的协调调度。
From cars, vans and pick-up trucks to vans with containers, it is a huge convoy of more than 500 vehicles spread over Wuhan districts, each with its own team leader and coordinated movements.
如今它是武汉医疗物资的民间集散中心，各地企业或热心人士捐赠的物资，有不少经由这些车队分发，送往武汉的各家医院。
Now it is Wuhan's non-governmental distribution center for medical supplies, enterprises or enthusiasts from all over the world donated materials, many of them distributed through these convoys to the Wuhan hospitals.
“我们希望医护人员能得到足够的保护，全身心投入到救治中。
"We want the health care workers to be adequately protected and fully committed to the treatment.
”车队的组建人雪情说。
"said the team's organisers.
事实上，武汉封城之前，医疗耗材短缺的危机已经发生了。
In fact, Wuhan before the closure of the city, the shortage of medical supplies crisis has occurred.
提前得知情况的雪情联合身边朋友，第一时间在网上发起募捐。
Know the situation in advance of the snow situation in association with friends around the first time online launch fund-raising.
1月23日起，二十多家武汉医院陆续通过网络，向社会公开征集口罩、防护服等医疗物资。
Since January 23, more than 20 Wuhan hospitals have been collecting medical supplies such as masks and protective clothing from the public through the Internet.
更多的民间力量响应，试图帮助医院摆脱困境。
More civilian forces responded, trying to help the hospital out of trouble.
然而，同一时间，武汉启动封城，进出通道关闭，大量运输物资的车辆无法进入。
However, at the same time, Wuhan initiated the closure of access roads, a large number of vehicles to transport supplies can not enter.
发现这个问题后，雪情等人一方面利用当地车友群组建车队，招募大量的司机志愿者，另一方面协调有关部门，为志愿者们开辟绿色通道。
After discovering the problem, Snowflake and others used local groups of motorists to form convoys, recruit large numbers of volunteer drivers and coordinate departments to create a green channel for volunteers.
他们组建了信息搜集、仓库管理、物资运输等小组，核实好各方供需信息后，再把运输任务层层下发给司机志愿者。
They set up information collection, warehouse management, material transportation and other groups to verify the supply and demand of the parties, and then transport task layer after layer to the driver volunteers.
接到任务的司机随后到武汉各高速路口接货，然后将物资运抵市内各医院一线。
The drivers were then sent to Wuhan to pick up the goods at the various high-speed junctions, and then supplies to the city's hospitals.
“本来司机接到货后，是要先拉回仓库的，但是这两天疫情比较严重，我们就让他们拿到货后直接去发，发完再回仓库结算登记。
"The driver was supposed to take the goods back to the warehouse first, but the two days of the outbreak were more serious, we let them get the goods and send them directly to the warehouse after the completion of the settlement registration.
”雪情说。
'said the Snow Man.
资源终究是有限的，志愿者们需要判断不同医院的轻重缓急，将物资优先派发给最为急缺者。
After all, resources are limited, and volunteers need to judge the priorities of different hospitals and prioritize the distribution of supplies to the most needy.
1月25日，蕲春县疾病防控中心主任向雪情求助，当地已经有医务人员因为防护问题被感染了。
On January 25, Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon disease prevention and control centre asked for help in the case of snow.
雪情答应帮他调配200套防护服和1万个口罩。
Snow promised to help him mix 200 suits and 10,000 masks.
但第二天，团队得知湖北省妇幼保健院与武汉大学附属中南医院物资即将告罄，医护人员的工作状态近乎“裸奔”，便决定将已有物资先给他们。
But the next day, the team learned that the Hubei Maternal and Child Health Center and Wuhan University attached to the Zhongnan Hospital were running out of supplies.
“每家医院都在想方设法为各自的医护人员寻求保护，不过医院之间也很体谅。
"Every hospital is trying to find ways to protect its own staff, but hospitals are also considerate.
”雪情提到，两天前他们给武汉市普爱医院送物资，但普爱医院得知另一家医院情况更严重后，主动提出先送给对方。
Snow mentions that two days ago they delivered supplies to Wuhan's Pu-ai Hospital, but Pu Ai Hospital offered to give it to her after learning that another hospital was in a worse condition.
组建车队后，打动雪情的事每天都在发生。
After the formation of the convoy, the snow moved every day.
1月25日，有个志愿者送物资时，对接的医生临时上了手术台抢救病人，没接到电话。
January 25, a volunteer to deliver supplies, docking doctors on the temporary stage to rescue patients, did not receive a call.
司机等得着急，因为跟另一家医院的医生约好接他下班，时间快到了。
The driver had to wait because it was almost time to pick him up from work at another hospital.
他后来先去接人，接完后没顾及吃饭，又赶回医院完成物资交接。
He later went to pick up people, after the food did not take into account, and rushed back to the hospital to complete the handover.
1月26日晚上，另一个志愿者去仙桃接货，车轮陷进沟里，手机也没电了。
On the night of January 26, another volunteer went to the nectarine to pick up the goods. The wheels sank into the ditch and the cell phone ran out of electricity.
在野外了耗了一夜后，得救的他马不停蹄赶赴仙桃，向团队表态“没接到物资就不回来”。
After a night in the wild, the saved man rushed to the peach and said to the team, "If you don't get the supplies, you won't come back."
局势越来越紧张了。
The situation has become increasingly tense.
继封城之后，1月26日0时起武汉再行“封区”政策——除经许可的保供运输车、免费交通车、公务用车外，中心城区区域实行机动车禁行管理。
Following the closure of the city, Wuhan has followed the policy of "zoning" since 0000 hours on January 26 - motor vehicles are banned in central urban areas, except for licensed supply vans, free transport buses and official vehicles.
这意味着，私家车不能再自由流动。
This means that private cars can no longer move freely.
雪情连夜去找政府和有关部门协商，最终成功领到志愿者通行证。
Snow overnight to consult with the government and relevant departments, and finally succeeded in getting a volunteer pass.
1月26日晚，湖北省委副书记、省长王晓东在新闻发布会上提到，“尽管通过各方面努力，紧缺有所缓解，但仍然是当前面临的最突出、最紧迫的问题之一。
"Despite the efforts made, the shortage has eased somewhat, but it remains one of the most prominent and pressing problems facing the country," Wang Xiaodong, vice-secretary of the Hubei provincial Communist Party and governor of Hubei province, said at a news conference.
”雪情的微信里，各志愿者群消息不断，随时都有找上门的捐助者和寻求捐助者。
In the snowy micro-letters, the volunteer groups are constantly being informed, ready to come to the donor community and seek donors.
“物资依然很缺。
"Supplies are still in short supply.
朗朗、小A、希希、小曦、区长、孟高管、阿正、好好先生……我每天都提醒一块努力的伙伴，别自己舍不得穿防护服，光顾着别人了。
Lang Lang, A, Xi Xi, Xiaoxi, district mayor, Meng executive, Ah Zhen, good Mr.... I remind a hard-working partner every day, do not be reluctant to wear protective clothing, patronize others.
”看不见的陪伴者对每个从武汉站下车的人，乘务员都会郑重提醒：一旦出站，短时间内你将无法离开这座城市。
The invisible companion solemnly warned everyone who got off at Wuhan Station that you would not be able to leave the city for a short time once you were out.
武汉街头，零星行人步履匆匆，连排商户闭门歇业，间或有诊所虚掩着门。

她是宜昌人，30年前因为求学来到武汉。

她认为武汉人说话的口吻，没有南方人的柔和，又不像北方人那么干脆，刚来时一度很不习惯。
