作者：严月茹来源：商业人物（ID：biz-leaders）武汉突如其来的疫情，打乱了所有人的生活节奏。
The sudden outbreak of Wuhan has disturbed the rhythm of everyone's life. The sudden outbreak of the disease in Wuhan has disturbed the rhythm of everyone's life.
作为武汉本地民营喜剧团果然戏剧的老板，张一天觉得自己只能撑到5月。
Wuhan as a local private Xi drama company is indeed the boss of the drama, Zhang felt that they can only last until May.
如果6月还不能恢复演出，可能就要“爆炸了”。
If the show does not resume in June, it may "explode."
以下是张一天的自述：从小我就喜欢相声，18岁的时候拜了师。
The following is a one-day self-talk: I have loved cross talk since I was a child, and worshiped my teachers when I was 18.
我师傅是潘海波先生，他是武汉市唯一的马三立的第三代传人，还是武汉市级的非物质文化遗产，南方单口相声的传承人。
My teacher is Mr. Pan Haibo, who is the only third-generation descendant of Ma Sanli in Wuhan city, and the incorporeal cultural heritage of Wuhan city, the inheritor of the southern monologue.
但当时听家里的话，为了养活自己，就去了电台当主播。
But then listen to the words of the family, in order to feed themselves, went to the radio station as anchor.
毕业以后，我直接进了湖北省广播电视总台，做了15年经济广播主播。
After graduation, I went directly into Hubei province TV and radio station, did 15 years of economic broadcasting anchor.
这期间，我在大学里做相声免费推广。
Meanwhile, I did cross talk promotion in university for free.
25岁，我认识了我的第一波徒弟。
I met my first apprentice when I was 25.
我说我太年轻了，收不了徒弟。
I said I was too young to take in an apprentice.
我师傅说：没事，有我呢，我在这儿镇着。
My master said, It's all right. I'm here in town.
因为我是免费教，我师傅说，“宁赠一锭金，不传一句春”。
Because I teach for free, my teacher said, "I would rather give a ingot of gold than a spring."
真的都教出去了，我们就显得“太贱”，所以不如给个名分。
Really teach out, we appear to be "too cheap", so it is better to give a title.
2015年我正式辞职，专门做剧团。
In 2015, I officially resigned to work as a theater company.
2016年底，我离开了自己创办的第一个剧团，第一次创业相当于失败。
By the end of 2016, I had left my first theater company, and my first venture had been a failure.
我创办的第二个剧团，名叫果然戏剧，它存在的历史并不长，算起来的话才三年。
The second troupe I founded, named Sure enough, was only three years old, not long after its existence.
我们目前跟商业综合体开发商进行合作，这种模式在国外是很常见。
We are currently working with commercial complex developers, and this model is common abroad.
一个商业综合体，除了商业，还要考虑文化性。
A business complex, in addition to business, has to consider cultural aspects.
文化，可以提高它的辨识度。
Culture, can improve its recognition.
商业综合体在武汉这种二、三线城市生存，挑战并不小。
The commercial complex in Wuhan, the second and third-tier city to survive, the challenge is not small.
据我了解，在武汉，依靠票房解决剧团的运营，跟商业体合作运营的剧场中，活下去的只有我们这一家。
As far as I know, in Wuhan, we are the only one that lives in theatres run in partnership with commercial entities, relying on box-office solutions.
2020年，我们刚刚稳住阵脚，初步形成规模。
By 2020, we are just starting to take hold.
现在有两个产品比较稳定。
Two products are now relatively stable.
一个是我们的原创小剧场舞台剧，惊悚类喜剧，《死神来了之黄泉旅行社》。
One is our original theater stage play, horror comedy, "Death to the Yellow Spring Travel Agency."
还有一个是《国潮相声大会》。
Another is the National Tide Cross-talk Congress.
我们目前的内容都是原创。
Our current content is original.
这是有商业考虑的。
There are commercial considerations.
原创最便宜，只耗费精力和时间成本。
Original is cheapest, consume energy and time cost only.
对于不知名的人来说，你不繁忙，那最不值钱的就是时间和精力，与其浪费掉，还不如投入到做原创上。
For unknown people, you are not busy, then the most worthless is time and energy, rather than waste, rather than invest in original.
疫情对我们打击最大的，应该是好不容易建起来的观众群。
The hardest hit by the epidemic should be the hard-won audience.
不知道在疫情之后，需要多长时段来恢复。
It is not known how long it will take to recover from the outbreak.
即使告诉我明天就解除封城，大家可以照常上班了，我对这个市场还是没有信心。
Even if I were told to lift the blockade tomorrow, everyone could go to work as usual. I still have no confidence in this market.
抗击疫情，不能到密闭空间聚集。
Fight the epidemic. Don't gather in confined spaces.
而我们小剧场就是一个密闭空间，而且还要聚集，全都占了。
And our little theater is a closed space, and we have to gather, all occupied.
我们能够正常上班见面、排练，可能要到3月份。
We can meet and rehearse regularly at work, probably until March.
要等到观众能够回来看戏，恐怕要到5月份，这还是乐观的估计。
Until the audience can come back to the theatre, I'm afraid it will not be until May, which is an optimistic estimate.
我们是一个地地道道的武汉本土剧团，核心成员有十几个，所有人都在武汉，都困在家里。
We are a real Wuhan local troupe, core members of more than a dozen, all in Wuhan, are trapped at home.
还有一个重要的兼职演员在外地，但也在湖北。
There is also an important part-time actor in the field, but also in Hubei.
他们家那座城市也封了，现在也出不了门。
Their city is closed, and now it can't leave the house.
以前，我们每周的周五、周六和周天以及节假日都会演。
Before, we used to perform on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays and holidays every week.
《国潮相声大会》的最后一场演出是在2019年的12月31号，当时在跨年。
The last performance of the National Tide Cross-talk Conference was on December 31, 2019, in the middle of the year.
现在曝出去，人家一定会说，你看疫情很严峻，你们这里还聚集。
Now, exposure, people will say, you see the epidemic is very serious, you still gather here.
但我们当时不知道。
But we didn't know.
我们一个顾问老师，他当时在北京拍戏。
We had a counselor who was filming in Beijing.
12月31号左右他跟我讲，武汉可能爆发疫情了。
Around December 31 he told me that Wuhan might have an outbreak of the disease.
我那个时候说，政府在控制，不会拖到过节后。
I said at the time that the government was in control and would not wait until after the holidays.
首先我是相信政府，第二个，你不愿意相信拖到过节后会是一个什么状况。
First, I believe in the government, and second, you don't want to believe what it will be like to put off the holidays.
现在完全超出大家的预期。
It is now completely beyond everyone's expectations.
疫情之下，你能不能把你之前的工作、事业，企业继续坚持下去，这其实很重要。
Under the epidemic situation, can you take your previous work, your career, the enterprise to continue to persist, this is really very important.
我们是一个喜剧团体。
We are a comedy group.
疫情面前，戏剧也好，喜剧也好，都有社会作用。
In the face of the epidemic, drama and comedy have a social role to play.
首先要活着，要强调它的娱乐性，接着要承担社会责任感，通过喜剧形式，跟大家探讨一些人性方面的东西。
First of all, to live, to emphasize its entertainment, then to assume a sense of social responsibility, through comedy form, to discuss some of the human aspects.
我目前的计划也很简单，这段时间修改我们现有的剧本，创作和疫情相关的剧本。
My current plan is also very simple, this time to revise our existing screenplay, create relevant scripts related to the epidemic.
这也就是练内功的时候。
This is when you practice your internal work.
之后如果可以见面，却不能演出的情况之下，我们可能会着重的把以前一些段子、剧目拿出来重新排练，准备迎接以后的演出。
After that, if we can meet, but can not perform, we may focus on some of the previous paragraphs, repertoire out to rehearse, ready for future performances.
线上我们可能也会做一些努力，维持现在的观众群，不要流失掉就可以了。
On-line, we might also try to maintain our current audience. Just don't lose it.
如果可以实现线上的营收，在5月份之前，线上营收情况很好，我们可能会制定相关的计划，迅速做一些线上的事情。
If you can achieve online revenue, by May, the online revenue situation is very good, we may make relevant plans, do some online things quickly.
去年五一的时候，我们剧团稳步开始稳定住观众缘，也是从去年5月份开始，票房开始上升。
Last May, our troupe steadily began to stabilise its audience base, and the box office began to rise again last May.
我们的《国潮相声大会》，到了下半年，只要一到重要场次，票房都能破万。
Our "National Tide Cross-talk Congress," in the second half of the year, as long as one important number, box office can break 10,000.
对于小剧场来讲，票价很便宜，80块钱一张票，有的还打五折。
For smaller theaters, the price is very cheap, 80 yuan a ticket, some even a 50% discount.
座位数也非常有限，有些小剧场最多坐200人。
Seats are also very limited, with some smaller theatres with a maximum seating capacity of 200.
我们也没有做什么相应的宣传，在武汉就这么单纯地卖，我觉得票房破万很不容易。
We did not do any corresponding publicity, in Wuhan so simple to sell, I think the box office broke down very not easy.
今年下半年，我们剧团想维持住去年的同期水平都难。
In the second half of this year, our troupe struggled to maintain the same level as last year.
现在员工基本工资是我在发，但不能老这样。
I'm making the basic salary right now, but I can't go on like this.
而且最重要的是，基本工资是杯水车薪，大家家里负担都挺重。
And the most important thing is that the basic salary is a small amount of money, everyone is very heavy burden.
要么有孩子，要么有房贷。
Either you have children or you have a mortgage.
疫情到5月份我们还能承受，要是拖到了6月份了，我觉得会艰难的很。
We can handle it until May, and I think it's going to be tough until June.
不光是我们，我觉得整个武汉市都艰辛。
Not just us, I think the whole city of Wuhan is hard.
大概一周前，我妈妈犯眩晕，开始几天，还能下床活动一下，管点家里的事，后来就不能下床了。
About a week ago, my mother was dizzy, and for a few days she was able to get out of bed and do some housework, but then she couldn't get out of bed.
我爸身体也不好，他有一些老年慢性病，生活上有一点需要别人帮助。
My dad is not in good health either. He has some chronic diseases in his life and needs help from others.
我楼下的药店没有药。
There's no medicine in the drugstore downstairs.
剧团的另外一个同事，帮我从别的地方买了送到家里。
Another co-worker of the troupe helped me buy it from somewhere else and take it home.
现在母亲的病情才大有好转。
It is only now that my mother is getting better.
这真的不是段子，现在武汉所有的人都要庆幸自己没得病。
This is not really a paragraph, now all the people in Wuhan to congratulate themselves on not getting sick.
这几天因为家里两个老人，没办法搞创作。
There are two old people in my family who can't create these days.
因为我是核心，我要带着大家。
Because I am the core, I want to take everyone.
所以7号左右，我就跟大家讲，暂时先停一下。
So about the 7th, I'm going to tell you all to stop for a while.
他们也表示理解，现在家里的事最重要，家人的健康最重要。
They also expressed their understanding that family matters most and that the health of the family is the most important thing.
