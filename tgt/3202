澎湃新闻记者 何念台眼下，随着复工复产陆续推进，公共交通疫情防控也愈发重要。
He Niantai, a journalist in Pai Pai, is increasingly important for public transport prevention and control as work resumes.
澎湃新闻（www.thepaper.cn）注意到，近日，有研究以一起乘坐公共交通引发13人感染的聚集性疫情为案例，探讨密闭环境下气溶胶传播的可能性。
The surging news (www.thepper.cn) notes that a recent study looking at the possibility of aerosol transmission in closed environments cites a case of a mass epidemic involving 13 people on public transport.
研究发现，新型冠状病毒传播能力较强，在密闭空调车厢内传播距离最远达4.5m，病毒至少在30分钟内可漂浮在空气中并导致感染发病。
The study found that the new coronavirus transmission capacity is strong, in the closed air-conditioned compartment transmission distance of up to 4.5 m, the virus can float in the air for at least 30 minutes and cause infection to develop.
因此，建议搭乘公共交通工具时做好个人防护，同时保证公共交通工具内的换气和新风量，做好车厢内的清洁消毒。
Therefore, it is recommended to take public transport to do a good job of personal protection, while ensuring the ventilation and ventilation in public transport, cleaning and disinfection.
1人乘大巴，致同车8人感染该研究题目为《一起在公共交通工具内气溶胶传播的新型冠状病毒肺炎聚集性疫情流行病学调查》，由中华预防医学会主办的《实用预防医学》3月5日首发。
An Epidemiological Survey of a Novel Coronavirus-borne Pneumonia Spread by Aerosols in Public Transport was launched on March 5 by the Chinese Society of Preventive Medicine.
作者包括罗垲炜、海政等人。
The author includes Lu Zhenwei, Haizheng et al.
研究介绍了一起发生在湖南省某地、由乘坐公共交通工具引发的聚集性疫情：1月28日，乙地报告1例新冠肺炎疑似病例（病例A）。
The study describes a case of a mass epidemic in Hunan province caused by public transport: On January 28, a suspected case of New Crown Pneumonia (Case A) was reported.
该患者1月22日发病，1月29日确诊，发病前第5天和第3天曾与其甲地同事李某某（确诊病例，1月16日发病）有共同聚餐和办公的经历。
The patient developed symptoms on January 22, was diagnosed on January 29, and had experience of eating and working together with his colleague Li (confirmed case, 16 January) on the 5th and 3rd days before the onset of illness.
1月22日12点，病例A（未戴口罩）乘坐甲地大巴，14点到达乙地，导致同车7人发病（病例B-病例H），此外还有一名无症状感染者（病例I）。
At 12: 00 on January 22, case A (not wearing a mask) was on bus A and arrived at Site B at 14: 00, resulting in 7 cases of the same vehicle (case B-case H), in addition to one asymptomatic infected person (case I).
1月22日15:40，病例A（未戴口罩）乘坐班车，车程约1小时，导致同车2人发病（病例K和病例L）。
On 22 January, at 1540 hours, case A (without a mask) was travelling by bus for approximately one hour, resulting in two cases of the same vehicle (case K and case L).
本起聚集性疫情传播链图 本文图片均来自相关论文当日病例A乘坐的大巴抵达乙地后，停留30分钟（停留期间车辆未做消毒处理），又载客返回甲地。
This picture comes from the bus carrying Case A on the same day of the relevant paper. After arriving at Site B, the bus stops for 30 minutes (the vehicle is not disinfected during the stay) and returns to area A.
1名乘客（病例J）搭乘该车后（座位与病例A之前乘坐过的座位临近)，1月24 日发病。
One passenger (case J) took the bus (the seat was adjacent to the one in which Case A had previously been seated) and became ill on 24 January.
据调查，病例J无其他特殊旅居史和接触史。
According to the investigation, case J did not have other special sojourn history and contact history.
该起疫情还引发了三代续发病例：和病例A同车的病例B、病例K之后分别有1名亲属发病，即病例M和病例N。
The outbreak also triggered three successive generations of cases: case B, with case A, and one relative, case K, with case M and case N.
这起导致13人感染的聚集性疫情是在怎样的环境下发生的？研究显示，病例A1月22日中午乘坐49座全封闭空调客运大巴。
Under what circumstances did the epidemic, which infected 13 people, occur? The study showed that case A1 arrived on a 49-seat air-conditioned passenger bus at noon on May 22.
该大巴一层为行李舱，二层为客座舱，车长11.3m，车宽2.5m。
The first floor of the bus is the baggage compartment, the second floor is the passenger cabin.
司机座位在最靠前的次高层，除司机外共有48个客座，车辆出站时搭乘46人，在路旁接客2人。
The driver was seated at the next highest level, with a total of 48 passenger seats in addition to the driver, 46 passengers on the way out and 2 passengers on the roadside.
病例A与车上最近的一例被感染者（病例E）之间距离不足0.5m，与最远的一例被感染者（病例G）之间距离约为4.5m。
Case A was less than 0.5 m from the most recent case (case E) and the farthest case (case G) was about 4.5 m.
据调查，病例G和病例A分别从大巴车的前后门上下车，途中也没有近距离接触行为。
According to the investigation, case G and case A got off the bus from the front and back doors respectively, and there was no close contact.
调取当时车上的视频发现，车上大部分人都未戴口罩，车上被感染的病例均未戴口罩。
A video from the car showed that most of the passengers were not wearing masks and none of the infected cases were wearing masks.
病例A1月22日中午从甲地到乙地乘坐的大巴车及被感染者（病例）座位情况1月22日下午，病例A乘坐18座空调小巴，车窗均未开。
Case A1 The bus ride from A to B and the seat of the infected person (case) on the afternoon of January 22. Case A was travelling in 18 air-conditioned minibuses with no windows open.
车长5.5m，车宽2.5m。
The vehicle is 5.5 m long and 2.5 m wide.
除司机外共有17个客座。
There are 17 guest seats in addition to the driver.
车上共12人，仅1人佩戴了口罩，车上被感染的2人均未戴口罩。
There were 12 people on board, only one of them wearing a mask, and all the two who had been infected were not wearing one.
病例A与最远的一例被感染者（病例K）之间距离约为4.5m。
The distance between case A and the farthest case of infection (case K) was approximately 4.5 m.
病例A1月22日下午从乙地到丙地乘坐的小巴车及被感染者（病例）座位情况新冠病毒在密闭环境有气溶胶传播的可能研究指出，该起聚集性疫情共发现密切接触者243人，其中10名确诊病例和1名无症状感染者。
Case A1 The possible studies of aerosol transmission of the new crown virus in a closed environment indicate that 243 people were in close contact with the case, 10 of whom were diagnosed and one asymptomatic infected person.
二代病例B的密切接触者M、二代病例K的密切接触者N之后也发病。
Close contacts with B in the second generation of cases M and II also developed after close contact with K.
并且，10例二代病例和1例无症状感染者除与确诊病例A共同暴露于大巴车外，调查发现均无其他明确的流行病学(暴露）史。
Furthermore, the investigation found no clear epidemiological (exposure) history of 10 cases of second generation and 1 case of asymptomatic infection, except for the case A, which was exposed to the bus.
2例三代病例除分别与本案例中的1名确诊病例有明确接触史外，调查未发现其他流行病学（暴露）史。
No epidemiological (exposure) history was found in two third-generation cases, except for one confirmed case in this case.
研究认为，本次聚集性疫情对于新型冠状病毒的传播方式有两点重要提示。
The study suggests that there are two important implications for the mode of transmission of the new coronavirus.
一是在密闭的空调车厢内，病毒传播距离有可能超越目前认为的飞沫传播距离（通常为1m）。
First, in a closed air-conditioned compartment, the virus is likely to travel at a greater distance (usually 1m) than is currently thought.
本次调查中，病例A乘坐的是一台全封闭空调大巴，与最远的1例被感染者（病例G）之间距离约为4.5m。
Case A was travelling in a fully enclosed air-conditioned bus at a distance of about 4.5 m from the farthest case of infection (case G).
“可能原因是在全封闭空间内，空气的流动动力主要来自于空调产生的热风推动，热空气上升可以将带有病毒的飞沫颗粒运送至较远的距离，远超过通常认识的1m距离。
"Perhaps the reason is that in a completely enclosed space, the driving force of the air is mainly driven by the hot air generated by the air conditioner, which allows particles with the virus to be transported to a greater distance than the usual distance of 1m.
”研究称，本起疫情中出现的远距离传播也提示新型冠状病毒在密闭环境内有气溶胶传播的可能性。
The long-range spread of the coronavirus during the outbreak also suggests the possibility of aerosol transmission in a closed environment, the study said.
并且，在有空调风影响的密闭环境内，新型冠状病毒的传播距离会超过通常认识的1～2m距离。
Moreover, in a closed environment with air-conditioned air conditioning, the new coronavirus will travel at a distance of 1-2 m.
二是病毒在车厢内有效存活的时长不低于30分钟，且病毒存量能够达到足以致人发病的水平。
The second is that the virus survives effectively in the compartment for not less than 30 minutes, and the stock of virus can reach the level of human disease.
如病例A搭乘的大巴在乙地停留30分钟后，一乘客（病例J）搭乘该车返回甲地，在此过程中感染发病。
If the bus carrying Case A stays at Site B for 30 minutes, a passenger (Case J) will return to Area A in the same bus, during which he becomes infected.
研究表示，本次聚集性疫情对公众、特别是搭乘公共交通工具的乘客个人防护方面有一些提示。
The study said the gathering had some implications for public safety, especially for passengers travelling on public transport.
疫情流行期间，出行人员要做好防护物品准备，按照停留时间、出行地卫生设施状况等，准备一定数量的医用口罩、免洗手消毒剂等。
During the epidemic period, travellers should be prepared with protective articles, a certain number of medical masks and hand-washing disinfectants should be prepared according to the residence time and sanitary conditions of the places of travel.
搭乘较为密闭的公共交通工具如地铁、汽车、飞机时，应全程佩戴好口罩，同时尽量减少手与公共区域的接触，避免手在清洁前接触面部。
Wear a mask all the way to a closed public transport such as subway, car or plane. Avoid touching your face before cleaning and minimize contact with public areas.
应当尽量保持空气流通，适量打开车窗，包括司机舱的窗户。
Should try to maintain air ventilation, the appropriate amount of open windows, including the driver's cabin.
如属密闭式/空调式车厢等，应将新风送风量调至最大，增加换气的次数。
In the case of closed / air-conditioned compartments, the fresh air supply should be maximized to increase the frequency of ventilation.
一般情况下车厢内每天清洁消毒1－2次，特别注意在抵达终点站下客后对车辆内部空间进行清洁消毒1次。
In general, the car cleaning and disinfection 1-2 times a day, special attention to the terminal after the arrival of passengers to clean and disinfect the interior of the vehicle once.
澎湃新闻注意到，国家卫健委办公厅2月21日印发的《新型冠状病毒肺炎防控方案（第五版）》指出，新型冠状病毒主要传播途径为经呼吸道飞沫和接触传播，在相对封闭的环境中长时间暴露于高浓度气溶胶情况下存在经气溶胶传播的可能，其他传播途径尚待明确。
The roar news noted that the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (5th Edition) issued by the National Health Commission on February 21 indicated that the main route of transmission of the new coronavirus is through respiratory droplets and contact transmission.
3月3日，国家卫健委办公厅、国家中医药管理局办公室印发的《新型冠状病毒肺炎诊疗方案（试行第七版）》也明确提到，新型冠状病毒“在相对封闭的环境中长时间暴露于高浓度气溶胶情况下存在经气溶胶传播的可能”。
The new coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment programme (experimental version 7), issued on March 3 by the office of the National Health Commission and the State Administration of Chinese Medicine, also explicitly mentions that the new coronavirus "has the potential to be transmitted via aerosols when exposed to high concentrations of aerosols for a prolonged period of time in a relatively closed environment."
同时，由于在粪便及尿中可分离到新型冠状病毒，应该注意粪便及尿对环境污染造成气溶胶或接触传播。
At the same time, due to the excrement and urine can be separated into a new coronavirus, it should be noted that feces and urine to environmental pollution caused by aerosols or contact transmission.
对于病毒存活时间，国家卫健委专家组成员、北京地坛医院感染二科主任医师蒋荣猛曾介绍，研究发现，病毒在光滑的物体表面可存活数小时。
According to Jiang Rong, a member of the National Fitness and Health Commission and director of Infection Division II at Beijing Ditan Hospital, the study found that the virus can live for hours on the surface of a smooth object.
如果温度、湿度合适，有可能存活数天，甚至可能存活达到5天。
If the temperature and humidity are appropriate, it is possible to survive for a few days, or even up to five days.
