“每个人都在拼尽全力呼吸。
"Everyone is breathing at their best.
”。
"
刚开始是发热和咳嗽，接着是明确的呼吸困难，用赵一波的话说，病毒让肺像肿了一样，进而使肺失去了呼吸的功能。
At first it was fever and coughing, then clear breathing difficulties. In Zhao's words, the virus made the lungs swell, causing them to lose their ability to breathe.
有的病人带着面罩，有的病人带着氧气管，有的病人插着管......虽然那一起一伏的动作并不足以让氧气进入血液，但拼命呼吸的声音还是充斥着武汉同济医院中法新城院区发热疗区12东的病房，大到足以让被防护服裹得严严实实的赵一波听到。
Some patients wear masks, others have oxygen tubes, some patients insert tubes... Although that one-on-one motion is not enough to get oxygen into the blood, the sound of desperate breathing still fills the 12-east ward of the French-Xincheng District of Wuhan Tongji Hospital, big enough to be heard by Zhao Yibo, who was wrapped in protective clothing.
作为呼吸内科的大夫，呼吸困难的患者他常见到，但“这次这么严重的并不多见”。
As a physician in the Department of Respiratory Medicine, he was familiar with dyspnea, but "this time it was rare."
并且，“看别人喘不上气，自己感觉也要喘不上来气了”。
And, "to see other people out of breath, their own sense of breathless."
。
.
马上就是赵一波来武汉的第三个礼拜了。
This is the third week since Zhao Yi came to Wuhan.
这一天，他刚刚结束了从头一天晚八点半到凌晨两点半的班，睡了一个自然醒的觉。
On this day, he had just finished his shift from 8: 30 to 2: 30 a.m. the day before, and had had a natural awakening.
住在医院对面宾馆五层的单间里，他不值班的时候就休息，写点东西，运动，或是阅读手头的那本《呼吸与急危重症医学探讨》。
Living in a private room on the fifth floor of the hotel opposite the hospital, he would rest, write, exercise, or read the book at hand, Breathing and Critical Medicine.
一天的24个小时被划分成四个时段，不同时段的值班时间几乎变成了他需要克服的最大敌人——担心起不来，担心漏班，“不知今天周几”。
The 24 hours of the day were divided into four periods, and the hours of duty at different times became almost the worst enemy he had to overcome - the fear of not getting up, of missing work, of "not knowing what day of the week."

出发。
Let's go.
两套衣服，一套洗漱用品，两个纸抽和二十五包方便面，这些是赵一波打包进行李的全部家当。
Two suits of clothes, one set of toiletries, two sheets of paper and twenty-five bags of instant noodles, all of which Zhao Po-po packed for Lee.
他几乎是一边收拾东西，一边和母亲解释这件事情的，但直到八点多从家里出发，他都没告诉父母自己确切的出发时间。
Almost as he packed his things, he explained the incident to his mother, but did not tell his parents the exact time of departure until after eight o'clock, when he started from home.
一小时后，他已经在吉林市北华大学附属医院与其他两位医生同事会合，再于吉林大学第二医院见到了吉林省此次支援的所有医护人员，在广场上誓师，然后等待登上去往武汉的包机。
An hour later, he was joined by two other doctors and colleagues at Beihua University Hospital in Jilin City. At Jilin University Hospital No. 2, he met all the medical workers in Jilin Province who had taken the oath on the square and were waiting to board a charter flight to Wuhan.
。
.
出发的时间比赵一波预想的要提前许多，甚至可以说是仓促。
The departure time than Zhao expected a lot earlier than expected, or even a hurry.
开始听说武汉的肺炎情况严峻，是过年前的事情了，那时北华大学附属医院的呼吸科主任，赵一波的直属领导，刚开始在开早会的时候征集愿意被调去武汉的医生。
I began to hear that the pneumonia situation in Wuhan is serious, is the past year, when the Beihua University Hospital Division of the immediate leadership of Zhao Yi, Zhao Yi, at the beginning of the morning meeting to ask for doctors willing to be transferred to Wuhan.
一年中唯一一天真正放假的年三十，不用一早去查房的赵一波在家包饺子，看电视，做饭菜，再哄两个年纪尚小的儿子，现在想来那几乎是近段时间内最闲适和放松的时光。
Instead of making dumplings at home, watching TV, cooking meals, and coaxing two young sons, Zhao Yibo, the only real holiday of the year, wanted to be the most leisurely and relaxing time in the recent past.
本应安排在初四、初五的出发日期一再被提前，从初二早上召集到医院进行统一培训，到初二凌晨一通电话的通知——当天九点就要集合准备出发。
Should be arranged in the beginning of the 4th, 5th day of the departure date has been repeatedly brought forward, from the morning of the second day of the convening of the hospital for unified training, to the second day of the first day of a telephone call - 9: 00 that day will be ready to start.
。
.
准备发给赵一波一行人的应急食物，但其实除了三餐，赵一波很少会吃到。
Prepare to give Zhao a wave of emergency food, but in fact, in addition to three meals, Zhao Yibo will rarely eat.
“有时候觉得挺过意不去的，从我看的角度来说，给我们的待遇要比武汉本地医护人员的待遇要好一些。
"Sometimes I feel sorry for it. From my point of view, we are treated better than Wuhan local medical staff.
”在赵一波看来，他们还是被当作客人来看待，比如与他们的几班倒制度相比，本地医生可能要面临一人连续值班一、两天的辛苦。
Still, they were treated as guests, according to Zhao wave, with local doctors likely to face one or two days of continuous duty compared with their multiple shifts.
同时，本地医生平时大多只能在病房休息。
At the same time, local doctors are mostly confined to the wards.
“没做到同甘共苦，从付出的角度来说，感觉我们还应该干更多的活。
"Not sharing the pain and suffering, from the perspective of paying, I feel we should do more work.
”。
"
下午五点，赵一波所乘坐的航班CZ5243起飞。
At 5 p.m., Zhao's flight CZ5243 took off.
这架包机不仅搭载了包括赵一波在内，吉林省第一批支援武汉的一百多名医护人员，还包括方便饮食、保暖用品、防护备品在内的物资。
The charter plane not only carries the first batch of more than 100 medical personnel from Jilin province, including Zhao Yi, but also includes food, heating supplies and protective equipment.
这些物资一部分给支援的医生们提供保障，一部分以省份为单位支援武汉本地的医生使用。
Some of these supplies provide support to doctors, some in the provinces and some in Wuhan.
结束约三个小时的飞行后，坐上统一调配的客车，赵一波对窗外的风景就一个感觉，“这么大一个武汉，瞅着就像城乡结合部一样，没有人也没有车”。
After about three hours of flying, Zhao Yi wave to the scenery outside the window of a feeling, "such a big Wuhan, like the urban-rural junction, no one and no car."
到宾馆安顿好之后的凌晨，赵一波才得以睡了一觉，以应付第二天上岗前的最后一次培训。
It was only in the early morning after the hotel was settled that Zhao Yibo was able to sleep for his last training before taking office the next day.
。
.
赵一波的一张照片记录了出发前的情形，登机口前，他穿着的那件在东北御寒的黑色羽绒服，显然在后来的许多天里，并不足以抵抗南方冬季特有的湿冷。
A photograph of Zhao Yi-po shows the situation before his departure, and the black feather suit he wore at the gate, which kept out the cold and cold in the northeast, was clearly not enough to withstand the cold and damp conditions typical of the southern winter for many days.
不过，武汉对于他来说拥有两种温度，一种是从酒店到医院步行距离中的刺骨寒风，一种是防护服里超过两个小时便无法忍受的闷热。
But Wuhan has two kinds of temperatures for him, one is the biting wind from the hotel to the hospital within walking distance, the other is the sweltering heat that more than two hours in a suit can't bear.
。
.
之前穿防护服都是“玩”。
Before wearing protective clothing is "play."
“在开着暖气大约二十度的室温下，只穿着内衣裤，再罩上两层雨衣，只需要呆上二十分钟，大概你就能体会穿着防护服是什么感觉了。
"At room temperature, with the heating on at about twenty degrees, you can probably feel what it feels like to wear protective clothing, wearing only underwear and a two-layer raincoat and staying for only twenty minutes.
”这大概也是第一次赵一波如此频繁地穿着防护服工作，在那不透风、不透气也不透水的服装里，汗水往下淌，脚就全都泡在汗水里。
It was probably the first time Zhao had worn protective clothing so frequently that his feet were all soaked in sweat in his impermeable, airtight, watertight clothes.
“之前穿这个都是‘玩’，比如考试或是做演示。
"It used to be fun to wear, like an exam or a demonstration.
但这一次穿它是为了保命。
But this time it was for life.
”。
"
在赵一波工作的疗区还未开放之前，医护人员熟悉病房。
Before the convalescent area where Zhao was working was opened, medical staff were familiar with the wards.
。
.
左：护目镜让赵一波的眼镜不断起雾，几乎什么都看不到。
Left: The goggles kept Zhao's glasses fogging and he could hardly see anything.
右：赵一波的防护服背后，除了名字，还有“精忠报国”四个字。
Right: Zhao wave of protective clothing, in addition to the name, there are "loyal to the country" four words.
。
.
赵一波工作的疗区有整整一层楼，共分为19个房间，可容纳50张床位。
Zhao Yibo works in a convalescent area with an entire floor divided into 19 rooms with a capacity of 50 beds.
1月28日赵一波一行医护人员到岗后开始收治病人之前，病房刚刚改造完成，普通病房变成了隔离病房，兼具患者区、隔离区、清洁区和穿脱防护服的缓冲区。
On January 28, before the medical staff arrived and began treating patients, the ward had just been renovated and the general ward had been turned into an isolation ward with patient areas, isolation areas, clean areas and buffer zones in which protective clothing was worn.
疑似患者住在单间，占据大部分的确诊患者住在最多容纳6张床的较大房间内。
Suspected patients live in single rooms, with the majority of confirmed patients living in larger rooms with a maximum capacity of six beds.
而这些患者，是全部经过了一整个流程才最终与赵一波相遇：先是自己疑似有症状，再到门诊挂号就诊，经过检查和问诊，最终通过肺部CT和假阴、假阳情况较多的新冠病毒试剂盒一起，确诊，再被门诊和急诊科确认是否该被收治进来。
These patients, however, all went through a whole process before finally meeting Zhao Yibo: first, they were suspected of having symptoms, then went to the outpatient registration clinic, were examined and examined, and finally diagnosed with pulmonary CT and Pseudo-Yin and Pseudo-Yang test kits, were confirmed by the outpatient and emergency departments.
经过大约10到15天的康复期，有的患者得以出院。
After a recovery period of about 10 to 15 days, some patients were discharged from the hospital.
另外一些，则多数因为自行在家隔离时用药不及时，或是像高龄老人或拥有基础疾病等情况，最终去世。
Others, mostly due to self-isolation when the drug is not timely, or like the elderly or have a basic illness, and eventually died.
。
.
这让几乎所有人都联想到SARS的新型冠状病毒，也让赵一波想起曾经请愿的日子。
This reminds almost everyone of the new coronavirus on SARS, and of the day Zhao once petitioned.
那可能要追溯到曾经还是初中生，且作为患者的赵一波。
It probably goes back to Zhao Yibo, who was a junior high school student and a patient.
15岁的时候，为期一年的类风湿治疗让他备受煎熬，赵一波决心以后要当个医生。
At the age of 15, he suffered from a year of rheumatoid therapy and Zhao was determined to become a doctor in the future.
非典那年，还在吉林省北华大学医学院念书的赵一波也曾请过愿，但“你见过谁会让一个孩子上前线呢？”。
Zhao Yibo, a student at Beihua University School of Medicine in Jilin Province, also asked for a wish that year, but "Who have you seen putting a child on the front line?"
在医生办公室，赵一波（左四）与小组内的全体成员合影。
In the doctor's office, Zhao Yibo (fourth left) took a picture with all the members of the group.
。
.
那做医生的经历终究还是和当初想象的不太一样。
The experience of being a doctor was, after all, not quite what I had imagined.
受人尊敬，能够看到患者康复，或是在这样关键的时刻可以奔赴支援的第一线，这些大概是赵一波能够预想到的。
Being respected, seeing patients recover, or being on the front line of support at a critical moment like this is something Zhao could have foreseen.
给自己定位为”有良知的科普知识分子”，赵一波觉得有三点最不能推脱：“为民请命，临危受命，共赴国难”，这促使直到现在，他仍像医学生的自己一样，在第一时间将自己的名字报了上去。
To position himself as a "conscientious intellectual of science," Zhao Yibo felt that there were three things he could not avoid: "to ask the people for orders, to go to the disaster together," which led him, like the medical student himself, to announce his name at the first moment.
但也很多事情并不如所想。
But there are many things that are not as good as you think.
身体上的疲劳，是赵一波在武汉支援时切身感受最深的一点。
Physical fatigue, Zhao wave in Wuhan support when the most personal feeling.
另外，自从来到了武汉，工作使他往返于宾馆和十五分钟步行距离外的医院，变成了“标准的两点一线”。
In addition, since arriving in Wuhan, his work has turned him into a "standard two-point line" between a hotel and a 15-minute walk away from the hospital.
怕在工作中产生暴露从而传染给他人，每个人都将自己封闭在居住的酒店标间内，赵一波已经“很久没说话了”。
For fear of exposure at work that could infect others, everyone would shut themselves in their hotel cubicles, and Zhao Yibo had been "silent for a long time."
寂寞，但这最大程度地保护着每一个人，对于赵一波来说，是“如果我被感染了，不会伤害到我的战友们”。
Lonely, but this maximizes the protection of everyone, Zhao wave, is "if I was infected, will not hurt my comrades-in-arms."
。
.
“我们都是一个战壕里和疾病抗争的战友”。
"We are all a comrade-in-arms in the trenches fighting disease."
在前线不分职称也不分年龄的同事们当然是战友，不过对赵一波来说，患者也是。
Colleagues who have no title or age on the front line are, of course, comrades-in-arms, but for Zhao Yi-po, so are the patients.
他们共同的敌人是病毒。
Their common enemy is the virus.
。
.
赵一波很少记得这些”战友”们的名字和面孔，但他清楚记得自己已经经手了18位病人，记得他们每一个人的准确年龄，记得他们说过的许多话。
Zhao Yibo rarely remembers the names and faces of his comrades-in-arms, but he clearly remembers handling 18 patients, remembering the exact ages of each of them, and much of what they said.
那其中包括康复出院的39岁女性患者，出院后却要面对父母全部因新冠病毒肺炎去世，不能称之为家的家；一起住进病房的母女，总是在治病时候把优先的机会推给对方；医院体检中心早期没有做好充分防范而染病的护士，正在疗区里积极配合，逐渐康复，因为“本身从事医疗行业的人最懂得怎么当患者”；也有75岁的老年男性患者，想要用生命中最后的力气拔掉氧气管、监护仪和治疗针。
Those who have been discharged from the hospital face parents who have died of pneumonia and cannot be called home. Mothers and daughters in the wards are always giving priority to each other when they are cured. Nurses who are ill in the early stages of treatment are actively cooperating and recovering because they know how to be patient.

在不透风、不透气、不透水的防护服里，医护人员可能“撑两小时都很不容易”。
In airtight, airtight, impermeable suits, it can be "hard for health care workers to last two hours."
实际上，医生需要穿1-2个小时，护士则需要连续穿3-4个小时。
In fact, a doctor needs to wear one to two hours, and a nurse three to four hours in a row.
脱下防护服后，他们会穿着这样较为方便的衣服继续工作。
After taking off their protective clothing, they will continue to work in this more convenient clothing.
。
.
与以往见到的重症患者相比，在武汉的患者让他觉得，“看到他们的样子很可怜，有些人好端端的，连这个年都没过去”。
Wuhan patients made him feel, compared to patients seen in the past, that "to see them look very pathetic, some people are so sophisticated, even this year has not passed."
赵一波情感上的波动，也来自一种自责，新型肺炎意味着未知，医治能力的有限，让作为医生的他有时候无能为力。
Zhao's emotional wobbles also come from a sense of self-reproach. The new pneumonia means the unknown, and his ability to heal is limited, leaving him sometimes helpless as a doctor.
有时他也恐惧，这并非来自新的病毒，而是透过唯一能接收到外界信息的手机，他“面对人们对新的病毒的恐惧，而感到恐惧”。
Sometimes he feared that it was not from a new virus, but from a cell phone that could only receive outside information. He was "frightened by the fear of a new virus."
。
.
但对于赵一波来说，他早已过了会陪着病人或病人家属一起流泪的阶段——这被他称为“低水平的情感共通”，在他看来，远比不上“高水平的冷静”。
But for Zhao, he has passed the stage of tearing with patients or their families - what he calls "low-level emotional co-ordination," which, in his view, is far from "high-level calm."
“我们医生和另外一个角色很相似，就是将军，你希望每一个将军在面对失败的时候是什么反应，医生在处理病危和去世的患者的时候，就应该是什么反应。
"We doctors are very much like the other character, General, what do you expect from every general in the face of failure, how doctors react when dealing with patients who are dying and dying.
”不过，在赵一波工作的疗区中，医生有时又像士兵，并且是“敢堵枪眼、敢举炸药包”的士兵，比如在面临抢救的时候。
But in the convalescent area where Zhao works, doctors sometimes act as soldiers, and are soldiers who "dare to block the hole and hold up the bag," for example, when faced with a rescue.
。
.
“抢救以心肺复苏为主，这时候，含有高浓度病毒的痰液飞沫会随着心肺复苏的动作往外传播。
"Rescuing is mainly cardiopulmonary resuscitation, when sputum droplets containing high concentrations of the virus travel outward with cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
剧烈按压的动作也让医生的呼吸量增加，有时甚至面部防护的面屏也会脱落。
Intense pressure also increases the amount of breathing a doctor breathes, and sometimes even the face screen of his face protection falls off.
”抢救也许可以将生死线上的病人们救活，但当面对新型冠状病毒，对医护人员来说也无疑是一件极其危险的事情。
"Rescue may be able to save lives on the line of patients, but when faced with the new coronavirus, medical staff is no doubt a very dangerous thing.
考虑到风险太大，后来医院迅速对ICU病房进行了改建，旨在优先用呼吸机的机器代替人工按压，但并不是每一个患者都能接受插管，几乎只有“特别清醒和一点都不清醒”的患者才能完成。
Given the high risk, the hospital quickly overhauled the ICU ward, aiming to give priority to ventilator machines over manual compressions, but not every patient could be intubated, and almost only those who were "particularly awake and not at all awake."
若只能进行心肺复苏，赵一波的解决办法，是将一个黄色、半透明的污染物塑料袋后方开一个供呼吸的孔，再套到头上。
If cardiopulmonary resuscitation was the only solution, Zhao said, would be to open a breathing hole behind a yellow, translucent plastic bag of pollutants and put it over his head.
只是无论用怎样的办法，就像所有医生面对所有患者时的第一个念头那样，赵一波想“让他活着出院”。
But in one way or another, as all doctors first thought of all patients, Zhao Yibo wanted to "get him out of hospital alive."
。

Left: The view from the hotel window.
右：去往武汉同济医院中法新城院区工作途中的赵一波。

。
.
“来的时候，说得不实际一点，就是想让病毒死在自己手里。
"When I came, it was not practical to say that I wanted the virus to die in my own hands.
人生嘛，总得有一段能配得上BGM的事情。
There has to be something worthy of a BGM in life.
”这天，赵一波刚刚睡醒，混乱的生物钟让他接近中午才吃了第一顿饭，是加了个鸡蛋的青菜肉丝面，和湖北人爱吃的莲藕汤。
Zhao Yi-po had just woken up, and his chaotic biological clock prevented him from eating his first meal until near noon, a green vegetable with an egg on the side, and lotus root soup, a favorite of Hubei people.
他的窗外看不到这次支援工作的医院，是密密麻麻的居民楼，里面住着数不清的陌生人。
Outside his window he could not see the hospital where the support was working. It was a crowded residential building with countless strangers living in it.
这些陌生人在这场疫情之前，也与赵一波毫无瓜葛，但现在他们似乎多了一重关联。
These strangers, too, had nothing to do with Zhao before the outbreak, but now they seem to have more to do with it.
只有在这里，治好了一个个患者，才会有更多家庭团圆，而远在吉林的赵一波的家人，才有可能在出门的时候摘下口罩。
Only here, cured a patient, there will be more family reunion, and in Jilin Zhao Yi's family, it is possible to take off the mask when going out.
赵一波的任务还有至少5到9周，那时候，武汉的樱花大概也开了。
Zhao Yi's mission is at least five to nine weeks away, when the Wuhan cherry blossoms may have opened.
对于从医的他来说，不论面对什么样的疾病，日后这一场场具体的战役，还会继续进行下去。
For him as a doctor, whatever the illness, the battle would continue.
