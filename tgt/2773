2月20日是我虚岁50岁的生日。
February 20th is my 50th birthday at the age of eight.
那天我在检查站的岗位上，妻子忽然打电话过来，说给我在电台点了一首歌祝我生日快乐。
I was at the checkpoint that day when my wife suddenly called and told me to order a song on the radio wishing me a happy birthday.
我一听，是我年轻时熟悉的郭富城的《对你爱不完》。
I listen, when I was young familiar with Guo Fucheng's "love you can not finish."
口述 |胡军华整理 |王 煜不知睡了多久，我醒了。
I woke up after all the sleep Wang had had with me.
看看窗外，道口的照明灯和来往车辆的灯光还很亮，让我知道还是夜里。
Looking out the window, the street lights and traffic lights are still bright, let me know that it is still at night.
时钟显示现在是后半夜，我索性爬起来，去检查站看看同事们。
The clock showed it was late at night and I just got up and went to check in with my colleagues.
这里是G60沪昆高速枫泾公安检查站。
This is the G60 Fengjing High Speed Fengjing Police Checkpoint.
道口本来就是四面透风，凌晨的寒风更是刺骨，如果只穿一件大衣还不足以御寒。
Road mouth is all around the wind, the wind is piercing in the early morning, if only wearing a coat is not enough to protect against the cold.
我对这种环境早已习惯，而他们很多是各领域来支援抗疫的志愿者，没经历过类似情况，不少还是年轻人。
I am used to this environment, and many of them are volunteers in various fields to support the fight against the disease.
一辆车开来，我们的工作人员迎上去，问情况、做登记、测体温，和平时一样认真到位。
A car arrived, our staff to meet up, ask the situation, do check-in, take temperature, as usual in earnest.
我看了看他们穿得够不够，去临时休息点确认刚换班下来的同事都有暖身体的热姜汤喝、能有取暖器暖一下手。
I looked to see if they were dressed enough to go to the makeshift rest area to make sure that colleagues who had just changed over had warm ginger soup to drink and warm their hands with a radiator.
看到这些都正常，我放下心来。
I'm relieved to see that this is normal.
最近一个多月，我每天都睡在检查站。
For more than a month now, I sleep at checkpoints every day.
也记不清楚哪天能完整地睡几个小时，只知道整个生物钟都是乱的，无论多晚的深夜，只要道口有情况，我都爬起来处理；就算合上眼，心里还一直在想着会不会又出什么新的问题，有时要靠吃药才能安稳睡上一会儿。
I can't remember when I can sleep for hours at a stretch, only I know that the whole clock is disordered, and I get up and deal with every situation that comes along the way late at night. Even when I close my eyes, I wonder if there is something new going on, and sometimes I have to take medicine to sleep peacefully.
抗疫期间，胡军华在检查站指挥室最累的还是一月底，防疫工作刚开始的那段时间。
During the anti-epidemic period, Hu Junhua was the most tired in the checkpoint room at the end of January, the beginning of the epidemic prevention work.
1月26日晚上，我接到通知，上海的防疫查控措施要升级，要求1月27日下午2点要全面开始在检查站的防控检查工作，并且明确了是“站长负责制”。
On the evening of January 26, I was informed that the anti-epidemic control measures in Shanghai would be upgraded, and that the prevention and control work at the checkpoints would begin at 2: 00 p.m. on January 27.
这就意味着，我是这道关口的第一责任人。
This means that I am the first person responsible for this barrier.
以前在这里工作时，我只需要负责公安一方面的力量；但这次除了公安牵头，我还要协调卫健、交通、城管和志愿者等多个部门，制定全套的工作方案。
When I worked here before, I was only responsible for public security, but this time, in addition to the public security lead, I had to coordinate the health, transport, city management and volunteer departments to develop a comprehensive work programme.
给我的时间不到20个小时。
Give me less than 20 hours.
其实，时间紧还不是最难的，最难的是原来我完全没有制定过这样的方案：以前无论是平时检查还是为重大活动做保障，是查人查车查物，都是看得见的，并且是有重点的抽查；但这次我们要查的是看不见的病毒，而且要每车每人必查，不能漏过任何一个。
In fact, time is not the most difficult, the most difficult is that I did not have such a program: either peacetime inspection or security for major events, inspection of cars, are visible, and focused spot checks; but this time we want to check the invisible virus, and everyone must check every car, not miss any.
再难，也要顶上去。
No matter how hard it is, try to climb it.
因为我是这个站点的总指挥，方案做不出来，这“仗”就没办法打，这个关口就会出问题。
Because I am the general director of this site, the solution can not come out, this "war" can not fight, this barrier will be a problem.
我对自己说：哪怕拼了命，也要把方案赶出来。
I said to myself: even if you fight for your life, get the plan out of here.

没有给团队做动员的时间，我让大家都先上岗，把活儿赶紧干起来，再跟他们说：这是正儿八经的战时状态，我们和“敌人”不是你死就是我活。
There was no time for the team to mobilize. I told everyone to get on the job first, get to work quickly, and tell them that this was a true wartime state, and that we and the enemy were either dead or alive.
和病毒的这场战争，总有人要奉献付出，如果害怕，你不去我不去，那最后我们所有人都会全军覆没。
This war with the virus, there is always someone to give, if you are afraid, you do not go I do not go, then in the end we will all be destroyed.
检查刚开始的一两天，道口滞留的车辆非常多，最长延伸一两公里，我的压力非常大，既要保证每车每人严格检查，还要不停想办法加快通行速度，思维和身体几乎没有一刻能停歇。
During the first day or two of the inspection, the number of vehicles stuck at the crossing was very large, extending for up to a kilometre or two, and I was under great pressure to ensure that each vehicle was strictly inspected and to constantly find ways to speed up the journey.
那几天几夜，最难最累的时候挺过去了。
Those few days and nights, the most difficult and tiring time through.
之后就要靠坚持。
And then stick to it.
站里的其他民警出于防疫的考虑，每上岗14天就轮换下去隔离14天，现在已经是第三批；而我和另外几个副站长是没有换班的，天天在岗。
The rest of the station's civilian police rotated out for 14 days out of concern for vaccination and are now in the third, while I and several other vice-presidents were on duty every day without changing shifts.
胡军华（右）和抗疫工作中的同事整个检查站，疫情防控期间最高峰时有900多个人入驻，大大小小的事情我都得负责。
Hu Junhua (right) and colleagues working on the epidemic throughout the checkpoint, during the peak of the epidemic prevention and control of more than 900 people, I am responsible for large and small things.
扛着身体和精神的双重压力，实在累得不行的时候，我就找个能坐的地方靠着眯一会儿。
Carrying the double pressure of the body and mind, really tired out, I find a place to sit and squint for a while.
我的心脏之前有点早搏，这段时间胸口有时会隐隐作痛，我怕出问题，随身把速效救心丸带着，不舒服时就吃几粒缓解一下。
My heart before a bit premature beat, this time the chest will sometimes faint pain, I am afraid of problems, with the quick relief pill, when uncomfortable take a few ease.
疫情在不断变化，对检查站的工作要求也不断在变。
The epidemic is constantly changing, as are the operational requirements for checkpoints.
最开始是要解决车流等待过久；后来加上检查车厢、劝返；复工之后物流车辆明显增多，又要想新的办法避免出现拥堵，提高检查和通行的效率。
The first was to address the long waiting period for traffic; later, to check carriages and persuade them to return; and to return to work with a marked increase in logistics vehicles, and to devise new ways to avoid congestion and improve the efficiency of inspection and access.
许多时候，我都是和同事们一起连夜研究如何改进方案。
Most of the time, I spend the night with my colleagues studying how to improve the project.
说实话，不停地想新办法，我有时会觉得脑筋不够用了。
To be honest, I sometimes feel I don't have enough brains to think about new things.
但我理解这样的要求，都是为了更好地防控疫情，让更多人得到更好的保障。
But I understand that the request is to better control the epidemic, so that more people are better protected.
胡军华通过地下通道走向车辆查控区。
Hu Junhua through the underground passage to the vehicle control area.
抗疫期间，这条通道他每天要走上十多个来回。
During the battle against the plague, he walked up and down the aisle a dozen times a day.
要打好这场“仗”，一定得把每个细微的地方做好。
To do well in this "war," we must do every nuance well.
兵马未动，粮草先行；我得保护好我们的工作人员，热姜汤和取暖器从一开始就给他们安排好。
I'll have to protect our staff. Hot ginger soup and a heater will be arranged for them from the start.
支援力量一批批不断地补充到检查站，我一遍遍地给所有人讲每一个工作细节。
The support force was constantly replenishing the checkpoint, and I told everyone every detail of the work over and over again.
最开始的时候车辆等待检查的时间比较久，我看到有的司机实在忍不住了下车跑到绿化带解决“内急”，就马上安排调来了临时移动厕所。
At the beginning of the vehicle waiting for a longer period of time to check, I saw some drivers can not help but get out of the car to solve the "urgent" green belt, immediately arranged to transfer temporary mobile toilets.
像这样的事儿，在岗一天，就要考虑和解决一天。
A day on the job like this is a day to think about and solve.
在这之前，我已经在这个检查站工作了15年。
Before that, I had been working at this checkpoint for 15 years.
检查站在地点上本来是和收费站合一的，今年元旦开始，跨省的收费站取消，我的岗位从之前的在检查站定点工作，改为负责高速上某一段的巡逻检查。
Checkpoints were originally integrated with toll booths. Beginning on New Year's Day this year, inter-provincial toll gates were abolished and my post changed from being stationed at checkpoints to being responsible for patrolling a section of the highway.
以前工作时，我几乎是与检查站一步不离；工作变动后，虽然也不算离开，我还是非常不舍。
At my previous job, I was almost a step away from the checkpoint; I was reluctant to leave even after I changed my job.
这么多年来，我对检查站就像对自己的孩子一样爱护，把守好这道关口当作一份事业在努力，检查站也成为分局里的一面旗帜。
Over the years, I have loved the checkpoint as much as I loved my own child, and I have worked hard to keep it as if it were a cause, and the checkpoint became a banner in the police station.
没想到，变化不到一个月，我又以这种形式回来了。
Unexpectedly, the change is less than a month, I came back in this form.
虽然防疫工作还没有结束，但至少到目前，我想，“西南铁关”的名声应该是守住了。
Although the epidemic prevention work is not over, but at least so far, I think, "Southwest Iron Guan" reputation should be held.

17年前，我也曾对抗过疫情。
I fought the epidemic 17 years ago.
那时我在解放军411医院负责后勤保障，医院当时也建了SARS的隔离病房。
I was in charge of logistics at the 411 Hospital, which had an isolation ward for SARS at the time.
我那时穿着隔离装备，跟在医护人员后面，也经历过劳累和困难，但只要做好手头单一的事儿就行了；而这次的新冠肺炎疫情，摆在我面前的挑战要大得多。
I was in quarantine, behind the paramedics, and I had been through hard work and difficulty, but I just had to do a single thing at hand, and this time I had a much bigger challenge.
17年前我很年轻，一腔热血义无反顾；17年后的今天，虽然我已不再年轻，但心境依然如此。
Seventeen years ago, when I was young and full of blood, 17 years later, I am no longer young, but that is the state of mind.
我想这是军旅生涯带给我的影响。
I think this is the impact of my military career.
年轻时我在海军陆战队服役，那里的要求严格程度堪比特种部队。
When I was young, I served in the Marine Corps, where the requirements were as strict as those of the Special Forces.
演习时我扛着枪打着背包，靠着椅子睡觉，准备随时上前线，去风浪里搏击；参加抗洪抢险时，就是跟自然灾害的实战。
I carry a gun and carry a backpack, sleep back on the chair, ready to go to the front, to fight in the wind and waves; participate in the flood emergency, is a real war with natural disasters.
那时我明白：奉献是军人的天职，无论要为此付出任何代价。
I knew then that devotion is the first duty of a soldier, whatever the cost.
即使我已脱下军装，但这样的信念依然保留。
Even though I have taken off my uniform, this belief remains.

胡军华供图我在抗疫的岗位上，家人都很支持我，他们理解我是在执行光荣的任务，将来回忆，能感到人生是有价值的。
Hu Junhua Tu I in the anti-epidemic post, the family are very supportive of me, they understand that I am performing a glorious mission, in the future memories, can feel that life is valuable.
儿子现在上初三，三天两头嚷嚷着将来也要参军。
My son is on the third day of junior high school, yelling that he will join the army.
我家本来住在虹口，在枫泾这里上班每天来回有150公里路程。
My family used to live in Hong Kou, where I go to work 150 kilometers a day from Fengjing to work.
为了不让我太辛苦，几年前，妻子辞去原来的工作，让我把家搬到了松江。
To keep me from working too hard, a few years ago my wife quit my job and moved my family to Songjiang.
2月20日是我虚岁50岁的生日。
February 20th is my 50th birthday at the age of eight.

我很意外，也很感动。
I was surprised and moved.
谢谢你。
