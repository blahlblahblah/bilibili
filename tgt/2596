”每次出车转运新冠肺炎患者，对于武汉120救护车驾驶员王海涛而言，都是一次生命的“摆渡”。
For Wuhan 120 ambulance driver Wang Haitao, it was a "ferry" of life each time he traveled across the border with the New Crown Pneumonia.
王海涛是青海省红十字会备灾救灾和应急救护中心主任，作为一名职业救援专家，曾参与国内外地震、洪灾等多起灾害救援，不过这次支援武汉，他“跨界”当起了救护车驾驶员。
Wang Haitao is the director of the Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Response Center of the Qinghai Red Cross Society. As a professional rescue specialist, he helped rescue many disasters, including earthquakes and floods at home and abroad.
车轮滚滚，在一次次的运输使命中，王海涛感受着患者的痛苦，也分享着他们战胜病毒的喜悦。
Wheel rolling, in one transport mission after another, Wang Haitao felt the pain of the patients, but also shared their joy over the virus.
以下是他的口述：驾驶救护车在武汉空旷的街道上飞驰时，我无暇浏览这座都市璀璨的夜景。
The following is his dictation: While driving an ambulance through the empty streets of Wuhan, I had no time to see the splendid night view of the city.
我的视野里，只有前方的道路和后视镜里的后舱。
All I can see is the road ahead and the rear deck in the rearview mirror.
前者决定着这辆车的去向，而后舱的一举一动，哪怕是一声咳嗽，都决定着我车速的快慢。
The former determines the direction of the vehicle, and every movement in the rear cabin, even a cough, determines how fast I travel.
我叫王海涛，青海省红十字会备灾救灾和应急救护中心主任。
My name is Wang Haitao, director of the Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Response Center of Qinghai Red Cross.
2月9日起，我和9位同事一起奔赴武汉，承担起新冠肺炎患者转运工作。
From February 9, nine colleagues and I went to Wuhan to undertake the transfer of patients with New Crown Pneumonia.
其中，我与4名同事担任120救护车驾驶员。
Among them, I worked with four colleagues as 120 ambulance drivers.
我是一名职业救援队员，足迹曾踏遍汶川、玉树、雅安、鲁甸等灾区，并去过菲律宾、斯里兰卡以及古巴参与地震、洪灾、飓风等灾害的救援。
I am a professional rescue team, footprints in Wenchuan, Yushu, Ya'an, Ludian and other disaster areas, as well as the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Cuba to participate in the earthquake, floods, hurricanes and other disasters.
此次疫情爆发之后，我也丝毫没有犹豫，请求参加这场病毒阻击战。
After the outbreak of the outbreak, I did not hesitate to request to participate in the virus resistance war.
驾驶救护车的门槛并不高，一张A2的驾照，并且有大型车辆的驾驶经验足矣。
The threshold for driving an ambulance is not high, a driving licence for an A2, and driving experience in a large vehicle is sufficient.
所以从一名救援队员“跨界”到救护车驾驶员，对我来说并不难。
So it wasn't difficult for me to "cross the border" from a rescue team to an ambulance driver.
但在当病人运上车之后，我才发现疫情当下，这项工作的要求要复杂得多。
But when the patient got on the car, I realized that the epidemic was far more complicated.
疫情爆发之后，中国红十字会紧急支援一批负压救护车，用以转运湖北各地尤其是武汉等重灾区的患者。
After the outbreak of the outbreak, the Chinese Red Cross Society provided emergency support to a number of negative pressure ambulances for the transfer of patients throughout Hubei, especially Wuhan and other hard-hit areas.
同时在中国红十字总会驻湖北工作组的统一调度下，由四川、江苏、内蒙、青海、北京、上海、广西、吉林等省市红十字会专职人员和志愿者组成赈济和医疗救援队奔赴武汉，并承担起救护车队转运重症病患的职责。
Meanwhile, under the unified control of the Hubei Working Group of the China Association of Chinese Chaos, relief and medical rescue teams from Sichuan, Jiangsu, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangxi, Jilin and other provinces and cities rushed to Wuhan and assumed the responsibility of transferring the seriously ill from the ambulance fleet.
抵达江城后的第三天，我接到了第一个转运病人的命令。
Three days after I arrived in Jiangcheng, I received my first order to transfer the patient.
当天夜晚10点多，武汉同济医院中法新城院区打来电话，说有一位病患病情恶化，急需转运至重症监护室抢救。
More than 10: 00 that night, Wuhan Tongji Hospital in the French new city district called to say that a patient has deteriorated, the urgent need to transfer to intensive care unit rescue.
两个病区分别在该院的C栋与B栋，步行距离不超过500米。
The two areas are located in the C and B buildings of the compound, within a walk distance of no more than 500 metres.
但是由于患者血氧饱和严重不足，稍有颠簸会造成病情进一步恶化，因此请求救护车将其送达。
However, due to severe hypoxemia, a slight bump can cause further deterioration, so an ambulance is requested to deliver the patient.
我的车辆准时、准点出现在C栋楼下，患者也被同时运输至上车地点。
My car was on time and on time at C-building downstairs, and the patient was transported to the bus site at the same time.
昏暗的灯光下，我看到女患者瘦弱枯槁的身体蜷缩在推车上，胸口剧烈起伏显示出她对于氧气的渴望。
In the dim light, I saw the emaciated body of a woman curled up in a cart, her chest heaving with a desire for oxygen.
这是我第一次如此真切的接触新冠肺炎患者。
This is the first time I've been so exposed to patients with new crown pneumonia.
她的家人此刻在哪里？他们会不会还不知道患者情况恶化的消息？如果她没能挺住，家人该如何渡过难关？无数种遐想快速略过脑海，我越想越难受，只得加速启动车辆。
Where is her family now? Are they unaware of the worsening condition? If she doesn't, how will her family survive? The more I think about it, the more I have to speed up the start of the car.
车辆行驶在密布着减速带的院区内，我尽可能减慢车速来减轻颠簸。
I slowed down as much as I could to ease the bumps as I drove around the yard with the deceleration belt.
努力看清道路的同时，我不时通过后视镜观察后舱的情况，仔细打量着车速对患者的影响。
As I tried to see the road, I looked in the rear view mirror now and then to see how the speed affected the patient.
500米的路途，我开了足足5分钟。
I drove five minutes on the 500 meters.
这与我此前粗犷的驾驶风格截然相反，犹如将一颗脆弱的鸡蛋握于手心。
This is the opposite of my rugged driving style, which is like holding a fragile egg in my hand.
好在，最终病人平安抵达了。
Fortunately, the patient arrived safely at last.
在武汉驾驶救护车期间，我自认为是一名“摆渡人”，无论路程的远近，都是在为患者们赢得一线生机。
During the driving of an ambulance in Wuhan, I thought I was a "ferryman," no matter the distance, is to win a glimmer of life for the patients.
所以无论吃多大的苦，我都觉得值得。
So no matter how much pain I eat, I think it's worth it.
我们驾驶员是三班倒，穿上防护服后就不能中途脱下，所以驾驶期间不能进食、如厕。
Our driver is on three shifts and cannot be taken off the way after wearing protective clothing, so he cannot eat or use the toilet during driving.
因此，我们需在饮食方面保持克制。
Therefore, we need to exercise restraint in our diet.
下榻酒店的早餐有稀饭、豆浆与油条。
Breakfast at the hotel includes porridge, soy milk and slices of oil.
但即便可口，我们也不能贪口腹之欲，因为这些都会增加我们的如厕次数。
But even if it's delicious, we can't crave it because it increases the number of times we use the toilet.
后来，我们想到了喝“术能饮料”来解决驾驶途中不能进食的问题。
Later, we thought of drinking "energy drinks" to solve the problem of driving without food.
所谓“术能饮料”，原本是给手术中的患者保证能量的一种补给品，一般一瓶饮料下肚，我们开一天车也不会有饥饿感。
The so-called "energy drinks", originally to ensure the energy of patients in the operation, usually a bottle of drinks, we do not drive a day hungry.
同时，我们10个人还在人生中第一次穿上成人纸尿裤。
At the same time, 10 of us wore adult diapers for the first time in our lives.
生活作息习惯理顺后，青藏高原上成长的我们在昼夜不停的高负荷运转中，应对自如。
Life habits straighten out, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau growth in the round-the-clock high-load operation, with ease.
2月22日晚上，我们还给同事郗汇聪举行了33岁的生日庆祝仪式：一块蛋黄派，外加几个打火机“冒充”的生日蜡烛。
On the evening of February 22, we also held a 33-year-old Chi Chi Chi's birthday celebration: a piece of eggplant and a few "fake" birthday candles.

还记得一天晚上，我接到命令，需要从一所隔离酒店接送一名疑似病例去做CT检查。
I remember receiving an order one night to pick up a suspected case from an isolated hotel for a CT scan.
患者是一位十分年轻的女孩。
The patient is a very young girl.
上车后，便沉默的坐在后舱一言不发，表情忧郁。
After getting on the bus, he sat in the back cabin in silence, his face sad.
陪护的医生不敢打扰，同样保持沉默。
The accompanying physician did not dare to disturb him, but remained silent.
这一趟寂静无声的旅程有30多公里的路程，几乎要横穿整个武汉。
This silent journey is more than 30 kilometers, almost across Wuhan.
三个小时后，等女患者做完检测再回到车上时，我通过后视镜看到她明显开朗了不少，脸上写满了激动，并主动和随车医生报喜，“我诊断没问题。
Three hours later, when the woman had finished the test and returned to the car, I saw in the rearview mirror that she was visibly relieved, her face was full of excitement and I volunteered to congratulate the doctor on her trip.
”我也为她高兴，返程的路上，我的心情如同车速一样飞扬。
"I was happy for her, too, and on the way back, my mood soared like a speeding car.
疫情之下，每当患者病情趋好时，我们都能第一时间分享到他们的喜悦，我们驾驶员的心情也随之波动。
When patients get better, we can share their joy for the first time and our driver's mood fluctuates accordingly.
有一次接送的一位患者很开心的跟我说，我马上要好了，可以出院了，还和我比了一个“赞”。
One patient was very happy to tell me that I would soon be better, can be discharged from hospital, and I compared a "good."
患者向王海涛比出了一个赞。
The patient gave Wang Haitao a compliment.

那一刻，我流泪了，感受到了生命的坚韧。
At that moment, I cried and felt the tenacity of life.
坦白来说，此次参加武汉救援行动中，这不是唯一一次掉泪，有时是为患者所经历的苦难所哀痛，有时也是为他们的坚强所感动……好在这样的眼泪，渐渐地以喜悦与感动为主，因为我们运送的病人愈来愈少。
Frankly speaking, in this rescue operation in Wuhan, this is not the only tears, sometimes for the suffering of patients, sometimes also moved by their strong... Fortunately, such tears, gradually with joy and moved, because we transport fewer and fewer patients.
武汉的天气也在变好。
The weather in Wuhan is also improving.
好几次开车都经过武汉黄鹤楼。
Several times driving through Wuhan Yellow Crane Tower.
希望疫情结束那天，等我拉完最后一位出院的病人，我一定带着兄弟们去那里看看。
Hopefully, by the end of the epidemic, when I have finished the last patient discharged from the hospital, I will take my brothers there.
