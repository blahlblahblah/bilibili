编者按：据央视新闻，武汉市政府将参照北京小汤山的模式建立急救医院，建筑面积达到2.5万平方米，可容纳1000张病床，医院将在6天内建成。
According to CCTV News, the Wuhan city government will build an emergency hospital with a floor area of 25,000 square meters and a capacity of 1,000 beds, modelled on the model of Beijing's Xiaotangshan.
2003年，小汤山医疗点在对抗非典的战役中成效显著：一周建成，成为当时世界最大的传染病医院；680名病人中8例死亡，医务人员零感染。
In 2003, Xiaotangshan Medical Point achieved remarkable results in the battle against SARS: it was built in a week and became the world's largest infectious disease hospital; 8 out of 680 patients died and there was no infection among medical personnel.
“小汤山模式”会给现在的武汉专门医院建设带来什么启示？为此，果壳向曾参与小汤山医院设计的建筑师马晓临进行了了解。
"Xiaotangshan mode" will bring to the present Wuhan special hospital construction what enlightenment? To this end, the shell to participate in the design of Xiaotangshan Hospital architect Ma Xiaolin to understand.
马晓临现任中国中元国际工程有限公司医疗建筑设计研究一院建筑所总建筑师，为北京市某感染防控定点医院建筑设计负责人。
Ma Xiaolin is the chief architect of the building of Zhongyuan International Engineering Co. Ltd.
果壳：能先简单介绍一下“小汤山”的概况吗？为抗击非典，扩大突发期大量非典肺炎病患者的收治能力，2003年4月22日市政府确定在小汤山医院东北侧兴建应急临时设施。
In order to combat SARS and expand the capacity of treating the large number of SARS patients, on April 22, 2003, the municipal government decided to build an emergency temporary facility on the northeast side of Xiaotangshan Hospital.
在短短的9昼夜工期内，于郊区昌平建成2.5万平方米（含室外联廊），拥有508病房、612床位的应急战地医院。
In a short period of 9 days and nights, 25,000 square meters (including outdoor corridors) were built in Changping suburb, with 508 rooms and 612-bed emergency field hospital.
从5月1日晚开始陆续收治非典患者。
From the night of May 1 began to treat SARS patients.
小汤山医院二部因工程特殊，设计施工、安装调试速度超常，从接受任务到开工不到12小时，工作程序非常规。
Xiaotangshan Hospital II because of the special engineering, design, construction, installation and debugging speed extraordinary, from the task to start less than 12 hours, the work procedures.
各项作业平行甚至倒置，基本上是边设计、边施工、边修改、边调整，交叉突击完成。
The work is parallel or even inverted, basically is the edge design, side construction, side modification, side adjustment, cross-assault to complete.
果壳：针对“非典”这种传染性很强的呼吸系统疾病，小汤山是如何进行院内病区设计的？当时由于对SARS病毒控制在研究探索中，医院是按照传染病区设计的，并尽可能采取严密的防范措施。
How did Xiaotangshan design the nosocomial area in response to SARS, an infectious respiratory disease? At that time, the hospital was designed according to the infectious disease area and took strict precautions as much as possible because of the SARS virus control.
比如，按照传染病防控的三区（清洁区、半污染区、污染区）、三线（病人流线、医生流线、物品流线），通过有组织气流（既从清洁区到半污染区到污染区排放到室外）控制空气流向，从而达到限制病毒无序扩散，保护医护工作人员，完成隔离、治疗的效果。
For example, air flow is controlled by three lines of infectious disease control (clean area, semi-polluted area, contaminated area), three lines (patient streamline, doctor streamline, goods streamline), air flow is controlled through organized air flow (from clean area to semi-polluted area to contaminated area to outdoor), thus limiting the uncontrolled spread of the virus, protecting health-care workers, and completing isolation and treatment.
同时，设置了隔离观察病区（一人一间）和确诊病人病区（两人一间），有效防止了院内交叉感染。
At the same time, isolated observation areas (one for each person) and confirmed patient areas (one for two) have been set up, effectively preventing cross-infection in the compound.
小汤山医院部分设计图果壳：小汤山医疗点是如何快速地建设完成的？有没有什么经验，可供武汉的新项目参考？1模块化、装配式，这是快速建设的关键词“装配式”如果通俗地理解，就是房子预先在工厂里做成了一个个小盒子，这些小盒子都是标准化的；到时候只需要拉到工地，拼装、连接起来，就可以使用了。
2006-10-26 10: 16: 00 Xiao Tangshan Hospital some design drawings shell: how quickly the construction of Xiaotangshan Medical Point? Is there any experience for the new project in Wuhan? 1 Modularization, assembly, this is the key word for rapid construction.
一个例子是常见的活动板房。
An example is the common movable slab room.
这种施工相当快速。
This kind of construction is quite fast.
为了加快小汤山医院的设计速度，当时的设计方案采用了一些标准化单元；根据标准化模块，利用工作人员通道作为中轴，快速组合。
In order to speed up the design of Xiaotangshan Hospital, some standardized units were used in the design at that time; according to the standardized module, the staff corridor was used as a central axis for rapid combination.
在开工时，设计师在未知可利用的盒子房及活动板房尺寸、数量的情况下，不得已地采用了这种方法：先确定工作走道主轴及各排病房内走道中线位；再根据各施工单位能找到的可利用的盒子房及活动板房，拼装组合和改造成各排病房，由此赢得了时间。
At the start of the construction work, the designer had to use this method without knowing the size and number of boxes and portable rooms available. Time was gained by first identifying the main axis of the work aisle and the middle aisle of the rows of wards; and assembling and transforming the wards into rows of wards according to the availability of boxes and mobile panels available to the various construction units.
但由于临时找到的盒子房及活动板房规格不一，并且结构与医疗功能包括卫生间布置等有矛盾，建造结果不够理想。
However, due to the temporary found box room and movable slab room specifications, and the structure and medical functions, including toilet layout and other contradictions, the construction results are not satisfactory.
本次武汉蔡甸采用集装箱，是一个很好的想法。
This Wuhan Cai dian uses the container, is a very good idea.
集装箱的尺寸统一，非常适合大量复制、快速拼装。
Container size uniformity, very suitable for mass replication, rapid assembling.
然后，要在保证应急工程应有基本功能质量要求的基础上，再争取创造更为适用的医疗空间。
Then, in order to ensure that the emergency project should have the basic functional quality requirements, then strive to create a more appropriate medical space.
黄锡璆博士当时跟据模块化拼装式的原则免费提供给各地的临时医院示例。
Dr. Huang Xiang gave examples of temporary hospitals around the world free of charge on the principle of modular construction.
只要按图例所示把门诊、医技、ICU、病房的关系摆对，可以很快建成各种床位数的战时医院2重视无障碍设计采用集装箱建造应注意考虑好无障碍问题。
As long as the relationship between clinic, medical technology, ICU and ward is set as shown in the legend, the wartime hospital, which can build all kinds of beds quickly, should attach importance to barrier-free design Construction of containers should take accessibility into consideration.
集装箱下部的钢框架有可能导致病房与外面走廊之间出现门槛。
The steel frame at the bottom of the container may lead to a threshold between the ward and the outside corridor.
根据小汤山医院经验，虚弱病人轮椅推行、移动式检查设备推行几率较大，应尽可能满足无障碍推行的使用需求。
According to the experience of Xiaotangshan Hospital, the implementation of wheelchairs for frail patients, mobile inspection equipment is more likely to be implemented, should meet the needs of barrier-free implementation as far as possible.
3配套设施要齐全为保障周围环境卫生安全，需要在车辆出入口分别设置汽车冲洗消毒场，汽车出入院区均需要过必要消洗消毒措施。
To ensure the safety of the surrounding environment, it is necessary to set up separate disinfection areas for washing and disinfecting cars at the entrances and exits of vehicles.
太平间、垃圾暂存、污水处理站、液氧站，麻雀虽小五脏俱全。
Taiping room, garbage temporary storage, sewage treatment station, liquid oxygen station, sparrow is small all over.
还要注意风向。
Watch the wind.
这些要在建设中一并考虑。
These should be considered together in the construction.
因为一旦接诊病人再进行隔离区建设、改造，会造成很大影响。
Because once the patient is admitted to the isolation area for construction, renovation, will cause a great impact.
4因地制宜、就地取材小汤山医院的建设由于时间紧，就地取材是最最重要的原则。
The construction of Xiaotangshan Hospital is the most important principle because of the shortage of time.
当时参建的北京六大建筑公司调动了一切可以调动的资源，当然也导致所用的材料五花八门：使用了5种规格的整体式钢筋混凝土盒子式活动房以及彩色钢板面泡沫塑料夹芯复合板，护士站桌子各式各样，病房里有坐便器也有蹲便器，找到什么就用什么。
The six major construction companies in Beijing at the time mobilized all available resources and, of course, led to the use of a wide variety of materials: five-gauge reinforced concrete box-type mobile rooms and color-plate foam sandwich panels, a wide variety of nurses' tables, and toilets and squats in the wards.
在非典过后的新建传染病医院设计中，我们总结了经验教训。
In the new hospital design of infectious diseases after SARS, we summarized the experience and lessons learned.
比如，为了方便身体非常虚弱的肺炎病人使用，可能的情况下建议病房卫生间尽量采用坐便器并安装助拉扶手，方便病人使用。
For example, in order to facilitate the use of very weak patients with pneumonia, it is recommended to use toilet facilities and install handrails to facilitate the use of patients.
在小汤山外线的施工中，设计师通过计算采用了150毫米管径的给水管，但施工单位只找到了管径100的给水管，最后现场确定采用并排铺设两根100管径的给水管满足使用需求、保证施工进度。
During the construction of an outside line in Xiaotangshan, the designer calculated the water supply pipe with a diameter of 150 mm, but the construction unit found only a water supply pipe with diameter 100. Finally, the site decided to lay two 100-pipe pipes side by side to meet the demand and ensure the progress of construction.
由此可见，“因地制宜、就地取材”原则在应急医院建设中的意义。
This shows the significance of the principle of "local conditions and local materials" in the construction of emergency hospitals.
5避免水体污染武汉计划的医院建设用地靠近武汉职工疗养院，临近蔡甸区知音湖水域。
5 Wuhan to avoid water pollution planning of the hospital construction site close to Wuhan staff sanatorium, adjacent to Cai Yin Lake waters.
小汤山医院总设计师黄锡璆博士已向武汉方面提出建议，此次尤其需要采取切实措施，保证水体不受污染。
Dr. Huang Xiang, chief designer of Xiaotangshan Hospital, has advised Wuhan that concrete measures should be taken to ensure that water bodies are not polluted.
武汉这次新建的专门医院选址丨人民日报微博果壳：17年过去了，小汤山医院已成为历史。
Wuhan, the new special hospital site to the people's daily Weibo fruit shell: 17 years later, Xiaotangshan Hospital has become history.
这17年间，医院建设方面有了哪些发展呢？互联网技术的发展，使得这次新医院可与院外联成防控系统。
What developments have taken place in hospital construction in the past 17 years? The development of Internet technology has enabled the new hospital to be connected with the outside world as a control system.
黄锡璆博士已经向武汉方面建议，院外转运病人时，首先要利用网络传输病人数据资料，开展远程会诊；院内可取消探视，改用远程影像系统。
Dr. Huang Xiang has advised Wuhan that when patients are transferred outside the hospital, they should first use the network to transfer patient data and consult with their partners remotely.
从医院建设上来说，非典过后，国家立即启动了新编《传染病医院建筑设计规范》的工作，改版了《综合医院建设标准》、《综合医院建筑设计规范》，还发布了很多医院建设的法规、政府文件。
In terms of hospital construction, immediately after SARS, the state started work on the new Standards for Architectural Design of Hospitals for Infectious Diseases, revised the Standards for the Construction of General Hospitals and Architectural Design Standards for General Hospitals, and issued many regulations and government documents for the construction of hospitals.
我们国家的医院感染控制严格程度甚至超过很多发达国家。
Hospital infection control in our country is even more stringent than in many developed countries.
通常二级以上医院都按感染防控要求建设了发热门诊，各地都新建或改建了感染防控定点医院，很多三甲医院都设有感染病房。
Generally, hospitals above level II have built fever clinics in accordance with the requirements of infection prevention and control, new or improved infection control designated hospitals in various places, and many triple-A hospitals have infection wards.
相信我们这次面对疫情，会比2003年做得更好。
I believe we will do better this time around than we did in 2003.
