图片来源：pexels文：央视新闻孙牧宁近日，新加坡卫生部门通报称，一名57岁的女性同时确诊感染登革热和新冠病毒肺炎，这是新加坡首例类似病例。
A 57-year-old woman was diagnosed with dengue fever and pneumonia, the first of its kind in Singapore, CCTV news agency Sun Mourning said recently.
卫生部称，这名57岁的病患最初送医后被确诊感染登革热。
The Ministry of Health said the 57-year-old patient was initially admitted to hospital with dengue fever.
在住院后，该名病患开始出现呼吸道症状，因此接受新冠病毒筛查，确诊后随即被转到单人病房隔离。
After hospitalization, the patient began to develop respiratory symptoms. He was screened for the new crown virus and was immediately transferred to a single ward for isolation.
新加坡卫生部称，确诊登革热并不是误诊，病人的症状跟检验结果，都与登革热相符。
According to the Ministry of Health, dengue diagnosis is not a misdiagnosis and the symptoms and test results are consistent with dengue fever.
此前，也有两名登革热病患曾经被怀疑感染新冠病毒，但是均已经被排除。
Two other cases of dengue were previously suspected of contracting the new crown virus, but both have been ruled out.
目前，与她同处一室的其他患者都已经转移至单人病房，并逐一进行新冠病毒检测。
Other patients in her room have now been moved to a single ward and tested for the new crown virus one by one.
新加坡医疗专家提醒当地民众，近期如感觉有发热情况就诊时，应同时关注是否感染登革热或流感，感染一种病毒不代表不会被另一种感染，如果错过治疗时机会酿成大错。
Medical experts in Singapore have reminded local people to pay attention to the presence of dengue fever or flu when they feel feverish in the near future. Infection of one virus does not mean that they are not infected with another.
有专家提醒称，新冠肺炎导致的身体酸痛与登革热有明显不同，登革热的疼痛集中于眼窝、后背处，同时登革热病患不会干咳、喉咙痛。
Experts warn that the pain of dengue fever is concentrated in the fossa and the back of the eye. Dengue fever does not cause dry cough or sore throat.
截至2月23日，新加坡感染新冠肺炎的确诊病例为89例，尽管目前没有发生大规模暴发，但是每天依旧持续有病患确诊感染新冠肺炎。
As at 23 February, 89 cases of new crown pneumonia had been confirmed in Singapore, and although there were no major outbreaks so far, confirmed cases of New Crown Pneumonia persisted on a daily basis.
而根据新加坡环境局公布的数据，新加坡目前正处于登革热高发期。
Singapore is at a high dengue fever season, according to the Environment Agency of Singapore.
根据最新数据，新加坡今年已有2130人感染登革热，人数创2016年以来之最。
According to the latest data, 2,130 people have been infected with dengue this year, the highest number since 2016.
