“漂浮的监狱”巨型豪华邮轮百慕大籍“钻石公主号”2月18日晚上七点半，钻石公主号游轮上响起广播，提醒乘客注意自己的房间门口放着的一封信。
At 7: 30 pm on Feb. 18, the Diamond Princess, a huge cruise ship called The Floating Prison, sounded on the cruise ship The Princess Diamond, reminding passengers of a letter outside her room.
乘客们必须迅速打开门，捡起信，再关门。
Passengers must open the door quickly, pick up the letter, and then close it.
除了两天一次的放风，他们不允许离开房间。
They are not allowed to leave the room except once every two days.
这样的日子已经持续了14天，终于即将结束。
Such a day, which has lasted 14 days, is finally coming to an end.
信中，日本厚生劳动省副大臣通知了次日（2月19日）隔离期满后，船上人员下船的计划和方案。
In the letter, the Vice-Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan informed the next day (19 February) of the plans and programmes for the disembarkation of persons on board.
因为1月20日一名新冠患者曾经登上钻石公主号，不到一个月，新冠病毒在这座游轮里急遽扩散，这里也变成中国大陆之外最集中的疫情爆发地。
Less than a month after a new crown sufferer boarded the Princess Diamond, the New Crown Virus has spread rapidly across the ship, becoming the most concentrated outbreak outside mainland China.
截至目前，船上已经接受PCR测试的2404人中，感染者总数达到542人。
To date, a total of 542 people have been infected out of a total of 2,404 who have been tested by PCR on board.
这意味着船上每五人就有一个人感染。
This means that one in five people on board is infected.
为防止疫情从水域向大陆传染，日本政府要求横滨附近的海域自我隔离两周才能上岸。
To prevent the spread of the disease from its waters to the mainland, the Japanese government asked the area near Yokohama to isolate itself for two weeks before disembarking.
原本的“钻石公主号”因此被人称为“漂浮的监狱”。
The original "Princess of Diamonds" was thus called a "floating prison."
广播继续响起，要求乘客在2月19日严格遵照信中的指示，并带好行李财物，一旦下船，他们不再被允许返回。
The radio continued to ring, and passengers were asked to follow the instructions in the letter strictly on 19 February and to bring their luggage and belongings. Once off board, they were no longer allowed to return.
2月18日白天，已有医生巡查过房间，问询乘客的身体状况。
During the day of 18 February, doctors had visited the room to inquire about the physical condition of the passengers.
每个乘客领到了一张健康检查卡，统计他们的个人信息、既往病史、是否有发热或头痛、流涕、咽喉痛等呼吸器官感染症状，是否与感染者有密切接触史，以及是否进行了PCR检测，根据这些指标，医生对乘客作出是否适于下船的判定。
Each passenger was provided with a health check card, their personal information, previous medical history, whether they had symptoms of respiratory infection such as fever or headache, runny nose, sore throat, close contact with the infected person, and whether a PCR test had been carried out, according to which the doctor made a decision on the passenger's fitness to disembark.
18日中午，乘客吃了船员送来的午餐，有牛肉饭和蛋炒饭。
At noon on the 18th, passengers ate lunch from the crew, including beef rice and fried rice.
得知明天开始撤退，许多乘客等不及，要尽快回家，尝尝家里饭菜的滋味。
Many passengers couldn't wait to get home and taste the food at home as soon as they learned that the evacuation would begin tomorrow.
准备与下船2月18日，日本厚生劳动大臣加藤胜信表示，“钻石公主号”邮轮上的所有人员用于检测新冠肺炎的样本已经采集完毕。
Ready for Disembarkation Japan's Health Minister Kato Shinzo Kato said Thursday that samples taken from the crew of the Princess Diamond cruise ship had been collected to test for pneumonia.
新冠病毒核酸检测结果呈阴性、且没有与感染者密切接触过、且下船之际没有任何发热、呼吸相关症状的乘客可以从2月19日到2月21日陆续从船上撤离。
Passengers who tested negative for Nucleic Acid (Nucleic Acid), who were not in close contact with the infected and did not have any fever, respiratory-related symptoms when they disembarked could be evacuated from the ship from February 19 to February 21.
17日，18日两天，日本政府一直在加快检测，但新收集的样本检测结果最快也要两日后出来，为等待检测结果，撤离要持续三天。
The Japanese government has been stepping up testing for two days, but the latest results will be collected in two days at the earliest, and the withdrawal will last three days, pending test results.
如果乘客和船员检测结果呈阳性，则将被送入日本当地医院接受治疗。
If passengers and crew test positive, they will be sent to local hospitals in Japan for treatment.
各国大使馆都在加紧与本国乘客取得联系。
Embassies are stepping up their contacts with national passengers.
2月15日，加拿大和意大利政府决定将派包机撤离本国公民。
On 15 February, the Governments of Canada and Italy decided to send charter flights to evacuate their citizens.
2月17日，韩国和中国香港特区政府也确认包机撤侨计划。
On February 17, the governments of the ROK and China also confirmed plans to charter flights to evacuate overseas Chinese.
船上的中国乘客311名，其中有260名香港公民。
There were 311 Chinese passengers on board, 260 of whom were Hong Kong citizens.
香港保安局在17日就派出一个二十人左右，由保安局、入境处及卫生署人员组成的先遣小队。
The Hong Kong Security Bureau dispatched an advance team of about 20 officers from the Security Bureau, the Immigration Department and the Department of Health on the 17th.
2月18日，又派遣了一队八人医护小队。
On 18 February, an additional eight-person medical team was dispatched.
2月19日，撤离第一天，一共有 500人获准从“钻石公主”号游轮离开。
On 19 February, the first day of the evacuation, a total of 500 people were allowed to leave the MV Princess Diamond.
据厚生劳动省对外公布，这批乘客大多是老年人，他们先乘坐大巴去往各个公共汽车站，再从公共汽车站前往横滨站等多个站点。
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced that most of the passengers were elderly people who took buses to various bus stops and from the bus stop to Yokohama Station.
据香港保安局局长李家超声称，这500名首批下船者当中至少有20名香港人。
According to the Secretary for Security, Mr Lee Ka-keung, at least 20 of the 500 first disembarkation passengers were Hong Kong nationals.
此前在2月14日，船上超过80岁的老人已经率先获准下船。
Earlier, on Feb. 14, the boat's 80-year-old had been the first to disembark.
2月19日早上9点45分，船上响起广播通知乘客，香港政府和澳大利亚政府的飞机会在24小时内抵达横滨。
On February 19th, at 9: 45 a.m., the ship sounded to warn passengers that Hong Kong and Australian government planes would arrive in Yokohama within 24 hours.
而加拿大政府派出的飞机周五早上才能抵达。
The Canadian government's plane didn't arrive until Friday morning.
乘客里几家欢喜，几家焦虑。
There were several joys and anxieties among the passengers.
他们盯着自己的手机，随时注意大使馆的通知。
They stare at their mobile phones and keep an eye on the embassy notices.
大巴车已经开到横滨港口，从船舱的窗户望出去，港口上两排红色的路障和警戒线隔离出长长的通道。
The coach had reached the port of Yokohama, looked out of the cabin window, and two rows of red barricades and pickets in the harbor separated the long passages.
钻石公主号的乘客领到了不同颜色的行李标签，以区分自己下船的批次。
The passengers of the Princess received baggage tags of different colours to distinguish between their own disembarkation batches.
早上10点，拥有蓝色、上写着数字2的行李标签的乘客率先被通知到四号甲板的舷门处集合，等待测量体温乘客将获得一张健康卡，上面列有一旦出现症状可以联系的电话号码，以及日本政府签发的一张落地许可。
At 10 a.m., passengers with blue baggage tags bearing the number 2 were the first to be told to assemble at the gangway on Deck 4, waiting for the temperature to be measured. Passengers would be given a health card with a telephone number to contact in the event of symptoms and a landing permit issued by the Government of Japan.
早上11点，第一辆大巴驶离码头，有两名乘客选择了步行离开，他们随即被记者团团围住。
At 11 a.m., the first bus left the pier. Two passengers chose to leave on foot and were surrounded by reporters.
据钻石公主号2月18的通知，所有乘客撤离后，船员很可能将留在船上接受与乘客相同标准的继续隔离。
Following the departure of all passengers, the crew is likely to remain on board to continue to be segregated to the same standard as passengers, as advised by the Princess Diamond on February 18.
此前，钻石公主号船员的隔离条件恶劣，他们挤在狭窄的公共宿舍里，在公共餐厅就餐。
Previously, the crew of the Princess Diamond had been isolated in harsh conditions, packed into cramped public dormitories and dined in public restaurants.
隔离计划刚刚宣布时，日本政府认为因为年龄和健康的关系，乘客更容易受到感染，因而仅仅对乘客执行了更高的隔离标准。
When the plan was announced, the Japanese government said passengers were more susceptible to infection because of their age and health, and imposed only higher quarantine standards on passengers.
随着感染人数的迅速增长，尤其是大量无症状感染者的出现，这一决定暴露出了问题。
The decision exposed the problem as the number of people infected grew rapidly, especially among the asymptomatic.
钻石公主号方面如今宣布，一旦决定继续隔离船员，船员在此期间将享受补偿，隔离结束后，还将获得两个月的带薪休假。
For its part, the Princess Diamond now announced that the crew would receive compensation in the interim, as soon as it was decided to continue to segregate the crew, and two months' paid leave upon completion of the separation.
因为部分国家已宣布将派专机接走游轮上的本国公民，所以游轮上一些符合离船条件的人可能无法立即离开，他们会待在游轮上直到相关航班抵达。
As some countries have announced that they will send special planes to pick up their citizens from cruise ships, some of the people on board may not be able to leave immediately and will stay on the cruise ship until the relevant flights arrive.
而那些室友被检测出阳性的乘客，则要从室友被转移那天起，重新计算新一轮的隔离期，并再次进行新冠病毒检测。
Those whose roommates were found to be positive were asked to recalculate a new quarantine period from the day their roommate was transferred and to conduct a new crown virus test.
在新隔离期满并检测结果阴性时，才允许下船。
Disembarkation is permitted only when the new isolation period has expired and the test results are negative.
全部隔离结束后，钻石公主号将开到专用码头，接受手术室等级的严格消毒。
After the complete isolation, the Princess Diamond will drive to a dedicated dock, under strict operating room class sterilization.
尚未结束的恐慌与隔离2月16日，香港籍游客黄雅曦得知回港后要继续接受14天的集中隔离检疫，心情很沮丧。
Hong Kong tourist Huang Yaxi was dismayed to learn on Feb. 16 that she would continue to be quarantined for 14 days after returning to Hong Kong.
她在推特上发出隔离中心房间的图片，抱怨房间几乎跟船上的一样狭小。
She tweeted out pictures of the quarantine center room, complaining that it was almost as small as the ship's.
黄雅曦担心继续隔离会给家里老人和自己6岁的儿子造成心理压力。
Huang feared the continued isolation would put pressure on the family's elderly and her 6-year-old son.
过去十四天，船上一度因为无法全员检测或是缺少必备药物而引发恐慌。
For the past 14 days, the ship had been panicked because it could not be fully tested or lacked the necessary drugs.
随着隔离结束，某些恐慌情形得到缓解，但还有一些担忧仍在继续。
As the isolation ended, some fears eased, but others continued.
黄雅曦告诉《中国新闻周刊》，她知道船上有不少不同时间确诊的夫妇和朋友，因为床位不够，安排不到同一家医院，这是很多留在日本接受治疗的感染者目前最大的担忧。
Huang told China News that she knew of a number of couples and friends who had been diagnosed at different times on board because there were not enough beds to accommodate the same hospital, which was the biggest concern for many infected people who remained in Japan for treatment.
此前，钻石公主号上有一位老人和七位朋友一起旅行，因为七位朋友都70岁以上，被安排先做了核酸测试，只有这位老人69岁，当时尚未做测试，他担心如果朋友先测出感染去了其他医院，他会与这些人失去联系。
Previously, an old man on board the Princess Diamond had traveled with seven friends, all over 70, who had been given a nucleic acid test. Only the 69-year-old man, who had not been tested at the time, feared that he would lose touch with his friends if they detected an infection and went to another hospital.
另一个担忧是大量的无症状感染者出现。
Another concern is the large number of asymptomatic infections.
最新确认的88位感染者，有65人没有发烧，咳嗽等症状。
Of the 88 newly confirmed cases, 65 did not have fever, cough and other symptoms.
这对各国政府组织集中撤离时的防护工作提出了挑战。
This poses a challenge to the protection of governmental organizations in the event of a concentrated withdrawal.
美国政府给美国乘客两种选择，一种是按原计划在船上完成14天隔离，在下船后继续在日本自我隔离14天，3月4日之前不得返回美国。
The United States Government gave American passengers the option of completing the 14-day quarantine on board the ship as originally planned and remaining in self-imposed isolation in Japan for 14 days after disembarkation, with no return to the United States until March 4.
另一种是跟随美国政府2月16日派出的两架飞机提前返回美国，在本土重新开始14天的强制隔离期。
The other is the early return to the United States of two planes sent by the US government on February 16 to restart a 14-day mandatory quarantine on the mainland.
大部分美国公民选择跟机返回，但一部分公民选择留在船上，美国乘客Matthew Smith认为，将未隔离满14天，还未做过冠状病毒检测的乘客包机带回美国，是不合理的。
Most US citizens chose to follow suit, but some chose to stay on board, while US passenger Matthew Smith argued that it was unreasonable to bring back to the United States chartered passengers who had not been quarantined for 14 days and had not been tested for coronavirus.
就在一些美国乘客乘大巴去机场准备返美的途中，日本方面传来检测结果，有14名准备登机的美国人新冠病毒检测呈阳性，最终，这些患者与其他人一起上了飞机。
Just as some American passengers were taking a bus to the airport to return to the United States, Japanese tests showed that 14 Americans ready to board tested positive for the virus and eventually boarded the plane with others.
美国政府的撤侨做法也因此遭到广泛质疑和批评。
The evacuation of overseas Chinese by the US government has been widely questioned and criticized.
香港政府选择更加严格的隔离政策，所有乘客，不论选择跟政府班机直接回港，还是选择在域外停留后自行返港，在抵港后都会安排入住检疫中心接受14天的隔离检疫。
The Hong Kong Government has opted for a more stringent quarantine policy whereby all passengers, whether they choose to return directly to Hong Kong on government flights or choose to return to Hong Kong after their overseas stay, will be placed in quarantine at the quarantine centre for 14 days upon arrival.
早前，因为已有的四个隔离点人满，香港政府将一套为低收入人士准备的廉价公租公寓临时转为隔离点，并辟出269张床位，接收钻石公主号下船的乘客。
Earlier, the Hong Kong government moved from a low-cost public rental flat for low-income people to a temporary quarantine point with 269 beds for passengers off the Princess Diamond.
钻石公主号这座“漂浮的监狱”逐渐被慢慢清空，但当所有人登上陆地之后，还将等待着新一轮的命运裁决。
The "floating prison" of the Princess Diamond is slowly being emptied, but as everyone lands, a new round of fateful decisions awaits.
