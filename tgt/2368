视频会议开始前，他们会换上平常工作的衣服——这是一种仪式感，然后清空自己的背景，试图在各式各样的环境里，打造一张安静的工位。
Before the videoconference starts, they change into their usual work attire - a sense of ceremony, then emptying their backgrounds in an attempt to create a quiet workplace in a variety of environments.
不过，偶尔还是有一些特殊情况。
Occasionally, however, there are special circumstances.
很多人在视频会议室里看到了同事家的孩子在撒娇，父母在喊吃饭，还有琬鸥5岁的萨摩耶。
Many see children playing the game in video conference rooms, and Carmen, 5, of Carmen or Carmen, are calling for dinner.
有一个同事被困在老家，每天7点半晨会的时候，家里养的公鸡会准时打鸣。
There is a colleague trapped in his hometown, every morning at 7: 30 in the morning meeting, the rooster in the home will be punctual.
文｜瞿麦编辑｜萧祷                     1年初三晚上六点，琬鸥已经在浙江省卫健委工作了36个小时，只吃了一顿饭。
less than thirty-eight yesterday evening At six o'clock in the evening, Carmen Gull had worked for 36 hours at the Zhejiang Guardian Council, eating only one meal.
她是钉钉医疗团队的产品经理。
She's the product manager of the nail medical team.
大年初一的晚上，他们接到了来自浙江省卫健委的通知，对方想搭建一个新型肺炎公共服务与管理平台，希望钉钉团队可以提供技术上的支持。
On the evening of the New Year's Day, they received a notification from the Zhejiang Healthy People's Committee that they wanted to build a new public service and management platform for pneumonia, hoping that the nail-nailing team could provide technical support.
当时，团队里只有琬鸥还在杭州，只有她能到浙江省卫健委办这件事。
At the time, only Carmen Gull was on the team, and she was the only one who could do it.
大学时，琬鸥学了临床医学，曾经在医院实习和工作过。
In college, Carmen studied clinical medicine and worked in hospitals.
来到钉钉团队之后，这是她第二次有了从原来生活中跳出的体验。
After coming to the nail team, it was the second time she had had the experience of jumping out of her life.
上一次是在2019年上半年，她去浙江衢州出了三个月的差。
The last time was in the first half of 2019, she went to Quzhou, Zhejiang Province for three months.
她想看看，自己是否能够依托平台优势，为基层的医生做点什么。
She wanted to see if she could do something for doctors at the grass-roots level, building on the platform's strengths.
琬鸥有在杭州市内大医院工作的经历，这和基层医生的工作体验完全不同。
Carmen Gull has the experience of working in the great hospital in Hangzhou, which is quite different from that of the grassroots doctors.
在大城市和大医院，居民们往往是主动找上医生的，面诊的时间通常也就几分钟。
In large cities and hospitals, residents often seek medical advice on their own initiative, often for only a few minutes.
而在基层，通常是医生去患者家里走访。
At the grass-roots level, it is usually the doctor who visits the patient's home.
「基层的医生们有非常多的事务性的事情要做，比如做表格，要不断地去（做）健康教育，去宣教。
"Doctors at the grass-roots level have a lot of things to do, like doing forms, going to health education, going to missionary work.
」衢州多山地，很多医生每天都要花大量的时间爬山，才能到达病人的家里。
Quzhou is very mountainous, and many doctors have to spend a lot of time on climbing mountains every day to get to the home of the patient.
一些居民的条件确实不好，令琬鸥印象深刻的是一户失了孩子的人家，妻子是脑瘫患者，琬鸥与医生进屋时，男主人端出了饮料用以招待。
The conditions of some of the inhabitants were indeed bad, and what impressed Carmen was the loss of a family of men, a man of cerebral palsy, or men who brought drinks to the house when the men and the doctors entered.
「他把最珍贵的东西拿出来了。
"" He has brought out the most precious things.
」不久后，钉钉家庭医生产品上线，每一个单独的基层医务人员的价值，通过平台被放得更大。
Before long, nailing family doctor products went online, and the value of each individual primary health-care worker was increased through the platform.
新冠疫情当下，钉钉与浙江卫健委合作的项目，也有着同样的意义。
The new crown epidemic situation, the nail and Zhejiang Wei health committee cooperation project, also has the same significance.
这是一个面向公众，同时也服务于医护人员的平台。
It is a platform for both the public and health care providers.
居民可以在线上，完成疫情线索申报、体验医学观察服务、查询同行程确诊患者、以及在线智能问诊。
On-line, residents can complete the declaration of epidemic clues, experience medical observation services, inquire about patients diagnosed with the same trip, and consult online intelligence consultation.
在项目推出之前，每个医生需要管理几十个「网格」，在一些疫情严重的地区，一个网格里可能有几十个、甚至上百个疑似病人或密切接触者。
Dozens of "grids" need to be managed by each doctor before the project is launched, and in some severely affected areas there may be dozens or even hundreds of suspected patients or close contacts in a grid.
医生需要上门，找到这些人，一个一个地量体温。
The doctor needs to come in and find these people, one by one, to measure their temperature.
有的人不愿意开门，有的人还可能造成交叉感染。
Some are reluctant to open doors, while others may become cross-infected.
出一趟外勤，意味着消耗更多口罩等医用物资。
A trip to the field means consuming more medical supplies such as masks.
在将负责区域统计完毕后，医生们还要手动录入结果。
Doctors also need to manually enter the results after the area has been counted.
在衢州的经历影响了琬鸥。
The experience of Quzhou has influenced the Carmen.
在接到来自卫健委的紧急任务时，她已经对一线工作者，尤其是基层医生们的工作状态有了深入的了解，「短时间内，就能知道基层医务工作者会是怎样的状态，怎样跟居民（打交道）。
At the time of her emergency assignment, she had gained an in-depth understanding of the working conditions of front-line workers, especially the primary-level doctors, and "in a short time, we will be able to see how the primary care workers will be and how to deal with the residents."
基本上就是简单地沟通一下，我就大概有那个画面了。
Basically it's just a simple communication, and I've got that picture.
然后再做这个产品，整个研发过程就非常快。
Then do this product again, the whole development process is very fast.
」数字防疫系统是钉钉联合阿里云、支付宝、达摩院、政务钉钉等团队，与各地政府合作推出的助力防疫的平台，在平台上，居民可以在线问诊，医务人员也可以在线统计发热数据和疑似病例。
The digital epidemic prevention system is a platform for force prevention launched by teams working with local governments to nail down Ali Yun, Alipay, Damoch and Political Nail Nails. On the platform, residents can seek medical treatment online and medical staff can keep track of calorific data and suspected cases online.
只是，新产品从接到任务、提出想法，到历经几轮磨合、最终上线，从来不是容易的事。
It's just that it's never easy for a new product to take on tasks, come up with ideas, go through several rounds of running and finally go live.
针对特殊时期的定制化要求，「要在非常短的时间内，去提供一些定制化的产品和实践，其实是很难的事情。
Customization at a particular time requires that "it is very difficult to provide customized products and practices in a very short period of time."
」琬鸥说。
"said Carmen.
她是大年初一晚上接到电话的，本以为初二一早只是去浙江卫健委简短地开个会，没想到在那栋建筑里呆了好几天。
She got the call on New Year's Eve, thought that the early morning of the first two days only to Zhejiang Wei Jiancommittee for a brief meeting, did not expect to stay in that building for several days.
她对那几天伙食唯一的印象，是食堂窗口的大叔「挺凶的」，这或许是因为在非常时期，连食堂的规矩都变严格了，多带一份饭也需要开证明。
Her only impression of the meals of those days was that of the uncle at the dining-room window, who was "fierce," perhaps because, in times of emergency, even the canteen rules had become more strict, and an extra meal had to be certified.
「但是饭怎么样，我其实真不太记得了。
"But how was the meal? I don't really remember.
」目前，这套数字防疫系统已经覆盖了28个省市自治区。
The system now covers 28 provinces and municipalities.
琬鸥觉得和卫健委的客户们滋生了一种感情，他们之间原本的距离感和界限感，在经过了密集地朝夕相处后，变成了一种战友的感觉，「我们好像真的是朋友一样。
Carmen Flock feels like he is a real friend to his clients, and the sense of distance and boundary between them has become a kind of comrade-in-arms, after intense years together.
」她觉得这是一场战斗，而自己也在一线作战。
She felt that it was a battle, and that she was fighting on the front line.
琬鸥 图源受访者2同样是年初三中午，12点，河南省南阳市淅川县的高三学生小立刚刚吃完午饭。
Carmen Gull II was also at noon on the 3rd day of the year, and at 12 o'clock, junior high school students in Xichuan County, Nanyang City, Henan Province, had just finished lunch.
这是他一天里为数不多的空闲时候。
It was one of the few idle hours in his day.
他接到了一个电话。
He got a call.
和大多数高三生一样，这是辛苦的一年，早上6点起，晚上10点睡，小立是想通过读书改变命运的芸芸学子中的一位。
Like most high school seniors, it was a hard year, starting at 6 am and sleeping at 10 pm. Xiao Li was one of the students who wanted to change their fate through reading.
自各省陆续将重大突发公共卫生事件级别调整到一级开始，在家上课就成了学子们的一种刚需。
Since the provinces have adjusted the level of major public health emergencies to the first level, home schooling has become a new need for students.
尤其是即将面临高考的高三生，最后几个月的冲刺，往往是直接决定命运的事。
In particular, the upcoming college entrance examination of the third year of high school students, the last few months of the sprint, is often directly determined by fate.
小立的成绩在学校里排名前三，他的目标学校是浙江大学。
Xiao Li's grades are in the top three in the school, his target school is Zhejiang University.
可是疫情下的学习却需要硬件的支持，本就处于高考大省，竞争激烈，如今他似乎打开了更为艰难的模式，他的家里没有网，流量又贵，他跟邻居打了招呼，借用隔壁的网络听课。
Now he seems to have opened up a more difficult model. His home has no net and the traffic is expensive. He says hello to his neighbors and borrows lessons from the internet next door.
信号不好的时候，他得爬到天台蹭网。
He had to crawl to the roof when the signal was bad.
在初春的中原地区，一个寂静的身影爬到天台上，只为了完成求学梦想。
In the early spring of the Central Plains, a silent figure climbed to the roof, only to complete the dream of learning.
电话是钉钉一位小二打来的，他一直对河南省格外关注。
The phone was nailed by a penis who had been paying special attention to Henan province.
在河南，全省有14个贫困县，「如果没有疫情，估计这会儿应该可以脱帽子了。
In Henan Province, there are 14 poor counties, "if there is no epidemic, it should be possible to take off the hat now.
」他让联通的合作伙伴帮忙重点留意一下这14个县，听网课的孩子们可能会遇到什么困难？硬件是否过关？Wi-Fi和宽带是否够用？要不要布网线？会不会家里连手机也没有？只是，像小立家这样的情况，是无法靠线上解决的。
"He asked Unicom's partners to help focus on the 14 counties, what difficulties might the children encounter? Will the hardware be adequate? Will Wi-Fi and broadband be sufficient? Will there be no cellphones at home?
电话的那一头，小立「很轻描淡写地在讲（困难）」，电话这一头，「这是个怎样的孩子？这是种怎样的场景？」这位钉钉小二还在琢磨。
At the other end of the line, Xiao Li "spoke lightly of (difficulties)," on the other end of the line, "What kind of a child is this? What kind of a scenario is this?" The nailed penis is still pondering.
挂了电话后，他立刻联系了负责推进淅川县基础设施建设的中国联通的李杨。
After hanging up, he immediately contacted Unicom's Li Yang, who is responsible for promoting infrastructure construction in the city.
两人合计了一下，李杨很快就出发去男孩家。
Together, Li Yang set off for the boy's house soon.
那是一个用于陪读的出租房，平房、开间。
It was a rented room for reading, bungalow, and open room.
房间里最多的东西是书本，进门就是简易的炉灶，课桌是教室里常见的窄窄的书桌，表面有剥落的痕迹，上方挂着全家人的洗干净的衣服。
The most common items in the room were books, simple stoves when entering the house, desks that were narrow and common in the classroom, with flaking marks on the surface and laundry hanging over them.
男孩的父母都在超市打工，尽管收入不高，但总不算是当地最困难的人家。
Both the boys' parents worked in the supermarket and, although their incomes were low, they were not the most needy families in the area.
「后来，我就回到了我自己最初的那个假设，会不会有些人，（家里的）硬件可能是不具备的？这个事儿倒也不是说穷（到什么地步），而是说，在这个阶段，我们现在的数字化其实还是有很多关需要突破的，很多思维方式需要去打破。
"Later, I went back to my original assumption that there might be people whose hardware might not be available, but rather that at this stage, we still have a lot of digitalization to break through and many ways of thinking need to be broken.
」钉钉小二说。
"said Little Nail.
考虑到要把无法返校的损失压到最小，钉钉团队从年初三起先给河南和云南的学校布置了硬件基础设施，比如用于直播的网线和支架。
To minimize the cost of not being able to go back to school, the nail-nailing team initially put in place hardware infrastructure, such as wire and scaffolding for live broadcasts, for schools in Henan and Yunnan from the beginning of the year.
无法复课的时候，这些硬件就是老师们线上教学的保障。
When unable to resume classes, these hardware is the teachers on-line teaching guarantee.
至少，也要保证老师能够找到学生，学生能够找到老师。
At the very least, make sure that teachers find students and students find teachers.
疫情导致的不得已而为之的线上教学，或许可以成为转变的契机。
Online education, a last resort due to the epidemic, could be an opportunity for change.
通过网线和屏幕，身在山区的孩子们也可以看到大城市优秀教师的直播课。
Children in the mountains can also see live lessons from good teachers in big cities via wire and screen.
一些固有的差异与隔膜，可以借此被逐步打破。
Some of the inherent differences with the membrane can be broken down step by step.
小立家的内景 图源受访者3清晨六七点，多数人醒来之前，是钉钉员工们最忙碌的时候。
Most people wake up at six or seven in the morning. It's the busiest time to nail down employees.
对整个技术团队来说，上午最紧张。
The morning was the most hectic for the entire technical team.
8点、9点、10点，分别是流量最高的三个整点。
8: 00, 9: 00, 10: 00, respectively, is the highest flow of the three punctuation points.
公司开早会，学生们上网课，通常都是从这几个节点出发，形成长达几个小时的流量高峰期，直到中午12点才攀过峰值。
The company holds morning meetings, and students usually take classes online from these nodes, forming peak traffic of up to a few hours until 12 noon.
这是一场对技术和服务器的考试。
This is a test on technology and servers.
钉钉CTO一粟打了个比方来形容这场「考试」的难度：早上8、9点的高峰期对于钉钉来说，像是要在一个小时内承受用户收看几十场世界杯决赛的压力。
The nailing of CTO millet is a metaphor for the difficulty of the "exam": the peak at 8 or 9 in the morning is like being under pressure to watch dozens of World Cup finals in an hour.
团队要做的，是赶在8点之前，预判出可能的流量值，并利用阿里云服务器，保证在大量用户同时涌入时，软件不会崩、不会卡。
What the team is going to do is pre-determine the likely traffic by 8: 00 and use the Ariane Cloud server to ensure that the software doesn't crash or get stuck when large numbers of users arrive at the same time.
——这相当于是考试前的复习和猜题。
This is the equivalent of reviewing and guessing the questions before the exam.
3日扩容1万台，4日，再扩容1万台，到12日，钉钉通过阿里云连续扩容10万台云服务器。
On the 3rd day, the capacity was increased by 10,000 units, and on the fourth day it was expanded by another 10,000 units.
杨旭是阿里云扩充服务器的技术负责人。
Yang Xu is the technical director of the Ali cloud expansion server.
他称阿里云对于钉钉扩容的支持，可以类比盖火神山医院：通常而言盖一座房子，可能会需要三四个月的时间，先要打地基，之后造骨架，还要铺水泥。
He says Aliyun's support for nail-to-nail expansion can be likened to Mount Guifei: normally it takes three to four months to build a house, first to lay the foundation, then to build the skeleton, and then to lay the concrete.
但在非常时期，工期被压缩了。
But during the hard times, the schedule was compressed.
杨旭记得有一天夜里，一批服务器要从十几摄氏度的深圳，发往下着大雪的张北。
Yang Xu remembered that one night, a number of servers from a dozen degrees Celsius of Shenzhen, sent to the snowy north of Zhang.
巨大的服务器连夜坐着专用的大卡车，每经过一个关卡，都需要做一次消毒。
Huge servers sit in dedicated trucks overnight, each passing through a checkpoint that needs to be disinfected.
他所在的工作群里，正在直播。
He's in a working group. He's live.
所有人都很关心，现在卡车到哪里了？大概还要多久才能抵达？阿里云扩充服务器在运输过程中图源受访者直播进行了4个小时，凌晨，这批服务器在张北就位。
Everybody is concerned. Where is the truck now? How long will it take to get there? The server was broadcast live by the source during the transportation process for four hours, and the servers were in place in the early hours of the morning.
边工作边盯着直播的人们放心了。
People watching the live broadcast at work are relieved.
此时，距离早高峰只剩几个小时，后方的技术人员们必须抓紧扩容。
At this point, only a few hours before the early peak, the technical staff in the rear must speed up the expansion.
就像一场接力马拉松。
It's like a relay marathon.
没有人敢耽误进度，人人都想着如何跑得更快一点，给下一棒留出多一些的时间。
No one dares to delay progress, and everyone wants to think about how to run faster and give more time for the next one.
他们已经在最短的时间内获取了资源并调配到位，接下来，他们要「盖房子」了。
They've got the resources and resources in place in the shortest possible time, and then they're going to "build a house."
这座建在云上的房子，是用类似3D打印的方法盖成的。
Built on a cloud, the house is built in a way similar to 3D printing.
快速建模，自动化流程，标准化交付。
Fast Modeling, Automation Process, Standardized Delivery.
「类似于样板间。
"Similar to a sample room.
」他形容。
"he said.
8点大考开始后，基本可以确定哪些地方要降级，哪些地方要扩容。
After the 8 o'clock test starts, you can basically determine which places should be downgraded and which places should be expanded.
这意味着考试通过，悬了一天的心可以暂且放一放了。
This means passing the exam and letting your heart hang for a day.
每天都是一个小循环，每周是一个大循环——下周一早上8点，又要迎来新的考试。
Every day is a small cycle. Every week is a big cycle. Next Monday at 8: 00 am, another exam is coming.
早上值班的时候，一粟的桌上总是堆满了屏幕：两块台式机的显示屏，一个笔记本电脑，一个平板电脑，三台手机。
On duty in the morning, a tiny table is always filled with screens: two desktop screens, a laptop, a tablet computer, and three cell phones.
设备们各司其职——平板电脑负责看水位图，两部手机连着不同的视频会议，另一部则用于接听电话，电脑分别开着不同的作战群聊。
The devices do their job - the tablet looks at the level map, the two phones have different videoconferences, the other is used to answer the phone, and the computers talk in different battle groups.
与陡然出现的流量曲线类似，团队人员的工作负荷，也在短短几天内陡然上升。
Like the abrupt appearance of the flow curve, the team's workload also jumped in a matter of days.
「我们有时候晚上开晚会的时候，开着开着，会听到打呼的声音，有些同学在自己书桌边上趴着，就睡着了，就打呼了，还不止一两次。
"Sometimes when we have a party in the evening and it's open, we hear the sound of whimpering. Some students are lying on their desks and falling asleep, snoring more than once or twice.
」一粟说，听起来并没有在批评的意思。
"It doesn't sound like criticism," he said.
因为无法线下复工，钉钉团队内部的人也只能通过视频会议来沟通工作。
Since it was not possible to resume work offline, people within the nail team could only communicate via videoconference.
琬鸥还记得，在她第一次踏入浙江省卫健委指挥室时，大屏幕上是正在召开的视频会议。
Carmen also remembers that when she first stepped into Zhejiang Bodyguard's command room, there was a video conference on the big screen.
她觉得新鲜，且不好意思，「之前我们用的都不多，客户用的比我们用得好」。
She felt new and embarrassed. "We didn't use much before and our customers used better than we did."
最开始，通过视频聊工作是一件略显奇怪的事。
At first, it was a bit strange to work with a video chat.
视频电话接通的一刹那，屏幕上会出现同事们的脸，有的没梳洗，有的还穿着睡衣。
The moment a video phone is switched on, the faces of colleagues appear on the screen, some unwashed and some in pajamas.
很多人的第一反应是关掉摄像头。
Many people's first reaction is to turn off the camera.
一粟注意到了这个问题。
A drop in the bucket noticed the problem.
后来，他们上线了美颜的功能，后来愿意打开摄像头的人明显增多了。
Later, they went online with beauty features, and there was a noticeable increase in the number of people willing to turn on the camera.
讲到这里，一粟忍不住想笑。
At this point, a millet can't help but laugh.
后来，大家逐渐形成了默契。
Later, we gradually formed a tacit understanding.
在视频会议开始前，他们会换上平常工作的衣服——这是一种仪式感，然后清空自己的背景，试图在各式各样的环境里，打造一张安静的工位。
Before the videoconference began, they would change into their usual work clothes -- a sense of ceremony, then empty their backgrounds, trying to create a quiet job in a variety of environments.
不过，偶尔还是有一些特殊情况。
Occasionally, however, there are special circumstances.
很多人在视频会议室里看到了同事家的孩子在撒娇，父母在喊吃饭，还有琬鸥5岁的萨摩耶。
Many see children playing the game in video conference rooms, and Carmen, 5, of Carmen or Carmen, are calling for dinner.
有一个同事被困在老家，每天7点半晨会的时候，家里养的公鸡会准时打鸣。
There is a colleague trapped in his hometown, every morning at 7: 30 in the morning meeting, the rooster in the home will be punctual.
2亿用户，5000万名学生，1000万家企业。
There are 200 million users, 50 million students and 10 million businesses.
这是2月25日，钉钉5.0新品见面会上，CEO陈航提到的数字。
This is February 25, nailing 5. 0 new product meet-up meeting, CEO Chen Hang referred to the figures.
当庞大的人群聚集于云上，每个人都能通过平台，推动更多、成就更多。
When huge crowds gather on the clouds, everyone can push more and achieve more through the platform.
如果很多年后，要回忆起这反复交叠的一天又一天，日子变得厚重的一个多月，一粟想，他最会记得的，还是每天清晨，钉钉和阿里云的两个团队会同时拉他进视频会议里，开始一天的「早值班」检查工作。
If, many years later, he remembered the day after day, the day had become so thick, what he would remember best was that every morning, the two teams, nailing and Ali Yun, would pull him in for a day of "morning duty" inspections.
在内部团队，「早值班」是由来已久的传统，每天值班的人就像巡逻的哨警，早早地检查可能存在的问题。
In-house, the "morning shift" is a long-standing tradition, with people on duty every day acting as a patrol guard, checking for possible problems early.
这个跨越了距离的会议室和往常一样吵吵嚷嚷，在屏幕那头看不到的地方，7点半时，总有鸡鸣响起。
The far-flung boardroom was noisy as usual, out of sight at the end of the screen, and at half past seven, the chickens were ringing.
