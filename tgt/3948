2020年本可以成为国际体坛“最好的时代”。
The year 2020 could have been the "best of times" for international sports.
但随着新冠疫情在全球肆虐，国际体坛或将迎来“最坏的时代”。
But with the new crown wreaking havoc across the globe, the international sports world may be headed for the "worst."
近日，NBA、F1、欧洲杯、欧洲足坛五大联赛纷纷按下“暂停键”，全球瞩目的2020年东京奥运会或将面临“难产”。
The world's most watched games in Tokyo in 2020 could face a "difficult labor" as the NBA, F1, Euro and European football leagues press the "pause" button.
无论取消抑或延期，这些国际赛事都将承受巨额损失：欧洲杯或损失数十亿欧元；NBA本赛季剩下250多场比赛，光是门票收入损失就超4亿美元；而奥运会的损失更是“难以估量”。
Cancelled or postponed, these international tournaments will suffer huge losses: Euros or billions of euros; the NBA will have more than 250 games left this season, with ticket revenue losses alone exceeding $400 million; and Olympic losses are "incalculable."
此前有统计显示，全球体育产业市场规模在2018年达到4885亿美元，预计将于2022年达到6141亿美元。
According to previous statistics, the global sports market reached $488.5 billion in 2018 and is expected to reach $614.1 billion in 2022.
“对全球体育产业来说，疫情以及引发的股灾，百年一遇的大停摆，线下经营场景的崩溃，打击是非常致命的。
"For the global sports industry, the epidemic and the resulting stock market disaster, the once-in-a-century shutdown, the collapse of the offline business scene, the blow is very lethal."
体育联盟与联赛方面，被影响到的球员薪资、球队破产潮、球队转会预算削减潮，都会在未来数年里影响到体育世界的版图。
In sports leagues and leagues, affected salaries, a wave of bankruptcies and budget cuts will affect the world of sports for years to come.
”体育界资深人士向记者表示。
Senior sports figures told reporters.
3月13日，世界卫生组织（WHO）正式将不断蔓延的新冠肺炎疫情定性为“全球大流行”（Pandemic），如同给全球体育下了“最后通牒”。
On March 13, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially characterized the spreading outbreak of new crown pneumonia as a "global pandemic," giving global sports an "ultimatum."
此轮全球赛事“停摆风波”将何去何从？近日，记者多方采访国际奥委会、欧足联、世卫组织等国际权威机构及国内外体育界资深人士，对当前形势进行了分析。
In recent days, journalists from the International Olympic Committee, UEFA, WHO and other international authorities, as well as senior sports figures from home and abroad, have conducted an analysis of the current situation.
欧洲杯：或损失数十亿欧元“保障球迷、球员和相关人员的健康是我们的第一要务。
European Cup: or the loss of billions of euros "Safeguarding the health of fans, players and associates is our number one priority.
作为欧洲足球主管部门，我们主导了这一切的进程，做出了巨大的牺牲。
As the head of European football, we led the way and made great sacrifices.
”欧足联（UEFA）向记者表示。
UEFA told reporters.
3月17日，欧足联正式宣布将2020欧洲杯延期至2021年6月11日至7月11日举行。
On 17 March, UEFA officially announced an extension of Euro 2020 to be held from 11 June to 11 July 2021.
对于欧足联和欧洲足球而言，延期的代价无疑是巨大的。
For UEFA and European football, the cost of the delay is unquestionably enormous.
据福布斯报道，欧足联计划在2020年欧洲杯上获得25亿欧元的收入，预计利润将超过10亿欧元。
According to Forbes, UEFA plans to raise €2.5 billion in revenues at Euro 2020, with a projected profit of more than €1 billion.
记者了解到，为纪念欧洲杯60年，本届赛事原计划采取无主办国的巡回赛方式在欧洲11个国家12座城市举行。
Reporters learned that to commemorate the European Cup 60 years, the event was originally planned to take the non-host country tour of 12 cities in 11 countries in Europe.
欧洲杯赛事对于举办城市有着显著刺激经济作用：一座球场举办四场比赛，预计能为当地带来超过1亿欧元收入。
The EURO Cup has had a significant economic impact on the host city: a stadium holding four matches is expected to generate more than 100 million euros in local revenues.
上周末，欧洲足球五大联赛（意甲、法甲、西甲、英超和德甲）以及欧战赛事早于欧洲杯全部停摆。
The top five European leagues (Serie A, France, Spain, Premiership and Bundesliga) and the European Championship were suspended before Euro 2008 last weekend.
至此，欧洲足坛纷纷“偃旗息鼓”。
So far, the European football world has been "Yanqi."
据各国媒体粗略估算，综合转播、赞助、门票来看，如果联赛就此结束，英超会损失约8.25亿欧元，西甲、德甲、意甲都差不多会损失7亿欧元。
According to rough estimates by national media, the league will lose around 825 million euros if the league ends, with Spain, Germany and Serie A losing almost 700 million euros.
据《每日邮报》报道，如果7月底前没有完成比赛，英超将面临赔付近33亿欧元电视转播合同违约金风险。
If the game is not completed by the end of July, the Premiership faces the risk of paying nearly 3.3 billion euros in television contract violations, the Daily Mail reported.
英国顶尖体育数据公司Sportcal赛事主管克里斯托弗告诉记者：“疫情持续恶化，除影响短期赛事收入外，更重要的是影响欧洲经济，从而对欧洲体育市场造成长期深层次影响。
Christopher Christopher, head of sports at Britain's leading sports data company, told reporters: "The epidemic is worsening, affecting not only short-term revenues but also, and more importantly, the European economy, with a profound long-term impact on the European sports market.
目前还无法准确预估疫情恶化造成的损失，但起码有数十亿欧元。
It is not yet possible to predict accurately the damage caused by the worsening epidemic, but there are at least billions of euros.
”值得注意的是，欧洲杯延期将导致一系列连锁反应，原定于2021年夏天在中国举行的2021年世俱杯也将面临延期风险。
Notably, the European Cup extension will set off a chain reaction, with the 2021 World Cup, originally scheduled to be held in China in the summer of 2021, also at risk of being postponed.
而改革后的世俱杯是国际足联（FIFA）努力打造的“吸金”平台，接下来国际足联与欧足联势必还有一番角力。
The reformed FIFA World Cup is the "suction" platform that FIFA is trying to create, and FIFA and UEFA will have to contend with each other.
NBA：每场比赛损失超百万美元事实上，作为世界上最成熟的商业体育联盟之一，NBA很早就觉察到新冠疫情的威胁。
NBA Losses Over $Million In fact, as one of the world's most mature commercial sports leagues, the NBA has long been aware of the threat of a new crown.
但其背后庞大的商业利益如同“巨手”一般，影响着NBA的最终抉择。
But the big commercial interests behind it are like "giant hands," influencing the NBA's final decision.
疫情很早就在美国迅速扩散。
The epidemic spread rapidly in the United States long ago.
3月7日，NBA才首次提到“空场比赛”和“停摆”可能性。
Only on March 7 did the NBA first mention the possibility of an "empty field game" and a "standstill".
3月11日，旧金山市政府呼吁勇士队鉴于疫情蔓延取消比赛，然而勇士并没有听取建议。
On March 11, San Francisco's city government called on the Warriors to cancel the game in view of the spread of the outbreak.
直到近日，犹他爵士队明星中锋戈贝尔被确诊为新冠肺炎病例后，NBA才最终被迫作出停赛决定。
It wasn't until recently that the NBA was forced to make a decision to suspend Utah star center Robert Goebbels after he was diagnosed with pneumonia.
有外媒如此评价戈贝尔：“作为联盟最佳防守球员的他，以一己之力防住了联盟。
"As the best defensive player in the league, he was able to defend the league on his own," Goebbels said.
” 目前，加上刚被确诊的篮网队球星凯文·杜兰特，NBA已有7人感染新冠病毒。
Now, with newly diagnosed Nets star Kevin Durant, the NBA has seven new infections.

据《福布斯》公布的数据，NBA在2018-19赛季总收入达88亿美元，同比增长10%，其中门票收入达19.4亿美元。
The NBA earned $8.8 billion in 2018-19, up 10% from a year earlier, with ticket sales at $1.94 billion, according to Forbes.
停摆最直接影响的就是门票收入。
The immediate effect of the stoppage is ticket revenue.
粗略推算，联盟30支球队的平均门票收入为6467万美元，平均到41个主场比赛，每场球是158万美元，这些钱足以铺满斯台普斯的地板。
By rough calculation, the average ticket income of the league's 30 teams was $64.67 million, averaging 41 home games for $1.58 million a game, enough to cover the Staples floor.
而从球员角度来看，以勒布朗·詹姆斯为例，洛杉矶湖人队每少打一场比赛，这位NBA顶级球星就会损失约40万美元。
From a players point of view, LeBron James, for example, loses about $400,000 for every game the Los Angeles Lakers play.
腾讯体育表示，门票损失加电视转播和球衣赞助方面的损失，NBA暂停剩余赛季比赛，最终损失金额极有可能超过10亿美元。
Tencent said the loss of tickets plus losses on TV and shirt sponsorship could well exceed $1 billion as the NBA suspends the rest of the season.
一直以来，电视转播收入支撑起NBA收入的“半壁江山”。
Broadcast revenue has been supporting half of NBA revenues.
停摆意味着失去电视转播合同收入，给NBA带来巨大的财政风险。
A stoppage would mean losing revenue from television broadcasting contracts, posing a huge financial risk to the NBA.
比如，2014年底，ESPN、TNT就和NBA达成从2016-2017赛季开始持续9年高达240亿美元的“天价”转播合同，年均近26.7亿美元。
At the end of 2014, for example, ESPN, TNT, and the NBA agreed to a $24 billion "sky-high" contract for nine years, starting with the 2016-2017 season, averaging nearly $2.67 billion a year.
此外，腾讯体育是国内唯一获NBA官方授权的转播机构。
In addition, Tencent Sports is the only domestic broadcaster to be officially authorized by the NBA.
腾讯刚与NBA续约至2025年夏天，合同金额约为5年15亿美元左右。
Tencent has just extended its NBA contract to the summer of 2025 for about $1.5 billion over five years.
目前，关于新冠疫情是否属于不可抗力因素范畴以及NBA联盟被合同各方追责之可能尚无定论。
At present, whether the new crown is a force majeure factor and the NBA league by the parties to the contract may not be conclusive.
美国资深体育人约翰·霍林格认为：“除开门票，球队周边商品，NBA球队经营的餐饮等业务也将受到影响，各队整体收入会大幅下滑。
John Hollinger, a veteran U.S. sportsman, said: "In addition to opening tickets, the merchandise surrounding the team, the catering operations of NBA teams will be affected and the overall revenues of the teams will decline dramatically.
一旦完全停摆，NBA球队连转播收入这最后一根救命稻草都会失去。
Once the game is over, NBA teams will lose even the last straw in transmitting their revenue.
”氪体创始人骆达告诉记者：“经济损失是一道数学题。
Kryptonian founder Gary Locke told reporters: "Economic losses are a mathematical problem.
然而球员健康和后续恢复则是两个问答题。
But player health and follow-up are two questions.
疫情是否会影响球员职业生涯？NBA恢复到全盛需要多久？这些问题同样揪心。
Whether the epidemic will affect a player's career? How long will it take for the NBA to recover to its full strength?
”从各方报道来看，NBA和球队仍没有打算就此放弃本赛季。
According to reports, the NBA and the team are still not ready to give up the season.
据ESPN消息，目前联赛最可能的恢复时间是6月中下旬。
According to ESPN, the most likely recovery time for the league is in mid-to-late June.
也有专家指出，不排除之后直接开始季后赛可能。
Experts also pointed out that not excluding the possibility of a direct postseason after the start.
东京奥运会：日本经济“救命稻草”目前，东京奥运会本土赞助收入就超过33亿美元，几乎是北京奥运会三倍左右，也远超近两届FIFA世界杯赞助金额，打破了历届奥运会赞助纪录。
TOKYO (Reuters) - Home-grown sponsorship revenue for the Tokyo Olympics now exceeds $3.3 billion, nearly three times that of the Beijing Games and well above the previous two FIFA World Cup sponsorships, breaking all previous Olympic sponsorship records.
但是，全球新冠肺炎的严峻形势，令东京奥运会前景“阴云密布”。
However, the severe situation of the world's new crown pneumonia, the prospect of the Tokyo Olympic Games "cloudy."
3月17日晚间，日本首相安倍晋三再次强调奥运会和残奥会将如期完整举行。
On the evening of March 17, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe again stressed that the Olympic and Paralympic Games would be held as scheduled.
然而，日本上周一项民调显示，45%的受访者反对奥运会如期举行。
However, a Japanese poll last week showed that 45 percent of respondents opposed holding the games as scheduled.
日前，东京奥组委理事高桥治之提出延期至2022年举行，届时夏季奥运会和冬季奥运会同年举办，2022年将成为引人注目的“奥运年”。
Takahashi, TOKYO's governing board, has postponed the Games until 2022, the year in which the Summer and Winter Games are held and 2022 will be the highlight of the Games.
据了解，已有多名奥组委理事表示同意。
It is understood that a number of BOCOG directors have agreed.
而东京奥组委理事会也计划于30日召开会议讨论该问题。
The Tokyo Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games Council is also scheduled to meet on the 30th to discuss the issue.
骆达向记者表示：奥运延期举行，或将导致奥运聚集效应不再，4000万人次的旅游观光消费化作乌有，或大打折扣。
The postponement of the Olympics may cause the Olympics to have no more aggregate effect, Locke told reporters, with 40 million tourist trips being turned into Ukraine or discounted.
同时还可能和其他国际比赛赛程发生冲突。
It could also clash with other international tournaments.
截自东京奥运会官网诚然，东京奥运会的一举一动，都影响着日本的经济与国民信心。
Indeed, every move at the Tokyo Olympics has affected Japan's economy and national confidence.
面对外界对于新冠疫情的担忧，日本政府多次坚称奥运会将如期举办。
Faced with concerns about the new crown, the Japanese government has repeatedly insisted that the Games will be held as scheduled.
“日本经济处于一个衰退边缘，奥运会无疑是一个强有力的刺激。
"The Japanese economy is on the brink of a recession, and the Olympics are certainly a powerful stimulus.
取消奥运会将对日本经济、社会产生全方位的影响。
The cancellation of the Olympic Games will have an all-round impact on Japan's economy and society.
对运动员、相关国际体育组织以及奥林匹克这项运动的影响更加深远。
The impact on athletes, relevant international sports organizations and the Olympic movement has been even more profound.
”克里斯托弗向记者表示。
Christopher told reporters.
自2013年申奥成功后，日本花了7年时间筹备奥运会，有关2020东京奥运会的重大投资项目，逐一上马。
Since its successful bid in 2013, Japan has spent seven years preparing for the Games, launching major investment projects for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games.
目前已至少投入262亿美元，用于场馆建设、配套设施升级等。
At least $26.2 billion has been invested in the construction of venues and the upgrading of ancillary facilities.
奥运会一旦取消或延期，后期运营可能无法获得与预期相符的资金回流速度，加上运营成本高企，许多场馆有可能变成“负资产”，当地政府将欠下银行的高额贷款本息。
If the Olympics are canceled or postponed, late-stage operations may not be able to get as much money back as expected. Coupled with high operating costs, many venues could become "negative assets," with local governments defaulting on banks "high loan-service obligations.
某种程度上，奥运会被视作日本经济的“救命稻草”。
To some extent, the Olympics are seen as a "lifeline" for Japan's economy.
安倍晋三曾称：“要让奥运会成为扫除15年通货紧缩和经济衰退的触发器。
"For the Olympics to become a trigger for 15 years of deflation and economic decline," Abe has said.
”据东京都政府估算，从申办成功的2013年至奥运会举办10年后的2030年，日本全国总计经济效益将达32万亿日元左右（约3000亿美元）。
The Tokyo metropolitan government estimates that the country's total economic benefits from the successful bid for 2013 to 2030, 10 years after the Games, will be about Y32 trillion ($300 billion).
不过，东京奥运会取消或推迟与否，其最终决定权还在国际奥委会（IOC）手里。
However, the final decision on whether to cancel or postpone the Games rests with the International Olympic Committee.
国际奥委会告诉记者：“距离奥运会开幕还有19周左右的时间，我们对于成功如期举办东京奥运会的立场没有改变。
"With about 19 weeks to go before the start of the Games, our position on the successful hosting of the Tokyo Olympics has not changed," the IOC told reporters.
我们与世卫、东京奥组委、日本政府保持着密切沟通。
We are in close communication with WHO, TOKYO and the Japanese government.
我们将继续遵循世卫组织关于疫情防控的建议。
We will continue to follow the WHO recommendations on disease prevention and control.
”国际奥委会表示：“当下重要任务之一是解决东京奥运会资格赛配额等问题。
"One of the important tasks ahead is to resolve the issue of quotas for the qualifying round of the Tokyo Olympic Games," the IOC said.
我们将和各国际体育单项组织沟通，灵活应对解决这一问题，使资格赛配额公开、公正、公平。
We will communicate with individual international sports organizations, flexibly address this issue, so that the qualification race quotas are open, fair and equitable.
”此前有统计显示，全球体育产业市场规模在2018年达到4885亿美元，预计将于2022年达到6141亿美元。
The global sports market, which had previously been estimated at $488.5 billion in 2018, is expected to reach $614.1 billion in 2022.
而据普华永道去年底发布的《2019体育行业调查报告》，未来3到5年全球体育市场预计增长率为6.4%。
According to the 2019 Sports Industry Survey, published by PricewaterhouseCoopers late last year, the global sports market is expected to grow by 6.4 per cent over the next three to five years.
而世卫组织向记者透露：“我们仍然处于新冠病毒全球爆发的初期。
"We are still in the early stages of a global outbreak of the new crown virus," the WHO told reporters.
在此阶段，我们无法预测本次全球性大流行病将持续多久。
At this stage, we cannot predict how long this global pandemic will last.
”这意味着，疫情对于全球体育产业的冲击还将更加持久和深远。
This means that the epidemic's impact on the global sports industry will be more lasting and far-reaching.
骆达表示：“对全球体育产业来说，疫情以及引发的股灾，百年一遇的大停摆，线下经营场景的崩溃，打击是非常致命的。
"For the global sports industry, the epidemic and the resulting stock market disasters, the once-in-a-century shutdown and the collapse of the offline business scene are very fatal," Mr Locke said.
体育联盟与联赛方面，被影响到的球员薪资、球队破产潮、球队转会预算削减潮，都会在未来数年里影响到体育世界的版图。
In sports leagues and leagues, affected salaries, a wave of bankruptcies and budget cuts will affect the world of sports for years to come.
”世卫组织实时统计数据显示，截至欧洲中部时间18日18时（北京时间19日1时），全球新冠肺炎确诊病例累计达到207860例，死亡病例8657例，已报告病例的国家和地区达166个。
