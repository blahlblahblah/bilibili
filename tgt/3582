网络上有句流传很广的话：“迈进大学校门的那一刻起，故乡便只有冬夏，再无春秋。
There is a widespread saying on the Internet: "The moment you enter the university gate, the hometown only winter and summer, no spring and autumn.
”这句曾让无数学子泪目的金句，在今年恐怕要重新改写。
The golden sentence, which had made so many students cry, would probably have to be rewritten this year.
2020年的毕业季来临之前，这届毕业生们正在家中经历着，一个漫长而略显忐忑的春天。
In the run-up to the 2020 graduation season, this class of graduates is experiencing a long and somewhat perturbed spring at home.
唉！“我还能毕业吗？”这是最近一段时间，应届毕业生周婷婷朋友圈里高频出现的一句话。
Alas! "Can I still graduate?" This is a recent period, fresh graduates Tingting Zhou high-frequency friends in the circle of a sentence.
虽然带着调侃的意味，却也是她和朋友们心中真实的担忧。
Although it is full of banter, it is also a real worry for her and her friends.
横亘在所有人眼前的第一座大山就是——毕业论文。
The first mountain that stands in front of everyone is the graduation thesis.
理工科进不了实验室，人文社科做不了田野调查，不少人都因此重新更换了论文题目。
Science and engineering can not enter the laboratory, humanities and social sciences can not do the field investigation, many people have replaced the thesis title.
上海某大学医学影像专业的大四学生满满，最初打算选择的题目是“弛豫时间检测方法问题研究”，需要花大量时间在实验室做实验；三月初，学校有一次重新申报题目的机会，她便把题目换成了“脑组织图像分割的算法研究”。
A senior major in medical imaging at a university in Shanghai was full of students, and the topic of her original plan was "A study of relaxation time detection methods," which required a lot of time for laboratory experiments.
一个“问题研究”，一个“算法研究”——差别在于前者需要理论设计和实验检验相结合，而后者只需在软件上进行算法模拟即可。
A "problem study", an "algorithm study" - the difference is that the former requires a combination of theoretical and experimental testing, while the latter requires only algorithm simulations on software.
一切都是为了保证在家隔离期间的论文进度。
It's all about keeping papers in quarantine at home.
然而当进入实操阶段，大家遇到的问题却是千奇百怪的。
However, when we enter the stage of practical exercises, we encounter a variety of problems.
有人因为用不了学校的 VPN，在家期间从知网下载的每篇文献“都是自己充钱买的”；有人因为大量参考书籍留在学校宿舍，而只能在家里靠着百度“闭门造车”；也有人过年回家时根本没带电脑，现在已经在手机备忘录里写完了论文初稿……生物医学硕士刘皓，在实验室专门负责基因实验小鼠的繁育和鉴定。
Some people leave their dorm rooms with plenty of reference books and have to rely on Baidu to build their own homes. Others return home without a computer and have completed the first draft of their thesis in a cell phone memo.
他原本计划正月初五返校，为即将出生的小鼠接生分笼；在确定无法回学校之后，为避免小鼠交叉过度繁殖，他只能被迫拜托学校动物房的老师，处死了所有实验小鼠。
He had planned to return to school on the fifth day of the first month to deliver the babies; after deciding that he would not be able to return to school, he was forced to leave the school's animal room teacher to execute all the mice.
服装设计系的陈玉茹，五月份要向学校提交成衣，无奈却请不到代工，此刻“正在家里自学裁缝”。
Clothing design department of the Chen YuRu, May to submit clothing to the school, but could not hire a substitute, now "at home self-taught tailors."
雕塑系的李康，因为常去的艺术工作室不开门，现在连必须的雕塑材料都买不到了，只能被迫重新调整整体构思。
Li Kang, a sculptor, was forced to readjust the whole idea because the art studios he frequented were closed and now unable to buy the necessary sculpture.
当然，很多问题通过及时与导师和学校沟通，都是可以解决的。
Of course, many problems can be solved by communicating with teachers and schools in a timely manner.
——前提是你的导师足够负责。
The premise is that your mentor is responsible enough.
如果遇到“佛系”一点的导师，学生便只好坐在家中哭笑不得。
If you meet a Buddhist teacher, the student will have to sit at home and laugh.
“导师一般都是学术大牛，都不太爱用社交软件，经常是QQ和微信都不回复，只能通过发邮件联系，沟通效率很低。
"Mentors are usually academic calves, are not very social software, are often QQ and micro-letter do not reply, can only through email contact, communication efficiency is very low.
”郑州某大学的彭坤就遇到了这样一位导师，惜字如金，发什么都不回复。
Peng Kun, of a university in Zhengzhou, met such a mentor who was so critical of his words that he did not reply.
有天彭坤托朋友买到了酒精湿巾，发微信给导师：“老师我给您寄两包酒精湿巾吧！”导师秒回：“这么客气啊！”毕业论文再难，至少还是一件确定的事情。
One day PU Kun-too friend bought an alcohol wipes and sent a letter to his tutor, "Let me send you two bags of alcohol wipes!" The instructor replied in a second, "You're welcome!"
更让人感到折磨的，是关于未来规划的强烈的不确定性。
Even more troubling is the intense uncertainty about future planning.
按照往年分数线，满满应该可以进入上海交大的考研复试。
According to the scores of previous years, full should be able to enter the Shanghai Jiaotong postgraduate examination.
而如今复试却一再推迟，遥遥无期，甚至就连进入复试的分数线也尚未公布。
Now the second test has been postponed time and time again, even into the second test score line has not yet been announced.
她主要担心两件事情。
Her main concern was two things.
一是怕在家待得时间太久，很多知识都不熟练甚至遗忘，影响复试成绩；二是担心复试的形式发生变化，“比如变成线上面试的话，怎么确保公正性呢？笔试又该怎么进行呢？”无独有偶，参加国家公务员考试的同学们也面临类似的窘境。
One is the fear of spending too much time at home, too much knowledge is not proficient or even forgotten, and the second is the fear of changing the format of the second interview, such as how to ensure fairness if it turns into an online interview.
湖南某高校的Jason通过国考初试后，花五千多块报了中公的面试课程，“现在总感觉都浪费了”。
After passing the national examination, Jason from Hunan University spent more than five thousand dollars on an interview with the Chinese Duke.
相比之下，反倒是那些下定决心“考研二战”的同学，在这段时间拥有了更平稳的心态。
By contrast, those determined to "test for World War II" students, in this time has a smoother mentality.
“趁着这段时间在家，正好可以踏踏实实地开始复习，每天作息都很规律，生活也被爸妈照料得很好，效率挺高的。
"During this time at home, just in time to start solid review, daily work and rest are very regular, life is well cared for by parents, very efficient.
”出国党们面临的不确定性更大。
The party faces greater uncertainty.
忐忑等待offer的过程中，自己的论文、签证和语言成绩，老家所在地的疫情控制，目标国家的疫情发展程度和政策，目标院校的招生政策……所有这些都成为影响自己学业进程的因素。
The process of waiting for an offer, one's own papers, visa, and language scores, the control of the epidemic in the country of origin, the level of development and policies of the target country, and the admissions policies of the targeted institutions... all of these become factors that influence their academic progress.
有人接受了条件录取，本打算利用上半年再冲刺一下语言成绩，未曾想上半年几乎所有的语言考试都被突然取消；也有人接到 offer 后提前在纽约租好了房子，现在人在国内，房子一天没住，就已经要准备交第二轮的租金了。
Some people accepted the offer, planned to use the first half of the year to sprint at language scores, did not think of the first half of almost all language tests were suddenly cancelled; others received offers and rent their houses in New York ahead of time, and now in China, without a house for a day, they are ready to pay the second round rent.
“二月份的时候，想着我们疫情控制住之后，自然就恢复正常了，所以也没太担心。
"In February, thinking that we were under control, we naturally recovered, so we weren't too worried," he said.
但现在疫情开始全球蔓延，国外的高校也都纷纷停课了，我就觉得真的很难开学了……”诚然，很多问题是无解的，毕竟眼下最重要的事情是控制住疫情，大多数同学也都逐渐放平了心态。
But now that the epidemic is beginning to spread around the world and colleges and universities abroad are closing, I find it really hard to get to school... "Admittedly, many problems are insoluble, after all the most important thing is to control the epidemic, and most students are gradually calming down.
“焦虑和担心都没用，都不能解决问题。
Anxiety and worry are useless and neither will solve the problem.
”本打算秋季赴美读研的周婷婷说，“我觉得现在我们能做的就是少一点抱怨，别总是传递负能量，毕竟这件事是所有人在一起面对。
'I think all we can do now is complain less, don't always deliver negative energy, because it's all in the same place, 'says Zhou Tingting, who was planning to go to the U.S. in the fall.
每个人能把自己的事情管好、做好，就是胜利。
Every man can do his own thing well and do it well.
”与此同时，正在海外读书的毕业生们，心态也逐渐发生着变化。
Meanwhile, the mindset of graduates studying abroad is gradually changing.
——从最初的“担心国内的家人”，到“担心自己所在国家的疫情”，再到现在的“担心可能真的要延毕了”。
From "worrying about your family at home," to "worrying about the epidemic in your own country," to now, "fears may actually be over."
邮箱里，陆续收到了各自学校发来的“停课通知”。
In the mailbox, received from their respective schools in succession "suspension notice."
留学生圈子里甚至有了“停课这么多，应该退学费”的段子。
There is even a section in the international student community that says "all classes are suspended and tuition should be refunded."
微信群里，身在国内的家长几乎一天一问地担心着千里之外的子女。
In the microphone group, parents at home worry about their children thousands of miles away almost every day.
“要不先休学半年，回国吧，现在国内反而是最安全的。
"Why don't you take half a year off and go back to China? It's the safest thing in the country.
”可怜天下父母心，但休学和延毕都远不止是口头说说那么简单。
The world is poor, but suspension and graduation are much more than just lip service.
重修需要缴纳的学费、书本费、考试费，在国外额外多待半年到一年的生活成本，可选航班又少、售价又高的特殊时期往返机票……每个决定背后，都是实实在在的经济损失，压在一个个家庭身上。
The cost of tuition, books, exams, extra half a year to a year abroad, a special round-trip ticket with fewer options and higher prices... Every decision is a real economic loss for families.
回国还是不回，这是个问题。
Whether to return home or not is a problem.
代尔夫特理工大学的硕士应届生张晨曦在朋友圈里说：“课是停了，但我还得做实验啊，要不然该延毕了，我哭了……”还有很多留学生表示，即便留在国外很不方便，但也不愿意回国。
"The class is over, but I have to do some experiments, or I'll cry..." said Zhang Chenxi, a M.A. student at Delft Polytechnic University.
“国内疫情好不容易有了明显好转，不想因为自己回去，而再增加新的不确定性了。
"There has been a marked improvement in the situation in the country and we don't want to add new uncertainties just because we're back."
”张晨曦独自在荷兰，每天回家给衣物消毒，三天就能用完一小瓶酒精。
Zhang, who lives alone in the Netherlands, goes home every day to disinfect her clothes and use a small bottle of spirits in three days.
“荷兰现在 120ml 的小瓶酒精就要卖2欧甚至更贵，我连酒精自由都做不到了。
"Holland now sells 120ml of spirits for two or more, and I can't even get free with alcohol.
”而在隔壁瑞典读书的梁帆，因为瑞典的酒精管制，消毒只能用异丙醇代替。
In Sweden next door to the Liang Fan, because Sweden's alcohol control, sterilization can only be replaced with isopropanol.
对于身在海外的学子而言，疫情期间最大的感受就是“无力感”。
For students abroad, the greatest feeling during the epidemic is a "sense of powerlessness."
学校的迟钝和不作为，国外同学的不以为然，所在国的消极抗疫政策……自己看在眼里，急在心里，却无能为力。
School dullness and inaction, foreign students do not take seriously, the host country's passive anti-epidemic policy... their own eyes, anxious in the heart, but powerless.
“祖国现在真的是最让人安心的地方，”正在英国留学的陈荔说到，“这边的人越 calm，我心里越害怕……算了，懒得再吐槽了。
"The motherland is now really the most reassuring place," said Chen Lai, who is studying in the UK. "The more people here, the more scared I am.
”正在找工作的同学们，也同样焦头烂额。
The same applies to students looking for a job.
春招的情况急转直下。
Spring move situation turns sharply downwards.
某艺术类院校电影系，硕士班全班目前无一人找到工作。
No one in the master's class in the film department of an art school has found a job.
“本来我们行业这两年就是寒冬，疫情一来，更不用说了。
"It's been a cold winter in our industry for the last two years, not to mention the outbreak.
”海投几十份简历得不到一次面试机会，成了家常便饭。
Getting dozens of CVs submitted by Hay without an interview has become commonplace.
更有很多公司，干脆直接取消了春招计划。
Many more companies simply canceled their Spring Festival moves.
由于无法返校，不少实习生因为“没有到岗”和“要与公司共克时艰”而领不到实习工资。
Unable to return to school, many interns were not paid their internships because of "not coming on duty" and "having to overcome difficulties with the company."
即便这样，也很少有人敢直接辞职，毕竟这些原本打算靠着实习转正的同学们，既没有实际的合同，也没签三方协议，几乎没有任何主动权。
Even so, few would have dared to resign outright, given that the students, who had intended to move on from internships, had neither actual contracts nor tripartite agreements, and had little initiative.
当然，大家心里明白，公司也不容易。
Of course, people know that the company is not easy.
招聘计划暂时搁置，裁员计划却已经启动。
Recruitment plans have been put on hold, but layoffs have been initiated.
有人秋招时被录取，还没等到去公司报到，录取自己的整个部门就因公司“组织架构调整”，被“优化”掉了。
Some people are admitted to the autumn, not waiting to report to the company, the admission of their entire department because of the "organizational restructuring" of the company, was "optimized.
在上海读书的李坤岩，从大三起就在一家金融机构实习，期盼着能在今年夏天转正。
Li Kun-yan, who studied in Shanghai, has worked as an intern at a financial institution since his junior year, hoping to get it right this summer.
巨大的工作量和长期熬夜，让他去年年底患上了急性干肠炎。
He developed acute dry colitis at the end of last year because of a huge workload and a long stay up late last year.
上个月，他突然收到 leader 的微信，表示“认真考虑之后，觉得你身体可能不太好，不适合我们这个工作”。
Last month, he received a message from Leader saying, "On second thought, I don't think you're too well for this job.
当然，各高校都在想尽办法帮助毕业生就业。
Of course, colleges and universities are doing everything they can to help graduates find jobs.
3月1日，清华大学法学院官方微信发布文章，呼吁法学院的校友们“充分发挥您的影响力，为学弟学妹们提供就业信息”。
On March 1, an official micro-letter from Tsinghua University School of Law called on alumni of the law school to "use your influence to provide employment information to younger students."
随便到各大高校和学院的微信公号翻一翻，就会发现类似这样呼吁往届校友帮助就业的文章，还有很多。
There are plenty of articles like this, which call on alumni to help find work, when you double the microphone numbers of major colleges and universities.
而北大开设了一个线上招工平台，刚一上线，就被挤爆了。
And Peking University opened an online recruitment platform, just as soon as the line was squeezed out.
这届毕业生正在经历大学以来——也许是整个人生中——最漫长的一个“假期”。
This class of graduates is going through one of the longest "vacations" of their college years, perhaps the entire life.
回归到每天的日常生活，不少人也坦言，隔离在家的这段时间，“其实也挺幸福的”。
Returning to everyday life, many people confess that the time spent in isolation at home "is actually quite happy."
想想看，这么长时间陪伴在父母身边的机会，几乎很难再有，应该好好享受这段平静的亲子时光。
Think of how hard it is to spend so much time with your parents. You should enjoy the quiet time with your children.
也终于有机会，去完成那些自己一直想做却“没时间做”的计划。
It's also a chance to complete projects that you've always wanted to do but don't have the time to do.
就像最近很流行的一句鸡汤：“你度过隔离期的方式，反映着你一生能达到的高度。
As a popular chicken soup recently said: "The way you pass the quarantine period reflects the height you can achieve in your life.
”——这篇文章本来会在上面这段收尾。
This article would have ended the paragraph above.
只不过当我们把它提前发给受访者们阅读的时候，大家都不约而同地吐槽了这句鸡汤。
But when we sent it to the interviewees in advance, everyone spat on the chicken soup.
“其实我隔离期间也没干啥……没你想得那么励志……就正常生活……”“我就把现在这段时间，当成是大学生活的暂停键吧，是让我在踏入水深火热之前，再最后认真回味一下大学。
"Actually I didn't do anything during the isolation... not as inspiring as you think... just normal life...".. "" I think of this time as a pause in college life, let me before I step into the abyss, then seriously reflect on the university.
”周婷婷甚至把文章草稿发给了妈妈。
Tingting even sent her a draft of the article.
妈妈读完，摘下老花镜，“你们年轻人啊，就是太着急。
When Mom finished reading it, she took off the old glasses. "You young people are just too anxious.
其实都会好的。
It's gonna be all right.
”最后的最后，作为一个已经脱离校园太久被社会捶打过好几轮的老学长，我出于私心，想要和大家分享一些被生活教育的感悟。
Finally, as a senior student who had been knocked out of school for too long, I wanted to share some of my life-education insights out of selfishness.
也许你会觉得很鸡汤。
Maybe you'll find it very chicken soup.
但是我相信，如果未来的某一天你在无意中又看到这篇文章，你会更明白我说的这些话。
But I believe that if one day you come across this article again, you will understand it better.
❶ 不要为自己无法改变的事情而懊悔/愤怒，怨天尤人解决不了任何问题。
Never regret / be angry about something you can't change. No complaining can solve any problem.
❷时间是自己的，并且永远是自己的。
The time taken is one's own and always one's own.
❸只要有所行动，就会比躺在床上要好。
A hero who does something is better than lying in bed.
❹ 学会与困难、遗憾和焦虑共处，是我们一生的必修课。
Together with difficulties, regrets and anxieties, the Zen Society is a required course in our life.
❺ It's all about long term.（好吧这句话其实是贝索斯说的）祝大家都有光明的未来。
A: Well, I wish you all a bright future. A: B: Yes, I did.
