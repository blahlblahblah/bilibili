距离武汉封城已有28天，全国各地物资不断涌向武汉等疫情中心城市，但仍有当地医院持续高呼“急缺物资”。
Wuhan has been closed 28 days away, materials continue to flow across the country to Wuhan and other epidemic center cities, but local hospitals continue to shout "urgent material shortage."
所有人心存疑惑：物资都去哪了？作为指定防疫募捐物资接收的机构，武汉等地红十字会数次成为了舆论质疑焦点。
Everybody doubts: Where have the supplies gone? As the designated collection of epidemic prevention material institutions, Wuhan and other places have become the focus of public opinion doubts.
就此，AI前哨站梳理了武汉市、孝感市、黄冈市三地红十字会官方公示的防疫物资捐赠和发放信息。
In this regard, AI outpost combed Wuhan, Xiaogan City, Huanggang City, the Red Cross officially announced the donation and distribution of epidemic prevention materials.
据梳理结果，武汉市红十字会存在超六成口罩未发放或发放未公布（以下简称“发放情况不明”），物资发放流向不明、公示数量不清、计量单位极为混乱等情况。
According to the results, Wuhan Red Cross Society in the existence of more than 60% of masks have not been issued or issued unpublished (hereinafter referred to as "distribution status unknown"), the flow of supplies unknown, the number of publicity, extremely chaotic units of measurement.
多地捐赠物资发放比率低，武汉红会超六成口罩发放情况不明截至17日24时，武汉市、孝感市、黄冈市是确诊新冠肺炎病例最多的三个城市，AI前哨站选取这三个城市的红十字会作为梳理对象，查询了截止至2月14日18时，三地红十字会官方公示的防疫物资捐赠和发放信息。
As of 2400 hours on February 17, Wuhan city, Xiaogan City and Huanggang City were the three cities with the highest number of confirmed cases of New Crown Pneumonia. AI outpost selected the Red Cross Society of the three cities as the target, and inquired about the donation and distribution of epidemic prevention materials officially announced by the Red Cross Society of the three places.
每日红十字会物资捐赠和发放情况。
Daily Red Cross material donations and distribution.
数据显示，在“口罩”这一分类类目中的物资，武汉红十字会收到高达1000万只口罩，但仍有超六成口罩发放情况不明，仅发放了38.6%。
The Wuhan Red Cross has received up to 10 million masks under the mask category, but the distribution of more than 60 percent is unknown, with only 38.6 percent distributed, according to the data.
而黄冈、孝感的口罩发放比例相对较高，分别是63.6%、64.98%。
But Huanggang, filial piety of the proportion of the distribution of relatively high, respectively 63.6%, 64.98%.
除了物资发放后未公布的情况，武汉红十字会也存在着部分物资积压，尚未发放现象。
In addition to the distribution of materials after the situation has not been published, Wuhan Red Cross also has a partial material backlog, not yet issued.
此前，武汉市常务副市长胡亚波接收媒体采访时称，堆积在临时仓库的物资有相当一部分是不符合医用标准的。
Earlier, Wuhan Deputy Mayor Hu Yapo told the media that a considerable amount of the materials piled up in temporary warehouses are not up to medical standards.
但数据显示，在医院防疫急缺的“N95及以上级别口罩”和“医用外科口罩”分类类目中，武汉红十字会仍有近六成发放情况不明。
But the figures show that nearly 60 percent of the urgently needed category of "N 95 and above masks" and "medical surgical masks" still remain undistributed.
此外，据《每日人物》2月16日报道，即便是不合规的物资，在前线也是一件难求。
In addition, even non-compliant items are difficult to obtain on the front lines, according to the Daily People report of 16 February.
数据显示，在不符合医用标准的“其他口罩”类别中，武汉红十字会也有近八成发放情况不明。
The Wuhan Red Cross also has an unclear distribution of nearly 80 percent of other masks that do not meet medical standards, according to the data.
在与疫情的对抗中，手套也是必要防护的物资，三地红十字均接收了百万双以上的手套。
Gloves are also a necessary safeguard in the fight against the outbreak, with the Red Cross receiving more than one million pairs of gloves in each of the three locations.
其中，黄冈市红十字会的手套发放比例是三地红十字会中最低的，仅为18.6%。
The Huanggang Red Cross has the lowest glove distribution rate of any of the three Red Cross societies, at 18.6 percent.
而收到了八百多万双手套的武汉市红十字会，也只将其中38.8%的手套分发了出去。
The Wuhan Red Cross Society, which received more than eight million pairs of braces, distributed only 38.8 percent of its gloves.
值得一提的是，在三家红十字会中收到手套数量最多的孝感，实现了将募捐到的99.9%的手套分发了出去。
It is worth mentioning that the greatest number of filial piety was received among the three Red Cross societies, which achieved the distribution of 99.9 per cent of the gloves collected.
此外，AI前哨站注意到疫情中的“抢手货”——免疫球蛋白，在武汉红十字会公示中仍没有相关去向。
In addition, AI outpost noted the epidemic in the "hot" - immunoglobulin, in Wuhan Red Cross has no relevant whereabouts.
1月25日，北京协和医院曾在治疗方案中，推荐用免疫球蛋白治疗重症患者。
On January 25, Beijing Concorde Hospital in the treatment program, recommended the use of immunoglobulin for the treatment of severe patients.
根据公示信息，AI前哨站估算，武汉市红十字会总计收到了5500支免疫球蛋白，但其发放情况从未公示。
According to public information, AI outposts estimated that the Wuhan Red Cross had received a total of 5,500 immunoglobulins, but the distribution was never made public.
同样收到了免疫球蛋白的黄冈市红十字会，在这一项上的发放比例也只有3.80%。
The Huanggang Red Cross, which also received the immunoglobulin, received only 3.80 percent of the total.
核酸等试剂盒发放也有同样的情况。
The same is true for the distribution of kits such as nucleic acids.
据公示信息，武汉市红十字会早在1月25日-1月26日间就收到了可供2万多人检测的核酸试剂盒数量，且在后续时间中也陆续收到捐赠。
According to public information, the Wuhan Red Cross Society received more than 20,000 nucleic acid test kits between January 25 and January 26, and received donations in the follow-up period.
然而，截至14日18时，发放情况仍旧不明，长达21天。
However, as at 1800 hours on 14 June, the distribution remained unclear for 21 days.
在2月5日，武汉市红十字会收到了“新型冠状病毒N-蛋白检测试剂盒”，直到2月11日，其中的18份试剂盒才发给到同济医院，耗时长达7天。
On February 5, the Wuhan Red Cross received a "new coronavirus N-protein test kit," of which 18 kits were delivered to Tongji Hospital on February 11, taking up to seven days.
物资发放流向不明，武汉口罩多流向市、各区防疫指挥部除了捐赠和发放数量，物资流向也是关注焦点。
The distribution of supplies to unknown, Wuhan mask flow to the city, epidemic prevention headquarters in addition to donations and distribution, the flow of materials is also the focus of attention.
据悉，武汉市疫情防控指挥部于1月26日通报说，防疫捐赠物资由武汉市新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情防控指挥部统一调配使用，武汉市红十字会将依法依规向社会公开捐赠接收、使用情况。
The Wuhan Red Cross Society will, according to regulations, make public the receipt and use of donations for epidemic prevention and treatment, Wuhan Red Cross Society reported on January 26.
这意味着，防疫捐赠物资的发放是由武汉市的新冠肺炎疫情防控指挥部来进行，而不是红十字会。
This means that the distribution of donated epidemic prevention materials is carried out by Wuhan's New Crown Pneumonia Command, not the Red Cross.
那么，新冠肺炎疫情防控指挥部将物资发向了哪里？根据武汉市红十字会公示信息，截至14日18时，社会各界捐赠的口罩最大的一部分流向了武汉市、各区防疫指挥部，占比为44.37%，作为对比，排名第二的各类医院只收到了其中的38.82%。
According to the Wuhan Red Cross Society, the largest proportion of face masks donated by the general public had gone to Wuhan city and regional epidemic prevention headquarters, accounting for 44.37 percent, compared with 38.82 percent for the second-ranking hospitals, according to the Wuhan Red Cross Society.
而排名第三的是各类政府机构，接收了16.31%的口罩。
Third on the list were various government agencies, which received 16.31 percent of the masks.
针对上述问题，有网民提出质疑，为何武汉市、各区防疫指挥部获得了比医院还要多的口罩数量？2月16日，武汉市红十字会就此问题发布说明，称“实际上，分配给各区级指挥部和管委会的医疗物资并非分发给工作人员，而是由各区级指挥部和管委会根据辖区内区属医院、各区卫生服务中心发热门诊、疑似病人隔离点等一线单位的疫情防控需要再进行二次分发。
On February 16, Wuhan city Red Cross issued a statement on the issue, saying: "In fact, the distribution of medical supplies to district commands and committees is based on the need for secondary distribution of first-line units such as district hospitals, district health service centres, and suspected patient isolation sites.
武汉市新冠肺炎疫情防控指挥部早有明确规定，所有我市公职人员均不能佩戴医用N95口罩，因此不存在工作人员占用医疗物资情况”。
The Wuhan New Crown Pneumonia Prevention and Control Command has clearly stipulated that all our city officials can not wear N95 medical masks, so there is no staff occupied medical supplies. "
结合此前南都报道，目前除了定向捐赠款物是直达定向单位的之外，非定向捐赠则是交由各区级指挥部和管委会。
As previously reported by both sides, at present, in addition to targeted donations are directly targeted units, non-targeted donations are handed over to district commands and management committees.
这些单位会根据一线单位的疫情防控需要，进行二次分发。
These units will be based on the first-line units of the need for disease prevention and control, secondary distribution.
各区（包括防疫指挥部、行政区）各类物资发放。
All kinds of materials are distributed in all districts (including epidemic prevention command, administrative districts).
至于为何需要二次分发？二次分发具体到了哪里去？武汉市红十字会和防疫指挥部并无进一步的解释和公示。
The Red Cross and Anti-epidemic Command of Wuhan City have no further explanation or public announcement as to why a second distribution is needed.
AI前哨站就相关问题致电武汉市红十字会，接电话的工作人员说，自己是志愿者，不了解相关情况，建议记者拨打相关媒体负责人的手机。
AI outpost call Wuhan Red Cross on related issues, answer the staff said, he is a volunteer, do not know the relevant situation, the reporter call the relevant media responsible for the mobile phone.
然而，该负责人的手机无人接听。
However, the person in charge's cell phone remained unanswered.
二次分发下落不明 部分政府机构获捐口罩数量超医院据公示信息，AI前哨站估算发现，“商务局”收到了六万多只口罩，比武汉市一些新冠肺炎定点医院还要多。
The number of masks donated to some government agencies is higher than hospitals According to public information, AI's outpost estimates the bureau has received more than 60,000 masks, more than some of Wuhan's designated hospitals for new crowns pneumonia.
2月4日，武汉市商务局曾在官网发布了《关于接收社会各界生活物资捐赠的说明》，其中提到“武汉市商务局负责生活物资的管理、分发及统筹处置工作。
On February 4, the Wuhan Bureau of Commerce issued a notice on receiving donations of living goods from all walks of life on its website, in which it said, "The Wuhan Bureau of Commerce is responsible for the management, distribution and overall disposal of living materials.
”而口罩显然不属于生活物资。
Masks, of course, are not a living thing.
除此之外，武汉市商务局再没有发布关于物资接收和发放明细的公告，公众也无法得知这六万多只口罩的流向。
Besides, Wuhan Bureau of Commerce has not issued any announcement on receiving and distributing detailed materials, nor can the public know the whereabouts of the more than 60,000 masks.
除了物资二次分发“下落不明”的情况，AI前哨站还发现，部分物资发放的公示信息模糊，一件物资的接收单位不止一家。
In addition to the "unaccounted for" secondary distribution, AI outposts also found that some of the material was distributed with vague information and that there were more than one receiving unit for one item.
比如，黄冈市红十字会在《黄冈市红十字会接收捐赠支出情况公示（六）》中写到，将“354361”只“普通口罩”发放给了28个单位，其中，既有包括黄州总医院、英山县人民医院在内的各类医院，也有市住建局、市城管执法委等行政单位，这三十多万只口罩到底如何分配？公示中并无进一步解释。
The Red Cross Society of Huanggang City, for example, reported in its "Notice on Receiving Donations by the Red Cross Society of Huanggang City" (VI) that "354,361" ordinary masks were distributed to 28 units, including the Huangzhou General Hospital and Yingshan County People's Hospital, as well as the URA and the Municipal Law Enforcement Commission.
三地红会公示表格不规范，物资数量、名称极为混乱一“捆”手套是多少双？一“蛇皮袋”口罩又有多少只？这正是AI前哨站在整理武汉市等地红十字会公示信息时，发出的“灵魂拷问”。
How many pairs of "bundles" of gloves? How many "snakeskin bags" masks? This is the "soul torture" issued by AI sentry in arranging information posted by the Red Cross Society of Wuhan and other places.
武汉市、黄冈市和孝感市红十字会均存在公示数量不清、计量单位极为混乱等情况，难以让公众清晰了解防疫物资的捐赠和发放情况。
Wuhan city, Huanggang City and Xiaogan City Red Cross Society have unclear number of publicity, extremely chaotic unit of measurement, and other circumstances, it is difficult to let the public clearly understand the donation and distribution of epidemic prevention materials.
例如，在武汉市红十字会官网的公示信息中，有660件接收社会捐赠的物资没有写清楚具体数量，出现了“捆”“件”“提”“大箱”“小袋”等多个模糊不清的计量单位，而且类似的问题在物资发放的公示中也存在。
For example, in the Wuhan Red Cross Red Cross official website, 660 items of material donated by the receiving society were not clearly written down. There were many vague units of measurement, such as "bundles," "boxes" and "bags," and similar problems existed in the publication of material distribution.
另外，在三地红十字会公示信息中还多次出现“口罩”“防护服”“护目镜”等物品名称，也难以让公众分辨其是否满足医院防疫使用的标准。
The names of items such as masks, protective clothing and goggles have repeatedly appeared in the Red Cross notices in the three places, making it difficult for the public to tell whether they meet the standards for hospital prophylaxis.
此外，在武汉市红十字会的公示信息中，还存在物资的接收和发放单位名称没有登记清晰的情况。
In addition, in Wuhan Red Cross Society public information, there are also material received and issued by the name of the unit is not clearly registered.
比如，根据公示信息，“融威公司”收到了六千多件包括口罩、手套、护目镜、防护服在内各类防疫物资，而根据公开信息显示，武汉市内有三家“融威公司”，分别为科技、汽车服务和押运保安服务公司。
For example, according to public information, Rongwei has received more than 6,000 epidemic prevention materials, including masks, gloves, goggles and protective clothing. According to public information, Wuhan City has three "integration companies," one for technology, the other for automotive services and security companies.
其中，“融威押运保安服务有限公司”为国有独资企业，投资了七家企业，经营范围包含门卫、巡逻、守护和武装押运。
Among them, "Rongwei Security Service Co., Ltd. is a state-owned enterprise, invested in seven enterprises, including guard, patrol, guard and armed escort.
注：由于武汉市、黄冈市和孝感市红十字会均存在公示数量不清、计量单位极为混乱等情况，对于部分没有清晰标明数量的物资，AI前哨站根据公示信息中，同类别、同规格的物资数量进行了估算。
Note: As Wuhan city, Huanggang City and Xiaogan City Red Cross Society are not clear number of publicity, measurement units are very confusing, some do not clearly marked the quantity of material, AI outpost based on the published information, the same type, the same specifications of the material has been estimated.
