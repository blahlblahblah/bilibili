他的儿子爱德华多（Eduardo Bolsonaro）在推特上表示，其父的检测过程还未完成，并谴责许多人在向媒体散布谣言。
On Twitter, his son Eduardo Bolsonaro said his father's testing process had not been completed and accused many people of spreading rumours to the media.

博索纳罗是否感染还未有定论，而他之前的四天（3月7日-11日）访美之行也受到广泛关注。
Whether Bosonaro is infected remains an open question, and his four-day visit to the United States, from March 7 to 11, has also attracted widespread attention.

白宫曾发声明称，特朗普和彭斯与沃恩加藤几乎没有交流。

白宫也发声明称特朗普和彭斯无需接受病毒检测。

与特朗普一样，博索纳罗也曾对新冠肺炎疫情颇为“不以为意”。

他在访问迈阿密时曾说，过去一年经历了多次危机时刻，但很多都只是幻想，新冠肺炎疫情也没有像主流媒体描述的那样糟糕。
During his visit to Miami, he said that the past year had seen many moments of crisis, but much of it had been illusory, and the New Crown Pneumonia epidemic was not as bad as the mainstream media described it.
