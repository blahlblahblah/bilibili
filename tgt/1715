深度和角度——这就是我们能做的。
Depth and angle - that's what we can do.

做公益，只凭“鸡血”“热情”，这是不行的。
Do public welfare, only "chicken blood" "enthusiasm," this is not possible.
口述 | 周健（北京感恩公益基金会理事长）整理 | 王煜这些天以来，许多事情让我非常揪心。
Zhou Jian, director of the Beijing Thanksgiving Public Welfare Foundation, has let me worry about a lot of things these days.
湖南衡山县的乡镇医生宋英杰，连续十几天在抗疫岗位上工作，过劳去世，因公殉职时不满28岁。
Song Yingjie, a township doctor in Hengshan County, Hunan province, worked in an anti-epidemic post for more than 10 days.
宋英杰的父母经营苗圃为生，因为疫情，从地里挖出来的树苗都卖不出去，这意味着一家人除了遭受精神重创，他们的实际生活也遭遇了巨大的困难。
Song Yingjie's parents ran nurseries for a living because of the outbreak, and the fact that they could not sell the seedlings from the fields meant that the family suffered not only mental damage, but also great difficulties in their real life.
宋英杰在抗击疫情岗位上的自拍照来源 |衡阳广电网和宋英杰一样，现在几乎每天都有医护人员、基层干部、公安干警、媒体记者、志愿者等，在防疫一线冒着生命危险在战斗。
Hengyang Broadcast, like Song Yingjie, now has health-care workers, basic-level cadres, police officers, media reporters and volunteers almost every day, risking their lives on the frontline of epidemic prevention.
而我们呢？付出的仅仅是时间和精力。
And what about us? It's just time and energy.
我们是一家公益组织，该怎么帮助这些在疫情中做出贡献，而自身又因此面临困难的人和他的家庭？1月下旬疫情刚开始爆发时，我就开始思考这个问题。
How can we help people and their families who have contributed to the epidemic and who are themselves in trouble? I started thinking about it when the outbreak began in late January.
在此前的汶川地震、芦山地震时，我都曾和伙伴们一起，直接把捐献的物资送到灾民手中；但我发现这次抗疫一线需要的医疗物资是非常专业的，我们没有专业的鉴别能力，很容易买到不符合要求的东西。
In the previous Wenchuan earthquake, Lushan earthquake, I have been directly with partners to the victims of the disaster, but I found that the first-line need of the epidemic medical supplies is very professional, we do not have the professional discrimination, easy to buy things do not meet the requirements.
如果用捐赠人的善款买到的是假货，这是我无法接受的。
It would be unacceptable to me if the donor's money were to be used to buy fake goods.
所以，我们没有涉及物资的捐助，而是关注抗疫中具体的人。
So, instead of giving money involving supplies, we are focusing on specific people in the fight against the disease.
进入公益领域十多年来，我看到了灾难带给人的“后遗症”的许多真实情况。
More than a decade into the public welfare sector, I have seen the disaster brought "after-effects" of many real situations.
尤其是那些在救灾中做出贡献的人，应该得到公益组织持续的支持，我们不能和普通大众一样，基于情绪参与其中。
Those who contribute to disaster relief, in particular, deserve the continued support of public interest groups, and we cannot participate on an emotional basis, as the general public does.
这是专业的公益组织与社会大众的不同。
It is a difference between a professional public interest organization and the general public.
在灾难发生时，他们在聚光灯下被赞誉为英雄；而事情结束后，他们或者他们的家庭还要面临长期的实际困难，这不该被忽视。
In times of disaster, they are praised as heroes in the spotlight; when things are over, they or their families face long-term practical difficulties that should not be overlooked.
对于殉职人员，除了一次性支付的抚恤金之外，我们还要为他们的父母提供终身的赡养支持，为他们的未成年子女提供教育支持，直到大学本科毕业。
For those who have lost their lives, in addition to the lump-sum pension, we provide lifelong support for their parents and educational support for their minor children until they graduate from college.
他们是疫情中所有人的守护者，而我们要做他们的后盾。
They are the guardians of all the people in the epidemic, and we are their backing.
按照这样的想法，我们发起了“守护者后盾行动”，1月27日（年初三）开始上线筹款。
Along these lines, we launched Operation Guardian's backing, which began raising money on January 27 (New Year's Day).
后来我们觉得，除了关注因公致伤致残和殉职的一线人员，我们也应该关注那些在抗疫中做出特别贡献的人，又在项目中设置了“特别贡献支持”。
Later, we felt that, in addition to focusing on frontline personnel who had been disabled and killed in the line of duty, we should also pay attention to those who had made a special contribution to the fight against the disease, adding "special contribution support" to the project.
第一个“特别贡献支持”的资助者是李文亮医生，与他确认这项资助时，他还在住院治疗。
The first contributor to Special Contribution Support was Dr. Lee Wenliang, who was hospitalized when he confirmed the funding.
他答应将他的相片形象授权给我们，去为这个项目筹集更多的善款。
He promised to delegate his photo image to us to raise more money for the project.
让人痛心的是他最后不治去世。
Sadly, he died in the end.
“守护者后盾行动”将按项目设计，为他的家庭提供持续的支持。
Operation Guardian's backing will be designed to provide ongoing support to his family.
李文亮发给周健的自拍照，摄于2020年2月3日受访者供图获得“特别贡献支持”的还有最早把新冠肺炎疫情上报疾控系统的湖北省中西医结合医院张继先医生和医院的临床业务管理团队共17人。
Li sent Zhou Jian a photo of himself. On February 3, 2020, 17 people from the Hubei Province Chinese and Western Medical Association Hospital, Zhang Jixian, and the hospital's clinical operations management team, were the first to report the outbreak of new crown pneumonia to the disease control system.
我们还计划为100位在疫情一线“逆行”的媒体记者提供资助。
We also plan to fund 100 media journalists who are "retrograde" in the first line of the epidemic.
希望大家能够记住他们的贡献。
I hope that their contributions will be remembered.
目前我们已经搜集了全国各地370条需要帮助的人的线索，正逐条核实确认；已经资助了31人。
So far, we have collected 370 leads from around the country on people in need, which are being verified on an article-by-article basis; 31 have been funded.
每一项资助都要有规范完整和公开透明的程序，工作量真的非常大。
Each grant is subject to a well-regulated and transparent process, and the workload is truly enormous.
现在整个基金会十几个全职人员与全国各地的150多名志愿者，都扑在这个事情上。
More than a dozen full-time members of the foundation and more than 150 volunteers around the country are now working on the issue.
我们有一个群，里面有190多个武汉因公感染新冠肺炎的医护人员，我们和他们保持联系，当他们需要时，我们立即提供支持。
We have a group of more than 190 Wuhan staff who have contracted SARS as a result of their service, and we keep in touch with them and provide immediate support when they need it.
从年初一到现在，我每天只洗澡不洗脸，睁开眼就坐到电脑前开始工作，饿了就随便吃点东西填填肚子。
From the first day of the new year to the present, I only bathe do not wash face, open their eyes to sit in front of the computer began to work, hungry just eat something to fill the belly.
最忙的时候一天只能睡三四个小时，而且那几个小时我必须把手机关掉才能睡着，要不半夜也会不断收到各种要处理的信息。
I sleep only three or four hours a day during the busiest hours, and I have to turn off my hands during those hours to fall asleep or else I keep getting all the information I need to deal with at midnight.
这个项目在民政部门备案后，有些人觉得这件事“并不紧急”，不愿意支持；但是后来他们发现筹了不少钱但是买不到抗疫物资或者送不进去时，开始认同“支持具体的人”。
After the civil affairs department filed the case, some people felt it was "not urgent" and unwilling to support it; but later they found out that they had raised a lot of money but could not buy anti-epidemic supplies or were unable to get in, they began to identify with "support specific people."
目前项目已经筹集了3000多万元的善款，这来自400万人次的捐献，这个项目也开了行业的先河，现在陆续有不少其他的公益组织上线了对抗疫工作者的资助项目。
The project, which has raised more than 30 million yuan in donations from four million people, is the first of its kind in the industry, and a number of other public interest groups have joined the fight against the epidemic.
“守护者后盾行动”海报受访者供图这次疫情以来，我一直在想：近十几年来，我们国家的经济发展很快，老百姓手里的余钱多了，参与社会公共事务的意愿也逐渐在增强；整个国家的救灾能力也增强了很多。
Since the beginning of this epidemic, I have been thinking: In the last decade or so, the economy of our country has developed rapidly, the people have more money left in their hands, and their willingness to participate in public affairs has gradually increased; and the overall national disaster relief capacity has been greatly enhanced.
可是，公益组织在这次疫情里的整体表现，并不令人满意。
However, the overall performance of public interest groups in the epidemic is not satisfactory.
面对来自全国各地上百亿元的捐助，武汉的红十字会、慈善总会肯定是超负荷工作了，但这不是他们没有做好工作的理由。
Wuhan Red Cross and charity associations must have been overworked by donations of tens of billions of yuan from all over the country, but that's no reason why they haven't done their job well.
我相信志愿者团队、民间公益组织是有意愿有能力来协助做好这些工作的，但当地政府没有给民间公益组织足够的信任。
I believe that volunteer groups and non-governmental organizations have the will and ability to assist in these efforts, but the local government does not give enough trust to civil society organizations.
我们一些做物资捐赠的公益组织做得也不好。
Some of our public-interest groups that donate goods are not doing very well either.
有些是从网上筹了几千万元，然后鼠标一点，转给当地红十字会或慈善总会就算参与了救灾。
Some raised tens of millions of dollars from the Internet, and then mouse a little, referred to the local Red Cross or the General Association of Charities even participated in the disaster relief.
做得好一点的，通宵达旦地工作，在全世界买口罩，买完了，送到红十字会或慈善总会就算项目完成。
Well done, work all night, buy masks all over the world, buy them, and send them to the Red Cross or the General Association of Charities.
做公益，只凭“鸡血”“热情”，这是不行的。
Do public welfare, only "chicken blood" "enthusiasm," this is not possible.
既然要捐献物资，就要把从募捐到受助人手里的全链条做好。
Since the donation of goods, from the collection to the hands of recipients of the chain to do well.
当然这次的疫情和之前的地震等自然灾害不一样，因为防疫的要求，人要进到一线有更多的困难；但就算公益组织在外面的人进不去，就没有当地的志愿者可以对接吗？如果只会筹款和采购，却打不进一线，公益组织的战斗力又有多少呢？2008年，5·12汶川地震的时候，我和新浪论坛联合发起了一个公益项目叫“灾区直通车”。
Of course, this epidemic is different from previous earthquakes and other natural disasters, because epidemic prevention requirements, there are more difficulties to access the front line, even if the public interest organizations outside the people can not access it? If only fund-raising and procurement, but can not hit the frontline, the public welfare organizations and I launched a joint public welfare project called "through train.
我们第二天就开始从北京运送救灾物资到四川。
We began sending relief supplies from Beijing to Sichuan the next day.
我们第一批从北京出发的物资三百件免包扎绷带，13日夜里送到极重灾区的什邡人民医院，马上就用到了病人的身上。
The first batch of 300 unbound bandages from Beijing was sent to Shifang People's Hospital in the earthquake-stricken area on the night of 13th.
后来，我们差不多运了上百趟飞机的救灾物资，基本上做到了北京头天捐赠，第二天就出现在四川灾民的手里。
Later, we almost transported hundreds of flights of relief materials, basically made Beijing's first day of donation, the next day in Sichuan victims of the hands.
诀窍是，我们知道当地政府都忙着去救埋在废墟里的人，根本没时间搭理我们，我们需要自己来做落地。
The trick is, we know that the local government is too busy trying to save people buried in the rubble to pay any attention to us. We need to land on our own.
“灾区直通车”第一趟飞机的物资还没有发出，我就委托成都的朋友陈妍，在当地组织了一支志愿者队伍，负责每天从双流机场把物资运到什邡。
Before the supplies for the first flight from the disaster area were dispatched, I asked Chen Yan, a friend of Chengdu, to organize a volunteer team there to transport supplies daily from the twin-flow airport to Shifang.
他们每天去双流机场提三次货，从机场直接就运到什邡，在什邡救灾指挥部登记后，并不把货放到仓库完事，而是直接发到村里面，组织村民来分发。
After registering at Shifang Disaster Relief Command, instead of delivering the goods to the warehouse, they send them directly to the village, where they organize the villagers to distribute them.
周健（右一）在芦山地震救灾现场受访者供图后来，在2013年芦山地震中，我们也采用了同样的模式。
Zhou Jian (first from the right) gave a map to the respondents at the Lushan earthquake relief site. Later, we used the same pattern in the 2013 Lushan earthquake.
我4月20日中午从北京飞成都，带着六车救灾物资到雅安的时候，已经是夜里十点半了。
It was half past ten in the night when I flew from Beijing to Chengdu at noon on April 20th, carrying six carts of relief supplies to Ya'an.
路被封了，武警设卡站岗，所有的车都进不去。
The road is blocked. The armed police are on guard. All the cars can't get in.
我们当时用了最笨的办法，把救灾物资用三轮车、用板车，用人力，用蚂蚁搬家的方式，一点点搬运到关卡以内，一直忙到早上六点多。
We used the stupidest way, using tricycles, rickshaws, manpower, ants to move, little by little, until more than six in the morning.
如果这次疫情中，多一些公益组织能这样做，会不会好一些？我们做公益，要对捐献者、对社会公众真诚。
Would it have been better if more charities had done so in this epidemic? We have done the public good, to the donors, to the public.
只说别人想听的话、老是蹭“热点”，那是更多心思放在谋求组织本身的利益上，不是做公益的初心。
Just saying what other people want to hear and rubbing "hot spots" is more interested in pursuing the interests of the organization itself than in the public interest.
希望这次疫情中暴露出来的问题，能让更多公益人反思警醒。
It is hoped that this epidemic exposed the problem, can let more public welfare people reflect on the wake-up.
