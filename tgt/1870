前线医护人员的卫生巾和安心裤还够吗？2月6日，24岁的女孩梁钰在微博上发问：“前线医护人员的卫生巾和考拉裤还够吗？这么多的女性医护人员是如何解决她们的月经问题啊？现在防护服不够，想必也是一片卫生巾用一天，也很容易感染吧。
Are front-line health care workers' sanitary towels and comfort pants enough? "On Feb. 6, 24-year-old Liang Yu asked on Weibo:" Are sanitary towels and koalas enough for front-line medical staff? How do so many female health care workers solve their menstrual problems?
”这个提问，让更多人开始关注到之前被忽略的问题：一线女性医护人员急需卫生巾、安心裤（裤型卫生巾）。
The question has drawn more attention to a previously overlooked issue: the urgent need for sanitary towels and slacks for front-line women health-care workers.
据中国妇女报统计，截至2月9日，全国共有19800名左右的医护人员驰援武汉，其中护士约14000人，驰援武汉的14000人的护士队伍当中，女性占比接近90%。
According to the China Women's Daily, as of February 9, about 19,800 medical personnel had rushed to Wuhan, about 14,000 of them nurses, and nearly 90 percent of the 14,000 nurses who had helped Wuhan.
随着全国各地援鄂医疗队数量的不断增加，女性医护人员的数量仍在增加。
With the increasing number of medical teams in Hubei province all over the country, the number of female medical workers is still increasing.
2月2日，上海市妇联将募集到的100箱考拉裤送往武汉前线的医护人员手中。
On February 2, the Shanghai Women's Federation sent 100 cases of koalas collected to hospital staff on the Wuhan front.
但身在湖北的女性医护人员数量多、物资消耗快，缺口仍然很大。
But in Hubei the number of female medical personnel is large, the material consumption is fast, the gap is still very big.
发起行动防护服对一线的医护人员来说是奢侈品，再加上穿脱防护服过程繁复，需耗时将近1小时，因此穿着防护服的时候她们选择不吃不喝，一天工作时长平均6-10个小时，生理期的时候还要忍受无法及时更换卫生巾的尴尬。
Because mobile protective clothing is a luxury for front-line health-care workers, and because of the complexity of wearing protective clothing, which can take nearly an hour, they choose not to eat or drink while wearing protective clothing. They work an average of 6-10 hours a day and have to endure the embarrassment of not being able to change sanitary towels in time.
她们在工作时要忍受密闭的防护服带来的缺氧感，长时间戴着护目镜和口罩，脸上被勒出深深的勒痕，紧紧固定在手上的手套脱掉后，手腕上也会出现一道勒痕，又痒又疼。
At work, they suffer from hypoxia caused by closed protective clothing, prolonged wear of goggles and masks, deep strangulation marks on their faces, and a strangulation on their wrists following the removal of gloves firmly fixed to their hands, itching and painful.
一线女性医护人员的身体承受着巨大的压力。
The bodies of front-line female health care workers are under tremendous pressure.
为了解决超过10万名女性医护人员的卫生巾需求缺口和大量一次性内裤需求，梁钰的志愿者团队联合灵山慈善基金会发起了“姐妹战疫安心行动”，将募集资金用于支援一线抗疫医护人员，截至2月20日22:00，安心行动筹款总数为2362051.96元，募捐及协调捐赠总计：338317条安心裤（裤型卫生巾），202209条一次性内裤，卫生巾2880片，护手霜700支，覆盖武汉、黄冈、孝感、鄂州等地79家（支）医院和医疗队，超60000名一线工作者。
In order to address the shortage of sanitary towels for more than 100,000 female medical workers and the need for a large number of disposable underwear, Liang Yu's volunteer team launched "Operation Ease of Sisters of War Disease" to raise funds to support frontline anti-epidemic medical personnel.
图/受访者提供下同在梁钰发起安心行动后，有网友质疑，为何医院不派专人采购卫生巾和安心裤？送货效率太低，为何不选择直接给医护打钱？梁钰觉得无奈，网友们对湖北省内的物流情况以及一线医护人员的真实生活状况，仍然了解不足。
Photo / Interviewee: After the launch of the campaign, some netizens questioned why hospitals do not send staff to purchase sanitary towels and comfort pants. The efficiency of delivery is too low. Why not pay for medical care directly?
1月23日，武汉封城，随后，湖北其他城市也陆续封城、进行交通管制，开车上路、过桥都需要到疫情指挥部申请通行证，出行困难。
On January 23, Wuhan closed the city, and then other cities in Hubei also blocked the city, traffic control, driving on the road, crossing the bridge need to apply for permits to the epidemic headquarters, travel difficulties.
此外，医护人员的工作时间非常长，在她们下班后，超市也基本结束营业，并且医护人员为了避免交叉感染，轻易不会去超市等人流密集区，电商APP也很难抢购成功，快递也成了薛定谔的快递，有时候能寄送到，有时候寄送不到。
In addition, the working hours of the medical staff are very long, the supermarkets are almost closed after work, and the medical staff, in order to avoid cross-infection, do not easily go to the crowded areas such as supermarkets. APP is also very difficult to snag up, and express delivery has become Schrodinger's express.
物流难题梁钰和志愿者团队，跟几家建立合作的物流公司和志愿者车队，每天拉着采购、募捐来的卫生巾、安心裤和一次性内裤，送往各大医院。
Mr. Leung and a team of volunteers, together with a team of logistics companies and volunteers to set up a daily procurement, fund-raising sanitary napkins, comfort pants and disposable underwear, to the major hospitals.
物流仍是安心行动目前面临的最大难题，“湖北省内的物流情况相当复杂，每天都有不同的政策，每去一个地方都要办理当地的通行证，这很困难，而且我们办了通行证也不知道去了当地，能否顺利分发给各个医院。
"The logistics situation in Hubei province is quite complicated, there are different policies every day, it is difficult to get a local pass to every place, and we don't know where to get a pass and whether it can be distributed to hospitals smoothly.
”从行动开始后的每天，都是未知的，“每一天的政策都在变，每天晚上我们都在问是否有新的政策，我们永远也不知道第二天车队能不能顺利出来，通行证能不能办到，就算拿到了一个全省通行证，但通行证还会过期，每天都要办，我们根本不能保证明天能不能办下来。
Every day after the start of the operation, it was unknown. "Every day the policy is changing. Every night we ask if there is a new policy. We never know if the team will make it out the next day, if we get a provincial pass, it will expire every day, and we have no guarantee that it will happen tomorrow.
”但是志愿者车队总是能在困难中想出办法来，志愿者笛子带着车队从一大早出门工作到凌晨12点，其中一天送了17家医院，效率非常高，梁钰对《中国新闻周刊》说，“志愿者车队非常不容易，首先他们要解决自己出门的问题，然后我们在市内建了一个仓库，这是好心人借给我们的，志愿者就在仓库等，等司机把货拉到仓库，车队再进行分拣，分拣好后送到医院。
But volunteer teams always come up with ways to solve problems. Volunteer flutes work early in the morning and work until 12: 00 a.m., 17 of which are very efficient. "The volunteer caravan is not easy," Liang told China News Weekly.
”志愿者运送物资目前，安心行动还没有克服省外物资运往省内的物流问题，因此她们仍然在努力寻找湖北省内的货源，精打细算，尽量花最少的钱，买到最多的东西。
"Volunteers are delivering supplies, and peace of mind has not overcome the logistical problems involved in getting supplies out of the province, so they are still trying to find supplies in Hubei province, economize, spend as little as possible and buy the most.
物资缺口仍然很大一线女性医护人员数量庞大，卫生巾、安心裤、一次性内裤这些日用消耗品的消耗也非常大，因此安心行动的物资缺口经常让梁钰感到力不从心，“我们可能也没有那么大的力量去覆盖这么大的缺口，目前志愿者的工作量比较大，大家都比较辛苦。
The material gap is still very large number of first-line female medical personnel, sanitary napkins, comfort pants, disposable underwear and other consumables consumption is also very large, so ease of movement of the material gap often make Liang Yu feel powerless, "we may not have the strength to cover such a large gap, the current workload of volunteers, we are more laborious.
”安心行动的志愿者团队目前超过60人，全员已是满负荷工作状态，成员从75后到00后都有。
The team of volunteers for the operation now numbers more than 60, all of whom have been working at full capacity since the start of the 75th to 2000s.
梁钰坦言，她一开始也没想搞这么大，“刚开始我只是想自己和朋友们买一点物资，凑钱捐款就好。
"At the beginning, I just wanted to buy some materials for myself and my friends, so I would just like to make a donation.
刚开始，我在淘宝上找发货地是湖北的商家谈，然后联系湖北医护的需求，我在黄冈的朋友联系了当地的医院，反馈回来的需求量比我想的要大。
In the beginning, I looked for goods on Taobao is Hubei businessmen talk, and then contact Hubei medical needs, my friends in Huanggang contact the local hospital, feedback back more than I thought.
”随后，梁钰发了一条微博，引起大量关注，很多商家联系她帮忙对接湖北省的医院捐赠，也有大量网友捐款，希望能帮到一线的女性医护人员能够更加安心工作。
Subsequently, Liang Yufa a micro-blog, attracted a lot of attention, many businessmen contacted her to help docking hospitals in Hubei Province, but also a large number of netizens donated money, hoping to help female front-line medical workers feel more at ease about their jobs.
起初，很多医院的对接人并不清楚安心裤和纸尿裤的区别，梁钰和志愿者需要耐心解释二者的区别，讲清楚这是一线女性医护必需的生活用品，医院方面大多非常配合，并且积极想办法配合运输、接收物资。
At first, many hospital docking people do not know the difference between comfortable pants and diapers. Liang Yu and the volunteers need to explain the difference between the two.
医护人员接收物资据梁钰了解，很多援鄂医疗队从动身到出发的时间很短，很多医护人员没来得及准备充足日用品就出发了，再加上医护人员在隔离区内穿的衣服不可以穿到隔离区外，内衣裤消耗量很大，“有的医疗队成员就带了一套秋衣秋裤，每天让阿姨用84消毒液消毒，消毒后第二天不管干不干都穿上，武汉天气湿冷，可想而知多难受。
According to Leung Yu, many medical support teams left before they could prepare enough daily necessities. Besides, many medical workers were not allowed to wear clothes outside the area of separation and their underwear was consumed very expensive.Some members of the medical team took an autumn suit and disinfected them with 84 disinfectant every day.
”但是，梁钰仍然清楚，物资数量有限，每个医院有各自的分配方法，因此物资不可能分到每一个医护手中，“我们目前唯一能做的就是让志愿者团队的对接组联系医院反馈发放情况，也有的医护会私信我来反馈发放情况。
"However, it is still clear that the quantity of supplies is limited and that each hospital has its own method of distribution, so it is impossible to distribute the supplies to every care-giver.
我们下一步的计划是，对接组继续询问医院是否已发放，如果对方给不出个所以然来，我们就直接在微博上@医院官微，问到底怎么回事？是否分发有问题？需不需要我们帮助？”看见女性劳动者在安心行动进行过程中，梁钰总会被一线女性医护人员的乐观、坚强以及强大的职业能力所感染，她认为，“我们应该看见女性劳动者的力量，女性的战斗力是非常强的。
Our next step is to ask the docking team if the hospital has been issued. If the other side does not give us a reason, we will go directly to the micro-blog and ask what is the matter? Is there any distribution problem? Do you need our help?
”梁钰在微博上发起安心行动后，经常能收到大量来自一线医护人员的私信，有求助、感谢，也有人只是想跟她聊聊天，分享一线工作的见闻和感受，她称这些在一线奋斗的女性医护人员为“姐妹”。
"After launching her own peace of mind campaign on Weibo, Liang frequently received a large number of personal letters from front-line medical staff, ranging from asking for help and thanks to others who just wanted to talk to her and share their first-line experiences and feelings.
2月11日，安心行动公开募集的资金还没有到账，梁钰收到了海南医疗队支援武汉方舱医院护士的求助私信，这位护士的同事来月经了，但纸尿裤差不多快用完了，“我同事今天血和尿都混在一起了，太难了”。
On February 11, the funds raised by Operation Relieve have not arrived yet, and Liang Yu received a private letter from the medical team from Hainan to support the nurse at Wuhan Fangkang Hospital. The nurse's colleague came to his menstrual period, but his diapers were running out.
梁钰看到私信后，到处去求有没有在武汉的志愿者和志愿者车队可以帮忙，她找到了志愿者笛子。
When Liang Yu saw the private letter, she went around asking for volunteers and volunteer caravan in Wuhan to help, she found a volunteer flute.
笛子第二天一早就跑出去到处寻找物资，到了下午终于买到了物资给医院的护士送了过去。
The flute went out early the next morning looking for supplies, but in the afternoon he finally got supplies for the nurse in the hospital.
志愿者笛子将物资送到海南医疗队手中私信里最让梁钰感慨的一条留言是，“感谢你，我们再也不用穿着带血的防护服走来走去了。
"Thanks to you, we don't have to walk around in bloody suits anymore," wrote Leung Yu, one of the messages in the personal letter sent by the volunteer flute to the Hainan medical team.
”但是梁钰感到很愧疚，物资缺口太大，安心行动的能力毕竟有限，不可能照顾到所有的医护，再加上有些医护会把物资让给患者，缺口就会更大。
"However, Liang Yu felt guilty, the material gap is too large, the ability to ease action is limited, it is impossible to take care of all the medical care, and some medical care will give up supplies to patients, the gap will be even greater.
梁钰补充道：“有男警来找我们咨询，物资能不能给女警一点，他们说实在不行就自己想办法号召，大家一起想办法。
"Some men came to us for advice, materials can give a little to the policewomen, they said it is impossible to do their own way to call, we think together.
”抗疫的战斗依然绵长，除了一线的医护人员外，还有很多在抗疫工作一线的女性劳动者，比如长时间执勤的女警，她们的需求同样也不应被忽视。
The battle against the epidemic continues unabated, and the needs of many female workers on the frontlines of the epidemic, such as policewomen on long duty, should not be overlooked, in addition to front-line health workers.
