虽然每天尽量不出门，但买汏烧省不了，现在菜场蔬菜供应充足了，但买菜安全，有时候还是会担心。
Although every day try not to go out, but buy a burn can not save, now the vegetable market is full of vegetables, but buy safe, sometimes still worry.
好在现在进菜场就要测量体温，不戴口罩不让进，感觉比较安全，摊主也会鼓励我们用手机扫码支付，减少大家支付现金时的接触。
Fortunately, now into the market to take temperature, do not wear masks to enter, feel safer, vendors will also encourage us to use mobile phones to clean payment, reduce everyone's cash when the contact.

"In places like the Halles, where people's lives are closely related, it is important to attach great importance to keeping the risk of possible transmission to a small scale."
”静安区卫健委、区爱卫办李彦玲科长告诉《新民周刊》记者。
"Jingan District Health Committee, District Aiwei office Li Yanling section chief told" Xinmin Weekly "reporters.
据武定菜市场负责人胡禹介绍，1月31日接到区爱卫办的指导意见后，他们立刻组织人手在菜市场内寻找符合条件的地点，“这个点不能设置在室内，要通风”。
According to Wu Ding vegetable market manager Yu Hu, January 31 received District Aiwei's guidance, they immediately organized people in the Halles market to find a qualified location, "this point can not be set indoors, ventilation.

”02垃圾厢房、公厕、公租房同样地，垃圾厢房、公厕、公租房等消毒问题，也是市民比较关注的地点。
Waste compartments, public toilets and public rental housing are also areas of public concern, as are disinfection of refuse compartments, public toilets and public rental housing.
“如果这些市民目前仍会接触到的公共环境的清洁和预防性消毒做好了，其实很大程度上就能有效切断公共传播的途径，降低社区传播风险。
"If the cleanliness and preventive disinfection of the public environment to which these citizens are still exposed are in place, it will be largely effective in cutting off public access and reducing the risk of community transmission."
”李彦玲表示。

而对辖区内的公厕消毒方面，张乐平表示，除了每天早中晚至少三次的全面消毒之外，现在所有公厕均采取“跟踪式消毒”，有人使用之后，保洁员立即会对门把手、台盆、水龙头等接触的区域进行消毒。
As for the disinfection of public toilets in his district, Zhang said all public toilets were now "followed-up disinfection" except for at least three thorough disinfection in the morning and evening of each day.

据张乐平介绍，一是进一步强化人员管控，公租房项目不再接受访客入内；二是采取集中式项目管家模式，开展24小时出入租户体温测量及上岗员工每天体温测量，并做好登记工作，如发现发热情况，立即安排就医，上报并进行跟踪；三是增加公共空间、楼道、电梯等场所保洁工作的频次，并按要求做好消毒工作，全方位减少病毒存在的可能，全力保障租户的健康。
According to Zhang, public rental housing projects are no longer open to visitors. Second, a centralized project housekeeper model is adopted to conduct 24-hour temperature check-ups for tenants and onboarding staff.
摄影 | 应琛“对公租房的公共区域的消毒，从原来的一周一次变成每天三四次，像门厅、电梯间这种使用比较频繁的地方，我们的要求是4次消毒。
Rest & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & nbsp; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45
然后像消防通道、公共洗衣房、晾衣服的天井这些以前会忽略的地方，基本上也要保持3次消毒。
Then keep disinfecting areas such as fire escape, public laundry, clothes-drying patio, which used to be neglected, basically three times.
我们争取是做到不放过任何一个卫生死角。
We strive to keep any health corner alive.
所有消毒剂都是根据规范配比来做的。
All disinfectants are prepared in accordance with the specifications.
”张乐平表示。
Mr Zhang said.
此外，为了做好全区公租房预防性消毒工作，城发集团闸北公租房公司按照区卫生健康委、区爱卫办统一部署，对全区所有公租房629名租户开展全面排摸，每日上门询问或电话询问，确保信息全面了解掌握，有效落实“对进入上海的人员一律测量体温、对来自重点地区的人员一律实施医学观察、对其他外来地区人员一律申报信息给相关部门”的工作要求。

03 Office space tomorrow (February 3) is about to usher in the rework peak of some enterprises, Li Yan Ling said the district in January 31 meeting has been corresponding to the deployment, "office space will be the next prevention and control focus.
我们在未来几天可能会到一些办公楼宇进行重点督查”。

“事实上，上海市疾控中心很早就下发了十类场所的消毒指导。
"In fact, the Shanghai CDC issued guidance on disinfection of ten types of sites very early.
而市民最关心的就是居住场所和一些会接触到的公共场所。
And the public is most concerned about the place of residence and some public places will come into contact.
”李彦玲说，静安区相关部门如此细致全面的工作，一方面希望能够踩准每一个点，坚决杜绝防控漏洞的出现；而另一方面则希望大家能够科学地进行必要的消毒，不要过度消毒。
Robin Li said the work of the relevant departments in Jing'an District was so detailed and comprehensive that, on the one hand, they wanted to step on every point and resolutely stop the emergence of loopholes, while on the other hand, they wanted everyone to disinfect scientifically and not to disinfect excessively.
图片来源于网络除了勤洗手之外，例如，在办公室能够以通风为主，尽量避免开空调；在家也要经常开窗通风。
In addition to washing your hands frequently, the network, for example, can be ventilation in the office, avoid to turn on the air-conditioning; and often open windows ventilation at home.
“如果家里没有病患、密切接触者或者需要隔离的病人，我们不主张每天用消毒液擦拭，当然每天清扫和清洁是需要的。
"If there are no patients, close contacts or patients in need of isolation, we don't recommend using disinfectant every day, of course, cleaning and cleaning are needed every day.
像现在这个季节，每周一次消毒就够了。
A weekly sanitization is enough for this season.
但针对厕所，以及经常洗手的洗手台可以每天用低浓度的消毒液进行消毒，在半小时之后一定要用清水擦一下，去残留不对人体有刺激，以及减轻消毒剂的腐蚀。
But for the toilet, as well as wash hands frequently hand washers can be disinfected daily with low concentrations of disinfectant, after half an hour must be wiped with water, to remove residual does not stimulate the human body, and to reduce the corrosion of disinfectant.
