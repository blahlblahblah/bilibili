上海市家协从防疫之初，就明确了“防疫情”和“保刚需”这两个目标。
Shanghai National Association from the beginning of epidemic prevention, clear "epidemic prevention" and "Baogang needs" these two goals.
此次疫情也充分反映出家政行业的特殊性，无论是马上要实施的《上海市家政服务条例》，还是去年国务院提出的“促进家政服务业提质扩容36条”都是希望家政行业能够尽快走向员工制管理。
The epidemic also reflects the special nature of the domestic service industry, whether it is to be implemented immediately the Shanghai Domestic Service Regulations, or last year's State Council's "36 Regulations to Promote the Qualification and Expansion of Domestic Service" are intended to help the domestic industry move towards employee management as soon as possible.
记者 | 应　琛一场突如其来的疫情，打乱了所有人的工作安排和生活节奏。
Rest & # 124; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
封城、封路、封小区……其影响波及各行各业。
Sealing the city, sealing the road, sealing the community... its impact affected all walks of life.
随着疫情防控释放出积极信号，连日来各部门相关政策陆续出台，企业复工复产有序展开。
With the release of positive signals of disease prevention and control, the relevant policies of various departments have been issued in the past few days, enterprises resume production orderly.
但对于家政行业来说，由于行业的特殊性，从业人员免不了与人密切接触，其复工之路更为艰难。
But for the domestic industry, due to the particularity of the industry, employees are inevitably in close contact with people, its return to work is more difficult.
2月29日，为帮助餐饮、家政、美容美发等居民生活服务业复工复产复市，上海市商务委已下发《关于推动居民生活服务业复工复产的通知》（以下简称“通知”）。
On February 29, the Shanghai Commerce Commission issued the Notice on Promoting the Resumption of Work in the Domestic Service Industry (hereinafter referred to as "Notice") to help the catering, domestic service and beauty and hair services industries resume production.
《通知》要求各区商务主管部门要积极会同相关部门、各街（镇），指导餐饮、家政和美发企业严格落实防控措施，对符合“工作指引”的相关企业积极推动复工复产。
The Circular requires commercial departments in all districts to actively work with the relevant departments and streets (towns) to guide enterprises in catering, home economics and hairdressing in strictly implementing prevention and control measures, and to actively promote the resumption of work by enterprises that meet the "work guidelines."
《通知》指出，对具备复工复产条件的企业不得禁止开业，对企业复工复产中存在的“防疫物资缺乏” “员工无法进小区”“员工隔离无场所”“租金减免政策难以落实”等实际困难，要积极协调解决。
The Notice states that enterprises that meet the conditions for resumption of production may not be prohibited from opening operations, and that practical difficulties such as "lack of epidemic prevention materials," "inability of employees to enter the community," "isolation and no place for employees" and "difficulties in implementing the policy of rent relief" exist in the resumption of work.
对暂缓复工复产的企业，要做好宣传引导工作，主动向企业通报疫情防控最新政策和工作进展，并根据疫情形势变化及防控要求，进行前瞻研判，适时复工复产。
Enterprises that have suspended the resumption of work shall do a good job in publicity and guidance, inform enterprises of the latest policies and progress in the prevention and control of the epidemic, and make forward-looking judgment in light of the changing epidemiological situation and the requirements for prevention and control, and resume work at an appropriate time.
眼下，如何渡过难关有序复工，是家政行业及从业人员亟需解决的一道难题。
At present, how to get through the difficulties and get back to work in an orderly manner is an urgent problem for the domestic industry and employees.
01从“香饽饽”到流落街头2月中旬，五角场环岛治安派出所来了一个无处可去的女子。
From "hot bun" to the streets in mid-February, the Pentagon around the island police station came a nowhere to go.
经民警询问，该女子姓邓，在上海从事居家育婴服务，也就是人们口中的“月嫂”。
After police inquiry, the woman's surname Deng, engaged in home nursing services in Shanghai, which is known as the "sister-in-law."
月嫂可是家政岗位中的“香饽饽”，这位邓阿姨怎会落得流落街头？通过进一步询问，原来今年春节期间，邓阿姨原本的订单排得满满当当，她也就选择留在上海，没有回老家。
After further inquiries, Aunt Deng, who had a busy schedule of orders during the Spring Festival, chose to stay in Shanghai instead of returning home.
2月7日，她结束了上一单育婴服务，按照原计划，来到下一单的雇主家。
On 7 February, she ended her previous baby-care service and went to the next employer's house, as planned.
但仅过了三天，该雇主就找了个借口辞退了她。
But only three days later, the employer found an excuse to fire her.
邓阿姨自觉真实的原因可能是因为雇主看了她的身份证，知道她老家在湖北。
Aunt Deng's self-consciousness may be due to the fact that her employer read her ID card and knew that her hometown was in Hubei Province.
虽然无奈，但邓阿姨也能理解，其他已经接好的订单随后也纷纷被取消。
Although helpless, but Aunt Deng can also understand, other has been connected to the order has also been canceled.
就这样邓阿姨一时找不到住处，“旅馆也不让住”。
In this way, Aunt Deng could not find a place to stay for a while.
而老家又是疫情重点地区，一时间无法返乡。
But the hometown is the epidemic key area, cannot return home for a time.
万般无奈之下，邓阿姨只能求助于警察。
In desperation, Aunt Deng can only turn to the police.
面对这一特殊情况，民警仔细核查了邓阿姨的相关信息，确认其自去年以来长期在上海工作，其间并没有回过湖北老家。
In the face of this special situation, the police carefully checked the information about Aunt Deng, confirmed that since last year, he has long worked in Shanghai, without returning to his hometown in Hubei.
为了保险起见，民警还是安排邓女士去医院做了健康检查，确认其无新冠肺炎疫情感染情况后，联系杨浦区民政局，安排邓女士在杨浦区救助站，临时安顿14天。
To be on the safe side, the Civil Police arranged for Ms. Deng to go to the hospital for a medical check-up to confirm that she had no case of nocturnal pneumonia.
当时，邓阿姨坚决表示，不回老家，一旦拿到工资，还有警方和医院提供的身体健康证明，她就能自食其力找地方居住了，到时候再找一份月嫂工作也不是难事。
At that time, aunt Deng firmly said that if she did not go home, once the salary, and the police and hospital provided by the physical health certificate, she was able to find a place to live, and then find a sister-in-law work.
2月25日，上海市家庭服务业行业协会（以下简称“上海市家协”）第一任会长陈锡珠通过新闻得知了邓阿姨的事情。
February 25, Shanghai Association of Family Service Industry (hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai Association") the first president of the news learned about Aunt Deng.
她第一时间将该情况与家协秘书处商量，又联系到市家协杨浦家政中心负责人，请他去派出所以及救助站了解情况。
She first discussed the situation with the Association secretariat, and then contacted the municipal association Yangpu Home Economics Center, asked him to go to the police station and help station for information.
“因为新闻只放到了她被送去救助站，我们也知道这种情况下，‘湖北籍’阿姨肯定会有难处，等她从救助站出来后，还是要找工作的，就是想帮帮她。
"Because the news only put her to the rescue station, we also know that in this case, 'Hubei nationality' aunt will certainly have difficulties, after she came out of the rescue, or to find a job, is to help her.
”陈锡珠告诉《新民周刊》。
Chen told Xinmin Weekly.
只可惜，邓阿姨已于前一天离开了救助站。
Unfortunately, Aunt Deng had left the station the day before.
该负责人立刻在家协的登记系统里比对邓阿姨的相关信息，确认了她确实是在家协会员单位登记过的家政人员。
The official immediately checked in with Aunt Deng's registration system and confirmed that she was indeed a domestic worker registered with the association.
“我们杨浦家政中心负责人通过手机联系上她之后，她一开始还不是很信任，称自己已经找到工作。
"After we contacted her on her cell phone at Yangpu Home Economics Center, she wasn't very trusting at first and said she had found a job.
如果我们是给她提供工作，她才愿意来见我们。
If we offer her a job, she will come to see us.
”陈锡珠回忆道，后来通过沟通，上述负责人慢慢取得了邓阿姨的信任。
"Later, through communication, the person in charge gained the trust of Aunt Deng," Chen recalls.
目前，杨浦家政中心为邓阿姨提供食宿，并对她进行家政培训。
At present, Yangpu Home Economics Center provides accommodation for Aunt Deng and trains her in home economics.
在陈锡珠看来，邓阿姨的意识是值得肯定的，“她都让雇主给她开了证明，证明了自己的活动轨迹，又在民政部门那里等于是隔离了10天”。
In Chen's view, Aunt Deng's awareness was positive. "She had her employer prove her track record, and she spent 10 days in isolation with the civil administration."
02一边防疫情，一边保刚需一方面，当下一些家庭对阿姨上门有所顾虑；另一方面，有些阿姨也对入户工作存在担心。
A border epidemic, on the one hand, just need to protect, now some families auntie to the door to worry; on the other hand, some aunts are also worried about entering the house.
为了解决这一问题，上海市家协副会长、浦东新区家协会长张琴英告诉记者，浦东新区家协早在2月初就紧急上线了一款微信小程序——“浦东新区家政员上门证服务平台”。
In order to solve this problem, Shanghai Association of Home Economics Vice President and Pudong New Area Association Director Zhang Qinying told reporters that Pudong New District Association in early February on the urgent line of a micro-small procedures - "Pudong New District Home Visitor Service Platform."
记者看到，该平台分为“雇主入口”“家政员入口”和“管理员入口”。
The reporter sees, this platform divides into "employer entrance", "housekeeper entrance" and "administrator entrance".
据张琴英介绍，这个小程序主要针对已经签了合同的家政员和雇主，双方均需登录完整填写相关信息，返沪人员还需提交已经隔离14天的证明、家政公司提供的务工证明、和雇主签订的用工合同，以及签署健康承诺书之后，系统会自动比对，由工作人员审核确定双方均无健康问题后，家协便开具“上门证”。
Zhang said the program is aimed at domestic workers and employers who have signed a contract. Both parties need to fill in the relevant information. Upon return to Shanghai, they will have to submit a certificate of isolation for 14 days, a certificate of employment with the employer and a health undertaking.
“现在各个小区管理也是非常严格的，这样也方便家政员进出小区。
"There is also very strict community management, which also facilitates the entry and exit of domestic workers into and out of the community.
我们的上门证上除了人员信息外，还具体到服务的地址。
Our door-to-door card in addition to personnel information, but also specific to the address of the service.
”张琴英表示。
"said Zhang.
截至3月1日，浦东新区家协共接到986个咨询电话，小程序后台已审核1312人的申请，通过104人。
As of March 1, the Pudong New District Association had received 986 calls, of which 1,312 applications had been approved backstage and 104 had passed.
据58同城数据显示，疫情稳定后，"服务人员"（包含家政类）的用工需求仅次于销售、生产加工类，高居各大行业的前三位。
& quot; service & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & quot; & quot; & quot; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & quot; & quot; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & quot; & quot; & quot
“目前来看，‘一老一小’仍然是家政服务的刚需。
"At the moment," one man and one woman "is still the demand for domestic service.
之前是居家养老的需求大一点，但之后，随着企业逐渐复工，双职工家庭父母双双上班，小孩在家里上网课，如果没有老人可以来照顾的话，对育儿嫂的需求也会有所回升。
There was a greater need for old-age care at home, but then, as businesses return to work, parents of dual-earner families go to work, children go online at home, and there will be an upturn in demand for child-rearing if there are no elderly people to look after.
”张琴英表示，浦东家协是号召家政员在疫情期间只服务单一客户，不要共享，“应该解决最困难的刚需，打扫卫生这种就让雇主尽量自己克服”。
Mr Cheung said Pudong was calling on domestic workers to serve only a single customer during the outbreak, not to share it. "The most difficult needs should be addressed, and cleaning up should be done by employers themselves," she said.
但事实上，家长们的心理也很矛盾的——育儿嫂真的回来了，不放心。
But in fact, the parents' psychology is also very contradictory - the child-raising sister-in-law really came back, not at ease.
至少得隔离14天吧？但14天后疫情是什么情况，谁也说不准。
At least 14 days of quarantining? But what happened 14 days later, no one knows for sure.
这一矛盾也是当下一线城市家庭的缩影。
This contradiction is now the epitome of the first-tier urban family.
疫情未发生前，育儿嫂之于双职工家庭而言，几乎是"标配"。
Before the outbreak, sister-in-law was almost & quot; & quot; standard & quot; with dual-earner families.
然而，春节和疫情同时到来，明显的"刚需"，又变得"不敢有需"。
However, Spring Festival and the epidemic came at the same time as AT & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot;
因此，上海市家协从防疫之初，就明确了“防疫情”和“保刚需”这两个目标。
Therefore, from the beginning of the epidemic prevention, Shanghai Jiaxiao clarified the "epidemic prevention situation" and "Baogang needs" these two goals.
早在1月27日就成立了上海家政防疫领导小组和联络组，并陆续下发了各种指导性文件。
As early as January 27, the Shanghai Leading Group and Liaison Group on Home economics and epidemic prevention were set up and issued various guiding documents.
市家协督促家政服务机构开展信息登记工作，要求企业填写从业人员信息表，包括在沪人员和返沪人员，严格实行“每日一报”制度，落实企业“管好人”的责任，对于未如实上报或瞒报或不报上岗的情况，企业依法承担责任。
The Association urges domestic service organizations to carry out information registration, and enterprises are required to fill out employee information forms, including those in Shanghai and Shanghai, strictly implement the "daily report" system, fulfill the responsibility of "good management" of enterprises, and take legal responsibility for failure to report or underreport or fail to report their posts.
“原则上，我们建议离沪返乡家政服务员在本市‘重大突发公共卫生事件一级响应’没有解除前，暂缓回沪。
"In principle, we recommend suspending the return to Shanghai until the 'major public health emergency first-level response' in Shanghai is resolved.
所有来沪返沪的家政服务人员严格落实 14 天隔离观察无疑似症状才可上岗。
All the domestic workers who come back to Shanghai to strictly implement the 14-day isolation observation can no doubt be symptoms of the onboarding.
”陈锡珠表示，家政服务机构和家政服务人员根据实际情况选择隔离方式——单位有隔离条件的，实施单位隔离；有居所的，实施居家隔离；无居住条件的，加强劝返、暂缓来沪，若已经抵沪的，到地区提供的集中隔离点进行健康观察。
Chen said domestic service agencies and domestic service workers chose to segregate them according to their actual situations.Units with isolated units should be segregated; those with residential conditions should be separated at home; those without residential conditions should strengthen measures to encourage them to come back to Shanghai and should they have already arrived in Shanghai, they should pay attention to the centralized quarantine points provided by the district.
据上海市家协要求，家政服务机构要积极协调保障刚需用户家庭，以春节期间留沪的家政服务人员为基本队伍，合理调配，优先考虑家庭养老服务刚性需求。
According to the Shanghai Association of Home Economics, domestic service organizations should coordinate actively to protect the families of newly-needed users, taking the domestic service staff staying in Shanghai during the Spring Festival as the basic team, and allocate them rationally, giving priority to the rigid demand of family pension services.
03加快家政从业者的员工制管理据上海市家协会长张丽丽介绍，整个疫情防控期间，上海50多万家政从业人员中，留沪人员占到46%，约23万人。
According to Zhang Lili, president of the Shanghai Family Association, 46 percent of the more than 500,000 domestic workers in Shanghai remained in Shanghai during the period of epidemic prevention and control, about 230,000 of them were employed in Shanghai.
截至 2 月 20 日，市家协现有 510 家会员单位中，累计申报复工企业 58 家，复工率为 11.31%。
As of February 20, the Association now has a total of 58 reinstated enterprises out of 510 members, with a return-to-work rate of 11.31%.
目前，家政行业复工主要还是受限于客观的交通通行、门店开放、居民社区进入等情况。
At present, the resumption of domestic work is mainly limited by objective traffic access, open stores, residential community access, and so on.
“部分复工企业以网上业务为主，由于入户服务量骤减，开始转型探索企业保洁消毒等。
"Some enterprises to return to the Internet-based business, as a result of a sharp drop in the number of services, began to explore enterprises cleaning disinfection.
”张丽丽表示，由于大部分家政员在沪无居住证，不符合严控疫情中的相关要求，从而直接影响了复工进度。
Zhang said most domestic workers did not have residence permits in Shanghai and did not meet the requirements of a strict outbreak of the disease, which directly affected the resumption of work.
不过，随着疫情的逐步控制，预测复工率为：2 月 20 日至 3 月 15 日的复工率保守预计在 20%左右。
However, with the progressive containment of the epidemic, the projected rate of return to work is conservatively estimated at around 20 per cent from 20 February to 15 March.
3月 16 日至 4 月 30 日，力争复工率达到60%。
Between 16 March and 30 April, efforts were made to restore the work force to 60 per cent.
如疫情解除，所有限制缓解，预计在两周左右将迎来行业全面复工，复工率可达到80%左右。
If the outbreak is lifted and all restrictions eased, full-scale reactivation of the industry is expected in about two weeks, with a return to work rate of around 80 per cent.
家政服务业是关系到千家万户的基础产业，以上海为例，据调查，上海800多万个家庭中，有超过三分之一的家庭正在使用或有家政服务需求。
In Shanghai, for example, more than one-third of the more than 8 million households in Shanghai are using or in need of domestic services, according to the survey.
今年5月1日就要正式实施的《上海市家政服务条例》中，明确鼓励发展员工制家政服务机构，依法与家政服务人员签订劳动合同或服务协议，缴纳城镇职工社保，并定期开展服务技能、安全、卫生等各方面培训，建立服务质量跟踪制度。
The Shanghai Regulations on Domestic Service, which will come into force on May 1 this year, explicitly encourage the development of domestic service institutions for employees, conclude labor contracts or service agreements with domestic service workers, pay social security contributions to urban workers, provide regular training in service skills, safety and hygiene, and establish a quality-of-service tracking system.
“此次疫情也充分反映了家政行业的特殊性，对于那些‘个体户’性质的家政人员，我们应当尽可能引导他们挂靠正规的家政机构。
"The epidemic also fully reflects the special nature of the domestic sector, for those 'self-employed' domestic workers, we should try to guide them to the formal domestic institutions.
对于雇主家庭，也希望她们能提高健康安全意识，从正规的家庭服务机构雇佣家政员，这样各方面才能更有保障。
Employers' families are also expected to increase their awareness of health and safety and to hire domestic workers from formal family services so that they can be more secure.
”上海市妇联副主席、新闻发言人翁文磊在接受《新民周刊》采访时表示，“无论是马上要实施的《上海市家政服务条例》，还是去年国务院提出的‘促进家政服务业提质扩容36条’都是希望家政行业能够尽快走向员工制管理。
"Both the upcoming implementation of the Shanghai Domestic Service Regulations and the State Council's proposal last year to" promote the upgrading and upgrading of the domestic service sector 36, "said Weng Wenlei, vice president of the Shanghai Women's Federation and a press spokesman, in an interview with Xinmin Weekly.
”张丽丽表示，根据接下来企业复工与返沪家政员的增加，在最新发布的《家政服务业复工复产新冠肺炎疫情防控工作指引》中，市家协对防疫要求作出明确规定，家政企业必须做到“四个100%”，即上岗人员100%戴口罩、100%测量体温、100%健康登记、经营场所100%消毒。
According to the new Guidelines on Prevention and Control of Resumption of Work-related Crowd Pneumonia in Domestic Service Industry, the Association clearly stipulated that domestic workers must wear 100 per cent masks, 100 per cent body temperature, 100 per cent health registration and 100 per cent disinfection of their premises, according to the latest Guidelines on Prevention and Control of New Crown Pneumonia.
复工家政企业须配合区、街道（镇）及相关防疫部门的指导监督。
Returned domestic enterprises shall cooperate with the guidance and supervision of the district, street (town) and epidemic prevention departments.
家政企业安排家政员上岗，须掌握其健康情况和近期个人行程。
Domestic workers are placed in domestic service and have access to information on their health and recent personal itineraries.
返沪家政服务员需14天隔离观察无异常后，方可安排上岗。
Returning to Shanghai domestic service workers need 14 days isolation observation after no abnormal, can be arranged to work.
鼓励家政企业对外公示家政员隔离信息，主动接受社会监督。
Domestic enterprises are encouraged to disseminate information on the separation of domestic workers and to take the initiative to accept social supervision.
发现发热、呼吸道症状者，应立即采取果断措施并上报。
Those who find fever and respiratory symptoms should take prompt and decisive measures and report them.
家政服务员每天早晚各量一次体温，做好记录；出门及工作时，戴好口罩；自备分装瓶，装好消毒液，做好必要消毒工作；进入用户家门时在门外换鞋或穿上鞋套，用准备好的分装瓶在门把手上进行消毒后再进门。
Every morning and evening, the housekeeper takes his temperature and keeps a proper record of his temperature. When he goes out and works, he wears a mask. When he enters the house, he changes his shoes outside the door or puts on a shoe cover.
进门后采用七步洗手法清洗双手，做好用户家庭室内通风、消毒等工作。
After entering the door with seven steps washing hands, do a good job of indoor ventilation, disinfection and so on.
家政服务员与用户沟通时，应尽量保持一米左右的距离，与用户家庭用餐，实行分餐制。
When communicating with users, housekeepers should try to maintain a distance of about one meter, eat with the user's family, the implementation of a separate meal system.
家政服务员应提醒用户测量体温并观察健康状况，若发现用户有发热、咳嗽等症状应及时停止服务，并第一时间告知家政企业。
The housekeeper should remind the user to measure his temperature and observe his health condition. If he finds any symptoms, such as fever and cough, he should stop the service in time and inform the domestic enterprise immediately.
家政服务员在乘坐公共交通工具时，一定要做好自我防护。
Domestic workers must protect themselves when travelling on public transport.
