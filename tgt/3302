张维/法制日报连日来引发舆论关注的刘文雄医生在家猝死未被认定工伤事件，近日有了最终结果。
Zhang Wei / the rule of law daily in recent days attracted public attention Dr. Liu Wenxiong sudden death at home was not recognized as an industrial accident incident, recently had the final result.
3月7日，湖北省仙桃市人社局推翻了之前不予认定工伤的决定，重新作出如下决定：刘文雄为在防疫备勤过程中突发疾病经抢救无效死亡，予以认定为工伤。
March 7, the Hubei Province Xiantao Municipal People's Bureau overturned the previous decision not to recognize industrial injuries, re-made the following decision: Liu Wenxiong in the course of epidemic prevention in the course of rescue invalid death, be recognized as industrial injury.
《法制日报》记者获悉，在这一变化的背后，是仙桃市人民政府于3月6日作出的行政复议决定：撤销仙桃市人社局作出的《不予认定工伤决定书》，并责令人社局在60日内重新作出决定。
A reporter from the Legal Daily said that behind the change was the decision of the Xiantao Municipal People's Government on March 6 to annul the Decision on Non-Determination of Work-related Injury issued by the Xiantao Municipal People's Bureau and ordered the bureau to make a new decision within 60 days.
而仙桃市司法局正是仙桃市政府的行政复议机构。
And Xiantao City Department of Justice is the administrative review body of the city government.
家人：为抗击肺炎疫情牺牲刘文雄是湖北省仙桃市三伏潭镇卫生院的一名门诊内科医生。
Family: Liu Wenxiong is an out-patient physician at Sanvuotan Town Health Center in Xiantao, Hubei Province.
在这场抗疫的全民战争中，作为医护人员又身处“重灾区”的他，自然是无可争议的逆行者。
In this civil war against the epidemic, as a medical staff in the "disaster area" he is naturally the indisputable inverse.
但还没有等到最终胜利，这位1970年出生的医生，就离开了这个世界。
But the doctor, born in 1970, left the world without waiting for the final victory.
死亡来得太突然，谁也没有想到，2月12日他下班后，就再没能见到同事们。
Death came so suddenly that no one expected to see his colleagues again after work on February 12th.
2月13日凌晨，他出现了胸痛、气喘等症状，虽经急救仍然不幸离世。
In the early morning hours of 13 February, he developed chest pain, asthma and other symptoms, and unfortunately died after first aid.
《居民死亡医学证明（推断）书》显示的诊断死亡原因为“急性心肌梗死”。
The Diagnostic Causes of Death are "Acute Myocardial Infarction," as shown in the Medical Certificate of Resident Deaths (Extrapolation).
离开的时间是在非工作时间，离开的地点是在家里，但在家人眼中，刘文雄是为抗击新冠肺炎疫情牺牲，应当被认定为工伤。
The time of departure is not working hours, the place of departure is at home, but in the eyes of the family, Liu Wenxiong is fighting the outbreak of pneumonia in the New Crown, should be recognized as industrial injury.
“虽然不是牺牲在工作时间和工作场所，但这段时期他的工作时间及工作场所已延及居家，符合《工伤保险条例》相关规定的认定条件。
"Although not at the expense of working hours and the workplace, his working hours and workplace have been extended to his home during this period, meeting the relevant requirements of the Industrial Injuries Insurance Ordinance.
”刘文雄的家人说。
"said Liu's family.
在这个没有假期的春节，他们看到了刘文雄仍在加班，即使回到家，在家都有电话接诊等工作。
On this holiday-free Spring Festival, they see Liu Wenxiong is still working overtime, even when they return home, there are telephone reception at home and so on.
事实上，仙桃市卫健委1月22日发布了紧急通知，要求各医疗卫生单位“全面启动战时值班备勤机制，全体人员取消春节休假，按作息时间正常上班，严格落实24小时值班值守制度”。
In fact, Xiantao Health Committee issued an emergency notice on January 22, requesting all medical and health units to "fully activate the wartime duty standby mechanism, all personnel canceled Spring Festival holidays, according to the normal work hours, strictly implement the 24-hour duty system."
此外，刘文雄的家人认为，也不排除刘文雄具有因感染新冠肺炎死亡的极大可能性，应考虑适用人力资源和社会保障部、财政部、国家卫生健康委员会下发的《关于因履行工作职责感染新型冠状病毒肺炎的医护及相关工作人员有关保障问题的通知》。
In addition, family members of Liu Wenxiong believe that Liu Wenxiong has a great chance of dying from pneumonia in the New Coronavirus. They should consider applying the Notice issued by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the Ministry of Finance and the State Council for Health and Welfare on the protection of medical personnel and related workers infected with the new coronavirus pneumonia due to the discharge of their duties.
刘文雄生前所在单位——三伏潭镇卫生院也认为，刘文雄是在疫情防控“战时状态”期间死亡，不应机械认定工作时间及工作地点，或机械理解法律条款。
Liu Wenxiong's unit - Sanfu Tam Town Health Institute also believed that Liu Wenxiong died during the epidemic prevention and control "wartime state," should not automatically identify working hours and workplaces, or mechanical understanding of the legal provisions.
刘文雄的病发死亡系超时间超负荷在岗工作导致，应当认定为工伤。
The death of Liu Wenxiong is caused by overwork and should be regarded as industrial injury.
2月19日，刘文雄家属持相关材料前往仙桃市人社局，希望认定刘文雄为工伤。
February 19, Liu Wenxiong's family members with related materials to the Xiantao Municipal People's Bureau, hoping to identify Liu Wenxiong as an industrial injury.
人社局：病亡情形不符合法定条件不过，仙桃市人社局于第二天即出具的《不予认定工伤决定书》，却给出了不同的结论。
People's Social Bureau: the circumstances of death and injury do not meet the legal conditions. However, the following day, the Social Bureau of Xiantao City issued the "decision not to recognize the work-related injuries," but gave a different conclusion.
因何不予认定？仙桃市人社局的理由是，刘文雄生前一段时间以来，并未承担一线防疫值班任务，工作时间相对固定、上下班规律，刘文雄突发疾病的时间是凌晨，地点是自己家中，不符合在工作时间和工作场所内，因工作原因受到事故伤害应当认定工伤的情形；此外，心肌梗死亦不属于规定的职业病范畴。
The reason is that Liu Wenxiong did not undertake the duty of first-line epidemic prevention for some time before his death, the working hours are relatively fixed and regular. The sudden illness of Liu Wenxiong occurred in the early hours of the morning at home.
因此，刘文雄的死亡不适用《工伤保险条例》第十四条规定。
Therefore, the death of Liu Wenxiong is not covered by Article 14 of the Industrial Injuries Insurance Regulations.
刘文雄凌晨在其家中突发疾病，显然不是在从事工作过程当中突发疾病，亦不符合“工作时间和工作岗位”的法定认定条件，因此刘文雄突发疾病死亡不属于《工伤保险条例》第十五条规定的应当认定视同工伤的情形。
Liu Wenxiong's sudden illness in his home in the early hours of the morning is clearly not a sudden illness in the course of his work and does not meet the legal requirements for recognition of "working hours and jobs." Therefore, Liu Wenxiong's sudden illness death is not considered as an injury under Article 15 of the Work Injury Insurance Regulations.
“虽然刘文雄作为医护人员中的一员，是当前疫情下最美丽的逆行者，其职业精神值得我们每个人尊重，不幸病逝亦令人痛心惋惜。
"Although Liu Wenxiong as one of the medical personnel, is the most beautiful under the current epidemic, its professionalism deserves the respect of all of us, unfortunate death is also sad regret.
但作为行政机关，依法行政是职责所系，因其病亡情形不符合上述应当认定工伤的法定条件，据此作出不予认定工伤决定。
However, as an administrative organ, administration by law is the responsibility of the system, because its illness and death do not meet the above-mentioned statutory conditions should be recognized industrial injury decision made accordingly.
”仙桃市人社局认为，上述认定事实清楚、证据确凿、适用法律依据正确。
"Xiantao Municipal People's Bureau believes that the above-mentioned findings of fact clear, well-founded, correct legal basis.
政府：不应机械界定工作时间工作岗位这份《不予认定工伤决定书》同时给出的救济渠道，给了刘文雄家人新的希望。
The government: Should not mechanically define the work hours of the "non-determination of work-related injuries decision" at the same time, the relief channels, give Liu Wenxiong family new hope.
文中指出，对工伤认定决定不服的，可自接到决定书之日起60日内向仙桃市人民政府或湖北省人力资源和社会保障厅申请行政复议，或在六个月内直接向仙桃市人民法院提起行政诉讼。
The article points out that those who are dissatisfied with the decision may apply to the Xiantao Municipal People's Government or the Hubei Provincial Human Resources and Social Security Office for administrative review within 60 days from the date of receiving the written decision, or file an administrative lawsuit directly with the Xiantao Municipal People's Court within six months.
2月27日，刘文雄生前所在单位——三伏潭镇卫生院向仙桃市人民政府申请复议，仙桃市司法局作为仙桃市政府的行政复议机构，于当日正式受理了此案，刘文雄的家属以第三人身份参与。
On February 27, Liu Wenxiong's unit - Sanfutan Town Health Center to Xiantao City People's Government for reconsideration, Xiantao City Judicial Bureau, as the administrative review body of the Xiantao City government, formally accepted the case on the same day, Liu Wenxiong's family participated as a third person.
而随着这次行政复议，刘文雄生前的抗疫工作量也进一步浮出水面。
With this administrative review, Liu Wenxiong's anti-epidemic workload further surfaced.
仙桃市政府查明，1月24日，三伏潭镇卫生院成立发热门诊专家指导组，刘文雄担任副组长并负责日常工作，除本职工作外还参与发热病人的诊治工作。
The city government found out that on January 24, Sanfutan Town Health Center set up a fever clinic expert guidance group, Liu Wenxiong as vice-chairman and in charge of daily work, in addition to their job, also participate in the diagnosis and treatment of febrile patients.
1月12日至2月12日，刘文雄共诊治内科门诊病人3506人次，其中一般发热病人670人次。
From January 12 to February 12, Liu Wenxiong treated a total of 3,506 outpatient visits, including 670 general fever cases.
防疫期间，医院还将刘文雄电话号码在发热门诊对外公布，刘文雄确实存在休息时间通过电话、微信接受病人问诊的情况。
During the epidemic prevention period, the hospital will Liu Wenxiong telephone number in the fever clinic announced, Liu Wenxiong do have rest time through the telephone, micro-letter patient consultation.
值得注意的是，仙桃市政府还认定了刘文雄带病上班的事实：2017年5月8日，刘文雄因扩张性心肌病和高血压三期等疾病在仙桃市第一人民医院住院7日。
It is worth noting that the city government also acknowledged the fact that Liu Wenxiong had gone to work with an illness: On May 8, 2017, Liu Wenxiong was hospitalized at the First People's Hospital of Xiantao City for seven days for dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertension.
2020年1月30日因右胸疼痛，并伴随胸闷、气喘等症状，由所在医院派车送至仙桃第一人民医院检查，检查回来后，刘文雄一直带病坚持正常上班，直到突发疾病去世。
On 30 January 2020, due to pain in his right chest accompanied by chest tightness and wheezing, he was sent by his hospital to the Peach First People's Hospital for examination.
仙桃市政府认为，在重大突发公共卫生事件一级响应背景下，三伏潭镇卫生院要求其所有医务人员24小时待命的备勤状态，同时将医生手机号码公示于发热门诊，有利于患者问诊落实，刘文雄生前下班后确实存在通过电话接诊的例证。
The city government believes that in the context of a major public health emergency first-level response, Sanvuotan Town Health Center requires all its medical staff to be on 24-hour standby, and that posting a doctor's cell phone number on a fever clinic facilitates patient consultation.
刘文雄1月12日至2月12日共诊治3506人次，参与了防疫工作，虽然死亡时间是13日凌晨，但发病时间是在12日下班后，应综合考虑疫情期间的工作情形，可以认定其死亡属在工作时间、工作岗位上突发疾病经抢救无效死亡的情形，符合《工伤保险条例》第十五条第一款第（一）项“视同工伤”的情形。
From January 12 to February 12, Liu Wenxiong attended 3,506 consultations and took part in epidemic prevention work. Although his death occurred in the early hours of the 13th morning, he should take into account the working conditions during the epidemic period.
“刘文雄的工伤认定应综合考虑抗疫特殊时期的工作情形，不应机械的界定‘工作时间’和‘工作岗位’。
"Liu Wenxiong's identification of work-related injuries should take into account the special period of anti-epidemic work situation, should not automatically define 'working hours' and 'jobs'.
”《仙桃市人民政府行政复议决定书》说。
"Xiantao City People's Government Administrative Review Decision" said.
仙桃市政府撤销了仙桃市人社局此前作出的《不予认定工伤决定书》，并责令其在60日内重新作出决定。
The city government revoked the previous decision of the Xiantao Municipal People's Association not to recognize an industrial injury decision, and ordered it to make a new decision within 60 days.
3月7日，仙桃市人社局作出决定，对刘文雄在防疫备勤过程中突发疾病经抢救无效死亡，予以认定（或视同）为工伤。
March 7, the Xiantao Municipal People's Bureau made a decision, Liu Wenxiong in the course of epidemic prevention in the course of rescue invalid death, recognition (or as if) as an industrial injury.
“事情终于尘埃落定，希望可以告慰父亲的在天之灵，也请大家放心。
"Things finally settled down, I hope to comfort my father's spirit, also please rest assured.
”刘文雄儿子刘航在朋友圈发文说。
