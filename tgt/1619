点击上方物质生活参考加星标！物质生活参考作者：赵小薇来源：物质生活参考（ID：wzshck）上周，物质生活参考推送了《超长期相处，被父母“逼疯”的年轻人》，许多读者看后表示：请关注一下长期带娃的父母，我们也快被逼疯了。
2007-9-19 15: 55 [hide] The Material Life Reference (ID: wzshck) Last week, the Material Life Reference was promoted to Super-Long-Destiny, Young Men Driven by Their Parents, and many readers looked at it and said, Look out for parents who have been with their babies for a long time.
好的⬇️⬇️⬇️每天清晨5点，肖琳都会被女儿吭哧吭哧的哼唧声吵醒。
A good quotient to turn up a quizzical chirp every morning at 5: 00 a.m. Shaolin would be awakened by her daughter.
一般情况下，她会毫不犹豫地摸黑塞过去一堆零食，让一岁半的娃坐在夜色中咀嚼，以此为自己争取“再睡一会儿”的宝贵机会。
Normally, she would not hesitate to tuck in a pile of snacks and let a one-and-a-half-year-old baby sit in the dark and chew it as a valuable opportunity to "sleep again."
“不试试都不知道自己底线有多低。
"I don't know how low my bottom line is without trying.
”她说，一个月来，自己带着俩娃居家办公，所谓的责任感自尊心，早已被鸡飞狗跳的生活模式消磨殆尽。
For a month, she says, her so-called sense of self-esteem, with her two babies working from home, has been worn down by the way things have gone.
至于生存状态，“说生无可恋显得有点儿矫情了，”肖琳说，“难度相当于三年高考五年模拟吧，永远甭想闲着，一直要升级打怪。
As for the state of existence, "It seems a little pretentious to say there is nothing to love about life," said Shaolin.
” 难以制服的“人类幼崽”带娃升级为“HARD”模式，原本不在肖琳预计之内。
The unruly "human cub" upgrade to "HARD" mode was not part of Shaolin's projections.
疫情排山倒海而来，公婆出于安全考虑未能及时回到上海，以往婆婆带娃的模式临时改为小两口带娃。
Outbreak of mountains and mountains, parents-in-law due to safety considerations did not return to Shanghai, the old model of mother-in-law to bring baby temporary change.
情况很快升级：军人身份的爱人节后即复工，而肖琳所在公司则安排员工在家办公。
Things quickly escalated: military lovers returned to work after the holiday, while Shawn's company arranged for employees to work from home.
二娃母亲随即陷入水深火热之中。
Then Eva's mother was in deep trouble.
在肖琳眼中，四岁的儿子和一岁半的女儿，尚处于 “人类幼崽”阶段：难以预测，难以制服。
In Shaolin's eyes, her four-year-old son and one-and-a-half-year-old daughter are in the "human cub" stage: unpredictable and difficult to subdue.
但二者总有不同，一般来说，女儿的主要示威方式是大声哭闹，四岁的儿子则体现出人类文明的进步，学会了用语言表达。
But there is always a difference. Generally speaking, the daughter's main way of demonstrating is to cry loudly, while the four-year-old son embodies the progress of human civilization and has learned to use language.
每天午休，当老母亲好不容易哄睡了老二，终于打开笔记本，准备推进一下ppt，还在自己房间看动画片的老大就不时进来晃一下，问“一个小问题”。
Every day, when the old mother hard to coax the second, finally opened the notebook, ready to push the ppt, but also in his room to see animation boss came in from time to time, ask "a small problem."
至于问题内容，有时是听到外面一个奇怪的声音问问是个啥，有时是想吃好吃的问问能不能吃，当然更多的是，“妈妈你在写什么你要写多久你什么时候陪我玩儿”。
As for the content of the question, there is sometimes a strange outside voice asking what it is, sometimes asking if you can eat it or not, and, of course, more often than not, "Mom, how long are you writing what you want to write about and when are you playing with me?"
“相当于你写东西的时候旁边有一只猫，一直站在你桌子旁边问你几点下班。
"" There's a cat next to you when you're writing, standing at your desk and asking what time it's time to leave.
”同样深受人类幼崽之苦的“奶爸”王新这样解释。
"Wang Xin, the" wet father, "who also suffers from human cubs, explains.
猫一样的大儿子虽然唐僧但总还能以礼相待，还不会讲话的小儿子则很难晓之以理。
Although the cat-like son is still able to treat the Tang Priest politely, but can not speak to the younger son is difficult to understand.
“他热爱一切圆形的东西，见到所有圆形的东西都想要，盘子和碗已经摔破了N个了。
"He loved everything round, wanted everything round, and had broken N plates and bowls.
”王新长叹一口气，圆形爱好者最近看上了他的唱片，文艺中年的音乐梦被执拗的人类幼崽掰得稀碎。
"Wang heaved a sigh and rounded enthusiasts recently fell in love with his recordings, with middle-aged literary dreams shattered by stubborn human cubs.
狂热的圆形物体爱好者“我真没想到他比我还爱唱片！”王同学非常阿Q地用遗传基因自我安慰，甚至联想起“晴雯撕扇”的美妙情节。
"I didn't think he loved records more than I do," said Wang, who consoles himself with genetic genes and even conjures up the wonderful plot of Vivien's Fan.
但更多人面对的“幼崽”并无特殊喜好，因而应对手段常规且枯燥。
But more people are facing "cubs" who have no special preferences, so coping strategies are routine and boring.
“会唱的歌儿都唱了，会讲的故事都讲了，想吃的东西都吃了，超级飞侠奥特曼的台词我都会背了。
"I have sung all the songs I can sing, told all my stories, eaten everything I wanted to eat, and recited the lines of Superman Altman.
”每天与儿子相伴的张力感到脑细胞已经被耗尽，满脑子只有循环播放的儿歌：“奶奶喂了两只鸡呀，大公鸡和大母鸡。
The tension that accompanies a son every day feels that his brain cells are used up and that all he can think of is a recurring refrain: "Grandma feeds two chickens, the cock and the hen.
”被学龄儿童“逼疯”的悲惨中年梁燕在朋友圈晒了一张摞在一起的课本截图，粗略一看七八本。
The miserable middle-aged Liang Yan, who was "driven mad" by school-age children, made a cursory reading of seven or eight of the books piled up in a circle of friends.
配图说：这是工作之余要带孩子学的课程。
This is a course to take your kids with you after work, says Diagram.
没想到有生之年我成了全科辅导老师，还是没有辅导费的那种。
I did not expect to be a general tutor in my lifetime, or there was no tutoring fee.
另一条朋友圈，她总结了辅导一年级儿子学习的日常：起床-早饭-写作业-心平气和地讲-略有点不耐烦地讲-强忍胸中怒火地讲-午饭-午休-爆发-和解-晚饭-吭哧瘪肚把作业讲完-睡觉。
Another circle of friends, she summed up the daily routine of tutoring her first-year son to learn: getting up - breakfast - homework - speaking calmly - speaking with a little impatience - forcing - lunch - lunch break - eruption - reconciliation - dinner - squelching homework - sleep.
此间艰辛与波折她表示“不忍多说”，“除了‘亲生的’三个字，你很难找到理由平息怒火或者自我安慰。
It's hard to find any reason to calm anger or console yourself other than the words' own '.
”梁燕说。
'said Liang.
矛盾的重点在于：开学虽然延迟了，但是“停学不停课”的指示下，作业并没有减少。
The point of the contradiction is that, although the beginning of school has been delayed, but "suspension does not stop classes," the instructions, homework has not decreased.
每天早上一睁眼，梁燕都会颤抖着打开手机，记下各科老师的各项作业，按时间段布置下去之后，自己再开始远程办公。
Every morning when she opened her eyes, she would open her cell phone, write down the assignments of her teachers, arrange them in time, and start telecommuting herself.
与爱人一样，梁燕所在的单位原则上已经复工通勤。
Like her lover, Liang Yan's unit has returned to work in principle.
针对无人带娃的双职工家庭，各地出台的政策相似，即远程办公，或者“鼓励企业安排一名家长带薪居家看护”。
For dual-earner families, the policies are similar: telecommuting, or "encouraging companies to arrange for a parent to stay at home with pay."
夫妻俩协商后，居家带娃的责任落到梁燕身上。
After the husband and wife agreed, the responsibility of bringing babies to the family fell on Liang Yan.
于是，以往只在下班后发生的惨剧，如今成了贯穿全天的持续性项目。
As a result, what used to be a tragedy only after work is now an ongoing project throughout the day.
相对而言，刘西与女儿的相处大多数时间还算愉快。
In relative terms, Liu's relationship with her daughter has been relatively pleasant.
最近两次“炸裂”都发生在检查语文作业过程中：组词题中，女儿在“脸”后面写下了“小白脸”；多音字组词题，“作”的答案写的是：“作死”。
The most recent two "explosions" occurred in the course of checking language assignments. In one group, the daughter wrote "Little White Face" after "Face"; the answer to the multiple-syllable word "do" was "to die."
刘西捧着作业本目瞪口呆。
Liuxi stared in his exercise book.
在此之前，她头疼的还是女儿上英语网课时东倒西歪、昏昏欲睡的状态，“没想到先折在了中文上。
Before that, she had a headache is her daughter on the English network class stagger, drowsy state, "I did not expect to fold in Chinese first.
”但更让她目瞪口呆的，是微信群里秀出天际的神奇家长，开学第一天，一位家长录了一条孩子在家举行开学典礼和升旗仪式的视频，同时配上慷慨激昂的文字：校服依然湛蓝！红领巾依然鲜红！***表示：一定按照学校安排和少先队员的标准要求自己！来自家长群的“表演”刘西说，她突然对“作”这个多音字，有了更直观的理解。
But what struck her the most was the magical parent who showed off the sky in a small group of letters. On the first day of school, a parent videotaped a child holding an opening ceremony and flag-raising ceremony at home, accompanied by an impassioned message: school uniform is still blue!
来自“猪队友”的神助攻对于很多人来说，戏精家长的杀伤力尚且有限，更大的伤害，往往来自身边的“猪队友”。
"Pig teammates" from the god of the attack for many people, drama parents are still limited, more harmful, often from the side of the "pig teammates."
由于父母和育儿嫂都被困在老家，李如和老公只能开启双人组队带双娃模式。
As the parents and the mother-in-law are trapped in the home, Li and her husband can only open a double team with double baby mode.
前几天，李如把小女儿哄睡的任务分配给队友，一下子觉得夜晚轻松很多。
A few days ago, Li Ru coax the younger daughter to sleep the task assigned to teammates, suddenly feel a lot easier at night.
昨晚女儿爬回她身边，不断问她：怪兽来了吗？怪兽来了吗？抓来队友询问，才知道，这几天哄睡的办法一直是：再不睡觉怪兽就来了！李如火冒三丈：教育孩子已经够我受的了，还得教育大人！因为平常很少带娃，队友的招数很快捉襟见肘，于是回归了最原始的套路：每天带娃室内踢球半小时。
Last night, my daughter crawled back to her and kept asking her: Has the monster come? Has the monster come? The way to sleep is always this: If you don't sleep any more, you've got to educate grown-ups!
目前的战绩是：上周踢碎了左边的花瓶，这周把右边对称的那只也踢破了。
The current record: Kicked the vase on the left last week and the symmetrical one on the right this week.
另一个简单粗暴的娱乐项目是“捉迷藏”，李如写了一半稿子出来一看，小女儿被藏进了脏衣篓。
Another simple, rude entertainment project was "hide-and-seek." Li Ru, who had written half of his manuscript, came out to find the little girl hidden in the basket.
“耗电大法”似乎是爸爸们带娃的最强大武器。
"Power-guzzling" seems to be the most powerful weapon dads use to bring their babies.
周末时，肖琳会把娃全部交给老公，自己躲进小屋赶PPT进度。
At the weekend, Shaolin would hand over all her babies to her husband and hide in the hut to catch the PPT progress.
屋外俨然一场热闹的小型运动会，短跑跳跃搬运翻滚以及背娃俯卧撑，或者是对着一面墙用switch打怪兽。
Outside, it was a lively mini-sport, with sprints, jumps, push-ups, or swinging monsters against a wall.
一般情况下，不到八点，小怪兽们就能电量耗尽，沉沉睡去。
Normally, before eight o'clock, little monsters can run out of electricity and go to sleep.
也有队友一直采取消极躲避态度。
There are also teammates who have been passive dodgers.
梁燕的老公每天下班后还要坐在车里“云办公”，不饿到万不得已绝不进屋，理由是“不想看到母子俩反目成仇的惨烈局面”。
Liang's husband also sits in the car "Cloud work" after work every day, not too hungry to enter the house, on the grounds that "do not want to see mother and son into each other's bitter situation.
夫妻俩为此大吵一架，胶着之中，儿子跳了出来，大声助威：现在是2-1！你们再打一架，谁厉害我就站在谁那边！不是对策的对策没有老人帮带、没有育儿嫂在职、只剩猪队友相助的日子，到底什么时候才能结束，被迫“打怪升级”的父母们至今难以预料。
In the middle of the quarrel, the son jumped out and shouted, It's 2-1! If you fight one more time, I'll be right there! The answer isn't When the game will end without the help of old people, the mothers-in-law, and their hog teammates.
许多人在艰难之中探索出一点另类生存之道。
Many people have found a way to survive in the midst of hardship.
一岁半的女儿见不得老母亲一门心思盯着手机，但如果同时做着一点别的什么事就还能体谅，于是肖琳每次刷微博的时候，都要一边刷一边撕纸；一边玩儿手机一边撕纸的“成果”实在没故事可讲时，张力会视频连线母亲，让奶奶在线“云带娃“。
One-and-a-half-year-olds can't see their mothers staring at their cell phones, but they can make allowances for doing something else at the same time. So, whenever Shaolin brushes her microblogging, she tears the paper while playing on her mobile phone.
一般来说，可以换来儿子一小时左右的非暴力时段；刘西要求女儿多背点古诗，最近背的一首是《送柴侍御》。
Generally speaking, in exchange for her son about an hour of non-violent time; Liu Xi asked her daughter to recite more ancient poetry, recently recite a "firewood and royal."
她并不指望女儿成为精通诗词的才女，“只要组词的时候别暴露女土匪气质就可以了”；也有弄巧成拙的时候。
She did not expect her daughter to become a talented woman versed in poetry, "as long as the group of words do not reveal brigandish temperament"; also self-defeating time.
面对儿子一次又一次地打断工作，肖琳恐吓说：老板随时要开视频会，如果有娃捣乱，看到一次扣一千，妈妈就没钱给你买玩具了！这一威胁十分有效。
In the face of her son interrupting work again and again, Shaolin threatened to hold a video-conference at any time. If anyone messes up and sees a thousand buckles at a time, Mom won't have enough money to buy you toys!
周末到来，当队友想给她送个苹果进屋时，儿子果断挡在门外：你一进去，我的乐高就没有了！梁燕则感受到了危机教育带来的成果。
When teammates tried to bring her an apple into the house over the weekend, my son stood in front of the door. Once you entered, my LEGO was gone! Liang felt the benefits of crisis education.
前两天，七岁的儿子突然说，妈妈，我生日的时候，你不要给我买礼物了，没有礼物我也觉得很幸福。
"The other day, my seven-year-old son suddenly said," Mom, on my birthday, don't buy me a present.
她问为什么，儿子说，因为可能到时候我们家就没钱花了。
She asked why, her son said, because we might not have enough money then.
还主动表示：妈妈，把我的压岁钱给你吧。
And volunteered: Mom, give you my lucky money.
真正让她觉得孩子从“小怪兽”变成“小天使”，是在知道爸爸对接的工作与湖北相关后，以往沉迷于手机游戏的儿子，很少再去抢队友的手机玩儿。
She really let her feel the child from "little monster" to "little angel," knowing that the father docking work related to Hubei, the past indulged in mobile games, rarely to rob teammates of mobile phones.
“你是在为国家做贡献，我支持你的。
"You are making a contribution to our country, and I support you.
”他说。
'he said.
