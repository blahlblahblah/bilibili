元宵节，滞留海外的武汉人没有回家。

开启更有意思的武汉！请点击上方优良better→点击右上角“...” → “设为星标 ”截至今日，新冠肺炎全国确诊人数超过三万人，死亡723人，数字远远超过2003年的非典。
Open a more interesting Wuhan! Click on the top right corner of the good news! Click on the top right corner to "set the star" As of today, there are more than 30,000 confirmed cases and 723 deaths nationwide, far more than the SARS epidemic in 2003.
疫情发生在春节，在这个对中国人而言意义深重的节日里，疫情带来的是分别、焦灼和泪水。
The outbreak occurred during the Spring Festival, a festival that meant so much to the Chinese people. It brought separation, anxiety and tears.
持续上升的数据让人对数字开始麻木。
The rising numbers are beginning to numb.
相较于数字，我会更担心去年秋天感冒的奶奶是否健康安全，听见母亲说头疼心慌到立马下楼买药，付款时看着支付宝里的余额一阵叹气，电梯里即使相隔一层口罩，我也害怕有病毒会钻进来。
I was more worried about the health and safety of Grandma, who had caught a cold last fall, than about the fact that my mother said she had a headache and rushed downstairs to buy medicine.
这是被困在宜昌家中的我的日常。
This is my daily life trapped in my home in Yichang.
但还有一些人，至今滞留在海外他乡，焦灼地等待着那一架神圣的飞机。
But still others, still stranded abroad, were anxiously waiting for the sacred plane.
今天是元宵节，这个本应阖家团聚的日子，对滞留在海外的武汉人来说，只是又一个茫然等待、手足无措的普通一天。
Today is the Lantern Festival, this should be the family reunion day, for Wuhan stranded overseas, is just another dazed waiting, helpless ordinary day.
在他们看来，回家的路从未如此曲折漫长，回家的愿望也从未如此强烈。
Never, in their eyes, had the road home been so long tortuous, nor had the desire to go home been so great.
以下，我记录了五个滞留在境外十多天的武汉人的经历。
Below, I recorded the experiences of five Wuhan people who stayed abroad for more than ten days.
我是个不做旅行计划的人，年末了，就想找个地方好好休息，看看书睡睡觉。
I'm a non-travel planner. At the end of the year, I want to find a place to rest and read and sleep.
我1月21抵达清迈，结果到达没两天，武汉封城了。
I arrived in Chiang Mai on January 21st, and only two days after my arrival, Wuhan closed the city.
原想大年三十下午回家，陪母亲吃饭，形势所逼，我只得从清迈辗转曼谷，只有那里有回国的包机。
I wanted to come home for dinner with my mother in the afternoon, so I had to transfer from Chiang Mai to Bangkok, where there are only chartered flights.
我在到达清迈三天后就开始考虑两个事情，住哪里？买口罩！不管去哪里每天都要去药店买几包口罩，我意识到应该多买。
Three days after arriving in Chiang Mai, I began to think about two things, where to live? Buy a mask! Everywhere I went to buy a few bags of masks, I realized I should buy more.
店员说不会再进货了，于是我买走了剩下的三包口罩，折合人民币1000元。
The clerk said it would not be restocked, so I bought the remaining three bags of masks, equivalent to 1,000 yuan.
25号上午，我正在休息，拒绝了酒店阿姨打扫卫生，她以为我不舒服，就告诉了大堂经理，大约两个小时后，来了一位全副武装的医生要求检查，问我最近有没有发病、服药，他问得很耐心很细致，这是一种负责任的行为，我完全可以理解。
On the morning of the 25th, when I was resting and turned down my aunt's cleaning, she told the lobby manager that about two hours later a heavily armed doctor came and asked me if I had had any recent illness or medication.
武汉封城后，我收到返程航班取消的邮件，因为箱子里带的都是夏天的衣服，于是我想到去海南三亚，从那里再回位于海口的另一个家。
Wuhan after the closure of the city, I received the return flight canceled mail, because the boxes are full of summer clothes, so I thought to go to Sanya, Hainan Province, from there back to the other home in Haikou.
那天中午，海口出台了拒绝湖北人入境的文件。
At noon that day, Haikou issued a denial of entry documents to Hubei people.
住的酒店马上到期，我迅速打开飞猪、去哪儿寻找住处，一些民宿老板见我是武汉号码直接拒绝，而他们，几乎都是国人。
The hotel is about to expire, I quickly opened the hog, where to find a place to live, some residential owners see I am Wuhan number directly refused, and they, almost all Chinese.
于是，我打开booking，开始寻找国外的房东，很快就找到了现在住的房子。
So I opened the bookings, began to search for foreign landlords, and quickly found the house I was living in.
到底回不回去，我挣扎了很久，不害怕是不可能的，万一回去遇到什么状况，破坏掉目前的平衡怎么办？在做决定那天，我一晚上都没睡着。
After all, I struggled for a long time without fear, but what if I went back and upset the current balance? I didn't fall asleep the night I made the decision.
我是81年的，亲身经历了九八年抗洪，非典时期被隔离在学校，这些记忆很深刻，但都没有这次这么特殊。
I am 81 years old, I experienced the flood in 1998, SARS was isolated in the school, these memories are very deep, but none of this so special.
出现了困难，找到一些组织大家更要团队协作去解决，然而很多人只在诽谤质疑，我很纳闷为什么对别人没有基本的信任呢？我真的感受到独立生存、过滤信息、主动寻求帮助是多么重要的能力，而我们的教育，似乎忘记了教大家怎么生活。
Difficulties have arisen, and we have found organizations where people need to work together more as a team to solve them, but many people only question defamation, and I wonder why there is no basic trust in others.I really feel how important it is to be independent, to filter information, to reach out for help, and our education seems to forget to teach people how to live.
23号我和老公到达巴黎，一出机场就被一些媒体围上来问，“你们为什么要来法国？”那一刻说实话我很生气，而后的经历让我的心情更加复杂。
23 My husband and I arrived in Paris, the airport was surrounded by a number of media asked, "Why do you want to come to France?" At that moment, I was very angry, and the subsequent experience made my mood more complicated.
因为疫情升级，29号返程航班取消，联系机场，客服电话一直打不通。
Due to the escalation of the epidemic, 29 return flights cancelled, contact the airport, customer service calls have been blocked.
通过线上我联系到了法航，说可以改签到2月6日，没过多久又通知整个2月都没有航班。
I contacted Air France on the line and said I could sign until Feb. 6, and it wasn't long before I was informed that there were no flights throughout February.
接着，我每天给大使馆外交官打电话，想寻求解决办法，得到的回应是“这都是意料之中的事，你不用每天来问，我们也没有接到消息，关注网站就行了。
Then I called embassy diplomats every day to try to find a solution, and I was told, "It's not unexpected. You don't have to ask every day.
”第三天开始对方显得不耐烦，也没有登记我们的信息。
"On the third day we began to appear impatient and did not register our messages.
当我得知可以包机回国时，我再一次打给英国大使馆，对方说英国会安排，愿意等可以等，但他们不保证，建议尽快自行回国。
When I learned that I could charter the plane to return home, I called the British Embassy again and was told that the British would arrange, be willing to wait, but they did not promise to return home as soon as possible.
当天，全国各地的机场依旧联系不到人。
Airports across the country remained inaccessible that day.
我每天接收到的信息都是不确定、不知道、别问我。
The information I receive every day is uncertain, I don't know, don't ask.
每天都在操心明天住哪里？什么时候能回去？我该联系谁？后来，我和老公达成一致——谁都不要问了，自己处理。
Everyday I worried about where to live tomorrow? When I could go back? Who should I contact? Later, my husband and I agreed not to ask - no one else to deal with it.
一个在日本的同学给了我一份回国攻略，29号我们抢到了从巴黎到上海的票，然后买了从上海到长沙的票，经停武汉，这是最好的路线。
A classmate in Japan gave me a strategy to return home, 29 we snatched a ticket from Paris to Shanghai, and then bought a ticket from Shanghai to Changsha, through stop Wuhan, this is the best route.
安排妥当之后，我们才稍微放松一些，在巴黎玩了两天。
After the arrangements were made, we relaxed a little and spent two days in Paris.
清场的卢浮宫，为了大家安全，我俩决定6点出门逛景点但很快，刚刚平复的心情又受到了来自现实的暴击。
Clearing the Louvre, for the sake of everyone's safety, we decided to go out at 6 o'clock scenic spots but soon, just recovered from the shock of reality.
2月3号回国那天，登机时空姐了解到我们来自武汉，为了不引起大家恐慌，检测体温后把我们安排在最后一排，在那之前的三排座椅都被撤掉，给我们单独拿了纸巾，厕所也是单独使用，并告诉我们之后可能不会有服务。
On the day of our return on February 3, the stewardess learned that we were from Wuhan and, in order not to cause panic, we were placed in the back row. Before that, the three rows of seats were removed, we were given separate paper towels, the toilet was used alone and we were told that services might not be available.
这时候上来一家五口人，其中一位大妈问后面为什么不能坐，空姐解释完后他们全家的情绪就爆炸了，开始质问谩骂工作人员，要求下飞机。
One of them asked why she could not sit down. When the flight attendant explained, the family exploded. They started to hurl insults at the staff and demand to get off the plane.
这样僵持了一个小时，乘务长不敢做决定，打电话给总部，回答是不想飞的人员自行下机，帮助改签，那一家五口才离开。
After an hour of stalemate, the flight attendant did not dare to make a decision. He telephoned the head office and replied that the person who did not want to fly had disembarked himself and helped to change the plane.
乘务长走过来，给我俩安排了餐食，把座位换到了靠窗的位置，告诉我们不要害怕，他在非典时期经历过无数这种事，他还说，“肯定会有乘客问，但我不会暴露你们的信息。
The steward came up, arranged meals for us, changed our seats to a window seat, told us not to be afraid, he had experienced so many of these things during SARS, and said, "There will certainly be passengers to ask, but I will not reveal your information.
”坐在前排的一个小女孩儿，拿了一盒巧克力过来安慰我。
A little girl in the front row came to comfort me with a box of chocolates.
小女孩的巧克力落地上海之后，例行检测没有问题，行李消毒之后，我们被带到东航相应的酒店隔离，时间是两天。
After the little girl's chocolate landed in Shanghai, there was no problem with the routine tests. After the luggage was disinfected, we were taken to the corresponding hotel in Donghai for two days.
但就在等待行李的那段空白时间，一个中年男人拿着手机，摄像头正对着我俩拍照，边拍边说，“看那俩是武汉的。
But while waiting for the luggage gap, a middle-aged man was holding a cell phone and a camera was flapping at us as he clapped.
”隔离证明这一切直到今天凌晨才结束，我终于回到了武昌家里，经过三环时外面的样子，就像以往凌晨三四点的武汉。
The isolation proved that it was not until early this morning that I finally returned to Wuchang's house and passed through the Third Ring Road as if it had been Wuhan at 3 or 4 a.m.
除夕那天，我和老公在法国一家快餐店吃了一包薯条，那就是我们的年夜饭，好在今天我终于回来了，赶上十五，冰箱里还有汤圆。
On New Year's Eve, my husband and I ate a bag of French fries at a French fast food restaurant. It was our New Year's Eve.
我的工作往返在武汉和泰国之间。
My job is between Wuhan and Thailand.
因为对曼谷很熟悉，有一些物资渠道，疫情爆发后，在确认家人健康后我主动决定留在这边，一是减少家里负担，二是回去也帮不上忙，也许滞留人员需要我的帮助，在这里做志愿者，我的作用更大。
Because Bangkok is very familiar with some of the material channels, after the outbreak of the outbreak, after confirming the health of my family, I voluntarily decided to stay here, one is to reduce the burden on the family, the other is not to help back, perhaps the stranded people need my help, here as volunteers, my role is even greater.
最近在协助处理曼谷滞留人员包机回国的事情，也常常充当司机和搬运工。
Recently, assistance has been provided for the repatriation of chartered personnel detained in Bangkok, often as drivers and porters.
和我一起的是一个河北女生，她一直在泰国工作，是这次工作的组织者。
With me was a Hebei schoolgirl who had been working in Thailand and was the organizer of the work.
我们有一个三百多人的群，用来收集大家的信息，发布航班动态，我的工作就是制表、反馈、回复，并关注国内国际实时发布的政策。
We have a group of more than three hundred people who collect information about everyone and post flight movements. My job is to tabulate, respond, and follow policies that are published in real time, nationally and internationally.
每日每夜我们都要处理大量重复的信息，三百多人，一人一句话，相同的问题反复在解释，大家情绪都不稳定，甚至还有人在群里造谣，质疑航空公司发国难财，我们作为中间的沟通者，不仅心力交瘁，还承受着很大的心理压力。
Every night and every day we deal with a great deal of repetitive information, 300 people, one person at a time, the same questions being repeatedly explained, the mood is unstable, and even people in the group rumors that the airline is not rich, we as intermediary communication, not only exhausted, but also under great psychological pressure.
现在群里分两类人，一是牵挂家里，在外经济负担重要回家的人，他们大多没有任何信息源，也不会主动去搜索过滤信息，像无头苍蝇一样惶恐，慌乱。
Now there are two kinds of people in the group, one is worried about the family, the economic burden of the important home, most of them do not have any source of information, do not actively search filter information, like headless flies, panic.
另一部分是早就做好打算不回去的人，这些人基本都租好了一个月的民宿别墅，相对淡定。
The other part is the long-planned not to go back, these people have basically rented a month of residential villa, relatively calm.
有个女生听说小F捐物资，扔了半箱行李帮他们装东西。
A girl heard about the donation of supplies from F and threw half a box of luggage to help them load things.
滞留在泰的国人已达上万，有上千是武汉人，所以这就产生另外一个现象，先来的害怕后来的带来病毒，这是一种很微妙的心理。
Tens of thousands of Chinese are stranded in Thailand, thousands of Wuhan people, so this gives rise to another phenomenon, first fear of the virus later, this is a very delicate psychological.
在这样的突发性灾难下，要接回海外滞留的疫区人员，有一套严格的流程。
In such a sudden disaster, to receive the overseas stranded epidemic area personnel, there is a strict set of procedures.
首先我们要帮大使馆收集有意愿回去的人员信息，提交给外交部批文，调度飞机，然后再确定派遣哪家航空公司，在此之前，还需获得泰汉双方的认可批准。
First we need to help the embassy collect information about people who want to go back, submit it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for approval, dispatch the plane, and then decide which airline to dispatch.
为了尽可能地降低经济损失，人数大于一百官方才会调度飞机，所以在这种情况下，如果不满100人报名，我们就会面对很多微辞和非议，我只想尽我能力做些事情，却没想到做一件好事竟那么难。
In order to minimize the economic losses, the number of people will be more than 100 before dispatching aircraft, so in this situation, if less than 100 people signed up, we will face a lot of criticism and criticism.
2月7日下午，群内130人搭乘包机安全到达武汉。
On the afternoon of February 7, 130 people from the group arrived safely in Wuhan on chartered flights.
因为要跟大量的供应商对接，常常是一会儿有包机和医疗物资，一会儿又没有或者物资不符合要求，我每天的心情都上上下下。
As I had to connect with a large number of suppliers, often with charter flights and medical supplies, while at other times there were no or inadequate supplies, my mood was going up and down every day.
而且，还有一点我想告诉大家，千万不要相信微商，他们口中的有大量口罩都是假的，现在情况是量越大越不可能。
What's more, I'd like to tell you, don't trust microquotients. A lot of masks in their mouths are fake. The bigger the quantity, the less likely.
很多人也通过群聊加我微信求助，他们非常不安，这些天一边帮助安慰别人，也一边担心自己，未来两个月我将没有收入。
A lot of people ask me for help by chatting and writing letters. They are very upset and they worry about themselves and I won't be making any money for the next two months.
等下周工作做完之后，我打算和团队一起商量接下来怎么办。
After I finish my work next week, I plan to discuss with my team what to do next.
我男朋友是英国人，这次和我们一起出来的还有他的三个朋友。
My boyfriend is an Englishman, and this time we came out with three of his friends.
当我们得知3月1号回国的希望都很渺茫，我们还得在外面漂一两个月的时候，我想到的第一件事是我的三只狗怎么办？1月14号我就把它们送到了宠物店，二十多天过去了，我交了一次费，16天，2900块钱，接下来要再交一个月，这是笔不小的开支。
When we learned that our chances of returning home on March 1st were slim and we had to spend a month or two outside, the first thing that came to mind was what to do with my three dogs.
出来这段时间，我们已经花了3万多人民币，现在每天我会去沙滩上坐坐，不要钱。
In the meantime, we've spent more than 30,000 yuan, and now I'm going to sit on the beach every day for no money.
不购物，不上馆子，吃饭都在街边小摊解决，想喝酒了就去便利店买，然后站在酒吧门口喝。
Instead of shopping, eating out, eating at street stalls, and when you feel like drinking, go to a convenience store and stand in front of the bar.
就这样，每天的日常支出控制在200元左右，毕竟现在我没有收入。
In this way, my daily expenses are limited to about 200 yuan. After all, I have no income now.
得知我们从中国来，他们说，那为病毒干杯吧。
They said, 'Let's drink to the virus.
有家不能回，回国也担心被感染，男朋友提出去他家住一段时间，那里也相对安全，正好我手上也有英国签证，于是我们买了从印尼转阿姆斯特丹，再到伦敦的机票，但他的家人也担心会被感染，所以说实话，我要是有选择我肯定回去。
My boyfriend offered to stay with him for a while, and it was relatively safe. I had a British visa, so we bought a plane ticket from Indonesia to Amsterdam to London, but his family also feared infection, so to tell the truth, I would definitely return if I had a choice.
经济上，我男朋友可以在伦敦打短工，而我却很尴尬，因为我是武汉人，而且我不知道疫情什么时候会结束，这让我没法找兼职，只能在线上找找教英语之类的活儿，没办法也必须创收。
Financially, my boyfriend can work part-time in London, but I'm embarrassed because I'm from Wuhan and I don't know when the epidemic will end.
今日漂在海上，向这片海默念：祈求大自然带走这场灾难。
Today, floating on the sea, meditation on this sea: pray to nature to take this disaster away.
这里面有一种很强烈的逃难的感觉，心里根本没底，还担心到达英国后被遣返，最近几天，我每天都在不停地刷各地的入境政策和官方消息。
There was a strong sense of flight, a deep sense of hopelessness, fear of deportation to the UK and, in recent days, I had been constantly brushing immigration policies and official information.
后来我去一家店买拖鞋，付款时我出示的卡片上有汉字，店员问我，“武汉人吗？”我下意识摇头说不是。
Later I went to a shop to buy slippers. When I paid, the card I showed had Chinese characters on it. The clerk asked me, "Is the Wuhan people?"
在库塔，路过一家酒馆，门口有乐队，大家围在一起唱歌跳舞，老板问我们是哪里人，我说武汉，他说，“来跟我们一起玩吧，干杯！”这是唯一让我脱离焦虑的时刻。
In Kutta, passing by a tavern with a band at the door, everyone gathered to sing and dance, the boss asked us where we were from, and I said, Wuhan, he said, "Come and play with us, cheers!" It was the only time to get me out of anxiety.
这两天我去海边散步时，都在重新思考规划今后的生活，特殊的经历改变了我的一些思维方式。
These two days, when I was walking along the beach, I was rethinking my life, and my special experiences changed some of my thinking.
前天我搭乘火车从大阪市区搬到了郊外，为了节省住宿费。
I took a train from downtown Osaka to the suburbs the day before yesterday to save on room and board.
算上清洁费、税费，我需要把这笔费用控制在150元人民币以内。
Including cleaning fees and taxes, I need to keep the cost under 150 yuan.
一路上，我没有拿出手机，在公共场合我也是尽力说日语，不想旁人看到屏幕上的中文，内心对我感到恐慌，制造不必要的尴尬和麻烦。
Along the way, I did not take out my mobile phone, in public I also try to speak Japanese, do not want others to see the Chinese on the screen, the heart of me panic, create unnecessary embarrassment and trouble.
我甚至在付钱时，提前数好和金额对应的零钱，这样避免交流，看似简单的动作背后是非常复杂的心理活动，日本人不是向来都不喜欢麻烦别人吗？这就是流亡的感觉。
Even when I pay, I count the change in advance to avoid communication. Behind the seemingly simple act is a very complicated mental activity. Don't the Japanese always hate to bother others? This is the feeling of exile.
我出来大半个月了，每天吃饭都是在便利店和拉面馆解决，600日元一顿，约40元人民币。
I've been out for most of the month, eating at convenience stores and noodle shops for 600 yen, or about 40 yuan.
前两天看到一家店在卖上海炒面，我冲过去就买了一盒。
The other day I saw a shop selling Shanghai fried noodles. I rushed over and bought a box.
实话说并不好吃，但它是中国味道，距离家最近的东西。
To tell you the truth, it's not delicious, but it's Chinese flavor, the closest thing to home.
有一次去博物馆看一个展览活动，当主持人问大家都来自哪里时，我几乎紧张地在流汗。
Once I went to a museum to see an exhibition, and when the host asked where everyone was from, I was almost sweating nervously.
我是武汉人这个事实，我说或者不说，都觉得不好，这种感觉前所未有。
I am the fact that Wuhan people, I said or not, feel bad, this feeling is unprecedented.
昨天刚搬到郊区，路过一条薄薄的小溪，看到一只白鹤，周围是矮矮的平房民居，一切都是安静的，透亮的，焦躁了几天之后，心情一下变得舒缓起来。
Just moved to the suburbs yesterday, passing a thin creek, saw a white crane, surrounded by short bungalow houses, everything is quiet, bright, restless, after a few days of restlessness, a feeling of relief.
在网上看到附近有一家西安人开的店，据说很美味，我打算明天过去，主要是想和老板聊聊天，很想跟人说话，因为是一个人出来，我已经很久没说话了。
On the Internet, I saw a shop owned by Xi'an people. It is said that it is delicious. I plan to go there tomorrow. I would like to chat with my boss.
听说神奈川三蒲海岸的早樱已经开了，武汉的樱花呢？我和家人在汉口经营一家小店，并不怎么赚钱，这次它的命运就更模糊了。
I heard that the Sakura Coast of Kanagawa has been opened, and the cherry blossoms in Wuhan? My family and I do not make much money from running a small shop in Hankou.
但现在也只能走一步看一步，急忙赶回去我又能做什么？只会添麻烦。
But now can only walk one step at a time, hurry back to what I can do? Only add trouble.
我觉得武汉人很强，总会想办法，去创造条件解决困难，我能做的，就是开工之后再卯起劲来跑。
I think Wuhan people are very strong, will find a way to create conditions to solve the difficulties, I can do is to start work again after the sockets.
明知国内开往武汉的火车都停运了，我还是每天都会在去哪儿网上搜火车票，没想到自己这么独立的人，现在也会这么想家。
Knowing that the train from China to Wuhan is out of service, I still search the train ticket on the net every day. I didn't expect that person to be so independent.
“希望元宵节之前回家”，我在回国包机意向表的时间栏上写下了这句话。
"I hope to be home by the Lantern Festival," I wrote in the time bar of the charter flight indicative list.
