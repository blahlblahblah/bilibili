采访、撰文 | 赵力封 | 母亲反复清洗的棉质口罩投稿邮箱 | gayspot_edit@163.com1月31日，早上五点多，武力就醒了。
AT & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; gayspot _ edit @ 163.com.
他能听见隔壁母亲起床窸窸窣窣的声音。
He could hear the sound of next-door mothers rustling.
他知道七点一过，父亲会是这个家里第一个出门的。
He knew that his father would be the first to go out of the house after seven o'clock.
他要骑自行车到县里去。
He is going to ride his bicycle to the county.
父亲本来是不在县里的卫生部门工作的，但这一次新型冠状病毒引发的肺炎疫情来势汹汹，从1月26日起，父亲就和卫生部门的同事一起，每天都要出门检查，看哪个商户不按照要求还在偷偷营业，有没有人不戴口罩就出门。
Since January 26, his father, together with his health department colleagues, has been going out every day to check who is still operating clandestinely and whether anyone is going out without a mask.
“不能害己害人撒！”父亲最爱说的这句话有了用途。
"Do not harm others!" The father's favorite words have a purpose.
在差不多九点钟的时候，母亲也会出门。
At about nine o'clock my mother would go out, too.
母亲本来是没有工作的，父亲托关系给她在县里找了一份劳务派遣的工作，但因为疫情的缘故，母亲暂时不能去上班了。
Mother had no job, the father entrusted her to find a work dispatch in the county, but due to the outbreak of disease, her mother was temporarily unable to go to work.
母亲这个人闲不住，又高又瘦的母亲不仅干活是一把好手，现在又和村里几个同样在县里劳务派遣的男女组成了纠察队，每天在村里来回走四五趟。
His mother, who was restless and tall and thin, was not only a good worker, but was now picketing up and down the village four or five times a day with several men and women from the same county.
“我要出门了，饭在锅里，你自己热了吃，”母亲一边戴口罩出门一边提高了嗓门对二楼的武力说，“我今天应该回来得早一些，昨天被我们抓住的打麻将的那两家，今天应该不敢打了。
"I'm going out, the rice's in the pot, you're warming up," she said to the force on the second floor as she went out wearing a mask. "I should have come back earlier today.
” 从武汉回来1月23日，武汉封城的消息传来时，武力还没有那么紧张。
When word of the Wuhan city's closure came on January 23, the force of arms was not so intense.
反倒是随后的孝感封城，让武家四口人都有些慌了。
Instead, the filial piety that followed sealed the city, so that the Wu family of four people are a little panic.
武家生活在孝感市市属管辖的一个村落。
The Wu family lives in a village under the jurisdiction of Xiaogan City.
平时过年，村落里老人笑小孩叫的最是热闹。
Usually New Year, the village old people laugh at the children shouting is the most lively.
这两天村子里的人还都是张家长李家短地来回串门。
These two days the village people are also Zhang parents Li short back and forth door to door.
一天后，村委会发布了禁止随意出入的消息，并开始安排村委会的党员在仅有的两个出入口处值班。
A day later, the village council issued a ban on random entry and exit, and began arranging for members of the village council to work at the only two entrances.
“那些往农地里走的小岔路，我们是管不了的。
"We can't manage the little side roads that lead to the fields.
”母亲说。
"said the mother.
“你不要说是你从武汉回来了，”武力的父亲那天回家后叮嘱武力，“这事很严重。
"You don't want to say you're back from Wuhan," the violent father said after coming home that day. "It's serious.
”“怎么了？”和姐姐武春做饭的母亲听到了父亲的话，感觉他的表情十分凝重。
"" What's the matter? "The mother, who was cooking with her sister Wu Chun, heard his father's words and felt his expression very solemn.
“这一次的事情就是很严重。
"This time it was serious.
我不想让别人用有色眼镜看我们。
I don't want people to see us with colored glasses.
你只要不出去说你从武汉回来就好。
You just don't go out and say you come back from Wuhan.
”父亲用手敲了敲饭桌。
Father knocked at the table.
武力一直低着头，装作刷手机的样子，不敢抬头看父亲。
Force has been bowed head, pretend to brush mobile phone appearance, dare not look up at his father.
如果父亲知道，他是和自己的男朋友去武汉玩了四天，大概会把自己的皮扒了。
If the father knew that he and his boyfriend went to Wuhan for four days, he would probably skin himself.
自己从初中开始就喜欢同性，成为他内心里压迫自己的一块巨石。
From junior high school, he began to like same-sex, he became the heart of his own oppression of a huge rock.
此时，又多了一个武汉。
At this point, there is another Wuhan.
那天晚上，武力回到自己的房间和男朋友视频，“这一次的疫情很吓人的。
That night, armed to his room and boyfriend video, "This time the epidemic is frightening.
你有没有什么迹象？”男友没有，但他明显害怕了，“我们分开几天了？”武力算了一下，“三天了。
Do you have any sign? "Boyfriend did not, but he was obviously afraid," How long have we been apart? "Force calculated," Three days.
”男朋友心烦意乱，“我先挂了。
"My boyfriend got upset and said," I'll hang up first.
”武力也跟着烦了起来。
"Force grew weary of it.
这两个还在读大学三年级的男生去了很多繁华的地方，黄鹤楼、汉口商业区、武汉大学、飞机场、火车站……他一边翻看一边回忆这几天的路程，到最后甚至想把手机里拍的照片都删掉。
The two boys, who were still in their third year of college, went to many busy places, the Yellow Crane Tower, Hankou Commercial District, Wuhan University, Airport and Railway Station.
武力的胡思乱想被姐姐武春的哭声打断了。
The imagination of force was interrupted by the cries of her sister Wu Chun.
“为什么让我回去？”姐姐大声地问。
"Why should I go back?" asked my sister loudly.
“你小点声，”母亲的语气里有一丝哀求和不忍，“这是为了我们一家好！”“是为了你们三个人好！”姐姐的嗓子因为哽咽有些嘶哑。
"Keep your voice down," there was a note of supplication and intolerance in her mother's voice. "It's for the good of our family!" "It's for the three of you!" Her sister's voice was hoarse with sobs.
武春的个子矮小，不像父母和武力的个子都很高。
Wu Chun was short and short, unlike his parents and the tall man by force.
因为武春从小就营养不良。
Because Wuchun has been malnourished since childhood.
尤其是武家超生了弟弟武力之后，她就被送到了奶奶家，吃得更差，身体也更不好，每一次流感都能狠狠地抓住她。
Especially after the martial arts super-brother force, she was sent to the grandmother's house, eating worse, and worse health, every time the flu can grasp her mercilessly.
就算这样，父母还是都把好吃的好用的给了武力，还教育武春要好好照顾弟弟。
Even so, the parents still gave good use of good force, but also taught Wu Chun to take good care of his younger brother.
武力一直觉得自己对不起武春，为了逃避，甚至读大学都没有留在省内，而是跑到了北方。
Force has always felt sorry for Wu Chun, in order to escape, even the university did not stay in the province, but ran to the north.
但武春没有读大学，高中毕业后就在父母的要求下去工作了，甚至每到过年都会给武力一笔压岁钱。
But Wuchun did not go to college, high school graduates on the parents' request to go to work, even every Spring Festival will be a force for a lucky money.
“连我爸妈都不给我压岁钱，但是我姐给我。
"Even my parents don't give me lucky money, but my sister gives it to me.
”武力一想到这，鼻子又酸了。
"The very thought of it made the nose sour again.
他很爱哭。
He loves to cry.
1月24日，早上六点，武力猛地醒了。
On 24 January, at 6 a.m., the force of arms was violently aroused.
一扭头，看到枕头边放着一个红包，里面是三千块钱。
He turned around and saw a red envelope next to his pillow. Inside was three thousand dollars.
武力立刻明白了什么，披着羽绒服，光着腿，跑到姐姐的卧室里。
Force immediately understood what, put on a down jacket, barelegged, ran to my sister's bedroom.
果然，里面没有人。
Sure enough, there was nobody inside.
“我姐呢？”武力跑到父母的卧室，发现也没人。
"My elder sister?" The force ran to the parents bedroom, discovered also nobody.
整个家里只有自己！武力这才慌了。
The whole house was all by itself! Force was the only thing that panicked.
急忙打电话给武春。
Hurrying to call Wu Chun.
响了几声之后，武春接了电话，在吵杂的声音中，她说，“弟弟，姐姐今年不在家过年了。
After making a few noises, Wu Chun answered the phone and, in the midst of all the noise, said, "My brother, my sister is not at home this New Year.
爸妈送我来火车站。
My parents sent me to the railway station.
”“你去哪里？”武力下意识地问。
"Where are you going?" asked the force subconsciously.
“回厂里。
"Go back to the factory.
”武春哽咽了，“你和爸妈在家过个好年。
"Wu Chun choked." You and your parents spent a good year at home.
” 男友的信息武力是真的生气了。
The boyfriend's information force was really angry.
他把自己关在卧室里。
He shut himself up in his bedroom.
父母好像还不知道，从火车站回来以后，高高兴兴地准备着年夜饭，还把电视开得很大声。
My parents didn't seem to know that after coming back from the railway station, they happily prepared the New Year dinner and turned the TV up very loudly.
“他们把我姐送走了，”武力对男友说，“他们说是我姐从武汉回来的，而不是我。
"They sent my sister away," she told her boyfriend forcibly. "They said my sister had come back from Wuhan, not me.
希望这样能掩人耳目。
I hope this is a cover-up.
”说完，武力靠在墙上，仰着头，眼圈红了。
"And with that he leaned against the wall with his head turned up and his eyes red.
男友只能简单安慰他不要多想。
Boyfriend can only simply comfort him not to think more.
但话语也太苍白无力了。
But the words were too feeble.
武力心里特别难受。
Force is a terrible thing.
他不明白为什么要这样。
He did not understand why it was so.
一直到电视机里响起了春晚的欢乐声音，母亲在楼下喊他，他才别别扭扭地下了楼。
It was not until the cheery voice of the TV set that his mother called down to him and he went downstairs uneasily.
母亲看到武力的表情，就明白了。
The mother saw the look on her face and understood.
她往楼梯上走了几步，迎上来，小声叮嘱，“你别惹你爸生气。
She took a few steps up the stairs to meet her, and whispered, "Don't make your father angry.
今天可是过年！”“你们都知道是过年，还让我姐回厂子。
Today is the Chinese New Year! You all know it is the Chinese New Year and let my sister go back to the factory.
”武力小声顶撞着母亲。
"The force whispered against her mother.
“还不是你做的好事！”母亲似乎生气了，“你要是一放假就回家，不去武汉折腾，还能有这样的事？你又不是没去过武汉，非要今年巴巴又去一次！”母亲不想和武力争辩，转身下楼往厨房走，才走了几步，她忽然想起来什么，“你跟谁去的武汉？”被猛地问了这么一句，武力没反应过来，一下子被噎住了。
"It's not a good thing you did!" Mother seemed angry. "If you go home on holiday, not Wuhan, there can be such a thing?" Mother did not want to argue with force, turned down to the kitchen, just a few steps, she suddenly remembered, "Who you go to Wuhan?"
父亲在厨房里喊着母亲，母亲急忙过去。
Father was in the kitchen shouting to his mother, who hurried over.
武力给武春发视频，“姐，你咋又给我压岁钱？我都21岁了，也不是小孩子了！”武春已经到了工厂的宿舍里。
Force to Wu Chunfa video, "Sister, how do you give me lucky money? I am 21 years old, is not a child!" Wu Chun has arrived at the factory dormitory.
她笑笑，“今天我走的时候，他们给我带了不少东西呢！有肉，有排骨，有菜，还有我爱吃的虾，我正在煮着吃呢！”说完，还让武力看。
She smiled. "They brought me a lot of things today when I left. There was meat, ribs, vegetables, and my favorite shrimp, and I was cooking them!" And let's see.
武力这颗悬着的心才算是放了下来。
Force is the hanging of the heart is finally released.
他探头看了看厨房，父母还在张罗着菜。
He poked his head over the kitchen, where his parents were still hanging out the dishes.
他拨了视频给男友。
He dialed the video to his boyfriend.
男友按掉了没接，过了好半天，发了消息过来，“我心情不好，我还没告诉我爸妈，前几天我去武汉的事。
Boyfriend pressed did not answer, after a long time, sent a message over, "I feel bad, I have not told my parents, the other day I went to Wuhan.
但是我估计他们很快就会知道了。
But I expect they'll find out soon.
如果我感染了疫情，希望我爸妈没事。
If I get an epidemic, I hope my parents are okay.
据说这病会死人的。
It is said that the disease will kill.
”武力本来有些放松的心情，被男友这句话又刺激地提到了嗓子眼。
"Force was a little relaxed mood, by her boyfriend's words to stimulate the voice.
没有口罩了1月25日，村落里的鞭炮似乎都没有往年那么震耳欲聋了。
On January 25, firecrackers in the village didn't seem as deafening as they used to be.
武力躺在床上。
Lie down on the bed by force.
过了十点，父亲居然推门进来了，“你是不是发烧了？”一边说一边把手探过来。
After ten o'clock, my father pushed the door in. "Are you feverish?" he said as he reached over.
武力吓了一跳，“没发烧。
"Force started." No fever.
”他往旁边躲。
He hid himself away.
武力不习惯一向说一不二的父亲忽然这么“热情”。
Force is not used to always say that the father suddenly so "warm."
“没事就好。
"Just fine.
”父亲站直了身子，离开了武力的床，“快点起来！这都几点了！就算是放假，这么懒，也不应该！”父亲出去以后，武力给武春发了一个520块钱的红包。
The father straightened up and left the bed of force. "Get up! It's all the time! Even if it's a holiday, so lazy, it shouldn't be!"
武春半天也不肯收。
Wu Chun refused to take half a day.
武力下了最后通牒，“你不收，以后我也不要你的压岁钱了！”武春这才收了，“厂子里面都没什么人，就我和几个没回家的同事，大家说好了等下打牌的。
The ultimatum was given by force, "You don't accept it and I won't need your lucky money any more!" Wu Chun took it, "There is no one inside the factory, just a few colleagues who did not return home, we agreed to wait for the next game.
你不用担心我。
You needn't worry about me.
告诉爸妈我挺好的。
Tell Mom and Dad I'm fine.
”父亲是在大年初一的下午接到通知，要求从初二开始就上班。
My father was notified on the afternoon of New Year's Day that he would start work on the second day of junior high school.
母亲叫武力下楼，“你去买点口罩。
Mother told her to go downstairs by force. Go and buy some masks.
”武力不愿意去，磨磨蹭蹭的。
Force did not like to go; it dawdled.
母亲忍不住声音大起来，“这要是你姐在，早就出去了。
"Mother could not help crying out," If your sister had been here, she would have gone out.
你能不能麻利点！”武力不想顶嘴，默默地穿上羽绒服。
Can you be quick! "Force does not want to answer back, quietly put on a down jacket.
这个村子不大，只有一个药店，三个小超市，一个快递点。
The village was small, with only one drugstore, three small supermarkets and a express delivery point.
药店里的货架上，只摆着六个口罩，三个棉布款式，三个一次性医用口罩。
Only six masks, three cotton styles and three disposable medical masks were on shelves at the drugstore.
武力看了看，“没有别的口罩了吗？”“你是武家的那个小儿子？”看店的应该是店主的母亲，很热情，“我们存货不多啦，据说现在武汉里面都买不到口罩了。
Look at the force of arms, "no other masks?" "You are the Wu family's little son?" The shop should be the mother of the owner, very enthusiastic, "we are not much inventory, it is said that now Wuhan inside can not buy masks.
就这么几个，你还要吗？”武力琢磨了一下，摸出手机，看看网上还有没有货。
Just a few, do you still want? "The force ponders a bit, touch mobile phone, see if there is still on the net.
他很吃惊，居然网上都没有口罩了！他忙都买了下来，一共花了十五块钱。
He was surprised that there were no masks on the Internet! He was so busy that he bought them for fifteen dollars.
本来应该十六块钱的，店主的母亲给他抹去了一块钱。
It was supposed to be sixteen dollars, and the owner's mother wiped him a dollar.
武力不好意思就这么离开，又买了两瓶酒精。
Force was too embarrassed to leave and bought two more bottles of alcohol.
后来，父亲还表扬，“到底是读了大学的人，想的就是比我们周全。
Later, the father also praised, "after all, college students, think than we are more comprehensive.
”在接下来的几天里，武力的父母就是靠着这两瓶酒精来消毒的。
For the next few days, the two bottles of alcohol were used by the parents to sterilize the force.
回到家，武力和母亲讲述了买口罩的经历。
Back home, force and mother told the story of buying a mask.
母亲很紧张，“你还是别出去了，这几天在家里呆着。
Mother was very nervous. "You'd better not go out and stay at home these days.
不要让别人看到你。
Don't let anyone see you.
”姐姐丢弃的留有口红印的口罩我也有秘密从1月26日开始，被母亲要求呆在家里的武力闷得不得了，每天除了看着母亲一天两次到村子里广播，“不要拜年！不要打麻将！不要打牌！不要聚餐！不要请客！在家呆着！出门戴口罩！”大部分时间，他就是在家里楼上楼下地来回走着。
My sister's discarded mask with lipstick stains I've had a secret, too, since Jan. 26, and he's been walking up and down the stairs most of the time except watching his mother broadcast twice a day to the village saying, "No New Year! No mahjong! No cards! No dinner! No invitations! Stay home!
男友只是偶尔和自己视频。
Boyfriend only occasionally video with himself.
反倒是武春，每天都和他聊半个钟头，“你不要担心我，你自己多注意，毕竟你在家住着，我在厂子里没事。
Instead, Wu Chun talked to him every day for half an hour. "Don't worry about me, you should pay more attention to yourself.
”1月29日，武力不知道自己是怎么想的，那句话就从嘴里冒了出来，“姐，如果我喜欢男生，你能接受吗？”后来，他自己琢磨，应该是看到每天都在增长的感染人数和死亡人数，让他终于心生害怕。
On January 29, the force of arms did not know what he was thinking, and the phrase came out of his mouth, "Sister, if I like boys, can you accept it?" Then he thought to himself, "It's the number of infections and deaths that are increasing every day, that finally frightens him.
“就是那种到死都没有人知道真实的自己是什么样子的恐惧。
"The fear that no one will ever know what they really are until they die.
”武力和男友解释。
Force and Boyfriend explained.
听到这话的武春，在镜头那端明显一愣，然后嗓门一下子大起来，直接叫出了武力的名字，“你不要闹！父母为了生你，当年可是离家到了外地去，还罚了款。
Hearing this, Wu Chun, in the lens at the end of a clear Leng Leng, and then suddenly a loud voice immediately called out the name of force, "You do not make noise!
你不能这样的！”武力听武春这么说完，就暗自埋怨自己，不该这么轻易就告诉了姐姐。
You can't do this! "Wu Chun heard the use of force said, secretly reproach themselves, should not have told her sister so easily.
哪怕自己觉得再对不起姐姐，也不应该说实话。
You shouldn't tell the truth, even if you feel sorry for your sister.
现在可麻烦了，姐姐明显就是接受不了自己是一个Gay的事实。
Now the trouble is, my sister obviously just can't accept the fact that she is a Gay.
而且，武力不知道武春到底是怎么想的。
Moreover, the force of arms do not know what Wu Chun is thinking.
现在到处都封闭着，姐姐是不是也没有办法去向别人了解类似的情况呢？越想越不知所措，武力便给男友发信息。
Now that it was all sealed off, did my sister have no way to find out what the situation was like? The more confused I became, the more I used force to send messages to my boyfriend.
男友慢吞吞，半天才回了一条，“你在说之前怎么不想清楚？”武力没料到男友会这么说。
Boyfriend slowly, half a day to return one, "you said before why not clear?" Force did not expect her boyfriend to say so.
此时的武力感觉自己好像被最亲爱的姐姐和才在一起没有半年的男友“背叛”了。
At this point the force of the feeling that they are the dearest sister and only together for half a year of boyfriend "betrayal."
武力在心里想，难道自己对姐姐出柜，就是为了自己吗？是，也不是。
Force in the heart to think that their sister out of the closet, is it for their own? Yes, not.
武力感觉自己被分成了三个人。
Force felt itself divided into three men.
第一个人是自己，他希望自己活的自由自在的，在这个父亲说一不二的家里，他不用总是像在扮演着什么一样。
The first man was himself, and he wished to be free, and he did not always act as if he were in the house where the father spoke.
第二个人是为了男友。
The second one's for boyfriends.
虽然武力知道，男友是一定不会出柜的，他的父母年纪大了，而且是那种古板的人。
Though he knew by force that his boyfriend would never come out, his parents were old and stuffy.
虽然两个人在一起的时间很短，但武力总想试一试能不能走得更长久。
Although the two men had been together for a short time, the force of arms always wanted to see if it would last longer.
可武力忽略了，在疫情如此严重的情况下，告诉男友自己出柜，似乎只会让他更有压力，而不是让他更有安全感。
But force ignores the fact that in a situation as serious as this one, telling your boyfriend to come out seems to make him more stressed than secure.
但武力毕竟只有21岁。
But force is only 21 years old.
最后一个人，武力心底里有一个很细小的声音，希望姐姐武春明白，自己并没有看上去那么轻松幸福，至少也是有痛苦，有秘密的。
Finally, the force of the heart of a very small voice, I hope my sister Wu Chun understand that they do not look so relaxed and happy, at least there is pain, there are secrets.
只是姐姐并不认为这是他的痛苦，这反倒成了姐姐的一个痛苦。
But his sister did not think it was his pain, but a pain to her.
武力越想越烦，发了一个朋友圈，“如今的爱情，也许超过一年，就已经算是白头偕老了。
The more you think of force, the more upset you become, and the circle of friends, "Today's love, perhaps more than a year, is a long life together.
”武力很想告诉姐姐一件事母亲回来的时候，武力已经睡着了。
"Force wanted to tell her sister something. When her mother came back, she was asleep by the force of arms.
等他醒了，发现母亲把口罩洗了，晾在一楼楼梯和厨房之间绑着的那根绳子上，平时这里挂着围裙、外套。
When he woke up, he found his mother had washed the mask and hung it on a string between the ground floor stairs and the kitchen, where aprons and jackets were usually hung.
武力很惊讶，“妈，这口罩不能洗吧！”母亲听到武力的话，从厨房里走了出来，“不洗怎么用呢？现在到处都买不戴口罩了。
The force is surprised, "Mom, this mask can't be washed!" Mother heard the force of the words, out of the kitchen, "do not wash how to use it? Now everywhere no wearing masks.
”“那你不要出去了，就在家呆着啊！”武力说。
"Then do not go out, but stay at home," said the sword.
母亲是不肯的，“你爸天天出门，我这心里很担心，要是让我整天在家，就该胡思乱想了。
Your father goes out every day, and I'm so worried that if I stay at home all day, I'll think about it.
还不如每天都出门走走。
Better to walk out every day.
其实村里的人都差不多认识，爱打麻将的就那么几家，根本不用天天出去啦！就是找个事做，分分心。
In fact, the village people almost know, like playing Mahjong only a few, do not have to go out every day! Is to find something to do, distracted.
”说了一大段话的母亲似乎有点不好意思，急忙问，“饿了吧，我给你做饭吃。
"The mother, who had said a great deal, seemed embarrassed, and asked hastily," Hungry, I will cook for you.
”武力摇摇头，“我去远一点的药店，看看有没有卖口罩的。
"Force shook his head." I went to a distant drugstore to see if there were any masks left.
”母亲笑了，“你不出门就是节省口罩了。
"My mother smiled." If you don't go out, you save your mask.
我平时洗一洗，这个老式的棉布口罩还能用的。
I usually wash it, but this old cotton mask will work.
”武力鼻子一酸。
"The nose is sour.
他这才发现，父母之间的亲情似乎就是自己一直寻觅和盼望着的爱情样板。
He then discovered that the parent's affection seems to be the love model that he has been looking for and looking forward to.
母亲走进厨房开始准备晚饭。
Mother went into the kitchen and began to prepare supper.
武力看看时间，父亲从县里回来，骑自行车差不多还要三十分钟。
Take a look at the time. Father came back from the county. It was almost thirty minutes by bike.
他回到卧室继续想心事。
He went back to his bedroom to think.
武力不得不承认，自己对姐姐武春并不算好。
Force has to admit that their sister Wu Chun is not good.
在大年三十那天，当父母担心别人知道自己从武汉回来，而让姐姐说是她去了武汉玩，现在要离开这个村子的时候，为什么自己就不能勇敢一点地站出来呢？至少可以说一句，让姐姐暖心的话吧。
In the New Year's Eve, when the parents worried that others know that she came back from Wuhan, and let her sister say that she went to Wuhan to play, now to leave the village, why not dare to stand up a little bit?
而此时的武力虽然可以舒舒服服地躺在家里，心里更害怕的却是，姐姐武春会不会也因为这么多年的委屈，把自己的真实情况告诉家里呢？但要武力自己主动去找父母说明，这对他来说难上加难。
At this time, although the force of force can be comfortable lying at home, the heart is more scared is that the elder sister Wuchun will also be aggrieved by so many years, tell their true situation to their families? But it is very difficult for him to voluntarily go to his parents.
“也许以后会说吧！”武力在心里对自己承诺，“但不是现在。
"Perhaps later!" The force of arms promised itself, "but not now.
”1月30日的晚上，父亲回到家里的时候，疲惫中透着一丝高兴，“今天走了好多路，口罩也湿了，到处都没有卖的。
"On the night of January 30, when my father came home, he was a little bit tired and happy." I walked a lot today, my mask was wet and I didn't sell it anywhere.
幸亏是县里给每个工作人员发了一包口罩，说是以后用完了，还会给补发的。
Fortunately, the county to each staff member issued a packet of masks, said that it will be used up later, will be reissued.
”说完，把一包用透明塑料袋装着的一次性医用口罩放到桌子上，“你俩也用吧，一旦出了家门，就要戴口罩！”晚上吃饭的时候，大家照例互相问了一下是不是发烧、咳嗽。
"Then put a package of disposable medical masks in clear plastic bags on the table." You can use them, too, and wear masks once you get out of the house! "At dinner, people routinely ask each other if they have a fever or cough.
特别是武春，母亲每天都会给武春打电话。
Especially Wuchun, mother will call Wu Chun every day.
那一天也不知道怎么了，母亲打开了免提。
I don't know what happened that day, but my mother opened it.
换作以前，武力一定会很主动地和武春说话，可那天他紧张得说不出话来。
Before, the force of arms will be very active to talk to Wu Chun, but that day he was too nervous to speak.
而武春的语气听起来一如往常。
Wu Chun's tone sounded as usual.
直到最后，要不是母亲说了句“武力也和姐姐说句话”，恐怕姐弟俩都不会互相互相打个招呼。
At last, I am afraid that neither of the sisters would have said hello to each other had it not been for the words "by force of arms."
母亲似乎察觉出了什么，挂断电话后问武力，“你俩吵架了吗？”武力摇摇头，心想，恐怕比吵架更难熬。
The mother seemed to sense something, hung up the phone and asked for force, "Have you quarreled?" shaking her head violently, thinking, I'm afraid it's harder than quarrelling.
他发现自己居然不信任姐姐，生怕武春“害”了自己。
He found that he did not trust his sister, for fear that Wu Chun "hurt" himself.
一直到2月2日，武力和男友已经离开武汉十三天了，一点症状都没有。
By February 2, the force and boyfriend had left Wuhan for 13 days, without any symptoms.
两个人视频聊天的次数也逐渐多了起来，每天都有三四次视频，每次都要半个小时。
The number of video chats between the two men gradually increased, with three or four videos a day, each time taking half an hour.
男友的表情和语气也越来越轻松了，偶尔还开开玩笑。
Her boyfriend's expression and tone of voice became more relaxed, occasionally joking.
但武力知道，他和男友之间的感情出现了些许裂纹，哪怕很轻微。
But the force knew that his relationship with his boyfriend had a little crack, even if it was slight.
在他看来，两个人在前两天的通话里，彼此更多地是顾及自己的感受，而非对方的。
In his view, two people in the first two days of the conversation, more about their feelings, not each other's.
他不知道这是不是因为疫情太过严重，或者两个人的感情还不够长久。
He did not know whether it was because the epidemic was too severe or because the relationship between the two was not long enough.
至于武春，武力还是没有勇气联系。
As for Wu Chun, force still has no courage to contact.
而武春也没有主动联系他。
Wu Chun did not contact him.
武力只能等待。
Force can only wait.
让武力提心吊胆的是，武春越是安静，他越是心里没有着落，姐姐究竟会把自己的秘密也当作秘密，还是会把这件事告诉父母？或者成为姐姐反过来要挟自己的砝码？可武力的“担心”，又让他觉得有些对不起姐姐这么多年的付出。
To the horror of force, the quieter Wu Chun was, the more unassured he was, whether his sister would keep her secret as a secret, or would she tell her parents, or whether she would in turn hold her own weight?
但武力很想告诉姐姐一件事。
But Force wanted to tell her one thing.
2月2日的晚饭后，武力帮着母亲收拾，装作不经意地问了母亲，“为什么一定要让姐姐离开呢？其实我从回来到现在，都没有人知道我是从武汉回来的啊！”母亲背对着武力，忙碌着，“我们是都知道你是从武汉回来的啊！所以让春妹离开，一旦我们不幸都感染了，至少她被感染的几率还会小一些。
After dinner on February 2, the armed forces helped her mother clean up, pretending to inadvertently asked her mother, "Why must I let my sister leave? In fact, no one knows I came back from Wuhan!"
”武力的鼻子一酸。
"The nose of force is sour.
或许这就是他的家庭，非常普通。
Maybe this is his family, very ordinary.
而无论如何，就算疫情当前，很多人的选择有了让其他人难以理解的模样，但生活终究会继续，亲情也总是难以隔断。
And in any case, even with the current epidemic, many people choose to look at it in ways that others find difficult to understand, but life will continue, and kinship will always be difficult to sever.
