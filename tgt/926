面对依然紧张的防疫形势，上海的街道、居民区、楼宇不断放出防疫大招，以上海人特有的智慧筑起“上海堡垒”，守卫这座城市。
Confronted with the still-tense epidemic situation, the streets, residential areas and buildings of Shanghai are constantly releasing epidemic prevention tactics and using the unique wisdom of Shanghainese to build a "fortress of Shanghai" to guard the city.
文 |陈　冰2月10日是上海正式意义上的“复工日”，在经历了一个史无前例安静春节之后，人员返程、企业复工，面对依然紧张的防疫形势，上海的街道、居民区、楼宇不断放出防疫大招，以上海人特有的智慧筑起“上海堡垒”，守卫这座城市。
Chen Bing, the official Shanghai day for returning to work on February 10, returned to work after an unprecedented quiet Spring Festival. Faced with the still-tense epidemic prevention situation, Shanghai's streets, residential areas and buildings have continually unleashed an epidemic prevention campaign, building a "citadel of Shanghai" and guarding the city with the unique wisdom of a Shanghainese.
_奉贤区：用无人机筑起“结界”“有没有湖北回来的？”“有没有出去玩路过武汉的？”“有没有发烧、咳嗽的?”“鄂字开头的车辆有没有？”1608户，4700多位居民，在新型冠状病毒感染肺炎疫情全国拉响警报的同时，金海街道金水苑居民区的防疫战役也打响了。
Have you ever gone out to play in Wuhan? Do you have any fever, cough? Do you have an E-word-opening vehicleDo you have a fever, cough? Do you have an E-bike with a headline.1608 households, 4,700 residents, were alerted by the outbreak of pneumonia on the new coronavirus.
1月26日，经过一番摸排，金水苑居民区党支部书记、居委会主任陆杰和他的战友们确定了6户为重点居家隔离的人员，确定好定点联系人，并建立微信群，保证随时可以沟通情况。
On January 26, following a series of mapping exercises, Lu Jie, secretary of the Jinshui Yuan Neighbourhood Party Branch and head of the neighborhood committee, Lu Jie, and his comrades-in-arms identified six households as key household isolators, identified fixed-point contacts and established micro-groups to ensure ready communication.
让陆杰印象最深的是大年初三晚上，居家隔离对象王某的凌晨来电。
Lu Jie impressed the most is the New Year's Eve, home isolation object Wang Mou's early morning call.
“大约快晚上3点不到，他突然来电话说小孩子发烧了。
"Shortly before three o'clock in the evening, he suddenly called and said the child had a fever.
我赶忙戴好口罩赶到他家，把小孩子送医院治疗。
I quickly put on my mask and rushed to his house to take the child to hospital.
一直陪着小朋友做完各类检查，医生最后确诊是支气管炎，不是新冠病毒感染肺炎。
Accompanying the children to do all kinds of examinations, the final diagnosis is bronchitis, not the new crown virus pneumonia.
大松了一口气，天也亮了。
There was a big sigh of relief and it was light.
”居家隔离的这些天，隔离居民们的食品、药物、日常生活用品的采买等居委会的干部们全包了，5楼、6楼一天跑上跑下好几次，甚至还帮一户居民家里的小朋友打印了寒假作业。
During these days of isolation, cadres from neighborhood committees, which separate residents from food, medicines and daily necessities, ran up and down several times a day on the fifth and sixth floors, and even helped children in one family print their homework during the winter vacation.
陆杰说：“我过去是军人，现在虽然不穿军装了，但社区一样也是我的战场。
"I used to be a soldier, but now I don't wear a uniform, but the community is a battleground for me," he said.
”十几天没有休息过的陆杰却因为女儿的一封信而哽咽了。
Lu Jie, who had not rested for ten days, choked with a letter from his daughter.
____亲爱的爸爸：晚上好呀！自新型冠状病毒感染肺炎疫情以来，您就没有出现在我们家的餐桌旁，您不厌其烦地给湖北返乡的居民打电话确认情况。
Dear Dad, Good evening, you have not appeared at our dinner table since the new coronavirus infection. You have taken pains to call the residents of Hubei Province to confirm the situation.
自大年三十起，您的春节休假就“不翼而飞”了，本该一家人团圆，取而代之的是在一栋栋居民楼中穿梭。
Since New Year's Eve, your Spring Festival holiday has "disappeared", the family should be reunited, instead of in a residential building shuttle.
您虽不是站在疫情防控的最前线，但也为疫情的防控做了至关重要的贡献。
Although you are not in the forefront of the prevention and control of the epidemic, but also for the prevention and control of the epidemic made a crucial contribution.
在防疫面前，在一场没有硝烟、看不见敌人的战场上，您无私奉献着自己，您全副武装，逆风前行的身影让我肃然起敬，那种舍小家为大家的精神，真是个伟大的逆行英雄。
In the face of epidemic prevention, in a smoke-free, invisible enemy in the battlefield, you selflessly dedicated themselves, you armed, the shadow of the wind forward let me awe, the kind of small house for the spirit of everyone, is really a great retrograde hero.
此致敬礼！爱你的女儿杨慧娴2月7日晚7时30分，一架无人机绕着悦达南郊华都小区来回飞了好几圈，时高时低，时快时慢，操控无人机的是个小伙子，旁边站着小区综合管理办负责人、屠家村书记、小区物业经理等。
Love Your Daughter Yang Huixian February 7, 2007 At 7: 30 p.m., a drone circled the southern suburbs of Yueda, flying several times, with varying degrees of speed and speed. The UAV was operated by a young man who stood next to the head of the Integrated Management Office, Tu's secretary, and the district property manager.
“拍得清楚吗？”一群人在这个冬夜的寒风里站着，格外显眼。
"Did you get a good picture?" A group of people stood out in the cold winter night.
到底在拍什么？原来是小区综合管理办这两天在紧锣密鼓地排摸外地入（返）奉贤人员信息，怕有遗漏，就想到了晚上看亮灯的办法，但是，小区的楼层有29层，靠人工数灯实在困难。
In the end, what is the plot comprehensive management office in the past two days in the intense row of information into (back) people in the field, for fear of omission, think of the way to see the lights at night, but there are 29 floors, the cell floor is really difficult to rely on artificial lights.
小区增援单位、区文化执法大队得知情况后，主动帮忙联系了无人机，航拍居民楼，再看着照片一家家排摸登记人员信息。
Community reinforcements, district cultural law enforcement brigade learned of the situation, took the initiative to help contact the UAV, aerial photographs of residential buildings, and then look at the photographs of the registration personnel.
无人机+移动音响+小喇叭的全方位立体式宣传也上阵了。
The UAV + mobile stereo + the omni-directional stereo propaganda of the trumpet also came on the scene.
“重要的事情说三遍，隔离期间不要出门！不要出门！不要出门！”近日来，金水苑地区上空不时传来“不要出门”的宣传语，抬头望去，空中有架绑着小喇叭的六旋翼无人机，围着4个小区在不停地飞，边飞边循环播放宣传告示。
"Important things said three times, do not go out during the isolation! Don't go out!" In recent days, the region of Jinshui Yuan from time to time, "do not go out!"
居委工作人员拿着移动音响循环播放宣传告示+志愿者拿着小喇叭巡逻+空中无人机喊话，这波全方位立体式的宣传，就问在家的你，有没有听到！_宝山区：“特派快递员”上岗，保障隔离居民生活随着疫情的发展，基层防控工作强度不断加大，宝山区宝钢六村党总支高璐书记向支部主动请缨，一人负责起整个小区危险系数最高的工作：全力保障好小区内武汉回沪居家隔离人员的正常生活。
(2008-12-26 09: 55) Home Affairs Committee Staff Play Publicity Notices with Mobile Audio Cycle + Volunteers carrying a trumpet patrol + aerial drone call, do you hear this all-directional stereo propaganda?
除了提醒测量体温，帮助买药、买菜、买水果，甚至帮拿快递、送面膜都成为了他的新增“服务”内容。
In addition to reminding temperature measurement, helping to buy medicine, vegetables, fruit, and even express delivery, facial mask has become his new "service" content.
这个“特派快递员”除了跑腿勤快、服务到位之外，还加了隔离人员的微信，每天通过观察微信步数管控隔离人员居家隔离情况！关心隔离人员的心理状况也成为高书记非常重要的一项工作内容，“他们安全，居民更有安全感呐”。
In addition to running errands and delivering services, the messenger added a letter from the quarantine officer, who monitors the segregation of people's homes by observing the number of microsteps every day. "Concern for the psychological well-being of the isolated people has become an important part of the Secretary's work.
口罩告急。
Mask crisis.
怎么办？由于宝钢六村小区老年人较多，考虑到排队购买口罩容易存在非常高的交叉感染风险，高书记果断拍板——开通社区通留言板块报名以及手机电话短信报名通道。
How to do? Because Baosteel Six Village area more elderly people, taking into account the queue to buy masks are prone to a very high risk of cross-infection, Secretary-General decisive clap - open the community message board registration and mobile phone short message registration channels.
通过预约登记，居委会工作人员电话通知排号居民，分流取购买口罩凭证。
Through booking registration, neighborhood committee staff to notify residents by telephone, shunt to purchase a mask certificate.
“线上预约+线下取单”的方式，不仅减少人员交叉感染风险，还进一步避免了排不到号、第二天继续排队的尴尬。
Online booking and off-line pick-up not only reduces the risk of cross-infection, but also further avoids the embarrassment of having to wait in line until the next day.
这一方式，得到居民的一致叫好。
This approach was applauded unanimously by the residents.
连日来，社区干部白加黑、连轴转，奔波在排摸、宣传、预约口罩、服务保障居家隔离人员等各个一线环节，怎样才能让他们“喘口气”“歇个脚”呢？针对居委书记连续多日高强度超负荷作战、已显疲态，出现低烧、头晕、乏力等不适情况的问题，宝山区友谊路街道党工委一方面从街道机关遴选优秀年轻干部下沉居委提供支撑，另一方面精心选派多名“立方工作室”老书记担当“临时书记”，重出江湖到工作量比较大、比较困难的居民区报道。
In recent days, community officials have been making efforts to relieve pressure on residents by adding black and white, rotating around the axis. How can they take their breath and rest from the streets after days of high-intensity overloading, fatigue, low-grade fever, dizziness and fatigue?
龚秋慧就是友谊路街道居民区退休的老书记，曾经历过“非典”疫情，有着丰富的应急处置工作经验，作为“临时书记”，他迅速上岗，带领居委干部做好人员摸排、口罩登记、报表统计等工作。
