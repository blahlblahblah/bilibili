作者 | 孟亚娜编辑 | 凌远川突如其来的新型冠状病毒肺炎，让传统的线下教育成为疫情之下的重灾区。
Ring Yuanchuan's sudden new coronavirus pneumonia has made traditional subonline education a major casualty of the epidemic.
疫情发生后，大量线下教育培训机构被迫停课。
After the outbreak, a large number of offline education and training institutions were forced to suspend classes.
即便是教育行业龙头企业好未来和新东方，此次也受到了冲击。
Even if the education industry leader enterprise good future and the new east, this time also suffered the impact.
1月20日，武汉学而思和武汉新东方先后发布了停课通知。
On January 20, Wuhan Xueresis and Wuhan New Oriental issued a notice of suspension.
这两家教育巨头，都曾经受过非典疫情的考验，在疫情发生之后，迅速做出了响应，停课并协调转线上。
Both education giants, who had been tested by the SARS epidemic, responded quickly after the outbreak, suspending classes and coordinating the transition.
新东方董事长俞敏洪，近日公开发文写道，这场疫情，也给新东方带来了严峻考验，新东方地面课堂全面停课。
The outbreak has also brought a severe test to New Oriental, with ground classes in New Oriental suspended altogether, Yu Minhong, New Oriental's chairman, wrote in a recent public message.
上百万寒假班的学生面临不能上课的局面。
Millions of students in winter vacation classes face being unable to attend classes.
如果新东方全部停课退费，新东方就只能关门大吉，七八万老师员工的生计，立刻就成了问题。
If New Oriental all school refund fees, New East will have to close down, 780,000 teachers and staff of the livelihood, immediately became a problem.
“面对疫情最好的方法就是把课堂搬到线上。
"The best way to deal with the epidemic is to move the classroom online.
”俞敏洪提到，新东方的在线系统没准备好，而且大多数老师没有在线授课经验，学生家长是否愿意接受在线上课都是问题。
Ms Yu said New Oriental's online system was not ready and most teachers did not have online experience, and parents' willingness to take classes online was a problem.
但不管怎样，转变总比坐以待毙要好，否则接近三十年的新东方，将会山崩地裂。
Either way, the change is better than waiting to die, or the New East, nearly three decades ago, will fall apart.
危机往往伴随着机遇。
Crises often come with opportunities.
回望2003年的非典一疫，差点让新东方倒闭，但同时也成就了好未来。
Looking back on the SARS epidemic in 2003, New Oriental almost collapsed, but it also created a good future.
非典疫情期间，传统线下培训被叫停，网校兴起。
During the SARS epidemic, the traditional off-line training was stopped, the rise of network schools.
传统教育培训机构新东方遭遇了停课退费难题，俞敏洪举债度过危机。
New Oriental traditional education and training institutions encountered the problem of school refund, Yu Minhong debt through the crisis.
而当时的张邦鑫，乘着网校的东风，和几个好友创办了奥数网，也就是学而思网校的前身，顺利将线下的生源成功导流到了线上。
At that time, Zhang Bang Xin, riding the network school Dongfeng, and a few friends founded the network, that is to say, the predecessor of Xueshi net school, successfully channel the offline students to the line.
疫情之下，大机构枪支弹药充足，尚可以熬过一劫，但对于一些传统做线下的中小教培机构来说，却是如临大敌，能否活着熬过疫情是个问题。
Under the epidemic situation, the large institutions have plenty of guns and ammunition, but for some small and medium-sized training institutions under the line, it is a problem whether they can survive the epidemic.
他们面临着来自种种不确定因素的挑战，军心难稳、获客难、退费风险、高额租金和工资开支……入不敷出，停业观望“每年二月份本来是爆发期，往年春节过后的半个月能做平时一个月的流水，但没想到受疫情影响，到二月底都没办法开业。
They are challenged by uncertainty, insecurity, difficulties in getting visitors, risk of reimbursement, high rent and salary outlays... "February is supposed to be an outbreak, and half a month after the Spring Festival is usually followed by a month of running water, but the epidemic has affected them and they will not be able to start business by the end of February.
”线下舞蹈培训机构负责人丽娜告诉燃财经，受疫情影响，她在北京的四家线下门店无法正常开门营业，每个月面临将近20万的资金压力，对她而言简直是毁灭性打击。
Lina, director of the offline dance training group, told Flaming Finance that her four off-line stores in Beijing were unable to open normally due to the outbreak and were under financial pressure of nearly 200,000 a month, devastating for her.
“现在也不知道什么时候能开工，我们有可能到五月份都缓不过来。
"We don't know when we can start, and we're probably not going to be able to get over it until May.
这是我过的最差的一个春节，度日如年。
This is the worst Spring Festival I have ever lived.
”丽娜说。
'she said.
过去的2019年，对于教育行业本就是不易的一年，在K12、早教和语培留学机构等领域，多家机构暴雷倒闭。
The past 2019 has been a tough year for the education sector, with institutions failing in areas such as K12, early education and language-training institutes.
曾经被捧为独角兽的在线少儿思维培训机构成长保资金链断裂倒闭，A股老牌留学机构太傻留学破产清算，年底英语口语培训机构韦博英语欠款关闭。
The growth and security system of the online children's train of thought, once touted as the unicorn, broke down, and the A-share institution went bankrupt.
但未曾想到2020年开年，因为疫情的影响，一些教育培训机构迎来了更大的经营危机。
But we did not expect to start the year 2020, because of the impact of the epidemic, some educational and training institutions have ushered in a greater business crisis.
图 / Pexels丽娜的情况并非个例。
The case of Tu / Pexels Rina is not unique.
2月6日晚，IT职业教育企业兄弟连教育正式宣告品牌“破产”，成为了新冠肺炎疫情影响下，被现金流压垮的首家线下培训机构。
On the night of Feb. 6, IT vocational education company brother even declared the brand "bankrupt", became the first offline training institution to be crushed by cash flow under the impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic.
兄弟连创始人李超发了一封公开信，他在信中提到，兄弟连教育在节前已经非常紧张，缓发工资、全体动员、压缩成本，本来准备在节后招生旺季打个翻身仗，但这次疫情来的如此凶猛、猝不及防，把计划全部打乱了。
Brother even founder Li Chao sent an open letter, in which he said the brother even before the festival, education is already very tense, slow wages, mobilization, cost reduction, prepared for the post-season recruitment season, but the outbreak came so fierce, unexpected, and completely upset the plan.
疫情之下，线下教培机构入不敷出，大多企业账面上的现金难以撑过三个月，还有多数中小企业甚至连一个月都熬不过。
Under the epidemic, the offline training institutions live beyond their means, most companies on the books of cash can not last three months, and most small and medium-sized enterprises can not even survive a month.
机构何时能正常营业，房租、职工薪资、社保该如何缴纳，学员留存率、续费率该如何保障，一切都成为了未知。
When the organization will be able to operate normally, rent, workers' salaries, social security how to pay, trainee retention rate, renewal rate how to guarantee, everything has become unknown.
多位艺术、体育类培训、民营幼儿园线下教育机构创业者向燃财经表示，如果疫情继续持续下去几个月，对他们而言将是毁灭性的打击。
Several entrepreneurs of arts and sports training and private kindergartens have told the business that if the epidemic continues for months, it will be a devastating blow to them.
同样遭受到打击的还有体培行业，多位体育培训业内人士对燃财经表示，线下场馆关停，目前处于被迫停业中。
Also hit by the body culture industry, a number of sports training industry insiders told Flaming Finance, off-line venues closed, is currently forced out of business.
“对于体培行业转线上也是不现实的，只能坐等恢复营业。
"It is unrealistic to turn the volume industry around, and we have to wait for it to resume."
”某少儿篮球培训学校负责人张峰说。
Zhang Feng, director of a children's basketball training school, said.
民营幼儿园往往采取的是预收费模式，短期内暂停营业并不会造成太大影响。
Private kindergartens often adopt the model of prepayment, short-term suspension will not cause too much impact.
但疫情结束时间未知，一些实力较雄厚的民办国际幼儿园也产生了担忧。
But the end of the epidemic time unknown, some of the more powerful private international kindergarten has also given rise to concern.
“我们的国际幼儿园资历比较久，撑过二月份没问题，但如果疫情战线持续拉长，也会有一定风险。
"Our international kindergarten has a long history and will last through February, but there are risks if the epidemic continues to spread.
“孩子的故事国际连锁幼儿园董事长王应运说。
"Children's Story International Kindergarten Chain Chairman Wang Ying-yun said.
”一些传统的线下留学语培中介机构面临着挑战，留学业务的签证申请和雅思托福考试的进行，均受到了影响。
Some of the traditional IELTS intermediaries face challenges, and visa applications for study abroad and the conduct of IELTS TOEFL have been affected.
“某留学语培机构负责人高益告诉燃财经，“好在我们是纯线上，现在和平时没太大区别，反而生意还会比之前好些，可能就是员工之间的沟通少了点。
"Fortunately, we are on a pure line, it is not much different now, but business will be better than before, maybe there is less communication between employees.
”望星盼月希望疫情早点结束疫情发生后，也有一些线下培训机构紧急将课程搬到线上，但短时间多数学生和老师涌入，导致多家第三方教育平台超负荷运转，服务器几近崩盘。
"Watching stars hope the outbreak will end sooner, and some off-line training providers are urgently moving courses online, but the influx of students and teachers for a short period of time has left many third-party education platforms overloaded and servers close to collapse.
“这个星期我们基本上干了今年一年要做的事情，很多老师和学生都涌上平台上课，导致平台负载率过高。
"This week we've basically done what we're going to do this year and a lot of teachers and students are on the platform, resulting in a very high platform load rate.
”某在线教育平台负责人王伟告诉燃财经，为了保证平台正常运行，他紧急加了一些负载加速器和带宽。
Wang Wei, director of an online education platform, told Flaming Finance that he had added some speed accelerators and bandwidth to keep the platform running properly.
购买带宽需要付费，但他提供给一些学校和机构的服务都是免费的。
He pays for the bandwidth, but the services he provides to some schools and institutions are free of charge.
“其实我们并没有从中盈利。
"We didn't make a profit out of it.
”王伟说。
"said Wang Wei.
对于舞蹈、体育和民营幼儿园等线下培训业务而言，将教学搬到线上不太现实，对此机构负责人们只能采取一些直播、社群打卡、提供心理咨询服务等迂回之策。
For off-line training services such as dance, sports and private kindergartens, it is not realistic to move instruction online, for which institutional managers have had to resort to circuitous methods such as live broadcasting, community-based card-printing and psychological counselling services.
近日在一些直播平台上，很多从事艺术培训的名师们做起了公益性直播，尝试为疫情下的线下艺术培训机构突破新的出口。
Recently, on some live broadcast platforms, many famous teachers engaged in art training have started to broadcast live to the public, trying to break through new outlets for the offline art training institutions under the epidemic.
依靠直播平台打赏勉强能有一些收入，但这也是只属于为一小部分人开的出口。
Rewarding on a live platform barely earns some income, but it is an outlet for only a fraction of the population.
“在网上做舞蹈类直播，做的比较好的都是一些很有名气的老师们。
"Dance live on the Internet, do better than some of the well-known teachers.
像我们这种普通机构，基本上做直播是没人看的，所以就是纯做公益。
Common institutions like ours, basically do live broadcast is no one to see, so it is purely pro bono.
而且线上课程几乎不赚钱，老师们都不愿意做。
And online classes are barely profitable, and teachers are reluctant to do it.
”丽娜谈道。
'she said.
这段时间，她只能通过会员群，鼓励会员们拍摄舞蹈视频进行打卡比赛送课，以此来调动积极性。
During this time, she can only encourage members through the group dance video card games to send class, as a way to mobilize enthusiasm.
但如果营业时间遥遥无期，恐怕这种方式也持续不了太久。
But if business hours are far away, I'm afraid it won't last long.
一些体培机构也采取了类似的打卡机制，“连续四天了，家长学生对打卡的热情都不高，这个时候非常难调动积极性。
Some body culture organizations have adopted a similar card printing mechanism, "for four days in a row, parents and students are not very enthusiastic about the card, this time very difficult to motivate.
”张峰说，疫情过后，可能会迎来一波小高峰，目前只能加油把疫情熬过去，但疫情什么时候结束还不知道。
'After the outbreak, there may be a wave of small peaks, 'Mr. Zhang said.' At the moment, we can only refuel to get the disease through, but it's unclear when the outbreak will end.
图 /视觉中国对于重线下服务的民营幼儿园，面对无法开园营业的现状，也只能积极探索线上教学的新模式。
Chart / Vision China can only actively explore the new mode of online teaching for private kindergartens that are unable to operate under the heavy line.
幼儿园面向的是3-6岁的低龄化用户，如何陪伴孩子是家长们的核心诉求。
Kindergartens are intended for younger users aged 3 to 6, and accompanying children is a core demand of parents.
“这段时间，我们给家长提供了一些心理咨询服务，结合前期研发的类似于美国版巧虎的线上产品，教会家长如何带孩子。
"During this time, we have provided parents with some counseling services to teach them how to take care of their children, using online products similar to the American version of the tiger developed earlier in the year.
“王应运说。
"said Wang Ying-yun.
但另一方面，他也对疫情发展有所担忧。
On the other hand, he has concerns about the spread of the epidemic.
如果幼儿园迟迟无法正常开学，并且在这段时间不能给予家长提供等值服务的话，很难保证家长不会要求减免学费。
It is difficult to ensure that parents do not ask for fee waivers if there are delays in the regular opening of kindergartens and if parents are not provided with equal services during this period.
“像音乐、美术、体育、舞蹈这些偏肢体运动的培训，纯线上是很难做到的。
"Training in partial body movements such as music, art, sports and dancing is hard to do online.
我们经过大量的实践验证了，孩子们在学习过程中，有一些肢体的动作，必须需要现场进行纠正和示范。
We have a lot of practice to verify that children in the learning process, there are some body movements, must be on the spot for correction and demonstration.
“乐斯教育创始人宫旭生说。
"said Miao Xusheng, founder of Leslie Education.
艺术类培训机构业务转线上，其实是一种应急方案，对于艺术培训行业，线下教育几乎很难找到线上的完整替代品。
The business of art training institutions is in fact a contingency plan, for the art training industry, offline education is almost impossible to find a complete online alternative.
他判断，疫情结束后线下教育会迎来一个短暂的爆发点。
He judged that after the end of the epidemic offline education will usher in a brief flashpoint.
现阶段，机构首先应该做好冬眠的准备，其次也得更多关注疫情结束后，业务如何复苏的问题。
At this stage, the organization should prepare for hibernation first, and pay more attention to how the business recovers after the outbreak.
军心难稳转型线上困难重重面临退费危机的，还有靠线下业务作为主力的少儿英语培训机构。
The army is difficult to transition the line of difficulties facing the cost recovery crisis, and rely on offline business as the main English training institutions for children.
“我们主打的线下一对一口语教学业务关停了，说服不了家长们以同样的价格转线上，好多都要求退费，我们这种小机构利润很薄，一旦停业不堪设想。
"Our off-line one-on-one oral education business is closed down, parents can't be persuaded to switch to the same price, many demand refund, our small institutions are very thin profit, once the closure of the envisaged.
而且机构里的外教们最近情绪也很不稳定，吵着喊着要回国。
And the foreign teachers in the institution have been in an unstable mood recently, clamoring to return home.
“某地方K12英语培训机构的负责人刘雯告诉燃财经。
"Liu Wen, head of a local K12 English training institute, told Flaming Finance.
一些涉外培训机构的外教们陷入了左右为难。
Some foreign teachers in foreign training institutions are in a dilemma.
如果机构无法保证收入，外教们接下来的去留也是难题。
If institutions cannot guarantee income, it is difficult for foreign teachers to stay.
“作为全英文授课的国际园所，我们一共有80多名外教，外教们现在其实很纠结。
"We have more than 80 foreign teachers as part of the international park, which teaches in all English.
疫情发生后，一些外教情绪比较激动，一方面比较担心安全问题，但另一方面更担心自己的就业问题。
After the outbreak, some foreign teachers are more excited, on the one hand, more worried about security, but on the other hand more worried about their own employment.
而且就算现在回到自己国家，也不太好找工作，回国之后还会被隔离起来。
And it's not easy to find a job if you go back to your home country, and you're going to be quarantined.
“ 王应运谈道，”好在我们机构短期内还比较稳定，不会影响到外教们的正常收入。
"Wang Yingyun said," Fortunately our organization is relatively stable in the short term, will not affect the normal income of foreign teachers.
“这场未知的“战疫”到底什么时候结束，尚无定论，但给企业带来的危机是有目共睹的。
"It is not certain when this unknown" plague "will end, but the crisis for companies is clear.
“疫情不知道什么时候才能控制住，房租、老师们的工资开销都是问题。
"We don't know when we will be able to bring this under control," he said.
线下课程多数被叫停了，线上课程客单价较低，竞争也非常大，纯靠线上业务很难维持生存，每天还要处理各种退费，让人焦头烂额。
Most offline courses have been called off, online course users have low unit prices and competition is so great that it is hard to keep afloat on-line, and they have to deal with all sorts of rebates every day.
“刘雯说。
"said Liu Wen.
受疫情影响，教育部发布《关于2020年春季学期延期开学的通知》，同时各省市逐步叫停寒假线下课外培训。
Affected by the epidemic, the Ministry of Education issued a circular on the extension of the start of the spring term 2020, while provinces and municipalities gradually suspended off-line extra-curricular training.
各大教培机构纷纷将业务搬到线上，线上教育迎来了转机，但中小机构的日子依旧不好过，资源流量倾向头部机构，一些在线教育腰部机构普遍产生了获客焦虑。
While online education has taken a turn for the better, small and medium-sized organizations continue to struggle, with resource flows tilting toward the head, and some online education loins are prone to anxiety.
图 / Pexels“在线教育太烧钱了，线上获客成本高，是在线教育面临的最大问题，我们用了四五年的时间，花了几千万才打磨出现在线上的这套产品。
It took us four or five years, tens of millions of dollars, to polish the online version of the product, which is the biggest problem facing online education.
”王应运告诉燃财经。
Wang Yingyun told Flaming Finance.
在线教育获客成本高是行业的最大痛点，而在线教育机构的获客途径，大多是通过广告投放和销售转化来完成。
The high cost of online education is the biggest pain point of the industry, and the online educational institutions are mostly through advertising and sales transformation to complete.
新东方在线发布的2019年中报显示，其获客成本虽然要低于行业内水平，但销售费用却还是上涨了25%。
According to New Oriental Online's Mid-2019 newspaper, the cost of getting customers is 25% higher than it would be in the industry.
而根据好未来2020年财年Q3财报，好未来的销售和营销费用同比增长87.6%，主要由于线上业务的营销费用增加。
And, according to the Q3 results for the next fiscal year 2020, future sales and marketing costs are up 87.6% year-on-year, largely because of higher marketing costs for the online business.
此前在2019年中，好未来的专家电话会中，曾提到好未来的获客成本达1300元，相比2018年增长了18%。
Earlier, in mid-2019, the Good Future's expert phone conference mentioned that the cost of getting a good future was $1,300, an increase of 18% over 2018.
此外，作为唯一一支实现正向盈利的，在美上市的在线教育中概股跟谁学，虽然在其2019年三季度财报电话会中，披露其2019年累计三季度获客成本仅为545元，低于行业水平，但也不容乐观。
Moreover, as the only US-listed online education company that has achieved positive returns, the company learned from whom, although in its 2019 third-quarter earnings call, it disclosed that its 2019 cumulative third-quarter customer cost was only 545 yuan, lower than the industry level, but not optimistic.
跟谁学披露，其采取的计算方式为用Non-GAAP销售费用(5.95亿元)除以付费课程人数。
To whom the disclosure was made, it was calculated by dividing the cost of selling non-GAAP ($595 million) by the number of paying course participants.
这种算法仅是一种粗略的计算，忽略了公司获客所需时长、真实新课人数、以及支持获取新客的所有人力和财力的支出等因素。
The algorithm is a crude calculation that ignores factors such as the length of time a company takes to get visitors, the number of real new classes, and the expense of all the human and financial resources needed to support new customers.
巨头们依旧在打烧钱战，中小型在线教育机构仍在泥潭中挣扎。
Big companies are still fighting money wars, and small and medium-sized online educational institutions are still struggling.
在线教育虽多次成为所谓风口行业，但也一度不被看好。
Although online education has become the so-called tuyere industry for many times, it was not popular at one time.
受此次新冠肺炎疫情影响，教育部叫停线下培训机构，对于一些被迫将业务转到线上的传统线下教学机构，无疑是雪上加霜。
The Ministry of Education has called for off-line training institutions affected by the outbreak to add to the pressure on some of the traditional offline institutions forced to move their businesses online.
但危机也伴随着机遇，随着“停课不停学”的政策一出，头部在线教育机构们纷纷嗅到了“潜在流量”的味道。
But the crisis has also been accompanied by opportunities, with online head-to-head educational institutions sniffing out the "potential flow" as the "no-go-to-learn" policy emerges.
逆势扩张黄金期在线教育迎来机遇针对疫情对高校正常开学和课程教学造成的影响，教育部目前印发了相关指导意见，要求采取政府主导、高校主体、社会参与的方式，共同实施并保障高校在疫情防控期间的在线教学，实现“停课不停教、停课不停学”。
In response to the impact of the epidemic on the normal opening of colleges and universities and the teaching of curricula, the Ministry of Education has issued guidance on how to jointly implement and guarantee online teaching in colleges and universities during the period of disease prevention and control, so as to achieve "non-stop teaching and non-stop learning."
截至2月2日，教育部组织22个在线课程平台免费开放在线课程2.4万余门，覆盖了本科12个学科门类，专科高职18个专业大类。
As of February 2, the Ministry of Education has organized 22 online courses platforms to open more than 24,000 online courses free of charge, covering 12 undergraduate disciplines and 18 major specialties in specialized higher education.
资本市场大受政策鼓舞，A股开市以来，在线教育股二六三、三盛教育、和晶科技、世纪天鸿等逾十只个股多日涨停，股价持续走高。
Capital markets have been encouraged by policies, with more than a dozen stocks, including online education stocks 26.3, Samsung Education, Hejing Technologies and Century Tian Hon, trading higher since the start of the A share market.
为响应“停课不停学”的政策，在线教育机构纷纷推出免费线上课程。
In response to the "no-stop-learning" policy, online educational institutions have introduced free online courses.
新东方、好未来、网易有道、跟谁学、51Talk、VIPKID等一些头部在线教育机构纷纷慷慨捐资、成立专项基金、向全国范围内的中小学生提供免费的在线教育课程，向一些学校机构免费提供技术输出。
New Oriental, Good Future, Netease Road, with whom to learn, 51 Talk, VIPKID and other online educational institutions generously donated funds, set up special funds, provided free online education courses to primary and secondary school students nationwide, and provided free technical outputs to some school institutions.
这些举动也提升了美股和港股资本信心，近日好未来、新东方、跟谁学、朴新教育等股价均有不同程度上涨。
The moves also boosted U.S. and Hong Kong stocks' capital confidence, with share prices rising to varying degrees in recent days for the future, New Oriental, with whom to learn, and Park Xin Education.
疫情催熟了在线教育行业发展，在“停课不停学”的政策指向下，在线教育逐步渗透到更多家长和学生心中。
The epidemic has accelerated the development of online education industry, under the policy of "non-stop learning" policy, online education gradually infiltrate more parents and students.
相关业内人士分析，头部教育机构在向全国中小学生免费开放平台，将在线教育的概念沉了下去，家长和学生们在疫情的影响下，只能通过在线形式进行学习。
Related industry analysis, head education institutions in the country's primary and secondary school students free open platform, the concept of online education sank down, parents and students under the impact of the epidemic, can only learn online.
对于在线教育来说有一定的推动作用，在线教育迎来了崛起和弯道超车的历史时刻。
For online education, there is a certain role to promote online education, online education ushered in the rise and curve overtaking of the historic moment.
图 / Pexels创新工场合伙人张丽君提到，疫情会加速用户对线上教育的认知，线上教育的渗透率会在短时间内大幅提升，获取用户的转化率也会短时间内提升，获客成本短期内会降低一小段时间之后再恢复。
'The epidemic will accelerate users' perception of online education, 'says Zhang Lijun, a partner at Innovation Works in Graphics / Pexels.' Penetration rates for online education will increase dramatically in a short time, access to users will improve in a short time, and the cost of customers will be reduced for a short time before recovering.
蓝象资本创始合伙人宁波宇建议道，疫情之下教育行业创始人要做路径创新，不要在自己具备核心优势的点上做改变；初创团队一定要计算好现金流，最大程度保障公司的核心团队，及时沟通解决协商方案；有部分创始人可考虑提前启动下一轮融资计划，不必过度纠结估值；穷尽所有手段，寻求股东帮助。
Ningbo Yu, founder partner of Blue Elephant Capital, suggests that the founders of the education industry should innovate in the path of the epidemic and not change where they have a core advantage; start-up teams must calculate cash flow, maximize core company teams and communicate and negotiate solutions in a timely manner; some founders can consider launching the next round of financing ahead of schedule without undue entanglement in valuations; and exhaust all means to seek shareholder help.
