作者 | 黎明编辑 | 魏佳果农周金桥做好最悲观的打算：脐橙要是卖不出去，就把城里的房子卖了。
Rain & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & #
总得活着。
Always live.
他生活了近50年的秭归县牛岭村，随着湖北省，成了中国新冠病毒疫情版图上颜色最深的那一块。
He lived for nearly 50 years in the village of Niuling, Zigui county, and with Hubei Province became the most colored section of the Chinese New Crown virus epidemic.
疫区转眼成了禁区，上万斤成熟的脐橙即将烂在地里，卖不出去。
Epidemic areas have become a forbidden area, tens of thousands of mature umbilical orange soon rotten in the field, can not be sold.
周金桥身后，15万秭归果农，超过17万吨脐橙，都面临同样境遇。
After Zhou Jinqiao, 150,000 Zigui fruit farmers, more than 170,000 tons of umbilical orange, faced the same situation.
扩大种植面积、赚钱、买房、过上和城里人一样的生活，这些大家平时口口相传的心愿，如今也被戴上的口罩掩盖。
Widening acreage, making money, buying a house, and living the life of a city dweller are now covered up with masks, as is often the custom.
当地政府也陷入两难：让果农和工人复工能暂时化解危机，但会增加防疫压力；更重要的是，通往外界的交通阻断，即便复工了，橙子也运不出去。
The local government is also in a dilemma: getting growers and workers back to work will ease the crisis temporarily, but it will increase the pressure to prevent disease; more importantly, traffic to the outside world will be cut off, and oranges will not get out, even if work resumes.
秭归脐橙的供应链全部断裂。
The supply chain of Zigui umbilical oranges was completely disrupted.
大家必须面对一个矛盾的选择题：眼下的生命重要，可未来的生活呢？李发山的脐橙已经通过阿里巴巴卖出三分之一直到有一天，一辆辆收购脐橙的货车停在山野的路边，阿里巴巴牵头修复了这条供应链。
You have to face a paradoxical choice: life is important now, but what about the future? Li's umbilical orange has been sold through Alibaba for a third until one day a truck buying umbilical oranges stops by the side of the mountain and Alibaba leads the effort to fix the supply chain.
这个春天，如果你吃到了来自湖北秭归的脐橙，也顺便了解一下这些脐橙背后的故事。
This spring, if you have eaten the umbilical orange from Zigui, Hubei, you will also know the story behind these oranges.
生命与生计“卖不掉脐橙，就卖房吧”过完大年初六，果农李发山突然意识到与往年的不同。
Life and livelihood "can not sell the navel orange, on the bar," after the end of the sixth, fruit grower Li Fa Shan suddenly realized the difference with previous years.
“往年春节，脐橙客商的拜年电话响个不停。
"Normally, during Spring Festival, umbilical orange merchants keep ringing their New Year calls.
最近几年市场形势好，很多商贩春节期间就来提前订货。
In recent years, the market situation is good, many peddlers come to order in advance during Spring Festival.
”今年春节，他的电话异常安静。
His phone call was unusually quiet this Spring Festival.
主动联系一个经常合作的客商，“什么时候能来收脐橙？”对方回复，“我敢收，你敢摘吗？”对病毒的恐惧笼罩在每个人的心头。
Proactive contact with a regular business, "When can I receive umbilical orange?" The other side replied, "Do you dare to pick it?" Fear of the virus hangs over everyone's mind.
能在家就不出屋吧，活过这个冬天。
You can stay at home and stay in the house for the winter.
1月23日，武汉封城，随后，疫情蔓延，整个湖北成为“禁区”。
January 23, Wuhan closed the city, then, the spread of the epidemic, the entire Hubei into a "prohibited area."
截至昨天，他们所在的宜昌市累计确诊有931例，这个数字接近江西全省确诊的数据。
As of yesterday, their city of Yichang cumulative diagnosis 931 cases, this figure is close to Jiangxi Province confirmed data.
李发山的村子大路小路都封了，农民下果园也得办证。
The main roads and paths in Li Fat Shan's village were sealed and the farmers had to obtain a certificate to go to the orchard.
2月4日，立春，农民们开始慌了：度过这个冬天，接下来怎么生活？“站在门前，看着漫山的橙子熟了，心里甜蜜蜜的。
On February 4, Li Chun, the farmers began to panic: how to spend the winter, how to live? "Stand in front of the door, watching the orange full of ripe, sweet heart.
但今年，看着闹心。
But this year, it looked disconcerting.
”李发山说。
'he said.
有时候，李发山焦虑到极点，想半夜溜出去，看看果子在树上还能撑多久。
Sometimes Li Fat Shan is so anxious that he wants to sneak out in the middle of the night to see how long the fruit will stay in the tree.
有一次，他半夜一点多起床，走到村口又回来了，“担心看到落的果子多，更焦心。
Once he got up at one o'clock in the middle of the night and returned at the beginning of the village.
”周金桥也经常失眠，等电话的过程漫长而煎熬，“给客商发去信息，没回音，一直等，一直等，有时候眼睛睁到天亮。
"Zhou Jinqiao also often insomnia, waiting for the long and torment of the telephone process," to send customers information, no response, has been waiting, waiting, sometimes eyes open until dawn.
”李发山算了笔账，脐橙卖不出去，得损失20万，更担心的是，秭归脐橙消失一年，明年谁还认？周金桥也做好了最坏的打算，“脐橙如果卖不出去，就把城里房子卖了，养活一家人。
"Li Fashan calculated the score, umbilical orange sales, lost 200,000, more worrying, Zigui navel orange disappeared for a year, who next year also recognized?" Zhou Jinqiao also prepared for the worst, "if not sold, the city house will be sold to feed a family.
”秭归的农民大多以种脐橙为生，这里地处湖北省西部，位于三峡大坝库首，三峡库区蓄水后，周围温度降低，形成一个天然的冰箱，每年9月至次年4月，农民都有果实卖，这才有了首个“中国脐橙之乡”。
Most Zigui farmers earn their living growing umbilical oranges. Located in the western part of Hubei province, at the head of the Three Gorges Dam reservoir, the water storage in the Three Gorges Reservoir area reduces the temperature surrounding the area and forms a natural refrigerator.
三峡移民，举世关注。
Three Gorges immigrants, the world attention.
在秭归人世世代代的生活里，与树共生，与草枯荣。
In the life of Zigui people from generation to generation, they lived symbiotically with the trees and withering grass.
二十多年前，很多农民要搬到水位线175米以上的新居，舍不得脐橙树，很多果农像周金桥一样，拉着土，扛着树，爬坡走山路。
More than 20 years ago, many farmers had to move to their new homes more than 175 meters above the water level. They were reluctant to give up the navel orange trees.
有人两棵两棵地搬，5公里的旧舍与新居，硬是来回走了3000公里。
Two-man-to-two, five-kilometer-old cottages and new homes, had walked 3,000 kilometers back and forth.
20年前，秭归移民将脐橙移栽到新的家园脐橙树也没辜负村里人。
Twenty years ago, Zigui settlers transplanted umbilical oranges into their new homes.
周金桥家从年收入不到2万元，到现在的20万。
Zhou Jinqiao family annual income from less than 20,000 yuan, to the present 200, 000.
盖起了几间屋，娶了媳妇，还在县城买了房。
Built several rooms, married a daughter-in-law, but also bought a house in the county.
他所在的牛岭村，近500户人家都靠树致富。
In his village of Niuling, nearly 500 families have become rich from trees.
生活的规划被疫情打破，不能光顾着眼下的生存，还要抬眼看看以后的生活。
Life planning was broken by the epidemic, can not patronize the current survival, but also look up to see the future of life.
农民们曾试着和商家一起打破这种阻隔。
Farmers have tried to break down this barrier with businesses.
“最初，车根本出不了湖北，后来秭归政府支持农产品出去，可运农产品的车出了湖北，到了外省，也下不了高速。
"Initially, the vehicles could not leave Hubei at all. Later, the Government of Zigui supported the release of agricultural products, and the vehicles carrying agricultural products travelled out of Hubei Province, where they could not get off the expressway.
线下渠道走不通。
The offline channels are blocked.
”一位湖南的客商跟周金桥想办法，“大车出不去，就快递发货，一件一件寄。
"Hunan merchants and Zhou Jinqiao to find a way," big cars can not get out, express delivery, one piece at a time.
”但货到客商手里，烂了三分之一。
"But the merchant lost a third of his strength.
现在的秭归脐橙成熟度较高，以前三天寄到的货，如今穿越层层关卡，要一周。
Today, Zigui has a high level of umbilical orange maturity, and the previous three days of shipments have now passed through layers of posts that take a week.
路上，脐橙不断烂掉。
On the way, umbilical oranges kept rotting.
无计可施，无路可走。
Nothing can be done.
利与义“这是大义”朱道鹏是宜昌誉福天下公司总经理，这位水果服务商也在等电话。
"This is big justice" Zhu Daopeng is the general manager of Yichang Yufu World Company, the fruit service provider is also waiting for the call.
家在深圳，他本可以回家过年。
Home in Shenzhen, he could have been home for the New Year.
那时湖北省还没封闭，但湖北成重灾区的消息早已传遍。
Hubei Province was not closed at that time, but the news of the serious disaster areas in Hubei has been spread.
在去往火车站的路上，他半路又折回了宜昌。
Halfway to the railway station, he turned back to Yichang.
“放不下公司300多名员工，上千户果农肯定也都在等着我。
"There are more than 300 employees in the company and thousands of fruit farmers are definitely waiting for me.
”朱道鹏的公司创办8年，核心产品是秭归脐橙，通过阿里巴巴电商平台，将超过百万吨脐橙卖到全国各地。
Zhu's company was founded eight years ago and its core product is the umbilical orange of Zigui, which is sold throughout the country through the Alibaba electric business platform, which sells more than one million tons of umbilical orange.
跟着他种植脐橙的农户，种植面积也从原来的两亩、五亩，变成二三十亩……有人从万元户变成了百万富翁。
With his umbilical orange farmers, planting area from the original two mu, five mu, into 20 and 30 mu...... someone has become a millionaire.
八年来，朱道鹏将秭归脐橙卖到全国各地他、公司和农民一起“起来了”。
For eight years, Zhu Daopeng sold Zigui umbilical oranges all over the country. He, the company and the peasants "got up together."
他对秭归，对这些农民都有了感情。
He had a feeling for Zigui and for those peasants.
“往年过了初六是开工的日子，但今年初六，是疫情蔓延凶猛的时候，眼见着开工遥遥无期，年前收购近万斤脐橙在仓库里都无法加工，更别说去农户家收购新货了。
"In the past six years, we started work, but on the sixth day of this year, when the epidemic spread, we could not see the start of construction.
”听到电话铃声，他就知道是农户的，“其实谁也没有办法，但得接，（农户）给我打电话，只是要点希望。
"Hearing the telephone ring, he knew it was the farmer's." There was really nothing anyone could do, but he had to answer it and give me a call.
”朱道鹏总是告诉他们：“我在想办法，快了。
Zhu Daopeng always tells them, "I'm trying to figure something out, fast.
”盘了一下眼前的困难，物流不通、人员无法流动、不能开工、品控机构找不到，即便以上问题都解决了，谁来卖？谁来买？他自己都走不出小区，又怎么能将万吨脐橙送出湖北？直到宜昌内可以办证出入，他实在忍不住了，开车去农户果园，从家上高速不到五公里，走了1小时，过了十几道关卡。
After all these problems were solved, who would sell them? Who would buy them? How could he send them out of Hubei? He couldn't help but drive to the farmers' orchard less than five kilometers from home for an hour past a dozen checkpoints.
2月6日，他看到一条新闻，阿里巴巴大农业办公室发布“爱心助农”计划，尽全力解决全国多地农产品滞销的难题。
On February 6, he saw news that Alibaba's big agricultural office was doing all it could to solve the problem of unmarketable farm produce in many parts of the country.
“转机来了。
"The turning point is here.
”同样看见转机的，还有邓秀新院士。
In the same vein, there was Professor Deng Xiuxin.
邓秀新，中国工程院副院长，被称为“脐橙院士”，他最近非常着急，他知道疫情的阻隔对于中国农业的伤害。
Deng Xiuxin, a vice-dean at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, known as the "umbilical orange academician," has been worried recently about the damage to Chinese agriculture caused by the outbreak.
不光是脐橙，现在两端告急，地里的好农货走不出去，消费者买的蔬菜不新鲜。
Not only umbilical orange, now two ends of the crisis, the good farm products in the field can not go out, consumers buy vegetables not fresh.
2003年，邓秀新（右）陪同前世界柑桔学会主席阿尔布里哥调研秭归脐橙2月17日，经中国农业农村部牵头，由邓秀新领衔的全国农业领域30位院士、首席科学家联手阿里巴巴启动“爱心助农计划”，把产销这条赖以生存的供应链接上。
In 2003, Deng Xiuxin (right) accompanied former President of the World Citrus Institute Albrigo to investigate Zigui's umbilical cord orange on February 17. Led by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of China, 30 academicians and chief scientists in the field of agriculture led by Deng Xiuxin have joined forces with Alibaba to launch the "love-farming project," which links the supply chain on which production and marketing depend.
这个时候，自己早已经不想着什么院士，更多是“愿士”，邓秀新说，这时候就应该是志愿者，这是大义。
At this time, oneself already did not think of what academician, more is "wish person", Deng Xiuxin says, this time should be a volunteer, this is Dayi.
他的手机在疫情期间也被打爆了。
His cell phone was also blown up during the outbreak.
“我对秭归有特殊的感情。
"I have a special feeling for Zigui.
这里凝结着我们几代柑橘专家的心血。
It's the work of generations of citrus experts.
”从2008年开始，他曾多次实地调查，也是他在当地推广“晚采”技术，保证果农半年都有果实卖。
Since 2008, he has conducted field surveys on several occasions, and it was he who promoted "late-mining" techniques locally to ensure that growers sold fruit for half a year.
在秭归，许多果农都有邓秀新的手机号码，“疫情我们信钟南山院士，柑橘我们信邓秀新院士。
In Zigui, many fruit farmers have Dengxiu new mobile phone numbers, "epidemic we believe in Academician Zhong Nan Shan, citrus we Xin Deng Xiuxin Academician.
”邓秀新院士提前判断阿里巴巴在非常时刻进入秭归的意义，“去年秭归脐橙通过网购脐橙销售达到9万多吨，占整个产量的15%-20%。
"Deeng Xiuxin, academician, judged in advance the significance of the entry of Alibaba into Zigui at an extraordinary time." Last year, Zigui saw the online purchase of more than 90,000 tons of umbilical orange sales, accounting for 15 to 20 per cent of the total production.
疫情的形势在逐渐好转，到了脐橙大量上市的4月份，只要一放开采摘，然后通过网购，效果会很好。
The situation is gradually improving, to the umbilical orange market in April, as long as a release of pick, and then through the Internet purchase, the effect will be very good.
”当地政府也看到了转机，2月20日，秭归县农业农村局向阿里巴巴发函，正式邀请他们来秭归支援。
The local authorities also saw a turnaround, and on 20 February Zigui county agricultural and rural authorities sent a letter to Alibaba formally inviting them to come to Zigui for support.
杭州的电话也来了。
There's a phone call from Hangzhou, too.
“定了！阿里巴巴要和秭归政府一起，为秭归脐橙打造一条应急的数字供应链，希望您能一起参与、帮忙。
"Dedicated! Alibaba and Zigui Government to work together to create an emergency digital supply chain for Zigui umbilical orange, I hope you can participate and help together.
”朱道鹏接到电话后，说了不知道多少个“好”。
Zhu Daopeng received the call and said he did not know how many "good."
商人，做生意、获利才是根本。
Businessman, business, profit is the fundamental.
但朱道鹏看着视频中那些捐款，那些逆行者，“必须做贡献，尽我所能。
But Zhu Daopeng looks at the donations in the video, and those who do the reverse, "have to contribute, do my best."
为自己，也为大家。
For yourself and for everyone.
”原则与突破“你就告诉我能不能落？”要命的问题摆在眼前：怎么运？谁来买？质量怎么保证？其实直指供应链的三个核心：物流、销售、品控。
Principle and Breakthrough "Can you tell me if I can?" The fateful question is: How to luck? Who will buy? How to guarantee quality? In fact, it refers to the three core of the supply chain: logistics, sales, and quality control.
也有好消息：2月29日，湖北省首次发布新冠肺炎疫情风险等级评估报告，秭归被列为11个低风险县（市、区）之一。
There is also good news: on 29 February, Hubei Province issued its first risk assessment report for the outbreak of new crown pneumonia, and Zigui was listed as one of 11 low-risk counties (cities and districts).
秭归县各级政府开始指导复工，农民与商家可以去地里和工厂采摘、分选与包装，但不能超过15人，且要严格做好防护。
The Government of Zigui county at various levels has begun to guide the resumption of work, and farmers and businesses may go to the fields and factories to pick, sort and package, but not more than 15 persons, and shall strictly protect themselves.
虽然和以前的场景没法比，但这至少算特殊时期的“天时”。
Although not comparable to the previous scene, but this is at least a special period of "time."
地利是，秭归是湖北省电商化水平最高的县域之一。
Zigui was one of the counties in Hubei Province with the highest level of commercialized electricity.
。
.
阿里巴巴数字农业秭归脐橙标准化示范种植基地2018年，阿里在秭归建立了首个“未来农场”，后来改为数字农业基地。
Alibaba digital agriculture Zigui navel orange standardized demonstration planting base In 2018, Ali established the first "future farm" in Zigui, which was later transformed into a digital agricultural base.
据秭归县农业农村局数据，同年，有1592家电商通过阿里销售秭归脐橙，秭归脐橙单品销售问鼎全国第一。
According to data from the Agricultural and Rural Bureau of Zigui county, in the same year 1,592 electrical vendors sold Zigui umbilical oranges through Ali, and Zigui was the country's top seller of umbilical orange singles.
数字化的供应链在当地有比较深厚的积淀。
The digital supply chain has deep accumulation in the local area.
解救秭归脐橙，阿里巴巴决定先把品控关：品质才是财富。
Rescue Zigui umbilical orange, Alibaba decided to control the first product: quality is wealth.
不能坏了秭归的名，更不能伤了消费者的心。
Zigui cannot break the name of Zigui, not to mention hurt the hearts of consumers.
不能人员聚集，启动“云品控”+“异地加工”。
Can not gather people, start "cloud control" + "off-site processing."
云品控，就是农户采摘、装车、进入工厂，全程由钉钉视频监控。
Cloud control, that is, farmers picking, loading cars, into the factory, the entire process by nail video monitoring.
在现场，水果直径测量圈用来测试果径大小，果皮光滑度及瑕疵视频里肉眼可见，糖度测试仪会跟现在的体温测试仪一样，放在脐橙旁边就能直接显示甜度。
At the site, the fruit diameter measuring ring is used to measure the diameter, skin smoothness and blemishes. The sugar tester is placed next to the umbilical orange to show the sweetness to the naked eye, as is currently the case with temperature testers.
一旦发现异常，视频里会叫停核查。
Once an exception is found, the video stops checking.
除云品控之外，随机抽检的脐橙，还被快递至阿里数字农业事业部品控中心，由阿里巴巴和第三方专业品控机构来做二次抽检。
In addition to cloud control, random sampling of the umbilical orange, also express to Ali Digital Agricultural Enterprise Quality Control Center, Alibaba and a third-party professional quality control agency to do a second sampling.
为防控疫情作保障，初期筛查过的果子，会在异地加工、分选，果径大小不同，分级就不同，果径大的卖价高，农民收入也能更高。
In order to prevent and control the disease, the fruits are processed and sorted in different places, with different diameters, different grades, high prices for large fruit diameters and higher incomes for farmers.
朱道鹏承担了异地加工的重任，为了争取时间，他放弃了宜昌的加工厂，在当地的郭家坝镇新租了两个厂房，就在当地招工，招不来，就加工资。
Zhu Daopeng shouldered the heavy responsibility of processing in different places, in order to gain time, he gave up Yichang processing plant, in the local town of Guo Jiaba newly rented two factories, on the local recruitment, on wage increases.
另外，他还新增了防护服、口罩、消毒液等防护设备，“整个运营成本高出60%。
In addition, he added protective clothing, masks, disinfectant and other protective equipment, "the overall operating cost is 60 percent higher.
”“通过科学防疫，严格品控，湖北出来的水果是安全的，放心吃。
"" Through scientific epidemic prevention, strict quality control, Hubei out of the fruit is safe, safe to eat.
” 对于网络流传的湖北水果带病毒的担心，邓秀新院士表示，多地暂停物流，只是担心通过运输水果的人携带病毒。
In response to concerns about the spread of the virus in Hubei Province, academicians Deng said many of the stops were for fear that people transporting fruit would carry the virus.
并不是水果或农产品本身的问题。
It is not a question of fruit or agricultural products per se.
阿里巴巴内部，大农业办公室调集一切可以协调的力量，解决“谁来买”的问题。
Inside Alibaba, the Grand Agricultural Office mobilizes all the forces it can coordinate to solve the "who buys" problem.
淘宝、天猫、聚划算、数字农业事业部、盒马、菜鸟……一位员工回忆，那种气氛，无异于参加一场战斗，各个群的钉钉声响成一片。
Taobao, cats, bargain, digital agriculture business, box horse, rookie... an employee recalled, that atmosphere, like taking part in a battle, groups of nails into a sound.
电话里说得最多的一句话是“特事特办”。
One of the most frequently spoken words on the phone is "Special Office."
滞销情况紧急，还真起了火药味，一位员工对同事说：“困难多大家都知道，你就告诉我（这些脐橙）能不能落（地）？”电话那端停顿了五秒钟，“能！”公司与公私建起湖北省第一条应急数字化供应链盒马接了，菜鸟也来了。
"You know, just tell me [these umbilical oranges] can you tell me if [these umbilical oranges] can fall?" The company stopped for five seconds and set up the first emergency digital supply chain box in Hubei Province with public and private companies.
李发山的内心感觉暖和了许多，橙子能采摘加工了，他一直犯愁的物流这块巨石，总算是在心里落了地。
Li Fat Shan heart feel a lot warmer, orange can pick processing, he has been worried about the logistics of this huge stone, is finally in the heart of the ground.
“一般的车根本进不了村，货车进村要经过十几道安检消毒，快递大部分也都还没恢复。
"Ordinary cars can not enter the village, trucks into the village to go through more than a dozen security checks, the majority of express has not been restored.
”菜鸟联合当地商家、物流伙伴，与秭归政府一起为脐橙打造了一条出省绿色通道。
Together with local businesses and logistics partners, Zigui Government has created a provincial green passage for navel oranges.
2月底，李发山看到货车呼呼地进村了，有的直接开到了当地加工厂，精包装的脐橙被快速装车。
At the end of February, Li Fat Shan saw trucks roaring into the village, some directly to the local processing plant, the refined packaging of the umbilical orange was quickly loaded.
数字农业事业部的员工协调商家，实行统一采购，他们告诉果农，“你们只需要用心采摘好橙子，剩下的事交给阿里巴巴。
The staff of the Ministry of Digital Agriculture coordinated the business and carried out uniform purchasing. They told the growers, "You just have to pluck the oranges carefully and leave the rest to Alibaba.
”成熟的秭归脐橙通过阿里巴巴数字农业供应链走向全国3月2日，首批8万多斤脐橙运出秭归。
The mature umbilical orange of Zigui went through the Alibaba digital agricultural supply chain to the country on March 2, and the first batch of more than 80,000 kilos of umbilical oranges was shipped out of Zigui.
首批订单中，阿里巴巴数字农业集采6万斤，盒马鲜生在武汉的18家门店集采2.4万斤。
The first batch of orders, Alibaba digital agricultural production of 60,000 jin, box horses rare in Wuhan 18 home stores to collect 24,000 jin.
打破重重阻隔，用时11天。
It took 11 days to break down the barriers.
李发山的20多亩脐橙，三天里卖掉三分之一，周金桥的脐橙也已经开始采摘出售，“再也不焦虑、失眠了。
Li Fat Shan's 20-acre umbilical orange, sold a third in three days, and Zhou Jinqiao's umbilical orange has also begun to be picked, "no more anxiety, insomnia.
”“感谢阿里巴巴，帮我们打通了疫情发生之后脐橙首次出省的通道。
"" Thank you, Alibaba, for helping us clear the way for the first time out of the province after the outbreak.
”秭归县县长杨勇表示。
Yangyong, county chief of Zigui county, said.
这也是阿里针对农产品，在湖北省打造的第一条应急数字化供应链。
This is also the first emergency digital supply chain that Ali created in Hubei province for agricultural products.
它的样本意义在于，疫情当下，在全国更多的地方，这种模式都可复制，可持续。
The significance of this model is that it is replicable and sustainable in more parts of the country.
中国物流学会特约研究员杨达卿认为，从采购、包装、储运、分销到末端配送的数字化供应链，全流程服务保障，能为秭归脐橙这类区域特色农产品走向大市场提供一条全新的高速公路。
According to Yang Daqing, a special research fellow at the China Logistics Institute, the digital supply chain, from procurement, packaging, storage and distribution to the end of distribution, and the provision of full-process service guarantees, can provide a new highway for Zigui's unique regional agricultural products, such as umbilical oranges, to the larger market.
“阿里作为开放性数字供应链平台，具有数字零售、数字金融、数字物流等全生态链的资源，利于把数字供应链的全链路协同做到最优化。
"As an open digital supply chain platform, Ali has the resources of digital retail, digital finance, digital logistics and other entire ecological chains, which is conducive to optimizing the whole links of the digital supply chain."
”据悉，包括物流在内的供应链成本主要由阿里巴巴承担，客商分摊一部分物流成本。
It is reported that the cost of the supply chain, including logistics, is borne mainly by Alibaba, with customers sharing some of the logistics costs.
为了支援秭归脐橙销售，这家公司选择放弃短期的商业利益。
To support the sale of navel oranges in Zigui, the company opted to forgo short-term commercial interests.
在2月的第四季度财报电话会议上，阿里巴巴CFO武卫介绍，“疫情对于三月份这个季度的影响有两方面，一是疫情直接的影响，二是我们给予商家的扶持和资助的项目。
"The impact of the outbreak on the March quarter was twofold," Alibaba CFO Wu said in a conference call in the fourth quarter of February.
”总体上看，疫情预计对下季度的营收造成负面影响。
Overall, the outbreak is expected to have a negative impact on revenue next quarter.
马云在阿里巴巴20周年年会上说，“阿里从20年前到现在，我们所有重要的决定都跟钱无关。
'From 20 years ago until now, all our important decisions have nothing to do with money, 'Mr. Ma said at Alibaba's 20th anniversary meeting.
我们都思考我们所做的决定，我们所投入的技术，我们所做的产品是否可以解决社会的问题。
We all consider whether the decisions we make, the technologies we invest in, and the products we make solve society's problems.
”大货车开远了，有农民朝货车挥手。
The big truck drove away and some farmers waved to it.
忙前忙后的朱道鹏感慨，不管冬天多阴冷，春天总会如期而至。
