记者/颜星悦编辑/石爱华 宋建华察里津诺残疾人康复中心大门受新冠肺炎疫情影响，俄罗斯首都莫斯科近日开始执行严格的防疫措施，并利用人脸识别技术对可能的感染者进行“监控”。
Reporter / Yan Xingyue Editor / Shi Aihua Song Jianhua Tsarizino Rehabilitation Center for the Disabled The Russian capital, Moscow, has recently implemented stringent preventive measures and used face-recognition technology to "monitor" potential infections.
从2月22日开始，莫斯科执法人员每天都会在地铁站、公交、甚至民宅中进行“突然检查”。
Starting on February 22, Moscow law enforcement officials carried out daily "surprise checks" at subway stations, on public transport and even in private homes.
截至目前，莫斯科已经确认88人违反隔离制度，其中80人是中国公民。
So far, 88 people, 80 of whom are Chinese citizens, have been confirmed to have violated the isolation regime in Moscow.
深一度记者了解到，这80位中国人多数在莫斯科东南部的察里津诺残疾人康复中心隔离，截至2月29日晚10点，察里津诺还滞留着70名左右中国人。
At one point, reporters learned that most of the 80 Chinese were quarantined at the Carizino Rehabilitation Center for the Handicapped in southeastern Moscow, where about 70 Chinese remained as of 10 p.m. on Feb. 29.
3月1日，中国驻俄罗斯大使馆发表声明称，目前80名涉嫌违反自我隔离规定的中国公民集中在察里津诺康复中心等指定地点进行隔离，使馆领事官员要求俄方采取一切措施提供良好的隔离和生活条件。
On March 1, the Chinese Embassy in Russia issued a statement saying that 80 Chinese citizens suspected of violating the self-segregation regulations were currently concentrated in designated places, such as the Carizino Rehabilitation Centre, and consular officials asked the Russian side to take all measures to provide good isolation and living conditions.
声明还提到，隔离点并非只有中国公民，还有俄公民和其他国家公民。
The statement also mentioned that the isolation points were not restricted to Chinese citizens, but also to Russian citizens and citizens of other countries.
北青深一度记者从中国驻俄罗斯大使馆确认了上述消息。
Beiqing Sheng once reporters from the Chinese Embassy in Russia confirmed the above information.
日前，深一度记者采访了数位当事人，他们还原了在莫斯科的经历，一部分人表示自己是在不知情的情况下“无意识”地违背了隔离法令，有人因为出门倒垃圾涉嫌违法，有人因为去超市买东西涉嫌违法，现在他们可能面临被驱逐出境，5年不得入境俄罗斯的处罚。
In a recent interview with several people, some of whom said they unknowingly and "unwittingly" violated segregation laws, others were suspected of breaking the law for taking out rubbish, others were suspected of having gone to the supermarket to buy something and now face deportation and a five-year ban from Russia.
从莫斯科机场入境时，需要签署“隔离书”，其中提到，隔离期间不能离开指定住所，多名采访对象表示在不懂俄文、不明白意思的情况下签了字（采访对象供图）出门倒垃圾被强制隔离张悦高中毕业后来到俄罗斯，至今已在这里学习、生活14年。
When entering Moscow airport, they were required to sign an "isolation protocol," in which they stated that they could not leave their designated residence during isolation. Several interviewees indicated that they had signed their names without knowing the Russian language and did not understand the meaning.
对她来说，俄罗斯就像第二个家。
For her, Russia is like a second home.
张悦和男朋友孟卓都是河南人，半年前，孟卓拿到俄罗斯学生签证，追随张悦来到俄罗斯。
Both Zhang Yue and her boyfriend Menjo, both from Henan province, followed Zhang to Russia six months ago with a Russian student visa.
2月18日，孟卓因需要回国递交身份证，从莫斯科飞到北京，2月19日早上，他到达首都国际机场T2航站楼。
On February 18, Mencius had to return home to submit his identity card, fly from Moscow to Beijing, February 19 morning, he arrived at the Capital International Airport T2 terminal.
在机场迅速办完事之后，孟卓立刻上飞机飞回莫斯科。
After a quick flight to the airport, Mondroid flew back to Moscow.
张悦说：“下飞机到上飞机，中间仅仅在首都机场停留了两个小时。
"I got off the plane and landed in the middle of it for only two hours," Zhang said.
”2月19日晚，孟卓到了莫斯科机场之后，海关登记了孟卓的住址和联系电话，并取了口腔、鼻腔黏膜样本。
"On the night of February 19, after arriving at Moscow airport, the customs service registered his address and telephone number and took samples of the oral and nasal mucosa.
之后，工作人员将一份俄文资料递交给孟卓，要求他签字。
The staff member then submitted a copy of the information in Russian to the Mondroid requesting his signature.
文件上没有中文翻译，工作人员也没有向他解释。
There was no Chinese translation on the document and the staff did not explain it to him.
签完文件，孟卓直接回了位于莫斯科市中心的家。
After signing the papers, Mondroid went straight back to his home in central Moscow.
因为朋友圈里充斥着“到处都在查中国人”的消息，回家后张悦和孟卓过上了居家隔离的生活，每天订外卖。
Because the circle of friends is full of "everywhere is looking at the Chinese" news, after returning home Zhang Yue and Meng Zhuo live in isolation, ordering take-out every day.
到了2月23日下午，家里的垃圾桶已经堆积成“山”，于是两人一起出门，走到离家10米的地方倒了垃圾，随后返回。
By the afternoon of February 23, the trash cans in the house had piled up into "mountains," so they went out together, walked 10 meters from home, emptied the rubbish, and then returned.
晚上8点左右，有人敲门，“因为20号的时候我接到检疫局电话，说会上门检查身体，我以为是检疫局的人。
At around 8 p.m., someone knocked at the door. "Because on the 20th I got a call from the Quarantine Office saying that the door was going to check on me.
”结果进来了三名警察，将所有房间巡视了一遍，接着要求查护照。
"Three policemen came in, inspected all the rooms, and then asked to see the passports.
张悦护照上最后一次到俄罗斯是4个月前，而孟卓的则是4天前。
Zhang Yue's passport was last in Russia four months ago, while Menzio's was four days ago.
看完护照之后，警察让张悦和孟卓跟他们走一趟，警车直接开进了警察局。
After reading the passport, the police let Zhang Yue and Menjo go with them. The police car drove straight into the police station.
大约40分钟后，警察过来给两人发了口罩，收走了护照，将他们带进一个玻璃房子里面，填写文件。
About 40 minutes later, the police came and took the two men masks, took their passports, took them into a glass house and filled out the documents.
过了一会儿，来了一男一女两位医生，他们给张悦和孟卓量了体温，检查了喉咙和胸腔。
After a while, there came a man and a woman. They took Zhang Yue and Meng Zhuo's temperature and examined their throats and chest cavity.
检查完之后，男医生向警察说：“这两个中国人没问题。
After the examination, the male doctor said to the policeman, "These two Chinese are all right.
”医生们走后约10分钟，警察把张悦的护照递还给她：“你可以走了，你男朋友暂时不能走。
About 10 minutes after the doctors left, the police returned Zhang Yue's passport to her: "You can go now, your boyfriend can't leave now.
他还没到14天，而且你们今天出去了。
He's not 14 days old, and you're out today.
”警察告诉张悦，他们开了“人脸识别系统”，发现了他们下午出了门。
Police told Zhang Yue they had switched on the face recognition system and found out they had left the house in the afternoon.
警察说孟卓必须去察里津诺庄园集中隔离，并让孟卓上车出发，张悦说：“他不会俄语，让我跟着去吧。
"He can't speak Russian," Zhang said. "Let me go with him.
”于是孟卓、张悦和三个警察再一次上了警车。
"So Menzio, Zhang Yue and three policemen got into the police car again.
到了察里津诺康复中心，警察把孟卓的护照和一些文件交给了穿着隔离服的工作人员，警察告诉张悦，孟卓14天后就能回家。
At the Tsarizino Rehabilitation Centre, the police handed Manteau's passport and some documents to a staff member in protective clothing, who told him that he would be able to return home in 14 days.
察里津诺残疾人康复中心房间内景实拍（采访对象供图）不要签，这是遣返的文件在隔离期间的事情，住在察里津诺康复中心315室的孙莹和214室的赵怀宝比张悦更清楚。
Tsarizino Rehabilitation Center for Persons with Disabilities room inside the scene (interview subject map) do not sign, this is the repatriation of documents during the isolation period, living in the Charizino Rehabilitation Center 315 Sun Ying and 214 room Zhao Huaibao more clear than Zhang Yue.
孙莹是四川人，在国内一所大学读大四，利用假期时间来俄罗斯玩，为了这次旅游，她筹划了8个月。
Sun Ying, a senior at a Chinese university, used her vacation time to play in Russia. She planned for the trip for eight months.
孙莹持有的是旅游签，她在2月11号晚上7:30抵达莫斯科，与孟卓不同的是，她入境的时候没有签“隔离通知书”。
Unlike Mondroid, who arrived in Moscow at 7: 30 p.m. on February 11 with a travel visa, Sun Ying did not sign a "quarantine notice" when she entered the country.
孙莹当晚就去了另一个机场，坐凌晨1点的飞机，去了摩尔曼斯克，在摩尔曼斯克以及圣彼得堡玩到21号才回到莫斯科，“隔离14天的法令是20号开始的，我完全不知道，也没有人通知我。
Sun Ying went to another airport that night, took a plane at 1 a.m., went to Murmansk, played in Murmansk and St. Petersburg until the 21st, and returned to Moscow. "The 14-day quarantine order started on the 20th and I didn't know it at all.
”2月23号下午4点多，孙莹坐地铁去机场，计划去贝加尔湖玩。
On February 23 at around 4 p.m., Sun Ying took the subway to the airport and planned to play in Lake Baikal.
地铁安检时，几个警察走过来要求她出示护照，看了眼护照后，警察示意孙莹跟他们走。
After checking the subway security, several policemen came to her and asked her to show her passport. After she looked at her passport, the policeman motioned Sun Ying to follow them.
孙莹用翻译软件问：“我怎么了？”警察告诉她：“你没满14天，需要医生来检测。
"What's the matter with me?" the policeman told her, "You don't have 14 days, you need a doctor to test it.
“30分钟后，医生来量了体温，取了口腔和鼻腔样本，拍了照片，然后让孙莹签署一份俄文文件。
"After 30 minutes, the doctor took the temperature, took the oral and nasal samples, took the pictures and made Sun sign a document in Russian
“这个文件就是后来入境的人在机场签的隔离通知书。
"This document is a quarantine notice signed at the airport by the incoming person.
”孙莹说，签完之后，警察收走文件，并放孙莹离开。
"After signing the papers, the police took them away and released Sun Ying.
孙莹坐上地铁，但她没想到很快又遇到了警察。
Sun Ying got on the subway, but she didn't expect to meet the police again soon.
坐了几站后，因为怕赶不上飞机，孙莹决定出站打车去机场。
After several stops, Sun Ying decided to take a taxi to the airport for fear of missing the plane.
下午6点左右，在出站口她被一个警察再次拦住，查看了护照后把她带到站内的警察亭。
At around 6 p.m., at the exit, she was again stopped by a policeman, checked her passport and took her to the police booth inside the station.
很快来了一个会说英语的医生，医生给孙莹检测过后告诉她：“跟警察走，没有关系的，需要过去住两天就可以了。
Soon there came an English-speaking doctor, who told Sun Ying after the exam: "It doesn't matter to go with the police. It only takes two days to live.
”于是孙莹在三个警察的看护下，再次坐上地铁到了红场附近的地铁站等待。
"So Sun Ying took the subway, under the supervision of three policemen, and waited at the subway station near Red Square.
直到晚上9点多，一辆警车来接孙莹，将她送到察里津诺康复中心。
Until more than 9 p.m., a police car came to meet Sun Ying and took her to the Tsarizino Rehabilitation Centre.
在一楼登记后她被带去了315房间，护照则被穿着防护服的工作人员收在一个透明的塑料袋里。
After registering on the first floor, she was taken to room 315, where her passport was kept in a transparent plastic bag by staff in protective clothing.
315房间有40平米左右，里面三张床，配有阳台和卫生间，浴室里洗浴用品齐全。
Room 315 is about 40 square meters, inside three beds, equipped with balconies and toilets, bathroom bathing supplies are complete.
当天晚上，护工还给孙莹送来了一些食物以及内裤袜子。
That night, the nurse also brought some food and panty socks to Sun Ying.
晚上躺在床上，孙莹还在盘算，两天后就可以继续自己的旅程。
At night, lying in bed, Sun Ying is still in the calculation, two days later can continue their journey.
孙莹告诉记者，中国驻俄使馆工作人员每天会来察里津诺送食品、水果等慰问品及生活必需品，“每天都有送吃的，还有一些插排插头、充电器，卫生用品，他也在群里征集大家需要的东西，然后送来。
Sun told reporters that Chinese embassy staff in Russia will come to inspect Zhenno every day to bring food, fruit and other comforts and necessities, "every day there are food, plug, charger, hygiene items, he also in the group to collect what you need, and then sent.
“直到2月26号，315新住进来一个大姐，把她加到一个名叫“察里津康复中心”的群里，她才知道事情没有那么简单。
"It was not until February 26, when a new sister-in-law, 315, added her to a group called the" Carizin Rehabilitation Center, "that she realized that the matter was not so simple.
“217房间的4个人下午被叫去签了‘认罪书’，我才知道等待我的是什么。
"Four people in room 217 were called in the afternoon to sign" guilty pleas, "and I knew what was waiting for me.
”第二天中午12点，护工在门口叫孙莹的名字，把孙莹单独带到一楼的一个房间里。
"The next day at 12 noon, the nurse called Sun Ying's name at the door, and took Sun Ying to a room on the ground floor alone.
一个穿防护服的男人，将一个文件和孙莹的护照放在她面前，示意她在文件上按手印。
A man in protective clothing put a document and Sun Ying's passport in front of her and motioned her to press her fingerprint on the document.
由于事先知道217房住户的遭遇，孙莹用翻译器问对方：“这个文件是什么内容？”对方回答：“是医院的文件，你必须签。
Knowing the fate of the 217 residents in advance, Sun Ying asked the interpreter, "What is this document?" The other party replied, "It is the hospital document, you must sign it.
”“我不懂文件上的俄语，可以翻译吗？”孙莹想用手机上的谷歌翻译软件，但对方告诉她说，不可以，并且用英文警告“NO Photo”。
"I don't know Russian on the document, can I translate it?" Sun Ying wanted to use Google Translate software on her mobile phone, but was told not to, and warned "NO Photo" in English.
对方看孙莹不签，拿起手机打电话。
The other side to see Sun Ying not signed, picked up the phone phone.
孙莹乘机拍了一张照片，发给中国驻俄罗斯大使馆的工作人员，使馆工作人员回复她：“不要签，这是遣返的文件。
Sun Ying took a photo and sent it to the staff of the Chinese Embassy in Russia, who replied to her, "Don't sign it. It's a repatriation document.
”左图为孙莹身上的墨渍，右图为网络审判，三人分别是被审判当事人、翻译和审判人员远程宣判要求10日内离境孙莹没有想到，接下来她会面临一场宣判。
Sun Ying left for the ink stains, right for the trial, three are the trial parties, interpreters and judicial officers to leave the country within 10 days of the request for a remote judgment Sun Ying did not think, and then she will face a sentence.
孙莹想让中国大使馆的工作人员跟对方沟通一下，电话打通后，孙莹请对方接听，但对方摆了摆手，拒绝接听。
Sun Ying wanted the staff of the Chinese Embassy to communicate with each other. After the call, Sun Ying asked the other party to answer the phone.
接着，对方又一次示意她按手印，孙莹再次打通大使馆的电话，问对方可不可以接一下。
Then, the other side again signaled her to press the fingerprint, Sun Ying again called the embassy to ask if the other side can answer.
这时，面前这位穿防护服的男人扯过孙莹的手机，争执中签字的油墨染到了孙莹身上。
At this time, the man in protective clothing pulled Sun Ying's mobile phone, the ink signed in the dispute dyed on Sun Ying.
最后对方抢过手机，按掉了电话，然后抓住孙莹的手，开始给她涂油墨。
Finally the other side grabbed the phone, pressed the phone, and then grabbed Sun Ying's hand, began to paint her ink.
最终，因为对方力气大，孙莹两只手的指纹、掌纹都按在了文件上。
In the end, because of the other side's strength, Sun Yingying's fingerprints and palms are pressed on the documents.
按完手印，护士带她去洗手的时候，孙莹哭了。
After pressing the fingerprint, the nurse took her to wash her hands. Sun Ying cried.
孙莹把身上的墨迹一一拍下来，发在群里，告诉大家她刚刚的经历。
Sun Ying took pictures of all the ink on her body and sent them to tell everyone about her experience.
接着孙莹被送回房间，直到下午5点左右，再一次被叫下去。
Then Sun Ying was sent back to her room until about 5 p.m. and was called down again.
“我被带到一台电脑前，屏幕上出现了三个画面，一个画面显示法官，一个画面显示我自己，还有一个显示翻译。
"I was taken to a computer and there were three pictures on the screen of a judge, a picture of myself, and a show translator.
”孙莹说，法官在一个看起来像是法庭的空间里，问一个问题，翻译翻一遍，再让她回答。
"Sun Ying said the judge asked a question in a space that looked like a courtroom, turned it over and asked her to answer it.
“先问我什么时候来的，然后叫什么名字，来俄罗斯干什么，”孙莹说，在这些确认身份的问题后，翻译的最后一个问题是：“你现在认不认同你触犯了我们的法律？“孙莹回答：“我不认。
"Ask me first when I came here, what was my name, and what I was doing in Russia," Sun Ying said. "After these status confirmation questions, the final question was:" Do you now recognize that you have violated our lawSun Ying replied, "I don't know.
”翻译说孙莹已经签署了隔离通知书，孙莹解释说：“我23号才知道隔离的事情，23号签的，签完我就被带到了这里。
"Sun Ying said that Sun Ying had signed the notice of separation." Sun Ying explained, "I only knew about the quarantine on the 23rd.
”法官听完解释后，让孙莹等他半个小时，然后走出了屏幕。
"After listening to the explanation, the judge asked Sun Ying to wait for half an hour and then left the screen.
半个小时后，法官再一次回到屏幕中，给孙莹下了判决，判定罚款5000卢布，10天内离境。
Half an hour later, the judge returned to the screen and sentenced Sun Yingying to pay a fine of 5,000 roubles and leave the country within 10 days.
孙莹听说了此前别人的经历，问法官：“我是不是5年以内都不可以来”，法官说，是的，5年以内你都不可以来“，法官同时告诉她，在拿到判决书后的10天内可以上诉。
When Sun Ying heard about other people's experiences before, she asked the judge, "Am I not allowed to come here for five years," the judge said. "Yes, you can't do that in five years.
北京时间2月28日晚孙莹告诉记者，她现在在等判决书。
Beijing time on the night of February 28 Sun Ying told reporters that she is now waiting for the verdict.
她害怕被送到派遣站，因为之前被送去的人发来的视频显示，那里的环境很差。
She was afraid of being sent to the station because videos from people who had previously been sent showed that the environment was very poor.
2月29日早上9点左右，深一度记者再次联系孙莹，已经联系不上。

张悦告诉记者，孙莹昨晚已被带走，手机已被没收。
Zhang Yue told reporters that Sun Ying had been taken away last night, the mobile phone has been confiscated.
有类似遭遇的还有49岁的东北人赵怀宝，他在俄罗斯打工，拿的是三年的工签，现在已工作一年，俄语只会听说，不会读写。
Zhao Huaibo, a 49-year-old northeastern who works in Russia for three years, has been working for a year and can only read and write Russian.
赵怀宝在老家过完年后，2月19号回到俄罗斯，签了俄语的隔离通知书。
After spending the next year in his hometown, Zhao returned to Russia on February 19th to sign a quarantine notice in Russian.
他被带到察里津诺的原因是去了超市买东西，经过和孟卓类似，都是警察上门。
The reason he was taken to Tsarizino was to go shopping at the supermarket, where, like Mondroid, the police came to him.
2月27日，下午四五点钟，护工把他带下楼，两个穿防护服的男人，让他在一份俄语文件上按手印，赵怀宝没有按，其中一个男人就抓着他的手腕，强迫他往上按。
On 27 February, at four or five p.m., the attendant took him downstairs and two men in protective clothing asked him to press his fingerprints on a Russian document. When Zhao Huaibo did not press it, one of the men grabbed him by the wrist and forced him to press up.
赵怀宝不同意，最终由于他的挣扎，还是没在文件上按手印。
Zhao Huaibao disagrees, because he finally struggles, still did not press fingerprint on the document.
然而第二天，赵怀宝仍然被远程宣判，罚款5000卢布，10天内离境，5年内不得入境俄罗斯。
The next day, however, Zhao was sentenced remotely, fined 5,000 roubles, left the country within 10 days and was barred from entering Russia for five years.
