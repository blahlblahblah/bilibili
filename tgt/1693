这本是一件好事，但近日，一家公司购买到的千余瓶酒精实为甲醇，并非乙醇。
That would be a good thing, but a company recently bought more than a thousand bottles of alcohol, not ethanol.
2月19日，同济大学附属东方医院药学部张誉艺表示，甲醇非但起不到消毒作用，还有一定的毒性。
On February 19, Zhang Yuyi, a pharmaceutical department attached to Tongji University, said methanol was not only ineffective in disinfection but also toxic.
张誉艺拿到了上述这家公司收到的“假酒精”。
Zhang Yue-yi got the "fake alcohol" received by the company.
它闻起来一点酒精的气味都没有，但是可以点燃。
It doesn't smell any alcohol, but it can be ignited.
送检进行了核磁检测，结果显示这是MeOH——纯甲醇，没有一点乙醇的成分，只有一点点水！这瓶假酒精的核磁谱图，显示实为甲醇。
The results showed that it was MeOH, pure methanol, with no ethanol in it and just a little water! This bottle of fake alcohol had a nuclear magnetic spectrum showing methanol.
甲醇和乙醇是两种完全不同的物质。
Methanol and ethanol are two completely different substances.
甲醇的分子式为CH3OH，是一种剧毒的化工原料。
The molecular formula of methanol is CH3OH, which is a highly toxic chemical material.
乙醇的分子式为CH3CH2OH，俗名酒精，比甲醇多了一个甲基。
The formula for ethanol is CH3CH2OH, commonly known as alcohol, which is one more methyl than methanol.
张誉艺说：“甲醇的用途广泛，是基础的有机化工原料和优质燃料。
"Methanol has a wide range of uses and is a basic organic chemical raw material and high-quality fuel," said Zhang.
但千万不能用甲醇代替酒精进行消毒。
But never disinfect with methanol instead of alcohol.
”张誉艺介绍，该公司买到的这瓶甲醇，浓度为95%。
Mr. Zhang says the company bought the bottle of methanol in a concentration of 95%.
如按照“75%乙醇”的使用方法，加入一定量水将其稀释后倒进喷壶里使用，就会经呼吸道和皮肤摄入体内产生毒性。
If the use of "75% ethanol", adding a certain amount of water diluted into the spray pot after use, will be through the respiratory and skin absorption of toxic.
短时大量吸入可能出现轻度眼、上呼吸道刺激症状，经一段时间潜伏期后可能出现头痛、头晕、乏力、眩晕、酒醉感、意识朦胧、谵妄，甚至昏迷。
Mild eye and upper respiratory tract irritation may occur in short periods of inhalation, and headaches, dizziness, fatigue, dizziness, drunkenness, confusion, delirium and even coma may occur after a incubation period.
视神经及视网膜病变，可有视物模糊、复视等，重者失明等。
The optic nerve and retinopathy, may have the visual object blur, the diplopia and so on, heavy person blindness.
“而一般用于消毒的酒精为浓度75%的乙醇。
"The alcohol commonly used for disinfection is ethanol at 75 percent concentration.
如果是浓度95%的乙醇，则可用于做有机溶剂、器械消毒等，还可以用来配制其他浓度的酒精。
If the concentration of 95% ethanol, it can be used to do organic solvents, equipment sterilization, and can be used to prepare other concentrations of alcohol.
”张誉艺补充说。
"Zhang added.
甲醇对人体有强烈毒性，应避免直接接触。
Methanol is highly toxic to humans and direct contact should be avoided.
否则会在人体新陈代谢中氧化成比甲醇毒性更强的甲醛和甲酸（蚁酸）。
Otherwise, formaldehyde and formic acid (formic acid), which are more toxic than methanol, are oxidized in human metabolism.
饮用含有甲醇的酒可引致失明、肝病、甚至死亡。
Drinking alcohol containing methanol can lead to blindness, liver disease and even death.
误饮4毫升以上就会出现中毒症状，超过10毫升即可因对视神经的永久破坏而导致失明，30毫升已能导致死亡。
Over 4ml can cause symptoms of intoxication, more than 10ml can lead to blindness due to permanent damage to the optic nerve, and 30ml can cause death.
初期中毒症状包括心跳加速、腹痛、上吐(呕)、下泻、无胃口、头痛、晕、全身无力。
Initial symptoms of poisoning include rapid heartbeat, abdominal pain, vomiting (nausea), diarrhea, loss of appetite, headache, dizziness and general weakness.
严重者会神智不清、呼吸急速至衰竭。
Severe cases can lead to confusion and rapid breathing to failure.
失明是它最典型的症状，甲醇进入血液后，会使组织酸性变强产生酸中毒，导致肾衰竭。
Blindness is one of its most typical symptoms. When methanol enters the bloodstream, it causes tissue acidity to become acidic, leading to kidney failure.
最严重者是死亡。
The worst is death.
甲醇具有的神经毒性，经消化道、呼吸道或皮肤摄入都会产生毒性反应，甲醇蒸气能损害人的呼吸道黏膜和视力。
Methanol has neurotoxic effects through the digestive tract, respiratory tract or skin, and methanol vapor can damage human respiratory mucosa and vision.
既然甲醇的危害这么大，购买时如何辨别呢？张誉艺说，最简单的鉴别方法就是闻气味。
Since methanol is so harmful, how to tell when you buy it? Zhang says the simplest way to tell is to smell.
“这家公司买到的就一点酒精味道也没有，肯定有猫腻。
"The company just bought it without any alcohol and it's sure to get greasy.
”另外，她提醒道，买的时候要留心是否有卫生许可证。
Also, she cautions, be careful when you buy a health permit.
“大家在购买消毒品时一定要擦亮眼睛，多加鉴别。
"When buying disinfectants, be sure to shine your eyes and identify them better.
如果出现任何不适请紧急就医。
If you feel unwell, seek medical attention immediately.
