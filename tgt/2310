参与物资捐赠工作的年轻志愿者，很多也是第一次卷入互联网的风波里。
Many of the young volunteers who took part in the donation work were also involved in the Internet for the first time.

At present, student volunteers at home and abroad are also taking action.
网络质疑、商家欺骗，打通物资渠道的工作在互联网暴露大量信息。
Cyber skepticism, merchant fraud, the work of opening up material channels in the Internet exposed a large amount of information.
这些参与物资捐赠工作的年轻志愿者，很多也是第一次卷入互联网的风波里。
Many of the young volunteers involved in the donation effort were among the first to become involved in the Internet.
一个人就是一座桥梁丁丁是德国海德堡大学的在读学生。
A man is a bridge Ding Ding is a student at the University of Heidelberg in Germany.
和很多朋友一样，她在疫情最开始时就投身物资捐赠志愿工作，希望为祖国做些事。
Like many of her friends, she began her epidemic by volunteering with material donations, hoping to do something for her country.
于是她参加了母校华南师范大学附属中学校友会，同时也为其他物资捐赠者传递资讯，而掌握多门外语也使她能够审核多国物资。
So she joined the alumni association of her alma mater South China Normal University and passed on information to other donors, and mastering multiple foreign languages also allowed her to vet supplies from other countries.
资讯传递就像把自己变成一座桥梁，丁丁说“我觉得自己成了人型资讯中转站”。
Information delivery is like turning myself into a bridge. Tintin says, "I feel like I'm a hub for human information."
1月31日丁丁了解到阿里巴巴公益开通了菜鸟免费向武汉运输救援物资的绿色通道，于是她很快和阿里巴巴联络人联系，通宵问清楚最新流程。
On January 31, Tintin learned that Alibaba had opened a green channel for free transport of relief materials to Wuhan, so she quickly contacted Alibaba contact to ask for the latest procedures.
两天后阿里巴巴的官方公告广泛传播开，丁丁便直接将自己整理好的详细流程发给需要的团队，节省更多时间。
Two days later, Alibaba's official announcement spread widely, and Tintin sent the detailed flow of his work directly to the team that needed it, saving more time.
阿里巴巴公益微博截图志愿工作中的困难并不少，比如前期网传的物资标准有含糊之处，无法完全确认国标所对应的欧标；物资、运输、通关、医院的通道分别掌握在不同人手里，打通整条渠道需要花很长时间；而且她发现一些团队由于缺乏管理经验，工作效率较低。
There are many difficulties in the volunteer work of Alibaba public welfare micro-blog, such as vague material standards in the early days, unable to fully confirm the national standard corresponding to the European standards; materials, transport, customs clearance, hospitals in the hands of different people, access to the whole channel takes a long time; and she found that some teams due to lack of management experience, less efficiency.
但当丁丁参与对接的第一批物资到中山医院时，她感觉一切都值得。
But when Tintin joined the docking of the first supplies to Zhongshan Hospital, she felt everything was worth it.
“那一刻我真想哭出来，实在太难了，为了几箱口罩，大家不知道辛苦忙碌了多少日子。
"At that moment I really want to cry out, really difficult, for a few boxes of masks, we do not know how many days of hard work.
”丁丁说。
'said Tintin.
丁丁参与对接的第一批物资到前线时（受访者供图）在和伙伴的共同努力下，如今她所在的华南师范大学附属中学校友会募集了60多万元捐款，将4万件隔离服、100个N95口罩、720个护目镜送到前线。
Ding Ding's first batch of supplies arrived at the front line. Working with her partners, the Alumni Association, an affiliate of South China Normal University, has raised more than $600,000 and sent 40,000 suits, 100 N95 masks and 720 goggles to the front line.
此外她还参与了十余个组织的对接，协助百余人。
In addition, she participated in the docking of more than a dozen organizations, assisting more than 100 people.
现在她成为校友会的欧洲联络员，继续跟进新一批的物资。
She now serves as the European liaison for the alumni association, continuing to follow up on new shipments.
二十岁的他们遭百万up主质疑然而，当年轻的志愿者迅速组建起队伍参与志愿工作时，网络上的质疑也悄然起伏。
They were questioned by millions of people in their twenties, but as young volunteers quickly formed teams to volunteer, the online skepticism crept up and down.
浙武抗毒联盟就经历了一次质疑风波。
Zhejiang Anti-Drug Alliance has experienced a controversy.
浙武抗毒联盟由浙江音乐学院和武汉音乐学院的二十多位学生发起，大多是95后和00后，分为统筹（财务）、物资对接、医院对接、物流对接、机动组、记录组等六个组。
Zhejiang University of Music and Wuhan Conservatory of Music launched by more than 20 students, mostly after 95 and 00, divided into co-ordination (financial), material docking, hospital docking, logistics docking, mobile group, records group and so on.
工作流程图（由受访者供图）截至目前共募捐到了178597元善款，购买了12000个口罩、10000个手套、4241件防护服、500个护目镜、400个防护面罩，帮助武汉中西结合医院、武汉协和医院、武汉中心医院等30家医院解决了燃眉之急。
Up to now, a total of 178,597 yuan has been raised in the form of flow charts, and 12,000 masks, 10,000 gloves, 4,241 protective suits, 500 goggles and 400 face masks have been purchased.
浙武抗毒联盟是丁丁最早对接的组织。
Zhejiang Anti-Drug Alliance was the earliest organization of Ding Ding.
“他们行动效率特别高，证据也保存得很好。
"They are extraordinarily efficient and the evidence is well-preserved.
”丁丁说。
'said Tintin.
负责医院对接和宣传工作的鲍小露说，2月1日，当大家正高兴地观看萧山市中医院发过来的感谢视频时，群里突然出现了一个视频链接《偷偷把假口罩捐给医院？这个’慈善组织’背后的真面目”》。
Bao Xiaolu, who is in charge of docking and publicity work for the hospital, said that on February 1, while watching a video of thanks from the Xiaoshan Chinese Hospital, a video link surreptitiously donating fake masks to hospitals appeared in the group.
她打开后才发现作者是一位名为“温柔JUNZ”的哔哩哔哩网站视频博主，质疑他们存在货源造假、护目镜价格虚高、账目信息未公开等问题，并直接指控浙武抗毒联盟“为了牟利，以次充好、以假充真”。
When she opened it, she discovered that the author was a video blogger at a serge-mile website called "Gentle JUNZ," questioning their origin, the inflated price of goggles and the lack of disclosure of accounting information, and directly accusing the Zhejiang Anti-Drug Alliance of "making profits by overcharging and pretending to be true."
该视频在被删除前，累计获得超过54万次播放量。
Before it was deleted, the video received a cumulative total of more than 540,000 broadcasts.
该视频博主发的第一个视频截图（现已删除）看着视频，鲍小露说：“第一感受就是气愤，做了这么多事居然还要背负莫须有的骂名，很多人在评论区指责、谩骂，这是第一次真心感受到网暴的可怕。
The first video clip (now deleted) from the video owner looked at the video and said: "The first feeling is anger, to do so many things have to bear a nameless name, many people in the comment area blame, abuse, this is the first time really feel the horror of cyber-violence.
”同时表示，该视频博主在发布前并未与任何一位成员取得联系。
He also said the video blogger had not contacted any of its members before the release.
于是她在个人微信公众平台发布文章《我们只是二十岁的我们，把能做的都做了，却……》，说明了她和伙伴们经历的这次质疑风波。
So she posted the article "We are only 20 years old, we do everything we can, but..." on the personal microphone public platform to explain her and her partners' experience of the controversy.
质疑视频出来后，浙武抗毒联盟成员立即与该视频博主联系进行协商，提供聊天记录、图片等证据，回应质疑。
After questioning the video came out, Zhejiang Anti-Drug Alliance members immediately contacted the video blog owner for consultations, provided chat records, pictures and other evidence to respond to the challenge.
经过协商后该视频博主同意删除视频并道歉，并于次日发布第二个视频《我为什么删除“浙武抗毒联盟”的视频？》。
After negotiations, the video blogger agreed to remove the video and apologize, and the next day released a second video, "Why did I delete the" Zhejiang Anti-Drug Alliance? "
2月1日“温柔JUNZ”文字动态截图鲍小露说：“我们欢迎大家质疑，也欢迎大家正当监督。
"We welcome all doubts and proper supervision," said Bao Xiaolu, February 1, the text of "Gentle JUNZ."
但质疑的人应先直接找当事人，如果当事人拿不出相关证据，可以在深入调查、确认证据的基础上以更合适的方式提出质疑。
However, the person making the challenge should first approach the party directly. If the party fails to produce relevant evidence, he or she may challenge the case in a more appropriate manner on the basis of an in-depth investigation and confirmation of evidence.
”“我觉得我们做的最好的地方在于请医院提供了接收意愿书，否则遇到这样的问题，我们的处境会更艰难。
"" I think the best we can do is ask the hospital for a letter of intent, otherwise we would be in a much more difficult situation.
”鲍小露说。
"said Bao.
经验不足的志愿者们学习到原来工作还有很多可以改进的地方：比如应该把统筹组和财务组分开，做好记录及时公布，另外还可以请第三方机构监督执行等。
The inexperienced volunteers learned that there was much more to be done in their jobs, such as separating the Coordination and Finance Sections, keeping records up to date, and asking third-party agencies to oversee implementation.
目前浙武抗毒联盟已经整理了物资捐赠信息并公开。
At present, Zhejiang Anti-Drug Alliance has sorted out the donation information and made it public.
部分接受意愿书（由受访者提供）捐赠物资信息（受访者提供）吃一堑、长一智的志愿者们如很多留学生志愿捐赠组织一样，武汉加油x北美留学生组也遇到了很多困难。
Part Acceptance Letter (Provided by Respondents) Donation Information (Supplied by Respondents) Volunteers who have grown up and become educated Like many volunteer organizations of foreign students, Wuhan refueling x North American students have encountered many difficulties.
兰萌说，组内一些小伙伴遭到个人信息的泄露、恶意诽谤，甚至还有人被对接者性骚扰等。
Some of the group's smaller partners had suffered leaks of personal information, malicious libel, and even sexual harassment by docked people, she said.
兰萌是武汉加油x北美留学生组综合公关部负责人。
Lan Meng is the head of the comprehensive public relations department of Wuhan refueling X North American students.
她介绍说，在1月23日即武汉封城第一日，看到各医院的求助信息，武汉加油x北美留学生组短短几小时内迅速组建团队，决定通过筹款、采购的方式，链接国内外民间医疗防护耗材物资，共同支援武汉及周边医院，并建立起交通部、信息与合作部、采购部、医院部等部门，财务与人事独立支持。
On the first day of January 23 in Wuhan, the first day of the city's closure, Wuhan refuelling x North American students quickly formed a team to support Wuhan and surrounding hospitals through fund-raising and purchasing, and set up the Ministry of Communications, Information and Cooperation, Purchasing Department and Hospital Department.
现在已发展到2000多名志愿者。
Now it has grown to more than 2000 volunteers.
有一天晚上，遇到一系列事情后大家情绪都很低落，但在紧急召开的电话会议上，兰萌和伙伴们听到总负责人这样说，“作为负责人你们不能崩，必须好好站着，为组员们遮风挡雨。
One night, after a series of incidents, everyone was in low spirits, but at an emergency conference call, Ms. Lansen and the partners heard the chief executive say, 'You mustn't collapse as directors.
”于是他们很快调整好了自身情绪，安抚组员们。
"They quickly adjusted their mood and reassured the group.
“我们都是平均年龄十八岁的学生，经过这次事件，每个人都好像一夜之间长大了。
"We are all students with an average age of eighteen, and after this incident everyone seems to have grown up overnight.
”综合资源部部长李文杰说。
"said Li Wenjie, director of integrated resources.
可是在最初组织捐赠时，兰萌和伙伴们也曾遭遇售卖“三无”口罩的无良商家，导致运达前线的五万只口罩不符合医用标准。
But when she first organized the donation, Lan Meng and her partners also encountered unscrupulous traders selling "three-nil" masks, resulting in 50,000 masks arriving on the front line that did not meet medical standards.
兰萌表示，“五万口罩事件”还在继续调查中，目前取得了一定的进展。
Lan Meng said the "50,000 mask incident" was still under investigation and some progress had been made.
在2月3日时已在执法机关协助下将27.5万善款全部追回，同时厂家补发了5万只合格的口罩到武汉，之后炒货者也落入法网。
By 3 February, 275,000 donations had been recovered with the assistance of law enforcement agencies, and 50,000 qualified masks had been reissued to Wuhan by the manufacturers.
武汉加油x北美留学生组通告微博截图“今天协查“五万口罩事件”的警官告诉我们，当初的那位炒货贩子觉得就是在对付一帮小年轻，好糊弄得很，没想到我们会这么倔，硬要追责到底。
Wuhan refueling x North American students notice Weibo screenshot "Today we helped look up the" 50000 Mask Incident "police officers told us that the original speculation is a group of young people, very muddled, I did not expect that we would be so stubborn, to insist on the end.
其实不是我们倔强，是要对捐助者、志愿者和自己负责呀。
It is not that we are stubborn, but that we are accountable to donors, volunteers and ourselves.
”兰萌在朋友圈中写到。
'she wrote in her circle of friends.
兰萌朋友圈截图（受访者提供）舆论朝向如天气，网友们看到年轻志愿者的工作成果时喊“少年强则中国强”，当四面八方的争议出来，有人就质疑这群年轻人“不靠谱”。
Public opinion is heading in the direction of the weather, with netizens calling the results of work done by young volunteers' young men stronger than China '. When controversies erupted in all directions, some questioned the' unreliable nature 'of these young people.
正当质疑是为更好地监督，但无良商家的欺骗和不明真相网民的攻击，都没有让志愿者们怀疑自己努力付出的意义。
Legitimate skepticism is about better oversight, but unscrupulous businessmen and uninformed netizens have not made volunteers question the meaning of their efforts.
而来之不易的捐赠成果是志愿者们最大的安慰，武汉加油x北美留学生组目前募集到931193.41元人民币，已运送N95口罩50600个、医用外科口罩14000个、医用手套35400双、消毒液120箱、护目镜200个等，N95口罩34000个也即将到达武汉。
The hard-won donation is the greatest comfort to the volunteers, Wuhan refueling x North American students group has collected 931193.41 yuan, delivered N95 mask 50600, medical surgical masks 14,000, medical gloves 35400, disinfectant 120 boxes, goggles 200, etc., N95 mask 34,000 will soon arrive in Wuhan.
与司机志愿者联系截图（受访者提供）即便遭遇质疑、经历高强度的工作，志愿者们感到温暖的事情还有很多。
Connect with the volunteer drivers. (Respondents provided) Even in the face of skepticism and high intensity of work, volunteers felt warm about many things.
一次武汉加油x北美留学生组志愿者们需要把1000件隔离衣从仙桃运到荆州，当时很多志愿司机由于多日奔波身体吃不消，还有人出现了疑似感染的症状，甚至确诊，志愿者们陷入了找不到司机的困境。
At a time when volunteers in Wuhan refuelled x North American students needed to transport 1,000 pieces of paraphernalia from peaches to Jingzhou, many volunteer drivers struggled with days of travel, others developed symptoms of suspected infection or even were diagnosed, and volunteers were left stranded without drivers.
当他们打算放弃时，一位90后女孩承担起了司机的工作，她拒绝用紧缺的隔离衣，披着一次性桌布驶向了130公里外的荆州。
When they decided to give up, a 90-year-old girl took up the job as a driver, refusing to use her scarce quarantine clothes and wearing a disposable tablecloth as she headed for Jingzhou, 130 kilometers away.
