澎湃新闻记者 刘栋韩国总统文在寅3日表示，随着大邱和附近的庆尚北道新冠疫情持续蔓延，韩国宣布对病毒“作战”，政府所有机构进入24小时全面戒备状态。
South Korean President Wen Jiabao said Wednesday that as Daegu and nearby Gyeongshan North Province continue to spread of the new crown epidemic, South Korea announced a "war" against the virus, all government agencies into a 24-hour state of full alert.
据韩国疾控部门的最新通报，截至3月3日上午9时，全国再新增600例确诊病例，累计4812例。
As of 9: 00 a.m. on March 3, 600 new cases had been confirmed nationwide, bringing the total to 4,812, the CDC said.
据《韩国时报》报道，大邱政府和卫生官员2日表示，由于感染者人数不断增加，已长期超负荷工作的当地医生、护士和其他医疗专业人员疲惫不堪，已有一些护士集体辞职，造成了大邱及其邻近庆尚北道的护士短缺的局面。
Taegu government and health officials said Thursday that the growing number of infected people left local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals exhausted by the long-term overload. Some nurses have resigned, creating a shortage of nurses in Daegu and the neighbouring province of Gyeongshan.
报道称，韩国疾病控制和预防中心指定专门接收新冠病人的医院——庆尚北道的浦项医疗中心的100名护士中已有16名于上周离职。
Sixteen of the 100 nurses at the Pudong Medical Center in the northern province of Gyeongshan, a hospital designated by the South Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to receive new patients, left last week.
这16名护士离职原因包括工作过度劳累、需要照顾孩子等个人原因。
The 16 nurses left for personal reasons including overwork and the need to take care of their children.
根据规定，在指定医院内负责照顾新冠病人的医护人员必须留在医院内直至疫情结束才可返回家中。
It is a requirement that health care workers in designated hospitals who take care of new crown patients remain in the hospital until the end of the outbreak before returning home.
不过韩国卫生官员称，这些护士并非因为新冠肺炎疫情辞职，事实上她们早在数周前就递交了辞职报告。
But South Korean health officials say the nurses did not resign over the outbreak of pneumonia, in fact they did so weeks ago.
随着庆北地区新冠肺炎疫情严重，她们一直坚守，直至有新护士入职才离开。
With a severe outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia in Gyeongbei, they held out until new nurses arrived.
在医务人员短缺的情况下，庆北政府和浦项市政府请求韩国护士协会支持，后者派出了15名护士援助。
In the face of a shortage of medical staff, the Gyeongbei government and the Pudong municipality requested the support of the Korean Nurses Association, which sent 15 nurses to assist.
浦项市政府还承诺向该医疗中心派遣16名医务人员、24名行政支持工作人员和10名志愿者，但随着疫情不断升级，对医务人员短缺的担忧仍然比比皆是。
The city government has also pledged to send 16 medical staff, 24 administrative support staff and 10 volunteers to the medical centre, but fears of shortages abound as the epidemic escalates.
位于大邱重灾区的启明大学东山医学中心表示，该医院需要更多的医疗人员。
The Dongshan Medical Center at Qiming University, a disaster area in Daegu, said the hospital needed more medical staff.
上周，一名传染病的医生由于过度疲劳而昏倒。
Last week, a doctor with an infectious disease fainted from fatigue.
然而根据医院的说法，这位医生在恢复知觉后继续照顾病人。
However, according to the hospital, the doctor continued to take care of the patient after he regained consciousness.
然而包括上述医疗中心在内的其他医院越来越多的医务人员表示，他们打算辞职，因为他们已经到了“极限”。
However, a growing number of medical staff in other hospitals, including the above-mentioned medical centre, say they intend to resign because they have reached the "limit."
一位不愿透露姓名的医院管理人员表示: “如果情况继续这样下去，其它医院的护士可能很快就会像浦项医疗中心的护士一样集体辞职。
"If things continue like this, nurses from other hospitals could soon resign as a group," said a hospital official, who declined to be named.
”3日晚些时候，为了鼓励和支持医务人员，庆尚北道政府表示，在疫情结束之前，将向医务人员支付额外的工资。
"Later Wednesday, to encourage and support medical staff, the Gyeongshan provincial government said it would pay extra salaries to medical staff until the outbreak is over.
医生每天将额外获得55万韩元(3218人民币) ，而护士每天将额外获得30万韩元（1755人民币）。
Doctors will get an extra 550,000 won (3,218 yuan) a day, while nurses will get an extra 300,000 won (1,755 yuan) a day.
“我们将尽最大努力阻止病毒的传播，并尽早治疗确诊病人。
"We will do our utmost to stop the spread of the virus and to treat confirmed patients as early as possible.
”庆尚北道行政长官李喆雨说。
Mr. Li, Chief Executive of Gyeongshan North Province, said.
目前，在大邱和庆尚北道有4258例确诊患者。
Currently, there are 4,258 confirmed cases in Daegu and Gyeongshan North Province.
超过2000名患者在家中隔离等候医院的床位。
More than 2,000 patients were kept in isolation at home awaiting hospital beds.
而当地官员表示，未来几天确诊的患者数量可能会继续增加。
Local officials said the number of confirmed cases was likely to continue to rise in the coming days.
