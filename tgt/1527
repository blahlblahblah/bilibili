澎湃新闻记者 薛莎莎56岁的杨柳萍骑着电动车在前，同事毛蕊开着车在后面跟着。
Xue Sasha, a 56-year-old journalist, rode ahead on an electric car, followed by her colleague, Pistil.
途中，杨柳萍多次“赶”毛蕊回家，让他不要跟着，“我不能坐你的车，我已经病倒了，你不能再倒下”。
On the way, Yang Liping "catch" several times to return home, let him not follow, "I can not take your car, I have fallen sick, you can not fall down."
毛蕊放心不下，一直跟着，直到目送杨柳萍进医院。
Stamens restless, followed, until he saw Yang Liuping into the hospital.
这一幕，发生在今年正月初三（1月27日），持续低烧、乏力五天的湖北武汉市普仁医院复新分院（洪山区东方雅园社区医院）副院长杨柳萍，在疑似感染新冠肺炎的情况下，被院长毛蕊一路“监督”送到普仁医院检查。
The scene, which occurred on January 27, continued low fever, five days of fatigue, Wuhan City, Hubei Province Puren Hospital (Hongshan Oriental Garden Community Hospital) Vice-President of the Hong Shan Oriental Park Community Hospital, Yang Liping, was "supervised" by Dean Mao Lian all the way to Puren Hospital for examination in the case of suspected new crown pneumonia.
杨柳萍做CT检查发现，她双肺已感染，医生说她疑似感染新冠肺炎，但医生没说出口的话是“已经比较严重了”。
A CT scan of Liping Yang found that her lungs were infected and doctors said she was suspected of contracting pneumonia, but doctors did not say the words were "more serious."
住院前两天，杨柳萍高烧不退，病情日渐严重，她做了最坏打算并写下“遗言”。
Two days before she was hospitalized, she suffered from a high fever and became seriously ill. She prepared for the worst and wrote down her last words.
经过医护人员的治疗，两天后退烧，她身体持续好转，2月10日康复出院。
After medical treatment, two days later fever, she continued to improve, February 10 convalescent discharged.
“我干了一辈子护士，这次体验了一把病人的感受。
"I've been a nurse all my life, and this time I've had a patient experience.
医护人员真的很不容易，医患之间要相互理解、相互包容。
Medical staff is really not easy, doctors and patients to understand each other, mutual tolerance.
”杨柳萍2月16日对澎湃新闻（www.thepaper.cn）感慨说道。
"Yang Liuping said Feb. 16 with emotion at the roaring news (www.thepper.cn).
面对疫情，杨柳萍所在的社区医院有人自愿报名去了一线，有人选择坚守，担起守护社区居民的健康之责。
In the face of the epidemic, Yangliuping's community hospital someone volunteered to go to the front line, some people choose to stick to, shoulder the responsibility of guarding the health of community residents.
如今隔离在家的杨柳萍最放心不下，是那些还坚守岗位的同事们，“可不要再有人感染了，到我为止，其他人都要好好的。
Now isolation at home Yang Liping the most worried, is those who still hold the post colleagues, "do not infect others, until I, others will be good.

本文图片均由受访者供图【杨柳萍口述】“同事坚持送我去医院，我赶不走他”我叫杨柳萍，还差四个月，我就满56岁了。
My name is Yang Liping. I am still four months away, and I will be 56 years old. My name is Yang Liping.
我在武汉市普仁医院做护士30多年，去年退休后我被医院返聘，在普仁医院复新分院任副院长一职，和院长毛蕊一起带领医院年轻的医生护士们，为社区居民看诊治病。
After retiring as a nurse in Puren Hospital in Wuhan for more than 30 years, I was rehired by the hospital last year to resume my position as Vice-President of the new hospital in Puren Hospital.
大概在除夕的前两三天，我开始嗓子疼，随后开始发低烧，浑身不舒服。
About two or three days before New Year's Eve, I began to have a sore throat, followed by a low fever and discomfort.
在此之前，医院接待了很多发热、感冒病人，医护人员都忙个不停。
Prior to this, the hospital received a lot of fever, cold patients, medical staff are busy.
我也一直在医院导医台、注射室和办公室忙来忙去，接触了很多病人。
I have also been busy at the hospital's guide desk, injection room and office, reaching out to many patients.
那时，我们虽然听说了新冠肺炎的事，但警惕性都不高，而且社区医院没什么防护设备，只能戴口罩工作。
At that time, although we heard about the new crown pneumonia, but vigilance is not high, and community hospitals do not have protective equipment, can only wear masks work.
正月初一（1月25日），我值完班回家，以为休息几天身体就能好转。
On the first day of the first month (January 25), I went home from work, thinking that a few days of rest will improve my health.
没想到我反复发烧，全身酸软、无力，还咳嗽、气喘，越来越难受。
Unexpectedly I repeatedly feverish, the whole body is weak, still coughing, asthma, more and more afflictive.
毛院长很担心我，一直叮嘱我尽快检查。
Dean Mao was worried about me and kept asking me to examine him as soon as possible.
发烧五天后，我开始怀疑自己感染了新冠肺炎。
After five days of fever, I began to suspect that I was infected with pneumonia.
正月初三（1月27日）毛院长要开车带我去普仁医院检查。
On the third day of the first month (27 January), Chairman Mao will drive me to Puren Hospital for examination.
我说“不能传染给你”，坚决不愿意坐他的车，我骑上电动车就走了，他就一直开车跟在后面。
I said "can not infect you", resolutely unwilling to take his car, I rode on the electric car and left, he has been driving behind.
我“赶”他回家，我说“我已经病倒了，医院还需要有人撑着，你不能再病倒了”。
I "rushed" him home and I said, "I'm sick, the hospital needs someone to support it. You can't fall ill anymore."
可怎么“赶”他都不走，就这样，他开车跟了一路，直到目送我进医院。
But how to "catch" him not to leave, so he drove all the way, until he saw me into the hospital.
我知道，毛院长不放心我一个人，但我不能让他承担被感染的风险。
I know that Dean Mao is not comfortable with me alone, but I cannot allow him to bear the risk of infection.
医生没有说出下半句“已经比较严重了”我做了CT，医生看片子说双肺已经感染，疑似感染了新冠肺炎，让我住院治疗。
The doctor did not say the next part of the sentence "is already more serious" I did a CT, the doctor said that both lungs have been infected, suspected to be infected with pneumonia, let me hospitalized.
我后来才知道，当时医生只告诉我疑似感染，但是没有说出下半句话“已经比较严重了”。
I later learned that the doctor told me only about the suspected infection, but did not say the next sentence, "already serious."
大家都是同事，他们担心我承受不住，所以瞒着我。
Everyone was a colleague and they were afraid I couldn't bear it, so they kept it from me.
我这个人心态比较好，既然已经这样了，那就只能接受事实了。
I am in a better state of mind. Now that I have done so, I can only accept the facts.
就这样，我住进了普仁医院开辟的感染病区的隔离病房里。
In this way, I was admitted to the isolation ward in the infected area of Puren Hospital.
头两天，我高烧不退，一度烧至38.5摄氏度，病情严重，没有食欲，浑身难受。
The first two days, I have a high fever, once burning to 38.5 degrees Celsius, serious illness, no appetite, all over afflictive.
当时我在病房里一直睡不着，也做了最坏的打算，写了点东西，准备交代家人。
I had been unable to sleep in my room, and had prepared myself for the worst, writing something for my family.
医生见我状态不对，给我加了能退烧的药。
When the doctor saw that I was in a bad condition, he gave me medicine to relieve my fever.
没想到，这烧还真退下去了。
I didn't expect the fire to die down.
这是一个明显的转折点，自退烧起，我的状态日益好转，精神也好很多了。
This is a clear turning point, since the fever, I have been in better shape, much better spirit.
医生每天定时来查房，询问我的病情，适当调整治疗方案。
The doctor visits the room regularly every day, asks me the condition, adjusts the treatment plan suitably.
护士们例行给我输液、检查。
Nurses routinely give me infusions and tests.
病区医护人员在照顾病人。
Medical staff in the sick area are taking care of patients.
医院的伙食很不错，后勤想着法子给我们增加营养，每天定时询问我们想吃什么。
The food in the hospital was good. Logistics tried to give us more nourishment, and we were asked regularly every day what we wanted to eat.
同事们都很关心我，送来水果、牛奶。
My colleagues are very concerned about me, brought fruit, milk.
我想，我得好好吃饭吃菜、吃水果，他们辛辛苦苦帮我们准备这些，我不能辜负了他们，有时我食欲不好，也会坚持吃完。
I think, I have to eat a good meal, eat fruit, they have worked hard to help us prepare these, I can not live up to them, sometimes I have a bad appetite, will stick to eat.
病情逐渐好转，我心态又变得乐观积极了。
The condition gradually improves, my mood becomes optimistic and positive again.
我本就是个开朗的人，家里大小事都是我操心，抗压能力比一般人都强些。
I am a cheerful person, I am worried about the small things in my family, the ability to withstand pressure than the average person is better.
从我身体不舒服到住院治疗，只有我爱人、女儿和几个同事知道，我没告诉其他亲戚朋友。
From my indisposition to my hospitalization, only my wife, daughter and a few colleagues knew that I had not told other relatives and friends.
告诉他们也是平添担心，不能解决问题，何必呢？出院时，我倒是公开了“病情”。
Tell them they are worried, can not solve the problem, why? When I left the hospital, I was open about the "illness."
有护士抱怨我说“怎么那么低调，现在才告诉我们”，我打趣说“现在才来关心我，晚了吧。
One of the nurses complained that I was "so low-key now," and I joked, "It's too late to care about me.
”心疼医护人员身体好转后，医生每次查房问我怎么样，我都信心满满地说“很好！”退烧后，我就相信我一定会好起来。
"Care for the health care workers after the improvement, the doctor every time the room asked me how, I am full of confidence that" very good!
我没有基础疾病，平时也注重锻炼，体质很好，一直都没住过院，所以我相信自己。
I have no basic illness, usually also pay attention to exercise, physique is very good, has not lived in the hospital, so I believe in myself.
我记得有一次，医生让我去三楼做检查，我一口气爬楼梯上去的，身体没问题。
I remember the time the doctor asked me to go to the third floor for an examination. I climbed the stairs without a problem.
我住进病房没几天，隔壁床位住进了一位年近70的老太太，她也是退休后医院返聘到社区医院工作的职工。
A few days after I was admitted to the ward, a nearly 70-year-old woman was admitted to the bed next door. She was also recruited to work in the community hospital after her retirement.
刚开始她身体状况也很不好，家中儿子、女儿都感染了，情况很糟糕，但我们在病房里互相照应着，有时也彼此鼓励。
At first she was in poor health, her son and daughter were infected, and things were terrible, but we looked after each other in the ward and sometimes encouraged each other.
2月7日之后，我分别做了两次核酸检测，结果都是阴性，CT片子显示我肺部的炎症都被吸收了。
After February 7, I had two separate tests for nucleic acids, both negative, and CT scans showed that inflammation in my lungs had been absorbed.
我想着床位那么紧张，就赶紧出院吧。
I think the bed is so tight, let's get out of the hospital quickly.
别看隔壁病床的老太太年纪大了，她身体好转得也挺快。
Although the old woman in the next bed is old, she is getting better very quickly.
1月10日，我俩都出院了。
We were both discharged from the hospital on January 10th.
出院时，我给护士长写了一段感谢的话，和她拍了张照片留念。
As I left the hospital, I wrote a thank-you note to the head nurse and took a photo with her.
我做了一辈子护士，我最知道医护人员的辛苦。
I've been a nurse all my life, and I know the drudgery of medical staff best.
疫情面前，坚守一线、给我们治疗的很多护士都是20岁出头的“小丫头”，刚毕业没多久。
In the face of the epidemic, many of the nurses who stood by and treated us were "little girls" in their early 20s, not long after graduation.
他们虽然年轻，但是很勇敢，能担起责任。
Young as they are, they are brave enough to shoulder their responsibilities.
看着她们辛苦工作，我非常心疼。
It pains me to watch them work so hard.
有一次，一个小护士给我扎针，她穿着厚厚的防护服，带着面罩、手套等，护目镜上起雾看不清，摸血管和正常状态不一样，操作起来很不方便。
On one occasion, a small nurse gave me a needle, she was wearing a thick protective clothing, wearing masks, gloves, etc., goggles fog can not see, touch blood vessels and normal state is not the same, very inconvenient to operate.
我怕小护士给我扎针有压力，就跟她说“我的血管不好找，你只管扎，我不要紧，你放心，不用怕”。
I am afraid the nurse to give me a needle pressure, just say to her: "My blood vessels are not good to find, you just Zha, I do not matter, you rest assured, do not be afraid."
有时，药水输完了，我就自己换，我想减少他们的工作量，我能完成的，一定不按铃叫护士。
Sometimes, when the potion is gone, I change it myself. I want to reduce their workload. I can do it without ringing the bell for a nurse.
这些年轻的医生护士坚守一线，还那么辛苦，已经非常不错了，他们需要鼓励。
These young doctors and nurses are working so hard and hard that they need encouragement.
所以我就想呼吁，医患之间一定要相互理解、相互包容。
So I would like to call for mutual understanding and tolerance between doctors and patients.
最近，病人太多，医护人员有照顾不到位的地方，还希望患者朋友们能多理解他们。
Recently, too many patients, medical personnel have not been in the place of care, but also hope that patients friends can understand them more.
“等你凯旋归来，给你烤五花肉吃”出院后，我隔离在家，每天坚持在房间里锻炼，有时去菜园里种果种菜。
When I left the hospital, I stayed at home in isolation, exercising every day, sometimes planting fruit and vegetables in my garden.
我唯独放心不下的是我那些还坚守岗位的同事。
The only ones I'm worried about are my co-workers who are still on the job.
疫情来了，我们社区医院的医护人员，有人自愿报名去了一线，有人留守社区，担起守护社区居民的健康之责。
The outbreak came, our community hospital medical personnel, some volunteers to go to the frontline, some people left behind the community, shoulder the responsibility of guarding the health of the community residents.
普仁医院号召医护人员支援金银潭医院时，有一名95后小护士第一个报名。
When Pu Yan Hospital called on medical staff to support the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital, a 95-year-old nurse was the first to register.
我担心她说：“你妈妈同意才允许你上一线”。
I was worried when she said, "Your mother will allow you to take the first step."
她说：“妈妈非常支持”。
"Mom is very supportive," she said.
杨柳萍派去支援金银潭医院的“95后”小护士。
She was sent to support the "95 post" nurse at the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital.
除夕夜前一天，她接到支援一线的通知后立即动身，连东西都没收拾，更没在家吃年夜饭。
On the eve of New Year's Eve, she left immediately after receiving a line of support. She did not pack up, and did not eat at home.
我真的心疼她，也很愧疚。
I really love her, but also very sorry.
但疫情当前，没办法，只能派去支援。
But the current epidemic, there is no choice but to send support.
此后，我每天都微信联系她，问她的工作状态和身体情况。
Since then, I have written to her every day, asking her about her work status and health.
我感染了新冠肺炎的事，也不敢跟她说，怕她担心。
I was infected with Newcastle pneumonia, and dared not tell her lest she should worry.
这孩子自己在那么危险的一线，还经常发信息关心我。
The child himself was on such a dangerous line that he often sent messages of concern to me.
我常鼓励她说“等你凯旋归来，来我家烧烤，我给你烤五花肉吃，我烤的都说好吃”。
I often encourage her to say, "When you return home, come to my home barbecue, I bake you mulled meat, I roast all say delicious."
这些年轻的医生护士既是我的同事，也像我自家女儿一样。
These young doctors and nurses are as much my colleagues as my own daughters.
我住进医院的这段时间，社区医院的同事还坚守在岗位上。
During my stay in the hospital, my colleagues at the community hospital stayed on the job.
我隔离在家，每天都惦记着他们。
I was alone, thinking of them every day.
他们都不被感染，这是我现在最大的心愿。
They're not infected. That's my big wish right now.
我一再跟他们强调，“到我这里为止，不想听到你们哪个人感染的消息”。
I repeatedly stressed to them, "Until I get here, I don't want to hear from any of you."
现在我让他们每天自查体温并上报，一旦有异常，早发现早治疗。
Now I ask them to check their body temperature every day and report that they will be treated early if anything goes wrong.
抗击疫情期间，居民身体有不舒服，又不方便出门，没办法来社区医院就诊。
During the fight against the epidemic, residents have physical discomfort, and it is not convenient to go out, can not come to the community hospital.
这是前段时间我和同事很担心的问题。
This is something my colleagues and I were worried about some time ago.
于是，我们不断壮大原来建的“健康咨询群”，在微信群里把社区内的居民都汇集起来。
As a result, we continued to build up the original "health advisory group," in the micro-letter group to bring together the residents of the community.
他们有问题就在群里提问，我们医护人员解答。
If they have questions, ask them in the group. We, the paramedics, answer them.
杨柳萍和支援一线小护士交流病人情况。
Liping Yang and the front-line nurses exchanged information about the patient.
正值抗疫的特殊时期，哪怕我们给出一个小小的建议，也能解决居民很多健康担忧，消除他们的恐慌，让他们心里踏实些。
Even a small piece of advice at a particular time in the fight against the epidemic could address many of the residents' health concerns, assuage their fears and reassure them.
