腊月二十九，我觉得再这样下去不行，得跟村长商量一下。
On the 29th of December, I thought it would be impossible to go on like this. I had to talk to the village chief.
“村长，武汉肺炎都搞得‘封城’了，我们还有好多人聚众，要不要宣传……”话还没说完，听见电话那头，麻将粒儿磕得脆脆响。
"Village chief, Wuhan Pneumonia has been 'closed', we still have a lot of people gathered, do you want to publicize..." Before the end of the words, heard the phone, Mahjong particles crisp and crisp.
陈家冲，一个平日里冷清得近乎空巢的农村，在今年春节前一条又一条的流感疫情通报中，一如往常地迎来了一年当中最为热闹的日子，一样地搞相亲、办酒席、催账款、打麻将。
Chen Jia-chong, a normally deserted countryside near-empty nests, has, as usual, celebrated one of the busiest days of the year with appointments, banquets, accounts and mahjong in the annual Lunar New Year bulletin.
而陈家冲所在的蕲春县，是一个距离武汉2小时车程的全国贫困县。
However, the Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon in the Agkistrodon county is a poverty-stricken county two hours away from Wuhan.
即使所有人都“清楚得很”，自己的隔壁左右、叔伯亲戚，几乎每家每户都有从武汉回来、路过的人，或者大家都与武汉归人有过亲密接触。
Even if everyone is "very clear," their next door, uncle and auntie relatives, almost every family from Wuhan back, passing by, or we have all had close contact with Wuhan returnees.
但这些，并不能限制乡亲们加入到一场人口的交叉大流动中来。
But these do not limit the villagers to participate in a large cross-flow of population.
湖北麻城，“封城”进行中的麻城火车站（图/财经杂志）大部分人照旧出去玩，吃喜酒、打麻将、走亲戚，“没这么严重吧”“我命贱”“农村空气好”，是最常听到的话。
Most people go out for fun as usual, eating wedding wine, playing Mahjong and visiting relatives. "It's not that bad." "I'm cheap" "Rural air is good," is the most frequently heard word.
直到1月23日24时，黄冈市“封城”。
Until 2400 hours on January 23, the city of Huanggang was "closed."
同时，蕲春县“封城”。
At the same time, Agkistrodon acutus Agkistrodon County is "closed."
大年初一一早，蕲春县各乡镇的离境道路，陆续封锁。
On the first day of the New Year, the Agkistrodon acutus villages and towns have been blocked.
中午，各个村口的一条条路上，也堆起了高土堆，砌起了砖头、堆着大捆的树桩、停着打横的卡车。
At noon high mounds of earth, brick, stacks of stacks, and lorries were stopped at the entrance of the villages.
五花八门的“拦路”照片，在微信群里流传。
A wide variety of "blocking" photos, in the micro-letter group circulation.
以陈家冲为例，光是从村口到镇上，一条5公里的路，就有5道关卡。
Take Chen Jia Chong, for example, from the entrance of the village to the town, a five-kilometer road, there are five roadblocks.
鄂东南地区，大年初一路况简图热闹，急转直下。
In the southeast of Hubei, the New Year's Day road is busy.
大家终于意识到了，情况严峻，得管起自己来了，尤其是一些大学生崭露头角，在卫生意识落后的乡村中，开始发挥“管家”的作用。
It was finally recognized that the situation was serious and that it was time for them to take charge, especially as some university students cut a figure and began to act as housekeepers in the backward villages.
新年伊始，家家关门闭户，七八十岁的老人都说，“生平头一遭”。
At the beginning of the new year, every house was closed. Seventy or eighty-year-olds said, "First time in my life."
而此时，一些关于病情的谣言也开始传了起来。
Meanwhile, rumors began to circulate about the disease.
“蕲春县一乡镇医院全院医务人员感染新型肺炎”，这样的谣言一传十，十传百，又很快被灭下。
"The Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Township Hospital is infected with a new type of pneumonia." The rumors spread from one township hospital to another.
紧张感敲打着人们的心脏。
Tensions beat on people's hearts.
乡镇疫情地图周晓平人生第一次那么频繁地接电话。
Township Epidemic Map Zhou Xiaoping answered the phone so frequently for the first time.
手机响个不停，来电者不是记者，就是想要捐助物资的人。
Cellphones keep ringing, and callers are either journalists or people who want to donate material.
他是刘河镇卫生院的负责人。
He is the head of Liu He Town Health Center.
我给周晓平打过两次电话。
I called Zhou Xiaoping twice.
他告诉我，“全院医务人员感染”是谣言，腊月二十九，他们卫生院收治了第1位高疑似病人，到正月初二下午，全院隔离、留院观察的疑似感染者是20人左右，有4名医务人员感染。
He told me that "the hospital medical staff infection" is rumor, Lai Yun 29, their hospital admitted the first high suspect patient, by the afternoon of the first month, the hospital quarantine, stay in the hospital observation of the suspected infected 20 people, four medical staff infected.
大年初二这一天，刘河镇卫生院遇到了一点小麻烦。
On the second day of the New Year, Liu Hezhen Health Institute encountered a little trouble.
给他们卫生院做饭的饭店老板，疑似感染新型肺炎，居家隔离了。
The hotel owner who cooked for their hospital was suspected of contracting a new form of pneumonia and was isolated at home.
卫生院值班的医务人员，加上病患一共100多人，中午都没有饭吃。
The medical staff on duty at the clinic, together with more than 100 patients, were left without food at noon.
1月26日，春节期间，医护人员依旧坚守岗位，忙碌在防控疫情一线（图/新华社）刘河镇卫生院门口原本有一排小饭店，但愿意过年营业的只有这一家，卫生院之前给了夫妻俩一些普通的外科口罩，并承诺给他们随时检查。
(Photo / Xinhua) There used to be a row of small hotels in front of the Liu He Town Health Center, but this was the only one willing to open for the Lunar New Year. The clinic had given the couple some common surgical masks and promised to check them all the time.
49岁的老板娘不明白，说自己老公一直都戴着口罩的，怎么还是感染了。
49-year-old woman do not understand that her husband has been wearing a mask, how still infected.
现在只剩她一个人做不来饭，但中午还是炖了一锅鲫鱼汤，送到卫生院的病房门口去。
Now she alone can not cook, but at noon or stew a pot of crucian carp soup, sent to the hospital ward door.
老板娘没有埋怨卫生院。
The landlady did not complain.
她后来在微信上问我：“您能帮他们搞到防护服吗？医院这些小孩子，医生护士，不知道有多辛苦哦。
She wrote to me later: "Can you help them get protective clothing? Hospital these children, doctor nurses, do not know how hard it is.
”这一天的中饭，后来是向镇政府食堂请求援助，他们才吃上的。
They ate lunch that day and then asked for help in the town hall.
但具体能吃多久，周晓平也不清楚。
But exactly how long he can eat, Zhou Xiaoping is also unclear.
我问他这几天吃的什么，他告诉我，除夕那天他们卫生院领导班子6个人，是一起在办公室吃的泡面。
I asked him what he had been eating these days, and he told me that on New Year's Eve there were six people in the leadership of their hospital, eating noodles together in the office.
“大年初一早饭忙忘了，想起来就中午了。
"I forgot about breakfast at the beginning of New Year and remembered it at noon.
”1月24日，华中科技大学附属同济医院的年夜饭，也是方便面蛋黄派等整个蕲春县，15个乡镇，疫情各有不同，除了县城医院之外，最为紧张的，可能就是刘河镇卫生院和张榜镇卫生院。
On January 24, the Chinese New Year dinner at Tongji Hospital attached to Huazhong University of Science and Technology and the Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon in 15 townships.
这两家卫生院的辖区最大，医务人员数量分别在180人和260人左右，疑似感染病人也最多。
The two hospitals have the largest jurisdictions, with around 180 and 260 medical personnel respectively, with the largest number of suspected infected patients.
一个朋友想要联系医疗物资，捐助给张榜镇卫生院，可打了几个之后，负责人张旭明生气了。
A friend wanted to contact medical supplies, donated to Zhang Bang Town Health Center, but after a few dozen, the responsible Zhang Xu Ming was angry.
“你不要再问我缺什么了，你现在给我什么我都要！你们这样的电话，我一天接一百个，可几天了毛都没看到，现在接你们的电话我很反感，但是我还是没法，我得接，我什么都要。
I want everything you give me! I've got a hundred calls a day that I haven't seen for days, and I hate to answer your calls now, but I still can't. I have to take it, I want anything.
”朋友之所以找到张榜镇卫生院，是听说了大年初一，他们卫生院有一个放射科的医生，穿着一次性雨衣，戴着摩托车头盔给病人做检查。
"Friends found the Zhangpong Town Health Center, is heard of the New Year's Day, their hospital has a radiology doctor, wearing a disposable raincoat and motorcycle helmet to examine patients.
朋友听到之后流泪了，说：“一线乡镇医生好难。
Hearing this, the friend burst into tears and said, "First-line township doctors are very difficult.
”张旭明跟朋友辟谣，说没有这件事，“这是农村人做的事，医院不会。
"Zhang Xu Ming told his friends that there was no such thing as a rumor," This is a rural thing, not a hospital.
”可有医务人员告诉我，是真的，他看到过那张照片。
But the paramedics told me it was true, and he had seen the picture.
刚好那天下雨，医生在手术衣外面套的雨衣，戴的头盔，“张榜医院确实缺防护服”。
Just that day it rained, the doctor in the surgical jacket outside the raincoat, wearing helmets, "Zhang Bang Hospital really lack protective clothing."
湖北孝感，网友“格桑小巫”称两位医护人员将文件袋拆下戴在头上以保护自己在朋友之前，我联系过张榜镇卫生院负责人张旭明。
Hubei filial piety, netizen "Gesanxiao Lich" said that two medical staff took the file bag off and put it on their heads to protect themselves before friends, I contacted Zhang Xu Ming, the director of Zhangbang Town Health Center.
当时他告诉我说，张榜镇卫生院高疑似感染病人12个，最缺防护服，“4天前领过一次N95口罩，每人2个，现在已经没有了。
At the time, he told me that Zhang Bang Town Health Center had 12 high-suspected-to-be-infected patients, most in need of protective clothing.
”如今几天过去了，也许有民间捐助的物资还在路上，但他已经不愿意对外公布疫情状况。
A few days later, perhaps with supplies from private donors still on the way, he was reluctant to disclose the disease.
狮子镇卫生院是一个相对较小的乡镇卫生院，暂时没有发现疑似感染病人，但是与刘河镇毗邻，属于高危地区。
Lion Town Health Center is a relatively small township hospital, temporarily no suspected infected patients, but with the town of Liu River adjacent to the high-risk areas.
他们的防护服、口罩使用也很紧张。
Their protective clothing and masks were also used nervously.
负责人说，“一次性防护服消消毒，第二天接着用；有的外科口罩一戴戴两天、三天，知道没有用也要继续戴。
"Disinfect disposable protective clothing and use it again the next day," the official said. "Some surgical masks are worn for two or three days and should be worn when they are no use.
”在大年初一，我给蕲春县十余个乡镇卫生院打了电话，大大小小，都是类似的情况。
"On the first day of the New Year, I telephoned the Agkistrodon Agkistrodon 10 Township Health Authorities on the first day of the New Year.
蕲春县的乡镇卫生院，他们往年，大都只是不专门开设“发热门诊”的小医院，只在特殊季节开设感染科。
In the past years, the Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Township Healthcare Clinic is only a small hospital that does not provide a "fever clinic." The Agkistrodon Agkistrodon only operates in special seasons.
今年1月20日前后，也就是腊月二十六日前后，在钟南山院士说新型肺炎病毒“明确人传人”之后，各乡镇卫生院开始接到上级通报，紧急开设感染科，或是开设发热门诊，收治病人。
Around January 20 this year, around the 26th of January, when academicians said the new pneumonia virus "clearly from person to person," township hospitals began to receive notification from their superiors, emergency opening of infection departments, or set up fever clinics to receive patients.
1月27日，武汉市武昌区粮道街昙华林社区干部通过手机安排工作（图/新华社）他们原本好像是被催眠了，一醒来，情况就恶劣得难以应对。
They were hypnotized on January 27 at Gangdaojie Hua Lin Community Cadre in Wuchang District, Wuhan City. They were hypnotized and when they woke up, the situation was unmanageable.
武汉“封城”，黄冈“封城”，蕲春“封县”，而整个县域内对抗疫情的医疗物资，缺乏得近乎裸奔。
The case of the Agkistrodon acutus in Wuhan, the "Agkistrodon acutus" in Wuhan, and the lack of medical supplies to combat the outbreak in the whole county are so close to being naked.
县城定点医院的感染科很快住满。
The infection department at the county hospital was quickly filled.
现在，乡镇卫生院只有重症病人才可以向上级汇报、转到定点医院，疑似病人向疾控中心申请，前来采样、确诊。
At present, township hospitals can only seriously ill patients can report to higher levels, to designated hospitals, suspected patients to apply to the CDC, to sample, diagnosis.
彼时，全中国的视线都在盯住武汉，但事实上，湖北不只有一个武汉。
At that time, the eyes of all China were fixed on Wuhan, but in fact, there is not only one Wuhan in Hubei Province.
从武汉出走的500万人口，有很大一部分是回到了这样的小县城、小村落中。
Wuhan from the five million people, a large part of the return to such small towns, small villages.
他们不止在蕲春县，也不止在黄冈市。
They are not only in Agkistrodon County, but also in Huanggang City.
网格乡村保卫战乡亲们，可能是管不住的。
Grid rural defense villagers, may not be able to control.
1月23日，也就是腊月二十九这天，陈家冲的村长陈子衡，很快打起了精神。
On January 23rd, the 29th of January, Chen Zi-heng, the village chief of Chen Jiachong, quickly picked up his spirits.
他统计完村里从武汉回来的人员名单，也要求给他们检测体温，做宣传教育，居家隔离，不让出门。
He counted the names of the villagers who had returned from Wuhan and asked to be given a temperature check, publicity and education, isolation and not to go out.
但还是有不听话的人。
But there are disobedient people.
村长打听到，那天一早，有陈家冲的村民在武汉“封城”之前，“逃”了回来，现在家里麻将桌围了三桌。
The village chief learned that early that day, Chen Jiachong villagers before Wuhan "closed the city," "fled" back, now the home Mahjong table surrounded three tables.
陈子衡决定去劝阻。
Chen Ziheng decided to dissuade him.
他出门没有口罩，问村卫生所的熟人要了一个。
He went out without a mask and asked acquaintances at the village clinic for one.
结果去了聚众打麻将的村民家里，里里外外，他是唯一一个戴口罩的人。
As a result, he was the only one to wear a mask, both inside and outside the home of the villagers who had gathered to play Mahjong.
陈子衡叫他们不要再打了，大家笑笑算了，不听。
Chen Zi Heng told them to stop fighting. They laughed and stopped listening.
有人给陈子衡支招，打110，当他们的面打。
Somebody gave Chen Zi Heng a move, hit 110, when they hit in front of them.
陈子衡没有这么做。
Chen did not do so.
但是看到聚众麻将就打110，成了村里一句“流行语”。
But to see the masses of Mahjong hit 110, has become a village "catchphrase."
我邻居家的女孩，是一个大学生，在微信群里告诉同宗族里的人，她的爸爸弟弟都是从武汉回来的，谁陪他们打麻将，她就打110。
My neighbor's girl, a college student, told people in her clan that her father and brother had come back from Wuhan, and whoever played Mahjong with them, she played 110.
陈子衡原本想在村广播里喊，叫大家不要聚众，春节电话拜年。
Chen Zi Heng had wanted to shout on the village radio that we should not gather together.
可是前阵子村里修电改线路，把广播线挖断了，他只能准备拿一副锣鼓，一条条路，一家家门口去喊。
But a few days ago the village to repair the power line, the broadcast line cut off, he can only be ready to take a set of gongs and drums, road, door to call.
Play四川眉山，为防止父母外出聚会，女儿拨打了110举报父母外出打牌好在，2019年的除夕，一夜之间，这块鄂东南土地上的农村，村村通变成了村村“封”。
In an effort to prevent parents from going out to parties, the daughter dialed 110 to report that parents were out playing cards. On New Year's Eve 2019, overnight in a rural area of southeastern Hubei, the village became a village "sealed."
村与村的道路，被土堆、砖墙、大卡车、大树捆，从物理上隔断了。
Villages and village roads are physically separated from each other by dirt heaps, brick walls, trucks and trees.
热情的村民们，像被卡在了一间又一间的小格子里。
Enthusiastic villagers are stuck in small compartments.
而乡镇卫生院，其实也是一个小格子，医务人员照看病人，同时自己被隔离，不能下乡。
The township hospital, in fact, is also a small lattice, medical personnel to care for patients, while being isolated, can not go to the countryside.
而县城的定点医院，又是另外的小格子。
And the county's designated hospital, is another small lattice.
几天的考虑，让我也慢慢理解了农村人在疫情初期的大流动。
A few days of consideration, let me also slowly understand the rural people in the early stage of the epidemic flow.
毕竟是新年。
After all, it's New Year.
大家在外务工一年回来，趁着这个时候办酒席，热闹人多，收的礼金也多一些；而一些买卖人，平素日给人赊账，过年对方手头上有钱了，家家户户上门去“讨”钱，自己也回来好过年；至于打麻将，这可能是一年之中唯一一个打麻将不会被老婆骂的时候了，此时不打，更待何时。
When they come back from a year as a migrant worker, they have a big feast, a lot of people and a little more money. But some buyers and sellers have money on credit and come home for the New Year. As for mahjong, it may be the only time in the year when he won't be scolded by his wife.
这些事情，多少年来，已经演变成了农村的习俗，在意识到新型肺炎的厉害之前，他们固有的行为很难改变。
These things, over the years, have evolved into rural customs that make it difficult to change their behavior until they realize the severity of the new form of pneumonia.
湖北黄冈，进村道路已经封闭，但背后“热烈欢迎在外乡亲回家过年”的条幅还没来得及撤下（图/财经杂志）只是很多人没想到，这一次不让人打麻将的，不是老婆，而是家里的儿子和女儿。
Huanggang, Huanggang, Huanggang, into the village has been closed, but behind the "Welcome Home" banners have not been removed (photo / financial magazine), but many people did not think that this time people do not play Mahjong, not the wife, but the family son and daughter.
一些受教育，爱上网的年轻人，面对“淡定”的父母“急得跳脚”，你说他没有卫生意识，他觉得你胆小、可笑，你叫他不要去拜年，他说你不懂人情世故、新年礼节。
Some educated, Internet-loving young people, faced with "calm" parents, you said he did not have hygiene awareness, he felt you timid, ridiculous, you told him not to visit the New Year, he said you do not understand the world, New Year's etiquette.
年轻人们联系起来，在微信群聊里游说父母，甚至恐吓父母，“管”住他们。
Young people connect, lobby their parents in microphone chats, and even intimidate their parents to "keep them in check."
年后，一道道的封锁，前所未有，让父母们也逐渐闻到了一些味道，他们也从朋友圈、村里、镇上、自己的朋友那里、政府发布的官方新闻里，接收到了一些信息。
More than ever before, the government has imposed an unprecedented blockade on parents, who have picked up information from friends, villages, towns, friends and official government news.
他们开始配合了。
They're starting to cooperate.
我家里比较奇怪，最先配合的竟然是奶奶。
My family is more strange, the first to cooperate with Grandma.
她戴着口罩坐在灶台旁，只露出一双眼睛，跟我说：“你吃饭莫坐在陈优旁边，他武汉回来的。
She sat by the stove wearing a mask, showing only a pair of eyes, and said to me: "You don't sit beside Chen You, he came back from Wuhan.
”陈优是我弟弟，她的大孙子。
"Chen You is my brother and her great-grandson.
1月27日，防疫人员在进行防疫消毒（图/新华社）今天再给一些乡镇卫生院负责人打电话，他们的物资匮乏相比过年前，得到了一点缓解，物资领取通道在建立。
January 27, epidemic prevention workers in the vaccination (picture / Xinhua) to some township health center officials today, their material shortages compared to the previous year, a little relief, material access is being established.
各个乡镇卫生院，每天下午向防控指挥部申报缺乏物资，得到专管副县长签字后，第二天中午可以获取一些物资。
Each township hospital, every afternoon to the control headquarters to declare a lack of supplies, the deputy prefect in charge of the signature, the next day at noon can get some supplies.
一些比较大的乡镇卫生院，会得到物资的输送，但因为县里物资也不够，一次只能领一天的用量。
Some of the larger township hospitals, supplies will be delivered, but because the county is not enough supplies, can only receive a day's dosage.
而一些小卫生院的负责人员，有物资来就亲自去县城跑一趟。
And some small health center responsible personnel, have material to come personally to the county run a trip.
他们要拿着一张通行证，通过一道又一道关卡，通过一条条空无人烟的街道，领到物资，再拿着另一张通行证回来。
They take one pass, pass another, pass through empty streets, receive supplies, and come back with another pass.
这样的日子不知道还有多久，这些道路也不知会封多久。
Such days do not know how long, these roads also do not know how long.
在一切结束之前，他们可能需要一直求救。
They may need help until it's all over.
