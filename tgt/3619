文/艾经纬3月16日晚，全球金融市场又是一场血雨腥风，固然多国禁止做空，多国央行宣布降息，但金融市场正陷入恐慌。
On the night of March 16, financial markets around the world are in a panic, with many countries banning short-selling and many central banks announcing interest rate cuts.
3月13日晚欧美股市还是热血沸腾，但一个周末过去刹那间巨熊再度袭来。
On the night of March 13, stock markets in Europe and the United States were agitated, but a weekend passed and the bear struck again.
截至3月16日晚9点半，标普500指数开盘暴跌8.14%，道琼斯指数跌了9.71%，再度触发熔断，早先开盘的欧洲股市更是一片暴跌，南非股指跌幅超过12%创下历史最大跌幅。
As of 9: 30 p.m. March 16, the S & P 500 had fallen 8.14%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 9.71%, triggering another meltdown, and earlier European stock markets had fallen sharply, with the South African index falling more than 12% by an all-time high.
巴菲特89岁所活久见的，年轻人在这一周都见到了。
Buffett was 89 years old and young people have seen it all this week.
我们还是先从A股投资者3月16日上午一开盘应该会有点蒙来说起，怎么没来个报复性的反弹呢？内有央行5500亿元定向降准，外有上周五（3月13日）晚美股标普500指数大涨9.29%，这是为什么？这个锅彻底地应该由美联储来背了。
Why not start with a retaliatory rally on the morning of March 16, when the US Standard & Poor's 500-stock index jumped 9.29% after a targeted $550 billion correction by the central bank.
原来，美联储3月15日突然大规模降息，将联邦基金利率目标区间大幅下调至0～0.25%，同时宣布7000亿美元的量化宽松计划（QE），包括回购5000亿美元国债和增持2000亿美元规模的抵押担保证券。
The Fed cut its federal funds rate target sharply to 0-0.25% on March 15, announcing a $700 billion program of quantitative easing (QE), including repurchase of $500bn of Treasury bonds and a $200bn increase in mortgage-backed securities.
这是美联储继3月3日紧急提前降息50个基点之后的再次紧急行动。
This is the Federal Reserve's emergency action following the March 3 emergency rate cut of 50 basis points ahead of schedule.
值得注意的是，这又是一次提前行动，原本在3月18日要召开议息会议，但现在提前抛出了王炸。
It is worth noting that this was another advance move, as the meeting was to have been held on 18 March, but it was thrown out in advance.
从政策配合上来讲，美联储此时抛出王炸可以理解，因为上周五特朗普一改前日的口风，开始发布一系列应对疫情的政策。
In terms of policy coordination, the Fed is understandably throwing Wang Bang at a time when Trump began to unveil a series of policies to deal with the epidemic as soon as he changed his tune on Friday.
这也是上周五美股市场报复性反弹的一个原因。
That was one reason for Friday's retaliatory rally in the U.S. stock market.
但从市场的角度来看，美联储这次是搬起石头砸了自己的脚。
But from a market perspective, the Fed is throwing stones at itself this time.
原本在上周五市场报复性反弹之后，市场很有可能会自行恢复平静，降低波动。
After Friday's retaliatory market rally, the market is likely to restore calm and reduce volatility.
但美联储突然抛出王炸，尤其是降至零利率，再加上超常规的7000亿美元QE，这意味着未来的政策空间有限了，要开始裸奔了。
But the Fed's sudden wrenching, especially to zero interest rates, coupled with its extraordinary $700 billion in QE, means that there will be limited policy space in the future to start running naked.
零利率和QE，都是2008年金融危机最危急的时候美联储的举措，而今在一个疫情面前抛出来了，能不让人对疫情的恐慌更加剧吗？美联储抛出王炸的结果就是，标普500指数期货在3月16日清晨开盘不到半小时就迅速暴跌，继而下跌4.79%触及熔断。
Zero interest rates and QE, both of which the Fed did at the height of the 2008 financial crisis, were thrown out in the face of an epidemic that could have exacerbated fears of an outbreak.
在美股期货再次熔断的情况下，全资产价格受到波及，连黄金白银都在下跌，其中白银价格跌破13美元/盎司，为2009年以来的新低，甚至都比开采成本要低了。
With U.S. stock futures melting down again, whole-asset prices are rippling, even for gold and silver, which has fallen below $13 an ounce, the lowest since 2009, and is even lower than the cost of extraction.
至于上周就崩的原油更是进一步崩，布伦特油价已经跌破32美元。
As for last week's collapse of crude oil is even more avalanche, Brent oil prices have fallen below $32.
流动性紧张之下，各种恐慌爆发出来，英国联合食品集团（ABF）的股价在3月16日因为一个乌龙指突然由1559便士跌至0.01便士(1镑=100便士)，被迫暂停交易，也就是说一个几十亿英镑市值的公司骤然可以用不到8万英镑买下，多么骇人听闻。
On March 16, shares in the UK food conglomerate ABF, suddenly dropped from 1559 pence to 0.01 pence (1 pound = 100p) as a result of a Oulong index, and was forced to suspend trading, meaning that a company worth billions of pounds could suddenly buy for less than 80,000 pounds.
至于A股市场，虽然3月16日上午10点国家统计局发布的1～2月份经济数据显示出疫情的冲击。
As for the A-share market, although March 16 at 10 a.m. the National Bureau of Statistics released 1-2 economic data shows the impact of the epidemic.
如1～2月份规模以上工业增加值同比下降13.5%；社会消费品零售总额52130亿元，同比下降20.5%；全国固定资产投资（不含农户）33323亿元，同比下降24.5%。
Total retail sales of consumer goods fell 20.5 percent year on year, with 3332.3 billion yuan in fixed assets investment (excluding farmers) nationwide, down 24.5 percent year on year.
但这基本都在预期之内，甚至比预期的还要好。
But it was mostly within expectations, or even better than expected.
加之3月13日多部委联合引发通知促进消费，同日央行又宣布定向降准5500亿元，其实是用心良苦，对冲3月16日上午发布的经济数据。
That, together with a multi-ministerial announcement on March 13 to boost consumption, led the central bank to announce a targeted cut of 550 billion yuan on the same day, effectively hedging the economic data released on the morning of March 16.
但即便是这样，还是被美联储适得其反的王炸政策给带下了沟。
But even so, the Fed's counter-productive policy of waging a bombing campaign has left a gulf.
投资本是基于事实和数据这两个基本维度，但投资的游戏却是在情绪的第三维和梦想的第四维上展开的。
Investment is based on two basic dimensions: facts and data, but the game of investing is played out in the fourth dimension of the third peacekeeping dream of emotions.
对于当前的金融市场来说，已经陷入了恐慌阶段，市场的心理也很微妙。
For today's financial markets, the panic phase, the market psychology is also very delicate.
从上周下半周起，自英国开始不断有央行跟进降息，全球主要央行都在联手注入流动性，但相对于疫情的恐慌来说，货币的宽松并不能解救生命。
Since the second half of last week, the UK has seen a steady stream of central banks follow suit, with the world's major central banks joining forces to inject liquidity, but monetary easing does not save lives relative to the panic.

Indeed, the most confident source of confidence for global financial markets today is the vaccine, written by veteran marketers such as Leveraged Black holes, et al. (Edited by Zhao Fangdi, proofread by Jing Ning).
