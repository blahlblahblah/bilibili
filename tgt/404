01.02.2020本文字数：2017，阅读时长大约4分钟导读：乘客减少、营运收入明显降低，“份子钱”成了出租车司机的痛。
Passengers decreased, operating income decreased significantly, and "molecular money" became a pain for taxi drivers.
作者 | 第一财经童兰 邱智丽 魏明明往年春节正月初六过后，众多城市迎来返程高峰。
Ricky Willis, the first financial magnate, has seen many cities return home after the Lunar New Year on June 6 last year.
但受新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情的影响，全国各大机场和火车站相比以往返程的客流明显减少，出租车行业的整体出勤率和营运收入出现下降现象。
However, due to the impact of the new coronavirus pneumonia, the major airports and railway stations around the country to significantly reduce the flow of passengers, taxi industry as a whole attendance and operating income decreased.
但司机依然需要缴纳“份子钱”，令他们承受极大的收入压力。
But drivers still have to pay "pocket money," putting enormous pressure on their incomes.
“份子钱”主要是出租车司机上缴给出租车公司的承包费用。
"Million Dollar" is mainly the taxi driver to pay the taxi company to contract fees.
第一财经记者了解到，目前上海四大出租车公司照收“份子钱”，对此司机颇有怨言。
The first financial reporter learned that at present Shanghai's four major taxi companies receive "money," the driver complained.
一位出租车司机对第一财经记者表示：“在机场等了7个小时才拉到客人！”第一财经记者致电上海市出租汽车协会，一位接听电话的人士称，正在就这一情况进行讨论。
"It took seven hours to get a visitor at the airport," a taxi driver told First Financial Correspondent, who called the Shanghai Taxi Association.
“我们正在开会讨论疫情防控的事情，现在（出租车）行业怎么安排的还没有确定，（补贴）有肯定是有，但目前还不方便透露。
"We are meeting to discuss the prevention and control of the epidemic and what the [taxi] industry is going to do," he said.
”据记者了解到，具体的补贴方案有望在数日公布 。
The details of the subsidy program are expected to be announced in the next few days, according to reporters.
不拉客人也要交“份子钱”“今天我父亲早上四点多出门，到下午五点，只做了200多元。
"" If you don't, you have to pay the money. "" Today my father went out at four o'clock in the morning, and at five o'clock in the afternoon, he did more than 200 yuan
”来自上海的王女士对第一财经记者说。
'Ms. Wang, from Shanghai, told leading financial reporters.
王女士的父母都是出租车司机，她告诉第一财经，受疫情影响每天人流量很少，但按照规定每天必须完成420元的营收指标，如果一个月不出车需要缴纳6300元的份子钱，如今母亲因为抵抗力弱已经不出车，父亲每天基本只能维持交份子钱，有时甚至还会亏损。
Ms. Wang, whose parents are taxi drivers, told First Finance that the epidemic affects only a small amount of people each day, but is required to meet a daily revenue target of 420 yuan. If she doesn't travel for a month and has to pay 6,300 yuan, her mother is now unable to travel because her resistance is weak.
“一些司机为了保证营收，只能去高铁、机场拉客。
"Some drivers have to go to the high-speed rail and airport to secure revenue.
他们也没有办法，只有这里有生意，于此同时，他们也承受着很大的心理压力，每天因为份子钱而发愁，又要担心疫情。
They have no choice but to have business here and, at the same time, they are under great psychological pressure, worrying about the money and worrying about the outbreak every day.
”王女士表示。
"said Mrs Wang.
第一财经记者向一位专跑机场的上海大众司机方面了解到，专跑机场近几天平均每天大约可以做三单，较平时数量明显减少。
The first financial reporter told a Shanghai Volkswagen driver who ran the airport that the airport had been able to make about three flights a day on average in recent days, a marked decrease from the usual number.
迫于营收，出租车运营乱象也开始出现。
Under the pressure of revenue, taxi operation chaos also began to appear.
一位乘客反应，在滴滴平台上呼叫了出租车，但司机打来电话反馈要收翻一倍的价钱。
One passenger responded by calling a taxi on a drip platform, but the driver called to double the price.
今日，第一财经记者致电大众出租车公司，对方就司机的份子钱怎么交以及疫情期间的司机工作安排做了回应：“司机按单班和双班分，份子钱每月一交，这个没有变化。
Today, the first financial reporter called the Volkswagen taxi company to answer questions about how the driver's money was paid and the driver's work arrangements during the epidemic.
司机是没有节假日的，除非找人顶班，单班做一休一，双班每天上班。
Drivers do not have holidays, unless someone to replace the shift, do a one-shift, double-shift daily work.
疫情爆发司机也是没有休息的，他们要自己保护好自己，具体政府是否会补贴，到时候再说。
The drivers of the outbreak have no rest, and they have to protect themselves, whether the specific government will subsidize, then wait.
”在记者采访中，司机呼吁，希望有关部门能够有效落实疫情期间的减免工作，同时能否在减少或者减免指标的基础上，给予一些补贴。
In an interview with reporters, the driver called on authorities to effectively implement relief efforts during the epidemic and whether they can provide some subsidies on the basis of targets for reduction or relief.
事实上，针对这一现状，兰州、西安已经采取了措施。
In fact, in view of this situation, Lanzhou, Xi'an has taken measures.
1月30日兰州市出租汽车行业协会发出《关于全力配合新型冠状病毒感染肺炎防控工作的倡议》，结合近期乘客减少、营运收入明显降低的实际，将主动减免出租汽车2020年2月(一个月)车辆承租金1000元。
On January 30, the Lanzhou Taxi Automobile Industry Association issued the "Initiative on the Prevention and Control of Pneumonia due to New Coronavirus Infection," combining with the recent reduction of passengers and a marked decrease in operating income, the LIAA will offer a voluntary reduction of the rental subsidy of 1,000 yuan (one month) for taxis in February 2020.
西安市出租汽车管理处、西安出租汽车协会发布关于减免承包费和服务费的通知指出，西安市所有出租汽车经营企业免除2020年2月（一个月）企业自有车辆承包费或任务金和个体工商户服务费。
Xi'an City Hire Car Administration Office, Xi'an Taxi Association issued a notice on the reduction of contract fees and service charges, said Xi'an City all taxi business enterprises exempted from February 2020 (one-month) enterprise-owned vehicles or task fees and services for individual businesses.
一位行业内的国企高层对第一财经记者表示：“出租车行业只是受疫情影响的行业之一，补贴如果参照非典时期的做法，那就是看政府如何统筹的，出租车企业很难自己说给补贴或者降租金。
"Taxi is just one of the industries affected by the epidemic and if we look at how the government co-ordinates it, taxi companies will have a hard time talking about subsidies or lowering rents themselves," one senior executive in the industry told First Financial.
”第一财经记者查看2003年的上海“非典”期间出租车行业的补贴情况显示，2003年5月，上海市出租车行业各企业补贴总额超过5000万元。
The first financial reporter looked at the subsidy from the taxi industry during the 2003 SARS epidemic in Shanghai and found that in May 2003, subsidies to enterprises in the sector totaled more than 50 million yuan.
而在行业补贴方案尚未出台之前，业内企业自行采取各项措施为司机营造良好的经营环境，增强企业凝聚力，比如强生公司设立了“抗非专项基金”，用于一线职工的奖励、慰问和困难救助；锦江公司预先补贴给驾驶员平均每人600元；大众公司免费向驾驶员提供午餐和夜宵；巴士公司预支了每人200元的补贴款等。
In the absence of an industry subsidy scheme, companies have taken their own measures to create a favorable business environment for drivers and enhance corporate cohesion. For example, Johnson & Johnson has set up a "special fund to fight Africa" for rewards, solicitations and hardship relief for frontline workers.
隔离措施各公司自行规定受新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情的影响，出租车司机的安全卫生如何保障，对于一些外地回沪的司机是否进行隔离，第一财经记者了解到，各大出租车公司的管理标准不尽相同。
Separating measures Each company has its own regulations on the impact of the new coronavirus pneumonia, how to ensure the safety and hygiene of taxi drivers, and whether some foreign drivers returned to Shanghai to be isolated, the first financial reporter learned that the standards of management of major taxi companies vary.
比如，大众出租车司机中外地回沪人员可以立刻上班，而其他的出租车公司据第一财经记者了解到，都需要主动隔离两周再上班。
For example, non-residents of Volkswagen taxi drivers can go to work immediately, while other taxi companies, according to the first financial reporter, need to be actively quarantined for two weeks before going to work.
对此，第一财经记者致电大众出租车客服人员。
In response, the first financial reporter called the public taxi service staff.
这位客服人员承认：“大众没有隔离外地回沪司机，有症状的才会被隔离。
The customer service staff admitted: "The masses do not isolate people back to Shanghai drivers, symptomatic people will be isolated.
而且现在湖北司机也回不来。
And now Hubei drivers can't get back.
”不过她也强调公司对司机采取了严格的防护措施。
But she also stressed that the company had taken strict precautions against drivers.
“我们的司机都会带口罩，每天车子里都会消毒，脚上的鞋子也要消毒。
"Our drivers wear masks, disinfect their cars every day and disinfect their shoes.
”大众的司机也向第一财经记者表示：“疫情期间，每天去公司报到，都会领一个口罩。
Volkswagen's driver also told First Financial Correspondent: "Every day during the outbreak, when you report to the company, you get a mask.
”不过也有上海出租车平台人士对记者表示，现在出租车驾驶员最缺的是安全保障，例如口罩问题，出租车公司通过各方筹措到一些口罩，但远远不能满足驾驶员实际需求。
But taxi drivers in Shanghai are most in need of safety measures, such as masks, and taxi companies are raising some face masks through various parties, but they are far from meeting drivers' real needs, people on Shanghai's taxi platforms told reporters.
一位网约车平台的管理人员也向第一财经记者表示，行业内对疫情的防控是非常严格的。
A manager of the online vehicle platform also told the first financial reporter that the prevention and control of the epidemic in the industry is very strict.
“比如我们节前就要求司机强制戴口罩，单单消毒，单后通风。
"For example, we ask drivers to wear masks before the festival, simply disinfect them and then ventilate them.
各地都配备了口罩和消毒站。
Masks and disinfection stations have been installed throughout the country.
”他告诉第一财经记者表示。
He told the first financial reporter.
在口罩和消毒剂紧缺的背景下，上述人士承认，该网约车平台目前储备的口罩和消毒剂已接近用完，正在紧急多渠道采购口罩和消毒剂补发各地。
Against the backdrop of a shortage of face masks and disinfectants, these people admitted that the current stock of face masks and disinfectants was running out and that emergency multi-channel procurement of masks and disinfectants was under way.
