作者 | 孔明明编辑 | 周昶帆原本，在很多旅游行业从业者的预期中，2020年春节应该是丰收的时节。
At the beginning of its service, many tour operators expected the 2020 Spring Festival to be a bumper harvest.
但一场疫情改变了超4亿人的旅行计划，也给旅游行业超过1000万的从业者带来了巨大损失。
But an epidemic has changed the travel plans of more than 400 million people and has taken a heavy toll on more than 10 million workers in the tourism industry.
从1月23日武汉宣布“封城”后，民航局、铁路局、文化与旅游部等相关部门接连下发通知，在要求时间内可免费退票、停止团队旅游出行、停止包括出境游在内的“机+酒”服务、景区停止营业、禁止群体性聚集活动……每一天、每一条信息的公布，对旅游行业的所有从业者来说，都影响巨大。
Since the announcement of the "closure" of Wuhan on January 23, relevant departments such as the Civil Aviation Administration, Railway Bureau, Ministry of Culture and Tourism have issued a series of circulars, which can be refunded free of charge within the required time.
在这期间，创业者们彻夜难眠、客服们每天连续工作超过12个小时、景区从业者欲哭无泪、旅行社导游在家等待复工、OTA平台安抚用户和供应商的同时还需要不断垫付巨额资金。
During this time, entrepreneurs have to spend sleepless nights, customer service workers working more than 12 hours a day, tour operators crying, tour guides waiting at home to get back to work, OTA platforms to reassure users and suppliers, and huge upfront payments.
“全国有2万多家旅行社，40万到50万的从业人员，超过10万家酒店，接近100万间的住宿设施，几乎一夜之间全都陷入了停顿。
"There are more than 20,000 travel agencies, 400,000 to 500,000 employees, more than 100,000 hotels and nearly a million accommodation facilities, all of which came to a standstill almost overnight.
总体算下来，光是旅游行业在春节期间就有1万亿的GDP损失了。
Overall, the tourism industry alone lost $1 trillion in GDP during the Spring Festival.
酒店、景区商户、航空公司等有超过1000万的从业人员，将在未来三、四个月的时间没有工作。
Hotels, resorts and airlines, with more than 10 million employees, will be out of work in the next three to four months.
”同程集团创始人吴志祥在一次公益直播中称。
Wu Zhixiang, founder of the same group, said in a pro bono broadcast.
对于旅游业来说，受到人口聚集性、季节性、社交性等种种因素影响，春节出行和旅游基本能占旅游公司全年营收的1/4左右。
For tourism, due to the population density, seasonality, social factors and other factors, Spring Festival travel and tourism can account for about 1 / 4 of the annual revenue of tourism companies.
据中国旅游研究院公布的数据显示，2019年春节假期全国旅游接待总人数4.15亿人次，实现旅游收入5139亿元。
According to figures released by the China Tourism Institute, the total number of tourist arrivals for the Spring Festival in 2019 reached 415 million, bringing the total to 513.9 billion yuan.
“如果按照乐观估计，三个月绝收期减少60%，三个月恢复期减少30%来计算，全国旅游业预计今年损失接近3万亿元。
"If the three-month closure period is reduced by 60 per cent and the three-month recovery period by 30 per cent, according to optimistic estimates, the national tourism industry is expected to lose nearly 3 trillion yuan this year.
”北京大学旅游研究与规划中心主任吴必虎在接受媒体采访时说道。
Wu Bighu, director of the Beijing University's Center for Tourism Research and Planning, told reporters.
每个人都知道，疫情过后，旅游行业必定会迎来“报复性”爆发和增长。
Everyone knows that after the epidemic, the tourism industry is bound to see a "retaliatory" outbreak and growth.
但据清华、北大联合调研的数据显示，34%的中小企业账上余额只能维持1个月，33.1%的企业可以维持2个月，17.91%的企业可以维持3个月。
However, according to Tsinghua and Peking University joint research, 34% of SMEs can maintain their balance for only one month, 33.1% for two months, and 17.91% for three months.
中小企业账上余额能够维持的时间来源 /中欧商业评论头部平台推出了针对供应商的低息贷款计划、投资人表示这是企业可以修炼内功和冷静思考的好机会、从业者重新思考商业模式并发力线上。
Central European Business Review Head Platform launched a low-interest loan program for suppliers. Investors say it is a good opportunity for companies to hone their internal skills and soberly think, and for practitioners to rethink business models and power lines.
同时，多位采访对象也向燃财经表示，他们正在计划与文化和旅游部沟通，请求政府给予更多支持和帮扶。
At the same time, several interviewees told Flaming Finance that they were planning to communicate with the Ministry of Culture and Tourism to ask for more government support and assistance.
“春天总会来的”，在等待的煎熬中，他们一边艰难自救，一边安慰着自己。
"Spring will come," in the torment of waiting, they are difficult to help themselves, while consoling themselves.
突如其来的疫情1月23日，51BOOK的CEO杨锐还在公司上班。
The sudden outbreak January 23, 51 BOOK CEO Yang Rui is still working at the company.
作为一家年交易额在40亿左右的机票在线预订平台，51BOOK在当天有近2000万交易额，已经提前完成了月度KPI，他和员工还为此在公司举办了一个小的庆祝仪式。
With nearly 20 million transactions on the day, 51BOOK completed its monthly KPI ahead of schedule as an online booking platform with an annual turnover of about $4bn, and he and his staff held a small celebration at the company.
公司2019年整体业务保持40%增长的前提下，他们对2020年充满了期待。
With the company's overall business growing by 40% in 2019, they are looking forward to 2020.
但所有的喜悦和期盼在23号晚上全部戛然而止。
But all the joys and expectations came to an abrupt end on the evening of the 23rd.
1月23日晚，民航局宣布自24日起，此前已购买民航机票的旅客可免费自愿退票。
On the evening of 23 January, the Civil Aviation Authority announced that, from 24 January, passengers who had previously purchased airline tickets would be entitled to a free voluntary refund.
当时杨锐和行业内的许多从业者紧急组建了一个微信群，在群内慌忙讨论对策。
Yang Rui and many practitioners in the industry at the time urgently formed a micro-group, in the group hastily discussed countermeasures.
“那个时候我们只知道业务不能干了，会有大量的团队要取消机票，春节期间原来旺季要挣钱的想法完全落空，可能这都不是赔钱的问题，而是要考虑企业生死存亡的问题。
"We knew then that business was not going to work, that there would be teams that would cancel tickets and that the idea of making money during the Spring Festival season would be completely lost. It probably wasn't a question of losing money, it was a question of survival
”杨锐说。
'he said.
在1月25日之前，四川某亲子游OTA平台创始人杨威和很多供应商正在准备迎接春节人流的到来。
Before Jan. 25, Yang Wei, founder of a parent-child travel OTA platform in Sichuan, and many suppliers are preparing to welcome the Spring Festival crowd.
依照去年的估算，平台上整个春节仅四川旅游市场就有将近8万人员的流动，庙会、灯节、亲子活动都已经准备就绪，蓄势待发。
According to last year's estimates, the entire Spring Festival on the platform in Sichuan alone nearly 80,000 people in the travel market, temple fairs, Lantern Festival, parent and child activities are ready to be launched.
比机票平台稍晚一步，25日杨威和他的供应商们直接接到了来自当地政府的紧急电话。
A little later than the ticket platform, Yang Wei and his suppliers received an emergency call from the local government on the 25th.
电话传传达的信息是，自1月25日起，四川省内所有景区及文化广电场所暂停营业，并同时停止大型群众型聚集活动等。
The message was that all scenic spots and cultural and radio stations in Sichuan province had been suspended since January 25, and large-scale mass gatherings had been halted.
2019年，杨威的公司营收约2亿人民币，按计划，春节黄金期的营收会占到整年营收的30%。
In 2019, Mr. Yang's company will generate about 200 million yuan in revenue, which is expected to account for 30% of annual revenue during the Spring Festival holiday.
“最开始收到疫情消息时，没想到会这么严重，23日当天只是处理了一下武汉分公司的一些情况。
"When I first received the news of the outbreak, I didn't expect it to be so serious.
”大年三十晚上，家人吃年夜饭，杨威独自呆在房间里打电话处理问题。
On the eve of New Year's Eve, when his family had Chinese New Year's Eve dinner, Yang Wei stayed alone in his room to fix problems.
和杨威类似，去买票CEO张寒枫23日在朋友圈看到武汉“封城”消息之后，心里想着“糟糕，湖北景区肯定没法营业了”。
Similar to Yang Wei, to buy tickets CEO Zhang Han Feng 23 in the circle of friends saw Wuhan "closed city" after the news, thinking "bad, Hubei scenic spots can not be business.
作为一家为景区提供管理类SAAS软件的创业公司，经过4年的努力，他们已经拥有了2400多家景区客户。
As a start-up company providing management-like SAAS software for scenic spots, they have more than 2,400 customers after four years of effort.
在春节前三天，他们每天的交易额流水在1.2亿人民币左右。
Their daily turnover during the three days before the Spring Festival is around 120 million yuan.
而在25日景区停业的通知下发后，去买票的客户陆续开始关闭景点，用户也陆续开始退票。
After the 25 th notice of the closure of the scenic spot, customers began to buy tickets began to close attractions, users began to refund tickets.
26日他们的日流水已经跌至400多万元，“心都凉了”，张寒枫说，“我们有一个河北做庙会的客户，两个多亿的前期投入都打了水漂，甚至有一个花海景区的客户直接瘫倒了，整个人都傻眼了。
"Their daily running water had dropped to more than 4 million yuan, 'Zhang said.' We have a temple fair customer in Hebei, where more than two billion of the initial investment was in vain.
”图 / 视觉中国对于旅游行业来说，人流密集、时效性都很重要，“就算疫情过去了，大家也没法连续放7天假，对景区来说，时间就是金钱，整个损失是没办法挽回的。
Figure / Vision China is very important to the tourism industry in terms of people density and timeliness. "Even if the epidemic is over and no one can take seven days off in a row, time is money for the scenic area and the whole loss cannot be undone."
”张寒枫说。
'she said.
因为覆盖面积更广，大型OTA反应速度比行业从业者要更快一些。
Because it has a wider footprint, large OTAs react faster than industry practitioners.
1月20日，马蜂窝创始人陈罡还在公司处理一些重点项目的年终盘点，当时媒体上陆续出现关于疫情的报道，虽然“大众对疫情区域的认知还停留在初级阶段”，但陈罡意识到“这次疫情没那么简单”，当天晚上，陈罡还着重确认了春节期间客服、技术等部门的值班情况。
On January 20, the company's founder, Kanggang Chan, was working on the end-of-year inventory of some key projects. Although "public awareness of the epidemic area is still at an early stage," Kanggang realized that "the epidemic is not so simple." That night, Kanggang also highlighted the customer service, technology and other departments on duty.

从1月23日起，整个旅游行业仿佛被按下了“暂停”和“Hard模式”按钮。
From January 23, the entire travel industry seems to have been pushed the "pause" and "hard" button.
数百万张退订单“根本反应不过来，疫情发展太快”，皇包车旅行创始人孟磊说。
Millions of refunds are "simply unresponsive and the epidemic is spreading too fast," said Meng Lei, founder of the royal charter tour.
1月24日，文化和旅游部宣布暂停所有团队旅游及“机+酒”旅游产品。

”孟磊说。
"said Meng Lei.
从1月24日到27日，“没日没夜地赶，端着饭碗还在开会，”孟磊说着说着想掉泪，“每天大家都是凌晨四五点睡，早上八九点多又爬起来。
"From January 24 to 27," day and night, carrying the rice bowl is still in the meeting, "Meng Lei said, trying to tears." Every day we sleep four or five in the morning, and get up again at eight or nine in the morning.
”对于主营业务是境外中文接送机、包车、定制游的皇包车旅行来说，晚上要跟境外合作伙伴沟通，白天跟客户沟通，“大家整体处于接近崩溃的状态”。
"For overseas Chinese-language pick-ups, charter cars and custom-made royal charters, communicating with overseas partners at night and with customers during the day," everyone is on the verge of collapse. "
“你知道每天回微信回到手指头发热是什么感觉吗？而且我们合作的旅行社等商户每条信息都在问我：为什么不给我们退款？不退款的话我们怎么办？”孟磊说。
"Do you know what it's like to go back to your fingertips and get hot every day? And the travel agency we work with asks me: Why not give us a refund? What do we do without a refund?" said Meng Lei.
从初一到初三，本来仅安排了11个人值班的张寒枫，临时动员员工在家办公，退掉了300多万张景区门票，“当时把我们的研发人员都当售后来用，全都保持在线，主动联系客户是否需要我们在后台帮助他们进行批量退款”，短短几天，去买票的日流水从1.2亿跌至10万多元，“断崖式地下跌”。
From the first to the third day of junior high school, Zhang Han Feng, who had only 11 people on duty, temporarily mobilized staff to work from home and returned more than 3 million tickets to the scenic area.

Chart / Vision China "For the tourism industry as a whole and China as a whole, this situation is unprecedented.
”陈罡告诉燃财经。
Kanggang told Flaming Finance.
除了动员全公司力量缓解客服压力之外，他自己甚至在微博上回复了大多数来自用户的私信，一方面帮助他们操作退改，一方面争取他们的体谅和支持，“每天只能保持三至四个小时的睡眠。
In addition to mobilizing the company's efforts to relieve customer-care stress, he even responded to most personal letters from users on Weibo, helping them navigate the retreat and gaining their understanding and support. "Only three to four hours of sleep a day.
”对OTA平台来说，更早的时候，他们已经开始感受到了退单的压力。
For the OTA platform, they were already feeling the pressure to return tickets earlier.
1月20号晚上，国家卫健委高级别专家组组长、中国工程院院士钟南山接受央视新闻采访时第一次对外透露：“根据目前的资料，新型冠状病毒肺炎肯定存在人传人。
"According to current data, there must be human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus pneumonia," Zhong Nan-shan, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and head of the high-level group of experts, told CCTV
”采访播出后，客服电话、退订单瞬间开始涌来。
After the interview, customer service phone calls and order rejections suddenly began to pour in.
“最开始酒店退单是一单一议，客户打进来，我们跟酒店协商”，携程CEO孙洁称。
"At first, the hotel return is a single negotiation, customers call in, we negotiate with the hotel," said Ctrip CEO Sun Jie.
随着疫情发展，波及范围很快从武汉扩展至全国，客服电话全线占满，“一开始刚上量的时候，几千个人在线排队，大家都骂为什么携程电话打不进去”，携程相关业务负责人称。
As the epidemic spread quickly from Wuhan to the whole country, customer service lines were full. "At the outset, thousands of people lined up online to scold why Ctrip couldn't get through," said the company's chief of operations.
22日携程连夜上线酒店“安心取消保障”计划，让用户可以自助线上取消，不需要经过人工客服。
The 22-day Ctrip online hotel "Ease of mind cancel protection" plan, so that users can cancel online self-help, do not need to go through manual customer service.
对这些参与计划的酒店，携程许诺会在主APP中对他们做重点推荐，在疫情结束后，给予包括疫后“爱心酒店”标签和亿级营销资源，目前已有40万家酒店参与这一计划。
For the participating hotels, Ctrip promises to focus on them in the main APP, and to give them marketing resources, including the Loving Hotels label and 100 million grade marketing resources after the outbreak, with 400,000 hotels participating in the program.
当时业务还没有蔓延到海外，“但我们也做了假设，几乎联系了所有大的酒店集团，最终全球六大集团率先加入，其他海外本土酒店也会陆续跟上”，孙洁说。
The business had not yet spread overseas, "but we also assumed that almost all major hotel groups would be contacted and eventually six global conglomerates would take the lead and other overseas local hotels would follow," Sun said.
据了解，春节期间飞猪平台客服热线峰值时达到去年同期10倍。
It is understood that during the Spring Festival Pig platform peak service hotline reached 10 times the same period last year.
来自携程的数据也显示，截止到1月29日携程平台收到的退改诉求总量、咨询总量都达到数百万的量级，相较去年春节，增幅达到405%，最高峰值时增幅达到650%，客服上班时间平均为13个小时。
Data from Ctrip show that the total number of retirement claims and inquiries received by Ctrip as of Jan. 29 reached millions of orders of magnitude, 405% higher than last year's Spring Festival, 650% at peak and an average of 13 hours for customer service.
同程艺龙相关负责人表示，为了应对疫情带来的退订潮，同程艺龙几乎所有可用的客服人力全部到岗。
Cheng Yilong related responsible person said, in order to deal with the epidemic caused by the withdrawal tide, almost all available customer service personnel of the same Cheng Yilong to the post.
但这些依然不能缓解来自数百万张退订单的客服压力。
But that still doesn't ease customer-service pressure from millions of rejections.
“相关部门在疫情爆发后的数天内连续推出了11项各种政策，每一次都会引发新的退改订单潮，订单数量成倍增长，全部处理完成需要时间”，携程相关负责人称，“由于免费退票的特殊性，从提交、审核再到退款，需要一定的甄别时间，当退订量突然集中爆发，航空公司以及其他相关企业甚至还没来得及拟定政策时，层层审核积压下来，时间只会更长。
"The authorities have launched 11 successive policies in the days following the outbreak, each time triggering a new wave of rejections, which have multiplied and taken time to complete," said Ctrip official. "Because of the special nature of free refunds, it takes a certain amount of time to process them.
”“很多客服在接电话之前，会先把耳机离开耳朵，在客人骂完之后再解释，甚至有客服会先自己给用户退款”，上述负责人说，直至现在，“受海外航空公司停飞、各国政府陆续出台限制中国公民入境政策影响，国际机票退改需求依然居高不下，预计需要1～2周才能清理完毕。
"Many customers leave their earphones behind their ears before answering phones, explaining it after the caller has scolded them, or even refunding customers themselves," the official said. "Until now," demand for international ticket cancellations has remained high and is expected to take a week or two to clear.
”自救，自救，自救退订单依然没有停止，行业暂时停摆，现金流是这个时候所有企业关注的重点。
"Self-help, self-help, self-help return order has not stopped, the industry has temporarily stopped, cash flow is the focus of all enterprises at this time.
此前，去哪儿网CEO陈刚在接受媒体采访时表示，“如今不仅平台方面现金流吃紧，代理商乃至航空公司同样吃紧”，去哪儿网各业务线已经为消费者即时退款垫资近十亿元，陈罡称马蜂窝为消费者退订垫资也已经超5亿人民币。
In an interview with the media, Chen Gang, CEO of the company, said: "Not only are cash flow tight on platforms, agents and even airlines are also under tight pressure." Where to go to the various lines of business has already paid nearly 1 billion yuan in immediate refund to consumers.
杨威则称，如果6个月后公司依然不能正常运转，准备开始走公司清算流程。
Mr Yang said the company was ready to start liquidating if it did not function properly after six months.
“行业上下游企业资金几乎全面锁死，悲观、焦虑、无助正在蔓延到每一个旅游人。
"The industry upstream and downstream business funds almost completely locked up, pessimism, anxiety, helplessness is spreading to every tourist.
”杨锐说。
'he said.
针对各行业所面临的困难，地方政府陆续开始推出补贴和扶持政策，但多位受访者表示，这些政策目前还很难快速落地。
Local governments have begun to introduce subsidies and support policies in response to the difficulties faced by various sectors, but many interviewees said these policies are still difficult to land quickly.
“只能先自救”，杨威说。
"Help yourself first," Yang said.
从1月26日开始，杨威召集了公司高管，连续在线开会，并在1月30日给所有员工发送了一封邮件，通知要对公司员工进行优化，暂停2020年原定的新业务，能调岗的员工可以选择调岗，否则自己选择离职。
From January 26, Mr. Yang called executives together for online meetings, and on January 30 sent an e-mail to all employees informing them to optimize their work force, suspend new business planned for 2020, and opt to relocate staff who otherwise chose to leave.
“我们也没有办法，如果不这么做，公司直接就完了。
"We don't have a choice. If we don't do this, the company is dead.
”目前，他的公司已经优化了近1/3左右的人员。
His company has so far optimized nearly a third of its workforce.
另一方面，杨威的公司以前更多依赖于线下，现在考虑慢慢把业务往线上进行转变，根据C端用户需求开发一些产品，“对原有的商业模式进行一些变化。
Mr. Yang's company, on the other hand, which used to rely more on offline, is now thinking about slowly moving its business online, developing some products based on the needs of C-end users and making "some changes to the old business model."
”在1月28日差不多处理完公司所有的退订单之后，孟磊终于缓了一口气，开始思考如何自救、如何安排员工、如何发放工资、怎么还银行贷款、如何筹措资金等种种问题。
After handling nearly all the company's return orders on January 28, Mr. Meng breathed a sigh of relief and began to think about how to save himself, how to arrange staff, how to pay salaries, how to repay a bank loan and how to raise money.
“从1月28号到现在，我每天的工作就是跟投资人、合作伙伴、员工们不停地聊”。
"From January 28 to the present, my daily job is to talk to investors, partners and employees."
“目前银行有可能能延期贷款还款，但合作伙伴大部分来自国外，很难沟通”，孟磊说，“跟员工商量缓发工资，有的员工告诉我他们家刚生完二胎几个月，这个时候你还好意思说什么？只能说我给你发了。
"Banks are likely to postpone loan repayments for now, but most of the partners are from abroad and it's hard to communicate," Meng said.
你还能说第二句话吗？你不能说。
Can you say the second sentence? You can't say that.
”虽然皇包车旅行已经完成C+轮融资、有十几个投资方，但“目前投资人出手的可能性很低，因为他们有几百个投资项目，帮谁不帮谁？”孟磊说，在这个过程中，让他最难受的事情是，“如果有些事情通过努力能够改变，我们还可以努力。
Although royal chartered trips have been completed with a dozen investors in the C + round, "the odds are low that investors are selling because they have hundreds of investment projects, and who won't help?" Meng said the worst thing about the process is that "if something can change through hard work, we can still work on it."
但现在没有一条缝可以留给我们。
But there is no seam left for us now.
”图 / 视觉中国游磬基也认为，旅游行业上半年基本所有的投资会被冰封，没人敢出手，即便有人出手，也是别的行业手握现金流的公司，但那个时候“是收购而不是投资”。
ImpressionChina agrees that while most of the tourism industry's investments in the first half of the year will be frozen, no one will dare to act, and if anyone does, it will be cash-flow companies in other industries, it will be "acquisitions, not investments."
“对于旅游企业来说，如果在这个过程中做得非常煎熬，我建议有被收购的机会就赶紧卖掉”，游磬基说。
"For tourism companies, if it's a very ordeal in the process, I suggest selling it as soon as there's a chance," says Unicorn.
张寒枫目前想到的自救方法是帮助景区做打折预售，回收一部分现金流；或者有IP化的景区，可以通过线上营销或者互动游戏，来进行获客。
Zhang Han Feng now think of self-help is to help scenic areas do discount sales, recovery of part of cash flow; or IP scenic spots, through online marketing or interactive games, to receive visitors.
针对不同的类别，去买票把客户划分为不同类别，有室内、室外、活动主题、滑雪等，给到他们不同的活动方案。
For different categories, to buy tickets to divide customers into different categories, indoor, outdoor, event themes, skiing, and so on, to give them a different program of activities.
“只有你的客户在线，公司才能在线”。
Only if your customers are online can the company be online.
在华住集团创始人季琦2月2日发给员工的内部信中，季琦称，目前华住的应对之策是不裁员、不鼓励关店歇业等。
Jiqi, founder of Jiqi Group, said in an internal letter to employees on February 2, Qi said the current solution is not to lay off workers, do not encourage the closure of stores, and so on.
但这一应对之策是以2-3个月左右疫情基本结束或者得到有效控制为假设。
But this response is predicated on the assumption that the epidemic is largely over or effectively contained within two to three months.
季琦称，在正常情况下，华住门店仅一线员工的人力成本每人每月要6000元左右，10万员工，每月是6个亿。
In normal times, says Qizhi, the human cost of front-line workers in Chinese stores is about 6,000 yuan per person per month, 100,000 employees and 600 million people per month.
假如疫情进一步恶化，或疫情时间超过3个月以上，华住在用工问题上有可能需要进一步调整。
If the epidemic worsens further, or if the epidemic lasts more than three months, it is likely that China will need to further adjust its employment situation.
比如调休、部分上班、仅发基础工资、暂缓支付社保养老保险等。
For example, transfer to work, part of the work, only basic wages, deferred payment of social security pension insurance.
熬下去，活下去与此同时，头部平台也在为行业做力所能及的工作。
At the same time, the head platform is doing what it can for the industry.
在全国范围内的退订需求开始出现后，携程启动了1个亿的保障金计划。
Ctrip launched a $100 million guarantee plan after nationwide demand began to recede.
1月26日文化和旅游部宣布全国暂停境内外跟团游和“机票+酒店”半自助旅游产品后，携程把保障金金额提到2亿，携程下线2月29日前的此类产品，此前已经下单的自由行、玩乐、用车、定制游、景区等产品无损全退。
On January 26, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism announced a nationwide moratorium on package tours and semi-self-service package tours and "air tickets + hotels."
消费者退款均由携程垫付，供应商根据自己的损失提交证明材料，携程承担成本部分的损失；1月29日，携程宣布对旗下8000家携程旅行社加盟店，宣布减免三个月管理费，延期任务额度。
On January 29, Ctrip announced a three-month reduction in management fees and an extension of its mandate for its 8,000 Ctrip travel agency franchises.
有从业者表示，对于携程要求供应商提供的损失证明材料，供应商们很难提供，并且担心携程会不退真金白银而是以广告费方式返还，“但我撑不到那天现金流已经断了。
Some practitioners say it is hard for suppliers to provide proof of the loss that Ctrip requires from its suppliers, and worry that Ctrip will return the money in the form of an ad, 'but I can't make it through that day.
”携程方面则表示，损失证明材料是帮助供应商定损，并不难提供，例如机票、酒店等都有预订证明。
For its part, Ctrip said the loss-proof materials, such as airline tickets and hotel bookings, were not difficult to provide to help suppliers fix their losses.
也有从业者表示，OTA们追求的“尽一切可能无损退订”，是在追求更多的企业社会责任，事实上抬高了整个行业的经营门槛，也会让供应商与平台之间，就新的规则开始长期的碰撞与沟通。
There are also practitioners who say that OTA's pursuit of "doing everything possible to unscathed" is in pursuit of greater corporate social responsibility, effectively raising the industry's operating threshold and allowing long-term collisions and communication between suppliers and platforms over the new rules.
2月5日，携程宣布向其平台上的机票、酒店、旅游度假等领域合作伙伴推出“同袍”计划，包括10项具体措施，投入10亿元合作伙伴支持基金和100亿元额度小微贷款，帮助供应商为用户垫付退款，以此来缓解其资金压力；2月6日，华住集团宣布紧急开放低息贷款，面向已开业一年以上且仍在营业的旗下酒店，华住可提供单店最高50万元的低息贷款支持。
On February 5, Ctrip announced that it would launch a "robe" program for its partners in airline tickets, hotels, vacations and other sectors, including 10 concrete measures. On February 6, China Housing Group announced the urgent opening of low-interest loans to hotels that have been open for more than a year and are still open.
而对于很多旅游行业的从业者来说，如何解决眼前生计也是很大的问题。
For many tourism industry workers, how to solve the immediate livelihood is also a big problem.
有旅行社创始人表示，“导游基本没有底薪，一些老导游可以在家卖特产维持生计，而新导游可能会没有任何收入，”也有人表示，“这行业太看天吃饭了，甚至想转行”。
"Tourist guides don't have a basic salary, some old guides can sell specialty products at home and the new ones may not have any income," said the founder of a travel agency.
而在2月5日，文化和旅游部推出向旅行社暂退部分旅游服务质量保证金的方案，对旅行社行业从业者来说，无疑是一个利好。
On 5 February, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism launched a scheme to temporarily refund certain travel service quality guarantees to travel agents, which is undoubtedly a positive development for travel agents.
在梁建章看来，旅游行业在疫情问题中的第一阶段，是处理用户服务、跟进海量订单的阶段；而第二个阶段是惨淡时期，“如何保证队伍和公司财务状况的稳定性，是企业在这一阶段需要面对的问题。
In Liang's view, the first stage of the epidemic in the tourism industry is the processing of user services and the follow-up of large orders. The second phase is a bleak one. "How to ensure the stability of the team and the company's financial situation is a problem that enterprises need to face at this stage."
”梁建章说。
"said Liang Jianzhang.
在17年前的非典时期，携程几乎保留了所有员工，采用员工轮休的方式进行运转，同时，趁着业务低迷的时间，携程在内部举行了大量的培训和业务流程优化，提升员工的能力。
During the SARS epidemic 17 years ago, Ctrip retained almost all its staff and took advantage of the downturn to conduct extensive in-house training and business process optimization to improve staff capabilities.
而在非典结束之后的第一个月，旅游行业就迎来了“报复性增长”。
And in the first month after the end of SARS, the tourism industry ushered in "retaliatory growth."
当年12月，携程成功在纳斯达克敲钟。
In December of that year, Ctrip successfully sounded the bell on NASDAQ.
“参考非典的情况，疫情之后旅游行业一定会迎来业务井喷。
"In the light of SARS, the tourism industry is sure to see a business boom after the epidemic.
但这之前一定会出现有些公司业务停摆和资金断流的情况，各方面都在考验企业自身的综合实力。
But before this, there will be a number of companies and the suspension of funds, all aspects of the test of the comprehensive strength of the enterprise itself.
”杨锐说。
'he said.
对于51BOOK来说，2015年机票代理行业的“提直降代”政策，影响甚至要大过这次疫情。
For 51 BOOK, the 2015 airline ticket agency industry "straight down" policy, even more than the impact of the epidemic.
“那次对行业的影响无亚于地震，2/3的企业基本被清理出局，而疫情只是阶段性的。
"That period did not less affect the industry than the earthquake, with two thirds of the businesses largely wiped out, while the epidemic was only phased out.
在2015年51BOOK逆市融资4.38亿人民币，目前公司账上仍有上亿现金。
In 2015 51 BOOK counter-market financing of 438 million yuan, the company still has hundreds of millions of cash.
理论上只要我们把业务稳住，把客户服务好、留住，至少能扛一年。
Theoretically as long as we stabilize the business, customer service, retention, at least for a year.
”图 / Pexels杨锐告诉燃财经，从这次疫情中，他们也发现公司有很多地方需要反思。
Figure / Pexels Yang tells Flaming Finance that from the outbreak, they have also found that there is much to reflect on.
比如对于业务峰值的处理预估不够、一些业务板块抗风险能力不够等，“未来我们在业务上会加强跨行业的投资布局和海外业务投入，来对冲旅游行业的风险。
For example, the management of business peaks is not sufficiently estimated, and some business sectors are not sufficiently risk-resistant. "In the future we will strengthen cross-industry investment distribution and overseas investment to hedge tourism sector risks."
”“对于很多旅游公司来说，这次疫情也是试金石”，游磬基认为。
"For many travel companies, the epidemic is also a touchstone," he said.
在他看来，旅游业的现金流管理因为有大量的预付和预收款，比较复杂，跟一般的制造业和服务业都不一样，“旅游行业的创始人，绝大部分人不太理解自由现金流的概念是什么，过去五年倒闭的很多创业公司也是死在这一点上”，游磬基说，“照现在这种情况，如果疫情依然不能得到有效控制，即便是大公司的现金流都有可能支撑不了半年。
In his view, cash-flow management in the tourism industry is complicated by large upfront and advance receipts, unlike the general manufacturing and service industries. "Most of the founders of the travel industry don't understand the concept of free cash flow, and many startups that have failed over the past five years die," he said.
”吴志祥在公益直播课上称，“非典”时期，在所有的线下旅游门店都歇业的情况下，同程反而成为了一个旅游从业者非常喜欢登录和聚集的平台。
Wu Zhixiang, in a pro bono lecture, said the same trip became a popular platform for tour operators to log in and congregate when all the offline travel outlets were shut down.
“危机对每一个企业都是平等的，相当一部分企业会在野火燃烧的过程中死去，但只有生命力更强的树木，它才可能长出新芽。
"The crisis is equal for every business, and quite a number of companies will die from wildfires, but only more viable trees can sprout new shoots."
”1月27日晚上，在基本处理完公司所有退订单之后，孟磊终于有空开始面对公司现状，“人在忙着的时候，只顾着组织大家退款，但等问题基本解决后，开始算手头钱的时候，我基本就崩溃了”。
On the night of January 27, after basically handling all the company's return orders, Meng Lei finally had time to face the company's current situation. "When people are busy and are just trying to get people to refund their money, I basically collapse when the problem is basically solved and I start counting the money in hand."
成立于2014年的皇包车旅行，在质疑和重重困难中走到现在，直到2019年2月份刚刚开始盈利。
Established in 2014, the royal chartered car travel, in doubt and difficulties to the present, until February 2019 just began to make a profit.
孟磊原本以为，2020年会是公司收获的一年。
Meng Lei originally thought, 2020 will be the year that the company harvests.
那天半夜，35岁的孟磊跪在山东老家地上，回顾从20岁开始创业的这些年，感到五味杂陈，委屈又心力交瘁地哽咽了很久。
In the middle of the night, Meng Lei, 35, knelt on the ground in his native Shandong province and recalled the years he had spent starting a business at the age of 20.
1月28日，他坐上了回北京的高铁，想着“无论如何还是得扛下去，能扛一天是一天。
On January 28th, he got on the high-speed train back to Beijing, thinking, "It's a day to carry it anyway.
”虽然还未看到能够解决问题的“那条缝”，但他依然努力在找寻各种解决办法。
"He hasn't seen the" crack "that will solve the problem, but he's still trying to find solutions.
“疫情会阶段性地影响行业，但不会摧毁行业，因为需求还在、痛点还在、机会还在。
"The epidemic will affect the industry in stages, but it will not destroy it because demand is there, the pain is there, the opportunity is there."
现在能做的就是养精蓄锐、练好内功，等着迎接疫后全民旅行的‘报复性’反弹机会。
Now can do is to save energy, practice good internal work, waiting to meet the epidemic after the national travel 'retaliatory' rebound opportunity.
”孟磊说。
