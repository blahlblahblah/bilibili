记者/颜星悦实习记者/陈威敬编辑/计巍宋建华志愿者通过无接触方式给患者配送制氧机这是一个每日在线咨询约200人次，由50多个微信群组成的“问诊”新冠肺炎的“线上医院”。
Reporter / Yan Xingyue Intern / Chen Weijing Editors / Jianhua Chen Volunteers Distribute Oxygen Generator to Patients through No Contact This is an online consultation service of about 200 people a day, and more than 50 micro-groups of micro-groups to consult the "online hospital" of new crown pneumonia.
它并不是真正的医院，更贴切地说，它是一种支援。
It is not really a hospital; rather, it is a form of support.
NCP（新冠）生命支援团队（以下简称NCP生命支援）由一群医生及公益人自愿发起，通过网络招募具备临床执业资格、社工和心理学背景的志愿者加入，以网络协作的形式，为新冠肺炎患者及家属提供身心健康恢复支持。
The NCP (New Crown) Life Support Team (NCP Life Support) is a voluntary initiative of a group of doctors and community volunteers. Volunteers with clinical qualifications, social workers and psychological background are recruited to provide physical and mental health rehabilitation support to patients and their families in the form of network collaboration.
目前已有600多人加入。
More than 600 people have now joined.
“线上医疗救援其实是很有限制的。
"Online medical aid is actually very limited.
”这是NCP生命支援的发起人郝南和团队中的志愿者都十分清楚的一点。
This is one thing that both Hao Nan, the founder of NCP Life Support, and the volunteers on the team know well.
他们要在这个基础上开展救援。
They are going to help on this basis.
眼下，NCP生命支援正在想办法将募集到的一批制氧机送到武汉和湖北等地的医疗点和患者家中。
At present, NCP life support is looking for ways to send a batch of collected oxygen machines to medical stations and patients' homes in Wuhan and Hubei.
对于无法入院的处于缺氧状态的新冠肺炎患者而言，氧气意味着生的希望。
For those who cannot be admitted to hospital in the hypoxic condition of new crown pneumonia, oxygen means the hope of life.
但由于缺少司机，配送困难，目前仍有数百台制氧机无法送出。
But there are still hundreds of oxygen machines that cannot be delivered because of lack of drivers and distribution difficulties.
NCP生命支援发起者郝南“有限”的救助，能帮一个是一个“1月22号有报道出现无症状的感染者，网络上渐渐地涌出很多住不进医院的帖子，医疗资源紧张到极点。
NCP Life Support sponsor Hao Nan "limited" help one is "January 22 there are reports of asymptomatic infected people, the network gradually gush out of a lot of hospital posts, medical resources are extremely tight.
”曾经的从医经历，以及从事民间救援近十年的经验，使郝南察觉到这次疫情的严重。
Hao Nan sensed the severity of the outbreak, thanks to his medical experience and nearly a decade of experience in private rescue.
大年三十晚上，他在微博上发布了NCP生命支援的招募贴：“我们是一群自发汇集、希望支援武汉及周边可能罹患新型冠状病毒肺炎的患者及家属的网络志愿者。
On the eve of the Lunar New Year, he posted a recruitment poster for NCP life support on Weibo: "We are a group of network volunteers who have come together spontaneously to support patients and their families in Wuhan and surrounding areas who are at risk of contracting the new coronavirus pneumonia.
现在我们正在搜集无法获得足够医疗支持的患者求助，并试图与ta们取得联系，支持ta们居家自助互助，对接合适的医疗资源……”一天之内，郝南收到了2000多份报名表，其中有医学背景的报名者200个。
Now we are collecting help from patients who cannot get enough medical support and trying to reach out to the ta people to help themselves at home and dock the right medical resources... "Within a day Hao received more than 2,000 applications, including 200 applicants with a medical background.
经过初步筛选，25名具有临床经验的医生成为NCP生命支援最初的志愿者。
After initial screening, 25 clinically experienced doctors became the original NCP volunteers for life support.
北京民航总医院急诊科医生阿力也在当天加入NCP生命支援，成为团队中的“协调者”，“我是一个急诊科医生，我想去帮着解答一点问题，能帮一个是一个。
On the same day, Li, an emergency doctor at the General Civil Aviation Hospital in Beijing, joined NCP Life Support as the "coordinator" of the team. "I'm an emergency doctor and I want to help with a few questions.
”目前，NCP生命支援每日在线咨询约200人次。
NCP currently receives about 200 online consultations a day.
在接触患者的过程中，他们发现，情况比想象中的要严重。
In the course of their contact with the patients, they found that the situation was more serious than expected.
进入这间“线上医院”的患者依照病情的轻重，被安排在不同的病患群里。
Patients admitted to the online hospital are placed in different groups, depending on the severity of the illness.
对于轻症患者，他们采取两方面救助，一方面是医疗咨询，医生阿力会要求患者把自己的CT结果、体温、血氧等数据报告在群里，“ 但线上医疗救援其实是很有限制的，药方我们是不能够开的，我们不是患者的主治医生。
For people with mild cases, there are two types of assistance: medical consultation, and doctors like Alexander will ask patients to report their CT results, body temperature, blood oxygen and so on. But online medical assistance is very limited, we can not prescribe medicine, we are not the patient's doctor.
再一来，患者跟我们反映说现在根本买不到药，或者买到了也没人配送。
Again, the patient tells us that no medicine is available, or that no one buys it and no one distributes it.
我们主要是根据患者现有的一些基础的药物来做判断，吃哪一种或者哪几种来缓解并发症。
We rely mainly on some of the basic drugs available to the patient to determine which or which to take to alleviate the complications.
”另一方面是缓解焦虑，有一些患者CT显示肺部发炎症状并不严重，血检化验也正常，主要症状是咳嗽，“有些其实可能只是普通的肺炎或者感冒患者，但是身处武汉，这时候他们的心理很焦虑。
On the other hand, anxiety is alleviated. In some patients CT shows that the symptoms of inflammation are not serious, blood tests are normal and the main symptom is coughing.
我们跟踪他们的病情，比如说有患者发烧37度6，这时候他说要不要去医院？我就建议先睡一觉，第二天可能就好了。
We followed their condition, like a patient with a fever of 37 degrees 6, when he said he wanted to go to the hospital? I suggested sleeping first, maybe the next day.
比如有时候来咨询的人说他喘不上气儿，这时候我再问他，你在玩手机的时候能喘上气不？他想一想就说好像是可以的。
For example, when a counselor says he's out of breath, I ask him again, Can you gasp while you're playing on the phone? He thinks about it as if it's OK.
”“方舱医院”投入使用后，轻症患者问询的数量减少了三分之一。
The number of enquiries from patients with mild illness has fallen by a third since the introduction of the Fang Cathedral Hospital.
由于方舱医院和酒店隔离点的医护力量紧缺，仍会有患者会向阿力报告自己的身体情况，询问办法。
Due to the shortage of medical care at the Fang Causeway Hospital and Hotel Isolation Point, there will still be patients who will report their condition to Alexander and ask for advice.
“重症患者的需求只有一个，就是住院。
"There's only one need for a serious patient: hospitalization.
”郝南说。
"said Hao.
很多重症患者在有机会住院前经历着漫长的等待。
Many seriously ill patients experience long waits before they have the opportunity to be hospitalized.
对于每一个进入“线上医院”的重症患者，NCP生命支援需要至少三个志愿者同时参与救助。
For every critically ill patient admitted to an online hospital, NCP life support requires at least three volunteers to participate.
首先，需要一个医生志愿者时刻联系着重症患者的亲属，冷静地帮助患者思考，指导亲属们怎样保持患者的意识和生命体征。
First, a volunteer doctor is needed to keep in touch with relatives of critically ill patients, to help them think calmly, and to guide them on how to maintain their patients' awareness and vital signs.
“有一个重症患者的女儿在街上买药，但是她不知道在哪里买，在街上碰运气，这时候我告诉她：你必须要回家陪在患者身边，买药这种事可以交给亲戚朋友。
"A daughter of a seriously ill patient was buying medicine on the street, but she didn't know where to buy it and she took a chance on the street when I told her: You have to go home with the patient.
等她回去一看，老人已经自我放弃，连氧气管都拔了。
When she went back, the old man had given up and had even pulled out the oxygen tube.
要再晚回去一点的话，就救不了了。
If you go back a little later, you won't be able to save yourself.
”郝南说。
"said Hao.
在医生指导家属照护重症患者的同时，NCP生命支援还会派出一个志愿者帮重症患者联系社区，经验丰富的志愿者比病患家属更清楚武汉市卫健委的社区网格操作。
NCP life support also sends a volunteer to help the seriously ill connect with the community. Experienced volunteers know better than the patient's family about the community grid operation of the Wuhan Health Commission.
志愿者通过患者的地址判断其所在的小区，在里边找到社区的人，再找到社区医院的联系方式。
Volunteers use the address of the patient to judge their community, find people inside the community, and then find the contact information of the community hospital.
此外，还需要一个志愿者同步帮助拨打120，“120是很难打通的，这时候需要反复打。
In addition, a volunteer was needed to synchronize the calls to 120, "120 is hard to get through and you need to hit it again and again.
” 有时候患者打通了120，也不知道怎样表达症状和需求，这时候志愿者告诉家属们应该怎样有效率地沟通，避免错失机会。
Sometimes the patient has 120 calls and doesn't know how to express symptoms and needs, when volunteers tell family members how to communicate efficiently and avoid missed opportunities.
NCP生命支援采用网络协作的形式进行志愿服务一边安抚情绪，一边判断谁更着急阿力认为，人手不够是目前NCP生命支援的最大难题。
NCP Life Support uses networking as a form of volunteering to soothe the emotions and to judge who is more anxious. Alexander believes that lack of staff is the biggest problem with NCP life support.
呼吸科的医生格外短缺。
There is an exceptional shortage of respiratory doctors.
在阿力协调管理的十八个病患群中，“重症群”有四五个，其中的患者大多数都存在呼吸系统上的症状，按照医患数量配比，每个群里至少得有5个呼吸科医生。
Of the eighteen patients in the group, most had respiratory symptoms and had to have at least five respiratory doctors in each group, proportional to the number of patients.
但是团队里一共只有16个呼吸科医生，甚至每个群一个都难以满足。
But there were only 16 respirators on the team, and not even one in each group could be satisfied.
“人员最紧张的时候，有个群里面只有我们两个大夫，要面对接近50个患者的咨询，忙不过来，我们只有一边安抚情绪，一边来判断谁更着急，然后优先去回答病情最重的患者。
"At our most stressful time, there was a group of two doctors who had to deal with close to 50 patients, so we had to calm down and decide who was more anxious and give priority to the most ill.
”阿力说。
"said Alexandra.
团队里的医生都是一线工作者，一些主任、副主任医师，本身有很重的工作任务，只能利用有限的休息时间来服务，阿力一直在思考怎么能让更多的医生加入进来，“因为患者的数据现在越来越多，压力特别大。
The team of doctors are front-line workers, some directors, deputy chief physicians, themselves have a very heavy task, can only use limited rest time to serve, Alexander has been thinking about how to involve more doctors, "because the number of patients is now increasing, the pressure is particularly high.
”在阿力看来，心理医生是NCP生命支援的另一个大缺口，“我们联系一些患者的时候，发现他是绝望的，他会跟我们哭诉20多分钟，我们试图给他提供帮助的时候，他的态度很消极，说没用了，什么都晚了。
According to Ali, the psychiatrist was another big gap in NCP life support. "When we contacted some patients, we found him desperate, and he would cry to us for more than 20 minutes.
”面对这种有心理创伤的患者，阿力觉得很无力，一个急诊科大夫看得懂CT，读得懂数据，却说不出安慰的话。
"Confronted with the trauma, Ali felt powerless, and an emergency doctor could read the CT, read the data, but could not say consolation.
“我们很希望有专业的心理团队去支援他们，武汉人民甚至湖北人民心灵的创伤是很严重的。
"We would like to have a professional psychological team to support them, Wuhan people and even the people of Hubei trauma is very serious.
”阿力说。
"said Alexandra.
阿力的一天都在围着“网络医院”中的患者转，一台电脑，一部手机，频繁地切换于各个患者群。
A day of A Li all around "network hospital" patient transfers, a computer, a mobile phone, frequently switch to each patient group.
“1月31号我回到北京，要隔离一周，我就被隔离在我们医院的病房里，这段时间我全力投入于志愿者的服务中。
"When I returned to Beijing on January 31 for a week of isolation, I was isolated in our hospital ward, and I devoted myself to volunteer work.
”群里的患者数目每日以百为单位增长，从2月3日开始，阿力忙到一天只吃一顿饭。
The number of patients in the group grew in hundreds a day, and from February 3 onwards, Ali was busy eating only one meal a day.
早上8点，阿力醒来后会喝一袋牛奶，便开始给志愿者们分配任务，然后把新加入群的患者进行“分诊”，放入不同的病患群。
At 8 a.m., when he wakes up with a bag of milk, he assigns tasks to the volunteers and then "splits" the newly admitted patients into different groups.
中午饭过后，他全力投入到患者的病情中，并协调物资组的资源，尽量帮病患解决问题。
After lunch, he threw himself into the patient's condition and coordinated the supplies team's resources to help the patient solve his problems as much as possible.
送达患者的第一台制氧机，正在为一名老人辅助供氧帮患者打通120，是今天最温暖的事忙碌的日常中，还有一群“小天使”在支持着阿力和NCP生命支援团队。
The first oxygen machine reaching the patient is opening 120 for an elderly paramedic, the warmest day of the day, and a group of "angels" supporting the life support teams of Alexander and NCP.
“我特别想感谢一些大四大五的医学生，他们来自全国各地，加入到我们群体里，每天在网上寻找需要帮助的病患，然后打电话过去问询。
"I particularly want to thank the Big Four and Five medical students who come from all over the country and join our community, looking online every day for people in need and then calling for help.
”阿力说。
"said Alexandra.
阿力管这些医学生叫做“小天使”，由于没有临床经验，“小天使”们不能参加到医疗帮助，但却是患者在求助过程中接触到的第一个人。
He called the medical students "little angels," who had no clinical experience and could not participate in medical help, but were the first people they came in contact with.
“小天使”联系上病患之后，记录下患者报上来的呼吸、心跳、血氧、血压和体温数据，根据自己在学校学到的专业知识，做初步的判断，并将整理出的“病例”转交给群里专业的医生。
After contacting the patient, the angel records the breathing, heartbeat, blood oxygen, blood pressure and body temperature data reported by the patient, makes a preliminary judgement based on the professional knowledge he has acquired in school, and forwards the compiled "cases" to a specialist in the group.
“但是有一些患者在他们打电话过去的时候就已经去世了，这些都是二十出头的姑娘小伙，很多都是第一次面对生死，压力也特别的大。
"But some of the patients died in their early twenties, many of them for the first time in life and death, and were particularly stressed out.
”阿力说。
"said Alexandra.
像这样的“小天使”共有近100个，这个数据是不稳定的，有些学生工作了几天，承受不住来自患者的压力，就会选择离开。
There are nearly 100 such "angels," and the numbers are erratic, with some students working for a few days, unable to withstand the pressure from their patients and choosing to leave.
有“小天使”告诉阿力，“好像我学了医也没办法帮到他们很多。
"There was an angel who told him," It looks like I can't help them a lot if I'm a doctor.
”为了不让“小天使”们失去对医学的热情，阿力医生每天睡前会让“小天使”们汇报一下：今天有没有什么让你感到温暖的事情？“ 今天得到确诊的病人比昨天多了！”“ 我打了五个电话，其中三个患者现在已经住进医院了。
To keep the angelic child from losing his enthusiasm for medicine, Dr Ariel would ask the little angels to report before going to bed every night if anything warms you todayMore patients were diagnosed today than yesterday! I made five phone calls, and three of them are in hospital now.
”“ 今天帮助一个患者打通了120！”阿力医生觉得，只要大家在一起打打气，总能坚持下去。
"" That helped one patient through 120! "Dr Ally felt that as long as everyone cheered up together, they would stick to it.
在“无接触”送达供氧机时，志愿者远远地隔着口罩大声喊：你要坚强，会好起来的“你能帮帮他吗？”有个名叫“婷”的20岁左右的姑娘，让阿力印象深刻。
"No contact" when the oxygen supply machine, the volunteers from a distance across the mask shouted: you will be strong, will be well "Can you help him?" There is a name "Ting" about 20-year-old girl, Ai Li was impressed.
2月2日早上10点，阿力在微博上看到婷的求助信息：奶奶的病情很不好，还没有住院。
February 2 at 10 a.m., A Li saw Ting's help message on Weibo: Grandma is very ill, has not been hospitalized.
阿力私信问她：需不需要帮助？婷当时回复“需要”，并加了阿力的微信。
A private letter asked her: Do you need help? Ting then responded to "need", and added a letter from Ah Li.
婷对阿力说：“本以为都是假的，我通过好多渠道发了求助信息，您是第一位与我有联系的，非常感谢！”当天下午4点，婷再次联系阿力，但奶奶已经走了。
Ting said to Ah Li: "I thought that are false, I sent through many channels for help information, you are the first contact with me, thank you!" That day at 4: 00 p.m., Ting contacted Ah Li again, but Grandma has left.
她向阿力哭诉，遗体很快就要被拉到殡仪馆，立刻火化，不能够送葬，骨灰也要等到疫情全部结束后才能去处理。
She cried to Ali, the body will soon be pulled to the funeral home, immediately cremated, can not be buried, ashes will not be until the end of the epidemic.
阿力安慰她：“ 发生了这么多事，你如果愿意，可以用文字记录下来，不管是悲伤还是无助，这有助于你平复心情。
"After all that has happened, you can write it down in words if you like, whether it's sadness or helplessness.
” 婷听了之后，紧接着问阿力：“ 我能不能去加入志愿者？希望不要有更多的家庭像我们这样。
Ting listened to that, and then asked A Li: "Can I join the volunteers? I hope there are no more families like us.
”虽然婷不符合志愿者的招聘要求，没有加入到组织中，但是当她每次看到网上有人求助，就会把信息转发给阿力，说“你能帮帮他吗？”受到过帮助的患者经常会把新患者拉进NCP生命支援群，郝南介绍，NCP生命支援已经形成8个部门，是一个有“一线门诊”、“二线病房”、“三线监护室”等50多个微信群组成的“线上医院”。
Although Ting did not meet the recruitment requirements of volunteers, she did not join the organization, but every time she saw someone on the Internet asking for help, she would forward the message to Ah Lee, saying: "Can you help him?
NCP生命支援制作的无接触发放流程制氧机的最后一公里除了线上医疗咨询服务，NCP生命支持团队还在为患者们寻找医疗物资。
The last kilometer of the NCP life-support process oxygen generator, in addition to online medical counselling, NCP life support teams are looking for medical supplies for patients.
截止2月11日13:00，NCP生命支援通过公益渠道募集了1945台制氧机，其中1292台已经发往医疗点，56台发给了患者家属。
As at 1300 hours on 11 February, NCP Life Support had collected 1945 oxygen machines through public service channels, of which 1,292 had been delivered to medical sites and 56 to the families of patients.
有需求的患者们只需要在网上填写表格，通过医生的审核之后，便可以申请制氧机配送到家的服务。
Patients in need can simply fill out the form online, pass a doctor's review, and apply for a home delivery service on an oxygen machine.
“目前制氧机是充足的，困难在于配送。
"Oxygen generators are plentiful at the moment, and the difficulty is distribution.
我们本来是打算让社区帮忙转交，但社区工作也近乎饱和，所以只有我们自己找车队配送了。
We were going to ask the community to help with the transfer, but the community work was almost saturated, so we had to find our own distribution team.
” 郝南说。
"said Hao.
考虑到已经有志愿者感染的先例，执行团队希望尽量减少患者、家属、志愿者司机碰面的机会，他研究出一个“无接触派送方法”：1、装载着制氧机的车辆到达患者小区，拨通患者电话，并将制氧机放在地面上，距离25米等待患者下楼收货。
The executive team, hoping to minimize opportunities for patients, families and volunteer drivers to meet, developed a "no-contact delivery system": 1. An oxygen-making vehicle arrives in the patient's area, dials the patient's phone and places the oxygen machine on the ground, 25 metres away, waiting for the patient to come downstairs for delivery.
2、患者到达小区门口，举着接收单，挥一挥手向司机示意。
2. The patient arrives at the gate of the community, raises the receiving list and waves to the driver.
3、司机拍摄患者举着接收单的照片，表示患者配送完成。
The driver took a picture of the patient with a receipt, indicating that the delivery was complete.
尽管有这样谨慎的派送方法，由于要前往重症患者的小区，愿意参与配送的司机很有限，这是摆在郝南面前的一大难题，“我真的尽了最大的努力，在本地的志愿者网络里发动人去找，我都找了个遍，也不断地跟司机重复我们的派送方法，目前只有民间救援队的三五个司机在帮忙，所以一天只能发出不到20个。
Despite this cautious approach to dispatching, the limited number of drivers willing to participate in the distribution due to travel to the seriously ill community was a major problem for Hao Nan. "I really tried my best to get people to look for us in our local volunteer network and kept repeating our dispatch method to the drivers.
”NCP生命支援在“售后服务”上会继续对接患者。
NCP Life Support will continue to docking patients in "after-sales service."
在患者接收到制氧机之后，一个“小天使”志愿者会在线上一对一地指导患者或者家属怎么去使用机器，并交待使用过程以及消毒的注意事项。
After the patient received the oxygen machine, a "little angel" volunteer worked one-on-one online to instruct the patient or family on how to use the machine and explain the process and precautions for disinfection.
这些制氧机给仍在家中的患者带来了希望，“我们有一个患者前天晚上的氧气用完了，如果昨天制氧机没到的话，昨晚可能就很难熬过去了，现在他用了两天，已经能自己下地看电视了。
"One of our patients ran out of oxygen the night before yesterday, and if the oxygen machine hadn't arrived yesterday, it would have been hard to last night.
”郝南说。
"said Hao.
由于配送困难，仍有几台制氧机没能派出，NCP生命支援希望借助深一度平台招募一些湖北境内的司机，以下是联系方式。
Due to distribution difficulties, several oxygen machines still could not be dispatched. NCP Life Support hopes to recruit some drivers in Hubei with the help of deep platform. The following is the contact information.
