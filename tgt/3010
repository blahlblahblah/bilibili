澎湃新闻记者 王俊澎湃首席评论员 西坡3月5日晚间的央视新闻联播和新华社都共同关注了一个问题。
Wang Jun Pai, the leading commentator Wang Ju Peng, a leading commentator on the evening of March 5, CCTV News and Xinhua News Agency both shared a common concern.
什么问题呢？无他——武汉社区疫情防控和群众生活保障情况。
What problem? No other - Wuhan community epidemic prevention and control and public living security situation.
中央指导组进社区新华社3月5日晚间从武汉发回的电稿称，社区是疫情防控的第一线。
The central steering group into the community Xinhua news agency on the night of March 5 from Wuhan telegram said that the community is the first line of prevention and control of the epidemic.
为深入贯彻习近平总书记重要指示精神，落实中央应对疫情工作领导小组部署，5日上午，中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理孙春兰率中央指导组到武汉市青山区翠园社区、江汉区西桥社区，实地察看社区防控和群众生活保障情况。
On the morning of May 5, a member of the Political Bureau and Vice Premier of the State Council, Sun Chunlan, led the Central Steering Group to the Qingshan and Xiqiao communities in Qingshan District, Wuhan City, to observe community control and ensure people's livelihood.
孙春兰仔细询问社区防控的具体措施，了解社区干部、网格员、下沉干部、志愿者等的工作情况。
Sun Chunlan carefully asked the concrete measures of community prevention and control, understand the work of community cadres, grid workers, sinking cadres, volunteers, etc.
她强调，湖北和武汉疫情防控任务依然艰巨繁重，必须持之以恒抓好社区防控工作，坚决守严守牢疫情联防联控、群防群控的社区防线。
She stressed that the task of prevention and control of the epidemic in Hubei and Wuhan was still arduous, and that it was necessary to persevere in the prevention and control of the community and to firmly adhere to the joint epidemic prevention and control, crowd-controlled community defense line.
孙春兰详细了解生鲜蔬菜、婴幼儿用品、慢性病药品等供应情况，要求千方百计做好生活物资服务保障工作，尽可能丰富品种，优化配送方式，加强对残疾人、孤寡老人等特殊困难群体的帮扶。
Sun Chunlan knows in detail the supply of raw vegetables, infant and toddler's articles, and medicines for chronic diseases, and demands that every effort be made to ensure the best possible variety of goods and services, optimize the mode of distribution and strengthen assistance to the disabled, the elderly and other special difficulties.
报道称，针对群众现场反映的困难和问题，孙春兰立即要求省、市领导深入调查，不回避矛盾，杜绝形式主义、官僚主义，要坚持务实作风，实事求是、切实解决问题，提升群众满意度。
Responding to the difficulties and problems reported by the masses on the spot, Sun Chunlan immediately asked provincial and municipal leaders to conduct in-depth investigations, avoid contradictions, put an end to formalism and bureaucracy, adhere to a pragmatic style, seek truth from facts and solve problems in a practical way, and enhance the public's satisfaction.
3月5日晚间，央视新闻联播也报道了中央指导组的这一消息。
On the night of March 5, CCTV News Network also reported the news from the Central Steering Group.
群众反映了什么问题？事实上，这条重要消息里的一句话“群众现场反映的困难和问题”信息量很大。
What are the problems the masses have in mind? In fact, one sentence in this important news item, "Difficulties and problems reported by the masses on the spot," is very informative.
3月5日晚9时半，微信公众号“陶然笔记”发布文章《掩饰矛盾解决不了百姓生活保障问题》作了更为详细的披露。
March 5 evening 9: 30, Weixin public "Tao Ran Notebook" published the article "Concealing contradictions can not solve the problem of people living security" made a more detailed disclosure.
根据陶然笔记的文章，从3月5日中午开始，关于中央指导组在武汉小区考察的帖子在网上流传开来，有文字也有视频。
According to Tao Ran's notes, from noon on March 5, posts on the central guidance group's study in Wuhan district spread around the Internet, with both text and video.
帖子里说，3月5日早上，中央指导组在武汉市青山区翠园社区开元公馆小区考察时，有居民从家里的窗户向正在考察的中央指导组喊，“假的，假的”，主要反映的是社区物业假装让志愿者送菜送肉给业主，实际工作不到位的情况。
On the morning of March 5, while visiting the neighborhood of the Kaiyuan Commune in Qingshan District of Wuhan City, residents shouted to the Central Steering Group under investigation from their windows, "False, fake," mainly reflecting the fact that the community property pretended to let volunteers deliver meat to the owners.
上述文章称，据陶然笔记了解，帖子里关于现场的内容基本属实。
According to the above article, according to Tao Ran notes, posts about the scene of the content is basically true.
文章透露，孙春兰副总理当即要求省市领导深入了解情况并指出，群众有情绪很正常，这提醒我们，社区群众的基本生活保障还存在短板。
The article revealed that Vice Premier Sun Chunlan immediately asked provincial and municipal leaders to deepen their understanding of the situation and pointed out that people are in a normal mood, which reminds us that there are still shortcomings in the basic livelihood security of the community.
不要掩饰矛盾，要实事求是，明确问题出在哪里，及时解决问题、化解矛盾，绝不能搞形式主义、官僚主义。
We should not conceal contradictions, seek truth from facts, find out where the problem lies, solve the problem in time, eliminate contradictions, and never engage in formalism or bureaucracy.
中央指导组又是怎么解决的？陶然笔记在上述文章中指出，大约4个小时以后，中央指导组召集省、市有关负责同志召开专题会议。
About four hours later, the Central Steering Group convened a meeting of leading comrades from the provinces and municipalities concerned, Tao Ran noted.
研究进一步做好群众生活保障工作，强调要打通生活物资供应和社区服务的“最后一公里”，做好社区群众的心理疏导工作，让他们居家生活更加安心。
We will do a better job of ensuring people's livelihood, stressing the importance of opening up the "last kilometer" in the supply of materials and community services, and doing a good job of psychological guidance for the community so as to make their lives at home more secure.
武汉市已经派人对社区的3000多户居民逐一上门，入户调查，了解具体诉求后着手解决。
Wuhan city has sent personnel to the community of more than 3,000 households door-to-door, door-to-door investigation, understand specific claims and then proceed to solve.
而新华社上述电稿最后也提到：“下午，中央指导组召开专题会议，研究进一步做好群众生活保障工作，强调要打通生活物资供应和社区服务的‘最后一公里’，做好社区群众的心理疏导工作，让他们居家生活更加安心。
"In the afternoon, the Central Steering Group held a special meeting to study how to further guarantee people's livelihood, emphasize the importance of" the last kilometer "in providing daily necessities and community services, and do a good job of psychological guidance and reassuring people living at home.
”马上评假的就是假的，真实的声音最有力什么叫形式主义、官僚主义，如何破除形式主义、官僚主义，3月5日的《新闻联播》进行了最好的阐释。
What is the most powerful thing is formalism and bureaucracy, and how to break down formalism and bureaucracy, as best illustrated in the March 5 issue of the News Network.
报道中有一段话：“针对群众现场反映的困难和问题，孙春兰立即要求省、市领导深入调查，不回避矛盾，杜绝形式主义、官僚主义，要坚持务实作风，实事求是、切实解决问题，提升群众满意度。
"Aiming at the difficulties and problems reported by the masses on the spot, Sun Chunlan immediately asked the provincial and municipal leaders to conduct in-depth investigations, avoid contradictions, put an end to formalism and bureaucracy, adhere to a pragmatic style, seek truth from facts and solve problems in a practical way, and enhance the people's satisfaction
”这是一次非常有意义的民意表达与对民意的回应。
This is a very meaningful expression of public opinion and a response to it.
中央指导组去一线调查，就是为了了解真实情况，解决真实问题。
The Central Steering Group went to the frontline investigation to find out the real situation and solve the real problems.
弄虚作假既是糊弄市民，又是对指导组工作的干扰，幸好有那声发自本能的嘹亮呼喊，让一切都穿帮了。
False fraud is not only to fool the public, but also to the work of the steering group of interference, fortunately from the sound of a clear and instinctive cry, let everything through to help.
通过网帖只能了解故事的一半，也就是市民如何发声，《新闻联播》将故事的另一半补全了。
Only half of the story, that is, how the public voice, the newscast will be the other half of the story to complete.
现在我们知道，群众“现场”反映的困难和问题，“立即”就被听到，迅速得到系统性解决。
We now know that the difficulties and problems reported by the masses "on the spot" are heard "immediately" and are promptly and systematically solved.
据陶然笔记微信公号，大约4个小时后，中央指导组召集省、市有关负责同志召开专题会议，研究进一步做好群众生活保障工作，强调要打通生活物资供应和社区服务的“最后一公里”，做好社区群众的心理疏导工作，让他们居家生活更加安心。
About four hours later, the Central Steering Group called relevant leading comrades from the provinces and municipalities to hold special meetings to study how to further guarantee people's lives, emphasize the need to open the "last kilometer" for the supply of living materials and community services, and do a good job of psychological guidance for the community so that they can live in peace and contentment.
这才是对待民意的正确方式。
That is the right way to approach public opinion.
从楼上大喊，无疑是非典型的民意表达，但它贵在真实。
Shouting from upstairs is no doubt an atypical expression of public opinion, but it is expensive in reality.
事实证明，真实的声音才是最有力的，才是决策最需要的参考。
In fact, the real voice is the most powerful, is the most needed decision-making reference.
关于武汉市民该不该抱怨生活中遇到的困难，一直有些争议，有人说大家都不容易，应该互相体谅。
About Wuhan city people should complain about the difficulties encountered in life, there has been some controversy, some people say that we are not easy, should understand each other.
但是只有让民意充分表达，才能知道哪些问题是需要优先解决的。
But only by allowing public opinion to be fully expressed can we know which issues need to be addressed as a matter of priority.
也只有各方将诉求、苦衷、能力边界互相交个实底，才能实现团结。
Unity can be achieved only if the parties concerned cross the boundaries of their claims, grievances and capabilities.
让矛盾暴露出来，解决问题的途径也就会显现出来。
Let the contradiction come to light, and the way to solve the problem will emerge.
疫情是一面镜子，把所有人、所有事照得清清楚楚，真的假不了，假的真不了。
The epidemic is a mirror, all the people, all the things clearly, true can't be false, not true.
从疫情开始到现在，从武汉、湖北到全国，每个环节每个岗位做得如何，公众心中一直有数。
From the beginning of the epidemic to the present, from Wuhan, Hubei to the whole country, every link of how well each post, the public mind has been known.
对于那些牺牲奉献者，人们从来不吝于褒奖，对于那些作假添乱者，人们则会径直戳穿、大张挞伐。
For those who sacrifice devotees, people never hesitate to praise, but for those who make mistakes, people take some apparent telltale signs.
归根结底，只需要回到“实事求是”这四个大字上来。
In the final analysis, it is only a matter of returning to the four big words "seeking truth from facts."
