公卫专家：1月5日提交正式报告，直报系统有需改进地方。
Public health experts: The official report was submitted on 5 January, and there is room for improvement in the direct reporting system.

我们上海公共卫生中心在1月5日提交正式的报告，从我们公共卫生的角度，我们的科学家、我们的管理者，做出了我们该做的事情。
We at the Shanghai Public Health Center presented our official report on January 5, and from our public health point of view, our scientists, our managers, did what we had to do.
。
.
上海收治第一例新冠肺炎患者的1月20日，卢洪洲教授就拖着行李箱住进了医院。
When Shanghai admitted its first case of pneumonia on January 20, Professor Luhong Zhou dragged his suitcase to the hospital.
一个多月以来，他一共回家两次，都是趁着到市区开会的机会，回家拿换洗衣服。
For more than a month he had been home twice, taking advantage of meetings downtown to get his clothes changed.
卢洪洲是全国新冠肺炎医疗救治专家组成员，也是复旦大学附属上海市公共卫生临床中心（以下简称：上海公共卫生中心）党委书记。
Lu Hongzhou is a member of the National Expert Group on New Crown Pneumonia and Secretary of the Party Committee of Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center attached to Fudan University.
该中心是上海市收治新冠肺炎成人患者的定点医院，截至2月25日12时，上海累计确诊患者336人，268例治愈出院，死亡3人。
As of 12: 00 on February 25, 336 patients had been diagnosed in Shanghai, 268 cases had been cured and discharged, and 3 people had died.
卢洪洲介绍，上海是老龄化社会，感染者里面发病的老年人很多，大多是居家被感染的。
Lu Hongzhou, Shanghai is an aging society, infected with many elderly people within the home, most of the infected.
上海公共卫生中心还参与了早期武汉疫情防控，并紧急上报了相关报告。
The Shanghai Public Health Center also participated in the early prevention and control of the Wuhan epidemic, and reported on the emergency.
对于疫情拐点是否来临，他表示，“从临床的角度，我们不讲拐点，以疫情宣告结束为准。
"From a clinical point of view, we do not talk about the inflection point, to declare the end of the epidemic," he said.
”全国新冠肺炎医疗救治专家组成员、复旦大学附属上海市公共卫生临床中心党委书记卢洪洲。
Lu Hongzhou, a member of the National Group of Experts on New Crown Pneumonia and affiliated with Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University.
院感最关键在于管理新京报：目前上海公共卫生中心的患者临床表现与早期收治病人是否存在不同？有没有一些特殊病例？卢洪洲：临床表现没什么不同，没有发现病毒变异的证据。
Is there any difference between the clinical manifestation of patients and the early treatment of patients? Are there any special cases? LuHong Chau: There is no difference in clinical manifestation and no evidence of virus variation.
目前有一例危重症患者，上了呼吸机和插管，2月20日晚上开始使用血清治疗。
There is one case of critically ill patients who have been placed on a ventilator and intubation and began to use serum on the evening of February 20.
血清是由治愈出院的患者捐献。
Serums are donated by patients who are cured and discharged.
目前治疗效果还没那么快，按道理会有效果。
The current treatment effect is not so fast, according to the truth will have an effect.
新京报：成都出现过一个患者，出院10天之后复查核酸又呈阳性，像上海有这样的患者吗？痊愈出院的标准是什么？卢洪洲：上海目前没有这种患者。
The Beijing News: There was a patient in Chengdu, 10 days after discharge from the hospital to review nucleic acid positive. Is there such a patient in Shanghai? What are the criteria for recovery and discharge? Luhong zhou: There is no such patient in Shanghai.
出院标准也是按照国家诊疗方案里的标准，比如间隔24小时两次核酸检测显示阴性，无发热，肺部影像显示病灶较之前明显吸收，没有其他症状，需要综合考虑。
The discharge criteria are also in accordance with the criteria of the National Diagnostic Programme, such as negative nucleic acid testing at 24-hour intervals, no fever, lung imaging showing significant absorption of lesions compared to earlier ones, no other symptoms and comprehensive consideration.
已经康复的患者是不可能复发的，因为产生抗体了，不可能再感染了。
Patients who have recovered are unlikely to relapse, as antibodies are produced and it is impossible to reinfect.
只要病毒没有变，就不存在再次感染的可能性。
As long as the virus does not change, there is no possibility of reinfection.
成都的那位患者我相信他也是按照标准两次核酸转阴才出院的。
The patient in Chengdu, I believe, was discharged only after two rounds of nucleic acid overcast.
但每个人代谢病毒的时间有长有短，取样有时候能取到阳性标准，有时候取不到，有可能正好他没被取到阳性标本。
However, the time taken to metabolize the virus varies from person to person. Sampling can sometimes be positive, sometimes it is not, and it may happen that he has not been tested positive.
还有一种可能是，患者康复以后，体内产生病毒抗体。
Another possibility is that the patient recovers, the body produces antibodies to the virus.
这个病毒死掉了，随着细胞代谢排出来，刚好这时候做核酸检测查到了阳性，但它其实不是一个活病毒，是代谢的一个产物。
The virus died and was tested positive for nucleic acid just as the cell's metabolism drained out, but it was not a live virus and was a product of metabolism.
新京报：有一些信息里面提到医院有出院率的压力？怎么看这个问题？卢洪洲：谈出院率完全没有任何价值。
Beijing News: There is some information about the pressure on hospitals to discharge from the hospital? How do you feel about that? Luhong zhou: Talking about discharge rates is completely worthless.
早收治，病人就早痊愈。
Early treatment makes a full recovery.
我们现在就剩一些重症病人。
We have some serious cases left right now.
疫情早期病人没有出院，出院率就低，疫情中晚期了，病人陆续出院，出院率就高。
Early patients did not discharge from the hospital, the discharge rate is low, the disease is in the late stage, patients continue to leave hospital, discharge rate is high.
新京报：在上海，有没有慢性病患者在疫情当中受影响?卢洪洲：上海是老龄化社会，感染者里面发病的老年人很多，大多是居家被感染的。
The Beijing News: Is there a chronic disease in Shanghai affected by the epidemic? Luhong zhou: Shanghai is an aging society, infected with many elderly people, most of them infected at home.
有的是孩子在武汉工作，老人到武汉探亲，有的是老人从武汉到上海来探亲。
Some children work in Wuhan, old people visit Wuhan, some old people from Wuhan to Shanghai to visit family.
老年人脑梗、心梗、糖尿病、高血压、冠心病都有，所以治疗起来比较难，重症的老年人会上呼吸机、ECMO，在这方面有很多挑战。
Older people have cerebral infarction, myocardial infarction, diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, so treatment is more difficult, severe elderly people will ventilator, ECMO, there are many challenges in this regard.
ECMO对青少年、年龄越小的孩子，脏器功能越完善，它的成功率越高；对老年人，并发症越多，它的成功率越低。
ECMO For adolescents, the younger the child, the more successful the organ is; the more complications there are in the elderly, the lower their success rate.
以前SARS的时候没有ECMO，现在上ECMO的这些患者如果在当年可能早就没命了。
Previously SARS did not have ECMO, now on ECMO these patients might have died that year.
新京报：中国-世卫组织联合考察专家组称，全国共有476家医疗机构3387例医务人员感染新冠肺炎病例。
The Beijing News: According to the China-WHO Joint Inspection Panel, there are 3,387 new cases of pneumonia among medical personnel in 476 medical institutions nationwide.
上海公共卫生中心院感情况如何？你们是如何防控的？卢洪洲：目前没有一个医务人员被感染。
How do you feel about the Shanghai Public Health Center? How do you control it? Luhong zhou: Not a single medical worker has been infected.
我们有非常严格的院感措施，首先从硬件上，我们是负压病房，最大限度减少病毒在隔离病房里的存在。
We have very strict hospital measures, first of all from the hardware, we are negative pressure wards, to minimize the presence of the virus in the isolation ward.
医护人员的个人防护，戴有正压的呼吸头罩、护目镜、口罩，全副武装。
Personal protection of medical staff, wearing a positive pressure breathing hood, goggles, masks, fully armed.
院感最关键还是在于管理。
The key to the sense of courtyard is management.
我们严格执行个人防护的规定，在每一个病房专门设置院感的双组长负责制，护士长跟院感科的工作人员来管理，我们是靠前指挥、过程管理、细节监督。
We strictly enforce the rules of personal protection, in each ward set up a sense of dual team leaders in charge of the system, head nurses and staff of the hospital sensory departments to manage, we are relying on the former command, process management, details supervision.
尤其是在病房里面的操作，比如为患者插管、气切、吸痰等，必须严格执行防控标准。
Especially in the ward inside the operation, such as for patients intubation, gas cut, sputum, and so on, must strictly implement control standards.
光是脱隔离服这个环节，我们就专门有人监督，每一步的手消要达到20秒。
Just to get rid of the isolation clothing this link, we are specially supervised, each step of the hand to reach 20 seconds.
另外，每天早晨上班和下班离开的时候，对所有的工作人员，使用我们自己研发的喷雾，吸入消化道的干扰素作为预防。
In addition, every morning at work and on the way out of work, we use our own spray to inhale the digestive tract interferon as a precaution for all staff.
假如有少量的病毒吸进去，干扰素能抑制病毒，我们把它作为一个暴露前的预防。
If a small amount of the virus is inhaled, interferon can inhibit the virus, which we use as a preexposure prophylaxis.
我们还有P3生物安全实验室，可以做核酸扩增。
We also have a P3 biosafety laboratory that can amplify nucleic acids.
每三天都有一个环境采样，对污染区的病房包括地面、床头、把手，半污染区还有清洁区进行采样。
An environmental sample is taken every three days. Wards in contaminated areas include floors, bed heads, handles, semi-contaminated areas and clean areas.
所有医护人员也是每三天就有一次咽拭子采样。
All medical staff also took swabs every three days.
即便是在清洁区，每个人吃饭、开会、讨论的时候也必须要做好个人防护，不允许集中在一起吃饭，也不允许不戴口罩。
Even in the cleaning area, everyone must be protected during meals, meetings and discussions, not allowed to eat together, and not allowed to wear masks.
医护人员三班倒休息，单人单间房间且固定，最大程度减少在休息区有可能存在的交叉感染。
Three shifts of medical staff, single rooms and fixed, minimize the possibility of cross-infection in the rest area.
外院来援助的医护，有的是从综合医院来的，对院感防护没有概念，我们先做培训，穿脱严格督查。
Outside the hospital to help some of the medical care from the general hospital, there is no concept of hospital protection, we do training, wearing strict supervision.
上海公共卫生中心的医生在临床中心。
Doctors at Shanghai Public Health Center are in the clinical center.
“从临床角度，我们不讲拐点，以疫情宣告结束为准”新京报：这几天全国陆续有多地的监狱出现聚集性感染，还有没有哪些我们可能忽视掉的地方会出现这种情况？ 卢洪洲：一些工地，尤其是建筑工地，是容易被忽视的。
"From the clinical point of view, we do not talk about the inflection point, the end of the declaration of the epidemic." The Beijing News: Over the past few days, there have been a number of prisons around the country with concentrated infections, and is there anything else that we might neglect? Luk Hong Chau: Some sites, especially construction sites, are easily overlooked.
工人们本身可能培训不到位，个人防护用品也不到位，尤其有些不舍得用这些防护用品的。
Workers themselves may not have in place training and personal protective equipment is not in place, especially if some are reluctant to use it.
新京报：对于北京、上海这样的超大型城市，接下来的防控形式应该做到什么程度？卢洪洲：现在这个阶段偶尔会有一些地方有疫情冒出来，我们宁可严格一点，做得“过”一点。
The Beijing News: For mega-cities like Beijing and Shanghai, what should be the next form of prevention and control? Luhong zhou: There are occasional outbreaks at this stage.
否则时不时哪个地方来个暴发，不停地要拉警报，不停地反复，时间会拖得太长，影响整个国民经济。
Otherwise, from time to time, an outburst will occur somewhere, incessantly warning and repeatedly, which will drag on too long and affect the whole national economy.
新京报：大家都在讨论拐点，怎么定义拐点，以及你觉得拐点什么时候会出现?卢洪洲：从临床的角度，我们不讲拐点，以疫情宣告结束为准。
When do you think the inflection point will appear? Luk Hong Chau: From the clinical point of view, we will not talk about the inflection point.
世界卫生组织有一个标准：某一个国家或地区连续两个最长潜伏期没有新发病例，就完全解禁。
The World Health Organization has a standard: complete elimination occurs when there are no new cases in a country or area for two consecutive maximum latency periods.
比如我们上海地区，如果连续两个最长潜伏期都没有新发病例，就可以放开了，那个时候隔离、口罩就没必要了。
In our Shanghai region, for example, if there are no new cases during the two longest incubation periods, we can let go of them, and quarantine and masks are unnecessary.
新京报：有专家谈道，我们要做好长期和新型冠状病毒共处的准备，它可能会变成一个类似流感那样的病毒，你是否认可？卢洪洲：我不认为会这样。
The Beijing News: Some experts have said that we need to prepare for a long-term and new-style cohabitation of coronavirus, which could become a influenza-like virus.
流感的宿主范围是非常广的，包括人、禽及一些野生动物在内。
Influenza has a very wide range of hosts, including people, birds and some wildlife.
像甲型流感，即使我们把人的传染控制住了，但其他动物还可以把这个病毒传给人，所以甲流将与人类长期生存，而且以后还将伴随人类。
Like Influenza A, even if we manage human infections, other animals can pass the virus on to humans, so swine flu will live with humans for a long time to come and will follow later.
但新冠病毒毕竟不像流感那样全球广泛地存在。
But the new crown virus is not as widespread as the flu itself.
目前我们知道的新型冠状病毒的宿主就是人类，可能还有比如穿山甲之类的少数动物，虽然现在溯源还没有搞清楚，但已经明确家禽、家畜不会感染。
The new coronavirus is now known to be hosted by humans, and possibly a small number of animals such as pangolins. Although the origin of the coronavirus remains unknown, it has been determined that poultry and domestic animals will not be infected.
我们这次大范围地把病毒围追堵截，切断传染源以后，它就会没有了。
When we cut off the source of the virus on a large scale, it will be gone.
当然，如果源头没找到，以后可能还会跑出来。
Of course, if the source is not found, it may come back later.
但目前情况下，它不可能像流感一样长期伴随着我们人类、大范围每年传播，这是我个人的观点。
But at the moment, it is not likely to be with us as long as the flu, the spread of large-scale annual spread, this is my personal point of view.
新冠肺炎患者从上海公共卫生中心出院。
Patients with Newcastle Pneumonia were discharged from Shanghai Public Health Center.
传染病直报系统有需要改进的地方新京报：上海公共卫生中心参与了早期武汉的疫情防控，过程能讲一下吗？卢洪洲：我们上海公共卫生中心在1月5日提交正式的报告，从我们公共卫生的角度，我们的科学家、我们的管理者，做出了我们该做的事情。
The Shanghai Public Health Center participated in the prevention and control of the epidemic in early Wuhan, could you tell us something about itLuHong Zhou: Our Shanghai Public Health Center submitted a formal report on January 5th, and from our public health point of view, our scientists, our managers, have done what we should do.
我们样本来源是合法合理，我们做了工作，可以说发现以后，我们也按照相关的规定，因为事关重大，我们及时、紧急上报。
The source of our samples is legal and reasonable, we have done our work, we can say that after the discovery, we also comply with the relevant regulations, because the matter is important, we report in a timely and urgent manner.
我们做好我们该做的事情。
We do what we have to do.
过程我只能用“惊心动魄”来形容。
I can only describe the process as "breathtaking."
但是我们是做出了正确的选择，做出了正确的决定，该做的都做了。
But we made the right choices, made the right decisions, and did everything we had to do.
报告是敲了我们单位正式的章，不是一个随随便便的报告，这就说明了我们的重视程度，包括后面的几个报告。
The fact that the report is an official chapter of our unit, not an offhand report, illustrates the degree of importance we attach to it, including in subsequent reports.
但是非常遗憾，不该发生的事情还是发生了。
But I'm sorry things didn't happen.
我想历史总归会有一个客观公正的说法。
I think history will always have an objective and fair story.
新京报：通过这次疫情，关于新发传染病的监测和上报，有什么建议？卢洪洲：传染病的直报系统有需要改进的地方。
The Beijing News: What are the recommendations for monitoring and reporting new infectious diseases through this outbreak? Luk Hong Chau: There is room for improvement in the direct reporting system for infectious diseases.
国家一定会加大在公共卫生领域，包括法制、管理等方面的完善。
The state will certainly increase its efforts to improve public health, including the legal system and management.
SARS以后，这是一次更大的代价，不应该再出现了。
After SARS, it was a bigger price to pay and should not be repeated.
我个人的建议是，要讲科学、要透明。
My personal advice is to speak of science and transparency.
习主席讲得非常好，老百姓人民的生命健康是最重要的。
Xi said very well that the life and health of ordinary people is the most important thing.
传染病是群体性事件，不能总是以避免社会恐慌为理由，不及时透明传达。
Communicable diseases are mass events that cannot always be conveyed in a transparent and timely manner on the grounds of avoiding social panic.
老百姓不知道，就不会采取措施，会增加传播。
Ordinary people do not know, will not take measures, will increase the spread.
只有信息公开透明，让老百姓知道，才能够避免传播。
Dissemination can be avoided only if information is open and transparent and accessible to the public.
