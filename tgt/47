“我在家族群里说，科室工作群里每天都有很多接诊信息，护士长已经连续工作48小时，还有护士生病了。
"I told the family that there was a lot of information going on in the office every day, that the head nurse had been working for 48 hours and that the nurse was ill.
选择当医生、当护士肯定是有风险，但我会做好防护。
It must be risky to choose to be a doctor or a nurse, but I will protect myself.
我返回岗位继续工作不是为了当英雄，但是不能做逃兵。
I didn't return to work to be a hero, but I couldn't be a deserter.
”全文2771字，阅读约需5.5分钟1月28日，新京报记者从武汉大学中南医院获悉，该院急诊科护士郭琴因连续多日救护新型冠状病毒肺炎重症患者，不幸被感染。
On January 28, Xinhua News reported from Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital that Guoqin, the hospital's emergency nurse, had been infected after days of intensive care for a new coronavirus pneumonia.
1月27日康复后，她主动要求返回岗位。
After recovering on 27 January, she volunteered to return to her post.
当日晚间，忙了10多个小时的郭琴告诉记者，被确诊后也害怕过，但她相信自己的同事和医疗团队。

”▲武汉大学中南医院护士郭琴因工作不慎感染新型肺炎，治愈后主动重返工作岗位。
Guo Qin, a nurse at Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital, returned to work after suffering from a new type of pneumonia due to careless work.

新京报：你是如何被感染的？郭琴：我是急诊科的护士，疫情发生后，就诊的发热患者很多，我每天在急诊病房照顾重症患者，一天收治、照料的患者近百名，在病房一待就是10个小时。
How did you get infected? Guo Qin: I am a nurse in the emergency department. After the outbreak, I have a lot of fever patients. I take care of serious patients in the emergency ward every day.
后来我才知道，就是在救治新型冠状病毒患者期间，我被患者通过飞沫或因接触传染了。
Later I learned that it was during the treatment of the new coronavirus patient that I was infected by droplets or by contact.
新京报：感染后你的身体情况怎么样？郭琴：1月12日22时晚上，我发烧了，体温37.8度，当晚我吃了退烧药。
The Beijing News: How is your health after the infection? Guo Qin: On January 12 at 22: 00 pm, I had a fever and my temperature was 37.8 degrees.
第二 天我开始头痛、高烧不退、四肢乏力，关节和肌肉酸痛，赶快联系医院用急 救车把我从家里拉走。
The next day I began to have a headache, high fever, weak limbs, joint and muscle pain, quickly contact the hospital with an emergency car to pull me away from home.
经过检查被确诊患新型冠状病毒肺炎，医院安排我住 进了隔离病房。
After the examination was diagnosed with the new coronavirus pneumonia, the hospital arranged my stay in the isolation ward.
新京报：确诊后害怕了吗？郭琴：刚发热被急救车拉走时，我比较担心和沮丧，嘴上劝家人不要担心， 让丈夫在家里不要来看我，但还是给丈夫留了“遗言”。
Guo Qin: When I first had a fever and was taken away by the ambulance, I was more worried and frustrated. I advised my family not to worry about my husband coming to see me at home.
“我要是死了，一定照顾好11岁的儿子，照顾好双方的老人。
"If I die, I will take care of my 11-year-old son and the elderly on both sides.
”之后我就在想，这些年什么样的患者没有接触过。
"Then I wondered what kind of patient I hadn't had contact with over the years.
我大学毕业后就到中南医院当护士，做了15年了，一直在急诊科重症抢救室工作，那么多重症患者不都救过来了嘛，要相信自己同事和团队可以成功处置疫情。
After graduating from college, I worked as a nurse in Zhongnan Hospital for 15 years. I have been working in the intensive care unit of the emergency department.
还有同事给我拥抱、鼓励，说实话，我内心的担心和沮丧很快就过去了。
There were also colleagues who hugged and encouraged me, and to tell the truth, my inner fears and frustrations quickly passed.
新京报：当时医护人员做了哪些防护？郭琴：我们平时会穿戴蓝色隔离服和医用口罩，今年情况比较特殊，就戴了 N95口罩、护目镜，把蓝色隔离服穿在里面，最外面再穿一层白色防护服。
Guoqin: We used to wear blue paraphernalia and medical masks. This year, we wear N95 masks, goggles, blue protective clothing on the inside and white protective clothing on the outside.
春冬两季是流感的高发季节，今年元旦节前后开始，到我们医院就诊的发热 病人和感染流感的病人特别多，比往年至少要多两倍，其中有一些被确诊为 新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎患者。
Spring and winter flu season is high. Starting around New Year's Day this year, the number of febrile patients and patients infected with influenza in our hospital is particularly high, at least twice as many as in previous years.
我们每天要接触、救治大量患者，即使做了很好的防护，但还是不能保证不 被传染。
We have to contact and treat a large number of patients every day, even with good protection, but there is no guarantee that they will not be infected.
我们家离医院有40多分钟的路，那几天忙起来每天也就睡5个小时。
Our house is more than 40 minutes away from the hospital and I sleep five hours a day on busy days.
睡眠不足，饭不能按时吃，免疫力也有所下降。
Lack of sleep, rice can not eat on time, immunity has been reduced.

Guoqin: On the day of hospital isolation, I took and received antiviral, anti-bacterial drugs, and the next day I had a fever and had a much lighter body.
当时每天都有新增的感染患者，医院床位不够，我就申请回家隔离治疗。

在家那几天我坚持吃达菲（奥司他韦），是抗流感的药。
I insisted on taking Tamiflu (oseltamivir) for a few days at home. It was an anti-flu drug.
再者就是肉和鸡蛋 ，补充蛋白，吃新鲜水果蔬菜，让身体保持一个放松的状态。
Also, meat and eggs, protein supplements, eating fresh fruits and vegetables, keep the body relaxed.
新京报：在家中隔离治疗会影响家人吗？郭琴：那几天我住在我妈家，自己住一间房，我一直戴着口罩，除了爸妈送饭，平时房门不打开，偶尔开窗透透风。

I also have colleagues and leaders to send flowers, books, home medical books, to supplement some knowledge of flu prevention, treatment, quite a full.
新京报：为什么康复后就回到岗位呢？郭琴：我住院的第一天晚上，本该是我和另一位同事值夜班，因为患者多，外面的监护仪器一直响，响声代表着一直有患者找医护人员帮忙，而我没有办法帮忙，听着同事的脚步声跑来跑去忙个没停，挺心疼的。
Guoqin: On my first night in hospital, I was supposed to be on night shift with another coworker because of the number of patients, the constant sound of outside monitoring devices, the sound of patients seeking medical help.
我们急诊一共48位医护人员，重症抢救有10位医护人员，那段时间都是3班倒，还得加班，都挺疲惫的。
We had 48 emergency medical staff, 10 intensive care workers, all three shifts, but also had to work overtime, are very tired.
住院第二天，我退烧了，本来想继续上班，单位说不行，还要继续治疗、隔离观察。
Hospital the next day, I had a fever, would like to continue to work, the unit said no, but also to continue treatment, isolation observation.
康复后，我身体状况好了，我是护士又是党员，就想马上重返岗位，为同事分担压力。

通讯员 高翔 摄━━━━━“不为当英雄，也不想做逃兵”新京报：家人支持你的决定吗？郭琴：他们劝我不要继续工作，说的很委婉。
2007-9-19 15: 55 Not Being a Hero and Not Wanting to Be a Deserter The Beijing News: Do my family support your decision? Guo Qin: They advise me not to go on working.
家族群里有很多亲戚劝我多休息几天，说我上有老下有小，好好考虑下。
There were many relatives in the family who advised me to take a few more days off, saying I was up and down and thinking about it.
新京报：你是怎么回应他们的？郭琴：我丈夫是老师，非常支持我的决定，孩子今年上6年级，也让我加油。

说了这些就没有人再说什么了，大家都能理解。
That said, no one said anything more, and everyone understood.
新京报：重返医院后觉得有什么变化？郭琴：医院就诊病人明显减少了，欣慰的是返岗第一天就得知，同事们两周前救治的一名新型冠状病毒肺炎患者也康复出院了。
Guo: There has been a marked decrease in hospital visits, and I am glad to learn on the first day of my return that a new coronavirus pneumonia patient treated by colleagues two weeks ago has also recovered from hospital discharge.
这个患者是我们医院最初确诊的新型冠状病毒肺炎患者，到院后持续高烧不退，呼吸频率特别快，一度昏迷，好在救治及时，通过ECMO技术成功救治。
This patient is our hospital's initial diagnosis of the new coronavirus pneumonia patients, continued high fever after the hospital, breathing frequency is particularly fast, a coma, Fortunately in time, through ECMO technology to successfully treat.
但是只有重症患者可以通过ECMO救治，一般患者用不到这个。
But only severe cases can be treated with ECMO, which is not available to the general population.
注：公开资料显示，ECMO技术原理是将体内的静脉血引出体外，经过特殊材 质人工心肺旁路氧合后注入病人动脉或静脉系统，起到部分心肺替代作用。
Note: The principle of ECMO technique is to extract the blood from the body and inject it into the arterial or venous system of the patient through special artificial cardiopulmonary bypass and act as a partial cardiopulmonary replacement.

The Beijing News: Is the stock of hospital supplies enough nowGuo Qin: Just started to have enough medical supplies such as masks and protective clothing.
口罩要4个小时换一个，喝水、上厕所防护服暴露了，就需要换一次。
It takes 4 hours to change a mask, water, toilet protective clothing exposed, you need to change.
我们有护士为了节约防护服，基本不喝水不吃饭，也不去厕所，这样对自己身体不好。
We have nurses to save protective clothing, basic do not drink water do not eat, and do not go to the toilet, which is not good for their own health.
新京报：作为一名感染者，又是一名护士，有什么想对大家说的？郭琴：大家一定要相信医生，身体不适立即就医，现在国家卫健委印发新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎诊疗方案（试行第四版），对这个病的介绍很详细，预防和治疗说的也很详细了，大家可以看一看。
The Beijing News: As an infected person and a nurse, what would you like to tell us? Guo Qin: You must trust your doctor and seek medical attention immediately. Now the State Council of Health has issued a new diagnosis and treatment programme for coronavirus infection (version 4 of the trial).
要注意的是，不要到人员密集的地方去，出门一定要戴口罩，口罩不要反复 使用。
Be careful not to go to a crowded place. Wear a mask when you go out. Do not use it repeatedly.
这个病没那么可怕，可以治得好，大家不必恐慌。
