23.02.2020本文字数：4209，阅读时长大约7分钟导读：尽管1月20日这天还没有人知道会有这么多人感染新冠肺炎，但民众开始逐渐意识到新冠肺炎疫情的严重，这源于两个标志性事件。
Although no one knows how many people will get pneumonia on January 20th, people are coming to realize the severity of the outbreak, which is due to two iconic events.
作者 | 第一财经陈益刊2019年12月，武汉已经进入寒冬，最低气温逼近0度。
In December 2019, Wuhan entered a cold winter with temperatures approaching 0 degrees.
没有人会想到，伴随武汉进入寒冬的，不是冬雪，也不是大雨，而是一场令人震惊的特大疫情。
No one would have thought that Wuhan into the winter, not winter snow, nor heavy rain, but a shocking epidemic.
从病患的陆续发现，到医生拉响警报，再到疫情信息第一次公之于众，以及专家对病毒危害和传染性的不断认知，甚至最后发展到武汉封城，全国驰援，全民抗疫，事件已持续近两个月，至今仍未结束。
It has lasted nearly two months, from the discovery of the disease, to the alarm sounded by doctors, to the first public release of information on the epidemic, and the constant knowledge of experts on the dangers and infectious diseases of the virus.
回顾整个事件的缘起、发展、过程以及中间的点点滴滴，是为了更好地反思和总结，我们无须回避当初的预警不足和仓促应对，也不必回避我们在疫情防控系统和公共卫生管理上的短板。
Looking back at the origins, development, course, and intermingling of events for better reflection and conclusion, we need not shy away from the original inadequate warning and hasty response, as well as from our shortcomings in disease control systems and public health management.
正视当下，是为了更好地指向未来。
Facing up to the present is to better point to the future.
对于这场疫情，人们最早获悉的信息，是2019年12月30日晚间，网络上传播的两份文件，一份名为《关于做好不明原因肺炎救治工作的紧急通知》，另一份是《市卫生健康委关于报送不明原因肺炎救治情况的紧急通知》。
The first known information about the outbreak was two documents circulated on the Internet on the evening of 30 December 2019, one entitled "Emergency Notice on the Treatment of Unknown Causes of Pneumonia" and the other "Emergency Notice from the Municipal Health Commission on the Reporting of Unexplained Pneumonia Treatment."
两文件的落款时间都是12月30日。
Both documents are due on 30 December.
这两份文件透露出一个重要信息：武汉的确正在发生一场不明原因肺炎疫情。
These two documents reveal an important message: Wuhan is indeed suffering from an unknown cause of pneumonia.
不过，绝大多数武汉人并没有看到这些信息。
However, the vast majority of Wuhan people did not see this information.
看到这些信息的人也将信将疑，生活跟往常一样平静。
Those who read the message will also be skeptical, and life will be as calm as usual.
打破这一平静的，是12月31日一篇来自第一财经、题为《武汉不明原因肺炎已做好隔离，检测结果将第一时间对外公布》的报道。
Breaking this calm, December 31, a report from the First Finance, entitled "Wuhan unknown causes of pneumonia has been isolated, test results will be announced the first time.
这是机构媒体首次披露疫情，并从武汉市卫健委处独家证实了上述文件的真实性。
This is the first time that the agency's media disclosed the epidemic and confirmed the authenticity of the documents from Wuhan Health Care Commission.
此后，大批媒体的跟进及武汉市卫健委的公开通报，引发了世人对这场疫情的全面关注。
Since then, a large number of media follow-up and Wuhan Health Commission of the public notice, has aroused the world's comprehensive attention to the epidemic.
不过，陆续公布的论文、官方文件和第一财经后续对患者的采访显示，疫情的发生还应上溯到更早的时候。
However, published papers, official documents and first financial follow-up interviews with patients show that the outbreak of the epidemic should also date back to earlier times.
医生拉响警报这场疫情的爆发的中心，目前依然聚焦在位于武汉市江汉区的华南海鲜批发市场（下称“华南市场”）。
Doctors sounded the alarm about the outbreak, which is still focused on the South China Wholesale Seafood Market ("South China Market") in the Jianghan district of Wuhan.
12月19日，在华南市场经营干货铺的摊主刘冰（化名）发高烧，浑身无力，肌肉酸疼。
December 19, the South China market dry goods shop owner Liu Bing (alias) high fever, all over weak, muscle pain.
他的妻子苏丽（化名）不久后也感到不适。
His wife, Suri (not her real name), soon felt ill, too.
“像感冒，不过我是低烧（37.5度），浑身没力气。
"It's like a cold, but I have a low fever (37.5 degrees) and I don't have any energy.
”苏丽2月20日对第一财经记者回忆道。
"Su Li February 20 recalled to the first financial reporter.
苏丽的父亲跟他们住一起，不久后也感到身体不适。
Sully's father lived with them and soon became ill.
随后，夫妻二人来到华中科技大学同济医学院附属同济医院。
Later, the husband and wife came to Tongji Medical College Tongji Hospital.
医生在给两人做相关检查后，没有查出病原，但肺部阴影重，因此医生按照肺炎给他们治疗，两人症状有所减轻。
When the doctors examined the two men, they did not find the cause of the disease, but the shadows in the lungs were so heavy that the doctors treated them with pneumonia and the symptoms in both cases were alleviated.
“当时医生也不知道我们得了什么病。
"The doctor didn't know what was wrong with us.
”苏丽说。
'she said.
像刘冰一样，整个去年12月，在华南市场工作的20多人出现了类似症状。
Like Liu Bing, more than 20 people working in the South China market developed similar symptoms throughout December.
他们分别到湖北省中西医结合医院、同济医院、武汉市中心医院等医院就医，引起了医生们的警惕。
They went to Hubei Province combined Chinese and Western medicine hospitals, Tongji Hospital, Wuhan City Central Hospital and other hospitals, aroused the vigilance of doctors.
最早拉响警报的，是湖北省中西医结合医院呼吸与重症医学科主任张继先。
The earliest alarms were Zhang Jixian, director of respiratory and severe medicine department of Hubei Province combined Chinese and Western medicine.
她在发现多起“不明原因肺炎”病例后，12月27日将这一情况反映给医院，医院立即上报江汉区疾控中心。
She found a number of cases of "unknown causes of pneumonia," December 27 to reflect this situation to the hospital, which immediately reported to the Jianghan District CDC.
29日，医院发现这些患者中的大部分人都有华南市场接触史后，当天立即向省、市卫健委的疾控处报告。
29, the hospital found that most of these patients have access to the South China market history, the day immediately reported to the provincial, municipal health committee disease control office.
这立即引起了官方重视。
This immediately attracted official attention.
29日当天，一场针对华南市场不明原因肺炎的调查处置工作正式启动，并在第二天拿出了报告。
29, a South China market for unknown causes of pneumonia investigation and disposal officially launched, and the next day produced a report.
第一财经获得的这份调查处置报告显示，截至2019年12月30日，武汉市累计搜索不明原因肺炎病例25例，完成流行病学调查核实20例，这些病例中就包括刘冰一家人。
The report on the handling of the investigation obtained by First Finance shows that as of December 30, 2019, Wuhan city had accumulated 25 cases of unexplained pneumonia and completed an epidemiological investigation to verify 20 cases, including the Liu Bing family.
正是这一天，关于武汉不明原因肺炎的“小道消息”开始在网上传开。
It was on this day that "rumors" began to circulate online about the unexplained pneumonia in Wuhan.
12月30日，武汉市中心医院眼科医生李文亮看到一份病人的检测报告，报告标注有“SARS冠状病毒”。
December 30, Wuhan Central Hospital ophthalmologist Li Wenliang saw a patient's test report marked "SARS coronavirus."
他提醒同为临床医生的同学注意防护。
He warned his fellow clinicians to watch out for protection.
“冠状病毒感染确定了，正在进行病毒分型”。
"The coronavirus infection has been confirmed and the virus is being typed.
他在微信群里的发言被人截屏流传出来，让一些市民开始警觉。
His speech in the microphone group was broadcast on screen, alerting some citizens.
但处于疫情风暴中心的华南市场，却依然如往日一样忙碌。
But the South China market, at the epicentre of the storm, remains as busy as ever.
12月31日13时，第一财经记者在华南市场看到，这个有600多个摊位的市场，摊主们像往日一样照常营业，一些市民逛着市场买肉类等食品，整个市场戴口罩的人寥寥无几。
At 1300 hours on December 31, the first financial reporter saw in the South China market that there were more than 600 stalls. The stalls were open as usual. Some people visited the market to buy meat and other foodstuffs.
在市场西区，店铺紧凑，销售后产生的垃圾随处堆放，地面肮脏潮湿，通风较差。
In the western part of the market, the shops are compact, the rubbish generated after sale is piled up everywhere, the ground is dirty and damp, ventilation is poor.
记者当时随机采访的二三十个摊主中，大部分人并不知道这里有人得了不明原因肺炎。
Of the twenty or thirty vendors interviewed at random, most did not know that someone here had pneumonia for unknown reasons.
即便一些摊主看到了媒体上午的报道，也斥责这是假新闻、造谣炒作而已。
Even though some of the stalls saw the media coverage this morning, they denounced it as false news and disinformation.
不过也有个别摊主悄悄戴上了口罩。
But a few vendors have quietly put on masks.
一位华南市场管理人员见记者戴口罩和手套、穿鞋套来采访，第一句话是：“你这也太夸张了。
"You're exaggerating," says one South China marketing executive, who saw reporters wearing masks and gloves and shoes.
看你这样子要把我吓死。
Look at the way you're scaring me to death.
”31日13:38，武汉市卫健委官网发布《关于当前我市肺炎疫情的情况通报》，称近期部分医疗机构发现接诊的多例肺炎病例与华南海鲜城有关联，通过搜索和回顾性调查，目前已发现27例病例，其中7例病情严重，其余病例病情稳定可控，有2例病情好转，拟于近期出院。
"At 13: 38 on May 31, Wuhan Health Officers' Network issued the" Notice on the current situation of pneumonia in our city, "said the recent discovery of several cases of pneumonia in some medical institutions and Huaxian City, through search and retrospective investigation, has found 27 cases, 7 of which are serious, the rest are stable and two cases are expected to be released in the near future.
这是官方首次正式对外通报华南市场发生了不明原因肺炎疫情。
This is the official first official external notification of the South China market occurred unknown pneumonia epidemic.
记者将手机上的这则公告页面递给一位斥责媒体“造谣”的女摊主看，她还没读完全文，就急忙抬头问对面的摊主是否有口罩。
The reporter on the mobile phone this announcement page to a reprimand media "rumor" female stall owner, she did not read the full text, hastily raised his head to ask the owner of the opposite stall whether there is a mask.
当得知有后，她飞奔过去抓起一个口罩就戴上，旁边围观的几人大笑。
When she heard about it, she rushed over to grab a mask and put it on. Several of the bystanders laughed.
第二天，即2020年1月1日，华南市场被勒令休市进行环境卫生整治。
The next day, January 1, 2020, the South China market was ordered to suspend environmental sanitation.
不久后，武汉不明原因肺炎的病原体被国家卫健委初步判定为新型冠状病毒。
Soon after, the Wuhan unidentified cause of pneumonia pathogen was initially judged by the National Health Commission as a new coronavirus.
不过，1月30日新英格兰医学期刊（NEJM）发表的论文《新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎在中国武汉的早期传播动力学》称，有证据表明，早在2019年12月12日之前，最先出现的病例并无华南市场接触史。
However, according to the paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) on January 30, "Early Transmission Dynamics of Pneumonia Infected by the New Coronavirus in Wuhan, China," there is evidence that the first cases did not have a history of exposure to the South China market as early as December 12, 2019.
这意味着，病毒的来源和始发地还有待更多的探索和解析。
This means that the origin and origin of the virus still need more exploration and analysis.
两个标志性事件元旦后，武汉不少医院的发热门诊看病人数激增。
After the two landmark New Year's Day, the number of people visiting the fever clinic in Wuhan surged.
病人排起了长队，收治病床渐渐变得一床难求。
There were long queues of patients, and the hospital beds gradually became inaccessible.
不过，外界观察疫情进展的主要窗口——武汉市卫健委通报的疫情数据却显示，相当长一段时间里病例没有增加，反而有所减少，这让外界以为疫情被控制住了。
However, data from the Wuhan Health Commission, the main window of progress, show that the number of cases has not increased for quite some time, but has decreased, giving the impression that the epidemic is under control.
2019年12月31日至2020年1月17日这18天时间里，官方数据中的新型冠状病毒肺炎确诊病例从27例增至59例后，开始下降至41例，其间长达12天没有新增病例。
In the 18-day period from December 31, 2019 to January 17, 2020, the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus pneumonia in official data increased from 27 to 59, and began to decline to 41, with no new cases recorded for 12 days.
湖北之外的省份，也没有病例报告。
No cases have been reported in provinces outside Hubei.
但在中国周边国家和地区，泰国和日本一共出现三例确认病例，且都有武汉旅居史。
But in China's neighboring countries and regions, Thailand and Japan have a total of three confirmed cases, and all have Wuhan residence history.
此时，中国香港、越南、新加坡等地，也出现了疑似病例，但均未确认。
At this time, Hong Kong, China, Vietnam, Singapore, and other places, also appeared suspicious cases, but did not confirm.
而在这12天时间里，武汉市和湖北省的两会相继召开。
In this 12-day period, Wuhan and Hubei provinces held the two conferences one after the other.
1月6日至10日，武汉市召开两会。
From January 6 to 10, Wuhan held two conferences.
1月11日至17日，湖北省召开两会。
From January 11 to 17, two conferences were held in Hubei province.
武汉市卫健委的前期通报宣称“未发现明确的人传人证据，未发现医务人员感染。
Wuhan health committee of the early announcement declared that "no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission, no medical staff found infection.
该病可防可控”；后期通报还称“密切接触者中，没有发现相关病例”。
"The disease is preventable and controllable," the report said later, adding that "close contacts, no relevant cases were found."
这些说法，在相当程度上导致武汉乃至湖北各界缺乏警惕、疏于防护。
These claims, to a considerable extent, led to Wuhan and even Hubei communities lack vigilance, negligence of protection.
1月18日，农历小年，武汉江岸区百步亭社区还举办了声势浩大的“万家宴”活动。
On January 18, the Lunar New Year, Wuhan Jianjiang District Baebu Ting community also held a huge "million banquet" activities.
后来，武汉市长周先旺在接受央视采访时对此作了反思。
Later, Wuhan City Chang Zhou Xianwang in an interview with CCTV made a reflection on this.
他说，今年之所以继续举办百步亭万家宴这个活动，是基于“之前我们对这一次疫情传播、是对人与人之间有限性传播的这个判断，对这件事预警不够” 。
He said the Bumpting family dinner continued this year on the basis of "our previous assessment of the spread of the epidemic, the limited transmission between people, and the lack of early warning about it."
1月18日开始，长期“稳定”在41例的新冠肺炎确诊病例数开始快速增长，到20日，全国确诊病例数已经增至291例。
Since January 18, the long-term "stable" number of confirmed cases of pneumonia in the new crown has begun to grow rapidly, and by 20 January, the number of confirmed cases nationwide had increased to 291.
实际上，当时未确诊的感染人数远远超过这一数字。
Indeed, the number of undiagnosed infections at that time far exceeded that figure.
后来国家疾控中心的研究显示，截至1月20日，全国至少有6174例新冠肺炎患者发病。
A study by the National CDC later showed that as of January 20, there were at least 6,174 new cases of pneumonia nationwide.
新一期的《中华流行病学杂志》刊登的《新型冠状病毒肺炎流行病学特征分析》一文还披露，在1月10日之前，全国20个省份已出现病例。
The new epidemiological profile of coronavirus pneumonia, published in the new issue of the Chinese Journal of Epidemiology, also revealed that by January 10, there had been cases in 20 provinces.
此文通过对截至2020年2月11日中国内地报告的超过7万多病例的流行病学特征进行分析，发现新冠肺炎病人发病时间在经历12月到1月初的缓慢发展后，在1月10日开始陡然上升。
Through an analysis of the epidemiological characteristics of more than 70,000 reported cases in the Mainland of China as of February 11, 2020, it is found that the onset of New Crown Pneumonia, after a slow progression from December to early January, began to rise sharply on January 10.
在1月11日到20日（中国工程院院士、国家卫健委高级别专家组组长钟南山宣布疫情存在“人传人”那天）之间，病例暴增5417例，随后疫情彻底暴发。
Between January 11 and January 20, when Zhong Nan-shan, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and head of the nation's high-level panel of experts, announced the existence of a "person-to-person" outbreak.
尽管1月20日这天还没有人知道会有这么多人感染新冠肺炎，但民众开始逐渐意识到新冠肺炎疫情的严重，这源于两个标志性事件。
Although no one knew on January 20th that so many people would get pneumonia, people are beginning to realize the severity of the outbreak, which stems from two iconic events.
一是1月20日晚上，针对“新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情”防控情况，钟南山院士接受央视采访时首次表示疫情出现人传人和医务人员感染情况。
On January 20, in response to the prevention and control of the "new coronavirus infection pneumonia," academician Zhong Nan Shan told CCTV for the first time that human-to-human transmission and infection of medical personnel had occurred.
这一消息震动全国。
The news rocked the country.
另一个标志性事件是，1月20日晚，新华社发布消息称，疫情发生后，党中央、国务院高度重视。
In another landmark incident, on the night of January 20, Xinhua announced that the central government and the State Council attached great importance to the outbreak.
中共中央总书记、国家主席、中央军委主席习近平对新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情作出重要指示：湖北武汉市等地近期陆续发生新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情，必须引起高度重视，全力做好防控工作。
The General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, Chairman of the State Council and Chairman of the Central Military Commission Xi Jinping gave important instructions on the pneumonia epidemic of the new coronavirus infection.
同一天，国务院总理李克强主持召开国务院常务会议，进一步部署新冠肺炎疫情防控工作。
On the same day, Premier Li Keqiang hosted a State Council executive meeting to further deploy efforts to prevent and control the outbreak.
其中武汉市要严格落实防控措施，把好相关市场关闭、野生动物管控和机场、车站、码头等体温筛检关口。
Among them, Wuhan city should strictly implement the prevention and control measures, the relevant market closed, wildlife control and airports, stations, docks and other temperature screening checkpoints.
并落实早发现、早报告、早隔离、早治疗和集中救治措施。
And implement early detection, early reporting, early isolation, early treatment and concentrated treatment measures.
为落实上级部署，采取更严格的举措，内防扩散、外防输出，防止疫情扩散蔓延，武汉作出新的部署。
In order to implement the plan, China will take more stringent measures to prevent the spread of the disease and prevent the spread of the disease, and Wuhan will make new arrangements.
20日这天，武汉市成立新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情防控指挥部（下称“武汉新冠肺炎防控指挥部”），统一领导、指挥全市疫情防控。
Wuhan New Coronavirus Infection Control Command (Wuhan New Coronavirus Infection Control Command) was set up on May 20 to lead and direct the city-wide epidemic prevention and control.
政府更严格防控行动背后，是人们对新冠病毒有了颠覆性的认识。
Behind the government's stricter controls is a subversive perception of the new crown virus.
面对越来越多的发热病人，为了方便就医，20日晚武汉市公布了61家发热门诊医疗机构，和9家定点医疗机构，并承诺对确诊患者的治疗费用由政府兜底，凡在发热门诊留观的患者，门诊的治疗费也全由政府埋单。
Facing more and more febrile patients, Wuhan announced on the night of the 20th, 61 out-patient clinics and 9 designated medical institutions, and promised to treat patients diagnosed by the government, the fever clinic visitors, the cost of treatment is paid by the government.
封城：艰难的抉择由于新冠病毒能够人传人，疫情快速蔓延扩散至全国其他地方。
Sealing: Hard Choices With the New Crown Virus able to spread from person to person, the epidemic is spreading rapidly to other parts of the country.
加之病例检测速度加快，从1月21日开始，武汉的确诊病例快速增长。
Coupled with the accelerated case detection rate, from January 21, Wuhan, confirmed cases of rapid growth.
22日，湖北省启动突发公共卫生事件II级应急响应。
On February 22, Hubei Province launched a public health emergency response level II.
武汉市当日要求在该市公共场所实施佩戴口罩的控制措施。
Wuhan city asked the same day to implement mask control measures in public places in the city.
截至1月23日，国家卫健委收到29个省（区、市）累计报告新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎确诊病例830例，其中仅武汉一市就高达495例。
As of January 23, 830 cases of pneumonia with a new coronavirus infection have been reported to the state health care commission in 29 provinces (districts and cities), including 495 cases in Wuhan alone.
一些一线医护人员此时已感染上新冠肺炎。
Some frontline staff have now contracted pneumonia.
李文亮就是其中之一。
Li Wenliang is one of them.
疫情越来越严重。
The epidemic is getting worse.
为了内防扩散、外防输出，疫情重灾区的武汉，终于在23日凌晨做出一个重大决定：封城。
In order to internal non-proliferation, external defense exports, the worst affected areas of Wuhan, finally made a major decision in the early morning 23: closure.
1月23日凌晨，武汉新冠肺炎防控指挥部发布公告：自2020年1月23日10时起，该市城市公交、地铁、轮渡、长途客运暂停运营；无特殊原因，市民不要离开武汉，机场、火车站离汉通道暂时关闭。
From 1000 hours on January 23, 2020, Wuhan Xinguan Pneumonia Control Command issued a notice: From 1000 hours on January 23, 2020, the city's city bus, subway, ferry, long-distance passenger transport operation, no special reasons, not to leave Wuhan, the airport, railway stations from Han corridor temporarily closed.
作为封城建议者之一，国家卫健委高级别专家组成员、中国工程院院士李兰娟不久后接受媒体采访时表示，武汉实施进出人员管控，是因为疫情防控已经到了刻不容缓的程度，只有严格控制传染源，才能不让传染病发生大流行。
As one of the city's proponents, Li Lanjuan, a member of the high-level group of experts of the National Fitness and Health Commission and a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, told reporters shortly afterwards that the control of entry and exit of people in Wuhan had reached an urgent stage.
为什么作出这一判断？李兰娟说，因为从各省感染的情况来，武汉出来的人导致了各个省感染，不仅是一代感染，可能有的省份都已经产生了第二代感染，这是非常危险的。
Li Lanjuan said that because of the infection in the provinces, Wuhan people caused infections in all provinces, not only a generation of infections, there may be a second generation of infection, it is very dangerous.
感染如果再继续扩大，如果其他省份没有控制住，也像武汉那样蔓延，那中国的经济社会损失会很惨重。
If the infection continues to spread, and if other provinces do not control it and spread like Wuhan, China's economic and social losses will be enormous.
