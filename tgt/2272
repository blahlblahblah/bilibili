图/法新文 |《财经》特约作者 墨父 发自德黑兰 编辑 | 郝洲短短几日，新冠病毒疫情在伊朗全面爆发，从首次发现确诊病例之后不到一周就成为全球疫情第四严重的国家，且致死率居全球第一，就连主要负责抗击疫情的卫生部副部长也被确诊感染。
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New Crown Virus outbreak in Iran was the fourth most serious in the world less than a week after the first confirmed case was first discovered, and the world's leading cause of death, even the deputy health minister with primary responsibility for fighting the epidemic was diagnosed.
伊朗到底发生了什么？2月19日，距离中国湖北省武汉封城后的两个“隔离期”——整整28天，伊朗首次发现两例新冠肺炎确诊病例，发现即死亡。
WHAT Happened in Iran On February 19th, two confirmed cases of New Crown Pneumonia were discovered and died in Iran during two "quarantine periods" - exactly 28 days after the city was closed in Wuhan, Hubei Province.
随后几天，确诊病例成直线上升趋势，20日新增3例，21日新增13例，22日新增10例，23日新增15例，24日新增18例，25日新增34例，26日新增44例。
In the following days, the number of confirmed cases rose linearly, with 3 new cases on the 20th day, 13 new cases on the 21st day, 10 new cases on the 22nd, 15 new cases on the 23rd day, 18 new cases on the 24th day, 34 new cases on the 25th day and 44 new cases on the 26th day.
截止当地时间2月27日，伊朗累计确诊141例，死亡22例。
As of February 27, local time, Iran confirmed a cumulative total of 141 cases, 22 deaths.
伊朗的死亡病例数在除中国以外的国家里排名第一，超过了韩国（12例）和意大利（12例），而伊朗确诊病例仅为韩国的十分之一。
Iran ranks first among countries other than China, ahead of South Korea (12) and Italy (12), while Iran has only one-tenth the number of confirmed cases in South Korea.
按照死亡人数占确诊病例数的比例来看，伊朗疫情的致死率达到13.7%，远超疫情集中且严重的中国湖北省，湖北省目前的致死率约为4%。
In terms of the proportion of deaths in the number of confirmed cases, the mortality rate of the Iranian epidemic reached 13.7 percent, far exceeding the mortality rate of about 4 percent in Hubei Province, China, where the epidemic is concentrated and severe.
病毒究竟如何传到伊朗，这个问题至今还是一个谜。
How exactly the virus spread to Iran remains a mystery.
根据已经披露的情况，伊朗的什叶派圣城库姆应是传染源和重灾区。
According to what has been revealed, the Shiite holy city of Qom in Iran should be a source of infection and a major disaster area.
库姆距离德黑兰大概两个小时车程，城内的库姆神学院是世界最知名的宗教学院之一，法蒂玛·马苏玛陵墓被视为伊斯兰教什叶派最为神圣的地方之一。
About two hours' drive from Tehran, the Qom seminary in the city is one of the world's most famous religious colleges, and Fatima al-Masuma's tomb is considered one of the holiest places for Shiites in Islam.
根据伊朗官方公布的调查，最初确诊病例在库姆发现，库姆确诊病例最多，其他确诊病例多数有库姆旅行史。
According to official Iranian investigations, the first confirmed cases were found in Qom, with the largest number of confirmed cases in Qom, and the majority of the other confirmed cases had a Qom travel history.
伊朗卫生部部长纳马基在接受媒体采访时曾推断，“有90%以上的可能，该病毒是经由携带者从中国传入伊朗，特别是库姆市的”。
In an interview with the media, Health Minister Manouchehr al-Namaki concluded that "there is a 90 percent probability that the virus was introduced to Iran, especially the city of Qom, through carriers."
但具体是谁携带进去的，是在库姆的工人、学生、商人、旅行者？没有准确答案。
But who brought in the workers, students, businessmen, travelers in Qom? No precise answer.
纳马基表示，库姆的一例死亡病例是一位在病毒传染期曾去过中国的伊朗商人。
Namaki said the one fatality in Qom was an Iranian businessman who had been to China during the virus infection period.
也有可能是该伊朗商人在中国感染病毒后带回伊朗。
It is also possible that the Iranian businessman returned to Iran after contracting the virus in China.
所以，病毒是否源发中国？究竟由何种路径传入伊朗？病毒在伊朗是否发生变异才导致高致死率？这些问题至今没有准确答案。
So, have the viruses originated in China? What route did they travel to Iran, and did the virus mutate in Iran to cause a high fatality rate?
除了致死率高，伊朗的疫情还表现得非常平等，伊朗卫生部副部长哈里齐2月25日也宣布自己确诊感染新冠肺炎，是伊朗目前确诊感染新冠病毒的最高官员按照哈里齐的说法，这个病毒“不分高低贵贱”。
In addition to the high death rate, Iran's epidemic is showing great equality, and Iran's deputy health minister, Halizi, announced on February 25 that he had been diagnosed with New Crown Pneumonia, the country's top official yet to be diagnosed with the new crown virus, which, according to Halizi, is "indiscriminate."
伊朗总统发言人拉比伊此前与哈里齐在同一个新闻发布会上共处多时。
Iran's presidential spokesman, Ali Rabi'i, had been with him at the same news conference for a long time.
有消息说，哈里齐的确诊消息传出后，总统鲁哈尼和拉比伊都在第一时间进行了病毒检测，好在2月26日的检测结果都是阴性。
President Rouhani and Rabi both tested negative for the virus at the first sign of infection after word spread of the company's diagnosis.
此外，德黑兰第十三区的区长和国家议会的议员萨德吉也都确诊感染。
In addition, the district mayor of Tehran's thirteenth district and member of the National Assembly, Saadji, were also diagnosed with the infection.
“得不得病，全看真主的意思”疫情发生以后，伊朗10个省份的学校停课，全国体育项赛事、音乐会、艺术展等统统取消，所有电影院及公共休闲场所关停，德黑兰还禁止在公共场所举办婚礼等大型聚会，设拉子关闭了粉红清真寺等热门景点，古勒斯坦省禁止病人亲属探监，各城市的公交、地铁等公共交通也要求定期消毒。
After the outbreak, schools were closed in 10 Iranian provinces, national sports events, concerts and art exhibitions were closed, all cinemas and public leisure venues were closed, major gatherings such as weddings in public places were banned in Tehran, popular sites such as pink mosques were closed in Shiraz, relatives of patients were banned from visiting prisons in Gulastan, and public transport such as buses and subways in cities was regularly disinfected.
经过一番讨论之后，伊朗已经宣布取消本周五（2月28日）的集体礼拜活动。
After some discussion, Iran has announced it will cancel a group worship on Friday, Feb. 28.
同时，伊朗将对位于马什哈德的伊玛目礼萨圣陵和位于库姆的法蒂玛圣陵等礼拜圣地进行限流，前往礼拜的人员，必须佩戴口罩，自带洗手液，并出示健康信息。
At the same time, the Islamic Republic of Iran will impose restrictions on places of worship such as the holy shrine of Imam Reza in Mashhad and the holy shrine of Fatima in Qom. Those going to worship are required to wear masks, bring their own hand sanitizers and present health information.
其实做出这种决策对于政教合一的伊朗实属不易。
Making such decisions will not be easy for a secular Iran.
每周五的聚礼对于穆斯林来说是生活中及其重要的一部分。
Fridays are an important part of life for Muslims.
此前有教士表示读《古兰经》可以抵御病毒，有教士称在圣陵朝拜可以治病，但科学家告诉伊朗政府，疫情蔓延之时大规模有着极高的风险，所以周五的礼拜取消，这对于伊朗来说是一个极其艰难的抉择。
Earlier clerics said reading the Koran would protect against the virus, and some clerics said pilgrimage to the holy shrines would cure the disease, but scientists told the Iranian government that Friday's cancellation was a very difficult choice for Iran because of the high risks involved in spreading the outbreak.
即便如此，伊朗采取的措施与中国举全国之力严防死守的态势相比仍然较为松懈，更没有“封城”的打算。
Even so, Iran's measures remain lax compared with China's national assertiveness, not to mention its intention to "close the city."
总统鲁哈尼2月26日表示，“国家没有决定隔离任何城市，民众不要听信封城的传言，所有生活物资都有足够的供应”。
President Rouhani said on February 26, "the country has not decided to isolate any city, people do not listen to the envelope city rumors, all supplies are adequate."
封城所需的资源调动能力还有国家经济的承受能力，对于伊朗都是不可承受之重。
The ability to mobilize the resources needed to close the city, as well as the country's economic capacity, is unbearable for Iran.
就像大禹治水一样，不能“堵”时，只能选择“疏”。
Just as Dayu Zhi water, can not "block", can only choose "sparse."
最高领袖的外事顾问也是伊朗著名的儿科医生韦拉亚提身穿白大褂出现在电视上告诉民众，“新冠病毒的致死率不如流感”。
The Supreme Leader's foreign affairs adviser and well-known Iranian pediatrician, Ayatollah Ali Bayati, appeared on television and told people that "the new crown virus is not as deadly as the flu."
卫生部副部长哈里齐声称，“大多数感染者不必前往医院，在家休息喝水补充维生素就能好”，他在自己录制的视频里确实精神状态良好。
"Most infected people don't have to go to a hospital to rest at home and drink vitamin supplements," said Harry Qi, deputy minister of health.
由于国家在给努力给疫情“降温”，民众并没有产生恐慌情绪。
As the country struggles to "cool" the epidemic, there is little fear among the population.
但这只是原因之一，还有很大一部分是宗教因素让很多民众看淡生死，一名超市的管理人员解释他自己不戴口罩的原因是“得不得病，全看真主的意思”。
But that is just one reason, and a large part of it is religion that makes many people see life and death, and one supermarket manager explained that he was not wearing a mask because "it's all God's will."
笔者在当地观察到，伊朗民众在疫情不断蔓延的同时没有采取很好的保护措施，街头上戴口罩的民众也就在10%左右，拥堵的德黑兰交通也没有因为疫情而缓解，多数人还是像往常一样工作生活。
I have observed on the ground that the Iranian population has not taken adequate protective measures as the epidemic continues to spread. The number of people wearing masks on the streets is around 10 per cent. Traffic in the congested city of Tehran has not been alleviated and most people are still working as usual.
更有意思的，由于学校停课，一些学生竟然组团去伊朗北部里海附近度假游玩，而那里的城市同样也有确诊病例，此事让卫生部直接喊话，“让你们停课不是让你们出去旅游的，都在宿舍老实待着”。
Even more interestingly, some students have taken vacations around the Caspian Sea in northern Iran, where there have also been confirmed cases, prompting the Health Ministry to shout, "It's not going to be a holiday for you, just stay in the dorm."
虽然多数民众表现得情绪稳定，但药店里的口罩、酒精、消毒水已经被抢购一空。
Although most people are showing signs of emotional stability, pharmacies have been snapped up with masks, alcohol and disinfectant.
长期遭受制裁的伊朗，在医疗物资、医疗条件上确实没有办法应付疫情大规模爆发而产生的医疗需求上升。
Long-suffering Iran does not have the means, in terms of medical supplies and conditions, to cope with the rising demand for health care caused by a massive outbreak of the disease.
遭进一步孤立伊朗的病毒是否来源于中国尚无定论，但是有很多国家的确诊病例已经确定是经由伊朗“输送”过去的。
Whether the virus that further isolates Iran comes from China is debatable, but confirmed cases in many countries have been confirmed to have been "transported" through Iran.
2月20日，加拿大不列颠哥伦比亚省确诊的第6例是一名从伊朗返回的30多岁的妇女。
On 20 February, the sixth confirmed case in British Columbia, Canada, was a woman in her thirties who had returned from Iran.
21日，黎巴嫩发现的第1例病例系一名从库姆回国的45岁黎巴嫩妇女。
On 21 July, the first case detected in Lebanon was that of a 45-year-old Lebanese woman who had returned from Qom.
22日，阿联酋再添两名确诊病例，为一名70岁的伊朗游客和他64岁的妻子。
22, the United Arab Emirates added two confirmed cases, a 70-year-old Iranian tourist and his 64-year-old wife.
笔者自己统计了一下各国发现的伊朗输送确诊病例人数，科威特43人，黎巴嫩2人，伊拉克4人，巴林26人，阿曼2人，阿联酋2人，巴基斯坦1人，加拿大1人，还有一名中国人从伊朗返回中国后被确诊。
I have my own statistics on the number of confirmed cases found in Iran, 43 in Kuwait, 2 in Lebanon, 4 in Iraq, 26 in Bahrain, 2 in Oman, 2 in the United Arab Emirates, 1 in Pakistan, 1 in Canada and 1 Chinese who returned to China from Iran.
当伊朗成为中东“毒源”以后，各国都紧急关闭了与伊朗的空中、陆地交通，除上述发现了来自伊朗确诊病例的国家外，土耳其、塔吉克斯坦等也切断与伊朗的联系，伊朗几乎成为一座孤岛。
When Iran became a "source" in the Middle East, countries immediately shut down air and land traffic with Iran, and, in addition to the countries from which Iran was identified, Turkey and Tajikistan, among others, severed ties with Iran, making it almost an island.
依然滞留在伊朗的中国人惊恐地发现，此前因为中国疫情伊朗与中国间的直航都已取消，而之前通过迪拜、莫斯科、伊斯坦布尔等城市转机的回国路径也已经被堵死，几无退路。
The Chinese, still in Iran, were horrified to discover that direct flights between Iran and China had been cancelled because of the Chinese epidemic, and that the return route through cities such as Dubai, Moscow and Istanbul had been blocked.
