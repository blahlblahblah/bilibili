The respondents were not far from Wuhan for a picture of an end-of-year meal-induced infection.
1月17日下午，申波自驾赴武汉参加公司年底聚餐，作为这家保险企业在黄石分公司的高管，这样的“双城奔波”对申波来说已是常态。
On the afternoon of January 17, he drove himself to Wuhan to attend a company dinner at the end of the year. As an executive of the insurance company's branch in Yellowstone, such a "two-city rush" has become the norm for Shenbo.
“当时在疑似SARS的消息引发担忧之后，专家说持续人传人风险较低，于是公司领导就安排我们部分高级管理者去武汉一起聚个餐。
"After concerns about the suspected SARS outbreak were raised, experts said the risk of a continuing human-to-human transmission was low, so the company's leadership arranged for some of our senior managers to go to Wuhan to have a dinner together.
”申波对澎湃新闻如是说。
"said Shin Boo to the surging news.
申波到达武汉时没有见到有人做防护，因为当时大家都认为“不会人传人，没有新增病例，病情也是可控的”。
Shen Bo arrived in Wuhan did not see protection, because at that time everyone thought "no human-to-human, no new cases, the disease is controllable."
当天聚餐结束，申波顺便把在武汉的13岁女儿娜娜接回黄石的家，和父母一起过年。
At the end of the dinner, Shen Bo picked up Huang Shi's 13-year-old daughter in Wuhan and spent the New Year with her parents.
1月19日，申波开始发低烧。
On January 19, Shen Bo began to have a low fever.
当时他以为这只是受凉或者过度劳累，没有放在心上。
At the time, he thought it was just cold or overworked and ignored it.
由于身体不适，申波把公司原定23日才开始的假期提前到了20日开始。
Due to ill health, Shenbo has brought forward the company's scheduled 23-day holiday to the beginning of the 20th.
但对于员工们年底聚餐的提议，他没有采纳。
But he did not take up the idea of staff having dinner at the end of the year.
“事后回想起来很后怕，但又很万幸，不然如果真的聚餐，不知道又要拖多少人下水。
"In hindsight it was very scary, but fortunately, if it really dinner, I do not know how many people have to drag into the water.
”申波说。
'he said.
三天后，申波被确诊为新冠肺炎入院。
Three days later, Shenbo was admitted to hospital with New Crown Pneumonia.
申波告诉记者，他是最早发病的。
Shen Bo told reporters that he is the earliest onset of illness.
之后，当时参与公司聚餐的近一百位同事中，有十几个人也陆续被确诊为新冠肺炎病例。
More than a dozen of the nearly 100 co-workers at the company's dinner party were later confirmed to be newly diagnosed with pneumonia.
“后来我发现，我们吃饭的酒店距离华南海鲜市场还不到一公里。
"Later I discovered that the hotel where we ate was less than a kilometer from the South China seafood market.
”“阎王爷要收我就让他收，不收我就好好活着。
"" Yama, let him take it, or live well without me.
”直到1月21号高烧至38.9℃，申波才去了家附近的黄石市中医医院钟楼院区就诊。
"It was not until January 21, when his fever hit 38.9, that he went to the Zhong Lou compound of the Huangshi Hospital near his home.
由于没有咳嗽、头痛等其他症状，申波没往新冠肺炎上想。
Without cough, headache and other symptoms, Shen Bo did not think of the new crown pneumonia.
但出于谨慎，他检查了甲流和乙流，结果都是阴性。
Prudently, however, he examined the A and B streams and found them to be negative.
于是，申波让医生开了几副中药准备回家慢慢养病。
So, Shen Bo let the doctor open a few Chinese medicine ready to go home to slowly recover.
“以往感冒发烧的时候，我吃中药就能治愈，但没想到这次完全控制不了。
"I used to take Chinese medicine to cure a fever when I had a cold, but I didn't expect it to be completely out of control.
”1月22日，申波再次高烧不退，在黄石市中医医院钟楼院区，医生给他打了针。
On January 22, Shenbo suffered another high fever and was given an injection by doctors at the Bell Tower of Huangshi City's TCM Hospital.
那时他发现，急诊，发热门诊的医生们都开始穿上了防护服。
At the time, he found that doctors at the emergency and fever clinics were starting to put on protective clothing.
23日，高烧变得更加严重，申波说，当时母亲用浸了酒精的冷毛巾为他物理降温，“我母亲都七十多岁了。
"My mother was in her seventies," he said, as her mother cooled him physically with a cold towel soaked in alcohol.
”反反复复的降温，但高烧一直持续到晚上，申波感觉自己“实在扛不住了”。
"Repeated cooling, but high fever continued into the evening, Shenbo felt that he" really can not carry. "
当天他被家人送到了黄石市中医医院钟楼院区。
On the same day he was taken by his family to the Zhong Lou District of Huangshi Hospital.
在市中医医院，他被告知需要去黄石市中心医院检查。
At the city's TCM hospital, he was told he needed to go to the central hospital in Huangshi.
申波又赶到中心医院。
Shenbo rushed to the central hospital again.
在那里他验了血，拍了CT，检查结果显示为“毛玻璃状白肺”。
There he tested his blood and took a CT scan, which turned out to be a "plexiglass white lung."
中心医院的医生告诉他“原先属于哪个医院还是去哪个医院”，让他回到黄石市中医医院观察。
The doctor at the central hospital told him "which hospital he belonged to or which hospital to go to" and asked him to return to Huang Shi Hospital for observation.
当时已是23日晚，黄石市中医医院24日早晨将他收治隔离。
It was the night of the 23rd, Huangshi City Chinese Medicine Hospital on the morning of 24 he was placed in isolation.
1月25日申波又被120救护车转移到了中医医院的团城山院区（黄石市传染病医院）治疗。
On 25 January, Shen Bo was transferred by 120 ambulances to the Tongcheng Mountain Hospital (Huangshi City Infectious Diseases Hospital) for treatment.

"It was scary then. The nurses and doctors we saw were all well armed and could only see a pair of eyes.
”申波回忆。
"Shen Bo recalls.

"There were not many patients and the rest of the hospital was functioning normally," he said.
”申波记得自己大概是黄石全市的第三十多号确诊病例。
"Shenbo remembered that he was probably the thirtieth confirmed case of Yellowstone.
进入传染病医院后，申波就没再见过外面的世界，他说自己感觉“有点痛苦”。
After entering the infectious disease hospital, Shenbo did not see the outside world, he said he felt "a bit painful."
在隔离病房，生理和心理上都很难受。
In the isolation ward, both physical and psychological are very difficult.
每天除了强迫自己灌下三大杯白开水，基本吃不下任何东西。
You can hardly eat anything except force yourself to drink three large glasses of plain water every day.
申波回忆，后来自己的情况非常严重，最高时烧到了40度。
Shen Bo recalled that his own situation was very serious, the highest time burned to 40 degrees.
住了四天之后，血液检查结果显示他恢复得不太好，但那时候已经走不动路了，是被护士用轮椅推着去做CT的。
After four days, blood tests showed that he was not doing very well, but by that time he was no longer able to walk and had been wheeled to a CT scan by a nurse.
检查完后直接被推进了ICU病房。
After the examination was directly pushed into the ICU ward.
在ICU，呼吸机、心电监测全部都上了。
In the ICU, the ventilator and ECG monitor are all on board.
申波说，当时他人虽然清醒，但完全不能动，只能躺在病床上。
Shen said he was awake but completely unable to move and was confined to his bed.
在ICU的3天是最危险的时候，医院每天给他打针、吸氧，护士不停给他降体温。
During the three most dangerous days of the ICU, the hospital gave him injections and oxygen every day, and the nurse kept him warm.
申波告诉记者，医护人员的护目镜上全部是水珠，什么也看不见，抽血或者打针都是凭手感。
Shenbo told reporters that the medical personnel's goggles are all beads of water, nothing can be seen, blood or injection is by hand.
“我身高一米九，体重二百多斤，护士们照顾我真的很不容易。
"I'm five feet nine and weigh two hundred pounds, and it's really not easy for the nurses to take care of me.
”护士正在工作申波觉得自己既然确诊了就要好好配合治疗。
"The nurse was at work and Shenbo felt she needed to be well treated now that she had been diagnosed.
“阎王爷要收我就让他收，不收我就好好活着。
"Yama Wang Ye want to accept me let him accept, do not accept me to live well.
”谈起当时的心态，他认为自己还是很乐观的。
He thought he was optimistic about his state of mind at the time.
与家里人的通话中，申波怕父母和女儿担心，每次都说自己身体好多了，烧已经退了。
During the conversation with his family, Shen Bo was afraid of his parents and daughter. He said that he was much better and that the fever had receded.
“每天上午打个电话，因为到了下午又开始发烧，没有力气说话。
'Call me every morning, for in the afternoon I have a fever again and have no energy to speak.
”ICU病区有四个病房，每个病房内有四张床。
The ICU has four wards, each with four beds.
申波回忆，同病房的另外三位新冠肺炎重症病人，一位气管被切开，瞳孔放大。

一位老爷爷“出气进气差不多，有一下没一下”，还有一位老阿姨隔几分钟就要叫一嗓子。
An old grandfather "out of breath almost, there is not a moment," and an old aunt every few minutes to call a voice.
护士问申波，不感到害怕吗？“我说不怕，因为相信护士和医生会照顾好我。
The nurse asked Shen Bo, wasn't she scared? I said I wasn't afraid because I trusted the nurse and the doctor to take care of me.
”乐观积极感动病友在护士们的悉心照顾下，凭借着良好的心态，申波的病情逐渐好转。
"Optimistic positive moved in the nurses under the good care, relying on a good state of mind, Shenbo's condition gradually improved.
2月2日，他被从ICU转至8楼病房继续接受隔离治疗，在这里他一待就是13天。
On 2 February, he was transferred from the ICU to the eighth floor ward for continued isolation treatment, where he remained for 13 days.
此时的医院已经把其他病人全部转移，成为黄石首个治疗重症新冠肺炎患者的医院。
By this time the hospital had transferred all the other patients to become Huang Shi the first hospital to treat patients with severe new crown pneumonia.
“医护人员依旧全副武装，当时病人已经很多了，每个病房本来有三个床位，现在都被加了一到两张床。
"The paramedics were still heavily armed and there were already a lot of patients, three beds in each ward, and now one or two beds.
4小时一次轮班，每班3个护士负责30多位病人。
Shift shifts of 4 hours, each shift 3 nurses responsible for more than 30 patients.
看到有的小护士还没有氧气瓶高，要把氧气瓶搬来搬去，我真的很想上去帮她们。
Seeing that some nurses were not as tall as oxygen cylinders, I really wanted to go up and help them.
”申波说。
'he said.
从病房的窗户向外望去，申波发现自己所在的病区已经全部被封锁，唯一的出入口还有特警把守。
Looking out of the ward window, Shen Bo found that his area had been completely sealed off, with the only entrance and exit guarded by special police.
“出去要拿医院的通行证明，进来的只有救护车和病人。
"Get out and get a pass from the hospital. Ambulances and patients are the only ones in.
”“三点多会醒来，五点多再入睡，六点多再醒来。

”在八楼的隔离病房里，申波常常难以入睡，但他尽力不让自己的心态走下坡路。
In the eighth floor isolation ward, Shen Bo often has trouble falling asleep, but he tries not to let his mind go downhill.
从护士那里申波了解到，同一层楼的病友中，有位年轻人几乎每两分钟就会因各种情况叫来护士，说自己呼吸困难、喝水难以下咽、咳痰咳不出来，或者喘不过气。
Shen Bo learned from a nurse that a young man on the same floor called in nurses almost every two minutes for various reasons, saying he had difficulty breathing, drinking water, coughing up phlegm, or getting short of breath.
他不停地问护士自己是不是活不长了。
He kept asking the nurse if she would not live long.
申波在病友群里@他，告诉他如果感到难受可以给自己打电话。
Shen Bo in the group @ him, told him if he felt uncomfortable can call himself.
“结果他真的打电话来了，两点半打，四点半也打。
"He did call back, half past two and half past four.

"I think the combination of Chinese and Western medicine is more effective.
”家人给申波送来了红枣和小米，他每天还会用自己的焖烧杯煮粥。

“医院里的一日三餐也很好，水果、牛奶、糕点都有，真的很感谢政府和医护人员对我们的关心和照顾。
"The three meals a day in the hospital are also very good. Fruits, milk and cakes are all there. I really appreciate the care and attention from the government and the medical staff.

"Call me when you need plasma from a Type A healer." On Feb. 15, which coincides with Nana's 14th birthday, Shenbo said he jumped "excitedly" when she was discharged from the hospital.
