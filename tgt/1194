提前启动、提前统筹，就能节省很多时间，时间就是生命文 | 胡雯疫情爆发后，国内医疗资源迅速告急，防护服、口罩等关键物资缺口巨大，众多企业、NGO和个人第一时间开启全球大采购和捐赠，但却遭遇重重困难。
When Hwen's outbreak, China's medical resources quickly ran out of steam. There was a huge gap in vital supplies such as protective clothing and masks. Companies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and individuals began buying and donating internationally for the first time.
一连串问题摆在眼前：善款从哪里来？什么样的物资符合标准？从哪里采购、如何支付，怎样清关，如何安排物流、怎样走完“最后一公里”抵达医院。
A series of questions arise: where do the donations come from, what goods meet the criteria, where to buy, how to pay, how to clear customs, how to organize logistics, and how to get to the hospital after the "last mile."
每一个环节都错综复杂，充满考验。
Every link is intricate and full of trials.
绝大多数捐赠者都没有这方面的经验，但救援刻不容缓，必须边学边干。
The vast majority of donors have no experience in this area, but assistance is urgent and must be done while learning.
期间涌现出许多感人案例，其中一家总部位于上海的大型民营企业表现出色。
There have been many moving cases, including a Shanghai-based large private-sector company that has done well.
从1月25日至1月30日，这家企业从全球各地采购医疗口罩超33万个，防护服超过27万件，并独立出资或筹款将物资运往疫区，此时正是武汉医疗物资紧缺的高峰期。
From January 25 to January 30, the company procured more than 330,000 medical masks and 270,000 protective clothing from around the world, and independently funded or raised funds to transport supplies to affected areas, at a time when Wuhan was experiencing a peak in shortages of medical supplies.
截至2月9日零时，这家企业已在全球近20个国家采购口罩80万个，防护服42万件，总计122万件医疗物资，均已成功运抵疫情防控一线。
As of 0 p.m. Feb. 9, the company had procured 800,000 masks and 420,000 protective clothing and 1.22 million medical supplies in nearly 20 countries worldwide, all of which had been successfully delivered to the frontline of epidemic prevention and control.
近日，笔者独家采访了这家企业医药、医疗器械、董事办、战略、公共事务、外事、财务、行政等部门的十余位当事人，他们在采购、支付、物流清关、协调与认证等方面统筹安排、各司其职，高效完成了这次国际化救援。
In recent days, the author has interviewed a dozen or so parties in the fields of medicine, medical equipment, director's office, strategy, public affairs, foreign affairs, finance and administration of this enterprise.
为了叙述方便，我们取“上海民营企业”的英文首字母缩写，将这家企业称为SHPC。
For convenience of narration, we take the acronym "Shanghai Private Enterprise" and call it SHPC.
周末扫货德国，唤醒休眠的物流2020年1月24日，除夕夜，SHPC紧急成立全球医疗物资调拨工作小组，并利用其全球化业务网络，筹建覆盖日本、印度、英国、德国、西班牙、葡萄牙等近20个国家的采购网络。
Weekend Sweeper Germany, Wake Up Sleeping Logistics On January 24, 2020, SHPC set up a global working group on the allocation of medical supplies and used its global business network to set up procurement networks covering nearly 20 countries including Japan, India, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain and Portugal.
SHPC在1月22日、23日感知到问题严重，23日凌晨1点，公司领导决定当天中午召开疫情复盘及影响预判会，参会者来自全球各地。
SHPC in January 22, 23, the awareness of the serious problem, 23 1 a.m., the company's leadership decided to convene that noon epidemic and impact of the pre-conference, participants from all over the world.
紧接着，所有董事召开疫情实时报告和应对策略会。
Immediately thereafter, all directors convene real-time outbreak reporting and response strategies.
此时，全国范围内已经开始实时播报疫情感染人数，很多私下渠道也开始预警疫情的严重性。
By this time, the number of people infected with the epidemic had begun to be broadcast nationwide in real time, and many private sources had begun to warn of the severity of the outbreak.
1月24日，除夕，SHPC召开全球各地区紧急物资搜集及采购的工作会议，当晚，启动全球物资采购。
On January 24th, New Year's Eve, SHPC held a workshop on emergency materials collection and procurement in all regions of the world.
此时所有参与者都感到千头万绪，有的人抱着产品目录打手机，有的人问相关行企业的朋友，还有的就通过自己投资的医疗企业问询，有了突破，再打电话给药厂的分销商。
At this point, all the participants felt in a sea of thoughts. Some made cell phone calls with catalogues, others with friends in related industries, and still others with queries from healthcare companies that they had invested in, and made breakthroughs and telephoned drug distributors.
德国行动小组效率最高，第一时间找到供货商ASATEX公司，锁定批5万套type5+6的防护服，共14吨货物，1000箱。
The German Action Team was the most efficient and immediately located the supplier, ASATEX, for the shipment of 50,000 suits of type 5 + 6, consisting of 14 tons of cargo and 1,000 boxes.
这是个很大的突破，货量很大怕别人抢，所以直接下了订单，不走分期付款流程，直接打款。
This is a big breakthrough, the volume of goods are very afraid of others to seize, so directly placed an order, do not follow the installment process, direct payments.
因为这些货分散在德国几个地方，德国小组要求供货商马上将货物全部集中到生产商的定点仓库。
As the goods were spread over several locations in Germany, the German team requested that the suppliers immediately centralize the goods in the manufacturer's designated warehouses.
但这天是周六，德国的卡车周末都不能上路，货物司机都在家休息。
But it was Saturday, and German trucks were off the road for the weekend, with freight drivers resting at home.
德国小组只能去跟物流公司协调，找了家货运代理公司，承诺他们支付加班费，然后马不停蹄又跟德国政府运输部门提交绿色申请，最后，货代公司才勉强答应将货物从仓库运到机场，紧赶慢赶，用了四个小时到达机场通关处，但进了海关才发现德国清关窗口周末关闭。
The German team had to co-ordinate with the logistics company, approached a freight forwarder, promised them overtime payment and then grudgingly submitted a green application to the German government's transport department. Finally, the freight forwarder grudgingly agreed to transport the goods from the warehouse to the airport.
小组成员到处找办法：通过国内外交系统做沟通，协调中国驻德使馆发出照会，出具绿色通关函，让海关周末单独开辟窗口，给捐赠物资开快速通关权限，甚至让浦东海关的领导直接跟法兰克福海关打招呼，各种法子都使了。
The members of the group looked for ways to communicate through the domestic diplomatic system, coordinate notes from Chinese embassies in Germany, issue green clearance letters, open separate windows for customs at weekends, grant fast clearance authority for donated goods, and even ask the Pudong customs leadership to say hello directly to the Frankfurt Customs Service.
其中一位小组成员就一直坐在德国海关盯着……后来经过国内的沟通，总算顺利通关。
One of the team members has been sitting at the German customs staring... and then through domestic communication, finally smooth customs clearance.
接下来的难题是找不到装卸工人，他们周末也不上班。
The next problem is finding no loaders, and they don't go to work on weekends.
小组与法兰克福的海关沟通，让当地政府下批文同意德国工人起来干活，终于将物资装上飞机。
The team contacted the Frankfurt customs office and asked the local government to approve the German workers to get up to work and finally load the goods onto the plane.
装卸工人中有一位德国小伙子，脸上有个中文的“虎”字，他母亲是中国人，他干起活儿来格外卖力，还帮助协调装卸工人，起了很大作用。
One of the stevedores, a young German, had a Chinese tiger on his face, and his mother, a Chinese, worked very hard and helped coordinate the loaders.
紧接着又遇到一个麻烦：根据国内要求，货物必须用中国的托盘包装，结果14吨货物又拆开重新包装一次，从1月25日下午2点忙到晚上9点，结果没赶上1月26日中午的汉莎货机。
Then came another problem: according to domestic requirements, the goods had to be packed in Chinese pallets, and as a result, 14 tons of goods were opened and repacked again, from 2 p.m. to 9 p.m. on 25 January, and missed the Lufthansa cargo plane at noon on 26 January.
德国小组跟上海总部汇报，说最早只能周一（1月27日）飞，结果被领导一口否决。
The German team reported to its headquarters in Shanghai that it could fly as early as Monday, January 27, and was vetoed by the leader.
SHPC董事长和CEO给德国方面的要求是：“哪怕私人飞机运回来都可以！”但是也找不到任何私人飞机。
The request of the chairman and CEO of SHPC to the German side was that "even a private jet could be brought back!" But no private jet could be found.
这期间SHPC做了很多努力，包括国内的东航、南航、国航也都联系了，原本国航有一班飞机1月26日晚上能飞，但是没有仓位，货装满了，多次沟通也没办法，最后只能敲定汉莎航空1月27日第一班货机（LH8404航班），早上8点从德国法拉克福机场起飞。
During this period, SHPC made a lot of efforts, including China Eastern Airlines, China Airlines, Air China has been able to fly on the night of January 26, but there are no seats, full of goods, many communication can not be finalized, Lufthansa January 27 cargo plane (LH8404), 8 a.m. take-off from the German airport of Farakofo.
浦东清关，速度快得难以想象1月28日凌晨1点45分，飞机降落在浦东机场，卸下5万套GB19082-2009规格的防护服。
Pudong clearance, too fast to imagine January 28 at 1.45 a.m., the aircraft landed at Pudong Airport, unloading 50,000 sets of GB 19082-2009 specifications of protective clothing.
防护服这东西不常用，五万套是什么概念？每个经销商在欧洲国家的储备，也就是300到400套。
Protective clothing is not commonly used, what is the concept of 50, 000 sets? Each dealer in Europe's reserves, that is 300 to 400 sets.
清关说起来简单，但是很多个人捐赠者这次最头痛的就是货根本进不来。
Customs clearance is easy to say, but many individual donors have the biggest headache this time around.
如果走官方渠道海外捐赠的话，需要受赠方开具证明，运单收货人需要是红十字会或慈善总会等机构；如果通过一般贸易进口到国内，就等于把东西买回来，需要正常清关，还要缴税，所以1月30日前，很多新加坡、美国的口罩就在海关外头进不来。
In the case of overseas donations through official channels, grantees need to certify that the consignee of the consignment needs to be an organization such as the Red Cross or the General Charity Association; if imported into the country through general trade, it is equivalent to buying things back, requiring normal customs clearance and paying taxes, so many Singaporean and American masks were not allowed outside customs before January 30.
如果医疗物资的有效证明不齐全，那就不仅进不来，进来了医院也不敢收，很多个人捐助者没摸清楚情况，最后焦头烂额。
If the medical evidence is incomplete, not only will it not be possible to get in, hospitals will not be able to do so, and many individual donors will end up feeling overwhelmed.
SHPC从德国采购的这批防护服是欧标的，在中国没有注册过，为了快速清关，SHPC提前联系了上海市商委，出函帮助这批货物快速清关。
The suit, which SHPC had purchased from Germany, was not registered in China. In order to clear the goods quickly, SHPC contacted the Shanghai Commission in advance and sent a letter to help clear the goods quickly.
上海海关直接用了“两步申报+提前申报”通关模式（意思是企业在获取舱单信息后，向海关作“概要申报”，飞机落地后货物就可放行）、特事特办，货物到后15分钟内完成所有清关手续。
Shanghai Customs directly used the "two-step declaration + advance declaration" customs clearance mode (meaning that after acquiring manifest information, enterprises make a "summary declaration" to the customs, the cargo can be released after landing), special office, and complete all clearance procedures within 15 minutes after the arrival of the goods.
为了提高效率，检测中心的领导和工作人员带了6套回去检测，先放行SHPC这批货物。
In order to improve efficiency, the head and staff of the testing centre took six sets back for testing and released the SHPC consignment.
按正常程序，仅海关的检测环节，就得走一个星期。
According to the normal procedure, customs only the detection link, has to walk a week.
但当事各方都知道现在是救命，是跟死神赛跑，必须想尽办法越快越好。
But the parties know that this is life-saving, that it is a race against death, and that everything must be done as soon as possible.
在飞机落地之前，SHPC还提前联系了机场地面指挥中心，因为医疗物资到了浦东机场后，指挥中心要负责把物资从飞机上卸下来，并且运到指定区域再周转。
SHPC also contacted the Ground Command Centre of the airport in advance of the landing of the aircraft, as the command centre was responsible for unloading supplies from the aircraft and rerouting them to designated areas upon arrival at Pudong airport.
1月28日凌晨3点20分，清关开始，15分钟完成手续，开始货物作业卸货，运到机场仓完成整体交接。
On 28 January, at 3.20 a.m., customs clearance began, the formalities were completed in 15 minutes, the cargo was unloaded and transported to the airport warehouse to complete the overall handover.
整个过程快得在平时无法想象。
The whole process is too fast to imagine.
清关的时候，上海市领导到了，SHPC领导到了，海关和检测中心的人也都到了。
By the time the customs were cleared, the Shanghai authorities had arrived, the leadership of SHPC had arrived, and customs and testing centers had all arrived.
目前浦东机场海关人员“7×24”小时待命，而且设了绿色通道，对疫情防控物资差不多是即到即放。
At present, customs officers at Pudong Airport are on standby for 7 x 24 hours, and a green passage has been set up.
这批货物到之前，SHPC就临时在浦东机场边上租用了一个仓库，面积大概是3000平米，做为SHPC集团全球物资调配行动的征调仓库。
Prior to the arrival of the goods, SHPC temporarily rented a warehouse on the edge of Pudong Airport, measuring approximately 3,000 square metres, to serve as a warehouse for the SHPC Group's global movement of materiel.
租好以后，一夜之间，SHPC工作人员就把货物整理、入库、出库盘点和分检流程做了出来，后来所有捐赠物资都从机场进这个仓库，再往外分发。
Once rented, over the night, the SHPC staff worked out the procedures for sorting, warehousing, stock-taking and sorting out the goods, and all the donated materials were then moved from the airport to the warehouse for onward distribution.
提前统筹，节省了很多时间，时间就是生命。
Manage ahead, save a lot of time, time is life.
16小时高速路直抵武汉1月28日物资落地上海，捐给上海的部分，市领导在机场和SHPC完成了交接，直接拉走。
The 16-hour expressway arrived in Wuhan January 28 goods landing in Shanghai, donated to Shanghai, city leaders at the airport and SHPC completed the handover, directly pull away.
其他的物资就开始全国调拨，包括江苏、浙江和安徽的很多医院都有捐赠，其中调往武汉的部分，抵达目的地最为不易。
Other supplies began to flow around the country, including donations from hospitals in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui provinces, with the most difficult to reach in Wuhan.
当时武汉的疫情已经很紧急，很多医护人员都在跟病毒“肉搏”。
Wuhan at the time of the epidemic has been very urgent, many medical personnel are in "melee" with the virus.
但通往武汉的航班没有了，高铁也停了，要是用绿皮火车运，光在铁路上就要花12小时，太慢。
But flights to Wuhan are gone, and high-speed rail stops, taking 12 hours on the railway alone, too slow.
最后SHPC决定用货车运，直接从上海走高速开过去。
Finally, SHPC decided to use the truck to transport directly from Shanghai to the highway.
SHPC从内部调了一辆厢式货车，行政部门开始征集志愿者，很快有两名司机请缨。
SHPC transferred a van from within, and the administration began collecting volunteers, soon having two drivers tassel it.
1月28日上午九点，货车从机场仓库装货、出发，两个司机轮流开，两个SHPC同事押车，因为武汉沿途已经全面管控，货车一路十几个小时不敢停车。
At 9 a.m. on January 28, the lorry loaded and left the airport warehouse. The two drivers took turns, and two SHPC colleagues escorted the van, which had been under full control for more than a decade.
当时SHPC还有一辆货车从深圳恒生医院运口罩到武汉，两部车方就约在武汉附近的一个服务区碰头，之后一起进武汉。
At that time, SHPC also had a truck from Shenzhen Heng Sheng Hospital to Wuhan, the two sides of the car will meet around a service area near Wuhan, and then together into Wuhan.
SHPC事先申请了路条，能进能出。
SHPC applied in advance, can enter and exit.
经过16个小时的车程，1月29日凌晨1点，货物运抵武汉，并在两点前将物资直接拉到武汉济和医院，其它物资捐给蔡甸区卫生健康局，以及委托武汉大学校友企业家联合会捐赠给湖北2县、武汉下辖6区。
After a 16-hour drive, the goods arrived in Wuhan at 1: 00 a.m. on January 29, and by two o'clock they were taken directly to Wuhan Ji He Hospital, other materials were donated to the Cai Den District Health Bureau, and the Wuhan University Alumni Entrepreneurs' Federation was entrusted to Hubei County and Wuhan.
完成任务之后，两位司机连夜开车返回，离开湖北后在路上找了个地方，不敢下车就在车上休息了一下，第二天回到上海，立刻隔离。
After completing their assignment, the two drivers drove back overnight, left Hubei Province, found a place on the road, did not dare to get off the bus, took a rest, returned to Shanghai the next day, and immediately isolated.
从SHPC启动全球采购，到第一批防护服运到疫区，只用了4天零2个小时。
It took only four days and two hours from the start of the global procurement by SHPC to the arrival of the first protective clothing in the affected areas.
这只是第一场战役，这些天来SHPC的国际支援一直在持续。
This is only the first battle, and international support from SHPC has continued these days.
1月28日20时20分，从印度采购的10万只霍尼韦尔N95型号口罩，也已抵达上海浦东机场。
At 2020 hours on 28 January, 100,000 Honeywell N95 masks procured from India also arrived at Pudong Airport in Shanghai.
2月1日傍晚16点40分，金鹏Y87405货运专机载着来自英国的13.52万套防护服抵达重庆江北国际机场，这批防护服将被运至武汉等疫情严重的地区。
At 16: 40 pm on Feb. 1, Jin Peng Y87405 arrived at Chongqing Northern International Airport carrying 135,200 sets of protective clothing from the United Kingdom. The suits will be transported to places with severe epidemics such as Wuhan.
此外，来自葡萄牙的1万多只口罩和来自日本的1900多件防护服、900多个口罩等物资，通过“人肉”托运、肩背手提也已运抵上海，正在向疫区转运……1月29日，SHPC董事长在微信群留言，“灾难无情，人间有爱；责任当头，共克时艰。
In addition, more than 10,000 respirators from Portugal and more than 1,900 protective clothing and more than 900 face masks from Japan have also arrived in Shanghai through "human flesh" and hand-held shoulder-to-back hand-held equipment.
”号召大家形成合力，很快有群内企业响应，一批又一批的物资承载着他们的爱心，不断抵达“抗疫”前线。
"Call on everyone to form a joint force, soon there was a group of enterprises responded, a batch after batch of goods bearing their love, constantly arrived at the" anti-epidemic "front.
民间的力量在采访过程中，有人对笔者说，“接到任务时一团乱麻，不知道从何处着手，只看到各种消息在无数个群里飞”；“一边看着每天感染人数越来越多，一边对采购物资完全不懂，什么样的口罩是适用的，物资符合什么标准，物流配送应该怎么走……都没干过，真是心急如焚”；“当时两眼一抹黑，除夕夜里到处求别人”，“在鞭炮声中打了无数电话，找了各种办法”。
The power of non-governmental organizations in the interview process, someone told the author, "received the task in a mess, do not know where to start, see all kinds of information flying in groups"; "while watching more and more people infected every day, what kind of masks are applicable, what kind of materials meet, how to walk.
有人建了无数个群，打了无数个电话，穿着安全服在仓库看货、排货、排航班，从初一开始不眠不休、每天工作20个小时。
Some people built countless groups, made countless phone calls, dressed in safety clothing in the warehouse to see goods, cargo, platoon flights, from the beginning of the beginning of a sleepless, daily work 20 hours.
有人连着好些天，紧张得饭都吃不下，因为不同国家、地区的医疗物资标准、名称和语言都不同，生怕数量、物资状态、物流通关弄错了，最后到不了国内、上不了前线，自己成为罪人。
There were people who were too nervous to eat for days at a stretch, because the standards, names and languages of medical materials differed from country to country and region to region.
随着救援进程，有人从彻头彻尾的门外汉，变成了会看运单、装箱单、商业发票的熟手，甚至学会自己做装箱单，看懂了药签（HWAB）、追踪航班信息……但他们都向笔者强调，在此次全球医疗物资调拨中，得到了各国海关、各国外交系统、国家各部委以及上海市的关心和帮助；得到了各大航空公司、物流公司以及友好企业的支持；同时也有许多爱心人士主动联系SHPC，希望为疫情防治提供物资筹措、货运仓储、医疗保健等方面的帮助。
With the rescue process, some people have changed from being strictly laymen to being familiar with shipping documents, packing lists, commercial invoices, and even learning to make their own packing lists, reading medical checklists and tracking flight information.
这就是民间的力量、社会的力量。
This is the strength of the people, the strength of society.
