本报记者 陈婷 张家振 武汉报道距离2019年12月31日武汉市卫健委首次公告发现不明肺炎病例以来，截至2020年1月22日，此次疫情已过去整整22天。
This reporter Chen Ting Zhang Jia Zhen Wuhan reported that on December 31, 2019 Wuhan City Health Commission first announced the discovery of unknown pneumonia cases, as of January 22, 2020, the epidemic has been fully 22 days.
今年39岁的张琴（化名），是新型冠状病毒感染肺炎的出院患者之一。
Zhang Qin, 39 years old (alias), is one of the patients discharged from the hospital with a new coronavirus pneumonia.
1月22日，张琴就要和丈夫余东（化名）回到武汉新洲乡下，去与自己的父母及孩子团聚，这同时也是自张琴患病以来，夫妻二人第一次见到父母和孩子。
Zhang and her husband, Yu Dong (not their real name), were to return to Wuhan Xinzhou countryside on January 22 to reunite with their parents and children, the first time the couple has seen their parents and children since Zhang became ill.
此前，《中国经营报》记者曾与收治于武汉市金银潭医院（武汉市医疗救治中心）的肺炎患者及家属进行对话。
Previously, the China Business Daily had spoken with patients and family members admitted to the Jintan Hospital in Wuhan, the Wuhan medical treatment center.
1月21日，张琴已出院9天，记者再度联系采访了全程在隔离病房陪护她的余东。
January 21, Zhang Qin has been discharged from the hospital for nine days, the reporter again contacted the isolation ward to accompany her Yu Dong.
“几乎崩溃”2019年12月21日，在武汉市华南海鲜市场打工的张琴开始出现咳嗽、感冒及低烧症状。
"Almost collapsed" December 21, 2019, in Wuhan, South China seafood market work Zhang Qin began to cough, cold and low fever symptoms.
起初，张琴不以为意，只在社区诊所进行打针治疗。
At first, Zhang did not agree, only in the community clinic for injection treatment.
四天之后，仍未见好转，便于2019年12月24日到湖北省中西医结合医院（湖北省新华医院）住院，并进行了肺部CT等检查。
Four days later, it still did not improve, and on December 24, 2019, he went to the Hubei Province Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Center (Xinhua Hospital in Hubei Province) and underwent pulmonary CT and other examinations.
然而，在湖北省中西医结合医院进行一天半时间的治疗后，张琴的病情却有加重趋势，开始出现不太能走路、一走路就出现呼吸困难、气喘的症状，也不太有胃口，吃不下东西。
However, after a one-and-a-half-day treatment in the Hubei Province Chinese and Western Medical Association Hospital, Zhang's condition showed a tendency of aggravation, beginning to show symptoms of difficulty in walking, shortness of breath, wheezing and lack of appetite.
余东意识到情况不对劲，随即要求进行转院。
Realizing that something was amiss, Yu asked for a transfer.
2019年12月26日晚上，张琴和余东就来到华中科技大学同济医学院附属同济医院（以下简称“同济医院”）挂急诊并住院。
On the evening of December 26, 2019, Zhang Qin and Yu Dong came to Tongji Hospital (Tongji Hospital) attached to Tongji Medical School of Huazhong University of Science and Technology for emergency treatment and hospitalization.
余东回忆道，刚进同济医院时，医生拿着张琴在湖北省中西医结合医院拍的肺部CT片子说：“这病是病毒性肺炎，很严重。
"This is viral pneumonia, very serious," Yu recalled, referring to a CT scan of the lung taken by doctors at the Tongji Hospital in Hubei Province with Zhang Qin.
”听到这句话的余东，“几乎崩溃了”。
"I almost broke down," he said.
余东向记者提供的张琴肺部CT拍片与此同时，张琴开始了一系列的检查，包括一项名为“病原微生物NGS检测”的院外检查、CT、B超以及每天进行抽血。
At the same time, Zhang began a series of examinations, including an out-of-hospital examination called "NGS test for pathogenic microorganisms," CT, B-ultrasonography and daily blood sampling.
在此期间，患病的张琴用上了心电图、呼吸机和制氧机，并且在一天之内会出现两次高烧，白天和晚上各发烧一次。
During that time, Zhang used an electrocardiogram (ECG), a respirator and an oxygen machine, and had a high fever twice a day, one day and one night.
余东说，张琴在发烧之前会先感觉到冷、身体发抖，上身开始发烫逐渐蔓延至下身，最高时发烧至40摄氏度。
Mr. Yu said Zhang felt cold and shivering before he developed a fever, which spread to the lower part of his body, reaching a fever of up to 40 degrees Celsius.
这段时间里，张琴服用的药物种类主要有抗病毒和球蛋白。
During this time, Zhang Qin took the main types of drugs are anti-viral and globulin.
面对妻子患病后不能完全自理，余东也开始了他的细心照顾。
Faced with his wife's illness can not be completely self-care, Yu Tung also began his meticulous care.
除了每天陪伴着张琴度过输液、抽血和检查的时光，余东还给张琴的一日三餐进行喂食，隔壁病房病情比较严重的患者则是插着胃管打营养食。
In addition to accompanying Zhang Qin every day through the infusion, blood and check-up time, Yu Dong also Zhang Qin feeding three meals a day, the more serious patients in the next ward is inserted into the stomach tube to hit nutritional food.
张琴胃口不好时，喝着流食的她喝了几口就喝不下，造成了一段时间的便秘。
Zhang Qin appetite is not good, drink a few mouthful she can not drink, resulting in a period of constipation.
余东说，张琴后期胃口变好、进食正常后，消化功能也就逐渐恢复正常了。
Yu said that Zhang Qin's appetite became better after eating normal, digestive function will gradually return to normal.
由于病房没有多余的床位，余东晚上便在折叠椅上短暂休息。
Since there were no extra beds in the ward, Yu took a short rest on the folding chair at night.
就这样几天时间过去，张琴在2019年12月29日晚上终于没有出现发烧，在余东眼里，这是张琴病情好转的迹象。
After a few days, Zhang Qin finally did not have a fever on the night of December 29, 2019. In Yu Dong's eyes, it was a sign that Zhang was getting better.
余东向医生询问：“这是否意味着病情得到控制？”医生告诉余东：“不一定。
"Does this mean the condition is under control?" Yu Dong was told by the doctor.
”虽然医生没有给出确切的说辞，但这一次，余东感觉“松了一口气”。
Although the doctor didn't give a precise answer, this time Yu felt "relieved."
“至少没有像刚来时说得那么严重了。
At least not as seriously as when I first came.
”他心里暗自念叨。
"he said to himself.
“没有时间考虑自己”2019年12月30日这天，有医务人员询问余东及张琴在哪儿上班，余东称是在华南海鲜市场工作。
"I don't have time to think about myself." On December 30, 2019, medical staff asked Yu Dong and Zhang Qin where they work.
医务人员告诉他，华南海鲜市场的发病率较高。
Medical staff told him that there was a high incidence in the South China seafood market.
隔日，张琴被转至另一间病房单独隔离，下午4时左右便送至武汉市金银潭医院。
The next day, Zhang Qin was transferred to another ward to be isolated. At about 4 pm, he was taken to the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital in Wuhan.
这一次，医院方要求家属与患者进行隔离。
This time, the hospital asked the family to be separated from the patient.
余东向医务人员表示，张琴现在仍不能完全自理，需要有人照顾，但南四楼（住院楼）只有两三个护士，根本忙不过来。
Yu told medical staff that Zhang was still unable to take care of himself and needed to be cared for, but there were only two or three nurses on the fourth floor.
“那时候只考虑到她需要有人照顾，根本就没时间考虑自己是否会感染。
"It was a time when there was no time to think about whether she would get infected, just because she needed someone to take care of her.
”最终，余东留了下来，与张琴一同隔离在四楼病房中。
"Yu finally stayed, isolated with Zhang Qin in the fourth floor ward.
余东介绍，南四楼大约有14间病房，分为3人房和5人房，刚开始住院时病房里空空如也，缺少生活用品。
There were about 14 wards on the fourth floor, divided into three-person rooms and five-person rooms.
医务人员则告诉余东，该楼刚装修完不长时间。
Medical staff told Yu Dong that the building had just been renovated for a short time.
余东向记者提供的武汉市金银潭医院住院部南四楼环境照片2020年1月1日，余东向医院交了300元的伙食费，医务人员并无确切说明是多长时间的开销费用。
On January 1, 2020, Yu Dong paid the hospital 300 yuan for food. The medical staff did not specify how long the expenses would be incurred.
余东回忆道，刚到医院时，前两天的伙食很差，早上只有一勺稀饭和一个包子，午晚餐的盒饭也“不见油水”，吃的有莴苣、包心菜、西红柿炒鸡蛋、黄瓜等。
When he first arrived at the hospital, the food was poor for the first two days, with only a spoonful of porridge and a steamed bun in the morning.
待到1月3日左右，医院伙食开始有了改善，早上除了稀饭还有馒头、花卷，中午的盒饭还有酸奶、萝卜炖排骨等饭菜。
Around January 3, hospital meals began to improve, except for porridge and steamed bread, rolls, lunch boxes of rice, yogurt and radish stew ribs.
与此同时，张琴的胃口也开始好了起来，进食也逐步正常。
At the same time, Zhang Qin's appetite also began to improve, eating gradually normal.
由于与张琴一起被隔离，余东所需的日常用品都托朋友买了送到医院，偶尔由楼下保安转接到其所在楼层，或托隔壁床前来送东西的家属捎带一些。
Isolated with Zhang, Yu's daily needs are bought by friends and sent to the hospital, occasionally transferred from the security guard downstairs to his floor, or brought with him to the next bed.
没有了折叠椅的余东，托朋友买了一张折叠床，还购置了一些口罩。
Without folding chairs Yu Dong entrusted friends to buy a folding bed, but also bought some masks.
在武汉市金银潭医院里，医生每天都会隔着病房玻璃查看患者的体温、心电图和其他检查结果等各项数据。
At the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital in Wuhan, doctors check the patient's temperature, electrocardiogram and other results through the glass in the ward every day.
张琴在这里的治疗以输液为主，前期的药品主要包括头孢、护胃药及护肝药等。
Zhangqin treatment here to infusion-based, the main drugs in the early period including ceftam, stomach medicine and liver care drugs.
另一方面，对于余东，医院方面并没有对其进行抽血等检查，而余东称其在陪护期间也没有出现感冒、发烧。
For Yu Dong, on the other hand, the hospital did not carry out blood tests, and Yu Dong said that he did not accompany the cold, fever.
在余东印象中，1月8日，张琴使用的输液药品开始减少，改用头孢口服液；1月10日，张琴先后摘下了呼吸机和制氧机，医生告诉她，“试着慢慢习惯自己进行呼吸”，在做了肺部CT复查、10～14天内没有出现发烧、其他指标均达标后，张琴被转入观察病房；1月12日早上，医务人员拿着出院单告诉余东和张琴“可以出院了”，并开出一些补肾补肝的药品，告诉他们一个月后回医院复查。
On January 8, Zhang took off the ventilator and the oxygen machine first. On January 10, Zhang Qin took off the ventilator and the oxygen machine. The doctor told her, "Try to get used to breathing by yourself."
对孩子隐瞒病情出院后，张琴和余东收到武汉市金银潭医院退还入院时缴纳的共计4000元住院费。
After concealing his condition from hospital, Zhang Qin and Yu Dong received from Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital a total hospital admission fee of 4000 yuan.
余东估算了一下，加上在此前两个医院的治疗开销（在湖北省中西医结合医院花费4000元，在同济医院花费33000元）共花费约4万元，而在张琴开始住院后，余东和张琴便失去经济收入来源，靠的是此前一些积蓄在治病。
Yu estimated the cost of treatment at the two hospitals -- 4,000 yuan in Hubei province combined with 33,000 yuan in Tongji hospital -- and 40,000 yuan. After Zhang started hospitalizing, Yu and Zhang lost their source of income and relied on their previous savings to treat the disease.
张琴生病前，余东和张琴都在华南海鲜市场打工，每个人月工资为4000元。
Before his illness, Yu Dong and Zhang Qin worked in the seafood market in southern China, each earning 4000 yuan a month.
余东并没有透露其打工档口售卖的是什么货物，他说：“之前在那儿打工就不好说人家了。
Mr. Yu didn't disclose what goods his laborer was selling, saying: 'It's hard to say people used to work there.
”目前，余东和张琴均为停止工作状态，张琴仍在家中进行休养，时常锻炼身体。
At present, Yu Dong and Zhang Qin are in a state of cessation of work, Zhang Qin is still recuperating at home, often physical exercise.
刚开始出院时，张琴下床走路时小腿经常抽筋、酸痛，现在已恢复正常。
Just began to leave the hospital, Zhang Qin left bed when the leg often cramps, sore, now has returned to normal.
在这段时间里，余东对亲戚朋友欲前来看望的好意纷纷婉拒，说“现在是敏感时期”，只与家人每天保持通话。
During this time, Yu declined to be visited by relatives and friends, saying it was "a sensitive time" and talking only to his family every day.
1月21日，余东在接受本报记者采访时表示，张琴现在的身体状况恢复正常，没有出现呼吸、进食方面的困难。
January 21, Yu Dong in an interview with our reporter, Zhang Qin is now back to normal health, there are no breathing, eating difficulties.
张琴出院后，武汉市金银潭医院的医务人员对其进行了一次电话回访，询问恢复情况。
After Zhang Qin was discharged from hospital, the medical staff of the gold and silver pool hospital in Wuhan made a call back to him to inquire about the recovery.
1月22日，余东和张琴就要回到武汉新洲老家，去与父母和孩子相聚，这同时也是自张琴患病以来，夫妻二人第一次见到父母和孩子。
On January 22, Yu Dong and Zhang Qin will return to their hometown in Wuhan, China, to spend time with their parents and children, the first time since Zhang Qin became ill.
余东告诉记者，孩子将于明年参加高考，出于这方面考虑，余东和张琴并没有将过去一个月发生的事情详细地告诉孩子，只向他透露张琴发烧了，但不敢说明病情和疾病性质。
Yu told reporters that the children will take the college entrance examination next year, for this reason, Yu Dong and Zhang Qin did not tell the children in detail what happened in the past month.
只不过，在张琴患病期间，孩子看到家中着急的外公外婆，还是觉察出了些许不正常。
Only, in the course of Zhang Qin's illness, the child saw the anxious grandparents at home, or feel a little abnormal.
直至近期张琴出院，与孩子和家人保持通话后，孩子才渐渐放下心来，但还是担心身在武汉的余东和张琴再次感染。
Only after Zhang Qin was recently released from hospital and kept in touch with his children and family, the child gradually relaxed, but still worried about being in Wuhan Yu Dong and Zhang Qin re-infection.
“乡下的空气好一些。
"The country air is better.
”如今，对家人的思念和对新鲜空气的渴望已构成了余东和张琴对家的向往。
The yearning for family and the desire for fresh air now make up Yu Dong and Zhang Qin's yearning for home.
“孩子在新洲上高中，初六就要去上学了，我们也预计初八再回城，看看年后的情况。
"The children in Xinzhou high school, six days to go to school, we also expect to return to the city on the eighth day of the year to see the situation.
”余东说道。
'he said.
