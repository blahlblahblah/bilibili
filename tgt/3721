女子在集中隔离点要喝矿泉水据北京日报，无独有偶，昨天，一名女子在集中隔离点坚持要喝矿泉水的视频引发舆论关注。
A woman insisted on drinking mineral water at a central quarantine site yesterday, according to Beijing Daily.
据网友爆料，视频中的女子是从意大利返回的留学生，在上海浦东被隔离期间，对提供的白开水不满，坚持要喝矿泉水。
According to netizens, the women in the video are returning from Italy, during the isolation of Shanghai Pudong, dissatisfied with the provision of boiled water, insisted on drinking mineral water.
Play据微博@中国警察网发布的这段视频显示，一名隔离区的女子因为喝水问题与工作人员发生争执，还想冲卡闯出去，随后警察赶来处理纠纷。
According to the video released by Weibo @ China Police Network, a woman in the area of separation came to handle the dispute after she had an argument with a staff member and wanted to punch out.
视频中，一位穿着特警字样防护服的男子正在询问一位年轻女子：“刚才是否要冲卡闯出去？”女子对此予以否认。
In the video, a man wearing a special police protective clothing is asking a young woman: "Did you just punch out?" The woman denied.
随后特警对女子提出口头警告说：“这里不是宾馆，这里是隔离区……”但话还没说完，便被女子打断，该女子说：“隔离区也要保障人权吧。
"This is not a hotel, this is a quarantine area..." But before the woman finished, the woman said: "The area of separation should also safeguard human rights.
我已经三天没有喝水了。
I haven't had any water in three days.
”原来，女子表示要喝矿泉水，而且还要把快递寄到隔离区，由此与工作人员发生了争执。
A dispute arose over the woman's offer to drink mineral water and deliver the courier to the quarantine zone.
工作人员表示，隔离区有开水壶，大家都是烧开水喝的。
According to staff, there is a kettle in the area of separation, everyone is boiling water to drink.
但女子称开水里都是杂质，没有办法喝。
But the woman said the boiling water is all impurities, there is no way to drink.
视频中，特警回怼女子说：“这里不是来给你旅游的。
In the video, the special police officer said: "This is not for you to travel.
”据中国经济周刊，此前，由一位归国华人拍摄的视频引起热议。
According to China Economic Weekly, a video shot by a returning Chinese had sparked heated debate.
画面显示，拍摄者为意大利归国男子，认为机场等待区的条件简陋，等待时间过长而不满，并称“大家看看，我们欧洲回来的，待遇是这样的，让你呆一晚上”。
The picture shows the Italian man returning home, complaining of poor conditions in the airport waiting area and waiting too long, and saying, "Look, we came back from Europe and got you a night."
近期回国华人增多，机场防疫检查和疏散旅客的压力增大。
The recent increase in the number of Chinese returnees, airport vaccination screening and evacuation pressure increased.
据悉，该男子所乘坐的航班到达机场时已是11日深夜，因等待防疫检查的人员较多，机场划分了指定区域安排归国的华人。
It is reported that the man's flight arrived at the airport late on the 11th night, due to more people waiting for vaccination, the airport designated regional arrangements for the return of Chinese.
据现场一女子表示，由于当晚到达的旅客非常多，一时间无法控制，旅客需要乘坐机场大巴车，但是车载能力有限，导致机场旅客滞留。
According to a woman on the scene, due to the very large number of passengers arriving that night, the time out of control, passengers need to take the Airport bus, but limited car capacity, resulting in airport passengers.
侠客岛曾发表评论称：最近有几个境外回国人员在隔离点闹意见的事让人很生气：有的人有咳嗽症状却不配合入境检疫步骤，有的人在隔离点非矿泉水不喝闹脾气。
People who have coughed but do not cooperate with quarantine procedures, or who do not drink at quarantined non-mineral water, are angry at the recent quarantining incidents on the Isle of Chivalry.
岛叔觉得，在目前严防境外疫情输入的关键时刻，加强入境检疫是管控的重中之重，接受检疫则是每一位入境人员应该遵守的义务。
The uncle felt that at this critical time to strictly prevent the importation of foreign epidemic disease, strengthening quarantine is the most important control, quarantine is the obligation of every person entering the country.
之前，郑州郭某鹏隐瞒出境史带病毒回国，让一市十几天的努力化作泡影；美国来京确诊病例对乘务员撒谎隐瞒症状，引起民众极大的愤怒，这些教训都足够深刻！最近，国内疫情态势向好，一些人选择回国，有媒体报道英国直飞国内的机票最高甚至炒到18万一张。
Earlier, Zhengzhou Guo Mengpeng concealed the exit history of the virus returned to China, so that a city's efforts over the past 10 days turned into a bubble; the United States to Beijing confirmed cases of lying to stewards concealed symptoms, aroused great anger, these lessons are sufficiently profound!
入境管控的工作非常艰巨。
Immigration control is very difficult.
岛叔想说，医护、安保人员承受着更重的工作压力，多一份理解，多一些忍耐，共同把这步跨过去。
Shimadu would like to say that medical, security personnel bear more pressure to work, more understanding, more patience, together to take this step forward.
我们不奢求你说声谢谢，但也别制造无谓的麻烦。
We don't ask you to say thank you, but don't make trouble for nothing.
留学生要不要回国？张文宏这么说虽然有上述种种不配合防疫工作的入境人员，但是不能否认的是，大多数入境人员还是积极配合相关部门的防疫工作的。
Zhang Wenhong said that although there are all the above-mentioned people who do not cooperate with the epidemic prevention work, it can not be denied that most people still actively cooperate with the relevant departments of immunization.
据深圳特区报，3月10日下午，意大利留学生瑶瑶（化名）乘坐的飞机降落在深圳。
Yao Yao, an Italian student, landed in Shenzhen in the afternoon of March 10, according to the Shenzhen Special Administrative Region News.
此前，她在意大利已经自我隔离了20天。
She had been isolated in Italy for 20 days.
从意大利时间9日早上6时登上飞机至此，她已经在路上辗转了近30个小时，是平时的近3倍。
Since boarding the plane at 6 a.m. Italian time on the 9th, she has been tossing the road for nearly 30 hours, nearly three times the usual rate.
一路上不敢吃饭喝水、不敢摘下口罩，直至被送到隔离点才放下心来。
Dare not eat and drink water all the way, dare not take off mask, until be sent to quarantine point just relax.
回来前，瑶瑶就把能申报的途径全部都申报了一遍，回国后下飞机也是第一时间向机场工作人员报备。
Before returning, Yao Yao declared all the ways he could declare, and when he got back from the plane, he reported it to the airport staff at the first time.
目前瑶瑶在酒店集中隔离，核酸检测呈阴性。
Yao Yao is now concentrated in the hotel isolation, Nucleic acid testing negative.
瑶瑶登上返程飞机后的当天晚上，意大利宣布“封国”。
The night after Yao Yao boarded the return flight, Italy declared a "state".
据中国青年报，为协助海外华侨华人做好新冠肺炎疫情防控工作，3月16日下午（北京时间），复旦大学附属华山医院感染科主任张文宏等上海医疗专家视频连线意大利、法国、马来西亚、澳大利亚、阿联酋的侨社代表，分享新冠肺炎防控和救治经验，对海外疫情防控防治给予积极建议。
According to the China Youth Daily, in order to assist overseas Chinese in the prevention and control of the New Crown Pneumonia epidemic, Shanghai medical experts such as Zhang Wenhong, director of infection department of Fudan University affiliated with Huashan Hospital, shared their experience in prevention and treatment of New Crown Pneumonia and gave positive suggestions for overseas disease prevention and control.
对于留学生是否应该回国的问题，张文宏说：“不管回不回，你要考虑两个问题，第一疫情要多长时间？回来是不是决定再也不回去了？如果疫情要延缓半年呢，读书工作都不要了？第二如果不回来待在那里怎么办？”张文宏建议，采取有效的个人防护，这个病可以防。
"Whether you return or not, you need to consider two questions," Zhang said. "How long will the first outbreak take? Or will you decide not to go back again? If the disease is going to be delayed for half a year, you won't want to study or work?
保持社交距离，勤洗手，再加上戴口罩，这三点都采用。
Keep your social distance, wash your hands frequently, and wear a mask.
“到现在为止，我没有看到哪个人这三点做得特别好还被感染的，这个可能性很小。
"So far, I haven't seen anyone do particularly well on these three things and get infected, and that's a slim chance.
”张文宏认为，当下做好个人的防护、让自己不生病是最好的办法拒绝隔离、刻意隐瞒如何定罪？今年2月，最高法、最高检、公安部、司法部等就已发布《关于依法惩治妨害新型冠状病毒感染肺炎疫情防控违法犯罪的意见》，对上述行为的定罪处罚作出明确规定：新冠确诊病患拒绝隔离进入公共场所，以危险方法危害公共安全罪定罪处罚。
In February, the Supreme Court, the Supreme Procuratorate, the Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of Justice issued the Opinions on Punishing Unlawful Acts Against the Outbreak of the New Coronavirus Infected with Pneumonia in accordance with the Law.
最高法副院长杨万明表示，疫情发生以来，绝大多数群众能够依照法律规定，自觉配合和支持有关部门依法采取的疫情防控措施，但有的地方也出现了抗拒疫情防控措施的现象。
Yang Wanming, vice-president of the Supreme Court, said that since the outbreak of the epidemic, the vast majority of the people have been able to voluntarily cooperate with and support the disease prevention and control measures taken by the relevant departments according to law.
如已经确诊或者疑似感染新型冠状病毒的人拒不服从隔离治疗措施，或者曾经进出疫情高发地区、已出现发热等感染症状，仍刻意隐瞒甚至进入公共场所等等。
If a person who has been diagnosed or suspected to be infected with a new coronavirus refuses to comply with isolation measures, or has had access to areas with a high incidence of infection, has developed symptoms such as fever, and still deliberately conceals or even enters public places.
“上述行为不仅危害行为人自身的生命健康安全，而且危害公共卫生和公共安全，应当依法惩治。
"The above-mentioned acts not only endanger the life, health and safety of the perpetrators themselves, but also public health and public security, and should be punished according to law.
为准确适用法律，《意见》区分案件不同情况，特别是行为人的主观心态，对定罪处罚作出了明确。
In order to apply the law correctly, the Views distinguish between different circumstances of the case, in particular the subjective mentality of the perpetrator, and establish clear penalties for conviction.
”他说。
'he said.
一个是以危险方法危害公共安全罪。
One is the offence of endangering public security by dangerous means.
根据传染病防治法的规定，已经确诊的新型冠状病毒感染肺炎病人、病原携带者、疑似病人，应当接受隔离治疗。
According to the provisions of the Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, patients with pneumonia, pathogen carriers and suspected patients who have been diagnosed with this coronavirus shall receive isolated treatment.
已经确诊或者疑似病人违背法定义务，拒绝隔离治疗并进入公共场所的，显属“明知故犯”，属于希望或者放任新型冠状病毒传播，危害公共安全，对此，依法应当以以危险方法危害公共安全罪论处。
Any person who has been diagnosed or suspected of violating his legal obligations by refusing treatment in isolation and entering a public place is clearly guilty of "knowingly violating the law," and belongs to the hope or indulgence of the spread of the new coronavirus, thus endangering public security.
基于此，《意见》明确，故意传播新型冠状病毒感染肺炎病原体，具有下列两种情形之一，危害公共安全的，应当依照刑法第一百一十四条、一百一十五条的规定，以以危险方法危害公共安全罪定罪处罚：一是已经确诊的新型冠状病毒感染肺炎病人、病原携带者，拒绝隔离治疗或者隔离期未满擅自脱离隔离治疗，并进入公共场所或者公共交通工具的；二是新型冠状病毒感染肺炎疑似病人拒绝隔离治疗或者隔离期未满擅自脱离隔离治疗，并进入公共场所或者公共交通工具，造成新型冠状病毒传播的。
In accordance with the provisions of Article 114 and 115 of the Criminal Law, if a newly-diagnosed coronavirus infects a pneumonia patient or a pathogen carrier, he or she refuses to be isolated for treatment or left isolation treatment before the period of isolation and enters a public place or public transport without permission.
此外，还可以妨害传染病防治罪定罪。
In addition, it can hinder the criminalization of infectious disease prevention and control offences.
经国务院批准，国家卫生健康委员会已决定对新型冠状病毒感染肺炎采取甲类传染病的防控措施。
With the approval of the State Council, the State Council of Health has decided to take preventive and control measures against the new coronavirus-infected pneumonia.
《意见》明确，其他违反传染病防治法的规定，拒绝执行卫生防疫机构依法提出的防控措施，引起新型冠状病毒传播或者有传播严重危险的，应当依照刑法第三百三十条的规定，以妨害传染病防治罪定罪处罚。
The Opinion clearly stipulates that if any other person, in violation of the provisions of the Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, refuses to carry out the prevention and control measures prescribed by the anti-epidemic agency according to law, causing the spread of the new coronavirus or posing a serious risk of transmission.
