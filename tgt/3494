”全球逐渐加重的新冠肺炎疫情正在深度影响航空业。
The growing global outbreak of new crown pneumonia is deeply affecting the airline industry.
英国航空公司3月13日表示，其正在经历一场“生存之战”，疫情对航空业的影响“超过了9·11事件”。
British Airways said March 13 that it is experiencing a "battle of survival", the impact of the epidemic on the aviation industry "beyond the events of September 11."
据《卫报》报道，英国航空董事长写了一封题为“英国航空公司的生存”的公开信给员工，其中提到，由于美国禁止了申根区公民入境，公司将停飞大量飞机，数量前所未有，并可能裁员。
British Airways's chairman wrote an open letter to employees entitled "Survival of British Airways," citing an unprecedented number of aircraft and possible lay-offs as a result of the US ban on the entry of Schengen-zone citizens, the Guardian reported.
3月11日，美国总统特朗普宣布，从13日午夜起禁止欧洲申根区的公民飞往美国。
On March 11, US President Trump announced that citizens of the Schengen area of Europe would be banned from flying to the United States from midnight on the 13th.
虽然英国在禁令之外，但伦敦希斯罗机场有近1/4的旅客是来自申根区的中转乘客，英国航空的跨大西洋业务将会受到严重影响。
Despite the UK ban, nearly a quarter of passengers at London's Heathrow airport are transiting passengers from the Schengen area, and BA's transatlantic operations will be severely affected.
另据路透社报道，受美国禁令及全球其他国家入境管控影响，德国汉莎航空已有三分之二的飞机停飞，并将进一步削减航线。
Two-thirds of Lufthansa's aircraft are grounded in the United States ban and other controls on entry into the world, and will cut routes further, Reuters reported.
同时，汉莎航空计划取消年度股东分红，并打算向德国政府寻求援助。
Lufthansa also plans to cancel annual shareholder dividends and seek assistance from the German government.
德国汉莎航空集团旗下还拥有瑞士国际航空、奥地利航空、布鲁塞尔航空等公司，汉莎集团也已经向这些航空公司所在国家提出援助请求。
Lufthansa also owns Swiss International Airlines, Austrian Airlines and Brussels Airlines, and Lufthansa has sent requests for assistance to their home countries.
除了美国的旅行禁令，欧洲本身严重的疫情也影响了欧洲大陆内部的航班流动，财务状况不好的航空公司面临更大的生存压力。
In addition to the US travel ban, Europe's own severe epidemic has also affected intra-continental flight movements, with financially strapped airlines under greater pressure to survive.
在疫情爆发前就饱受债务困扰的挪威航空称，其距离破产仅有“数周而不是数月”。
Norwegian Airlines, which had been in debt since before the outbreak, said it was "weeks, not months" away from bankruptcy.
除非得到援助，否则挪威航空将步英国Flybe航空公司后尘。
Unless bailed out, Norwegian Airlines will follow suit.
3月5日，Flybe航空公司宣布破产，成为此次疫情中第一家倒闭的航空公司。
On March 5, Flybe was declared bankrupt, making it the first airline to fail in the epidemic.
Flybe原本就面临财务危机，疫情成为压垮它的最后一根稻草。
Flybe was already facing a financial crisis, and the outbreak was the last straw that crushed it.
航空公司的倒闭也直接影响到机场的经营。
Airline failures also have a direct impact on airport operations.
英国南安普敦机场90%的航班由Flybe运营，Flybe倒闭后，南安普敦机场不得不另寻其他航空公司提供服务。
Since Flybe, which operates 90 per cent of flights at Southampton airport, has had to turn to other airlines for services.
该机场预计，今年的旅客将减半。
The airport expects the number of passengers to halve this year.
受疫情影响，英国爱丁堡机场也要求员工开始无薪休假和减少工作时长，并有可能裁掉100个工作岗位。
Edinburgh airport has also asked employees to take unpaid leave and work fewer hours, possibly cutting 100 jobs, the report said.
大西洋彼岸，美国航空、达美航空、美联航也正在与美国政府沟通，希望获得政府的帮助渡过难关。
Across the Atlantic, American Airlines, United Airlines and United Airlines are also talking to the U.S. government to help them tide over the difficulties.
其中达美航空表示，在未来的一段时间将削减40%航线，为历史最高值；美国航空称，将削减1/3的国际航线，停止招聘，提前退役飞机。
Among them, Delta says it will cut 40% of its routes for some time to come, the highest ever, and American says it will cut international routes by a third, halt recruitment and retire aircraft early.
欧美之间的航空市场规模巨大，据国际航协（IATA）统计，2019年美国与申根地区之间共有约20万个定期航班，日均航班量约550个，客运量达4600万人次（日均约12.5万人次），旅行禁令对全球经济带来的负面影响是广泛的。
The air market between Europe and the US is huge, with roughly 200,000 scheduled flights between the US and the Schengen area in 2019, with an average daily flight capacity of about 550 flights and 46 million passengers (125,000 daily), according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA).
国际航协预测，根据2020年3月5日的疫情数据，这场危机可能会给航空业造成1130亿美元的损失，这一预测结果尚未包括美国和其他国家（以色列、科威特和西班牙）此后采取的严厉管控措施。
IATA predicts that the crisis could cost the airline industry $113 billion based on March 5, 2020, a forecast that does not include the stringent controls that the United States and other countries (Israel, Kuwait, and Spain) have taken since then.
国际航协理事长朱尼亚克建议，各国政府可以通过扩大信贷额度、降低基础设施成本、减轻税收负担等政策帮助行业脱困。
IATA Director-General Juniak suggested that governments could help lift industries out of poverty by extending credit lines, reducing infrastructure costs and reducing the tax burden.
“航空运输至关重要，如果政府未能及时施以援手，整个行业将面临因疫情引发的行业金融危机。
"Air transport is vital and if the government fails to help in a timely manner, the industry faces an industry-wide financial crisis triggered by the epidemic."
”朱尼亚克说。
