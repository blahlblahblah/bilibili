美联储祭出危机“大杀器”重启商业票据融资机制这一次，美股的反攻行情，美联储终于发挥了作用。
US Federal Reserve Sets Crisis "Killer" to Restart Commercial Paper Financing This time, the U. S. stock counter-attack, the Federal Reserve finally came into play.
昨日晚间，美国联邦储备委员会宣布，将建立商业票据融资机制（CPFF），以支持信贷流向家庭和企业。
Last night, the Federal Reserve announced it would set up a Commercial Paper Financing Facility (CPFF) to support credit flows to households and businesses.
美联储在声明中称，受疫情影响，商业票据市场近日承受“相当大的压力”，商业票据融资机制应能消除市场风险，提高企业在疫情爆发期间维持就业和投资的能力，财政部将向美联储提供100亿美元的信贷保护，这些资金将来自财政部的外汇稳定基金，除非延期，商业票据融资机制将于2021年3月17日终止。
In a statement, the Fed said the commercial-paper market had come under 'considerable pressure' in recent days to eliminate market risk and improve companies' ability to sustain jobs and investments during the outbreak. The Treasury will provide $10 billion in credit protection to the Fed from the Treasury's Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund, which expires on March 17, 2021.
据了解，商业票据融资机制将通过特殊目的工具（SPV）向美国商业票据发行人提供流动性支持，该工具将直接从合格公司购买评级为A1/P1（截至2020年3月17日）的无担保和资产抵押商业票据。
It is understood that the Commercial Paper Facility will provide liquidity support to United States commercial paper issuers through the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), which will purchase unsecured and asset-backed commercial paper rated A1 / P1 (as at 17 March 2020) directly from eligible companies.
由于新型冠状病毒爆发，企业和家庭面临更大的不确定性，商业票据市场近几天一直处于相当大的压力之下。
The commercial-paper market has come under considerable pressure in recent days as businesses and households face greater uncertainty over the new coronavirus outbreak.
通过消除合格发行人无法通过展期偿还到期商业票据债务的风险，这一机制应鼓励投资者再次在商业票据市场进行定期贷款。
By eliminating the risk that qualified issuers will not be able to repay maturing commercial paper obligations through rollover, this mechanism should encourage investors to make further term loans in the commercial paper market.
美联储于2008年10月创建了商业票据融资基金，以从公司发行人那里购买商业票据并恢复市场信心。
The Federal Reserve created the Commercial Paper Financing Fund in October 2008 to buy commercial paper from corporate issuers and restore confidence.
此后未偿还的商业票据跌破了1万亿美元，但是近年来市场的使用再次增加。
Unpaid commercial paper has since fallen below $1 trillion, but market use has increased again in recent years.
这一举措意味着，自大萧条以来，美联储首次绕过银行，直接向美国企业放贷。
The move means that, for the first time since the Great Depression, the Fed has bypassed banks and lent directly to US companies.
分析人士表示，市场之所以对此反应激烈，因为市场认为，这才是缓解市场“美元荒”的最有效措施，公司依靠商业票据市场作为满足意外资金需求的可靠短期现金来源。
Analysts said the market had reacted sharply because it believed that this was the most effective way to alleviate the "dollar shortage" in the market, which relied on the commercial paper market as a reliable source of short-term cash to meet unexpected funding needs.
而除了美联储之外，纽约联储也在积极开展救市行动。
In addition to the Fed, the New York Fed is also aggressively pursuing a rescue effort.
纽约联储昨日在美股开盘后表示，当日将进行额外的隔夜回购操作，最高5000亿美元。

就在周一，纽约联储也曾进行额外的隔夜回购操作，最高5000亿美元。
Just Monday, the New York Fed made an extra overnight buy-back of up to $500 billion.
据悉，纽约联储本周将每天通过隔夜回购操作提供一万亿美元。
The New York Fed is understood to be providing $1 trillion a day through overnight repo operations this week.
纽约联储声明称，该措施是为了“确保准备金供应充足，并支持短期美元融资市场的平稳运转”。
The New York Fed statement said the measure was intended "to ensure an adequate supply of reserves and to support the smooth functioning of short-term dollar financing markets."
美国酝酿万亿美元刺激计划启动“直升机撒钱”时代除了美联储放出大招之外，让市场更为感到兴奋的是，美国政府可能要启动“直升机撒钱”时代。
In addition to the Fed's big move in the era of "helicopter money," the brewing trillion-dollar stimulus plan in the US has added to the excitement that the US government may be about to embark on the era of helicopter drops.
据中新网，美国财政部长姆努钦周二前往国会，与参议院共和党议员讨论第三轮新冠病毒应对方案，以抵挡疫情带来的经济危机。
On Tuesday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Mnutchin went to Congress to discuss with Senate Republicans a third round of a new cap-and-virus response to stem the economic crisis.
报道称，特朗普政府想要实施一个8500亿美元的经济刺激计划。
The Trump administration wants to implement a $850 billion economic stimulus plan, the report said.
据《华盛顿邮报》报道，白宫的提议将包括向航空业提供约500亿美元的援助。
The White House proposal would include an estimated $50 billion in aid to the airline industry, The Washington Post reported.
姆努钦介绍，接下来的援助计划的细节，将包括此前批准了美联储主席鲍威尔希望使用再贴现窗口的请求；美联储的商业票据工具将支持1万亿美元的信贷市场；美国总统特朗普要求实施税收递延，总值达3000亿美元；姆努钦称，如果不采取措施，新冠肺炎将会导致失业率飙升至20%。
Details of the next aid package will include approval of a request from Federal Reserve Chairman Colin Powell to use the rediscount window, a $1 trillion credit market supported by the Federal Reserve's commercial-paper tools, President Trump's demand for a $300 billion tax deferral program, and Mr. Munuchin said failure to do so would cause unemployment to soar to 20%.
姆努钦称，可能在接下来的两周内给美国人“发支票”。
Mr Munucin said it was possible to "send checks" to Americans within the next two weeks.
他说，对美国人来说，“支票”将被视为“业务中断付款”。
For Americans, "checks" would be considered "business interruption payments," he said.
当被问及谁会收到支票时，特朗普说，大多数美国人都会，但“年收入一百万美元”的人可能不会，“希望美国人尽快拿到钱”。
When asked who will receive the check, Trump says that most Americans do, but "a million a year" may not. "I hope Americans get the money soon."
姆努钦坚持说，市场不会因为冠状病毒而关闭，即使银行设立了较短的营业时间，但也将保持开放。
The market will not be closed because of the coronavirus, he insisted, even if banks set up shorter business hours, they would remain open.
“9/11之后市场休市的唯一原因是技术被破坏，但是美国人应该知道，我们将竭尽所能，以确保美国人能够使用自己的股票、401K及其投资组合里的钱。
"The only reason the markets were closed after 9 / 11 was because of the destruction of technology, but Americans should know that we will do everything we can to make sure Americans are able to use their stocks, 401K and the money in their portfolios.
”美国“雷曼式”剧本能否奏效？美股后续或仍将巨幅震荡不过，美联储和政府接连启动各种刺激计划积极救市，甚至不惜拿出2008年金融危机时代的金融杀器，这些措施是否能够奏效，阻止美股继续下跌，则仍是未知数。
Whether the US "Lehman-style" script will work? US stocks will probably follow suit, but it remains to be seen whether the stimulus packages launched by the Federal Reserve and the government to prop up the market, even with the financial carnage of the 2008 financial crisis, will work and keep U.S. stocks from falling.
诺贝尔经济学奖获得者约瑟夫-斯蒂格利茨认为，美联储采取了激进政策行动，但却不足以帮助美国避免因冠状病毒疫情爆发引起的经济衰退。
Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel laureate in economics, said the Fed had taken aggressive policy action, but not enough to help the US avoid a recession caused by the coronavirus outbreak.
“鉴于不确定性，考虑到这么多人的收入锐减的事实，它最多可以帮助稳定金融市场，但很显然，它连这个没有做到。
"Given the uncertainty, given the fact that so many people have seen their incomes plummet, it could at best help stabilize financial markets, but it is clear that it has not done so."
”全球最大对冲基金桥水基金创始人瑞-达利欧表示：“新冠病毒没有吓到我，但新冠病毒疫情加上长期利率跌至零让我忧虑。
"I wasn't scared by the new crown virus, but the combination of a new crown virus and a drop in long-term interest rates to zero worried me," said Ray Dalio, founder of the world's largest hedge fund, Bridge Water.
”他还认为，最有针对性和规模适当的财政和货币对策来自中国。
He also argues that the most targeted and appropriate fiscal and monetary policy responses come from China.
在他看来，长期利率跌至0%的下限意味着，几乎所有资产类别都将走低，因为利率下降的积极影响将不复存在（至少不多）。
In his view, a fall in long-term interest rates to the lower limit of 0 per cent would mean that almost all asset classes would fall, as the positive effects of lower interest rates would disappear (at least not much).
高盛表示，美股的流动性已经来到了金融危机以来最糟糕的时候，目前美股做市商提供的买卖价差如同火箭般上涨，标普500期货市场的市场深度也来到了有史以来的最低水平。
Goldman said liquidity in the U.S. stock market was at its worst since the financial crisis, with U.S. market makers offering a rocket-like spread and the S & P 500 futures market at its lowest level ever.
Zerohedge评论称，美联储推出这种“雷曼式剧本”，表明美国现在正面临着系统性风险，其中还包括银行和公司，这种风险之前并不存在。
Mr Zerohedge commented that the Fed's "Lehman-style script" showed that the US was now facing systemic risks, including for banks and companies, that had not previously existed.
这也导致市场在短暂做出上涨反应后，可能加剧下跌，市场还需要观察美联储还剩下什么其他弹药。
It also makes it likely that the market will intensify its decline after a brief rally, and it will need to see what other ammunition the Fed has left.
另据消息，芝商所最新表示，美国股市的熔断机制可能会调整；建议美国股市的熔断机制调整为只有7%和13%的下跌限制；建议要求ETF市场遵守像其他市场一样的规则，遵守相同的熔断规则。
Separately, Sesame said recently that the meltdown mechanism in the US stock market could be adjusted; suggested that the US stock market meltdown mechanism be adjusted to a 7 per cent and 13 per cent fall limit; and suggested that ETF markets follow the same rules as other markets and follow the same rules of meltdown.

今日早间7点50分左右，美股期货再度走跌，主要指数期货跌超3%，似乎预示着美股的反弹可能会昙花一现。
At about 7: 50 this morning, U.S. stock futures fell again, with leading index futures falling below 3%, suggesting that a U.S. stock rally could be a flash in the pan.
欧洲股市尾盘拉升多国开启救市计划在美股反攻的带动下，欧洲股市也出现了尾盘拉升的情况。

欧洲多个国家出台做空禁令，其中法国将禁止做空24小时；比利时金融监管机构禁止卖空及类似交易；意大利证券交易委员会发布做空禁令，禁止卖空20只意大利证交所股票；阿联酋将自3月18日起，把股票日跌幅限制在5%。
