新京报记者周小琪 摄文 |新京报记者周小琪编辑｜陈晓舒 校对 | 李立军►本文约3308字，阅读全文约需6分钟1月23日，一封来自广州南方医院的“请战书”在网络流传，发起的是原第一军医大学南方医院赴小汤山医疗队（下称“赴小汤山医疗队”）。
Beijing News reporter Zhou Xiaoqi, editor, Zhou Xiaoshu, editor of the new Beijing News, or about 3308 words. It takes about six minutes to read the full text.

晚上8点，他们在南方医院停车场集合，上百位同事、家属拿着鲜花前来送行。
At 8 p.m., they gathered in the parking lot of the Southern Hospital and hundreds of colleagues and family came to see them off with flowers.
赴武汉医疗队队长郭亚兵和家人简单地吃了一顿年夜饭，便赶到了现场，他说，“我的任务就是把大家平平安安地带到武汉，再平平安安地带回来。
Wuhan medical team captain Guo Yabing and his family simply ate a Chinese New Year dinner, then rushed to the scene, he said, "my mission is to bring everyone safe to Wuhan, and then back in peace.
”出发前，队员们换上红色的志愿者服，在行李箱上贴上了“广东南方医院医疗队”的贴纸，排成一排，喊了三声“南方医院医疗队加油”的口号，便登上了前往机场的大巴。
"Before setting out, the team put on red volunteer clothes, pasted the" Guangdong Southern Hospital Medical Team "stickers on the suitcases, lined up, shouted three" Southern Hospital Medical Team refueling, "and boarded the bus for the airport.
这支医疗团队部分成员曾经在2003年支援北京小汤山医院，参与抗击“非典”，在当时，做到了医务人员“零感染”。
Some members of the medical team supported Beijing's Xiaotangshan Hospital in 2003 in the fight against SARS. At that time, they were able to achieve "zero infection" among medical staff.
新京报记者对话此次南方医院赴武汉医疗队队长、南方医院感染内科肝脏肿瘤中心教授郭亚兵，他也是17年前赴小汤山医疗队队长，他向新京报记者回忆了当年在小汤山抗击“非典”的往事，为抗击新型冠状病毒提供了借鉴。
This trip to Wuhan Medical Team Leader of the Southern Hospital and Professor of Infection Internal Liver Oncology Center of the Southern Hospital Guo Yabing, who was also the captain of the Xiaotangshan Medical Team 17 years ago, recalled to the Beijing News the past of the fight against SARS in Xiaotangshan and provided a reference for the fight against the new coronavirus.
出发前，队员们在行李箱上贴上“广东南方医院医疗队”的贴纸。
Before setting out, the team members affixed stickers to the luggage with the "Guangdong Southern Hospital Medical Team."
新京报记者周小琪 摄出征武汉：“我们需要发声，表达我们的意愿”剥洋葱：你们为什么会写下这封请战书？郭亚兵：很早之前，新型冠状病毒刚发现的时候，我们的队员王晓艳就提出来了写请愿书的建议。
"We need to make our voices heard and express our wish.Peeling Onions: Why did you write this invitation? Guo Abing: When the new coronavirus was discovered long ago, our player Wang Xiaoyan made a proposal to write a petition.
因为我们发现，这次疫情与非典非常类似，和当年在广州、北京的情况差不多，我们小汤山队员有充分的防护经验，做到了医务人员零感染，可以介入，给大家提供帮助。
Because we found that the epidemic is very similar to SARS, and the situation in Guangzhou and Beijing was the same, our team members have sufficient protection experience, achieved medical personnel zero infection, can intervene to help everyone.
经过小汤山锻炼的医生，更应该站出来，听调令。
After Xiaotangshan exercise doctors, but also should stand up to listen to the command.
我们需要发声，表达我们的意愿。
We need to make our voices heard and express our will.
请战不是一定要上前线，还不一定轮得到我们，比如55岁以上的医生，年纪比较大，不一定能上。
Please do not have to go to the front line, not necessarily our turn, such as 55-year-old doctors, older, not necessarily able to attend.
我们更多地是想给大家信心，提高大家战胜疾病的意志。
We want to give people more confidence to improve the will to overcome the disease.
剥洋葱：请战书发出来以后，医院决定派你们去了吗？郭亚兵：写了请战书之后，我们有很多同事退掉回家的车票、返程，都已经做好了准备。
When the letter of invitation was sent out, did the hospital decide to send you awayGuo Yabing: After we wrote the invitation, many of our colleagues returned home with their tickets and returned home ready.
医院今天决定，我们今晚8点出发，一共去24个人。
The hospital decided today that we were leaving at 8: 00 tonight. There were 24 people.
相关的呼吸、感染、心血管、急诊等科室都派了人，护理人员也会去，他们的工作很重要，占到一半以上的工作量。
The related departments of respiration, infection, cardiovascular, emergency, etc. are staffed, as are nursing staff, whose work is important and accounts for more than half of the workload.
小汤山经验：“划分了干净区、半污染区、污染区”剥洋葱：你们一共有多少人去了小汤山？去之前是什么心态？郭亚兵：呼吸、感染、心血管等各个科室的医生、护士、技术人员加起来一共是29个人，年纪最小的只有17岁，最大的42岁，大多数都是比较年轻力壮的。
How many of you went to Xiaotangshan? What was the mentality before you went? Guo Yabing: The doctors, nurses and technicians from all the departments of respiration, infection, cardiovascular and other departments add up to 29 people, the youngest being 17 years old and the oldest 42 years old, most of them younger and stronger.
作为传染病专业的人，上前线是我们分内的事。
As infectious disease professionals, it's our job to be on the front line.
医生护士跟老百姓一样，对疾病不熟悉的时候，也会觉得害怕。
Doctors and nurses, like ordinary people, are afraid of disease when they are unfamiliar with it.
但是经过专业的训练之后，对疾病的理解比老百姓要快，能更快克服焦虑。
But after professional training, the understanding of disease is faster than the common people, can overcome anxiety faster.
剥洋葱：你们在小汤山待了多久？主要做了哪些工作？郭亚兵：2003年5月初进去，到6月23日结束，接近两个月。
How long did you stay in Xiaotangshan? What work did you do? Guo Yabing: I went in early May 2003 and ended on June 23, nearly two months ago.
出发的时候，我也不知道要呆多久，还在考虑要不要带冬装，实际上待的比想象的时间短。
By the time I set out, I had no idea how long I was going to stay. I was wondering if I wanted to take winter clothes with me.
我们当时是在17病区，有30多张床位收治病人，所有的治疗都是由我们团队来负责。
We were in the 17 ward, with more than 30 beds for patients, and all the treatment was done by our team.

受访者供图剥洋葱：在小汤山期间，医疗队实现了“零感染”，是怎么做到的？郭亚兵：去小汤山之前，每个带队的队长都是要签军令状，保证队员一个都不感染。
How did the medical team achieve "zero infection" during the visit to Xiaotangshan? Guo Yabing: Before going to Xiaotangshan, each team leader had to sign a writ to ensure that none of the team members were infected.
小汤山的防护非常严格，有很强的组织能力、纪律性，说一不二。
Xiaotangshan's protection is very strict, has the very strong organization ability, the discipline, said is no different.
因为这是一个团队、系统的问题，任何一个人掉链子都不行。
Because this is a team, system problem, no one can drop the chain.
在小汤山时，我们有很细致的防护指南，划分了干净区（指行政和后勤办公的区域）、半污染区（指医护人员的居住区）、污染区（指病区）三个不同的区域，大家分开活动。
When we were in Xiaotangshan, we had very detailed protection guidelines, divided into three different areas: the clean area (administrative and logistics office area), the semi-polluted area (the area where the medical staff live) and the contaminated area (which refers to the diseased area).
像我们做传染病出生的，本身职业敏感性就很高，平时看发烧一定会戴口罩，也养成了洗手的习惯。
As we are born with infectious diseases, their own professional sensitivity is very high, usually look at fever will wear masks, also formed the habit of hand-washing.
跟人讲话的时候，习惯站在上风口，不会站在下风口。
When talking to people, the habit of standing on the upper air vent, will not stand in the lower wind.
有时在电梯里人多，比较拥挤，我就憋气，到了空房间再喘气。
Sometimes in the elevator more people, more crowded, I suffocate, to the empty room again panting.
其实传染对所有人都是一样的，只是看你有没有做到位。
Infection is the same for everyone, just to see if you can do it.
即使在装备缺少的时候，也要保证因陋就简，做到关键位置的防护，不能不洗手揉眼睛。
Even when equipment is scarce, make sure that the hoof is simple, that the key position is protected, and that you cannot rub your eyes without washing your hands.
比如在给病人插管的时候，口罩突然烂了，可以先憋着气给病人操作，弄完再去上风口喘口气儿。
For example, in the patients intubation time, the mask suddenly rotten, can be suffocated to the patient to operate, and then go to the wind vent to take a breath.
这样也能达到呼吸道隔离的效果。
Respiratory isolation can be achieved in this way.
剥洋葱：除了防护以外，还有哪些在小汤山的经验可以分享？郭亚兵：总结一句话，就是“心理要放松，但防护要到位”。
Onion peeling: In addition to protection, what other experience can be shared in Xiaotangshan? Guo Yabing: To sum up the sentence, "the psychology should be relaxed, but the protection should be in place."
微生物感染跟个人的免疫力密切相关，如果休息不好、焦虑，免疫状态紊乱，自然就更容易感染，所以我们不提倡疲劳战术。
Microbial infection is closely related to an individual's immunity, and if rest is poor, anxiety, immune disorders, naturally more susceptible to infection, so we do not advocate fatigue tactics.
医护人员要保持信心、乐观的状态，才能提高免疫力。
Health-care workers should maintain a state of confidence and optimism in order to improve immunity.
当年在小汤山时，大家心情很放松，该吃饭就吃饭，该运动还是要去运动。
At that time in Xiaotangshan, everyone was very relaxed, eat to eat, the movement or to go to sports.
医疗核心是医护人员，必须有战斗力。
Medical core is medical personnel, must have combat effectiveness.
关键是斗志，很多人斗志一垮，就没有战斗力了。
The key is fighting spirit, many people fighting a collapse, there is no fighting capacity.
面对未知的疫情，刚入职的年轻医生产生恐慌，不知道如何防护，我们必须告诉他们怎么防，要教会他们招数，让医护人员增强信心，不能让他们还没上阵就泄气，信心是最重要的。
In the face of an unknown epidemic, young doctors who have just entered the profession become terrified and do not know how to protect themselves. We have to tell them how to guard against it. We have to teach them how to do it.
剥洋葱：小汤山医疗队的队员们现状如何？郭亚兵：当年的队员都成为了医院各个科室的骨干，比如王晓艳，现在是脑外科的护士长。
Peeling Onions: What's the status of the members of the Xiaotangshan Medical TeamGuo Yabing: All the members of the team became the backbone of the hospital departments, such as Wang Xiaoyan, now the head nurse of brain surgery.
最小的那位队员，今年34岁，已经当妈妈了。
The youngest player, now 34, has become a mother.
我们现在有个群，每年还会聚两次，大家都是生死之交，感情还是不太一样。
We now have a group that meets twice a year, and we are all life-or-death acquaintances and relationships are different.
队员们在横幅上签字。
The players signed the banner.
新京报记者周小琪 摄疫情防控：“病人来了必须看，看了要处理”剥洋葱：你刚刚提到，这次疫情跟非典很相似，主要有哪些相同点？郭亚兵：和非典一样，武汉肺炎刚出现的时候，大家不知道它是什么病，传染途径、传染源、感染的厉害性、流行多久，这些都是未知。
You just mentioned that this outbreak is very similar to SARS, what are the main similarities? Guo A-bing: Like SARS, when Wuhan Pneumonia first appeared, people didn't know what it was, how it was transmitted, the source of infection, the severity of the infection and how long it was spread.
像非典是暴发两个月之后才知道，它是SARS病毒，武汉肺炎暴发不到一个月，很快鉴定出来是和SARS类似的冠状病毒。
Like SARS outbreak was known only two months later, it is the SARS virus, Wuhan pneumonia outbreak less than a month, soon identified as similar to SARS coronavirus.
相似的地方具体来说有四点，一是病毒来源不明，非典直到2017年才确认，来源是蝙蝠，这次疫情虽然也明确来源是野生动物，但具体是什么不知道；二是它的传染性，可以人传人，同时也都出现了医护人员感染的情况；三是我们都不知道，疫情会持续多久；四是病毒的发源地都是一个地点，非典是广东，这次是武汉，其他省份暴发的感染都跟武汉来的人相关。
The source of the virus is not known until 2017, although the exact source of the outbreak is not known, although the specific source of the outbreak is wild animals, but also reported cases of infection of medical personnel; third, we do not know where the virus originated, SARS in Guangdong, this time Wuhan, other provinces outbreak related to people from Wuhan.
剥洋葱：和非典相比，这次疫情在防控上有哪些难点？郭亚兵：从传染病控制的角度来说，第一是要控制传染源，非典的病征很明确，发烧、咳嗽等症状，很容易鉴别。
What are the difficulties in the prevention and control of this epidemic as compared with SARS? Guo Yabing: From the point of view of infectious disease control, the first is to control the source of infection.
但这次疫情的有的人发低烧，甚至不发烧，出现了一些轻症，只认为自己是感冒，鉴别难度大，所以不好控制传染源；第二是要切断传播途径，这次的病毒通过空气、飞沫传播或是皮肤黏膜传播，要戴口罩、勤洗手；第三是研发疫苗和预防性药物。
However, some people with low fever, or even fever, there are some mild cases, only think they are cold, difficult to identify, so difficult to control the source of infection; the second is to cut off the transmission route, this time through the air, droplets spread or skin mucous membrane, wearing masks, frequent hand washing; and the third is the development of vaccines and preventive medicine.
目前我们还找不到对抗病毒的有效药物，也没有疫苗。
At present, we do not find an effective antiviral drugs, nor do we have a vaccine.
现在人对新型病毒还没有免疫力，第一波接触的人可能会有抗体。
People are not immune to the new virus, and people who come into contact with the first wave may have antibodies.
所以目前只能从前两个方面来防控，我们医院现在单独设立了发热门诊，早诊早治，隔离接触人员，不能到处跑。
So only the first two aspects of prevention and control, our hospital now set up a separate fever clinic, early diagnosis and treatment, isolation contact personnel, can not run.
总体来说，这次疫情的控制难度要比SARS大，我们做好打持久战的准备。
Overall, the epidemic is more difficult to control than SARS, we are ready to fight a protracted war.
剥洋葱：南方医院也是此次疫情的定点医院，现在情况怎么样？郭亚兵：我们医院现在单独设立了发热门诊，感染病区已经腾出了70张床位，早诊早治，隔离接触人员，不能到处跑。
How is the situation now.Guo Yabing: We now have a separate fever clinic in our hospital, and 70 beds have been set aside in the infected area for early diagnosis and treatment, isolation of personnel and travel.
同时我们从全院抽调了人手，很多志愿者报名，最后选了50多人，都是年轻力壮的，我给他们做了相关的培训，诊疗的每个环节也都带着走了一遍。
At the same time, we drew manpower from the whole hospital, many volunteers registered, and finally selected more than 50 people, all young and strong, I gave them the relevant training, the diagnosis and treatment of every link also took a walk.
昨天凌晨，我到发热门诊去看，还有三四十个病人在，负担很重，这些病人来了必须看，看了要处理。
Yesterday morning, I went to the fever clinic to see, there are thirty or forty patients in, the burden is very heavy, these patients have to see, see to deal with.
广州南方医院外景。
Outside Guangzhou South Hospital.
新京报记者周小琪 摄剥洋葱：你们如何判断患者是否感染了新型冠状病毒的？郭亚兵：依据卫健委的指南和方案，一个是临床诊断，发热门诊有发烧的，就看有没有咳嗽、呼吸道症状等；抽血，看白细胞是不是低；拍胸片，判断有没有肺炎，再问流行病学史，有没有去过武汉，如果这些条件都符合这次的标准，就可以判定为疑似了，需要隔离。
How do you judge whether the patient is infected with the new coronavirus? Guo A-bing: According to the Wei Bodyguard's guidelines and plans, one is clinical diagnosis, fever clinic fever, see whether the cough, respiratory symptoms, and so on; Pap chest film, determine whether there is pneumonia, and asked epidemiological history, if these conditions meet this criteria, can be judged as suspect, need isolation.
二是病原学诊断，通过试剂盒对疑似病患采样，到疾控中心进行两轮核酸检测，两轮如果都呈阳性，就可以确诊病患感染了新型冠状病毒。
The second is etiology diagnosis, through the kit to sample suspected patients, to the CDC for two rounds of nucleic acid testing, if both rounds are positive, patients can be diagnosed with the new coronavirus.
有的患者没有发烧咳嗽。
Some patients do not have a fever or cough.
这种叫做前驱症状，可能患者就觉得没有力气，或者胃不舒服，不会想到是病毒感染的事情。
This is called precursor symptoms, may feel weak, or stomach discomfort, do not think it is a viral infection.
在前驱症状以后，马上就会开始出现典型症状，比如发烧、咳嗽，造成肺炎。
Typical symptoms, such as fever, cough and pneumonia, begin to appear immediately after the onset of the precursor.
病毒的个体差异很大，同一个病毒感染100个人，会有不同的症状，所以这也给确诊带来了难度。
The virus varies greatly from person to person, with 100 people infected with the same virus having different symptoms, so it also makes diagnosis difficult.
