国内疫情正在向好，但银行业务员们依然担心接下来工资降幅是否会更大？因为绩效工资的提升有赖于业绩指标的实现，但当前贷款发放首先要面临不良率上升的拷问摄影/黎立文|《财经》记者 张颖馨编辑| 袁满“生活不止眼前的苟且，还有远方的苟且。
As performance-based pay rises depend on the achievement of performance indicators, current loan disbursements must first face rising rates of torture / Lilly & # 160; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
”一名国有银行支行员工看到自己2月份不到3000元的工资，如是感慨。
A state-owned bank employee who saw his February salary of less than 3,000 yuan lamented.
据其透露，按照“底薪+绩效”的工资构成模式，身处经济下行期，叠加新冠肺炎疫情影响，而自己所在支行不良贷款率又畸高、效益差，终致绩效工资基本为0。
According to him, the "base salary + performance" wage structure model, in the next economic period, superimposed the impact of the New Crown Pneumonia, and his sub-branch non-performing loan rate is extremely high, poor efficiency, the final performance wages are basically 0.
相较而言，部分股份制银行、城商行员工的日子虽没有那么难受，但他们亦对疫情带来的影响感受颇深。
In contrast, some share-holding banks, comptoirs employees, although the days are not so difficult, but they also feel the impact of the epidemic.
多名一线银行员工告诉《财经》记者，虽然有收到绩效工资，但相较疫情前，2月份工资收入“跳水”超30%。
Several front-line bank employees told Caijing that despite receiving performance pay, February's payroll plunged more than 30 per cent from the pre-epidemic period.
但正如硬币的两面，积极的变化也在显现。
But as on both sides of the coin, positive changes are emerging.
有银行员工反映，疫情的出现，倒逼自己通过线上展业，虽然此前银行都在强调线上化，但从未有过一定要转变的紧迫感。
Bank employees reported that the outbreak forced them to move through the online display industry, and while banks had previously emphasized online, there had never been a sense of urgency to change.
“就像做饭一般，如果不把‘无米下锅’转变为‘找米下锅’，那最后只能挨饿”。
"Just like cooking, if you don't change the 'rice-free pot' to 'find rice in the pot', you'll end up starving.
复工首月：工资骤降超30%按照工作一天、休息一天的轮班规划，2月25日上午8时20分，许林如常到达自己所在股份制银行北京某支行。
The first month of return to work: wages plummeted by more than 30% according to the work day, rest a day shift planning, February 25 8: 20 a.m., Xu Lin as usual reached his share-holding bank in Beijing branch.
他主要负责小微企业主、个体经营户的贷款业务。
He is mainly responsible for small and micro-entrepreneurs, self-employed business loans.
疫情发生后，餐饮、旅游、电影、交运、教育培训等行业遭受极大冲击，许林虽身处金融行业，但也间接感受到这轮冲击波威力不小。
After the outbreak of the epidemic, catering, tourism, film, delivery, education and training industries suffered a great impact, although Xu Lin in the financial industry, but also indirectly feel the impact of this shock wave.
一方面，存量客户陆续提出延期还款申请，接下来的还款能力存疑；另一方面，线下办理业务的人越来越少，线上虽然贷款申请增加，但出于风险防控等因素，真正符合条件，能批复贷款的客户数量有限。
On the one hand, the stock of clients has been submitting applications for deferment and the subsequent repayment capacity is in doubt. On the other hand, there are fewer and fewer people conducting business offline, and although loan applications have increased on-line, there are only a limited number of clients who are truly qualified to approve loans due to factors such as risk prevention and control.
“按照每个月千万级的贷款额度发放指标，之前发放额度成倍增长，但目前自己能完成千万元的信贷投放就已经不错。
"We've doubled the amount of money we've disbursed up to ten million dollars a month, but it's good to be able to put in ten million dollars in credit right now."
”许林告诉《财经》记者，虽然分行会根据市场变化情况、支行规模等情况调整信贷额度分配和业绩考核标准，但当前想要完成对应的指标，依然有不小难度。
Mr Hui told Caijing that, although the branch would adjust the credit line allocation and performance appraisal criteria according to changes in the market and the size of branch offices, it was still difficult to meet the corresponding targets.
无独有偶，多家银行零售贷款业务开展也面临不小阻力。
Coincidentally, a number of banks retail loan business is also facing considerable resistance.
某银行信用卡中心业务员告诉《财经》记者，此前其主要是通过线下获取客户，疫情发生后，办公楼、校园等很多地方实行封闭管控，只能去超市、商场等地展业，活动范围大大缩小。
A bank credit card center salesman told Caijing that before the outbreak of the epidemic, mainly through offline customers, office buildings, campuses and many other places closed control, can only go to supermarkets, shopping malls and other places exhibition industry, the scope of activities has been greatly reduced.
相比之前，业务量下降至少一半以上。
Business volume has fallen by at least half since then.
这样的变化，或可从央行最新公布的2月金融统计数据中一窥端倪：新增信贷方面，2月新增人民币贷款9057亿元，仅同比微增199亿元。
Such a change may be seen in the latest February financial statistics released by the central bank: new lending of 905.7 billion yuan was added in February, a slight increase of 19.9 billion yuan over the previous year.
分部门看，住户部门贷款减少4133亿元，其中，短期贷款减少4504亿元，中长期贷款仅增加371亿元。
In terms of sub-sectors, household sector loans decreased by $413.33 billion, of which short-term loans decreased by $450.4 billion and medium- and long-term loans increased by only $37.1 billion.
业务量下降带来的直接结果就是工资骤降。
As a direct result of the decline in business wages plummeted.
许林及上述信用卡业务员均向《财经》记者表示，由于绩效考核部分受到当前环境影响，2月份工资下降幅度超过30%。
Both Mr Hui and the credit card salesmen told Caijing that wages fell by more than 30 per cent in February because of the current environmental impact of the performance review.
“这至少是有绩效工资可拿，目前我的新增业务量基本为0，只能领着底薪过日子。
"It's at least a performance salary," he says. "At the moment, my new business is essentially zero and I'm living on a base salary.
”一名股份行负责汽车金融的业务员直言，当前其所在团队业务基本已经停滞，大家天天蹲守家中，线上参加内部培训。
A car finance salesman at the bank blurted out that his team's business had largely stalled, with people squatting in their homes every day for in-house training.
据其透露，每年年后到5、6月份，本就是汽车行业的淡季。
According to its disclosure, the year after each year to May, June, this is the auto industry's low season.
今年受疫情影响，线下看车的人数量骤减。
The number of people watching cars offline has plummeted this year because of the epidemic.
虽然客流转移至线上，但由于不少汽车经销商的上游企业（汽车厂商）位于疫情重灾区，目前处于停产状态，无法及时供货。
Although the flow of passengers to the line, but many car dealers upstream enterprises (auto manufacturers) located in the disaster area, is currently in a state of production, unable to provide timely supplies.
没有现车，客户便不会下单。
Customers don't place orders without a cash car.
经销商自己的销售指标都无法达成，更何况与其业绩紧密挂钩的银行汽车金融业务。
Dealers cannot meet their own sales targets, not to mention the closely linked performance of the bank's auto finance business.
“我们获客主要是依靠经销商，他们能卖出车，我们才会有订单。
"We get our customers mainly through dealers who can sell cars and we have orders.
”上述业务员告诉《财经》记者，当下用户购车需求看似不小，但疫情带来的传导效应明显，目前能做的仅是观察供销商有何需求，尽量帮助他们解决燃眉之急。
The salespeople told Caijing that the current demand for cars may seem large, but the transmission effect is clear and all that is needed is to see what the dealers want and try to help them meet their immediate needs.
全年堪忧：信贷指标困境虽然目前国内疫情正在朝好的方向发展，但多名银行业务员向《财经》记者表达了同样的担忧，接下来工资下降幅度是否会更大？对许林来说，绩效工资的提升有赖于业绩指标的实现，但目前贷款发放存在不少现实难题，比如风控门槛无法过度降低。
Credit Indicators Trouble: Credit Indicators Although the epidemic is now heading in the right direction, many bank executives expressed the same concern to Caijing about whether the next wage decline would be greater. For Xu, the performance pay rise depends on the achievement of performance indicators.
据其透露，虽然自己所在的股份行推出多项针对受疫情影响企业的金融措施，但在实际操作中，风控门槛降低主要是针对与疫情防控直接相关，或是经营业绩良好并有一定规模的企业。
In practice, however, the wind-control threshold has been lowered for companies that are directly linked to disease prevention or control, or that are doing well and have a certain size.
再者，此前企业类客户主要是依靠固定资产抵押以获得贷款，而当前阶段主要是发放信用贷款，贷款审批通过率相较之前下降，最终体现为贷款发放量下降。
Moreover, whereas previously corporate customers relied mainly on fixed-asset mortgages to obtain loans, the current phase was dominated by the issuance of credit loans, whose approval rate declined relative to previous periods, culminating in a decline in lending.
为了给贷款风险“加把锁”，针对新增客户，许林会按照所在行要求，让客户购买保险。
In order to "lock up" the loan risk, Xu Lin will according to the requirements of the bank, let customers buy insurance.
与许林不同，部分城商行业务员采取了更为谨慎，甚至是“封闭”的态度。
Unlike Xu Lin, some comptoirs have adopted a more cautious, even "closed" attitude.
华南地区某城商行对公业务客户经理向《财经》记者坦言，除了硬性任务，如果不是比较稳妥的企业，基本上能不做就不做，毕竟这笔贷款一旦出现问题，无论涉及的金额高低，都会遭到问责。
A comptoir in South China confesses to Caijing that it can do very little, if at all, except for hard tasks, if not a sound business. After all, if there is a problem with the loan, it will be held accountable, regardless of the amount involved.
“之前做过一笔贷款，涉及到投行业务，之后出现了一些问题，遭到央行、银保监、上交所、我们总行的逐一审查，审查重点都不一样。
"After making a loan that involved the investment banking business, there were some issues that were examined on a case-by-case basis by the central bank, the BofA, the SSE and our head office, and the focus was different."
虽然最后证明我的工作没有问题，但这样一笔业务面临四遍审查，我还得担心可能面临的问责，身心都是煎熬。
Although it turned out to be all right, with such a business facing four reviews, I had to worry about the accountability I might face, both physically and mentally.
”上述客户经理说。
'said the client manager.
值得注意的是，此前监管指出，允许银行进一步提高不良贷款容忍度，并要求落实“尽职免责”。
Notably, earlier regulations had indicated that banks were allowed to further increase their tolerance of non-performing loans and required "due diligence exonerations."
但据《财经》记者了解，在实际业务开展过程中，银行业务员依然存在不少顾虑。
However, "Caijing" reporters understand that in the actual business process, the bank still has a lot of concerns.
“银行信贷人员工作涉及到个人的问责机制，若出现不良，其会被问责，影响到职业生涯，这导致一线的银行员工对企业信贷业务过于紧张。
"Bank credit people work with personal accountability mechanisms that can be held accountable and hurt their careers if they go wrong, leading front-line bank employees to be too tight on corporate credit."
‘尽职免责’我们一直都在做，但什么是‘尽职’，目前标准并不明确，最后变成了仍以结果为导向。
Due Diligence We've been doing this all along, but what's called due diligence is not clear at the moment, and it turns out to be still results-oriented.
”华南某银行企业业务负责人此前接受《财经》记者采访时表示，商业银行按照市场化运作，若出现一堆坏账，管理层肯定拿不到奖金，员工还谈什么绩效工资。
The head of business at a bank in southern China told Caijing earlier that commercial banks operate on a market-based basis and that managers are sure not to be paid bonuses if there is a pile of bad loans, and employees talk about performance pay.
虽然有银行零售业务员表示目前业务量影响没有太大，但其亦对自己2020年的绩效情况颇为担忧。
While some retail bankers say the current volume impact is small, they are concerned about their own performance in 2020.
“我们主要是对接房地产开发商，由后者介绍用户来办理公积金贷款和商业贷款。
"We are mainly docking real estate developers, the latter introduced users to deal with provident fund loans and commercial loans.
按照预约制，目前主要是处理之前已申请贷款的客户，最近因为出行受限，客户会推迟面签时间，数量上没有明显变化。
Under the advance booking system, clients who have previously applied for loans are now processed, and there has been no significant change in the number of clients who have recently delayed their face-to-face owing to travel restrictions.
”西南地区某城商行分行业务员告诉《财经》记者，虽然他不了解所在岗位业绩考核指标的具体构成，但毋庸置疑，接下来一些业务达标情况肯定会受到影响，而这与他今年的绩效收入直接挂钩。
Caijing, a branch clerk at a comptoir branch in the southwest, told Caijing that although he did not know the exact composition of the performance measures for his post, there was no doubt that some of the next business performance would be affected, which was directly linked to his performance income this year.
他的担忧并非空穴来风。
His fears were not groundless.
据《财经》记者了解，该业务员在2017年扣除五险一金后，拿到手的工资收入（底薪+绩效+年终奖）近26万元，但受近年来经济下行等因素影响，其在2019年拿到的总收入仅有12万元，这还是在他业绩指标均足额完成的情况下。
According to Caijing, the salesperson earned nearly 260,000 yuan in salary (base salary + performance + year-end bonus) after deducting five insurance premiums in 2017. However, due to the economic downturn and other factors in recent years, he received a total income of 120,000 yuan in 2019, even though his performance indicators were fully met.
“目前我们第一季度的绩效工资还未下发，但我已经差不多可以想象到‘惨状’。
"We haven't paid our first-quarter pay yet, but I can almost imagine the 'misery'.
若疫情持续，年终奖就更不乐观。
If the epidemic continues, the year-end bonus will be even less optimistic.
”上述业务员向《财经》记者调侃称，自己目前的状况就像是“温水煮着的青蛙”，颇为被动。
The salesperson joked to Caijing that his current situation was "like a frog in lukewarm water" and was passive.
倒逼转型：上线“找米”但也需看到，一些积极的变化正在发生。
Inverted Transformation: Find rice online, but also need to see that some positive changes are taking place.
许林直言，这次疫情给自己开展业务带来的最大影响，就是被逼着通过线上展业。
Xu said bluntly that the epidemic's greatest impact on his business was to be forced through the online exhibition industry.
“之前主要是通过线下网点开展业务，根本不会主动在线上通过微信等方式与客户联系，但此次疫情发生后，很多工作只能通过线上进行。
"Previously, we were doing business mainly through an offline network, and we didn't reach out to customers by e-mail," he said. "But after the outbreak, a lot of work had to be done online.
这才发现，线上流量也是你的资源，此前错失了将部分线下客户转化为线上资源的机会。
It turns out that online traffic is your resource, too, and you've missed the opportunity to turn some of your offline customers into online resources.
”许林给自己定下了小目标，即便身处线下网点，也要不断提高自己线上展业的能力，将线下用户有效转化。
Xu Lin has set himself a small goal, even in the offline dot, but also to constantly improve their online exhibition industry, the effective transformation of users offline.
监管亦通过政策引导金融机构加强线上服务。
Regulation also directs financial institutions to enhance online services through policies.
此前的2月1日，央行、财政部、银保监等五部门联合下发通知，要求“金融机构要加强全国范围特别是疫情严重地区的线上服务，引导企业和居民通过互联网、手机APP等线上方式办理金融业务”。
Earlier, on February 1, the central bank, the Ministry of Finance and the banking and insurance regulator jointly issued a notice requiring financial institutions to strengthen online services throughout the country, especially in areas with severe epidemics, and to guide enterprises and residents in handling financial transactions through the Internet, mobile phone APP and other online means.
据中国银行业协会此前统计，最近一段时间，各银行机构线上业务的服务替代率平均水平达到96%。
According to the China Banking Association, the average service substitution rate for the online operations of banking institutions has averaged 96 per cent in the recent past.
一场更大范围、规模的银行业数字化转型浪潮或将掀起。
A broader, larger-scale digital transformation of the banking sector is likely to occur.
北京市网络法学会副秘书长车宁告诉《财经》记者，此前很多银行都在谈银行数字化转型，但从对公业务领域的实践来看则有些不温不火，另外金融科技公司相关业务发展情况也并不理想。
Caijing, deputy secretary-general of the Beijing Institute of Cyber Law, told Caijing that many banks had talked about digitizing banks, but practices in the public sector had been tepid and business developments involving financial technology companies had been less than ideal.
出现这种问题的原因并不在于银行或者金融科技公司，而是在于企业侧对互联网的理解依然不够深刻。
The reason for this is not that banks or financial technology companies, but that the understanding of the Internet on the part of companies is still not deep enough.
此次疫情发生，线上办公（移动办公）等作为替代方式被大量推广，以此为契机有望促进企业去重新理解互联网在整个生产过程中的重要作用。
This outbreak, such as online office (mobile office) as an alternative has been widely promoted as an opportunity to promote enterprises to re-understand the important role of the Internet in the overall production process.
基于此，车宁进一步指出，随着企业对线上化、数字化的需求提升，银行机构To B端的金融科技业务亦能发展起来。
Based on this, Chengning further points out that as the demand for online and digitization increases, so can the financial technology business of the bank's To B end.
那些受疫情影响较小，且在金融科技等业务上走得比较积极、准备比较充分的大型银行、股份制银行等，在将来会有不错的表现。
Large banks, joint-stock banks that are less affected by the epidemic and are more active and well prepared in areas such as finance and technology will perform well in the future.
不过，亦有学者提醒，银行不能盲目通过金融科技进行变革，需从用户的真实需求等方面出发，谨慎考虑具体业务的发展方向。
However, some scholars cautioned that banks should not blindly adopt financial technology to make changes, and should carefully consider the development direction of specific business from the real needs of users.
据了解，近年来，部分银行大力发展无人网点、智能网点业务，但却面临无人到网点的现实难题。
It is understood that in recent years, some banks vigorously develop the unmanned dot, intelligent network point business, but face the reality of no one to the network.
尤其在疫情影响下，这样的情况更为突出。
This is particularly true in the context of the epidemic.
许林告诉《财经》记者，此前其所在银行支行每日客流量在40-50人，而目前每天到网点办理业务的人数则降至3-5人。
Mr Xu told Caijing that the number of customers at his bank branch had fallen from 40 to 50 a day to three to five a day.
其所在行智能网点亦面临同样的状况。
The same is true of the smart network points where it is located.
“我看过很多银行的智能网点、无人网点，设备非常多，运用了不少先进技术。
"I've seen a lot of banks with smart-network points, no-one's-spots, lots of equipment and a lot of advanced technology.
但有一个现实问题是，随着物理网点客流下降、用户行为的深刻变迁（很多用户已习惯通过手机银行等线上方式办理业务），若依然在线下设立如此高大上的网点，那给谁看？又给谁使用？”国家金融与发展实验室特聘研究员董希淼直言，银行应该思考的是无人到网点的问题，而不是开设无人网点。
But the reality is that, with the decline in physical network traffic and profound changes in user behavior (many users are used to doing business online, such as cellphone banking), who will see it and who will use it?
眼下，包括许林在内的等更多银行一线业务员，还面临一个更加现实的问题：通过线上展业，后续如何保持用户粘性？“每天晨会、晚会各一小时，逐一给客户打电话做业务营销，加上客户微信再拉群，接下来我们团队还要轮流在群内做直播……要想群活跃，保持粘性，就得发红包。
Now, many more front-line salespeople, including Mr. Xu, face a more realistic question: How to keep users sticky through online showersEvery morning and evening, we call our customers one hour at a time to do business marketing, and then our team takes turns to broadcast live in the group... If we want to be active and sticky, we have to give red packets.
但看看上个月‘羞涩’的工资收入，真不知道发红包能持续多久。
But look at last month's' shyness' of salary income, I really do not know how long red envelopes can last.
”某银行分行业务人员向《财经》记者表示，已明显感觉到线上化转型的紧迫性，但将此前很少运用的方式真正融入具体业务中，需要一个逐步探索、转变的过程。
Business people at a branch of a bank told Caijing that there was a palpable sense of the urgency of going online, but that incorporating previously infrequently used approaches into specific operations would require a gradual process of exploration and transformation.
