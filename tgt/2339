我们判断，等待复杂的流程转运到手术室，怕是等不及了。
We judged that waiting for the complicated process to be transferred to the operating room was too much to wait.
我们决定，把病人所在的单间隔离病房，作为临时手术室，直接在床边做微创手术。
We decided to use the patient's one-room isolation ward as a makeshift operating room to perform minimally invasive surgery directly by the bed.
如果用电钻，病人的骨末和血液的飞沫，会扩散得到处都是，对在场的医护人员，以及整个病房来说都很危险。
If you use an electric drill, the patient's bone and blood droplets will spread all over the place, making it dangerous for the paramedics present and for the whole ward.
所以只能用手钻，可以控制钻的速度以及用力的程度，尽量减轻喷溅的程度。
So can only use the drill, can control the drill speed and the degree of force, try to reduce the degree of spatter.

In an article published in the Chinese Journal of Epidemiology on February 17, 2020, 53% of patients diagnosed with New Crown Pneumonia in China did not report any underlying illness, according to an article published in the Chinese Journal of Epidemiology.
对于患有其它基础性疾病的新冠肺炎患者而言，他们的境况更加危险，医生在抢救这类病患过程中，面临的感染风险和救治难度都会更高。
New crown pneumonia patients with other basic conditions are at greater risk, and doctors are more likely to be at higher risk and more difficult to treat.
2月22日，武汉市协和医院西院区神经外科主治医师李琦接受南方周末记者采访，讲述一次抢救有基础疾病患者的过程。
On February 22, Li Qi, chief neurosurgeon in the western courtyard of Wuhan Concorde Hospital, gave an interview to Southern Weekend reporter about the process of rescuing patients with basic diseases.
2月21日凌晨，一位患有“慢性硬膜下血肿”的新冠肺炎病人突发“脑疝”，在李琦和同事的全力抢救下，病人成功脱险。
In the early morning hours of February 21, a patient with "chronic subdural hematoma" suddenly developed "hernia of the brain." With the full rescue of Li Qi and his colleagues, the patient managed to escape.
以下为他的自述：2月21日凌晨，我在协和西院6楼的隔离病房值完班，脱下防护服后，心情稍微放松。
In the early morning hours of February 21, I was on duty in the isolation ward on the sixth floor of the Concorde West Hospital. I took off my protective clothing and relaxed a little.
刚换完衣服，一个电话打过来，说西院11楼东病区，有一名慢性硬膜下血肿的病人陷入昏迷，让我立即过去抢救。
Just after changing my clothes, a phone call came calling to say that a patient with chronic subdural hematoma in the east of the west courtyard fell into a coma and asked me to come over immediately.
刚脱下的防护服赶紧又穿起来，搭乘电梯赶到11楼东。
Just off the protective clothing quickly put on again, take the elevator to the 11th floor east.
慢性硬膜下血肿是老年人群体的多发疾病。
Chronic subdural hematoma is a common disease in the elderly population.
脑萎缩之后，脑组织和颅骨之间的间隙增宽，头部受到轻微撞击就会出血，当出血量累积到一定程度，便压迫正常的脑组织，进而影响呼吸和心跳，我们称这种情况为脑疝。
After brain atrophy, the gap between brain tissue and skull is widened and bleeding occurs when the head is hit slightly. When the amount of bleeding accumulates to a certain extent, the normal brain tissue is pressurized, which affects respiration and heartbeat. We call this a hernia of the brain.
当天那位老人的突发状况就是脑疝。
The old man's emergency was a hernia of the brain.
脑疝意味着病人已处于生死线边缘，随时都可能去世。
A hernia means that the patient is on the verge of dying and could die anytime.
由于病人是新冠肺炎患者，住在重症隔离病房，结合病人早前CT影像和身体情况，我们判断，等待复杂的流程转运到手术室，怕是等不及了。
As the patient was in ICU with Newly Coronary Pneumonia, we decided to wait for the complicated procedure to be transferred to the operating room.
必须马上把堆积在脑内的血放出来，脑组织才能回归到原位。
The blood that had accumulated in the brain had to be released immediately before the brain tissue could return to its original position.
0时30分，我们决定，把病人所在的单间隔离病房，作为临时手术室，直接在床边做微创手术。
At 0030 hours, we decided to take the patient's one-room isolation room as a makeshift operating room and perform minor invasive surgery directly by the bed.
脑疝是脑外科最紧急的手术，对同时出现脑疝和新冠肺炎的患者实施手术，主要有两个难点。
Cerebral hernia is the most urgent operation in brain surgery. There are two main difficulties in the operation of patients with both hernia and new crown pneumonia.
一个是消毒，平时我们用碘伏消毒就可以，但对于新冠患者的手术，需要用碘酒和酒精，反复消毒6次。
One is disinfection, we usually use iodine volts disinfect can, but for the new crown patient surgery, need to use iodine and alcohol, repeatedly disinfect 6 times.
再一个，是对房间的消毒，包括床单、病人物品的消毒。
Another, is to disinfect the room, including the bedspread, the patient's articles disinfection.
颅内是一个闭合系统，脑里边最干净，你把它打开之后，跟外界相通，感染的风险很高。
The skull is a closed system, the cleanest inside the brain, you open it, the outside world, the risk of infection is high.
第二就是防护。
The second is protection.
这场手术必须上三级防护，戴外科或N95口罩、面屏，除了防护服之外，我们还必须要穿隔离衣，和一次性的手术衣。
The procedure involves three levels of protection: surgical or N95 masks, face screens, and, in addition to protective clothing, we have to wear protective clothing and disposable surgical clothing.
最外层是一次性无菌手术衣，和最外层的无菌手套一样，都是为了保护病人。
The outermost layer is a disposable sterile surgical garment that, like the outermost sterile glove, protects the patient.
不能光想着保护自己，还得要保护病人。
You can't just protect yourself, you have to protect the sick.
刘婕妤护士当天也是值班到夜里12点，我告诉她先不要离开医院，准备去11楼做手术，余光宏医生从附近的酒店赶到医院，这场手术由我们3个人配合完成。
Vergere was also on duty until 12: 00 p. m., when I told her not to leave the hospital for an operation on the 11th floor, and Dr. Yu Kwong Hong came to the hospital from a nearby hotel.
我们在换防护服的同时，赵华主任将这次手术所需要的部分微创器械，从汉口开车送过来。
As we changed our protective clothing, Zhao Hua drove over some of the minimally invasive equipment needed for the operation from Hankou.
15分钟后，器械到达协和西院，我们直接带着手术器械，到达11楼病房，0时50分，手术开始。
Fifteen minutes later, the equipment arrived at the Concorde Ward. We took the surgical instruments directly to the 11th floor ward. At 0050, the operation began.
头发是我给剃的。
I shaved my hair.
在外面剪头发是用电推剪，现在医院条件不允许，一时也找不到。
Haircut outside is done by electricity, now hospital conditions do not permit, also can not find for a while.
再一个，电推剪推得不干净，会有头发茬留在上面，一般都是用医院备皮刀。
Another, the electric shearing is not clean, there will be stubble left on the top, usually with hospital back-up knife.
因为不能预计手术的效果，我们一般会把头发全部剃光。
We usually shave our hair completely because we can't predict the effects of the operation.
如果微创效果不好，发现脑内大出血，要做开颅的准备，所以，必须先把头发全剃光。
If the minimally invasive effect is not good, the discovery of massive bleeding in the brain, to prepare for craniotomy, so that the hair must be shaved.
如果放了引流管再去剃头，第一程序过于繁琐，第二感染的风险会高很多。
If a drainage pipe is placed and shaved, the first procedure is too cumbersome and the risk of secondary infection is much higher.
我们先要用颅骨钻把颅骨钻开，放置一个引流管，让脑内的血顺着引流管出来，否则血越积越多，呼吸中枢受压过紧，就会停止呼吸，这就是脑疝导致死亡的原因。
We drill through the skull, place a drainage tube, and let the blood from the brain flow down the drain. Otherwise, the blood accumulates and the respiratory center is pressed too hard and stops breathing.
颅骨钻有两种，一种是电钻，一种是手钻，手钻就是手动的。
There are two kinds of skull drilling, one is electric drill, one is hand drill, the drill is manual.
但是这个病人，没有用电钻，因为电钻产生的气溶胶很多。
But this patient, did not use the electric drill, because the drill produced a lot of aerosols.
这是和我们平常做手术不同的地方，如果用电钻，病人的骨末和血液的飞沫，会扩散得到处都是，对在场的医护人员，以及整个病房来说都很危险。
This is a different place from what we usually do. If we use a drill, the patient's bone and blood droplets will spread all over the place, making it dangerous for the paramedics present and for the whole ward.
所以只能用手钻，可以控制钻的速度以及用力的程度，尽量减轻喷溅的程度。
So can only use the drill, can control the drill speed and the degree of force, try to reduce the degree of spatter.
手钻要求很高，如果钻得过深，就会导致新的出血和新的损伤，如果钻得过浅，后续的引流管放不进去，如果孔太大，那就失去了微创的意义。
The drill is very demanding, and if it is too deep, it can lead to new bleeding and new damage. If it is too shallow, the subsequent drains cannot be put in, and if the hole is too large, it loses its minimally invasive value.
而且这次还有一个新的挑战，平常我们戴一层手套，钻的时候手感很好。
And this time there is a new challenge. Usually we wear a glove and feel good when drilling.
但是，现在要戴三层外科手套，手会更紧，而且也没有触感，对深度的把握要差很多，在钻的过程中，能明显感觉到手感跟平常是不一样的。
However, now to wear three layers of surgical gloves, hand will be tighter, and no touch, the depth of grasp is much less, in the drilling process, can obviously feel the hand is not the same as usual.
钻到最后一层时，我们三个人都很紧张，病房里，大家屏息凝视。
When we got to the last floor, all three of us were nervous. In the ward, we stared at each other breathlessly.
引流管管径是4毫米，孔径是5毫米，多出来的这1毫米，就是医生放管的空间。
The diameter of the drain pipe is 4 mm and the aperture is 5 mm. The extra 1 mm is the space for the doctor to place the tube.
钻的时候，骨孔必须保证管子刚好能够进去，而且角度合适。
When drilling, the orifice must ensure that the tube is just able to get in and at the right angle.
置管的时候，由于没有太大的活动空间，我们要保证它准确地从骨孔穿过去，然后置放在合适的位置。
Since there is not much room for manoeuvre during tube placement, we should ensure that it passes through the orifice accurately and is placed in place.
如果引流管放得到位，通过脑组织自身的脑活动，就可以把血排出来。
If the catheter is in position, the blood can be excreted through brain activity in the brain itself.
21日的手术置管非常顺利。
The operation was very successful on the 21st.
管子约30公分长，整个过程一共引流70毫升的血，持续时间约两个小时。
The tube is about 30 cm long, draining 70 ml of blood throughout the process for about two hours.
最初，病人对我们的提问答非所问，而且，出现了嗜睡的症状，在抢救之前，甚至陷入昏迷状态。
At first, the patients answered our questions incorrectly, and there were symptoms of lethargy, even coma, before being rescued.
凌晨1时20分，手术结束，我们把消毒铺巾移开，呼唤病人，他慢慢睁开眼睛，而且能够说自己的名字，这意味着手术成功了。
At 1.20 a.m., when the operation was over, we removed the sterile wipes and called the patient, who slowly opened his eyes and was able to say his name, which meant the operation was successful.
