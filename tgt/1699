澎湃新闻记者 赵实1月27日，大年初三，以孙春兰副总理为组长的中央指导组，抵达疫情的“风暴眼”武汉，对新冠肺炎疫情一线防控工作等展开全面“督战”。
Peng Pai journalists Zhao Shi January 27, the Chinese New Year's Day, with Sun Chunlan as the leader of the Central Steering Group, the epidemic's "eye storm" Wuhan, the first-line prevention and control of the new crown pneumonia, and other comprehensive "war.
在这场疫情之战中，中央指导组担当着何种定位，将起到哪些关键作用，从其抵汉第一天起，便备受瞩目。
From the first day of its arrival in China, the Central Steering Group has gained prominence for its positioning and key role in the battle against the epidemic.
至2月20日，中央指导组已进驻湖北25天。
By February 20, the Central Steering Group had been stationed in Hubei for 25 days.
当天下午4点，将发布会现场“搬到前线”的国务院新闻办，在武汉再度举行发布会，中央指导组成员、国务院副秘书长丁向阳，中央指导组成员、国家发展改革委副主任连维良，中央指导组成员、国家卫生健康委党组成员、中医药局党组书记、副局长余艳红介绍中央赴湖北指导组组织开展疫情防控工作情况，并回答记者提问。
At 4: 00 p.m., the press conference was held again in Wuhan, where members of the Central Steering Committee, Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council Xiangyang, members of the Central Steering Committee, Deputy Director of the National Development and Reform Commission, members of the Central Steering Committee, Party Secretary and Deputy Secretary of the State Council.
中央指导组的各项工作进展与细节，医疗物资的调配与保障，医院床位紧缺问题的对策，疫情暴发以来有关湖北防疫工作的诸多争议……三位发布会人在这场为时超过1小时的发布会上，以中央指导组的角色进行了解答与回应。
The work of the Central Steering Group, the deployment and safeguarding of medical materials, the response to the shortage of hospital beds, and the disputes over epidemic prevention in Hubei Province since the outbreak of the outbreak were answered and answered by the three presenters in the role of the Central Steering Group at a press conference lasting more than an hour.
“宁要微辞，不要危机”“中央派指导组到来，是告诉武汉和全国人民，武汉不是‘孤岛’，武汉不是孤军作战。
Wuhan is not an isolated island and Wuhan is not an isolated island. Wuhan is not an isolated island and Wuhan is not an isolated island.
”一开场，丁向阳即讲述了中央派驻指导组来到湖北前线的用意和工作状态。
"From the beginning, Ding Xiangyang explained the intentions and working status of the central guidance group sent to the Hubei front.
“以孙春兰副总理为组长的中央指导组从抵达武汉的那一刻起，孙春兰同志和中央指导组的同志就同大家一起，每天都在通宵达旦地工作，在极度紧张和顽强的战斗中度过了这些日子。
"From the moment of their arrival in Wuhan, Comrade Sun Chunlan and the comrades of the Central Steering Group, headed by Vice Premier Sun Chunlan, have been working all night long, enduring intense and tenacious fighting.
”他介绍，按照中央的要求，中央指导组的主要职责有三项：一是督导湖北，把习近平总书记的指示和中央部署贯彻落实好，把各项措施布置到位，各项任务按目标、按预期完成，取得疫情防控的最后胜利；二是指导湖北抗击疫情，中央指导组的到来，就是要增强防控力量，为湖北协调一些重大事务，比如协调物资，协调医务人员，协调技术支持等；三是督察职责，督察不作为、乱作为、不担当的问题，依法依纪要求有关方面作出整改，作出调查处理。
At the request of the central government, the central steering group has three major duties: first, to supervise Hubei, carry out instructions and the central deployment of Xi Jinping well, put measures in place, and complete the tasks according to objectives and expectations.
丁向阳说，实际上，孙春兰副总理在1月22日来到武汉时，就按照总书记的具体指示和要求，做了两个决定，即“封城”和延长假期。
In fact, when he came to Wuhan on January 22, Vice Premier Sun Chunlan made two decisions, namely "sealing off the city" and extending the holiday, according to the specific instructions and requests of the general secretary.
针对有关武汉“封城”的争议，他回应，“在这样一个时刻，要达到共识恐怕不是太容易，但是有党中央的支持，我们决心已下，各项措施都到位，无论哪些人说什么，我们都坚定了这个决心。
"In response to the controversy over Wuhan's" sealing of the city, "he replied," It may not be easy to reach consensus at a time like this, but with the support of the CPC Central Committee, we are determined to put in place all measures, regardless of who says what we are determined to do.
有些同志在聊天的时候讲，在这个问题上，有一些议论和说辞都不要紧，我们宁要微辞，不要危机。
Some comrades, while chatting, said that there was no point in making any remarks or remarks on this issue. We would rather have a word than a crisis.
”在解决武汉医用物资短缺问题上，中央指导组发挥了至关重要的作用。
The Central Steering Group has played a crucial role in solving the shortage of medical supplies in Wuhan.
“指导组刚到武汉的时候，就发现武汉医用物资非常缺少，特别是防护服。
"When the steering group first arrived in Wuhan, it was found that Wuhan medical supplies were in short supply, especially protective clothing.
这时候，孙春兰副总理提出，第一，要省内挖潜，第二，后方由领导小组提供支持，靠其他省和进口补充。
At this time, Vice Premier Sun Chunlan proposed, first, to explore the province, second, by the leadership team to provide support, relying on other provinces and imports to supplement.
”丁向阳说，孙春兰副总理大年初四就带领指导组前往医用防护服生产企业，亲自给政策，支持他们开工复工、满负荷生产，希望把回家的职工高薪请回来，如果企业在此期间有亏损，国家给予补贴。
"Mr. Ding said Vice Premier Sun Chunlan led the group to medical-protective-clothing manufacturers on Thursday to support their efforts to get back to work and to produce at full capacity.
在患者救治工作上，丁向阳坦言，1月27日后武汉的疫情呈现出点状局部地区暴发和多点、多地大面积多发的情势，使指导组也感到了巨大的压力，“当时遇到的问题就是床位不足，群众住不上院，救治压力非常大。
After January 27, the outbreak of the epidemic in Wuhan took place in a point-like local area and a large number of multi-points and many large areas, which put great pressure on the guidance group.
”针对这个问题，中央指导组组织多方力量驰援武汉，争分夺秒开展救治工作，“我记得当时从全国调来了8支由专家牵头的医疗队到武汉，集中了三家大医院，协和、同济、人民收集重症，而后建立火神山、雷神山医院救治重症患者，把重症患者集中到一起，接下来又分类、分级、分层开展管理救治，建设11家方舱医院，8000多位患者现在在方舱医院，建立400多个隔离点。
"I remember that eight medical teams led by experts were sent from all over the country to Wuhan, where three major hospitals, Concorde, Tongji and the people gathered serious cases.
”他还介绍，孙春兰副总理要求实行应收尽收，刻不容缓，指示全市开展拉网式排查，不落一户，不漏一人，同时组织开展流行病学的调查，对传染源、传播途径、传播机理进行追踪和研究，及时研判疫情走向、走势。
"He also introduced that Vice Premier Sun Chunlan asked for the implementation of receivable, without delay, and instructed the whole city to carry out screening, not one house, not one person, while organizing an epidemiological investigation to trace and study the source of infection, transmission route and transmission mechanism, and to promptly assess the trend of the epidemic.
中央指导组也特别强调，要求武汉、湖北落实好四方责任。
The Central Steering Group also stressed that Wuhan and Hubei are required to fulfill the responsibilities of the Quartet.
丁向阳表示，下一步，中央指导组将继续推动湖北、武汉采取果断措施，防控源头，加强救治，“现在我们有3万多人居住在医院里，重症、危重症患者有一两千，要确保这些人员能够得到及时的救治，使重症患者变轻，使轻症患者康复出院，降低死亡率，提高治愈率。
"Now we have more than 30,000 people living in hospitals with one or two thousand seriously ill or seriously ill patients. We need to ensure that these people receive timely treatment, make serious cases lighter, rehabilitate the light patients out of hospital, lower the mortality rate and improve the cure rate
”“每条举报线索，孙春兰副总理都批示过”自疫情暴发以来，湖北在疫情防控工作中所暴露出的问题，也处于舆论漩涡之中。
"" Every reporting clue has been given orders by Vice Premier Sun Chunlan "Since the outbreak of the epidemic, the problems exposed by Hubei in the work of epidemic prevention and control have also been in the whirlpool of public opinion.
发布会上，有记者提到了日前中央指导组就病患收治问题约谈武汉市副市长等3人一事。
At the news conference, a reporter mentioned that the Central Steering Group recently interviewed three people, including the deputy mayor of Wuhan, on the admission of patients.
针对当前暴露出来的突出问题，中央指导组将如何督促武汉全力做好疫情防控？丁向阳回应，一段时间以来，特别是“四类人员”的集中收治、应收尽收过程中，一些干部存在底数不清、情况不明、救治不及时、责任不落实的问题，甚至在转运重症患者过程中衔接无序、组织混乱，导致群众严重不满。
How will the Central Steering Group urge Wuhan to do its utmost to prevent and control the spread of the disease? For some time now, especially during the process of centralized admission and collection of "four categories of personnel," some cadres have innumerable problems, unclear information, untimely treatment and responsibility problems.
对此，中央指导组对武汉副市长，武昌区、江岸区、洪山区以及湖北省、武汉市卫健委的负责同志进行了约谈，目的就是警醒广大党员干部必须进入战时状态，真正把人民群众的身体健康和生命安全在第一位。
To this end, the Central Steering Group conducted interviews with leading comrades from Wuhan Vice-Mayor, Wuchang District, Jiangan District, Hongshan District, Hubei Province and Wuhan City Healthy & Fitness Committee.
丁向阳还透露，一些群众在国务院“互联网+督察”平台上提供线索，媒体也组织大家收集一些应收尽收不落实的典型，“今天我在这里报告大家，这不是秘密，你们每天发现的每一个线索，孙春兰副总理都看过，都批示过，要求武汉和湖北迅速整改，立即开展救治患者的工作”。
"Today I am here to tell you that it is no secret that every clue you find every day has been read by Vice Premier Sun Chunlan, who has ordered Wuhan and Hubei to undergo rapid rectification and immediately start the work of treating the patients.
另外，中央指导组还组织有关方面和有关小组开展暗访督察，推动市区认真纠正偏差，迅速解决问题，举一反三，“我们给市和省发去了多封督察通知，这些工作都能得到及时的落实”。
In addition, the Central Steering Group has organized unannounced visits by relevant parties and groups to urge the urban areas to correct discrepancies and solve problems quickly.
