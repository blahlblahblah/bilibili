For more information see the European section below.
三、美国应对迟缓，前景极不乐观图3美国今日新增443例，达到1754例，明天破2000几无悬念。
The United States today has 443 new cases, up from 1,754 tomorrow, leaving little to be desired.
小编认为，美国领导人至今仍坚持两个重要判断：1）这个病完全是外来的，开始从中国，现在从欧洲。
According to Xiao Bian, American leaders still insist on two important judgments to this day: 1) The disease is completely foreign and started in China and now in Europe.
他不愿承认这个病已经主要是“内生”的。
He did not want to admit that the disease was largely "endogenous."
2）所谓疫情，主要是政治现象，是民主党和媒体在兴风作浪。
2) The so-called epidemic, which is mainly a political phenomenon, is being stirred up by the Democratic Party and the media.
这会造成经济损害，而传染病本身无足轻重。
This can cause economic damage, while infectious diseases themselves are insignificant.
所以迄今为止他的主要处方就是：一、辟谣加经济扶持；二、“旅行禁令”；三、顺便请大家注意卫生，万一感染主要靠淡定“自愈”。
So far, his main prescriptions have been: 1) rumour-fighting and economic support; 2) a travel ban; and 3) passing attention to hygiene in the event that the infection is largely self-healing.
完全忽视了隔离、筛查、救治、追踪这样的工作闭环对转染病防控的重要性。
The importance of isolation, screening, treatment and follow-up of this kind of working closed loop for the prevention and control of reinfection is completely neglected.
他把这个病毒看作是不堪一击的跳蚤。
He regarded the virus as a vulnerable flea.
倘若10个指头每天对付一只跳蚤，你确实可以淡定，甚至可以接受为“常态”。
If you have 10 fingers dealing with a flea every day, you can really calm down and even accept it as "normal."
但如果跳蚤快速繁殖，两周后变成100只，四周后10000只，六周后100万只，恐怕就很难再淡定了。
But if fleas breed fast, they become 100 in two weeks, 10,000 in four weeks and a million in six weeks, it will be hard to calm down.
而我们面前的病毒恰恰就有这样的繁殖力。
And the virus in front of us has exactly that kind of fertility.
考虑到新冠重症率大于10%，七周后重症人数就会远超美国现有病床数，那无疑是场灾难。
Given a new crown severity rate of more than 10%, it would be disastrous if, in seven weeks, the number of seriously ill patients would far exceed the number of beds available in the United States.
我们根据一些研究提出的R0（基本传染数）值做了一个指数方程，以下是几种比情况：湖北，疫情中心区+极强输入区目前拟合最好的一条曲线。
We have made an exponential equation based on the values of R0 (basic infection) proposed in some studies. The following are several comparisons: Hubei, the epicentre of the epidemic + extremely strong input area currently fitted the best curve.
前期报告数低于参照数，有“堰塞湖”原因，你懂的。
The number of previous reports is lower than the reference number, there are "Yan Sehu" reasons, you understand.
其实2月12日还有一次大的“堰塞湖”调整。
In fact, February 12 there is a large "Yan Sehu" adjustment.
后期报告数的趋势向有偏离参照线说明防控措施见效。
The trend in the number of late reports towards deviations from the reference line indicates the effectiveness of control measures.
国内非湖北强外部输入起步由于强外部输入病例+早期毫无预警+进入应急状态后能迅速做到尽收尽查，所以起步较猛，前期报告曲线明显偏左。
Domestic non-Hubei strong external input started because of the strong external input cases + early no warning + into the emergency state can rapidly do all the investigation, so the initial strong start, the early reporting curve significantly left.
刹车及时又使得2月初以后报告曲线迅速向右于2月13日后回到参照线右侧。
The brakes in time allowed the reporting curve to return rapidly to the right after the beginning of February and to the right of the reference line after 13 February.
韩国，输入起步，较早预警3月1日前完美拟合，之后应是防控措施生效，回归右侧。
South Korea, input start, early warning before March 1 perfect fitting, after which should be effective control measures, back to the right.
意大利，输入起步，应对较迟缓直到接近10000时才回到右侧，但仍保持近乎平行的上升势头。
In Italy, input started slowly and should not return to the right until close to 10000, but still maintained a near-parallel upward trend.
美国，应对很迟缓完全在估计上，几乎没有偏离。
In the United States, the response has been slow and almost non-erratic.
按此发展下去若没有足够干预，25天后病例数将破百万。
Without adequate intervention, the number of cases in 25 days will be more than one million.
需要注意的是，多方消息及多种证据均表明美国当前数据是被低估甚至严重低估了。
It is important to note that multiple sources and multiple sources of evidence suggest that the current US data are underestimated or seriously underestimated.
小编据此可以得出结论：再不真刀实枪采取行动，前景不堪设想！四、欧洲加强隔离和限流措施图4欧洲仍处在疫情的暴发阶段，还未到达峰值。
Europe is still in the outbreak stage and has not yet reached its peak. The European Union is still in the outbreak stage and has not yet reached its peak.

Patrick Vallance, Britain's chief science adviser, said the 590 confirmed cases so far suggested that there might be between 5m and 10,000 people infected locally, that the epidemic was estimated to be about four weeks behind Italy and that he expected the UK to reach its peak in 10 to 14 weeks.
