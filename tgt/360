记者/梁婷编辑/石爱华宋建华延边地区高速设卡进行防疫检查（图片来自网络）截至2月3日15时，新型肺炎累计报告确诊17252例，死亡361例，治愈485例，疑似病例21558人。
Up to 1500 hours on February 3, 17,252 cases of new pneumonia were confirmed, 361 deaths were reported, 485 cases were cured and 21,558 suspected cases were cured.
统计数据之外，有诸多密切接触者正在经历14天隔离。
Beyond the statistics, there are many close contacts going through 14 days of isolation.
他们可能只是碰巧，在高铁站、机场与人群中的一个感染者相遇，短暂交集后各奔东西。
They may just happen to meet an infected person at a high-speed rail station, airport, and crowd.
几天后，他们突然被告知，因与新型肺炎患者密切接触，被划定为“新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎病例密切接触者”，接着收到一封医学告知通知书，开始隔离。
A few days later, they were suddenly told that they had been classified as "close contacts of pneumonia cases infected with the new coronavirus" because of their close contact with patients with new coronavirus.
李萌是正在隔离的密切接触者之一。
Li Meng is one of the close contacts being quarantined.
她家住延边州，在广州工作。
She lives in Yanbian and works in Guangzhou.
1月23日她搭乘飞机落地长春。
She landed in Changchun on a plane on January 23.
在长春至延边的高铁上，她与一位后来被确诊的男乘客相邻而坐，得知消息后，李萌当场吓哭、她担心传染家人、还遭遇了信息泄漏，但她最终镇定下来，接受隔离。
When Li Meng learned of the high-speed railway from Changchun to Yanbian, sitting next to a man who was later diagnosed, she started crying on the spot. She feared infecting her family and had suffered a leak of information, but eventually recovered and was isolated.
李萌想告诉更多人，因防护到位，她至今无恙。
Li wanted to tell more people that she was safe from the attack.
隔离期间，确诊乘客的个人信息在网络流传、其中不乏恶意评论，但李萌从没怪过这位老乡，“我和他一样，都是在外漂泊一年的返乡人，我们不该责怪感染者，我们共同的敌人是病毒不是病人。
While personal information about confirmed passengers circulated on the Internet during the quarantine period, and some malicious comments were made, Li was never surprised by her, saying, "Like him, I am a homebound person who has been away for a year, and we should not blame the infected.
”以下是她的自述。
Here is her account of herself.
李萌的购票记录显示，她与一位确诊病例乘坐同一车次，同车厢，座位相邻吓哭了看到群里转发文件截图时，是1月29日下午两点左右，我正和朋友在饭店吃饭。
Li Meng's ticket purchase records showed that she had travelled on the same bus with a confirmed case, and that she had cried with her neighbors. When she saw the screenshots of the documents being forwarded in the group, it was around 2 pm on January 29, when I was having dinner with my friends in a restaurant.
文件的标题是“密切接触者协查”，内容是一位27岁男性肺炎患者从武汉回延边的出行全记录，其中第二条消息让我有点害怕，他的乘车日期是1月23日、乘坐车次、车厢号和我一模一样，他的座位是7A，我是7C。
The document, entitled "Close Contacts," contains a full record of a 27-year-old man with pneumonia travelling from Wuhan to Yanbian. The second message scares me a bit. His ride date is January 23 and the bus number is exactly the same as mine.
我确实有点慌，当时很着急，怕旁边桌听到引起恐慌，就跑到一边，在相对隐蔽的桌位开始打电话。
I was really nervous, afraid the next table would hear cause panic, so I ran away and began to make phone calls at a relatively hidden table.
同桌的朋友其实也害怕担心，他们也有点生气这个人在那个时候回来。
The table-mates were actually afraid and worried, and they were a little angry that the man had come back at that time.
我先打给了在政府机构工作的朋友，想让她帮我看看到底是不是真的。
I called my friend at a government agency and wanted her to help me see if it was true.
我要吓死了，一直催促朋友快点查。
I'm scared to death. I keep urging my friends to check.
朋友回复说那个人是疑似病例，没有确诊，让我别乱想，还说挨着近也不用怕。
Friends replied that the person is a suspected case, no diagnosis, let me not think about it, and said close to do not be afraid.
电话里，她念座位号的时候，我吓哭了，是真的。
When she read the seat number on the phone, I cried. It was true.
当时心里就两个字：卧槽！我觉得应该不会有这种“缘分”吧。
At that time the two words in mind: Sleeping slot! I think there should be no such "fate."
后来我打电话给延边州疾控局、图们市疾控局、图们人民医院，希望进一步核实消息，当时得到的回复都是还没有确认。
Later I called Yanbian CDC, Tumen City CDC, Tumen People's Hospital, hoping to further verify the information, the response received at that time has not been confirmed.
考虑到和他没有任何肢体以及语言接触，我也不那么怕了。
Considering that I had no physical or verbal contact with him, I was not so afraid.
我又给我妈打了电话，她让我不要慌张，等她去接我回家。
I called my mom again, and she told me not to panic until she picked me up.
从饭店回家也就十几分钟，我妈让我别怕，说是人为的恐慌，不会有事儿。
Just ten minutes from the hotel, my mother told me not to be afraid, that it was a man-made panic, will be all right.
我那时候没有再哭，就是内心很愧疚，担心传染家人，他们岁数都较大。
I did not cry at that time, is very guilty of the heart, fear of infecting their families, they are older.
也担心传染朋友，要不是和我吃饭，他们的爸妈也不同意他们出家门。
They were afraid of infecting their friends, and if they hadn't eaten with me, their parents wouldn't allow them to leave the house.
1月30日官方公布他确诊的消息。
His diagnosis was officially announced on January 30.
当天下午三点多，我正式收到了医学观察告知书。
More than three o'clock that afternoon, I officially received the medical observation notice.
社区的工作人员开始跟我对接，发给我一个密切接触者的居家医学观察提示，我就按照上面的提示严格遵守。
The community began docking with me, sending me a close contact with a home medical observation prompt, and I followed the instructions above.
我每天上午八点五十、下午两点五十测体温，然后发给她们。
I take my temperature at 8: 50 a.m. and 2: 50 p.m. every day and send it to them.
我还准备了一个小喷壶，装了点含氯的漂白水（消毒水卖光了），每隔一个小时喷一次。
I also prepared a small spray bottle filled with chlorine bleach (the disinfectant was sold out) and sprayed every other hour.
我不出门，就在家乖乖待着。
I won't go out, just stay at home.
最近有时候会感到胸闷，但是我不发烧，而且吃嘛嘛香，我就没那么担心了，可能是心病。
Recently, sometimes feel chest tightness, but I do not have a fever, and eat it Well, I am not so worried, may be heart disease.
我有一大半时间都在刷疫情的新闻，这两天最让我忧心的是无症状感染者，我担心自己是（无症状感染者），我忍不住要不断地看新闻，我不能没有信息，无知才会让我恐慌。
I spent most of my time on the news of the epidemic, the asymptomatic infections that worry me most these two days, I worry about being (asymptomatic), I can't help but keep watching the news, I can't lose the information, ignorance will scare me.
我拿无症状感染者的经历，和我的经历互相佐证。
I use the experience of asymptomatic infections to corroborate my experience.
他们大部分发病都比较早，我第七天才开始隔离，身边的人都没事，这大大减少了我的恐惧感。
Most of them got sick early, and I didn't start quarantine until the seventh day. The people around me were fine, which greatly reduced my fears.
其实我想过拍CT，但我妈说，没症状，能不去医院就不去。
Actually, I was thinking about taking a CT, But my mom said, no symptoms, you can't go to the hospital.
李萌每天两次向社区汇报体温，图为聊天记录要冷静我胆子很小，疫情发酵以来，一直小心翼翼。
Photo shows Li Meng reporting her temperature to the community twice a day. Photo: Calm down.
1月22号我还在广州上班，看到人民日报统计的数据显示：截至1月21日23时，湖北有270例确诊的，广东有17例，很害怕。
As of 2300 hours on January 21, there were 270 confirmed cases in Hubei and 17 cases in Guangdong, which made me very scared, according to statistics from the People's Daily.
我不敢坐地铁，出门尽量打车，上班时都戴着口罩。
I don't dare to take the subway. I try to take a taxi when I go out.
当时办公大楼的电梯按钮都贴着每小时消毒一次的提示。
The elevator button in the office building was marked with an hourly reminder of disinfection.
我还看到有人转发一些报道，按照数据模型估计，当时（21日）至少7000人感染，我还纳闷这是什么“妖魔鬼怪”。
I also saw reports being relayed estimating that at least 7, 000 people were infected at the time (21), and I wondered what this was.
因为广州属于比较严重的区域，在回家路上，我做了很多个人防护。
As Guangzhou is a relatively serious area, on the way home, I did a lot of personal protection.
1月23日早上8点，我从广州飞长春。
January 23rd At 8 a.m. I flew from Guangzhou to Changchun.
朋友给了我几个N95口罩，我在飞机上用了，脸都勒疼了。
My friend gave me a couple of N-95 masks and I used them on the plane and my face ached.
我特地升舱到公务舱，尽可能减少人群接触。
I specially upgraded to business class to minimize crowd contact.
换乘高铁后，我马上换了新口罩，除了喝水没摘下来过。
After changing to the high-speed train, I immediately changed my mask, except that I didn't take it off.
虽然不知道有没有用，我本着预防的心理，路上喝了999感冒灵。
Although do not know whether it is useful, I in the spirit of prevention, drink 999 cold on the road.
到家以后，我先把衣服洗了，用的是衣用消毒液。
After I got home, I washed my clothes first, using disinfectant.
拖地也是用的含氯的漂白液。
The floor is also cleaned with chlorine bleach.
我记得7A座的男乘客，他全程戴口罩，是黑色的一次性医用口罩。
I remember the male passenger in seat 7A, who wore a mask all the way, a black disposable medical mask.
他打电话的时候，口罩也没摘过，全程没有咳嗽。
When he called, he didn't take off his mask, and he didn't cough the whole way.
我和他没有较为直接的接触。
I have no direct contact with him.
根据网上的消息我了解到，他27岁，现在基本不发烧，说明年轻人抵抗力强，可能真的会战胜病毒。
According to online sources, he is 27 years old and now has little fever, suggesting that young people are resistant and may actually overcome the virus.
回家这么久，我没有任何症状，这说明只要防护措施到位，对于隔绝感染是有效的。
I haven't had any symptoms since I've been home for so long, which suggests that if protective measures are in place, they can be effective in protecting against infection.
我有时候也会胡思乱想，担心万一有意外，感染家人。
Sometimes I have fantasies and worry about infecting my family in the event of an accident.
他们大部分都50到70岁。
Most of them are between 50 and 70 years old.
我哥因为和我一起吃过饭，也被隔离了，他有一点轻微的咳嗽，因为家里有小孩，他搬到了一个人单间居住。
My brother was quarantined for having dined with me, and he had a slight cough, and as he had children in his family, he moved into a private room.
他在单位接触过的同事也隔离了。
His colleagues he met at work were also quarantined.
我和哥哥现在都不出屋，每天会微信聊天，他一直安慰我“啥事没有”，让我好好吃饭，好好睡觉，不要有心理压力。
My brother and I now do not go out of the house, every day to chat letters, he has been consoling me "nothing", let me eat well, sleep well, do not have psychological pressure.
我的隔离期到2月6日，现在虽还在观察期，但已经过了发病高危期，我现在很淡定。
My isolation lasted until 6 February, and I am still observing it, but it is past the critical period and I am not sure.
只是我的家人蛮恐慌，他们担心我，我二姨都急哭了。
It's just that my family is scared. They're worried about me. My aunt is crying.
今年我大姨66周岁生日，初六是我爸生日，我们原本打算过年一起聚一聚，现在我只能在家待着。
This year, my aunt 66 birthday, sixth day is my father's birthday, we had planned to spend the New Year together, now I can only stay at home.
我也给公司报备过，领导很好，让我不用担心，安心隔离。
I also reported to the company, the leadership is very good, let me not worry, peace of mind isolation.
到现在我和家人都没有任何问题，虽然咱不唯心，但要相信精神的力量，我们人类有主观能动性。
So far my family and I have no problem, although we do not mind, but to believe in the power of the spirit, we have the human initiative.
要冷静下来，慌乱解决不了问题的。
Calm down. You can't solve problems in a hurry.
现在，我真的很想喝一杯波霸奶茶，也很想念广州榕记的冻柠茶。
Now, I really want to have a cup of Bobar milk tea, but also miss the frozen lime tea in Guangzhou banyan.
从武汉回乡的男乘客被确诊“新型肺炎”后遭到网友的恶评，他在朋友圈发表了个人声明受害人这两天我刷微博，看到很多人在骂我邻座的乘客，网传的文件把他的家庭住址、电话、身份证号全都泄漏出去。
After being diagnosed with "new pneumonia," a male passenger returning from Wuhan was criticized by netizens. He made a personal statement in a circle of friends.
怎么能把个人信息全部发出去呢？不要负责任的吗？网上有很多责怪他的声音，比如：‘明知自己有病，还回来”、“该死的，不好好在武汉待着，回来干什么，要被气死了”、“把他揪出来挨打吧”。
How can I send out all my personal information? Do not be responsible? There are many voices on the Internet blaming him, such as: "I know I am ill, return," "Damn, do not stay in Wuhan, back to do, will be angry to be killed", "get him out of the box.
看到这些我很难受，我很想替他说话，但又怕引起更大的恐慌。
I felt terrible to see this, and I wanted to speak for him, but I was afraid of causing more panic.
我想着，等我隔离完了再说。
I thought, when I'm done quarantining.
后来，我在网上看到他的自述。
Later, I read his self-report on the Internet.
他说，23号从武汉出来的时候没有出现任何症状，在长春机场也做了体温测试，因为不放心，他回家前，还特意到图们市人民医院进行了血常规检测和CT检测，医生让他隔离观察。
He said the 23rd had come out of Wuhan without any symptoms and had a temperature test at Changchun airport. He also had a blood test and a CT test at the People's Hospital in Tumen before returning home.
他回家以后，24号出现症状，发烧37.4度，吃了药以后体温一直是36度左右。
He returned home with symptoms on 24, a fever of 37.4 degrees and a temperature of about 36 degrees after taking the drug.
28号疾控中心通知他需要做核酸检测，他凌晨接到通知，才知道自己是疑似，但当时也还没有确诊。
CDC 28 informed him he needed a nucleic acid test, and he was notified in the early hours of the morning that he was suspected, but the diagnosis had not been made.
他在自述中提到，如果知道自己患病，是不会回来的，他自己压力也很大，他爱延边。
He mentioned in his self-report that if he knew he was ill, he would not come back, that he was under great pressure and that he loved Yanbian.
一些延边本地人生气，原因在于，武汉23号关闭了离汉的机场和火车，有人认为，他在1月23号还回来，存有侥幸心理。
Some Yanbian locals are angry that Wuhan 23 closed the airport and train to Han, and some believe he returned on January 23 for what he needed.
事实上，他的航班在10点前，当时机场没关。
As a matter of fact, his flight was before 10: 00, when the airport was closed.
我相信他可能和我一样，也是工作忙到最后一天，一年就等着这一次回家，在家的人可能感受不到漂来漂去的心理。
I'm sure he's as busy with his work as I am, waiting to get home this time of year. People at home may not feel the drift.
当然这是个人选择，我讲这些也不是给他加同情分，只是希望多些换位思考，少一些网暴。
Of course it's a personal choice, and I'm not saying this to give him sympathy, but just to think more about it and less about it.
公众对他“有风险就不要回来”的要求，也能理解，病毒谁都恐慌，但我想说，我就坐在他旁边，我也不会怪他，这是系统排的座位，不是他选择和我坐在一起的。
The public's demand that he "risk or not come back" was understandable, as was the fact that the virus panicked, but I wanted to say that I was sitting next to him, and I would not blame him. It was a systematic row seat, not the one he chose to sit with me.
我没有理由去责怪他生病，更不会骂他。
I have no reason to blame him for his illness, much less for scolding him.
他是受害人，他也不想这样。
He's a victim, and he doesn't want to.
我希望他健康病愈，27岁，人生才刚开始。
I hope he recovers from his health. He's 27 years old, and his life is just beginning.
朋友后来跟我说，我们一节车厢的人员信息都流出去了，很详细。
My friend later told me that all the information about the people in one of our cars had been spilled out.
我真的很生气，我最怕影响爸妈的生活。
I am really angry. I am afraid to influence my parents' life.
我给疾控中心打电话投诉，他们也很着急，在控制。
I called the cdc to complain, and they were worried, controlling.
他们解释，之前是微信群进行工作，容易信息流出，现在改为点对点工作。
They explained that previously there was a micro-group working, easy flow of information, now a point-to-point work.
经历这次事情，我最大的感受就是不要曝光病人及密切接触者的信息，这不仅对停止病毒传播没有任何帮助，也是违法的。
After this experience, my biggest feeling is not to expose patients and close contacts, which is not only not helpful to stop the virus transmission, but also illegal.
我希望我们不要互相排斥，我们共同的敌人是病毒。
I want us not to be mutually exclusive. Our common enemy is the virus.
