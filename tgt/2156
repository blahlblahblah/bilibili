作者 | 赵磊编辑 |周昶帆三个微信群，上千条语音消息，一百多次发红包记录，从正月初三晚上开始算起，一款名叫“微乐麻将”的微信小游戏占用了曾雪大部分的时间，受疫情影响，她已经在家里待了一个月，除了到楼下超市买过两次菜，一个亲戚朋友都没有见过。
At the beginning of the third night of the first month, a micro-letter game called "WeiLe Mahjong" has occupied most of Zeng's time. Affected by the epidemic, she has been at home for a month and has not seen any relatives or friends except for two trips to the supermarket downstairs.
平日里，曾雪很少打麻将，只在过年期间和家人玩一玩，但今年情况特殊，所有人被关在家里，带有强社交属性的麻将游戏成了很多人解闷、联系感情的好方法。
On weekdays, Zeng Xue rarely played Mahjong, only during the Chinese New Year to play with their families, but this year, the special circumstances, all locked up at home, with strong social characteristics of Mahjong has become a lot of people to relax, feelings of the way.
初四晚上，曾雪自己建了一个群，拉进来十几个亲戚，一位年近七十的大姐怎么都不会设置，一会说自己胡不了牌，一会又说微信不能发红包，把一起玩的几个人搞得焦头烂额，曾雪在群里反复用语音教她，折腾了一整晚，要不是小区管制，她恨不得直接去大姐家里当面教。
On Thursday night, Zeng Xue himself built a group, dragged in a dozen relatives, a nearly 70-year-old elder sister how can not set, one said he can not Hu card, and then said that micro-letter can not play red packets, played together several people, Zengxue repeatedly in the group with phonetic teaching, she would like to go directly to my sister's home.
每年春节，棋牌游戏都会迎来阶段性增长，但在短暂的假期过后又会迅速回落，而在平时，棋牌游戏的用户群都比较固定，尤其在地方棋牌游戏这一领域，靠地推和代理获客的模式导致产品竞争十分激烈。
Every Spring Festival, the game of chess will usher in periodic growth, but after a short holiday will quickly fall back, and in ordinary times, chess game users are more fixed, especially in the field of local chess game, by push-and-seek mode leads to intense product competition.
突如其来的疫情为地方棋牌游戏带来一大波新增流量，今年春节走亲访友、聚餐打牌的现象明显减少，棋牌室、麻将室也都关门歇业，牌友的“战场”从线下转移到线上，在微信小游戏里，棋牌游戏表现十分亮眼，日活跃用户数（DAU）、用户时长、留存等数据都远超平时。
The sudden outbreak of the epidemic has brought a wave of new traffic to local chess games. This year's Spring Festival visits to friends and relatives, the phenomenon of playing cards has been significantly reduced, chess rooms, mahjong rooms have been closed, players' "battleground" from the line to the line, in micro-letter game, the number of active users (DAU), user time, retention and other data are far more than usual.
除了棋牌之外，全民向、休闲向的小游戏也在疫情持续期间迎来爆发，据阿拉丁指数统计，从春节假期开始，日榜排名第一名的小游戏一直是烧脑解谜类产品《我不是猪头》，同样属于烧脑类的《解救小宝》和《脑洞2020》也名列小游戏排行榜前十，《星星爆爆乐》和《眼力达人》等消除类、益智类小游戏也表现出众。
In addition to chess, popular, leisure-oriented games have been at the top of the list since the start of the Spring Festival, according to the Aladdin Index. Brain-burning "Save the Pig" and "Cave 2020" also top the list, as did "Star Explosion" and "Eye Strike."
“虽然行业的短期红利大部分都被《王者荣耀》等头部产品拿走了，但全民在家赋闲还是给我们小游戏行业带来了一些好处，这也是一个难得的出爆款的机会。
"While most of the industry's short-term dividends have been taken away by head products such as" The Glory of the King, "it is a rare opportunity for the industry to reap some of the benefits of leisure at home.
”小游戏制作公司游点好玩发行负责人廖帅对燃财经表示。
Liao Shuai, head of playful distribution at the small game production company, told Flaming Finance.
疫情是突发的，对于很多小游戏公司来说，产品层面无法及时应对，不过在运营层面和发行层面，还可以采取一些有效举措来抓住机会，取得业务的短期增长。
Outbreak is sudden, for many small game companies, product-level response is not timely, but at the operational and distribution levels, there are still some effective measures to seize opportunities to achieve short-term business growth.
但疫情总会过去，从长期来看，好的创意和品质，才是小游戏公司立足的根本所在。
But the epidemic will always pass, from the long-term perspective, good creativity and quality, is the basis of small game companies.
全民宅家，小游戏爆发在这个漫长假期里，如何消磨时间化解无聊，成了中国各个年龄段的人所面临的共同问题，在互联网发达的今天，不同年龄层的人也有各自的网上娱乐方式，看视频、唱歌、玩游戏、在线社交、在线阅读，萝卜青菜各有所爱，越能覆盖更多人群，越能充分享受这波短期红利。
With the development of the Internet, people of all ages have their own online entertainment methods, watching video, singing, playing games, socializing online and reading online. The more people can enjoy this short-term dividend, the more they can reach more people.
QuestMobile报告显示，受疫情影响，史上最长假期、最宅春节诞生，互联网日活跃用户规模、日均用户使用时长均创历史新高，各细分领域中，短视频、游戏、在线社交和新闻资讯受益最大，出于民众对疫情信息和亲友健康的关注，微信、QQ、微博、今日头条、腾讯新闻、抖音、快手等信息发布和交流渠道获得了最多的新增流量，而高度依赖渠道分发的小游戏，也获得了一次绝佳的表现机会。
According to the QuestMobile report, the longest holiday in history, the most frequent Spring Festival in history, the largest number of active Internet users and average daily user time. Short videos, games, online social networking and news messages benefited the most from the epidemic, according to the QuestMobile report.
烧脑益智游戏《我不是猪头》，就是一匹突然杀出的黑马，在春节期间连续霸榜阿拉丁小游戏榜，甚至压过了属于棋牌类的老牌强势游戏《欢乐斗地主》。
Brain puzzle game "I am not pig head," is a sudden out of the dark horse, in the Spring Festival continued to dominate Aladdin small game list, even the chess category of the old powerful game of "Joy Fight Landlord.
《我不是猪头》的制作方“有点意思”称，这款产品最高小时内活跃峰值达到了200万，日活达到1300万，远超往年同期爆款的产品数据。
The creator of "I'm Not a Pig's Head" said the product had a peak of 2 million activity in its peak hours and lived to 13 million a day, far more than in the same period in previous years.
这款小游戏的主要内容是脑筋急转弯，核心玩法是通过解谜答题提升自己的智力等级，如通过前十关可以达到小学三年级。
The main content of the game is a brain turn, the core of the game is to solve puzzles to improve their intellectual level, such as through the top 10 can reach the third grade of primary school.
商业化设计上，《我不是猪头》依靠对局内提示进行激励广告设计，观看广告获得关卡的正确解题思路，除此之外游戏还设计了社交激励，玩家可以寻求场外援助，其他用户进入到游戏也会为玩家提供正确答案，从而拉升游戏本身的用户裂变。
In terms of commercial design, "I'm not a Pig's Head" relies on motivating the ad design of the board and watching the ads get the right answers to the level of the game. In addition, the game is designed to provide a social incentive for players to seek off-site assistance and other users enter the game to provide the correct answers, thus increasing the user profile of the game itself.
除脑筋急转弯之外，解谜类小游戏也在假期火了一把，比如微信上的《解救小宝》，玩家在游戏中扮演解救者的角色，可以利用手中的剪刀剪断关卡中的绳索，让悬空绑架的小宝可以安全坠地逃出门外。
In addition to mind-twisters, puzzles also caught on during the holiday season, such as "Save Baby," a micro-letter in which players play the role of rescuers, cutting ropes with scissors so that the kidnapped treasure can escape safely from the door.
游戏设置了小宝的生命值系统，在商业化上，生命用光之后玩家可以观看激励广告进行补充，或者等待时间自动恢复，在游戏的主界面和闯关成功后的等待界面中，都增加了其他小游戏的推广露出以及推荐位广告，通过不同产品之间的导量换量带来收入。
The game set up the life value system of Xiaobao, in the commercialization, players can watch after the life is used up to supplement, or wait time automatically restore, in the game's main interface and after the success of the waiting interface, increased the promotion of other small games and recommended bit advertising, through different product derivative to generate revenue.
“今年的爆款做得比较好，主要是品类选择上，这种益智类的小游戏男女老少都可以玩，去年的话主要偏向存量类的游戏，用户思路没有这么好；另外赶上这个特殊事件，像《我不是猪头》还有头条在推的《脑洞大师》都比较爆，但其实以前都有过玩法原型，今年表现这么好，很大一部分原因还是全民宅在家里，游戏的年龄受众比较广。
"This year's explosion has been good, mainly in the category of categories, this kind of puzzle game men, women and children can play, last year mainly to the stock of games, users are not so good, but in addition to this special event, such as" I'm not Pig's Head "and" Master Brain Hole.
”游点好玩发行负责人廖帅说。
"said Liu Shuai, director of playful distribution at the resort.
据廖帅介绍，游点好玩的用户数据相比平时大增50%，整体收入比平时上涨了大约30%，他们的产品平时的主要用户群是低龄用户，因此周末的数据会好一些，目前的话基本天天都可以达到以往周末的水平。
Liao said the figures showed a 50 percent increase in the number of entertaining users and a 30 percent increase in overall revenue. The average user group was young, so the weekend figures would be better.
但另一方面，受疫情影响，整体的宏观经济出现下滑的态势，依靠广告赚钱的小游戏也遭到了牵连，因此，很多产品在日活、时长、留存等数据上增幅很大，却没能带来相应的收入增长。
On the other hand, because of the epidemic, the overall macroeconomic downturn and the involvement of small games that rely on advertising for money, many products have increased significantly in terms of longevity, duration and retention, but have not been able to generate commensurate income growth.
“疫情期间，整个广告投放市场都不太好，因为大部分行业都不太好，投放广告的广告主也少，所以在收入端虽然有点增长，但幅度不大，尤其在微信小游戏的平台上，一来微信本身的广告规模体量就不是很大，广点通的广告比穿山甲效果要差一些，二来微信是去中心化的平台，游戏买量导量的成本比头条、vivo、OPPO等平台更高。
"During the epidemic, the entire advertising market was not very good because most industries were not good and there were fewer advertisers, so there was a slight increase, but not much, especially on the micro-gaming platform. Wide-area ads were less effective than pangolins.
”廖帅表示。
"said Liao.
相比受广告市场影响的全民向小游戏，棋牌游戏在这个春节假期的收入更为可观，一位棋牌游戏制作公司的负责人对燃财经表示，这段时间用户规模暴增，甚至不用地方代理去推广，很多用户自发前来，官方直充渠道的收入大涨，春节单月的收入和利润都比过去最好的时候翻了一倍不止。
Chess games are much more lucrative this spring holiday than the ad-market-influenced popular game, where users have surged so much that they don't even use local agents to promote them, many users come spontaneously, official revenue has soared and Spring Festival revenues and profits have more than doubled in a single month from their best days in the past.
“小游戏行业目前来看就是益智类游戏爆发了，社交益智类，如《我不是猪头》日新增过百万，这是微信渠道，APP市场也有所增加，但整体涨幅不如微信渠道，虽然是个短期红利，但长期影响如何还不好说，需要具体去分析。
"The small game industry is now looking at the puzzle game explosion, social intelligence, such as" I am not pig head "added million, this is a micro-channel, APP market has increased, but the overall increase is not as small as the micro channel, although it is a short-term dividend, but the long-term impact is difficult to say needs specific analysis.
”三月互娱CEO卞海峰说。
Bian Haifeng, CEO of STEP, said in March.
爆款小游戏的制造方法如何抓住机会，将短期红利的雪球滚起来，在疫情过去之后也能持续受益，是摆在小游戏行业面前的一个重要问题。
How to seize the opportunity to make the small game, short-term dividend snowball rolling, in the aftermath of the epidemic can also continue to benefit, is a small game industry in front of an important issue.
《我不是猪头》的制作方有点意思CEO黄家隆认为，本来春节对于游戏行业就是一个小爆发期，虽然此次疫情导致假期延长，但整个大盘的用户是有限的，用户时间是有限的，头部公司及头部产品这个时候受益最大，对于小游戏公司来说，只不过稍微延长了成为爆款的窗口期，要抓住这个机会，需要在平日里就积累产品和运营能力。
Chief Executive Huang Jialong believes that the Spring Festival is a small outbreak for the game industry, although the epidemic led to extended holidays, users time is limited, head companies and head products benefited the most this time, for small game companies, just a little longer to become the window to seize the opportunity, the need to accumulate products and operational capacity on weekdays.
“有点意思是从2019年2月份才开始做小游戏，直到9月份才摸到了一些门道。
"It's a bit of a gaming experience that started in February 2019 and didn't get anywhere until September.
”黄家隆坦言。
"said Huang.
在这一年多的摸索中，他们逐渐总结出一些有效的经验，比如在游戏的开发设计阶段一定要注重游戏开始后的一分钟，需要让用户在一分钟内了解产品，获得反馈并认可游戏，再比如提前就为游戏的爆发做好准备。
Over the course of the year, they have come up with some useful lessons, such as making sure to focus on the first minute after the game starts in the design phase of game development, requiring users to understand the product in less than a minute, get feedback and endorse the game, and, for example, prepare for a game outburst well in advance.
在小游戏行业，一款产品爆发后面临的最大挑战是竞品，由于产品的技术要求简单，不存在技术壁垒，因此需要在运营上多下功夫，比如植入养成系统和利用社交排行榜，养成能让用户直观看到自己在游戏内的成就，在出现高相似度竞品时不会选择跳槽，排行榜同理。
In the small game industry, the biggest challenge after a product erupts is competition. Because of its simple technical requirements and the absence of technical barriers, it requires a lot of operational effort, such as embedding systems and using social charts to develop a way for users to visualize their achievements in the game.
这只是前置准备，而技术支持和运营支持，对于一款成功的小游戏也是必不可少的。
This is just a prep, and technical and operational support is essential to a successful little game.
“技术不到位，服务器可能承载不住这么大的用户量，游戏bug频发。
"Technology is not in place, the server may not be able to accommodate such a large number of users, the game bug frequent.
运营不到位，游戏优化不及时，用户反馈不处理，策略调控不科学，一款好的游戏也很难做成爆款。
Operations are not in place, game optimization is not timely, user feedback does not deal with, strategy control is not scientific, a good game is very difficult to make explosive money.
”黄家隆说。
"said Huang Jialong.
在《我不是猪头》这款游戏的推广过程中，有点意思非常注重运营的效果，将运营放在和产品同等重要的位置上。
In the promotion of the game "I'm not a Pig's Head," it was a bit of an emphasis on operational effectiveness, putting operations on an equal footing with the product.
比如重要的数据指标是5分钟级别，游戏调整后可以在5分钟内看到影响，其他数据则都是小时内监控。
For example, the key indicator is a 5-minute level, with the game adjusted to see impact in five minutes and all other data monitored within hours.
图 / 视觉中国“我们有套数据监控系统，数据指标有200多项，非常方便我们做产品运营。
Graph / Vision China "We have a data monitoring system with more than 200 indicators, which is very convenient for us to do product operation.
”黄家隆说。
"said Huang Jialong.
据他介绍，《我不是猪头》早在12月中旬就开发好了，一开始的数据并不具备大推和爆款迹象，后来通过用户行为分析、数据周期分析、产品品质调优等，逐步优化后，产品的数据模型具备了一些条件，于是他们决定在春节大推这款游戏。
"I'm not a Pig's Head" was developed as early as mid-December, and the data didn't start with a big push or bang, he said. Later, the data model was optimized through user behavior analysis, data cycle analysis and quality control, so they decided to push the game during Spring Festival.
一月份，市场上就出现了和《我不是猪头》同类型的游戏，当时有点意思内部又开了几次会，研究和预估用户数据，对收入模型进行分析，制定了春节前后的计划，凭借着不错的游戏品质，和比较全面的数据调优，加上前期全方面的推广准备，包括MP投放、矩阵量、私域流量、跨平台推广等，《我不是猪头》在最高峰达到千万DAU。
In January, the same type of game as "I'm Not a Pig's Head" appeared on the market. There were a few more meetings to study and estimate user data, analysis of revenue models, planning for the Spring Festival, with good game quality and comprehensive data tuning, plus upfront promotion including MP input, matrix, private domain traffic, cross-platform promotion, etc.
这超出了黄家隆的预料，“当时我们评估高峰在400-500万DAU，峰值之后稳定在200-300万DAU，因此服务器是按照600万DAU和小时活跃最高100万搭建的，没想到各翻了一番，虽然当时我们不到3小时就完成了千万承载的升配，但还是不够用，服务器承载过度或多或少对产品的成长性产生了影响，同时大量的数据统计直接挤爆了运营监控的服务器，因此也度过了两天数据摸黑的日子，这对希望通过观察数据调整策略的我们来说非常被动”。
This was beyond Huang's expectation. "When we assessed the peak at 4-5 million DAU, then stabilized at 2-3 million DAU after peak, the server was built according to DAU 6 million and hours active up to 1 million.
有点意思旗下的产品目前高度依赖数据监控系统，在运营和投放上，公司并没有对疫情做出提前的预估和响应，而是在实时的数据监控下调整产品策略，这主要得益于一个叫AI行为策略的控制和数据监控功能：提前定下很多不同维度来划分不同行为特征的用户，并将用户自动分配到不同的策略下，每个档位都有数据监控，包含当日流进、当日流出、升档流进、降档流进、升档流出、降档流出，并实现小时进出环比等。
The company does not anticipate and respond to the epidemic, but adjusts its product strategy with real-time data monitoring, thanks to a control and data monitoring function called AI behavior strategy: many different dimensions are set up in advance and users are automatically assigned to different policies.
“这个我们用了三个月时间，经过六七个大版本更改，几乎整个团队60%的人都参与其中，最终给我们带来了极大的便利，在《我不是猪头》这个产品上发挥了巨大作用。
"It took us three months, six or seven big changes, and almost 60 percent of the team was involved, and it was a huge boon to us," he said.
”黄家隆表示。
Mr Wong said.
爆款的诞生一般都有运气成分，但起决定作用的还是本身的品质和迭代，这需要技术和运营能力的强有力支持，换句话说，需要在平日里的积累准备，然后才能在关键时刻抓住机会。
The birth of a bomb usually has a lucky element, but it is the quality and iteration itself that matters, which requires strong technical and operational support, in other words, a built-up preparation during the day before the opportunity can be seized at a critical moment.
先修炼内功，再顺势起飞疫情带来了困难，也隐藏着机遇，但机遇也意味着新的挑战。
First practice internal work, then homeopathic take-off epidemic brought difficulties, but also hidden opportunities, but opportunities also mean new challenges.
目前，小游戏各类数据虽然有所增长，但整个经济受到影响，靠广告变现的小游戏也不是孤岛，对于从业者来说，相比收入大涨，这更是一个获得锻炼的机会，从产品、运营、投放等方面去总结更高承载规模下的高效运作办法，同时让一些已有的问题暴露出来。
At present, the growth of all kinds of data, but the economy as a whole is affected, the small games realized through advertising are not isolated islands, and it is an opportunity for workers to get exercise from the product, operation, delivery and other aspects of the efficient operation of higher load scale, while exposing some of the existing problems.
“首先是对小游戏的理解是否到位，很多制作方都是从传统游戏过渡来的，比如前两年因为版号的问题大家都过得不太好，可能觉得不需要版号就靠广告收入会是一波机会，纷纷入场，但没有很好理解怎么去做广告收入，实际上传统的付费游戏和现在的广告游戏本质上是有区别的。
"The first is whether the understanding of small games is in place, and many producers are transitioning from traditional games. For example, in the last two years we've all had a bad time with ad money without a version number.
”游点好玩发行负责人廖帅表示。
Liao Shuai, director of playful distribution at the resort.
廖帅举了个例子，游点好玩在微信平台上做的是买卖量的模式，产品的导出效率比较高，通过把用户导出去，让一个用户玩多款的游戏，这样就能降低用户成本，但对很多传统游戏公司来说，好不容易进来的用户再导出去是一种不可理解的行为。
Liao handsome gives an example, what swim dot fun does on micromail platform is buying and selling pattern, product derivation efficiency is high, by guiding user, let a user play many kinds of game, this can reduce user cost, but for many traditional game companies, hard-to-come users re-introduction is an incomprehensible behavior.
“小游戏的本质是跳板，是为了把用户导向更精准的游戏和电商等，促使他们去消费，从而产生更大的商业价值。
"The nature of small games is a springboard, to guide users to more precise games and electronic commerce, to promote their consumption, and thus produce greater commercial value.
”卞海峰也基本持同样的观点。
Bian Haifeng basically shares that view.
在这个逻辑下，小游戏的核心竞争力非常简单，即简单易上手的游戏设计，让更多人能快速进入游戏，并在之后的游戏设计中产生粘性，进而把用户导流出去。
In this logic, the core competitiveness of small games is very simple, that is, easy-to-use game design, so that more people can quickly into the game, and later in the design of the game to create sticky, so that users flow out.
卞海峰认为，小游戏爆款的核心就是由简入繁的过程把握，这个很多策划拿捏不好，总按自己的感觉做游戏，没考虑小白玩家，一定要做让白痴都能玩的游戏，可以在后期增加深度，前期一定要简单。
Bian Haifeng thinks that the core of the small game explosion is to grasp the process from simple to complex. This is a lot of planning is not good, always play according to their own feeling, do not consider small white players, must make idiots can play the game, can increase depth in the later stage, must be simple.
这也是全民向的益智类游戏爆发的原因，爆款小游戏的首要特征，就是具有普适性，玩法易上手，操作简单，容易通过游戏获得一定的成就感，这样的小游戏才能广泛推广，才可能拥有大量的用户。
This is also the cause of the explosion of popular puzzle game, the main characteristics of explosive money game, is universal, easy to play, easy to operate, easy to get a sense of accomplishment through the game, so that the game can be widely promoted, a large number of users.
“比起收入，我觉得这次疫情对行业的影响更大的一点是，它可能把一些非游戏用户转换成游戏用户，长期来说还是会有帮助的，很多小游戏本身就是针对那种非核心的游戏玩家，他不是重度的，就是可能坐地铁或休息的几分钟时间玩，这次疫情让他们有时间能够接触到这种品类的游戏，算是用户的积累。
"One of the things that I think this epidemic is having more impact on the industry than income is that it might turn some non-game users into game users and help in the long run. A lot of the small games themselves are for non-core gamers who are either heavy or may take a few minutes on the subway or rest.
”廖帅说。
"said Liao.
用户大幅增长，这是疫情带来的机遇，但危机也在于此，卞海峰认为，目前来看最大的不确定性就是2020年广告市场的变化，这个会对所有休闲游戏产生巨大的影响，应对的话可以考虑付费和海外，以防止广告市场整体崩塌造成休闲游戏广告回不来本。
Bian believes that the biggest uncertainty right now is the change in the advertising market in 2020, which will have a huge impact on all leisure games.If you deal with that, consider paying and overseas to prevent the overall collapse of the advertising market from causing advertising to fail.
而当下，还是需要打磨产品，扎实运营，留住用户，虽然目前投放成本低，广告收益也低，但如果长期留存够，就可以熬到广告收益提升的那天。
And now, still need to polish products, solid operation, to retain users, although the current cost of investment, advertising revenue is low, but if long enough, can endure until the day advertising revenue rise.
图 / 视觉中国“现在的情况收入也不是无法改善，关键要顺应形势，从渠道来说，微信还是第一，第二的话是OPPO，然后是手Q、vivo，可能下一个最好的是头条，要尽量研究不同平台的投放特点和成本构成，选对平台是一方面，另外要做好投放，现在赶制游戏肯定是来不及了。
/ [^ # 39 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105] / n. The key is to adapt to the situation. From the channel point of view, micromail is number one, OPPO comes second, maybe hand Q, vivo.
”廖帅说。
"said Liao.
他给的建议是，如果产品数据好，现在外面又有流量，买量价格也便宜，就可以放心大胆去买量，抓住最后一波红利，虽然少赚一点，但用户量会暴增，未来的商业变现能力更强。
He advised that if product data were good and traffic was now available outside and the purchase price was cheap, one could go ahead and buy as much as he could to capture the final dividend and, while earning less, there would be a surge in the number of users and greater commercial liquidity in the future.
而在投放上，要关注投放素材的准备和投放人员的把控，最核心的就是投放手，在控价和数据监测上做好，能及时反馈，就不会有太大问题，比如要思考目标人群是谁，他们什么时候在线，做到精准投放。
And in the release, we should pay attention to the preparation of materials and the release of personnel control, the most important thing is to put hands, in price control and data monitoring, timely feedback, there will be no major problems, such as to think about who the target audience is, when they are online, and when to deliver it accurately.
廖帅、黄家隆、卞海峰都觉得，目前还看不出来疫情究竟会给行业带来怎样的变化，但是肯定会加速行业的发展，洗牌和崛起往往只需要一个机会，但机会只留给有准备的人，修炼好内功，总有借势起飞的那一天。
Liu Shuai, Huang Jialong and Bian Haifeng felt that it was not yet clear what changes the epidemic would bring to the industry, but it would certainly accelerate the industry.
