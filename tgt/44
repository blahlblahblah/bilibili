在疫情防控的持续压力下，口罩的供给，尤其是防疫一线的供给情况依然紧绷。
Under the continuous pressure of epidemic prevention and control, the supply of masks, especially the epidemic prevention front, remains tight.
这背后既有制约企业生产的原料问题，民众也存在过度追求N95等专业口罩的误区，更有人借机囤积居奇，乃至造假售假。
This has restricted the production of raw materials, the public also excessive pursuit of N95 and other professional masks, and some people use the opportunity to hoard strange, even fake sales.

The full text - 3748 words - will take about 5.5 minutes to read. It sold out in a convenience store near the mouth of Beijing's magnets.
新京报见习记者 吴淋姝 摄近期，北京丰台区市场监管局开出了一份重磅罚单：一家药店将进价200元每盒的N95口罩卖到了850元的高价，被罚款300万元。
Shu Shu, an internship reporter for the Beijing News, recently issued a heavy ticket: A pharmacy fined $3 million for selling N95 masks for $200 a box.
在社交媒体和视频网站上，许多网友分享了自己的见闻，一只口罩卖出50元乃至100元的现象屡见不鲜。
On social media and video sites, many netizens have shared what they have seen and heard. It is not uncommon for a mask to sell for 50 yuan or even 100 yuan.
1月23日，工信部部长苗圩在天津调研口罩、消毒除菌用品等企业生产情况时透露，我国口罩最大产能是每天2000多万只，在30多家企业复产的情况下，产量已经恢复到一天800万只以上。
On January 23, Miao Wei Minister of the Ministry of Industry and Communications revealed in Tianjin that the maximum production capacity of masks was over 20 million per day. With the resumption of production by more than 30 enterprises, the output had recovered to more than 8 million a day.
不过，在疫情防控的持续压力下，口罩的供给，尤其是防疫一线的供给情况依然紧绷。
However, under the continuous pressure of disease prevention and control, the supply of masks, especially the first line of immunization, remained tight.
这背后既有制约企业生产的原料问题，民众也存在过度追求N95等专业口罩的误区，更有人借机囤积居奇，乃至造假售假。
This has restricted the production of raw materials, the public also excessive pursuit of N95 and other professional masks, and some people use the opportunity to hoard strange, even fake sales.
━━━━━销售端：十天销量超过过去数年总和生产端：原料价格一天上涨一成，不惜亏本生产医药零售企业深圳海王星辰在全国拥有2800多家连锁药房，分布在全国74个一、二线城市。
2007-9-19 19: 23 Ten days of more than the sum of the past few years total production: raw material prices rose by 10 percent a day, at a loss to produce Shenzhen Sea Wang Xing, a pharmaceutical retailer with more than 2,800 chain pharmacies in 74 first- or second-tier cities across the country.
公司市场部总监刘承龙告诉新京报记者，从1月19日到1月28日这十天时间里，海王星辰的口罩销售量已经超过过去好几年的总和。
Liu Chenglong, the company's marketing director, told the Beijing News that during the 10-day period from January 19 to January 28, more masks were sold than in the past few years combined.
市民对抗病毒药品、消杀用品的需求量也越来越大。
The demand for antiviral drugs and antiseptic products is also increasing.
公司整个春节都没有休假，到处寻找货源，现在已经在联系日本、韩国的生产企业，哪怕进价更高，也要尽力保证供给。
The company did not take the entire Spring Festival holiday, looking for supplies everywhere, and is now in contact with Japanese, Korean manufacturers, even if the price is higher, to ensure the supply.
新京报记者近日走访了北京朝阳区的多家便利店后发现，柜台里的口罩基本上都销售一空，只剩下一些普通的棉口罩。
A recent visit to convenience stores in Beijing's Chaoyang district revealed that the counters had sold out of masks, leaving only a few plain cotton masks.
店员表示，店内的消毒液等消杀用品也早已脱销。
The shop assistant said that the disinfectant and other disinfectant supplies in the store had already been sold out.
一位本地居民告诉记者1月28日下午，某电商平台有一批医用外科口罩到货，自己准时进入网页“开抢”，却发现服务器已经不堪重负宕机了。
A local resident told reporters on January 28 afternoon that a group of medical surgical masks arrived on a commercial platform and entered the site "to rob," only to find that the server was already overwhelmed.
等到网页访问恢复，这批口罩已经销售一空。
By the time the visit resumed, the masks had been sold out.
刘承龙告诉新京报记者，当下“一罩难求”的现象，一是因为它从“非必需品”变成了“必需品”。
Liu Chenglong told the Beijing News that the current phenomenon of "hard to get," one is because it has changed from "non-essentials" to "necessities."
原先口罩在生活中的使用场景并不多，而现在每个人出门都要用到，有些城市甚至不戴口罩就不允许坐地铁坐公交，民众需求量激增。
The use of face masks in life is not many, but now everyone needs to go out, some cities even do not wear masks on the subway to allow public transport, the demand has surged.
二是因为口罩本身也是一个易耗品。
Second, the mask itself is a consumable.
一次性的口罩一般用上三四小时之后就需要更换了，而现在有些人不得不一副口罩戴三四天，因为买不到新的口罩。
Disposable masks usually take three to four hours to replace, and now some people have to wear a mask for three or four days because they can't buy new ones.
位于四川成都的恒明科技是恒明医疗旗下的一家生产企业。
Heng Ming Technology, based in Chengdu, Sichuan, is a manufacturer under the auspices of Hengming Medical Corporation.
公司总经理廖佳明1月28日接受新京报记者采访时表示，目前生产线的极限产量是每天12万只，但是波动很大，正常情况下每天能生产8-10万只。
In an interview with the Beijing News on January 28, Liao Jia Ming, general manager of the company, told the Beijing News on January 28 that the current production line has a production ceiling of 120,000 units per day but fluctuates so much that it can normally produce between 80,000 and 100,000 a day.
现在最担心的问题就是机器长时间满负荷运作容易出问题。
The biggest concern now is that machines run at full capacity for long periods of time.
廖佳明表示，人可以轮换，但是机器是要一直工作着，昨天（1月27日）晚上刚刚抢修了两个小时，现在他派了三个技术人员，专门盯着机器的运行。
Mr. Liao says people can rotate, but the machines have to work all the time. Yesterday evening, January 27, after a two-hour rush, he sent three technicians to keep an eye on the machine.
廖佳明告诉新京报记者，从年三十到今天，整体上原材料价格上涨超过40%，基本上保持着每天10%的增速。
Liao told the Beijing News that overall raw material prices have risen by more than 40 percent since the mid-thirties, basically at a rate of 10 percent a day.
不过，也有特别仗义的供应商不但没有涨价，还给自己降价，因为对方知道自己也不挣钱——生产出来的口罩要么捐献了，要么供应给政府分配。
But suppliers with a special paramountcy not only did not raise prices, but also cut their own prices, knowing they would not make money - producing masks that were either donated or supplied to the government for distribution.
廖佳明告诉新京报记者，明后天公司还会向湖北武汉防疫一线再捐赠一车物资。
Liao told the Beijing News that the company will donate another load of materials to Wuhan cordon sanitaire in Hubei Province the day after tomorrow.
涨价之外，另一个问题是原材料的质量难以保证。
In addition to price increases, another problem is the quality of raw materials is difficult to guarantee.
廖佳明表示，在紧张的供给下，有些供应商提供的原材料，比如口罩上用来挂住耳朵的带子，是一些过去没有卖掉的库存原料，不一定符合生产标准。
Liao said that under tight supplies, raw materials supplied by some suppliers, such as masks used to hold ears, were stock materials that had not been sold in the past and did not necessarily meet production standards.
“现在口罩这么紧缺，你也不能不用，我们就想方设法给用上了。
"You don't have to use them now because they are so scarce that we have to try to use them.
”廖佳明告诉记者，但是有时候这些带子就很容易被机器扯断，一个快做好的口罩就成了废品。
But sometimes the tape can easily be ripped off by a machine, and a soon-to-be-made mask becomes waste, Liao told reporters.
“我们的工人看着都想哭。
"Our workers seem to be crying.
”廖佳明表示，“我们觉得一个口罩就保护了一个人，这样浪费了几千个口罩，很心痛。
"We feel like a mask protects a person, wasting thousands of masks," says Liao.
”━━━━━暴利引发假冒N95口罩生产关于口罩价格上涨的问题，刘承龙表示，作为一个“药店人”，他理解口罩价格的合理上涨，但对于一个原本十块钱的口罩要卖到50乃至100块钱，他直言这是“乱涨价”。
2007-09-25 09: 55 (BIG BREAKERS BENEFICIALS) Producing fake N95 masks As a "druggist," Liu said he understood the reasonable increase in the price of masks, but called them "wild price increases" for a ten-dollar mask for 50 or 100 yuan.
他表示，由于春节期间本身人力物力成本就有上扬，再加上新型冠状病毒这一外部原因，渠道采购回来的成本已经比原来要高出一些，所以现实中的售价也不得不相应上调。
He said that because of the rising human and material costs during the Spring Festival, coupled with the external cause of the new coronavirus, the cost of procurement is higher than before, so real-life prices have to be increased accordingly.
但是有些人会借助大家的恐慌，蓄意造谣，让供求关系更加紧张。
But some people will take advantage of the panic, deliberately false rumors, to make supply and demand relations more tense.
刘承龙告诉新京报记者，口罩有很多类型，N95的防护效果确实会更好，所以是大家都想买到的口罩，但是这种口罩的专业属性比较强，以前都是只有医务人员或者特殊工作环境下的人员才需要用到，它的产量比较少，库存量也不多，现在是远远满足不了大众的需求。
Liu told the Beijing News that there are many types of face masks, N95 protection will indeed be better, so people want to buy a mask, but the professional nature of this mask is only needed by medical staff or staff in special work situations, its production is relatively small, inventory is not large enough to meet the needs of the public.
在大家用尽各种办法求购N95口罩之时，就出现了不法分子“投其所好”地伪造N95口罩，或者炒作N95口罩价格的现象。
When everyone tried their best to buy the N95 mask, there was a phenomenon of illegal people "in their favor" fake N95 mask, or speculation about the price of N95 mask.
据报道，1月23日，浙江金华的执法人员就查获了一批假口罩，多达2.5万副“3M N95口罩”均为假货，生产假货的黑作坊没有任何消毒杀菌设备，员工都是徒手进行包装。
On January 23, law enforcement officials in Jinhua, Zhejiang Province, seized a batch of fake masks. Up to 25,000 copies of the 3M N95 mask were fake.
新京报记者调查发现，在暴利的诱惑下，确实有工厂铤而走险生产假冒品牌口罩。
The Beijing News reporter survey found that under the temptation of windfall profits, factories did take the risk of producing fake brand masks.
在浙江义乌，有口罩代加工厂表示可按记者提供的品牌要求对口罩进行包装，“什么样的格式你可以发过来，按照你的定做。
In Yiwu, Zhejiang, mask processing plant said that according to the brand requirements provided by the reporter to the mask packaging, "what format you can send, according to your custom.
”虽然工厂没有资质，却依然号称能生产医用标准口罩。
Despite its lack of qualifications, the factory claims to be able to produce medical standard masks.
对于医用口罩需要的标示，对方表示“那都有的”。
To the mark that medical mask needs, the other side says "that all have."
廖佳明所在的恒明科技生产的，是一次性医用口罩。
Liao Jiaming's Hengming Technology produces disposable medical masks.
他告诉新京报记者，与医用外科口罩相比，主要差别是对血液的防护，前者不能进手术室，后者是可以进手术室的，但是对于一般人的日常防护来说，都是可以的。
He told the Beijing News that the main difference compared to medical surgical masks was blood protection, the former could not go into the operating room, the latter into the operating room, but for ordinary people's daily protection, it was OK.
口罩防护的有效材料都是熔喷布，一次性医用口罩的过滤指标是99%，而N95口罩的过滤指标是99.5%，只差0.5个百分点，都能够起到比较好的防护作用。
The effective material for mask protection is spray cloth. The filter index of disposable medical mask is 99%, and that of N95 mask is 99.5%, which is only 0.5 percentage point short.
廖佳明表示，对于普通人来说，最好的防护就是少出门。
For ordinary people, the best protection is to go out less, says Liao.
在当前口罩紧张的环境下，这样也能为一线的工作人员留出更多的口罩。
In the current tense environment of masks, this will also allow more frontline staff to save more masks.
对于来门店购买N95口罩的用户，海王星辰连锁药房的工作人员都会告诉他们，如果不是到医院去，如果不是感染者，也没有感冒或者肺炎之类的疾病，其实并不必需N95口罩。
For customers who come to the store to buy N95 masks, they are told that N95 masks are not necessary if they do not go to the hospital, if they are not infected or have no illnesses such as colds or pneumonia.
“对于日常生活来说，无论是外科口罩，还是棉口罩、纸口罩，只要是口罩，就比没口罩好。
"For daily life, whether surgical mask, cotton mask, paper mask, as long as it is a mask, is better than no mask.
”刘承龙说道，作为药店，不仅要卖药，也要给消费者传递正确的健康观念。
As a drugstore, he says, it's not just about selling drugs, it's also about getting the right health message across to consumers.
刘承龙表示，现在全国各大城市为了防疫，采取了比较严格的交通管制措施，很多高速公路都在限行，这也在一定程度上影响了物资运输的进度。
Liu said that now the major cities in China to epidemic prevention, the adoption of more stringent traffic control measures, many highways are restricted, which also has a certain impact on the progress of goods transport.
希望未来几天恢复陆运海运以后，能够为市民尽快补上货。
It is hoped that after the resumption of land and sea transport in the next few days, the public can restock.
━━━━━各地工信部门积极组织生产调运，武汉前线物资依然“紧平衡”廖佳明所说的一线，主要是指湖北武汉这样疫情严重的地区，其次还有本地进行检测和排查的工作人员。
--2008.09.19 The Wuhan frontline materials are still "in a tight balance," according to Liao Jiaming, referring mainly to the worst-hit areas such as Wuhan, Hubei Province, and secondly, to local staff engaged in testing and checking.
“各大医院的医护人员，双流机场，成都东站，高速公路出口的工作人员，执行任务的民警，等等。
"Major hospitals of medical personnel, Shuangliu airport, Chengdu East Station, highway exits staff, police on mission, and so on.
”廖佳明说道，据他了解，有些执行排查任务的民警都只能在没有保护的条件下工作。
Mr. Liao said he understands that some civilian police carrying out screening tasks are working without protection.
廖佳明建议，在当下，口罩这样的防疫物资应该由国家统一调配，“因为只有国家是最知道哪里最需要这些物资的。
At the moment, says Liao, vaccines like masks should be distributed centrally by the state, "because only the country knows best where they are most needed."
”国家部委和各省市的物资调运，也正在紧锣密鼓地进行之中。
The transfer of goods from state ministries and provinces and municipalities is also in full swing.
1月26晚上23:00，由江苏省承担调配的5000件防护服、三万箱消毒水通过陆路抵达武汉。
At 2300 hours on January 26, 5,000 protective suits and 30,000 boxes of disinfectant water were delivered overland to Wuhan under Jiangsu province.
1月27日晚上20:10，工信部从青岛紧急调拨的2万副医用护目镜、5千个医用隔离面罩通过空运到达武汉。
January 27, 20: 10 p.m., the Ministry of Industry and Communications emergency transfer from Qingdao 20, 000 medical goggles, 5,000 medical isolation mask by air to Wuhan.
各省份主管部门的通报显示，企业加班加点生产的防疫物资正在源源不断地流向武汉。
Authorities in the provinces reported that enterprises are working overtime to produce epidemic prevention materials are flowing into Wuhan.
1月27日，工信部消费品工业司副司长曹学军在接受新京报采访时表示，疫情联防联控工作机制成立后，工信部作为物资保障组组长单位，已经动员全国工信系统组织各生产企业千方百计复工复产，建立国家防控物资临时储备制度，对重点生产企业的物资直接调配，引导电商平台控价、控流、合理投放，千方百计保证湖北防控物资的需求。
In an interview with the Beijing News on January 27, Cao Xuejun, deputy director of the consumer goods industry department of the Ministry of Industry and Communications, told the Beijing News that after the establishment of the joint epidemic prevention and control mechanism, the Ministry had mobilized all production enterprises to resume production.
某东部省份工信厅工作人员告诉新京报记者，截至1月28日的最新统计显示，该省已经有二十多家口罩生产企业复工复产，占全部企业数量的约一半。
According to the latest statistics from January 28, more than two dozen mask-producing enterprises in the eastern province have resumed production, accounting for about half of all enterprises.
从企业反映的生产困难来看，最主要问题是原料供应还不够稳定，有些原料还比较短缺。
From the enterprise reflects the production difficulty, the most important problem is that the raw material supply is not stable enough, some raw materials are still relatively short.
该工作人员表示，口罩生产是一个产业链，有些企业生产原料是自有的，复工之后还有一些库存材料可以用，但是有些企业的生产原料需要从上游企业那里采购，而这些企业可能还没有复工，就会出现原料供应的短缺。
The staff member stated that the production of masks was an industrial chain and that some enterprises had their own raw materials and some stocks were available after the resumption of work, but that some enterprises needed to procure raw materials from upstream enterprises that might not be able to resume work, resulting in shortages of raw materials.
该省工信厅也正在积极协调企业的原料采购，但是有些原料企业是在外省，协调起来也存在一些困难。
The provincial office is also actively coordinating the purchase of raw materials for enterprises, but some raw material enterprises are in the provinces, there are difficulties in coordination.
该工作人员表示，还有一些企业反映存在运输困难的情况。
According to the staff member, a number of enterprises also reported difficulties with transportation.
现在为了控制疫情蔓延，各省之间、各大城市都进行了一定程度的交通管控，这给企业生产也造成了运输上的困难。
In order to control the spread of the epidemic, some degree of traffic control is carried out between provinces and major cities, which makes it difficult for enterprises to produce.
省政府对此也高度重视，已经成立了几个工作组进行组织协调。
The provincial government also attaches great importance to this, and several working groups have been set up to coordinate.
1月28日，武汉市委书记马国强在接受媒体采访时表示，到目前为止，武汉的医用物资还处在紧平衡状态：“所谓紧平衡，即目前物资够用，但长远看，仍要加大筹措力度。
Wuhan city party secretary Ma Guoqiang said in an interview with reporters on January 28 that so far the medical supplies in Wuhan are in a tight balance.
”据人民日报报道，1月27日，武汉大学中南医院托管的发热患者定点诊疗医院武汉市七医院出现了医用防护口罩的短缺，储备已近“零库存”。
On January 27, the Wuhan Seven Hospital, a designated hospital for fever sufferers under the custody of Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital, reported a shortage of medical masks.
29日，工信部相关司局负责人在接受媒体采访时表示，恢复乃至扩大口罩产能还需要时间，除了国内的生产，工信部也在推动国际采购，以满足全国疫情防控需求。
It will take time to restore or even expand mask production capacity. In addition to domestic production, the Ministry of Industry and Communications is promoting international procurement to meet the country's epidemic prevention and control needs, the ministry said in an interview with the media.
