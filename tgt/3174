小编今天想重点聊一聊韩国在本次疫情当中病死率的问题。
Today I would like to focus on the South Korean epidemic in the case of death rates.
我们先来看两个数：韩国感染密度为738.20例/万平方公里，感染率为1429.51例/千万人口，远高于国内非湖北的各个省市。
The infection density in Korea is 738.20 cases per 10,000 square kilometers and the infection rate is 1429.51 cases per million people.
而韩国的病死率约为0.70%，低于国内非湖北的各个省市。
South Korea's fatality rate of about 0.70 percent, lower than the country's non-Hubei provinces and cities.
目前全球范围的病死率约为3.4%。
The current global fatality rate is about 3.4 per cent.
同时，小编认为，韩国能做到这一点，在医疗卫生系统发达之外，还有另外三个原因。
At the same time, Xiao believes that South Korea can do this, in addition to the health system developed, there are three other reasons.
首先，疫情初期就完成了对源头“新天地”教会和大邱市的圈定。
First of all, the early stage of the outbreak of the source of the "Xintiandi" Church and Daegu City delimited.
京畿道甚至“等不及也并不完全相信”该教会提供的名单，因而对其总部采取了突袭搜查行动。
Gyeonggi Province even "could not wait for and did not fully believe" the list provided by the church and carried out a raid on its headquarters.
其次，根据韩国疾病管理本部数据，在大邱疫情爆发前的2月18日，韩国累计对8923人完成了核酸检测。
Second, according to Korea's Department of Disease Control, before the Daegu outbreak on February 18, South Korea completed a total of 8,923 nucleic acid tests.
自大邱疫情爆发后约一周时间（截至2月26日早9时），又完成了近1万人的核酸检测工作。
Approximately one week after the Daegu outbreak (9 a.m. on 26 February), nearly 10,000 more nucleic acid tests have been completed.
最后，韩国的核酸检测费用10万韩元/人，约合人民币600元。
Finally, the cost of nucleic acid testing in South Korea is 100,000 won / person, about 600 yuan.
对民众来说经济压力较低，抵触情绪也就更低。
Economic stress is low, and resistance is even lower.
早发现、早诊断、还有治疗和隔离，这是最有效、最原始的防控办法。
Early detection, early diagnosis, treatment and isolation are the most effective and original methods of control.
六、伊朗仍处于“攻坚战”阶段图7伊朗开始省际间“软性隔离”，多个省份宣布禁止非本省机动车和人员进入。
Iran Still in the Struggle Stage Figure 7: Iran Begins "Soft Isolation" among Provinces, with a number of provinces declaring a ban on motor vehicles and persons outside the province.
伊朗首都德黑兰将装备8个针对疫情的危机避难所，共配有600个隔离床位，目前已经完成了其中3处地点的装备，其余5处将尽快完成。
Tehran, Iran's capital, will be equipped with eight crisis shelters for the epidemic, with a total of 600 beds, three of which have now been equipped and the remaining five will be completed as soon as possible.
据当地媒体报道，德黑兰近63％的居民没有足够的卫生和医疗用品。
According to local media reports, nearly 63 per cent of Tehran's residents lack adequate sanitation and medical supplies.
