我心想，先送给武汉的医院，武汉安全了全国就安全了；再送给各地的医院，医生安全了，我们就安全。
I thought, first sent to Wuhan hospital, Wuhan safe throughout the country; and then to the hospitals everywhere, doctors are safe, we are safe.
要不然，我们戴了口罩也没用。
Otherwise, it would be useless for us to wear a mask.
口述、图片 | 周朝恩整理 | 王 嫱 方雨斌我是80后宁波人，2003年SARS爆发那年，我正好从浙江大学计算机科学与技术学院本科毕业。
Oral, Photo & # 160; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
当时SARS对我的影响并不大，而那一年我就在上海闵行找到一份和手机行业相关的工作。
SARS had little impact on me at the time, and that year I found a job in Minhang, Shanghai, related to the mobile phone industry.
我2009年创立了上海艾麒信息科技有限公司，主要做手机视频、录频和P图相关的App。
I founded Shanghai Ai-ki Information Technology Co. Ltd. in 2009, mainly to do mobile video, video and P-chart-related App.
其中，乐秀视频编辑器，已经在全球有了5亿用户。
Among them, the music show video editor, already has 500 million users in the world.
大学毕业17年来，我一直在上海工作生活，也在这里成家立业，老婆张力是个川妹子，也是学计算机的。
After 17 years of college, I have been working and living in Shanghai, where I have started my own family and career.
可以说，闵行就像我俩的第二故乡。
Minhang is, so to speak, our second home.
武汉封城前，10万定金做口罩按照惯例，我们公司工作到腊月二十九就放假了。
Wuhan before the closure of the city, 100,000 deposit as a mask in accordance with the usual practice, our company to work until the 29th holiday on the holiday.
1月22日腊月二十八那天，有同事向我这个总经理抱怨，说现在外面口罩很难买到。
On January 28th, a colleague complained to my general manager that it was difficult to buy a mask outside now.
而就在2天前的1月20日，钟南山在电视里说武汉出现的新型冠状病毒肺炎存在人传人的现象，所以求生欲很强的小伙伴们到处开始买口罩。
Just two days ago on January 20, Zhong Nan Shan said on television that the new coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan has a human-to-human phenomenon, so the survival of the small partners began to buy masks everywhere.
药店卖空了，电商不发货了……我想，在上海这样的国际大都市，买口罩都那么难，估计其他地方就更不容易了。
The drugstore is short, the electrician does not deliver... I think, in an international metropolis like Shanghai, buying masks is so difficult, I guess other places are even harder.
当天回到家，我就和老婆说起这事。
When I got home that day, I told my wife about it.
我们俩越聊越觉得情况不太妙，应该做点什么。
The more we talked, the worse things got. Something we should do.
武汉宣布封城是第二天（1月23日）的事，我们在前一天晚上讨论时就担心当地口罩短缺，所以决定要找厂家订购一批口罩捐给武汉。
Wuhan announced that the city is the next day (January 23), we discussed the previous night worried about the shortage of local masks, so decided to ask manufacturers to order a batch of masks donated to Wuhan.
因为快过年了，大多数口罩生产厂都处于停产状态。
Most of the mask factories are out of production because of the approaching New Year.
我们公司所在的莘庄工业区莘闵留学生创业园，企服部的许华老师十分热心，帮忙介绍了在金山张堰镇工业区的升欣（上海）纺织品科技有限公司。
Our company located in Xinzhuang industrial area Sheng Min International Student Venture Park, enterprise Hattori teachers very warm-hearted, to help in the Jinshan Zhang Yan Town Industrial Zone Shengxin (Shanghai) Textile Technology Co. Ltd.
这家公司的总经理原本就在犹豫，是否要过年加班生产口罩，但没有订单，他也不敢贸然留下工人。
The general manager of the company was hesitant to produce masks for the Lunar New Year, but without an order, he did not dare to leave the workers behind.
我马上打给对方10万元作为定金，订购30万只口罩。
I immediately called the other party 100,000 yuan as a deposit, ordered 300,000 masks.
对方听到我们是要给医院送口罩，主动给了我们成本价。
The other side heard that we were going to send a mask to the hospital and offered us a cost price.
1月24日大年三十那天，工厂开始加班加点生产口罩。
On the 30th day of January 24, the factory began to work overtime to produce masks.
30万个口罩，捐给湖北和上海最需要的人在工厂加紧生产的同时，我和老婆就根据网上的信息，给武汉的各个医院打电话。
While factories were in full swing for 300,000 masks, my wife and I phoned hospitals in Wuhan on the basis of information from the Internet.
这年头铺天盖地的网上信息，未必都准确，我们就去找了武汉当地的同事朋友介绍，最终联系到位于武汉的湖北省中医院，和那里的赵主任对接口罩的事。
This year, the innumerable online information, may not be accurate, we went to Wuhan local colleagues and friends to introduce, eventually linked to the Wuhan-based Hubei Province Chinese Hospital, and there Zhao director docking masks.
当时很多快递都停了，虽然一些快递公司有针对肺炎疫情的救援专线，但电话太忙打不进去，我们就干脆付了快递费直接发出去。
A lot of couriers stopped, and although some courier companies had special lines for pneumonia, but the calls were too busy to get through, we simply paid the courier fees and sent them directly.
1月25日大年初一，首批生产的40箱共8万只口罩从上海寄出。
On January 25, the first 40 boxes of 80, 000 masks were sent from Shanghai.
年初二，武汉的医生就用上了这批口罩。
Wuhan doctors used these masks on the second day of the year.
这一次能够那么快发货，要感谢许多方面——升欣的老板所在的跑友汇，志愿者大年初一就来金山帮忙，大家都觉得这样过节更有意义。
This time to be able to deliver goods so quickly, to thank many - Sheng Xin's boss's running friends, volunteers came to Jinshan on the first day of Jinshan to help, we all felt this holiday more meaningful.
还有武汉大学校友会的朋友、海外华侨等，也都做了好多。
There are Wuhan University Alumni Association friends, overseas Chinese, and so on, have done a lot.
第一批口罩到武汉后，武汉的医生主动把荆门、黄冈、襄阳等地的医生介绍给我们，因为这些地区物资更加短缺。
After the first batch of masks arrived in Wuhan, Wuhan doctors volunteered to introduce doctors from Jingmen, Huanggang and Xiangyang to us, because these areas are even more in short supply.
随着1月26日（大年初二）升欣被上海市经信委征用产能，工厂没有余力再为我们生产口罩，所以我们手头的口罩如何分发就更加谨慎。
With Sheng Xin requisitioned by the Shanghai Economic and Communications Commission on January 26 (the second day of the year), the factory has no spare capacity to produce masks for us, so we are more cautious about how our masks are distributed.
为了确保口罩都能送到最需要的地方，我和老婆一起筛选对接的医院和数量，微信里加了好多医院医生的群。
To make sure the masks got where they were most needed, my wife and I sifted through the number of hospitals and docked them.
都是认识的朋友介绍，或者医生介绍医生，了解了情况确实是急缺的，我们才发。
They are introduced to each other by friends, or referred to the doctor by a doctor who knows that the situation is really in short supply.
发出去的口罩，我们都要跟进到收货，发货那几天每天都要忙到凌晨1点多。
Send out the mask, we have to follow up to receive the goods, shipping that day every day until 1: 00 a.m.
我一开始一个医院发几万个，后来一万个一发，最后2000个一发。
I started out with tens of thousands of hospital rounds, then 10,000 rounds, then 2,000 rounds.
我一开始觉得30万个口罩挺多了，可很快就觉得不够捐了。
At first I thought 300,000 masks were too much, but soon I felt short of donations.
我听说上海本地医院口罩也有些紧张，就和老婆联系了位于闵行区的复旦大学附属闵行医院和上海市第五人民医院，分别送去1万只口罩。
I heard that Shanghai local hospital masks were nervous, so I contacted Min Hang Hospital, affiliated with Fudan University in Minhang District, and Shanghai's Fifth People's Hospital, respectively, and sent 10,000 masks.
我们又听说在高速公路检查体温的工作人员也缺少口罩，又给上海市交通运输局送去了2000只。
We also heard that the staff checking body temperature on the expressway lacked masks and sent 2,000 more to the Shanghai Transport Bureau.
这次过年我回过宁波老家一次，很快就回来了，大部分时间在上海，都在忙捐口罩这件事。
I went back to my hometown of Ningbo for the Spring Festival and soon came back. I spent most of my time in Shanghai donating masks.
其间，一些买不到口罩的亲戚朋友也来问我要口罩。
Meanwhile, some relatives and friends who could not buy a mask came to ask me for a mask.
我就直接告诉他们，我的口罩是工厂直接发给医院的，身边没有。
I told them straight away that my mask had been given directly to the hospital by the factory and was not around.
我心想，先送给武汉的医院，武汉安全了全国就安全了；再送给各地的医院，医生安全了，我们就安全。
I thought, first sent to Wuhan hospital, Wuhan safe throughout the country; and then to the hospitals everywhere, doctors are safe, we are safe.
要不然，我们戴了口罩也没用。
Otherwise, it would be useless for us to wear a mask.
现在，30万只口罩都送出去了，我和老婆也终于可以安心过年了。
Now that 300,000 face masks have been given away, my wife and I can finally enjoy the New Year.
