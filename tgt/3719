新冠肺炎疫情下，主流险企陷入保费下滑危机受疫情影响，3·15晚会推迟，但消费者维权的声音不会延期，保险类产品依然是投诉维权的热门话题，据中消协统计，2019年涉及汽车保险类投诉共计594件，捆绑销售车险和诱导消费者保险贷款成为投诉的热点，今年3·15前后，围绕保险产品的声讨再次掀起高潮。
In 2019, 594 auto insurance-related complaints were filed, and bundled auto sales and consumer insurance loans became the focus of complaints. Around 15 March this year, the outcry over insurance products came to a head again around March 15.
值得注意的是，今年保险业的日子并不好过，中国平安、中国人保、中国人寿、中国太保以及新华保险五大上市险企均于近期公布今年1月、2月保费收入，前两个月保费总收入6719.74亿元，同比上涨4.3%，而2月份的保费总收入1435.39亿元，环比大幅下降72.8%。
It is worth noting that the insurance industry has had a difficult year this year, with China Ping An, Chinese People's Insurance, China Life, China Pacific Life and Xinhua Insurance all reporting their premiums in January and February, with total premiums of 671,974 million yuan in the first two months, up 4.3% year-on-year.
消费者保险维权涛声依旧，新冠肺炎疫情下的保险市场市场又将有何种预期？开门红危机开门红是保险业传统销售旺季，大多数保险公司都将开门红作为全年的工作重点，为完成保费收入，集中推出优惠的保险产品。
What do you expect from the insurance market in the wake of the outbreak of the new crown pneumonia? The start of the boom is the traditional sales season for the insurance industry, most insurance companies as a priority throughout the year to complete premium income, focused on the introduction of preferential insurance products.
开门红的第一季度保费收入尤其是1月和 2月份的保费，往往占据了保险公司全年保费的很大比例。
Premiums in the first quarter, especially in January and February, tend to account for a large proportion of the premiums of insurers throughout the year.
但是今年的保险热销季却全面遇冷，目前公布的数据显示，今年前两个月，五大上市险企，中国人寿保费收入2280亿元，同比增长20.5%；中国太保保费收入909.23亿元，同比上涨1.6%；新华保险保费收入395.6亿元，同比上涨44.2%；中国人保保费收入1241.61亿元，同比下降5.13%；中国平安保费收入1893.3亿元，同比下降8.6%。
In the first two months of this year, China Life insurance premium income totaled 2288 billion yuan, up 20.5% year-on-year. China's premium income was 99.923 billion yuan, up 1.6% year-on-year.
五家上市险企三家保费上涨，两家出现下滑。
Three premiums of five listed risk companies rose and two fell.
2月份，五大上市险企的保费收入环比则出现剧烈下降。
In February, the premium income ratio of the top five listed insurance companies fell sharply.
中国人寿保费收入为345亿元，环比下降82.2%；中国太保保费收入为213.06亿元，环比下降69.4%；新华保险保费收入88.55亿元，环比下降71.2%；中国人保保费收入323.04亿元，环比下降64.8%；中国平安保费收入465.74亿元，环比下降67.4%。
The premium income of China Life was 34.5 billion yuan, 82.2 percent lower than that of the ring. China's premium income was 21.306 billion yuan, a 69.4 percent decrease; China's insurance premium income was 8,855 million yuan, a decrease of 71.2 percent.
上市险企1、2月保费收入北京某大型保险公司向中国新闻周刊称，今年保险业的开门红行情缺席主要受新冠疫情的影响，春节期间疫情暴发，险企自身面临复工延迟，银保等产品销售渠道受阻，而传统的汽车等市场低迷，拖累财险保费收入大幅下降。
The absence of a major insurance company in Beijing this year has been largely affected by the new crown epidemic, with risk companies themselves facing delays in resuming work and sales of products such as banks and banks, while traditional markets such as cars have slowed sharply, according to a major insurance company in Beijing.
业界分析称，险企今年2月保费大幅下降在意料之中，2月分是国内疫情的暴发期，举国闭门战疫，在家隔离、线上办公等使得险企业务受到最大冲击，叠加2月份的春节假期延长，险企保费收入剧烈下滑并不意外。
Industry analysts said the sharp fall in premiums in February was expected, February is the outbreak of the domestic epidemic, the country's closed-door epidemic, isolation at home, on-line work, and so on the most affected business operations, superimposed February Spring Festival extension, insurance premiums sharp decline is not surprising.
来自券商分析师的观点认为，中长期来看，新冠肺炎疫情提高了消费者对疾病的自我防范意识和对健康风险的保障意识，有助于激发健康保险的配置需求，疫情结束后，保险需求必将反弹，预计将推动保险行业迅速发展。
Analysts from brokerage firms believe that, in the medium to long term, the outbreak has raised consumer awareness of disease self-prevention and health risks, helped to stimulate the health insurance allocation needs, after the end of the epidemic, insurance demand is bound to rebound, is expected to promote rapid growth of the insurance industry.
按照正常逻辑，每次重大的疫情、灾害，必会大幅提升消费者的保险意识，保险业营收应声大幅上涨才是市场预期，但此次新冠肺炎疫情下，主流险企却同步陷入保费下滑危机。
According to normal logic, every major epidemic, disaster, will greatly enhance consumer awareness of insurance, insurance revenue is expected to rise sharply, but this time, the new crown pneumonia epidemic, mainstream insurance companies have plunged into a synchronized premium crisis.
中国新闻周刊同时发现，保险行业开门红期间的销售遇冷并不是今年首度出现。
China Newsweek also found that the sales downturn during the heyday was not the first time this year.
2018年，受原中国保监会加强保险产品及销售监管影响，尤其是134号文加强快返型保险产品监管，万能、两全等保险产品被叫停，136号文要求针对保险误导销售严查，此前连续三年保费高增长的保险行业开门红开始遇冷，第一季度行业保费收入出现负增长。
In 2018, the insurance industry, which had enjoyed three consecutive years of high premium growth, experienced negative growth in premium income in the first quarter, as the former CIRC strengthened its supervision of insurance products and sales. In particular, article 134 strengthened the supervision of fast-return insurance products.
2018年整年，保险业整体的原保险保费收入仅同比增长3.92%，创下7年来新低。
Throughout 2018, the insurance industry as a whole saw its primary premium income rise only 3.92 per cent year-on-year, a seven-year low.
2019年，寿险市场率先暴冷，当年1月份，中国平安、中国太保、中国太平寿险保费仅分别同比增长5.22%、2.89%、9.58%，结束连续三年两位数增速，度过了缺少喜庆红色的开门季。
In 2019, the life insurance market led the way. In January, Ping An, Taibao and Taiping grew by 5.22%, 2.89% and 9.58% year-on-year respectively, ending three years of double-digit growth and the lack of a festive red opening season.
上市险企寿险业务趋势2020年，中国保险业更是遭遇前所未有的压力。
In 2020, China's insurance industry is under unprecedented pressure.
分析指出，承保端来看，传统线下销售渠道受阻，代理人脱落、险企增员难，直接影响新单增长，企业延期复工等致使银代、团险渠道均受到不同程度影响；投资端上，美联储已连续两次降息或引发全球进入低利率环境，中国央行再度降息预期增强，今年全球降息范围和力度进一步加大，资产荒与信用风险上升，对保险资金投资带来压力。
At the same time, the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates twice in succession or triggered global interest rate hikes, the People's Bank of China cut interest rates again, and this year the scope and intensity of global interest rate cuts have increased, and asset shortages and credit risks have put pressure on the investment of insurance funds.
有消息称，目前部分保险公司到期资产收益率已经出现倒挂现象，今年新投资资产收益率不足5％，明显低于去年收益率水平。
Some insurance companies have now reversed their returns on maturing assets, with a yield of less than 5 per cent this year, down significantly from last year, sources said.
今年前两个月的数据也显示，寿险银保市场新单规模保费同比下降超40%，其中2月份单月新单规模保费同比下降达69%，新单规模保费降至7年来低点；财险市场上，中国人保、中国太保、中国平安2月单月保费均录得负增长，分别同比分别为-6.8%、-10.8%、-7.9%。
Figures for the first two months of the year also show that premiums for the new single-size life insurance market fell by more than 40 per cent year-on-year, with new single-scale premiums falling 69 per cent year-on-year in February and new single-scale premiums falling to a seven-year low.
开门红遇冷、新单负增长、财险业务萎缩等问题并存的保险业后市将作何表现？不过也有业界声音称，保险业通过调整资产配置，增加保险业经营韧性等途径，可以在很大程度上抵挡不利影响。
How will the insurance market fare in the future when problems of cold weather, negative new growth and shrinking insurance business coexist? But there are also industry voices that the insurance industry can largely fend off adverse effects by adjusting asset allocation and increasing the resilience of the insurance industry.
当前保险股股价已经体现了多种不利因素的影响，对于投资者来说，正是进行长期配置的好机会。
The current share price of insurance stocks has reflected the impact of a variety of adverse factors, for investors, is a good opportunity for long-term allocation.
疫情结束之后，保险业有望否极泰来，迎来收入和股价的反弹。
With the end of the epidemic, the insurance industry is likely to see a sharp rebound in revenues and share prices.
规避保险乱象与保费销售遇冷不一致的是，保险业的违规事项却呈抬头之势。
Avoiding the insurance confusion and premium sales is inconsistent with the insurance industry irregularities are on the rise.
据中国新闻周刊初步统计，银保监会官网今年1月份，针对保险业发布了2张行政处罚决定书，罚款金额75万元，地方监管部门发布了248张，罚款金额4708.6万元。
According to preliminary statistics from China News Weekly, the website of the CBRC issued two administrative penalty decisions in January, with a fine of 750,000 yuan for the insurance industry and 248 fines of 47.086 million yuan issued by local supervisory authorities.
仅在1月份，全国保险监管部门共计发布250张罚单，同比增长320.5%；罚款金额共计4783.6万元，同比增长304.2%。
In January alone, the country's insurance regulator issued 250 tickets, up 320.5 percent year-on-year, while fines totaled 47.836 million yuan, up 304.2 percent year on year.
45家保险中介机共计被罚566.5万元（不含个人处罚）；33家保险公司，共计被罚3426万元（不含个人处罚），同比增加15家，其中，中国人保财险、天安财险和中国平安产险三家公司以675万元、541万元和260万元的处罚金额排在前三位。
Forty-five insurance brokers were fined a total of 5.665 million yuan (excluding personal penalties), and 33 insurance companies were fined 34.26 million yuan (excluding personal penalties), an increase of 15 from the same period.
银保监会近期公布的处罚决定初步统计显示，今年前两个月，中国保险监管部门共开出289张保险业罚单，2019年前两个月的罚单为167张，罚款金额共2609万元。
Preliminary statistics released by the CBRC show that in the first two months of this year, China's insurance regulator issued 289 insurance tickets, 167 in the first two months of 2019 and a total fine of $26.09 million.
从罚单情况来看，财险依然是保险公司违规最多的领域，1月被处罚的33家公司中，15家为财险公司，2月被处罚的13家保险公司中，8家为财险公司。
In terms of tickets issued, financial insurance remained the area with the largest number of violations by insurance companies, with 15 of the 33 companies fined in January and 8 of the 13 that were penalized in February.
违规事项上包括，弄虚作假数据不实问题、虚假宣传误导消费者问题和虚构保险中介业务套取费用问题、中介机构违规经营问题、内部风险管理漏洞问题、违规返利揽客等保险违规事项均有涉及。
The non-compliance issues include false data, misleading consumers through false propaganda and false insurance intermediary business, illegal operation of intermediary organizations, loopholes in internal risk management and irregular return of customers.
如中国人保财险、天安财险、大地财险 “利用保险中介公司虚构保险中介业务套取费用、编制并提供虚假报表资料”被罚。
For example, the Chinese People's Insurance, Tianan Financial Insurance, Earthquake Financial Insurance "use insurance intermediary companies to fabricate insurance intermediary business fees, prepare and provide false statement information" was punished.
华泰人寿随州中心支公司工作人员在微信朋友圈发布“饥饿”营销宣传，存在以不真实信息欺骗投保人被罚。
Huatai life with the central branch of the state staff in the micro-letter circle of friends "hunger" marketing propaganda, there are false information to deceive policyholders were punished.
阳光人寿向监管部门报送的报表未如实填列“期末营销员人数”，内部控制不严格，风险处置制度机制不健全被罚。
Sunshine Life report to the regulatory authorities did not truthfully fill out "the number of end-of-term marketing staff," internal control is not strict, risk management system mechanism is not sound was punished.
建设银行南昌分行 “贷款强制搭售保险产品”被罚。
CCB Nanchang Branch was fined "for taking out a loan to sell insurance products."
阳光寿险被处罚在经历2017年、2018年两个“严监管”之年后，2019年，监管函、罚单数量、罚款金额都在同步缩减，侧面说明保险业经过整顿乱象受到遏制，但在2020年违规事项再次抬头。
Sunshine Life Insurance Penalties After two years of "tight regulation" in 2017 and 2018, the number of letters of supervision, tickets issued, and fines are all shrinking in 2019, signaling that the insurance industry has been deterred by the chaos of rectification, but violations are rising again in 2020.
分析人士称，保险业严监管不会放松，罚单增加反而意味着“严监管”将成为常态化。
Analysts said strict insurance regulation would not ease and that more tickets would mean "strict supervision" would become the norm.
中国太保专业人士称，疫情加速了保险行业“开门红”的转型升级，这既是保险行业健康发展的历史机遇，也让消费者未来能够获得更多实实在在的保险保障产品。
The epidemic has accelerated the transformation of the insurance industry into a "start-up" industry, according to Chinese Taibao professionals, which is both a historic opportunity for the industry to grow healthily and will give consumers more tangible insurance protection products in the future.
疫情之下，险企普遍意识到数字化转型的重要性与紧迫性，且高效的线上渠道将是未来竞争的关键之一。
Under the epidemic situation, risk enterprises generally realize the importance and urgency of digital transformation, and efficient online channels will be one of the keys to future competition.
但目前互联网保险监管仍处盲区，相关法规还在不断健全，2019年10月10日，银保监会发布《中国银保监会办公厅关于开展银行保险机构侵害消费者权益乱象整治工作的通知》，直指互联网保险侵害消费者权益的系列乱象。
On October 10, 2019, the CBRC issued the Notice of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBRC) on the Work of Banking Insurance Institutions Infringement of Consumer Rights and Interests, pointing to a series of disorder in which Internet insurance infringes on the rights and interests of consumers.
互联网保险销售对保险产品关键信息说明不充分、不明确，如宣传时故意使用误导性词语组合，混淆和模糊保险责任；互联网业务中重要信息披露、风险提示、客户告知不够标准、清晰，如销售页面所载条款或保险责任不全，重要内容未采取字体、颜色等特别提示；将投保过程嵌入其他诸如网络借款等业务流程，而对保额、保费、保险责任、保险产品的承保机构等投保信息告知不足。
Internet insurance sales are inadequate and unclear for key information about insurance products, such as deliberate use of misleading combinations of terms in advertising, confusion and ambiguity of insurance liability; important information disclosure, risk tips, insufficient customer notification, clarity, e.g. sales page terms or incomplete insurance responsibilities, important content without special fonts, colors, etc.; embedding insurance processes into other business processes such as Internet borrowing, and insufficient information on insurance coverage, premiums, insurance liabilities, underwriting institutions, etc.
在网络销售中限制消费者的自由选择权，如与第三方网络借款平台合作，强制消费者在借款过程中投保意外险、保证保险等，若不投保则无法办理借款。
Restrictions on the free choice of consumers in network sales, such as cooperation with third-party Internet borrowing platforms, forcing consumers to take out casualty insurance, guarantee insurance, etc., in the process of borrowing, and failing that, not being able to borrow.
互联网业务中的保险公司、中介机构、第三方网络平台的角色定位边界不清晰、第三方网络平台经营主体与披露合作的第三方网络平台主体不一致，存在违规经营的风险。
Insurers, intermediary organizations and third-party network platforms in the Internet business have unclear role location boundary, the third-party network platform operator and the disclosure cooperation third-party network platform main body is inconsistent, there is a risk of illegal operation.
线上理赔管理不到位，消费者线上申请保险理赔后无人回复且等待时间长，线上线下理赔服务衔接不到位。
Online claims management is not in place, consumer online applications for insurance claims after no response and long waiting time, on-line claim processing services are not in place.
通过第三方网络平台销售保险，发生争议纠纷时，销售平台和保险公司相互推诿、处理时效冗长。
Sell insurance through the third-party network platform, dispute disputes, sales platform and insurance companies each other prevaricate, deal with the long time limit.
保险公司和保险中介机构未完整保存互联网保险销售过程中投保人投保信息、操作轨迹、操作时间，以及保险公司接收投保申请时间等内容。
Insurance companies and insurance intermediaries do not keep complete information about the insured person's insurance, the track of operation, the time of operation, and the time the insurance company accepts the application.
2019年12月，由银保监会牵头起草的《互联网保险业务监管办法(征求意见稿)》正在业内征求意见，相信新互联网保险监管体系将快速出台，互联网保险监管将纳入严监管轨道，保险公司的转型线上同样面临严监管。
In December 2019, the draft Rules for the Supervision of Internet Insurance Business (Exposure Draft), drafted under the leadership of the CBRC, are being consulted by the industry in the belief that a new Internet insurance regulatory system will be put in place quickly, that Internet insurance regulation will be placed on a tight regulatory track, and that insurance companies will also face stringent regulations on the transition line.
