/《传染病》“最近两三天，湖北以七八百甚至上千的病例数在增加，不过还没有达到高峰，接下来会再上升，而且可能上升幅度比较陡。
In the last two or three days, the number of cases in Hubei has been increasing by seven or eight hundred or even thousands.
总体上，应该会到2月中旬，其他省可能会达到高峰，湖北可能还会晚一步。
Overall, other provinces are likely to peak by mid-February, and Hubei may be a little later.
”“在最近两三天，湖北以七八百甚至上千的病例数在增加，不过还没有达到高峰，接下来会再上升，而且可能上升幅度比较陡。
"" In the last two or three days, the number of cases in Hubei has increased by seven or eight hundred or thousands, but it has not yet reached a peak, and will rise again, perhaps steeply.
总体上，应该会到2月中旬，其他省可能达到高峰，湖北可能还会晚一步。
Overall, other provinces are likely to peak by mid-February, and Hubei may be a little later.
”这是昨天，曾参与2003年SARS疫情防控工作的中国疾控中心原副主任杨功焕在接受新周刊采访时发出的预测，在专家看来，新型冠状病毒肺炎（以下简称新冠肺炎）疫情爆发的高峰期还未到来。
In an interview with New Weekly yesterday, Yang Kun-hwan, a former deputy director of the China CDC, who worked on the 2003 SARS epidemic, said the peak of the new coronavirus pneumonia outbreak has yet to come.
2月中旬，其他省可能达到高峰，湖北可能还会晚一步随着大多数省自治区直辖市延后上班时间，人们也越来越感到目前疫情的严重性。
Other provinces are likely to peak in mid-February, and Hubei may be a little later. As most provinces and autonomous regions delay their work schedules, there is also a growing sense of the severity of the epidemic.
虽然截至发稿时确诊数已经超过了17年前的SARS，但杨功焕表示高峰将在2月到来。
Although the number of confirmed cases by the time of writing exceeds the 17-year-old SARS epidemic, Mr. Yang says the peak will come in February.
她说：“即使防控到位，传染病也有其发生发展规律，最近还是会呈现上升态势。
"Even when prevention and control are in place, infectious diseases have a pattern of development and have been on the rise lately," she said.
至于从峰值点开始回落，具体会是哪一天，目前尚不能下定论。
As for the exact date from which the peak point will begin to fall, it is too early to say.
当时，我们的判断还更为严重，预计要到2月中旬甚至2月末，病例数才可能会往下走。
At the time, our judgement was even more serious, and the number of cases was not expected to continue until mid-February or even late February.
”《全国疫情新增趋势图》/丁香医生对防疫来说，确诊病例的上升速度也是疫情防控的重点。
The increasing rate of confirmed cases is also the focus of disease prevention and control, according to the National Map of Emerging Trends in the Epidemic.
杨功焕说：“当时我们有一个判定，认为除湖北以外的其他省份，有可能病例数上升的趋势会有所缓解。
At the time, we had a decision that the upward trend in the number of possible cases would be reduced in provinces other than Hubei, he said.
但需要注意的是，上升趋势有所缓解，并非不上升，而是病例数会增加，但增速有可能会有所缓解。
It is important to note, however, that the upward trend has eased, not by not rising, but by an increase in the number of cases, which is likely to ease somewhat.
因而在这个过程中，并不是风平浪静。
Therefore, in this process, is not calm.
”杨功焕认为湖北以外的病例数，不会再陡然增加：“目前疫情发生面积比较大，就难免在一些局部地区出现病例后，再集中传播。
Mr Yang believes that the number of cases outside Hubei will not increase abruptly: "The relatively large area of the outbreak will inevitably spread again after some local cases."
比如成都、北京等地出现的情况，一个患者曾经接触过很多人。
As in Chengdu, Beijing and other places, a patient has been in contact with many people.
但总体上，在湖北以外的地方，病例数应该不会陡然增加。
But overall, outside Hubei, the number of cases should not rise steeply.
除了湖北，其他省份的病例数虽然每天在上升，但上升坡度不是很剧烈。
With the exception of Hubei, the number of cases in other provinces is rising every day, but the rise is not dramatic.
”因此，她认为，有些疫情地图是根据病例数来标注颜色，把广东、浙江等与湖北标注成同一种颜色，是不妥当的，这一点需要与湖北相区别。
Therefore, in her view, it is inappropriate to label Guangdong, Zhejiang and so on as the same color as Hubei on some epidemic maps based on the number of cases, which needs to be distinguished from Hubei.
湖北仍然是目前最核心地区，而且湖北的疫情高峰甚至会比其他地方来得更晚，她说：“在最近两三天，湖北以七八百甚至上千的病例数在增加，不过还没有达到高峰，接下来会再上升，而且可能上升幅度比较陡。
"In the last two or three days, the number of cases in Hubei has been increasing by seven or eight hundred or even a thousand cases, but it has not yet reached a peak, and it will rise again, possibly steeply.
总体上，应该会到2月中旬，其他省可能达到高峰，湖北可能还会晚一步。
Overall, other provinces are likely to peak by mid-February, and Hubei may be a little later.
”疫情仍处于扩散阶段，市民防疫工作仍不能停。
"The epidemic is still spreading, and the work of preventing epidemic diseases cannot stop.
/《流感》信息通报做得更细致才容易溯源、分析目前对于感染症状也是非常让人头疼的问题，甚至有出现没有明显症状而确诊的病例，这就对疾病的防控带来了很大的麻烦。
The fact that the flu message was more nuanced, that it was easy to trace the source, that the current symptoms of infection were also very troublesome, and that there were even cases diagnosed without obvious symptoms, made the prevention and control of the disease very difficult.
对于这个问题，杨功焕表示：“我认为，新型冠状病毒肺炎发生面已非常广，在这种规模下，多数患者还是会出现发热等症状，会有少数的无症状情况，这可能会难以做到百分之百防控到位。
"I think the new coronavirus pneumonia is very widespread," he said. "At this scale, most patients will have fever and a few asymptomatic conditions, which may make it difficult to achieve 100% control.
”不过她认为，无症状情况，这部分比例应该不会很大：“之所以说疫情在未来的十天、半个月还是会出现上升趋势，应该是考虑到了这部分情况的存在。
But she said the proportion should be small for asymptomatic conditions: "The fact that the epidemic is set to rise in the next 10 days or half a month should be taken into account.
”专家认为我们现在最重要的就是要关注这些无症状的感染者。
Experts say the most important thing now is to focus on these asymptomatic infections.
/@央视新闻在专家看来，目前还有一个问题是通报疫情比较简单，不便于对问题进行追根溯源。
/ / CCTV News In the view of experts, there is another problem is that the notification of the epidemic is relatively simple, not easy to trace the root causes of the problem.
她说：“现在看来，通报疫情还比较简单，虽然分省通报，但爆发点在哪、在哪个区出现病例数、传染源来自哪里、是不是有症状等细节还是应该要了解得更清楚。
"It seems that it is relatively simple to report the outbreak and although it is reported by province, the details of where the outbreak occurred, where it occurred, where it came from and whether it was symptomatic should be better understood," she said.
信息通报做得更细致才容易溯源、分析，有利于描述出分布图以及流行态势、上升幅度等。
More detailed information is easy to trace to the source, analysis, to describe the map as well as the prevalence of the situation, such as the increase.
”而针对社交媒体上出现了很多呼吁全面筛查的声音，针对全面筛查这种说法，杨功焕认为不大可能，因为成本太高。
In response to calls for full screening on social media, Mr Yang said it was unlikely he would be able to do so because the cost would be too high.
但她觉得新冠肺炎是有迹可循的：“我想告诉大家，现在看来，新型冠状病毒肺炎还是有迹可循，是不是去过武汉、是不是直接或间接接触过武汉来的人……这些信息如果能够更多一些，更透明一些——例如现在寻找某趟列车上的旅客、北京人大附中与患者同开家长会的其他人，对此进行隔离观察，这些做法都是有效的，这样可以很大程度避免大家无谓的担心。
But she feels that pneumonia is traceable: "I would like to tell you that the new coronavirus pneumonia is still traceable, has not been to Wuhan, whether direct or indirect contact with Wuhan - such as the current search for passengers on a train, the Beijing People's Congress with patients and other members of the parent-parent association, these practices are effective, greatly avoiding unnecessary worry.
”她劝谕公众：“过度的恐惧确实没有必要。
"Excessive fear," she urged the public, "is really unnecessary.
”恐惧是第二次瘟疫。
Fear is the second plague.
/《流感》北京重启小汤山医院则是先行一步，未雨绸缪而对于疫区中心的武汉，缺少医疗资源，缺少床位是核心问题，已经开始建设的两座隔离医院，已经成为了全武汉期盼的目标。
For Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic area, the shortage of medical resources and beds is the core problem. The two isolated hospitals, which have already begun to be built, have become the target of Wuhan.
因此，杨功焕认为，对于北京而言，更要未雨绸缪，“现在武汉正在建集中收治新型冠状病毒肺炎患者的火神山和雷神山医院，北京小汤山医院也在重启，郑州也在建统一收治患者的医院。
As a result, Yang said, "Wuhan is now building a hospital to treat patients with the new coronavirus pneumonia, while Beijing's Xiaotangshan Hospital is being restarted, and Zhengzhou is in the process of unifying hospitals for treating patients.
”“现在北京的病例数还是在100多例的范围内，但也要看到，出现了人大附中家长会这种情况，因而会担心出现点状的小型爆发。
"There are still more than 100 cases in Beijing, but it is important to note that there are people-parent associations attached to the People's Congress, and that there are fears of a small outbreak at a point.
重启小汤山医院该是先行一步，免得被动。
Restart Xiaotangshan Hospital should be a step ahead, avoid passivity.
”小汤山必要时将启用。
"Xiaotangshan will be activated if necessary.
/@新京报我们视频隔离保护、治疗患者，这种最原始的做法是最有效的办法而社会上许多人也期盼疫苗能尽快上市，助力全国的防疫工作，但杨功焕以专业的角度认为，短期内无法依靠疫苗，“如果说要等到疫苗上市，按照以前的保守估计，基本上是不可能的。
/ @ The Beijing News: Our Video Isolation to Protect and Treat Patients, the most primitive approach, is the most effective and many in the community are hoping that the vaccine will go on sale as soon as possible to help the nation's immunization efforts.
因为疫苗有安全性与有效性的要求，研制过程中，涉及到的技术难点原则上也很多。
Because the vaccine has the safety and the validity request, in the development process, involves the technical difficulty in principle also many.
即便研制出来，是不是能产生有效抗体这一点非常重要。
Even if developed, it is important that effective antibodies are produced.
”事实上，在17年前的SARS期间，疫苗根本没有起作用。
Indeed, vaccines did not work at all during SARS 17 years ago.
杨功焕回忆道：“做病毒性的疫苗有一定难度，以乙肝疫苗为例，经过数年和多轮实验才上市。
"It is difficult to get a viral vaccine," Yang recalled. "The hepatitis B vaccine, for example, took several years and several rounds of experimentation before it went on sale.
在SARS期间，也研究疫苗，经过了半年多，这已经是加紧状态了。
During the SARS period, vaccines were also studied, and after more than half a year, this was intensified.
事实上，SARS疫苗并没有用上，因为6个月以后，这个病就没有了。
In fact, the SARS vaccine was not used because six months later, the disease was gone.
”不是人类战胜了SARS，而是SARS放过了人类。
"It was not humans who conquered SARS; it was SARS that spared them.
/ unsplash所以，杨功焕认为，目前隔离保护、治疗患者，这种最原始的做法是最有效的办法。
So, according to Yang, the most primitive approach to protecting and treating patients in isolation is the most effective one.
“我看了钟南山的讲话，有一点说得特别好，医院除了配备传染病专家，还要配备重症方面的专家。
"I read Zhong Nan Shan speech, one thing is particularly good, the hospital in addition to the infectious disease experts, but also equipped with serious illness experts.
单纯传染病专家是不行的，有重症医学专家共同努力，才有可能更好地抢救病人。
Simple infectious disease experts can not, with the joint efforts of severe medical experts, it is possible to better rescue patients.
”“我认为钟南山的这点提醒非常好。
"" I think that's a very good reminder of Zhong Nan Shan.
在治疗患者的时候，虽然目前没有特效药，但我国的重症医学技术发展还是很快的，有很多办法可以帮助危重患者挺过去、度过难关。
In the treatment of patients, although there are no specific drugs, but the development of China's critical medical technology is still rapid, there are many ways to help critically ill patients through difficulties.
”“对于疫苗的期盼，我能够理解这种心情，但大家还是要知道，不会那么快。
"I can understand the expectation of a vaccine, but you have to know that it won't happen that fast.
”杨功焕最后对比了17年前后两场战役，她认为我们的公共卫生有了长足的进步，但并不是说十全十美。
After comparing 17 years of fighting, Yang thinks our public health has come a long way, but not that it is perfect.
“与SARS时相比，我们的公共卫生进步很多，但也不全是直线式进步。
"There has been a lot of progress in public health compared to SARS, but it's not all linear.
有些东西，比如说不能吃野生动物，这一点本来在SARS时大家印象深刻，但SARS过后，很多人对于这个教训就慢慢忘记了。
Some things, such as being unable to eat wild animals, were impressive at the time of SARS, but after SARS, many people began to forget the lesson.
