无论市场好与坏，对楼市的管控都不会放松在经历2019年上半年火与热、下半年冰与冷的行情后，众多房企、投资客和研究机构都在预测分析——2020年的楼市“小阳春”将带来怎样的惊喜。
Whether the market is good or bad, regulation of the housing market will not let up. After the first half of 2019, when fire and heat began, and ice and cold began in the second half of 2019, many housing companies, investors, and research institutions are predicting how the housing market will surprise Xiaoyang Chun in 2020.
孰料，突如其来的新冠肺炎踩下了各地楼市的“急刹车”。
Who knows, the sudden new crown pneumonia trampled down all over the property market "brakes."
一时间，各地楼市进入“冬眠”。
For a time, property markets around the "hibernation."
随着疫情慢慢得到控制，各地陆续开展复工复建。
As the outbreak was slowly brought under control, work began to resume everywhere.
3月11日，深圳市住房和建设局发布《关于应对新冠肺炎疫情支持房地产企业加快复工复产的若干措施》的通知，其中明确指出，对已批未开盘、已批在售项目的房地产开发企业，允许视疫情防控情况现场开盘、开放线下售楼处。
On March 11, the Shenzhen Municipal Housing and Construction Bureau issued the Notice on Measures to Support Real Estate Enterprises to Accelerate the Resumption of Work in the New Crown Pneumonia Epidemic, which clearly indicates that the unopened real estate development enterprises that have already approved the projects for sale are allowed to open on-site and open off-line sales offices depending on the prevention and control of the epidemic.
深圳的新政，似乎让房地产看到一丝曙光。
Shenzhen's New Deal, seems to let a glimmer of real estate.
不过，“解冻”后的楼市将走向何方？作为各方最关心的话题，房价真的会降吗？小阳春或难再现基于春节返乡置业潮，每年的房地产市场在春季会出现一波销售旺季，行业内称之为“小阳春”。
But where will the "thawing" housing market go? As the topic of most concern, will house prices really fall? Xiao Yangchun or difficult to reappear based on the Spring Festival homecoming home, the annual real estate market in the spring will appear a wave of sales, industry known as "xiangchun."
但庚子鼠年，目前还没有让任何一家房企感受到春天的温暖。
But the Year of the Rat, so far has not let any of the housing enterprises feel the warmth of spring.
疫情冲击下，楼市成交量接连下滑。
Under the impact of the epidemic, property market volume has declined.
根据中国房地产决策咨询数据平台（CRIC）监测，春节期间88个重点城市商品房成交量相比2018年春节假期减少63%，部分三四线城市零成交，住房需求短期被抑制。
According to the China real estate advisory data platform (CRIC) monitoring, 88 key cities during the Spring Festival compared to 2018 Spring Festival volume decreased 63%, some three or four-line cities zero transactions, short-term housing demand was suppressed.
中指研究院发布的《疫情对房地产市场及企业影响调查》报告显示，在500位地产经理人中，近八成认为此次疫情对楼市的抑制作用高于2003年“非典”，普遍对2020年房地产市场发展预判较为悲观，超半数认为疫情对整个房地产市场影响周期为两个季度。
Nearly 80 percent of the 500 real estate managers thought the epidemic would have a greater dampening effect on the housing market than SARS in 2003, according to the Institute's report on the Impact of the Epidemic on the Real Estate Market and Enterprises.
从全年来看，超半数受访者认为今年销售规模会下滑，其中25%预计所在公司的成交规模会下降10%-30%，20%认为降幅在10%以内。
Over the course of the year, more than half of those surveyed expected sales to fall this year, with 25 per cent expecting a 10-30 per cent decline in business volume and 20 per cent a decline of less than 10 per cent.
而从各大房企发布的1-2月份的销售数据来看，销售量均有不同程度的下滑。
And from the January to February sales figures issued by the major housing enterprises, sales have all declined in varying degrees.
目前，除恒大集团2月业绩逆势增长外，据统计，富力地产、中国金茂、禹洲地产、正荣地产、新城控股、雅居乐集团这6家企业2月销售量降幅较超过了50%。
In addition to the negative growth of Heng Da Group in February, six companies - Fuli Properties, Jinmao, Yuzhou Real Estate, Zhengwong Properties, Xincheng Holdings and YaguLe Group - reported sales declines of more than 50% in February.
3月2日克尔瑞发布《2020年1-2月中国房地产企业销售TOP100排行榜》从1-2月的累计销售金额来看，百强房企整体的业绩规模同比降低23.8%。
On March 2, Kerry released the "TOP 100 List of Sales by Chinese Real Estate Enterprises in January and February 2020." From January to February, the total sales volume of the top 100 housing companies was 23.8 percent lower than the year-on-year.
其中，有超8成的百强房企2月单月和累计业绩同比双降。

In terms of market-level data on urban demand and supply, most cities in the CRIC focused on urban monitoring in February, with zero supply in most cities and a 77% year-on-year decline in volume in key first- and second-tier cities, and 90% year-on-year in Guangzhou, Ningbo, Chongqing, Xi'an, Nanning, Dalian and Wuhan.
贝壳研究院发布的数据显示，2020年1-2月份，北京链家二手房的实时成交量同比下降了约57.6%。
Between January and February 2020, real-time sales of second-hand homes in Beijing fell by about 57.6% from a year earlier, according to data released by the Shell Institute.
此外，价格方面也有所下滑。
There has also been a decline in prices.
贝壳研究院发布的数据显示，2月份北京二手房的成交均价为54115元/平方米，环比下跌了8.6%，同比下跌了9.7%。

就在市场一片清冷之际，近60城市政府出手维稳楼市。
In the cold market, nearly 60 city governments to stabilize the property market.
其中，河南驻马店市发布《关于进一步规范促进房地产业平稳健康发展的意见》，出台17项稳楼市政策。
Among them, Henan Zhumadian City issued "Further standardize the promotion of stable and healthy development of the real estate industry," 17 stable housing policies.
规定，用公积金购买首套房，最低首付比例由30%下调为20%。
Provides for the use of provident funds to purchase the first suite, the minimum down payment rate from 30% to 20%.
就在各方认为房地产行业将要复苏回暖之际，2月28日，河南省政府约谈了驻马店市政府相关负责同志，对驻马店近期房地产政策的执行提出了明确的要求。
On Feb. 28, the provincial government of Henan interviewed leading comrades in charge of the government of Madian City just as the real estate industry was expected to recover.
约谈要求驻马店市坚持房住不炒的定位，不将房地产作为短期刺激经济的手段，实现三稳目标。
Interview asked Ma Dian to adhere to the position of not stir-fried housing, not real estate as a short-term means to stimulate the economy, achieve the goal of stability.
3月7日，海南省一纸“限购令”更是让整个市场重新开始思考2020年的房地产行情。
On March 7, a "restraining order" in Hainan Province prompted the entire market to rethink its real estate market in 2020.
海南当晚召开的新闻发布会，不仅明确规定“新出让土地建设的商品住房，实行现房销售制度”用以控制期房售房方法，而且指出“对在海南已经拥有两套及以上住房的本省户籍和常住居民家庭，停止向其销售安居型商品住房和市场化商品住房”。
Hainan night held a press conference, not only clearly defined "new land sales of commercial housing, the implementation of the current housing sales system" to control the method of housing sales, but also pointed out that "Hainan has two or more housing units and residents of the province, to stop the sale of residential housing and commercial housing."
一方面，房企的销量下滑；一方面，各地楼市政策反复震荡，疫情之下，下跌似乎已经成了部分人的共识，那房价到底会走向何方呢？“稳”字当头业内人士告诉中国新闻周刊，近年来，房价一直处于“稳”的状态，国家调控之下，房地产市场趋于冷静，正在向健康稳健方向发展，告别了激烈震荡的“疯狂期”，虽然在疫情影响之下，1-2月份部分城市的楼市成交量低迷，但巨大的刚需市场仍在给这个行业托底，近期不太可能出现剧烈涨跌的情况。
On the one hand, housing sales decline; on the one hand, housing policies around the repeated shocks, the epidemic, the decline seems to have become part of the consensus, the industry has been "stable" in recent years, the state-regulated, the real estate market is moving toward a healthy and sound, although the impact of the epidemic, the huge demand market for the industry is still bottoming out, not likely in the near future.
此前，贝壳研究院公布了一份名为《疫情下的住房消费者预期调查》的报告。
Earlier, the shell Research Institute published a report called "Housing Consumer Expectations Survey under the Epidemic."
其中有数据显示仅有8.5%的受访者受疫情影响取消了买房计划，有9.7%的受访者表示会按原计划买房，有超过60%的受访者表示会推迟购房计划。
Only 8.5 percent of the respondents cancelled their plans, 9.7 percent said they would buy according to the plan and more than 60 percent said they would postpone the purchase.
不难看出，在刚需条件的催化下，尽管六成受访者表示推迟购房计划，但并未放弃购买的需求。
It is not hard to see why 60 per cent of respondents, catalysed by just-in-demand conditions, said they were postponing their plans but did not give up the need to buy.
58研究院发布的一份报告也佐证了这一数据，1月份，全国临感VR售楼处访问量占比提升，环比上涨57.7%；北京、海口、太原的临感VR售楼处访问量占比环比增长超70%。
The figures are backed up by a report released by the Institute, which in January saw a 57.7 per cent rise in visits to VR sales offices nationwide, with Beijing, Haikou and Taiyuan accounting for an increase of more than 70 per cent.
“疫情结束后，期间积压的购房需求或将得到释放”，58安居客房产研究院分院院长张波认为。
"After the end of the epidemic, the backlog of housing purchase needs may be released," said Zhang Bo, director of the residential housing and production institute branch.
复盘2003年的SARS不难看出，疫情对房地产市场会有短暂的影响，但是对整体的市场行情的影响并不明显。
Duplicate the SARS in 2003 is not difficult to see that the epidemic will have a short-term impact on the real estate market, but the overall market impact is not obvious.
受SARS疫情影响，2003年二季度我国GDP出现明显放缓，但仅影响一个季度后就出现了快速修复，期间主要冲击了消费类行业，但对于房地产投资及量价的影响相对较小，其中房地产投资和销售面积也仅是在3月、4月出现了一定幅度增速高位放缓，但5月就实现了修复，2003年全年房地产投资和销售面积增速分别高达30%和29%。
Due to the SARS epidemic, China's GDP slowed markedly in the second quarter of 2003, but recovered quickly after only one quarter, mainly affecting the consumer sector. However, the impact on real estate investment and volume was relatively small. Real estate investment and sales slowed only in March and April.
需要注意的事，两次疫情期间我国房地产市场所处的宏观经济环境、政策环境、市场环境等方面存在差异。
Need to pay attention to the two epidemics of China's real estate market in the macroeconomic environment, policy environment, market environment and other aspects of the differences.
2003年SARS疫情影响期间，货币、楼市政策等方面较为宽松，房地产行业受到政策支持。
During the SARS epidemic in 2003, monetary and housing policies were relaxed and the real estate sector was supported by policies.
而2017年之后房地产行业调控力度初显，推行稳地价、稳房价、稳预期的长效管理调控机制仍是坚定不移的。
And after 2017, the real estate industry regulation efforts to promote stable land price, stable house prices, stable expectations of the long-term management control mechanism is still unswerving.
近日，人民银行会同财政部、银保监会召开金融支持疫情防控和经济社会发展座谈会暨电视电话会也特别强调坚持房子是用来住的、不是用来炒的定位和“不将房地产作为短期刺激经济的手段”要求，保持房地产金融政策的连续性、一致性、稳定性。
Recently, the People's Bank of China, together with the Ministry of Finance and the CBRC, held a symposium on financial support for epidemic prevention, economic and social development and a telephone conference.
稳字当头必将成为2020年的主旋律。
Stabilizing the word is bound to become the theme of 2020.
财经评论员严跃进表示，近来住房和城乡建设部再次明确，长期坚持“房子是用来住的、不是用来炒的”定位。
Finance commentator Yan Yuejin said that recently the Ministry of Housing and Urban and Rural Construction had made it clear for a long time that "the house is used for housing, not stir-frying."
此中新意在于强调了“长期”，这表明“房住不炒”定位不会受到市场周期影响。
What is new here is the emphasis on "long-term," which shows that the positioning of "housing without stir-frying" will not be affected by market cycles.
无论市场好与坏，对楼市的管控都不会放松，这对于2020年及未来的楼市发展都有很强的指导意义。
Whether the market is good or bad, the control of the housing market will not relax, this 2020 and the future of the housing market will have a strong guidance.
同时，相关政策也明确提出发展长效机制和调控机制，体现了引导楼市健康平稳成长的思路。
At the same time, relevant policies also clearly define the development of long-term mechanism and regulatory mechanism, reflects the guidance of healthy and stable growth of the housing market.
此外，3月6日，住房和城乡建设部部长王蒙徽在《人民日报》发表署名文章提出，着力稳地价稳房价稳预期，保持房地产市场平稳健康发展。
In addition, on 6 March, the Minister of Housing, Urban and Rural Development, Wang Menghui, published an op-ed article in the People's Daily.
长期坚持“房子是用来住的、不是用来炒的”定位，继续稳妥实施房地产市场平稳健康发展长效机制方案，建立和完善政策协同、调控联动、监测预警、舆情引导、市场监管等房地产调控体制机制，落实城市主体责任，因城施策、分类指导，保持房地产市场平稳运行。
We will continue to implement the long-term mechanism plan for stable and healthy development of the real estate market, establish and improve the system of regulation and control of real estate such as policy coordination, regulation and linkage, monitoring and early warning, public opinion guidance and market supervision, so as to ensure the smooth operation of the real estate market.
据央行官网2月20日消息，LPR最新报价为：1年期LPR为4.05%，5年期以上LPR为4.75%。
The latest LPR offer was 4.05% for one-year LPR and 4.75% for LPR older than 5 years, the central bank said.
此前，2020年1月20日公布的1年期LPR为4.15%，5年期以上为4.8%。
Previously, the one-year LPR published on 20 January 2020 was 4.15 per cent and 4.8 per cent over the five-year period.
LPR的下降释放了什么信号，是否意味着房产又将异军突起？国家金融与发展实验室特聘研究员董希淼认为，此次LPR下降这可能体现两个方面的意图，第一，疫情对我国经济的影响是短期的，因此短端利率下降更多，重在帮助企业渡过当前的难关；5年期以上LPR下降5个基点，不向房地产市场放出宽松信号，表明房地产调控仍未放松。
Dong Miao, a special researcher at the National Finance and Development Laboratory, thinks the fall in the LPR may reflect two intentions. First, because the epidemic's impact on our economy is short-term, short-term interest rates have fallen even more, focusing on helping companies weather the current difficulties.
