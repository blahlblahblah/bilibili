2003年SARS疫情，常住人口最多（1700万）的上海市，仅有8人感染。
The SARS epidemic in 2003 affected only eight people in Shanghai, home to the largest resident population (17 million).
且都为散发状态，未出现大规模聚集性爆发。
They were all in the state of dispersal, and no large-scale agglomeration occurred.
上海市在疫情未到来时，就做了充分的准备。
Shanghai made full preparations when the outbreak did not come.
下沉到基层社区、落实到个人的防控措施，对于疫情控制起到重要作用。
Subsidence to the grass-roots community, to the implementation of individual control measures, for the control of the epidemic plays an important role.
上海首例被发现的感染者就有很强的防范意识，主动报告，自我隔离。
Shanghai's first case of infection was found to have a strong sense of prevention, proactive reporting, self-isolation.
一名小学生顶着家长压力，如实汇报家中是否接触过外地人员，被评为“诚实卫士”。
A primary school student, under pressure from his parents, reported truthfully whether or not his family had been in contact with foreign personnel and was rated "honest guardian."
专家认为，市民个体+制度体系+医学专家，构成三根链条，共同阻止了上海SARS疫情蔓延。
Experts believe that the individual citizen + system + medical experts, constitute three chains, together to prevent the spread of the SARS epidemic in Shanghai.
从2002年11月到2003年6月的SARS疫情中，中国境内（含香港）累计7000多人感染，死亡649人。
From November 2002 to June 2003, more than 7,000 people in China (including Hong Kong) were infected and 649 died.
其中，以北京、广东、香港特区疫情最为严重。
Beijing, Guangdong and the Hong Kong SAR are among the worst affected.
三地感染人数均超过千人，广东死亡人数超过50人，北京超过100人，香港达到300人。
More than 1,000 people were infected in all three places, with Guangdong killing more than 50, Beijing with more than 100 and Hong Kong with 300.
而国内常住人口最多（2003年统计数字为1700万）的上海市，在整个SARS疫情爆发期间，仅有8人感染，2人死亡。
In Shanghai, home to the largest resident population (17 million in 2003), only eight people were infected and two died during the SARS outbreak.
据当年媒体报道，上海市的SARS疫情呈现如下特点：1、以外地输入为主；2、全部病例都做到有源可查；3、疫情呈散发状态，8例病例发生时间跨度两个月；4、无医护人员感染；5、接触者发病率低，8个病例，共隔离密切接触者333人，其中只有1例确诊。
According to media reports that year, the SARS epidemic in Shanghai showed the following characteristics: (1) Mainly imported; (2) active investigation of all cases; (3) spread of the disease with 8 cases spread over a two-month period; (4) lack of infection among medical personnel; and (5) low incidence of contact with 8 cases.
和其他疫情严重地区相比，这样的疫情堪称“和风细雨”。
Compared with other severely affected areas, such an outbreak can be described as "mild rain."
其中，或许存在幸运的几率，但更是多项有力措施并进的结果，并逐渐形成了一套下沉到社区基层的防控体系。
Among them, there may be a lucky chance, but more than a number of powerful measures to go hand in hand, and gradually formed a set of community-level sink control system.
这些举措，是这座城市在1988年遭遇30余万人感染的甲肝疫情后，用数年教训积累而来的经验。
These are lessons learned from years of experience in the wake of the city's 1988 hepatitis A epidemic, which infected more than 300,000 people.
前事不忘，后事之师。
Never forget the past.
即便如此，对于武汉新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情的愈演愈烈，上海也无法掉以轻心。
Even so, the new Wuhan coronavirus pneumonia epidemic intensified, Shanghai can not take lightly.
据八点健闻了解，近期仅通过航班交通，就有超过8万人群自武汉来沪，防控压力巨大。
According to eight JianWen, recently only through flight traffic, more than 80,000 people from Wuhan to Shanghai, prevention and control pressure is enormous.
此外，非典之后的十多年，上海也同样面临着城市发展的新变化，曾在SARS期间发挥了重大作用的基层防控体系，也将再次面临新的挑战。
In addition, more than a decade after SARS, Shanghai is also facing new changes in urban development. The grass-roots control system, which played a major role during SARS, will again face new challenges.
诚实的小学生，自我隔离的感染者2003年SARS期间，上海坊间流传着一个极富戏剧性和代表性的故事。
An Honest Pupil and Self-Isolated Infected Person During the SARS epidemic in 2003, a dramatic and representative story was told in Shanghai.
杨浦区世界小学一名三年级学生，在返校填写“防范非典情况报告表”时，一度犹豫了很久。
Yangpu District, a third-grade primary school students, returned to school to fill out the "SARS Report Form," a long hesitation.
这样的表格，对于经历过SARS的人来说，并不陌生。
Such forms are no strangers to people who have experienced SARS.
几乎每个有单位管辖的人都会被要求填写。
Almost everyone who has a unit will be asked to fill it in.
上面除了个人是否出现发烧、咳嗽等疑似SARS症状，还会调查个人接触感染源的情况。
In addition to the above whether individuals have fever, cough and other suspected SARS symptoms, but also to investigate personal exposure to the source of infection.
那个小学生之所以犯难，就是不知道如何回答“家中是否接待过外地人员”。
The difficulty for the pupil was that he did not know how to answer the question "Have you ever received a foreigner at home?"
因为实际情况是接待过，而爷爷曾经嘱咐他，要在这一栏填“无”。
As the actual situation was one of reception, Grandpa had instructed him to enter "No" in this column.
经历一番思想斗争之后，他把表格中的“无”划掉，用铅笔在旁边认真写上“外地表姐来过”。
After some ideological struggle, he crossed out the "nothing" in the form and carefully penciled it "Field cousin came."
让这个小学生没有想到的是，后来他竟然成为了学校的“诚实小卫士”。
What did not occur to the pupil was that he turned out to be the "honest little guard" of the school.
事实上，在学校里，同样面临真实与谎言选择的，并不止他一人。
In fact, he was not alone in school, facing the same real and false choices.
“爸爸骂我的时候，我问他我错在哪里，他说不出来的……过两天他悄悄跟我说是他不好。
"When Dad scolded me, I asked him what I had done wrong and he couldn't tell... He whispered to me in two days that it was his fault.
”另一个曾经揭穿爸爸谎报体温的同学这样说道。
"said another student who had exposed his father's false body temperature.
而每天测量体温并如实报告，也是当年防控SARS的常规操作。
And daily temperature measurement and truthful reporting, is the same year of routine control of SARS operations.
这些敢于戳破大人谎言的孩子，有不少因此受到家长的责骂。
Many of these children, who dare to expose adults to lies, are scolded by their parents.
但杨浦区世界小学的老师后来告诉媒体，在这场诚实与谎言的较量中，孩子们显然是胜利者。
But teachers at the Yangpu World Primary School later told the media that the children were clear winners in the contest between honesty and lies.
“因为现在几乎所有家长都能认真执行体测体温和情况表的填写工作，不少曾经谎填的父母还通过电话表示，通过这次事件，觉得自己的孩子长大了。
"Because almost all parents now conscientiously carry out body temperature and fact sheet filling out, a number of parents who have lied also said by telephone, through this incident, feel their children have grown up.
”在疫情的控制上，市民个人的传染病防范意识是非常重要的一环。
"In the control of the epidemic, the individual awareness of the prevention of infectious diseases is very important.
纪录片《非典十周年祭》就提到，北京SARS爆发初期，不少病人会隐瞒病情，一位老太太因担心医护人员得知其曾经照顾患SARS的老伴，而不对她实施救治，向医生隐瞒了其SARS患者接触史；另一名秦姓患者，就诊时隐瞒病情，以致最初护理他的15名医护人员全部感染。
In the early days of the SARS outbreak in Beijing, patients hid their illness, an old woman concealed her SARS patient's contact history from doctors, and another patient named Qin hid his illness from doctors, causing all 15 medical workers who initially cared for him to become infected, the documentary said.
上海相对幸运，首例被发现的感染者有很强的自我隔离意识。
Shanghai is relatively fortunate to have a strong sense of self-isolation in its first case of infection.
据新华网报道，上海首例SARS患者李女士，是当年3月27日从香港回上海的，当时她自已就有一种不祥预感，因此从机场回到母亲家时没敢出门，把随身所带的行李留在母亲家后就直接到医院看病，4月2日确诊感染。
The first SARS patient in Shanghai, Ms. Li, returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong on March 27 that year with a sense of foreboding, so she did not venture out of the airport to her mother's home and left her luggage at her mother's home to see the doctor directly.
病人虽然注意了预防，但还是留下了传染源：一个行李包，还有间接接触的母亲和两个孩子。
Although the patient took care of the prevention, he left the source of infection: a luggage bag, as well as a mother and two children who were in indirect contact.
解救老人和孩子刻不容缓。
Rescuing the old and children is urgent.
但患者有三个住处，一个孩子念初中、一个孩子在托儿所，如果两个孩子受到感染，将对周围的孩子产生十分严重的后果。
But patients have three homes, one child attends junior high school and one is in a nursery, and if two children are infected, the consequences for the children around them will be very serious.
4月2日，确诊的当晚10点，徐汇区疾控中心两位工作人员就摸黑找到患者在徐汇区的住处，对患者母亲进行思想工作后，迅速将掌握的情况报告徐汇区委、区政府。
April 2, the night of the diagnosis at 10: 00, Xuhui District CDC staff on the dark to find the patient in Xuhui District residence, the patient's mother ideological work, promptly reported the situation to the Xuhui District Committee, the regional government.
4月3日开始，有关部门对老人和两个孩子实行了３天的医学观察，并对他们家进行彻底消毒，直到警报解除。
The elderly and their two children were kept under medical observation for three days and their homes were thoroughly disinfected until the alarm was lifted, the ministry said on April 3.
这些故事是2003年上海SARS防控的的缩影。
These stories epitomize the prevention and control of SARS in Shanghai in 2003.
细如毛发，落实到个人的监控措施，人人有责的信息报告和流通，对自己和他人高度负责的意识，在疫情防控中都缺一不可。
A sense of responsibility for oneself and others, from fine hair to individual surveillance measures, to the reporting and flow of information for which everyone is responsible, is indispensable for disease control.
下沉到社区基层的防控体系在疑似病例的早期发现、市民的接触情况等基础信息层面，社区基层监控体系，发挥了重要的作用。
The system of prevention and control sinking to community grass-roots level plays an important role in the early detection of suspected cases and people's exposure to basic information.
根据2003年8月发表在《中国全科医学》的一篇论文，我们可以一窥当年上海SARS的社区防范机制是怎样运行的。
According to a paper published in August 2003 in the Chinese Journal of General Medicine, we have a glimpse of how the Shanghai SARS Community Preventive Mechanism worked.
上海市社区卫生服务组织成立了组织网络，实行两级管理制度。
The Shanghai Community Health Service Organization has established an organizational network and implemented a two-tier management system.
△ 制图：吴晔婷社区卫生服务中心每天中午12点以后向区卫生局上报，前一天中午12点至当日中午12点的疫情、当天实施医学观察中发现的情况，提出防治工作中的薄弱环节及已经采取的措施。
Mapping: Wu selected community health service center after 12 noon every day to report to the District Health Bureau, the previous day 12 noon to 12 noon epidemic situation, the implementation of the medical observation found in the same day, the weak links in the prevention and treatment work and the measures that have been taken.
每天12点向街道办事处上报前一天中午12点至当日中午12点的疫情，及时提供返回和来该地人员的信息，及时反映居委会的工作情况，同时街道办事处每天将各居委会查到的反馈和来该地的人员信息传真到社区卫生服务中心进行核对。
At 12: 00 a.m. each day, the street offices are informed of the outbreak from 12 noon to 12 noon on the previous day, timely information is provided on the return and arrival of persons, and the work of the neighbourhood committees is duly reflected, while the neighbourhood offices fax daily the feedback received from neighbourhood committees and the information on the people who come to the area to the community health centres for verification.
前述小学生及其家长的人员接触和体温等信息报告，就是这个网络中的一个环节。
The aforementioned information report on personal contact and body temperature of pupils and their parents is one of the links in this network.
同时，每天12点30分之前还要向区疾控中心上报前一天中午12点至当日中午12点的疫情，同时区疾控中心及时下传密切接触者的信息。
At the same time, the epidemic situation between 12: 00 noon and 12: 00 noon the day before is reported to the CDC at 12: 30 each day, while the CDC transmits information on close contacts in time.
由社区卫生服务中心上门落实医学观察。
Medical observation is carried out by community health service centres.
社区卫生服务中心接到患者，会通过预检护士询问病史，将疑似病例报告给专职医生，同时报告防治领导小组和技术小组，通过复诊后仍为疑似病例的，报给区一级疾控中心，通知防疫小组进行疫点消毒和健康教育。
Upon receiving the patient, the community health service center will inquire the patient's medical history through the pre-screening nurse, report the suspected case to the specialized doctor, and report the suspected case to the prevention and treatment leading group and the technical team.
△ 制图：吴晔婷对于疫区返回人员，街道、区疾控中心或其他途径提供疫区返回人员名单，社区卫生服务中心负责指导消毒、测体温和记录症状，同时居委会进行日常生活监护。
Mapping: Wu selected for epidemic areas returnees, streets, district CDC or other ways to provide a list of returnees, community health services centres responsible for disinfection, temperature measurement and recording symptoms, while residential committees for daily life monitoring.
对从疫区返回人员的家庭，进行为期十天的医学观察。
Medical observation of families returning from affected areas for a period of 10 days.
△ 制图：吴晔婷对与SARS患者有密切接触者，区疾控中心通知街道和社区卫生服务中心，由居委会和社区卫生服务中心防疫小组上门对密切接触者家庭进行调查，并指导消毒、健康教育、测量体温和门诊记录，同时进行流行病学调查。
Cartography: Wu selected close contacts with SARS patients, the District CDC notified the street and community health services centers, by neighborhood committee and community health service center vaccination teams to conduct home visits to close contacts, disinfection, health education, temperature measurement and clinical records, as well as epidemiological investigation.
医学观察十天后，无症状出现或排除疑似病例，方可结案。
After 10 days of medical observation, no symptoms appeared or suspected cases were ruled out before the case could be closed.
△ 制图：吴晔婷前文说到，2003年上海的SARS疫情中，全部感染病例都做到有源可查。
Mapping: Wu selected the previous article said that in 2003 Shanghai SARS epidemic, all cases of infection are active can be found.
最终我们看到的结果是，上海的疫情都是散发状态，未出现大规模聚集性爆发，这套细致入微的监控体系功不可没。
In the end, what we see is that the epidemic in Shanghai is in a state of dispersal, with no large-scale agglomeration.
当然，体系都是由人构成的。
Of course, the system is made up of people.
从当时的一些新闻报道中，可以看出这套体系的效能：上海某街道一位大妈会跑到她所在区域的一家五星级宾馆，配合有关部门对一位外籍友人进行医学隔离观察；一位居委会干部为了解某房屋到底是谁来承租，可以在其门前从早晨一直守候到深夜。
A woman from a Shanghai street would go to a five-star hotel in her area to observe the medical isolation of a foreign friend, and a neighborhood official could wait in front of her door from morning till late at night to find out who was renting the house.
有幸运成分，也有得力的措施2003年4月下旬，世界卫生组织（WHO）专家小组到上海考察疫情防治工作，对上海在过去一个月里建起一个SARS防控系统表示高度赞赏。
In late April 2003, a team of experts from the World Health Organization (WHO) visited Shanghai to study the epidemic and expressed great appreciation for the fact that Shanghai had built a SARS prevention and control system in the past month.
一位WHO专家表示，上海没有像北京和广东那样大范围爆发SARS有两个原因：首先存在幸运成分，SARS并非在全世界广泛传播，中国不同地区的发病率也有所不同。
A WHO expert says there are two reasons why SARS is not as widespread in Shanghai as it is in Beijing and Guangdong: First, there are lucky ingredients, SARS is not widely spread around the world, and the incidence varies from region to region in China.
其次，上海市政府措施控制得力，一些病毒携带者在进入上海之前，已被发现并采取了控制措施。
Second, the city government has strong controls in place, and some carriers of the virus have been discovered and taken control before entering Shanghai.
曾参加过广东和北京等地SARS疫情调研的WHO专家组成员Li Ailan曾对媒体表示，上海医疗体系在病人早期隔离、医院感染控制等方面做得较好，由于有广东和北京的经验，上海的医院隔离和病人密切跟踪等措施都很到位。
Li Ailan, a WHO expert group member who has studied the SARS epidemic in Guangdong and Beijing, told the media that the Shanghai health-care system is doing a good job of early patient isolation and hospital infection control.
疫情来临之前，上海市用足了提前量。
Shanghai took full advantage of the epidemic before it hit.
时任上海市卫生局局长刘俊，后来告诉媒体：在2003年1月和2月，上海市卫生局一直密切关注外地疫情变化，并实时监测WHO网站上有关疫情信息报告。
In January and February 2003, the Shanghai Health Bureau was closely monitoring the change of epidemic situation in the field and monitoring the report of epidemic information on the WHO website in real time.
2月11日，正式向上级提交各地“非典型肺炎”情况报告。
On February 11, a report on the "SARS" situation in various places was officially submitted to higher authorities.
2月12日，市主要领导在报告上作出批示，拉开上海防治SARS的序幕。
February 12, the city's main leaders in the report to make an order to open Shanghai to prevent and treat SARS prelude.
接批示后，上海市卫生局便组织专家制定预案，并着手拟定《防治“非典型肺炎”指南》，设立“零报告”疫情监测点。
After receiving the order, the Shanghai Health Bureau organized experts to work out plans, and set out to draw up guidelines for the prevention and treatment of "SARS" and set up a "zero-report" epidemiological surveillance point.
这些工作与上海市3月底出现第一例SARS病例前后相距了50天。
The work was 50 days away from the first SARS case in Shanghai at the end of March.
对于归属不同的各家医院、各级疾控中心和预防机构，上海市卫生局均实行了统一行业管理。
The Shanghai Health Bureau has implemented unified industry management for hospitals, disease control centers at all levels and prevention organizations.
这样的管理基础在SARS防治中发挥了积极作用。
This management foundation has played an active role in SARS prevention and treatment.
在疾病防治开始阶段，上海市共建有110家监测点，囊括了所有二级和三级医院，随后又扩大到508家，囊括所有医疗机构。
In the early stages of disease prevention and control, there were 110 monitoring stations in Shanghai, covering all secondary and tertiary hospitals, which were subsequently expanded to 508 to cover all medical institutions.
每个监测点都实行三种报告制度：一是“零报告”，所有监测点每24小时必须逐级报告疫情，无疫情零报告；二是“全报告”，，所有医疗机构的医护人员见到SARS病例必须报告，不得隐瞒；三是紧急报告，对于群体发病、校内学生发病、特别危重病人等情况，必须在发病即刻立即电话报告，一小时内补充书面报告，这些报告会逐级上报，经市疾控中心，最后到达上海市卫生局。
Every surveillance site has three reporting systems: First, "zero reports," in which all surveillance stations must report every 24 hours, with no reports of any outbreak. Second, "all medical personnel must report SARS cases without concealment.
刘俊在总结上海市防治SARS经验时，特别强调了对专家的倚重。
In summing up the experience of preventing and treating SARS in Shanghai, Liu Jun put special emphasis on experts.
在疫情发生之初，上海市卫生局即成立了由20名各科专家组成的委员会。
In the early days of the outbreak, the Shanghai Health Bureau set up a committee of 20 experts from various disciplines.
在城市防病形势的分析研判、防病策略实施以及技术要点制定上，专家委员会都起到了举足轻重的作用。
The expert committee plays an important role in the analysis and evaluation of urban disease prevention situation, the implementation of disease prevention strategies and the formulation of technical points.
专家们针对不同级别的医疗机构，进行了不同层面的业务培训，也为SARS防治储备了充足的医疗力量。
Specialists have conducted different levels of operational training for different levels of medical institutions and have built up sufficient medical capacity for SARS prevention and treatment.
2003年5月下旬，SARS疫情已发展到后期，上海市一位专家表示，上海之所以能阻止疫情蔓延，是由于全市铸造了三根“链条”。
In late May 2003, when the SARS epidemic reached a late stage, a Shanghai expert said the city had forged three "chains" to stop the spread of the disease.
一是以市民个体为代表的社会链，二是以政府公务员及公共管理部门为代表的制度链，三是以医学专家为代表的医学链。
The first is the social chain represented by the individual citizen, the second is the system chain represented by the government civil servants and the public administration departments, and the third is the medical chain represented by medical experts.
三者同属一线。
All three belong to the same line.
1988年甲肝大流行，面对疫情的前车之鉴最值得一提的，是以市民个体为代表的社会链。
In 1988, hepatitis A pandemic, the most noteworthy example of the epidemic is the social chain represented by individual citizens.
与之直接接触的，便是上海市的基层社区卫生网络。
In direct contact with it is the grass-roots community health network in Shanghai.
上海这一网络的建立健全，得益于1988年的一场肝炎疫情。
The establishment of the Shanghai network benefited from an outbreak of hepatitis in 1988.
那年自1月起，上海市民中突然出现不明原因的发热、呕吐、厌食、乏力和黄疸等症状的病例，后证明是由于市民生食了受到甲肝病毒污染的毛蚶引起。
Since January of that year, Shanghai residents suddenly developed unexplained symptoms of fever, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue and jaundice, which turned out to be caused by eating raw cockles contaminated with hepatitis A virus.
此次疫情持续时间超过2个月，共计造成31万余人感染，31人死亡，给当时的上海卫生防疫系统带来很大压力。
The epidemic, which lasted more than two months, infected more than 310,000 people and killed 31, putting great pressure on the health and epidemic prevention system in Shanghai at the time.
当时上海市所有的内外科病房，总计5.5万张病床，而甲肝病人数以万计，医院病床严重不足。
There were a total of 55,000 beds in all surgical wards in Shanghai and tens of thousands of patients with hepatitis A, with seriously inadequate hospital beds.
“医院住不下了，最后居委会的车棚都被改造成临时隔离病房。
"Hospitals are no longer able to live, and the neighborhood hangars have been converted into temporary isolation wards.
”曾经历了当年甲肝疫情的上海居民回忆道。
Shanghai residents who experienced the hepatitis A epidemic recalled.
这场疫情使上海市政府开始重视突发传染病疫情的防控，并逐步建立了传染病的防控应急预警机制。
This epidemic situation caused the Shanghai Municipal Government to pay attention to the prevention and control of the outbreak of infectious diseases and gradually set up an emergency prevention and early warning mechanism.
1996年，上海市在全国率先成立了市卫生局卫生监督所，1998年又在全国率先成立了市疾病预防控制中心（CDC）。
In 1996, Shanghai took the lead in establishing the Municipal Health Bureau Sanitary Supervision Bureau, and in 1998, the Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was established.
1998年起，全市低端医院分步实现向社区卫生服务中心的职能转变。
Since 1998, the low-end hospitals in the city have gradually transformed their functions into community health service centers.
截至2003年8月，上海市共有预防保健机构89个，三级和二级公立医院167家，社区卫生服务中心101家、乡镇卫生院128家。
As of August 2003, Shanghai had 89 preventive health-care institutions, 167 tertiary and secondary public hospitals, 101 community health service centres and 128 township hospitals.
这也意味着，上海市公共卫生机构功能由传染病防治向传染病和慢性非传染性疾病防治并重拓展，构建起了由疾病预防体系、医疗服务体系和卫生监督体系组成的公共卫生体系框架。
This means that the functions of public health institutions in Shanghai have been expanded from the control of infectious diseases to the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases and chronic non-communicable diseases, and a public health system composed of a disease prevention system, a medical service system and a health supervision system has been established.
“而在其他城市，社区卫生服务中心大多都已经实现了市场化发展，所以在重大疫情事件来临时，无法做到像上海这样的基层社区响应。
"In other cities, the majority of community health service centers have already achieved market-based development, so when major epidemic events come along, grass-roots communities like Shanghai can't respond.
”一位公共卫生专家如是说。
"said one public health expert.
