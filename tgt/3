身处「风暴中心」，从慌乱到乐观，她的心理发生了什么样的变化？让我们一起来看看她过去一周的生活。
In the middle of the storm, what happens to her psyche, from panic to optimism? Let's take a look at her past week.
··············· 返乡我住在汉口，离华南海鲜市场非常近。
I live in Hankou, which is very near the South China seafood market.
22号下午，我踏上回汉口的高铁，神经一直绷得紧紧的，全程戴着医用外科口罩和N95。
On the afternoon of the 22nd, I stepped onto the high-speed train back to Hankou, my nerves always tight, wearing a medical surgical mask and N95.
身边的小孩子闹着不戴口罩，四面八方总是传来咳嗽声。
The children around us are wearing masks, and coughing is always coming from all directions.
这是从北京回武汉的车，基本上是安全的，但是每一声咳嗽声响起时，我就感觉心脏重重地跳了一下。
It was a bus from Beijing back to Wuhan, basically safe, but every time it coughed, I felt my heart beat a lot.
到了汉口时，我所在的车厢只剩下三个人。
By the time Hankou arrived, there were only three people left in my compartment.
出了动车，我感觉自己非常焦虑，旁边的男人立即戴上了手套，可是我却找不到自己备着的橡胶手套。
When I got out of the car, I felt very anxious. The man next to me put on his gloves immediately, but I couldn't find the rubber gloves I had.
华南海鲜市场离汉口火车站直线距离就800米左右，在看了那么多在武汉转车就感染的消息后我已经控制不住自己的情绪了。
South China Seafood Market is about 800 meters away from Hankou Railway Station, I can't control my mood after seeing so much news about the infection in Wuhan.
行李很重，只能拖一会歇一会，根本不可能快速离开车站。
The luggage was so heavy that it was impossible to get out of the station quickly but to take a rest.
在火车站广场还迷路了，问路时保安离我稍微近一点都让我很慌。
I lost my way in the station plaza, and the security guard was a little too close to me when I asked for directions.
火车站旁有人在推销酒店，其中几位依然不戴口罩、抽烟，还随地吐痰。
People were selling hotels near the train station, and several of them were still wearing masks, smoking and spitting.
我拖着快到胸口的行李在火车站四处找我妈的车，拖不动了，行李箱失了平衡，直直地往地下倒。
I dragged my chest of luggage around the train station looking for my mother's car. I couldn't drag it. The luggage got out of balance and fell straight down.
旁边的人都带着口罩坐着车匆匆离去，我在马路口迷失方向焦急万分，心一直跳得飞快，不断喘气。
The people next to me are wearing masks in the car to leave in a hurry, I lost the road in the direction of anxiety, heart has been jumping fast, gasping for breath.
看到一个年轻小伙子穿着全套防护服神色轻松走过时，我想：“为什么我不买一套防护服全副武装回家？”那天的汉口街头，已经没有什么人了。
When I saw a young man in full protective clothing walking by with ease, I thought, "Why don't I buy a suit and go home armed?" Hankou street that day, there were no more people.
封城23号凌晨三点，我睁开眼睛，看到的第一个消息便是封城——在我回到武汉的第三个小时，23号凌晨2点，武汉发布了封城的消息。
The first thing I saw when I opened my eyes at 3 a.m. on the 23rd of this city was the sealing of the city, which was announced by Wuhan at 2 a.m., the third hour after my return to Wuhan.
我把家人叫醒出去买物资，但是他们并没有那么在意，准备天亮了再出发，我开始搜索附近的24小时便利店叫外卖，店员告诉我，封城的消息一发出来，店里的东西便被抢光了——这时距离封城仅仅过了一小时。
I woke up my family to buy things, but they weren't so concerned and were ready to start at dawn. I began searching the nearby 24-hour convenience store for takeaway food. The clerk told me that when the news came out, everything in the store had been looted - only an hour after the city was closed.
朋友的妈妈是协和的护士，她马上也要赶往战场，为了防止传染给丈夫和女儿，阿姨已经准备不回家了；大学同学的妈妈发烧到38.5℃，在七医院、陆总之间两边赶，确诊了病毒肺后只能回家隔离；高中同桌的姨妈也确诊了，居家隔离甚至买不到消毒用品……身边人的消息涌来，让我揪心。
My friend's mother was a Concorde nurse, and she was ready to go home too. To prevent transmission to her husband and daughter, Auntie was ready to go home. The mother of a college classmate developed fever to 38.5 degrees Celsius.
封城当天我不停刷微博看消息，印象最深的一个视频是一个老爹爹发烧发得腿都直了依然住不了院，女儿抱不动她的老父亲，绝望地大喊“我也在发烧啊……”。
The most impressive video was an old father with a fever that kept his legs straight and could not live in the hospital. The daughter could not hold her old father in her arms and cried out in despair, "I have a fever, too..."
晚上，我的嗓子开始发痒，手臂酸痛。
At night, my throat began to itch and my arm ached.
我安慰自己，这几天这么累，咽炎发作是正常的，手臂酸痛是因为行李箱太重了我又拉了一路……但是又好害怕，躲在被子里哭，如果我真的在汉口站被传染了，会不会传染给家人？我想把自己隔离起来，但是我妈又说只是咽炎而已，没有在意。
I comfort myself, these days so tired, pharyngitis attack is normal, arm ache because the luggage too heavy I pull all the way... but also very scared, hiding in the quilt crying, if I was really infected at Hankou Station, will I infect my family? I wanted to isolate myself, but my mother said it was pharyngitis.
我怕出现发烧或者其他的症状，每天数着潜伏期。
I'm afraid of a fever or other symptoms. Count the incubation period every day.
封城的当天，慌张的情绪淹没了我，甚至觉得自己在等死。
On the day of the city's closure, I was overwhelmed by panic and even felt that I was waiting to die.
现在看来，我当时的心理已经出了问题。
Now it seems that my mind was out of whack.
除夕这是我过得最安静的除夕。
It was the quietest New Year's Eve for me.
窗外没有任何声响，到处都是静悄悄的，我在床上躺了一整天。
There was no sound outside the window. It was quiet everywhere. I lay in bed all day.
爸爸问我还能不能买到口罩，我在淘宝、京东、1688上找了好久，在有大量存货的店下单了上千元的口罩，但是刷微博后又得知那些店可能是假的、不顶用的，只能申请退款。
My father asked me if I could buy a mask. I searched Taobao, Jingdong and 1688 for a long time. I ordered a thousand-dollar mask at a store with a large stock.
反反复复地下单退款已经让人变得麻木。
Repeated back-and-forth refunds have become numb.
爷爷奶奶住在协和家属区，那里已经有很多医护人员感染了，我和爸爸不停劝说他们搬离协和，但就是说不动。
My grandparents lived in the Concorde area, where there had been a lot of infections, and Dad and I kept trying to persuade them to move away from Concorde, but not to move.
我只感到深深的无力与疲惫。
I just feel very weak and tired.
而那些在微博上、微信群里疯传的不断有人在街头在医院倒下的视频，不论真假，都让人越来越担心。
Video, real or false, of people falling down in hospitals on microblogs and in small groups is becoming increasingly worrisome.
春晚开始了，如果没有这场疫情，我应该开开心心地吃着年夜饭，看着我喜欢的明星表演节目，跟着电视唱歌。
Spring Festival Gala began, if not for the outbreak, I should be happy to eat New Year's Eve dinner, watching my favorite star show, singing along with the TV.
现在看着热搜上不断增加的病例和各家医院物资紧缺、医护人员不堪重负的消息，觉得有些难过。
It's hard to watch the news of a growing number of cases and hospitals running short of supplies and overburdened doctors and nurses.
十点之后，或许是心理原因，我开始发抖，全身无力，喝了止咳糖浆，早早睡下。
After ten o'clock, perhaps for psychological reasons, I began to tremble, weak, drank cough syrup, and went to bed early.
新年快乐自从回家之后，我的心态一直不好，嗓子发痒后绝望的情绪更是不停蔓延，我知道自己的心态出现了问题，根本控制不住情绪。
Happy New Year Since coming home, my state of mind has not been good, after the throat itchy despair mood is more and more non-stop spread, I know my mentality has gone wrong, simply unable to control emotions.
我强迫自己冷静下来，放下手机睡觉，或者看一些好的消息使自己乐观一些。
I force myself to calm down, put my cell phone down to sleep, or watch some good news to cheer me up.
庆幸的是，从大年初一开始，好消息开始不断出现。
Fortunately, from the beginning of the New Year, the good news began to appear.
让我从阴影之中走出来的是那些“轻度患者在家隔离更安全”“周宁医生自我隔离四天好转”之类的消息。
What got me out of the shadows was the news that "it's safer for the mildly ill to be isolated at home" "Dr. Zhou Ning is self-isolated for four days."
我把央视新闻发的感染病例和死亡病例看了很多遍，确定重症甚至死亡病例多是身体不好、有基础病症的老人，心态才开始逐渐乐观，也强迫自己乐观起来——毕竟乐观的心态对自身免疫力的提高有积极作用。
I've read CCTV's news stories of infections and deaths many times, confirming that the most serious cases, even deaths, are among people with poor health and underlying illnesses, who are starting to feel optimistic and forced to feel optimistic about themselves, after all, having a positive effect on their immune system.
妈妈怕我躺久了头晕难受，强制我和她一起在客厅里唱歌跳舞，《野狼disco》《失恋阵线联盟》《let’s disco》《华夏》《青春舞曲》《冬天里的一把火》……什么歌最欢快就唱什么跳什么。
My mother, afraid of my dizziness and discomfort, forced me to sing and dance with her in the living room. "Wolf Disco," "The Lovelorn Front Coalition," "Chinese Summer," "Youth Dance" and "A Fire in Winter.
我把电视打开，调到东方卫视，看朱一龙表演，跟着他一块儿唱，摇摆，尖叫，来了一场彻彻底底的宣泄，压抑的心情终于得到了缓解。
I turned the TV on, turned it on to Oriental TV, watched Zhu Yilong perform, sang, swung, screamed with him, came a thorough catharsis, finally relieved the depression.
今天的热搜榜上，“武汉未来3天或将开放5000张床位”“正月十五前武汉疫情可能出现拐点”等好消息，让我们这些武汉市民有了更大的希望。
"Wuhan may open 5,000 beds in the next three days" Good news, such as the "possible inflection point of Wuhan before the 15th day of the first month," has given us Wuhan people more hope.
就在刚刚，朋友告诉我，她妈妈的朋友圈里，喊物资短缺的同事已经少了很多，协和医院11位之前确诊感染的医护人员病毒核酸也已经转为阴性，这里面很多都是阿姨熟悉的人，他们的恢复，一定能提高士气。
Just a few moments ago, my friend told me that her mother's circle of friends already had fewer colleagues calling for shortages, and that the 11 Concorde hospital staff who had been diagnosed with infection had turned negative for viral nucleic acids, many of whom were aunts familiar with, and whose recovery would certainly boost morale.
写下这段文字的时候，外面传来了鞭炮声，曾经让我烦躁的“噼里啪啦”声为这座被封锁的城市带来了一些喜庆。
As I wrote this, firecrackers were heard from outside, and the crackling sound that had rattled me brought some cheer to the blockaded city.
今天是封城第四天，大年初二，苦中作乐的武汉人隔着窗户和对面楼嬉笑怒骂，我和妈妈在客厅里跳舞打发时间。
Today is the fourth day of the city, the second day of the New Year, the hard-working Wuhan people across the window and across the floor, my mother and I dance in the living room to kill time.
我不知道这种日子还会持续多久，只希望短点、再短点。
I don't know how long these days are going to last, just short and short.
我好想去江汉路happy站台吃一品烤翅王，去国广喝喜茶，去雪松路吃今楚汤包老街烧烤靓靓蒸虾，去粮道街吃油饼包烧麦，到家附近的小店吃热干面，然后再到东湖绿道骑车骑个痛快……我爱这座城市，我希望她快点好起来，全国都快点好起来。
I really want to go to happy platform to eat a pint of pineapple King, to Guoguang tea, to Cedar Road to eat Chu old street barbecue steamed shrimp, to eat bread and barbecue in grain street, to eat hot-and-dry noodles near home, and then ride a bike to the East Lake green road.
