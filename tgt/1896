文| 吴楠投稿邮箱 | gayspot_edit@163.com1月27日14时16分，吕默在朋友圈发了一条视频，拍摄的是湖北武汉盘龙城大桥的封桥状况：将近三十个红色一米高的塑料灌沙路挡排成一排，阻挡住几乎空荡荡的车道。
At 1416 hours on 27 January, Wu Nan sent a video about the closure of the Pan Long City Bridge in Wuhan, Hubei Province: nearly 30 red one-meter-high plastic sand roads lined up to block nearly empty lanes.
立刻有朋友在微信上询问，“昨天不是还可以从这条路去金银潭医院的吗？”吕默用武汉话回答，“是啊！据说是上午封的。
A friend immediately asked in a letter, "Isn't this the way to the gold and silver pool hospital yesterday?" Rumei replied in Wuhan, "Yes, it is said that it was sealed in the morning.
去机场的路也封了。
The road to the airport is closed.
”这是武汉继1月23日发出封城通知后，进一步在市内各区之间的交通入口处设置了封闭，以期能够进一步减少各区之间的人员流动、更加迅速地控制住新型冠状病毒引发的肺炎疫情。
Following the January 23 closure, Wuhan further closed traffic entrances between districts in the city in an attempt to further reduce the flow of people between districts and bring the new coronavirus-related pneumonia under control more quickly.
“没有通行证就不让过。
"Not without a pass.
”这一次的封桥、封区，让吕默不知如何是好，就连微信群里武汉同志中心的工作人员Barry也焦急起来，他对吕默说，“如果没有通行证，是不是还有其他的办法？”吕默朝着盘龙城大桥的另一端望着。
Even Barry, a member of the Wuhan Comrade Center in the micro-mail crowd, worried about the closure and sealing of the area, told Lemmer, "Is there any other way out if you don't have a pass?"
今天，他是作为HIV感染者的爱心车队，载着两名感染者去武汉市艾滋病定点医院金银潭医院取药的。
Today, he is HIV-infected as the love of the convoy, carrying two infected people to Wuhan AIDS Dingtan Hospital to get medicine.
而金银潭医院就在盘龙城大桥的另一端。
The Gold and Silver Pool Hospital is on the other side of the Panglong Bridge.
但此刻吕默的眼前，除了灰蒙蒙的天气外，似乎什么都看不到。
But there seemed to be nothing in Lemmer's eyes now, except for the gray weather.
求救电话1月23日，武汉宣布封城。
On January 23, Wuhan announced the closure of the city.
显然，很多人都没有料到这一次的决策来得如此迅速，让人措手不及。
Obviously, many people did not expect that this time the decision came so quickly that it took people by surprise.
对于大部分人来说，封城意味着不能回家过年，需要退票；赶快补买年货，准备年夜饭；公共交通停运，出门不太方便……而对于极少数的人来说，却可能意味着不能及时得到救命的药物，让今后的治疗成了扼喉之痛。
For most people, sealing a city means not being able to go home for the New Year and needing a refund; buying new year's food quickly and preparing for New Year's Eve meals; public transportation is out of business and travel is not convenient... for the few, it may mean not getting life-saving drugs in time to make future treatments a choke point.
比如慢性病患者，比如艾滋病感染者。
Take the chronically ill, such as people living with AIDS.
1月23日，封城消息发出没有多久，Barry就收到了一位感染者的救助电话，“我从外地回到武汉过年，药没带够，现在还封城了，人走不了、药却吃没了，怎么办！”对于艾滋病感染者来说，每一个人都非常珍惜正在服用的药物组合。
On January 23, shortly after the news of the siege, Barry received a telephone call from an infected person: "I returned to Wuhan for the New Year. I didn't have enough medicine.
很多感染者从最初以周为单位尝试是否能够和药物匹配，再逐步到半个月领取一次药物进行巩固，然后是一个月领取一次，最后是三个月领取一次。
Many infected people try to match the drug initially on a weekly basis, then gradually receive it every half month for consolidation, then once a month, and finally once every three months.
循序渐进的过程，让药物组合和人体匹配并固定下来，几乎所有的感染者都会将服药的时间精确到几点几分。
Step by step, the drug combination and the human body match and fixed down, almost all infected people will take the time to accurate a few minutes.
虽然医学上有种说法，认为前后可以浮动十五分钟的服药时差，但不会有人真的愿意冒险去尝试。
Although there is a medical saying that you can float a 15-minute time difference in medication, no one is really willing to take the risk.
一旦耐药，运气好一些，是某一款药物需要更换。
Once resistance is present and luck is better, a particular drug needs to be replaced.
更多的时候，耐药意味着对同样药理的一系列药物的耐药。
More often than not, drug resistance means resistance to a range of drugs that share the same pharmacology.
也因此，意味着在国内对艾滋病感染者提供的免费药物中可以选的药物组合就更少了。
As a result, this means that fewer drug combinations are available for free treatment of people living with AIDS in the country.
不需要任何人提醒，感染者都明白，停药、断药，意味着耐药的可能性极大地提升。
No one needs to remind, infected people understand that stopping drugs, drugs, means that the likelihood of drug resistance greatly increased.
而耐药，意味着生命直面危险。
Resistance means that life faces danger head on.
武汉封城后，随后短时间内，黄冈、鄂州、赤壁、仙桃、潜江市等湖北其他城市也相继发布通告，宣布不同程度停运城市公共交通。
Wuhan after the closure of the city, and then for a short time, Huanggang, Huizhou, Chibi, Xiantao, Qianjiang City and other cities in Hubei Province have also issued notices announcing different levels of urban public transportation.
在接下来不到两天的时间，中国绝大部分的省份纷纷启动“重大突发公共卫生事件I级响应”。
In less than two days, the vast majority of China's provinces have launched "major public health emergencies I response."
封城、封镇、封村，似乎成了全国各地不约而同的举动。
Sealing the city, sealing the town, sealing the village, seems to have become the same throughout the country.
而武汉同志中心的艾滋病感染者咨询与关怀电话成了热线，面对这样的突发状况，数百人在拨打“求救”电话。
Wuhan gay center of the AIDS counselling and care telephone became a hotline, facing such a sudden situation, hundreds of people in the "call for help."
原本只有2名负责艾滋病感染者方面工作的员工，无法应对每天大量的咨询电话，武汉同志中心迅速将工作人员增加到了8个人。
With only two staff members working with people living with HIV, unable to cope with the large number of daily calls, Wuhan Gay Center quickly increased its staff to eight.
“就算这样，每天每个人都要处理四五十个感染者的咨询、干预、协助和心理支持。
"Even so, every person has to deal with counselling, intervention, assistance and psychological support for forty or fifty infected people every day.
工作压力超乎我们的预计。
The pressure of the work exceeded our expectations.
”负责人黄先生说。
"said the official.
“那我只能打110了”封闭，让无论城市还是村落，都呈现出一种电影中才会出现的场景：空无一人，店铺关闭，主路上有人把守。
"Then I can only call 110" closed, so that both the city and the village, a film will appear in the scene: empty, shops closed, the main road guarded.
而对于感染者来说，生活态势比吃不上饭还要严峻，他们吃不上救命的药。
For the infected, life is worse than lack of food, they do not have access to life-saving drugs.
一位困在湖北黄冈村落里的感染者家明第三次发来求救，“明天我就断药了！”当从外地赶回家过年的他连着打了两天的县疾控中心防艾科的电话，都无人接听时，家明整个人不知所措，“我们村子都封了，村干部带着人在路上堵着，外面的人不许进，里面的人出不去。
"Tomorrow I'll be out of medicine!" As he raced home for two days to answer the phone call from the county CDC's anti-Aiko, no one answered. "Our village is sealed, the village cadres are blocked with people on the road, people from outside are not allowed to go out."
”在某种程度上来说，家明是幸运的。
In a way, Jiamin is lucky.
他有车，这是他在后来能够快速出村的基础条件。
He had a car, which was the basis on which he was able to leave the village quickly afterwards.
而且在Barry等工作人者的指导下，他大胆尝试和村口把守的干部沟通，“我有糖尿病，要去医院开药，不然要出人命的！”这个村没有像其他一些极端的村落那样用石头树木堵路，只是村干部带着村民在路口执勤。
And under the guidance of his fellow workers, Barry and others, he ventured to communicate with the village guards, "I have diabetes, I'm going to the hospital to prescribe drugs or die!"
人总是可以沟通的。
People can always communicate.
家明苦苦哀求，终于被放行后，他一路加速开到县里。
After he was finally released, he sped all the way to the county.
“没想到县疾控的防艾科根本没人！”家明到了疾控中心才知道，医生和工作人员都被调往预防和管控新型冠状病毒引发的肺炎工作当中。
"I did not expect the county CDC Aiko no one!" Jiaming to the CDC only to know that doctors and staff were transferred to the prevention and management of the new coronavirus-induced pneumonia.
“实际上，就算是平常的春节，很多疾控中心防艾科的工作人员都要到初七以后才上班，而他们也会提醒感染者提前取药。
"In fact, even during the Spring Festival, many CDC staff do not go to work until after the seventh day of junior high school, and they will remind infected people to get their medicine in advance.
”Barry说。
"said Barry.
但提前取药并不意味着感染者在回家过年的时候，也会携带一个月以上的药量。
But early withdrawal does not mean that the infected person will go home to celebrate the New Year, will also carry more than a month of medicine.
这么多的药物随身携带，很容易会被家人发现自己是艾滋病感染者。
With so much medicine at hand, it's easy for family members to find themselves infected with AIDS.
在大部分情况下，感染者都会计算一下在家停留的时间，在此基础上多携带两到三天的药量。
In most cases, the infected person calculates the amount of time spent at home, and on that basis carries an additional two to three days of medication.
家明已经被停药、耐药的恐惧、焦虑逼到了死胡同，仿佛有一把枪顶在太阳穴上，“我是一定要拿到药的。
Jiamei Ming has been stopped, drug-resistant fear, anxiety into a dead end, as if a gun in the temple, "I must get the medicine.
”家明对留在疾控中心值班的工作人员说，“求你帮我想想办法。
"Please help me do something about it," he told the staff on duty at the CDC.
”“不是不想办法，而是大家都去抵抗疫情了。
"Not that we can do anything about it, but that everyone is fighting the epidemic.
”工作人员似乎并不能理解面前的这个小伙子在大冬天急得满头是汗，似乎也有点怪他不懂得状况、现在还来添乱。
The staff did not seem to understand that the young man in front of him was sweating with impatience in the winter, and seemed to blame him for not knowing the situation and now adding to the confusion.
“如果不帮我联系，那我只能打110了。
"If I don't get in touch, I'll just have to call 110.
家明使出了最后一招。
Daming did the last trick.
这也是很多感染者被逼到无奈的被迫之举。
This is also a lot of infected people have been forced into helplessness.
看起来有些无赖，但大部分情况下是有效的。
It may seem like a scoundrel, but it works most of the time.
不知道是因为要拨打110让值班人员感觉到紧张，还是因为家明的语气让值班人员感觉到这个小伙子不会善罢甘休，在值班人员联系了领导、安排了相关的医生后，在即将断药前的六个小时，家明终于拿到了可以坚持10天的药物。
Whether it was because he had to call 110 to make the duty officer nervous or because his voice told the staff that he would not give up, Ka Ming was finally given the medicine for 10 days after the duty officer contacted the leader and arranged for the doctor.
“我们只是告诉他一些可以做的事情和方法，但归根结底还是要他去争取。
"We just tell him what he can do and how to do it, but ultimately it's up to him to do it.
”实际上，这并不是某一位工作人员的办法，而是所有处理即将断药的艾滋病感染者的棘手案例的工作人员，在微信群里一起分析、集智、探讨，最后想出来的办法。
In fact, this is not the approach of one staff member, but of all the staff dealing with the thorny cases of people living with AIDS who are about to lose their medication, who come together in a small group of micro-letters to analyse, brainstorm, explore and come up with solutions.
这几乎是人被逼到死胡同里的求生本能。
It is almost a survival instinct driven into a blind alley.
爱心车队2020年春节的新冠肺炎疫情，无形中把艾滋病感染者划分为两类。
Love team 2020 Spring Festival New Crown Pneumonia outbreak, the AIDS-infected people are divided into two categories.
一类是被困在湖北省内的。
One is trapped in Hubei province.
无论是平时在湖北地区生活和取药，还是从外地来到湖北过年的感染者，基本上无一例外都被困在了湖北省。
No matter living and collecting medicine in Hubei area, or coming from other places to Hubei New Year's Eve, basically all of them are trapped in Hubei Province.
另一类是从湖北离开的感染者。
One is an infected person who left Hubei.
这一部分感染者几乎分散到了全国各地。
This segment of the infected population is spread almost throughout the country.
而作为“九省通衢”的武汉，因为封闭或者隔离而不能及时得到药物的感染者也不在少数。
Wuhan, which is a thoroughfare of nine provinces, has many infected people who cannot get medicines in time because they are closed or isolated.
“1月25日、26日还好一些。
January 25th and 26th are better.
”吕默说。
'he said.
他是武汉同志中心在1月24日成立的爱心车队中的一员。
He was part of a team set up by the Wuhan Comrade Center on January 24.
从1月25日开始，在武汉本地工作的他由于自身也是一名艾滋病感染者，“加上我有车，出去比较方便一些。
From January 25, he works in Wuhan, because he is also a person infected with AIDS, "plus I have a car, it is more convenient to go out.
武汉这个城市太大了，现在又忽然封城，各种公共交通都没有。
Wuhan is too big a city, and now suddenly closed the city, all kinds of public transport are not.
难道要让这些感染者走路或者骑车去取药吗？”实际上，吕默从1月24日开始就已经作为爱心司机在送两名医护人员上班。
Should these infected people walk or ride their bikes to get their medicine? "In fact, Lümer has been delivering two paramedics to work as a caring driver since January 24.
第一位是一名女医生，是吕默同事的朋友。
The first was a female doctor, a friend of Lemmer's colleagues.
“我住在盘龙城，她住在汉口。
"I live in Panlong City. She lives in Hankou.
开到她家那里差不多要半个小时。
It took almost half an hour to get to her house.
封城、加上夜里路上没有什么人，所以开得能快一些。
With no one on the road at night, they drove faster.
毕竟她是医生，要去医院救人的嘛。
After all, she's a doctor. She's going to the hospital to save lives.
”第二次送的是一个男医生。
"The second was a male doctor.
恰好那天盘龙城大桥封闭了。
It happened that day that the Panglong Bridge was closed.
“我也搞不清楚大桥的封闭规律。
"I don't know how the bridge is closed, either.
我们两个都没有通行证。
Neither of us has a pass.
”幸运的是医生拿出了自己的工作证，负责封闭大桥的工作人员让医生走路过桥，吕默的车是无论如何都不能通行的。
Fortunately, the doctor produced his work permit, and the staff responsible for closing the bridge had the doctor walk across the bridge.
也许这些医护人员根本就没有想过，身边这个开着车、脸上戴着护目镜和口罩、根本看不清长相的小伙子会是一名艾滋病感染者。
Perhaps these medical staff did not think that the side of the car, wearing goggles and masks, do not see the face of the young man will be a person infected with AIDS.
“不用说什么做不做贡献的，我觉得能出一点力就蛮好。
It goes without saying that it is good to be able to do something without making a contribution.
”话虽这样说，但吕默并不敢让自己的父母知道，他出去开车是送病友取药。
"That said, Lemmer didn't dare to let his parents know that he was going out to get the medicine from his sick friend.
吕默每次出来都要换一次口罩，在回家之前还要用酒精喷洒消毒。
Lemmer changed his mask every time he came out and sprayed it with alcohol before he went home.
最开始做爱心车队的前两天，他并没有算计这些。
The first two days as a loving team, he did not calculate this.
到了第三天，他意识到这样下去，自己的口罩和酒精可能很快就要用光。
On the third day, he realized that his mask and alcohol might soon run out.
而现在口罩属于最紧缺最宝贵的资源。
Now masks are among the most scarce and valuable resources.
据说一度一副口罩的价格被炒作到几乎接近了半克黄金！于是，吕默和爱心车队微信群里需要帮助的病友们商量，能不能大家集中起来，这样也减少自己频繁外出的成本、降低感染疫情的风险。
At one point, it was said, a pair of masks was almost half a gram of gold! So Mr. Rümer discussed with his fellow patients in need of help at the Loving Caravan, whether they could be grouped together to reduce the cost of frequent trips and reduce the risk of infection.
“最多的一次带了三个病友去取药。
"Most often I bring three sick people to get the medicine.
”那是1月27日，吕默为了节省口罩，先带老妈去超市补充了一些蔬菜和日用品。
On January 27, Lemmer took his mother to the supermarket to replenish her supply of vegetables and groceries to save on her mask.
回来后，他让妈妈先上楼，自己则在楼下呆一会儿。
When he came back, he told his mother to go upstairs first and stay downstairs for a while.
看老妈进了电梯，吕默急忙跳上车，在接下来的一个小时里，分别接上了位于武汉不同地点的三个病友，随后送至金银潭医院。
Seeing Mom get into the elevator, Lv Mo jumped into the car and, for the next hour, connected three sick friends from different places in Wuhan and took them to the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital.
不巧的是当天盘龙城大桥封闭了。
Unfortunately, the Pan Long City Bridge was closed that day.
实际上从那天起，盘龙城大桥便一直处于封闭状态。
In fact, since that day, Panlong City Bridge has been in a closed state.
“走二环行不行？三环呢？”吕默在车友群里开始问路。
"Wouldn't it be all right to take the Second Ring Road?" Lv Mo began to ask the way among his fellow drivers.
幸运的是，三个病友中有一个是有通行证的。
Fortunately, one of the three patients had a pass.
这位有通行证的病友步行过桥去金银潭医院替另外两个病友都取到了药。
The patient with the pass walked across the bridge to the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital to get medicine for the other two patients.
武汉街头的车辆越来越少。
Wuhan has fewer and fewer vehicles on the streets.
有人说，很多时候只能听见救护车在空荡荡的大街上尖叫着开过。
Many times, it was said, ambulances could only be heard screaming in the empty streets.
而从1月31日起，吕默就一直没有出车，“不敢出去了呀！据说被摄像头拍到是要扣分的。
Since Jan. 31, Rümer has been out of the car, "afraid to go out!" The camera is said to be to deduct points.
”而这样的消息并不是只有他一个人在讲，但仍难确定真伪。
He was not alone in telling the story, but it was difficult to determine whether it was true or not.
如何告诉家人1月26日，中国疾控中心发布了《关于保障异地滞留艾滋病病毒感染者免费抗病毒治疗药品的通知》。
On January 26, China's CDC issued the Notice on Guaranteeing Free Antiviral Therapeutic Drugs for People Living with HIV / AIDS in Other Places.
这让武汉同志中心的负责人黄先生松了口气，“国家发了这样的通知，让很多感染者在下一步的取药过程中，多少是能够方便一些的。
This let the head of the Wuhan Comrade Center Mr. Huang relaxed, "the state issued such a notice, so that many infected people in the next step in the process, how much is more convenient.
”从1月23日起，武汉同志中心的工作人员既和本地外地的疾病预防控制中心，也和各地的同志社群关爱组织联系，在多方协助下，他们将艾滋病感染者异地取药所需要的申请材料和证明材料进行了整理，并提供给需要的感染者。
Since January 23, Wuhan gay center staff have contacted local centers for disease control and prevention, as well as gay community care groups around the country, and with the help of many people, they have sorted out the application materials and testimonials needed by people living with AIDS to get medicine in different places and provided them to those who need them.
这里面包括了感染者本人需要填写的申请书，也有由疾控中心或定点医院提供的证明。
This includes the application form that the infected person needs to fill out, also has the certificate that by the CDC or the appointed point hospital.
但对于封城期间的艾滋病感染者来说，如何突破封城的限制取到药物虽然很难，但最难的是如何面对要告知家人自己感染的事实。
But for people living with AIDS during the siege, how to break the siege of access to drugs, although difficult, but the most difficult to face to inform their families about their infection.
Barry说，截至1月底，武汉同志中心接到近500宗断药求助，其中80%已找到解决办法，“这80%的人要么是能够想办法以其他的病来代替艾滋病，说服家人或者负责封路的工作人员，让自己出去。
By the end of January, Wuhan had received nearly 500 requests for help with drugs, and 80 percent of them had found a solution, Barry said. "These 80 percent of people can either find ways to replace AIDS with other ailments, persuade family members or those responsible for sealing the roads to go out on their own.
要么就是能够想办法，比如自己有车或者有人接应，来到疾控中心或者定点医院。
Or be able to think of ways, such as their own car or someone to answer, to the CDC or point to the hospital.
而剩下的才是最困难的。
The rest is the most difficult.
”在武汉有一位感染者疑似感染了新冠肺炎，因发烧被隔离了。
An infected person suspected of contracting pneumonia in Wuhan has been quarantined with a fever.
“而他的抗艾滋病药物只剩下三四天的量。
"And he only has three or four days left on his anti-AIDS medication.
他家里人看他很紧，不允许他出门。
His family saw him tight and would not allow him to go out.
在这样的情况下，感染者更加着急。
Under such circumstances, infected people are even more anxious.
但最后的决定还是要他自己做。
But the final decision was for him to make.
因为在这种情况下，除非跟自己的父母摊牌，不然是没有办法去领药了。
Because in this case, there is no way to get medicine unless you show up with your parents.
”Barry说这番话的时候非常痛苦。
"Barry said this in great pain.
“绝望”、“无助”、“害怕”，是他这几天感受到的最多的情绪。
"Despair," "helplessness," "fear" are the feelings he has felt the most these days.
“实际上，很多感染者给我们打来电话，咨询的核心问题是他从大城市回到村子和县城，在这样的情况下，就算能够出来取药，也会面临着隐私暴露的危险。
"In fact, a lot of infected people called us and the central question of the consultation was his return from the big city to the village and county, in which case he would be exposed to privacy even if he could get the medicine.
毕竟在小地方，人口数量少，如果不小心取药暴露，很可能就会人尽皆知。
After all, in small places, populations are so small that if they are not carefully exposed, they are likely to be well known.
感染者实际上是很恐惧很抗拒这一点的。
Infected people are actually very scared and resistant to this.
”Barry说，“隐私保护不健全，才是很多感染者心底的顾虑。
"Lack of privacy is a concern for many infected people," Barry said.
”1月31日，武汉同志中心的公号转载了一篇名为《当前不可抗力因素下造成服药中断时该如何处理》的文章。
On January 31, the official journal of Wuhan Gay Center reproduced an article entitled "What to do if medication is interrupted by force majeure."
在黄先生看来，这也是无奈之举，不知道这篇文章会不会让很多人看完后更加紧张，但是也希望能够帮助大家以防万一。
In Mr. Huang's view, this is also helpless, I do not know this article will not let many people after reading more nervous, but also hope to help everyone in case.
而对于Barry来说，每天四五十个求助电话里，终究会有十个左右的感染者没有办法成功取药，而因此面临着停药、断药的危险的，这几乎成为了每一个工作人员内心巨大压力的最主要的来源。
And for Barry, 40 or 50 calls a day, in the end about 10 infected people will not be able to get their medicine, and therefore face the danger of stopping drugs, drugs, this has become almost every staff member's most important source of internal pressure.
1月27日，武汉的天阴沉沉的，上午便开始稀稀拉拉地下起了小雨。
January 27, Wuhan of the sky overcast, the morning began to sparse began to rain.
下楼去倒垃圾的Barry，衣服被冰冷的冬雨打湿了，寒冷的天气让人的身体和心情都极度的不舒服。
Down stairs to empty the garbage Barry, clothes wet from the cold winter rain, cold weather makes the body and mood extremely uncomfortable.
而他的手机时刻都握在手里。
And his cell phone was always in his hand.
那位不能出门、即将断药、不幸又感染新冠肺炎的感染者在微信上一遍又一遍的哀嚎着，“我该怎么办？”“谁来救救我？”那一天也是咨询量达到的最高峰的一天，几乎每一个工作人员都在濒临崩溃的边缘强撑着，为每一个打进电话或者微信咨询的感染者提供支持。
The man who couldn't go out, who was about to lose his medication, and who was unlucky enough to catch the new crown of pneumonia, whined over and over again, "What am I going to do?" "Who's going to save me?"
他们不知道，从第二天，也就是1月28日开始，求助和咨询的电话开始下降。
They did not know that calls for help and advice began to decline the following day, on 28 January.
“因为所有能够取药的感染者都已经开始行动，并得到了药物。
"Because all the infected people who are able to get the drugs have started to do so and have been given drugs.
剩下的人，的确是无法得到药物了。
The rest of us really don't have access to drugs.
因此咨询电话和求助电话的数量开始下降。
As a result, the number of calls and calls began to decline.
”黄先生分析道。
"said Mr. Huang.
借药实际上，除了想方设法前往疾控中心和定点医院取药以外，对于极少部分的感染者来说，还剩下最后一条道路可以选择，那就是借药。
Borrowing Drugs In fact, in addition to finding ways to get medicine at CDC and designated hospitals, for a very small percentage of those infected, there is only one way to go, and that is to borrow drugs.
“借药真的是最后的一种选择。
Borrowing is really the last option.
”Barry说。
"said Barry.
对于大多数感染者来说，如果要借药就要借到一整套的药物组合，比如说最常见的替依拉组合。
For most infected people, a combination of drugs, such as the most common Tereira combination, is needed to borrow the drug.
“几乎不会看到某一位感染者单独去借药物组合中的某一种或借出某一种药，这只能说明他在服药的时候出现了遗漏，导致药物综合中有一种药物数量对不上了。
"It's almost impossible to see an infected person borrowing one of the drug combinations alone or lending a particular drug, only to see an omission in his medication, resulting in a mismatch in the drug mix.
是绝对不会发生医院给感染者多发放药物的情况的。
It is absolutely not the case that the hospital will give more medicine to the infected people.
”也因此每位感染者手中的药物都是按粒计算的。
So the drugs in every infected person's hand are counted by granules.
一开始，为了应对一部分感染者的紧急需求，的确是建立了用于相互借药的微信群，但是在群里很快出现了一些状况。
Initially, in response to the immediate needs of some of those infected, micro-groups for mutual borrowing were indeed created, but a number of situations quickly emerged in the group.
最主要的状况是如何达成借药还药的协议。
The main issue is how to reach an agreement to repay the drug.
在这样的协议中，涉及到很多个人隐私，比如真实的姓名、身份证号、取药代码等。
In such an agreement, a lot of personal privacy is involved, such as the real name, identity number, drug collection code, etc.
因此两个人之间一定要存在信任。
So there has to be trust between two people.
“药都是按天数来的。
The medicine comes by the number of days.
借出去了多久，就意味着自己将会面临多少天没有药可以吃。
Just how long you lend means how many days you will face without medicine.
”换句话说，相当于把别人的风险转嫁到了自己身上。
In other words, it is tantamount to passing on someone else's risk to oneself.
如果一旦出现什么突发状况，很可能就是自己也没有药可以吃、马上就要面临断药的风险。
If there is a sudden situation, it is likely that they do not have their own medicine to eat, immediately facing the risk of drug withdrawal.
武汉同志中心只能协助双方建立联系，接下来的协商和细节，都交由两人私下联系，确认好借药还药的协议内容。
Wuhan Comrade Center can only help the two sides to establish contact, the following consultations and details, both to the private contact, to confirm the content of the drug repayment agreement.
就算有协议，也难免有些风险隐藏着。
Even if there is an agreement, there are some risks hidden.
这和每个人的品性有关系。
It has to do with everyone's character.
但我们愿意相信，每个人都是善良而温暖的。
But we are willing to believe that everyone is kind and warm.
和出借方同时在一个城市内的借药者的情况极为罕见。
It is extremely rare for a borrower to be in the same city as the lender.
大部分情况下，两人都是在不同的省市和地区。
In most cases, both were located in different provinces and regions.
每个愿意出借自己药物的感染者能够借出的药量也不一样。
Each person who is willing to lend their own drugs is able to lend out a different amount of medicine.
最多的也只能达到一个月，少的话大概只有三天到一周。
The most can only reach a month, if less about three days to a week.
“其实借药是一个小概率的事件。
"In fact, borrowing is a low probability event.
首先有人要愿意借，其次你们两个人吃的药物组合还必须是一致的。
First, someone wants to borrow, and second, the combination of drugs you both eat must be the same.
”Barry说。
"said Barry.
借药还要等到快递恢复工作，这也带来了一些时差问题，毕竟从一个城市快递到另外一个城市是需要一些时间的。
Loaning medicine will have to wait until express delivery gets back to work, which also causes some jet lag, since it takes some time to get from one city to another.
但每个即将断药的感染者都在抱着渺茫的希望，不愿放手。
But every infected person about to lose his or her medicine is reluctant to let go in the hope of a distant future.
没有声音的声音封城宛如涟漪，而最终不被察觉的角落可能会更多。
The sound of the voiceless is like a ripple in a city, and there may be more in the unnoticed corner.
不能忽视的是，从1月23日至今，可以发出求救声的感染者几乎都是来自习惯使用社交网络、有着大学学历的青年人，而中老年群体、文化水平较低的农民工等感染者群体，是不知道如何发出自己的声音，甚至不知道渠道在哪里。
It cannot be ignored that, from 23 January to the present, almost all infected persons who can call for help come from young people who are accustomed to using social networks and have university degrees, while groups of infected persons, such as the middle-aged and the elderly and the less educated migrant workers, do not know how to make their voices heard or even where the channels are.
他们可能是更加巨大的一个隐性群体。
They may be a much bigger hidden group.
这样的情况不局限于感染者群体，也包括很多其他的弱势与小众群体，比如慢性病群体。
This situation is not limited to the group of infected persons, but also includes many other vulnerable and small groups, such as the chronically ill.
武汉同志中心的黄先生说，“如果从疫情防治的角度来说，这一次涉及到全国很多城市的封城，可能是最便捷最有效的。
"If we look at the prevention and treatment of the epidemic, this time involving the closure of many cities in the country, it may be the most convenient and effective," said Mr. Huang of the Wuhan Comrade Center.
但无疑这也让很多感染者或者其他的小众人群成为了容易受伤的一个群体。
But there is no doubt that many infected people or other small groups of people become a vulnerable group.
“这一次的封城速度太快了，让我们都措手不及。
"This time the siege was too fast and caught us all by surprise.
作为民间组织，力量还是太弱小了，虽然我们一直希望能够帮政府做得更多一些，但是从目前的效果来看，显然还是不够。
As civil society organizations, we are still too weak, and while we have always hoped to do more for the government, it is clearly not enough.
”更让黄先生心疼的是他的十几名同事，一方面要在家办公的同时，还要承受着封城带来的焦虑和恐慌。
Mr. Huang is even more distressed is his dozen colleagues, on the one hand to work from home, but also to bear the anxiety and panic brought about by the closure.
另一方面还要感同身受着无数个感染者传递过来的压力。
On the other hand we have to feel the pressure of innumerable infected people.
而他们的工作就是竭尽所能地消除这样的压力，并且帮助到更多的感染者。
Their job is to do everything in their power to eliminate this pressure and help more infected people.
但是始终有一部感染者所面临的情况是他们无能为力的。
But there has always been a situation where infected people are powerless.
这涉及到的不仅仅是感染者个人的问题，还涉及到整个社会的医疗、服务、社群等多个角度和层面。
This involves not only the individual infected person's problem, but also the whole society's medical treatment, service, community and so on many angles and dimensions.
在黄先生看来，疫情或许很快就将过去，中国必将战胜这一场“战疫”。
In Mr Huang's view, the epidemic may soon be over, and China will have to overcome it.
但是感染者所承受过的心理压力、大众所面对疫情和封城所带来的心理压力，可能是后续一段时间需要面临和解决的问题。
But the psychological pressure of the infected, that of the public and that of the city, may be the problem to be faced and solved for some time to come.
“尤其是感染者的心理，我们现在也开始着手做一些相关的工作。
"Especially the infected person's psychology, we also started to do some related work now.
”黄先生的语气里透着无奈，“但是我们真的太累了，对于这个，目前的进展大概只能要缓慢一些了。
"But we're really tired," Mr Huang said in a tone of resignation. "At this point, progress may have to be slow.
