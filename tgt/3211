A neighbor of Liu Hong, Li Ping (not his real name), underwent kidney surgery two years ago and developed a rejection at the end of 2019.
过年前，李平的爱人回老家探亲，没想到接下来武汉就封城了，夫妻俩被迫分隔两地。
Before the New Year, Li Ping's wife returned home to visit relatives, did not expect the next Wuhan on the closure of the city, the husband and wife were separated.

Worried about her husband's infection but also in the other place, Li Ping's wife was anxious, "My husband belongs to the susceptible group, usually even the cold are strictly guarded, the epidemic situation is even more difficult.
”刘洪知道了这个情况，主动联系这位邻居，给他凑齐了一包能至少吃两周、内容丰富的爱心菜。
"When Liu Hong learned about the situation, he contacted his neighbor and assembled a package of loving dishes that would last him at least two weeks.
这包爱心菜里都有些什么呢？牛肉——刘洪女儿好不容易大清早在“盒马”抢购到的、蔬菜（白菜、胡萝卜、青椒、黄瓜、豆角等等）——来自社区分发给她家的爱心菜、水果——来自社区志愿者、30枚鸡蛋——住在刘洪家楼下的老爷爷一次性团购了很多匀出来的。

在凑这30枚鸡蛋时，老爷爷硬是不肯收刘洪的钱，说“帮邻居一把不收钱”，但刘洪还是执意要给他。
In the patchwork of 30 eggs, grandpa refused to collect Liu Hong's money, said "to help a neighbor do not receive money," but Liu Hong insisted to give him.

When the package was finished, Chen Qiongfang, a community volunteer, volunteered to deliver food in the group. Chen Qiongfang took twenty jin of vegetables and fruits to the seventh floor in one breath, panting.
李平的妻子说，老公看着小陈一口气拎了那么重的菜上楼，都惊呆了，小陈当时还说，“我不比小伙子的力气差吧，你家里现在菜多，我心里就踏实了！”除了爱心菜，李平在疫情期间还受到了社区自发组织的志愿团队的帮助。
Li Ping's wife said that her husband watched Xiao Chen carrying so much food upstairs and was shocked. "I'm not as strong as a young man," Xiao Chen said at the time. "Besides loving dishes, Li Ping was helped by a volunteer team organized by the community itself during the outbreak.

"Wuhan people want to taste, afraid to cause trouble to others" Liu Hong's downstairs lived an old master, this year in his seventies, and his wife live side by side.
“年纪大了的人，对于智能手机软件一窍不通，在别人的反复指导下，才学会用智能手机打电话和微信转账。
"Older people, ignorant of smartphone software, learn to make phone calls and microphone transfers on smart phones under repeated instructions.
”刘洪说，“但是疫情期间购买物资需要用软件或者微信群聊下单，旁人看来再简单不过的操作却难住了老人家。
"But when it comes to buying supplies during epidemics, we need to use software or micro-letters to place orders," Liu said.
”小区实行封闭式管理后，刘洪每次网购一些物资，也顺便问一下老师傅有什么需要。
"After the implementation of closed management, Liu Hong each time the network to buy some materials, also by the way asked the old master what is needed.
有一次，老人想要买一些盐、面条、肥皂和消毒液，但社区物资购买群只能买食物，刚好刘洪家里有现成的，就把自己家里的肥皂和消毒液打包起来，送给了老人。
Once, the old man wanted to buy some salt, noodles, soap and disinfectant, but the community purchase group could only buy food.
当老人提出要付给刘洪钱时，她赶紧推辞：“哎呀，我只是想做好事，不能变成卖东西撒。
When the old man offered to pay Liu Hong Qian, she quickly declined. "Oh, I just want to do something good.
”尽管这样，老人还是执意要付钱，不仅要给，还每次都要多给。

刘洪不收，微信转账又被退回去，老人就再转。
Liu Hong did not receive, micro-letter transfer was returned, the old man turned again.
来来去去，刘洪“投降”了，她笑着和老人商量：“这样，我们各让一步，你转给我210元，230元我是绝对不会收的。
Liu Hong came and went, "surrendered." She smiled and said to the old man, "Well, let's meet each other half way.
你也安心，我也安心。
You set your mind at ease, and so do I.
”终于和老人达成共识。

刘洪还听说，社区志愿者刘京倩帮一位独自在家带孩子的女士送菜。
Liu also heard that Liu Jingqian, a community volunteer, helps a woman take care of her children at home alone.
那位女士的老公之前去外地工作，又碰上了武汉封城，已经四十多天没能回家，刘京倩知道她一个人照管孩子不方便下楼领物资，就每次都热心地把物资送到她家门口。
The lady's husband had gone to work outside the city, then met Wuhan, has not been able to return home for more than 40 days, Liu Jingqian knew she could not take care of the children downstairs alone, so she enthusiastically delivered the goods to her door every time.
那位女士不知道如何感激刘京倩，就分出自己的一部分物资放在不远的刘京倩家门口。

刘京倩开玩笑说，“我估计这菜放门口放坏了都不会被拿进去。
"I don't think the dish will be taken in if it goes out the door," Liu said jokingly.
”在刘洪口中，这就是武汉人平日里的样子，“武汉人嘛，就是这样，爱面子，要味，喜欢讲客气，生怕给别人添麻烦！但是邻居之间互相搭把手，本来就是应该的嘛。
"In Liu Hong's mouth, this is the way Wuhan people usually do," Wuhan people, it is the case, love face, taste, like to speak politely, afraid to cause trouble to others!
