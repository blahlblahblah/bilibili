2月5日，一条报道了武汉女孩素素的故事，当天微信阅读超过120万。
On February 5, a story about Wuhan girl Su-su was read by more than 1.2 million microletters that day.
她通过自己在家隔离，熬过了这次的新型肺炎，同时，还有更多的人在经历着生离死别。
She managed to survive the new pneumonia by isolating herself at home, while many more were experiencing life and death.
纬纬和妈妈故事发布后，文章中的另一个女孩纬纬当天在后台联系我们，愿意主动分享妈妈的治疗历程。
After the course and mom's story were released, another girl in the article contacted us backstage on the same day, willing to share her treatment experience.
从1月13日住进武昌医院，到2月1日出院，纬纬一家辗转3个科室，经历了将近20天的艰难治疗，最终顺利出院。
He was admitted to Wuchang Hospital on January 13 and was discharged from hospital on February 1. He was discharged from the hospital after nearly 20 days of arduous treatment.
纬纬在妈妈出院那天发的朋友圈她说，我想把我们母女的故事分享出来，给更多的人看到战胜病魔的正能量，告诉大家一定要坚持，只要坚持下去，就能看到希望！郑阿姨和武昌医院医护人员的合影我妈妈刚开始有点不舒服，是在一月初，她觉得有点感冒发烧，是她自己先去的医院，看病打针。
I want to share the story of our mother and daughter, to show more people the positive energy of overcoming the disease, and to tell everyone to persevere, so long as you persevere, you can see hope!
那时候我还开玩笑跟她说，现在新闻都在说什么新型肺炎，你现在要是感冒发烧很敏感了，小心被隔离了。
At the time, I joked to her that the news was all about the new pneumonia, and now you're sensitive to a cold or a fever and are being quarantined.
我是90后，我妈妈是63年的，她退休了以后，经常在八一艺术团参加一些中老年人的演出，身体也还可以，没有慢性病什么的。
I am 90 years old, my mother is 63 years old, she retired, often in the 81 arts troupe to participate in a number of middle-aged and elderly performances, the body is also OK, no chronic diseases and so on.
现在回忆起来，我妈妈可能就是第一次去医院的时候没有防护，被感染的。
In retrospect, my mother probably went to the hospital for the first time without protection and got infected.
1月12日，突然发烧，心慌胸闷，隔天住进武昌医院从医院回来后我妈本来已经感冒康复，过了两三天，1月12日左右她又发烧了，这次发烧她感觉特别心慌胸闷，心脏特别不舒服，喘不过来气。
On January 12, suddenly feverish and stuffy, my mother came back from the hospital in Wuchang the next day with a cold. After two or three days, around January 12, she had a fever.
因为武昌医院离我们家比较近，发烧第二天她就住进了武昌医院的心血管科。
Because Wuchang Hospital is close to our home, she was admitted to the cardiology department of Wuchang Hospital the next day with a fever.
当时，心血管科的诊断是疑似发烧引起的心肌炎，还做了心电图，但是病因一直没有找到。
At the time, the cardiology department's diagnosis was suspected fever caused by myocarditis, also did electrocardiogram, but the cause has not been found.
妈妈住院的这几天还没春节放假，我每天下班，就去住院部看她，跟她一起吃饭。
Mother has not been in the hospital these days Spring Festival holiday, I work every day, go to the inpatient department to see her, eat with her.
1月16日，从心血管科转呼吸内科治疗，医生让我祈祷有一天我们最忙的时候，我接到了心血管科的医生的电话，她说我妈情况不太好，要我赶快来，我很紧张，向单位请了假就去了。
On January 16, when I was transferred from cardiology to cardiology, the doctor asked me to pray that one day when we were busiest, I got a call from a cardiologist who said my mother was not doing well.
医生把我叫到她办公室，说我妈妈住院了3、4天，打完了头孢三代、左氧沙星，还有一些消炎类的药物，但是发烧的症状还是没有缓解，得转到呼吸内科去。
The doctor called me to her office and told me that my mother had been hospitalized for three or four days, that she had finished ceftrigeneration, levoxacin and some anti-inflammatory drugs, but that the fever had not abated and that she had to turn to the respiratory department.
最可怕的是我妈妈的肺部，两次CT变化很大。
The scariest thing is my mother's lungs. Two CT scans have changed a lot.
刚住院的时候，妈妈肺部的CT没有什么问题，可能有轻微的炎症。
At the time of admission, there was no CT problem with the mother's lungs, and there might be mild inflammation.
医生那天叫我去的时候，我很清楚地看到我妈的肺有鳞片状，很多片状的白色阴影，在她的肺小叶的末端均匀分布。
When the doctor called me that day, I could see clearly that my mother's lungs were scaly, with many flaky white shadows that were evenly distributed at the end of her lobule.
竟然在用了这么多消炎抗病毒药治疗的情况下，三天之内急剧加重成这个样子。
Even after so much anti-inflammatory antiviral treatment, the situation increased dramatically in three days.
郑阿姨的演出照（右三）我记得呼吸内科的医生跟我说的第一句话是：你妈妈的情况不是很好，你现在做的只有祈祷，祈祷你的妈妈不是（新型冠状病毒）。
Aunt Zheng's performance photo (3rd right) I remember the first words the physician told me: Your mother is not doing very well. All you are doing is praying that your mother is not.
我一听这个话，真的就是眼前一黑。
When I heard this, it was a real black eye.
但我很快就振作起来，就算用尽各种办法，我也要救我妈妈。
But I quickly brushed myself up and tried everything I could to save my mother.
当时呼吸科那层楼已经住不下了，全都是人，过道上也都是人，最后我们是住进了消化内科的那一层的过道加床。
The ventilator floor was no longer occupied, it was filled with people, the aisles were filled with people, and we ended up living in the aisle and bed on the digester floor.
因为不在同一楼层，我每天就在呼吸科和消化科几处奔走，排队买药。
As I was not on the same floor, I was running around the ventilator and digestive department every day, queuing up to buy medicine.
在我妈转到呼吸内科去不久，我爸也开始发热了，他跟我妈妈的状况比较相似，但是一进医院之后状况更糟糕。
Not long after my mother went to the respiratory department, my dad had a fever too. He was in a similar situation to my mother, but it got worse when he arrived at the hospital.
刚开始的前两天，我爸是坐在呼吸内科过道的板凳上面打针，我是楼上楼下跑送饭。
For the first two days, my dad was sitting on a bench in the respiratory department aisle, and I was running upstairs and downstairs delivering food.
过了两天左右他的白细胞已经快降到零了，生命体征特别不好，就直接转到ICU里了。
After two days or so, his leukocytes had almost gone down to zero, his vital signs were particularly bad, and he went straight to the ICU.
刚住院那几天，郑阿姨在心内科病房呼吸科的病人太多了，所有的走道都是满的，没有床位的病人就坐在走廊里打针，我其实特别怕，但是我没有办法，也是那时我才开始戴口罩，有防护意识。
When I was in the hospital for a few days, Aunt Zheng had too many patients in the cardiology department. All the hallways were full and the bed-less patients were sitting in the hallway giving injections.
每一天在医院照顾我妈大概16个小时，早上8点就去了，陪床到12点半才回家。
I took care of my mother in the hospital for about 16 hours every day. I went there at 8 a.m. and stayed in bed until half past twelve.
每天回家以后把衣服全部脱下来，从里到外消毒、洗，然后洗头、洗澡。
After going home every day to take off all the clothes, from the inside out disinfect, wash, and then wash, bathe.
可能洗完又到凌晨一两点，然后第2天早上8点再去医院。
Maybe it'll be done at one or two in the morning and then go to the hospital at 8 a.m. the next morning.
那几天，妈妈的情况一天比一天差，吃不下任何东西。
In those days my mother's condition was getting worse and worse and she could not eat anything.
这个病有一个显著的特征，就是没有胃口。
The disease is marked by a lack of appetite.
她就只喝一点点稀饭，每天都在反复发烧。
She only drank a little porridge and had a fever every day.
下午烧一次，半夜又烧一次，就这样连续烧了快10天。
It burned once in the afternoon and again in the middle of the night for nearly 10 days.
那段时间其实我也很怕，我求助了所有的朋友、闺蜜，让他们帮我想办法。
In fact, I was afraid of that time, I asked all the friends, boudoir, let them help me find a way.
已经治了这么久，人还是烧得糊里糊涂。
After so long treatment, people are still burning muddled.
如果治不好的话，要不要转到三甲医院去？郑阿姨的第二次CT报告医生也知道我的情况，她说你爸爸在ICU，妈妈在病床上，你要坚强。
If it doesn't work, do you want to go to Sanjia Hospital? Aunt Zheng's second CT report doctor also knows my case, she said your father in ICU, mother in the bed, you have to be strong.
每天一看见医生，我的眼泪就不停地掉，护士长跟医生都安慰我说，你不能哭，你哭了，如果让妈妈看见更不得了。
Every day when I saw the doctor, my tears kept falling away. The head nurse and the doctor told me that you could not cry.
所以我每一次都是把眼泪一擦，转头再用笑脸去面对妈妈，鼓励她。
So every time I wipe my tears, turn my head and smile again to face my mother and encourage her.
呼吸内科的一个护士长，她看到我父母这样，觉得我很可怜，就偷偷地往我口袋里面塞口罩，还拿了护士的那种帽子。
A head nurse in the Department of Respiratory Medicine, seeing my parents like this and feeling sorry for me, slipped a mask into my pocket and took the nurse's hat.
她说你要戴帽子，这里太危险了，那些飞沫沾在头发上也很危险。
She said you were going to wear a hat. It was too dangerous here, and it was dangerous to get those droplets in your hair.
还叮嘱我每天回去一定要洗手，跟妈妈接触，陪她上厕所或者是帮她拿了水，一定要洗手，还把护士站专门的消毒液给我用。
I was also told to wash my hands every day, contact my mother, accompany her to the toilet or take water for her, make sure I wash my hands and give me the special disinfectant from the nurses' station.
我就疯狂地洗手，手都要洗烂了。
I wash my hands crazily. My hands are all washed up.
有一天我发现一个很危险的情况，她白天因为发烧整个人不停地颤抖，手脚痉挛，她就说非常冷，畏寒。
One day I found a very dangerous situation, because she had a fever during the day all the people shiver, spasms, she said very cold, afraid of cold.
虽然一直在吸氧，但感觉有一点呼吸困难了。
I've been taking in oxygen, but I feel a little out of breath.
我就把医生叫来，医生给我妈妈上了一种退烧栓，还打了一种肌肉注射的强行退烧的针，但仍旧没有好转迹象。
I called the doctor, who gave my mother an antifebrile and a muscular injection to force the fever down, but there were no signs of improvement.
1月19日，突然便血，我觉得快要失去妈妈了1月19号晚上，妈妈突然便血了。
January 19, suddenly blood, I feel about to lose my mother January 19 night, my mother suddenly blood.
她自己还比较乐观，说可能是发了痔疮。
She herself was optimistic that she might have had haemorrhoids.
护士长给了我一个取样器，说让妈妈下次取一点样送去化验。
The head nurse gave me a sampler and told my mother to take a sample for testing next time.
当我看见取样杯的时候，崩溃了，便很少，全部都是血。
When I saw the sampling cup, it collapsed, it was very small, it was all blood.
在妈妈住院的时候，我自己上网查了非常多案例及别人的帖子，几乎所有人都提到在病情恶化后会出现便血的情况。
When my mother was in hospital, I looked up a lot of cases and other people's posts on the Internet, almost all of them mentioned the case of hematopoiesis after the illness worsened.
那天半夜12点多，我拿着小量杯，送去另外一个楼化验。
I took a small measuring cup and sent it to another building for testing at midnight.
我觉得那天晚上的风特别冷，那段路是我从小到大走得最漫长的一段路。
I felt that the wind was particularly cold that night, and that part of the road was the longest way I had come from childhood to adulthood.
我全身都在发抖，我就觉得我是不是快要失去我妈妈了，我父亲那边还不知道怎么样，自己也有可能被感染……那种看不到希望，觉得一切都要完了的绝望。
I was shaking, and I wondered if I was about to lose my mother, that my father didn't know what to do, and that he might be infected... the despair of seeing hope and feeling that everything was going to die.
呼吸内科满员，郑阿姨在消化内科走廊加床1月20日，转入武昌医院ICU病房，注射免疫球蛋白妈妈便血后的第2天，医院的领导很关心我们家的情况，告诉我不要灰心，还是要鼓起勇气，“过道加床环境也不是很好，也不能好好休息，我们想办法让她到环境稍微好一点的地方治疗。
Department of Respiratory Medicine Full, Aunt Zheng in the digestive medicine corridor plus bed January 20, Wu Chang Hospital ICU Ward, injection of immunoglobulin mother hematopoiesis, the hospital leadership is very concerned about our family situation, told me not to lose heart, or courage, "corridor plus bed environment is not very good, we do not have a good rest, we find ways to her slightly better environment treatment.
”医院建议让妈妈转入ICU病房。
The hospital advised her to transfer to the ICU ward.
武昌医院不是三甲医院，我也考虑过转院的问题，一是因为当时整个武汉市所有的三甲医院全部爆满，很难找到床位；二是我查了资料，新型肺炎目前没有特效药，不如安心在一个医院好好治。
Wuchang Hospital is not the Three-A Hospital, I have also considered the issue of hospital transfer, one is because all the three-A hospitals in Wuhan were full at that time, it is difficult to find beds; the other is I checked the information, the new pneumonia has no specific medicine, it is better to be safe in a hospital.
所以就同意让母亲转去ICU继续治疗。
So she agreed to transfer her mother to ICU for further treatment.
事实证明我的选择没有错，我们遇到的武昌医院每一个科室的医生护士都特别好。
As it turned out, my choice was correct and the doctors and nurses in every department of Wuchang Hospital we met were particularly good.
一月十几号的时候，武汉情况就已经很严重了，但是核酸检测方法还没有大面积运用，确诊的办法就是查已知病毒是否是阴性。
Wuhan was already in serious condition in January, but nucleic acid testing methods have not been widely used, the diagnosis is to check whether the virus is negative.
我爸爸是所有的已知病毒全部阴性，就很快被确诊为新型肺炎，所以直接从武昌医院的ICU，转到了武汉市集中收治的金银潭医院，而我妈妈一直到转入ICU病房才确诊。
My father, who was all negative for all known viruses, was quickly diagnosed as a new type of pneumonia, so I was transferred directly from the ICU in Wuchang Hospital to the gold and silver pool hospital in Wuhan, and my mother was not diagnosed until she was transferred to ICU.
每天给妈妈送的保命药，要放在冰箱冷藏我妈妈一直在ICU，每天打非常多的针，保护器官的药、各种营养针、各种抗病毒抗感染的针，包括免疫球蛋白。
Keep it in the refrigerator Refrigerated.My mother has been working on ICU every day on lots of needles, organ protection medications, various anti-viral injections, including immunoglobulins.
每天从早上8点开始打，一直到凌晨到5点才能打完。
It starts at 8am every day and doesn't finish until 5am.
医生对我说，这个病现在没有特效药，只能用球蛋白或是激素疗法，辅助和增强你的抵抗力，最后战胜病毒还是靠你自己。
The doctors told me that there is no specific cure for the disease, only globulin or hormone therapy, to help and strengthen your resistance, the final victory over the virus or on your own.
从1月16号开始，医生就要我去买人体免疫球蛋白，这个药很贵，我爸跟我妈基本上一天6瓶，一个人光打球蛋白一天就是3、4千块。
From January 16, doctors asked me to buy human immunoglobulin, which is expensive. My father and my mother basically had six bottles a day, and a person playing globulin alone was 3,000 or 4,000 a day.
妈妈进ICU的头两天还是在发烧。
Mom had a fever for the first two days of ICU.
她每天早上给我发消息，说昨晚有一点烧。
She sends me news every morning that she had a slight fever last night.
我就跟她说：没关系，继续保持！继续坚持下去一定会好的！那段时间我睡眠特别浅，不管她6点还是几点给我发第一条消息，我都会听见，然后马上回复她，我就说很好！继续保持加油！纬纬给妈妈加油打气我没有办法去探望她，只能每天给她打鸡血、鼓励她。
I said to her: Never mind, keep it up! It'll be okay to keep it up! I'll sleep very light during that time. No matter when she sends me the first message, I'll hear it, and I'll say it's OK! Keep up the good work!
我说你自己要有信心，不能放弃，能挺着熬过来就熬过来了，这个病对中老年人病程都是比较长，都是20多天，它有一个过程，你现在赛程才过半，后面还有一半的路要走，一定要坚持下去。
I said that you have to have confidence, can not give up, can stand it through, the disease is more than 20 days to the elderly, it has a process, you are only halfway through the race, the remaining half of the road, must adhere to.
我就这样每天不停地给她洗脑，不停地输出，不让她有一丝松懈。
In this way, I continuously brainwash her every day, constantly output, do not let her have the slightest relaxation.
但是我自己忍受着强烈的恐惧，当时真的靠一股意志力把我支撑着。
But I bore my own intense fear, and I was sustained by a will-power.
因为我很怕我自己也被感染，如果我被感染了，谁给我送球蛋白、送保命的药，就没有人照顾我爸妈了，我们这个家就完了，所以我怎么样我也不能被感染。
Because I'm afraid I'll get infected myself, And if I get infected, Who's gonna give me globulin, life-saving drugs, No one's gonna take care of my parents, We're done here, so whatever I do I can't be infected.
1月25日，体温稳定，开始有胃口免疫球蛋白连续打了大概5天以后，妈妈的体温就慢慢稳定下来了。
On January 25, her temperature stabilized and she began to have an appetite for immunoglobulin for about five days before her temperature stabilized.
郑阿姨出院前与医护人员合影因为住院太久了，那个时候妈妈没有看外面的新闻，她不知道这是一件非常恐怖的事，这种盲目的乐观其实帮助了她。
Before leaving hospital, Aunt Zheng took pictures with the medical staff because she had been hospitalized for a long time. At that time, her mother did not read the news outside.
等到她的体温慢慢稳定了。
By the time her temperature had stabilized.
她开始跟我说，她在ICU觉得有点饿了，我听到很高兴，有胃口就代表她已经开始恢复了，变好了。
She started to tell me that she felt a little hungry in the ICU, and I was glad to hear it, and having an appetite meant she was beginning to recover and be better.
我记得1月26号那天我还专门在网上下单，想办法找人给ICU送了一大堆吃的，各种水果、零食。
I remember on January 26th, I also placed a special order online, trying to find someone to give ICU a large number of food, various fruits, snacks.
我跟妈妈说一定要吃饱，不保证营养、不吃饱怎么能恢复呢？当时我还写了一条很长的备注，特别害怕外卖小哥看到医院的单子不敢接。
I told my mother that I must eat full, do not guarantee nutrition, do not eat full how can I recover? I also wrote a long remarks, especially afraid to see the take-out brother at the hospital list do not dare to take.
我那个时候想，如果没有人接，我就是出门骑共享单车，也得送到医院。
I thought that if no one answered, I would go out and share my bike and go to the hospital.
纬纬给骑手的备注后来妈妈越来越稳定之后，就开始做核酸测试。
The weft notes for riders were later tested for nucleic acids after mom became more stable.
必须两次核酸测试结果连续阴性，中间间隔24小时，才能达到出院的标准。
Two successive negative nucleic acid tests with a 24-hour hiatus are required to meet the discharge criteria.
我妈测试的结果就是一次阴，一次阳，可能不是很稳定，她在ICU里就又过了一段时间。
My mom's test turned out to be a yin, a yang, maybe not very stable, and she passed another period in the ICU.
2月1日，两次测试阴性，ICU宣布出院，但没有车愿意接一直到2月1号那天，两次核酸测试都是阴性，ICU才宣布她可以出院。
On February 1, two tests negative, the ICU announced that she was discharged from hospital, but no car would take her until February 1, when both nucleic acid tests were negative.
妈妈出院的那天，武汉已经封城9天了。
Wuhan had closed the city for nine days on the day of her mother's discharge from hospital.
我被社区定为密切接触者，出门受到了很大的限制，问了120、社区用车、志愿者车队也都没有回应。
I was identified by the community as a close contact, travel was very limited, asked 120, the community car, the volunteer convoy also did not respond.
当时我的一个好朋友知道了，她刚好在媒体，主动提出去医院接我妈妈，还帮我记录下了妈妈出院的这一刻。
A good friend of mine found out that she happened to be in the media and offered to go to the hospital to pick up my mother.
出院时接受媒体采访从妈妈进ICU到现在出院这么多天，我一直没有见到她，虽然住的两个小区只有几百米，但是我们都在坚持互相隔离。
I haven't seen my mom for days since she was discharged from the ICU. Although the two communities are only a few hundred meters apart, we are all sticking to each other.
在我妈出院之前，我就联系了社区、物业，联系了洪山疾控中心，对家里进行了专业的消毒，妈妈回来了之后，我就请代跑腿小哥，给家里送了很多蔬菜水果。
Before my mother left the hospital, I contacted the community, property, contact Hongshan CDC, professional disinfection of the family, my mother came back, I asked for running errands, to send a lot of fruits and vegetables to the family.
我妈出院回来以后，她的肺部其实还是有一些损伤，比较容易胸闷气短，毕竟人躺了那么长时间，各方面都有点虚弱。
After my mother came back from hospital, she still had some lung injury, easier chest airiness, after all, people have been lying for so long, all aspects a little weak.
过了一两天，我爸爸也从金银潭出院了。
After a day or two, my father was discharged from the gold and silver pool.
出院之后，我特意嘱咐他们两个人要分房睡，分餐吃，不要出门，还是继续互相隔离，再观察一段时间。
After I left the hospital, I specifically instructed them to sleep separately and share their meals, not to go out, or to remain isolated from each other for another period of time.
医生还开了一些药给他们，现在他们两个在家里正常做饭，自己照顾自己。
The doctor also prescribed some medicine to them, and now the two of them are cooking normally at home, taking care of themselves.
妈妈的手被用作宣传照现在想想，我觉得就是依靠自己强大的意志力。
Mom's hands are used as publicity photos. Now, I think it depends on my strong willpower.
这么长时间自己其实也没有特别的防护，就是吃奥司他韦，一天一颗，密切接触者吃10天，还有一些其他中成药。
There is no special protection from oseltamivir for so long, one per day, close contacts for 10 days, and some other proprietary Chinese medicines.
然后就是跟我的闺蜜们在网上一起打气，我还把我防护的一些小技巧写了一个简短的攻略，怎么吃药，用什么洗手，用什么消毒，然后要吃什么东西，怎么样增强抵抗力，跟她们分享。
And then there was the cheer with my girlfriends online, and I wrote down some tips on how to take medicine, what to wash your hands with, what to disinfect, what to eat, and how to build up your resistance.
我妈住院这十几天，我完全没有顾得上给自己囤物资、做饭，都是周围的朋友，隔空给我家门口投送一些熟食、水果、药物。
My mother was hospitalized for a few days, I completely did not care for their own hoard supplies, cooking, are friends around, the door to send some cooked food, fruit, medicine.
大年三十，我记得是这个送我一点水果，那个送我一点蔬菜，另外一个人送我一点肉，煮了点速冻饺子。
In my late thirties, I remember this one gave me some fruit, another gave me some vegetables, another gave me some meat and cooked some fast-frozen dumplings.
整个过年都是我一个人在家，根本顾不上吃喝，一有空就在查关于这个病的资料。
All through the New Year is I alone at home, no matter how much food and drink, as soon as you have time to check the information about the disease.
中间陪护那几天我已经有一点症状，有一点鼻塞，喉咙也有点疼，我就赶快吃药，心里想说我千万不能被病毒入侵了，我一定要坚持住。
In the middle of those days I have a bit of symptoms, a bit stuffy nose, throat pain, I quickly take medicine, I want to say that I must not be virus invasion, I must insist.
现在我差不多在家自我隔离了14天了，身体状况一切良好，也是一种万幸。
I have been isolated at home for almost 14 days now, in good health and fortunate enough.
我觉得我妈妈能康复的最大原因，除了本来身体素质比较好，还因为她是特别乐观的人，面对任何事情都有一个好的心态，这是我们的幸运。
I think the biggest reason for my mother's recovery is that she is physically fit, but also because she is a very optimistic person and has a good attitude toward everything.
而且有很多医生、护士帮助了我们，我特别感谢他们！妈妈出院之后，我产生了一些应激反应经历了这20天的生死离别，我再回想起来很后怕，最严重的时候，我整晚整晚地做噩梦，有时候会梦见我自己也生病了，可是早上起来之后，我还是坚持跟自己说，没事的，肯定没事的。
And there were doctors and nurses who helped us, and I thank them in particular! After my mother left the hospital, I had some stressful experiences after 20 days of dying and dying, and in retrospect, I had nightmares all night and sometimes dreamt I was sick myself.
后来我找心理医生聊了一下，她说现在的应激反应需要时间和自我调节，才能慢慢恢复。
Then I talked to a psychiatrist and she said that the stress response now takes time and self-regulation to recover.
因为妈妈出院了，好像一下子把我从某种状态里面拉回到现实生活，精神还是特别紧张。
Because my mother was discharged from the hospital, as if to pull me out of a certain state into real life, the spirit is still particularly nervous.
所以我一直没有联络很多人，直到这两天状态好一些，我才想把自己的经历分享给更多的人知道。
So I didn't get in touch with many people until I was in better shape for the last two days, so I wanted to share my experience with more people.
我觉得这个病就像猫跟老鼠，你抵抗力很强，它就入侵不了。
I think this disease is like a cat and mouse, you have a strong resistance, it can not invade.
我们武汉人有一句话，叫“不信邪”，我觉得这就是我们武汉人的精神。
We Wuhan people have a saying, called "do not believe evil," I think this is the spirit of our Wuhan people.
一定要坚定信念，用最强的信念去打败它、战胜它。
Must firmly believe, with the strongest faith to defeat it, overcome it.
