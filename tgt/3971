口述实录·火线我们要想办法拖住重症新冠肺炎病人的生命，让他有机会去“熬病程”，要尽可能减少医源性的损害。
Oral Reported Fire Lines We need to find a way to hold someone with severe coronary pneumonia (ICAP) alive and give him a chance to "stay alive" and minimize the risk of iatrogenic damage.
记者 | 黄　祺在武汉迄今将近50天的时间里，管向东教授的职责被形容为“灭火队长”或者“最强大脑”，他总是出现在那些有难题的病人床前。
For nearly 50 days now in Wuhan, Wang Qian, whose job as professor east has been described as "fire captain" or "strongest brain," has always appeared at the bedside of struggling patients.
管向东教授是著名的重症医学专家、中华医学会重症医学分会主任委员、中山大学附属第一医院重症医学科主任。
Professor Guan Xiangdong is a renowned specialist in severe medicine, director of the Chinese Medical Association's Severe Medicine Division, and director of severe medicine at Zhongshan University's First Affiliated Hospital.
不过，除了上面这些专业上的头衔，最忙时一天要进两三个新冠肺炎ICU病房的管向东，更多的时候就是面对病人、面对生死的医生——他希望挽救每一个生命。
But in addition to these professional titles, the busiest time of day is to enter two or three ICU wards of pneumonia eastward, and more often with a patient-facing, life-and-death doctor who wants to save every life.
管向东教授刚到武汉不久的管向东教授，曾在媒体的电话采访里“哭诉”。
Guan Dong professor just arrived in Wuhan shortly before Professor Tuan Xiangdong, in the media in a telephone interview "cry."
熟悉管教授的人都知道，他平日里乐呵呵、大嗓门，很少有人见他如此伤感。
Anyone familiar with Professor Guan knows that he is usually in a good mood and has a loud voice. Few people see him so sad.
令58岁的管教授难过的是一位病人：“上午去查房的时候他还朝我们敬礼、打招呼，下午去就走了，哎呦……”七尺男儿的泪，为了不治的病人而流。
To the distress of the 58-year-old professor, one of the patients: "He saluted and greeted us in the morning and went away in the afternoon. Ouch..." The tears of the seven-foot-old man flow for the incurable.
最近，湖北疫情趋于好转，春光重现时节，由管向东教授作词、多位援鄂重症医学医护人员演唱的《我希望》制作完成。
Recently, the epidemic situation in Hubei Province tended to improve. During the reappearance of spring light, "I Hope," written by Professor Guan Xiang and sung by many medical professionals in Hubei province, was completed.
“今夜疾风雪舞，长江不见了归帆，我看见生命的脆弱，我幸运，我和他们相伴……我希望把生命继续点燃，让生命在阳光下灿烂……”歌声响起，让人泪目。
"Tonight the wind and snow dance, the Yangtze River disappeared to sail, I saw the fragility of life, I am lucky, I accompany them... I hope to continue to ignite life, life in the sun..." Singing, let people tears.
Play管向东教授作词，20多位一线医护人员演唱的《我希望》3月18日，湖北迎来一张四个“0”的成绩单，武汉新增确诊病例0、武汉新增疑似病例0、湖北新增确诊病例0、湖北新增疑似病例0，此外，全国31个省、自治区、直辖市和新疆生产建设兵团新增本地确诊病例也是0。
Wuhan newly diagnosed cases 0, Hubei new confirmed cases 0, Hubei new suspected cases 0, in addition to the 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps newly confirmed locally.
交上五个“0”成绩单这一天，管向东教授向《新民周刊》回顾了他所经历的、湖北新冠肺炎疫情最艰难的时刻。
On the day he handed in his five "0" report cards, Guan reviewed to Xinmin Weekly the most difficult moment of Hubei's New Crown Pneumonia epidemic.
曾经哽咽，如今歌唱《新民周刊》：国内疫情已经大大缓解，最近您还有什么任务？管向东：我刚刚结束新一轮的巡查回到武汉，这一次去了十堰、宜昌、襄阳和仙桃。
Once choked, now singing "New People's Weekly": the domestic epidemic has been greatly alleviated, what tasks do you have recently? Guan eastward: I have just returned to Wuhan from a new round of inspections, this time to Shiyan, Yichang, Xiangyang and Xiangtao.
湖北现在的疫情可以说已经大为缓解，湖北全省除武汉市以外地区已经连续两周无新增确诊病例。
Hubei now can be said that the epidemic situation has been greatly alleviated, Hubei Province, except Wuhan City has not been confirmed for two weeks in a row.
不过疫情还没有完全结束，就像考试，我们还没有拿到100分。
But the epidemic is not over yet. Like an exam, we haven't got 100.
这些城市医院里还有一些病人，虽然人数已经很少了，但还是有危重型的病人。
There are also patients in these urban hospitals who, although already few in number, are critically ill.
这些危重型的病人，必须要控制住病死率。
These critically ill patients must be kept under control.
目前十堰市只有一例危重型病人，上了ECMO。
Shiyan City at present only one critical type of patient, on ECMO.
襄阳只有两例危重型病人，宜昌也只有两例危重型病人。
There were only two critically ill patients in Xiangyang and only two critically ill patients in Yichang.
这三个武汉周边的大城市，危重型病人加上普通型病人一共大约还有50位左右确诊新冠肺炎病人。
In the three big cities around Wuhan, there are about 50 patients diagnosed with new crown pneumonia who are critically ill plus ordinary patients.
这里我要特别纠正一下，按照新冠肺炎诊疗指南，新冠肺炎病人分为轻型、普通型、重型和危重型这四类，现在很多人，包括医生，把名字都给叫乱了，不够规范。
In particular, I would like to correct that, according to the New Crown Pneumonia guidelines, there are four categories of patients: light, common, severe and critical. Now many people, including doctors, call their names untidy and unstandardized.
重型和危重型病人，主要指的是要依靠医疗措施救治的病人，特别是危重型病人需要生命支持的措施。
Heavy and critical patients, mainly refers to patients who rely on medical interventions, especially critically ill patients in need of life support measures.
《新民周刊》：一些医疗队陆续撤离湖北，您还要留多久？管向东：我是国家卫健委专家组成员，根据目前情况，撤离需要看重型与危重型病例数与救治状况，在最后完成任务之前，至少还有一个月时间，我们专家组应该不会撤。
How much longer do you need to stay eastward as some medical teams are leaving Hubei? Guan Eastward: I am a member of the National Fitness and Health Commission Expert Group. Based on the current situation, evacuation depends on the number and treatment of heavy and critical cases.
管向东教授在病房中指导《新民周刊》：巡查都是要进隔离病房的吗？管向东：巡查当然要进病房啊，昨天一天我进了两次，有时候一天巡查三家医院，就进三次隔离病房。
Guan Dong instructs Xinmin Weekly in the ward: Do inspections go to the isolation ward? Pipe eastward: Of course into the ward. Yesterday I entered twice, sometimes three times a day, and then three times a day.
现在湖北天气热了，里面穿得少，穿上防护服里面也还是湿透了。
The weather in Hubei is very hot now, and the clothes inside is still wet through.
之前天冷就更麻烦，衣服湿了不仅是难受，还特别怕感冒发烧。
Before the cold on the more troublesome, wet clothes are not only uncomfortable, but also afraid of a cold fever.
要是感冒发烧，我可就说不清楚了，要影响工作。
If I have a cold and a fever, I can't say it. I have to work.
《新民周刊》：您到湖北已经将近50天，从最寒冷的季节，到现在春天也到了，疫情也好了。
NEWSWEEK: You've been in Hubei for nearly 50 days. From the coldest season to spring, the outbreak is good.
最近发表的歌曲，是不是表达了您心中的感慨？管向东：写这个纯属有感而发。
Recently published songs, is not the expression of your feelings? Pipe eastward: write this purely sentimental.
我以前从来没有写过歌词，也没有写过诗。
I have never written a lyric before, nor a poem before.
2月14日那天湖北突然降温，很快就暴雪连绵、大风狂刮。
On Feb. 14, Hubei suddenly cooled down and soon blizzled and gale furiously.
那几天武汉新冠肺炎病人死亡的比较多。
In those days, more patients died in Wuhan Xinguan Pneumonia.
我正好在武汉的医疗点巡查，督促医疗点治疗的同质化，就是让大家的医疗行为、救治行为质量统一。
I happen to be in Wuhan medical point inspection, urging the homogenization of medical treatment points, is to let everyone's medical behavior, the quality of treatment unified.
巡查的时候，我偶然看到一个护士小姑娘蹲在楼道里吃饭。
During the inspection, I happened to see a little girl nurse squatting down the aisle for dinner.
那样的天气，医院里死去的病人比较多，医护人员那么艰苦，我的心情不可能好，回到宾馆就写了这些歌词。
That kind of weather, the hospital died more patients, so difficult medical personnel, I could not be in a good mood, back to the hotel wrote these lyrics.
我想描述一下看到的这些人，特别是医护人员，他们也都是很普通的人，有自己私人的想法，但疫情发生后他们都义无反顾地来了。
I would like to describe the people I saw, especially the paramedics, who were also very ordinary people with their own personal ideas, but they came back after the outbreak.
我们都期盼着自己的工作能起成效，能为抗疫做些贡献。
We all hope that our work will be productive and contribute to the fight against the epidemic.
我们也希望疫情早点过去，大家都能够回家。
We also hope that the epidemic will be over and that everyone will be able to go home.
我的两位朋友，看到歌词后很受感动，他们和影视音乐圈都很熟悉，于是紧急联系了著名音乐人解承强作曲，大家决定共同来完成这部第一次由抗疫一线医生们自己演唱的作品，这也是首次用手机演唱录音、远程完成后期制作的作品。
Two of my friends, touched by the lyrics and familiar with the film and television world, have made urgent contact with the famous music legend PvP Chengqiang and decided to work together to complete the first work performed by the first-ever first-line practitioners of the disease. It was also the first time a mobile recording and remote post-production had been made.
《新民周刊》：可能是因为疫情缓解，大家心态都放松了，听这首歌更多的是感觉到希望和力量。
NEWSWEEK: Maybe it's because the epidemic has subsided and people are relaxed. Listening to this song is more about feeling hope and strength.
您之前有一次采访中哽咽，能感受您巨大的压力。
You have had a lump in an interview and can feel your tremendous pressure.
管向东：我是2月2日到武汉的，那几天可以说是最糟糕的阶段。
Pipe to the east: I arrived in Wuhan on February 2, those days can be said to be the worst phase.
可以说武汉当时经历的是“遭遇战”，很多病人住不了院，他在家里，在社区里造成新的传播。
Wuhan can be said to have experienced the "encounter", many patients can not live in the hospital, he was at home, in the community caused a new spread.
所以那段时间院内和院外的死亡比较多。
As a result, there were more deaths in and outside the compound during that period.
我巡查各家医院，天天接触这些情况。
I patrolled hospitals and was in daily contact with them.
还好后来方舱医院和各个医疗点开出来，一下子增加了两三万张病床，病人都得到收治了。
Fortunately, the cabin hospital and the various medical points opened, a sudden increase of two or three thousand beds, patients have been admitted to treatment.
新冠肺炎病人中70%-80%是轻型和普通型病人，但总有一部分患者会走到重型和危重型。
Between 70% and 80% of patients with Newly Coronary Pneumonia are light and common, but there are always some who have severe and critical conditions.
如果到了危重型，死亡率是非常高的，要达到70%。
In the case of critical cases, the mortality rate is very high, at 70 per cent.
我们希望通过努力，尽量控制死亡率，但有的病人不是说你使了劲他就能有效。
We want to try to control mortality as much as we can, but some patients don't say that if you do it he can do it.
那次采访讲的就是当时的那种无奈。
That interview was about that kind of helplessness.
Play广州日报采访视频重症病人救治经验分享给国外同行《新民周刊》：后来重症病人的病死率逐步降低，主要有哪些原因？管向东：到了2月中旬，从救治上来说，有了新的策略。
Play Guangzhou Daily interviewed the foreign counterpart Xinmin Weekly to share the experience of treating patients with severe diseases: What are the main reasons for the gradual decline in the fatality rate of critically ill patients?
“四个集中”的原则就很重要：集中患者、集中专家、集中资源、集中救治。
The principle of "four concentrations" is important: concentrate patients, pool experts, pool resources, and concentrate treatment.
所有的重型、危重型的病人转到10家左右的医院集中救治，不像之前很多医院都有。
All heavy and critical patients were referred to 10 or so hospitals for intensive care, unlike many hospitals before.
重病人迅速归纳和集中到了10家左右条件比较好的、而且有外地医疗队支援的医院中之后，病死率很快就稳定下来了，2月下旬重型病人救治情况就开始趋于好转。
After a rapid induction and centralization of the seriously ill into 10 or so hospitals with better conditions, supported by medical teams in the field, the fatality rate stabilized quickly, and in late February the treatment of heavy patients began to improve.
管向东教授与杜斌、邱海波等专家一起在武汉工作《新民周刊》：救治新冠肺炎重症病人的过程中，专家组不断总结临床经验，这些经验如何指导各个医疗队救治实现同质化？管向东：这次在湖北支援的4万多医护人员里，有将近15000人来自于重症医学的专家、医生、护士，全国的重症医学专家很多都在这里。
Professor Guan Xiangdong worked with experts such as Du Bin and Qiu Haibo in Wuhan. In the course of treating patients with severe cases of Newcomin Pneumonia, the group of experts has been drawing up clinical experience on how to guide medical teams in treating and homogenizing patients.
特别是疫情早期、春节前就来的一群重症医学专家，他们接触病人已经半个月以上，有丰富的临床经验。
Especially in the early stage of the epidemic, the Spring Festival before the arrival of a group of severe medical experts, they have been in contact with patients for more than half a month, with rich clinical experience.
我们这些重症医学专家把临床经验整理出来，形成一个共识。
We, the specialists in severe medicine, put our clinical experience together to form a common understanding.
我会同北京协和医院内科ICU杜斌教授、东南大学附属中大医院重症医学科邱海波教授等国家级专家以及一批在武汉的重症专家们，根据这些共识编写了《新型冠状病毒肺炎重型、危重型病例诊疗方案》，由国家卫健委、中医药管理局下发到湖北和全国各地。
Based on these consensus, I have worked out a new diagnosis and treatment program for severe and serious cases of coronavirus pneumonia, which was distributed to Hubei and other places by the National Health Commission and the Chinese Medicine Administration.
我们的方案非常实用，可以指导医生比较容易地掌握救治的方法和思路。
Our plan is very practical and can guide doctors to grasp the treatment methods and ideas more easily.
国家卫健委《新型冠状病毒肺炎诊疗方案(试行第六版)》开始采纳了我们这个方案里的一部分内容。
The National Fitness and Health Commission's New Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Programme (Trial Version 6) began to incorporate part of our program.
最近，国外同行希望我们能够把这个共识翻译成英文，他们希望跟我们合作，获得中国重症医学医生们的经验。
Recently, our foreign colleagues hope that we can translate this consensus into English, and they hope to cooperate with us to gain the experience of Chinese doctors of severe medicine.
我们已经把英文版交给了对方，毫无保留。
We have given the English version to each other without reservation.
《新民周刊》：作为重症医学专家，您怎么评价这次疫情中中国的重症医学专业力量？管向东：通过疫情我们可以看到，重症医学学科力量需要进一步加强。
NEWSWEEK: As a specialist in severe medicine, how would you describe the severe medical expertise in China in this outbreak? Pipe eastward: Through the outbreak, we can see that the force of severe medicine needs to be further strengthened.
重症医学科从2008年开始成为一个二级学科，但是由于种种原因，我们的住院医师规范化培训里，至今没有重症医学科的住院医师规培，是目前唯一没有纳入住院医生规培体系的二级学科。
Grave medicine has been a secondary subject since 2008, but for a variety of reasons, our standardized training for residents, which has so far no resident discipline in severe medicine, is the only secondary subject not currently included in the resident training system.
入职重症的毕业生（多为硕士博士）只能到其他专科进行住院医师培训，但其他专科的培训内容和重症医学专业的要求还是有差距的，这次疫情中的救治表现充分展示了重症专业人员的专科重要性。
Graduates in the most critical categories (most of whom are master's degrees) are trained as residents in other specialties, but there is still a gap between the contents of training in other specialties and the requirements of the major specialties, and the performance of the treatment in this case fully demonstrates the specialist importance of the intensive care professionals.
因为人才基础薄弱，重症医学整体的学科建设也受到了很大影响。
Because the talent base is weak, the subject construction of severe medicine as a whole has been greatly affected.
另一个问题是，在一些医院里，医院把ICU当做某个科室下的一个附属的科室，这也会限制这个医院重症学科的发展。
Another problem is that in some hospitals, the hospital treats ICU as a subordinate unit under a certain section, which also limits the development of the hospital's intensive care unit.
这次疫情中，我们也发现，各家医院重症医学专业能力参差不齐。
In this outbreak, we also found that the severe medical professional capacity of the hospitals is uneven.
有的医院不一定是高级别的医院，但救治能力表现很好。
Some hospitals are not necessarily high-level hospitals, but the treatment capacity is very good.
武汉周边城市病死率是怎么降下来的《新民周刊》：您有一个很重要的任务是巡查武汉周边城市的救治情况。
Wuhan peripheral cities how to reduce the fatality rate "Xinmin Weekly": You have a very important task is to patrol the treatment of Wuhan peripheral cities.
2月8日前天门市病死率是全省最高的，后来迅速下降。
Before Feb. 8, Tianmen had the highest fatality rate in the province, and then declined rapidly.
2月8日正是您去巡视的这一天，这中间到底发生了什么？管向东：2月8日之后天门市病死率下降这个是真的，但并不能说都是我的功劳。
What happened between February 8 and the day you went on a tour? Pipe eastward: It's true that the death rate in Tianmen fell after Feb. 8, but it's not all my fault.
2月8日是元宵节，那天我接到指挥部的任务，需要去天门市了解当地情况。
On Feb. 8, the Lantern Festival, I was asked by the headquarters to go to Tianmen City to find out the local situation.
人们非常关心，天门市的病死率为什么第一？而且死亡的病人里面还有30多岁的年轻人。
People are very concerned about why Tianmen City has the highest fatality rate, and there are people in their thirties among the dead.
去之前我怀疑是不是没有及时插管有创通气，去了一看，果然是没有及时做插管通气。
Before going, I wondered if I had not intubated in time to have invasive ventilation, went to see, is really not timely to do intubation.
原因是多方面的，有救治方法不确定的原因，也有防护物资不到位大家恐惧的原因，我们不可能让医护人员冒着生命危险去做。
The reasons are many, there are uncertain treatment methods, there are also protective materials do not place the reasons why we fear, we can not let the health-care personnel risk their lives to do.
我去的时候，他们的ICU已经开始收治病人，并开始了插管有创通气。
By the time I got there, their ICU had begun to treat patients and to begin invasive intubation.
到天门市的医院后，我主要强调了插管的重要性，把整个治疗思路给他们。
After arriving at the hospital in Tianmen City, I mainly emphasized the importance of intubation and gave them the whole idea of treatment.
治疗思路很重要，一旦明确治疗思路以后，大家都知道该做什么了。
The treatment thought is very important, once clear treatment idea, everybody knows what should do.
新冠病毒至今没有特效药，不像细菌感染通常是有药的，比如说金黄色葡萄球菌感染，用上抗生素，三天杀死细菌病就好了。
The new crown virus has no specific drug, unlike bacterial infections, such as Staphylococcus aureus infection, antibiotics, three days to kill bacterial disease.
但新冠肺炎的治疗，不要以为病人是我们治好的，对付这个病毒，我们医护人员能做的就是帮助病人去“熬病程”，让体内的抗体出来消灭病毒，恢复正常的身体状态。
But the new crown pneumonia treatment, do not think we cured the patient, to deal with the virus, we health care workers can help patients to "boil the course," let the body's antibodies out of the virus, restore normal physical state.
所以我们要想办法拖住重症新冠肺炎病人的生命，让他有机会去“熬病程”，要尽可能减少医源性的损害，是这样的一个过程。
So we need to find a way to delay the life of patients with severe coronary pneumonia, to give him the opportunity to "boil the course", to minimize the iatrogenic damage, is such a process.
这就是我们说的救治思路。
This is what we mean by cure.
在这个过程中间，该插管通气的就要插管，该增加免疫力的增加免疫，该少用免疫抑制剂的就少用一些或不用。
In the middle of this process, the intubation of the intubation is about to be intubated, which increases immunity by increasing immunity, and those who use less immunosuppressive agents use less or less.
我去之前他们的ICU病区开始收那些危重型和重型的病人，再加上我去做了一些指导，那天之后半个月真的只有一个病人死亡。
Before I went, their ICU unit began to take in patients who were critically ill and heavy-duty, and with some guidance, only one patient died in the second half of the day.
这不能说全是我的原因，只能说大家对治疗思路的认识改变后，救治方法有了变化。
This can not be said to be all my reasons, can only say that the treatment of the change in the mentality of the treatment after the change in the treatment methods.
《新民周刊》：疫情早期我们一度预测武汉周边城市疫情将比武汉更严重，但最后的结果是周边城市更早控制住疫情，这是什么原因？管向东：昨天这一轮巡查我也在观察，发现武汉周边城市，比如十堰市，它的医疗水平可能平时就处在一个比较好的水平，他们医护团队素质挺好的。
2007-9-24 16: 23 (New People's Weekend) At the beginning of the epidemic we predicted that the epidemic would be more serious in the vicinity of Wuhan than in Wuhan, but the end result was that the neighboring cities would bring the epidemic under control even earlier.
还有就是疫情中的城市管理应该说也比较好，我们到每一个城市巡查，市领导都非常重视，要听我们专家组的建议，听我们讲解医疗过程，怎么样采取措施，他们很认真。
And then there is the good urban management of the epidemic. We go to every city, the city leaders take it very seriously, they listen to the advice of our group of experts, we explain the medical process, how to take measures, they are very serious.
上一轮巡视吓我一大跳，荆州、荆门、孝感，有的城市已经十多天新收治确诊病人为零了。
The last round of inspection scared me, Jingzhou, Jingmen, filial piety, some cities have been more than 10 days new treatment confirmed patients are zero.
这个数据意味着这些城市后面做的工作就是消化医院内的病人，那就快了。
That means the jobs behind these cities are digesting patients in hospitals, and that's fast.
可以看到，采取强有力的联防联控措施后，疫情控制有了明显的成效，这说明我们的措施是非常正确的，每一步都没有走错。
As can be seen, with the adoption of strong joint control measures, there have been clear results in the control of the epidemic, which shows that our measures are very correct and that every step has been taken correctly.
传染病是一场看不见硝烟的战争，相信我们的国家在经过这一次疫情后会更加强大。
Infectious disease is an invisible war, and we believe our country will be stronger after this epidemic.
