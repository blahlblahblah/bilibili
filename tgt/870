特约撰稿 潘心洁 本报记者 张玉 镇江扬中 上海报道年初三一大早，一排银灰色厚实的铁栏杆挡住了潘欣（化名）小区的北门，物业工作人员戴着口罩站在栅栏边，口中喊着“不让过，走南门”，南门物业手中的小本子一直不放下，他要登记所有来访人员。
A row of thick silver-gray iron railings blocked the north gate of the Pansin quarter in the early morning of the new year. Property workers stood by the fence in masks, shouting "No way, go south."
几乎是一夜之间，位于江苏省镇江市的江中小岛扬中，入岛的主要交通道路都被管控，岛内也各处拦断。
Almost overnight, on the small island of Yangzhong in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province, the main traffic routes into the island were controlled and the island was cut off.
作为江中小岛，扬中与外面的连接除了渡轮就是几座桥，这几年来渡轮慢慢被空置了，几座主要桥梁成了人们与外界联系的主要通道。
As a small island in the river, Yangzhong is connected to the outside world by several bridges. In recent years, the ferry has been emptied.
而随着疫情的不断扩散，“一桥禁止通行”，“幸福大桥关闭”，“泰州大桥排起了大长龙”，小岛独立于长江之上。
And with the spread of the epidemic, "a bridge closed", "happiness bridge closed," "Tai Zhou Bridge lined up long lines," the island is independent of the Yangtze River.
不过，疫情形成的地理距离并为阻隔人们之间心的沟通。
However, the geographical distance created by the outbreak and the heart-to-heart communication between people are blocked.
入岛路径皆被管控1月24日24时，江苏省启动突发公共卫生事件一级响应。
Access to the island is regulated January 24 at 2400 hours, Jiangsu Province launched a public health emergency first-level response.
26日，扬中所在的镇江市确诊2例感染，1例在丹阳，1例在新区。
26, Yangzhong in Zhenjiang City confirmed 2 cases of infection, 1 case in Danyang, 1 case in the new district.
镇江市疫情防控指挥部随即发布一级响应措施的通告，一方面要求社区实施地毯式管理，做好疫情信息搜集和后续处理；另一方面，在车站、港口、渡口、国省道、高速公路口等出入镇江通道，都设置了卫生检疫站点和临时观察室，实施强制卫生检疫措施，要求所有湖北地区来镇人员主动进行健康申报和体温检测。
The Zhenjiang Disease Control and Prevention Command immediately issued a notice on the first-level response measures, on the one hand, community implementation of blanket management, good information collection and follow-up on the epidemic; on the other hand, stations and temporary observation rooms have been set up at stations, ports, ferries, national provincial roads and highway crossings to enforce compulsory sanitary and quarantine measures.
与此同时，26日扬中防疫部门宣布，自当日24时起扬中一桥、幸福大桥进行临时关闭，此外，扬中三桥、泰州大桥、幸福二桥、扬高汽渡等卡口也有人24小时值守，对进入扬中车辆和人员进行严格的体温检测。
At the same time, the Yangzhong-Zhongshan epidemic prevention department announced the temporary closure of Yangzhong-yi Bridge and Happiness Bridge from 2400 hours on the same day. In addition, the Yangzhong Sanqiao, Taizhou Bridge, Happy Erqiao and Yanggao steam ferry are also manned 24 hours a day.
至此，扬中主要入岛路径皆被管控。
So far, Yangzhong main access to the island are managed.
（连夜设置卡口/由受访者提供）（主要通道关闭提示/由受访者提供）（检测卡口/由受访者提供）此外，据可靠消息，在无锡确诊的1例男子为扬中油坊镇人士，去无锡之前曾在家中停留数日，为防患于未然，家中父母也已被隔离观察。
In addition, according to reliable sources, a man diagnosed in Wuxi was a resident of Yangzhong Oilfield, who had stayed at home for a few days before going to Wuxi. As a precaution, the parents of the family were also quarantined.
大年初一，因居委会提前就每家每户上门派发了倡议书，整个小区几乎没有人员走动。
New Year's Day, because the neighborhood committee on each house in advance of the distribution of a proposal, the entire community almost no people walking.
以往逢至年关，回乡的人多了，住在敬老院中的老人们都被孩子接回了家，跟亲戚朋友们扯闲话、唠家常。
Since the New Year's Day, many people have returned home, and the elderly people living in homes for the aged have all been taken home by their children, gossiping with relatives and friends.
今年，直至初三小区中也鲜有见到出门走动的老人。
This year, until the third quarter of the community also rarely see the elderly walking outside.
通过儿女们的帮助，老人们互相通过视频问候。
With the help of their children, older people greet each other via video.
（超市中面类商品被抢购一空）（人烟稀少的菜市场）心的交流无法阻隔疫情无情人有情。
A heart-to-heart exchange cannot stop an outbreak of senseless carriages of affection.
1月26日下午，扬中全市正在休假的医护人员和政府工作人员接到通知开始正常上岗工作。
On the afternoon of January 26, medical staff and government workers on leave in Yangzhong city were informed to start their normal duties.
家住西来桥镇的扬中市人民医院护士冯玉（化名）也不例外。
Fengyu (alias), a nurse at Yangzhong People's Hospital who lives in Xialaiqiao town, is no exception.
（小区关闭北侧大门）过完初一，冯玉就立刻奔赴所在医院，回到了岗位。
After the first day of junior high school, Feng Yu rushed to his hospital and returned to his post.
原本初二下午有半天假期可以回西来桥岛，但听闻二桥即将封闭，她放弃了回家的计划。
Originally two afternoon half-day holiday can return to the west bridge island, but heard that the bridge is about to close, she gave up the plan to go home.
“如果回去了，下午就上不来了（到医院），肯定不能回，特殊时期啊。
"If you go back, you won't be able to get to the hospital in the afternoon.
”据悉，扬中市人民医院腾空了整座8号楼作为发热门诊和隔离观察病区的独立用房。
The Yangzhong People's Hospital has vacated the entire building as an independent home for the fever clinic and quarantined observation area, it said.
1月26日晚间，迁移病房的工作完成——80名医务人员仅用了1小时，就将5个病区45名患者平安转移至新的病区。
On the night of January 26, the relocation of the ward was completed - it took only one hour for 80 medical staff to safely move 45 patients from five affected districts to new areas.
（扬中市人民医院医生主动报名/由受访者提供）在此之前，扬中市人民医院的口罩供应商来自扬州，1月22日扬州出现确诊案例后停止了口罩的供应，再加上现在全国物资都以支援武汉为先，冯玉目前所在医院的口罩每天都在限量供应。
Before that, the supplier of face masks at Yangzhou People's Hospital came from Yangzhou, stopped the supply of face masks after the case was diagnosed in Yangzhou on January 22.
对于冯玉来说，这还不仅是一个为了疫情加班的新年。
For Feng Yu, it was more than just a New Year's holiday for the epidemic.
正月十三本是她和男友要订婚的日子，蒸了糕点、装饰了屋子、买好了金银首饰，也因为这突如其来的疫情搁置下来了。
January 13 was the day of her engagement to her boyfriend, steamed pastries, decorated the house, bought gold and silver jewelry, and put the outbreak on hold.
“也没什么，感情确定最重要，日子就往后延延吧。
"It's nothing. It's the emotion that counts. Let's put it off.
”在扬中岛，大多数人的新年计划都由于突如其来的疫情暂停了。
On Yangzhong Island, most people's New Year's resolutions were suspended because of a sudden outbreak.
相关部门在第一时间对主要交通道路进行关闭和严查后，各地镇、村、小区也都对流动人员进行了严格登记。
Relevant departments in the first time to the main traffic road closed and strict investigation, towns, villages, small areas have also carried out strict registration of mobile personnel.
不仅明令禁止饭店聚餐宴席，农村地区还使用大喇叭来回播放不要串门的建议，对于偶有的外出人员，工作人员都手持记录簿登记在册。
Not only is a restaurant banquet forbidden, but loudspeakers are used in rural areas to play back and forth without visiting the door. For occasional expats, staff members are registered with a logbook.
即便如此，过年该有的温情和人与人之间的联系却没有因此被阻隔。
Even so, the tenderness that should be present during the Chinese New Year and the connections between people have not been cut off.
潘欣家中年近70岁的奶奶意识到这次病毒的易感染情况，在姑姑打电话回家之前就让她跟家里亲戚一个个打了招呼，“过年嘛，心里牵挂着是一样的”。
Her grandmother, nearly 70, recognized the vulnerability of the virus and asked her to greet relatives before she called home. "The New Year is the same," she said.
地理的阻隔没有隔离人们心的交流。
The barrier of geography does not separate human hearts from communication.
在这场战役中，有人星夜奔“战场”，有人无怨无悔地坚守岗位，更多的人们为防控疫情断然停止了自己的计划。
In this battle, some people rushed to the "battlefield", some people without regret to stay at their posts, more people to control the epidemic resolutely stopped their plans.
共克时艰，是今年的年味。
It's the taste of the year.
