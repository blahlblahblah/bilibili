实质上，受疫情冲击影响，整个旅游业损失惨重。
In essence, the impact of the epidemic has taken a heavy toll on the entire tourism industry.
北京第二外国语学院旅游管理学院院长厉新建表示，2020年春节期间中国整个旅游业的直接损失预计在5500亿元左右。

Wei Xiaoan, chief expert of the World Tourism Organization, reckons that with a total tourism revenue of 6.5 trillion yuan in 2019, tourism will lose 17.8 billion yuan after stagnating on average for one day.
百程曾在2016年4月挂牌新三板，成为O2O出境旅游第一股。
In April 2016, PepsiCo was listed in the new three boards, O2O Outbound Travel Unit 1.
作为有着风向标意义的企业、作为第一家在疫情后宣布关闭的旅游公司，百程旅行网会成为被推倒的第一张“多米诺骨牌”吗？冰冻之下，旅游业的出路到底在何方？破产的签证巨头公开资料显示，百程旅游网成立于2000年，以旅游签证业务起家，后拓展旅游目的地业务，于2008年3月获得富达亚洲、银瑞达千万美元A轮投资，于2014年3月完成由阿里牵头的近2000万美元B轮融资。
As a weathervane company, the first travel company to declare its closure after the outbreak, will EMN become the first domino to be pulled down.Under the ice, the bankrupt visa giant revealed that EMTN was founded in 2000 to start with a tourist visa business and expand its tourist destination business.

In 2018, the company posted a mid-year loss of $12,856,400, a year-on-year decline of $5,527,300.

The company reported that the loss is mainly due to the company is still in the Internet industry business expansion period, technology research and development investment in a relatively high level, while market competition and labor cost changes factors of business profits crowding out.
今年2月28日，百程旅行网发布的内部文件显示，公司决定启动清算准备，因受新冠疫情影响，资金不能维持公司继续运转。
On February 28th, internal documents released by the company showed that the company had decided to start liquidation preparations and could not sustain the company because of the new crown outbreak.

在业内人士看来，疫情只是压倒百程的最后一根稻草。
For industry insiders, the epidemic is only the last straw to overwhelm the company.
过去，大众出入境政策的严苛与申请的繁杂，传统签证服务商可以利用信息差等方式获得不错的利润。
In the past, the rigours of mass entry and exit policies and the complexity of applications have allowed traditional visa service providers to make good profits by, for example, exploiting information gaps.
随着越来越多人熟悉了签证流程，尤其是不少使领馆减免了申请材料，放宽了申请条件，无疑压缩了这种以签证为切口和获客手段的生存空间。
As more and more people become familiar with the visa process, in particular a number of embassies and consulates reduced the application materials and relaxed the application conditions, there is no doubt that this visa-cut and access to the means of survival space.
艾媒咨询创始人兼CEO张毅向中国新闻周刊表示，百程旅行网的危机不能单单归结于疫情，身处高速增长的旅游业，却一直处于亏损状态，这表明还是企业在经营管理、商业模式上出现了问题。

”北京德和衡律师事务所主任刘克江向中国新闻周刊表示，不管是解散还是破产，都需依法成立清算组，清理公司财产和债权债务，办理通知、公告债权人，处理公司清偿债务后的剩余财产等事项。
Liu Kejiang, director of Beijing-based De Heng Law Firm, told China News Weekly that in case of dissolution or bankruptcy, a liquidation group should be set up according to law to liquidate the company's property and liabilities, handle notifications, announce creditors and dispose of the company's surplus property after paying off its debts.
从定义上来讲，企业清算是指企业按章程规定解散以及由于破产或其他原因宣布终止经营后，对企业的财产、债权、债务进行全面清查，并进行收取债权，清偿债务和分配剩余财产的经济活动。
By definition, liquidation of an enterprise means that, after dissolution in accordance with the provisions of its articles of association and the declaration of termination of its business due to bankruptcy or other reasons, a comprehensive inventory is made of the property, creditors' rights and liabilities of the enterprise, and economic activities are conducted to collect creditor's rights, repay debts and distribute surplus property.
对于百程旅行网的破产清算，品橙旅游创始人兼CEO王琢向中国新闻周刊表示，这是思路特别清晰、懂公司运营的理性人的一次处理方式。
'This is a way of dealing with rational people with very clear ideas and understanding of how the company operates, 'said Wang Zao, founder and CEO of Zheng Zhiwei Travel, a travel company for 100-way travel.
通过本次疫情能充分认识到，清算与注册一样，是理性、法制、负责任的商业选择。
Through this epidemic we can fully understand that liquidation, like registration, is a rational, legal and responsible business choice.
那么，作为有着风向标意义的旅游企业、作为第一家在疫情后宣布关闭的旅游公司，百程旅行网会成为被推倒的第一张“多米诺骨牌”吗？业内人士告诉中国新闻周刊，由于旅游业不属于重资产行业，其破产不会引起大的连锁反应，但在一定程度上会加快行业的整合速度，相比一些不清算不破产也不运营的僵尸企业，依法清算有序退场不失为一种负责任的举措。
So, as a weathervane tour operator, the first travel company to declare a shutdown after the outbreak, would BLN be the first domino to be pulled down? Industry insiders told China News Weekly that since tourism was not a heavy asset industry, its failure would not cause a major chain reaction, but would accelerate the industry's consolidation somewhat.
“肯定会有一批中小平台面临经营危机，这是正常的优胜劣汰。
"There will definitely be a bunch of small and medium-sized platforms facing an operational crisis.
”张毅表示，疫情结束后旅游业会迎来爆发性增长，对企业来说会是一个很好的机会。
Zhang said the explosive growth in tourism after the epidemic was over would be a good opportunity for companies.
