3月22日早六点，国际市场开盘即现“暴动”。
March 22 early 6: 00, the opening of the international market is "riots."
美股指期货跌超5%，触及下跌熔断限制，道指期货低开近千点。

短期恐慌情绪与结构性失衡相叠加，没有人知道美股何时企稳，以及这会否是全球大萧条的第一声警哨封面设计/黎立文 |《财经》特派记者 金焱 发自华盛顿编辑 | 苏琦十年轮回。
The combination of short-term panic and structural imbalances means that no one knows when US stocks will stabilize, and whether it will be the first warning sign of the global depression. & # 160; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
2009年3月。
March 2009.
美国加州两个儿童出现流感症状，美国疾控中心CDC开始追踪两个案例的感染源，发现均未有家畜接触史，怀疑这种病毒已经在人与人之间传播，这就是2009年被世卫组织定义为全球性大流行病的H1N1流感，三个月左右的时间导致全球近2万人死亡。
The CDC began tracking the source of infection in two cases, and found no history of animal contact. Suspected of human-to-human transmission, the H1N1 strain, defined by WHO as a global pandemic in 2009, killed nearly 20,000 people worldwide in about three months.
十一年后，2020年3月，美国加州因新冠肺炎疫情而全州进入紧急状态，3月4日上午加州出现了首个死亡病例。
Eleven years later, in March 2020, California went into a state of emergency because of the outbreak of pneumonia, and on the morning of March 4, California had its first case of death.
截至3月20日下午，美国30个州和华盛顿特区宣布进入紧急状态，美国49个州和华盛顿特区共有18563例确诊病例，累计死亡病例227例。
By the afternoon of March 20, 30 states and Washington, D.C., had declared a state of emergency, with a total of 18,563 confirmed cases and 227 cumulative deaths in 49 states and Washington, D.C.
在美国首次确诊H1N1流感病例之前不久，美国道琼斯工业平均指数在2009年3月9日触及6440点，创下21世纪以来该指数的最低点位。
The first case of H1N1 in the United States came shortly after the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit 6,440 points on March 9, 2009, its lowest level since the 21st century.
之后美股从最低谷起步，历经欧洲主权债务危机、英国脱欧谈判和中美贸易战等黑天鹅事件，一路攀升。
Since then, US stocks have started at rock bottom, climbing through events such as the European sovereign-debt crisis, the Brexit negotiations, and the Sino-US trade war.
从2009年3月9日到2020年2月市场的最高点，代表美股风向标的道琼斯工业指数、标普500指数和纳斯达克指数分别上涨了359.13％、408.93％和677.36％。
From March 9, 2009 to its peak in February 2020, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq index rose 359.13%, 408.93% and 677.36%, respectively.
其中道琼斯工业指数从6440.08点上涨到29568.57点，标普500指数从666.79点上涨到3393.52点，纳斯达克指数从1265.62点上涨到9838.37点。
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose to 29568.57 from 644.08, the S & P 500 rose to 3393.52 from 666.79, and the Nasdaq climbed to 9838.37 from 1265.62.
过去近11年的时间，上述三大股指的年化增长率分别达到了14.94％、16％和20.57％。
Over the past 11 years or so, the annualized growth rates of the three major indexes have reached 14.94 per cent, 16 per cent and 20.57 per cent respectively.
换句话说，若投资者在2009年市场底部时购买了上述三个指数的ETF基金，其年化收益率为15％-20％，这无论是横向与其他国家股市对比，还是纵向与美国历史上的其他时期对比，这样的收益率都拨得头筹。
In other words, if investors bought ETF funds for the three indices at the bottom of the market in 2009, the annualized return on these three ETFs was 15-20%, either horizontally versus other stock markets or vertically compared to other periods in US history.
2019年中，人们回望2009年的底部——市场从高位跌幅超过50％的拦腰折断时，兴奋地说，十年后的美国股市到了一个“高不可攀”的位置。
In mid-2019, looking back at the bottom of 2009, when markets broke off more than 50% from their highs, it was exciting to say that, a decade later, the US stock market was in an "unreachable" position.
股指创下历史新高，十年涨幅达到322％。
The index hit an all-time high of 322 per cent.
2019年底，人们回顾美国股市当年的业绩时总结说：美股飙升、屡创历史新高。
At the end of 2019, a review of U.S. stock market results concluded that U.S. stocks had soared to record highs.
截至2019年11月30日，标普500指数上涨了28％，市盈率接近18倍，比其15年平均水平高出约24％。
As of November 30, 2019, the S & P 500 was up 28%, near the 18-fold price / earnings ratio, about 24% above its 15-year average.
虽然市场上从来没有一种声音，但进入2020年后，美国三大股指继续屡创新高，分析师之间彼此辩论的内容最多是：市场到底是被高估了？还是被极端高估了？这个辩论一直持续到2020年2月之前。
Although there has never been a single voice in the market, the top three US stock indexes have continued to hit new highs since 2020, with analysts debating, at best, whether the market is overvalued or grossly overestimated - a debate that will continue until February 2020.
全球市场在1月份的短暂冲高之后，开始分化。
After a brief rally in January, global markets began to diverge.
先是美股一路狂奔向上的路上在1月27日遇到第一个小坎——美股三大指数大幅收跌。
First, the U. S. stock all the way up the road in January 27 encountered the first small bar - the U. S. stock index fell sharply.
道指跌逾450点，跌幅为1.57％，纳指跌1.89％，标普500指数跌1.57％，其中道指遭受了自2019年10月以来的最大单日跌幅。
The Dow fell more than 450 points, or 1.57%, to 1.89%, while the S & P 500 was down 1.57%, with the Dow suffering its biggest one-day drop since October 2019.
但它并没有影响美股在2月中旬创出新高。
But it did not affect US stocks' record high in mid-February.
2月中旬后，全球股市在疫情扩散和油价大跌的影响下出现暴跌，多次触发熔断，同时引发跨资产的大幅波动。
After mid-February, global stock markets collapsed under the impact of the spread of the epidemic and the collapse in oil prices, triggering multiple meltdowns and triggering large swings across asset lines.
以2020年1月1日为起点到3月12日收盘，欧美股市跌幅普遍超过20％，进入技术分析意义上的技术性熊市。
From January 1 to March 12, Europe and the US fell more than 20 per cent, entering a technical bear market in the technical sense of the word.
金融市场大起大落，新冠肺炎疫情快速蔓延。
Financial markets have been volatile and the outbreak of new crown pneumonia is spreading rapidly.
世界卫生组织3月18日说，全球新冠肺炎确诊病例累计已超过20万例。
More than 200,000 cases of pneumonia have been confirmed worldwide, the World Health Organization (WHO) said Wednesday.
该组织收到各个国家和地区报告的新冠肺炎确诊病例总数已超过20万例，死亡病例总数超过8000例。
The organization has received reports from countries and territories of more than 200,000 confirmed cases of pneumonia and more than 8,000 deaths.
确诊病例中80％来自西太平洋地区和欧洲地区。
Eighty per cent of confirmed cases came from the Western Pacific and European regions.
2020年春天的华尔街遭遇的是否是一场危机？现在回答这个问题还太仓促，但是华尔街短暂急促的失重，在一个月的时间内从2月19日的高点摔入熊市，暴露了疫情这个前所未有的挑战。
It is too soon to answer the question of whether Wall Street suffered a crisis in the spring of 2020, but Wall Street's brief and precipitous weightlessness, which plunged it into a bear market in a month from its February 19 high, exposed the unprecedented challenge of the epidemic.
瘟疫大流行的历史提供的前车之鉴是：股市崩溃和经济危机相伴相随。
The history of the pandemic has taught us that stock market collapses and economic crises go hand in hand.
此次疫情的公共危机引起金融市场波动加剧，除欧元和日元外的几乎所有货币兑美元比值的大幅下滑。
The public crisis of the epidemic caused increased volatility in financial markets, with almost all currencies, with the exception of the euro and the yen, falling sharply against the United States dollar.
一切仅仅是开始，更大的危机还在酝酿之中。
It's only the beginning. A bigger crisis is brewing.
公共卫生危机正在拖累中国、美国等主要经济体，经济衰退短期不可避免。
A public-health crisis is dragging down major economies like China and the US, and a recession is inevitable in the short term.
如今很多的未知都始自疫情持续的时间，在某种程度上，人类的命运在病毒手里。
Much of today's unknowns date from the time of the outbreak, and to some extent, the fate of humanity lies in the hands of the virus.
做空者的敏锐与煎熬2020年 3月17日，交易员在美国纽约证券交易所工作。

在2008年次贷危机中，市场狂欢时他们的做空不断亏损，面临老板咒骂，客户撤资，同僚讥笑，自我怀疑。
During the 2008 sub-prime crisis, when the market was raging, they were losing money, facing curses from their bosses, divestment from customers, and ridicule and self-doubt from their peers.
做空者苦等崩盘甚至长达两年之久，承受巨大压力。
Short-sellers have been waiting for the crash for as long as two years, under enormous pressure.
新加坡对冲基金QQQ（QQQ Capital Fund）资本创始合伙人王洲对《财经》记者回顾自己做空的心路历程，庆幸它只有一个月左右的时间。
Wang Zhou, a founding partner of QQQ Capital Fund, a Singapore hedge fund, told Caijing that it was lucky it had only a month or so before going short.
2019年12月的圣诞节到2020年3月初，身为国际运输枢纽、作为开放经济体同世界各地紧密相联的新加坡和香港两地，都报出了奇怪肺炎的疑似病例，这引起了QQQ团队的关注——他们对非典记忆犹新，也深知非典疫情对经济的打击——他们评估，疫情可能是2020年的第一只黑天鹅。
From Christmas in December 2019 to early March 2020, Singapore and Hong Kong, both international transport hubs with open economies close to the rest of the world, have reported suspicious cases of strange pneumonia, drawing the attention of the QQQ team, which remembers SARS and knows full well the economic impact of the SARS epidemic, which they assess could be the first black swan in 2020.
他们开始调整仓位，在1月初做多和疫情不相关、可能会在疫情中受益的股票，布局在线教育和线上平台等。
They began to reposition themselves to do more stocks in early January that were unrelated to the epidemic and could benefit from the epidemic, laying out online education and online platforms.
而那时的美股投资者们都还在狂欢的氛围中，市场则表现强劲，从投资者、对冲基金到媒体，极少有对疫情的关注。
Back then, U.S. stock investors were in a rave mood, and markets were strong, with little attention paid to the epidemic, from investors to hedge funds to the media.
王洲记得美股直线拉升，持续创出历史新高。
Wang recalled the sharp rise in U. S. stocks, continued to record highs.
美股在2020年的首个交易日就开门红，标普500指数收盘上涨0.84％，再度刷新历史新高。
U.S. stocks were popular on their first trading day in 2020, when the S & P 500 closed up 0.84%, a fresh all-time high.
成分股中约六成收涨，四成收跌。
About 60% of the shares closed up, 40% closed down.
年初那段时间，随着中美签署第一阶段经贸协议，在最初两周多的时间内，美国三大股指迭创历史新高，QQQ因为做空而流血。
Earlier this year, with China and the US signing of the first phase of the trade agreement, the three major US stock indexes reached an all-time high in the first two weeks, with QQQ bleeding from shorting.
美国股市延续了经典的“圣诞涨势”。
The US stock market continues the classic "Christmas rally."
2019年四季度标普500指数累计上涨8.8％，创下一季度以来最强劲的单季表现，当时该指数上涨了13％。
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 8.8% in the fourth quarter of 2019, its strongest quarterly gain since the index rose 13%.
美国市场相信眼前一曙光：国际紧张形势可能得到缓和；美联储不太可能会在2020年加息；美国消费者支出保持强劲，2020年美国经济陷入衰退的可能性很小。
The US market believes that there is a silver lining: international tensions may ease; the Fed is unlikely to raise interest rates in 2020; US consumer spending remains strong, and there is little likelihood that the US economy will slide into recession in 2020.
王洲不确定自己是否犯了代价昂贵的错误，还是需要有更多的耐心。
Wang Zhou is not sure if he made a costly mistake, or needs to be more patient.
春节，他回到海南过新年，微信和中文媒体上传递着恐慌的情绪，而曾经人们摩肩接踵的街道变得空空如也，忙忙碌碌的商场空空荡荡，大量关张的饭店让他更为确信自己的判断，并把坚决做空的信息发给团队——到中国需要5小时航班的新加坡，那时并未被疫情惊动，和中国跨洋的美国，也只对疫情耸耸肩。
During the Spring Festival, he returned to Hainan to celebrate the New Year. Messages and Chinese-language media sent messages of panic, while busy shopping malls were empty, and dozens of closed-door restaurants convinced him of his judgment and sent short messages to the team - to Singapore, where the five-hour flight was needed, and China's transoceanic America shrugged off the outbreak.
1月20日是一个转折点。
20 January was a turning point.
那天中国国家卫健委发布公告，新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎纳入法定乙类传染病，按甲类管理，并就肺炎情况每日进行通报。
On that day, the Chinese National Fitness and Health Commission issued a notice, the new coronavirus infection pneumonia into the statutory B infectious diseases, according to category A management, and daily notification of pneumonia.
美股1月20日因“马丁·路德·金纪念日”而休市一天。
U.S. stocks were closed on January 20th for Martin Luther King Memorial Day.
1月21日中国决定全面抗疫——国际油价在那一天起开始了新一轮的下跌，中国抗疫导致的需求放缓，严格的隔离措施影响了石油消费。
On January 21, China decided to fight all-out epidemics - the day when international oil prices began a new round of falls, Chinese demand slowed as a result of the epidemic, and strict quarantine measures affected oil consumption.
实际上美股的第一轮下跌通道在1月21已经悄然打开，当天，美国疾病预防与控制中心(CDC)公布了美国境内第一例新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎病例。
Indeed, the first decline in US stocks was quietly opened on January 21, when the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced the first case of coronavirus infection in the United States.
1月24日CDC在电话简报中说，美国在22个州共有63例疑似病例。
In a telephone briefing on January 24, the CDC said the United States has 63 suspected cases in 22 states.
新冠肺炎疫情对全球金融市场走势形成打压的第一次突出表现是三天后的1月27日。
The first major blow to global financial markets from the outbreak was on January 27, three days later.
当天早间，道指一度下跌逾540点，衡量市场恐慌程度的CBOE波动率指数（VIX）大涨近42％，攀升至18.42点。
The Dow was down more than 540 points that morning, and the CBOE Volatility Index, a measure of market panic, jumped nearly 42% to 18.42.
美国两年期、五年期国债出现倒挂，为2019年12月4日以来首次。
For the first time since 4 December 2019, the two-year and five-year Treasury bonds of the United States were upside down.
王洲在新加坡看到美股三大指数当天收跌。
Wang saw the three U. S. stock indexes close lower in Singapore.
截至收盘，道指跌逾450点，跌幅为1.57％，纳指跌1.89％，标普500指数跌1.57％，其中道指遭受了自2019年10月以来的最大单日跌幅。
By the end of trading, the Dow was down more than 450 points, or 1.57 per cent, while the index was down 1.89 per cent and the S & P 500 was down 1.57 per cent, with the Dow suffering its biggest one-day drop since October 2019.
这让王洲有些失望。
This has disappointed Wang Zhou somewhat.
在美国股市去年拿到史上最好的回报率后，美股自满的情绪一发而不可收。
After the U. S. stock market got the best return in its history last year, complacency flared up.
尽管那时航空业、旅游业及其他与旅游业相关的酒店行业、邮轮已经受到打击，全球产业链也受到破坏，但市场仅仅小跌了一下。
While the airline industry, tourism and other tourism-related hotel industries, cruise ships had been hit and global industrial chains had been disrupted, the market had fallen only slightly.
在美国，金融服务公司B. Riley FBR Inc.首席全球策略师兼董事总经理马克·格兰特（Mark J. Grant）也紧盯着市场的起伏。
In the United States, Mark J. Grant, chief global strategist and managing director of financial-services firm B. Riley FBR Inc., is also watching the markets' ups and downs.
他对《财经》记者表示，“股市1月24日如此下跌，表明投资者非常担忧。
He told Caijing that "the fall in the stock market on January 24 shows that investors are very worried."
”但他随后话锋一转，说出了当时代表华尔街投资人的心态：现在具体评估该病毒对全球经济活动或全球金融市场的影响还为时过早，判断美国股市是否迎来拐点也为时尚早。
But he went on to say what then represented Wall Street investors: it was too early to assess specifically the impact of the virus on global economic activity or global financial markets, and it was too early to tell whether the stock market was on the cusp of an inflection point.
王洲所在的对冲基金QQQ那时对美股则更为看空，在1月底增加了对航空公司和酒店的空头押注，做空与旅游出行相关的股票，以及没有高成长性的汽车股，并做空标普500指数，以押注新冠肺炎疫情会恶化。
Mr. Wang's hedge fund, QQQ, was more bearish on U.S. stocks at the time, adding short bets on airlines and hotels in late January, shorting travel-related stocks, and doing the short-term Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to bet on a worsening crown-pneumonia epidemic.
在王洲看来，疫情升级要对冲风险。
In Wang Zhou's view, the escalation of the epidemic to hedge risks.
如果疫情大范围暴发，供应链受到很大冲击。
If the outbreak is widespread, the supply chain will be hit hard.
美国很多企业不仅依赖中国的市场，对中国的供应链依赖也很大。
Many US companies rely not only on the Chinese market, but also on China's supply chain.
2020年1月份，美股市场以上涨约1.2％收尾。
In January 2020, the US market closed up about 1.2 per cent higher.
大数据时代的恐慌指数深数宏观采用新颖的大数据方式判断疫情带来的情绪和它对市场的影响。
Big Data Age Panic Index Deep Number Macro uses novel big data to judge the mood of the epidemic and its impact on the market.
他们基于路透社新闻头条中对新冠肺炎疫情的语言处理——用语言的恐惧程度为指标，对比了与“冷静/平静”相关单词的数量，与“恐慌/担忧”相关单词的数量，得出对新冠肺炎疫情报道恐惧程度的净得分，负值意味着更恐惧/不大镇定，正值则意味少有恐惧/更镇定。
They based their verbal treatment of the outbreak on Reuters news headlines - comparing the number of words associated with "calm / calm" with the number of words associated with "panic / fear," given the number of words associated with "panic / worry," a negative value indicates more fear / less calm, and a positive word less fear / calmer.
通过这种更全球而非中国情绪的指标，他们发现“恐惧”情绪在2月1日达到顶峰。
Using this more global measure than Chinese sentiment, they found that "fear" had peaked on February 1.
尽管在2月9日和2月14日中的净恐惧增加，但这一情绪在那之后明显减少。
Although there was an increase in net fear on 9 February and 14 February, this sentiment has decreased significantly since then.
事实证明，在2月的相当长一段时间，全球的央行和华尔街的投资者都倾向于相信，疫情是中国的关切，是中国经济的威胁。
For much of February, central banks and Wall Street investors around the world proved inclined to believe that the outbreak was a Chinese concern and a threat to the Chinese economy.
美联储在提交给美国国会的货币政策报告中表示，最近暴发的新冠肺炎疫情可能会导致中国经济活动受扰，并会殃及全球其他经济体。
In its monetary-policy report to the U.S. Congress, the Fed said the recent outbreak of pneumonia could disrupt economic activity in China and hurt other economies around the world.
2月中旬花旗集团前全球外汇主管、深数宏观（DeepMacro）联合创始人兼CEO杰弗瑞·杨（Jeffrey Young）对《财经》记者表示，他们通过对网站实时追踪，通过大数据来判断疫情对经济的影响，以维基百科访问量为例，人们对“冠状病毒”中文简体维基百科的访问量领先英文版本的访问量。
In mid-February, Jeffrey Young, Citigroup's former global head of foreign exchange and co-founder and CEO of Deep Macro, told Caijing that they tracked websites in real time to gauge the economic impact of the epidemic through big data.
英文版本的信息对全球市场的影响最大，因此可通过观察中文简体版的访问量来预测全球市场的风险状况。
The English version of the information has the greatest impact on the global market, so it is possible to predict the risk profile of the global market by looking at the number of visits in simplified Chinese.
所以新冠肺炎那时不是影响全球市场的主要因素。
So new crown pneumonia was not the main factor affecting global markets at the time.
直到2月的最后一周，美国股市才被新冠肺炎疫情的恐惧所笼罩。
It was not until the last week of February that the US stock market was overshadowed by fears of a new outbreak of pneumonia.
杰弗瑞·杨说一个清晰的模式已经确立：新增确诊病例数=增加的市场恐慌=疲弱的资本市场。
Jeffery Young says a clear pattern has been established: the number of newly diagnosed cases = increased market panic = weak capital markets.
市场自2月21日起感到了疫情对全球经济的寒意，随着周末的到来，情况越来越糟。

Whether the Saudi crackdown on oil prices is a warning to Russia or a revelation, it is intended to recapture the US-usurped market share by forcing shale-oil production down - a $30-40 barrel cut, Robin Mills, chief executive of Dubai-based Qamar Energy, told Caijing that a collapse in oil prices would put a strain on US shale-oil producers.

市场已连续处于超卖状态。

美联储进退失据自2015年12月启动加息周期，美联储连续加息9次，并开启缩减资产负债表计划，以逐步退出金融危机后出台的超宽松货币政策。
The Fed has stepped back from the interest-rate hike cycle that began in December 2015, raising interest rates nine times in a row and initiating balance-sheet reduction plans to phase out the ultra-loose monetary policy that followed the financial crisis.
北京时间8月1日凌晨，美联储首次宣布降息25个基点，将联邦基金利率目标区间下调至2.00％－2.25％。

2019年全年，美联储共进行了3次降息，将短期利率降低了75个基点。
The Fed cut interest rates three times throughout 2019, cutting short-term rates by 75 basis points.
在相当长一段时间，华尔街倾向于相信，除非如美中贸易战出现大的升级，美联储很可能在可预见的未来不再降息。
For a long time, Wall Street was inclined to believe that, unless there was a major escalation in the US-China trade war, the Fed was likely not to cut interest rates in the foreseeable future.
2020年开局，尽管有美国与伊朗间紧张关系急遽升高之类的外部冲击，美联储对经济状况很有信心，对货币政策的立场也感到满意。
At the start of 2020, the Fed was confident of the state of the economy and satisfied with its stance on monetary policy, despite external shocks, such as a sharp rise in tensions between the US and Iran.
美联储在2月7日的半年度货币政策报告中指出，美联储去年三次降息后，当前的货币政策立场是合适的，能够支持美国经济活动持续扩张、劳动力市场强劲增长且通胀率位于“对称性的2％目标”。
As the Fed noted in its February 7 semi-annual monetary-policy report, after the Fed cut interest rates three times last year, the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate to support continued expansion of US economic activity, strong labor-market growth, and inflation at the "2% symmetry target."
2020年是选举年，自2017年任命鲍威尔为美联储主席以来，特朗普先后在推特上发文数十次，公开表达对鲍威尔的不满。
The year 2020 is an election year, and since Powell was appointed Chair of the US Federal Reserve in 2017, Trump has sent dozens of tweets publicly expressing his displeasure with Powell.
本来鲍威尔只是想在大选年里，能静观其变，保持独立性，平稳地走过这一年。
Powell just wanted to be able to sit tight, stand alone and get through the year smoothly in an election year.
但在2月最后一周美股创下2008年以来最惨跌幅后，鲍威尔在2月28日的声明中暗示，美联储已为下调利率做好准备，旨在缓解潜在公共卫生危机和全球经济放缓扩大对美国经济造成的影响。
But in a February 28 statement, Powell hinted at the Fed's readiness to cut interest rates in an attempt to mitigate the impact on the US economy of a potential public health crisis and a broader global economic slowdown, following the worst drop since 2008 in US stocks in the last week of February.
美股由此在3月2日全线上涨，道指从连续七个交易日的下跌中反弹，创下十多年来的最大单日涨幅，只因投资者押注各国央行能够稳定市场。
U.S. stocks rose across the board on March 2, as the Dow rallied from a seven-day decline to its biggest one-day gain in more than a decade as investors bet on central banks' ability to stabilize markets.
在疫情和市场的巨大双重压力下，美联储主席鲍威尔于当地时间3月3日出人意料地举行新闻发布会，宣布降低联邦基金利率50个基点至1％－1.25％，将超额准备金率（IOER）下调50个基点至1.1％，以应对新冠肺炎疫情给经济活动带来的风险。
On March 3, US Federal Reserve Chairman Colin Powell cut the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 1% to 1.25% and the excess reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points to 1.1% to address the risk to economic activity from the new crown pneumonia outbreak.
这是自2008年金融危机以来，美国首次采取紧急降息措施，也是自那时起幅度最大的一次降息。
It was the first emergency rate cut since the 2008 financial crisis and the largest since then.
但美联储的举动大大出乎市场预料，因它并不在美联储原定的联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）全年会议日程中，按照原定计划，3月份的议息会议将在3月17日-18日举行。
But the Fed acted far beyond market expectations, as it was not on the full-year agenda of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) scheduled for March 17-18, as originally planned.
在美联储如此强势反应下，3月3日美股延续了震荡走势，美三大股指窄幅高开后快速下探，跌幅均超1％，随后在美联储将基准利率下调50个基点消息刺激下直线拉升均涨超1.2％，随即深度下探，其中道指从高位下挫近1400点后小幅反弹，但跌幅仍高达近800点。
The Fed responded so strongly that on March 3, U.S. stocks continued to wobble, slipping more than 1% as the three broad U.S. stock indexes slid higher, down more than 1%, before plummeting by more than 1.2% as the Fed cut its benchmark rate by 50 basis points, and then dived deeper, with the Dow rallying slightly, but still down nearly 800 points.
在市场人士看来，美联储紧急降息意在回应投资者关切，原本有利于稳定市场预期。
The Fed's emergency rate cut was seen by market participants as a response to investor concerns and intended to help stabilize market expectations.
但同时，联储采取如此罕见举措，也暗示了目前市场和疫情问题之严重。
But at the same time, the Fed's rare moves suggest the scale of the current market and epidemic.
因此在防疫形势进一步明朗之前，市场恐慌并不会立即消除。
So the market panic will not dissipate immediately until the epidemic clears up.
马克·格兰特指出，市场预期到了美联储降息，但未有料到降的幅度一下子就是50个基点，现在如此靠近零利率的水平线，说明美联储的政策空间已经不大了。
Mark Grant points out that the market expected the Fed to cut interest rates, but that the unexpected drop was 50 basis points at a time, and is now so close to zero that the Fed's policy space is running low.
现在市场需要谨慎，非常谨慎。
Markets now need to be cautious and cautious.
在3月9日和12日道琼斯工业指数的下跌都超过了2000点，2月20日至3月12日，道琼斯工业指数、纳斯达克综合指数、标普500指数分别下跌27.76％、26.64％、26.74％后，美联储3月15日周日再次召开紧急会议，宣布降息100个基点，将基准利率降为0－0.25％，标志着在2008年金融危机之后，美国再次进入“零利率”时代。
After the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 2,000 points on March 9 and March 12, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Nasdaq Composite Index and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 27.76%, 26.64% and 26.74% respectively.
3月3日到15日13天合计降息150个基点，如此密集的降息在经济史上十分罕见，美联储创下了最短时间累计降息幅度最大的纪录。
With a combined cut of 150 basis points from March 3 to March 15, such an intensive rate cut is rare in economic history, with the Federal Reserve setting the record for the shortest cumulative rate cut.
可以参照的是，2008年1月22日到2月1日，美联储11天曾经两次降息合计125个基点。
By way of reference, the Fed cut interest rates twice in 11 days, from January 22 to February 1, 2008, for a total of 125 basis points.
金融危机后，美联储为挽救经济，曾一路降息至0－0.25％的超低水平，此后延续了七年的零利率政策。
In the wake of the financial crisis, the Fed cut interest rates to an ultra-low level of 0-0.25%, continuing a seven-year zero-interest-rate policy.
除降息之外，美联储还宣布了7000亿美元大规模的量化宽松计划，包括几个月内回购至少5000亿美元国债，增持至少2000亿美元规模的抵押担保证券。
In addition to cutting interest rates, the Federal Reserve announced a massive $700 billion program of quantitative easing, including buying back at least $500 billion in Treasury bonds within a few months and adding at least $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities.
这一举动也非同寻常。
This move is also unusual.
2008年金融危机后，美联储先后推出至少三轮量化宽松。
After the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed launched at least three rounds of quantitative easing.
首轮量化宽松，也就是金融体系最危急的时候，美联储直接购买“两房”债务及其抵押担保证券，此举支持金融机构信用，及时稳定了市场。
The first round of quantitative easing, when the financial system was at its most critical, saw the Fed buy Fannie and Freddie debt and its mortgage-backed securities directly, a move that bolstered the credit of financial institutions and stabilized markets in a timely manner.
对美联储此次出招，杰弗瑞·杨解读为是在寻求宣布效应（announcement effect）——特朗普此前刚宣布美国进入紧急状态，众议院迅速通过了疫情救助法案，加上美联储放大招，在政治经济上强强联合，在病毒面前形成珠联璧合之势。
Jaffrey Young interpreted the Fed's move as seeking to declare an effect - Trump had just declared a state of emergency in the US, the House of Representatives "swift passage of the epidemic-rescue bill, and the Fed's increased maneuver to forge a politically and economically powerful union that would match the virus's worth.
但美联储又一次迫不及待，又一次适得其反——市场把紧急降息看作事态严重的信号，更加剧了投资者的恐慌。
But the Fed is once again eager to backfire, with emergency interest-rate cuts seen as a serious signal to push investors into a panic.

I call the whole decade the steroid age, and I think the rise is largely due to the support of the Fed.
”达拉斯前联储主席理查德·费舍尔（Richard Fisher）指出，美联储真的想每次市场紧张的时候都马上救市吗？股市从历史高位跌落——美联储出手，似乎成了一个惯常套路，但问题是，美联储真的想一直这样，助长投资者的依赖心理，并把泡沫越吹越大？疫情是对这一套路最大的挑战者，市场情绪因之出现了从极端贪婪到全面恐慌情绪的转变。
Richard Fisher, the former president of the Federal Reserve in Dallas, points out that the Fed really wants to bail out every time markets get nervous? Stocks have fallen from historic highs - and the Fed seems to be doing the usual thing - but the problem is that the Fed really wants to keep this way, feeding investor dependency and inflating bubbles.
过去十年中，一些让美股维系牛市的操作思路变得派不上用场。
Over the past decade, some of the operational ideas that kept U. S. stocks in the bull market have become irrelevant.

Buying on your feet has proved time and again a rewarding strategy in this long bull market, but investors are finding that it is no longer easy to use and can fail at any time.

”在美股再次遭到猛烈抛售，恐慌指数持续攀升，债券等安全资产受到追捧之际，按同样的思路，事后证明，在疫情威胁下，各经济体都以宽松货币政策为主要基调。
Along the same lines as US stocks were again slammed, panic indices continued to rise, and safe assets such as bonds were sought after, it turned out that, in the face of the epidemic, economies were largely on a loose monetary policy stance.

也有更多的央行表示将加入议息的行列。
More central banks have also said they will join the consensus.
全球央行在危急关头祭出降息的法宝，问题是这次的“低”与过去十年牛市中投资者习惯了的“逢低买入”有所不同。
Central banks around the world are sacrificing interest-rate cuts at times of crisis, and the problem is that the "low" is different from the "buy low" that investors have been accustomed to in bull markets over the past decade.
杰弗瑞·杨指出，在过去十年中，人们接受的都是逢低买入的操作训练，因为它屡试不爽。
Over the past decade, says Jeffrey Young, people have been trained to buy low because it has been tried and tested.
