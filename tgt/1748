黄兴/劳动观察劳动报记者带你体验一场奇妙的流行病学史调查之旅。
Huangxing / Labor Watch Labour News takes you on an amazing epidemiological investigation tour.
眼下，上海每天两次发布新冠肺炎患者的确诊和疑似病例人数。
Now, twice a day, Shanghai is reporting the number of confirmed and suspected cases of pneumonia.
在关注数据上下起伏的同时，还有一个问题也牵动着大家的心，那就是每个确诊和疑似患者的行动轨迹。
As we focus on the ups and downs of the data, there is also a question that touches on the trajectory of each confirmed and suspected patient.
他们去过什么地方了？和哪些人接触过？会不会和我的生活产生交集？从字面上看，患者行动轨迹只是几个简单的场所，但这些地点以及相关的密切接触者是如何挖掘出来的？做个小测试：你能回忆起昨天在哪儿干了些啥么？一周前呢？两周前？越往前推，记忆越是模糊。
Where have they been, with whom have they met, or have they interacted with my life? Literally, the patient's trajectory is a few simple places, but how are these locations and their close contacts excavated? A little test: Can you remember what happened yesterday? A week ago? The further you pushed? The fainter the memory.
抽丝剥茧、模拟推导，最终将人的只言片语拼凑成一张张完整的患者轨迹图，这就是流行病学史调查员的工作。
Splitting cocoons, simulating derivations, and eventually piecing bits of human speech together into a complete picture of the patient's trajectory, is the job of the epidemiological history investigator.
为了还原神秘的流调工作，劳动报记者来到了闵行区疾控中心蹲点，跟着这些“侦探们”体验了一场奇妙的“绘图”之旅。
In order to restore the mysterious transfer work, labor reporters to Minhang District CDC squat, and then these "detectives" experienced a wonderful "mapping" trip.
时间：2月18日14：40地点：闵行区疾控中心总值班室“泓泓，你负责这个病例，他之前去过五院，有发热症状。
Date: Feb. 18, 14: 40 Location: Minhang District CDC General Duty Room "Honghong, you are in charge of this case, he has been to the hospital before, has febrile symptoms.
”1楼总值班室内，值班员金宝芳递给流调员陈泓泓一张从第五人民医院传真过来的疑似病例门诊单。
On the first floor in the general duty room, duty officer Jin Baofang handed Kuan Wang, a dispatcher, a list of suspected cases faxed from the Fifth People's Hospital.
闵行区疾控中心的流调小组有42个人，他们肩负着区内所有医疗机构的流调工作。
Min Hang District CDC mobility team of 42 people, they are responsible for the transfer of all medical institutions in the region.
陈泓泓就是其中之一。
Wang Hong is one of them.
她迅速浏览了一遍疑似患者基本情况，迈开步子冲向应急物资准备室，换上白大褂，拖出一个拉杆行李箱。
She quickly skimmed through the basic details of the suspected patient, stepped into the emergency supplies room, changed into a white coat, and pulled out a leash suitcase.
这个箱子就是流调员陈泓泓的流调包。
This box is the tuner Chen Kuang-hong.
“一次性口罩10个，N95口罩2个，防护服2套，免洗消毒液1瓶……”她快速清点完物资，又抓起一台笔记本电脑和一个样本箱，直奔院子。
"Ten disposable masks, two N95 masks, two suits of protective clothing, one bottle of disinfectant..." She quickly counted the supplies, grabbed a laptop and a sample box, and headed for the yard.
院子里，一辆出勤车正等着她。
In the yard, an attendance car was waiting for her.
半小时后，她将抵达市第五人民医院，完成疑似患者小朱的流行病学史调查，同时带回检测样本。
Half an hour later, she will arrive at the Fifth People's Hospital to complete an epidemiological investigation of the suspected patient Zhu and bring back a sample.
上车坐稳，陈泓泓立刻打开电脑，手指飞快地输入病例信息。
When you get in the car, open the computer at once with your fingers racing to input case information.
这是她参与流调工作后积攒的经验。
This is the experience she has accumulated since her transfer.
按规定，从接到医院通知那刻起，她必须在2小时内填写完成流调核心信息报告，24小时内提交完整报告。
As a rule, from the moment she is notified by the hospital, she must complete the core information report within two hours and submit the complete report within 24 hours.
除去路上花费的时间，留给她完成核心信息录入的时间不足1小时。
Excluding the time spent on the road, less than an hour was left for her to complete the core information entry.
时间争分夺秒。
Time tries all the time.
在颠簸的车上，陈泓泓一边对照着门诊单，一边填表，身体和电脑随着汽车的摇晃而左右摇摆。
On the bumpy car, with the front side of the clinic list, fill in the form while the body and computer sway to and fro with the car.
时间：2月18日15：46地点：上海市第五人民医院第一次来五院做流调，不小心迷了路。
February 18, 15: 46 locations: Shanghai Fifth People's Hospital for the first time to the Fifth Hospital to do the transfer, accidentally lost the way.
兜兜转转，陈泓泓终于找到僻静的办公室，拨通了疑似病例小朱的电话。
As she circled, Chen finally found the quiet office and dialed Xiao Zhu, the suspected case.
她铺开一张A4白纸，接下来的1个小时里，这张纸上将如实记录下所有的时间节点。
She rolled out an A4 blank sheet of paper that would record all the time nodes for the next hour.
流行病学史调查最核心的内容是追踪病例出现症状前14天的行动轨迹。
At the heart of the epidemiological history survey is tracking the course of action 14 days before the onset of symptoms.
小朱是2月13日被社区工作人员送往集中隔离点的。
Zhu was transported to the quarantined site by community workers on 13 February.
而在1月27日-2月5日间，他和妻子都在外地探亲。
On the other hand, between 27 January and 5 February, he and his wife visited their families abroad.
陈泓泓在纸上迅速列了一个时间轴，1月27日—2月14日，后面空出来填写具体人员、活动。
Wang Wang wrote a timeline on the paper at once. January 27 to February 14 will be available at the back to fill in the blanks with details of personnel and activities.
“探亲这段时间，你和谁在一起，去了哪儿？”“怎么去的火车站，坐的哪班车？”“去过公共场所吗？比如超市、公园…”这是流调员问的最多的问题。
During the visit, who were you with and where were you? How did you get to the train station, what bus did you take? Have you ever been to a public place, like a supermarket, a park, etc. This is the most frequently asked question by the dispatcher.
所有的问题都围绕着“时间、地点、人物”进行。
All questions revolve around "time, place, and person."
“我，我真的想不起来了。
"I don't really remember.
”当问到其中一天具体活动场所，电话那头的小朱卡了壳。
"When asked about one of the day's activities, the little Jukka sat on the other end of the line.
对于两周前的事情，他脑子里乱哄哄的，更何况他是第一次去那里，地名根本记不全。
His mind was full of confusion over the events of two weeks before, and besides, it was the first time he had been there, and the names were not exactly remembered.
“别急，是和老婆出去逛街了吗？有没有在小区里遛一遛？”陈泓泓感觉对话陷入了死胡同，试着建立可行性场景，模拟当时的行为，“你可以看看手机照片，说不定有记录。
"Don't worry, is it time to go shopping with your wife? Do you have a stroll in the community?" Chen Wang felt that the dialogue had fallen into a dead end.
”“就在小区里转了转，主要是陪岳父岳母。
"" I walked around the neighborhood, mainly with my father-in-law and mother-in-law.
平时烧饭也是他们负责。
They are also responsible for cooking at ordinary times.
”随着陈泓泓的引导，小朱似乎想起些什么。
"With the Wang guidance, Xiao Zhu seems to remember something.
“那你和老婆出去买过菜吗？”陈泓泓又提出一种可能。
"So have you been out shopping with your wife?" Chen Wang suggested another possibility.
“也没有。
"Not at all.
”“2月6日回到上海后，做了些什么事？”“我…我还是想不起来…”说到这里，小朱开始焦急起来。
"What did you do when you returned to Shanghai on February 6?" "I... I still can't remember..." And with that, Xiao Zhu became anxious.
感觉到小朱情绪上的变化后，陈泓泓改变了直接询问的方式，开始拉起了家常。
Seeing the change in Zhu's mood, Chen Wang changed the way she asked directly and began to pull the family tree.
“这么久没回家，家里应该没菜了吧？有没有出去买菜？”“去了去了！”彷佛一下子打开了记忆的大门，小朱开始陆续说出行程细节……“菜场地址是哪里？几点去的？”“我查查看…”在陈泓泓的提醒下，小朱通过支付宝账单找到了当天的确切时间地点。
"So long did not return home, should there be no food at home?" "Go shopping?" "Yes!" As if to open the door to memory, Zhu began to tell details of the itinerary... "Where is the vegetable farm address?" "I checked..."
陈泓泓悬着的一颗心终于放下了。
The heart that hangs on Chen finally lies down.
在流行病学史调查过程中，像这样引导患者回忆的小方法还有很多。
In the course of an epidemiological investigation, there are many small ways to guide patients' memories like this.
比如通过手机上的支付证明、票据等，可以找到具体的时间和地点。
For example, through the mobile phone payment certificates, bills, you can find the specific time and place.
通过照片，也能找得出行动轨迹或者引发回忆。
Photographs can also be used to track action or trigger memories.
如果还是没办法确定，就以患者家属为突破口，患者和家人共同回忆当时场景，一步步引导，同时也是一步步印证。
If there is still no way to determine, to the patient's family as a breakthrough, patients and their families together to recall the scene, step by step guidance, but also step by step.
时间：2月18日17：26地点：出勤车从疾控中心出来时，还是阳光明媚；收工返程时，已是夕阳西下。
Time: February 18 17: 26 Location: Attendance car from the CDC, the sun is still bright; return from work, it is sunset.
上了车，陈泓泓第一件事便是掏出随身携带的矿泉水，猛喝了一口。
When you get in the car, Chen Wang's first thing is to take out the mineral water you carry with you and take a quick drink.
1小时的“聊天”，没有一分钟的停顿，她早已口干舌燥，嗓子嘶哑。
An hour of "chatting", without a minute's pause, she had become dry and hoarse.
稍微缓了缓后，陈泓泓又开始填表，在之前记录表上圈重点。
When you slow down slightly, Chen Wang begins to fill in the form again, circling the key points on the previous chart.
一份准确完整的流调报告，必须详细记录下患者在各个时间节点里所有的活动，并要形成一条完整的证据链。
An accurate and complete flow report must record in detail all patient activity at each point in time and form a complete chain of evidence.
这意味着，患者的行动轨迹必须经得起推敲，行为符合逻辑，每个环节都要尽可能细致。
This means that the patient's path of action must stand up to scrutiny, act logically, and be as meticulous as possible at every link.
任何一个细节的缺失，都有可能使报告推倒重来。
Any lack of detail could turn the report over.
陈泓泓习惯在回程路上就开始复盘整个活动轨迹。
On the return journey, Chen Wang habitually begins to turn the whole track.
因为患者记忆常会有偏差，复盘时就会发现其行为逻辑上的不顺畅，一旦看出问题，流调员就可以在第一时间联系患者或者家属复核情况。
Because the patient's memory is often biased, when the disk will find its logical behavior is not smooth, once the problem, the mediator can contact the patient or family review the situation at the first time.
时间：2月19日00：38地点：闵行区疾控中心总值班室输完最后一个空格，鼠标轻点“保存”，小朱的流行病学史调查报告终于完工了。
Time: Feb. 19 00: 38 Location: Minhang District CDC total duty room finished the last space, the mouse click "save", Zhu's epidemiological history investigation report was finally completed.
陈泓泓长吁了一口气。
Chen Wang heaved a sigh.
这时她才发现自己有些饿了，于是从旁边的柜子中取出一碗方便面。
Then she realized that she was a little hungry, so she took a bowl of instant noodles from the cupboard next to her.
熬夜吃夜宵，这是她长期以来加班养成的习惯。
It is her habit to stay up late for supper.
事实上，这不是陈泓泓第一次凌晨加班。
In fact, this is not Chen's first morning overtime.
对于流调员来说，24小时待命值守是家常便饭。
24-hour on-call duty is the norm for mobility officers.
而流调时间常常集中在下午，甚至是凌晨。
And the shift time is often concentrated in the afternoon, or even in the early morning.
收到医院发来的疑似病例信息，便要立即出发。
On receiving the suspected case information from the hospital, we will set out immediately.
从疫情发生以来，流调任务非常繁重，队员们都自觉守在疾控中心待命，只为了减少路上来回的时间。
Since the outbreak of the epidemic, the transfer task is very heavy, the team members are consciously on standby at the CDC, just to reduce the time to return to and from the road.
这天凌晨，这份花费了9个多小时的行动轨迹图被火速上报。
In the early morning hours of the day, the road map, which had taken more than nine hours, was rushed to report.
几个小时后，天光放亮，一场围绕患者小朱的流行病防疫战在全市的各个角落打响了。
Hours later, daylight dawned, and an epidemic of epidemic prevention around Zhu rang out in every corner of the city.
