武汉封城后，这位送菜员披星戴月为居民送菜，每天只睡四五个小时，经常一天只吃一顿饭。
Wuhan after the city, the delivery of food to the residents, only four or five hours a day, often only one meal a day.
他明显消瘦下来。

3月2日这天，他量了体重，比一个月前掉了18斤。
On March 2nd he measured his weight and lost 18 jin from a month ago.
38岁的马增辰是一家网络生鲜平台武汉站的送菜员。
Ma Zengchen, 38, is a dish carrier at Wuhan Station, a new online platform.
新冠肺炎疫情之下，武汉市1月23日封城，2月11日开始对所有住宅小区实行封闭管理。
The city of Wuhan, which was closed on January 23 and closed to all residential districts on February 11, was hit by the outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia.
他服务的企业是市商务局向居民推荐的线上购菜平台之一。
The company he serves is one of the online food-buying platforms recommended to residents by the city's commercial bureau.
他忽然成了这座城市的“民生保障工作人员”之一。
He suddenly became one of the city's "people's security workers."
平均每天，马增辰给60-80个家庭送去新鲜蔬菜和肉类。
On average, 60-80 families are given fresh vegetables and meat every day on Ma Zengchen Day.
送菜员服务范围点多面广，工作半径可达二三十公里。
The range of service points is wide, working radius can reach 20 or 30 kilometers.
如今派单量约为平时的3倍，忙到晚上10点是常态。
It's now about three times as much as usual, and it's the norm to be busy until 10 pm.
马增辰是外地人，租住在武汉市江夏区庙山社区。
Ma Zhenchen is a stranger, rented in Wuhan Jiangxia Miaoshan community.
小区正门往北有一道铁栅栏门，疫情期间封闭。
The main gate of the community north of an iron fence door, closed during the outbreak.
他夜里回来，一般在此处停车，对象汪江艳会在栅栏另一侧等着“接头”。
He comes back at night, usually parking here, object Wang Jiangyan will be waiting on the other side of the fence "joint."
隔着栅栏，她给他递过热饭，说一会儿话。
Over the fence, she handed him overheated rice and talked for a while.
为了节约汽车蓄电池电量，汪江艳还要把他的手机拿回家充电。
In order to save battery power, Wang Jianyan will have to take his mobile phone home to recharge.
有时，马增辰连饭都不想吃，只想睡觉。
Sometimes the horse does not even want to eat meals, just want to sleep.
他们原计划2020年春节回老家登记结婚，车票都买好了，武汉封城了。
They had planned to return home in 2020 to register marriage, tickets have been bought, Wuhan closed.
医院里人满为患，街道上见不到什么人。
The hospital was so full that few people could be seen on the street.
他们也有点害怕。
They're a little scared, too.
汪江艳记得，她有次劝马增辰：“咱要不别干了，你看大街上谁那么拼命啊？”马增辰没接话。
Wang Jiang Yan remembers that she once advised his horse to increase his horse. "If we don't do it, who's working so hard on the street?" Ma Zhenchen didn't answer.
他们有孩子要养，有债务要还。
They have children to support and debts to pay.
去年12月，他们在庙山社区开了一家“快乐柠檬”奶茶店，“遇到这个事情（指新冠肺炎）就‘熄火’了”。
Last December, they opened a Happy Lemon Milk Tea Shop in the Miyama community. "It turned out to be the case."
汪江艳把“快乐柠檬”库存的柠檬切成片，等到晚上，给马增辰准备一桶浮着柠檬切片的热水。
Mr. Wang sliced the lemon from Happy Lemon stock and at night prepared a bucket of hot water with slices of lemon.
社区封闭后的头几天，马增辰能够凭证明出入小区。
During the first few days after the closure of the community, Ma Zengchen was able to prove access to the community.
他手机里存着3份电子版证明。
He has three electronic testimonials in his mobile phone.
两份是武汉市商务局的证明，证明马增辰所在公司为“重要民生保障企业”，员工为“民生保障工作人员”，承担“生活必需品、防护用品”供应任务，需要在保供物资采购、道路通行、人员通勤等方面给予优先保障。
The two certificates issued by the Wuhan Bureau of Commerce prove that Ma Zhenchen's company is an "important livelihood security enterprise," that the employees are "people's livelihood security workers" and undertake the task of supplying "necessities of life and protective articles.
另一份是“新型肺炎防疫保供车辆证明”，上面有马增辰的身份证号和车牌号，盖了武汉市商务局和他所在公司的公章。
The other is the "New Pneumonia Vaccination Guarantee Vehicle Certificate," which has Ma Zhenchen's identity card number and license plate number, stamped with the official seal of Wuhan Commercial Bureau and his company.
在别的不同小区，马增辰的同事凭借这些证明，每天通过体温检测后，一直能够顺利出入。
In different neighborhoods, Ma Zhenchen's colleagues have been able to get in and out every day after passing a temperature test based on these certificates.
3月3日，其中一位向记者确认了这一点。
On 3 March, one of them confirmed this to journalists.
但是2月18日那天，这些证明在庙山社区门口失灵了。
But on Feb. 18, the certificates failed in front of the Temple Mount neighborhood.
马增辰说，他送菜返回后，社区“封控管理岗”工作人员向他要纸质版证明，等他跑回公司打印好，对方又称“打印出来的是黑章子，要红章子才行”。
Ma said that when he returned from his trip, the community "Seal Management Gang" asked him for a paper version of his certificate, and when he ran back to the company to print it out, he said, "It's a black chapter, a red one."
后来，公司专门给他开了一份“员工证明”，证明马增辰参与“民生和医疗物资配送工作”。
Later, the company issued him a "staff certificate" to prove that Ma Zhenchen participated in "people's livelihood and medical supplies distribution work."
汪江艳记得，一位社区工作人员随后又说，此时马增辰离开小区已经超过24小时，如果回家，需要居家隔离14天。
Mr. Wang remembers that a community worker later said Mr. Ma had been out of the neighborhood for more than 24 hours and would have to be kept in isolation for 14 days if he returned home.
庙山开发区管委会办公室一位工作人员对记者确认了这一说法：马增辰当时有两个选择——要么回家隔离，要么不进小区。
A staff member at the Diaoshan Development Zone Administration Office confirmed to reporters that Ma had two options - either to go home and quarantine or not to go into the community.
这位工作人员未解释此举的依据。
The staff member did not explain the basis for this action.
“隔离14天，那怎么行呢？我们还要挣钱养家。
"Fourteen days of isolation, how can that be? We have to earn money to support our families.
”汪江艳说。
"said Wang.
他们算过，老人、孩子，店租、车贷、房贷，即使自己不吃不喝，每月开支也要1万多元。
They calculated that the elderly, children, shop rental, car loans, even if they do not eat or drink, the monthly expenditure should be more than 10,000 yuan.
2月18日起，马增辰以车为家。

马增辰在面包车里休息。
Ma Zhenchen rested in the van.
中青报·中青网记者耿学清/摄公司要求送菜员每天凌晨3点到仓库，他会提前一个半小时——晚了要等其他同事用完扫码枪才能提货。
Zhongqing Zhongqing correspondent Geng Xueqing / Photographer asks the delivery man to arrive at the warehouse at 3: 00 a.m. every morning. He will arrive an hour and a half early and wait for the other colleagues to pick up the goods with their sweeps.
早上6点左右，他开始往武汉市区送菜。
Around 6 a. m., he began to deliver food to Wuhan.
马增辰说，新手一般一天送“一条线路”，他从2019年7月开始做这份工，每天会送两三条线路。
Mr. Ma says novices typically deliver 'a route' a day, which he started doing in July 2019, delivering two or three routes a day.
有时为了多挣钱，会申请多加一条线路。
Sometimes, in order to make more money, they apply for an extra line.
每条线路上约有20多位客户，需要半天时间。
Each line has about 20 customers and takes half a day.
对他来说，理想的状况是所有客户能在一个小区，但这“太难遇到了”。
For him, the ideal situation would be for all customers to be in a small area, but it would be "too difficult to meet."
有四五户在一个小区，就会节省很多时间，他就“太感谢了”。
With four or five families in a small area, he would save a lot of time.
他回家越来越晚。
He went home later and later.
汪江艳准备的晚饭，是马增辰一天里唯一的正餐。
The dinner prepared by Wang Jiang Yan is the only main meal in Ma Zhenchen's day.
很大的碗，小区铁栅栏缝隙塞不过去，只能从底下递过去，他就在冷风里吃。
Large bowl, small iron fence gap can not plug, can only pass from the bottom, he is eating in the cold wind.
偶尔他会在公司泡一桶方便面。
Occasionally he would make a bucket of instant noodles in the company.
在路上，他想吃方便面都找不到热水。
On the way, he couldn't find hot water for his instant noodles.
送菜人马增辰。

中青报·中青网记者耿学清/摄他的睡眠严重不足。
Zhongqing News Zhongqing net reporter Geng Xueqing / He is seriously sleep deprived.
2月29日晚，中国青年报·中国青年网记者见到马增辰时，他刚刚结束了20.5个小时的工作。
When a reporter from China Youth Daily saw Ma Zhenchen on the evening of Feb. 29, he had just finished 20.5 hours of work.
记者跟汪江艳说话的功夫，他把驾驶座放倒，顺势躺在椅背上，不一会儿就响起了鼾声。
When the reporter talked with Wang Jiang Yan, he put the driver down and lay down on the back of his chair. Soon it began to snore.
他抓紧时间补觉，每天在车里和衣而睡，盖条毯子。

只有一条毯子。
There's only one blanket.
“说出来挺不好意思的，家里只有一床薄被子。
"I'm sorry to say that, but I only have a thin quilt at home.
”汪江艳说，以前冬天会回老家过，在武汉没有准备厚被子，现在想买又无处可买。
"Wang Jiangyan said that he would go back to his hometown in winter. He didn't prepare thick quilts in Wuhan, and now he has nowhere to buy them.
武汉最近的夜间最低气温是5℃。
The lowest temperature in Wuhan recently is 5 ℃.
马增辰有时会被冻醒。
The horse sometimes wakes up in the cold.
他会启动汽车，开会儿空调取暖，之后再关掉，“开空调时间长了会有危险”。
He would start the car, have a meeting to warm up the air conditioner, and then turn it off.
所幸，他一直干体力活儿，身体壮实，还没有感冒过。
Fortunately, he had worked hard, was strong, and had not caught a cold.
每隔三四天，晚上下班公司人少时，马增辰会拿着脸盘在洗手间接一些热水擦洗身子。
Every three or four days, when the office is small, Ma Zengchen will pick up some hot water in the washroom with his face and plate.
他尽量在公司如厕，有时夜里实在内急，就到附近的小树林里解决——非常时期的无奈之举。
He tried to toilet in the company, sometimes really urgent at night, to the nearby woods to solve - very difficult times.
马增辰说，这点苦都不算什么，最麻烦的是和父母视频聊天。
Ma Zhenchen said that this is nothing, the most troublesome is to chat with their parents video.
父母很惦记他们，几乎每天早上9点前都会跟他们视频聊天，叮嘱不要出门。
My parents are thinking of them, and they will have a video chat with them almost every morning before 9am, telling them not to go out.
为了避免让父母发现自己外出送菜，马增辰有时找个墙角，有时在厕所里，和老人说几句话。
In order to avoid their parents find themselves out to deliver food, Ma Zengchen sometimes find a corner, sometimes in the toilet, and the old man to say a few words.
有一次，他被父亲看出是在车里，只好解释说“车子长时间没动，出来溜溜”。
Once, he was seen by his father in the car, had to explain that "the car did not move for a long time, out to slip."
马增辰17岁那年来到武汉，在做送菜员之前，靠蹬三轮车配送水果谋生。
Ma Zhenchen came to Wuhan at the age of 17 and made his living by pedaling fruit before serving as a waiter.
他跟朋友做过水果生意，亏了。
He lost money in the fruit business with his friends.
2018年，他咬咬牙买了这辆金杯面包车。
In 2018, he gritted his teeth and bought the golden cup van.
车款是6.3万多元，汪江艳透支了十余张信用卡以及“花呗”额度交了首付，每个月要还1430元车贷。
Car is more than 63, 000 yuan, Wang Jiangyan overdraft more than a dozen credit cards and "Bai Bai" amount to pay the down payment, every month to repay 1430 yuan car loans.
马增辰格外爱惜这辆车。
Ma Zhenchen treasured the car very much.
平时只要没什么事，他会拿着水管冲洗车身，“车这种东西，怎么说呢，你爱惜它，它就给你好好干活。
Usually as long as nothing, he will hold the hose washing body, "This kind of thing, how to say, you cherish it, it will give you good work.
”现在，这辆车成了他临时的栖身之地。
Now the car had become his temporary shelter.
庙山新村村支部书记孙勇向记者表示，马增辰在外面待了这么长时间，他不清楚具体原因，也没遇到过类似情况。
Sun Yong, secretary of the village branch of Miaoshan Xincun, told reporters that Ma had spent so much time outside.
他还说，并不存在居民离开小区24小时就要居家隔离14天的规定。
He also said there was no 14-day rule that residents should stay in their homes for up to 24 hours after they leave their homes.
他以为，马增辰每天是在外面卖菜。
He thought Ma Zhenchen was selling vegetables outside every day.
3月2日晚，村委会一名工作人员提出了两个解决方案：马增辰若需返回居住地，需要体检，排除新冠肺炎，然后居家隔离14天；如果隔离14天对工作有影响，村里会给他送两床被子。
On the evening of 2 March, a village council staff member proposed two solutions: a medical check-up for Ma Zhenchen if he had to return to his place of residence, removal of pneumonia for a period of 14 days, and two quilts in the village if the 14-day isolation had an impact on work.
马增辰说，每天进仓库经过两道门，测两次体温，到现在都是正常的，有登记记录，“如果不正常怎么能给市民送菜呢？”武汉整个城市按下暂停键后，马增辰遇到最多的是志愿者、快递小哥、外卖骑手以及他这样的送菜员。
Ma Zhenchen said that every day into the warehouse through two doors, temperature testing is now normal, there is a record, "if abnormal how to send food to the public?" Wuhan press the moratorium key, Ma Zengchen encountered volunteers, express brother, takeaway riders and other food carriers such as him.
他感到，特殊时期，业务量剧增，而苛刻的顾客少了。
He felt that, in special times, the volume of business had increased dramatically and the number of demanding customers had decreased.
偶尔遇到订单不符、分拣遗漏等情况，从没有人为难他。
Occasionally encountered orders do not match, sorting out omissions, and so on, no one embarrassed him.
几乎所有客户都表现出了非凡的大度，“这个时候，都能理解”。
Almost all the customers showed extraordinary generosity, "at this point, can understand."
因为“无接触”式送菜，把蔬菜送到指定地点后，马增辰会在电话里听到很多声“谢谢”。
Because of the "no contact" type of food delivery, the vegetables to the designated place, Ma Zengchen will hear a lot of "thank you" in the telephone.
他到武汉打工21年了，从没像这个月这样，感到如此“被大家需要、尊重”，这让他干起活儿来“很起劲”。
He has been working in Wuhan for 21 years and has never felt so needed and respected as he did this month, which has made him "very energetic" in his work.
只是到了晚上，在那道铁栅栏之外，躺在车里，他才会感觉自己是个外乡人。
It was only at night, outside the grating and in the car, that he felt like a stranger.
