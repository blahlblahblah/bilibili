新冠肺炎确诊者周巧儿的爱犬，早前经香港渔农自然护理署两次病毒测试，发现其口腔及鼻腔样本呈弱阳性反应。
A dog of the Hong Kong Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has tested positive for oral and nasal samples of his pet dog, Chow Qiao-err, who was diagnosed with pneumonia.
4日，渔护署表示，有关结果显示这只狗已经低程度感染病毒，成为世界首例。
On April 4, AFCD said the results showed that the dog had been infected with the virus at a low level, making it the first case in the world.
香港政府网截图头条日报网4日称，渔护署曾征询港大、城市大学及世界动物卫生组织专家的意见，他们一致认同有关结果显示这只狗已低程度感染有关病毒，并很可能是由人类传染的。
AFCD consulted experts from HKU, City University and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and agreed that the results showed that the dog had been infected with the virus at a low level and was likely to be human-borne, according to the online headline 4 of the Hong Kong Government website.
目前，这只狗正在港珠澳大桥口岸动物居留所接受检疫。
The dog is currently being quarantined at the animal shelter at the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge.
目前，该狗并没有出现任何病征。
At present, the dog did not show any symptoms.
兽医：狗只染病不等于能在体内繁殖病毒兽医黎昌生说，渔护署应向公众交代什么是“低程度感染”新冠肺炎，他个人的解读为病毒数目少。
Veterinary Surgeons: A dog infected with a disease does not mean that it can reproduce in vivo. Veterinary Officer Lai Chansheng said AFCD should explain to the public what is meant by "low-level" pneumonia.
他认为，狗只从人类感染病毒，不等于能在体内繁殖病毒，所以暂时未有证据显示它存在任何播毒风险。
He believes that dogs infected with the virus from humans do not reproduce the virus in the body, so there is no immediate evidence of any risk.
另外，不少冠状病毒能在环境残存数天，所以不能排除狗只的鼻腔及口腔适合病毒存活，此情况并不代表会造成发病或传播病毒。
In addition, many coronavirus can remain in the environment for a few days. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that the nasal cavity and oral cavity of a dog are suitable for the virus to survive.
黎昌生呼吁市民，不需要对狗只感到恐慌，“因为狗只很大机会是从主人身上染病，而所有患者的宠物都要去动物居留所接受检疫，所以不需要担心。
Mr Lai urged the public not to panic about dogs, "because dogs have a good chance of getting sick from their owners and all patients' pets go to animal shelters for quarantine, so there is no need to worry."
”他强调，狗只在街上染病的机会极小。
He stressed that dogs have little chance of getting sick on the streets.
他提醒狗主要注意个人卫生，遛狗时使用狗带，以防狗只乱碰周遭物品，并避免接近街上的其他狗主。
He reminded dogs to observe good personal hygiene and to use a leash when walking their dogs to prevent them from touching objects around them and avoid approaching other dog owners on the street.
爱护动物协会：狗只病毒很可能由人类传染爱护动物协会表示，该狗只并没有出现任何病征，目前非常健康，在检疫中心内状况良好。
Society for the Protection of Animals: Dogs are likely to be infected by human-to-animal transmission. The dog does not show any symptoms and is now very healthy and in good condition at the quarantine centre.
爱协建议公众了解“被感染”，并不等于“具有传染性”、“能够将新型冠状病毒传播”，现在没有证据显示动物能够将病毒传播给人类。
The association advises the public that being infected does not mean it is "infectious" or "capable of spreading the new coronavirus," and there is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans.
爱协也认为，狗只的病毒很可能是由人类传染。
The association also believes that the dog virus is likely to be transmitted by humans.
因此，爱协建议宠物主人保持严格的个人卫生习惯，如果主人怀疑自己感染了病毒，则应考虑限制与宠物接触。
Therefore, the Association advised pet owners to maintain strict personal hygiene habits, if the owner suspects that they are infected with the virus, should consider limiting contact with pets.
城大赛马会动物医学及生命科学院巴斯（Vanessa Barrs）教授称，这些测试结果显示该狗只的感染程度低。
Professor Vanessa Barrs, of the Jockey Club School of Animal Medicine and Life Sciences, said the tests showed a low level of infection in the dog.
根据2003年SARS经验，感染病毒的猫狗不会生病，亦不会将病毒传给人类，没有证据显示猫狗等宠物会将病毒传给人类。
According to the 2003 SARS experience, dogs and cats infected with the virus do not get sick, do not transmit the virus to humans, and there is no evidence that pets such as cats and dogs transmit the virus to humans.
专家：不排除狗与狗之间会互相感染香港医学会传染病顾问委员会主席梁子超表示，冠状病毒由人传动物并不出奇，因为冠状病毒可以广泛存在于不同动物身上，17年前曾研究SARS病毒在猫身上出现，而如今新冠病毒则出现在狗只身上。
Expert: It is not ruled out that dogs and dogs can infect each other. Liang Zichao, Chairman of the Infectious Diseases Advisory Committee of the Hong Kong Medical Association, said that the coronavirus is not uncommon because it can be found in many different animals.
他说，由于该狗只没有发病，相信过一段时间后其体内的抗体能清除相关病毒，他呼吁饲养宠物的主人不必过分担心。
Since the dog did not develop symptoms, he said, he believed antibodies in his body could clear the virus over time and appealed to pet owners not to worry too much.
不过，不排除狗与狗之间会互相感染，因此现阶段避免狗只与其他动物接触，若是主人染病，则避免自己与家中的宠物接触。
However, it is not ruled out that dogs and dogs can infect each other, so avoid contact with other animals at this stage, or with their pets at home if the owner is sick.
接触猫狗前后须洗手世卫组织官网显示，现无证据显示狗猫等宠物会感染新型冠状病毒，但人与宠物接触后，用肥皂和水洗手，可显著减少大肠杆菌、沙门氏菌等常见细菌在宠物和人类之间传播。
Wash hands before and after handling dogs and cats There is no evidence that pets such as dogs and cats are infected with the new coronavirus, but washing hands with soap and water after contact with pets can significantly reduce the spread of common bacteria, such as E. coli and salmonella, between pets and humans.
中国（香港）兽医学会会长萧嘉和提醒宠主接触猫狗前后须洗手；猫狗从户外回家后，应洗擦四肢，减低沾染病毒风险。
The Director of the Veterinary Medicine Council of China (Hong Kong), Mr Bernard Shaw, reminded pet owners to wash their hands before and after coming into contact with dogs and cats.
世界卫生组织表示，关注香港有狗只对新型冠状病毒呈弱阳性反应，世卫正在与香港卫生当局及科学家一起工作，研究狗只的病毒结果，以进一步了解该个案是属于被感染，还是从受污染环境黏上病毒。
The World Health Organisation (WHO) said it was concerned that dogs in Hong Kong were weak positive for the new coronavirus. WHO was working with Hong Kong health authorities and scientists to study the results of the virus in dogs to find out whether the case belonged to an infected person or had been infected with the virus from the contaminated environment.
世卫会继续跟进香港对该狗只的测试及检疫工作。
WHO will continue to follow up on the testing and quarantine of the dog in Hong Kong.
