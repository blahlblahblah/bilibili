黄女士及其家人是如何“顺利完成进京全流程”的？当前是否存在更多的“黄女士”？这些令人疑惑的问题，有待一天之内即迅速成立的三个调查组，还公众合理合法的结论。
How did Ms Huang and her family "successfully complete the Beijing process"? Are there more "Ms Huang" at the moment? These puzzling questions await the prompt establishment of three investigation teams within a day, and the public's legitimate conclusions.
文| 王仲昀 Anne2月26日，北京发布的一例由武汉返京的确诊病例引发广泛关注。
Wang Zhongyan, a confirmed case reported in Beijing on February 26 and returned to Beijing by Wuhan, has drawn widespread attention.
根据北京市东城区新怡家园社区居委会发布的确诊病例提示，2月24日，该社区出现一名新冠肺炎确诊案例，该名女士2月22日从武汉来京，18日在武汉曾有过发热症状。
A confirmed case of New Crown Pneumonia was confirmed in the community on February 24, according to a case report issued by the Xinyi Home Community Neighbourhood Committee in Dongcheng District of Beijing.
目前3名密切接触者已被隔离。
Three close contacts have now been isolated.
随后，北京市疾控中心具体介绍了这一病例情况：黄女士，2月18日开始间断性发热5天，伴咽部不适，当时居住地为武汉。
Subsequently, Beijing CDC detailed the case: Ms. Huang, February 18 began intermittent fever for five days, with pharyngeal discomfort, then lived in Wuhan.
黄女士2月22日凌晨2：00由其北京家属自驾车到京，经体温筛查后入住其家属所在的东城区新怡家园小区。
Ms. Huang arrived in Beijing at 2: 00 am on February 22 by her Beijing family. She was screened for body temperature and moved to Xinyi's home district in Dongcheng.
2月23日19点，黄女士因发热由急救车转运至医院排查。
At 19: 00 on February 23, Ms. Wong was transferred by ambulance to the hospital for check-up due to fever.
2月24日被确认为新冠肺炎确诊病例。
Confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia were confirmed on 24 February.
相信很多人和笔者一样，看到这则新闻的第一反应是充满疑惑：离汉通道早在一个月前业已关闭。
I believe that many people like me, the first reaction to this news is full of doubts: the Han Channel was closed a month ago.
在严格管控的情况下，已经出现发热症状的黄女士，是如何自驾出武汉城，又是如何一路回到北京的？新怡家园小区北门 图源 |长安街知事系刑满释放人员，曾涉及湖北水利贪腐案件黄女士回京并被确诊的消息在网上传播后，关于她身份的讨论就此而生。
Under strict control, how did Ms. Huang, who developed fever symptoms, drive out of Wuhan and return to Beijing all the way back to BeijingThe discussion about her identity began when news that Ms. Huang, a former Hubei water conservancy corruption case, returned to Beijing and was diagnosed was spread online.
有网友称，这名黄女士系国美电器创办人黄光裕的二妹、家族二号人物黄燕虹，曾任国美集团监察中心总监等职。
A netizen said that Ms. Huang is the second sister of Gome founder Huang Guangyu and the second-in-line family member Huang Yanhong, a former Gome supervisor.
对此，湖北省监狱管理局一名工作人员对此进行了否认。
To this, a staff member of Hubei prison administration denied this.
该工作人员明确表示，从武汉回京的黄女士不叫黄燕虹，也并非原国美电器高层管理人员。
The official made it clear that Ms. Huang, who returned to Beijing from Wuhan, was not Huang Yanhong or a former Gome executive.
同时，关于黄女士到底是谁这一问题，也逐渐被披露。
At the same time, the question of who Ms. Huang really is is gradually being revealed.
26日晚播出的央视《新闻1+1》节目中，主持人白岩松提到，黄女士是刑满释放人员。
In the CCTV program "News 1 + 1" broadcast on the night of the 26th, host Bai Yansong mentioned that Ms. Huang is a released person.
根据当年的判决文书，现在能够知道，这名黄女士于1959年1月8日出生于湖北省建始县，大专文化程度，原系宣恩县水利水产局财务股副股长兼出纳，住湖北省宣恩县。
According to the sentencing documents of that year, it is now known that Ms. Huang was born on 8 January 1959 in Jianxi County, Hubei Province, and that she had a college education.
裁判文书显示，原宣恩水利水产局副局长易某富、出纳黄某英、会计夏某艳身为国家工作人员，利用职务上的便利，大肆侵吞国家财产，易某富共计贪污公款481893元，个人分得217791元；黄某英共计贪污公款721720元，个人分得365120元；夏某艳共计贪污公款353200元，个人分得176600元。
As a state functionary, he made use of his position to embezzle state property, and easily embezzled 481,893 yuan from public funds and 217,791 yuan from individuals. Huang also embezzled 721,720 yuan from public funds and 365,120 yuan from individuals.
其行为均构成贪污罪。
The act constitutes an offence of embezzlement.
2013年6月21日，湖北省宣恩县法院判决被告人黄某英犯贪污罪，判处有期徒刑十年，并处没收财产6万元。
On 21 June 2013, the Xuann County Court in Hubei Province found the defendant, Huang Meng, guilty of embezzlement and sentenced him to 10 years' imprisonment and confiscation of 60,000 yuan.
被告人黄某英不服提出上诉，恩施中院于2014年2月18日驳回上诉，维持原判。
Defendant Huang Mou-ying appealed, and on 18 February 2014, the Enshi Intermediate Court dismissed the appeal and upheld the sentence.
恩施中级法院2014年3月20日的官博也证实，恩施州宣恩县水利水产局“窝案”二审完结。
An official statement by the Enshi Intermediate Court on 20 March 2014 also confirmed the end of the second trial in the "Hostel case" of the Xuann Prefecture Water and Aquaculture Department in Enshi Prefecture.
服刑期间，黄某英两次获减刑。
While serving his sentence, Huang was twice commuted.
据湖北武汉市中级法院(2017)鄂01刑更2371号刑事裁定书显示，2017年9月黄某英获减刑7个月，2019年8月黄某英再获武汉中院裁定减刑8个月。
According to criminal ruling No. 2371 of Wuhan City Intermediate Court (2017), Huang received a seven-month reduction of his sentence in September 2017 and another eight months in August 2019 by the Wuhan Intermediate Court.
至此，其刑期自2011年4月18日起至2020年2月17日止。
His sentence thus runs from 18 April 2011 to 17 February 2020.
黄某英便是此事中的黄女士。
Huang Mou Ying is in this matter Ms. Huang.
2月27日下午，黄女士的辩护律师接受采访时表示，黄某英的原户籍在湖北宣恩县，“她在恩施人脉很广，原单位的小金库就是她管的。
In an interview on the afternoon of February 27, Ms. Huang's defense lawyer said that Huang's former domicile was in Xuann County, Hubei Province.
她家境不错，有三套房。
She has a nice family with three suites.
她的丈夫身体瘫痪后在2013年病退了，两人处于分居状态”。
Her husband was paralyzed and retired in 2013, and the two were separated.
另外，黄女士的代理律师介绍称，黄某英“在恩施被关了两年多”，2014年二审判决生效后被送到武汉女子监狱服刑。
In addition, Ms. Huang's attorney said that Huang had "been detained at Enshi for more than two years" and was sent to Wuhan women's prison to serve her sentence after the second trial came into effect in 2014.
该辩护律师表示，黄某英的女儿覃某在北京从事销售土特产的工作，这次由覃某等家属到武汉女子监狱去接黄某英回京。
The lawyer said that Ms. Huang's daughter, Morgan, was engaged in selling local products in Beijing. This time, Lhenmou's family members went to Wuhan Women's Prison to pick up Huang and return to Beijing.
看到“武汉女子监狱”，让人不难联想到几天前的新闻。
Seeing "Wuhan women's prison" is not difficult to associate with the news a few days ago.
湖北此前曾通报3所监狱发生新冠肺炎疫情，其中就有武汉女子监狱。
Hubei had previously notified three prisons of the outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia, among which Wuhan women's prison.
2月11日，该监狱为230例，2天之后，确诊数增加到279人。
On 11 February, there were 230 cases in the prison, and the number of confirmed cases increased to 279 two days later.
目前，监狱长周裕坤已被免职。
At present, prison director Zhou Yukun has been dismissed.
疑问重重，亟待厘清综合财新、新京报、红星新闻披露的一些细节，黄女士在北京入驻的小区是位于北京市崇文门商圈的新怡家园小区，北京二环边上，距离天安门直线距离不到3公里。
There are many doubts, the need to clarify the comprehensive financial disclosure, the Beijing News, the Red Star news disclosure of some details, Ms. Huang in Beijing is located in the Chongwenmen business circle of the Xinyi home small area, Beijing Second Ring Road, less than 3 kilometers away from Tiananmen Square.
该小区建成于2004-2006年，是北京南城当时为数不多的高档楼盘，位于北京繁华的崇文门商圈。
Built in 2004-2006, it was one of the few high-end buildings in Nancheng, located in the prosperous Chongwen Men business circle in Beijing.
新怡家园小区共有8栋低密度住宅楼，均为南北朝向，多为100平方米以上的户型，开盘时均价在2万元/平方米。
Xinyi homeland area in a total of eight low-density residential buildings, both North and South, most of the 100 square meters above the household type, opening at an average price of 20,000 yuan / square meters.
对此，黄女士的辩护律师表示：“她经济条件好，出事之前就给女儿在北京买了房。
"She had a good financial situation and bought her daughter a house in Beijing before the accident," Huang's lawyer said.
”26日下午，武汉女子监狱工作人员回应媒体，该监狱近期未释放犯人，目前犯人都处于留滞状态。
"Wuhan women's prison staff responded to the media on the afternoon of the 26th, the prison has not recently released prisoners, are currently in detention.
也就是说，黄女士是刑满释放人员，但是否一定是从武汉女子监狱被放出来的呢？需等待进一步官方通报的确认。
In other words, Ms. Huang is a released person, but whether must be released from Wuhan women's prison?
从武汉到北京，1000多公里，开车至少要用14个小时，2月22日凌晨2点由家属驾车从武汉接到北京的黄女士，应该是在2月21日中午12点前就从武汉出发了。
From Wuhan to Beijing, more than 1,000 kilometers, driving at least 14 hours, February 22 by family driving from Wuhan to Beijing Ms. Huang, should be before 12 noon on February 21 set out from Wuhan.
通报信息显示，2月18日，黄女士就曾经有过发烧症状，早于出发时间。
The briefing revealed that on 18 February, Ms. Huang had developed fever earlier than the departure time.
不过，家属接受媒体采访时表示，“我们被欺瞒了。
However, in an interview with the media, the family said, "We have been deceived.
”黄女士的一位亲属称，黄女士刑满释放后，他们接到监狱通知，对方要求去接人，但并未提黄女士发烧的事情。
A relative of Ms. Huang said that after her release from prison, she was informed by the prison authorities that she wanted to be taken but did not mention that she had a fever.
“我们做的事情，既是合理的，也是合法的。
"What we have done is both reasonable and lawful.
我们没有做任何过分的事情。
We didn't do anything outrageous.
” “他（监狱人士）一直让我们把人接走，但是他瞒报了监狱情况，我不知道我们接回来这多大的危险。
"" He [the prison man] kept asking us to pick him up, but he kept a lid on the prison, and I don't know how dangerous it is for us to get it back.
”在从武汉开回北京的路上，黄女士的亲属得知了武汉女子监狱发生疫情的消息。
On the way back to Beijing from Wuhan, Ms. Huang's relatives learned of the outbreak of the disease at Wuhan Women's Prison.
到北京的当天中午，家属即向社区报告，东城区疾控中心将黄女士和家属带走集中隔离，2月24日黄女士确诊新冠肺炎后，她在家中的其他家属也被带走隔离。
At noon on the day of arrival in Beijing, the family reported to the community that the CDC in Dongcheng had taken Ms. Huang and her family into intensive isolation, and that other members of her family had also been separated after Ms. Huang was diagnosed with pneumonia on 24 February.
27日下午，黄某某的女儿覃某发声：“我相信司法部会给出一个公正的调查结果。
"On the afternoon of the 27th, Huang's daughter, Morgan, utters:" I believe the Justice Department will produce an impartial investigation.
”目前真相未明，而根据业已知晓的情况，以下疑问，想必如鲠在喉，令民众不吐不快，不得不问：1. 黄女士家属回到北京后的表现，似乎挺配合。
To what extent do you agree or disagreeThe truth is not clear, and according to the known information, the following questions will be stuck in your throat and annoyance: 1.
但他们知不知道何谓“封城”？“封城”两个字最直白的含义懂吗？监狱让他们把人接走，他们就赶紧把人接走了——这可是从“武汉”接人，还一接就接到首都去了……2.2月18日，黄女士就曾经有过发烧症状，早于出发时间。
But did they know what was meant by "sealing the city"? Understand that the prison told them to take people away, they quickly picked them up - from Wuhan, and then to the capital... On February 18, Ms. Huang had a fever earlier than the departure time.
家属声称被监狱欺瞒了，不管放人的是不是武汉女子监狱，纵然狱方“未提发烧的事”，可在出发之前黄女士便有过发烧症状了，家属怎么就“忽视”了呢？纯属巧合？苦心谋划？3.如何离开武汉，又怎样回到北京，黄女士家属未做说明。
The family claims to have been deceived by the prison, regardless of whether the release of Wuhan women's prison, even if the prison "did not mention the fever," but before the departure of Ms. Huang has a fever symptoms? Purely coincidence? How to leave Wuhan, and how to return to Beijing, Ms. Huang's family did not explain.
武汉封城严防输出，北京死守滴水不漏，一路关卡重重，他们究竟何以能做到在发热的情况下“突出重围，来去自如”的？这，是最大的一个问号。
Wuhan sealed the city to prevent the export, Beijing is not leaky, all the way barriers, how can they achieve in the heat of the situation "break out of the siege, freely?" This is the biggest question mark.
4.疫情期间，武汉及湖北刑满释放人员的去留问题也因此事引起广泛关注。
4. During the epidemic period, the issue of the removal and retention of released prisoners in Wuhan and Hubei also aroused widespread concern.
若刑满释放人员不是当地的，怎么办？怎么解决其临时安置问题？5.还有没有更多“自由自在”的“黄女士”？一天之内，三个调查组成立在当前防控疫情关键时期，又是在疫情依旧严峻的武汉，为何发生这样一起事件，自然迅速成为人们非常关心的问题。
If the released prisoners are not local, how to solve the problem of their temporary resettlement? 5. Is there more "free" "Ms. Huang"? In a day, three investigation teams were set up in the current critical period of epidemic prevention and control, and in Wuhan, where the epidemic is still severe, why such an incident naturally and quickly became a matter of great concern.
换言之，在这个时间节点上，这件事不查清楚，不给公众一个明确交代，肯定不行。
In other words, at this point in time, this matter is not clear, do not give the public a clear account, certainly not.
为此，一天之内，三个调查组便迅速成立。
As a result, three investigation teams were established quickly within a day.
2月26日，经中央政法委批准，司法部牵头，由分管副部长刘志强带队，会同中央政法委、最高人民检察院、公安部组成联合调查组，赴湖北就武汉女子监狱一名刑满释放人员感染新冠肺炎到京事件进行调查。
On 26 February, with the approval of the CPPCC, the Ministry of Justice led a joint investigation team led by Deputy Minister Liu Zhiqiang, together with the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, the Supreme People's Procuratorate and the Ministry of Public Security, to Hubei for an investigation into the case of a former female prisoner in Wuhan Women's Prison.
北京市纪委市监委也于2020年2月26日成立调查组，工作重点围绕黄某某如何进京、如何进社区开展调查，核查疫情防控工作全过程是否存在漏洞。
The Beijing Municipal Disciplinary Commission also set up an investigation team on February 26, 2020, focusing on how to enter Beijing and how to enter the community to investigate whether there are loopholes in the whole process of disease prevention and control.
同样，2月26日深夜，湖北日报发布消息，针对26日网传一名刑满释放新冠肺炎确诊人员离汉抵京的有关情况，湖北省委书记应勇作出批示：在疫情防控最吃劲的关键阶段，竟发生此类严重违反离汉离鄂通道管控的事件，绝不能允许。
Similarly, late on February 26, Hubei Daily announced that, in response to the 26-day Internet rumor of the arrival in Beijing of a person convicted of new crown pneumonia, the secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee issued a directive that such a serious violation of the control of the Hubei passage should not be allowed during the most strenuous period of epidemic prevention and control.
要迅速查清事实，依纪依法严肃处理，及时回应社会关切。
We should promptly ascertain the facts, deal with them strictly according to law and promptly respond to social concerns.
此事还是否涉及其他违法违纪问题，也要彻查。
Whether the matter also involves other violations of discipline should also be thoroughly investigated.
不论涉及到谁，都要一查到底。
Whoever's involved, we need to find out.
离汉离鄂通道管控事关全国疫情防控大局，要坚持“全国一盘棋”，吸取教训，举一反三，切实把各项管控措施落到实处。
The control of the Hubei passage bears on the overall situation of national epidemic prevention and control. We should stick to the "whole country as a whole," draw lessons from it, and implement various control measures in practice.
湖北省已成立由省纪委监委牵头，省委政法委、省检察院、省公安厅、省司法厅组成的联合调查组，立即开展调查工作。
In Hubei Province, a joint investigation team composed of provincial committees on discipline and justice, provincial procuratorates, provincial public security offices and provincial judicial departments has been set up to immediately conduct investigations.
诸多令人疑惑的问题，三个调查组将还公众一个合理合法的结论。
The three investigation teams will also give the public a reasonable and legitimate conclusion to a number of questionable questions.
