Hangzhou Tower 2007-9-24 16: 23 Zhang Yue February 20, the highest unit price of Hangzhou Tower is a single watch business, turnover more than 350,000 yuan.
”“终于等到你！”这是浙江杭州奢侈品及高端购物中心“杭州大厦购物城”在其微信公号发布将恢复营业的消息后，被点赞最多的一条评论。
"Wait till you do!" was one of the comments most frequently made by Hangzhou City, Zhejiang's luxury and high-end shopping centre, after its micro-letter announcement that it would resume operations.
2月20日，因新冠肺炎疫情影响关门歇业的浙江杭州大厦购物城正式恢复营业。
On Feb. 20, Hangzhou Tower, Zhejiang Province, closed for business due to the outbreak of Newcastle Pneumonia.
从当天营业情况看，消费者终于等到商场开门的心情绝不是杜撰的。
Judging by the business conditions of the day, the mood of consumers finally waiting for the store to open was not concocted.
据杭州网报道，尽管当日营业时间缩短至12点到下午五点的五个小时，但杭州大厦全店销售额突破1100万元，超过上年同期全天从早十点到晚十点营业12小时的销售额。
Sales of Hangzhou Tower topped 11 million yuan, up from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. a year earlier, although business hours were cut to 12 to 5 p.m., Hangzhou reported.

而如果搜索这些商场的恢复营业消息推送，会发现消费者迫切想要逛街的心声充斥在相关评论区。
If you search these stores to restore business news, you will find that consumers eager to go shopping in the comments area.
一位杭州万象城购物中心的工作人员告诉界面时尚记者，自从对外公布了要恢复营业，消费者的咨询就源源不绝。
A staff member at the Hangzhou City Shopping Centre told Interface Fashion News that since the announcement of the resumption of business, consumer consultation continues.
比如，不少消费者都通过商场微信公号后台留言咨询店铺和专柜开业情况。
For example, many consumers have been through the mall micro-letter backstage message advice shop and counters opened.
据他介绍，其中询问度最高的店铺包括快时尚品牌Zara、部分美妆护肤品牌以及餐厅。
Among the most sought-after stores are fast-fashion brand Zara, some cosmetics and skincare brands and restaurants, he said.
不过，他也提到，高询问度并不等同于高人流。
However, he also mentioned that high levels of questioning did not equate with high levels of abortion.
他表示，虽然已有部分顾客到店选购，但商场整体客流量还是少，而且即使顾客来到商场，也一般目标明确，买了要买的商品就快速离开，和以前的“逛街”还是有一些区别，“毕竟现在还是非常时期，大家都会更小心，而且之前拉客的餐厅、电影院都还不能进客嘛。
Although some shoppers are already shopping, the overall flow is small, he says, and even when customers come to the mall, they tend to be very specific and leave quickly with the items they want to buy. "After all, it's still a very unusual time, and people are more careful and can't go to restaurants or cinemas before.
”杭州大厦一家奢侈鞋履品牌专柜的营业员也向记者表达了类似的观察。
The salesperson of a luxury shoe and footwear brand counter in Hangzhou House expressed a similar observation to reporters.
她说，杭州大厦线下店开业当日，她所在的专柜没有迎来进店客人。
On the opening day of the Hangzhou Tower's off-line store, she said, her counters were not welcoming in.
但她还是完成了4单业绩，全是顾客通过微信直接向她下单完成的。
However, she still completed 4 performances, all customers through micro-mail directly to her to complete the order.
她分析称，试衣服、鞋等产品需要在店铺停留时间较长，且需要有很多额外接触物品和人的机会，可能还是会影响部分消费者的选择。
Products such as clothes and shoes need to be kept in stores for longer periods of time and require lots of additional exposure to goods and people, she said, possibly affecting the choices of some consumers.
而且现在线上退换货也方便、有保障，因此消费者完全可以选择线上下单。
And now online returns are convenient, guaranteed, so consumers can choose the line up and down single.
而且实际上在疫情之前，线上购物也已经成为他们重要的营业手段。
And, in fact, before the epidemic, online shopping had become an important part of their business.
图片来源：杭州网如界面时尚此前曾报道的，收到线下商场歇业、消费者信心减少等因素的影响，不少时尚品牌开始尝试通过微信群、直播、朋友圈发图等方式展开线上销售。

Many fashion brands are trying to launch online sales through micro-groups, live broadcasts and maps of friends.
而随着线下门店开业，这些之前着重于发送产品信息的线上渠道，也开始分享关于线下门店营业情况的信息，用以联系消费者。
As offline stores opened, these online channels, which used to focus on sending product information, also began to share information about offline store operations to reach consumers.
《杭州日报》在相关报道中提到，杭州大厦一时装专柜的导购就尝试通过直播展示门店消杀情况，以希望增强消费者到线下实体店消费的信心。
In a related report, Hangzhou Daily reported that a fashion wardrobe at Hangzhou Tower tried to show off shop killings live in hopes of boosting consumer confidence in offline physical store consumption.
“我们还是要努力吸引顾客来店里看看，”上述鞋履专柜营业员说，“线下购物以货带货，做成大单子的概率肯定还是更高些。
"We still have to try to attract customers to the store," said the salesperson of the shoe and footwear counter. "The probability of making a big order is definitely higher.
”相较而言，高级腕表等硬奢侈品品牌的线下客流和销售业绩都已接近正常水平。
Hard luxury brands such as luxury watches, by contrast, have seen near-normal offline passenger and sales performance.
杭州大厦的销售人员在接受前述杭州网采访时提到，“名表价格高，顾客还是要到现场比较放心”，而表款细节前期都可以通过线上渠道沟通好，所以顾客到店付完款取好货就能离开，可以实现最短时间的停留。
Hangzhou Tower sales staff in the aforementioned interview with Hangzhou said that "high price watch, customers still need to go to the scene more secure," and the details of the table can be communicated through the online channels, so customers can pay to pick up the goods can leave, can achieve the shortest possible stay.
2月20日，杭州大厦最高客单价成交的就是一单名表生意，成交额超过35万元。
February 20, Hangzhou Tower, the highest unit price transaction is a single watch business, turnover of more than 350,000 yuan.
当然，从整体上看，尽管营业秩序正在恢复，但商场们要想回归常态仍需要一段时间。
Overall, of course, it will take some time for businesses to return to normality, despite the fact that business is returning.
一方面，大多数商场目前开业时间都较短，基本都是中午时分开门，傍晚就关店歇业。
On the one hand, most shopping malls are currently open for short periods of time, are generally open around noon and close in the evening.
同时，消费者需要提供杭州城市健康绿码，并通过体温检测方能进入店铺，或多或少会影响部分消费者出门到店的欲望。
At the same time, consumers need to provide Hangzhou city health green code, and through temperature testing can enter the store, more or less will affect the desire of some consumers to go out to the store.
除此之外，影院、餐厅等易造成人员聚集的场所也都未开放，也影响了购物中心的整体体验，使得真正的“逛街”只能打折扣展开。
In addition, cinemas, restaurants and other places where people congregate are not open, also affecting the overall experience of shopping centers, so that real "shopping" can only be discounted.
