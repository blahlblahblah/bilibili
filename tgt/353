采写/胡琪琛编辑/刘汨隔离病房贴上了福字 | 长江日报22岁的黎平安是武汉一家三级医院的医生，在市内公共交通停止运行后，大年三十那天，他走了一个多小时去医院上班。
Now he has worked as a doctor at a level III hospital in Wuhan. He has walked more than an hour to the hospital on the thirtieth day after the city's public transport service stopped.
在黎平安工作的医院，同样面临着物资匮乏的情况，一套本该一人使用的防护设备，被分给了几名医护人员共同使用，护士长不断提醒，“省着点，春节后可能就不够了”。
The hospital, where Li Ping works, also faces shortages. A set of protective equipment meant for one person was shared among several medical staff, and the head nurse repeatedly warned, "Save some money, maybe not enough after the Spring Festival."
黎平安也很担心父亲，父亲是一家区级医院的呼吸科主任，一天接诊了100多名病人，唯一的防护是一层口罩。
Li also worried about his father, who was the respiratory director of a district hospital and attended to more than 100 patients a day, the only protection being a mask.
以下是黎平安的自述。
The following is a self-report by Li Ping.
大年三十，去支援发热门诊高考填志愿，我想学医。
Year 30, to support the fever clinic college entrance examination fill in volunteers, I want to study medicine.
可没想到我父亲，一个区级中心医院的呼吸科主任，是最坚决反对的那个人。
But my father, the respiratory director of a district-level central hospital, was the most adamant opponent.
要知道，我可是在医院里长大的。
You know, I grew up in a hospital.
我父亲是医生，我母亲是医院职工，我就住在医院的家属楼里，从小就是满眼的白大褂。
My father is a doctor, my mother is a hospital staff, I live in the family building of the hospital, from childhood is full of white coats.
我觉得这工作特别神圣，但我爸认为医生太辛苦、医患关系也不好，最后折中，我学了检验专业，毕业后也分到了医院的检验科。
I thought the job was especially sacred, but my dad thought the doctor was too hard-working and the doctor-patient relationship was bad.
今年1月中旬，我接到通知，说发热门诊人手不够，急需检验科支援，要求全科人员在武汉待命，24小时手机开机，一旦有需要，立刻赶往科室。
In mid-January this year, I was informed that the fever clinic was understaffed and needed urgent laboratory support. I asked the general practitioner to stand by in Wuhan for 24-hour mobile phone start-up.
我们科室一位医生写了一封178个字的请战书，“要求领导给我额外排班，要求不计报酬，克服家庭一切困难，投入到这次抗击病毒的战斗中“。
A doctor in our department wrote a 178-word letter of request, "asking my leaders to schedule extra classes for me, to be reckless, to overcome all the difficulties of my family, and to devote myself to this fight against the virus."
之后，这封信在我的朋友圈里疯转。
After that, the letter went crazy in my circle of friends.
1月18日，根据大家的意愿、时间、能力，医院迅速出了一份排班表。
On 18 January, in accordance with the wishes, time and capacity of all, the hospital quickly drew up a schedule.
我的班，正好被排在了大年三十这天。
My class, just scheduled to be on the thirtieth day of the New Year.
看到消息，我给父亲打了个电话，告诉他今年过年回不来了。
Seeing the news, I called my father and told him that he would not be back this New Year.
我俩上次通话还是在小年夜那天，他们科室聚餐，他酒喝多了，一直问我，春节排班出来了吗，什么时候回家。
The last time we spoke to each other, they had dinner in their office. He drank too much and kept asking me if the Spring Festival was coming out and when he would be home.
疫情出现以后，父亲已经在一线门诊工作了好几天。
Since the outbreak, my father has been working in front-line clinics for several days.
电话里，他语言挺平静的，只是反复强调要注意防护，我也提醒他，一定要保护好自己。
On the phone, his language is quite calm, but repeatedly stressed the need to pay attention to the protection, I reminded him, must protect themselves.
医生在防护服背后写上自己的名字检测科也确诊不了新型肺炎1月24日，大年三十早上6点多，因为武汉的公共交通已经停止，我也没车，花了1个小时10分钟，从家走到了医院。
The doctor wrote his name on the back of the suit and the doctor could not confirm the new type of pneumonia on Jan. 24, about 6 am, because the public transportation in Wuhan had stopped and I didn't have a car. It took me an hour and 10 minutes to walk from my home to the hospital.
7点半到科室时，一位年龄较大的前辈还没有结束夜班，但见我来了，问我“怎么来的？”我如实作答，他笑着给我比了一个大拇指。
When I arrived at the desk at 7: 30, an older senior had not finished the night shift, but seeing me come, I asked "how?" I answered truthfully, smiling and giving me a thumbs-up.
我在发热门诊，主要负责为一线病人采集检测样本，比如采血、咽试纸、尿液标本等。
I am in the fever clinic, mainly responsible for the first-line patients to collect test samples, such as blood collection, pharyngeal paper, urine samples.
样本采集完成后会被送到检测室，放到生物安全柜里进行检测。
After the sample is collected, it will be sent to the testing room and put into the bio-safety cabinet for testing.
很多患者乃至医生会给我们打电话，问我们能不能检查出这次新型的冠状病毒。
A lot of patients and even doctors will call us and ask if we can detect this new coronavirus.
我们只能遗憾地告诉他们，检测科也无法确诊。
We can only regret to tell them that the test unit was unable to confirm the diagnosis.
我们能做的检测都是常规项目，比如血常规、C反应蛋白、呼吸道五联、病毒全套等等，但做不了冠状病毒核酸检测。
The tests we can do are routine items like routine blood test, C-reactive protein, respiratory tract pentavalent, virus complete and so on, but we cannot do coronavirus nucleic acid test.
其实试剂盒研制出后，我们科室的主任就联系到了一批。
In fact, when the kit was developed, the director of our department was connected to a batch.
但1月20日，国家卫健委又发布公告，将新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎规定为乙类传染病，并采取甲类传染病的预防、控制措施。
However, on January 20, the National Fitness and Health Commission issued a notice, the new coronavirus infection of pneumonia as a B-infectious disease, and to take measures to prevent and control Class A infectious diseases.
甲类传染病的检测必须在三级实验室开展。
The detection of Class A infectious diseases must be carried out in a level III laboratory.
医院的生物实验室一般都是二级生物实验室，是没有资格开展检测的。
The biological laboratories in hospitals are generally secondary biological laboratories and are not eligible for testing.
到现在，我也没见过这个试剂盒长什么样。
I haven't seen the kit so far.
现在医院能做的，就是用排除法，找出“高度疑似”病例。
Now the hospital can do is to use the method of removal, to find "highly suspected" cases.
如果患者出现高度类似新型肺炎的症状，检测结果排除了所有常规原因，再结合医生的临床判断，最多只能确认为高度疑似病例。
If the patient presents symptoms that are highly similar to those of the new type of pneumonia, the test results exclude all routine causes and, combined with the clinician's judgement, can only be identified as highly suspicious cases at best.
这些高度疑似病例会交由医院里面一些高层次的专家进行会诊，再由他们共同提出申请，去疾控中心做确诊。
These highly suspected cases are referred to high-level specialists at the hospital, who then jointly apply to the CDC for a diagnosis.
最后的结果，要两级权威的疾控中心确认后，才算是真正确诊。
The final results, two levels of authority of the CDC after confirmation, is a true diagnosis.
省下一层防护衣，留给流动护士和医生、护士相比，我的工作环境算好的。
Save a layer of protective clothing and leave the ambulatory nurse with a much better working environment than the doctor or nurse.
我在自己的房间里，通过一个半开的玻璃窗口接触病人，相当于在一个半密闭的环境内工作。
I was in my own room, working in a semi-enclosed environment, touching the patient through a half-open window.
医生、护士不一样，他们需要完全接触患者，危险系数更高，特别是有的护士，还要给病人喂饭、大小解。
Doctors and nurses, on the other hand, need to be fully exposed to the patient and have a higher risk factor, especially if they are nurses.
我们每天工作的第一件事是穿戴防护设备。
The first thing we do every day is to wear protective equipment.
在科室穿好白大褂后，前往发热门诊，之后依次洗手，戴N95口罩、头套和第一层橡胶手套。
After the white coats, go to the fever clinic and wash your hands in turn, wearing a N95 mask, a hood and a first layer of rubber gloves.
然后用手套包裹住白大褂袖口，扎紧封闭，再用免洗手消毒液进行第一次消毒，为穿防护服做准备。
Then use gloves wrapped around the white coat cuffs, tight closure, and then wash-free disinfectant for the first time disinfection, ready to wear protective clothing.
按理说，我们应在防护服里再穿一层隔离衣。
Logically, we should put on another layer of protective clothing.
但现在物资匮乏，我们只能把防护服和隔离衣分开使用。
But now we are short of supplies, we can only use the protective clothing and the isolation clothing separately.
直接接触一线的医生就穿安全等级更高的防护服，将隔离衣留给非一线的流动护士。
Doctors in direct contact wear protective clothing of a higher security level, leaving the protective clothing to non-first-line ambulatory nurses.
护士长特意嘱咐，让大家省着用防护装备，说春节期间供应暂时还够，但是春节之后就比较悬了。
The head nurse specifically asked us to save the use of protective equipment, saying that the supply during the Spring Festival is still enough, but the Spring Festival after the relatively hanging.
现在我们小组里面所有人都在联系外省的朋友，甚至国外的朋友，看能不能筹措到一些装备，就供自己组用。
Now everyone in our group is contacting friends in the provinces and even abroad to see if we can raise some equipment for our own group.
防护服穿戴好之后，再是鞋套，第二次免洗手消毒，第二层塑胶手套，最后是防护面罩。
Wear protective clothing, then shoe cover, a second wash-free disinfection, a second layer of plastic gloves, and finally a protective mask.
这套设备一天穿下来，总觉得呼吸困难，又闷又热。
This set of equipment is worn down day by day, always feel breathless, stuffy and hot.
而且这防护服都是一次性连体的，脱下来就报废了。
And this protective clothing is disposable, take off on scrap.
一整天下来，我们一口水都不敢喝，一趟厕所也不敢上，生怕浪费了一件防护服。
At the end of the day, we dared not drink a mouthful of water or go to the toilet for fear of wasting a protective suit.
双层厚橡胶手套也很影响工作。
Double-ply heavy rubber gloves also affect work.
平常我们采血就戴一层手套，病人的血管难找的时候，有时根本不戴手套。
Usually we wear a glove when we collect blood, and sometimes we don't wear gloves when blood vessels are difficult to find.
但这次我们必须带厚厚的双层手套，影响摸血管的手感。
But this time we have to wear a thick double glove that affects the feel of the blood vessels.
24日我给第一个病人采血，找血管用了足足半分钟，才敢给他下针。
I took blood from the first patient on the 24th. It took half a minute to find a blood vessel before I dared to give him an injection.
最难受的是防护面罩和口罩。
The hardest part was the face mask and mask.
我们呼吸时，热气是往上走的，遇到冷冰冰的防护面罩会凝结成了一层层水雾。
When we breathe, the heat goes up, and the cold visor condenses into layers of mist.
因为手不干净，这些水雾又无法进行擦拭，导致我给病人抽血时，需要上下找角度，通过折射去找血管。
Because the hands are not clean, these mist can not be wiped, leading me to the patient when the blood, need to look up and down, through refraction to find blood vessels.
一天下来，我的口罩内层全部打湿，水涔涔地往脖子下面灌。
At the end of the day, my mask is moist and under my neck.
每天我做完最后一个检测时，身心都觉得如释重负。
Every day when I finished my last test, I felt relieved.
特别是防护服脱下来那一刻，感觉整个世界都被打开了。
Especially when the suit came off, it felt like the whole world was open.
医院里送来的匿名外卖不管在进入一线之前有多担心，穿上防护装备的那一刻，你都会迅速进入工作状态，暂时忘却恐惧。
Anonymous takeaway from the hospital No matter how worried you are before you go into the front line, the moment you put on your protective gear, you will quickly move into work, temporarily forgetting your fears.
大年三十那天，我从早上8点工作到中午12:30，短暂的午餐后，又继续工作到下午的5点。
On New Year's Eve, I worked from 8 a.m. to 12.30 p.m., and after a short lunch, I continued to work until 5 p. m.
一天下来，我接触了30个左右病人，临床医生那边得有60多个病人。
By the end of the day, I was in contact with about 30 patients, and the clinician had to have more than 60 patients.
前些天我们医院两个院区加起来，一天能接诊四五百人。
A few days ago our hospital two courtyard area adds up, can accept four or five hundred people a day.
一位上夜班的同事，看到凌晨4点半的窗外，排着一条人头攒动的长队。
A late-night colleague saw a long line swarming through the 4: 30 a. m. window.
来做检查的病人，每位都神色严峻，每个人都怕自己真的感染上了病毒。
Each of the patients who came to the examination looked grim, and everyone was afraid that they were really infected with the virus.
我个人的感受是，这个时候医患关系比平时也好了许多。
My personal feeling is that the doctor-patient relationship at this time is much better than usual.
昨天我给一个29岁的男性患者抽血时，我的前针已经扎进去了，正准备加真空管时，双层手套直接把针从血管里带了出来，他的胳膊立刻血流不止，我都惊了，连忙道歉说，不好意思，不好意思。
Yesterday, when I took a blood sample from a 29-year-old male patient, my forehand was already stuck in and I was about to add a vacuum tube. The double glove pulled the needle directly out of his veins.
他比我还客气，一直说不要紧不要紧，你穿那么多衣服，也不好作业，我们都理解，你们现在都辛苦。
He was more courteous than me, always saying it doesn't matter, you wear so many clothes, it's not easy to do your homework, we all understand, you all work hard now.
我马上给他进行紧急处理，消毒，按压止血。
I'm gonna give him an emergency treatment, disinfect it, put pressure on the bleeding.
他按了一下流血处就立刻换了另一手，还跟我解释说，刚刚那个手的血管可能没有那么好了，换这个抽。
He pressed the bleeding spot and immediately changed hands. He explained to me that the blood vessels in the hand just now might not be that good.
昨天父亲告诉我，有天早上7点左右，他们医院的急诊科收到了一名爱心人士送来的匿名外卖，里面是一些早茶早点，还附了一张纸条，“希望能让那些忙碌了一宿的白衣天使们，吃上一口热乎乎的早茶”。
Yesterday my father told me that one morning at about 7 a.m., the emergency department of their hospital had received an anonymous takeaway from a loving person, containing some morning tea breakfast and a note saying, "I hope those white angels who have been busy all night will have a hot morning tea."
一批物资运抵黎平安所在的医院我把女朋友骂了一顿我们医院有两个分院，我在两个分院之间租了一个小房。
I gave my girlfriend a piece of my mind. Our hospital has two branches, and I rented a small room between the two branches.
之前我和女朋友两个人住，因为女朋友要回家做伴娘，在武汉关闭交通出口的前两天回了洪湖。
I used to live with my girlfriend because my girlfriend had to go home to work as a maid of honor and return to Honghu two days before Wuhan closed the traffic exit.
现在家里只有我一个人。
I'm all alone in the house now.
除夕晚上回家有些晚，我懒得做饭，打开外卖一看还有店开着，就点了一份黄焖鸡米饭。
On New Year's Eve, when I came home late, I didn't bother to cook, opened the takeaway and ordered a stew of chicken rice.
外卖到的时候，差不多是八点。
It was about eight o'clock when we took it out.
春晚本来有个和疫情有关的特别节目，说武汉是在保护全国人民，当时我挺感动。
Spring Festival Gala had a special program related to the epidemic, saying that Wuhan is protecting the people of the country, I was very moved.
但是越看到后来，越觉得落寞。
But the more I saw it, the more lonely I felt.
春晚载歌载舞，但热闹都是别人的，我们这边像是什么都没有。
Chunwan singing and dancing, but lively are all other people's, we seem to have nothing here.
我有一个很庞大的家族。
I have a very large family.
父亲有四个哥哥和两个姐姐。
Father has four brothers and two sisters.
每年初一，就会全部回到老家，之前爷爷奶奶还在的时候，家里最多是五代同堂。
On the first day of every year, we will all go back to our hometown. Before, our grandparents were still there.
这事之后，我在深圳的大伯没有回家，二伯跟家家户户说，今年取消拜年了，就在电话里给大家祝福，等这事过去后，再一起聚一个团圆年。
After this incident, my uncle in Shenzhen did not return home, the second uncle told every family, this year cancelled the New Year call, on the phone to bless everyone, after this matter, and then together a round year.
昨天堂哥问我，是不是一个人在武汉，有没有回家。
Yesterday my cousin asked me if I was alone in Wuhan and had not returned home.
我说，没回家。
I said, not coming home.
他说，那你来我家来住。
he said. Then come and live in my house.
我想都没想马上回绝了。
I didn't even think of turning it down right away.
我怕如果自己真的感染了，很可能会传染给他们。
I'm afraid if I do get the infection, I'm likely to infect them.
其实，医务工作者都有自我隔离的自觉。
In fact, medical workers have self-isolation conscious.
我有个同事，很早就把孩子送到爷爷奶奶家。
I had a colleague who sent the baby to his grandparents' house early.
比起思念与牵挂，他们更担心会感染孩子。
They worry more about infecting their children than they do about missing or worrying about them.
再比如武汉市民自发建群，说是要送医生上下班，但我们科室没有一个人去联系市民坐车，每个人都害怕无意将病毒感染更多的人。
In Wuhan, for example, people spontaneously set up groups, to send doctors to and from work, but no one in our department to contact the citizens to take the bus, everyone is afraid of inadvertently infecting more people.
昨天，我就是因为隔离这件事跟女朋友吵了架。
Yesterday, I had a fight with my girlfriend over segregation.
女朋友回老家后，一直不停地给我转发新闻，不停地嘱咐我，家里要通风，要多喝热水，要好好吃饭，要好好照顾自己。
When my girlfriend came back to my hometown, she kept relaying news to me, telling me to keep the house well ventilated, drink more hot water, eat well and take good care of myself.
结果晚上睡觉前，她突然跟我说，现在紧急物资匮乏，如果有机会想回武汉做志愿者，同时也陪陪我。
As a result, before going to bed at night, she suddenly told me that emergency supplies are scarce, if the opportunity to return to Wuhan as a volunteer, but also accompany me.
我狠狠骂了她一顿。
I gave her a good scolding.
我说了好久这边什么都好，不用担心的狠话，她才同意不回来。
I said a long time here everything is good, do not worry about the cruel words, she agreed not to come back.
父亲只戴着一层口罩坐诊除夕夜，我和父亲的电话，仍旧没有超过三分钟。
My father sat with a mask on New Year's Eve, and my father and I did not call for more than three minutes.
一下班，我就给他打了电话。
As soon as I got off work, I called him.
他说医院还在开会，马上匆匆挂了电话。
He said the hospital was still in session and hung up the phone immediately.
父亲所在的是区里最好的医院，辖区有一百万人，平时去看病的人就很多，现在也一定不比市里的医院少。
His father was in the best hospital in the district, with a million people in his district, and there were many people who went to see him on a regular basis, and there must be no less hospitals in the city.
除夕那天，父亲在呼吸科门诊坐诊，一天看了140多个病人。
On New Year's Eve, my father attended a respiratory clinic and saw more than 140 patients a day.
相对市里的医院，区医院的防护物资更加匮乏。
Relative to the city's hospitals, the district hospitals are even less well supplied with protective materials.
父亲坐诊时是没有防护服的，我一直跟他说要穿，但是每家医院都是一样，在物资匮乏的情况下，优先保障发热门诊的一线医生。
My father did not wear protective clothing when he was in hospital, and I kept telling him to wear it, but every hospital was the same, giving priority to front-line doctors at the fever clinic in case of shortages.
我问他，没有防护服，你们戴护目镜了吗？他说，其实也没有，他就戴着一层薄薄的口罩。
'I asked him, 'Did you wear goggles without protective clothing? Not really,' he said. 'He was wearing a thin mask.
一想到最近有很多新增病例其实并没有发热症状，我愈发担心他。
I am all the more worried about him at the thought of the many new cases that have recently occurred without febrile symptoms.
在春晚刚开始前五分钟，我又给母亲打了个电话。
Five minutes before the Spring Festival Gala began, I called my mother again.
母亲告诉我，父亲已经到家了，正准备换衣服洗澡，还没吃饭。
My mother told me that my father had arrived home and was getting ready to change his clothes and take a bath.
。
.
听到他已经回来，我才心安了些。
I was relieved to hear that he had returned.
之后我没再给父亲打电话，只是在微信上彼此嘱咐对方，要保护好自己。
Then I didn't call my father again. I just told each other on the microphone to protect myself.
