虽身份若干，但他坚守企业家这个根本，做务实的行动派“不要认为慈善家就是捐多少钱，捐钱很重要但不是根本，根本就是把企业做好”“武大校友”“92派”，这是陈东升在泰康保险集团董事长之外最醒目的两个标签。
"Don't think philanthropists are donating as much money. Donating money is important, but not essential." "Wu Da alumni" and "92 faction" are the two most visible labels Chen Dongsheng holds in addition to the chairman of Taikang Insurance Group
作为恢复高考之初的79级大学生，他是武大校友总会执行会长、众人口中的“武大好师兄”；“92派”是他自创的概念，用以概括邓小平南方谈话之后的下海知识分子，也早已成为公认的历史名词。
As a 79-year-old college student at the beginning of the college entrance examination, he was the executive president of Wu Da-shu, and the so-called "Wu Da-shu"; "92" was his original concept, used to summarize the lower-sea intellectuals after Deng Xiaoping's Southern Conversation, and has long been accepted as a historical term.
“我们这代人,是毛泽东的好孩子，邓小平的好学生”，这是他前半生的夫子自道。
"Our generation, Mao Zedong's good children, Deng Xiaoping's good students," this is his first half of life self-taught.
如今的他奉行中庸之道，“我的政治观是不左不右不高调，我的社会取向是为家、为家乡、为母校、为社会”。
Today he pursues a middle way, "my political outlook is not left right high-profile, my social orientation is home, for home, alma mater, and society."
无论哪一重身份，他都努力经营，信奉时间就是答案。
No matter what his status, he is hard-working, believe in time is the answer.
疫情风暴来临时，63岁的他指挥调度校友资源为湖北捐钱捐物；率先垂范为“人民战争”尽民企所能；通过拍下艺术品，为妻子孔冬梅的东润基金会筹款，救助医护群体……耳顺之年已过，虽然身份若干但他守住企业家这个根本，做务实的行动派。
When the storm hit, the 63-year-old directed Dispatch Alumni Resources to donate money and goods to Hubei. He led a private enterprise in the "People's War." He helped the medical community by filming art and raising money for his wife, the Dongrun Foundation.
风云突变2019年12月20日，武汉东湖国际会议中心，第四届楚商大会开幕。
Mutations of wind and clouds December 20, 2019, Wuhan Donghu International Convention Center, the fourth Chu Shang Congress opened.
马云从湖北省省长手中接过大红的聘书，受邀担任湖北省人民政府经济发展顾问。
Ma received Dahong's offer from the governor of Hubei province and was invited to serve as an economic development adviser to Hubei province's government.
上台发言时，马云说起前一天在武大听来的故事：宁波商人沈祝山宁可倾家荡产，也要保障武大的校舍建设。
Speaking on the stage, Ma spoke of the story heard the day before at Wu Da: Ningbo businessman Shen Zhu Shan would rather ruin his family, but also to guarantee the construction of Wu Da's school building.
他认为，这就是武大企业家精神的传承。
He thinks, this is the inheritance of Wu Da entrepreneur spirit.
一个小故事巧妙地连接起浙商与楚商、过去和未来，宾主两欢。
A small story cleverly connected Zhejiang merchants and Chu merchants, past and future, the guests two Huanhuan.
能请动浙商总会会长马云“跨界”参加楚商商会，这个面子不小。
Please move Zhejiang Association President Ma Yun "cross-border" to participate in the Chu Chamber of Commerce, this face is not small.
请来马云的，就是陈东升，他俩共同被聘为湖北省经济发展顾问。
Ma Yun-sheng, Chen Dongsheng, was hired as an economic development consultant in Hubei Province.
无论年龄还是资历，年长7岁的陈东升可算是马云的大哥——1993年陈东升创办嘉德拍卖时，马云还在经营自己的翻译社。
Regardless of age or seniority, Chen Dongsheng, seven years older, was Ma's elder brother - he was running his own translation agency when he founded Cad's auction in 1993.
作为楚商领袖、武大校友，陈东升已不是第一次为家乡带来重量级资源，他说自己这些年一直活跃在湖北政治经济的舞台。
As the leader of Chu Shang and an alumnus of Wu University, Chen Dongsheng has not brought heavyweight resources to his hometown for the first time.
12月20日，是他最近一次现身武汉。
On December 20th, he was last seen in Wuhan.
几周之后，这座城市成为全国乃至全球关注的焦点。
A few weeks later, the city became the focus of national and global attention.
2019年的最后一天，陈东升给泰康人寿湖北分公司总经理李勇转发了一条新闻链接，并叮嘱他“关注”，因为报道中称武汉出现“不明原因肺炎”。
On the last day of 2019, Mr. Chen forwarded a news link to Li Yong, general manager of Hubei branch of Taikang Life, advising him to "pay attention" to reports of "unexplained pneumonia" in Wuhan.
此前，陈东升已陆续看到相关信息，隐约觉得有些不安。
Earlier, Chen Dongsheng has been seeing the relevant information, vaguely feel a bit uneasy.
倒推回去，新年前后的那些天，正是新冠肺炎疫情最扑朔迷离的一段时间。
Back, the days before and after the New Year were the most tumultuous period of New Year's Eve.
1月9日，国务院副总理、全国老龄委主任孙春兰在北京调研，强调要深入推进医养康养结合，不断满足老年人健康养老需求。
On January 9, Sun Chunlan, Vice Premier of the State Council and head of the National Old Age Commission, made a study in Beijing, stressing the need to further promote the integration of medical care and health care to meet the needs of elderly people.
在位于北京昌平区的泰康之家燕园，陈东升向孙春兰介绍了泰康的养老社区、医养产业，并提到即将在武汉开业一家医院。
In Yanyuan, a Taicang family in Changping District of Beijing, Chen Dongsheng introduced Sun Chunlan to Sun Chunlan about Taicang's old-age community and medical industry, and mentioned the upcoming opening of a hospital in Wuhan.
没想到，这次会见竟为一个月后的“捐医院”埋下伏笔。
Unexpectedly, this meeting actually set the stage for the "donation hospital" a month later.
春节临近，1月20日，蹇宏受陈东升委托去给武汉大学的一些院士、教授拜年。
The Spring Festival approaching, January 20, Chen Dongsheng commissioned by the commission to Wuhan University some academicians, professors pay a New Year call.
一位从事生命科学的院士告诉他：“从常识上讲，这种传染病不可能不人传人。
One academician in the life sciences told him: "Common sense says the epidemic cannot be passed from person to person.
你们一定要注意，情况比想象的严重得多。
You must be aware that the situation is much more serious than you think.
”当天下午，蹇宏把这一消息汇报给陈东升。
That afternoon, without the support, I informed Chen Dongsheng of the news.
当晚，钟南山院士在《新闻联播》节目中称，新冠肺炎病毒存在“人传人”。
That evening, academician Zhong Nan Shan said in the newscast program that there was "human-to-human transmission" of the new crown pneumonia virus.
蹇宏是武汉大学校友企业家联谊会和湖北省楚商联合会的秘书长，陈东升是这两家商会的会长。
Jia Hongis is the general secretary of Wuhan University Alumni Association and Hubei Chu Chamber of Commerce, and Chen Dongsheng is the president of both chambers.
1月21日，陈东升指示蹇宏在武汉成立了疫情防控指挥部，这在当地民间社团中绝无仅有。
On January 21, Epidemic Command was established in Wuhan, one of the few civil society organizations in the region.
“当时有些人认为我们是大惊小怪，用武汉话讲叫‘吓（hè）死人’，好像天大的事发生了。
"Some people at the time thought we were making a fuss, calling us' scared (hè) dead 'in Wuhan, as if something big had happened.
事实证明，比天还大的事发生了。
It turned out that something bigger than the day had happened.
”同一天，陈东升致电武汉市政府领导，表示将为抗击疫情捐赠1000万元，并为武汉医护人员赠送保险，第二天通过生态链企业紧急调集5万只口罩捐赠到武汉，“当时还判断不了这次疫情风险到达的程度，也不知道捐多少合适。
Chen Dongsheng telephoned Wuhan city government on the same day, saying he would donate 10 million yuan to fight the outbreak and give insurance to Wuhan medical staff. The next day, 50,000 masks were urgently donated to Wuhan through eco-chain enterprises.
”而此时，疫情局势仍不明朗，国家总动员尚未开始。
"This comes at a time when the situation remains uncertain and national mobilization has not yet begun.
如此迅速的反应，让泰康成为疫情发生后第一家捐钱捐保险捐口罩的民营企业。
Such a quick response made Taicang the first private company to donate money for the donation of masks after the outbreak.
“危难当头，一切不想”庚子鼠年正月初一，陈东升按原计划赴美探亲，来去六天。
"Distress in the head, all do not want" Gengzi Year of the Rat on the first day of the first month, Chen Dongsheng as originally planned to visit the United States, six days.
即便在纽约，他每天也只能睡四五个小时，大部分时间被疫情救援占据。
Even in New York City, he slept only four or five hours a day, most of the time occupied by the epidemic.
在回来的飞机上，他第一次使用了机上互联网，并部署了一系列大动作：追加捐赠2000万元、设立一亿元公众卫生和流行病防治基金、推出“爱心保”公益保险计划。
On his return flight, he used the Internet for the first time and deployed a series of major initiatives: an additional donation of $20 million, the establishment of a $100 million public health and epidemic prevention fund, and the introduction of a "love guarantee" public health insurance scheme.
第一时间做出反应，捐款捐物捐保险、设立专项基金……这些已足可称道，但如果只是这些，仍不过是一个大企业家的常规动作。
An immediate response, donations, insurance, and a special fund... are commendable, but if they are all that, they are still the norm for a big entrepreneur.
陈东升手里还有一副“王牌”，一家尚未开业的大型医院。
Chen also has a "trump card" in his hand, a large hospital that has yet to open.
泰康同济（武汉）医院是泰康保险集团投资近40亿元建设的综合三甲医院，原计划在3月底“世界大健康博览会”期间开业。
The Taikang Tongji (Wuhan) Hospital, an integrated triple-A hospital built by Taikang Insurance Group with an investment of nearly 4 billion yuan, was scheduled to open at the end of March during the World Health Expo.
保险、资管、医养是泰康鼎足而三的核心业务，按照陈东升“东西南北中”的医疗产业布局，泰康同济（武汉）医院是落子中部地区的关键棋局。
Insurance, management and medical care are the core business of Taicang, according to Chen Dongsheng "east, west, north, south-central" medical industry layout, Taikang Tongji (Wuhan) Hospital is a key chess game in the central area of Lok Tzu.
疫情之下，武汉骤然紧缺的医疗资源让他审时度势重新布局。
Under the epidemic situation, Wuhan suddenly scarce medical resources let him review the situation re-layout.
2月2日，陈东升向武汉政府递了请战书，希望将医院提前开业，为疫情救治提供火线支援。
On February 2, Chen Dongsheng sent a letter of application to the Wuhan government, hoping to open the hospital ahead of schedule to provide fire support for the epidemic.
“投资近40亿现成的医院在那儿，如果继续去造新医院不就是舍近求远吗？所以我们很着急。
"With nearly four billion ready-made hospitals there, wouldn't it be a leap in the dark to go on building new ones?
”对于正在为医院发愁的武汉市领导而言，这无疑是雪中送炭，很快市里就有人来考察。
For Wuhan, which is worrying about hospitals, this is no doubt a blessing in disguise, and soon the city will be visited.
但集团内部有不同声音，认为条件不成熟：证照不齐，接诊条件不充分，氧气、通风等硬件设施不到位。
However, there are different voices within the group that the conditions are not ripe: incomplete documentation, inadequate access to treatment, inadequate physical facilities such as oxygen, ventilation, etc.
如果启用，医院的硬件需要进行大量改造以满足接收新冠肺炎患者的条件。
If activated, the hospital's hardware would need to be substantially modified to meet the conditions for receiving patients with Newcrown Pneumonia.
短期使用后还要再恢复成原样，预计额外成本投入不少于一个亿。
Short-term use will have to be restored to its original form, with an estimated additional cost of not less than $100 million.
此外，一旦接收新冠肺炎患者，意味着医院成为传染病定点医院，即使疫情过去也无法预知会给医院未来的正常运营带来多少影响。
Moreover, once a person with pneumonia is admitted, a hospital becomes a designated hospital for infectious diseases, and even an outbreak in the past could not have foreseen how much impact it would have on the hospital's future operations.
“危难当头，一切不想”，这是陈东升最近常说的一句话，意思是眼下不要去计算任何成本、得失。
"Danger, all do not want," Chen Dongsheng recently often said that the meaning of the current do not calculate any costs, gains and losses.
“这笔账算都不要算，就到董事长这拉倒。
"Don't even count this out," the chairman said.
”2月6日晚，陈东升拍板，不惜一切代价、举集团之力支持泰康同济（武汉）医院。
On the night of February 6, Chen Dongsheng clapped his hand at all costs and with the support of the group in support of the Taikang Tongji (Wuhan) Hospital.
当晚11点，医院全员召开线上会议，200多人报名请战，最终选出了60人的突击队投入战斗。
At 11 p. m. the hospital opened an online meeting with more than 200 people who signed up to fight and eventually selected a 60-strong commando unit to fight.
2月7日，北京与武汉两地连线举行出征仪式，陈东升握拳誓师：“为我们英雄的城市，英雄的医院，勇士出征！”从决策到实施，还要迈过装修、改造的巨大门槛，报上来的工期是一个月。
On February 7, 2007, Beijing and Wuhan connection held a war ceremony, Chen Dongsheng clenched fists: "For our hero of the city, the hospital of heroes, warriors out!" From decision-making to implementation, there is still a huge renovation, renovation of the threshold, reported a period of one month.
“鬼扯！一个月疫情都要过去了，提都别提了。
"Nonsense! The epidemic is over for a month. Don't mention it.
”陈东升说。
"said Chen.
从一个月到20天再到一周，最后的整体改建包括设计、审核、施工在内只有三天三夜。
From a month to 20 days to a week, the final overall renovation, including design, audit, construction, only three days and three nights.
2月11日，国务院副总理孙春兰来到泰康同济（武汉）医院考察，对泰康医院主动投身到抗疫中表示感谢。
On February 11, Vice Premier Sun Chunlan visited Taicang Tongji (Wuhan) Hospital and expressed his gratitude to Taikang Hospital for its active participation in the fight against the disease.
2月13日，泰康同济（武汉）医院被正式确定为参照武汉火神山医院运行模式，由军队支援，承担确诊患者医疗救治任务。
February 13, Taikang Tongji (Wuhan) Hospital was officially established as a reference Wuhan Huoshen Mountain Hospital operating model, supported by the military, undertake the task of diagnosis of patients medical treatment.
同日，湖北省卫健委核发医疗机构执业许可证，医院性质为非政府办非营利性医疗机构。
On the same day, Hubei Wei Jiancommittee issued medical practice license, the hospital nature of non-governmental non-profit medical institutions.
这意味着，这家原本定位为营利性医疗机构的医院，彻底改变了营业性质。
This meant that the hospital, originally designated as a for-profit medical institution, radically changed the nature of its operations.
“想过很多种隆重开业的样子，谁曾想到泰康同济这艘医疗航母，会在如此惊涛骇浪之下，拨开笼罩这座城市的阴霾，以这样勇敢的姿态投入战斗！”该院执行院长肖骏说。
"Who would have thought that the medical carrier, Tai Hong Tongji, would go into battle in such a brave manner through the gloom that envelops the city in such a stormy sea," said Xiao Jun, executive dean of the hospital.
就这样，一家筹备三年之久的民营医院变身“战地医院”、“人民医院”。
In this way, a three-year-old private hospital into a "field hospital," "people's hospital."
它是军队在武汉支援的三家医院之一，截至3月12日已累计收治确诊患者1619名，成为武汉抗疫战场上的主力舰之一。
As of March 12, 1,619 patients had been admitted to Wuhan as one of the three hospitals supported by the army in Wuhan.
带头大哥医院开业前的那段时间，陈东升很着急，多次表示要到武汉去，但都被工作人员劝阻了。
Leading Big Brother Hospital before the opening of the time, Chen Dongsheng very anxious, repeatedly expressed to Wuhan, but staff have been discouraged.
“现在这个时候，吃饭、住宿都成问题，我们也没办法陪你，来了还回不去。
"At this time, meals, accommodation are problematic, we can not accompany you, come back can not return.
” 前线总协调人蹇宏说。
'said the blues's chief justice.
无奈作罢之后，2月13日他派出包括新任总裁刘挺军在内的五人小组前往武汉，现场协调医院改造、物资调度等工作。
But then, on February 13, he sent a team of five people, including the new president, Liu Changjun, to Wuhan to coordinate the transformation of the hospital and the dispatch of materials.
前线每天发布一份战报，身为总指挥的陈东升在后方也先后发布过多份“号外”。
Front Line issued a daily war report, as the commander-in-chief of Chen Dongsheng in the rear has also issued a number of "outside."
分别是1月23日向楚商发出的捐赠倡议，2月6日关爱医护人员及家属的倡议，2月12日给楚商的抗疫总动员令和2月13日发动泰康力量支援一线抗疫情的总动员令。
They are the donation initiative to Chu Shang on 23 January, the initiative to care for medical staff and their families on 6 February, the general mobilization order for Chu Shang on 12 February and the general mobilization order for Tai Hong forces to support the frontline fight against the epidemic on 13 February.
“放开干，要钱出钱。
"Let go of it and ask for money.
将在外军令有所不受，大胆在一线指挥，拿不定的随时汇报”，无论蹇宏还是刘挺军，都曾受到陈东升类似的鼓舞。
Will not receive military orders, bold in the front-line command, uncertain reporting at any time, "regardless of Jian Hong or Liu Tsing Jun, Chen Dongsheng has been similarly inspired.
也是在这种精神的感召下，武大校友各显神通，分别从韩国、伊朗调集物资，数以万计的企业家校友和楚商从纽约、伦敦、欧洲等地调物资。
Under the inspiration of this spirit, WU alumni have made remarkable contributions to mobilize materials from Korea and Iran, and tens of thousands of alumni and businessmen from New York, London and Europe.
截至3月初，武大校友企业家联谊会和湖北省楚商联合会共为此次疫情募得超过20亿元的款项和物资。
By early March, the Wu Alumni Entrepreneur Association and the Hubei Chu Chamber of Commerce had raised more than 2 billion yuan in funds and materials for the outbreak.
此次疫情中，一呼百应的“武大现象”令人瞩目。
In this epidemic, the "Wu Da phenomenon" is remarkable.
“如果说北大、清华代表这个国家的主流和官方形象，那么像武大、南开这些学校代表的就是民间的一种力量，抱团精神很强。
"If Peking University and Tsinghua University represent the mainstream and official image of the country, then schools like Wu Da and Nankai represent a kind of folk power with a strong spirit of solidarity.
人人动员、人人出力、人人冲在前、人人是英雄，这种忘我的牺牲精神，在武大校史上前所未有、空前绝后。
The selfless sacrifice of everyone who mobilizes, everyone who contributes, everyone who runs before, everyone who is a hero is unprecedented in the history of the University of martial arts.
”对此陈东升不吝溢美之词。
Chen Dongsheng lavished praise on this.
蹇宏自1980年就与陈东升相识，读书时两人是同住一栋宿舍楼的师兄弟。
Jian Hong met Chen Dongsheng in 1980, when they shared a dormitory building with his brother.
40年间，无论工作关系怎样变迁，蹇宏始终觉得陈东升像一位无话不谈的兄长，同时也非常钦佩他在组织战略和治理结构上的非凡才干。
In 40 years, and no matter how the working relationship changes, Mr. Chen feels like a talkative older brother, and admires his extraordinary ability to organize strategic and governance structures.
“在这样的危机时刻，更能体现他的领导力，指挥非常周全，每一个节点的方向都非常到位。
"In a time of crisis like this, his leadership is more visible, his command is very thorough, and every node is in place.
我们在一线能够全身心投入，也跟他的指挥有莫大的关系。
We were able to dedicate ourselves in the first line and had a lot to do with his command.
”陈东升的微信里有五六十核心群，上至各级领导，下到公司员工，每天不停开会、协调，从1月底到3月初一直在超负荷工作。
Chen Dongsheng's micro-letter has a core of 50 or 60 core groups, from leaders at all levels to company employees, who meet and coordinate daily and are overworked from the end of January to the beginning of March.
没完没了的事务、没日没夜地盯着手机，甚至造成了坐骨神经痛。
The endless business, staring at the phone day and night, even caused sciatica.
他同时指挥泰康、武大北京校友会、楚商联合会三条战线，一天也没停止过战斗。
He also directed Tai Kang, Wuda Beijing Alumni Association, Chu Shang Federation three fronts, not a day has stopped fighting.
同样由他担任会长的武大北京校友会是最早行动起来的校友会之一。
The Beijing Alumni Association, also chaired by him, was one of the first alumni associations to take action.
1月24日开始，北京校友会在4天内构建了由9个行动小组、4个后方保障小组组成的百人志愿者团队，目前已为疫情筹款3600万元，在武大全球校友会中首屈一指。
Since January 24, the Beijing Alumni Association has set up a 100-person volunteer team of nine action teams and four rear support teams in four days.
陈东升告诉记者，“我现在最好的一个称呼是东升大哥，这个称呼是不容易得到的。
"The best title I have is Dongsheng Big Brother, which is not easy to get," Chen told reporters.
你可以像一个大哥哥一样对待师弟、师妹，但是你又是一个带头大哥，大家都拥戴，愿意团结在你身边。
You can treat like a big brother, sister, but you are a leader brother, we all support, willing to unite around you.
这个身份不是组织任命的，是靠你的实力、靠你的奉献和你的为人长期形成的。
This status is not appointed by the organization, is based on your strength, your dedication and your long-term development.
武大校友会这些年发展很不错，不能说是靠我一个人，但起码我是一个重要的带头大哥。
The alumni association of WU has developed well over the years. It can't be said that I am alone, but at least I am an important leader.
”“非典遗产”疫情不仅对所有人的日常生活造成巨大影响，也给湖北政坛带来一场地震。
"The SARS heritage" epidemic has not only had a tremendous impact on the daily lives of all people, but also brought an earthquake to Hubei politics.
作为与当地政商界交集颇多的企业家，陈东升一方面能体会领导者的包袱有多重、压力有多大，同时也深知主帅的镇定有多重要。
As an entrepreneur who interacts with the local government and business community, Chen Dongsheng, on the one hand, knows how much a leader's burden is, how stressed he is, and how important his calm is.
身为泰康的主帅，能在“突如其来”的疫情面前指挥若定，陈东升靠的经验和机制。
As the coach of Tai Kang, can "sudden" in the face of the outbreak of command, Chen Dongsheng rely on the experience and mechanisms.
“所谓镇定，其实就是因为从非典走过来。
"Calming down is actually coming from SARS.
”他说。
'he said.
在泰康保险集团内部，流传着公司历史上最著名的三张照片。
Three of the most famous photographs in the company's history were circulated within the group.
其中一张拍摄于2003年“非典”时期，陈东升向北京通州医院一位被SARS夺去生命的医护人员家属送去理赔款。
One was filmed during SARS in 2003, when Chen Dongsheng sent compensation to the family of a medical worker killed by SARS at Tongzhou Hospital in Beijing.
那一年，陈东升46岁，泰康保险刚刚创办7年。
That year, Chen Dongsheng was 46, and Taicang was just seven years old.
“我为什么对非典印象那么深？公司三个月没有保费收入，每个月的费用是1.5亿。
"Why am I so impressed with SARS? The company has no premium for three months and the monthly cost is 150 million."
当时我的压力非常大，再多两个月我们就扛不住了。
I was under so much pressure at the time that we couldn't carry it for another two months.
”陈东升回忆。
Chen Dongsheng recalls.
新冠肺炎疫情中传统保险行业也遭遇了普遍业绩下滑。
The traditional insurance industry has also suffered a general decline in performance during the New Crown Pneumonia epidemic.
虽然集团每月开销50亿，但用总裁刘挺军的话说，到目前为止也只是“伤了点皮毛”。
Although the group spends $5bn a month, it has so far "only scratched the surface," in the words of President Liu Jingjun.
2019年，泰康资产管理资产总规模超17000亿、营收近2000亿、净利润超200亿，并从2018年起入选《财富》杂志“世界500强”。
In 2019, Taicang has more than $1.7 trillion in assets, close to $200 billion in revenue and a net profit of more than $20 billion, and has been listed in Fortune 500 magazine since 2018.
17年前的那场“战疫”，让陈东升积累了应对灾难的宝贵经验，他称之为“非典遗产”。
The "plague" 17 years ago allowed Chen to accumulate valuable experience in dealing with the disaster, which he called the "SARS legacy."
2003年，泰康在保险行业内率先推出“抗击SARS专项保险”，并向北京抗击SARS的医护人员捐赠保额1.5亿元保险。
In 2003, Taikang pioneered the introduction of the "Anti-SARS Special Insurance" in the insurance industry, and donated 150 million yuan in insurance to health-care workers fighting SARS in Beijing.
这一产品从设计到保监会审批、上市销售也只用了四天，创下中国保险史上的最快纪录。
The product also took only four days to design, approve and sell, setting the fastest record in China's insurance history.
“金融保险企业第一时间响应，给医护人员送保险是最重要的，因为他们在前方打仗。
"Financial insurance companies are the first to respond, and it is important to have health care workers insured because they are fighting ahead.
我们知道这些在大灾难来的时候，医生、记者他们都是前方一线的战士，风险是很大的。
We know that when a catastrophe strikes, doctors, journalists -- they're all front-line fighters, and the stakes are high.
”陈东升说。
"said Chen.
新冠肺炎疫情发生后，他再次决定向医务人员、新闻工作者赠送保险，并针对疫情，推出了“爱心保”公益计划。
After the outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia, he again decided to give insurance to medical personnel, journalists, and to the epidemic, launched a "love to protect" public welfare program.
1月21日，泰康启动了灾害应急响应机制，这也是“非典”留下的重要遗产。
On January 21, Tai Hong launched the Disaster Emergency Response Mechanism, an important legacy of SARS.
“非典的教训可能很多人都忘了，毕竟事情已经过去这么多年，但对保险公司来讲，抵御风险是我们的责任。
"Many people may have forgotten the lesson of SARS. After all, so many years have passed, but it is our responsibility to insure against risk.
非典之后我们建立了一整套应急机制，只要发生灾难就立即启动应急，主要是迅速搜索我们的客户、迅速地赔付。
In the wake of SARS, we have put in place a whole range of emergency mechanisms to jump-start an emergency response in the event of a disaster, primarily by quickly searching our clients and paying them promptly.
”1月26日，泰康完成了新冠肺炎疫情发生后的首例理赔。
On January 26, Taikang completed its first settlement since the outbreak of pneumonia in the New Crown.
对于保险行业来说，赔付太多显然不是合算的买卖。
Paying too much is clearly not a good deal for the insurance industry.
如何从根本上防范风险，既是生意，也是公益。
How to prevent the risk fundamentally is a business as well as a public good.
这些日子陈东升在读《血疫》，一本讲述埃博拉病毒的书，从更深层次关注传染病和公共卫生。
These days, Chen Dongsheng is reading Bloody Disease, a book about Ebola that focuses more deeply on infectious diseases and public health.
“过去40年我们以经济建设为中心，政府基本都是抓经济建设、抓项目、抓GDP，城市的综合治理特别是公共卫生治理结构肯定是短板，不光是武汉的短板，也是整个国家和社会的短板。
"In the past 40 years, we have focused on economic development, the government has basically focused on economic construction, programs and GDP, and the overall management of cities, especially public health, is definitely short-board, not only short-board in Wuhan, but also short-board of the whole country and society.
”基于这种认知，他希望国家完善治理结构和公共卫生体系，同时也大力资助长效机制建设——设立一亿元公共卫生及流行病防治基金，捐赠1000万，资助武汉大学病毒学国家重点实验室开展新型冠状病毒病原学及防治研究。
In recognition of this, he hopes that the country will improve its governance structure and public health system, while also vigorously funding the construction of a long-term mechanism - a $100 million fund for public health and epidemic prevention and treatment, and a donation of $10 million to the Wuhan University Virology National Key Laboratory to carry out research on new coronavirus etiology and prevention.
“本世纪20年中国已经经历过两次传染病，这样的事不能再发生了。

”走过“非典”、汶川地震和新冠肺炎疫情后他得出一个感悟：平时尊重市场，关键时刻靠举国体制。
"After walking through SARS, the Wenchuan earthquake and the outbreak of pneumonia in Wenchuan, he came to an understanding: usually respect the market, the critical moment depends on the juguo system.
“当你事业成功后会获得很高的社会荣誉，社会对你有很高的期许，因为你掌握巨大的资源，有影响力、号召力，也就自觉不自觉地扮演一个正能量的角色，为社会做公益。
"Society has high expectations of you when you succeed in your career, because you have enormous resources, influence, and convening power, and you consciously or unconsciously play a positive energy role for the good of society.
我其实是一个公益家，也可以算是个慈善家。

不要认为慈善家就是捐多少钱，捐钱很重要，但不是根本，根本就是把企业做好。
Do not think that the philanthropist just donated how much money, donation is important, but not fundamental, is to do a good job of the enterprise.
