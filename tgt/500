关注并星标消费新声不错过泛消费任何最新动态___灾情尤其是规模性的疾病惯于与大城市如影随形，而“城市会因为一些人的腐败而蒙羞”，但对于这些生活于斯的武汉人来说，「不管政府做了什么，人们对自己出生或者成长的地方产生的归属感」，会驱动他们做些什么。
For Wuhan people living in Wuhan, "whatever the government does, people feel a sense of belonging to the place where they were born or raised" drives them to do something.
作者 | 邵乐乐编辑 | 罗立璇武汉人邓歌把父母安置在三亚后，又在20号回了武汉。
Rao Lixuan, an editor of Shao Le Le, placed his parents in Sanya and returned to Wuhan on the 20th.
她是武汉本地嘻哈厂牌「不良公社」的主理人，要赶在年前给公司的三十几个音乐人都分了钱。
She is the director of Wuhan local hip-hop brand "bad commune", had to catch up with the company's more than 30 musicians shared money.
那时候，邓歌心里还盘算着要让20个本地Rapper在3月初参与一个武汉的大型演出，“大家都把它当成节日来看待”。
At the time, Dunge thought about getting 20 local Rapper to take part in a major Wuhan show in early March, "everyone took it as a holiday."
然而，从这一天开始，整个世界都变了。
However, from that day on, the whole world changed.
钟南山在邓歌回到武汉的晚间明确了疫情可以“人传人”，3天以后，离汉通道被正式关闭。
Zhong Nan Shan in Deng Ge back to Wuhan in the evening clear that the outbreak can "person-to-person", three days later, the Han Channel was officially closed.
现实灾难和恐慌情绪排山倒海般涌向武汉。
The reality of disaster and panic has poured into Wuhan.
更重要的是，除了确诊病例指数级增长之外，物资紧缺成为最紧要的舆论关注点，武汉8家医院甚至亲自发公告，直接向社会各界征集捐赠防护物资。
More importantly, in addition to the exponential increase in confirmed cases, material shortages have become the most pressing public concern, and eight hospitals in Wuhan have even issued notices to solicit donations of protective materials directly from all sectors of society.
商业主体的捐赠响应很迅速，但这些外援运到武汉都需要时间，等待红会等机构分发，则需要更长时间，这几天医院怎么办？为了赶在外援到来之前给医院找到能用的医疗物资，四位武汉女生组成了一个名叫“口罩天使小分队”的微信救援群给医院救急。
However, it will take longer for the aid to arrive in Wuhan and wait for it to be distributed by organizations such as the Red Cross, so what will happen to the hospitalsTo find usable medical supplies for hospitals in time for foreign aid to arrive, four Wuhan girls have formed a small rescue group called Mask Angel Squad to rescue the hospital.
除了带头的邓歌，还有小喻和她的朋友——原本患了腰伤在家休养的Momo，以及做茶叶出品、信奉“人无癖不与之交”的“小灵通”曹杨。
In addition to leading Deng Ge, there was Xiaoyu and her friends - Momo, who used to recuperate from a waist injury, and Cao Yang, a "little psychopath" who made tea products and believed in "no human hobbies."
在四位女生的组织下，扩张到100多个人的天使小分队，就近武汉找钱、找医疗物资、找一线医生、找物流渠道，这些天帮55家武汉市内医疗机构捐赠了近万件防护服和20万个口罩。
With the help of four girls, the group has expanded to include more than 100-strong angelic squads, reaching Wuhan for money, medical supplies, first-line doctors and logistics channels.
类似天使小分队这样的志愿组织，在疫情中成为了武汉的一抹亮色。
Voluntary organizations such as the Angel Squad have become a bright spot in Wuhan during the outbreak.
这些自发形成的组织，带来的凝聚力、参与感和共同体意识，在武汉最慌乱的那几天，是这个大机器无暇顾及个体时的重要补充力量。
The cohesion, engagement and sense of community that these spontaneous organizations bring to Wuhan during its most tumultuous days have been an important complement to the great machine's leisure time for individuals.
参与其中的个体，成为平时纸面上“城市精神”“市民精神”的具象表现，这些个体也由此被深深地嵌入城市肌理。
The individuals involved have become the embodiment of the "urban spirit" and "civic spirit" on the paper, and these individuals are deeply embedded in the urban texture.
跑在时间前面_邓歌直接感知到医疗物资的紧缺，源于23号捐的1万个医用口罩。
Run in front of time _ Deng Ge directly sensed the shortage of medical supplies, from 23 donated 10,000 medical masks.
那天晚上，有个姑娘在朋友圈卖口罩，“湖北的朋友优先，半小时要确定”。
That night, a girl selling masks in a circle of friends, "Hubei friends first, half an hour to make sure."
当时还没人买这姑娘的口罩，邓歌看不得人着急，就决定自己买了捐给武汉的医院，还在朋友圈询问了谁有医院的收货地址。
She decided to donate it to a hospital in Wuhan. She also asked friends who had a hospital receiving address.
半小时内就有人帮邓歌联系上了协和医院和湖北省中医院送出了这1万个口罩。
Within half an hour, someone helped Deng Ge get in touch with Concorde Hospital and Hubei Provincial Chinese Hospital to deliver the 10,000 masks.
但她发现，不止一家医院缺口罩，很多医院还缺防护服和护目镜。
But she found that there was more than one hospital gap, and many hospitals lacked protective clothing and goggles.
有个小姑娘甚至求着邓歌说，她妈妈的医院一件防护服都没有，但每天都在接触确诊患者的家属，如果有资源，她愿意出钱买。
One little girl even begged Dunge to say that her mother's hospital had no protective clothing, but that she was in daily contact with the families of confirmed patients and was willing to pay for them if resources were available.
更多人找到邓歌问她，还有没有物资渠道？他们也想买了捐给医院。
More people went to Dunge to ask her if there were any supplies? They also wanted to buy a donation to the hospital.
在这种强烈的渴求推动下，邓歌的朋友小喻建议，一起拉一个「自愿进入、一起出钱出力」的群组，进行捐款救急。
Driven by this intense desire, Deng's friend Yu suggested that he join a "volunteer group" to donate money to help with the emergency.
于是，1月24日上午11点左右，一个名为“口罩天使小分队”的群组正式成立，小喻还拉来了原本就在帮武汉医院寻找资源的曹杨和有医疗从业经验的Momo。
So around 11 a.m. on January 24, a group called "Mask Angel Squad" was set up, bringing in Cao Yang, who had been looking for resources to help Wuhan Hospital, and Momo, who had medical experience.
三个多小时后，邓歌在朋友圈告诉大家，小分队已经完成了第二批总计1000个N95口罩+1万元捐款，并公示了三位捐赠者的信息。
More than three hours later, Dunge told a group of friends that the team had completed a second batch of 1,000 N95 masks, plus $10,000 in donations, and released information about three donors.
武汉rapper泥鳅也被邓歌带动着参与进了这场募捐。
Wuhan rapper loach was also led by Deng Ge to participate in the fund-raising.
邓歌说，她收泥鳅的钱，是因为泥鳅已经闯出了名堂，是“武汉rapper里的佼佼者”，但其实rapper们都不宽裕。
Dunge said she collected the loach money because the loach had made a name for itself and was "the best in Wuhan rapper," but none of the rapper were well off.
在多个医院物资告急、患者涌入医院的那个夜晚，很多人都已经忘了，24日是大年三十。
On the night of the emergency in many hospitals and the influx of patients into the hospital, many people have forgotten that the 24th is New Year's Eve.
小喻吃了顿饭的工夫，刚成立的口罩群人数就超过了60个，有一线医护人员，有可以提供物资的，也有想要帮忙和捐款的，“还有医护人员的家属过来哭的”。
At mealtimes, the number of freshly formed masks exceeded 60. There were front-line medical staff, people who could provide supplies, people who wanted help and donations, and "the families of paramedics who came to cry."
他们把通过资质审核的医生分流到了武汉地区医护人员群和周边市县的医护人员工作群，Momo负责统计、对接和跟进这些医院的需求，也帮助鉴定产品是否符合标准，并且收集医院的接收证明和捐赠函。
They redirected the qualified doctors to the Wuhan district medical staff and the medical staff working in the surrounding cities and counties. Momo was responsible for statistics, docking and follow-up on the needs of these hospitals, helped to verify the conformity of the products and collected certificates of acceptance and donation letters from the hospitals.
对于小分队来说，钱不是问题，朋友圈很多人都很积极踊跃。
For the small team, money is not a problem, many people in the circle of friends are very active and enthusiastic.
加上寻求物资帮助的人越来越多，需要经手的钱也越来越多。
Coupled with the growing number of people seeking material assistance, there is an increasing need for money to pass through.
小喻因为在武汉一家知名企业任总裁办主任，人脉比较广，就开始专门负责「找钱」。
Xiaoyu in Wuhan because of a well-known enterprises as president of the Office of the Director, a relatively wide network, began to take charge of "change money."
邓歌则负责总体协调，找钱、找资源、解决物流都参与。
Deng Ge is in charge of overall coordination, change money, find resources, solve logistics are all involved.
他们的原则是，只有找到新的物资，才会进行针对性募捐。
Their principle is that targeted fund-raising will take place only if new supplies are found.
因为当时物资很缺，而募捐的组织很多，有钱也不一定能产生作用。
Because there was a shortage of material resources and a large number of fund-raising organizations, money did not necessarily make a difference.
小喻后来统计，从24号到26号这三天，认识但不熟悉的朋友，平时只有工作联系的上司，甚至压根就不认识的陌生人，汇总到她那里的捐赠数额超过40万。
My friends, whom I knew but were not familiar with, collected more than 400,000 donations from their work-related superiors and even strangers, whom I did not know at all, from the 24th to the 26th.
“他们都愿意相信我们，我们就要对得起他们的信任。
"They want to believe in us, and we have to live up to their trust.
”兑现这份信任，意味着要帮这40多万元找到符合医院需求的防护物资，并且能够在武汉封城的情况下克服物流难题，快速送到一线医护人员的手上，考验的是找货、配送、分发的系统能力。
Fulfilling this trust means finding protective materials that meet the needs of hospitals for more than 400,000 yuan, and overcoming logistical difficulties in the face of Wuhan sealing off the city, delivering it quickly to front-line medical personnel, testing the system's ability to find goods, deliver and distribute.
邓歌自己捐赠的1万个口罩也是从外地运过来的，她辗转许久第二天才找到了京东来运。
Dunge's own donation of 10,000 masks from the outside world, she toss and toss the next day to find the East Beijing transport.
考虑到春节假期和武汉关闭对外通道的影响，进入武汉的运力更紧缺，大部分都要经过至少三四天才能送到一线医务人员手中。
Given the impact of the Spring Festival holiday and Wuhan's closure of the external passageway, there is a greater shortage of capacity to enter Wuhan, most of which will take at least three to four days to reach front-line medical personnel.
如果经由红会捐赠或定向捐赠，则意味着更长的流通周期。
If donated or directed through ICRC, it means a longer circulation cycle.
但正在超负荷运转的医院等不及了。
But the overstretched hospital can't wait.
生命的抢救必须争分夺秒。
Life must be saved in seconds.
从24日到28日，武汉市内的确诊病例已经从1287例暴增至5974例，尽管从政府救援通道到民营企业都迅速行动起来捐钱捐物，物资没有到位之前，这三四天的空缺怎么办？天使小分队必须“跑在时间前面”。
From July 24 to 28, the number of confirmed cases in Wuhan increased from 1,287 to 5,974, though everything from government aid channels to private enterprises moved quickly to donate money and goods.
她们开始把物资源头转向武汉及其周边，就近调货的话，一天就可以送到医护人员手上。
They began to turn the source of supplies to Wuhan and its surrounding areas, the nearest transfer, a day can be delivered to the hands of medical personnel.
一个问题是，当时有一个硬性规定：想要让医院以院办名义接收并且开具捐赠证明，所有的医疗物资必须符合国家“三证”标准。
One problem was that there was a mandatory requirement that hospitals receive and issue donation certificates on behalf of hospitals, and that all medical supplies meet the national "three-certificate" standard.
曹杨这几天经手的物资无数，但她只在1月23日对接到一家有“三证”资质的厂家，还是因为行动得早、有时间差。
Cao Yang has handled countless supplies over the past few days, but she only received a "three-certificate" qualification on January 23, or because of the early action, time difference.
但在疫情恶势明朗化之后，根据《财新》的报道，几乎所有有生产资质的厂家都被各地政府管控了。
But after the epidemic became clear, almost all qualified manufacturers were controlled by local governments, according to Caixin.
“三证”产品接触不到了，主要负责采购的曹杨又想到出口产品，这类产品有国外机构的资质证明，符合实际的使用标准，但没有经过国内体系的检测，医院院办不敢按章程接收，即使收了，也无法开具正式的捐赠票据。
Cao Yang, who was mainly in charge of purchasing the products, also thought of export products, such as certificates of qualification from foreign institutions that meet the actual standards of use, but they were not tested by the domestic system, and hospital offices dared not accept them according to their articles of association.
到24号，曹杨找到一批出口货想尽快送到前线，但因为没有“三证”，医院收不了，她对这样的两难境地有些生气，“一线医护人员一边哭一边说什么东西都没有，一边我这边送不了，真**太难受了。
Cao Yang found an export shipment on the 24th and wanted to get it to the front line as soon as possible. But without the "three cards," the hospital could not accept it.
”生死博弈之时，冲在一线的科室工作人员先松了口，一批在武汉的出口防护服被小分队成功对接到了各大医院具体科室的人手上。
"The game of life and death, rushed in the front of the department staff first relaxed, a number of export protective clothing in Wuhan by the small team to the major hospitals received the hands of specific departments.
曹杨说，这些医护人员实在是没办法了，如果不是弹尽粮绝，他们也不会接受出口物资的捐赠。
Cao Yang said that the medical staff is really no way, if not out of food, they will not accept the donation of export materials.
但对于天使小分队来说，绕开院办和采购部，意味着这只能属于“私人赠送”，他们可以不要医院给出的官方捐赠证明，那如何向捐款人交代？邓歌他们索性让科室的人准备一份加盖了科室公章的签收证明，作为捐赠凭证反馈给大家；实在不行，拿上自己的工作牌与签收物资合影也可以。
But for the angel teams, bypassing the courtyard and purchasing department means that it can only be a "private gift" and that they can be held accountable to donors without an official donation certificate from the hospital.Deng Ge They simply ask the staff of the department to prepare a receipt certificate stamped with the official seal of the department and send it back to us as evidence of donation.
▲26日，一家医院收到了天使小分队捐赠的防护服___他们也担心过物资是否符合一线的需求，好在后续跟踪反馈发现，医护人员的使用效果比较好。
26, a hospital received the angel team donated protective clothing _ _ they also worried about the first-line needs of the goods, but follow-up feedback found that the use of health-care personnel better.
武汉人不会坐以待毙_只能在地下捐赠，他们就以“救急”和“私下赠送”为原则，碰到符合使用标准的物资，就马上抢下来，“像盯股市大盘似的”。
Wuhan people will not wait to die _ can only in the underground donation, they on the principle of "emergency" and "private gifts," the principle of the use of materials, immediately seized, "like staring at the stock market.
找到货源，小分队会先向一线科室的主任或护士长确认这些东西行不行。
When they find the source, the team will first confirm to the head of the front-line department or head nurse if it is all right.
“他们说行我们就送，不行我们就不送，因为他们自己最清楚，这个东西能否给自己做到防护”，而且“总比裸着什么防护都没有要强”。
"They said we could send it, not we, because they knew best that it would protect them" and that "it was better than nothing."
邓歌定下的原则还包括分配数量要均匀，每个医院几百套，“我们不能救所有的人，但是我们碰到的那些，绝不能让他在群里面哀嚎两天什么都没有。
Dunge also laid down the principle of even distribution, hundreds of units per hospital, "We can't save everyone, but we can't let him whine in the crowd for two days without anything.
”募捐第一天，天使小分队连续工作了15个小时，总计落实了4000个3M9001口罩和2100套防护服。
On the first day of the fund-raising, angel teams worked 15 hours a day, delivering a total of 4,000 3M9001 masks and 2,100 suits.
给她们提供防护服是武汉一家供应商，合伙人老王连年夜饭都没吃，就被拉来连夜给医院发防护服，因为仓库也在武汉，很多医院当晚就在现场拿到了这些防护服。
To provide them with protective clothing is a Wuhan supplier, partner Lao Wang did not even eat dinner, was pulled to the hospital overnight protective clothing, because the warehouse is also in Wuhan, many hospitals on the scene that night received these protective clothing.
到第二天，天使小分队总计向20多家医院捐赠了4330件防护服。
By the next day, angel teams had donated 4,330 protective clothing to more than 20 hospitals.
▲天使小分队公布的单日募捐详情，为了增加公信力，让大家知道去哪里找到他们，四位女生把自己的就职公司和真实姓名都写了上去___更多人看到他们在做的事，踊跃地加入进来。
In order to increase their credibility and let everyone know where to find them, the four girls wrote about their company and their real names. More people saw what they were doing, and jumped in.
一个叫琬晴的女孩儿，不仅帮口罩群募资、寻找物资，还帮她们面对部分的质疑声，因为记不住口罩型号，就把型号写在了自己的微信昵称后面。
Carmen, a girl, not only raises money and supplies for masks, but also helps them face some of the doubts, writing models after their nicknames because they can't remember the mask model.
小喻的朋友钱婧本来在接送医护人员，知道他们最后一公里送货有难度后，主动过来帮她们送货。
Xiao Yu's friend Qian Jing, a doctor, knew that their last kilometer of delivery was difficult, and offered to help them deliver.
唯一的男生小杜，因为开着一辆“鄂A”的车经过湖南，被当地人上报后全家被迫原地隔离，他就只能远程帮四位女生管理几个微信群。
Dee, the only boy, was forced to remain isolated after being reported by locals as he drove past Hunan in a "E-E" car, leaving him to run several microcosm groups for four girls at a distance.
人性的闪光点在微暗时刻尤其慰藉人心。
The brilliance of humanity is particularly comforting in the dark hours.
武汉的防护服供应商老王被医护人员拉着感谢了之后，“一拍大腿”，索性又联合天使小分队加捐了2500件防护服。
Wuhan's protective clothing supplier Lao Wang was pulled by medical personnel thank, "a pat on the thigh", simply and joint angel team donated 2500 pieces of protective clothing.
浙江的洗手消毒液厂家，知道他们是在支援武汉之后，立即决定以成本价向她们供货。
Zhejiang hand washing disinfectant manufacturers, know they are in support of Wuhan, immediately decided to supply them at cost price.
等到1月26日，接近不眠不休运转了三天的天使小分队已经把5030件防护服送到了30多家医疗机构的手上。
By Jan. 26, an angel team, close to three sleepless days, had delivered 5,030 suits to more than 30 health facilities.
Momo说那几天的微信好友多了1000多个，负责找物资采购渠道的曹杨，电话号码被传播到朋友圈之后一度变成了热线电话。
He said he had more than 1,000 "micro-mail friends" in those days and that Cao Yang, who was responsible for sourcing channels, became a telephone hotline after being relayed to friends.
那天晚上，曹杨在朋友圈向大家实时更新了最新募捐成果，并宣布接下来他们将停止募资捐赠，转型为资源对接群，为一线医护、物资资源和想要捐款的人提供对接服务。
That night Cao Yang updated his latest fundraising results in real time with friends and announced that they would stop fundraising and turn into a resource docking group, offering docking services for front-line medical care, material resources and people who want to donate.
她如此解释转型的原因：除了疲于应付，他们也担心自己经验不足，控制不住，这么复杂庞大的项目如果持续下去可能会失控。
She explains why: in addition to struggling to cope, they also worry that their inexperience and uncontrollable, such a large and complex project could spin out of control if continued.
在这几天，因为只公布了捐款明细和大概的物资购买情况，已经有人跑来质疑他们，“别人捐赠都有视频，为什么你们没有”。
Over the past few days, people have come to question them, "Everyone else donates video, why don't you have it," because only details of donations and approximate purchases have been made public.
还有人盗用他们的捐赠接收图片，这是小喻组织捐赠以来唯一不舒服的事情。
Others steal their donations to receive pictures, the only thing that has bothered metonymy since its donation.
Momo很担心他们几个“做了好事，反而会有麻烦”。
Momo is worried that some of them "do good things and get into trouble."
邓歌倒是不怕，但她鼓励本想低调的几位女生跟想要采访他们的媒体聊聊，因为“这样信息会更加透明”。
Dunge is not afraid, but she encourages the low-key girls to talk to the media who want to interview them because "it makes the information more transparent."
她还有个模糊的判断——事情好像有了好转迹象。
She also had a vague judgment that things seemed to be getting better.
26日下午，小喻发了两张武汉火车站的照片，照片显示站台上堆满了从全国各地运送过来的医疗物资，“相信国家一定会助我大武汉挺过难关”。
On the afternoon of May 26, Yu sent two pictures of Wuhan railway station, showing the platform full of medical materials from all over the country, "I believe the country will help me to survive the difficulties.
邓歌在朋友圈分享了这两张照片，告诉大家“很多物资到了武汉”。
Deng Ge in the circle of friends shared these two photos, told everyone "a lot of materials to Wuhan."
也在这一天，民政部刊文动员慈善力量依法有序参与、支持肺炎疫情防控，但要求慈善组织为湖北省武汉市疫情防控工作募集的款物，统一由湖北省红十字会等五家机构统一接收。
On the same day, the Ministry of Civil Affairs mobilized charitable forces to participate in and support the prevention and control of the pneumonia epidemic in an orderly manner according to law, but demanded that the money and materials collected by charitable organizations for the prevention and control of the epidemic in Wuhan, Hubei Province, be unified and accepted by the Hubei Red Cross Society.
刊文发布后，据北京大学法学院教授葛云松的说法，医院就只能接受统一调配，不敢直接接收民间捐赠了。
According to Ge Yunsong, a professor at Peking University's law school, hospitals are forced to accept a unified allocation and are afraid to accept donations directly from the public.
邓歌还想着既然物资都已经到武汉了，他们不如及时转方向支援一些二级城市，她看到黄冈、天门的医护人员在他们群里哀嚎，她很难受，“别人都领到东西了，就他们什么都没有”。
Deng also thought that now that the supplies have arrived in Wuhan, they might as well turn around in time to support some of the secondary cities. She saw Huanggang and Tianmen medical workers whining in their midst.
他们在26日当天就单独拉了四个针对二级城市的告急小组，让有资源调动能力的募捐人单独对接这些医院，“我跟一个已经捐过5万元的募捐人说，你别再捐款了，你就直接帮黄冈、天门这两个城市的医院解决一下物资吧。
On the 26th, they pulled four separate emergency teams for the secondary cities, leaving the resource-mobilizing fund-raisers to docking the hospitals alone.I told a fundraiser who had already donated 50,000 yuan that you would stop donating money and help the hospitals in the cities of Huanggang and Tianmen.
”那天晚上，邓歌自己又听了无数遍《武汉的夜》，这是她的rapper朋友们在2019年秋天创作的歌，歌里写的所有景点都历历在目，一些景点和灯光秀还配合军运会重新妆点了一番。
That night, Dunge himself listened to Wuhan Night, a song written by her rapper friends in the autumn of 2019, in which all the sights and lights were vividly seen and some of the sights and light shows were redecorated in conjunction with the Games.
“秋天的时候都是那么美好，结果现在到了冬天，生活变成了这个样子，就很感伤。
"Autumn is such a beautiful time, as a result, now in winter, life has become like this, very sad.
”▲邓歌拍摄的武汉___末了，她告诉我，她已经做好了坚持两个月的准备，“我们武汉人都不是那种坐以待毙的性格”。
"Dunge shooting Wuhan _ _ last, she told me that she has been ready to adhere to two months of preparation," we Wuhan people are not that kind of character.
她签约的rapper本来这个假期应该在武汉训练的，但她现在也不知道什么时候可以再恢复，她在考虑把公司的音乐人聚集到网上制作音乐，去年他们就帮腾讯做了一些版权音乐，“很多音乐人靠这个吃饭，我们那些孩子如果不能来公司，我在网上也能把这个项目操持起来。
The rapper, whom she signed up to train in Wuhan this holiday season, isn't sure when she'll get back on track, considering bringing the company's musicians online to make music. Last year they did some copyrighted music for Tencent.
”万一武汉没有抑制住第二次大爆发，食物也短缺的话，邓歌说她还打算联合餐饮企业搞食物捐赠，“如果到时候餐饮成了问题，那餐饮业就应该站出来人，对不对？”“人人都是你”_转型资源对接群之后，因为有大量一线科室的联系方式，碰到有捐赠资源的人，天使小分队就把这些人直接对接给科室，“这样子是最快速有效的”。
"If Wuhan doesn't contain the second outbreak and food shortages, Deng said she also plans to work with catering companies on food donations." If catering becomes a problem, then the catering industry should step forward, right? "
很多人知道了他们做的事儿，也相信他们能够快速把捐赠物资送到一线。
A lot of people know what they're doing, and they believe they can quickly bring donations to the front line.
他们还借用一手的信息优势，较早转向了大家还没注意到的周边产品的募捐，比如长面罩、长鞋套、洗手液和自热饭、压缩饼干。
They also used their first-hand information advantage to turn earlier to fund-raising for peripheral products that no one had noticed, such as long face masks, long shoe covers, hand sanitizers and self-heating meals and crackers.
2月3日，在家憋了很久的邓歌又主动提出要去押车送货，这一天她们陆续把2360份自热饭送到了一线医生们的手上。
On Feb. 3, Ms. Deng, who had been waiting at home for so long, offered to deliver the car. On that day, 2,360 hot meals were delivered to front-line doctors.
▲天使小分队给医院送自热饭___邓歌说，虽然送得细、送的少，但他们一家一家跑，眼见为实，心理也踏实。
Angel team to the hospital from the hot meal _ _ Dunge said that although the delivery of small, but their family ran, see the reality, psychological well-being.
前几天的募捐和落实已经帮助他们积累了做捐赠的信任度。
The fund-raising and implementation of the last few days have helped them build up a level of trust in giving.
有人加曹杨的微信，想要通过天使小分队捐赠一批手洗消毒液，“他相信我们团队能够把所有的物资，所以他愿意我们代表他来完成这样一件事情。
Some Cao Yang's message, to donate a batch of hand washing disinfectant through the angel sub-unit, "He believes our team can put all the supplies, so he wants us to do such a thing on his behalf.
”这个捐赠人找到的消毒液生产厂家在浙江，厂家也答应第二天就给他们发货，大家都很高兴。
"The donor found the disinfectant manufacturer in Zhejiang, and the manufacturer promised to deliver the product the next day.
但第二天一大早，浙江当地政府把包括这个厂家在内的有资质的生产企业都管起来了，厂家最后索性把一个外贸单拨出来救急武汉。
But the next morning, Zhejiang local government, including the manufacturers of qualified production enterprises have been up, manufacturers will finally put out a foreign trade list to rescue Wuhan.
曹杨正在跟进一批由一位华人从瑞士发往武汉的货。
Cao Yang is following up on a shipment sent to Wuhan by a Chinese from Switzerland.
这位姐姐本来去瑞士旅游，疫情爆发后，她把旅游行程全部停下来，通过瑞士当地医院采购到了一批货，但摆在面前的报关、清关和物流配送都还没有着落，尤其是在武汉已经不能停落飞机的情况下，通关需要去上海或周边的长沙等地，再从外地运到武汉，全程都顺利的话，加起来也需要八到十天的时间。
After the outbreak of the outbreak, the sister stopped all her trips to Switzerland and procured a lot of goods through the Swiss local hospital. However, customs declaration, customs clearance and logistics were not yet available, especially when Wuhan could not stop the aircraft, customs clearance to Shanghai or the surrounding Changsha, and from other places to Wuhan, all smooth, add up to 8 to 10 days.
“其实大家现在都想为武汉做事，但都做得很曲折。
"In fact, we all want to do things for Wuhan, but it is very tortuous.
”尤其是从国外进入中国的医疗物资，与国内本身的医疗体系标准不兼容，如何通过国内认证，是从世界各地运过来的救援物资会面临的实际障碍。
Medical supplies entering China from abroad, in particular, are incompatible with the standards of the country's own health-care system, and how to obtain domestic certification is a real obstacle to the delivery of relief supplies from all over the world.
更重要的是，即使各种层面的力量已经近乎动员了全球资源，人们还是发现，武汉的医院仍旧在防护用品紧缺的悬崖边缘。
More importantly, even as forces at all levels have mobilized near-global resources, it has been found that Wuhan hospitals are still on the edge of a cliff where supplies are scarce.
武汉近乎一个随时都在发生人道灾难的无底洞。
Wuhan is almost a bottomless pit in which a humanitarian disaster occurs at any time.
到1月30日，舆论矛头开始指向红十字会，他们接收了大量物资，但没有能力及时调配。
By 30 January, public opinion had begun to be directed against the Red Cross, which had received large quantities of supplies but was unable to deploy them in a timely manner.
甚至有网友扒出红会给武汉协和医院3000个普通口罩，却给莆田系两家医院3万多个“N95”口罩。
Even some netizens pick up the Red Cross will give Wuhan Concorde Hospital 3000 common masks, but to Putian Department of two hospitals more than 30,000 "N95" masks.
而武汉协和医院科室人员不止一次前往物资分配地武汉国博领取物资，也被拒绝。
Wuhan Concorde hospital staff more than once to the material distribution site Wuhan Guobao to collect supplies, was also rejected.
参与红会的志愿者也透露，有时候内部用纸记录，也不清点数量，速度极慢。
Volunteers involved in the Red Cross Society also revealed that sometimes the internal use of paper records, do not count the number, extremely slow.
物资捐赠卡在红会那儿，邓歌他们也气炸了。
Donations were made to the Red Cross, and Dunge they blew up.
几天后，大家还亲眼目睹了红十字会说「医院可以凭介绍信去领物资是造谣」的滑稽始末。
A few days later, they also witnessed the antics of the Red Cross saying that "hospitals can pick up supplies with letters of recommendation."
舆论对红十字会的指责，随着几名官员被惩处、火神山医院的竣工和方舱医院的开建，在昨日迎来一个小结点。
Public criticism of the Red Cross came to a head yesterday with the punishment of several officials, the completion of the Mount Fukuyama hospital and the opening of a square-cabin hospital.
2月4日的新闻联播播报，中宣部已经调集300多名记者进入湖北和武汉统筹疫情防控宣传，这意味着官方机制对武汉的援助已经初有成效。
In a news broadcast on February 4, the Ministry of Communication has mobilized more than 300 journalists into Hubei and Wuhan to coordinate disease prevention and control campaigns, which means that official assistance to Wuhan has begun to bear fruit.
▲邓歌在朋友圈公示了他们的募捐成果___来自政府层面的大体系初有成效后，天使小分队过手的捐赠物品少了，但他们也不敢松懈下来，不记名的「义务调配」和物资对接，每天都会在社群里快速推进。
Tang Ge announced their fund-raising results in the circle of friends _ from the government level after the initial results of the system, angel teams through less donated goods, but they do not dare to slacken down, anonymous "deployment" and docking materials, will be rapid in the community daily.
有人在群里问，哪里有能给捐献物资打印不干胶的店，邓歌立马推荐了武汉一家印漫画的公司给他；有人找到邓歌想捐赠12台凌光显微镜，想捐给协和、同济等医院，Momo随即帮忙对接了这些医院的相关负责人；有家公司还找到曹杨捐赠了能够提高医务人员免疫力的注射用胸腺肽。
When asked in the group where he could print stickers for donations, Deng recommended to him a Wuhan company that printed caricatures; someone found Deng Ge to donate 12 Lingguang microscopes to hospitals like Concorde and Tongji, and Momo helped dock the hospital directors.
小喻前天晚上高兴得睡不着觉，因为她搞到了一批急缺的酒精资源，昨天就顺利送到了前线，邓歌还给她起了个外号“酒精女王”。
Yu couldn't sleep the night before yesterday because she got a lot of sorely needed supplies of alcohol and arrived at the front yesterday. Dunge also nicknamed her "Queen Alcohol."
曹杨说，她只要在朋友圈发“雷神呼叫”“火神呼叫”的相关资源求助，身边做打印的、做亚克力标识牌的朋友就立马过来找她想要帮忙，“我只能做这个，你帮我问问他们需不需要”。
All she had to do was ask her friends for help with the "Thor Call" or "Fire God Call," and a friend with a print acrylic logo would come to her and ask if they needed it.
▲曹杨朋友圈记载了天使小分队的每一天___跟这些志愿者接触几天下来，就会发现一个事实，这种自发组织产生的参与感和共识感，能够激发很多人对城市本身的认同感。
Cao Yang's circle of friends chronicles the days that Angel Teams meet with these volunteers for a few days and discover the fact that the sense of participation and consensus that this spontaneous organization generates can inspire many people to identify with the city itself.
在Momo的眼里，很多武汉人怕歧视，但并不害怕这次疫情给他们身体带来什么样的危险，“如果有危险的话，不会这么多人不怕死，都出去送物资或者帮别人。
In Momo's eyes, many Wuhan people are afraid of discrimination, but are not afraid of the epidemic to their health, "if there is danger, not so many people are not afraid to die, go out to deliver goods or help others.
”新武汉人小喻说，自己以前也get不到武汉人的幽默点，但现在也算跟这座城的人都是生死之交了。
"The new Wuhan man said he had never been to Wuhan people's humor, but now it's a life-or-death relationship with the city.
胆子很大、执行力又很强的邓歌说，灾难过后他们一定要喝一顿酒，还要为志愿者做一场免费的演出。
DengGe, a brave and effective performer, said they must have a drink after the disaster and give a free performance for the volunteers.
也就是在这个时候，你会发现，这些之前只是共享了「武汉」这个地理位置、但互不关联的个体，因为抗疫的需要，组合在一起，成为了紧密协作的连接体。
It is at this time that you will find that these previously only shared the geographical location of "Wuhan," but not related to each other, because the need to fight the disease, together, has become a closely coordinated connector.
在非正常运行的当下，也许根本就不存在一个精力充沛的、什么都懂的城市管理体系来妥善地处理这些无穷无尽的、千变万化的难题，尤其是在某些环节的工作效率与社会严重脱节的情况下。
At a time of abnormal functioning, there may not be an energetic, all-knowing urban management system to deal properly with these endless and ever-changing challenges, especially when there is a serious disconnect between the efficiency of certain links and society.
Momo这几天都没空看也不想看社交媒体上纷繁复杂的信息了，“政府也好，舆论也好，这些都不是重点，我身边也有朋友被确诊，被隔离，但我们都有心无力，没有办法，但如果说把一线医护人员的安全保证了，大家的安全就都没有问题。
Momo hasn't had time these days to read or read all the complex messages on social media. "Government and public opinion are not the point. I have friends around me who have been diagnosed and quarantined, but there is nothing we can do about it, but if the safety of front-line health workers is assured, no one is safe.
”灾情尤其是规模性的疾病惯于与大城市如影随形，而“城市会因为一些人的腐败而蒙羞”（邓歌语），但对于这些生活于斯的武汉人来说，「不管政府做了什么，人们对自己出生或者成长的地方产生的归属感」，会驱动他们做些什么。
Disasters, especially on a large scale, tend to go hand in hand with big cities, and "cities can be humiliated by the corruption of some" (Deng Ge), but for Wuhan people who live in Si, "whatever the government does, people feel a sense of belonging to where they were born or raised" can drive them to do something.
邓歌说她相信武汉这座城，他们也会“凭着直觉疯狂战斗”。
Dunge said she believed in Wuhan, and that they would "fight crazy on instinct" as well.
