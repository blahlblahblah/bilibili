口述者 新余市渝水区委常委、宣传部部长何智勇整理：胡光华 张青青我和文峰、陈山两位同志经过再三考虑，决定顶住压力，从2月3日晚上9点开始对绿景水岸小区实行全封闭式管理。
Huguang Hua Zhang Qingqing and Comrade Wenfeng and Chen Shan, two comrades, decided to resist the pressure and carry out the full-closed management of the Green View Waterfront District from 9: 00 pm on February 3.
春龙社区绿景水岸小区是新余市疑似“超级传播者”黄某某居住的小区，此前与其接触的13名医护人员均被感染。
Chunlong community green landscape waterfront area is Xinyu City suspected "super disseminator" Huang residential district, previously with contact with 13 medical personnel were infected.
新冠肺炎是一种教科书上未写、现实中从未见过的新型传染病，刚开始大家对该病的毒性、传染性、危险性认识还不是很足，有点懵懵懂懂、不以为然，又恰逢中华民族的传统佳节——春节，人们想走亲戚的就走亲戚，想串门的就串门，没有把它当回事。
New Crown Pneumonia is a new type of infectious disease that has never been written in textbooks and never seen in practice. At first, people do not know enough about the toxicity, infectivity and danger of the disease.
江西新余市渝水区某小区的志愿者服务点。
Volunteer Service Point in Yushui District, Xinyu City, Jiangxi Province.
中新网 图根据江西新余市委市政府的统一部署要求，1月31日晚上，渝水区委召开四套班子新冠肺炎疫情联防联控工作专题会议，针对当前的严峻形势决定对所有小区实行半隔离管理，并对区四套班子领导作了一个责任分工，每个区领导挂点包片一个社区。
According to the unified planning requirements of the municipal government of Xinyu Municipal Committee of Jiangxi Province, on January 31, the Yushui committee held a meeting of four teams to jointly control the new crown pneumonia epidemic.
我牵头挂点包片春龙社区13个小区的疫情防控工作。
I lead the prevention and control of the epidemic in 13 districts of Chunlong community.
2月2日晚上，我们率全市之先，第一个在小区成立了临时党支部，由我担任临时党支部书记，回归党员、市委巡察办主任刘文峰、市委人才办主任陈山、区教体局党委副书记（副局长）肖满珠担任副书记，区委宣传部、区教体局党员干部和春龙社区主任、工作人员作为支部成员，临时党支部对小区防控工作总调度、总协调。
On the evening of February 2, we were the first to set up a temporary Party branch in the district. I was the secretary of the temporary Party branch. Returning Party members, Liu Wenfeng, the head of the CPO, Chen Shan, the Deputy Secretary (Deputy Secretary) of the District Education and Sports Bureau, Xiao Man-chu.
实行全封闭式管理后，临时党支部支部重新排班，24小时在小区门口值守。
After the implementation of full-closed management, the temporary Party branch branch of the shift, 24 hours in front of the cell.
为保障居民封闭期间的日常生活物资供应，2月3日开始，支部安排5名党员志愿者、回归教师每天8时30分，到超市帮居民采购新鲜蔬菜、水果、米、面、油以及各种生活用品，送到20栋楼下，再由物业工作人员逐户送到门口。
In order to ensure the supply of daily necessities during the closure period, five Party members and returning teachers came to the supermarket at 8.30 a.m. on 3 February to help residents purchase fresh vegetables, fruits, rice, noodles, oil and various daily necessities, and transported them to 20 downstairs, where they were taken door to door by property staff.
刚开始实行全封闭管理的时候，有些居民不理解，时不时有小矛盾、小纠纷、小摩擦发生，甚至还有冲卡、谩骂的。
At the beginning of the implementation of the closed management, some residents do not understand, at times there are minor contradictions, minor disputes, minor friction, and even cards, abuse.
但考虑到这样做是为小区居民好，为这座城市好，党员志愿者们也就一忍再忍，愿继续当好“守门神、护航员”。
But considering that this is for the good of the residents of the community, for the good of the city, party members volunteers will endure, willing to continue to be a good "goalkeeper, escort."
在全市第一个实行全封闭式管理2月1日一大早开始，我带领包片帮扶单位区委宣传部、区教体局、区融媒体中心和春龙社区主要负责同志，对13个小区徒步开展调研摸底，了解各个小区疫情防控情况。
In the early morning of February 1, the first in the city to implement full-closed management, I led a package to support the unit's district committee propaganda department, district sports bureau, regional financial media center and Chunlong community leading comrades, to 13 small areas on foot survey and mapping to understand the situation of epidemic prevention and control in each sub-district.
中午1点多钟，我们在社区召开碰头会，把春龙社区疫情防控有关情况进行了分析比较，对3个包片帮扶单位的54名干部进行了具体的分工，分片分小区包干，每个小区指令1名科级干部担任组长，明确各自的任务和职责。
At 1: 00 noon, we held a meeting in the community to analyze and compare the situation of Chunlong community epidemic prevention and control, and made a concrete division of labor among 54 cadres of the three package support units.
绿景水岸小区现有入住居民1300余户共4500余人。
The Green View Waterfront Area currently accommodates more than 1,300 households with more than 4,500 residents.
小区实行半隔离后，2月2日至3日，我们一直在小区门口密切观察值守：虽然实行了半隔离，但进出车辆跟往常一样车水马龙，人员进出也像逛超市一样，居民总有各种理由进进出出，有些居民压根不把疫情当回事。
From 2 to 3 February, after the semi-isolation of the neighbourhood, we kept a close watch on our doorstep: despite the semi-isolation, the traffic was as busy as ever, people were like supermarkets, residents had every reason to move in and out, and some residents simply did not take the outbreak seriously.
这样下去肯定不行。
It's not gonna work this way.
我和文峰、陈山两位同志经过再三考虑，决定顶住压力，从2月3日晚上9点开始对小区实行全封闭式管理，车子只允许出不准进，出去了的车子就只能停在外面，有疫情防控任务和工作需要的居民必须凭单位证明和身份证出入，其他居民则按出入证每户每两天安排一人出去采购生活必需物资，进出小区的居民都必须进行体温检测登记。
After much deliberation, Comrade Wenfeng and Comrade Chen Shan decided to resist the pressure to open up the small area from 9: 00 p.m. on February 3. Only vehicles allowed out of the car can only park outside, residents with disease prevention and control tasks and work needs to show unit certificates and identity cards, other residents every two days to purchase necessities of life, residents in and out of the community must undergo a temperature check registration.
很快，车流量就大大减少。
Soon, traffic was greatly reduced.
2月6日晚上，临时党支部几位同志商量干脆“一刀切”，禁止一切车辆进出。
On the night of February 6, several comrades in the temporary Party branch discussed simply "one size fits all" and banned all vehicles from entering or leaving.
非常时期采取非常手段非常措施严管严控，我们认为方向应该不会错，也是对上级党组织负责，对居民群众负责。
Exceptional means extraordinary measures strict control, we believe that the direction should not be wrong, but also responsible to the higher Party organizations, responsible to the residents.
实行全封闭式管理后，临时党支部支部重新排班，确保24小时都有人在小区门口值守。
After the implementation of full-closed management, temporary Party branch branches rescheduled to ensure that 24-hour people in front of the cell.
2月3日晚上开始，我带头每天坚持值守晚上8点至12点的晚班。
From the evening of February 3, I took the lead in keeping an evening shift from 8 p.m. to 12 p.m. every day.
刚开始实行全封闭管理的时候，有些居民不理解，党员志愿者们苦口婆心解释劝导，还是时不时有小矛盾、小纠纷、小摩擦发生，甚至还有冲卡、谩骂的。
At the beginning of the practice of total closure, some residents did not understand, party volunteers painstakingly explain persuasion, or occasionally minor disputes, skirmishes, and even cards and invective.
有的说，“别的小区都没这么严，你们凭什么管这么紧。
Some said, "The other small areas are not so strict, you on what basis so tight.
”有的说，“我要去菜地里拔点菜，吃点新鲜的。
"Some say," I'm going to the vegetable plot to pick up some fresh food.
”有的说，“我每天都要去北湖公园散步，这是多年的老习惯。
"Some said," I go for a walk in North Lake Park every day.
”……但考虑到这样做是为小区居民好，为这座城市好，党员志愿者们也就一忍再忍、忍气吞声，继续充当守门神、护航员。
... "But considering that it was for the good of the neighborhood and the city, the volunteer party members endured and endured, continuing to serve as goalkeepers and escorts.
对疑似“超级传播者”居住楼栋隐患再排查绿景水岸小区20栋是新余市疑似“超级传播者”黄某某居住的楼栋，该栋共有居民42户163人。
Suspected "super-disseminator" residential buildings hidden danger and check the green landscape waterfront area 20 is Xinyu City suspected "super communicator" Huang residential building, a total of 42 households 163.
根据上级部署，1月29日对该楼栋实行了全封闭式管理。
On the basis of the superior's deployment, the building was fully closed on 29 January.
2月2日下午，市里主要领导来到小区暗访，发现小区20栋居民居家隔离还存在管理漏洞，虽然楼栋进出大门锁住了，但居民可以乘坐电梯从地下车库进出。
February 2 afternoon, the city's main leaders came to the community unannounced visit, found that there are 20 residential isolated management loopholes, although the building access door locked, but residents can access the underground garage by elevator.
得知这一情况后，临时党支部会同社区主任、物业经理第一时间处理，本想找个电焊工把地下车库的门封死，但时值春节，又听说是“超级传播者”居住的楼栋，找了几个师傅都不敢来不愿来，最后还是找到经常帮区委宣传部维修的何师傅，才送来了一把大锁，把地下车库的通道完全锁死。
Upon learning of this, the temporary Party branch, together with the community director and property manager, first tried to find a welder to seal up the underground garage door, but when the Spring Festival, heard that the "super communicators" live in the building, found a few Shifu, often to help the district propaganda department repair, before sending a large lock, the underground garage passageway completely locked.
2月3日晚上10点多钟，收到市里主要领导批示的舆情快报，说有网民反映20栋1702住户是在湖北做生意的，有一辆湖北牌照的车子停在楼下，存在疫情安全隐患。
February 3 more than 10 p.m., received the city's main leadership order of the public opinion express, said that there are netizens reported 20 1702 households in Hubei business, there is a Hubei license plate parked downstairs, there is an epidemic security risk.
获知这一情况后，在市政府何副市长调度指挥下，我带领支部的同志迅速协调街道、社区干部、物业经理、公安民警组成调查小组，于2月4日上午对1702室业主的基本情况进行了上门摸底。
Having been informed of this, and under the direction of Deputy Mayor He of the Municipality, I led the comrades of the branch to coordinate quickly the formation of investigation teams composed of street and community cadres, property managers and public security police.
根据交警部门提供的信息和上门了解到的情况得悉，1702室一家三口都在新余工作，2019年购买了一辆湖北牌照的车，一直在新余行驶，从没去过湖北，更没去过武汉。
According to the information provided by the traffic police and the information received at the door, the family of 1702 is working in the new spare time. In 2019, they bought a car with Hubei license plate and have been driving in Xinyu. They have never been to Hubei or Wuhan.
虽然几经折腾，但大家悬着的一颗心也总算放下了。
Although after several toss, but everyone hanging on a heart also finally laid down.
为做好20栋42户居民的隔离管理，2月4日开始，6名志愿者值守在20栋楼下，每5个小时轮一个班，防止极个别不自觉的居民趁物业人员开门运送物资、收集垃圾时溜出楼栋，杜绝任何病毒传播隐患。
Starting on 4 February, six volunteers were placed on 20 floors and on a five-hour shift to prevent very few unwitting residents from sneaking out of the building while property personnel opened doors to deliver goods and collect garbage, so as to prevent any potential transmission of the virus.
全封闭管理后，小区居民的车子出来了不能进都停在外面，刚开始有点乱停乱放，横七竖八地挤在小区大门口、周边人行道上，连小区消防通道都堵住了。
After the total closure of the management, the residents of the neighborhood cars out can not enter and stop outside, just a little random at the beginning of a bit scattered in front of the neighborhood, the sidewalk around the block, even the district fire passageway.
看到这一现象，我打电话请求市交警支队袁支队长支持，2月4日上午，支队安排交警对小区门口车辆进行了清场整顿，冒雨在小区门口安装了4个护栏，防止车子乱停乱放，保障了小区消防通道的畅通，并从4日下午开始，支队专门派了两名交警蹲在绿景水岸小区门口值守。
On the morning of February 4, the detachment arranged for the traffic police to carry out a clean-up of the vehicles at the gate of the sub-district. In the morning of February 4, the detachment arranged for the traffic police to clean up the traffic.
经过一个星期的严管严控，我们慢慢稳住了阵脚，小区车流、人流明显下降，不管是居民出入体温监测登记，还是外面车子停放，都变得井然有序。
After a week of strict control, we slowly stabilized the field, the flow of cars, traffic significantly reduced, whether residents access the temperature monitoring register, or parked outside the car has become orderly.
针对20栋42户163名全隔离居民，临时党支部用心用情保障他们的日常生活物资供应。
The temporary Party branch has taken great care to ensure the daily supply of goods and materials for 20 families living in total isolation.
2月3日开始，支部安排5名党员志愿者、回归教师每天8时30分，到超市帮他们采购新鲜蔬菜、水果、米、面、油以及各种生活用品，送到20栋楼下，再由物业工作人员逐户送到门口。
Beginning on 3 February, the branch arranged for five volunteer Party members and returning teachers to the supermarket at 8.30 a.m. each day to help them purchase fresh vegetables, fruits, rice, flour, oil and various household items, which were sent to 20 downstairs and then delivered to the door by property staff.
这支红马甲“菜篮子”小分队，每天一大早拿着从物业处打印好的20栋居民在微信群里接龙的购物订单，多则十七八户，少则五六户，赶到超市里对着单子一样一样选购，一户一户分袋装好，一户一户垫钱买单，一遍一遍对照订单清点物资，生怕少买忘买点什么，每天都要在熙熙攘攘的超市里花上两三个小时，在这个最忌讳聚集的非常时期，他们都很勇敢，他们的奉献精神令我感动，也深深打动了20栋42户居民。
This red vest "basket" team, early in the morning with 20 residents printed from the property to pick up dragon shopping orders, as well as a small number of 56 households, to the supermarket as well as separate bags, pay the bill, the purchase orders over and over again, in this most taboo Shopping Mall, I am moved by their dedication and moved by 20 42 families.
其实，采购物资只是红马甲“菜篮子”小分队党员志愿者们的工作之一，他们每天帮居民采购完，还要参加小区的值班值守，同时兼顾自己的手头工作。
In fact, the procurement of supplies is just one of the jobs of the volunteers in the red vest "basket" who help residents with their shopping every day and participate in the watch in the neighborhood while taking care of their jobs.
如区委宣传部新闻股的张青青同志，采购完后马上又要赶到单位做好疫情新闻宣传、舆情监控处置工作；区委宣传部办公室的晏小莉同志每天晚上还要值守8点到12点的晚班。
For example, Comrade Zhang Qingqing of the Information Unit of the Publicity Department of the District Committee will rush to the unit immediately after the purchase to do a good job in publicizing the epidemic situation and monitoring and handling public opinion.
除了生活物资上的保障，我们还非常关注隔离居民的心理疏导。
In addition to living and material security, we are also very concerned about the isolation of the residents psychological counseling.
刚开始进驻小区的时候，我就请春龙社区何六英主任把我拉进20栋居民的微信交流群。
Just began to enter the community, I asked Chunlong community director He Liying to pull me into 20 residential micro-communication groups.
一方面，在群里积极开展交流，传递市委市政府、区委区政府最新疫情防控措施，传递一些正能量的信息，跟他们互动交流，给大家打气提振信心；另一方面，号召20栋42户163名居民里的中共党员通过接龙形式亮明身份，发现共有24名中共党员。
On the one hand, they have actively exchanged information on the latest epidemic prevention and control measures of the municipal and district governments of the municipal governments, conveyed some positive energy information, interacted with them and encouraged them to strengthen their confidence. On the other hand, the CPC members of the 163 residents of 20 families were called upon to identify themselves in the form of dragons and found 24 CPC members.
2月5日以来，24名中共党员在群里起了一个很好的模范带头作用，他们在群里做了很多解疑释惑的工作，引导大家凝心聚力共克时艰，比如504的张小流、1401的廖志平、1404的刘燕波……面对新冠肺炎疫情的肆虐横行，临时党支部充分发挥了战斗堡垒作用，广大党员干部志愿者充分发挥了先锋模范作用。
Since February 5, 24 CPC members have played a leading and exemplary role in the group. They have done a lot of puzzling work in the group, such as Zhang Xiaoliu of 504, Liao Zhiping of 1401, Liu Yanbo of 1404.
