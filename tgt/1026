武汉正在该市蔡甸区职工疗养院，紧急设计建设一个有1000个床位的临时医院，用于集中收治新型冠状病毒肺炎患者。
Wuhan is in the Cai Den staff sanatorium in the city, urgent design and construction of a 1000-bed temporary hospital for the treatment of patients with new coronavirus pneumonia.
临时医院计划在2月3日前投入使用。
The temporary hospital is scheduled to be operational by 3 February.
这是学“小汤山模式”。
This is learning the "Xiaotangshan Model."
2003年，北京7天建成小汤山医院，接收680名非典病人，其中672人康复出院，8人不幸去世，治愈率接近99%，而且1383名医护人员零感染。
In 2003, the Xiaotangshan Hospital was built in Beijing in 7 days and received 680 SARS patients, 672 of whom were rehabilitated and discharged, 8 of whom died tragically, with a cure rate of nearly 99 per cent, and 1,383 medical personnel were infected with the disease.
小汤山对不同的患者进行个体化治疗，最关键环节是确认何时需要加大药物剂量，何时需要使用特效激素。
The most important part of Xiaotangshan's individualized treatment of different patients is to identify when to increase the dosage of the drug and when to use the specific hormone.
医院严格区分了为医务人员的区域、病人的区域、后勤保障的区域，并建立严格且细致的制度，以此减少感染的可能。
Hospitals make a strict distinction between areas for medical staff, areas for patients and areas for logistical support, and establish strict and meticulous systems to reduce the likelihood of infection.
时任小汤山医院院长张雁灵说，如果没有小汤山医院，北京至少还要增加2000至3000名非典病人，至少还要再死200人以上。
Without the hospital, Beijing would have at least 2,000 to 3,000 more SARS patients and at least 200 more dead, said Zhang Yanling, then director of Xiaotangshan Hospital.
武汉也要建一个“小汤山医院”了，作为收治新型冠状病毒肺炎患者的定点医院。
Wuhan will also build a "Xiaotangshan Hospital", as the admission of patients with new coronavirus pneumonia point hospital.
1月23日消息，武汉市政集团接到紧急任务，在武汉市蔡甸区职工疗养院的项目征地上，建一个70亩地（2.5万平方米），有1000个床位的临时医院，预计6天完工。
On January 23, Wuhan Municipal Government Group was given an urgent task to build a 70-acre (25,000 square meters) temporary 1,000-bed hospital on the project of Cai Den sanatorium in Wuhan city, which is expected to be completed in six days.
医疗设备于2月1日开始穿插安装。
The installation of medical equipment began on 1 February.
临时医院计划在2月3日前投入使用。
The temporary hospital is scheduled to be operational by 3 February.
临时医院由中建三局承建，武汉中信设计院被紧急召回，需要24小时内出图。
The temporary hospital was built by China Construction Bureau, Wuhan Zhongxin Design Institute was recalled emergency, need 24 hours to produce a map.
1月23日晚，武汉中信设计院设计人员已经连夜加班赶图。
On the night of January 23, Wuhan Zhongxin Design Institute designers have been working overtime overnight map.
截至1月23日24时，国家卫生健康委收到29个省（区、市）累计报告新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎确诊病例830例，其中重症177例，死亡25例，其中湖北省24例、河北省1例。
As of 2400 hours January 23, the National Health Council had received a total of 830 confirmed cases of pneumonia with new coronavirus infection in 29 provinces (districts and municipalities), of which 177 were severe cases and 25 deaths, including 24 in Hubei Province and 1 in Hebei Province.
已治愈出院34例。
Thirty-four cases were cured.
20个省（区、市）累计报告疑似病例1072例。
A total of 1,072 suspected cases were reported in 20 provinces, districts and municipalities.
其中1月23日一天，27个省（区、市）报告新增确诊病例259例，新增死亡患者8例。
On January 23, 259 new confirmed cases and 8 new deaths were reported in 27 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities.
新增治愈出院6例。
Six new cases were cured and discharged.
19个省（区、市）报告新增疑似病例680例。
Nineteen provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities reported 680 new suspected cases.
疫情还处于上升期。
The epidemic is still on the rise.
2003年，小汤山医院也是在北京SARS疫情最严峻的时期动工的，并被认为是疫情防控的一个转折点。
In 2003, Xiaotangshan Hospital was also built at the height of the SARS epidemic in Beijing and was considered a turning point in the prevention and control of the disease.
那是2003年4月下旬。
That was late April 2003.
4月20日，王岐山出任北京市代理市长，国务院副总理吴仪兼任卫生部长，高强任卫生部党组书记。
On April 20, Wang Qishan became Acting Mayor of Beijing, Vice Premier Wu Yi was also Minister of Health and Gao Qiang was Secretary of the Ministry of Health.
而北京确诊非典病例从19日的37例猛增至339例，并在随后的几天里继续以每天超过100例的速度增长，到了30日，已达到1440例。
The number of confirmed SARS cases in Beijing jumped from 37 on the 19th to 339, and continued to rise by more than 100 a day in the next few days, reaching 1,440 on the 30th.
患者猛增的同时，医护人员也在不断被感染，30日累计的1440例病例中，包含医护人员270例。
While the number of cases has soared, medical staff have been constantly infected, including 270 out of a total of 1,440 cases over the past 30 days.
最严重的北京大学附属人民医院，共93名医护人员被感染，不得不于4月24日封院。
The Peking University affiliated People's Hospital, the deadliest of all, had to close on April 24 after a total of 93 staff were infected.
当时北京收治SARS病人的医院全线告急，病床缺口1500到2000张。
The hospital housing SARS patients in Beijing was in crisis, with a shortage of 1,500 to 2,000 beds.
小汤山医院院长张雁灵后来接受采访时说，“当时给我的感觉是很可怕，病人已经多到了没有地方容纳的地步，甚至治疗病人的医生也在不断倒下。
"It was a terrible feeling," Zhang Yanling, director of the Xiaotangshan Hospital, said later in an interview. "The number of patients was so high that there was no room for them.
”但也是在4月30日，转折点来了。
But it was also on April 30 that the turning point came.
4月22日才批复、23日才动工的小汤山医院在这一天开始接收病人了。
Xiaotangshan Hospital, which was only given a reply on 22 April and began construction on 23 April, began receiving patients on that day.
从这一天开始到6月20日，小汤山医院接收680名非典病人，是全球病例的十分之一、中国病例的七分之一，其中672人康复出院。
From that date until 20 June, Xiaotangshan Hospital received 680 SARS patients, one tenth of the global cases and one seventh of the cases in China, 672 of whom recovered and were discharged.
堪称奇迹的是，参与治疗和护理的1383名医护人员没有一人被感染。
Miraculously, none of the 1,383 health-care workers who participated in treatment and care were infected.
△图片来源：《回望小汤山》截图临危受命，7天建成的传染病医院小汤山医院原本是一座疗养院，建设为SARS定点医院是临危受命。
2007-9-25 21: 48 Xiao Tang Shan Hospital, a 7-day-old infectious disease hospital, was built as a sanatorium. The building of a designated hospital for SARS was an imminent threat.
2003年4月22日，在北京防治非典工作联席会议上，疾控中心的专家建议，医院已经不够用了，可以考虑征用疗养院，比如条件比较好的小汤山疗养院。
On April 22, 2003, at the Beijing Joint Conference on SARS Prevention and Control, CDC experts suggested that hospitals were no longer adequate and that nursing homes, such as the relatively good Xiaotangshan Sanatorium, should be considered.
卫生部副部长朱庆生和北京市副市长刘敬民随即前往小汤山，和专家在实地勘察之后发现，小汤山是一块建设新医院的好地方——它离最近的居民点500米，虽然疗养院本身只有200张床位，可是旁边有一大片预留的发展用地，而且它四周环境空旷，便于机械化的施工。
Vice Minister of Health Zhu Qingsheng and Beijing's deputy mayor Liu Jingmin immediately went to Xiaotangshan, and experts found that the new hospital is a good place to build a new hospital - 500 meters from the nearest settlement.
另外京密引水渠在小汤山疗养院北面4公里处，污水可以经过专门处理，不会影响到北京市的水源。
In addition, the Jingmi Aqueduct is located 4 km north of the Xiaotangshan Sanatorium. The sewage can be treated specially and will not affect Beijing's water supply.
于是，军地双方一拍即合，新建的传染病医院选址小汤山，决策、研究、勘察、拍板到开工，一天之内完成。
Therefore, the two sides clap together, the new infectious disease hospital site Xiaotangshan, decision-making, research, survey, beat board to start, within a day to complete.
4月23日到4月30日，7000多工人经过了七天七夜的紧急施工，能够容纳1000张床位的小汤山非典定点医院建成了。
Between April 23 and April 30, more than 7,000 workers underwent seven days and seven nights of emergency construction, and the 1,000-bed Xiaotangshan SARS designated hospital was completed.
与此同时，来自全国各大军区114所医院的1383名医护人员，陆续进驻。
At the same time, 1,383 medical personnel from 114 hospitals in the country's major military regions have been deployed.
张雁灵4月29日才接到担任小汤山医院的通知，之前他是白求恩军医学院院长，当时正在国防大学进修。
Zhang received notification of his appointment as director of the Xiaotangshan Hospital on April 29, while studying at the National Defense University.
当他和搭档小汤山医院政委徐达穗离开国防大学时，他回头看了看校门，徐半开玩笑半认真地问：“张院长，你看什么呀，是不是怕回不来了啊！”这个问题，对所有奉命前往小汤山医院的医护人员都是一个未知数。
When he left the National Defense University with his partner, Xu Dashoe, a political commissar of Xiaotangshan Hospital, he looked back at the gate and asked half jokingly, "Dean Zhang, are you afraid that he won't be able to get back?"
怎么样才能提高患者治愈率、确保医护人员零感染？△图片来源：《回望小汤山》截图对不同患者进行个体化治疗7天建成的小汤山医院给患者的第一感知是偏僻的几排平房。
How can we improve the cure rate of patients and ensure no infectionPhotograph: Looking back on Xiaotangshan, the seven-day-old Xiaotangshan Hospital gives patients a first glimpse of the isolated rows of bungalows.
张雁灵在《回望小汤山》中写道，有的病人下车后死死抓住车把手，一位40多岁的女患者，下了车就靠着墙哭：“这是医院吗？是正规治疗吗？你们能治好我的病吗？为什么把我们弄到荒郊野外？是不是‘死亡集中营’？是不是拿我们做‘731试验’？”把充满疑虑的病人劝到病房不难，但怎么治好他们的病就是一个难题。
Some patients got off the bus and grabbed the handles. A woman in her 40s was leaning against the wall, crying: "Is this the hospital? Is it formal treatment? Can you cure me? Can you get us to a death camp? Is it easy to persuade suspicious patients to the ward?
张雁灵回忆，有媒体很直率地问我：小汤山医院这样一所类似野战化条件的医院，能有信心和把握救治好非典患者吗……谁都知道：非典没有特效药。
The media asked me very bluntly: Can a hospital like Xiaotangshan Hospital, similar to the field conditions, have the confidence and grasp to treat SARS patients... everyone knows that SARS has no specific medicine.
据《回望小汤山》记载，680名非典患者刚入院时，发热的占98%以上，其中持续38摄氏度以上的占48%；高龄患者113名，患者中年龄最大的79岁，最小的却只有13岁；所有病人肺部病变和临床症状非常明显，且大多数处于病变发展期，传染性强，危险性大。
According to "Looking Back at Xiaotangshan," 680 SARS patients were admitted to hospital with fever of 98 percent or more, including 48 percent who lasted 38 degrees Celsius or more. There were 113 elderly patients, the oldest of whom were 79 years old and the youngest was only 13.
有外电曾评论说：小汤山医院就是中国的SARS病毒库，说不定哪天就会突然爆炸。
Xiao Tangshan Hospital is China's SARS virus bank, which may explode one day, said a foreign newspaper.
为了提供有效的治疗，医院从各军区医院抽调34位教授组成救治专家指导组和救治咨询专家组，改变过去三级查房的一贯做法，直接分工每位专家与2至4个临床科室挂钩，采取集体会诊、下病区查房等相结合的方式，最大效能发挥专家教授的救治作用，对不同的患者进行个体化治疗。
In order to provide effective treatment, the hospital has drawn 34 professors from the military area hospitals to form the guidance group of treatment specialists and the treatment advisory expert group.
医院根据国家卫生部下发的非典治疗指导方案，结合国内外治疗非典的成功经验，又成立了由21名专家教授组成的，涉及消化、心内、肾内、泌尿、耳鼻咽喉等16个专业的基础疾病专家会诊组，注重抓好非典患者基础疾病的诊治和危重患者的救治，先后成功探索出“早干预、重支持、抗感染、慎激素、调心理、勤观察”的“小汤山综合治疗方案”，研制出针对不同患者的“非典一号方”、“非典二号方”、“非典三号方”。
Based on the SARS Treatment Guidance Program issued by the Ministry of Public Health and the successful experience of treating SARS at home and abroad, the hospital has set up a team of 21 specialists in the field of basic diseases, such as digestion, intracardiac, intrarenal, urinary, otorhinopharyngeal treatment.
其中最关键的环节是何时需要加大药物剂量，何时需要使用特效激素甲泼尼龙。
The most critical link is when you need to increase the dosage and when you need to use the specific hormone methylprednylon.
SARS病毒不仅对人的身体器官造成严重损害，而且对患者的心理带来很大创伤。
SARS virus not only causes serious damage to human body organs, but also brings great psychological trauma to the patients.
小汤山医院收治的患者中，有70多人入院之初就产生过轻生的念头，有些不但不配合治疗，还打骂医护人员，甚至揭医护人员的口罩。
More than 70 patients admitted to Xiaotangshan Hospital developed light-hearted feelings at the beginning of their admission. Some of them did not cooperate with treatment, but also beat and cursed medical personnel and even uncovered their masks.
为了帮助他们治疗，医院也成立了心理咨询中心。
Psychological counselling centres have also been set up in hospitals to help them with their treatment.
最终，入院患者中，除8人因多种并发症不治死亡，其余全部康复出院，治愈率接近99%。
In the end, all but eight of the hospitalized patients recovered from multiple complications and were discharged, with treatment rates approaching 99 per cent.
医护人员零感染的背后提高治愈率之外，医护人员可能面临的感染是另一项艰巨的挑战。
In addition to increasing cure rates behind zero infections among health-care workers, the infections that health-care workers may face are another daunting challenge.
据后来的统计，非典期间中国内地累计病例5327例,医护人员占20%左右；死亡349人，医护人员差不多占三分之一。
According to statistics, during the SARS period, China had a total of 5,327 cases, with medical staff accounting for about 20 percent of the total.
“市里的医院接待能力有限，消毒设备也不完备，会导致病毒进一步的传播。
"The city's hospitals have limited capacity and inadequate disinfection equipment, which can lead to further spread of the virus.
”北京小汤山医院一位老员工这样形容当时防控疫情所面临的尴尬处境。
An old employee at Beijing's Xiaotangshan Hospital described the embarrassment of preventing and controlling the outbreak at the time.
而紧急建成的小汤山医院，“防护基本以物理隔离为主，严格区分了为医务人员的区域、病人的区域、后勤保障的区域，以此减少感染的可能。
The emergency construction of Xiaotangshan Hospital, "protection is basically physical isolation, strict distinction for medical staff areas, patient areas, logistics areas, so as to reduce the possibility of infection.
”整个院区被分为三块，新建成的病区是控制区，医护人员的居住区域是缓冲区域，行政和后勤的办公区域是清洁区，各个区域的人员分区活动，防止污染的扩散。
The entire compound is divided into three parts, the newly constructed area is controlled area, the area of residence of the medical staff is the buffer zone, the administrative and logistical office area is the cleaning zone, the area of personnel zoning activities in the regions and the prevention of the spread of pollution.
而在病区内则采取了更为严格的隔离防护措施。
Stricter quarantine measures have been taken in the affected areas.
病房、医护人员、物品等严格分开，病房设有双层玻璃的送饭口，病人和医护人员的通道也各不相同，病人是通过病房门前半开放式的走廊通道进出病房，而医护人员则是从专用的工作通道进出。
Wards, medical staff, articles and so on are strictly separated, the wards are equipped with double-glazed food delivery ports, patients and medical staff have different access, patients enter and leave the ward through the semi-open corridor in front of the ward, and medical staff enter and leave the ward through dedicated working passages.
工作人员从清洁区到病房污染区，要经过几道的消毒，三次更衣。
Staff from the clean area to the contaminated areas of the ward, to go through several disinfection, three changes of clothing.
△ 双层玻璃的送饭口，图片来源：凤凰卫视视频截图为保护医院周围的环境不受污染，医院专门新建了污水处理站。
2007-9-25 21: 48 A new sewage disposal station has been built to protect the environment around the hospital from pollution.
病人的衣服、床单出来了以后先通过环氧乙烷消毒，消毒以后才拿去清洗，清洗后的水再进入到污水站处理。
After the patient's clothes, bedclothes come out through ethylene oxide disinfect, disinfect then take to wash, the water after cleaning re-enter sewage station to deal with.
此外还有专门的垃圾处理装置对废弃物进行焚烧处理。
In addition, waste is incinerated by dedicated waste disposal units.
当然，加急建成的小汤山医院仍然存在问题，根据《非典十周年祭》的记录，病房设计和内部结构离现实需要还有很大差距，个别病房窗户还没有安装，病床缺的很多，有的病区门甚至还锁不上，下水道堵塞，尤其令人担心的是，隔离病房的密封性不够，容易造成医护人员感染。
Of course, the accelerated construction of the Xiaotangshan Hospital still has problems. According to the records of the Tenth Anniversary of SARS, the ward design and internal structure are still far from the reality. Individual ward windows are not installed, beds are scarce, some doors are not even locked and sewers are blocked.
但“防护条件比其他市里的医院好”。
But "the protection is better than hospitals in other cities."
物理隔离条件只是一个基础，更重要的是医护人员操作过程如何避免感染。
Physical isolation is only a foundation, and more important is how health care workers operate to avoid infection.
据《回望小汤山》所载，医院出台了《院内预防感染工作规则》、《出入流程》、《防护守则》，共计3章24节，约8000字，印刷成46页的小册子，全院人手一册。
According to "Looking back at Xiaotangshan," the hospital issued "Hospital Rules for Prevention of Infection," "Access Procedures," "Protection Code," a total of 3 chapters 24 words, about 8,000 words, printed into a 46-page booklet, the whole hospital in a book.
包含了医护人员的防护穿戴、与病人的交谈距离、洗手要达到3分钟、会议要在室外、洗澡流程、清洁程序、垃圾处理条例、生活区行为守则等等。
These include protective clothing for medical staff, distance from the patient, washing hands for up to 3 minutes, meetings outside, bathing procedures, cleaning procedures, waste disposal regulations, code of conduct for the living area, etc.
甚至包括交通规则：医护人员在各区之间的行走路线，在污染区面对面行走时如何避让等等。
It even includes traffic rules: how health care workers travel from one area to another, how to avoid giving in when walking face to face in polluted areas, etc.
还规定：违反者将受到通报批评，严重者以军法惩处。
It also provides that violators will be criticized by notification and, in serious cases, punished by military law.
医院甚至与各大单位带队领导、各病区主任、护士长签订《预防院内感染军令状》，明确规定履行了如何奖励，违反了如何惩罚，明示“如果发生感染，就地免职；退回原单位”。
The hospital even signed a Military Writ of Prevention of Hospital Infection with the leaders of the major units, the directors of the respective disease areas and the head nurse, specifying how the reward was fulfilled and how the punishment was violated, stating that "in the event of infection, dismissal on the spot; return to the original unit."
为了监督医护人员遵守制度，医院设立专职督导员，负责时时、处处监控所有人员，包括防护服怎么穿、口罩怎么戴、眼罩怎么戴、出污染区怎么摘手套等等具体而细致的环节。
In order to monitor compliance by health-care personnel, hospitals have special supervisors who monitor all personnel at all times and at all times, including how protective clothing is worn, how masks are worn, how blindfolds are worn and how gloves are removed from contaminated areas.
在软硬件都进行特殊对待下，小汤山医院真的做到1383名医护人员零感染。
Under the special treatment of hardware and software, Xiaotangshan Hospital really achieved 1383 medical personnel zero infection.
6月23日清晨，小汤山首批900名医疗队员从北京撤离。
The first 900 medical personnel were evacuated from Beijing in the early morning hours of June 23.
一天后，世界卫生组织在日内瓦总部宣布，北京从SARS疫区名单中删除。
A day later, the World Health Organization announced at its headquarters in Geneva that Beijing had been removed from the list of SARS affected areas.
小汤山康复医院的一位原副院长回忆起这段经历，忙的时候连轴转，到最后一天，觉得就像是卸掉了一个重任，“终于结束了。
One of the former vice-deans of Xiaotangshan Rehabilitation Hospital recalled the experience, running around in a hurry until on the last day it felt as if an important task had been discharged and "it is over.
”张雁灵在书中写道，2003年5月26日，北京组织召开的非典定点医院院长会议上，时任北京市代市长王岐山对他说：“自从小汤山开始收治病人，北京市的老百姓心里就踏实了”。
'Since Xiaotangshan started treating patients, the people of Beijing have taken comfort in their hearts, 'Wang Qishan, then acting mayor of Beijing, told the dean of the SARS designated hospital on May 26, 2003 in Beijing.
△图片来源：《回望小汤山》截图张雁灵还在书中引用了一句话：“有专家断言，如果没有小汤山医院，北京至少还要增加2000至3000名非典病人，至少还要再死200人以上”。
"Experts have claimed that without the Xiaotangshan Hospital, Beijing would have to add at least 2,000 to 3,000 SARS patients and at least 200 more deaths," Zhang Yanling, the author of the book, said in a statement.
