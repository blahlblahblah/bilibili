澎湃新闻记者 汤琪那个让全网动容的九旬“硬核奶奶”，如今已得知自己照顾了五天五夜的六旬儿子因新冠肺炎离世的消息。
The journalist Tommy, the 90-year-old "hard-core grandmother," who moved the net, has now learned that her 60-year-old son, who had been caring for five days and five nights, died of pneumonia.
澎湃新闻2月8日曾发表一篇题为《口述丨九旬老人看护六旬染病儿子，是什么支撑起她的“硬核”》的报道，聚焦了一位来自武汉的九旬老人。
Pai Pai News published a report on February 8 entitled "Oral rules into the hands of a 60-year-old son, what underpins her" hard core, "focusing on a 90-year-old man from Wuhan.
她名叫徐美武，其64岁的儿子不幸感染新冠肺炎，在医院门诊部历经五天五夜才等来一个床位，却因病情加重住进ICU。
Her 64-year-old son, whose name is Xu Mei-wu, was admitted to the ICU after five days and five nights in the hospital clinic waiting for a bed.
事实上，早在上述报道发布以前，澎湃新闻已经从武汉协和医院（华中科技大学同济医学院附属协和医院）的一名林姓医生处了解到，徐美武的儿子在更早以前已经不幸离世。
Indeed, long before the report was published, the news surged from a doctor surnamed Lin at Wuhan Hsiao He Hospital, an affiliate of Tongji Medical School at Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
3月10日，林医生在微博上发表一篇题为《对不起，我撒了个谎》的长文，详细记叙了他与徐美武老人相遇的经过。
On March 10, Dr. Lin posted a long article on Weibo entitled "Sorry, I lied," detailing his encounter with Xu Mei-wu.
截屏图一封永远无法抵达的信据林医生透露，他在2月3日凌晨2点遇到了徐美武，老人为了不让其他家庭成员被感染，主动承担起照顾当时就被确诊为新冠肺炎的64岁儿子的重担，直到儿子住进病房了，她才能独自一人来门诊找医生做CT检查。
Screen screenshot An unreachable letter According to Dr Lin, he met Xu Meiwu on February 3 at 2: 00 am. He volunteered to take care of his 64-year-old son, who had been diagnosed with pneumonia at the time, until he was in the hospital room.
林医生在上述文章中写道，在等待结果出来的时候，徐美武找护士借了纸和笔，写下了感动无数网友的一段留言：“儿子，要挺住，要坚强，战胜病魔。
"While waiting for the results to come out, Xu Mei-wu borrowed some paper and pens and wrote a message that touched countless netizens:" Son, hang on, be strong and overcome the disease
要配合医生治疗，呼吸器不舒服，要忍一忍，以便恢复。
To cooperate with the doctor treatment, breathing apparatus is uncomfortable, must endure for a while, in order to recover.

忘记给现金，托医生带上伍佰元，可托人买日常用品。
Forgetting to pay cash, the doctor entrusted with five hundred yuan to buy daily necessities.
”徐美武曾告诉澎湃新闻，儿子2月3日送进抢救室之后，家属没办法再一直陪在身边了，情急之下，她向护士借了笔，想着给儿子写封信，让他可以宽心治疗。
Xu told Pong Pai News that after her son was taken to the emergency room on February 3, her family could not stay with him any longer.
她特别想告诉儿子，妈妈不要他关心，只要他把这条命挺住。
She wanted to tell her son in particular that his mother didn't want him to care as long as he held on.
徐美武说，“因为我和儿子住在一起，又在医院一直密切接触了五天五夜，现在全家都很担心我是否感染。
"Because I live with my son and have been in close contact with the hospital for five days and nights, the whole family is worried about my infection," Xu said.
我如果做了核酸检测呈阴性，能够活就继续活下去，检测呈阳性对我也无所谓了，我只希望还在抢救中的儿子可以成功转危为安，那样我才更有盼头多活几年。
If I had been tested negative for nucleic acid and could live on, it wouldn't matter to me to be tested positive. I just hope that my son, who is still alive, can make it through, and then I'll have a few more years to live.
哪怕是把房子卖了，我也想把他的命换回来。
Even if I sold the house, I'd trade his life for it.
”后来，徐美武写的那封信没能递到儿子身边。

在2月7日接受澎湃新闻采访时，她还不知道，在她写下信的第二天下午5点40分，她的儿子已经因抢救无效，不幸去世了。
At the time of the news interview on 7 February, she did not know that at 5.40 p.m., the day after she had written the letter, her son had died as a result of the rescue.

@小儿内分泌林医生 图为她“撒谎”的医生2月12日，澎湃新闻从徐美武家属处了解到，徐美武经过核酸检测以后得到阴性结果，已排除感染新冠肺炎，不过由于高龄、低烧，后来一直在医院疗养。
Pediatric Endocrine Lin doctor "liar" doctor February 12, Peng Pai Wu learned from Xu Mei Wu's family that after testing negative nucleic acid results, Xu Meiwu has ruled out new crown pneumonia, but because of advanced age, low fever, has since been in hospital convalescent.
林医生也在微博上表示，当时他就对他的同事们，包括徐奶奶儿子的管床医生交代，千万不要告诉徐奶奶这个残酷的事实，老人家会受不了的。
Dr. Lin also told Weibo that he told his colleagues, including Xu's son's bed-keeper, not to tell Grandma Xu the cruel fact that the elderly people would not be able to bear.
3月9日，林医生向徐美武家属询问老人近况时才获悉，他们家已经把这个沉痛的消息告诉了她，老人备受打击。
On March 9, Dr. Lin asked Xu's family how he was doing when he learned that the family had told her the sad news and the old man had been hit hard.
“之所以选择在今天（3月10日）把这个消息告诉大家，主要是因为已经连续2天，新增确诊病例在100以内了，大家可以稍稍松一口气，也许能接受这个残酷的事实；然后老人家也得知了这个消息，尽管难过，但生活还要继续。
"The main reason for choosing to tell you this today (March 10) is that for the second day in a row the number of newly diagnosed cases is less than 100. You can breathe a little easier and perhaps accept this cruel fact.

"Dr. Lin wrote in a microblog.
