武汉大学中南医院医学影像科副主任张笑春表示，要注意防控，但也不需要太恐慌，更不要歧视康复出院的病人，“我们有的是办法应对。
Zhang Xiaochun, deputy director of medical imaging at Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital, said attention should be paid to prevention and control, but not too much panic, not to mention discrimination against convalescent patients.
”全文4201字，阅读约需8分钟新冠肺炎疫情暴发以来，一些出院患者复查时，病毒核酸检测结果又变为阳性，简称“复阳”。
Since the outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia in about eight minutes, some patients discharged from the hospital have been re-examined and tested positive for viral nucleic acid test, known as Fuyang for short.
“复阳”病例的成因、“复阳”病例是否传染等问题，引发公众高度关注。
The causes of "Fuyang" cases and whether the cases of "Fuyang" are infectious or not have aroused high public concern.
2月28日，国务院联防联控机制召开的新闻发布会上，国家卫生健康委医政医管局监察专员郭燕红表示，暂未发现“复阳”病例传染别人的现象。
On February 28, at a press conference convened by the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council, Guo Yanhong, an inspector in the Hospital Authority of the National Health Council, said no cases of "Fuyang" had been found to spread from person to person.
国家卫健委高级别专家组组长、中国工程院院士钟南山此前表示“复阳”患者是否再传染别人，仍有待观察。
Zhong Nan-shan, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and head of the National Fitness and Health Commission's high-level panel, said earlier that it remains to be seen whether patients reinfect others.
3月5日，武汉大学中南医院医学影像科副主任张笑春告诉新京报记者，各地增加的“复阳”现象，反映出目前新冠肺炎检测技术精度和效率的两难，也反映出医学界对于新冠肺炎病毒仍在加深认识的过程中，“这个过程注定不会容易”。
Zhang Xiaochun, deputy director of the medical imaging department at Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital, told the Beijing News on March 5 that the increase in "Fuyang" in various places reflected the current dilemma of accuracy and efficiency in the detection of new crown pneumonia and the fact that the medical community is still learning more about the new crown pneumonia virus.
张笑春建议，条件成熟时可以采用多点核酸检测、多种检测方案互补的办法，从出院环节和隔离期间着手，遏止“复阳”病例的增加。
Zhang suggested that when conditions are ripe, multi-point nucleic acid detection and a variety of complementary testing methods can be adopted to stop the increase of reyang cases, starting with the discharge link and isolation period.
━━━━━“复阳”可追溯至2月14日最早可查的“复阳”案例可追溯到2月14日，加拿大安大略省的夫妻二人在出院14天后双双“复阳”。
2006-02-14 09: 53: 00 Fuyang Cases Retrieved Feb. 14 The earliest known cases of Fuyang date back to Feb. 14, and couples in Ontario, Canada, were reborn 14 days after being released from the hospital.
他们分别于1月29日及1月31日出院，临床诊断为已经痊愈。
They were discharged on 29 January and 31 January, respectively, and were clinically diagnosed as having recovered.
但出院14天后，两名病例的鼻咽拭子检测结果均为阳性。
However, 14 days after discharge, both patients tested positive for nasopharyngeal swabs.
据各地公开通报，2020年2月中下旬至今，国内有广东、江苏、天津、四川、湖南、湖北等6个省份的疾控部门公布过“复阳”病例通报内容。
From mid-February to the present, the CDC departments in six provinces, including Guangdong, Jiangsu, Tianjin, Sichuan, Hunan and Hubei, have announced the contents of the case report.
此外，加拿大、韩国亦发现“复阳”病例。
In addition, Canada, the Republic of Korea also found "Fuyang" cases.
2月25日，广东省疾控中心副主任宋铁称，广东省内出院患者出现“复阳”现象的比例约14%。
On Feb. 25, Song Tiewei, deputy director of Guangdong's CDC, said about 14 percent of patients discharged from the hospital in Guangdong province had "Fuyang" symptoms.
广州市第八人民医院感染病中心ICU主任李粤平称，他们在对出院病例随访时发现了13例“复阳”患者。
Li Yuping, director of ICU at the 8th People's Hospital Infection Center in Guangzhou, said they found 13 cases of "Fuyang" in follow-up to hospital discharges.
2月28日，新京报记者从江苏省徐州市疾控中心获悉，27日，该市有1例出院病例核酸复检阳性（无症状）。
February 28, the Beijing News reporters from Xuzhou City, Jiangsu Province, the CDC learned that on 27, the city has a case of positive nucleic acid retesting (asymptomatic).
在复检阳性3天前，该病例刚解除隔离归家。
The case had just been released from isolation and returned home three days before retesting positive.
3月1日，海南省政府官网消息，海南首例“复阳”患者再次出院。
The first case of Fuyang in Hainan province was discharged again on March 1, government officials reported on Hainan's official website.
目前其体温已恢复正常5天，咽拭子、粪便核酸连续2次（间隔超24小时）检测均为阴性。
His body temperature has returned to normal for 5 days, pharyngeal swab, fecal nucleic acid two times in a row (more than 24 hours apart) were negative.
2月27日，武汉大学中南医院研究人员发布在国际顶级医学期刊《美国医学会杂志》上的一篇论文，从研究角度揭开“复阳”现象的一角。
Researchers from Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital released a paper in the February 27 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, one of the world's leading medical journals.
论文以4例新冠病毒康复者为观察样本，这4名康复者在出院5至13天后，核酸检测呈阳性。
In this paper, 4 cases of newly recovered Crowne Virus were observed. The 4 recovered patients tested positive for nucleic acid five to 13 days after discharge from hospital.
4人皆为医护人员，疾病的严重程度为轻度至中度，年龄范围为30至36岁。
All four were paramedics with mild to moderate severity, ranging from 30 to 36 years of age.
论文显示，其中一名患者出院前接受过两次核酸检测，结果皆呈阴性，CT也显示其肺部病灶明显吸收好转，因此被安排出院。
The paper showed that one of the patients had received two nucleic acid tests before being discharged from the hospital. Results were negative, and CT showed a marked improvement in the absorption of lung lesions.
该患者出院后接受严格的居家隔离，并持续服用奥斯他韦类药物近一个月。
The patient was released from hospital under strict home isolation and continued to take oseltamivir drugs for nearly a month.
2月初，该患者准备复工前再次接受检查，CT结果显示正常，但首日核酸检测结果呈弱阳性，次日复查结果呈阳性。
At the beginning of February, the patient was again examined before returning to work, and CT findings were normal, but on the first day the nucleic acid test was weak positive and the following day the results were positive.
研究人员在论文结论中称，可能需要重新评估当前的出院标准、解除隔离标准及患者管理问题。
Current discharge criteria, release criteria and patient management issues may need to be re-evaluated, the researchers concluded.
3月5日，论文作者之一的武汉大学中南医院医学影像科教授徐海波告诉新京报记者，对于应如何调整出院标准应对“复阳”，目前还没有找到更有效的方法和标准。
Xu Haibo, a professor of medical imaging at Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital, told the Beijing News on March 5 that he had not found a more effective method or standard for how to adjust discharge standards to respond to Fuyang.
“我们还在研究中，还没有新的结果，有结果会及时公布。
"We're still working on it, we haven't got any new results, and we'll publish them in time.
目前按照国家卫健委公布的方案执行是最好的。
The current programme implementation, as announced by the National Board of Health, is the best.
”徐海波称。
"said Xu Haibo.
━━━━━需排除“假阴性”因素在国家卫健委发布的《新型冠状病毒肺炎防控方案（第六版）》中，新冠肺炎传染源主要是新型冠状病毒感染的患者，无症状感染者也可能成为传染源。
-- Exclusion of False Negative Factors In the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (Sixth Edition) issued by the National Health Commission, the new coronavirus infection is mainly from patients with new coronavirus infection, and asymptomatic infection may also become a source of infection.
而《新型冠状病毒肺炎防控方案（第五版）》则显示，新冠病毒感染者除临床症状消失外，还必须连续两次唿吸道病原核酸检测阴性(采样间隔至少1天)，才可以判定治愈出院；此外，核酸检测结果阴性不能排除新型冠状病毒感染，需要排除可能产生假阴性的因素。
The New Coronavirus Pneumonia Program (5th Edition) showed that in addition to clinical symptoms, patients with the coronavirus must sound negative for two consecutive RNA tests (at least one day apart) before they can be cured. Negative nucleic acid test results do not rule out a new coronavirus infection.
“假阴性”，成为患者在出院或解除隔离前扰乱诊断的重要因素。
"False negative" has become an important factor for patients to disturb diagnosis before discharge from hospital or isolation.
《新型冠状病毒肺炎防控方案（第五版）》附录的新冠肺炎实验室检测技术指南，对标本采集的种类、方法、包装和保存等都有严格要求，任何一个环节出现问题都可能导致“假阴性”。
The Technical Guidelines for Laboratory Testing of Coronavirus Pneumonia in the Appendix to the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Program (5th edition) have strict requirements on the types, methods, packaging and preservation of samples collected. Any problems in any link may lead to "false negative."
张笑春向新京报记者介绍，目前常用的两种核酸检测方式为肛拭子、咽拭子核酸检测，采用原因是它们高效且方便操作，适合有当前有大量核酸检测需求的状况。
Zhang told the Beijing News that the two commonly used nucleic acid testing methods are anal swab and swabby nucleic acid test because they are efficient and easy to operate and suitable for the current situation with a large number of nucleic acid detection needs.
但是，这两种方式取样局限性较大：“病毒可能不在咽部和肛门，在其他的身体组织中。
However, these two approaches to sampling are more limited: "The virus may not be in the pharynx or anus, in other body tissues.
加上出院患者体内的病毒量较少，操作上也可能没能取到，实际采到的样本中更少。
Combined with fewer viruses in patients discharged from the hospital, they may not be operationally available, and fewer samples are actually collected.
还有试剂盒敏感度、患者身体差异等干扰因素，因此容易显现出‘假阴性’。
There are also test kit sensitivity, patient body difference and other interfering factors, so easy to show 'false negative'.
”“这就是精度和效率的矛盾。
"" That is the contradiction between precision and efficiency.
”张笑春认为，“全国待查人数太多，要做大范围排查，实在很难兼顾。
"Zhang Xiaochun thinks," the number of people to be checked in the country is too many, to do a large-scale screening, really difficult to take into account.
”2月18日，中国工程院院士钟南山也在新闻发布会上表示，用核酸检测确诊是正确的，但还要看取材，如果采样不准确，会造成很大的结果差异。
Also at a press conference on Feb. 18, Zhong Nan Shan, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said the nucleic acid test was correct, but depended on the material, and that inaccurate sampling could lead to significant differences in results.
据国家卫健委检验中心信息，在咽拭子在口腔和鼻腔取样中，由于新冠病毒主要是在肺的深部，离大气管较远，感染者又较多干咳、痰液不多，所以上唿吸道病毒含量相对较低，增加了“假阴性”的出现概率。
According to the National Center for Health Care and Hygiene, in swabs sampled in the mouth and nasal cavity, because the new crown virus is mainly in the deep lung, farther away from the trachea, infected people have more dry cough, less sputum, so Hoo Hoo virus content is relatively low, increasing the probability of "false negative."
在张笑春看来，核酸检测只能给出感染定性参考，而CT影像检测直观反映肺部情况，一定程度上能够和核酸检测互为补充。
In Zhang's view, nucleic acid detection can only give qualitative reference to infection, while CT imaging can directly reflect the lung situation, and to a certain extent can complement nucleic acid detection.
张笑春称，在条件逐渐成熟时，“两管齐下”甚至“多管齐下”，用多种方式做出院前的检测，相信能有效减少后续“复阳”病例的增加。
Zhang said the "two-pronged" or even "multi-pronged" approach to pre-hospital testing when conditions are gradually maturing is believed to be effective in reducing the increase in the number of follow-up cases.

国家卫健委官网截图━━━━━有患者入院后排除了重新感染病毒的可能郭燕红在2月28日的国务院联防联控机制召开的新闻发布会上表示，新冠肺炎病毒是一个新病毒，它的致病机理、疾病的全貌和病程的特点还需要进一步加深认识。
2007-9-25 21: 38 [hide] Guo Yanhong, who ruled out re-infection after admission, said at a press conference on Feb. 28 by the State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism that the virus is a new virus whose pathogenesis, disease profile and course characteristics need to be better understood.
张笑春告诉新京报记者，从目前的临床经验看，新冠肺炎病毒可侵略人体多个器官，因此病毒可能存在于患者的血液、粪便、胸腔积液及脑嵴液等地方，这就为多点检测方式指了路。
Zhang told the Beijing News that current clinical experience shows that the new crown pneumonia virus can invade many parts of the human body, so the virus could be found in the blood, feces, pleural effusion and cerebrocrest fluid, thus paving the way for multi-point detection.
张笑春认为，除了常规的咽拭子、肛拭子检测外，应结合患者临床症状决定核酸检测点，这样有利于防止取样不准、样本量不够、取样部位病毒含量不能反映整体等问题。
In addition to routine pharyngeal swabs and anal swabs, the nucleic acid test points should be determined in the light of the patient's clinical symptoms.
不过和多种方式检测一样，大范围实行多点核酸检测，每次所需的检测时间会更多。
However, as with multiple methods of detection, a large range of multi-point nucleic acid testing would require more testing time at a time.
受制于检测需求对新冠病毒本身的研究进度，目前各地对“复阳”现象采取的措施较为有限。
Due to the progress of research on the new crown virus itself, only limited measures have been taken to the phenomenon of Fuyang.
各地疾控部门的公开资料显示，各地仍以加强出院患者随访、加强健康状况监测等后发式的干预手段为主。
Open data from disease control departments around the world show that people are still being released from hospital to strengthen follow-up, health monitoring and other post-heuristic interventions.
对于海南的“复阳”病例再次出院的经验，海南省人民医院疾控办负责人、感染科副主任吴彪介绍，“复阳”患者再次住院后检查发现患者体内已产生IgG抗体，同时IgM已阴转，排除了重新感染病毒的可能。
After re-hospitalization, patients with Fuyang had developed IgG antibody, while IgM had gone overcast, ruling out the possibility of reinfection, said Wu Biao, deputy director of infection and director of the Department of Infection of the People's Hospital of Hainan Province.
海南省人民医院在符合国家卫健委出院标准的患者出院前，会对其进行全血、粪便的核酸检测，确定全阴性后方可出院。
People's Hospital of Hainan Province will test the nucleic acid of whole blood and feces before discharged from the hospital.
医院将加强对出院新冠肺炎患者跟踪随访，按属地疾病控制中心指定场所统一实施为期14天免费的康复隔离和医学观察。
The hospital will strengthen the follow-up and follow-up of patients discharged from the hospital, and implement 14 days of free rehabilitation isolation and medical observation according to the designated places of the CDC.
从患者出院当日起至出院后12周，为出院患者设立第4周、第8周、第12周三个返院复查节点。
From the day the patient is discharged from hospital until 12 weeks after discharge, three return review nodes are set up for discharge patients in week 4, week 8 and week 12.
重点复查血常规、血生化、指脉氧、新冠病毒抗体、多部位核酸、胸部CT等项目，开展健康指导和健康状况监测，实现全流程管理。
Focus on the review of routine blood, blood biochemistry, finger oxygen, new crown virus antibody, multi-site nucleic acid, chest CT and other projects, health guidance and health monitoring to achieve full process management.
2月22日上午，广州市第八人民医院党委副书记、主任医师张复春则在发布会上建议，出院病人依然要做好居家隔离，在家进行分餐制。
On the morning of February 22, Zhang Fuchun, deputy secretary and chief physician of the Eighth People's Hospital of Guangzhou, suggested at a press conference that patients discharged from the hospital should still stay at home and have separate meals.
据其称，有病人出院两周后又出现阳性，目前对病期以及带毒时间还不清楚，为此要求所有患者两周、四周后回医院随访。
He said patients tested positive two weeks after they were discharged from the hospital. The duration of the illness and its duration are unknown, and all patients were asked to return to the hospital in two or four weeks.
除了严格随访机制，武汉大学中南医院医学影像科副主任张笑春认为，可以考虑延长出院患者的社区隔离及居家隔离时间。
Besides strict follow-up mechanism, Zhang Xiaochun, deputy director of medical imaging department of Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital, suggested that the extension of community isolation and home isolation time for patients discharged from hospital should be considered.
”康复者在解除医院隔离后，还需要在社区的隔离点隔离14天再归家，这期间能得到简单的医疗服务。
Survivors are also separated from the hospital for 14 days before returning to their homes at community isolation points, where they receive simple medical care.
这个时间或许可以考虑延长到2个月，甚至3个月，拉长观察的时间窗。
This time period might be considered extended to two or even three months, lengthening the observation window.
“张笑春建议。
Zhang Xiaochun suggested.
3月4日，国家卫健委公布的第七版诊疗方案中，出院后注意事项也有所修改。
On March 4, the National Fitness and Health Commission announced the seventh edition of the diagnosis and treatment program, after discharge from the attention has also been modified.
考虑到有少数出院患者出现核酸检测复检阳性的问题，为加强对出院患者的健康管理和隔离，将“应继续进行14天自我健康状况监测”改为“应继续进行14天的隔离管理和健康状况监测”。
In view of the small number of patients discharged from the hospital who had tested positive for nucleic acid tests, and in order to strengthen health management and isolation of patients discharged from hospital, the words "should continue monitoring self-health for 14 days" should be replaced by "monitoring isolation and health status for 14 days."
这意味着出院患者出院后，仍需接受医护人员进行健康状况监测，与此前的自我检测相比严格程度有所提升。
This means that discharged patients are still subject to health monitoring by medical personnel after discharge from hospital, which is more stringent than previous self-tests.
━━━━━“复阳”患者是否传染暂无定论由于“复阳”病例多在解除隔离后的复检中发现，因此可以自由活动的“复阳”病例是否有传染性，成为“复阳”当下最受关注的要点。
2006-03-10 09: 53: 00 Whether a patient is infected or not is uncertain As most cases of Fuyang are found in post-isolation re-examination, whether the cases of Fuyang that can move freely are infectious or not has become the most important concern of Fuyang at present.
▲国家卫健委医政医管局监察专员郭燕红介绍“复阳”情况。
Guo Yanhong, National Fitness and Health Commission Medical Authority Supervisor, introduced the "Fuyang" situation.
央视新闻截图当下“复阳”病例的传染性认识，与目前全球医学界对新冠病毒的认识一样，依然处于探索中。
CCTV news screenshots of the current "Fuyang" cases of infectious awareness, and the current global medical community to the new crown virus, is still in the exploration.
加拿大安大略省卫生厅医学微生物学负责人凡尼莎·艾伦（Vanessa 。
Vanessa Allen, Director of Medical Microbiology, Ontario Health Agency, Canada.
Allen）在新闻发布会上称，在“复阳”病例的检测样本中发现了一些遗传物质或病毒物质残留，但目前还不能从这些残留物质中确定病毒的存活状态，也暂不明确“复阳”患者是否仍有传染性。
Allen told a news conference that genetic material or viral residues had been found in test samples of Fuyang cases, but it was not possible to determine whether the virus was alive from those residues, and it was not clear whether Fuyang patients were still infectious.
2月27日，钟南山表示，新冠肺炎是新发传染病，还不知道它的传播过程，目前不能下绝对的定论。
Zhong Nan Shan said February 27, the new crown pneumonia is a new infectious disease, do not know its spread process, can not be absolutely conclusive.
但是根据微生物的规律，一般只要患者身体里产生了足够抗体，这病人就不会再感染了。
But according to the microbe's laws, as long as the patient's body produces enough antibodies, the patient will not be infected again.
但这样的患者会不会再传染给别人，仍有待观察。
But it remains to be seen whether such patients will infect others again.
在徐海波看来，康复出院病例的核酸检测呈阳性，可能说明部分康复者体内仍携带有病毒，但是否有传染性仍未清楚。
In Xu's view, the positive nucleic acid test in the case of convalescent discharge may indicate that some convalescent patients still carry the virus, but whether it is infectious or not is unclear.
张笑春则认为，“复阳”可能源于病例出院接受检测时体内病毒量较低，未达到核酸检测阳性的程度，因此未能被检测出来；出院后，其体内病毒有所繁殖，病毒含量增高到能被检测出阳性。
Zhang said the virus could have been detected because patients were discharged from the hospital with a low viral load and did not test positive for nucleic acid, so they could not be detected. After discharge, the virus multiplied in the body and the virus levels increased to the point where it could be tested positive.
这说明病人在隔离期后，体内的病毒仍有一定活性，因此防范“复阳”病例传染性非常有必要。
This shows that the virus in the body is still active after isolation period, so it is necessary to prevent the reyang cases from infecting.
海南省人民医院疾控办负责人、感染科副主任吴彪认为，达到国家出院标准后出院的患者，理论上机体处于康复过程，机体存量病毒处于清除过程。
Wu Biao, deputy director of infection department and director of the disease control office of Hainan People's Hospital, said that patients discharged after meeting the national discharge standards were theoretically in the process of recovery, the body stock of viruses in the clearance process.
如果出现恢复期核酸检测呈阳性，只要通过临床综合判断不是疾病复发，它也不会构成很大的威胁，成为新的传染源的可能性也是非常小的。
If the convalescent nucleic acid test is positive, it does not pose a significant threat as long as it does not recur through clinical syndromes, and the likelihood of becoming a new source of infection is very low.
2月25日，广州市第八人民医院感染病中心ICU主任李粤平也在广东省疫情发布会上介绍，虽然“复阳”病例的核酸检测呈阳性，但从技术上很难区分是活病毒还是死病毒。
Li Yuping, director of ICU at the Infection Centre of the Eighth People's Hospital in Guangzhou, also told a news conference in Guangdong province on February 25 that although Fuyang cases tested positive for nucleic acid, it was technically difficult to distinguish between live and dead viruses.
所以对于病毒的防控，仍需严防死守。
So for the prevention and control of the virus, still need to guard strictly.
“对‘复阳’的现象，医院和个人是要注意防控，但也不需要太恐慌，更不要歧视康复出院的病人。
"Hospitals and individuals should pay attention to prevention and control of the phenomenon of 'Fuyang', but don't need to panic too much, let alone discriminate against patients recovering from hospital.
”张笑春称，“我们有的是办法应对，只是在各个层面需要做好权衡，改善的空间很大。
"We have plenty of ways to deal with it, but there is a lot of room for improvement at all levels," Zhang said.
