文 |《财经》数据研究员徐进 图 |《财经》视觉中心 编辑 | 郝洲一、国内多地迎来零新增，海外蔓延仍未得到遏制今日国内简述：国内3月3日报告累计病例80270例，新增119例，低于韩国、意大利、伊朗等国。
Hao, editor and director of Caijing's Vision Center, has seen zero new cases of overseas spread unchecked today: China reported 80,270 cases on March 3, an increase of 119 new cases, lower than in South Korea, Italy and Iran.
新增病例114例来自武汉，广大非武汉地区5例，其中北京的3例有2例是境外输入（分别来自伊朗和意大利）。
There were 114 new cases in Wuhan and 5 cases in non-Wuhan areas, 2 of which were imported from abroad (from Iran and Italy respectively).
武汉仍保持在三位数，但上游数据均已充分收敛，当日新增疑似病例仅43例，已经连续4天保持在两位数水平。
Wuhan remains in three digits, but upstream figures have fully converged, with only 43 new suspected cases reported that day, remaining at double-digit levels for four consecutive days.
还有一个好消息是，武汉的治愈率跨过50%节点，全国治愈率则跨过60%。
The good news is that Wuhan has a cure rate of more than 50% and a national cure rate of 60%.

中方解释称，这些地方政府不只是针对韩国公民，限制措施是一视同仁的。
China explained that these local governments are not just targeting Korean citizens; the restrictions are non-discriminatory.
