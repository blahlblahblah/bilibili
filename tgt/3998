Editor Chen Jing 12 March 2020 at 15: 58.
几周以来，我和同事们记录下了一些与疫情相关的玩家故事。
Over the past few weeks, my colleagues and I have documented a number of player stories related to the epidemic.
他们是在武汉的普通人、老游戏编辑，他们是在其他城市的剧场演员、与父母和解的孩子、等待开业的网吧老板……非常时期，这些或平淡或跌宕的故事组成了复杂的生活。
They are ordinary people in Wuhan, old game editors, theatre actors in other cities, children reconciled with their parents, cybercafe owners waiting to start their own businesses... these insipid or understated stories make up a complex life in times of uncertainty.
。
.
另一些人的生活也在继续。
Others continue their lives.
这一次，我们把目光放在了游戏从业者们身上。
This time, we focused on the players.

■ 云端复工。
▪ Cloud return to work.
2月初，游戏公司开始陆续复工。
In early February, the game company began to resume work.
。
.
杨明为了做一个PPT熬了个通宵。
Yang Ming stayed up all night to do a PPT.
家里网速不稳，数据跑得很慢，连接公司内网的VPN也没有Mac版，这些都影响着她的工作效率。
Instability at home, slow data runs, and the lack of a Mac version of VPN, which connects to the company's intranet, all affect her productivity.
一夜过去，她揉揉眼睛，按着酸痛的肩膀，倒在床上叹了口气。
After a night, she rubbed her eyes, pressed her aching shoulder, fell on the bed and sighed.
这就是远程办公啊。
This is telecommuting.
。
.
杨明在2月3日准时“在线复工”。
Yang Ming returned to work on time on February 3.
在这之前，她已经一个多月没上街了。
She had not been out of the street for more than a month.
春节前，她订了1月22日的高铁票回湖北老家，临走前一天，领导找她吃了个饭，劝她，湖北那边疫情很严重，回去可能有危险。
Before the Spring Festival, she booked a high-speed rail ticket back to her hometown of Hubei Province on January 22. The day before her departure, the leader asked her to have a meal and advised her that there was a serious epidemic in Hubei Province and that her return might be dangerous.
她思考再三，退掉高铁票，留在了广州。
She thought again and again, returned the high-speed train ticket and stayed in Guangzhou.
。
.
这样真的值得吗？开始远程办公之后，杨明一直有些后悔。
Is it really worth it? After starting telecommuting, Yang Ming has been a little regretful.
。
.
在游戏大厂做运营，她的工作总是异常忙碌，春节不回家可能意味着一整年都没法和家人见面。
Operating out of a big game factory, she's always so busy that not coming home for the Spring Festival can mean she won't be able to see her family all year round.
“我有点儿羡慕那些回了家的人。
"I was a little envious of those who went home.
”她说，“虽然立场不太对，但他们也算是因祸得福吧，可以和家人多待一会。
'she said.' Not exactly right, but they're lucky enough to stay with their families a little longer.
”。
"
即使远程办公，工作量也没什么变化，就算有项目推迟了，领导也有安排，规划一篇接着一篇地往后写，“反正总能让你的工作量饱和”。
Even if you telecommute, the workload doesn't change. Even if a project is delayed, the leader has plans to write one project after another, "Always keep your workload saturated."
。
.
与杨明相似，莉莉丝市场部的高洋也是流落在外的湖北人。
Similar to Yang Ming, Lilith marketing department of Kaoyang is also a wandering Hubei people.
他在老家封城前一天取消了机票，留在上海。
He cancelled his ticket the day before his home town and stayed in Shanghai.
尽管上海的情况比湖北好，但他的湖北籍身份证无论如何都进不了办公园区。
Although the situation in Shanghai is better than in Hubei, his Hubei identity card can not enter the office park anyway.
远程办公几乎成了他唯一的选择。
Telecommuting was almost his only option.
。
.
但高洋还有些盼头。
But Gao Yang has something to look forward to.
春节前，莉莉丝内部发下通知，如果有员工家在湖北或回家途径湖北、但春节选择不回家的，等疫情结束后会补偿5天带薪探亲年假。
Before the Spring Festival, Lilith issued an internal circular, if the staff members' families in Hubei or home via Hubei, but choose not to return home after the Spring Festival, after the end of the epidemic will compensate five days paid annual family visit leave.
到那时，人们可以回家看看家人。
Then people can go home and see their families.
。
.
离广州不远的深圳，另一家大厂的策划王宇比杨明还早一天复工。
In Shenzhen, not far from Guangzhou, Wang Yu, the planner of another big factory, returned to work a day earlier than Yang Ming.
尽管公司把假期从2月2日延长到了2月9日，但项目照旧，“老板还是会找你要进度”。
Although the company extended the holiday from Feb. 2 to Feb. 9, the project went on as usual, "the boss will still want you to make progress."
王宇把笔记本电脑搬到了床边的飘窗上，找个舒服的地方干活，累了就往床上一躺。
Mr. Wang moved his laptop to a floating window next to his bed and found a comfortable place to work. When he was tired, he went to bed.
。
.
电脑就放在床边。
The computer is beside the bed.
在重庆，居家隔离仍在继续，各小区开始严格执行出入措施，每一户每两天可以有一个人出门。
In Chongqing, residential segregation continues, with neighborhoods starting to enforce strict access rules, with one person per household every two days.
2月10日，帕斯亚科技开始远程办公，上下班不设打卡，每人每天晚上11点前需要提交日报。
On February 10, Pasia technology began telecommuting, there is no card to work, each person before 11 p.m. each day to submit daily newspapers.
为了确认进度，副总邓永进每天“下班”的时间远远晚于11点。
To confirm the progress, Vice President Deng Yongjin "off duty" well after 11 o'clock every day.
。
.
2月10日，张雯雯在杭州家里开始了远程办公。
On February 10, Zhang Wenwen started telecommuting at his home in Hangzhou.
她在一家游戏大厂杭州分部的市场部任职，公司规定每个部门复工人数不能超过10%，实在需要复工的，必须打报告提申请。
She works in the marketing department of Hangzhou, a large game factory. The company requires that no more than 10% of workers in each department return to work.
。
.
一天之后，杭州全面启用“健康码”系统。
A day later, Hangzhou fully launched the "Health Code" system.
这个由钉钉和支付宝共同开发的系统迅速成为杭州人的出入通行证。
The system, developed jointly by Nailing and Paying Bao, quickly became an entry and exit pass for Hangzhou people.
为了在“抗疫”期间做到部分复工，只有获得绿色码的人才能在城市里自由活动。
In order to return to work partially during the plague, only people with green codes can move freely in the city.
张雯雯所在的小区，住户出入除了要量体温，也必须出示健康码。
Zhang Wenwen's community, in addition to the residents to take temperature, must also show health code.
。
.
在杭州，健康码是人们出行的必要条件之一。
In Hangzhou, the health code is one of the necessary conditions for people to travel.
“我们这个工作原本就是线上的活儿多。
"Our job is already a lot of online work.
”张雯雯说。
Zhang Wenwen said.
她手头有几个新游戏的宣传，原本就没有计划做线下活动，所以都在按部就班地进行。
She had several new games on hand, and had no plans to do offline activities, so she was on track.
但有些时候，远程办公仍不能让人完全适应。
But sometimes telecommuting still doesn't fit perfectly.
出于工作需要，她平时下班后也经常保持在线；疫情期间，休息时间还在发工作信息的人越来越多了。
She often stays online after work due to work needs, and more and more people are giving work information during breaks during the epidemic.
“因为现在人人在家，除了饭点儿之外，领导会觉得你应该一直在网上。
"Since everyone is at home now, the leaders will think you should be online all the time, except for the food.
”。
"
■ 远程办公。
▪ Telecommuting.
在公司上班时，很多人反感“996”，直到开始在家办公，一部分人意识到，“996”至少还有界限，帮你明确区分工作和休息。
At work, many people resent '996' until they start working from home, and some realize that '996' has at least some boundaries to help you distinguish clearly between work and rest.
一旦足不出户，最后的界限也消失了。
Once you stay in your house, the final boundaries disappear.
。
.
作为策划，王宇在远程办公过程中没受到过硬件限制，“有个Word就能干活”。
As a planning, Wang Yu in the teleworking process did not suffer from hardware constraints, "have Word can work."
但和同事的交流明显少了，闭门造车，工作质量也有所降低。
But communication with co-workers is noticeably less, behind closed doors, and the quality of work is reduced.
。
.
坐办公室时，他每天工作到晚上十一二点，然后回家洗漱睡觉。
While sitting in his office, he worked until eleven or twelve in the evening and then went home to wash and sleep.
现在白天总忍不住偷懒，积下的工作就要靠晚上熬夜，凌晨两三点结束工作，再玩玩手机，四五点睡觉成了家常便饭。
I can't help being lazy during the day. I have to stay up late at night, finish work at 2 or 3 in the morning, play with cell phones, and go to bed at four or five.
“白天不干活，晚上不睡觉。
"No work during the day, no sleep at night.
”王宇总结。
Wang Yu summed it up.
在家办公打破了他一直以来“在家Soho”的梦想。
Working from home broke his long-held dream of "Soho at home."
。
.
杨明以前从来不加领导和同事的微信，现在除了微信，泡泡、易信等聊天软件也进入了她的手机和电脑。
Yang Ming never used to be a leader or a colleague, but now she has access to her cell phone and computer in addition to micromail, bubble, e-mail and other chat software.
她给自己订了一条规矩：不能比平时工作得更晚。
She made it a rule not to work later than usual.
以前，她平均9点多钟下班，远程办公后，如果很晚还有人发消息谈工作，即使她看到信息，也不会回复。
Previously, she had been away from work at an average of more than 9: 00, and if someone sent a message late after work, she wouldn't respond even if she saw it.
。
.
“即使你工作到很晚，肯定也不会算加班的。
"Even if you work late, you won't be working overtime.
”高洋说，“大家都在家里，没法具体衡量。
"Everyone is at home," Gao Yang said.
”目前，只有周六、周日工作可以提加班申请。
Currently, overtime applications are only available on Saturdays and Sundays.
。
.
IT部门成了莉莉丝最忙的一批人。
The IT department became Lilith's busiest group.
为了确保远程办公顺利，他们在上海安排了“送机上门”——哪个同事家里设备不合适，IT部门就派人把公司的电脑直接送去。
To ensure smooth telecommuting, they set up a "delivery door" in Shanghai, where the IT department sent someone to deliver the company's computer directly to a colleague whose home equipment was not suitable.
除此之外，他们还要帮一些同事联上公司内网，解决软硬件问题，工作量直线上升。
In addition, they have to help some colleagues to connect to the company's intranet, solve hardware and software problems, workload skyrocketed.
。
.
餐桌、电脑、零食和汽水，是许多人远程办公的常态。
Dinner tables, computers, snacks and sodas are the norm for many people when they are telecommuting.
帕斯亚从2017年开始试用VPN加Redmine模式，把一部分工作放到了线上，如今把这套系统从内网搬到外网，也不算难事。
Pasqua started experimenting with the VPN plus Redmine model in 2017, putting some of the work online, and moving the system from the intranet to the extranet is now not difficult.
受影响最大的仍是工作效率。
The greatest impact continues to be on productivity.
。
.
“游戏研发需要激情。
"Game development requires passion.
”邓永进强调。
Deng stressed.
帕斯亚现在有5个团队，超过150人，但他们没给任何一个团队规定过KPI。
Pasia now has five teams of more than 150 people, but they have not assigned KPI to any of the teams.
“就像策划对程序说，想在游戏里做一道门。
"It's like planning to say to a program that you want to make a door in the game.
假如是一个为KPI工作的程序，他做完了就完了。
If it was a program that worked for KPI, he'd be done with it.
只有好的程序才会思考，这个门要怎么开、速度会不会变，撞到会不会反弹、怎么反弹，如果有灯光，光怎么打、照到人会有什么反应……这些东西用KPI是要求不出来的。
Only a good program thinks about how the door will open, how fast it will change, whether it will bounce back, how it will bounce back, if there are lights, how light will be struck, how people will react... these things will not be required by KPI.
但最终游戏呈现出的细节，就取决于它们。
But in the end, the details of the game will depend on them.
”。
"
不求KPI的工作方式让效率变得更不可控。
Working in a way that does not require KPI makes efficiency even more uncontrollable.
邓永进说，他还不知道开工之后要怎么补上进度，“很多东西不是单纯增加时间就能做好的”。
Mr. Deng says he doesn't know how to make up for the delay after work starts. 'A lot of things can't be done simply by adding time.'
。
.
与此同时，工资要照发，办公楼租金也要照付。
At the same time, salaries are paid, as are office rents.
邓永进他们试着申请减免租金，但始终没有收到减免通知。
Deng Yongjin tried to apply for rent relief, but never received a waiver.
。
.
“重庆市目前的政策是，国有资产的办公楼能减免，但我们这个楼不是。
"Chongqing's current policy is that the offices of state-owned assets can be relieved, but our building is not.
”同样是经营者，邓永进理解私人房东们的资金压力。
The same operator, Deng Yongjin, understands the pressure on private landlords' money.

帕斯亚科技，一名武汉同事正在家中远程办公。
A colleague from Wuhan is telecommuting at his home in Passepartout.
■ 人在武汉。
▪ Man in Wuhan.
2月以来，铃空游戏CEO罗翔宇一直在接受采访。
Since February, Suzuki CEO Luo Xiangyu has been interviewed.
包括新华网、《长江日报》在内的主流媒体纷纷开始关注这家位于武汉的游戏公司。
Mainstream media, including Xinhua and Changjiang Daily, began to pay close attention to the Wuhan-based game company.
。
.
“武汉当地领导还是很关心游戏的。
"Wuhan local leaders are still very concerned about the game.
”罗翔宇告诉我。
"he told me.
但政府领导关心或主流媒体来采访，问得最详细的问题大多是收入有没有受影响，损失有多少，远程办公是否现实，效率如何，对游戏本身没有太多关注。
But the most detailed questions asked by government leaders who care about or are interviewed by mainstream media are mostly whether revenue is affected, how much is lost, whether telecommuting is realistic and efficient, and how little attention is paid to the game itself.
“他们应该是了解到有一部分在线游戏吃到了疫情红利，所以开始关注疫情对这个行业有哪些短期影响和长期影响。
"They should be aware that some of the online games are receiving an epidemic dividend, so they're starting to look at the short-term and long-term effects of the epidemic on the industry."
”罗翔宇还没有看到具体报导发表出来，但他认为，这是领导、主流媒体关注游戏行业的原因之一。
Mr Luo has yet to see the report published, but believes it is one of the reasons leading the mainstream media to pay attention to the industry.
。
.
罗翔宇家住在武汉青山区，离高铁站、欢乐谷都不远。
Luo Xiangyu lives in Wuhan Qingshan area, away from the high-speed railway station, Happy Valley are not far.
他的小区已经有数百人感染，同一栋楼里就有两户人家确诊，这让他愈发关注疫情发展变化。
Hundreds of people have been infected in his neighborhood, and two families in the same building have been diagnosed, making him increasingly concerned about the epidemic.
“我要负责信息过滤，”罗翔宇说，“关于疫情的负面消息太多了，家里人看到之后，心情都不太好，我心理素质好一点，就多看点，有需要注意的地方再提醒他们。
"I am responsible for information filtering," said Luo Xiangyu. "There is too much negative news about the epidemic. When my family see it, I am not in a good mood.
”。
"
武汉疫情快速发展之前，罗翔宇就隐约听到了一些消息，为此他给员工们提前放了假。
Before the rapid development of Wuhan epidemic, Luo Xiangyu vaguely heard some news, for which he gave the employees early leave.
铃空的员工百分之七八十都是武汉人和湖北人，还有不少外省员工在武汉安了家，他们把父母接来过年，结果一起困在了武汉。
Seventy-eight percent of Suzuki's staff are Wuhan and Hubei, and many other provincial employees have settled down in Wuhan. They took their parents to Wuhan for the New Year and ended up stranded in Wuhan.
“这种事情谁也想不到。
"Nobody could have thought of such a thing.
”罗翔宇说。
"said Luo Xiangyu.
。
.
疫情期间，罗翔宇在武汉街头。
During the outbreak, Luo Xiangyu was on the streets of Wuhan.
与许多游戏公司不同，铃空的远程办公并不顺利。
Unlike many gaming companies, Suzuki's telecommuting isn't going well.
很多员工家里甚至没有台式电脑，即使有，配置也不好，很难胜任工作。
Many employees do not even have desktop computers at home, and when they do, they are poorly equipped to do the job.
目前，只有一部分设计人员在远程办公，其他职位，美术、程序、运营等还在延长放假。
Currently, only some designers are telecommuting, and other jobs, art, programs, and operations are being extended.
为了赶进度，罗翔宇把一部分工作外包了出去。
In order to catch up, Luo Xiangyu outsourced part of the work.
尽管成本增加了不少，但他还是感到“其实挺幸运”，由于主力项目前期设计基本完工，现在已经到了资源量产期，美术靠外包还能继续推进度。
Although the cost has increased a lot, but he still felt "really lucky", because the main project pre-project design is almost complete, has now come to the volume of resources due, arts outsourcing can continue to advance.
假如在开发早期遇到这种情况，那么整个项目会受到严重影响。
If this happens in the early stages of development, the whole project could be seriously affected.
。
.
作为CEO，罗翔宇必须恢复工作，每天的时间表都被排满。
As CEO, Luo Xiang-woo had to get back to work and his daily schedule was full.
做完的任务汇报上来，他要了解，再安排下新任务，平日里一两句话就能说清楚的零碎细节如今要花上几倍时间才能完成，不知不觉，一天就过去了。
When the work was done, he must understand that the little details which could be explained in a word or two in the ordinary course of duty took several times to complete, and before he knew it, a day passed.
有一次，他半夜12点还在和游戏导演聊预告片分镜，一聊就聊到了凌晨。
Once, he was still talking to the game director about the trailer at 12: 00 in the middle of the night, chatting until early morning.
。
.
“在家待着反而满脑子都是工作。
"All I can think of is work at home.
”罗翔宇苦笑。
"Lo Xiangyu smiled bitterly.
假期很长，他原本想把以前攒下没时间玩的游戏玩一玩，但回头算下来，一个都没通关。
The holidays were long and he had wanted to play games that he had not had time to play before, but in retrospect, none of them passed through customs.
“才玩一会儿就要放下手柄，去处理工作上的事儿，等到干完活，主机和电视早就待机了，也没心情玩了。
"After a while, you put down the handle and get on with your work, and when you're done, the mainframe and the TV are ready and in no mood for play.
”。
"
《超级机器人大战T》是罗翔宇想在假期里通关的游戏之一。
"Super Robot T" is one of Luo Xiangyu wants to go through the customs in the holidays.
他是这样，其他员工也是这样。
He is, and so are the other employees.
很多人是铁杆主机玩家，一开始没想到疫情如此严重，去父母家过年时除了手机什么也没带。
Many people are hardcore mainframe players, initially did not expect the outbreak of such a serious, to parents when the New Year nothing but mobile phones.
一个同事在工作群里抱怨，他把流行的手游都下载来玩了玩，结果“快要吐了”。
A co-worker complained in the work group that he was "going to puke" by downloading all his popular hand tours.
。
.
放假在家的日子，除了工作之外，罗翔宇也没有闲着。
Holiday home days, in addition to work, Luo Xiangyu is not idle.
疫情严重时，他在网上看到武汉本地医院的求助信息，就开车把收集到的物资直接拉去医院，其中有他们自己弄到的，也有海外合作伙伴委托的。
When the outbreak was severe, he saw help messages from local hospitals in Wuhan and drove the collected materials directly to hospitals, either by themselves or with overseas partners.
后来，管控越来越严，汽车上不了路，他们又转到线上，办Game Jam，做直播，玩家打赏的钱就直接转给医院。
Later, as controls grew too tight for cars to get on the road, they switched to the line and ran Game Jam, which was broadcast live, and the player's money was transferred directly to the hospital.
。
.
湖北省的复工日期暂时延长到了3月10日。
The date of resumption of work in Hubei province was temporarily extended to March 10.
但罗翔宇决定，至少比政府建议的时间再延后半个月。
But Mr Luo decided at least half a month later than the government suggested.
这段时间里，员工工资、办公室租金都要照付。
During this time, staff wages, office rental will be paid.
铃空的办公室选在武汉光谷，靠着前一个游戏《临终：重生试炼》的收入，罗翔宇觉得“还过得去”，据他了解，高新区或许还会进一步减免租金，这会让他们的压力再减少一些。
Suzuki's office was selected in Wuhan Light Valley and, relying on the income from the previous game, "Death: A Trial of Rebirth," Luo Xiangyu felt "tolerable," and he understood that the new high-tech area might offer further rent relief, which would make them less stressed.
。
.
“处在这个环境里，个人的感觉是很无助的。
"In this environment, a person's feelings are very helpless.
”罗翔宇一直觉得，到了疫情结束之后，经济可能恢复得很快，但人们的心理就未必有那么快。
"Luo Xiangyu felt that the economy might recover quickly after the epidemic ended, but people's psychology might not be so fast.
有一次，他和同事在群里聊天，自然而然地谈到了疫情。
Once he talked to his colleagues in the group, and naturally he talked about the outbreak.
一个人打趣说，没想到有生之年还可以扮演“生化危机”里的NPC。
One joked that he didn't expect to be able to play the NPC in his lifetime.
隔离期间，这种苦中作乐的发言他经常能听见。
He could often hear such harrowing speeches during periods of isolation.
。
.
实际上，情绪有时蔓延得很快。
In fact, emotions sometimes spread quickly.
仅在铃空的员工里，罗翔宇就听说有人的家人、亲戚、朋友确诊甚至不幸去世的。
Among Suzuki employees alone, Luo Xiangyu has heard of someone's family, relatives, friends diagnosed and even tragically died.
还有些人，听到家人咳嗽就会紧张起来。
Some people get nervous when they hear their families cough.
“这种情绪，其他城市的人很难感同身受。
"It's a sentiment that people in other cities find hard to empathize with.
”罗翔宇又举了个例子：“你从家里窗户往外看，时不时就有救护车进小区把病人抬走，这时候你内心的感觉，没亲眼看过的人肯定体会不到。
Lo Xiang-woo gave another example: "When you look out of your home window and an ambulance comes in every now and then to carry a patient away, you feel something inside you that no one who has ever seen with your own eyes can understand.
在这种情况下，即使有人遭遇不幸，你也很难去安慰，只能指望哪天疫情真正好转。
In such cases, even if someone is in trouble, it's hard to be comforted by the fact that you can only hope for a real turnaround.
”。
"
春节之前，罗翔宇买了不少末日、灾难题材的蓝光碟，打算在假期里补一补，顺便为下一部末世主题的新游戏做准备。
Before the Spring Festival, Luo Xiangyu bought a lot of doom and disaster-themed blue discs, which he intended to make up during the holidays and prepare for the next game on the final theme.
如今，这些碟片几乎都在角落里吃灰。
These dishes are now eaten almost entirely in the corner.
每当他想打开看，妻子都会一脸厌恶地关掉。
Whenever he tried to open it, his wife would turn it off in disgust.
“太容易触景生情了。
"It's too easy.
”她说。
'she said.
。
.
电影不能看，罗翔宇就带着5岁的儿子玩Switch，父子俩一起通关了《路易吉洋馆3》。
Unable to see the movie, Luo Xiangyu took his 5-year-old son with him to play Switch.
儿子玩得很开心，罗翔宇也若有所思。
The son had a good time and Luo Xiangyu was thoughtful.
“任天堂的新手教程真是太强了，《路易吉洋馆3》这个游戏，Switch上所有的按键都要用到，按理说是很复杂，却能让一个5岁小孩轻松掌握。
"Nintendo's rookie tutorials are great. The Louise House 3 game, which uses all the keys within the switch, is complex, but easy for a 5-year-old to master.
”他暗下决心，新游戏一定要做好新手引导。
He made up his mind that the new game must be guided by new players.
。
.
和儿子一起玩游戏，罗翔宇找到了不少灵感。
With his son to play games, Luo Xiangyu found a lot of inspiration.
■ “禁忌话题”。
▪ Taboo topics.
在新冠肺炎的阴影下，人们躲在口罩背后，小心翼翼地谈论着实体经济可能受到的影响。
In the shadow of new crown pneumonia, people hide behind masks and talk gingerly about the likely impact on the real economy.
与之相比，网络消费、“宅经济”被当成了逆风崛起的典型。
In contrast, the network consumption, the "home economy" has been regarded as the rise of the typical upwind.
1月底，一些“大厂头部游戏流水创新高”的新闻成为热门。
At the end of January, news items such as "Big Head Games" hit new highs.
。
.
但在流量激增、人气火热的同时，游戏行业，或者说，大部分仍在游戏行业中的人，他们的态度都异常谨慎。
But while traffic is soaring and sentiment is soaring, the gaming industry, or most of those still in the game business, is unusually cautious.
一方面，游戏公司也像全国大部分人一样，关注着疫情发展和被疫情影响的人们的生活；另一方面，他们还要尽可能地保护自己。
On the one hand, game companies, like most people around the country, are watching the epidemic and the lives of people affected by it; on the other, they want to protect themselves as much as possible.
。
.
“这是个明确的高压线，绝对不能说。
"It's a clear high-tension line and it's absolutely impossible to say.
”在大厂工作的王宇从一个侧面验证了那些流水、DAU数据的真实。
Wang Yu, who works in a large factory, verified the authenticity of the flowing water and DAU data from one side.
与往年春节假期相比，游戏——尤其是头部游戏——各项数据上涨时间更久，涨幅更大，一些游戏甚至“现在都还在涨”，这些都不是仅靠春节就能做到的。
Games - especially head games - are up longer and faster than Spring Festival holidays, and some games are "still going up," which is not something that Spring Festival alone can do.
。
.
往年，杨明负责的几个项目春节都算淡季。
In previous years, Yang Ming responsible for several items Spring Festival are off season.
“大家都出去聚会了，留给游戏的时间就少了。
"Everybody's gone out to the party, leaving less time for the game.
”但在今年，杨明发现许多端游的涨幅比手游还猛，她猜想，这是因为人们都在家里，打开电脑玩端游的比例也会增加。
But this year, Yang found that many of the increases were sharper than those for hand-to-hand travel, which she suspects is due to an increase in the proportion of people at home who open their computers to play computer games.
。
.
张雯雯的岗位接触不到具体数据，但她也玩《王者荣耀》《和平精英》和在线棋牌。
Zhang Wenwen did not have access to specific data, but she also played "Glory of the King," "Peace Elite" and online chess.
春节期间，这些游戏明显更卡了，排队时间越来越长，“‘吃鸡’服务器崩了”一度登上微博热搜。
During the Spring Festival, these games obviously card, more and more long queues, "'eat chicken' server collapse," once boarded Weibo hot search.
棋牌类游戏平台也难逃人满为患的“惨况”。
Chess game platform is also difficult to escape the overcrowding "miserable situation."
有那么几天，她想在晚饭后和亲戚打打在线麻将，却发现根本登录不上，只能改在白天玩。
For a few days, she wanted to play online mahjong with relatives after dinner, only to find she couldn't log in at all and had to play during the day.
。
.
她听公司策划说，从春节假期到疫情期间，公司几个游戏只多做了几张宣传海报，给角色戴上口罩，宣传防控知识，提醒玩家注意安全，等等，除此之外没有任何活动。
She heard the company plan that during the Spring Festival to the outbreak, the company did nothing more than put up posters, put masks on characters, spread awareness of prevention and control, remind players to be safe, and so on.
“我们会很低调，不想被宣传。
"We keep a low profile and don't want to be publicised.
”张雯雯说。
Zhang Wenwen said.
。
.
莉莉丝同样希望低调。
Lilith wants to keep a low profile.
他们没有做疫情相关的活动。
They did not carry out any epidemic-related activities.
2月，莉莉丝通过湖北省慈善总会向疫区捐款1000万元，还在《剑与远征》官网上加了“共抗疫情，国泰民安”字样。
In February, Lilith donated 10 million yuan to the affected areas through the Hubei Provincial Charity Federation, adding the words "Against the Sword and Expedition" to the official website.
但也仅此而已。
But that is all.
。
.
号召捐款、宣传防疫知识……许多游戏公司积极地做着这些事，又不希望被太多人知道。
Call for donations, spread awareness of epidemic prevention... Many gaming companies actively do these things, but do not want to be known to too many people.
与吃足红利的手游相比，单机游戏的数据相对平稳。
Compared with hand-to-hand travel with sufficient dividends, the data for single-player games are relatively stable.
2月份，《波西亚时光》的WeGame销量相比1月份上升了一倍，Steam端也略有提升，但这种提升并没给帕斯亚带来额外收入——在此之前，他们已经宣布，将会把2月份Steam和WeGame平台的全部收入捐给湖北疫区。
In February, Portia Time's WeGame sales doubled compared to January, and Steam's side improved slightly, but the boost did not add to Pasqua's income - after they announced they would donate all proceeds from the Steam and WeGame platforms in February to Hubei affected areas.
“大概有40多万吧。
'About four hundred thousand.
”邓永进说，“每多一份收入，就相当于可以多捐一些钱。
"Every extra income is equivalent to giving more money," Deng said.
”。
"
“发国难财”仿佛悬在游戏行业头上的一把剑。
"Development of national wealth" is like a sword hanging over the head of the game industry.
每个人都担心此时的利好新闻会被过度解读，尽管他们也不能明确指出“过度解读”的人在哪里。
Everyone fears that the good news at this time will be over-interpreted, though they can't pinpoint where the "over-interpreted" person is.
偶尔他们也会意识到，不是所有行业都需要如此小心翼翼，但他们的态度仍然不变：至少在游戏这一行，小心谨慎永远是必要的。
Occasionally they realize that not all industries need to be so careful, but their attitudes remain the same: caution is always necessary, at least in the game business.

“项目上的事，多多少少会有些推迟。
"Things on the project are going to be a little bit delayed.
”王宇说。
'said Wang.
尽管是大厂，但他一直在一个老项目组里，和那些烈火烹油般的头部游戏一直保持着距离。
Despite his big factory, he has been on an old project team, distancing himself from the fiery head games.
放假前，他正在为海外版做更新，整个团队大概要同时推进10个小项目，其中推迟的有两三个。
Before the vacation, he was updating the overseas edition, and the team was probably working on 10 small projects at a time, two or three of which were delayed.
王宇觉得，这种影响不算很大，或者说现在还看不出来，要等到真正上班之后才知道。
Wang felt that the effect was not so great, or so far, that it would not be known until after he actually went to work.
。
.
在大厂里，推迟的主要是开发量大的项目，还有所谓“预研项目”，已经上线、准备上线和过了密集开发期的游戏，大多还在按部就班地运行。
In large factories, the delay has been mainly in the development of large-scale projects, and so-called "pre-research projects," which are already online, ready to go online and after a period of intensive development, most of which are still on track.
杨明说，她负责运营的几个游戏，春节期间原本就没有安排大型重要活动，当时考虑的是一旦出了大Bug没人修，现在看来，这也成了一种优势。
Ms. Yang says she ran several games where no major events were scheduled during the Spring Festival, thinking it would be an advantage if the Big Bug didn't get repaired.
。
.
高洋和他的同事们在春节前做完了《剑与远征》公测宣发活动。
Gao Yang and his colleagues completed the "Sword and Expedition" test campaign before the Spring Festival.
由于广告投放力度大，有玩家向他抱怨，怎么哪儿哪儿都能看到你们的广告？。
As a result of the strong investment in advertising, there are players to complain to him, how can you see your advertising everywhere?
原定的市场计划没有推迟。
The original marketing plan was not delayed.
3月到4月，高洋他们要开始筹备下一轮推广，受疫情影响最明显的反而是主播接单和推广内容——那些“恰饭”的主播们假如出不了门，拍不了Vlog，要用什么来替代？。
From March to April, as they begin to prepare for the next round of promotions, the epidemic's most obvious impact will be on broadcast orders and promotional content - what will replace "just-in-time" anchormen who cannot get out of their homes and shoot Vlog?
比起大厂手游的按部就班，主机、单机游戏的危机感更强。
Compared to the step-by-step tour of large factories, mainframe, single game sense of crisis is stronger.
。
.
帕斯亚科技预计在2020年5月、8月发布两个新游戏。
Pasqua is expected to launch two new games in May and August 2020.
现在看来，5月的估计要延期，8月的也称不上乐观。
It now appears that the estimate for May will be extended and that for August will not be optimistic.
游戏一旦延期，最坏的状况是有可能拖到明年。
If the game is postponed, the worst-case scenario could be put off until next year.
这里面有时间的原因，但更重要的是单机游戏本身的生存状态并不算好。
There is a reason for the time, but more importantly, the survival of the game itself is not good.
。
.
疫情期间，只有手办们守护着空无一人的办公室。
During the outbreak, only handlers guarded the empty office.
“国产单机游戏每年的窗口期太短了。
"Homemade singleton games have too little window time each year.
”邓永进感慨。
"Deng Yongjin sigh.
一年看似很长，但留给新游戏上市的时间往往只有两三个月。
A year may seem long, but new games are often only two or three months old.
5月和8月是邓永进团队深思熟虑之后的结果。
May and August were the result of a thoughtful effort by Deng Yongjin's team.
“假如我们5月上一个新游戏，6月初有E3，6月中下旬是夏促，夏促结束差不多是7月中，我们再在8月初上一个新游戏，这个节奏是比较好的。
"It would be better if we had a new game in May, E3 in early June, summer in late June, summer in mid-July, and a new game in early August.
”邓永进说，如果第一个游戏5月发不了，就只能延到8月，到时候宣传资源会分散，但也不能再拖下去。
'If the first game doesn't start in May, it can only be postponed until August, when publicity resources will spread, but they can't be delayed any longer, 'Mr. Deng said.
“每年10月到12月不是大作首发就是冬促，国产单机游戏能获得多少关注呢？”。
"October to December of each year is either a major starter or a winter shortcut, how much attention can be paid to home-made single games?"
罗翔宇也遇到了同样的问题。
Luo Xiang-woo had the same problem.
铃空目前研发的2个项目，都是PS4和下一世代主机上的游戏。
Suzuki is currently developing two projects, both PS4 and the next generation of games on the mainframe.
其中一个已经开发了4年多，成本几千万，原计划今年上半年开始宣传，年内发售。
One, which has been under development for more than four years and cost tens of millions of dollars, was originally planned to be launched in the first half of this year.
但在疫情之下，他们原定参加3月的PAX、GDC，现在都去不了了。
But in the face of the epidemic, they were scheduled to attend the PAX, GDC in March, and are now unable to go.
3月12日，E3主办方ESA宣布展会取消。
March 12, the E3 organizer ESA announced the cancellation of the exhibition.
。
.
“不仅是我们，”罗翔宇说，“新闻里不是说很多大厂也不去了吗？那里面有不少都是我们的合作伙伴。
"It's not just us," said Luo Xiangyu. "Isn't it true that many big factories don't go? There are many of them partners.
”。
"
上不了展前发布会，罗翔宇还在联系其他平台和发行商，尝试参加线上直面会。
Unable to attend the pre-exhibition conference, Luo Xiangyu is also contacting other platforms and distributors to try to attend the online face-to-face meeting.
改变渠道也好，寻找其他途径也好，游戏总要继续下去。
Change the channel or look for other ways, the game will continue.
。
.
4个月前，罗翔宇提交了《临终：重生试炼》手游版的审批材料，正在等待版号。
Four months ago, Luo Xiangyu submitted the approval materials for the handwritten edition of "Death: The Trial of Rebirth," which is awaiting the release number.
实际上，游戏已经发售两年半多，在其他平台上卖得还不错，打折季一个月能卖出几千份。
In fact, the game has been on sale for more than two and a half years, in other platforms sold well, discount season can sell thousands of copies a month.
有玩家找到他吐槽，怎么每次打折都能看见你们那个鱼头（《临终：重生试炼》的宣传Logo）？这让他觉得，现在也还行，版号什么时候过，就先等着吧。
How can you see your fish head on every sale? It makes him feel like it's OK now, just wait until the release number has passed.
。
.
但不是所有人都能等。
But not everyone can wait.
帕斯亚的两个新游戏除了Steam之外，还要上WeGame平台，必须获得版号。
In addition to Steam, Pasia's two new games have a WeGame platform and must have a version number.
但受疫情影响，能申请版号的代理、出版社也推迟复工。
But affected by the epidemic, can apply for version number agent, publishing house also delayed resumption of work.
不送审，审批也就无从谈起。
Without trial, there is no question of review and approval.
邓永进乐观估计，即使现在送审，至少也要4个月以上的时间才能批下来。
Mr Deng reckons optimistically that it will take at least four months to get the case ready for trial, even now.
。

2月25日，苹果公司向中国大陆游戏开发者发布公告，要求他们在6月30日前提交“计划在中国大陆发布的任何付费游戏或可提供App内购买项目的游戏的批准文号”。
On Feb. 25, Apple issued a notice to game developers in mainland China asking them to submit by June 30 "the approval number of any paid games planned to be released in mainland China or games that can provide App purchases."
经验老到的张雯雯只看了一眼就明白，渠道应该是收到了什么新消息。
Experienced Zhang Wenwen only looked at it and knew that the channel should be receiving some new information.
。
.
苹果公司的要求。
Apple's request.
■ 前路茫茫。
▪ The road ahead is vast.
张雯雯仍在每天关注疫情，她对疫情的关注大多与工作挂钩：“两会”有没有延期？疫情过后，有关部门对游戏有没有新政策？“这次疫情里，受影响的绝不只是游戏行业。
Zhang Wenwen is still paying attention to the epidemic every day. Her concern about the epidemic is mostly related to her work. Has the NPC been extended? Has there been any new policy on games since the outbreak?
”她笃定地说。
'she said firmly.
。
.
2月里，一些“鼓励网络文化消费”的新闻被视为面向游戏行业的利好消息。
In February, some of the news "encouraging consumption of online culture" was seen as good news for the gaming industry.
2月19日，北京市相关部门在新闻发布会上表示：“网络游戏、网络教育、数字音乐等新的文化技术融合形式受到公众的广泛关注和喜爱，成为文化消费的新热点。
"Online games, online education, digital music and other new forms of cultural and technological integration have attracted wide public attention and become a new hotspot in cultural consumption," Beijing authorities said at a press conference on Feb. 19.
”此后，北京市将采取多项措施，支持电子竞技发展。
Since then, Beijing has taken several measures to support the development of e-sports.
。
.
面对利好消息，游戏人的反应仍然小心翼翼。
In the face of good news, the game people are still cautious response.
他们重复得最多的一个词，是“谨慎”。
The word they repeat the most is "caution."
“我们看到一条信息，最先想到的其实是负面的部分，是那些潜在的东西。
"When we see a message, the first thing we think about is the negative, the potential.
”张雯雯解释道，“比如鼓励网络文化消费，那么未成年人消费怎么办？这可是国家去年很重视的。
"For example, encouraging consumption of culture on the Internet, what about consumption by minors?
”。
"
邓永进还没想得这么具体，但他也有种直觉，有关部门下达一条精神，转变成政策之后，到底是否真的能从中获益，一开始很难去预判。
Deng didn't want to be so specific, but he also had a hunch that it was hard to predict whether the authorities would actually benefit from the policy once it had been translated into policy.
。
.
罗翔宇对“利好消息”的反应也不太乐观。
Luo Xiangyu's reaction to the "good news" is not very optimistic either.
他预测，即使疫情结束，国家也不会因为游戏吃到了红利就放宽政策。
He predicts that even if the epidemic is over, the country will not relax because the game has paid dividends.
。
.
“中国手游增长那么快，市场规模那么大，但这几年版号说限就限，说明也不是很看重这方面经济上的影响吧。
"China's hand travel is growing so fast and the market is so large, but these few years the number limit is limited, the explanation is not very important in this regard economic impact.
”。
"
罗翔宇和张雯雯都很关注去年年底游戏产业年会上，由中国音像与数字出版协会（音数协）提出的一些新动向。
Lo Xiangyu and Zhang Wenwen were following the latest developments proposed by the Chinese Association for Audio-Visual and Digital Publishing (APAA) at the end of last year's annual games industry conference.
当时会议上，“游戏适龄”是一个重点，国内两家游戏大厂都拿出了供人研讨的方案。
At that time, the "game age" is a key, the two major domestic game factories have come up with a solution for people to discuss.
。
.
张雯雯觉得，今年的重心应该还是游戏适龄，“总不可能去年年底刚提，今年就没下文了吧”。
Zhang Wenwen thinks, this year's center of gravity should be the right age, "always impossible last year just mentioned, this year did not follow up on it."
在她看来，即使目前公开的信息不多，但等到疫情结束，最先被提上日程的很可能仍然是未成年人保护、实名认证等内容，而苹果的“6月30日期限”或许也是链条上的一部分。
In her view, even if there is little information currently on the table, it is likely that the first thing on the agenda when the epidemic is over is protection of minors, real-name authentication, and Apple's "June 30 deadline" may be part of the chain.
。
.
2019年，“游戏适龄”是游戏行业中的热门话题之一。
In 2019, "game age" is one of the hottest topics in the game industry.
■ 等待春天。
▪ Waiting for spring.
去年9月，帕斯亚科技在重庆市中心租了一整层办公楼，和原来相比，新办公室面积扩大了几倍，租金也从每平方米20元涨到了100元。
In September, Pasia leased a full floor office building in the heart of the city, several times the original office space and the rent rose from $20 to $100 per square metre.
邓永进解释，这是让老员工上下班更方便，对公司也有不少帮助。
Deng Yongjin explains, this is to let old employee commute more convenient, also have a lot of help to the company.
“以前我们在老办公楼，有人来面试，刚到楼下就扭头走了。
"We used to be in the old office building and someone came to the interview and just turned around when we got downstairs.
我等了半天，打电话过去问，人家说，对不起，不来了。
I waited a long time, called to ask, people said, sorry, not coming.
”。
"
新办公室、新项目，还有越来越多的人，给帕斯亚带来了不少资金压力。
New offices, new projects, and a growing number of people are putting a lot of financial strain on Pasqua.
同样是去年，他们接受了腾讯的投资。
It was also last year that they accepted Tencent's investment.
回想起来，邓永进有些庆幸。
In retrospect, Deng Yongjin was lucky.
有了这笔钱，加上《波西亚时光》的盈利，支撑目前的项目不是问题。
With that money, plus Portia Time's earnings, supporting the current project is not a problem.
。
.
“单机游戏的盈利能力比网游差很多。
"Single-player games are much less profitable than online games.
”邓永进说。
"said Deng.
如果今年两个新游戏能顺利上线，应该还能赚出一两年的工资。
If two new games go online this year, they should still earn a year or two.
假如上不了，情况就会有些吃紧。
If you can't get there, things will get a little tight.
而一系列受疫情影响的延迟并不仅限于单机游戏，邓永进担心，今年所有游戏的宣发周期都要缩短，原本可能有12个月，现在要减到10个月、9个月，各种游戏挤在一起，竞争肯定更激烈。
The delay in getting caught up in the epidemic is not limited to single-player games, and Deng worries that all the games this year, which could have lasted 12 months, will have to be shortened to 10 or 9 months, with games packed together and surely competing more fiercely.
一些小公司可能坚持不下来。
Some small companies may not stick it out.
。
.
对于莉莉丝来说，抗风险不是问题。
For Lilith, risk aversion is not the problem.
高洋认为，大厂和中型公司在经济上受的影响不会太大，小型工作室就不太好说。
Big and medium-sized companies aren't going to get much of an economic impact, Gao says. Smaller studios aren't so easy to say.
但另一方面，游戏和其他行业也并非毫无关联，已经有人开始调研，疫情会如何影响经济，这种影响又会如何辐射到玩家。
On the other hand, gaming and other industries are not unrelated, and research has begun into how the epidemic will affect the economy and how it will radiate to players.
。
.
习惯了大厂生活，远程办公让人们感受到了家庭的重要。
Accustomed to the big factory life, telecommuting lets people feel the importance of the family.
“人生不易，又一个人离家在外，就特别想组建自己的家庭，”王宇说，“我想要一个温暖的避风港。
"Life is not easy, another person left home, especially want to form their own family," said Wang Yu, "I want a warm haven.
”。
"
张雯雯本来计划好了要去旅游，随着疫情扩散，她放弃了旅游的想法，发自内心地想要回家多陪陪父母。
Zhang Wenwen had planned to travel, but as the epidemic spread, she gave up the idea of traveling and really wanted to go home with her parents.
。
.
罗翔宇仍然觉得“要多看看好的方面”。
Luo Xiang-woo still felt "need to see more of the good".
时间一天天过去，不同的人和事在他身边流淌而过，他站在漩涡中心，开始用不同的角度审视游戏与生活的关系。
As the days passed and different people and events flowed past him, he stood at the center of the whirlpool and began to look at the relationship between play and life in a different light.
。

“我们体验到了许多人体验不到的东西，这种独特的经历，希望它能对未来的创作有帮助吧。
"We've experienced something that many people don't experience, and it's a unique experience, and hopefully it's going to help in the future.
”罗翔宇说。
