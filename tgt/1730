疫情危机再一次提醒我们，在公共卫生方面，从政府、社会到公众，我们还有很多功课未能完成。
The epidemic once again reminds us that we still have a long way to go when it comes to public health, from government to society to the general public.
作者 | 朱纪明 程峰（清华大学医学院公共健康研究中心）编辑 | 徐菁菁药物和疫苗不一定“特效”身在疫情中，大众的期待是特效药和疫苗。
Not necessarily "special effects" in the epidemic, as Chu Ji-ming, editor and director of the Center for Public Health Research at Tsinghua University School of Medicine, expects specific drugs and vaccines.
面对疾病，这是人们自然的第一反应。
In the face of disease, this is a natural first reaction.
但如果从健康经济学的视角回顾一下历史，以公共卫生的角度看，药物和疫苗并不一定“特效”。
But if you look at history from the perspective of health economics, drugs and vaccines are not necessarily "special effects" from a public health perspective.
下图描述的是四种传染病死亡率的变迁。
The graph below depicts the evolution of mortality from the four infectious diseases.
麻疹、猩红热与伤寒“特效药或疫苗”的姗姗来迟，对其导致的人口死亡率的整体降低作用几近于零。
Measles, scarlet fever, and typhoid fever are long overdue, and the overall reduction in mortality is close to zero.

The Questionable Contribution of Medical Measures to theDecline of Mortality in the United States in the Twentieth Century. The MilbankMemorial Fund Quarterly. Health and Society 1977; 55: 405-28.）历史告诉我们，在大多数情况下，有效的医学干预手段（effective medical intervention）通常是在人口死亡率大幅下降后才出现。
Figure 1: Standardized mortality per 1,000 population for the four infectious diseases in the United States (from Folland S. Goodman A, Standard M. The Economics of Health and Healthcare, 7th Edition. Upper Saddle River: Pearson Education, Inc., 2013, p. 90.
很多知名的学者针对医疗服务（medical care）对健康贡献的研究结果是令人惊讶的——医疗服务对健康的贡献在10%左右，高一点的估计也不过是20%（McGovernet al, 2014）。
The results of many leading scholars on the contribution of medical care to health are surprising - the contribution of health services to health is around 10%, and a slightly higher estimate is only 20% (McGovernet et al., 2014).
我们不是想渲染医学研究与实践不重要，相反，它极其重要和有价值。
We are not trying to overstate that medical research and practice are not important; on the contrary, they are extremely important and valuable.
但认识医学与科学的局限性，也是重要的科学素养；认识到人类的无知与渺小，反而是我们获取智慧与力量的第一步。
But understanding the limitations of medicine and science is also an important scientific accomplishment; recognizing the ignorance and littleness of human beings is the first step to gain wisdom and strength.
汉阳医院，无处可去的患者在路边打吊瓶。
Hanyang Hospital, nowhere to go for patients hanging bottles by the side of the road.
| 黄宇 摄我们必须承认的事实是，面对疾病，人们首先想到的是“征服”，然而，连很多人都不以为然的“流感”也从未被“征服”。
What we must admit is that, in the face of disease, people think first of all of "conquest," yet even the "flu," which many people dislike, has never been "conquered."
两年前，一篇网络纪实红文《流感下的北京中年》记录了一名患者的经历。
Two years ago, an online documentary, "Middle-aged Beijing with Influenza," recorded the experiences of a patient.
从吹风、“感冒流涕”，最终他也采用了这些天在疫情消息中多次被提及的“体外膜肺氧合”（简称ECMO）抢救，历时29天仍然撒手人寰的故事。
From the hairdryer, "cold runny nose," he finally used the "external membrane oxygenation" (ECMO) rescue, referred to many times in the outbreak news these days, and died 29 days later.
事实上，严谨的研究显示中国每年流感相关超额呼吸系统疾病死亡人数（Influenza-associated excess respiratory deaths）是8.4万到9.2万（Li et al, 2019），全球每年流感相关呼吸系统疾病死亡人数（influenza-associated respiratory deaths）的估算是29万到65万（Iuliano et al, 2018）。
Indeed, rigorous studies show that the annual number of deaths from influenza-related excess respiratory diseases in China is between 84,000 and 92,000 (Li et al., 2019), and the annual global number of deaths from influenza-related respiratory diseases is estimated at 290,000 to 650,000 (Iuliano et al., 2018).
如果没有现在的新冠肺炎，恐怕很少有人会关注这些流感死亡数据，哪怕它们从一些维度看比新冠肺炎更惊人。
Without the new crown pneumonia, few people would have looked at the death toll, even if they were more striking in some dimensions than the new crown pneumonia.
略有讽刺意味的是，这些研究本来是提醒我们注重防控的，但是现在却反过来被用于安抚我们的恐惧。
Ironically, these studies, which were supposed to remind us to focus on prevention and control, are now being used instead to assuage our fears.
既然医疗服务对健康的贡献只占10%，那其它的健康决定因素是什么？研究表明行为（behavior）对健康贡献占40%左右（Mcginnis et al, 2002）。
Since health services contribute only 10% to health, what are the other determinants of healthResearch shows that behavior contributes about 40% to health (McGinnis et al., 2002).
例如，吸烟是一种行为，相当一部分公共卫生专业人士从事控烟工作，权威研究亦显示烟草对死亡的贡献高达18%（Mokdadet al, 2004）。
For example, smoking is a behaviour in which a significant proportion of public health professionals are engaged in tobacco control, and authoritative studies show that tobacco contributes up to 18 per cent of deaths (Mokdadet et al., 2004).
我不用查任何文献，也可以自信地讲，烟草每天杀死的中国人，都远远高于这次疫情目前的死亡总人数。
I don't need to look up any literature, and I can confidently say that tobacco kills far more Chinese people every day than the current total number of deaths from the epidemic.
在疫情的发展阶段，我们尚无有力的证据建立起新冠肺炎与吸烟之间的关联。
At this stage of the epidemic, there is no strong evidence of a link between pneumonia and smoking.
不过，《柳叶刀》（The Lancet）上的一篇文章，对武汉金银潭医院在1月1日至20日期间收治的99位患者的数据进行了描述性分析，最先病逝的两名患者都有长期吸烟史（Chenet al, 2020）。
However, an article in The Lancet provided a descriptive analysis of data on 99 patients treated at Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital between January 1 and 20, both of whom had long-term smoking histories (Chenet al., 2020).
新冠肺炎也是肺炎，讨论肺炎很少提及控烟也就罢了，竟然有不少文章公然宣扬吸烟有助于防范新冠肺炎的诸多“理论”。
New Crown Pneumonia is also pneumonia, and talk of pneumonia rarely mentions tobacco control, and there are plenty of articles openly promoting the "theory" that smoking can help protect against pneumonia.
我们为什么不戒烟、不控制自己的行为、不对自己负责，却一定要求生病后被治愈呢？中国大众习惯了生病直接去大医院的门诊。
Why don't we quit smoking, not control our behavior, not be responsible for ourselves, but must be cured when we fall ill?
此外，我们看病，总喜欢来点儿“实实在在”的东西——例如，开点药、挂个水。
In addition, when we see a doctor, we always like to have something "real" - for example, to prescribe some medicine or hang a water bottle.
我有一个亲戚，有一次我见到他很失落地从医院回来，因为医生没给他开药，他觉得白去看病了。
I have a relative who once came back from the hospital frustrated that the doctor had not prescribed medicine for him. He felt that he had gone to see a doctor for nothing.
是啊，如果医生嘱咐我们多喝水、多休息、注意手卫生、注意打喷嚏礼仪、在家里待着之类，我们觉得这实在不属于什么有效的医疗处方啊。
Yes, if the doctor tells us to drink more water, take more rest, pay attention to hand hygiene, pay attention to sneezing etiquette, stay at home and so on, we don't think it's a valid medical prescription.
终于，有人告诉了我们“双黄连”，总算有点儿“实实在在”的东西了，于是我们戴着口罩、在新冠病毒的威胁下英雄般地挤着长队。
Finally, someone told us that there was something "real" about it, so we wore masks and piled up heroically under the threat of the new crown virus.
疫情危机再一次提醒我们，在公共卫生方面，从政府、社会到公众，我们还有很多功课未能完成。
The epidemic once again reminds us that we still have a long way to go when it comes to public health, from government to society to the general public.
远征 摄我们需要补足的公共卫生课人们翘首期盼科学家在实验室攻克病毒，热血沸腾地看着呼吸、危重症医学、急诊、感染等领域的医生奔赴前线。
Expeditions We Need Complementary Public Health Courses People are eager for scientists to conquer the virus in their labs, watching doctors in the fields of breathing, critical medicine, emergency care, infection and so on come to the front lines.
在危急时刻，公共卫生似乎缺乏存在感。
In times of crisis, public health seems to lack a sense of existence.
民众不明白公共卫生到底是什么，在做什么。
People do not understand what public health is and what it is doing.
事实上，上述我们提到的疾病的防控，行为学，还包括大众的就医行为，都属于公共卫生的范畴。
In fact, the prevention and control of the diseases to which we have referred, behavioral science, and also the behaviour of the general public, fall within the scope of public health.
当前，世界诸多科研团队日夜奋战，希望能够创造在疫情严重暴发期间有疫苗问世并应用的壮观景象。
At present, many research teams around the world are working hard day and night to create a spectacular picture of vaccines being developed and used during severe outbreaks.
抗病毒药物瑞德西韦（Remdesivir）进入临床试验，也给了人们药到病除的希望。
The introduction of the antiviral drug Remdesivir into clinical trials has also given hope of getting rid of the drug.
但回顾非典（SARS）肆虐时，开发疫苗很紧迫，也取得了很多突破。
But looking back at the SARS epidemic, the development of vaccines was urgent, and many breakthroughs were made.
非典过后，特效药和疫苗的开发似乎没有用了，开发出来也没有市场，没有任何经济激励机制，于是很多研究没有继续下去，现在看来可能是非常可惜的。
After SARS, the development of specific drugs and vaccines seemed useless, there was no market for them, there was no economic incentive, so much research did not continue, and it may now seem a pity.
从卫生政策的角度，这需要政府的战略投入与支持。
From the perspective of health policy, this requires strategic input and support from the Government.
这次的新冠肺炎发生了多起医院院内感染。
There have been many hospital infections with the new crown pneumonia.
这涉及职业健康和医院管理，这些都属于公共卫生的领域。
This relates to occupational health and hospital management, which fall within the area of public health.
在新冠肺炎疫情中，我们也看到一些人忘记了人本性的真善美，粗暴地查武汉车、围堵武汉人，引发人们对伦理的担忧。
In the New Crown Pneumonia outbreak, we also saw some people forget the true nature of the human nature, rudely check Wuhan cars, block Wuhan people, arouse people's ethical concerns.
伦理问题也是公共卫生的重要研究领域之一，重大公共卫生危机处理的每一个决定都充斥着伦理权衡。
Ethics is also one of the important fields of public health research, and every decision to deal with major public health crises is fraught with ethical trade-offs.
特别需要关注的是，公共卫生注重建立完整的医疗健康服务体系。
Of particular concern is the public health focus on the establishment of a comprehensive health-care delivery system.
我国正在回顾始于2009年的新一轮医改成就，近十年医改评估的一个巨大反思是基础医疗（primary care）的薄弱（Yip et al, 2019）。
China is looking back at a new round of health-care reform efforts that began in 2009, and one of the great rethinking of health-care reform in the last decade has been the weakness of basic care (Yip et al., 2019).
大部分优质医疗资源在三级医院，这样的现实同上述就医行为相互强化，民众习惯了跳过基础医疗，直接去三级医院。
The fact that the majority of quality medical resources are in level III hospitals is mutually reinforcing with the above-mentioned practice, whereby the population is accustomed to skipping basic care and going directly to level III hospitals.
医疗服务与就医行为处在一种无序的状态。
Medical service and medical treatment are in a disorderly state.
武汉方舱医院医护人员 | 远征 摄我国的公共卫生与临床缺乏合作和协调。
Wuhan Fangkang Hospital & # 144; & # 45; Expedition The lack of cooperation and coordination between public health and clinic in China.
近几年建立了很多健康管理项目，各种体检机构更是如雨后春笋般涌现。
In recent years, many health management programs have been set up, and various medical check-ups have sprung up.
健康管理，预防，筛查，都是美妙的公共卫生字眼。
Health management, prevention, screening, are all wonderful words of public health.
然而，公卫中真正意义上的筛查（screening）并不仅仅是一个检测（test）。
However, real screening in public defenders is not just a test.
如果不同临床结合，所谓的“筛查”没有跟进，没有诊断与有效的干预，很多筛查可能不仅没用，而且有害。
If different clinical combinations are involved, so-called "screening" is not followed up, and without diagnosis and effective intervention, many screenings may not only be ineffective, but also harmful.
我们很多公卫服务中“筛查”出来的问题，需要患者自己去评估，自己去四处找医院、找医生。
Many of our public health services "screening" out of the problem, the need for patients to assess their own, to find hospitals, find doctors.
这样的公卫是绵软无力的。
Such public health is soft and weak.
总之，我们缺乏的是一个以人为中心的整合型医疗健康服务体系。
In short, what we lack is a people-centred, integrated health-care delivery system.
这样无序的体系造成了效率的损失与沉重的负担，最终既没有患者满意度又缺乏疗效。
Such a disorderly system results in a loss of efficiency and a heavy burden, and ultimately neither patient satisfaction nor efficacy.
我们仔细梳理上文中提到的《流感下的北京中年》会发现，患者29天竟然辗转了五家医院，需要自己协调床位、陪护，甚至一些设备和药物（例如监护仪和达菲）、还有水深的“献血”等一系列问题。
We combed the above-mentioned book "Middle-aged Beijing with Influenza" and found that patients had to co-ordinate their beds, escort and even equipment and drugs (such as monitors and Tamiflu), as well as deep-water "blood donations," to run through five hospitals in 29 days.
最后花费至少38万元（我们研究的估算），患者依然离世，就连去世后是走殡仪馆还是太平间等问题都仍然混乱不堪。
The final cost was at least $380,000 (the estimate of our study), and the patient is still dead, with questions like whether to go to the mortuary or the morgue after death.
这是支离破碎的医疗健康服务体系日常的生动写照，与今天新冠肺炎疫情初期就诊的诸多情形如出一辙。
It is a vivid daily portrayal of the fragmented health-care system, much as it was in the early days of today's SARS outbreak.
武汉是有很多引以为豪的三甲医院的，可再强大的三甲医院，没有有质量的基础医疗分担，没有整合型的医疗体系有序协作，面对一个人口基数超过纽约与伦敦的特大型都市，其脆弱性可想而知。
Wuhan is home to many of the world's most proud triple-A hospitals, with no quality primary care sharing, no integrated health-care system, and a population base that exceeds that of megacities in New York and London.
这么多患者挤在大医院的门诊是非常危险的，对医护人员也是毁灭性的打击。
So many patients crowded into out-patient clinics in major hospitals are dangerous and devastating for health care workers.
而且，已有上千床甚至上万床的巨无霸三甲医院也无法接收这么多的患者。
Moreover, the massive triple-A hospital, which already has thousands of beds or tens of thousands of beds, cannot take in so many patients.
出于无奈，定点医院只能接收重症患者；很多患者虽然经过”筛查“，但在这个体系中依然如同大排档的消费者，很多轻症患者成了新冠病毒“移动传染源”。
Out of desperation, the designated hospital can only accept patients with serious illness; many patients, although "screened", but the system is still like the rank and file of consumers, many patients become the new crown virus "mobile source of infection."
于是，越来越多的人变成了轻症患者，越来越多的轻症患者变成了重症患者。
As a result, more and more people become light cases, and more and more light cases become serious patients.
疫时的混乱只是医疗健康服务体系与相应的就医行为在一个月内集中的呈现。
The disorder during the epidemic is only a concentrated manifestation of the health service system and the corresponding medical treatment behavior within a month.
1月底，武汉大学中南医院急救中心接收的新冠肺炎重病号。
At the end of January, Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital emergency center received serious cases of new crown pneumonia.
| 蔡小川 摄同样，当疫情已经爆发，一个医院主导的体系的第一思路依然是建大医院。
Similarly, when the outbreak began, the first idea of a hospital-led system was to build a large hospital.
当然，在现有的体系下，疫情已经进展到这一步，建各种小汤山医院也是必要的。
Of course, under the current system, the epidemic has advanced to this point, the establishment of the various Xiaotangshan Hospital is also necessary.
建大医院的速度令世界叹为观止，但重新反思医疗服务体系，需要的是一个有序、有层级的完整体系与网络来对抗任何疾病流行和爆发。
The speed with which major hospitals are being built is astonishing to the world, but rethinking the health-care system requires an orderly, hierarchical, integrated system and network to combat any epidemic or outbreak.
在疫情初期经历了对大医院及其医护人员难以承受的冲击后，武汉动员社区，力图开展分级诊疗，之后又建立方舱医院。
In the early stage of the epidemic experienced a major hospital and its staff can not bear the impact, Wuhan mobilized the community, try to carry out graded diagnosis and treatment, and then set up a hospital.
这些重大的举措对遏制疫情蔓延起到重要作用，践行了公共卫生与基础医疗的很多理念。
These major initiatives have played an important role in containing the spread of the epidemic and have embodied many of the concepts of public health and primary health care.
方舱医院是由会展中心、体育馆等临时改建，一天就可以建好，它当然在很多功能上难以媲美传染病专科医院。
Fang Cao Hospital is a temporary renovation of the Convention and Exhibition Center, gymnasium, etc., can be built in a day, of course, it is difficult to compare in many functions with infectious disease hospitals.
但是，它事实上在疫时提供了基础医疗（primary care）。
But it did in fact provide primary care during the epidemic.

| 远征 摄终于，整个医疗健康服务体系变得有序了，基层社区全面“筛查”，方舱医院负责轻症患者，定点医院救治重症患者。
At last, the entire health-care system was orderly, with grass-roots communities being "screened" across the board, with Fang's hospital taking care of light patients and visiting hospitals for serious cases.
建立这样一个整合型应急医疗健康服务体系，付出了巨大的代价，唯望这些理念可以在疫情结束后继续保留在我们日常运营的医疗健康服务体系中。
Creating such an integrated emergency health-care system comes at a huge cost, in the hope that these ideas will survive the epidemic in the health-care system that we run on a daily basis.
