_气溶胶、消化道是否为传播途径在新冠肺炎疫情中牵动人心，在等待医学界给出明确答案时，必要的防护仍是关键，但防护过度则大可不必_文 |《财经》记者 信娜孙爱民 实习记者 朱贺图 |李斯洋编辑 | 王小 马克新冠肺炎病毒可通过“气溶胶”传播。
Whether the _ aerosol, alimentary tract is a route of transmission - while waiting for a clear answer from the medical community, the necessary protection is still crucial. But overprotection may not be necessary. Caijing's Sinai Sun Aimin intern Zhu Hatu & # 44; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
2020年2月8日，上海市民政局副局长曾群在上海市疫情防控工作领导小组新闻发布会上释放的这一信息，令不少民众一度陷入恐慌，着急封堵家里下水道并封闭门窗，据称这样可以减少气溶胶传播病毒风险。
On February 8, 2020, Zeng Qun, deputy director of the Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau, released the information at a press conference of the Shanghai Leading Group on Prevention and Control of the Outbreak, causing many people to panic for a time, blocking domestic sewers and shutting doors and windows, allegedly to reduce the risk of aerosol transmission.
但在2月9日的国务院联防联控机制新闻发布会上，中国疾控中心传染病预防控制处研究员冯录召回应：目前，没有证据显示新冠病毒可通过气溶胶传播。
But at a press conference of the State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism on February 9, Feng Luo-nang, a researcher with the Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Division of the China CDC, recalled that there is no evidence that the new crown virus can be transmitted via aerosols.
这之前，新冠病毒已确定的传播途径，主要是呼吸道飞沫和接触传播。
Prior to this, the new crown virus has been identified by the transmission route, mainly respiratory droplets and contact transmission.
前者指病毒可随着人咳嗽、打喷嚏时呼出的飞沫转移；后者发生的条件是，接触到携带新冠病毒的物体，比如门把手等。
The former refers to the movement of viruses in droplets exhaled when a person coughs or sneezes; the latter occurs when an object carrying a new crown virus, such as a doorknob, is contacted.
戴口罩、勤洗手、勤消毒可阻截这两种传播途径。
Wearing masks, washing hands frequently and disinfecting frequently can stop both ways of transmission.
相比两者，气溶胶在传播时间和距离上都是胜者。
Compared to both, aerosols are winners in terms of time and distance of propagation.
气溶胶，是悬浮在大气中的微小颗粒。
Aerosols are tiny particles suspended in the atmosphere.
我们熟知的霾就算是一种气溶胶。
The haze as we know it is an aerosol.
气溶胶颗粒越小，在空中悬浮时间越久，借着风力也走得更远，这意味着病毒挟气溶胶之力会更持久，能传播的更远。
The smaller the aerosol particles, the longer they remain suspended in the air, and the longer they travel by wind, meaning that the aerosol-carrying power of the virus will last longer and spread farther.
不过，对于新冠病毒是否可通过气溶胶传播在学界仍存争议。
However, whether the new crown virus can be transmitted by aerosol remains controversial in academia.
“由上海市民政部门来发布这么重要的判断，不太严谨。
"It is not very strict for the Shanghai civil affairs department to issue such an important judgment.
”一名公共卫生领域专家告诉《财经》记者，这关乎全社会防疫措施与民众的心理，需要严格的科学验证，新冠病毒的飞沫传播与直接接触传播，都是在临床上得到验证的，气溶胶传播的效应需要更多的研究结果后才应对公众发布，而且应由国家级的机构发布。
A public health expert told Caijing that it was a matter of social immunization and people's psychology, that strict scientific verification was needed, that droplet transmission and direct contact transmission of the new crown virus were clinically proven, and that aerosol transmission effects needed more research before they were released to the public and should be published by national agencies.
2月9日，国家卫健委发布《新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎诊疗方案》（试行第五版修正版），对病毒传播途径中表述为，“气溶胶和消化道等传染途径尚待明确”。
February 9, the National Fitness and Health Commission issued the "New Coronavirus Infection Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Program" (trial version of the 5th revised version), expressing the view that "the route of transmission of the virus, such as aerosols and alimentary canal, remains unclear."
早在1月22日，国家卫健委高级别专家组成员、中国工程院院士李兰娟对《杭州日报》曾提及新冠病毒的气溶胶传播，“病毒在呼吸道繁殖，通过飞沫、气溶胶传播，我们现在还在进行血液、粪便等传播途径的研究”。
As early as January 22, Li Lanjuan, a member of the high-level group of experts of the National Fitness and Health Commission and a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, told Hangzhou Daily that the virus propagates in the respiratory tract, via droplets and aerosols.
当时的判断依据是什么？目前是否有相关的研究进展？李兰娟婉拒了《财经》记者的采访。
What was the basis of the judgment at that time? Is there any relevant research progress? Li Lanjuan declined to be interviewed by Caijing.
在封闭、半封闭空间应谨慎人们的担心不无道理，如果新冠病毒果真能通过气溶胶传播，阻截起来只会更难。
There is reason to be wary in enclosed, semi-enclosed spaces. If the new crown virus does travel via aerosols, it will only be harder to intercept.
北京大学环境科学与工程学院教授要茂盛告诉《财经》记者，“应警惕封闭与半封闭空间中气溶胶传播的作用。
"Beware of aerosol propagation in enclosed and semi-enclosed spaces," Professor Mao Shing told Caijing.
”气溶胶的来源颇广，呼吸、咳嗽、吐痰、呕吐、大小便（水冲洗）等，均可产生。
Aerosols come from a wide range of sources, including breathing, coughing, spitting, vomiting, and defecation (water rinsing).
当气溶胶中含有细菌等单细胞生物，便可为病毒提供可以吸附、存活的宿主，这样病毒的存活时间就延长了。
When aerosols contain single-celled organisms such as bacteria, they can provide a host for viruses to adsorb and survive, thus prolonging the virus's survival.
如果处于狭小封闭与半封闭的空间里，气溶胶传播会和飞沫传播一样作用。
If in a small enclosed and semi-enclosed space, aerosol propagation can be as effective as droplet propagation.
要茂盛分析，假设在一个狭小的被感染的病房里，如果有健康人进来，即使戴着口罩，也可能被感染，因为口罩不能完全封闭，病毒气溶胶颗粒有可能通过口罩和鼻梁的缝隙进入人体。
For lush analysis, assume that if a healthy person enters a small, infected ward, even wearing a mask, it may become infected, because the mask cannot be completely sealed and aerosol particles of the virus may enter the body through cracks in the mask and nose.
有人因为确信“新冠肺炎病毒可通过气溶胶传播”，而在网上提出封闭门窗、封闭楼道、封闭下水道的建议。
Some people, convinced that the "new crown pneumonia virus can be transmitted through aerosols," put forward online closed doors and windows, closed corridors, closed sewage recommendations.
要茂盛称，此举 “并无必要“，大部分人开窗透气没有感染的风险。
Mr Maunsell said the move was "unnecessary" and that most people were at no risk of getting infected by opening their windows.
戴口罩主要为防止病毒通过飞沫传播。
Wearing masks mainly to prevent transmission of the virus through droplets.
麻省理工学院（MIT）的Lydia Bourouiba 教授曾抓拍了人打喷嚏后的液滴轨迹，上百微米的大液滴，惯性强，射程虽有两米，但会快速沉降。
Professor Lydia Bourouiba, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), captured the droplet path of a sneeze, a large droplet of 100 microns, with a strong inertia and a range of two meters, but it settles quickly.
几微米的小液滴飞沫，在空气中可瞬间蒸发为微米级颗粒，即飞沫核。
Small droplets of micron droplets evaporate instantly into micron-sized particles in the air, known as droplet nuclei.
这种飞沫核中可携带病毒蛋白质或其他病原体，以气溶胶形式停留在空气中并传播。
The droplets can carry viral proteins or other pathogens that stay in the air in the form of aerosols and spread.
如果新冠病毒可以此方式传播，含有新冠病毒的飞沫核，便可具更广泛的传播力。
If the new crown virus can spread in this way, droplet nuclei containing the new crown virus can spread more widely.
“在室外开放环境下，如果周边没有近距离患者飞沫，健康人感染的几率非常低，比中彩票的几率还低。
"In an open environment, a healthy person is at a very low risk of infection and is less likely to win a lottery if there is no near-by droplet.
”要茂盛分析，需要和患者保持的安全距离，气溶胶中病毒的传播“跟当时患者的防护、健康人的防护、病毒的种类、风向等有关系”。
To be robust, one needs to maintain a safe distance from the patient, and the transmission of the aerosol virus "has to do with the protection of the patient at the time, the protection of a healthy person, the type of virus, the direction of the wind, etc."
抽烟的人已离开，我们却仍能闻到烟味。
The smoker has left, but we can still smell the smoke.
这是因为，烟草燃烧后形成的微小颗粒，可在空气中形成稳定存在的气溶胶，还可随着流动空气飘向他方。
This is because the tiny particles formed by tobacco burning can form stable aerosols in the air and drift away with the flowing air.
颗粒越小的气溶胶，静止在空气中同一高度的停留时间就越长。
The smaller the aerosol, the longer the stationary aerosol stays at the same altitude in the air.
1微米的颗粒，在静止的空气中可悬浮1小时以上。
1 micron particle suspended in still air for more than 1 hour.
含有新冠病毒的飞沫核尺寸在亚微米到微米的范围，按此测算，停留时间只会更长。
The droplet nuclei containing the new cap virus are in the sub-micron to micron range and will only stay longer if measured.
不过，室外环境中，患者咳嗽、说话等喷出来的病毒，很快会被大气稀释，在扩散过程中会衰减，所以浓度会变得很低，病毒活性也可能受到空气污染物的影响。
However, in outdoor environments, viruses such as coughing and talking are quickly diluted into the atmosphere and attenuate in the diffusion process, so concentrations become very low and the virus's activity may be affected by air pollutants.
要茂盛提示，在做好防护措施的前提下，与病毒携带者保持两米之外被感染的风险会很低。
Be sure to keep your risk of getting infected two meters away from the virus carriers, as long as you have the precautions in place.
安全距离与风向也存在关联。
Safe distance is also associated with wind direction.
如果前面有个人抽烟，风向正好是顺风，即使保持两米的距离，可能也会闻到烟味。
If a man smoking in front of him, the wind is just fine with the wind, even if the distance of two meters, may also smell smoke.
所以如果处于下风向，安全距离可能要更远一点。
So if the wind goes down, the safe distance may be a little further.
上述公共卫生领域专家对《财经》记者分析，关于新冠病毒的气溶胶传播途径，很多细节需要研究，“比如气溶胶中含有多少病毒可以致病，气溶胶中病毒的存活时间与载量等”，都还不能确定。
Experts in the public health field have told Caijing that many details need to be worked out about the aerosol transmission route of the new crown virus, "such as how many viruses in the aerosol can cause disease, how long and how long the virus survives in aerosols, and so on.
此前，学术界对于冠状病毒在气溶胶中的传播路径研究很少。
Up to now, there has been little research on the propagation path of coronavirus in aerosol.
英国莱斯特大学的学者于2019年1月《BMC传染病》杂志上一篇综述性论文提及，在空气取样的研究中，的确发现过SARS冠状病毒的核酸，但研究人员并未通过病毒培养来研究其活性。
In a review published in the January 2019 issue of the journal BMC Infectious Diseases, researchers at the University of Leicester in the UK mentioned that nucleic acids from the SARS coronavirus were indeed found in air sampling studies, but the researchers did not study the activity of the coronavirus through virus culture.
这意味着，由此来的病毒是否具有传染性并不明确。
This means that it is not clear whether the resulting virus is contagious.
还有一些研究揭示，与新冠肺炎病毒同属一家的SARS冠状病毒和中东呼吸综合症冠状病毒，空气传播在其传播路径中的比例仍存争议。
Other studies have revealed that the coronavirus SARS coronavirus and the coronavirus of Middle East respiratory syndrome, both of which belong to the same family, remain controversial.
不过，气溶胶传播对于新型冠状病毒的传播判断，并非毫无根据。
However, the transmission of aerosols to the new coronavirus transmission judgment, is not groundless.
2004年，军事医学科学院微生物流行病研究所等机构的研究者，在对某SARS定点收治医院病房区及阳台空气进行样本收集，研究发现，病房区SARS病毒的阳性率为29%，阳台为20%。
In 2004, researchers from the Institute of Microbial Epidemiology of the Academy of Military Medicine and other institutions collected samples from the ward area and balcony air of a designated SARS hospital and found that the positive rate of SARS virus in ward area was 29% and balcony 20%.
进一步研究显示：病毒在距传染源周围1米之内的空气中具有感染活性，在此范围之内存在气溶胶传播的潜在威胁。
Further studies have shown that the virus is infectious in the air within 1 metre of the source of infection and that within this range there is a potential threat of aerosol transmission.
在该研究中，研究者在阳台中取得的样本虽然病毒阳性率达20%，但细胞分离均为阴性。
In the study, researchers took samples from balconies that had a positive rate of 20%, but cell isolation was negative.
研究者推测SARS病毒在空气中可以存活，但对外界的抵抗力较差。
The researchers speculate that the SARS virus can survive in the air but is less resistant to the outside world.
研究者在发表于《中华流行病学杂志》上的论文提示：“我们的实验数据及流行病学资料目前都不支持病原体经空气快速远程传播。
"Our experimental data and epidemiological data do not support rapid long-range airborne transmission of pathogens," the researchers suggest in the Chinese Journal of Epidemiology.
”科学家对于气溶胶中的流感病毒研究较多，可以作为参考。
Scientists have done more research on the influenza virus in aerosols, which can be used as a reference.
一个由美国、日本、中国香港、泰国学者组成的研究组，系统研究了气溶胶传播在A型流感病毒传播中的角色，研究发现，气溶胶传播途径，大约占A型流感病毒传播的一半，这也意味着在室内环境下，只是减少直接接触与较大颗粒的飞沫核传播，是不足以控制A型流感病毒的传播的。
A team of academics from the United States, Japan, Hong Kong, China and Thailand has systematically studied the role of aerosol transmission in the spread of influenza A virus. The study found that aerosol transmission, which accounts for about half of the spread of influenza A virus, also means that in indoor environments, direct contact with larger particles and transmission of droplet nuclei is not sufficient to control the spread of influenza A virus.
2013年发表于Nature Communications上的一篇论文显示：此前有学者假设气溶胶中的流感病毒在高湿度环境中会受到抑制，但香港与曼谷的研究模型证实，香港与曼谷的室内气溶胶是流感病毒传播的主要途径。
According to a paper published in Nature Communications in 2013, influenza viruses in aerosols were previously assumed to be suppressed in high humidity, but models in Hong Kong and Bangkok confirmed that indoor aerosols in Hong Kong and Bangkok were the main routes of influenza virus transmission.
同时，上述研究者通过试验研究发现，在小颗粒气溶胶中的存在流感病毒，仍然具有传染性。
At the same time, the above-mentioned researchers found that the presence of influenza viruses in small particles aerosols is still infectious.
医院急诊室的空气中可以检测到流感病毒核酸。
Flu nucleic acids can be detected in the air in hospital emergency rooms.
这一研究佐证了要茂盛的提示，在封闭和半封闭空间应该更谨慎。
This study supports the suggestion to be lush that there should be more caution in enclosed and semi-enclosed spaces.
2020年2月8日，国家医疗专家组成员、北京地坛医院感染性疾病诊疗与研究中心首席专家李兴旺在国务院新闻发布会上解释称，气溶胶的传播在呼吸道传染病中是可以看到的，但是对于新冠病毒有没有气溶胶传播的情况，目前还不明确。
On February 8, 2020, Li Changsheng, a member of the National Medical Experts Group and chief expert at the Center for Diagnosis and Research of Infectious Diseases at Ditan Hospital in Beijing, explained at a State Council press conference that aerosol transmission is visible in respiratory tract infections, but it is not clear whether the new crown virus has aerosol transmission.
“我们关注到这个现象，但要做更多研究工作，今后有证据时可能会更改传播途径的写法。
"We are concerned about this phenomenon, but more research is needed and the route of transmission may change in the future if there is evidence.
”同日，中国疾控中心传染病预防控制处研究员冯录召在国家卫健委“全力做好新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情防控工作”专题页面中这样回复：新冠肺炎目前还是主要通过飞沫传播和接触传播的疾病；在某些特殊的条件下才可能发生气溶胶传播，例如进行临床气管插管等专业医疗操作时。
On the same day, Feng Lou, a researcher with the Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Division of the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called on the National Fitness and Health Commission to focus on the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia.
完整看待17年前香港淘大花园感染事件与气溶胶传播一样有争议的还有“粪-口传播”。
Just as controversial as aerosol transmission is the "fecal-oral spread" of the Taobao Garden in Hong Kong 17 years ago.
在《新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎诊疗方案》（试行第五版）中，消化道传染途径也是尚待明确。
In the "New Coronavirus Infection Diagnosis and Treatment Programme" (trial version 5), the digestive tract infection route is also unclear.
通过消化道途径传播，常见疾病有甲肝、戊肝等，以及一些寄生虫疾病，其病原体存活于粪便中，如果污染了手或者食物，会病从口入。
Propagation through the digestive tract, common diseases such as hepatitis A and E, as well as a number of parasite diseases whose pathogens live in feces, if contaminated hands or food, will enter the mouth.
虽无定论，但排泄活动中产生的气溶胶仍需警惕。
Although inconclusive, the aerosols produced by excretion activities still require vigilance.
17年前香港淘大花园社区的病毒传播案例就很典型。
The virus spread in Hong Kong's Taobao Garden community 17 years ago is typical.
2003年非典期间，香港淘大花园社区发生了一起“粪-口传播”案例。
During SARS in 2003, a case of "fecal-oral transmission" occurred in the Taobao Garden community in Hong Kong.
一个 SARS 患者上厕所，经污水系统间接引发了超过 300 例感染。
A SARS patient went to the toilet and indirectly caused more than 300 infections through the sewage system.
最终，香港淘大花园E座中，321人感染了SARS病毒，其中42人死亡，气溶胶被认为是此次集体传染的最大祸首。
In the end, 321 people were infected with the SARS virus in Block E of Hong Kong's Taobao Garden, 42 of whom died. Aerosols are believed to be the biggest culprit in the collective infection.
不过，时过多年，至今这起事件的传播途径仍未完全统一。
Over the years, however, the route of transmission of the incident has not yet been fully unified.
中国香港特区政府的调查结果显示，E座的一名SARS患者感染了部分居民，然后通过污水处理系统、人与人传播、电梯和楼梯等公共设施，传播至该座其他居民。
According to the results of the survey conducted by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, a SARS patient in Block E infected some residents and spread to the rest of the population through public facilities such as sewage treatment systems, person-to-person transmission, elevators and staircases.
E座的居民进而通过人与人接触和飞沫传播，将病毒传给其他居民楼。
The inhabitants of Block E, in turn, transmit the virus to other residential buildings through person-to-person contact and foam transmission.
而世界卫生组织（WHO）的调查则显示,该社区居民楼里的垂直污水管道，与马桶、水池、浴缸和浴室地漏等设施进行连接的U 形水槽，由于长期处于无水状态，为病毒传播创造了便利。
A survey by the World Health Organization (WHO) showed that the community's vertical sewers, U-shaped gutters connected to toilets, cisterns, bathtubs and bathroom spillage, facilitated the spread of the virus because of its chronic lack of water.
同时，浴室门后的排气扇，将含有病毒的气溶胶从污水管道吹进浴室、污染了浴室，然后被吹通风井中，实现楼层之间传播。
At the same time, the exhaust fan behind the bathroom door blows virus-containing aerosols from a sewage pipe into the bathroom, contaminating the bathroom, and is blown into a ventilated well to spread from floor to floor.
然而，WHO未能解释从E座到其他居民口的病毒传播路径。
However, the WHO failed to explain the route of transmission from Block E to other populations.
《新英格兰医学》期刊2004年4月发表的一篇论文，研究了香港淘大花园社区的病毒传播路径。
A paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine in April 2004 examined virus transmission pathways in the Taobao Garden community in Hong Kong.
研究者同意WHO的部分假设，认为含有病毒的气溶胶在不同楼层之间进行传播，并认为气溶胶通过通风井上升到E座顶部后，通过东北风传播到B、C、D座。
The researchers agree with some of the WHO hypotheses that virus-containing aerosols travel from floor to floor, and that aerosols propagate from north-east to seats B, C and D when they rise through a vent well to the top of Block E.
不过，在气溶胶产生源头方面，与WHO意见不一——研究者通过在港大的实验发现，气溶胶产生于抽水马桶运作时垂直污水管道发生的液压。
However, there is disagreement with the WHO on the origin of aerosols - the researchers found through experiments at HKU that aerosols are produced by the hydraulic pressure generated by vertical sewer lines during the operation of flush toilets.
此前，李兰娟曾表示，新冠病毒有没有通过血液传播、粪便传播、污染物品的传播，还需要进一步证实。
Before that, Li Lanjuan has said that the new crown virus is not through blood transmission, fecal transmission, pollution of the spread of the need for further confirmation.
2020年2月1日，深圳第三人民医院在某些新冠肺炎患者的粪便中检测出新冠病毒RNA阳性，这说明新型冠状病毒很可能通过粪口传播。
On February 1, 2020, Shenzhen's Third People's Hospital tested positive for RNA in the feces of some patients with Newly Coronavirus, suggesting that the new coronavirus is likely to spread through the feces.
不仅中国，美国在其第一例新型冠状病毒患者的排泄物中，同样发现病毒核酸检测结果显示阳性。
Not only China, but also the United States in its first case of coronavirus excretion, the virus nucleic acid test results found positive.
钟南山也曾透过媒体提醒，虽然现在新冠肺炎主要还是通过飞沫传染，但要注意粪便传染的可能性。
Zhong Nan Shan also warned through the media, although the new crown pneumonia is still mainly through the foam, but should pay attention to the possibility of fecal infection.
确实，现有的研究还无法推测排泄物中是否含有的是具有传染性的新冠病毒，因为粪便中失活病毒，也能在核酸检测中显示阳性结果。
Indeed, available studies have not been able to speculate whether excreta contain the infectious new crown virus, which is inactivated in faeces and can also show positive results in nucleic acid tests.
如果能在大便中分离到完整的病毒，并且培养成功，才可以100%的确定，粪便中是否具有传染性的病毒。
If you can isolate a complete virus in your stool and cultivate success, you can determine by 100% if the feces are infectious.
虽然对这一传播途径尚存疑，冯录召认为，这些现象提示我们要勤洗手，尤其是接触了容易污染的物体表面、饭前、便后等。
Although there are doubts about this route of transmission, Feng Luo-cheng believes that these phenomena suggest that we should wash hands frequently, especially contact with the surface of easily contaminated objects, before and after meals, etc.
