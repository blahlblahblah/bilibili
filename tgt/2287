澎湃新闻记者 贺梨萍新冠肺炎无症状感染者由于症状不明显或者几乎没有症状，很容易被忽视，这部分感染者也被认为是疫情防控的难点之一。
The asymptomatic infection of Ho Liping New Crown Pneumonia by Peng Pai journalist is easy to be ignored because the symptoms are not obvious or almost without symptoms.
2月26日，来自中国科学技术大学附属第一院（安徽省立医院）、安徽医科大学附属安庆医院、安徽省疾控中心等团队的研究人员在中国科学院科技论文预发布平台ChinaXiv提交了一项最新研究（未经同行评审），报告了一名新冠病毒无症状感染者的发现和临床治疗细节。
On February 26, researchers from the First Hospital (Anhui Provincial Hospital) attached to the Chinese University of Science and Technology, Anhui Anqing Hospital and Anhui Province CDC presented a recent study (without peer review) on the Chinese Academy of Sciences' pre-release platform for scientific papers, reporting details of the discovery and clinical treatment of an asymptomatic new crown virus.
该研究的通讯作者为中国科学技术大学生命科学和医学部教授翁建平、安徽医科大学附属安庆医院副院长刘建。
The study was written by Wang Jianping, professor of life sciences and medicine at China University of Science and Technology, and Liu Jian, vice-president of Anqing Hospital, Anhui Medical University.
论文中提到，据研究团队所了解，此次研究应该是新冠病毒无症状感染者的首次论文报告。
According to the team's understanding, the study should be the first paper on asymptomatic patients with the new crown virus, the paper said.
研究的这名对象为50岁女性，经核酸检测确诊为新冠病毒阳性至论文提交已20天，但截至论文提交该感染者核酸检测尚未转阴。
The subject, a 50-year-old woman, had been diagnosed as Nucleic Acid (Nucleic Acid) positive by 20 days before the paper was submitted, but the infected person's DNA test had not yet turned negative.
研究团队还根据临床治疗结果认为，目前的治疗对这名感染者可能无效，反而造成轻微的肝损伤。
The team also concluded, based on clinical treatment, that the current treatment may not be effective for the infected person and may have caused mild liver damage.
他们据此提出，对于无症状或症状轻微的患者，隔离和密切观察可能风险更小。
As a result, they suggest, isolation and close observation may be less risky for patients with asymptomatic or mild symptoms.
值得一提的是，中国工程院副院长、呼吸与危重症医学专家王辰在2月19日晚播出的《新闻1+1》节目中也回应了无症状感染者的问题，他表示，“对无症状感染者的判断主要是靠核酸检测，以后还会有抗原检测、抗体检测，这些检测方法是甄别无症状感染者有效的手段。
It is worth mentioning that Wang Chen, vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and a specialist in respiratory and critical medicine, also responded to the problem of asymptomatic infections in the evening of February 19.
”他同时提到，新冠病毒或许也会发生一定的变化，针对它所反映出来的生物学特点，“我们随着认识加深，会对应制订一些医学上的防范和诊断治疗方法，并做出相应的安排和预防。
He also said that the new crown virus might change somewhat, reflecting biological characteristics that "as we learn more, we should develop preventive and diagnostic treatments for the disease and plan and prevent it accordingly.
”密切监测是发现无症状患者的一种选择，但代价高昂2020年2月，研究团队在安徽医科大学附属安庆医院确诊了4名家庭聚集性的新冠肺炎患者。
Close monitoring is an option for finding asymptomatic patients, but the team confirmed four cases of familial pneumonia in February 2020 at Anqing Hospital, an affiliate of Anhui Medical University.
其中，家庭成员之一（YQ，患者A）为无症状患者。
One of the family members (YQ, patient A) was asymptomatic.
目前，为保证检测质量，安徽省实行两步确认策略，市级疾控中心和省级疾控中心分别确认后，患者最终被确诊为新冠肺炎。
At present, in order to ensure the quality of testing, Anhui Province to implement the two-step confirmation strategy, the city CDC and provincial CDC respectively confirmed that the patients were finally diagnosed as New Crown Pneumonia.
YQ为一名50岁女性，和她的丈夫（患者B）一起生活在安庆。
YQ is a 50-year-old woman who lives in Anqing with her husband (patient B).
夫妇二人均未到过武汉或武汉附近城市，二人也否认有过野生动物接触史。
Neither has visited Wuhan or a city near Wuhan, and the two have denied any history of contact with wild animals.
丈夫在1月23日-1月25日和他的姐姐（患者C）和姐夫（患者D）有过近距离接触。
The husband had close contact with his sister (patient C) and brother-in-law (patient D) from 23 January to 25 January.
患者C和患者D也没有武汉旅行史，但是患者D在1月21日的时候曾经和患者E一起工作过。
Patients C and D had no Wuhan travel history either, but patient D had worked with patient E on January 21.
在跟患者D见面之前，患者E从武汉回到安庆，后来他被确诊为新冠肺炎。
Before meeting patient D, patient E returned from Wuhan to Anqing, where he was later diagnosed with pneumonia.
流行病学信息患者D在1月26日开始发烧，患者C在1月30日开始发烧。
Epidemiological Information Patient D had a fever on January 26, and Patient C had a fever on January 30.
他们第一时间在安庆第二人民医院住院，并采集了咽拭子。
They were hospitalized at Anqing Second People's Hospital for the first time and collected swabs and swabs.
2月5日，这两例患者被确认为新冠病毒阳性。
On 5 February, both cases were confirmed to be positive for the new crown virus.
确诊之后，他们立即被转院到安徽医科大学附属安庆医院。
Immediately after the diagnosis, they were transferred to Anqing Hospital, an affiliate of Anhui Medical University.
作为密切接触者，YQ和患者B虽然没有包括发烧、咳嗽或呼吸方面的任何症状，他们也均在同一天接受了咽拭子检测和CT扫描。
As close contacts, YQ and patient B received swabs and CT scans the same day, although they did not include any symptoms of fever, cough, or breathing.
2月6日，YQ和患者B确诊为新冠肺炎阳性患者。
On February 6, YQ and patient B were diagnosed as New Crown Pneumonia-positive.
患者B胸部CT扫描显示右肺下段呈毛玻璃样阴影（GGO），提示病毒感染，YQ胸部CT扫描未见明显异常。
The CT scan of B chest showed that the lower part of the right lung was a carapace-like shadow (GGO), suggesting virus infection.
2月6日当天，YQ和患者B入住安徽医科大学附属安庆医院，接受治疗和观察。
On February 6, YQ and patient B were admitted to Anqing Hospital, an affiliate of Anhui Medical University, for treatment and observation.
YQ住院期间体温和血氧饱和度YQ无高血压、糖尿病、慢性肝病、慢性肾病等病史。
YQ had no history of hypertension, diabetes, chronic liver disease, chronic nephropathy, etc.
入院时生命体征正常，体温36.6℃，脉搏每分钟88次，呼吸频率每分钟20次，血压136/90mmHg，血氧饱和度（SpO2）99%。
Vital signs on admission were normal, body temperature 36.6 ° C, pulse rate 88 times per minute, respiration frequency 20 times per minute, blood pressure 136 / 90 mmHg, blood oxygen saturation (Spo2) 99%.
从1月23日开始，在住院期间，YQ没有报告发烧、疲劳、疼痛或任何胃肠道和呼吸道症状，包括咳嗽、喉咙痛、腹泻或呕吐。
From 23 January, while in hospital, YQ did not report fever, fatigue, pain or any gastrointestinal or respiratory symptoms, including cough, sore throat, diarrhoea or vomiting.
护士和医生也没有发现她有这些症状。
Neither the nurse nor the doctor found any of these symptoms.
研究团队在讨论环节指出，如果没有详细的流行病学询问和密切监控，很难发现YQ，甚至她丈夫也很难被发现，他除了咽拭子呈阳性和CT扫描肺有异常外，也没有其他症状。
During the discussion, the team noted that YQ was difficult to detect without detailed epidemiological inquiries and close surveillance, and that even her husband was difficult to detect, and that he had no symptoms other than swabs positive and abnormal CT scans of the lungs.
这对夫妇在被发现之前并没有意识到感染，并将病毒传染给了其他人。
The couple were unaware of the infection before it was discovered and passed the virus on to others.
因此，为防止疾病以这种方式传播，对无症状个体的密切监测将是一种选择，但代价高昂。
Therefore, close monitoring of asymptomatic individuals would be an option, but costly, to prevent the disease from spreading in this way.
当然，更好的解决办法可能是开发保护性疫苗。
Of course, a better solution might be to develop a protective vaccine.
核酸检测持续呈阳性，目前治疗可能无效住院之后的2月6日至2月16日期间，YQ接受了中医（TCM）、雾化干扰素α2β、洛匹那韦/利托那韦治疗。
Nucleic acid testing continued to be positive, and between 6 February and 16 February, after potentially ineffective hospitalization, YQ received TCM, Interferon Fogging 2, Lopinavir / Ritonavir.
随后她中断了中医和洛匹那韦/利托那韦，改静脉注射利巴韦林。
She then discontinued TCM and Lopinavir / Ritonavir and switched to intravenous ribavirin.
2月16日，她的实验室检测结果基本正常。
On February 16, her lab test results were almost normal.
2月20日，肝酶轻度升高，但她的感觉没有任何变化，也没有观察到体征或症状的变化。
Liver enzymes were slightly elevated on February 20, but her senses did not change and no changes in signs or symptoms were observed.
治疗中加入了肝保护剂甘草酸。
The liver protector glycyrrhizic acid was added to the treatment.
2月11日和2月20日还进行了胸部CT扫描，结果均为正常。
Chest CT scans were also performed on 11 February and 20 February, all of which were normal.
值得注意的是，2月19日，YQ的第二次咽拭子及其肛门拭子被送去检测，两份结果显示均为新冠病毒阳性。
Notably, on 19 February, YQ's second pharyngeal swab and his anal swab were tested, both of which were positive for the new crown virus.
作者们提到，截至提交这篇论文，YQ还在住院治疗。
The authors mention that, as of the submission of this paper, YQ is still hospitalized.
研究团队判断，按照目前的临床分析，YQ可能是一名健康无症状的病毒携带者。
The team determined that, based on current clinical analysis, YQ may be a healthy and asymptomatic carrier of the virus.
此外，尽管在两周的住院治疗期间，YQ接受了中医、洛匹那韦/利托那韦和利巴韦林治疗，但她的病毒核酸持续呈阳性表明，这些治疗可能无效。
In addition, although YQ received TCM, Lopinavir / Ritonavir and ribavirin treatment during her two-week hospitalization, her continued positive viral nucleic acid status suggests that these treatments may not be effective.
这在另一支团队的一项随机临床试验中也得到了证明。
This was also demonstrated in a randomized clinical trial by another team.
此前的2月21日，国家卫生健康委专家组成员、上海市公共卫生临床中心党委书记卢洪洲团队在《中华传染病杂志》发表了一项最新研究，他们回顾性分析了134例确诊新冠肺炎患者的临床资料后也得出，未发现洛匹那韦/利托那韦具有改善症状或缩短呼吸道标本病毒核酸转阴时间的作用，认为其有效性仍有待进一步临床研究确认。
Earlier on February 21, Lu Hongzhou, a member of the group of experts of the National Health and Health Commission and party secretary of the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre, published a new study in the Chinese Journal of Infectious Diseases. They also reviewed 134 confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia and concluded that Lopinavir / Ritonavir had no effect on improving symptoms or shortening the time of RNA conversion.
针对另一药物阿比多尔也是同样的结论。
The same conclusion was reached for another drug, Abidol.
此外，在对YQ的治疗中，治疗后观察到的肝酶升高可能是由于使用了洛吡那韦/利托那韦，肝损伤是其常见的副作用。
In addition, in the treatment of YQ, elevated liver enzymes observed after treatment may be due to the use of clopidovir / ritonavir, with liver damage being a common side effect.
研究团队最后提出，对于无症状或症状轻微的患者，隔离和密切观察可能风险更小。
The team concludes that isolation and close observation may be less risky for patients with asymptomatic or mild symptoms.
