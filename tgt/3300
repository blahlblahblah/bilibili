澎湃新闻记者 南博一3月9日，因抗议意大利政府的防疫措施，意大利多所监狱发生暴动事件。
A riot broke out in several Italian prisons on March 9 in protest against the Italian government's anti-epidemic measures.
暴动致使20名囚犯越狱，7名囚犯死亡。
The riot resulted in the escape of 20 prisoners and the death of 7.
据意大利安莎通讯社3月9日报道，9日上午，共有50名囚犯在骚乱中逃出意大利南部的福贾监狱，警方成功制止了其中30名囚犯越狱，另有20名在逃。
A total of 50 inmates escaped from Fordja prison in southern Italy during riots on the morning of Tuesday, police said, stopping the escape of 30 of them and leaving 20 others at large.
同时，首都罗马的两个监狱和普拉托省的一个监狱也因囚犯暴动而发生火灾。
Meanwhile, fires broke out in two prisons in the capital, Rome, and one in Prato province as a result of riots by prisoners.
目前意大利各地监狱暴动已造成7名囚犯死亡，其中有人死于精神药物服用过量，有人因火灾烟雾窒息死亡。
Rioting in prisons across Italy has killed seven prisoners, some from overdoses of psychotropic substances and others from asphyxiation due to smoke from fires.
另据美国《商业内幕》报道，由于8日意大利政府宣布该国北部开始封城，此前报道《意大利紧急“封城”》，监狱中的囚犯也感到受到限制，因为封城措施影响了囚犯家属的探视活动。
Insider business reported that on the 8th the Italian government announced the opening of the northern part of the country, following reports of an emergency "closure" of Italy, and that the prison population also felt restricted because of restrictions on visits by prisoners' families.
另外，由于监狱为密闭空间，囚犯们对新冠病毒感染感到恐慌，从而引发骚乱。
In addition, as the prison was closed, the inmates were frightened by the infection of the new crown virus, which caused riots.
据安莎通讯社报道，在米兰的圣维托雷监狱和罗马的雷比比亚监狱发生了严重的骚乱，囚犯们纵火焚烧了床垫，还袭击了医务室。
According to ANSA, serious disturbances occurred at San Vito Prison in Milan and at Rebibia Prison in Rome, where prisoners set fire to mattresses and attacked the infirmary.
最严重的暴动发生在米兰南部的帕维亚监狱，囚犯们破坏了监狱设施，在监狱管理人员与之进行了“漫长而艰难的谈判”过后，他们才被说服返回牢房。
The most serious rioting took place in Pavia prison, south of Milan, where prisoners damaged prison facilities and were persuaded to return to their cells only after "long and difficult negotiations" between prison staff and them.
意大利的监狱系统可容纳约51000名囚犯，但目前在服役囚犯已超过61000名，人员长期密集。
The Italian prison system can accommodate approximately 51,000 prisoners, but currently there are more than 61,000 prisoners in active service, with a long-term high density of personnel.
意大利司法部长阿方索·博纳菲德（Alfonso Bonafede）表示，他将在周三（11日）下午5时紧急向国会参议院介绍监狱暴动情况。
Alfonso Bonafede, Italy's justice minister, said he would urgently brief the Senate on prison riots at 5 p.m. Wednesday.
