点击上方物质生活参考加星标！物质生活参考作者：王路来源：物质生活参考（ID：wzshck）01.嘉楠的父母在北京度过了比预想中漫长得多的时间。
[dvnewspage] http: / / www.youtheme.cn1.Katherine's parents spent a much longer time in Beijing than they had expected.
因为意外的疫情，计划中的过年七天乐，变成了被迫滞留两个多月。
As a result of the unexpected outbreak, the planned New Year's Day joy, became forced to stay for more than two months.
超长无缝近距离共处率先逼疯的是父母，老家疫情稳定后，两人迫不及待地返家。
Ultra-long seamless close co-existence is the first to drive crazy parents, home after the epidemic stabilized, the two can not wait to return home.
嘉楠重新过上了自在的独居生活。
Kanon had regained her comfortable solitary life.
与从前稍有不同的是，除了照顾自己，她还要照顾老妈托付给她的宝贵资产：一盆小葱、一盆青蒜、一盆生菜，还有一盘豆芽。
In a slightly different way, besides taking care of herself, she had to take care of the precious assets entrusted to her by her mother: a pot of onions, a pot of green garlic, a pot of lettuce, and a plate of bean sprouts.
从前，嘉楠对父母在家种菜的行为敬谢不敏。
Once upon a time, Kanon was not sensitive to her parents' behavior in growing vegetables at home.
一个合乎理想的独居小家里，养的应该是精致的多肉或水培绿植，种菜似乎过于朴实无华。
An ideal single-family home, should be a delicate meat or hydroponic green, vegetable seems to be too simple.
但疫情发生后，形势立转。
But after the outbreak, the situation changed.
在买菜主要靠秒杀抢购的那几日，家中蓬勃生长的几盆菜，俨然成了嘉楠最后的心理防线：“从来没有这么深刻地认识到什么叫‘手中有粮，心里不慌’。
In the days when the buying of vegetables was based on a snap-up, several pots of vegetables that had flourished in the house had become Kanon's last line of defense: Never had there been such a deep sense of what is meant by 'food in the hand, not panic'.
”心境不同，花盆里的菜也越看越顺眼。
The mood was different, and the dishes in the pots looked better and better.
小葱和青蒜碧绿挺拔，颇具观赏性。
Green onions and garlic green straight, quite ornamental.
豆芽则是发育飞快，几天就见收成，比起工作中难缠的甲方和改不完的PPT，炒一盘自己种的菜，似乎更有成就感。
Bean sprout is rapid development, a few days to see the harvest, compared to the work of troublesome Party A and the endless PPT, stir-fry a dish of their own, seems more sense of accomplishment.
对于成长于城市的年轻人来说，种菜已经是个陌生的技能。
Growing vegetables is a strange skill for young people growing up in cities.
而疫情意外地让我们重新点亮了这个源远流长的非物质文化遗产级种族天赋。
And the epidemic has unexpectedly rekindled this long-standing Intangible Cultural Heritage-level racial talent.
在春节过后外卖和快递不甚顺畅的那些日子里，会做饭一度成为最新时髦技能，朋友圈被凉皮和蛋糕霸屏。
In those days when take-out and express delivery were slow, cooking was once the latest fad, with friends clad in sandals and cakes.
在这条非常时期的鄙视链上，唯一能秒杀做饭的，大概就是种菜。
In this very period of scorn chain, the only second to cook, is probably planting vegetables.
据说疫情像一面镜子，毫不留情地暴露出每个国家最脆弱的环节；被迫居家则创造了难得的外部条件，各民族的种族天赋和特质得以展露无遗。
The epidemic is said to be a mirror, revealing relentlessly the most vulnerable links in every country; forced homes create unique externalities in which the racial talents and characteristics of peoples are revealed.
意大利人在阳台上唱歌剧、拉小提琴，充分展现了艺术国度的风范；而我国人民除了化身中华小当家，还热衷于争当阳台陶渊明：唱歌不大行，做饭种菜第一名。
Italians on the balcony singing opera, playing the violin, fully displayed the artistic style of the country; and our people, in addition to incarnate Chinese small masters, are also keen to become balcony Tao Yuanming: singing very little, cooking vegetables first.
父母辈首先发挥优势，利用手头一切资源积极种菜。
Parents develop their advantages first, using all available resources to actively plant vegetables.
青蒜小葱信手拈来，生菜韭菜不在话下，经验较为丰富的长辈，已经吃上了自己种的西红柿。
Green garlic spring onions handy, lettuce and leeks can be said, more experience of the elders, has eaten their own tomatoes.
年轻人种菜更依赖网络。
Young people rely more on the Internet to grow vegetables.
花盆、种子、发豆芽机开始热销，种菜教程播放量猛增。
Flower pot, seed, hair bean sprout machine began to sell hot, the number of tutorial broadcast surged.
有些雄心勃勃的选手，在成功收割第一波青蒜之后膨胀不已，开始摩拳擦掌，研究阳台小菜园的可行性。
Ambitious players, inflated after harvesting the first wave of garlic, began to mop up and study the feasibility of a balcony garden.
大概可以大胆断言：中国人种菜的传统和种族天赋，肯定不会在这届年轻人手里中断。
It is probably safe to assert that the traditional and ethnic genius of the Chinese people to grow vegetables will not be interrupted by this generation of young people.
02.在家种菜爱好者们喜欢自称“阳台陶渊明”。
Vegetable lovers at home love to call themselves "balcony Tao Yuanming."
听上去十分文艺，但仔细推敲，不免为他们的种菜生涯感到担忧。
It sounds very literary, but on closer inspection, they are worried about their vegetable career.
毕竟，从陶渊明诗中的描述看，他的菜种得并不怎么样。
After all, the description in Tao Yuanming's poems shows that his dishes are not very good.
一年多前，华中师大教授戴建业的语录在网上爆红，其中流传最广的，是他对陶渊明那句“种豆南山下，草盛豆苗稀”的犀利吐槽：“第一句那么隆重，你以为他种得蛮好，结果‘草盛豆苗稀’，种的个鬼田。
More than a year ago, Dai Jianye, a professor at Central China Normal University, made a hit online, the most popular of which was his sharp spit on Tao Yuanming's sentence, "Soybean plants grow sparsely under Nanshan Mountain."
”戴教授精研魏晋六朝诗歌，著有研究陶渊明的专著，属于陶渊明铁粉，如此吐槽实乃欲扬先抑，粉到浓时粉似黑。
Professor Dai concentrated on the poems of the Wei and Jin dynasties and wrote a monograph on Tao Yuanming, which belongs to Tao Yuanming Iron Powder.
但对于广大“阳台陶渊明”来说，“种豆南山下，草盛豆苗稀”是真实扎心。
But for the vast "balcony Tao Yuanming", "sown beans under the South Hill, grass Sheng bean seedlings thin" is true piercing heart.
“种豆南山下”抒发了我们对种菜和田园生活的情结，而“草盛豆苗稀”则犀利地指出了“阳台陶渊明”们面对的残酷现实：菜么得几颗，杂草和蚊虫倒是收获了不少。
"Soybean Nanshan below" expresses our love affair about planting vegetables and pastoral life, while "thin grass seedlings" pointed out the harsh reality faced by "balcony Yuanming": a few dishes, weeds and mosquitoes have gained a lot.
青蒜豆芽这种水培即可茁壮成长的蔬菜，几乎和绿萝一样好养。
Green garlic bean sprouts this kind of water can thrive on vegetables, almost as good as the green pineapple.
但如果有更高的追求，难免就要遭受种种意想不到的挫折。
But if there is a higher pursuit, will inevitably suffer a variety of unexpected setbacks.
新手选种就是一大坑。
A beginner's seed is a hole.
当年流行买种子种花时，多少人都曾经体验过种了仨月才发现货不对板的惨痛。
When buying seeds and planting flowers, how many people have experienced a full month before the discovery of the wrong goods miserable.
目前，在家种菜的市场规模尚不大，种菜博主们通常会推荐找淘宝上提供分装的商家。
At present, the market for home-grown vegetables is still small, vegetable bloggers will usually recommend looking for sub-packers on Taobao.
常年四体不勤的都市人，也很难搞清土和肥料如何搭配。
Urban dwellers, who are often hard-pressed, also have trouble figuring out how to mix soil and manure.
B站一位种植UP主就曾有如此遭遇：兴高采烈地种下西红柿，结果因为钙质不足，头两批收获的都是这样的果实[1]。
A UP farmer once had such an experience: Growing tomatoes in high spirits and not having enough calcium, the first two lots with such fruit and # 91; 1 & # 93; & # 93;
种菜的过程也可能会饱受惊吓。
The process of growing vegetables can also be spooked.
“欢言酌春酒，摘我园中蔬”的理想很美好，但在现实中，白菜叶招虫子、红薯叶招蜘蛛，足以让所有怕虫子的人魂飞天外。
The ideal of "drinking wine with wine and picking vegetables from my garden" is very good, but in reality, Chinese cabbage leaves attract insects and sweet potatoes to attract spiders, which is enough to send all bugs-fearing people out of their wits.
没种过菜的人，很少会意识到种菜需要消耗多少水。
People who have never grown a vegetable seldom realize how much water it takes to grow it.
你或许出得起水费，但住在楼房，排水是大问题。
You may be able to afford water, but living in a building and draining is a big problem.
解决方案要么是花钱配套滴灌设备，要么是做好阳台防水、铺好隔水垫和防水布。
The solution is either to spend money on drip irrigation equipment, or to do a good job of waterproofing balconies, waterproof mats and tarpaulins.
总之，现阶段能在阳台上花式种菜的人，除了有坚定的意志，还要有坚韧的精神、超乎寻常的耐心和屡败屡战的勇气，以及天时地利人和。
In short, at this stage can be on the balcony fancy vegetables, in addition to a firm will, but also have tenacity, extraordinary patience and repeatedly defeated courage, as well as the time and space.
在国外，最广为人知的阳台种菜法，来自美国退休土木工程师梅尔•巴塞罗缪。
Abroad, the most well-known method of balcony gardening comes from retired American civil engineer Mel Baceromew.
他在1975年退休后才开始园艺生涯，起初和所有人一样，满腔热情和期盼换来满园疯长的杂草。
He began his gardening career in 1975, when he retired, and at first, like everyone else, swarmed with enthusiasm and anticipation for overgrown weeds.
不过，失败之后，他没有放弃，而是开始反思传统园艺种植的不合理之处[2]。
But, instead of giving up, he has begun to rethink the irrationality of traditional horticultural farming. & # 91; 2 & # 93;
巴塞罗缪认为，过于粗放的种植方式导致菜园的养料都被杂草吸收。
Bartholomew believes that over-extensive planting has led to a garden being sucked up by weeds.
经过反复试验，他提出了自己的解决方案：设计出一种1.2米×1.2米的种植箱，充分利用小空间种植蔬菜。
After trial and error, he came up with his own solution: design a 1.2m x 1.2m planting box that makes full use of small spaces for growing vegetables.
按照这套他发明的“一米菜园”种植法，种植箱通常被等分为16个小格子。
Under his invention of a "one-meter vegetable garden," planting boxes are often divided into 16 cells.
卷心菜、花椰菜、西红柿、茄子等可以每格种1棵；生菜、油麦菜等可以每格种4棵，洋葱、菠菜等可以每格种9棵，芝麻菜、香菜等可以每格种16棵。
Cabbage, broccoli, tomato, eggplant, etc. can be planted 1 per lattice; lettuce, rapeseed, etc. 4 plants per frame, onion, spinach, etc. 9 plants per case, sesame seeds, parsley, etc. 16 plants per case.
其中要注意，同一个格子里不能种2种以上相同科属的蔬菜，因为品性接近的蔬菜容易滋生同类病害[3]。
Note that not more than two vegetables of the same family can be grown in the same compartment, as vegetables of similar quality tend to breed similar diseases and diseases; 3 & # 93;
“一米菜园”适合新手快速上手，不需要花费太多时间打理，而且颜值超高，看上去赏心悦目。
The "one meter vegetable garden" is suitable for beginners to get to work quickly, without spending much time in care, and with a high face value that looks pleasing to the eye.
但它的缺点也很明显：空间太小、土壤太浅、浇水需求大，并非适用于所有人[4]。
But its drawbacks are also obvious: Too little space, too shallow soil, and a heavy need for watering. Not at all & # 91; 4 & # 93; & # 93;
阳台种菜，道阻且长。
Terrace planting vegetables, road block and long.
不过，我们至少可以学习陶渊明的精神，即便“草盛豆苗稀”也没关系，重要的是，“但使愿无违”。
However, we can at least learn from the spirit of Tao Yuanming, even if "grass seedling thin" is not relevant, but the important thing is, "but not against."
03.中国人可能多少都有一点乡土田园情结。
Chinese people may have a bit of a rustic complex.
至少，种菜算得上是中国历史中一项悠久而光荣的传统。
At least, growing vegetables is a long and glorious tradition in Chinese history.
经典红歌《南泥湾》，唱的是八路军三五九旅开垦荒地，“又战斗来又生产”的故事。
The classic red song, "Nan Mud Bay," tells the story of the Eighth Route Army clearing wasteland "fighting and producing again."
而军队屯田种粮种菜的历史可以向前追溯到两千年多前，《居延汉简》有“韭三畦，葱三畦，葵七畦”的记载，足见早在汉代，边疆军队就开始种菜。
The history of farming and growing vegetables in the army can be traced back to more than two thousand years ago. "Jian Han Jian" has a record of "leek beds, spring onions three beds, Kwai Qi beds."
种菜还无意中解决了许多难题。
Growing vegetables has also unwittingly solved many difficult problems.
据随同郑和下西洋的马欢在《瀛涯胜览》中记载，当时的船员在木盆里种植蔬菜、生姜[5]，据说郑和船队中之所以没有发生大大规模坏血病，就是因为有蔬菜保障。
According to Ma Huan, who accompanied Zheng He in the Western Ocean, at the time the crew grew vegetables, ginger and # 91 in wooden pots. It is said that Zheng He didn't have massive scurvy because of the guarantee of vegetables.
当代中国人则在世界各个角落创造种菜传奇。
Contemporary Chinese have created vegetable legends in every corner of the world.
大使馆、维和部队把菜种到了海外↓浙商把菜种到了迪拜沙漠↓随队医生把菜种到了南极科考站↓至于中国陪读家长在耶鲁种菜，属于基本操作，无须大惊小怪。
The embassy and the peacekeeping force had sent their vegetables overseas to Dell Computers in the Dubai Desert. The doctor had planted the vegetables in the South Pole Station. As for Chinese parents planting vegetables at Yale, it was a basic operation.
对种菜的热爱，有十分实际的理由。
There is a very practical reason for a love of growing vegetables.
历史上，中国有数千次饥荒，直到我们上一辈人，仍然有吃不饱饭的记忆。
Historically, there have been thousands of famines in China, and until the last generation we had the memory of not having enough to eat.
见缝插针地种菜、节约，于很多人来说，是曾经的艰辛生活留下的本能。
Sewing vegetables, saving, for many people, was the hard life left by the instinct.
但除此之外，我们也是真的喜欢和种菜有关的一切。
But beyond that, we really like everything to do with growing vegetables.
即便当代年轻人已经少有亲手种菜的机会，但十多年前互联网兴起时，最流行的游戏是“偷菜”；如今视频自媒体兴起，大家看得如醉如痴的，也是回乡种菜的李子柒、花式吃鼠的华农兄弟。
Even though young people nowadays rarely have the chance to grow vegetables themselves, the most popular game in the rise of the Internet more than a decade ago was "stealing vegetables"; now video has sprung up in the media and is widely seen as intoxicated as the Chinese brothers returning to the countryside to paint vegetables and fancy rat-eating brothers.
这大概是因为，每一株蔬菜长大，就是在见证生命的苏醒和生长。
This is probably because each vegetable grows up to witness the awakening and growth of life.
这本身已经足够令人欣慰和愉悦。
That in itself is comforting and pleasurable.
种它、养它、吃它。
Plant it, keep it, eat it.
这应该就是我们对一棵菜最大的尊敬。
This should be our greatest respect for a dish.
