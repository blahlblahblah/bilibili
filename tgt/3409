这一家四口中的那位60多岁的男性为该市场曾经的管理人员顾刚生平时商户们叫他“老顾”华南海鲜市场于2020年1月1日被封闭。
The 60-year-old man in the family was called "Old Gui" by merchants when Gu Gang, a former manager in the market, was closed on January 1, 2020.
（本刊记者/彭丹妮 摄）3月3日，武汉警方、疾控等部门工作人员在进入华南海鲜市场进行新一轮病毒消杀过程中，发现有一家四口在疫情期间一直居住在该市场内。
Wuhan police, disease control and other departments entered the South China seafood market on March 3 to conduct a new round of virus elimination, found a family of four people who had been living in the market during the outbreak.
据湖北卫视报道，这一家四口是“一对夫妻带着老人和孩子”，他们住在该海鲜市场内长达43天，没有采取防护措施，检测后发现并未被感染。
The family of four -- a couple with children and elderly people -- stayed at the seafood market for 43 days without taking precautions and tested positive for infection, Hubei TV reported.
这一家的经历被曝出后，引起高度关注。
The story of the family came to the fore.
在华南海鲜市场从事经营活动的多家商户对《中国新闻周刊》证实，这一家四口中的那位60多岁的男性为该市场曾经的管理人员顾刚生，平时商户们叫他“老顾”。
The 60-year-old man in the family has become a regular customer for Gu Gangsheng, a former manager in the South China Seafood Market, confirmed to China News Weekly.
他家在疫情期间居住的宿舍，位于华南海鲜市场东区二楼。
The dormitory where his family lived during the outbreak was located on the second floor of the eastern floor of the South China Seafood Market.
3月14日下午，《中国新闻周刊》通过电话与顾刚生取得联系，他证实自己确实是此前新闻中所提及的居住在华南海鲜市场的那一家四口中的一员。
On the afternoon of March 14, China News contacted Gu by telephone and confirmed that he was one of four people in the South China seafood market mentioned in the previous news report.
除他之外，“其余三人为我的干儿子，干儿媳和干孙子。
The other three were my adopted son, my daughter-in-law, and my great-grandson.
”华南海鲜市场“杨智辉大闸蟹”的经营者称，3月3日新一轮病毒消杀之后，市场内商户纷纷担心自己店铺的财产安全情况，很多人在市场的微信群里向顾刚生咨询有关情况。
The operators of the South China seafood market, Yang Zhihui Crab, said merchants were worried about the safety of their stores after a new wave of virus killing on March 3.
几天后，顾刚生在微信群中回复大家说，“市场现在清理了，我也出来了。
A few days later, Gu Gangsheng replied in a microphone group, "The market is cleared now and I'm out."
”在华南海鲜市场被指是新冠病毒感染发源地之后，留下的管理人员有5人，其中4人白天在市场办公室值班，晚上下班回家，而顾刚生因长年居住在华南海鲜市场的宿舍，所以基本上24小时都在市场内，在疫情正式暴发后，也一直居住在此，直到3月3日被发现。
After the South China seafood market was blamed for the outbreak, five managers remained, four of whom worked in market offices during the day and came home from work at night, while Gu was essentially in the market for his long years in the South China seafood market, where he stayed until March 3 after the outbreak.
华南海鲜市场在1月1日被查封之后，“杨智辉大闸蟹”的经营者曾见过顾刚生三次。
After the closure of the South China seafood market on January 1, operators of the Yang Zhihui hairy crab have seen Gu Gu three times.
第一次是1月1日市场被查封的当天下午，他见到顾刚生在解答商户问题，记得顾刚生说，“情况搞清楚了市场会开的。
The first time was on the afternoon of January 1, when the market was closed, he saw Gu Gangsheng answering merchant questions.
”另外两次见面均发生在武汉封城前，他去询问市场恢复营业的时间，当时顾刚生正在现场安抚商户情绪。
The other two meetings took place in front of Wuhan Fengcheng, where Gu Gangsheng was there to reassure traders when he asked when the market was reopening.
据这位经营者回忆，他与顾刚生相识于2002年华南海鲜市场刚成立时。
He and Mr. Gu met at the start of the South China seafood market in 2002, the operator recalls.
公开资料显示，华南海鲜市场的正式成立时间为2005年。
The official launch of the South China Seafood Market was in 2005, according to public sources.
但在媒体报道中，其实这家海鲜市场从1990年代末就已经存在，只是在2005年才注册成立管理公司。
But according to media reports, the seafood market has existed since the late 1990s, and it was only registered as a management company in 2005.
那时，顾刚生担任华南海鲜市场副总经理。
At that time, Gu Gangsheng was vice-president of South China Seafood Market.
后来他到了退休年龄，市场内的商户便不清楚顾的具体职务，只知道他依然参与市场管理，负责收租、检查卫生、协调纠纷等事宜。
By the time he reached retirement age, merchants in the market were unaware of his specific duties, except that he was still involved in market management, collecting rents, inspecting hygiene, coordinating disputes, etc.
据反映，顾刚生是在2012年左右开始在华南海鲜市场宿舍长住的。
It is reported that Gu Gangsheng began to live in the South China Seafood Market Dormitory around 2012.
之前他住在该市场附近的城中村站北新村。
He used to live near the market in the north village of Shengzhongcun station.
站北新村拆迁后，他才搬至市场内的宿舍。
After the demolition of the new village in the north, he moved to the market quarters.
据上游新闻采访知情人士称，顾某的干儿子是市场内卖米的商户。
According to the upstream news interviews with people familiar with the matter, Gu Mou's dry son is the market selling rice merchants.
此外，该知情人士称，顾某与妻子关系不好，儿子已去世。
In addition, the person said that Gu and his wife bad relationship, the son has died.
对于有关他个人家庭情况的各种传闻，顾刚生在接受《中国新闻周刊》采访时说，“每一家有每一家难念的经，私人的事情希望不要听信传言。
"Every family has its own stories to read," Gu told China News Weekly. "Every family has its own stories.
”至于更细节的情况，他拒绝进一步谈及。
For more details, he declined to comment further.
公开资料显示，华南海鲜市场建筑面积约5万平方米，经营户1000余户，是华中地区最大的海鲜批发市场。
Open data show that the South China seafood market, with a floor area of about 50,000 square meters and more than 1,000 households, is the largest wholesale seafood market in central China.
作为海鲜市场的管理人员，顾刚生为何长居市场宿舍中？市场管理人员的收入或许并非如外界想象的那样丰厚。
As manager of the seafood market, why does Gu live in a market dorm? Market managers may not make as much money as they think.
红星新闻采访市场内谭姓商户称，顾某平时月收入4000～5000元，扣除社保后，大部分工资都用在生活花销中。
Red Star News interview market Tan Shang said, Gu Mou peacetime income of 4000 ~ 5000 yuan, after deduction of social security, most of the wages are spent on living expenses.
湖北卫视3月3日在报道有关消息时称，这一家四口已送至武汉的一家酒店进行隔离。
Hubei satellite TV reported on March 3, said that the family has been sent to a hotel in Wuhan for isolation.
