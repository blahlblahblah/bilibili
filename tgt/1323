新冠疫情之下，一些 “神” 操作格外醒目。
Under the new crown epidemic, some "god" operation is particularly striking.
大理截获重庆口罩，青岛沈阳互扣口罩；个别地区排挤湖北人、歧视武汉人；村子在挖路断交，小区禁止租户返回，无锡劝返外地人；四川专家误读“粪口传播”，中科院研究员带货双黄连，湖北官员戴反口罩，武汉院士判错病毒类型，上海民政官员判断“气溶胶传播”。
Some localities exclude Hubei people and discriminate against Wuhan; villagers are digging up roads and severing diplomatic ties, and tenants are forbidden to return to Wuxi. Experts in Sichuan misread "fecal communication" and Chinese Academy of Sciences researcher Shuang Huanglian, Hubei officials wear anti-masks, Wuhan academicians misjudge "aerosol transmission."
诸如此类举不胜举。
That is all too numerous.
用专业术语讲，各个层级在公共卫生应对紧急疫情的短板再次显现，风险沟通、社区应对以及政府管理出现失误。
In professional terms, the gaps in public health response to emergencies at all levels have re-emerged, with failures in risk communication, community response, and government management.
世界卫生组织指出，风险沟通和社区应对新冠病毒疫情不可或缺，称这是自 21 世纪包括 SARS 疫情、MERS 疫情、甲型 H1N1 流感疫情和埃博拉疫情等一系列事件中吸取的主要教训之一。
The World Health Organization (WHO) noted that risk communication and community response to the new crown virus epidemic were essential, citing this as one of the key lessons learned from the series of events of the twenty-first century, including the SARS epidemic, the MERS epidemic, the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic and the Ebola outbreak.

（来源：中国疾控中心）有多年美国疾控中心工作经验的佐治亚大学公共卫生学院副教授陈茁指出，武汉机动车限行和 “封城” 的决策可能换取全国 14 亿人口的相对安全，但因其复杂性，也会对市民生活和经济活动有不可忽视的影响。
(Source: China CDC) Chen Zhuo, associate professor at the University of Georgia School of Public Health, who has years of experience with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Wuhan motor vehicle restrictions and city closures could offer relative safety for the nation's 1.4 billion people, but their complexity could have a significant impact on citizens' lives and economic activities.
如果能预先进行兵棋推演，预估各个方案方方面面的执行成本，就可以最小化疫情的影响。
The impact of the epidemic can be minimized if a game of chess can be conducted in advance to estimate the implementation costs of each option.
他同时是宁波诺丁汉大学经济学院李达三健康经济学首席教授。
He is also the chief professor of health economics at Li Da-san, School of Economics, Ningbo Nottingham University.
专业机构在应急决策和执行中应扮演更重要的角色。
Professional bodies should play a more important role in emergency decision-making and implementation.
陈茁表示，这是因为专业机构人员对科学信息有充分了解，对新的信息和其中隐含的危险也更敏感。
This, says Mr Chen, is because professionals are well informed about scientific information and more sensitive to new information and the dangers it implies.
在美国，卫生部长有权按公共卫生服务法案第 319 节认定重大传染病的爆发，美疾控中心主任也依法有权拘留、隔离和释放有州际间传播传染病风险的个人。
In the United States, the Secretary of Health has authority under section 319 of the Public Health Services Act to identify outbreaks of major infectious diseases, and the Director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is legally empowered to detain, isolate and release individuals at risk of interstate transmission of infectious diseases.
中国必须从法理上解决紧急情况下专业部门的权力和责任。
China must legally address the powers and responsibilities of its professional departments in emergency situations.
包括医疗战略物资的储备和调度上，他认为战略储备或许可以发挥重要的作用，管理科学也可以应用在战略物资储备的管理和调度上，为满足疫区医疗机构的需求及时服务。
He believes that strategic stocks may play an important role in the storage and deployment of strategic medical materials, and that management science can also be applied to the management and deployment of strategic stocks to meet the needs of medical institutions in epidemic areas.
另外，对于公共卫生人员的储备问题，他提出，美国的做法或许可以提供一个思路。
Also, on the issue of stocks of public health personnel, he suggested that the United States approach might provide a way forward.
美国卫生部下属一支共约六千余人的公共健康服务部队，他们不装备武器，主要为医生、护士等与公共健康相关的专业人员。
The United States Department of Health has a public health service of about 6,000 people who are unarmed and work primarily as public health professionals such as doctors and nurses.
他们平时在美疾控中心、国立卫生研究院、环保署、农业部等机构工作，紧急情况时会集结派驻到受影响地区来从事检疫、疾病防控以及救治工作。
They usually work at CDC, NIH, EPA, and the Department of Agriculture, and in emergencies, they gather in affected areas for quarantine, disease control, and treatment.
这样的人员组织方式便于在紧急情况时召集力量，半军事化的人事管理也有利于应急指挥。
Such personnel organization facilitates the convening power in times of emergency, and semi-militarized personnel management also facilitates emergency command.
专访陈茁：新发疫情下，如何作出专业决策（来源：美国疾控中心）DeepTech：国内对于新发疫情的应对显得有些慌乱，如何看待某些举措涉嫌歧视武汉人或湖北人？如何化解这个冲突？陈茁：我非常不认同歧视武汉人或者湖北人的做法。
(Source: CDC) DeepTech: China's response to the new outbreak appeared confused. What about some measures that might discriminate against Wuhan people or Hubei people?
病毒不认省籍，不认国籍。
The virus does not recognize provincial nationality, not nationality.
己所不欲，勿施于人。
Do unto others what you would not.
如果每个人都不希望自己患病时被歧视，那么先从自己做起，善待他人。
If everyone doesn't want to be discriminated against in the event of illness, start with yourself and be kind to others.
当然，必要的卫生措施可以有。
Of course, the necessary sanitary measures can be taken.
从根本上化解这个冲突恐怕需要长期人文素质的提高。
To resolve this conflict fundamentally will require the improvement of long-term humanistic quality.
短期内地方政府或许可以疏导。
Local governments may be able to channel this in the short term.
从目前了解到的信息来看，浙江等地的做法还是不错的，一方面加强防控措施，另一方面也善待处于隔离期的湖北人。
From the information obtained so far, Zhejiang and other places are still good practices, on the one hand, strengthen prevention and control measures, on the other hand, also treat people in isolation in Hubei.
境外也有中国人遭到歧视的个案发生，甚至有报纸用了 “中国病毒” 的说法。
There have also been cases of Chinese people being discriminated against abroad, and some newspapers have even used the term "Chinese virus."
我想可能还是要提高人文素质。
I think maybe we should improve the quality of humanities.
另外，这次疫情确实也有很多未知数，公众出现一些不理性的行为也不难理解。
In addition, the epidemic does have a lot of unknowns, and it is not hard to understand some of the irrational behavior of the public.
媒体，不管是传统纸媒和电子媒体如果能加以疏导，或许会有缓解。
The media, both traditional and electronic, may be relieved if they are channeled.
DeepTech：国内还发生了云南大理官方抢重庆运输的口罩，以及青岛和沈阳相互拦截防疫用品的新闻。
DeepTech: There have also been official looting of Chongqing masks in Yunnan, as well as news that Qingdao and Shenyang have interdicted epidemic prevention supplies.
这里有两个问题：其一，在 WHO 的建议中，一般情况下，没有呼吸道症状的个人出门是不需要医用口罩的。
There are two problems: First, in the WHO's recommendation, individuals without respiratory symptoms do not normally need a medical mask when going out.
国内对于口罩问题是不是过度反应了？其二，地方政府的应急管理有待规范，这正是你提到的管理科学问题，那么地方政府之间以及中央与地方的协调应该是怎样的一种关系，有哪些可借鉴的经验？陈茁：对于口罩问题，目前新冠肺炎的传播模式确实还是有些不清楚的地方，所以大家反应有些不太理性。
Second, the emergency management of local governments has yet to be regulated, which is exactly what kind of relationship between local governments and between central and local governments and what lessons can be learned from them.Chen: There is still some confusion about the mode of transmission of the new crown pneumonia, so the response is not rational.
我是赞同 WHO 建议的，另外在口罩缺乏的情况下，从社会的角度来说，优先给医护人员使用更好一些。
I agree with the World Health Organization's recommendation that, from a social standpoint, it is better to give priority to medical staff in the event of a lack of masks.
对于第二个问题，应急管理是门成长中的科学，其他国家可能也是在摸索着前进。
As for the second question, emergency management is a growing science, and other countries may be groping along.
美国在 2001 年之后成立了国土安全部，其中的应急管理署统筹全国的应急预案规划。
After 2001, the United States created the Department of Homeland Security, whose Emergency Management Agency coordinated national contingency planning.
但是在流行病疫情的应急中，一般还是卫生部和美国疾控中心来主导。
But the Department of Health and the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention typically lead the response to an epidemic.
我提到的管理科学可能更适用于物资和人员的调配方面。
The management science I have mentioned may be more applicable to the deployment of materials and personnel.
比如美国疾控中心会用运筹学来做一些疫苗在不同州之间和不同优先级人群中的发放管理等等。
The CDC, for example, uses operational research to make vaccine delivery management between states and among different priority populations.
美国的做法一般是，如果紧急事件是在州内，由州政府决定是否向联邦政府求援。
The general practice in the United States is that if an emergency is within a state, it is for the state to decide whether to ask the federal government for help.
但是如果涉及多州或者可能波及多州的事件，一般联邦政府介入主导。
However, in the case of a multi-State or potentially multi-State event, the general federal Government is involved.
当然，中美两国体制不同，解决的方式也会有不同。
Of course, China and the United States have different systems and different ways of solving them.
一个重要的地方是有预案。
One important thing is to have a plan.
没有预案，很多时候好的举措会慢一拍，像新冠肺炎这样的疫情就会错过干预的最好时机。
Without a plan, many good actions slow down, and an outbreak like Newcrown Pneumonia misses the best time to intervene.
DeepTech：世卫组织给出的建议包括，要确保不同部门和级别的信息保持一致。
DeepTech: WHO recommendations include ensuring consistency of information across sectors and levels.
这一条在当下做的是不够的。
What this article does now is not enough.
比如四川某位卫生部门管理者在解释 “粪口传播” 时理解为等同于吃屎，还有专家拿双黄连细胞试验的数据来误导公众。
For example, a health-care official in Sichuan interpreted "fecal transmission" as tantamount to eating excrement, and experts misled the public with data from the Shuanghuang cell test.
你认为如何确保信息一致？中国这么大而复杂的体系下，应该如何有序推进信息一致？陈茁：在发布信息成本大幅度降低的现代社会，确保信息一致很难。
In a system as large and complex as China's, how should information consistency be promoted in an orderly mannerChen: In a modern society where the cost of publishing information is drastically reduced, it is difficult to ensure uniformity of information.
一个办法是指定权威的专业机构来发布信息。
One way would be to designate authoritative professional bodies to publish information.
另外，信息的发布需要强调在大众中的传播，在专业术语、可操作性等方面要考虑到大众的需求。
In addition, the dissemination of information needs to emphasize the dissemination among the public, in terms of professional terminology, operability and other aspects to take into account the needs of the public.
及时和准确的发布才能赢得大众信任。
Prompt and accurate distribution wins the public's trust.
DeepTech：你提到一些方案如封城需要预先进行兵棋推演，那么如果做这些推演，需要哪些专家参与进来，应该走怎样的流程？陈茁：这些推演（simulation）一般有相应的专业人士和相关的机构一起来协作。
DeepTech: You mentioned that some projects, such as blocking cities, require advanced chess maneuvers, and if so, which experts should be involved and what process should be followed?
卫生政策与管理学科的一个功能就是做对各种干预手段的评估。
One of the functions of the discipline of health policy and management is to evaluate interventions.
评估的过程需要多学科多部门的参与，也是一个闭环，有着反馈，改善，再反馈的过程。
The assessment process requires multidisciplinary and multisectoral engagement and is a closed-loop process with feedback, improvement and feedback.
DeepTech：疫情应急中有一些做法不专业。
DeepTech: Some of the emergency response practices are unprofessional.
比如湖北省官员对口罩供给没有概念，他们戴口罩不专业，这似乎距离成熟的管理体系有很大距离。
Officials in Hubei province, for example, have no idea about the supply of face masks, which seems to be a long way from a mature management system.
你也提到，专业机构在应急决策和执行中应扮演更重要的角色。
You also mentioned that professional bodies should play a more important role in emergency decision-making and implementation.
在中国现实环境下，有什么切实可行的建议？陈茁：我的建议是从立法上解决这个问题。
What practical suggestions did you have under the realistic circumstance of ChinaB: My suggestion was to solve this problem through legislation.
专业机构的角色应该厘清并且以法律形式确认。
The role of professional bodies should be clarified and recognized in legal form.
具体的建议恐怕一下子很难给出来。
I'm afraid it's hard to come up with concrete proposals at once.
如果一定要说的话，我觉得要把中国应急的预案细化，而且在全国的省级单位要推广，加强认知。
If I have to say, I think China's emergency plan to be detailed, but also in provincial units throughout the country to promote, strengthen awareness.
当然不同地方紧急事件也会有不同，也应该在一个框架上加上适合地方需求的细节。
Of course, emergencies can vary from place to place, and details tailored to local needs should be added to a framework.
比如，地震多发地带和沿海台风多发省份的应急需求和细节会不一样。
For example, emergency needs and details will vary between earthquake-prone and coastal-typhoon-prone provinces.
DeepTech：目前看国内公共卫生的这种声音是很比较弱的，你觉得是公共卫生人才太少了，还是说我们对公共卫生不够重视？陈茁：其实全世界都有这个问题，美国也有这个问题。
If you think there are too few public health professionals, or if we don't pay enough attention to public health, you will have a problem with the whole world, and the United States will have the same problem.
美国奥巴马主政期间对公共卫生比较重视，通过了预防与公共卫生基金，每年大概有一个几十亿美元的预算。
During Obama's administration, public health was given greater prominence, with the adoption of the Prevention and Public Health Fund, which has a budget of approximately $1 billion a year.
但是在有埃博拉疫情和寨卡疫情的时候，人们会想起来疾控中心，没有疫情的时候就忘掉疾控中心了。
But when it comes to the Ebola epidemic and the Zika epidemic, people think of the CDC and forget about the CDC when there is no outbreak.
还有一个原因，美国现在反智的情形可能要比中国严重，比如反堕胎观念的流行和反疫苗观点的传播。
Another reason is that the US may now be more anti-intellectual than China, for example, because of the prevalence of anti-abortion ideas and the spread of anti-vaccine ideas.
至于国内，2003 年 SARS 之后，大家对疾控比较重视，中国重金打造了一套疫情直报系统，但没有疫情之后，疾控的声音就弱了。
At home, after SARS in 2003, people paid more attention to disease control. China invested heavily in a direct reporting system, but without the outbreak, the disease control voice became weaker.
中国疾控系统跟美国不同，其职工不是公务员，而是事业单位编制。
Unlike the United States, China's disease-control system is staffed not by civil servants, but by institutions.
有个具体问题就是，虽然待遇不太差，但没有住房福利，一些青年骨干就流失了，比如流失到学术机构，如复旦大学和中山大学。
One particular problem is that without housing benefits, some of the young cadres are lost, for example, to academic institutions such as Fudan University and Zhongshan University, although not so badly paid.
DeepTech：目前中国疾控系统被批评说，研究人员急着去发论文了，而在防疫上显得作为不够。
DeepTech: China's disease-control system has been criticised for rushing out papers and not doing enough to prevent the disease.
陈茁：首先得声明一下，我本身在美国疾控中心工作多年，在中国疾控系统有很多朋友，我的观点可能会有倾向性，但没有纯粹的利益冲突。
MR. CHEN: First of all, I would like to state that I have been working in the CDC for many years, and I have many friends in China's disease control system.
他们发表的文章都是团队的工作，不是一个人的工作，然后还有湖北疾控系统参与。
The articles they publish are the work of a team, not a person's job, followed by the Hubei disease control system.
另外，发表论文也是让国际知道疫情的一种方式，这是国际惯例。
In addition, the publication of papers is also a way to let the international community know about the epidemic, which is international practice.
还有就是，中国疾控中心没有公布疫情的权限，官方发布都是从卫健委或应急办出来。
Also, the China CDC has no authority to publicize the epidemic, and official announcements are made from the Health Protection Commission or emergency response.
DeepTech：我们一直关注专业技术意见的话语权，目前看专业意见发挥了多大效力？陈茁：我没有特别做这个调查，但是从国家层面上来说，我觉得从法理上疾控机构应该有发布疫情的法定权力。
We have been paying close attention to the voice of professional technical opinions, and how effective is the professional opinionChen: I did not make this investigation specially, but at the national level, I think the CDC should have the legal authority to issue epidemic reports.
中国这方面这些年在探索、在摸索，但是有的方面可能没有梳理得特别清楚。
China has been exploring and groping in recent years, but some aspects may not have been combed out clearly.
比如，现在健康教育和中国疾控中心是分开的。
For example, health education is now separate from China's CDC.
健康教育或健康传播其实是疾控系统一个大的功能，如果分开的话肯定是有利有弊，怎么来协调？需要国家的智慧。
Health education or health communication is actually a major function of disease control system, if it is divided into advantages and disadvantages, how to coordinate? Need national wisdom.
再比如说，疾控中心如果有了权力去发布疫情，也需要同时向大众把专业知识以通俗易懂的形式解释清楚，降低公众的恐慌心理。
If, for example, the CDC had the power to deliver an epidemic, it would also need to explain its expertise to the public in understandable form, reducing public panic.
目前可能需要加强这方面的能力建设。
There may be a need to strengthen capacity-building in this area.
DeepTech：在目前比较急迫的情况下，很多谣言和不准确的信息就会很多。
DeepTech: In the current urgency, a lot of rumors and inaccurate information will be available.
这就是你提到的健康教育问题吧？陈茁：对。
And that's the question of health educationChen: Yes.
不光是紧急情况下，在日常的时候，也有很多健康传播的事情要做。
Not only in emergencies, but also in everyday life, there are many things to be done to spread health.
比如说慢性病，它的防控其实也是很大的问题。
Chronic diseases, for example, are also a big problem.
很多老年人，甚至不仅是老年人，遵循医嘱的服药依从性较差。
Many elderly people, even the elderly, follow the instructions of the drug compliance is poor.
所以如何向公众特别是老年人解释，需要健康传播的专业人才来做这方面的宣传。
Therefore, how to explain to the public, especially the elderly, the need for health communication professionals to do this.
DeepTech：一个值得深入讨论的问题，李文亮的悲剧后面，我们应该如何对待吹哨人，如何发挥他们的作用又不会引发社会混乱？陈茁：我们可以参考国外的一些做法，把现有法规中禁止对提出批评的国家工作人员进行打击报复的条款细化，避免灰色地带。
After the tragedy of Li Wenliang, how should we deal with whistleblowers and how to play their role without causing social commotion? Chen: We may refer to some foreign practices and refine the provisions of the existing regulations that prohibit retaliation against critical state functionaries and avoid grey areas.
甚至可以延展到非公职人员，对国家机构甚至对企事业单位起到一个健康的监督作用。
It can even be extended to non-public officials, providing a healthy oversight role for State institutions and even for enterprises and institutions.
中国有《关于保护、奖励职务犯罪举报人的若干规定》，但是里面主要是针对举报犯罪行为，我不太清楚李医生的情形是不是适用。
China has some Provisions on the Protection and Rewarding of Whistleblowers on Duty Crimes, but they are mainly aimed at reporting crimes.
李医生的做法倒是可以参照美国吹哨人制度，比如可以考虑一些大部委设置类似检察院或者监察委的部门。
Dr Lee's approach could be modelled on the U. S. whistleblower system, for example by considering large ministries with similar prosecution or ombudsman offices.
美国卫生部有其独立的监督单位（Inspect General），负责审计，监督和保护卫生部所服务的人群。
The US Department of Health has its own independent oversight unit, which audits, supervises, and protects the people it serves.
专业部门的独立监督一方面保证独立性，起到监督作用；其独立于司法部门的设置也能迅速有效地应对专业问题。
Independent oversight of the professional sector, on the one hand, guarantees independence and acts as a watchdog; its independence from the judiciary also enables it to respond quickly and effectively to professional problems.
美国吹哨人可以实名向所属专业部委的独立监督单位提供信息，但是根据美国吹哨人保护法，这些单位必须保护吹哨人身份并确保其不受打击报复。
United States whistleblowers can provide information under their real names to independent oversight units in their professional ministries, but under the United States whistleblower protection laws, these units are required to protect whistleblowers and ensure they are protected from retaliation.
当然，美国吹哨人保护法经历了很多修订，最近的一次是在 2012 年，就目前的一些情形来看也算不得完美。
Of course, the US whistleblower protection law has undergone many revisions, most recently in 2012, and is not perfect in some cases.
广义的美国吹哨人保护其实比较多，也很繁杂，有其各自适用的对象和范畴。
The protection of whistle-blowers in the broad sense of the word is more and more complicated, and has its own applicable object and category.
一般来说，实名举报不会有太多的虚假指控，监督单位的专业处理应该不会引发社会混乱。
Generally speaking, the real name report will not be too many false accusations, the professional handling of the supervisory unit should not cause social chaos.
当然，这只是美国的经验，我们国家国情不同，可以汲取其经验教训，在借鉴之余也需要搞清楚其背景。
Of course, this is only the United States experience, our country situation is different, can learn from its lessons, but also need to understand its background.
