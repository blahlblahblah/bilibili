本报记者 晏耀斌 武汉报道1月25日，大年初一，护士高琴（化名）一早就随着120出诊了，她在武汉一家定点接收新冠肺炎医院里当护士。
Our reporter Yan Yaobin Wuhan reported January 25, the New Year's Day, nurses Gao Qin (alias) with 120 out of the early morning, she received a fixed point in Wuhan New Crown Pneumonia Hospital as a nurse.
当她将两名危重病人送到医院后，医院以没有床位却拒绝接收。
When she took two critically ill people to hospital, the hospital refused to accept them because there were no beds.
“不是床位的问题，是防护用品缺乏，医护人员没有防护用品，存在风险。
"It's not the bed problem, it's the lack of protective equipment, the absence of protective equipment for the medical staff and the risks.
”高琴了解后才知道。
"Gao Qin did not know until she knew.
这两个病人来自武汉汉阳，夫妻两人感染发烧七八天了，在家实在受不了，住院证已经开出，就是住不进医院。
The two patients from Wuhan Hanyang, husband and wife have been infected with fever for seven or eight days, can not bear at home, hospital certificates have been issued, is not admitted to the hospital.
高琴交谈中还发现，这对夫妻中的男人，他的同事有六七个已经确诊为新冠肺炎。
Gaoqin also found that the couple of men, his colleagues have been diagnosed with six or seven new crown pneumonia.
高琴感到心焦。
Gaoqin was worried.
一直奔波在一线的她，这几天看到了急诊患者“住院之难”。
She has been running around the line, the last few days to see the emergency patients "hospital difficult."
“大量拿着住院证等候通知的病人，恰似一个个移动的传染源，却处在失控状态。
"A large number of patients with hospital certificates waiting to be notified are like a moving source of infection, but they are out of control.
”联防联控新冠肺炎，武汉准备好了吗？高琴认为，这不仅是重大的疫情，而且是最大的政治。
Is Wuhan ready to fight the New Crown Pneumonia? Not only is it a major outbreak, but it is also the biggest politics, Gao said.
120护士高琴的遭遇，距离武汉发现第一天新冠肺炎已经27天，距离武汉宣布定点医院已经过去4天了，距离武汉封城已经过去了2天。
It has been 27 days since Wuhan first discovered the new crown pneumonia, four days since Wuhan announced the appointment of a hospital, and two days since the city was closed in Wuhan.
截至25日下午15时，来自武汉的新冠肺炎全国确诊1383例，死亡41例，其中武汉572例，死亡38例。
As of 15: 00 pm on the 25th, 1,383 cases and 41 deaths had been confirmed in Wuhan, including 572 cases and 38 deaths.
医生缺乏防护高琴看到病人很无助，没有心情过这个春节。
The doctor lacks protective harp. Seeing the patient is helpless, he is not in the mood for the Spring Festival.
“家人担忧也没有用，这是医生的工作，也是最大的政治，哪有心情过年。
"It's no use worrying about your family. It's the doctor's job and the biggest politics.
”高琴接受《中国经营报》记者采访时表示，她所在的医院已经有医护人员感染。
In an interview with the China Business Daily, Gaoqin said medical staff had been infected in her hospital.
120属于最前线，她所在的120小组总共5人，每天出车在10趟以上。
She is on the front line, with a total of five members in her 120-member team, travelling more than 10 times a day.
据她介绍，能保障的是一天只发一个N95口罩。
The guarantee, she says, is to give out only one N95 mask a day.
按规定，医护人员接触了病人就应该换一个口罩，而隔离衣要穿几天才能换，期间反复消毒反复穿。
As a rule, medical staff should change a mask when they come into contact with a patient, and the isolation clothes can only be changed for a few days.
鞋套用的是居家鞋套，正规隔离鞋套应该到膝盖的那种。
Shoes are fitted with a home shoe cover, the regular isolation shoe cover should be to the knee of the kind.
高琴反映的情况从武汉的求助得以印证。
Gaoqin reflects the situation from Wuhan's help can be verified.
1月23日，武汉新冠肺炎防控指挥部公开发布物资捐助清单，十万医护人员紧急缺乏护目镜、N95口罩、外科口罩、一次性医用口罩、医用帽、防护服、手术衣等医用物品。
On January 23, Wuhan Xinguan Pneumonia Control Command issued a list of public donations of materials, 100,000 medical personnel urgently lack goggles, N95 masks, surgical masks, disposable medical masks, medical caps, protective clothing, surgical clothes and other medical items.
高琴表示，医生害怕是正常的。
Gao said doctors were afraid it was normal.
1月21日，武汉指定了定点接收病人医院后，很多人开始打电话或者亲自去定点医院咨询。
On January 21, Wuhan designated a designated hospital to receive patients, many people began to call or go to the hospital in person to consult.
冬季正值流感高发期，彼时医院已经爆满。
Winter was at the height of the flu season, when the hospital was full.
22日，高琴接到一个病人。
On the 22nd, Gaoqin received a patient.
这个病人到定点医院武汉第五医院看病，做了CT确诊为新冠肺炎，因为无法住院，又怕回家传染给家属，就在医院附近一个旅馆住下。
The patient went to Wuhan Fifth Hospital of Dingdian Hospital, where he was diagnosed with New Crown Pneumonia on CT. He stayed in a hotel near the hospital because he could not be hospitalized and was afraid to go home and infect his family.
这个病人，上午从武昌青山区到汉口医院看了急诊，汉口医院又让他到第五医院。
This patient, from Wuchang Qingshan District to Hankou Hospital to see the emergency, Hankou Hospital let him to the Fifth Hospital.
旅馆老板发现这个“客人”不对劲，就报警了。
The innkeeper discovered that something was wrong with the "guest" and called the police.
120救护车到了，110警车也到了，他告诉高琴，他被确诊为新冠肺炎。
120 ambulance arrived, police car 110 arrived, he told Gaoqin, he was diagnosed with new crown pneumonia.
高琴感到诧异，这个病人连个口罩都没戴。
Gao Qin was surprised. The patient did not even wear a mask.
他从武昌到汉口，又跑到位于汉阳的第五医院。
From Wuchang to Hankou, he went to the Fifth Hospital in Hanyang.
高琴赶快给他戴了两层口罩。
Gouqin quickly put on two masks for him.
“太危险了，他就是一个移动传染源。
"It's too dangerous. He's a mobile source of infection.
”高琴后来发现，医院没有床位是假，防护用品缺乏是真，医护人员没有防护用品，存在风险。
Gao later found that the hospital's lack of beds was fake, that the lack of protective equipment was real and that medical staff were at risk without protective equipment.
医院未准备好没有准备反应迟缓，怕是武汉这次疫情快速传播的问题所在。
The hospital was unprepared and unprepared to react slowly, probably the problem of the rapid spread of the epidemic in Wuhan.
定点通知前，武汉各个医院呼吸发热门诊都是爆满的，各个病人自己正常寻找医院。
Before the fixed-point notification, Wuhan hospitals are full of respiratory fever clinics, each patient their own normal search for hospitals.
定点医院公布后，医院才开始做隔离病房等工作，此时距离武汉发现新冠肺炎已经过去了21天。
Only after the announcement of the designated hospital did the hospital begin work on the isolation ward, 21 days after Wuhan discovered the new crown pneumonia.
高琴所在的医院，在1月21日成为定点医院后，到1月23日凌晨6点才开始正式接收病人。
Gaoqin's hospital, which became a designated hospital on January 21, did not officially accept patients until 6 a.m. on January 23.
高琴告诉《中国经营报》记者，一般情况下，确诊后医院也不一定会收治，住院证开出后，医生开药，让病人回家等通知，因为防护用品不到位。
Gaoqin told China Business Daily that in general, hospitals do not always accept patients after a diagnosis. After a hospital certificate is issued, doctors prescribe medicines and tell patients to go home, because protective equipment is not in place.
截至23日18点，高琴得到的消息是住院部有几百人在等通知，门诊还有几百人也在等通知。
As of 18: 00 on the 23rd, Gao Qin was informed that hundreds of people were waiting to be notified in the inpatient department, and hundreds were waiting to be notified at the clinic.
“这些病人过去登记后，继续等床位。
"These patients used to register and continue to wait for beds.
登记结束，病人自行活动，等通知，疫情如何能不扩散出去？”因为21日晚上的一个病人，高琴愤怒地哭了。
After the registration was over, the patient moved on his own, and so on, how could the outbreak not spread? "Gaoqin cried angrily at a patient on the night of the 21st.
当天晚上，高琴在接到急救电话后，按照病人的要求把病人从汉阳送到定点医院——武汉市第四医院西院。
That night, Gao Qin received the first-aid call, according to the patient's request from Hanyang to the point hospital - Wuhan Fourth Hospital West Hospital.
之前，病人在中山医院就诊已有了结果。
Earlier, patients at Zhongshan Hospital have had results.
危机中，病人还紧急咨询了专家，专家告诉他很严重。
During the crisis, the patient also consulted an expert, who told him that it was serious.
第四医院西院告诉120，没有床位。
The West Hospital of Hospital No. 4 told 120 that there were no beds.
此后，病人家属打遍了武汉市所有部门的电话，两个多小时也没有结果。
Since then, the patient's family has called all the Wuhan city departments, more than two hours have also been fruitless.
120只好求助值班调度，值班又求助武汉市卫健委，卫健委下指令让医院收治，第四医院西院还是以没有床位拒绝。
120 had to call on duty scheduling, duty and call Wuhan health committee, Wei health care commission under the order to hospital admission, the Fourth Hospital West Hospital or no beds refused.
后来，家属怒了，直接把病人抬到抢救室，抢救室有空床，120这样才放下病人就离开了。
Later, the family became angry and carried the patient directly to the emergency room, where there was an empty bed.
“从晚上11点到凌晨1点，病人放在120上整整两个小时。
"From 11 p.m. to 1 a.m., the patient stayed on 120 for a full two hours.
”像这样被拒收的经历很多，高琴已经习惯了。
"There were many experiences with rejection like this, and Gaoqin was used to it.
她不知道武汉抗击新冠肺炎的准备工作何时能做好，也不知道自己能够坚持多久。
She does not know when Wuhan will be ready to fight the new crown pneumonia, and do not know how long they can persist.
公开信息显示，自武汉从2019年12月30日发现新冠肺炎，直到2020年1月21日，武汉乃至湖北方面才开始重视这轮疫情。
According to public information, Wuhan from December 30, 2019 found the new crown pneumonia, until January 21, 2020, Wuhan and even Hubei began to pay attention to the round of the outbreak.
高琴其实不需要答案。
The harp doesn't really need an answer.
