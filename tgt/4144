巨灾风险治理问题已成为社会治理，乃至国家安全、经济发展和人民生活的突出问题，如何建立新型巨灾风险治理制度，实现“藏救灾能力于市场，藏重建能力于民”的目标？文|王和3月12日，国家卫生健康委新闻发言人宣布，总体上中国本轮新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情的流行高峰已经过去。
The issue of catastrophic risk management has become a prominent issue in social governance, as well as in national security, economic development and people's lives.How can a new disaster risk management system be set up to realize the goal of "Tibet disaster relief capacity in the market and Tibetan reconstruction capability for the people?
与此同时，中国境外的疫情状况却令人深忧，世界卫生组织总干事谭德塞在日内瓦举行的媒体通报会上宣布，新型冠状病毒肺炎进入全球大流行（pandemic）状态。
At the same time, the situation outside China is of grave concern. The World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General, Theresa Tupper, announced at a press briefing in Geneva that the new coronavirus pneumonia has entered a global pandemic.
目前抗疫还没有取得最终胜利，这场席卷了全球的疫情必将对社会、经济造成巨大影响。
At present, the fight against the disease has not won the final victory, the global epidemic will certainly have a huge social and economic impact.
也让人们开始思考，在现有的风险治理体系中，如何化解巨灾风险这一课题。
Also let people begin to think, in the existing risk management system, how to solve the subject of catastrophic risk.
巨灾包括重大自然灾害、重大公共安全事故和重大公共卫生事件（有的国家将“恐怖主义活动”也纳入其中），往往给国家安全、社会稳定、经济发展和人民生活造成巨大影响，比如长江洪灾、汶川地震以及这次的新冠疫情。
Catastrophes include major natural disasters, major public-safety accidents, and major public-health events (including, in some countries, "terrorist activities"), which often have a huge impact on national security, social stability, economic development, and people's lives, such as the Yangtze River floods, the Wenchuan earthquake, and this new crowning epidemic.
由于巨灾具有难以预测和管控、突发性强、影响范围广、损失巨大等特征，难以用常规的社会风险管理手段治理，也无法通过市场手段和商业模式进行管理。
Due to its difficult to predict and control, sudden strong, wide impact, huge losses, etc., it is difficult to use conventional means of social risk management, and management through market means and business models.
这使得巨灾风险治理成为一项世界性难题，同时也是威胁着人类社会持续发展的重大挑战。
This makes catastrophic risk management a worldwide problem, but also a major challenge to the sustainable development of human society.
在人类社会的发展过程中，各国一直努力解决巨灾风险治理问题，但总体上成效有限，多是应急性应对，缺乏未雨绸缪的制度安排和能力储备。
In the course of the development of human society, countries have been trying to solve the problem of disaster risk management, but overall the results have been limited, mostly in the form of emergency response, lack of proactive institutional arrangements and capacity reserves.
中国的巨灾风险治理一直采用自上而下的纵向模式，以政府为主导，以财政为依托，以行政干预进行全国动员，从而高效、快速、大规模地调动起公共资源和社会力量。
China adopts the vertical model of top-down disaster risk management, with the government as the leader, the financial support and the administrative intervention to mobilize the public resources and social forces efficiently, quickly and on a large scale.
客观来说，这种巨灾风险治理模式，符合中国发展初级阶段的国情，一次次演绎着巨灾风险治理的“中国故事”。
Objectively speaking, this catastrophic risk management mode, in line with China's initial stage of development, deduces time and again the "Chinese story" of disaster risk management.
不过，传统巨灾风险治理的这种模式面临诸多挑战。
However, this model of traditional catastrophic risk management faces many challenges.
经过这场新冠疫情洗礼之后，我们有必要系统地分析存在的问题和面临的挑战，探索如何在新的形势下建设具有中国特色的巨灾风险治理的新模式。
After the baptism of this new crown, it is necessary to systematically analyze the existing problems and challenges and explore how to build a new model of disaster risk management with Chinese characteristics under the new situation.
巨灾风险治理模式之困巨灾风险暴露是一种客观存在，与人类社会相伴相生。
Catastrophic risk management model of the risk exposure is an objective existence, and human society accompanied by each other.
随着社会进步和科技发达，巨灾风险暴露不仅没有降低，反而呈现聚集性、相关性和传染性增强的趋势，给经济和社会造成巨大影响。
With the development of social progress and science and technology, instead of decreasing, catastrophic risk exposure tends to be concentrated, relevant and contagious, with enormous economic and social impacts.
以这场仍在持续发酵中的新冠疫情为例，为了抗疫，中国付出了让经济停摆两个月的巨大代价。
Consider the ongoing outbreak of the new crown, which China paid a heavy price for stopping the economy for two months to fight the disease.
随着新冠疫情向全球漫延，全球经济亦受到重创。
As the new crown epidemic spreads globally, the global economy has been hit hard.
近期全球股市重挫，3月13日一天之间十国股价遭遇熔断，便充分显示了这场巨灾风险的威力。
The power of this catastrophic risk was amply demonstrated by the recent meltdown in global stock markets, with the 10-nation share price collapsing in one day on March 13.
巨灾风险治理问题已成为社会治理，乃至影响国家安全、经济发展和人民生活的突出问题。
Catastrophic risk management has become a prominent issue in social governance, even affecting national security, economic development and people's lives.
中国传统的巨灾风险治理模式，有一个重要特征是以财政资金作为巨灾风险治理的资金保障，具有主体单一、决策迅速、执行刚性等优势。
An important feature of China's traditional disaster risk management model is that it takes financial funds as the financial guarantee for disaster risk management, with advantages of single subject, rapid decision-making and rigidity of execution.
但随着中国社会和经济的发展，这种模将面临越来越严峻的“收支困境”。
But with the development of Chinese society and economy, this model will face more and more severe "balance of payments dilemma."
尤其是在财政刚性支出项目众多的情况下，地方财政已捉襟见肘，能够安排的巨灾风险治理预算和资金储备非常有限。
Especially in the case of a large number of fiscal rigidities, local finance is already overstretched, and the management budget and financial reserves of catastrophic risks are very limited.
而巨灾风险治理的资金需求，特别是重建资金保障，则面临“水涨船高”之势。
But the catastrophic risk management fund demand, especially the reconstruction fund safeguard, is facing the "rising tide" tendency.
作为现代公共管理的一个重要评价指标是财政预算和执行的相对稳定，如果缺乏有效的巨灾风险治理机制，可能因救灾和重建因素，导致财政尤其是局部财政预算的不稳定甚至剧烈波动，让灾后区域经济和财政陷入恶性循环的局面。
As an important evaluation index of modern public management is the relative stability of budget and execution, if there is no effective disaster risk management mechanism, the disaster relief and reconstruction factors may lead to the instability and even drastic fluctuations of the financial, especially the local budgets, and put the post-disaster regional economy and finance into a vicious circle.
另外，巨灾风险治理的绝大部分工作由政府财政承担，这种事权和财权的分配方式，既不符合现代社会治理和公共管理的基本原则，容易导致社会新的不公平，也面临资源短缺、效率不高、难以为继的问题。
Moreover, the great majority of the work of disaster risk management is undertaken by government finances. This distribution of authority and financial power is not in accordance with the basic principles of governance and public administration in modern society. It is also prone to new social inequities and to resource shortages, inefficiency and unsustainability.
更重要的是，容易产生“搭便车”和“等、靠、要”的投机和依赖心理，导致巨灾风险治理的社会总效率不高。
More importantly, easy to generate "hitchhiking" and "wait, rely on, to" speculation and dependence psychology, leading to catastrophic risk management of the overall social efficiency is not efficient.
而区域间的转移支付，因为缺乏法理依据，可能导致新的不公平现象。
Interregional transfers, for lack of a legal basis, could lead to new inequities.
基于这种现状，中国巨灾风险治理体系需要与时俱进。
Based on the present situation, China's disaster risk management system needs to keep up with the times.
这既有全面深化改革，实现治理体系和能力现代化的发展战略需要，更有确保公共管理资源，特别是财政预算稳定和经济可持续的现实需要。
This goes hand in hand with the need for a comprehensive and in-depth reform of development strategies to modernize governance systems and capacities, as well as the real need to ensure public management resources, in particular budgetary stability and economic sustainability.
认识巨灾风险治理的“公共性”构建巨灾风险治理体系的关键要解决好定性和定位问题，定位的前提是深刻理解巨灾风险的特征。
Understanding the "publicity" of catastrophe risk management is the key to solving the problem of classification and location. The premise of locating is to understand the characteristics of catastrophe risk.
巨灾风险通常具有四大特征：一是影响的普遍性，具有显著的公共属性；二是后果的巨灾性，造成的损失金额巨大，非个体和区域能够承受；三是发生的偶然性，巨灾发生往往无规律可循，难以进行预测和防范；四是处理的局限性，巨灾损失不适用大数法则，不能用商业保险等市场手段进行处理。
Catastrophic risk usually has four characteristics: one is the universality of the impact, which has a prominent public attribute; the other is the catastrophic nature of the consequences, which is too large for individuals and regions to bear; and thirdly, the occurrence of catastrophic events is often irregular and difficult to predict and prevent.
这意味着，巨灾风险治理属于公共管理领域，相关的服务属于公共和准公共产品的范畴，这是巨灾风险治理体系建设的理论基础和逻辑依据。
This means that catastrophic risk management belongs to the public management field, and the related services belong to the public and quasi-public goods, which is the theoretical basis and logical basis for the construction of catastrophe risk management system.
明确巨灾风险治理的公共属性，目的是防止将巨灾风险治理简单地交给市场的倾向。
In order to prevent the tendency of handing over catastrophic risk management to the market, the public attributes of catastrophe risk management are clarified.
因为，无论是风险特征还是管理能力，无论是精算失灵还是市场失效，无论是设计思路，还是最终结果，市场和保险均难以“独当大任”。
Because neither risk characteristics nor management capabilities, whether actuarial or market failures, design thinking or end results, can "do it alone."
国外经验和中国的探索，均充分证明了这一点。
This has been amply demonstrated by foreign experience and Chinese exploration.
从中国的实践来看，一个最突出的问题就是缺乏对巨灾风险治理“公共性”的深刻认识，简单地把这一重任交给保险业。
From China's practice, one of the most prominent problems is the lack of a deep understanding of the "public nature" of disaster risk management, simply to the insurance industry.
已经高度市场化的保险业往往“心有余而力不足”，最终陷入一种“讨价还价”的博弈，导致巨灾保险制度的“畸形”和“先天不足”。
The insurance industry, which is already highly market-oriented, tends to fall into a "bargain" game, leading to "malformations" and "innate deficiencies" in catastrophe insurance.
一旦发生巨灾，其能够发挥的作用相对有限，使得巨灾保险制度建设与发展陷入一种“鸡肋”局面。
Once catastrophic, it can play a relatively limited role in the construction and development of catastrophe insurance system into a "chicken rib" situation.
巨灾风险治理先做“减法”党的十九届四中全会提出：在解决关系国计民生的重大项目中，应发挥好“新型举国体制”的作用。
Catastrophic risk management first "subtraction" the 19th plenary session of the Fourth Central Committee of the Party put forward: In solving major projects related to the people's livelihood, the role of the "new juguo system" should be brought into play.
因此，巨灾风险治理亦需思考如何构建新体制下的巨灾风险治理模式。
Therefore, catastrophe risk management also needs to consider how to construct the catastrophe risk management model under the new system.
巨灾风险治理的进化逻辑在于创新，“新型”的关键是政府在巨灾风险治理中的作用和作为要“新”，不再让政府“大包大揽”，而是通过制度创新，全面整合和调动市场和社会资源，重构巨灾风险治理体制，重新配置全社会的巨灾风险治理责任。
The evolutionary logic of catastrophe risk management lies in innovation. The key of the "new" is the government's role and action in disaster risk management. The key is not to let the government "do all the work," but to reconstruct the disaster risk management system and reconfigure the whole society's responsibility of disaster risk management.
概括来说，用“社会”解决治理资源的利用范围和可持续问题，用“市场”解决资源配置的公平和效率问题，最终实现更大程度地“藏救灾能力于市场，藏重建能力于民（社会）”的目标。
In a nutshell, "society" should solve the problem of using resources in a sustainable way, and "market" should be used to solve the problem of allocating resources in a fair and efficient way.
如果只是简单地采用市场机制建立的巨灾保险制度，往往容易陷入“治理逻辑”和“偿付能力”的双重困境。
If we simply adopt the catastrophe insurance system established by market mechanism, it is easy to fall into the double predicament of "governance logic" and "solvency."
因此，构建中国的新型巨灾风险治理模式，核心诉求是通过建立巨灾保险制度，尽可能地制度性剥离政府职责，转移行政成本。
Therefore, to build a new disaster risk management model in China, the core demand is to establish catastrophe insurance system, as far as possible to remove government responsibility and transfer administrative costs.
高度重视和充分发挥商业保险的作用，发挥风险管理的主观能动性，减少对社会和政府的依赖，降低社会风险暴露水平，提高社会风险管理的总效率。
We should attach great importance to and give full play to the role of commercial insurance, bring into play the subjective initiative of risk management, reduce dependence on society and government, reduce the level of social risk exposure, and improve the overall efficiency of social risk management.
剥离政府职责的逻辑是做“减法”，前提是要明确两个问题，一是巨灾风险的特征决定了任何一个市场制度，均不可能提供彻底的解决方案。
The logic of divesting the government of its responsibilities is to "subtract," provided two issues are made clear. First, the characteristics of catastrophic risk dictate that no market system can provide a complete solution.
因此，巨灾保险制度只能在一定程度上分担职责和剥离，政府乃至社会始终要扮演“兜底”的角色，逐渐实现从“全部责任”到“部分责任”，再到“兜底责任”的进步。
Therefore, catastrophe insurance system can only share the responsibility and peel off to a certain extent, the government and even the society should always play the role of "bottom-up" and gradually realize the progress from "full responsibility" to "partial responsibility" and then "responsibility under the pocket."
二是新型巨灾风险治理模式的重要目的是利用巨灾保险平台，改变“单一模式”，通过市场机制和激励手段，特别是税收优惠手段，强化企业和居民的风险主体意识，共同参与到巨灾风险的资金准备，实现多元化的责任主体和风险分摊的社会合作机制。
Second, the important aim of the new catastrophe risk management mode is to change the "single mode" by using catastrophe insurance platform, strengthen the sense of risk subject of enterprises and residents through market mechanism and incentive means, especially tax preferential means, participate in the capital preparation of catastrophe risk, realize diversified responsibility subject and social cooperation mechanism of risk sharing.
从技术的角度来看，能力问题的本质是偿付能力问题，即如何做到保得起、赔得起，如何确保巨灾保险制度不至于破产的问题。
From a technical point of view, the essence of the issue of capacity is solvency, that is, how to be affordable and affordable and how to ensure that catastrophe insurance systems are not bankrupt.
偿付能力管理是各国在巨灾保险制度建设中难以回避的问题，也是一大难题。
The solvency management is a difficult problem for all countries in the construction of catastrophe insurance system.
因为，巨灾风险的损失往往是巨大的，难以用传统精算、定价和准备金的方式进行管理。
Because catastrophic risk losses are often large, they are difficult to manage using traditional actuarial, pricing and provisioning methods.
在制度建设中往往容易陷入一种矛盾，一方面认识到巨灾保险制度建设的必要性，另一方面又觉得既然巨灾保险制度不可能彻底转移风险，便质疑制度建设的科学性。
In the system construction, it is easy to fall into a contradiction. On the one hand, we recognize the necessity of catastrophe insurance system construction, on the other hand, we think that since catastrophe insurance system is impossible to transfer the risk completely, we question the scientific nature of system construction.
巨灾保险制度尤其是在建设的初期，肯定不能解决巨灾风险治理，尤其是资金保障的全部问题。
Catastrophic insurance system, especially in the early stage of construction, certainly can not solve the catastrophe risk management, especially the whole problem of financial security.
随着制度的不断完善和资金的不断积累，制度的能力将不断提升，与政府的巨灾风险治理能力形成一种“逐步接替”的效果。
With the continuous improvement of the system and the accumulation of funds, the capacity of the system will continue to improve, and the government's disaster risk management capacity to form a "step-by-step" effect.
在“减法”逻辑下，可以将巨灾风险损失进一步区分为“一般巨灾损失”和“特别巨灾损失”，明确巨灾保险制度的目标是循序渐进地接替财政的“一般巨灾损失”负担，而“特别巨灾损失”则需要作为政府和财政的“自留风险”。
Under the logic of "subtraction," catastrophe risk loss can be further divided into "general catastrophic losses" and "particularly catastrophic losses." The goal of catastrophe insurance system is to gradually take over the burden of "ordinary catastrophic losses" of finance, while "exceptionally catastrophic losses" need to be regarded as "self-retaining risks" for governments and finances.
这部分损失风险处理，一方面是巨灾保险制度面临“失灵”问题，解决不了可能使制度建设陷入“死循环”，另一方面可能面临转移成本过高，通过政府扮演“最终再保人”的角色，对于特殊巨灾风险损失采用“自留风险”的方式，则相对社会效率最优。
On the one hand, catastrophe insurance system faces the problem of "failure." On the other hand, it can not solve the "dead-end cycle" of institution-building. On the other hand, it may be too costly to transfer.
同时，从国外的先进经验来看，可以通过立法，建立“回调机制”，解决巨灾保险的“击穿风险”，确保政府“自留风险”的相对有限与可控。
At the same time, from the advanced experience of foreign countries, we can establish a "callback mechanism" through legislation to solve the "breakdown risk" of catastrophe insurance and ensure that the government's "risk retention" is relatively limited and controllable.
因此，要坚持政府主导不主办，引导不经办，鼓励不包办，放手不撒手的原则，充分发挥制度优势，确保风险治理方案的稳步实施。
Therefore, we should adhere to the principle of government-led not to host, guide not to do business, encourage not to do so, let go of the principle of not giving up, make full use of institutional advantages, ensure the steady implementation of risk management programmes.
构建多层次巨灾保险机制巨灾保险制度可以充分利用商业保险市场在筹集、管理和分配重建资金方面的制度优势。
Establishing catastrophe insurance system of multi-level catastrophe insurance mechanism can make full use of the institutional advantages of commercial insurance market in raising, managing and distributing reconstruction funds.
不过，在新型举国体制下，巨灾保险制度也要在新逻辑下，重构治理的组织体系。
However, under the new juguo system, the catastrophe insurance system should reconstruct the management organization system under the new logic.
重构的基本逻辑在于，要明确巨灾风险治理的公共属性和巨灾保险制度的有限性特征，可以通过社会合作机制，发挥保险市场的效率优势，建立一种社会化的基于长期积累的逐步分摊和承接机制，以降低政府和财政在灾后重建资金方面的压力。
The basic logic of reconstruction is to clarify the public attributes of catastrophe risk management and the limited characteristics of catastrophe insurance system. Through the social cooperation mechanism, the efficiency advantage of the insurance market can be brought into play and a socialized mechanism of gradual assessment and transfer based on long-term accumulation can be established to reduce the pressure on government and finance in post-disaster reconstruction funds.
建设新型巨灾保险制度，既要强化政府的主导作用，突出“放管有度”，引导和鼓励市场和社会参与管理，又不能简单地放手；既要充分发挥市场和社会的力量，又要确保结构科学和制度有效；既要强调效率，又要兼顾安全和公平；既要确保制度设计的科学合理，又要确保制度尽快落地，在实施的过程中不断完善。
To build a new type of catastrophe insurance system, we should not only strengthen the leading role of the government, emphasize "deregulation," guide and encourage the market and society to participate in management, but not simply let go.
就具体模式而言，可以采用“创新机制，分工合作，优势互补，纵横结合”，在事前风险防范和灾后恢复重建阶段，尽可能地引入社会和市场的力量，参与治理体系建设，尤其是通过巨灾保险，构建事后重建资金的共同积累机制。
In terms of specific models, innovative mechanisms, division of labor and cooperation, complementarity of advantages and horizontal integration can be adopted to bring in social and market forces as far as possible during the pre-disaster prevention and post-disaster recovery and reconstruction phases, and participate in the building of governance systems, especially through catastrophe insurance.
首先，巨灾保险制度要建立一个统筹协调的机制平台，即全国巨灾保险基金及其理事会。
First, catastrophe insurance system should establish a platform of integrated and coordinated mechanism, namely the National Catastrophe Insurance Fund and its Board of Directors.
这个平台既有资金账户的概念，更有统筹、指导和协调的职能。
The platform has both a fund account concept and a more integrated, directing and coordinating function.
在制度建设的初期，由于涉及大量基础性和协调性工作，特别是相关立法等，因此，平台应具有一定的行政色彩，确保权威性和统筹效率，待制度基本成熟，尤其是基金积累达到一定规模后，便可以逐步淡化行政色彩，过渡为具有PPP性质的“共保体”组织。
In the early stages of institution building, because of the extensive basic and coordinated work involved, especially the relevant legislation, the platform should have a certain administrative color, ensure authority and overall efficiency, and when the system is basically mature, especially after the fund accumulates to a certain scale, it can gradually dilute the administrative color and transition to a PPP-like "coalescing organization."
全国巨灾保险基金理事会可以依托中国保险保障基金公司，采用“两块牌子，一套人马”的模式，采用“统分结合”的模式，即按照自然灾害、公共安全和公共卫生分别建立巨灾保险基金，各司其职，各负其责。
The National Catastrophe Insurance Fund Board can rely on the China Insurance Guarantee Fund Corporation to adopt the "two brands, one set of people" model, using the "integrated combination" model, that is, to establish catastrophe insurance funds according to natural disasters, public security and public health, each with its own responsibilities.
同时，在自然灾害巨灾保险基金下，可以根据管理的需要设立子基金，如居民住宅地震巨灾保险基金和农业保险巨灾保险基金。
At the same time, under the Catastrophe Insurance Fund for Natural Disasters, sub-funds, such as the Residential Earthquake Catastrophe Insurance Fund and the Agricultural Insurance Catastrophe Insurance Fund, may be established according to the needs of management.
巨灾保险基金在“全国基金”的框架下，实现各分类基金和各子基金之间的统筹与调剂，实现基金效用的最大化。
Catastrophe Insurance Fund in the framework of the "National Fund," the classification funds and sub-funds between the overall planning and transfer, to achieve the maximum effectiveness of the Fund.
按照中国财政资源管理的逻辑、各地巨灾风险暴露的情况差异以及经济发展水平的不同，可以建立“两级管理”模式，即建立全国和各省两级基金，既兼顾各省的巨灾风险和财政能力差异，又确保巨灾风险基金分配的相对公平。
According to the logic of China's financial resources management, differences in the exposure of local catastrophic risks, and different levels of economic development, a "two-tier management" model could be established, that is, a fund at the national and provincial levels that would balance catastrophic risk and financial capacity differences among provinces and ensure a relatively fair allocation of catastrophe risk funds.
全国巨灾保险基金对省级巨灾保险基金可以通过“再保险”的方式进行支持，这种“再保险”既是保险技术的概念，也可以赋予其转移支付的功能。
The National Catastrophe Insurance Fund can support provincial catastrophe insurance funds by "reinsurance," which is both a concept of insurance technology and a function of transfer payments.
在全国巨灾保险基金下，可以设立巨灾保险共保体，作为管理、协调和交互的平台，同时作为全国巨灾保险基金和省级巨灾保险基金的实施主体，将相关政策和巨灾基金转化为推动巨灾保险制度实施的市场资源，以确保制度的落地。
Under the National Catastrophe Insurance Fund, a catastrophe insurance co-insurance system could be established as a platform for management, coordination and interaction, as well as an implementing agent of the National Catastrophe Insurance Fund and the Provincial Catastrophe Insurance Fund, transforming relevant policies and catastrophe funds into market resources to promote the implementation of catastrophe insurance systems to ensure their landing.
另一方面，巨灾保险共保体还扮演经营管理巨灾保险业务的行业自治组织，制定相关制度，开发产品，精算定价，费用政策，统一协调和管理保险市场和保险公司，以及再保险和资本市场。
On the other hand, catastrophe insurance co-insurers also act as industry self-governing organizations operating and managing catastrophe insurance, developing systems, developing products, actuarial pricing, cost policies, harmonizing and managing insurance markets and insurance companies, as well as reinsurance and capital markets.
在制度建设的初期，巨灾保险共保体可以作为全国巨灾保险基金理事会的一个内设机构，待制度成熟之后，逐步将其剥离成为相对独立的行业自治组织。
In the early stage of institution-building, catastrophe insurance co-insurance system can be regarded as a built-in organization of the National Catastrophe Insurance Fund Board.
巨灾保险共保体也可以采用依托“中国城乡居民住宅地震巨灾保险共同体”和上海保险交易所的模式，在前期“居民住宅地震巨灾保险”实践的基础上，扩大范围，增加功能。
Catastrophe insurance co-insurance can also rely on the "China Urban and Rural Residential Earthquake Catastrophe Insurance Community" and the Shanghai Insurance Exchange model, based on the previous "residential earthquake catastrophe insurance practice," to expand the scope and increase the functions.
巨灾保险制度涉及大量公共利益的调整，需要加快推进《巨灾保险法》以及相关法律法规的制定和完善工作，确保巨灾保险制度的建设和运行，做到有法可依和有法必依。
Catastrophe insurance system involves a lot of adjustment of public interests. It is necessary to accelerate the enactment and improvement of Catastrophe Insurance Law and relevant laws and regulations to ensure the construction and operation of catastrophe insurance system.
如何化解偿付能力难题偿付能力始终是巨灾保险制度建设的难题，那么，新型巨灾保险制度的实施路径，要将“偿付能力难题”作为突破的重点。
How to solve the solvency problem is always a difficult problem in the construction of catastrophe insurance system. Then, the way to implement the new catastrophe insurance system should focus on the "solvency problem."
对于巨灾保险基金的来源，财政资金的投入可以“量力而行”，不必追求规模，可以充分利用“财政信用”资源，提供付款承诺、紧急融资、融资担保和贴息、发行特别国债等方式来解决资金问题，特别是初期和短期资金融通的问题。
With regard to the sources of catastrophe insurance funds, the input of financial funds can be "commensurate with one's ability," without the need for scale, so as to make full use of "financial credit" resources, provide payment commitments, emergency financing, guarantee and discount financing, and issue special government bonds to solve financial problems, especially initial and short-term financing.
此外，也可以通过发行巨灾彩票的方式筹集资金。
In addition, funds could be raised through the issuance of catastrophe lotteries.
巨灾保险基金作为统筹协调和管理国内外社会捐赠的平台，可以运用金融工程技术，分解巨灾风险，差异化匹配风险，创新解决工具。
Catastrophic insurance funds, as platforms for overall coordination and management of domestic and foreign social donations, can use financial engineering techniques to decompose catastrophic risks, differentiate and match risks, and create innovative solutions.
通过巨灾证券化、巨灾债券和巨灾期权等方式，充分利用国内外资本市场分散风险。
Through catastrophe securitization, catastrophe bonds and catastrophe option, the risk diversification of domestic and foreign capital market is fully utilized.
此外，投保巨灾保险作为银行融资的前提条件，也可以进一步提高巨灾保险的投保率和覆盖面，并体现制度的公共性。
In addition, catastrophe insurance as a prerequisite for bank financing can further improve the coverage rate and coverage of catastrophe insurance, and reflect the public nature of the system.
化解偿付能力难题，还得益于风险防范水平的提升，并通过科技赋能，提高巨灾风险治理效率。
Solving the solvency problem also benefits from the level of risk prevention, and through scientific and technological empowerment, to improve the efficiency of catastrophic risk management.
近年来，感测技术、卫星遥感、生物识别、物联网、大数据、人工智能、区块链等科技在巨灾风险防控中得到极大的应用，比如本次新冠疫情中用手机定位系统开展确诊和疑似患者追踪。
In recent years, sensor technology, satellite remote sensing, bio-identification, Internet of Things, big data, artificial intelligence, block chain, etc. have been widely used in disaster risk prevention and control, such as cell phone targeting for diagnosis and suspected patient tracking in this new crown.
运用科技手段建立全面感测和动态反馈的巨灾风险管理技术平台，可以实现科学管理和动态预警，从而降低了巨灾风险可能导致的损失。
It can realize scientific management and dynamic early warning by using scientific and technological means to set up a technological platform for disaster risk management which can reduce the potential losses caused by catastrophic risks.
尽管科技能够为巨灾风险治理提供更科学和高效的技术和解决方案，但需要通过建立一种商业模式，形成良性循环机制，从而促进巨灾风险治理科技的规范和有序发展。
While science and technology can provide more scientific and efficient technologies and solutions for catastrophic risk management, a virtuous cycle mechanism needs to be developed through the establishment of a business model that promotes the normative and orderly development of catastrophic risk management technologies.
巨灾保险基金平台特别是巨灾保险共保体，为巨灾风险治理科技力量提供了一个合作“窗口”，一方面能够引导科技企业，聚焦巨灾风险治理的难点和焦点问题，形成切实可行的解决方案，另一方面通过“集中采购”和“推荐使用”的手段，确保新技术的落地并形成持续发展的动力。
Catastrophe insurance funds platform, especially catastrophe insurance coinsurance, provides a window of cooperation for the scientific and technological forces in disaster risk management. On the one hand, it can guide scientific and technological enterprises, focus on the difficulties and focus of disaster risk management, and form practical solutions.
巨灾风险治理是一项长期任务，要循序渐进地推进巨灾风险治理机制的建设。
Catastrophic risk management is a long-term task, and the construction of catastrophic risk management mechanism should be promoted step by step.
在这场席卷全球的新冠疫情之后，也许会有一些新的变化。
In the wake of this new global crown epidemic, there may be some new changes.
