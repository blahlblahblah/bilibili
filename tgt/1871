留学生和学校都在承担损失限制入境、第三国隔离、无限期延期开学……新冠病毒疫情当前，回国过年的留学生面临返校难题。
International students and schools are bearing the loss of limited entry, third-country isolation, indefinite extension of the beginning of the school year...
从已经进行交通封锁和管制的鄂中城市，到疫情并不严重的其他省市，需要返校的留学生都面临不同困境。
Foreign students who need to go back to school face different difficulties, from the cities of OE, where traffic closures and controls have been imposed, to other provinces and cities where the epidemic is not serious.
而伴随延期返校带来的问题，让他们更加深感焦虑。
The problems associated with postponing their return to school add to their anxiety.
漂流在“第三国”的澳洲留学生在迪拜待了12天之后，酒店免费给林妍的房间从标间升级成了带客厅厨房的大套间。
After 12 days in Dubai, an Australian student drifting through a "third country", the hotel upgraded Lin's room from a standard room to a large suite with a living room kitchen.
这是一场完全在意料之外的旅程——由于疫情原因，受限于澳大利亚的入境禁令，她需要在第三国“隔离”14天后，才能入境澳洲。
It was an entirely unexpected journey - limited by Australia's entry ban, she had to be "quarantined" in a third country for 14 days before entering Australia.
林妍在澳大利亚国立大学念本科。
Lin Yan studied undergraduate studies at Australian National University.
南半球夏季的假期漫长，许多中国留学生会选择回到北半球的家乡过年。
Summer holidays in the southern hemisphere are long, and many Chinese students choose to return home to celebrate the New Year in the northern hemisphere.
林妍一放假就将在堪培拉租的公寓短租出去，回到了湖南老家。
On vacation, Lin rented apartments in Canberra and returned to his hometown in Hunan.
原计划是在国内实习，“想着回国还可以省一笔房租。
The plan was to have internships at home. "I thought I could save a lot of money by going home.
”一开始，她买的是1月21日赴澳的机票。
At first, she bought a ticket to Australia on January 21.
但由于该航班从武汉起飞，被取消。
However, the flight was cancelled due to its departure from Wuhan.
随后她又选择了2月1日在新加坡转机的机票，被航空公司告知，新加坡限制中国籍游客入境。
She then chose a flight to Singapore on February 1 and was told by airlines that Singapore restricted the entry of Chinese tourists.
手忙脚乱地改签了同一天从香港起飞的航班，没想到值机前又被拦下了。
He scrambled to sign a flight from Hong Kong the same day, only to be stopped before the plane was called.
无法登机的原因，是澳大利亚方面2月1日宣布的入境禁令——除了澳大利亚公民和永久居民及其直系亲属，从当天起禁止从中国大陆地区赴澳的所有旅客入境。
The reason for not being able to board the plane was the ban on entry announced by Australia on February 1, which bans all visitors to Australia from mainland China except Australian citizens and permanent residents and their immediate family members.
“这个政策是发出即执行的，我看到的时候已经在机场了。
"This policy is implemented immediately and I saw it already at the airport.
”林妍只能自认倒霉。
"Lin had to admit it.
次日，澳官方新闻发布会上，新闻发言人提出了一个看似折中的方案——中国籍游客在第三国待满14天便可入境，这个声明曾短暂地出现在澳洲卫生部的官网上。
The following day, at an official news conference, a spokesman for the Australian government offered what appeared to be a compromise - that Chinese tourists could enter Australia after 14 days in a third country - a statement that appeared briefly on the official website of the Australian Health Department.
此后，许多滞留国内的留学生开始通过“第三国隔离”的方法返校。
Since then, many students have returned to school through "third-country isolation."
但实际上，这个方法也并不保险。
In practice, however, this approach is not safe.
实在没有精力折腾了，林妍放弃了大多数“曲线返校”的留学生会选择的泰国等东南亚的落地签证国家，也没有选择费用相对低廉的俄、韩等周边国家，而是“转战”阿联酋。
With little energy left to toss, Lin has abandoned visa-on-arrival countries in Southeast Asia, such as Thailand, where most "back-to-school" students would choose, or the relatively inexpensive neighboring countries of Russia and South Korea, but the UAE.
“主要是签证问题，泰国落地签只有15天，担心澳洲政策有变，15天不够用，韩国需要提前办签证我也等不了，还是选择一个稳妥一些的国家吧。
"On the visa issue, Thailand landed only 15 days ago, worried about policy changes in Australia, 15 days is not enough, South Korea needs to get a visa ahead of time and I can't wait for a safer country.
”根据阿联酋的签证规定，持中国护照的公民因旅游、商务、探亲、过境等短期事由，在阿联酋停留不超过30天，即可免签。
According to the UAE visa regulations, citizens holding Chinese passports are exempted from visa requirements if they stay in the UAE for no more than 30 days for short-term reasons such as tourism, business, family visits or transit.
“我是半赌半猜，只想顺利回学校，没想到一个月内就把平时一年的机票都买了。
"I was half gambling half guess, just want to go back to school smoothly, did not expect a month on the usual one-year tickets to buy.
”除了机票价格次次高涨，以及“流落”第三国长达半月所需要多花费的旅行费用，林妍在堪培拉租的公寓也已经空置一个月，她依然需要支付高昂租金。
In addition to the second-highest ticket price and the extra travel costs of being "stranded" in a third country for half a month, Lin's Canberra-rented apartment has been vacant for a month and she still has to pay high rents.
“本来想省钱，没想到花的更多。
"I wanted to save money, but I didn't expect to spend more.
”直到现在，林妍早期买的那张新加坡中转悉尼的机票，由于新加坡航空公司拒绝退款，她很可能最终还要承受上万机票损失。
"So far, Lin's early ticket to Sydney via Singapore has probably ended up costing her tens of thousands of dollars in plane tickets because Singapore Airlines refused to refund her.
而这趟迫不得已的阿联酋半月游，林妍竟然还意外结识了同样选择在阿联酋“隔离”的校友。
And this last half-month trip to the United Arab Emirates, Lin Yin unexpectedly met alumni who also chose to "isolate" in the UAE.
她意识到，为了返校而在第三国飘荡半个月的留学生绝对不在少数。
She realized that there were not a few students who spent half a month in a third country to return to school.
林妍的曲折经历只是一个缩影。
Lin Yan's tortuous experience is just a miniature.
在希望正常返校的中国留学生群体中，澳洲留学生受疫情影响较大。
Among the Chinese students who wish to return to school normally, Australian students are more affected by the epidemic.
在国内疫情被世界卫生组织（WHO）宣布为突发公共卫生事件后，澳洲方面一系列朝令夕改的政策，让他们感到无奈。
After the outbreak was declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO), Australia's policy changes made them feel helpless.
该国官方曾表示，现在还没有设定一个时间表，延长禁令具体取决于疫情的情况。
Officials have said there is no timetable for extending the ban, which depends on the situation.
就在2月20日，澳方在此前延长一周的基础上，宣布将旅行禁令再延长一周。
Just on 20 February, the Australian side extended the travel ban for another week, building on the previous one-week extension.
目前，“第三国隔离14天”作为没有完全明确却是唯一可行的方式，成为大多数滞留国内的留学生首选，甚至有旅行社已经推出“14天，13夜”旅行套餐，用比较优惠的价格安排留学生在第三国的“漂流”。
At present, 14 days of isolation in a third country is the only way for students to stay in China. Some travel agencies have even launched a "14-day, 13-night" package, which allows students to travel to third countries at more favourable prices.
“我只想回去上学。
"I just want to go back to school.
”在相关的微博话题下，许多在第三国“隔离”等待入境澳洲的留学生这样写道。
On related microblogging topics, many students waiting to enter Australia in "isolation" in third countries wrote.
封城之内湖北之外的大部分留学生，在留学国家没有完全禁止入境的情况下，还能寻求各种方式“曲线返校”，但滞留在湖北的留学生，面临的未来仍不可知。
Most students from outside Hubei province can still find ways to "curve back to school" in the absence of a complete ban on entry, but the future of those studying in Hubei remains uncertain.
小萱已经在武汉隔离了28天，她是墨尔本皇家理工大学的预科生。
Ms Xuan, a premed student at Melbourne's Royal Polytechnic University, has been isolated in Wuhan for 28 days.
原定上课时间是2月3日，出于第三国隔离时间的问题，学校特地为中国学生调整了上课时间，延期到了3月2日。
The school, which was due to start on February 3, had to reschedule classes for Chinese students until March 2 because of isolation time in a third country.
但是，像小萱这样身在武汉的留学生，连到第三国隔离的机会都没有。
However, such as Xiaoxuan in Wuhan students, even to a third country isolated opportunities.
她不知道武汉什么时候能够恢复交通。
She wondered when Wuhan would be able to resume traffic.
“如果3月2日之前仍无法到校，学校会让我们休学半年到一年。
"If we don't get to school before March 2, the school will suspend us for six months to a year.
”和大多数留学生在意的问题一样，她在澳洲所租的房子，每个月房租加水电费用需要一万多元人民币。
Like most international students, the rent and utilities she rents in Australia cost more than 10,000 yuan a month.
如果继续无限期地等待，流水般浪费掉的各种在澳支出，让家境相对普通的留学生难以负担。
If we continue to wait indefinitely, the waste of all sorts of spending in Australia, relatively unaffordable for relatively ordinary foreign students.
英国留学生彤子已经缺课一个月。
An English student has been absent for a month.
在家多待一天，她的焦虑就加深一分。
One more day at home adds to her anxiety.
她自嘲道：“国内的学生无法返校都有网课安排，我们什么都没有，只能自己联系学校，然后反复绝望。
"Students at home are unable to go back to school with online classes," she said to herself. "We have nothing but to contact the school ourselves and despair again and again.
”她所在学校，只有数学、微积分这样大课有视频可看，而大多数核心专业课程并未提供线上教学。
At her school, there were videos for big classes such as math and calculus, while most core majors did not offer online instruction.
即便大课的录屏教学，也“只能看到老师的PPT，看不清老师写的计算过程”。
Even if the big class video teaching, also "can only see the teacher's PPT, can not see the teacher wrote the calculation process."
“我真的不想留级啊。
"I really don't want to repeat it.
”彤子无数次跟朋友诉苦。
He has complained to his friends countless times.
也有焦虑多天，终于看到一点点曙光的人。
There are also anxious days, and finally see a little bit of light.
2月19日，在瑞典读研面临毕设问题的武汉人南栀收到了母校邮件，表示可以帮她无限期延长毕业设计作品交付时间。
On February 19, Wuhan-based Nanzhi, who is studying in Sweden and is facing problems with her graduation project, received an e-mail from her alma mater saying she could extend her graduation project delivery time indefinitely.
她原定2月10日回校，自从武汉封城以来，毕业设计的问题让她焦虑了快一个月。
She was scheduled to return to school on February 10, and problems with her graduation project have worried her for nearly a month since the city was closed.
“我的毕业作品与日本一家高校已经签了合同，瑞典和日本的学校都提供了资金支持，如果无法回校，不仅影响毕业，合同的履行也会出问题，可能会有法律纠纷，也会导致个人信誉受损。
"I have signed a contract with a Japanese university for my graduation, and schools in Sweden and Japan have provided financial support. Failure to go back to school will not only affect graduation, but will also cause problems in the performance of contracts, possible legal disputes and damage to personal reputation.
”近一个月来，她不断与学校沟通，但由于无法告知学校具体返校时间，学校亦难以给出明确答复。
She has been communicating with schools for nearly a month but was unable to give a clear answer because she could not tell them when to go back to school.
因此，当得到学校告知“可以无限期延迟，只要你保证身体健康”的邮件，南栀悬了一个月的心终于轻轻落了地。
Therefore, when told by the school "can be postponed indefinitely, as long as you ensure good health" email, Gardenia hung for a month's heart finally dropped.
然而，并不是所有学校都能给出这样的承诺。
However, not all schools are able to make such a commitment.
同样面临毕业的加拿大留学生张翔，正因为签证问题不知所措。
Zhang Xiang, a Canadian student who also faces graduation, is at a loss over a visa.
张翔所持的学生签证3月底到期，“本来是准备回来过个年，1月29日就回去申工作签。
Zhang Xiang's student visa expired at the end of March. "I was supposed to be back for a year and went back on January 29 to apply for a work visa.
如果不能赶在签证到期之前返回加拿大，就需要在国内重新申请新的签证，一套流程下来，至少三个月后才能入境。
If it is not possible to return to Canada before the expiry of the visa, a new visa will need to be reapplied for domestically, a process that will take at least three months to enter Canada.
”最让他心痛的是，年前在加拿大定下来的工作岗位，由于无法到岗已经泡汤。
What pained him most was the fact that the jobs he had secured in Canada a year earlier had been ruined by the impossibility of reaching them.
“工作没了，房租还在交，一个月1500刀，还有一堆事情没办法处理。
"There's no work, rent is still paid, 1,500 knives a month, and a lot of work to do.
”张翔想到毕业前面临的一团乱麻，很头大。
Zhang Xiang thought of the tangles he had faced before graduation.
申请情况不算悲观疫情暴发以来，雅思率先取消了今年1月到3月中国大陆地区考试，托福、GRE也取消了大陆地区2月份的考试。
Since the outbreak of pessimism, the IELTS has taken the lead in cancelling tests in mainland China from January to March, and TOEFL and GRE canceled the February test in mainland China.
对于准备出国的学生而言，考试一再取消，很可能直接影响留学计划。
Repeated cancellations of exams are likely to have a direct impact on the student's plans to study abroad.
相比之下，公派留学人员的派出、延期措施较有保障。
By contrast, the sending and postponing measures are more secure.
据新华社报道，国家留学基金管理委员会表示，对于留学资格有效期在2020年6月30日以前的国家公派留学人员，如因疫情不能按原计划派出，需申请延期派出、变更留学单位或国别、放弃公派留学资格的，予以支持。
According to Xinhua News Agency, the management committee of the National Fund for Study Abroad said that those sent to foreign countries before June 30, 2020 who are unable to send students according to the original plan because of the epidemic situation, should apply for postponement or change of study unit or country, and give up their qualifications for study abroad.
因疫情申请放弃公派留学资格的，不受两年内不能申报国家公派留学的限制。
The application for renunciation of the qualification for study in public schools due to epidemic situation shall not be subject to the two-year limit.
不过，目前为止，暂时没有国外高校声明今年夏季不接收来自中国“疫区”的新生。
So far, however, no foreign colleges and universities have announced that they will not accept new students from affected areas in China this summer.
即便如此，许多人仍关心，因新冠肺炎疫情，多国采取暂发签证、取消相关航班等措施一再延续，是否会间接影响中国公民留学计划？某留学机构中介资深留学顾问舒原告诉中国新闻周刊，如果根据17年前SARS疫情过后的经验，其实对于留学影响并不大。
Even so, many people are still concerned that repeated measures such as temporary visa issuance and cancellation of flights due to the new crown pneumonia may indirectly affect China's citizens studying abroad program.
“虽然当年中国留学生的规模远不如现在，但英美澳加这些主要的留学大国，在对中国地区的招生上跟往年并没有太大区别。
"Although Chinese students were much smaller than they are now, the big overseas countries such as Anglo-American Australia and Canada are not so different in their enrollment in China as in previous years.
”对于招生有限的主要原因在于，此时准备申请出国留学的学生，一般是下一年才能完全完成申请。
The main reason for the limited enrolment is that students preparing to apply to study abroad at this time generally do not complete their applications until the next year.
“现在看来，疫情对于下一年留学的影响，还没有那么悲观。
"The impact of the epidemic on studying abroad next year is not so pessimistic," he said.
”舒原表示。
Mr Shuyuan said.
至于许多网友关心的一个问题：湖北籍学生在申请学校过程中，是否可能受到歧视甚至被拒？舒原肯定地说，不会的。
As for a question many netizens are concerned about: Are Hubei students likely to be discriminated against or even rejected in the process of applying for school?
“其实参照非典期间的情况，很多问题都会有答案。
"There are a lot of questions that will have to be answered," he said.
前提是疫情能够尽快控制住。
The premise is that the outbreak can be contained soon.
”而对于大量中国留学生入境留学国家的不确定性，存在忧虑的不仅是留学生群体。
It is not just the international student community that worries about the uncertainty surrounding the entry of large numbers of Chinese students to study abroad.
根据英国《卫报》报道，有悉尼大学的讲师曾表示，学校聘用兼职教师的数量要视学生注册数量而定，如果出现学生取消课程的情况，兼职教师人数也必然相应减少。
According to The Guardian, a lecturer at the University of Sydney said the number of part-time teachers in the schools depends on the number of students enrolled, and that if students cancel their courses, the number of part-time teachers is bound to decrease accordingly.
如果入境禁令一再延长，缴纳高昂学费的学生只能在家上网课，也会间接影响下一年的招生。
If the ban on entry is extended again and again, students who pay exorbitant fees will have to take classes online at home, indirectly affecting enrolment the following year.
无论是留学生还是校方，都在极力避免疫情带来的一系列不良影响。
Both the international students and the university are trying to avoid a series of adverse effects of the epidemic.
但他们都清楚，解决所有问题的根本，还在于疫情控制，春天真正到来。
But they all know that the root of all the problems lies in the containment of the epidemic and the arrival of spring.
