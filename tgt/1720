作者 | 唐亚华编辑 | 魏佳疫情下的健身行业，正在经历冰火两重天。
AT & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
一边是月成本2000万、现金流撑不过50天的线下门店在生死边缘挣扎，另一边是巨大的健身需求带动纯线上公司日活、营收翻番，还有一些成本相对可控的品牌，选择用直播课等形式维护用户、宣传品牌，教练也开始尝试当起网红。
On the one hand, off-line stores with monthly costs of 20 million and cash flow of less than 50 days are struggling to survive, while on the other, huge demand for fitness drives companies to double their daily lives, double their revenues, and some more cost-effective brands to maintain and promote their users and brands in the form of live broadcast classes.
突如其来的疫情让2019年原本就进入洗牌期的健身行业雪上加霜，加速优胜劣汰与重塑行业格局已是定局。
The sudden outbreak of the disease in 2019 is already entering a period of shuffling fitness industry, to speed up the fittest and reshape the industry pattern is a foregone conclusion.
多位行业内人士表示，疫情面前首先考验的是各家的现金流储备，这时候现金流不足的企业要想尽一切办法活下去，而情况乐观的企业应该趁势进攻，整合优质教练资源、占据优势点位将会比平时更容易。
The first test of the epidemic, say industry insiders, is cash-flow reserves, when cash-strapped companies want to survive by all means, while upbeat companies should take advantage of the situation and consolidate quality coaching resources and position themselves more easily than usual.
对于急速爆发的线上直播等业态，更多受访者认为这会成为一种有效的引流宣传手段，而不会是主流服务模式和有效的商业模式。
More respondents said it would be an effective way to promote streaming rather than a mainstream service model or an effective business model.
因为不管何种方式做线上尝试，都是一个继续投入的过程，而大部分直播都是免费或是低收费，短期来看对正向现金流的帮助并不明显。
Because trying to do it online, by any means, is a continuous process, and most live broadcasts are free or low-cost, and in the short term the help to positive cash flow is not obvious.
但疫情之后，线上线下的结合会形成新的竞争力，从业者也将面临新挑战。
But in the wake of the epidemic, the combination of offline and offline will create new competitiveness and new challenges for practitioners.
门店迎生死大考“月成本2000万，现金流最多撑50天”曾经拥有75家线下健身房的高炎最近很焦虑。
Store-to-life exams "cost 20 million a month, cash flow stays at a maximum of 50 days." High fever, which used to have 75 out-of-line gyms, has been a worry lately.
他从业20余年，是连锁健身俱乐部黄金时代创始人兼CEO。
He worked for more than 20 years as the founder and CEO of the chain health club Golden Age.
鼎盛时期，黄金时代的75家店中，面积2000-3000平米、带游泳池的占到60%以上，主要分布在河南、江苏等省份。
In the heyday, of the 75 shops in the Golden Age, those with swimming pools accounted for more than 60 percent, mainly located in Henan and Jiangsu provinces.
2019年，传统健身房遭遇倒闭潮，黄金时代也因业绩下滑超20%，优化关闭了20多家店。
In 2019, traditional gyms failed, and the Golden Age closed more than 20%, thanks to a 20% decline in performance.
按照高炎原本的规划，对人员、店面、业务优化之后，预计2020年业绩能有较好的回升，但突发的疫情让他措手不及。
According to Gao Yan's original plan, the personnel, storefront, business optimization, the 2020 performance is expected to have a better recovery, but he was caught unprepared by the outbreak.
“我五六十岁了，从来没遇到过如此大规模的事件，起码有两个月几乎整个国家的造血机器陷于停滞，这对中国经济来说也算一场重感冒了。
"I'm 50 or 60, I've never had an event of this magnitude, and for at least two months almost the entire country's hematopoietic machine has stalled, making it a terrible cold for the Chinese economy.
”高炎感慨。
"Gao Yan feeling.
他给燃财经介绍了公司的成本结构，员工最多时有2800多名，目前剩1800多名，整个公司人工成本约占45%，房租占15%-20%，毛利率在20%以下，每个月的硬性成本高达2000多万。
He described the company's cost structure, with more than 2,800 employees at its peak, more than 1,800 employees, about 45% of the company's labor costs, 15% to 20% rent, and a gross interest rate of less than 20%, with a monthly hard cost of more than 20 million.
如果在完全没有收入的情况下，最多能撑50天。
If there is no income at all, it can last up to 50 days.
“很多大咖说企业要留够3个月的现金流，我觉得这是‘饱汉不知饿汉饥’，民营企业能有超过3个月现金流的可能不会超过1%，今年预计还要收缩约10%的业务。
"A lot of big curses say companies have to save up to three months of cash flow, and I think it's' hungry and hungry, 'with private businesses likely to have no more than 1% cash flow for more than three months and are expected to shrink by about 10% this year.
”疫情之下，很多线下业态都在转向线上，黄金时代也在开展线上直播课程，每天上3-4节课，近半个月有10-20万次浏览，吸引到新用户约3000人。
Under the epidemic, much of the offline business is turning online, and the golden age is offering live online courses, with 3-4 sessions a day and 100,000-200,000 views in the last half-month, attracting about 3,000 new users.
“线上课程给会员和员工都吃了一颗定心丸，但绝大多数企业做线上，目前还停留在客户维护、品牌宣传阶段，营销和销售是两个概念，营销要转变成真正的销售还需要时间。
"Online courses are a reassuring experience for members and employees, but most businesses are still on the line, at the stage of customer maintenance, brand promotion, marketing and sales are two concepts that will take time for marketing to translate into real sales.
”高炎表示。
"Gao Yan said.
在这种形势下，高炎还在探索其他的自救方法。
In this situation, Gao Yan is still exploring other self-help methods.
他一方面在协调房租减免事宜，另一方面也在呼吁有关部门关注健身行业水电气暖的收费标准。
While he is coordinating rent relief, he is also calling on authorities to pay attention to the fitness industry's water, gas and heating rates.
图 / 视觉中国“在用水用电上，我们被算在特殊服务用水里，和洗浴中心等高档消费在一档，比普通商业用水高出200%多，我们60%的店面都有游泳池，成本非常高。
Photo / Vision China "In terms of water use, we are counted in special service water, and high-end consumption such as bathing centres, which is more than 200% higher than ordinary commercial water.
”高炎认为，这对健身行业不太公平，希望能在水和燃料费上享受和普通企业一样的标准，同时给予适当的补贴支持。
Gao believes this is not fair to the fitness industry and wants to enjoy the same standards for water and fuel costs as ordinary businesses, backed by appropriate subsidies.
至于人事方面，高炎对员工很有信心。
As for the personnel aspect, Gao Yan has the confidence to the staff.
“1998年亚洲金融危机时，我在经营一家外贸企业，当时人员流失比较多，留下来的员工主动要求降薪，现在回想起来，那么大的危机度过了，我相信现在也可以，”高炎说，“我们经营22年了，员工里有10%-20%是曾经的会员，中高层300多人都持有股份，我相信员工能和我们站在一起共度难关。
"When I was running a foreign trade company during the 1998 Asian financial crisis, and the workers who stayed behind voluntarily asked for a pay cut, in retrospect, that big crisis has passed," Gao said. "We have been in business for 22 years, 10% to 20% of our staff are former members and more than 300 people own shares.
当然，公司挺过来了不会亏欠任何一个人。
Of course, the company survived without a debt to anyone.
”据中体数据总经理、光猪圈健身联合创始人兼CEO刘易斯观察，春节之前，身边的同行还比较乐观，有一部分人认为，非典结束后健身行业迎来爆发，这次应该也有机会。
Lewis, general manager of Body Data and co-founder and CEO of the Guangxi Pig Circle, observed that colleagues around the Spring Festival were optimistic, with some saying the post-SARS outbreak should also be an opportunity.
但随着确诊病例逐渐增加，从业者们经历了从乐观到相对乐观，再到悲观的转变。
But as confirmed cases have increased, practitioners have gone from optimism to relative optimism to pessimism.
不过，最近上层复工意图明显，健身产业很可能会提前恢复。
Recently, however, the intention to resume upper-class work is clear, fitness industry is likely to recover early.
他认为，2019年健身行业本来就有一波洗牌，大约15%的门店因为过度竞争、经营不善而倒闭，这一波打击下，可能还会有20%的企业挺不住。
In 2019, he believes, the fitness industry will have a wave of shuffling, with about 15% of stores failing because of excessive competition and mismanagement, and 20% more likely to fail.
“即使3月能逐渐复工，人员密集的健身房恢复也可能要到4月。
"Even if work resumes gradually in March, the staff-intensive gyms could resume in April.
但如果再往后推迟一个月，很多店的现金流就断了。
But if you put off for another month, the cash flow of many stores is off.
湖北省预计6月份之前都不能正常经营，门店倒闭的现象会更多。
Hubei province is not expected to operate normally until June, and there will be more shop failures.
”刘易斯表示。
"said Lewis.
纯线上业务爆发“日活营收均翻番，日新增4-5万用户”用户的时间是一定的，线下的暂时封锁让部分线上健身业态迎来爆发。
On-line business erupts "daily live income doubles, the daily addition of 40-50,000 users" user time is certain, the off-line temporary closure of part of the fitness industry ushered in an explosion.
“疫情以来，我们的日活用户从之前的20多万涨到了最高时的57万，以前很多沉默用户也被唤醒，平均每天新增4-5万用户，最高峰时新增7-8万，营收也翻番了。
"Since the outbreak, our daily subscriber population has risen from more than 200,000 to a peak of 570,000, and previously many silent users have been woken up, adding an average of 40,000 to 50,000 new users a day, adding 70,000 to 80,000 at peak times and doubling revenue.
”Wake创始人兼CEO熊明俊告诉燃财经。
Wake founder and CEO Xiong Mingjun told Flaming Finance.
Wake是一家线上瑜伽生态平台，最早做瑜伽知识付费课程，2019年7月，公司招募城市合伙人，增加了B2B2C模式，用内容赋能瑜伽馆。
Wake is an online yoga eco-platform and was one of the first to do yoga pay-for-knowledge courses. In July 2019, the company recruited urban partners, added a B2B2C model and used content-enabling yoga halls.
通俗来讲，Wake将平台上的课程包打包成年卡，卖给用户和城市合伙人，城市合伙人再卖给瑜伽馆和C端用户，城市合伙人的模式之下又有层层激励的推广变现机制。
In layman's terms, Wake packages adult cards from the platform and sells them to users and city partners, who in turn sell them to yoga studios and C-end users, with layers of incentive and cash-for-action mechanisms under the urban partner model.
熊明俊介绍，Wake的变现场景有两个。
There are two realisation scenarios for Wake, Xiong said.
一个是线上家庭瑜伽教学，老师通过App完成线上社群瑜伽打卡答疑，视频互动教学；一个是线下实体瑜伽馆双师教学。
One is online home yoga teaching, teachers through App to complete online community yoga card printing, video interactive teaching; one is online physical yoga studio teaching.
上课内容用Wake APP里的课程投屏播放，瑜伽馆保留一到两个老师在现场指导，没办法天天去瑜伽馆的学员购卡后也可以跟着APP内容在家做瑜伽。
The content of the class is shown on the Wake APP, and the yoga studio keeps one or two teachers on the spot, unable to go daily to the yoga studio after the students can do yoga with APP content at home.
图 /视觉中国这样的模式对于瑜伽馆老板来说，降低了师资成本，还能赚一笔出售线上会员卡的钱。
A model like Picture / Vision China reduces the cost of teaching for a yoga studio owner and can earn money selling an online membership card.
推出这一模式后，Wake触达了以前纯线上业务很难触达的三四线城市。
With the launch of this model, Wake has reached three or four-lane cities that were previously inaccessible to pure line business.
疫情发生后，大部分瑜伽馆暂时关停了，在家做瑜伽的需求剧增。
After the outbreak, most yoga studios were temporarily closed, and the need for yoga at home increased dramatically.
在他看来，这次疫情让很多用户的健康意识包括对瑜伽的理念推进了3-5年的时间，“对我们来说是一个利好，短期数据表现很好之外，资本市场抛来橄榄枝。
In his view, the epidemic has pushed the health awareness of many users, including the idea of yoga, forward for three to five years. "It's good for us, short-term data is good," he said.
”他预计，健身行业整体线下恢复应该在六七月份，现在这段时间是他认为要抓住的红利期，“目前公司全员都是配合移动办公，下一步的规划是完成新的数据积累、业务变现以及新一轮融资。
He expects the overall off-line recovery in the fitness industry to take place in June and July, a dividend period he believes he wants to capture. "The company is now fully mobile and the next step is to complete new data accumulation, liquidity and a new round of funding."
”开线上直播课自救教练转型当网红疫情除了让大型门店型健身房饱受打击、让线上模式迎来新机之外，还有中间地带。
"Turning to live streaming lessons as a self-help coach, there's the middle ground, in addition to the big store gyms that have been hammered and the new online model.
一些门店成本相对可控，但同样受到影响的企业正在通过直播健身、推出线上私教课等方式自救，一些教练尝试着当起网红。
Some stores are relatively affordable, but similarly affected businesses are trying to save themselves by broadcasting live fitness and offering online private classes, and some coaches are trying to be net winners.
据燃财经整理，目前Keep、超级猩猩、乐刻等互联网健身品牌的线下门店均暂时关闭，但各家都推出了线上直播课、训练营等线上业务。
Under-the-line health brands such as Keep, Super Gorilla and Le Carver have been shut down temporarily, but companies are offering live online classes, training camps and so on.
乐刻方面表示，公司在抖音和快手上均上传了大量视频，截至2月11晚，乐刻做了39节直播课程，全平台观看量突破110万。
Le Carver said it had uploaded a large number of videos on both the chattering and fast hands, and as of the night of February 11, Le Carver had conducted 39 live courses, with more than 1.1 million views across the platform.
“我们没有预付费机制，而且去年已经实现了盈利，现金流也比较充足，短期来看，疫情将对我们门店的客流量、营收产生影响，但有观点认为疫情结束后，健身场馆将迎来一波健身热潮，我们对未来健身市场持乐观态度。
"We don't have a prepaid system, we've made a profit last year and we have ample cash flow. In the short term, the epidemic will have an impact on the traffic and revenue of our stores.
”乐刻相关负责人告诉燃财经。
Those responsible for engraving told Flaming Finance.
Keep聚焦平台方式，联合趁早App、Shape塑健身、每日瑜伽App 、lululemon及多位健身达人推出“假期运动直播大全”。
Keep focuses on the platform approach, combining early App, Shape Fitness, Daily Yoga App, Lululemon, and a number of fitness gurus to launch the "Live Holiday Campaign."
从数据来看，取得了比较大的关注度，累计参与人数超过5千万，累计直播时常达到100小时，在线人数峰值为16万人。
From the data point of view, more attention has been given to the cumulative number of participants over 50 million, the cumulative live broadcast often reaches 100 hours, the peak number of online people is 160,000.
“我们联合多家品牌的出发点是帮用户尽可能提供比较全的服务，目前是社会价值类项目，下一步直播会不会成为常态并且纳入商业化，还要去调研。
"Our starting point for joining multiple brands is to help users provide as full a range of services as possible. It is currently a social value project. Will the next live broadcast become the norm and become part of commercialization?
”Keep公关负责人李若名对燃财经表示。
Mr Lee, Keep's head of public relations, told Financial.
超级猩猩则推出了付费课程，“超猩家里蹲”过年期间的直播实时在线接近30万人，在一直播平台上热度排名第一；到2月10日，超级猩猩发布了付费课程产品“超猩家里蹲-14天‘陪’训营”，售价399元，已全部满员。
Super orangutans are offering paid courses, with nearly 300,000 live-time live-action live broadcasts from their homes during the Lunar New Year, ranking number one on a live broadcast platform. By February 10, super-gorillas had released a paid-up program called "Super Gorilla Home Squat-14 Day Training Camp," priced at 399 yuan.
按照每班上限30人、每人399元费用计算，约有26万余元收入。
Based on the upper limit of 30 persons per class at 399 yuan per person, there are about 260,000 yuan of income.
在刘易斯看来，行业内风险较大的是两类型公司。
In Lewis's view, the riskier ones in the industry are two types of companies.
一种是规模特别大的传统健身房，成本特别高，三个月没有收入公司就会倒闭，另一种类型是单店，房租、人力都很重的健身房，面临很大的问题。
One is a particularly large, traditional gym, which can go out of business after three months without an income, and the other is a single-store, heavily-rented, heavily staffed gym with big problems.
还有一些私教工作室，本身会员数就很低，短期内会员也不敢去健身房，再加上去年私教工作室已经开始行业洗牌，这一次对他们是双重打击。
There are also private tutoring studios, with low memberships and a short-term fear of going to the gym, and the fact that private tutoring studios began shuffling their business last year is a double whammy.
图 /视觉中国但是，像超级猩猩、乐刻、光猪圈健身这一类型，总体成本并不高，人力成本基本上也是采用合伙人制，底薪压力也不大，应对风险能力较强。
Picture / Vision China But, like super orangutans, carvings and pigsty fitness, the total cost is not high, the human cost is basically a partnership system, the base salary pressure is small, and the ability to cope with risks is high.
如光猪圈健身目前有直营店有14家，加盟店140多家，据他介绍，由于其单店面积较小，硬成本约几万元，相对可控，教练采用合伙人制，待遇根据业务浮动。
If Guang pig pen fitness there are 14 direct shops, more than 140 franchises, he said, because of its small size, hard costs about tens of thousands of yuan, relatively controllable, coaches use the partner system, treatment according to the business fluctuations.
最大压力在于后台成本，公司研发、技术等共有140多个人，加起来一个月支出有几百万。
The biggest pressure is on the back-office costs, the company's research and development, technology, and so on more than 140 people, add up to millions of a month's expenditure.
“线上尝试方面，一种是做线上活动，包括公益活动、大规模品牌性活动，目的是在向用户发声，加深会员的品牌意识，同时配合一些拉新手段，比如推荐客户可以赠卡；一种是教练转型去做网红；还有一种是针对教练的培训。
"On the online side, there are on-line activities, including public welfare activities, large-scale branding activities, that are aimed at raising the voice of users, deepening brand awareness among members, as well as providing new tools such as recommending customers to give cards, training coaches to become net winners and training coaches.
”他表示。
'he said.
他认为，做品牌活动是必要的，同时有适当的业务拓展也是合理的。
He believes that branding is necessary and that it is reasonable to have the right business expansion.
他举例，长沙的一家健身公司做了一场4小时的云蹦迪活动，里面做了一些减脂产品的预售，开放了南京、长沙各60个名额，到结束就全卖掉了，据说收益有50万左右。
For example, a fitness company in Changsha did a four-hour cloud bungee jumping event, which included some sales of fat-reducing products, opening Nanjing and Changsha to 60 places each.
但这种方式对一些私教课机构并不会有太大效果，而疫情下如“不健身病毒来了倒霉的就是你”之类的恐怖营销产生的则是负面效果。
But this approach will not have much effect on some private schools, and terrorist marketing such as "it's you who's unlucky not to get fit" has a negative effect.
综合来看，他认为这些线上动作最大的作用在于给客户传递一个心理上的支撑，告诉客户“我还很好，疫情结束后要关注自己的身体，回到我们的场馆里来锻炼”。
Taken together, he says the biggest effect of these online actions is to give customers a psychological boost, telling them, "I'm fine, I need to focus on my body and get back to work out in our stadiums after the epidemic."
加速优胜劣汰线上线下结合会是常态长期关注运动健身行业的投资人动域资本黄一帆认为，这一次疫情会加速健身行业优胜劣汰的过程，健身行业自2018年开始出现拐点，2019年则表现得更为明显，行业正在从野蛮生长转向去伪存真的过程中，这个过程会被疫情加速，原本已经在竞争中处于劣势的企业会雪上加霜。
Huang Yifan, an investor in the sports and fitness industry, thinks the epidemic will accelerate the fitness industry's fortunes, starting in 2018 and becoming more pronounced in 2019, as the industry moves from barbaric growth to de-falsification, a process that could be exacerbated by companies already at a competitive disadvantage.
具体来说，疫情对各企业的影响主要是现金流层面，每年春节后是健身行业全年现金流最好的时间点之一，一些重销售的机构3月份能冲出半年的销售业绩，对于这样机构，疫情产生的影响更为致命。
Specifically, the impact of the epidemic on companies is mainly cash flow, annual Spring Festival is one of the industry's best cash flow points of the year, some resale organizations can break out of the half-year sales results in March, the impact of the epidemic is more deadly.
但机遇和挑战总是并存，这次疫情也可能会为行业带来一些长期的正向影响。
But there are always both opportunities and challenges, and the epidemic is likely to have some long-term positive effects on the industry.
黄一帆提到，疫情之下很多健身品牌开始尝试以线上的方式服务用户，以跑步机为例的家庭运动器材获得的线上流量有明显的提升；运动女装品牌“暴走的萝莉”的流量表现也非常好。
Huang noted that many fitness brands are trying to serve users online under the epidemic, with a marked increase in online traffic to home sports equipment such as treadmills, and very good traffic to the sport-women's brand, Rowly Walking.
“这反映了无论是出于健康意识提升还是在家中的空闲时间增多的原因，一些原来没有健身习惯的新用户已经被激活甚至转化了，疫情之后这部分用户还有可能成为线下健身服务的消费者。
"This reflects the fact that some new users who were not in a fitness habit have been activated or even converted, whether as a result of increased health awareness or more free time at home, and are likely to become consumers of off-line fitness services after the outbreak.
所以从需求端来分析，长期会有利好，会有反弹。
So from the demand side of analysis, the long-term will be good, there will be a rebound.
”图 /视觉中国那么，转型线上就容易吗？黄一帆认为，线上服务并非是在疫情期间出现的新概念，过去的几年间一直有企业探索用线上方式服务用户，但仅依靠线上方式将一名小白用户教育成一个长期留存的健身用户的难度很大。
In the past few years, companies have been exploring online ways of serving users, but it has been very difficult to educate a small white user into a long-term fitness user by relying solely on the online approach.
疫情拉低了用户教育成本，在当前环境下，无论新老用户，只要有健身需求，线上服务几乎成为了唯一的选择。
The epidemic is lowering user education costs, and in the current environment, online services are almost the only option for both old and new users, as long as there is a need for fitness.
“目前这些探索了线上服务方式的品牌，都有意愿在疫情结束后把线上服务方式继续下去。
"These brands, which have explored ways of serving online, are willing to continue online service after the epidemic is over."
这其实是开辟了一个新的家庭场景为主的健身体验。
This is actually a new home-based fitness experience.
”不过，现在大部分直播都是免费的，线上私教与线上训练营等服务探索的收费也相对较低且以服务原有会员为主，短期来看不管何种方式做线上尝试，这反而是一个继续投入的过程，对正向现金流的帮助并不明显。
But most live broadcasts are now free, and services such as online tutoring and on-line training camps are relatively cheap and service-oriented, and in the short term, regardless of how you try to do it online, it's a continuous process that doesn't help much with positive cash flows.
但在他看来，线上的探索带来了老用户互动与新用户获客，品牌塑造和长期价值的好机会，会清晰地反映在疫情结束后品牌表现出的“后劲”上。
But, in his view, online exploration offers an opportunity for old users to interact with new customers, brand building, and long-term value, which is clearly reflected in the brand's "afterthought" after the epidemic ends.
“这个时候现金储备充足的公司是积蓄力量准备加快发展的好机会，由于疫情造成的行业加速调整，一批优秀教练与优质商业地产位置可能被释放出来，对现金储备充足、竞争力强的品牌的后续扩张也会有利。
"Companies with ample cash reserves are a good time to build up the strength to accelerate growth," he said. "A number of good coaches and high-quality commercial real estate positions could be freed up as a result of the epidemic, as well as the subsequent expansion of highly competitive brands with sufficient cash reserves."
”黄一帆说。
"said Huang Yifan.
在刘易斯看来，这场疫情让以前很多不关注甚至抗拒线上的经营者，开始意识到线上的重要性，而且很多人会发现完整的体系对抗风险的能力大于单体，“疫情结束后，中国的健身产业可能会有一波整合，有的倒闭，有得归入一些大品牌下面，马太效应更强。
According to Lewis, the epidemic has made many operators who previously paid little attention to or even resisted online begin to realize their online importance, and many will find the whole system more risk-resistant than monolithic. "After the epidemic ends, China's fitness industry may see a wave of consolidation, with some collapsing and others falling under big brands, with a stronger Matthew effect.
”更多人关心的是，火热的线上模式会成为主流还是昙花一现？黄一帆认为，疫情结束后，线上部分不会成为主流的服务形式，而更可能成为线下服务的补充或是形成线上线下结合的综合服务方式。
More people are concerned about whether the hot online model will become mainstream or ephemeral? Mr Huang thinks the online sector will not become a mainstream form of service after the epidemic ends, but more likely to be a complement to offline services or a form of integrated off-line integration.
比如，原来每个月来线下上6次课，可能会变成2节线上课、4节线下课再结合自主训练打卡的新形式。
For example, six classes a month may turn into two classes, four periods off and a new form of card printing with self-training.
未来线上线下结合会形成新的竞争力，也对从业者提出更多挑战。
Future offline integration will create new competitiveness and pose additional challenges for practitioners.
