美国约翰斯•霍普金斯大学统计显示，截至当地时间21日13时，美国新冠肺炎确诊病例已超过2万例，死亡278例。
By 1300 hours local time, more than 20,000 cases and 278 deaths had been confirmed in the United States, according to Johns Hopkins University.
三天之内，全美确诊病例从1万例增至2万例。
Within three days, the number of confirmed cases increased from 10,000 to 20,000 nationwide.
而更有研究分析，美国疫情的峰值最早可能要到5月份才能到来。
More analytically, the peak of the epidemic in the United States may not be reached until May at the earliest.
美国确诊病例数破两万48小时内确诊数据翻番确诊22043，死亡278，这是截至美东时间3月21日13时，约翰斯•霍普金斯大学更新的美国最新疫情数据。
The number of confirmed cases in the United States doubled within 24, 48 hours, confirmed 22043 and 278, the latest U. S. outbreak data updated by Johns Hopkins University as of 13: 00 AM ET.
从最近一周的数据发展来看，疫情无疑已在美国呈暴发之势。
Judging by recent week's data developments, the epidemic is certainly on the rise in the United States.
当地时间3月13日，在美国确诊首例新冠肺炎病例52天后，特朗普宣布“国家紧急状态”。
Trump declared a "state of emergency" on March 13, 52 days after the first case of pneumonia was confirmed in the United States.
这被外界视为美国在国家层面正视疫情、加强防控的开始。
This is seen as the beginning of the United States at the national level to face the epidemic and strengthen prevention and control.
当天，美国累计确诊病例数为1701例。
On that day, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in the United States was 1701.
5天之后的18日，这一数字逼近1万。
Five days later, on the 18th, that number was close to 10,000.
当地时间18日22时，美国确诊病例达9077例。
At 2200 local time on the 18th, 9,077 cases were confirmed in the United States.
而到20日18时30分，美国确诊病例已超1.8万例。
By 1830 hours on the 20th, more than 18,000 cases had been confirmed in the United States.
不到48个小时，确诊病例数翻番。
In less than 48 hours, the number of confirmed cases doubled.
数字飙升的背后，美国疫情快速蔓延的趋势更令人担忧。
Behind the surge, the rapid spread of the epidemic in the United States is even more worrying.
《纽约时报》20日报道，哥伦比亚大学的研究人员通过数学模型对美国疫情发展进行了预测。
Researchers at Columbia University used mathematical models to predict the spread of the epidemic in the United States, The New York Times reported on the 20th.
研究显示，目前美国疫情仅处于起步阶段，峰值最早也要到5月份才能到来。
Studies show that the U. S. epidemic is only in its infancy, with peaks due in May at the earliest.
研究称，如果“完全不加控制”，峰值日新增病例可达到50万；如果采取部分控制措施，峰值日新增也将接近30万；如果采取最严的控制措施，则能有效平滑感染人数的增长曲线，但这些措施必须在全国范围内马上施行。
If "completely uncontrolled," the study says, half a million new cases could be added to the peak day, and close to 300,000 if partial controls are put in place, and that the steepest controls would effectively smooth the growth curve for the number of people infected, but only if they are implemented immediately across the country.
当地时间3月18日，美国纽约州拿骚县的一处医疗中心户外停车场正在进行免下车新冠病毒检测，医务人员工作交流。
An outdoor parking lot in Nassau County, New York, was tested for the new crown virus and medical staff were working together, local time said.
目前，纽约州有部分地点推行免下车新冠病毒检测，该测试需要通过预约评估方可到现场检测。
At present, some locations in New York State to implement the new crown virus free test, the test needs to pass the appointment assessment before on-site testing.
中新社记者 廖攀 摄准备就绪，还是措手不及？美国防控举措的“被动升级”“新冠病毒会奇迹般地消失”“新冠病毒是民主党的新骗局”“不管发生什么，我们都做好了准备”……2月底，特朗普在公开讲话中这样判断美国的疫情。
"The New Crown Virus is the new Democratic deceit" "No matter what happens, we are ready..." Trump said in a public speech at the end of February, judging the US epidemic.
然而，事实证明，当时的特朗普显然过于乐观，他所领导的美国似乎也没有做好应对疫情的准备。
Yet, as it turned out, Trump was clearly overly optimistic, and his country did not seem ready to deal with the epidemic.
3月以来，无论是让巴菲特都“活久见”金融市场持续动荡，还是超市里连卫生纸都买断货的抢购大军，美国社会的恐慌情绪越来越浓。
Since March, the fear in American society has grown, whether it is the constant turmoil in financial markets that has kept Buffett alive, or the rush to buy toilet paper in supermarkets.
疫情蔓延、民众恐慌，政府方面的疫情防控举措也在被动中不断加码。
The spread of the epidemic, public panic, the government side of the epidemic prevention and control initiatives in the passive constantly increasing.
从出台“15天抗疫指引”建议避免10人以上聚会，到多州宣布“居家令”；从暂停同欧洲多国旅行往来，到暂停在全球所有常规签证服务，“暂停”渐渐成为美国政令中的关键词。
From the 15-day anti-epidemic guidelines, which recommend avoiding more than 10-person gatherings to multi-state declarations of "stay-at-home" orders, from suspending multi-country travel to Europe to all regular visa services around the world, the "moratorium" has become a key word in US policy.
最新的动作是，3月21日，美国正式关闭南北边境，除贸易往来外，与加拿大、墨西哥接壤的边境限制人员流动。
In the latest move, on March 21, the United States formally closed its North-South border, restricting the movement of people along its borders with Canada and Mexico, in addition to trade.
当前，美国过半数的州宣布进入紧急状态，逾五分之一美国人因“居家令”而要隔离在家。
More than half of the states have declared a state of emergency and more than one-fifth of Americans are being kept in isolation because of "home orders."
但舆论认为，从上到下，美国的防控举措原本可以更早些、更快些。
But public opinion suggests that, from top to bottom, America's control efforts could have been earlier and faster.
美国《华盛顿邮报》日前以“总统先生，请把我们关起来”为题发表评论文章，表达对美国政府防控不力的不满。
"Mr. President, please lock us up," the Washington Post said in a commentary expressing dissatisfaction with the government's lack of control.
文章指出，疫情期间，各州政府积极采取“自救”措施，严格控制学校、公共交通等公众聚集；与之相反的是，美国联邦政府却反应迟缓。
The article points out that during the epidemic, state governments actively took "self-help" measures, strictly controlling public gatherings such as schools and public transportation; in contrast, the US federal government was slow to respond.
就在20日，特朗普还表示，他不认为发布全美范围的“居家令”有必要，因为一些地区疫情并不严重。
On the 20th, Trump also said he did not think it was necessary to issue a nationwide "home order," because some areas were not seriously affected.

中新社记者 廖攀 摄“震中”纽约告急州长、市长轮番求援防控措手不及，最明显的表现就是，即便是在全世界最发达的美国，物资也在“告急”。
NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York's governor and mayor have been caught off guard by a wave of rescue efforts, most notably in the world's most developed country, the United States.
情况最严重的是纽约州。
The worst situation is in New York State.
在当前全美确诊病例中，纽约州病例占40%以上。
New York State accounts for more than 40 per cent of confirmed cases in the United States.
20日，特朗普宣布纽约州出现“重大灾难”，命令联邦政府支援该州抗击新冠肺炎疫情。
On the 20th, Trump declared a "major disaster" for New York, ordering the federal government to support the state in fighting the outbreak.
美媒称，这是美国总统首次因公共卫生安全事件宣布重大灾区。
It was the first time a U.S. president had declared a major disaster area because of a public health security incident.
纽约州的情况有多急迫？州长科莫在20日直接对外界宣称，任何商业公司有条件生产口罩、手套等相关医学防护用品，州政府都将出高价购买。
Governor James Comer told reporters Monday that the state government will pay a high price for any commercial company that is in a position to make medical supplies such as masks and gloves.
纽约市长白思豪不仅将纽约称作美国疫情的“震中”，更是列出了一长串急需物资清单：到4月初，纽约市将需要300万个N95口罩、5000万个外科口罩、1.5万个呼吸器，以及2500万件手术服、工作服、手套和口罩。
Not only did New York City's governor call New York the epicenter of the epidemic, but it also drew up a long list of urgently needed supplies: by early April, New York City would need three million N95 masks, 50 million surgical masks, 15,000 respirators, and 25 million surgical suits, coveralls, gloves, and masks.
不仅纽约，疫情面前，全美的医用物资都存巨大缺口。
Not just in New York, but in the United States, there is a huge gap in medical supplies.
美国卫生与公共服务部3月初曾表示，美国的国家药品和医疗用品紧急储备只有大约1200万个N95口罩和3000万个外科口罩，仅占发生大流行情况下所需口罩数量的1.2%。
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in early March that the nation's national emergency stockpile of medicines and medical supplies consisted of only about 12 million N95 masks and 30 million surgical masks, or only 1.2 per cent of the number of masks needed in a pandemic.
为应对物资告急，自称“战时总统”的特朗普在3月18日称，会立即启动“国防生产法”。
In response to the crisis, Trump, a self-styled "wartime president," said on March 18 that he would immediately launch a "defense production law."
当地时间3月17日，美国旧金山湾区圣马特奥县一家超市的多种商品供不应求。
A supermarket in San Mateo County, San Francisco Bay, is in short supply March 17, local time.
中新社记者 刘关关 摄检测成为舆论“靶心”潜在感染者到底还有多少？相较于物资，对于蔓延的疫情来说，更大的危险来自检测方面的严重失衡。
Liu Guan-guan, a reporter for the China News Agency, has become a "target" of public opinion on the number of potential infected people? Compared to materials, the spread of the epidemic, the greater danger comes from the serious imbalance in detection.
连日来，美国一些政界名人和社会名流优先检测，甚至没病、没症状也做检测的现象被舆论诟病。
Over the past few days, some political and social celebrities in the United States priority testing, even no disease, no symptoms of the phenomenon has been criticized by public opinion.
因为检测资源不足，这种“富人优先”在美国社会引发巨大争议，以致于特朗普在面对媒体的逼问时回应道：“也许这就是人生。
Given the scarcity of testing resources, this "rich first" has caused so much controversy in American society that Trump has responded to press calls: "Maybe that's life.
”其实，从疫情起始至今，美国落后的检测能力、严苛的检测标准，一直被舆论指为疫情蔓延的一大主因。
Indeed, since the beginning of the epidemic, America's poor surveillance capabilities and stringent testing standards have been cited by public opinion as a major cause of the epidemic.
美国疾控中心(CDC)数据显示，在1月和2月中旬前，几乎只有该中心的实验室拥有检测资格，平均每日检测样本数不超过100份。
Until January and mid-February, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), almost only the center's laboratories were eligible for testing, with an average of no more than 100 samples per day.
在经历了冗长耗时的审查程序后，美国食品和药物管理局终于在2月29日批准CDC以外的机构和实验室进行检测。
After a lengthy and time-consuming review process, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) finally approved testing in institutions and laboratories outside the CDC on February 29.
大规模检测开始后，美国的疫情曲线急速攀高。
Since mass testing began, the U. S. epidemic has skyrocketed.
以纽约州为例，该州确诊人数激增的原因除人员流动频繁外，也与其提高检测能力有关。
In the state of New York, for example, the surge in confirmed cases has been linked to increased testing capacity, in addition to high staff turnover.
州长科莫20日表示，纽约州在过去两周大幅加强新冠病毒检测能力。
Governor Komo 20 said the state of New York in the past two weeks to significantly strengthen the new crown virus detection capacity.
仅19日一天，纽约州就完成了10000次检测。
On the 19th day alone, the state of New York completed 10,000 tests.
哥伦比亚大学的研究人员认为，由于有很多无症状或症状轻微的病毒携带者，美国未检测到的病例数可能是目前确诊数字的11倍，这也反映出目前美国的检测能力还很滞后。
Researchers at Columbia University believe the number of undetected cases in the United States could be 11 times higher than the current number of diagnosed cases because of the high number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic carriers, reflecting the current lag in detection capacity in the United States.
“如果在疫情暴发之初进行广泛检测，控制疫情原本会更容易些。
"It would have been easier to control the outbreak if it had been tested extensively at the beginning of the outbreak.
”《纽约时报》此前评论，“错过了一系列机会，让美国各地的官员们只能摸黑工作，眼看着病例呈指数级增长”。
As The New York Times had previously observed, "a series of missed opportunities for officials across the country to work in the dark has seen cases grow exponentially."
