疫情未消散，我们迎来了一个特殊的“国际妇女节”——与热闹的买买买无缘，指着各个团购群补充日常物资；不再为聊胜于无的半天假期兴奋，而更想赶快从宅困家中的生活中解放。
The epidemic has not dissipated, and we are entering a special International Women's Day - not to buy or sell enthusiastically, to point to groups of buyers to replenish daily supplies; not to be excited about a half-day holiday, but to get out of the house more quickly.
被迫告别让钱包空瘪的购物狂欢，今年的3月8日，让我们有了契机，直面这个原本为争取女性平等而设立的节日。
Forced to part with the empty purse shopping spree, this March 8, let us have the opportunity to face up to the original set of women's equality for the festival.
武汉女人方方从“疫情上报第一人”张继先医生，到坚持写新冠日记的作家方方，再到让汉骂出圈的汉口阿姨和向副总理高喊“假的”的青山嫂子，女性成为新冠疫情中一股不容忽视的力量。
Wuhan woman Fang Fang from the "epidemic report to the first person" Zhang Jian, to adhere to write a new crown diary writer Fang Fang, to Han yelled out Auntie Hankou and "false" sister-in-law to the Deputy Prime Minister, women become a force to be reckoned with in the new crown epidemic.
一部分女性力量崛起背后，更多女性们仍然因性别差距饱受困扰。
Behind the rise of some women's power, more women still suffer from the gender gap.
世界经济论坛发布的《2020年全球性别差距报告》显示，2019年，从全球来看，两性平均差距缩小到68.6%，比去年有所改善，但全球仍有31.4%的性别差距有待缩小，在政治、经济领域的性别差距尤其巨大。
The Global Gender Gap Report 2020, published by the World Economic Forum, showed that, globally, the gender gap narrowed to 68.6 per cent in 2019, an improvement over the previous year, but 31.4 per cent of the global gender gap remained to be closed, especially in the political and economic spheres.
中国消除了67.6%的性别差距，在153个国家中排名第106位虽然男女平权仍然任重道远，但不可否认的是，近些年，女性意识正在觉醒，从好莱坞一路蔓延全球的metoo运动就是重要的佐证之一。
China has closed the gender gap by 67.6 per cent, ranking 106th out of 153 countries. Although much remains to be done to ensure equal rights for men and women, it is undeniable that women are awakening in recent years, as evidenced by the worldwide movement of metoo from Hollywood.
投射于影视剧作品上，女性角色的生存空间也受到越来越多关注。
Projection in the film and television drama works, the female characters living space has also received more and more attention.
《了不起的麦瑟尔夫人》将故事舞台设置在五六十年代的纽约，高学历、高颜值的全职太太蜜琪在老公出轨秘书后，重新开始人生，走上脱口秀舞台。
"The Great Lady MacArthur" sets the stage for the story in New York in the 1950s and 1960s, when the highly educated, high-powered wife, Michelle, starts her life again after her husband's cheating secretary.
《82年生的金智英》改编自同名小说，讲述了一个名叫金智英的女性在童年、学生时代、职业生涯以及婚姻生活中经历了一系列困境与迷茫后，得了一种间歇性扮演她人角色的心理病。
Jin Zhiying, born in 82, adapted from the novel of the same name, tells of a woman named Kim Chi-ying who experienced a series of difficulties and perplexities in her childhood, schooldays, career and marriage.
回归性别差异本身，今天我们想要聊聊“女性意识”这件事情。
Going back to sex differences per se, today we want to talk about "female consciousness."
我们问了不同年龄段、不同行业的女性们一个同样的问题：对你来说，“女性”的身份意味着什么？无论答案是什么，这个问题其实只想指向一件事情——即使成见还没有被打破，即使还没有找到方向，也希望你首先愿意去探索与尝试，为自己的人生做主。
We asked women of all ages and professions the same question: What does being "female" mean to you? Whatever the answer is, the question only points to one thing - even if the stereotype has not been broken, even if you haven't found your way, and hopefully you're willing to explore and try and make your own life choices first.
性别并不是判定人价值的法则，突破差异，学会爱自己，为自己感到自豪，才是关键所在。
Gender is not the rule for judging human worth. Breaking through differences and learning to love yourself and be proud of yourself is the key.
以下是她们的回答：我个人不太喜欢被任何“身份”去标签化，女性的前提是独立的个人。
Here is their answer: I personally do not like to be labeled by any "status," the premise of women is an independent individual.
一旦一个女性被赋予“女儿”、“老婆”、“母亲”这些标签，她很容易失去自我。
Once a woman is given the labels "daughter," "wife" and "mother," she easily loses herself.
但我并不是说，一个女性不能成为好的女儿、老婆或者母亲，只是这些身份不应该是她的全部。
But I'm not saying that a woman can't be a good daughter, wife, or mother, but these roles shouldn't be all she has.
我首先是我自己，然后性别女。
I'm myself first, then sex.
作为一名温和的“女拳”主义者，我认为女性和男性都是一样的。
As a moderate "feminist," I think women and men are the same.
我们不应该被刻板印象去限制每个人的发展。
We should not be stereotyped to limit everyone's development.
举个例子，女性一定不够强壮吗？拳击界的女选手吊打普通男性应该毫无压力吧。
For example, must women not be strong enough? Boxing women should have no pressure to slay ordinary men.
男性就一定不够温柔体贴吗？我觉得吴青峰就比一部分神经大条的女孩子要温柔多了呀。
Do men have to be gentle enough? I think Wu Qingfeng is more gentle than some big-skinned girls.
我希望所有的女性都能拥有自信，活出真实的自己。
I want all women to be confident and live their true selves.
于我而言女性身份与男性一样，只是一种性别。
To me, female identity is the same as male identity, just one sex.
生而为人，无法改变。
Man is born and cannot be changed.
但男/女分别代表着不同的个性，不同的优势。
But men and women represent different personalities and different strengths.
女性在语言方面相对更有优势，适应能力也比较强，感情偶尔细腻。
Women are relatively more advantageous in language, more adaptable, and occasionally delicate feelings.
但同时可能体力没那么好，太感性容易纠结（好像暴露了自己）。
But at the same time may not be so strong, too emotional easily tangled (as if exposed to their own).
通过出国读书，深切感受：在国外，女性和男性差别并不大，不会因为是女性就有所要求或者束缚。
Through the study abroad, the deep feeling: in foreign countries, women and men are not very different, not because they are women to demand or shackle.
她们一样可以过得自由肆意，随性洒脱，获得尊重。
They can live as freely as they please, freely and freely, and with respect.
甚至有些时候女性更隐忍，更坚强。
There are even times when women are more forgiving and stronger.
我非常享受用自己的方式，以女性的视角，乐观向上地去生活，温柔坦荡去爱，赤诚勇敢地对待这个世界。
I enjoy my own way, with a woman's perspective, optimistic and upward to live, gentle and open to love, treat the world with absolute courage.
首先这个问题，是把女性的身份作为一个单独的概念提出，那么我想是相对于男性身份概念而存在的。
First of all, the issue is the identity of women as a separate concept, then I think it is relative to the concept of male identity.
这样说并不是把这两者相对立的含义，对我来说，女性身份更多的是一些代表女性美好的，独特气息的一面。
This is not to say the opposite, for me, female identity is more of a symbol of the beautiful, unique flavor of women.
男女的差异上，比如说生育，你没法说这对于女性是绝对的优点或缺点。
When it comes to differences between men and women, such as fertility, you can't say that this is an absolute advantage or disadvantage for women.
生育的疼痛和后遗症对女性身体的物理伤害是肯定的，但从精神上也有很多女性能感到非同寻常的满足和愉悦。
The pain and after-effects of childbirth are positive for the physical health of women, but spiritually there are also many women who feel extraordinary satisfaction and joy.
我自己真的没思考过相对于男性的优缺点，但在职场上，女性依然是缺乏更多的平等机会，这是事实。
I don't really think about the pros and cons of men, but it's true that women still lack more equal opportunities in the workplace.
第一反应是意味着母亲。
The first reaction is to mean the mother.
但其实女性一辈子的身份都在不停切换，作为女儿、女朋友、妻子，我觉得很多女性是从来没有为自己活过的。
But in fact, the identity of women are constantly changing, as a daughter, girlfriend, wife, I think a lot of women have never lived for themselves.
在新的时代，我觉得女性的身份有了极大的变化，它意味着坚持自我、自信、坚强、独立（经济+人格）。
In the new era, I feel that the status of women has changed a lot, it means to adhere to self-confidence, strong, independent (economic + personality).
回归我自己本身，我觉得总体来说，相较于男性而言，社会对于女性没有那么宽容，女性承受着来自家庭和事业的双重压力。
Returning to myself, I think society as a whole is less tolerant of women than men, and women are under the pressure of both family and career.
女性的身份，意味着需要更多的付出，更多的承受，更多的被误解，更大的社会压力。
Women's identity, which means more to pay, more to bear, more to be misunderstood, greater social pressure.
家庭角色分工中，女性的付出的远远要比男性多，可收益并不平等。
In the division of family roles, women pay far more than men, but the benefits are not equal.
在职场，优秀的女性大多会冠以女强人的称谓，意味着家庭不保，因为没有更多地去投入家庭。
In the workplace, most good women will call themselves strong women, meaning that the family is not protected, because there is no more to invest in the family.
可男人似乎天生就不需要承担这些。
But men don't seem to be born with these responsibilities.
男性天生的征服欲是需要通过女性的柔弱去建立，但现实社会对柔弱并不友好。
Men's innate desire for subjugation needs to be established through the weakness of women, but the real world is not friendly to the weak.
成功需要用时间去积累，但女性在家庭中的角色定位，导致家庭和事业的兼顾困难。
Success takes time to accumulate, but the role of women in the family leads to difficulties in reconciling family and career.
对我来说，女性身份意味着能更加敏感细微地体察周边情绪，能更好地与世界共情，当然不是说男性就不可以，但是某些时刻，能花更多时间去体会细枝末节。
For me, being female means being more sensitive and sensitive to surrounding emotions and being able to empathize with the world, not that men can't, but that there are times when more time can be spent on the details.
我从心底接受自己，不是作为女性吧，而且作为一个独立个体。
I accept myself from the bottom of my heart, not as a woman, but as an individual.
大概是从以前开始就很较真，不服输去争第一。
Probably from the beginning is very true, do not admit defeat to fight first.
读书的时候考试前几名都是女生，学车的时候满分也是女生，后来工作了，我们企业一起晋升的也有很多女生。
When I was in school, the top few students were girls. When I learned to drive, I got a full mark as a girl.
看到女生在各行各业，不服输地去打破所谓的天花板，去和世界较劲，那个时候觉得，能成为女性之一太好了。
See girls in all walks of life, unconquerable to break the so-called ceiling, to fight the world, then feel that it is good to be one of the women.
在这样一个父权的社会、一个性别不平等的社会里，女性的身份意味着女性很多时候在生活中，在职场中会遭遇到一些性别歧视和性别暴力。
In such a patriarchal society, a gender-unequal society, female identity means that women often experience some gender discrimination and gender-based violence in their lives and in the workplace.
对于我来说，同样也是这样。
The same is true for me.
从小父母对男孩儿的教育和对女孩儿的教育就是不一样的。
The education of boys is not the same as that of girls from childhood.
男孩儿很多时候会被鼓励去表达自己，包括表达自己的愤怒；但是女孩儿很多时候就会被鼓励照顾别人的情绪。
Boys are often encouraged to express themselves, including their anger, but girls are often encouraged to take care of others' feelings.
因为结构性的性别不平等，男性处于一个相对特权的位置，女性处于一个相对弱势的位置，就家庭暴力而言的话，女性是主要的受害者，当然还有儿童。
Because of structural gender inequality, men are in a relatively privileged position, women are in a relatively vulnerable position, and in the case of domestic violence, women are the main victims and, of course, children.
在职场中，女性也会遭遇各种类型的一些性别歧视，比如从招聘的过程中可能就会因为是女性就不招，然后录取之后也会出现同工不同酬、职场天花板、退休年龄歧视、怀孕歧视等诸多问题。
In the workplace, women also encounter various types of gender discrimination, such as the possibility of not being recruited because they are women, followed by unequal pay for equal work, workplace ceilings, discrimination in retirement age, pregnancy discrimination, etc.
我在成为一个女权主义者之后，我就为我的女性身份很自豪。
After I became a feminist, I was proud of my womanhood.
那个自豪是源于尽管在这个社会中遭遇了很多性别不平等，而且看到很多性别不平等，但是我能够去觉察到这些是为什么以及通过自己的一些行动去带来一些改变。
That pride stems from the fact that, despite the many gender inequalities in our society and the many gender inequalities that we see, I am able to sense why and through some of my actions bring about some change.
写在最后：这篇文章的目的并非为了定义女性，也不为捍卫什么，而是希望去倾听女性们关于自身的真实想法，更好地理解她们。
Writing at the end: The purpose of this article is not to define women, nor to defend anything, but to listen to women's true ideas about themselves and to better understand them.
我们也希望“她”们，抛开“妻子”、“母亲”、“女儿”等等身份外，还能拥有不被任何事情、任何人约束的精彩。
We also hope that "she" children, leaving "wife," "mother," "daughter" and other status, but also have nothing to be restrained by anyone wonderful.
归根到底，每一种性别其实只是一种叠加属性，最重要的依然是我们作为人，作为万物之一，怎样去实现与创造自己的价值，活出自己的人生。
In the final analysis, each sex is really a superimposed attribute, and the most important thing is how we, as human beings, can realize and create our own values and live our lives.
最后，祝所有女性节日快乐。
Finally, I wish all women a happy holiday.
也希望终有一天，我们可以不再需要这个节日。
I also hope that one day, we can no longer need this festival.
