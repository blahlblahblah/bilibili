后来我回想，也挺后怕的。
I thought about it later, and I was scared.
我接诊阿姨的时候，给她查体，她对着我咳嗽过。
When I picked up my aunt, I checked her and she coughed at me.
口述 | 宋亚锋整理 | 黄　祺“突然听到一个消息，心情很不好，内心很恐惧，虽然根本不认识，但感觉很难过，一路走好，希望你的家人能够渡过难关！”2月7号这天，武汉一位医生因为感染新冠病毒去世，我特别难过，我在朋友圈看到这段话。
"Suddenly, at the news, I was in a bad mood and was scared. Though I didn't know him at all, I felt very sad and wanted your family to make it through.
那是我在新冠肺炎隔离病房工作的第十五天。
That was my fifteenth day working in the isolation ward of Newcastle Pneumonia.
我是个胃肠肛肠外科医生，我所在的武汉市第四医院（西区）是武汉市第一批被征用的新冠肺炎指定收治医院。
I am a gastrointestinal anal surgeon, and my Wuhan Fourth Hospital (Western Region) was the first designated hospital in Wuhan city to be requisitioned for new crown pneumonia.
从除夕那天上岗进入新冠肺炎隔离病房，第一轮上班到元宵节结束，现在我正在政府安排的宾馆隔离轮休。
I entered the isolation ward of Xinguan Pneumonia on New Year's Eve. I went to work from the first round to the end of Lantern Festival.
宋亚锋在隔离病房想想过去的这个月，我都经历了什么？只能说我很幸运，我在毫无防护之下接诊过新冠肺炎病人，居然没事。
Song Yafeng in the isolation ward to think about the past month, I have experienced? I can only say that I am fortunate that I have no protection in the treatment of patients, but it is all right.
身边同行、同事倒下了，有同事还住在我的病房里，想到种种已经发生的现实，有一种深深的无力感。
There was a deep sense of powerlessness in thinking about what had happened, as colleagues and colleagues fell down in my room.
我最近一直想理一理脑子，但是思绪太乱，理不清了。
I've been trying to think things over lately, but my mind is too muddled to make sense.
后来确诊的病人，曾对着我咳嗽了这是一场毫无准备的战争，开始的时间比新闻报道的要早一些。
The patient who was later diagnosed coughed at me This was an unprepared war, which began a little earlier than the news.
去年12月上旬武汉卫健委通报首例不明原因肺炎病例，到12月下旬，我就已经听说一些医院设立呼吸传染病隔离区。
By the end of December, I had heard that some hospitals had set up areas for respiratory infections.
武汉的医生圈子很小，绝大部分要么是武汉大学毕业的，要么是同济医学院毕业的。
Wuhan's circle of doctors is very small, most of them are either graduates of Wuhan University, or Tongji Medical College graduated.
在这个圈子里，有医生通过微信群谈及不明肺炎的消息已经传开了。
In this circle, the news of doctors speaking of unknown pneumonia through the microphone community has spread.
到了12月31日，武汉卫健委通报出现27例“病毒性肺炎”。
On December 31, Wuhan Health Commission reported 27 cases of "viral pneumonia."
我是胃肠肛肠外科医生，不大会接触到呼吸道疾病的患者，况且当时官方的说法是“这种传染病有限人传人”，所以尽管知道有传染病，但上班的时候还是没做什么刻意的防护，大家都没有做。
I was a gastrointestinal anal surgeon who was less likely to come into contact with patients with respiratory illnesses, and because the official version at the time was "limited human-to-human transmission" of the epidemic, there was little deliberate protection at work, and no one did it.
1月17日，我的一个老病人来看病。
On January 17, an old patient of mine came to see the doctor.
她是位60多岁的阿姨，几年前做了肠癌手术，手术后恢复良好，没做放化疗，一直在我这里定期复查。
She is an aunt in her sixties who had bowel cancer surgery a few years ago, recovered well after surgery, did not do chemotherapy, I have been regularly reviewed here.
每次复查，都没有发现复发迹象，也没有其他基础疾病，整个人状态挺好的。
At each review, there were no signs of recurrence, no other underlying disease, and the person was in good shape.
她来的时候症状是腹泻恶心，已经腹泻4天了，没有呼吸道症状，偶尔咳一下。
She came with diarrhea, nausea, diarrhea for four days, no respiratory symptoms, and occasional cough.
她说4天前跟朋友吃了一顿饭，回家后开始腹泻。
She said she had a meal with a friend four days ago and returned home with diarrhea.
我给她做了腹部CT，肠道没什么大问题，没找到她腹泻的原因。
I gave her an abdominal CT, no major intestinal problems, she did not find the cause of diarrhea.
住进医院两天后，阿姨出现发烧、干咳、呼吸急促。
After two days in hospital, my aunt developed fever, dry cough and shortness of breath.
我马上安排她去做胸部CT，片子拿来一看，我高度怀疑她得的是这个病。
I immediately arranged for her to have a chest CT, the film brought it, I highly suspect that she is suffering from the disease.
那时候大家就是这么称呼新冠肺炎的——“病毒肺”。
That was what people used to call Newcastle Pneumonia, the "viral lung."
打电话再次向放射科确认。
Call the radiology department again for confirmation.
阿姨意识清楚，非常信任我，我给她做了一些治疗，从鼻导管给氧，到储氧面罩给氧，病情仍在加重。
My aunt was conscious and trusted me so much that I gave her some treatment, from oxygen from the nasal catheter to oxygen from the oxygen mask, and the condition was still getting worse.
高度怀疑后，我给呼吸科打电话申请紧急会诊。
When I became highly suspicious, I called the respiratory department to apply for an emergency consultation.
呼吸科的医生来了，用了一些药物，但还是在恶化。
The ventilator doctor came and took some medicine, but it's getting worse.
当时要把病人转到呼吸科是不可能的，因为呼吸科病床早就住满了，连其他科内科也收治了一些肺炎病人。
It was impossible to transfer the patient to the respiratory department, which was already full, and other departments of medicine had admitted patients with pneumonia.
到了21号，阿姨病情已经非常重了，我想办法把她转到了呼吸科，上了高流量氧疗，再到无创呼吸机，最终还是没救过来。
By the 21st my aunt was very ill and I managed to transfer her to the respiratory department, where she received high-volume oxygen therapy and a non-invasive ventilator.
这个病毒特别奇怪，病人自始至终都是清醒的，病重患者就是血氧上不来，缺氧。
This virus is particularly strange, the patient is awake from beginning to end, serious patient is not on blood oxygen, hypoxia.
看着病人强烈的求生愿望，对生命的渴望，而我们医生只能眼睁睁地看着一条生命逝去却无能为力，那种压抑，那种沉重，那种无助，那种自责，那种无可奈何，足以将我们压垮。
Looking at the patient's strong desire to survive, his yearning for life, we doctors can only watch a life pass without help, the oppression, the heaviness, the helplessness, the remorse, the helplessness that overwhelms us.
后来我回想，也挺后怕的。
I thought about it later, and I was scared.
我接诊阿姨的时候，给她查体，她对着我咳嗽过。
When I picked up my aunt, I checked her and she coughed at me.
我们医院1月23日宣布被征用为新冠肺炎病人定点医院，所有医生上岗管新冠隔离病房。
On January 23, our hospital announced that it had been requisitioned as the Hospital for New Crown Pneumonia, and all doctors took charge of the new crown isolation ward.
这时候要求我们医生做检查，我的肺部CT显示是好的，应该是没事。
At this point our doctor is required to do an examination, my lung CT display is good, should be all right.
怎么说呢，幸运吧，我朋友说我上辈子积德。
Well, luckily, my friend said I was a jerk in my last life.
同事感染住进我管的病房从1月份开始，医院呼吸科已经人满为患了。
Colleague infection lodged in my ward Since January, the respiratory department of the hospital has been overcrowded.
为了收治这些肺炎病人，医院开始不停地扩病区，把其他科的病房腾出来收肺炎病人。
In order to treat these patients with pneumonia, the hospital began to spread the disease areas, other wards vacated to receive pneumonia patients.
腾出一个区，很快收满，又开一个新的病区。
To vacate a district, soon full, and open a new sick area.
我们做医生的都知道情况不乐观了，12月底医院有医生被派去增援金银潭医院，我的一个同学在另一家综合性医院，也被派去增援金银潭医院。
Our doctors knew that the situation was not encouraging. At the end of December, a doctor from the hospital was sent to reinforce the gold and silver pool hospital, and one of my classmates was sent to reinforce the gold and silver pool hospital in another general hospital.
那时候我们就知道，情况已经很严重了。
We knew then that the situation was already serious.
我的医院是一家综合性医院，平常较少用到隔离防护服这种高等级的防护物资，大家这方面的意识也不强，我们外科只有医用一次性口罩。
My hospital is a general hospital, usually less use of protective high-level protective clothing, we do not have a strong awareness of this, we surgical only disposable medical masks.
到现在，我们的防护物资也不充足。
So far, our supplies of protection have been inadequate.
医生们看到N95 1860— —就是那种绿色的口罩，都两眼放光。
The doctors saw N95 1860, the kind of green mask with glowing eyes.
我们医院总共有2000多名员工，截至1月14日的公开数据，医护人员中有53例确诊和疑似新冠肺炎。
Our hospital employs more than 2,000 people, and as of January 14, there were 53 confirmed and suspected cases of pneumonia.
外面的人可能以为呼吸科医护人员更容易被感染，其实不然。
People outside may think that respiratory staff are more likely to be infected, but that's not the case.
刚开始的时候，大家对这个疾病认识不足，防护意识差，其他科室中招的反倒多。
At the beginning, people do not know enough about the disease, protection awareness is poor, other departments recruit more.
现在同事之间气氛也很奇怪，也许你今天看到这个同事还好好的，说不定明天就发病，就确诊了。
Now the atmosphere between colleagues is also very strange, perhaps you see this colleague is still good today, perhaps tomorrow will be a disease, confirmed.
所以必要的间隔距离，是对同事也是对自己负责。
So the necessary distance between the colleagues is also responsible for their own.
宋亚锋我是除夕那天正式上岗进新冠肺炎隔离病房的。
Song Yafeng I was officially admitted to the isolation ward of Xinguan Pneumonia on New Year's Eve.
我这个班5个医生，是从不同科室组合过来的，诊疗方案主要是按照诊疗指南来，其实现在也没有特效药，主要是对症治疗。
My class of five doctors, from different units, the diagnosis and treatment program is mainly in accordance with the guidelines, in fact, there are no specific drugs, mainly symptomatic treatment.
目前我自己的经验，打免疫球蛋白，氧疗有比较好的效果，只要病人能挺过7-10天，大部分就能扛过来。
In my own experience so far, immunoglobulin and oxygen therapy have a better effect, as long as the patient can survive 7-10 days, most of them can carry it.
我管的病房里大约10%的病人病情比较重，我们最多的时候管38个病人。
About 10% of the patients in my ward were seriously ill, and we were in charge of 38 patients at most.
特别重的病人转不出去，因为救护车上没有病房里这个高压供氧设备，所以路途上太危险。
Particularly heavy patients were unable to get out because the ambulance did not have this high-pressure oxygen supply in the hospital room, so the journey was too dangerous.
我的这个病房里，收治了一些医院的同事。
Some of my hospital colleagues were admitted to my ward.
有一位我印象特别深刻。
I was particularly impressed by one.
他是医学博士，30多岁。
He's a doctorate in medicine. He's over 30.
一开始他非常消极，觉得不可能活着出去，后来我们把他转到了呼吸科，最后转到金银潭医院。
At first he was very negative and thought it was impossible to get out alive. Then we transferred him to the respiratory department and finally to the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital.
转诊其实风险很大的，我很感谢呼吸科的同仁们，他们备着气管切开包，跟着救护车护送同事转到了金银潭医院，值得欣慰的是，现在他已经从ICU转到普通病房了。
Referral is very risky, and I am grateful to my breathing colleagues, who were given tracheotomy kits and escorted by ambulance to the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital. Thankfully, he has now been transferred from ICU to the general ward.
只能坚持，等着天亮元宵节那天我从病房出来，轮休。
Can only insist, waiting for the dawn Lantern Festival I came out of the ward, the rotation.
2月15日 武汉一场大雪好消息也有，我们第一批次第一梯队的防疫医护人员，实现了所在隔离病区零医护人员感染、零患者死亡， 20余人顺利康复出院，取得了阶段性胜利目标。
February 15, Wuhan has a heavy snow good news, we first second echelon of the epidemic prevention personnel, achieved the quarantine area zero infection, zero patients died, more than 20 people successfully recovered from hospital, achieved the goal of stage victory.
上前线压力是很大的，在隔离轮休期间我尽量调整自己的心态，睡眠也得到了极大改善。
There was a lot of pressure on the front line, I was trying to adjust my mind during the break and I had a great deal of sleep.
刚开始我都怀疑我得了创伤性心理障碍，我一个师兄每天开导我，叫我少看网上的新闻，每天看看书听听音乐。
At first I suspected that I had a traumatic psychological disorder. One of my classmates taught me to watch less online news and listen to music every day.
他说他一个感染科的同事也差点崩溃了，后来靠这个办法缓解。
He said a colleague from his infection department nearly collapsed and was relieved.
怎么说呢，我得到的信息比别人多，所以我承受的痛苦就比别人多。
After all, I get more information than other people, so I suffer more than others.
前段时间一家广播媒体采访，我在广播里大哭一场，真的是特别不好意思，导播切到另一个医院的护士，护士也在广播里大哭一场。
Some time ago a broadcast media interview, I cried on the radio, really embarrassed, the director cut into another hospital nurses, nurses crying in the radio.
随着武汉市采取了强有力的管制措施，封锁武汉很大程度阻止了病毒向全国、全球蔓延。
With the strong control measures taken by Wuhan, the blockade of Wuhan has largely prevented the virus from spreading to the whole country and the world.
但对于武汉来说，经历了最艰难的三周，它已不堪重负。
But for Wuhan, after three most difficult weeks, it is already overburdened.
随着医院床位的扩张，方舱的建设，火神山、雷神山的投入使用，随着全国源源不断的物资援助，随着全国各地医护的支援，我们已经从最开始的慌乱无序，慢慢地走上了正轨。
With the expansion of the hospital bed, the construction of the square cabin, the use of the mountain of fire god, thunder Shenshan, with the continuous material assistance from all over the country, with the support of medical care throughout the country, we have started from the beginning of panic disorder, slowly on the right track.
宋亚锋的妻子也是医生天会亮，我们在坚持。
Song Yafeng's wife is doctor day will be bright, we insist.
