作者：刘倩来源：商业人物（ID：biz-leaders）“我还不想死”，电话里，张希突然哭了，她觉得自己有了复发的迹象——“一种从骨头里面钻出来的疼”，就像她在确诊急性淋巴细胞白血病前一样的疼法。
Author: Liu Qian (ID: biz-leadeers) "I don't want to die yet," Zhang burst into tears on the phone, feeling that she was having a relapse - "a pain coming out of the bone," just as she did before the diagnosis of acute lymphocytic leukemia.
生病将近一年，张希做了七次化疗，总算遏制住了癌细胞，还十分幸运地找到了配型相合的骨髓，只等春节后进仓移植。
After nearly a year of illness and seven chemotherapy treatments, Zhang managed to contain the cancer and luckily found the matching bone marrow waiting for the transplant after the Spring Festival.
满怀希望地回老家过了个团圆年，却被疫情带来的一系列连锁反应拖入了两难的境地，张希回不去医院，在老家又得不到有效治疗，原本一个月一次的化疗拖了近两个月还没做，她十分担心自己会复发，“如果复发了，可能就没有希望了”。
Having returned to her hometown for a full year of hope, but caught in a chain reaction caused by the epidemic, Zhang Xi could not go back to the hospital, there was no effective treatment at home, the once-a-month chemotherapy had been delayed for nearly two months, and she was very worried that she would relapse, "if it recurs, there may be no hope."
疫情的阴影下有一群白血病人，他们的常规治疗被迫中断，移植不得不暂停，还要面临缺血、断药、抢不到口罩等突发状况，在夹缝中挣扎求生。
In the shadow of the outbreak there was a group of leukaemia patients whose routine treatment had to be interrupted, their transplants had to be suspended, and they had to contend with an emergency situation, such as ischemia, disabling medicines and missing masks, struggling to survive in a seam.
无法进行的复诊和断了的药赵婷自嘲是被“赶”出医院的，在她做完骨髓移植手术的第17天、出移植仓的当天。
Unable to make the re-examination and the broken medicine ZhaoTing self-deprecation is "expelled" from the hospital, in her bone marrow transplant surgery after the 17th day, the day of the transplant.
在疫情最严重的武汉，出院是迫不得已，血液科的医生护士一部分被抽调到火神山医院，一部分去支援本院新冠肺炎患者的救治。
In Wuhan, where the epidemic was most severe, some of the doctors and nurses from the department of blood were evacuated to Mount Huoshen Hospital, partly to support the treatment of patients with the hospital's new crown pneumonia.
“如果没有这场肺炎，医院是绝对不会让我直接回家的，因为移植后或多或少都会有排异反应，住院可以随时调整用药”，她对“商业人物”说。
"If it had not been for the pneumonia, the hospital would never have let me go home directly, because there would have been more or less rejection after the transplant and hospitalization would be ready to adjust the medication," she told People in Business.
图为赵婷拍摄于移植仓，“仓内密封，很压抑，钟表下的一个窗户，供家人探望时使用。
Photographed by Zhao Ting in the transplant room, "the warehouse is sealed, very depressed, a watch under a window for family visits.
”“化疗过程中，每天要打十多个小时的针。
"Chemotherapy involves taking more than 10 hours of injections every day.
”一切都只有靠自己。
"Everything depends on itself.
赵婷每天戴着口罩躲在自己房间里，自查体温、心率，严格按照医嘱用药，还是不可避免地出现了肠胃和皮肤排异——拉肚子、脸发红、浑身无力，好在比较轻微，她只能通过微信询问她的主治医生，等待对方百忙之中的回复。
Zhao Ting wears a mask to hide in her room every day, check her temperature, heart rate, strictly follow the doctor's instructions, or inevitably there is gastrointestinal and skin rejection - diarrhea, red face, all weak, Fortunately, she can only ask her doctor through a micro-letter, waiting for the other side busy response.
在病友群，赵婷看到过比她严重得多的排异反应，“有的身上都掉皮了，还有的便血、吃稀饭都拉肚子”。
In the group of sick friends, Zhao Ting saw a much more serious rejection than her reaction, "some of the body fell off, there are blood, eat porridge all loose bowels."
看着他们，赵婷愈发担心自己，手里的药最多只能支撑两周，一旦断药，各种排异反应就会接踵而来。
Looking at them, Zhao Ting more worried about themselves, the hands of the drug can only last two weeks, once the drug, a variety of rejection will follow.
买药越来越困难，门诊停诊，定点药房只有早上十点到下午四点开门营业，很多人都是带着棉被夜里就去排队，赵婷的爸爸拿着十盒的处方，只买到了三盒。
The drug purchase is becoming more and more difficult, out-patient consultations, designated pharmacies only open between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., many people with quilts on the night line, Zhao Ting's father with 10 boxes of prescription, only bought three boxes.
林森前几日断药了。
Linson stopped taking pills the other day.
他的药都放在武汉的出租屋内，带回老家的只够吃到正月十五。
His medicine is put in Wuhan rental housing, take home only enough to eat until the fifteenth day of the first month.
小年前夕离开的时候，武汉还是一片风平浪静，短短几天，却是有“家”难回了。
The eve of the small year to leave, Wuhan or a calm sea, in a matter of days, but there is a "home" back.
武汉回不去，一个月一次的例行骨穿做不了，药也断了，林森觉得十分无助，“我们好像被抛弃了，起码应该保障正常复查吧”。
Wuhan can not go back, once a month routine bone can not do, medicine broken, Linson felt very helpless, "we seem to have been abandoned, at least should guarantee normal review."
“血液病人移植后是有心理压力的”，这份压力不只来自像揣着定时炸弹一样随时可能复发的疾病，还有漫长病程中花费的数十万巨款。
"There is psychological pressure after a blood transplant," not just from a disease that is likely to recur like a time bomb, but from the hundreds of thousands of dollars that go into the long journey.
林森已经花费了六十多万，眼看着离治愈越来越近了，他不想在最后关头功亏一篑。
With more than 600,000 dollars already spent, Linson did not want to falter at the last minute as he looked closer to a cure.
身在武汉，赵婷一样无法复查，医生也无法告诉她确切的时间，只说让等消息。
In Wuhan, Zhao Ting can not review, doctors can not tell her the exact time, only to say let the news.
她身上的PICC管却是一刻也不能等，每周都要清洗换药，否则就会感染。
The PICC tube she wears cannot wait for a moment. She has to wash and change her medication every week, or she will get infected.
感染，对他们这些几乎没有免疫力的血液病患者来说，意味着生命危险，而拔管同样有危险，“像我们这种才出仓几天的人是绝对不可以拔的，还没过危险期，如果复查结果不好，大剂量的打针、化疗都要通过这根管”。
Infection, which can be life-threatening for people with blood disease, who have little immunity, is just as dangerous as pulling out a tube. "People like us who are only out of stock for a few days are absolutely not allowed to pull out, not yet in danger, if the outcome of the review is bad, large doses of injection, chemotherapy through this tube.
谈“肺炎”色变2月9日开始，小俊发烧37.5℃，并伴有咳嗽，11日CT显示磨玻璃样阴影，疑似新冠肺炎。
On February 9, Xiao Jun had a fever of 37.5 ℃, accompanied by a cough. CT showed a grinded glass-like shadow on February 11.
他的母亲邓春来听到后“感觉天都塌了”。
When his mother, Deng Chunlai, heard it, "it felt like the sky had collapsed."
小俊今年13岁，是一名急性淋巴细胞白血病患者，骨髓移植术后八个月，一直在陆道培医院定期复查。
Xiaojun, a 13-year-old patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, has been under regular review at Ludopei Hospital for eight months after a bone marrow transplant.
肺部感染是白血病患者常见的并发症，却在这个谈“肺炎”色变的特殊时期，给他们带来了更大的麻烦。
Pulmonary infection is a common complication of leukemia patients, but in this particular period of "pneumonia" color change, they brought more trouble.
有确诊资格的医院规定，只有住院才可以进行核酸检测，却不敢接收白血病患儿，而陆道培医院则要求必须首先排除新冠肺炎才可入院。
Hospitals with confirmed qualifications require only hospitalization for nucleic acid testing, but not for children with leukaemia, while Ludwig Hospital requires exclusion of new crown pneumonia before admission.
邓春来带着小俊在发热门诊从早上九点等到晚上八点，始终没有等来一张床位。
Deng Chunlai and Xiaojun took him to the fever clinic from 9: 00 a.m. to 8: 00 p.m. and never waited for a bed.
邓春来认为，小俊不会是新冠肺炎，孩子已经半个月没有出过门了，他们住的燕郊至今尚未有确诊病例，但她还是忍不住担心，怕孩子因此耽误治疗。
Deng Chunlai believes that Xiaojun will not be the new crown pneumonia, the child has not been out of the house for half a month, they live in the suburbs so far not confirmed cases, but she can not help but worry that their children will delay treatment.
“移植之后，肺部感染严重的话，会有生命危险”，邓春来焦虑得一夜没睡，始终守在孩子身边，“怕他呼吸突然衰竭”。
"After the transplant, if the lung infection is serious, it can be life-threatening," Deng Chunlai worried all night, and stayed by the child's side "for fear of sudden respiratory failure."
回家观察的小俊情况不好，血氧94，心率120，没精神，没胃口，没力气。
Going home to observe the situation of Sik is not good, blood oxygen 94, heart rate 120, no spirit, no appetite, no energy.
三年前，就在小俊刚刚确诊白血病的时候，他也经历过一次肺部感染，在ICU里住了半个月，花了26万块钱。
Three years ago, when Sik was first diagnosed with leukaemia, he also had a lung infection and spent half a month in the ICU, spending 260,000 yuan.
移植后这大半年小俊的情况一直很平稳，邓春来本以为是苦尽甘来，没想到儿子却在这个节骨眼出现了肺感染症状。
After the transplant the situation has been very smooth, Deng Chunlai thought it was hard to come, but the son in this bone-bone lung infection symptoms.
“如果不是新冠肺炎，早就能住院了，这么耽误着，心里没底”，邓春来也在盘算手里的钱，多耽误一天，肺炎就难治一分，费用也会更多。
"Had it not been for the pneumonia, he would have been hospitalized, delayed, and inwardly inquisitive." Deng Chunlai was also calculating the money in his hand.
小俊生病以来，已经花费了100多万，邓春来因此背上了数十万元的债务，这些都要她独自承担。
Since her illness, Sik has spent more than one million yuan, and Deng Chunlai has been burdened with hundreds of thousands of yuan of debts, which she has to bear alone.
她手里只剩下3万块钱，“如果感染严重了肯定不够”，还有8万多元的报销款，因为疫情的原因不能及时结算，无疑是雪上加霜。
She had only 30,000 dollars left, "not enough if the infection is serious" and more than 80,000 yuan in reimbursement, because the cause of the outbreak can not be settled in a timely manner, no doubt added insult to injury.
邓春来甚至想到了最坏的结果，“孩子万一有个三长两短，连老家都回不去”，说到这，她忍不住哭了出来，“不知道自己还能撑多久”。
Deng Chunlai even thought of the worst case, "children in case of trouble, even home can not go back," she said, tears, "I do not know how long I can stay."
移植被迫中断移植计划戛然而止。
The transplant plan was cut short.
吴悠最后的机会也变得渺茫。
Wu Yo's last chance also becomes slim.
生病的三年间，吴悠辗转看过许多医生，几乎都被判了“死刑”。
During his three years of illness, Wu saw many doctors and almost all were sentenced to death.
这段时间，她一直在低烧，却查不出原因，只能依靠药物和输血压制着，医生说最好的办法就是尽快移植。
In the meantime, she had been suffering from a low fever, but could not find the cause. Instead, she had to rely on drugs and blood transfusions to suppress it.
正月初六，是原定的进仓日，吴悠很幸运，在中华骨髓库找到了两位配型全相合的供者，父亲吴凡作为他们的备份，准备好了人，也准备好了钱。
Wu Yu was lucky to find two matching donors in the Chinese bone marrow bank on Saturday, and his father, Wu Fan, as their backup, was ready and ready to pay.
得知女儿可以做骨髓移植手术，并且医生估计有七八成把握的时候，吴凡觉得像是有人给他打了一剂强心针。
Knowing that his daughter could have a bone marrow transplant and the doctor estimated that seven or eight of them were sure, Wu felt as if someone had given him a powerful injection.
他卖了老家襄阳唯一的房产，计划用这笔21万的卖房钱加上从信用卡里借出的十几万元，让女儿先进仓，剩下的再去借高利贷，“我一直没有想过放弃，就算砸锅卖铁也要治”。
He sold his only home in Xiangyang, and plans to use the 210,000 yuan plus hundreds of thousands of yuan borrowed from his credit card to get his daughter in first, and the rest to borrow usurious interest.
疫情打乱了所有的计划。
The outbreak upset all plans.
两位供者无法去医院完成身体检查，移植被迫中断，吴凡想把自己的骨髓捐给女儿，却被告知血源不足，进仓风险太大，只能继续维持，但很快吴悠连日常治疗用血都输不上了。
The donors were unable to go to the hospital for a medical examination and the transplant was interrupted. Wu Fan wanted to donate his bone marrow to his daughter.
寒暑假期间，献血主力军学生放假回家带来了“季节性血荒”，疫情爆发后，很多繁华商圈的流动献血点关闭，进一步加剧了“血荒”。
During the winter and summer holidays, the main force of blood donation students brought home the "seasonal blood shortage", after the outbreak of the epidemic, many prosperous business circles of mobile blood donors closed, further exacerbated the "blood shortage."
对于每周都要输一次血，每隔四五天就要输一次血小板的吴悠来说，输不上血是致命的。
For Wu, who loses blood once a week and platelets every four or five days, losing blood can be fatal.
她变得极度虚弱，头晕、心慌、躺在床上不能起身，拉着大夫的手哀求，“我太难受了，你帮我输血吧”。
She became extremely weak, dizzy, perturbed, unable to stand up in bed, took the doctor by the hand and begged, "I am so sick, you can give me a blood transfusion.
吴悠是个乐观的姑娘，在父亲眼中“求生欲强，心态好”，这次没法做移植，又输不上血，她显得很失望，说了好几次“不治了，我们回家吧”。
Wu Yu is an optimistic girl, in his father's eyes "survival strong, good mentality," this time no transplant, lost blood, she looked very disappointed, said several times "died, let's go home.
“她也知道家里实在没钱了”，吴凡不知道他还能去哪筹钱——唯一的房产已变卖，亲戚朋友早已借遍，信用卡即将逾期，想去借高利贷却因为交通管制寸步难行。
"She also knows that there is no money in the family." Wu did not know where he could go to raise money - the only real estate had been sold, relatives and friends had already borrowed money, credit cards were about to expire, and usury was difficult because of traffic control.
移植遥遥无期，每日的花费至少5000元，欠费就会被停药，这样的日子吴凡不知道什么时候才会结束，他也不知道该去怪谁，“天灾人祸，只能说我们赶上的时候不好”。
Wu did not know when it would be over, and he did not know who to blame. "Natural or man-made disasters can only be said that it is not good for us to catch up."
作为父亲，吴凡没有办法眼睁睁看着女儿在有很大希望治愈的时候放弃，他更没有办法接受，假如女儿的生命即将走到尽头，这个原因不是病情的恶化，而是不得不中断的治疗。
As a father, Wu could not watch his daughter give up when there was great hope of a cure, and he could not accept that if his daughter's life was about to come to an end, it was not the deterioration of her condition but the interruption of treatment.
好消息和坏消息采访结束的两天后，我陆续收到了他们最新的消息。
Good News and Bad News Two days after the interview, I continued to receive updates from them.
张希顺利回到了医院所在地，再隔离14天，她就可以开始第八次化疗，医生说她的症状不像是复发。
Zhang returned to the hospital site, and after 14 days of isolation, she was able to start chemotherapy for the eighth time. Doctors said her symptoms did not seem to recur.
林森从药贩子手里买的药，通过顺丰快递寄到了河南老家，他还在县医院化验了血常规，一切正常。
Linson from the drug dealers, through Shunfeng express sent to his hometown in Henan, he also tested in the county hospital blood routine, all normal.
小俊在当地卫计委的协调下于12日晚被定点医院收治，之后两次核酸检验均为阴性，排除了新冠肺炎感染，15日转入陆道培医院进行下一步治疗。
Xiaojun under the coordination of the local health and planning commission was admitted to the hospital on the night of 12, after two Nucleic acid tests were negative, excluding the new crown pneumonia infection, 15 days referred to Ludopei Hospital for further treatment.
吴悠输了一次血，精神好了很多，吴凡东拼西凑了几千块钱，赶在停药之前充进了治疗费中，他们还在等待可以进仓移植的那天。
Wu Yue lost a blood, the spirit of a lot better, Wu Fan put together several thousand pieces of money, before the drug stopped charging into the treatment, they are waiting for the day can be transplanted.
赵婷带来了一个坏消息。
Zhao Ting brought bad news.
她的PICC管无法继续维护，14日拔除了。
Her PICC tube could no longer be maintained and was removed on the 14th.
在病友不断拨打市长热线的要求下，每周四、五临时开放的PICC维护门诊，只持续了两周，下周或将再次关闭，直到疫情结束。
The temporary opening of the PICC maintenance clinic on Thursdays and Fridays lasted only two weeks and may be closed again next week until the end of the epidemic, at the request of patients who have repeatedly called the Mayor's hotline.
赵婷在群里挨个通知还未拔管的病友，至于未来，她说走一步看一步吧，“2020年的愿望，活着就好”。
Zhao Ting in the group one by one notice has not been pulled out of the sick friends, as for the future, she said step by step look at it, "2020 aspirations, live well.
