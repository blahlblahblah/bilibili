对疾病的认识有个过程，它不会一开始就展露全貌，公布信息要谨慎。
There is a process of understanding disease that does not begin with full disclosure, but with caution.

新京报讯（记者 许雯）昨日，中国疾控中心等十余家机构发表于新英格兰医学杂志的一篇论文披露，12月中旬新型冠状病毒已经出现“人传人”，有网友据此质疑，中国疾控中心在疫情早期隐瞒了这些信息，导致公众误判。
A paper published yesterday in the New England Journal of Medicine by a dozen organizations, including the China CDC, revealed that the new coronavirus had passed from person to person in mid-December, leading some netizens to doubt that the CDC had concealed the information early in the epidemic, leading to a public miscalculation.
1月31日，该论文通讯作者之一、中国疾控中心副主任冯子健接受新京报记者专访时表示，上述推论是1月23日获得病例数据后做出的，没有隐瞒。
In an interview with the Beijing News on January 31, Feng Zijian, one of the paper's co-authors and deputy director of the China CDC, said the inference was made after case data became available on January 23.
中国疾控中心到底何时发现病毒有“人传人”迹象？冯子健回应说，早期已经有“人传人”的看法，但受当时条件限制，谨慎作出“未发现明显人传人现象”“不能排除有限人传人的可能”等结论。
When did the CDC find evidence of "human-to-human" transmission of the virus? Feng responded that there had been "human-to-human" views in the early days, but cautioned against such conclusions as "no apparent human-to-human transmission" and "the possibility of limited human-to-human transmission" within the constraints of the time.
“结论是保守的，当然也是谨慎的”新京报：论文中提到12月中旬新型冠状病毒已经出现“密切接触者间的人际传播”，这个推论是什么时候作出的？冯子健：1月23日拿到数据，看到有一些没有华南海鲜市场暴露史的病例，作出的这个推论。
"The conclusion is conservative and certainly cautious" The Beijing News: When did the inference in the paper that the new coronavirus had appeared in mid-December "interpersonal transmission among close contacts" be made? Feng Zijian: On January 23, he saw a number of cases with no history of exposure in the South China seafood market.
新京报：什么时候意识到病毒可能“人传人”？冯子健：其实“人传人”的推论，我们比较早就已经有这样的看法。
The Beijing News: When did you realize that the virus might "pass from person to person"? Feng Zijian: In fact, we have been thinking about it for a long time.
但这个过程需要调查核实，包括详细询问、核实每个患者的暴露史。
This process, however, requires investigation and verification, including detailed questioning and verification of each patient's history of exposure.
我们最初获得的27个病例，其中26个病例都有华南海鲜市场暴露史，只有1个没有，所以当时作出患者“因华南海鲜市场暴露感染”的推测是占上风的。
Of the 27 cases we initially received, 26 had a history of exposure to the South China seafood market, and only one did not, so the assumption that patients were "exposed to infection in the South China seafood market" prevailed at the time.
另外，新型冠状病毒的检测方法在1月11日之后才逐渐使用。
In addition, the new coronavirus detection method was only gradually used after January 11.
在这之前，无法对病例分类，因为这个季节流感、腺病毒感染也很多。
Until then, it was not possible to categorize cases because of the high number of influenza, adenovirus infections this season.
如果一开始不把暴露史作为优先标准，就会造成很多misclassification，也就是流行病学中说的“错分”。
If exposure history is not a priority in the first place, there is a lot of misclassification, which is what epidemiology calls "wrong scores."
所以，我们第一时间并不是确认暴露来源，而是要确定这是不是一个独立的、新的疾病，还是其他疾病在这个季节、在某个医院突然出现的聚集性升高。
So the first thing we need to do is not to identify the source of the exposure, but to determine whether it is an independent, new disease, or whether other diseases suddenly increase during this season, in a hospital.
在最开始的几天，这是最首要的任务。
In the first few days, this is the most important task.
我们要尽量找到“一致”，比如有共同暴露、临床特征比较一致。
We should try to find "consistency," such as common exposure and consistent clinical features.
当我们确认这是一个独立的、新的疾病之后，还需要扩展检测，搜索是不是还有肺炎特征比较相似但可能无华南海鲜市场暴露史，即最开始判断的暴露因素之外的病例，是一个逐渐扩展的过程。
When we confirm that this is an independent, new disease, we need to scale up the search for cases with similar pneumonia characteristics that may not have a history of exposure to the South China seafood market, that is, cases other than the first known exposure factor, a gradual expansion process.
这个过程中面临的困难是没有诊断试剂，不知道是不是同一个病，所以下结论就比较谨慎。
The difficulty in this process is that there is no diagnostic reagent, do not know whether the same disease, so it is more prudent to draw conclusions.
当有了检测试剂之后，早期迹象也表明，刚开始用时，试剂对上呼吸道、下呼吸道标本阳性检出率比较低，我们不敢轻易排除掉。
When reagents are available, there are early indications that, at the beginning of use, positive detection rates for upper respiratory tract and lower respiratory tract specimens are relatively low, and we dare not rule them out easily.
受这种早期的限制，我们下结论就非常谨慎。
Given this early limitation, we are cautious in drawing conclusions.
但是，我们从最早开始，就把它当作有高度传染性的疾病来对待，第一时间采取了密切接触者管理等措施。
But we treated it as a highly contagious disease from the very beginning, first taking measures such as close contact management.
对疾病的认识有个过程，它不会一开始就把全貌展露出来。
There is a process of understanding disease that does not begin with a full picture.
公布信息总是要谨慎的，所以从开始的“未发现明显人传人现象”到“不能排除有限人传人的可能”，这都和病例诊断、实验室检测结果逐步用于病人的甄别有关，需要一个过程。
Disclosing information is always done cautiously, so it takes a process from the beginning of "no apparent human-to-human transmission" to "the possibility of limited human-to-human transmission," which is related to case diagnosis and the gradual application of laboratory test results to patient screening.
新京报：现在看起来，当初做出的“未发现明显人传人现象”“不能排除有限人传人的可能”的判断是不是有些保守？冯子健：是保守的，当然也是谨慎的，只能看到什么说什么，我们一直都很谨慎地观察。
The Beijing News: It seems that the original judgment that "no obvious person-to-person phenomenon" could not be ruled out is a little conservative? Feng Zijian: It is conservative, of course, and cautious, and we always watch carefully what we can see and say.
“没有隐瞒数据”新京报：医务人员感染是什么时候知道的？冯子健：大概1月19日、20日，钟南山院士到前线后，当地、国家级专家把结果告诉了他，他20号晚上回到北京之后，接受媒体采访披露有医务人员感染，接着武汉市卫健委作了披露，是这样的过程。
When did the Academician Feng Zijian inform him of the results when he returned to Beijing on January 19th and 20th, and gave a media interview after he returned to Beijing on the evening of 20 that there was an infection among medical personnel.
新京报：武汉协和医院首批感染的一名医生1月16日已经入院治疗。
NEW JING NEWS: A doctor who was among the first to get infected at Wuhan Concord Hospital was admitted to hospital on January 16.
1月16日中国疾控中心没有接到医务人员疑似感染的消息吗？冯子健：这个我不是特别清楚。
Didn't the CDC receive any news of a suspected infection among medical staff on January 16th? Feng Zijian: I'm not particularly aware of that.
数据上报的层级很多，包括国家级、省级、市级、区级，从区一级承担疫情调查任务的部门开始，数据上报有个过程。
There are many levels of data reporting, including at the national, provincial, municipal and district levels, starting with the sector responsible for the investigation of the epidemic at the district level, where there is a process of data reporting.
这个过程我没有详细了解。
I don't know the process in detail.
新京报：传染病网络直报系统不是可以将传染病信息2个小时直达国家层面吗？冯子健：网络直报的启用没有那么早。
The Beijing News: Isn't the Communicable Disease Network Direct Reporting System able to deliver infectious disease information directly to the national level for two hours? Feng Zijian: The launch of direct online reporting was not so early.
新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎是一个新发疾病，在传染疾病报告目录里是没有的，调整网络直报系统设置、人员培训需要一个过程。
Pneumonia, a new coronavirus infection, is a new disease. It is not found in the catalogue of infectious diseases.
新京报：有网友质疑中国疾控中心隐瞒数据，对这种质疑怎么看？冯子健：没有这种情况。
Beijing News: Some netizens doubt that China CDC conceals data. What do you think of this kind of doubt? Feng Zijian: There is no such thing.
我们国家公布疫情数据有相应的规则，比如传染病法，各个机构都按照各自职能来进行。
Our country publishes epidemic data corresponding to the rules, such as the infectious diseases law, each agency according to their respective functions.
中国疾控中心发表论文主要是给国际同行参考，这也是必要的，外国的公共卫生界、科学界、医学界的同行都希望了解信息，在国际著名医学杂志上发表数据和研究结果，能够提升数据的公信力和信任度。
It is also necessary for the CDC to publish its papers for international peer review. Foreign counterparts in the public health, scientific, and medical communities all want information, and the publication of data and research results in internationally renowned medical journals can enhance the credibility and credibility of the data.
这也是中国疾控中心作为一个专业机构的职责。
This is also the role of the CDC as a professional body.
“对错好坏事后再反思，现在要全力应对疫情”新京报：还有人质疑，中疾控专家在12月31日到达武汉之后在疫情防控方面没有作为。
"Right and wrong after the reflection, now to fully deal with the outbreak of the Beijing News: Some people doubt that experts in the disease control after December 31 arrived in Wuhan, did not do anything about disease control.
冯子健：其实一直在作为。
Feng Zijian: Actually has been doing.
现在不是把精力转到这方面的时候，我们现在要全力应对当下的疫情。
Now is not the time to turn our attention to that, but to focus on the current epidemic.
至于其中的对错、好坏，可能要到事后再做反思、检讨，现在不要分散过多的精力。
As for the right and wrong, good or bad, may have to do second thoughts, review, now do not disperse too much energy.
新京报：下一步的疫情防控重点是什么？冯子健：重点在于落实现在的防控措施。
The Beijing News: What are the key points for prevention and control in the next step? Feng Zijian: The key is to implement the current control measures.
防控整体目标是阻断传播途径，阻断人与人之间传播。
The overall goal of prevention and control is to block transmission and human-to-human transmission.
可能最先达成这个目标的是湖北及武汉以外的地区，这些地区疫情传播还处于非常早期，在这个阶段把疫情传播压制住，然后腾出更大的力量解决湖北和武汉这些重点地区的传播问题，防控压力就会小得多。
This is likely to be achieved first in areas outside Hubei and Wuhan, where the epidemic is still at a very early stage, and where much more effort is needed to address the spread of the disease in key areas such as Hubei and Wuhan, the pressure on prevention and control will be much less.
新京报：春节假期结束会不会给疫情防控带来很大压力？冯子健：那当然会了，所以这需要各个部门、每个人都要理解，现在处在非常关键的阶段，大家在共同努力，要积极配合，现在采取的措施可能对大家工作生活产生影响，希望公众能抱有理解和支持的态度。
Beijing News: Will the end of the Spring Festival put a lot of pressure on the prevention and control of the disease? Feng Zijian: Of course it will, so it needs to be understood by all departments and everyone.
大家一起携手共同应对，共同抗击疫情。
Together, we are working together to combat the epidemic.
新京报：有专家预测，正月十五疫情会出现拐点。
The Beijing News: Some experts predict that the first 15 months of the epidemic will appear inflection point.
你怎么判断？冯子健：现在不做这种预期，其实谁都难以做出这种判断。
How do you judge? Feng Zijian: No one can really make such a judgment without making such an expectation now.
我们就是冷静、认真地观察各项防控措施落实情况。
We are calmly and earnestly observe the implementation of various control measures.
