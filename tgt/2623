本报记者 晏国文 伍月明 北京 广州报道在口罩成为当下最紧俏物资的情况下，2月以来，健客网创始人苏展却多次公开实名举报健客网与CEO谢方敏销售假口罩。

苏展举报称，“公司小股东谢方敏利用公司APP和Jianke.com平台，以高于市场十倍的价格销售三无假口罩。
"Xie Fangmin, a minority shareholder in the company, used the company's APP and Jianke.com platforms to sell three mask-free masks at a price ten times higher than the market," the report said.
目前已经接到来自全国各地众多受害群众的投诉。
Complaints have been received from a large number of victims throughout the country.
”3月2日，广州市黄埔区市场监督管理局回复《中国经营报》记者称，对健客网有过两次核查。
On March 2, the Huangpu District Market Surveillance Administration of Guangzhou responded to China Business Daily by saying that it had checked the website twice.
第一次未发现有哄抬物价行为，第二次对涉嫌销售假冒伪劣口罩行为已经进行立案，正在调查中。
The first did not find price increases, the second suspected sales of fake and shoddy masks have been registered, is under investigation.
在疫情期间，一家知名网上药店创始人为何会举报自己的公司销售三无假口罩呢？3月1日，苏展向记者解释称，自己的证据也是来自于网友对健客网的投诉。
During the outbreak, why did the founder of a well-known online pharmacy report that his company was selling three fake masks? On March 1, Su told reporters that his evidence came from a complaint by netizens against Guinness.
“因为假药、假口罩的出现触及了做人做事的基本底线。
"The appearance of fake medicines and masks has touched the bottom line.
这是我不能忍受的。
I can't stand it.
”苏展说。
"said Suzanne.
据苏展透露，其作为健客网的创始人，多年来一直放权，由谢方敏全权经营管理健客网。
According to the Soviet exhibition, as the founder of the health-care network, has been decentralized for many years, Xie Fangmin full management of the health care network.
经过几轮融资，健客网搭建了VIE架构，已经估值数亿美元，还曾计划赴美国上市。
After several rounds of funding, HJN has built a VIE structure, valued at hundreds of millions of dollars, and has plans to list in the US.
不过，在2019年7月，因争夺公司公章，双方就已经爆发冲突。
However, in July 2019, the conflict between the two sides erupted over the official seal of the company.
然而，谢方敏对苏展所举报的内容予以了否认。
However, Xie Fangmin denied the content of the report.
3月2日，谢方敏向记者表示，健客网平台所售口罩均合规合法，很多投诉都是子虚乌有。
On March 2, Xie Fangmin told reporters that all the masks sold on the platform were legal and many of the complaints were false.
谢方敏说，“苏展并不是公司大股东，而只是一名小股东，目前实际投票权不到30%，并且还在去年被公司董事会集体决定罢免。
"Su is not a majority shareholder, but a minority shareholder. He currently has less than 30 percent of the vote and was collectively removed by the company's board last year," Xie said.
”不过，谢方敏未对该公司已被广州市黄埔区市场监督管理局立案调查一事做出回应。
However, Xie did not respond to the fact that the company had been opened by the Huangpu District Market Supervision Authority in Guangzhou.
被“掉包”的口罩记者注意到，在某网络投诉平台上，疫情期间针对健客网的口罩销售投诉不少。
The "swapped" mask reporter noticed that in a network of complaints platform, during the epidemic against the sale of healthy net mask many complaints.
3月2日，福建地区的消费者小王告诉记者，自己原本购买的是医用外科口罩，没想商家在没有告知的情况下，就自行替换成了一次性蓝色无纺布口罩。
March 2, Fujian area consumer Xiao Wang told reporters that his original purchase is a medical surgical mask, did not think of the businessman in the absence of notice, the replacement of a disposable blue non-woven mask.
其提供的订单截图显示，口罩的生产商也由广东宏瑞医疗器械有限公司替换成了广州市仕骤诚无纺布制品有限公司。
The orders showed that the mask manufacturer was replaced by Guangdong Hongrui Medical Device Co. Ltd. with Guangzhou Shucheng Non-woven Products Co. Ltd.
小王第一时间联系客服质询。
Xiao Wang first contact customer service inquiry.
健客网客服表示，“由于订购的医用外科口罩货源紧张，暂时缺货，因此替换成了独立包装的口罩。
"We are temporarily out of stock due to the shortage of medical surgical masks ordered, so we have replaced them with individually wrapped masks," the website said.
”而当小王提到要投诉时，其客服则表示需要提供商品名称、类目、维价形式、厂商联系方式等，如资料提供不全，则不受理维护。
When Wang mentioned filing a complaint, his customer service said he needed to provide trade names, categories, price forms and contact details of manufacturers.
记者查询工商信息发现，广州市仕骤诚无纺布制品有限公司并不存在。
Reporters inquiry industrial and commercial information found that Guangzhou Shixuncheng non-woven products limited company does not exist.
与其名字一字之差的广州市仕璟诚无纺布制品有限公司成立于2017年4月12日，所属行业为纺织业，其经营范围为棉织造加工、麻织造加工等业务，不包括医用口罩相关业务。
With its name one word difference, the Guangzhou prosperous prosperous non-woven products limited company was founded on April 12, 2017, belongs to the textile industry, its business scope is cotton knitting, hemp weaving, etc. business, does not include the medical mask business.
3月3日，健客网再发布声明称，该生产厂家实为广州市仕璟诚无纺布制品有限公司，公司资质齐全，产品也符合质检要求。
March 3, healthy guest net reissues statement to say, this manufacturer is Guangzhou prosperous prosperous non-woven product limited company, the company qualification is complete, the product also complies with the quality inspection request.
广州市黄埔区市场监管局已派员前往该公司调查询问，情况属实。
The Huangpu District Market Supervisory Authority of Guangzhou has sent personnel to the company to investigate the situation.
记者从广州市仕璟诚无纺布制品有限公司求证到，该公司确实有供货给健客网。
Our reporter from Guangzhou prosperous non-woven products Co. Ltd. to prove that the company does have the supply to the healthy guest network.
“我们一直在做外贸业务，之前曾把供应韩国超市的口罩库存产品一万只给了健客网。
"We have been trading in foreign trade and have given 10,000 products from the supply of masks in Korean supermarkets to the website.
后来，政府征用了我们的口罩，拿去送检后也通过了。
Later, the government requisitioned our masks and sent them for inspection.
”该公司相关负责人表示。
The head of the company said.
3月2日，记者登录健客网APP查询相关产品的信息，并没有搜索到上述公司所生产口罩。
March 2, reporter log on the website APP related products information, did not search for the company's production masks.
对此，客服人员表示该产品暂时缺货。
In response, customer service personnel said the product was temporarily out of stock.
不过，令人不解的是，其他产品尽管缺货会在页面标明无货，但此产品信息却已经下架。
However, it is puzzling that other products have been removed from the shelves despite the fact that stock-outs indicate that they are not available.
并非只有小王所购买的口罩遭遇掉包。
It is not only Wang who bought the mask that suffered swaps.
消费者小蕊向记者反映，自己用健客网的APP花了29.9元（使用优惠券后的价格）在平台上购买了两个N95口罩，但商家发的货却是创卫9025V口罩，并非是自己要购买的那一款。
Pistil told reporters that he spent 29.9 yuan (after the use of coupons) on the platform to buy two N95 masks, but the merchant issued Chuang Wei 9025 V mask, not their own purchase.
让小蕊气愤的是，“原本想这口罩能戴就行，仔细一看口罩上还有污渍，就不敢用了。
To his indignation, "I thought this mask could be worn, carefully look at the mask stains, do not dare to use it."
”此后，由于当时疫情还不明朗，小蕊所在城市的快递已经停运，也无法进行退货。
Since then, because the outbreak was still unclear, the city where Xiaoli express has been stopped, can not return goods.
不管怎么咨询客服，得到的始终是系统的自动回复。
No matter how you consult the customer service, you will always get an automatic reply from the system.
已被立案调查3月2日，广州市黄埔区市场监督管理局给记者提供了一份《关于投诉举报“广州云医惠药医药有限公司”涉嫌违法经营核查情况的说明》。
On March 2, the Huangpu District Market Supervision Bureau of Guangzhou provided a report on the investigation of illegal operation of Guangzhou Yunmei Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.
对于被举报“哄抬物价”情况，2020年2月1日该局派出执法人员前往被投诉人现场核查，暂未发现被投诉人有“哄抬物价”的行为，并依程序将相关检查情况回复投诉人。
With regard to the reported "price hike," on February 1, 2020, the bureau dispatched law enforcement officers to the person complained against to conduct on-site verification.

3月2日，健客网目前所属公司广州云医惠药医药有限公司针对被举报一事发布声明称，“高于市场价10倍卖口罩以及售卖三无产品等内容属于苏展等人故意捏造事实、搬弄是非严重破坏我公司正常生产经营的行为。
"The sale of face masks at 10 times the market price and the sale of three products are among the acts of the Soviet Union and others who deliberately fabricate facts and rumor and seriously undermine our company's normal production and operation," the statement said in response to the report.
政府相关执法部门早前在接到投诉后曾来我公司调查过，我公司已经配合执法部门提交了相关证明材料，执法部门已明确我公司经营行为合法合规。
The relevant law enforcement departments of the Government have come to our company to investigate complaints, our company has cooperated with law enforcement departments to submit relevant certification materials, the law enforcement departments have made clear that our company's operations are legal and legal.
”3月2日，谢方敏在接受记者采访时表示，口罩100%没有问题。
In an interview with reporters on March 2, Xie said 100 percent of the masks were in order.
“用我们初一到初六卖的口罩，跟其他平台没有调价的口罩进行对比，完全偷换了概念。
"Using our first six days of selling masks, and other platforms do not adjust the price of the mask comparison, completely stolen the concept.
现在市场监管局查了之后，完全没有问题。
Now that the market regulator has checked, there's nothing wrong with it.
既无价格问题，也无所谓三无问题，也无虚假宣传问题，结论都在这里。
There is no question of price, no problem of triviality, no false propaganda, and here is the conclusion.
所以，口罩是完全没有问题的。
So there is nothing wrong with the mask.
”值得关注的是，健客网声明和谢方敏都未对该公司已被黄埔区市场监督管理局立案调查一事做出回应。
Remarkably, neither the KJN statement nor Xie Fangmin responded to the fact that the company had been opened by the Huangpu District Market Surveillance Authority.
针对健客网所出现的问题，3月2日，广东明灿律师事务所的赵云帆律师告诉记者，从民事赔偿角度，如果认定健客网存在欺诈，则消费者可要求健客网按照《消费者权益保护法》规定退一赔三。
On March 2, Zhao Yun-fan, a lawyer at Guangdong's Ming can law firm, told reporters that from the point of view of civil compensation, consumers can request the HPN to return three to three in accordance with the Consumer Rights and Interests Protection Law.
从行政责任角度，因违反《产品质量法》，将面临罚款、没收违法所得的处罚，情节严重的还可能被吊销营业执照。
In terms of administrative liability, violation of the Product Quality Law will result in fines, confiscation of illegal gains and, in serious cases, revocation of business licenses.
从刑事责任角度，销售三无口罩或假口罩可能涉嫌构成生产销售伪劣产品罪、销售假冒商标的商品罪、生产销售不符合标准的医用器材罪的竞合，刑法规定是择一重罪处罚。
From the point of view of criminal responsibility, the sale of three masks or masks may constitute the crime of producing and selling fake and inferior products, the crime of selling counterfeit trade marks and the crime of producing and selling substandard medical equipment.
