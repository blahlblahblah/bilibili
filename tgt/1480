疫情将促进药品加快上市、同情用药等配套法规落地和完善作为美国吉利德公司的在研药物，瑞德西韦(remdisivir)最近被全球关注，近日有关新冠病毒药物的进展也在股市掀起热潮。
The epidemic is set to hasten the launch of drugs on the market, sympathy for drugs and the development of drugs under development at Geely, the US company that has recently gained global attention, and recent advances in new crown jewels have fueled a boom in the stock market.
从2月4日开始，中国卫生部门紧急联系吉利德开展相关临床试验，受此消息影响，吉利德股价连续两个交易日飘红，美股大涨接近20%。
Geely's share price has soared for two straight days and U.S. stocks have jumped nearly 20 percent on news that Chinese health authorities began emergency clinical trials in Jilid on Feb. 4.
2月12日，科创板上市的博瑞医药发布公告称，公司成功仿制开发了瑞德西韦原料药合成工艺技术和制剂技术，已批量生产出瑞德西韦原料药，瑞德西韦制剂批量化生产正在进行中。
On February 12, Boreal Pharmaceuticals, a board-listed company, announced that it had successfully imitated the Rhetsevir API synthesis process and formulation technology, that it had mass-produced Rhetsevir API and that mass production of Rhetsevir was under way.
当日，博瑞医药一字涨停，大涨20%，股价创2019年11月上市以来新高，其上涨带动A股医药股整体走高，表现强于大盘。
On the same day, the stock rose 20 per cent to a new high since it was listed in November 2019, pushing A-share medicine stocks as a whole higher than the market.
瑞德西韦何时能让患者得到使用，成为新冠肺炎患者和全社会关注的焦点。
When Rhetsevir will be available to patients has become the focus of attention of patients and the community as a whole.
仿制药品1月31日，《新英格兰医学杂志》发表了一篇论文，详细介绍了美国首例使用瑞德西韦治愈新冠肺炎的案例。
New England Journal of Medicine on Jan. 31 published a paper detailing the first case in the United States in which Rhetsevir was used to treat pneumonia in the New England Journal of Medicine.
业内专家认为，仅凭一个病例无法判断患者症状改善是否与瑞德西韦的使用有关，且急性病毒感染通常都具有自限性。
Industry experts believe that a single case alone does not determine whether the patient's symptoms have improved due to Rhetsevir use, and that acute viral infections are usually self-limited.
作为广谱抗病毒药物，由于在抑制埃博拉病毒的三期临床中效果不理想，该药在全球任何国家都尚未获得上市批准。
As a broad-spectrum antiviral drug, it has not been approved in any country in the world because of its unsatisfactory efficacy in suppressing the third phase of the Ebola virus.
因此，瑞德西韦究竟是不是“神药”，需等待临床研究数据支撑来验证其对新冠病毒的抑制作用。
So whether Rhetsevir is a "miracle drug" will have to wait for clinical data to confirm its inhibitory effect on the new crown virus.
医药领域对于专利的依赖性极强，在药品上市之前，药企必须要为产品配备上全方位的专利保护才能安心将其推入市场。
The pharmaceutical industry is highly dependent on patents. Before they go on the market, pharmaceutical companies must be equipped with the full range of patent protection to put them into the market.
成立于1987年的吉利德相关专利布局遍布全球，以美国、欧洲、日本、澳大利亚、加拿大等发达国家和地区最为密集，同时也广泛分布在发展中国家，如今稳居抗病毒领域霸主地位。
Founded in 1987, Gilead-related patent distribution throughout the world, with the United States, Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada and other developed countries and regions the most intensive, but also widely distributed in developing countries, now firmly dominant in the field of anti-virus.
吉利德科学全球副总裁、中国区总经理罗永庆曾表示，“吉利德不像传统的制药企业，更像是硅谷的高科技公司”。
"Geely is not like a traditional pharmaceutical company, it's more like a Silicon Valley high-tech company," says Luo Yung-ching, global vice president of Geely Science and general manager of China.
2月13日，博瑞医药发布股票交易异常波动公告称，公司关注到有媒体报道或市场传闻，公司开发瑞德西韦涉嫌侵犯专利权。
The company is concerned about media reports or market rumors that it is exploiting Rhettigrew's patent rights, the company said on Feb. 13.
截至目前，公司关于瑞德西韦的开发工作尚处于研发阶段，公司认为上述研发事宜不存在侵犯专利权的情形。
So far, the company's development work on Rhetsevier is still in the research and development stage, the company does not think that the above-mentioned research and development there is no patent infringement.
博瑞医药提示风险称，如果瑞德西韦的临床试验结果不理想，则其仿制技术就无重大价值可言；即使瑞德西韦临床试验成功，产品上市需经吉利德授权、药物临床、审批等环节，过程将存在重大不确定性。
The risk is that Rhetsevir's imitation technology would be of little value if its clinical trials were not satisfactory, and that even if Rhetsevier's clinical trials were successful, the product would need to be licensed, clinically approved and approved by Geely, and there would be significant uncertainty.
那么，我国药企目前能否对瑞德西韦进行仿制？仿制药是与原研药具有相同的活性成分、剂型、给药途径和治疗作用的药品。
So, can Chinese pharmaceutical companies copy Rhetsevir at present? Generic drugs have the same active ingredients, dosage forms, delivery routes and therapeutic effects as the original drugs.
国务院办公厅日前印发《关于开展仿制药质量和疗效一致性评价的意见》，要求化学药品新注册分类实施前批准上市的仿制药，凡未按照与原研药品质量和疗效一致原则审批的，均须开展一致性评价。
The General Office of the State Council recently issued the Opinions on the Evaluation of Quality and Efficacy of Generic Drugs, which requires that all generic drugs approved for marketing before the implementation of the new registration classification must be evaluated for consistency if they are not approved in accordance with the principle of consistency with the quality and efficacy of the original research drugs.
进行质量和疗效的一致性评价，就是要求对已经批准上市的仿制药品，在质量和疗效上与原研药能够一致，在临床上与原研药可以相互替代，这样有利于节约社会的医药费用。
Evaluation of the consistency of quality and efficacy requires that generic drugs that have been approved for marketing should be of the same quality and efficacy as the original drugs, and that they can be substituted clinically with the original ones, thus contributing to the savings in the cost of medicines to society.
中专隆天知识产权运营（深圳）股份有限公司项目总监、高级专利代理师李瑞丰在接受中国新闻周刊采访时表示，虽然针对冠状病毒适应症的专利尚未在中国获得国家知识产权局的授权，但药物能发挥作用，与其结构密切相关。
In an interview with China News Weekly Li Ruifeng, project director and senior patent agent for Zhongzhong Longtian Intellectual Property Operation (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. said that although the patent for the coronavirus indication has not yet been licensed by the State Intellectual Property Office in China, the drugs can play a role and are closely related to its structure.
“由于其核心化合专利在中国已获得授权且有效，根据中国专利法第60条的规定：未经专利权人许可，进行制造、使用、许诺销售、销售、进口其专利产品，属于专利侵权行为。
"Since its core chemical patent is authorized and valid in China, it is a patent infringement act to manufacture, use, promise to sell, sell or import the patented product without the permission of the patentee," according to Article 60 of the Chinese Patent Law.
因此，中国药企需要获得美国吉利德公司的许可方能生产该结构的药物化合物。
As a result, Chinese pharmaceutical companies need a license from the United States company Geely to produce the structural drug compounds.
”李瑞丰指出，目前我国药企尚不能针对瑞德西韦进行仿制药申报，但现阶段我国药企是可以开始着手准备“仿制”的，就像2005年流感大暴发时，为了避免专利权被强制许可，罗氏制药主动允许上药集团在可能来临的流感大暴发时生产奥司他韦，随后又授权了东阳光公司。
Li pointed out that Chinese pharmaceutical companies were not yet in a position to declare generic drugs against Rhetsevir, but that at this stage Chinese pharmaceutical companies could start preparing "imitations," just as Roche voluntarily allowed the pharmaceutical group to produce oseltamivir in the event of a possible influenza pandemic, and then authorized East Sunshine.
同情用药2月1日，国家卫生健康委员会专家组表示已联系美国吉利德公司引入瑞德西韦，并为其申请绿色通道。
Compassion drugs Feb. 1, the National Health Council panel said it had contacted Geely Corp. of the United States to introduce Rhettigrew and apply for a green channel.
2月2日，国家药品监督管理局药品审评中心网站显示，瑞德西韦在我国的临床试验申请已获得受理。
On February 2, the website of the Drug Review Center of the State Administration of Pharmacy showed that Rhetsevier's application for clinical trials in China had been accepted.
据新华社报道，瑞德西韦在我国直接进入的是临床试验III期，已有共计761例新冠肺炎患者将加入试验组，试验将在武汉金银潭医院等多家临床一线接诊新冠肺炎患者的医院中进行，首批新冠肺炎重症患者已于2月6日接受用药。
A total of 761 new cases of pneumonia will be added to the trial group, with the first cases of severe pneumonia on February 6, according to the Xinhua News Agency.
2月13日，国家知识产权局召开党组会议暨局应对新冠肺炎疫情工作领导小组会议，会议强调，要积极支持企业复工复产和新项目开工建设，对复工复产企业和新建项目涉及防治新冠肺炎的专利、商标申请注册开辟“绿色通道”，加快办理效率；要指导和支持企业运用知识产权进行质押融资，缓解资金困难。
On February 13, the State Intellectual Property Office held a meeting of the leading group meeting of the Bureau to deal with the SARS epidemic. The meeting stressed the need to actively support enterprises to resume production and start new projects.
柯杰律师事务所合伙人张方认为，根据一般的药品上市程序，创新药从研发到上市需经历临床前研究、I期、II期、III期临床试验以及上市生产审批等程序，需数年甚至数十年时间。
According to Zhang Fang, a partner at Kogye Law Firm, the process of pre-clinical research, phase I, phase II and phase III clinical trials, as well as market approval of innovative drugs from R & D to market, would take years or even decades, according to Zhang Fang, a partner at Kogye Law Firm.
即便像瑞德西韦直接进入III期临床试验，完成临床试验和上市生产审批程序也需数月甚至几年时间，因此通过特别程序加快药品上市尤为必要。
Even if a clinical trial like Rhetsevir enters phase III directly, it will take months or even years to complete clinical trials and market approval procedures, making it all the more necessary to speed up the marketing of drugs through special procedures.
国家市场监督管理总局2019年12月10日发布的《药品注册管理办法（征求意见稿）》专章对药品加快上市程序进行了规定，包括特别审批、附条件批准、优先审评审批及突破性治疗药物四种程序，本次疫情显然构成其适用的典型情景。
The Measures on the Administration of Drug Registration (Exposure Draft) promulgated by the State Administration of Market Supervision and Administration on December 10, 2019 prescribe the procedures for accelerating the market listing of pharmaceuticals, including four procedures: special approval, conditional approval, priority review and approval, and breakthrough drugs.
关于瑞德西韦正式进入中国市场的时间，李瑞丰表示，如果临床试验风险获益明显，那么该品种的上市申请推测可能最快6月份获批。
Regarding the timing of Rhetsevier's entry into the Chinese market, Li said that if there were significant risk benefits from clinical trials, it could be possible to get approval as early as June.
虽然国家药监局特事特办加速审批，但并非降低评审标准，能否最终获批还要基于得到的安全有效性数据进行全面评价。
Although the Office of the State Administration of Pharmaceutical Supervision and Administration to expedite the approval, but not lower the evaluation criteria, whether the final approval will be based on the safety and effectiveness of the data to conduct a comprehensive evaluation.
值得一提的是，对于急需使用瑞德西韦的患者来说，除了加入临床试验组获得用药机会，另一种可能的途径则是同情用药，其最早起源于美国，是指在特殊情况下对未参与临床试验的患者使用临床试验中的药物，这种方式多属个例。
It is worth mentioning that, for patients in urgent need of Rhetsevir, in addition to access to medication in the clinical trial group, the other possible route is compassionate medication, which originated in the United States and refers to the use of drugs in clinical trials, often on an exceptional basis, for patients not involved in clinical trials.
瑞德西韦尚未在全球上市，美国患者通过同情用药接受治疗。
Rhetsevier is not yet on the global market and American patients are being treated with sympathetic medication.
吉利德方面表示，为了应对埃博拉疫情，吉利德扩大了瑞德西韦的生产，增加了原材料库存，以满足同情用药及在中国临床试验的需求，目前正通过内部制造和外部伙伴合作补充产能。
In response to the Ebola outbreak, Geely has expanded production in Radesiveh and increased raw-material stocks to meet the need for sympathetic drugs and clinical trials in China, Gillider said, adding capacity through in-house manufacturing and external partnerships.
那么，中国能否也采用同情用药方式治疗新冠肺炎患者？张方指出，我国现行有效的法律法规亦有同情用药的相关规定，但《新药法》和《药物临床试验质量管理规范》都是十分原则性的规定，同情用药的细则性规定虽有出台，但尚未正式生效。
Zhang Fang pointed out that the current laws and regulations in force in China also contain provisions on sympathetic drug use, but both the New Drug Law and the Standards for Quality Control of Clinical Trials of Drugs are very principled provisions.
因细则性规定的缺失，同情用药在具体适用时的申请人条件、审批程序等许多问题仍有待进一步明确。
Due to the lack of detailed regulations, many issues such as the applicant's condition and examination and approval procedure in the specific application of sympathetic medicine still need to be further clarified.
由于同情用药使用的是尚未批准上市的临床试验用药物，其安全性和有效性都尚未最终确定，因此其适用应十分审慎。
The safety and efficacy of sympathetic use of drugs for clinical trials that have not yet been approved for the market have not yet been finalized and should therefore be applied with great caution.
张方认为，本次疫情中，加快上市和同情用药是否会适用以及如何得到适用非常值得关注。
Zhang Fang believes that in this epidemic, whether and how to speed up the market and sympathy medicine will be of great concern.
如果瑞德西韦能在临床试验中证明其在治疗新冠肺炎方面的效用和价值，不排除在本次疫情中，为了挽救重危患者，在规定尚有待完善的情况下，先行探索同情用药的实践，扩大适用到非受试者的急需患者，为日后相关规定的完善提供指导或参考。
If Rhetsevir can prove its efficacy and value in treating new crown pneumonia in clinical trials, it should not be ruled out that in this case, in order to save critically ill patients, the practice of compassionate medication should be explored first to extend it to patients in urgent need of non-subjects and provide guidance or reference for further improvement of the relevant regulations.
本次疫情将促进和加速药品加快上市、同情用药等方面配套法规的落地和完善。
This epidemic situation will promote and accelerate the rapid marketing of drugs, sympathetic medicine and other aspects of supporting legislation landing and improvement.
