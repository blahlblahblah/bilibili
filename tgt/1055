”在全球严阵以待、合力抗击新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情时，有一片大陆尤其绷紧了神经。
One continent, in particular, is nervous as the world prepares to fight the new coronavirus pneumonia.
迄今为止，非洲54个国家还未发现新冠肺炎确诊病例，但世卫组织在非洲的紧急行动负责人米歇尔·姚（Michel Yao）已发出警告，病例确诊只是时间问题，疫情“随时”会出现。
So far, 54 countries in Africa have not detected confirmed cases of pneumonia, but Michel Yao, WHO's head of emergency operations in Africa, has warned that it is only a matter of time before a case is diagnosed and that an outbreak "occurs" at any time.
之所以这样说，是因为非洲目前的病毒检测能力仍相对有限，而非洲与疫情国家之间，又存在着大量的人员交流。
This is due to the fact that the current virus detection capacity in Africa is still relatively limited and that there is a significant exchange of personnel between Africa and the affected countries.
据《卫报》12日报道，截至上周，非洲只有包括塞内加尔的巴斯德研究所（Institut Pasteur）、南非的国家传染病研究所（National Institute for Communicable Diseases）在内的6个实验室有能力检测新冠病毒。
As of last week, only six laboratories in Africa, including the Institut Pasteur in Senegal and the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa, had the capacity to test for the new cap virus, The Guardian reported Wednesday.
此前，非洲共向世卫组织报告了45例疑似病例，主要来自埃塞尔比亚、肯尼亚、科特迪瓦、加纳、博茨瓦纳等国。
Africa had previously reported a total of 45 suspected cases to WHO, mainly from Ethiopia, Kenya, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana and Botswana.
其中，已有35例经检测呈阴性，还有10例正在隔离、等待检测。
Of these, 35 have been tested negative, and 10 are being quarantined for testing.
这让外界开始担忧，非洲是否已经出现了未被发现的病例。
That has raised concerns about whether there have been undetected cases in Africa.
伦敦卫生与热带医学院院长彼得·皮奥（Peter Piot）上周就曾提出，非洲“不可避免”地会出现病例，但出乎意料的是，在亚洲、欧洲、美洲都相继暴发疫情后，非洲仍一例都没有。
As Peter Piot, dean of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, suggested last week that there would be "inevitable" cases in Africa, but, unexpectedly, none in Africa after outbreaks in Asia, Europe, and the Americas.
葛兰素史克疫苗（GSK Vaccines）的流行病学家及首席医学官托马斯·布鲁尔（Thomas Breuer）也认为，至今未看到非洲报告确诊病例，“这肯定不是事实”。
Thomas Breuer, an epidemiologist and chief medical officer for GSK Vaccines, agrees that "it is certainly not true" that no confirmed cases have been reported in Africa.
据《金融时报》5日报道，世卫组织区域办事处早前已指出，有13个非洲国家面临的风险尤其大，主要因为它们与疫情严重国家的人员往来频繁，如阿尔及利亚、安哥拉、埃塞俄比亚、加纳、尼日利亚、坦桑尼亚和赞比亚等。
As reported earlier in the Financial Times 5 report, 13 African countries are at particular risk, mainly because of their frequent interactions with countries with severe epidemics, such as Algeria, Angola, Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania and Zambia.
以埃塞俄比亚为例，该国拥有非洲最大的航空公司埃塞俄比亚航空（下称“埃航”）。
Consider Ethiopia, which has the largest airline in Africa, Ethiopian Airlines (EAL).
据非洲新闻台11日报道，埃航每周有35趟航班飞往中国的5个目的地（北京、上海、香港、广州、成都），每天平均搭载4000名中国旅客往来两国，其中70%的旅客在抵达该国首都机场后，还会前往其他非洲国家。
Air China flies 35 flights a week to five destinations in China (Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Guangzhou and Chengdu), carrying an average of 4,000 Chinese passengers a day to and from the two countries, 70 percent of whom will travel to other African countries after arriving at the country's capital.
此前，出于对疫情蔓延的担忧，肯尼亚航空（Kenya Airways）、南非航空（South African Airways）等6家非洲航空公司都已暂停了往来中国的航班。
Earlier, six African airlines, including Kenya Airways and South African Airways, had suspended flights to and from China amid concerns about the spread of the epidemic.
不过，埃航一直都坚持表示，停航无法中断疫情的传播，埃航将“患难与共”。
However, EAL has always insisted that the suspension would not interrupt the spread of the epidemic and that EAL would "share weal and woe."
埃航首席执行官特沃德（Tewolde Gebremariam）说，世卫组织原本就告诉大家，停航无济于事，毕竟其他国家都已经出现了病例，最重要的应该是在机场加强防范措施，而不是去孤立和隔离。
EAL chief executive Tewolde Gebremariam said the World Health Organization had told everyone that a halt would not help. After all, other countries have already had cases, and the most important thing is to strengthen preventive measures at airports, not to isolate and isolate.
埃航加强相关航班的消毒工作不过，非洲国家卫生系统的薄弱还是不免让外界产生担忧。
Air China has stepped up efforts to disinfect flights, but the weakness of health systems in African countries has raised concerns.
尽管非洲在经历了埃博拉疫情后，已经拥有了一定的防疫设施和经验，也已加强了整个非洲入境口岸的筛查工作，但这并不代表非洲已经“准备好”应对新冠肺炎疫情。
Although Africa has acquired some immunization facilities and experience following the Ebola outbreak, and has stepped up screening at ports of entry across Africa, this does not mean that Africa is "ready" to deal with the outbreak.
若仅讨论死亡率，埃博拉的严重性显然要比新冠肺炎可怕得多，其平均病死率约为50%，在以往疫情中出现的病死率从25%到90%不等。
When mortality is considered alone, the severity of Ebola is clearly much worse than that of new crown pneumonia, with an average fatality rate of about 50%, ranging from 25% to 90% in previous outbreaks.
但埃博拉病毒主要通过接触传染，患者一般症状明显，而新冠病毒还可以通过飞沫传播，即使是无症状者也具备传染性。
But Ebola is transmitted mainly through contact, with patients typically showing obvious symptoms, while the new cap virus can spread in droplets, making even asymptomatic people infectious.
世卫组织在非洲的紧急行动负责人米歇尔·姚表示，如今非洲面临的挑战主要是检测试剂的缺乏，以及医院的收治能力有限。
Michel Yao, head of the WHO emergency operation in Africa, said that the main challenges facing Africa today were the lack of detection reagents and the limited capacity of hospitals to treat them.
他说，试剂的缺乏正在拖延非洲国家的确诊速度。
He says the lack of reagents is slowing the rate of diagnosis in African countries.
此前，出现疑似病例的非洲国家大多是将检测样本送至塞内加尔、南非等国，甚至还有国家将样本送到了巴黎。
Previously, most African countries with suspected cases sent samples to countries such as Senegal and South Africa, and even sent samples to Paris.
与此同时，非洲的多数医院都没有能力接收大量重症患者。
At the same time, most hospitals in Africa do not have the capacity to receive large numbers of critically ill patients.
“除了肯尼亚、南非等大国，多数国家的重症监护医疗设施都很有限，”米歇尔·姚说，“一家医院可能只有10个床位可以满足重症监护条件。
"With the exception of large countries like Kenya and South Africa, most countries have limited intensive care facilities," Yao said. "A hospital may have only 10 beds for intensive care.
要是出现了大量重症患者，那将会是一个很大的挑战。
It would be a big challenge if there were a lot of serious cases.
”世卫组织突发卫生事件规划执行主任迈克尔·瑞恩（Michael Ryan）在周一的新闻发布会上已指出，“考虑到90%至100%的病人需要辅助供氧，20%至25%的病人需要重症监护，5%至10%的病人需要使用机械手段辅助或代替自主呼吸，那将会给卫生系统带来极大压力。
As Michael Ryan, WHO's executive director of health emergency planning, pointed out at a press conference on Monday, "considering that 90% to 100% of patients need supplementary oxygen, 20% to 25% of patients require intensive care, and 5% to 10% of patients require mechanical aids or replacement of spontaneous respiration, which would put enormous strain on the health system.
”因此，米歇尔·姚表示，非洲国家接下来的防疫工作重点，仍然是尽早发现病例，遏制疫情传播。
So the next priority for African countries is to detect cases early and stop the spread of the disease, Michelle Yao said.
非洲疾控中心称，截至11日，所有疑似病例都已完成检测，结果均为阴性非洲疾控中心（Africa CDC）表示，目前各地的医疗中心都正处于“高度戒备”状态。
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Africa said all suspected cases had been tested as of November and negative African CDC said health centres were on "high alert" around the world.
据悉，本周，有能力检测新冠病毒的非洲国家已增至15个，包括上述几个面临较大风险的国家。
This week, the number of African countries able to test for the new strain of the virus has risen to 15, including several at-risk countries.
接下来，还会有更多检测实验室将在其他非洲国家建立运转。
Next, more testing laboratories will be set up in other African countries.
世卫组织则正在向非洲29家实验室运送诊断用具。
WHO is transporting diagnostic kits to 29 laboratories in Africa.
上个周末，非洲疾控中心也在塞内加尔为15个国家的科学家举办了一个研习班，向他们分发了包括检测试剂在内的诊断工具。
Last weekend, the African Centre for Disease Control and Prevention also organized a workshop in Senegal for scientists from 15 countries, to whom diagnostic tools, including detection reagents, were distributed.
非洲疾控中心主任约翰·肯格松（John Nkengasong）表示，下周，南非还将为其他25个国家举办培训。
John Nkengasong, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Africa, said South Africa would hold training for 25 other countries next week.
肯格松说，确实存在检测设施不足导致还未发现病例的说法，而检测能力的提升，将会鼓励更多出现疑似症状的人向医疗机构报告病情。
Kengeson says there are allegations that inadequate testing facilities have led to undetected cases, and that improved detection will encourage more people with suspected symptoms to report cases to health-care facilities.
“如果能将周转时间的单位从‘天’缩短至‘小时’，那出现疑似症状的人就会更有可能报告病情，接受检测，”肯格松说，“但如果要将一个人隔离数天，人们就会倾向于不报告。
"If the turnaround time could be shortened from 'days' to 'hours, people with suspected symptoms would be more likely to report the condition and be tested," Kengeson said. "But if a person is isolated for a few days, people tend not to report it.
如今，非洲已有很多国家有能力检测病毒，或许在接下来的几个星期，就会出现确诊病例。
Many countries in Africa now have the capacity to detect the virus, and there may be confirmed cases in the next few weeks.
时间会给出答案。
Time will tell.
”而针对医院收治能力有限的问题，米歇尔·姚则表示，无国界医生（Médecins Sans Frontières）、撒马利亚救援会（Samaritan's Purse）等非政府组织（NGO）正在提供搭建治疗中心所需的技术帮助，本周也还将举办一场地区合作伙伴之间的电话会议。
In response to the limited capacity of hospitals, Michelle Yao says non-governmental organizations such as Médecins Sans Frontières, Samaritan & aposs; s Purse are providing the technical help they need to set up treatment centers, and will host a conference call with regional partners this week.
“如果有大量病例出现，我们希望NGO可以帮助增加收治能力，提供氧气瓶、呼吸机等设备。
"If there is a large number of cases, we hope the NGO can help increase capacity by providing equipment such as oxygen cylinders and respirators."
他们有能力在短时间内部署治疗中心，”米歇尔·姚说。
They have the ability to deploy treatment centers at short notice, "Yao said.
