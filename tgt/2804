据美国《纽约时报》汇总各州公共卫生部门公布的新冠肺炎确诊病例，截至当地时间5日下午，全美已有163例确诊病例，分布在18个州。
The New York Times, which compiles confirmed cases of pneumonia reported by state public health departments, had 163 confirmed cases in 18 states as of the afternoon of May 5, local time.
华盛顿州公共卫生部门5日公布了一例死亡病例，使得全美死亡病例达到了12例。
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The state's Department of Public Health on Monday reported one death, bringing the national death toll to 12.
数据显示，美国的死亡率高达6.96%，这已是世界平均水平（3.4%）的两倍多，甚至远高于中国。
The U.S. has a 6.96 percent fatality rate, more than double the world average of 3.4 percent, and well above that of China.
全球确诊新冠肺炎病死率3.4%？特朗普：“我看就不到1%”WHO总干事谭德赛3日曾介绍，目前全球已有3.4%的新冠肺炎报告病例死亡，高于之前预测的2.1%。
3.4% of newly diagnosed cases of pneumonia worldwide Trump: "I don't think it's more than 1%," WHO Director-General Theresa Tanner said Wednesday, adding that 3.4% of reported new cases of pneumonia worldwide have died, up from 2.1% as previously forecast.
他还特别强调了肺炎与季节性流感的不同，后者致死率一般不到1%。
He also highlighted the difference between pneumonia and seasonal flu, which typically kills less than 1% of the population.
而新冠肺炎还没有疫苗，感染数和重症数都会增加。
There is no vaccine for new crown pneumonia, and the number of infections and severe cases increases.
然而，世卫组织刚刚公布全球确诊新冠肺炎3.4%的病死率，特朗普却凭“直觉”公开叫板：假的。
Yet, just after the WHO announced a 3.4% global fatality rate for newly diagnosed pneumonia, Trump is publicly calling it "intuitively" false.
“我看就不到1%。
"I don't think it's more than 1 percent.
”还把新冠肺炎说成“新冠流感”。
The new crown pneumonia has also been dubbed "New Crown Influenza."
当地时间4日晚上，特朗普接受福克斯新闻网电话采访，向主持人肖恩·汉尼吐槽WHO发布的数字“很假”，还把新冠肺炎说成“新冠流感，并表示现在公布的感染病例死亡率太高了，很多人感染后根本不需要就医，正常工作就能痊愈。
In a telephone interview with Fox News on the night of Thursday, Trump told anchorman Sean Hannibal WHO that the figures were "fake" and described the new crown pneumonia as "New Crown Influenza," saying that the reported death rate from infections is too high and that many people do not need to seek medical attention to recover from the infection.
数据显示，美国的死亡率高达6.96%，这已是世界平均水平（3.4%）的两倍多，甚至远高于中国。
The U.S. has a 6.96 percent fatality rate, more than double the world average of 3.4 percent, and well above that of China.
目前，美国11例新冠肺炎死亡病例全部分布在西海岸的华盛顿州（10例）和加利福尼亚州（1例）。
So far, all 11 deaths from pneumonia in the United States have occurred in Washington State (10 cases) and California (1 case) on the west coast.
而这两个州也已经相继宣布进入紧急状态。
A state of emergency has been declared in both states.
美国本土出现疫情以来，特朗普从最初保证“准备万全、风险非常低”，到指责民主党与媒体“夸大疫情、恐慌市场”，再到承认局势“可能会变更糟”、询问“两个月内能否造出疫苗”，最后变成把美国病毒检测能力不足“甩锅”给前任奥巴马。
Since the outbreak in the US proper, Trump has gone from initially promising "security and very low risk," to blaming the Democrats and the media for "exaggerating the epidemic, panicking the markets," to admitting that the situation "could change for the worse," asking "whether a vaccine can be built in two months," and eventually turning US virus-detection capabilities into a cauldron for former Obama.
早就对他表现不满的美国民众，进一步拿这番表态开刷。
The long-disgruntled American public has gone one step further.
美媒Vox记者阿隆·鲁帕尔形容特朗普的说法“令人震惊地不负责任”，称他根本不知道新冠肺炎与流感的区别。
US-based Vox journalist Arun Rupal described Trump's remarks as "shockingly irresponsible," saying that he had no idea of the difference between pneumonia and flu.
美国国家过敏和传染病研究所所长福西也曾提醒特朗普，新冠肺炎“比传统的流感更致命”。
Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has also reminded Trump that pneumonia is "more deadly than conventional flu."
截至当地时间5日下午，全美已有163例确诊病例，分布在18个州。
By the afternoon of May 5, local time, 163 cases had been confirmed nationwide, spread across 18 states.
随着疫情的扩散，美国多个州也相继出台了应对措施。
As the epidemic spread, a number of states in the United States have also launched a response.
加利福尼亚州4日宣布进入“紧急状态”。
California declared a state of emergency Thursday.
美国疾控中心当天宣布扩大新冠病毒检测对象的范围，医生可根据临床诊断来决定病人是否需要进行核酸检测。
CDC announced the same day to expand the range of new crown virus test subjects, doctors can be based on clinical diagnosis to determine whether patients need a nucleic acid test.
美国再次放宽新冠病毒检测条件美国疾病控制和预防中心4日宣布，再次放宽接受新冠病毒检测的条件，允许出现发烧、咳嗽和呼吸困难等症状的患者在医生批准后接受新冠病毒核酸检测。
US to Relax New Crown Virus Test Condition US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced Thursday that it would relax the conditions for testing for the new crown virus, allowing patients suffering from fever, cough and breathing difficulties to undergo a new crown virus nucleic acid test with the approval of a doctor.
美国卫生与公众服务部部长亚历克斯·阿扎4日接受媒体采访时说，美疾控中心本周发送的核酸检测盒可对7.5万人进行检测，美疾控中心的合同商正向医院和实验室运送的检测盒可进行超过100万次检测。
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is sending 75,000 nucleic acid test kits this week, and CDC contractors are sending more than one million tests to hospitals and laboratories, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in an interview with reporters Thursday.
美国加利福尼亚州政府4日宣布，全州进入紧急状态以应对新冠肺炎疫情。
California authorities on Thursday declared a state of emergency in response to the outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia.
根据通告，进入紧急状态后，加州政府将能够根据应急法规和预案，更方便地获取相关物资，确保县市政府共享信息，以加强防控疫情。
According to the circular, the state government will be able to improve access to supplies under emergency regulations and plans and ensure that county and municipal governments share information in order to strengthen control of the epidemic.
加州进入紧急状态的一个重要原因是，4日上午加州出现了首个死亡病例。
An important reason for California's state of emergency was the first case of death in California on the morning of Thursday.
这个病例曾乘坐“至尊公主”号轮船，这艘船目前在驶往旧金山途中，据称船上已有21人出现感染症状。
The case was aboard the MV Princess Supreme, which was en route to San Francisco and reported 21 people on board with symptoms of infection.
加州政府现已命令该船不得入港，将派遣应急人员登船检测。
The state government has ordered the ship not to enter the port and will send emergency personnel on board for testing.
根据加州政府公布的最新数字，截至4日晚，加州共有53个新冠肺炎感染病例，超过9400人处于居家隔离状态。
California had 53 new cases of pneumonia and more than 9,400 people were in quarantine as of Thursday night, according to new figures released by the state government.
外媒：美国疫情数据有误，可能遗漏大量感染病例美国《大西洋月刊》网站3日的一篇报道认为，由于美国疾病控制和预防中心只关注入境旅客、筛查输入型病例，没有扩大检测范围，可能遗漏大量感染病例。
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is focused on incoming passengers, screening imported cases and failing to expand coverage, leaving out a large number of infections, according to a report online Wednesday on the Atlantic Monthly Bulletin.
文章说，美国目前已出现非输入型病例，证明疫情进入“社区传播”阶段。
The article said that the United States has now appeared non-imported cases, evidence of the epidemic has entered the "community transmission" stage.
位于华盛顿州西雅图的弗雷德·哈钦森癌症研究中心计算生物学家特雷弗·贝德福德称，“有力证据”表明，新冠病毒至少已在华盛顿州传播数周。
Trevor Bedford, a computational biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington, says there is "strong evidence" that the new crown virus has been circulating in Washington state for at least a few weeks.
然而，全美已接受检测的人数非常有限。
However, the number of people tested nationwide is very limited.
文章指出，当其他国家采取大规模措施防控疫情时，美国公共卫生部门一边盯着表面数据说疫情极可能在美国传播，一边在原地踏步。
The article points out that when other countries take large-scale measures to prevent and control the epidemic, the U. S. public health department, while staring at the surface data, says the epidemic is likely to spread in the United States while standing still.
法国《回声报》日前在报道中提到，美国现阶段新冠病毒检测措施不力。
The French newspaper Echo recently reported that the United States at this stage of the new crown virus detection measures are inadequate.
美国疾控中心大规模检测行动的开展滞后于疫情发展。
The development of large-scale CDC detection lags behind the epidemic.
美国疾控中心使用的试剂盒还被证实有缺陷，需要紧急生产新产品。
The kits used by the CDC were also found to be defective, requiring the urgent production of new products.
报道指出，美国的检测效率也令人不满，目前韩国日均检测1万人次，而美国日均检测数量仅为数百人次。
Tests in the United States are also unsatisfactory, with an average of 10,000 tests a day in South Korea compared with an average of hundreds in the United States, the report said.
美国官方至今未公布可供民众前往并进行检测的医疗机构名单。
So far, U.S. officials have not published a list of medical facilities accessible to the public for testing.
此外，美国高昂的医疗费用可能成为新冠病毒防控的一大障碍。
In addition, the high cost of health care in the United States could be a major barrier to new crown virus control.
不少民众可能会因为担心高昂的检测和治疗费用而选择延后报告或隐瞒症状。
Many people may choose to delay reporting or conceal symptoms for fear of high testing and treatment costs.
