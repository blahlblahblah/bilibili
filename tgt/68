“人如果在家里死了，是留不下这个人的记录的，没人知道他是因为肺炎死的。
'If a man dies at home, there is no record of him; no one knows that he died of pneumonia.
”口述 | 李雪（化名）记者 | 张从志床位极度紧缺▲▲▲父亲今年64岁，武汉人，公务员退休。
Ricky Li (not his real name) & nbsp; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45
从1月17日确认感染后，他的食欲变得非常差，几乎吃不下任何东西，每天傍晚五六点就开始发烧，最高烧到38.3℃以上，吃药后有所缓解，但第二天又会继续发烧。
After confirmation of the infection on 17 January, his appetite became so poor that he could hardly eat anything. Every evening he developed a fever, reaching a peak of more than 38.3 degrees Celsius.
捱到了昨天（1月22日）早上，越来越严重。
By yesterday morning (January 22), it was getting worse and worse.
我赶紧叫了出租车让他们去了汉口医院。
I hastened to call a taxi and let them go to Hankou Hospital.
我妈一进医院就拍了个视频给我，在发热门诊排队的人已有几百个。
As soon as my mother entered the hospital, I got a video of hundreds of people queuing up at the fever clinic.
因为人实在太多了，中途他们又打车去了另一家非定点医院，想先去拍个片看一下。
Because there were so many people, they took a taxi to another non-designated hospital and wanted to take a picture first.
片子一出来，双肺全部感染，片子上已从第一次检查的几个阴影点发展成大片的阴影。
As soon as the film came out, both lungs were infected and the film had developed from the first few shades of the examination into a large shadow.
做完检查，他们又马上折返汉口医院。
After the inspection, they immediately turned back to Hankou Hospital.
好不容易排到了，医生说现在我爸这个情况打针也没用，必须住院，但医院腾不出床位了，他建议赶紧去武汉市第七医院（以下简称“七院”），因为那里马上要开新的床位。
Finally, the doctor said my father this situation is useless, had to be hospitalized, but the hospital can not spare beds, he recommended hastening to Wuhan City Seventh Hospital (hereinafter referred to as "the seventh hospital"), because new beds will be opened there soon.
去七院之前，我又听说武昌医院新开了500张床位，他们就先去了武昌医院。
Before going to the seventh hospital, I heard that Wuchang Hospital opened 500 new beds, they went to Wuchang Hospital first.
晚上七点到的时候，我妈说急诊室里连医生都看不到了，所有人都在大厅等。
By 7 p. m., my mom said the emergency room was out of sight of the doctors, and everyone was waiting in the lobby.
当时医院门诊大楼前面有五六辆120急救车拉了人过来，有医生出来跟急救车说不能再往医院送人了，他们顾不上来了。
There were five or six 120 ambulances in front of the hospital's outpatient building and a doctor came out to tell the ambulance that they could not give anyone away.
1月22日晚上，武汉市第七医院门口排队的人群。
On the evening of January 22, a crowd lined up at the gate of Wuhan 7th Hospital.
我妈看这情形，又连忙打车带我爸往七院赶。
My mother saw this situation, and quickly took a taxi to take my father to the seventh courtyard.
本来公布的消息，七院是第二天一早才新开床位，她实在等不了了，想去碰个运气。
It had been announced that the hospital had only opened its bed the next morning, and she could not wait to take a chance.
晚上9:20左右到七院大门口，我妈又给我拍了一段视频，说前面已经排了40多个人，这下她也不敢回家了。
Around 9: 20 pm to the gate of the seven courtyard, my mother took another video for me, said that the front has been lined up more than 40 people, under this she did not dare to go home.
七院新开的床位只有300张，如果等到明天早上，她说肯定进不去了。
There were only 300 new beds in the seven, and if she waited until morning, she said she would not be able to get in.
到晚上10:00左右，我妈告诉我，她后面已经至少排了100多人，还有人陆续到来。
By about 10 p. m., my mother told me that there were at least 100 people in line behind her, and others were arriving.
10:40左右，医院开了一扇门，一次只让进三个人，进去的人先查血，如果严重就收，不严重的依然不能收。
At about 1040 hours, the hospital opened a door to admit only three people at a time. Those who entered first checked blood, and if it was serious, those who were not serious could not be collected.
我爸爸折腾了一天，病了以后就几乎没吃东西，那时已经走不动路了，他几年之前还做过心脏支架手术。
My dad, who toiled all day, ate almost nothing when he was ill. He couldn't walk anymore. He had heart scaffolds a few years ago.
我要在家带孩子，也不能出去。
I'm bringing up the kids at home. I can't go out.
我今天在家哭了一天，真的忍不住想，万一人哪一瞬间没了，该怎么办？不少患者在家隔离▲▲▲爸爸是在今年1月17日出现不适：发烧，头疼，浑身酸胀，当时以为只是感冒，睡一觉就好了。
I cried at home today, really can not help but think, in case the person did not have a moment, how to do? A lot of patients at home on January 17: a fever, headache, all over the sour, thought was just a cold, sleep good.
第二天早上起来，症状却更严重了。
The next morning the symptoms got worse.
当时我就有点警觉，因为武汉在闹肺炎，我说带他到医院去看一下，他还不愿，觉得只是普通感冒，也没别的症状。
At that time, I was a bit alert, because Wuhan was suffering from pneumonia, I said to take him to the hospital to see, he did not want to, just feel that the common cold, and no other symptoms.
最后拗不过，1月18日晚上，我带他到了武汉市第三医院急诊科。
Finally, on January 18 night, I took him to Wuhan Third Hospital Emergency Department.
一去，医生直接让我们先去拍CT，后查血项。
One time, the doctor asked us to take a CT first, and then check the blood items.
检查做完，医生一看片子说了一句——“他也有”，就是被感染了。
After the examination, the doctor saw the film said - "He also has", is infected.
片子上，我爸的一边肺叶出现了两个阴影点。
On the film, my dad had two shaded spots on one side of his lobe.
医生说他们医院接收不了，只能第二天带着结果去武昌，那边有湖北省人民医院和武汉中南医院开了发热门诊。
Doctors said they could not accept the hospital, only the next day with the results to Wuchang, there is Hubei Province People's Hospital and Wuhan Central South Hospital opened a fever clinic.
这两家医院人平时都特别多，我怕去了二次交叉感染，就去了朋友推荐的汉口医院。
These two hospitals are usually very much, I am afraid to go to a secondary cross-infection, on the recommendation of friends Hankou Hospital.
武汉七院发热门诊外刻不容缓，从武汉三院一出来，我们就直奔汉口医院。
Wuhan seven hospitals outside the fever clinic urgent, from Wuhan three hospitals out, we go straight to Hankou Hospital.
我很着急，觉得不能再等了。
I'm in a hurry. I can't wait any longer.
在汉口医院发热门诊，护士给我爸量体温的时候询问我们有没有去过华南海鲜市场。
At the Hankou Hospital fever clinic, the nurse asked my father if we had been to the South China seafood market when he took his temperature.
我说都没有去过，活禽、野味这些东西也都没有接触过。
I have never been there, nor have any of the live fowl or game been touched.
护士让我爸爸做了一个全面的查血，之后又拍了CT，所有弄完已经是凌晨一点多钟。
The nurse asked my father for a complete blood test, and then took a CT scan, and it was more than one o'clock in the morning.
汉口医院背后有一栋发热大楼，我爸去门口按了门铃后被领进去，但过了大约15分钟又出来了。
There was a hot building behind Hankou Hospital. My father went to the door and rang the doorbell. He was led in, but came out about 15 minutes later.
医生说他还不是很严重，而且医院现在没有床位接收，建议他先回家隔离。
The doctor said that he was not very serious and that the hospital was now without beds. He was advised to go home and be isolated.
医生开了两盒药，5天的剂量，叮嘱说如果中途出现呼吸困难要及时就医。
The doctor prescribed two boxes of medicine for five days and advised to see a doctor if he had difficulty breathing in the middle of the stream.
凌晨三点，我们带着药回了家。
At three in the morning, we went home with the medicine.
一到家就开始隔离，我本来带着两个孩子准备在爸妈家过年，第二天天一亮我就带他们走了。
As soon as I got home, I was going to spend the New Year at my parents' house with my two children.
我回去后就是我妈一个人在家照顾他，她今年63岁，把家里所有的东西消毒了一遍。
When I got back home, my mother, 63, took care of him alone and disinfected everything in the house.
两个人住在不同房间，我爸不舒服或者要喝水就给我妈打个电话，送到门口再让他自己拿进去。
The two of us lived in different rooms, and if my dad was sick or wanted to drink water, he called my mother, sent him to the door and let him in.
我妈戴着口罩，手上有医用手套，她是一个特别小心的人，只要挨过我爸爸的任何东西，就会立刻去洗手，消毒，再消毒！没有预告的感染▲▲▲即使这样，妈妈前两天还是开始干咳，今天去检查的时候，我让她也去拍了个片子，发现肺叶上也出现了同样的阴影点。
My mother wore a mask and had medical gloves on her hand.She was a very careful person who washed her hands, disinfected, and disinfected everything my father had.Even so, my mother started to have a dry cough the other day, and when I went to the examination today, I asked her to do the same and found the same shadow on her lungs.
我还嘱咐她到了七院，到时和爸爸一起去看医生。
I also instructed her to go to the hospital, and then go to the doctor with her father.
我现在只能是在心里祈祷，觉得我爸爸应该属于很严重了，希望七院能把他收进去。
Now I can only pray in my heart that my father should belong to a very serious, hope that the seventh hospital can take him in.
直到现在，我们也不确定到底是怎么染上病毒的。
Until now, we're not sure exactly how it got the virus.
我自己家虽然离华南海鲜市场不算远，但我没去过那里，平时家里门窗紧闭，而且因为孩子要期末考试，前段时间都没和爸妈见过面。
My own home is not too far from the South China seafood market, but I have not been there, usually closed doors and windows, and because the children will have a final examination, parents have not met some time ago.
我爸自己回忆，只有一个可能接触到感染源。
My father himself recalled that there was only one possible source of infection.
因为他做过心脏支架，每个月都要去湖北省人民医院拿药，最近一次拿药是在今年1月12日。
He went to the People's Hospital of Hubei Province every month to get some medicine because he had done a heart scaffold. The last time he took the medicine was on January 12.
那时候大家都还没把肺炎当回事，官方公布的信息也一直是可控可防。
Pneumonia was not taken seriously at the time, and the official information was always controllable and defensible.
我爸去拿药的时候没戴口罩，排队排了一个小时，他推测很有可能就是在那时感染的。
My father waited in line for an hour without a mask when he went to get the medicine. He surmised it was probably at that time.
之前外地人都觉得武汉人不怕死，病毒来了也不在意，其实我天天都在关注肺炎的新闻，但也没有觉得这是一件很严重的事情。
Before the outsiders feel that Wuhan people do not fear death, the virus came do not care, in fact, I have been paying attention to the news of pneumonia, but did not feel that this is a very serious matter.
后来我爸一发热，我就很警惕了。
As soon as my father got hot, I was on my guard.
直到1月20日，官方公布的确诊患者数量一下子增加了100多人，身边其他人才紧张起来。
By Jan. 20, the number of officially confirmed patients jumped by more than 100, leaving others nervous.
我身边有一个四十来岁的朋友在家里咳嗽，一直当感冒治，隔了10天突然发烧，去医院的时候人已经快不行了，现在还上着呼吸机。
I had a friend in my forties who coughed at home, treated for colds all the time, had a fever after 10 days, and went to the hospital almost dead and was now breathing apparatus.
今天我在微博上看到有人在发贴，跟我们的情况一样，也是一天跑了好几家医院都没人收。
Today, I saw someone posting on a microblog. As in our case, it was a day that several hospitals were empty.
我觉得这些人如果回家，人在家里死了，是留不下这个人的记录的，没人知道他是因为肺炎死的，比如说我爸，他有心脏病，做过支架手术，那是不是就可以说他是因为心脏病去世的，而不是肺炎，是不是这个人就白死了？如果真的是这种情况，你把病人都放走了，出去不是会传播给更多的人？记者按目前，武汉已经启动“封城”方案：“自2020年1月23日10时起，全市城市公交、地铁、轮渡、长途客运暂停运营；无特殊原因，市民不要离开武汉，机场、火车站离汉通道暂时关闭。
No one knows that he died of pneumonia. For example, my father, who had a heart attack and had stent surgery, can say that he died of heart disease, not pneumonia.
”在前一日晚间的新闻发布会上，武汉市人民政府副市长陈邂馨表示，计划安排7家医院腾出3400张床位，专门收治发热患者。
At a news conference the previous evening, Chen Xinxin, deputy mayor of Wuhan city's people's government, said the plan was to free 3,400 beds in seven hospitals to treat febrile patients.
截止发稿时，李雪的父亲已经进入武汉市第七人民医院，但仍未能收治入院，鉴于病情严重在急症室待了一夜，正在排队打针。
At the time of writing, Li's father had been admitted to Wuhan Seventh People's Hospital, but had still not been admitted to hospital and was queuing up for an injection, given the severity of his illness.
