欧洲杯确认延期至2021年，这对刚刚经历过疫情休市的彩票市场来说，无疑是雪上加霜。
The postponement of the European Cup to 2021 is a further setback for the lottery market, which has just experienced a lull in the epidemic.
随着新冠肺炎疫情在海外蔓延，作为竞彩重要内容的五大联赛（西甲、意甲、英超、德甲、法甲）全部停摆，美国职业篮球联赛（以下简称“NBA”）也宣布本赛季暂时停赛，这意味着，在经历了近50天的休市后，体彩开售等来的是竞彩无赛可猜的悲惨局面。
With the outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia spreading overseas, the five major leagues (Spanish, Serie A, Premiership, Bundesliga and French), which are important contenders, have also suspended their professional basketball leagues (NBA) this season, meaning that after a 50-day hiatus, the sport has seen no guesses.
据业内人士预测，受欧洲杯延期和此前疫情停售影响，预计这两个月竞彩销量将减少近100亿元至200亿元。
Sales are expected to drop by nearly 10 billion yuan to 20 billion yuan in the two months ahead of the European Cup extension and the suspension of previous outbreaks, industry insiders predict.
整体来看，今年全年体彩销量或将减少800亿元左右，同时，不少本就挣扎在“生死边缘”的彩票店将难以为继，这对体彩现有渠道造成的影响值得业界关注。
Overall, sports-lottery sales are likely to shrink by about 80 billion yuan this year, and many lottery stores that are already struggling to survive on the edge of life and death are having an impact on existing gaming channels.
无赛可猜“3月12日恢复营业，前三天还能卖个十来万块钱，现在相关赛事都停了，一天也就能卖几千块钱，我让员工都休息了，就剩我一个人看店。
"I was back in business on March 12 and was able to sell a hundred thousand bucks for the first three days. Now that the competition was over and I could sell a few thousand dollars a day, I gave the employees a rest and left me to look after the store alone.
”中部省份一家彩票店主张强（化名）在接受《中国经营报》记者采访时表示。
A lottery shop in the central province of Qiang (not his real name) told China Business News in an interview.
张强在当地经营着两家彩票店，平时竞彩一个月的销量有200万元左右，约占店铺销量的80%。
Zhang, who runs two lottery stores in the region, is bidding for about two million yuan a month, about 80 percent of the store's sales.
所谓竞彩，是单场竞猜游戏的通俗叫法，是一种固定赔率的竞猜型游戏彩票，以体育比赛为竞猜媒介。
The so-called bidding is the popular name for a single game of guessing, is a fixed odds-based game lottery, with sports as the medium of guessing.
每年的五大联赛、NBA是竞彩的主要销量。
The big five league games and the NBA are the main ones.
而竞彩是我国彩票市场销售量最高的游戏之一。
Bidding is one of the top-selling games in lottery market in China.
“有类似世界杯、欧洲杯这种大型比赛的时候，店里的销量基本能翻一番。
"There are big games like the World Cup and the European Cup where sales almost double.
”张强说。
"said Zhang Qiang.
受疫情影响，彩票休市，各彩票实体店店主近两个月没有收入。
Affected by the epidemic, lotteries closed, lottery entities shop owners for nearly two months without income.
终于盼来开售，等来的却是各大赛事停赛的消息。
Finally look forward to the opening of the sale, but it is the suspension of major events news.
随着疫情在海外的进一步蔓延，意甲、西甲、英超等联赛纷纷停摆。
With the further spread of the epidemic abroad, Serie A, Spain, the Premier League and other league games have been suspended.
3月17日晚，欧足联正式宣布，为避免疫情影响，欧洲杯推迟至2021年夏天。
On the night of March 17, UEFA officially announced that the European Cup would be postponed until the summer of 2021 to avoid the effects of the outbreak.
“好不容易盼到开售，欧洲各大比赛却停赛了，现在基本无赛可猜的局面，这对我们（的销量）影响非常大。
"It's hard to look forward to the start of sales, but the big games in Europe have been suspended and there is almost no guesswork, which has a big impact on us.
”山东一位彩票店主告诉本报记者。
A lottery owner in Shandong told the reporter.
张强坦言，“往年这个时候正是竞彩的销售高峰，五大联赛进行了差不多四分之三，越往后比赛关注度越高。
Zhang admitted: "This time of year is the peak of the auction sales, the five league games almost three-quarters, the more attention the higher the competition.
”数据显示，历届欧洲杯都会带来竞彩，包括体彩销量大幅度增长的机遇。
Figures show that successive European championships offer opportunities for substantial increases, including in body colour sales.
2016年欧洲杯竞彩销量105亿元，直追2014年世界杯129亿元的销量。
Europe Cup 2016 sales volume of 10.5 billion yuan, directly following the 2014 World Cup sales of 12.9 billion yuan.
受此影响，2016年全年体彩销量1881.5亿元，同比增长13.1%。
As a result, sports lottery sales reached $18.15 billion in 2016, up 13.1% from the previous year.
“停赛影响下，大部分体彩实体店都是赔钱的，传统彩票能卖得好的是极其个别的。
"Most of the sports shops are losing money because of the suspension, and the traditional lotteries are very individual.
”一位体彩实体店业主告诉本报记者，“由于去年政策的收紧，加上今年疫情的影响，对实体店销售的冲击非常巨大。
"Tightening policy last year and the impact of this year's epidemic have had a huge impact on physical-store sales," the owner of a body-color entity told the newspaper.
”上述彩票店主告诉本报记者，“算上房租、人工、水电费等成本，我的店每天要卖7000元以上才能覆盖成本，但最近能猜的赛事寥寥无几，其他彩种的销量一直都是小头，每天能卖3000元都很难。
"Counting the cost of rent, labour and utilities, my shop is selling more than 7,000 yuan a day to cover its costs, but there have been few guesses lately, and sales of other colours have been small, making it difficult to sell 3,000 yuan a day," the lottery owner told the newspaper.
”据了解，这还是当地销量比较好的彩票店情况，剩下的彩票店销量更是不尽如人意。
It is understood that this is the best-selling lottery shop in the region, with the remaining lottery stores selling worse than expected.
前景暗淡竞彩销量不仅是体彩销量的主力，也是体彩店主收入的主要来源。
The dim prospect of bidding sales is not only the main body color sales, but also the main source of body color shop owners income.
“前期没算各足球赛事取消的影响，光停售一个多月，平均每家彩票店每月减少收入1万元左右。
"The previous period did not count the impact of the cancellation of football matches, just stop selling for more than a month, each lottery shop reduced income by about 10,000 yuan per month.
”一位彩票行业资深专家告诉本报记者，“这几年彩票实体店本就经营困难，将近一半的彩票店都在生死间挣扎，这次疫情影响下，很可能加速彩票专营店的退出。
"In recent years, sports lottery stores have been running so hard that nearly half of all lottery stores are struggling to survive," a senior lottery expert told the paper.
”“我们这儿彩票店的经营情况基本是二八分，80%的彩票店盈利都不太好，两极分化严重。
"We have lottery stores here that are almost twenty-eight, and 80 percent of them are not very profitable and very polarized.
”前述彩票店主说，“疫情影响下，之前的停售加上近期比赛停赛，大部分彩票店都在赔钱。
"Most lottery stores are losing money because of the epidemic," said the lottery owner.
”2019年，主管部门针对高频快开游戏进行调整后（详见《中国经营报》2019年2月23日报道《高频快开游戏销量下降近一半机构预测：2019年彩票销量或降到4000亿元以下》），竞彩和高频快开游戏销量下降明显，已经让不少彩票专营店举步维艰。
In 2019, authorities adjusted for high-frequency fast-start games (see China Business Daily February 23, 2019, which reports that nearly half of the sales of high-frequency fast-start games will fall to less than 400 billion yuan in 2019), bidding and high-frequency fast-start games are down sharply.
“去年就有不少退机的同行了，还有一帮人在坚持，但高频和竞彩占销量的90%以上，加上疫情影响，收入非常不稳定，我们也不看好行业的未来。
"Last year there were quite a few quitters and a bunch of people were sticking with them, but high frequency and gaming accounted for more than 90 percent of sales, and with the epidemic, incomes are very volatile and we are not optimistic about the future of the industry.
”广东一家彩票店主告诉本报记者。
A lottery owner in Guangdong told the reporter.
尽管目前相关部门也在陆续对彩票店主进行补贴，包括每月给予一定金额的补贴或者提高佣金等方式，但收效甚微。
Lottery owners are also being subsidised, including a monthly stipend or a higher commission rate, with little success.
“补贴就是补很少的部分，是不够的。
"Subsidies are a small complement, not enough.
加佣金的话，已经没有销量了，加佣金有什么用呢？”多位彩票店主表示。
If you add a commission, there are no sales. What's the use of a commission? "said many lottery owners.
政策上的调整，叠加疫情的影响，不少实体店店主对行业前景较为悲观。
Policy adjustments, the impact of the superimposition of the epidemic, many entity shop owners are more pessimistic about the industry outlook.
“这次疫情可能让很多专营店坚定了退出的决心，如果销量大减导致体彩店主撤店退机，对体彩现有渠道的影响更大。
"The epidemic is likely to strengthen the resolve of many specialty stores to quit, and if the sales slump leads to the withdrawal of body color shop owners, the existing body color channel will have a greater impact.
”一位彩票业内人士在接受《中国经营报》记者采访时表示。
"A lottery insider told China Business News.
财政部数据显示，2020年1月，竞猜型彩票销售68.04亿元，同比减少96.10亿元，下降58.5%。
According to the Ministry of Finance, in January 2020, sales of lottery tickets totaled 6.804 billion yuan, a decrease of 9.610 billion yuan, or 58.5 percent.
体育彩票机构销售143.20亿元，同比减少124.16亿元，下降46.4%。
Sports lottery sales of 14.320 billion yuan, a decrease of 12.416 billion yuan, or 46.4 percent.
据业内人士预测，“按照往届世界杯和欧洲杯的比例，2018年世界杯销量比2014年涨了差不多4倍，正常情况下，今年欧洲杯也会比上届欧洲杯销量增长4倍左右，算上互联网停售的影响，300亿元左右的销量是非常可能的。
According to industry insiders, "World Cup sales in 2018 are nearly four times higher than in 2014, and normally they will be about four times higher than last year's Europa League.
”“这也就意味着欧洲杯的推迟，竞彩销量可能减少300亿元左右。
"It would also mean a delay in the European Cup, with sales likely to drop by about 30 billion yuan.
整体来看，今年疫情或将导致体彩销量减少约800亿元，将降到2000亿以下。
Overall, the epidemic is likely to reduce body color sales by about 80 billion yuan this year, to less than 200 billion.
”上述业内人士说。
'said the insiders.
谈及是否有应对措施渡过难关，前述山东的彩票店主表示，“我一直在多种经营，不仅仅销售竞彩，大乐透、即开等等都做，目前还能维持下来。
"I have diversified a lot, not only selling lottery tickets, but also selling lottery tickets, opening and so on," said the Shandong lottery owner.
这个阶段也在搞培训学习，等待行业反弹。
This phase is also engaged in training and learning, waiting for the industry to rebound.
”“以后实体渠道更多会是社会渠道兼营，就是商超、便利店等其他行业兼营卖彩票。
"" In the future, the physical channels will be more social channels, that is, super-business, convenience stores and other industries also sell lottery tickets.
”前述彩票业内人士说。
"said the lottery industry insider.
也有观点认为，增设其他赛事的竞猜可能是更可行的办法。
The view was also expressed that guessing at additional events might be a more viable option.
3月14日，国家体育总局体育彩票管理中心发布《再致体育彩票购彩者的一封信》中指出，“我们正密切关注着各国疫情发展态势，跟踪分析相关足球、篮球联赛信息，竭力选择广受欢迎、公信力高的国际赛事作为竞猜对象，以满足广大购彩者购彩娱乐、助力公益的需求。
On March 14, the Sports Lottery Management Center of the State General Administration of Sports issued a letter to lottery buyers stating that "We are closely monitoring the development of the situation in various countries, tracking and analyzing relevant football and basketball league information, and making every effort to select the most popular and credible international competitions to meet the needs of the general public.
