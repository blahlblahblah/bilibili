文｜陈恕行📍发自美国湾区1南海岸的二月已经有了初夏的感觉，从暖风中穿过，阳光里能清晰地看到一粒粒金黄的花粉从树上纷纷落下。
Feeling like early summer, the sun can clearly see a grain of golden pollen falling from the trees as it travels along the southern coast of the Gulf of America.
每天下午两点，我录入完微博上最新的求助帖，走出图书馆回家。
Every afternoon at 2 p. m., I typed in the latest post on Weibo and walked home from the library.
等着国内的志愿者伙伴们醒来前的这两个多小时，是我每天的喘息时间。
Waiting for my domestic volunteer partners to wake up for more than two hours is my daily respite.
然而我毕竟可以逃离，只要盖上屏幕，眼前又风和日丽。
However, I can escape, as long as the screen covered, the wind is beautiful.
国内早上七八点，前一晚熬夜的伙伴们已经陆续醒来。
Seven or eight o'clock in the morning, the night before the partners have been waking up.
群里的信息也飞快轮转起来：“昨天录入的xx老人，得到反馈已经去世了。
The information in the group also whirled quickly: "yesterday's input xx old man, get feedback has passed away.
”“xxx已经入院了。
"" xxx was admitted to the hospital.
”“我去核实...刚打电话，昨天还在发布消息，刚刚去世了...”“昨天录入的xx老人去世了。
"" I went to verify... just now on the phone, and it was announced yesterday that I had just passed away... "" The xx old man recorded yesterday died.
”“一个患者刚上了去医院的车就没了。
"" A patient just got on the bus to the hospital and it was gone.
”“这个病人的情况我们有办法解决吗?”“现在还缺一个人打这半页的电话，谁来？”“@xx 这家的情况可以标注危重吗？”“有一位患者反馈xx，供我们参考。
"" Is there any way we can solve the patient's condition? "" Who is missing the half-page call? "" Can the @ xx family be marked critical? "" There was a patient feedback xx for our information.
”在信息的不断轰炸下，每个人都在专注地做自己负责的那部分工作，有人转求助信息，有人录入，有人电话核实，有人填各种表格上报，还有一些无法归类的求助会想办法找到可以对接的组织。
Under the constant bombardment of information, everyone is concentrating on the part of the job for which they are responsible, with referrals, entries, telephone verifications, various forms to report, and some unclassifiable ways to find organizations that can be docked.
有时候快速地看过几百条信息、压着时间提交表格，与伙伴们讨论问题到深夜，准备关上电脑睡觉时，我才意识到自己刚才一直屏着呼吸。
Sometimes after a quick read of hundreds of messages, pressing time to submit forms, discussing problems late at night, getting ready to shut my computer to sleep, I realized I had been holding my breath.
没有意外的话，又是一个久久无法睡去、或早早醒来的夜晚。
No surprises, another long sleepless night, or an early awakening.
2从一月初疫情开始蔓延时，我再也没有睡好过，虽然我身处一万公里之外的美国。
2 Since the outbreak began in early January, I have never slept better, although I am in the United States 10,000 kilometres away.
丈夫在武汉读过书，那里有我们共同的美好记忆，从未想过脑海里有春樱和热干面的武汉会与“肺炎”、“疫情”这两个词联系起来。
My husband read a book in Wuhan, where we have shared good memories and never thought that Wuhan, with its spring blossoms and hot, dry noodles, would be associated with "pneumonia" and "epidemic."
最初的一周，我不停看国内外报道和微博，与网友们一起为医护人员、患者、无处收留武汉人揪心，追讨红十字会的腐败。
The first week, I kept looking at domestic and foreign reports and Weibo, and netizens together for the medical staff, patients, no place to shelter Wuhan people worried about, the Red Cross corruption.
在给校友会捐款后，我还是什么也干不下去。
After donating money to the alumni association, I still can't do anything.
我意识自己内心的焦灼来源于无能为力，只有做点什么才能减轻这种负罪感。
I realized that my inner anxiety stemmed from my inability to do anything to alleviate my guilt.
二月伊始，在朋友的介绍下，我终于加入了志愿者小组，又陆续加入了七个相关的小组。
At the beginning of February, at the introduction of my friends, I finally joined the volunteer group and then joined seven related groups.
我惊讶于民间志愿者们的行动力和对患者需求的细致挖掘。
I was amazed at the action of the volunteers and the meticulous excavation of the needs of the patients.
疫情一开始爆发，志愿者们通过网络集结，迅速按照自己的专业和需求分成了许多小分队：科普疫情知识和预防方法；采集和汇总求助信息，由有医学、社工、心理学的志愿者为尚未住院的患者及家属提供医学答疑和帮助，给一部分患者提供制氧机，联系社区，帮助患者尽快可以入院；收集和更新武汉及周边县市的床位信息、可以做核酸测试的医院和测试流程；给武汉留守孕妇们提供医院信息和帮助；征集当地志愿者，提供、交换供需信息，运送医疗物资，接送医护人员和患者；制作疫情相关的海报，等等。
Volunteers quickly divided themselves into teams according to their specialties and needs: knowledge of the epidemic and prevention methods; collecting and aggregating help for patients and their families; providing oxygen machines for some patients, contacting the community and helping patients to be admitted as soon as possible; collecting and updating hospital information and help; collecting and updating local volunteers, providing and exchanging supply and demand information, transporting medical materials, transporting medical personnel and patients, etc.
因为和国内存在尴尬的时差，我做的事情非常繁杂，看到组里有什么可以做的就去做。
Because of the awkward time difference with home, I do a lot of things and do what I see in the group.
有时候我会打医院询问收治流程、联系求助者核实信息；大部分时间我在几个组之间穿梭，在微博、豆瓣和朋友圈收集求助信息、填写表格，私信求助人核实信息，帮助求助者寻找入院途径。
Sometimes I call the hospital to check on the admissions process, contact the caller to verify the information; most of the time I travel between groups, collecting help messages, filling out forms in micro-blogging, peas and circles of friends, checking information with private help-seekers and helping them find a way to go to hospital.
糟糕的睡眠不再困扰我。
Bad sleep no longer bothers me.
要做的事情太多，凌晨若醒了，起来和伙伴们一起干活便是。
There is so much to do. If you wake up in the early morning, get up and work with your friends.
志愿者群里，时不时会看到组员反馈求助者的新消息。
From time to time, volunteers receive feedback from the group about new messages from their clients.
我们会为了求助者的好转或入院而一起欢呼，但也常接到患者去世的信息。
We cheer together for the betterment or admission of our patients, but often receive word of their death.
每次看到录入过的患者离世，热闹忙碌的群里都会出现短暂的沉默，随后，我们彼此安慰、打气，继续向前。
Every time I see a patient enter the world, there is a brief silence in the busy crowd. Then we comfort each other, cheer up, and move on.
某天，我们投入很多精力的一位求助者离世，大家接到消息都非常难过。
One day, we put a lot of energy into the death of a benefactor, we are very sad to receive the news.
一位小伙伴说道：“我们做的工作很有意义，我们在努力让更多人不成为数字。
"What we're doing makes sense and we're trying to keep more people from becoming numbers," said one small partner.
”这是每天支持我继续下去的理由。
That's the reason I keep it going every day.
3走过阳光照拂的林荫道，坐在宽敞的图书馆里收集求助信息，我常感深陷一场精神分裂的梦里。
Walking through the sun-kissed mall and sitting in a spacious library collecting help messages, I often feel trapped in a schizophrenic dream.
这边春深似海，那边愁云惨淡。
This spring is like the sea, over there melancholy.
尽管白天志愿者们已经采集过很多求助帖，但凌晨时，我仍然能看到十几条新帖子。
Even though the volunteers had collected a lot of help posts during the day, I was able to see a dozen new posts in the early hours of the morning.
那些呼救令人心碎，又如此卑微：“我的外公已经去世了，外婆病危，请救救我们吧，”“我的丈夫才三十五岁，救救这个家吧！”“我们家已经有三个人感染了，我们只求能先把爸爸送进医院。
The cries for help were heartbreaking and humble: "My grandfather is dead, my grandmother is dying, please help us." "My husband is only thirty-five years old, help this family!"
”“不好意思占用公共资源，我真的试了所有的办法...” 我知道了武汉话里管外婆叫“家家”，很遗憾的是，我认识这个词语的方式也是通过求助帖：“外公已经去世了，家家病重，我不想再失去家家了！”很多人在一个月的时间里失去数位亲人，但求助时，他们反而会抱歉给网友添了麻烦。
"" I'm sorry for taking up public resources, but I really tried everything... "I learned that in Wuhan I used to call my grandmother" family. "Unfortunately, the way I knew the word was through a help post:" My grandfather is dead, my family is badly ill, I don't want to lose my family again!
有一天国内凌晨四点，我给三位求助的博主发私信询问地址电话，马上就收到了回复。
One day at 4 a.m. in China, I sent a private letter to three bloggers asking for an address, and I received a reply immediately.
想来他们还没睡，在长夜里枯守希望。
Presumably they are still awake, watching for hope in the long night.
其中一位是医护人员，家人得不到床位，她已经做了雾化、服药、吸氧等操作，但年迈的亲人情况还是每况愈下。
One of them, a paramedic, had no bed for her family. She had been atomized, drugged and oxygen-sucked, but her elderly relatives were still in a worse condition.
在私信交换信息后，她表达感谢，温柔地叮嘱我也快去休息。
After exchanging personal messages, she thanked me and gently told me to get some rest.
短短的交流里，她带给我的温暖远超过我能给她的帮助。
In the short communication, she brought me more warmth than I could give her help.
几天后，我悄悄回访了她的主页，看到她的家人已经入院，而她自己还在与病毒抗争。
A few days later, I quietly visited her home page and saw that her family had been hospitalized while she was still battling the virus.
另一天，有网友发帖求助，长辈去世数天，遗体还没运走。
Another day, some netizens post for help, the elder died a few days, the body has not been removed.
我发送了当地所有定点殡仪馆的信息，并告诉她，我已经收录了她亲属的病情记录。
I sent information about all the local funeral homes and told her that I had taken the medical records of her relatives.
她感谢我：“太麻烦大家了。
She thanked me, "It's too much trouble.
”我想告诉她没有人该为活着抱歉、为获得基本的权利而羞愧，可最终也只是笨拙地回复：“没有人该经历这些。
I wanted to tell her that no one should be ashamed to live, ashamed to gain basic rights, but only to reply clumsily in the end: "No one should go through this.
”在他们的痛苦面前，任何语言都显得无力、苍白。
"No language seemed weak or pale in the face of their pain.
4这半个月里，最让我心碎的总是老人们。
It's always the old people who break my heart most in this half month.
从微博收录求助信息时，不少帖子下有网友要“坦白地说实话”，劝告博主，老年人年纪大了，多半救不回来，是浪费医疗资源，还有说“不如安乐死”的。
Some people believe that euthanasia is better than euthanasia. Some people believe that euthanasia is better than euthanasia, and some people believe that euthanasia is better than euthanasia.
有年纪较大的求助者不太会用微博发图片，没贴出就诊单据，就被网友围攻“造谣”、“没图就举报”。
Older applicants are less likely to use microblogging to send pictures, not paste out medical bills, netizens besieged "disinformation", "no plan to report."
还有博主提出“牺牲这一代老人”来 “保全千秋万代”。
Still have blogger put forward "sacrifice this generation of old people" to "save thousands of generations".
我的愤怒已经变成一种深涌的痛苦，毕竟现实中，老人们一直是最先被牺牲掉的那批人。
My anger has turned into a kind of deep pain, after all, the elderly have always been the first to be sacrificed.
几天前深夜，群里有人发出求助，三十多位原本应该送到方舱的老人，因为年龄太大被拒收，拉到火车站附近放下，在寒风里挨冻。
A few nights earlier, some one in the group had sent for help. More than thirty old men, who were supposed to have been sent to the cabin, had been turned away because they were too old to put down in the cold wind near the station.
不同群里的志愿者马上开始寻找可以接送的车辆，打电话联系，一次次在群里汇报老人们的状态，终于在凌晨一点半将所有老人送回家。
Volunteers from different groups immediately began to look for cars to pick up, made phone calls, reported on the condition of the elderly in the group, and finally sent them home at 1: 30 in the morning.
这些老人的遭遇并非孤例。
These old people are not alone.
在硬指标要求所有确诊病人都收治时，有无法自理的老人在隔离点得不到照顾和药物，病情加重；有老人从隔离点又被送回家，让家属自己联系床位。
When the mandatory target is that all confirmed patients are admitted, elderly persons who are unable to care for themselves are left without care and medication in isolation points, which exacerbates their condition; older persons are sent home from isolation points and their families are allowed to contact their own beds.
志愿者们觉得沮丧，好不容易入院或送入隔离点的患者，很快接到几位家属哭诉，病人在隔离点没有人照顾、没有药物，病情加重。
Frustrated, the patients, who had to be hospitalized or placed in isolation, soon received cries from several family members that the patients were left without care or medication at the quarantine site and that their condition had worsened.
然而患者只要被送到隔离点就不算“未收治”，志愿者也无能为力。
However, as long as the patient is sent to the isolation point is not "untreated," volunteers can do nothing.
我不敢深想，疑心自己也参与制造了他们的境遇，担心我所谓的“帮助”不过是将求助者推入另一个深渊。
I did not dare to think deeply, suspecting that I had also been involved in creating their situation, fearing that what I called "help" was simply pushing the supplicant into another abyss.
在开通了新的收治渠道，可以更快输送一部分危重病人时，我很激动。
I was excited when new treatment channels were opened to deliver a portion of the critically ill more quickly.
那时我刚刚加了一位求助者的微信，她的名字与我朋友的名字相同，让我倍感亲切。
I had just added a message from a suitor whose name was the same as that of my friend and which made me feel very close.
一问年纪，原来阿姨五十多了，在为自己七八十岁的父母求救，填了所有能填的表格，但父母还未收治，病情已经很难再等了。
A question age, the original aunt more than 50 years old, for their parents 78 years old, fill out all the forms can be filled out, but parents have not yet been admitted, the disease is difficult to wait for.
我马上又向阿姨要病情记录，坚定地告诉她我会上报。
I immediately asked my aunt for the medical records, firmly told her I would report.
没想到表格填完，申报的规则便更新：主要接收六十岁以下的患者，高龄老人还是要和其他未收录的病人一样等待，一切回到原点。
When the form was completed, the rules were updated: patients under the age of 60 would be accepted, the elderly would still have to wait like other patients who were not included, and everything would return to where they came from.
然而名单里大部分病情危重的求助者，都是高龄老人。
But most of the critically ill patients on the list are elderly people.
等待在某种程度上，意味着等死。
Waiting means, in a way, waiting to die.
我感到愧疚，觉得辜负了阿姨的托付，又怕告诉她后让她更加绝望。
I feel guilty, feel disappointed by the aunt's trust, and afraid to tell her to let her more desperate.
之后的每天我都偷偷去看她的状态，很怕看到噩耗。
Every day since then I have secretly to see her state, very afraid to see bad news.
好在前天，阿姨的母亲终于入院，我才稍放下心来。
Fortunately, the day before yesterday, aunt's mother finally admitted to hospital, I just a little relieved.
有亲属子女帮忙张罗的老人还算幸运的。
Those old people who have relatives and children to help Zhang Luo are lucky.
很多独居老人，无人照料，一旦生病，连呼救的机会可能都没有，等到生病的信息被外界获知时，已经垂危。
Many elderly people who live alone and are left unattended may not even have the opportunity to call for help in the event of illness, and are dying when news of their illness comes to light.
在感染人数如此庞大的当下，我明白高龄老人多数有基础疾病，感染后病情凶险，青壮年更容易经过治疗存活，也清楚如今医疗资源的紧缺。
With such a large number of people infected, I understand that the elderly most of the basic diseases, after infection dangerous, young adults are more likely to survive treatment, but also aware of today's shortage of medical resources.
然而当微博在大肆赞扬退休老人、贫困老人捐出一生积蓄的时候，老人们又是最后被考虑的人群。
But while Weibo is lavishing praise on retired, poor older people who donate their life savings, the elderly are the last to be considered.
如果我们不能顾及社会中最弱者的需求，至少不要合理化这种忽视。
If we fail to take into account the needs of the weakest members of society, at least that neglect should not be rationalized.
有老人在久久得不到救治的绝望中跳楼——他的死让那封求助信息在几个志愿者小组里疯转，大家都想要帮助他的老伴获得救治。
There was an old man jumping out of the building in a long, untreated despair - his death sent the message crashing through volunteer groups trying to help his old man get treatment.
奶奶六十八岁，在他死后很快得到了收治。
Grandma was sixty-eight and was admitted to hospital soon after his death.
让老年人付出如此惨烈的代价给家人换一个床位的社会，每个人都该感到羞耻。
Everyone should be ashamed in a society where the elderly pay such a dearly high price for a new bed for their families.
之所以有网友能理直气壮地说出“放弃老人”，不过因为我们的社会就是按这套逻辑运行的。
Some netizens can reasonably say "give up the old", but because our society is running according to this set of logic.
这套社会达尔文逻辑把每个人榨干，切断人与人之间的共情和互助，再毫不留情地抛弃没用的工具，甚至让他们自己都觉得求助可耻。
This social Darwinian logic drains everyone, cuts off empathy and mutual help, leaves useless tools unmercifully behind, and makes them feel ashamed to ask for help.
可年轻人也终究会变成老人，那时我们又该如何走入自己的黑夜呢？也许我们可以放弃老人换来千秋万代，但那样的繁衍，冷过死亡，不过是行尸的更新迭代。
But young people will eventually become old, then how should we go into our own dark night? Perhaps we can give up the old people in exchange for thousands of generations, but that reproduction, cold death, is just a new iteration of the corpse.
56日晚，在李医生去世后，网络上掀起了悲伤的巨浪。
On the night of May 56, following the death of Dr. Lee, a wave of sadness surged across the Internet.
清晨看到信息，我积压已久的悲伤也爆发出来，哭泣许久。
Early in the morning to see the message, my long backlog of grief also burst out, crying for a long time.
然而天还没亮，就有声音呼吁大家不要“煽风点火”、“借题发挥”，要“理性看待”，为李医生到底是不是“吹哨人”而争论，这很悲哀。
But before it was light, there was a voice calling on everyone not to "fan the flames" or "use the topic," to "treat rationally," and to argue over whether Dr. Li was a "whistler."
问题的关键，难道不是反省为什么李医生会被训诫、如何避免下一个李医生的出现，以及如何更及时地控制疫情吗？为什么我们要这么恐惧和忌讳人们自然的情感表达和讨论呢？对病毒的研究在不断深入，如何防御、如何响应、怎么更好地调配物资、如何更好地保护国民，都是实际操作层面的问题，而技术问题应该允许反馈和讨论，否则要如何改进呢？一个政策颁布下来，会影响很多人的生活、甚至关乎生死，为什么受影响的人不可以说说自己遇到的困难呢？在看了几百条求助帖和家属的反馈后，也许我可以说说现存的一些问题。
Is it not a question of reflecting on why Dr Lee will be admonished, how to avoid the appearance of the next Dr Lee, and how to control the epidemic in a more timely fashion? Why should we allow feedback and discussion about the virus, or how to improve it?
封城之后，交通给患者就诊带来了巨大挑战。
After the closure of the city, transportation to patients brought great challenges.
很多家庭没有车，一些老年人的子女可能因为封城无法回来。
Many families do not have cars, and the children of some older persons may not be able to return because of closures.
有几位家属反映，找不到车接送，年迈的父母只能拖着病体在寒风中在医院和家之间往返。
Several family members reported that they were unable to find a car and that elderly parents had to shuffle between the hospital and their homes in the cold wind.
还有老人被120带到医院做测试，做完检查没有车回家，只能在医院大厅坐到天亮。
The elderly were also taken to the hospital for tests. No cars came home after the check-up. They had to sit in the hospital lobby until morning.
有生完孩子没有车回家的产妇。
A woman who has given birth and has no car to go home.
家属如果想要给住院的亲人送些急用的物品，也要四处托人。
If the family wanted to send urgent items to their relatives in hospital, they had to send them around.
即使有社区派车，但因为车上缺乏急救设备，一位好不容易得到收治机会的患者，在去往医院的车上死去。
Even if the community sent a car, but because of the lack of emergency equipment, a hard-won patient died on the bus to the hospital.
更普遍的情况还是漫长的等待。
More generally, there is still a long wait.
即使CT显示肺部的感染严重，但大多时候核酸阳性依旧是获得入院机会的必要依据。
Even if CT shows a severe lung infection, nucleic acid-positive remains the necessary basis for admission most of the time.
没有确诊的患者难以得到床位，只能继续排队做核酸，等待下一次未知的测试结果。
Undiagnosed patients find it difficult to get a bed and have to wait in line for the next unknown test results.
一位家属在患者交流群说道：“我妈终于住上医院了，可我知道她回不来了。
"My mother finally went to the hospital, but I knew she couldn't get back," a family member told a patient exchange group.
” 另一位家属悲愤地说自己的家人至今没有住院，难道就这么等死吗？她拍下医院走廊里刚刚去世的陌生老人，老人的亲属在尸体边戴着口罩流泪。
Another family member, indignant that her family had not yet been hospitalized, was waiting to die? She photographed a strange old man in the hospital hallway, his relatives weeping over the body wearing a mask.
肺炎发展到最后，患者常会呼吸衰竭，用力吸气也满足不了身体的需求，痛苦不堪。
Pneumonia develops finally, patient often respiratory failure, with force inhale also cannot satisfy the body demand, painful state.
很多人去世时都张大嘴巴，正如那张照片中老人的模样，而他们的家人只能眼睁睁看着他们死去。
Many people die with their mouths open, as in the picture of the old man, and their families can only watch them die.
众多患者苦苦求生时，也有人求一死。
Many sufferers struggle to survive, while others seek to die.
有位癌症晚期患者原本住的医院被征收，只能立刻回家。
A hospital where a terminally ill cancer patient used to live was expropriated and had to return home immediately.
患者时日无多，每天都非常煎熬，家属寻求临终护理，只希望家人能够少一些痛苦离世。
The days are short and the patients are suffering daily. Families seek hospice care in the hope that their families will die less.
我突然意识到在这场战役中，想要安详地死去也成为了一种奢侈。
It suddenly dawned on me that in this battle it was a luxury to want to die peacefully.
在收治时，也出现了程序复杂、机构互相踢皮球和其他患者被忽视的情况。
Complex procedures, inter-agency kickbacks and neglect of other patients also occur in admissions.
有患者在住院后失联，家属只能在群里焦灼地寻找同医院的患者，打听家人的现状。
Some patients lost contact after hospitalization, the family can only in the group anxious to find patients with the hospital, ask about the status of their families.
有些社区、医院互相推责，社区要家属自己联系医院找床位，医院说必须有社区开的转诊单，社区又回复没听说过要开转诊单，家属只能到处打电话、往返奔波。
Some communities, hospitals blame each other, communities ask families to contact the hospital for beds themselves, hospitals say there must be a referral form from the community, and the community has responded that it has not heard of a referral form and that families have to make calls and travel from one place to another.
有拿着外地户口的护工得病后无处收留，只能露宿街头。
With a foreign account care workers have no place to stay after the illness, can only live on the street.
有需要插管、透析、放疗的患者因为医院被征用、医生调走而无法继续得到治疗，生命垂危。
Patients in need of intubation, dialysis and radiotherapy are dying because hospitals have been requisitioned and doctors have been removed from them and are unable to continue receiving treatment.
我们已经看到好几例因为没有及时做透析而离世的求助者。
We have seen several cases of patients who died because they did not undergo dialysis in time.
我知道，对于一部分生命没有受到威胁的人们，当然不难说出现在情况严峻，医疗资源短缺，“有些牺牲不可避免”，“我们要为大局考虑”，“要考虑效益的最大化”。
I know that for some people whose lives are not threatened, it is not difficult to say that the situation is dire, that medical resources are scarce, that "some sacrifices are inevitable," that "we want to think about the big picture," and that "we have to think about maximizing the benefits."
可人不是一颗棋子或螺丝，每一条生命都有活下去的资格。
Cocoa is not a piece or screw, every life has the right to live.
看到这么多患者的遭遇后，我害怕我深爱的亲友和自己某天也会成为大局中必须牺牲掉的那部分人；更害怕的是，没有人为我们发声。
After seeing so many patients, I am afraid that my loved ones and myself will one day be the ones who have to be sacrificed in the bigger picture.
这场灾难里，是医护人员的付出、普通人的彼此守望让我们的社会不至于信念崩塌、陷入黑暗。
In this disaster, is the pay of medical personnel, ordinary people watch over each other so that our society does not collapse in faith, plunged into darkness.
然而，这些荡气回肠、温暖感人的时刻，不该抵消我们对问题的深思。
However, these emotional, warm moments should not cancel out our reflection on the problem.
在那些悲泣呼告的落难者面前，任何的粉饰、赞颂、鸡汤都无异于二次伤害。
In the face of those who cry out before the victims, any whitewash, praise, chicken soup is tantamount to secondary injury.
他们需要的是反省、追责、公道、改进。
What they need is introspection, accountability, justice and improvement.
6一位同是志愿者的朋友对我说，虽然帮助了很多患者入院，但她还是感到羞耻。
A friend who was also a volunteer told me that although she helped many patients to go to hospital, she was still ashamed.
我也是。
Me too.
那么多求助的人，那么多急需救治的人，可能几小时就是生死之别，但床位只有那么多，总有一部分人得不到及时的救助。
So many people, so many in need of help, may be a matter of life or death for hours, but there are only so many beds, and there are always some people who do not receive timely help.
有志愿者打电话核实，家属哭泣着说，家里两个八十多岁的老人已经垂危，现在就是在等死。
Volunteers called to verify that the family weeping, the family of two people in their eighties is dying, is now waiting to die.
放下电话后，小伙伴问我，这种情况可以加快处理吗？我感到心被捏碎了。
When I put down the phone, my partner asked me if I could speed up the process. I felt my heart crushed.
然而我知道即使提交，高龄老人们也多半会让位于青壮年患者。
But I know that even when it comes to referrals, older people are more likely to give way to younger, older patients.
可我们，一介凡人，有什么资格做关于人命的筛选呢？那些在名单中衡量比较的时刻，让我看到命运与命运之间深藏的齿轮。
But what qualifications do we, mortals, have for screening human life? Those moments of comparison on the list give me a glimpse of the cog between fate and destiny.
我知道自己内心的一些东西永远被改变了，再也不会有毫无阴影的快乐，再也不可能有安坐书桌前的忘世。
I know something inside of me has been changed forever. There will be no more shadow-free happiness and no more forgetfulness in front of a desk.
失眠的夜里，我常搂着小孩，亲吻他温暖的头顶，感受他的体温。
On sleepless nights, I often hold the baby in my arms, kiss his warm head and feel his temperature.
想到有些人再也无法拥抱自己的孩子，有些人永远失去了父母，沉甸甸地知道自己是幸存者。
The thought that some people can no longer embrace their children, some forever lost their parents, heavy knowing that they are survivors.
我还活着，并非因为我比死去的人更加聪明、勤奋、善良，仅仅因为我幸运。
I am not living because I am wiser, more diligent, kinder, and luckier than the one who died.
但我不一定能一直幸运下去。
But I'm not always lucky.
我希望这段艰难浑噩的时间快些过去，可是想到那些死者、那些走投无路的人经历的苦难会慢慢被遗忘，一切恢复太平，仿佛什么都没发生过，就无法承受。
I hope the unexamined time will pass quickly, but the suffering of the dead, the desperate will be forgotten, and peace will return, as if nothing has happened and cannot be endured.
在志愿工作的空隙写下这篇文章，不过因为我也是一个怯懦、自私之人。
Write this article in the gap between volunteering, but because I am also a cowardly, selfish person.
我希望当我或我的亲友、国土之上任何区域的同胞，在不那么幸运的时候，也可以得到比较完善的保障。
I hope that when I or my friends and relatives, my compatriots in any region of the country, are less fortunate, they will be better protected.
我们这些幸存者，必须要为那些死去的人记录、奔走，大声说出他们的故事；因为如果我们不，那些苦难也终会在某一天，毫无修改地落到我们头上。
We, the survivors, must record, run and tell their stories aloud to those who have died; for if we do not, those miseries will one day fall upon us without modification.
最后，作为志愿者，我想总结一下热心网友可以更好帮到求助者的方法：1.看到求助信息时，点进求助者最新的状态或帖子下面的评论，查看他们（或网友）是否已经将信息上报到了人民日报、楚天都市报、侠客岛等渠道；2.如果都没有，可以帮助他们填写求助表格，很多求助者可能不太会用微博或者豆瓣，填好表后，请在评论中写上已提交，这样志愿者就不会重复收集信息；3.在无法明确提供帮助时，不要用短信和电话轰炸他们，消耗他们的精力和手机电量。
Finally, as a volunteer, I would like to summarize the ways in which enthusiastic netizens can better help their clients: 1. When you see the help message, click on the latest status or comment below to see if they have reported it to the People's Daily, Chu Tian Metropolis Daily, Chivalry Island, etc.
他们可能因为生病不便讲话，或在苦苦等待志愿者或社区的信息。
They may be unable to speak because of illness or are waiting for information from volunteers or the community.
4.如果看到求助者对医院、求助信息不了解，可以将微博博主@NCP生命支援 告诉他们，也可以分享医院床位信息：https://shimo.im/sheets/hPg9t9xT6GtkC3p8/MODOC这张表格的内容是目前最新最全面的，唯一的缺陷就是用手机查看不是特别方便。
4. If the caller is unaware of the hospital, the information can be shared with the microblogger @ NCP Life Support or with the hospital bed information at https: / / shimo.im / sheets / hPg9t9xT6GtkC3p8 / MODOC.
如果以上都做不到也不要苛责自己，尽可能地关爱自己与身边人也很重要。
If you can't do any of this, don't criticize yourself. It's also important to love yourself and the people around you as much as possible.
