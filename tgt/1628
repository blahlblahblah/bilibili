在武汉，登记在册的听障人士有1.3万人。
In Wuhan, 13,000 persons with hearing impairment are registered.
对这个群体而言，听力的阻隔带来不少困难，他们资讯获取滞后，对疫情的反应比正常人慢，防护物资也告急，甚至求援都成难题。
For this group, hearing barrier brings many difficulties, their access to information lags behind, their response to the epidemic is slower than that of normal people, and protective materials are in urgent need and even difficult to obtain help.
武汉市聋协2月11日的统计中，在汉聋哑人已有7例确诊，9例疑似，另有2例病逝。
Wuhan Deaf Association February 11 statistics, in Han deaf-mute people has been confirmed in seven cases, nine suspected, and two cases of death.

受访者供图文 |新京报记者魏芙蓉 实习生 杜萌编辑｜陈晓舒校对| 付春愔►本文约4598字，阅读全文约需9分钟2月10日，一张戴着氧气面罩的苍白面庞出现手机屏幕上时，志愿者卢小强被吓得倒吸一口凉气。
2007-9-25 09: 48 Chinese New Beijing News reporter Du Meng, editor, Chen Xiaoshu, proofread and read the full text about 4598 words. When a pale face in an oxygen mask appeared on the phone screen on February 10, Xiao Qiang, a volunteer, breathed a chill.
屏幕里，43岁的徐银文一身蓝白条纹相间的病号服，周围病床环绕。
On the screen, Xu Yinwen, 43, wears a blue-and-white-striped medical uniform surrounded by hospital beds.
聋哑人徐银文因急性阑尾炎在武汉市中心医院入院治疗已6天，这天，核酸检测结果呈阳性，他确认感染新冠肺炎，转入后湖院区。
Deaf-mute Xu Yinwen, who was admitted to Wuhan Central Hospital six days after suffering from acute appendicitis, tested positive for nucleic acid.
“我要口罩 20个”，这通视频，徐银文希望为妻儿准备20个口罩，“没有口罩，他们怎么来医院看我？”他有点着急，用手语表达着。
"I want 20 masks," said Xu Yinwen, who hopes to prepare 20 masks for his wife and children. "How do they come to the hospital without masks?" He said in sign language, worried.
在武汉，登记在册的听障人士有1.3万人。
In Wuhan, 13,000 persons with hearing impairment are registered.
对这个群体而言，听力的阻隔带来不少困难，他们资讯获取滞后，对疫情的反应比正常人慢，防护物资也告急，甚至求援都成难题。
For this group, hearing barrier brings many difficulties, their access to information lags behind, their response to the epidemic is slower than that of normal people, and protective materials are in urgent need and even difficult to obtain help.
武汉市聋协2月19日的统计中，在汉聋哑人已有24例确诊，10例疑似，6例死亡。
Wuhan Deaf Association February 19 statistics, in Han deaf-mute people have been diagnosed in 24 cases, 10 suspected cases, 6 deaths.
当下，“如何帮助武汉聋哑人”成为30岁的崔竟现在最为棘手的问题。
Now, "how to help Wuhan deaf mute" become 30-year-old Cui actually is the most thorny problem.
她也是一名听障人士，另一个身份是“守语者”公益小组的负责人，这个组织致力于改善听障人群沟通状况，团队成员也多为聋哑人，因为精通手语，且文字能力尚好，疫情期间，崔竟带领卢小强在内的7名志愿者，为武汉受困的聋哑人群提供定向帮扶。
She is also a hearing-impaired person, and is also the head of a public interest group called "The Guardian," which works to improve communication among people with hearing impairment. Her team members are mostly deaf and mute. She is fluent in sign language and has good written language skills.
聋哑病人入院的第一天，徐银文就感受到不便利。
Deaf-mute patient on the first day of admission, Xu Yinwen felt inconvenient.
陪床的弟弟短暂离开的半个小时里，有护士进来询问，他未做一字回应。
For half an hour after his brother left the bed, a nurse came in to ask him, but he did not reply.
“（哥哥）是外地人吗，好像听不懂本地话？”护士在弟弟返回病房后问道。
"Is he a stranger?" the nurse asked as his brother returned to the ward.
此后每当穿着防护服的医护人员进入病房，弟弟都会解释哥哥徐银文的特殊情况。
Every time the medical staff in protective clothing entered the ward, his brother would explain his brother Xu Yinwen's special situation.
确诊新冠肺炎转入后湖院区后，家属再不能陪床。
After the diagnosis of New Crown Pneumonia was transferred to Houhu District, the family could not stay in bed.
一个人住院期间，徐银文和医护人员的交流全部依靠纸笔。
During a person's hospitalization, Xu Yinwen and the medical staff's communication all rely on paper and pen.
“聋哑人就医不易”，崔竟深有体会，疫情之前，她时常受聋哑人病患委托前往医院做手语翻译，借助助听器，她可以把医生的话用手语转达给病患。
Before the outbreak, she was often entrusted by deaf and mute patients to go to the hospital for sign language interpretation. With the aid of hearing aids, she could convey the doctor's words to her patients in sign language.
医生的专业词汇和病人的病症表达对双方而言都是困难所在，崔竟在翻译过程中也会格外注意准确。
Doctor's professional vocabulary and patient's symptom expression are difficult for both sides, Cui unexpectedly also can pay special attention to the accuracy in the translation process.
但没有了手语翻译，大部分听障患者只能通过读唇、观察对方表情来辅助沟通。
But without sign language interpretation, most people with hearing impairment can only read their lips and observe each other's expressions to facilitate communication.
但防护衣和护目镜断送了这一可能，对于不擅书面语写作的徐银文来说，纸笔费时费力，却是当下唯一可行的沟通方式。
But protective clothing and goggles ruined the possibility, for Xu Yinwen, who was not good at writing, paper and pen took time and effort, but the only way to communicate was now possible.
和家人的沟通也只能通过微信消息。
Communication with family members can only be done through micromail messages.
徐银文打字慢、句式短，很多表达需要用图片替代。
Xu Yinwen type slow, short sentence, many expressions need to be replaced by pictures.
对家人，他报喜不报忧，每天的餐食、药品等都被他拍下照片传给家人，表达：自己营养均衡、恢复良好。
To his family, he was happy to report that every day he took pictures of food, medicine and so on to his family, to express his nutritionally balanced, well-recovered.
但是在打给志愿者卢小强的视频里，徐银文却难抑忧虑，他用手语告诉卢小强：因为自己在医院表达困难，和医护人员纸笔交谈有些内容看不懂，便不懂装懂。
But in the video call to volunteers Lu Xiaoqiang, Xu Yinwen can not help but worry, he told Lu Xiaoqiang in sign language: because he expressed difficulties in the hospital, and medical personnel and pen talk some content can not understand, do not understand.
“不懂装懂是聋哑人最常见的表现”，崔竟说，就疫情期间聋哑人的就医问题，“如何找到一种方式实现安全性和实用性的平衡？”她曾考虑过视频在线翻译，但最终因为实用性不佳而搁置计划。
"Ignorance is the most common expression of deaf people," Cui said. "How can we find a way to strike a balance between security and practicality during the epidemic?" She considered online video translation, but ended up shelving it because of poor practicality.
疫情下的武汉，对聋哑群体而言，听力的阻隔带来不少困难。
Wuhan under the epidemic situation, deaf-mute groups, hearing barrier brings a lot of difficulties.
不仅是就医困难，他们连基本的资讯获取都比正常人滞后，对疫情的反应也来得晚。
Not only is access to health care difficult, they even basic access to information than normal people are lagging behind, and the response to the epidemic is late.
防护物资告急，甚至求援都成难题。
Protective materials are in short supply, and even asking for help can be difficult.
30岁的崔竟出生在聋哑人家庭，父母都是聋哑人，崔竟在依靠助听器获得听力后，文字能力和资讯获取能力与正常人无异。
The 30-year-old Cui was born into a deaf-mute family with deaf and mute parents. Cui is no different from a normal person in being able to read and write with hearing aids.
她的另一个身份是武汉“守语者”公益小组的负责人，在她900名微信好友中，聋哑人士超过六成。
She is also the head of the Wuhan Group of Friends of the Guardian, where more than 60 percent of her 900 micro-friends are deaf and mute.
自1月22日以来，她不断收到来自聋哑人群的线上咨询，“我的社区在哪里？”“怎么在网上买口罩？”“残联电话，我要怎么打？”“因为交流的不便，在过去很多聋哑人几乎是与社区脱离的。
Since January 22, she has been receiving online advice from deaf people, "Where is my community?" "How do I buy masks online?" "How can I do that?"
”崔竟还提到，因为疫情而不得不面临的线上购物、快递收付等问题，也在很多中老年聋哑人的生活习惯之外。
Cui also mentioned that online shopping, courier collection and payment, which had to be faced because of the epidemic, were also out of the way for many deaf and mute middle-aged people.
“他们对疫情反应迟缓”“守语者”的抗疫行动，便是从新闻资讯的普及开始的。
"Their slow response to the epidemic" and "The Guardian" of the epidemic began with the spread of news.
“守语者”和其他公益团队先后翻译制作了“如何居家隔离”、“如何预防粪口传播”、“如何使用防疫物资”等多条手语视频。
The Guardian and other pro bono teams have translated and produced videos on how to isolate people at home, how to prevent the spread of feces, and how to use epidemic prevention materials.
这些都是崔竟挑选的“实用”、“权威”、“重要”的资讯。
These are the "practical," "authoritative" and "important" information that Cui has chosen.
2月5日，崔竟在朋友圈发布了一条手语视频。
On February 5, Cui actually released a sign language video in his circle of friends.
这一天，她被朋友告知，朋友的聋人父亲不顾家人劝阻聚众打麻将，直到家人无奈报警，数位聚众打麻将的聋哑人才被遣散。
On this day, she was told by friends that the deaf father of a friend ignored his family's attempts to dissuade them from playing Mahjong until their families were forced to call the police.
视频里，崔竟眉头紧蹙、手势飞快，用手语强调：“疫情严重，人传人，聚众打麻将易感染，明知故犯，无异于犯罪！”在武汉，登记在册的听障人士有近万人。
In the video, Cui frowned and gestured quickly, emphasizing in sign language: "The epidemic is serious, from person to person, gathering people to play mahjong easy to infect, knowingly committing crimes, is tantamount to committing crimes!
聋人圈子小，事情传得快，聚众打麻将的聋人父亲一天接了数个视频电话。
The deaf community is small, things spread fast, and the deaf father who gathers together to play Mahjong receives several video calls a day.
他一进门就挥舞双手跟女儿吵起来：“全武汉的聋人都跑来跟我视频讲道理！”崔竟制作的手语视频截图。
As soon as he came in, he quarreled with his daughter with his hands: "Deaf people all over Wuhan come to talk to me on video!" Cui actually made a video clip of sign language.
受访者供图这都归结于聋哑人群体对疫情的反应迟缓，从疫情的刚开始，他们获取资讯就显得比正常人要滞后许多。
Respondents put it all down to the slow response of deaf people to the epidemic, and from the onset of the epidemic, their access to information was much slower than normal.
1月20日前后，在钟南山发布新冠肺炎“人传人”后，崔竟已然重视起来，除夕夜的“团年饭”，亲戚齐聚，在她的强调下，菜盘和火锅盆里都备好了公筷。
On or about January 20, after Zhong Nan Shan "person-to-person" new crown pneumonia, Cui has already attached importance to the New Year's Eve "reunion dinner," relatives gathered together, under her emphasis, dishes and hot pot prepared chopsticks.
她不断把相关的新闻资讯分享到家族群和聋哑人群里，告知大家要防护。
She keeps sharing the news with her family and deaf-mutes, telling them to protect themselves.
但得到回应却是——“小题大做”，她的聋哑人父母并没有当回事；而在同城的聋哑人微信群里，崔竟的建议不但没有被重视，甚至被指“添乱”。
But in response - "making a fuss," her deaf-mute parents were not taken seriously, and Cui's advice was not only ignored, but even "added fuss" among the deaf and dumb in her town.
1月23日，武汉关闭离汉通道，市内公共交通暂停。
On January 23, Wuhan closed the Han corridor, the city's public transport was suspended.
不少老年聋哑人在这天出门乘公交，发现公交久等不至，来群里询问，被群友一通视频电话解释之后，这才明白出了什么事。
Many deaf and mute people in this day out on the bus, found that the bus did not wait too long, to the group asked, was a group of friends a video phone interpretation, then understand what happened.
卢小强是“守语者”的线上志愿者，他发现，自己的聋哑人母亲同样信息滞后。
Lu Xiaoqiang, an online volunteer for "The Guardian," found his deaf-mute mother similarly lagged behind in information.
平日里54岁的母亲独自在家，卢小强忙于工作，此前未曾跟母亲强调任何疫情资讯。
Usually 54-year-old mother at home alone, Lu Xiaoqiang busy work, had not stressed any epidemic information with his mother.
直到1月23日，卢小强从外地回到老家，母亲才问起他，“为什么外面很多人都戴起了口罩？”“守语者”针对聋哑人的疫情需求登记工作中，问到“为什么没有及时准备物资？”得到的回答几乎如出一辙：“新闻频率太快，没有手语翻译”；“我们聋人看不懂新闻，不清楚外面发生什么事，等反应过来，所有的药店都买不到口罩了”。
It was not until January 23, when Lu returned to his hometown, that his mother asked him, "Why are so many people wearing masks outside?"
崔竟说，在聋哑人群体中，中老年聋哑人资讯尤为落后，“他们更喜欢看手语，对文字理解能力会不及年轻聋哑人”。
Cui said the deaf and mute are particularly backward in information among the deaf and mute. "They prefer sign language and have less understanding of words than young deaf people."
最让她放心不下的是66岁的大姨，聋哑、独居，住所位于汉口火车站附近，那里确诊人数多，是疫情“高危地”。
She was most worried about the 66-year-old aunt, deaf and single, who lives near Hankou railway station, where the number of confirmed cases is "high-risk".
而且大姨从不使用网络，几乎与所有的新闻资讯绝缘。
And auntie never uses the Internet, and is almost entirely insulated from news and information.
崔竟唯一的办法是每天用短信和大姨保持联系，在了解老人的身体状况的同时帮她普及疫情资讯。
The only way Cui could do was to keep in touch with her aunt by text message every day to help spread the word about the epidemic while keeping track of the old man's health.
即使如此，2月14日，大姨还是瞒着崔竟出门了，并在事后表示惊讶，“店铺怎么都关门了？”崔竟气极了，大姨至今仍不明白疫情“轻重”，但细想之下她又觉酸楚，还有多少聋哑人有着和大姨一样的处境呢？2月10日，崔竟和志愿者在物资派送的过程中。
Even so, on February 14, Aunt Cui went out without telling Cui, and later expressed surprise, "Why are the shops closed?" Cui was so angry that Aunt Cui still didn't understand the severity of the outbreak.
受访者供图无声的救援2月初，由崔竟主导，三位听人（听力正常的人）、五名聋人组成的抗疫队伍临时集结了起来，计划在疫情期间为受困的湖北聋哑人提供支持。
Interviewees offered silent relief in early February, led by Cui, a three-person (hearing-neutral), five deaf anti-epidemic team temporarily assembled to provide support to the deaf and mute in stranded Hubei during the outbreak.
“看到找到我的老年聋哑人，我会想起独自在家的大姨，我老去的聋人父母，还有我自己。
"Seeing how old deaf people find me, I think of my aunt at home alone, my deaf parents who are always gone, and myself.
”事后，崔竟在“守语者”公众号提到这次志愿活动的初衷。
"Cui then mentioned the original purpose of the campaign in the public" Guardian. "
8名成员精通手语且文字能力尚好，均来自“守语者”公益小组，这一组织由崔竟在2014年创立，旨在为听觉特殊的人群创造平等沟通的机会。
Eight members are sign language-savvy and well-written members of the "Guardian" public interest group, founded by Cui in 2014 to create equal communication opportunities for people with special hearing needs.
行动之初，为摸清聋哑人群的困难和需求，“守语者”和其他志愿团队合作，一份面向湖北残障人士的问卷在网络发放。
At the beginning of the campaign, a questionnaire for people with disabilities in Hubei province was distributed online to find out the difficulties and needs of deaf people.
但事后崔竟发现，回收的200余份问卷中，只有一份是来自聋哑人。
But Cui actually found that after the recovery of more than 200 questionnaires, only one is from deaf mute.
事实上，“听”“说”的障碍无处不在，“寻求帮助的聋人很多是完全使用手语的、且文字能力不太好的，在他们的日常生活中，问卷很少见，基本上不会遇到，他们也不会填写。
In fact, barriers to listening and speaking are ubiquitous. "Many deaf people who seek help are completely sign language-using and have poor written language skills. Questionnaires are rare in their daily lives, rarely encountered and not filled in by them.
”崔竟在事后总结。
Cui concluded after the fact.
2月8日，募集到一批物资后，崔竟在“守语者”的微信公号上发布一则自己录制的手语视频，她鼓励有困难的湖北聋哑人士报名申领物资、进行需求登记。
On Feb. 8, after collecting a batch of materials, Cui posted a video of her own sign language on the official letter of the Guardian. She encouraged deaf people in difficulty in Hubei to apply for materials and register their needs.
与以往不同的是，填写问卷不再是唯一渠道，添加志愿者的微信后，聋哑人士可以直接和志愿者视频进行需求登记，有三名志愿者20小时在线提供手语沟通支持。
Unlike in the past, when questionnaires were no longer the only channel, deaf people were able to register their needs directly with a volunteer video, and three volunteers were able to provide sign language communication support online for 20 hours.
不到两天的时间里，超过150名聋哑人前来求援。
In less than two days, more than 150 deaf and mute people came to ask for help.
在崔竟的统计中，求助者有95%都是老年人，“他们以手语作为母语，在文字交流上存在较大困难”，这些老人，后来成为崔竟和志愿者们主要的帮扶目标。
Cui's statistics show that 95 percent of all sufferers are elderly. "They use sign language as their mother tongue and have great difficulty communicating words.
求助者收到志愿者派送的物资。
The supplicants received supplies sent by the volunteers.
受访者供图2月9日这天，视频通话不断，志愿者卢小强有些应接不暇，经常是在打字的过程中，文字还没发出，他就被突然弹出的视频电话邀请“抖”进了新的聊天界面。
The volunteers, Lu Xiaoqiang, were inundated with video calls on Feb. 9. He was asked to "shake" into the new chat interface before words were typed.
电话接通，不出意外，屏幕上大多是中老年人的脸。
Telephone access, no accident, the screen is mostly elderly faces.
在卢小强例行的文字询问中，老人往往文字回复速度慢，句式短，大多更习惯手语沟通。
Lu Xiaoqiang in the routine text inquiry, the elderly often slow word recovery, short sentence, most are more accustomed to sign language communication.
这时候卢小强就会主动邀请对方进行视频通话。
At this time Lu Xiaoqiang will take the initiative to invite each other for video calls.
“我要检查针”，9日，微信上一名聋人向卢小强发来文字。
"I want to check the needle," on the 9th, a deaf person sent a message to Lu Xiaoqiang.
“检查针？”卢小强心里疑惑，立即发出了视频邀请。
"Check needle?" Lu Xiaoqiang in the heart doubt, immediately issued a video invitation.
“发热去医院，检查用到”，举起手机面对面的时候，这名聋哑老人用手语跟他解释，“不知道叫什么词，看起来像一根针”，老人补充。
"Fever to the hospital, check it out", the deaf-mute old man explained to him in sign language, "I don't know what the name is, it looks like a needle," the old man added.
卢小强明白了，是体温计，他也了解到，老人71岁了，夫妻都是聋哑人，儿女不在身边。
Lu Xiaoqiang understood, is the thermometer, he also learned that the old man 71 years old, the husband and wife are deaf mute, the children are not around.
驶向聋哑人的物资车多日来，8名志愿者帮助的中老年聋哑人有百余名，虽然数量不大，但过程并不容易。
For days, eight volunteers helped more than 100 deaf, mute and middle-aged people. Though the numbers were small, the process was not easy.
有聋哑人快递丢件，打来视频求助，崔竟需要和对方花费1小时回溯派件过程，最后发现问题出在数天前，因为聋人无法听到来电提示，忽略了派件信息；一个46岁的聋人在丰巢的快递柜前犯了难，崔竟通过微信视频在线“教学”，花费半小时，对方才终于取回了快递；即使是关于快递单号的修改，只要打开视频手语交流，往往也要花费半小时……此前崔竟募集到一批爱心物资，因为沟通疏忽导致它们均以到付的方式被寄往武汉各聋哑申请人家中，而“守语者”服务的中老年聋哑人大多不会接收快递，更别说到付。
Cui had to spend an hour backtracking with his partner when he called for help. He found out that a 46-year-old deaf man had been unable to hear a phone call and ignored a message.
崔竟在第一时间要来了所有的快递单号，以便随时跟踪进程。
Cui actually wants all the courier number in the first time, in order to keep track of the process.
同城的物资派送，崔竟会尽量避免使用快递；如果遇上给聋人寄件，崔竟一定会在收件人名字后面备注：聋人，请发信息。
With the delivery of materials from the same city, Cui will try to avoid using express delivery. If he sends mail to deaf people, Cui will surely note after the recipient's name: Deaf, please send message.
2月10日，在收到中国红十字会基金会救援分队捐赠的一批物资后，崔竟决定第一时间内派送给求助的聋哑人士。
On February 10, after receiving a donation from the Rescue Unit of the Chinese Red Cross Foundation, Cui decided to send it to deaf people in the first place.
“守语者”志愿者接受中国红十字会基金会救援分队捐赠。
Volunteers of "The Guardian" receive donations from the Chinese Red Cross Foundation Rescue Team.
图源受访者崔竟的聋人父亲不放心，也跟着一起出了门。
Cui's deaf father, a source interviewee, was not at ease and went out with him.
一辆鄂A牌的物资车，贴上了社区开具的通行证，载着父女俩和志愿者三名听障者，横跨武汉的各个城区。
A E-E material vehicle, affixed with a community pass, carries two parents and three volunteers with hearing impairments across the city of Wuhan.
一路上，负责联系的崔竟忙个没停，“完全没办法将视线移开手机”。
Along the way, the contact Cui actually did not stop, "there is no way to look away from the mobile phone."
不管什么时候，“通知”对聋人而言都是个大问题。
Notices are a big problem for deaf people at all times.
是发短信呢还是打电话？“电话铃声听不到，如果手机不在身边，不论如何我们都是无法联系上聋人的”，如果短信通知就意味着更长的时耗，因而这一天，崔竟需要提前几个小时联系聋人，视频电话不接就一遍遍发短信，以确保他们在派送的时间段注意手机。
If the phone doesn't ring, we can't get in touch with the deaf anyway if the phone isn't around. "If text messaging means more time consuming, Cui needs to contact deaf people several hours in advance and send messages over and over again to make sure they pay attention to the phone at the time of delivery.
考虑到潜在的交叉感染风险，派送物资的过程避免直接接触，84消毒片和口罩往往会由崔竟的父亲提前放置在小区的板凳上、窗户口、路灯下等一些固定位置，待对方赶来取走后，再由崔竟在安全距离内当场用手语告知其使用方法。
Taking into account the potential risk of cross-infection, the delivery process avoids direct contact. Disinfectant tablets and masks are often placed by Cui's father on the bench, window and street lamp of the community in advance.
派送前，崔竟和父亲在分配物资。
Before he was sent, Cui and his father were distributing supplies.
受访者供图在到达武汉市汉阳区赛博园小区门口后，崔竟站在远处，看见自己事先放置在门卫处的袋装84消毒片被对面的人拿到手后，这才走近。
When the interviewee got to the gate of Saibo Garden in Hanyang district of Wuhan city, Cui actually stood in the distance and saw his bag of 84 disinfectant tablets which he had placed in front of the guard office.
眼前的女人一身黑棉衣，露出红色家居裤，借着车前灯，崔竟在距离她2米左右的位置停住脚步。
In front of the woman in black cotton clothes, revealing red home pants, thanks to headlights, Cui actually stopped about 2 meters from her position.
“一颗消毒片，一瓶水，500ml，静置完全溶解。
"One disinfectant, one bottle of water, 500ml, completely dissolved in the stillness.
”崔竟打着手语，一个空的矿泉水瓶被她紧握在手，作出84消毒片的使用示范。
Cui was playing in sign language, and she held an empty mineral water bottle in her hand to demonstrate the use of the 84 disinfectant tablets.
“谢谢你”，对面的女人也挥手回应，“注意安全”。
"Thank you," the woman across the way waved back. "Please be careful."
类似的无声对话重复在武汉的各个小区上演，从下午6点至凌晨1点，经过7小时的派送，84消毒片、口罩和体温计等物资最终被分赠给30个聋人家庭。
Similar silent conversations were repeated in various districts of Wuhan, where supplies such as disinfectant tablets, masks and thermometers were eventually donated to 30 deaf families after seven hours of delivery.
这是崔竟在疫情期间为数不多的一次外出，车辆载着她驶过武汉三镇，在城区中心的高架桥上，作为唯一行驶的车辆，崔竟第一次发现，高架桥一侧成幢的30层高楼房，家家户户都亮堂。
It was one of Cui's few trips during the epidemic, driving her across the town of Wuhan on the viaduct in the center of the city. Cui found for the first time that the 30-storey building on the side of the viaduct lit up every house.
而曾经的武汉中心城区，如今人车寥寥，崔竟戴着助听器的耳朵也听不到城市声响，她怀念起街市的热闹，还有每周二周五，在汉口江滩的手语角，那曾是聋哑人的盛事。
But once the central city of Wuhan, now few people, Cui even wearing hearing aid ears can not hear the city sounds, she missed the bustle of the market, and every Tuesday, Friday, at Hankou beach sign language corner, which was once a great event for the deaf and dumb.
