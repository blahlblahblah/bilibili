一个月以来，武汉300多家酒店为一万多名医护人员和志愿者提供了十万多间夜的住宿接待。
Over the past month, more than 300 hotels in Wuhan have provided more than 100,000 overnight stays for more than 10,000 medical staff and volunteers.
如果没有妥善的补充和接济，他们快支撑不下去了。
Without proper replenishment and sustenance, they will not be able to sustain themselves.
文 |《财经》记者万珮编辑 | 宋玮疫情中心武汉已经“封城”一个月有余，这给身在城中的酒店从业者带来了前所未有的挑战。
Caijing reporter Wan Pere & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; &
因为客流趋零，他们无法营业导致“颗粒无收”，同时依然要承担相应的房租、人力等成本。
As the flow of passengers to zero, they are unable to operate resulting in "no harvest," while still have to bear the corresponding rent, manpower and other costs.
更现实的情况是，受“封城”影响，市内公共交通停摆，武汉市从物理上被切割成无数孤立的单元，医护人员的上下班随之成为一道难题。
More realistically, under the influence of the "blockade," the city's public transportation was suspended and Wuhan was physically cut into numerous isolated units, making commuting by medical staff a problem.
在此情况下，即使自身面临不小的经济压力，这些酒店经营者们还是第一时间站出来，为奋战在一线的医生、护士提供庇身之所。
In this case, even if they face considerable economic pressure, these hotel operators are the first to stand up for the front-line doctors and nurses to provide shelter.
这意味着，在原来的经济损失之外，业主还要负担额外每月数万元的水电费。
This means that in addition to the original economic loss, the owner will have to bear tens of thousands of dollars a month in utilities.
酒店从业者赵明对《财经》记者表示，根本不敢仔细算账。
Zhao Ming, a hotel operator, told Caijing that he did not dare to calculate carefully.
赵明说，现在每天一睁眼，身上就压着二十余万元的贷款，为了维持正常周转，他从亲戚那边筹了一笔钱暂时补上了资金缺口。
Zhao Ming said that now every day open his eyes, on the body pressure of more than 200,000 yuan loans, in order to maintain normal turnover, he from relatives raised a sum of money to temporarily fill the gap.
最初与赵明一起参与救援的武汉各类型酒店有300多家，他们自发组织了“武汉医护酒店支援联盟”（以下简称“联盟”）。
The Wuhan Hotels Support League (Wuhan Healthcare Hotels Support Union) was organized spontaneously by more than 300 Wuhan Hotels participating in the rescue with Zhao Ming.
这个联盟成立于除夕之夜（1月24日），一个月以来，为一万多名医护人员和志愿者提供了十万多间夜的住宿接待。
Founded on New Year's Eve (Jan. 24), the alliance has provided more than 100,000 overnight stays for more than 10,000 health workers and volunteers over the past month.
但疫情仍在持续，一部分酒店已无力承担高企的开支，不得不退出救助计划。
But the epidemic continues, with some hotels unable to afford the high costs and having to pull out of the bailout.
1月31日，联盟发布公告称武汉地区159家单体酒店、民宿、公寓和小型连锁酒店将不再接待医护人员和客人。
On January 31, the league issued a notice saying that 159 individual hotels, residences, apartments and small hotel chains in Wuhan would no longer receive medical staff and guests.
联盟发起人之一，环球旅讯创始人李超透露，联盟开始运作以来，酒店业主们仅仅是水电费和布草等消耗就超过250万元。
Since the Alliance began operating, hotel owners have spent more than 2.5 million yuan on utilities and cloths alone, according to Globe Travel founder Lee Chao.
多数酒店工作人员已经极度疲惫，酒店的物资和卫生状况亦达到极限，这使得酒店的运营和服务处于极大风险之中。
Most hotel staff are exhausted and the hotel's material and sanitary conditions are at their limits, putting the hotel's operations and services at great risk.
迄今，武汉还有50余家中小型酒店在奋力坚持。
So far, Wuhan has more than 50 small and medium-sized hotels in the struggle to persist.
赵明在听到这个数字后自我调侃，“这很让人欣慰了，我恍惚觉得是不是只剩我一家。
Zhao Ming joked to himself when he heard the number. "It's comforting. I wonder if I'm the only one left.
”1参与守卫武汉1月23日上午10时，武汉被按下暂停键。
Wuhan was suspended at 10 a.m. on January 23, 2007, when Wuhan was involved in guarding the city.
于这座孤立的疫城中，一边是极具传染性且捉摸不定的病毒，另一边是与日俱增的资金、物资、医疗压力。
On one side of the isolated plague city is a highly contagious and elusive virus, on the other is mounting financial, material, and medical stress.
身在城中的人必须奋力自救。
He that is in town must help himself.
一群酒店人就此汇集起来。
A group of hoteliers came together.
90后女孩肖雅星是联盟的首位发起人。
90-year-old Xiao Yaxing is the first founder of the league.
在疫情之初，她把自己手中的四家酒店拿出来，用以解决医护人员的住宿问题，同时通过网络、OTA平台寻找无中央空调、条件适当的酒店一起加入。
At the beginning of the epidemic, she offered her four hotels to help with the accommodation of health-care workers and joined them via the Internet and the OTA platform to find suitable hotels without central air conditioning.
很快地，这个号召得到300多家酒店的响应。
Soon, the call was echoed by more than 300 hotels.
根据联盟数据，一个月以来，联盟已经为超过一万多名医护人员和志愿者们提供了十万多间夜的住宿接待。
Over the past month, the Alliance has provided more than 100,000 overnight stays for more than 10,000 health-care workers and volunteers, according to Alliance data.
为了解决在营运中出现的物资短缺问题，她又把酒店改造成临时仓库，四面八方的物资汇到她这儿，口罩、方便食品、消毒物品等，不一而足，然后由她调配、分发。
To address the shortage of supplies in operation, she turned the hotel into a temporary warehouse where supplies from all directions were sent to her, such as masks, ready-to-eat items, disinfectant items, etc., which she then deployed and distributed.
联盟成为了抗疫的中转站，酒店信息，医护需求、物资接纳都要全盘负责。
The Alliance has become a transit point for fighting the epidemic, with hotel information, medical needs, and material reception taking full responsibility.
肖雅星忙得时间根本不够用。
Xiao Yaxing has not enough time.
通常情况下，她每天早上8点被电话打醒，到晚上1点后才能睡下。
Normally, she is woken up by the phone at 8am every morning and cannot go to bed until after 1pm.
赵明是土生土长的武汉人，他的酒店位置临近协和医院。
Zhao Ming is a native of Wuhan, his hotel location near Concorde Hospital.
1月25日，他把空置的房间开放出来给该院的医护人员免费居住。
On 25 January, he opened the vacant room for the hospital's medical staff to live free of charge.
在做这一决定时，他几乎没有多想，“看到医生、护士睡在办公室的地板上，我总想做点什么。
In making this decision, he thought little. "Seeing the doctors and nurses sleeping on the floor of the office, I always wanted to do something.
”《财经》记者采访的多位酒店业主表示，除了提供房间、负责接待外，他们还需要对酒店公共区域进行清洁消毒和供应基本的物资。
Hotel owners interviewed by Caijing said they were required to clean and disinfect public areas and provide essential supplies in addition to providing rooms and reception.
这段时间，刘东和他的合伙人就睡在酒店，“两个老板亲自干活，每天消毒，冒着风险拉物资。
During this time, Liu Dong and his partner slept at the hotel. "The two bosses work in person, disinfecting each day and dragging their supplies at risk.
”尽管中间有一批酒店因经营风险退出，联盟还是在继续战斗。
The Alliance continued to fight despite the withdrawal of a number of hotels in the middle because of operational risks.
2月25日，联盟开发的“日月同城”医护酒店平台上线，以实现医护住宿需求和供应的在线匹配。
On February 25, the "Sun-Moon Tongcheng" health-care hotel platform was launched to match the demand and supply of medical and nursing accommodation online.
上线不到12小时，已经有28家酒店注册，提供共计1042个房间，医护人员发布住宿需求34个。
Less than 12 hours after the launch, 28 hotels have been registered, providing a total of 1,042 rooms, and 34 accommodation needs have been issued by medical personnel.
很多片段是温暖的。
Many of the clips are warm.
周清慧记得很清楚，在除夕当晚，一个医护人员，从十几公里之外，徒步三小时赶到酒店。
Chow remembered clearly that on New Year's Eve, a paramedic arrived at the hotel on foot for three hours from a distance of ten kilometers.
其间横跨了一座长江大桥，三条大街。
It straddles a bridge over the Yangtze River, three streets.
这一下戳中她的内心，“脱下白大褂，他也只是一个十八九岁的小伙儿。
He poked her in the heart. "Take off your white coat, he's only a boy of eighteen or nine.
”魏然对一个外号叫“梅超风”的医生印象深刻。
Wei was impressed by a doctor called "Mei Xianfeng."
梅医生三十多岁、热心肠，总是笑嘻嘻。
Dr. May is in his thirties, warm-hearted and always smiling.
他把店里琐碎的工作都负责起来了——他会开车接送消杀组的工作人员，也会帮大家采买基本物资。
He took responsibility for all the little jobs in the store - he would drive the disinfection crew and pick up the basics.
有一次，酒店的微波炉因为超负荷工作坏掉了，他为了买新的，开车满城跑，一家家地问。
Once, the hotel microwave oven because of overload work broke down, he to buy a new, driving around the city, the house asked.
平日里互不相识的人们将善意在无声中传递。
People who do not know each other in the day will convey goodwill in silence.
为了避免交叉感染，医护人员和酒店业主之间鲜有直接交流。
To avoid cross-infection, there is little direct communication between healthcare professionals and hotel owners.
但碰见时总会相视一笑，再各自离开。
But always meet each other smile, and then leave.
这是相互鼓励的信号。
This is a sign of mutual encouragement.
一次，周清慧上楼给一个医护送饭，对方小心翼翼地将门缝移开二十多公分，过程中没有寒暄，但那扇半开的门，和欲言又止的眼神让她充分感受到对方的感激。
Once Zhou Qinghui went upstairs to deliver food to a doctor. The other side carefully slit the door more than twenty centimeters away. There was no greeting, but the half-open door and the silent look left her feeling grateful.
在这些酒店人眼中，医护人员是抵御病毒的第一道防线。
In the eyes of these hoteliers, health care workers are the first line of defense against the virus.
一旦这道防线被攻破，这座城市也会陷入危难之中。
Once this line of defence is breached, the city will be in peril.
守卫他们就是守卫自己。
To guard them is to guard themselves.
2借钱过日子超乎多数人的想象，这是一场持久战。
2.Borrowing money to live beyond most people's imagination is a protracted war.
赵明在自己经营的酒店中一待就是32天，他的活动范围几乎被限制在眼下仅三十平米的酒店前台处，在大部分时间里，他和往常一样坐在工作台后的椅子上。
After spending 32 days at his hotel, Zhao confined himself to the front desk of his hotel, which is now only 30 square metres, and spent most of the time sitting in his usual chair behind the counter.
但进出的医护人员、玻璃门外冷清的街道又时刻提醒他，这还是病毒肆虐的武汉。
But in and out of the medical personnel, glass doors and deserted streets remind him that this is still a virus ravaging Wuhan.
最初的两个星期非常难熬。
The first two weeks were very hard.
医护人员上下班时间完全没有规律，“什么时间都有”，为了能及时给他们开门，赵明整块的休息时间只有凌晨3点到6点半。
In order to open the door for them in time, Zhao Ming's rest time is only between 3: 30 a.m. and 6: 30 a.m.
这一情况在后期得到缓解。
This situation was alleviated at a later stage.
“大家熟悉了，可以互相帮忙开门。
"Everyone is familiar and can help each other open the door.
”这是漫长的32天，无法规律休息只是开端。
It was a long 32 days, and irregular rest was only the beginning.
一位酒店主称最难扛的是资金压力。
One hotelier said the hardest thing to carry was financial pressure.
以他的情况来看，每个月单算水电费就两万余元，而在没有收入的当下，确确实实是笔不小的开支。
In his case, the cost of utilities per month alone is more than 20,000 yuan, but in the absence of income, is really a considerable expenditure.
赵明现在每天一睁眼，身上就压着二十余万元的贷款，为了维持资金的正常周转，他从亲戚那边筹了一笔钱暂时补上了资金缺口。
Zhao Ming now has to open his eyes every day, on the body pressure more than 200,000 yuan of loans, in order to maintain the normal turnover of funds, he raised a relative to temporarily fill the financing gap.
酒店业主周清慧同样告诉《财经》记者，她目前也在找一些低利息的贷款途径，以维持酒店的经营。
Zhou Qinghui, the hotel owner, also told Caijing that she was also looking for low-interest loans to keep the hotel afloat.
“要借钱过日子了。
"To live on borrowed money.
”这是当前多位酒店业主的际遇。
"This is the current situation of many hotel owners.
李超告诉《财经》记者，现在这些中小酒店最主要的补贴来自于携程、飞猪等平台的免佣金政策。
Li told Caijing that the main subsidy for these small and medium-sized hotels now comes from the commission-free policy of Ctrip, Pig and other platforms.
至于政府的补贴，周清慧称，有一些框架性的文件，但目前还没有看到正式落地。
As for government subsidies, Zhou Qinghui said there are some framework documents, but so far they have not officially landed.
在一天天看不到尽头的消耗中，赵明的心态发生了微妙的变化——他愈发意识到钱是重要的。
As the day wore on, Zhao Ming's mind underwent a subtle change - he became more aware that money was important.
最开始有人找上门来捐钱，他一口回绝，“医护人员在一线拼命，我做这点事情怎么好意思拿钱？”第二次他开始犹豫，“实在太缺钱了”；第三次在反复权衡下，他决定接受，“保洁阿姨还指着工资过日子。
At first someone came to the door to donate money, he refused. "Medical staff are desperate, I do this how good to get money?" The second time he began to hesitate, "really too short of money"; the third time, on reflection, he decided to accept, "Aunt Procter still points to salary.
”还有大部分单体酒店申请不到公益基金的相关补助，“通常情况下，公益基金支出合规要求高、手续复杂，这些酒店在前期没有登记接待医护的具体明细和证明材料，拿到补贴的难度特别大。
Most individual hotels do not apply for grants from public benefit funds, and "it is often difficult to get a subsidy because of the high compliance and complexity of public interest fund expenditures and the fact that these hotels did not register specific details and supporting documents for medical care in the previous period."
”一位知情人士表示。
A person familiar with the matter said.
活下去比什么都重要。
To live is more important than anything.
周清慧在脑海中闪过裁员的念头，她不敢多想，只是在最坏的一步到来前，提前与管理层做好铺垫。
Chou flashed through her mind at the thought of layoffs. She didn't dare to think much about it.
“在听到可能要裁员减薪时，其中一个副总经理流泪了。
"One of the vice-presidents cried when he heard about possible layoffs and pay cuts.
”她说。
'she said.
在弹尽粮绝的情况下，大多数中小酒店都希望能得到医院和政府的征用，一纸小小的征用函意味着酒店的消毒、物资、人员配备都将得到保障，后期还被承诺给予一部分经济补偿。
With food running out, most small and medium-sized hotels want to be requisitioned by hospitals and the government. A small requisition letter means that the hotel will be sterilized, stocked, staffed and later promised some financial compensation.
2月2日，湖北省新型冠状病毒感染肺炎疫情防控指挥部印发《关于加强发热病人、发热疑似病人及密切接触者隔离救治和管理的通知》。
On February 2, the Command of Prevention and Control of the New Coronavirus Infection Pneumonia in Hubei Province issued the Notice on Strengthening the Isolation, Treatment and Management of Fever Patients, Suspected Patients with Fever and Close Contacts.
该通知称，各市、州、县立即征用位置相对独立、对周边环境影响小、具备水电气和清洁排污保障条件的宾馆、酒店、招待所等资源，迅速改造为集中隔离点。
According to the circular, cities, states and counties immediately requisitioned resources such as hotels, hotels and guest houses in relatively independent locations with little environmental impact on the surrounding areas and equipped with water, electricity, gas and clean sewage facilities, and were rapidly transformed into centralized isolation points.
周清慧表示，能被政府征用是当前的最优选择，不过她尝试过提交申请并无下文。
Zhou Qinghui said being expropriated by the government was the best option at the moment, but her attempts to submit an application were not followed up.
据《财经》记者了解，政府征用的大部分是高星、连锁酒店。
According to "Caijing" reporter understands, the government requisitioned is Gao Xing, the chain hotel.
一位酒店业主称，政府会优先考虑体量大，设施齐全，离定点医院、隔离点近的酒店。
One hotel owner said the government would give priority to large, well-equipped hotels close to designated hospitals and isolation points.
与不具备征用资格的酒店不同，赵明一共接到过5次征用电话，但摆在他眼前的是一个两难的抉择。
Unlike hotels that do not qualify for expropriation, Zhao Ming has received five requisition calls, but faces a dilemma.
一旦被征用，原本住在酒店的医护人员将全部被清退。
Once requisitioned, all medical staff who used to stay in the hotel will be removed.
他坦言在经济压力如此大的情况下，中间确实有过犹豫，最后还是选择了坚守，“实在是于心不忍。
He admitted that in the face of so much economic pressure, there was indeed hesitation, and finally chose to stick to it, "is really intolerable."
”对留下的人而言，困难接踵而来。
For those who remained, difficulties followed.
赵明的酒店位于居民区内，一些社区工作人员和居民不能理解，这会极大增加同小区人员感染的可能性。
Zhao Ming's hotel is located in a residential area that some community workers and residents do not understand, which greatly increases the likelihood of co-infection.
“从他们说话的态度可以感觉到，一部分人认可我在做好事，一部分人甚至认为我在找麻烦。
"There is a feeling in the way they talk that some people think I'm doing good, some even think I'm in trouble.
”陶康的处境更为艰难。
Taukang was in a more difficult situation.
“社区不允许接待医务人员和雷神山务工人员。
"The community does not allow medical personnel and Raytheon workers to be received.
”但还是接待了，他考虑到这些务工人员工作条件艰苦，没有被安置好，“他们有人都快一个星期没洗澡了。
"But he did, considering that the men had worked in difficult conditions and had not been placed." Some of them haven't bathed in a week.
”这导致他位于海天大厦的公寓一度被社区强制断水断电，最后只能于2月18日停止营业。
As a result, his apartment in the Haitian tower was forced out of service by the community for a time before it could only close on February 18.
钱从哪里来？现金流还能支撑多久？员工怎么办？酒店未来怎么办？突如其来的疫情将问题一下全抛给了这些酒店人。
Where did the money come from? How long could the cash flow last? What about the staff? What about the future of the hotel? The sudden outbreak of the disease threw all the problems to the hoteliers.
没有比这更艰难的处境。
There is no more difficult situation.
赵明说，只能撑一天算一天，借不到钱的时候，该卖房子就卖房子，该转酒店就转酒店。
Zhao Ming said that only one day a day, when the money can not borrow, the house sold on the transfer hotel transfer hotel.
根据STR数据,1月26日全国入住率跌至17%。
Nationwide occupancy fell to 17% on January 26, according to STR data.
中金研报认为，餐饮、酒店、旅游、非必需品零售类企业短期业绩受损较明显，但总体趋势是“先抑后扬”。
CICC said short-term earnings losses were more pronounced in restaurants, hotels, tourism and retail non-essentials, but the general trend was to "restrain later."
对比非典，国内旅游人次在2003年下滑1％、但在2004年增长27％，星级酒店RevPAR在2003年取得3％的下滑、但在2004年取得16％的增长。
In contrast to SARS, domestic tourist arrivals declined by 1 per cent in 2003 but increased by 27 per cent in 2004, while star-rated hotels, RevPAR, registered a 3 per cent decline in 2003 but a 16 per cent increase in 2004.
2020年充满挑战，但撑过去也是必然。
The year 2020 is challenging, but it is also inevitable.
在曙光到来前，这些酒店业主们无畏风险，完成了一次又一次的“逆行”。
Before dawn, these hotel owners are fearless risk, completed time and again "retrograde".
陶康是一名退伍军人，他对这个国家和城市的热爱是刻在骨子里的。
Taokang is a veteran whose love for the country and the city is deeply engraved in his heart.
在酒店被迫停业后，他提交了防控志愿者申请，经历一个月艰难的等待后终于被征用，成为武汉街道上众多站岗执勤人员中的一份子。
After being forced out of business, he submitted an application for the prevention and control of volunteers. After a month of hard waiting, he was finally requisitioned as part of a crowd of guards on Wuhan's streets.
他告诉《财经》记者，“我做的还远远不够。
"I haven't done enough," he told Caijing.
