“如果当时大家都重视这个事情，或许不会有今天的疫情暴发。
"If people had taken this seriously, maybe there would not have been an outbreak like this.
”李文亮说。
'he said.
全文2320字，阅读约需4分钟事发近一个月后，武汉公布疫情的8名“造谣者”，被中国疾控中心流行病学首席科学家曾光，称赞为“事前诸葛亮”。
Nearly a month after reading the story, Wuhan released eight rumors about the outbreak, which was praised as "Zhuge Liang" by Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist at the China CDC.
其中一人，是武汉市中心医院眼科医生李文亮，新京报记者从李文亮处了解到，2019年12月30日下午5点43分，他在同学群里提到，“华南水果海鲜市场确诊了7例SARS”。
One of them, Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital, learned from Li Wenliang that on December 30, 2019, at 5: 43 p.m., he told a group of students, "South China fruit seafood market confirmed seven cases of SARS."
一个小时后，他在群里补充称，“最新消息是冠状病毒感染确定了，正在进行病毒分型”。
An hour later, he added in the group, "The latest news is that the coronavirus infection has been confirmed and the virus is being typed."
据武汉卫健委2019年12月31日发布的消息，近期部分医疗机构发现接诊的多例肺炎病例，与华南海鲜城有关联，目前已发现27例病例，其中7例病情严重。
According to Wuhan Health Commission on December 31, 2019, several cases of pneumonia have been found in some medical institutions, linked to Huaxian City, and 27 cases have been found so far, seven of which are serious.

Respondents to the picture on December 30, 2019, Lee Wenliang in the university class of the virus detection report.
受访者供图2020年1月1日，武汉警方发布通报称，一些网民在不经核实的情况下，在网上发布、转发不实信息，造成不良社会影响。
Wuhan police issued a notice on January 1, 2020, saying that some netizens had published and forwarded false information online without verification, causing adverse social impact.
公安机关经调查核实，传唤8名违法人员，并依法进行了处理。
The public security organs, after investigation and verification, summoned eight illegal personnel and dealt with them according to law.
两天后，李文亮收到警方的训诫书，警方认定“华南水果海鲜市场确诊了7例SARS”的言论，不属实。
Two days later, Li Wenliang received the police precepts, the police confirmed that "South China fruit and seafood market confirmed seven cases of SARS," the statement is not true.
1月28日，最高人民法院微信公众号刊文谈及此事称，尽管新型肺炎并不是SARS，但是信息发布者发布的内容，并非完全捏造。
On January 28, the People's Supreme Court Weixin Public News reported that although the new pneumonia is not SARS, the information publisher's published content is not a complete fabrication.
如果社会公众当时听信了这个“谣言”，并且基于对SARS的恐慌而采取了佩戴口罩、严格消毒、避免再去野生动物市场等措施，这对我们今天更好地防控新型肺炎，可能是一件幸事。
If the public had listened to this "rumour," and based on fear of SARS, measures such as wearing masks, strictly disinfecting, and avoiding going to wildlife markets again would have been a boon to our efforts today to better control the new form of pneumonia.
“试图对一切不完全符合事实的信息都进行法律打击，既无法律上的必要，更无制度上的可能，甚至会让我们对谣言的打击走向法律正义价值的反面。
"Trying to crack down on all information that does not fully correspond to the facts is neither legally necessary nor institutionally possible, and may even lead us to the opposite of the value of legal justice in the fight against rumours."
”次日，武汉警方再次通报此事称，警方并未对上述8名进行拘留、警告和罚款，因这8人情节特别轻微，警方分别进行了批评和教育。
The following day, Wuhan police again informed the matter that the police did not detain, warn and fine the eight men, who were criticized and educated for their particularly minor circumstances.
中国疾控中心首席科学家曾光在接受采访时表示，“这8个人是可敬的，他们是忧国忧民，有一定见解的。
'These eight people are respectable, 'Zeng Guang, chief scientist at the China CDC, said in an interview.
作为公共卫生专家，希望同他们对话，希望从他们身上学点东西。
As a public health expert, I hope to talk to them and learn something from them.
”1月30日，李文亮接受新京报记者采访时提到，他认为自己不属于传谣，而是在提醒大家注意防范。
In an interview with the Beijing News on January 30, Li Wenliang said he did not consider himself a rumor but rather a cautionary tale.
“如果当时大家都重视这个事情，或许不会有今天的疫情暴发。
"If people had taken this seriously, maybe there would not have been an outbreak like this.
”李文亮说。

受访者供图━━━━━“我认为我不属于传谣，我是在提醒大家注意防范”新京报:为什么会被警方训诫？李文亮:2019年12月30日，我在大学班级群里发表了“武汉华南水果海鲜市场确诊7例SARS”的言论。

Li Wenliang: On December 30, 2019, in my university class, I made a speech about seven SARS cases diagnosed in the fruit and seafood market in south China.
之后，警方将我所说的内容定性为谣言，然后我就被训诫了。
After that, the police qualified what I said as a rumor, and I was reprimanded.
新京报:什么时候被警方训诫的？李文亮:2020年1月3日被训诫的，当天就回家了，警方没有拘留、警告、罚款。
When was the police reprimanded Li Wenliang: He was reprimanded on January 3, 2020, and returned home the same day.
另外7名被训诫者，我不认识，也不知道他们从事什么职业。
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what their profession is.
新京报:传播此消息的初衷是什么？李文华:我是武汉市中心医院眼科的一名医生，当时，有7名华南水果海鲜市场的人，到我们医院接受救治，之后被隔离。
Li Wenhua: I was an ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital when seven people from the South China Fruit and Seafood Market came to our hospital for treatment and were isolated.
最初，这7个人的检测结果显示，他们感染了SARS冠状病毒。
Initially, the seven people tested positive for the SARS coronavirus.
我在群里发这些消息，是想提醒大家及其亲人注意防范，我还在群里嘱咐大家，不要将该消息和检测报告外传，没想到很快（消息）被传出去了。
I sent this message to remind you and your loved ones to be on guard. I also told everyone in the group not to spread the news and the test report.
新京报:你认同传谣的定性吗？李文亮:我认为我不属于传谣，我是在提醒大家注意防范。
Li Wenliang: I don't think I belong to the rumor, I'm just calling attention to precaution.

The virus detection report was sent to me by my hospital colleague. The report showed that the test was done by Shenzhen Huada Gene Technology Co. Ltd., and the number of seven people infected was also told by my colleagues.
发完消息过了一个小时后，我又在班级群里做了进一步的说明，我说在我们医院隔离的7个人，确定是被冠状病毒感染的，但病毒类型还在分。
An hour after the announcement, I gave further instructions in the class. I said that the seven people isolated in our hospital must have been infected with coronavirus, but the virus type was still being distributed.
如果当时大家都重视这个事情，或许不会有今天的疫情暴发。
If everyone had taken this seriously, there might not have been the outbreak we have today.

受访者供图━━━━━疑似患新型冠状肺炎 康复后想继续回一线工作新京报:你是什么时候被感染的？李文亮:1月8日我接诊了一位82岁的女性眼科患者，当时她患急性闭角型青光眼，但没有发热等症状，结果第二天这位患者出现发热症状，CT结果显示，她的症状是“双肺磨玻璃样病变”，属于病毒性肺炎。
2007-9-25 21: 48 When did you get the infection I went to an 82-year-old female ophthalmologist who developed acute angle-closure glaucoma but had no fever. The next day, the patient developed fever and CT findings showed that she had "two lungs grind glass-like lesions," which is viral pneumonia.
后来，这位女患者被排除了常见病毒感染，支原体、衣原体感染等情况，但那个时候我们医院还没有检测确诊病人的试剂盒，所以当时没有给她确诊。
The woman was later ruled out for common viral infections, mycoplasma and chlamydia infection, but we did not have a test kit for the confirmed patient at that time, so she was not diagnosed.
当时很多人都不在意，我们医院也没做特殊的防护措施，和病人接触的时候我也大意了。
At that time many people did not care, our hospital did not do special protective measures, contact with patients when I was also careless.
后来，我因为发烧、咳嗽，于1月12日住院治疗，现在属于疑似患新型冠状肺炎病例。
Later, I was hospitalized on January 12 with a fever and a cough, and now I have a suspected case of new coronary pneumonia.

呼吸困难，插着氧气管，不能起床、说话，偶尔看看手机，打字与别人交流。

刚开始挺担心的，但医生每天查房都会安慰我，我现在已经不发热了，精神状态比前几天要好，我相信医院和医生，我一定会被治好的。
I was worried at first, but the doctor's daily house check comforted me. I'm no longer feverish, I'm in better shape than I was a few days ago, and I'm sure the hospital and the doctor will cure me.
