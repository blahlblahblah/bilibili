今天，火神山医院正式交付。
Today, Mount Fujimori Hospital was officially delivered.
9天时间，可容纳1000张床位的医院在武汉落成，参照非典期间北京小汤山医院模式，专门收治新型冠状病毒肺炎患者。
The 1,000-bed hospital, built in Wuhan in nine days, is dedicated to treating patients with the new coronavirus pneumonia, following the example of the Xiaotangshan Hospital in Beijing during SARS.
在医院床位紧缺的情况之下，大家对火神山和雷神山给予了期望，而实际效果如何，能多大程度缓解目前的压力，还是未知数。
In the face of a shortage of hospital beds, expectations have been raised about Mount Fire and Mount Raytheon, and the actual effect and extent to which the current pressure can be alleviated are uncertain.
我们在2月1日晚，联系到了一位参与火神山医院项目的工程师，他已回到武汉家中，在家自主隔离，他向我们讲述了这些天的心路历程。
On the night of February 1, we contacted an engineer involved in the Mount Fujimori Hospital project who had returned to his home in Wuhan and isolated himself at home.
采访 | 二维酱口述 | 叶秋“你想去就去，保护好自己就行了”腊月26的时候，疫情的消息变得严峻起来，我跟媳妇开玩笑说，武汉有可能也要搞个“小汤山”，如果这样，我肯定得上。
AT & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45
因为我们单位在武汉算是龙头企业。
Because our unit is the leading enterprise in Wuhan.
除夕的前一天，我们得到了正式消息。
We got the official news the day before New Year's Eve.
领导在群里问了一句，有多少人在武汉？清点了一遍，拉了群，告诉我们：现在要建武汉“小汤山”，需要兄弟们顶上。
The leader asked a question in the group, how many people in Wuhan? Inventory, pull group, tell us: Now to build Wuhan "Xiaotangshan," need brothers atop.
有个兄弟先说了句“若有战，召必回”，然后所有人都齐刷刷地打出了这句话。
One of the brothers first said, "If there is a battle, call it back," and everyone typed it out in unison.
是的，“若有战，召必回，战必胜”，我们打的是一场没有退路的仗。
Yes, "if there is a battle, call it back, fight it out." We are fighting a war that has no way out.
收到消息的时候我在家里陪着两个娃看电影，享受难得的一家人在一起时光。
When I got the news, I stayed at home with two babies to watch a movie and enjoy spending time with a rare family.
公司头一天刚刚才刚开完会放假。
The company had just finished its meeting the day before.
在群里发消息时没有犹豫，但怎么跟家人说，我犹豫了。
I didn't hesitate to send messages in the group, but I hesitated to tell my family.
我晚饭的时候和媳妇说项目有点事，明天要去一下。
I told my wife over dinner that there was something wrong with the project. I had to go tomorrow.
想着先去看看情况，或许每天还能回来一趟。
I'd like to see the situation first and maybe come back every day.
但是媳妇太了解我了，起了疑心，一直追问我到半夜，问我到底要去干嘛。
But the daughter-in-law knew me so well that she became suspicious and kept asking me until midnight what I was going to do.
不得已之下，我才把手机递给她看。
I had to show her my cell phone.
我知道，现在出去，她肯定会很担心。
I know. now out, she's gonna be worried.
不过她看了之后，没说话，过了一会儿说，“你想去就去，保护好自己就行了。
But when she saw it, she said nothing, and after a while said, "You just go and protect yourself.
”其实我们已经得到一些信息，知道情况很严重，在医院工作的同学朋友很早就给我们打电话，说有人传人了，要我们戴好口罩，多注意。
In fact, we have received some information about the seriousness of the situation. Our classmates and friends at the hospital called us early to say that someone had passed us on and told us to put on our masks and pay more attention.
新型冠状病毒刚刚报道出来人传人的时候，有一个当医生的朋友给我发了个视频，里面有个上了年纪的老爹爹，只剩最后一口气了，奄奄一息坐在那儿，他老伴站在旁边哭，其实也快不行了，有气无力地喊着，谁能救救我们。
Just as the new coronavirus was being reported, a friend of a doctor sent me a video showing an elderly father with only one last breath left sitting dying. His wife was standing by crying.
朋友给我发这个视频，是想让我看看真实的情况，提醒我们和家里长辈多做工作，能不出门就别出门。
My friend sent me this video, is to let me see the real situation, remind us and the family elders to do more work, can not go out.
这个视频对我的触动其实挺大的，尤其是两位老人眼中流露出的对生命的渴望和对现实的绝望。
This video to my touch is actually quite big, especially in the eyes of the two old people expressed the desire for life and despair of reality.
我看了之后，心里很难受，跟我媳妇说我去洗个澡，然后冲着水偷偷流了会儿眼泪。
When I saw it, I felt very sad. I told my wife that I would take a bath and secretly shed a few tears.
当时我就对自己说要做点什么，不行就去中南医院做个志愿者帮帮忙，能出多少力出多少力。
At that time, I said to myself to do something, can not go to the South China Hospital as a volunteer to help, how much effort can be made.
没想到要去另外一个战场。
I didn't expect to go to another field.
其实在确定要去火神山前一天晚上的时候，我心里还是有点怕的。
In fact, in the determination to go to Mount Fire the night before, I was still a little afraid.
钟老爷子来了武汉之后，每一天确诊和疑似人数直线上升，武汉各家医院一床难求。
After the arrival of grandfather Zhong in Wuhan, every day the number of diagnosis and suspected number of straight up, Wuhan hospitals are difficult to find.
但是这里是武汉，这里是我的家，一个生我养我看着我成长的地方，我小学、中学、大学一直到结婚生子都在武汉。
But this is Wuhan, here is my home, a birth I raise me look at the place where I grew up, I primary school, middle school, college, all the way to get married and have children in Wuhan.
哪怕是工作后跟着单位走南闯北，全是跑遍了大半个中国，最后还是想在武汉，宁愿降薪也好，不升职也好，就想待在武汉。
Even after work followed by the unit to run north and south, all run half of China, or want to end up in Wuhan, would rather pay than promotion, just want to stay in Wuhan.
只有在武汉才能有那种家乡的感觉，没出去的时候没感觉，真的出去了，千言万语汇成的就是一句，我要回武汉。
Only in Wuhan can there be such a sense of home, not out when no feeling, really out, a thousand words is a convergence, I want to go back to Wuhan.
在武汉封城那天，前一天晚上十点左右知道消息，我问过媳妇要不要回她老家随州。
On the day that Wuhan closed the city, the night before about 10 o'clock news, I asked my daughter-in-law whether to return to her hometown Suizhou.
当时想法是媳妇老家有一个三百多平大院子，就算不出门两个娃过去了也可以开心地玩一会，后期武汉长期不出门，两个娃在家憋屈的很。
At that time, the idea was that her hometown has a 300-plus flat yard, even if you do not go out two babies can happily play for a while, later Wuhan long-term not to go out, two babies at home suffocate very.
但是转念一想，就算出去了，也是待在家里，这种时候，武汉出去的肯定不受待见。
But on second thought, even if out, also stay at home, this time, Wuhan out of the certainly not to be treated.
而且想着武汉的医疗条件怎么也比周边地区好，况且前期武汉都不够重视，周边地区更不会重视，后期疫情是什么情况真不好说，还不如在家关着不出门安心。
What's more, Wuhan medical condition is better than surrounding area, besides, Wuhan is not enough attention, the surrounding area will not pay attention to, what situation is difficult to say after the epidemic situation, rather than stay at home in peace.
我的两个孩子还比较小，儿子五岁，闺女七岁，还不太能理解这件事。
My two children are still young, my son is five, my daughter is seven, and I don't quite understand it.
给他们看了些视频，说现在外面很多人生病了，这个病传染性很强，我们要注意勤洗手、戴口罩。
Show them some videos, said that many people outside now sick, this disease is very infectious, we should pay attention to wash hands, wearing masks.
走之前，我跟他们说，“爸爸明天要出去打仗去了。
Before I left, I told them, Dad is going out to war tomorrow.
”我儿子还挺开心的，男孩子总是对打仗有一种莫名的渴望。
"My son was happy, and the boys always had an inexplicable desire to fight.
闺女倒是有点害怕，怯生生地和我说要我注意安全。
The girl was a little frightened, and timidly told me to be careful.
我跟领导说的第二天早上去报道，天没亮五点左右就出发了，从我家开车过去大概50公里。
I told the leader to report the next morning that he had left before around five o'clock, about 50 kilometers from my house.
出门的时候比较洒脱，什么也没带，因为想着车里有个简单的洗漱包和几件换洗衣服。
When I went out, I took nothing with me because I thought I had a simple toiletry bag and a few changes of clothes.
我当时觉得可能每天回，最多两三天也能回一趟家，后来发现根本回不来的。
I thought maybe I could go home every day, two or three days at the most, only to find that I couldn't get home at all.
有几天忙得忘记跟家人联系到工地的时候，已经有我们公司已经有三十多个管理人员到了，现场有一些挖机在工作，大概20多台。
A few days too busy to contact with family contact site, there have been our company has more than 30 management personnel, there are some digging machine at the scene, perhaps more than 20.
我主要负责集装箱的调配，分装，一方面联系厂家，从各地运过来，一方面跟设计对接。
I am mainly responsible for the deployment of containers, separate packaging, on the one hand contact manufacturers, from all over the transport, on the one hand with the design docking.
前几天集装箱没有施工的时候主要在工地上帮助协调现场，后面涉及到集装箱的拼装，要在外面拼好了，再送过来。
A few days ago when the container did not work mainly in the construction site to help coordinate the site, the back of the container involved in the assembly, to be completed outside, and then send.
所以需要不断往返跑，每天来回要过近十次临检。
So you need to keep running and going back and forth almost ten times a day.
在火神山周围有很多道临检，有的是测体温，有的是检查通行证、管理人员工作证。
Around Mount Fire, there are many spot checks, some temperature, others check pass, manager's work permit.
平均每天走的步数应该都能超过3万。
The average daily walk should be more than 30, 000.
手机这时候就成了一种负担，每次听着电话响起头皮就一阵发麻，因为这可能意味着新的变动，之前做的好多又是无用功。
The mobile phone becomes a burden, and each time the phone rings, the scalp becomes numb, because it may mean a new change, and much of what has been done before is useless.
刚过去的时候，每天都有很多朋友打电话来问我，是不是在火神山，那边情况怎么样，还有想看现场照片的。
Just past, every day a lot of friends called to ask me if it was in Mount Fire, how things were there, and wanted to see pictures of the scene.
多了就很烦，前前后后有上百个这样的电话，各种亲戚朋友同学都来问。
A lot of annoyance, before and after hundreds of such phone calls, a variety of relatives, friends and classmates to ask.
我能理解大家对这边的好奇，但是真的忙到没时间去和大家分享这边的见闻。
I can understand the curiosity, but I'm too busy to share what I've seen here.
大家的工作时间说是白天晚上两班倒，其实都没这么做，太累了回去休息一下，醒了第一时间又回到现场。
Everyone's work time said is day night two shifts, in fact did not do so, tired go back to rest, wake up the first time back to the scene.
我一般晚上工作到十一二点，早上一般五六点起床就去了。
I usually work until eleven or twelve in the evening, and I usually get up at five or six in the morning.
除夕那天是最忙的，第一天七点到工地，第二天中午吃了饭才回项目休息。
New Year's Eve is the busiest day, the first day at the construction site at 7, the next day after lunch before returning to the project rest.
对于什么时候跨年的之类的，真的没功夫去留意。
For when the New Year or something, really do not have time to pay attention.
有时候在工地上看到新来的同事，大家相互打个招呼说一句“新年快乐”，更多的就是一个礼貌的问候，这个时候，哪有人会有心情过年。
Sometimes at the construction site to see the new colleagues, we say hello to each other "Happy New Year," more is a polite greeting, this time, no one will be in the mood to celebrate the New Year.
我住的是周边项目的项目部，但是因为来的人比较多，后面到的兄弟们安排到了附近的宾馆。
I live in the project department of the surrounding project, but because of the large number of people coming, the later brothers arranged to stay in a nearby hotel.
工地上搭了几个大帐篷作为我们的临时补给点和检查点，到了饭点我们就去那边拿盒饭，一般有三四个菜。
Large tents were set up on the site to serve as temporary depots and check-points. At meal time we would go and fetch boxes of rice, usually three or four dishes.
拿好了，就在边上随便找个地方吃，大家都自觉保持一定的距离。
Take it, just find a place to eat on the edge, we all consciously maintain a certain distance.
我们在工地上，除了日常的安全帽之类的，就多了个口罩。
We had an extra mask on the construction site, in addition to the usual safety helmet or something.
从第三天开始，在帐篷这里有专门的人发放口罩，回收口罩，一天三次测量体温。
From the third day, a special person here in the tent distributes masks, resumes masks, and takes temperature three times a day.
这个病估计还是和个人免疫系统有关，平时在现场劳动多的人身体都还不错，基本没人出现问题，只有头两天因为下了雨施工有一两个人感冒了，谨慎起见还是对他们进行了隔离。
The disease is thought to be related to the immune system, and people who usually work more on the spot are in good health, with few problems, except for the first two days, when one or two people caught a cold because of rain, and were quarantined.
除了第一天资源还没调配到位，条件差一点，后面条件都挺好的，物资也比较充足。
In addition to the first day of resources has not been deployed, the conditions are poor, the conditions behind are quite good, the material is more adequate.
在这里也非常感谢许多热心人士的捐助，让我们在后勤采购方面的压力减轻不少。
Thank you very much for the contributions of so many enthusiasts, which has eased the pressure on our logistics procurement.
医院在这块的压力就比我们大多了。
The hospital is under a lot more pressure here than we are.
大年三十那天五医院防护用品弹尽粮绝，我有个在日本的朋友，托我去给在五院工作的父亲送点口罩，初一我起来第一件事就是赶到五医院，但我根本送不进去，请他们护士长出来拿但是他们用不了，因为我们口罩标准低，他们不能用。
I had a friend in Japan who asked me to send some masks to my father working in the five hospitals. The first thing I got up was to go to Five Hospital, but I couldn't get them.
我朋友父亲他是医院的外科一把刀，人手不够上一线了，在重症区隔离了我进不去。
My friend's father He's a surgeon's knife in the hospital, There's not enough staff on the front line, Isolated me in the critical area I can't get in.
打电话都是别人代为转告的。
All the calls were relayed by someone else.
他说，你回去安心做你的，我安心做我的，这次疫情过去了我们再一起喝杯酒。
'Go back to your senses, 'he said.' I'll make myself at ease. This epidemic is over. Let's have another drink. '
我现在不清楚他的情况，也不想去打听。
I don't know about him now, and I don't want to ask.
也许没消息就是最好的消息。
Maybe no news is the best news.
家里人有时会问几句情况怎么样了，保重身体之类的。
Sometimes the family asks a few questions about the situation, take care of your health or something.
但有几天是完全没联系，其实是我忙得忘记了。
But a few days is completely out of touch, in fact, I am too busy to forget.
在火神山跟在家是全然不同的心情，在家里出发前可能还有惶恐、害怕、紧张之类的情绪，出去了，什么乱七八糟的情绪都不会有。
Being at home on Mount Fire is a totally different mood. There may be panic, fear, nervousness and so on before leaving home.
所有的喜怒哀乐都是随着一些工作上的事情而波动，其他的事，根本没时间去想。
All moods and moods fluctuate along with something on the job. There's no time to think about anything else.
前几天阴雨，我们还很担心混凝土浇筑后的凝期问题。
A few days ago it was rainy and we were worried about the problem of coagulation after concrete pouring.
好在后面几天是晴天，天公作美，温度也好，给我们节约了很多时间。
Fortunately, the next few days are sunny, the weather is beautiful, the temperature is good, we saved a lot of time.
总体还是比较顺利的。
Overall, it was relatively smooth.
修建速度快，其实没什么好惊讶的，对我们开始就是一个工期特别紧的抢工项目，其实技术含量并不是那么大。
Construction speed, in fact, nothing surprising, for us is a particularly tight start to the project, in fact, the technical content is not so large.
外媒称赞“中国速度”，其实中国速度一直都很快，远比他们想象的快，中国的建筑行业是真的很强的。
Foreign media praised "Chinese speed," in fact, China has been very fast, far faster than they think, China's construction industry is really strong.
孩子想抱我，我赶紧拦住了吃饭的时候会看一下疫情相关的新闻，一个是看看数据，感染人数、死亡人数，看看有没有新的辟谣信息。
The baby wanted to hold me, so I stopped the dinner and read the news about the epidemic. One was to look at the numbers, the number of people infected, the number of people killed, to see if there was any new rumour-fighting information.
有些消息真的很好笑，比如昨天的双黄连。
Some news is really funny, such as yesterday's Shuanghuanglian.
其实昨天正好我有点咳嗽，就跑去药店买了些止咳药，随便拿了几盒药，里面就有双黄连。
In fact, I happened to cough a little yesterday, went to the drugstore to buy some cough medicine, casually took a few boxes of medicine, there is Shuanghuanglian.
晚上看到新闻，我还跟周围朋友开玩笑说，我这里有两盒双黄连，高价卖，一盒200。
When I saw the news at night, I joked with my friends around me that I had two boxes of Shuanghuanglian here, sold for a high price, a box of 200.
太假了，压根没效果。
It's too fake. It's just not working.
一个特大型研究所出这么一个没有任何依据的报告，我不知道他们的羞耻心在哪里。
I don't know where their shame lies when a mega-institute comes up with a report that has no basis.
网上火神山施工现场直播很火，我是很晚才知道，是朋友跟我打电话说起来。
On-line fire god mountain construction site live broadcast is very hot, I was very late to know, is a friend to call me to say.
取的外号我就知道一个“宋高宗”（汽车吊还是随车吊还真没弄清楚），知道是因为有同学非要我给他发个现场照片，我就随便拍了一下，他就说这是“宋高宗”啊，我有点懵，不知道什么意思，他还给我解释了半天。
I knew a "Song Gao Zong" by the nickname "Song Gaozong", knowing that because someone insisted that I send him a field photo, I patted it casually. He said it was "Song Gaozong".
还夹杂着什么小红小蓝之类的，我还真记不住，没法想象这一个个工程机械弄的和宠物一样的名字。
There was little red-blue or something, and I couldn't even remember the names of these engineering machines and pets.
施工现场拍摄有人和我说这个监控什么的非常高科技之类的，其实我们大多项目施工的时候也会安装监控，上面还会有当时的温度湿度扬尘状态的数据，就是日常工作的一部分，很平淡。
I was filmed at the construction site and I was told that this is very high-tech monitoring and so on. In fact, most of our projects will also be installed monitoring, there will be temperature and humidity dust state data, is part of the daily work, very insipid.
大家有这种兴趣应该是在家憋久了吧，要是能出去玩的话，谁想看人玩泥巴。
If you can go out to play, who wants to see people play with mud?
施工现场直播施工的时候其实没什么心情，包括知道可以回家了，也没什么感觉，只有抢工后的疲惫。
Construction site live construction when in fact not in the mood, including know can go home, there is no feeling, only after the fight tired.
这个施工任务其实不难，就是工期压力太紧，对完成任务还是比较有信心。
This construction task is not difficult in fact, is too tight schedule pressure, or to complete the task or more confident.
真的到家了，见到媳妇，见到孩子，还是觉得开心的。
Really home, see daughter-in-law, see the child, or feel happy.
看到我，孩子傻里傻气地说“爸爸终于回来了，我好想你”，他们想过来抱我，我赶紧给拦住了。
Seeing me, the child said foolishly, "Dad is home at last, I miss you so much." They wanted to come and hold me, and I stopped them quickly.
我当时还戴着口罩，衣服也没换。
I was still wearing a mask and I didn't change my clothes.
把衣服扔到洗衣机，清理好之后就把自己关在房间。
Throw your clothes in the washing machine, clean them up and shut yourself up in the room.
我有个特别好的兄弟，做警察的，大年初一开始发烧，到我回来前一天，他老婆还问我，能不能搞到免疫球蛋白，我帮他想办法弄了几支。
I had a really good brother, a cop, who had a fever on the first day of New Year, and the day before I got back, his wife asked me if I could get some immunoglobulins, and I helped him find some.
现在他在武昌医院住院，还没确诊，我托医生朋友看了下他的情况，基本是确诊了。
Now he is hospitalized in Wuchang Hospital, has not been confirmed, I entrusted the doctor friend to see his condition, is basically confirmed.
现在不光是确诊麻烦，要医院收你也很难，因为现在全是爆满的状态。
Now it's not just a matter of diagnosing trouble, it's also hard to get you to the hospital, because it's full now.
真的是一床难求。
It's really a bed hard to find.
今天回家了，要自我隔离，至少隔离一周吧。
Go home today. Isolate yourself. Isolate for at least a week.
所有吃的家人送进来。
All the family members who ate came in.
喉咙有点发炎，应该是咽炎犯了，去之前就有咽炎，一个多月了，现在还有点咳嗽。
Throat a bit agnail, should be pharyngitis made, go before there is pharyngitis, more than a month, still a bit cough.
在家里，偶尔可以戴着口罩去阳台，看看养的十几条金鱼，还有几盆兰花，我媳妇老家是兰花之乡。
At home, occasionally can wear a mask to the balcony, look at a dozen goldfish, there are a few pots of orchids, my daughter-in-law is the hometown of orchids.
孩子们喜欢小动物，之前养过仓鼠，蓝猫，但是孩子们常常在和小动物玩的时候被抓伤，就换了金鱼，安全第一。
Children like small animals, have previously owned hamsters, blue cats, but children often play with small animals when scratched, changed goldfish, safety first.
现在养了日寿、福寿、泰狮、猫狮，我回来时看见猫狮正在摇着尾巴啃青苔，看着他们在水里无忧无虑的游来游去，让人特别宁静。
Now that I have a birthday, a happy life, a lion and a lion, I come back to see the cats and lions wagging their tails and chewing lichen.
希望这次灾难大家都能平安度过吧。
I hope we can all get through this disaster safely.
