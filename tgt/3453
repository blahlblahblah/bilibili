与中国、意大利等国的积极应对不同，英国选择直接“躺平”，提出所谓的“群体免疫”计划，令各界震惊。
Unlike China and Italy, which have responded positively, the UK has shocked communities by choosing to "lie flat" and propose so-called "mass immunization" programs.
针对此举，CNN于14日评价，这是英国政府的一场豪赌，没人知道它会不会管用，只有时间会告诉我们。
CNN commented on the 14th that it was a huge gamble by the British government and no one knows if it will work. Only time will tell.
但无疑，此次新冠病毒危机，一定是英国首相约翰逊最糟糕的噩梦。
But there is no doubt that the new crown virus crisis must be the worst nightmare for British Prime Minister Gordon Johnson.
英国权威期刊《柳叶刀》主编为此则连发多条推特抨击，称这是拿公众的安危玩“轮盘赌注”，是个严重的错误。
The editor-in-chief of The Lancet, a leading British journal, launched a series of tweets calling it a grave mistake to gamble on the public's safety.
他呼吁政府分享其政策所依据的科学证据、数据、模型。
He called on Governments to share the scientific evidence, data, models on which their policies were based.
英国首相约翰逊 图自视频截图截至14日，英国新冠肺炎新增确诊数347例，累计达1145例。
British Prime Minister Gordon Johnson has confirmed 347 new cases of pneumonia in the UK, totaling 1,145 cases, as of Tuesday.
死亡新增10例，累计达21例。
There were 10 new deaths and a cumulative total of 21 cases.
在如此严峻的疫情面前，英国并没有像中国、意大利、或其他欧洲国家那样，采取严格的防控措施，而是采取温和举措，宣布将疫情应对措施从“遏制”阶段进入“延缓”阶段。
In the face of such a severe epidemic, the UK has not taken the stringent control measures that China, Italy, or other European countries have taken. Instead, it has taken the modest step of announcing a shift in the response from containment to "delay."
在此阶段，英国政府改变了检测方式，不再检测显示轻症的人，将重点放在症状较重的患者身上；同时还建议若出现咳嗽发烧等轻微症状患者，应在家中隔离7天，除非病情恶化，否则不建议叫救护车；此外，英国没有关闭学校，仅建议学校应停止组织出国旅游；以及70岁以上、身体状况堪忧的人不应该乘坐邮轮等。
At this stage, the British government changed the test away from people with mild symptoms and recommended that people with mild symptoms, such as cough and fever, should be kept in isolation for seven days. In addition, Britain did not close schools and only recommended that schools should stop organizing tours abroad.
英国官员们一再表示，他们是根据科学专家的建议而做的决定。
British officials have repeatedly said they made their decisions on the advice of scientific experts.
还声称，根据目前科学研究表明，从长远来看，建立对新冠病毒的群体免疫对国家是有益的。
It was also claimed that, according to current scientific research, the establishment of community immunization against the new crown virus would be beneficial to the country in the long term.
英国政府的科学专家也为这些举措辩解，称他们已经发现对于没有任何健康问题的患者来说，新冠病毒通常只会对其产生轻微症状，过程持续5天。
Scientific experts from the British government have defended the move, saying they have found that for people without any health problems, the new strain usually has only mild symptoms and lasts five days.
但对年老体弱的人来说，会引发一些免疫反应，从而造成许多致命伤害。
But for the elderly and the infirm, it triggers some immune response, which can cause a lot of fatal injuries.
专家们还认为，政府的最新举措能将新冠肺炎的高发期从传统流感季节的4月，延缓至夏季，届时会缓解医院所面临的压力。
Experts also believe the government's latest move could slow the peak season for pneumonia from April, the traditional flu season, to summer, easing the pressure on hospitals.
英国政府首席科学顾问CNN：英国正在豪赌然而这些做法却引发了外界巨大的争议。
CNN, chief scientific adviser to the British government: Britain is betting heavily but these practices are sparking huge controversy.
CNN报道称，英国重症病房一线医生已对此发出警告，倘若确诊病例数达到高峰，可能会出现缺少呼吸器等情况。
Frontline doctors at the UK's intensive care unit have warned of possible respiratory shortages if the number of confirmed cases peaks, CNN reported.
再倘若医生护士也被感染了，届时人手严重不足的情况会使疫情加剧。
If doctors and nurses were infected, the severe understaffing would exacerbate the epidemic.
英国前卫生大臣杰里米·亨特 （Jeremy Hunt）为此感到担忧：我们只有4周的时间就会达到目前意大利所处的阶段，然而我们却什么都没做。
Jeremy Hunt, the former UK health minister, is worried: we have only four weeks to get to where Italy is, and we are doing nothing.
世卫组织发言人玛格丽特·哈里斯（Margaret Harris）则对“群体免疫”的计划表示质疑，称每一种病毒在人体内的作用是不同的，并刺激不同的免疫系统。
Margaret Harris, a WHO spokesman, questioned plans for "mass immunization," saying that each virus acts differently in the body and stimulates different immune systems.
“我们可以讨论理论，但目前我们面临的是一个现实的情况，我们必须考虑采取行动”。
"We can talk about theory, but at the moment we have a reality and we have to think about action," he said.
连日来，英国权威期刊《柳叶刀》主编理查德·霍顿也发布数条推特，抨击英国应对疫情的方法。
For days, Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of the leading British journal The Lancet, posted several tweets criticizing the UK's response to the epidemic.
他指责英国政府的决策并不是根据科学做出的，而是在拿公众的安危玩“轮盘赌注”，是个重大的错误。
He accused the British government of making "roulette bets" on the safety of the public rather than on the basis of science.
理查德表示，14日包括他在内的多位英国公共卫生专家，在《泰晤士报》上发表了一封公开信，指出英国应对疫情的方法明显与大多数国家不同，且没有任何迹象表明，英国的决策是根据别国遏制病毒的经验做出的，呼吁英国政府公布所做决策的依据、数据、模型。
Richard said he and a number of British public health experts, including him, published an open letter in The Times on the 14th, pointing out that the British approach to the epidemic was clearly different from that of most countries, and that there was no indication that UK policy was based on the experience of other countries in containing the virus.
“没有完全的开放，就会丧失公众信任”，理查德表示，这种透明度对保持科学界、医学界和公众的理解、合作、信任至关重要。
"Without full openness, there is a loss of public trust," said Richard, who said such transparency was essential to maintaining understanding, cooperation and trust among the scientific community, the medical community and the public.
同一天，数百名科学界人士也向英国政府发出两封公开信，对其政策感到担忧，呼吁采取紧急措施，在英国扩大社交距离等。
On the same day, hundreds of scientists also sent two open letters to the British government expressing concern about its policies and calling for urgent measures to expand social distance in the UK.
CNN报道解释说，英国之所以没有采取“社会疏离”的举措，是因为其专家预测疫情高峰将在14周后才会来临，人们不愿为此改变自身的生活方式，也不愿在三个多月的时间里遵守新规。
The CNN report explains that the UK did not act "socially alienated" because its experts predicted a 14-week peak, and people were reluctant to change their lifestyles or abide by the new rules for more than three months.
理查德则认为，政府低估了公众的理解和行动力。
Richard argues that the government underestimated the public's understanding and ability to act.
他还强调自己并不是危言耸听，意大利正在发生的一切都是真实的。
He also stressed that he was not alarmist and that what was happening in Italy was true.
而英国政府还没有为应对这些做好准备。
And the British government is not ready to deal with them.
他还呼吁立即果断的采取“封城”等措施。
He also called for immediate and decisive steps such as "sealing the city."
不过，也有人对英国的应对政策表示支持。
But there was also support for Britain's policy response.
伦敦政治经济学院教授Clare Wenham就表示，我们没有足够的证据表明关闭学校能够遏制新冠病毒的传播，但约翰逊正在听取专家们的意见，他采取了一种相当谨慎的方法。
'We don't have enough evidence that shutting down schools will stop the spread of the new crown virus, 'says Clare Wenham, a professor at the London School of Political Economy.
“这的确是一场赌博”。
"It was really a gamble."
她认为政府的首要任务是避免引发公众恐慌，并确保公众配合防控举措，“如果错了，就是一场政治赌博”。
She said the government's priority was to avoid public panic and to ensure that the public cooperated with prevention and control efforts, "if it is wrong, it is a political gamble."
CNN报道指出，唐宁街似乎认为，从长远地看，新冠病毒引发的恐慌可能比病毒本身更危险。
Downing Street seems to believe that the fear caused by the new crown virus could be more dangerous in the long run than the virus itself, CNN reported.
英国此次“独树一帜”的赌博，没人知道会不会管用，只有时间会告诉我们。
Britain's "unique" gambling, no one knows if it will work, only time will tell us.
报道还称，这一次，新冠病毒危机是约翰逊最可怕的噩梦，令其陷入了一种独特的困境。
The report also said the new crown virus crisis was Johnson's worst nightmare, leaving him in a unique predicament.
约翰逊在应对此次疫情危机的同时，英国的下一个脱欧期限——7月1日也正在倒计时。
As Johnson copes with the epidemic, the countdown to Britain's next Brexit deadline, July 1, is well under way.
根据协议，脱欧过渡期只持续到今年底。
According to the agreement, the Brexit transition will last only until the end of this year.
如果英国和欧盟在7月1日之前尚未就谈判取得实质性进展，那双方将在7月1日就是否将过渡期延期做出决定。
If the United Kingdom and the European Union do not make substantive progress on the negotiations by 1 July, the parties will decide on 1 July whether to extend the transition period.
报道质问，若与欧盟的谈判被疫情耽误，导致进展缓慢，到6月底都没能达成任何协议的话，约翰逊是否会为了挽回颜面，而去冒食品、药品和其他物资短缺的风险。
The report questioned whether Johnson would risk running out of food, medicine and other supplies to save face if negotiations with the European Union were delayed and progress slowed until no agreement was reached by the end of June.
相比起应对疫情，英国政府更乐于在经济领域采取果断行动。
The British government is more willing to take decisive action on the economic front than it is to respond to the epidemic.
新上任的财政大臣里希·苏纳克（Rishi Sunak）本周在其公布的首份预算中提出了用于公共服务的应急资金。
Rishi Sunak, the new chancellor of the exchequer, this week proposed emergency funding for public services in his first budget.
英国央行也采取协同行动，下调利率并宣布刺激措施等。
The Bank of England also acted in concert, cutting interest rates and announcing stimulus measures.
英国早前表示，由于许多人未经诊断，可能有5000至10000人可能已感染新冠病毒。
Britain said earlier that as many as 5,000 to 10,000 people could be infected with the new crown virus because many people are undiagnosed.
