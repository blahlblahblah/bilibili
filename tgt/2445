我们医护人员只是整个事件的一个环节，降低死亡率、提升治愈率，靠的是国家总体布局，靠的是全体人民的共同参与。
Our health-care workers are only one part of the story, reducing mortality and improving cure rates, depending on the overall configuration of the country and on the participation of the entire population.
文 | 杨跃杰（郑州市第六人民医院重症隔离病区主任）1月25日，我进入“新冠”隔离病区，历时一个多月。
YANG Yuejie (director of severe quarantine at Zhengzhou Sixth People's Hospital) On January 25, I entered the "new crown" quarantine area for more than a month.
其间，我主要从事“新冠肺炎”重症、危重症患者救治，2月25日，我们病区所有的重症患者都脱离了生命危险，我也终于有时间把这个月的经历记录下来。
During that time, I was mainly engaged in "New Crown Pneumonia" severe, critical patients, February 25, all of our patients were life-threatening, I finally have time to record this month's experience.
新冠≠肺炎“新冠”和“新冠肺炎”应该是两个概念，现在只要一提到“新冠”，人们马上就以为“新冠肺炎”，其实不可以将二者等同起来。
The mere mention of a "new crown" of pneumonia and a new crown of pneumonia are two concepts that people now think of as "new crown pneumonia" without actually being equated.
该病毒主要侵犯人体呼吸系统，会不会侵犯人体其他脏器，研究的少，还没有时间去进一步研究对血液系统（免疫系统）、肝脏、肾脏、心脏乃至消化系统、中枢神经系统的损害，因此区分这两个概念有助于科学防治。
There is little time to study further the damage to the blood system (immune system), the liver, kidneys, heart and even the digestive and central nervous systems, so distinguishing between the two concepts helps scientific prevention and treatment.
“新冠”会不会垂直传播？患新冠肺炎产妇产下的新生儿，需要怎样预防，需要哪些监测指标去观察，还没有标准。
Is there vertical transmission of the new crown? There is no standard for what prevention and monitoring indicators are needed for newborns with new crown pneumonia.
“新冠”侵入人体后，人体对它的防御机制怎样，起初的反应怎样，是不是存在首次病毒血症，第二次病毒血症？病理生理怎样，还没提出，相信将来进入教科书会详尽描述。
What is the body's response to the new crown's invasion of the body, its initial reaction, first viremia, second viremia? Pathophysiology has not been proposed, I believe the future into the textbooks will be described in detail.
关于疫情的起因，怎样引起人类发病，目前还不清楚，但相信一定会有结论，而国家现在出台野生动物保护法律，有利于生态平衡、利于人类和谐共生。
The cause of the outbreak, how it causes human disease, is not clear, but we believe there will be a conclusion, and the country now has wildlife laws that are conducive to ecological balance and harmonious coexistence.
只有大家都遵守有关法律法规，才可能避免下一个危机。
The next crisis could be averted only if everyone abided by the relevant laws and regulations.
“新冠”核酸序列与SARS病毒相似度很高，都能引起呼吸系统损害，但在传染性、致死率方面有差别。
The Nucleic Acid sequence is similar to that of the SARS virus and can cause respiratory damage, but there are differences in infectious and fatal rates.
目前，发病者、隐性感染者是主要传染源，怎样避免隐性感染者献血，通过血液传播应该考虑。
At present, the pathogen, recessive infection is the main source of infection, how to avoid hidden infection donated blood, through blood transmission should be considered.
国家号召大家居家的举措，在没有疫苗广泛接种的情况下，是最有效的措施，但我相信，一旦疫苗问世，普遍接种，这个病的发病率在某种程度上就没那么可怕了。
The State's call to home is the most effective measure in the absence of widespread vaccination, but I believe that once the vaccine is available and universal vaccination, the incidence of the disease is somewhat less terrible.
如何预防？“新冠”传播途径主要是飞沫和接触，在比较密闭环境中，气溶胶可能传播；因此病患集中收治就是把传染源隔离起来，减少空气中病毒存在，加上大家戴口罩、勤洗手，就能减少发病或不发病。
How to prevent the spread of "new crowns" is mainly by droplets and contact, and aerosols can spread in relatively closed environments; thus, concentrated treatment isolates the source of infection, reduces the presence of viruses in the air, and reduces the incidence or absence of disease by wearing masks and washing hands frequently.
一些人拒绝戴口罩没能充分认识到它的必要性，当然问题也不能一刀切，在没有发病者的偏远乡村、空旷人烟稀少的地方可另当别论。
Some people refuse to wear masks without fully recognizing the need for them, and of course there is no one-size-fits-all solution, except in remote villages where there are no sufferers and where there are few people in the open.
时常看到一些倔犟之人，就是不戴口罩，危害自己也危害别人。
Often see some stubborn people, even do not wear masks, endangering their own harm to others.
勤洗手是常识，有句话叫做病从口入，新冠尽管呼吸道传播，但不排除粪口传播。
Frequent hand washing is common sense, there is a saying called disease from the mouth, the new crown although respiratory tract transmission, but does not exclude fecal transmission.
保持乐观心态面对每天生活，也是预防该病的良方，闷闷不乐，郁郁寡欢、心事重重会降低人体免疫力，不利于预防此病及其他疾病发生。
Staying optimistic about everyday life is also a good way to prevent the disease, and depression, depression and anxiety can lower your immune system and help prevent the disease and other diseases.
充足睡眠，每天6-8个小时，有利于健康。
Get enough sleep for 6-8 hours a day, which is good for your health.
合理饮食，碳水化合物、蛋白质、维生素每日摄入要合理，有利于人体免疫球蛋白合成，抵抗病毒。
Reasonable diet, carbohydrate, protein, vitamin daily intake should be reasonable, conducive to the synthesis of human immune globulin, anti-virus.
至于吸烟、饮酒有利于预防新冠已被证实是没有依据的。
There is no evidence that smoking and drinking help prevent new crowns.
治疗经验我所在的病区只收治确诊的重症、危重症患者。
Treatment Experience My ward only admitted patients with severe and critical illnesses.
数量不多，因此有一定的片面性。
The quantity is not big, therefore has certain one-sidedness.
氧疗上我们的原则是续惯性应用，鼻导管-面罩-高流量-有创插管-ECMO，免除了无创应用，因为高流量解决不了氧合，无创往往也没效果，所以直接有创。
Our principle in oxygen therapy is to continue inertial application, nasal catheter-mask-high-flow-invasive intubation-ECMO, which eliminates non-invasive applications, because high flow does not solve oxygen, non-invasive is often not effective, so directly invasive.
需要说的是，有些患者不配合氧疗。
It should be noted that some patients do not cooperate with oxygen therapy.
趁医务人员不注意，去掉氧疗，造成治疗被动。
While the medical staff is not paying attention, remove oxygen therapy, resulting in passive treatment.
有一例重症患者不配合氧疗。
In one case, the patient did not cooperate with oxygen therapy.
我花费近半个小时时间同其沟通：国家投入那么多人力、物力去救治你，医务人员冒着被感染的风险救治你，要配合，不为自己考虑，也要为大家考虑，为家庭考虑，要有敬畏之心，要有感恩之心；相信国家，相信医务人员，相信科学；氧疗、服药输液一定听从安排，不要任性。
I spent nearly half an hour communicating with them: the country invested so much manpower and material resources to treat you, medical staff risked being infected with you, to cooperate, not to think for themselves, to think for the family, to be feared, to be grateful; to trust the country, to believe in medical personnel, to believe in science; oxygen therapy, medication infusion must be obedient, not capricious.
经过交流之后，病人配合治疗，最终从重症转为轻症。
After communication, the patient cooperated with the treatment, and eventually from severe to mild illness.
抗病毒药物，从我观察的数例患者，干扰素、洛匹那韦/利托那疗效一般，一例重症患者抗病毒25天鼻咽拭子、血、痰仍核酸阳性，后改为磷酸氯喹，5天后血、咽、鼻拭子、痰全部转阴，不敢说它抗病毒效果最好，但证明有效。
Antiviral drugs, from my observation of several patients, interferon, Lopinavir / ritona efficacy, a 25-day antiviral patients, nasopharyngeal swab, blood, sputum still nucleic acid positive, later changed to chloroquine phosphate, 5 days after the blood, pharynx, nose swab, sputum all turned cloudy, do not say it is the best antiviral effect, but proved effective.
理论上来说，干扰素早期应该有效，随着病毒血症的进一步进展，大部分病毒聚集在肺部，其效果可能变差。
In theory, interferon should be effective in the early stages, and as viremia progresses further, most viruses congregate in the lungs and the effect may become worse.
相信安全有效药物以后会陆续被发现。
It is believed that safe and effective drugs will be discovered in the future.
患者病毒核酸出院后复阳，说明目前方案不尽完善，需不需要间歇疗法，值得去研究。
The patients with viral nucleic acid discharged from hospital Fuyang, indicating that the current plan is not perfect, need intermittent treatment, worth studying.
抗生素应用，早期应用是预防性细菌感染，可以说不需要“高级别”抗生素，随着住院时间延长或有创侵入操作，感染指标显现，确切了感染部位，就需要精准应用抗生素。
Antimicrobial use, an early use of prophylactic bacterial infections, can be said not to require "high-level" antibiotics. Precise application of antibiotics is required as hospitalization lasts longer or invasive procedures are performed, infection indicators become apparent and infection sites are identified.
我们所管理一位重症患者，肺部感染明确，抗生素应用级别较高，病情稍稳定后降级了，次日，患者出现体温、氧合不好，再次加上，症状好转。
We managed a critically ill patient with a definite lung infection, a high level of antibiotic use, a mild stabilization and a demotion. The next day, the patient had a bad temperature, oxygen, and again, the symptoms improved.
因此“降阶梯”节点要把握好；虽然是个案，但也说明一些问题。
Therefore, "down the ladder" node to grasp well; although it is a case, but also explained some problems.
抗真菌应用只有两三例，一例有确切证据，另两例只是预防性用药。
There were only two or three cases of antifungal use, one with conclusive evidence and two with prophylactic use.
糖皮质激素应用。
Glucocorticoid use.
大家都认同其双刃剑作用。
Everyone agrees with its double-edged sword.
所管患者在2周左右加重。
The number of patients under supervision increased by about 2 weeks.
我们经验，有转向危重症倾向者，早、小、短应用可能收益大，一旦出现“白肺”再应用略显迟了。
Our experience, there is a tendency to turn critical, early, small, short applications may yield large benefits, once "white lung" re-application slightly late.
“白肺”的出现可能与细胞因子风暴有关系，我们开展了细胞因子检测，鉴于数量较少，没有可以总结的，持续观察。
"White lung" may be associated with cytokine storms, we conducted cytokine testing, given the small number, there is no summative, continuous observation.
体液免疫抗体检测进行了个位数患者检测，由于个体差异，数据偏差大。
humoral immune antibody detection was carried out in single digit patients, due to individual differences, the data deviation is large.
丙种球蛋白所有患者都应用了，由于没有客观指标，所以没有总结。
gamma globulin was used in all patients, so there was no summary because there were no objective indicators.
呼吸机、ECMO参数的调节，模式的选择非常重要，但体会最大，患者收益最大的，是在此基础上进行的俯卧位，每天大于12小时，确实氧合改善明显。
Respirator, ECMO parameters of the regulation, mode selection is very important, but the biggest experience, the greatest benefit of patients, is carried out on the basis of the prone position, more than 12 hours a day, the oxygen is indeed significantly improved.
俯卧位需要医生护士多人参与，这时候医护体力消耗最大，被感染风险最高，要严格防护。
The prone position requires the participation of many doctors and nurses. At this time, medical and nursing staff consume the most and are at the highest risk of infection.
中医中药应用。
Traditional Chinese Medicine Application.
我们患者整个疗程都在应用，由于本人对中医不熟悉，没有总结。
Our patients throughout the course of treatment, because I am not familiar with traditional Chinese medicine, there is no summary.
睡眠，睡眠还是睡眠，体会较深。
Sleep, sleep or sleep, experience deeper.
四例重症患者转为轻症，他们的睡眠时间，在整个治疗过程中显得非同小可。
Four severe cases turned mild, and their sleep time was significant throughout the treatment.
在综合治疗的基础上，患者的睡眠时间引起病情波动，多次告诉我们不容忽视。
On the basis of comprehensive treatment, the patient's sleep time causes the condition fluctuation, many times tells us not to ignore.
每天除了病情交班，我都重点问一下患者晚上睡眠几个小时，多次提示，只要患者头天晚上睡眠少于6个小时，患者不同程度出现呼吸次数增加，氧合不好维持，起初并不很在意，往往考虑其他因素，但随着次数的增加，留意观察，患者睡眠大于6-8小时，氧合容易维持，病情相对稳定，反之则差。
In addition to the daily shift, I asked patients how many hours sleep at night, many times suggested that as long as the night before the patient sleep less than 6 hours, different degree of breathing increase, oxygen poor maintenance, often other factors, but as the number of times, pay attention to observation, patients sleep more than 6-8 hours, oxygen easy to maintain, relatively stable disease, and vice versa.
可能是巧合，但多次情况这样，不得不提示睡眠时间多少与病情稳定与恢复有关系，例数太少可能没有普遍意义。
It may be a coincidence, but in many cases, it is necessary to indicate how much sleep time is associated with stabilization and recovery. Too few cases may not have universal significance.
基于上述情况，我们都想法让患者充足睡眠，有时药物干预帮助其睡眠。
Based on the above, we all try to get patients to get enough sleep, and sometimes drug interventions help them sleep.
我们收治的首例患者，在转为轻症前几天内，白天也睡几个小时，加快了恢复进程。
The first patient we treated slept for several hours during the day, just a few days before the onset of mild illness, accelerating the recovery process.
对于轻症、普通型患者，我没有机会接触他们。
For mild, ordinary patients, I do not have access to them.
总之，患者的康复，需要方方面面，任何细节都很重要，没有哪一个方法是万能的，国家提出，科学救治、精准施策是真理，一个疾病的防治，靠各个部门协同合作。
In a word, the patient's recovery needs all aspects, any details are important, no one method is omnipotent, the state said, scientific treatment, accurate policy is the truth, a disease prevention and control, rely on the collaboration of all sectors.
我们医护人员只是整个事件的一个环节，降低死亡率、提升治愈率，靠的是国家总体布局，靠的是全体人民的共同参与。
Our health-care workers are only one part of the story, reducing mortality and improving cure rates, depending on the overall configuration of the country and on the participation of the entire population.
以上有些观点可能错误，希望指正。
Some of the above points may be wrong, hope to correct.
