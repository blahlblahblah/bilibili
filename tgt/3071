隔离在伊朗的日子口述 | 孙建龙采访、文 | 杨溪1当地时间3月5日上午十点半，我的一位伊朗朋友在德黑兰南部汽车站等待巴士，准备前往另一座城市伊斯法罕。
At 10: 30 a.m. local time on March 5, an Iranian friend of mine waited at Tehran's southern bus station for a bus to another city, Isfahan.
人比以往少了许多。
There are far fewer people than before.
他看到一支车队浩浩荡荡赶到汽车站，皮卡车上满载着消毒液。
He saw a convoy of vehicles loaded with disinfectant rushing to the bus station.
车队停下后，身穿防护服的消毒人员背着消毒液，集合拍照，还有当地媒体随行。
When the convoy stopped, disinfectants dressed in protective clothing carried disinfectant on their backs, assembled for photographs and were accompanied by local media.
对方很友善，看到我朋友后，送给他一双防护手套，并告诉他不要靠近队伍。
He was very friendly. When he saw my friend, he gave him a pair of protective gloves and told him not to come near the team.
过去的一个多星期里，伊朗开始根据现有的防疫物资，在地铁站、巴士站进行初步的大范围消毒。
In the past week or so, Iran has begun preliminary extensive disinfection of subway and bus stops based on existing epidemic prevention materials.
汽车站大厅入口处，也有工作人员拿着额温枪对来往旅客进行体温检测。
At the entrance to the bus station lobby, a staff member also carries a frontal temperature gun to check the temperature of commuters.
但车站内外，戴口罩的人依然不多。
But the number of people wearing masks is still low inside and outside the station.
我住在德黑兰北部，是浙江一家贸易公司外派常驻伊朗的职员。
I live in the north of Teheran and am a resident of a Zhejiang trading company based in Iran.
自从伊朗卫生部2月19日宣布境内出现新冠病毒肺炎确诊病例后，我就没有再出门。
I have not been out of the house since the Health Ministry announced a confirmed case of Newcastle virus pneumonia on February 19.
除我以外，公司在当地还雇佣了几名伊朗员工，我们最近都是在家办公。
In addition to me, the company employs several Iranian employees locally, and we have been working from home recently.
虽然当地政府对疫情有隐瞒的成分，但是我这边目前一切正常。
The local government has something to hide about the outbreak, but things are fine on my side.
因为之前也听说过一些小道消息，所以提前做了些准备，买了很多蔬菜和肉存在冰箱里，有鸡翅、牛肉、猪肉、白菜、土豆、辣椒……都是耐放的，起码够吃一个多月。
Because I've heard a lot about it before, I made preparations to buy a lot of vegetables and meat in the fridge. There were chicken wings, beef, pork, cabbage, potatoes, chilies... all durable, enough for at least a month.
德黑兰有几家大超市，商品比较齐全，最近因为疫情，超市一到晚上基本被抢购一空，每个人的购物车都堆得满满的。
There are several large supermarkets in Tehran, complete with good wares, and recently the supermarket has been almost empty by the end of the night because of the epidemic, and everyone's shopping cart is full.
除此之外，街上还有很多小卖部，一条街可能就开了几十家。
In addition, there are many street outlets, a street may be opened dozens of.
总的来说，伊朗现在物资还是挺充足的，不过最近物价涨了很多，尤其是生姜和大蒜——伊朗人认为有预防作用——现在差不多60元人民币一公斤，涨了一倍多。
In general, Iran is well stocked, but prices have gone up a lot recently, especially ginger and garlic, which Iranians believe have a preventive effect, now more than double to about Rmb60 a kilogram.
口罩也涨价了，而且现在已经买不到了。
The price of masks has also risen, and they are no longer available.
2月19日那天，药店突然开始排队，库存一下子都卖掉了。
On February 19th, the drugstore suddenly began to queue, and all of a sudden the stock was sold.
以前普通医用口罩大概是人民币两三毛一个，后来涨到三四块，N95口罩从五块涨到了三十几块。
The average medical mask used to be two or three cents a month, then rose to three or four, and the N95 mask rose from five to about thirty.
一开始，街上基本没什么人戴口罩，他们认为戴着口罩和别人讲话很不礼貌——只有病人才戴口罩。
At first, few people on the streets wore masks. They thought it was impolite to talk to people in masks - only patients wore masks.
而且伊朗人觉得，这次的病毒和普通流感没有区别，得病的都是老年人，如果真得病了去清真寺拜拜就好了。
And the Iranians feel that this time the virus is no different from the common flu. It is the elderly who get sick. If only they were sick and go to the mosque to pay homage.
过去这段时间，很多伊朗人还在坚持每周五去清真寺做礼拜。
In the past, many Iranians have insisted on going to mosques every Friday to worship.
直到3月6日，伊朗卫生部才宣布，取消当周全国范围内的礼拜活动，近6万处清真寺关闭。
It was not until 6 March that the Iranian Ministry of Health announced that nearly 60,000 mosques had been closed as a result of the cancellation of nationwide worship during the week.
这是伊斯兰共和国成立41年来，宗教活动第一次因为疫情灾害而被迫停止。
For the first time in the 41 years since the Islamic Republic was founded, religious activities were halted by the epidemic.
另外还有一个原因，伊朗国内贫富差距特别大。
Another reason is that Iran has a particularly wide gap between rich and poor.
德黑兰是靠山而建，据当地人所说，我所居住的北部是传说中的富人区，南部则相对穷一些，穷人们连温饱都没解决，每天最多就吃个馕，喝点茶，他们是买不起口罩的，也没有这个意识。
Teheran is built on mountains. According to local people, I live in the north of the fabled wealthy area, while the south is relatively poor. The poor do not even have enough to eat and eat, drink tea and not be able to afford masks.
上个月初，我从伊朗南部的海边城市阿巴斯港坐飞机回德黑兰，在机场看到有些伊朗人戴了口罩。
Earlier last month, I flew back to Tehran from the seaside city of Bandar Abbas in southern Iran and saw some Iranians wearing masks at the airport.
他们看见中国人或者亚洲面孔——在伊朗基本都是中国人——会躲开，或者会不耐烦地说一句“corona”（coronavirus）。
They see Chinese or Asian faces - mostly Chinese in Iran - avoiding, or saying impatiently, a "corona."
登机以后，我边往里面走边找位置，没戴口罩的人看到我经过时会捂住嘴巴。
After boarding the plane, I walked inside looking for a seat. People without masks saw me passing by and covered their mouths.
后来有一天晚上，我和当地的华人朋友去德黑兰一家很有名的餐厅吃饭。
Then one night, my local Chinese friends and I went to a famous restaurant in Tehran for dinner.
打车的时候，司机就开玩笑说，你们是不是有这个病毒？我们笑笑，并解释说没有。
When we took a taxi, the driver joked, "Do you have the virus? We laughed and explained that we didn't."
到了餐厅门口，服务员又问，你们是不是中国人，我们说是，他就说不好意思，中国人不能进去。
When we got to the restaurant door, the waiter asked if you were Chinese. When we said yes, he said, 'I'm sorry, Chinese people can't go in.
当时我觉得很尴尬。
I felt awkward at the time.
其实伊朗人对中国人还是挺友好的，但是也不排除极个别有些人会说，你是中国人，你有病毒，你不能进来。
In fact, Iranians are still very friendly to the Chinese people, but do not rule out a few people will say, you are Chinese, you have a virus, you can not come in.
。
.
2月27日，德黑兰一家银行里，很多人都没有戴口罩。
On February 27, many people at a bank in Tehran were not wearing masks.
一家大型超市被抢购一空。
A large supermarket was snapped up.
孙建龙家窗外，可以看到对面的小商店还在正常营业。
Sun Jianlong family window, you can see the small shop opposite is still in normal business.
德黑兰街头商铺密集2我是95后，毕业于绍兴一所大学的金融专业，在一家证券公司待了一段时间，之后就进了现在这家外贸公司。
After I graduated from Shaoxing University, I majored in finance and stayed for a period of time with a securities firm. Then I entered the present foreign trade company.
2018年，公司想在伊朗发展业务，当时我刚入职半年，便被派驻到德黑兰。
In 2018, the company wanted to develop business in Iran, when I was posted to Tehran after only six months in office.
伊朗在中东地区相对还是比较安全、对华人也比较友善的一个国家，所以我也没有太担心。
Iran is still relatively safe and friendly to the Chinese in the Middle East, so I am not too worried either.
下飞机以后，我从机场打车去住处，高速路两侧都是荒漠，感觉好像来到了“大西北”一样。
When I got off the plane, I took a taxi from the airport to my apartment. It was desert on both sides of the highway and I felt like I was in northwest China.
其实德黑兰还是比较现代化的，1979年以前也比较西化。
In fact, Tehran is still relatively modern, before 1979 also more Westernized.
城市有1300多万人口，人员流动量也大，人们搭地铁、公交上下班，郊区也通地铁，地铁是中国造的。
With a population of more than 13 million and a high turnover, people commute by subway and public transportation, suburban areas are also connected to the subway, which is made in China.
刚来的时候，我吃得不习惯，不过后来也适应了。
I wasn't used to eating when I first came, but I got used to it later.
德黑兰有四五家中餐厅，其中一家从老板到厨师都是中国人，在当地很出名，我以前经常去。
There are four or five Chinese restaurants in Teheran. One of them is Chinese, from the boss to the cook.
2月9日开始，这家餐厅就暂停营业了。
The restaurant has been closed since February 9th.
其他一些餐厅，进门处会给你测体温，给你戴口罩和手套。
In other restaurants, your temperature will be taken at the entrance, and you will be given a mask and gloves.
商场里面也是这样子，虽然现在人比以前少了很多，但还是开着的。
It was the same in the mall, which was still open even though it was much smaller than before.
包括一些中国人在这里开工厂，他们想停掉，但是客户说不行，你停掉我怎么办？毕竟国情不同，叫他们停业停产，或者封村、封社区，我觉得是不可能的。
After all, the situation is different, and I think it is impossible to shut them down or to close down villages and communities.
最先出现疫情的库姆是一座圣城，世界各地的什叶派穆斯林都会来库姆朝拜，人流量很大，很难实施封城。
Qom, where the outbreak began, is a holy city where Shia Muslims from all over the world visit Qom in large numbers, making it difficult to close the city.
而且伊朗经济本来就差，关掉之后相当于雪上加霜。
And the Iranian economy, already poor, would be worse off if it were shut down.
伊朗人总觉得中国人吃东西不干净，他们有时候会看CCTV-4，说中国人在田野里摘个东西就吃了，也不洗，很可怕。
The Iranians always feel that the Chinese do not eat cleanly. They sometimes watch CCTV-4 and say that the Chinese eat something in the fields and do not wash it.
有些人还问我，是不是吃猫、狗、蝙蝠这些，我就很生气。
Some people ask me if I eat cats, dogs, bats, and that makes me angry.
他们认为中国人什么都吃。
They think the Chinese eat everything.
一开始我还会解释，这只是小部分中国人的习惯。
At first I will explain that this is just a habit among a small number of Chinese.
后来我就懒得解释了。
Then I was too lazy to explain.
前几天还有伊朗朋友在Instagram上面发消息给我，开玩笑说你是不是吃蝙蝠了？我这个人性格比较外向，交了很多伊朗朋友。
The other day an Iranian friend sent me a message on Instagram joking about whether you ate bats? I am an outgoing person who has made a lot of Iranian friends.
他们大多都比我年长，三四十岁的居多，起初都是因为工作原因认识的，后面慢慢发现很聊得来，就变成了朋友。
Most of them were older than me, most of them in their 30s and 40s, first because they knew each other for work reasons.
这段时间，他们一直还在正常出门上班，防护措施做得比较好，戴口罩和手套，晚上也不出去聚餐了，就待在家里。
During this time, they have been going out to work normally, doing better protective measures, wearing masks and gloves, and not eating out at night, just stay at home.
没有发生疫情的时候，我晚上经常会被邀请去他们家里做客。
When there was no outbreak, I was often invited to their homes at night.
伊朗人家里都打扫得很干净，也很漂亮，家家铺地毯，一进门就要脱鞋。
The Iranians clean their homes and make them beautiful, carpeting their homes and taking off their shoes when they come in.
晚上九十点钟才吃晚饭，之后会喝茶聊聊天，差不多到12点钟我就回家了。
I didn't have dinner until nine in the evening, then had tea and a chat, and I went home about twelve o'clock.
时不时要夸奖他们做的饭很好吃，长得很漂亮。
From time to time praise them for the delicious and beautiful meals they cook.
或许是因为伊朗一直被制裁，人们已经习惯了，都比较乐观。
Perhaps because Iran has been under sanctions, people are used to it and are optimistic.
如果生了小病，他们也不去医院，往往是状况比较糟糕了才去医院，所以造成死亡率特别高。
In the event of a minor illness, they do not go to the hospital, often in a worse condition, resulting in a particularly high mortality rate.
还有些人觉得生不生病是真主的安排，自己不担心。
Others feel that it is God's plan to live or not to be ill and do not worry about themselves.
现在伊朗卫生部抓得也比较严，从3月2日开始，派出了30万个小组去每户人家排查。
Iran's health ministry is also cracking down, dispatching 300,000 teams to check every home since March 2.
德黑兰街上的人和车都越来越少，比往常少了一半左右。
There are fewer people and fewer cars on Tehran's streets, about half as many as usual.
前几天，一位伊朗朋友在德黑兰南部大巴扎拍了两张照片发给我。
The other day, an Iranian friend took two pictures and sent them to me in Grand Baza, south of Tehran.
当时是早上十点钟，以往这个时间，这里都是人，现在很多店铺都关门了。
It was ten o'clock in the morning, and at this time of the year it was full of people, and now many shops were closed.
伊朗政府没有执行强制性隔离措施，因为防疫物资短缺。
The Iranian Government does not enforce mandatory isolation measures because of shortages of immunization supplies.
地铁上有小商贩手挑肩扛着三无产品口罩，还有一次性口罩。
There are small traders carrying three product-free masks and disposable masks on the subway.
我已经自我隔离第十六天了，平时都不出门，偶尔出门买菜，看到路上只有三分之一左右的人戴口罩，很多人还是跑来跑去的，真的挺担心他们。
I have been isolated for 16 days, usually do not go out, occasionally out to buy vegetables, see the road only about a third of people wearing masks, many people are still running around, really worried about them.
。

3月5日，德黑兰南部汽车站外。
5 March, outside the bus station south of Tehran.
3月5日，消毒人员在汽车站内集合。
On March 5, the disinfectors gathered at the bus stop.
3月5日早上，消毒人员来到德黑兰南部汽车站。
On the morning of March 5, disinfectors arrived at the bus station south of Tehran.
3月3日上午十点，德黑兰南部大巴扎。
3 March, 10 a.m., Grand Baza, southern Tehran.
德黑兰地铁，中国建造3从去年底到今年初，伊朗发生了好几件事情，老百姓对政府怨气很大。
Tehran Metro, China Built 3 From the end of last year until the beginning of this year, several things happened in Iran, people are very angry with the government.
先是油价上涨引发了大规模抗议，那时候网络通讯不畅，真是叫天天不应，叫地地不灵，我只能通过国际电话或者短信跟国内联系，差不多十天以后才恢复正常。
First, the rise in oil prices triggered a large-scale protest, when the network communication is not good, really call every day, I can only call home via international telephone or text messages, almost 10 days before the resumption of normal.
接着，伊朗伊斯兰革命卫队高级将领苏莱曼尼在伊拉克遭空袭丧生。
Iran's top Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps general Suleimani was then killed in an air strike in Iraq.
死讯传回伊朗国内时，人们都很震惊，一下子产生了一种凝聚力。
When the news of death reached Iran, people were shocked, and a sense of cohesion suddenly developed.
但是5天以后，又发生了坠机的事情。
But five days later, there was another plane crash.
一开始伊朗军方不承认，后来消息公布，人们得知飞机是被自己的政府打下来的，颇受打击。
At first the Iranian military denied it, but it was later revealed that the plane had been hit hard by its own government.
后来中国爆发疫情，人们的注意力就转移了。
When an epidemic broke out in China, people's attention was diverted.
伊朗人一开始还在嘲笑我们，现在轮到他们自己，很多人也开始质疑政府，为什么不早点说呢？因为2月份伊朗还有两件大事：伊斯兰革命胜利41周年、伊朗第11届议会选举。
The Iranians laughed at us at first, and now it is their turn, and many are beginning to question the government, why not say so earlier, because there are two other events in Iran in February: the 41st anniversary of the triumph of the Islamic Revolution, and the 11th Iranian parliamentary election.
如果政府当时公开了疫情，恐怕就没有人愿意去街上庆祝或者投票了。
If the government had made the epidemic public, no one would have wanted to go to the streets to celebrate or vote.
现在选举结束了，政府才慢慢通报了一些数据。
Now that the election is over, the government is slowly reporting some data.
接下来这一个星期可能数字还会蹭蹭往上涨，很多是以前没有确诊的。
The next week may see some slippage in the numbers, many of which have not been confirmed before.
在和伊朗朋友交流的过程中，我能感觉到，他们虽然对政府有不满情绪，但是目前来说，很多人首先要填饱肚子。
In talking to Iranian friends, I can feel that they are dissatisfied with the government, but for now, many people have to fill their stomachs first.
伊朗这点做得好，穷人去买馕都有政府补贴，价格相对比较低。
Iran has done well in this regard, with government subsidies and relatively low prices for poor people going to buy naan.
如果不加芝麻，一块大馕可能折合人民币也就1-1.5元，够一个人吃一天。
If you do not add sesame, a large naan may be equivalent to one and a half yuan, enough for a person to eat a day.
他们一般会搭配煎鸡蛋、蔬菜、奶酪，好一点的会搭配烤鸡肉或羊排。
They usually go with fried eggs, vegetables, cheese, and better with roast chicken or lamb chops.
但是有钱人不单单是吃饱这么简单，他们很多人都移民去了加拿大、洛杉矶或者欧洲，不愿意留在伊朗。
But the rich are not simply fed. Many emigrate to Canada, Los Angeles or Europe, unwilling to stay in Iran.
在这里，所有的财富、权力都集中在少数人身上。
Here, all the wealth and power is concentrated on a few people.
来德黑兰将近3年，说实话我没觉得这里有什么变化。
I've been in Teheran for almost three years, and honestly I don't see any change here.
几年前是这样，过了几年还是这样。
That was the case a few years ago, and still a few years later.
这边效率真的太慢了，盖一栋高楼花个十几年时间都有可能。
It's really too slow here. It could take more than a decade to build a high-rise building.
请一名工人搬一批货，中国人用几小时，伊朗人要好几天，他们搬着搬着就跑去和别人喝茶聊天了。
One worker was asked to carry a load, the Chinese for a few hours, the Iranians for several days, and they moved and went off to have tea and chat.
经常有伊朗年轻人问我，能不能给他介绍一份工作。
Often young Iranians ask me if I can introduce him to a job.
伊朗不像中国第三产业这么兴旺，国家能提供的工作岗位不多，劳动力供过于求，失业率比较高。
Iran is not as prosperous as China's tertiary sector, with few jobs available, an oversupply of labor, and high unemployment.
年轻人即使一路读书上来，有文凭，工作也不好找。
Even when young people study all the way to school with diplomas, jobs are not easy to find.
他们的工作选择不太多，可能去政府单位和银行，或者去当交警，也有去看店铺的，去酒店、餐厅做服务员的。
They don't have many job options. They may go to government offices and banks, work as traffic police, visit shops, and work as waiters in hotels and restaurants.
但如果他会讲英语或者中文，去中国公司当个翻译，收入还是比较可观的，每月可能有1500美金，而据媒体报道，他们的月最低工资标准是92美元。
But if he speaks English or Chinese and works as an interpreter for a Chinese company, his income could be as high as $1,500 a month, compared with $92 a month, according to media reports.
伊朗有不少人会讲中文。
Many people in Iran speak Chinese.
前两天有一个伊朗网红，叫孟雅琪，用中文发了一段视频感谢中国医疗援助。
Two days ago, an Iranian netizen named Meng Yaqi sent a video in Chinese thanking China for its medical aid.
其实我认识的很多伊朗人中文比她还厉害。
Many of the Iranians I know speak Chinese better than she does.
学中文在伊朗是件挺时髦的事。
Learning Chinese is quite a fashion in Iran.
去年7月伊朗对中国免签之后，一些伊朗人就开始学习中文，准备从事导游行业。
Some Iranians began studying Chinese as part of a tour guide industry after Iran dropped its visa ban on China last July.
普通上班族一个月的收入折合人民币也就千把块钱，但是当导游一天可能会有一百美金，还很自由。
The average office worker earns thousands of yuan a month, but a tour guide can be as much as a hundred dollars a day and free.
2018年至今，我一直没有回国。
I have not returned home since 2018.
很多华人朋友在2月25号左右都回国了，我原本打算留下来。
Many Chinese friends returned home around February 25, and I had planned to stay.
回国肯定要待上好几个月才能再回来，我担心工作上的事情会落下太多。
It's going to be months before I come back, and I'm afraid there's too much work to do.
虽然也担心伊朗感染人数太多，局面失控，但目前我还是比较乐观。
I am optimistic for the time being, though I am also concerned about the number of people infected in Iran and the situation spirals out of control.
而且，如果过段时间疫情好转，我就有很多机会，没什么人跟我竞争。
And if things get better over time, I'll have plenty of opportunities, and very few people will compete with me.
不过最近公司通知我，一定要我回国。
But recently the company informed me that I must return home.
3月8日凌晨，我送朋友去德黑兰伊玛目国际机场，他要搭四点半的飞机从德黑兰回郑州。
In the early morning of March 8, I took my friend to Tehran's Imam International Airport. He had to take a four-thirty flight from Tehran to Zhengzhou.
因为防护用具全副武装，我们在车上没多讲话，但是彼此都祝福对方。
As the protective gear was heavily armed, we did not talk much in the car, but each blessed the other.
再过两天我也要回国了，有点依依不舍，希望疫情早日结束，恢复正常的经济和生活。
In two days I will also return to the country, a bit reluctantly, hope that the epidemic ended as soon as possible, normal economy and life.
