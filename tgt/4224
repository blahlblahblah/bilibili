深度和角度——这就是我们能做的。

但不论怎样，能从摩洛哥出来总归是好的。
But anyway, it's always good to get out of Morocco.
据我所知，现在仍有不少中国同胞滞留在摩洛哥，而该国戒严措施已经延长到4月了。
As far as I know, there are still many Chinese compatriots in Morocco, and the state of siege has been extended until April.
记　者 | 王仲昀受访者 | 君　酱今天（3月23日）上午，我从英国伦敦转机，终于回到日本东京。
Ryun sauce At last I returned to Tokyo, Japan, this morning (March 23) from London, England.
在经历数天的波折，以及近20小时的飞行后，我终于成功“逃离”摩洛哥。
After days of ups and downs and nearly 20 hours of flying, I managed to "escape" Morocco.
在东京机场入境时，我发现日本真的把形式主义发挥到极致。
When I entered Tokyo airport, I found that Japan was really putting formalism to good use.
过检疫区时，有申报表格的区域，但要不要填表申报，全靠个人自觉。
Quarantine area, there is a declaration of the area, but whether or not to fill in the declaration, it is entirely up to the individual.
如果来自疫情重点国，原则上离开机场后是不能乘坐公共交通或打车，需要自驾或亲朋来接。
If you come from an epidemic-prone country, you cannot, in principle, take public transport or a taxi after leaving the airport.
但事实是，一旦出关，就没人管你了。
But the truth is, once you get out of here, nobody cares.
但不论怎样，能从摩洛哥出来总归是好的。
But anyway, it's always good to get out of Morocco.
据我所知，现在仍有不少中国同胞滞留在摩洛哥，而该国戒严措施已经延长到4月了。
As far as I know, there are still many Chinese compatriots in Morocco, and the state of siege has been extended until April.
在东京入境时，经过检疫区为什么要去摩洛哥旅行？很多人都在问我，为什么赶在新冠肺炎疫情全球蔓延之时还出去旅行。
Why did I travel to Morocco through the quarantine zone when I entered Tokyo? Many people were asking me why I was traveling in time for the global outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia.
实际上，过程中我也有过犹豫。
In fact, I hesitated in the process.
这些年，我一直在日本留学。
I have been studying in Japan all these years.
我很早就计划今年３月毕业后前往摩洛哥游玩。
I plan to visit Morocco early after graduation in March this year.
当国内疫情暴发时，我曾有过取消出行计划的念头。
When the epidemic broke out in China, I had the idea of canceling my travel plans.
但又一想，摩洛哥是北非小国，最开始一直没有确诊病例。
On second thought, however, Morocco, a small country in North Africa, had not had a confirmed case in the first place.
就算是进入3月，全球疫情暴发时，摩洛哥的确诊病例仍是个位数。
Even into March, at the time of the global outbreak, confirmed cases in Morocco were still in the single digits.
通过摩洛哥本地媒体的报道，我们也了解到这些极少数的确诊病例全是境外输入性病例。
According to reports in the local Moroccan media, we are also aware that these very few confirmed cases are imported from abroad.
加上这是我期待已久的毕业旅行，于是，我和男友3月13日还是按计划从日本出发，在卡塔尔转机后，于当地时间14日到达摩洛哥。
Plus, it was my long-awaited graduation trip, so my boyfriend and I set out from Japan on March 13 and arrived in Morocco on March 14 after a stopover in Qatar.
这一路都非常顺畅，摩洛哥机场的入境检查也没有很严格。
The journey was very smooth and the entry controls at Moroccan airports were not very strict.
事实上，到达当天，我就看到新闻里说，摩洛哥停飞了包括中国、法国在内的14个国家的直飞航班。
In fact, on the day of my arrival, I saw news reports that Morocco had suspended direct flights to 14 countries, including China and France.
不过，这件事并未引起我们的重视。
However, this matter has not attracted our attention.
在当地租了车后，我们开始了自驾游。
After renting the car, we began to drive our own car.
在著名的“蓝色小城”舍夫沙万游玩时，我们真切感受到了这场旅行注定与疫情有关。
When we visited the famous "blue town" of Shevshavan, we really felt that the trip was bound to have something to do with the outbreak.
当时，有路人见到戴着口罩的我们，就一路跟着我们，不停朝我们喊“Corona”（新冠病毒）。
We were followed by passers-by who saw us wearing masks and kept shouting "Corona" at us.
3月15日，摩洛哥政府又发布了一份声明，表示为抑制疫情蔓延，该国决定从16日开始暂停所有国际航班，何时恢复另行通知。
On 15 March, the Government of Morocco issued a further statement indicating that, in order to contain the spread of the epidemic, it had decided to suspend all international flights from 16 March until further notice.
看到这份声明，我真的慌了，赶紧去看返程机票，发现返回日本的机票果然被取消。
Seeing this statement, I really panicked, hastened to see the return ticket, found that the return ticket to Japan was indeed cancelled.
3月16日一大早，迷茫的我拨通了中国驻摩洛哥大使馆的电话。
In the early morning of March 16, I dialed the Chinese Embassy in Morocco.
当时距离摩洛哥的“停飞”声明发布也没过太久，所以大使馆的工作人员表示他们正在寻求对策。
It was not long before Morocco's "no fly" announcement was issued, so embassy staff said they were looking for a solution.
大使馆的建议是，留在摩洛哥的大城市，保护好自己。
The Embassy's advice was to stay in Morocco's big cities and protect itself.
现在看来，这个建议是非常中肯的。
It now seems that this proposal is very pertinent.
一是能够在特殊时期保障自己的人身安全，二是后来才有可能去机场寻找离开的机会。
The first is to be able to safeguard their personal security during special periods, and the second is that it is later possible to seek departure opportunities at airports.
打完这通电话，我的这趟旅行也就提前结束了。
After this phone call, my trip came to an early end.
因为我在浏览当地的媒体时看到，除了所有国际航班停飞外，未来48小时可能还会“封城”。
As I browse the local media, I see that in addition to all international flights, the next 48 hours are likely to be "closed."
我和男友便立即开车回到了卡萨布兰卡。
My boyfriend and I immediately drove back to Casablanca.
事后证明，“封城”确实发生了。
It turned out that the "closure" had indeed taken place.
当地时间20日下午6点起，摩洛哥的民众除非有特殊需求可以凭借通行证出门，否则一律不得出门。
Since 6 p.m. local time, no Moroccan citizen is allowed to go out unless he or she has a special need to do so by virtue of a permit.
后来赶往机场时，酒店为我们办理的通行证焦虑的“滞留”自从3月18日回到卡萨布兰卡后，我们便被困在了这个国家。
As we made our way to the airport, the hotel's anxious laissez-passer stranded us in Casablanca since March 18.
我和男友始终处于神经高度紧绷的状态。
My boyfriend and I were always in a state of nervous tension.
一方面，摩洛哥的确诊病例虽然尚未大幅增加，但这些天各种军队车辆开进城市的大阵仗，营造出一种异常紧张的气氛。
On the one hand, although the number of confirmed cases in Morocco has not increased significantly, military vehicles of all kinds have entered the cities these days, creating an extremely tense atmosphere.
另一方面，相信来过摩洛哥的人都知道，这里的公共卫生状况普遍堪忧。
On the other hand, anyone who has been to Morocco knows that the public health situation there is generally worrying.
Play我们每天时刻关注社交媒体上相关动态，看看能不能找到离开的办法。
Every day we keep an eye on the dynamics of social media to see if we can find a way out.
很快，我们发现摩洛哥好像没有真正实现“全面停飞”。
Soon, we found that Morocco did not seem to have really achieved a "total ban."
国外社交媒体上，有人发布了机场的实时情况，显示机场还是有很多欧洲航班在起降。
On foreign social media, someone has released real-time information about airports, showing that there are still a lot of European flights taking off and landing.
因此，这些天不少滞留的欧洲旅客通过这些航班离开了摩洛哥。
As a result, a significant number of stranded European passengers left Morocco on these flights in recent days.
3月17日，往日热闹的菲斯古城变得非常安静我们全程留在酒店不敢外出。
On March 17, the old bustling old city of Fess became very quiet. We stayed at the hotel all the way.
随着酒店里的欧洲游客陆续离开，留下来的大多是中国人，或者亚洲面孔。
As European visitors to the hotel continue to leave, most of those who remain are Chinese or Asian.
3月20日下午，百般无奈的我在阳台上往下喊话。
March 20 afternoon, I am helpless in the balcony to shout down.
我用中文喊了句“你好”，结果得到了不少国人的回应。
I yelled "Hello" in Chinese and got a lot of Chinese responses.
有一位大哥跟我们隔空聊天，表示他出差来到这里，没想到回不去了。
A big brother and we chat every other day, said he came here on business, did not expect to go back.
在酒店阳台上认识的中国大哥我们中的很多人都保持着和中国驻摩洛哥大使馆的联系。
Many of us keep in touch with the Chinese Embassy in Morocco.
第二次通电话时，工作人员告诉我，他已经和摩洛哥政府交涉了一整晚，就是在商议包机的事情。
On the second call, the staff informed me that he had been negotiating with the Government of Morocco all night about the charter flight.
我们还关注了官方的微信号，并报备了个人信息，滞留人员彼此也组建了微信群。
We also watched for official microsignals and reported personal information, and those who stayed formed micro-groups with each other.
这些天关注世界疫情的人都知道，一般这是政府包机接人前的讯号之一。
As anyone who follows the world epidemic these days knows, this is usually one of the pre-arrival signals on government charters.
但是，特殊时期这种不安的情绪让很多人一听到动静，就恨不得马上行动。
But the uneasiness of a particular period of time makes many people want to act as soon as they hear something.
群里有些旅行团等不及，想要自行联系包机离开。
Some of the group couldn't wait to contact the chartered plane to leave.
3月21日，我看到有人发消息称，28日会有一班从卡塔尔转机然后到香港的航班，想要搭乘的话得先付2000元定金。
On 21 March, I saw news that there would be a flight from Qatar to Hong Kong on the 28th, for which a deposit of 2,000 yuan would be required.
虽然还有整整一周时间，仍有不少人付了定金。
Despite the fact that there is still a full week to go, many people still pay the down payment.
由于我已经在日本找到了工作，着急赶回东京就职，我和男友没办法一直等下去。
Since I had found a job in Japan and was in a hurry to get back to Tokyo, my boyfriend and I couldn't wait any longer.
同一天，我在社交媒体上刷到马拉喀什机场还有飞往法国的航班，我们抱着碰碰运气的想法赶往了机场。
On the same day, I brushed on social media to Marrakech airport and a flight to France, and we took a chance and rushed to the airport.
倒数第二个航班我和男友开了3小时车，从卡萨布兰卡赶到马拉喀什机场。
The next to last flight My boyfriend and I drove three hours from Casablanca to Marrakech Airport.
机场寥寥数人，几乎处于关闭状态。
The airport was almost closed to a few people.
飞法国航班的确有，但工作人员表示只能让法国人登机。
Flights to France do exist, but officials say they can only let the French board.
还没来得及叹气，我们看见对面英国航空公司的柜台也还有人，便立马冲过去。
Before we could sigh, we saw that the counter of British Airways was still occupied, and rushed to it.
这时，一位自称是美国大使馆的工作人员出现在我们面前。
At this point, a staff member claiming to be from the United States Embassy appeared before us.
他询问我们是否需要帮助。
He asked if we needed help.
我们告诉他，我们是中国人，没有美签，但居住在日本，是要回日本工作，并主动出示了中国护照和日本居住证。
We told him that we were Chinese, had no American visa, but lived in Japan to return to Japan to work, and voluntarily presented their Chinese passports and Japanese residence permits.
该工作人员随即表示，这趟英美包机航班先去伦敦，飞机上还有空位，可以带我们离开。
The staff member immediately said the British and American charter flight to London first, there are still vacant seats on the plane, can take us away.
至于之后去哪里他们不管。
They don't care where they go afterwards.
另外，这趟航班对我们是免费的。
Besides, this flight is free for us.
事情终于出现了转机。
Things have finally taken a turn.
当我们到登机口等待时，仍是惴惴不安。
We were still apprehensive as we waited at the gate.
因为工作人员告诉我们，还是得等等，等到他们确定没有本国公民后，我们才可以上飞机。
Because the staff told us we had to wait until they were sure there were no citizens before we could get on the plane.
直到真正登上飞机的那一刻，我才长舒了一口气。
It was not until the moment I actually got on the plane that I heaved a sigh of relief.
据工作人员说，3月21日是摩洛哥延长领空开放的最后一天，而我们这趟航班，是整个机场当天倒数第二个航班。
According to staff, 21 March was the last day Morocco extended its airspace, and our flight was the second to last in the day.
就在我们登机前一刻，摩洛哥又发布了封锁升级的通知。
Just before we boarded the plane, Morocco issued another notice of escalation of the blockade.
“逃离”摩洛哥时的机场3小时后，我们到达了伦敦希思罗机场。
Three hours after "fleeing" from the airport in Morocco, we arrived at Heathrow Airport.
预想中因为没有过境签可能出现的麻烦也没有遇到，就这样我们通过特殊通道成功入境。
Anticipated because of the lack of border crossings may not have encountered problems, so we have a special channel to successfully enter the country.
机场也是空空荡荡，几乎没有人。
The airport was also empty, almost empty.
我和男友立即买了飞回日本的机票。
My boyfriend and I immediately bought tickets to fly back to Japan.
在机场稍作休息之后，我们又登上了伦敦飞往东京的航班。
After a short rest at the airport, we boarded a flight from London to Tokyo.
一趟毕业旅行，最后变得惊心动魄。
A graduation trip turned out to be a thrilling experience.
