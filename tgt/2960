新冠疫情让处于美国制裁中的伊朗经济雪上加霜，也给本已激化的社会对立火上浇油，对于伊朗政权而言，眼下可能是伊斯兰革命40年来最危险的时刻李斯洋| 文马克|编辑伊朗的新冠肺炎疫情正在“爆发式”蔓延。
The new crown has worsened Iran's economy under US sanctions and fuelled an already simmering social divide. For the Iranian regime, this could be the most dangerous time in 40 years for the Islamic Revolution. & # 160; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45
2月19日，伊朗报告了首两例新冠肺炎确诊病例，两名确诊患者于当天离世。
On 19 February, Iran reported the first two confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia, and two confirmed patients died the same day.
截至 3月5日，伊朗官方公布的累计确诊病例已达2922例，其中死亡92例，死亡率约3.14%。
As at 5 March, the cumulative number of officially confirmed cases in Iran had reached 2,922, including 92 deaths and a mortality rate of approximately 3.14 per cent.
湖北在差不多同一阶段的死亡率是3.24%（2月1日）。
The mortality rate in Hubei was 3.24% at about the same time (Feb. 1).
伊朗政府和民众的反应却“慢半拍”，人们继续着往日的生活节奏，同时伊朗医疗资源不足、官媒缺乏引导，这让旅居在伊朗的中国人纷纷踏上“逃离德黑兰”之路。
The Iranian government and people reacted "slowly," continuing the old pace of life, while Iran's inadequate medical resources and lack of guidance from the official media set the Chinese diaspora on the road to "running away from Tehran."
疫情不仅波及伊朗民众，也在政府系统中肆虐。
The epidemic is affecting not only the Iranian population, but also the system of government.
截至3月3日，伊朗议会290名议员中至少有23名已确诊感染，比例高达8%，伊朗议会已经无限期休会，议员们也被要求不得和公众会面。
As at 3 March, at least 23 of the 290 members of the Iranian Parliament, representing a high percentage of 8 per cent, had been diagnosed with infection, the Majlis had been adjourned indefinitely and parliamentarians had been asked not to meet with the public.
此外，伊朗卫生部副部长、副总统、工业部部长等多名高官也已确诊，最高领袖哈梅内伊的一名高级顾问因感染新冠肺炎死亡。
In addition, a number of senior officials, including the Vice-Minister of Health, the Vice-President and the Minister of Industry, have been confirmed, and a senior adviser to Supreme Leader Khamenei died of pneumonia.
人们担心，一旦伊朗疫情失控，整个中东的防控局势都将陷入危局。
It is feared that if the Iranian epidemic gets out of hand, the situation in the Middle East as a whole could be in jeopardy.
截至3月3日，已经有至少10个中东国家发现伊朗的输入病例，中国北京2月29日也发现2例来自伊朗什叶派圣城库姆的确诊病例，二人均为中国籍。
As of March 3, at least 10 Middle Eastern countries had detected Iranian imports, and Beijing on February 29 found two confirmed cases from the Iranian Shiite holy city of Qom, both of Chinese nationality.
面对日益严峻的形势，袖哈梅内伊3月3日要求军队协助卫生部抗击疫情。
Faced with the increasingly serious situation, sleeve Khamenei March 3 asked the army to assist the Ministry of Health to combat the epidemic.
据半岛电视台报道，伊朗政府正在考虑动员30万名士兵和志愿者。
The Iranian government is considering mobilizing 300,000 soldiers and volunteers, Al Jazeera reported.
当天，伊朗宣布暂时释放5.4万名囚犯，以防止新冠病毒进一步传播。
On the same day, Iran announced the provisional release of 54,000 prisoners to prevent the further spread of the new cap virus.
伊朗版“火神山”医院也在中部城市亚兹德动工兴建。
The Iranian version of the "Mount Fire" hospital is also under construction in the central city of Yazd.
对于伊朗政权而言，此次疫情将本已高涨的民众不满情绪进一步激化，在美国严厉制裁下困难重重的经济也因此雪上加霜，眼下可能是伊斯兰革命40年来最危险的时刻。
For the Iranian regime, the outbreak has fueled already-rising popular discontent, adding to the country's struggling economy under tough US sanctions, and could now be the most dangerous moment in the Islamic Revolution's 40-year history.
逃离德黑兰“我只想早点回到国内。
Escape Teheran "I just want to get home early.
”在德黑兰大学读研的中国留学生张艺豪告诉《财经》记者，想要逃离伊朗的外国人太多了，每天都把办理离境签证的房间挤得水泄不通。
Zhang Yichao, a Chinese student studying at Tehran University, told Caijing that there were too many foreigners wanting to flee the country and packed the rooms with exit visas every day.
考虑到伊朗的医疗条件，再加上官方和民众都没有引起足够重视，张艺豪觉得伊朗的疫情已在失控前夜。
Given the medical conditions in Iran, coupled with the official and public inattention, Zhang felt that the Iranian epidemic was getting out of hand.
“一想起武汉封城那几日‘一床难求’的场面，我就更坚定了回国的想法。
"When I think of the days when Wuhan closed the city, 'a bed difficult to find' scene, I am more determined to return to the country.
”每天，伊朗政府公布的新冠病例数都在大幅攀升，但很多生活在伊朗的人认为真实情况只会更糟。
Every day the number of new cases reported by the Iranian government climbs sharply, but many people living in Iran believe the situation will only get worse.
为了避免与人接触，张艺豪去办理离境签证时宁愿步行，沿途经过的甜食店、饭店和银行都和往常一模一样，菲尔多西广场依旧密密麻麻地挤着换汇人，没有任何人戴口罩。
To avoid human contact, Zhang preferred to walk to get a exit visa, passing desserts, restaurants and banks just as usual, and Phileas Square remained packed with money changers and no one wore masks.
在逃离德黑兰的外国人中，中国人对疫情的反应更为敏感，不仅民间自筹回国包机，中国驻伊朗大使馆也积极协调。
Amongst the foreigners fleeing Tehran, the Chinese have reacted more sensitively to the outbreak, not only by chartered flights, but also by the Chinese embassy in Iran.
3月4日下午，从德黑兰出发的146名中国公民在使馆协调下乘坐南航CZ3002航班落地兰州机场，旋即被送至兰州新区后备医院集中隔离观察。
On the afternoon of 4 March, 146 Chinese citizens travelling from Tehran landed at Lanzhou airport on Air China Flight CZ3002 under the coordination of the Embassy and were immediately sent to the Lanzhou New District Reserve Hospital for intensive quarantine observation.
在伊朗德黑兰旅居十年、现在旅行社工作的陈春（化名）没有选择离开，而是打算和家人搬到德黑兰郊区躲避风头。
Chen Chun (not his real name), who lives in Tehran for 10 years and works for a travel agency, instead of leaving, plans to move to the suburbs of Tehran with his family to escape the spotlight.
“现在市区已经成重灾区，郊区毕竟人口密度小，疫情要轻很多。
"Urban areas have become a major disaster area, after all, the suburbs are less densely populated, the epidemic much less.
我们屯好粮食，尽量不出门，还是能够抵挡一阵。
We can store up the grain and try not to go out, but we can still fend off a while.
”陈春告诉《财经》记者。
Chen Chun told Caijing.
“我的感受是中国人很恐慌，但伊朗人很悠哉。
"My feeling is that the Chinese are panicked, but the Iranians are leisurely.
”陈春不时向身边的伊朗人描述新冠肺炎多么可怕，叮嘱他们戴口罩、勤洗手、买消毒液，但他们觉得这是过度反应。
From time to time, Chen describes to Iranians how terrible the new crown pneumonia is, telling them to wear masks, wash their hands frequently and buy disinfectant, but they think it is an overreaction.
在电视上，伊朗官方也营造出一种疫情不是什么大问题的气氛，告诉民众要正常上班，平日做好常规防护即可。
On television, the Iranian authorities have created an atmosphere in which the epidemic is not a major problem, telling people to get to work normally and take regular precautions on weekdays.
甚至告诉民众没必要戴口罩。
People were even told not to wear masks.
只有医人员和患者才需要戴。
Only medical personnel and patients need to wear them.
因此即便是疫情最严重的库姆，戴口罩的人也屈指可数。
So even Qom, where the epidemic is most severe, has few people wearing masks.
近些天，德黑兰的地铁、大街、学校等公共区域开始有了洒水车消毒作业。
In recent days, Tehran's subway, streets, schools and other public areas began to have sprinkler disinfection operations.
但陈春认为，“公共区域消毒的作用远远比不上一个口罩。
But Chen Chun believes that "disinfection of public areas is far less effective than a mask."
”为了呼吁伊朗民间重视疫情，北京大学中文系博士陈彬彬志愿组建了一个防疫互助小组，通过制作波斯语宣传视频和翻译防疫资料，让伊朗民众意识到这个病传染性很强。
"To appeal to the Iranian people to pay attention to the epidemic, Chinese Department of Peking University doctor Chen Bingbin volunteered to form a group to help prevent the disease by producing Persian-language videos and translating epidemic prevention materials.
陈彬彬向《财经》记者介绍，互助小组里不仅有许多翻译志愿者，还有大使馆工作人员、伊朗学者和驻伊媒体的参与。
Chen told Caijing that the support group includes not only many translation volunteers, but also embassy staff, Iranian scholars and media in Iraq.
伊朗的风俗习惯也给疫情扩散埋下隐患。
Iran's customs have also laid the groundwork for the spread of the epidemic.
伊朗人家庭观念很重，家族成员过去常常同住一个屋檐下，现在彼此间也居住的很近，平日里走动频繁，每周末都有家庭聚会。
Iranian families, who used to live under the same roof, now live very close to each other, walk about frequently on weekdays and have family gatherings every weekend.
此外，伊朗是个政教合一的国家，人们周五会聚集到清真寺做礼拜，这些习俗都大大增加了病毒传播的风险。
Moreover, Iran is a secular state, where people congregate in mosques on Friday to worship, practices that greatly increase the risk of spreading the virus.
随着疫情升级，伊朗政府也逐渐加大了应对力度。
As the epidemic escalated, the Iranian government gradually stepped up its response.
社会与政治危机激化“疫情给伊朗的经济、社会和政局带来的冲击，已经到了自1979伊斯兰革命以来最危机的关口，其严重程度不亚于两伊战争。
The social and political crisis exacerbated "the economic, social, and political impact of the epidemic in Iran has reached its most critical point since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, no less severe than the Iran-Iraq war."
”中国社会科学院西亚北非研究所殷罡告诉《财经》记者。
Yin Gang, West Asia and North Africa Research Institute, CAS, told Caijing.
2018年5月自美国单方面退出伊核协议后，对伊朗实行前所未有的严厉制裁，重创了伊朗的经济，导致其2019年GDP下滑约9%。
In May 2018, following America's unilateral withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, severe and unprecedented sanctions were imposed on Iran, crippling its economy and causing its GDP to fall by about 9% in 2019.
新冠疫情的爆发进一步加剧了危机，殷罡预测，今年伊朗GDP下滑将超过20%。
The crisis was further exacerbated by the outbreak of the new crown, and Yengang predicted that Iran's GDP would decline by more than 20% this year.
美国制裁对伊朗的打击是全方面的，不仅掐断了伊朗对外贸易的美元结算通道，使伊朗的国际贸易基本瘫痪，本币大幅贬值，还使伊朗石油出口一度“清零”，造成财政收入大幅缩水。
The impact of US sanctions on Iran was all-encompassing, not only cutting off the dollar route to Iran's foreign trade, essentially paralyzing international trade, devaluing the country's currency, and "wiping out" Iranian oil exports for a while, reducing fiscal revenues significantly.
短短几年间，伊朗民众的生活水平明显倒退。
In just a few years, the standard of living of Iranians has deteriorated markedly.
对此陈春有着切身的体会，“物价飞涨是‘肉眼可见’的，今天一个标价1万里亚尔的东西明天就变成2万，一个月工资去一次超市就差不多没了。
Chen Chun has a personal experience of this, "soaring prices are 'visible to the naked eye', today a price of 10,000 rials will become 20, 000 tomorrow, wages a month to the supermarket almost gone.
”因为本币大幅贬值，伊朗人不得不去黑市购买外币保值，德黑兰著名地标菲尔多西广场就是一处外汇黑市聚集地。
Iranians have had to go to the black market to buy foreign currency because of the steep depreciation of their currency, a black market exchange rendezvous in Tehran's famous landmark, Fidesi Square.
“我身边的很多伊朗人，手里都不敢大量持有本国货币，但越是抢购外币，本国货币就越贬值，陷入了恶性循环。
"A lot of Iranians around me don't have the guts to hold a lot of money in their own currency, but the more I buy foreign currency, the less it is worth and it is caught in a vicious circle.
”陈春说。
"said Chen Chun.
即便疫情如此严重，伊朗人也不愿放弃手头的工作，因为根本不敢存钱。
Even if the epidemic is so severe, Iranians are reluctant to give up the job at hand because they dare not save money.
很多伊朗人过上了以日结工为生的日子，每天的收入只够满足当天的开销，一旦无法工作，很多人就会立刻食不果腹。
Many Iranians live by the end of the day, earn enough to cover their expenses for the day, and if they are unable to work, many will starve immediately.
2019年7月，伊朗对中国公民实行单方面免签入境政策，带动中国游客数量翻倍。
In July 2019, Iran imposed a unilateral visa-free entry policy on Chinese citizens, doubling the number of Chinese tourists.
很多中国人原本将伊朗列入春节长假的目的地，伊朗的酒旅餐饮业也希望借春节发力，但突如其来的新冠疫情让伊朗旅游业降至冰点。
Many Chinese had listed Iran as a destination for the Lunar New Year holiday, and Iran's wine and beverage industry was hoping to capitalize on the Lunar New Year, but the sudden outbreak of the new crown has frozen Iran's tourism industry.
疫情加重了伊朗本就激化的社会对立情绪。
The outbreak has exacerbated Iran's already-simmering social antagonism.
2月21日伊朗议会的选举结果印证了这一点。
This was confirmed by the election results of the Iranian Parliament on 21 February.
据伊朗内政部公布的数据，当政的改革派仅仅获得20个席位，保守派取得大胜，在总共290个议席中斩获221个席位，其中包括首都德黑兰的全部30个席位。
According to figures released by the Interior Ministry, the reformers in power won only 20 seats, while conservatives won by a wide margin, cutting 221 seats out of a total of 290, including all 30 in the capital Tehran.
此外，此次投票率仅为42.57%，创下1979年伊斯兰革命以来的最低水平，其首都德黑兰投票率更是低至25.4％。
Moreover, voter turnout was only 42.57 per cent, the lowest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and was as low as 25.4 per cent in Tehran, the capital.
“民众对伊朗改革派统治者和经济状况普遍不满，保守派借此迎合民众情绪取得大胜。
"There is widespread dissatisfaction with Iran's reformist rulers and economic conditions, with conservatives pandering to popular sentiment for a resounding victory."
”上海国际问题研究院西亚非洲研究中心副研究员金良祥告诉《财经》记者。
Jin Liangxiang, associate researcher at the Center for African Studies of the Shanghai Institute of International Studies, told Caijing.
当局控制疫情不力，更加激化了民众的不满情绪。
Poor control of the epidemic by the authorities has fuelled popular discontent.
很多民众认为政府瞒报了确诊人数，人民圣战者组织甚至散布谣言称病例已达6万。
Many believed that the Government had misrepresented the number of people diagnosed, and MKO had even spread rumours that 60,000 cases had been reported.
“伊朗政府或许没有瞒报，只是他们也没有途径拿到真实数据，但可以肯定，真实的病患数据比政府公布的多。
"The Iranian government may not be hiding anything, only they don't have access to real data, but it's certain that the real patient figures are higher than those published by the government."
”金良祥表示。
"said Mr Kim.
今年1月，受民众拥戴的苏莱曼尼被美国刺杀后，当局的“报复”反应平平，加之又“失手”击毁乌航客机造成176名伊朗人遇难，加剧了伊朗改革派当局和民众间的对立。
In January, after the popular assassination of Suleymaniyah by the US, the authorities "" retaliatory "response was mediocre, and the" mishap "in destroying the UAE airliner killed 176 Iranians, exacerbating the antagonism between Iran's reformist authorities and the population.
此次议会选举中，宪法监护委员会甚至否决了改革派的候选人名单。
In the parliamentary election, the Guardian Council even rejected the reformist list of candidates.
“对于普通民众来说，对现政府的信任度已跌落至谷底。
"For ordinary people, trust in the government has hit rock bottom.
对于高层来说，最高领袖哈梅内伊年事已高，而各方势力最近都非常活跃。
For senior leaders, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is old, and forces on all sides have been active lately.
”殷罡分析，哈梅内伊所要面对的不仅是疫情，而是伊斯兰革命40年来最严峻的时刻，动荡可能随时发生。
In Yin gang's analysis, Khamenei is not only facing an epidemic, but the most severe moment in the Islamic Revolution's 40-year history, with instability likely to occur at any time.
但殷罡表示，最高领袖哈梅内伊现在还具备动员国家资源应对疫情的能力，例如调动伊斯兰革命卫队在疫情最严重的库姆新建野战医院，说明当局对军队的控制力和动员能力还比较强。
But Yin Gang said Supreme Leader Khamenei now has the ability to mobilize state resources to deal with the epidemic, such as mobilizing the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps to build a new field hospital in Qom, where the epidemic is most severe.
殷罡同时认为，伊朗民众和高层都是清醒的，一旦伊朗发生政治动荡，并不意味着美国对伊朗的制裁会放松。
Yin Gang also believes that the Iranian people and high-level are sober, once the political turmoil in Iran, does not mean that the United States sanctions against Iran will relax.
对国际油价影响不大伊朗的疫情正在向整个中东蔓延，截至3月3日，中东至少10个国家已经出现由伊朗输入的确诊病例。
The Iranian epidemic, which has had little impact on international oil prices, is spreading throughout the Middle East, with at least 10 countries in the Middle East having confirmed cases imported by Iran as of March 3.
“如果伊朗的疫情失控，整个中东地区都会非常危险。
"If the Iranian epidemic gets out of hand, the whole Middle East will be in grave danger.
”金良祥表示，伊朗拥有8千万人口，又处在欧亚大陆交通线的十字路口，自古以来都是区域政治经济文化中心。
Mr Kim says Iran, with a population of 80 million, is at the crossroads of the Eurasian transport links and has been a regional centre of political economy and culture since ancient times.
伊朗在中东的位置和武汉在中国“九省通衢”类似。
The Iranian thoroughfare in the Middle East is similar to Wuhan, which has thoroughfare in China's nine provinces.
向西和伊拉克、叙利亚等国，向东和阿富汗、巴基斯坦等国，向北和阿塞拜疆、土库曼斯坦等国，向南和阿拉伯半岛都有着十分密切的人员往来。
There are very close contacts to the west and to countries such as Iraq and Syria, east and countries such as Afghanistan and Pakistan, north and countries such as Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan, and to the south and Arabian Peninsula.
因为美国制裁的原因，伊朗对外贸易只能取道第三国来完成，这样更加剧了伊朗人在国外的流动性。
As a result of US sanctions, Iran's foreign trade can only be done via third countries, thus increasing Iranian mobility abroad.
“迪拜是伊朗商人做生意的重要中转站，平时正常商务往来就很频繁，加上疫情逃离伊朗的中上层人士多选择迪拜暂避。
Dubai is an important transit point for Iranian businessmen doing business, with regular business as usual and the choice of Dubai by the middle and upper classes who fled the country.
”张艺豪表示，在整个中东，伊朗商人的中转站还有很多。
Mr Zhang says there are many stops for Iranian businessmen across the Middle East.
疫情最严重的库姆是什叶派圣城，来自世界各地的信众来往于库姆，也给疫情扩散带来巨大风险。
Qom, the worst affected city, is Shiite Al-Quds, and the movement of believers from around the world to Qom also poses a great risk of the spread of the epidemic.
2月29日北京发现两例自伊朗输入的确诊病例，均来自库姆。
Two confirmed cases from Iran were found in Beijing on 29 February, both from Qom.
伊朗疫情扩散的巨大风险引起了全世界的重视。
The great risk of the spread of the Iranian epidemic has attracted worldwide attention.
中国于2月29日派出专家组携部分援助物资赴伊朗协助当地的疫情防控工作，美国财政部27日也发布一项豁免许可，伊朗可通过伊朗中央银行进行人道主义货物的贸易。
On February 29, China sent a team of experts with some aid to Iran to help prevent and control the disease, and the US Treasury issued a waiver on February 27 for Iran to trade humanitarian goods through the Central Bank of Iran.
1979年之后，伊朗政教合一政权一贯奉行扩张性外交政策，在中东的动作频繁，不仅积极输出伊斯兰革命扩展什叶派势力，努力打造连接伊朗、伊拉克、叙利亚与黎巴嫩的“什叶派之弧”，也在宗教和贸易往来方面与自己扶持的什叶派势力互动频繁。
Since 1979, Iran's secular regime has pursued an expansionist foreign policy, and has been active in the Middle East, not only exporting the Islamic revolution to expand Shia influence, but also working to forge a "Shia arc" linking Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon, and interacting frequently with the Shia forces it supports in their religious and trade dealings.
殷罡认为，目前伊朗在中东发力的三个方向中，伊拉克和叙利亚两个方向都处在收缩状态，仅也门“胡塞武装”方向处在进攻状态，但伊朗国力已经无法承担军费开支。
Yin gang believes that at present Iran in the Middle East power in the three directions, Iraq and Syria are in the contraction, only Yemen "Houthi" in the direction of the offensive, but Iran's national strength is no longer able to bear military expenditure.
“伊朗当局推行40年的对外意识形态和军事输出，已经走到了不得不调整的边缘，如果再不收缩，给周边国家制造的矛盾就会反噬自己。
"The Iranian authorities have come to the brink of having to adjust their foreign ideological and military exports for 40 years, and if they do not shrink, the contradictions created in neighbouring countries will eat into themselves."
”殷罡说。
"Yin gang said.
伊朗疫情向中东扩散对国际石油市场会产生怎样影响也是各方关注焦点。
The spread of the Iranian epidemic to the Middle East will affect the international oil market is also the focus of attention.
“来自伊朗本国的影响不大，因为在美国的制裁之下，伊朗的石油甚至一滴都出口不了。
"There is not much impact from Iran itself, because Iran cannot export a single drop of oil under US sanctions.
”中化集团经济技术研究中心首席研究员王能全告诉《财经》，中东的油田大都处在荒漠地区，人员很少，而且自动化水平很高，新冠疫情不会对这些国家的石油供应产生冲击。
Wang Nengquan, chief researcher at the centre of the group's economic and technological research, told Caijing that oil fields in the Middle East are mostly desert-based, understaffed and highly automated, and the new cap won't have an impact on oil supplies to those countries.
王能全认为，目前影响国际油价的依然是需求端的急剧萎缩。
Wang believes that the current impact of international oil prices is still a sharp contraction on the demand side.
“国际石油市场本就是个供过于求的市场，即便中东的石油供应受到影响，俄罗斯和美国的增产也能平衡供应。
"The international oil market is already oversupplied, and even if oil supplies from the Middle East are affected, increased production in Russia and the United States could balance supply."
”自疫情爆发以来，布伦特原油从1月20日65.98美元/桶跌至2月28日49.92美元/桶。
Brent crude fell from $65.98 per barrel on January 20 to $49.92 per barrel on February 28 since the outbreak began.
WIT原油从1月20日59.35美元/桶跌至2月28日45.27美元/桶，并创下11年来最大单周跌幅。
WIT crude fell from $59.35 per barrel on 20 January to $45.27 per barrel on 28 February, the largest weekly decline in 11 years.
2019年中国全年原油进口量超过5亿吨，对外依存度升至72%，石油消费量达6.9亿吨，占全球总消费量14.5%。
In 2019, China imported more than 500 million tons of crude oil, increasing its external dependence to 72 per cent and consuming 690 million tons of oil, accounting for 14.5 per cent of total global consumption.
新冠疫情已给中国这个世界第一大原油进口国和第二大石油消费国带来巨大冲击。
The new crown has hit China, the world's largest oil importer and the second-largest oil consumer.
随着疫情蔓延到日本、韩国等石油进口大国，对石世界油需求的打击面将进一步扩大，反映在油价上，就是自2月20日以来的连续暴跌。
As the epidemic spreads to large oil-importing countries such as Japan and South Korea, demand for oil in the Stone World will expand further, as reflected in oil prices, which have plummeted since February 20.
国际各大能源或咨询机构纷纷下调国际油价预期，国际能源署在2月出版的《石油市场报告》中认为，2020年全球石油消费仅增长82.5万桶/日，比年初的日增幅预测下调36.5万桶，是2011年以来最低的增长速度。
In its February report on the oil market, the IEA argues that global oil consumption will grow by only 825,000 barrels a day in 2020, the slowest pace since 2011, down 365,000 barrels a day from the start of the year.
国际知名能源咨询公司埃士信华迈（IHS）预测，今年一季度全球石油消费的同比增量将由此前预计的60万桶/日降为-50万桶/日，是2008年全球金融危机爆发后的第二次负增长。
IHS, an internationally renowned energy consultancy, predicts that year-on-year increases in global oil consumption will fall to -500,000 b / d in the first quarter from an earlier estimate of 600,000 b / d, the second negative growth since the global financial crisis erupted in 2008.
3月5日，布伦特原油跌0.28%，报50.98美元/桶；WTI原油跌0.24%，报46.67美元/桶。
On 5 March, Brent crude fell 0.28 per cent to $50.98 per barrel and WTI crude fell 0.24 per cent to $46.67 per barrel.
