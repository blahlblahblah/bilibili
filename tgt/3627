我不太确定学校停课的时间会不会继续延长。
I'm not sure if the school hours will continue to be extended.
因为我们在群里对此次意大利疫情的预测是不太乐观的。
Because our predictions about the Italian outbreak in the group are not very encouraging.
记　者 | 应　琛受访者 | 王艺林上午在宿舍自习完之后，我习惯性地打开新闻网站了解当天意大利新冠肺炎疫情的最新情况。
At the end of my morning study at the dorm, I habitually opened the news site to get an update on the outbreak of pneumonia in Italy that day.
我叫王艺林，目前在意大利北部城市特伦托学习生活。
My name is Wang Yilin. I am studying and living in Trento in northern Italy.
在国内读研的我，在去年9月作为交换生来到特伦托大学。
As a graduate student at home, I came to Trento University last September as an exchange student.
特伦托大学 图片来源于网络本打算在这里进行为期一年的学习交流，不承想新学期开学还没几天，学校就发通知宣布停课至4月3日。
University of Trento Pictures Network originally intended to conduct a year-long study exchange here, but a few days before the new semester began, the school issued a notice to suspend classes until April 3.
如果没有这次疫情的话，我可能也不会养成每天刷意大利各大主流媒体报道的习惯。
Had it not been for the outbreak, I might not have been in the habit of brushing the mainstream Italian media every day.
一番纠结之后，我决定留在意大利此次新冠肺炎疫情，意大利北部是重灾区。
After some confusion, I decided to stay in Italy this time the new crown pneumonia epidemic, northern Italy is a disaster area.
我所在的城市特伦托也在北部，隶属特伦蒂诺-上阿迪杰大区，并且就在疫情最严重的伦巴第大区东面。
My city, Trento, is also in the north, in the Trentino-Alto Adije region, and to the east of the Lombardy region, where the epidemic is most severe.
但因为城市本来就比较小，人口密度不高之外，这里也不是热门的旅游城市，人口流动本来也不是很多。
But because cities are already smaller and less densely populated, they are not popular tourist cities, and population movements are not high.
截至3月17日10时，整个特伦蒂诺-上阿迪杰大区的确诊人数为619人。
As at 1000 hours on 17 March, there were 619 confirmed cases in the entire Trentino-Haute Adije region.
虽然确诊人数每天都在攀升，但总体而言，这里没有出现过于混乱的情况。
Although the number of confirmed cases is increasing every day, overall, there has been no major disruption.
特伦托其实一直到3月初都是没有确诊病例的。
Trento had no confirmed cases until early March.
从国内疫情暴发到现在全球的蔓延，我的心情是经历了一定起伏的。
From the outbreak of domestic epidemic to the spread of the world now, my mood is experienced some ups and downs.
现在回头来看，我个人比较害怕的阶段主要有两个。
Now, looking back, I personally fear the two main stages.
第一个阶段是在国内刚开始暴发的时候，主要担心自己的父母。
The first stage is when the country starts to erupt, mainly worried about its parents.
因为人不在国内，很多中老年人一开始并不重视，就会比较担心他们出门不戴口罩，万一被感染之类的。
Because people are not at home, many middle-aged and elderly people do not pay attention at the beginning, will be more worried that they do not wear masks outside, in case of infection or something.
当时，我每天都会给家里联系，提醒父母要做好个人防护。
At the time, I called home every day to remind parents to protect themselves.
第二个阶段是在意大利确诊病例破千，并迅速增长的那几天。
The second phase is in Italy where the number of confirmed cases breaks through and grows rapidly over the days.
伦巴第大区和威尼托大区是此次意大利新冠肺炎疫情最为严重的地区意大利此次疫情应该是在2月21号开始暴发。
The regions of Lombardy and Veneto are the worst affected by the outbreak of pneumonia in Italy, which should begin on February 21.
当天伦巴第大区一个叫洛迪（Lodi）的镇上确诊了意大利“1号病人”，他是在境内传播的，并不是一个输入型病例。
That same day, Lodi, a town in the Lombardy region, diagnosed Italian "patient No. 1," who had spread within the country and was not an imported case.
当时，疫情严重的地方主要就是伦巴第大区的洛迪周边，还有就是我们大区东边的威尼托大区(Veneto)的帕多瓦（Padova）。
At the time, the epidemic was most acute around Lodi, in the Lombardy region, and Padova, in the Veneto region, to the east of our region.
我所在的当地留学生群内那时也还是比较平静的，因为对于新冠肺炎疫情的消息，说真的，还是中国人来得更灵通，不论是意大利主流媒体的报道，还是国内报道意大利疫情的新闻，都有人会发到群里。
My group of local students was also relatively calm at the time, because the news of the outbreak was, to be sure, better informed by the Chinese, whether it came from mainstream Italian media or from domestic coverage of the Italian epidemic.
我自己除了看一些意大利语报道外，还会上一个叫“奋斗在意大利”的网站，上面的消息来自于意大利主流媒体，是实时更新，并且翻译成中文的。
In addition to some Italian stories, I also had a website called "Struggle Italy," which was updated in real time and translated into Chinese from mainstream Italian media.
“奋斗在意大利”网站每天都会更新疫情数据但意大利整体疫情的发展速度超出想象地快，很快确诊病例就破千了。
Struggle Italia updates epidemiological data on a daily basis, but the overall epidemic in Italy is growing faster than expected, with thousands of cases quickly diagnosed.
而就在3月1日，特伦托也出现了第一个确诊病例。
On March 1, the first confirmed case appeared in Trento.
她是一个83岁的独居老奶奶，因此是不可能自己去过疫区的。
She was an 83-year-old old woman living alone, so she could not have been to the affected areas by herself.
换言之，是在我们大区内出现了传染现象。
In other words, it is in our region that contagion occurs.
不仅如此，她就是在离我宿舍不远的一个医院确诊的。
Not only that, she was diagnosed in a hospital not far from my dorm.
之后3月3日，跟她有密切接触的另外三个老人也确诊。
On 3 March, three other elderly persons in close contact with her were also diagnosed.
而第五个确诊病例则是她的弟弟。
The fifth confirmed case was her brother.
也是从那时起，我们这边每天的确诊人数开始有规律地增长。
Since then, the number of confirmed cases on our side has increased regularly.
3月初的那几天可以说是我最焦虑的一段时间，每天都能刷几十遍新闻网站，看看疫情的变化和政府新发布的政策。
The days at the beginning of March can be described as my most anxious days, with dozens of news sites brushed every day to see how the epidemic is changing and the government's new policies.
你会发现，一开始意大利方面还是实时更新数字的，但后来量实在太大了，就统一每天傍晚进行更新。
You'll notice that the Italian side was up to date in real time at first, but then the volume was just too big, so let's update it every evening.
从情感上来说，我肯定是想回到父母身边的。
Emotionally, I must have wanted to go back to my parents.
毕竟，这里的防疫措施和效果跟国内明显不一样。
After all, the preventive measures and effects here are markedly different from those in China.
但理智又告诉我，目前留在宿舍，尽量减少出门是最安全的。
But reason tells me that staying in the dormitory at the moment is the safest thing to do.
中间也经过多次反复，有时白天急切想回国，晚上又跟自己说不能回去。
In the middle of many times, sometimes anxious to return to the country during the day, and at night told themselves that they could not go back.
当时，我妈还跟我说，你要是实在害怕就回来吧。
At the time, my mother told me to come back if you were really scared.
在疫情发生之前，我每天都尽量和家里打电话，大多数情况也就是报个平安，有可能几分钟就挂了。
Before the outbreak, I tried to call home every day, and most of the time it was a safe call, maybe a few minutes away.
但是像现在因为停课待在宿舍，每天打电话时间几乎都要超过1小时。
But now, with classes suspended in the dorm, it takes more than an hour a day to make phone calls.
其实，也是让双方都安心。
In fact, it's reassuring to both sides.
后来经过和父母的讨论，大家都觉得留在意大利比较好。
After the discussion with their parents, everyone thought it would be better to stay in Italy.
一方面，回国路上有感染的风险；另一方面，现在国内入境政策每天都在变，也在逐渐收紧，即便下了飞机也可能根本回不了家。
On the one hand, there is a risk of infection on the way home; on the other hand, internal immigration policies are now changing daily and are gradually tightening, and may not be able to return home even after disembarkation.
因为我是上海外国语大学的研究生，所以也认识许多在其他国家读语言的校友，像葡萄牙、西班牙、法国和德国的都有。
Since I am a graduate student at Shanghai Foreign Languages University, I know many alumni who read languages in other countries, such as Portugal, Spain, France and Germany.
可以说，我们这段时间的联系明显要比以前频繁得多，大家除了互相安慰，也都是比较理性的，学校也都时刻关心着我们的情况。
It is fair to say that we were in much more frequent contact than before, that we were both reasonably comforted, and that the school was always interested in our situation.
说起来也挺荒诞的，我们无奈时偶尔互相比谁“数字涨得快”。
It is absurd to say that we have to compare each other occasionally when the "figures rise fast."
所以像意大利确诊数已经超过2万，我便成了很多同学的“精神支柱”。
Therefore, like Italy has more than 20, 000 diagnosis, I have become a lot of students "spiritual support."
而在意大利确诊人数还没有超过韩国之前，我在韩国留学的高中同学一直是我的“精神支柱”。
My high school classmates in South Korea were my "spiritual support" until the number of patients diagnosed in Italy surpassed that of South Korea.
事实上，开玩笑之余大家心里都期盼着疫情能尽快过去。
In fact, joking aside, everyone was hoping that the epidemic would soon be over.
措施发布及时，但效果不佳我所在的文学系在2月17日开学。
The measures were announced in good time, but the effect was poor. My department of literature opened on February 17.
但开学第一周，我选修的课程其实都还没有开课。
But in the first week of school, none of the courses I took had actually started.
2月22日，意大利疫情暴发的第二天，我们学校就第一次通知，停课三天。
On February 22, the day after the outbreak in Italy, our school was suspended for the first time for three days.
到了2月25日，学校又发了邮件说，停课到3月1日。
By February 25, the school had sent an e-mail saying it would suspend classes until March 1.
之后是3月4日，学校邮件说停课到4月3日，并开始上网课。
Then, on March 4, the school email said it would suspend classes until April 3 and begin classes online.
学校发来的通知停课的邮件　受访者供图这也是为什么我觉得意大利政府这一次行动其实算是比较快的，因为在疫情刚暴发没多久，基本上北部所有大区的学校都已经通知要停课了。
This is why I think the Italian government's action has been relatively quick because schools in almost all northern regions have been told to suspend classes soon after the outbreak.
另一方面，意大利在中国疫情暴发的时候就停止了与中国的双向直航。
Italy, on the other hand, stopped direct two-way flights with China at the time of the outbreak.
群里几个回国过年的同学还担心回不了意大利，立即转机飞回来的。
Several students in the group who returned home for the New Year also worried about Italy, immediately connecting flights back.
当然，其实本来往返意大利转机的情况也很多，毕竟机票能便宜很多。
Of course, in fact, the original connecting flight to Italy is also a lot of circumstances, after all, tickets can be much cheaper.
我同一宿舍区的一个同学是1月27日回到特伦托的，但在2月1日，她就接到当地警察局的电话，通知她必须到山上的统一隔离点进行隔离，费用是免费的。
A classmate of mine from the same dormitory returned to Trento on 27 January, but on 1 February, she received a telephone call from the local police station informing her that she had to go to a single quarantine point on the mountain at no cost.
虽然意大利这些政策出得挺快，但还是有漏洞的。
Italy's policies, though quick, have holes in them.
比方说，一开始意大利只检查和隔离中国人，对从中国回来的意大利人并没有采取措施。
Italy, for example, initially censored and isolated only the Chinese, but did nothing about Italians returning from China.
另外，听我那个同学说，虽然她去隔离了，但那边的隔离措施也不是很严格。
In addition, listen to my classmate said that although she went to quarantine, but the isolation measures there are not very strict.
我同学说，她看到隔离点里当地红十字会的工作人员并没有戴口罩。
My classmate said she saw the local Red Cross staff at the quarantine site wearing no face masks.
而且，意大利是从她入境的那天开始算14天，所以她其实在隔离点并没有待满14天。
Moreover, Italy was 14 days from the day she entered the country, so she had not actually spent 14 days at the quarantine site.
2月22日，意大利就已经封了伦巴第的十个市镇，即为“红色”区域。
On February 22, Italy already sealed off ten towns in Lombardy, known as the "red" zone.
3月8日，整个伦巴第大区和11个省市被纳入“红色”封锁区域，禁止出入。
On 8 March, the entire Lombardy region and 11 provinces and municipalities were placed under a "red" closure.
但就在当天，我们这边又出了一个新闻，称发现了一对从“红区”出来到我们这里滑雪的夫妇。
But on the same day, there was another story about a couple who came out of the "red zone" to ski with us.
所以也可以看出，意大利的封城措施并不严格。
So it can also be seen that Italy's closure measures are not strict.
3月8日在意大利伦巴第大区米兰中央火车站内拍摄的一名戴着口罩的女子　图｜新华社另外一方面，意大利的医疗水平是很好的，技术也十分先进。
Photo of a woman wearing a mask at Milan Central Railway Station in Lombardy, Italy, March 8, 2003On the other hand, Italy's health care is very good and technologically advanced.
像我们留学生都加入了意大利国家体系的医疗保险，每个人不仅会有家庭医生，平时在他那里看诊也都是免费的。
Like our international students, who are covered by the Italian national system, everyone not only has a family doctor, but also visits him free of charge.
在我看来，只能说意大利在面对传染规模如此之大的疫情时，医疗资源是不够的。
In my view, it can only be said that Italy's health resources are inadequate in the face of an epidemic of such magnitude.
没有足够的床位，没有足够的口罩，也没有足够的防护服等等。
There are not enough beds, not enough masks, not enough protective clothing, etc.
这也是为什么当地的口罩很快就被华人买空的原因，因为他们就没有储备的概念。
That's why local masks are so quickly bought by Chinese because they don't have the concept of stocks.
也想戴口罩，但真的买不到我的情况比较特殊，因为我平时会有一些过敏的情况，从国内来意大利的时候就带了两包一次性的医用口罩。
Also want to wear a mask, but really can not buy my situation is special, because I usually have some allergies, from home to Italy when brought two disposable medical masks.
所以，我是没有在这里抢购过口罩的。
So I haven't snapped up a mask here.
后来也不太出门，目前我还剩下20个左右。
I didn't go out much, and I have about 20 left so far.
但我身边有留学生朋友在钟南山院士宣布“人传人”的时候，就已经去囤了一点口罩。
But I have foreign students friend in Zhong Nan Shan academician announces "person-to-person", already went to hoard a bit of mask.
当时亚马逊上的价格还是10欧元50个一次性的医用口罩。
The price on Amazon back then was Euro10, 50 disposable medical masks.
但到了2月初，价格就已经涨到30欧元左右了。
By early February, however, the price had risen to around 30 euros.
我那时受朋友所托，特地花了一下午一路从宿舍走到市中心，打算去帮她买点口罩。
I was asked by my friends to walk all the afternoon from the dorm to the city center to buy some masks for her.
但去的五个药店全都卖光了。
But all five pharmacies we went to were sold out.
现在，我们这里就算愿意花大价钱也已经完全买不到口罩了。
Now, we can't buy masks at all, even if we're willing to pay a lot of money.
不过，买口罩的主要还是华人。
However, Chinese are the main buyers of face masks.
意大利人说实话，至少我接触的同学，他们的态度都比较无所谓。
To be honest with the Italians, at least the students I spoke to were relatively indifferent.
从宿舍望出去，仍有一些意大利学生围聚在一起　受访者供图虽然有很多人说意大利的反华情绪非常严重，但就我个人而言，并没有碰到过。
Looking out of the dormitory, there are still some Italian students huddled around the interviewees. Although many people say that anti-China sentiment in Italy is very serious, I personally have not come across it.
像我们宿舍是公用厨房，跟我共用一个厨房的意大利和其他国家的同学，都挺友好的。
Like our dorm is a communal kitchen, I share the kitchen with Italian and other students, are quite friendly.
在国内疫情严重的时候，他们还会关心我，问我家里的情况。
They will care about me and ask me about my family when the epidemic is severe in my country.
即便如此，我有同学因为戴口罩遭受过一些意大利人的不友善。
Even so, some of my classmates have been unfriendly to some Italians for wearing masks.
所以，说实话，我最早出门的时候并没有戴口罩，因为当地真的没有人戴。
So, to be honest, I didn't wear a mask when I first went out, because no one was wearing it.
在意大利人的观念里，生病的人才需要戴口罩，为的是不传染给别人。
In the Italian concept, a sick person needs to wear a mask in order not to infect others.
但即使这样，很多意大利人即便知道自己生病也不会戴口罩，说白了没有这样的习惯。
But even then, many Italians do not wear masks when they know they are ill, saying they have no such habit.
当然，当时我不戴口罩也是基于当地疫情并不严重。
Of course, I wasn't wearing a mask at the time because the local epidemic was not serious.
3月10日，在新冠疫情日益严重的情况下，意大利宣布“全国范围”的封锁。
On March 10, Italy declared a "nationwide" blockade in the face of a growing outbreak of the New Crown.
我因为担心之后会出现抢购的情况，所以我第二天一大早就去了当地的超市采购。
I went to the local supermarket early the next morning, fearing a panic buying spree.
我也是从这天开始出门都戴口罩的，安全第一，管不了那么多了。
I have been wearing a mask since that day, safety first, no matter how much.
意大利超市所幸当天并没有出现超市被抢购一空的情况。
Italian supermarkets were lucky not to have seen their stores snapped up that day.
但这也可能分地区，因为我查到新闻说，米兰其实很早就有超市被抢空的现象。
But it could also be a sub-region, because I've read the news that Milan have been short of supermarkets for a long time.
而早在封城的时候，更有一堆人涌入米兰火车站。
As early as the closure of the city, there was an influx of people into the Milan station.
他们之中有人是根本没有车票的，甘愿冒着逃票被高额罚款的风险也要离开。
Some of them had no tickets at all and were willing to risk high fines for avoiding them.
那天，卫生纸我也买到了，但最主要的还是吃的，比如蔬菜和肉之类的。
I got toilet paper that day, but the main thing I ate was vegetables and meat.
第三天，我和同学还特地去了中超（华人开的超市）囤了20包方便面，以及一些白菜和萝卜。
On the third day, my classmates and I went to Zhongultra (a Chinese supermarket) and hoarded 20 bags of instant noodles, as well as some cabbage and radish.
其实当天老板因为担心疫情已经自发关门不营业了。
In fact that day the boss because of fear of the outbreak of spontaneous closure closed.
他就住在超市楼上，我们是给他打了电话，请他通融一下让我们进去买点东西的。
He was upstairs in the supermarket, and we called him and asked him to be kind enough to let us in and get something.
这个时候也特别能体会到“同胞爱”。
This is also a special time to experience the "love of your fellow citizens."
但后来，意大利政府也出了规定，除一些必要的商店外，其他一律不能营业。
But then the Italian government made it a rule that all but some of the necessary shops would be closed.
随着疫情的发展，我也问过意大利同学，有没有想过戴口罩。
As the epidemic unfolded, I also asked my Italian classmate if I had thought about wearing a mask.
他们也挺无奈的，去药店买过，但根本买不到。
They also quite helpless, went to the drugstore to buy, but simply could not buy.
现在，有很大一部分意大利人已经认识到究竟应该怎样正确的隔离，会乖乖地待在家里不出门。
Now, a large number of Italians have learned how to isolate themselves properly and stay at home.
但难免也有一些“头比较铁”的，像我们宿舍区前些天还有一些学生，三三两两聚在草坪上晒太阳、野餐和聊天。
But inevitably there are also some "iron head", such as our dormitory area a few days ago some students, in twos and threes on the lawn to bask in the sun, picnic and chat.
3月12日，市中心仍然举办了集市我昨天（3月16日）早上又去了一次超市补货，就看到门口已经开始限流了。
On March 12, the city center still held a bazaar. Yesterday morning (March 16), I went to the supermarket to replenish the goods.
保安还会要求每个进店的人先用免洗洗手液消毒。
Security guards will also require everyone entering the store to disinfect them with a wash-free hand sanitizer.
超市门口开始限流　受访者供图店内所有的工作人员都已经戴上口罩。
The entrance to the supermarket began to restrict the flow of interviewees for all staff in the shop have put on masks.
顾客的话，我目及范围内有超过六成也戴着口罩。
More than 60% of my clients wear masks in my area.
工作人员戴着口罩　受访者供图超市里所有品类的商品还是比较全的，卫生纸、消毒液等都还有。
Staff wearing masks interviewees to map all types of supermarket products or relatively complete, toilet paper, disinfectant, and so on.
超市货架还算满　受访者供图学校停课后，我熟悉的意大利同学都已经回家了。
Supermarket shelves are still full of respondents for the school closed, my familiar Italian classmates have gone home.
接下来，我是打算尽可能两周内不出门了。
Next, I'm going to try not to go out for as long as two weeks.
因为基本上都待在宿舍，平时一些碎片化的时间都被整合了，其实很适合做一些集中的学习。
Because basically stay in the dormitory, some of the time of fragmentation has been integrated, in fact, very suitable to do some concentrated learning.
这周起，我也要开始上网课了。
Starting this week, I'm going to start taking classes online, too.
不上课的时间，准备写写毕业论文。
When not in class, prepare to write a graduation thesis.
目前，我不太确定学校停课的时间会不会继续延长。
At the moment, I'm not sure if the school hours will continue to be extended.
因为我们在群里对此次意大利疫情的预测是不太乐观的。
Because our predictions about the Italian outbreak in the group are not very encouraging.
第一，其他欧洲国家都没有像意大利这样迅速的应对，之后德、法、西等国家的数字会很快涨起来。
First, other European countries have not responded as quickly as Italy, after which the German, French, and Western numbers will soon rise.
第二，即便意大利这边控制好了，因为欧盟没有封禁措施，很有可能会出现输入型病例或者说确诊倒流。
Second, even if Italy is in control, because the EU does not have a ban, there is a good chance of imported cases, or confirmed reversals.
【记者了解到，欧委会主席冯德莱恩昨天（3月16日）在其社交媒体宣布，欧盟将进入禁止“非必要”的旅行者进入欧盟区域，以应对新冠疫情的发展。
European Commission President von der Lean announced yesterday (March 16) in his social media that the European Union would enter the European Union to ban "non-essential" travellers in response to the development of the new crown.
该禁令是暂时性的，有效期30天，如果需要还将延长。
The ban is temporary and is valid for 30 days and will be extended if necessary.
