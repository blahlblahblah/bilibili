李仪/华中科技大学新闻与信息传播学院2月15日，疯狂的电闪雷鸣后，武汉迎来了入冬以来的第一场雪。
Wuhan is facing its first snowfall since the onset of winter after a frenzied flash of lightning on Feb. 15, according to Li Yi / HUST School of Journalism and Information Dissemination.
这座疲惫的城市在大雪纷飞中更加静默，这样的武汉，有些陌生。
This tired city in the snow more silent, such as Wuhan, some strange.
仁珺靠在窗边看，不由想起了去年的初雪，下得更早、更烈。
Yan Zheng leaned against the window, not to remind of last year's early snow, under the earlier, stronger.
那是个没课的早晨，到处都是相约玩雪的朋友，把凉凉的雪天变成了欢闹的宴会。
It was a no-school morning, with snow-dating friends everywhere, turning the cool snowy day into a hilarious party.
她忍不住伸手接了一片雪花，好冷，只好缩回手。
She could not help but reach for a snowflake, so cold that she had to draw back her hand.
现在疫情这样严重，可千万不能感冒。
The epidemic is so serious that we must not catch a cold.
2月15日，仁珺从窗外看到的校园雪景。
On February 15, the benevolent Jun shows snow on the campus outside the window.
本文图均为 受访者供图作为新闻学院广播电视系的大三学生，她年后要开始大实习了，考虑到假期时间短，回老家云南临沧的机票又贵，仁珺咬咬牙，决定在武汉过年。
The picture shows the interviewee as a junior in the Department of Radio and Television of the Journalism School. She is going to start her big internship in the next few years. Considering the short vacation time, the airfare is expensive in Lincang, Yunnan Province, where it is decided to spend the New Year in Wuhan.
1月18日以来，仁珺就暂时住在华中科技大学的博士生公寓里，楼里多是寒假留校的学生。
Since January 18, the Yan Jun stays in the doctoral apartment of Zhongzhong University of Science and Technology, where most of the students are staying during winter vacations.
公寓内景图这是她第一次在外地过年，也是她第一次直面灾难。
Inside the Apartment This was her first New Year away and the first time she had to face a disaster.
一个普通人在灾难面前能做什么呢？仁珺的第一反应是想逃。
What can an ordinary person do in the face of a disaster? The first reaction of the benevolent Jun is to escape.
1月22日晚上，她订好了次日回云南的机票，收拾好行李，躺在床上，比任何时候都思念那个暖洋洋的小城。
On the evening of January 22, she booked a flight back to Yunnan the next day, packed up, and lay down in bed, more than ever thinking of the warm little town.
但凌晨的一纸封城公告堵住了她的回家路。
But an early morning announcement blocked her way home.
走不了了。
I can't go.
仁珺不愿意放弃，她23日一早退掉机票，抱着侥幸心理打开买票软件，竟真的抢到了一张早上8：40的高铁票。
The Jun did not want to give up, so she returned the ticket early on the morning and took a chance to get a ticket for the 8: 40 a.m. train.
为了赶着出门，她几乎是跑向行李箱的。
She almost ran to the trunk to get out of the house.
但一瞬间，她想到了高铁站人山人海的拥挤。
But for a moment, she thought of the crowded high-speed railway station.
万一自己携带有病毒呢？万一自己在途中感染了病毒呢？万一自己把病毒带回家了呢？仁珺拨通了爸爸的电话：“我不走了。
What if I have the virus? What if I get the virus on the way? What if I take it home with you? The Yan Jun dialed Dad's phone: "I'm not leaving.
”绝望坡不绝望说不害怕是假的，一向坚强的仁珺在电话里强忍眼泪。
Desperate slope does not despair to say that fear is false, but the adamant meridian is always strong enough to hold back tears.
留守江城，这绝不是一个能够轻易做出的决定。
Remaining in Jiangcheng is not an easy decision to make.
担心电话那头的父亲听出自己的异样，她努力稳住嗓音的颤抖，听着父亲一遍一遍地安慰、叮咛。
Fearing that the father at the other end of the line would recognize something different, she tried to hold back her voice and listen to her father's reassurance and exhortation.
现在她一个人待在疫区，必须要更加小心。
Now that she is alone in the affected area, she must be more careful.
抹了抹眼泪，仁珺立刻戴上口罩，全副武装前往校内绝望坡的药店采购。
Wipe the tear and the meridian Jun immediately puts on a mask and goes to the drugstore on campus where Desperate Poe is purchased.
公寓外专用于丢弃口罩的垃圾桶。
A dustbin for discarded masks outside the apartment.
从公寓出来往下走，就是绝望坡，再往下，就到了东九教学楼。
From the apartment down, it is Desperate Slope, and further down, to the East Kowloon Teaching Building.
长长的一段陡坡，是住在中西边学生上课的必经之路，很多学生踩单车爬坡，经常踩到半路就踩不动了，累得下来推车。
A long steep slope is the only way for students to attend classes in the west and the middle. Many students climb mountains on bicycles and are often unable to step on them halfway.
时间久了，大家便叫它绝望坡。
As time went on, they called it Despair Poe.
但仁珺顾不上累。
But the benevolent Jun is not tired.
医用酒精、洗手液、84消毒液、抗病毒口服液……她在心里一遍遍盘算，生怕遗漏什么，好在此时店内物资还算充足，很快便找齐了所需的物品，她却突然听见店员和进门的顾客在高声谈论什么。
Medical alcohol, hand sanitizer, 84 disinfectant, antiviral oral liquid... She thought over and over in her mind, afraid of missing anything. Fortunately, the store was fairly well stocked and quickly found everything she needed.
原来，两位住在华科校内的居民急匆匆赶来，想要多买一些口罩和各类药品。
It turned out that two residents living in Huako rushed to buy more masks and medicines.
仁珺在绝望坡药店内购置的部分药品。
Renmin Jun part of medicine purchased in Desperate Poe drugstore.
“能不能不囤货，多留一些口罩给后来的人？”“疫情再怎么严重也不能乱吃药啊！”仁珺听见那个穿白大褂戴着眼镜的大叔这样说。
"Can't stop stocking up and give more masks to the rest of the population?" "The disease is too serious to take medicine!" says Ren Jun, hearing the white coat wearing glasses.
即使这是营业的最后一天，他也没有放松自己作为医疗从业人员的要求。
Even though it was the last day of business, he did not relax his demands as a medical practitioner.
临走时，大叔叫住她，眼神瞄向门外的顾客，提醒道：“他没戴口罩，你离他远一些。
As he left, the uncle stopped her, looked at the customer outside the door and warned, "He's not wearing a mask. Stay away from him.
”仁珺心里暖暖的，这是她在封城后收获的第一份陌生的善意。
The temperature of the benevolent Jun was warm, the first strange kindness she had received after the closure.
她感受到一种奇异的力量。
She felt a strange power.
天气阴阴的，有些冷。
It was cloudy and chilly.
仁珺走出药店，加快了脚步。
The Jun Jun goes out of the drugstore and speeds up.
绝望坡后便是校内的居民区，上坡路上有各式各样的店铺，像是一条藏在校园里的小型集市街。
Behind the despairing slope were the school's residential areas, and on the ascent there were shops of all kinds, like a small bazaar street hidden in the schoolyard.
在一个水果摊前停下，买了些香蕉和橘子，仁珺顺口一问：“您这里什么时候关门啊？”老板娘挂在嘴边的笑容一下子僵住了。
Stop at a fruit stand and buy some bananas and oranges, but the Jun Jun asks, "What time do you close the door here?" The grin on the woman's lips froze.
“我们不停业的。
"We're not going out of business.
”仁珺从她灰蒙蒙的眼睛里读懂了，这是另一个被困在武汉的异乡人。
The Jun tells the truth in her gray eyes that another alien is trapped in Wuhan.
仁珺情不自禁地说了一句：“祝您新年快乐！”她看到老板娘的眼睛里有光闪了一下，也笑着回道：“新年快乐。
The Yan Jun cannot help but say, "Happy New Year to you!" She sees a light in the woman's eye and replies with a smile: Happy New Year.
”那一刻仁珺明白了，那股奇异的力量，来自灾难中的陌生人彼此慰藉的善意和共鸣。
The Jun understood at that moment that the strange power came from the kindness and sympathy of strangers in a disaster.
餐馆的小哥、便利店的大叔……破天荒地，性格并不算活泼的仁珺一路走，一路祝福，虽然只是短短的一句话，但她每说一遍，就多一分勇气。
Restaurant brother, convenience store uncle... For the first time, character is not a lively benevolent Jun go the way, blessing, although only a short word, but every time she said it, she had more courage.
“新年快乐。
Happy New Year.
”绝望坡并不绝望。
Despair Poe did not despair.
在室中起舞2月1日，继仁珺除夕夜吃泡面的“凄惨事件”之后，更惨的事情发生了。
Dance in the room February 1, after the "sad event" that the meridian Jun eats bubble noodles on New Year's Eve, something even worse happens.
博士生公寓宿舍区被封锁了。
The dormitory area of the Ph.D. student apartment was blocked.
从武汉到华科，再到公寓里那方堪堪七八平米的天地，仁珺的活动空间越来越小。
From Wuhan to Huaco, to the apartment where the range of 78 square meters is comparable, the action space of the benevolent Jun is getting smaller.
她知道，这是疫情越发严重的信号。
She knew it was a sign that the epidemic was getting worse.
仁珺忍不住拿出手机一遍遍刷新一线的消息，将感染者的症状一条条地与自己比对，“我会感染上吗？”她心里没底。
The Yan Jun cannot help but take out the message that the cell phone is refreshed over and over, comparing the symptoms of the infected person with those of the infected person, "Will I get infected?"
好在校方提供了舒心的食宿环境，没有让为疫情揪心的仁珺再为生活发愁。
Fortunately, the school provides a comfortable room and board environment, and does not worry about the disease with the heart-rending Jun.
仁珺所在的公寓共住了26名学生，大多数是本来就住这里的博士，每个人都领到了45个医用卫生口罩。
The Renmin Jun is in an apartment with 26 students, most of whom are original doctors, and each receives 45 medical masks.
学生们不能出门，一日三餐都由学校免费配送，每天早上八点到八点半，趁着孩子们下楼领早饭的空挡，宿舍管理员还会为他们量一次体温，以确保没有发热的迹象。
Students are not allowed to go out, three meals a day are distributed free of charge by the school. Every morning between 8: 30 a.m. and 8: 30, when the children come downstairs to claim their breakfast, the dorm warden takes their temperature once a day to make sure there is no sign of fever.
宿管为学生测量体温。
The dormitory takes the student's temperature.
非常时期，宿管的工作多了不少，不仅要像往常一样打扫卫生、按时巡楼，还要负担整栋大楼的消毒工作。
Unusual times, the work of the dormitory more than a lot, not only as usual cleaning, regular inspection of the building, but also bear the disinfection of the entire building.
同学们经常出入的一楼大厅，他们每天要消毒数次，电梯里贴着他们的工作记录表，完成消毒后要在上面签字。
Students often go to the ground floor hall, they have to disinfect several times a day, the elevator next to their work record table, after disinfection to sign on.
考虑到学生的生活物资消耗问题，学校决定由宿管统计清单，每十天集中采购一次。
Taking into account the consumption of students' living materials, the school decided to make a centralized purchase every 10 days by means of a statistical list of boarding houses.
张贴在公寓里的宿管消毒情况登记表。
Registration Form for the Disinfection of Boarding Places in Apartments.
“除了不能出门，在这里住着很好。
"It's good to live here, except that you can't go out.
”仁珺对现在的封锁生活还算满意。
The Jun is satisfied with the current closure.
她原定二月初前往北京实习，现在正在做线上的运营工作，虽然很忙，但总算为她单调的生活增添了一些色彩。
She was scheduled to go to Beijing for an internship in early February, and is now doing on-line operations that, though busy, have added some color to her monotonous life.
院系辅导员范老师每天都会通过微信询问她的情况；朋友们怕她无聊，赞助了各大视频网站的会员；和父亲每天的相互问候成为习惯……在这个小小的公寓里，她渐渐学会了在重复的日常中得趣。
Teacher Fei, a faculty counselor, asks about her every day by micromail; friends sponsor members of major video sites for fear of boredom; and daily greetings with her father become a habit... in this small apartment, she gradually learns to enjoy the routine of repetition.
担心女儿久坐缺乏运动，父亲常告诫她“多动一动”，从小爱好舞蹈的仁珺便动了在公寓练舞的心思。
Worried about her daughter's sedentary lack of exercise, her father often admonishes her "to move" and the dance-loving merino Jun turns to dancing in the apartment.
从前住四人间，空间小还会打扰到其他同学，仁珺只有趁宿舍没人的时候才能看视频学舞。
In the past, living in four rooms, the space is small enough to disturb the other students, and the Jun Jun is only allowed to watch video dancing while the dormitory is empty.
现在一个人住，正好可以练练舞，她会把练习的舞蹈录成视频发到朋友圈，等待父亲的走心评论：“对，就这样，加油！”大年三十，仁珺一个人在公寓里用笔记本电脑看春晚。
Now living alone, just enough to practice dancing, she will videotape the practice dance to a circle of friends, waiting for her father's thoughtless comment: "Yes, that's it, come on!" In the thirtieth year, Renmin Jun is alone in the apartment watching a spring festival with a laptop.
父亲是不善表达的。
Fathers are not good at expressing themselves.
他不会说那些露骨的思念，但每天一通电话从来不断，每次都要叮嘱她“做好防护”、“好好保护自己”、“好好休息”。
He would not say that he missed her openly, but he would never stop talking on the phone every day, telling her to "protect herself," "protect herself" and "take a good rest."
一日又一日，仁珺的焦虑和恐惧就在父亲笨拙的关心下消解了。
Day after day the anxiety and fear of the meridian Jun dispels with his father's clumsy concern.
仁珺留守江城已经一个多月了，尽管还是会因为各种关于疫情的报道揪心不已，但心态已经平稳了许多。
The Jun Jun stays in Jiangcheng for more than a month, although it is still gripped by reports of an epidemic, but the state of mind is much calmer.
一想到全国各地的物资和医务人员都在快马加鞭驰援湖北，她心里就有说不出来的澎湃和感动。
At the thought of the material and medical personnel all over the country in the rapid whip up Hubei, her heart can not say the roar and moved.
又到了下楼领饭的时间。
It's time to get down again.
仁珺戴上口罩，拉紧羽绒服的领口，出门便瞧见有学生喂食公寓附近的流浪猫。
The merino Jun wears a mask and pulls the neck of the down jacket so that the stray cat near the apartment is seen feeding by the students.
这猫不知疫情严重，只管每日大快朵颐，倒是比来的时候胖了一圈。
The cat, unaware of the severity of the outbreak, gobbled up food daily, but gained a circle from its arrival.
她不禁羡慕起这只猫的自在来。
She could not help envying the feline's ease.
疫情过后，你最想做什么呢？仁珺的心愿很简单：出去狠狠吃顿好吃的，然后赶快回家。
What do you most want to do after the outbreak? The goal is simple: go out and get a good meal, and then go home quickly.
