这些研究表明，野生动物源冠状病毒是一种“明确和当前的危险”，许多冠状病毒具有大流行的潜力，而当我们毫不顾忌地去直接或间接接触，可能就是下一次病毒大暴发的导火索。
These studies suggest that the coronavirus is a "clear and present danger," that many coronavirus has pandemic potential, and that when we do not hesitate to make direct or indirect contact, it could be the trigger for the next outbreak.
本文5867字，阅读全文约10分钟图/pixabay文 | 都保杰 转自| DeepTech深科技关于新冠病毒溯源，至今仍有许多疑问，比如它以何种方式从动物进入人体，以及未来是否还会卷土重来？虽然答案多是推测，但在一些研究蝙蝠的科学家看来，冠状病毒的暴发却并非偶然。
In this article 5867 words, read the full text for about 10 minutes. & # 160; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
在中国新冠疫情暴发初期，武汉病毒研究所石正丽团队曾将这种病毒与来自中国南部的中华菊头蝠病毒进行比对，发现在基因上具有 96.2％以上的同源性，且新冠病毒还是 17 年前 SARS 的远亲，两者有 79.5％的基因序列相同，这锁定了新型冠状病毒的自然宿主或仍是蝙蝠。
In the early days of the outbreak, the Wuhan virus research institute Shi Zhengli's team compared the virus to the Chinese chrysanthemum bat virus from southern China and found that it was genetically more than 96.2% homologous and that the new crown virus was a distant relative of SARS 17 years ago, with 79.5% of the same gene sequence, locking in the new coronavirus's natural host or still a bat.
自然界中病毒种类繁多，偶尔也会跨越种群，传播给人或者其他动物，这便是病毒学家们担忧的病毒“溢出( spillover )”，而溢出的方式有着各种可能，比如存在中间宿主，食用蝙蝠等野味，甚至可能源于中药。
Viruses are numerous in nature and occasionally spread across populations to humans or other animals. This is what virologists fear is a virus "spill" in a variety of ways, such as the presence of intermediate hosts, the consumption of game such as bats, and possibly even traditional Chinese medicine.
图｜关于冠状病毒与蝙蝠中药衍生品的联系探讨（来源：sfam）中药“夜明砂”就是蝙蝠科动物的粪便制作而成，用来治疗眼疾或解毒。
Research on the Coronavirus and Bat Chinese Medicine Derivatives: Research on the Relationship between Coronavirus and Bat Traditional Chinese Medicine Derivatives: Nightgrit, a traditional Chinese medicine made from the excrement of the bat family, is used to treat eye disease or detoxification.
日前，来自德国的一位分子微生物学和基因组学专家 Trudy M. Wassenaar 在研究中推测，蝙蝠物种作为冠状病毒的天然贮藏库，整个捕捉、处理、贩卖以及服用野生蝙蝠中药衍生品的链条可能为人畜共患病的传播提供了巨大潜在风险。
In a recent study, Trudy M. Wassenaar, a specialist in molecular microbiology and genomics from Germany, speculated that bat species, as a natural reservoir of coronavirus, could pose a significant potential risk for the spread of zoonotic disease by trapping, processing, selling and consuming the entire chain of wild bat herbal derivatives.
而非营利性研究组织 EcoHealth Alliance（生态健康联盟）的研究人员们研究发现，来自蝙蝠的冠状病毒“溢出”事件或已在中国悄然发生了多年，一些蝙蝠种群中与 SARS 相关的冠状病毒甚至不需要额外的突变步骤即可感染人类宿主。
Researchers for the non-profit Eco Health Alliance found that the coronavirus "overflow" from bats has been happening in China for years, and that the SARS-related coronavirus in some bat populations can infect human hosts without even requiring additional mutation steps.
该联盟主席、美国传染病学家 Peter Daszak 教授日前在 Biosafety and Health 撰文表示，在过去的 10 年里，联盟与中国科学家合作，在华南地区收集了超过 1 万只蝙蝠和大约 2 千种其他哺乳动物的样本，发现了 52 种新的 SARS 相关冠状病毒和大量其他冠状病毒。
Writing recently in Biosafety and Health, the alliance's chairman and US epidemiologist, Professor Peter Daszak, said over the past 10 years, the alliance has collected samples of more than 10,000 bats and about 2,000 other mammals in southern China, and found 52 new SARS-related coronavirus and a large number of other coronavirus.
这些研究表明，野生动物源冠状病毒是一种“明确和当前的危险”，许多冠状病毒具有大流行的潜力，而当我们毫不顾忌地去直接或间接接触，可能就是下一次病毒大暴发的导火索。
These studies suggest that the coronavirus is a "clear and present danger," that many coronavirus has pandemic potential, and that when we do not hesitate to make direct or indirect contact, it could be the trigger for the next outbreak.
图｜研究人员捕获一只蝙蝠进行采样（来源：生态健康联盟）01冠状病毒的引发途径可能更直接生态健康联盟和石正丽团队曾于 2013 年合作在 Nature 上发表了一项研究，研究人员从蝙蝠粪便样本中分离到一种活性的 SL-CoV。
+ yeg researchers have captured a bat for sampling (source: Ecological Health Alliance) 01-coronavirus may have been triggered more directly The Alliance for Ecological Health and the team of Shi Zhengli published a study in Nature in 2013 in which researchers isolated an active SL-CoV from bat fecal samples.
该病毒具有典型的冠状病毒形态，99.9% 的序列同源性为 Rs3367，并能通过 ACE2 受体细胞入侵人体，这证实某些 SARS 相关冠状病毒（SARSr-CoVs）可能具有感染人类细胞的高潜力，而无需中间宿主。
The virus has a typical coronavirus pattern, with 99.9% of the sequence homologous Rs 3367 and being able to invade the body through ACE2 receptor cells, confirming that some SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoVs) may have a high potential to infect human cells without the need for an intermediate host.
2018 年，双方又在《中国病毒学》杂志上发表了新的探索，再次对中国蝙蝠SARS相关冠状病毒感染的血清学证据进行调研。
In 2018, the two sides published a new study in the journal Virology of China, again investigating the serological evidence for the SARS-related coronavirus infection in Chinese bats.
在这项研究中，团队对住在蝙蝠洞穴附近的人们进行了血清学监测，样本包含 218 个居民，他们的生活区位于洞穴周边 1.1-6.0公里范围内。
In the study, the team carried out serological monitoring of people living near bat caves. The samples consisted of 218 residents living within 1.1-6.0 km of the cave perimeter.
样本中 81.2％的人饲养或拥有牲畜或宠物，97.2％曾有过接触牲畜或野生动物的历史。
Of the sample, 81.2 per cent had livestock or pets and 97.2 per cent had a history of contact with livestock or wildlife.
更重要的是，有 9.1％的人目睹了蝙蝠在房屋附近飞行。
More importantly, 9.1 per cent of the population witnessed bats flying close to their houses.
对于这些居住在蝙蝠群落附近的高危人群，检测结果是血清阳性率为 2.7％，这表明溢出是相对罕见的事件，也取决于抗体在人体内持续多长时间，在询问过程中，6 名血清反应阳性的受试者在过去的 12 个月中没有回想起任何临床症状。
For these high-risk populations living close to bat communities, the seroprevalence rate was 2.7 per cent, indicating that the spill was a relatively rare event and depended on how long the antibody lasts in the body. During the questioning, the six seropositive subjects did not recall any clinical symptoms in the past 12 months.
来自生态健康联盟的流行病学和社会科学专家李泓萤对 DeepTech 表示，病毒溢出发生在自然界，但它的传播研究仍需要几个因素来协调，包括：病原体暴露的生态、流行病学和行为决定因素，以及影响感染易感性的人类内部因素……如果我们知道一些风险，我们就可以预防。
Virus spills occur in nature, but its propagation needs to be coordinated by several factors, including the ecological, epidemiological and behavioural determinants of pathogen exposure and the internal human factors that influence susceptibility... If we know some risks, we can prevent them, "Li Hong, an epidemiologist and social science expert from the Ecological Health Alliance, told DeepTech.
过去十年，李泓萤团队对与蝙蝠栖息地有密切接触的居民进行生物和行为监测，在那里同样发现了冠状病毒感染和病毒溢出现象，虽然与当下的新冠病毒差异较大，而且阳性率偏低，但这些实验室结果已显示出了潜在的危险信号。
While the coronavirus infection and virus overflow have also been found in the past decade when the Li team conducts biological and behavioural monitoring of residents who are in close contact with the bat habitat, these laboratory results have shown potentially dangerous signals, although they are different from the current ones and have low positive rates.
而如果是直接接触蝙蝠或蝙蝠排泄物，风险可能更高。
In the case of direct contact with bat or bat faeces, the risk may be higher.
德国专家 Trudy M. Wassenaar 在研究中推测，新冠肺炎疫区武汉的食品市场可能已经或一直在出售蝙蝠作为食物，此外蝙蝠及其排泄物经常用于中药，活的或最近死亡的受感染蝙蝠物种因其药用价值而被贸易商处理。
A German expert, Trudy M. Wassenaar, speculated in his research that bats may have been or have been sold as food in Wuhan in the area affected by pneumonia, and that bats and their excreta are often used in Chinese medicine, and that living or recently deceased infected bat species are treated by traders for their medicinal value.
而在贸易链中，宿主的跳跃发生在受感染的蝙蝠和另一些哺乳动物之间，后者接下来可能成为感染源。
In the trade chain, the host jumps between infected bats and other mammals, which may then become a source of infection.
即使在中国完全禁止在食品市场上出售活的野生动物，以传统医学惯例进行的蝙蝠交易和处理仍将是未来人畜共患冠状病毒流行的严重风险。
Even with the complete ban on the sale of live wild animals on the food market in China, the trade and handling of bats in accordance with traditional medical practices will remain a serious risk for future outbreaks of coronavirus.
整体而言，引发冠病毒暴发的途径可能更直接，各类主动或被动式的“溢出”事件造成蝙蝠病毒进入人体，产生地域性或者药用领域感染病例，进而引发全球性的病毒大流行。
In general, the pathways leading to crown virus outbreaks may be more direct, with a variety of active and passive "spills" causing bat viruses to enter the human body, producing local or pharmaceutical infections that could trigger a global virus pandemic.
图｜研究人员对捕获的蝙蝠进行病毒采样以及探索蝙蝠藏身的山洞（来源：生态健康联盟）02高风险和弱意识大多数侵袭人类的新发传染病是人畜共患的，如艾滋病病毒、埃博拉病毒、SARS 以及 MERS 等等，都可以追溯到一些特定的野生动物，但是一直以来，很少有分析工具可以确定哪些宿主物种可能携带下一株席卷人类的病毒，或者哪些病毒可能会直接跨越物种边界。
Researchers have sampled captured bats and explored caves where bats are hiding (Source: Ecological Health Alliance) 02 High-risk and weakly conscious Most of the new infectious diseases afflicting humans can be traced back to specific wild animals, but few analytical tools have been found to determine which host species may carry the next virus sweeping across species boundaries.
2017 年，生态健康联盟的生态学家和进化生物学家 Kevin Olival团队对哺乳动物宿主与病毒的关系进行了全面分析，表明了感染某一物种的病毒总数和可能引起人畜共患病的比例其实是可以预测的，这项研究于 2017 年 6 月发表在权威期刊 Nature 上。
In 2017, Kevin Olival, an ecologist and evolutionary biologist at the Ecological Health Alliance, conducted a comprehensive analysis of mammalian hosts "relationship to the virus, showing that the total number of viruses infected with a species and the proportion likely to cause zoonoses are in fact predictable, published in the authoritative journal Nature in June 2017.
团队创建并分析了 2805 种哺乳动物病毒关联的数据库，包括来自 15 个目的 754 种哺乳动物物种（占全球哺乳动物多样性的 14%）和来自 28 个病毒科的 586 种独特病毒物种。
The team created and analysed a database of 2,805 mammalian virus associations, including 754 mammalian species from 15 species (14 per cent of global mammalian diversity) and 586 unique virus species from 28 virology families.
结果显示，与其他哺乳动物群体相比，蝙蝠、灵长类动物和啮齿动物具有更高的人畜共患病毒比例。
The results showed that bats, primates and rodents had higher rates of zoonoses than other mammalian populations.

研究也证明，野生蝙蝠（翼手目动物）携带的人畜共患病毒比例明显高于所有其他调研样本中的哺乳动物。
Studies have also shown that wild bats (pterodactyls) carry significantly higher rates of zoonotic virus than mammals in all other study samples.

近年来，新发传染病对全球健康、经济和安全构成日益突出和严重的威胁，它们的暴发频率和经济的影响都在上升，但我们对疾病出现的原因理解是不完整的，科学家只是观察到，几乎所有近年来的病毒大流行都起源于动物，主要是野生动物和家畜种群间的动态交互，以及在这样快速变化环境中的不太敏感的人们。
In recent years, emerging infectious diseases have become an increasingly prominent and serious threat to global health, the economy and security, and their frequency and economic impact are on the rise, but our understanding of the causes of the disease is incomplete. Scientists have only observed that almost all recent viral pandemics originate from the dynamic interactions between animals, mainly wildlife and livestock populations, and less sensitive people in such a rapidly changing environment.
在过去的 10 年里，生态健康联盟与中国科学家合作，在华南地区收集了超过 10000只蝙蝠和大约 2000种其他哺乳动物的样本，发现了 52 种新的 SARS 相关冠状病毒、122 种其他β-冠状病毒、350 多种新型 α-冠状病毒和一种新的“谱系 E ”β-冠状病毒进化枝，这些数据加在一起，标志着野生动物源冠状病毒是一种“明确和当前的危险”，许多冠状病毒具有大流行的潜力。
Over the past decade, the Ecological Health Alliance, in collaboration with Chinese scientists, has collected samples of more than 10,000 bats and about 2,000 other mammals in southern China, and discovered 52 new SARS-related coronavirus, 122 other types of other coronavirus, more than 350 new types of coronavirus and a new "pedigree E" strain of coronavirus evolution.
Olival 参与的另一项研究建立了分析模型，试图对 EID 进行评估，结果显示，适合EID发生的地区在整个大陆上原本分布相对均匀。
Another study, in which Olival participated, created an analytical model to try to assess the EID, showing that areas suitable for EID occurrence were originally distributed relatively evenly across the continent.
理论上，在热带森林环境及哺乳动物生物多样性较高的地区，EID 的风险指数会有所提高。
Theoretically, the EID risk index would increase in areas with high tropical forest environments and mammalian biodiversity.
但在自然环境条件基础上，人口密集地区例如欧洲、美国、亚洲和拉丁美洲的许多国家和城市，EID 风险指数则会叠加。
However, based on natural environmental conditions, the EID risk index is superimposed in many countries and cities in densely populated areas, such as Europe, the United States, Asia and Latin America.

李泓萤曾与 Olival 一起参与蝙蝠相关研究，到中国采集样本。
Li, who worked with Olival on bat-related research, traveled to China to collect samples.
她发现，中国南方地区的一些村民可能会有多种方式无意间接触到了蝙蝠的唾液或排泄物，甚至生活在蝙蝠巢穴附近。
She found that some villagers in southern China may have unwittingly come into contact with bat saliva or excrement in a variety of ways, even living near bats' nests.
在调研中有很多人报告说：发现蝙蝠栖息在自己家中，有蝙蝠飞进了我的房子，我杀死了它或发现蝙蝠吃了院子里的果实。
Many people in the study reported that bats were found perched in their own homes, that bats flew into my house, that I killed them, or that bats ate the fruit of the yard.
夏天的时候，有些蝙蝠藏身的洞穴可能成为了人们缓解炎热的聚会场所，团队去洞穴搜寻蝙蝠采样时，通常会看到人们留下的啤酒瓶和水瓶。
In summer, some of the bats hiding in caves may have become a place to cool off the heat. When the team goes to search for bats for samples, they usually see beer bottles and water bottles left behind.
当询问当地人会抓蝙蝠卖给餐馆吗？有受访者回答是的，“据说蝙蝠可以预防癌症”，“为生命提供营养” 。
When asked whether bats are sold to restaurants, one respondent said yes, "bats are said to prevent cancer" and "provide nourishment for life."
总体而言，许多参与调研者表示，近年来野生动物的狩猎，贸易或消费活动有所减少；然而，当地仍有狩猎或食用一些野生动物（例如啮齿动物，蝙蝠、野猫、青蛙、蛇和鸟）的行为以娱乐或增加收入，许多人还相信野生动物或其副产品具有保健作用。
In general, many participants indicated that hunting, trading or consumption of wildlife has decreased in recent years; however, hunting or eating some wildlife (such as rodents, bats, wildcats, frogs, snakes and birds) continues to be practised or increased for recreational or income-generating activities, and many believe that wildlife or its by-products have health benefits.
从 2015 年 10 月到 2017 年 7 月，李泓萤团队曾对来自云南（761）、广西（412）和广东（423）省的 8 个地点的总共 1596 名居民进行了调研，通过对血清样本中的蝙蝠传播的冠状病毒进行测试，9 名参与者（0.6％）的蝙蝠冠状病毒测试呈阳性，另有 265 名（17％）参与者报告出现过严重的急性呼吸道感染（SARI）或类似流感的疾病（ILI）症状，这些症状与家禽、食肉动物、啮齿动物或蝙蝠接触有关。
From October 2015 to July 2017, a total of 1596 residents from eight locations in Yunnan (761), Guangxi (412) and Guangdong (423) provinces were tested positive for bat coronavirus test. Nine participants (0.6%) reported severe acute respiratory infections (ARIs) or influenza-like diseases (ILI) symptoms associated with poultry, predators, rodents or bats.
图｜动物接触的分类和活动，右上角的红色数字表示在该组中血清检测呈阳性的人群数量(来源：ScienceDirect）调研观察到冠状病毒可能已经扩散到人类，但这些都是未被重视的小规模疫情，即便个别感染病毒的人已有病情症状，但却不足以确定流行传播风险并引起当地卫生当局采取有力措施。
The classification and activity of exposure of animals, the red number at the top right corner indicates that the coronavirus may have spread to humans in this group, but these are minor, unrecognized outbreaks that, even if individually infected, are not sufficient to determine the risk of epidemic transmission and prompt strong action by local health authorities.
03冠状病毒还会卷土重来么？这次新冠病毒暴发之前，其实已有两次冠状病毒在中国肆虐，均造成了不容忽视的公共卫生事件和不同程度的经济损伤，所幸，不是所有病毒都感染到了人。
Will the coronavirus return? Before the outbreak of the new coronavirus, two coronavirus outbreaks occurred in China, causing public health incidents and varying degrees of economic damage. Fortunately, not all of the coronavirus infected people.
SARS-CoV 起源于中国广东，然后传播到世界多地，在 2002–2003 年大流行期间感染了超过 8000人，总死亡率为 10％，而另一种 SADS-CoV 在 2016-2017 年袭击了养猪业，造成了 2 万多头仔猪死亡。
The SARS-CoV originated in Guangdong, China, and then spread to many parts of the world, infecting more than 8,000 people during the 2002-2003 pandemic, with an overall mortality rate of 10 per cent, while another SADS-CoV attack on pig farming in 2016-2017 killed more than 20,000 piglets.
蝙蝠被认为是重要的冠状病毒自然宿主，将冠状病毒与蝙蝠研究联系起来，对于中国疫情防控而言有一定参考意义。
Bats are considered to be important natural hosts of coronavirus. The association of coronavirus with bat research is of some significance for the prevention and control of this disease in China.
研究者普遍认为，蝙蝠型冠状病毒将重新出现，引发下一次疾病暴发，在这方面，中国可能是一个高风险区。
Researchers generally believe that the bat-like coronavirus will reappear, triggering the next outbreak of the disease, and that China could be a high-risk area in this regard.
而面临的巨大挑战是预警何时何地可能会发生，以便我们尽力防止灾难不断重演。
The great challenge is to warn when and where it may happen so that we can do our best to prevent a repeat of the disaster.
2019 年 3 月，中国科学院武汉病毒研究所石正丽团队曾发表一篇论文对蝙蝠冠状病毒在中国的分布进行研究，揭示了中国蝙蝠冠状病毒及其对应的蝙蝠宿主的地理分布。
In March 2019, the team from Wuhan Virus Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences published a paper on the distribution of the bat coronavirus in China, revealing the geographical distribution of the Chinese bat coronavirus and its corresponding bat host.
如下图所示，每个红色框代表在该特定蝙蝠物种中发现的一个 CoV 阳性样品，对于报告有 CoV 阳性样本的每个省都绘制一个点矩阵，指出蝙蝠种类和病毒种类的缩写。
As shown in the figure below, each red box represents a CoV-positive sample found in that particular bat species, and for each province reporting a CoV-positive sample, a point matrix is drawn indicating the bat species and the abbreviation for the virus type.
先后暴发过 SARS 和 SADS 的广东省用红色圆圈特意圈出，此外，我们可以看到，云南、贵州、湖北的分布多样性和集群性都比较高，也可能是病毒溢出的热点区域。
Guangdong Province, which has experienced outbreaks of SARS and SDS, has been marked by red circles. In addition, Yunnan, Guizhou and Hubei all have high distribution and clustering characteristics, and may be hotspots for virus spills.
此次湖北成为新冠疫情重灾区，似乎侧面印证了这一点。
This time Hubei becomes the new crown epidemic disaster area, seems to confirm this point side by side.
图｜蝙蝠冠状病毒在中国的分布（来源：VIRUSES）为了预测下一次由冠状病毒引发的疫情，石正丽团队曾在论文中列出可能导致冠状病毒暴发的一般因素。
Distribution of the coronavirus in China (Source: VIRUSES) To predict the next coronavirus-induced outbreak, Shi Zhengli's team has written about the common factors that could lead to a coronavirus outbreak.
首先，蝙蝠拥有大量高度多样化的冠状病毒，众所周知，冠状病毒基因组在感染期间会定期重组，而丰富的基因库可以促进这一过程；其次，蝙蝠种类广泛分布并且生活在人类附近；第三，病毒是致病性和可传播的。
First, bats possess a large number of highly diverse coronavirus (coronavirus). It is well known that the coronavirus genome will be regularly recombinant during the infection and that a rich gene pool can facilitate this process. Secondly, bat species are widely distributed and live close to humans.
这种情况下，在中国暴发 SARS-CoV、SADS-CoV 和如今的新冠病毒似乎并不是巧合，值得注意的是还有其他热点冠状病毒尚未引起流行，应该对其进行密切监视。
In this context, the outbreak of SARS-CoV, SDS-CoV and now the new crown virus in China does not seem to be a coincidence. It is noteworthy that other coronavirus hotspots have not yet caught on and should be closely monitored.
尽管致命的新冠病毒在中国蔓延的确切方式以及如何从动物向人体入侵，仍然是一个谜，但科学家普遍认为，这与城市人口密集流动以及混乱、管制松散的免费开放市场密切相关。
While the exact manner in which the deadly new crown virus is spreading in China and how to invade from animals to humans remains a mystery, scientists generally agree that it is closely linked to urban agglomerations and chaotic, loosely regulated free markets.
在中国南方部分城市，以及越南、印度尼西亚和东南亚其他地区都有所谓的湿货市场，其中有野生和驯养的动物交叉圈养，且几乎都是不太卫生的宰杀方式，这些因素都为病毒溢出提供了完美的混合环境，如果不加节制，每隔几年出现致命的新病毒或不可避免。
The existence of so-called wet markets in parts of southern China, as well as in Viet Nam, Indonesia and other parts of South-East Asia, with wild and domesticated animals in cross-breeding and almost all less hygienic slaughter practices, provide a perfect mix of viruses that, if left unchecked, generate deadly new viruses or inescapable every few years.
在很多湿货市场中，蛇、蝙蝠或者其他野生动物被一起堆放在铁丝网笼里，而中国的传统饮食文化也普遍认为新鲜宰杀的活物更具营养。
In many wet markets, snakes, bats and other wild animals are stacked together in barbed wire cages, while traditional Chinese food cultures generally agree that fresh animals are more nutritious.
携带病毒的多种液体和分泌物交叉混合在一起，有助于产生新的病毒，尤其是当这些动物在顾客面前被宰杀时，这都可能会增加病毒感染到更多人的概率。
A cross-mix of viral liquids and secretions can help create new viruses, especially when the animals are slaughtered in front of customers, which can increase the probability of a virus infecting more people.
此外，过去发生了疫情可能仅在局部区域造成影响。
In addition, past outbreaks may have affected only local areas.
而现在，随着流动人口激增以及航空、高铁、高速等基础设施的加速，蝙蝠病毒从丛林深处被带进市场之后，可能在几天内就可传播到全球各个角落。
And now, with the explosion of mobile populations and the acceleration of infrastructure such as aviation, high-speed rail, and so on, bat viruses can spread to every corner of the globe within days of being brought into the market from deep within the jungle.
04预防下一次病毒大流行的策略现实总是比理想更残酷。
The strategic reality of preventing the next virus pandemic is always harsher than ideal.
虽然关于蝙蝠病毒和相关病毒的研究投入了科研人员们的巨大心血，但新型冠状病毒还是在中国境内和国际上进行了感染扩散，尽管现代医学技术能分析蝙蝠起源的相关冠状病毒的所有特征，但导致人类感染的病毒溢出机制仍不确定。
Although researchers have put a lot of effort into the investigation of the bat virus and related viruses, the new coronavirus has spread throughout China and internationally. Although modern medical technology can analyze all the characteristics of coronavirus associated with bat origin, the mechanism of virus spillover that causes infection in humans remains uncertain.
不过，毫无疑问的是，野生动植物贸易具有使人们接近野生动植物携带的病原体的固有风险，我们需要立即思考以准备防止下一次新冠病毒的大流行。
There is no doubt, however, that the wildlife trade carries an inherent risk of bringing people closer to pathogens carried by wild fauna and flora, and we need to think immediately to prepare for the next pandemic of the new crown virus.
对此，Peter Daszak、Kevin Olival 和李泓萤通过一份报告提出了几点针对性的预防策略：1、对野生动植物进行高危病原体监测。
In response, Peter Daszak, Kevin Olival and Li Wang-firefly have adopted a report proposing several targeted prevention strategies: 1.
这也是疫情预警中最关键的问题，中国野生生物中的病毒株种类繁多，在人类中出现的概率很高，这敦促相关领域的科学家们需努力发现所有这些病毒，以便对它们进行分类，开发一个用于快速病原体鉴定和风险评估的参考库，并测试针对热点病毒的疫苗和疗法。
This is also the most critical issue in the early warning of the epidemic, with a wide variety of virus strains in Chinese wildlife and a high probability of occurrence in humans, prompting scientists in the relevant fields to work on discovering all these viruses in order to categorize them, develop a reference library for rapid pathogen identification and risk assessment, and test vaccines and treatments for hot-spot viruses.
2、监测和降低与野生生物接触的高风险人群的风险。
2. Monitor and reduce risks to high-risk populations exposed to wildlife.
单个病例或一小群人感染可能会避开监测，尤其是在中国医疗卫生能力较弱的地区或人们未及时寻求诊断或治疗的农村地区。
Individual cases or a small group of people may avoid surveillance, especially in areas of China where health capacity is weak or where people do not seek diagnosis or treatment in a timely manner.
地方公共卫生当局可以设计监测计划，以识别生活在野生动植物多样性很高且新型病毒危险系数较高的区域；可以将与野生动物或家养动物频繁接触、以此为生计的人以及病因不明的急性呼吸道感染或流感样疾病症状的患者纳入监测范围，作为一种具有成本效益的方法，识别新型病毒溢出。
Local public health authorities can design surveillance plans to identify areas with high wildlife diversity and high risk factors for new viruses; people who are in frequent contact with wildlife or domestic animals for their livelihood and patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infections or influenza-like diseases of unknown etiology can be monitored as a cost-effective way to identify new types of virus spills.
这种“暴发前监测”的策略可以与公共卫生、医疗保健、农业和林业等不同部门进行协调，与研究机构合作实施对野生动植物、家畜和人类的样本采集和测试，进而鉴定高危人群和潜在危险因素。
Such "pre-outbreak monitoring" strategies could be coordinated with different sectors, such as public health, health care, agriculture and forestry, working with research institutions to collect and test samples of wildlife, livestock and humans in order to identify high-risk populations and potential risk factors.
3、改善野生动植物贸易和动物市场的生物安全。
Improve biosafety in wildlife trade and animal markets.
在中国进行的行为风险调查中确定，低水平的环境生物安全性和高水平的人-动物接触是人畜共患病出现的关键风险因素，特别是在当地的湿货市场和动物市场，尽管目前的强制性野生动物贸易禁令可能在此时有助于疾病控制，但要防止未来疾病的出现，市场生物安全仍需要在卫生条例、卫生设施以及市场交易动物的来源方面得到有力的监察。
Low levels of environmental biosecurity and high levels of human-animal exposure have been identified in behavioural risk surveys in China as key risk factors for zoonoses, particularly in local wet and animal markets. While the current mandatory wildlife trade ban may help disease control at this time, market biosecurity still requires strong scrutiny in terms of health regulations, sanitation facilities and sources of commercially traded animals.
李泓萤在回复 DeepTech 的邮件中提到，总的来说，在过往的调研中仍有很多局限性，由于血清阳性率较低，因此无法确切评估蝙蝠冠状病毒溢出的风险，检测到的血清阳性少数案例也与蝙蝠直接接触无关，所以对于预防策略，只能笼统地说减少人与野生动物的接触，增加环境生物安全。
In response to DeepTech's e-mail, Li said that overall, there were limitations in previous studies. Because of the low seroprevalence rate, the risk of bat coronavirus spills could not be accurately assessed, and the few seropositive cases detected had no direct contact with bats.
而疾病发生的很大驱动力之一也与人类活动密切相关，人类活动在全球范围内不断扩大，包括森林砍伐、农业集约化和野生动植物贸易，这导致动物与人接触的频率大幅提升，新型疾病出现和传播的可能性呈指数增长，大流行病在未来或将变得更加频繁和破坏性更大。
One of the major drivers of disease is also closely linked to human activity, which is expanding globally, including deforestation, agricultural intensification and wildlife trade, which has led to a significant increase in animal-to-human contact, exponential increases in the likelihood of the emergence and spread of new diseases, and pandemics that may become more frequent and devastating in the future.
我们正面临未知，全球环境变化正在推动着新型疾病的出现。
We are facing the unknown, and global environmental change is driving the emergence of new diseases.
