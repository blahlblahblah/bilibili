韩国新增患者趋势明显放缓。
South Korea's new patient trend has slowed markedly.
疫情暴发一个月，韩国如何控制蔓延？韩国疫情可分三个阶段：1月20日确诊首个病例至2月18日，以防堵和抑制社区传播为核心；2月19日至3月中旬，“新天地教会”集体感染致疫情暴发，大邱和庆尚北道成“重灾区”；3月10日至今，新增病例数回落，13日韩国单日治愈患者人数首次超过新增确诊人数。
South Korea's first case was diagnosed on January 20, with containment and suppression of community transmission at its core. From February 19 to mid-March, the outbreak was caused by a mass infection in Daegu and Gyeongshan North Province.
韩国官方称，疫情暴发“出现放缓势头”，大邱等地病例增势已到拐点。
South Korean officials said the outbreak of "slow down", Daegu and other places have reached the inflection point.
没有封城，韩国如何控制疫情？公共卫生应急体系发挥重要作用。
Without containment, how does South Korea control the epidemic? Public-health emergency systems play an important role.
2015年中东呼吸综合征疫情后，韩国加大传染病管理体系改革：将韩国疾病管理本部提升为副部级机构，专门负责防疫；并逐步构建完整的诊断、患者管理、应急指挥等体系。
In the wake of the 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome epidemic, the Republic of Korea stepped up the reform of its infectious disease management system: upgrading the Korea Disease Control Headquarters to a vice-ministerial agency specializing in epidemic prevention; and gradually building a complete system of diagnosis, patient management, and emergency command.
今年1月20日，韩国发现首个确诊病例后，保健福祉部和疾病管理本部成立中央防疫对策本部，24小时运转。
Following the discovery of the first confirmed case in Korea on 20 January this year, the Ministry of Health and Welfare and the Department of Disease Control established the Central Prevention Response Headquarters, which operates 24 hours a day.
2月23日，韩国发布最高级红色预警后，又成立以国务总理为负责人的中央灾难安全对策本部，由总理担任本部长属首次。
On February 23, the Republic of Korea issued a top-level red alert, and set up the Central Disaster Security Response Headquarters headed by the Prime Minister, the first of its kind.
至此，两个对策本部成为“总指挥”，既保障从中央到地方的“一盘棋”，也以专业医疗人士为核心，协调各方资源。
At this point, the two countermeasure headquarters become "the general director," not only guarantees from the central government to the local, but also takes the professional medical personnel as the core, coordinates each party's resources.
超强的病毒检测能力，也是疫情防控的“功臣”。
Super virus detection ability, is also the disease prevention and control of the "credit."
早在1月中旬，韩国便着手研发病毒检测试剂盒。
As early as mid-January, South Korea began to develop a virus detection kit.
2月初，首批试剂盒投入医院，有4家制作公司、100多个实验室分析结果，6小时即可诊断。
At the beginning of February, the first kits were put into the hospital and the results were analysed by four production companies and over 100 laboratories, ready for diagnosis within six hours.
为便捷民众检测，韩国大幅放宽检测条件：有疑似症状均可检测，全免费。
In order to facilitate public testing, South Korea greatly relaxed the test conditions: suspected symptoms can be tested, all free of charge.
“免下车”筛查法最引人关注。
The "off-the-bus" screening method is the most interesting.
记者在首尔一个车辆移动式筛查站看到，类似快餐店免下车取餐服务，司机只需摇下窗户、张开嘴，即可接受检测；相比传统30分钟的时间，此筛查只需10多分钟。
Drivers who roll down windows and open their mouths can take the test, compared with the traditional 30-minute screening, which takes just over 10 minutes, according to a mobile screening station in Seoul.
韩国中央防疫对策本部副本部长权埈郁称，“免下车”筛查极大减少人员感染风险。
Korean Central Anti-epidemic Policy copy Minister Jun Jun Yu said "off-the-bus" screening greatly reduces the risk of human infection.
尽管日本防疫部门对筛查准确性提出质疑，但韩国政府称，美国、德国等均在引入此法。
Although Japan's immunization authorities have questioned the accuracy of the screening, South Korea's government says the law is being introduced in the United States, Germany and elsewhere.
数据显示，截至19日零时，官方已对约30.7万人进行病毒检测。
Some 307,000 people had been tested for the virus by 0 pm on the 19th, according to the data.
这意味着，韩国每170人中，就有1人接受了检测。
This means that one in 170 people in South Korea has been tested.
韩国中央事故处理本部副本部长金刚立称，大规模筛查能尽早发现患者，降低重症风险，“是遏制疫情蔓延最重要的一个方式”。
Kim Gangli, copy minister of the Central Incident Management Department, said mass screening "is one of the most important ways to contain the spread of the epidemic" by identifying patients early and reducing the risk of serious illness.
缓解“一床难求”，韩国采取分类治疗：将患者以病情程度分为轻、中、重、最重四级，轻症者进入生活治疗中心，严重者入院治疗。
To ease the "one bed difficult to find," the Republic of Korea adopted a classification of treatment: patients classified as mild, moderate, heavy, the most severe four, light patients into life treatment centers, serious hospital treatment.
生活治疗中心以教育院、企业员工宿舍等为基础改建，集中隔离和治疗，类似改良版中国的“方舱医院”。
Life treatment centers are rebuilt on the basis of educational institutions, dormitories for enterprise employees, and concentrate on isolation and treatment, similar to the improved version of China's "square cabin hospital."
在大邱等地，韩国虽未“封城”，但采取严格管控。
In places such as Daegu, South Korea is not "closed" but strictly controlled.
每位居家隔离者由专人监督，若违反隔离规定，将面临刑事诉讼或罚款。
Every person placed in isolation is supervised by a person who is liable to criminal proceedings or a fine if the segregation is violated.
患者行踪路线也在网络公开。
The patient's trail is also open on the Internet.
只要打开地图、输入位置，便会出现一个个小亮点，标明附近确诊患者路线，精确到咖啡厅、酒店等具体信息。
Just open the map, enter the position, will appear one by one small bright spot, indicating nearby confirmed patient route, accurate to coffee shop, hotel and other specific information.
权埈郁称，公布患者路线是以公众利益为考量；为核实患者路线，还调取监控录像、追查信用卡记录等。
Kuan Jun Yu said that the disclosure of patient routes is considered to be in the public interest; to verify patient routes, surveillance videos, tracking credit card records, etc.
尽管态势趋缓，但韩国疫情远未到平息之时。
Despite the slowdown, the South Korean epidemic is far from over.
近来，聚集感染频发。
Aggregate infections have become common in recent years.
继首尔呼叫中心、京畿道教会等相继引发集体感染后，3月19日韩国大邱一疗养院又出现交叉感染。
After Seoul Call Center, Gyeonggi Province Church and other collective infections, March 19, South Korea Daegu a sanatorium emerged cross-infection.
24小时内，韩国新增患者152例，尽管与峰值时日增近千人相比明显下降，但这是连续4天新增患者低于百例后，出现小幅反弹。
Within 24 hours, there were 152 new cases in South Korea, a small rebound after four consecutive days of fewer than 100 new cases, despite a sharp drop from a peak of nearly 1,000.
韩国中央事故处理本部防疫部门负责人尹泰皓在当天记者会上称，对集体感染和境外输入病例高度关注，“尽管有困难，但要求公众继续配合防疫工作。
Speaking at a press conference on the same day, the head of the anti-epidemic department of the Central Incident Management Department, Yin Taihao, said: "Despite the difficulties, the public is urged to continue to cooperate with the epidemic prevention efforts.
