你印象中的武汉是什么样的？这座位于华中地区的省会城市充满着生命力，夏天够热，热干面是他们最常见的美食，闲下来的老人们会聚在街头巷尾打牌，春节是他们最热闹的节日，有归乡的年轻人，有早早就置办年货的老人，有火红的对联和热情的拜年。
This capital city in central China is full of vitality, hot summer, hot and dry noodles are their most common food, idle old people will gather at the end of the streets and play cards, Spring Festival is their most popular holiday, there are young people back home, there are early purchase of New Year goods, red couplets and warm New Year.
2020 年春天，武汉人的春节是灰色的。
In spring 2020, Wuhan people's Spring Festival is gray.
新冠病毒的肆虐把他们原本的闲逸生活摔在地上打了个粉碎。
The onslaught of the new crown virus shattered their otherwise idle lives on the ground.
我们努力地找到了几个武汉人，他们跟我们讲述了他们从疫情开始至今的生活变化。
We managed to find a few Wuhan people who told us about the changes in their lives since the outbreak began.
他们是幸运儿，毕竟身处这座城市之中，「生死之外，皆是小事」。
They are lucky, after all, in this city, "life and death, all is a small matter."
接受我们采访的三个人截至目前都没有成为这次新冠病毒的携带者，他们幸运地以各种各样的方式逃过了这一劫。
None of the three people we interviewed have been carriers of the new crown virus so far, and they have been lucky enough to escape in a variety of ways.
他们当中有孕晚期的准妈妈，有不得不被隔离在工作城市一个人过节的武汉女孩，有回到老家便不得不隔离的北漂男孩。
Among them are expectant mothers-to-be, Wuhan girls who have to be quarantined in the city where they work, and boys who have to be quarantined when they return home.
他们见证了这一个月的城市变化，我们记录下他们的故事，也带大家看看一个武汉普通人在这个一波三折的春节里的不平凡生活。
They witnessed the city changes this month, we recorded their stories, but also take a look at the ordinary Wuhan people in this ups and downs of the Spring Festival extraordinary life.
三个人都与我们说过同样的话：「2020 年的春节，我可能一辈子都忘不掉。
All three said the same thing to us: "2020 Spring Festival, I will probably never forget.
」 他对窗外喊出了「武汉加油」Max男武汉人、未感染25 岁长居北京，广告公司普通员工北漂 3 年半，工资 8000+北漂男孩 Max 是距离新冠病毒最近的一个，他的邻居就因为患病入院。
He shouted out the window, "Come on, Wuhan!" Max, an uninfected 25-year-old resident of Beijing, the average employee of an advertising agency, moved north for three and a half years, and the salary of 8000 + North Drift Boy Max was the closest to the new crown virus.
他也是最安全的一个，他在病毒肆虐期间选择了自我禁闭。
He was also the safest. He chose to lock himself up during the virus.
可让他忧心的，不止有抗疫一件事这么简单。
What worried him was more than the simple fact of fighting the plague.
如果不是因为突如其来的肺炎，Max 可能已经在 20 天前就回到北京继续他的工作，按照年轻人当下流行的说法，这叫「搬砖」。
Had it not been for the sudden onset of pneumonia, Max would have returned to Beijing 20 days ago to continue his work.
2016 年从大学毕业，年轻的 Max 就开始了他的北漂生活。
After graduating from college in 2016, young Max began his North drift.
独在异乡，他常以故乡为荣，哪怕周末和朋友聚餐的时候，他也喜欢点上一道湖北菜，然后细细品，有时候皱着眉头，说这个做得不地道，那一道可以再辣一些。
Even when dining with his friends on weekends, he likes to order a Hubei dish, then fine, and sometimes frown, saying that this is not authentic, that one can be hotter.
北漂期间，Max 先后换了几份工作，因为大学的主修专业是房地产经营管理，他毕业的第一份工作是在北京的一家房地产公司做策划。
During the period, Max changed jobs because his major was real estate management and his first job was planning for a real estate company in Beijing.
「年轻人体力好，我也不怕吃苦，闯呗。
"Young men are strong, and I am not afraid of hardship.
」风里来雨里去的生活被他一笔带过。
"The wind and the rain came and went.
若是再往早算，从大二开始，他就开始在武汉当地的一家无印良品店做小时工，至今店里哪个商品性价比高，哪个产品畅销，他还记得一清二楚。
If the early calculation, from sophomore, he began to do a small-time work in Wuhan, a local non-print quality goods shop, the store, which cost-effective, which product best-selling, he still remember clearly.
在北京的工作够累，可他始终保持着每天和在武汉的父母通一次电话的习惯，多数是在晚上下班后，睡觉前。
Tired as he was at work in Beijing, he always kept the habit of talking to his parents on the phone once a day, mostly after work at night, before going to bed.
有时是视频，有时是打一个微信电话。
Sometimes a video, sometimes a microphone call.
用标准的武汉话：「我才 25 岁，他们就催我结婚，让我赶紧带女朋友回家，烦。
In the standard Wuhan dialect: "I am only 25 years old, they rushed me to marry, let me hurry to take my girlfriend home, annoy.
」即便是顶着长辈的唠叨，春节过年终归还是要回家的。
"Even in spite of the nagging of the elders, the Spring Festival is still coming home.
1 月 19 日，收拾好行囊的 Max 提前预支了 2020 年的一部分年假，好容易抢到了从北京起飞的机票，兴冲冲地启程直奔武汉，他的家乡。
On January 19th, pack-ready Max prepaid part of his 2020 annual leave, managed to land a flight from Beijing and headed for Wuhan, his hometown.
上飞机前，母亲在电话那端叮嘱：「最近武汉有流行病，你下飞机可能要被检查体温。
Before boarding the plane, my mother said on the phone: "Wuhan has an epidemic recently. You may have to have your temperature checked if you get off the plane.
」每年春节前的天河国际机场都是熙熙攘攘，人来人往，今年也不例外，这座湖北的省会城市人流向来密集，一群人正大包小裹地赶上回家的旅程，只为了春节能与家人实现来之不易的团圆，而他们不知道，潜在的危险也在一步步靠近他们。
Every year before the Spring Festival, the Tianhe International Airport is bustling with people coming and going. This year is no exception. People from the capital city of Hubei Province are flocking to the city.
2020 年的春节，这里出现的每个人都将过得不同往常。
In the Spring Festival 2020, everyone here will be living a different life.
年轻人再次回到熟悉的老地方，一切完全没有变化，站台随处可见摩肩接踵的人们，他们脸上有旅途劳顿，却掩盖不住对故土的热盼。
The young people return to their old familiar places, where nothing has changed at all, the jostlers are everywhere on the platform, their faces are overburdened with travel, but their yearning for their homeland cannot be concealed.
没有人给大家测体温，一切看起来风平浪静。
No one took the temperature. Everything looked calm.
「当时没多想，只觉得上一代人总是喜欢过度担忧。
"I didn't think about it, but I think a generation ago was always worried too much.
」Max 提着拉杆箱一路小跑地回家，未来几天的生活他已经在微信里和老家的朋友们安排好了，一天后的 20 日晚上，他就与几个朋友一起约了顿久别重逢的老友会。
Max trotted home with his trunks and spent the next few days making plans with his friends back home. On the evening of the 20th he made an appointment with a few friends for a long time.
「晚上出门的时候，我看到街上有一些人开始戴口罩，神情有点紧张。
"When I went out at night, I saw some people in the street wearing masks and looking a little nervous.
」23 日，武汉宣布封城的时候，Max 和家人正一起包除夕夜的饺子。
"When Wuhan announced the city's closure on February 23, Max and his family were making dumplings for New Year's Eve.
主持人的语气非常严肃，全家人不由自主地停下手里的活计，一起看着电视里的新闻，房间里沉默，非常沉默。
The host's tone was so serious that the family could not help stopping their work and watching the news on TV.
「我们当时不知道这病到底有多严重，有多大的危害性，也不知道即将发生什么。
"We didn't know how serious it was, how dangerous it was, or what was about to happen.
但我们都很清楚封城代表着什么，父母和再上一辈都是地道的老武汉人，他们从未遇到过封城这样的事件，那感觉像是一个恐怖电影，缓缓地拉开了序幕。
But we all know what it means, parents and the previous generation are authentic old Wuhan people, they have never encountered such an event, it feels like a horror film, slowly opened the prelude.
」被烟云笼罩，空无一人的月湖桥朋友圈里一下子被「新冠肺炎」的新闻灌满了，人们惊恐于它的传染性之高，速度之快。
The empty circle of friends at Yuehu Bridge, shrouded in smoke, was suddenly filled with news of the New Crown Pneumonia, and people were horrified by its high rate of infection and speed.
因为恐惧，人们开始谈武汉色变。
Because of fear, people began to talk about Wuhan color change.
「我知道他们不是怕武汉人，他们只是怕死，可是我们武汉人就该死吗？」Max 说到这里的时候情绪有点激动。
"I know they're not afraid of Wuhan people, they're just afraid of death, but do we Wuhan people deserve to die?
家里人还就这场突然降临的灾情专门开了一次的家庭会议，毕竟日子还要过。
The family also held a special family meeting on the sudden disaster. After all, the day was still ahead.
讨论的结果是：除了每隔几天就要去单位值班的妈妈，其他的人都不要出门。
The result of the discussion was that no one was to go out except Mom, who was on duty every few days.
母亲因为工作出门回家前，带回全家人未来几天的生活必备品，完成采购任务。
Mother because of work to go home, bring back the family in the next few days of life necessities, complete the procurement task.
这样被感染的几率最小，也最能节省口罩。
This is the least likely way to get infected and the best way to save masks.
「一旦我们家里现存的这批口罩用光了，估计一大段时间是再买不到口罩的，这是个非常现实的问题。
"Once we run out of these masks, it is very realistic to expect that we will not be able to buy them again for a long time.
」Max 家里仅存的一些常备的基础消炎药和口罩，酒精已经见了底「通风是我家目前最经常做的防护，尽量让空气流通。
"Max's last remaining stock of basic anti-inflammatory drugs and masks is alcohol." Ventilation is the most common protection my family currently takes to keep the air flowing.
」在所有购物平台都买不到酒精，买不到 84 消毒液的情况下，Max 和家里人想到的最物美价廉的防疫方式就是通风和洗手。
"When alcohol and disinfectant 84 are not available on all shopping platforms, ventilation and hand-washing are the best ways Max and his family can think of for prevention.
「毕竟我家附近已经先后好几个人感染了病毒，旁边一栋楼就有病患，对面一栋楼也出现了疑似患者。
"After all, several people have been infected with the virus near my home. There is a patient in a nearby building and a suspected patient in a building across the street.
其实回家的第三天我就感冒了，当时非常紧张，以为自己在飞机上或者在机场也『中招』了。
In fact, the third day I came home with a cold, at that time very nervous, think he was on the plane or in the airport 'recruit'.
好在那时候疫情还没有这么严重，我自己在家吃了点感冒药，竟然好了，这才长出一口气。
Fortunately, the outbreak was not so serious, I took some cold medicine at home, even better, only to take a breath.
」「封城之后的武汉人心理状态都差不多，我们还自发地组织了活动：在一天晚上打开窗户，一起喊『武汉加油』，看上去很傻对不对？那天晚上的活动是我妈先参加的，我看她在对着窗口喊武汉加油，外面很多声音此起彼伏。
"Wuhan people after the closure of the city are similar psychological state, we also organized spontaneous activities: one night open the windows, shouting together" Wuhan refueling, "look very silly, right? That night's activities were attended by my mother, I watched her shout at the window, Wuhan refueling, many voices outside.
我也过去陪她一起。
I'll go with her, too.
其实那个时候除了这四个字我们不知道还应该说些什么。
In fact, we did not know what to say at that time except these four words.
我看到邻居和对面楼的住户也都在声嘶力竭地喊着，一刹那我差点掉眼泪。
I saw my neighbor and the occupants of the opposite building shouting at the top of their lungs. For a moment I almost cried.
与其说我们是在给这个城市加油，不如说是给自己加油，都不能说是给自己加油，就是给自己一个释放的途径。
We are not so much to refuel the city, as to refuel themselves, can not be said to their refueling, is to give themselves a way to release.
人们太压抑了，总是需要一些动力的。
People are so depressed, they always need some motivation.
」Max 说到这里的时候吸了一下鼻子。
"Max sniffed as he said this.
采访 Max 时他发给我的截屏，根据软件数字统计，当时武汉的确诊病例有 45027 人，但已无法显示患者所在的具体区域。
According to software statistics, there were 45,027 confirmed cases in Wuhan at the time, but it was no longer possible to show the exact area in which the patient was located.
没法跟家里人说的麻烦事还有一个，也是他的顾虑。
There was another trouble he could not tell his family about, and that was also his concern.
回北京复工的时间遥遥无期，他租在东四环的房子的房租还要按月缴纳。
When he returned to Beijing for work, he still had to pay a monthly rent on the house he rented in the Eastern Fourth Ring Road.
如果没有这次的事件，25 岁的 Max 每个月可以从老板手里领到 8 千块的工资，足以支付房租和日常基本的生活费。
If it hadn't been for the incident, Max, 25, would have been paid $8,000 a month from his boss, enough to pay the rent and basic daily living expenses.
「我可能这两天还要跟房东通个电话，请他通融一下，争取把我的房租顺延一些时间，希望他能理解。
"I'll probably call the landlord again these two days and ask for his indulgence in trying to extend my rent for a little longer. I hope he understands.
但我又有点担心，生怕他因为担心我是武汉人就不再续租房子给我，让我搬家走人。
But I was a little worried that he would not renew my house for fear that I was Wuhan people, let me move away.
这几天我要好好组织下语言，想想到底怎么跟人家说比较合适。
I want to organize my language well these days and think about how to say it properly.
」不出门的日子，Max 大多数时间在盯着窗外看着熟悉的环境。
"Max spent most of the day staring out of the window at the familiar surroundings.
「就像是一只关在笼子里的鸟。
"It's like a bird in a cage.
我出不去，但想知道这个城市正在发生些什么。
I can't get out, but I want to know what's going on in this city.
」这套房子是去年家里人卖了旧房子加了不少积蓄买下来的，他一直在其他城市工作，只有过年才回来一次。
The family sold the old house last year and bought it with a lot of savings. He has been working in other cities and only comes back once in the New Year.
这个本不够熟悉的窗外环境因为无聊，如今已经被他看到烂熟于心。
The unfamiliar environment outside the window was now familiar to him because of boredom.
「一天夜里我正睡得熟，突然听楼下有救护车的尖叫声，靠近我家楼下的时候声音突然消失了。
"I was fast asleep one night when I heard an ambulance screech downstairs and suddenly my voice died away as I approached my downstairs.
我当时蛮紧张的，马上从床上跳起来凑近窗户，只看得到救护车的灯在闪，但看不清接了谁离开。
I was so nervous that I jumped out of bed and came close to the window. I could only see the ambulance lights flashing, but I couldn't see who was leaving.
我当天晚上就失眠了，总是觉得这个声音忽远忽近，一闭眼，就会觉得它还会在耳边突然就响起来。
I had insomnia that night, always feel this voice far and near, a close eye, will feel it will suddenly ring in the ear.
」「家里人目前为止还算健康，没有什么发病的状况。
"The family is healthy so far and there is nothing wrong with it.
我们经常因为这件事讨论，我爸说，如果最终每个家庭成员都能平安无事地挺过来，接下来的生活里我们要做到三件事：多存钱，多运动，常联系。
We often talk about it, and my dad says that if eventually every family member comes out safe, there are three things we need to do in the rest of our lives: save more money, exercise, and stay in touch.
」「其实我能理解那些在封城之前逃出去的人，人性本身都是自私的。
"" I can understand that for those who fled before the closure of the city, humanity itself is selfish.
在一个不确定的环境下，人们的第一想法就是逃离，想在更大的空间里求活命。
In an uncertain environment, people's first thought is to escape and live in a larger space.
我不会这样做，我的家就在这儿，我的父母和整个家族都在这儿，我必须跟他们一起面对一切事情。
I wouldn't do that. My home is right here, my parents and the whole family are here, and I have to face everything with them.
再给我一次选择，我也一定还会留下来。
Give me another choice, and I'll stay.
」「昨天夜里武汉打雷了，下了冰雹和大雪，活到这么大，我还是第一次在武汉看到下这么大的雪。
"" Wuhan last night thunder, hail and snow, to live to such a large, I was the first time I saw such a big snow in Wuhan.
」Max 这样说。
"said Max.
