文/陶短房短短不到一个月里，“钻石公主”号邮轮上的确诊病例从“1”变成“634”，并付出了两条生命的代价。
In less than a month, the number of confirmed cases on board the MV Princess Diamond has changed from "one" to "634," at the cost of two lives.
停靠横滨大黑码头时，“钻石公主”号共有乘客2666人，船员及乘务员1045人，总计3711人，即便确诊人数不再增加，这也意味着这条船上平均每6人就有1人确诊，如此高密度，实在是令人瞠目结舌。
At Yokohama Black Wharf, the Diamond Princess had 2,666 passengers and 1,045 crew members and crew, or 3,711. Even if the number of people diagnosed does not increase, it means that on average one in six people on the ship is diagnosed.
对于此次日本官方的应对，许多国家都提出严肃批评，英国广播公司（BBC）直接使用了“隔离检疫失败”的断语。
Many countries have made serious criticisms of Japan's official response, with the BBC directly using the phrase "quarantine failure."
那么，对此次突发性公共卫生事件，日方的应对到底错在哪里？第一，是否“接管”，犹豫不决。
So, to this sudden public health event, what is the fault of Japan's response? First, whether to "take over", hesitant.
根据日本有关法律，船籍为英国、船东（嘉年华邮轮公司）注册地在美国迈阿密的“钻石公主”号，日本是有权不允许其进港，从而“甩手不管”的，事实上仅比“钻石公主”号晚到一步的“威士特丹”号邮轮就被日本（当然还有其他国家和地区）拒之门外，最终在海上徘徊至13日才被柬埔寨接纳。
According to Japanese law, the RMS Diamond Princess, whose registry is British and whose owner (Carnival Cruise) has its registered office in Miami, has the right to deny access to the US ship. Indeed, just one step later than the Princess of Diamonds, the ship was rejected by Japan and, of course, other countries and regions before finally being accepted by Cambodia on the 13th.
但“钻石公主”号自2014年起经常选择以日本横滨为母港，也是第一艘选择日本港口为母港的顶级豪华邮轮，对日本旅游经济、国家品牌形象都作出过重大贡献，船上有许多日本船员、乘客，且这条船还是在日本建造的（三菱重工）。
However, since 2014, the Princess of Diamonds has often chosen Yokohama, Japan, as its home port and the first luxury liner to choose a Japanese port as its home port, contributing significantly to Japan's tourism economy and national brand image, with many Japanese crew members and passengers on board, and the ship was built in Japan (Mitsubishi Heavy Industries).
在这种情况下，日方一方面碍于情面“准入”，另一方面又唯恐疫情在日本本土蔓延，采取了“让船进港但不让人上岸”的折中做法。
In such a situation, Japan, on the one hand, impeded "access" to the situation and, on the other hand, fearing the spread of the epidemic in Japan itself, adopted the compromise of "letting ships in but not disembarking them."
在隔离情形被外籍乘客不断曝光、来自四面八方责难声四起后，日本外务省、厚生劳动省一些官员曾以“我们本来没义务接管、接管本身就是本着人道主义精神”为自己辩护，殊不知“既接管、又管不好”本身，就已铸成大错。
The Japanese Foreign Ministry and some officials of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare have defended themselves by saying that "we were under no obligation to take over or take over in the spirit of humanitarianism" after the isolation was repeatedly exposed by foreign passengers and criticism from all sides.
第二，从检验到隔离破绽百出。
Second, it is flawed from inspection to isolation.
先说检验。
First come, first served.
最初三天仅检验了208例，此后耗费了整整两周时间才大体完成对全部乘员的检验，这导致此后一系列错误判断、决策，以及由此带来的严重后果。
Only 208 cases were examined during the first three days, and it took two full weeks for the entire crew to be substantially completed, leading to a series of misjudgments, decisions and serious consequences.
再说“隔离”。
And "isolation."
在中国大陆疫情之严峻形势已初步明朗的2月5日，日本厚生劳动省不仅采取了极富争议的“邮轮封闭式隔离”，且这个“封闭”是“对外不对内”，即乘员除非确诊不得登陆，“外人”也很难登船，但船上这近4000名乘员的“隔离”却十分疏松，仅有明显症状者才被安排单独隔离居住，其他人则仍可在船上走动、相互串联，被公认为“疫情传播重要漏洞”的中央空调始终未关闭，甚至“重点隔离”者的饮食，也由尚不确定是否感染的船员负责。
On Feb. 5, the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Labour not only adopted the controversial "closed quarantine" of the cruise ship, but also "closed" it was "not internal," meaning that the crew was not allowed to land or board the ship.
不仅如此，数千人的防护设备，包括防护口罩、手套等迟迟不能发放到位。
In addition, thousands of people's protective equipment, including face masks, gloves, etc. have been slow to arrive.
正如一些观察家所指出的，此次新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情和SARS、MERS等“同族”疫情最大的区别，一是传播能力极强，但轻症率高，二是无症状感染现象突出，三是感染自愈后再感染的现象较多。
As some observers have pointed out, the biggest difference between the new coronavirus pneumonia and the SARS and MERS outbreak is that there is a strong transmission capacity, but a high incidence of mild illness, two is the phenomenon of asymptomatic infection, and three is the infection since the recovery of the more re-infection phenomenon.
这在一定程度上，可以归咎为“被疫情打了个措手不及”。
To some extent, this can be attributed to "being caught off guard by the outbreak."
而日方的一系列错误应对，却人为在10多天内将密闭的“钻石公主”号，变成了一个“病毒培养皿”，令这艘邮轮不幸成为湖北以外疫情最密集、交叉反复感染现象最突出的范例。
But the Japanese side of a series of mistakes, but in more than 10 days will be closed "Princess Diamond" into a "Petri dish," the ship unfortunately become the most concentrated, cross-infection outside Hubei the most prominent example.
第三，日本既迟迟不允许别国插手，自己又无力担当，且在应对过程中表现出许多不专业之处，如厚生劳动省团队成员曾在操作过程中用手套擦汗，并在擦汗过程中摘口罩复戴，又如所谓“分区隔离”，实际上安全区和非安全区，不过是同一个空间的两扇门而已。
Third, Japan has been slow to allow other countries to step in, and has been unable to do so on its own, and has shown many unprofessionalism in its response, such as members of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare sweating with gloves during operations and wearing masks during sweating, and the so-called "zoning separation," which is nothing more than two doors in the same space.
这些做法施诸“钻石公主”号这个人员拥挤的密闭区间，无疑加剧了疫情交叉、反复感染的危险性。
These practices in the "Princess Diamond" this crowded closed zone, no doubt exacerbated the risk of cross-infection, re-infection.
第四，文过饰非、讳疾忌医，结果欲盖弥彰。
Fourth, the dress-up, the taboo medicine, the result wants to cover up.
当“钻石公主”号上乘员的糟糕、危险处境逐渐曝光，各方面不满和批评纷至沓来之初，日本多个职能部门的官员习惯性用“我们的团队很辛苦、很尽责”加以反驳。
As the ill-fated and dangerous situation of the crew of the Princess Diamond came to light, and a barrage of discontent and criticism began to pour in, officials from various functional departments in Japan habitually dismissed it as "our team worked hard and conscientiously."
日本内阁官房长官菅义伟曾表示，“2月5日以来都严格要求船组员采取必要防止感染措施”，“日本已尽力采取避免疫情扩大对策”。
Japan's chief cabinet secretary, Naoto Kan, has said: "Since February 5, the ship's crew have been strictly required to take necessary measures to prevent infection," and "Japan has done its best to take measures to avoid an epidemic."
当曾多次应对重大疫情、在国际间享有盛誉的传染病学专家、神户大学传染病内科教授岩田健太郎设法登船考察，并在2月19日发布视频，揭露“钻石公主”号防疫工作“漏洞之大让自己平生第一次感到害怕”时，此次邮轮疫情一线应对总负责、厚生劳动省副大臣桥本岳却在翌日连发十几条推特加以辩白——富有讽刺意味的是，前述“形同虚设的‘分区隔离’”事实，恰是在这位副大臣为辩白而发的视频中，被细心的各国观众“逮个正着”的。
When Shigeru Iwata, an internationally acclaimed infectious diseases expert who has repeatedly responded to major outbreaks, tried to board the ship and released a video on Feb. 19, revealing that the "Princess Diamond" epidemic was "so porous that he was scared for the first time." Ironically, Hashimoto, vice-minister of Health, Labour and Welfare, posted a dozen tweets the next day.
许多有心人都指出，日本官方之所以采取上述种种匪夷所思的应对策略、行为，是所谓“关心则乱”。
Many well-intentioned people point out that the Japanese authorities take the above-mentioned unthinkable response strategy, behavior, is so-called "concern is chaos."
近年来日本经济形势不佳，且日本产业严重依赖海外产业链配套，更严重依赖海外出口市场，突如其来的疫情已对此构成重创，如果疫情再弥漫日本本土，无异于雪上加霜。
Japan's economic woes in recent years, coupled with its heavy reliance on overseas industrial chains and a heavy reliance on overseas export markets, have been hard hit by the sudden outbreak, which would be worse if the epidemic spread to Japan itself.
正因如此，日方才对“钻石公主”号采取了如此令人费解的应对态度、措施，且迟迟既不愿让乘员登陆，又不希望“外人”登船插手，其真正考量，无非“把疫情封在这条船上”，以免殃及日本。
It is for this reason that Japan has adopted such an inexplicable attitude and measures against the Diamond Princess, and has been slow to disembark its crew and do not want outsiders to board the vessel. The real consideration is to "seal the epidemic on board" so as not to harm Japan.
不仅如此，2020年东京奥运会在即，日本政府、执政党和首要人物在这届奥运会上“押注”巨大，一旦奥运会因疫情而不得不推迟甚至易地举办，对他们而言显然是“不可承受之重”。
Moreover, in the run-up to the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan's government, ruling party, and leading figures are betting that, should the Games have to be postponed or even changed places because of the outbreak of the disease, it would clearly be "unbearable."
然而就在这种“错位”思维下，“钻石公主”号上的疫情被一误再误，终于让方方面面都面临一个极为尴尬、似乎所有人都是输家的结果：日本为这条船付出了许多，却不仅收获批评和抱怨，也仍有可能达不到如此选择的初衷——避免本土大范围疫情传播、保护经济、确保东京奥运会“一切照常”。
However, in this "misplaced" thinking, the "Diamond Princess" epidemic was repeatedly misplaced, finally exposing everyone to a highly embarrassing, seemingly loser-like outcome: Japan has paid much for the ship, but is likely to miss the point of choice - avoiding widespread indigenous epidemics, protecting the economy, and ensuring "business as usual" for the Tokyo Olympics.
有消息称，于2月19日后被允许登陆的、无症状日本乘员，均系自由搭乘各种社会车辆离去，而如前所述，此次疫情最大特点之一，就是无症状感染者比例很大，且潜伏期较长，但愿此举不是又一个新的错误，不至于造成更严重的后果。
It has been reported that asymptomatic Japanese crew members who were allowed to land after 19 February are free to leave in various social vehicles and, as mentioned earlier, one of the greatest features of the epidemic is the high proportion of asymptomatic infections and their long latency, which hopefully is not yet another new error with more serious consequences.
