2020年注定不平凡。
The year 2020 is destined to be extraordinary.
武汉封城、公众场所关闭、复工日期不断推迟......疫情让武汉人的生活被迫减速甚至停滞，而一批又一批的医护人员和志愿者逆行奔赴战场。
Wuhan sealed the city, public places closed, the date of resumption of work is constantly postponed... Wuhan people's lives have been forced to slow down or even stagnation, and groups of medical personnel and volunteers retrograde to the battlefield.
疫情期间，我们见证了无数感人的英雄故事，也看到武汉在众志成城的凝聚中，静候曙光。
During the epidemic, we witnessed countless moving heroic stories, and saw Wuhan in the unity of the city, waiting for the dawn.
能够亲身参与一线救护的人只是少数，但留在武汉的这900多万人里，还有更多人正在用自己的方式为武汉应援。
Only a few are able to personally participate in first-line care, but of the more than 9 million people who remain in Wuhan, many more are helping Wuhan in their own way.
在这个城市最黑暗的那几天里，一幅以雷神山、火神山和钟南山院士为主角、以抗击新冠病毒肺炎为主题的海报，让梁述光走进大家的视野。
In the darkest days of the city, a poster featuring the academicians Raytheon Hill, Mount Fire and Zhong Nan Shan, with the theme of fighting the New Crown Virus pneumonia, brought Liang Shuguang into the limelight.
他创作的“百毒不侵 诸邪莫近”海报，被共青团中央官微转发，在半小时内收获150万阅读和1000多条转发，这幅海报后来又被网友转载到虎扑论坛，引发8万多次阅读，一夜走红。
The poster, which was redistributed by the Communist Youth League Central Committee and was read by 1.5 million readers and more than 1,000 redisseminators in half an hour, was later reprinted by netizens at the Tiger Leap Forum, where it was read more than 80,000 times and made a hit overnight.
这幅海报最初被发布在他的个人微博上。
The poster was first posted on his personal microblog.
微博名叫“@搞事的光sir”，他也因此被网友亲切地称呼为光sir。
Weibo is called "light sir", and he is also affectionately called "light sir."
“网红”光sir背后，梁述光还有另一个日常身份——他是一名在线手绘设计讲师，学生喜欢喊他“小光老师”。
Behind the "net red" light, Liang also has another day-to-day status - he is a lecturer in online hand-drawn design, and students like to call him "Miss Light."
梁述光梁述光的人生轨迹和画画密不可分。
Liang Shu-liang described the life trajectory of light and painting inseparable.
小学时，他就对画画产生了浓厚的兴趣，报名参加了绘画艺术班，中学时代成为艺术生，大学也专修了艺术专业，毕业后成为一名美术老师。
When he was in elementary school, he became interested in drawing, enrolled in drawing art classes, became an art student in high school, majored in art and graduated as an art teacher.
可以说，学习和教授画画是梁述光从小到大对画画持续的热情使然。
It can be said that learning and teaching painting is Liang Shuguang from a small to a continuous passion for painting.
对于他来说，画画既是工作，也是所热爱的事情。
To him, drawing is a job as well as a love affair.
平时在微博上，梁述光经常发布自己的作品，绝大多数也与当时的热点相关。
Usually on Weibo, Liang Shuguang often publishes his own works, most of which are also related to the hot spots of the time.
提及这次海报的走红，他到现在仍觉得“没想到”。
He still doesn't think of the popularity of the poster.
梁述光以李兰娟院士和女性医护人员为主角创作的海报他告诉我们，三“山”合一的理念，来源于自己对于火神山、雷神山医院的关注和对走在医护人员最前方的领路人钟南山院士的钦佩与感激。
Liang Shu-kwong's poster, featuring Academicians Li Lan-juan and female medical staff, tells us that the concept of "mountain" unity comes from his concern for Mount Fire, Lei Shenshan Hospital and the admiration and gratitude of the leading traveler, Academician Zhong Nan Shan.
更让他觉得欣慰的是，得知许多一线的医护工作者也在关注和转发，这让他觉得自己的作品有了更多的意义。
He was also pleased to learn that many front-line health care workers were watching and forwarding, which gave him more meaning to his work.
梁述光是湖北黄石人，大学毕业后他选择定居武汉。
Liang Shuguang was a Hubei Huangshi man who chose to settle down in Wuhan after he graduated from university.
在武汉生活了十几年的他，对这座城市有着深厚的感情。
Having lived in Wuhan for more than ten years, he has deep feelings for the city.
他尤其怀念热闹甚至有些吵闹的武汉，想念人群拥挤、堵车的日子，那让他真实地体会到一座城市的繁荣。
He especially missed the busy and sometimes noisy Wuhan, miss the crowd, traffic congestion, that let him really feel a city's prosperity.
带着对武汉的深情，这段时间梁述光一直在坚持创作抗疫海报，希望尽自己的绵薄力量，为武汉应援。
With deep feeling to Wuhan, this time Liang Shuguang has been creating anti-epidemic posters, hope to do their own modest strength, for Wuhan.
作为一名设计讲师，他必须掌握多样的画风，适应不同学生的需求。
As a design instructor, he must master diverse styles of painting and adapt to the needs of different students.
在这次的抗疫海报中，除了“很燃很热血”的“百毒莫侵 诸邪莫近”之外，梁述光也创作了一些温暖的作品，带读者一同畅想疫情后的美好世界。
In this anti-epidemic poster, in addition to "very burning very hot blood," "do not invade all evil," Liang Shuguang also created some warm works, take readers to think of the post-epidemic world.
梁述光创作的“疫地恋”海报情人节当天，他发布了一组“疫地恋”的海报，内容是一对情侣在武汉的各大景点地标打卡，共同完成浪漫的事。
On Valentine's Day, Liang posted a poster of a pair of couples marking sites in Wuhan to work on romance.
借由这组海报，他希望能为那些因为疫情无法相见的情侣们带来一点温柔，希望疫情过去那天，大家都能去见想见的人，去到想去的地方。
With the posters, he hopes to bring a little tenderness to couples who cannot see each other because of the epidemic. Hopefully, on the day of the outbreak, everyone will be able to meet the people they want to meet and go where they want to go.
封闭在家的日子，梁述光有了更多的时间陪伴家人和孩子。
Sealed at home, Liang Shuguang has more time to spend with his family and children.
除了上课和画画，梁述光将大部分的精力都用在了孩子身上。
Besides taking classes and drawing pictures, Liang devoted most of his energy to his children.
疫情爆发前，梁述光和女儿在武汉街头他有两个女儿，大一点的两岁多，小一点的才六个多月。
Before the outbreak, Liang and his daughter had two daughters on the streets of Wuhan, more than two years older and more than six months younger.
因为疫情，原本开年要去上幼儿园的大女儿无法准时开学，小女儿也没办法去妇幼做体检。
Because of the outbreak, the first year of kindergarten to go to the eldest daughter can not start school on time, the youngest daughter can not go to mother and child for a medical examination.
孩子天性爱玩，但因为不能出门，孩子只能呆在家里玩玩具或者看书，这就需要梁述光和妻子花更多的心思，寻找一些新颖的方式吸引孩子的注意力，陪她们度过这段“非常时期”。
Children are playful by nature, but because they can't go out, they can only stay at home and play with toys or read books. This requires Liang and his wife to devote more attention to finding new ways to attract their children's attention and accompany them through these "extraordinary times."
他开始研究烹饪，烧烤、火锅、披萨、面包等等都尝试了，不能出门就自己在家做大餐。
He began to study cooking, barbecue, hot pot, pizza, bread and so on, and couldn't go out and cook his own dinner.
梁述光在家研究出的美食由于平时就是线上授课，梁述光的工作并没有受到太大影响。
Liang's work at home hasn't been much affected by the fact that he usually teaches online.
这段时间，他也一直在给学生讲述武汉的事情，同时也会邀请来自各个地方的同学分享感受。
During this time, he has also been talking to students about Wuhan, but will also invite students from all over the world to share their feelings.
通过这样的双向分享，学生们对武汉的状况有了更多真实的认知。
Through this two-way sharing, students have a more real understanding of the situation in Wuhan.
和绝大多数人一样，开始的时候，梁述光并没有特别重视这次疫情，直到封城和其它越来越严格的措施出台，才感知到情况危急。
Like most people, Liang did not pay much attention to the outbreak at first, until the siege and other increasingly stringent measures were put in place before he became aware of the crisis.
梁述光的居家工作照1月23号封城后，梁述光只去过一次超市，之后一直没有出门，在业主群团购物资。
After Liang's stay-at-home work was sealed on January 23, Liang went to the supermarket only once and has not gone out since then, buying goods in groups of owners.
梁述光在2016年，搬进了他现在所居住的北辰·当代优+。
Liang moved to Beicheng Contemporary You +, where he now lives, in 2016.
北辰 · 当代优+是光谷东最早的以年轻人为主题的运动社区，小区业主多是在光谷上班生活的年轻人。
Beicheng Contemporary You + is the earliest sports community with young people as the theme of the small district owners are mostly young people working and living in Guanggu.
平日里就有趣有脑的这群人，在面对疫情时，守望相助，力所能及地做一些志愿服务。
On weekdays, this group of people with interesting brains, in the face of the epidemic, keep watch for help, do as much as possible volunteer services.
较为安全的小区环境也让他有了更多的安全感。
He also feels more secure in a safer neighborhood.
疫情爆发后，小区物业除了每天定点定时消毒，还联合小区业主发起了蔬菜团购，为业主解决生活上的问题，同时为有困难的家庭提供帮助。
After the outbreak of the outbreak, in addition to the daily fixed point property disinfection, but also in association with small district owners launched a group of vegetables, owners to solve the problems in their lives, while providing assistance to families in need.
没有太多后顾之忧的他，在接下来的时间里，打算结合网友们的建议以及自己的灵感，继续创作抗疫海报，用自己的方式为武汉加油。
He did not worry too much, in the next time, with the advice of netizens and his own inspiration, continue to create anti-epidemic posters, their own way to fuel Wuhan.
疫情结束后，梁述光想带家人好好出去玩一趟，还想和朋友好好踢一场球，重新感受热闹的武汉。
After the epidemic ended, Liang just wanted to take his family out for a good trip. He wanted to kick a ball with his friends and feel the bustle of Wuhan again.
“我相信武汉经过这次阵痛后会越来越好，我相信我们武汉的力量，也相信中国的力量，一切都会好起来的。
"I believe Wuhan will get better and better after this pain. I believe in the strength of Wuhan and the strength of China, and everything will be fine.
