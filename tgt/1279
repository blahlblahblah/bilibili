新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎现已纳入《传染病防治法》规定的乙类传染病。
Pneumonia, a new coronavirus infection, is now included in the Class B infectious diseases stipulated in the Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Act.
由于是一种新型病毒，且传染性极强，疫情来势凶猛，初期难免引起人们的恐慌情绪。
As a new type of virus, and extremely infectious, the outbreak of fierce, the initial inevitable cause of panic.
但从已公布的疫情数据来看，新冠病毒肺炎发病数不如流感和乙肝等常见传染病，死亡率也处在一个相对较低的水平。
However, according to published epidemiological data, the incidence of Newcastle virus pneumonia is not as high as that of common infectious diseases such as influenza and hepatitis B, and mortality is at a relatively low level.
我国《传染病防治法》规定的传染病，目前包括甲乙丙三类。
Infectious diseases prescribed by the Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases currently include Category A, C and C.
按危害程度排序，甲类>乙类>丙类。
Rank by hazard class A & gt; B & gt; C
列入甲类传染病的鼠疫、霍乱，目前在国内已经基本绝迹。
Plague and cholera, which are classified as Class A infectious diseases, have been virtually eliminated in China.
乙类传染病中的非典型性肺炎（SARS），在2003年疫情扑灭之后，曾于2004年4～5月有过小范围复发，之后至今再未见报告。
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) among Class B infectious diseases, which was eradicated in 2003, suffered a mild recurrence in April-May 2004 and has not been reported since.
根据国家疾控部门定期公布的全国（不含香港、澳门特别行政区和台湾地区）法定传染病疫情报告，乙类和丙类传染病中，除新冠病毒肺炎外，目前发病数仍较多的有：流行性感冒、感染性腹泻、病毒性肝炎、肺结核、手足口病、梅毒、流行性腮腺炎、猩红热、淋病、艾滋病等。
According to the report on epidemic diseases prescribed by the state disease control authorities on a regular basis throughout the country (excluding Hong Kong, Macao Special Administrative Region and Taiwan), besides Newly Coronary Viral Pneumonia, epidemic influenza, infectious diarrhea, viral hepatitis, tuberculosis, hand-foot-mouth disease, syphilis, mumps, scarlet fever, gonorrhea and AIDS.
△ 来自国家卫健委官网从1月底发布的2019年12月疫情报告可以看到：发病数最多的是流行性感冒，达到1,199,771例，其次是其他感染性腹泻病（122,103例）、乙型肝炎（102,151例）；死亡人数最多的则是艾滋病（2,284例），其次是肺结核（230例）；病死率最高的是狂犬病，报告发病数19例，死亡人数30人（应包含12月之前发病的病例）。
The December 2019 epidemic report from the National Health Officers' Network, released at the end of January 2019, shows that the highest number of cases is influenza (1,199,771), followed by other infectious diarrhoeal diseases (122,103), hepatitis B (102,151), rabies with the highest fatality rate (19 reported cases and 30 deaths before December).
虽然2019年全年的传染病数据尚未公布，但从逐月累计数字，也可以看到过去1年报告传染病发病数和死亡数的大致情况（注：年度数据可能与累加数字存在一定偏差，以官方正式公布为准）。
Although data on infectious diseases for the whole of 2019 are not yet available, a summary of the number of reported cases and deaths of infectious diseases over the past year can also be seen from the cumulative figures for each month (Note: Annual data may deviate from the cumulative figure to the extent officially published).
拉长时间跨度，回顾2013-2019年的疫情数据，累计报告发病数最多的是手足口病（超过1500万例），死亡数最多的是艾滋病（10万余例）。
Looking back at the epidemic data for 2013-2019, the cumulative number of reported cases is hand, foot and mouth disease (more than 15 million) and the highest number of deaths is AIDS (more than 100,000).
2013-2019年的传染病疫情数据中，病死率最高的是狂犬病，发病数4,791例，死亡数4,523例。
Of the epidemiological data for 2013-2019, rabies was the most common cause of death, with 4,791 cases and 4,523 deaths.
鼠疫、人感染高致病性禽流感等烈性传染病，虽然近年来发病数极少，但是一旦发生疫情，病死率也极高。
Plague, human infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza and other powerful infectious diseases, although the number of cases in recent years is very small, but once the outbreak, the fatality rate is very high.
它们对于人类的威胁，始终没有完全解除。
The threat they pose to humanity has never been completely neutralized.
△ 病死率数据根据当期报告发病数和死亡数计算，仅供参考2013年至2019年，发病数最多的几种传染病中，每年报告的乙肝、肺结核、其他感染性腹泻发病数都比较平稳，约在100万上下；手足口病发病数波动相对较大，最低180余万，最高超过270万。
Mortality data are based on reported morbidity and mortality for the period 2013-2019 only. Among the most prevalent infectious diseases, the number of reported cases of hepatitis B, tuberculosis and other infectious diarrhea is stable at around 1 million each year. The number of cases of HFMD fluctuates relatively widely, ranging from over 1.8 million to over 2.7 million.
值得注意的是，过去几年，流行性感冒的发病数增长明显，尤其是2019年增幅最大，从2018年的70余万，陡增至350万。
It is worth noting that the number of influenza outbreaks has increased significantly over the past few years, in particular in 2019, where it rose steeply to 3.5 million from more than 700,000 in 2018.
尽管如此，这个数字可能仍然低于实际感染流感的病例数。
Nevertheless, this number may still be lower than the actual number of cases of influenza.
一般流感如无并发症，通常可以在一周内好转，病死率很低（2019年12个月累计报告流感350万例，死亡302例，病死率约为0.01%），而轻症流感与普通感冒相似，两三天即可恢复。
Normal flu usually improves within a week without complications, with a very low fatality rate (3.5 million influenza cases and 302 deaths reported in the 12 months of 2019, with a fatality rate of about 0.01 per cent), while mild influenza, similar to the common cold, can recover in two or three days.
也就是说，不是所有流感患者都会到医院诊治，难以纳入统计数字。
In other words, not all influenza patients go to hospitals, which is difficult to include in the statistics.
与流感相反，2013年至2019年，病死率最高的狂犬病，发病数和死亡数都呈逐年下降趋势。
In contrast to influenza, rabies, the disease with the highest fatality rate, morbidity and mortality declined year by year between 2013 and 2019.
人感染H7N9禽流感病死率也非常高。
Human mortality from H7N9 avian influenza is also very high.
过去几年中，发病数最多的是2017年，涉及安徽、四川、贵州、河北、北京等省市，全年共报告病例589例，死亡259例。
In the past few years, the largest number of cases occurred in 2017, involving provinces and municipalities such as Anhui, Sichuan, Guizhou, Hebei and Beijing, with 589 cases and 259 deaths reported in the course of the year.
但疫情很快得到控制，此后两年，报告发病数字均只有1到2例。
However, the outbreak was quickly brought under control, with only one to two cases reported in the following two years.
根据近年数据，病死率排在H7N9之后的另一大传染病是艾滋病。
According to recent data, another major infectious disease with a fatality rate after H7N9 is AIDS.
2013年至2019年，每年死亡人数都在万人以上，且发病数、死亡数都在逐年递增。
Between 2013 and 2019, the number of deaths per year was more than 10,000, and the number of morbidity and mortality was increasing year by year.
综上可见，高发病率、高死亡率的各类传染病，一直存在于我们周围。
As can be seen from the above, all kinds of infectious diseases with high morbidity and mortality have always existed around us.
有的发病数持续增长，比如流行性感冒和艾滋病；有的发病数逐年降低，比如狂犬病；有的始终保持在较高的发病水平，比如手足口病、病毒性肝炎（尤其是乙肝）、肺结核等。
Some cases continue to increase, such as influenza and AIDS; others decline year by year, such as rabies; and still others remain at higher levels, such as hand, foot and mouth disease, viral hepatitis (especially hepatitis B), tuberculosis, etc.
和这些传染病相比，新冠病毒肺炎是什么水平？从1月7日专家组初步判定“不明原因肺炎”的病原体为新型冠状病毒，往后推一个月，也就是截止到2月6日，全国累计报告新冠病毒肺炎确诊病例31,161例，累计死亡病例636例。
What is the level of New Coronavirus pneumonia compared to these infectious diseasesFrom January 7, the group of experts tentatively identified the pathogen "unidentified pneumonia" as the new coronavirus. By February 6, a cumulative total of 31,161 confirmed cases and 636 deaths had been reported nationwide.
把这一个月的发病数据，放到距离最近的2019年12月全国传染病疫情数据中做对比，新冠病毒肺炎一个月发病数约为乙肝（102,151例）的30%、肺结核（71,631例）的43.5%。
Compare this month's morbidity data to the most recent national epidemiological data for December 2019, when the incidence of HCV pneumonia was about 30 per cent of hepatitis B (102,151) and 43.5 per cent of tuberculosis (71,631).
不过，由于新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情在武汉集中爆发，来势凶猛，超出当地既有医疗资源的应对能力，统计数字可能无法完全覆盖实际发病人群。
However, due to the outbreak of the new coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, the intensity of the outbreak, beyond the local existing medical resources to respond, the statistics may not be able to fully cover the actual population.
比如，根据2月13日的通报，湖北省2月12日新增确诊病例将近1.5万，数倍于前日水平，就是因为放宽了确诊依据，只要患者在疑似病例基础上具有肺炎影像学特征，无需病毒核酸检测即可被列入“临床诊断病例”。
For example, nearly 15,000 new cases were confirmed on February 12 in Hubei Province, several times the previous day's level, just because the basis for the diagnosis had been relaxed and the patient did not need a viral nucleic acid test to be included in the "clinical diagnosis case," as long as the patient had imaging characteristics of pneumonia on the basis of a suspected case.
再来看病死率。
And look at the fatality rate.
此次新冠肺炎病死率，湖北地区>全国>非湖北地区。
New crown pneumonia mortality rate, Hubei region & gt; & gt; non-Hubei & gt;
原因不难理解，因为湖北疫情最重，超出了当地医疗资源承载能力，一部分患者未能得到有效的治疗。
The reason is not hard to understand, because Hubei epidemic is the most serious, exceeding the carrying capacity of local medical resources, some patients have not been effective treatment.
根据腾讯新闻的实时疫情追踪数据，可以明显看出这种差异。
According to Tencent News's real-time epidemiological tracking data, it is clear that this difference.
△ 来自腾讯新闻如上图所示，湖北地区的新冠肺炎病死率，在1月下旬有过一段超过5%的高点，之后逐渐回落，截至2月12日，已经不高于3%。
According to Tencent News, the death rate from pneumonia in Hubei province hit a peak of more than 5 percent in late January, then gradually fell back to no more than 3 percent as of February 12.
非湖北地区，病死率基本不超过0.5%。
The mortality rate in non-Hubei area was not more than 0.5%.
截至2月12日，全国新冠肺炎总体病死率约为2.2%。
As at 12 February, the national overall mortality rate for pneumonia was about 2.2 per cent.
钟南山院士曾表示，绝对来比的话，新冠肺炎的病死率比SARS还是低的（世卫组织报告给出的中国内地SARS致死率为7%）。
In absolute terms, the death rate for pneumonia is still lower than that for SARS (the WHO report puts the mortality rate for mainland China at 7%), said Dr. Zhong.
对比前文提到的其他传染病，新冠肺炎的病死率也远低于人感染禽流感、艾滋病等。
Compared with the other infectious diseases mentioned above, the mortality rate of new crown pneumonia is also far lower than that of human infected with avian influenza, AIDS, etc.
但正如钟南山院士所说，“我们不能因为它低就放松警惕”。
But as Academician Zhong Nan-shan said, "We should not let down our guard because it is low."
新冠肺炎疫情带来的影响有目共睹。
The impact of the New Crown Pneumonia epidemic is clear to all.
一鼓作气打赢这场防疫战，早日恢复正常工作和生活，是所有人的共同愿望。
It is the common desire of all to win the battle against epidemic and resume normal work and life at an early date.
