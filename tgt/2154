•疫情对于物流企业的影响，具体到细分业务上，整车快递目前的恢复率可能不到50%，零担的恢复率可能只有10%左右，形势都比较严峻；•物流赛道的投资逻辑就在于捕捉马太效应：找到有马太效应的领域，发现具备马太效应的要素，捕捉具备马太效应的公司；•融资难在去年就已经出现了，疫情只是一个筛选器，让很多本来商业模式没有那么好，或者说现金流模型没有那么好的企业提前出局；•活下来是第一要务，这是所有融资的策略。
:: The impact of the epidemic on logistics firms, particularly in the case of subdivisions, where the recovery rate is likely to be less than 50 per cent and zero-quilt recovery of only about 10 per cent; the logic of logistics is to capture the Matthew effect: find areas with Matthew effect, find elements with Matthew effect, capture companies with Matthew effect.
在经济比较差的时候，或者说疫情影响没有消退的时候，先活下来最重要，再加上小步快跑的策略，不恋战，以落袋为安作为第一优先级。
When the economy is poor, or the impact of the epidemic has not subsided, survival is the most important, coupled with the strategy of a quick trot, do not love war, to drop bags as Ann's first priority.
以下是郑烜乐在燃财经沙龙上的详细分享内容：物流行业整体恢复率不足50%疫情对国民经济造成了很大的冲击，具体到物流这个行业，需要从更底层的角度去做分析，这里面有四个维度。
The following is a detailed account of Zheng Hsuan-suan-lok's share at the Financial Salon: The overall recovery rate of the logistics industry is less than 50%, which has a great impact on the national economy.
首先从需求端来看，线下消费受到了很大限制。
First, on the demand side, offline consumption is severely constrained.
我们有一个做零售的客户，他昨天非常高兴地跟我说，他们当天的销售额终于达到了春节前的25%，可见线下消费受到的冲击之大。
We have a retail client who was very pleased to tell me yesterday that their sales had finally reached 25% of their pre-Spring Festival sales that day, and that offline consumption had been hit hard.
与之相对应的是，线上的电商和外卖等到家服务的需求变得越来越强劲，但是由于现在国内线下消费还是占整个大消费市场的主体，所以需求的整体下降，对于物流行业来说也是一个比较大的负面因素。
On the other hand, the demand for on-line and take-out waits for home-based services is becoming stronger, but since offline consumption still dominates the overall consumer market, the overall decline in demand is also a relatively large negative factor for the logistics industry.
第二个维度是供给端。
The second dimension is the supply side.
实体经济的复工率比较低，到现在为止只有50%-60%。
The rate of return to work in the real economy is relatively low, with only 50-60 per cent so far.
前段时间工厂停工、物流停运，导致整个生产资料短缺，但是这些企业的固定开销都比较大，中小企业的现金流压力非常大，如果说在三月份之内疫情还是不能得到有效的控制，那么中小企业的生存处境可能会比较危险。
Some time ago, the shutdown of factories and logistics, resulting in a shortage of the whole means of production, but these enterprises are relatively large fixed costs, small and medium-sized enterprises cash flow pressure is very large, if not effective control of the epidemic in March, then the survival of small and medium-sized enterprises may be more dangerous.
但中小企业是物流领域非常关键的上下游参与者，所以可能也会对物流行业造成一定的冲击。
But small and medium-sized enterprises are very critical players in the logistics field upstream and downstream, so it may also cause a certain impact on the logistics industry.
第三个维度是生产要素层面。
The third dimension is the factor of production dimension.
物流司机的复工率目前还处在低位，重卡司机的复工率甚至不到40%。
Return-to-work rates for logistics drivers are still low, with heavy truck drivers returning to work at less than 40 per cent.
园区集散的产能也只有60%左右的水平，所以我觉得整个物流行业目前的复工状态是比较慢的。
Park distribution capacity is only about 60% of the level, so I think the logistics industry as a whole is relatively slow to return to work.
加上各个区域的封城封路现象，生产要素层面还是会有较大的影响。
In addition to the closure of the various regions, factors of production will still have a greater impact.
最后从宏观政策层面看，国家出台的一些控制疫情的政策，也对物流行业造成一定的影响。
Finally, from the macro-policy level, the country issued a number of policies to control the epidemic, the logistics industry has a certain impact.
后续我相信随着这些政策的逐渐解除，以及货币政策和财政政策的推进，包括用社保来支持中小企业，上述现象会进一步得到缓解。
I believe this will be further mitigated by the gradual unwinding of these policies and the promotion of monetary and fiscal policies, including the use of social security to support small and medium-sized enterprises.
疫情对于物流企业的影响，具体到细分业务上，整车快递目前的恢复率可能不到50%，然后零担的恢复率可能只有10%左右，形势都比较严峻。
In terms of the impact of the epidemic on logistics companies, the current recovery rate for whole-vehicle couriers may be less than 50 per cent, followed by a zero-cwt. recovery rate of only about 10 per cent, the situation is more serious.
因为外卖和电商的配送量在疫情期间大幅度增加，同城配送反而成了刚需，加上区域之间交通的限制较小，所以受影响不大。
Because the distribution of takeaway and electricity businesses has increased dramatically during the epidemic, distribution with cities has become just as much as needed, and with less regional traffic restrictions, it has been less affected.
但同时，由于线下餐饮行业的负面影响比较严重，所以冷链型的同城配送恢复率仍然比较低。
But at the same time, because the negative impact of the offline catering industry is more serious, so cold chain distribution recovery rate of the same city is still low.
Q1本来就是整个物流行业的淡季，这会一定程度上缓冲疫情对于物流企业业务的影响，但平均来看，还是会占到全年业绩的20%左右，所以如果疫情持续到四、五月份才能完全控制住的话，将会对物流企业的业绩有进一步的影响。
Q1 is already a slow season for the logistics industry, which will cushion the impact of the epidemic on the logistics business, but on average it will account for about 20% of the full year, so it will have a further impact on the performance of logistics companies if the epidemic is not fully contained until April and May.
物流企业赖以生存的实体经济，包括上下游中小企业的倒闭，会对物流行业造成二次冲击。
Logistics enterprises rely on the survival of the real economy, including the closure of SMEs upstream and downstream, will cause a secondary impact on the logistics industry.
加上国际疫情的蔓延对出口造成的不利影响，也会反过来影响航运和集卡等行业的发展。
Combined with the adverse impact of the international epidemic on exports, this will in turn affect the development of industries such as shipping and card-gathering.
疫情对于物流企业财务状况的影响，首先是业务体量不能覆盖租金和人工，还有资产折旧等等高额固定成本，这在Q1将会是一个比较普遍的现象，也会造成全年盈利能力的下滑。
The impact of the epidemic on the financial situation of logistics enterprises, first of all, the volume of business can not cover rent and labor, but also high fixed costs such as asset depreciation, this will be a relatively common phenomenon in Q1, and will cause a decline in profitability throughout the year.
一旦上游企业现金流压力加大，将会导致物流企业的回款能力变差，加上高额的固定支出，会使得企业面临比较大的现金流压力。
Once the upstream enterprise cash flow pressure increases, will cause the logistics enterprise to pay back the ability to be bad, together with the high fixed expenditure, will cause the enterprise to face the relatively big cash flow pressure.
但是整体来看，疫情始终只是一个短期因素，不管到几月，疫情总会过去，长期来看依然危中有机。
But the epidemic as a whole is always a short-term factor, and no matter how many months it takes, the epidemic will be over and organic in the long run.
伴随着电商渗透率的提高，大家的需求更旺盛，这些生活方式和生活习惯的变化，也会对行业产生较为长期的积极影响。
These lifestyle and lifestyle changes will also have a longer-term positive impact on the industry as a result of increased penetration of electricity.
除了物流快递行业以外，其他的物流领域目前来看还是比较分散的。
In addition to the logistics express industry, other logistics areas are still relatively scattered.
中小制造和商贸企业的倒闭也会影响中小物流企业的经营，而物流的大多数领域本身也越来越具备马太效应，我认为疫情也会加速行业洗牌，促进行业的整合。
The collapse of small and medium-sized manufacturing and trading enterprises will also affect the operation of small and medium-sized logistics enterprises, and most areas of logistics itself increasingly have Matthew effect, I think the epidemic will also speed up the industry shuffle, promote industry integration.
对于一些目前在领跑的公司来说反而是一次比较大的机会。
It's a big opportunity for some of the companies that are currently leading the way.
马太效应加剧绝大多数创业公司可能会死在A/B轮从物流行业过去几年的投融资数据也可以看出一些趋势。
Matthew effect aggravates most startups and most startups could die in A / B's investment and financing data from the logistics industry over the past few years as well.
2018年是物流行业相对来说发展较快的年份，到2019年，交易数量比2018年一下子下降了34%，交易金额下降了56%。
The year 2018 was a relatively fast-growing year for the logistics industry, with the number of transactions falling by 34 per cent in 2019 compared with 2018, and the value of transactions falling by 56 per cent.
资金向头部企业聚集的趋势也越来越明显。
The trend of capital accumulation to head enterprises is also becoming more and more obvious.
从2017年到2019年，行业估值和体量TOP10企业的融资额占整个行业当年融资总额的比例分别是68%、78%和94%，体现了比较强的马太效应，强者恒强。
From 2017 to 2019, industry valuation and volume TOP 10 enterprises as a proportion of the total financing of the industry as a proportion of the total financing is 68%, 78% and 94%, respectively, reflecting a stronger Matthew effect, the strong strong.
我们也能看到A轮的融资事件在2019年大幅度降低，轮次转化率也在快速下降。
We can also see that the financing of round A was significantly reduced in 2019, and the round conversion rate is also declining rapidly.
A轮到B轮的融资转化率，从2018年的28%降到2019年的21%，B轮到C轮的转化率，从2018年的48%降到了2019年的35%。
The financing conversion rate of A to B fell from 28 per cent in 2018 to 21 per cent in 2019, and that of B to C round fell from 48 per cent in 2018 to 35 per cent in 2019.
这充分说明了融资正在变得越来越难，特别是对于非头部的物流企业来说，随着资金快速向头部企业聚集，头部企业的融资难度相对降低，且绝大多数的创业公司可能会死在A轮或者B轮，因为融资的竞争越来越激烈。
This suggests that financing is becoming increasingly difficult, especially for non-head logistics firms, where it is relatively difficult to raise capital as the capital rapidly converges on the head, and most start-ups are likely to die in round A or round B because of growing competition for financing.
物流赛道的投资逻辑就在于捕捉马太效应：找到有马太效应的领域，发现具备马太效应的要素，捕捉具备马太效应的公司。
The logic for investing in logistics is to capture the Matthew effect: find areas with Matthew effect, discover elements with Matthew effect, and capture companies with Matthew effect.
过去几年上市的物流公司，要么是有网络效应和规模效应，像四通一达等快递行业；要么就是可以靠资金去构建马太效应，比如说一些船运领域的公司。
Logistics companies that have gone public in the past few years have either network effects and economies of scale, such as the express-delivery industry, or they can rely on money to build the Matthew effect, say, some shipping companies.
现在新兴起的这波物流公司，更多是平台型的公司，这样的公司可以用更低的资本投入、更快的速度来构建马太效应。
Now the emerging wave of logistics companies is more of a platform-type company that can build the Matthew effect with lower capital investment and faster speeds.
在互联网出现之前，同城货运的公司其实是不具备马太效应的，会受到司机跑单等因素影响。
Before the advent of the Internet, with the city freight company is not in fact Matthew effect, will be affected by the driver run single factors.
但因为技术的变革，出现了移动互联网、移动支付，涌现了像货拉拉、满帮这样的公司，他们通过技术迭代在行业里面快速建立马太效应，发展成为平台型的公司。
But technological change has led to the emergence of mobile Internet, mobile payments, and companies like Lala, Manchu, which have rapidly built up a Matthew effect in the industry through technical iterations to become a platform company.
投资人其实是会关注马太效应形成的速度，比如不同的行业和不同的公司，他们运力网络的覆盖速度以及跨区的复制速度其实是不一样的。
Investors tend to focus on the speed at which the Matthew effect develops, for example, across industries and companies, the speed of their capacity networks, and the speed with which they replicate across regions.
马太效应形成过程中的效率和风险，也是投资人看重的，所以他们在关注增长的同时也会更关注现金流，关注交易模型以及未来毛利的提升空间。
The efficiency and risks associated with the Matthew effect are also important to investors, so they focus on growth while also focusing on cash flow, trading models and the future growth of Maori.
疫情中逆势拿到TS有两大秘诀疫情其实只是一个放大器，而不是转折点。
There are two secrets to getting TS in an epidemic. The epidemic is actually an amplifier, not a turning point.
疫情之下，企业融资是很难，但是融资难在去年就已经出现了，疫情只是一个筛选器，让很多本来商业模式没有那么好，或者说现金流模型没有那么好的企业提前出局。
Corporate financing is hard to come by in the face of the epidemic, but funding was hard to come by last year, and the epidemic was a filter that made many otherwise business models less good, or that cash-flow models weren't as good as the firms out early.
这也是为什么平台型的公司更容易跑出来——他们在疫情期间比起非平台型的公司有更好的现金流模型，他们的成本结构、资金使用效率也会更高，他们也可以在疫情期间更高效地去调度资源、整合运力。
That is why it is easier for platform-based companies to come out - they have better cash-flow models during an epidemic than non-platform companies, they have better cost structures, more efficient use of funds, and they can more efficiently marshal resources and integrate capacity during an epidemic.
光源最近一共向疫区组织捐赠了超过30万件医疗物资，在这个过程中，在武汉市内很多地方的交付，很多都是通过货拉拉的司机来完成的，平台模式在此时确实会有一些优势，能够在任何时候提供一定的运力保障。
The light source recently donated more than 300,000 pieces of medical supplies to organizations in affected areas. In the process, many deliveries in many parts of Wuhan city are made by cargo-handling drivers.
在此，我也想特别感谢一下我们的好朋友聚盟，此次光源爱心援助行动中他们也在运力上给我们提供了不少帮助。
At this point, I would also like to express special thanks to our good friends who have also helped us with our transportation capacity in the light of the Heart Aid Operation.
另外，我们认为信息化和智能化程度高的企业，在疫情之后，恢复速度会更快。
In addition, we believe that the informatization and intelligent degree of enterprises, in the aftermath of the epidemic, recovery will be faster.
长期来看，我们比较看好技术替代人工去优化调度效率，降低人工成本。
In the long run, we prefer to substitute technology for manual scheduling to optimize efficiency and reduce labor costs.
比如我们服务的客户鸭嘴兽，他们也是用技术驱动去提升码头集卡行业的运力整合效率。
For example, we serve customers platypus, they are also using technology-driven to improve the efficiency of the terminal card industry's capacity integration.
模式轻，现金流健康的公司，他们受疫情的影响是比较小的，比如货拉拉、乐卡车联，他们用平台模式整合运营了1000多条零担的线路，固定成本低，资金风险也会相对较低。
Light, cash-flow companies are less affected by the epidemic, such as truckers and truckers, which use platform models to integrate and operate more than 1,000 zero-cwt. lines, with low fixed costs and relatively low financial risk.
和一些物流企业交流之后，我在此分享一些大多数公司比较行之有效的经营措施。
After some exchanges with some logistics enterprises, I would like to share some of the most effective business practices.
从业务的角度来看，现金为王，尽可能做精细化运营，以经营安全作为第一优先级，不要去增加重资金投入的新业务尝试和资本性的投资。
From the business point of view, cash for Wang, as far as possible to do fine operation, safety as the first priority, do not increase heavy investment in new business attempts and capital investment.
其次，调整渠道策略和销售体系，特别是对于一些偏大B的物流公司，可以设计一些回款激励，加快现金流周转。
Secondly, adjust the channel strategy and sales system, especially for some large B logistics companies, can design some cash flow incentives to speed up cash flow.
另外，用变动成本尽可能多的替代固定成本，例如人力的灵活化和运力的灵活化运用。
In addition, replace fixed costs as much as possible with variable costs, such as human mobility and mobility flexibility.
最后讲到光源的老本行——融资。
Finally, the light source of the bank - financing.
总体来说，战略上要积极，战术上要严谨。
On the whole, be strategic and tactically rigorous.
战略上乐观是因为投资的反弹往往会快于负面因素的结束，投资人本质上都是要投好公司的，只要这个好公司在这个过程中还是能够生存且能够跑出来，那投资人看到疫情洗牌导致更大的马太效应以后，投资行为还是会继续。
The reason for strategic optimism is that the rebound in investment tends to outpace the end of the negative. Investors essentially want to do well in the company, so long as the good company can survive and escape in the process, then investors will see the epidemic shuffle lead to greater Matthew effect, investment behavior will continue.
但是相应的就需要创始人在战术上严阵以待，这里有12个字口诀——合理预期、科学计划、周密执行。
But there is a corresponding need for the founders to be tactically ready. Here are 12 Tips - Reasonable Expectation, Scientific Planning, Careful Implementation.
活下来是第一要务，这是所有融资的策略。
Survival is the number one priority. It's all about financing.
在经济比较差的时候，或者说疫情影响没有消退的时候，先活下来最重要，再加上小步快跑的策略，不恋战，以落袋为安作为第一优先级。
When the economy is poor, or the impact of the epidemic has not subsided, survival is the most important, coupled with the strategy of a quick trot, do not love war, to drop bags as Ann's first priority.
然后在融资的过程中，有两个关键的方法论，第一，长期和短期的影响要素拆开。
Then in the process of financing, there are two key methodologies, first, the long-term and short-term impact factors are disconnected.
可以跟投资人讲清楚哪些负面表现是短期影响，而哪些正面因素才是长期影响。
It is possible to explain to investors what the short-term effects are and what the positive ones are.
这样可以快速把投资人拉到理性看待自己业务的状态中。
This can quickly draw investors into a rational view of their business state.
比如我们最近有一个客户，我们帮他在疫情中拿到了TS，他的业务受疫情影响还是比较明显的。
For example, we recently had a customer, we helped him in the outbreak of TS, his business affected by the epidemic is still relatively obvious.
但是我们截取了1月22号之前的经营数据，跟投资人分析：第一，截至1月22号的数据，表现都非常好；第二，这个业务受疫情的影响肯定只是一个短期的影响，疫情结束后，因为它是一个刚需品类，肯定会很快恢复。
But we intercepted pre-January 22 data and analyzed them with investors. First, the numbers as of January 22 are doing very well. Second, the impact of the epidemic is certainly only a short-term effect, as it is a new requirement category that is sure to recover soon after the outbreak.
投资人看到数据也比较认同，后来又参考了2003年SARS结束以后这个行业的恢复情况，最终做出投资的决策。
Investors saw the data also more agree, and then referred to the end of SARS in 2003 after the recovery of the industry, and finally made investment decisions.
第二个方法论是分清整体和局部，挖掘好整体和局部的不同价值。
The second methodology is to distinguish between the whole and the part and to excavate the different values of the whole and the part.
我们另外一个客户也是刚拿到了TS，他们的业务也受到了很大影响。
Another of our customers has just received TS and their business has been greatly affected.
但我们看到他所有没有被关闭的业务网点，恢复情况很理想；有部分开的比较早的业务网点，比去年同期涨了百分之二三十。
But we saw that all of his non-closed branches were doing well, and some of his older branches were up 2. 30 percent over the same period last year.
投资人看到这个局部的优势变化以后，认为只要疫情恢复，公司整体业务还是会很快起来，于是决定投资。
Investors saw this local advantage change, as long as the epidemic recovery, the company as a whole business will soon rise, so decided to invest.
要想把融资从一件可能看起来像碰运气的事，变成一件科学的事，就要科学管理所有的交易时间节点。
The scientific management of all trading time nodes is required to turn financing from what might seem like a chance into a scientific affair.
在每一个节点到来之前，做好充分的后备方案。
Make adequate backup plans before each node arrives.
企业家也应该保持开放的心态，积极向资本市场沟通企业受到的影响以及恢复的情况，这样更有利于建立投资者的信心。
Entrepreneurs should also keep an open mind and actively communicate to the capital market the impact of the enterprise and the state of recovery, which is more conducive to building investor confidence.
同时创业者要在条款和估值方面尽可能更加开放，以合适、平衡和速度作为交易的第一原则。
At the same time, entrepreneurs need to be as open as possible in terms of terms and valuation, with suitability, balance and speed as the first principles of the transaction.
企业应备好九个月的粮草我在去年感受到整个资本市场完成融资的时间差不多是六个半月左右，今年这个时间有可能还会进一步延长，所以我认为今年企业的生死线应该是九个月。
I felt last year that the whole capital market was about six-and-a-half months old, and it is likely to get even longer this year, so I think the life-and-death line for businesses this year should be nine months.
也就是说，企业一定要备好九个月的粮草，如果不够九个月，就应当马上开始融资。
In other words, enterprises must be ready to prepare nine months of food and grass, if not nine months, should immediately start financing.
如果一个物流公司正在进行融资，他的业务也受到了疫情的影响，怎么去把这个正在进行的融资，尽可能好地推动下去？主要有四个要点。
If a logistics company is raising capital and his business is affected by the epidemic, how can this ongoing financing be put to the best possible use? There are four main points.
第一是充分沟通。
The first is adequate communication.
一定要及时跟重点投资人同步公司业务的变化，充分的沟通会比让投资处在不确定性的恐慌中要好很多。
Be sure to keep pace with changes in the company's business with key investors in a timely manner. Adequate communication is much better than leaving the investment in a panic of uncertainty.
一定要区分清楚短期和长期的影响、整体和局部的关系。
It is important to distinguish between short-term and long-term impacts, overall and local relationships.
了解投资者的核心顾虑，了解内部决策人的动态，在这个关键的时间节点，去管理好他们对于业绩复苏的预期。
Understand the core concerns of investors, understand the dynamics of internal decision-makers, and manage their expectations of recovery at this critical point in time.
第二是战略纵深。
The second is strategic depth.
对于企业家来说，一定要更多地去和参与交易的投资人进行谈判，特别是可以领投的投资人。
For entrepreneurs, it is important to negotiate more with the investors involved in the transaction, especially those who can take the lead.
同时跟老股东去做进一步的沟通，去商讨包括先借笔钱的可能性。
At the same time, follow up with established shareholders to discuss the possibility of including the possibility of borrowing money in advance.
第三是科学管理资金。
Third is the scientific management of funds.
一定要去明确每一个时间点，比如说投资人答应什么时候给TS，什么时候准备出SPA等。
Be sure to identify each point in time, such as when the investor agrees to give TS, when to prepare for SPA, etc.
如果这些时间点miss掉的话，那一定要启动后备方案。
If you miss these points in time, be sure to launch a backup plan.
另外要把现金流管理好，尽可能在谈判期间省着花，去保持谈判能力。
In addition to good cash flow management, as much as possible during the negotiations to save money to maintain the ability to negotiate.
此外还要小步快跑，去降低投资的决策门槛——可以把一个比较大的融资拆成几轮来融，或者是把一个比较大的融资估值涨幅拆成几步来实现，都会更好地推动交易。
There are also small steps to lower the investment decision-making threshold - either by unbundling a larger amount of financing into several rounds, or by taking a few steps to achieve a larger valuation gain, all of which would boost trading.
最后是灵活谈判。
Finally, flexible negotiations.
一定要在业务下行保护的基础上，跟投资人去评估业绩复苏的节奏，以此来做估值的调整，或者是把投资变成可转债，会使投资决策更灵活一些。
It is important to assess the pace of recovery with investors on the basis of downwards protection, either to adjust valuations or to convert investments into convertible bonds, making investment decisions more flexible.
疫情必然对物流行业有冲击，但就像2003年SARS之后，出现了阿里和腾讯这样非常厉害的公司一样，我也相信这次疫情，会让物流领域的一些组织能力强、模式又好的公司跑出来。
The epidemic is bound to have an impact on the logistics industry, but like the SARS epidemic in 2003, which saw the emergence of companies as strong as Ali and Tencent, I believe the outbreak will see the emergence of well-organized and well-modeled companies in the logistics sector.
我们只有拭目以待，希望看到更多的、用创新来对抗疫情的伟大公司。
We have only to wait and see more of the great companies that have used innovation to fight the epidemic.
对话郑烜乐：2020更看好工业自动化、产业互联网、新人群燃财经：疫情带给光源资本FA业务本身的影响有多大？疫情期间的FA业务有何特点？资金的供求两端分别是什么状况？郑烜乐：拆解成两个方面来看。
Dialogue Zheng Hsuan-suan Le: 2020, more optimistic about industrial automation, industrial Internet, new people burning finance: What is the impact of the epidemic on light source capital FA business itself? What are the characteristics of FA business during the epidemic?
短期来看肯定有影响，因为我们的客户会受一些影响，比如说线下消费、供应链、工业领域、物流领域的客户，业务上还是会有些影响。
In the short term, it certainly matters, because our customers are affected by things like offline consumption, supply chains, industry, logistics, and so on.
但好在这只是局部，有些行业，比如泛文娱、在线教育、电商这些领域，刚好迎来爆发式的增长，一来一去有对冲作用。
Fortunately, this is only part of the story. Some industries, such as pan-entertainment, online education, and telecoms, are just beginning to experience explosive growth and hedge their bets.
另外，大家现在都用Zoom来开会，投资人现场尽调的节奏也变慢了，第三方机构进场的速度没有那么快，但是总体上我们的业务还是在正常推进的。
In addition, we now use Zoom for meetings, investors slow down the pace of the scene, third-party agencies do not enter the scene so fast, but overall our business is advancing normally.
光源是服务于头部企业的精品投行，所以影响其实还是比较小的。
The light source is the boutique investment bank that serves in the head enterprise, so the influence is actually quite small.
相对来说，头部企业能更好的在疫情中冲出来，抗风险能力会更强，抓住红利的机会也更多，长期来看对我们可能也是好事。
In relative terms, head companies are better able to emerge from the epidemic, are more risk-resistant, have better chances of capturing dividends, and may be good for us in the long run.
燃财经：最近，无接触的概念比较火，你认为这会加速物流行业与人工智能的结合吗？投资人可以重点关注什么类型的项目？郑烜乐：无接触在疫情期间是比较热的话题，但是能否成为一个长期趋势，还需要观察。
Flaming Finance: Recently, the concept of no contact is more popular. Do you think it will accelerate the integration of logistics industry with artificial intelligence? What kind of projects can investors focus on? Zheng Hsuan-lok: No contact is a hot topic during the epidemic, but it remains to be seen whether it will become a long-term trend.
我们之前也一直在关注物流领域跟机器人和自动驾驶的结合，但离大规模商业化，在终端这块还需要一定时间。
We've been looking at logistics in combination with robotics and auto-driving, but it's going to take some time before it's commercialized on a large scale.
然后在集散环节，生产环节，可能已经有一些大规模的应用了，这些可能也是投资人目前应该会去重点关注的领域。
Then in the distribution chain, the production chain, there may already be a number of large-scale applications, these may also be investors should focus on the current area.
燃财经：2020年，你认为创业者和投资人应该重点关注哪些新趋势、新方向？郑烜乐：中国现在其实制造业到了一个转折点，中国想保持制造业大国的地位，在往人工智能和工业4.0方向转型，这是一个非常关键的时间点。
In 2020, what new trends and directions do you think entrepreneurs and investors should focus on? Hsuan-Hsuan-lol: China is now really at a turning point in its manufacturing sector.
我们也会去积极布局一些工业自动化、工业智能化的公司。
We will also actively layout some industrial automation, industrial intelligence companies.
其次是产业互联网，这依然是我们高度关注的领域，还是有很多产业的效率可以被进一步提升。
Second is the industrial Internet, which remains an area of great concern to us, or there are many industries where efficiency can be further improved.
最后我们还是坚定看好新人群、新消费的一些趋势。
Finally, we are firmly optimistic about the new crowd, some trends in new consumption.
长期主义+利他主义、赌异类才能有逆势的投资成绩燃财经：2019年光源资本收获颇丰，服务的项目都取得了新的突破，比如趣头条、B站、快手、每日优鲜、哈啰出行、快看漫画、少年得到、毒APP（已更名“得物”）、Soul，在创投行业整体低迷的背景下，光源资本为什么还能有这么好的业务表现？你们做对了哪些事情？郑烜乐：做的最对的事情其实就是服务于1%顶尖企业家，然后让最好的企业家去拿到最好的投资人的钱，形成一个正向循环，同时给我们带来好的口碑，再来吸引更多的好项目。
Long-term + altruism, gambling on heterogeneity can have counter-trend investment results fuel finance: 2019 light capital harvest, service projects have made new breakthroughs, such as fun headlines, B station, fast hands, daily good, Hello travel, quick to see caricatures, juvenile access, APP (renamed "get"), Soul, to attract more good projects.
具体到能力拆解方面，我们将研究放在很重要的位置，不少项目都是我们通过研究去挖掘出来的——不管是年轻人群也好，下沉市场、新消费趋势也好，产业互联网趋势也好。
In terms of capacity dismantling, we have put research in a very important position, and many of the projects we have studied have been developed - whether by young people, sinking markets, new consumer trends, or industry Internet trends.
总体上我们会特别看重几类机会，第一类是大的赛道里面强者恒强，第一名持续增长，快手就是很典型的公司。
Generally speaking, we will pay special attention to several kinds of opportunities. The first is the strong man in the big track, the first one is growing continuously, the quick hand is a typical company.
第二，这个赛道里面本来有一个第一名，但我通过研究发现这个行业的很多关键成功要素，第二、三名更具备，或者是新进入者更具备，那我们就去帮他们成为这个第一名，这套方法论也诞生了很多公司，比如哈啰单车。
Second, there was supposed to be a number one in the circuit, but my research found that many of the key success factors in the industry, second and third were better, or new entrants were better, so we helped them become the first, and this methodology led to a lot of companies, such as Hello Bicycles.
第三，我们也非常擅长去发现一些大家本来没有那么关注的赛道，比如得物APP，潮鞋潮服领域，本来很多人觉得是一个小品类，我们做了研究以后觉得会成为一个大赛道。
Third, we are also very good at discovering some of the things that people don't care about, such as the things APP, Tide Shoe Tide, which many people thought was a small category, and we did research and thought it would be a big road.
我们也很注重资源，不管是BAT还是政府相关的资源，通过这些资源帮助企业家。
We also focus on resources, whether BAT or government-related, to help entrepreneurs through these resources.
我们不仅定位于帮企业做融资，我们也希望帮企业做战略规划、并购整合和产业布局。
We not only aim to help enterprises do financing, we also hope to help enterprises do strategic planning, merger and acquisition integration and industrial layout.
燃财经：2014年底，你在望京创立了光源资本，过去5年多，创投环境可谓风云变幻，作为一个创业者你有哪些感悟和收获？郑烜乐：我在创业方面的感悟主要有两点。
Flaming Finance: At the end of 2014, you founded Light Source Capital in Wangjing. Over the past five years, the venture capital environment has been changing.
第一是长期主义。
The first is permanence.
很多人认为FA是一个离钱比较近的行业。
Many see the FA as an industry closer to money.
在这个基础之上，是不是以长期的心态来做事，是不是以和企业家一起来创造长期的价值为导向来做事，就显得非常重要。
On this basis, it is very important to do things with a long-term mentality and with entrepreneurs to create long-term value-oriented things.
第二是利他主义，因为我们这个行业其实是企业家成功才是真正的成功，一定要利他，一定要以跟企业家去创造10年、20年的长期价值，作为长期的导向。
The second is altruism, because our industry is actually successful entrepreneurs is true success, must altruistic, must be with entrepreneurs to create 10, 20 years of long-term value, as a long-term orientation.
燃财经：能聊聊你和货拉拉创始人兼CEO周胜馥之间的故事吗？为什么看好货拉拉？郑烜乐：我在2014年到2017年之间，聊了几乎所有的同城货运行业里面的公司。
Flaming Finance: Can you tell me the story between you and Zhou Shengfu, the founder and CEO of Lala? Why do you think Lala? Hsuan-Le Cheng: Between 2014 and 2017, I talked about almost all the companies in the freight industry in the same city.
当时我曾经认为这个行业是一个伪行业，因为所有的模式都是补贴，司机在里面刷单，不能把用户的行为固化到平台上。
At the time, I thought the industry was a bogus business, because all the models were subsidies, where drivers simply swiped their tickets and could not solidify the user's behavior on the platform.
直到我碰到了周总，他跟我讲了他的经营理念和商业模式，让我看到原来这个行业还是能够把优质的运力给筛选出来的。
Until I met Chou, he told me his business philosophy and business model, let me see that the industry is still able to select high-quality capacity.
他确实是一个在这个领域非常不同的创业者。
He is really a very different entrepreneur in this field.
之前我聊过所有的founder几乎都是做物流出身的，只有他是非物流行业，还有一些比较有趣的经历。
Before I talked about all the Founders are almost all logistics origin, only he is non-logistics industry, there are some more interesting experience.
我当时就觉得如果一个行业里边所有人都是一类人，而他们都没做成，然后这个时候有一个异类出现了，他把这事做成的概率，至少是非常值得去赌的。
I felt that if all the people in an industry were in the same category and they didn't make it, and then there was a different kind of person coming along, and the probability of him making it, at least, was well worth gambling on.
