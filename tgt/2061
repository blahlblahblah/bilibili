杨飞霖站在人来人往的纽约时代广场，戴着口罩，手里举着一块牌子，上面写着一句她自己想出来的标语“Mask+Asian≠Virus（口罩+亚裔≠病毒）”，牌子的另一面则写着“STOP THIS NEW ANGLE OF RACISM（停止新形式的种族歧视）”。
Yang was standing in the crowded Times Square in New York City, wearing a mask and holding a sign that read "Mask + Asian monkey in Virus" on one side and "STOP THIS NEW ANGLE OF RACISM" on the other.
随着疫情扩散，尽管各国都在为控制疫情作出努力，但仍有一些地方出现了针对海外华人的偏见和污名化，甚至引发了暴力事件，“有些受害者的经历真的很吓人”。
As the epidemic spreads, and despite efforts to contain it, there are still pockets of prejudice and stigma against overseas Chinese, and even violence, "some of the victims have really been terrible."

杨飞霖没办法对出现的歧视事件视而不见，她想出了反歧视标语，把标语印在T恤上，穿着T恤到纽约地铁里面贴写有标语的海报，去时代广场给路人做宣传，向路人免费发放口罩，并给他们拍摄肖像，“我们这一代人是历史的见证者，很多人没有做出回应和努力，我不能批判别人，只有自己多做一点，去填补一些漠视”。
She came up with anti-discrimination banners, T-shirts on T-shirts, posters with banners on the New York subway, free masks for passers-by, and portraits of them. "Our generation is a witness to history.

前不久，杨飞霖戴着口罩准备上纽约地铁，一名男子在她身后高声说“她戴着口罩”，她扭头问他：“我这还有多余的口罩，你要不要？”飞霖的一位亚裔朋友也有类似的遭遇，他在去俱乐部玩的时候受到了语言攻击，“你有病毒，请滚回你的国家”。
A short time ago, Yang Feilin, wearing a mask, was preparing to go to the New York subway when a man yelled behind her, "She's wearing a mask." She turned to him and asked, "Do you want this extra mask?
在纽约住了三年，这个“开明、文化多元、整体上很安全的地方”，第一次让飞霖感觉到不安全。
After living in New York for three years, "an enlightened, culturally diverse, and generally safe place," Feilin felt unsafe for the first time.
△杨飞霖设计的标语T恤模特照飞霖意识到这和中西方迥然不同的“口罩文化”有一定关系。
Yang Feilin's slogan T-shirt model Zhang Feilin realizes that this has something to do with the disparate culture of masks in the West and China.
疫情当前，与国内倡导全民戴口罩以保护自己、防止传染他人不同，在法国和英国，卫生部门明确不鼓励没有病状的人戴口罩。
Unlike in France and the United Kingdom, where the health authorities explicitly discourage people from wearing masks if they are not sick, the epidemic is currently different from promoting the use of face masks for all at home.
而在纽约，地铁里每天都有很多穿着奇装异服的人，大家很少对别人另眼相待，但在这个时间点，戴口罩还是会十分引人注意。
In New York, there are a lot of people in fancy clothes every day on the subway. People rarely look at each other differently, but at this point in time, wearing masks can be very attractive.
“人们对未知新病毒的恐惧愈深、愈缺乏了解，遇到亚洲面孔戴着口罩出街，越会有相关的联想与恐惧，但恐惧是一回事，做出带有敌意的反应就是另一回事了，如果说以这个事情为借口针对亚洲人或者针对中国人，那就是种族歧视”。
"The more people fear the unknown new virus, the less they understand it, and the more associated associations and fears there are when Asian faces walk out of the streets wearing masks. But fear is one thing, and hostile reactions are another, and if it is used as a pretext to target Asians or Chinese, it is racial discrimination.
△时代广场，截取于杨飞霖的纪录片国内疫情刚开始传开时，杨飞霖在纽约看到不少亚洲人戴口罩，但发生了一些因病毒恐惧亚裔遭受暴力等事件后，戴口罩的人就少了。
Times Square, Interception of Yang Feilin Just as the epidemic began to spread in China, Mr Yang saw many Asians wearing masks in New York City, but there were fewer people wearing masks after the virus feared violence against Asians.
随着疫情蔓延，又正值流感季，这样的现象让她觉得这件事情很不正常。
As the outbreak spread, and as the flu season unfolded, it seemed to her that this was not normal.
“戴口罩应该是每个人的自由选择”，亚裔不应该因为戴口罩而背负“病毒”的恶名，更不应该因为恐怖被污名化而放弃佩戴口罩。
"Wearing masks should be everyone's choice." Asians should not be stigmatized as "viruses" by wearing masks, much less should they give up wearing masks because of the stigma attached to them.
△纽约地铁站里贴上反歧视的标语海报有了在纽约地铁的亲身经历后，杨飞霖又看到有几家外国媒体在头版头条直接使用“中国病毒”“黄祸”等词汇，她当时就想到“口罩+亚裔≠病毒”这句标语，她把标语印在T恤上，又打印了八九十张小海报，海报上加了一句“停止新形式的种族歧视”，当天晚上就穿着T恤到地铁里去贴海报了。
After spending time on the New York Metro, Yang saw several foreign media using words such as "Chinese virus" and "yellow" directly in the front page. She thought of the slogan "Mask + Asian Capulet virus." She printed the slogan on her T-shirt and printed eighty-nine posters with the slogan "Stop New Forms of Racial Discrimination."
△ 杨飞霖在纽约地铁贴海报杨飞霖选择了学校附近的团结广场站、布鲁克林大桥站、市政厅站和唐人街等几个站点，“贴的时候很小心，尽量保持低调，因为不想惹麻烦”。
Yang Feilin posted posters on the New York Metro. Yang Feilin chose sites near the school such as Solidarity Square Station, Brooklyn Bridge Station, City Hall Station and Chinatown.
贴海报的时候，她看到一对男女在聊天，等她贴完，那个男的念了一遍标语，然后笑了一下。
As she put up the poster, she saw a man and a woman talking. When she finished, the man read the slogan and smiled.
杨飞霖转头看了他一眼，只见他掏出手机给那幅海报拍了张照片。
Yang Feilin looked at him and saw him take a picture of the poster with his mobile phone.
杨飞霖有点受到触动，“他是什么样的想法无所谓，只要海报上的内容有传递出去就达到效果了”。
Yang Feilin was a little touched. "It doesn't matter what he thinks, as long as the content of the poster is passed on."
△杨飞霖与朋友在时代广场举牌。

杨飞霖的几个朋友听说这件事后，和她要来海报，要帮助她一起宣传。
Several friends of Yang Feilin heard about the incident, and she will come to the poster, to help her propaganda together.
她想到，不然干脆把标语放大印在牌子上，到时代广场去做活动。
Otherwise, she thought, she would magnify the sign and go to Times Square.
第一次去时代广场做活动的时候，她戴着口罩，站在高台上，举着写有标语的大牌子，每当有人停下来，她就向他们解释，让他们知道有这样一个错误的观念：有一些不怀好意的人用病毒作为借口，来做一些歧视亚裔的事情。
On her first trip to Times Square, she wore a mask, stood on a high platform and carried a large sign with a sign. Whenever anyone stopped, she explained to them that there was a misconception that some malicious people were using the virus as a pretext to do something that discriminated against Asians.
她还会送他们一个口罩，为他们拍下佩戴口罩的肖像照片，并将整个过程拍摄成纪录片。
She would also give them a mask, take portraits of them wearing masks, and film the process as a documentary.

三个小时里，有二十余人停下来与她对话，给出的都是善意。
In three hours, more than twenty people stopped to talk to her, all in good faith.
一位中东裔的大哥跟飞霖说，他非常理解她的心情，因为911的时候，也有很多人只是因为他是中东人的长相，就会歧视他。
A Middle Eastern elder brother told Feilin that he understood her feelings very much because there were many people who discriminated against him on 9 / 11 simply because he was Middle Eastern.
一位来自明尼苏达州的游客表示：“这样的行为艺术可以让更多的人注意到这个问题，从而帮助消除华人在公共场合戴口罩被污名化的问题。
A visitor from Minnesota said: "The art of acting like this can help bring the problem to the attention of more people and help eliminate the stigmatization of Chinese wearing face masks in public.
”还有人停下来问飞霖的感受，她坦言“感到不公平、愤怒，还有一点点害怕”，路人安慰她不要担心，并肯定了她的勇气。
Others stopped to ask FeiLin how she felt, saying "I feel unfair, angry and a little scared," and passers-by reassured her not to worry and affirmed her courage.

这次她碰到了一群中国志愿者，十几个人一起做“我不是病毒”的free hug（免费拥抱）活动，效果非常好。
This time, she met a group of Chinese volunteers, a dozen of whom worked together on the "I'm not a virus" free hug, which worked very well.
他们主动上来拥抱飞霖，表示理解并感激飞霖做出的一切努力。
They came forward to embrace FeiLin and express their understanding and gratitude for all his efforts.
经过的不少路人也表达了类似的看法，有人要求和飞霖合影，说喜欢她的标语，也有人要走了飞霖的Twitter和Instagram账号，想要帮她一起宣传这件事。
Many passers-by have expressed similar views, with some asking to take a photo with FeiLin, saying they liked her slogan, and others going through Lin's Twitter and Instagram accounts to help her publicize the event.
△ 美国媒体采访视频截图在时代广场，飞霖接受了一家美国媒体的采访，采访视频传到网上，很多人都看到了，一些同样为疫情奔走的海外中国人群体后来碰到飞霖，都问她，“你就是时代广场那个女孩？”飞霖感慨，“有些东西很难量化，但是有意识地去做一些事情的话，还是会看到效果的”。
"Some things are hard to quantify, but if you do something consciously, you can still see the effect," Feilin told a US media interview in Times Square. Many people saw that some overseas Chinese groups who were also fighting for the outbreak later met Feilin and asked her, "You are that girl in Times Square?"
△ 摄影：杨飞霖来美国读研之前，杨飞霖曾在媒体工作多年，她现在仍会以“媒体人”的标准要求自己，“我既然有这个途径，就一定要去表达，就像记者会去讲故事，摄影师则是举起相机”。
After working in the media for many years before she came to the US for postgraduate studies, Yang Feilin still demands herself as a "media man." "Since I have this way, I will definitely express it, just like a journalist going to tell a story and a photographer lifting a camera."

近距离的黑白色肖像，镜头用的是广角镜头，整个视觉都聚焦在口罩上面。

她特意在拍时放大口罩，是想表达在错误的联想当中，大家并没有看到口罩后面那些活生生的个体，而只是看到口罩，因此放大了对病毒的恐惧。
She purposely enlarged her mask to show the wrong association, not seeing the real person behind the mask, but only seeing the mask, thus amplifying the fear of the virus.
她想记录下每一个个体，希望真正看到这些年龄不同、身份不同、种族不同的人，处在这个当下，在口罩后面藏着什么样摄的情绪。
She wants to keep a record of everyone, of all ages, of different identities, of different races, of what kind of emotion is hiding behind a mask at this moment.
△ 摄影：杨飞霖杨飞霖曾在学校医务室遇到一位中国女生，她戴着口罩，还戴着护目镜，整个人看上去忧心忡忡，她们自然而然地聊起来疫情的事情，女生说很希望情况可以快点好转。

在时代广场，有很多外国人听了飞霖对“口罩+亚裔≠病毒”的解释后，选择戴上口罩，表明支持中国人、支持正在受害的患者、支持抗击疫情的立场。
In Times Square, many foreigners listened to Mr Flynn's explanation of "mask + Asian monkey virus" and chose to wear masks to show their support for the Chinese, for the sufferers who were suffering, and for the fight against the epidemic.
△摄影：杨飞霖对于杨飞霖自己来说，口罩背后则是内疚和不安，“国籍是我身份认同的一部分，国家出了这样的事情，我一开始有点内疚。
"Nationality is part of my identity. I felt a little guilty at first when something like this happened to the country.
在这边，每天出去都要面对不掌握相同信息的人们，有人疑惑、好奇，有人的眼神并不善意，当你去理解别人为什么这么想你的时候，你的心理是很复杂的。
On this side, you go out every day to face people who do not have the same information, some people wonder, some people do not look good, when you understand why others think you, your mind is very complex.
”拍摄这些肖像对于飞霖而言，也是试图从被拍摄对象的身上，反射她自己体会到的一些感想跟信息。
"The portraits, too, are an attempt to reflect some of the feelings and messages that Feilin experienced from the subject.
△摄影：杨飞霖杨飞霖最后拍出来的肖像一共有四五十张，她打算把它们全部打印出来，希望有机会能得到集中的展示，“当外国人开始理解如果你生活在一个环境里面，你周围的人每天必须戴口罩出门，他们或许会多一点共情”。
"When foreigners come to understand that if you live in an environment where people around you have to wear masks every day, they may have a little more empathy," she says.

摄影：杨飞霖杨飞霖刚刚完成“慈善喜剧之夜”的拍摄，牵头的是两位在纽约打拼的中国女生，她们是喜剧脱口秀演员，为了筹集善款并全部捐赠到国内，她们请来喜剧演员在切尔西音乐厅表演。

杨飞霖跟着两位女生走了四五条街发放演出宣传单，在咖啡馆休息的时候，其中一位女生说，她最近每天早上起来看新闻都会哭一会儿，看到武汉的小孩吃不上饭、看到有人和家人隔离两地，觉得很多无辜的人在为别人的过失承担后果。
One of the girls said she recently cried every morning when she got up to watch the news. Seeing the children in Wuhan deprived of food and separated from their families, she felt that many innocent people were bearing the consequences of other people's mistakes.
△杨飞霖与一位路人交流。

杨飞霖也受类似的“过度共情”的困扰，家人让她“正能量”一点，多关注正面信息，但她却觉得“负面信息不等于负能量”，“整个国家要正能量的话，就是要相信我们能战胜疫情。
Yang Feilin suffers from a similar "over-empathy," with her family giving her a bit of "positive energy" and more attention to positive information, but she feels that "negative messages do not equal negative energy" and that "the whole country needs positive energy to believe that we can overcome the epidemic."
但是，如果你不去关注个体的故事，是没有办法去关心一个整体的。
But if you don't focus on the individual story, there is no way to care about the whole.
有的人全家都感染了，有的人在国外受到了歧视，不管个体的故事有多悲伤，他们的故事才是最重要的。
Some are infected, others are discriminated against abroad, and no matter how sad an individual's story may be, their story matters.
”杨飞霖最近打算整理一下被疫情打乱的生活和学业，不过她仍然会继续去记录和表达她所看到的一切。
Yang recently plans to take stock of her life and her studies, which have been disrupted by the epidemic, but she will continue to record and express what she sees.
她近期要去采访学校里的一个女生，在和学校只有一街之隔的地方，大街上的一位陌生男性对她说了侮辱性的词汇，还打了她的头，飞霖觉得有必要为这件事情发声、反击，她在facebook上面写道：“We individual Chinese, have nothing to be ashamed of.（作为中国人中的一员，我们没有任何好羞愧）”。
"We have nothing to be ashamed of as one of the Chinese people," Feilin wrote on Facebook, "We have nothing to be ashamed of as a member of the Chinese community."
