1月23日，武汉“封城”。
January 23, Wuhan "closed the city."
早期轻视疫情，防护不力，让这座城市错失了阻击病毒的先机。
Early contempt for the epidemic and inadequate protection allowed the city to miss the opportunity to stop the virus.
之后病人一度或难以确诊，或一床难求，一些人因此错过了最佳的救治时机。
Some people miss out on the best treatment when a patient is at first or difficult to diagnose, or when a bed is difficult to get.
据湖北省卫健委通报，截至2月22日24时，武汉市累计报告新冠肺炎确诊病例46201例，死亡1856例；累计治愈出院8171例。
As of 2400 hours on February 22, a total of 46,201 confirmed cases and 1,856 deaths had been reported in Wuhan city, and 8,171 cases had been cured, Hubei Wei Health Commission reported.
这座新冠肺炎的始发地，没有哪个时刻像现在这样，千万居民同呼吸共命运。
At no point in the history of the new crown pneumonia has millions of people breathed the same breath.
护士杨柳每天都很害怕，但依旧坚持在一线，直至自己被感染；菜贩刘娟二十多天没有洗澡，终于治愈卸下一身的焦虑；失独家庭李华夫妇给彼此打气，希望更多的人能够挺过去……他们无论什么身份，都是“新冠肺炎”的患者，是千千万万的普通人。
Yang Liu, a nurse, was frightened every day, but she was still on the line until she was infected. Liu Juan, a vegetable peddler, had not bathed for more than 20 days and finally healed her anxiety.
一个月来，他们用倔强与坚持在跟病毒抗争，付出了爱和痛，甚至生命。
For a month, they fought the virus with stubbornness and persistence, paying for love and pain and even life.
“封城”后的医护保障车队。

发病与“封城”56岁的刘娟和丈夫陈彪在武汉市江岸区西马路菜市场摆摊卖菜30余年，每天从早上6点到晚上7点，主要卖些菌子、蘑菇、青菜。
Liu Juan, 56, and her husband, Chen Biao, have been selling vegetables at the Halluca Market on the west side of the Jiangan district of Wuhan for more than 30 years.
1月12日下午，摊铺来了一位老客户买菜，蒙着头，裹得严严实实，像得了重感冒一样。
On the afternoon of January 12, an old client came to the shop, covered his head, and wrapped up as if he had a bad cold.
此后，刘娟开始头痛、全身酸痛。
Since then, Liu Juan began to have a headache, aching whole body.
此时，武汉已出现多起“不明肺炎”，但多数人觉得离自己很远。
At this time, Wuhan has appeared a number of "unknown pneumonia," but most people feel very far from themselves.
据《长江日报》报道，武汉市疾病预防控制中心主任、主任医师李刚1月19日接受媒体采访时表示，“新冠病毒传染力不强，不排除有限人传人的可能，但持续人传人的风险较低……疫情是可防可控的。
"The new crown virus is not highly contagious and does not rule out the possibility of a limited human-to-human transmission, but the risk of continuous human-to-human transmission is low... The outbreak is preventable and controllable," Li Gang, director of the Wuhan city center for disease prevention and control, told reporters
”截至1月20日，武汉卫健委的通报中显示，“密切接触者中，没有发现相关病例”。
As of January 20, Wuhan Health Commission of the briefing showed that "close contacts, no relevant cases have been found."
时间回拨到2019年12月8日，一位来自武汉市华南海鲜市场的病人，因持续7天发热、咳嗽和呼吸困难入院，后来他成为武汉市卫健委1月11日通报的首例“不明肺炎”患者。
On December 8, 2019, a patient from Wuhan South China Seafood Market was hospitalized with fever, cough and breathing difficulties for seven days before becoming the first case of "unknown pneumonia" reported by Wuhan Health Commission on January 11.
五天后，这位病人的妻子也因同样的症状入院。
Five days later, the patient's wife was hospitalized with the same symptoms.
一直到1月1日，这个位于武汉闹市区，离汉口火车仅一公里的华南海鲜市场才关闭。
The South China seafood market, located in downtown Wuhan and only a kilometer from the Hankou train, was closed until January 1.
西马路菜市场离华南海鲜市场有四五公里，市场有三百多个摊位，是武汉市江岸区最大的菜场。
West Road from the South China seafood market is 45 kilometers, the market has more than 300 stalls, Wuhan is the largest vegetable market.
那时候，菜场里已有不少人生病了，但没有人想到是“传染病”，而且都不愿意说自己的病情。
At that time, many people in the vegetable field were sick, but no one thought of "infectious diseases" and did not want to talk about their illness.
刘彪也一样，别人问起他妻子，他就含糊说道，“不怎么样，过几天就好了。
Liu Biao was the same. When asked about his wife, he said vaguely, "No, just a few days later.
”刘娟去诊所吊了4天水，病情却一天比一天严重。
Liu Juan went to the clinic to hang water for four days, but her condition was getting worse every day.
1月17日，她烧到了37.9度，出现拉肚子、呼吸困难等症状。
On 17 January, she burned to 37.9 degrees, showing symptoms such as diarrhea and breathing difficulties.
陈彪看到妻子很难受，把摊铺一关，带着她去了武汉市第六医院。
Chen Biao saw his wife very afflictive, spread out a level, took her to Wuhan Sixth Hospital.
一进医院，护士叫他们戴口罩，并给他们每人发了一只。
As soon as they entered the hospital, the nurse told them to wear masks and gave each of them one.
陈彪不理解，觉得戴着口罩不舒服，一直不愿意戴。
Chen Biao did not understand, feel wearing masks uncomfortable, has been unwilling to wear.
那时，医院挤满了病人，医生都穿着刘娟从没见过的白色防护服，她跟丈夫说，“穿这个衣服像大熊猫一样”。
The hospital was full of patients and doctors were wearing white protective clothing Liu Juan had never seen before. She told her husband, "It looks like a panda."
他们挂号、查血，做完CT后，医生说她感染了一种新病毒，让他们去武汉市第五医院隔离。
They registered, blood checked, and after a CT scan, doctors said she had contracted a new virus and sent them to Wuhan's Fifth Hospital for isolation.
到了五医院，刘娟被诊断为社区获得性重症肺炎以及脓毒血症。
Liu Juan was diagnosed with community-acquired severe pneumonia and sepsis in five hospitals.
当天晚上，她整晚都在留观室打点滴。
That night, she spent the whole night in the observation room.
晚上，刘娟去上厕所时，突然昏倒在地上，被护士抬上了担架。
In the evening, Liu Juan went to the toilet, suddenly fainted on the ground, was carried on the stretcher by the nurse.
那时，五医院只剩重症监护室有病床，一天的费用要五千到一万元。
At the time, the intensive care unit was the only hospital with beds, costing between $5,000 and $10,000 a day.
陈彪对医生说，不管花多少钱也要把妻子治好。
Chen Biao told the doctor that no matter how much money he spent, his wife should be cured.
刘娟记得，迷迷糊糊之中，她被推进了重症监护室。
Liu Juan remembers, in a daze, she was pushed into intensive care.
医生用无创呼吸机给她吸氧，打点滴来抗病毒、抗感染、抗炎和营养支持。
The doctor used a non-invasive respirator to give her oxygen, drops of antiviral, anti-infection, anti-inflammatory and nutritional support.
其间，她还做了核酸检测为阳性，被确诊为“新冠肺炎”。
She also tested positive for nucleic acid and was diagnosed with "new crown pneumonia."
1月20日晚上，医生打电话给陈彪，说准备把刘娟转到金银潭医院集中治疗。
On the evening of January 20, the doctor called Chen Biao and said he was going to transfer Liu Juan to Gold and Silver Pool Hospital for intensive treatment.
陈彪问“她不是好一些了吗？为什么要转院？”医生说接到上面的指示，让转过去统一治疗，而且治病也不收钱了。
"Wasn't she any better? Why was she transferred to hospital?" The doctor said he had been instructed to refer him to unified treatment.
刘娟成为了收治免费后金银潭医院接收的第一批“新冠肺炎”患者。
Liu Juan became the first group of "New Crown Pneumonia" patients to be admitted to the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital for free.
陈彪给妻子送衣服过去时，已经快到凌晨了，几十台救护车都在马路上跑。
By the time Chen Biao sent his wife clothes, it was almost dawn and dozens of ambulances were running down the road.
他后来才知道，就在1月20日的晚上，国家卫健委高级别专家组组长钟南山称：“新冠肺炎”肯定存在人传人，有14名医务人员已经感染了。
Only later did he learn that on the night of January 20, Zhong Nan-shan, chairman of the high-level group of experts of the National Fitness and Health Commission, said: "There must be human-to-human transmission of Newcrown Pneumonia.
他建议没有特殊情况，不要去武汉，有感冒要到发热门诊就诊，要戴口罩。
He suggested that no special circumstances, do not go to Wuhan, there is a cold to go to the fever clinic, to wear masks.
生病前，刘娟和丈夫陈彪的合影。
Before falling ill Liu Juan and her husband Chen Biao took a group photo.
第二天，从外地的部队刚回武汉不久，李阳阳去药店买到了几只口罩，之后他又去超市买了一些年货。
The next day, shortly after returning to Wuhan, Li Yang went to the pharmacy to buy a few masks, after which he went to the supermarket to buy some new year's goods.
两天前，30岁的李阳阳因为有事，刚从异地的部队回到武汉。
Two days ago, 30-year-old Li Yang Yang, because of business, just returned to Wuhan from the troops.
他没有想到，接下来发生的疫情，成为了一场历史性的教训。
He did not expect that the ensuing outbreak would be a historic lesson.
1月21日，一家人提前在家里吃了年夜饭。
On January 21, the family had an early New Year's Eve meal at home.
第二天，武汉传出要“封城”，但很快又说是谣言。
The next day, Wuhan came out to "seal the city," but soon said it was rumor.
那时候，李阳阳发现武汉人变得谨慎又慌张，一方面认为疫情不严重，另一方面又敏感多疑。
At that time, Li Yang found Wuhan people became cautious and flustered, on the one hand, the epidemic is not serious, on the other hand, sensitive and suspicious.
事实上，“封城”的消息传出来后，一些人当晚就“逃离”了武汉，一些人到处询问、核实，犹豫要不要提早离开，还有一些人决定留下来。
In fact, when word of the city's closure spread, some fled Wuhan that night, some asking questions, checking, hesitating to leave early and others deciding to stay.
李阳阳回部队的火车票，很早就已经买好了。
Li Yangyang back to the army's train tickets, have been bought very early.
1月22日当天，他送妻子和小孩回了在黄冈武穴市的娘家。
On January 22, he sent his wife and children back to their mother's home in Wanggang cave.
晚上回到武汉后，他又去药店买口罩，抢到了店里最后一盒N95口罩，50个，19块8毛钱一个。
Back in Wuhan in the evening, he went to the drugstore to buy masks, seized the store's last box of N95 masks, 50, 19 yuan 88 cents a.
那时候，他还不知道什么是N95口罩，只觉得它很贵。
At the time, he didn't know what the N95 mask was. He thought it was expensive.
1月23日凌晨2点，武汉市政府宣布：23日10时开始“封城”。
January 23 2: 00 a.m., Wuhan city government announced: 23 at 10 a.m. "closed the city."
此后的1月26日，武汉市市长周先旺表示：武汉市有1100多万常住人口，户籍人口990多万，流动人口将近500万。
Later, on January 26, Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang said: Wuhan city has a resident population of more than 11 million, with a population of 9.9 million and a mobile population of nearly 5 million.
因春节和疫情因素，已经有500多万人离开了这座城市。
More than five million people have left the city because of the Spring Festival and the epidemic.
那天一早，下着小雨，车站机场人山人海，李阳阳跟着最后一批出城者离开了。
That morning, the light rain, the station airport sea of people, Li Yangyang followed the last group of people left the city.
到上午10点，武汉正式“封城”，公交、地铁、轮渡戛然而止；长途客运、机场、火车站全部暂时关闭。
By 10: 00 a.m., Wuhan officially "closed the city", bus, subway, ferry Cannes; long-distance passenger transport, airports, railway stations were temporarily closed.
截至当日24时，湖北省549例累计报告的新冠肺炎确诊病例中有495例来自武汉。
By 2400 hours on the same day, 495 of the 549 confirmed cases of newly reported pneumonia in Hubei Province had come from Wuhan.
急诊护士的伤痛武汉，别称“江城”，历史上被称为“九省通衢”，是中国内陆最大的水陆空交通枢纽中心。
Wuhan, also known as "Jiangcheng," has historically been called "thoroughfare of nine provinces," the largest inland waterway and air transportation hub in China.
因为错过了最好的防疫时期，病毒以悄然在人群中迅速蔓延，很快攻破了整个武汉市的防御。
Because missed the best epidemic prevention period, the virus quietly in the crowd spread rapidly, and quickly defeated the entire Wuhan City defense.
在武汉一家医院急诊上班的护士杨柳记得，1月10日，他们医院接诊了第一个发热病例，之后每天人数疯长，10个、30个、60个……不久，他们医院开设了发热门诊，但病人不愿意去发热门诊，害怕过去会交叉感染。
Yang Liu, a nurse at an emergency clinic in Wuhan, remembers the first case of fever at the hospital on January 10, and the numbers skyrocketed every day to 10, 30 and 60... Soon after, the hospital opened a fever clinic, but the patients were reluctant to go to the fever clinic fearing cross-infection in the past.
所以，一般患者过来后，会先到急诊科检查，病情严重的，再由急诊转到发热门诊。
Therefore, after the general patients come, will first come to the emergency department to check-up, serious illness, and then from the emergency to the fever clinic.
杨柳回忆，以前患者来打针，叽叽喳喳说个不停，如今每个人带着口罩，低着头，一片鸦雀无声。
Yang Liu recalled, patients came to the needle, chirp non-stop, now everyone wearing masks, bowed their heads, a total silence.
白天黑夜，急诊室都黑压压的，全是病人。
By day and night, the emergency room was dark and full of patients.
医生、护士连吃饭、上厕所都得挤时间；而马路上空空荡荡，进出医院的人要么开车，要么打车，要么走路回家。
Doctors and nurses have to squeeze in time to eat and use the restroom, and the streets are empty, with people driving, taking taxis or walking home.
武汉“封城”第一天，做市场推广的黄晓民6点钟下班，开车途经武汉协和、武汉同济等四家医院，发现路上车子很少，路边很多人打不到车。
Wuhan "closed the city" on the first day, do marketing Xiaomin 6 o'clock off work, driving through Wuhan Concorde, Wuhan Tongji and other four hospitals, found that the road cars, many people can not get a car.
到了晚上，他跟朋友商量，决定组队当志愿者司机，免费接送医护人员。
In the evening, he discussed with friends, decided to work as a volunteer team driver, free of charge to transport medical personnel.
他发了一条朋友圈，新建了一个微信群，群里人数很快达到400多，其中有300多名医护人员，86名志愿者司机。
He set up a circle of friends and a new microcosm, which soon reached more than 400 people, including more than 300 medical personnel and 86 volunteer drivers.
1月24日，除夕夜，一名护士在群里发了一条出行信息。
On January 24, New Year's Eve, a nurse posted a travel message in the group.
黄晓民打电话过去确定时间、地点，最后在武汉中心医院后湖院区接上了对方。
Huang Xiaomin telephoned to confirm the time and place, and finally in Wuhan central hospital back lake courtyard area met each other.
这是黄晓民接的第一单，那时候，他戴着泳帽、泳镜，口罩，“有点像蜘蛛侠”。
It was the first time Huang was in contact, wearing a swimming cap, goggles and mask, "a bit like Spiderman."
因为是第一次，他有些紧张，把车窗户全部都打开了，风“哗啦哗啦”地吹进来，车里的噪声很大，听不见对方说了什么。
For the first time, he was nervous and had his car windows open. The wind was blowing in so loud that he could not hear what the other person was saying.
到目的地时，护士要给他钱，黄晓民不要，说自己是志愿者。
When he arrived at his destination, the nurse wanted to give him money. Huang Xiaomin said he was a volunteer.
护士很感激，第二次带了几个一次性帽子、手套、口罩和一个防喷溅的面罩给他。
Thankfully, the nurse brought him a few disposable hats, gloves, a mask and a splash-proof mask for the second time.
有天晚上，他送完人，上车准备要走时，看到一辆殡仪馆的车经过，一个姑娘在后面一边追一边哭喊妈妈，他感觉心都碎了。
One night, when he was finished and ready to leave, he saw a funeral parlor car passing, a girl behind him crying for her mother, he felt his heart broken.
1月25日早上，黄晓民起床后有点咳，呼吸不顺。
On the morning of January 25, Huang Xiaomin got up with a cough and breathless.
他不想去医院检查，觉得医院病毒多、风险大，而且轻症患者只会让回家隔离。
He didn't want to go to the hospital for tests because he thought the hospital was full of viruses, high risk, and the patients would just go home and isolate themselves.
所幸他吃完药后病情渐渐好转。
Fortunately he was getting better after taking the medicine.
三天后，武汉市新增了800例确诊病例。
Three days later, 800 new cases were confirmed in Wuhan.
黄晓民知道后，在车里哭了两回。
When Huang Xiaomin heard about it, he cried twice in the car.
他觉得压力很大，担心没法保障志愿者的生命安全。
He felt stressed out and worried about not being able to keep the volunteers alive.
当天晚上，他写一份倡议书，建议从1月29号开始，志愿者暂停接单，直到获取专业的防护服和N95口罩。
That night, he wrote a proposal to suspend orders until he got professional protective clothing and a N95 mask, starting on January 29.
但第二天，依旧有车队队员私底下运送物资上一线。
The next day, however, the convoy was still carrying supplies in private.
除夕的前两天，杨柳急诊的同事确诊被感染了，当天中午就被送去了隔离区。
Two days before New Year's Eve, colleagues at Yang Liu Emergency Department confirmed that they were infected and were taken to the quarantine area at noon.
几天前，他们医院另外一个院区，一个高度疑似的病人死亡后，当天抢救的医生很快就发烧被隔离。
A few days ago, after a highly suspected patient died in another hospital compound, doctors rescued that day were quickly quarantined with fever.
截至此后的2月12日24时，全国共报告医务人员确诊感染1716名，其中有6名不幸辞世。
As of 2400 hours on 12 February, a total of 1,716 cases of infection had been reported by medical personnel throughout the country, six of whom had unfortunately died.
杨柳很害怕，妈妈打电话给她说“你回来，不要去了。
Willow was so scared that her mother called her and said, "You come back, don't go.
”但哥哥告诉她，“你不要回来，老人都年纪大了，你回来会把病毒带回家里……”杨柳呆坐在凳子上想，自己确实是病毒携带者，不能回去。
But the elder brother told her, "You do not come back, the old man is old, you will bring the virus home..." Yang Liu sat on the stool thinking that he was indeed the carrier of the virus and could not go back.
2月3日，杨柳做了CT，检查结果是双肺磨玻璃状，她被感染了，至今未见好转。
On February 3, Yang Liu underwent a CT scan, which revealed a double-pulverized glassy lung. She was infected and has not improved.
摄像头下隔离的父亲同样是2月3日，刘静的父亲入院医治不久便去世了，遗体接受表上写着“疑似肺炎”。
Liu Jing's father died shortly after being admitted to hospital on Feb. 3, and his body was written "Suspected Pneumonia" on the form.
11年前，刘静的母亲遭遇车祸，撞伤了大脑，之后没有再出去工作过。
Eleven years ago, Liu Jing's mother was involved in a car accident, bruised her brain and didn't go out to work again.
父亲今年54岁，是一名普通的工人，每个月工资四千多块钱，却省吃节用地攒下一些钱。
His father, 54, was an ordinary worker, earning more than $4,000 a month, but saved some money by cutting land.
自那次母亲生病后，父亲就想如果再生病，不要再去找别人借钱。
Since the mother was ill, my father has thought that if he was ill again, he would not borrow any money from others.
1月17日，刘静和父亲突然咳嗽，以为是感冒了。
On January 17, Liu Jing and her father coughed suddenly and thought they had a cold.
此时，武汉新冠肺炎的确诊病例很少。
At this time, Wuhan new crown pneumonia confirmed cases are very few.
刘静当时还想，武汉一千多万人，他们也没有去过华南海鲜市场，病毒不可能会落到他们头上。
Liu Jing also thought that Wuhan more than 10 million people, they have not been to the South China seafood market, the virus is unlikely to fall on them.
五天过后，刘静的体温一直在36度多，但她父亲发烧接近39度。
Five days later, Liu's temperature has been more than 36 degrees, but her father has a fever of nearly 39 degrees.
当天，父亲在家吃了退烧药，体温很快就降下去了。
On the same day, my father took the antipyretic at home and his temperature quickly dropped.
但到了第二天，他又开始发烧了。
But the next day he began to have a fever again.
当时武汉已经“封城”，汉口属于“重灾区”，刘静怕去医院交叉感染，只能让父亲先在家里隔离。
Wuhan had already "closed the city", Hankou is a "serious disaster area," Liu Jingfear to cross-infection, can only let father in the home isolation.
她每天不停地刷手机信息，看到网上说空调开到30度可以杀死病菌，她就把空调调到30度。
She brushes cell phone messages every day, watching the internet say 30 degrees can kill germs, and sets the air conditioner to 30 degrees.
但她一开空调，父亲就说他要热死了。
But when she turned on the air conditioner, my father said he was going to die of heat.
刘静听到这话，跑回房间哭了。
Liu listened and ran back to his room to cry.
那两天，父亲每两个小时量一次体温，“看到37度，他就很开心；一量到39度，他又发慌”。
On those two days, my father took his temperature every two hours. "He was happy to see 37 degrees, and he panicked when he measured 39 degrees.
1月26日，父亲一个人去了社区医院查血。
On 26 January, the father went to the community hospital alone for blood tests.
回来后，刘静把父亲的检查结果发给了学医的朋友，对方看了说CRP的指标（C反应蛋白）小于5 mg/L，而新冠肺炎患者这个数值都非常高。
When Liu Jing returned, she sent her father's test results to a medical friend, who looked at CRP indicators (C-reactive protein) of less than 5 mg / L, which is very high in patients with new crown pneumonia.
但刘静不放心，当天下午又让父亲再去武汉普爱医院做CT。
But Liu Jing was not worried, that afternoon let his father to Wuhan Puai Hospital to do CT.
他们家离医院有点远，家里又没有车。
They live a little far from the hospital and have no car at home.
刘静联系社区，社区说没有车，她又打了120，对方答应调度车辆过来。
Liu Jing contacted the community, the community said there was no car, she called 120, the other side agreed to dispatch vehicles to come.
刘静记得，那天去医院前，父亲在家哭了很久，边哭边说放不下她们母女俩。
Liu Jing remembers going to the hospital that day, his father cried at home for a long time, crying that they could not put down their mother and daughter.
“结果不太好，基本上确定是这个病毒。
"It didn't work. Basically, it was the virus.
”父亲在医院打电话来，母亲听到后，像个小孩一样哭得很厉害，说他很可怜，没享到什么福。
"My father phoned at the hospital, and when my mother heard it, she cried like a child, saying that he was poor and did not enjoy much happiness.
父亲的CT显示肺部有磨玻璃阴影，确诊为双肺病毒性肺炎。
My father's CT revealed a grinded glass shadow in the lungs and was diagnosed with two-lung viral pneumonia.
医生说是新冠肺炎，但因为没有试剂盒，也没办法确诊。
Doctors said it was new crown pneumonia, but since there was no test kit, there was no way to confirm it.
第二天早上，他整个人烧得不行，刘静又给他吃了退烧药。
The next morning, his whole body burned badly, Liu Jing gave him the antipyretic.
事实上，自武汉“封城”后，母亲就一个人睡在客厅。
In fact, since Wuhan "closed the city", the mother slept alone in the living room.
家里的菜炒出来就会装成三份，三人在各自的区域吃。
Fried home dishes will be disguised as three, three people in their respective areas to eat.
大家交流基本都靠微信和电话。
Everyone basically depends on the microphone and telephone.
刘静只有在擦酒精、送饭的时候，才会进父亲的房间，父亲总是让她快点出去。
Liu Jing will enter her father's room only when she is cleaning the alcohol and delivering the food.
家里家客厅原来有个摄像头，刘静把它拆下来装到了父亲的房间，时不时地在手机里看看他——他经常卷在被子里，露出一只脚，大喘气地呼吸，有时重重地咳嗽。
There used to be a video camera in the family living room. Liu Jing took it down and loaded it into his father's room and looked at him from time to time on his mobile phone - often curled up in a quilt, showing one foot, breathing heavily and sometimes coughing heavily.
刘静越看越沉重。
Liu Jing looked heavier and heavier.
1月30日凌晨近两点，刘静无法入睡，盯着监控视频里父亲的脚发呆。
January 30 near 2 a.m., Liu Jing can not sleep, staring at the video surveillance of his father's feet in a daze.
父亲脚板上贴着的是“去湿气的足贴”，父女俩都不知道这是不是会有效，总归还是试一下。
On the father's plank was a "dehydrated foot sticker," and neither father nor daughter knew whether it would work.
受访者供图1月27日晚上，刘静听朋友说武汉协和西院第二天会增加600个床位。
During the night of Jan. 27, Liu listened to a friend saying that Wuhan Concorde West Court would add 600 beds the next day.
她一整晚没睡着，早上6点就开始拨打了120，一直到8点多，120回复说没有床位。
She stayed up all night, dialing 120 at 6 a.m. and continuing until well over 8 a.m., 120 said there were no beds.
于是他们又没去成。
So they didn't make it.
那天中午，叔叔带着父亲又去了武汉普爱医院，抽了一大管血，说要等四个半小时才能出结果。
At noon that day, uncle and his father went to Wuhan Puai Hospital, drew a large tube of blood, said to wait for four and a half hours before the results.
刘静以为是给父亲做了核酸检验，后来去拿报告，才发现是血常规报告，她非常失望。
Liu Jing thought she had done a nucleic acid test for her father, then went to get the report, only to find it was a routine report, she was very disappointed.
刘静希望父亲住院治疗，这样一天来回奔波，精神会越加得不好。
Liu Jing hopes that his father hospitalized, such a day to and fro, the spirit will be worse.
她打120、社区、市长热线……能打的都打了，基本都回复说让上报社区，但她早就上报了。
She called 120, the community, the mayor's hotline... everything she could call, basically replied to the community, but she had already reported.
刘静知道武汉的床位确实不够，但她还是得想各种办法，“我怕爸爸跟新闻里的人一样，还没开始医治就去世了”。
Liu Jing knows that Wuhan is not enough beds, but she still has to think of ways, "I am afraid that the father and the people in the news, before the beginning of medical treatment died.
几天后，父亲终于住院了，他一度好转，还跟女儿讨论退休养老的事。
A few days later, my father finally went to the hospital. He was feeling better and was discussing retirement with his daughter.
2月3日，父亲在医院突然呼吸衰竭死亡。
