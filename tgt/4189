新华社香港3月19日电 香港特区政府渔农自然护理署19日表示，继此前一只宠物松鼠狗对新冠病毒测试呈弱阳性反应后，又有一只狗在新冠病毒反复测试中呈阳性反应。
The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) said yesterday that another dog tested positive for the new crown virus after a pet squirrel dog tested weak positive for the virus.
此次个案涉及一只德国狼狗，由于其饲养者确诊新冠肺炎，该狗于18日被送至港珠澳大桥口岸动物居留所接受检疫。
The case involved a German wolf dog who was admitted to the animal shelter at the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge on Friday after his keeper was diagnosed with pneumonia.
虽然病毒测试呈阳性，该狗并未出现相关病征。
Although the dog tested positive for the virus, the dog did not show signs of the disease.
一同被送往检疫的另一只狗在病毒测试中未呈阳性反应，也未出现相关病征。
The other dog sent to quarantine together did not test positive for the virus and did not show any related symptoms.
渔护署发言人表示，会继续对上述狗进行密切监察，并会为其进行反复测试。
A AFCD spokesman said the dogs would continue to be closely monitored and tested repeatedly.
发言人强调，目前没有证据显示宠物会传播新冠病毒给人类或会因此生病，宠物饲养者应保持良好卫生习惯，不应弃养宠物。
The spokesman stressed that there was no evidence that pets could transmit the virus to humans or become ill. Pet keepers should maintain good hygiene practices and should not abandon pets.
为确保公众和动物健康，渔护署强烈建议将与新冠病毒确诊者或其密切接触者同住的宠物（哺乳类动物，包括猫狗），安排在渔护署检疫设施接受检疫。
To ensure public and animal health, AFCD strongly recommends that pets (mammals, including cats and dogs) who are in close contact with those diagnosed with the new crown virus be quarantined at AFCD quarantine facilities.
