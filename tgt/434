They are eager to go home, and feel uneasy about the journey home and the life after they return home.
作者 | 第一财经林春挺等待了整整两周之后，滞留在海南的武汉游客马丽终于等到了可以回家的消息。
After a two-week wait at first, Wuhan tourist Mary, stranded in Hainan province, finally got word that she could go home.
2月4日，武汉市新型肺炎防控指挥部办公室印发的《武汉市防控新型肺炎期间在外人员返汉工作实施方案》（下称“《方案》”）指出，根据中央和湖北省的相关通知要求，在外人员返汉坚持“自愿、有序、可控、平稳、安全”的原则下，对在省外滞留的武汉市民启动返汉安排。
On February 4, 2007, the Bureau of the Wuhan New Pneumonia Prevention and Control Command issued the Implementation Plan for the Prevention and Control of Returnees Work in the New Pneumonia Period in Wuhan City (hereinafter referred to as "the Program").
武汉市长专线微信公众号2月7日正式对外发布了该《方案》。
Wuhan City Director of the line Weixin Public on February 7, the official release of the program.
2月5日，马丽和其他100余名互不相识的滞留三亚“武汉小伙伴”，组建了一个名叫“三亚联络群（武汉小伙伴）”的微信群，商讨在2月16日包机返汉计划，并正在接龙报名。
On February 5, Mary and more than 100 other unknown "Wuhan friends" in Sanya formed a micro-group called "Sanya Liaison Group (Wuhan Xiaogang)" to discuss the February 16 charter flight to return to China.
“这么多天来，我一直想回家。
"I've been wanting to go home for so many days.
”2月6日，马丽在接受第一财经1℃记者采访时说，“家里还有老人需要照顾。
"There are still elderly people to take care of at home," Ma told reporters on Feb. 6.
”但冷静下来，马丽又对回家之路充满着矛盾。
But calm down and Mary was ambivalent about going home again.
“武汉现在的情况并不乐观，小区居民一个接着一个感染病毒，陆续住进医院。
"Wuhan is not optimistic about the current situation, residential areas one after another infected with the virus, one after another into the hospital.
”她说，“此时回家，多少有点风险。
'she said.' Going home now is a little risky.
”多名滞留海南的武汉游客在接受1℃记者采访时也表达了同样的观点。
Wuhan tourists staying in Hainan Province expressed the same view in an interview with reporters at 1oC.
他们中，有的亲戚和朋友已经因为新冠肺炎去世。
Some of their relatives and friends have died of pneumonia.
现在，他们一边渴望着回家，一边又对回家的过程和回家后的生活充满着种种不安。
Now, as they yearn to go home, they are filled with uneasiness about going home and going home.
渴望回家自1月23日武汉封城以来，马丽一家三口一直想回家，但不断升级的疫情，让从海南到武汉的交通受到了管制。
Wuhan Hainan City Since the city was closed on January 23, the Marys have been wanting to go home, but escalating outbreaks have limited traffic from Hainan to Wuhan.
最后，她只好和其他武汉人一样，继续留在海南，等待返汉消息。
Finally, like other Wuhan people, she had to stay in Hainan, waiting for the return of Han news.
马丽今年36岁，在武汉一家科技公司上班，2020年1月18日晚上，她带着自己的爱人和孩子从武汉飞到了三亚，计划在1月24日回到武汉。
Mary, 36, works for a Wuhan-based technology company and flew to Sanya with her lover and children on the night of January 18, 2020, planning to return to Wuhan on January 24.
但1月23日武汉实施封城之后，她此前预定的机票也被临时取消了。
But after Wuhan imposed the ban on January 23, her previously booked tickets were temporarily cancelled.
回家过年的计划破灭后，马丽并没有和其他武汉老乡一样继续住在酒店，而是投奔一位在海南文昌买了房子的亲戚。
Instead of staying at the hotel like the other Wuhan villagers, Mary turned to a relative who had bought a house in Wenchang, Hainan Province.
“相对来说，我比其他人幸运。
"Relatively speaking, I'm luckier than everyone else.
”她说。
'she said.
多名在外的武汉游客在接受1℃记者采访时说，因为是来自武汉这个身份，加上疫情不断升级，他们曾一度得不到酒店的待见，最后只能一家宾馆挨着一家宾馆地找，直到找到能够接待的地方为止。
Wuhan-based tourists who had been unable to find a hotel because of their Wuhan identity and the escalating epidemic were left with only one hotel next to another until they could find a place to stay, Wuhan-based tourists told reporters on Monday.
在外面的种种遭遇，让他们变得回家心切。
What happened outside made them eager to go home.
他们想回家的原因还有许多，比如马丽和他爱人的父母，都已经七十岁了，不懂得使用手机在网上购物，只能一周出去买一次菜回来囤着。
They also want to go home for many reasons, such as Mary and his wife's parents, are 70 years old, do not know how to use mobile phones shopping online, can only go out once a week to buy food back hoard.
更不好的情况时，她的公公还患有轻微的脑梗，在他们来到三亚之前才刚刚出院，家里的存药不多，还需要他们回去照顾。
To make matters worse, her father-in-law also had a mild cerebral infarction and had just left the hospital just before they arrived in Sanya.
尽管自己在海南的境况比其他武汉游客还好，但在亲戚家住了几天后，马丽开始感觉到有点不好意思，所以一直在寻找回家的办法。
Although she was better off in Hainan than other Wuhan tourists, Mary began to feel a bit embarrassed after spending a few days with relatives, so she kept looking for ways to go home.
“当时我的第一个想法是买飞机票到长沙，然后从长沙坐火车回去。
"My first thought was to buy a plane ticket to Changsha and then go back by train from Changsha.
”她说。
'she said.
不过，由于武汉情况一直没有转好，而且眼看还在继续恶化，马丽的父母并不支持她的做法。
However, as the situation in Wuhan has not improved, and seems to continue to deteriorate, Mary's parents do not support her approach.
他们告诉她，能不回去就别回去。
They told her not to go back without it.
马丽在武汉的家，正好位于武汉公布的第一批定点收治医院附近。
Mary's home in Wuhan, just announced in Wuhan, the first designated hospital near the hospital.
就这样，马丽选择在海南继续观察，看看接下来会有多少在外地的武汉人回去。
In this way, Mary chose to continue to observe in Hainan, to see how many of the next Wuhan people will go back.
到了1月31日，湖北省新型冠状病毒感染肺炎疫情防控指挥部发布了一则通告，通告要求湖北省各市（州）、县（市、区）新型冠状病毒感染肺炎疫情防控指挥部（下称“防控指挥部”）负责统筹做好本辖区范围内返鄂返汉人员的跟踪服务、卫生防疫等工作。
On January 31, the Command of Prevention and Control of the New Coronavirus Infection Pneumonia in Hubei Province issued a circular instructing all cities (counties), counties (cities and districts) in Hubei Province to take charge of coordinating the follow-up service and anti-epidemic work for the returned Hubei people within their jurisdiction.
也是在1月31日，中国政府派出的首批民航包机先后从泰国曼谷、马来西亚哥打基纳巴卢抵达武汉天河国际机场，接回199名滞留在当地的湖北籍公民。
Also on January 31, the first charter flights by the Chinese government arrived at Wuhan Tianhe International Airport from Bangkok, Thailand, and Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia, to pick up 199 stranded Hubei citizens.
大约就在这时，马丽在自己所在的武汉人滞留海南的微信群里看到有人说，他准备要回去工作了，并告知大家可以组织返汉计划。
About this time, Mary in his Wuhan people stay in Hainan micro-letter group to see that he is ready to go back to work, and told everyone can organize a return to the Han plan.
“他好像是（武汉市）政府的基层公务员，单位当时要他必须回汉。
"He seemed to be a grass-roots civil servant in the government [of Wuhan] and the unit asked him to return to Han.
”马丽说，“他当时联系到了武汉市文旅局的人，说政府就要在2月4日印发在外的武汉人可以包机回去的方案，于是他就提出了2月10日包机回去的意见。
"He contacted the Wuhan Bureau of Arts and Tourism and said Wuhan people who would be out on February 4 could charter a return flight, so he offered to charter flights back on February 10," she said.
”紧接着，马丽所说的这个“好像是武汉市政府的基层公务员”的人就和其他人组建了一个包机返汉的微信群，计划在2月10日包机返汉。
Then came what Mary described as a "low-level civil servant in Wuhan city government" who, along with others, formed a charter flight to return to Han China, scheduled to return on February 10.
回家前的不安但马丽和部分人员担心，武汉的疫情现在还处于爆发期，选择2月10日回去有点早。
Unrest before returning home But Mary and some people worry that Wuhan is still in the outbreak of the epidemic, February 10 to choose to go back a bit early.
于是，他们就另外建立这个名叫“三亚联络群（武汉小伙伴）”的微信群，并计划在2月16日包机返汉。
So they set up a separate microcosm called "Sanya Contact Group" and planned to return on February 16 with a charter flight.
“终于找到组织了！”加入该群后，有人这样说。
"Finally found the organization!" someone said after joining the group.
马丽向1℃记者表示，自己的想法其实和其大家一样，就是找到一个安全有效的组织回去就很好。
Ma told reporters at 1º C that her idea, like everyone else, was to find a safe and effective organization to go back to.
自2月5日当天建立“三亚联络群（武汉小伙伴）”微信群以后，加入群里的人越来越多。
Since the establishment of the "Sanya Liaison Group" micro-group on February 5, more and more people have joined the group.
截至2月7日，就已经加入了107滞留“小伙伴”。
As of February 7, it had joined 107 "small partners" in detention.
在群里，1℃记者看到，所有人都非常积极，一个接着一个进行接龙报名，当天报名人数就有37人，其中大部分人都是拖家带口，最后的总报名人数共125人。
In the group, the reporter saw that everyone is very active, one after another to carry out the enrollment, the day of the enrollment of 37 people, most of them are family, the final total number of registration 125.
但在2月5日以后，群里再也没有人接龙报名了。
But after February 5, no one in the group signed up.
在群里，有些人开始变得有些犹豫，他们中有人说：“现在回去肯定不是好主意。
Some of the group began to hesitate, and one of them said, "It's definitely not a good idea to go back now.
”接着有人回复说：“是的，武汉现在还没稳定，能不回去就别回去。
"Wuhan is not stable now. If you can't go back, don't go back.
”马丽对此深有同感。
Mary felt the same way.
事实上，马丽从2月1日就开始产生了紧张情绪。
In fact, Mary began to get nervous on February 1.
“（我听说）我们家周边小区的居民，以及我同事、朋友的家人都出现不同程度的（感染）情况，”她说，“我觉得现在武汉的事情很严重。
"[I hear] the residents of our neighborhood, as well as the families of my colleagues and friends, have all had varying degrees of [infection]," she said.
”2月6日晚，她在接受1℃记者采访时说，自己刚刚与在武汉的父母进行了视频，父亲现在有点感冒，正在发烧。
In an interview with her parents in Wuhan on the evening of Feb. 6, she said her father, who had caught a cold and was having a fever, had just taken a video with her parents in Wuhan.
这事让她在感到着急的同时，也感到很紧张。
It made her nervous as well as anxious.
还好，她说目前来看父亲只是普通的感冒。
Luckily, she said, visiting her father at the moment was just a common cold.
在另一个滞留海南的武汉游客组建的微信群里，1℃记者看到，一位群友在几天前哭诉说，因为在1月份通过其他渠道仓促返汉，她的婆婆回到武汉后就感染了新冠肺炎病毒。
A group of friends sobbed a few days ago to say that her mother-in-law had contracted the new crown pneumonia virus after returning to Wuhan in January after hurriedly returning to Wuhan through other channels.
1℃记者注意到，类似的说法，在北京、广东、泰国、海南等地方的武汉游客组建的微信群里都有讨论，一种紧张的情绪包围着正在计划回家的他们。
A similar sentiment surrounds them as they plan to return home, according to a similar statement, as discussed in a small group of Wuhan tourists from Beijing, Guangdong, Thailand and Hainan.
为此，有的干脆放弃了最近返汉的计划，选择继续留在所在地观察武汉的情况。
For this reason, some simply abandoned the recent Han plan, choose to remain in the site to observe the situation in Wuhan.
陈月明就是其中一位，她1月份接受1℃记者采访时还表示，为何政府不允许他们包机回去。
Chen, one of them, also told reporters in January why the government did not allow them to charter flights.
但现在，她说，目前还是留在海南的好。
But now, she says, it's better to stay in Hainan right now.
在“三亚联络群（武汉小伙伴）”微信群里，接着上述“现在回去肯定不是好主意”的话题，有的人回复说：“不给武汉政府添麻烦，等不封城了再回，回去政府还要想办法把大家运回家，（在外地）能克服就克服一下。
"In the" Sanya liaison group (Wuhan small partners) "micro-letter group, and then the topic of" return now is certainly not a good idea, "some people replied:" do not give Wuhan government trouble, until the city again, back to the government to find ways to transport everyone home (in the field) overcome it.
”类似的说法，也出现在“海口包机回武汉群”里。
A similar statement appeared in the "Haikou charter flight back to Wuhan Group."
该群共有103位武汉游客，他们正在接龙报名于2月10日返汉，目前报名人数已经有100多名。
The group of 103 Wuhan tourists, who are returning to China on February 10, has so far registered more than 100.
《方案》未打消顾虑果然，2月4日，武汉市防控指挥部办公室印发布了《武汉市防控新型冠状病毒感染肺炎疫情期间在外人员返汉工作实施方案》，也就是群友们之前所称“可以包机回去的方案”。
As expected, on February 4, the Wuhan Municipal Office of Control and Prevention issued the Implementation Plan for the Prevention and Control of the New Coronavirus Infected with Pneumonia in Wuhan City.
这一消息很快地就在马丽他们的微信群里流传开来。
The news soon spread through Mary's small group of letters.
马丽通过研读《方案》发现，武汉市明确在外人员的返汉坚持“自愿、有序、可控、平稳、安全”原则，坚持错峰返程和分批实施，同时对在外人员返汉工作进行诸多的细致安排。
Through studying the Plan, Mary found that Wuhan city adhered to the principle of "voluntariness, order, control, stability and security" in returning to the Han Dynasty, insisting on the principle of "voluntary, orderly, controllable, stable and safe."
比如，《方案》要求，武汉在外人员返汉以后，各区防控指挥部负责安排省内交通适宜，对有一定数量规模的人群，可以组织集中运送直达目的地。
For example, the Plan requires Wuhan, after returning to the Han Dynasty, to make arrangements for transportation within the province by the regional command for prevention and control.
对有乘坐火车、飞机返汉需求的，提请防控指挥部统一协调安排，必要时上报湖北省防控指挥部。
For those who need to return to Han by train or plane, the unified coordination arrangements should be put forward and reported to the Hubei Provincial Command of Prevention and Control when necessary.
该《方案》还对武汉在外滞留人员返汉以后的防控管理作出了具体安排。
The Plan also makes specific arrangements for the control and control of Wuhan after the return of the stranded persons.
比如，如果这些返汉人员出现发热等相关症状，就需要及时报告和就诊。
For example, if these returnees develop fever and other related symptoms, they need to be reported and treated promptly.
再比如，这些人返汉后，如何稳定他们的情绪，以尽快适应生活和工作。
For example, how do these people stabilize their emotions after they return to China in order to get used to life and work as soon as possible?
但马丽等人还是对返汉的过程和返汉后的生活有所担忧。
But Mary and others are still worried about the process of returning to Han and their life after Han Dynasty.
马丽说，家里备了酒精和口罩等防护设备，但是没有护目镜和防护服。
Mary said protective equipment, such as alcohol and masks, was available, but there were no goggles or protective clothing.
她担心回到武汉可能面临防护物品及其他物资紧缺的问题，这些天她看到了大量这方面的新闻。
She worries that returning to Wuhan, where she has seen a lot of news these days, may face shortages of protective gear and other supplies.
事实上，马丽的担心并非多余。
In fact, Mary's concerns are not superfluous.
2月2日，中央应对新型冠状病毒感染肺炎疫情工作领导小组会议指出，疫情发生后，国家从各方面抽调人力物力集中给予支持，但湖北目前医疗资源短缺问题仍然突出。
On February 2, the meeting of the Central Leading Group for Response to the New Coronavirus Infection Pneumonia noted that the shortage of medical resources in Hubei Province remained a serious problem after the outbreak of the epidemic.
其中，武汉市的疫情防控物资需要是重中之重。
Among them, Wuhan city's epidemic prevention and control materials need to be a top priority.
另外，“我们还是担心，回武汉之后，最后一公里怎么解决？”马丽说。
In addition, "we still worry, back to Wuhan, the last kilometer how to solve?" Mary said.
虽然根据《方案》，返汉人员乘坐飞机到了机场后，政府可以用专车送到相应地点，但他们也担心，会不会事实上很难保障把每个人都真正送到家，毕竟目前武汉的包括交通在内的各种资源太紧缺了。
While under the Programme returnees arrive at the airport by air, the Government can transport them by special bus to the respective locations, they are concerned about the practical difficulties of ensuring that everyone is actually delivered to their homes, given the current scarcity of resources, including transportation, in Wuhan.
不过，尽管尚有各种疑虑和担心，但考虑到自己和爱人的父母已经年迈、身体欠佳等原因，马丽几天前还是填写了一份返汉申请表。
However, despite all her doubts and fears, Mary filled out a return-to-Han application a few days ago, considering that she and her partner's parents were old and in poor health.
根据《方案》，目前在外人员返汉需要填写一份名叫《在外人员返汉申请表》，并通过网络、微信、QQ、传真、电子邮件等便捷方式向所在单位或社区提出返回申请。
According to the Program, returning foreign workers are now required to fill out an application form called "Return of Foreign Personnel" and apply to their unit or community for return by convenient means, such as Internet, micro-mail, QQ, fax, e-mail, etc.
对在省外探亲访友或自由旅行的武汉市民，按照属地原则，由在外人员所在街道、社区负责收集汇总返回人员(游客)申请表格，及时统一上报区防控指挥部。
In accordance with the principle of territoriality, Wuhan city residents who visit relatives and friends or travel freely outside the province are responsible for collecting and compiling application forms for returnees (tourists) and submitting them to the District Control Command in a timely and unified manner.
但她的申请至今尚未得到回复。
However, her application has not yet been responded to.
这可能与马丽的工作性质有关。
This may be related to the nature of Mary's work.
因为根据上述《方案》，在外人员返汉，“优先安排医疗防疫机构、防疫药品、用品、药械等生产经营单位、保障城市公共事业运行必需、群众生活必需、经批准的重大工程以及重要国计民生相关企业等方面从业人员返回”。
According to the above-mentioned Plan, when returning to China, priority will be given to those working in production and business operations such as medical and epidemic prevention institutions, epidemic prevention drugs, supplies and drugs, as well as those necessary for the operation of urban public services, essential to the livelihood of the people, approved major projects and enterprises related to national livelihood.
“我现在没有别的办法，只有等待回复。
"I have no choice but to wait for a reply.
”马丽说。
"said Mary.
