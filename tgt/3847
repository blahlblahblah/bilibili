”3月16日，云南彝良县通报“医务人员自愿放弃申领抗疫补助”一事调查及处理情况。
On March 16, Yi Liangxian County, Yunnan Province, announced the investigation and handling of the case of "medical staff voluntarily giving up claiming anti-epidemic subsidies."
通报称，通过调查未发现院方要求和统一组织医务人员放弃申领补助的情况，但是存在对相关补助政策宣传讲解不到位的情况，为此，彝良县委、县政府责成县人民医院立即整改前一阶段工作中存在的问题，切实加强对统计上报工作的组织领导及政策宣传培训工作，确保精准统计上报兑现补助，切实把国家对一线医务人员的关心关爱政策落实到符合条件的每一个医务人员。
According to the circular, the survey did not reveal any request from the hospital and unified organization of medical staff to give up the claim, but there was insufficient publicity and explanation on the relevant subsidy policy. As a result, the Yi Liang county Party Committee and county governments instructed county people's hospitals to rectify the problems in the previous phase.
在下一步工作中，对贯彻落实政策不到位、组织不力的单位和个人将严肃追究责任。
In the next step, those units and individuals who have failed to implement policies and are poorly organized will be held seriously accountable.
通报全文如下：近日，媒体刊发了云南省昭通市彝良县人民医院部分医务人员自愿放弃申领抗疫临时性工作补助的报道，引发网络热议，造成不良影响。
The notice reads as follows: Recently, the media reported that some medical staff of Yi Liang County People's Hospital in Zhaotong City, Yunnan Province, voluntarily gave up applying for temporary work subsidies to fight against SARS.
对此，彝良县委、县政府深表歉意，并责成相关部门组成调查组进驻县人民医院开展调查核实，现将初步调查情况向社会各界作如下通报：彝良县人民医院现有职工608人。
To this end, the Yi Liang County Party Committee and the county government apologized and instructed the relevant departments to form an investigation team to enter the county people's hospital for investigation and verification.
按照《云南省卫生健康委关于开展新冠肺炎疫情防治人员临时性工作补助统计汇总工作的通知》（以下简称《通知》）的相关规定，彝良县人民医院3月1日完成了对执行各类补助标准人员的统计和单位内部公示工作，拟上报补助的人员共126人。
On March 1, the People's Hospital of Yi Liang County completed the work of counting and publicizing the work of the personnel in charge of carrying out various types of subsidies, and 126 people proposed to report subsidies.
通过调查未发现院方要求和统一组织医务人员放弃申领补助的情况。
The investigation did not reveal any requests from the hospital and the uniform organization of waivers of benefits by medical personnel.
彝良县人民医院在统计上报本单位一线职工临时性工作补助中，未统一组织医务人员对《通知》规定的相关程序和报批要求进行准确全面的宣传和讲解，导致部分医务人员对相关规定存在理解不到位，在还未完成上报核定并取得补助的情况下表达了放弃申领补助的意愿，院方未予制止。
The Yi Liangxian People's Hospital did not uniformly publicize and explain the relevant procedures and approval requirements stipulated in the Notice to the first-line workers in the Yi Liang County People's Hospital. The hospital did not stop the medical staff from giving up their willingness to apply for the subsidy after the approval of the notification had not been completed.
为此，彝良县委、县政府已责成县人民医院立即整改前一阶段工作中存在的问题，切实加强对统计上报工作的组织领导及政策宣传培训工作，确保严格按照《国务院应对新型冠状病毒感染肺炎疫情防控联控机制关于聚焦一线贯彻落实保护关心爱护医务人员措施的通知》（国发电〔2020〕10号）要求，精准统计上报兑现补助，切实把国家对一线医务人员的关心关爱政策落实到符合条件的每一个医务人员。
To this end, the Lolos County Party Committee and county governments have instructed county people's hospitals to immediately rectify the problems existing in the previous stage of work, effectively strengthen the organization and leadership of statistical reporting work, and ensure strict compliance with the State Council's Circular on Implementation of Measures to Protect Care and Care for Medical Personnel.
在下一步工作中，对贯彻落实政策不到位、组织不力的单位和个人将严肃追究责任。
In the next step, those units and individuals who have failed to implement policies and are poorly organized will be held seriously accountable.
衷心感谢社会各界对我县工作的关注、关爱和理解，并恳请社会各界继续关心、支持、监督我县贯彻落实国家对一线医务人员关心关爱政策的后续相关工作。
I sincerely thank the community for their concern, care and understanding of the work of our county, and urge the community to continue to care for, support and monitor the implementation of the state care policy for front-line medical personnel follow-up work.
