Phoenix News client-side Phoenix Internet studio in the morning of January 18, 2020, the weather as usual as clear.
在汉口中山公园西南角的一间健身房里，72岁的邱钧正向笔者描绘自己的规划——今年6月，他将前往南京参加“世界奥赛之夜”健美比赛，而在2019年，邱钧曾拿下此项赛事的老年组亚军。
In a gym in the southwest corner of Hankou Zhongshan Park, 72-year-old Qiu Jun is describing his plans to travel to Nanjing for the "World Olympic Night" bodybuilding competition in June this year.
那天的邱钧，像往常一样雕琢他的肌肉，跟随他一同练习的学生有些担忧：“最近流感的传言很凶，不要待在健身房，太密闭了。
That day Qiu Jun, as usual, carved out his muscles, and the students he practiced with worried: "Recent rumors of flu are so strong, don't stay in the gym, it's too closed.
”可直到1月20日，钟南山院士宣布“新型肺炎存在人传人现象”的当天，邱钧依旧待在他钟爱的健身房。
But Qiu Jun stayed at his favourite gym until Jan. 20, the day academician Zhong Nan-shan announced that there was "human-to-human transmission of the new pneumonia.
2月6日，邱钧家人在他的朋友圈发出一条信息：“从不生病的父亲却没有躲开这场灾难……”在汉口中山公园的一隅，几乎每天都能看到邱钧的身影。
On February 6, Qiu Jun family in his circle of friends sent a message: "never sick father but did not escape the disaster..." In Hankou Zhongshan Park, a corner of Qiu Jun can be seen almost every day.
酒红色的老旧布袋，里面是各式健身器材：一把健身轮、一对5公斤的小型哑铃以及衣物、水杯。
Wine-red old cloth bags, inside is a variety of fitness equipment: a fitness wheel, a pair of 5 kg of small dumbbells, as well as clothing, water cups.
邱钧1米7左右的个子，并不高大，却拥有健硕的臂膀。
Qiu Jun 1 meter 7 about the stature, is not tall, actually has the robust arm.
每天上午9点，邱钧的身影都会准时在此出现。
Every morning at 9 a.m., Qiu Jun's figure will appear here on time.
当他穿着背心、或光着膀子在锻炼的人群中经过时，总会显得格外亮眼。
When he passed through the exercising crowd in his vest, or naked, it was always very bright.
清晨的中山公园是老年人的乐园，栏杆外是匆匆经过准备上班的年轻人。
Zhongshan Park in the early morning is a paradise for the elderly, the railing is hurriedly ready to go to work young people.
这里的晨练方式有很多，散步的、慢跑的，甚至有撞树的，而邱钧的健美身材和一身专业的装备，总会吸引路人的目光。
Here there are many morning exercises, walking, jogging, and even hit trees, while Qiu Jun fitness and a professional equipment, will always attract the eyes of passers-by.
他上午在公园健身三个小时，整个下午都在健身房。
He worked out in the park for three hours in the morning and stayed in the gym all afternoon.
2003年邱钧退休，一位开健身房的朋友给了他一张终身免费健身卡。
In 2003 Qiu Jun retired, a gym friend gave him a life-long free fitness card.
不久之后，已经56岁的他，开始与其他20多岁的教练们一同卖卡、授课，一同参加健美比赛。
Soon after, at the age of 56, he began selling cards, teaching classes and taking part in fitness competitions with other coaches in his 20s.
他说不是为赚钱，每次外出参加健美比赛，他都要自费2000元以上，这还不包括报名费。
He said that instead of making money, he had to pay more than 2,000 yuan at his own expense every time he went out to participate in a fitness competition.
随着锻炼，邱钧的体态也越来越好，俨然成了健身房的活招牌。
With the exercise, Qiu Jun's body posture also more and more good, has become the living sign of the gym.
2019年底，邱钧为健身房招揽了几位顾客，全是老大爷，除了被邱钧吸引，还有一个简单的原因，健身房做促销，月卡只需19.9元。
At the end of 2019, Qiu Jun recruited several customers for the gym, all big men. Apart from being attracted to Qiu Jun, there was also a simple reason why the gym took out a promotion for 19.9 yuan a month.
省钱，是大多中老年人的生活方式和选择。
Saving money is the lifestyle and choice of most middle-aged and old people.
在这里，除了平常一道锻炼的老年人，邱钧还有一些比他年轻的学生，比如露露，一位在附近医院工作的40岁女性，是两位孩子母亲，已在这间健身房锻炼多年。
Here, in addition to the usual elderly people who exercise together, Qiu Jun has other younger students, such as Lulu, a 40-year-old woman working in a nearby hospital and mother of two, who has been working at the gym for years.

从公园到健身房，邱钧的学生有很多，他对学生的要求很严格，手握器材的每个动作都会示范一遍，还会帮着数动作次数。
From the park to the gymnasium, Qiu Jun has many students. He is very strict with his students. He will demonstrate every movement of his equipment and help count the movements.
1990年，那时的健身还是新奇玩意，不知“健美”为何物的邱钧，因有跑步锻炼的习惯，代表厂里参加了湖北省第一届健美大赛。
In 1990, fitness was still a novelty, I do not know what "fitness" for Qiu Jun, because of the habit of running, on behalf of the factory to participate in the first fitness contest in Hubei Province.
在黄冈新搭建的体育馆舞台中央，邱钧第一次向旁人展示自己的身材，随即口哨声、喝彩声频出。
In the middle of the newly built stadium in Huanggang, Qiu Jun showed off his figure for the first time, then whistled and cheered loudly.
那一年的比赛，邱钧拿到全省第五名。
That year's competition, Qiu Jun took the province's fifth place.
也是从那时起，他开始了自己的健美路。
It was also since then that he started his own fitness program.

▪ Wuchang depot site, has become Wuhan landmark buildings: Wuhan green space center.
1950年，邱钧在两岁时，便随着在部队的父亲，从福州来到武汉汉口。
In 1950, when Qiu Jun was two years old, he came to Hankou from Fuzhou with his father in the army.
父亲在部队里从事勘察工作，大部分时间都在外地。
My father spent most of his time in the field, surveying the army.
邱钧和另外三个兄弟一同，与母亲生活，上世纪的五、六十年代，注定是不好度过的。
Qiu Jun and the other three brothers lived with their mother and were doomed to a bad time in the 1950s and 1960s.
在那段紧巴的岁月中，邱钧每天会去看着部队里的战士，练操、出操、跑步，还跟着有样学样，他说希望在外工作的父亲回家的时候能够看到自己的变化。
In those hard-pressed years, Qiu Jun would watch the soldiers in the army every day, practicing exercise, exercising, running, and so on. He said he hoped to see his changes when his father came home from work.

1964年，年仅16岁的邱钧，在中专毕业后进入武昌车辆厂，负责铁路的维护。
In 1964, only 16-year-old Qiu Jun, after graduating from secondary school into Wuchang depot, responsible for railway maintenance.
当时的车辆厂负责交通运输，而从普通工人，到司炉，再到火车司机（驾驶运输车辆），邱钧花了十年，但这并没有使他感到充实。
The depot was in charge of transportation, and it took him ten years, from the average worker to the stoker to the driver of the train (to drive the transport vehicle), but that did not enrich him.
火车司机是单位里待遇不错的岗位，整个车厂只有四个火车司机，邱钧也算春风得意，可连夜的、连续12小时的工作，以及不规律的倒班制，让他的身体开始吃不消。
The driver of the train was a well-paid position in the unit, and there were only four train drivers in the whole depot. Qiu Jun was enjoying a sleepless night, 12 hours of continuous work and irregular shift work, which began to overwhelm his body.
“出一次事故，你个人再优秀，成绩都会给你抹掉！”看着有的同事因为身体状况，在工作上出了差错，邱钧变得更加谨慎。
"An accident, your personal excellence, results will be erased!" Looking at some colleagues because of the physical condition, mistakes in the work, Qiu Jun became more cautious.
当生活变得乏味、且疲惫时，邱钧会到单位的操场上跑步，两圈、三圈，直至十几圈，一旁的阿姨看得不停发笑。
When life becomes boring and tired, Qiu Jun will run on the unit's playground, twice, three times, up to a dozen times, while his aunt laughed.
那一次的疯跑，看着阿姨笑得合不拢的嘴，邱钧第一次意识到，自己除了能够作为一颗螺丝钉，还可以是一捧开心果。
That time the crazy run, looking at the aunt's mouth smile closed, Qiu Jun first realized that in addition to being able to act as a screw, but also can be a handfuls of pistachio.
于是长跑、俯卧撑、引体向上成了他的生活常态。
So long-distance running, push-ups, up into his life has become the norm.
锻炼得久了，火车修理时，五十斤的铁器需要搬上车，他也能自己解决。
When the train was being repaired, fifty kilos of iron needed to be carried in, and he could do it himself.

在做了半辈子的螺丝钉后，2003年邱钧迎来了退休。
After half a lifetime of screws, Qiu Jun retired in 2003.
进入新世纪，生活水平提升了，人也变悠闲了。
As we enter the new century, living standards have risen and people have become leisurely.
邱钧在汉口有了房子，在单位还有宿舍可供居住，退休金也不少，对他来说，好日子已然来临。
For Qiu Jun, who had a house in Hankou, a dormitory to live in and a pension, the good times had come for him.
从2004年到2017年，做健身教练的日子，邱钧坚持了13年，他每天都会出现在健身房。
From 2004 to 2017, when he was a fitness instructor, Qiu Jun stayed in the gym for 13 years.
十来年里，他的身材日渐健美，许多年轻的健身教练已然离开这个职业，去寻找更有前途的行当，而他却成为了这里的招牌。
Over the past decade or so, his stature has grown, and many young fitness coaches have left the profession in search of more promising careers, and he has become the signature.
邱钧习惯于参加各式健美比赛，所获荣誉颇丰，多次在全国性的比赛中夺魁。
Qiu Jun used to take part in all kinds of bodybuilding competitions, has won a lot of honors, many times in the national competition.
对于健身运动员来说，为保持较低的体脂率，赛季期间的饮食十分节制，但到了休赛期，往往也会开怀大吃。
For fitness athletes, the season to maintain a low body fat rate, the diet is very moderate, but in off-season, also tend to enjoy eating.
邱钧不同，鸡肉、鱼肉、蔬菜，看似美味实则令人生厌的健身餐，每日三餐如此，他竟然能够“忍受”十几年。
Qiu Jun is different, chicken, fish, vegetables, looks really delicious is a boring fitness meal, three meals a day, he can "endure" more than a decade.
那时他的目标是，健美比赛最起码要比到80岁。
His goal at the time was to have at least 80 years of age in bodybuilding.
