网络直播上课第一周，老师和学生在抓狂中适应。
During the first week of live webcasting, teachers and students get used to it.
空白缠绕。
Blank entanglement.
趣闻。
Interesting news.
疫情虽险，学习不止。
Although the epidemic is dangerous, learning is not limited.
希望当下“直播上课”的情景，只是未来成功学子们回忆中一个有趣的插曲。
Hopefully, the current "live class" scenario is just an interesting episode in the memories of future successful students.
。
.
“刚才那题答对的刷个666”，女老师在直播间里喊着，屏幕上也随之刷满了来自学生们的“666”。
"Just the right answer brush 666," the female teacher shouted in the studio, and the screen was filled with "666" from the students.
这是今天的直播平台里，一场普通英语课堂的景象。
This is today's live broadcast of the platform, an ordinary English classroom scene.
。
.
截止目前，全国各地大部分学校正式启用直播上网课已经快一周了。
So far, most schools around the country have officially opened live Internet classes for nearly a week.
在这个特殊的时期中，老师和学校为了让孩子们继续学习而绞尽脑汁，但学生们也开始想尽办法来调皮捣乱。
During this particular period, teachers and schools struggle to keep their children studying, but students are also trying to be naughty.
。
.
学校里的师生博弈，又开始在网络上上演。
The game between teachers and students in the school began to play on the network again.
。
.
就像疫情一定会过去一样，返校总有到来的一天。
Just as the epidemic is bound to pass, there will come a day when we return to school.
尽管目前老师学生们都无法重回学校上学，但借助如今的网络，曾经我们畅想的“在家上课”的未来就以这种方式实现了。
Although teachers and students are unable to go back to school, today's Internet has made it possible for us to dream of a "home-schooling" future.
。
.
虽然大部分还沉浸在家里蹲的学生们都不情不愿，但大部分学校的意思还是很明显——该上还得上。
Although most of the students who are still at home are reluctant, the meaning of most schools is obvious - it has to be.
。
.
但好处在于，由于技术进步，已经有更多的平台允许师生间通过网络有更多的互动，例如签到、弹幕交流、连麦……而这也就意味着，学生们万众期待的“主播式教学”即将上演。
But the upside is that, thanks to technological advances, there are more platforms that allow more interaction between teachers and students over the network, such as check-in, bullet-screen communication, and even malt... which means that the "host-style teaching" that students so much expect is about to take place.
。
.
只不过，老师的心态是崩溃的。
It's just that the teacher's mind is crashing.
。
.
风水总要轮流转。
Feng shui always turns around.
在学校，教师总是授人以渔的一方，但随着直播上课即将到来，一些对电子产品不那么熟悉的老教师就没了办法。
In schools, teachers are always the teacher of choice, but with live classes looming, some older teachers who are less familiar with electronics have no choice.
这几日开始，视频网站上“直播上课”的教程也变得火热了起来。
Since the beginning of these days, the video site "live lessons" tutorial has become hot.
。
.
不少老师并没有类似经验，且器材缺乏，临到关头也只能急中生智来完成直播：。
Many teachers do not have similar experience, and the lack of equipment, the crisis can only come up with wisdom to complete the live broadcast:
好在这些都是不足为惧的小问题。
The good news is that these are minor problems to be reckoned with.
所以我们如今也能看到这样一幅神奇的景象：老师在镜头前正经讲课，而同学们则在底下刷起了鼓励的小礼物。
So now we can see the amazing scene where the teacher is lecturing in front of the camera and the students are brushing small gifts of encouragement under the camera.
这其中即有学校专业教师的授课过程，也有普通人开展的网络补习班，但他们的目的都只有一个——教孩子们知识。
These include the process of teaching professional teachers in schools and online cram schools for ordinary people, but they all have one purpose - to teach children knowledge.
而这幅热火朝天的学习氛围，也让最近的互联网显得其乐融融了起来。
And this hot air of study, also let the recent Internet appears to be harmonious.
。
.
只不过一旦直播开始，各种问题就开始让老师们忙晕了头。
It's just that once the live broadcast starts, the problems start to get the teachers dizzy.
比如学生们爱起花里胡哨的网名，让点名的老师不知如何开口：。
For example, the students love the colorful names of the net, so named teachers do not know how to speak:.
情急之下，有的老师连聊天机器人都不放过：。
In case of emergency, some teachers even chat robot not spared:.
也有初出茅庐的网络教师不太清楚直播平台的规矩，导致出师未捷身先死。
There are also incipient network teachers are not clear about the live broadcast platform rules, leading to the division before the death.
(这应该不是学校的老师)。
This is not supposed to be a school teacher.
而一点点小失误，也会让老师们一堂课废的口水付之东流——一位政治老师不小心开了静音，导致自己激情表演了几十分钟哑剧。
And a little mistake, teachers will be a lesson waste drool - a political teacher inadvertently silent, leading to his passion for dozens of minutes of pantomime.
。
.
至于课堂上的回答问题环节，也就成了个大麻烦。
As for the question-and-answer session in class, it becomes a big problem.
在学校，面对面教学是常态——为了关注学生的学习情况，观察表情也是有必要的一步。
Face-to-face teaching is the norm in schools - observing expressions is also a necessary step in keeping track of students' learning.
而在网络教学的途中，老师们也能通过点名开学生摄像头的功能完成这件事。
And on the way to online teaching, teachers can do this by naming and shadowing students' webcams.
。
.
只不过现在，由于大部分家长对于线上教学同样充满好奇，所以也就选择了在一旁跟读。
But now, as most parents are equally curious about online teaching, they have chosen to follow suit.
这也导致老师们面对一个尴尬现象：点名让学生回答问题，结果一开摄像头，对面一家老小开始和自己大眼瞪小眼。
This also leads teachers to face the embarrassing phenomenon of asking students to answer questions by name, only to turn on the camera and start staring at each other.
。
.
老师的视角大概是这样的：。
The teacher's perspective is probably this:
老师：紧张。
Teacher: Nervous.
而不少老师的情况也是同样“表里不一”：上半身正襟危坐给学生讲课，下半身睡裤拖鞋一应俱全。
The situation of many teachers is the same "inconsistent": upper body sitting to teach students, the lower body slippers are available.
。
.
课余时间也能搞点小动作：。
spare time can also do some small action:.
当然，尽管网络教学给了老师们不用“全副武装”的权利，但也同时要面对一些不避免的小尴尬——平时可以管住孩子们不窃窃私语，但现在可不知道他们背地里在议论些啥。
Of course, while online instruction gives teachers the right not to be "fully armed," they also face the inevitable little embarrassment of being able to keep their children quiet, but don't know what they're talking about behind their backs.
。
.
最棘手的问题是，一部分粗心老师的“小秘密”也很快被观察敏锐的同学们发现。
The trickiest problem is that some careless teachers "little secrets" are quickly discovered by observant students.
。
.
而自己珍藏的关注列表，也说不好会惨遭暴露：。
And their own treasured list of concerns, also said that will be exposed:.
虽说看热闹不嫌事大的同学可不少，但大多数直播也都能安安稳稳的进行。
Although it is not unusual to see lively students can be many, but most of the live broadcast can also be carried out quietly.
当然，体育老师除外。
Except for PE teachers, of course.
。
.
学校一向讲究德智体美全面发展，在疫情当头的情况下，身体素质更是要加紧锻炼。
School has always stressed the comprehensive development of moral, intellectual and physical beauty, in the face of the epidemic situation, physical quality should be intensified exercise.
所以体育老师也得加入直播上课的大潮之中。
So physical education teachers have to join the tide of live lessons.
而这也就让不少老师遭遇了“直播跑步跳操，惨遭围观”的羞耻情况。
And this also let a lot of teachers encountered "live running jump, tragically watched" shame situation.
。
.
示范动作也变成了一场对自尊心的考验：。
The demonstration turned into a test of self-esteem.
即便平时是浪里白条的游泳教师，这回也免不了当岸上一条虫。
Even though he is a swimming teacher with white stripes, he is inevitably a worm on the shore.
。
.
不过“惨遭围观”同样是双向的。
But being on the sidelines is also a two-way street.
体育老师们一声令下也可以尽享“万孩朝拜”的快感：。
Physical education teachers can also enjoy the "all children worship" under the command of the pleasure:
所以在这场网络教学图中，最受重创的也只有生物老师了。
So in this network teaching diagram, the hardest hit also only biology teacher.
。
.
惨点的物理老师可能也会被波及：。
The tragic physics teacher may also be affected:
至于之前我们最期待的“给老师刷礼物”环节，今天在直播网站上倒也能看见不少。
As for the "Brush Gifts for Teachers" link, we can see a lot on the live website today.
只不过很多老师都搞不懂礼物究竟是啥，说起来顶多也就是当个玩笑——大部分老师都能恪守职责，禁止学生刷礼物。
It's just that many teachers don't understand what a gift is, and at best it's a joke -- most teachers stick to their responsibilities and forbid students from brushing gifts.
。
.
当然，不排除有开网络课堂的老师谢起礼物来格外上道：。
Of course, do not exclude the network of classroom teachers thank the gift to the extra way:.
综上所述，在克服种种困难的情况下，无数艰难的老师还是一如既往地给学生们讲完了一堂堂课，尽管并不容易。
To sum up, in spite of all the difficulties, the numerous difficult teachers still gave the students a lecture, even though it was not easy.
。
.
当然，这期间学生的心态也是奔溃的。
Of course, the students' mentality during this period is also routed.
。
.
自网课宣布开启之后，大部分学生都开始叫苦连天——尤其是他们看到自己被塞满的课程表之后：。
Most students began to yell after the internet session was announced - especially after they saw their lesson plans stuffed up.
特别是部分学生即使早已瘫软在家，但还是逃脱不了“视频打卡”的魔爪。
Especially some students have been paralyzed at home, but still can not escape the "video card printing" of the claws.
。
.
此前学生们对“网络上课”有着一副美好的幻想——以为可以随便开小差，或者边听课边干点别的。
Previously, students had a wonderful fantasy of taking classes online -- thinking they could desert or do something else while they listened.
但高度发的直播科技如今已经把他们的幻想击碎：现在部分网课软件已经支持老师随时监控摄像头前的孩子或是电脑屏幕了。
But highly-broadcast technology has now shattered their illusions: some Web-based software now allows teachers to monitor children or computer screens at any time.
。
.
而当代学生目前最恐惧的一句话，恐怕也从“你来黑板写下答案”变成了“老师邀请你上麦发言”。
One of the most frightening things students have to say at the moment is that they have changed from "you write the answer on the blackboard" to "the teacher invites you to talk about it."
。
.
为了应对这一挑战，学生们也开始急中生智了起来，比如有人选择用照片制作影分身。
In response to this challenge, students have also come up with ideas, such as someone opting to make a photo-split.
。
.
也有前辈为后人总结出了宝贵的经验：装网络卡顿逃避点名。
There are also previous generations for the future summed up the valuable experience: playing the network card ton to avoid the roll call.
。
.
不过脑子迟钝的还是难逃一劫。
But the brain is still slow to escape.
。
.
在发现仍然逃脱不了上课之后，学生们又开始发挥自己的捣蛋天性，自娱自乐了起来。
After discovering that they still couldn't get away from class, the students began to play their trick-or-treat nature and amuse themselves.
比如现在，“刷赞”俨然成为了当今扰乱课堂秩序最时髦的手段。
Now, for example, "praise" has become the most fashionable means of disrupting classroom order.
很多老师抱怨：上课50分钟，结果拿了几万赞，也不知道学生是不是在听讲。
Many teachers complain that they get tens of thousands of compliments after 50 minutes of class and don't know if the students are listening.
。
.
当然这类捣蛋的同学下场也都不太好。
Of course, this kind of troublesome students are not good results.
例如有人在网课上刷火箭，结果惨遭老师批评——B站上一位同学录屏给老师刷火箭，被老师发现后“赠送了45套题”。
One student painted a rocket on the net and was criticized by his teacher. A classmate of B stood on the screen and brushed the rocket for the teacher.
。
.
而以往的“在课桌底下偷偷看手机”，也逐渐演变成了现在的“分屏”打游戏。
In the past, "secretly under the desk to see the mobile phone," has gradually evolved into the current "split screen" game.
。
.
来源：B站@硬币是个好东东。
Source: Station B @ Coin is a good idea.
但脑子不灵光的，该抓还是要被抓。
But the brain is not bright, should be caught or arrested.
。
.
课堂转移到网络之后，大部分同学都发现上课该有的环节还是一个不落。
Classroom transfer to the network, most students have found that there should be a link in class or not.
拖堂吃不上午饭这种事，上网课也跑不了，但至少同学们能通过改名等小手段来抱怨一下。
The towing hall does not have lunch this kind of thing, the net class also cannot run, but at least schoolmates can complain through the change of name and so on.
。
.
像是“走错教室”这种问题，即使到了直播平台上也会发生：。
Such problems as "going to the wrong classroom" can occur even on a live broadcast platform.
除此之外，每天的作业倒也仍然不少。
Besides, there is still a lot of homework every day.
也不排除生气的老师留作业时“话里有话”：。
Also does not rule out the angry teacher leaves homework when "the words have words":.
还有的同学本想私聊小伙伴抱怨上课无聊，结果不小心发到公屏——像极了传小纸条被老师逮到。
Some students would like to chat with small partners to complain about boring classes, the result accidentally sent to the public screen - like a little note was arrested by the teacher.
。
.
就连上课偷偷嗦面被发现这种传统艺能也被完美复刻。
Even the traditional art of secretly wordy faces in class is perfectly etched.
。
.
当然，最惨的还是这位：。
Of course, the worst is still this:.
当然，这些都是“大孩子”们的烦恼，有些年龄偏低的小朋友碰到网课更是不知所措。
Of course, these are the "older children" of the annoyance, some of the younger children encountered the network lessons are more at a loss.
这位小朋友恐怕还在疑惑老师为啥要“叫妈妈”。
The little friend is still wondering why the teacher should call his mother.
。
.
诸如此类的问题还有不少，此外老师的“拖堂”“留作业”倒是样样俱全，让同学们面对着手机电脑傻了眼。
There are many such problems, in addition to the teacher's "tug" "homework" is everything, let students face the mobile phone computer dumbfounded.
他们现在唯一能祈祷的，也只有老师掉线了。
The only thing they can pray for now is for the teacher to fall off the line.
。
.
网上课堂这一周走来，上述的这些“笑料”倒真是不少。
This week comes online classroom, the above-mentioned "laughter" is really a lot.
当传统的课堂和直播并行，也让网上教学这一事件变得趣味横生了起来，并在这段艰难的日子里给大家添了些许难得的乐趣。
While traditional classes run in parallel with live broadcasts, it also makes the online teaching event interesting and gives us a little bit of fun in this difficult time.
但仍有一些事情，值得我们牢记与履行。
But there are still some things that we should remember and carry out.
。
.
最近是“网络上课”这个话题大火的日子，不少网友也随之涌进了老师和学生们的小课堂，或多或少会有一些骚乱。
Recently, the topic of "Internet classes" the day of fire, many netizens also poured into the teachers and students small class, more or less there will be some disturbance.
而一些老师会在直播间挂上“关爱花朵”的标语，争吵也就逐渐减少了。
And some teachers put "love flowers" in the studio, and the squabble gradually diminished.
。
.
与此同时，也有不少明显不是学生的网友也跟着上起了课，刷起了回答。
At the same time, there are a lot of obviously non-student netizens also followed the class, brush up the answer.
也有网友怀着对学生时代的怀念，想再次体验上课的感觉，便在近日圆了念想。
There are also netizens with the student time with nostalgia, want to experience the feeling of class again, then in recent days full thought.
这都是值得欣慰的景象，我们也在此呼吁大家，尽量不要给老师的教学添加更多的负担。
This is a welcome sight, and we appeal to you to try not to overburden teachers' teaching.
这些克服条件限制，相隔遥远却仍然要给孩子们上一堂课的老师，值得我们尊敬。
Those teachers who overcome the constraints of distance and still give their children a lesson deserve our respect.
。
.
江西的一位寥老师在700公里外的大山里，寒冷中，给同学们直播讲课：。
A Solitary teacher in Jiangxi Province, 700 kilometers away in the mountains, cold, to the students live lectures:.
贵州的邓老师上课时为了找信号，只能爬到山顶，戴上头灯。
In order to find the signal, Guizhou Deng had to climb to the top of the mountain and put on headlights.
。
.
类似的新闻仍然有不少。
There is still plenty of similar news.
大部分老师的备课本已不易，但由于不熟悉电子产品，又给工作多添了一些麻烦。
Most teachers are not easy to prepare for classes, but because of unfamiliar with electronic products, the work has added some trouble.
但师德不会被疫情掩埋，知识也能通过网络传递。
But ethics is not buried by disease, and knowledge can be transmitted over the Internet.
。
.

与此同时，也有学生跑到屋顶，连邻居的wifi，只为上一堂网课，实现自己的“浙大梦”。
At the same time, some students ran to the roof, even the neighbor's Wifi, just for a lesson, to realize their "Zhejiang dream."
。
.
疫情虽险，学习不止。
Although the epidemic is dangerous, learning is not limited.
希望如今“直播上课”的情景，只是未来成功学子们回忆中一个有趣的插曲。
Hopefully, the "live class" scene now is just an interesting episode in the memory of future successful students.
