17年来，国家对野生动物的保护和销售不断加严。
Over the past 17 years, the state has been tightening the protection and marketing of wildlife.
不过，监管困难重重，非法捕猎和销售多年未禁，风险仍存。
However, regulation is difficult and the risks of illegal hunting and marketing remain unchecked for many years.
全文4285字，阅读约需8分钟腊月二十七这天，林木决定放弃春节回老家打竹鼠吃。
Full text 4285 words, reading about 8 minutes on 27 December, tree decided to give up the Spring Festival back home to eat bamboo rats.
前一晚，一则“武汉新型冠状病毒很可能来自野生动物”的信息，多次在他手机屏幕弹窗出现。
The night before, a "new Wuhan coronavirus is likely to come from wild animals" message, appeared in his mobile phone screen bullet window several times.
作出以上论断的，是国家卫健委高级别专家组组长、中国工程院院士钟南山。
Make the above judgement, is the high-level expert group leader of the Chinese Academy of Engineering Zhong Nan Shan.
钟南山在接受央视连线时说，此次肺炎疫情的病原很大可能来自野生动物，“比如竹鼠”。
In an interview with CCTV, Zhong Nan-shan said the cause of the outbreak was likely to come from wild animals, such as bamboo mice.
这起可能由野生动物引发的新疫情迅速蔓延，截至21日晚，各地确诊新型冠状病毒肺炎已超300例。
This may be a new outbreak of wild animals rapidly spread, as of the evening of 21, the new coronavirus pneumonia has been diagnosed in more than 300 cases.
一些人很自然地回想起17年前的SARS，同样因野生动物引发。
Some people naturally recall SARS 17 years ago, also caused by wild animals.
17年来，国家对野生动物的保护和销售不断加严。
Over the past 17 years, the state has been tightening the protection and marketing of wildlife.
不过，监管困难重重，非法捕猎和销售多年未禁，风险仍存。
However, regulation is difficult and the risks of illegal hunting and marketing remain unchecked for many years.
━━━━━摆上餐桌的竹鼠在钟南山将“竹鼠”和新型冠状病毒联系起来之前，在广州工作的林木对于回清远老家过年充满期待，其中包括摆上餐桌的各种野味。
2006-03-10 09: 27: 36 Bamboo Rats on the Table Before Zhong Nan Shan linked the "bamboo rat" to the new coronavirus, the trees working in Guangzhou were looking forward to the Lunar New Year back to their hometown of Qingyuan.
野味是广东人的心头爱。
Game is the love of Guangdong people.
有人形容广东人什么都爱吃，尤其是天上飞的、地上跑的、水里游的。
Some people describe Cantonese love to eat anything, especially the sky flying, running on the ground, swimming in the water.
林木专门研究过这个问题。
Trees have specialized in this subject.
广东依山傍水，还临海，物资丰富，靠山吃山、靠水吃水，广东人偏爱原汁原味。
Guangdong Yishanbangshui, also adjacent to the sea, rich in materials, rely on mountains, water draught, Guandong people prefer original flavor.
林木说，相比猪、牛、羊、鱼，野味的口感更原始纯正，没有掺杂饲料和激素，“在口感和心理上，感觉纯天然、无污染。
Compared with pigs, cows, sheep and fish, game tastes more pristine, free of forage and hormones, and "feels natural and non-polluting on the palate and psychologically," Wood said.
”在各式野味中，林木偏好竹鼠。
Among all kinds of game, forest trees prefer bamboo mice.
竹鼠因吃竹而得名，原本属珍贵野生动物，全世界共有3属6种。
Bamboo is named for eating bamboo, which is originally a precious wildlife, there are 3 genera 6 species.
在我国，主要分布在南方地区。
In our country, it is mainly distributed in the south.
部分竹鼠濒临灭绝或极为少见，例如花白竹鼠，属于保护动物。
Some of them are endangered or rare, such as white-white bamboo mice, which are protected animals.
不过，由于具有较高的经济价值，我国已实现竹鼠规模化养殖。
However, due to its high economic value, China has achieved large-scale bamboo and mouse farming.
以前吃竹鼠，林木一般都和朋友上山去捕。
I used to eat bamboo mice, trees and friends generally go up to the mountains to catch.
如今常年在外工作，无暇打竹鼠，只有过年才偶尔吃到。
Working out all the year round, no time to hit bamboo mice, only the New Year only occasionally eat.
几天前，妈妈跟林木说，过年了，专门备了一些竹鼠、野兔和蛇，等他回家一起吃。
A few days ago, my mother told the tree, Spring Festival, specially prepared some bamboo mice, rabbits and snakes, wait for him to eat together.
21日下午，林木给妈妈打电话说，野味别做了，原本自己过年回家打竹鼠，他也放弃了。
On the afternoon of the 21st, the tree called his mother to say that the game did not do, originally come home to hunt bamboo mice, he also gave up.
距离这通电话数小时前，广东发布春节消费提示，呼吁市民不食用野生动物，避免接触不明来源的病菌。
Hours before the call, Guangdong issued a Spring Festival consumption reminder urging people not to eat wild animals, to avoid contact with unknown sources of bacteria.
就在前一晚，钟南山院士表示，此次武汉新型冠状病毒很大可能来自野生动物，比如竹鼠等。
Just the night before, Academician Zhong Nan Shan said the new Wuhan coronavirus could come from wild animals, such as bamboo mice.
而这些野生动物，很大可能来自此次肺炎疫情的最初暴发地，武汉华南海鲜市场。
And these wild animals, very likely from the original outbreak of pneumonia, Wuhan South China seafood market.
多方信息显示，华南海鲜市场不仅卖海鲜，也卖“野味儿”。
Multiple sources indicate that the South China seafood market sells not only seafood, but also "game".
有网友发文称，华南海鲜市场有野鸡、蛇、土拨鼠等动物宰杀出售。
Some netizens said that the South China seafood market has pheasants, snakes, marmots and other animals slaughtered and sold.
据武汉市市场监管局2019年9月25日发布的野生动物市场专项整治行动消息，华南海鲜批发市场有近8家商户售卖野生动物，包括虎斑蛙、蛇、刺猬等。
According to the report issued by Wuhan Municipal Market Supervisory Authority on September 25, 2019, there are nearly eight shops selling wild animals, including tiger frog, snake and hedgehog, at the wholesale seafood market in South China.
在当天的行动中，执法人员逐一检查了这些商户的野生动物经营许可审批文件、营业许可证，并严禁其经营未获审批的野生动物。
During the day-to-day operation, law enforcement officials inspected the wildlife license approval documents, business licenses and strictly prohibited the business of wild animals that had not been approved.
不过，当天未发现违法经营行为。
However, no illegal operations were detected on that day.
网传的武汉华南海鲜市场“大众畜牧野味”价目表。
Wuhan South China seafood market "popular livestock game" price list.
━━━━━明卖的野味听说这个卷入舆论和监管漩涡的市场卖竹鼠，林木并不稀奇。
Streams in the Desert (July 23 - Aug. 23) It is not uncommon to hear that this market involved in the whirlpool of opinion and regulation is selling bamboo mice.
1月21日，新京报记者来到华南海鲜市场，此前因售卖多种野味备受争议的“大众畜牧野味”商铺，目前已闭店。
A reporter from the Beijing News came to the South China Seafood Market on January 21 after closing a controversial "popular livestock game" shop selling a variety of game.
网传这家大众畜牧野味的菜单上，品名上百种，包括竹鼠、狗狸獾、猪狸獾、果子狸、狐狸、树熊、孔雀、大雁等，均可活杀现宰，速冻冰鲜，送货上门。
There are hundreds of names on the menu of popular animal husbandry and game, including bamboo rat, beaver badger, beaver badger, beaver, fox, koala, peacock, wild goose, etc., all can be killed alive, frozen cold, door-to-door.
市场一名商铺老板说，自己此前曾到过“大众畜牧”店中，店里以售卖羊肉等常见肉类为主。
One shop owner said he had been to "popular livestock" stores, which sell mutton and other common meat.
另有一名商铺老板说，市场休业前，“大众畜牧”一直正常营业，“这家店确实售卖野味。
Another shopkeeper said Volkswagen remained open until the market was closed. "The store does sell game.
”另一位李姓老板透露，市场售卖野生动物的摊位，主要集中在西区中部一条长廊，“偷着卖那多少是有的。
Another owner, Li, said the market stalls selling wild animals were concentrated in a corridor in central West End, "and there were some that were stolen and sold.
”华南海鲜市场的脏乱差，长期被诟病。
The mess in the South China seafood market has long been criticized.
据悉，华南海鲜市场是武汉最大的海鲜批发市场，批零兼营，是武汉市民和酒店餐馆采购海鲜和野味的主要市场。
It is reported that South China Seafood Market is Wuhan's largest wholesale seafood market, approved part-time, Wuhan City and hotel restaurants purchase seafood and game main market.
卫星地图显示，市场距离汉口火车站不足一公里，是武汉市人流最密集的区域之一。
Satellite map shows that the market is less than a kilometer away from Hankou Railway Station, Wuhan City is one of the most densely populated areas.
周边有多家快捷酒店，道路南侧紧邻两个大型商超、多个住宅区，以及医院、学校等人流密集场所。
There are a number of fast-track hotels, the south side of the road adjacent to two large supermarkets, a number of residential areas, as well as hospitals, schools and other densely populated places.
天眼查信息显示，武汉华南海鲜市场有限公司成立于2005年，主营业务为市场物业管理、停车场经营；水产品、初级农产品的批发兼零售；食品销售。
The day-eye information shows that Wuhan South China Seafood Market Co., Ltd. was established in 2005, the main business for the market property management, car park operations; aquatic products, agricultural products wholesale and retail; food sales.
市场位于武汉市江汉区发展大道207号，据媒体报道，这里东、西两个区域共有28条街，共计约有650余个摊位，从业人员1500余人。
The market is located at 207 Jianghan District Development Avenue in Wuhan City. According to media reports, there are 28 streets in East and West China, with a total of about 650 stalls and more than 1,500 employees.
“去过几次，污水横流，苍蝇蛮多”，有网友在论坛中这样投诉。
"Several times, the sewage flow, flies quite a lot," some netizens in the forum such a complaint.
2017年，还有网友就是否有拆迁计划在《领导留言板》提问，江汉区委督查室回应称，华南海鲜市场目前暂未列入江汉区“十三五”（2016-2020年）“三旧”改造规划范围。
In 2017, there were also netizens on whether there is a demolition plan in the "leadership message board", the Jianghan District Party Supervision Office responded that the South China seafood market is not currently included in the "13th Five-Year Plan" (2016-2020) in the Jianghan region.
今年1月1日，武汉市江汉区市场监督管理局、武汉市江汉区卫生健康局联合发布公告，对华南海鲜批发市场实行休市，进行环境卫生整治，开市时间另行通知。
On January 1 this year, the Wuhan Municipal Jianghan District Market Supervision Bureau and Wuhan Jianghan District Health Bureau jointly issued a notice announcing that the South China Seafood Wholesale Market would be closed for environmental hygiene improvement until further notice.
1月21日，武汉市宣布继续加大华南海鲜批发市场休市后管控力度，24小时管控市场及其周边出入口。
On January 21, Wuhan announced that it would continue to strengthen post-market controls at the South China Seafood Wholesale Market, regulating the market and its surrounding outlets on a 24-hour basis.

摄影/新京报记者许雯━━━━━SARS的前车之鉴野生动物可能带来的又一次疫情，将人们的记忆拉到17年前的SARS。
Photo / Xinhua News Reporter Xu Wen: Another outbreak of wild animals may have brought back memories of SARS 17 years ago.
林木的家，紧挨着中山大学附属第三医院。
Forest home, next to Zhongshan University attached to the third hospital.
2002年底，全球首例SARS病人就在该医院被确诊。
At the end of 2002, the world's first case of SARS was diagnosed at the hospital.
“一开始不以为然，后来快速蔓延并出现死亡病例，都陷入恐慌。
"It didn't look good at first, but then it spread quickly and there were deaths and there was panic.
”林木回忆，当时传言中能预防非典的白醋、盐和板蓝根瞬间被疯抢，价格翻了几十倍不说，还全线断货。
Forest memories, rumored to be able to prevent SARS white vinegar, salt and Banlangen were seized in an instant, prices increased dozens of times, and all the line.
他家在广州，工作在深圳，每天乘高铁通勤。
His family lives in Guangzhou, works in Shenzhen and commutes to Shenzhen by high-speed rail every day.
他清晰记得，当时在进站口、单位门口，都要测体温。
He remembered clearly that he had to take his temperature at the entrance to the station and at the gate of the unit.
如果身边有人发烧，大家便一起劝他赶紧去医院检测。
If someone has a fever around him, everyone will advise him to go to the hospital quickly.
2002年年底，在我国广东首次爆发的SARS，是本世纪初最严重的一次传染病，5个月内传播到全球27个国家和地区，造成了8000人感染，死亡病例接近800人。
At the end of 2002, the first outbreak of SARS in Guangdong Province in China was the most serious infectious disease of the turn of the century, spreading to 27 countries and regions around the world in five months, causing 8,000 infections and nearly 800 deaths.
一开始，医学界认为SARS是从果子狸而来。
At first, the medical community thought SARS came from civet beavers.
广东2004年年初发布一条禁令，全面捕杀野生动物市场的果子狸，取缔野生动物交易，关闭野生动物市场。
Guangdong issued a ban in early 2004 to kill all beavers in wildlife markets, ban wildlife trading and close wildlife markets.
专家说，这个政策对控制SARS后期传播起了非常关键的作用，在那之后，广东再没有出现SARS新增病例。
Experts say the policy has played a key role in controlling the spread of SARS later in life, after which there have been no new cases of SARS in Guangdong.
到后来，中科院武汉病毒研究所石正丽团队多年跟踪研究发现，果子狸只是SARS冠状病毒的中间宿主，真正源头是云南省一些岩洞里的蝙蝠。
Later, Shi Zhengli's team at the Wuhan Institute of Virus of the Chinese Academy of Sciences followed up for years and found that civet beavers are only the intermediate hosts of the SARS coronavirus. The real source is bats in some caves in Yunnan Province.
SARS病毒是经过几个蝙蝠体内SARS样冠状病毒重组而来，偶然情况下感染了果子狸，再传染给人。
The SARS virus has been recombinant in several bats from the SARS-like coronavirus and has accidentally infected a civet and passed it on to humans.
为何两次严重疫情的新型病毒，都指向野生动物？此次发现的新型冠状病毒与SARS同为冠状病毒。
Why are the two new coronavirus outbreaks directed at wild animals? The new coronavirus was found to be the same coronavirus as SARS.
北京大学医学部病原生物学系教授、博士生导师彭宜红接受采访时表示，野生动物是冠状病毒的常见宿主。
Wild animals are common hosts of coronavirus, said Peng Yehong, a professor in the Department of Pathogenic Biology at Peking University's Department of Medicine.
这类病原通常由蝙蝠等野生动物传染给哺乳动物，哺乳动物传染给人类。
Such pathogens are usually transmitted to mammals by wild animals such as bats and mammals to humans.
携带病原体的动物分泌物，可经呼吸道黏膜进入人体。
Animal secretions that carry pathogens can enter the body through the respiratory mucosa.
比如，手上沾染了病原体，再去摸鼻子、揉眼睛，病毒都可以在黏膜细胞上大量增殖而进入体内发病。
For example, hands contaminated with pathogens, to touch the nose, rub eyes, the virus can proliferate on mucous cell and enter the body disease.
果壳科普作家张博然分析，野生动物远居野外，不常与人类接触，身上携带的细菌和病毒研究程度远不如人类传染病充分，一旦被感染，很难迅速找到治疗方案。
Wild animals live in the wild, rarely come into contact with humans, carry far less bacteria and viruses on their bodies than do infectious diseases in humans, and it is difficult to find a cure quickly once infected, Zhang Bo-ran, a science writer, said.
一旦具备传染性，更是难以控制。
Once infectious, it is more difficult to control.
“病毒还存在变异的可能。
"The virus has the potential to mutate.
一些本寄居在动物身上的病毒在变异之后也会寄居在人类身上，同样难以短时间内破解。
Some of the viruses that inhabit animals mutate to inhabit humans, too, and are hard to crack in a short time.
”张博然指出，在传染性方面，不仅食用野生动物存在风险，接触过野生动物的人可能也会被传染。
Zhang noted that, in terms of infectious diseases, not only are there risks from eating wild animals, but people who have come into contact with them may also be infected.
“传染病的风险，主要就是靠近和接触，包括捕捉和出售，逛野味市场，买回去拔毛加工之类的流程。
"The risk of an infectious disease is primarily a process of proximity and contact, including catching and selling, visiting game markets, buying back and plucking."
”“建议大家尽量不要食用野生动物，官方也要加强宣传食用野生动物的危害。
"We advise people to try not to eat wild animals. Officials should also step up publicity about the dangers of eating wild animals.
”张博然说。
"said Zhang.
眼下，只有找到宿主动物，并彻底进行源头整治，才能大概率防止疫情发生。
At the moment, it is only by finding the host animal and carrying out a thorough source remediation that it is possible to prevent the outbreak.
昨日，研究者最新进展显示，武汉新型冠状病毒与SARS及SARS样冠状病毒群在进化上非常“亲密”，拥有共同的外类群，可以推断它们的共同祖先是一类寄生于蝙蝠的冠状病毒。
Wuhan coronavirus has evolved "intimately" with the SARS and SARS-like coronavirus cohort, with a common exogroup that presumably shared a common ancestor, a coronavirus parasitic to bats, researchers said yesterday.
研究者推测武汉新型冠状病毒的原生宿主为蝙蝠，不过从蝙蝠到人可能还存在更多的中间宿主。
The researchers speculate that the original host of Wuhan's new coronavirus is a bat, although there may be more intermediate hosts from bats to humans.
━━━━━野味文化暗网今年元旦期间，林木回了趟家，约好了三五朋友，打算过年一起上山打竹鼠。
Streams in the New Year This New Year's Day, the trees back home, made a date with five friends, planning to go up to the mountains and bamboo mice together.
有人说目前野外竹鼠数量极少，林木却说，只要掌握了方法，一个小时就能打到数十只。
Some people say that the number of bamboo rats in the wild is very small, but the trees said that as long as the method, can hit dozens of an hour.
“我们一般傍晚先上山摸底，找好竹鼠的洞，洞口放一些诱饵和老鼠夹。
"We usually go up to the bottom of the mountain in the evening to find the hole and put some bait and mousetrap.
天一黑，竹鼠全出来了。
When it was dark, the mice came out.
”林木说，类似华南海鲜城中的野味店，岭南地区还有不少。
"Forest said, similar to the South China Sea fresh city in the game shop, Lingnan area there are many.
野味究竟能否交易贩卖？根据我国《陆生野生动物保护实施条例》，经营利用非国家重点保护野生动物或者其产品的，应当向工商行政管理部门申请登记注册，取得相关野生动物经营利用许可审批文件。
In accordance with the Implementation Regulations on the Protection of Wild Animals on Land, any person handling wildlife or its products under special non-state protection shall apply for registration with the administrative department for industry and commerce and obtain relevant license approval documents for wildlife business operation.
此外，暹罗鳄、虎纹蛙等9种人工繁育技术成熟稳定的国家重点保护野生动物也可以凭专用标识出售、购买。
In addition, 9 kinds of wild animals with mature and stable artificial breeding techniques, such as alligator and tiger stripe, can also be sold and purchased with special marks.
“也就是说，从业者首先必须取得相关的售卖资格许可，同时售卖的必须是人工繁育的野生动物物种。
"In other words, the operator must first obtain a relevant license to sell and must sell the species of wild animals that have been bred.
”中国野生动物保护协会一名工作人员说。
"said a staff member of the China Wildlife Conservation Association.
该工作人员坦言，目前对野生动物经营的监管依然存在很大难度，“被售卖的野生动物来源很难确定，是野生的还是人工繁育的，来源只有经营者自己清楚。
The official admitted that current regulation of wildlife operations remains a challenge and that "the source of wildlife sold is difficult to determine, wild or artificial, and the source is known only to the operator."
”据他分析，如果偷着卖，渠道来源就存疑，有可能存在非法猎捕等违法违规行为。
According to his analysis, if the sale is stolen, the source of the source of suspicion, there may be illegal hunting and other illegal violations.
有些商家可能存在没有办理相关经营利用许可证和养殖许可证的违规行为，售卖野生动物是否经过正规的检疫系统检测，是否有相关卫生检疫部门的许可，也无法得知。
Some businesses may be operating without the relevant operating license and breeding license violations, whether the sale of wild animals by the regular quarantine system testing, whether the relevant health and quarantine departments have permission, nor can be known.
显而易见，这些都将加剧风险。
Clearly, these risks will be exacerbated.
长期来，国家相关部门对破坏野生动物资源的行为开展集中打击。
For a long time, the relevant state departments have launched a concentrated strike against the destruction of wildlife resources.
数据显示，2017年春季，全国森林公安机关开展了为期70天的“利剑行动”，集中打击、侦破了一大批破坏森林和野生动物资源的大案要案。
In the spring of 2017, the country's forest public security organs launched a 70-day "Operation Sharp Sword," concentrating on cracking down on a large number of major cases involving the destruction of forests and wildlife resources.
行动期间，收缴野生动物10万余头（只），2018年该行动收缴野生动物12万余头。
During the operation, more than 100,000 wild animals were collected, and in 2018 the operation collected more than 120,000 wild animals.
为何屡禁不止？原国家林业局2017年曾分析认为，高额利润驱使野生动物案件依然高发。
A 2017 analysis by the former State Forestry Administration concluded that high profits were driving wildlife crime rates.
少数公众“野味文化”根深蒂固，致使需求不断加大，非法市场暗自形成。
A few public "game culture" is deep-rooted, resulting in growing demand, illegal market formation.
另外，由于违法分子作案地点不固定、作案时间短，林政执法部门难以及时打击，处罚力度低，使得不法分子心存侥幸。
In addition, due to the irregular location of the perpetrators, a short time, forest law enforcement departments are difficult to combat, punishment is low, so that the illegal elements are lucky.
象牙、犀牛角等价格昂贵的野生动物制品受到追捧，非法收购、出售国家重点保护珍贵、濒危野生动物制品案件有所增加。
Expensive wildlife products such as ivory and rhinoceros horn have been sought after, and cases of illegal purchase and sale of precious and endangered wildlife products under special state protection have increased.
1月21日下午，广东举行首场肺炎疫情发布会，明确提出，将严管严控野生动物市场，坚决取缔违法售卖野生动物行为。
In the afternoon of January 21, Guangdong held its first pneumonia briefing and made it clear that it would strictly control the wildlife market and resolutely crack down on illegal wildlife sales.
林木感觉，经历过SARS，一部分广东人可能对野味不那么热衷了，学会与野生动物保持距离，但很多人仍以食野味为乐趣，不愿轻易改变饮食习惯。
Trees feel that having experienced SARS, some Cantonese may be less enthusiastic about game and learn to keep away from wildlife, but many people still enjoy eating game and are reluctant to change their eating habits easily.
昨晚，林木的朋友又给他打来电话，问他过年是否回家一起打竹鼠。
Last night, a friend of the tree called him again and asked him if he would come home to hunt bamboo mice for the New Year.
得知林木因肺炎疫情而放弃后，朋友有些诧异，笑着问，“吃这么多年不也没事儿？”━━━━━三部门：对未经检疫合格的野生动物，一律严禁进入市场据国家林业和草原局官博消息，1月21日，国家市场监管总局、农业农村部、国家林业和草原局下发《关于加强野生动物市场监管。
After learning that trees had given up due to pneumonia, the friend asked with a smile, All animals that have not been quarantined are strictly prohibited from entering the market.On January 21, the State Administration of Market Supervision, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs and the State Forestry and Grassland Administration issued the Regulation on Strengthening Wildlife Markets.
积极做好疫情防控工作的紧急通知》，要求各地林草、农业农村和市场监管部门依照《中华人民共和国野生动物保护法》规定和职责分工，突出饲养、繁育、运输、出售、购买等环节，加强检验检疫力度。
The Ministry of Commerce shall, in accordance with the provisions of the Wild Animals Protection Law of the People's Republic of China and the division of responsibilities, make special efforts in raising, breeding, transporting, selling and purchasing, and strengthen inspection and quarantine.
对未经检疫合格的野生动物，一律严禁进入市场。
All wild animals that fail to pass quarantine are strictly prohibited from entering the market.
突出农贸市场、超市、餐饮等重点场所以及网站，开展联合检查，加强隐患排查，严厉打击野生动物违法违规交易，涉嫌犯罪的，及时移送司法机关。
