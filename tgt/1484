物资抵达武汉只是第一步，如何将这些物资及时、有效、尽量低损耗地分发给有需要的人，更是难题文|《财经》记者刘以秦 编辑|谢丽容2月16日上午10点，12辆货车抵达武汉武东收费站，他们连夜从江西赣州赶来，载着30万斤蔬菜，捐献给武汉疫区，这些蔬菜是赣州市下属的信丰县和龙南县的农民自发捐赠。
The arrival of the materials in Wuhan is only the first step. How to distribute them to those in need in a timely, efficient and low-cost manner is a first step. At 10: 00 a.m. on February 16, 12 lorries arrived at Wuhan Wudong toll booth.
志愿者王琛负责这一次的捐献对接，几天前，他曾成功组织过一次蔬菜捐赠，来自赣州的1.5万斤蔬菜被捐赠给了武汉的环卫工人。
Volunteers Wang Chen is in charge of the donation docking, a few days ago, he successfully organized a vegetable donation from Ganzhou, 15000 pounds of vegetables were donated to sanitation workers in Wuhan.
武汉公交司机与货车司机对接所有的物资捐赠都要通过政府，王琛需要先联系政府，并拿到通行证，随后还要联合各个有需要的部门和组织。
Wuhan bus drivers and truck drivers docked all material donations through the government, Wang Chen needs to contact the government, get a pass, and then join with various departments and organizations in need.
此前，武汉市一医院在社交平台上发布信息称该院食物告急，称“工作人员正在饿着肚子上战场”。
Earlier, a hospital in Wuhan announced on a social platform that the hospital food emergency, said "staff are hungry to go to the battlefield."
因此，王琛这次募捐到的蔬菜物资中的大部分，都定向捐赠给了医院。
Therefore, Wang Chen this collection of vegetable materials, most of the targeted donations to the hospital.
此外，王琛还联系了武汉大学中南医院以及同济医院，以及对蔬菜需求量大的方舱医院，剩下的一部分捐赠给有物资困难的社区。
Wang also contacted Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital and Tongji Hospital, as well as the large demand for vegetables, and donated the rest to communities in need.
武汉仍然处于封城状态，外地货车司机如果进入武汉，返程就成问题，为此，社区工作人员帮忙联系了武汉公交公司，派出12名公交司机志愿者，来高速路口代替货车司机将货物转运至各个接收点。
Wuhan is still in a state of closure, the return of non-local truckers into Wuhan, the return of the problem, community workers to help contact Wuhan Public Transport Company, sent 12 bus drivers volunteers to the high-speed junction to replace truck drivers to transfer goods to the various receiving points.
10点30分，操着武汉口音的公交司机们与货车司机们完成1对1对接，了解每一辆货车的操作方式，准备出发。
At 10: 30, Wuhan-accented bus drivers and truck drivers to complete a 1-to-1 docking, understand how each truck operates, ready to start.
他们开来了一辆公交车，消毒后，供货车司机们休息、等待。
They brought a bus, disinfected, for the truck drivers to rest and wait.
社区的工作人员提供了方便面、面包和热水。
Community workers provided instant noodles, bread and hot water.
落实这些交接细节琐碎而复杂，王琛为此忙碌了好几天。
Implementation of these handover details is trivial and complex, Wang Chen busy for several days.
从武东高速路口出发，才只是物资落实的第一步。
Departure from the Wuhan expressway junction is only the first step in the material implementation.
医院：物资混乱易造成浪费王琛先带着一辆货车赶往位于武昌区的武汉大学中南医院，这也是此次疫情的武汉定点医院之一。
Hospital: chaotic materials easy to waste Wang Chen with a lorry to Wuhan University in Wuchang District Zhongnan Hospital, which is one of the Wuhan Ding Hospital.
这批物资中，有5000斤蔬菜定向捐给中南医院。
Five thousand pounds of vegetables were earmarked for donation to the South China Hospital.
中南医院仅医护人员就有几千名，5000斤蔬菜也就是一天的消耗量，出发前一天，王琛已经和医院联系好了接货事宜，但当货车到达时，医院的捐赠物资负责人姜主任却表示，他们已经忙不过来了。
The day before the trip, Wang Chen had contacted the hospital to pick up the goods, but when the van arrived, Jiang, the hospital's donation director, said they were overwhelmed.
姜主任提到，2月14日一天，来了几十辆货车，运来捐赠的物资，从医院里面一直排队排到了马路上，医院里的工作人员忙到凌晨1点，才全部搬运完毕。
Jiang noted that on February 14, dozens of trucks arrived and donated goods arrived, lined up from inside the hospital and lined up on the street.
“蔬菜如果一次性来太多，容易浪费。
"Vegetables are easy to waste if they come in too much at once.
”他告诉《财经》记者。
He told Caijing.
武汉公交司机与货车司机对接2月14日武汉下了雨，2月15日武汉下了雪，这加大了物资运送的难度。
Wuhan public transport drivers and truck drivers docked February 14, Wuhan rain, February 15, Wuhan fell snow, which increased the difficulty of goods delivery.
此外，中南医院接到指挥部通知，2月16日要集中收治一批新冠肺炎重症病人，所有能动员的人随机被动员去清空病房，改造隔离病房。
In addition, the South-Central Hospital received a command order to concentrate on 16 February to treat a group of patients with severe pneumonia, all those who can be mobilized were randomly mobilized to empty wards and reform isolation wards.
而且，中南大学的不少医护人员，都被调派去支援方舱医院和雷神山医院，医院里人手紧缺。
In addition, a number of staff from Chung Nan University have been deployed to support the Fong Kok Hospital and Lei Shenshan Hospital, which are in short supply.
“从除夕开始，我们几乎没有休息过。
"We haven't had much rest since New Year's Eve.
”中南医院的一位工作人员告诉《财经》记者，“连我们武汉大学医学院的学生们都全部过来帮忙搬运物资了。
"Even the students from Wuhan University School of Medicine have come to help move supplies," a staff member at Zhongnan Hospital told Caijing.
”不过，因为蔬菜消耗量大，他们还是选择接收这批物资，另一个麻烦摆在眼前，由于马上要接收一批重症病人，医院里很多道路都封锁了，大货车要开进去尤其需要一些技术，公交司机李师傅已经10年没有开过货车了，“以前我开的货车只有5个档，这辆有12个档。
However, they chose to receive the supplies because they consumed so much vegetables, and another problem was that many roads in the hospital were blocked as they were about to receive a number of seriously ill patients.
”经过协调，货车终于开到了物资停放处。
"After coordination, the van finally pulled into the parking lot.
等了近半小时，才有几名工作人员匆忙赶来搬运。
It took nearly half an hour for a few staff members to rush to carry it.
货仓里有茄子、辣椒、芥蓝、大蒜、西蓝花、白菜等近10个品种，“这个茄子真漂亮，用五花肉沫烧肯定好吃，”一名工作人员说道，“可惜没有肉了。
There were nearly 10 varieties of eggplant, chili, mustard, garlic, cyanobacteria and cabbage in the warehouse. "This eggplant is so beautiful that it must be delicious with five-flower foam," said one of the staff.
”蔬菜搬运期间，很快有一些医护人员和路人聚集过来，工作人员让他们不要聚集在一起，“疫情期间，一旦有人群聚集，警察很快就来了，等我们都打包好了，你们再过来领取。
During the vegetable-moving period, some paramedics and passers-by gathered quickly and the staff told them not to gather together. "During the outbreak, once the crowd had gathered, the police came in quickly, and when we were all packed, you came back to get them.
”一位路人悄悄拿走了一颗茄子，藏在了背后。
A passerby stole an eggplant and hid it behind his back.
现场的另一位工作人员胡医生告诉《财经》记者，医院现在最缺的还是医护物资，“那是救命的物资，我们现在N95口罩和防护服都告急，医生们只能戴两层医用口罩，用雨衣当防护服。
"It's a life-saving thing," another Caijing staff member told Caijing News. "It's life-saving supplies. We're now in a crisis over N95 masks and protective clothing.
”5000斤蔬菜很快搬运完毕，胡医生说，希望政府能够合理协调物资，分批多次运送，而不是一次性来太多，他们也没有那么多人手可以调配，且容易造成物资浪费。
"With 5,000 kilograms of vegetables moved quickly, Dr Hu said he hoped the government would coordinate supplies properly and deliver them in batches rather than just too many at a time.
社区：物资分发难题损耗的蔬菜被扔在路边，等待处理离开医院后，王琛带着司机师傅赶往江夏区的联投龙湾社区，由于武汉开始社区封闭式管理，居民们购买蔬菜也成为难题。
Community: Frustrated vegetables were thrown by the roadside and were waiting to be treated before leaving the hospital. Wang Chen took his chauffeur to the Lianyu Longwan community in Jiangxia.
这座社区只保留了一个进出口，入口较窄，货车很难进入，差一点撞到门口的岗亭。
The community retained only one entrance, a narrow entrance that was difficult for trucks to access and narrowly missed the gates.
王琛和工作人员帮忙指挥，李师傅才费劲地开了进去。
Wang Chen and the staff to help the command, Li Shifu difficult to open in.
武汉的公交车司机可能是全国的公交司机中最出名的群体，以在武汉长江大桥上超火车著称，武汉人经常开的玩笑是，如果赶时间，就坐公交车。
Wuhan, which is probably the best-known group of bus drivers in the country, is famous for overtaking trains on the Wuhan Yangtze Bridge. Wuhan people often joke that if in a hurry, take a bus.
在开着货车运送物资时，李师傅的时速保持在25公里， “他们大老远捐赠物资过来，千万不能磕了碰了。
While he was carrying the goods in the van, Master Li kept his speed at 25 kilometers an hour. "They are donating supplies all the way here, so don't knock each other up.
”社区里除了工作人员，还有十几名业主自发来当志愿者，很快就把货车清空了，各类蔬菜摆了满满一地，引来不少楼上的居民们在阳台上探头向下望。
In addition to the staff, a dozen other owners volunteered their services and soon emptied the lorries, filling the floor with vegetables, prompting many upstairs residents to lean down on the balconies.
社区的工作人员有点发愁，这么多蔬菜，配送到每一户是个难题。
Community workers are a bit worried, so much vegetables, distribution to every household is a problem.
“如果今晚就送，又不知道要加班到几点，如果明天再送，又怕蔬菜不新鲜了。
"If I send it tonight and I don't know what time I have to work overtime, if I send it tomorrow, I'm afraid the vegetables won't be fresh.
”最后他们决定在业主微信群里统一通知，业主们带着菜篮子自行来领取。
Finally they decided to issue a notice in the owners' micromail group that the owners would bring their own baskets and collect them.
蔬菜刚刚从货车上搬运下来，还没来得及拆箱，就有业主等不及了。
Vegetables have just been removed from the lorry, there is no time to unpack, owners can not wait.
一位男性业主跑来社区办公室，询问是否可以拿蔬菜回去，工作人员告诉他，会统一通知大家来领取，该业主称，家里已经没有菜了，他要现在就拿一些回去做晚饭。
When a male owner came to the community office and asked if he could take the vegetables home, he was told that he would be notified to collect them. The owner stated that there was no food left in the house and he would take some back to cook dinner now.
工作人员让他先回家，等收到通知后再来，他说，“那你要第一个给我打电话。
The clerk told him to go home first and come back at short notice. "Then you have to call me first," he said.
”工作人员表示，会在微信群里统一通知，他说，“我没有微信。
Staff said there would be a unified message in the group, he said. "I don't have a letter.
”这座社区共有2000户居民，并不算大型社区。
The community of 2,000 residents is not a large community.
随着社区封闭管理，不少社区都出现了食品短缺的问题，但具体到每家每户，情况又不一样。
With the community closed management, many communities have food shortages, but specific to each household, the situation is different.
有的居民更谨慎，不到迫不得己，绝不出门，哪怕是免费领取物资；有的居民由于身体原因，很难出门领取物资；还有的居民会挑剔，如果没有喜欢吃的品种，也不愿意领取。
Some residents are more careful not to go out of their homes, even if they receive supplies free of charge; some find it difficult to get things out of their homes because of their health; others are picky and are reluctant to take what they like.
因此，即使物资都直接送到社区里面，还未完成最终使命。
Thus, even if the goods are delivered directly to the community, the final mission is not yet complete.
社区的工作人员们仍然面临大量的工作，“我们也不能挨家挨户送上门，工作量太大不说，也担心工作人员会有感染风险。
Community workers still have a lot of work to do. "We can't go door-to-door, do too much work and worry about staff being at risk.
”晚上8点半，12辆货车的物资终于发放完毕，他们回到武东高速路口集合。
At 8: 30 p.m., supplies for 12 lorries were finally delivered, and they returned to the Wuhan expressway junction to gather.
12位货车司机已经在这里等待了一整天，货车司机王师傅告诉《财经》记者，他手机都已经玩到没电了。
Twelve truck drivers have been waiting here all day. Master Wang, the lorry driver, told Caijing that his cell phone was dead.
送走货车司机们，王琛还需要给各级政府部门汇报工作，并汇总捐赠信息，整理捐赠接受文件。
Send off lorry drivers, Wang Chen also need to report to all levels of government departments, and aggregate donation information, tidy up the receipt of documents donation.
至此，这一趟的物资捐赠告一段落，但社区的工作还未结束。
At this point, this trip of material donations to the end, but the community work is not over.
2月17日上午，另一些社区的居民前往领取点领取蔬菜，现场排起了长队，为了避免接触，居民们自觉间隔两米。
On the morning of 17 February, residents of other communities went to the collection point to collect their vegetables and formed a long queue at the site, conscious intervals of two metres in order to avoid contact.
下午2点，领菜的居民越来越少，由于包装简单，未做保鲜处理，不少蔬菜被丢弃在路上，工作人员称是已经坏掉了蔬菜，只能销毁处理。
At 2 p.m., fewer and fewer people are taking food, because the packaging is simple, not fresh treatment, a lot of vegetables were abandoned on the road, staff said is damaged vegetables, can only be destroyed.
一位不愿具名的新发地蔬菜商此前也给武汉捐赠了一批蔬菜物资，从云南产地出发，通过冷链运输车运来武汉，这位蔬菜商告诉《财经》记者，他们作为批发商，对蔬菜物资的处理和运输更有经验，可以保证物资在经过长途运输后，仍然保持品质，且便于分发。
An unnamed local vegetable seller, who had donated vegetables to Wuhan from Yunnan, told Caijing they were more experienced in handling and transporting vegetables as wholesalers to ensure that the goods remained of good quality and easy to distribute over long distances.
“如果是农民自发组织的，更容易造成损耗。
"If it is organized spontaneously by farmers, it is more likely to cause losses.
”今天，武汉的社区封锁管理越来越严格，不少武汉居民都向《财经》记者反馈，生活物资告急。
Today, Wuhan community blockade management more and more strict, many Wuhan residents are "Caijing" reporter feedback, life supplies are in urgent need.
但另一头，物资浪费、损耗的情况已经出现。
But at the other end of the spectrum, waste and wastage have already occurred.
这需要政府从物资源头开始，更有效的规划、调配，适时引入专业企业力量。
This requires the government to start from the source of materials, more effective planning, deployment, timely introduction of professional corporate strength.
