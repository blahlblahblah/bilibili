2月12日0时-24时，湖北省新增新冠肺炎病例14840例(含临床诊断病例13332例)。
Between 0000 and 2400 hours on February 12, 14,840 new cases of pneumonia (including 13,332 cases of clinical diagnosis) were reported in Hubei Province.
为何一天激增上万例？什么是临床诊断病例？为何将临床诊断病例数纳入确诊病例数进行公布？临床诊断病例去哪里？怎么治？为何一天激增上万例？2月11日0时-24时，湖北省新增新冠肺炎病例1638例。
Why have there been tens of thousands of cases a day? What are the clinical diagnosis cases? Why are the number of clinical diagnosis cases included in the number of confirmed cases announced? Where are the clinical diagnosis cases? How to treat them? Why are there tens of thousands of cases?
为何2月12日新增新冠肺炎病例一下子上涨到了14840例？原因就是，湖北将临床诊断病例数纳入了确诊病例数。
Why did the number of new cases of pneumonia on Feb. 12 skyrocket to 14,840? Hubei added the number of clinical diagnoses to the number of confirmed cases.
什么是临床诊断病例？国家卫生健康委办公厅、国家中医药管理局办公室日前印发《新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎诊疗方案（试行第五版）》，在湖北省的病例诊断分类中增加了“临床诊断”，以便患者能及早按照确诊病例接受规范治疗，进一步提高救治成功率。
The Office of the National Council of Health and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine have published the "Diagnosis and Treatment of Coronavirus Infection in Pneumonia: A Trial Fifth Edition," adding a "clinical diagnosis" to the case diagnosis classification in Hubei Province so that patients can receive standard treatment according to the confirmed cases as early as possible and further improve the success rate of treatment.
根据第五版诊疗方案的表述，疑似病例具有肺炎影像学特征者，为临床诊断病例。
According to the fifth edition of the diagnosis and treatment plan, suspected cases with imaging characteristics of pneumonia, a clinical diagnosis.
而且，“疑似病例”标准修改为：无论有没有流行病学史，只要符合“发热和/或呼吸道症状”和“发病早期白细胞总数正常或降低，或淋巴细胞计数减少”这2条临床表现，便可考虑为疑似病例。
Moreover, the "suspected case" criterion has been revised to refer to suspected cases, with or without an epidemiological history, provided that the two clinical manifestations of "fever and / or respiratory symptoms" and "normal or decreased leukocyte count in the early stages of onset, or reduced lymphocyte count" are met.
相当于疑似病例标准放宽了。
The standard for suspected cases has been relaxed.
湖北卫健委表示，根据该方案，近期湖北省对既往的疑似病例开展了排查并对诊断结果进行了订正，对新就诊患者按照新的诊断分类进行诊断。
According to the program, Hubei Wei Jiangnu recently conducted a screening of suspected cases and revised the results of the diagnosis. New patients were diagnosed according to the new diagnostic classification.
为与全国其他省份对外发布的病例诊断分类一致，从今天起，湖北省将临床诊断病例数纳入确诊病例数进行公布。
Since today, Hubei Province has included the number of clinical diagnosis cases in the number of confirmed cases, in line with the classification of cases published by other provinces of the country.
为什么要纳入临床诊断病例？中国疾控中心流行病学首席科学家曾光对媒体解释称，“临床诊断病例”就是实验室还没确诊，还没有查到核酸检测阳性，只是临床症状“看着像”。
The "clinical diagnosis" is that the laboratory has not confirmed the diagnosis, has not detected a positive nucleic acid test, only clinical symptoms "look like it," Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist at the China CDC, told the media.
曾光表示，这种“迟迟不呈现阳性”的病人确实存在，又不能排除，因此很容易在社会上传播，把这些人纳入新增病例，就可以对他们采取隔离措施，入院治疗，这对社会和病患本人都有好处。
Zeng said the "delayed positive" patients do exist and cannot be ruled out, so it is easy to spread in society. Including these people in the new cases allows them to be isolated and hospitalized, which benefits both society and the patient himself.
把“临床诊断病例数”纳入“确诊病例数”进行公布，是正确的步骤，堵塞了一个传播的漏洞。
The inclusion of the "number of clinical diagnoses" in the "number of confirmed cases" for publication is the right step, closing a loophole for transmission.
Play来源：央视新闻中央指导组专家、北京朝阳医院副院长童朝晖在接受央视采访时表示，我们在看病诊断肺炎时，能够拿得到的病原学，也就百分之二三十，剩下的百分之七八十要靠临床诊断。
In an interview with CCTV, Tong Chaohui, vice-dean of the Beijing Chaoyang Hospital and an expert on CCTV News, said that when we see a doctor diagnose pneumonia, we get 2-30 percent of the available etiology.
从临床思维和临床医生的临床路径角度来说，增加临床病例的诊断，有益于临床医生对疾病多一个判断。
From the point of view of clinical thinking and clinician's clinical path, increasing the diagnosis of clinical cases is helpful for clinicians to judge the disease.
童朝晖指出，前一段时间我们主要是靠核酸来进行确诊病例。
Children Chaohui pointed out that some time ago we mainly rely on nucleic acid to carry out confirmed cases.
实际上按照我们临床诊断的标准，是有一大部分疑似病例的。
In fact, by the standards of our clinical diagnosis, there is a large number of suspected cases.
中国医学科学院院长王辰2月5日曾对媒体表示，现在对于病毒核酸的检测能力在不断提升，但不同的试剂之间精准程度有差别，并不是所有患者都能检测出核酸阳性，所以有大量看着流行病学史上、接触史上像是，临床症状也像是，但是核酸未能得到确证的病人，现在被列为疑似病例，建议在武汉出现这样的病人，应当可以列为临床诊断病例，因为核酸对于已确诊的病人阳性率也只在30%~50%之间，因此设出临床诊断这个档级是非常有必要的。
The presence of nucleic acids in Wuhan is recommended as a clinical diagnosis, since the number of patients with unconfirmed nucleic acid is only 30% -50%, so it is necessary to set up a clinical diagnostic scale.
临床诊断病例去哪里？怎么治？——应当立即进行隔离治疗按照第五版诊疗方案，针对湖北省，要求各级各类医疗机构的医务人员发现符合病例定义的疑似病和临床诊断病例后，应当立即进行隔离治疗，疑似病例和临床诊断病例要单间隔离，对疑似病例和临床诊断病例要尽快采集标本进行病原学检测。
In accordance with the fifth edition of the diagnosis and treatment plan, medical personnel at all levels and types of medical institutions should be required to immediately carry out isolation treatment. Suspected cases and clinically diagnosed cases should be isolated in single rooms. Samples of suspected cases and clinically diagnosed cases should be collected for etiological examination as soon as possible.
根据湖北当地媒体报道，根据要求，临床诊断病例应该先去集中隔离点，达到重症或危重症就应去定点医院。
According to the local media in Hubei Province, according to the request, clinical diagnosis cases should first go to a central isolation point, reached a serious or critical case should go to a hospital.
进一步病原学检查，即核酸检测后，如果确诊为轻症，应去方舱医院。
Further etiology examination, that is, nucleic acid testing, if diagnosed as a mild disease, should go to the cabin hospital.
