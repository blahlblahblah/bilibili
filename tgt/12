根据公开数据，武汉一年新生人口大约有12至13万。
According to open data, Wuhan has a new population of about 120,000 to 130,000 a year.
这意味着目前受疫情影响的即将生育的孕妇至少有一万人。
This means that at least 10,000 pregnant women are currently affected by the epidemic.
武汉封城之后，交通不便，医疗资源骤然紧张，孕检、用药和生产成为孕妇必须面对的难题。
Wuhan after the closure of the city, traffic, medical resources suddenly tense, pregnancy testing, medication and childbirth has become a difficult problem for pregnant women.
接待孕产妇的四家指定医院难以满足发热产妇的诊治需求，对于有疑似新冠症状的孕妇而言，情况无疑雪上加霜。
It is difficult for the four designated hospitals for pregnant women to meet the needs of pregnant women, and the situation is no doubt even worse for pregnant women with suspected symptoms of the new crown.
面对困难，即将生产的准妈妈们正在全力保全自己与胎儿的生命安全。
Faced with difficulties, expectant mothers are trying to save their lives and those of their unborn child.
···············❶“有种即将家破人亡的感觉”武汉市中心医院后湖院区门口，中年男人李树杰精疲力尽地打着车。
"A sense of imminent destruction of one's home" Li Shujie, a middle-aged man, was beating an exhausted car at the gate of the Houhu courtyard of Wuhan Central Hospital.
这是1月29日晚，天气阴冷。
It was the night of 29 January, and it was cold.
他怀孕38周的妻子坐在编织袋上，理论上随时有可能生产。
His wife, who was 38 weeks pregnant, was sitting on a knitted bag, theoretically ready to give birth.
刘芳芳已经发了一整天的烧，温度在37.4-37.8度之间徘徊，她同时畏寒、浑身乏力、嗜睡，胎动明显减少。
Liu Fangfang has been burning for a whole day, with temperatures ranging from 37.4 to 37.8 degrees. She suffers from chills, fatigue, lethargy and a marked reduction in fetal movements.
不远处的发热门诊内，候诊的大部分是老年人。
In the fever clinic not far away, the waiting lists are mostly elderly people.
一位老人和医务人员起了摩擦。
An old man had a brush with the medical staff.
老人反复说，我是经人介绍来这做确诊的，护士就一直强调，我们这里没办法做核酸检测。
The old man kept saying, I was referred here for a diagnosis, and the nurse kept saying we couldn't have a nucleic acid test here.
在门诊等待几个小时后，医护人员告诉李树杰夫妇，这家医院还在改建，目前没有床位，无法接收孕妇。
After several hours of waiting at the clinic, paramedics told Mr. and Mrs. Li that the hospital was being rebuilt and that there were no beds available to receive pregnant women.
暮色四合。
Twilight reigns.
同样无果而返的老人也准备离开。
The old man, who was also unsuccessful, was ready to leave.
妻子在冷风里头吹了四十分钟，李树杰还是没能打到车。
His wife blew in the cold wind for 40 minutes, but Li Shujie still could not get a taxi.
看着妻子一脸倦色，回忆起过去一周经历的一切，李树杰说：“有种即将家破人亡的感觉。
Looking at his wife's tired face and remembering what she had experienced over the past week, Li said: "There is a sense of imminent destruction.
”在武汉市新冠肺炎防控指挥部于1月28日下达的红头文件里，曾明确了新型肺炎感染的确诊及疑似病例“伴有慢性肾功能衰竭病人、孕产妇、外科疾病的特殊病人由指定的发热定点医院负责收治”。
In a red-letter document issued on January 28 by Wuhan's Xinguan Pneumonia Prevention and Control Command, the city confirmed the diagnosis and suspected case of new pneumonia "with chronic renal failure, maternal and surgical disease, special patients are admitted to designated fever referral hospitals."
名单列有：同济医院中法新城院区、协和医院西院、人民医院东院区及中心医院后湖院区。
The list includes the French New Town Hospital, the Western Hospital of Concorde Hospital, the East Hospital of the People's Hospital and the Houhu Campus of the Central Hospital.
李树杰不明白，这里不是政府公示的定点医院吗？为什么不能接收发热孕妇呢？李树杰的通话记录志愿者团队也在帮助这对夫妇。
Li did not understand that this is not a government-announced designated hospital? Why can't we accept pregnant women with fever? Li Shujie's team of volunteer callers are also helping the couple.
他们一轮轮地打电话。
They made round-the-clock phone calls.
四家指定医院中只有一家表示可以接收，“但没有床位了”。
Only one of the four designated hospitals said it was acceptable, "but there were no beds."
1月31日凌晨夜间，刘芳芳开始浑身发抖，揣着热水袋才感觉好些。
In the early morning of January 31, Liu Fang began to tremble and feel better with a hot water bag.
咳嗽不断的李树杰还在打电话求助。
The coughing Li Shujie is still on the phone for help.
几天前，李树杰和母亲都被诊断为病毒性肺炎。
A few days ago, both Li and his mother were diagnosed with viral pneumonia.
没能做到核酸检测，无法确诊，也无法入院。
No nucleic acid test, no diagnosis, no admission.
家里只有两个房间，为了隔离开来，刘芳芳带着两岁的女儿睡，李树杰的母亲一间房，李树杰和父亲则睡在客厅里头。
There were only two rooms in the house. To separate them, Liu Fang slept with his two-year-old daughter, Li Shujie's mother in a room, and Li Shujie and his father in the living room.
为了不传染父亲，李树杰睡觉时都戴着口罩。
In order not to infect his father, Li Shujie sleeps wearing a mask.
不久后，两人的症状越来越多，李树杰开始怕冷、食欲不振，“晚上睡觉的时候嘴里很苦”。
After a while, the two symptoms more and more, Li Shujie began to fear the cold, loss of appetite, "at night when sleeping mouth is very bitter."
而妻子刘芳芳也开始鼻塞，流涕，咳嗽。
And his wife Liu Fang Fang also began to stuffy nose, runny nose, cough.
白天，他们把两岁的女儿锁在房间里面，与大人隔离开。
During the day, they locked their two-year-old daughter in a room, isolated from adults.
“女儿感觉家里的气氛很不一样”，李树杰拖着哑了的嗓子，“她会哭，没有理由地哭。
"My daughter feels the atmosphere is very different," Li Shujie dragged hoarse voice, "she can cry, no reason to cry.
”他沉默了一会儿，擤了擤鼻涕，带着浓重的哭腔说，她比平时爱哭了，爱哭很多。
'he said, in a deep, weeping tone, and he blew his nose after a moment's silence.
海豚在最近几天连续帮助了两名发热的疑似感染孕妇，两人现已确诊。
Dolphins have helped two febrile pregnant women in recent days, and both have now been diagnosed.
在援助过程中，她发现政府指定的四家指定医院实际并不具备为发热孕妇接产的条件（没有符合条件的隔离产护病房）。
In the course of her assistance, she found that the four designated hospitals designated by the Government did not in fact have the conditions for the delivery of pregnant women with fever (there were no qualifying seclusion wards).
此外，孕妇的抵抗力很弱，她们难以支撑去人满为患的十家定点医院做核酸监测，因此难以确诊。
In addition, the resistance of pregnant women is very low and they have difficulty in supporting nucleic acid surveillance in the 10 designated hospitals that are overcrowded, making diagnosis difficult.
她给湖北省妇联主席发去短信，指出目前有三个亟待解决的问题：为发热、疑似、感染孕妇提供用车；开辟优先通道给发热、疑似孕妇做核酸检测；指定并落实能够为发热疑似、感染孕妇做产检和接生的医院。
She sent a text message to the president of the Hubei Provincial Women's Federation, pointing out three immediate problems: the provision of cars for pregnant women with fever, suspicion and infection; the setting up of priority routes for nucleic acid testing of pregnant women with fever and suspicion; and the designation and implementation of hospitals that could provide prenatal care and delivery for pregnant women with fever and suspected infection.
对方很快回复道，“这类问题会让市指挥部统一研究、处理。
The other party quickly replied, "This kind of problem will let the city command unify study, processing.
”❷医院太缺人了，我不能请假“武汉留守孕妈群”内有200多名孕妇，其中孕期超过35周的就有50名。
There are more than 200 pregnant women in Wuhan, 50 of whom are more than 35 weeks pregnant.
海豚每天在群内回复上百条信息。
Dolphins reply to hundreds of messages a day in the group.
各种状况都有：需要保胎的高危孕妇断药了，可能早产的，寻麻疹发作的。
A variety of conditions: high-risk pregnant women who need to abort, may give birth prematurely, the outbreak of measles.
许多孕妇建档在综合医院，由于疫情发生，许多医院成为定点医院，无法进行产检了。
Many pregnant women are housed in general hospitals, many of which have become designated hospitals and are no longer able to undergo antenatal care due to the outbreak of the disease.
孕妇们的情绪恐慌，群内有各地区的产妇科医护提供咨询，也有社工和心理干预安抚情绪。
Pregnant women are in a state of emotional panic, with local maternity units providing counselling, social workers and psychological intervention to calm the situation.
普通孕妇相对容易找到医院接产，发热孕妇则很难找到医院接收。
It is relatively easy for the average pregnant woman to find a hospital for delivery, and it is difficult for pregnant women with fever to find hospital.
一名发热孕妇的操作流程应该是：先做血检与CT，如果CT片显示肺部感染，下一步做核酸检测，确诊了才能联系医院。
The procedure for a pregnant woman with fever should be: blood test and CT, if the CT scan shows lung infection, the next step to do nucleic acid testing, confirmed to contact the hospital.
“但现在问题是没有试剂盒。
"But the problem now is that there is no kit.
”海豚说，不能确诊就是疑似病人，“定点医院敢收一个疑似病人去感染病房吗？普通医院敢收一个发热病人到普通病房吗？都不对吧，路堵死了！“据GQ报道多方询问了解，某三甲医院在最近一段时间内接连收治了数名确诊感染或疑似的孕妇。
"If you can't confirm the diagnosis is a suspected patient, can you accept a suspected patient to infect the ward? Can a febrile patient be admitted to the general ward?
但该医院并不在疾控指挥部指定接产的名单之列。
But the hospital is not on the CDC's list of designated deliveries.
“他们是冲着人道主义精神，医护人员冒着很大的风险为产妇接生。
"They're in the spirit of humanitarianism and the doctors and nurses are taking great risks in delivering babies," she said.
”知情人员表示，“但文件下达后，他们也不收孕妇了。
"But after the documents were issued, they stopped accepting pregnant women," said one person familiar with the matter.
”另一家名单指定的医院则感到茫然，“（该医院）医生说他们甚至都没有开产科，他们自己都很不理解为什么会把他们医院作为定点医院。
Another designated hospital was at a loss: "Doctors say they don't even have an obstetrics department, and they don't understand why they use their hospital as a designated hospital.
”为感染孕妇接产是件“非常危险的事”。
Giving birth to an infected woman is "very dangerous."
生产过程中的大量羊水、体液携带病毒，除非有防护服，否则会浸透医护人员的普通手术服，感染风险很大。
During the production process, a large number of amniotic fluid and body fluids carry the virus. Unless protective clothing is available, it will be soaked in the common surgical clothing of medical personnel, posing a high risk of infection.
“孕妇和家属没法理解医护人员的为难，他们只能对医院充满怨气。
"Pregnant women and their families cannot understand the dilemma faced by health-care workers, who have to complain about hospitals.
”海豚说，但她理解，医院也不容易。
"said the dolphin, but she understood that the hospital was not easy.
“许多医院都没有防护服”。
Many hospitals do not have protective clothing.
一回，志愿者给医院打电话，电话那头护士对她说，“全科室都污染了”。
Once, the volunteer called the hospital and the nurse told her, "The whole department is polluted."
志愿者说，辛苦了。
Volunteers say it's hard.
护士哭了，志愿者也跟着哭。
The nurse cried, and so did the volunteer.
通常，医院都会用非常抱歉的语气拒绝海豚，“真的抱歉，我们现在真的没法接，来了也做不了手术，会耽误她们。
Usually, the hospital would reject the dolphins in a very apologetic tone. "I'm really sorry, but we can't pick them up right now.
”怀孕五个月的小溪还在轮值24小时的值班。
The stream, which is five months pregnant, is still on 24-hour duty.
她是武汉市内一家医院的医生，科室里三人的小组只剩下她一个了。
She was a doctor at a hospital in Wuhan, and she was the only one left in the three-member department.
有的同事被抽调去支援发热门诊，有的已经感染。
Some colleagues were evacuated to support the fever clinic, while others were infected.
领不到N95，小溪四天才能换一次口罩，护目镜和防护服只能用酒精擦拭后重复使用。
Without N95, the stream can only change its mask once every four days. Goggles and protective clothing can only be wiped with alcohol and re-used.
防护服穿着不透气，小溪常闷出一生汗来。
Wear airtight clothing, the stream often stuffy sweat.
口罩也让她觉得闷，吸氧不够，肚子里的孩子动得厉害。
The mask also made her feel stuffy, not enough oxygen, and the baby in her stomach moved very hard.
好友萨莉向我们转述了这个故事。
My good friend Sally told us the story.
这是小溪怀上的第二个孩子。
This is the second child conceived by the stream.
上一次因为感染流感滑了胎。
Last time I had a flat tire with flu.
好不容易才再次怀孕。
It took some time to get pregnant again.
12月做产检时，医生告诉她，胎盘低置，有流产的风险。
During an obstetrical examination in December, the doctor told her that the placenta was low and there was a risk of miscarriage.
医生让小溪不可久站，不可劳累，不可情绪过度紧张——但现在，小溪的工作时长增加不少，需要独自照顾病人、巡查病房，压力大得“天天都会大哭一场”。
Doctors keep the stream from standing, from being tired, from becoming emotionally overwrought - but now the creek is working long hours, taking care of the sick alone, inspecting the wards, and under pressure "crying every day."
出于某种压力，小溪在最后关头拒绝了我们的采访。
Under some pressure, the stream refused our interview at the last minute.
好友萨莉劝她保重身体，赶紧请假休养。
Friend Sally advised her to take good care of herself and take time off for rest.
小溪内心挣扎，还是拒绝了，“医院太缺人了。
Stream inner struggle, or refused, "the hospital is too short of people.
我不能请假，对不起我的同事们。
I can't ask for leave. I'm sorry to my colleagues.
”❸一身两命，不得不有的“玻璃心”由于武汉市内的综合医院几乎都投入了疫情工作，孕妇们大多停止了孕检、产检。
Since almost all the Wuhan general hospitals are involved in the epidemic situation, most pregnant women stop pregnancy tests and check-ups.
许多孕妇被困在家里，只能“凭感觉”去判断宝宝的健康。
Many pregnant women are trapped in their homes and can only "feel" about their babies' health.
每天吃完饭以后，她们会放轻音乐，数自己的胎动。
Every day after dinner, they would put on light music and count their own fetal movements.
武汉市内的焦急情绪在雌激素激增的孕期更加放大了。
Anxiety in Wuhan is magnified during the estrogen boom.
怀孕19周的杜杜每天不断周转在新闻平台和科普网站。
Doudou, 19 weeks pregnant, is constantly running around the news platform and the popular science website every day.
她担心，如果自己没有出现感染症状，身体是否也可能存在病毒，会不会传给胎儿？如果自己感染了，怎么去医院？照CT对早期胎儿有害，用药也会伤害孩子……尽管距离生产还有五个多月，下一次产检排在一个月后，但她克服不了自己的焦虑情绪。
She worries that if she doesn't have symptoms, she may have the virus, will she pass it to the fetus? If she gets it, how can she go to the hospital? CT is bad for the early fetus, and medication can hurt the baby.
几天前她察觉到了肚痛。
She detected a stomachache a few days ago.
从孕期开始，她就去私立医院产检，有自己的主管医生。
From the beginning of her pregnancy, she went to a private hospital, where she had her own doctor in charge.
但这个时候，她联系不上自己的主治医师了。
By this time, however, she could not contact her attending physician.
武汉封了城，公共交通停运，没有私家车，只能去社区找车。
Wuhan sealed the city, public transport stopped, there are no private cars, can only go to the community to find cars.
疫情爆发之后，社区电话便再也打不通了。
After the outbreak of the outbreak, community telephones were no longer available.
她每天要用上十几次抑菌洗手液，结果手上起了红疹，脱皮，痒。
She used a dozen bacteriostatic hand sanitizers every day, and her hands developed rashes, peeling and itching.
“孕妇过度紧张，情绪过于激动，都会导致体内催产素分泌增加，进而引起腹痛，甚至流产。
"Excessive stress and emotion in pregnant women can lead to increased oxytocin production, which can lead to abdominal pain and even miscarriage.
“武汉都市妇产医院主治医师袁昌玲对GQ报道说。
Yuan Changling, chief physician at Wuhan Metropolitan Maternity Hospital, told GQ.
由于公立医院妇产科门诊的停诊，不再接收孕产妇，使得武汉几家还在营业的私立医院突然爆满。
As a result of the public hospital obstetrics and gynecology clinics, no longer accept pregnant women, Wuhan several private hospitals are still open suddenly full.
私立医院相对宽松，只要孕妇体温正常，没有特殊疾病，一般都可接收。
Private hospitals are relatively loose and are generally acceptable as long as the pregnant woman has normal body temperature and no particular illness.
只是花费高昂，普遍要比公立医院贵上至少四分之一。
It is expensive and generally at least a quarter more expensive than public hospitals.
但对许多人来说，花费问题在此刻显得不再重要。
But for many, the cost issue is no longer important at the moment.
某种程度上，相较孕早期和孕晚期，孕中期要承担的心理风险或许更大。
To some extent, the psychological risks involved in the middle of pregnancy may be greater than in the early and late stages of pregnancy.
“27到30周，胎儿已经成形，这时一旦出了问题，只能做引产。
"From 27 to 30 weeks, the fetus is already in shape, and if something goes wrong, it's induced.
很危险。
It's dangerous.
”海豚说。
"said the dolphin.
每天对接一二十名孕妇，袁昌玲笑称自己不做医生时“都在做线上心理咨询师”。
Each day docked one to twenty pregnant women, Yuan Changling said he did not become a doctor "are doing on-line psychological counseling."
起初她打字回复，后来打不过来，改发语音，最焦虑的一个孕妇每天给她发上百条信息。
At first she typed back, but later she couldn't. She changed her voice, and one of her most anxious expectant mothers sent her a hundred messages a day.
崩溃大哭是常事。
It's common to break down and cry.
耐心的她都能理解，她们身上有两条生命，“孕妇都有颗玻璃心”。
Patiently, she can understand that they have two lives, "pregnant women have a glass heart."
25岁的何文娟便时常会胡思乱想。
Ho Man-juan, 25, is often cranky.
丈夫周强在一家医院的影像科工作，专门负责拍CT。
Her husband Zhou Qiang worked in the imaging department of a hospital, specializing in CT.
就在钟南山院士对外公布新冠肺炎存在人传人现象的前后时期，周强的工作量猛增。
Just before and after the academician Zhong Nan Shan announced the existence of human-to-human transmission of pneumonia Zhou Qiang's workload soared.
本来一天只用拍100个左右的片子，到了年末，反而要拍上300多个。
Originally only about 100 films a day, by the end of the year, but to shoot more than 300.
医院的排班也大改，每个人要多上一天班，还加了夜班。
The schedule of hospitals has also been overhauled, with each person having to work an extra day and night shifts.
工作时的周强穿着防护服，中途不能脱下来，不能看手机，也很少回信息。
At work Zhou Qiang wearing protective clothing, can not take off the way, can not see the mobile phone, and rarely return information.
宫缩不断时，何文娟心慌意乱，也没能与丈夫获得联系。
When the contractions continued, Ho Wenjuan was upset and unable to get in touch with her husband.
此前周强告诉妻子，一般凌晨三四点以后病人才会少起来。
Zhou Qiang told his wife that patients usually get up after 3: 00 am.
曾有一次，周强在凌晨四点回复了信息，两人通话了20秒。
On one occasion, Zhou Qiang replied to the message at four in the morning and the two talked for 20 seconds.
周强说，你不要熬夜啊。
Zhou Qiang said, you do not stay up late.
确认了妻子平安以后，他便挂断电话，重新回到了岗位上。
After confirming his wife's safety, he hung up the phone and returned to his post.
何文娟体谅丈夫辛苦，更担心他的安全。
He Wenjuan understanding of her husband's hard work, more worried about his safety.
可对孕妇来说，理智无法战胜失落的情绪。
But for pregnant women reason cannot prevail over lost emotions.
以前丈夫去上班前，总是会亲她一下，现在，两人只是简单地拉一下手。
Her husband used to kiss her before he went to work, but now they just give her a simple handshake.
往日周强下班了，会在第一时间嘘寒问暖，逗她开心，同她玩笑。
Zhou Qiang worked in the past, will be the first time to ask warm, tease her happy, with her joke.
现在，周强回家的第一件事情是洗澡、消毒。
Now, the first thing Zhou Qiang went home was to take a bath and disinfect.
丈夫还会刻意地与她保持距离，“除非是我强烈要求他在我旁边，他都不愿意待在我旁边。
The husband would deliberately distance himself from her. "He would not stay with me unless I urged him to be there.
” 有的时候，何文娟还会被丈夫“赶”出来。
"Sometimes, Ho Wenjuan will be" driven out "by her husband.
夫妻二人在一间房子里，有时只能用微信聊天。
The couple were in the same house and sometimes could only talk by letter.
晚上，很多时候周强执意要和妻子分房睡。
At night, Zhou Qiang insisted on sleeping separately from his wife.
这让何文娟格外地不安，“他不在我身边，我就不踏实，就会宫缩地很频繁。
This makes Ho Wenjuan particularly uneasy, "He is not at my side, I do not settle down, will contractions very frequently.
”为此，何文娟哭了好几次，有时胡思乱想起来，还会想“他是不是不喜欢我了”。
"For this reason, He Wenjuan cried several times, sometimes thinking," Is he not like me?
周强终于吐露真情，科里面早就有医生感染了，加上感染了可能也没有症状，不怕一万，就怕万一，“我不想传染给你”。
Zhou Qiang finally revealed the truth, the family already had a doctor infected, plus infection may not have symptoms, not afraid of 10, 000, just in case, "I do not want to infect you.
心疼又委屈的何文娟眼睛泪汪汪的，执拗地要和丈夫睡在一起。
Heart hurt and aggrieved Ho Wenjuan eyes tearful, obstinately want to sleep with her husband.
那一晚，夫妻二人同床而眠，但周强始终背对着他深爱的妻子。
That night, the couple slept together in bed, but Zhou Qiang kept his back to his beloved wife.
❹“看宝宝能坚持多久”小猫半卧在床上，用被子垫高了背部，努力在肚脐周围找到了一处没有青紫的地方扎进针头，把一针管低分子肝素缓缓注入皮下。
Zen "see how long the baby can last" kitten half-lying in bed, with quilt up the back, trying to find around navel where there is no blue needle, a needle low-molecular-weight heparin injection into the skin slowly.
这是孕妇可以使用的少数药物，没有替代品。
This is a small number of drugs available to pregnant women, for which there are no alternatives.
注射刺破的血管，连成一片青紫色。
Injection of pierced blood vessels, into a blue and purple.
这是35岁的她怀孕的第21周，肚子已经高高隆起，宣示着新生命即将到来。
It was the twenty-first week of her 35-year-old pregnancy, and her tummy was raised high, signaling the arrival of a new life.
但肚皮上密密麻麻的青紫瘢痕，透露着这位母亲的不易。
But the dark, purple scars on his belly reveal how difficult it is for the mother.
上次怀孕是在一年多前，宝宝的心脏在27周时突然停止了跳动。
The last pregnancy occurred more than a year ago, when the baby's heart suddenly stopped beating at 27 weeks.
“没有任何感觉“，起初小猫没有发现，直到她意识到胎儿很久没有动了。
"There was no feeling," and at first the kitten didn't notice until she realized the baby hadn't moved for a long time.
她去医院检查，医生告诉她孩子“已经没有了”。
She went to the hospital for an examination and the doctor told her the child was "gone."
当时她不知道自己患有非典型的抗磷脂综合症，这种病不怀孕则已，一怀孕就会捣乱孕妇的凝血系统，让血液处于高度凝固的状态，在胎盘和脐带上长出细小血栓，阻碍了营养的运输，引起胎儿危险。
She did not know that she had atypical anti-phospholipid syndrome, a condition that, once pregnant, disrupted the clotting system of the pregnant woman, left the blood in a highly coagulated state, and developed small thromboses on the placenta and umbilical cord, hindering the transport of nutrients and causing fetal danger.
走出引产的阴霾不是一件容易的事，小猫说，她其实“一直都没有走出这个忧伤”，直到再次怀孕之后才好一点，“经历过的人都知道，这种痛苦真是很难走出来的”。
Getting out of the labor mess isn't easy, the kitten said. She "never got out of it" until she became pregnant again. "Everyone knows it's hard to get out of it."
所以这次怀孕，小猫格外小心，辞去了工作，安心在家卧床保胎。
So this pregnancy, kitten extra careful, quit the job, at home in bed to protect the tires.
到现在，本来应该是比较平稳的21周了，除了每天注射，还需口服两片阿司匹林、一片优甲乐、一颗叶酸、一袋冲剂。
By now, it would have been a fairly smooth 21 weeks, with two aspirin tablets, one yogurt, one folic acid and a bag of granules taken orally, in addition to daily injections.
但一场突如其来的瘟疫打断了这个进程。
But a sudden plague interrupted the process.
就像是还剩最后几个关卡就能把游戏打通关，突然被切断了电路，电脑配置再高、游戏装备再好也没辙。
It was like the last few levels left to clear the game, suddenly cut off the circuit, the computer configuration, the game equipment is no better.
她已经很久没睡一个好觉了。
She hasn't had a good night's sleep.
在微博上看到一个求助的产妇，她失眠到凌晨两点。
I saw a woman on Weibo asking for help. She suffered from insomnia until 2 am.
“我真的很希望有医院能接收她，为她治疗。
"I really want the hospital to take her in and treat her.
每天我的心都是悬着的。
Every day my heart is hanging.
”物伤其类。
"Things hurt.
小猫自己与宝宝的命运也处于未知。
The fate of kittens and their babies is also unknown.
她已经很久没做孕检了。
She hasn't had a pregnancy test for a long time.
常去的省妇幼医院门诊已经停诊，急诊又挂不到号。
Frequent visits to provincial maternity and child care clinics have been discontinued, emergency cases can not be hung.
网上流出消息：省妇幼开始接收发热的病人，也出现了疑似感染的案例——她更不敢去了。
Online outflow: Women and children in the province began to receive febrile patients, but also suspected cases of infection - she did not dare to go.
挂不上急诊号就拿不到医生的处方，没有处方就拿不到药。
No doctor's prescription can be obtained without an emergency number, and no medicine without a prescription.
手里的针剂只够撑个十天。
The needle would only last ten days.
十天之后情况会是什么样，谁也说不好。
What will happen ten days from now is anybody's guess.
这是一月的最后一天，也是武汉封城的第九天。
This is the last day of January and the ninth day of Wuhan.
小猫逼迫自己喝了一大碗鸡汤，打了针吃了药，早早睡下。
Kittens forced themselves to drink a bowl of chicken soup, shot took the medicine, early sleep.
为了早点睡着，她特意“少看那些负面的新闻”。
To go to sleep earlier, she purposely "cut back on the negative news."
但还是睡不着。
Still couldn't sleep.
在“留守武汉孕妈群”里，保胎孕妇们都在偷偷减少着药量：原本一天两针的改为一天一针，原本两天一针的就改为三天一针，掐着药量度日。
"Left behind in Wuhan pregnant mother group," pregnant women are secretly reducing the amount of medicine: originally two needles a day into a day, the original two-day needle into a three-day needle, pinch the amount of medicine.
减少药量并没有给身体带来明显的感觉，但这并不意味着没有危险。
Cutting back on your dose doesn't make the body feel obvious, but it doesn't mean there's no danger.
低分子肝素是孕期重要的药物，自行减少不排除会影响胎儿，甚至可能造成流产等不良妊娠结局。
Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is an important drug in pregnancy, and self-reduction can not rule out adverse pregnancy outcome such as abortion.
小猫自己也知道后果，但没得选择。
The kitten knows the consequences, but it has no choice.
“如果说减少这个用量的话，血液又会产生一个高度凝固的一个状态，然后身体里面的一些免疫系统可能会攻击胚胎。
"If the dosage is reduced, the blood will produce a highly coagulated state, and then some of the body's immune systems may attack the embryo.
然后或者说产生在胎盘上面产生一些细小的血栓，这是很危险的。
Then, or rather, produce some tiny thrombosis above the placenta, which is dangerous.
”可现在只能听天由命了，她说，“看宝宝能坚持多久，够不够坚强，能不能扛过去。
"But now it's up to fate," she said, "to see how long the baby lasts, whether it's strong enough to carry it.
”❺新生命的呼喊“我不知道能不能熬到生的那一天。
"The cry of a new life" I don't know if I can live to the day.
“小猫在家里痛哭过好几次，“一方面为我的城市，一方面为我自己，为肚子里面的孩子。
"The kitten cried at home several times," for my city on the one hand, and for myself, for the baby inside.
不知道后面的路到底该怎么走。
I don't know how to get to the back road.
”“虽然我现在这么说很悲观，但现在在这座城里的人，特别是像我这样高危的人，真的总是忍不住去想，我们最终的结果会是什么样？”小猫偷偷写好了遗书，给朋友发了一份。
"" Although I'm pessimistic about this, people in this city, especially those at risk like me, can't help but wonder what we're going to end up with.The kitten secretly wrote a suicide note and sent a copy to a friend.
在这座孤城中，一群有同样境遇、同样感受的孕妈们通过网络聚集在一起，从彼此的支持中获得安慰。
In this lonesome city, a group of pregnant mothers who share the same situation and feelings get together through the network to take comfort from each other's support.
小猫在好几个高危保胎孕妇的群里，“她们中很多人胎停好多次了，有的人到五十岁还在努力，还有做了好多次试管移植的……怎么会这么难呢？”群里的成员都互称为“姐妹”。
Cats in several high-risk groups of pregnant women, "many of them have had multiple abortions, some are still trying to reach the age of 50, and have made many test-tube transplants... How could it be so difficult?" The members of the group called each other "sisters."
在门诊几乎停摆、交通切断、药也越来越难得到的情况下，“姐妹”们一起商量着对策。
With the clinic almost dead, traffic cut off, and medicine becoming more and more difficult to get, the "sisters" discussed the strategy together.
小猫曾把十分珍贵的针剂匀给一位“姐妹”，对方出现了胎停，“她要的很急，就直接坐地铁到我家门口，都没出站，我隔着栏杆把针递给她。
She wanted something urgent, so she took the subway to my door, but she didn't get out. I handed the needle through the bars.
”失去孩子的痛苦她经历过，不能让“姐妹”再遭受一次。
She had experienced the pain of losing her child, and could not let the sister suffer again.
出于协力抗击疫情及防止进一步感染的考虑，武汉不少医院关闭了其他的科室，除了孕妇，很多其他病患也没法得到像往常一样及时的治疗。
In an effort to combat the epidemic and prevent further infections, Wuhan hospitals have shut down other departments and many other patients, except pregnant women, have been unable to receive timely treatment as usual.
小猫把自己的处境称为“小困难”：“可能政府、国家已经没有办法考虑的那么全面了，在抗击疫情的时候，不可能把我们的小困难每一个都解决得很好。
The kitten describes its situation as a "minor difficulty": "Perhaps the government, the country has been unable to consider the comprehensive, in the fight against the epidemic, we can not solve our small difficulties very well.
”但她又有些矛盾，作为一名准妈妈，她也渴望政策的倾斜，国家能多照顾她们这个特殊群体一些。
But she is ambivalent. As a expectant mother, she also craves a policy tilt, with the state taking more care of her as a special group.
海豚这些天哭了好几场。
Dolphins cry several times these days.
不是累，“是为了混乱而悲伤”。
Not tired, but sad for the sake of chaos.
一直从事危机干预和心理救助的她对死亡并不陌生，但真的眼见一整个家庭被感染，在死亡边缘徘徊，她还是“控制不住”，“好像目睹着家破人亡”。
She, who has been involved in crisis intervention and psychological relief, is no stranger to death, but has actually seen an entire family infected and teetering on the brink of death, "unable to control" and "as if witnessing the destruction of her home."
每个人都对她说，“我只想要活命”，这个时候，心理疏导不起作用了。
Everyone said to her, "I just want to live," and by this time, the psychotherapy doesn't work.
“你问他（求助者）现在状况还好吗？不好！你能感受到他满心的愤怒、委屈、焦虑和绝望。
"You asked him how he was? No! You could feel his anger, his frustration, his anxiety, his despair.
告诉他某个信息可能有用。
Tell him something can be useful.
家属就会问，‘我们去了就能住上吗？住不上吧？还是别去了吧。
The family would ask, 'Can we go and live? Can't we? Or don't we?'
我们去了还能回来吗？’甚至直接放弃：没有人会管我们的。
Can we come back when were gone? Even just give up: Nobody cares about us.
”海豚和志愿者们一起整理名单、发布求助信息，疏通一切关系，竭力做着一切“希望解决问题”的努力，但自己也不时陷入悲伤。
Dolphins and volunteers worked together to collate lists, post help messages, unblock relationships, and do everything they could to "hope for a solution," but they were also sad from time to time.
