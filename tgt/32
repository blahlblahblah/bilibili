今年的除夕夜，对武汉人民，甚至全国人民来说都很特别。
This New Year's Eve is special for the people of Wuhan and even the whole country.
／《饮食男女》昨天，我发了一条朋友圈，问武汉朋友怎么吃年夜饭，所有的回复都是：取消了全部的年夜饭和聚会。
A Man and a Woman Yesterday, I sent out a group of friends to ask Wuhan friends how to eat Chinese New Year's Eve dinner.
除夕夜的前一天，早上十点多，大姑妈在家庭微信群发来了消息：“取消年夜饭，还请谅解。
On the eve of New Year's Eve, more than 10 am, my aunt sent a message in the family micro-letter: "Cancel dinner, please understand.
”这个决定有些晚，但也算及时。
The decision was late, but timely.
那时，武汉已正式实行“封城”，全城的公共交通停摆，机场、火车站离汉通道已经关闭。
At that time, Wuhan has officially implemented the "closed city," the city's public transport stopped, the airport, railway stations have closed Han corridor.
在这之前，我身边很多武汉的朋友，并不太重视这次疫情。
Before that, I had a lot of friends around Wuhan, and did not pay much attention to the epidemic.
朋友圈里，能看到很多他们的自嘲段子，“全世界都以为武汉出事了，只有武汉人在想着今晚去哪玩。
Friends circle, can see a lot of their self-mockery paragraph, "the world thought Wuhan had an accident, only Wuhan people are thinking about where to play tonight.
”这背后，除了巨大的信息不对称，也因为打破了大多数人的惯性思维：疫情持续了二十多天，却突然失去了控制。
Behind this, in addition to the huge information asymmetry, is the fact that most people's inertia has been broken: the epidemic has lasted for more than two decades and suddenly got out of control.
武汉“封城”之后的空荡街道。
Wuhan "closed the city" after the empty streets.
/@林晨同学Hearing这个结果，出乎了人的意料。
/ @ Lin Chen classmate Hearing this result, unexpected.
特意从新加坡赶回武汉过年的堂妹，稍早嗅出了苗头，她的返程机票提早改签了一个礼拜，但还是没想到被滞留了，假期结束后，她会给学校写邮件说明情况。
Her cousin, who traveled to Wuhan for the Spring Festival from Singapore, sniffed the air ticket a week earlier, but was not expected to be detained, after the holidays, she will write to the school to explain the situation.
其实，学校早就关注这件事——半个月前，每个学生都填了一个问卷，学校要留档三个月内去过中国的人。
In fact, the school has long been concerned about this matter - half a month ago, each student filled out a questionnaire and the school had to keep a file for people who had been to China within three months.
很可惜，一场疫情的蔓延速度，很可能快过人们的警觉性。
Unfortunately, the spread of an epidemic is likely to be faster than people are alerted.
对此，普通人毫无准备。
Ordinary people are unprepared for this.
在周一，我告诉妈妈，今年不能回家了，会退掉回武汉的机票。
On Monday, I told my mother that I would not be able to go home this year and would return my plane ticket to Wuhan.
妈妈有些不解，她问我：准备了很多你爱吃的东西，新年怎么能不回家呢？那天之前，在汉口的百步亭小区，举办了4万多人的万家宴。
Her mother puzzled, she asked me: prepared a lot of things you love to eat, how can the New Year not go home? Before that day, in Hankou in the 100 Pavilion community, hosted more than 40,000 people banquet.
我也在家族群里，乐观地向大家表示：“出于安全考虑，我这次不回家过年。
I am also in the family group, optimistic to say: "For security reasons, I do not go home for the New Year.
主要是机场、高铁站，封闭性空间有感染风险。
Mainly in airports, high-speed rail stations, closed spaces are at risk of infection.
市区里应该没什么事情。
There's supposed to be nothing downtown.
”我们家住在武昌，离华南海鲜市场隔着一个长江。
Our family lives in Wuchang, which is separated from the South China seafood market by a Yangtze River.
每天，我都会追踪最新的新闻消息，但在几天前，我并不觉得家里会有危险。
Every day, I keep track of the latest news, but a few days ago, I didn't think there was any danger at home.
直到昨天，我才知道家里的口罩不到十个。
It was not until yesterday that I learned that there were fewer than ten masks in my house.
因为爷爷在去年过世，虽然取消了年夜饭，但父亲执意要如期在家举办上香仪式。
Because Grandpa died last year, despite the cancellation of New Year's Eve dinner, his father insisted on holding incense ceremony at home as scheduled.
年夜饭对中国人有极大的意义。
Lunar New Year dinner is of great significance to the Chinese people.
/《饮食男女》今天除夕夜后，按照习俗，家里的大门会打开，迎接登门上香的亲朋好友。
After New Year's Eve, according to custom, the door of the family will be opened to welcome friends and relatives.
在这种疫情的情况下，大部分人应该不会来，但很难意料谁会出现。
In such an epidemic, most people should not come, but it is hard to predict who will show up.
父亲不太在乎眼下的疫情，他这几年酒桌上认识的朋友，过去的战友，很多和他一样固执己见。
His father didn't care much about the epidemic, the friends he knew on the table over the years, his former comrades-in-arms, many of whom shared his obstinacy.
这个拜访不需要来前打电话。
This visit need not be preceded by a telephone call.
住在我家的堂姐，给我发微信：“你爸出门买糖去了。
My cousin, who lives in my house, sent me a message: "Your father went out to buy sugar.
”妈妈和姐姐，意识到了一些危险，但又有些浑然不觉。
"My mother and sister, aware of some of the danger, were not aware of it.
她们还没有决定好，碰到没有戴口罩上香的访客，是否该拒绝对方登门？今年，我家没有年夜饭在武汉过年，我一直都觉得很冷清。
They have not yet decided whether to refuse a visitor who does not wear mask incense? This year, my family did not celebrate Spring Festival in Wuhan, I have always felt very lonely.
我的妈妈不是本地人，爷爷也是异乡人。
My mother is not a native, and my grandpa is a stranger.
在1950年代，爷爷借用了同村人的身份、学历证，离开了原有在河北省的家庭，考进了武汉的国营工厂。
In the 1950s, Grandpa borrowed his village identity, education certificate, left the original family in Hebei Province, admitted to Wuhan state-owned factory.
我至今都不知道他真实的名字，以及准确的年龄。
I still don't know his real name or his exact age.
去年五月，他因病过世，实际年龄九十多岁。
He died of illness last May. He was in his 90s.
我历来只吃一顿年夜饭，和奶奶那边的亲戚——她和爷爷的三个儿子（包括我父亲），她的哥哥（我的爹爹），爹爹的两个女儿（我的姑妈）。
I used to eat only one New Year's dinner, with my grandma's three sons (including my father), her brother (my father), and my father's two daughters (my aunt).
另外，我有三个堂姐与堂妹，两个表姐。
Besides, I have three cousins and two cousins.
每年的农历二十八日，我爷爷生日那天，大家会一起吃年夜饭。
Every year on the 28th of the lunar calendar, on my grandpa's birthday, everyone will have Chinese New Year's Eve dinner.
家人给爷爷过生日。
The family celebrated Grandpa's birthday.
/赵景宜小时候，六个小孩都围在小桌吃饭。
When Zhao Jingyi was a child, six children were gathered at a small table for dinner.
十几年过去，我们都长大了，两个表姐结婚，亲人间的温情感觉变淡许多。
More than a decade later, we have grown up, two cousins married, relatives between the warm feelings of a lot lighter.
父亲那一代，包括大姑妈，都是在纱厂工作的奶奶一手带大，她常告诫他们要相互扶持，他们长大后，大多去了武昌车辆厂上班，也共同度过了2000年后的下岗潮。
The father's generation, including the great-aunt, had been brought up by her grandmother, who worked in the yarn factory. She often told them to support each other. When they grew up, most of them went to Wuchang depot to work and spent the year 2000 together.
在我们这一代，大家都有了不同的想法，不同的职业，亲人关系早就不热络了。
In our generation, we all have different ideas, different careers, relationships have long been cold.
奶奶去世后，兄弟们的走动也变少了。
When Grandma died, the brothers moved less.
过去大家庭，很自然成了不同的小家庭。
In the past, large families have naturally become different nuclear families.
因此，过年大家一起吃次年夜饭，在表面上维持已经不在的亲密感，成了一件很重要的事。
Therefore, the New Year's Eve dinner together, on the surface to maintain a sense of closeness, has become a very important thing.
爷爷去世后的第一年，按照习俗，必须家人团聚。
In the first year after his death, it was customary to reunite with his family.
这原本也可能是我们聚在一起吃的最后一次年夜饭，大家互相有了默契，不必勉强非要一起过年。
This may have been our last dinner together, we have a tacit understanding, do not have to force the New Year together.
虽然年味渐渐淡了，但今年格外想和家人聚在一起吃团圆饭。
Although the taste of the year gradually light, but this year especially want to get together with their families to eat reunion dinner.
/《别告诉她》奶奶去世的八年来，全家人之所以能一起吃饭，除了大姑妈努力操持外，还有妈妈一直情愿付出。
In the eight years since my grandmother died, my mother has been willing to give to the family who have been able to eat together, in addition to her great-aunt's efforts.
每一次，年夜饭都在我家里办，妈妈要准备做二十人左右的菜。
Every time, Chinese New Year's Eve dinner in my home, my mother has to prepare about twenty dishes.
一大家人在饭桌上，边吃菜边看春晚的时候，妈妈还在厨房里炒菜、端菜、热菜。
A large family at the table, eating vegetables while watching the Spring Festival gala, mother is still in the kitchen stir-frying, pickles, hot dishes.
我们从没有在酒店吃过年夜饭，十几年前觉得太贵，后来又担心显得亲人太过生分。
We never had New Year's Eve dinner at the hotel. We thought it was too expensive a decade ago.
这一次，大姑妈像往年一样买了十几斤的鱼、猪肉，在家里炸肉丸。
This time, as usual, aunt bought a dozen jin of fish, pork, fried meatballs at home.
武汉，炸肉丸是年夜饭必备菜。
Wuhan, fried meatballs are necessary for New Year's Eve meal.
很奇怪，它刚出锅时很好吃，往后就索然无味了。
Strange to say, it was delicious when it first came out of the pot.
这些出锅的肉丸，会提前做好冻在冰箱里，以备新年时吃。
These meatballs are frozen in the fridge ahead of time for the New Year.
做好了肉丸，大姑妈会骑着电动车，送给她的弟弟们。
When the meatball is ready, the aunt rides the electric car and gives it to her brothers.
每次，我们收到姑妈送来的肉丸、腊香肠、咸肉，就知道离新年不远了。
Every time, we received from my aunt meatballs, sausages, bacon, we knew that the New Year was not far away.
家庭中的女性是年夜饭的主力军。
Women in the family are the mainstay of the New Year's Eve meal.
/《别告诉她》疫情的到来，这几天很难买到菜，姑妈做的肉丸刚好成了备用的食物。
Don't Tell Her. It's hard to get food these days. My aunt's meatballs are just a backup food.
因为疫情，也刚好取消了我家已经有些尴尬的年夜饭。
Because of the epidemic, also just cancelled my family already somewhat awkward New Year's Eve dinner.
昨天，我发了一条朋友圈，问武汉朋友怎么吃年夜饭，所有的回复都是：取消了全部的年夜饭和聚会。
Yesterday, I sent a circle of friends, asked Wuhan friends how to eat Chinese New Year's Eve dinner, all the responses are: canceled all the dinner and parties.
这几年，家里人早就习惯了，窗外没有爆竹声的新年，晚饭结束后，大家各自回家看电视。
In recent years, the family has long been used to, no firecrackers outside the window of the New Year, after dinner, everyone went home to watch TV.
这时候只留下空空的客厅，妈妈继续系上围裙，收拾餐桌，除夕夜就这样结束了。
It was the end of New Year's Eve, with only the empty living room left and my mother continuing to tie up her apron and set the table.
“信息都在网上发布，老人根本不知道发生了什么”在“封城”那天的早上，我妈妈去了菜场，为明天的年夜饭做最后的准备。
"The information was posted online and the old man didn't know what was going on." On the morning of the "Sealed City," my mother went to the market to make the final preparations for the New Year's Eve meal.
但她除了拎走两颗大白菜，几乎一无所获，“菜场都抢空了，一早上很多人来买菜。
But she managed to carry two cabbages, but she got almost nothing. The market was empty, and a lot of people came in the morning to buy food
”她估计了一下，家里现有的菜，可以勉强吃够一个礼拜。
She calculated that there was enough food in the house for a week.
家族群发来新消息，建议不要再去超市抢购，人群密集的地方可能会成为新的传染地。
Families are sending new messages, advising against buying in supermarkets, where crowds of people may become new infections.
平日里，亲人们都靠“家族微信群”联系，里面有21个人。
Usually, relatives rely on "family micro-group" contact, there are 21 people.
很少有人讲话，偶尔会有几个长辈，转发一些“科普”、“励志”的小短文。
Few people speak, occasionally have a few elders, forward some "popular science", "inspirational" short essays.
月初，我转了几条“新型肺炎”新闻到群里，少有人回复。
At the beginning of the month, I turned a few "new pneumonia" news into the group, few people responded.
直到1月20号以后，家庭微信群的信息变得多了起来，热烈讨论起应对措施。
After Jan. 20, messages from family microphone groups became more frequent, and responses were enthusiastically discussed.
他们也会发一些小视频，比如“xxxx有人被隔离了，大家不要出门。
They also send video clips, such as "xxxx people are quarantined, so don't go out.
”我们越来越重视这件事。
We are attaching more and more importance to it.
最近几天，妈妈去家附近的三飞菜市场，里面有一个菜贩发热几天后，被隔离。
In the last few days, my mother went to San Fei market near her home, where a vegetable vendor was isolated after a few days of fever.
姑妈家附近一个小区，也出现了一名疑似患病的人。
A suspected sick man also appeared in a small neighborhood near my aunt's house.
“我知道外科口罩只能戴四个小时，用完了要丢进垃圾袋系住，免得二次污染。
"I know surgical masks last only four hours, and when they're done, throw them in garbage bags and tie them up so they don't get re-contaminated.
”姑妈在电话里，对我说。
'said my aunt, on the telephone.
并不是所有的中老人年都不戴口罩，不要形成这样的刻板印象。
Not all middle-aged and elderly people do not wear masks, do not form such a stereotype.
/图虫创意1985年，她在徐家棚街道工作，其间当了十几年社区居委会主任，一直干到退休。
Toothworm Creativity In 1985, she worked in the streets of Xujiajie, during which she served as the director of a community neighborhood committee for more than 10 years.
2003年，非典蔓延的时候，她负责社区的排查工作，“那个时候，我们要挨家挨户上门，登记从国外回来的街坊。
In 2003, when the epidemic spread, she was in charge of community clearance. "At that time, we had to go door-to-door and register our neighborhoods coming back from abroad.
武汉不是重灾区，不像现在气氛那么紧张。
Wuhan is not a disaster area, not as tense as now.
”同姑妈打完电话后，她在微信上给我留言：“封一座城，爱一国人，祈祷所有人健康平安。
After talking to my aunt on the phone, she wrote me a message saying, "Seal a city, love a nation, and pray for the health and safety of all.
98年，我在街道办、民政办工作，参与了抗洪救灾工作。
In 1998, I worked in the street office, civil affairs office, participated in the flood relief work.
在社区工作，两次获得武汉市优秀社区工作者。
Worked in the community and won excellent community workers in Wuhan twice.
你姑妈是蛮积极努力工作的人哦。
Your aunt is a hard worker.
”但不是每个人和她的想法一样。
But not everyone thought the same thing.
网上疯传菜价飙涨：连白菜都卖到了三十多一斤。
The price of frenzied online food is soaring: Even cabbage has sold more than 30 kilo.
实际上，每个区域供货量不同，涨幅的情况也不一样。
In fact, the volume of supplies varies from region to region, as does the rate of increase.
在“封城”那天，一个朋友准备得更早，从凌晨一点到早上七点，她成功买满了冰箱。
On the "Seal the City" day, a friend prepared even earlier, from 1 a.m. to 7 a.m., she succeeded in buying a refrigerator.
了解到肺炎的严重性后，众多武汉市民开始屯粮。
Knowing the severity of pneumonia, many Wuhan people began to store grain.
/@林晨同学Hearing之后，朋友发朋友圈感慨：“信息都在网上发布，老人太可怜了，我外婆根本不知道发生了什么。
/ @ Lin Chen classmate Hearing, friends hair friends sigh: "Information published online, the old man is so poor, my grandmother did not know what happened.
早上去买菜，很多老人抱怨菜怎么这么贵，就嫌弃地走掉了。
Go shopping in the morning, many old people complain how expensive the food is, they are disgusted to walk away.
”在我的家，父亲很少看微信群的内容，他也是最不在乎这次疫情的人。
In my family, my father rarely looked at the contents of the micro-message group, and he was the last person to care about the outbreak.
在市政府出台，公共场所必须佩戴口罩前，家人虽多次劝说，他仍不愿戴口罩出门。
He was reluctant to go out wearing a mask despite repeated attempts to persuade his family to do so.
每一天，疫情都有新的变化，但父亲执意坚持传统：在家里，如期举行爷爷的上香仪式。
Every day there were new changes in the epidemic, but my father was determined to stick to the tradition of holding a grandpa's incense service at home, as scheduled.
他们意识到需要多买一些口罩时，早就没有太多地方能买到了今天的上香，除了父亲外，全家人都显得有些忧心。
When they realized that they needed to buy more masks, there were not many places where they could buy the fragrance today. Except for their father, the whole family seemed worried.
我们无法预料，除夕夜过后，有多少人会登门拜访。
We can't predict how many people will call after New Year's Eve.
大姑妈出了预案，“出于礼貌，不能拒绝来上香的客人。
"My aunt made a plan." Out of politeness, you can't refuse an offer of incense.
我们都要戴口罩，跟来的人说声对不起，上完香后不能再招待你了。
We all have to wear masks and say sorry to the people who come. We can't serve you any more after we finish perfuming.
”但毕竟上香的地方，在我父亲的房子里，最终还是他说了算。
"But where it was incense, in my father's house, he had the final say.
昨天，他去买好了糖，用来招待留下来坐一坐的人。
Yesterday he went and bought some sugar to entertain the people who stayed behind.
在微信群里，我说给来的客人，发下口罩吧。
In the microphone group, I said to the visitor, put on the mask.
堂姐回复我，家里的口罩没那么多。
Cousin replied to me, the family mask is not so much.
我没多想，也没细问。
I didn't think about it, I didn't ask.
肺炎面前，不能掉以轻心，一定要戴口罩。
Pneumonia front, cannot drop lightly, must wear mask.
/unsplash父亲是一个很沉默又固执的人。
My father was a very quiet and stubborn man.
对于年夜饭取消，他有些失落。
He was a little frustrated at the cancellation of New Year's Eve dinner.
作为长子的他，平日很少关注亲人，但他不太希望过去的大家庭，因为父母的去世“就这么散了”。
As the eldest son, he paid little attention to his relatives, but he did not want to have a large family because his parents' death "just went away.
他也希望，我们能尊敬来上香的客人。
He also hoped that we would respect the guests who had come to us.
电话里，他有些不耐烦，“别人留下来，不能不招待吃饭吧？”昨天我给家人打了电话，才知道他们的物资非常紧缺。
On the phone, he was a little impatient. "Others stay, can't wait to have dinner?" I called my family yesterday and realized they were in dire need of supplies.
大姑妈家只有30只外科口罩，堂妹家有50只，我家里的口罩不到十只。
My aunt has only 30 surgical masks, my cousin has 50, and my family has fewer than 10.
这个数量，完全无法应对新年几天来的访客。
This amount is completely inadequate for New Year's Day visitors.
几天前，妈妈还在微信里回复我，“够用了”。
A few days ago, my mother replied in a letter, "Enough is enough."
身处前线抗击肺炎的医护人员，同样需要口罩。
Medical staff in the front line fighting pneumonia also need face masks.
/@2020央视春晚比起眼前的疫情，妈妈更关心我新年的安排，微信里反复问我：“新年一个人过，会不会太无聊了？”“你可以提前回北京，我和一个朋友讲好了，可以去她家过年。
/ @ 2020 CCTV Spring Festival Gala compared to the current situation, my mother is more concerned about my New Year's agenda, repeated in the micro-letters: "Will it be too boring to live alone in the New Year?" "You can go back to Beijing ahead of schedule.
”“在外面要照顾好自己呀。
"Take care of yourself outside.
”堂妹告诉我，“这周二在药店还能买到口罩，第二天去都卖完了。
"My cousin told me," I could still get a mask at the drugstore on Tuesday, and I sold it out the next day.
”我在朋友圈问了一圈，发现身边很多朋友都存在口罩短缺的问题。
I went around the circle of friends and noticed that many of my friends were suffering from a shortage of face masks.
最近这几天，他们意识到需要多买一些口罩时，早就没有太多地方能买到了。
In recent days, when they realized they needed to buy more masks, they didn't have many places to buy them.
听到家里口罩紧缺，我内心有些自责，早在12月31日，我就转了“肺炎”的新闻到群里，发了几个购买口罩的链接。
As early as December 31, I turned to the Pneumonia news and posted several links to purchase masks.
接下来的这段时间，我每天花很多时间，了解最新的动态，不断在朋友圈刷屏。
During the rest of the day, I spent a lot of time keeping abreast of the latest developments and constantly scrubbing screens around my friends.
在微信上，我多次告诉长辈们要戴口罩，但却忘记了应该亲自给他们买好要用的口罩。
Many times I told my elders to wear masks, but I forgot that I should buy them masks myself.
这几天，人在外地的我一直很焦虑，频繁地刷着手机信息。
These days, people in the field I have been very anxious, frequently brushing mobile phone information.
在酒店的床上，我久久不愿意起床，一次梦到了大家一起吃饭，爷爷就坐在我的身边。
In the hotel bed, I do not want to get up for a long time, a dream to eat together, Grandpa sat next to me.
他笑眯眯地看着我，关照我倒一点饮料喝（他不喜欢孙子喝酒）。
He looked at me with a smile and told me to pour me a drink (he didn't like his grandson to drink).
醒来后，我觉得有些难过。
When I woke up, I felt a little sad.
那天，这个海边城市阳光充沛，好像什么也没发生过一样。
It was a sunny day in this seaside city, as if nothing had happened.
这天是农历二十九日，刚好是我爷爷的生日。
It was the 29th of the lunar calendar and it was my grandpa's birthday.
昨晚，我预订了好几单口罩，然而几分钟后就收到了商家的退货信息。
Last night, I ordered several masks, but a few minutes later I received a return message from the store.
只有这一单——一共30个外科口罩，加上配送费200多元，次日送达。
Only this one - a total of 30 surgical masks, plus a delivery fee of more than 200, arrived the next day.
原本我不太抱希望，然而今天早上九点，我打开了外卖平台软件，地图上显示“骑手在配送”。
I wasn't very hopeful, but this morning at 9: 00, I turned on the take-out platform software and the map showed "riders delivering."
妈妈告诉我收到了口罩。
Mother told me I had received the mask.
她发来一张照片，里面是两盆洗好的蒜苔和豌豆，她在准备午饭了。
She sent a picture of two pots of garlic and peas, which she was preparing for lunch.
无论再难，这个新年终究会过去。
No matter how hard it is, the New Year will pass.
/赵景宜我稍微放下了些心，最坏的情况下，在网购的100多个外科口罩到来前，我的家人还靠着这些，度过一个难捱的新年了。
At worst, before the arrival of the more than 100 surgical masks bought online, my family has had to cope with this by hook or by crook.
我希望更多物资能输送到武汉，希望父母、家人、朋友、每一个武汉人，包括受“疫情”影响的其他地方的人，都能平平安安。
I hope that more materials can be delivered to Wuhan, hope that parents, family, friends, every Wuhan people, including other places affected by the "epidemic" can be safe.
希望过年期间，大家比我更有耐心与长辈沟通，尽可能取消聚会。
I hope that during the New Year, we have more patience than me to communicate with elders, as far as possible cancel the party.
