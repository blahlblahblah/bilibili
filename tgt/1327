刘为勇是我的大学同学。
Liu Wei-yong is my college classmate.
如今他是华中科技大学同济医学院附属同济医院检验科一员，发生疫情以来，他一直在抗击新冠病毒的第一线。
He is now a member of the Tongji Hospital Examiner's Department attached to Tongji Medical College of the Central University of Science and Technology.
他是新冠病毒的最早鉴定者之一。
He was one of the first experts on the new crown virus.
在 1 月 4 日，他就在大学群里提醒大家不要去菜市场买野味，因为基因测序结果出来了。
On January 4, he warned people in the university group not to go to the Halles to buy game, because the results of gene sequencing came out.
他当时没有言明的是可能为新型冠状病毒。
What he did not say at the time was that it might be a new coronavirus.
我本来早就打算联系他了解情况，看到他在群里说了一句 “我话不能说太多” 而作罢。
I had intended to contact him to find out what had happened and to see him say in the group "I can't say too much."
直到最近他接受了中国科学报采访。
Until recently he was interviewed by the China Science newspaper.
这篇《武汉 “硬核” 博士：我与新冠病毒打交道的日夜》的报道让同学群热闹多了些，大家纷纷点赞。
This "hard core" Wuhan: I deal with the new crown virus day and night "coverage of the students more lively, everyone praised.
于是想，该联系他了。
So I thought it was time to contact him.
他实在太忙了。
He is too busy.
我下午 2 点多发微信约他，晚上 10 点 48 分才有回音。
I picked him up at 2: 00 p.m. and didn't hear from him until 10: 48 p.m.
然后到凌晨 2：32，他回信说：刚到家洗完澡。
Then at 2: 32 a.m., he replied, Just got home and took a bath.
一天一百多样本大年初三，他当天做了 100 多份样本的检测。
One day more than 100 samples of the New Year's Day, he did more than 100 samples of the test.
我能想象到他每天的工作场景。
I can imagine his work every day.
换工作鞋、七步洗手、穿戴连体防护服、护目镜、N95 口罩、三层防护手套，穿戴整齐差不多 20 分钟。
Change shoes, wash hands seven times, wear overalls, goggles, N95 mask, three layers of protective gloves, and dress neatly for about 20 minutes.
检验工作是从拿到标本开始的，核酸提取、合成扩增、检验结果判定、信息录入、判断阳性率以及上传报告。
Testing begins with the taking of samples, nucleic acid extraction, synthesis amplification, test results determination, information entry, positive rate judgment and uploading of reports.
样本的处理在生物安全柜中进行，狭小的空间里需要操作人员要长时间保持固定姿势，吸管取样要求精细，每次取样、加样要精确到几微升。
Sample handling takes place in biosafety cabinets, where operators are required to maintain a fixed position for long periods of time, and sucker sampling requires precision, with each sampling and sample addition accurate to a few liters.
刘为勇说，这是检测中最耗体力的步骤。
'It's the most physical step in the process, 'Mr. Liu said.
每次检测样品处理（灭活、取样）需要 90 分钟，核酸扩增（PCR）需要两个半小时，这样加起来就要差不多 4 个小时。
Each sample treatment (inactivation, sampling) takes 90 minutes, and nucleic acid amplification (PCR) takes two and a half hours, which adds up to almost four hours.
加上写报告和上传报告，差不多就是 5 个小时之多，这也正是防护服的使用时间。
Together with report writing and uploading reports, it takes about five hours, which is how protective clothing is used.
在这 5 个小时里，他们不能吃饭，不能喝水，不能上厕所。
During these five hours, they could not eat, drink water or use the toilet.
更糟的是，整个人在狭小的空间里身着密闭的防护服，几个小时下来满身是汗。
To make matters worse, the man was in a cramped cell in a sealed suit, sweating for hours.
水汽凝结在护目镜上，还阻碍了视线。
The water vapor condenses on the goggles, also blocking the view.
图 | 同济医院检验科的同事们。
Colleagues at Tongji Hospital Laboratory Unit.
（来源：同济医院检验科微信公众号）他们检验科有 16 个人，人手还算够用，然而机器（核酸提取仪）不够用。
(Source: Microcredit Public Number, Tongji Hospital Inspection Division) There are 16 people in their laboratory. They have enough manpower, but the machines (nucleic acid extractors) are not enough.
于是他们分了两拨轮班倒，机器不停。
So they divided the two shifts, the machine did not stop.
我问他，除了防护服，他们还有哪些措施保证个人安全的？在样本到实验室之后，第一件事情就是把标本灭活，灭活方式是 56 摄氏度烤箱烤 1 个小时，这样标本就失去了活性。
I asked him what measures they had to take to ensure personal safety other than protective clothing, and the first thing they did after the samples arrived was to inactivate the specimen, which was roasted in an oven at 56 degrees Celsius for an hour so that the specimen would be inactivated.
所有操作都要在生物安全柜中进行，操作过程要轻柔避免飞溅。
All operations should be carried out in biosafety cabinets, the operation process should be gentle to avoid splashing.
核酸提取是机器全自动提取，这也是尽量避免操作者的暴露风险。
Nucleic acid extraction is the automatic extraction of machines, which also minimizes the risk of operator exposure.
操作间都是单独使用，有防污染隔离区。
The operation room is used separately, has the pollution-proof quarantine zone.
所有产生的污物必须高压灭菌后才能运出实验室。
All the generated dirt must be sterilized before it can be taken out of the laboratory.
桌面、仪器、固定设施及地面至少每日采用消毒液擦拭。
Clean table top, instrument, fixture and ground with disinfectant at least daily.
PCR 实验结束后紫外照射房间及相关设施以消除核酸污染，同时杀灭病毒。
After the PCR experiment, UV irradiated the room and related facilities to eliminate nucleic acid pollution and kill the virus.
一些步骤能减少手工操作的尽量减少。
Some steps can reduce the amount of manual work you can do.
比如，自动核酸提取的时候，采用带病毒保存液的咽拭子或鼻咽拭子可避免开盖添加生理盐水的步骤。
For example, when automatic nucleic acid extraction, pharyngeal swab or nasopharyngeal swab with viral preservation fluid can avoid the steps of adding saline to the lid.
他们还在自己的微信公众号发布了《我们的经验：新冠病毒检测常见问题处理》，阅读数达到了 7 万之多，也被多个专业账号转载。
They also published "Our Experience: Frequently Asked Questions about New Crown Virus Detection" on their microphone public page, which reached 70,000 readers and was reprinted by a number of professional accounts.
目前，他们每上一天班就会休息一天，而采样人员则是上一周，休一周。
Currently, they take a day off for every day they work, while the samplers take a week off the previous week.
采样人员的休息其实是被隔离在宾馆，防止造成家人感染。
The rest of the samplers was actually isolated in the hotel to prevent the infection of the family.
目前他的工作其实没原来紧张了，更多实验操作的事情交给了更年轻的同事，他会做一些指导工作。
At the moment, his job isn't as stressful as it used to be. More experimental work is being done by younger colleagues, who will do some coaching.
他们需要分辨疑似患者。
They need to identify suspected patients.
其实试剂盒都有判断说明书，如果 PCR 扩增曲线不规则，只出来 1 个扩增点，即 1 个靶标，那么就都要发疑似报告。
In fact, the kit has a diagnosis specification, if the PCR amplification curve is irregular, out of only one amplification point, that is, a target, then suspect reports will be issued.
疑似病例他们会建议重新采样检测。
In suspected cases they will recommend re-sampling and testing.
如果出现两个峰，PCR 扩增曲线很典型，那么就是阳性。
If two peaks occur and the PCR amplification curve is typical, then it is positive.
阳性报告直接上报给武汉市卫健委。
Positive reports were reported directly to Wuhan Health Commission.
他说，这几天样本检测量还在攀爬，他们科室的样本检测量最高纪录到了一天 900 份。
Sample testing has been climbing over the past few days, reaching a record of 900 samples a day in his department, he said.
最早发现者之一刘为勇所在科室是最早发现新冠病毒的团队之一。
One of the earliest discoverers, Liu Zyong, was one of the first teams to discover the new crown virus.
1 月 2 号拿到标本，4 日他就在群里提醒同学了。
On January 2nd he got the specimen, and on the 4th he reminded his classmates in the group.
两个标本来自其他医院，临床怀疑是 SARS 肺炎。
Two specimens from other hospitals were clinically suspected of SARS pneumonia.
彼时武汉的 8 个医生已经在网上上传了写有 SARS 病毒阳性的检测报告，刘为勇所在科室看到过这个报告后，就让中南医院合作伙伴进行了检测。
By then, eight Wuhan doctors had posted an online test report that said the virus was positive, and Liu's office had read the report and asked its partners to test it.
因为合作伙伴只有 SARS 试剂盒，然后就又做了逆转录—聚合酶链反应（RT-PCR），发现是 SARS 阳性。
It was found to be SARS-positive because the partner only had a SARS kit and then made a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
这时候需要确定是不是冠状病毒突变，他们就进行了测序。
To determine if the coronavirus mutated, they sequenced the coronavirus.
一代测序和二代测序同时进行。
Generation sequencing and second-generation sequencing went hand in hand.
刘为勇设计了一代测序里的 6 对聚合酶链式反应（PCR）引物，但只有 1 对引物成功了。
Liu designed six pairs of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers from a generation of sequencing, but only one pair of primers succeeded.
5 对引物失败，正是因为他们选取的是 SARS 的模板。
The primers failed precisely because they chose the SARS template.
加上二代测序结果，他们得出结论，这是一个新发现病毒，和 SARS 病毒接近。
Together with second-generation sequencing results, they concluded that it was a newly discovered virus, close to the SARS virus.
我好奇地问，你们怎么没有抢着发论文呢，这可是大好机会？刘为勇说，是不是第一个得到这个病毒序列他们不能确定，但他们很好奇，SARS 病毒已经被消灭了怎么还会出现？于是第一个反应就是报告到中国疾控中心。
'I asked curiously, 'Why didn't you get the paper, it was a great opportunity?' Liu said. 'They weren't sure if they were the first to get the sequence, but they were curious how the SARS virus could have been eliminated.
他们把序列信息也上报给了中国疾控中心，这得到了对方的点赞，称同济医院非常无私，非常有责任感。
They also reported the sequence to the CDC, which was praised for its selflessness and sense of responsibility.
刘为勇说，一般那个序列是不会轻易给别人，而“我们是没有任何犹豫的”。
Liu said that generally that sequence is not easy to give to others, and "we are not any hesitation."
他们这个团队来自多家机构，还包括武汉大学病毒学国家重点实验室、中南医院、中山大学的科研人员。
Their team comes from a number of institutions, including Wuhan University Virology National Key Laboratory, Zhongnan Hospital, Zhongshan University researchers.
如今相关论文投给了国际期刊《新发病原体与感染》（Emerging Microbes & Infections）。
Now the paper has been presented in the international journal Emerging Infections & amp; Infections.
他们承担了传染病防治专项课题，要与中国疾控中心联防联控。
They have undertaken the special topic of infectious disease prevention and control, with the China CDC joint control.

（来源：同济医院检验科）新冠病毒疫情来了，他们并没有惊慌失措。
(Source: Tongji Hospital Examinations Unit) The outbreak of the new crown virus has come, and they are not panicked.
在他们科室 16 名技术人员中有 5 名博士，此前已经有了比较完善的新突发病毒鉴定体系。
Among the 16 technical staff in their department, there are 5 PhDs, and there is already a fairly complete system for identifying new outbreaks of virus.
刘为勇说，成熟的测序技术很重要，他们平时有这种工作储备，可以在病毒袭来时立马能够上战场。
'Well-established sequencing technology is very important, 'Mr. Liu said.' They have this kind of work reserve to be ready to go to war as soon as the virus strikes.
刘为勇本人就做了很多病毒检测技术研发的工作。
Liu did a lot of research and development on virus detection technology.
因为他们也会遇到某个病毒没有中国药监局认证的试剂盒的情况，而临床医生和患者的需求又很急迫，这时候他们就会做研发，创建方法，比如说要引物、探针、PCR 扩充条件，解决好灵敏度、特异性、敏感性的问题。
Because they also encounter a virus without a Chinese Drug Administration-certified kit and the needs of clinicians and patients are urgent, they do research and development and create methods, such as primers, probes, PCR extensions, to solve sensitivity, specificity, and sensitivity problems.
在符合检测的标准要求之后，他们就会把这个项目推出去。
After meeting the test criteria, they would push the project out.
比如冠状病毒，在新冠病毒发生之前的 6 种可感染人的冠状病毒中，除了 SARS 和 MERS，其它 4 种冠状病毒的病毒方法学均已在 2017 年前后建好。
For example, the coronavirus, of the six coronaviruses that infect humans prior to the outbreak of the coronavirus, the virus methodology for the other four coronavirus has been developed since around 2017, except for SARS and MERS.
因为 SARS 病毒和 MERS 病毒没有阳性标本，当时认为不会再复发，他们就没有创建其病毒学方法。
They did not create virology because the SARS virus and the MERS virus had no positive specimens and were thought not to recur.
他们在病毒样本中筛到了 3 例冠状病毒 HCoV-229E 标本，只是感染该病毒的患者症状都很轻。
They sifted three samples of the coronavirus HCoV-229E in the virus samples, although the symptoms were mild in all patients infected with the virus.

（来源：刘为勇）4 年大学生涯，我和刘为勇不记得有接触。
(Source: Liu for Yong) 4 years of university career, I do not remember contact with Liu Chengyong.
我们是华中师范大学生命科学学院的不同系，我是生物科学专业，他是生物技术专业。
We are different departments of the School of Life Sciences of Central China Normal University.
印象中他个子不高，戴眼镜，平时一副严肃的表情。
The impression is that he is not tall, wearing glasses, usually a serious expression.
他是湖北孝感汉川人，毕业后进入武汉大学病毒学国家重点实验室攻读研究生，博士课题是《南昌与武汉地区手足口病分子流行病学调查研究》。
He is a Hubei filial piety Han Chuan, after graduation into Wuhan University virology national key laboratory for postgraduate studies, PhD topic is "Nanchang and Wuhan region hand, foot and mouth disease molecular epidemiology research."
之后进入同济医院检验科做博士后工作，随后留下。
After entering Tongji Hospital Inspection Department to do post-doctoral work, and then stay.
这些信息是我这几天天搜索才知道的。
I've been searching for this information for days.
不过我们很早就有意见面聊一聊，因为他在毕业后曾与我有过一点接触。
But we were interested in meeting for a chat early, because he had some contact with me after graduation.
那是 2013 年基因农业网发起《就 “财经郎眼” 和“解码财商”造谣转基因事件致国家广电总局的公开信》时，刘为勇联系到我，说希望联署签名。
When Gene Agriculture Network launched an open letter to the State Administration of Radio, Television and Radio in 2013 about the rumor "Caijing Lang Eyes" and "Decode Financial Quotient," Liu contacted me and said he wished to co-sign it.
当时他还是同济医院的博士后。
He was a postdoctoral fellow at Tongji Hospital.
之后是 2018 年，他来京有意见面聊聊，结果不巧我不在京。
Then in 2018, he came to Beijing to meet for a chat, only to find out that I was not in Beijing.
然后 2019 年我到武汉约他来同学聚会，结果他要替患流感的同事值班而未能如愿。
Then in 2019 I went to Wuhan to ask him to a classmate's party, only to be asked to stand by a colleague with the flu.
他的夫人也是医务工作者，这几天正在门诊岗位值班，那岗位比他的检验科还要高危。
His wife, also a medical worker, had been on duty at the outpatient clinic for several days, a position that was more dangerous than his examination department.
如今他一儿一女，儿子小学二年级，女儿还不满两岁，正是家庭压力大的时候。
Now he has a son and daughter, the second grade of elementary school, and his daughter is less than two years old.
我问他，武汉 “封城” 有什么影响？他却不太能回答，大概太专注业务了。
I asked him, Wuhan "closure" what impact? He is not very able to answer, presumably too focused on business.
只说，“封城”前一天去麦德龙扫了 2000 多元的储备，彼时方便面的货架已经空了。
Suffice it to say that the "Seal of the City" went to Metro the day before to sweep more than 2,000 yuan of reserves, when the instant noodles shelf was empty.
他说，最近又快该扫货了。
'It's almost time to sweep up, 'he says.
刘为勇在我们的同学群里跟他现实中一样低调、沉默，只有在最近疫情出现才冒了几句话，以及在被报道之后成为大家关注的焦点。
Liu was as low-key and silent as he actually was in our class, and only a few words emerged from the recent outbreak and became the focus of attention after being reported.
其实群里每天都会刷屏上百条信息，毕竟 130 多人的群里多数在湖北，主要集中在武汉。
In fact, the group will brush screen hundreds of messages every day, after all, more than 130 people in the group mostly in Hubei, mainly concentrated in Wuhan.
有的同学会转来各种消息，也有同学热衷解疑答惑。
Some students transfer to a variety of information, there are students eager to solve the puzzle.
比如有同学说，他的同事妈妈大年三十晚上患肺炎去世，医院说是新冠肺炎，现在死了医院却不承认，这就会导致治疗成为全自费，要补交七八万元；也有同学转发幼儿园老师的求助帖子，说亲属确诊新冠病毒肺炎却无法入院；也有同学说，村里打电话问从武汉哪里回乡的，回答是汉口火车站后，吓得旁边邻居赶紧躲避。
For example, one student said that his colleague's mother died of pneumonia on the evening of New Year's Eve, and the hospital said it was New Year's Eve pneumonia, but now the hospital refuses to admit it.
我问了几个同学，武昌的同学还好，物价不算太高。
I asked several students, Wuchang students are okay, prices are not too high.
汉口的同学受影响最大，因为武汉华南海鲜批发市场就在汉口火车站附近。
Hankou students were the most affected, as Wuhan South China Seafood Wholesale Market is near Hankou Railway Station.
那里的人们会受到更多的歧视对待。
People there will be subjected to more discrimination.
武汉同学最担心的不是 “封城” 带来的生活不便，而是家人要是有感染能不能顺利入院。
Wuhan students most worried about the "closure" brought about by the inconvenience, but if the family can be infected with a smooth hospital.
刘为勇说，据他了解，有两个认识的同事也被感染，不过好消息是已经接近康复。
'To his knowledge, two colleagues he knows have also been infected, but the good news is that they are nearing recovery, 'Mr. Liu said.
他说，“如果我们科任何人因为工作感染了，我们肯定是尽全力给他医护保障，让他消除后顾之忧。
"If anyone in our department gets infected because of work, we will do everything we can to give him medical care and make him worry-free," he said.
”至少在和我的通话中，刘为勇没有某些医院那种 “捐躯赴国难” 的壮烈言语，也没有什么忧心的表达，都是平平淡淡的日常，一如他们平时的工作状态。
"At least on the phone with me, Liu did not have some of the hospital's" sacrifice to the national tragedy "of the heroic words, and no expression of concern, are ordinary everyday, as they usually work.
