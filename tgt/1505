文：孙煜 何苗编辑：陈臣“ 一线城市中，北京上周拥堵指数较去年一季度水平下降最多，5个工作日拥堵指数的平均降幅为42.93%。
In first-tier cities, Beijing's congestion index dropped the most last week from last year's level, the average five-day congestion index fell by 42.93%.
”2月17日，《环球时报》题为《大多数城市不应再继续“静止”下去了》的评论称，“一个上千万人口的大城市因为每天很个别受到追踪的病例而让街道空荡荡的，对这种情况我们应当自嘲，并且打破之。
"A big city of tens of millions of people who leave the streets empty because of very few cases being tracked every day should laugh at itself and break it," the Global Times said on Feb. 17.
”那么，复工首周各个城市出门的人到底多不多？道路交通方面，界面数据记者选取了北京、上海、广州、深圳、天津、重庆、杭州、南京、成都、沈阳、长沙、西安、郑州、苏州、宁波、青岛等十六个城市，将2月10-15日百度智慧地图各城市的高峰拥堵指数，与2019年一季度各城市通勤高峰拥堵指数对比，来观察城市道路交通的拥堵程度。
In terms of road traffic, the reporter chose 16 cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Chongqing, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Chengdu, Shenyang, Changsha, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Suzhou, Ningbo and Qingdao.
一线城市中，北京上周拥堵指数较去年一季度水平下降最多，5个工作日拥堵指数的平均降幅为42.93%。
Among first-tier cities, the Beijing congestion index fell the most last week from last year's level, with an average of 42.93 per cent for five working days.
深圳的降幅最小，5个工作日的拥堵指数较去年一季度平均下降31.97%。
Shenzhen saw the smallest drop, with a 31.97 per cent drop in the five-working-day congestion index from the first quarter of last year.
其他十四个城市中，重庆的下降幅度最大。
Chongqing fell the most among the other 14 cities.
据百度地图数据，去年一季度重庆是全国最堵的城市，通勤高峰拥堵指数达2.251。
According to Baidu's map, Chongqing was the most congested city in the country last quarter, with a peak commuter congestion index of 2.251.
上一周，重庆工作日的高峰拥堵指数则在1.03-1.04间浮动，5天平均降幅达54.15%。
Last week, Chongqing's peak congestion index fluctuated between 1.03 and 1.04, with an average five-day drop of 54.15 per cent.
和去年一季度相比，十四城中下降幅度最小的是宁波。
Compared with the first quarter of last year, the smallest decline in 14 cities was in Ningbo.
宁波上周五个工作日平均降幅为22.39%。
Ningbo posted an average 22.39% decline on Friday.
在疫情防控期间，全国有多个城市实行了道路交通管制措施，停运道路公共交通（如杭州）或减少客运班次。
During the period of epidemic prevention and control, road traffic control measures were implemented in several cities throughout the country, stopping public transport by road (such as Hangzhou) or reducing passenger traffic.
与此同时，北京、天津等城市则暂停实行机动车尾号限行，以鼓励私家车出行。
At the same time, Beijing, Tianjin and other cities have suspended the introduction of vehicle tail restrictions to encourage private cars to travel.
城市轨道交通方面，界面数据记者根据公开资料，将上述十六个城市2月10-15日的地铁客流强度，与去年农历同日客流强度对比。
Urban Rail Transit Interface Data Reporters used open data to compare the intensity of subway traffic in the 16 cities mentioned above on February 10-15 with that of last year's lunar calendar.
结果显示，十六个城市平均客流强度降幅达93.69%。
The results showed that the average passenger flow decreased by 93.69% in 16 cities.
四个一线城市的地铁客流强度降幅均在90%左右。
The four first-tier cities have all seen a drop of about 90 per cent in subway traffic.
深圳的地铁客流强度下降最大，正月十七至二十二日6天的地铁客流强度较去年同期下降了92.95%，北京的地铁客流强度降幅也超过90%，达92.87%。
Shenzhen experienced the biggest drop in subway traffic intensity, down 92.95 percent over the same period last year. Beijing also experienced a drop of more than 90 percent, to 92.87 percent.
四个一线城市外，界面数据记者统计的其他十四个城市上周的客流强度，平均降幅均超90%。
Outside the four first-tier cities, interfacial data reporters calculated that the other 14 cities last week saw an average drop in passenger flow of more than 90%.
西安的地铁客流强度下降幅度最大，上周客流强度较去年同期下降96.68%。
Xi'an experienced the sharpest drop in subway traffic, with passenger flow last week down 96.68 per cent from the same period last year.
降幅最小的青岛，地铁客流强度较去年同期也下降了91.51%。
Qingdao, the city with the smallest drop, also saw its passenger-flow strength drop 91.51% from a year earlier.
和道路交通管制类似，在疫情防控期间，多个城市也出台了轨道交通管制措施。
Similar to road traffic control, during the period of epidemic prevention and control, several cities have introduced rail traffic control measures.
如宁波市自2月6日起暂停轨道交通运营，2月15日才逐步恢复运营。
If the city of Ningbo from February 6 suspension of rail operations, February 15 only gradually resumed operations.
2月15日当天，宁波地铁客流强度较去年同期下降93.62%。
On Feb. 15, passenger flow in Ningbo was down 93.62% from the same period last year.
上海、天津等多个城市在春节期间采取停运部分路段或关闭部分站点的方式限行。
Shanghai, Tianjin and other cities during the Spring Festival to stop part of the road or to close some of the way station restrictions.
此外，北京、广州等城市也出台措施严控地铁满载率。
In addition, Beijing, Guangzhou and other cities also introduced measures to strictly control the rate of subway full load.
城市道路及轨道交通流量下降幅度大，背后有多种原因。
There are many reasons for the large decline of urban road and rail traffic.
一方面，许多城市出台隔离或封闭式管理政策，叠加交通限行措施，降低了城市居民的出行量。
On the one hand, many cities have put in place isolated or closed management policies that superimpose traffic restrictions and reduce the number of trips made by urban residents.
另一方面，目前仍有大量流动人口尚未返回城市，城市人口总数较往年同期偏低。
On the other hand, there are still large numbers of migrants who have not returned to the cities, whose population is lower than in previous years.
2月15日，交通运输部在国新办新闻发布会上透露，截至2月14日，节后（1月25日至2月14日）全国共发送旅客2.83亿人次、日均1348万人次，同比分别下降82.3%，仅为春运客流的六分之一。
On 15 February, the Ministry of Transport revealed at a new press conference that, as of 14 February, 283 million passengers and 13.48 million daily trips had been dispatched nationwide since the holiday (25 January to 14 February), a decrease of 82.3 per cent year-on-year and only one sixth of the passenger flow.
据预测，农民工到2月底将要返程约1.2亿人次，3月以后返程约1亿多人次，待返校的学生客运量约为1亿人次。
It is estimated that about 120 million migrant workers will have returned by the end of February, about 100 million since March and about 100 million by the time they return to school.
近日来，已有福建、海南、浙江、安徽、江西等多个省份出台“分级分区”的差异化防控政策。
In recent days, Fujian, Hainan, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi and other provinces have introduced "graded zoning" differentiated prevention and control policy.
在疫情数据好转、防控更加精准的形势下，城市路上的人会越来越多。
With better epidemiological data and more precise control, more people will be on the road to the city.
