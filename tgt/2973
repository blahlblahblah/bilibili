澎湃新闻记者 蒋馨尔 王亚赛1月5日，湖北武汉，一位61岁的女性开始发热。
A 61-year-old woman begins feverish in Wuhan, Hubei Province, January 5, 2007.
3天后，她将跟随旅行团直飞泰国。
After 3 days, she will follow the tour group to Thailand.
1月13日，这位中国女性在泰国被确诊感染新冠病毒。
The Chinese woman was diagnosed with the new crown virus in Thailand on January 13.
这是目前人们所知新冠肺炎海外传播的起点。
This is now known as the new crown pneumonia overseas spread of the starting point.
3月4日，新冠肺炎的海外传播发酵近两月，六大洲、76个国家先后发现了新冠病毒的“足迹”。
The virus has been found in 76 countries and six continents in the past two months.
截至3月4日24时，除中国外，13753例病患被先后确诊，232人因此失去生命。
As at 2400 hours on March 4, 13,753 patients had been diagnosed and 232 had lost their lives, excluding China.
这一切是如何开始的？澎湃新闻（www.thepaper.cn）通过一组地图进行回顾。
How did all this begin? The surging news (www.thepper.cn) was reviewed through a set of maps.
1月，亚洲多国陆续出现输入性病例，疫情继而蔓延至北美、欧洲和大洋洲。
In January, there were a number of imported cases in Asia, which spread to North America, Europe and Oceania.
2月上中旬，除了疫情暴发的“钻石公主”号，新冠病毒入侵脚步一度趋于缓和，2月1日至20日，仅攻破4个国家。
In mid-February, apart from the outbreak of the Princess Diamond, the New Crown Virus invasion slowed down, breaking only four countries between February 1 and 20.
2月20日后，韩国、意大利、伊朗疫情不断升级，全球步入新一轮疫情扩张期。
After Feb. 20, the South Korean, Italian and Iranian epidemics escalated, and the world entered a new period of epidemic expansion.
从1例到13753例，从1国到76国，除了总括性数据，我们还能发掘哪些不容忽视的传播模式和应对方法？对此，澎湃新闻寻找4组切片，韩国的社区传播、伊朗和意大利的跨国传播、流浪邮轮上的不确定传播以及各国政府抗疫行动，试着回顾全球疫情演变过程。
From one case to 13,753, from one country to 76 countries, what other modes of transmission and how to deal with them should not be overlooked? In response, there were four sections of surging news, community spread in Korea, transnational spread in Iran and Italy, uncertain spread on vagrant cruise ships, and government action against the epidemic.
社区传播，陡然加速疫情发展至今，新冠病毒的传播方式已经从境外输入过渡到了社区传播和集中感染，多国开始报告传染途径不明的确诊病例，确诊人数也一路攀升。
Community transmission has accelerated the epidemic so far, the transmission of the new crown virus has been imported from abroad to community transmission and concentrated infection, many countries began to report the confirmed cases of unknown transmission routes, and the number of confirmed cases is rising.
在全球加速的社区传播中，韩国可以说是最典型的国家之一。
South Korea is one of the most typical countries in the accelerating global community spread.
韩国国内的社区传播，最初是在2月17日被注意到的。
Community communication in South Korea was first noted on February 17.
这一天，大邱市一名60岁的女性被确诊，这是韩国确诊的第31号病例。
On that day, a 60-year-old woman was diagnosed in Daegu, the thirty-first case confirmed in South Korea.
她是大邱市新天地教会的成员，在确诊之前，曾四次前往当地的新天地教会参加活动，其中两次是在出现症状之后，与其同属同一空间者前后达到1000多人。
She was a member of the Church of Xintiandi in Daegu city. Before her diagnosis, she visited the local Church of Xintiandi on four occasions, two of which reached more than 1,000 people in the same space after the onset of symptoms.
第二天，韩国新确诊了12位与“第31号病患”有过接触的新冠肺炎患者，其中1人为东方诊所的员工，其余11人都是新天地教会的成员。
The next day, South Korea confirmed 12 new cases of New Crown Pneumonia who had come into contact with Patient 31, including one from the Eastern Clinic and the remaining 11 from Xintiandi Church.
更多新天地教会的信徒在后期被确诊，疫情也由最初的大邱市，蔓延至韩国多地。
More believers in Xintiandi Church were diagnosed later, and the outbreak spread from the original city of Daegu to South Korea.
跨国传播，全球蔓延社区传播加速的同时，新冠病毒在国与国之间传播加剧。
As global transmission accelerates, so does the spread of the new cap virus from country to country.
意大利、伊朗是现阶段跨国传播最典型的海外国家，欧洲、中东乃至美洲的防疫压力因此倍增。
Italy and Iran are the most typical overseas countries in transnational communication, and the pressure of epidemic prevention in Europe, the Middle East and even America has been doubled.
根据澎湃新闻（www.thepaper.cn）的不完全统计，截至3月3日24时，已有37个国家出现与意大利相关的新冠肺炎病例，其中22个国家的首例新冠肺炎由意大利输入。
According to incomplete statistics from the surging news (www.thepper.cn), as of 2400 hours on March 3, 37 countries had developed new cases of Italian-related pneumonia, with 22 of them importing Italy's first new crown pneumonia.
这些确诊患者或是近期去过意大利，或是近期去过意大利的确诊患者的妻子、儿子、兄弟、同事和朋友。
These confirmed patients are either wives, sons, brothers, colleagues and friends of confirmed patients who have recently been to Italy or who have recently visited Italy.
伊朗的情形也是类似，从伊朗返回的旅行者、差旅者、探亲者叩开了18国大门，近在相邻的阿富汗，远至加拿大和新西兰，126例与伊朗相关的新冠肺炎被确诊。
The situation is similar in Iran, where travellers, travellers or family members returning from Iran have opened 18 doors, close to neighbouring Afghanistan, as far as Canada and New Zealand, and 126 cases of Iran-related pneumonia have been confirmed.
卫生条件并不理想的中东各国抗疫局面由此升级，巴林、科威特、伊拉克等国与伊朗有关的确诊病例人数众多。
This has led to an escalation of the epidemic in countries in the Middle East where health conditions are not ideal, with a large number of confirmed cases related to Iran in Bahrain, Kuwait and Iraq.
值得一提的是，来自意大利和伊朗的输入性病例，也开始在中国出现。
It is worth mentioning that imported cases from Italy and Iran are also beginning to appear in China.
3月2日，著名侨乡浙江丽水青田报告了一例境外输入病例。
On March 2, a case of overseas importation was reported in Lishui Qingtian, Zhejiang Province.
患者王某在意大利贝加莫担任餐厅服务员。
Patient Wang works as a waitress in Bergamo, Italy.
2月16日起，王某出现咳嗽、头痛等症状，2月26日出发回国，途经莫斯科和上海，3月1日晚在青田确诊。
February 16, Wang Mou cough, headache and other symptoms, February 26 set out home, via Moscow and Shanghai, March 1 in Qingtian diagnosis.
第二天，与王某同行返回中国的6名亲友和餐厅同事依次确诊。
The next day, Wang returned to China with the six friends and restaurant colleagues in order to confirm the diagnosis.
另一位餐厅同事，搭乘不同航班回国，也在浙江被确诊。
Another restaurant colleague, who flew home on different flights, was also diagnosed in Zhejiang.
而仅在几天之前，丽水市刚刚庆祝17名新冠肺炎确诊病例全部出院，成为浙江首个清零的地级市。
Only a few days ago, the city of Yeshui had just celebrated the discharge of 17 confirmed cases of New Crown Pneumonia, making it the first city in Zhejiang Province to clear zero.
流浪邮轮，谁为传播买单区别于落在地面的社区传播和跨国传播，搭载多国乘客的国际邮轮，在疫情期间难靠岸、难上岸，为新冠病毒的海外传播制造了不少不确定因素。
Vagrancy cruise, who pay for the spread of the spread of the difference between the community on the ground and transnational spread, carrying multi-national passengers of international cruise ships, during the epidemic landing difficult, difficult to land, for the new crown virus spread abroad created a lot of uncertainty.
海上邮轮环境密闭且人口集中，再加上中央空调和下水管道可能带来的传染风险，只要存在一例确诊患者，其他人很难全身而退。
With a closed sea liner and a concentrated population, combined with the risk of contagion from central air conditioning and sewer lines, it is difficult for others to escape with one confirmed case.
在下船疏散过程中，如果防疫措施不到位，很可能对本国造成输入性感染。
In the evacuation process, if the epidemic prevention measures are not in place, is likely to cause imported infections in the country.
获准下船的海外乘客一般搭乘航班回国，考虑到核酸假阴性的存在，这种回流可能带来更大规模的全球传播。
Overseas passengers who are allowed to disembark generally travel home on flights, which, given the false-negative presence of nucleic acids, may lead to greater global transmission.
豪华邮轮“钻石公主”号发现有一例下船乘客确诊新冠病毒后，于2月3日提速赶到日本横滨港，没想到迎接它的，是在港口停船隔离16天的安排。
The luxury liner, Princess Diamond, spotted a case of disembarkation on February 3 and arrived at Yokohama port on February 3, only to be greeted by a 16-day quarantine.
在这期间，船上确诊人数越来越高，600余名确诊乘客先后下船送医。
During this period, the number of confirmed cases on board ships increased, with more than 600 confirmed passengers disembarking.
直到2月19日，“钻石公主”号上首批核酸阴性且无发热的乘客获准下船。
It was not until February 19 that the first Nucleic acid-negative and heat-free passengers aboard the Princess Diamond were allowed to disembark.
这些乘客下船后，有人再度确诊，比如2月22日央视报道，一名2月19日下船的日本女性乘客确认感染。
After the passengers got off the ship, it was confirmed again, such as on February 22 CCTV reported that a Japanese female passenger disembarked on February 19 confirmed the infection.
目前，来自“钻石公主”号确诊人数已超700人。
More than 700 people have been confirmed from the Princess Diamond.
而另一艘邮轮“威士特丹”号被多地港口拒绝入境，在海上漂了2周。
The other cruise ship, Rotterdam, was refused entry to a multi-port and floated for two weeks.
2月14日该船部分乘客最终在柬埔寨西哈努克城下船。
On 14 February, some of the ship's passengers finally disembarked in Sihanouk, Cambodia.
柬埔寨首相洪森亲自到港口欢迎，全程未戴口罩。
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen personally welcomed him to the port, wearing no face mask.
洪森还邀请邮轮乘客逛逛金边，他在Facebook上表示：“逛逛城市比待在令人感到无聊或害怕的旅馆房间更好”。
Hun Sen also invited cruise passengers to Phnom Penh, where he said: "It's better to visit the city than stay in a boring or scary hotel room."
不过，这种热情相待的做法事后被证明太过冒险。
However, this approach turned out to be too risky.
2月15日，一名首批上岸的83岁美国籍女乘客，在马来西亚被确诊感染新冠病毒。
On 15 February, an 83-year-old female passenger of the United States, who was first disembarked, was diagnosed with the New Crown virus in Malaysia.
像这样漂在海上的流浪邮轮并非孤例。
Vagrant cruise ships like this are not alone.
就在3月4日，美国加州州长加文·纽瑟姆在新闻发布会上表示，搭载过加州首位新冠死亡病例的“至尊公主”号上，有11名乘客和10名船员“出现症状”。
On March 4, California Governor Gavin Newsum told a news conference that 11 passengers and 10 crew members on board the Beatles, California's first new crown death, had "symptoms."
这一载有数百名乘客的邮轮目前并未靠岸。
The ship, which carries hundreds of passengers, is not docking.
加州方面正与美国疾控中心和当地的医疗保健合作伙伴共享邮轮乘客名单，美国疾控中心正对邮轮情况进行调查。
California is sharing a passenger manifest with the CDC and local health care partners, and the U. S. CDC is investigating the cruise situation.
各国行动，抗疫镜鉴在疫情发展前期，一些国家因为国情、政治生态、社会文化的影响，防疫举措左右摇摆。
In the early stage of the epidemic, some countries swayed because of the impact of national conditions, political ecology and social and cultural factors.
不过随着全球疫情进入迅猛扩张期，没有一个国家能完全置身事外。
But with the global epidemic entering a period of rapid expansion, no country is immune.
眼下，虽然没有各国需要完全遵循的疫情应对守则，但一些举措已经成为全球共识。
At the moment, while there is no code of conduct for epidemic response that countries need to fully follow, there is a global consensus on some initiatives.
韩国、伊朗、意大利、日本这四个海外新冠确诊病例最多的国家正在做些什么？从澎湃新闻的梳理来看，一方面是治，一方面是防。
South Korea, Iran, Italy, and Japan, the four countries with the highest number of confirmed cases overseas, are doing something about the roar of the news, both in terms of governance and prevention.
在治疗上，分级就医、新建医院是共通手段。
In the treatment, graded hospitals, new hospitals are common means.
在防疫上，通过隔离、停学、远程办公，取消大型集会、关闭公共场所等方式，减少人群集聚带来的病毒传播。
In terms of epidemic prevention, the spread of the virus caused by mass gatherings has been reduced through isolation, school suspension and telecommuting, as well as the cancellation of large gatherings and the closure of public places.
未来两周，可能出现全球疫情扩大或平息的关键拐点。
In the next two weeks, there could be a critical inflection point for the global epidemic to expand or subside.
在新冠肺炎这一场全球公共卫生事件中，没有桃花源和诺亚方舟，各国公共医疗防线将迎来严酷挑战。
Without Peach and Noah's Ark in a global public-health event, the public-health defense landscape will be severely challenged.
毕竟，病毒没有国界。
After all, viruses know no borders.
