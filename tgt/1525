The Shanghai Education Commission has set up online guidance for basic, secondary and higher education in accordance with the request of the Ministry of Education to "stop teaching and learning, and mobilize all forces to promote related work, including teaching staff selection and course recording, network platform construction, end service guarantee, concentration of teaching aids and construction of online teaching management system.
基础教育方面，由市级层面制定统一的覆盖全市中小学的教学方案。
In basic education, unified teaching programmes covering primary and secondary schools throughout the city are developed at the municipal level.
不同年级的教学方案，充分考虑了不同年龄段学生的身心发展和学习规律，每节课的长短、每天总课时的多少以及教学容量上都有所差别。
The curricula for different grades take full account of the physical and mental development and learning patterns of students of different age groups, the length of each lesson, the total number of class hours per day and the teaching capacity.
市教委按照“同一学段、同一课表、同一授课老师”的原则，组织了全市各学段、各学科一千多名优秀骨干教师按照课程标准录制相关课程。
In accordance with the principle of "the same period, the same curriculum and the same teaching teacher," the municipal education committee has organized more than 1,000 outstanding cadres and teachers from various departments and disciplines throughout the city to record relevant courses according to the curriculum standards.
这些课程以电视播放为主，包括有线电视和IPTV，共分为12个频道，从小学一年级到高中三年级每个年级一个频道，除了首播外，还会安排重播。

In primary schools, for example, online instruction for primary school children lasts 20 minutes per session, 15 minutes shorter than in traditional classroom instruction, which is set according to the pupils' own concentration of attention; the average number of hours per day is 5-6, so that the total number of hours per student per day does not exceed 2.

Lu Jing said that for students' online learning, students must not be forced to "punch a card" online every day, upload learning video and other hard requirements.
学生作业要符合在线学习的特点，避免简单地沿用在校学习期间布置作业的形式，防止增加学生和家长不必要的负担。
Students' homework should conform to the characteristics of online learning, avoid simply follow the form of assignment during the school study, and prevent unnecessary burden on students and parents.
在全市统一课表中，两堂课之间休息间隔至少为20分钟，会为学生安排眼保健操、广播体操，强化体育锻炼，保护视力，增强体魄。
In the city-wide unified curriculum, the interval between classes is at least 20 minutes, students will be arranged eye exercises, radio gymnastics, strengthen physical exercise, protect their eyesight, strengthen their physique.
在线学习不同于在校学习，在校学习时，老师是在学生面前，可以对学生起到一定的督促作用。
Online learning is different from learning in school, when the teacher is in front of students, can play a certain role in urging students.
而在线学习，在居家的环境中，更多依靠孩子的自觉。
On-line learning, in the home environment, rely more on the child's consciousness.
我们希望学生通过居家在线学习，能够学会自我管理、自主学习，动静结合、劳逸结合，养成良好的学习习惯。
