人类历史上每一场大的疫情，对于文化的影响都非常巨大。
Every major epidemic in human history has had a tremendous impact on culture.
我们应当通过这场国难，思考中国文化未来发展可能遇到的困境，努力将其转变为发展机遇。
Through this national tragedy, we should consider the difficulties that Chinese culture may encounter in the future and try to turn them into opportunities for development.

图为疫情期间在家读书。

呼吁大家重视传统文化，保卫母语尊严关于“风月同天”和“武汉加油”孰优孰劣？我并非强调二者的可比性，只是希望以此为切入点，呼吁大家重视传统文化，保卫母语尊严。
To what extent do you agree or disagreeI do not want to emphasize the comparability of the two, but I just want to use it as an entry point to call attention to traditional culture and safeguard the dignity of the mother tongue.
起因是我的好友盛静教授负责学术公众号“语言与安全”——其内容并不特别面向大众，是比较纯学术的，她邀请我撰稿，我答应了。
The reason was that my good friend Professor Shengjing was in charge of the academic public name "Language and Security" - not specifically for the general public, but rather purely academic. She invited me to write, and I agreed.
那天晚上我正好有空，差不多花了一个小时的时间，最后成文《为什么别人会写“风月同天”，而你只会喊“武汉加油”？》，给盛静拿去用了。
That night I happened to be free, almost spent an hour, the final written "Why other people will write" the same day, "and you will only shout" Wuhan refueling? ", Shengjing used.
坦白讲，我们从未想把这篇文章推成一个“爆款”，毕竟我的这篇文章也比较学术。
Frankly, we never tried to make this article a "bombshell," after all, my article was academic.
发表之后，舆情远非我们所能控制，从破十万到破百万只用了24个小时，整个过程一开始让我们很惊讶。
After the publication, public opinion was far beyond our control, and it took us only 24 hours from breaking one hundred thousand to one hundred thousand, and we were amazed at the beginning.
旋即引发了社会各界的关注，包括六神磊磊、胡锡进等大V又开始跟进，讨论这个现象。
Immediately aroused the attention of the community, including six God-Lei, Hu Xijin and other large V began to follow, discuss this phenomenon.
韩晗原文首发在公号“语言与安全”上我的文章实际上是探讨修辞问题，这是非常学术的范畴。
In fact, my article is about rhetoric, which is a very academic category.
后来听说，文章“走红”之后，一些海外媒体也介入讨论此事，个别评论措辞可能有些偏激，这些我都没有关注。
I was later told that some overseas media were also involved in the discussion after the article became "popular" and that the wording of individual comments might be extreme, which I did not pay attention to.
用罗兰·巴特的话讲，文章一旦写成，就是“作者已死”，人家怎么写读后感，作者没有资格干预。
In the words of Roland Bart, once written, the author is dead, and the writer has no right to intervene.
后来有一家地方媒体的官微发了一篇影响更大的评论，可能并非针对我那篇文章。
Then a local media official made a more influential comment, which may not have been directed at my article.
但我看了之后，唯一的感觉就是这篇评论在写作上有很多不足之处，起码修辞就有问题。
But after I read it, the only thing I felt was that the review had many shortcomings in its writing, at least in rhetorical terms.
后来CGTN记者杨学敏女士采访我，CGTN刊发了英文采访稿，我仍谈的是修辞问题，目的是立足传统文化，保卫汉语，这是我写这篇文章的初心。
Later, CGTN reporter Ms. Yang Xuemin interviewed me, CGTN published an interview in English, I still talk about rhetoric, the purpose of the traditional culture, to defend Chinese, this is the first time I wrote this article.
关于这个问题，我的立场是：“武汉加油”当然没问题，但我们不能只会说“武汉加油”，好的修辞是多元化的，这需要我们面向传统，培养汉语的语感与审美能力。
On this issue, my position is: "Wuhan refueling," of course, no problem, but we can not just say "Wuhan refueling," good rhetoric is diverse, which requires us to face tradition, to cultivate Chinese language sense and aesthetic ability.
因为疫情，取消了赴日旅行我的父亲是在武汉出生长大的，我在黄石出生长大的，两座城市相隔七十公里，日常生活有很多交集。
Because of the outbreak, my father was born and raised in Wuhan, I was born and raised in Yellowstone. The two cities are 70 kilometers apart and there is a lot of overlap in our daily life.
我念大学本科时在成都的西南民族大学，硕士在中国传媒大学，博士在武汉大学，博士毕业后，我在北京的中国科学院工作了两年，因为工作需要，又在美国住了将近一年，之后又去了深圳大学，工作了三年，十几年折腾了四五个城市和两个国家。
After graduating from Wuhan University, I worked in the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing for nearly another year. Then I went to Shenzhen University and worked for three years, tossing four or five cities and two countries.
韩晗在伊斯坦布尔国家博物馆如今，我“转会”母校武汉大学，也是响应了当时武汉市委书记陈一新同志提出“资智回汉”的倡议。
Han Han / Han / In Istanbul National Museum, I now transfer to my alma mater Wuhan University, in response to then Wuhan city secretary Comrade Chen Xin's initiative to return to Han Chinese wisdom.
不过，谁也没有想到，第一个学期刚刚结束，第二个学期尚未启程，大家就碰上了新冠肺炎疫情这么大的事件。
However, no one thought that the first semester had just ended, the second semester has not started, we have encountered the New Crown Pneumonia such an event.
这场疫情之前，我和妻子有年后赴日旅行的计划，初步计划是去京都、大阪和奈良，因为这些地方既有学界的朋友，也准备京都的书店去买一些旧书，目前我们的护照还在日本驻华大使馆。
Before the outbreak, my wife and I had plans to travel to Japan in a couple of years. Our initial plan was to go to Kyoto, Osaka and Nara, which have academic friends and are planning to buy some old books at Kyoto bookstores.
我们是原本计划回来过年的，过完年我们就从武汉飞大阪。
We had planned to come back for the New Year. We would fly from Wuhan to Osaka in the New Year.
疫情发生后，封城始料不及，如今我们一家人都“困”在黄石，日常生活虽有不便，但没有什么现实大问题。
After the outbreak of the outbreak, the unexpected, we are now "stranded" in Yellowstone, although the daily life is inconvenient, but there is no real big problem.
唯一觉得不太习惯的就是无法出门散步或慢跑了。
The only thing I'm not used to is walking or jogging.
我有日行万步的习惯，这个习惯已经坚持了十几年，以前在全国各地工作时，都有慢跑的习惯，像深大校园的绿道、清华校园内，都是我经常跑步、散步的地方，眼下却陷入了无路可走的局面，你说人在家里，能走到5000步就非常了不起了；真走到10000步，一定是“微信运动”的前三名，完全有可能被人误认为是“非法活动人群”，起了举报之心都有可能。
When I was working all over the country, I used to jog. I used to run and walk around the campus, but now I find myself in no way at all. You say that at 10000 steps, you must be in the top three of MicroSpaces.
好在吃饭问题在我家不是问题，食物供应充足，父母和我们在一起，我父亲去年底正好退休，他厨艺甚佳，目前是他在家里做大厨，所以吃饭问题上我很幸运，不会存在吃十多天泡面这种遭遇。
My parents were with us. My father retired at the end of last year, he is a very good cook, and now he is the chef at home.
至于精神生活方面，我和妻子都是大学老师，平常除了散步也是“宅日常”，现在也无非还是看书、看电影、写东西，然后给学生上网课。
As for my spiritual life, my wife and I are college teachers. Besides walking, we usually do nothing but read books, watch movies, write things, and give our students online lessons.
韩晗和妻子张萱于疫情期间唯一一次外出购买食材我任教的武汉大学，因地处疫情的中心区域，开学时间肯定要延后，且延后的时间或相对较长。
Han Han and his wife Zhang Xuan were the only time they went out to buy food materials during the outbreak.
而我看到，身边不少高校教师朋友，纷纷在朋友圈吐槽“网课”的不合理性，我与几位朋友闲聊之后，了解了大致情况。
And I saw that many college teachers and friends, in the circle of friends spit "net lessons" unreasonable, I chatted with a few friends, understand the general situation.
我身边很多同行，过年要回老家，有些朋友在武汉安家十几年了，回一趟老家等于度假，考虑也就一周左右的时间，而且又是赶春运。
Some friends have settled down in Wuhan for more than ten years. A visit to my hometown is tantamount to a holiday.
所以当时很多人离开武汉时，都是仓促离开，包括我在内。
So a lot of people left Wuhan at that time, are rushed to leave, including me.
谁也没想到年前会下一个漫长的“封城令”，所以很多同行返家过年时，笔记本电脑、移动硬盘、教案与资料等等，都没有带齐，现在要上网课，这对于大家来说，当然是一个不小的挑战，有些有孩子的同行，连孩子的练习册、课本也没带，只想带孩子回老家放松几天，现在小学生也要上网课，这下就穷于应付了。
No one expected the next long "closure" year, so many people returned home, laptop, mobile hard disk, teaching case and materials, and so on, it is no small challenge for everyone, some have children's workbooks, textbooks, just want to take their children back home to relax for a few days, now students have to cope with the Internet classes.
这方面，其实武汉大学考虑比较周到，不强制要求你用哪个网课平台，微信群也行。
In fact, Wuhan University to consider more thoughtful, do not force you to use which online course platform, micro-letter group is also OK.
但有些学校，尤其是中小学，听说一定要求某某平台，而有些平台对网络环境要求很高，一些乡村、偏远地区根本没有高速光纤或是4G覆盖，这对于很多老师、学生来说，确实是一个很大的现实问题。
However, some schools, especially primary and secondary schools, are told that a certain platform is required, and some platforms are very demanding for the network environment. Some rural and remote areas do not have high-speed fiber optic or 4G coverage at all, which is a very real problem for many teachers and students.
正在思考疫情对未来中国文化的影响2月17日下午，我在微信上“开讲”了新学期的第一课，主要给武汉大学新闻传播学院的学生们讲中国现代文学，方式是微信语音，然后在群里与同学分享电子书。
Discussing the impact of the epidemic on future Chinese culture On the afternoon of Feb. 17, I introduced the first lesson of the new semester, mainly to the students of Wuhan University School of Journalism and Communication, by microphonetics, and then shared e-books with my classmates.
目前我在武汉大学国家文化发展研究院工作，给武汉大学新闻传播学院的本科生授课。
At present, I work in Wuhan University National Institute of Cultural Development to teach undergraduate students of Wuhan University School of Journalism.
之所以请我来讲“中国文学（下）”，很重要一个原因是我的博士学位是中国现当代文学专业的，2007年我就加入了中国作家协会，目前我的研究是中国现代文化产业史，这与中国现代文学关系密切。
The reason why I was invited to talk about "Chinese Literature (Part II)" is that my PhD degree is a major in Chinese modern literature. In 2007, I joined the Chinese Writers Association.
我认为，新闻专业的学生，作为人格奠基的文学教育非常重要，中国现代文学史与中国新闻史的关系也非常密切。
I believe that journalism students, as the foundation of the personality of literature education is very important, the history of modern Chinese literature and the history of Chinese journalism is very close.
因此我想借此机会谈谈新闻与文学的关系，谈谈怎么理解中国现代文学与时代的联系，当然更想和大家一起谈谈，新闻人如何靠良知与“笔杆子”立身。
Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to talk about the relationship between journalism and literature, how to understand the relationship between modern Chinese literature and the times, and of course, would like to talk with you, journalists how to rely on conscience and "pen pole" stand.
这堂课之后，我觉得武汉大学新闻传播学院同学们的素质非常高，我预留了交流时间，大家都是大一的学生，提的问题却很专业，有些同学加了我的微信，追问了许多问题，我觉得线上授课的效果可能不一定比线下效果差。
After this class, I think the quality of the students of Wuhan University School of Journalism and Communication is very high, I reserved the exchange time, everyone is a freshman, ask professional questions, some students added my micro-letters, asked many questions, I think the online teaching may not be less effective than the off-line effect.
韩晗在微信上授课因为工作需要与个人学术兴趣，最近我一直在思考这场疫情对未来中国文化的影响。
Han Han teaches in microletters because of work and personal academic interests. Recently I have been thinking about the impact of this epidemic on Chinese culture in the future.
我有一个基本判断，这场疫情或将影响未来中国文化的发展走向。
I have a basic judgement that this epidemic may affect the future development of Chinese culture.
疫情是一面镜子，照出了我们这个社会里许多闪光或丑恶的东西。
The epidemic is a mirror that reflects many of the glittering or ugly things of our society.
一些问题看似是简单的伦理、道德或是法律问题，但却在根本上事关未来中国文化的走向，既包括修辞、舆情等微观问题，也包括国民性问题、国家文化形象传播与民族文化认同等宏大问题，这些问题有些迫在眉睫，但有些是需要从长计议的。
While some issues may seem to be simple ethical, moral or legal issues, they fundamentally affect the future direction of Chinese culture, including such issues as rhetoric and public opinion, as well as such big issues as the national character, the dissemination of national cultural images and national cultural identity.
因为我本人处于疫情的中央，又从事文化研究，所以我对疫情的感触尤其深刻。
I was particularly struck by the outbreak because I was in the middle of the epidemic and I was involved in cultural research.
人类历史上每一场大的疫情，对于文化的影响都非常巨大。
Every major epidemic in human history has had a tremendous impact on culture.
这在历史上都不鲜见，无论是十四世纪的英国黑死病，还是1910年代的世界大流感，这些公共卫生事件都深刻地改变了人类文化的发展方向，当然不能简单说它对文化的影响是好还是坏，文化不是经济更不是股票，其发展不能用简单的涨跌来衡量。
This is not unusual in history, whether the 14th century British Black Death, or the 1910 world influenza, these public health events profoundly changed the direction of human culture, of course, can not simply be said to affect culture is good or bad, culture is not an economy nor a stock, and its development cannot be measured by simple ups and downs.
作为研究者与写作者，我们应当通过这场灾难，思考中国文化未来发展可能遇到的困境，努力将其转变为发展机遇，并作出自己的判断与建议，这是我们时刻应去想、去做的事情。
As researchers and writers, we should think about the difficulties that Chinese culture may encounter in the future, try to turn them into development opportunities, and make our own judgments and suggestions.
