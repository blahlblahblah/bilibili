本报记者 李静 湖北广水报道2月2日凌晨3点，共青团广水市委干部陆伟和两名志愿者司机张耀清、刘宗文驾驶的大货车到达天津市西青区芦北口服务区，这是距离天津正达科技有限公司（以下简称“天津正达”）最近的服务区。
Li Jing Hubei Guangshui, a reporter, reported that on February 2 at 3 a.m., Lu Wei, a cadre of the Communist Youth League Guangzhou Municipal Committee, and two volunteer drivers, Zhang Yaoqing and Liu Zongwen, arrived at the service area of Lu Beikou in the Xicheng District of Tianjin City.
在服务区停下车，疲惫的两名司机在驾驶室后排睡着了，陆伟蜷在副驾驶室守候了一夜。
Stopped in the service area, tired drivers fell asleep in the back of the cab and Lu Wei curled up in the cockpit for a night.
夜渐深车窗被三个人呼出的暖气笼罩上了一层雾气，陆伟却感觉脚和腿越来越冷，为了不影响两名司机的休息，他尽量保持着同样的姿势。
At night, the windows were fogged by the three men's exhalation, but Lu Wei felt his feet and legs get colder and colder. He tried to maintain the same posture so as not to disturb the rest of the two drivers.
等到早上五点多两名司机醒来，陆伟才发现窗外已经覆满皑皑白雪。
When the two drivers woke up at more than five in the morning, Lu Wei found the window covered with snow.
陆伟和两名志愿者司机来自1100公里以外的湖北省广水市。
Lu Wei and two volunteer drivers came from Guangshui City, Hubei Province, 1,100 kilometers away.
根据随州市发布的截至2月4日24时的统计数据，随州市确诊病例706例，其中下属的广水市确诊病例178例，死亡两例。
According to the statistics released by Suizhou as of 2400 on February 4, 706 cases were diagnosed in Suizhou, 178 of which were confirmed in Guangshui city and two died.
辖区人口约95万人的广水市，只有两家纳入三级医院管理的二级医院，剩下的是乡镇卫生院。
Only two of the Canton Water City, with a population of about 950,000, are integrated into level II hospitals managed by level III hospitals, with the remainder being township hospitals.
疫情告急，广水市防疫工作的多项医疗防护物资也纷纷告急，陆伟告诉《中国经营报》记者，三人驰行千里是为了拿到天津正达捐赠的10吨84消毒液。
Lu told China Business Daily that the trio was speeding to get 10 tons of disinfectant 84 donated by Tianjin Zhengda.
往返于广水至天津的急行军天津正达是中海油天津化工研究设计院全资子公司、国家工业水处理工程技术研究中心产业化基地，以开发和生产工业水处理药剂、油田化学品、石油化工催化剂、汽车尾气催化净化产品、无机精细化学品为主。
Tianjin Zhengda is a wholly-owned subsidiary of CNOOC Tianjin Chemical Research and Design Institute and an industrial base of the State Industrial Water Treatment Engineering and Technology Research Center to develop and produce industrial water treatment agents, oilfield chemicals, petrochemical catalysts, automobile exhaust catalytic purification products and inorganic fine chemicals.
疫情爆发之后，天津正达停掉了所有的生产线，全力生产防疫工作的紧缺物资84消毒液，并无偿捐赠给湖北疫区使用。
After the outbreak of the outbreak, Tianjin Zhengda stopped all production lines, concentrate on the production of epidemic prevention supplies 84 disinfectant, and donated free of charge to Hubei epidemic areas for use.
“广水市青年企业家殷凯的姐姐就在中海油工作，正月初六（1月30日）了解到这条捐赠消息之后，就紧急和天津正达联系，核实双方信息。
"After learning of the donation on January 30, Yinkai's sister, a young entrepreneur in Guangzhou, contacted Tianjin Zhengda on an emergency basis to verify the information.
”陆伟回忆到，10吨84消毒液资源对广水来说不是小数目，广水市新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎防控指挥部（以下简称“指挥部”）分管领导知道之后非常重视，初七（1月31日）一天协调好所有的证明资料，并且由广水市邮政部门协调了一辆中通大货车和两位极有经验的志愿货车司机。
Lu recalled that 10 tons of disinfectant 84 was not a small amount for Guangshui, and that the Pneumonia Control Command (PCC) for the new coronavirus infection in Guangshui City paid close attention to it.
陆伟是初七晚上十点临时接到的任务，由他和两位65后的志愿者司机一同前往天津处理捐赠事宜。
Lu Wei was given a temporary assignment at 10 pm on the seventh day of junior high school. He went to Tianjin with two volunteer drivers after 65 to deal with the donation.
傍晚接到任务的陆伟意识到任务的重要性，第二天一早收拾了一套一次性洗漱用品，赶往指挥部拿到相关捐赠证明材料，汇合了两位司机便出发上路了。
Lu Wei, who was asked to do so in the evening, picked up a set of disposable toiletries early the next morning, rushed to the headquarters to get the donation documents, put the two drivers together and set off on his way.
从湖北省广水市出发，在高速上需穿越鄂豫、豫冀、津冀三个省级交界处才能抵达天津市。
Starting from Guangzhou City of Hubei Province, Tianjin can only be reached by crossing Hubei, Henan and Tianjin provinces at high speed.
“交警会主动过来给我们测量体温，问清我们是接受捐赠的车辆，查看相关证明之后，就让我们插队走了绿色快速通道。
"The traffic police would come and take our temperature, ask if we were the vehicles we were donating, check out the certificates, and cut in line for the green freeway.
”陆伟回忆着过省界时候的情形。
Lu Wei recalled crossing the provincial border.
大货车走不快，为了以最快的速度抵达天津并返回，除了加油等必须停车的情况，两位司机坚持人停车不停的原则在高速上疾驰。
In order to reach Tianjin and return as quickly as possible, the two drivers kept to the principle of stop-and-go and sped along at high speed, except when it was necessary to stop for refuelling.
三人泡面、吃面都是在疾驰行驶的驾驶室后座完成。
The trio's noodle and noodles are all done in the back seat of the racing cab.
耗时16个小时，陆伟一行三人抵达天津市西青区芦北口服务区。
It took 16 hours, Lu Wei and three people arrived in Tianjin West Qingkou service area.
“在路上住宾馆就要隔离14天，我们哪有那个时间。
"It's 14 days to stay in a hotel on the road. We don't have that time.
”陆伟把驾驶室后排可以睡觉的区域和车上的被子让给了两位司机，一个人在副驾驶座上守候了大半夜，“去的时候因为开了空调，车子里面还比较暖和。
Mr. Lu gave up sleeping quarters and quilts in the back of the cab to two drivers, one of whom waited in the driver's seat for much of the night.
大概过了一会儿，就感觉一个字——冷，脚冷、腿冷。
After a while or so, I felt a word -- cold, cold feet, cold legs.
为了不影响两位司机，我尽量保持一个姿势，后来就感觉浑身酸胀。
In order not to affect the two drivers, I tried to maintain one position, and later I felt sore all over.
”能装多少装多少只睡了四五个小时，2月1日凌晨五点，两个司机就起床了，摇下车窗外面已经被皑皑白雪覆盖。
The two drivers got up at five o'clock in the morning on February 1, and rolled down the window into the snow.
在服务区简单洗漱，陆伟三人匆匆赶到了天津正达。
In the service area simple gargle, Lu Wei-trio rushed to Tianjin Zhengda.
“他们八点半上班，我们担心去领捐赠物资的车辆太多，所以早点去排队。
"They went to work at 8: 30, and we were worried that there were too many vehicles to collect our supplies, so we lined up early.
”陆伟告诉记者，“中海油这边的捐赠手续特别简单，我们拿出捐赠协议证明真实性，他们的库管填好出库单就可以装货。
"The donation process here is particularly simple," Lu told reporters. "We showed the authenticity of the donation agreement, and their vaults were filled out and loaded.
一路绿灯。
A green light.
”据了解，双方原本协商的捐赠数量是10吨84消毒液，但中海油天津化工研究设计院院长听说陆伟一行从大老远的湖北赶来，就直接说：“能装多少装多少。
The amount of money the two sides had originally agreed to donate was 10 tons of disinfectant, but the dean of the Tianjin Institute of Chemical Research and Design heard that Lu Wei and his party had come all the way from Hubei Province.
”对于院长的慷慨，陆伟三人特别高兴，一箱一箱用钢筋保护好的消毒液被叉车送进货车车厢，原本准备装10吨的消毒液，最后整整装了18吨。
Lu was particularly pleased with the dean's generosity, packing boxes of steel-protected disinfectant into the wagons to hold 10 tons of disinfectant.
“我们希望能多带一些84消毒液回去，但装了18吨发现轮胎已经压扁了。
"We wanted to take some more disinfectant 84 with us, but we packed 18 tons and found the tires were flat.
车子虽然能跑，但可以看到前面的驾驶室离轮胎的距离只剩下2厘米。
Although the car could run, it could see that the front cab was only two centimetres from the tyre.
”陆伟三人商量了一下，为了安全起见，决定减少载重。
Lu Wei-trio discussed it, and decided to reduce the load for safety reasons.
在装货和卸货期间，两位驾驶技巧老道、经验丰厚的老司机一直在观察轮胎的变化，最后决定载着12吨84消毒液运回广水。
During loading and unloading, two experienced old drivers, skilled drivers, watched the tire change and finally decided to return to Guangzhou with 12 tons of disinfectant 84.
2月1日上午10点28分，陆伟一行返程。
At 10: 28 a.m. on Feb. 1, Lu Wei and his party returned.
因为载重增加，车速比来的时候更慢了，为了尽快回到广水，依然是人歇车不歇的赶路。
Because the load increases, the speed is slower than when the time came, in order to get back to Guangshui as soon as possible, is still closed the road.
95后的陆伟一直没有歇息，他除了要给司机导航，还需要和司机聊天解乏。
After 95 Lu Wei has not rested, he must not only give the driver navigation, but also need to chat with the driver.
直到2月2日凌晨四五点的时候，距离广水就100多公里的路程的时候，两位司机劝说两天两夜没有睡觉的陆伟到驾驶室后排去休息一下。
Until 4 or 5 a.m. on February 2, more than 100 kilometers from the open water, the two drivers persuaded Lu Wei, who had not slept for two days and nights, to take a rest in the back of the cab.
“最后两个小时我实在是顶不住了，他们也劝我说，‘不用担心，我们两个聊天，你睡会儿。
"I couldn't hold up for the last two hours, and they advised me, 'Don't worry, we'll talk and you'll sleep.
”陆伟说道。
"said Lu.
2月2日早上7点左右，陆伟一行安全回到广水市。
February 2 around 7 a.m., Lu Wei and his party safely back to the city of Guangzhou.
整个行程总耗时42个小时， 12吨84消毒液从天津安全运抵广水市指定仓库。
The journey took 42 hours and 12 tons of disinfectant 84 arrived safely from Tianjin to a designated warehouse in Guangzhou.
陆伟告诉记者：“按照捐赠方中海油的意愿，这批物资首先倾向于医院和基层，市区、大型的商城等地方在满足医院和基层需要之后再由市指挥部统一安排。
"In accordance with the wishes of donors CNOOC, this batch of materials tends to be hospitals and grass roots," Lu told reporters. "Urban areas, large malls and other places are unified by the city command after meeting the needs of hospitals and grassroots.
