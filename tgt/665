出村很困难，我决定步行口述/小李（物业保安班长）大年三十我最爱的姥姥去世了，要当天下葬。
It was difficult to leave the village, so I decided to walk oral / Xiao Li (Property Security Monitor) My favorite grandma died and was to be buried that day.
我匆匆请了假，从合肥坐高铁到老家，送姥姥一程。
I asked for leave hurriedly, from Hefei to take the high-speed train home, to send grandma a ride.
新闻我看得不多，不太清楚安徽到底多严重。
I don't see much news. I don't know how serious Anhui is.
但是公司对我们的要求一天比一天严格，每个人都能感到疫情确实很厉害。
But the company's demands on us are getting tougher every day, and everyone can feel that the epidemic is really serious.
比如我们有个责任制度，平常一年也出不了几个，现在发现员工不戴口罩，直接就是质量事故，要处罚通报。
For example, we have a responsibility system, usually a few a year, now found that staff do not wear masks, directly is a quality accident, to punish notification.
比如现在要求非业主不能进出，等等。
For example, now non-owners are required to access, and so on.
年初二我就想赶紧回来上班，特殊时期兄弟们人手紧缺，我不能掉队。
New Year's Day I would like to hurry back to work, special period brothers are short of hands, I can not lag behind.
可是，到处都封了。
But, uh, it's sealed everywhere.
我花了一个星期，天天去探路，发现封路的情况越来越严重。
I spent a week exploring the road every day and found that the road closures were getting worse.
初九，我决定走回去。
Ninth grade, I decided to walk back.
01大年三十回到家的时候，姥姥已经草草埋了家里人拦住我不让去坟头，说不能聚集，我哭了好几场。
By the time I got home by the end of the New Year, Grandma had hastily buried my family to stop me from going to the graveyard.
初二我准备回合肥。
I'm going back to Hefei.
请假时经理就让我快去快回，再一看工作群里，每天我们的工作量都在加，防疫任务重，大家进入了战备状态。
When the manager asked me to go back to work quickly, and then look at the work group, every day our workload is added, epidemic prevention task is heavy, everyone has entered a state of readiness.
我负责的部分都是兄弟们在承担，累坏他们了。
All I'm doing is taking on my brothers, and they're tired out.
初二吃完午饭，我爸踩三轮车送我去市集，我在公交站等了两个小时，想坐班车去市里乘高铁。
After lunch on the second day of junior high school, my father took me to the market by tricycle. I waited at the bus stop for two hours.
结果大家说，今天没车了，明天下午两点前有车。
It turned out that there was no car today. There would be a car by two tomorrow afternoon.
初三吃了早饭就去了，在外面搓手跺脚从九点半等到快十二点。
I went to breakfast on the third day of junior high and rubbed my hands outside and stomped my feet from half past nine till nearly twelve.
我看到了司机在买面条，他说走不掉了，路被封了。
I saw the driver buying noodles. He said he couldn't get it off. The road was blocked.
我不信，我回去开摩托车试，结果街上到处都是警灯在闪，不准开。
I don't believe it. I went back for a motorcycle test, and the street lights were flashing and forbidden.
初四我又去打听。
On the fourth day I asked again.
我弟踩着三轮车带着我到市集，一个超市老板说再踩半个小时到另外一个集镇去，那里还有班车。
My brother took me to the market on a tricycle, and a supermarket owner said he would walk half an hour to another market town, where there was a bus.
我们又去那里了，到了发现，路也封了，班车没有了。
We went there again, only to find that the road was closed and the bus was gone.
初五我爸不准我再出去了，说家里规矩是三六九往外走，其他时候不能走。
My father forbade me to go out any more. He said the rule was to go out by halves and threes, but not at any other time.
我就去地里打除草剂，这几天我快把十来亩地的除草剂都打完了。
I went to the field to shoot herbicides, these days I nearly finished dozen acres of herbicide.
初六看着兄弟们忙碌的信息，我心急如焚，因为我忽然不在，让他们变得更忙。
On the sixth day of the day, I watched the busy messages of my brothers. My heart was burning because I was suddenly away, making them busier.
年前，我跟兄弟们说了，大家都别抢着回家，过年了都想回家，我们一个个换着回，我保证回来一个走一个，我可以最后正月十五再回去过个元宵……我食言了。
Five years ago, I told my brothers, we do not rush home, after the New Year, we want to go home, one by one, I promise to go back one by one, I can last the fifteenth month back to a Lantern Festival... I reneged.
我爸骂我，别回了，老实在家待着，反正你就那么点工资，也没见你赚钱回来。
My father scolded me, don't go back, stay at home, anyway you just a little salary, you did not see you earn money back.
初八，我让妹夫开车来送我，他还没出村就被劝返了。
Junior 8, I let my brother-in-law drive me, he was not out of the village was persuaded back.
我决定走路到高铁站晚上我有了个主意，我跟兄弟们说：“我走回来，等着。
I decided to walk until the high-speed rail station. At night I had an idea. I said to my brothers, "I'll walk back and wait.
”他们都以为我开玩笑。
They thought I was joking.
初九大早，我爸去市集，家里的粮油店要开门。
In the early morning of the ninth day, my father went to the market.
爸说电动车也都不让走了，我让我弟骑摩托车最后再试试，还没到市集就被拦下。
Dad said the electric cars were not allowed to go either, so I asked my brother to try his motorcycle for the last time and was stopped before we got to the market.
已经9点了，我不能再拖，趁爸不在家，我要走了。
It's nine o'clock. I can't put it off. I'm leaving while Dad's not at home.
02天气还好，我拿上8个口罩，戴好手套、眼镜，兜里有手机和充电宝，出发。
02 The weather is good, I took eight masks, wear gloves, glasses, a mobile phone in my pocket and recharge Bao, set out.
我想走到高铁站，距离我家50多公里。
I want to get to the high-speed railway station, more than 50 kilometers away.
我们当保安的，有的是脚力，平时也经常一走3万多步。
We when the security guard, has the foot strength, also often walks the 30,000 steps frequently.
我先走到10来公里外的集镇，再打开手机导航。
I walked to the market town about 10 kilometers away and turned on my cell phone to navigate.
长这么大，第一次这么空的路，也第一次看到这么多条路都封了，简直是三步一岗，两步一卡。
Long so big, the first time such an empty road, but also the first time to see so many roads are closed, is simply three steps a post, two steps a card.
我见识到了各种路卡，有的是人力阻挡，有的直接是物理型的路障，超级长一辆货车把路挡着、土堆着，还有的两者都有。
I saw a variety of roadblocks, some manual, some of a physical nature, one super-long truck blocking the road, some piled up with dirt, some both.
路都被封起来了卡口处，人走路都不让走了。
The roads were sealed off and people were not allowed to walk.
我跟把守的解释，我是保安，战友都在前线，人手不够我要赶回去，劳烦放行。
The explanation I was guarding, I'm a security guard, my comrades are on the front line, I don't have enough men I need to get back. I'm tired of letting go.
我掏出身份证、工作牌，给他们递烟、拱手。
I took out my ID card, work card, offered them a cigarette, gave it away.
我说，你看我都走了这么远了，你们放心，我一路上都跟人保持距离，而且我绝对不回头不让你们为难。
I said, you see I have walked so far, you can rest assured that I have kept a distance, and I will never turn back not to embarrass you.
实在不放行的村庄，我就绕行，咱一双脚，怎么样都能走。
Really not to release the village, I detour, we can walk on both feet, how can go.
我已经决定了，我是不会回头的。
I've made up my mind. I'm not going back.
到处都是路障走了一会儿肚子就有些饿了，这几天早上都没吃多少。
There were roadblocks all over the place and after a while my stomach began to starve. I hadn't eaten much in the morning.
但是一路上都没有什么饭店，就算有，我也不敢去啊。
But there were no hotels along the way, and if they were, I wouldn't dare.
我到街边小店买了3瓶苏打水，累了就喝两口。
I went down the street and bought three bottles of soda water and drank two when I got tired.
我不敢停下来休息，这我有经验，走路的时候不能想着休息。
I dare not stop to rest, I have experience, when walking can not think of rest.
傍晚5点，到了高铁站。
At 5: 00 p.m., we arrived at the high-speed railway station.
走这50公里，我花了8个小时。
It took me eight hours to walk these 50 kilometers.
谢天谢地，高铁没封。
Thankfully, the high-speed rail is unsealed.
我赶紧买了半小时后出发的票。
I hastened to buy the tickets for the departure in half an hour.
兄弟们，我来了！我回到了工作岗位上下了高铁，我直奔我所在的门岗，晚上七点二十分。
Guys, I'm here! I'm back on the train at work. I'm going straight to my gate at 7: 20 p.m.
兄弟们很激动，给我全身上下喷了酒精，我说我来上班的，他们让我先去吃点东西，缓一缓，明天再上岗。
The brothers were so excited that they sprayed alcohol all over my body. I said I was coming to work, and they told me to go get something to eat, slow down and get on the job tomorrow.
我买了份盒饭，吃了一半，另一半早上热了吃。
I bought a boxed lunch, ate half of it, and the other half warmed up in the morning.
现在我每天上14个小时班，要保证门岗不出问题，保证小区秩序，业主纠纷有时候也要处理。
Now I work 14 hours a day, to ensure that the door does not go wrong, to ensure community order, owners disputes sometimes have to deal with.
我爸总说我只是个小保安，但是我不服，保安怎么了，只要好好干，终究是会得到社会的认可的。
My dad always said I was just a small security guard, but I disagree, security why, as long as you do well, will be recognized by the community.
