澎湃新闻记者 张无为3月2日晚，孙加强离开待了一个多月的印度尼西亚。
Zhang Wewei, a journalist, left Indonesia for more than a month on the evening of March 2.
在印尼，他的身份从一个游客转变成“百万口罩采购员”，他骑着摩托车穿过印尼的大街小巷，也从多起“口罩骗局”中抽身而出。
In Indonesia, his status changed from that of a tourist to that of a "one million mask buyer" who rode motorcycles through the streets of Indonesia and pulled himself out of a series of mask hoaxes.
而就在他离开的当天，印尼首次通报了该国2名新冠病毒感染病例。
On the day of his departure, Indonesia first reported two cases of the virus in the country.
此前，尽管东南亚多国都已出现确诊病例，但有2.6亿人口的印尼仍然表示该国无一例感染病例。
Earlier, Indonesia, home to 260 million people, said there were no new cases of infection in the country, despite confirmed cases in several countries in south-east Asia.
而据孙加强的观察，在全球疫情逐渐蔓延的这一个月，印尼戴口罩的人很少。
According to Sun's observations, Indonesia has seen few people wearing masks in the month of the global epidemic.
在印尼的一个多月中，孙加强前前后后一共购买了260箱口罩寄回国内。
For more than a month in Indonesia, Mr. Sun bought 260 boxes of masks and sent them back home.
在离开印尼前，孙加强接受了澎湃新闻专访，讲述了这段经历，他说，把这些故事写成剧本拍电影，会比《我不是药神》精彩得多。
Before leaving Indonesia, Sun told the story in a surging news interview, saying that turning the stories into screenplays and movies would be better than "I'm not a pharmacist."
孙加强朋友圈，朋友因其玩笑话P的一张图“我不是罩王” 本文均为受访者供图邮费比口罩还贵今年1月22日，在澳大利亚工作的孙加强和国内的亲朋好友相约去印尼的美娜多（Manado，又称万鸦老）旅游，本来他和亲友1月26日要各自返回澳大利亚和中国，因国内疫情发酵又耽误了两天。

28日，孙加强的亲友回国，但是他没有走成，一位国内的医生朋友告诉他，目前国内口罩紧缺，托他看看印尼“有没有口罩”。
On the 28th, Sun Jie's relatives and friends returned home, but he did not go, a domestic doctor friend told him that there is a shortage of face masks in the country, entrusting him to see whether Indonesia has "no masks."
“印尼那个时候的口罩还挺便宜的，不同的品牌，大概（人民币）3毛到5毛一个。
"At that time, the masks were quite cheap in Indonesia, with different brands, maybe between 30 cents and 51 cents.
”帮一个朋友买了，之后又陆续有别的朋友要口罩，孙加强就这样开始了“代购”之路。
"Help a friend to buy, and then have other friends want masks successively, Sun strengthened so began the" buying agent "road.
他每天早上6点起，骑着摩托车一家家药行跑，一天可以“搜罗”十几二十箱口罩。
Every morning at 6: 00 a.m., he runs around the house on his motorbike, and can "hunt" a dozen or so boxes of masks a day.
美娜多是印度尼西亚北苏拉威西省首府，是一个新兴的旅游城市，中国人不多，买口罩的人也不多。
Menado, the capital of Indonesia's North Sulawesi province, is a burgeoning tourist city with few Chinese and few people buying masks.
“一开始他们（药行的人）也很疑惑，这个东西放在那里，平时也没有人买，虽然有人戴口罩，但不是很多。
"At first they [the drug dealers] wondered, too, that it was there and no one usually bought it, although some wore masks, but not many.
”孙加强一开始买口罩非常顺利，有时候一家一家买，一次一两箱，有时候可以在药行提前预订十几二十箱，第二天去拿。
Sun initially bought masks very well, sometimes one at a time, one or two boxes at a time, and sometimes a dozen or twenty cases in advance at the drug store.
“他们的摩托车就跟滴滴一样，买完之后我就让一辆摩的把这些口罩送到邮局。
"Their motorcycles are dripping," he said. "After I buy them, I ask a motorcycle to take them to the post office.
一天下来买得差不多了，我再去邮局把这些口罩发往国内，一般10到15天可以寄到。
At the end of the day, I buy almost, I go to the post office to send these masks to the country, usually 10 to 15 days can be sent.
”一个口罩5角钱，一箱有2000个口罩，总价大概合人民币1000元，但是邮费却要人民币1500元，算下来一箱的口罩成本价2500元。
A 50-cent mask and 2,000 face masks in a case cost about 1,000 yuan, but the postage is 1,500 yuan, which translates to 2,500 yuan for a case of masks.
孙加强说，这些口罩在国内也一箱就卖2800到3000元，除去杂七杂八的费用，自己和朋友并不赚钱。
Sun said the masks sold for between 2,800 and 3,000 yuan a case in China. Apart from the miscellaneous expenses, he and his friends do not make money.
虽然邮费比口罩价格还贵，但邮寄却是把口罩寄回国内性价比最高的方式。
While postage is more expensive than a mask, mailing it is the most cost-effective way to send it back home.
据孙加强说，十几箱的邮费就要两三万元，相当于两个印尼人一年的工资。
According to Sun, more than a dozen cases cost 20,000 yuan, equivalent to two Indonesians a year's salary.
因为邮局只收现金，他要每天早起去取钱，再把大量现金交给邮局，就这样一直持续了四五天。
Since the post office only accepted cash, he got up early every day to get his money, and handed over a large amount of cash to the post office, which lasted four or five days.
在美娜多购买口罩辗转买到200箱口罩但是孙加强只有一个人，每天最多买20箱，除了采购还要负责将口罩邮寄到国内不同地方，从早忙到晚，效率并不高。
But Sun had only one person to buy up to 20 boxes a day and was responsible for sending masks to different parts of the country from morning to night, which was inefficient.
2月4日，孙加强向澎湃新闻发来信息，“从这几天收到的众多信息判断，国内情况不太乐观，可能会要长期作战。
"Judging from the information received over the past few days, the situation in China is not very optimistic, and we may have to fight for a long time," Sun said.
”孙加强表示，他准备继续留在印尼，“情况一直在变……每天一个人处理太多事情，已经超负荷。
Mr Sun said he was prepared to stay in Indonesia, "things have been changing... too much is being handled by one person each day, already overloaded."
”随着印尼的口罩越买越少，孙加强也在想其他的办法。
As the number of masks bought in Indonesia dwindled, Sun intensified and thought of other ways.
“那天挺巧的，我租的摩托车的老板说有需要可以找他，我就随口问了一句有没有口罩供应商，他说他的妹夫是口罩供应商，愿意给我提供口罩。
"It happened that day that the owner of the motorcycle I rented said I needed him, so I casually asked if I had a mask supplier. He said his brother-in-law was a mask supplier and would supply me with one.
”然而预订口罩需要预付人民币3万元的定金，如此大的数目也让孙加强考虑了很久，“我想了半天，还问了他很多问题，我也没见过他，最终我还是决定把定金付给他。
However, ordering the mask required a deposit of 30,000 yuan in advance, and Sun had to think about it for a long time. "I thought for a long time and asked him a lot of questions.
”还好，孙加强这次没有遇上骗子。
"Fortunately, Sun strengthened this time did not meet cheater.
2月5日，他来到了位于雅加达和美娜多中间的望加锡，和联系的口罩供应商见到了面，最终成功拿到了200箱口罩。
On February 5, he arrived in Makassar, between Jakarta and Menado, where he met with a supplier of masks and eventually managed to get 200 boxes of masks.
这让孙加强省了很多事，不用再一家家去搜集口罩。
This has saved Sun a lot of work from having to collect masks from one house to another.
彼时国内同等质量的口罩已经涨到了4、5块钱一个，而孙加强发回的口罩成本价是1.5元一个，找他要口罩的人也越来越多。
At that time, the national equivalent of the mask has increased to 4, 5 yuan a year, while Sun's cost is 1.5 yuan, and more and more people are looking for his mask.
但是随之而来的两条消息让孙加强再次陷入困境。
But the two messages that followed sent Sun into trouble again.
“邮局不再接受新的邮寄了。
"The post office no longer accepts new mailings.
”邮局的人告诉孙加强，不能再邮寄东西回中国了，但是据他推测，应该是邮局“爆仓”了，“因为不止我一个人在做（邮寄口罩回国）这件事。
The post office told Sun he could no longer send things back to China, but he speculated that it was the post office that was "popping" because I wasn't alone in doing it.
”另一条消息则是，2月2日印尼政府发布通知，2月5日12时开始暂停中国往返的所有航班。
In another development, the Indonesian government announced on February 2 that all flights to and from China would be suspended from 1200 hours on February 5.
寄回国的口罩赶在停航前将口罩运回国一下买到了200箱口罩，可是现在怎么寄回国，成了最现实的问题。
Return of the mask sent back to the country before the suspension to buy a 200-box mask, but how to send it back to the country has become the most realistic issue.
孙加强无奈在网上发了一条求助信息，这条信息又被很多人转发，许多媒体也刊登了孙加强的故事。
Sun Jian helplessness in the Internet issued a help message, this message was forwarded by many people, many media also published the story of Sun Jianjie.
“那天我回了一整个下午加一整个晚上的信息，一直不停有人给我提供如何把口罩寄回国内的信息，但是其中99%的信息都没用。
"I spent the whole afternoon and the whole evening getting information about how to send my mask back to my country, but 99 percent of that information was useless.
”经过孙加强筛选，最后只剩下两条渠道可以把口罩顺利寄到国内。
After Sun stepped up screening, there were only two channels left to send the masks to China.
一是孙加强的发小联系了一家公司，从他手上买了15万个口罩，在和东方航空协调后，赶上了最后一班从印尼到中国的飞机。
One is that Sun Jianghe contacted a company to buy 150,000 masks from him and, after coordinating with China Eastern, caught the last flight from Indonesia to China.
另一条渠道是一些在雅加达做物流的华人，他们同时也在帮助很多印尼华人将捐助的口罩运回国。
Another channel is for some Chinese doing logistics in Jakarta, who are also helping many Indonesian Chinese to bring back donated masks.
这些华人帮孙加强联系上宁波慈善总会，通过他们的捐赠通道，口罩可以顺利通过海关。
The Chinese helped Sun strengthen contacts with the Ningbo Charity Association, and through their donation channels, masks were able to pass through customs.
在邮局寄口罩 孙加强 图最终，这两个渠道都成功了。
Sending masks at the post office enhanced the map eventually, both of these channels succeeded.
200箱口罩顺利抵达中国，分散到相关各方手中，最后只留下10箱口罩可以让孙加强自由支配。
Two hundred cases of masks arrived in China and spread among the parties concerned, leaving only 10 cases of masks at Sun's disposal.
“7箱给了朋友，一箱捐给我的原单位海宁电视台，还有两箱捐给一个朋友的单位，他们管物业的，小区里非常非常缺口罩。
"Seven cases were given to my friend, a box to my former unit, Haining TV, and two cases to a friend's unit, who were in charge of the property, and there was a very, very small gap in the area.
”孙加强后来感慨，个人的力量是有限的，这几十万口罩中，一部分是他和朋友捐赠的，一部分是等价提供给单位和组织的。
"Sun later lamented that the strength of the individual was limited, and that some of the hundreds of thousands of masks were donated by him and his friends, while others were given to units and organizations at equal value.
对于有些说他是借捐赠的名义赚钱的说法，孙加强回应，“不可能几十万的口罩都是我出钱，拿去捐赠，这是超出我能力范围的。
"It's beyond my means to pay for hundreds of thousands of masks," Sun responded to those who said he was making money by donating them.
”至此，前前后后加起来，孙加强一共采购了约260箱口罩，而那个时候，印尼当地的口罩价格也开始疯涨，原价5角一个的口罩一度涨到了3元。
"So far, Sun has added up to about 260 cases of masks, while prices for Indonesia's local masks skyrocketed to as much as $3 for a 50-cent mask.
惊险的被骗经历此后，随着口罩价格的上涨，假借“口罩”赚钱的骗子也越来越多，孙加强也经历了一段“血泪史”。
Since then, as the price of masks rose, more and more fraudsters made money through masks, and Sun experienced a "history of blood and tears."
一次，有人曾对他说自己的女朋友是口罩厂厂长，有价值800万元的口罩，还给他发了口罩的视频。
On one occasion, he was told his girlfriend was the director of a mask factory, with a $8 million mask and a video of him being given a mask.
孙加强不是没有怀疑，但他的印尼朋友告诉他，这是一条“大鱼”。
Sun was not without doubt, but his Indonesian friend told him it was a "big fish."
在约好去仓库前，他请介绍人及“口罩长厂长”一起吃了韩国烧烤，花了600元人民币。
Before the date to go to the warehouse, he asked the referees and the "mask factory manager" to have a Korean barbecue, which cost 600 yuan.
晚上12点，一行人到达万隆，“口罩长厂长”却迟迟不带他去仓库，开着车到处转悠，说“警察一直在仓库周围巡逻，我们必须小心”。
At 12 p. m., when the party arrived in Bandung, the "mask factory director" took him late to the warehouse and drove around saying, "The police have been patrolling the warehouse. We have to be careful."
孙加强当时就很紧张，马上发定位给朋友，说“有事来救我”。
Sun Jiangheng was very nervous at that time, immediately on location to a friend, said "something to save me."
就这样虚晃了半小时，另一个人出现了，手里拿着一蛇皮口袋的口罩。
For half an hour another man appeared with a snake-skin pocket mask in his hand.
“这就是‘大鱼’？”孙加强脑袋嗡的一下，告诉他们自己太累了，先回房间。
"This is the 'big fish'?" Sun added, and told them that he was too tired to go back to his room first.
幸好，他并没有遇上人身危险，最终的损失只是一顿饭钱。
Fortunately, he was not personally at risk and the ultimate loss was a meal.
第二天早上，孙加强赶紧离开了万隆，返回雅加达。
The next morning, Sun intensified quickly left Bandung and returned to Jakarta.
在经过了各种被骗的故事后，孙加强也积累了许多经验，有时花人民币100多元让当地人跑腿去看口罩现货，有时在买口罩的群里直接怼骗子本人，将骗子揭穿。
After all the stories of being cheated, Sun also accumulated a lot of experience, sometimes spent more than 100 yuan to let the local people run errands to see the mask spot, sometimes in the purchase of a mask directly in the cheater himself, to expose the liar.
“因为利润太高了，有时候连他们自己都不相信，就到了我们互相害怕对方骗自己的程度。
"Because profits are so high that sometimes they don't believe it, it's to the extent that we're afraid of each other.
”“各种各样的骗子，我都不知道他们要骗什么。
"" All manner of swindlers, I don't know what they're trying to deceive.
”孙加强说。
"said Sun.
捐赠回国的口罩写着“中国加油”“借去的口罩以后会还的”随着中国国内的口罩产能也逐渐恢复，以及印尼当地口罩价格猛涨，孙加强买的口罩也越来越少了。
The face mask donated to China says, "Come on, China." With the recovery of mask production in China and surging prices for local masks in Indonesia, Sun is buying fewer masks.
在2月13日召开的国务院联防联控机制新闻发布会上，国家发改委相关负责人表示，自2月2日以来，我国口罩产量逐日提升，目前医用的非N95口罩的产能利用率达到了106%，有10个省份达到或超过了100%。
At a press conference on February 13, the head of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said that since February 2, production of non-N95 surgical masks has increased daily, with 106 percent of the production capacity of non-N95 surgical masks in use, and 10 provinces meeting or exceeding 100 percent.
另一方面，由于制作口罩中间过滤层的原料熔喷布成本也涨了20倍左右，口罩价格在印尼一直居高不下。
On the other hand, prices have been high in Indonesia because of a 20-fold increase in the cost of spraying materials used to make the mask's intermediate filter layer.
“已经没什么人采购了。
"There's not much shopping anymore.
”孙加强说，人民币2元多一个的口罩，对于印尼人来说还是有点贵。
Mr Sun said the two yuan yuan plus one mask was still a bit expensive for Indonesians.
在3月2日前，印尼一直未报告新冠肺炎感染病例，有一些人提出了质疑，认为印尼可能有一些未发现的病例，也有报道指出印尼目前进行的检测量很低、一些医院能力较弱。
Indonesia did not report new cases of pneumonia until March 2, with some questioning the possibility of undetected cases and reports of low levels of testing and weak hospital capacity.
针对这些质疑，印尼国内也不乏反驳之声。
In response to these doubts, there is plenty of rebuttal in Indonesia.
2月24日，孙加强收到了捐赠证明，他和朋友朱峥一共捐赠了7万个口罩，还有防护服、手套等各类防护用品。
On February 24, Sun received a donation certificate, and he and his friend Zhu Zheng donated 70,000 masks, along with protective clothing and gloves.
在印尼期间，他购买各类防护用品寄回国内，一共花费了20多万元。
During his stay in Indonesia, he spent more than 200,000 yuan buying various kinds of protective equipment and sending them back home.
在印尼的最后一段时间，结束口罩采购的孙加强又回到了美娜多学习潜水课程。
At the end of his stay in Indonesia, Sun, who had finished his mask purchase, returned to Menado to learn diving lessons.
“整个酒店就我一个客人，一对一教学。
"I'm the only guest in the hotel, teaching one-on-one.
”孙加强说，原本热闹的酒店现在根本没什么人，很多餐厅都关门了，只剩一两家还在营业。
Sun said the once bustling hotel was completely empty, with many restaurants closed and only one or two open.
3月2日，印尼总统佐科宣布，印尼本土确诊2名新冠病毒感染者，两人与此前从印尼旅游后回日本确诊的患者曾有过接触。
Indonesian President Joko announced on March 2 that two people infected with the virus had been confirmed in Indonesia, and that they had had contact with patients who had previously returned to Japan after traveling from Indonesia.
就在这一天，孙加强也启程离开了“奋战”一个多月的印尼，回到了澳大利亚。
On this day, Sun also left the "fight" more than a month from Indonesia, back to Australia.
“印尼旅游变成了深度游，我以后应该经常会去。
"Indonesia has become a deep tourist destination and I should go there often.
”回望这次一个多月的印尼之行，孙加强感慨道，“感谢印尼，我们借去的口罩，以后会还的。
Looking back on his visit to Indonesia for more than a month, Sun lamented, "Thanks to Indonesia, we have borrowed masks that will be returned later.
”临走前，孙加强请印尼朋友吃饭本期编辑 邢潭推荐阅读。
