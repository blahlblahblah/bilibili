深度和角度——这就是我们能做的。
Depth and angle - that's what we can do.

这只不过说明不是美国人慌了，更多是疫情的散布和加剧切切实实就在身边。
This simply means that Americans are not panicking, but rather that the spread and intensification of the epidemic is well within reach.
文 | 马纶鹏战疫下半场，各国出奇招。
Ren of China's second half of the epidemic, countries unusual move.
英国近似无情的冷静下的“全民免疫”，中东很多国家直接关闭国境，而美国人民的日常生活似乎并没有封城的恐惧，也没有口罩印记的烦恼。
With Britain's almost callous "universal immunization," many countries in the Middle East have closed their borders directly, and the daily lives of the American people do not seem to be marked by fear of closure or by the stamp of a mask.
但是每天攀升的案例和死亡数字增加，以及特朗普一贯的大嘴和临时措施，已经让接收欧洲回美的机场不堪重负，估计还有一波疫情。
But the daily rise in the number of cases and deaths, together with Trump's usual outpouring of rhetoric and temporary measures, has overburdened airports receiving Europe back to the US, with an estimated further wave of outbreaks.
美国约翰斯·霍普金斯大学发布的实时统计数据显示，截至北京时间3月16日，美国新冠肺炎确诊病例已达3499例。
According to real-time statistics released by Johns Hopkins University in the United States, 3,399 cases of pneumonia had been confirmed by March 16, Beijing time.
现在是暗流涌动，美国人民不傻，第一件事就是囤货。
Now is the undercurrent, the American people are not stupid, the first thing is hoarding goods.
新闻报道已经很多，从卫生纸到速冻食品，从枪支弹药到汽油储备。
News reports have ranged from toilet paper to frozen foods, from guns and ammunition to gasoline reserves.
但很多都是片面和虚夸的情绪，说的好听一些是同是天涯沦落人，不好听就是幸灾乐祸的狭隘。
But many are one-sided and boastful emotions, said some are the end of the earth, is not easy to hear is to gloat narrow.
所以我用三个美国大超市/药店的多张图片告诉大家“美国售罄”的基本面，管中窥豹的交谈可以让读者们领略普通人是怎么面对和想象这个“末世感”。
So I used several pictures from three of America's biggest supermarkets / pharmacies to tell you about the fundamentals of "sold-out America," and the conversation gave readers a glimpse of how ordinary people face and imagine this "end-of-life feeling."
调查的两个连锁大超市是Food Lion和Kroger，比较美国化，属于美东海岸中南部工薪阶级常去的。
The two major supermarket chains surveyed, Food Lion and Kroger, are more Americanized and frequently visited by working-class workers on the east and south east coast.
Walmart 和Costco 暂时没去，因为他们已经国际化，下周可以去逛逛。
Walmart and Costco are temporarily absent because they are internationalized and can visit next week.
另外一个是美国最大的CVS连锁药店，说是说药店，相当于我们的大型便利店，吃喝用度基本都有。
The other is the largest CVS pharmacy chain in the United States, which says drugstores are the equivalent of our large convenience stores and have a basic amount of food and drink.
用中国的标准衡量，在大型超市和小卖部之间的体量和规格。
Volume and specification by Chinese standards between large supermarkets and commissaries.
美国人都喜欢一大包一大包地买，量贩十足。
Americans love to buy big bags full of peddlers.
上周末各个货架都是满的，这个周末我看到了从未见过的“空架感”，冰火两重天。
Shelves were full last weekend, and this weekend I saw a "sense of emptiness" I had never seen before.
当然不是空空如也，很多物资还是充足的。
Of course not empty, a lot of material is still sufficient.
这只不过说明不是美国人慌了，更多是疫情的散布和加剧切切实实就在身边。
This simply means that Americans are not panicking, but rather that the spread and intensification of the epidemic is well within reach.
民以食为天1. 大米平时几乎无人问津，毕竟不是美国人的主食。
Rice is seldom eaten in normal times. After all, it is not the staple food of Americans.
如今可是硬货……2. 牛奶来过美国的都说这里奶制品又好又纯，可是三个店里几乎都卖光了。
Now, hard wares... 2.Milk has been to the United States to say that the dairy products here are good and pure, but almost all three are sold out.
第一张玻璃反射中的嘻哈壮汉跟我说，这他妈是怎么回事？我说，也许下周就会到的。
The first of these glassy reflections tells me what the fuck is going on? I said maybe next week.
他瞥了我一眼。
He glanced at me.
3. 瓶装水重要性不言而喻。
The importance of bottled water is self-evident.
虽然美国人有喝tap water(直饮水)的习惯，但也挡不住焦虑。
Although Americans have a habit of drinking tap water, they can't stop worrying.
4. 面包这对美国普通人很是关键，只是如今他们要望架兴叹了，连面粉都没了……5. 牛肉、鸡肉美国人吃得最多的肉类。
Bread is the key to the average American, but now they want to fight and sigh and lose all the flour... Beef, chicken Americans eat the most meat.
货还是有的，但特价的都被抢光了。
The goods are still available, but the special ones have been looted.
6. 你想不到的披萨对，因为简单、方便和美味，冷冻披萨向来是餐桌常菜。
6.You can't imagine pizza Yes, frozen pizza is always on the table because it's simple, convenient and tasty.
7. 其他依次是意面、方便面、薯片、豆子、饮料、鸡蛋、果汁、爆米花、百吉圈……生活用品和医疗用品口罩就想都不用想了，早在一月底就没货。
7. Other items are spaghetti, instant noodles, potato chips, beans, drinks, eggs, juice, popcorn, bagels... and medical supplies and masks. They were out of stock at the end of January.
当然，买了，你也看不到有人戴。
Of course, you can't see anyone wearing it.
网上都是卫生纸疯抢的图片上了热搜。
On the net is the picture that toilet paper crazily snatches on the hot search.
是，这里三个超市都卖光了，所以中国的进出口商们有机会了。
Yes, all three of the supermarkets are sold out here, so Chinese importers and exporters have a chance.
而个人防护的洗手液、消毒液什么的，自然也没有了。
And personal protection of hand sanitizer, disinfectant and so on, of course no longer.
1. 卫生纸巍巍壮观，因为片甲不留。
1. Toilet paper is majestic because it is not retained.
2. 各种洗手液、清洁剂、消毒剂仿佛买了回去，就百病不侵？还有袋装的冰块，一次性手套，防止胃酸的消化药也基本见底了。
2. All kinds of hand sanitizers, detergents and disinfectants seem to be bought back, and there are bags of ice, disposable gloves, digestive medicine to prevent stomach acid also basically see the bottom.
是不是真的是要“深挖仓广积粮”？当然，赫赫有名的科罗拉啤酒(Corona)还是有的，它沾了新冠的福。
Is it really about digging deep into the granary? Of course, there is the celebrated Corona, which is blessed with a new crown.
看着这么神奇的画面，我就问在努力补货的货架员：“都卖光了？” “是啊，没办法。
Looking at this amazing picture, I asked the shelf-man who was trying to replenish his wares: "All sold out?" "Yes, there's nothing we can do.
”“什么时候的事？”“也就这两天。
"" When did it happen? "" Just these two days.
”“能不能补货呢？”“我们的供应商明天就会来了。
"Can we get the goods back?" "Our supplier will be here tomorrow.
只是，补多少，我们也不知道。
It's just, how much, we don't know.
”再问收银员：“这几天你们很忙啊！”“是的，大家都来买东西。
Ask the cashier again, "You've been busy these days!" "Yes, everyone has come to do the shopping.
”“大家是不是都有些害怕？”“恐怕是的，谁知道呢。
"Are we all afraid ？" "I'm afraid so ， who knows ．"
”在空空的面包货架。
"On empty bread shelves.
一位美国大妈喃喃自语，都没有了，这是疯了吗？我之前碰到的嘻哈壮汉后来跟我说，世界末日也不过如此。
Is it crazy for an American granny to mutter to herself that it's gone? I met a hip-hop guy who later told me that the end of the world was over.
我说，也不完全吧，还是有很多货的，很快就会补进。
I said, also is not complete, still have a lot of goods, will soon make up.
他看了我一眼，没说话，也许他要买的东西都没买全。
He looked at me and didn't say anything. Maybe he didn't buy everything he wanted.
在Kroger恰巧遇见从阿根廷来美国做西班牙语助教的女生，之前见过。
At Kroger, I happened to meet a girl who came from Argentina to work as an assistant teacher in Spanish.
她说学校的课程全部取消，变成网上授课，忽如其来的变化。
She said the school curriculum had been canceled and turned into online classes, as it had changed.
自己还不知道要不要回布宜诺斯艾利斯，但是那里的确诊数字也在上升，她觉得美国相对还是安全的。
She did not know whether to go back to Buenos Aires, but the number of confirmed cases was rising, and she felt that the United States was relatively safe.
她又转过头，跟我说，我们应该学习中国，现在中国都好了。
She turned to me and said that we should learn from China, which is fine now.
我冲她点点头。
I nodded to her.
