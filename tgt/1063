澎湃新闻记者 伍银芳 蔡琳 吕妍最近几天，武汉一些学校宿舍被征用的相关信息引起网友热议。
Wu Yinfang Cai Lin Lu, a journalist in Pai Pai, has been the subject of a heated discussion among netizens in recent days.
而这一热议的背后，都源于武汉市新冠肺炎疫情防控指挥部征用学校宿舍。
And behind this heated discussion, are from Wuhan City Xinguan Pneumonia Command requisitioned school dormitories.
随着武汉的新冠肺炎患者确诊数量越来越多，定点医院和已投入使用的三所方舱医院的床位已经不够用，所以，另外12所“方舱医院”已经陆续在建，学校宿舍也被征用。
With the increasing number of confirmed cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, the number of beds in designated hospitals and the three already in use in the three square-cabin hospitals has been insufficient, so that another 12 "square-cabin hospitals" have been under construction and school dormitories have been requisitioned.
根据武汉市新型肺炎防控指挥部医疗救治组在2月5日发布的《关于进一步规范新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎定点收治医院患者收治工作的通知》和媒体公开报道，目前我们得知，目前收治病人呈几个梯度：定点医院主要用于收治重症、危重和疑似危重病例；方舱医院主要用于收治轻症患者；而被征用的学校宿舍，则部分作为医疗点收治轻症患者；另外一部分作为隔离点，接收密切接触者和疑似患者。
According to the Notice on Further Regulating Admission of Patients with Coronavirus Infection in Pneumonia Targeted Hospital and the media report issued on February 5 by the Medical Treatment Team of Wuhan New Coronavirus Infection, we have learned that there are several gradients.
十多所学校宿舍被征用，改造出11455张床位2月7日，湖北省召开第17场新冠肺炎疫情防控工作新闻发布会上，武汉市委常委、常务副市长胡亚波透露，将省委党校的新校区和武汉市属4所高校（江汉大学、武汉商学院、武汉软件工程职业学院、武汉城市职业学院）改造为定点医疗点，用于收治已经确诊的轻症患者。
Wuhan Municipal Party School, Wuhan Business School, Wuhan Software Engineering Vocational College and Wuhan City Vocational College) were transformed into designated medical stations to treat patients with confirmed mild cases at the 17th press conference of Hubei Province on Feb. 7 to prevent and control the outbreak of new crown pneumonia.
另外，据《楚天都市报》报道，武汉市教育局直属的6所中职学校以及其他几所职业学校，还有省委党校老校区作为疫情防控集中隔离场所。
In addition, six secondary vocational schools under the Wuhan Municipal Education Bureau and several other vocational schools, as well as the old school district of the provincial Party School, serve as a centralized quarantine site for epidemic prevention and control, according to the Chu Tian Metropolis Daily.
十多所学校共改造出床位约11455张，其中定点医疗点约6900张，集中隔离点约4555张。
About 11455 beds have been converted from more than 10 schools, including 6,900 designated medical centers and 4,555 centralized ones.
学校宿舍要成为隔离点和医疗点，仍然需要一些必备物资和特殊改造，并根据“一校一策”原则制定方案。
School dormitories are still in need of essential supplies and special adaptations to be used as isolation points and medical points, and are designed in accordance with the "one school, one policy" principle.
有些学校给每个床位配备了相应物资。
Some schools have supplied each bed with appropriate materials.
以武汉城市职业学院为例，每间房间均有独立卫生间、空调等设施，免费提供床上用品六件套，生活日用品13样(14件)：水桶1个，面盆1个，开水瓶1个，牙膏1只，牙刷1个，洗漱杯1个，卫生卷纸1筒，垃圾篓1个，垃圾袋1卷，洗手液1瓶，拖鞋（布）1双，拖鞋（凉）1双，毛巾2条。
Wuhan City Vocational College as an example, each room has independent toilet, air conditioning and other facilities, free of charge to provide 6 sets of bedding, 13 items (14 items): 1 bucket, 1 basin, 1 flask, 1 toothpaste, 1 toothbrush, 1 toilet paper, 1 waste basket, 1 garbage bag, 1 bottle of hand sanitizer, 1 pair of slippers (cold), 2 towels.
据此前新京报网报道，武汉商学院的寝室要进行改造。
According to the former Beijing News Network, Wuhan Business School dormitory to be reformed.
除了要增加一条380V的高电压供医疗器械使用，还要改造卫生间与化粪池连接的管道系统，以保证被隔离人群的排泄物经过消毒后排出。
In addition to the addition of a 380-V high voltage for medical devices, the system of piping the toilet to the septic tank needs to be modified to ensure that the excreta of the isolated population are sterilized and discharged.
更重要的是，由于学生的床是“上床下柜”结构，所以要把床体4条腿“锯下来”，方便患者上下。
More importantly, as the student's bed is "under the bed" structure, to "saw off" the bed four legs, to facilitate the patient up and down.
学校的一系列处理措施考虑周到，但是“锯床”的动作是否在未来会给学生带来一些问题，希望校方能够考虑到，并合理处置。
The school's treatment was well thought out, but whether the sawing process would cause problems for students in the future, I hope that the school can take it into account and deal with it properly.
15所“方舱医院”提供上万张床位除了已经建成（2月3日）并投入使用的洪山体育馆（800张床位）、武汉客厅（2000张床位）、武汉国际会展中心（1600张床位）三所方舱医院之外，2月4日起，又有12所在陆续建设中。
Fifteen "square-cabin hospitals" have provided tens of thousands of beds. Apart from the Hongshan Stadium (800 beds), Wuhan living room (2,000 beds) and Wuhan International Exhibition Center (1,600 beds), which have been completed and put into operation since February 3, 12 more are under construction since February 4.
届时15所“方舱医院”将可以提供11600张床位（这个数字不包含两所未公布数据的“方舱医院”）。
The 15 "square-cabin hospitals" will be able to provide 11,600 beds (the number does not include the two "square-cabin hospitals" for which unpublished data are available).
“方舱医院”主要用于收治已确诊轻症患者。
"Square cabin hospital" is mainly used to treat patients with confirmed mild cases.
35所“定点医院”万余张床位是抗疫最前线根据武汉市卫健委官网自2月1日起发布的“全市定点医院病床使用情况”数据显示，定点医院及其床位数量一直在增加。
More than 35 "designated hospitals" with more than 10,000 beds are the frontline of the epidemic. According to the figures on the use of hospital beds in designated hospitals throughout the city issued by Wuhan Health Officers' Network on February 1, the number of designated hospitals and their number has been increasing.
截至2月10日，武汉市已经开放35家定点医院，开放床位12437个，其中，雷神山和火神山分别开放床位803张、88张。
As of February 10, Wuhan city had opened 35 designated hospitals, with 12,437 beds, of which 803 and 88 were open in Raytheon Mountain and Mount Fire respectively.
而根据此前报道，雷神山和火神山医院共编设床位2500张。
According to previous reports, Lui Shenshan and Mount Fujimori Hospital have a total of 2,500 beds.
所以，加上还未开放的“两神山”床位，这35家定点医院总共可以提供床位14046张，主要用于收治重症、危重和疑似危重病例。
So, with the unopened "two Shenshan" beds, the 35 designated hospitals can provide a total of 14,046 beds, mainly for the treatment of serious, critical and suspected critical cases.
根据以上公开数据整理，我们得知，待所有改造完成，包括定点医院、方舱医院和已被征用的学校宿舍在内，武汉市的床位数将有37101个左右，其中，约有32546个床位用于收治已经确诊的患者。
Based on the above public figures, we have learned that when all the renovation is completed, including designated hospitals, square-cabin hospitals and requisitioned school dormitories, the number of beds in Wuhan will be 37,101, of which about 32,546 will be used for patients who have been diagnosed.
除了省党校老校区和已经公布的十几所职业学校外，还有酒店和社区等隔离点，但因为相关公开数据不多，所以没有放在此次统计之列。
In addition to the old school district of the provincial Party School and the dozens of vocational schools that have been published, there are also isolated points such as hotels and communities, which are not included in the statistics because of the limited number of publicly available data.
