对SARS毫无印象的我，倒不太担心此次新冠肺炎疫情……我更希望的是这场肺炎疫情能够赶快结束，倒不是因为每天在家的诸多不便，而是我担心这样下去会影响到中国乃至世界经济。
I'm not too worried about SARS... I'd rather see the pneumonia end soon, not because of the inconvenience of being at home every day, but because I fear it will affect China and the world economy.
口述 |Philippe Régnier整理 | 金　姬我从没想到过，自己会离开法国在上海成家立业。
Philippe Régnier I never expected to leave France to start a family and career in Shanghai.
更没想到的是，第一次请父母中国行，就遇到了新冠疫情大爆发……先自我介绍一下，我叫菲利普（Philippe），今年46岁，出生于法国东南部沃克吕兹省（Vaucluse）的城市奥朗日（Orange），儿时在法国南部与西班牙交界的佩皮尼昂（Perpignan）度过。
What's more, the first time I asked my parents to travel to China, I encountered a major outbreak of the New Crown... First, I introduced myself as Philippe, 46, born in the city of Orange, in the south-eastern French province of Vaucluse, and spent my childhood in Perpignan, on France's southern border with Spain.
在历史上，佩皮尼昂曾一度属于西班牙，所以现在那里还是加泰罗尼亚文化圈的重要城市之一。
Historically, Perpignon once belonged to Spain, so it is now one of the great cities of Catalan culture.
与西班牙交界的法国南部小城佩皮尼昂可能是从小在文化融合的地方长大，让我能在各种环境下都觉得很适应。
The southern French town of Perpignon, near the border with Spain, may have been brought up in a place of cultural fusion, allowing me to feel comfortable in a variety of settings.
我在巴黎完成大学课程后留在那里工作，成为一名软件工程师，后来又去了法国西南部的图卢兹工作。
After completing my university course in Paris, I stayed there to work as a software engineer and later in Toulouse, in south-west France.
相信很多中国人都听说过图卢兹，那里不仅是一座商贸、旅游之城，还有仅次于巴黎的法国第二大规模的大学城，空客总部也在那里。
I believe many Chinese have heard of Toulouse, which is not only a city of commerce and tourism, but also the second largest university town in France after Paris, with Airbus headquarters.
36岁时，我进入Intel（英特尔）在图卢兹的研发中心工作，有时也会和中国研发中心的同事一起合作，我们的工作语言是英语，所以并没有感到明显的国别之分。
At the age of 36, I joined Intel's research and development center in Toulouse and occasionally worked with colleagues at the China Research and Development Center.
2016年年中，英特尔计划在一年内陆续关闭在法国的5家研发中心，图卢兹就是其中之一。
Toulouse is one of five research and development centers in France that Intel plans to close in mid-2016.
当时我有两种选择——雷诺并购英特尔位于图卢兹研发汽车嵌入式软件的团队，我可以转到雷诺公司工作；或是转到英特尔在中国上海的研发中心。
I had two options at the time - Renault's acquisition of Intel's team in Toulouse to develop embedded car software, and I could move to Renault or Intel's research and development centre in Shanghai, China.
我毫不犹豫选择了后者。
I did not hesitate to choose the latter.
我此前从未在其他国家长期工作过，但我到中国出差过几次，去过惠州、宁波和珠海。
I have never worked in other countries for a long time, but I have been to China several times and have been to Huizhou, Ningbo and Zhuhai.
这些并非中国的一线城市，短暂的逗留足以让我喜欢上这个国家。
These are not the first cities in China, and a brief stay is enough to make me like the country.
2017年3月至今，我一直就在上海闵行紫竹的英特尔亚太研发中心工作。
Since March 2017, I have been working at Intel Asia-Pacific Research and Development Center in Minhang, Shanghai.
三年来，我在上海工作生活都很顺利，直到今年1月……父母第一次的亚洲行，恰逢新冠肺炎疫情大爆发在上海这三年，我每年都选择夏天休年假回法国。
For three years, I worked and lived well in Shanghai until January, when my parents' first trip to Asia coincided with the outbreak of pneumonia in Shanghai.
一方面，虽然佩皮尼昂是一个四季宜人的城市，但我们喜欢在夏天全家人一起外出度假；另一方面，我一到上海就认识了现在的妻子——一位美丽善良的台湾姑娘，我更希望圣诞节+中国传统春节的日子和她在一起。
On the one hand, although Peppinion is a pleasant city with four seasons, we like to go on holiday together in summer. On the other hand, I got to know my wife, a beautiful and kind Taiwanese girl, as soon as I arrived in Shanghai.
去年，我们正式结婚了。
Last year, we were officially married.
我太太姓黄，所以我现在也有了一个中文名“黄文菲”。
My wife's surname is Huang, so I now have a Chinese name "Huang Wenfei."
我也会简单的中文交流，可以用拼音网聊。
I can also communicate in simple Chinese. I can talk with Pinyin.
不过平时，我主要还是说英文（现在公司会法语的同事很少）。
Usually, however, I still speak mostly English (there are very few French-speaking colleagues in the company today).
在上海这座国际化都市，我并没有感到有什么不方便。
I don't find it inconvenient to be in Shanghai, a cosmopolitan city.
今年春节，我父母第一次来中国看望我们，顺道游览一下这个东方大国。
My parents came to visit us in China for the first time this Spring Festival.
虽然要从巴黎转机（中国没有直飞佩皮尼昂的航班），坐十几个小时的飞机才能来中国，但是他们对于首次亚洲行满怀期待。
Although the flight from Paris (China has no direct flight to Pepi Niang) will take more than a decade to get to China, they are looking forward to their first trip to Asia.
我父母是1月17日到中国的，当时我们全家都没有在意新冠肺炎。
My parents arrived in China on January 17 and neither of us cared about pneumonia at the time.
2003年SARS（法语缩写是SRAS）爆发时，我正在巴黎工作，几乎对于这个疫情没有什么印象，可能是因为当时法国只有7人感染的缘故。
When the SARS outbreak broke out in 2003, I was working in Paris and had little impression of the epidemic, probably because only seven people were infected in France.
所以这一次，我一开始也只是看看网上有关新冠肺炎的科普内容而已，完全没有想到它会发展如此迅速，对于中国的影响如此巨大。
So this time, I started by looking at the popular science content of Newcastle Pneumonia, completely unprepared for its rapid growth and impact on China.
我先陪父母去了北京旅游，考虑到那里的雾霾天气，所以大家都戴了口罩，没想到这一举措在后来看来是多么明智。
I accompanied my parents to Beijing to travel, considering the fog there, so everyone wearing masks, did not expect that this move in the future seems to be how wise.
我记得很清楚，周围的中国人也开始都戴口罩是在1月21日，因为前一晚在武汉的钟南山宣布此次新冠肺炎“人传人”，所以一夜之间满大街都是戴口罩的中国人。
I remember clearly that the Chinese people around me started wearing masks on January 21, because the night before the announcement of the "human-to-human" pneumonia in Zhong Nan Shan in Wuhan, the night before, the streets were filled with Chinese wearing masks.
法国IT男黄文菲（中）陪第一次来中国的母亲在北京坐地铁图 | 黄文菲我父母和我一样，对于17年前的SARS也没啥记忆。
French IT man Huang Wenfei (middle) with his first-time Chinese mother at a subway station in Beijing. My parents, like me, have little recollection of SARS 17 years ago.
我们对于此次新冠肺炎疫情，一开始也没太在意。
We did not pay much attention to the outbreak of new crown pneumonia at first.
哪怕媒体报道有武汉女游客吃退烧药去法国，法国民众对此反应也并不强烈，我发现反而中国网民更加义愤填膺。
Even if the media reported that Wuhan women tourists to France to eat antipyretics, the reaction of the French public was not strong, I found instead Chinese Internet users more indignant.
虽然欧洲确诊的首例新冠肺炎病例就在法国，但直到今天，法国病例只有12例，主要是去法国的游客，还有一名接触过来自中国新冠肺炎病人的法国医生。
Although the first confirmed case of pneumonia in Europe was in France, to this day there are only 12 cases in France, mainly tourists to France and a French doctor who has come into contact with patients from China's Newcastle Pneumonia.
这可能和法国很早就对疫情采取管控措施有关。
This may be related to the early control of the epidemic in France.
巴黎街头，亚洲人戴口罩居多妻子倒是我家最紧张的一个，这可能是因为她对2003年SARS记忆犹新。
In the streets of Paris, the fact that Asians wear more masks than any other wife is one of the most stressful in my family, probably because she has fresh memories of SARS in 2003.
当时，台湾有600多人感染，一些医护人员也因此殉职。
At the time, more than 600 people in Taiwan were infected and some medical personnel died in the line of duty.
这次疫情一爆发，我太太就定期和台湾家人沟通，她也很关注有关新冠肺炎疫情的新闻。
As soon as this outbreak broke out, my wife communicated regularly with her family in Taiwan. She was also very concerned about the news about the outbreak of pneumonia in Taiwan.
台湾在1月21日宣布了首例确诊新冠肺炎病例，目前累计22例，死亡1例。
Taiwan announced its first confirmed case of new crown pneumonia on January 21, with a cumulative total of 22 cases and one death.
我们1月23日从北京回到上海，当天武汉封城，上海似乎也没了春节的热闹。
We returned to Shanghai from Beijing on January 23, when Wuhan Seung-cheng, Shanghai also seemed to lose the excitement of the Spring Festival.
对于我来说，最不方便的就是不能带第一次来上海的父母在外享受本地美食（我们法国人也很喜欢上海美食），外卖也纷纷停了，我们不得不去超市采购一些食材，尽量在家解决一日三餐。
The most inconvenient thing for me was not to take my parents to Shanghai for the first time to enjoy local cuisine (we French like Shanghai food too) and to stop taking out, so we had to go to the supermarket and try to make three meals a day at home.
还好，善解人意的父母兴致还不错，我们抽空就带他们去上海各处逛逛。
Luckily, the understanding parents were in good spirits and we took them around Shanghai when we found time.
外出期间，我们很当心，只有拍照时才摘下口罩。
We are very careful not to take off our masks until we take pictures.
今年春节期间，黄文菲（左一）和台湾妻子带法国父母逛上海外滩 图 | 黄文菲我父母是2月9日从浦东机场坐飞机回法国的。
During the Spring Festival, Huang Wenfei (first from the left) and his wife took their French parents to Shanghai Bund. My parents flew back to France from Pudong Airport on February 9.
2月9日晚，黄文菲（中）在上海浦东机场送父母图 | 黄文菲按照法国卫生部公布的最新防疫通知，要求来自高风险区域者抵达法国后自行隔离14天，按时测量体温等。
Huang Wenfei, who gave his parents a ride at Shanghai's Pudong airport on the evening of February 9, asked people from high-risk areas to isolate themselves for 14 days after arriving in France to take regular temperature tests, according to the latest vaccination notice issued by the French Ministry of Health.
我父母到达巴黎戴高乐机场时，只是被测了体温，一切都OK，他们现在回到图卢兹的家中自行隔离。
When my parents arrived at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, they had their temperature taken and everything was OK.
有了在上海的防控经验，我觉得他们在家应该能应付自如吧。
With their control experience in Shanghai, I think they should be able to handle it well at home.
在家复工，期待疫情早日结束英特尔很久以前就允许员工有条件地在家工作，所以这次复工后，大多数人在家工作都OK。
Resume work at home, expect an early end to the epidemic Intel long ago allowed its employees to work conditionally at home, so after returning to work, most people work from home OK.
只不过有些人需要回办公室取一下工作电脑而已。
It's just that some people need to go back to the office to get a working computer.
据我所知，去办公室工作的人，公司会发口罩，食堂吃饭也被要求每个人距离一米就餐。
As far as I know, people who go to work in the office will be given masks and the canteen will be asked to eat at a distance of one metre.
我租住在离公司不远的小区，之前去居委会预约登记，又买了5个口罩。
I rented in a small area not far from the company, before the neighborhood committee to make an appointment to register, and bought five more masks.
加上之前雾霾天囤的N95口罩，在保持清洁的情况下重复使用，目前我的口罩是够用的。
Add the previous fog hoard days of the N95 mask, in a clean condition under repeated use, my current mask is sufficient.
我倒不太担心此次新冠肺炎疫情，我已经密切关注相关新闻近一个月，疫情发展没有之前那么迅猛了。
I'm not worried about the new outbreak of pneumonia. I've been watching the news for almost a month.
2月14日，80岁的湖北新冠肺炎游客在法国去世，这是亚洲以外地区出现的第一例新冠肺炎死亡病例。
The 80-year-old Hubei New Crown Pneumonia tourist died in France on Feb. 14, the first death from pneumonia outside Asia.
我相信法国的新冠肺炎疫情还是可防可控的。
I believe that the outbreak of canopy pneumonia in France is preventable.
我更希望的是这场肺炎疫情能够赶快结束，倒不是因为每天在家的诸多不便，而是我担心这样下去会影响到中国乃至世界经济。
What I hope is that the pneumonia epidemic will end soon, not because of the inconvenience of being at home every day, but because I fear that it will affect China and the world economy.
2月13日，法国财政和经济部长勒梅尔（Bruno Le Maire）表示，新冠肺炎疫情将导致2020年法国经济增速减少0.1个百分点，2020年全球经济增长将降低0.2个百分点……毕竟中国经济在世界经济中的占比已由2003年的6%上升到现在的16%，对世界经济增长的贡献率达到30%。
On February 13, France's finance and economic minister, Bruno Le Maire, said the outbreak would reduce France's economic growth by 0.1 percentage points by 2020 and 0.2 percentage points by 2020... After all, China's share of the world economy has risen from 6% in 2003 to 16% now, contributing 30% to world growth.
法国财政和经济部长勒梅尔 图 | AFP我不是经济专家，但是我知道经济增速下降就可能造成失业，这就很让人担心了……征集令《新民周刊》现面向全国征集新冠肺炎采访对象和真实故事：如果你是参与抗击新冠肺炎疫情的医护人员或其家属，我们希望聆听你的“战疫”故事，也希望传达你的诉求。
