“来之前，说实话，心里没底，恐慌，但是真正到了武汉以后，看到热火朝天的工地，那么多人在拼命干活，心就踏实下来了。
"Before coming, to tell the truth, the bottom of my heart, panic, but really after Wuhan, see the hot construction site, so many people in hard work, the heart down.
我的想法就是既来之则安之。
My idea is to take things as they come.
火神山医院交付使用的那天晚上（2.3日），我发烧，37.8，吓了个半死，吃了药以后，第二天早晨体温就降下来了，然后直接就赶到了雷神山医院现场。
On the night of its commissioning (2.3 days), I had a fever, 37.8, which scared me half to death. After taking the medicine, my temperature came down the next morning and I went straight to the Raytheon Hill Hospital.
我现在还是有点咳嗽。
I still have a cough.
我女儿上午给我打电话听见我还咳（嗽），又哭了。
My daughter called me in the morning to hear me cough and cry again.
咳嗽不像发烧，它掩饰不了。
A cough is not like a fever; it cannot be hid.
我现在怕的是，回去以后，会被举报，举报说我们打黑工，‘钱自己挣了，但是病毒带回来了’。
What I fear now is that when we go back, we will be reported to be working clandestinely, 'Money earned, but the virus came back'.
网上（抖音、快手）也有说一些“逆行者”结束工作回到当地以后，被隔离，被举报，还有的被抓起来了。
On-line (jitter, quick hand) there are also reports that some "Reverse Walkers" have been quarantined, reported, or arrested after returning to work.
图/陈莉莉 发自湖北武汉反正，各人有各人的想法吧。
Tu / Chen Lilly comes from Hubei Wuhan anyway, each person has his own idea.
但也都是人之常情。
But it's all human.
火神山医院，我和我的工友参建了10多个房间，雷神山医院，我们参建了500多个房间。
Fire god mountain hospital, my workmate and I participated in the construction of more than 10 rooms, Raytheon Hill Hospital, we participated in the construction of more than 500 rooms.
2月3日晚上，患者就住进火神山医院了，明天（2月6日），雷神山医院就能住患者了。
On the night of February 3, the patient was admitted to Mount Fire Hospital. Tomorrow (Feb. 6), Raytheon Mountain Hospital will be able to house the patient.
明天，我们也就回家了。
Tomorrow, we're going home too.
”以下来自一线工人葛政委的口述。
The following is an oral account by frontline workers, Gerhardt.
他背后是参与火神山医院、雷神山医院建设的近万名一线工人。
Behind him are nearly 10, 000 frontline workers at the Mount Fire Hospital and the Raytheon Mountain Hospital.
看到那么多人干活，心里踏实了我现在（中午12点）还没吃饭，我看着工具，其它工友先去吃，吃完回来后替我，我再去排队吃。
I still haven't had dinner yet. I'm looking at the tools. The other workmates are going to eat first. When they come back, I'll stand in line.
我们吃得还好，体力活，我每次都让工作人员给我加饭、加饭、再加饭。
We had a good meal. Physically, I asked the staff to add food, rice and rice to me every time.
每天中午吃饭时间一个小时左右，11点半到12点半。
Lunch is about an hour every day, from 11: 30 to 12: 30.
昨晚我们做到夜里12点多，今天早晨6：40起来干活。
We made it past midnight last night and got up to work at 6: 40 this morning.
平时正常的话，是从早晨7:30工作到晚上8:30。
Normally, I work from 7: 30 a.m. to 8: 30 p.m.
当时我是看新闻媒体说这边在抢工期，缺熟练工人，我就是专业做这样工作（安装箱房）的。
I was watching the news media say there was a shortage of skilled workers and I was doing this professionally.
我就在群里发了一个消息，群友有30多个人，10多个报名要来的。
I just sent a message in the group, a group of more than 30 people, more than 10 applications to come.
自己想来是一回事，现实中，每个人都遇到了家人的阻拦。
I would like to think is one thing, in reality, everyone encountered the obstruction of their families.
我自己的话，我老婆不给来，母亲不给来，兄弟也不给来。
My own words, my wife will not come, my mother will not give, my brother will not come.
我就给她们做思想工作。
I'll do their mental work.
怎么说服他们呢？我就说我们就是专业安装这些的，我们不去谁去，对不对？其实那一瞬间，就想给国家做点事，她们（家里人）就说我偏执，自己想干什么就干什么，不顾及家里人的想法。
How can we convince them that we are the professional installation of these, we do not go who, right? In fact, the moment, they want to do something for the country, they (the family) said I paranoid, do what they want, regardless of the family members' thoughts.
我两个女儿，一个上初三，一个读高一。
My two daughters, one in junior high, one in high school.
她们俩是家里人唯一赞赏我的。
They were the only ones in the family who admired me.
也因为我的事，她们会经常看这里的新闻，有点风吹草动就打电话过来，尤其是每天新增的病例让她们发慌。
And because of me, they will often read the news here, a little bit of the wind on the phone, especially the new cases every day let them panic.
好多工友家人都不给来的。
Many of my fellow workers' families don't come.
我们第一批报名的有10个人，有两个被家人给拦下来了。
There were ten of us who signed up first, and two of them were stopped by their families.
所有手续都办好了，我打电话过去，他正在跟他老婆吵架，他老婆说，你要去就离婚了。
After all the formalities have been completed, I called and he was having an argument with his wife, who said that if you went, you would get a divorce.
图/陈莉莉发自湖北武汉我们出发的时候是1月28日，大年初四，当时村里每天都在广播，不让外出、不让聚会。
2007-9-24 16: 48 We set out from Hubei Wuhan on January 28, about four years ago, when the village was broadcasting every day and was not allowed to go out or have a party.
我们算是顶风外出了。
We're out in the wind.
当时组织者（中建三局）就说给我们办好了通行证，也跟当地政府、高速路都沟通好了。
At that time, the organizer (CCB 3) told us that he had done a pass for us and that he had communicated with the local government and the expressway.
我们就一路开着车过来，第一批一共两辆车，微型面包，一车坐7个人，后来又来了两辆车。
We drove all the way, the first two cars, mini-loaves, a load of seven people, and then two more cars.
出发的时候，我们放了长长的鞭炮，做了一条横幅（援建武汉火神山医院），给自己壮胆，找点信心，也是为了路上能走得顺利些，遇到关卡就不需要太多解释。
As we set out, we set off a long firecracker and made a banner (to help build Wuhan Fire Goddess Mountain Hospital) to embolden ourselves, to find some confidence, but also to go along the road more smoothly, encounter the checkpoint need not be much explanation.
来的一路，看不到人，有限的车也都打着横幅。
Come all the way, can not see people, the limited number of cars are also carrying banners.
到了河南信阳服务区，我拍了视频发在朋友圈，就是觉得服务区平时挤满了人，那时见不到几个人影儿。
To Henan Xinyang service area, I made a video in the circle of friends, is that the service area is usually full of people, then see few people.
这条路我2019年5月走过，当时也是到武汉，那时的武汉街道特别繁华。
This road I passed in May 2019, also to Wuhan, when the streets of Wuhan is particularly busy.
这次来就不一样了。
It's not the same this time.
街道上见不到人。
No one was seen in the street.
图/陈莉莉发自湖北武汉来的时候，心里没底，恐慌，到了之后，看到看这么多人在这干活，有六、七千人吧，心里有点踏实，但是再一看新闻又有点恐慌，总之还是疫区嘛。
2007-9-24 16: 19 [hide] 2007-11-19 15: 16 2007-11-26 09: 55: 00When Chen Li came from Wuhan, Hubei Province, she was in a panic. After all, it was an epidemic area.
但我想的是既来之则安之。
But I am thinking of taking things as they come.
一路开了800多公里，1月29号凌晨两点到的武汉。
Driving more than 800 kilometers, January 29 at 2 a.m. in Wuhan.
那天早晨我戴着口罩在军人体育场跑了会步，接着就是疯狂地赶工期了。
That morning I was walking around the military stadium wearing a mask, and then I was frantically working on my schedule.
我们工人这里有很多武汉当地人，大家工作在一起，也没有什么隔阂。
We workers here have a lot of local Wuhan, we work together, there is no estrangement.
经常会聊天，但是不会聊疫情，都是聊一些轻松的话题，都是为了减少压力。
Often chat, but do not talk about the epidemic, are talking about some light topics, are to reduce the pressure.
来的时候是荒地，房子盖好，我们就走了工地上，每天量两次体温，早、晚各一次。
When the time came, the waste land, the house was built, we went to the construction site, take temperature twice a day, early and late.
我有过一次高体温，就是火神山医院交付使用的那天晚上（2.3日），我发烧，37.8，吓了个半死，吃了两个药以后，第二天早晨体温就降下来了，然后直接就赶到了雷神山医院现场。
I had a high temperature, the night it was delivered to Mount Rushmore Hospital (2.3 days), and I had a fever, 37.8, which scared me half to death. After taking two pills, my temperature came down the next morning and I went straight to the Raytheon Hill Hospital.
当时特别害怕，加上自己有点咳嗽，心里特别恐慌，体温降下去以后才放心。
At that time was particularly afraid, and he coughed a little, in particular panic, the temperature dropped to rest after.
我现在还是有点咳嗽。
I still have a cough.
我女儿上午给我打电话听见我还咳（嗽），又哭了。
My daughter called me in the morning to hear me cough and cry again.
咳嗽不像发烧，它掩饰不了。
A cough is not like a fever; it cannot be hid.
图/陈莉莉发自湖北武汉我认识的一个卡车司机大年初二从连云港往武汉拉空调，但是回家时，家乡不让回，半路就被隔离了。
2007-9-25 21: 48 A truck driver I know went from Lianyungang to Wuhan on February 2 to air-conditioning, but when I got home, my hometown was not allowed back, so I was isolated halfway.
还有人会被举报。
Others will be reported.
我一个工友来的路上，被举报了，他们家乡人举报他偷偷跑出来干活挣钱。
One of my workmates was on his way home when he was reported to have sneaked out to work for money.
村里人就给他打电话，问他的情况。
The villagers called him and asked about him.
还有一个工友在路上接到家乡当地派出所打的电话，派出所说，你这样出去回家以后是要被判刑的。
Another worker on the road received a call from the local police station, the police station said that you go home after going out like this will be sentenced.
这两个工友都因为这种情况半路返回家了。
Both men returned home half way home from this state of affairs.
我这次来，父老乡亲中有一部分人是支持的，还有一部分人是不支持的，我回家的话，面临的肯定不全是欢迎。
I come here, some of my father's folks are supportive, others are not, I return home, the face is certainly not all welcome.
我现在怕的是，回去以后，会被举报，举报说我们打黑工，“钱自己挣了，但是病毒带回来了”。
What I'm afraid of now is that when I go back, I will be informed that we are working clandestinely. "Money makes money, but the virus comes back."
网上（抖音、快手）也有说一些“逆行者”结束工作回到当地以后，被隔离，被举报，还有的被抓起来了。
On-line (jitter, quick hand) there are also reports that some "Reverse Walkers" have been quarantined, reported, or arrested after returning to work.
反正，各人有各人的想法吧。
Anyhow, every man has his own opinion.
也都是人之常情。
It's all human.
但是我想我们会相信政府，不可能让我们失望的吧？图/陈莉莉发自湖北武汉现在在江西九江，湖北鄂州、咸宁，陕西西安，都要建这种医院。
But I think we can trust the government and not disappoint us.Tu / Chen Lily from Hubei Wuhan is building such hospitals in Jiujiang River in Jiangxi, Hubei Province in Hubei Province, Xianning in Shanxi Province.
我有一个工友差不多跟我同期，他去了福建，那是一个能装300多床位的医院，他觉得没有参加武汉的工作，有点遗憾。
One of my workmates was about the same time as me. He went to Fujian, a hospital with more than 300 beds.
我们做这个工作（盖板房），每到一个工地都是一块荒地，一边是挖掘机、推土机整地平，地基整好了以后，我们就盖房子。
We do this work (slab room), every construction site is a piece of wasteland, on the one hand excavator, bulldozer leveling, when the foundation is complete, we will build a house.
盖房的时候，水电什么的都没有，等所有的都齐了，我们又都走了。
When the house was built, there was no water or electricity, and when everything was there, we all went away again.
这次火神山医院、雷神山医院，比起以前，我们可能想的更多的是，房子建好以后，患者就能住进来了。
This time the fire god mountain hospital, thunder Shenshan hospital, we may think more than before, the house is built, the patient can live in.
也能为社会做点贡献吧，你不是什么什么之一，你就是一个农民工，但是也能做一些自己能做的事情。
Can also contribute to society, you are not one of what, you are a migrant workers, but also can do something on their own.
雷神山医院刚开始建设的时候，现场都在浇地，我们就先在军运会场地的外围把房子组装起来，这样能节约不少时间，工期是一定要保证的。
When Raytheon Hill Hospital was being built, the field was being watered, and we were able to assemble the house on the outside of the military transport site. This would save a lot of time.
工作过程中，每天干活本身不是那么累，沟通要更累一些。
In the course of work, daily work itself is not so tired, more tired to communicate.
有一天，我的手机整整用了8个小时，就是不断地接、打电话，微信沟通。
One day, I used my cell phone for 8 hours, it was to answer, call, and communicate by letter.
沟通最多的问题就是组装方式，以及材料的规格。
The most common problems are the way the material is assembled and the specifications of the material.
因为现场的材料不是一个厂家的。
Because the material on site is not from one manufacturer.
但是能感觉到发货发得很充足。
But I can feel the delivery is good enough.
很多时候，正在工作，突然就接了上级领导的指示，告诉你房型应该怎么设置，我要再交代给工人，来来回回，就这些事。
A lot of times, while working, I suddenly took instructions from my superior to tell you how the house should be set up. I'll tell the workers to come and go, that's all.
也有一些观念上的冲突，就是沟通吧。
There are also some conceptual conflicts, that is, communication.
我以前是个坏人这一趟出来比同样的工作周期，收入是要高一点。
I used to be a bad guy and this trip was a little more expensive than the same job cycle.
但钱对我来说，真的不是第一位的。
But money really doesn't come first for me.
有人也许会说，国家不缺你这一个人，但是如果每个人真的都接受这个说法呢？我最有成就感的是什么呢？火神山医院，我们进入的比较晚，我这个小团队（27个人）组装了10多间房子，雷神山医院，我们这一组组装了500多间房子。
One might say that the country is not short of you, but what would be my greatest sense of accomplishment if everyone really accepted it? Mount Fire Hospital, where we arrived late, my small team (27 people) assembled more than 10 houses, Raytheon Hill Hospital, and our group assembled more than 500 houses.
基本上，三个房间有四个床位，包括洗手间，洗漱间。
Basically, three rooms have four beds, including a bathroom and a bathroom.
图/陈莉莉发自湖北武汉我父亲想当兵，没当成，很向往部队，还对我说，你要去部队啊，当个官。
Photo / Chen Lilly from Hubei Wuhan My father wanted to be a soldier. He didn't take it for granted.
可能是因为这个原因吧，就给我取名叫“葛政委”，这是我的真名，身份证上的名字。
Perhaps because of this, I was named "the Ge political commissar", this is my real name, the name on the identity card.
可惜我能没能完成他对我的期望。
It's a pity I couldn't live up to what he expected of me.
我出生于1976年，我的父亲生于上世纪50年代。
I was born in 1976. My father was born in the 1950s.
我的家乡是江苏省连云港市东海县，那是一个盛产水晶的地方。
My hometown is Lianyungang City, Jiangsu Province, Donghai County, that is a rich crystal place.
这次来武汉的基建人员很多都来自江苏，网上都说我们是“基建狂魔”，这还是我女儿看新闻告诉我的。
Many of the infrastructure workers who came to Wuhan came from Jiangsu. They said we were "infrastructure geeks," as my daughter told me by reading the news.
其实我以前是个坏人。
I used to be a bad guy.
聚众斗殴，什么都做。
Get together and fight. Do anything.
老婆一直等我变好，我不能让她看不到希望。
My wife has been waiting for me to get better. I can't keep her from seeing hope.
前些年父亲病故，家庭十分困难，家人跟着受了很多罪。
A few years ago, his father died and his family was in great trouble.
我是走了很多弯路才明白人生什么时候改变都不晚，我要给家人撑起一片蓝色的天空。
I've come a long way to understand that it's never too late to change my life, and I have to prop up a blue sky for my family.
两年前，我才开始做板房安装工作，大家对我也很信任，我在工友群里一直坐着“老大”的位置。
Two years ago, I began to do board room installation work, people also very trust me, I have been sitting in the group of workers "boss" position.
这次（建设火神山医院、雷神山医院）经历对我来说很不一样。
This experience (building fire god mountain hospital, Lei Shenshan hospital) is very different to me.
怎么说呢，从一个负能量的人转变成一个有着正能量的人，是需要很大的决心和动力的！也因此感到自豪！身为一介平民也能为国家和社会做贡献，足也！我只上到初中三年级，平时喜欢看书，特别是《意林》《读者》之类的杂志和中国古代诗词。
It takes a lot of determination and motivation to change from a negative energy person to a person with positive energy! And I'm proud of it! As a commoner, I can contribute to the country and society.
（感觉）好的文章能洗涤心灵，诗词能把我带入一种忘我、洁净的意境。
(Sense) Good articles can wash the mind, poetry can take me into a kind of selfless, clean artistic conception.
我们领导找我谈过话，说是合同已经结束了，现在想让我们再留在这做点维修后续的工作，我现在还没跟工友们说，我个人想的是国家用得到的时候就在这里呗，但是不一定每个人都这么想，毕竟（2月6日）就要住患者了。
Our leader talked to me and said the contract was over, and now I want us to stay here and do some maintenance follow-up work. I haven't told my co-workers that I personally think about being here when the country can use it, but not everyone thinks so.
不管怎么样，我的想法都是好好干活，然后回家。
Anyway, my idea is to work hard and go home.
