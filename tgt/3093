新冠肺炎重症患者死亡率，比SARS低比普通流感高。
The mortality rate of severe patients with Newly Coronary Pneumonia was lower than that of SARS.
记者 | 黄　祺3月6日下午，武汉市第三医院光谷院区19楼8病区迎来“关门大吉”。
Reporter & # 124; Huang Qi's March 6 afternoon ushered in the "shutdown" of the 19th floor of the Guanggu courtyard district of Wuhan's Third Hospital.
随着上海市第一康复医院高天霖医生一声“关灯！”，11位医护人员身后一片漆黑，高医生转身关上了病区大门。
As Dr. Gao Tianlin, the first rehabilitation hospital in Shanghai, turned the lights off, 11 medical staff were left in total darkness and Dr. Gao turned to close the door of the sick area.
Play武汉第三医院病区关闭上海交通大学医学院附属瑞金医院副院长、上海第三批援助湖北医疗队队长陈尔真通过微信朋友圈分享这则好消息。
Shanghai Jiaotong University Medical School attached to the Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai third batch of assistance to Hubei Medical Team captain Chen Erzhen share the good news through micro-letter circle of friends.
随着病人数量逐渐减少，武汉三院光谷院区上海医疗队接管的两个重症病房将合并成一个病房，继续保留重症监护室和一个重症病房。
As the number of patients dwindles, the two intensive care units taken over by the Shanghai Medical Team at Wuhan's Guanggu Campus will be merged into one ward, retaining intensive care units and a intensive care unit.
上海第三批医疗队在武汉市第三医院累计救治了300余名病人，其中半数已经出院。
The third medical team in Shanghai treated more than 300 patients in Wuhan Third Hospital, half of whom have been discharged.
近日，院区平均每天接收其他医院转来的危重症病例大约有5人。
In recent days, the district has received an average of about five critical cases from other hospitals each day.
为了集中医疗力量救治这些人，医院决定关闭一个病区，医疗队管理的床位数从141张减少到85张，其中重症病房50张床位，重症监护室35张床位。
In order to focus medical attention on these persons, the hospital decided to close a sick area and the number of beds managed by the medical team was reduced from 141 to 85, of which 50 were in the intensive care unit and 35 in the intensive care unit.
病区“关门大吉”，是这支医疗队日夜坚守的成果，也表明武汉抗“疫”取得阶段性胜利。
The "closed door" of the disease area, the medical team day and night adhere to the results, but also shows that Wuhan anti-" epidemic "won stage by stage.
2月15日武汉大雪从最冷的寒冬到武汉早樱初绽，上海第三批援助湖北医疗队，已经在武汉新冠肺炎救治第一线连续奋战长达40天。
February 15, Wuhan snow from the coldest winter to Wuhan early Sakura, Shanghai's third aid to Hubei Medical Team, has been fighting in the front line of treatment of the new crown pneumonia in Wuhan for 40 days.
医疗队148名医护人员到达武汉初期，武汉新冠肺炎重症病患激增，医疗设备短缺、病房匆匆改建、防护物资紧张，重症患者的救治正处于最艰苦、最艰难的时候。
When 148 medical personnel arrived in Wuhan, the severe cases of Wuhan Xinguan Pneumonia surged, medical equipment was short, the wards were hastily rebuilt and protective materials were tight, and the treatment of the seriously ill was in its most difficult and difficult time.
参与和见证了武汉新冠肺炎救治几乎全过程的陈尔真副院长，在关闭病区当天晚上接受了《新民周刊》专访，介绍了医疗队到达武汉早期的情况，以及新冠肺炎疫情中值得总结的经验教训。
Vice-President Chen Erzhen, who participated in and witnessed the treatment of the new crown pneumonia in Wuhan, gave an interview with Xinmin Weekly on the night of the closure of the area.
新冠肺炎重症患者死亡率比SARS低比普通流感高《新民周刊》：病区“关门大吉”时您当时在做什么？是怎样的心情？陈尔真：楼上关灯的时候，我在楼下指挥，安排后续的事情。
CHEN ELCHEN: When the lights were turned off upstairs, I was downstairs directing and scheduling follow-up things.New Word and expressions influenceYouTheme (wwwyoutheme.cn) What were you doing when the area was "closed"? Chen Erzhen: When the lights were turned off upstairs, I was downstairs directing, scheduling follow-up events.
我们上海第三批医疗队接管的三个病区最初是130张病床，最高峰的时候加床加到145张，现在病人陆续出院，我们还剩下85张床位。
The three areas that we took over from the third medical team in Shanghai initially had 130 beds, and at their peak we added 145 beds. Now the patients are coming out of the hospital and we have 85 beds left.
我觉得通过这么多天的努力，我们取得了一些成果，病人治好出院了，这是值得高兴的。
I think through so many days of hard work, we have achieved some results. The patient has been discharged from hospital.
关掉这个病区，尽管有阶段性胜利，但是我们士气不能减，还是要提高警惕，尤其是安全医疗质量方面，要更加关注，真正实现做细、做精。
Turn off the sick area, despite the periodic victory, but our morale must not be reduced, but we should be vigilant, especially with regard to the quality of safe medical care, to pay more attention to, really do fine, do fine.
陈尔真副院长帮医护人员整理防护服《新民周刊》：您这批医疗队是年初四到武汉的，什么时候可以回家？陈尔真：时间还不知道，至少还要两个星期吧。
Vice President Chen Erzhen helped medical workers arrange protective clothing New People's Weekly: Your medical team arrived in Wuhan on the fourth day of the year, when can you go homeChen Erzhen: Time is still unknown, at least two weeks.
就像今天我们关闭一个病区，后面患者少了，我们就可以逐步关闭更多的病区，等只有少量病人才可以转到火神山、雷神山、金银潭医院。
Just as today we close a sick area with fewer patients behind us, we can gradually close more sick areas and wait for a small number of patients to be transferred to Mount Fire, Raytheon Hill, Gold and Silver Pool Hospital.
我们这里病区如果关闭，消毒后就可以恢复正常的医疗服务。
If we close the area here, we can get back to normal health care after disinfection.
现在武汉也要开始做好复工准备，医疗系统是首先被破坏的系统，医疗系统也需要逐步恢复起来。
Wuhan is now ready to go back to work, the medical system is the first to be destroyed, the medical system also needs to be gradually restored.
《新民周刊》：医疗队收治的全部是重症患者吗？陈尔真：全部300多名病人，都是重症患者，其中危重症患者有60位，占1/5。
NEWSWEEK: Are all the patients treated by the medical team seriously ill? Chen Erzhen: All over 300 patients are seriously ill, of whom 60, or 1 / 5, are critically ill.
现在剩下80多位病人中，还有30名是危重症患者。
There are now more than 80 patients left, 30 of whom are critically ill.
2月9日直升机从上海运送物资到上海医疗队《新民周刊》：疫情早期武汉重症患者病死率比较高，其中最重要的原因是什么？陈尔真：重症患者早期的死亡率确实比较高，主要是当时武汉的医疗救治力量不足，医护人员不够，医疗设施也不够，当时一床难求，很多患者得不到及时救治，加重了病情。
In the early days of the epidemic, Wuhan had a relatively high fatality rate, mainly due to the shortage of medical treatment in Wuhan, the shortage of medical personnel and the inadequacy of medical facilities.
最早患者病死率曾高达10%，现在已经降到了3%多一点。
The original case fatality rate, once as high as 10 percent, has fallen to just over 3 percent.
救治成功率提高，一个原因是全国各地医疗队来支援，设备、物资逐渐够用了。
One of the reasons for the improved success rate is that medical teams from all over the country have come to support them and equipment and supplies have gradually become sufficient.
还有一个非常关键的原因是，经过一段时间救治，我们对新冠肺炎病理生理机制有了深入了解和认识，找到了一些疾病加重的因素，采取了一些比较针对性的治疗。
Another very crucial reason is that after a period of treatment, we have a deep understanding of the pathophysiological mechanism of new crown pneumonia, found some aggravating factors, and adopted some more targeted treatment.
所以目前，在医疗资源比较充足的情况下，治愈率在不断提高。
Therefore, at present, in the case of adequate medical resources, the cure rate is constantly increasing.
陈尔真在病房中《新民周刊》：解决了人员和资源不足的问题后，重症新冠肺炎的病死率到底算不算高？陈尔真：我们有一些数据。
Chen Erzhen in the ward "Xinmin Weekly": solve the problem of insufficient personnel and resources, after the death rate of SARS is not high? Chen Erzhen: We have some data.
总体而言，新冠肺炎的病死率比SARS要低一些，比季节性流感要高一点，但高得不算很多。
Overall, deaths from Newcomial Pneumonia were lower than SARS, slightly higher than seasonal flu, but not much higher.
通过前面一段时间总结73000例病例的资料，我们知道所有新冠肺炎患者中，普通轻症患者占81%，重症患者占14%，危重症患者占5%。
By summarizing the data of 73,000 cases in the previous period, we know that among all patients with new crown pneumonia, 81% are common mild cases, 14% are severe cases and 5% are critically ill patients.
普通轻症患者中几乎是没有死亡的，重症患者的死亡率大概在将近40%，而危重症患者的死亡率高达50%以上。
There are almost no deaths among ordinary light patients, the death rate among the seriously ill is approximately 40 per cent, and the mortality rate among critically ill patients is over 50 per cent.
也就是说，新冠肺炎病情越重，它的死亡率越高。
In other words, the more severe the case, the higher the death rate.
从普通轻症肺炎发展到危重，是一个逐步进展的过程，我们要做的就是找到加重病情的因素，用有效的措施阻断进展。
It is a gradual process from common mild pneumonia to serious illness. All we have to do is to find the aggravating factors and block the progress with effective measures.
现在我们对病情进展中的一些关键因素已经有了比较好的方法，比如炎症风暴，我们有血液净化的方法，不久前还开展了用风湿性疾病的药物“托珠单抗”对抗炎症风暴的治疗。
Now we have a better idea of some of the key factors in the progression of the disease, such as inflammatory storms, the way we purify blood and, more recently, the treatment of inflammatory storms with the rheumatic drug "tozhul."
当然，最主要的治疗方式还是有效的抗病毒和免疫功能的支持治疗等等，它是一个综合的治疗。
Of course, the most important treatment is effective antiviral and immune support therapy, and so on, it is a comprehensive treatment.
在医疗资源丰富的前提下，新冠肺炎总体病死率不能说特别高，但武汉早期的情况是病毒传播速度太快，传播太广，所以新冠肺炎传染性很强，危害程度很大。
Under the premise of abundant medical resources, the overall mortality rate of New Crown Pneumonia can not be said to be particularly high, but the early Wuhan situation is that the virus spread too fast, too widespread, so the new crown pneumonia is very infectious, the degree of harm.
重症患者未来是否留后遗症有待观察《新民周刊》：最近您提到要重视重症新冠肺炎患者的康复治疗，为什么提出这个建议？陈尔真：我做了30年重症医学工作，早些年我们对重症病人康复不是很重视，当时我们发现重症病人出院后还是会有很多问题。
Why did you make this suggestion? Chen Erzhen: I had 30 years of intensive care work, and we didn't pay much attention to the recovery of the seriously ill patients in the early years, when we found out there would still be a lot of problems after they left the hospital.
比如说重症患者长期卧床，过去我们甚至不让病人活动，给他一些约束。
In the past, we didn't even allow the patient to move. We gave him some restraint.
病人长期不动，肌肉分解，等原发疾病治好，病人变得比较虚弱，活动能力下降，严重的还有认知功能下降。
The patient remains immobile for a long time, his muscles decompose, his primary illness is cured, he becomes weaker, his mobility is reduced and, in serious cases, his cognitive function is reduced.
最近5年来，重症医学开始重视康复的介入，病人就是戴着呼吸机，也尽可能要做一些康复训练。
Over the past five years, intensive care has focused on rehabilitation. Patients are wearing respirators and should do as much rehabilitation training as possible.
康复训练的及时介入，能够缩短病人依靠呼吸机的时间，也能缩短ICU治疗时间，缩短他的住院时间，提高救治成功率。
Prompt intervention of rehabilitation training can shorten the time that patient relies on ventilator, shorten ICU treatment time, shorten hospitalization time and improve success rate of treatment.
新冠肺炎病人的特点是有传染性，其他的和普通重症患者基本是一样的，所以在做好防护的情况下，我们对病房里的重症患者也进行了一些康复训练。
New Crown Pneumonia patients are characterized by infectivity, other patients are basically the same as the common severe patients, so we have some rehabilitation training for patients in the wards as a precaution.
我们首先对肺部功能做一些训练，新冠肺炎病毒首先攻击的还是肺部，促进肺功能的恢复显得尤为重要。
We first do some training on lung function, the new crown pneumonia virus attacks the lungs first, promote the recovery of lung function appears to be particularly important.
第二个，我们帮助患者恢复四肢活动的能力，这样等他疾病治疗好以后，还能改善他的生活质量，帮助他将来真正回归社会。
Second, we help the patient regain the ability to move his limbs so that, when he is cured, he can improve his quality of life and help him return to society.
上海市长宁区精神卫生中心主治医生季海峰为医护人员做咨询《新民周刊》：您很早就提出心理干预的重要性。
Shanghai Changning District Mental Health Center doctor Ji Haifeng for medical staff to do consultation "Xinmin Weekly": you have long raised the importance of psychological intervention.
陈尔真：对，康复的概念还包括心理康复。
Chen Erzhen: Yes, the concept of rehabilitation also includes psychological rehabilitation.
新冠肺炎疫情这样大灾大难，不管你是病人，或者是家属，或者是没有生病的人，都有恐惧感。
A major disaster like the New Crown Pneumonia, whether you are a patient, a family member, or someone who is not sick, has a sense of fear.
这次疫情中还有一个特殊现象，许多家庭成员互相传染，出现家庭聚集性地发病，这个对人的打击是比较厉害的。
This epidemic is also a special phenomenon, many family members infected with each other, the occurrence of family aggregation of the disease, this is a relatively severe blow to people.
2008年我去支援汶川地震救援时，这方面有一些经验，所以我觉得心理干预要重视起来。
I went to support Wenchuan earthquake relief in 2008, there is some experience in this regard, so I feel that psychological intervention should be attached to.
我们上海第三批医疗队里就有两位长宁区精神卫生中心的医生，到了武汉我请他们立即建立一个心理危机干预小组，建立一个心理咨询室。
In the third medical team in Shanghai, there were two doctors from Changning District Mental Health Center. When we arrived in Wuhan, I asked them to immediately set up a psychological crisis intervention group and set up a psychological consultation room.
不仅是病人，医务人员在疫情中也是受到打击的，早期那么高强度的工作，医生护士也受不了。
Not only the patients, but also the medical staff in the epidemic, the early intensity of the work, doctors and nurses can not bear.
当医护人员看到救治的病人死亡，他们也会有挫败感，会很伤心。
When paramedics see their patients die, they also feel frustrated and sad.
早期防护物资不到位的情况下，医护人员还要担心自己被感染。
When early protective equipment is not in place, health-care workers also worry about getting infected.
我们建立了心理干预小组后发现，面对面的交流比较困难，后来就开了一个公众微信号，搭建一个心理咨询平台。
When we set up the Psychosocial Intervention Unit, we found face-to-face communication more difficult and later developed a public micro-signal and a psychological counselling platform.
通过微信，心理医生跟病人交流，还发一些心理健康科普内容。
Through micro-letters, psychiatrists and patients to communicate, but also some mental health science content.
我们逐渐形成了“沪鄂情、心连心”这样一个心理咨询的品牌，开展了大量工作。
We gradually formed the "Shanghai Er feeling, Heart to Heart" such a psychological counseling brand, carried out a lot of work.
《新民周刊》：17年前SARS病人中有一些重症患者留下了后遗症，目前看新冠肺炎重症患者康复情况如何？陈尔真：最早出院的重症患者时间可能也就一个多月，所以目前还看不到病毒对患者带来的远期影响，必须要跟踪随访比较长的时间才能说。
NEW MINE WEEKLY: 17 years ago, some of the SARS patients left sequelae, how is the recovery status of severe cases of Newcastle Pneumonia? Chen Erzhen: The earliest serious cases may take more than a month, so the long-term effects of the virus on patients cannot be seen.
轻症的患者，我认为不大会有严重的后遗症，主要的问题可能是心灵上的创伤。
For people with mild illness, I don't think it's likely to have serious sequelae. The main problem could be trauma.
但是对重症患者，危重症患者，尤其是用了呼吸机的病人，未来是不是有肺部纤维化的可能性，这个需要关注。
But it is a matter of concern whether patients with severe or critical conditions, especially those with ventilators, are at risk of pulmonary fibrosis in the future.
从之前的病理解剖结果来看，患者肺部结构是被破坏的。
According to previous pathologic findings, the patient's lung structure was destroyed.
还有一个需要注意的是神经功能的紊乱。
Another thing to watch out for is neurological disorders.
为什么呢？因为这些病人在治疗的过程当中，或多或少有一段时间处于缺氧状态，这对神经细胞的损害肯定是比较严重的。
Why? Because these patients are more or less anoxic for some time in the course of treatment, and the damage to nerve cells must be severe.
患者远期的影响究竟如何，需要长期的观察。
Long-term observation is needed to determine the long-term effects of patients.
传染病预警系统不能流于形式《新民周刊》：这一个多月来，什么时刻是让您觉得最艰难、心情最沉重的时刻？陈尔真：刚来武汉的那几天，感触比较深。
The Early Warning System for Infectious Diseases can't be reduced to a mere formality New People's Weekly: What has been the hardest and most sombre moment you've had for more than a month? Chen Erzhen: The first few days in Wuhan, feeling deep.
我们来的时候医院刚刚临时改建为新冠肺炎定点医院，硬件上根本就达不到救治重症患者的条件。
At the time of our arrival, the hospital had just been temporarily converted into the New Crown Pneumonia Hospital, and the hardware was simply not up to the task of treating the seriously ill.
譬如说当时的氧气供应成了很大问题，因为重症患者每个病人都要输氧，但氧气压力不够，呼吸机打不起来。
The oxygen supply at the time, for example, was a problem because each patient in serious condition had to be given oxygen, but the oxygen pressure was not high enough for the ventilator to work.
那几天，每天四五位病人死亡，殡仪馆的车一起拉走，这个时候我真的是很无助，真的很伤感。
That day, four or five patients died, the funeral parlour car together to pull away, this time I was really helpless, really sad.
我找人也找不到，后来正好有一个新华社的记者联系我。
I couldn't find anyone, and then I was contacted by a reporter from Xinhua.
我想了个办法，请这位记者写内参，他当天晚上就把一份内参送到中央指导组。
I thought of a way to ask the reporter to write an internal reference, which he sent to the Central Steering Group that evening.
第二天，解决氧气供给不足的人来了，终于把这个问题解决了。
The next day, the oxygen shortage came and finally solved the problem.
这些基本的救治设备和条件有了，才没有之前那么多病人死亡的情况。
These basic equipment and conditions are in place to prevent the death of as many patients as before.
这之后，我们保持了十五天零死亡，再也没有出现死亡高峰。
Since then, we have had 15 days and zero deaths, and no more peak deaths.
后来新闻发布会上有关负责人也谈到了这个情况，早期供氧不足的问题，后来得到了解决。
At a later press conference the person in charge also talked about the situation, the lack of oxygen supply at an early stage, and was later resolved.
元宵节早上，上海医疗队医护人员到武汉第三医院上班《新民周刊》：在武汉40天，您几乎参与了新冠肺炎救治最关键的时期，也目睹了传染病带来的巨大冲击。
On the morning of the Lantern Festival, medical staff of the Shanghai Medical Team went to Wuhan Third Hospital to work for Xinmin Weekly. In Wuhan for 40 days, you were involved in the treatment of the new crown pneumonia, and witnessed the tremendous impact of infectious diseases.
您认为这次疫情中有哪些经验教训是值得总结的？陈尔真：这个过程当中最大的感想，首先是要有一个严密的传染病监测体系和预警体系，这个体系一定要进一步完善，功能需要强化。
What lessons do you think are worth summarizing in this epidemic? Chen Erzhen: The most important feeling in this process is to have a strict infectious disease surveillance system and early warning system, which must be further improved and the function strengthened.
比如说发热门诊，是非典留下的一个经验，但很多地方发热门诊流于形式，没有起到预警的作用，这是沉重的教训，是很可悲的一件事情。
Fever clinics, for example, are a legacy of SARS, but the fact that many local fever clinics remain a formality and do not serve as early warning is a hard lesson and a sad thing.
《新民周刊》：武汉有很多大医院，但还是难以应对发展如此快的传染病疫情，以后我们要怎么做才能“有备无患”？陈尔真：其实武汉的医疗资源已经很丰富了，武汉三甲医院有44家，上海只有38家；武汉1100万人口，上海2400万人。
Wuhan has many big hospitals, but how can we be prepared for such a fast-growing epidemic? Chen Erzhen: In fact, Wuhan has very rich medical resources, Wuhan Sanjia Hospital has 44, Shanghai only 38; Wuhan 11 million people, Shanghai 24 million.
比较下来武汉的医疗资源比上海还丰富，还要多。
Compared with the medical resources in Wuhan is more abundant than in Shanghai.
但是新冠肺炎疫情这样的一个沉重打击到来，还是难以应对。
But a major blow like the outbreak of pneumonia in the New Crown is hard to deal with.
我们要做到有备无患，平时要有备战计划。
We need to be prepared and have a plan for war in peacetime.
我们这样一个有14亿人口的大国，大部分人都生活在大中小城市里，流动性又很大。
In a country with a population of 1.4 billion, most of us live in small and medium-sized cities and are highly mobile.
我们要随时做好应对新发传染病的准备。
We need to be ready to deal with new infectious diseases.
我觉得医院要做到平战结合。
I think the hospital should be a peaceful union.
什么叫平战结合？比如一家医院平时按照正常的医疗秩序运转，一旦有紧急情况预警，马上就可以转变成一个符合疫情防控要求的医院。
For example, a hospital that normally operates under normal medical order can be transformed into a hospital that meets the requirements of epidemic prevention and control as soon as there is an emergency alert.
到现在为止，国内的医院还做不到。
So far, hospitals in the country have been unable to do so.
首先医院要留出一个空间，一旦出现紧急情况马上就能用起来，这种空间平常是要投入的。
First, the hospital to reserve a space, as soon as an emergency can be used, this space is usually to invest.
从预防的角度投入了这些钱，看起来好像一点用都没有，当紧急情况发生的时候它是无比强大的，可以节省很多很多的成本。
It doesn't seem to work to put the money into prevention. When an emergency happens, it's incredibly powerful and can save a lot of money.
还有就是物资的储备机制。
Then there is the material reserve mechanism.
比如说防护服，平常一点用都没有对不对？而且防护服有有效期的，但是一般有效期很长，5年、10年。
For example, protective clothing, usually no use at all right? And protective clothing is valid, but generally valid for a long time, 5 years, 10 years.
我认为医院就是应该储备这些物资，比如医院里准备个500套防护服，每年损耗10%用来训练，或者遇到传染性疾病偶尔用一下，5年为一个周期更换，这个是可以做到的。
I think hospitals should just stock up on that stuff, like having 500 suits in hospitals, losing 10 percent of their annual costs on training, or having infectious diseases occasionally replaced by a five-year cycle.
陈尔真在武汉与队员们一起开会安排工作《新民周刊》：疫情中是不是还体现出人才储备上的短板？陈尔真：专业的事情还是要专业人来做的。
Chen Erzhen has a meeting with his team in Wuhan to arrange work for Xinmin Weekly: Is there still a shortage of talent in the epidemic? Chen Erzhen: Professional things should be done by professionals.
这次全国各地派出4万多名医护人员支援湖北，我们重症医学相关的人才占了10%。
More than 40,000 medical workers were sent from all over China to support Hubei, and 10% of us were related to severe medicine.
重症医学在重症患者救治中有独特的优势，但同时，我们这些医生对于传染病防控的能力，比较薄弱。
Grave medicine has a unique advantage in the treatment of severe patients, but at the same time, we doctors have a weak ability to control infectious diseases.
医生数量不代表质量，我们还需要平时加强训练，及时掌握传染病防控的基本知识、基本技能。
The number of doctors does not represent quality, we also need to strengthen normal training, timely grasp of the basic knowledge of infectious disease control, basic skills.
征集令阳春三月，万物复苏。
Call for Spring March, all things revive.
在抗击疫情的战斗中，我们迎来了春天，《新民周刊》也迎来了新闻线索和故事征集的第二弹。
