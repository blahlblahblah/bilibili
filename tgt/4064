乘客接受流行病学调查、通过边检、提取行李之后，重点旅客再按照各个区的分流安排接受隔离，最终形成防控的闭环。
Passengers undergo epidemiological investigation, pass the border check, pick up the luggage, the key passengers are separated according to the division arrangement of each district, finally form the control of the closed loop.
记者| 王 煜摄影 | 沈 琳（除署名外）一架来自境外的航班降落在上海后，来自重点国家的旅客要经历严密的“闭环”防疫程序。
When a flight from overseas landed in Shanghai, passengers from key countries underwent strict "closed-loop" immunization procedures.
在这些工作中，上海公安千余名警力驻守浦东、虹桥两大国际机场，3月1日以来，已累计协助检查重点国家来沪航班400余架次，发现重点人员全部送医。
In these efforts, more than 1,000 police officers stationed at the two major international airports in Pudong and Hongqiao have helped inspect more than 400 flights from key countries in Shanghai since March 1.
他们的工作是如何做到严密细致又充满温情、获得旅客点赞？记者来到浦东机场做了现场探访。
How to do their job is to be meticulous and warm-hearted, to win praise from tourists? Reporters came to Pudong Airport to do a site visit.
Play“防输入”闭环如何打造？直击上海机场防疫现场13月20日上午，《新民周刊》记者在浦东机场T2航站楼国际到达出口看到，从这里走出的每位旅客都要接受工作人员检查护照的贴标，“绿标”旅客可以直接离开；而拿到“黄标”的旅客需要隔离，被引导到一旁的集散点。
Passengers coming out of Pudong Airport T2 Terminal 2 will be labeled by staff to check their passports, and Green Label passengers will be able to leave directly, while travelers with yellow signs will need to be quarantined and directed to a nearby distribution point.
3月20日，浦东机场T2候机楼，一名外国旅客在工作人员引导下走出到达口在集散点，目的地为不同地区的旅客被分流到不同的工作区域。
On 20 March, at the T2 terminal of Pudong Airport, a foreign passenger, guided by staff, left the arrival point at the distribution point and passengers destined for different areas were diverted to different work areas.
在目的地为上海的工作区域，16个区的工作点顺次排开。
In the working area, which is destined for Shanghai, the 16 districts are ranked in order of work.
每个工作点都有各区公安分局的民警支援。
Each site is supported by civilian police from district public security stations.
黄浦公安分局机场防疫工作负责人李勇告诉《新民周刊》记者，工作点由本区的公安、民政、卫健、街道社区等部门的人员组成，公安民警的主要职责是核实旅客在上海的居住情况，判断他们是需要居家隔离还是集中隔离，并将相关信息及时通知到后续环节的工作人员。
Li Yong, director of airport epidemic prevention at Huangpu Public Security Sub-station, told Xinmin Weekly that the main duties of the Public Security Police are to verify the residents' residence in Shanghai, determine whether they need to be isolated at home or in a centralized way, and inform the staff in the follow-up.
他说的“后续环节”，是需隔离人员在机场被统一转运到各个区的临时观察点，在那里他们将接受核酸检测并等待结果，检测阳性者将收治入院，检测阴性者再开始隔离措施。
"Follow-up", he said, is the need to separate people at the airport to be transferred uniformly to temporary observation points in the districts, where they will be tested for nucleic acid and await the results. Those who test positive will be admitted to hospital and those who test negative will start isolation measures.
在机场工作点的民警是“前端登记组”；在后方的黄浦出入境办，6位民警组建了“后台核查组”，每班12小时，确保24小时持续运作对接虹桥机场和浦东机场的现场工作点；在外围负责护送保障的20余名特警组成了“外围护送组”，全程做好重点国家入境人员从机场到居住地途中的突发情况应对。
At the airport, the civilian police are the "front-end registration team." At the Huangpu Immigration Office, six civilian police officers have set up "back-office verification teams" for 12-hour shifts to ensure round-the-clock operations at Hongqiao Airport and Pudong Airport.
根据旅客的目的地，他们将被分流转运3月6日，“前端登记组”的民警汪忠伟发现一名从日本入境的女子自行申报的居住地址、在沪联系人等信息与实际不符。
According to the destination, they will be diverted March 6, "front-end registration group" civilian police Wang Zhongwei found a woman from Japan self-declared residential address, contacts in Shanghai and other information does not match the reality.
民警通过进一步核查发现，该地址实际为网约房，也不符合居家隔离的条件。
Through further verification, the civilian police found that the address is actually a net room, also does not meet the conditions of residential isolation.
与网约房房东联系确认后，核查组断定该女子欲瞒报信息蒙混过关逃避隔离措施，在机场的民警当即对其进行教育并通知工作人员采取集中隔离措施，及时消除了隐患。
After contacting the landlord to confirm the contract, the verification team concluded that the woman wanted to hide the information to escape the isolation measures, the civilian police at the airport immediately educated them and informed the staff to take centralized isolation measures, timely eliminate hidden dangers.
李勇说，对于初步确认的旅客采取居家隔离的情况，后续还将由民政和社区工作人员进入旅客的住所实地评估，判断是否符合居家隔离条件。
Mr. Li said that in the case of initially identified passengers being segregated at home, civil affairs and community workers would then enter the passenger's residence to assess whether the conditions for residential segregation were met.
2实际上，在旅客走到机场的到达出口前，还要经历一系列防控程序。
In practice, passengers go through a series of control procedures before they reach the exit at the airport.
飞机降落在上海，位于停机坪时，海关和医疗人员将进入客舱，根据事先掌握的信息以及现场检测的情况，将发热旅客和密切接触者用救护车接走。
When the plane lands in Shanghai on the tarmac, customs and medical personnel will enter the cabin and pick up the hot passengers and close contacts by ambulance, based on pre-available information and on-site testing.
转运这些旅客需要疾控中心派来的负压救护车，但机场救护车比较熟悉机坪环境，车上也配备了基本的医疗设备；所以一般每次接送，一辆机场救护车打头作保障，浦东候机楼派出所机坪中队的警车垫后，一前一后护送负压救护车。
The transfer of these passengers requires a negative pressure ambulance from the CDC, but the airport ambulance is familiar with the airport environment and is equipped with basic medical equipment; therefore, it is usually provided with a front-to-back escort after each transfer, with an airport ambulance taking the lead and a police car cushion behind the airport squadron at the Pudong terminal station.
机坪上的驾车行驶不同于普通道路，有许多额外的安全规则要遵守。
Driving on an airplane is different from driving on an ordinary road. There are many additional safety rules to follow.
机坪中队的民警杜金星说：“机坪驾驶员都要有内场证，到STOP线是要停下来、要观望的，还有限速，所以一定要我们带着。
"The airport terminal driver must have an inside pass, STOP line is to stop, wait and see, there is a speed limit, so we must take it," said Du Jinsheng, a civilian police officer at the airport.
”国际机场分局的民警24小时执行护送救护车任务。
Civilian police at the airport police station escorted ambulances on a 24-hour basis.
3月13日，降落在浦东机场的CA936航班经海关登临检疫，发现4名有发热症状的旅客和2名报告服用过感冒药的旅客，这些旅客加上同机密切接触的另外30人，都需要立即转运。
On 13 March, flight CA936, which landed at Pudong airport, was quarantined by customs and found that four passengers with fever symptoms and two passengers who had reported taking cold medicine, together with another 30 people in close contact with the aircraft, required immediate transshipment.
这一个航班，民警的护送任务达到了31批次。
The number of civilian police escorts on this one flight reached 31.
在机场等候集中转运的旅客除了发热旅客和密切接触者外，其余的旅客将进入航站楼，接受海关和卫健部门的流行病学调查。
In addition to hot passengers and close contacts, the remaining passengers at the airport will enter the terminal for epidemiological investigation by the Customs and Health Department.
如果旅客在抵达上海之前14天内有重点国家旅行或者居住经历的，必须隔离14天。
If the passenger has travelled or lived in a key country within 14 days prior to his arrival in Shanghai, he must be isolated for 14 days.
在航站楼执勤点，民警的工作是维持现场秩序，对旅客进行劝解和法制宣传教育。
In the terminal duty point, the work of the police is to maintain order at the scene, passengers to persuade and legal awareness education.
浦东候机楼派出所副所长董海军说，他们最近就遇到了一家四口不愿意接受集中隔离的安排，滞留在航站楼不愿离开。
Dong Nai, deputy director of the Pudong terminal, said they had recently encountered a family of four who were reluctant to accept a centralized separation arrangement and stayed at the terminal.
“民警上前耐心地劝解，花了一两个小时，终于把他们说服了。
"It took the police an hour or two of patient persuasion to convince them.
”乘客接受流行病学调查、通过边检、提取行李之后，重点旅客再按照各个区的分流安排接受隔离，最终形成防控的闭环。
Passengers undergo epidemiological investigation, go through border checks and pick up their luggage, then key passengers are segregated according to the separate arrangements for each district, resulting in a closed loop of control.
3目前，一名旅客从下机进入航站楼到经过海关、边检，一般需要2到3个小时；如果是重点人员，还要接受各区工作点的登记查验和等待集中转运，需要更长时间。
3 At present, it usually takes two to three hours for a passenger to disembark from the terminal to pass through customs and border controls; in the case of key personnel, it takes longer to accept registration at the sector duty stations and to wait for centralized transshipment.
如何严把防控关口的同时稳定他们的情绪，让他们安心等待，上海各区的民警花了不少心思。
How to control the key points while stabilizing their emotions, so that they feel at ease to wait, Shanghai's police spent a lot of thought.
浦东机场的徐汇区工作点，民警正在核查旅客的居住信息浦东新区因为外籍人士较多，他们的机场工作点成了现场最忙碌的地方之一。
In the Xuhui District of Pudong Airport, the police are checking the residence information of passengers. Pudong New District is one of the busiest places on site because of the large number of foreigners.
浦东公安分局出入境管理办公室的胡司豪告诉记者：平均每天会有近300名来自重点国家的入境旅客来到登记点，其中欧美国家超过三成。
On average, nearly 300 inbound passengers from key countries, including more than 30 percent from Europe and the United States, arrive at the registration point every day, Hu Shihao of the Pudong Public Security Bureau's Entry-Exit Administration Office told reporters.
作为出入境办民警，胡司豪熟练掌握英语、俄语两门外语，除了完成对入境旅客的信息登记工作外，他做得最多的就是语言翻译、流程引导、帮扶求助。
As an immigration police officer, Hu Shishao is proficient in two foreign languages, English and Russian. In addition to completing the registration of inbound passengers, he did most of the translation of languages, process guidance, and help for help.
他的一个班持续12小时，登记旅客一波接着一波，没有片刻懈怠。
His class lasted 12 hours and registered passengers in waves without a moment's slack.
两名外国旅客正在接受民警的信息核查长宁区也是上海境外人士居住和工作密集的城区。
Two foreign tourists are receiving police information to verify that Changning District is also a residential and work-intensive area outside Shanghai.
很多以前来过上海的入境人员都会前往派出所申报住宿登记；而此次疫情期间，很多人担心因居家隔离无法出门办理登记而承担法律责任。
Many immigrants who have been to Shanghai before have gone to police stations to report for lodging; during the outbreak, many feared legal liability for not being able to go out and register because they were isolated at home.
为解决这个问题，长宁公安分局民警跨前一步，在机场工作点做信息登记核验工作时就推广旅客使用线上住宿登记，他们在手机中预先存好App二维码，在旅客等待期间，主动宣传网上申报流程。
In order to solve this problem, the police of Changning Public Security Station took a step forward to promote the use of online accommodation registration when checking information at airport workplaces. They pre-stored App two-dimensional codes in their mobile phones and actively publicized the online filing process while passengers waited.
3月6日至今，已完成网上申报1592 人次。
Since 6 March, 1,592 online filings have been completed.
黄浦公安分局民警李勇感觉到，这些天来他在机场登记的旅客里，中国人和外国人大致各占一半。
Li Yong, a police officer at the Huangpu Public Security Bureau, felt that about half of the passengers he had registered at the airport these days were Chinese and foreigners.
其中外国人来上海很多是因为工作；也有不少是家庭中有一人在上海工作，这次把全家都从国外接到中国暂居，因为他们知道中国的疫情防控很严格，这让他们觉得很安全很放心。
Many of the foreigners came to Shanghai because of their jobs, and many of them had family members working in Shanghai. This time, the whole family was taken from abroad to China for temporary stay because they knew that China had a very strict epidemic prevention and control, which made them feel safe and secure.
他说，来到机场的民警与外国旅客进行英语沟通都没有问题；如果遇上只会讲小语种的旅客，上海的疫情防控指挥部门为机场一线的工作人员配备了小语种志愿者的在线翻译服务，通过电话或者微信的方式，也能与旅客有效沟通。
He said civilian police arriving at the airport have no problem communicating in English with foreign travelers, and that if they encounter passengers who speak only small languages, Shanghai's disease control and prevention command provides online interpretation services for airport frontline staff in minority languages, and can communicate effectively with passengers by telephone or by micromail.
“递上一杯水，说上一句对方母语的问候，我们再做政策的解释。
"Offer a glass of water, say a greeting in the other's mother tongue, and we'll explain the policy.
这样一来，大多数外国旅客都愿意花上一些时间来完成防控程序，这也是为了他们自身的健康，他们也会理解配合。
As a result, most foreign travelers are willing to spend some time completing the control process for their own health and understanding.
”李勇说。
"said Li Yong.
派驻在机场的民警们长时间身着全套防护装备，无论是身体还是心理都经受着巨大的考验，同样的焦虑也经常发生在刚刚经历长距离飞行的旅客身上。
Civilian police stationed at airports wear full protective gear for long periods of time, and the same anxiety is often experienced by passengers who have just flown long distances, both physically and mentally.
长宁分局和浦东分局的民警想了个好办法，在休息时间用马克笔在防护服上画上可爱的漫画图案，配上加油的话语。
Changning police station and Pudong branch of the police think a good way, in the rest time with markers on the protective clothing on the cute cartoon pattern, with refueling words.
这些“皮卡丘”“小超人”不仅为战友鼓劲，也让旅客们开心一笑、缓解了他们的紧张。
These "Picchu" "Superman" not only to encourage their comrades, but also to make the passengers laugh, ease their tension.
机场防疫点的民警在防护服上画上了有趣的漫画。
The police at the airport cordon sanitaire drew interesting cartoons on the protective clothing.
上海市公安局供图3月20日上午11时40分左右，《新民周刊》记者在浦东机场T2航站楼遇到了刚通关出来的德国旅客Hasan。
A reporter from Xinmin Weekly met the German passenger Hasan in Pudong Airport at the T2 terminal at Shanghai Public Security Bureau at about 11.40 a.m. March 20.
他说，现在对所有人来说都是一个困难的时刻，但他感到这里的人都很友好；为了做好防控，“他们都在竭尽全力”。
'It's a difficult time for everyone, 'he said,' but he feels the people are friendly; 'they're doing their best to prevent it.'
