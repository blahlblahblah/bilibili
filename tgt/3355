在工厂和医院的工作完全不一样，我之前从来没做过这种工作，所以刚来时也是完全摸着石头过河。
Working in a factory and a hospital is totally different. I've never done such a job before, so I came across the river completely feeling the rocks.
我发现，首先得跟工人打成一片，先成为工人的朋友，再来更好地宣讲专业的医疗知识。
I found that first I had to get along with the workers and become friends with them, and then I had to preach professional medical knowledge better.
口述｜马晓飞整理 | 王仲昀2月27日，是我结束隔离病房工作后,在酒店隔离的第十天。
Wang Zhongfei: On February 27, my tenth day of isolation at the hotel was after I finished working in the isolation ward.
当天下午，我接到了医院通知，因为疫情逐渐得到控制，隔离期结束后我就不用再进隔离病房工作了。
That afternoon, I was informed by the hospital that I would not have to work in the isolation ward after the quarantine period was over, as the outbreak was gradually under control.
听到这个消息后，我立马给家里人打了电话，告诉他们自己即将“解封”的好消息，很快就能一家团圆。
Hearing the news, I immediately called my family and told them that I was going to "unseal" the good news and get together soon.
他们快一个月没见到我，我也有点担心他们，很想回家看看。
They haven't seen me for nearly a month, and I'm a little worried about them and want to go home.
不料，第二天医院又打电话来，说我们荆州有重点企业要复工复产，得安排驻厂医护人员去帮扶企业，搞好疫情防控和医疗保障。
Unexpectedly, the next day the hospital called again, said that we have Jingzhou key enterprises to resume production, we have to arrange resident medical staff to help enterprises, do a good job of disease prevention and health care.
他们想安排我去，问我有没有困难。
They wanted to arrange for me to go and ask if I had any difficulty.
犹豫了几秒钟，我几乎出于本能地说：“没问题，接受组织安排。
After a few seconds' hesitation, I almost instinctively said, "No problem, accept the organization.
”之后我又跟家人说了这事，他们多少有点失望。
Then I told my family about it, and they were a little disappointed.
因为头一天在电话里，我还告诉他们能回家，他们都开始收拾打扫我的房间了。
Because the first day on the phone, I also told them to go home, they all began to clean up my room.
现在，我已经在这个全封闭的工厂工作了11天。
Now, I have been working in this completely closed factory for 11 days.
自2月2日离开家，将近40天没回过家了。
She left her home on 2 February and has not returned home for nearly 40 days.
马晓飞此前在隔离病区从诊疗病人，到帮助工人我叫马晓飞，是湖北荆州中医医院骨科的一位副主任医师。
Ma Xiaofei, a former orthopaedic doctor at the TCM Hospital in Jingzhou, Hubei Province, from treating patients to helping workers.
此前，由于疫情暴发，我作为一名骨科医生，也接到了前往抗疫一线的通知。
Earlier, as an orthopaedic surgeon, I was also notified of a frontline attack as a result of the outbreak.
2月2日，在进隔离病区前，老实说我有点紧张、焦虑。
Feb. 2, before going into quarantine, I was a little nervous and anxious.
一方面可能是职业的关系，了解和接触到的相关信息更多，知道这个病传染性强，又暂时没有针对性的药物；另一方面，当时疫情还在发展，形势也比较严峻。
On the one hand, there may be professional relationships, knowledge and exposure to more relevant information, knowledge that the disease is highly contagious and temporarily non-targeted drugs; on the other hand, the epidemic was still developing and the situation was more serious.
离家前，我还想过，要不要把我银行卡账号密码什么的都写下来。
Before I left home, I wondered if I should write down all my bank card numbers and the like.
后来转念一想，没必要，本来家里也都是我夫人在掌管经济大权。
Then, on second thought, it wasn't necessary. My wife was in charge of the economy.
不过，等我开始和同事一起工作后，这种紧张感就逐渐被冲淡了。
But as soon as I started working with my co-workers, this tension gradually wore off.
我被分到荆州中医医院的隔离六病区。
I was assigned to the isolation ward of Jingzhou TCM Hospital.
我们病区主要收治轻症新冠肺炎确诊患者。
The main patients in our ward were diagnosed with mild New Crown Pneumonia.
在日常诊疗过程中，我发现病区的大部分患者或多或少都有些心理上的障碍，有觉得失去自由不配合隔离治疗的，有不愿面对自己病情的，有悲观厌世的，有自己在网上搜索治疗方案要求医生对照诊治的。
In the course of routine medical treatment, I found that most of the patients in the area have some psychological disorder, some feel loss of freedom do not cooperate with isolation treatment, some do not want to face their own illness, there are pessimism, have their own online search and treatment program to seek medical treatment.
所以，除了常规治疗外，我每个班大部分的时间都用在疏导和安抚患者的情绪上面。
So, apart from routine treatment, I spent most of my class trying to soothe and soothe my patients.
正应了特鲁多医生的那句“有时治愈，常常帮助，总是安慰”。
In response to Dr. Trudeau's words, Sometimes heals, often helps, always comforts.
我进去隔离病区时，正是疫情发展迅猛的时候。
When I went in to isolate the sick area, it was a time of rapid disease.
我们病区一共14个隔离病房，最严重时这些病房都收满了。
There were 14 isolation wards in our ward, which was full at the height of the crisis.
我们是中医医院，所以每天会收集每个病人的脉象、舌苔，汇报给医院的专家组，由他们给出个性化中医药治疗。
We are a TCM hospital, so we collect the pulse and tongue coating of each patient every day and report to the hospital panel for personalized Chinese medicine treatment.
这样的治疗方案，后续看来效果还是不错的。
Such a treatment plan, the follow-up seems to be good.
由于有海南的医疗队援助我们，所以到2月17日，连续工作15天的我结束了第一阶段工作，开始轮休。
With Hainan medical team assisting us, I finished the first phase of my 15-day working day on February 17 and began my rotation.
离开医院时，情况还不像现在这样好转，病人数量也没明显减少，所以领导也让我们做好准备，可能后面还要再来一线。
By the time we left the hospital, things were not as good as they are now and the number of patients had not significantly decreased, so the leadership had prepared us for another line.
接着就开始了在酒店的隔离。
Then began the isolation in the hotel.
2月27日，医院告诉我，隔离病区已经从原来的6个减少到3个，轮休医生后面也不用再去了。
On 27 February, the hospital informed me that the quarantined areas had been reduced from six to three, and that there was no need to go after the rest of the doctors.
以为再过几天能回家的我，第二天就接到了去工厂协助复工复产的任务。
Thinking that I would be able to go home in a few days, I received the task of returning to work the next day.
虽然刚接到电话我有些犹豫，但是打完电话，我仔细想想，觉得这个新的任务蛮适合我，毕竟我刚从抗疫一线下来，积累了不少经验能够帮助企业做好疫情防控。
Although I was hesitant to receive a phone call, but after the phone call, I think the new task is quite suitable for me, after all, I just came down from the frontline of the epidemic, accumulated a lot of experience can help enterprises do a good job of disease prevention and control.
29日晚上，我就到了工厂。
On the evening of the 29th, I arrived at the factory.
这是荆州当地一家法资企业的汽车配件生产厂。
It is the auto parts production factory of a French-funded enterprise in Jingzhou.
当晚发生的一件事更让我觉得自己没来错。
One thing that happened that night made me feel right.
原来，前一天该工厂有一对夫妻回来复工了，其中，那名女工人咳得比较厉害，她的丈夫也有点腹泻。
It turned out that the previous day a couple from the factory had returned to work, in which the woman worker coughed badly and her husband had diarrhea.
无论是他们本人，还是其他工友，在这个特殊时期，面对这种情况，都是人心惶惶、草木皆兵。
Whether they are themselves, or other workers, in this particular period, the face of this situation, are panic-stricken, grass-walled.
在我和我的护士搭档到工厂前，夫妻已经去医院完成了检查。
Before my nurse and I arrived at the factory, the couple had gone to the hospital for a check-up.
其实两人都没感染新冠病毒，女工人是普通肺炎。
In fact, neither of them is infected with the new crown virus, female workers are common pneumonia.
但他们回来后，情绪还是很紧张，总担心自己会不会被误诊，厂里面也有不少关于他们是新冠肺炎疑似患者的流言。
But when they returned, they were nervous and worried about being misdiagnosed, and there were rumors that they were suspected patients with pneumonia in the New Crown.
我了解到这个情况后，就跟他们在办公室里进行了一次近距离面对面的交流。
When I learned about this, I had a close face-to-face conversation with them in the office.
我就对他们说，不用太担心，我看过检查报告了，问题不大。
I told them not to worry too much. I read the report. It's not a big problem.
如果你真被感染，那我不敢坐在这里跟你这么近距离讲话哟。
If you were really infected, I wouldn't dare sit here and talk to you so close.
听完这句话，那两口子就笑了。
After hearing this, the couple laughed.
那天我记得我们聊了还挺久，足足有半个多小时，分别的时候，明显他们的精神状态就好了很多。
That day I remember that we talked for quite a long time, for a full half an hour, when the time for parting, clearly their mental state is much better.
后来，其他工人看到我们在房间里接触了这么久，也就放心了。
Later, the other workers were relieved to see that we had been in contact for so long.
这件事也成为我最近协助复工复产的缩影。
It also epitomized my recent efforts to help resume work.
在工厂和医院的工作完全不一样，我之前从来没做过这种工作，所以刚来时也是完全摸着石头过河。
Working in a factory and a hospital is totally different. I've never done such a job before, so I came across the river completely feeling the rocks.
我发现，首先得跟工人打成一片，先成为工人的朋友，再来更好地宣讲专业的医疗知识。
I found that first I had to get along with the workers and become friends with them, and then I had to preach professional medical knowledge better.
另外，在做好疫情防控的同时，又不能由于防疫过度而形成紧张气氛，毕竟我们工作除了防疫，更重要的是要帮助企业顺利复产复工。
In addition, in order to do a good job in the prevention and control of the disease, but also because of the epidemic prevention and formation of tension, after all, we work in addition to epidemic prevention, more important is to help enterprises resume production smoothly.
将当地防疫经验推广到全球工厂过去的10天，我一直待在工厂里。
I've been staying at the factory for the past 10 days trying to extend local vaccination experience to factories around the world.
每天完成日常工作以外，也总结出一些相关经验。
In addition to daily work, some relevant experiences are also summarized.
比如，我们设计了一套测试题，30%是关于安全复工，70%关于新冠肺炎本身。
For example, we designed a set of tests, 30% on safe return to work and 70% on Newcrown Pneumonia itself.
现在来厂里复工的工人，在经过我们的科普后，还得通过这个考试才能上岗。
Workers who are now returning to work in the factory will have to pass our popular science exam before they can take the job.
另外，由于工人们普遍年轻，平时下班后若自感精力旺盛，工友间喜互相串门。
In addition, because workers are generally young, usually after work if you feel energetic, workers like to visit each other.
但现在特殊时期，这是需要想办法避免的事情。
But these special times are something that needs to be avoided.
于是我们通过微信群向大家介绍了我们中医特色的八段锦，让工人们下班后在寝室可以自娱自乐，打发掉旺盛精力的同时，又锻炼了身体。
So we introduced to you through the micro-letter group of Chinese medicine characteristics of BaDuan brocade, so that workers can enjoy themselves after work in the dormitory, break off the exuberant energy, but also exercise the body.
目前我在工厂是24小时待命，只要工人们有需要健康咨询的，就可以随时来找我。
I'm on 24-hour standby at the factory right now, and workers can call on me whenever they need health advice.
除了我们医护人员，工厂还配备了一名专门的药物采购员。
In addition to our medical staff, the factory has a specialist drug buyer.
在保障安全的前提下，又大大提高了工人就诊的效率。
Under the premise of ensuring safety, the efficiency of workers' consultation is greatly improved.
现在是特殊时期，全城封闭管理，工人如果要自己出去看病，既不方便，也不安全。
This is a special time when the whole city is closed and it is neither convenient nor safe for workers to go out and see a doctor themselves.
我没想到的是，这些经验会有朝一日被推广到其他国家的工厂。
What I did not expect was that these experiences would one day be extended to factories in other countries.
前面提到，这是一家法资企业的工厂。
As mentioned earlier, this is the factory of a French-owned enterprise.
最近，随着全球疫情暴发，这家企业在其他国家的工厂也面临防控问题。
Recently, with the global outbreak, the company's factories in other countries are facing problems of control.
于是，有一天我在和工厂的相关负责人交流时，就想到可以把我们这段时间的做法总结后推广出去。
So one day when I was talking to the relevant person in charge of the factory, it occurred to me that I could generalize and summarize our practice during this time.
现在工厂的复工率差不多30%，等到差不多全复工了，我也就能回家了。
Now the factory is back to work at almost 30%, and when it's almost back to work, I'll be able to go home.
回家后，我得跟家人说声抱歉。
When I get home, I have to apologize to my family.
因为作为一名医生，在疫情的考验下，我觉得我交出了一份满意的答卷。
Because as a doctor, under the test of the epidemic, I felt I had given a satisfactory answer.
但身为丈夫、父亲、儿子，应该是不及格吧……然后，估计也没什么假期，还有我的好多老病人在等着我呢，我继续穿上我的白大褂上班去！本文图片均由受访者提供征集令阳春三月，万物复苏。
But as a husband, father, son, should be failing...... then, no holiday is expected, and many of my old patients are waiting for me, I continue to wear my white coat to work!
