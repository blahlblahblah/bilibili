部分同学在禁令颁布之初就开始四处搜罗免签国的消息，准备“曲线入境”。
Some students began to search for the news of the non-signatory countries at the beginning of the ban, ready to "curve entry."
泰国、阿联酋等签证手续简便并且当时暂未限制中国人入境的亚洲临近国家成为了这些留学生们的首选。
Neighbouring Asian countries with easy visa procedures, such as Thailand and the United Arab Emirates, and then no restrictions on Chinese entry, have become the students' first choice.
口述 |D整理 |王仲昀这场影响全球的疫情打乱了我和身边很多同学的计划。
Wang Zhongyun's global epidemic has disrupted the plans of many of my classmates and me.
我是北京某高校一名大三学生。
I am a junior student in a university in Beijing.
周围很多同学跟我一样，经过前两年国内的学习，在大三时想要去境外交流半年或者一年。
Around a lot of students like me, after the first two years of domestic learning, in junior high school would like to exchange six months or a year.
但当我们终于在去年下半年完成语言考试、申请、面试、租房、体检、签证等一系列繁杂的手续后，疫情爆发了。
But when we finally completed the language exam, application, interview, rental, medical examination, visa and other complex procedures in the second half of last year, the outbreak of the epidemic broke out.
按照计划，我现在应该已经在悉尼大学交换近一个月了。
According to the plan, I should have been exchanging at Sydney University for almost a month now.
但澳大利亚政府于2月1日颁布了旅行禁令，禁止所有曾在“中国内地”逗留的人入境，除非此人是澳大利亚公民、永久居民或其直系亲属。
But on February 1, the Australian government imposed a travel ban on all persons who had stayed in mainland China, unless the person was an Australian citizen, a permanent resident or a member of their immediate family.
所以我的航班被取消，预付了房租的住处也无法如期入住。
As a result, my flight was cancelled and my rent-prepaid accommodation was not available on time.
直到现在，我还留在老家。
Until now, I stayed in my hometown.
交换的学校去不成，北京的本校也回不了，只好在家上本校的网课。
The exchange of schools can not go, Beijing's own school can not go back, had to go home to the school's network classes.
我的同学中，有人庆幸自己去得早才没受到影响，有人申请签证至今杳无音信，还有人出境交换项目被直接取消，大家都有自己的疑惑。
Some of my classmates are glad they didn't get hurt, some of them haven't heard from them yet, and others have had their programs cancelled outright.
图 |悉尼大学研究生会悉尼大学已经按时开学，我们这些受旅行限制影响的中国内地学生不得不根据个人情况做出选择。
As the University of Sydney's graduate school starts on time, we mainland Chinese students affected by travel restrictions have had to make our own choices.
一种是在3月31日以前申请休学或延期入学。
One is to apply for suspension or deferment until March 31.
休学针对的是高年级学生，延期入学针对的是新生。
Suspension is for seniors, and deferment is for freshmen.
如果学生无法在2020年3月30日之前到达澳大利亚并开始在校园内学习，就应办理休学半年或一年的手续，然后在下学期或明年复学（取决于所学专业），学校免收手续费。
If a student is unable to arrive in Australia by 30 March 2020 and begins his / her studies on campus, he / she should take half a year or a year off and then return to school next semester or next year (depending on the subject studied).
这是学校最早提出的一种解决方案，前期申请休学或延期十分简便，但是2月下旬以来申请的手续变得复杂，需要提交更多的证明签证状态的材料，受理等待时间也更长。
This was one of the earliest solutions proposed by the school, and it was very easy to apply for suspension or extension in the early stages, but since late February the application process has become complicated, requiring the submission of more material attesting to the visa status and longer waiting times.
另一种选择是在家上前五周或整个学期的网课，每个悉大的学生可以试学一段时间，到3月底之前再决定要不要继续。
Another option is to spend the first five weeks or the whole semester at home, where each student can try it out for a while and decide whether or not to continue until the end of March.
澳洲的部分高校一开始只通知让学生休学，不提供网课，但在许多学生的强烈要求下增设了远程学习班并不断拓展网课的涵盖范围。
Some universities in Australia initially suspended students and did not offer online classes, but at the urging of many students, distance-learning classes were added and their coverage expanded.
假如学生持乐观预期，预计入境限制将会松动或者自己能在3月30日之前到校，可以只参加部分学期（前五周）的网课，到校后完成剩余实体课和考试。
If students are optimistic, it is expected that the entry restrictions will be relaxed or that they will be able to arrive at school before March 30. They will be able to attend only part of the semester (first five weeks) and complete the remaining physical classes and exams upon arrival.
如果学生持悲观预期，预计自己不太可能到校并在3月30日之前完成14天的自我隔离，可以留在中国上一整个学期的网课，还可以在寒暑假小学期参加悉大增开的密排强化课程来弥补不提供远程教学的部分特殊类型课程（比如理工实验、实地调研等）。
If students are pessimistic, they are unlikely to reach school and complete 14 days of self-segregation by March 30, can stay in China for the whole semester, and attend all the extra intensive courses offered during the winter and summer primary schools to make up for some of the special types of courses that do not offer distance learning (such as polytechnic experiments, field research, etc.).
还有一种选择是从第三国隔离14天后入境。
Another option is to enter the country 14 days after isolation from a third country.
澳洲政府颁布禁令后，由于其字面上仅限制了从中国内地直接出发的旅行，一些急于返校的学生想到了绕道第三国停留14天再从该国入境澳洲的方法。
Since the ban, some eager students have thought of making a 14-day detour to Australia via a third country because of the literal restrictions on direct travel from mainland China.
一些精明的旅行社嗅到商机，将其做成生意。
Some shrewd travel agencies sniff out business opportunities and turn them into businesses.
为了按时到校上课，部分焦急的同学尝试了这种方法。
Some anxious students tried this method in order to get to school on time.
他们中的很多人是应届毕业生或高年级硕士博士，无法按时毕业将会影响到他们继续深造、实习应聘、职业资格考试等方面的个人规划，休学的时间成本对他们而言过于高昂，远程学习和线上招聘的不确定因素也很多。
Many of them are recent graduates or advanced master's degree holders, and failure to graduate on time will affect their personal planning for further education, internship, vocational qualification examination, etc., the time cost of time off from school is too high for them, and the uncertainties of distance learning and online recruitment are numerous.
因此，这部分同学在禁令颁布之初就开始四处搜罗免签国的消息，准备“曲线入境”。
Therefore, this part of the students in the early days of the ban began to search for information about the non-signatory countries, ready to "curve entry."
泰国、阿联酋等签证手续简便并且当时暂未限制中国人入境的亚洲临近国家成为了这些留学生们的首选。
Neighbouring Asian countries with easy visa procedures, such as Thailand and the United Arab Emirates, and then no restrictions on Chinese entry, have become the students' first choice.
或许是中国在澳洲留学的学生非常多的缘故，有人在这个入境方案里看到了商机。
Perhaps because of the large number of Chinese students studying in Australia, someone sees business opportunities in this entry programme.
“让爸妈放心返校系列：一价全包，5666，限时2天”禁令发布后，在中国的澳大利亚与新西兰留学圈子中，出现了类似这样的广告。
"Relax Mom and Dad back to school series: one-price package, 5666, time-limited 2-day ban," similar ads appeared in China's Australian and New Zealand study circles.
我在家考虑了一周，觉得这种跨境的网课会受到各种影响，学习效果不会很好，性价比也较低；另一方面，随着疫情在全球扩散，在免签国和交通工具上的感染风险可能比国内还高，医疗物资产能和社会防护意识也不及国内，而且第三国曲线入境会造成不必要的食宿交通开支。
I spent a week at home thinking that cross-border classes would be affected, learning outcomes would be poor and cost-effective. On the other hand, as the epidemic spreads around the globe, the risk of infection in visa-free countries and vehicles may be higher than at home, medical production capacity and social protection awareness are lower, and third-country curve entry can result in unnecessary accommodation and transportation costs.
最后，我主动选择了延期，打算等疫情结束后重新办签证、租房子，争取明年2月再去悉尼大学。
Finally, I took the initiative to postpone my visit to the University of Sydney in February, intending to renew my visa and rent a house when the epidemic is over.
现在，禁令还没有解除，不过在学生组织和校友的坚持下，悉尼大学已经在3月6日发布了关于受到旅行禁令影响的中国学生的补贴声明。
The ban has not been lifted, but at the insistence of student groups and alumni, the University of Sydney issued a statement on subsidies to Chinese students affected by the travel ban on March 6.
声明里说，学校会根据个人情况发放不同程度的财务补贴。
The statement said schools would offer varying degrees of financial assistance depending on their individual circumstances.
现在情况变成这样，像我这样的学生多少会有点遗憾，毕竟前期准备还是挺麻烦的，语言考试、办签证、租房、体检，各种手续。
Now the situation has become so, students like me will be a little bit sorry, after all, the preparation or quite troublesome, language examination, visa, rental, medical examination, a variety of procedures.
好在我现在是大三，还没有到毕业季，总归是有退路的。
Fortunately, I am now a junior, has not reached the graduation season, there is always a way out.
