作者 | 张庆宁    出品|棱镜·腾讯小满工作室欢迎下载腾讯新闻APP，阅读更多优质资讯1月27日中午，李舒看到我们发布的文章——《这座城市每天可生产165万个口罩，但急需原材料》，她通过北京市朝阳区一位读者辗转找来。
Welcome to Tencent News APP. At noon on January 27, Li Shu saw our article, 'This city can produce 1.65 million masks a day but needs raw materials urgently,' which she ran through a reader in Beijing's Chaoyang District.
“我们已经复工，可以供应原材料。
"We're back to work and we can supply raw materials.
”李舒是江苏丽洋新材料股份有限公司（下称“江苏丽洋”）的采购人员，这是一家位于江苏省南通市的新三板上市公司。
Li Shu is a Purchasing Officer at Jiangsu Liyang New Materials Co., Ltd., a new three-board listed company based in Nantong, Jiangsu Province.
江苏丽洋拥有两条熔喷布生产线，熔喷布是生产口罩过滤芯的核心原料。
Jiangsu Liyang has two production lines of molten cloth, which is the core material of mask filter core.
当日下午16时，李明忠将李舒的原料信息和联系方式发到群内。
At 16: 00 pm that day, Li Mingzhong sent Li Shu's raw material information and contact information to the group.
李明忠是长垣市医疗器材同业公会会长，他搭建了一个微信群，群内有长垣市40多家医疗器械生产企业。
Li Mingzhong is the president of Changyuan Medical Equipment Trade Association, he set up a micro-group, there are more than 40 Changyuan City medical equipment manufacturers.
10多分钟后，李舒接到电话，电话那头是河南省鸿冉医疗器械股份有限公司（下称“鸿冉医疗”）的采购员林青，他需要一吨熔喷布，用于生产医用一次性口罩。
More than 10 minutes later, Li Shu got a call from Lin Qing, a buyer for Henan's Hon Ran Medical Device Co., Ltd. (Hung Ran Medical), who needed a ton of spray to make medical disposable masks.
江苏省南通市到河南省长垣市，共计800多公里，车程8-10个小时左右。
Nantong City, Jiangsu Province to Changyuan City, Henan Province, a total of more than 800 km, 8-10 hours by car.
两家企业却被运输难住了，因为找不到货车司机。
The two companies were bogged down in transport because the truck driver could not be found.
生产医用口罩滤芯的原料熔喷布物流快递全网停运27日晚上，江苏丽洋把这吨熔喷布打包，着手联系物流快递公司。
The raw material that produces medical mask filter core melts cloth logistics express delivery 27 evening, Jiangsu Liyang pack this ton of melt-jet fabric, set out to contact logistics express company.
“找了好多司机，都不愿跑，担心高速公路不通畅。
"Looking for a lot of drivers, do not want to run, worried that the highway is not smooth.
”当晚8点，李舒拨通李明忠电话，希望他想想办法，“能不能给我们开个证明上高速？”李明忠咨询了长垣市当地货车司机。
Li called Li Mingzhong at 8: 00 that evening, hoping he would find a way to "give us a certificate to go on the highway?" Li consulted the local van driver in Changyuan.
这位货车司机26日拉着物资去向北京，进出北京收费站，测完体温即被放行。
The truck driver pulled supplies to Beijing on the 26th, access to the Beijing toll station, temperature was released.
他又咨询了一位当地货车司机，确认高速公路长垣出入口同样只需测量体温。
He consulted a local truck driver and confirmed that the freeway ramp also required only temperature measurements.
“你直接和司机说，高速和空运都没问题。
"Tell the driver straight away that there's nothing wrong with high speed or air transport.
如果有问题，可以给我或鸿冉医疗的人打电话，我们再想办法。
If you have questions, you can call me or Hon Ran Healthcare. We can do something about it.
”听李明忠说完这话，李舒稍稍放心了。
"Li Shu was relieved to hear Li Ming-chung say that.
虽是如此，南通绝大部分物流、快递公司尚未营业，在当地找到货车司机绝非易事，“我们之前发往昆明、长春、乌鲁木齐的熔喷布，走的是顺丰空运。
Even so, the vast majority of Nantong logistics and express delivery companies are not yet open, and it is not easy to find truck drivers locally. "We have previously sent to Kunming, Changchun, Urumqi, using Shunfeng airfreight.
”江苏丽洋董事长尤祥银介绍，1月23日发往乌鲁木齐的那吨，运费两万多块，“在平常，发乌鲁木齐一样可以走陆路，一吨运费四五千元。
Yu Xiangyin, chairman of Jiangsu Liyang, said the tonnage sent to Urumqi on January 23 cost more than 20,000 yuan to transport.
”江苏丽洋发往乌鲁木齐的熔喷布一位物流业内人士表示，春节期间，只有顺丰、邮政在部分城市间提供有限度运输，京东在建有自营仓的城市提供末端配送，德邦等快递公司会在部分区域针对特定运输需求安排人员。
During the Spring Festival, only Shunfeng and postal services provided limited transportation between some cities, and Jingdong provided terminal distribution in cities with their own warehouses, and express delivery companies such as De Pont would arrange personnel for specific transport needs in some areas, according to a logistics insider sent by Jiangsu Liyang to Urumqi.
“除此之外，绝大多数物流、快递公司全网络停运。
"In addition, the vast majority of logistics, express delivery company network shut down.
”这位物流业内人士称，之所以出现这种现象，是因在全国大物流16万亿的市场规模中，工业企业的原材料运输、半成品和零配件供应链、商贸批零运输占据绝对大头。
The logistics insider said the phenomenon was driven by the fact that industrial companies accounted for the lion's share of the $16 trillion national logistics market in raw material transport, supply chains for semi-finished goods and parts, and zero transport for business.
国家邮政局报告显示，2018年全国快递业务量507.1亿件，快递业务收入6038·4亿元，占到全国大物流市场规模的3.7%左右。
The National Post Office reports that in 2018, China's express delivery business totaled 50.71 billion pieces, with express delivery revenue of 60.384 billion yuan, accounting for 3.7 percent of the nation's total logistics market.
“工业加工企业春节基本歇业，社会物流需求大规模减少。
"Industrial processing enterprises basically closed the Spring Festival, social logistics needs to reduce large-scale.
再加上春节人口迁徙，线上购物需求明显减少，难以支撑起物流、快递企业的全国性运输网络。
In addition to the Spring Festival population migration, online shopping needs significantly reduced, it is difficult to support logistics, express delivery enterprises nationwide transport network.
”这位物流业内人士称，相比正常营业，车辆空驶、转运场严重不饱和来说，全面停业是更好的减亏方式。
The logistics insider said a full shutdown would be a better way to reduce losses than normal business, with vehicles flying empty and transit yards severely under-saturated.
此次疫情出现，顺丰、德邦等快递公司发起绿色通道服务，运力主要来自企业提前预留和紧急调度的物流资源。
This outbreak occurred, Shunfeng, Debang and other express delivery companies launched green channel services, capacity mainly from enterprises pre-reservation and emergency scheduling of logistics resources.
终于找到货车司机南通到长垣只有800多公里，空运性比价太低，适合陆路运输。
Finally found the truck driver southbound to Changyuan only more than 800 km, air transport ratio is too low, suitable for land transport.
李舒四处寻找司机。
Li Shu looked around for the driver.
她咨询了韵达等快递公司南通网点，得到的回复是，“‘至少初八才接单营业，而且凑够一车才发货。
She consulted Rounda express delivery company Nantong network, the response was, 'At least eight days after the order, and a carload of shipping.
’一车可以装50立方米的熔喷布，我们只发一吨，也就八九立方米。
A carton can hold 50 cubic meters of spray. We only send one ton, or eighty-nine cubic meters.
”她又开始联系正在休假的快递公司司机，“看对方愿不愿接点私活。
"She contacted the express company driver on leave again." Would you like to have some private work?
”“有人开口要八千块，有人开口要九千块，”按照行规，这笔运费由鸿冉医疗支付，该公司采购员林青没有答应，“太贵了。
"Someone asked for 8,000 for it and someone asked for 9,000 for it," said Lin Qing, a buyer for Hon Ran, who was not willing to pay the freight.
平时从南通进吨货，司机的过路费、油费等成本一千多块，正常价格两三千块。
Normally from Nantong incoming tons of goods, the driver's tolls, fuel and other costs of more than 1,000, the normal price of two or three thousand dollars.
”“现在供货商价格高，物流又涨价，下一次进货接着涨咋办？”说这话时，林青正在公司忙活，鸿冉医疗同样要解决“封路”问题，“员工都住村里，村里不让他们出来，我们正发愁人手呢。
With the prices of suppliers high and logistics going up again, what's the next time you want to buy themLin Qing was busy with the company and HongRan Medical was also grappling with the problem of road closure.
”该公司建有两条医用一次性口罩生产线，全负荷运转需要近百名员工。
The company has two production lines for medical disposable masks, which require nearly 100 employees to run at full capacity.
27日深夜，李舒终于找到一位司机，“我们把价格谈到五千块。
Late at night on the 27th, Li Shu finally found a driver. "We talked the price down to five thousand dollars.
首先是对方跑过去一趟，只能空车回来，第二是现在是春节休假。
First, the other side ran a trip, can only empty back, the second is the Spring Festival holiday.
不能让人家吃亏。
No one should be disadvantaged.
”28日9时许，这位司机在江苏丽洋厂区装货上车，又去另一工厂装了一批货，开上驶往长垣市的沈海高速。
"At about 9 a.m. on the 28th, the driver loaded his truck at Jiangsu's Liyang Factory and went to another factory to load a load on the Shen-hai expressway bound for Changyuan.
他依旧有些忐忑，担心在高速公路上某个收费站被拦下。
He was still scared and worried about being stopped at a toll booth on the highway.
行驶途中，一则新闻弹出手机屏幕：“公安部要求优先保障救护车辆、防疫车辆和运送医护人员、药品器械、民生物资等车辆通行。
"The Ministry of Public Security requires that priority be given to ensuring the passage of ambulance vehicles, epidemic prevention vehicles and vehicles carrying medical personnel, medical equipment and civilian goods.
对未经批准擅自设卡拦截、断路阻断交通等违法行为，要立即报告党委、政府，依法稳妥处置，维护正常交通秩序。
Unauthorized card-blocking, road-breaking and other illegal activities shall be reported immediately to the Party committee and the government for proper handling in accordance with the law so as to maintain normal traffic order.
”这位司机多少踏实了一些。
The driver was more or less relieved.
产业链正在苏醒江苏丽洋董事长尤祥银操心的不是物流，而是熔喷布的原料供应。
Industry chain is awakening Jiangsu Liyang chairman Yuxiang Yin worried about not the logistics, but the raw material supply of melting cloth.
该公司生产的熔喷布以聚丙烯为主要原料，具有过滤性、屏蔽性、绝热性和吸油性，用于生产口罩滤芯。
The company produces melts with polypropylene as the main raw material, filtration, shielding, insulation and oil absorption, used in the production of mask filter core.
旗下医用口罩滤材规格分别是用于生产符合YY/T0969标准的医用一次性口罩滤芯、用于生产复合YY 0469-2011标准的医用外科口罩滤芯、用于生产符合GB 19083-2010标准的医用防护口罩（例如美国3M公司的N95口罩）滤芯。
Its medical mask filter material specifications are used to produce YY / T0969 medical disposable mask filter core, medical surgical mask core for complex YY 0469-2011 standard, medical mask core for GB 19083-2010 standard (e.g. 3M N95 mask).
“现在民众对口罩，尤其是对N95口罩的需求量特别大，”尤祥银说，N95口罩滤芯纤维直径0.3微米，过滤原理是静电吸附，适合医务人员在高危易传染的空气环境中佩戴，用于捕获空气中极小的颗粒物。
"There is a huge demand for face masks, especially for N95 masks," Yushang said, adding that the N95 mask filter core is 0.3 micron in diameter and is based on the principle of electrostatic adsorption, suitable for use by medical staff in high-risk air environments to capture very small particles in the air.
“一般老百姓配套口罩的目的是防范唾液等飞沫，医用一次性口罩和医用外科口罩应该够用了，没必要盲目追求N95这种高端产品，”尤祥银眼看着N95滤芯的价格暴涨，继而又推高聚丙烯等上游原料价格。
"The general population's purpose is to prevent froth, such as saliva, medical disposable masks and surgical masks should be enough, there is no need to blindly pursue N95 such high-end products," said Yu, watching the price of N95 filter cores soar, which in turn pushed up prices of upstream raw materials such as polypropylene.
“聚丙烯同样不好搞，”尤祥银介绍，这类化工材料的生产企业除中石油、中石化等央企下属公司之外，绝大多数是民营企业，“春节开工的肯定不多，我们同样要四处找原料。
"Polypropylene is just as difficult to get rid of," said Yu, adding that the vast majority of the companies that produce such chemicals are private-sector companies, including PetroChina and Sinopec.
”江苏丽洋工厂内存放的生产原料李明忠认为，口罩等医疗防护用品属于结构性短缺，“口罩生产商面临熔喷布、无纺布等原料短缺问题，这些原料厂缺少聚乙烯、聚丙烯等货源。
Li Mingzhong, a raw material stored in Jiangsu's Liyang factory, said medical protection products such as masks were structurally deficient. "Mask makers face shortages of raw materials such as melts and nonwoven fabrics, which lack supplies such as polyethylene and polypropylene.
这又需要化工材料产业链尽快启动生产。
This requires chemical materials industry chain to start production as soon as possible.
与此同时，物流等中间环节同样得动起来。
At the same time, logistics and other intermediaries have to move.
”但也不乏利好消息，例如江苏丽洋这类熔喷布原料商已经启动生产。
But there is also good news, such as the fact that smelter manufacturers such as Jiangsu Liyang have started production.
“27日上午，我们开始检修生产线，让机器先热起来，再把电和水检查了一遍。
On the morning of the 27th we began to overhaul the production line, warmed up the machines, and checked the electricity and water again.
等到下午，两条生产线正式启动。
By the afternoon, two production lines had been officially launched.
”李舒表示，他们一天可以投入市场七吨左右的熔喷布。
Mr Li says they can put around seven tons of spray on the market a day.
不仅如此，天津泰达旗下天津泰达洁净材料有限公司拥有7条熔喷布生产线，总产能达到7000吨/年。
Not only that, Tianjin Teda Clean Materials Co. Ltd. has seven production lines of fusible jet fabric, with a total capacity of 7,000 tons / year.
科技日报报道显示，泰达洁净根据疫情发展紧急启动了四条生产线，一天产能达到10吨，用于700万到800万只口罩的生产。
According to the Technology Daily report, Teddy Cleansing has urgently launched four production lines with a capacity of 10 tons a day to produce between 7 million and 8 million masks.
“随着时间推移，原材料跟上了，预计情况将有所改善。
"Raw materials have kept up over time and improvements are expected.
”据尤祥银观察，目前产业链上下游正在苏醒，“很多企业都像我们一样提前开工。
"According to Yue Xiangyin, the current industry chain is waking up," a lot of enterprises like us to start ahead of schedule.
”得益于此，在产业链终端，鸿冉医疗这类长垣市口罩生产商同样筹备生产。
Benefiting from this, manufacturers such as Hon Ran Medical are also preparing for production at the end of the industrial chain.
按照口罩生产流程，在熔喷布、无纺布等原材料到货后，先分切成小卷，放上生产线，通过高频焊接压制成口罩，再经过整理检查、人工装袋、灭菌16小时、解析库挥发灭菌气体两周之后，符合质量标准的口罩将通过物流、销售环节进入市场。
In accordance with the mask production process, after the raw materials such as melt-jet cloth, non-woven fabric, and other raw materials, cut into small volumes, put on the production line, through high-frequency welding into a mask, after finishing screening, manual packaging, sterilization 16 hours, parsing the library volatile sterilization gas for two weeks, quality-compliant masks will enter the market through logistics, marketing links.
这吨800公里加急的熔喷布可用于70万到80万只医用一次性口罩的生产。
The 800-kilometer accelerated spray can be used to produce between 700,000 and 800,000 medical disposable masks.
