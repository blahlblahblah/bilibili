”由新天地教会引爆、以大邱和庆北为中心的韩国疫情“至暗时刻”似乎已告一段落。
South Korea's "darkest hour," triggered by the Church of Xintiandi and centered on Daegu and Gyeongbei, seems over.
据韩国中央防疫对策本部3月23日通报，截至当天零时，韩国较昨日零时新增64例新冠病毒感染病例，累计确诊8961例，死亡增至111例，治愈增至3166例。
By 0000 hours on the same day, the Republic of Korea had 64 new cases of Crested Virus infection, with 8,961 confirmed cases, 111 deaths and 3,166 cases cured.
新增的64例主要来自大邱（24例）、京畿道（14例）、首尔（6例）以及入境检疫（13例），是2月21日（新增74例）韩国确诊病例数井喷式增长以来的最低值，创32天来最低。
The 64 new cases came mainly from Daegu (24 cases), Kyonggi province (14 cases), Seoul (6 cases) and immigration quarantine (13 cases), the lowest number since the well-blowout increase in South Korea on February 21 (74 new cases), the lowest in 32 days.
死亡病例则较前一天增加7例，累计治愈并解除隔离病例共3166例，较前一日增加257例。
The number of deaths increased by 7 cases compared with the previous day, and the cumulative number of cases cured and resolved was 3,166, 257 more than the previous day.
自3月13日以来，治愈人数已连续11天高于新增病例。
Since 13 March, the number of cured cases has been higher than the number of new cases for 11 consecutive days.
此外，确诊病例的病死率也低于全球平均水平。
In addition, the fatality rate for confirmed cases is below the global average.
根据世卫组织3月3日的估算，全球新冠肺炎的死亡率约为3.4%。
According to a WHO estimate dated 3 March, the global mortality rate from Newly Coronary Pneumonia is about 3.4 per cent.
按照23日的数据，韩国的新冠肺炎病死率为1.24%，接近全球平均水平的三分之一。
South Korea's death rate from pneumonia on the 23rd was 1.24 percent, nearly a third of the global average.

目前，在确诊病例数破千的海外国家中，只有韩国呈现出明显的放缓趋势。
South Korea is the only overseas country with a record number of confirmed cases to show a significant slowdown.
几乎在同一时段爆发大范围疫情的意大利，其确诊及死亡人数仍在急剧增长，截至当地时间22日18时，意大利已累计确诊59138例病例，死亡5476例，病死率高达9.3%。
The number of confirmed cases and deaths has risen sharply in Italy, where almost the same period of time has seen a sharp rise, with a cumulative total of 59138 confirmed cases and 5,476 deaths, a fatality rate of 9.3 per cent.
除确诊患者年龄相对更年轻以外，韩国的低病死率主要得益于采取早期诊断、迅速开展隔离和诊治，将扩散降到了最低。
In addition to the relatively young age of confirmed patients, the low mortality rate in Korea is largely due to early diagnosis, rapid isolation and diagnosis, which minimizes the spread.
从2月4日首款检测试剂盒获批至今，韩国累计已给31.5万人进行了病毒检测，相当于每160人中，就有1人接受了检测，日检测能力达2万人。
Since the first test kit was approved on February 4, 315,000 people have been tested, equivalent to one in 160, with a daily detection capacity of 20,000.
与此同时，韩国针对确诊患者也采取了密切的隔离追踪措施，及时锁定相关接触者，并在地图等应用程序上更新了确诊患者的行动轨迹，供民众自查。
At the same time, the Republic of Korea has implemented close isolation measures for confirmed patients, timely identification of relevant contacts and updating of the locus of action of confirmed patients on applications such as maps for public scrutiny.
世卫组织总干事谭德塞18日也提及，韩国在面临社区传播加速时，并没有“投降”，数周以来，日新增确诊病例一直在下降，从高峰时期的超900例，逐步降至两位数水平。
The World Health Organization's director general, Roger Tupper, said Wednesday that South Korea did not "surrender" in the face of accelerating community transmission, and that the number of newly confirmed cases has been declining from a peak of more than 900 cases to double-digit levels over the past few weeks.
除了采取早期诊断和隔离措施以外，“分级诊疗”策略也在韩国抗疫过程中发挥了很大作用。
In addition to early diagnosis and isolation measures, the "tiered approach" strategy has also played a major role in the fight against the epidemic in Korea.
与中国情形一样，在疫情爆发之初，韩国曾将所有感染者和隔离者都接到医院治疗，但随着确诊与疑似病例激增，医疗资源很快告急，疫情“重灾区”大邱等地随即出现了“一床难求”的局面。
As in China, South Korea treated all those infected and quarantined in hospitals at the start of the outbreak, but with a surge in cases of diagnosis and suspicion, medical resources quickly ran out of resources, and Daegu, the epicentre of the epidemic, was left with a "bed of problems."
统计数据显示，截至去年12月，韩国的负压病房床位仅为1027张，除首尔（383张）和京畿道（143张）以外，釜山、庆尚南道、大邱、仁川等地的床位均不到100张。
Statistics showed that there were only 1,027 beds in negative pressure wards in South Korea as of December, with fewer than 100 beds in Busan, Gyeonggi Province, Daegu and Incheon, in addition to Seoul (383) and Gyeonggi province (143).
即使是截至2月22日的数据，韩国公共与民营医院一共也仅拥有1077张负压病房床位。
Even as of February 22, there were only 1,077 negative-pressure beds in public and private hospitals.
当时，除首尔外，大部分地区可使用的负压床位已不足30张。
At the time, less than 30 negative-pressure beds were available in most areas except Seoul.
“负压病房”指的是病房内气压低于病房外气压的病房，可以预防病房内被患者污染过的空气泄漏出去，适用于隔离治疗新冠肺炎等呼吸道传染性疾病患者。
"Negative pressure ward" refers to the ward pressure lower than the air pressure outside the ward, can prevent the patient-contaminated air leakage out of the ward, is suitable for isolation treatment of patients with respiratory infectious diseases such as New Crown Pneumonia.
在2015年中东呼吸综合征（MERS）疫情爆发时，韩国政府所指定的医疗机构负压病房共有100多张床位，是如今的十分之一。
At the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in 2015, the government's designated negative-pressure wards had more than 100 beds, one-tenth the number today.
然而面对来势汹汹的新冠疫情，1000多张负压病床显然仍不足以容纳成千上万名确诊与疑似病例。
Yet in the face of a new, menacing outbreak, it is clear that more than 1,000 negative-pressure beds are still insufficient to accommodate thousands of confirmed and suspected cases.
普通隔离病房床位同样缺乏。
There is also a shortage of beds in general isolation wards.
根据经济合作与发展组织（OECD）的统计，韩国在每千人病床数方面其实处于领先位置。
According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), South Korea is actually the leading country in terms of beds per 1,000 people.
2017年，韩国每千人病床数为12.3张，仅次于日本的13.1张，是德国的1.5倍，法国的2倍，意大利和美国（数据为2016年）的4倍。
In 2017, the number of beds per 1,000 people in Korea was 12.3, behind 13.1 in Japan, 1.5 times that of Germany, 2 times that of France and 4 times that of Italy and the United States (data for 2016).
根据国家卫健委去年5月发布的卫生健康事业发展统计公报，中国每千人口医疗卫生机构床位数2017年为5.72张，2018年为6.03张。
According to the statistical bulletin on the development of health services issued by the National Health Commission in May last year, the number of beds per 1,000 population in China was 5.72 in 2017 and 6.03 in 2018.
来源：OECD但随着韩国接受检测的人数突破十万，在疫情“重灾区”大邱和庆北，医疗机构的病床已经无力接收疑似病例，就连确诊患者也“一床难求”。
Source: OECD but with more than 100,000 people tested in South Korea, hospital beds in Daegu and Gyeongbei, hard-hit areas, are no longer able to take in suspected cases, and even confirmed cases are "hard to find."
“至暗时刻”出现在3月初。
The "dark hour" appeared in early March.
由于严重缺乏负压及普通隔离病房床位，大邱确诊患者三人中，就有两人被迫居家隔离，虽然政府也在筹措床位，但当时，新增确诊病例已是新增床位的三倍之多。
Two out of three patients diagnosed in Daegu were forced to stay at home because of a severe shortage of negative pressure and beds in the general isolation ward. Although the Government was also raising beds, three times as many new cases had been diagnosed at that time.
此前，因床位不足、在等待入院期间去世的病例已开始陆续出现。
Previously, cases of death pending admission due to lack of beds had begun to appear.
2月25日至28日，大邱已至少有三人在居家隔离期间突发呼吸困难，在送院后不治身亡。
Between 25 and 28 February, at least three people in Daegu died of respiratory distress after being hospitalized after experiencing acute respiratory difficulties while in isolation.
为缓解“病床荒”，韩国政府随后调整了收治策略，改为“分级诊疗”。
To alleviate the "shortage of beds," the South Korean government subsequently adjusted its admission strategy to "graded treatment."
根据中央灾难安全对策本部1日发布的新版治疗管理方案，患者将根据病情轻重，被分为轻症、中症、重症、最重症患者，中症以上患者将被迅速安排在负压病房或是国家定点医院接受治疗，轻症患者则以一人一间的方式入住设于公营设施等地的“生活治疗中心”。
According to the new treatment management plan issued by the Central Committee for Disaster Safety and Management on the 1st day, patients will be classified as mild, moderate, severe and the most serious according to the severity of their illness. Patients with severe illnesses will be treated promptly in negative pressure wards or state designated hospitals.
这一治疗管理方案主要基于新冠肺炎疫情的特点，即80%至85%的患者都是轻症。
The treatment management programme is based on the characteristics of the new crown pneumonia epidemic, with 80 to 85 per cent of patients suffering from mild illness.
根据中国疾控中心2月17日发布的新冠肺炎流行病学特征分析，大多数新冠肺炎患者表现为轻症，轻、中症病例达到80.9%，13.8%为重症，病死率较高的危重病例则占5%。
According to the epidemiological profile of New Crown Pneumonia released by the China CDC on February 17, the majority of patients with new crown pneumonia showed mild cases, with 80.9% of cases of mild or moderate illness, 13.8% of cases of severe illness, and 5% of cases of severe disease with a high mortality rate.
在这样的条件下，韩国决定不安排所有患者住院治疗，而是集中治疗有生命危险的重症患者。
Under these conditions, South Korea decided not to hospitalize all patients, but to concentrate on life-threatening and serious cases.
轻症者入住的“生活治疗中心”也配有医疗人员，这些中心由地方政府各自指定，周边医疗机构提供医疗支援。
There are also medical staff attached to the "Life Therapy Centres" for light patients, which are designated by the respective local governments with medical support provided by the surrounding medical institutions.
根据医疗人员的判断，轻症患者可随时转入医院接受治疗，中症以上患者若好转出院，也可转入治疗中心或是居家疗养。
According to the judgement of the medical staff, patients with mild illness can be transferred to hospital for treatment at any time. Patients with moderate or above symptoms can also be transferred to treatment centres or convalescent homes.
据了解，这些中心多数是由现有设施改建的，比如研修院、国营和民营企业的员工宿舍等。
It is understood that most of these centres have been converted from existing facilities, such as institutes, staff dormitories in State and private enterprises, etc.
三星生命保险、LG Display等企业均提供了一些设施，政府会承担这些设施除租金以外的人力和水电支出。
Samsung Life Insurance, LG Display and other businesses offer a number of facilities for which the government will bear the cost of manpower and utilities in addition to rent.
这种分级诊疗的“双轨”措施很快取得了成效。
This "two-track" approach to tiered care quickly paid off.
据《华尔街日报》22日报道，截至3月8日，大邱仍有超过2200名确诊患者在等待床位，占确诊病例总数的约40%，两周后，这一数字已降至124人，而且均为轻症或无症状患者。
As of March 8, more than 2,200 patients were waiting for beds in Daegu, about 40 percent of the total number of confirmed cases. Two weeks later, the number had fallen to 124, all of them mild or asymptomatic, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday.
韩国的“分级诊疗”策略其实与中国“应收尽收、应治尽治”的思路一致。
South Korea's "graded diagnosis and treatment" strategy is in fact consistent with China's "receivable, should cure all" mentality.
在疫情爆发初期，武汉也曾出现“一床难求”的情况，在火神山、雷神山医院建成后，床位依然吃紧，直至多座“方舱医院”投入使用，局面才得以缓解。
In the early stage of the outbreak, Wuhan also appeared "a bed difficult to ask" situation, after the completion of the Mount Fire, Lei Shenshan Hospital, beds remain tight, until a number of "square cabin hospitals" were put into use.
武汉所有方舱医院如今均已休舱。
All of Wuhan's square cabin hospitals are now closed.
据新华社报道，武汉共建成14家方舱医院，实际开放床位1.3万多张，累计收治患者1.2万余人，武汉每4名新冠肺炎患者中，就有1人在方舱医院治疗。
According to Xinhua News Agency, 14 Fang Cao hospitals have been built in Wuhan, with more than 13,000 beds opened, receiving 12,000 patients and treating one in every four patients in Wuhan.
首尔一家医院推出的“手套墙”采样装置。

而在“分级诊疗”以外，韩国同时还采取了“远程医疗”、“手套墙”等新颖手段。
Besides "graded diagnosis and treatment," South Korea also adopted "telemedicine," "glove wall" and other innovative means.
从原则上讲，远程医疗在韩国是被禁止的。
In principle, telemedicine is banned in Korea.
但随着确诊病例数的急剧增长，自2月24日起，韩国保健福祉部已放宽了限制，暂时允许医疗机构提供电话咨询和用药建议。
However, with the sharp increase in the number of confirmed cases, the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare has relaxed restrictions since 24 February, temporarily allowing medical institutions to provide telephone counselling and medication advice.
“手套墙”则是首尔一家医院推出的采样装置，由透明的亚克力墙和医用手套组成，医生无需穿防护服就能完成采样。
The glove wall, a sampling device introduced at a Seoul hospital, consists of transparent acrylic walls and medical gloves that doctors can sample without wearing protective clothing.
据韩国《亚洲经济》16日报道，这一装置现已被推广到首尔的其他医院。
The device has now been extended to other hospitals in Seoul, the newspaper reported Monday.
与此同时，韩国也正在加紧筹备负压病房，扩充人力救治重症病例。
At the same time, South Korea is stepping up preparations for negative pressure wards and expanding manpower to treat serious cases.
韩国可隆集团（KOLON）11日已表示，将斥资25亿韩元（约合人民币1400万元）向位于庆北的首尔大学医院闻庆分院捐建24个床位的集装箱式负压病房。
South Korea's KOLON group said Tuesday it would spend 2.5 billion won (14 million yuan) on a 24-bed container negative-pressure ward at Seoul University Hospital in Seoul, Gyeongbei province.
中国的远大科技集团也与该院签订了合同，首期24个床位的负压隔离病房已在21日发货，第二期和第三期共计500个床位的病房也在紧张生产中，将在后续被送到首尔、釜山等城市。
China's big technology group has also signed a contract with the hospital, the first 24-bed negative pressure isolation ward has been delivered on the 21st day, and the second and third phase of 500-bed wards are also in intensive production and will be sent to Seoul, Busan and other cities.
