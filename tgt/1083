在 2 月 15 日世界穿山甲日来临之际，我们制作了这期特别节目，来跟你说说穿山甲的真实处境。
On Feb. 15, World Pangolin Day, we produced this special program to tell you about the real situation of pangolin.
今天故事的讲述者徐佳鸣是一个生活在广州的记者，他曾经在南都周刊等媒体工作过。
The narrator of today's story, Xu Jiaoming, a journalist living in Guangzhou, has worked in the media such as Nandu Weekly.
2019 年，他加入全球环境报道联盟，与来自亚洲和非洲的三十多个记者一道，深入调查了穿山甲的非法贸易链。
In 2019, he joined the Global Environmental Reporting Alliance and, together with more than 30 journalists from Asia and Africa, conducted an in-depth investigation into the illicit trade chain of pangolins.
■野生动物专家估计，十分之九的穿山甲走私并未被发现。
▪ Wildlife experts estimate that nine out of ten pangolin smugglers go undetected.
图片/蔡耀徵，台湾报道者-1-「通乳」的穿山甲我是北方人，我在北方生活的时候从没听说有谁要吃穿山甲，或者说大家完全没有这方面的知识。
Photo / Tsai Yiu-chi, Taiwan reporter-1-breast pangolin I am a northerner and I never heard of anyone eating pangolin while living in the north.
我现在已经在广州生活六年了，我听说广东这边有一些吃野味的习俗，穿山甲就是其中的一个野味。
I have been living in Guangzhou for six years now. I hear that there are some customs of eating game on this side of Guangdong Province.
我想应该有一些人可能还是会相信吃穿山甲是有好处的，认为它可以治某些病。
I think some people may still believe in the benefits of eating pangolin, and think it can cure some diseases.
大家都会用一个词——它很「补」。
Everyone uses one word - it's "tonic."
中医认为，穿山甲有挖掘或者掘地的习惯，以形补形，所以穿山甲就有帮人疏通或打通的功效。
According to TCM, pangolin has the habit of digging or digging the ground to form a complement, so pangolin has the effect of helping people to dredge or open.
比如说，穿山甲在中药里面的一个药用就是「通乳」。
For example, pangolin in Chinese medicine in a medicinal is "lactation."
妈妈生了小孩之后如果没有足够的奶水，很多人相信穿山甲和猪脚之类的一起煲可以通乳。
When a mother has a baby and doesn't have enough milk, many people believe pangolins and pigs can be cooked together.
这个中医的理论有特别大的争议。
The theory of TCM is particularly controversial.
很多专家和动物保护机构都出来向公众做过科普，指出穿山甲的鳞片结构主要是蛋白质，它和人类的指甲、毛发的组织是一样的，并没有什么神效。
Many experts and animal protection agencies have come out to the public and point out that pangolin scales are mainly made of proteins that are the same tissue as human fingernails and hair and have no magic effect.
我在饭桌上听人提起，有人很喜欢吃穿山甲。
I have been told at the dinner table that some people like to eat pangolin.
我想这种心理也就是有面子，好炫耀，展示我吃到一个很贵、很稀罕的东西而已。
I think this kind of psychology also has the face, easy to show off, shows me to eat a very expensive, very rare thing.
-2-广州动物园的救护经历在 6 月份开会之前，我在广州做了一些采访。
-2-Guangzhou Zoo Ambulance Experience Before the June meeting, I did some interviews in Guangzhou.
在中国做穿山甲保护，大家都绕不开一个 NGO——中国生物多样性保护与绿色发展基金会（简称中国绿发会）。
The China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation, a non-governmental organization working in China to protect pangolins, won't make it around.
中国绿发会是野保和动保领域很重要的一个 NGO，有很强的半官方背景，所以他们比较敢做。
The Green Hair Council is an important NGO in the fields of Nombo and WSPA, with a strong parastatal background, so they are more daring to do so.
在野保领域，穿山甲保护也是他们很重要的一个项目。
Pangolin conservation is also an important part of their field.
当时我跟他们接触，知道他们在广州刚好有救护行动。
I had contact with them and knew that they had a rescue operation in Guangzhou.
广州海关罚没了一些穿山甲，他们正在尝试去救护、去野放。
Guangzhou Customs confiscated some pangolin, they are trying to rescue, go wild.
这也是他们第一次尝试野放，最后并没有成功。
It was the first time they had tried wild, but it didn't work.
去年 4 月底左右，我在广州、清远前后一共见了 3 次穿山甲。
At the end of last April, I saw three pangolins around Guangzhou and Qingyuan.
因为穿山甲是被解救出来的，当我见到这几只穿山甲的时候，它们是奄奄一息的，那个状态是很可怜。
Because pangolin is rescued, when I see these pangolin, they are on the verge of death, that state is very poor.
我白天的时候去看，他们是不会动的，基本上就蜷缩在角落里面，看起来也很脏，身上有泥巴，又不活泼。
When I see them during the day, they don't move, they basically curl up in the corner, they look dirty, muddy and inert.
■穿山甲被送回广东省林业局下属救护中心前留下眼泪。
▪ Pangolin was sent back to the Guangdong Forestry Administration Medical Center before leaving tears.
图片/张思远，中国生物多样性保护与绿色发展基金会绿发会做穿山甲专项的工作人员 Sophia 被媒体称作「穿山甲女孩」，她一个人从北京来到广州。
Photo / Zhang Siyuan, a pangolin worker at the Green Development Foundation for Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development in China, Sophia, who was called a pangolin girl by the media, came to Guangzhou from Beijing alone.
Sophia要自己给穿山甲做饭，买鸡蛋来煮，再把蛋黄打出来，还要请云南的志愿者给她寄一些蚂蚁。
Sophia would cook pangolin herself, buy eggs for cooking, beat out the yolks, and ask volunteers in Yunnan to send her some ants.
我们会帮她去挑那些已经冻成冰疙瘩的蚂蚁。
We'll help her pick out ants that have frozen to ice.
从动物园的冰箱拿出来后，要把里面的树枝、塑料都拣出来，然后把蚂蚁挑出来，和鸡蛋那些打在一起，打成糊，就好像一碗芝麻糊一样，给穿山甲吃。
After taking it out of the zoo's fridge, pick out the branches and the plastic, and then pick out the ants and beat them with the eggs, batting them into paste, like a bowl of sesame paste, to feed the pangolins.
穿山甲基本上是只吃蚂蚁的，而且有很多穿山甲只吃白蚁，而白蚁就更难找了。
Pangolins are basically ants-only, and there are many pangolins that eat only termites, and termites are more difficult to find.
所以养穿山甲是很难，而且很贵的。
So raising pangolin is very difficult and expensive.
要找到满足穿山甲食量的蚂蚁很不容易，因为一只健康的穿山甲至少可以吃一亩山的白蚁这样的害虫，它在生态系统中，也有自己的价值。
Finding ants to feed on pangolin is not easy, because a healthy pangolin can eat at least an acre of termite pests, and it has its own value in the ecosystem.
跟人类一样，穿山甲一年只生一胎，也很胆小。
Like humans, pangolins have only one child a year and are timid.
所以穿山甲就是一个非常典型的濒危野生动物，而且它还是哺乳动物，有感情，会流眼泪。
So pangolin is a very typical endangered wildlife, and it is also a mammal, emotional, will shed tears.
对我来说，其实更深的一个印象是我们救护的条件很一般。
To me, actually a deeper impression is that the conditions of our rescue are mediocre.
广州动物园已经是华南地区比较好的动物园了，但是我们也没有专门收留穿山甲的场所，而是把它放在养蜥蜴的房间。
Guangzhou Zoo is already a good zoo in southern China, but we do not have a special place to house pangolin, but put it in the lizard room.
因为蜥蜴喜欢那种陈腐、阴暗的环境，所以整一排的笼舍也比较臭。
Because lizards like the hackneyed, dark environment, whole rows of cages stink.
后来得知园方也做了些改造的工作，以后可能还会打交道我们第二天去的时候，就发现穿山甲身上有蜱虫，因为会被蜱虫咬，工作人员就需要帮它除虫。
When we went the next day, we discovered that there were ticks in the pangolin, and because they were bitten by ticks, the staff had to help them get rid of them.
他们用药水喷到穿山甲的身上，蜱虫才会掉，喷的过程中穿山甲就会抖，发出啜泣的声音，给人感觉很可怜。
When they sprayed water on the pangolin, the ticks would drop, the pangolin would shake and sob, making it feel pitiful.
-3-中国是穿山甲消费国2014 年 7 月，由伦敦动物学会主持的 IUCN 红色名录物种存续委员会穿山甲专门小组，把中华穿山甲及马来穿山甲的保护级别提升至「极危」。
- 3- China is a pangolin consumer country. In July 2014, the IUCN Red List of Species Survival Commission Pangolin Panel, chaired by the Zoological Society of London, raised the level of protection for Chinese pangolins and Malay pangolins to extremely high risk.
全部 8 个物种均面临绝种威胁。
All eight species are threatened with extinction.
而且他们发出警告，说穿山甲是目前全世界最常被走私买卖的哺乳类动物。
And they warn that pangolins are by far the most commonly smuggled mammals in the world.
经过一些基本的研究，我们发现那些穿山甲的走私买卖最后都流向了中国，中国是一个绝对的穿山甲消费国。
After some basic research, we found that the smuggling of those pangolin end up in China, China is an absolute pangolin consumer.
越南的买卖量仅次于中国，但很多穿山甲即使到了越南，最终也是为了转运到中国。
Vietnamese sales are second only to that of China, but many pangolins, even when they arrive in Vietnam, end up being shipped to China.
■横跨亚非的走私路线图，据信，穿山甲的需求主要来自中国。
▪ A smuggling route across Asia and Africa, where pangolin demand is believed to come mainly from China.
数据：尼泊尔时报-4-初见各国记者做完基本的研究，写了一个国别报告之后，在6月初我和全球环境报道联盟的所有记者见了一个面，商讨下面的调查方向。
Data: The Nepal Times-4 - After seeing journalists from around the world do basic research and write a country report, I met with all journalists from the Global Environmental Reporting Alliance in early June to discuss the direction of the investigation.
我们做新闻行业的感受，是中国记者和外国记者之间的这种跨国合作挺不容易的。
The way we feel about the news industry is that this kind of international cooperation between Chinese and foreign journalists is not easy.
外国记者对中国都会有一些误解或者偏见之类的东西。
Foreign journalists have a certain amount of misunderstanding or prejudice about China.
他们好像觉得中国采访会很难，有一些数据会很难拿到，会很可怕。
They seem to think it will be difficult to interview in China, and some of the data will be hard to get. It will be terrible.
其实也没有那么糟糕，中国有一个很公开的法庭的数据，其实很多国家是没有的。
Nor is it so bad that China has a very open court data, which many countries do not have.
那次会议上，大家确定最终要出一个穿山甲走私贸易的全球报告，基本上是每个记者负责在自己的国家去调查。
At that meeting, it was decided that a global report would eventually be produced on the pangolin smuggling trade, with each journalist basically responsible for the investigation in his or her own country.
不过最后，所有的记者都把期待投向了我，因为大家知道穿山甲的流向最终是中国，大家希望我能解释中国消费穿山甲的实际情况到底是什么样的。
But in the end, all the reporters turned to me, knowing that the pangolin was going eventually to China, and everyone wanted me to explain what it really was like to consume pangolin in China.
■香港海关缉获的用锡箔纸包裹的 110 公斤穿山甲鳞片，两名广西女子试图从香港走私到澳门。
:: 110 kg of tin-foil-wrapped pangolin scales seized by the Customs and Excise Department, with two Guangxi women attempting to smuggle it from Hong Kong to Macao.
图片/香港海关-5-中国市场的「吃」和「药用」我要解答的主要问题：中国到底是怎么用穿山甲？中国人到底是不是那么爱吃？中国的药厂是不是那么疯狂？中国实际情况是怎么样的？所以我主要去解答「吃」和「药用」这两个方面。
Photo / C-5 - "Eating" and "Medicinal" Questions in the Chinese Market: How do Chinese people eat pangolins? Are Chinese people so fond of pangolins? Are Chinese pharmaceutical manufacturers so crazy? What is the actual situation in China? So I will mainly answer the questions of "eat" and "medicinally."
就在开会之后，我和一些做野保的志愿者一起在广州附近去做食用的调查。
Just after the meeting, I joined a group of Nombo volunteers to do a food survey near Guangzhou.
那些志愿者是非常有经验的中年人，很会和贩子打交道。
The volunteers were middle-aged, very experienced people who dealt well with traffickers.
但即使和他们配合，我们也发现即便在广州这样一个很喜欢吃野味的地方，穿山甲已经不是那么容易吃到了。
But even with their cooperation, we found that even in a place like Guangzhou, where people love to eat wild food, pangolin is not so easy to eat.
因为这很明确是违法的行为，如果被举报警察是真的会来抓你的。
Because it's clear that it's illegal, and if the police report it, they'll actually come after you.
当然，也跟这两年反腐的大背景有关系。
Of course, it has to do with the broader context of anti-corruption in these two years.
因为穿山甲非常贵，基本上就是当官的和有钱人在吃的，吃一次穿山甲大概要一万元左右。
Because pangolin is very expensive, basically is the official and rich people are eating, eat pangolin once about 10,000 yuan.
所以这两年吃的情况还是有的，但是比之前会少很多，市场也小很多。
So the situation of eating in these two years is still some, but will be much less than before, the market is much smaller.
然后，我们就要去回答「药用」的部分。
Then we will answer the "Medicinal" part.
中国到底用了多少穿山甲在药上面？其实中国关于穿山甲最大的一个法律漏洞，就是中药。
How much pangolin does China use on medicine? In fact, the biggest legal loophole in Chinese pangolin is Chinese traditional medicine.
穿山甲的入药在中国是合法的。
The use of pangolin as a medicine is legal in China.
我们国家遵守国际条约，对于穿山甲不能贸易、不能把它烹饪、卖钱，这些都是不行的。
Our country abides by international treaties and cannot trade, cook or sell pangolin.
但是穿山甲的药用是合法，中国有大概六、七十种药是要用到穿山甲的。
But pangolin is legal to use medicinally. There are about 60 or 70 kinds of Chinese medicine used in pangolin.
在中国，买到合法药用的穿山甲鳞片是很容易的。
In China, it is easy to buy pangolin scales for legal use.
我们在广州、佛山、汕头、广西、南宁等几个城市，都可以找到药店，买到合法的穿山甲鳞片。
In Guangzhou, Foshan, Shantou, Guangxi, Nanning and other cities, we can find pharmacies and buy legitimate pangolin scales.
它的价格大概在 7 块钱到 10 块钱一克，是一个比较贵的中药了。
It costs about $7 to $10 a gram and is a more expensive Chinese medicine.
其实在 2015 年之前，我们国家林业系统有这样一个说法，说中国有一个库存系统，我们所有合法用的穿山甲批文，都是来自于库存系统，一年的量大概是 25 吨左右，这个量应该是远远不够中国市场的需求的。
In fact, until 2015, our national forestry system has said that China has an inventory system, all our legal use of pangolin approval, are from the inventory system, the volume of a year is about 25 tons, which should be far from the Chinese market demand.
因为中国会经常发现十几吨的走私案例。
Because China will often find dozens of tons of smuggling cases.
一方面走私需求那么大，但一方面每年只批 25 吨，而且 2015 年之后数据不公开。
On the one hand, the demand for smuggling is such that, on the one hand, only 25 tons are shipped per year and the data are not publicly available after 2015.
这也是中国绿发会一直在打的一个点，要求政府信息公开。
It is also a point that China Green Development Council has been fighting to make government information public.
他们公开地去写诉状或者是写申请报告，但都没有得到答复。
They wrote public petitions or application reports, but received no reply.
所以这是一个非常大的漏洞。
So this is a very big loophole.
■汕头一家药店贩卖无合法标签的穿山甲鳞片，价格是6元人民币每克，销售人员称穿山甲鳞片利于通乳。
▪ Shantou drugstore sells pangolin scales without legal labels, the price is 6 yuan per gram, sales staff said pangolin scales conducive to milk.
图片/全球环境报道联盟所以中国有库存，但我们的库存量多少是不公开的，这里面就有两个问题：1. 我们罚没和查获的东西是不是会流入合法市场？2. 合法市场的量和它的普遍程度到底是怎么样的？先回答了第二个问题，就是中国的药厂的情况大概怎么样。
Photo / Global Environmental Report Coalition So China has stocks, but how much of it is not publicly available, and there are two questions in it: 1. Will what we confiscate and seize flow into the legitimate market? 2) How about the volume of the legal market and its prevalence?
这方面，中国绿发会有一个比较好的报告，在前两年他们有一个中国合法使用的国药准字中有穿山甲成分的名单。
In this regard, China Green Development Council has a better report, in the previous two years they have a Chinese legal use of the Chinese Chinese medicine criteria have a list of ingredients Pangolin.
查这个应该是不难的，甚至销量，公众都应该可以查询到。
This should not be difficult to look up, or even sales, the public should be able to find out.
但是我用了挺多数据库，没有查到 2019 年穿山甲的数据情况，所以只能依靠 2016 年的表格。
But I used a lot of databases, not 2019 pangolin data, so I had to rely on the 2016 table.
我们对了一下，表格里面多数药还是存在的。
We got it right. Most of the drugs in the form still exist.
这其中大概有两、三家药厂是在广东的，所以我们就去了这几家工厂。
About two or three of these plants are in Guangdong, so we went to these factories.
很幸运，我们在其中一家工厂碰到了采购的主管之一。
Luckily, we ran into one of the chief purchasing officers at one of the factories.
他非常信任我们，给我们看了他手里一个来自天津的批文，一个广东的工厂用的是天津的批文，用量是 800 公斤。
He trusted us so much that he showed us an approval from Tianjin. A factory in Guangdong used a Tianjin license and used 800 kg.
他告诉我，这个量是很小的。
He told me that the amount was small.
因为它也不是什么特别大的厂，这样的厂一个月左右就会用到 800 公斤的话，我们 25 吨的量是经不起推敲的。
Because it is not a very large factory, such a factory in a month or so will use 800 kg, we can not withstand 25 tons of volume.
我们通过采访和暗访得到的一个线索，也许可以回答中国在「药用」这一块可能是存在比较明显的值得去监督的地方。
A clue we get from interviews and unannounced visits may answer that China's "medicinal" presence may be a more obvious place to be monitored.
-6-缅甸调查因为中国本土的中华穿山甲濒临灭绝，已经很难觅到踪影，所以现在在中国能买到的穿山甲和鳞片一般是从东南亚或者非洲走私过来的。
-6-Burma Survey Because China's mainland pangolin is endangered and hard to find, the pangolins and scales now available in China are generally smuggled from Southeast Asia or Africa.
根据这次我们非洲记者的调查发现，来自中国的购买者已经深入到非洲的村子里去直接收购穿山甲了。
According to our survey of African journalists, buyers from China have gone deep into African villages to buy pangolins directly.
在这次的调查过程中，除了国内，我还在当地记者的配合下，暗访了越南和缅甸的交易链条。
In this investigation, in addition to the domestic, I also with the cooperation of local journalists, unannounced visits to Vietnam and Myanmar trading chain.
其中缅甸的见闻最让我印象深刻。
Of these, I was most impressed by what I saw in Myanmar.
■在记者的秘密调查中，从网络野生动物贩子那里救出了穿山甲。
▪ Pangolin was rescued from online wildlife dealers in a covert investigation by journalists.
穿山甲后来由马来西亚野生动物部和国家公园半岛释放到丛林中。
The pangolin was later released into the jungle by the Malaysian Wildlife Service and the National Park Peninsula.
图片/全球环境报道联盟缅甸的行程是去年 11 月 14 日到 12 月 12 日。
Photo / Global Environmental Reporting Alliance Myanmar trip from November 14 to December 12 last year.
缅甸人对中国人的印象不太好，因为他们觉得中国是一个拿走缅甸资源的国家。
Burmese people have a bad impression of the Chinese because they feel that China is a country that has taken away Myanmar's resources.
中国是向他们索取很多的一个国家，虽然中国也付钱，但这些钱不一定会受益到每个普通人。
China is a country that demands a lot from them, and although China pays, the money does not necessarily benefit everyone.
因为缅甸是军政府，很多地方还是不透明、不公开，所以普通人或者我接触到的一些人，他们会对中国人会有这样的想法。
Because Burma is a military junta and much of it remains opaque and undisclosed, ordinary people, or people I come into contact with, will think that way about the Chinese.
在缅甸，我一开始采访就是通过打入华人圈子的形式来做。
In Myanmar, I started my interview by breaking into the Chinese community.
我就见到这样一个中国律师。
I met such a Chinese lawyer.
他很谨慎，也谈了很多。
He was careful and talked a lot.
他透露了一个信息，其实在缅甸吃穿山甲是非常容易的，有一个饭店，他们圈子的中国人都知道。
He revealed a message that pangolin is actually very easy to eat in Myanmar, there is a restaurant, their circle of Chinese people know.
我知道了这个线索之后，就去了那个饭店。
I found the clue and went to the restaurant.
去到之后，就进入了一个做灰色生意的中国人的世界。
After going there, he entered a world of Chinese people in the gray business.
饭店的感觉就和一个北京的饭店一模一样，每个人都喝得醉醺醺的，全是白酒味道。
The hotel felt exactly like a Beijing hotel, everyone was drunk and it tasted like white wine.
各种南方、北方的方言，大家在吹牛、在扯淡、在谈女人、在说自己赚了多少钱、在诉苦…… 他们都非常放得开，声音很大，就和中国任何一个饭店一样。
All the dialects of the South and the North are bragging, talking nonsense, talking about women, talking about how much money they have made and what they are complaining about... they are all very relaxed and vocal, just like any restaurant in China.
■徐佳鸣在仰光的饭店中，看到了穿山甲然后我们点了一些正常的菜，跟老板聊了一下，说我们想吃穿山甲，想招待人。
Xu Jiaming saw pangolin in a restaurant in Yangon and then we ordered some normal food and talked to our boss about our desire to eat pangolin and entertain.
老板当场就答应说，不用预定，他们做这个已经做了十多年，非常自信。
The boss said on the spot, do not book, they have been doing this for more than 10 years, very confident.
这跟我们在中国和越南看到的情况不一样。
This is different from what we see in China and Vietnam.
在中国，老板非常谨慎，你需要三、四次去吃饭，他才有可能给你一点点信息，才可能去相信你。
In China, the boss is very cautious, you need to eat three or four times, he is likely to give you a little information, may be able to trust you.
在越南也是，你要提前一星期去预定。
In Vietnam, too. You have to book a week in advance.
吃完饭结账之后，我跟老板说，我想看一下才放心。
After I finished my meal, I told my boss I wanted to check it out.
他很随便地叫了一个厨师带我去后厨，拎了一只穿山甲出来。
He casually called a cook to take me to the back kitchen and brought out a pangolin.
我已经半年没有见到活的穿山甲，这次见到的穿山甲看起来非常可怜，蜷缩在地上，我拍了几张照片。
I had not seen live pangolin for half a year. The pangolin I saw this time looked very poor, curled up on the ground, I took a few photos.
这个饭店的对面是一个特产店，它里面也在卖穿山甲的鳞片和穿山甲粉。
Opposite the hotel is a specialty store, which also sells pangolin scales and pangolin powder.
价格也不低，大概一公斤可能要 3000 元人民币以上。
The price is not low either. It may cost more than RMB3000 per kilogram.
老板还不建议我们买甲片，说「你带不过去，很危险」。
The boss also advised us not to buy nail clips, saying, "You can't take them. It's dangerous."
然后我就顺水推舟问他，「你能不能帮我送」，但这个老板他却说带不了。
Then I pushed the boat and asked him, "Can you give it to me," but the boss said he couldn't.
这样看来，在仰光吃穿山甲非常容易，买到也很容易，运送可能有点难。
So pangolin in Yangon is easy to eat, easy to buy, and a bit difficult to transport.
■2019年6月，菲律宾当局在大雅台市（ Tagaytay City）查获了10隻穿山甲，3名男子被捕。
▪ In June 2019, Philippine authorities seized 10 pangolins in the city of Tagaytay City, where three men were arrested.

大其力臭名昭著，是金三角的中心。
It is notorious as the center of the Golden Triangle.
毒枭坤沙 90 年代就生活在这个城市，相当于是他的大本营。
Drug kingfisher has lived in the city since the 90s, making it his stronghold.
现在那边也有很多中国人，因为附近有金矿。
There are many Chinese there now, too, because there are gold mines nearby.
我来到这里之后，又见到了穿山甲。
After I came here, I saw the pangolin again.
因为当地有华人，有中国人吃就会有人卖。
Because there are Chinese people in the area, people will sell them if they have Chinese to eat.
我很轻松地就打听到，早市大概 8 点或 9 点之前，去到市场就可以见到卖家。
It was easy for me to find out that the seller was to be found in the market before about 8 or 9 a.m.
然后我就去了，见到一个缅甸大姐在路边卖穿山甲。
Then I went to see a Myanmar elder sister selling pangolins by the side of the road.
因为她身上绑了一只猴子，非常的显眼，旁边摊位上放的可能是老虎或者豹子下颚的牙，鸟笼里面有一些猛禽，还有一些昆虫也都在卖。
Because she tied a monkey, very conspicuous, next to the booth may be tiger or leopard jaws teeth, bird cage there are some birds of prey, and some insects are also sold.
我用缅甸语「穿山甲」询问，缅甸大姐听懂了。
I asked in Burmese "pangolin" and the Myanmar elder sister understood.
她打了一个电话，她老公就把一只穿山甲拿了过来。
She made a phone call and her husband brought over a pangolin.
这只穿山甲让我印象非常深刻，它是我见过身体最好、最活泼、最健壮的一只穿山甲。
This pangolin impressed me very much. It was the best, most vivacious and robust pangolin I had ever seen.
他们把它丢到框子里后，穿山甲立刻翻越框子，要逃跑，速度非常快，吓得缅甸大姐养的那只猴子都在叫。
They threw it into the box, and immediately the pangolin jumped over the frame and tried to escape so fast that the monkey that belonged to the eldest sister of Myanmar was screaming.
原来健康的穿山甲，它的爬行速度是这么快的！但是穿山甲确实很容易被人类降服，缅甸大姐很有经验，抓起那只穿山甲的尾巴，拍拍它，它就怕得缩起来了。
Originally healthy pangolin, it crawls so fast! But the pangolin is easy to human surrender, Myanmar elder sister is very experienced, grab the pangolin tail, pat it, it is afraid to shrink.
Play■商贩拍拍穿山甲，把它举起来，然后又塞回尼龙袋里我是以买家身份去问的，这只穿山甲的价格大概在三、四千人民币左右。
Play: The dealer pats the pangolin, lifts it up, then pushes it back into the nylon bag. I'm asking as a buyer. The price of the pangolin is about 3,000 or 4,000 yuan.
采访结束之后，我难受了好一阵。
After the interview, I had a rough time.
因为我见到了各种形态的穿山甲，健康的、脆弱的、死掉的，它们要被中国人吃，我又是以中国人的身份去买，开的饭店也是服务中国人，感觉很复杂。
Because I saw the various forms of pangolin, healthy, fragile, dead, they are to be eaten by the Chinese, I also as a Chinese to buy, the hotel is also serving the Chinese people, it feels very complicated.
看到穿山甲和我们中国人的联系，我自己作为一个中国人，心情还是有点不太舒服。
Seeing the connection between pangolin and our Chinese, I feel a little uncomfortable as a Chinese.
-8-非法贸易现状关于运送到中国的方式，我们在当地问了两个做物流的人，他们大概提供了两种方法。
- 8 - Illegal Trade Situation With regard to the mode of transportation to China, we asked two logistics operators locally, who probably offered two methods.
第一种是最简单的，中国在边境地区都有一个「边民互贸」的政策，当地人持相关证件，每天是可以带一些东西跨境交易的。
The first is simple: China has a "border trade" policy in the border areas, where local people hold relevant documents and can bring something across the border every day.
通过「蚂蚁搬家」的形式，请当地人帮你一点一点地帮你带，可能量会比较小，但是风险最低。
Ask the local people to help you with it little by little. It may be smaller, but it's the least risky.
还有一种方法，就是通过当地的物流公司运输。
There is also a way to transport through local logistics companies.
因为集装箱车或者货车都是很大的，他可以把穿山甲的鳞片混在成吨的物品里面，这样混过去。
Because the container or truck was large, he could mix the scales of the pangolin into tons of stuff to get through.
同样相当于是「蚂蚁搬家」，把大的货化整为零带到中国。
It's also the equivalent of "ant moving," bringing big goods into small pieces and bringing them to China.
他们每个人都知道走私穿山甲是违法的，但是每个人都在做，而且每个人都很轻松的告诉我「这事能做，你可以放心」。
Everyone knew it was illegal to smuggle pangolins, but everyone was doing it and everyone was comfortable telling me, "You can rest assured."
■站在越南芒街，仅一河之隔可以看到它的姊妹城市中国广西东兴，记者在这里暗访发现包括穿山甲在内的地下走私仍然活跃。
Standing in Mangjie, Vietnam, just across a river to see its sister city of Guangxi Dongxing, China, reporters unannounced that smuggling, including pangolin, remains active.
图片/全球环境报道联盟我们的编辑问过一个问题：既然缅甸的本地人没有消费穿山甲的习惯，主要都是卖给了中国人，而且在缅甸买卖穿山甲也是非法的，那为什么缅甸没有控制住穿山甲的交易呢？我们的缅甸记者举了一个例子，她有一个专门做反大象盗猎的摄影师朋友告诉她，在那些边境山区，缅甸警察的枪比盗猎者的枪还差，警察见到盗猎者是要跑的，因为盗猎者的枪更好，人更多。
Photo / Global Environment Report Coalition Our editor asked a question: Since native Burmese people do not consume pangolin and are mainly sold to Chinese, and buying and selling pangolin in Burma is illegal, why does Myanmar not control the pangolin trade?
我去过两次缅甸，我同样感觉到，缅甸因为种族问题、经济发展问题等原因，可能也的确没有这样的力量去遏止穿山甲的非法贸易。
I have been to Myanmar twice, and I also feel that Myanmar may not have the power to curb the illegal trade in pangolins for ethnic reasons, economic development issues and so on.
——————中国其实是有两个趋势。
There are actually two trends in China.
一个是提供保护的法律环境在变好，因为国家正在倡议把穿山甲升为一级保护动物，变成一级保护动物之后，就由国务院来审批它的药用。
One is that the legal environment for protection is improving, as the State Department approves the use of pangolin medicines after it has taken the initiative to upgrade the pangolin to a level 1 protective animal.
甚至我看到一个最新的报道，濒危野生动植物种国际贸易公约（CITES）的总干事来中国，国家林业局的官员告诉她，他们会倡议穿山甲去商业化，禁止商业用途，除非极个别的情况，尽量不药用。
I even read a recent report that the director-general of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) had come to China and officials from the State Forestry Administration told her that they would advocate the commercialization of pangolins and ban them for commercial use, except in rare cases and for as little medicinal use as possible.
另外一个就是，中国媒体或 NGO 可以去做更多的事，对有权力处理的部门（主要是林业部门和海关）进行监督和关注。
Another is that the Chinese media or NGOs can do more to monitor and focus on the sectors they have the power to deal with (mainly the forestry sector and customs).
我希望中国人尽量不要吃野味，因为这个行为又不文明又危险。
I hope the Chinese people try not to eat game, because this behavior is uncivilized and dangerous.
希望年轻一代 90 后、80 后没有这个习惯，因为这也一点也不酷。
Hopefully, the younger generation will not have this habit after 90 or 80, because it is not cool at all.
