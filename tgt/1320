那天我在金银潭医院交完货，已经是晚上六点。
I delivered the goods that day at the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital. It was 6 pm.
我这才想起来，原来已经整整24个小时没吃饭了。
I remember now that I hadn't had a meal for 24 hours.
路上连水都没怎么喝，也没觉得饿，人忙起来的时候感觉不到饿。
There was not much water to drink or hunger on the road, and people were too busy to feel hungry.
口述 | 宋　华整理 | 王仲昀来武汉半个多月，前天（2月14日）中午第一次比较正经地吃了午饭，是给金银潭医院送完物资之后他们安排的盒饭。
Wang Zhongyun came to Wuhan more than half a month ago. The day before yesterday (February 14), he had his first serious lunch at noon, a packed lunch they had arranged for the gold and silver pool hospital.
我非常感动。
I am very moved.
之前因为太忙，总是随身带点干粮就对付过去了。
I used to get by with some dry food because I was too busy.
我叫宋华，是上海CJ荣庆物流供应链公司运营部的一名副总监。
My name is Song Hua. I am a deputy director of Shanghai CJ Rongqing Logistics Supply Chain Company.
本来，今年过年是我二十多年来第一次回老家过年。
Originally, this year's Spring Festival is my first home in more than 20 years.
没想到在老家只呆了三天，我就跟着上海总部的长途货车来到武汉。
I didn't expect to stay in my hometown for three days, so I followed the long-distance truck of Shanghai headquarters to Wuhan.
在这里，我每天跟着武汉分公司的同事一起为武汉各大医院配送物资。
Here, I daily with Wuhan branch of colleagues for the major hospitals in Wuhan distribution of materials.
金银潭医院、协和医院、同济医院，我都跑了个遍。
Gold and Silver Pool Hospital, Concorde Hospital, Tongji Hospital, I have run all over.
这个春节，以及过去的半个多月，我觉得非常难忘。
This Spring Festival, as well as the past half a month, I feel very unforgettable.
宋华（右）和同事在武汉半个多月的第一顿午饭1997年，我们公司在上海正式成立。
Song Hua (right) and colleagues in Wuhan for more than half a month of the first lunch in 1997, our company was formally established in Shanghai.
从当年只有一辆货车，到现在全国各地都有分公司，用了23年。
From just one lorry in those days, there are now branches all over the country, and it has taken 23 years.
这23年，因为工作性质特殊，每年过年我都得在上海总部值班，没有回过山东老家。
For 23 years, due to the special nature of my work, I have to work in Shanghai headquarters every New Year.
孩子在上海出生后，至今不知道老家长啥样。
Children born in Shanghai, so far do not know what the old parents look like.
腊月二十八，我终于有机会带着家人回老家过年。
On the 28th of December, I finally had the opportunity to take my family home for the New Year.
但是看到新冠肺炎疫情暴发的新闻，我回到家也心急如焚，想要做点什么。
But when I saw news of the outbreak of pneumonia in the New Crown, I went home in a frenzy, trying to do something.
尤其是看到我们武汉分公司的总经理从老家返回武汉后，我也决定去往那边帮忙。
After seeing the general manager of our Wuhan branch return to Wuhan from my hometown, I also decided to go there to help.
武汉分公司春节期间还有几十名员工留守在那。
Wuhan Branch during the Spring Festival there are dozens of employees left behind.
大年初一晚上，我从老家开车返回上海，第二天中午到达。
On New Year's Eve, I drove back to Shanghai from my hometown and arrived at noon the next day.
知道总部在大年初一已有长途货车运送物资去了武汉后，我就向公司请示，希望跟着下一班货车去武汉帮忙。
Know that headquarters in the New Year's Day has long-distance goods vehicles to Wuhan, I asked the company, hoping to follow the next lorry to Wuhan to help.
就这样，大年初三我接到通知后，就和另外两名司机拉着460套为上海援鄂医疗队准备的大衣出发了。
In this way, on the third day of the New Year, I set off with two other drivers pulling 460 coats for the medical team in Shanghai.
大家都知道，医务人员在隔离病房工作时，不能开空调。
It is well known that medical staff cannot operate air conditioners while working in isolation wards.
这样到晚上就很冷，容易感冒。
This makes it very cold by night and easy to catch cold.
这批大衣就是为他们准备的。
These overcoats are for them.
车开出上海，我们先去了趟无锡，在那里带上了南京大学校友会筹集的一批口罩。
The car left Shanghai, we went first to Wuxi, where we took a collection of masks raised by the Nanjing University Alumni Association.
在路上的时候，我只想这车能更快一点，越快越好。
On the way, I just thought the car would be faster, faster, better.
第二天下午一点，也就是大年初四，我们终于到达武汉。
The next afternoon at 1: 00 p.m., that is, about four years ago, we finally arrived in Wuhan.
到了凤凰山高速口，有武汉红十字会以及当地其他一些慈善机构的工作人员在等我们。
At the Fenghuangshan Expressway, staff from the Wuhan Red Cross and other local charities are waiting for us.
我们在那边先交接了一批物资。
We handed over a batch of goods there first.
之后和上海援鄂医疗队相关同志联系，分别把物资给他们送到所在的医院。
After contact with the relevant comrades of the Shanghai medical team Hubei, supplies were sent to their respective hospitals.
医疗队的同志和我们见面时，大家都非常激动，还一块合了影。
When the comrades of the medical team met us, they were all very excited and took a picture together.
我在凤凰山高速口留影和上海援鄂医疗队同志留影那天我在金银潭医院交完货，已经是晚上六点。
On the day of my photo taken at the Fenghuangshan Speedway and the photo taken by Comrade Hubei Medical Team, I delivered the goods at the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital.
我这才想起来，原来已经整整24个小时没吃饭了。
I remember now that I hadn't had a meal for 24 hours.
路上连水都没怎么喝，也没觉得饿，人忙起来的时候感觉不到饿。
There was not much water to drink or hunger on the road, and people were too busy to feel hungry.
我到武汉后，和分公司的人商量了一下。
After I went to Wuhan, I discussed it with the people in my branch office.
为了保护我们留守武汉的员工安全健康，我们决定，让员工留守公司，哪都不要去。
In order to protect the safety and health of our staff left behind in Wuhan, we decided to leave the staff behind, not going anywhere.
我自己，和分公司总经理常军、副总经理严效文、值班负责人宋伟康以及两名驾驶员组成“应急配送小组”，承担一线配送任务。
I myself, with the general manager of the branch, deputy general manager Yan Xiaowen, duty officer Song Weikang and two drivers make up the "emergency distribution team", undertake the first-line distribution task.
然后我也告诉了上海援鄂医疗队的联系人，我说接下来我会一直在这里，如果你们有需求，可以找我。
Then I also told the contact of the medical team in Hubei that I would be here all the time. If you need me, you can call me.
从1月29日早上开始，我们这个“应急配送小组”的工作就正式开始了。
From the morning of January 29, the work of our "emergency distribution team" began.
我们的工作，像是物资的一次中转。
Our work, like a transit of supplies.
因为很多运输物资的大货车，没办法在武汉市区开，那么这些大货车到武汉会先开到我们公司的仓库，然后由我们的货车把物资转送到目的地。
Since many large trucks carrying goods cannot be opened in Wuhan city, they will drive to our company's warehouse when they arrive in Wuhan, and then the goods will be transferred to their destination by our van.
我们配送的物资都是送给医院的，主要是社会各界捐赠或者筹集的。
All the materials we send are for hospitals, mainly donated or raised by the whole society.
目前来看，这些物资多种多样，最主要的是医院这段时间需要的各种医疗器械。
At present, these materials are diverse, the most important being the various medical devices needed by the hospital during this period.
另外，还有各种医用口罩、打印机、药物、防护服、食物。
In addition, there are a variety of medical masks, printers, medicines, protective clothing, food.
像2月13日，我们公司自己弄了一批拌面，就给各个医院送去了。
Like February 13, our own company made a batch of noodles, to the various hospitals to send.
宋华及同事在武汉与医务人员合影一方面，我们负责把外界送来武汉的物资转到医院；另一方面，我们也尽自己所能，去帮助这些医务工作者。
On the one hand, we are responsible for transferring the materials brought to Wuhan from outside to the hospital. On the other hand, we try our best to help these medical workers.
像上海援鄂医疗队刚来的时候，会有一些临时的需求，比如某一天突然要几台电脑和投影仪，当地医院一下子没法弄到，毕竟现在无论是网购还是实体店都不方便，那我们就帮人家想想办法。
When the medical team arrived in Shanghai, there were some temporary needs, such as a few computers and projectors, which the local hospital could not get at once. After all, it is not convenient to buy a computer or a physical store.
来武汉将近20天，现在武汉的大街小巷还是看不到什么人和车。
Wuhan almost 20 days, now Wuhan streets and alleys or see few people and cars.
医院我们倒是跑得非常熟悉了，金银潭医院，以及协和医院和同济医院各个院区，我们几乎每天都要去。
We were very familiar with the hospital. We went to the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital, the Concorde Hospital and the Tongji Hospital almost every day.
火神山、雷神山医院也都去过。
Flamingo Mountain and Lei Shenshan Hospital have also been there.
印象很深的是，去火神山送物资时，外面马路上停满了和我们一样来送物资的货车，排成了两三公里长的车队，非常壮观。
Impressive as it was, the road outside was filled with lorries, like ours, carrying supplies. It was a magnificent two or three kilometres long convoy.
除了物资，我们每天也要和医院的医生护士们打交道。
In addition to supplies, we have to deal with doctors and nurses in hospitals every day.
之前我们武汉分公司的员工跟我说，看到我每天在最前线工作，他们也很受鼓舞，很温暖，也更有信心了。
Our Wuhan branch staff told me that they were also encouraged, warm and confident to see me working in the front line every day.
我想说，我看到医护人员时，也有同样的心情。
I would say that I feel the same way when I see the paramedics.
像我们每天从早上五六点开始运货，一直到夜里结束。
: We start moving goods every day from five to six in the morning until the end of the night.
有人会认为这很辛苦，但其实作为物流人，我们已经习惯了这种工作状态。
Some people may think it's hard work, but as logistics people, we are used to this kind of working state.
而且我觉得跟医务人员相比，我们已经很轻松很幸福了。
And I think we're very relaxed and happy compared to the medical staff.
他们的热情、忘我的工作状态都给我留下很深的印象。
I was very impressed by their enthusiasm and selfless work.
今天金银潭医院办公室的谢主任告诉我，哪怕以后我们中午不来这边送货，只要想吃午饭就可以跟她打招呼。
Today, Chea from the office of Gold and Silver Pool Hospital told me that even if we don't deliver here at noon, we can just say hello to her if we want to have lunch.
她说，她很敬佩这次上海过来援助的人们。
She said she admired the people who came to Shanghai to help.
刚开始的时候，有一次我们要送医用试剂到金银潭医院。
At first, we had to send medical reagents to the gold and silver pool hospital.
那次我穿过住院部，离确诊患者的隔离病房距离只有几米，而且还没有防护服。
I walked through the inpatient section a few meters from the isolation ward of the patient and had no protective clothing.
其实心里还是有一点害怕的。
In fact, there is still a little fear.
但我想这就是物流人的职责，再想想医务人员每天都要面对患者，慢慢的也就不恐惧了。
But I think this is the logistics person's responsibility, and think about the medical personnel have to face patients every day, slowly also do not fear.
随着在武汉的日子越来越久，我们配送物资的对象也变得多了。
With the days in Wuhan more and more, we have become more and more material distribution objects.
这两天除了医院，我们还给那些在执勤的特警送了各种物资。
In addition to the hospital these two days, we also delivered all kinds of materials to the special police on duty.
昨夜武汉下起了中雪，我们到达其中一个执勤点是晚上九点。
It snowed last night in Wuhan, and we arrived at one of the stations at 9 pm.
送完物资，对方得知我们一天没吃饭，便专门去给我们准备了晚饭。
After delivering the goods, the other side learned that we had not had dinner for a day, so he went to prepare dinner specially for us.
吃饭时，我们把货车车头当桌子，头上正飘着雪花。
As we ate, we used the front of the van as a table, snowed overhead.
现在是特殊时期，我做的这些事情，我不做，总有人要做。
Now is a special time, I do these things, I do not do, there is always someone to do.
社会需要我，我就会一直坚守在自己的岗位上。
Society needs me, and I will always stick to my position.
疫情不结束，我不会撤退。
I will not withdraw until the epidemic is over.
