记者/李东编辑/石爱华 宋建华东召庄村的村口被彩钢板“焊死”河北邯郸市的一个小村庄东召庄村，像北方大多数农村一样，至今留着诸多春节传统，抬花桌、拜年、祭祖等等。
Reporter / Li Dong Editors / Shi Ai Hua Song Jianghua Village Village Village in East China was "welded to death" by colored steel plates. Like most rural villages in the north, Zhuangcun is still replete with Spring Festival traditions, carrying flower tables, paying New Year visits and offering sacrifices to ancestors.
武汉疫情爆发后，村里的防疫措施不断升级，东召庄村的风俗习惯和日常生活也不断被“挤压”，从禁止拜年祭祖，到黄土堵路，再到彩钢板封村。
Since the outbreak of the epidemic in Wuhan, the village's epidemic prevention measures have been constantly upgraded, the customs and daily life of Dongchuanzhuang village have been constantly "squeezed," from the prohibition of New Year Festivals, to the blockage of loess roads to the sealing of colored steel plates.
村干部李峰从最初的“纠结”变成了现在的“果断”，他很理解那个在村广播里粗旷表达的河南“硬核书记”，“真没别的办法了”，李峰说，在非常时期，村干部就要像个“非常”家长，“不择手段，保护村民”。
Li Feng, a village official, changed his initial "entanglement" to "decisiveness." He understood the "hard-core secretary" of Henan who spoke on the village radio. "There is really no other way," Li said.
封村之前，在村口摆摊的商贩被无视的村广播防疫消息像一股浪一样，突然就涌进了村。
Before the village was closed, the village radio and immunization news, which had been ignored by vendors at the entrance to the village, suddenly flowed into the village like a wave.
东召庄村位于河北省邯郸市永年区，拥有人口4400人。
Dongchuanzhuang Village is located in Yongnian District Handan City Hebei Province and has a population of 4400.
村支书李峰40岁，在村上当书记已超过十年。
Village branch book Li Feng 40 years old, in the village has been secretary for more than 10 years.
1月22日，李峰边吃午饭边看新闻，新冠肺炎感染确诊人数增多的消息不断传来，他推测，镇政府下午召开的紧急会议，多半与疫情有关。
On January 22, while Mr. Li was reading the news while eating lunch, news of an increase in the number of people diagnosed with pneumonia in the New Crown was coming in, and he speculated that most of the emergency meetings held in the afternoon by the township government were related to the outbreak.
不出所料，会上各村党支部书接到的任务是“引起村民重视”。
Not surprisingly, the village branches of the book received the task "to arouse the attention of the villagers."
李峰当村支书10年，修路、建学校都干过，但组织防疫还是头一回。
Li Feng Dang village branch 10 years, road construction, school have done, but the organization of immunization is the first time.
东召庄村与永年区主城区只有一路之隔，人流量大，在外务工的村民约有1100人，适逢春节返乡，走亲访友的村民数量大，防疫工作从哪做起，李峰一时没有思路。
Dongchuang Village and the main urban areas of YongNian only all the way, the flow of people, migrant workers about 1,100 villagers, when the Spring Festival return home, visiting relatives and friends of the villagers, from where the epidemic prevention work started, Li Feng did not have the idea.
从镇上开会回来，李峰让广播员进行了第一次广播，从下午4点到晚上8点，东召庄村南北两组大喇叭轮流循环广播最新疫情，并不断叮嘱村民“勤洗手、戴口罩、不要扎堆，尽量别出门”。
Returning from the town meeting, Li Feng asked the announcer to make his first broadcast. From 4pm to 8pm, two groups of loudspeakers from the north and the south of Chuang Chuang took turns broadcasting the latest epidemic.
22日晚，全国25个省份已经确诊新冠肺炎571例，有的省份已启动了重大突发公共卫生事件一级响应。
On the evening of the 22nd, 571 new cases of pneumonia were diagnosed in 25 provinces across the country, some of which had already initiated a first-level response to major public health emergencies.
当天晚上，河北确诊了首例新冠肺炎病例，就在石家庄市，距离东召庄村约150公里。
That night, Hebei confirmed the first case of new crown pneumonia, just in Shijiazhuang, about 150 kilometers from Dongchuang Village.
李峰把这条信息甩进村子微信群里，附了一段语音：“河北已经出现了，请大家务必重视起来，配合村里工作，做好防护。
Li Feng dropped the message into the village micro-letter group, attached a voice: "Hebei has appeared, please pay attention to the work in the village, do a good job of protection.
”“刷到河北确诊病例时，像疫情突然就到了身边似的”，李峰在22日夜里开了村里的疫情防控会，村干部商量，还是要求村民尽量不出门。
"When brushed to the confirmed case in Hebei province, it was like the outbreak had suddenly come to the side." Li Feng opened the village's disease prevention and control meeting on the night of the 22nd and asked the villagers to stay inside as long as possible.
但此后两日，循环广播的声音消匿在春节的气氛里，村民像是没听到一样。
But for the next two days, the sound of circular broadcasts faded into oblivion during the Spring Festival. The villagers did not seem to hear it.
村民们照旧收拾房子、倒垃圾、贴春联；村边商店经营如常，村民来来往往采购年货；村内小广场的太阳地上，小孩们扎堆儿游戏，老人坐着闲聊。
Villagers still packed their houses, emptied their rubbish and posted Spring Festival couplets. Villagers used to shop around the village, buying New Year's goods. On the sun in the village square, the children played and the old man sat chatting.
有子女给长辈送来口罩，老人直接塞进兜里。
Children brought masks to their elders, and the old man stuffed them directly into his pockets.
为了控制村民出入，村口用黄土堵路难改变的风俗1月24日是大年三十，春节晚会里插播了有关武汉抗击疫情的节目，当晚新冠肺炎确诊人数已经达1287例。
In order to control the entry and exit of villagers, the village head of the road with loess difficult to change the customs January 24 is the 30th anniversary of the Spring Festival Gala broadcast about Wuhan to fight the epidemic, the night the number of confirmed cases of New Crown Pneumonia has reached 1,287.
晚上10点半，李峰纠结很久，还是来到村委会的广播室，宣布禁止拜年的通知，“万一病毒传进村里，我对不起大家。
At 10: 30 pm, Li Feng tangled for a long time, or came to the village committee's radio studio, announced the ban on New Year's notice, "in case the virus into the village, I apologize to everyone.
”“全体村民注意，由于预防肺炎疫情的需要，社员们明天不要拜年，不要串门，不要外出走动……”广播重复了5次。
"" All the villagers notice that due to the need to prevent pneumonia, the commune members will not pay a New Year call tomorrow, do not drop in or walk about... "
东召庄村保留着许多传统的风俗习惯，“抬花桌”就是其中之一。
Dongchuang Village retains many traditional customs, "carry the flower table" is one of them.
除夕夜里，村里会组织20余名村民吹打着乐器、抬着花桌转遍村子的每个角落，祈祷来年风调雨顺。
On New Year's Eve, more than 20 villagers are organized to play musical instruments and carry flower tables around the village, praying for rain and shine in the coming year.
广播之前，“抬花桌”仪式刚刚结束。
Before the broadcast, the "Flower Table" ceremony had just ended.
正月初一，街坊们上门拜年也是最重要的传统。
On the first day of the first month, neighborhood visits are also the most important tradition.
在老一辈村民的观念里，不给长辈拜年“不成体统”，年轻人不给彼此父母拜年甚至会被视为“绝交”的信号。
In the view of the old villagers, it is not proper to pay a New Year call to the elders, and young people do not pay New Year visits to each other's parents may even be regarded as a sign of disconnection.
在除夕夜宣布不拜年，村民难理解，不少人人索性聚集到胡同里叽叽喳喳议论起来。
In the New Year's Eve announced that the New Year, villagers difficult to understand, many people simply gathered in the alley chattering.
李明入冬时新婚，媳妇是邻村人，按照村里的习俗，新媳妇要在婚后的第一个春节由李明的嫂子们带着，去给家族里的每一位长辈拜年，算是新媳妇认家门。
According to the custom in the village, the bride-in-law has to pay a New Year call to all her elders in the family so that the bride-in-law can recognize the family by bringing them with her during the first Spring Festival.
年轻的邻居认为，非常时期不拜年也是为了大家好，这个时候也不会有人在意这些传统讲究。
Young neighbors believe that the unusual times do not visit the New Year is also for the good of everyone, this time no one will care about these traditions.
但李明的父亲坚持必须要拜年，平辈的邻居安慰他：“别上火，拜个年快去快回就妥了，你急个啥？”李明的父亲向邻居们抱怨，“在村里拜个年，几分钟的事，看你村里怎么禁止？”他打算照旧去拜年，速去速回。
But Li Ming's father insisted on paying a New Year call, and his neighbors comforted him: "Don't get angry, just go home soon, what's the matter?" Li Ming's father complained to his neighbors.
作为村支书，往年来李峰家里拜年的晚辈儿不少，他在大喇叭里宣布今年不拜年后，大年初一，一个上门的也没有。
As a village support, Li Feng family in previous years, many of the younger generation, he announced in the loudspeaker this year did not pay New Year's Day, a door did not come.
但村里照旧有大量串门拜年的村民，这让李峰和其他村干部无奈。
But there are still a large number of villagers visiting the village, which left Li Feng and other village cadres helpless.
村里的喇叭再次响起，劝拜年的人回家。
The village trumpet sounded again, urging the New Year callers to return home.
一个没戴口罩的中年人经过村部门口时“偶遇”村主任，被劝回家，“你不怕死，别人还要命嘞！”最终，李明的媳妇只到邻近的长辈家拜了年，远处的亲戚家没去。
When a middle-aged man without a mask passed by the mouth of the village department, he was persuaded to come home and say, "You are not afraid to die, but people still want orders.
婆婆通过手机向亲戚们表达歉意，本应亲自给新媳妇的红包，亲戚们通过微信转了账。
The mother-in-law apologized to her relatives on her cell phone, who should have given the bride's red envelope in person.
村委会成员当晚汇总情况时发现，以往多是成群结队步行去拜年，今年骑着电动车单独“行动”的增多。
When village committee members gathered together that night, they found that the number of people who used to walk in droves to celebrate the New Year had increased.
串门拜年的人来去匆匆，只有个别人没戴口罩，李峰比较安慰，“村民已经开始有防护意识了。
Only a few people did not wear masks, Li Feng more comforted, "villagers have begun to have a sense of protection.
”村口用彩钢板被“焊死”，贴上了防疫横幅被“焊死”的村口1月26日，正月初二，在东召庄村的习俗里，是远房亲戚相互拜年的日子。
Village with colored steel plate was "welded to death", affixed with the anti-epidemic banner was "welded to death" of the village on January 26, the second day of the first month, in the village of Dongchuanzhuang, is the day distant relatives visit each other New Year.
天蒙蒙亮时，大喇叭里又一次播出了疫情防控的新通知：“请社员们注意，今天不拜年，我们村马上封路，咱们不出去，也禁止外村人进来，请立刻电话、微信通知外村亲戚不要来。
As the day dawned, a new announcement on the prevention and control of the epidemic was broadcast on the loudspeaker: "Please note that there will be no New Year call today. Our village will be closed immediately.
”早6点到7点的一个小时里，一辆拖拉机在村子的8个出入口卸下黄土，将路截开，只在主街道，为应急车辆通行留出必要空间。
In the hour between 6 and 7 a.m., a tractor unloaded loess at eight entrances to the village, cutting off the road and leaving the necessary space for emergency traffic on the main street.
各村口，村民代表紧急上岗值班，将土装在蛇皮袋子一字排开，挡住7个村口。
Each village, village representatives on emergency duty, will be installed in snakeskin bags lined up, blocking the entrance to seven villages.
22日以后，镇里有关防疫工作的会议一下多起来，有时一天两场，村党支部书记必须参加。
After the 22nd, the town about the epidemic prevention work a lot of meetings, sometimes twice a day, the village party branch secretary must attend.
村里的会议也频繁起来，“封村”决定在25日晚上的会上被表决通过。
Village meetings are also frequent, the "Village Sealing" decided to be voted on the evening of the 25th meeting.
村支书李峰把封村的消息同时发送到了村微信群里，强调“为了全村村民的安全，请大家务必克服一切困难，不要接触外村人”。
"For the sake of the safety of the villagers, please make sure to overcome all difficulties and avoid contact with outsiders," said Li Feng, the village secretary.
这次下禁令，他没有犹豫。
This time he did not hesitate to impose a ban.
这一天，李峰看了河南“硬核村书记”的广播，他能理解河南书记粗旷的表达，“那真的是实在没有办法了”。
That day, Li Feng saw Henan "hard core village secretary" broadcast, he can understand the Secretary of Henan rough expression, "that really is no way."
多数村民们在微信群里支持封村，但初二上午仍有村民在街上溜达。
Most of the villagers supported the closure of the village in a small crowd, but villagers were still wandering the streets on the morning of the second day of junior high school.
有村民试图说服把守村口的村民代表，被拒绝后，干脆直接搬开其他出口的土袋子，骑车冲了出去。
Some villagers tried to persuade the villagers who were guarding the entrance to the village to refuse, simply moved away from the other exits and rode out.
这天，永年区启动了重大突发公共卫生事件一级响应。
On this day, Yongnian District launched a major public health emergency level response.
东召庄村通往主城区的路口，出现了警察和医生，凡是进主城区，只能在测体温没异常后才放行。
Dongzhuang Village to the junction of the main city, the emergence of police and doctors, who entered the main city, can only be taken after the abnormal temperature test.
这是许多村民没有经历过的场面，消息传到村微信群里，几十条“求口罩”的信息在群里出现。
This is not experienced by many villagers, the news spread to the village micro-letter, dozens of "mask" information appeared in the group.
1月26日晚8点，李峰和村干部通过大喇叭，又发布了一条“禁令”：“初三禁止出村祭祖”。
January 26 evening, Li Feng and village cadres through the loudspeaker, issued a "ban": "The third day of the village ancestors banned."
王刚听到这个消息时，认为不去祭祖是大忌，他专门到邻居家里商量对策。
When Wang just heard this news, think not to sacrifice ancestors is taboo, he went to the neighbor's home to discuss countermeasures.
以往，祭祖活动都在初三天亮后到中午前进行。
In the past, the ancestors of the activities in the third day of dawn to noon before the conduct.
王刚与邻居商量好，初三凌晨5点出村去墓地，赶天亮前回村，来回都走小路，跳过土方袋即可顺利出入村子。
Wang Gang and his neighbor agreed to leave the village at 5 a.m. on the third day of the village, before dawn back to the village, back and forth all the way back and forth, jumping earth bags can be smooth access to the village.
他们推测，“守村口的村民代表那时候还没起床”。
They speculate that "village representatives guarding the entrance to the village had not got up yet."
第二天清早，王刚和邻居去时发现，基本每家都有人去祭祖了。
The next morning, Wang Gang and his neighbors to find that the basic family are people went to the ancestors.
天亮后，各村口的土方袋多多少少都有被搬开的痕迹。
After daybreak, the earthwork bags at the entrance to the villages bore more or less the marks of removal.
李峰既着急又无奈，“我也知道祭祖是大事，那也不能不要命吧？”在村“两委”干部会上，李峰有点急了。
Li Feng both anxious and helpless, "I also know the ancestor is a major event, that can not help dying?" In the village "two committee" cadres meeting, Li Feng a little anxious.
“关系生命安全的事，再重要的习俗也必须让步。
Even the most important custom must yield when it comes to the safety of life.
”此后，各村口加装了彩钢板，路口被直接“焊死”，除主街道口外，凡是进人的口均被截断。
Since then, the villages have been fitted with color steel plates, the junction was directly "welded to death," except for the main street entrance, all people's mouth was cut off.
李峰在部登记武汉返乡村民情况隔壁工厂的确诊病例1月30日，东召庄村的防疫再次升级。
Li Feng registered in the Ministry of Wuhan returning to the villagers situation next to the factory confirmed the case January 30, Dongchuanzhuang village epidemic prevention once again upgraded.
“所有出村村民必须持所在单位证明到村部报备，否则一律不准出村”的消息，以命令的口吻从大喇叭里播发。
"All villagers must show their unit certificate to the village, otherwise no one is allowed to leave the village," the tone of command from the loudspeaker broadcast.
村部和主街道口陆续出现来询问情况的村民，村委会将红纸黑字的“告知书”贴出来让村民自己看。
Village departments and the main street entrance to the villagers came to inquire about the situation, the village committee will be written in black "notice" affixed out for the villagers to see.
在李峰看来，这应该是村部能做出的最严的封村令了。
In Li Feng's view, this should be the village department can make the most stringent closure order.
为了更好的下达通知，他召集村里各大家族中有威望的老人来开会，动员他们做好自己家族的工作。
To better inform him, he summoned the respected elders of the village families to a meeting and to motivate them to do their family work.
“虽然有违习俗，但是为了保命”，这次的传达效果很好，街上的村民少了很多。
"It was against custom, but to save lives," the message was good, and there were far fewer villagers on the street.
让李峰过意不去的，是对武汉返乡人员的排查。
Let Li Feng regret, is to Wuhan returning to the personnel of the inventory.
从1月22日开始，村里就按照要求对武汉返乡村民进行重点排查。
From January 22, the village in accordance with the requirements of returning to Wuhan villagers to carry out a key search.
一位村民订了23日从邯郸飞往武汉的机票，临登机时取消了行程，被村干部排查到。
A villager booked a flight ticket from Handan to Wuhan on the 23rd. He cancelled his flight on boarding and was picked up by village officials.
村里一位货车司机在20日经过武汉的高速路，返回村子后，也被村委会询问了情况。
A village truck driver who passed Wuhan expressway on the 20th, returned to the village, was also questioned by the village committee.
李峰对近期有武汉接触史的村民，排查了至少两遍，有关人员情况如实上报。
Li Feng recently have Wuhan contact history of the villagers, at least twice, the relevant personnel reported the truth.
但镇里多次发来的排查名单，与村里自查的名单出现重复，村干部必须一遍一遍地反复询问排查，“春节期间，一再因这个事打扰他们，难免会让周边人产生偏见。
But the numerous lists sent by the town duplicated the lists of the villagers themselves, and the village officials had to ask and answer questions over and over again. During the Spring Festival, they were constantly disturbed by this incident, which inevitably led to prejudice among the people around them
”东召庄村一共有3人从武汉返乡，赵迁是其中之一，1月14号回老家时，他已经从网上看到了有关新冠肺炎的消息，回来后他没有过多接触外人，自己每天测体温。
Zhao Qian, one of three who returned home from Wuhan on January 14, had seen news of the new crown pneumonia on the Internet and returned home without much contact with outsiders to take his temperature every day.
村委会排查到他时，他已经回村10天，现在3名村医分别负责3个武汉返乡村民的体温测试，每天两次。
By the time he was picked up by the village council, he had returned to his village for 10 days, and three village doctors were now conducting two temperature tests a day for three returning villagers in Wuhan.
1月27日，一份近期从武汉回邯郸人员名单被一村民发到了微信群，赵迁的身份信息也被曝光，那天起，赵迁开始不断接到朋友打来的电话，重复解释着自已的身体情况。
On January 27, a list of people who had recently returned to Handan from Wuhan was sent by a villager to a small group of people. Zhao Qian's identity information was also revealed.
“这可好，大年过的，我去见谁都像要害人家似的！”赵迁无奈。
"This is good, the big year, I went to see everyone like a home!" Zhao Qian helpless.
李峰看到群里的消息时，这份名单已无法撤回，他只能在群里一再叮嘱“不要乱传，不要对他们有偏见”。
When Li Feng saw the news in the group, the list could not be withdrawn, he could only repeat in the group "do not misrepresent, do not prejudice them."
群里这些“叮嘱”消息很快淹没在各种对肺炎疫情的讨论中。
The "orders" from the group quickly submerged in discussions of the pneumonia epidemic.
2月5日，与东召庄村紧邻的化肥厂家属院出现一例新冠肺炎的确诊病例，当天，这栋家属楼实行封闭式管理。
On February 5, a confirmed case of New Crown Pneumonia was found in the family home of the fertilizer factory next to Dongchuang Village. The building was under closed management the same day.
东召庄村的防控措施因此再次提升。
As a result, control measures in Dongchuang Village have been upgraded.
此前，村民持有单位介绍信可在7日内自由出入村子，现在，单位介绍信的有效期缩短为1天。
Previously, villagers had been granted free access to the village within seven days with a letter of introduction from their unit, which has now been shortened to one day.
凡是出入村子的村民必须由村主任签字同意。
All villagers entering or leaving the village must sign and consent to it by the village director.
偶尔有村民出去送饭、买菜，均由村口值守的村民代表代劳。
Occasionally, villagers go out to deliver food and buy vegetables, which are served by village representatives.
一些村民开始在群里庆幸东召庄村封村及时，谁也没想到，这场自武汉而来的疫情，真的到了村口。
Some villagers began to celebrate in the group Zhuangcun Village in time, who did not expect that this outbreak from Wuhan, really came to the village.
