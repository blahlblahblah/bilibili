人是一种社会生物，这就是为什么我们需要缔结社会契约，而新冠病毒可能就是那个触发点图/视觉中国文 | 沈联涛香港乃至许多亚洲人都信奉的新自由主义秩序，建基于自由市场，以及一个重要的社会契约之上：每个公民都会得到国家和市场看顾。
The human being is a social creature, which is why we need to conclude a social contract, and the new crown virus may be the neoliberal order that Shen Liantao and many Asians believe in, based on the free market, and an important social contract in which every citizen is looked after by the state and the market.
这场新冠病毒疫情则提出了一个根本问题，即社会能否依照社会契约之承诺，看顾到每个公民？“社会契约”这一概念源于法国大革命先驱和启蒙思想家卢梭的一本书。
The new crown-virus epidemic raises the fundamental question of whether society can care for every citizen in accordance with the promise of a social contract, a concept derived from a book by Rousseau, the pioneer and enlightening thinker of the French Revolution.
根据这一概念，个人与国家之间存在一项契约，国家承诺个人拥有其天赋的法定权利，并对其予以保护。
According to this concept, there exists a contract between the individual and the State, in which the State undertakes to have and protect the legal rights inherent in the individual.
卢梭区分了所谓的自然不平等与道德或政治不平等。
Rousseau distinguished between so-called natural inequalities and moral or political inequalities.
在《社会契约论》（1762）开篇处，卢梭有一个著名的论断——“人生而自由，却无往而不在枷锁中”，这成为法国大革命的先声，但不幸的是，他本人却在1778年去世了。
Rousseau's famous assertion, at the beginning of the Social Contract (1762), that "man was born free without chains," was the forerunner of the French Revolution, but, unfortunately, he himself died in 1778.
当中国和其他国家数百万人因新冠病毒疫情而在家中自我隔离时，他们总算有时间远离狗苟蝇营，开始思考生活真正的意义。
When millions of people in China and other countries are isolated from their homes by the new crown virus, they finally have time to move away from dog camps and start thinking about what life really means.
但是，自由市场要求最低限度的政府参与，若真如此，如何应对这样规模的疫情？此外，在惶急之中人们莫衷一是，一个完全民主的政府能否处理好近期历史上前所未见的新危机？新自由主义所宣扬与其所真正达成的结果之间的落差，使人们对其大失所望，从而在西方引发民主是否失灵的争论。
But how can a fully democratic government deal with a new crisis of this magnitude, which requires minimal government involvement? Moreover, the gap between what neoliberalism preaches and what it has actually achieved has fueled deep disillusionment over whether democracy has failed in the West.
麦肯锡全球研究院在近期发布了一篇出色的调查报告，考察了22个发达经济体（它们占据世界GDP的57％）内工人、消费者和储蓄者的今昔变化。
The McKinsey Global Institute recently published an excellent survey of workers, consumers, and savers in 22 advanced economies (which account for 57% of world GDP).
新自由主义秩序宣扬自由市场、个人自由、人权、法治和选举民主——本质上是民有、民治、民享的政府。
The neoliberal order preaches free markets, individual freedoms, human rights, the rule of law, and electoral democracy - essentially government by the people, by the people, for the people.
但麦肯锡发现，自上世纪70年代以来，22个经合组织国家的工人、消费者和储蓄者，虽然获得了更多工作机会，但其作为雇员的权益则受到侵蚀，工作缺乏安全感，退休后的养老金和医疗保健捉襟见肘，而储蓄者则没有获得足够多的收入。
But since the 1970s, McKinsey has found that workers, consumers and savers in 22 OECD countries who have gained more jobs have suffered erosion of their rights as employees, job insecurity, overstretched pensions and health care after retirement and insufficient income for savers.
尽管平均收入有所增加，但中位数（大多数处于中等水平的人）的状况实际上变差了。
Despite the increase in average income, the situation of the median (the majority of those at the medium level) has actually deteriorated.
由于新自由主义意识形态主张自由市场竞争，工会权力遭到了削弱，签订短期合同的人数变多，收入的不安全感大为增加。
Trade union power had been weakened by neoliberal ideology advocating free market competition, the number of short-term contracts had increased and income insecurity had increased considerably.
同时，由于“购买者当心”条款将责任转移给了不了解他们所冒风险的消费者和投资者，消费者权益的保障也在恶化。
At the same time, consumer protection has deteriorated as the "buyer beware" clause shifts responsibility to consumers and investors who are unaware of the risks they are taking.
此外，养老金权益从“固定收益”转变为“固定缴款”，养老金收益的风险便从雇主转移给了雇员。
In addition, pension benefits change from "fixed income" to "defined contribution" and the risk of pension benefits is transferred from the employer to the employee.
例如，受调查者中有一半的成年人退休后可能入不敷出，而四分之一的人根本就没有储蓄。
For example, half of the adults surveyed may not be able to make ends meet when they retire, while a quarter have no savings at all.
事实上，尽管美国可能是经合组织中经济表现最好的国家，但该国23％家庭的净资产为零或负值，而2001年时这个数额还是16％。
Indeed, while the US is probably the best performing OECD country, 23% of households have net assets of zero or negative, up from 16% in 2001.
因此，当乐施会宣布世界上最富有的那1％，其占有财富是剩余69亿人财富的两倍以上，难怪人们会觉得这个体制被一些人玩弄于鼓掌。
Thus, when Oxfam announces that the richest 1 per cent of the world has more than twice the wealth of the remaining 6.9 billion people, it is no wonder that people feel that the system is being used by some to clap.
不平等已经演变成了极端不公正。
Inequality has become an extreme injustice.
国内生产总值在增加，但人们的切身感受却是经济变差了。
Gross domestic product (GDP) is rising, but the economy is getting worse.
该如何应对这种不平等？麦肯锡提出，21世纪未来几十年有两个优先事项。
McKinsey argues that there are two priorities for the next few decades of the 21st century.
首先，通过技术、生产力进步和创造更多就业机会，以增加人们的收益。
First, to increase people's earnings through technology, productivity improvements and the creation of more jobs.
第二，寻找解决方案，改善受影响最严重群体的状况，这些人包括低技能、低工资的工人，妇女和少数族裔群体，欠发达地区的人们，以及年轻人。
Secondly, solutions must be found to improve the situation of the most affected groups, including low-skilled, low-wage workers, women and ethnic minority groups, people in less developed regions, and young people.
但这意味着政界和国家要达成共识，以向富人征税，为大众增加投入，以及为所有人提供更完善的保障。
But that means a political and national consensus to tax the rich, invest more in the masses, and provide better security for all.
正如最近的全球怀疑主义情绪所展现的，上述几项能否实现，还要打一个大大的问号。
As recent global scepticism shows, there is still a big question mark over whether these things will happen.
产业革命促生了一种观念，即科学技术将带来更大程度的自由和机会，以及民主和大众获得更多知识（比如通过互联网），从而让所有人享有更平等的机会。
The industrial revolution has given rise to the idea that science and technology will bring greater freedom and opportunity, as well as democracy and greater public access to knowledge (for example, through the Internet), thereby providing more equal opportunities for all.
如同香港的例子所表明，在自由市场环境下，尽管更容易获取知识，但如果整体的体制缺乏足够政治意愿，以缓解日益加重的不平等，官僚机构也不知道如何适应不断变化的环境，那么即便政府有着美好的出发点，不平等仍会加剧。
As the example of Hong Kong shows, in a free market environment, while knowledge is more readily available, inequality can increase even when Governments have a good point of departure if the overall system lacks sufficient political will to mitigate growing inequalities and bureaucracies do not know how to adapt to changing circumstances.
当无法估计危机的后果时，只有三种选择：战斗、逃跑、团结一致。
When it is impossible to estimate the consequences of a crisis, there are only three options: combat, flight, and solidarity.
相互之间的斗争无济于事，因为大家共同面对的威胁事关生存，无关乎肤色或富裕程度，所有人的生存机会几无差别。
There is no point in fighting each other, because the threats we all face are existential, not related to skin colour or affluence, and all have little chance of survival.
一部分医护人员罢工时，医院员工将如何应对医疗危机？逃避毫无意义，恐惧会加剧无知和偏见，例如谢菲尔德的中国学生因戴口罩而受到攻击。
How will hospital staff deal with a medical crisis when some health-care workers go on strike? There is no point in running away, fear exacerbates ignorance and prejudice, as when Chinese students in Sheffield are attacked for wearing masks.
在这场生死存亡的危机中，唯一有希望的选择是团结、合作，刷新社会契约。
In this existential crisis, the only promising option is solidarity, cooperation and a renewal of the social contract.
即使是最高效的政府，面对如此速度和规模的流行病疫情，或者未来将爆发的此类疫病，他们既有的知识和经验也完全不够用。
Even the most efficient governments, faced with an epidemic of such speed and magnitude, or one that will erupt in the future, have far too little knowledge and experience.
单靠国家无法解决这个问题。
States alone cannot solve this problem.
必须所有人勠力同心，因为现代社会中，危机会影响到所有人。
All must commit themselves to working together, because in modern societies crises affect everyone.
要面对任何危机，先要勇于承认我们个人可能会犯错，我们需要为了共同的利益而与其他人协作，即便这是一些我们不喜欢的人。
To face any crisis, we should be brave enough to admit that we may make mistakes personally, and we need to work with others for the common good, even if it is someone we don't like.
人是一种社会生物，这就是为什么我们需要缔结社会契约，而新冠病毒可能就是那个触发点。
Man is a social creature, which is why we need to conclude a social contract, and the new crown virus could be that trigger.
