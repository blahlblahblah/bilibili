这次旅行因新冠疫情而改变，留下的是人生中一次难忘的记忆，身在海外不能归家，发挥智慧，远程办公，与战斗在一线的同事们共同战“疫”，相信春天一定会到来。
The trip, which was shaped by the new crown, left an unforgettable memory of not being able to go home overseas, using intelligence, telecommuting, and working with colleagues on the front lines to fight the "plague," believing that spring will come.
文 | 李　莹鼠年春节，我的旅程因新冠疫情变得离奇。
At Rat & rsquo; s Spring Festival, my journey was bizarre with the new crown.
加勒比邮轮行，碧海蓝天、美食、海岛……张张美图直击心灵，经过2晚斗争，我和朋友终于拿下年三十去美国的机票，准备2月第一周登上梦想的邮轮。
Caribbean Cruise Line, Blue Sea Blue sky, Delicious food, Island... Zhang Mei Tut hit the heart, after 2 nights of struggle, my friends and I finally won the 30-year-old to the United States, ready to board the dream cruise in the first week of February.
2月2日的旧金山，阳光大好，出游的人不少　摄｜金华从浦东机场顺利登机飞到旧金山，心情晴朗，阳光大好，与朋友一起对这个五彩斑斓又略显老旧的城市进行了游览。
On February 2, San Francisco, the sun was shining brightly, and many tourists had boarded the plane from Pudong airport to San Francisco. The mood was clear, the sun was bright, and she joined her friends in a tour of the colorful and slightly old city.
年初五我们特意去唐人街，想体验一下土味年俗，却发现大多数商家没有营业，马路上冷冷清清，餐馆就餐的人也很少，连最著名的吃蟹的店也不需要排队，用餐间来取外卖的人倒是络绎不绝。
We made a point of going to Chinatown earlier this year to get a taste of the dirt, but found most were not open, the streets were deserted, restaurants were rarely served, even the most famous crab-eaters did not have to line up, and there was a steady stream of takeaway diners.
2月2日的旧金山，宁静的街道　摄｜金华到了2月1日，电台新闻里不断提及国内疫情升级，提醒入境不满14天的人应该要居家隔离，我们马上致电票务平台，回复说到：可能会有不让中国旅客登船的风险。
On Feb. 2, San Francisco, the quiet street took pictures. On February 1, the radio news kept mentioning the escalation of the epidemic in China, reminding people that people entering the country for less than 14 days should stay at home.
再加上游轮“钻石公主”号的感染人数不断上升的恐慌，考虑再三，我决定退票。
Coupled with the rising number of cases of infection from the cruise ship Princess Diamond, I decided to refund the ticket after much deliberation.
5日，国际邮轮协会发文，禁止来自中国或两周内曾踏足中国的旅客和船员登船。
On May 5, the International Cruise Association issued a letter forbidding passengers and crew members from China or who had set foot in China in two weeks to board the ship.
而此时突然传来消息，回程机票被取消了，转眼间我们变成了困兽。
Then suddenly came the news that the return ticket had been canceled, and in a moment we were left stranded.
我们一方面不断致电票务平台确认情况，咨询如何曲线回国；另一方面我们不断去美国的药店看有没有口罩，希望带回国给急缺物资的一线工作者。
On the one hand, we constantly call ticket counters to find out how to curve our way back home. On the other hand, we keep going to American pharmacies to see if there are any masks, hoping to take them home to front-line workers who are in urgent need of supplies.
我好不容易买到的口罩但事情进行得非常不顺利，从5日起，所有美国直航中国的飞机都被取消，如果要回国只能从第三国绕道，而第三国转机机场提示会有不让中国旅客登机的风险；二是即使登机到了第三国也需要过境签证，我们身份材料没有带足。
I managed to buy a mask, but things went badly wrong. From the 5th, all American direct flights to China were canceled. If I had to fly back, I had to take a detour from a third country.
如此一来滞留第三国的风险很大，只好等疫情好转看看再说。
The risk of staying in a third country is high and will have to wait until the situation improves.
而作为第一道防护的口罩在美也奇货可居，我们跑了药店、超市数次，货架空空如也，基本都张贴着“口罩售罄”的提示。
As the first line of protection of the mask in the United States is also wonderful, we ran pharmacies, supermarkets several times, empty shelves, basically posted "sold out of masks" signs.
最后我们利用手机翻译软件，和药店店员沟通了想法。
Finally, we used mobile translation software to communicate with drugstore clerks.
她表示口罩现在很难进到货，不过最近会来次货，可以帮我们预订一盒，按时来取。
She said the mask is hard to get in, but recently there will be a defective one. Please book a box for us to pick it up on time.
就这样，我们和这位菲律宾裔店员交上了朋友，终于等来了我们的第一盒口罩。
So we made friends with the Filipino shop assistant and finally waited for our first box of masks.
朋友购买了100只口罩，希望我带回中国此次到美国，我们借住在朋友家。
Friends bought 100 masks, hope I bring back to China this time to the United States, we live in the home of friends.
这位友人在美多年，平时对中国非常关注。
This friend has been in the United States for many years and usually pays close attention to China.
此次疫情成为我们交流的热点，从封城封村、封闭社区管理，到火神山医院建设、最美逆行者、各路志愿者的壮举，我们不断把新民周刊口述实录的文章拿出来阅读讨论，让友人深切感受到中华儿女在困难面前牺牲小我，整个国家都是武汉后盾的团结精神。
This epidemic situation has become the focus of our exchanges, from the closure of the village, closed community management, to the construction of the fire god mountain hospital, the most beautiful Reverse, the volunteers, we continue to put out the oral article of Xinmin Weekly to read and discuss, let friends deeply feel the Chinese people in the face of difficulties, the whole country is Wuhan backing the solidarity spirit.
一天，他下班带回来100只口罩，嘱咐我们带回中国，赠送给一线工作者。
One day, he returned from work with a hundred masks and told us to bring them back to China and give them to front-line workers.
这次旅行因新冠疫情而改变，留下的是人生中一次难忘的记忆，身在海外不能归家，发挥智慧，远程办公，与战斗在一线的同事们共同战“疫”，相信春天一定会到来。
The trip, which was shaped by the new crown, left an unforgettable memory of not being able to go home overseas, using intelligence, telecommuting, and working with colleagues on the front lines to fight the "plague," believing that spring will come.
