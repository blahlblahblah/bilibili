燃财经（ID:rancaijing）原创作者 | 黎明编辑 | 阿伦疫情对物流行业造成了巨大影响，货拉拉创始人兼CEO周胜馥称，疫情期间货拉拉的订单量下降了约80%，今年2月份的亏损金额高达1个亿，但他同时表示，“我们不会裁员，不会降薪。
Flaming Finance (ID: Rancaijing) Former creator and dawn editor & # 124; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & #
”2月25日，燃财经举办线上沙龙，货拉拉创始人兼CEO周胜馥、光源资本创始人兼CEO郑烜乐、阿里本地生活副总裁、蜂鸟即配业务负责人刘歆杨，分别进行了主题分享，并和燃财经总编辑贺树龙做了对话。
Founder and CEO Zhou Shengfu, founder and CEO of Light Source Capital, Chen Hsuan-Le, Vice President of Local Life Ali, and Din-shin Liu Xin, head of hummingbird operations, held a thematic discussion and held a dialogue with Heshulong, the chief financial editor of Fairfax.
•受疫情影响，货拉拉的订单量目前大概恢复了20%，今年2月份亏损1个亿，为史上最高，但货拉拉目前资金充足，而且不会裁员和降薪；•不允许公司只有三个月的现金，确保公司有造血能力，按超过一年的时间去准备充足的资金；•物流是把货物从A点运到B点的效率游戏，效率来自于人车货的信息化、在线化、智能化，谁能把物流的这三个关键要素做好，谁就会有优势；•企业的利润来自对社会创造价值的回收。
Lala orders are now about 20% higher than ever, a record loss of $100 million in February, but they are now well funded and do not cut jobs and wages; they are not allowed to have three months of cash, ensure their hematopoietic ability to prepare enough money for more than a year.
较少关注竞争对手，优先关注用户需求。
Focus less on competitors and prioritize user needs.
货拉拉的使命愿景和价值观不会变化；•过于追逐短期利益会对企业造成不利影响，货拉拉坚持长期主义，目前没有IPO计划，且希望十年之内不上市。
Lala's mission vision and values will not change; too much pursuit of short-term gains will adversely affect businesses, and cargo latecomers stick to a long-term approach, have no IPO plans at the moment, and want to stay out of the market for a decade.
以下是周胜馥在燃财经沙龙上的详细分享内容：疫情对货拉拉短期影响巨大，但长期一定会恢复可能很多人不知道，货拉拉是在香港创立的。
Here is Zhou Shengfu's detailed sharing at the Flaming Finance Salon: The epidemic is having a huge short-term impact on cargo Lala, but it is bound to recover in the long run.
之前我去内地的一些城市，很多新朋友都以为货拉拉是本地企业。
Before I went to some cities in the inland, many new friends thought the goods were local enterprises.
不仅在国内，有一次在菲律宾，当地人也以为我们是菲律宾的企业，这是一个挺有趣的现象。
Not only at home, but also once in the Philippines, the local people thought we were Filipino businesses, which is an interesting phenomenon.
货拉拉是做货运的，一开始做同城货运，现在除了同城货运还有跨城货运，另外我们也有做搬家、零担、企业版，其实汽车销售也有。
Lala is a freight, the first to do with the city freight, now in addition to freight and cross-city freight, we also have to do moving, carry, enterprise version, in fact there are car sales.
现在我们在国内覆盖了大概300座城市，海外覆盖了20来个城市，从东南亚到印度，包括美洲，都有货拉拉的业务。
Now we cover about 300 cities in China, 20 cities overseas, and lesbian businesses from Southeast Asia to India, including the Americas.
今年我们的目标还是会投不少精力在国际化上面。
Our goal this year will be to invest a lot of energy in internationalization.
疫情对物流的影响是巨大的，现在我们业务恢复了不到20%。
The impact of the epidemic on logistics has been enormous, and we are now recovering less than 20 per cent of our business.
而且什么时候能恢复到正常水平现在也难以判断。
And it is hard to tell when it will return to normal.
短期来看，疫情对我们的影响是巨大的，但中长期来看，我觉得只要中国经济恢复了，我们的业务肯定也能恢复。
In the short term, the impact on us is enormous, but in the medium to long term, I think that as long as the Chinese economy recovers, our business will certainly recover.
在具体影响上，货拉拉是一个连接供需两边的平台，疫情对供给端的影响是最大的，因为有交通管制，以及很多司机无法复工，现在我们的供给端恢复了大约20%。
In terms of impact, the cargo lala is a platform that links supply and demand, with the epidemic having the greatest impact on the supply side, because of traffic control and the inability of many drivers to return to work, and now our supply side has recovered by about 20 per cent.
在用户端，无论是C端的搬家需求，还是B端的运力需求，我们都能看到需求下降了很多。
On the client side, we see a much lower demand for both C-side moving demand and B-side capacity demand.
因为无论是中小企业还是大型企业，受制于无法复工，没有生产就肯定没有运力需求。
Because no matter small and medium-sized enterprises or large enterprises, subject to the inability to resume work, there is certainly no demand for capacity.
这当然也会影响到我们的同事。
This, of course, also affects our colleagues.
货拉拉是一个O2O平台，除了线上的运作，我们有很多事情还要通过线下的运营去完成，所以员工能否如期到岗对我们的企业恢复也很重要。
Lala is an O2O platform, in addition to online operations, we have a lot of things to do through offline operations, so whether employees can be on time is also important to our business recovery.
在给员工安全、安心的复工，以及对员工的安全教育方面，我们也做了不少工作。
We have also done a lot of work to give our employees a safe and secure return to work, as well as to educate our employees about safety.
我们算是一个比较居安思危的企业，在好景的时候，在阳光比较灿烂的时候，我们已经完成了几轮融资，所以在资金方面我们是没有困难的。
We are a relatively safe business, in good times, the sun is more brilliant, we have completed several rounds of financing, so we do not have financial difficulties.
这几年大部分企业都可能面临裁员和降薪的压力，但我们既不会裁员，也不会降薪。
Most companies are likely to face layoffs and pay cuts in recent years, but we won't lay off workers or cut them.
我们是这样看物流行业的。
This is the way we look at the logistics industry.
物流其实就是把货物从A点运到B点的效率游戏，谁能把效率做好，就谁有机会。
Logistics is the efficiency game of moving goods from point A to point B, who can do the efficiency well, who has the opportunity.
效率来自于货物的信息化。
Efficiency comes from the informatization of goods.
其实在整个物流里，重要角色就是司机、车、货物。
In fact, in the whole logistics, the important role is the driver, the car, the cargo.
所以我们从人车货的角度能做到的就是“三化”——信息化、在线化、智能化，谁能把物流的这三个关键要素做好，谁就会有优势。
So what we can do from the perspective of people and cargoes is "three-way" - information, online, intelligent, who can do these three key elements of logistics, who will have the advantage.
从用户的角度，比如有时候你在打车的时候会考虑一个问题，就是我的货物究竟是需要一个小面，还是需要一个中面。
From the user's point of view, for example, sometimes when you take a taxi, you wonder if my product needs a small side or a medium side.
我们希望能通过一些AR和深度识别的技术，让用户只用拍个照，然后我们就会告诉他这个货物用多大的车去装就可以了。
We hope that with a few AR and depth recognition techniques, the user can just take a photo, and then we'll tell him how much it costs to load it.
所以在信息化方面，我们是希望持续投入的。
So in information technology, we hope to continue to invest.
还有一些场景，比如在高峰时间段，车的运力是不够的，那这个时候我们可以通过一些运筹优化的技术，把一些相似的订单做成拼货。
There are also scenarios where, for example, the capacity of the car is not sufficient during peak periods, when we can combine similar orders using a number of operational optimization techniques.
另外，在车的信息化方面，严格来说现在我们只知道司机是在线的，但车辆还没有做信息化，所以接下来我们也希望通过一些IoT的设备，把整个物流的链路做到信息化和在线化。
In addition, in terms of information, strictly speaking, we only know that the driver is online, but the vehicle is not yet computerized, so we also hope to use some IoT devices to make the whole logistics link information and online.
从宏观来看，中国的物流成本占GDP的13%-14%左右，但在一个比较发达的国家，物流成本可以通过效率的提升降到10%以下。
At the macro level, logistics costs in China account for about 13 - 14 per cent of GDP, but in a more developed country, logistics costs can be reduced to less than 10 per cent through efficiency gains.
所以我们中长期还是很看好物流效率提升的空间。
So we still look forward to the long-term logistics efficiency improvement space.
当然短期的压力还是挺大的，比如说，这个月我们就还是亏钱的，而且亏损金额也是我们公司历史上最高的。
Of course, short-term pressure is quite big, for example, this month we still lose money, and the amount of loss is the highest in the history of our company.
对话周胜馥：不允许公司只有三个月的现金燃财经：此前有报道称，货拉拉的业务量在春节和疫情期间下降了93%，最近有所恢复吗？你预计什么时间能恢复到正常水平？周胜馥：我们到昨天大概恢复了20%左右，所以大概就是下降了80%。
Dialogue Zhou Shengfu: Companies are not allowed to have only three months' cash to burn business: Have you recently recovered from the 93% decline reported during the Spring Festival and the epidemic?
具体什么时候恢复其实还是要看中国的经济什么时候恢复，因为我们的业务无论是从C端需求，还是B端中小企业或大企业的需求，都是跟中国经济挂钩的，而且我们覆盖的范围和行业也比较多，所以最大的变量还是中国的经济。
It really depends on when the Chinese economy recovers, because our business is tied to the Chinese economy, whether it's C-side demand or B-side SME or large-scale enterprise demand, and we cover more areas and industries, so the biggest variable is China's economy.
燃财经：货拉拉这个月的亏损是历史上最多的，具体多少？周胜馥：一个亿。
Caijing: goods Lala this month is the largest loss in history, how much specific? Zhou Shengfu: a billion.
不过我们不会裁员，不会降薪。
But we won't lay off people, we won't cut pay.
燃财经：一个亿不少了，具体的亏损来自哪些方面，成本结构大概是怎样的？周胜馥：具体的成本结构我就不说了，因为二月份我们业务总体下跌了90%以上，所以收入最后肯定也下跌得比较厉害，但是像员工和房租这类的支出并不会降下来。
(Chew) Zhou Shengfu: I will not say the exact cost structure, because our business overall fell by more than 90% in February, so the final income will certainly fall more, but such expenses as staff and rent will not come down.
另外我们还是中长期看好，一些扩张的业务没有停下来。
In addition, we are optimistic in the medium and long term, some expansion of the business has not stopped.
所以就导致二月份的亏损也不少。
So it led to a loss in February.
燃财经：刚才你说，货拉拉账上的现金储备比较多，所以短期内没有现金流压力。
Finance: Just now you said that the goods Lala account of more cash reserves, so there is no short-term cash flow pressure.
那货拉拉有没有做一些开源节流的工作？如果账上的现金只够用3个月，你会做什么？周胜馥：疫情发生之前，我们的看法是，应该用的钱就用，不应该用的钱就不用。
If we only had enough cash on the books for three months, what would you do? Zhou Shengfu: Before the outbreak, our opinion was that money should be used instead of money that should not be used.
疫情发生后，我们觉得疫情总要过去，所以我们现在更多是在为疫情过去之后要做的事情做准备。
After the outbreak, we felt the epidemic was going to be over, so we are now more ready to do what we need to do after the epidemic is over.
比如今年我们要在国际化方面更加激进，国内也会落地更多城市，我们在做人才储备，所以就不可能在节流上做很多事情。
This year, for example, we are going to be more aggressive in internationalizing, we are going to land more cities at home, we are building a pool of talent, so it is impossible to do a lot of things in economizing.
其实短期内我们会有很多额外开支，比如运力有问题，我们需要对司机侧多做一些活动，会在短期内加大开支。
In fact, in the short term we will have a lot of extra expenses, such as capacity problems, we need to do more activities to the driver side, will increase the cost in the short term.
我们的投资方光源资本帮我们融了好几期资金，所以我们才能在比较困难的时候，去做一些更长远的准备。
Our investment source capital helps us to finance several periods of capital, so we can in difficult times, to do some longer-term preparation.
如果我只有三个月的现金，那就比较困难了。
If I had only three months of cash, that would be difficult.
其实我们曾经出现过只有一个月资金的时候。
In fact, we have had only a month of funds.
但那次最后还是比较幸运，在最后一刻融到了钱。
But in the end it was lucky to get the money at the last minute.
所以自从那次以后，我就确保两个事情，一是我们自己有造血能力，至少在现金流上需要很健康；二是我们要永远有足够的资金，不仅是三个月，而是要按超过一年去计算，我是不允许公司只有三个月的现金的。
So since then, I've made sure that we have the hematopoietic ability, at least in terms of cash flow, and that we always have enough capital, not just for three months, but for more than a year.
燃财经：上面说到账上只有1个月现金大概是什么时候？当时内心是什么感受？周胜馥：这个还好，我觉得我在面对风浪或者危机的时候，知道哪些是自己可以控制的，哪些是自己不能控制的。
Caijing: When did it say that there was only one month's cash on my account? How did I feel at that time? Zhou Shengfu: Well, I think I know what I can control and what I can't control in the face of a storm or crisis.
比如这次疫情，我觉得不能控制的因素就是，我不知道疫情什么时候结束，疫情具体对中国经济产生多大影响。
For example, this outbreak, I feel unable to control the factors is that I do not know when the end of the epidemic, the specific impact of the epidemic on the Chinese economy.
另外，能不能拿到投资我是控制不了的。
Besides, I can't control whether I can get an investment or not.
我能控制的是，尽力去见更多人，找到相信货拉拉的人。
What I can control is trying to meet more people and find people who believe in lesbians.
至于那些不能控制的，我就不用担心了，可以控制的就尽心尽力去做好。
As for the uncontrollable, I don't have to worry about it. I can control it and do it well.
物流行业的痛点和机遇人车货的信息化、在线化和智能化燃财经：货拉拉在疫情期间做了很多有意义的工作，在这些事情上花费了多少精力和资源？动力是什么？周胜馥：我们在1月26日就开通了绿色通道，做一些公益性质的运输，也是为武汉做一点贡献。
Logistics industry pain points and opportunities for information, online and intelligent fuel economy: cargo Lala during the epidemic did a lot of meaningful work, how much energy and resources on these things? Motivation? Zhou Shengfu: We opened a green channel on January 26, do some public welfare transportation, also for Wuhan to do a little contribution.
我们在武汉召集了近100个爱心志愿司机，他们承担了超过200次的公益运输，运输一些口罩和医疗用品。
We assembled nearly 100 caring volunteer drivers in Wuhan, who undertook more than 200 pro bono trips to transport masks and medical supplies.
其实不仅在武汉，武汉周边省份也有这方面的需求。
In fact, not only in Wuhan, Wuhan surrounding provinces also have this need.
比如建立火神山医院的时候，我们有一些司机是从成都将物资运到火神山。
For example, when we built the Mount Fire Hospital, some of our drivers transported supplies from Chengdu to Mount Fire.
没有货拉拉司机，其实就没有货拉拉，因为他们始终是最终的运力提供者。
Lala drivers without goods, in fact, there is no Labrador, because they are always the ultimate provider of capacity.
燃财经：疫情期间，以顺丰、京东到家、盒马、每日优鲜、饿了么、美团为代表的企业，物流配送环节自营可控，收获了很好的用户口碑，但是一些平台型电商网站和物流快递企业表现十分乏力，你认为，原因是什么？带给大家的启示是什么？周胜馥：自营和平台模式，我觉得各有优劣。
During the epidemic period, with Shunfeng, Jingdong home, box horse, daily excellent, hungry, the United States Mission as the representative of the enterprise, logistics distribution chain self-control, harvest very poor performance, but some platform-based e-commerce websites and logistics express enterprises, what do you think?
自营的控制力和稳定性要强一些，有些特殊场景会突出这个模式的优点。
Self-control and stability are stronger, and some special scenarios highlight the benefits of this model.
平台型企业的灵活性要强一些。
Platforms are more flexible.
所以我觉得是各有优劣，在不同的场景会突出不同模式的优点和缺点。
So I think each has its own advantages and disadvantages, in different scenarios will highlight the advantages and disadvantages of different models.
燃财经：在你看来，物流货运行业还有什么痛点没解决？这里面藏着哪些创新的机会？周胜馥：物流行业很大，具体痛点要看细分领域。
Flaming Finance: In your opinion, what is the pain of the logistics freight industry? What are the opportunities for innovation? Zhou Shengfu: The logistics industry is very large, the specific pain point depends on the subdivision.
不同距离代表着不同市场，比如同城三公里还是同城二十公里的配送，支线、干线还是国际配送。
Distance represents different markets, such as three kilometers with the city or twenty kilometers of distribution, feeder lines, trunk lines or international distribution.
不同时效也是不同市场，即时、当日达、次日达，以及计划性需求。
Different aging is also different markets, instant, day, day, day, and planning needs.
运输的规则也是不同需求，整车和拼车都是不一样的。
Transportation rules are also different needs, the whole car and carpool are not the same.
无论从距离还是时效来看，都可以将物流行业分割出不同的市场。
No matter from the distance or the time limit, can divide the logistics industry out of the different markets.
但是整个物流行业的痛点，我觉得还是司机、车、货物的信息化、在线化、智能化的整个改善的过程。
But the pain of the whole logistics industry, I think the driver, car, cargo information, online, intelligent the whole process of improvement.
所以能在这三个要素里面去做改善的，就是物流行业的机会。
So can do in these three elements to improve, is the logistics industry opportunities.
燃财经：疫情期间，无接触的概念比较火，你认为这会加速物流行业与人工智能的结合吗？货拉拉在这方面有哪些尝试？周胜馥：是的，我们的人工智能应用也是围绕着人车货的信息化、在线化、智能化去做的。
What do you think will accelerate the integration of logistics industry and artificial intelligence? Zhou Shengfu: Yes, our artificial intelligence application also revolves around the informatization, on-line and intelligentization of human and car cargo.
比如，这一堆货，我们究竟是应该用小面还是中面去运输，如果我们能通过手机拍照，通过一些算法测出货物的体积，能不能实时知道车里面还有多少载重空间，这其实已经在运用很多人工智能的算法了。
For example, if we can take pictures by mobile phone, measure the volume of cargo by some algorithms, and know how much load space is still in the car, we are already using artificial intelligence algorithms.
坚持长期主义希望十年内不上市燃财经：当前阶段，货运物流平台之间竞争的焦点是什么？和快狗速运、蓝犀牛等对手相比，货拉拉有什么优劣势？周胜馥：我们从以前到现在，都是比较少关注竞争对手的，因为我们觉得，我们存在的理由是我们的客户，所以我们的用户关注的东西，就是我们要优先关注的。
What are the strengths and weaknesses of freight forwarders versus fast-moving, blue rhinoceros and the like? Zhou Shengfu: We've always paid less attention to our competitors because we think our raison d'être is our customers, so what our users care about is our priority.
至于我们的对手在做什么，其实我们关注的比较少。
As for what our opponents are doing, we pay less attention to it.
燃财经：对你个人而言，疫情带来了哪些认知上的变化？周胜馥：我最深刻的体会就是，贝索斯有一句话，“究竟什么东西是十年不变”。
Flaming Finance: What cognitive changes has the epidemic brought about for you personally? Zhou Shengfu: My deepest experience is that Bezos has said, "What exactly is the same for 10 years?"
世界肯定会有很多变化，有时候是好的，有时候不好的，比如说像这次疫情，但是我觉得更重要的是反问自己，做这个企业有哪些东西是不变的？我觉得这是这次疫情对我最大的认知变化。
The world is bound to change a lot, sometimes good, sometimes bad, like this epidemic, but I think it's more important to ask yourself, what's the same about doing this business? I think it's the biggest change in my perception of the epidemic.
燃财经：做企业哪些东西是不变的？你自己的答案是什么？周胜馥：我认为企业的利润来自对社会创造价值的回收。
Flaming Finance: What is the same thing about doing business? What is your answer? Zhou Shengfu: I think the profits of enterprises come from the recovery of value created by society.
经常反问一下自己，究竟为世界创造了什么价值？我们对用户、司机、员工的价值是不变的。
Always ask yourself what value you have created for the world. Our value to users, drivers, and employees remains the same.
对用户来说，货拉拉最大的价值就是“有快好”，有就是能找到车，快就是能快速找到车，而且从叫到车到门口的时间可以做到十分钟以内，好就是通过司机提供很好的物流服务。
To the user, the biggest value of the Labrador is "have fast good", is to find a car, fast is to find a car, and the time from call to the door can be within 10 minutes, good through the driver to provide good logistics.
货拉拉对司机的价值就是有钱有面有自由，对员工的价值就是有成长有未来有舞台。
The value of a lesbian to a driver is freedom with money, and value to an employee is growth with a future.
然后每个做得好的企业也会有一些比较一致的使命愿景价值观，这是整个公司的人都认可的，所以我觉得货拉拉的使命愿景价值观也是不变的。
Then every well-done company has some consistent mission vision values that everyone in the company agrees with, so I think the values of the mission vision of the cargo lesbians are the same.
燃财经：创立货拉拉之前，你做过咨询，带领货拉拉发展的心路历程与之前的经历有哪些相通之处？又有哪些新的收获和感悟？周胜馥：就能力来说，我觉得我之前的经历跟我现在做的企业是没有什么相同之处的。
Flaming Finance: Before you started a lesbian, what do you think is the similarities between your counseling and previous experiences? And what are some new gains and insights? Zhou Shengfu: As far as ability is concerned, I don't think my previous experience is the same as the one I'm doing.
我最大的收获是，那一段时间磨练的一些价值观，比如激情、谦卑、坚毅、执行，其实都是那个时候培养出来的。
What I have learned most is that some of the values that were honed during that time, such as passion, humility, perseverance and execution, were actually developed at that time.
燃财经：有人提到行业烧钱和刷单的问题，货拉拉现在的补贴还像以前一样高吗？如何防止司机刷单？周胜馥：其实我们的补贴是比较少的，国内刷单问题不大，我们的部分海外业务有刷单问题。
Flaming Finance: Some people mentioned that the industry burning money and brush bills, goods Lala is still as high as before? How to prevent the driver from paying the bill? Zhou Shengfu: Actually our subsidies are relatively small, domestic billing problems are small, some of our overseas businesses have billing problems.
当然我们有一个技术团队是负责做风控的，所以刷单这个问题其实是可以通过技术手段去解决的。
Of course we have a technical team responsible for wind control, so the problem of billing can be solved through technical means.
燃财经：货拉拉的盈利状况如何？什么时候能够整体盈利？长远来看，商业化的主要方式有哪些？周胜馥：盈利状况我还是不说了，因为现在的预估也是毛估，所以我还是保守一点，什么时候盈利我就什么时候给大家汇报。
Flaming Finance: What is the profit status of the goods Lala? When can we be profitable as a whole? In the long run, what are the main ways to commercialize it? Zhou Shengfu: Profitability is still a foregone conclusion.
在商业模式变现方面，目前我们还是主要靠司机的会员费作为商业化的手段。
In terms of business model realization, we still rely mainly on the driver's membership fees as a means of commercialization.
燃财经：货拉拉有IPO计划吗？周胜馥：说实话，我们是没有IPO计划的。
Caijing: Is there an IPO plan for Lala? Zhou Shengfu: To be honest, we have no IPO plan.
我经常跟我们同事和投资者说，我们是希望十年以内不要IPO的。
I often tell my colleagues and investors that we want an IPO within 10 years.
因为一个企业或者一个人是不是长期主义，我觉得这个很重要。
Because a company or a person is not a long-term doctrine, I think this is very important.
过于追逐短期利益其实会影响企业的，同事的心态也会影响企业的行为。
Too much pursuit of short-term benefits will actually affect the enterprise, the attitude of colleagues will also affect the behavior of enterprises.
所以我一直以来就灌输一个概念，我们希望是做一个长期的事情，我们希望十年之内不上市。
So I have been instilling the concept that we want to do a long-term thing, we hope not to go public within 10 years.
