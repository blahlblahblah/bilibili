食物、药品、物资、服务……钻石公主号乘客与船员在通过社交网络向外呼救。
Food, medicine, supplies, services... Passengers and crew of the Princess Diamond are calling out through social networks.
每个人、每一方，在这起事件中，都有自己的诉求与立场。
Everyone, each side, in this incident, has their own claims and positions.

# 与以往灾难应对方式不同，被隔离的乘客们运用网络，形成了互助组织。
# Unlike previous disaster response, isolated passengers have used networks to form mutual aid groups.
# 无法进入现场的媒体成为“被利用者”。
# The media without access to the scene become "exploited."
乘客们通过各种技术方式播报“新闻”，他们甚至已经学会利用媒体完成监督、实现诉求。
Passengers, who broadcast the "news" in a variety of technical ways, have even learned to use the media to monitor and enforce their claims.

2 月 13 日，爆发疫情的豪华邮轮钻石公主号上，还有大约 3000 人没有接受病毒检测。
On February 13, about 3,000 people were not tested for the virus on board the luxury liner Princess Cruise Diamonds, which broke out.
已经有 217 人与 1 名检疫官确诊，还有大约 3400 人被封在船上。
Two hundred and seventeen people have been diagnosed with a quarantine officer, and about 3,400 people are being held on board.
这艘搭载着 3711 人的邮轮从日本横滨出发，途经鹿儿岛、香港、越南岘港和丐冷、基隆、那霸，计划最终于 2 月 4 日返回横滨。
The 3, 711-person liner set sail from Yokohama, Japan, via Kagoshima, Hong Kong, Danang, Vietnam, and Calcutta, Keelung and Naga before finally returning to Yokohama on February 4.
事情却在途中发生了变化。
Things changed along the way.
1 月 30 日之后，乘客们逐渐发现，他们下不了船了。
After January 30, passengers gradually realized that they could not get off the ship.
△ 2 月 6 日，钻石公主号邮轮停泊在日本横滨港。
On February 6, the Princess Diamond docked at Yokohama, Japan.
图片来源 | 美联社日本厚生劳动省（类似于我们理解中的“卫生部”）于 2 月 5 日确认，邮轮最初 31 个疑似病例中，已有 10 名乘客确诊新型冠状病毒引发的肺炎，所有人都不能上岸，必须在船上隔离 14 天。
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (similar to what we understand to be the Ministry of Health) confirmed on February 5 that 10 of the original 31 suspected cases of coronavirus-induced pneumonia had been confirmed by 10 passengers, all of whom could not disembark and had to be quarantined on board for 14 days.
诱发传染连锁的是一位曾在船上逗留 5 天的 80 岁老人，尽管他已于 1 月 25 日结束旅程下船，但考虑到海上邮轮的封闭性，情况不容乐观。
The contagion chain was triggered by an 80-year-old man who had been on board for five days, and although he had left the ship on 25 January, given the closed nature of the sea liner, the situation was not encouraging.
钻石公主号由美国嘉年华集团（Carnival Corporation & plc）旗下邮轮公司“公主邮轮”（Princess Cruises）运营，拥有 5 种舱位，分别是内舱、海景舱、阳台舱、迷你套房舱和套房舱。
The Princess Diamond is operated by Princess Cruises, a cruise company owned by Carnival Corporation and plc, and has five classes of cabin, sea view, balcony, mini suites and suites.
其中，没有窗户、狭小的内舱占到总客舱数量的 1/3，另一些客房的观景窗嵌入舱体，无法打开。
Of these, the windowless, cramped interior accounts for one-third of the total passenger cabin population, while others have viewing windows embedded in the cabin and cannot be opened.

图片来源 | 美联社许多乘客紧张之余，也有些不知所措。
Many passengers at the Associated Press were at a loss as well as nervous.
在网络通畅的情况下，有人选择了通过社交媒体向外界呼救。
With the network open, someone chose to call out to the outside world through social media.
本来，在邮轮内上网是收费服务。
Originally, Internet access within a cruise ship was a fee-paying service.
邮轮内发生疫情后，钻石公主号邮轮向乘客们开放了免费网络服务。
Following the outbreak of the disease on board the cruise ship, the Princess Diamond opened its free web service to passengers.
到目前为止，大卫・阿贝尔（David Abel）可能是这艘邮轮上最受媒体关注的“明星乘客”。
So far, David Abel has probably been the most watched "star passenger" on the cruise.
他是一名来自英国的婚礼策划师，此次登船是为了与妻子萨莉（Sally）一起庆祝结婚 50 周年。
He is a British wedding planner who boarded to celebrate his 50th wedding anniversary with his wife, Sally.
自 2 月 4 日起，他开始在 Facebook 定时直播船上情况、答疑解惑，并请求观众帮忙分享视频。
Since February 4, he has been broadcasting the boat live on Facebook regularly, answering questions and asking viewers to help share the video.
截至 2 月 13 日，他一共发布了 50 部视频，总播放量逾 85 万。
As at 13 February, he had released 50 videos with a total broadcast volume of more than 850,000.
早在 1 月 30 日，大卫就试图用 Facebook 给家人报平安。
As early as January 30, David tried to give his family peace on Facebook.
他察觉到船内气氛紧张——船员们采取了各种卫生措施，包括测体温、宣传餐前洗手、禁止使用公共厕所、要求乘客签署“戴口罩协议”等。
He sensed tension in the boat - the crew took a variety of hygiene measures, including temperature tests, publicity about washing hands before meals, banning the use of public toilets, and requiring passengers to sign the mask-wearing protocol.
不过，大卫与妻子从没想到，病毒离他们这么近。
But David and his wife never thought the virus was so close to them.
2 月 1 日从冲绳入境日本时，他们发现那里设了体温检查关卡，岸上旅行也全部取消了。
When they entered Japan from Okinawa on February 1, they found a temperature check post there and all shore trips were cancelled.
直到两天后，大卫在 Facebook 上说：“我今天早上才知道，有超过 300 名乘客从中国香港登船，其中一人已确诊感染新冠肺炎。
"I only learned this morning that more than 300 passengers had boarded the ship from Hong Kong, China, and one of them had been diagnosed with pneumonia," David said on Facebook two days later.
”大卫不得不取消了归国的机票。
David had to cancel his return ticket.
两天后的深夜，一段船长广播打破了寂静。
Late at night two days later, the silence was broken by a captain's broadcast.
船长告知所有人，日本医护人员将登船，为每位乘客测量体温。
The captain told everyone that the Japanese paramedics would board the ship and take the temperature of every passenger.
△ 穿着防护服的医护人员从钻石公主号离开。

图片来源 | 路透社但是这个“初筛”也有争议。
But the "sieve" is also controversial.
日本厚生劳动省大臣加藤胜信在 2 月 10 日的记者会上表示，他们没有给船上所有人做核酸检测。
At a news conference on Feb. 10, Japan's Health, Labour and Welfare Minister Shinzo Kato said they had not tested all the ship's nucleic acids.
日本多家媒体在报道中表示，现在公布的确诊病例都是来自被判断为有发热等症状的人以及与他们有关的“密切接触者”。
A number of Japanese media have reported that the confirmed cases have come from people judged to have fever and other symptoms, as well as "close contacts" associated with them.
一些医学界人士质疑，“密切接触者”并非严格医学定义。
Some in the medical community question whether "close contact" is strictly a medical definition.
这个称谓多次出现在日本厚生劳动省在针对流行性疾病的防控指导纲领中。
The term has appeared repeatedly in the guiding program of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare against epidemic diseases.
在 2007 年 1 月厚生劳动省针对当年新型流感的一份指导文件中，“密切接触者”包括同居者、实施救助的医护人员、污染物质接触者以及直接面对面接触者。
In a guidance document issued by the MHLW in January 2007 on the new influenza of the year, "close contacts" include cohabitants, health-care workers carrying out rescue operations, those who come into contact with pollutants and those who come into direct face-to-face contact.
但目前针对邮轮上的人，这个“筛网”还是有太多漏洞。
But there are still too many holes in the screen for cruise passengers.
一名日本乘客在接受日本电视台采访时表示，他们只“填了一张健康问询表”，然后两名检疫人员上船为他测量了体温。
In an interview with Japanese television, a Japanese passenger said they had only "filled out a health questionnaire" and then two quarantine officers boarded the vessel to take his temperature.
根据中国的防控与检疫经验，还有很多无症状者最终在核酸检测中显示为阳性。
According to China's control and quarantine experience, many asymptomatic people end up being tested positive for nucleic acid.
△ 2 月 4 日上午，检疫官在船舱八楼检疫。
On the morning of February 4, the quarantine officer quarantine on the eighth floor of the ship's cabin.

Apparently, some problems occurred on board RV Twitter @ daxa _ tw.
一条发布于 2 月 5 日的求助视频让大卫获得公众关注。
David gained public attention with a help video released Feb. 5.
在视频中，他表示自己与妻子已经超过 14 个小时没有获得食物，作为一名糖尿病患者，他随时有可能陷入休克。
In the video, he said he and his wife had not been fed for more than 14 hours and that as a diabetic, he was at risk of going into shock.
“我只想知道到底发生了什么！任何正在关注这件事的记者，请给乘客们带些消息来，我会非常非常感激。
"I just want to know what's going on! Any journalist who is following this matter, please bring some information to the passengers. I would be very grateful."
”视频结尾，大卫说道。
"David said at the end of the video.
很快，就有超过 5 万人看过这段信息，有多人设法替他联系运营公司。
Soon, more than 50,000 people read the message, and many managed to contact the company for him.
当时，因为病毒来源还未确定，日本厚生劳动省最初怀疑病毒来源是食物。
At the time, the ministry initially suspected the source of the virus was food because the source of the virus had not been determined.
此外，船上的人实在太多，检疫的进度远比他们设想的更为缓慢。
Besides, there were so many people on board that the quarantine was much slower than they thought.
不过大卫的事情很快得到了解决。
But David's case was quickly resolved.
中午 12 点左右，大卫夫妇拿到了餐点——酸奶、橙汁和切成小块的蜜瓜，大卫不仅患有糖尿病，而且乳糖不耐，随后船员又给他捎来面包卷和黄油。
At around 12: 00 noon the David and his wife were served yoghurt, orange juice and chopped melons, and David suffered not only from diabetes but also from lactose, which was followed by rolls and butter.
大卫是率先在社交媒体上曝光船内情况的乘客之一，加上乐观健谈的态度与时不时蹦出来的玩笑话，让他获得了多方关注。
David was one of the first to expose the boat on social media, and his optimistic attitude and occasional gaffes earned him a lot of attention.
他在直播中表示，已有来自美国、英国、澳大利亚、日本、中国、新西兰的数十家新闻媒体联系他，他接受了英国《每日邮报》、天空电视台、ITV、BBC 等媒体的采访，公主邮轮公司的管理层也找上了他。
He said he had been contacted by dozens of news outlets in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, China and New Zealand, and he had been interviewed by the Daily Mail, Sky Television, ITV, BBC and other media outlets, as well as by the management of Princess Cruise.
各类新闻网站是隔离期间乘客们的头号信息源，他们会在社交媒体上交换、传播信息。
News sites of all kinds are a prime source of information for passengers during periods of isolation, exchanging and disseminating information on social media.
大卫在 Facebook 创建了一个“隔离中的公主号乘客”小组用于交换信息，并禁止媒体访问。
David created a group of "Princess in Isolation" passengers on Facebook to exchange information and block media access.
截至 2 月 12 日，共有 93 名成员。
As at 12 February, there were 93 members.
“好像只有我们被蒙在鼓里，”他回忆道，“隔离刚开始不久的时候，一名乘客发消息告诉我，他的国家的新闻里说已经有确诊病例了，我们才知道发生了什么。
"It was as if we were alone," he recalls. "Shortly after the quarantine began, a passenger sent me news that confirmed cases had been reported in the news in his country before we knew what had happened.
”最新情况、食物供应、药品储备、内舱乘客都是网友关心的问题。
The latest news, food supplies, drug stockpiles and cabin passengers are among the concerns of netizens.
大卫在 2 月 6 日的视频中更新说，三餐已恢复定时供应；在医护人员的监视下，乘客们可轮流到甲板上活动 90 分钟——甲板很长，他们便循着长廊吹风、来回转圈。
David updated in a Feb. 6 video that three meals had been restored to regular service and that under the watchful of paramedics, passengers could take turns on deck for 90 minutes - the deck was long and they followed the corridor to blow and turn back and forth.
另一名日本乘客也表示，乘客们可以轮流到甲板上透气，轮一次大约需要 3 天。
Another Japanese passenger said the passengers could take turns to get air on deck, which would take about three days at a time.

Twitter @ daxa _ tw But the princess is not in charge of quarantine, and all data about pneumonia must be released by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.
2 月 7 日，大卫拿到了厚生劳动省提供的口罩，这是他在游轮上拿到的第一个口罩。
On February 7, David received a mask from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, the first one he got on a cruise ship.
药可能也不够了。
Drugs may not be enough.
然而拿到药品却并不是一件容易的事情。
Getting medicine, however, is not easy.
一名 Twitter 账户名为 @nsk061608 的日本乘客试图通过 Twitter 求助——她的目的非常明确，甚至不会回答任何其他问题——她拿到自己需要的治疗慢性疾病的药品，花了 5 天的时间。
A Japanese passenger with a Twitter account called @ nsk061608 tried to get help via Twitter - her aim was so clear that she would not even answer any other questions - and it took her five days to get the medicine she needed to treat her chronic illness.
她曾打电话给日本厚生劳动省，被推给了邮轮医务室，再联络前台，却得知医务室已优先将药品供应给了中老年乘客。
She called Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, was pushed to the cruise clinic and contacted the front desk, only to learn that the infirmary had given priority to the supply of drugs to middle-aged and elderly passengers.
她递交了两次药品申请，终于在再次发 Twitter 求援之后，收到了 14 天剂量的药。
She filed two drug applications and was finally given 14 doses of the drug after she repeated her Twitter request.
另一名 54 岁的日本乘客在接受日本《朝日新闻》采访时表示，她发烧 38.5 摄氏度，也有关节痛、流感等症状，预约船上医务室看诊后，等了3个多小时，得到了治疗流感的感冒药。
Another 54-year-old Japanese passenger told the Asahi Shimbun newspaper that she had a fever of 38.5 degrees Celsius, as well as joint pain and flu symptoms.
她担心自己被感染，但医务室以“并非紧急状况”拒绝了她的病毒检测申请。
She feared she was infected, but the infirmary refused her request for a virus test "not as an emergency."
2 月 8 日，邮轮停靠横滨大黑码头，除烟酒与电器制品外，外界可向乘客邮寄物资，或自行上交至码头接待处。
On February 8, the vessel docked at the Yokohama Grand Black Wharf. Apart from alcohol, tobacco and electrical products, passengers can be mailed or handed over to the dockside reception on their own.
药品需经医疗人员的二次检查，其余物品在接待处接受检查后，便可上船。
The medicines are subject to a second examination by a medical officer, and the rest, after being examined at the reception desk, are allowed on board.
这艘邮轮平时一直停泊在横滨港，但分别于 2 月 5 日及 8 日两次驶向公海，目的是通过蒸馏海水补充水资源，厚生劳动省派出直升机及船艇跟随。
The vessel, which normally docked at Yokohama port, made two voyages to the high seas on February 5 and 8 to replenish its water resources by distilling seawater. The Ministry of Health, Welfare and Labour dispatched helicopters and boats to follow.

图片来源 | Gay & Phil Courter向外界发声的乘客大多有自己的诉求，包括大卫。

他曾有四个要求：一是信息公开透明化，不想再从新闻网站上获取二手情报；二是想确定随着确诊病患增多，隔离期是否会不断延长；三是他认为厚生劳动省的应对不完善，过去一周他们曾经历一段“空窗期”——没有健康检查，没有例行提问，不清楚医护人员如何监控船上两千多名乘客的状况；四是他想与英国内政部（Home Office）取得联系，获悉归国后的安排，包括自己与家人是否还需要自主隔离两周。
He had four demands: transparency in the disclosure of information, no longer seeking secondary information from news sites; a desire to determine whether the isolation period would be prolonged as the number of diagnosed patients increased; a "blank window" over the past week - no health checks, no routine questions, no understanding of how health care workers monitored more than 2,000 passengers; and two weeks of home leave.
截至 2 月 13 日，英国内政部和日本厚生劳动省都还没有理他。
As of February 13, the Home Office and Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare had left him alone.
美国乘客凯瑟琳・柯卡丝（Katherine Codekas）和朋友已在 2 月 4 日决定，取消继续前往上海旅行的计划，改为从日本直接返回美国。
U.S. passenger Katherine Codekas and her friends decided on February 4 to cancel their plans to continue their trip to Shanghai and return directly to the United States from Japan.
真正让她感到慌张是在得知自己要被隔离时。
The real panic she felt was when she knew she was going to be quarantined.
“我意识到我们将被困在船上，这个舱房将成为我们接下去两周的家。
"I realized we were going to be stuck on the ship and this cabin was going to be our home for the next two weeks.
”她跟朋友随即取消了原定的归国计划，他们知道，至少接下去的两周内，他们无法回家。
She and her friends then cancelled their planned return home knowing they would not be able to do so for at least the next two weeks.
更让凯瑟琳焦虑和不满的是，他们不知道 14 天后，是否只要没有感染的症状，就能被解除隔离回家。
What worried and displeased Catherine more was that they did not know whether, after 14 days, they could be released from isolation and returned home without any symptoms of infection.
“网上的消息众说纷纭，我们希望有个确切的说法。
"There are so many different opinions on the Internet that we want to be exact.
”根据美国公共广播电台的报道，世界卫生组织突发卫生事件规划执行主任迈克尔・瑞恩（Michael Ryan）则在 2 月 7 日称，如果船上有发现新的感染，隔离期将被重设延长。
Michael Ryan, WHO's executive director of health emergency planning, said on February 7 that if new infections were found on board, the quarantine period would be extended.
另外，患者的密切接触者也会被重设观察期。
In addition, close contacts of patients are also re-established for observation periods.
为了平复乘客心情，船上已开始提供电话心理咨询，但大卫依旧告诉网友，他和妻子吃得越来越少。
Telephone counseling has been started to soothe passengers, but David told online he and his wife were eating less and less.
有日本乘客开始抱怨，目前船上大多提供美式餐食，虽然丰富，但他们想要清淡一些的日式餐食。
Some Japanese passengers began to complain that American food was mostly served on board, but they wanted lighter Japanese food.

2 月 8 日，一个叫“救他们离开钻石公主号”（Get Them off the Diamond Princess）的 Facebook 小组成立了。
On February 8, a Facebook group called "Get Them off the Diamond Princess" was set up.
小组共计 445 人，由澳大利亚乘客、记者和寻亲者组成。
The team consisted of 445 Australian passengers, journalists and marriage-seekers.
有人开始写信给澳大利亚驻东京领事馆和总理，领事馆响应最快。
Letters began to be written to the Australian Consulate and Prime Minister in Tokyo, which responded fastest.
2 月 8 日，澳大利亚乘客阿拉娜・唐纳森（Alana Donaldson）公布了领事馆的邮件回复——这艘邮轮归日本管辖，他们无权过问。
On February 8, Australian passenger Alana Donaldson released an e-mail response from the consulate that the ship was under Japanese jurisdiction and that they had no role to play.
2 月 9 日，一架澳航 747 飞机从武汉起飞，载着两百多名澳大利亚人回家。
On February 9, a Qantas 747 took off from Wuhan, carrying more than 200 Australians home.
这架澳洲撤侨班机让钻石公主号上的澳大利亚人满怀期待，希望政府帮助他们离开这艘“漂浮的监狱”。
The Australian evacuation flight filled Australians aboard the Princess Diamond with hopes that the government would help them get out of the "floating prison."
这两天，也有小组成员在社会公益请愿网站 change.org 发起了标题为“把他们带回家！”的请愿，截至 2 月 12 日下午，仅有 143 人签字。
On the same day, a petition entitled "Bring them home!" was also launched on the social welfare petition website change.org, with only 143 people signing up as of the afternoon of February 12.
小组发起人维拉・科斯洛娃-夫（Vera Koslova-Fu） 在帖子中表示她拒绝了许多媒体人的采访请求，更不打算像船上的网络红人大卫那样用视频记录自己的生活。
In her post, the group's founder, Vera Koslova-Fu, said she rejected requests for interviews from many media people, and didn't plan to record her life on video, as David, the online celebrity on board.
“公开分享会让我觉得心情抑郁。
"Sharing openly makes me feel depressed.
” 维拉也没有决定公开这个由她过去一位关系要好的同事和她发起的小组，因为初衷仅仅是让船上的澳大利亚公民平安回家。
Vera also did not decide to make public the group, which she used to have a close friend with, because the intention was simply to get the Australian citizens on board safely home.
不少乘客在积极与媒体联络。
Many passengers are actively liaising with the media.
美国乘客考特夫妇（Gay Courter 和 Philip Courter）使用 Google 云盘对外公开每日见闻，记录他们的状态和需求。
The American passengers Gay Court and Philip Court use Google Cloud Disks to make their daily news public, recording their status and needs.
他们分别是小说家与电影制作人，二人年届 80 岁，一双儿女在为联系媒体奔走。
They are novelists and filmmakers, aged 80, with a pair of sons and daughters campaigning for access to the media.

AT & # 45; Gay & amp; Phil Court & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45
舞厅灯光驳杂，人们脸色红润，舞步疯狂。
The ballroom lights were jumbled and people were ruddy and crazy.
考特夫妇的儿子气愤地发了 Twitter：“随机的舞伴！”现在看来，这的确有可能成为传染扩散的原因之一。
The couple's son angrily Twitter, "Random partners!" now appears to be one of the possible causes of the spread of the infection.
考特夫妇的阳台相对开阔，能看到横滨附近的海域和港口。
The couple's balcony was relatively open, with a view of the sea and harbor near Yokohama.
自隔离起，他们密切关注着运载车辆的动向。
Since their isolation, they have been closely watching the movement of vehicles.
有两个出口正在被张罗起来，蓝色的幕布支撑起两条长长的走廊。
Two entrances were being opened, and the blue curtain supported two long corridors.
即便如此，14 天的隔离还是得数着日子熬过去。
Even so, the 14-day isolation will have to be counted out.

在被醒目圈起的 19 号后边，则是 3 个问号——19 号，是钻石公主号目前计划解除隔离的日子，眼下，他们很难预料事情的走向。
Behind number 19, which had been conspicuously circled, were three question marks -- 19, the date on which the Diamond Princess was now scheduled to be de-quarantined.
盖曾写过一部关于邮轮谋杀案件的悬疑小说，提起这事，她笑道：“我们都觉得挺黑色幽默的。
Guy, who wrote a suspense novel about a cruise-murder case, laughed: "We all feel pretty darkly humorous."

2 月 7 日，他们在 Google 云盘里写道：“我们要感谢船员们不知疲倦地服务。
"We want to thank the crew for their tireless service," they wrote on Google's cloud cover on Feb. 7.
同时，更重要的是，我们认为他们也面临传染风险，因为他们住在更拥挤的宿舍里。
At the same time, and more importantly, we think they are also at risk of infection because they live in more crowded dormitories.
这些人签约进入服务行业，从未接受医务培训，不能像专业人士那样在具有潜在传染性的环境中工作。
These people are contracted into the service sector, have never received medical training and are not able to work in potentially contagious environments as professionals.

拥挤、不透气的空间的确是病毒传染的“温床”——船上共有 1000 多名船员生活在甲板下的内舱室，4 人共用一间卫生间，平时聚集在食堂用餐。
Crowded, airtight spaces do provide a "breeding ground" for the spread of the virus - more than 1,000 crew members live in the cabin below deck, four share a bathroom, and dine in the dining hall.
这些人大都来自印度、菲律宾、印度尼西亚、斯里兰卡、乌克兰等国家。
Most come from countries such as India, the Philippines, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Ukraine.
印度籍船员比拿・库玛・萨卡（Binay Kumar Sarkar）是钻石公主号的厨房炊事员。
The Indian crew member, Binay Kumar Sarkar, is the kitchen cook of the Princess Diamond.
他在 Facebook 视频里说：“医护人员只拿走了 500 多个样本，他们也只检测体温超过 37.5 度的人。
"They took just over 500 samples and they only tested people whose body temperature exceeded 37.5 degrees," he said in a Facebook video.
”他呼吁印度政府和联合国采取行动，无论是隔离、撤侨都可以，他们只想平安回家。
He called on the Indian government and the United Nations to take action, whether by separating or evacuating overseas Chinese, who want to return home safe and sound.
除了比拿，很少有船员愿意公开身份——他们担心丢掉工作。
With the exception of Bina, few crew members are willing to reveal their identities - for fear of losing their jobs.
2 名船员因为在社交媒体上表达情绪而受到警告。
Two crew members were warned for expressing their emotions on social media.
一位不愿具名的客舱侍者告诉“未来预想图”，他现在每天工作 12 个小时，中午有 3 小时午休，公司承诺，隔离期的工作日会支付 3 倍薪水。

“我们被禁止与乘客交流，只从新闻中获取信息，每个人都只能‘放心’。
"We are not allowed to communicate with passengers, we only get information from the news, and everyone can only 'feel at ease'.
”另一名匿名船员接受了乌克兰报纸《KP》的采访，“酒要钱，价格在 50 毫升 30 美元，非常昂贵，但食物是免费提供给所有人的。
Another anonymous sailor interviewed by the Ukrainian newspaper KP said: "Wine costs $50ml 30, which is very expensive, but food is free for everyone.
日本政府表示，他们会带来更多食物。
Japan's government says it will bring more food.
”这些员工没有防护服，平时仅佩戴口罩与一次性手套。
The employees did not have protective clothing and usually wore only face masks and disposable gloves.
厚生劳动省认为，因为船员不能与乘客接触，感染的可能性不大。
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare considers that the possibility of infection is low because the crew cannot come into contact with passengers.
日本厚生劳动省在一次记者会上澄清，他们的首要任务是解决药品。
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare clarified at a press conference that their first priority was to solve the drug problem.
药品以外的物资，他们会与地方政府一起提供给邮轮上的乘客。
Non-pharmaceutical supplies will be provided to passengers on the cruise ship together with the local government.

对此，日本厚生劳动省表示，这些举措遵循的是世界卫生组织（WHO）的指导方针。
In response, the ministry said the measures followed World Health Organization guidelines.
感染检疫官在 2 月 5 日至 2 月 7 日期间还在正常上班，9 日发烧，10 日送医确诊。

Passengers took part in the 16-day "Southeast Asian Sailing" cruise, which fetched between 250,000 yen (16,000 yuan) and 1.382 million yen (88,000 yuan) each.
亚洲公海上，还有许多邮轮，最近，它们也可能成为病毒高危易发区。
There are also many cruise ships on the high seas of Asia and, more recently, they could become high-risk areas for viruses.
据《日本经济新闻》报道，根据日本国土交通省的资料，外籍邮轮计划在 2 月停靠日本诸港 123 次，现已降至 75 次。
According to the Ministry of Land, Transport and Communications, the number of foreign cruise ships scheduled to call at Japan's ports in February dropped to 75, according to the Japan Economic News.
此外，许多途经中国的邮轮在多国港口被拒入港，不得不改变航行计划。
In addition, many cruise ships passing through China have been denied access to ports in several countries and have had to change their sailing plans.
国际游轮航线协会（Cruise Lines International Association）就此次疫情发出声明，在邮轮出发前的 14 日内，途经中国或表现出疑似症状的乘客或船员将被拒绝登船，成员公司会监控乘船者的身体状况。
The Cruise Lines International Association issued a statement about the outbreak, saying that passengers or crew members travelling through China or showing suspicious symptoms would be refused permission to board the ship within 14 days of departure, and member companies would monitor the condition of the ship's passengers.
该协会拥有超过 50 个邮轮公司会员，运营全球 95% 的邮轮航线。
It has more than 50 cruise company members and operates 95 per cent of the world's cruise routes.
公主邮轮于 2 月 9 日向“未来预想图”证实，日本厚生劳动省现已组成了由 16 名医生、12 名护士及医疗接待人员构成的专业医护团队，并安排向船上运送 600 余份药品，准备了 7000 个防护口罩。
Japan's Ministry of Health, Welfare and Labour has formed a professional medical team of 16 doctors, 12 nurses and medical personnel, and arranged for the delivery of more than 600 medicines and the preparation of 7,000 face masks, the newspaper said on February 9.
根据日本厚生劳动省公开的信息，他们从乘客处共计收到了 1700 多份药品申请，将根据紧急程度依次处理。
According to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, more than 1,700 applications were received from passengers, which will be dealt with according to the degree of urgency.
现在，检疫组优先检查高龄乘客与有发热等症状的人，标准更为细致，船上提供的口罩也升级为 N95 级别。
The Quarantine Section now gives priority to senior passengers and people with fever and other symptoms. The ship's mask has been upgraded to N95.
在 2 月 10 日的一场新闻发布会上，日本厚生劳动省大臣加藤胜信表示，在考虑引入民间检测公司与大学机构增加检测范围。
At a press conference on Feb. 10, Japan's Health, Labour and Welfare Minister Shinzo Kato said he was considering introducing private testing companies and universities.
日本内阁官房长官菅义伟则承认，“目前来看，检测所有人是有困难的。
Japan's chief cabinet secretary, Naoto Kan, acknowledged that "testing everyone is difficult at the moment.
”加藤胜信也表示，由于存在“实施机制原因”，加上必须考虑到万一其他地区发生疫情时的应对处置，此次没法对邮轮全员实施检查。
Mr Kato also said the full complement of cruise ships could not be inspected this time because of "implementation mechanism reasons" and the need to consider what to do in the event of an outbreak elsewhere.
但他也强调，为防止感染扩散，正在考虑为除一部分船员以外的所有乘船者做病毒检查。
He also stressed, however, that in order to prevent the spread of the infection, virus tests were being considered for all boaters except some of the crew.
2 月 7 日，日本国立感染研究所发布了一份《针对新型冠状病毒感染症的现状评价与日本国内监督、医疗机制整备报告》，其中提出了包括检测机制、医疗机制、确诊对策、疑似对策、出院标准等在内的各项基准。
On February 7, the National Infection Research Institute of Japan (NIPI) issued a report on the evaluation of the current situation of coronavirus infection and the preparation report of domestic surveillance and medical mechanism in Japan.
目前临床实践中发现的“假阴性”可能，也增加了检测过程的复杂性。
The "false-negative" possibility found in clinical practice also increases the complexity of the detection process.
△日本国立感染研究所提出的 SARS-CoV-2 感染症患者对应流程。

图片来源 |日本国立感染研究所据日本厚生劳动省推算，目前日本全国针对此次病毒的每日检测能力约为 1500 至 2000 件。
Japan's National Infection Institute has a daily detection capacity of about 1,500 to 2,000 for the virus nationwide, according to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.
日本电视台援引日本厚生劳动省一名职员的表述说，“由于还要处理归侨问题与其他一些原因，不能说所有的检测（试剂）都用在邮轮上。
"It cannot be said that all the tests [reagents] are used on cruise ships because of the need to deal with the issue of returned overseas Chinese and other reasons," Japanese television quoted an employee of the ministry as saying.
”也许会有新的解决方案。
There may be new solutions.
2 月 12 日，加藤胜信在日本众议院预算委员会集中审议时进一步提出，感染者在陆地运送过程中存在病毒传播风险，希望能“加快讨论配备检查与治疗功能的‘医院船’”。
On February 12, Kato further raised the issue of the risk of transmission of the virus during land transportation during intensive deliberations of the Budget Committee of the Japanese House of Representatives, hoping to "speed up the discussion on hospital ships" equipped with inspection and treatment functions.
目前，日本没有国家所有的“医院船”，但日本海上自卫队等机构拥有少量“医院船”，以及一批可以收治患者、设置手术台的船舶。
At present, Japan does not have a state-owned "hospital ship," but institutions such as the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force have a small number of "hospital ships," as well as a number of ships that can treat patients and set up operating tables.
截至 2 月 11 日，因为肺炎或其他疾病下船治疗的乘客与船上工作人员共计 16 人。

The Ministry of Health, Welfare and Labour announced on February 13 that a new round of tests will start with vulnerable groups such as senior passengers over the age of 80.
检测结果为阴性的乘客，若居住在没有窗户、窗户无法打开的房间里，或者拥有基础疾病，可依照本人意愿，于 2 月 14 日起陆续下船，前往政府准备的隔离机构度过隔离期。
Passengers with negative test results who live in rooms with no windows and whose windows cannot be opened, or who have basic illnesses, may disembark on 14 February, if they so wish, to spend the isolation period in isolation facilities prepared by the Government.
钻石公主号的隔离措施仍暂定于 2 月 19 日结束——尽管社交网络上，已多次出现针对邮轮上病毒进一步传播扩散的担忧。
