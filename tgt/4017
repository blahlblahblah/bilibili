主播，玩家，游戏企业，三种不同的角色，在疫情中做了同样的选择。
ANCHORThe host, the player, the game enterprise, three different roles, made the same choice in the epidemic.
当足不出户成为常态，游戏成了避风港时，这些或多或少遭遇过误解的人群，开始担起了更多的社会责任。
When homestay became the norm and games became safe havens, these more or less misunderstood people began to take on more social responsibility.
。
.
一。
One.
主播们大多没感到这期间的直播有什么不同，但作为身披影响力的普通人，他们做起了主播“该做的事”。
For the most part, the newscasters didn't feel that the live broadcast was any different, but as influential ordinary people, they did the "right thing" to do.
。
.
河北保定，安新县第一小学坐落在北大街一侧，位置四通八达。
Baoding, Hebei, Anxin County, the first primary school located on the side of North Street, located everywhere.
几十年前，嘟师傅就在这里念小学，现在学校后门建起了疫情检查站，他又以志愿者的身份回到这里，天天执勤，分文不取。
A few decades ago, Master Doodle was in elementary school, but now an epidemic checkpoint has been set up behind the school, and he returns here as a volunteer, working every day for nothing.
。
.
嘟师傅是斗鱼主机区的主播，平时直播时间大半在午夜。
Tudu master is the host of the main fighting area, usually live time in the middle of the night.
养成的特殊作息倒让执勤时间好受了些——三班轮流倒，登记人员，测体温，喷消毒液，嘟师傅每天就这么守在检查站里。
The special routine made it easier on duty -- three shifts, check-ins, temperature checks, disinfectant sprays, and that's how Tooters stay at checkpoints every day.
。
.
不过说是检查站，其实就是个小棚屋加上拦车的栏杆——老乡们用树枝，铁丝现做的。
But the checkpoint is actually a small shed plus a barge railing - made of twigs and wire.
而最开始的时候，连把凳子都没有，一站就是一天。
At the beginning, there was not even a stool, one stop was a day.
嘟师傅说，像脚上踩了一块冰。
Tudu said, like stepping on a piece of ice on the foot.
后来资源跟上了，环境好多了。
Then the resources kept up and the environment was much better.
嘟师傅也买了市场里的大棉鞋，穿两层袜子，就这么扛过去了。
Tudu master also bought the market in large cotton shoes, wearing two socks, just carry over.
。
.
要论主播当志愿者有什么不同，大体上是没什么的，但还是有些细枝末节的差异。
ANCHORWhat is the difference in volunteering, by and large, is nothing, but there are some minor differences.
周围的乡亲们都知道嘟师傅同时也在做主播，于是就不让他每天都去，留些时间多休息。
All the folks around him knew that Tudu was also a anchorman, so he was not allowed to go every day, so he had time to rest.
检查站再往里走几十米，就是嘟师傅从小长大的老宅子。
Checkpoint to walk a few dozen meters, is Tudu master grew up in the old house.
。
.
而当志愿者期间的动向，嘟师傅也都在鱼吧里更新，事无巨细，买的新鞋垫也会给水友们看看。
And when the movement of volunteers, toot teachers are also updated in the fish bar, no matter how small, buy new insoles will also give water friends to see.
底下的评论，也都是清一色的加油和鼓励，观众们也在彼此打气。
The following comments, are also the same color of refueling and encouragement, the audience is also encouraging each other.
。
.
人心暗中联结。
The secret heart connects.
评论多了，也有观众开始回复“我也在做志愿者”。
With more commentary, some viewers began to reply, "I'm volunteering, too."
我肃然起敬，嘟师傅说。
I respect you, Master Du said.
。
.
另一边，播《英雄联盟》的主播“溪子大人”也有做志愿者的想法，但因为买不到口罩只能作罢。
On the other hand, "Lord Creek," the host of Heroes, also has the idea of volunteering, but can't afford a mask.
溪子人在武汉，看到四地驰援，便少了几分慌乱，起了做事的想法，果断减免了自家访客的租金。
Xizi people in Wuhan, see the assistance of the four places, then a few minutes of panic, started to do things of the idea, decisively reduced their own visitors rent.
而具体金额数量，则“在承受范围之内”。
The specific amount of money, then "within the range of tolerance."
。
.
除了宅在家不给社会添麻烦，我能做的，只是力所能及不收租金这种小事，溪子说。
"All I can do is not charge rent as little as I can," he said.
。
.
类似的捐款行为，也在主播间席卷开来。
A similar act of donation swept through the main studios.
三万块钱，打给武汉市慈善总会，这是主播“午夜抹抹茶”的第一次大额捐款。
Thirty thousand yuan, call Wuhan City Charity Association, this is the first broadcast "midnight wipe tea" large donation.
但名义上，又不仅是他的。
But nominally, it's not just his.
因为在捐赠人姓名这里，午夜抹抹茶填进去的是“直播间全员”——观众也有份。
Because in the donor's name, the midnight eraser tea is filled in by the "direct-room crew" - and the audience has a share.
。
.
对于他们这些有更多时间在家直播的人来说，直播间的热度倒也略有上升。
For those of them who have more time to live at home, the popularity of the studio has risen slightly.
全民家里蹲，口罩和人际交流同时变为稀缺品。
The entire population squats, masks and interpersonal communication become scarce at the same time.
液晶屏幕成了倾诉情感的对象，而直播是其中最温情的方式。
The LCD screen is the object of emotional outpouring, and the live broadcast is the most affectionate of all.
。
.
“溪子大人”说，在封城期间他遇到过一些在同在武汉的观众。
"Lord Creek" said during the closure of the city he met some of the audience in Wuhan.
在这个危机而特殊的档口，隔着屏幕的主播和观众忽然成了命运共同体，让当主播的溪子突然有了种责任感：“我人在武汉，能用乐观的状态来直播，让武汉本地的水友宽慰，也让其他城市的水友知道真正的武汉人是怎么生活的，我觉得这是有积极作用的。
In this crisis and special file, across the screen anchor and audience suddenly become the fate of the community, let the director of the stream suddenly have a sense of responsibility: "I in Wuhan, can use optimistic state to broadcast, so that Wuhan local water friends, but also let other city water friends know how real Wuhan people live, I think it has a positive effect.
”。
"
“伙计”用武汉话说，读音就是“活接”。
"Dude" in Wuhan dialect said that the pronunciation is "alive."
溪子总是这么叫直播间的观众们，声音热情有力。
Creek always so called the audience in the studio, the voice of enthusiasm and strong.
溪子说，观众一听这一声声“活接”，就会说“哎哟你也是武汉人，你在武汉啊？你蛮精神咧，那我也不慌了。
Xi Zi said that the audience would say, "Oh, you are Wuhan, you are in Wuhan? You are very relaxed, then I do not panic.
”。
"
这是他作为一个主播，倍感亲切和成就感的时候。
It was a time when he felt a sense of closeness and accomplishment as a anchorman.
。
.
二。
II.
当原本用作休闲的游戏成了为数不多的去处，玩家们在这里尽可能的散发善意。
Players are trying to spread their goodwill here when games used for leisure have become the few places to go.
。
.
现实里，“武汉人”这个标签近乎成了道德困境的代名词，意味着出入受限，四处无门。
In reality, the label "Wuhan people" has become almost synonymous with moral dilemmas, meaning limited access and no access.
而游戏里的老豌豆倒不这么觉得，最近他在玩《绝地求生》时，喜欢一上来就报出自己武汉人的身份。
The old pea in the game did not think so. Recently, when he was playing Jedi Survival, he liked to come up and identify himself as Wuhan.
原因他没解释，但不难理解。
He did not explain the reason, but it was easy to understand.
。
.
在这一切以前，武汉一向安逸。
Before all this, Wuhan had been at ease.
老豌豆也于此定居有21年，无灾无难，直到现在被困在这九省通衢之城里。
The old pea, which has lived here for 21 years, has been stranded in the thoroughfare of the nine provinces.
没发生疫情的时候，他每天会玩一两小时《绝地求生》，现在也如此，雷打不动。
When there was no outbreak, he played Jedi for a couple of hours a day, and now he can't do it.
但体验却开始不同。
But the experience began to be different.
。
.
在某一局《绝地求生》里，老豌豆和素不相识的三个队友排到一起，告诉了队友他是武汉人后，得到了不少照顾。
In one round of Jedi Survival, the old pea got a lot of attention after he lined up with three unknown teammates and told his teammates that he was Wuhan.
游戏中局，开始跑毒，安全区远极了，凭老豌豆当时的血量和储备必然赶不过去。
In the game, began to run poison, the safe area is very far, with the old pea at that time the amount of blood and reserves will not pass.
在他放弃希望的时候，三位队友开始不顾危险，接力给他送药送子弹，就这样，老豌豆愣是被推出毒区，走到了安全圈里。
When he gave up hope, the three teammates began to ignore the danger, relay to send him medicine to send bullets, so old pea Leng was pushed out of the drug zone, into the safe circle.
。
.
在某种程度上来讲，这似乎是一个绝妙的隐喻。
To some extent, this seems to be an excellent metaphor.
但在游戏里，这也仅仅是如今的日常一景。
But in the game, it's just a daily occurrence today.
如今的老豌豆是个特殊的玩家，但不是个特殊的武汉玩家。
Today's old peas are a special player, but not a particular Wuhan player.
。
.
疫情爆发的档口，全民一片忧心，那时似乎是这期间的至暗时刻。
It seemed to be the darkest hour of the period when the whole population was worried about the outbreak.
就在这会儿，微博上一个博主把ID改成了“武汉加油”。
Just then, a blogger on Weibo changed his ID to "Wuhan refueling."
于是进了游戏，一切就不再平常，一位陌生人私信问他是不是武汉人，而询问的原因则是想“支付宝给你打1000”。
So into the game, everything is no longer ordinary, a stranger privately asked him if he was Wuhan, and the reason for the inquiry is "pay treasure to you call 1000."
“为什么陌生人的还以总能让人感动”，博主说。
"Why do strangers always move people," says the blogger.
而这件看似不经意的，游戏里的小事，也成了那一天的“清流”。
And this seems to inadvertently, the game in the small matter, has also become the day of the "clean flow."
。
.
而一些竞技类游戏的屏幕里，原先花里胡哨的ID，也变成了一个又一个的“武汉加油”。
And some competitive games on the screen, the ID of the original gaudy, also became one after another "Wuhan refueling."
有玩家说，碰到对面五黑，ID是清一色的“武汉加油”，很感动；有玩家说，现在开以局游戏，大家会一齐先发一句“武汉加油”；有玩家说，队友知道自己是武汉人后，就会给出小心又热情的鼓励。
Some players said that the encounter five black, ID is all colors of "Wuhan refueling", very moved; some players said that now the game, everyone will send a "Wuhan refueling," players said, teammates know that they are Wuhan, will give careful and warm encouragement.
。
.
当然，也有人觉得“不好意思”，因为总会碰到有对手让着他，表现得小心翼翼。
Of course, some people feel "embarrassed," because there will always be an opponent to let him, show caution.
在一向讲究公平竞技，实力至上的游戏里，输赢在忽然之间成了小事。
In always stress fair competition, the power supremacy game, lose and win suddenly became a small matter.
。
.
如今这些玩家们喊着的，是要赢下“这一局”。
Now these players are shouting that they want to win "this game."
。
.
而要问武汉人这期间游戏体验如何，大部分人感觉是“来之不易的放松”。
To ask Wuhan people how the game experience, most people feel "hard-won relaxation."
虚拟世界里的短暂逃避，让人更有精力去面对现实。
Virtual world in the short escape, so that people have more energy to face the reality.
。
.
一位身在疫区的玩家告诉我，他们小区在大年三十夜晚遭遇莫名停电。
A player in the epidemic area told me that their community in the New Year's Eve encountered inexplicable blackout.
一家人坐在黑暗中，情景凄凉。
The family sat in the dark, miserable.
他灵机一动掏出手机，拉父母玩起了斗地主。
He thought quickly took out his cell phone and pulled his parents into a fight with the landlord.
三人玩认真了，还计算起了输赢金额，休闲娱乐方式彼此平行的两代，第一次通过这种方式交汇到了一起。
The three played seriously, but also calculated the amount of the winning, leisure and entertainment in parallel with the two generations, the first time through this convergence.
。
.
三。
Three.
因足不出户的限制，从不停歇的社会开始徐徐停摆，一环扣一环的产业从起点陷落。
Due to the restriction not to leave the house, never stop the society began to slow down, a chain of industries from the beginning of the fall.
而被普遍认为能在这期间“吃香”的游戏行业，同样在尝试做些事情。
And the gaming industry, widely seen as "popular" during this period, is also trying to do something.
。
.
很多电竞选手并没有想到自己会有这样的时刻：他们站在镜头前，叮嘱大家“多洗手”“少出门”。
Many radio campaigners did not expect a moment when they would stand in front of the camera and tell everyone to "wash their hands more" and "go less."
。
.
上面提到的场景，来自于腾讯电竞联合旗下十一个赛事号召上百位电竞人发起的抗“疫”活动。
The above-mentioned scenes from Tencent's joint 11-event call for hundreds of electricity competitors to launch an "epidemic" campaign.
通过与多家行业媒体合作，采访不同行业的电竞从业者，让公众看到电竞人面对疫情最真实的一面，大概也是他们提出这个口号“共同战疫，我们在一起”的含义。
Through cooperation with various industry media, interviews with different industries of the Atletico operators, so that the public can see the most real face of the epidemic, probably they also put forward the slogan "common epidemic, we together.
。
.
这类举动的意图明显，效果也显著：经过多年的发展，电竞也已经成为了现代年轻人的一种生活方式。
The intention is obvious and the effect is remarkable: after many years of development, Atletico has also become a way of life for modern young people.
对于不少喜爱电竞的孩子们来说，他们视选手如偶像，这些电竞人的话语，也就格外听得下去。
For many kids who love Atletico, they see the contestant as an idol, so they can listen to the message.
。
.
在这次的抗疫行动中，我们看到了电竞已经成长为一个可以长期释放正面影响力的新型载体。
In this fight against the epidemic, we have seen the growth of Atletico as a new vehicle that can unleash positive influence in the long term.
这也意味这一个很明显的转变：原来看似远离“公众人物”形象的电竞人，也开始背上了和名气相符的责任感——同样的事情，也体现在了游戏产业里。
It also signifies a clear shift away from the image of "public figures" and towards a sense of responsibility consistent with celebrity - the same thing that is happening in the gaming industry.
。
.
翻看各大企业的捐款名单，你会发现游戏公司也成了中流砥柱之一（我们曾经做过一篇统计，可点我回顾）。
When you look at the corporate donation lists, you'll see that the gaming company is one of the pillars (we did a statistic, but I'll go back to it).
捐款的数量途径各不相同，但目的是一致的。
The ways in which contributions are channelled vary, but the purpose is the same.
而在游戏内举行的募捐行动，也成玩家们最热衷的活动之一。
And in the game held in the fund-raising action, players have become one of the most enthusiastic activities.
。
.
但抗疫的方式并不仅限于捐款，游戏既是互动艺术，又是消费产品，完全可以根据自身的特点，在抗疫中发挥更有机的作用。
But the way to fight the disease is not limited to donations, games are interactive art and consumer products, according to their own characteristics, can play a more organic role in the fight against the disease.
如近期国内便有61位游戏人联合起来，制作了一款名为《逆行者》的游戏，无盈利元素，只是这些游戏人想做一些自己力所能及的事。
Recently, for example, 61 players in China banded together to create a game called "The Walker," with no profit element, but the players wanted to do something within their power.
。
.
根据中国音数协游戏工委发布的《2019年中国游戏产业报告》，2019年中国游戏用户规模已经达到了6.4亿人。
According to the 2019 China Games Industry Report, published by the China National Association of Phonology and Games Working Committee, the number of game users in China has reached 640 million in 2019.
宅在家里的这段时光，游戏连接着来自五湖四海的玩家，企业们自然也深知这个现状。
Home in this period of time, the game connected players from all over the world, enterprises naturally also know this situation.
于是近些日子来，游戏内推送疫情相关资讯的事情多了起来。
So in recent days, in the game to push the spread of information about the epidemic has become more and more things.
让玩家们在游戏中娱乐之时，也能潜移默化地接受相关知识。
Let the player in the game entertainment, but also can subtly accept the relevant knowledge.
。
.
要说国内覆盖玩家最多的游戏企业是哪家，公认的答案是腾讯。
Tecent is the accepted answer to the question of which gaming company has the most players in the country.
在这段时间里，腾讯在自家几乎所有游戏里都推送了抗疫知识，引导玩家关注“腾讯医典”。
During this time, Tencent in almost all of their games have pushed the knowledge of anti-epidemic, leading players to pay attention to "Tencent medical code."
通常情况下，这种跨项目、跨部门的“异业合作”需要面对很多流程，但此次却并未遭阻力。
Often, such cross-project, cross-sectoral "inter-industry collaboration" faces many processes, but this time there is no resistance.
在负责推送功能的一位工作人员告诉我，大家响应都挺积极，甚至有很多自发的策划。
A staff member in charge of the push function told me that everyone was very positive, even a lot of spontaneous planning.
因为这些事，“和每个玩游戏的人都息息相关”。
Because of these things, "and everyone who plays the game is closely related."
。
.
截至2月17日，仅在腾讯游戏内的推送覆盖程度，已经达到了4.85亿人次。
As of February 17, Tencent alone had 485 million push hits.
不难猜测的是，部分不太关注疫情讯息的人，就这样通过游戏内的“医典”资讯，了解到了相关的注意事项。
It is not hard to guess that some people who do not pay much attention to the epidemic information, so through the game "medical code" information, learned about the relevant matters for attention.
有一些玩家反馈说，感受到了被关心，“我们觉得挺好”，这位工作人员告诉我。
Some players reported feeling cared about, "We feel good," the staff told me.
。
.
四。
Fourth.
审视“宅经济”。
Look at the "home economy."
。
.
主播，玩家，游戏企业，三种曾被误解的角色，在这场战役中开始被重新审视。
ANCHOR, Players, Game Enterprises, three once misunderstood characters, began to be re-examined in this battle.
。
.
2月19日，北京市委宣传部、市政府新闻办召开新闻发布会，宣布出台《关于应对新冠肺炎疫情影响促进文化企业健康发展的若干措施》，主旨在于大力发展“文化+互联网”。
On February 19, the publicity department of the Beijing Municipal Committee and the Municipal Government Information Office held a press conference to announce the launch of Measures to Address the Impact of the New Crown Pneumonia on the Healthy Development of Cultural Enterprises, with the main thrust of the campaign to develop "culture + Internet."
其中也针对电子竞技产业进行了扶持——地方政府开始对电子竞技产业的恢复上心。
Among them has also carried on the support to the electronic athletics industry - the local government starts on the electronic athletics industry restoration center.
。
.
政府的重视并非毫无缘由，在无法避免的经济下滑时期，“宅经济”扛下了部分冲击：直播网站流量大涨，应用商店游戏下载量激增，硬件设备畅销。
The government's focus is not without cause, and the "home economy" has borne some of the brunt of the inevitable economic downturn: surging traffic to live websites, a surge in downloads of app store games, and the best-selling of hardware.
游戏产业开始发光发热，背后是在其中得到身心放松的玩家们。
The gaming industry began to glow and glow, behind which the players relaxed physically and mentally.
这些曾经被认为象征负面的宅经济，以这个契机开始让人觉得不再消极。
Once seen as a symbol of a negative home economy, these opportunities are beginning to make people feel less negative.
或者说，电子游戏成了社会的精神后勤之一。
Or, video games have become one of society's spiritual logistics.
。
.
回看疫情之中，主播鼓励观众，玩家相互打气，企业担起责任。
Looking back on the epidemic, the anchorman encourages the audience, the player encourages each other, the enterprise assumes the responsibility.
这些讯号告诉我们，游戏产业原本需要长时间改变的社会印象，已经在如今这个时期开始猛然转变。
These signals tell us that the social image of the game industry, which needs to change over time, has begun to shift dramatically in this period.
随着5G技术的逐步铺开，如今“宅经济”的盛景在未来或多为常态。
With the gradual spread of 5G technology, the "home economy" of the boom in the future or more the norm.
。
.
无论是在未来的恢复疗伤途中，还是平稳回归的日子里，我们也希望游戏产业能像当下这般承担起更多，带来更多。
Whether on the road to recovery or a smooth return to life, we also hope that the game industry will be able to take on more and more of the same.
