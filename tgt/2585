国内疫情形势逐渐好转，在线医疗机构们到底能否经受住“后疫情时代”的挑战？文 | 徐徜徉 编辑| 朱弢      空格2020年初，一场新冠肺炎疫情将医疗行业推向了“风口浪尖”。
Can online health-care providers weather the post-epidemic challenge by gradually improving the epidemic at home? Early in 2020, a new outbreak of pneumonia pushed the health-care industry to the top of the list.
在湖北及全国各地的医院内，数万名医务人员奋战在“抗疫”一线救死扶伤，而在医院外，一场针对更多人的战“疫”也在悄无声息地打响。
In Hubei and hospitals around the country, tens of thousands of medical personnel in the "fight" front line to save lives, while outside the hospital, a more targeted "epidemic" is quietly starting.
疫情发生后，全国各地的线下诊疗渠道几乎被完全切断。
After the outbreak, access to offline care was almost completely cut across the country.
除新冠肺炎确诊患者外，广大“宅家人士”的诊疗需求如何得到满足？这时，在线医疗迎来了“天赐的舞台”。
In addition to the new crown pneumonia patients, the vast number of "homestead" diagnosis and treatment needs to be met? At this time, online medicine ushered in a "heaven-given stage."
多方在线医疗平台的数据显示，线上问诊量在近两个月内呈激增之势，诸多在线医疗概念股的市场表现也“节节高”。
Online consultations have surged in the past two months, and many online medical conceptuals are also "on the rise," according to data from the Multimedia Online Medical Platform.
有业内人士断言，2020年将成为互联网医疗的“爆发元年”。
Some industry insiders assert that 2020 will be the "first year of the outbreak" of Internet medicine.
但也有人认为，诊疗行为具有一定特殊性，“线上看病”永远替代不了“去医院看病”，在线医疗终究只是特殊时期的“昙花一现”……如今，国内疫情形势逐渐好转，在线医疗机构们到底能否经受住“后疫情时代”的挑战？流量暴涨背后疫情期间，各大在线医疗平台纷纷迎来流量“大丰收”。
However, some people believe that the diagnosis and treatment behavior has a certain particularity, "online medical treatment" can never replace "go to the hospital to see a doctor," after all, online medicine is only a special period of "flash in the pan.
“目前，网站每天的访问量都在百万级别，疫情专题页累计线上曝光量近1.16亿。
"There are millions of visits to the site every day, and the cumulative online exposure to the epidemic pages is nearly 116 million.
”39健康网总裁吕世峰说。
Lu Shifeng, president of HealthNet, said.
而阿里健康方面表示，截至2月10日晚20点，其问诊页面累计访问用户1116万，累计在线问诊量超过104万人次。
As of 20 p.m. on February 10, Ali's health authorities said, more than 1.04 million visits had been made online, with a cumulative total of 11.16 million visits.
春雨医生相关负责人谭万能介绍，截至2月25日下午17时，该平台发起的线上义诊已累计服务用户超150万人次，其中有60%为新增用户。
As of 17: 00 pm on February 25, more than 1.5 million users had been reached through online medical consultations, 60 percent of whom were new users, said Tan Pang, a doctor in charge of the program.
不少平台轻松实现了“业绩翻番”。
Many platforms have easily doubled their performance.
“微医新冠肺炎实时救助平台上线后，咨询量在前三天均翻倍增长。
"The number of consultations doubled in the first three days after the real-time MAP rescue platform went online.
”微医互联网总医院相关负责人张颂奇告诉记者：“截至2月25日9时，平台访问量超过1.16亿，已集结41196名医生在线接诊，累计提供医疗咨询服务143.71万人次。
"As of 0900 hours on February 25, more than 116 million visits had been made to the platform, 41,196 doctors had been assembled online and 1,437,100 medical consultations had been provided," Zhang Sonqi, director of the General Hospital of Micromedicine Internet, told reporters.
”此外，丁香园方面称，其在线问诊用户环比增幅为215.32%，问诊量环比增幅达134.91%。
The clove orchard also reported an increase of 215.32 per cent in online visits and 134.91 per cent in visits.
谭万能也表示，春雨医生义诊期间的日均问诊量较之前增加近100%。
Tan also said that the number of medical consultations per day during the doctor's medical treatment than before increased by nearly 100%.
从实际问诊情况看，将用户吸引到线上平台的最大“功臣”还是新冠肺炎。
From the actual situation of consultation, to attract users to the online platform is the largest "credit" or new crown pneumonia.
据阿里健康数据，用户咨询量最多的科室是“呼吸科”，咨询问题主要集中于新冠肺炎及相关疾病的防治。
According to Ali's health data, the department with the largest number of user consultations is the "respiratory department," the main consultation focus on the prevention and treatment of new crown pneumonia and related diseases.
丁香园方面也表示，在线咨询的问题主要集中在“判断感冒症状是否属于新冠肺炎、口罩的正确佩戴方法，及低热处理方式”等，其中前两者占比高达51.3%。
The clove garden also said online consultations focused on "determining whether cold symptoms are New Crown Pneumonia, proper wearing of masks and low heat treatments," with the first two accounting for 51.3 per cent.
对于另一些身患其他疾病又无法线下就医的患者，线上医疗平台也解其“燃眉之急”。
For other patients suffering from other diseases and unable to access online medical treatment, online medical platform also solve their "urgent needs."
吕世峰告诉记者：“中国目前有近3亿人患有慢性疾病，如心脑血管疾病、肝病、免疫系统疾病等，这部分病患在疫情期间多半不能到医院去，所以慢性病在39健康网上的问诊量也比较大。
"Nearly 300 million people in China suffer from chronic diseases, such as cardio-cerebrovascular diseases, liver diseases, immune system diseases and so on," Lu told reporters.
”易观研究院数据显示，2020年春节期间，在线问诊领域独立APP日活最高峰达到了671.2万人，最大涨幅接近160万人，涨幅31.28%。
According to the institute, during the 2020 Spring Festival period, the number of independent APPs in the field of online consultation peaked at 6.712 million, with the biggest increase close to 1.6 million, or 31.28 percent.
易观分析师陈乔姗认为，疫情促使更多用户自愿或半自愿地开始了解和接触在线医疗。
Eyesight analyst Chen Qiaoshan believes that the epidemic has prompted more users to voluntarily or involuntarily begin to understand and access online health care.
“义诊活动不仅大幅提高了互联网医疗用户的整体规模和渗透率，同时也成功‘出圈’，触达到健康人群，为互联网医疗领域收获了新的流量。
"Not only has the free clinic greatly increased the overall size and penetration of Internet medical users, but it has also succeeded in reaching healthy people and reaping new traffic in the field of Internet medicine.
”资料来源：易观研究院但她同时表示，企业在收获流量的同时，更应关注如何留住用户尤其是年轻用户的问题。
Source: IEA but she also says companies should focus more on how to retain users, especially young users, while harvesting traffic.
“针对年轻用户的服务质量将成为在线医疗企业面临的新考验，在这方面表现优异的企业才会成为疫情爆发期间真正的赢家。
"The quality of services for young users will be a new test for online health companies, and it is in this respect that companies that excel will be the real winners during the outbreak."
”“医疗行业具有一定特殊属性，要求覆盖诊前导流、诊中问诊、诊后开方、在线支付、药品配送的整体闭环。
"The medical profession has special attributes that require coverage of the overall closed loop of pre-clinical flow, consultation, prescription, online payment and drug distribution.
其中每一个环节都将影响用户的留存度和黏性。
Each of these links will affect the retention and viscosity of the user.
”张颂奇表示。
Mr Cheung said.
在吕世峰看来，疫情最大的作用是使“医疗互联网化的应用得到了推广”，但在线医疗的核心还是“医疗”，“未来，机构们更应该做的还是优化产品、提升技术能力、加速精准化流量入口建设、做好服务运营体系升级。
According to Lu, the biggest effect of the epidemic has been to "promote the use of medical internet," but the core of online medicine is "health care." "In the future, organizations should do more to optimize their products, upgrade their technical capabilities, speed up the construction of accurate traffic entrances, and upgrade their service delivery systems."
”丁香园创始人、董事长李天天承认，疫情确实“帮助企业完成了一次很好的用户教育”，但他不认为这预示着“行业的拐点已经到来”，而是建议各界对行业“保持合理的预期”。
Li, founder and chairman of the clove orchard, admitted every day that the outbreak did "help companies do a good job of user education," but he did not see it as a "turning point for the industry" and suggested "reasonable expectations" for the industry.
“在这一阶段，更为关键的是看谁能打磨好产品、深度理解到用户的需求。
"At this stage, it is even more critical to see who can polish the product and understand the user's needs in depth."
”李天天说。
"said Li every day.
弗若斯特沙利文报告预测，中国在线医疗2020年的市场规模将达到千亿元，2026年市场规模将达到2000亿元，2020-2026年的复合年增长率约为14.23%。
The Frost Sullivan report predicts that China's online-health market will reach 100 billion yuan by 2020, 200 billion yuan by 2026 and 14.23 percent by 2020-2026.
数据来源：弗若斯特沙利文 图片来源：中国产业信息网医生争夺战事实上，在线医疗机构的“流量收割”之路并非像看上去那么平坦。

随着在线问诊量的急剧攀升，医疗资源的供不应求成为最大“拦路虎”，而其中最为核心而珍贵的资源，就是医生。
With the rapid increase of online consultation, the shortage of medical resources has become the biggest obstacle, and the most important and precious resource is doctors.
张颂奇透露，为了满足激增的服务需求，微医新冠肺炎实时救助平台的在线医生数量在10天内实现了十倍增长：“上线义诊平台的第一天（1月23日），我们召集了第一批1500名医生，但后来发现远远不够，到了2月4日，这个数字变成了1.8万名。
To meet surging service demand, the number of online doctors on the MAP platform increased tenfold in 10 days: "On the first day of the online free clinic platform (January 23), we assembled the first 1,500 doctors, but it turned out to be insufficient. By February 4, the number had risen to 18,000.
”问诊订单的激增让微医团队始料未及——“我们通过后台数据发现：用户的候诊时间被明显拉长，服务器负荷吃紧，首批在线接诊的呼吸、感染和内科医生开始应接不暇。
The surge in requests was unexpected to the micromedical team - "We found through background data that waiting times for clients were significantly longer, server loads were tight, and the first online consultations began to overwhelm breathing, infections, and physicians."
看着后台排队的患者越来越多，运营团队一度非常焦虑。
Looking at the background queuing more and more patients, the operation team was very anxious at one time.
”为了缓解候诊用户等待的焦虑，微医鼓励已在线的1500位医生介绍身边的医生入驻，通过一层层的裂变来扩大“搜寻”范围，找到更多的医生。
To allay the anxiety of waiting lists, microdoctors are encouraging 1,500 doctors already online to introduce their doctors around them, widening the "search" through layers of fission to find more doctors.
随后，更大的转机也出现——天津、黑龙江、河北等地卫健委及武汉市卫健委先后发文鼓励医生上线服务患者，并在当地官方网站上线“微医新冠肺炎实时救助平台”，这帮助微医在短时间内招募到大量医生。
Then came a bigger turnaround - Tianjin, Heilongjiang, Hebei and so on, and Wuhan's health committee sent letters encouraging doctors to serve patients online, and on the local official website, the "Real-time Rescue Platform for Micro-crown Pneumonia," which helped microdoctors recruit large numbers of doctors in a short period of time.
“这之后，医生的增长速度就基本保持在每天2000人左右，最高的一天入驻了7000多位医生。
"Since then, the growth rate of doctors has remained at around 2,000 per day, with more than 7,000 doctors admitted on the highest day.
”张颂奇说。
'he said.
李天天也表示，疫情不仅“教育”了用户端，更“教育”了供给端。
Li also said every day that the epidemic not only "educates" customers, but also "educates" the supply side.
“在丁香园的论坛里，我们看到很多原来对互联网在线服务并不了解的医生，也开始写下了这样的留言：‘这是我第一次在线问诊，应该要注意些什么？’，更多医生已开始认识到互联网医疗的价值。
"In the clove garden forum, we saw many doctors who had no knowledge of Internet online services and started to write messages such as' This is my first online consultation, what should I notice? 'More doctors have come to realize the value of Internet medicine.
”不过，和医生群体的基数相比，真正参与在线诊疗的医生数量占比依然很小。
However, the number of doctors actually involved in online consultations remains small compared with the base figure for doctors.
李天天透露，丁香园现有医生用户存量为200多万，但实际参与在线问诊的医生数量仅有1.5万多人，“比例不到1%”。
Li said every day that there were more than 2 million doctors in the clove garden, but the number of doctors who actually attended online consultations was just over 15,000, "less than 1 percent.
如何进一步提升对医疗尤其是医生资源的挖掘能力？阿里健康方面认为，应“加快、加强医生上线前的资质审核速度和培训效率”。
How to further improve the ability of medical treatment, especially the resources of doctors? Ali health aspects, should "speed up, strengthen the qualifications of doctors before the online review and training efficiency."
春雨医生相关负责人谭万能则分析称：“缓解医疗资源的供需矛盾，一方面要增加供给，另一方面要提升效率。
"To ease the contradiction between supply and demand of medical resources, on the one hand, to increase supply, on the other hand, to improve efficiency," said Tan Pang-lan, director of Dr. Chunyu.
人工智能作为一种创新技术，将是改善医疗领域供给不足的重要方向。
Artificial intelligence, as an innovative technology, will be an important direction to improve the shortage of medical supplies.
”在易观分析师陈乔姗看来，通过这次疫情，在线医疗企业已向政府及社会证明了自己对于实体医疗体系的补充意义。
Chen Qiaoshan, an analyst with the company, said the epidemic had demonstrated to the government and society their added value to the physical health-care system.
“但与线下医疗机构相同的是，医生资源的数量和储备决定了平台的接诊能力，而如何转化、培养并使这波新流量成为自身的可付费用户，将成为各家深耕的重点。
"But like off-line medical institutions, the number and availability of doctors' resources determine the platform's ability to receive care, and how to transform, nurture and make this new flow their own paying user will be the focus of every family's deep cultivation."
”“《2019中国互联网医院发展研究报告》显示，超八成医院计划在2年内完成互联网医院建设。
"The 2019 China Internet Hospital Development Study shows that more than 80 per cent of hospitals plan to complete construction of Internet hospitals within two years.
”陈乔姗进一步解释：“与医院的协同合作能力，将成为在线医疗企业的重要机遇，新的或更深层次的协同和共生模式将被创造出来，抓得住这个机遇的企业将有机会成为巨头。
"The ability to work collaboratively with hospitals will be an important opportunity for online healthcare companies, new or deeper patterns of synergy and symbiosis will be created, and companies that can seize this opportunity will have a chance to become giants."
”期待更多政策红利在线医疗行业自诞生以来的每一步发展，都与国家政策息息相关。
Every step in the development of the online health-care industry since it was born is tied to national policy.
据东兴证券不完全统计，从2016年至2019年，国务院和卫生部门发布了十几份关于“加强在线医疗建设”的政策文件。
According to incomplete statistics of Dongxing Securities, from 2016 to 2019, the State Council and the Ministry of Public Health issued more than a dozen policy documents on "Strengthening the construction of online medical care."
政策主要分为两类：一类着重于“规划”：针对现阶段医疗行业出现的医疗资源不均衡、医疗流程效率不高等问题，提出用在线医疗来提高医疗资源配置效率；另一类着重于“试行”：从放权、规范和监督三个层面支持在线医疗建设。
There are two main types of policies: one focuses on "planning": online medicine is proposed to improve the efficiency of medical resource allocation; the other focuses on "trial": supporting online health care from three levels: decentralization, regulation and supervision.
资料来源：东兴证券这次新冠肺炎疫情中，在线医疗也得到鼓励。

2月3日，国家卫健委办公厅下发《关于加强信息化支撑新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情防控工作的通知》，要求充分发挥互联网医院、互联网诊疗的独特优势，鼓励在线开展部分常见病、慢性病复诊及药品配送服务，降低其他患者线下就诊交叉感染风险。
On February 3, the office of the National Fitness and Health Commission issued the Notice on Strengthening the Prevention and Control of Pneumonia Supported by New Coronavirus Infections through Informatization, which calls for giving full play to the unique advantages of Internet hospitals and Internet therapy, encouraging online services for common diseases, chronic diseases and drug distribution, and reducing the risk of cross-infection for other patients.
图片来源：国家卫健委官网2月7日，国家卫健委办公厅下发《关于在疫情防控中做好互联网诊疗咨询服务工作的通知》，再次提出充分利用“互联网+医疗”的优势作用，并从科学组织、有效开展、实施监管等多个方面提出具体指导。
Photo: National Health Officers Network February 7, the National Health Commission issued the "Notice on Internet consultation services in the prevention and control of epidemic diseases," again put forward the advantages of "Internet + medical care," and from scientific organization, effective development, implementation of supervision and other aspects of specific guidance.
图片来源：国家卫健委官网随后，武汉市医疗保障局在2月26日为微医互联网总医院开通医保支付，该互联网医院也成为武汉首家纳入医保支付的平台型互联网医院。
http: / / www.51education.net www.youtheme.cn www.youtheme.cn www.youtheme.cn www.youtheme.cn http: / / www.51education.net.cn Subsequently, Wuhan Medical Security Bureau opened a medical insurance payment for the Micromedical Internet General Hospital on February 26.
医保接入后，药品费用将得到医保报销，患者只需支付个人自付部分。
After access to health care, Medicare reimburses the cost of the drug and the patient pays only for his or her out-of-pocket portion.
而除武汉之外，还有多个省市在疫情期间临时将互联网诊疗纳入医保支付范围，例如浙江、天津、江苏、上海等地。
Besides Wuhan, many provinces and cities, such as Zhejiang, Tianjin, Jiangsu and Shanghai, have temporarily included Internet clinics in their medical coverage during the epidemic.
广发证券分析师杨琳琳认为，互联网医疗政策已从试水探索期过渡到规范发展期。
Guangfa Securities analyst Yang Linlin believes that the Internet medical policy has been from the exploratory phase of water testing to the standard development period.
目前，互联网医疗服务已开始被纳入医疗保障支付体系，在线开展部分常见病、慢性病复诊及药品配送服务也受到了国家鼓励，这预示着未来“政策有望持续落地”。
At present, Internet medical services have begun to be included in the medical insurance payment system, and the online development of some common diseases, chronic diseases and drug distribution services has been encouraged by the state, heralding a "sustained landing of policies" in the future.
东兴证券分析师王健辉则预测，新冠肺炎疫情或将推动在线医疗领域相关政策的出台和落地。
Wang Jianhui, an analyst at Dongxing Securities, predicts that the outbreak of Newcap Pneumonia may prompt the introduction and landing of policies in the field of online medicine.
“我国在线医疗跨越了以在线挂号为代表的1.0时代，目前正处于以在线医院为代表的2.0时代，未来将向以三医联动为代表的3.0时代迈进。
"Our online medical service has passed the 1.0 era represented by online registration and is now in the 2.0 era represented by online hospitals, which will move forward to the age of 3.0 represented by the association of three medicine practitioners.
3.0时代将搭建起医疗、医药、医保三医联动体系，构建出以个人健康为中心的医疗服务体系。
3.0 Era will set up the system of medical treatment, medicine and medical insurance, and construct the medical service system with individual health as the center.
”目前，业界对于未来政策改革的期待主要集中于两方面：一是放开部分病种首诊限制，二是进一步完善互联网诊疗医保支付政策，解决在线医保支付、购药等问题。
The industry's expectations for future policy reforms are now focused on two areas: first, to liberalize the first consultation limits for some diseases, and second, to further improve the payment policy for medical consultation and treatment on the Internet, and to address online health-care payments and drug purchases.
李天天建议，在通过互联网和新技术推进医疗行业变革的过程中，应当在确保安全和质量的前提下，对“互联网首诊”开展积极探索。
Li daily suggested that in the process of promoting medical industry reform through the Internet and new technologies, "Internet first consultation" should be actively explored on the premise of ensuring safety and quality.
阿里健康方面也透露，希望政策端能进一步充分发挥互联网医疗平台的协调作用，允许互联网医疗首诊。
Ali health also revealed that the hope that the policy can further play the role of Internet health platform coordination, allowing Internet medical first consultation.
“互联网医疗平台和互联网医院如果可以提供首诊患者诊疗服务，既可以避免在物理空间造成交叉感染风险，也能分流实体医院的压力。
"Internet-based medical platforms and Internet hospitals can both avoid the risk of cross-infection in physical space and divert pressure from physical hospitals if they can provide first-time patient care."
”微医方面则表示，期待进一步完善医保支付政策，建立费用分担机制，健全互联网诊疗收费政策，让百姓足不出户就可以医保支付完成在线复诊和购药，享受一站式的医疗健康服务体验。
"Micromedicine said it looked forward to further improving health-care payment policies, establishing a fee-splitting mechanism and improving Internet-based consultation and treatment fees so that people can pay for online revisits and drug purchases without leaving their homes and enjoy a one-stop health-care experience.
李天天分析，虽然有些地方政府已经出台了相关政策，将互联网诊疗纳入到医保中来，但异地就医的问题还是没有得到解决。
Li daily analysis, although some local governments have introduced policies to include Internet treatment in health care, but the problem of access to health care has not been resolved.
“目前，上海的患者只能在上海当地医院的线上互联网平台咨询问题，才能予以报销，而互联网医院可能设在任何地方。
"Currently, patients in Shanghai can only be reimbursed for consulting an online Internet platform at a local hospital in Shanghai, which may be located anywhere.
异地的问题解决不了，就大大限制了互联网的优势。
The inability to solve problems in different places greatly limits the advantages of the Internet.
”“可以考虑将互联网作为分级诊疗服务的入口，实现医疗服务需求的快速筛选和科学分发。
"Consideration could be given to using the Internet as an entry point for graded clinical services to enable rapid screening and scientific distribution of medical needs.
同时，在家庭医生和健康管理等需要连续动态服务的领域，也希望能更多地考虑互联网医疗公司这类社会机构。
At the same time, it is hoped that more consideration will be given to social institutions such as Internet medical companies in areas such as family doctors and health management, which require continuous and dynamic services.
