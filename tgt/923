办理值机的柜台，工作人员看到湖北签发的护照，下意识地向后躲了躲，接着拿起电话，用英文说着什么。
Check-in counter, the staff saw Hubei issued a passport, subconsciously hiding back, then picked up the phone, said something in English.
口述 | 王　丰整理 | 吴　雪武汉市长周先旺1月26日晚在新闻发布会上说有500多万武汉人离开武汉，而我们一家三口就是这500万中的一员——“武汉流浪者”。
At a news conference last night, Mr. Wang said that more than five million Wuhan people left Wuhan, and that our three members were among those five million.
我叫王丰，是武汉一家证券公司的员工，几天前，听闻“李文亮去世的消息，十分心痛。
My name is Wang Feng, an employee of a securities company in Wuhan. A few days ago, I heard the news of Li Wenliang's death.
12月31日，我就在朋友圈看到过李医生说有传染病的聊天截图，当时求证武汉中心医院的同学，得到的回答是：“得这个病的人不少，情况确实严重”。
On December 31, I saw Dr. Li talking about infectious diseases in a circle of friends. At that time, I checked with my classmates at Wuhan Central Hospital and got the answer: "There are quite a few people with this disease, and the situation is really serious."
我工作的地点距离华南海鲜市场仅两公里，所以不敢掉以轻心，1月初我们一家人就警觉地戴上了口罩。
I worked just two kilometers from the South China seafood market, so I didn't take it lightly. My family put on a mask alert in early January.
在澳大利亚和女儿的合影每年春节出游是我家的传统，今年和爱人商量后选择去澳大利亚。
The annual Spring Festival outing is a tradition in my family. This year, I choose to go to Australia after discussing with my wife.
很多人问我，是不是知道封城要逃离武汉，听了这话非常戳心。
Many people asked me if I knew the city was fleeing Wuhan, listening to this very poignant.
其实不是，折扣机票在半年前就订好了，当时哪里预料到疫情会像今天这般严重。
Not really. Discount tickets were booked six months ago, when the epidemic was expected to be as severe as it is today.
当时唯一的担心是3岁女儿刚在12月份因肺炎住过院，武汉这两天又在下雪，又是流感爆发期，万一在机场测出体温异常，飞不了了怎么办。
The only concern was that the three-year-old had just been hospitalized with pneumonia in December, that it was snowing in Wuhan over the past two days and that there was an outbreak of influenza. What if an abnormal temperature was detected at the airport and she could not fly?
一家三口的航班行程武汉没有直飞墨尔本的航班，机票订在上海浦东起飞。
Wuhan has no direct flights to Melbourne. Tickets are scheduled to take off in Pudong, Shanghai.
1月18号晚上，我们一家三口拖着两个大行李箱，乘坐高铁前往虹桥火车站，然后乘坐出租到达浦东机场，在高铁上并没有多少人戴口罩，出租车师傅也没戴。
On the evening of January 18, three of us took a high-speed train to Hongqiao Railway Station with two large suitcases. Then we took a taxi to Pudong Airport.
当时钟南山院士还未说有“人传人”的症状，机场安检口检查也一切如常。
At that time, academician Zhong Nan Shan has not said that there are "human-to-human" symptoms, airport security checkpoints also everything as usual.
很顺利，第二天中午我们就到了墨尔本。
It went well. We arrived in Melbourne at noon the next day.
在墨尔本的五天，女儿玩得很开心。
My daughter had a good time during her five days in Melbourne.
女儿在悉尼科技大学女儿在澳大利亚空旷的草地上奔跑但也是在这5天，武汉发生了天翻地覆的变化。
The daughter of Sydney University of Science and Technology in Australia's open grass run but also in the past five days, Wuhan has undergone tremendous changes.
1月20日，钟南山证实了人传人传播，并公布有医护人员感染；1月23日，武汉封城。
On January 20, Zhong Nan Shan confirmed human-to-human transmission, and announced the infection of medical personnel; January 23, Wuhan closed.
1月24日，湖北省启动突发公共卫生事件一级应急响应，远在武汉的父母打来电话说，已经去超市抢购了菜品，做好了长时间足不出户的准备，往日热闹的江汉街、户部巷等繁华街道，也变得空无一人了。
On January 24, Hubei Province launched a public health emergency first-class response, parents as far away as Wuhan called to say that they had rushed to the supermarket to buy food, ready to stay home for a long time, and the bustling streets of Jianghan Street and Hubei Lane had become empty.
看着新闻上病例的增多，作为“敏感”的武汉人，我开始担心一系列的问题。
Looking at the increase in cases on the news, as a "sensitive" Wuhan people, I began to worry about a series of problems.
比如，武汉到上海的高铁，会不会有感染的人群，虽然我们没敢摘下口罩；比如，澳大利亚的酒店会不会不接待武汉人、回国的航班会不会受阻等等。
For example, Wuhan to Shanghai high-speed rail, there will be infected people, although we do not dare to take off masks; for example, the hotel in Australia will not receive Wuhan, return flights will be blocked, and so on.
事实上，当时澳大利亚还没有那么严格，也没有特别对待湖北游客。
In fact, Australia was not as strict at the time, nor did it treat Hubei tourists specifically.
1月25日，因为山火始终未扑灭，本来打算自驾到悉尼的我们，选择买机票前往。
On 25 January, as the mountain fire had never been extinguished, we had intended to drive to Sydney from where we had chosen to buy air tickets.
在准备回国的前一天，1月29日，澳大利亚已有6人确诊感染新冠肺炎，当天，澳大利亚总理莫里森宣布从湖北武汉撤侨；第二天，从悉尼飞武汉的直飞全部取消。
The day before returning home, on January 29, six people in Australia were confirmed to have contracted the new crown pneumonia, and Australian Prime Minister Morrison announced the evacuation of overseas Chinese from Hubei Province.
接下来的回国历程，让我感受到对湖北游客的“特别对待”。
The next journey home, let me feel the Hubei tourists "special treatment."
爱人和女儿在机场机票取消之后，我一心想去的是海南，那里气候适宜，小朋友待着也舒服。
Love and daughter in the airport after the cancellation of the ticket, I want to go to Hainan, where the climate is appropriate, the children stay comfortable.
但没有直飞海南的机票，所以我先订到了香港，从香港中转再到海南。
But there is no direct flight to Hainan, so I booked it first to Hong Kong, then from Hong Kong to Hainan.
但那时香港已经限制湖北人入境，加上我们的行李多，需要重新办理入境，所以A方案否决。
But then Hong Kong already restricted the entry of Hubei people, and our baggage, need to re-enter the country, so A plan was rejected.
B方案就是直飞昆明，正好有一个合适的航班。
Option B is to fly directly to Kunming, just in time for a suitable flight.
C方案是暂时留澳，等情况好转，再回国。
Option C is temporary stay in Australia, wait for the situation to improve, then return home.
考虑到小朋友还小，一旦在澳有个头疼发热，不仅语言不通，各方面可能都不如国内方便。
Considering that children are still small, once in Australia has a headache feverish, not only language, all aspects may not be as convenient as home.
当然，也担心万一澳酒店不给我们办入住，很可能有露宿街头的风险，商量后，我们一致选择了B方案——直飞昆明。
Of course, also worried that in the event that we do not check-in hotel in Australia, there may be a risk of sleeping on the street, after discussion, we unanimously chose option B - direct flight to Kunming.
2月2日，在悉尼国际机场，我们踏上了去往昆明的航班，澳机场与一周前入境时大不相同。
On February 2, at Sydney International Airport, we embarked on a flight to Kunming, a far cry from when we entered the country a week ago.
安检口、售票口的工作人员大部分都戴了口罩，游客中戴的则不多，只有一些亚裔面孔的中国人、韩国人、日本人全部戴着。
Most of the staff at security checkpoints and ticket outlets wear masks, while few tourists wear them, except some Asian-looking Chinese, Koreans and Japanese.
办理值机的柜台，工作人员看到湖北签发的护照，下意识地向后躲了躲，接着拿起电话，用英文说着什么。
Check-in counter, the staff saw Hubei issued a passport, subconsciously hiding back, then picked up the phone, said something in English.
东方航空值机柜台很快，机场两个负责人找到我们，用不太熟练的中文说：“不好意思，我们能不能做一个单独值机。
Shortly after the Eastern check-in counter, the two airport officials approached us and said in less proficient Chinese, "Excuse me, can we do a stand-alone flight
”我们表示配合，他们先手温枪帮我们测了体温，接着又询问了旅游的路线和基本情况，并签了健康承诺书，最后，我们到了另一个空旷的柜台，这才完成了值机。
We said yes, they took our temperature with their muskets first, then asked about the itinerary and the basics of the trip, signed the letter of commitment to health, and finally got to another empty counter before we finished the flight.
因为这趟航班上大多数是云南人，我们三人登机后，自觉坐到了最后一排，全程佩戴口罩，没有到处走动。
Since most of the passengers on this flight were from Yunnan, the three of us sat down in the last row, wearing masks and not walking around.
飞机上的东航乘务员有过专业培训，没有特别看待我们。
The East Airways flight attendants had specialized training and didn't look at us particularly.
实际上，我和爱人并不清楚昆明对待湖北游客的安置情况，刚开始还有点担心。
In fact, my wife and I did not know Kunming treatment of Hubei tourists resettlement, at first a bit worried.
2月3日早上5：30落地昆明后，东航乘务组先让云南的乘客下飞机，接着海关带着疾控中心的人上来测体温，再接着，我们被带到了“症状游客留观室”，了解身体状况，记录行程轨迹，总共花费了两个小时。
After landing in Kunming at 5: 30 a.m. on February 3, the crew of China Eastern Airlines let Yunnan passengers off the plane, then the customs and CDC personnel came up to take a temperature check, and then we were taken to the "symptomatic visitors' observation room," where we learned about our health and recorded our itinerary.
幸好，飞机上没有发烧人员，要不然可能耗时会更长。
Fortunately, there were no feverish people on board, otherwise it would have taken longer.
中国边检出境口昆明机场症状旅客留观室当时接待我们的是一个湖北老乡，他说，你们不用担心，昆明这边针对“无症状的湖北游客”有一些安置的酒店，吃住免费，只要待上14天，隔离确认无症状后，便可以买昆明飞往其他城市的机票。
You don't have to worry, Kunming had some sort of hotel for the 'asymptomatic Hubei tourists' side, 'he said.' You can buy tickets for Kunming to other cities after only 14 days and isolation and asymptomatic identification.
我长舒了一口气，这下再也不用担心在外“流浪”了。
I breathed a long sigh of relief that I no longer had to worry about vagrancy outside.
机场派来了专车，送我们到达指定酒店锦江之星，酒店前台虽然“全副武装”，但很热情地接待了我们。
The airport sent a special bus to take us to the designated hotel, Jinjiang Star, the front desk although "fully armed," but very warm reception us.
锦江之星是一家快捷酒店，我们一家三口被安排在了一个标间。
Jinjiang Star is a fast-track hotel, our family of three people were arranged in a standard room.
每天一日三餐，两荤一素外加白米饭，伙食很不错，昆明盛产水果，一天下来苹果、香蕉、橘子不断，早餐还有酸奶。
Three meals a day, two meat and white rice, food is good, Kunming is rich in fruit, apple, banana, orange, breakfast and yogurt.
如果想吃点其他的，酒店还可以帮忙在附近定点餐馆点外卖，只需付一个炒菜的钱就行。
If you're looking for something else, the hotel can also order takeout at a nearby specialty restaurant for just one stir-fry charge.
女儿在酒店吃饭酒店提供的酸奶和水果指定酒店服务不止三餐，为了安置游客的身体健康，避免去往医院的交叉感染，社区医生一天上门监测两次体温、警察也在附近定点执勤。
More than three meals are served in the sour cream and fruit restaurants designated by the daughters at the hotel. To keep tourists healthy and avoid cross-infection to the hospital, community doctors monitor body temperature twice a day and police are stationed nearby.
如果还有任何、比如说药品或者其他小需求的话，可以告知酒店的人员，然后由他们帮忙代购。
If you have any small needs, such as medications or other small items, talk to the hotel staff, who can then help you with the purchase.
前不久，大理市卫生健康局拦截了“从云南省瑞丽市发往重庆市的9件口罩”，确实让人寒心，防疫越是吃劲，越要遵循和服从法律。
A short time ago, Dali City Health Bureau intercepted "from Ruili City, Yunnan Province to Chongqing City of nine masks," really chilling, the more strenuous epidemic prevention, the more to follow and obey the law.
但某个地区的不妥做法，将一个地方“全盘否定”也是片面的。
But the improper practices of one region, will be a place "total negation" is also one-sided.
比如，这次对滞留在云南的湖北游客雪中送炭，我身边的湖北人，都特别感谢和感动。
For example, this time to the stranded Hubei tourists in Yunnan, Hubei people around me, are particularly grateful and touched.
酒店工作人员正在做日常消毒据我了解，1月26日，云南省文化和旅游厅下发通知要求全省16个州市至少确定一家宾馆供疫区滞留在滇游客集中入住。
As far as I know, on January 26th, the Culture and Tourism Bureau of Yunnan Province issued a notice requesting that at least one guesthouse be set aside in 16 provinces and municipalities throughout the province for tourists to stay in Yunnan.
1月30日昆明市就已对外公布7家酒店作为集中安置观察点。
Kunming City on January 30 has announced that seven hotels as a centralized resettlement observation point.
目前共有2300余名滞留昆明游客被妥善安置，2月8日我们一家还吃到了酒店送的“暖心汤圆”，虽然身在他乡，却感受到家一样的温暖。
So far, more than 2,300 tourists stayed in Kunming for proper arrangements. On February 8, our family also ate the "Warm Heart Soup Yuan" from the hotel.
相比之下，我的一部分同乡们可能就没这么幸运，有一个探亲滞留外地的同事，入住酒店前，要拖家带口地去当地所在的街道办、治安大队，开健康证明，无形中增加了感染风险；还有的湖北游客被直接拒收，不得已找了家民宿栖身；我还在微博上看到，有个内蒙古人，因为用的是武汉手机号，平台就不让预定酒店；还有一个妈妈带着小孩去山东，因为上飞机的时候说了句武汉话，同行的人就不愿意和她们同一架飞机，没办法只能改签。
Some of my fellow countrymen, by contrast, may not be so lucky to have a colleague staying away from home to take their families to the local street office and security brigade and issue a health certificate, thus increasing the risk of infection.
我和朋友聊天，他深有感触地说，现在大家好像不是隔离病人，而是隔离武汉人。
I chat with friends, he said feelingly, now people do not seem to isolate patients, but isolation Wuhan people.
疫情发生在武汉，受害者首先是武汉市民，武汉的疫情并不是我们的错，其实我们也挺委屈的。
The outbreak occurred in Wuhan, the victims are Wuhan, the first city, Wuhan epidemic is not our fault, in fact, we also quite aggrieved.
这个春节，来昆明不过9天，却仿佛过了好久，我们想回家，希望疫情尽快好转，道路解封，我们就能回去和家人团聚了。
The Spring Festival comes to Kunming only for 9 days, but it seems like a long time. We want to go home.
