澎湃新闻记者 温潇潇因在抗击疫情一线感染新冠肺炎，2月20日21时50分，武汉市江夏区第一人民医院（又称“协和江南医院”）呼吸与危重症医学科三病区的医生彭银华，在武汉市金银潭医院去世，年仅29岁。

2月21日，在江夏区第一人民医院，多名医护人员向澎湃新闻（www.thepaper.cn）回忆，彭银华大约在1月24日（除夕）前后感觉身体不适，1月25日CT影像学显示肺部出现病灶，并入住本院进行全力治疗。

Someone wrote: "We all told ourselves that only by holding on can we let you see the light of victory.
你一直都在！”多名医护人员说，彭银华工作认真负责、谦虚好学，对病人尤其热情细心。

如果没有疫情发生，两人原计划于2月1日补办一场热热闹闹的婚礼。
If it hadn't been for the outbreak, the two men had planned to have a noisy second wedding on February 1.

坚持加班两天收治40名病人王迪黎是江夏区第一人民医院神经内科医生，疫情开始后一直在呼吸与危重症医学科支援，据他回忆，大约从1月19日起，科室开始全面收治新冠肺炎病人，紧急进行隔离改造，每天忙得团团转。
Wang Dili, a neurologist at Jiangxi's First People's Hospital, has been breathing and providing critical medical support since the outbreak began. About January 19, he recalled, the department began to treat patients with pneumonia, undergo emergency isolation and go about their daily routine.
他最后一次见到彭银华是1月22日：“那天他去拍CT，当时还没有任何症状。
The last time he saw Mr. Pang was on January 22: 'He went for a CT scan that day, and he didn't have any symptoms.
因为我们在发热门诊上班，大家为了安全，密切接触病人后都会去做CT。
Because we work in the fever clinic, we all do CT in order to be safe, close contact with patients.
”科室主任陈浩记得，1月25日，彭银华由于身体不适再次去拍CT，结果便显示肺部出现病灶，当天进入本院隔离病房接受治疗，此时距离全面收治病人还不到一周。
"Chen Hao, director of the department, recalled that on January 25, Peng Yinhua was admitted to the isolation ward of the hospital for treatment less than a week after receiving full treatment.
“我们这里是江夏区最大的综合医院，病人来了我们首先接诊，医院会尽量收治，实在没有床位再想办法。
"We are the largest general hospital in Jiangxia District. When patients come, we receive them first.
所以我们虽然不是定点医院，但是不比定点医院病人少。
So we're not ordering hospitals, but not less than scheduled hospitals.
”王迪黎说。
"said Wang.
同科室另一名胡姓负责人清楚记得，病人最多的时候，彭银华曾在病区坚持了两天两夜的工作，一个人收治了40个病人，上完班就病倒了。
Another head of the same department, Hu, clearly remembers that when the patient was at his peak, Mr. Peng worked two days and two nights in the sick area, treating 40 patients alone and falling ill after work.
据医院介绍，彭银华1990年12月出生，年仅29岁，2015年从湖北科技学院临床医学专业毕业后被江夏区第一人民医院录用，次年获得执业医师资格，2019年7月分配到该院呼吸与危重症医学科3病区，担任住院医师。

在追思留言本上，医护人员们纷纷留下对彭银华医生的惋惜和祝福。
In the memorial message book, the medical staff have left to the regret and blessing of Dr. Peng Yinhua.
澎湃新闻记者 温潇潇 图“彭银华的情况是最严重的”在胡姓负责人印象里，江夏区第一人民医院也有其他医护人员感染，不过暂时没有危重症，只有彭银华的情况是最严重的。
Peng Yinhua's situation is the most serious, "said Wen Xiaoxiao, a journalist at Peng Yinhua. In the impression of the official in charge of the hospital, there were other medical workers in the First People's Hospital in Jiangxia.
据她介绍，彭银华在本院接受过激素、抗病毒治疗、高流量吸氧，病情平稳后曾迅速加重，1月30日转入本院ICU。
According to her, Peng Yinhua received hormone, antiviral treatment, high-flow oxygen absorption, after the disease quickly increased, January 30 transferred to the Court ICU.
当天，彭银华经核酸检测呈阳性，确诊感染新冠肺炎，依规定转往定点医院金银潭医院。
On the same day, Peng Yinhua tested positive for nucleic acid, confirmed the infection with new crown pneumonia, according to the regulations transferred to the designated point hospital gold and silver pool hospital.
科室主任陈浩告诉澎湃新闻，彭银华住进金银潭医院后曾接受过血浆疗法。
Section director Chen Hao told Peng Pai news that Peng Yinhua had received plasma therapy after living in the gold and silver pool hospital.
来自新冠肺炎康复患者的300毫升血浆输送到他体内，但最终也没能挽救彭银华的生命。
300 ml of plasma from a convalescent patient with Newcomial Pneumonia was delivered to him, but it failed to save his life.
当被问及血浆疗法在哪些条件下才会有效，陈浩表示目前尚未了解更多案例，难以作出回答，只能继续观望。
Asked about the conditions under which plasma therapy would be effective, Chen said he did not know more cases to answer and would have to continue to wait and see.
彭银华去世前几天，王迪黎曾听说他进行了插管治疗：“一听说插管我们就觉得情况有点严重，我开始有一些不好的预兆了。
A few days before his death, Wang had heard that he had had an intubation: "We felt a little bit worse when we heard about the intubation and I began to have some bad omen.
”王迪黎说，插管治疗本身是一个很简单的操作，相对安全，但无论如何插管意味着病人肺功能很差，而且插管容易出现并发症，包括交叉感染、呼吸道损伤等等。
"Intubation itself is a relatively simple procedure and relatively safe," Wang said. "But intubation anyway means patients have poor lung function and are prone to complications, including cross-infection and respiratory injuries.
“突然昨晚说他走了，感觉有点接受不了。
"All of a sudden last night he said he was gone and felt a little overwhelmed.
但我们还得好好工作，不辜负他作出的牺牲。
But we still have to work hard and live up to the sacrifices he made.
”王迪黎说。
"said Wang.
好友：他只要看到病人好转就开心王迪黎与彭银华相识时间较长，后者刚来到医院实习时，王迪黎曾对其指点，因年龄较近，两人接触来往也比较多。
Friends: As soon as he saw the patient getting better, Wang Dili and Peng Yinhua met for a long time. When the latter first came to the hospital as an intern, Wang gave him some advice.
在王迪黎印象中，彭银华从实习期起，工作学习就很认真，一有时间就到科室来上班，即使休息也会来科室帮忙，看前辈们怎么处理救治病人，如果没有什么工作安排，他也会拿着教科书在科室学习：“我们病房都会有呼叫铃，每次呼叫铃响了，他就会放下手头工作，去病房询问病人哪里有不舒服，出来和我们汇报，看接下来怎么处理。
In Wang's impression, Peng Yinhua took his work seriously from his internship. Whenever he had time to come to the office, he would come to the office to help him even during the break.
”有一次，两人去市里学习，回来的地铁上，王迪黎问彭银华对做医生怎么看，彭银华回答，自己不指望挣多少钱，或者奢想怎样的生活，只要看到病人一天天好转，就觉得开心。
"Once when they went to study in the city and came back on the subway, Wang asked Peng Yinhua what he thought of becoming a doctor.
最让王迪黎印象深刻的是，医院曾有一位脑梗死偏瘫病人，不排除肾结核可能会传染，在病人家属无法到场陪检的情况下，彭银华主动提出陪病人检查，将病人搬上搬下，领取检查结果，再安全送回病房，折腾了2个小时。
What impressed Wang most was that the hospital had a hemiplegic patient with cerebral infarction. Without ruling out the possibility of infection with renal tuberculosis, Mr. Pang offered to accompany the patient for an examination.
王迪黎说：“这对他来说是经常做的事情。
"It's a constant thing for him to do," Wang said.
”彭银华实习期结束后，王迪黎记得，科室领导还曾专门嘱咐彭银华医院在招聘，建议他留在该院。
After his internship ended, Wang recalled that the head of the department had specifically instructed Peng Yinhua Hospital to recruit and advised him to stay.
神经内科医生胡珺虽与彭银华接触不多，但他也能感觉到，彭银华做事踏实，肯吃苦，是个“任劳任怨的实干者”，“让人很放心”。
Although the neurologist Hu Jun is not in contact with Peng Yinhua, he also feels that Peng Yinhua is a "hard worker" and "reassuring."
澎湃新闻了解到，疫情最初，江夏区第一人民医院医生紧缺，彭银华曾“白班加夜班”轮班倒，直到更多同事加入一线，持续紧绷的工作状态才得到缓解。
Peng Yinhua worked in shifts until more of his colleagues joined the frontline to relieve the strain of the epidemic, which began with a shortage of doctors at the First People's Hospital in Jiangxia.
大年三十，同事心疼他，劝他陪陪家人，他却说自己年轻，要让更多有家人的同事多休息。
Year 30, colleagues love him, advised him to accompany his family, he said he was young, to let more colleagues with family more rest.
婚纱照作微信头像，原定2月1日补办婚礼令同事们唏嘘不已的是，彭银华从年前就开始忙碌试婚纱、订酒店、发请柬，原本打算在2月1日（大年初八）与妻子补办一场热热闹闹的婚礼，却没想到疫情来得如此突然。
Peng Yinhua was busy experimenting with wedding dresses, booking hotels and sending out invitations. He had planned to have a hot wedding with his wife on February 1, but the outbreak came so suddenly.
有医护人员介绍，彭银华的妻子也曾在该院任职，后辞职在家，目前已有将近六个月身孕。
Medical staff introduced, Peng Yinhua's wife also served in the hospital, later resigned from home, has been nearly six months pregnant.
记者在医护人员们的手机中看到，彭银华的微信头像是自己和妻子的婚纱照。

2月2日，彭银华曾发布一条微信朋友圈，表达申请入党的愿望。
On February 2, Peng Yinhua had issued a micro-letter circle of friends, expressed the desire to join the party.
医院供图2月2日，彭银华还在金银潭医院治疗期间，曾向党组织申请入党，并打算等身体康复一些写入党申请书。
2007-9-25 21: 48 Peng Yinhua applied for membership of the Party organization during his treatment at the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital on February 2.
当天下午，他还发了一条微信朋友圈：“虽然只是一名普通的医生，但是我也要向这些积极分子学习，申请入党，在共产党带领下，打赢这场没有硝烟的战争。
On the afternoon of the same day, he sent out a circle of friends: "Although I was just an ordinary doctor, I had to learn from these activists, apply to join the Party and win the war without smoke under the leadership of the Communist Party

Someone wrote in the message book: "Eat your candy, but did not attend your wedding, the heart has been thinking that you will be better, but did not think... hope you will be fine, still sunny, we will continue to fight the fight!
