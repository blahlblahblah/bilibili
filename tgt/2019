”近日据多家香港媒体报道，香港潮流服饰零售商I.T集团在公司推行无薪假期计划，此前还有匿名员工透露，公司在2019年8月至年底共裁员300余人。
Hong Kong fashion retailer I.T Group has launched an unpaid leave scheme after anonymous employees said it had laid off more than 300 workers between August 2019 and the end of the year, according to Hong Kong media reports.
根据I.T内部邮件，2月至3月公司所有员工都将加入无薪假期计划。
According to I.T internal mail, all employees of the company will join the unpaid leave program from February to March.
除非有特殊安排，所有公司高层需放12天无薪假，总监和副总裁级别需放10天无薪假，其他月薪2万港元以上的员工需放7天无薪假，月薪2万港元以下则放4天无薪假。
12 days unpaid leave at senior level, 10 days unpaid leave at director and vice president level, 7 days unpaid leave at other salary levels above HK $20,000 per month and 4 days unpaid leave up to HK $20,000 per month, unless special arrangements exist.
除此之外，I.T从1月起施行无薪病假制度，即使员工获得医生证明也只能放无薪假，不能用年假抵消。
In addition, I.T introduced a system of unpaid sick leave in January, which allows employees to take unpaid leave even if they receive a medical certificate and cannot be offset by annual leave.
内部邮件显示，I.T集团从1月起施行无薪病假制度I.T集团在内部邮件中表示，目前的肺炎疫情和过去几个月发生在香港的抗议示威活动对公司的商业经营造成了严重打击，维持现金流是保护企业的关键，公司需要所有人的支持来度过这个极具挑战的时期。
In-house mail showed that I.T Group had implemented an unpaid sick leave system since January. I.T Group said in an internal email that the current pneumonia epidemic and the protests in Hong Kong over the past few months had dealt a severe blow to the company's business operations and that maintaining cash flow was key to protecting the company, which needed everyone's support to survive this challenging period.
由于新型冠状肺炎疫情，目前香港多家企业都开始推行无薪假，包括实惠集团、报道酒店、新巴城巴、富临集团、商业电台等。
Due to the new outbreak of coronary pneumonia, a number of companies in Hong Kong are now taking unpaid leave, including Affordable Group, Retail Hotels, Newcastle Pa, Fujian Group, Commercial Radio, etc.
界面时尚向I.T集团求证，截至发稿前尚未得到回应。
Interface fashion to I.T Group to verify, as of the draft has not received a response.
I.T集团曾是一代人的潮流时尚启蒙，但近几年业绩波动不断，整体呈持续下滑趋势。
I. T Group was a generation of trendy fashion enlightenment, but in recent years, the performance fluctuates constantly, the overall trend continued to decline.
中国内地市场曾是I.T集团的增长引擎，但从2013/14财年开始，I.T集团在内地的营业额增长率就从30%以上跌至20%以下，并且逐年下滑，2018/19财年内地营收增长仅录得6.4%。
The mainland market used to be the growth engine of I.T Group, but since the 2013 / 14 fiscal year, I.T's turnover in the Mainland has fallen from more than 30 per cent to less than 20 per cent, with annual declines and only 6.4 per cent growth recorded in the 2018 / 19 fiscal year.
I.T香港及澳门地区的业绩则在2018/19财年扭亏为盈，营收从一贯的下跌转为2.5%的上涨，日本及美国市场的零售同比增长更是达到11.5%。
I.T. 's performance in Hong Kong and Macau turned positive in the 2018 / 19 fiscal year, with revenue shifting from a consistent decline to a 2.5% gain, with retail sales in Japan and the US growing at 11.5% YoY.

2007-9-25 21: 48 I.T Group's own brand IZZUE London Fashion Week in Autumn / Winter 2019 Source: IZZUE But in today's uncertain environment, I.T Group's performance in mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau, Japan and the United States has all started to fall.
根据I.T集团于1月发布的2019/2020财年第三季度业绩报告，截至2019年11月30日的三个月内，港澳地区同店销售同比大跌33.3%，中国内地同店销售同比减少5.2%，日本及美国市场的同店销售则同比减少6.1%。
According to I.T Group's January 2019 / 2020 third-quarter results report, same-store sales in Hong Kong and Macao fell 33.3 per cent year-on-year over the three months to 30 November 2019, compared with 5.2 per cent year-on-year in mainland China and 6.1 per cent year on year in Japan and the United States.
当时I.T表示，港澳地区业绩下滑的主要原因是香港社会动荡导致游客锐减，中国内地业绩下滑则是因为公司控制了折扣促销活动，至于曾被认为能拉动业绩增长的日本和美国地区，则因为人民币汇率疲软导致中国游客减少消费。
At the time, I.T. said the main reason for the decline in Hong Kong and Macao was that Hong Kong's social unrest had led to a sharp drop in visitor arrivals, while mainland China's performance had fallen because of the company's control of discount promotions and, in Japan and the United States, where a weaker renminbi had been seen as a driver of growth, had led Chinese tourists to spend less.
过去几年，I.T大力推行的几项新措施似乎也收效甚微。
In the past few years, several of I.T. 's aggressive new initiatives also appear to have had little effect.
实体门店方面 ， I.T从2017年开始推出全新概念店，其中香港地区融合了时尚、食品饮品、鞋履、眼镜、美妆、生活方式产品的店铺概念受到当地消费者欢迎，这也是2018/19财年香港及澳门地区扭亏为盈的重要原因。
In terms of physical stores, I.T. launched a new concept store in 2017, in which Hong Kong's concept of shops incorporating fashion, food drinks, footwear, glasses, make-up and lifestyle products has been embraced by local consumers. This is an important reason for the turnaround in Hong Kong and Macao in the 2018 / 19 financial year.
但在内地，blue block、red room、green gallery等新的店铺概念并未起到香港市场那样扭转业绩的反响。
In the Mainland, however, new store concepts such as blueblock, redroom and green gallery have not had the same impact on performance as the Hong Kong market.
线上方面，I.T官方电商平台ITeSHOP在2017年重装上线，随后正式入驻微信推出小程序商城。
On-line, ITeSHOP, the official I.T e-commerce platform, was relaunched in 2017, followed by a microphone launch.
最近的疫情使众多时尚品牌在线上举办促销活动，ITeSHOP小程序也在2月13日至2月14日推出多件产品打折活动。
The recent epidemic has prompted numerous fashion brands to launch promotions online, and the ITeSHOP gadget launched several product discounts from February 13 to 14.
