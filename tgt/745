_记者| 王晓珊  实习生 | 甘笠男编辑 | 盛倩玉黄冈市黄梅县大河镇袁夫稻田 水稻地2月6日，湖北省正式出台17条财税支持政策，从落实相关税收政策、支持农副产品和医护物资供给、实施农贸市场经营户摊位租金补贴、推动无接触餐饮配送行业发展等4个方面入手，保障疫情防控物资供应，鼓励企业支持疫情防控，确保群众生活物资供应等。
Yuan Farm Rice Fields, Huangmei County, Huangmei County, Hubei Province on February 6 officially announced 17 fiscal support policies to guarantee supply of disease prevention and control materials, encourage enterprises to support disease prevention and control, and ensure the supply of goods and materials to the public.
2月8日，湖北省政府办公厅下发通知，从减轻企业负担、强化金融支持、加大财税支持、加大稳岗支持等四方面入手，出台18项措施。
On February 8, the office of the Hubei provincial government issued a circular announcing 18 measures to ease the burden on enterprises, strengthen financial support, increase financial and tax support and increase support for the stable post.
相关政策即日起施行，有效期暂定6个月对承租国有资产类经营用房的中小企业，3个月房租免收、6个月房租减半。
The relevant policies shall take effect immediately, with a provisional validity period of 6 months For small and medium-sized enterprises renting State-owned assets, rent is waived for three months and rent is halved for six months.
对受疫情影响严重的小微企业，担保费率降至1%以下，再担保费减半。
For micro and small enterprises severely affected by the epidemic, the guaranteed rate is reduced to less than 1 per cent and additional premiums halved.
企业裁员（减员）率不高于5.5%的，返还上年度实际缴纳失业保险费的70%。
If the reduction rate is not higher than 5.5%, 70% of the unemployment insurance premium actually paid in the previous year shall be returned.
相关支持政策的颁布对小微企业而言或如甘露，对于生产不能中断农资企业而言，可暂解燃眉之急。
The promulgation of related support policies for micro and small enterprises or such as mannose, for the production of agricultural enterprises can not interrupt the immediate needs of agricultural enterprises.
然而，春耕生产在即，但当前仍未出现防控疫情的拐点，有经营水稻种子销售及种植的企业表示，目前种子供应处于停顿状态，春耕生产与种子供应问题亟待解决。
However, spring plough production is imminent, but there is still no inflection point for the prevention and control of the epidemic. Enterprises dealing in the sale and cultivation of rice seeds say the supply of seeds is at a standstill.
与此同时，有蔬菜农业生产基地和企业在接受南都周刊记者采访时表示，受新冠肺炎疫情影响，田里蔬菜无法及时收割与销售，焦心未来收入存在中断风险。
Meanwhile, vegetable farms and enterprises told Nandu Weekly reporters that the impact of the new crown pneumonia, the vegetables in the field can not be harvested and sold in time, worried about the risk of future revenue disruption.
农业复工仍待安排农业生产对于农民而言是头等大事，湖北省黄冈市黄梅县农业局对此感到焦心不已。
The resumption of agricultural work is still to be arranged for farmers is a top priority, Huangmei County, Huanggang City, Huangmei County, Huangmei City about this worry.
“现在各个村都已封村，乡镇之间严令禁止进出，水稻种植虽然还没到时间，但从目前来看都无法开展。
"Villages are now sealed off, access is strictly forbidden between townships and rice cultivation, although not yet time-bound, is not yet possible.
”农业局工作人员在电话采访中提到，“当前除了保障人们基本生活所需要的蔬菜、畜禽的饲料，其他的生产暂无法保障。
"There is no guarantee that we will be able to produce anything other than the vegetables and animal feed that people need for their basic livelihood," the agency's staff said in a telephone interview.
”黄冈市黄梅县大河镇袁夫稻田 水稻地湖北吉姥爷农业科技股份有限公司（以下简称“吉姥爷农业“），董事长刘元成这个春节过得也并不舒心，“榨菜估计今年要全部烂在地里。
Huangmei County Huangmei County Yuan Fu rice paddies rice field Hubei Jiye Agricultural Technology Co. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Ji Ye agriculture"), chairman Liu Yuan-cheng this Spring Festival has not been comfortable, "estimated that all the gravy will rot in the ground this year.
”吉姥爷农业榨菜地吉姥爷农业位于荆州监利县白螺镇，现有达1800亩的蔬菜生产基地，与当地500多家农户签订收购订单，还成立了大善人蔬菜种植专业合作社，统一为合作农户提供种子肥料及技术指导。
"" My grandfather farming is located in BaiLuo Town, Jingzhou county, where 1,800 mu of vegetable production is located. He has signed purchase orders with more than 500 farmers there, and has set up special cooperative farmers to provide seed fertilizer and technical guidance to cooperative farmers.
去年八月种上的榨菜，现在已经到了收割的时节。
It is time to harvest the vegetables which were planted last August.
往年这个时候，田里的工人忙得歇不下脚，采摘、收购来的榨菜要赶紧送到工厂进行腌制、深加工，变成一罐罐的酱菜，销往全国各地。
At this time of year, workers in the fields are too busy to rest, and the squeeze from the picking and buying should be rushed to the factory for pickling and deep-processing, turning into jars of pickles to be sold all over the country.
村里的蔬菜种植专业合作社加上工厂，前后有200多人参加劳动。
The village vegetable growing professional cooperative plus factory, before and after more than 200 people to participate in the work.
吉姥爷农业榨菜地然而，如今面对自种蔬菜基地里的538亩绿油油的榨菜田，刘成元却无计可施，“摘不了，因为疫情，现在工人都不敢出门”，只能眼睁睁地看着叶子变老、发黄。
However, now facing the 538 acres of green vegetable fields planted on his vegetable base, Liu Chengyuan has no choice but to "catch the disease, because the workers are afraid to go out," and can only watch the leaves grow old and yellow.
再迟十天半个月，蔬菜基地里榨菜就要全部报废，村里500多家农户可能面临蔬菜变质、无人收购的处境。
Another half a month later, the vegetable base will be completely wiped out, more than 500 farmers in the village may face the situation of vegetable spoilage, no one to buy the situation.
仓库里的酱菜存货已经所剩无几，没有新鲜榨菜、缺少工人，再加上高速封路，公司的生产、销售也不得不跟着停滞。
With little stock of pickles left in the warehouse, no fresh vegetables, no workers, and high-speed road closures, the company's production and sales had to stagnate.
他估计，如果疫情迟迟不解除，将给公司造成高达一百多万的亏损，约占往年利润20%。
He estimates that if the epidemic continues unchecked, it will cost the company more than a million dollars, or about 20% of profits in previous years.
吉姥爷农业榨菜地去年腊月，吉姥爷农业已经提前购买了一千来斤辣椒种子，为夏季作物种植做准备。
Last December, Grandpa Gi had bought about a thousand kilos of chili seeds in advance to prepare for the summer crops.
虽然疫情可能造成播种日期推迟，导致辣椒产量下降，但相比之下，即将烂在地里的榨菜才是刘元成最为忧心的。
Although the outbreak may have delayed planting dates, leading to a drop in chilli production, Liu Yuancheng was the most worried about the impending milking of vegetables in the ground.
面临相同困境的还有湖北咸宁嘉鱼县潘家湾镇。
Faced with the same dilemma in Hubei Xianning Jiayu County Panjiawan town.
潘家湾是全国重点蔬菜基地，以蔬菜产业作为农村经济的支柱产业，2018年全镇蔬菜面积已达10万亩。
Panjiawan is the country's key vegetable base, vegetables industry as the backbone of the rural economy, 2018 the town's vegetable area has reached 100,000 mu.
通常情况下，每年下半年种植的白菜、甘蓝、扁包菜可以从10月下旬，一直收获到来年4月。
Typically, cabbage, kale and flat cabbage grown in the second half of the year can be grown from late October to April.
嘉鱼周志蔬菜基地的负责人覃耀庭告诉记者，正常情况下，正月初五、初六就该开工了，但今年因为疫情的影响，复工遥遥无期。
Jiayi Zhou Zhi vegetable base responsible for Tanaka told reporters that under normal circumstances, January 5, 6 should start, but this year due to the impact of the epidemic, resume work is far away.
另一方面，拉蔬菜的车子也较往年更不好找，“我们老百姓也没有办法，蔬菜我们拉不了，那还不是要在地里烂了，有啥办法呢？”覃耀庭说。
On the other hand, the cart with vegetables is harder to find than usual. "We have no choice, vegetables we can't pull, that's not rotten in the field, what can we do?" Tanaka said.
春耕备种需早日跟上往年今日，仙桃市诺嘉绿色农业有限公司（以下简称“诺嘉农业”），已经开始对种子进行加工和包装，等待着年后将货物发往签订合同的农户手中，等到春耕时分，则可以开始进行播种。
Spring ploughing needs to catch up with previous years today, and Sendricia Nojia Green Agriculture Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Nojia Agriculture") has begun processing and packaging seeds, waiting for the goods to be distributed to the contracted farmers in the next year, when the seeds can be sown.
诺嘉农业310亩示范园全景该公司主要负责水稻全产业链的开发，然而，疫情发生后，诺嘉农业遭遇了春耕供种运输不畅的困境。
The company is mainly responsible for the development of the whole industrial chain of rice. However, after the outbreak of the epidemic, Nojaya agriculture suffered from poor spring ploughing for seed transportation.
为了防止感染人数进一步扩散，湖北省实行严格的疫情隔离措施，实施全省封城堵路，非防疫物资、生活物资交通运输全部停止，种子无法运送到县、乡及农户手中。
In order to prevent further spread of infection, Hubei Province has implemented strict quarantine measures, blocked roads throughout the province, stopped transportation of non-epidemic materials and supplies, and prevented the delivery of seeds to counties, townships and farmers.
2020年春节放假较往年提前，湖北大多数种子企业于春节假期前进行种子包装，诺嘉农业表示，当前企业加工数量仅占春耕生产供种量的20%～30%，春耕备种存在很大的缺口。
Most seed companies in Hubei carry out seed packaging ahead of the Spring Festival holiday in 2020, and Nojia Agriculture says the amount of processing now accounts for only 20 to 30 percent of the supply for spring ploughing, which leaves a large gap.
“我们企业提供育秧、插秧和农技服务，这些所有的准备基本上都要从二月中下旬开始着手，三月初就要开始进行育秧的一些工作。
"We are providing seedling-raising, transplanting and agro-technical services in our enterprises, and all these preparations will basically start in the middle and second half of February, and some seedling-raising work will begin in early March.
备种不足会影响一部分种业销售及农耕的事情。
A lack of seed stock can affect some seed sales and farming.
”诺嘉农业董事长李寒对记者说道。
"Nokia chairman Li Han told reporters.
遭遇春耕难题的还有袁夫稻田（湖北）农业发展有限公司（以下简称“袁夫稻田”）。
The problem of spring ploughing also encountered Yuan Fu rice field (Hubei) Agricultural Development Co. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Yuan Fu rice field").
黄冈市黄梅县大河镇袁夫稻田 小麦地“我们原来想做一些春天的水稻播种，但是现在因为封城封村，所有人都不许外出，我们现在也无法请到工人工作。
Yuan Farm Wheat Fields in Huangmei County Huangmei County, Huanggang City We wanted to make some spring rice to sow, but now because the city is closed to everyone, we are unable to hire workers.
”袁夫稻田创始人袁勇刚对记者说道，“除水稻外，我们还有一些蔬菜的耕种，现在同样是没法进行。
Yuan Yonggang, founder of the rice field, told reporters: "We also have some vegetable farming, which is not possible now.
”袁勇刚表示，因为公司还有其他板块业务，运营成本不低，如果疫情到4月份仍未缓解，公司就无法再支撑下去，“3月初能够复工的话公司的损失大约在100万左右，若是持续到4月份，公司则会扩大亏损至300万。
Mr Yuan said the company would not be able to sustain the epidemic if it did not ease by April, because it had other operations, and that "if it could resume work in early March, it would lose about one million dollars, and if it continued into April, it would run a loss of three million."
”黄冈市黄梅县大河镇袁夫稻田 水稻地疫情后虾稻行业或受影响监利县位于湖北省中南部，江汉平原南端，境内河网、湖泊密布，素有“全国稻米第一县”之称， 后大力发展“稻虾连作”，小龙虾产量曾连续多年稳居湖北省第一，获得“中国小龙虾第一县”的美名。
"Yuan River rice field rice field Huangmei County Huanggang City after the rice field epidemic situation Shrimp rice industry or the affected county in the southern end of Hubei Province, Jianghan Plain, known as the" National Rice First County, "after the development of" rice and shrimp continuous cultivation, "small lobster production has been stable in Hubei Province for many years, won the" China lobster first county.
但是，由于疫情持续，该县小龙虾投种、养殖受到不小的影响。
However, due to the ongoing epidemic, the county lobster cast, farming was not small impact.
监利县杨水湖 龙虾养殖池监利县杨水湖虾稻种养专业合作社负责人黄中华称，往年三、四月份小龙虾就上市了，年后这段时间正好处于小龙虾的成长期，然而，如今缺乏饲料，没有办法喂养小龙虾。
Yellow China, head of the Yangshui Lake lobster culture pool in Ningli county, said the crayfish had been on the market in March and April of the previous year.
“去年，该县不少养殖户已将池塘里的龙虾售空，并没有保留虾种。
"Last year, a number of farmers in the county sold out lobster in the pond and did not keep shrimp.
现在人员流动受限，新虾苗无从购买，继而导致新一轮养殖活动无法开展。
Restrictions on the movement of people now prevent the purchase of new shrimp seedlings, which in turn prevents a new round of farming activities.
”黄中华告诉记者。
Huang told reporters.
黄中华说，如果疫情影响持续到3月份以后，合作社300多的亩稻虾田每亩地将损失上千元，“我们农民本身就是以此生活，没法开工就没收入。
If the epidemic continues beyond March, the cooperative's 300 mu of rice and shrimp fields will lose thousands of yuan per acre of farmland.
”监利县杨水湖 龙虾养殖池湖北是我国虾稻种植的主要地区，据中国农业网介绍，2019年湖北稻渔综合种养总面积达到680万亩，居全国第一，18个县市稻渔综合种养面积超过10万亩。
According to the China Agriculture Network, the total area under comprehensive rice cultivation in 2019 reached 6.8 million mu, the highest in the country, with more than 100,000 mu of comprehensive rice and fish culture in 18 counties and cities.
2019年，湖北省虾稻种养面积大幅增加，使得湖北的小龙虾产量也有所增加。
In 2019, shrimp cultivation in Hubei Province increased significantly, resulting in an increase in crayfish production in Hubei Province.
根据农业部发布的《小龙虾产业发展报告（2019）》，湖北2019年总产量为81.24万吨，排名全国第一，其产量约占全国总产量的一半（49.58%）。
According to the report on the development of the crayfish industry (2019) issued by the Ministry of Agriculture, Hubei Province produced 812,400 tons in 2019, the highest in the country, accounting for about half (49.58 per cent) of the country's total production.
解决资金压力成为迫切问题当前不少受访企业表示，解决资金压力仍是当前最迫切的问题。
Solving the funding crunch is still the most pressing issue, according to a number of companies interviewed.
袁勇刚表示，在农业中很多东西都有免税，收税的板块税负也不会太高，主要压力源于银行贷款，若未来银行贷款能够根据实际情况进行递延，将能减缓部分企业压力。
Yuan said that many things in agriculture are tax-free, the plate tax is not too high, the main pressure comes from bank loans, if future bank loans can be deferred, will alleviate some of the corporate pressure.
蔬菜基地有关负责人则希望早日解决农耕人手缺乏与销售问题，从而减少损失。
Vegetable managers hope to solve the shortage of farm workers and sales problems at an early date, thereby reducing losses.
湖北是全国闻名的鱼米之乡，在古代就有“湖广熟、天下足”的说法。
Hubei is a famous country of fish and rice, in ancient times there has been "Huguan ripe, the world foot" said.
湖北省人民政府办公厅文件显示，湖北农业以种植业为主体，种植业又以粮食、棉花生产为主，被称为“粮棉大省“。
Hubei Province People's Government Office documents, Hubei agriculture as the main body of farming, crop production and cotton production, known as "large grain and cotton provinces."
根据国家统计局公布数据，2019年湖北粮食总产量为545亿斤左右。
The total grain output of Hubei Province in 2019 was about 54.5 billion jin, according to figures released by the State Statistics Bureau.
湖北省两次发布财税支持政策后，不少企业和农民都期待能够迅速实现好转，减少中间流通环节，不误农时，帮助农业生产平稳、顺利过渡。
After the two fiscal support policies were issued in Hubei Province, many enterprises and farmers expect to see rapid improvement, reduce the intermediate circulation links and help smooth and smooth the transition of agricultural production.
