。
.
有鼓励我的，也有批评我的。
Some are encouraging me, others are criticizing me.
我想了一个晚上，我就是一本书啊。
I've been thinking all night. I'm a book.

但是因为还有更悲剧的事情在后面等着我，我是指我的饭店和债务，所以我觉得这个悲剧也不算什么。
But because there are more tragic things to come, I mean my hotel and my debts, so I don't think this tragedy is worth anything.

同样的，还有人觉得，大家之所以觉得我幽默，因为我用调侃的、段子式的口吻讲悲催的经历。

和饭店、债务比起来，这真不算悲催。
Compared with the hotel, debt, this is not a sad rush.

.
对于外界的关注，我不习惯，也不喜欢。
I am not used to and do not like the outside world.
外界的关注并不能减轻我的痛苦和经济负担。
