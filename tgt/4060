燃财经（ID:rancaijing）原创作者 | 金玙璠编辑 | 魏佳疫情以来，所有企业都在喊“太难了”，但在苹果公司面前这都不算事儿。
Ever since the outbreak of Wei Jia, the original creator of Flaming Finance (ID: Rancaijing), everyone has been shouting, "It's too difficult," but it's nothing in front of Apple.
当地时间3月18日，美股低开不断下挫，盘中标普500指数达7%，触发10天（8个交易日）内第4次熔断，也是美股历史上第5次熔断。
On March 18, U.S. stocks fell lower, hitting an intraday S & P 500 index of 7%, triggering the fourth meltdown in 10 days (8 trading days) and the fifth in U.S. stock history.
此前4次美股熔断分别发生于1997年10月27日以及2020年3月9日、3月12日、3月16日。
The four previous meltdowns occurred on October 27, 1997, March 9, March 12, and March 16, 2020.
比美股第5次熔断来得更早一些的，是苹果于18日悄悄上线4款新品，iPad Pro、MacBook Air、Mac mini以及适配新款iPad Pro的Magic Keyboard。
The earlier of the five meltdowns was Apple's new iPad Pro, MacBook Air and Mac Mini, as well as Magic Keyboard, the new iPad Pro gadget.
新品发布释放的是苹果供应链正在恢复的信号，但这剂强心针一样捞不回被熔掉的市值。
The release of the new product is a sign that Apple's supply chain is recovering, but it will not recapture the lost market value.
从美股今年第一次熔断到第四次熔断（3月9日-18日），短短10天里，苹果蒸发市值1853亿美元。
From its first meltdown this year to its fourth meltdown (March 9-18), Apple's evaporated market value reached $185.3 billion in just 10 days.
其中3月16日，苹果股价下跌12.86%，单日跌幅创下2008年9月29日金融危机以来新高，以收盘价计，市值一日内蒸发了1564亿美元。
On March 16, Apple's stock fell 12.86%, its one-day drop to a record since the financial crisis of September 29, 2008, evaporating $156.4 billion in one day at closing price.
苹果多少受到了大盘和科技股集体下跌的大环境的影响，但利空消息频频冲击下，3月20日苹果股价收于229.24美元，对比2月12日创下的327.22美元的高位，5周时间里跌幅近30%，总市值从14316.57亿美元降至10029.25亿美元，被抹去了4287亿美元。
Apple was hurt more or less by the overall market and the overall decline in technology stocks, but its shares closed at $229.24 on March 20, down nearly 30% in five weeks from a high of $327.22 on February 12, and its total market value fell to $102.925 billion from $143.657 billion, erasing $428.7 billion.
近六个月以来苹果股价走势经过这一轮调整，苹果虽然还身在万亿美元市值俱乐部里，但显然也经不起折腾了。
Apple's stock price has changed in the past six months, and while it is still in the trillion-dollar market-value club, it certainly can't stand the pinch.
2020年疫情发生以来，苹果麻烦不断，供应链复工困难、门店关闭、出货量下降，春季新品发布会、WWDC均被迫延期，5G手机大概率跳票，近两周内三次被罚款累计达180亿元……业内人士对燃财经表示，2020年，将成为苹果诞生以来最艰难的一年。
Apple has been in trouble since the 2020 epidemic, with supply chains struggling to get back on track, stores closing, shipments down, spring launches and WWDC all having to be postponed, 5G cellphones jumping and fined 18 billion yuan three times in the past two weeks.
一个月前（2月17日）苹果就发布警告：由于全球iPhone供应量下降以及营收下降，可能无法实现季度营收预期。
A month ago (Feb. 17), Apple warned it might not be able to meet quarterly revenue expectations because of the global decline in iPhone supply and revenue.
闭店潮至少持续2个月苹果失去9成门店如果梳理苹果自2月初所面临的窘境，上半部分发生在中国，下半部分则蔓延到除此以外的所有市场。
Apple Loses at least 2 Months Apple Loses 9 out of 10 stores If Apple carves up the mess it has faced since early February, the first half is in China and the second half spreads to all other markets.
在超过一个月的休市期后，苹果在大中华区的42家Apple Store零售店陆续改成限时营业模式，营业时间多数缩短至8小时以内（以前营业时间通常为12个小时）。
After a more than one-month hiatus, Apple's 42 Apple Store stores in Greater China have been converted to a time-limited business model, with most of the opening hours reduced to less than eight hours (compared with the previous 12).
3月14日，苹果公司CEO蒂姆·库克在推特上宣布，除大中华地区外的所有苹果零售店关闭。
On March 14, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced on Twitter that all Apple stores outside Greater China would be closed.
也就是说，全球511家苹果零售店如今只有位于中国的42家开门营业，这给苹果带来的损失将远超过1-2月份。
In other words, only 42 of the world's 511 retail outlets are now open in China, causing Apple much more damage than it did in January-February.
一方面，彼时只是中国区业绩受损，如今则是全球性的，而且目前海外疫情严重的地区对于苹果而言至关重要。
On the one hand, it was only China that suffered, but now it is global, and the region that is now suffering from a severe overseas epidemic is critical for Apple.
综合苹果2020财年一季报业绩的区域销售来看，大中华区市场录得收入135.78亿美元，占总收入918.19亿美元的14.8%；其他市场贡献营收则占85.2%，其中收入占比第一、第二的美国和欧洲市场分别贡献营收413.67亿美元、232.73亿美元，加起来约占公司净利润的一半以上。
Aggregate regional sales of Apple's quarterly results for fiscal year 2020, the Greater China market recorded $13,578 million, or 14.8% of total revenue of $91.819 billion, while other market contributions accounted for 85.2%, with U.S. and European markets contributing $41.367 billion and $23.273 billion, combined, accounting for more than half of the company's net profit.
苹果2020财年一季报各区域销售占比最初，库克称这一轮闭店只持续到3月27日，但3月18日，苹果官方宣布，无限期关闭大中华地区以外的所有零售店，开业时间另行通知。
Apple reports regional sales for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. Cook said the shutdown lasted only until March 27, but on March 18, Apple officials announced that all retail stores outside Greater China would be closed indefinitely until further notice.
这意味着，92%的苹果门店、约85%的市场不知何时才能恢复正常秩序。
That means that 92% of Apple stores and about 85% of the market won't be able to return to order again.
有分析认为，苹果全球各地的门店重新营业时间，取决于美国和欧洲的感染高峰何时出现。
Some analysts say Apple stores around the world are reopening depending on when infection peaks occur in the U.S. and Europe.
但现在欧洲已经成为疫情“大流行”的中心，从扩散趋势看，美国正在紧跟欧洲。
But now that Europe has become the epicentre of an epidemic, the US is following Europe's lead in terms of proliferation trends.
另一方面，尽管库克表示在线商店继续开放，但即便是电商发展速度居于世界前列的中国，单靠线上部分，iPhone销量都被砍掉了60%，更别提销售渠道以线下为主的欧美市场了。
On the other hand, while Cook says online stores remain open, even in China, one of the world's fastest-growing telecoms companies, iPhone sales have been slashed by 60% on the online side alone, not to mention offline sales in the U.S. and Europe.
3月9日，中国信通院公布的数据显示，国内手机市场2月份iPhone出货量约49万部，同比下滑了62%（77万部），环比下滑78%（182万部），而1月份数据还在正常范围内，即200多万部。
On March 9, China's Information and Communications Technology Institute reported that the domestic cellphone market shipped about 490,000 iPhones in February, down 62% (770,000) year-on-year, down 78% (1.82 million units) from January's figure of more than 2 million.
数据下滑的影响因素包括疫情下的闭店及对消费的冲击，这两点同样适用于苹果的海外市场。
The factors behind the decline include closures and the impact on consumption, both of which apply to Apple's overseas markets.
根据外媒报道，美国著名研究型风险投资公司Loup Ventures的分析师吉恩·蒙斯特表示，苹果的零售店销售额的很大一部分将转移到网上，从而使得门店关闭导致的收入下降将仅为约1%，即约1亿美元的损失。
According to foreign media reports, Gene Monster, an analyst at Loup Ventures, a leading US research venture capital firm, says a large portion of Apple's retail sales will be transferred online, leaving only about 1 per cent, or about $100 million, in lost revenue as a result of the store closures.
华尔街投行韦德布什（Wedbush）证券公司的分析师丹·艾维斯认为，关闭门店将使苹果本季度营收减少约5%。
Dan Elvis, an analyst at Wall Street investment bank Wedbush, said closing the store would cut revenue by about 5% this quarter.
国内的通信专家康钊则认为闭店带来的冲击会更大：大多数西方人更喜欢在实体店购买商品，尤其是手机这类电子产品，线下销售占比更大。
Cong Zhao, a domestic communications expert, said the impact would be greater: most Westerners prefer to buy goods in physical stores, especially electronics such as mobile phones, with offline sales larger.
在美国波士顿居住3年的李昂告诉燃财经，一个普通快递写的是3-5天，但是因为周末、节假日快递不给配送，平均要等10天左右才能收到，同时由于当地邮费高企（起步价10-15美元，次日达、送货上门都要加钱），她和周围人的苹果产品都是从线下零售店购买的。
Li Ang, who has lived in Boston for three years, tells Flammax that an ordinary courier writes three to five days, but it takes an average of about 10 days to receive because of weekend and holiday couriers, and because of high local postage rates (starting at $10 to $15 and surcharged the next day for deliveries), she and those around her buy Apple products from off-line retailers.
不出意外，苹果公司今年上半年的业绩主要靠中国市场了，而如今急于开门迎客，也是瞄准了疫情后市场需求的反弹。
Unsurprisingly, Apple's first-half results were largely driven by the Chinese market, and its eagerness to open its doors is also aimed at a post-epidemic rebound in demand.
不过，这里的成绩显然无法让库克满意。
However, the results here are clearly not satisfactory to Cook.
3月19日，燃财经走访了苹果位于北京华贸的门店，店内除了店员外，只有1名顾客。
On March 19, Flaming Finance paid a visit to an Apple store in Beijing with only one customer in addition to a clerk.
手机柜台的销售人员表示，和春节前相比，顾客减少了7成左右，销售额大幅下滑，大部分客户是来维修产品的。
Sales staff at the mobile-phone counters said that compared with the pre-Spring Festival holiday, there were about 70 percent fewer customers, with sales dropping sharply and most customers coming to service their products.
“大多数顾客不愿意碰柜台上的样机。
"Most customers don't want to touch the prototype on the counter.
”该店员说。
"said the clerk.
2月中旬，苹果发布2020第二财季业绩预警，提示新一季度的财报将难达预期，主要原因是供应受阻和中国智能手机需求量下降。
In mid-February, Apple issued an early warning for fiscal second quarter 2020, warning that earnings for the new quarter would fall short of expectations, mainly because of supply disruptions and falling demand for smartphones in China.
艾维斯随后在一份报告中指出，“在这场史无前例的疫情中，iPhone销量所受到的影响会在3月发布的财报中呈现出来。
In a subsequent report, Mr. Elvis said: 'In this unprecedented epidemic, the impact on iPhone sales will be reflected in the March results.
”他预估，iPhone销售同比下滑可能超过50%，主要原因是供应链大量受阻以及中国市场需求的下滑。
He estimated that iPhone sales could fall more than 50% YoY, largely because of a massive supply chain disruption and falling demand in China.
疫情波及全球供应链苹果销售继续受挫疫情凶猛，身为营收高度依赖硬件的科技公司，苹果供应链深受影响，严重拖累新品的生产和交付，继续波及销量。
Apple's sales continue to be battered by the global supply chain, where Apple, a technology company that relies heavily on hardware for revenue, has been hit hard, crippling production and delivery and continuing to spill over into sales.
3月9日，据《纽约邮报》报道，受疫情影响，苹果全球供应链紧张，纽约手机零售商的iPhone11库存严重不足。
Apple's global supply chain is tight, and iPhone 11, a New York cellphone retailer, is severely under-stocked, the New York Post reported on March 9.
在苹果2020年第一季度电话会议上，苹果公司称，苹果手表、iPad、iPhone甚至苹果电脑的硬件生产均受到了一定程度的冲击。
On Apple's first-quarter 2020 conference call, Apple said the hardware production of Apple watches, iPads, iPhones and even Apple PCs had been hit to some extent.
而据公开资料，苹果公司的产品中有90%以上的产能来自中国大陆。
More than 90% of Apple's production comes from mainland China, according to open sources.
3月15日，央视《新闻联播》节目中报道了富士康郑州工厂的复工情况：80%以上的员工已复工，已开始正常向苹果等国际手机厂商供货。
On March 15, CCTV's "News Network" program reported the resumption of work at Foxconn's Zhengzhou factory: more than 80 percent of workers have returned to work and are now supplying international cellphone makers such as Apple.
不过苹果方面的判断并不乐观，其在第二财季业绩预警中分析，虽然中国各地开始复工，但是恢复正常状态的速度慢于预期，全球iPhone供应将暂时受到限制，同时也将暂时影响全球收入。
But Apple's judgment is not encouraging, as it analysed in its second-quarter earnings warning that, while work is starting to resume across China, the pace of return to normal is slower than expected, global iPhone supply will be temporarily limited and global revenues will be temporarily affected.
来源 / 新闻联播早前，苹果公司也试图将组装业务转移到海外。
Source / News Broadcast Earlier, Apple was also trying to move its assembly business overseas.
《华尔街日报》3月3日发表苹果中国供应链报告，披露早在2015年苹果公司运营主管就建议应该“将至少一种产品的组装转移到越南”，这样可以让苹果在中国以外的地方开展“工人培训并建立新的零部件供应商体系”，但当时遭到苹果高层拒绝。
In the Wall Street Journal's March 3 report on China's supply chain, Apple's chief operating officer suggested as early as 2015 that 'assembly of at least one product should be moved to Vietnam,' which would allow Apple to 'train workers and build a new supplier system for parts outside China,' but Apple executives declined.
苹果的供应链体系遍布全球。
Apple has a global supply chain.
苹果2019年公布的200大核心供应商名单显示，中国台湾供应商数量为46家，美国40家，中国（大陆+香港）40家，日本供应商39家，韩国供应商14家。
According to a list of 200 core suppliers published by Apple in 2019, China has 46 suppliers in Taiwan, 40 in the US, 40 in China (mainland + Hong Kong), 39 in Japan and 14 in the Republic of Korea.
德国占3%，新加坡、奥地利、英国等国家占8%。
Germany accounted for 3 per cent and Singapore, Austria, the United Kingdom and others accounted for 8 per cent.
这200大供应商，在全球有807家工厂。
The 200 largest suppliers have 807 plants worldwide.
除中国以外的其他国家和地区均受疫情波及正处于爆发期，带来的不利影响已经蔓延至欧洲和日韩的苹果供应商。
Countries and regions other than China have been affected by the outbreak and are in the midst of an outbreak, with adverse effects spreading to Apple suppliers in Europe and Japan and South Korea.
以韩国为例，三星系的三星电子和LG系的LG Innotek和LG Display都是苹果核心供应商。
In South Korea, for example, Samsung Electronics in three galaxies and LG Innotek and LG Display are core Apple suppliers.
据外媒报道，三星电子位于韩国东南部城市龟尾（Gumi）的工厂自2月21日开始出现第一例新冠确诊病例，至3月2日已出现4例，导致该工厂生产线已数次停运；iPhone相机模块供应商LG Innotek因员工被确诊感染新型冠状病毒，关闭了龟尾A1工厂；苹果的OLED手机屏供应商LG Display原计划在3月3日恢复生产，但日前由于工厂附近一名银行职员确诊，暂时关停了位于韩国龟尾市的手机屏幕工厂，复工时间还无法确定。
According to foreign media reports, Samsung Electronics' factory in the southeastern South Korean city of Gumi has seen its first confirmed case since Feb. 21 and four cases by March 2, leading to the shutdown of the factory's A1 plant.
据艾维斯分析，苹果公司因疫情被破坏的供应链，最早将于4月底或5月初恢复全部产能，最晚要到5月下旬或6月才能完全恢复正常。
According to Elvis' analysis, Apple's supply chain, disrupted by the outbreak, will restore full capacity as early as the end of April or the beginning of May, and will not return to full normality until late May or June at the latest.
与此同时，苹果也通过砍单策略来及时止损。
At the same time, Apple also through the chopping strategy to stop the loss.
由于受延迟复工的影响，苹果的重要供应商伯恩光学，因复工率较低，大量员工3月中才能投入产线，影响到交货进度，拖累了整个iPhone 11的正常出货。
Due to the delayed resumption of work, Bourne Optics, Apple's main supplier, was unable to go into production until mid-March because of low reactivation rates, which affected delivery schedules and delayed regular shipments of the entire iPhone 11.
于是，3月13日市场有传言苹果将缩减iPhone 11的面板订单，这也直接导致了其供应商日本显示器公司JDI、LG Display以及夏普等厂商都被迫减少供货，6代LTPS面板产能利用率也因此而下调约20%，影响整个手机面板市场。
As a result, on March 13, there were rumors that Apple would scale back its iPhone 11 panel orders, leading directly to cuts in supply from its suppliers, JDI, LG Display and Sharp, and a reduction of about 20% in the 6-generation LTPS panel capacity utilisation rate, affecting the entire handset panel market.
iPhone在供需两端受到负面影响已经成为不争的事实，只是具体数字还有待商榷。
The negative impact of the iPhone on both sides of supply and demand has become an indisputable fact, though the exact number is debatable.
重要的是，这种影响还在持续。
Importantly, the impact continues.
缺席5G早班车，错过平板红利苹果危局持续一系列的不确定因素，打乱了苹果新品发布的计划。
The absence of the 5G early bus, missing the tablet dividend Apple continued a series of uncertainties, scrambled Apple's new product release plan.
一方面，一年一度的苹果全球开发者大会（WWDC）在今年6月改为线上举行，30年来还属首次。
For the first time in 30 years, the annual Apple Global Developers' Conference (WWDC) was held online in June.
另一方面，原定于今年3月的春季产品发布会被推迟。
On the other hand, the spring product launch scheduled for March was postponed.
苹果2020财年一季报显示，苹果各产品线表现中，最大的惊喜来自手机业务；Mac和iPad的表现暗淡许多，Mac的营收为71.60亿美元，同比下跌3.45%，iPad营收59.77亿美元，同比下跌超11%。
Apple's 2020 quarterly results showed that the biggest surprise among Apple's product lines came from the cellphone business; the Mac and iPad fared much less, with Macs closing $7.16 billion, down 3.45% from a year earlier, and iPad revenue at $5.977 billion, down more than 11% from a year earlier.
苹果2020财年一季报各产品线销售占比而苹果18日晚低调上新的名单中，包括iPad pro、Mac mini、MacBook Air，唯独没有手机。
Apple reports its share of product line sales in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 and Apple's new low-key list of iPad pro, Mac Mini and MacBook Air, with the exception of cellphones.
有消息称，原因是春季发布会的主咖iPhone SE 2，也就是iPhone 9，还没有准备好面市。
The reason, according to one source, is that the main iPhone SE 2, or iPhone 9, of the spring launch is not ready for launch.
苹果供应链专家埃利奥特·兰预计，受疫情影响，iPhone SE 2的发布时间或将推迟数月。
Apple supply chain expert Elliot Rand expects the release of the iPhone SE 2 to be delayed for months because of the epidemic.
不过据台媒报道，iPhone SE 2已经进入生产验证阶段，最新消息是，新款苹果iPhone SE 2已结束量产验证并正式进入规模量产阶段。
But the iPhone SE 2 has moved into production validation, according to the Taiwanese press, and the latest update is that the new Apple iPhone SE 2 has gone through mass production validation and has officially entered a mass production phase.
然而，iPhone SE 2并不支持5G网络，苹果的iPhone12 5G原定于今秋推出，但受制于供应链产能恢复情况，还有跳票的可能。
However, the iPhone SE 2 does not support the 5G network, and Apple's iPhone 12-5G was due to be launched this fall, but is subject to supply chain capacity recovery and the possibility of ticket jumping.
艾维斯认为，如果苹果供应链的产能于4月底或5月初恢复，5G版iPhone的秋季发布会“最多被推迟几周”；若等到5月下旬或6月，将导致新款iPhone的发布时间被推迟至少3个月。
If Apple's supply-chain capacity were to resume in late April or early May, Mr. Elvis said the fall release of the 5G iPhone 'would be delayed by at most a few weeks'; waiting until late May or June would delay the release of the new iPhone for at least three months.
iPhone一直是苹果的拳头产品，在近几个财年贡献了苹果过半的营收，但基于过去几年在中国的市场份额已经受到挤压，如今5G手机发布时间点一延再延，即便苹果以最快速度恢复状态，推出5G手机，在目前主流智能手机厂商中也是最后一名。
The iPhone has long been Apple's biggest revenue earner, accounting for more than half of Apple's revenue in recent fiscal years, but given the squeeze on its market share in China over the past few years, the release of 5G phones has been delayed, even as Apple has recovered at the fastest rate, ending up last among mainstream smartphone makers.
对于从去年下半年就开始接受5G手机轰炸的国内消费者而言，它迟到了太久，正如几年前4G普及的晚一步入场，苹果在这个全新市场的份额也正在被中国厂商蚕食。
For domestic consumers, who have been bombarded with 5G phones since the second half of last year, Apple's share of the brand-new market is being eroded by Chinese producers, as was the late arrival of 4G a few years ago.
更有媒体悲观地判断，这款手机很有可能被苹果顺延到2021年发布。
More pessimistic media judgment, the mobile phone is likely to be pushed forward by Apple to 2021 release.
如今利空消息之下，苹果也失去了被资本市场看好的一部分重要原因。
Today, Apple is losing some of the key reasons why capital markets are bullish.
两周前，艾维斯还表示对苹果的5G手机充满期待，认为换机会带来一个“超级周期”，此消息一出，3月18日就以“新品没有5G手机”为由，下调了苹果公司股票目标价至335美元。
Two weeks ago, Elvis also said he was looking forward to Apple's 5G handset, saying it would bring a "super cycle" in exchange for an opportunity. On March 18, it lowered its target price to $335 for a new product without 5G phones.
据外媒3月11日报道，美银美林分析师Wamsi Mohan在给客户的报告中，也因为苹果新品（主要是iPhone SE 2和iPhone12 5G）的延期上市，将苹果股票的目标价格从350美元下调至320美元。
Wamsi Mohan, an analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, also lowered his target price for Apple shares from $350 to $320 in a report to clients and a delay in the launch of new Apple products, mainly the iPhone SE 2 and iPhone 12. 5G.
除了iPhone，艾维斯判断，苹果Mac、iPad、AirPods、服务业务及其他营收都会下滑。
In addition to the iPhone, Elvis reckons Apple's Mac, iPad, AirPods, service businesses and other revenue will all fall.
苹果这次的新品名单中的iPad Pro，除了市场反应的“贵”以外，也被认为是抓住了当下学生上网课的红利，但是，供货成为新问题。
Apple's new list of iPad Pro, in addition to the "expensive" market reaction, is seen as capturing the dividends of students' online classes now, but supply is a new problem.
上述苹果零售店的销售人员告诉燃财经，iPhone销售情况一般，但iPad系列异常抢手，门店不定时少量补货，部分型号的平板也已经断货。
Sales at the Apple store told Flaming Finance that iPhone sales were mediocre, but the iPad line was in great demand, with stores restocking infrequently and some of the tablet models being out of stock.
以iPad Air为例，苹果中国官网显示，在线预订需要等待3-4周才可发货。
In the case of iPad Air, Apple's China website says online bookings can take three to four weeks to deliver.
京东平台绝大部分iPad显示无货。
Most iPads on the Jingdong platform are not available.
来源 / 苹果官网来源 / 京东平台此次时隔近两年后更新的iPad Pro，在苹果中国官网规定每人每种尺寸限购2台。
www.iPad Pro, updated nearly two years later, sets a limit of two units per person per size on Apple's official website.
多年前，苹果曾经为了应对黄牛囤货，针对iPad规定过限购，但2011年之后就取消了这一限制。
Apple used to limit iPad purchases in response to hoarding years ago, but has lifted the restriction since 2011.
一增一减下，多个型号平板电脑供应不足，暴露了供应链的恢复情况。
One increase and one decrease, several models of tablet computers are in short supply, exposing the supply chain recovery.
而如果苹果眼前供应链的压力继续恶化，也将错失被“全民网课”带火的平板电脑需求，把疫情教育好了的市场留给对手。
And if the pressure on Apple's immediate supply chain continues to worsen, it will miss out on the demand for tablets, which are now popular with Universal Networking classes, leaving the market well-educated about the epidemic to rivals.
重重因素增加了资本市场对苹果的悲观预判。
A number of factors have added to the pessimistic outlook for Apple in capital markets.
瑞银集团（UBS）在一份报告中警告称，苹果产品需求低迷将影响至6月份，于是，下调了苹果截至6月底第三财季的iPhone销量预期（从4000万部下调至3800万部）和截至2020年9月的财年利润和营收预期。
In a report, UBS warned that weak demand for Apple's products would affect the company through June, and cut its iPhone sales forecast for the third quarter through June (38 million units from 40 million) and profit and revenue projections for the fiscal year ending September 2020.
艾维斯也在自己的报告中下调了2020财年（截至今年9月份）和2021财年iPhone的出货量、销售额及苹果整体的营收。
In his report, Mr. Elvis also slashed iPhone shipments, sales and overall revenue for fiscal years 2020 (through September) and 2021.
对于2020财年，艾维斯预计iPhone出货1.72亿部，较之前预计的2亿部有明显下滑，营收由之前的1520亿美元下调到了1310亿美元，苹果整体的营收则由2850亿美元下调到了2510亿美元。
For fiscal year 2020, Mr. Elvis expects the iPhone to ship 172 million units, down sharply from an earlier estimate of 200 million, revenue to $131 billion from $152 billion, and overall revenue to $251 billion from $285 billion.
至于2021财年，iPhone预计出货1.9亿部，营收1470亿美元，全球的营收最新预计为2820亿美元，低于之前预计的3090亿美元。
For fiscal year 2021, the iPhone is expected to ship 190 million units with revenue of $147 billion, and global revenue is now estimated at $282 billion, down from $309 billion previously forecast.
苹果眼下的危局，恐怕将持续到下一个年头。
Apple's current crisis is likely to continue into the next year.
