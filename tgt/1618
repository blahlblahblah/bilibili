“他是一个英雄”2月18日上午10点54分，武昌医院院长刘智明因感染新冠肺炎，经抢救无效去世，享年51岁。
"He is a hero" Feb. 18, 10: 54 a.m., Wuchang hospital director Liu Zhiming died of pneumonia, after rescue, at the age of 51.
“刘院长是一个很负责的人，内心非常强，我们医院的同事都很敬重他。
"Dean Liu is a very responsible person, very strong heart, our colleagues in the hospital are very respected him.
他长得高高大大的，很有才气，结果说没就没了，心里觉得很不是滋味。
He was tall and talented, and the result was that he didn't have it, and he felt very uncomfortable.
”武昌医院肾内科医生邱江平对《中国新闻周刊》说。
Qiu Jiangping, a nephrologist at Wuchang Hospital, told China News Weekly.
目前，武昌医院的医护人员感染严重，涉及多个科室和部门，包括主任和护士长。
At present, the hospital staff in Wuchang is seriously infected, involving many departments and departments, including the director and head nurse.
同时，这家医院也面临着物资紧缺的情况，仍在向外界求助。
Meanwhile, the hospital is facing a shortage of supplies and is still turning to the outside world for help.
武昌医院对接捐赠事务的负责人告诉《中国新闻周刊》，目前的防护服等物资只能坚持3～5天。
The director of Wuchang Hospital told China News Weekly that current supplies such as protective clothing can only last three to five days.
改造之难1月21日，武昌医院接到通知，成为武汉市首批发热门诊定点医院之一。
On January 21, Wuchang Hospital was notified that it was one of the first hospitals in Wuhan to be designated as a fever clinic.
这天下午5点，刘智明给老同事金捷打电话，告知了这一消息。
At 5pm that day, Liu Zhiming telephoned his old colleague Jin Jie and informed him of the news.
如何对医院进行改造成为了最紧要的任务，工期太短，只有两天的时间用来腾空和改造。
How to renovate the hospital has become the most urgent task, the construction period is too short, only two days to vacate and transform.
这是两人最后一次交流，刘智明没有提及自己的身体情况。
It was the last time the two talked, and Liu made no mention of his health.
金捷是武汉市第三人民医院前任院长。
Jin Jie is the former director of Wuhan Third People's Hospital.
担任武昌医院院长之前，刘智明和金捷在武汉市第三人民医院共事多年，金捷对刘智明的印象是有热情，能力强，担任院长后，将武昌医院从二甲变成了三级乙等医院。
Before becoming the director of Wuchang Hospital, Liu Zhiming and Jin Jie had worked together for many years in Wuhan Third People's Hospital.
但对于这次改造，金捷也有些不确定，时间太短，更何况，当时武昌医院里还有800多名患者。
But for this transformation, JinJie also some uncertainty, too short a time, not to mention, Wuchang Hospital at that time there are more than 800 patients.
1月22日凌晨4点，刘智明还在工作，他给妻子蔡利萍打了电话，说是医院完成改造之后，就无法回家了。
On January 22, at 4 a.m., Liu Zhiming was still at work. He telephoned his wife, Cai Liping, saying that after the hospital had been renovated, he could not go home.
妻子有些着急，问丈夫为什么这么晚还不休息。
The wife was in a hurry and asked her husband why he had stayed up so late.
第二天下午，妻子却收到了丈夫感染肺炎并住院的消息。
The next afternoon, however, the wife received news that her husband had contracted pneumonia and was hospitalized.
据妻子蔡利萍回忆，丈夫早在1月中旬，就已经持续低烧一周。
As early as mid-January, her husband had been running low for a week, according to her wife, Cai Liping.
在病区改造过程中，邱江平听说刘院长住院了，各种场合也不见了院长的身影。
In the course of the transformation of the disease area, Qiu Jianping heard that President Liu had been hospitalized and that the dean had disappeared on various occasions.
当时工期紧张，只有一天的时间，几乎不可能完成，还要处理衔接不畅的问题。
It was a tight schedule, with only one day to complete, and had to deal with the problem of poor connectivity.
邱江平深知病房改造的必要。
Qiu Jianping understands the necessity of ward reform.
转为定点医院之前，武昌医院的物资和设备紧缺，没有专门的员工通道，不具备处理传染病的条件。
Before the transfer to the designated hospital, Wuchang Hospital was short of materials and equipment, there was no dedicated staff access, and there were no conditions for dealing with infectious diseases.
“我们在发热门诊的时候，楼道的里里外外挤满了前来看病的人，我们就在诊室里面穿防护服，穿完直接就看病人，防护服一脱掉，还要从病人人群里走出来。
"When we were at the fever clinic and the aisles were crowded with people coming in and out, we were wearing protective clothing in the office and seeing the patients right after wearing them, taking off the protective clothing and getting out of the crowd.
”邱江平对《中国新闻周刊》说。
Qiu Jianping told China News Weekly.
邱江平所在的肾内科原本有60多位做血液透析的病人，22日一天之内全部转院。
Qiu Jianping's Department of Renal Medicine originally had more than 60 hemodialysis patients, 22 days all transferred to the hospital.
据他介绍，这些病人先是转去了天佑医院，但在1月29日，天佑医院也成为了第三批定点医院，这些血透病人只好再次转院。
He said the patients had been transferred to God-You Hospital, but on January 29, they had become the third batch of designated hospitals and the dialysis patients had to be transferred back to hospital.
1月24日，大年三十，武昌医院开始接收新冠肺炎患者。
January 24, about 30, Wuchang Hospital began to receive patients with new crown pneumonia.
那天夜里，护士徐闻值班，当时就感觉病人太多了，一下子都涌进来。
That night, the nurse Xu Wen on duty, then feel the patient too much, all of a sudden rush in.
她不太熟悉病区改造之后的格局，找了很久才找到医护人员的通道，经过的时候，看到过道里在熏艾草。
She is not familiar with the disease area after the transformation of the pattern, looking for a long time to find the passage of medical staff, passing, see the passage in the smoked wormwood.
多位接受采访的护士表达了对于清洁区的忧虑。
A number of nurses interviewed expressed concern about the cleanup area.
医院条件有限，病区位于一楼和二楼，楼道之间的走廊是通风的。
Hospital conditions are limited and the area is located on the first and second floors. The corridor between the aisles is ventilated.
三楼的一半区域是医护人员休息和穿脱防护装备的地方，而另一半也是患者住院的病房，中间隔着通道，宽两米左右。
Half of the area on the third floor was for rest and protective equipment for medical staff, while the other half was the patient's in-patient ward, spaced between two metres wide.
每次去清洁区，都要经过这条通道，隔板上有窗户，是打开的。
Every time I go to the cleaning area, I pass through this passageway. There are windows on the partitions. They are open.
与此同时，刘智明的病情进一步恶化。
Meanwhile, Liu's condition worsened.
妻子蔡利萍是武汉市第三医院光谷院区重症病区（ICU）护士长，同样在忙着收治肺炎病人，曾在工作间隙看过他。
His wife, Cai Liping, is the head nurse of Guanggu Campus (ICU), the third hospital in Wuhan, who is also busy treating patients with pneumonia and who has seen him between work.
更多的时候，她从丈夫的主诊医师那里得知丈夫的病情，氧饱和一度低于80，怎么都上不去。
More often than not, she learned from her husband's attending physician that her husband's condition was such that oxygen saturation of less than 80 degrees prevented her from going.
院内感染加剧2月2日开始，邱江平和同事开始收治感染新冠肺炎的血透病人，当时，这部分特殊群体的需求已经显露出来。
Hospital infections intensified February 2, Qiu Jiang Ping and colleagues began to treat patients infected with the new crown pneumonia, when the needs of this special group have been revealed.
但人手仍然不够，只有4名医生，10台血透机，需要照顾30名血透病人。
However, there is still a shortage of staff, with only 4 doctors, 10 hemodialysis machines and 30 hemodialysis patients.
与此同时，身边同事的感染情况在加重。
At the same time, infection levels among colleagues around them are increasing.
1月底，武昌医院曾安排医护人员进行统一的CT检查，邱江平所在的C2病区就有两名护士出现肺炎迹象，被安排隔离。
At the end of January, Wuchang Hospital arranged for a unified CT examination by medical staff, and two nurses in Qiu Jianping's C2 area showed signs of pneumonia and were placed in isolation.
一楼专门腾出了一片区域，住的都是本院患新冠肺炎的医护人员。

1月底，护士张婷刚刚调到住院部，开始负责新冠肺炎患者，在此之前，她在普外科工作。

CT结果出来之后，张婷听说ICU的几个护士感染了。
CT results came out, Zhang Ting heard that several ICU nurses infected.
她对工作环境有些担忧，而且人手短缺，不够轮班，一直是高强度工作。
She was worried about the working environment and was understaffed and short of shift work, which had been intense.
此外，物资也很紧张，值完夜班的第二天早上，张婷被告知，只剩下泡面可以吃了。
In addition, supplies are also very tight, after the night of the next morning, Zhang Ting was told that only bubble noodles can be eaten.
她跟护士长反映情况，但并没有什么办法。
She spoke to the head nurse, but there was nothing she could do.
陆续有更多的同事脱下了防护服，变成了病房里的患者。
More and more colleagues took off their protective clothing and became patients in the wards.
药剂科主任感染了肺炎，病情严重。
Pharmacy director infected with pneumonia, serious illness.
儿科护士长和4名护士同样感染了病毒。
Paediatric head nurses and four nurses were also infected with the virus.
除此之外，平时跟病人接触很少的部门，比如人事科，感染情况也很严重，这让张婷和其他护士觉得很费解。
On top of that, departments with little contact with patients, such as the personnel department, also had serious infections, which made it difficult for Zhang Ting and other nurses to understand.
2月6日早7点，59岁的护士柳帆感觉身体不适，有发热症状，给科室护士长打了电话。

武昌医院重症监护室的主任告诉他，刘院长的病情很严重，1月19日出现症状。
The director of the intensive care unit at Wuchang Hospital told him that Liu was very ill and had symptoms on January 19.
2月14日，刘智明从武昌医院重症监护室转移到同济医院中法院区，进行氧气插管。
