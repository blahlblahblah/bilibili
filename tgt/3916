深度和角度——这就是我们能做的。
Depth and angle - that's what we can do.

无论是港警、医生、护士、议员，疫情面前我们都只是普通人，都有机会被感染。
Whether it be harbour police, doctors, nurses, parliamentarians, we are all ordinary people, we all have the opportunity to be infected.
如果说反修例事件让我们在香港得这些爱国爱港人士紧密联系在一起，那么新冠肺炎疫情让我们认识到作为中国人有多幸福。
If the case of anti-revisionism has brought us closer together in Hong Kong by these patriotic and loving people, then the SARS epidemic has made us realize how happy we are as Chinese people.
记　者| 周 洁受访人| 虚胖的奶爸看着一封封医院确认收货的感谢函沿着网络传到我们的手机里，看着内地的疫情一步步得到控制，我们的心情最近也变好了。
AT & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45
部分医院开具的感谢信因为此前香港的一些风波，我和我身边的朋友自发组成了一个爱国爱港团体，我们中有律师、公务员、媒体人，也有销售、商人、主妇，还有过去大半年里备受瞩目的香港警察，我们这些人的共同点：既爱国，也爱港。
Thanks to the troubles in Hong Kong, my friends and I have spontaneously formed a patriotic support group. We include lawyers, civil servants, media people, sales people, businessmen, housewives, and the Hong Kong police who have been in the spotlight for most of the past year.
最大的心愿，就是国家繁荣，香港安定，我们能够安居乐业。
Our greatest wish is for a prosperous and stable Hong Kong where we can live and work in peace and contentment.
捐钱捐物，为内地抗疫出一份力疫情发生后，我们身边很多人都想为内地做些事。
Donate money and goods to fight a pandemic in the Mainland, many people around us want to do something for the Mainland.
我们从新闻上了解到，内地的口罩供应非常紧缺，于是我们打算在海外采买一些口罩寄给需要的地方。
We learned from the news that the supply of masks on the mainland is in short supply, so we plan to buy some masks overseas and send them to places where they are needed.
恰好我们有小伙伴，因为职业的关系，跟湖北的一些医疗机构认识，能够直接寄到武汉。
Just as we have a small partner, because of the professional relationship, and Hubei some medical institutions know, can be sent directly to Wuhan.
令我们没有想到的是，口罩的采买还是挺波折的。
What we didn't think of was that the purchase of masks was quite erratic.
比如我们在韩国的口罩采买，因为缺货、涨价等关系，买到的口罩数量不太多，甚至还有商家把收到的款项退给我们。
For example, we buy face masks in South Korea, because of the shortage of goods, price increases, and so on, buy a small number of masks, and even businesses to the money received back to us.
原先，我们委托了商家帮我直接快递到武汉，也曾委托一些旅游中介机构帮忙运输，但都没有谈成。
Originally, we entrusted the merchant to help me express directly to Wuhan, also commissioned some travel agencies to help transport, but did not negotiate.
后来疫情发展，韩国限制了医疗物资的出口——对于口罩类产品，一个快递不能超过300只，种种因素下，我们的一个小伙伴亲自飞到韩国分装打包，把几千只口罩分成了六七个快递邮寄，虽然工作量变大了，邮费也高了很多，但能帮到同胞，我们还是挺开心的。
As the epidemic unfolded, South Korea restricted the export of medical supplies - not more than 300 for a single delivery - and one of our small partners flew to South Korea to pack and deliver thousands of masks by courier six or seven times, but we were happy to be able to help our compatriots.
之所以不从香港直接买口罩邮寄，是因为当时香港的快递已经停运，只有邮政才能寄到内地，但邮政的寄送需要具体收件人的身份证信息，对于我们不太方便，所以没有采用。
The reason for not buying masks directly from Hong Kong was that couriers in Hong Kong were no longer in service and could only be sent by post to the Mainland. However, it was not convenient for us to send them by mail.
“儿歌三百首”是该团体的名字后来，我们联系到仙桃一家生产防护服的工厂，这个厂家有两条生产线，一条用来出口，一条是生产国标的防护服，国标的防护服已经被国家征用了，我们买不到，出口的防护服虽然没有达到医疗用的标准，但我们考虑到在当时疫情大暴发的情况下，防护服是很紧缺的，即便一线用不上，二线也可以用。
Later, we contacted a factory producing protective clothing in Xiantao, which has two production lines, one for export and one for protective clothing of producer countries. The national standard protective clothing has been requisitioned by the state and we cannot buy it.
于是，我们拿着厂家给我们的防护服相关资料，发动群里的小伙伴联系仙桃周围地市的医院，如果他们确定可以接收，那我们就把防护服想办法运过去。
So, we took the manufacturer's protective clothing to us, launched the group of small partners to contact the city hospitals around the peach, if they sure can accept, we will try to transport the protective clothing.
其实，当时湖北的各地交通已经封锁了，车辆通行需要各种通行证，幸好我们通过朋友的关系辗转联系到了有运输资格的物流公司，不过运输的时间比平时要慢很多，比如我们运的一批从仙桃到天门的防护服，平时只要五六个小时，但这批货的运输却花了20多个小时，司机师傅往往只能在路边简单地解决一下吃饭，非常辛苦。
In fact, the traffic in Hubei was blocked, vehicles needed various permits, but fortunately we were able to contact the qualified logistics companies through friends, but the transport time was much slower than usual, such as our shipment of nectarine to Tianmen protective clothing, which took more than 20 hours to transport.
靠着这种办法，我们大概捐了3000多套防护服。
In this way, we have donated some 3,000 suits of protective clothing.
部分医院现场交接照片由于湖北封城政策越来越严格，防护服的物流最终中断了，厂家就把剩余的钱款返给了我们，商量了一下之后，我们决定用这笔钱采购护目镜。
As Hubei closed the city more and more strict policy, the logistics of protective clothing was finally interrupted, the manufacturer returned the remaining money to us, after a discussion, we decided to use the money to purchase goggles.
当时除了湖北，内地的其他省区市的也陆续有确诊病例出现，我们先后联系到了湖北、上海、广西、深圳、湖南等地需要护目镜的医院，进行了捐赠。
At that time, in addition to Hubei, other provinces and municipalities in the mainland have also been confirmed cases, we have successively contacted Hubei, Shanghai, Guangxi, Shenzhen, Hunan and other places in need of goggles, donated.
在这场爱心接力中，我只是一个协调人，我的背后，是一群爱国爱港的香港市民。
In this relay of love, I am just a coordinator, behind me, a group of patriotic Hong Kong people love Hong Kong.
他们中的很多人我并不认识，但大家有钱的出钱，有力的出力，三百五百的善款汇成涓涓细流，将一件件抗疫物资带去了需要他们的地方。
Many of them I do not know, but we have the money to help, powerful efforts, three hundred and fifty dollars into a trickle, to take every piece of anti-epidemic supplies to where they are needed.
其实，除了抗疫，我们这些人还有一个目的——最近这一年，内地和香港的冲突很多，两地民众的误解也很大，我们希望通过自己的行为，让内地看到，并不是所有香港人都没有对祖国的身份认同，我们是跟祖国血脉相依，命运相连的。
In fact, apart from fighting the disease, we people have another purpose - we have had a lot of conflicts in the Mainland and Hong Kong in recent years, and people in both places have misunderstood each other. By our actions, we hope to show the Mainland that not all Hong Kong people have no identity for the motherland.
撑警抗暴，期待繁荣香港再现其实，这不是我们这群人第一次聚在一起。
Police are fighting riot and looking forward to a prosperous Hong Kong. Actually, this is not the first time our group has gathered together.
过去几个月，香港围绕修例，社会变得不太稳定，香港的警察承受了很大的压力。
Over the past few months, the community has become unstable and the police in Hong Kong have come under a lot of pressure.
作为普通市民，表达对警察的支持，让他们觉得有人跟他们站在一起，变得非常重要，于是我们几个朋友组建了一个群来支持警察。
As ordinary citizens, it became very important to express their support for the police and make them feel that someone was standing with them, so several of our friends formed a group to support the police.
香港暴力事件最严重的时候，普通人可能会在遭遇暴徒时手机被抢走翻看。
At the height of the violence in Hong Kong, ordinary people may be robbed of their mobile phones when confronted by thugs.
如果你的微信群名里有“爱国爱港”之类的文字，可能会遭到暴徒的骚扰甚至报复，出于保护大家安全的考虑，我把群名改成了“儿歌三百首”——这是周星驰的一部电影，法师玄奘一直想用随身携带的《儿歌三百首》感化妖怪，一开始虽然他很羸弱，不堪一击，但日子久了，儿歌三百首重组，化为了一句句佛经，终于将妖怪降服。
To protect your security, I changed the group name to "Three Hundred Songs for Children" - a film by Chow Xingchi, and the wizard Xuanzang tried to influence the genie with his 300 Children's Songs.
Play去年10月，我们作为“儿歌三百首”热心市民团体，第一次为支持警察募捐了4万余元港币。
In October last year, as a group of 300 children's songs, we collected over HK $40,000 for the first time to support the police.
我们用这些钱分两次采买了一些食品饮料、能量棒、保健药品等等到几个工作量最大的警署进行慰问。
We used the money to buy food and drink, energy bars, health-care products and so on in two rounds to the most overworked police stations.
虽说我之前也跟其他爱港团体去过警署慰问，不过第一次自己主动联系去警署，还真有点不知道跟警察说什么，只好简单介绍了下自己的生活工作情况，表达了市民对警察的支持。
Although I have been to the police station with other love groups before, but the first time I contact the police, I really do not know what to say to the police, can only briefly introduce their own life and work, expressed the support of the citizens to the police.
不得不说，非常时期，进入警署还是需要勇气的。
It has to be said that it takes courage to get into a police station during bad times.
我记得送第一批货的时候，警署门口围了好多拿着摄像机单反的鬼鬼祟祟不明身份者，接收物资的警察跟我们说，原来，当天香港组织了一些示威活动，他们蹲在门口，是在等反对派来袭击警署......第二次买保健品的时候，药店老板看我们短期内大量购买了两次，还试探性地问我们是否是给警察做捐赠，他知道以后，在原价的基础上打了一些折扣卖给我们。
I remember when the first consignment was delivered, there were a lot of sneaky unidentified men at the door of the police station who said they were squatting in front of the door, waiting for the opposition to attack the police station.
他说，他也很想支持警察，但如果他透露这种立场，可能店都会被暴徒砸了，现在我们来做这件事，他也想出一份力。
He said he, too, wanted to support the police, but if he had revealed that position, the store would have been destroyed by the mob, and now we're going to do it, he said.
我们去湾仔警署的时候，大概每十几分钟就能看到一波来慰问的团体。
When we go to the Wanchai Police Station, we'll see groups of solicitors every ten minutes or so.
后来，我们觉得送吃的和保健品很多人都已经在做了，我们想送点更实用的。
Later, we felt that a lot of people were already doing food and health care. We wanted to send something more practical.
通过朋友，我们了解到，警察出勤时因为腰部配枪和其他一些装备，时间长了挺累的。
Through our friends, we learned that the police were tired when they were on duty because they had guns and other equipment around their waist.
市面上有一种护腰垫，放在腰部可以多一层保护，于是我们给旺角警署捐了800套。
There is a kind of waist pad on the waist to protect the more, so we donated 800 sets to Mong Kok Police Station.
此外，我们还买了一些便携式灭火器和其他防护装备。
In addition, we bought some portable fire extinguishers and other protective equipment.
理工大学要清场的那天，我们采购到了一批战术手套，能够防刀割——如果暴徒突然要拿匕首捅警察的话，戴了手套，警察可以抓住匕首。
On the day the Polytechnic University was due to wind up, we bought a bunch of tactical gloves that were knife-proof - if the mob suddenly tried to stab the police with a dagger and gloves, the police could grab the dagger.
我们第一时间把手套送去了尖沙咀警署，他们马上能够用得上，觉得自己做的事挺有意义的。
The first time we sent them to the Tsim Sha Tsui Police Station, they were ready to use it and felt they were doing something meaningful.
那段时间，还有很多暴徒晚上出来示威，我们就第一时间给警察采购了一种佩戴在帽子上的强光手电筒，这些不是标准装备，如果等警务处走流程，不知道要等到猴年马月。
At that time, there were also a lot of rioters out at night, and we first purchased a kind of bright flashlight for the police to wear on a hat. These were not standard equipment.
找到具体型号后，我们打算采购2800只左右，不过香港的供货商报价太高。
When we find the exact model, we intend to purchase about 2,800 units, but Hong Kong suppliers are offering too high a price.
后来，我们跟深圳的厂家联系，他知道我们的目的后，给了我们非常优惠的价格，还送了我们一些配件，最终我们顺利地把这批物资给到了香港的警署。
Later, we contacted the factory in Shenzhen, he knew our purpose, gave us a very good price, and sent us some accessories, and finally we successfully delivered the goods to the police station in Hong Kong.
只要是对警察有用的，我们都会想办法买给警察。
As long as it's useful to the police, we'll try to buy it for the police.
截至目前，我曾经先后组织过30多场的撑警活动，估计有1200多人参与了我们的物资众筹活动，近百人到过现场送物资。
So far, I have organized more than 30 police support activities, estimated that more than 1200 people participated in our mass fundraising activities, nearly 100 people to the scene to deliver goods.
最近，香港的疫情状况也不容乐观。
The recent epidemic in Hong Kong is no laughing matter.
我们了解到有警察被确诊了，我们给家属送了一些口罩和消毒用品，虽然价值不大，但我觉得这是一种鼓励，一点心意。
We learned that the police had been diagnosed and that we had given the family some masks and disinfectant supplies, which were of little value, but I thought it was a kind of encouragement and a little something.
我书念得不多，说不出什么大道理。
I can't say much when I read too much.
但我很感谢这段时间周围人对我们的信任，也感动于我们的凝聚力。
But I am grateful for the trust placed in us by those around us during this time and for our cohesion.
我想，这是因为我们都热爱香港这片土地，我们热爱这个国家，我们都是中国人，我们不愿意看到香港整个社会撕裂。
I think it's because we all love Hong Kong, we love this country, we are all Chinese, and we don't want to see the whole of Hong Kong torn apart.
过去发生的那些暴力事件，不应该被无良媒体美化，错的就是错的。
The violent events of the past should not be glorified by unscrupulous media. What is wrong is wrong.
香港警察作为维护社会秩序的最后一道防线，我们希望给他们切切实实的支持，做些力所能及的事情。
The Hong Kong Police, as the last line of defence in maintaining public order, hope to give them practical support and do what they can.
这两件事突然让我们回归到了家国情怀，并且付诸行动。
These two events suddenly brought us back to home feeling and put it into action.
无论是港警、医生、护士、议员，疫情面前我们都只是普通人，都有机会被感染。
Whether it be harbour police, doctors, nurses, parliamentarians, we are all ordinary people, we all have the opportunity to be infected.
如果说反修例事件让我们在香港的这些爱国爱港人士紧密联系在一起，那么新冠肺炎疫情让我们认识到作为中国人有多幸福。
If the case of anti-revisionism binds our patriotic and Hong Kong people together in Hong Kong, then the SARS epidemic has made us realize how happy we are as Chinese people.
雨过天晴后，我们希望繁荣稳定的香港早日重现，还我们一个安居乐业的社会。
After a rainy day, we hope to see an early return of a prosperous and stable Hong Kong and a peaceful society.
