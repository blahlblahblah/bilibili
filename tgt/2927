本报记者 郭阳琛 刘媛媛 上海报道一边花式促销以求销售回款，一边寻求多渠道融资“输血”。
Liu Yuanyuan, a reporter in Shanghai, reported that Liu Yuanyuan sought multi-channel funding for her transfusion while promoting sales of cash.
新冠肺炎疫情影响之下，房企打响了现金流“保卫战”，回笼资金成了当下的重中之重。
Under the impact of the new crown pneumonia, housing enterprises hit cash flow "defense war," the return of funds has become the top priority.
据亿翰智库针对67家大中小房企的调研结果，企业目前面临的困境主要有售楼处关闭，销售回款大幅下降，虽进行线上销售，但效果一般；资金成本、人力成本和税金等刚性支出照旧，企业资金压力大；2020年上半年到期债务体量大等。
According to a survey of 67 large, medium-sized and medium-sized housing enterprises, the main difficulties faced by enterprises are the closure of sales offices, a sharp decline in sales refunds, sales on-line, but only moderately effective; rigid expenditures such as capital costs, labour costs and taxes, and high levels of debt maturing in the first half of 2020.
《中国经营报》记者注意到，2月初，各大房企更青睐于海外融资渠道，且因疫情蔓延发债量锐减。
At the beginning of February, China Business reported, major housing companies preferred overseas financing and saw debt issuance plummet as the epidemic spread.
随着央行频频向市场投入流动性，房企开始将目光转向国内，发债频率明显加快，发行利率也开始走低。
As central banks pumped liquidity into the market, housing companies began to look inward, issuing debt at a much faster pace and issuing rates began to fall.
同时，各地政府也纷纷出台涉房政策，为房企“减负”。
At the same time, governments around the country have also introduced housing-related policies, for housing enterprises to "reduce the burden."
针对当前环境下房地产资金问题，记者先后采访了旭辉控股集团有限公司（00884.HK）、融信中国控股有限公司（03301.HK）、金融街控股股份有限公司（000402.SZ）等企业。
In view of the current environment of real estate capital issues, the reporter interviewed a number of companies such as Xuhui Holding Group Limited (00884.HK), Rongxin China Holdings Limited (03301.HK), Financial Street Holdings Co. Ltd. (000402.SZ).
旭辉集团方面回复称，2019年全年，公司回款率超90%，相关融资安排足以覆盖年内到期的债务；融信中国方面表示，公司近期虽没有新的融资计划，但通过再融资增加了长期限的债务，抗风险能力增强；金融街相关负责人则表示，公司各项经营指标在好转，尤其是现金流方面得到了较大的改善，经营现金流已经转正。
The company responded that it had a 90 per cent recovery rate for all of 2019 and that the financing arrangements were sufficient to cover debt maturing during the year. Credit China said it had recently increased its risk resistance by refinancing long-term debt without a new financing plan, while the financier said the company's business indicators were improving, especially in terms of cash flow, and operating cash flow had turned positive.
销售、偿债承压受疫情影响，工地施工被搁浅，线下售楼处难以复工，尽管纷纷转战线上花式促销，但房企仍感受到线上成交难度大造成的资金回流难。
Sales, debt-servicing pressure affected by the epidemic, the construction site was stranded, the offline sales office difficult to resume work, although the front line in a variety of fancy sales, but still feel the difficulty of online transactions caused by the return of funds.
亿翰智库调查报告显示，67%的房企以线上渠道对冲线下售楼处关闭的影响，但其中70%房企认为销售成效不好，30%的房企认为销售成效一般。
About 67 percent of companies hedged offline against the closure of off-line sales, but 70 percent of them said sales were ineffective and 30 percent said sales were mediocre, according to the report.
销售数据也印证了企业的预感。
Sales data also confirm the company's premonition.
克而瑞数据显示，2月，楼市成交下行，27个重点城市整体成交240万平方米，环比降幅高达83%，同比仍跌77%，显著不及2019年月均；百强房企销售同比下滑38%，销售好于预期。
In February, 27 key cities closed 2.4 million sq m, down 83% year-on-year, well below the monthly average of 2019, while sales of the top 100 housing companies fell 38% year-on-year, better than expected.
其中，约9成的房企单月同、环比均下跌，重点上市房企中，过半企业的2月销售同比跌幅超过50%，部分企业超过70%。
Among them, about 90% of the housing enterprises in a single month, ring-to-ring all fell, key listed housing enterprises, more than half of the year-on-year sales of more than 50% in February, some enterprises more than 70%.
另一方面，由于2019年融资监管不断加码，融资规模未能保持住2018年的增长势头，业内也担忧是否能顺利偿还即将到期的债务。
On the other hand, financing has failed to sustain the 2018 growth momentum, owing to rising financing regulations in 2019, and there are concerns in the industry about the smooth servicing of maturing debt.
据克而瑞不完全统计，3月房企到期债券总量达到330亿元以上，将面临一个新的偿债小高峰。
According to Krugby incomplete statistics, the total number of maturities in March reached more than 33 billion yuan, will face a new small debt servicing peak.
亿翰智库研报分析称，2019年房企信用债发行总额5909.1亿元，而2020年将到期的信用债总额为7468.6亿元，2020年全年融资规模增速达到26.4%，才能刚好覆盖到期的债务。
According to an analysis by the Yum Ho Think Tank Research Report, in 2019, 59.91 billion yuan of housing credit bonds were issued, compared with 746.86 billion yuan in 2020, with full-year financing increasing by 26.4% in 2020 to cover just maturing debt.
过去，不少房企通过高周转与高息融资成功获得快速扩张。
In the past, many housing companies through high turnover and high-interest financing has been successful in rapid expansion.
例如，近期集齐一批明星高管成为业内关注焦点的弘阳地产。
Recently, for example, a group of star executives became the focus of attention in the industry Hongyang real estate.
为冲击销售规模，弘阳地产走上了高周转之路。
In order to impact the scale of sales, Hongyang real estate has embarked on a high turnover.
早在上市之时，弘阳地产就在招股书中坦言，要求各城市开发团队在获取土地后85天内实现开工，180天内实现有质量的开盘。
As early as the time of listing, Hongyang real estate in the prospectus confessed that the city development teams are required to land within 85 days after the start of construction, 180 days to achieve a quality of the opening.
为了支撑其冲击千亿的野心，弘阳地产频繁高息融资。
In order to support its trillion-dollar ambitions, Hongyang real estate frequent high-interest financing.
1月14日，弘阳地产公告将发行2023年到期的3亿美元优先票据，利率为9.70%，这已经是上市不到两年的时间里第10次发有息债。
On January 14, Hongyang Land announced it would issue $300 million in preferred paper maturing in 2023, at an interest rate of 9.70%, the 10th interest-bearing debt to be issued in less than two years.
近期，金融街频发短债，累计融资金额近50亿元。
Recently, the financial street frequent short-term debt, accumulated financing of nearly 5 billion yuan.
3月2日，据上清所披露，金融街拟发行2020年度第二期超短期融资券，发行金额19亿元，期限为267天。
On March 2, it was revealed that the second issue of ultra-short-term securities in 2020 would be issued in the financial district for a period of 267 days, with an issue of $1.9 billion.
1月，公司发行了2020年度第一期超短期融资券，发行金额29亿元，期限为10个月，发行利率为2.98%。
In January, the company issued its first issue of ultra-short-term securities for the year 2020, with a 10-month maturity of 2.9 billion yuan and an issue rate of 2.98 per cent.
实际上，老牌房企金融街一度饱受资金压力。
In fact, the old housing finance street once suffered from funding pressure.
相关数据显示，2017～2018年，金融街控股连续两年经营活动产生的现金流量净额为负值，分别为-72.54亿元和-90.29亿元。
Between 2017 and 2018, the net cash flows from the two consecutive years of operations of the Financial Street Holdings were negative, at -7.254 billion yuan and -9.029 billion yuan, respectively.
据三季报，报告期内，公司筹资活动产生的现金流量净额为-78.2 亿元，上年同期为 141.6 亿元。
During the reporting period, net cash flow from corporate fund-raising activities was -7.82 billion yuan, compared with 14.16 billion yuan in the same period of the previous year, according to the quarterly report.
金融街方面表示，筹资活动现金流变化的主要原因是公司新增债务融资较上年同期减少，偿还到期债务较上年同期增加。
Financial Street said the main reason for the change in cash flow from fundraising activities was a decrease in new debt financing from a year earlier and an increase in payments on maturing debt from a year earlier.
此外，金融街于2015年上海火车站北广场项目贵为当年上海总价地王，却开发周期漫长。
In addition, in 2015 Shanghai Railway Station North Square Project for the Shanghai total price King, but the development cycle is long.
据介绍，住宅部分已于去年上半年清盘，但因限价价格稍低于预期；商办部分在2017年签下了一笔40多亿元的“大单”，以定制产品的方式将部分写字楼出售给香港一家投资公司。
The residential property was liquidated in the first half of last year but prices were slightly lower than expected, according to the department, which in 2017 signed a "big order" of more than $4 billion to sell some of its offices to a Hong Kong investment company through custom-made products.
而剩余的商办部分将打造成商业综合体，预计今年底完工50%。
The remainder will form a commercial complex, expected to be completed by 50 per cent by the end of this year.
金融街相关负责人告诉记者，目前公司现金流得到了较大改善，将在3月底发布的2019年财报中体现，“上海地王项目土地成本一共88亿元，还有10亿元未收回，这个项目对公司目前现金流不会产生压力”。
Financial Street officials told reporters that the company's cash flow has improved significantly, will be released at the end of March 2019 reported that "the total land cost of the King of Shanghai project 8.8 billion yuan, with 1 billion yuan not recovered, this project will not put pressure on the company's current cash flow."
频频发债补血销售端遇阻，房企纷纷转向融资端谋求“输血”。
Frequent debt to replenish the sales of blood blocked, housing enterprises have turned to financing for "blood transfusion."
但事与愿违的是，疫情暴发前期，融资规模也明显收缩。
But, contrary to expectations, financing contracted sharply in the early stages of the outbreak.
据亿翰智库数据，在春节前后时间段，2月中旬的信用债融资规模同比下降45.6%，彼时房企更青睐于海外发债尤其是美元债。
Credit-debt financing fell 45.6% year-on-year in the mid-February period before and after the Spring Festival, when homeowners preferred to sell debt, especially in dollars.
此后，好在央行频频向市场投入流动性。
Since then, the central bank has frequently pumped liquidity into the market.
2月3日、4日，中国人民银行连续两天累计投放1.7万亿元流动性，2月11日再次通过逆回购投放1000亿元。
On February 3 and 4, the People's Bank of China injected 1.7 trillion yuan of liquidity for two consecutive days, and on February 11, the People's Bank of China released another 100 billion yuan in reverse repurchase.
这使得包括房企在内的各行各业看到了扩“融”的希望。
This makes all walks of life, including housing enterprises, see the hope of "financial" expansion.
记者梳理发现，相比于2月初，近期房企发债频率明显加快，发行利率也大幅降低，不少利率已跌破3.5%。
Correspondent carding found that compared to the beginning of February, the frequency of debt issuance by housing enterprises has been noticeably faster, the issue rate has also been significantly reduced, many interest rates have fallen below 3.5%.
相关数据也显示，境内债方面，2月在短融中票的带动下，发债规模363亿元，同比上涨50%，终结“5连降”。
Figures also show that domestic debt, driven by short-term bills, totaled 36.3 billion yuan in February, up 50 percent year-on-year, ending a five-way decline.
记者注意到，2020年以来，旭辉集团在融资方面颇为积极。
Reporters noted that since 2020, Xuan Hui Group in financing is quite active.
截至发稿，共融资93亿元，在各大房企中排名第二。
As of the date of distribution, a total of 9.3 billion yuan, in the second largest housing enterprises.
2月18日，旭辉集团公告称，与香港渣打银行签订贷款协议，涉及一笔2亿美元的定期贷款融资。
On February 18, Sunshine Group announced that it had signed a loan agreement with Standard Chartered Bank of Hong Kong, involving a $200m term loan facility.
这已是旭辉进入2020年后第4笔美元债，此次还款期限仅为6个月，可见其对于“资金”的饥渴程度。
This is the fourth dollar debt Asahi has entered the post-2020 period, only six months, showing how hungry he is for "money."
早在1月7日，旭辉就一笔4亿美元的6.0%优先票据与初始购买方订立购买协议；两天后，又就额外发行2025年到期的1.67亿美元优先票据与汇丰及瑞士信贷订立购买协议，票面利率为6.0%，与16日发行的4亿美元优先票据合并及构成单一类别。
As early as January 7, Asahi entered into a purchase agreement with the initial buyer for a $400 million 6.0% priority note, and two days later with HSBC and Credit Suisse for the issuance of an additional $167 million of priority notes maturing in 2025 at a coupon rate of 6.0 per cent, merging with the $400 million issued on the 16th and constituting a single category.
此外，1月22日，旭辉还与招商银行订立贷款协议，获提供一笔合共3.85亿港元的两年定期贷款融资。
On January 22, Xuan also entered into a loan agreement with China Merchants Bank to provide a total of HK $385 million in two-year term loan financing.
旭辉集团相关负责人在接受记者采访时表示，近期，公司完成4笔境外美元债的发行，并获批银行信贷额度作为短期储备，“是为企业发展储备粮草，以增加公司经营灵活性”。
In an interview with reporters, the company recently completed the issuance of four offshore dollar bonds and was granted bank lines of credit as short-term reserves to "develop grain and grass for the development of enterprises in order to increase the flexibility of the company's operations."
旭辉集团CEO林峰在谈到现金流问题时也表示，融资回款最近会有一个窗口期，政策导向把债务延期，但是不能做增量，所以有很多短贷的到期，政府会开闸做延缓，至少能让企业倒腾一下债务周期。
Speaking about cash flow, Mr. Lam, CEO of Asahi Group, also said the fund-raising money will have a window recently, policy-oriented debt extensions, but not increments, so there are a lot of short-term maturities that the government will open to slow, or at least cause companies to churn out the debt cycle.
但应对“黑天鹅”，最核心的就是控制负债率，平常就要严格守住一些财务纪律，包括短债比、现金余额、销贷比。
But to deal with the "black swan," the most important thing is to control debt ratio, usually strict adherence to a number of financial discipline, including short-term debt ratio, cash balance, loan ratio.
开源节流3月4日，央行召开金融支持疫情防控和经济社会发展座谈会再次强调坚持“房住不炒”定位和“不将房地产作为短期刺激经济的手段”要求，保持房地产金融政策的连续性、一致性、稳定性。
On March 4, the Central Bank convened a symposium on financial support for disease control and economic and social development, emphasizing once again the requirements of upholding the position of "no housing without fire" and "no real estate as a means of stimulating the economy in the short term," so as to maintain the continuity, consistency and stability of real estate financial policies.
各地也纷纷推出“涉房救市”政策。
Everywhere also rolled out the "housing rescue" policy.
记者梳理发现，政策大致分为两个方面，一是助力融资端“减负”，包括对符合条件的房企增加信贷渠道与额度，加快贷款审批发放速度，有条件地给予展期等信贷支持等政策；二是在拿地、销售等环节为房企“省钱”或放松条件，包括延期或分期缴纳土地出让金，顺延开工、竣工等期限，调整预售条件等方面。
Reporter carding found that the policy can be broadly divided into two aspects, one is to help qualified housing enterprises to "reduce the burden," including the qualified housing enterprises to increase the credit channels and quotas, speed up loan approval and conditional extension of credit support;
同策咨询研究中心总监张宏伟说：“大批房企将面临‘地主家也没有余粮’的困境，这是一个普遍性的行业问题。
Zhang Hongwei, director of the Policy Consulting Center, said: "A large number of housing companies will face the 'homeowners do not have surplus' dilemma, which is a universal industry issue.
”“从长远角度来看，企业2020年在开源节流方面需要有可落地的规划。
"In the long run, companies need to have a down-to-earth plan in 2020 to generate revenue."
”亿翰智库研报也认为，一方面，要促进回款，适当降价跑量，注重提升产品品质，提高产品的溢价能力。
On the one hand, he argues, it is necessary to boost cash flow, cut prices appropriately, pay attention to improving product quality and raising the premium capacity of products.
同时，要适时清库存，老盘可以考虑提前开发，新获优质地块可以调整开工节奏，尽快转化为可售库存；另一方面，在当前的市场环境下，建议资金并不是很充裕的房企，减少土地投资支出，保证资金安全是第一要务。
At the same time, to clear the inventory in time, the old market can consider early development, new high-quality land can adjust the start-up rhythm, as soon as possible into saleable inventory; on the other hand, in the current market environment, the proposed capital is not very abundant housing enterprises, reduce land investment expenditure, ensure the security of funds is the first priority.
抱团取暖将是一种趋势，合作拿地与开发也是渡过难关的不错选择。
Clustering will be a trend, and co-location and development will be a good way out.
