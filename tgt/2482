文 | 谢九在中国的疫情逐渐缓和之际，中国之外的疫情却突然爆发升级。
While China's epidemic has subsided, outbreaks outside China have suddenly escalated.
2月25日以来，中国境外新增的确诊病例已经超过了中国境内，新冠肺炎疫情进入全球化的2.0阶段。
Since February 25, the number of new cases confirmed outside China has surpassed that in China, and the outbreak of pneumonia has entered the 2.0 stage of globalization.
目前，韩国的新增确诊人数已经超过了中国，日本、伊朗、意大利等国都开始成为重灾区，疫情已经蔓延到全球五大洲40多个国家。
South Korea now has more new cases than China, and countries such as Japan, Iran and Italy are beginning to be hard hit, with the epidemic spreading to more than 40 countries on five continents.
世卫总干事谭德塞28日宣布，将新冠肺炎疫情的全球风险级别由“高”上调到“非常高”，多个国家也发出警告，新冠肺炎疫情可能会全球大流行。
The global risk of pneumonia has been raised from "high" to "very high," and several countries have warned of a possible global pandemic, WHO director General Theresa Tupper said Monday.
随着疫情在全球范围内升级，一向最为敏感的美国股市开始暴跌，在刚刚过去的一周之内跌幅超过12%，在美国股市的带动之下，全球股市也随之大幅跳水。
As the epidemic escalated around the world, traditionally the most sensitive U.S. stock market began to plummet, dropping more than 12% in the past week, followed by a sharp plunge in global equity markets, led by U.S. stocks.
疫情带来的全球大恐慌，直到最近才刚刚开始。
The global panic caused by the epidemic has only recently begun.
而在此前中国爆发疫情的一个多月时间里，以美国为首的全球股市基本上没有太大的反应，甚至中国A股市场也仅仅只是短期暴跌，很快就强劲反弹。
More than a month after the outbreak in China, the US-led global stock market was largely unresponsive, and even China's A-share market was only a short-term slump and quickly rebounded strongly.
全球资本市场之所以表现淡定，主要原因在于，人们大多认为中国的新冠肺炎疫情虽然会对全球经济带来冲击，但这种影响还是局部性和短期性。
The main reason for the lacklustre performance of global capital markets is the widespread perception that China's new crown pneumonia outbreak, while having an impact on the global economy, is localized and short-term.
一个最明显的例子就是，苹果公司在2月17日发布业绩预警公告，表示受到疫情影响，季度营收目标将无法实现，但是公司股价并没有出现大跌，反而小幅上涨。
One of the clearest examples of this was Apple's February 17 performance announcement that quarterly revenue targets would not be met because of the epidemic, but the company's share price did not fall sharply but edged up.
因为在投资者看来，随着中国疫情得到控制，短期影响很快就会消失。
As investors see it, the short-term impact will soon dissipate as the Chinese epidemic is brought under control.
但是，随着疫情开始逐渐在全球范围内爆发，投资者开始意识到，这场新冠肺炎疫情的影响大大超出了预期，对于经济的冲击将不再只是局部和短期影响，而是可能会升级为全面长期的冲击，对于本已脆弱不堪的全球经济，很难承受如此级别的意外伤害。
But, as the epidemic begins to spread across the globe, investors are beginning to realize that the impact of the new crown-pneumonia epidemic far exceeds expectations, and that the impact on the economy will no longer be local and short-term, but could escalate into a full-blown long-term shock of such magnitude that it would be difficult to sustain an already fragile global economy.
投资者的恐慌情绪终于决堤，全球资本市场集体暴跌。
Investor panic has finally burst, and global capital markets have collapsed collectively.
还是以苹果公司来看，公司在2月17日发布业绩预警时，投资者并没有引起重视，而随着疫情在全球扩散升级，公司股价从2月24日开始大跌，这也是美国股市集体暴跌的开始。
Or at Apple, investors didn't pay much attention when the company issued its February 17 earnings warning, and as the epidemic escalated around the world, share prices began to plummet on Feb. 24, the beginning of a collective stock-market slump.
图 | 视觉中国次贷危机之后，美国股市从2009年开始，迎来一轮长达10年的牛市，在过去10年时间里，虽然也经历很多全球性恐慌性事件，但从没有像近期这样，几天之内持续暴跌，这样的走势，只在2008年次贷危机最黑暗的时刻出现过，很多人开始认为，美国这一轮长达10年的牛市，最终可能要止步于这场新冠肺炎疫情。
After seeing China's subprime crisis, the U.S. stock market began a 10-year bull market in 2009, and has seen many global panic events for the past decade, but never more recently than in the darkest days of the 2008 subprime crisis.
随着美国股市暴跌，投资者开始买进美国国债避险，美国10年期国债收益率快速下降，跌破了1.4%的警戒线，按照美国经济学界的定义，这意味着发出了经济即将衰退的强烈信号。
As US stock markets plummeted and investors began buying Treasuries to avoid risk, US 10-year Treasury yields fell rapidly, falling below the 1.4 per cent threshold, which, according to US economists, signaled a strong signal of an imminent recession.
以美国为首的全球股市之所以如此恐慌，主要原因在于，投资者担心如果新冠肺炎疫情按照这样的趋势发展下去，全球经济可能会被拖垮。
The main reason why US-led stock markets are so panicked is because investors fear the global economy could be dragged down if the outbreak continues.
因为刚刚过去的2019年，全球经济原本就已经疲态尽显，主要经济体大都创下近年来最低增速，很多经济学家甚至将当前经济和上世纪30年代的大萧条相提并论。
With the global economy already in tatters in 2019, with most of the major economies experiencing the lowest growth rates in recent years, many economists liken the current economy to the Great Depression of the 1930s.
在这样的背景下，如果新冠肺炎在全球蔓延扩散，已经处于衰退边缘的世界经济无疑会雪上加霜，可能会进入真正的大衰退。
Against this backdrop, if the new crown pneumonia spreads around the world, the world economy, already on the brink of recession, will no doubt get worse, perhaps into a real Great Recession.
如果对当前的全球经济的低迷现状有所了解，就不难理解当前全球资本市场为何如此恐慌。
Given the current global economic downturn, it is easy to understand why global capital markets are panicking so much.
以几个发达经济体来看，刚刚过去的2019年，美国GDP增长了2.3%，不仅远低于3%的预期目标，也创下3年来的新低，随着特朗普的财政刺激和税改红利逐渐消退，美国经济又失去了增长动力，去年下半年以来，美国的很多经济指标就已经发出了衰退的信号，以至于美联储在去年实施了3次降息。
In several advanced economies, US GDP grew by 2.3% in the recent 2019, well below the 3% target and a three-year low. As Trump's fiscal stimulus and tax-reform dividend waned, the US economy lost momentum, with many US economic indicators showing signs of recession since the second half of last year, leading the Fed to cut interest rates three times last year.
欧洲更是一直深陷泥潭难以自拔，欧债危机以来，欧洲经济就一直处于衰退边缘，随着最近几年国际贸易环境恶化，领头羊德国的经济增速显著下滑，2019年仅仅增长了0.6%。
Europe has been on the brink of a recession since the European debt crisis, with Germany, the bellwether of growth, recording only 0.6 per cent growth in 2019, as the international trading environment deteriorated in recent years.
日本经济更是长期徘徊不前，去年仅仅增长了0.7%，尤其是去年四季度，更是陷入负增长。
Japan's economy has been stagnant for a long time, growing by only 0.7% last year, especially in the fourth quarter, when it turned negative.
日本原本寄望东京奥运会能够提振经济，结果随着疫情升级，更是面临奥运会被取消的风险，这对日本经济又是一记重创。
Japan had hoped that the Tokyo Olympics would boost the economy, only to face the risk of the games being canceled as the epidemic escalated, another blow to the Japanese economy.
日本超市里，部分纸类被抢空新兴经济体这几年成为全球经济增长的主要贡献者，但是经济增速也是明显放缓。
In Japanese supermarkets, some paper has been shorted. Emerging economies have been major contributors to global growth in recent years, but growth has slowed markedly.
中国经济增速在去年增长了6.1%，创下了20多年来的新低。
China's economy grew 6.1 percent last year, its lowest level in more than two decades.
印度最近几年高速增长，一度成为全球增长冠军，但是从去年开始，印度神话也开始破灭，从将近8%的增速断崖式下跌到5%，也是10多年来的新低。
India has grown rapidly in recent years, once the world's growth champion, but since last year the myth of India has also started to unravel, dropping from a nearly 8 per cent cliff to 5 per cent, its lowest level in more than a decade.
面对各自的困境，主要经济体都在寻找新的办法和出路，但除了放松财政和货币政策，也并没有太有效的办法，2019年，全球已经有几十个国家集体降息刺激经济，已经不难看出当前全球经济的疲软程度。
In the face of their respective dilemmas, major economies are looking for new approaches and ways out, but there is little effective alternative to easing fiscal and monetary policy. In 2019, dozens of countries around the world cut interest rates collectively to stimulate the economy, and it is not hard to see how weak the global economy is now.
如果新冠肺炎疫情不能得到及时控制最终席卷全球，脆弱的全球经济很难承受这样的打击。
If the outbreak of pneumonia is not brought under control in time to engulf the world, the fragile global economy will not be able to withstand such a blow.
为了控制疫情，全球各国将会不可避免的收缩经济活动，即使控制程度不如中国，经济扩张的速度也还是会大受影响。
To contain the epidemic, countries around the world will inevitably contract economic activity, even if it is less contained than China's, and the pace of economic expansion will be greatly affected.
为了保护本国居民，各国之间会加强入境管制，国与国之间的很多经济活动将接近停摆，旅游、教育、投资等等都会大幅萎缩。
In order to protect their populations, immigration controls would be strengthened, many economic activities between countries would come to a halt, and tourism, education, investment, etc., would shrink dramatically.
在当前全球化时代，没有一个国家可以脱离别国而单独存在，当全球经济的活力从内到外都开始萎缩，经济增长将会螺旋式下降，如果疫情持续时间过长，全球经济大衰退绝非危言耸听。
In the current era of globalization, in which no country can stand alone, when the dynamism of the global economy begins to shrink from the inside out, economic growth will spiral downward, and if the epidemic continues for too long, the global recession will not be alarmist.
在经济大衰退之际，民粹主义势力往往会趁机抬头，从人类发展历史来看，极端情况下，有些国家甚至会通过战争来寻找出路，比如“二战”前的德国等等。
Populist forces tend to rise in the midst of the Great Recession, and, in extreme cases, countries have used war to find a way out, such as Germany before World War II.
而事实证明，战争带来大量的战时需求，的确可以刺激经济增长，比如美国，在30年代大萧条之后，真正拯救美国经济的不是罗斯福新政，而是“二战”，二战爆发后，美国经济在短短几年之内实现翻番，从此确立了世界霸主的地位。
In the United States, for example, it was not Roosevelt's New Deal that really saved America's economy after the Great Depression, but "World War II," when the US economy doubled in just a few years, establishing itself as the world's dominant power.
从当前来看，经济危机引发全球战争的可能性并不大，不过，另外一种形式的战争概率并不低，那就是贸易战。
At the moment, the economic crisis is unlikely to trigger a global war, but the other form of warfare is not so unlikely: a trade war.
刚刚有所缓和的贸易战，会不会在疫情带来的经济压力之下开始重新抬头？无疑是当前值得警惕的事情。
Whether the trade war, which has just eased somewhat, will begin to rise again under the economic pressure of the epidemic is no doubt a matter of alarm.
图 | 视觉中国历史已经证明，发动贸易战争，不仅无助于本国经济，反而会加速全球危机。
As China's history has demonstrated, waging trade wars does not help its own economy, but rather accelerates global crises.
上世纪30年代的大萧条，一个很重要的导火索是，美国在1930年出台了《关税法》，对海外商品大幅加征关税，平均幅度接近20%。
An important trigger of the Great Depression of the 1930 "s was the introduction in the United States of the Tariff Act of 1930, which imposed significant tariffs on overseas goods, averaging nearly 20 per cent.
美国的《关税法》引发他国报复，上演了一场全球贸易大战，全球贸易额大幅萎缩，最终加速了美国乃至全球的经济衰退，引发了历史上最著名的那场全球大萧条。
The United States Customs Act triggered retaliation by unleashing a global trade war, in which the volume of global trade shrank dramatically, eventually accelerating the recession in the United States and around the world, triggering the most famous global depression in history.
当前这场全球蔓延的新冠肺炎疫情，对人类的智慧也是一个考验。
The current global outbreak of new crown pneumonia is also a test of human wisdom.
只有全球携手合作，而不是以邻为壑，才是解决这场危机的真正出路。
Only a global partnership, not beggar-thy-neighbour, is the real way out of this crisis.
