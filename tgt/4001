收听本文13:46 将灾难做成游戏是一件很困难的事情。
It's hard to make a game out of a disaster.
和游戏应该给人带来的放松，愉悦和快乐不同，灾难中所蕴涵的悲剧性让任何制作组都很难把这一类的题材做成游戏。
Unlike the relaxing, pleasurable, and pleasurable games that play, the tragedy of disasters makes it difficult for any production group to play games on such subjects.
反之，这一题材如果将其过分的娱乐化，又会造成“不谨慎游戏”的结果，会有对于受害者不够尊重的嫌疑。
On the other hand, if this subject is over-entertaining, it will result in "careless game", there will be a lack of respect for the victims.
新型冠状病毒无疑是这样的灾难。
The new coronavirus is certainly such a disaster.
事实上，一切将这种灾难娱乐化的“游戏”都不应该开发制作，比如前几日在Steam上发布的《冠状病毒模拟器》就是这样的游戏。
In fact, any "game" that entertains this kind of disaster should not be developed, as in the case of the Coronavirus Simulator, which was launched on Steam the other day.
这一题材的另一种形式则在于游戏内容可以站在完全中立，冷酷且理性立场上进行事实陈述，比如在新冠病毒爆发之后大火的《瘟疫公司》，游戏仅仅描述了灾难发生后的景象。
Another form of this subject is the fact that the content of the game can be presented in a completely neutral, cold, and rational manner, as in Plague Company, the fire that followed the outbreak of the New Crown Virus, which described only the aftermath of the disaster.
更重要的是，它站在一种很高的立场上，非常宏观的看待瘟疫的影响，在游戏中，徒然增长的死亡，感染人数并不会让你感同身受。
More importantly, it stands from a very high position, very macro view of the impact of the plague, in the game, futile growth in death, the number of infected people will not let you feel the same.
可是如果游戏本身以一种很近的视角去描述在“新冠疫情”中的医生呢？如果游戏中玩家需要对身处疫情中的人也感同身受？这样的游戏是否合适呢？《逆行者》便是这样一款游戏，它汇聚了国内60个游戏行业的相关人士。
But what if the game itself takes a very close look at the doctors involved in the Crown Epidemic? If players in the game need to empathize with people in the epidemic, is that right? Reverse Walker is a game that brings together players from 60 gaming industries in the country.
这些游戏开发者用15天的时间用Unity将这款游戏开发出来。
The game developers spent 15 days developing the game with Unity.
游戏的主要内容是以灾难中的不同的人的视角来描述他们的遭遇，借此来表达对于这些“逆行者”的敬意。
The main content of the game is to describe their experiences from the perspective of different people in a disaster, as a way of showing respect for the "Reverse."
如果我们将这款游戏作为一个“游戏”的标准来看，游戏的内容却实在是有些匮乏，相关的游戏机制也过于简陋。
If we look at this game as a "game" standard, the content of the game is a bit scarce, the relevant game mechanism is too crude.
游戏的平均游玩时间在15-20分钟左右，与其说是一个传统意义上的游戏，更像是一个在游戏外表下的视觉短篇故事。
The average play time of 15-20 minutes is not so much a traditional game as a short visual story under the surface of the game.
当我们将游戏和电影，文学等同为艺术的话，那么在这些文化载体之中，对于现实的灾难都有着深刻而优秀的作品，他们不会因为题材的原因而受到影响。
When we equate game and film, literature with art, there are profound and excellent works about real disasters in these carriers, and they are not affected by the subject matter.
人们在观看，收听这些作品的时候也会感受到制作者的敬意，或感动或欣慰。
People watching, listening to these works will also feel the producer's respect, or moved or relieved.
游戏则不一样。
The game is different.
因为游戏本身所具有的互动性，加上现实题材的敏感以及舆论环境中的困难，让目前不太会有人对这种游戏进行开发制作。
Because of the interactive nature of the game itself, coupled with the sensitivity of the subject matter and the difficulties of the public opinion environment, the game is currently less likely to be developed and produced.
、而制作这种游戏的人，无疑也是这种环境的“逆行者”“蹭热度”的题材，逆行的开发者在Taptap上，逆行者的开发者写的是ACE游戏社。
The game's creators, no doubt, are also the subject of "Inverter" and "Ride Heat," the retrograde developer on Taptap and the reverse developer on ACE.
ACE游戏社是《逆行者》的主策划Klaus的公司，在《逆行者》之前，他们公司旗下有三款游戏。
ACE Games is the company of Klaus, the mastermind of Reverse Walker, which had three games under its banner before Inverter.
他们最早的游戏是《美食家小猪的大冒险》。
Their first game was The Great Adventures of Gourmet Pigs.
在游戏的介绍中，我们可以看到”ACE游戏社是由Klaus（程序、策划）、Shiney（文案）、7（主美术）、Mokoto（副美术）四名大学生组成的，他们每个人来自不同的大学，出于热爱一起利用课余时间开发独立游戏。
In the introduction to the game, we can see that "ACE Game Club" is composed of four college students, Klaus (program, planning), Shiney (copywriting), 7 (Main Fine Arts) and Mokoto (Associate Fine Arts).
这也是他们所开发的第一款游戏。
It was also the first game they developed.
”而在ACE游戏社的第二款的游戏《食旅山海》中，介绍则变成了“大家好，我是ACE游戏社的制作人Klaus. 大学毕业后，我没有选择国外游戏公司的Offer, 直接开始了我自己的游戏人生，创立了杭州初宇游戏科技有限公司（ACE Entertainment）但我还是喜欢叫他“ACE游戏社”。
In ACE's second game, "The Sea of Food," the introduction became "Hello everyone, I'm Klaus, the producer of ACE Games." Instead of choosing Offer from a foreign game company, I started my own gaming life and founded ACE Entertainment, but I liked to call him ACE.
《食旅山海》也是我创立公司后的第一款手游项目，项目中的成员目前都是刚出学校的朋友。
"Food Travel Sea" is also my first hand tour since the establishment of the company, the members of the project are just out of school friends.
”我们不难发现，开发《逆行者》的主策划和部分开发人员便是来自于ACE游戏社的。
It's not hard to see that the master planner and some of the developers who developed The Reverse came from ACE.
这家游戏公司从学生时期开始聚集开发独立游戏，到大学毕业之后Klaus选择了成立创业公司，制作游戏。
The game company began gathering to develop independent games as a student, and after graduating from college Klaus chose to start a startup and make games.
游戏公司成立的时间也不久，目前还并没有一款正式商业运作的游戏，和这个行业中比较有经验的开发者相比，这些人无疑是比较年轻的开发者。
The game company has not been around long enough to have a full-fledged commercial game yet, and these people are definitely younger developers than the industry's more experienced developers.
尽管在署名上，游戏的开发者是ACE游戏社。
Although signed, the game developer is ACE Games.
《逆行者》这款游戏并不能说是ACE游戏社所开发的，因为除了ACE游戏社的成员之外，也有很多外来的开发者。
The game "Reverse Walker" cannot be said to have been developed by ACE, because there are many extraneous developers in addition to ACE members.
在组内一开始也有人因为署名的问题发生过质疑，以为是掉入某种商业陷阱。
At the beginning of the group, questions were also raised about the attribution of names, suggesting that they had fallen into some kind of business trap.
不过后来，Klaus将所有参与的人都放在了游戏末尾的Staff表上，也打消了其他制作者的疑问。
But Klaus later put all those involved on the Staff table at the end of the game, dispelling the doubts of other producers.
据主策划Klaus所说“游戏一开始是在我们自己团队里面宣传，那个时候其实算是放假。
According to Klaus, the mastermind, "the game was initially advertised within our own team, and it was actually a holiday."
我也没强迫团队里的人来帮我。
I didn't force the team to help me either.
后面慢慢的扩展开，来了很多游戏圈得朋友，朋友的朋友。
Slowly the expansion of the rear, came a lot of game circle friends, friends.
"，最后这些朋友以及朋友的朋友汇集了60多人，在这些人之中，有程序，有策划，也有美术，对于这些人Klaus也进行了统一而且系统化的管理。
At last these friends and their friends assembled more than 60 people among whom there were procedures, plans and fine arts and who were administered in a uniform and systematic manner.
在策划方面Klaus将这些人分了3个小组，去做3条线的分镜。
In terms of planning, Klaus divided the men into three groups to work on three separate mirrors.
每天都在变换更好的工作工作流程；同时在程序方面，在正式开始制作的第二天就开始分配出了不同模块的任务。
Better workflows are being changed every day; at the procedural level, tasks are assigned to different modules on the second day of production.
而美术部分的人员也类似策划分组成了3个组每个组对应一个不同的视角。
The staff of the fine arts section are similarly organized into three groups, each with a different perspective.
同时，他也在设计方面定好了规则，保证虽然分组但是研发出来的产品是一致的。
At the same time, he set the rules for the design, ensuring that the products developed in groups were consistent.
与其说《逆行者》是谁的作品，这个游戏更像是多个游戏行业内不同岗位的从业者们的合作产物。
Rather than being a product of whose work is The Reverse, the game is more like a collaboration between practitioners in many different positions in the game industry.
在Taptap的论坛上，有一名开发组内的程序就表示，自己当初就是看到朋友圈有人要搞个公益游戏，“想想自己一个写代码的，好像也的确没啥能给国家出力的，就进群看了看，想着能干啥干点啥，这一看就是一直干到现在。
At the Taptap forum, a program within the development group said that it had been until now that it had seen a pro bono game in its circle of friends. "Think of yourself as someone who writes code and doesn't seem to be contributing anything to the country.
”像是这样的人还有很多，在《逆行者》的开发团队之中，他们之中很多人都没有见过面，只是在网上进行多地协作。
There are plenty of people like this, and many of them have never met before in the Reverse development team and just collaborate more and more on the Web.
不过，像是这样比较松散的协作也产生了问题。
However, looser collaboration like this also creates problems.
随着疫情逐渐恢复，很多人都回到了工作岗位上，这时候游戏能玩的包还没有出来。
As the epidemic recovers and many people return to work, the game's playable bags are yet to come out.
这些制作者白天要上班工作，晚上回家还要继续开发游戏，很多制作组的人都表示，Klaus和一些其他组的组长都为了游戏熬夜到两三点，甚至通宵。
The producers worked during the day and continued to develop their games when they returned home at night, and many of the team leaders said Klaus and some other group leaders stayed up until two or three o'clock, or even all night, for the game.
然而，在开发的过程中，他们也遭受到了质疑。
However, in the process of development, they also encountered challenges.
在游戏发布之后，《逆行者》的预约人数开始快速增长。
After the game was released, the number of intrepid bookings began to grow rapidly.
很快的，游戏就登上了Tap的排行榜，上榜之后，关注的玩家更多了。
Soon, the game appeared on the Tap charts, and after that, there were more players on the list.
在Taptap上，我们能看到关注的人数已经到达60000多人。
On Taptap, we can see that the number of people of concern has reached more than 60,000.
有一些人对于游戏本身是不是“蹭热度”这件事情表示了质疑。
Some have questioned whether the game itself is "a bit of a craze".
他们认为在这个时间点，推出一款和武汉新冠疫情相关的游戏，就是在“蹭热度”。
At this point in time, they say, launching a game related to Wuhan's new crown epidemic is "warming up."
对于这个事情，Klaus却觉得“你可以认为我们就是蹭热度，我们是想在现在的热度上，更深一下的让大家记住这些逆行者们。
For this, Klaus thought, "You can think we're just rubbing off the heat. We're trying to remember the Reverse more deeply in the current heat."
我们其实没什么所图，这件事情也耽误了我们很多的正常工作。
We don't really have anything on our minds. It also slows down a lot of our normal work.
”而在Tap论坛上那位组内的程序员则表达的更为激烈“ 我们不收费不发广告，又不挣钱，又不成立公司，蹭这个热度何用？没有充值入口，不收费，没有广告植入，我们发哪门子财了？况且，做收费是需要游戏著作权、游戏版号的，广告也是要申请广告位的，这些都需要时间，我们根本来不及的，光申请一个软件著作权就一个月过去了，更何况我们不会申请这个东西，署名都没法署，这么多人没法搞的 。
And the programmer in the Tap forum said more vehemently, "We don't charge for advertising, we don't make money and we don't have a company.
”在这样的时间点，制作这样的一款游戏，难免会遭受到他人的非议。
At such a point in time, making a game like this is inevitably subject to criticism from others.
在顺风顺水什么都不做也不会苛责的情况下去做些什么，这些人本身就是一种“逆行者”。
What to do in the wind with nothing to do and nothing to blame, these people themselves are a kind of "inverse."
“借鉴”的玩法，所有人都能通关的游戏对于《逆行者》的另一种质疑在于游戏的玩法。
Another problem with Inverse is the way in which the game is played.
在游戏的介绍中，Klaus表示"因为时间紧迫，为了最大的开发效率，我们借鉴了很多影响我们很深的成功的作品使得在短时间内拥有了完整度。
In the game's introduction, Klaus says & quot; because time was pressing, we borrowed many of our highly successful projects to make it complete in a short time, for maximum development efficiency.
”玩过游戏的人不难发现，游戏中的玩法主要是借鉴了2018年的TGA最佳移动游戏《Florence》，游戏中，玩家的基本操作和《Florence》很像，都是要进行和场景的互动来推动游戏的叙事进行。
Players can easily discover that the game is based on 2018 TGA's best mobile game, Florence, in which the basic actions of the player are similar to those of Florence, all about interacting with the scene to advance the narrative of the game.
拼图的对话框也是《Florence》的经典设计借鉴这个事情，Klaus也很坦诚的承认了，“玩法很多参考就是来自于成功的产品《Florence》，我觉得一些简单灵巧的玩法是需要沉淀的，这也的确是我们做的不够的地方，仅仅20天的时间，其实我们没有那么多时间去做一些事情。
The jigsaw puzzle is also the classic design of Florence, Klaus concedes frankly that "a lot of references to the game come from the successful product, Florence." I think some simple dexterous games need to be precipitated, which is really not enough for us.
但是我觉得我们游戏出了玩法外，3线交叉等设计是我们自己做的，并觉得做的还算合格的。
But I think we play the game out of the way, the 3-wire crossover design is our own done, and feel that the doing is fairly qualified.
”在其他的采访中，Klaus也说过在他自己看来游戏是否好玩可能是这一类游戏中第二位要考虑的事情，更加重要的是想法是否能传达到，如果能够做出又好玩，又能传达自己的想法的游戏固然好，但是更重要的是要清楚自己更想把哪个放在第一位。
In other interviews, Klaus also said that in his own mind, whether the game was fun was probably the second most important consideration in the game, and more importantly whether the ideas were passed on.
《逆行者》的游戏的时间很短，玩家在15-20分钟左右便能够通关。
Reverse Walker is a short game in which players can go through customs in about 15-20 minutes.
制作组表示，这是是刻意将游戏的时长制作成这样的，他们更加希望这是一个所有人都能通关的游戏，就算是从来没有玩过游戏的人也能够通过这个游戏感受到制作组想要表达的内容。
The team said it was a deliberate attempt to create a game that everyone can play, and that even people who have never played a game can sense what the production team wants to say.
在游戏中，玩家要分别扮演病人，医生以及医生家属。
In the game, the player plays the patient, the doctor and the doctor's family.
通过这三种人不同的角度去看待新冠疫情所造成的影响。
The impact of the new crown epidemic is viewed from the different perspectives of the three groups.
游戏中的“逆行者”则是在新冠疫情中挺身而出的医生。
The "Reverse Walker" in the game is the doctor who stands up for the new crown.
在剧情中，家属对自己身为医生的爱人的担心，医生对于自己职责的负责以及病人的感谢都有表现。
In the plot, the family expresses its fear of their beloved as a doctor, the doctor's responsibility for his or her duties, and the patient's gratitude.
之所以将游戏的名字取名为《逆行者》也是如此，Klaus取名的原因就是“微博上经常刷到这个词，他觉得这个词很好的形容了那些一线的战士们。
So was the name of the game "Inverter," and the reason Klaus was named was "the word is often used on microblogs, which he thought was a good description of the front-line fighters.
有很多人觉得这就是他们的义务，但Klaus却觉得他们这是在逆行，他们也有权力去享受家庭。
Many felt that this was their duty, but Klaus felt that they were retrograde and that they had the right to enjoy their family.
"游戏的第三章最后一节的名字是《逆行》，在最后一节开始的时候，屏幕中出现一句话”等我回来，一起吃手枪腿“。
Running backwards is the title of the last chapter of the game. At the beginning of the last section, there was a line on the screen that said, "Wait for me to come back and have a pistol leg with me."
而当游戏中的医生在忙完了一天的工作之后，桌上放着的正是一个炸鸡腿。
And when the doctor in the game is busy with the day's work, there is a fried chicken leg on the table.
游戏中，在短暂的休息之后，医生和自己的爱人通了电话，报了平安。
In the game, after a short rest, the doctor and his lover on the phone, reported safe.
结束之后，他又穿上了防护服，朝着ICU的方向走去，只留下一个背影。
After that, he put on his suit and walked toward the ICU, leaving only a shadow.
在游戏的最后，那些现实中的“逆行者”的照片也一一出现：照顾病人的医生，上前线送物资的军人，没有防护服把非典的衣服拿出来再穿的护士。
At the end of the game, pictures of real-life "Reverse Walkers" appeared: doctors taking care of patients, soldiers on the front lines, nurses without protective clothing to take out SARS clothes and wear them again.
而在所有的照片前面，第一个出现的是因感染新冠肺炎去世的李文亮医生，他生前曾提过最爱德克士的手枪腿。
In front of all the pictures, the first was Dr. Lee Wenliang, who died of pneumonia, who had mentioned Dexter's favorite pistol leg.
如果你把这个游戏当成一个有着游戏性的传统游戏来期待，那么可能这种期待会落空。
If you look at the game as a traditional game with a gameplay to look forward to, then perhaps that expectation will come to naught.
因为在游戏性上，《逆行者》可以说几乎没有多少游戏；但是如果，你把它当作一个以游戏为媒介表达心中感情的作品的话，那么也许能感受到游戏人们想要表达的内容。
Because the Reverse has little to say game-playing; but if you think of it as a game in which to express your feelings, you may be able to feel what people want to say.
作为一款并不以盈利为目的的“公益”游戏，有多少的游戏性可能也就没那么重要了。
As a "public good" game that is not for profit, how much of a game is likely to be less important.
所谓“逆行者”指的是在所有人都朝着一个方向去走的时候，这个人反而去前往相反的方向。
The so-called "Reverse Walker" means that when everyone is going in one direction, the person is going in the opposite direction.
在天津爆炸案的时候，那些去事故现场的消防员是逆行者；在新冠疫情爆发的时候，去往武汉参与救援的医生也是逆行者。
At the time of the bombing in Tianjin, the firefighters who went to the scene of the accident were rebels, as were the doctors who went to Wuhan to help with the outbreak of the new crown.
Klaus在开始制作之前也曾怀疑过这件事情的意义，也想过如果开工之前做不完应该怎么办，但是他最终还是选择了开始做。
Klaus had doubts about the significance of the matter before he started, and thought about what to do if he could not finish before starting work, but he did so.
而目前看到用户的反馈，他觉得游戏想要传达出去的内容已经传达到了，这件事情有没有意义也已经不再重要了。
Now that he has seen feedback from users, he feels that what the game is trying to convey has been passed on, and it doesn't matter whether it makes sense or not.
如果只是跬步不前，瞻前顾后，想的如果太多，那么可能就不会做这件事情。
If the steps are ascending, the steps are ascending, and if you think too much, you will probably not do it.
逆行者有时候指的又是另一种人，他们有勇气去面对风险，去在别人质疑的时候一样坚持做自己觉得对的事情，在大部分人都觉得怕招来麻烦的时候，愿意先去做，再去想意义。
The Reverse is sometimes referring to another person who has the courage to face up to risk, to do what is right when others question, and to do it first when most people are afraid of getting into trouble.
这也是逆行者的另一种含义。
This is another meaning of the Reverse.

对于我们这个时代的人记性太珍贵了。
It is too precious for people of our time to remember.
年轻人在开工之后就肯定会需要把大量的时间和精力投入自己的工作和家庭；年纪大些的人也会渐渐觉得感染不感染都是「命」然后也把这次的事件也忘记了（邓安庆笔笔下的自己老家的父亲就是如此）。
Young people must put a lot of time and energy into their work and family when they start work; older people will start to feel infected or not infected and then forget about the incident (Deng Anqing pen's father in his own hometown).
无论是从这群志愿做游戏的人在开工后需要把精力更多地放在能养家糊口的主业上来说，还是从想要在人们逐渐习惯、漠视、忘记这次新冠疫情之前，用作品来呼吁尽可能多的人记忆、反思的角度来说，都是需要把游戏越快做出来越好。
Whether it's the volunteer gamers who need to focus more on the main job of supporting their families after work starts, or whether they want to appeal to as many people as possible for memory and reflection before people get used to, ignore and forget about the new crown, the sooner the game needs to be done.

11 ・ Respond to the report of Minor Mini Millikavin 2020-02-23 I agree with you that Chuang needs to support his family after returning to work.
但是我依然觉得，如果想通过游戏抵抗遗忘，难道不应该让这个游戏本身首先是个质量过硬、能够一直被人记住的作品吗。
But I still feel that if you want to fight forgetfulness through the game, shouldn't the game itself be first and foremost a quality work that can be remembered all the time?
而且，主创把这个本来也不需要盈利的游戏打磨的更久一点，等到大家快要忘记这场瘟疫的时候再放出来，不是更能唤起人们的记忆吗？我是站着说话不嫌腰疼，但是这个游戏既然通过文章给自己宣传，我觉得就得经得起别人的质疑。
What's more, the originator grinds this game, which does not need to be profitable, a little longer, until we are about to forget the plague to release it? I am standing to speak pain, but the game through their own propaganda, I feel that others have to withstand the challenge.

然而逆行者更多的表达一种情绪，好不好玩其实连写游戏的本工程师们都不关心。
However, the inverse more to express a mood, how to play in fact even the game of the engineers do not care.
但我战不一样，从一开始的庇护所玩法加萨拉热窝战争题材的组合，再到其他的成员的出谋划策，细细打磨，最后展现出来的，是爆款，是一个令人深思的艺术品。
But I fought differently, from the beginning of the shelter to play Fagin Sarajevo war theme combination, to the other members of the strategy, fine grinding, the final show is explosive money, is a thought-provoking artwork.
可能玩完逆行者，我会向那些一线奋战的医生致敬，但玩完我战，我不仅会记得避难所门前的 fak the war，还会记得我第一个拿跑哥带着小刀去抢劫别人的晚上。
Maybe after the Reverse, I will pay homage to the doctors who fought on the front, but after I play, I remember not only the fak the war in front of the shelter, but also the night I first took my running brother with a knife to rob someone else.
所以为什么会有争议呢？其实我个人是不太认为逆行者做好了自己作为游戏的本分，何况连原团队甚至认为这影响到了自己的正常工作，那还有什么好说的呢？16回复・举报Lewandoe4295  ・2020-02-23这个游戏确实是有蹭热度的嫌疑，洗不掉的。
So why is it controversial? Actually, I personally don't think the Reverse is doing their job properly, and even if the original team thinks it interferes with their normal work.16 Reaction ・ Report Lewandoe 4295 2020-02-23 is really a game that can't be washed out.
而且我对于游戏内容和类似弗洛伦斯玩法的结合表示怀疑。
And I doubt the combination of game content and anything like Florence's.
弗洛伦斯玩法里互动的点，音乐，颜色的运用，对话框拼接的玩法都有其为故事服务的意义。
The points of interaction in Florence's play, the use of music, the use of color, and the way dialog mosaics work have their meaning for the story.
但逆行者中所谓互动的玩法我认为有些生搬硬套。
But the so-called interactive game among the insiders I think it's a bit of a cliche.
三线并行看似是创新，实际上什么都没讲好。
Third-line parallelism looks like innovation, but in fact nothing is said well.
我敬畏他们为了制作游戏加班加点的工作，相信他们真的是为了这次疫情在努力。
I fear that they are working overtime to make games and believe that they are really working on the epidemic.
但我也在想，如果这次在各大平台，受到人们关注的，是《这是我的战争》《我的孩子生命之泉》这样的游戏，是不是有更多过去从来没有玩游戏的人能稍微改变对游戏的看法，了解到游戏的魅力呢。
But I also wonder if if this time around the platforms, people are paying attention to games like "This is My War" and "My Children's Springs of Life," there are more people who have never played games before who can change their view of the game a little bit and understand its appeal.
总之，感谢那些在疫情最前线的逆行者。
All in all, thank the rebels who are at the forefront of the epidemic.

7 ・ Respond to Ph 2020-02-22 Do you have any misunderstanding about video games The game is obviously a success: If it is not kryptonian, free of charge, and the game is a medium of expression, I think the website where programmers report news of the epidemic is more meaningful than this game.
我还是觉得：罐头吃起来味道不咋地是一回事，有人愿意做罐头就是另一回事了至少比之前那位乌克兰黑暗料理加工商要好，只是这类游戏最好以后就一直别收费了吧6回复・举报三改贰式  ・2020-02-23这文评论区都比这文精彩！3回复・举报Dudidisan  ・2020-02-22不知道坦诚是不是另一种形式的鸡贼，没有什么适合说的话，我选择冷淡看待3回复・举报Dudidisan  Dudidisan・2020-02-22我没在游戏开头看到《Florence》的相关信息，结束时的人员表里也没有，往坏处讲，这叫消极诱导4回复・举报Dudidisan  Dudidisan・2020-02-22蹭热度都是小事，时势造英雄，非常时期就该有英雄凸显出来，但问题是——凸显出来的是英雄吗？文章里作者很坦诚，游戏里没看出来。
I still think it's one thing to be able to eat a can, and it's another thing to be willing to make a can - at least it's better than the dark Ukrainian processor's previous schedule. I don't know if this is another form of chicken thief.
两个游戏都是视频通关，说错了请骂我。
Both games are video clearance, said wrong please scold me.

2 ・ Reply ・ If you can tell a story with your heart, no one will mind pneumonia or cancer, but don't make this a low priority. Respond to Iolem 2020-02-23 for a disaster-making game that doesn't seem to be any different from writing a song about disaster over the past two days
有的人可能就是愿意玩这种专门为了灾难而做的游戏，愿意听为灾难写的歌，这些能让他们“铭记灾难”。
Some people may simply be willing to play the game of disaster, or listen to a song written for disaster, which allows them to "remember the disaster."
我不知道这是不是刻奇的一种表现，但是看到这样的报道和新闻的时候我总能在眼前浮现出一群人被刻奇折磨的样子，而我则被这群人的样子折磨。
I don't know if this is a sign of Kicky, but when I look at such stories and news, I always see a group of people who have been deliberately tortured, and I am tortured by this group.
他们表现出的感受并非虚假，无论感动也好心酸也好，在面对降临在身边的灾难时、看到那些勇于献身的勇士，正常人都会有相似的感受，但是这种感受距离他们口头上表达出来的形容词，怕是也有挺大差距。
The feelings they exhibit are not false, and they feel the same in the face of the calamity that befalls them, and in the face of those brave men who gave their lives. But that feeling is far removed from the adjectives they verbally express.
就像一个人感动时可能会打出“泪目”二字，他的感动是真的，但很少有人真的感动到打字的同时当场流下眼泪。
Just as a person may be moved when the word "tears", his move is true, but few people really touched the typewriter while crying.
做一款游戏，以时下最为众人瞩目的疫情为题材、尽全力在“短时间内”完成并推出、“借鉴”了其他游戏的优秀之处、不氪金不收费不打广告、没有游戏性也没关系，推出这样一部作品为的是让大家铭记那些逆行者，这个说法有毛病吗？没毛病。
Do a game, to the most eye-catching epidemic theme, and do their best in "short time" to complete and launch, "draw on" other game excellence, non-kryptonian do not charge no advertising, no game no matter, to launch such a work to let people remember those who reverse, this statement is not defective?
我相信他们做这款游戏时必然抱着一部分公益心态，但要说他们口中所说就是他们心中所想，我真的没法信。
I'm sure they play this game with a bit of a pro bono mentality, but if what they're saying is what they think, I really can't believe it.
大家都是人类，也都是成年人，面对灾难时一个成年人类能感动到何种地步、能做到何种地步，大体心里都是多少有个数的。
All of us are human beings and adults alike, who are more or less numberless in their hearts as to how much a grown-up can be moved and achieved in the face of disaster.
如果中国游戏人都有如此强大的凝聚力、公益心、理想主义，我不明白为什么中国游戏现在还是这副模样。
If Chinese players have such a strong sense of cohesion, public interest, idealism, I do not understand why the Chinese game is still like this.
当大众瞩目的事件消失的时候，那些凝聚力、公益心和理想都去哪了呢？想到这里，我看了看隔壁《这是我的战争》，基于灾难的制作理念可能是一样的，不过11bit竟然选择了用游戏卖钱这条路，而且还是距离灾难十几年后才开始制作，实在是觉悟不够，不足以让人铭记那场发生于1992年4月5日至1996年2月29日的不为国人所熟悉的小国里发生的惨烈人道灾难和大屠杀……当然了，在现在这个特殊时期，这样一款游戏出现，是百分百的正能量，来玩这款游戏的玩家，也能百分百体会到感动和正能量，最终传为一段佳话，这个过程没有任何可苛责的。
Where are the cohesive forces, the common good, and the ideals when the events that captured our attention vanish? Thinking of this, I looked next door at "It's My War," a disaster-based production philosophy that might be the same... but at this particular time, the game was made more than 10 years after the disaster.
大势之下，没有人会选择苛责。
Under the circumstances, no one will choose to be harsh.
