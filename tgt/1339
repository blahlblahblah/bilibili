”突然来袭的疫情，把餐饮行业打了个措手不及，相应供应链企业也难逃影响。
The sudden outbreak caught the restaurant industry by surprise and affected the corresponding supply chain companies.
但是，酱油企业似乎是个例外。
But soy sauce companies seem to be the exception.
2月开盘至今，海天味业（603288.SH）、中炬高新（600872.SH）和千禾味业（603027.SH）的涨幅分别为-0.37%，2.19%和6.26%。
Since the start of trading in February, the rises for Hetian flavor (603288.SH), Gao Xin (600872.SH) and Qianhe (603027.SH) have risen by -0.37%, 2.19% and 6.26% respectively.
市场的反应大抵因为“酱油是必需消费品，受疫情影响不大”。
The market response is largely because "soy sauce is an essential consumer product, not affected by the epidemic."
真的是这样吗？其实，餐饮渠道是酱油行业占比最大的销售渠道。
Really so? In fact, the restaurant channel is the soy sauce industry accounts for the largest sales channels.
我们的判断是，短期内餐馆停业对酱油行业的影响是把双刃剑。
Our judgment is that the short-term impact of restaurant closures on the soy sauce industry is a double-edged sword.
而是利是弊的决定性因素在于渠道结构。
But the decisive factor of pros and cons is the channel structure.
餐饮渠道销售骤降酱油销售渠道主要分为餐饮渠道、家庭渠道和食品加工渠道。
Sales channels of soy sauce are mainly divided into catering channels, household channels and food processing channels.
其中，餐饮渠道不仅占比最大（约45%），还稳步提升；家庭渠道和食品加工渠道分别占比约为30%和25%。
Not only do the catering channels account for the largest share (about 45 per cent), but they are also steadily increasing; the share of domestic and food processing channels is about 30 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively.
据中国产业信息网统计，餐饮渠道每千克食物调味品摄入量为家庭渠道的1.57倍。
According to the China Industry Information Network, the intake of food seasonings per kilogram of food channels is 1.57 times that of household channels.
以往，春节期间是餐饮行业的旺季。
Spring Festival used to be the peak season for the restaurant industry.
餐饮企业年前就已经备货，渠道经销商们也一样。
Food and beverage enterprises have been available years ago, channel dealers are the same.
今年疫情突然来袭，会使得餐饮企业和经销商手上都积压了存货。
This year's outbreak will leave food and beverage companies and dealers with a backlog of stocks.
随后，经销商从酱油企业拿货的意愿就会降低。
Subsequently, the dealer from the soy sauce enterprises will be less willing to take the goods.
餐饮渠道受冲击之下，首当其冲的就是酱油龙头——海天味业。
Food channels under the impact of the first is the soy sauce faucet - the taste of the sea.
海天以低端酱油占领市场，餐饮渠道销售占比高达六成，商超占三成，其他渠道只占一成。
Sky to low end soy sauce to occupy the market, catering channels account for 60% of sales, Shang Chao account for 30%, other channels for only 10%.
相比而言，中炬高新渠道结构更为均衡，餐饮，商超和其他渠道的比例为2.5：4：3.5。
Comparatively speaking, the high-tech channel structure is more balanced, catering, business and other channels ratio of 2.5: 4: 3.5.
千禾味业主要产品定位家庭消费，其餐饮渠道不足10%，受本次疫情影响最小。
The main products of Chihe flavor industry locates the household consumption, its dining channel is less than 10%, is affected by this epidemic situation least.
海天味业一直采用先款后货，以销定产的方式生产。
Sea-sky flavor industry has been using the first after goods, to sell the way of production.
海天会向经销商下达月度销售计划，并且以周订单的方式预付货款。
Sea Sky will issue monthly sales plans to dealers and pay in advance in the form of weekly orders.
但是，过年期间，经销商也会加大备货力度，2017和2018年年底预收账款占到当年销售总额的18%和19%，比平时高出约10个百分点。
Dealers will, however, increase their stock levels during the New Year, with advances at the end of 2017 and 2018 accounting for 18 per cent and 19 per cent of total sales for the year, about 10 percentage points higher than usual.
由此推测，海天2020年一季度的销售任务大概率可以完成。
This conjectures that the sea sky 2020 first quarter sales mission large probability can complete.
销售受影响会在二季度出现，因为经销商手里压了货没有消化掉，势必会影响继续订货。
Sales will be affected in the second quarter, because dealers have not been able to digest the goods, will inevitably affect the continuation of orders.
如果疫情3月底前可以得到控制，届时餐饮行业陆续恢复营业。
If the outbreak can be brought under control by the end of March, the catering industry will resume operations.
那么，疫情会影响海天餐饮渠道收入的时间大约为2个月。
Then, the outbreak will affect the sea-sky catering channel revenue for about two months.
参考海天2019年二季度营业额46.7亿元，假设餐饮渠道需求下降60%，那么公司2020年第二季度营业收入预计将下滑约16%左右，对全年影响约为4个百分点。
With a turnover of 4.67 billion yuan in the second quarter of 2019, assuming a 60% drop in catering demand, the company's operating revenue is expected to fall by about 16% in the second quarter of 2020, with an impact of about 4% for the whole year.

餐馆虽然停业了，但吃饭毕竟是刚需。
The restaurant was closed, but the meal was just needed.
疫情期间，人们宅在家里，做饭的需求跟着上升了。
During the epidemic, people stayed at home and the need to cook increased.
这就刺激了零售端酱油消费。
This stimulated the retail end soy sauce consumption.
千禾味业商超渠道占了约九成，家庭消费酱油增加意味着公司今年可能会实现超预期增长。
Chunghe's ultra-channels account for about 90%, and rising household consumption of soy sauce means the company is likely to grow faster than expected this year.
此外，千禾味业在湖北的销售占比不多，所以受疫情影响更不明显。
In addition, Qianhe flavor industry in Hubei account for a small proportion of sales, so affected by the epidemic is not obvious.
截止2019年前三季度，千禾味业中部地区的调味品销售收入只有0.44亿元，而渠道较为密集的西部地区贡献销售收入4.65亿元。
By the first three quarters of 2019, sales of condiments in the central part of the Qianhe flavor industry were only 44 million yuan, while those in the more densely-channel western region contributed 465 million yuan.
假设疫情带动家庭消费增长为20%，为期两个月。
Suppose the epidemic drives household consumption up by 20% over a two-month period.
那么，千禾味业今年营业额增加约4个百分点。
So Chihe's sales are up about four percentage points this year.
千禾味业的利润弹性还大于营业收入。
Chunhe's profit elasticity is greater than its operating income.
这是因为这家公司是以高端零添加酱油为拳头产品。
This is because the company is high-end zero added soy sauce products.
一直以来，高毛利更高的零添加酱油是带动千禾味业业绩增长的主动力。
For a long time, the high Maori higher zero soy sauce is the main driving force behind the growth of Chihe flavor industry.
2019年前三季度千禾味业调味品收入为7.8亿元，同比增长32.72%，其中零添加产品收入约4.51亿元，同比增长34.46%。
In the first three quarters of 2019, Chun Wo flavoring revenue was 780 million yuan, an increase of 32.72% year on year.
随着零添加产品占比继续扩大，千禾味业毛利率有望进一步提升。
As the proportion of zero added products continues to expand, Qianhe flavor industry gross margin is expected to further increase.
高估值神话会破灭吗？酱油个股一直饱受诟病的就是以海天味业为中心的“抱团”高估值问题。
Can the myth of high valuation be shattered? Soy sauce stocks have been criticized for the high valuation of the sea-sky taste industry as the center of the "clump."
以滚动市盈率来看，海天味业当前估值为55倍，中炬高新为45倍，千禾味业为49倍。
In terms of rolling P / E ratio, the current valuation of the sea-sky flavor industry 55 times, high 45 times the new torchlight, Chiho industry 49 times.
截止到去年三季报，三家公司的增速海天味业最高，约为22%。
The three companies posted the highest growth rate of about 22 percent as of last year's third quarter.
值得注意的是，三家公司对比2018年业绩增速已经出现大幅下滑。
It is worth noting that the three companies have seen a sharp decline in growth compared to 2018.
按照消费股普遍使用的PEG方法估值（市盈率估值与净利润增速比值，以1为界限，判断是否高估），已经处于明显高估状态。
According to the PEG method commonly used in consumer stocks (the ratio of P / E to net profit growth, measured as 1, is overstated), there is already a significant overestimation.
随着销售渠道越铺越密集，经过多年快速增长的酱油行业已经显露疲态。
The soy sauce industry, which has been growing rapidly for years, is already showing signs of fatigue as sales channels become more crowded.
不过，从沪股通持仓情况看，酱油股这种“抱团”高估值还没有松动迹象。
However, from the position of Shanghai stock market, soy sauce stocks this "clump" high valuation has not loosened.
2月3日以后，海天味业沪股通持仓市值占流通股股本比例从23.43%增加到23.48%。
After February 3, the market value of Shanghai-listed stocks rose from 23.43 per cent to 23.48 per cent.
中炬高新和千禾味业该比例增加的更为明显，分别增加了0.5和1.65个百分点。
The proportion of high-tech and thousand-grain flavor industry increased more obviously, by 0.5 percentage points and 1.65 percentage points respectively.
他们的持股数也相应有所增加。
Their holdings have increased accordingly.
可见，外资对酱油个股依然看好，未见减持迹象。
Visible, foreign capital to soy sauce stocks are still optimistic, no signs of reduction.
图片来源：Wind、界面新闻研究部由于现阶段对疫情影响的研判还不明确，外资持股逻辑偏重长期确定性，所以没有对海天味业进行业绩下修或减持的操作。
Due to the uncertainty of the current stage of the research on the impact of the epidemic, foreign ownership logic is focused on long-term certainty, so there is no performance of the sea-sky taste industry to revise or reduce operations.
一旦海天味业业绩增长不达预期，不排除外资短期内减持。
Once the sea-sky taste industry growth did not meet expectations, do not rule out foreign investment short-term reduction.
那时候，酱油股集体高估值的情况将受到挑战。
At that point, the collective high valuation of soy sauce stocks will be challenged.
