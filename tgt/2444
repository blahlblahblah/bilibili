深度和角度——这就是我们能做的。
Depth and angle - that's what we can do.

我希望这些行为能够影响其他人也加入“管闲事”的行动中来，这既是一个党员应该做的，也是一个军人应有的担当。
I hope these actions will influence others to get involved in "meddling," which is what a Party member should do and what a soldier should do.
口述 | 苏雨昕整理 | 周  洁这个春节过得和以往都不相同。
AT & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot
整个正月，我没能回家。
All month, I couldn't go home.
倒不是因为我去过武汉，而是因为我的母亲和妻子，都在医院工作，尤其是我的妻子，她是医院老年病科的护士长，还要给医院隔离病区的护士姊妹们做心理辅导，她还第一时间报名了援鄂医疗队，如果上海需要再派医护人员，她就该出征了。
Not because I had been to Wuhan, but because my mother and wife were working in the hospital, especially my wife, who was the head nurse in the geriatrics department of the hospital and counseled the nurses and sisters in the hospital quarantine area.
哦对了，我是上海武警的一名基层干部，我叫苏雨昕。
Oh yes, I am a basic cadre of Shanghai Armed Police. My name is Su Yuxin.
没能和家人团聚的日子，下了班以后，我也不想闲着，因为家里人都在医院，我格外关心疫情的发展，也希望自己能够做点什么。
I didn't want to be idle after work because my family were in the hospital. I was very concerned about the situation and wanted to do something about it.
我相信这不是我一个人的想法，终于，我找到了一个机会。
I believe that this is not my idea alone, and finally, I found a chance.
接力完成的爱心捐赠新冠肺炎疫情发生后，大多数人的目光都聚集到了武汉。
After the relay completed the heart donation New Crown Pneumonia outbreak, most people's eyes gathered in Wuhan.
不过，我对孝感的情况更为关心——我很久以前带过一个兵，他是孝感的，每次休假回来都给我们带孝感麻糖；我还记得他给我们科普，孝感之所以叫孝感，是因为东汉孝子董永卖身葬父、感天动地，孝字名不虚传。
However, I am more concerned about filial piety - I took a soldier a long time ago, he is filial, every time we come back from vacation to bring us filial feeling; I remember he gave us popular science, filial piety is called filial piety because the East Han Dynasty filial son Dong Yong sold himself to his father, touched the earth, and the filial name is well known.
湖北有我不少的战友，加上我家里人也是医院的，我想，总得做点什么吧？1月23日，小年夜，我在网上看到了一则求助信息——孝感第一人民医院缺物资，包括口罩、防护服等。
Hubei has many of my comrades, plus my family is also the hospital, I think, must do something about it? January 23, I saw a small online help message - filial piety First People's Hospital lack of supplies, including masks, protective clothing, etc.
实际上，那会儿市面上个人已经买不到口罩和防护服了，但我想到他们可能会需要的一种物资——成人尿不湿。
In fact, there were no masks or protective clothing available, but I thought of one of the things they might need: adult urine.
我的母亲曾经参与过非典的治疗，记得医护人员穿脱防护服非常费劲，而且长时间不吃不喝，也不能上厕所。
My mother, who had been treated for SARS, remembered how hard it was for paramedics to wear protective clothing and not to eat, drink or use the toilet for long periods of time.
我找遍全网，终于找到一家还能发货的商家（仓库就在孝感），买了十大包寄过去，等我朋友第二天想再支援一点的时候，发现所有商家都不发货了。
I looked all over the net, and finally found a still able to deliver goods (the warehouse in the sense of filial piety), bought 10 packages sent to the next day, when my friends want to support a little more, found that all businesses do not deliver.
不过，因为这批成人尿不湿，我得以跟医院负责物资的冯主任搭上线，得知他们很缺呼吸机，我和朋友们决定凑个份子，一起买一台。
But as the adults were not wet, I was able to hook up with Feng, the hospital's head of supplies, and learn that they were short of ventilators. My friends and I decided to chip in and buy one.
为此事，我们建了一个微信群“同呼吸共命运”。
For this, we have built a micro-group of "breathing together destiny."
此前我曾参加过渐冻症患者相关的公益活动，认识了一位做呼吸机代理的朋友，上海好点子商贸有限公司(惠民康恩)的薛洪艳薛姐，通过她，我了解到疫情发生后呼吸机卖得很紧俏，她手里的现货也不多了，我要，她同意帮我留一台无创呼吸机，而且成本价卖给我。
Through her, I learned that the ventilator was selling very fast after the outbreak and that she didn't have much in hand. I wanted, she agreed to keep a non-invasive ventilator for me at cost.
筹到钱之后，我问她能不能直接发到湖北，她意识到原来我是想做捐赠，她跟我说，她也想捐，但是她运不进去，如果我能把机器运过去，她愿意把手里的货都拿出来。
When I got the money, I asked her if she could send it directly to Hubei. She realized that I wanted to make a donation. She told me she wanted to donate too, but she couldn't get it in.
我很兴奋，这意味着我们也许可以救更多的人了。
I'm very excited, which means we may be able to save more people.
但兴奋过后，怎么运进去，成了我下一个要克服的难题。
But after the excitement, how to get in, has become my next challenge to overcome.
我联系了几家快递公司，他们均表示无法配送到武汉，中国邮政当时还能送进去，而且负责人愿意免费帮我们配送，但他表示，不能保证时效。
I contacted several courier companies that said they could not deliver to Wuhan, that China Post was able to do so and that the person in charge was willing to deliver it for free, but he said there was no guarantee of a time limit.
我想到了生活在武汉的战友，虽然他在武汉做志愿者，但当时武汉和孝感的公路已经切断了，他爱莫能助。
I think of his comrades living in Wuhan, although he did volunteer in Wuhan, but Wuhan and filial piety of the road has been cut off, he can not help.
幸好，我另一个武汉的战友给我介绍了湖北省应急管理厅的工作人员，这位工作人员提供了一个重要消息：2月7日，上海有一架中国船舶的直升机将运载应急物资飞往武汉。
Fortunately, another Wuhan comrade-in-arms introduced me to the staff of the Emergency Management Office of Hubei Province, who provided important information: On February 7, a helicopter from a Chinese ship in Shanghai flew to Wuhan with emergency supplies.
他还给了我物资运送负责人的联系方式，上海去武汉的难题就这样解决了。
He also gave me the contact information of the person in charge of the transportation of goods, so Shanghai to Wuhan's difficult problem was solved.
接下来怎么去孝感呢？正好我们中队里有孝感籍的战士，我跟他联系后，他介绍了他的舅舅给我们，他舅舅家正好就在医院的附近，就这样，物资的捐赠链条，终于在几天时间内被我们捋顺了。
After I contacted him, he introduced his uncle to us. His uncle's house was right near the hospital, so the chain of goods donation was finally smoothed by us in a few days.
跟薛姐汇报了这个情况后，她特别惊讶也特别开心，原本她准备了三台机器，后来让她的同事搜遍了所有的库存，又找到两台，凑了5台机器，当时她已经回到东北老家，由她同事转交给我们。
She was very surprised and very happy when she told her that she had prepared three machines, had her colleagues search all the stock, found two more and assembled five machines, then returned to her hometown in the Northeast, where she was handed over to us by her colleagues.
第二天晚上，我们把这5台机器送到直升机停靠点，那地方很大，那天下的雨有些大。
The next night, we took the five machines to the helicopter dock. It was a big place and it was raining a little bit.
我想我永远会记得给我们带路的扫地阿姨的背影，她没穿雨衣，知道我们是来送物资的，骑着电瓶车给我们带路，身上都湿了。
I think I'll always remember the back of the Aunt Sweeper who showed us the way. She didn't wear a raincoat. She knew we were here to deliver the supplies.
因为是精密仪器，我们的物资被放在了最外侧也因为那天下雨，直升机的运送延后了一天。
Because it was a precision instrument, our supplies were put on the outermost side and because of the rain that day, the helicopter delivery was delayed by one day.
2月8日，我们的呼吸机和其他物资一起到了武汉，武汉转运孝感的物资到了高速口以后，我们的呼吸机由战友的舅舅代表，直接捐到了医院。
On Feb. 8, our ventilator and other supplies together in Wuhan, Wuhan transfer filial piety materials to the high-speed mouth, our breathing machine was represented by his uncle, directly donated to the hospital.
后来我得知，当时医院只有6台呼吸机，但医院里有20多位重症病人，我们捐助的呼吸机可以说是恰逢其时，不仅令更多重症病人能够多拥有活下来的可能，医院的医生们也松了一口气。
I was later told that the hospital had only six ventilators, but that there were more than 20 critically ill patients in the hospital. The ventilator we donated was at the right time, not only to give more seriously ill patients a chance to survive, but also to relieve the doctors at the hospital.
在呼吸机的捐赠过程中，其实大部分人我都没有见过面，但疫情面前，我们每个人都愿意倾其所有作出自己的努力。
In the course of donating the ventilator, I have never met most of the people, but in the face of the epidemic, each of us is willing to devote all our efforts to it.
其实我也想过放弃，但这么多跟我一起努力的人“同呼吸共命运”，终于让这件事成为可能，而我们实实在在地捐助，也终于给到孝感的医生和病人支撑下去的信心。
In fact, I also want to give up, but so many people with me "breathing together" finally made it possible, and we made a real contribution, and finally gave filial doctors and patients to sustain the confidence.
这件事成功后，给了我们很大的信心。
The success of this event gave us a great deal of confidence.
得知新冠肺炎的患者会产生很多浓痰，我们原班人马又开始了新一轮的努力——这两天，薛姐正在联系国外的一种比较新型的吸痰机，这种机器原本也是应用于渐冻症患者，对于需要吸痰的患者或许可以起到作用；我和朋友则刚跟金银潭医院连上线，如果对接好需求，这批物资也将尽快成行。
Knowing that the patients with pneumonia would produce a lot of sputum, we started a new round of efforts. Over the past two days, Xue was contacting a newer type of spittoon that was also used in patients with acrophobia and might be useful for patients needing phlegm. My friends and I had just been connected to Gold and Silver Pool Hospital.
部队里的“管闲事儿大王”疫情期间，医疗资源真的挺紧张的。
During the "meddling king" epidemic in the army, medical resources were really tight.
我有心理咨询师的职业资格，所以在部队也会到基层去讲讲课，做些心理疏导。
I have the professional qualifications of a counselor, so in the army will also go to the grass-roots lectures, some psychological counseling.
有一天我下去时，发现我们有个战士的心理状态很不对，我对此比较敏感，于是进一步了解了他的情况。
One day when I came down, I found that one of our fighters was in a very bad state of mind. I was sensitive about it and got to know more about him.
问了以后得知，这位战士的母亲确诊得了比较严重的血液疾病，但当地没有能力确诊，更别说医治了。
When asked, the soldier's mother was diagnosed with a more serious blood disease, but there was no local capacity for diagnosis, let alone treatment.
战士的老家在重庆的云阳县，当地医疗力量比较薄弱，正好我家里的医生比较多，我就让他不要急，先把病情报告发给我，我来问问。
Warrior's hometown in Chongqing Yunyang County, the local medical forces are weak, just my family doctor more, I told him not to hurry, first sent me the disease report, let me ask.
我的小姨是血液科的专家，我发给她看了以后，她跟我说大概率是再生性障碍贫血，这个病很凶险，相当于你的骨髓罢工了，不再制造新鲜的血液了，需要赶紧治疗。
My aunt is a blood specialist, I sent her, she told me that the high probability is regenerative anemia, this disease is very dangerous, your bone marrow strike, no longer produce fresh blood, need to be treated immediately.
当地医院显然不具备救治能力，一个它技术不够，另外一个它没有血。
The local hospital obviously did not have the ability to treat, one it was technically inadequate, the other it had no blood.
但这是一条生命啊，没有山穷水尽前，怎么能放弃呢？后来，我们找到云阳和重庆中间的万州，万州有个三峡中心医院，经过争取后，对方医院同意接收我们战士的母亲。
Later, we found Wanzhou in the middle of Yunyang and Chongqing, and there is a Three Gorges Central Hospital in Wanzhou, after which the other hospital agreed to accept the mothers of our fighters.
由于我们战士是特困家庭，但这个病需要很多钱，我们又号召中队的党员捐款，先期筹集了一万多元，目前还在帮助他申请一些其他的救济项目。
As we are a special hardship case, but the disease requires a lot of money, we also called on the members of the squadron to donate, raised more than 10,000 yuan in advance, and are currently helping him to apply for other relief projects.
我一直认为，很多心理问题的背后是有一个实际问题存在的，只有把实际问题解决，心理问题才能迎刃而解。
I always think that there is a real problem behind many psychological problems. Only by solving the practical problems can the psychological problems be solved.
当然，不是每次我们都能解决背后的实际问题，但对我来说，努力尝试过才能不愧于心。
Of course, not every time we can solve the real problems behind us, but for me, it's worth trying.
不知道为什么，可能因为我从小就学钢琴、学架子鼓什么的，比较感性，碰到这些事儿，让我知道了，我就没法不去管，因为这，我们单位不少人都说我是“管闲事大王”，其实我也不是爱管闲事，我就是看到别人需要帮助，自己不出力不舒服。
I do not know why, perhaps because I was young learning piano, learning more emotional drum structure, such things, let me know, I can not ignore, because many people say I am "meddlesome king," in fact, I am not nosy, I just see others need help, do not contribute uncomfortable.
前段时间我们同事的家属从湖北来看他，没想到刚来就出现了疫情，于是家属进入医学隔离，出不了门回不了家，情绪很不好，还跟同事闹别扭。
Some time ago, our colleagues' families came to see him from Hubei, did not expect that the outbreak occurred, so the family members into medical isolation, can not go home, mood is very bad, and angry with colleagues.
我知道以后，趁着隔离期结束，带了一些零食去看望孩子，还带着一盏老鼠灯，这是我每年元宵都会给我闺女准备的玩具。
I knew I would take some snacks with me to see my children and a mouse light at the end of the quarantine period. It was a toy that I would prepare for my girl every year.
我一直希望我能够维护所有人对于美好的信任和向往，我的这些行为能够影响其他人也加入“管闲事”的行动中来，这既是一个党员应该做的，也是一个军人应有的担当。
I have always hoped that I would be able to maintain the good faith and desire of all, and that my actions would influence others to join in the "meddling," which is what a Party member should do and a soldier should do.
