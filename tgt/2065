刚刚过去的周末对于意大利而言无疑是一场公共安全危机的从天而降，境内确诊病例从2月20日的寥寥数人激增至2月23日的152人，病亡人数已增至3名，2月24日意大利确诊和死亡人数更分别攀升至219人和5人。
The past weekend has undoubtedly been a crisis of public safety for Italy, with the number of confirmed cases surging from a few on February 20 to 152 on February 23, the number of sick and wounded has risen to three, and the number of confirmed cases and deaths in Italy climbed to 219 and 5, respectively, on 24 February.
意大利总理孔特表示，其对病例数量“爆炸式激增”感到震惊，并呼吁意大利各政治力量摒弃前嫌共同应对紧急情况。
Italian Prime Minister Matteo Conte said he was shocked by the "explosive surge" in the number of cases and called on Italy's political forces to overcome past grievances and work together to address the emergency.
意大利此次病例数目的爆炸式增长，主要源于发生于该国北部的两起聚集性传染时间，即1月份自中国回国的意大利公民，在观察期未出现症状后外出与亲友聚餐，造成大规模传播。
The explosive increase in the number of cases in Italy is mainly due to the mass spread of two cases of concentrated infection in the north of the country, namely Italian citizens who returned from China in January and went out to dine with relatives and friends after a period of observation without symptoms.
同时，意大利《共和报》报道称，一名事后被确诊的男子曾在意大利北部多个地区参加足球比赛和马拉松等活动，其作为“超级传播者”的风险极高。
Meanwhile, the Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported that a man who had been later diagnosed with soccer matches and marathons in various parts of northern Italy was at high risk as a "super-communicator."
因此，意大利疫情的突然爆发，根本上还是由于病毒的潜伏期长、症状辨别难度高，使归国人员防控中出现疏忽状况，加之此前病例人数较少令意大利及整个欧洲并未进行高度戒备，给病毒扩散带来了可乘之机。
Thus, the outbreak of an outbreak in Italy is essentially due to the long latency of the virus, the difficulty of identifying symptoms, and the neglect in the control of returnees, combined with the fact that the previous low number of cases left Italy and Europe as a whole on high alert, creating opportunities for the spread of the virus.
然而，意大利的大面积爆发已经给北方地区造成严重影响，此次的两个感染集中爆发地分别位于米兰和威尼斯两座名城附近，威尼托大区和伦巴第大区已经宣布了相应的封锁措施，预计11个市镇的5万居民将被限制出入流动，并派出警力到主要交通要道上进行巡逻。
However, widespread outbreaks in Italy have had a severe impact in the north, with two concentrated outbreaks in Milan and Venice, where closures have been announced in the Veneto and Lombardy regions. It is expected that 50,000 residents of 11 municipalities will be restricted in their movement and police will be deployed to patrol the main roads.
威尼斯一年一度的狂欢节及数场意大利足球甲级联赛比赛被迫叫停，学校、博物馆、歌剧院等公共设施被迫关闭，部分地区出现对生活必需品和防疫物资的恐慌性抢购。
Venice's annual carnival and several Italian football league games were halted, schools, museums, opera houses and other public facilities were closed, and panic buying of necessities and epidemic prevention materials occurred in some areas.
可以预见的是，意大利经济将在近期受到一定的冲击。
Predictably, Italy's economy will be hit hard in the near future.
长期以来，意大利的经济重心即在北部的威尼托和伦巴第地区，占到意大利经济总量的1/3，也是汽车、航空等高端制造业以及服装、艺术设计等时尚产业的聚集地，同时米兰和威尼斯也是对游客有着很大吸引力的旅游城市，此次被迫中止的威尼斯狂欢节每年都将吸引大量游客，旅游业亦贡献了意大利国内生产总值的6%。
Italy's long-standing economic center of gravity, in the northern regions of Veneto and Lombardy, accounts for one-third of Italy's economy. It is also home to high-end manufacturing such as automobiles and aviation, as well as fashion industries such as clothing and art design.
同时，意大利北部与法国东部及瑞士提契诺州和格劳宾登州接壤，产业链联系紧密，每年约6.8万人从意大利进入瑞士工作。
At the same time, the northern part of Italy borders eastern France and the cantons of Ticino and Graubenden, Switzerland, with closely linked industrial chains, with some 68,000 people entering Switzerland from Italy each year to work.
意大利政府的管控措施将广泛影响该地区制造业、服务业以及跨境商贸活动，使得本已陷入低迷状态的意大利经济雪上加霜。
Italian government controls will affect manufacturing, services and cross-border commerce across the region, adding to Italy's already sluggish economy.
2019年第四季度意大利经济出现0.3%的萎缩，全年增长率仅为0.2%，远远低于欧元区1.2%的水平。
Italy's economy contracted by 0.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2019, growing by only 0.2 per cent for the year as a whole, well below the 1.2 per cent euro area.
市场亦对意大利经济前景表示悲观，意大利富时MIB股指在24日大幅下跌4.6%，是自2016年6月以来的单日最大跌幅。
Markets were also pessimistic about Italy's economic outlook, with FTSE MI B shares down 4.6% on the 24th, the biggest one-day drop since June 2016.
进一步看，意大利疫情的爆发很可能向欧洲扩散，并且对整个欧洲经济产生影响。
Looking further, the outbreak in Italy is likely to spread to Europe, with implications for the entire European economy.
由于欧洲26个国家实行无相互边境检查的申根区制度，给跨国人员、货物、车辆流动的监管与追踪带来困难，同时如意大利此次由于隔离期结束后发病传染的预防难度极大，使得各国均面临疫情突然“爆炸式增长”的风险，若这种人员和物流的隔离以及紧急防控措施的大范围采用，恐怕对各行各业均将造成显著冲击，内需和外贸的下降亦不可避免。
The introduction of the Schengen area system in 26 European countries without cross-border controls makes it difficult to monitor and track the movement of people, goods, and vehicles across borders. Italy faces the risk of a sudden "explosion" of disease as a result of the end of the quarantine period.
同时，口罩等必须物资在欧洲亦出现紧缺状况，令全民防疫面临物质挑战。
Meanwhile, shortages of essential supplies such as masks have emerged in Europe, posing material challenges to the population.
法国卫生部长奥利维尔·韦兰表示，欧洲国家应共同讨论如何应对意大利的疫情增长，法国将“保持密切关注”。
French Health Minister Olivier Whelan said European countries should discuss how to deal with Italy's growing epidemic and that France would "keep a close watch."
当前，包括意大利在内的一些国家已经有些风声鹤唳。
At present, some countries, including Italy, are jittery.
意大利极右翼政党党首萨尔维尼利用疫情的恐慌，推动国内反移民情绪上升，并对政府的应对态度与措施报以质疑和反对之声，呼吁临时暂停《申根协定》以应对疫情。
The leader of Italy's far-right party, Salvigny, took advantage of the scare to boost anti-immigrant sentiment at home, and challenged and objected to the government's response, calling for a temporary suspension of the Schengen Agreement to deal with the outbreak.
奥地利则在23日晚间因一班奥意之间的火车出现发热者，而一度暂停了运营。
Austria on the night of 23 because of a train between Austria and Italy fever, and temporarily suspended the operation.
但从欧盟反映来看，欧洲国家并不希望将疫情的恐慌放大扩散，甚至影响到欧盟内正常的人员货物流动。
But, according to the EU, European countries do not want the panic to spread, or even affect the normal flow of people and goods within the EU.
意大利前总理、欧盟委员会经济金融委员真蒂罗尼表示，我们对疫情的担忧很正常，但不必恐慌，欧盟也对意大利政府的各项措施充满信心。
'Our concerns about the outbreak are normal, but don't panic, 'said Jean Tiloni, a former Italian prime minister and European Commission economic and financial commissioner.
欧盟各国卫生部门也在24日召开电话会议讨论疫情形势防控，但意大利政府和欧盟方面均不支持暂停申根制度，显示欧洲整体在疫情面前仍然要坚守其经济社会理念不被恐慌所绑架。
The European Union health departments also held a conference call on the 24th to discuss the situation control, but the Italian Government and the European Union did not support the suspension of the Schengen system, showing that the European community as a whole still has to adhere to its economic and social philosophy in the face of the epidemic.
从此次意大利的疫情可以看出，重大公共卫生事件在全球化的时代里是全人类共同面对的挑战，几乎不可能在此独善其身。
As the Italian epidemic shows, major public health events are a common challenge to all humanity in an era of globalization, and it is almost impossible to isolate themselves from them.
而各国在采取有效措施积极防控的同时，也应坚定信心，秉持自由开放的理念和相互合作的诚意，并对借疫情散播恐慌甚至种族主义进行坚决抵制，才是为全人类健康福祉负责的做法。
While taking effective measures for active prevention and control, all countries should also firmly believe that it is responsible for the health and well-being of all mankind to adhere to the concept of freedom and openness and the sincerity of mutual cooperation, and to resolutely resist the spread of fear and even racism due to the epidemic.
