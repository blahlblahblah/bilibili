Lily商务时装2020春夏上海时装周发布会 图片来源：Lily商务时装记者 ：楼婍沁编辑 ：许悦“ 作为时尚界的重要行业之一，模特业也毫无例外地在上下游合作伙伴均被新冠疫情重创时，受到冲击。
http: / / www.shinhuang.com / shanghai fashion week 2020 http: / / www.youtheme.cn www.youtheme.cn Zhang Yue As one of the most important industries in fashion, the modeling industry has always been hit hard by the new crown epidemic among its upstream and downstream partners.
”新冠疫情也毫无例外地影响着模特界的生态。
The new crown has affected modelling ecology without exception.
不管是模特本人，还是他们背后的经纪人与经纪公司，都正面临前所未有的困难和挑战。
Both the models themselves, as well as the brokers and brokers behind them, are facing unprecedented difficulties and challenges.
许靖是上海龙腾精英旗下的一名女模特。
Xu Jing is a female model under the banner of Shanghai Longten elite.
因为刚从欧洲结束时装周行程回到上海，她目前正处在居家隔离中。
Having just returned to Shanghai from a fashion week in Europe, she is now in quarantine at home.
14天内，她无法参与任何工作，包括针对未来工作的现场面试。
For 14 days, she was unable to take part in any work, including on-site interviews for future work.
而这是大多数这几天陆续结束海外工作回国的模特们都正经历着的。
And that's what most models are going through these days as they come home from overseas work.
“而且我还是比较幸运的。
"" And I'm lucky.
”许靖说。
"said Xu Jing.
由于在巴黎时装周的工作结束后，和朋友一起去葡萄牙旅游了几天才回国，许靖正好被上海海关“14天内曾前往疫情重点地区意大利”的集中隔离条件排除在外，因此得以进行14天的居家隔离。
After a few days of traveling back to Portugal with friends after a fashion week in Paris, Xu Jing was shut out by the Shanghai customs's "intensive quarantine conditions, which allowed for 14 days of isolation.
而不少在米兰时装周或是巴黎时装周工作结束后直接回国的模特就不得不接受前往指定酒店集中隔离的安排。
Many models who return home directly after Milan Fashion Week or Paris Fashion Week have had to go to designated hotels for centralized segregation.
事实上，这部分正在隔离的模特都可算作行业中比较幸运的一部分，因为至少他们在国内疫情爆发的近两个月时间中仍保证了相对饱和的工作量。
In fact, this segment of the model population that is being quarantined can be considered a lucky part of the industry, because at least they have been able to maintain a relatively saturated workload for almost two months of the outbreak.
以许靖为例，由于在1月中下旬参加巴黎高定时装周已出国，她没有遇到国内疫情爆发后部分国家对中国公民签证停发、航班取消等限制，因此顺利参加了纽约、伦敦、米兰、巴黎2020秋冬季时装周的走秀工作。
Xu Jing, for example, went abroad for the High Ding Fashion Week in Paris in the second half of January. She did not encounter restrictions on visa suspension and flight cancellation for Chinese citizens in some countries after the outbreak of the domestic epidemic.
一季四站下来走了超过20场秀。
More than 20 shows come down four times a season.
部分模特在四大时装周的走秀行程结束后，还会飞往纽约等城市投入繁忙的商业拍摄，工作日程几乎满档。
Some models will fly to New York and other cities for busy commercial filming at the end of the show's four major fashion weeks, almost on a full schedule.
不过，她提到，不确定是否是因为新冠疫情爆发，她和相识的一些同在征战国际时装周的模特讨论后，都觉得这一季的工作机变少，尤其是在米兰和巴黎时装周期间，至少面试机会变少了。
However, she said she wasn't sure if it was the outbreak of the new crown, and that she and some of her acquaintances who had been modeling for International Fashion Week felt the season had fewer machines, especially during Milan and Paris Fashion Week, at least with fewer interview opportunities.
“我上一季（2020春夏季）因为签证问题，只走了纽约和巴黎时装周的秀，但也走了快20场，和这一季走四站差不多。
"I only went to New York and Paris Fashion Week last season (spring / summer 2020) because of visa problems, but I also went for nearly 20 shows, about the same as four stops this season.
”Giorgio Armani米兰2020秋冬大秀前工作人员派发口罩界面时尚曾在此前做过报道，受新冠疫情影响，米兰时装周草草收场，包括Giorgio Armani在内的品牌临时决定将现场走秀改为云录制。
Giorgio Armani Milan 2020 autumn and winter show staff distribution mask interface fashion has been previously reported, due to the new fashion season, Milan fashion week, including Giorgio Armani temporary decided to change the live show to cloud recording.
而本应在5月陆续展开的品牌度假系列大秀也都纷纷宣布取消。
And the brand holiday series, which was due to begin in May, has been canceled.
随着疫情进一步在全球范围内扩散、加剧，除了走秀，拍摄工作可以想见也势必将受到影响。
As the epidemic spreads and intensifies around the world, the filming process can be expected to suffer as well as the show.
许靖也证实了这一点。
Xu Jing also confirmed this.
她认识的不少原先准备在海外继续工作的模特，最近也开始陆续提前回国。
Many of the models she knew who were planning to continue working overseas have recently started returning home earlier.
因为海外新冠疫情爆发后，当地的工作开始出现取消、延迟等情况。
Due to the outbreak of the new crown overseas, local work began to be cancelled, delayed and so on.
而且，很多模特也担心自己一直呆在国外的健康安全问题。
Moreover, many models worry about their health and safety while staying abroad.
只是现在想回国不那么容易，机票不好买不说，即使能买到票，也都是用高昂的价格买一组需要中转30小时以上的机票，而等到到了机场还需要配合相关部门完成严格的边境检疫程序。
But now it is not easy to return home, tickets are not easy to buy, even if you can buy a set of tickets with a high price transit 30 hours or more, until the airport has to cooperate with the relevant departments to complete the strict border quarantine procedures.
2019秋冬季上海时装周秀场更多没能在春节前后出国工作的模特则从春节假期开始就再没有开过工。
The Shanghai Fashion Week Show in the autumn and winter of 2019 has seen more models who fail to work abroad before and after the Spring Festival holiday.
上海龙腾精英的男模刘俊就是其中之一。
Shanghai Longten elite male model Liu Jun is one of them.
他告诉界面时尚记者，虽然说不上具体的数字，但他感到工作量明显减少，尤其是考虑到春节假期结束后国内模特行业本该进入忙季了。
He told Interface fashion reporters that while he couldn't say exactly how many, he felt the workload was falling, especially given that the domestic modeling industry was supposed to be in a busy season after the Spring Festival.
通常情况下，模特在过完春节假期后都会从家乡返回工作常驻地，开始为国内时装周进行包括样册拍摄、模卡更新、试装面试等准备工作；到三月中旬，便会投入国内时装周的品牌走秀工作，部分模特在时装周走秀工作结束后，还会开始进入忙碌的商业广告拍摄日程。
Models usually return to work from home after the Spring Festival and begin preparations for the national fashion week, which includes sample, model and fitting interviews. By mid-March, some models will be working on the national fashion week brand show, and some will start their busy commercial schedules after the fashion week show.
“但今年影响非常大，工作量至少对半砍，目前我们主要承接的都是拍摄类的工作，走秀这一块的业务减少很明显。
"But this year the impact is very large, the workload at least half cut, at present we are mainly engaged in filming type of work, show this part of the business decline is very obvious.
”上海龙腾精英公司模特经纪人陈虹锦说。
"Shanghai Longten elite company model agent Chen Hongjin said.
上海时装周作为国内最重要的时装发布活动之一，曾是国内模特们重要的工作机会。
Shanghai Fashion Week, as one of the most important fashion events in China, has been an important job opportunity for Chinese models.
但出于疫情防控的需要，2020秋冬季上海时装周已在此前宣布延期，并转为与天猫合作，进行线上“云发布”。
But in the fall and winter of 2020, Shanghai Fashion Week had been postponed due to the need for epidemic prevention and control.
这意味着，虽然品牌们仍出于走秀等展示需要，对于模特有需求，但需求不会如之前那么大，而且对于模特的技能要求也变得更多元——除了会走秀，品牌可能还会对模特提出更多能适应直播等新传播方式的动态展示要求。
This means that while brands are still in demand for showbiz, models are in demand, but demand is not as great as before, and the skills requirements for models have become more diverse - in addition to the show, the brand may also offer models more dynamic display requirements to adapt to new modes of transmission, such as live broadcasting.
“因为品牌方有这样的要求，我们肯定要多尝试挖掘和培养模特更多的可能性。
"Because the brand has such a requirement, we must definitely try to dig more and develop more possibilities for models.
”火石文化海外部总监Lizzie在接受界面时尚采访时表示。
"Lizzie, managing director of flint culture, said in a fashion interview with the interface.
陈虹锦及Lizzie都提到此次疫情也或多或少影响了模特经纪人及经纪公司的工作。
Both Chen and Lizzie note that the epidemic has also affected the work of model brokers and brokerage firms to a greater or lesser extent.
除了诸如调整改变招募及培养标准之类更为长期的影响，她们迫在眼前需要完成的工作的是，如何远程与所带的模特保持沟通，确保他们安全、健康，并且能始终维持较好的外形状态。
In addition to longer-term effects such as changes in recruitment and development standards, the immediate task they face is how to communicate remotely with their models to ensure that they are safe, healthy and in good shape at all times.
Lizzie所在的公司甚至为模特们寄去了口罩等防护用品。
Lizzie's company even sent models protective gear, such as masks.
图片来源；broadcast播模特们工作量减少的另一个重要原因正是，他们中的许多人目前还无法返回工作常驻地。
Another important reason for the reduced workload of models is that many of them are currently unable to return to their places of permanent work.
有的是因为家乡防疫管控措施限制了出行，更多人，特别是兼职的大学生模特，则是因为学校未开学，宿舍没开放，而无处可住。
In some cases, travel has been restricted by measures to control epidemic prevention in their home communities, and many more, especially part-time university model students, have no place to live because their schools are not open and their dormitories are not open.
“现阶段主要考虑的肯定是安全，所以我们会建议模特不要急着回来。
"The main consideration at this stage is definitely safety, so we would advise the model not to rush back.
但这也使我们没法探班、跟拍、看模特的状态。
But it also makes it impossible for us to visit, take pictures, or watch models.
”陈虹锦直言，原本每次春节期间，她都会担心模特们在假期回来复工后的状态问题，而现在因为疫情，假期时间突然变得更长，她的担心更大，“真是特别怕模特发胖，因为大多数模特多吃不动还是会胖的。
Chen Hong Jin bluntly said that she used to worry about models returning to work during the Spring Festival, but now the holidays have suddenly gotten longer because of the epidemic.
”毕竟能留给模特们减肥塑形的时间已经不多了。
After all, there isn't much time left for models to lose weight.
Lizzie表示，她已明显感到这段时间，品牌客户已陆续复工，平面拍摄和电商直播间之类的工作都已经多了起来。
Ms. Lizzie says she already has a clear sense that branded customers have been returning to work and that more work has been done on print and commercial studios.
这也是为什么经纪公司们这一段时间都忙着维护模特们的社交账号。
That's why brokerage firms have been busy trying to maintain models' social accounts for a while.
Lizzie和陈虹锦就都将春节复工后的一部分时间分配给了更精细地规划和塑造模特的网络形象。
Both Lizzie and Chen Hongjin have allocated part of their Spring Festival holiday back to work to more elaborate planning and modelling of the model's online image.
“实际上，疫情没有发生的时候，我们也开始接到客户对于偏流量型模特的询问了。
"In fact, when the epidemic did not occur, we were beginning to get inquiries from customers about off-stream models," he said.
”陈虹锦说。
"said Chen Hong Jin.
