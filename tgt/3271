1.At the end of the movie Titanic, heroine Rose struggles to swim to another floating plank after her lover Jack sinks in the cold water.
木板上，是一位身体已然僵冷的船员。
On the plank was an already stiff seaman.
萝丝从他身上取下了一枚哨子，奋力吹响。
Rose took a whistle from him and blew as hard as she could.
哨音冲破了死寂，寻找幸存者的船只掉转船头，萝丝获救。
The whistle broke through the silence. The ship looking for survivors turned the bow and Rose was rescued.
萝丝很幸运，不仅仅是因为她遇到了甘愿用生命来保护她的杰克，也因为她恰好找到了一枚救命的哨子。
Rose was lucky not only because she had met Jack, who was willing to defend her with her life, but also because she had just found a life-saving whistle.
如果《泰坦尼克号》的故事早发生30年，萝丝大概很难能幸免于难。
Had the story of Titanic happened 30 years earlier, Rose probably would not have been spared.
因为只有这种问世于1882年的现代哨子才有如此响亮的声音，能把求救信号传送得足够远。
For it was only this modern whistle, born in 1882, that had such a resounding sound that it carried the distress signal far enough.
杰克和萝丝的爱情故事是虚构的，但“泰坦尼克”号的700余名幸存者中，确实有人靠吹哨获救。
The love story between Jack and Rose is fictional, but of the more than 700 Titanic survivors, some were rescued by whistling.
这个救命的哨子，乃是“泰坦尼克”号特别定制，其制造商英国J·哈德森公司，正是现代哨子的发明者。
The whistle that saved lives was specially made for the Titanic, and its manufacturer, J. Hudson of Great Britain, was the inventor of the modern whistle.
泰坦尼克号使用的哨子的复刻版哨子虽然有数千年的历史，但从前的哨子要么音量低，要么吹起来费力，通常只能作为简单的乐器和小孩子的玩具。
Duplicate whistles used by the Titanic, though thousands of years old, were either low-pitched or hard to blow, and were often used only as simple musical instruments and children's toys.
哈德森公司的最大创新，是给哨子内置了一颗小球，也就是哨核。
Hudson's biggest innovation is to give the whistle built-in a small ball, that is, the whistle.
有了哨核，吹哨者不费太大力气，就能让哨子的声音传到一英里之远[1]。
With a sentry, it takes little effort for a whistler to reach a mile or so; 1; 1; 1; 93; and
哈德森公司生产的首批现代警用哨“埃可米哨”自此问世，哈德森公司把它推销给伦敦警局，警方如获至宝，订单如雪片般飞来。
Hudson's first modern police sentry, the Ekomi Sentry, came out and Hudson marketed it to the LPD, where orders snowed in.
很快，哈德森公司成了当时世界上最大的哨子制造商，其客户包括英国各地警察局、拥有“泰坦尼克”号的白星航线，乃至诺曼底登陆的美军101空降师。
Hudson soon became the world's largest whistle-maker, with clients ranging from police stations across the UK, white star routes with the Titanic to the US Army's 101 Airborne Division landing in Normandy.
埃可米哨的统治地位延续了百年，直到上世纪80年代末，哨子行业迎来了颠覆者。
Ekomi's reign lasted for a hundred years, until the end of the 1980s, when the whistle industry was overthrown.
按惯例，颠覆者都来自本行业之外。
By convention, those who topple come from outside the industry.
此人名叫福克斯克罗夫特，是一位业余篮球裁判，常年用哨，但苦于哨子总出毛病，尤其是哨核，一不留神会堵住声音。
Fox Croft, an amateur basketball referee, used the whistle all year round, but he was always having trouble whistling, especially at the post.
一次国际比赛，他本想吹罚球员犯规，结果哨核又堵了，发出的哨音谁都听不见。
He tried to foul a player in an international match, but the whistle was again blocked and no one could hear him.
犯规没有被及时阻止，球员和球迷情绪激动，爆发了冲突，场上场下打成一团。
The foul was not stopped in time, the players and fans were excited, a clash broke out, and the field was huddled.
蒙冤挨揍的福克斯克罗夫特躺在地板上，悲愤发誓：“如果我能活着回老家，一定要发明不用哨核的哨子。
Vicious Fox Krofft lay on the floor, vowing indignantly: "If I ever get back home alive, I must invent whistles that do not require a whistle.
[2]”Fox 40狐狸哨的创始人罗恩·福克斯克罗夫特回到加拿大，他拿出积蓄，找了一位设计师合伙人，花了三年时间，背了15万美元的债，研究出了无核哨，名为“狐狸哨”。
Ron Fox Croft, founder of Fox 40 Fox, returned to Canada. He took out his savings and found a partner with a designer. It took three years, $150,000 in debt, to develop a nuclear-free whistle, called Fox Watch.
1987年的泛太平洋运动会上，狐狸哨首次使用，一鸣惊人。
In 1987, at the Pan-Pacific Games, Fox Whistle was used for the first time with astonishing exploits.
狐狸哨没有哨核带来的麻烦，而且声音极具穿透力，不管体育场有多大、人群有多喧哗，哨音也清晰可闻。
The Fox did not have the hassle of a whistle, and it was very penetrating. No matter how big the stadium was and how noisy the crowd was, the whistle could be heard clearly.
狐狸哨哨子的主要功能，无外乎警告、维持秩序、发送信号，以及求生。
The main functions of the fox whistle are nothing more than warning, maintaining order, sending signals, and survival.
以此而论，能吹得响的哨子，当然是好哨子。
As such, whistles that blow loud are, of course, good whistles.
所以哨子厂商们也一直在“没有最响，只有更响”上拼命较劲。
So whistle manufacturers have also been "no loudest, only louder" on the desperate struggle.
世界上吹得最响的哨音，有吉尼斯世界纪录的官方认证，是在2004年创造的，哨音达到了125分贝。
The loudest whistle in the world, officially certified by Guinness World Records, was set in 2004, reaching 125 decibels.
但这项纪录只提及了吹哨者的姓名，并未公布哨子的品牌。
But the record only mentions the name of the whistler and does not reveal the brand.
哨子界至少有两家厂商都宣称自己是吹得最响的哨。
At least two whistleblower companies claim to be the loudest whistle.
一是风暴哨，二是Hyper哨。
One was the storm whistle, the other Hyper sentry.
风暴哨看上去很卡通，但音量惊人，声音可达120分贝以上。
The whistle looked cartoonish, but it was loud enough to be above 120 decibels.
这种哨子在户外爱好者中尤其受欢迎，因为它能全天候使用，在茂密的丛林里，甚至在最深50英尺的水中，它都能发出响亮的声音。
The whistle is especially popular with outdoor enthusiasts because it can be used all day long and makes a loud noise in the thick jungle, even in the deepest 50 feet of water.
Hyper哨则宣称，风暴哨只是“曾经的世界最响”。
Hyper said the whistle was "the loudest in the world ever."
他们拿出测试视频为证，称Hyper哨音量可达143分贝——超出了吉尼斯世界纪录。
They took out test videos, saying Hyper whistled up to 143 decibels - more than the Guinness World Record.
因为音量大，哨子还配了耳塞，保护吹哨者的听力。
Because the volume is high, the whistle is also equipped with earplugs to protect the whistler's hearing.
在测试者把自己吹聋之前，哨子音量的“军备竞赛”，可能永远不会停止。
The "arms race" in whistling volume may never stop before the tester blows itself deaf.
02.在现代哨子诞生前，哨子在东西方都已经有数千年的历史。
Before the modern whistle was born, it had a history of thousands of years in both East and West.
在西方，古希腊人出海，就在用哨子指挥船上奴隶划桨。
In the West, the ancient Greeks put to sea and used whistles to command the rowers of slaves on ships.
而在中国，新石器时代出土的单孔和三孔陶埙被视为哨子的鼻祖。
In China, unearthed single-hole and three-hole pottery Xun is regarded as the originator of the whistle.
宋金时期，陶瓷哨子在市井间已经十分普遍，主要是作为孩童的玩具[4]。
Ceramics whistles were common in the Song Dynasty, mainly as children's toys and # 91; 4 & # 93; # 93;
遥想“国足上古大神”高俅蹴鞠时，裁判（当时称为“都部署校正”和“杜司”）大概并不是用哨子来执法的。
On the day of the visit, the referee on the Qiu (both deployed corrections and Du Shi) probably did not use whistles to enforce the law.
到了今天，除了警哨、裁判哨这类“执法”哨子，也仍有纯粹用于娱乐的哨子。
Today, in addition to the guard, referee and other such "law enforcement" whistle, there are still purely for entertainment whistle.
其中一大类，便是宠物哨。
One of the big categories is pet sentries.
宠物哨不以“吹得响”为指标。
Pet whistle is not an indicator of "blowing loudly."
有的要声音婉转，比如训画眉鸟唱歌的画眉哨；有的甚至故意做成无声哨，比如“静音犬哨”。
Some want a gentle voice, like the thrush of a thrush singing to a thrush; some even deliberately make a silent whistle, such as a "silent dog whistle."
这种训犬用的哨子，发出的声音是只有动物能听到的超声波，人耳只能听到轻微的嘶声。
This dog-training whistle makes an ultrasonic sound that only animals can hear. The human ear can only hear a slight hiss.
画眉哨口哨的功能还取决于使用它的人。
The function of the eyebrow whistle also depends on the person who uses it.
一只普通的口哨，在我们手中，只能用来吹出声音，但在顶级黑客手中，口哨能变成入侵电话网络的神器。
An ordinary whistle, in our hands, can only be used to blow out sounds, but in the hands of top hackers, whistles can become the weapon of an intruding telephone network.
这可能是最著名的早期黑客传奇。
This is probably the most famous early hacker saga.
上世纪中期，美国的电话系统还在使用交换机。
In the middle of the last century, the telephone system in the United States was switched on.
1958年，盲人黑客乔·恩格雷西亚发现，2600赫兹频率的口哨声可以骗过交换机，让交换机认为通话已经中断，打电话的人便可以享受免费打电话的待遇。
In 1958, blind hacker Joe Engrescia discovered that a whistle of 2,600 hertz could trick an exchange into thinking that a call had been disconnected, giving callers the benefit of a free call.
到了70年代，这项技术被黑客约翰·德雷珀发扬光大。
By the 1970s, the technology had been developed by hacker John Draper.
他发现，自己买麦片时得到的一只赠品玩具口哨，恰好是2600赫兹频率。
He found that he got a toy whistle for his cereal that happened to be 2600 hertz.
用这只塑料口哨，他打了2年多免费电话。
Using this plastic whistle, he made a free phone call for more than two years.
之后，德雷珀又发明了专门入侵电话系统的“蓝盒子”，入侵全国电话系统宛如进自家后院，最令他念念不忘的丰功伟绩，是他有一次把电话拨到了时任美国总统尼克松的办公室，向总统报告说，“西海岸缺卫生纸”[5]。
Mr Draper then invented the "blue box" of intrusive telephone systems, a feat he remembered best when he dialed then-President Richard Nixon's office to report to the president that "the West Coast lacks toilet paper" & # 91; 5 & # 93; & # 39;
德雷珀不是第一个黑客，但却是第一个被冠以“黑客”称号的人，他的经历影响了包括苹果创始人沃兹和乔布斯在内的许多人。
Mr Draper was not the first hacker, but was the first to be dubbed a "hacker," and his experience has affected many people, including Apple's founders Ward and Steve Jobs.
而这一切，不过是源于一只哨子。
And all this, but from a whistle.
03.关于哨子最著名的文章，大概是入选过初中语文教材的富兰克林同名散文。
3. Perhaps the best-known whistle article was Franklin's essay of the same name, which had been included in the junior high school Chinese textbook.
富兰克林出生于1706年，他的童年时代，现代哨子尚未问世，所以文中的哨子是一件儿童玩具。
Franklin was born in 1706, his childhood, the modern whistle has not yet come out, so the whistle is a children's toy.
文中，童年的他因为急于得到一只哨子，花了比它原价高四倍的钱。
In the article, he spent four times more than the original price because he was eager to get a whistle.
他从此铭记教训，“不要为哨子花费太多”。
"Don't spend too much money on whistles," he said.
富兰克林用哨子来比喻一切人们过分热衷、付出过高代价的东西。
Franklin used a whistle to describe anything that people were too eager to pay too high a price for.
“……人类极大的悲苦都是由于他们对事物的价值做出了错误的估价而造成的，都是为了他们的哨子付出了太高的代价。
... "The great human misery is caused by their false valuation of the value of things, and they pay too high a price for their whistle.
”当哨子成为一种现代社会的实用工具后，它也就承载了更多隐喻意味。
When the whistle becomes a practical tool of modern society, it carries more metaphorical overtones.
比如，哨子是体育比赛中裁判执法的工具，优秀的裁判于是有“金哨”之称。
A whistle, for example, is a law enforcement tool in sports, and a good referee is called a "golden whistle."
相反，水平糟糕或是有意偏袒的裁判，则会被称为“黑哨”。
Conversely, a bad or intentionally biased referee can be called a "black whistle."
值得玩味的是，“金哨”和“黑哨”有时也非泾渭分明。
Interestingly, the distinction between "gold whistle" and "black whistle" is sometimes not clear-cut.
曾经的中国头号“金哨”陆俊，吹过世界杯比赛，当选过亚洲最佳裁判，却在2010年翻车，变成了收受贿赂的“黑哨”[6]。
China's once-top "gold whistle," Lu Jun, who played in the World Cup and was elected Asia's best umpire, overturned in 2010 to serve as a briber at Ren Ren & # 91; & # 93; & # 39; & # 39;
曾经的“金哨”证明了他优秀的业务能力，但当足球染上盘根错节的利益关系时，从“金哨”到“黑哨”，只在一念之间。
Once a "gold whistle" proved his ability to do his job well, but when football became entangled in a tangled relationship, from the "golden whistle" to the "black whistle," it was just an idea.
哨子很常见。
Whistles are common.
电商平台上唾手可得。
Electronic commerce platforms are readily available.
价格也便宜，普通的不过10元左右。
The price is also cheap. The regular price is only about 10 yuan.
吹哨成本很低，用一个没有染上肺炎的肺，加几块钱，吸口气，吹出去。
It was a low-cost whistle, with a pneumonia-free lung, a few bucks, and a breath, to blow out.
哨子响了。
The whistle blew.
