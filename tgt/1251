2月10日，两名封城前离开武汉，在异地漂泊多日的武汉人向界面新闻反映，他们在回汉途中，被困在湘鄂交界处的一座桥上，进退两难。
On February 10, two Wuhan people who had left Wuhan before leaving the city for several days reported to the Interface News that they were stranded on a bridge at the Hunan-Hubei junction on their way back to the Han Dynasty.
。
.
以下是他们的口述：。
The following is their dictation.
我叫黄克胜，武汉市洪山区人，和我一起被困在这儿的小伙子叫吴昊，他是武汉市武昌区人。
My name is Huang KeSheng, Wuhan Hongshan District, and I trapped here with the young man named Wu Hao, he is Wuchang District of Wuhan City.
我们之前不认识，在岳阳东站高铁站相识，原因是我们都买不到回家的火车票。
We didn't know each other before. We met at Yueyang East Station because we couldn't buy the train ticket.
。
.
1月21日，我从武汉到云南曲靖办事，原计划1月30日回武汉的，但是武汉23日上午就封城了，所以就能没回去。
On January 21, I went from Wuhan to Qujing, Yunnan. I had planned to go back to Wuhan on January 30, but Wuhan was closed on the morning of the 23rd.
。
.
在云南的时候，起初我在朋友家住了11天，之后被朋友住宅所在的社区送到他们那里的酒店隔离，每天收费170元，让我隔离了7天。
When I was in Yunnan, I spent 11 days at a friend's house before being quarantined at a hotel in the neighborhood of my friend's house for 170 yuan a day, leaving me isolated for seven days.
7天后，社区的人又告诉我说手续已经办好了，可以让我买个转乘票，从长沙中转回武汉。
Seven days later, the community told me that the procedures had been completed, I can buy a transfer ticket, from Changsha back to Wuhan.
我交了800元后，他们给了我一张曲靖北到长沙南的高铁票，票面是451元。
I handed in 800 yuan, they gave me a Qujing north to Changsha south of the high-speed rail ticket, 451 yuan.
。
.
社区的人说，现在想回武汉，比如：从曲靖出发，需要到长沙转乘，出站后再换一张票，我当时交的800元，买的就是这么一个通票。
The community said that now want to go back to Wuhan, for example: from Qujing, need to transfer to Changsha, after the departure of another ticket, I paid 800 yuan, bought such a pass.
。
.
2月9日晚上9点多，我到了长沙，等我出站要办中转签证的时候，长沙那边跟我说“完全没这回事”。
February 9, more than 9 p.m., I arrived in Changsha, waiting for me to do the transfer visa, Changsha side of me said "nothing at all."
于是，他们又让我到岳阳来，我随即买了一张到岳阳东站的票，但到了以后，岳阳也说没这回事，我就这样被困在岳阳了。
So, they let me to Yueyang again, I immediately bought a ticket to Yueyang East Station, but after that, Yueyang said there was no such thing, so I was trapped in Yueyang.
。
.
吴昊跟我情况和我差不多，他是1月20日上午从武汉去的广州，昨天从广州直接到了岳阳东站。
Wu Hao and I are similar to the situation, he is January 20 from Wuhan to Guangzhou, yesterday from Guangzhou directly to the East Station Yueyang.
今天早上，我们两个一起去询问岳阳东站的工作人员，看看能否再买票原路返回云南和广东，却被告知连从岳阳返回云南的票都买不到了。
This morning, we both went to ask the staff of Yueyang East Station to see if they could buy more tickets to return to Yunnan and Guangdong.
。
.
原本我们俩想自己“偷渡”回武汉，出火车站时我碰到一个开摩的的，让我们每人交100块钱，把我们拉回湖北境内去，谁知道他刚把我们送到临湘市，就被这里的卡点给拦住了，我们两个都被扣下了。
We both wanted to "smuggle" back to Wuhan. When we left the railway station, I met a kayak who asked us to pay 100 yuan each to take us back to Hubei province.
。
.
扣下以后，执法人员向上级汇报，临湘当地的联合执法人员就开着皮卡车把我们送到了省界处的界桥上。
After the detention, law enforcement officers reported to their superiors that the local law enforcement officers in Linxiang drove us to the boundary bridge at the provincial border in a pickup truck.
到这以后发现，除了我们以外，还有一对湖北的夫妻，带着一个孩子，“像赶鸭子一样，扔下就不管了。
After that, we found that in addition to us, there is a couple of Hubei, with a child, "like a duck, left behind.
”。
"
这座桥叫羊楼司大桥，在107国道上，北边是湖北省赤壁市，桥南是湖南省临湘市羊楼司镇。
The bridge is called Yangshi Bridge, on National Highway 107, Chibi City, Hubei Province, and South Bridge is Yanglou Township, Linxiang City, Hunan Province.
。
.
桥两头都有卡点，我们在桥中间，临湘市那边提供了食物，一人一盒泡面。
There are card points at both ends of the bridge, we provide food in the middle of the bridge, side of Linxiang City, a box of noodles.
吴昊从广州过来，衣服很单薄，临湘这的检查点还给他发了套睡衣让他穿着。
Wu Hao came from Guangzhou, clothes are very thin, Lin Xiang here checkpoint also sent him a suit of pajamas to wear.
但是我带的衣服在长沙出站时被检查人员没收了。
But my clothes were confiscated by the inspectors as I was leaving Changsha.
当时我急着要出站，只有到售票大厅去办改签，才能回武汉。
At that time I was in a hurry to leave the station, only to the ticket hall to do a change, can go back to Wuhan.
。
.
我刚在出站口亮身份证，行李就被扣了。
As soon as I showed my ID at the exit, my luggage was seized.
工作人员说，因为我们是疫区的，必须要收走。
Because we are in an epidemic area, we have to take it away, the staff said.
我现在只有一个公文包在身边，里面只有手机和卫生纸，剩下的行李都被收走了，收走时也没有开暂扣证明。
All I had was a briefcase with my cell phone and toilet paper, the rest of my luggage being taken away without a warrant.
。
.
到目前为止，我和吴昊的体温都正常，毕竟已经在云南和广州隔离了近20天，隔离时也没出过门，途经的每个地方也都检查了，如果我们有问题早就被隔离了。
So far Wu Hao and I have normal body temperature. After all, they have been isolated in Yunnan and Guangzhou for nearly 20 days, and have not been out of quarantine.
。
.
现在是湖北不让进，湖南不让回。
Hubei is not allowed in, Hunan is not allowed back.
我们不知道该怎么办，现在还在下中雨。
We don't know what to do. It's still raining.
吴昊的手机也丢了，他说他好几天没睡觉，现在站都站不住。
Wu Hao also lost his mobile phone. He said he had not slept for days and could not stand now.
。
.
和我们一起等待的一家三口是回咸宁市的，他们比我们幸运，已经联系上了咸宁市政府，被送到了临时救助站，就剩下我和吴昊。
We waited with a family of three Xianning City, they are more fortunate than we have been contacted by the city government, sent to the temporary rescue station, Wu Hao and I are left.
。
.
截至现在（10日12点40分），我们已经被困了两三个小时了，湖北方面也不轻易放行，条件是需要我们户籍所在地开接收证明才可以。
So far (10: 40), we have been trapped for two or three hours, Hubei also not easy to release, as long as we need to open the domicile of our acceptance certificate.
我已经向我的社区反映了，社区说在等上级回话。
I've spoken to my community, and the community says it's waiting for their superiors to talk back.
