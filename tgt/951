图片来源：图虫创意记者：肖芳“ 吴海说，他写文章不是为了自己，而是为所有中小企业呼吁。
2007-9-25 21: 48 "Wu Hai said he wrote the article not for himself, but for all the small and medium-sized enterprises.
”一场突如其来的疫情，打乱了很多公司正常的经营节奏，中小微企业面临的挑战尤为突出。
A sudden epidemic has disrupted the normal pace of business for many companies, with MSMEs facing particular challenges.
2月10日晚，桔子酒店创始人、魅KTV董事长吴海在个人公众号发文《哎，我只是个做中小微企业的》，讲述公司因为疫情遭遇的经营困境，以及对中小企业如何度过难关的思考。
On the night of Feb. 10, Wu Hai, founder of the Orange Hotel and chairman of KTV, sent a message to the public: "Hey, I'm just a MSMEs person," about the company's business difficulties due to the epidemic and how to overcome them.
这篇文章发出后立即在朋友圈刷屏。
Brush the screen in the circle of friends as soon as this article is sent out.
吴海在文章中指出，魅KTV直营店每个月的人力和租赁相关成本为551.5万元，账上现金为1200万左右，因为所有门店停业，收入为零，账上的现金只能撑两个月。
Wu Hai pointed out that the monthly labor and rental-related costs of so-called KTV direct shops were 5.515 million yuan, and the cash on the account was about 12 million yuan, as all stores were closed, with zero revenue and only two months of cash on hand.
因为魅KTV还有加盟店，还有一些在筹建中，如果破产，实际失业的人数有1500人左右，总的投资损失约4亿元。
Because so you think KTV has franchises, and some are in preparation, if bankruptcy, the actual number of unemployed people around 1,500, the total investment losses about 400 million yuan.
虽然各地政府已经针对中小企业出台了缓交社保、中小微企业贷款、国有物业减免租金等政策。
Although governments around the world have introduced small and medium-sized enterprises to slow social security, small and medium-sized enterprises loans, state-owned property rent relief and other policies.
但在吴海看来，这些政策难以真正优惠到中小企业头上，如果不改进的话，中小企业最后依然难逃倒闭。
But in Wu Hai's view, these policies are not really preferential to small and medium-sized enterprises, if not improved, small and medium-sized enterprises will eventually remain bankrupt.
他在文章中提出一些建议，包括：疫情宣布结束前免收社保；被强制停业期间，每个月按照过去交的社保返还给在家待业员工，补贴员工收入，企业复工后再一并发放；疫情结束后继续享受缓交政策；建议对于有需要还房贷的员工，银行把还贷时间延长，疫情期间暂不收。
He made recommendations, including: exemption from social security until the declaration of the end of the epidemic; monthly refunds of past social security payments to homebound workers during the period of forced shutdown, subsidies to employees' income, and the continuation of the company's policy of deferment after the outbreak; and advising banks to extend loan repayment periods to employees who need to repay their mortgages.
界面新闻联系到吴海本人，他表示，疫情属于不可抗力，没有人能想到这种事发生，企业也不可能天天为这种事做准备。
Interface News contacted Wu Hai himself, saying the outbreak was a force majeure, and no one could have imagined it, and businesses could not prepare for it every day.
吴海说，他写文章不是为了自己，而是为所有中小企业呼吁，即使有人单独给他钱他也不要。
Wu said he wrote not for himself but for all the small and medium-sized enterprises, even if someone gave him the money alone.
如果撑不下去，他目前已经做好了关门的最坏打算。
If not, he is now ready for the worst.
以下为界面新闻整理的部分采访实录：界面新闻：你们账上有1200万现金，如果没有疫情，这个数字代表什么样的状态？吴海：我们是一个现金流为正的企业，本身是有盈利的。
You have 12 million dollars in cash on your account.If there is no epidemic, what is the status of this numberWu Hai: We are a positive cash flow company and we are profitable in itself.InterviewDirections: In this part of the test, you will hear 2 passages in Chinese.
意味着正常经营的话，我的现金流会越来越多。
It means my cash flow is going to get bigger and bigger if I run it normally.
现在等于我不开业，就去烧那1200万。
Now if I don't start my business, I'll burn 12 million.
界面新闻：我们最近采访了一些创业公司，大家账上的现金基本都只够两三个月。
Interface News: We recently interviewed a number of startups who had only two or three months of cash on their books.
吴海：不只是创业公司，所有公司都这样。
Wu Hai: It's not just startups, it's all companies.
账上有钱的公司是实在是没办法了，他没地方投钱了。
The company with money on the account is really out of the question. He has nowhere to put his money.
账上有那么多钱的，公司本身是有问题的。
With all that money on the books, the company itself is in trouble.
如果没有疫情正常做生意，五六个月或者更长都是够的。
Five or six months or more would have been enough if the epidemic had not been normal business.
界面新闻：如果没有疫情，有没有预估过今年春节期间的收入？吴海：我们今年加上加盟商的收入应该是5个多亿，春节是一个还可以的月份，一半不好，但有一半特别好。
If there is no epidemic, have you estimated the revenue during the Spring Festival this yearWu Hai: Our combined annual income with the franchisee this year should be more than 500 million, Spring Festival is an acceptable month, half bad, but half is especially good.
界面新闻：文章发出之后，有人想要给资金支持吗？吴海：给我也不要，公平做事，我是为所有企业喊的，不能因为自己喊自己去拿钱。
Wu Hai: Give it to me, don't do it in a fair way, I'm shouting for all the companies, so I can't just yell for myself to get the money.
所有开门做生意的都一样，包括工厂。
All businesses that open doors are the same, including factories.
界面新闻：为什么你特别提出应该对中小企业免收社保？吴海：今天我们要讨论的是碰到大危机时如何应对。
Interface News: Why did you specifically say that SMEs should be exempted from social security? Wu Hai: Today we are talking about how to deal with a major crisis.
比如03年非典、08年金融危机，最后我们都挺过来了。
For example, SARS in 2003, the financial crisis in 2008, we all survived.
原因是那时候社保这些东西负担没这么重，人员工资没这么高，房租没这么贵。
The reason was that social security wasn't so burdensome, people weren't paid that much, and rent wasn't so high.
在这里面，我主要是想说社保这一块，现在社保高是不合理的。
In this, I mainly want to say social security this piece, now the high social security is unreasonable.
人员工资高大家还可以协商解决，比如现在大家不上班一个月给2000块钱生活费，但社保高解决不了，不管上不上班一样交。
For example, people now do not work a month to pay 2,000 yuan living expenses, but high social security can not solve, whether or not to pay at work.
界面新闻：文章发出后，有和相关部门沟通过社保的事吗？吴海：还没有。
Interface News: After the article is issued, and the relevant departments to communicate about social security? Wu Hai: Not yet.
现在我公开发声的一个大前提是，国家已经决定要帮助企业渡过难关，各地也都出台了很多扶持政策。
A big premise of my public voice now is that the country has decided to help companies tide over their difficulties, and many supportive policies have been put in place everywhere.
我呼吁的目的，就是希望政府应该把政策和钱用在对的地方，政策设计的好一点，这是我的目的，不是说为了我自己。
The purpose of my appeal is that the government should put its policies and money in the right place and design the policies better. This is my aim, not for my own sake.
界面新闻：给员工发2000块钱工资的方案开始执行了吗？吴海：还没开始执行，我们内部在讨论。
Interface News: Is the $2, 000 paycheck for employees started? Wu Hai: We haven't started it yet. We're discussing it internally.
界面新闻：还有哪些自救的措施，是否考虑通过线上的方式先获得一部分收入？吴海：没什么措施，现在要么裁员，要么不裁员。
Interface News: What are some more self-help measures, and are you considering getting a portion of your income online? Wu Hai: Nothing, now you have to lay off workers or not.
线上收入是要前期有技术准备的，我们本来计划四月推出线上的，但线上的也赚不了钱。
Online revenue is pre-technically prepared, and we had planned to launch the line in April, but we couldn't make money on the line.
我们现在已经做好了关门的最坏打算。
We are now ready for the worst.
