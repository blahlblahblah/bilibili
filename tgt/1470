作者 | 金玙璠编辑 | 魏佳新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情爆发，餐饮行业首当其冲步入至暗时刻。
The new-style coronavirus pneumonia outbreak in Wei Jia Fan, editor and chief executive officer of Jin Fan, led the catering industry to the darkest hour.
恒大研究院最新发布的数据显示，疫情对餐饮、旅游、电影、培训等行业冲击最大，预计2020年餐饮行业零售额仅在7天内就会有5000亿元的损失。
The latest figures released by the Hang Seng University Institute show that the epidemic has hit the catering, tourism, film and training industries hardest, with retail sales in the catering sector expected to lose 500 billion yuan in just seven days in 2020.
海底捞、西贝、外婆家、眉州东坡这样的大型餐饮，尚能够支撑较久时间，且待疫情过后也较有规模优势，但餐饮行业以小微企业为主，这些企业多数资金链紧张，抗风险能力弱。
Large-scale catering, such as bottom fishing, sibei, grandma's home and eastern slope of Mei Zhou, can survive for a long time and have a greater advantage of scale after the outbreak, but the catering industry is dominated by micro and small enterprises, most of which have tight financial chains and weak risk resistance.
到今天（2月12日）为止，武汉已经“封城”20天，燃财经采访了武汉当地五位中小型餐饮品牌的创始人，其中多位是从业十年的餐饮老将，他们的企业同样处于兑付供应商货款、提前采购春节旺季食材导致的资金短缺高峰期，承担着员工工资、房租等空转成本，同时要挺过比其他地区的同行更长时间的线下关停、外卖关闭的状态，以及面临后续不可预判的长尾效应。
As of today (Feb. 12), Wuhan has been closed for 20 days, and fuel economy interviewed the founders of five Wuhan small and medium-sized food brands, many of whom are 10-year-old food veteran in Wuhan.
多数受访者表示，现金流最多再撑3个月左右。
Most respondents said cash flow could last up to another three months or so.
如果撑不下去，他们会考虑关闭部分门店、压缩营业面积，调整厨房操作模式、扩大外卖比例，减少开支、给员工只发基本工资等方式自救。
If it doesn't work, they might consider closing some stores, cutting back on operating space, adjusting kitchen operations, expanding take-out rates, cutting costs and giving workers only a basic salary.
未来，他们也准备用申请银行贷款、卖房的方式获取更多资金。
In the future, they will also be ready to apply for bank loans and sell houses in order to obtain more funds.
身处漩涡的他们，还传递出了一些不一样的观点。
In the whirlpool of them, but also delivered a number of different views.
有人对员工承诺，疫情期间绝不裁员，并和员工约定这段时间“所有人都不能吃胖”，还有人在物资已经匮乏的情况下，捐食材、捐人工、捐资金，每天坚持为医护人员送餐食。
Some promised not to lay off workers during the outbreak and agreed with them that "no one should eat fatter," while others, already starved of supplies, donated materials, labor, and funds to deliver meals to health-care workers every day.
他们身处武汉，每出一次门都要承受极高的代价，但他们每天不是在找食材，就是在找食材的路上。
They are in Wuhan, each time the door has to bear a very high price, but they are not looking for food materials every day, or on the way to find food.
漩涡之外，肺炎疫情防控已经进入第二阶段，多家大型餐饮的老板已经通过媒体发声，希望出台相关政策，来帮助受疫情影响严重的行业，部分已经找到“共享员工”的自救方式，他们也期待着武汉能出台相应的税费、社保、贷款政策，让大家先喘一口气，但他们更关心疫情何时能结束，在那之前，他们没有心情好好去规划企业的未来。
While some of them have already found ways to help themselves. They expect Wuhan to introduce taxes, social security and loans that will give them a breathing spell, but they are not in the mood to plan for the future of the company until the epidemic is over.
生命大于一切。
Life is above everything.
他们说，压垮一家企业的往往不是灾难本身，而是人心。
Often, they say, it is not the disaster itself that overwhelms a business, but the heart.
如果病毒杀死了爱，那会是更恐怖的事情。
If the virus killed love, it would be more horrible.
武汉封城后的吉庆街来源 / 受访者供图疫情结束只是个开始接下来一连串反应会随之出现娘惹裙厨创始人 吕华涛我们在武汉有三家直营店，营业额正常是6万一天，现在全部关店，产生不了任何收入；春节期间储备了10天的食材，大概20万，因为封城，三四十个员工滞留在宿舍，他们买不到吃的，这些食材都发给员工吃了，加上员工工资每月大概36万到38万之间，这一正一反，对于公司来说，是过百万的损失，现在公司基本断粮了。
Wuhan after the closure of Jiqing Street source / interviewee The end of the epidemic is just the beginning of a series of reactions will follow We have three direct shops in Wuhan, turnover normal 60, 000 days, now all closed shop, about 200,000, because the Spring Festival, 30 or 40 staff stranded in the dormitory, they can not buy food, this is a negative, for the company, about 360,000 to 380,000.
湖北规定各类企业复工时间不早于2月13日24时，如果武汉的商场要求餐厅14号开业，那我只能借钱去进货，不然只能违约。
Hubei stipulated that all kinds of enterprises should resume work no earlier than 2400 hours on February 13. If Wuhan shopping malls require the opening of Restaurant 14, then I have to borrow money to purchase them, otherwise I will have to default.
而按照疫情目前的态势，初步估计会持续到5月底，而且短时间内疫情的阴霾不会过去，员工不愿意来，顾客更是不会到店里消费，我估计3、4月份的日营业额最多是以往的10%-20%，到时候连缴水电费都是个问题，更不用谈员工工资和房租了。
According to the current situation, the epidemic is expected to continue until the end of May, and the haze will not go away for a short time, employees will not want to come, and customers will not go to the store.
我2009年创业，到今年是第十一个年头，据我的经验来看，到时候开店就等于亏钱，那何必还要开呢，做企业，就是要把损失降到最低，我们撑不下去，那只能全部关掉，最多留一家店。
In my experience, when I started my business in 2009, it will be the eleventh year since I started my business. In my experience, when opening a store is equivalent to losing money, why open a business, is to minimize the loss, we can not sustain, it can only be shut down, a maximum of one store.
回顾读书十几年，外企工作十年，创业十年，这三十几年，感触颇深。
Looking back on more than ten years of study, foreign enterprises work ten years, entrepreneurship decade, these three decades, feeling quite deep.
2003年，我在广州买了12套房，创业初期，每在武汉开一家店就要卖一套房，巅峰时期有30家店。
In 2003, I bought 12 suites in Guangzhou. At the beginning of my business, I had to sell a suite for every shop I opened in Wuhan.
但是这些年商业格局变化太快了，如果最初不卖房创业，我可能有很多资产，现在回头一看，什么都没有了，就像南柯一梦。
But the business pattern has changed so fast over the years that if I hadn't started a home in the first place, I would have had a lot of assets.
餐饮业的人员、房租成本已经到了极限值，我在武汉开店这十年，租金从来只有涨，没有跌。
Restaurant personnel, rental costs have reached the limit, I opened a shop in Wuhan this decade, the rent has never fallen.
我们知道业主也很难，但是房地产是长期投资，商铺的损失可以折算到四十年的产权期里，而餐饮是短期行为，损失是折算到三五年里。
We know it's hard for owners, but real estate is a long-term investment and the loss of a business can be reduced to a 40-year equity period, while catering is a short-term activity, with losses commuted to three or five years.
我们光谷一家月营业额130万的店因为租金太高关店了，还有四家店因为修地铁切断式封路，营收大受影响关了，另外有两家店因为店主P2P跑路等原因被迫关掉了。
Our Gwanggu store, which has a monthly turnover of 1.3 million, was shut down because of high rents, and four stores were shut down because of subway cuts, and two others were forced to close down for reasons including owner P2P.
2019年，餐饮行业的人工成本占比高达24%-25%，突破22%的红线两个点，是极其危险的，利润空间低到5%-8%，连银行的贷款利息可能都还不上。
In 2019, the ratio of labour costs in the catering sector was as high as 24 to 25 per cent, exceeding the 22 per cent red line, which was extremely dangerous, with profit margins as low as 5 per cent to 8 per cent, and even bank interest rates might not be paid.
如果租金居高不降，那我的店只能提高人效，调整厨房的操作模式，简化菜谱，压缩面积，增加翻台率，扩大外卖的比例。
If the rent is high, then my shop can only improve efficiency, adjust the kitchen operating mode, simplify menu, compress the area, increase the turnover rate, expand the proportion of take-out.
一开始也不指望能赚钱，因为在很长一段时间里，大多数人害怕外出吃饭，那我们就先接团餐，把员工派出去配送外卖，先运转起来。
We didn't expect to make money at first either, because for a long time most people were afraid to go out to dinner, so we took group dinners, sent our employees out to deliver takeout and started running.
同时减少公司的开支。
At the same time reduce the company's expenses.
我会跟员工谈，能不能接受基本工资，不接受的只能离职；先停缴两个月社保，等有了资金流再补。
I will talk to employees, can accept the basic salary, not accept can only leave the job; first two months of social security, wait for the capital flow to replenish.
现在宿舍里的员工也很焦虑，他们需要钱，但是公司发不了，他们不知道门店会怎么样，见不到亲人，也回不了家。
Now the staff in the dormitory is anxious, they need money, but the company can not send, they do not know what the store will be like, see relatives, can not go home.
湖北二十多万个餐饮企业，其实大家现在的状态比较类似，都非常焦虑，不知道疫情什么时候结束，而就算疫情结束，也只是个开始，接下来一连串的连锁反应都会出现：供应商会来要上个月的货款，大家都非常困难，就可能要打官司；员工会要补贴，或者让补偿一两个月工资他就辞职，你不赔就可能要应对劳动仲裁；手上的贷款怎么还，国家如果不给免息贷款怎么办。
Even if the outbreak is over, it is only the beginning of a chain reaction: suppliers will come to claim last month's money, everyone will be very difficult and may have to go to court; employees will ask for subsidies or compensation for a month or two he resigned, you may have to deal with labor arbitration; the loan on hand, the state if no interest-free loans.
即便疫情结束，只是餐饮人静态的问题结束了，动态的问题随之都会出现。
Even when the epidemic is over, only the static problem of the caterer is over, and dynamic problems will ensue.
卖房也要保住我做了9年的品牌和并肩作战的员工米国煲仔饭创始人 李柏稼我们是一家连锁快餐企业，在武汉有10家门店，其中一家正准备装修，本想卯足了劲在2020年大干一场，没想到遇上了这样的浩劫。
Sales also want to keep my 9-year-old brand and the staff fighting side-by-side. We are a chain of fast food enterprises, 10 stores in Wuhan, one of which is ready to do decoration, would like to make a big effort in 2020, did not expect to encounter such havoc.
春节期间我们计划3家商场店正常营业，从钟南山院士说“病毒能人传人”开始，我们一家一家和商场去做关店申请，写了申请报告，商场才同意。
During the Spring Festival, we plan to open three shopping malls, from Zhong Nan Shan academician said "virus can be passed from person to person," we a family and shopping malls to do shop application, write an application report, the mall agreed.
我们关店一两天后，所有商场也都关停了。
After we shut the shop for a day or two, all the shops were closed.
正常情况下，从正月初五开门营业到元宵节这段时间，所有门店的流水加起来有140万，但是疫情出现了，没有任何现金流，还要负责98位员工的工资、10家门店的租金，非常窘迫。
Normally, from the opening day of the first month to the Lantern Festival, all the stores have 1.4 million running water, but there is no cash flow, 98 employees, the rent of 10 stores, very embarrassed.
我们80%的员工来自武汉以外的湖北省，从好的角度看，我们关店及时，没有影响到员工，目前所有人都是平安的，没有一个家庭染上病毒。
From a good point of view, we closed the shop in time, did not affect the staff, everyone is safe at present, no families infected with the virus.
我一直在工作群里强调，安全第一，充电第二，陪家人第三，让所有人每天报备身体情况，管理层定期在线上做培训直播，组织读书会，带着大家做一些小游戏。
I've been stressing safety first, charging second, spending time with my family, getting everyone to report every day on their bodies, doing regular live training online, organizing book reading sessions, and taking everyone to do some small games.
因为封城有10人滞留武汉，我也会和员工谈心，尤其对一些年轻人进行心理疏导。
Since there are 10 people stranded in Wuhan, I will also talk with staff, especially for some young people psychological counseling.
我们约定所有人都不能发胖，虽说我们是做餐饮的，但现在毕竟物资匮乏，要以节约为本。
We agreed that no one should be fat, although we do catering, but now, after all, material shortages, to be based on economy.
当然，员工最关心的是接下来的安排，我告诉他们：疫情期间绝不裁员，同时也希望员工和我们站在一线，我们和员工商议，从放假以后按基本工资计算。
Of course, employees are most concerned about the next arrangements, I told them: no layoffs during the epidemic, but also want our staff to stand on our side, we consult with staff, from the holiday after the basic salary calculation.
当我把这一点讲出来，所有员工都表示接受，甚至很多人主动提出放弃2月份工资，也有高管提出疫情期间不要一分钱工资，先陪公司度过这次疫情。
When I said this, all the employees accepted, even many offered to give up their February salary, while others offered to stay with the company through the epidemic without a penny of pay during the epidemic.
另外，几个合作多年的房东主动联系我，免2月份房租。
In addition, several landlords who have been working together for years have contacted me to avoid paying rent in February.
种种这些，对我来说都是莫大的鼓舞。
All this is a great encouragement to me.
压垮一家企业的往往不是灾难本身，而是人心。
It is not the disaster itself that overwhelms an enterprise, but the heart.
现在我们企业停摆了，能做的事情非常有限，但只要人心不涣散，就还可以把所有事情恢复起来。
Now that our business is at a standstill, we can do very limited things, but as long as the people do not lax, we can restore everything.
来源 / 受访者供图我最近在看《吉野家的逆境经营学》，在日本近代连锁餐饮历史上，除去吉野家，还没有哪一家日本企业能够在二三十年之内两次从重大危机中脱险，这家企业可以做到，哪怕一天不营业，也能保证全员工资正常发放，持续两年的时间。
2007-9-24 16: 55: 00I recently watched Yoshinoya's Adversity in Business, and no Japanese company in the history of modern Japanese restaurant chains has managed to escape a major crisis twice in two or three decades.
参考当年的非典，这次餐饮业的复苏至少还需要三到四个月，人心的复苏至少再需要一个季度。
With SARS in mind, it will take at least three to four months for the restaurant industry to recover, and at least another quarter for the hearts and minds to recover.
而且即便开业，我预判营业额至少下跌30%，到时可能需要增加外卖或者团餐。
And even if it does, I expect the turnover to fall by at least 30%, possibly requiring extra take-out or group meals.
我们一直注重堂食的体验感，没有过于放大外卖，更没有靠让利充外卖的量，此前堂食、外卖的比例是7:3。
We've always been focused on the experience of cousins, not too big take-out, let alone the volume of take-out, which used to be a ratio of 7: 3.
不过疫情之后，即便不作调整，客观上这个比例也会倒过来。
After the outbreak, however, even if no adjustment is made, the ratio will objectively be reversed.
我也做好了最坏的打算，和老婆商定，哪怕把房子卖掉出去租房住，也要保住做了9年的品牌和一起并肩作战的员工。
I was prepared for the worst, agreeing with my wife to keep my 9-year-old brand and the people who fought side by side, even if I sold my house and went out to rent.
武汉现在所有的餐饮都停了，一些有中央厨房或者有大型食品加工厂的连锁企业，还在为医院无偿供应餐食。
Wuhan now has all its restaurants stopped, some have central kitchens or large food processing plants, and are serving free meals to hospitals.
他们至少还能尽一份力，像我们这种没有中央厨房的，门店也比较小，虽然在春节前储备了80万-100万的食材，但是所有都存放在郊区黄陂区的中央仓库里，封城后运不进来，想尽一份力也实在没有办法。
They can at least do their part, such as ours has no central kitchen, and the store is relatively small. Although 800,000-1 million food materials are stored before Spring Festival, all of them are stored in the central warehouse of Huangpi District, suburb.
不过我相信，疫情之后，武汉的餐饮业会提升一个档次，成为全国的佼佼者。
However, I believe that after the epidemic, Wuhan's catering industry will upgrade to become the best in the country.
因为武汉是漩涡的中心，所有人都会汲取教训，我们的顾客也会提出更高的要求。
Because Wuhan is the center of the whirlpool, everyone will learn the lessons, our customers will also put forward higher requirements.
而未来餐饮恢复的基础是，戴口罩、戴手套不再是作秀，而是从业习惯，所有餐饮人把食品安全放在第一位。
The foundation of future food and beverage restoration is that wearing masks and gloves is no longer a show, but a work habit, and all diners put food safety first.
在生命面前先不要谈经济问题十八号酒馆创始人 王帆我们最老的店开业10年了，有一家店是武汉西餐热门榜第一，还有一家店上了武汉大众点评的酒吧推荐榜，算是全国非常有名的精酿酒馆了。

近三四年，春节期间的聚会多选在酒馆，我们店的客人一年比一年多，因为疫情，原计划在春节期间照常营业的4家店铺关停了，在封城那天，我们各店进行了全面消毒。
In the past three or four years, most of the parties during the Spring Festival have been held in pubs, and our guests have been more and more over the years. Because of the outbreak, the four shops that were supposed to be open as usual during the Spring Festival were closed.
闭店前的全面消毒来源 / 受访者供图我们为春节营业储备了45万左右的食材和酒水，其中一些新鲜的食材和鲜啤，成了留守员工的口粮，还有一部分发放给了医护人员。
/ [^ # 39 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 116] / vt. We have about 450,000 items of food and wine in stock for the Spring Festival business.
现在停业期间，三家店每天损失8-10万的营业额，而公司现金流只能再顶两个半月，如果持续到三个月以上，我只能个人借贷了。
Now, three stores are losing between 80,000 and 100,000 dollars a day during the shutdown, and the company's cash flow is only two and a half months longer. If it lasts more than three months, I have to borrow personally.
餐饮只是我们的板块之一，我们还有贸易公司和啤酒工厂。
Catering is just one of our sections. We also have trading companies and beer factories.
疫情过后，餐饮肯定会慢慢恢复，客观上这次疫情会倒逼餐饮企业成长，更注重生产安全、店铺的操作安全和透明度，以及进货渠道的把控。
After the outbreak, catering will certainly recover slowly, objectively the epidemic will force the catering enterprises to grow, more attention to production safety, shop safety and transparency, and procurement channels control.
我们的贸易公司是对酒吧和餐厅的，现在有些个人用户和销售联系，问能否配送啤酒，但是我们不知道如何完成足够安全的配送服务，也没有拿出非常好的标准，所以贸易公司也暂停了。
Our trading company is for bars and restaurants, and now there are individual users and sales contacts asking if beer can be delivered, but we don't know how to deliver it safely enough, and we don't have very good standards, so the trading company has been suspended.
我比较担心的是酒厂，原本计划春节后推出一款季节性的樱花啤酒，这款酒的生产排期全部做完了，100吨就在酿酒罐里。
I was more worried about the winery, which had planned to launch a seasonal cherry beer after the Spring Festival, and had finished its production schedule, with 100 tons in the brewery.
但是现在最大的困扰，一方面是外界对武汉生产的酒水食品安全的顾虑，不知道会持续多久，也无法做预测，因为非典时期食品饮料行业的规模是现在的1/30，无法和今天相比。
But the biggest worry now is that concerns about the safety of Wuhan-made drinks are unknown for how long and cannot be predicted, as the food and beverage industry in the SARS era was one-thirtieth the size it is today.
另一方面，我们的客户遍布全国各地，不知道物流什么时候能恢复，精酿啤酒的保质期又比较短，导致整个供应链有点乱，生产又必须盯现场，我不能让员工冒着生命危险去值班，所以只能全部停了。
On the other hand, our customers all over the country, do not know when the logistics will resume, brewed beer shelf life is relatively short, resulting in a bit of confusion throughout the supply chain, production must stare at the scene, I can not let staff risk their lives to go on duty, so all had to stop.
最近团队正在想一些出路，我们计划把这个批次的酒在线上平台以义卖形式，捐赠给现在受疫情困扰的人们、奋斗在一线的医护人员。
Recently, the team is thinking of some ways out. We plan to donate this batch of wine online in the form of a charity sale to the people who are suffering from the epidemic and the health care workers who are fighting on the front line.
现在受限于物流，我们只能是预售的形式，先救他人，再自救。
Now limited by logistics, we can only be the form of pre-sale, save others, and then self-help.
以前算账的时候，当金额只是数字，比如说可能要损失200万，没有太深的感触，但是随着疫情的深入，所有板块都停了，当结算日要计算欠供应商的货款、即将要发的工资，当财务把数据发给我，对我的触动还是挺大的。
In the past, when the amount was just a number, maybe two million might have been lost, there was no deep feeling, but as the epidemic progressed, all plates stopped, and when the balance sheet had to calculate the amounts owed to suppliers and the salaries to be paid, when the finance sent me the data, I was touched.
武汉中山大道来源 / 受访者供图我是土生土长的武汉人，心态经历了几个阶段，疫情初期是懵的，随后是恐慌，现在是想办法和自己和解，想自己该如何生活，每天给自己定计划。
Wuhan Zhongshan Boulevard source / interviewee supply diagram I am a native Wuhan people, mentality has gone through several stages, the initial stage of the epidemic is Meng, then panic, now is to find a way and their own reconciliation, think about how to live, make a plan for themselves every day.
我们也在想，能为这座深爱的城市做点什么？于是，我们的员工义务救助了留守武汉的40只猫咪，我们的酿酒师自愿开车接送医生上下班。
We were also wondering what we could do for our beloved city, so our staff volunteered to save 40 cats in Wuhan and our winemaker volunteered to drive the doctors to and from work.
而我从年初一开始，和朋友计划拍一部纪录片，记录武汉的特别时刻，主要采访对象是这座空城的“守城人”，外卖小哥、环卫工人、普通警察、记者……当一座城市生病了，他们依然是供给营养的毛细血管，采访路途中，看见空无一人的京汉大道、吉庆街、凌波门，只有心疼。
From the beginning of the new year, my friends and I plan to make a documentary, records Wuhan special moment, mainly for the empty city "keeper," take out brother, sanitation workers, ordinary police, journalists... When a city is sick, they are still the capillaries of nutrition, interview way, see empty Jinghan Avenue, Jiqing Street, Lingbo Gate, only heartache.
记得从封城第5天开始，江边原本只有国庆才会有的亮化工程每晚都会亮起，江边的楼体上到处都是“武汉加油”。
Remember from the 5th day of the closure of the city, only the National Day will have the bright lights of the project every night, the riverside buildings everywhere "Wuhan refueling.
武汉封城后的月湖桥来源 / 受访者供图但是现在又回到无力感的状态，相比我们这些身处漩涡中心的人，我觉得在外地回不了家、受到歧视的武汉人更痛苦。
Wuhan after the closure of the Moon Lake Bridge source / respondents but now back to the state of powerlessness, compared to us in the center of the whirlpool, I feel unable to go home in the field, the discrimination against Wuhan people more painful.
如果病毒杀死了爱，那会是更恐怖的事情。
If the virus killed love, it would be more horrible.
现在网络上很多声音呼吁大家关注餐饮行业，关注中小企业，经济固然重要，但是现在不是吃不上饭的问题，是生与死的问题，在生命面前先不要谈经济问题。
Now many voices on the Internet call attention to the catering industry, attention to small and medium-sized enterprises, the economy is important, but this is not the problem of lack of food, is a matter of life and death, do not talk about economic issues in front of life.
当市场经济为导向的时候，可能就有人就忘了自己的社会属性。
When the market economy is oriented, one may forget one's social identity.
我整个人都处在救灾状态还没有心情考虑自救捞旺猪肚鸡火锅创始人 叶锦盛捞旺从路边店做起，最初档次不高，后来进了商圈，慢慢往中高端走，到现在门店在武汉有27家，全国有36家。
I was in a state of relief and was not in the mood to consider self-help Wang Chicken Cauldron founder Ye Jinshengwang from the roadside shop, initially not high-grade, then into the business circle, slowly to the middle-high end, now in Wuhan shop 27, the country has 36 stores.
每年一二月份，是猪肚鸡火锅最旺的月份，除了年三十前后一两天生意不太好，2月份营业额保守估计能到1100万左右，但是现在全部关门停业了，还承担着200万的员工工资、190万的房租。
January and February are the hottest months of the year, with the exception of one or two days when business is not so good. Turnover in February is conservatively estimated at around 11 million, but it is now completely closed, with 2 million staff salaries and 1.9 million rent.
湖北规定各类企业复工时间不早于2月13日24时，现在有几个商场叫我2月14日以后营业，我不会开的，至少撑到3月1日以后再说。
Hubei stipulated that all kinds of enterprises should resume work no earlier than 2400 hours on February 13, and now some shopping malls have told me to open after February 14th.
因为即便营业，也没有人敢出门，整个武汉城空荡荡的。
Because even if the business, no one dared to go out, the whole city of Wuhan empty.
而且很多员工年前都回老家了，身体都很健康，我又怎么忍心让他们回到重灾区呢。
And a lot of employees are back home years ago, the body is very healthy, how can I have the heart to let them back to the disaster areas.
现在没有办法，什么都做不了。
There is no way, nothing can be done.
坦率讲，现在疫情还没有稳定下来，我整个人都处在救灾的状态，还没有心情回过头来考虑企业怎么自救。
Frankly speaking, the epidemic has not stabilized, I am in the state of disaster relief, not in the mood to consider how enterprises can help themselves.
从大年三十开始，我和湖北省广东商会另外两个老板，就没有停下来过。
From the beginning of the Chinese New Year's Eve, I and two other employers of Guangdong Chamber of Commerce in Hubei Province did not stop.
我们都是厨师出身，马上凑了一些钱，第二天起就给医护人员供餐。
We were all cooks, put together some money right away and began to feed the paramedics the next day.
因为我们是火锅店，没办法做中餐，就把餐厅春节储备的食材都拿出来，另一个老板负责人工制作。
Because we are a hotpot shop, can not make Chinese food, the restaurant Spring Festival stocks of materials out, another boss in charge of manual production.
到目前为止，我们每天从早上7点干到晚上8点，保证一天把1500份餐做出来、送出去。
So far, we've been working from 7am to 8pm every day, making sure that 1,500 meals are prepared and delivered each day.
医护餐启程送往医院来源 / 受访者供图后来员工实在累了，中途对接了一个志愿者平台，加入了七八位志愿者过来协助我们装盒；装好了以后，很多有车一族的志愿者直接送到武汉同济医院、武汉协和医院，还有雷神山、火神山医院的指挥部。
2007-9-24 16: 23 2008-11-19 16: 40 2008-11-19 16: 40 2008-10-19 16: 40 2008-11-19 16: 40 2008-12-12 22: 40 2008-10-19 16: 40 2008-12-12 22: 40 2008-12-19 16: 40 2008-11-19 16: 40 2008-11-19 16: 40 2008-11-19 19: 19
这些工作人员都只戴着一张口罩，每天承受着极大的风险。
All staff members wear only one mask and are exposed to significant risks on a daily basis.
通过这次疫情，我看到湖北大部分餐饮老板都非常好心，很多人捐钱，但是现在最大的问题是，有钱也没有用。
Through this outbreak, I saw that most of Hubei restaurant owners are very kind, a lot of people donated money, but the biggest problem is now, money is no use.
我动员仟吉面包的同学运来10万个面包做补充，再想要去找牛奶，所有货源都没货了。
I asked my fellow students for more than 100,000 pieces of bread to supplement their efforts. I also wanted to find milk. All the supplies were gone.
还有一些生鲜根本买不到，我就想尽各种办法，联系武汉各个餐厅的老板，他们愿意的话就把食材捐出来，不愿意，我就跟他们商量，能不能卖给我。
There are some fresh can not buy, I would like to do everything possible to contact Wuhan restaurant owners, they would like to donate food, if they do not want, I discussed with them, can sell me.
到初七以后，找食材就没那么困难了，虽然依然封城，但是会允许一些食材进来。
After the seventh day of junior high school, looking for ingredients is not so difficult, although still closed, but will allow some food materials to come in.
这段时间，每天接触一线的医护人员，我最痛恨的是自己没有能力，只能做些能力范围内的事，那就能坚持多久就坚持多久吧。
During this time, daily contact with front-line health care workers, I hate is that I can not do only within the ability to do things, then can persist as long as you can.
对于外卖业务，我没有太大信心武汉柏年丰餐饮创始人 李蜀慧从2019年12月30日，武汉报道第一例疫情开始，我司便按照当年非典的经验，开始安排公司进行自我防护和餐厅消毒的培训。
For take-out business, I do not have much confidence Wuhan BaiNifeng Founder Li Shu Hui from December 30, 2019, Wuhan reported the first outbreak of the disease, we began to according to the SARS experience that year, we began to arrange for the company to conduct self-protection and restaurant sterilization training.
但是同比上一年的业绩，各门店都出现了20%的下滑。
But compared with the previous year, stores posted declines of 20%.
我祈祷疫情不要发展到非典当年停业停工的状态，但是很不幸，直到钟南山先生宣布新冠肺炎病毒有人传人迹象时，商场门店的业绩下滑了90%，我们老八门中餐店的110桌年夜饭全部被客人退订。
I prayed that the outbreak would not end when SARS shut down, but unfortunately, by the time Mr. Zhong Nan Shan announced signs of a human-to-human transmission of the new crown pneumonia virus, store performance had fallen 90% and all 110 New Year's Eve dinners at our eight old Chinese restaurants had been cancelled.
1月22日所有门店全部停业。
All stores were closed on 22 January.
幸运的是，公司十三个直营门店，200多个员工，没有出现一例发热的情况。
Fortunately, the company's 13 direct stores, more than 200 employees, did not have a case of fever.
闭店第二天，合伙人熊飞在网络上看到一线的医生只有泡面吃，餐食得不到保障，于是和朋友发起，把自家库里的食材拿出来，用来给医护人员供餐，很多人加入了。
The next day, partner Xiong Fei saw the first line of doctors on the network only bubble noodles, food is not guaranteed, so and friends launched, take out the food in their own treasures, to feed medical personnel, many people joined.
其实过程中，最难的问题是食材和交通。
In fact, in the process, the most difficult issues are food and transportation.
自家的食材用完了，湖北烹饪协会协调的大量蔬菜、水果、调料用完了，接下来每一天都在寻找食材，外面的食材进不到武汉，当地所有超市都买不到猪肉和新鲜的鱼类。
The Hubei Cuisine Association ran out of ingredients, vegetables, fruits and spices that the Hubei Cuisine Association had coordinated. Every day, they searched for ingredients that could not reach Wuhan.
再者，公共交通停运，员工出不来也回不去，参与医院供餐的人只有10多个，他们现在每天承受着高风险在作业，这期间公司支付双倍工资。
In addition, public transport is out of service and employees are unable to reach their homes, and only over 10 people who take part in hospital meals are now exposed to high-risk operations on a daily basis, during which time the company pays double wages.
这些是我们目前能做的事情，能做多久就做多久吧，我现在每天祈祷，员工中千万不要有病例出现，如果有，这件事肯定没办法进行了。
These are the things we can do now, and do them as long as we can, and I pray every day that there will be no cases among the staff, and if there is one, there is absolutely no way to do it.
医护餐制作完毕来源 / 受访者供图2019年，只有20%的餐饮人能挣到钱，行业已经很难了，大家原本是非常期盼这个春节的，把利润都拿去再投入了，把员工、食材、资金各方面储备的力量都放在了春节，谁也没有想到，突然下了一场“雪”。
2007-9-19 15: 23 2008-12-12 13: 23 2008-12-19 19: 55: 00By 2019, only 20% of the catering industry could earn money. The industry had been looking forward to the Spring Festival and put the profits back into it.
我司春节备货100万，退订损失30万，每月人工、房租固定成本都在110万，公司现金流已经断掉了。
Our Spring Festival stock 1 million, write-off losses of 300,000, monthly labor, rent fixed costs are 1.1 million, the company's cash flow has been cut.
据我所知，所有同行都损失惨重，企业越大损失越大。
As far as I know, all our peers have suffered a lot, and the bigger the business, the greater its losses.
武汉几家大型宴会每家春节备货都在500万以上，退订就有一千多桌，只能闭店，临时交通封闭，员工有家不能回，都呆在宿舍每日以零食泡面充饥。
Wuhan several large banquet every spring festival in more than 5 million, cancellation of more than a thousand tables, can only close shop, temporary traffic closure, staff can not go home, stay in the dormitory daily snacks bubble hunger.
所有上游供货商也损失巨大。
All upstream suppliers also suffered significant losses.
尤其华南海鲜市场，自1月1日整个市场封闭后，任何货物都无法取出，有的海鲜老板损失上千万，很多门店都是个体经营者全家的生活收入来源。
The South China seafood market, in particular, has been closed to all goods since January 1, and some seafood owners have lost tens of millions of dollars, with many stores serving as a source of income for the entire family.
我目前能想到的自救措施都是比较常规的：继续甲方谈判，能不能减免部分房租；再想办法贷款；未来在餐厅的食材供应、服务上更注重健康，因为大家发现拼到现在拼得就是抵抗力。
I can now think of self-help measures are more conventional: continue party A negotiations, can you reduce part of the rent; then think of ways to loan; in the future in the restaurant supplies, services more health-oriented, because it has been found that up to now spell is the resistance.
但是对于外卖业务，我没有太大信心。
But I don't have much confidence in the take-out business.
餐饮行业的利润率只有10%，外卖平台在收取配送费以后，继续抽成20%-25%，我们哪里还有利润，如果未来还是这么高的扣点，即便做也不挣钱。
The restaurant industry's profit margin is only 10%, and the delivery platform continues to collect 20% -25% after the delivery fee, where is our profit margin, and if the future is so high, even if it does not earn money.
以我目前了解的信息预估，武汉餐饮行业的冰冻期至少要到5月份。
According to the information I know so far, the freezing period in Wuhan restaurant industry will be at least until May.
其实我们餐饮企业现在做公益也都是打肿脸充胖子，大家都是想让疫情快一点结束。
In fact, we catering enterprises are now doing public welfare are fat, we all want to let the epidemic end a little bit faster.
成都、江苏都出台了扶持中小企业的政策，武汉能不能也有相应的税费、社保、贷款的政策出来，对地产业主提供规模化补贴，再通过3-6个月以上的免租惠及到终端餐饮企业，让大家先喘一口气，企业自己再想办法承担员工的生活问题，没有钱发工资，我们发米发油也不会让员工饿肚子，也希望政府在出台政策的时候，能不能优先考虑在这次疫情中做贡献的企业以及不裁员的企业。
Chengdu, Jiangsu have issued policies to support small and medium-sized enterprises, Wuhan can also have the corresponding tax, social security, loan policy to provide large-scale subsidies to property owners, through rent-free three-to-six months to the end of enterprises, so that enterprises can take their own way to pay employees, we do not pay salaries, we can give priority to the policy of enterprises contributing to the epidemic and non-layoffs.
不过我们理解，现在政府还无暇顾及我们，毕竟先要解决当前的医疗问题。
But we understand that the government does not have the time to care about us, after all, to solve the current medical problems.
