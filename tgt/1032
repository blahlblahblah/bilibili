武汉卫健委最新通报，“不明原因肺炎”已排除SARS和MERS，但病原体仍未明确。
Wuhan health committee reported recently that "unknown causes of pneumonia" has ruled out SARS and MERS, but the pathogen is still unclear.
武汉患者已增至59例，重症7例，均在接受隔离治疗，无死亡病例。
Wuhan patients have increased to 59 cases, severe 7 cases, are receiving isolated treatment, no death cases.
香港特区等地加强了对来自武汉人员的监测，香港每日公布疑似案例，最新数字是16例。
Surveillance of personnel from Wuhan has been stepped up, including in the Hong Kong SAR. Suspected cases are reported daily in Hong Kong. The latest figure is 16.
新加坡4日发现1个疑似病例，5日证实与武汉肺炎无关。
Singapore 4 found a suspected case, confirmed on the 5th is not related to Wuhan pneumonia.
本次武汉肺炎呈现明显的聚集性特征，类似特征的疫情近年来时有发生，但都没有引起大规模的公共卫生事件。
This Wuhan Pneumonia presents obvious aggregation characteristics, similar characteristics of the epidemic in recent years, but did not cause large-scale public health events.
武汉市“不明原因肺炎”疫情持续引发关注。
The outbreak of "unknown pneumonia" in Wuhan city continues to cause concern.
目前仍未明确是何种病原体。
It remains unclear what the pathogen is.
武汉卫健委1月5日晚就此发布第三份通报，表示已排除流感、禽流感、腺病毒、严重急性呼吸道综合征（SARS）和中东呼吸综合征（MERS）。
Wuhan Health Committee on the night of January 5 issued the third notice, said the flu, avian flu, adenovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has been ruled out.
截至1月5日8时，武汉市共报告符合不明原因的病毒性肺炎诊断患者59例，重症7例（12月31日首份通报中，患者是27例，7例病情严重；1月3日通报中，患者44例，重症11例），其余患者生命体征总体稳定。
As of 0800 hours on January 5, Wuhan city had reported 59 cases of viral pneumonia with unknown causes and 7 cases of severe illness (27 cases and 7 cases were serious in the first notification on 31 December; 44 cases and 11 cases of severe illness were reported in the notice of January 3), while the vital signs of the remaining patients were generally stable.
目前所有患者均在武汉市医疗机构接受隔离治疗，无死亡病例。
At present, all patients in Wuhan city medical institutions were isolated treatment, no death cases.
从武汉前往其他地区的人员中，也发现一些疑似肺炎病例。
Some suspected cases of pneumonia have also been found among people traveling from Wuhan to other areas.
其中香港特区监测到的人数最多，截至1月5日中午12时，香港卫生署共接到16起报告。
The largest number of cases was detected in the HKSAR. As at 12 noon on 5 January, 16 reports had been received by the Department of Health.
经检测，8例为流感（7例甲流），1例其他疾病，1例冠状病毒229E感染（非SARS），6例未检出明确病毒。
Eight cases of influenza (7 cases of flow A), one case of other diseases, one case of coronavirus 229E infection (non-SARS) were detected, and 6 cases were not detected.
由于病原鉴定和病因溯源工作正在进行中，尚不能确定从武汉到香港的相关病例与武汉出现的不明原因肺炎病例存在关联。
As pathogen identification and etiological traceability are ongoing, it has not been possible to establish a link between cases from Wuhan and Hong Kong and cases of unexplained pneumonia in Wuhan.
武汉卫健委的三次通报均表示，此次疫情未发现明显的人传人证据，未发现医务人员感染。
Wuhan health committee three times reported that the outbreak did not find significant evidence of human-to-human transmission, no medical staff found infection.
曾在2003年参与SARS病原调查和诊断的病毒学研究专家管轶日前在接受财新采访时表示，相信官方对于病毒类型已经有了初步判断，因为病原鉴定中的核酸检测大约2至3天就可以获得结果，但病因溯源需要进行血清学检测和确认，需要2至4周。
In a recent interview with Caixin, an expert in virology who participated in the investigation and diagnosis of SARS in 2003, Guan Yi said recently that the official judgment on the type of virus is preliminary because the nucleic acid test in the pathogen identification can get results in about two to three days.
此次疫情的关联地——位于武汉市江汉区的华南海鲜市场已经休市整顿。
The epicenter of the outbreak, the South China seafood market in Wuhan's Jianghan district, has been closed.
相关部门正在开展环境卫生处置和进一步的卫生学调查。
Environmental health disposal and further sanitary surveys are being carried out by the relevant authorities.
管轶认为，先集中病人控制传染源，再寻找动物传染源堵漏洞的方向是正确的。
Guan Yi thinks, collect patient to control infective source first, look for the direction that animal infect source plugs a loophole is correct again.
据2019年9月的一则报道，国庆前夕，武汉市区两级市场监管部门曾对华南海鲜市场售卖虎斑蛙、蛇、刺猬等动物的商户进行排查。
According to a report in September 2019, on the eve of the National Day, the city's two-tier market regulator conducted a search of traders selling tiger frog, snake, hedgehog and other animals in the South China seafood market.
说明该市场有这些野生动物销售。
This indicates that the market has these wild animals for sale.
此次疫情是否与市场内的野生动物相关，也要等官方调查结果出来才能确定。
Whether the outbreak is linked to wildlife on the market will not be determined until the official results of the investigation are available.
最新疫情：报告患者持续增加，重症减少据武汉卫健委1月5日晚间的通报，截至当日8时，共发现符合不明原因的病毒性肺炎诊断患者59例，重症7例，相比两天前的通报，减少了4例。
Up to 8: 00 a.m. on the same day, a total of 59 cases of diagnosis of viral pneumonia with unknown causes and 7 cases of severe illness were found, a decrease of four cases compared with the two days earlier.
在59例患者中，最早发病时间为2019年12月12日，最晚发病时间为12月29日；已经追踪到163名密切接触者并行医学观察。
In 59 cases, the earliest onset was on 12 December 2019 and the latest on 29 December; 163 close contacts were traced to parallel medical observations.
此次武汉所有不明原因肺炎患者都集中在武汉市金银潭医院（原武汉市医疗救治中心）隔离治疗。
All the patients with unexplained pneumonia in Wuhan are concentrated in Wuhan City gold and silver pool hospital (formerly Wuhan City Medical Treatment Center) isolated treatment.
该院是武汉地区唯一一家省市共建的、具有近百年历史的公共卫生医疗救治基地。
The hospital is the only one built in Wuhan, with a history of nearly 100 years of public health medical treatment base.
△ 图片来源：武汉市金银潭医院官网据新京报此前报道，目前金银潭医院收治的疫情相关患者中，并不全都是确诊的肺炎患者，也包括了一些只有感冒症状，但因为近期和华南海鲜市场有过接触的疑似病例。
Not all of the patients admitted to the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital have been diagnosed with pneumonia, and some have only symptoms of colds but are suspected to have recent contact with the South China seafood market, the Beijing News reported earlier.
这些病人大多是武汉市内其它医院回溯过往病例筛查出的疑似感染者，送到金银潭医院来做进一步确认。
Most of these patients were screened back to other hospitals in Wuhan city suspected infection, sent to the gold and silver pool hospital for further confirmation.
医院方面表示，在隔离区内，肺炎患者和非肺炎患者会分开住，非肺炎患者如果症状好转，三天以后就可以出院。
The hospital said pneumonia patients and non-pneumonia patients would be separated in the quarantine zone, and non-pneumonia patients could be released after three days if their symptoms improved.
武汉卫健委12月30日发布的红头文件要求：未经授权，任何单位、个人不得擅自对外发布救治信息。
Wuhan health committee issued December 30 red document requirements: Without authorization, no unit or individual shall release treatment information to the outside world without authorization.
1月1日下午，武汉警方通报，有8人因发布、转发关于武汉市肺炎疫情的不实信息，被依法查处。
On the afternoon of January 1, Wuhan police reported that eight people were investigated and punished for publishing and transmitting false information about pneumonia in Wuhan city.
武汉不明原因肺炎疫情公布后，香港特区、澳门特区、台湾地区乃至新加坡，都在入境口岸加强了对来自武汉人员的监测。
Since the publication of the Wuhan Unexplained Pneumonia epidemic, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the Macao SAR, the Taiwan region and Singapore have all stepped up surveillance of persons from Wuhan.
1月3日开始，香港特区政府每日公布加强监测下的疑似肺炎个案数字。
Since 3 January, the HKSAR Government has published daily the number of suspected pneumonia cases under enhanced surveillance.
过去14天内曾到访武汉并有发烧或肺炎症状的患者即纳入统计，截至1月5日中午12时，共监测到病例16例。
Those who had visited Wuhan in the past 14 days and had symptoms of fever or pneumonia were counted. As at 12 noon on January 5, 16 cases had been detected.
△ 香港特区卫生署官网截图1月4日，香港特区政府公布《对公共卫生有重要性的新型传染病准备及应变计划》并同时启动“严重”应变级别。
On January 4, the HKSAR Government announced the "New Infectious Disease Preparedness and Response Plan of Public Health Importance" and activated the "Serious" Response Level.
该计划包含三个应变级别：戒备、严重及紧急。
The plan has three levels of response: alert, severe and emergency.
严重级别对应风险为中等。
The corresponding risk at the level of severity is moderate.
澳门卫生局报告，从1月1日至今，共接获4起发病前14天曾到访武汉，而出现发烧和呼吸道症状的病例通报，但已全部确诊为流感或普通感冒。
The Macao Health Bureau reported that since January 1, four cases of fever and respiratory symptoms had been reported to Wuhan 14 days before the onset of the disease, but all of them had been confirmed to be influenza or common cold.
台湾地区卫生部门自去年12月31日起，启动由武汉直航赴台班机的登机检疫，并且每天发布关于关于武汉肺炎疫情的最新信息。
Since December 31, 2007, the Taiwan health department has started the boarding and quarantine of a direct flight from Wuhan to Taiwan, and has issued daily updates on the situation of pneumonia in Wuhan.
1月5日公布，共查出8名症状轻微旅客，经评估后返家休息。
On 5 January, a total of eight passengers with mild symptoms were identified and assessed as returning home to rest.
其中2人诊断为流感，1人为一般感冒、1人已退烧、1人为支气管炎并已退烧，另3人由地方卫生当局持续追踪关怀。
Two of them were diagnosed with influenza, one with a common cold, one with a reduced fever, one with bronchitis and reduced fever, and the other three were followed up by local health authorities on an ongoing basis.
此外，新加坡卫生部1月4日宣布，该国出现首宗疑似不明肺炎病例，患者为三岁的中国女童，曾到访武汉。
The country's first suspected case of unidentified pneumonia, a three-year-old Chinese girl who visited Wuhan, was reported by the Ministry of Health on Thursday.
不过据最新消息，该病例已证实与武汉肺炎无关。
But according to the latest news, the case has been confirmed to have nothing to do with Wuhan pneumonia.
新加坡卫生部要求，所有从武汉飞往新加坡的旅客，都必须在抵达樟宜机场时接受体温检测。
Singapore's Ministry of Health requires all passengers flying from Wuhan to Singapore to have their body temperature tested on arrival at Changi airport.
随着监测的持续，新加坡也可能出现新的疑似与武汉肺炎有关的病例。
As surveillance continues, new cases of cases suspected to be linked to Wuhan pneumonia are also likely to emerge in Singapore.
不明原因肺炎历年都有2003年“非典”流行之后，国家卫健委的前身卫生部为了筛查可能的SARS病例和人感染禽流感病例及其它传染性呼吸道疾病，早期发出预警并采取相应的防控措施，制定了《全国不明原因肺炎病例监测实施方案（试行）》。
Unknown Causes Pneumonia After the SARS epidemic in 2003, the Ministry of Health, the predecessor of the National Fitness and Health Commission, formulated the National Implementation Program (Trial) for Monitoring Cases of Unknown Causes of Pneumonia in order to screen for possible cases of SARS and human cases of avian influenza and other infectious respiratory diseases.
2007年，该方案升级为《全国不明原因肺炎病例监测、排查和管理方案》。
In 2007, the programme was upgraded to the National Programme for Monitoring, Screening and Management of Unknown Causes of Pneumonia.
根据方案：相关病例要同时具备以下4项条件：1、发热（腋下体温≥38℃）；2、具有肺炎的影像学特征；3、发病早期白细胞总数降低或正常，或淋巴细胞分类计数减少；4、经规范抗菌药物治疗3-5天，病情无明显改善或呈进行性加重。
According to the program: 1, fever (armpit temperature is 38 ℃); 2, Pneumonia imaging features; 3, the number of leukocytes in the early stage of onset is reduced or normal, or the lymphocyte classification is reduced; 4, after 3-5 days of standard antimicrobial treatment, there is no significant improvement or progressive aggravation.
2006年5月，卫生部印发的《传染病信息报告管理规范》中，规定了三种需要报告的病种，“不明原因肺炎病例和不明原因死亡病例等重点监测疾病”包含其中，排在法定传染病和其他传染病之后。
In May 2006, the Ministry of Health issued the "Guidelines for the Reporting and Management of Infectious Disease Information," which set out three types of diseases that need to be reported, including "focused disease surveillance such as pneumonia cases and unexplained deaths," among others, after statutory infectious diseases and other infectious diseases.
在“后非典”时期，不明原因肺炎监测对中国人感染禽流感病例的早期发现和报告起到了重要作用。
During the post-SARS period, the monitoring of unexplained pneumonia played an important role in the early detection and reporting of cases of avian influenza among Chinese.
根据《疾病监测》杂志2010年发表的《2004-2009年中国不明原因肺炎病例报告情况分析》，5年当中，全国31个省级行政区通过疾病监测信息报告管理系统、电话和传真报告的不明原因肺炎病例共864例，其中确诊人感染禽流感病例35例（同时期全国总共发现38例确诊人感染禽流感病例），排除不明原因肺炎诊断为其他疾病的793例，截至2009年尚未排除不明原因肺炎诊断的有36例。
According to an analysis of the reported cases of unknown pneumonia in China 2004-2009 published in the Journal of Disease Surveillance in 2010, out of 864 cases of unidentified pneumonia reported by disease surveillance information reporting management system, telephone and fax, 35 cases of confirmed human avian influenza were reported in 31 provinces and municipalities (out of a total of 38 confirmed human cases of avian influenza in the same period).
在这一统计周期内，2004年4～5月北京市和安徽省的小规模SARS疫情、2005～2006年冬春季和2009年初的人感染禽流感疫情期间，有明显的不明原因肺炎报告高峰。
During this statistical cycle, there were significant peaks in unexplained pneumonia reported during the small-scale SARS epidemic in Beijing and Anhui provinces in April-May 2004, and the human cases of avian influenza in the winter and spring of 2005-2006 and early 2009.
而在其余大多数月份，全国每月的病例报告数均不超过10例。
For most of the remaining months, there were no more than 10 reported cases per month nationwide.
查询知网可以看到，近年来各地均有一些不明原因肺炎的监测报告，但这些病例都没有引起大规模的公共卫生事件。
As you can see, in recent years, there have been a number of unexplained pneumonia monitoring reports around the world, but none of these cases has caused a large-scale public health event.
对比历史报告数据，这一次武汉突然出现27个病例（截至1月3日下午，病例上升至44例），确实稍显异常。
In contrast to historical data, Wuhan suddenly had 27 cases this time (44 as of the afternoon of January 3), which is a slight anomaly.
不过，此次武汉不明原因肺炎大部分为华南海鲜城经营户，呈现出明显的聚集性特征。
However, the Wuhan unidentified causes of pneumonia for the majority of South China Hai Xiancheng households, showing obvious aggregation characteristics.
类似的聚集性不明原因肺炎疫情，近年来时有发生。
A similar epidemic of unexplained pneumonia has occurred in recent years.
查阅相关资料发现，2018年5-6月，北京市房山区某小学曾出现26例聚集性不明原因肺炎疫情，最后判定为支原体感染。
From May to June 2018, 26 cases of agglomeration pneumonia were found in a primary school in Fangshan District, Beijing.
2014年3月上旬，山东威海胸科医院也集中收治了某医院39例临床表现相似的聚集性不明原因肺炎医务人员，其中37例经过常规治疗后恢复正常。
In early March 2014, Shandong Weihai Chest Hospital also received 39 hospital staff with similar clinical manifestations of conglomerate pneumonia, 37 of whom returned to normal after routine treatment.
值得注意的是，有一些研究指出，中国不明原因肺炎报告病例数较实际情况偏少，且有一定延迟。
It is worth noting that some studies have pointed out that the number of reported cases of unspecified pneumonia in China is lower than the actual number, with some delay.
主要原因是不明原因肺炎监测针对的是人感染禽流感和SARS，这两种疫情对经济社会稳定影响重大，各级卫生机构在报告时都会慎之又慎，以免引起不必要的恐慌。
The main reason is that unexplained pneumonia surveillance targets people with avian influenza and SARS, both of which have a significant impact on economic and social stability, and health agencies at all levels report with great care to avoid unnecessary panic.
不是SARS，病原可能是什么？12月30日晚曾有一张手机拍下的病原检测单在朋友圈中流传，上面显示的检出高置信度阳性指标包含SARS冠状病毒。
What could be the cause of the disease? On the night of December 30, a cell phone-based pathogen test was circulated in a circle of friends showing high-confidence-detecting indicators that included the SARS coronavirus.
该信息一度引起高度紧张。
At one point, the message was highly charged.
目前官方通报已经排除是SARS的可能性。
Official notification has ruled out the possibility of SARS.
导致感染性疾病的病原微生物包括细菌、病毒、真菌、寄生虫等。
Pathogenic microorganisms that cause infectious diseases include bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, etc.
细菌是微米级颗粒，在普通显微镜下就能看到。
Bacteria are micron-sized particles that can be seen under ordinary microscopes.
而病毒是纳米级，需要借助电子显微镜才能观察到。
Viruses are nanoscale and need an electron microscope to see them.
从生命的形态上，病毒是遗传物质和蛋白质裹在一起的一个生物大分子。
In the shape of life, a virus is a biomolecule that is encased in genetic material and protein.
一般来说，病毒检测要先做分子检测，再在显微镜下通过形态学观察，确认病毒。
In general, the virus detection to do molecular detection, and then under the microscope through morphological observation, confirm the virus.
病原微生物分子检测方法众多，但这些方法都各有弊端。
There are many molecular detection methods for pathogenic microorganisms, but all of them have disadvantages.
免疫学方法操作简单，但由于病原体种类繁多，已研发的抗原、抗体数量远远不能满足需求。
Immunological methods are simple to operate, but due to the variety of pathogens, the number of antigens and antibodies developed is far from satisfying the needs.
基因芯片技术较新，但只能对已知的病原体基因组进行意向性筛查，而无法检测新的未知病原体。
Gene chip technology is relatively new, but only indicative screening of known pathogen genomes is possible, and new unknown pathogens cannot be detected.
获得病原体的活体也是一大难点：病原体的体外培养耗时普遍较长，操作步骤繁琐，且绝大多数病原体不可培养。
Obtaining a pathogen in vivo is also a major challenge: the in vitro culture of pathogens is generally lengthy, the operational steps are cumbersome, and most pathogens are not cultivable.
目前全球感染性疾病的发病率有所上升，病原体呈现多样化和复杂化的趋势。
The incidence of infectious diseases has increased globally and pathogens are tending to diversify and become more complex.
各种新发和再发的感染性疾病、不易发现的多重感染以及不明病因的发热病例增多，但据统计，约70%的感染性疾病患者都无法确定病原体信息。
There has been an increase in new and re-emerging infectious diseases, multiple infections that are less likely to be detected, and fevers of unknown origin, but statistics indicate that approximately 70 per cent of patients with infectious diseases are unable to identify pathogen information.
当年SARS病毒的确认也经历了一番曲折。
The SARS virus of that year also experienced some twists and turns.
2002年底，中国广东等地出现了多例原因不明的、危及生命的呼吸系统疾病。
At the end of 2002, there were a number of cases of life-threatening respiratory diseases in Guangdong, China.
随后，越南，加拿大和中国香港等地也先后报道了类似病例。
Subsequently, similar cases were reported in Vietnam, Canada and Hong Kong, China.
世卫组织将此类疾病命名为“严重急性呼吸道综合征（SARS）”。
The WHO has named the disease "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)."
随后世界各国实验室都致力于发现这种疾病的病原体。
Laboratories around the world then worked to discover the pathogen of the disease.
2003年3月，香港大学和美国疾病预防控制中心先后在SARS病人的样本中分离出一种病毒，该病毒粒子外周有冠状排列的纤突，在电子显微镜下看起来就像一顶中世纪欧洲帝王的王冠，根据形态学特征和遗传信息，科学家认为这种新型的冠状病毒就是SARS的致病病原。
In March 2003, the University of Hong Kong (HKU) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) isolated a virus from samples of SARS patients with coronal fibers that looked like a crown of medieval European emperors under an electron microscope. According to morphological characteristics and genetic information, scientists believe the new coronavirus is the pathogen of SARS.
2013年4月，世卫组织在各方面研究成果基础上，正式将其命名为SARS冠状病毒。
In April 2013, WHO officially named the coronavirus SARS, based on the results of various studies.
SARS冠状病毒属于冠状病毒科，其家族成员众多。
SARS coronavirus belongs to coronavirus family, and its family members are numerous.
冠状病毒也是成人普通感冒的主要病原之一。
Coronavirus is also one of the main causes of common colds in adults.
目前已经发现的冠状病毒，能感染人类的有6种，分别为20世纪60年代发现的人冠状病毒HCoV-229E和HCoV-OC43，2003年出现的SARS冠状病毒SARS-CoV，2004年发现的人冠状病毒HCoV-NL63，2005年新发现的人冠状病毒HCoV-HKU1以及2012年7月在中东地区出现的新型人冠状病毒HCoV-EMC（该病毒引发的疾病后来被命名为中东呼吸综合征，英文简称MERS）。
The coronavirus that has been found to infect humans include the human coronavirus HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 in the 1960s, the human coronavirus HCoV-NL63 in 2003, the new human coronavirus HCoV-HKU1 in 2005 and the new human coronavirus HCoV-EMC in the Middle East in July 2012.
此次武汉不明原因肺炎的病原检测，武汉卫健委的最新通报中，尚未排除冠状病毒的可能。
Wuhan unknown causes of pneumonia pathogen detection, Wuhan Health Commission of the latest notification, has not ruled out the possibility of coronavirus.
据此前媒体报道，中国科学院武汉病毒研究所正在地方卫生管理部门的指挥下做相关病原检测方面工作。
According to former media reports, Wuhan Institute of Virus of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is working under the command of local health authorities on pathogen detection.
该所拥有我国唯一一个P4（生物安全最高等级）生物实验室。
The Institute has the only P4 (highest biosafety level) biological laboratory in the country.
相关负责人表示，如果需要，会按规定要求启动P4相关流程。
The person in charge indicated that P4-related processes would be initiated as required.
