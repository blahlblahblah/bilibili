南都，换一种方式。
Nandu, a different way.
从1月18日开始逆行北上武汉调研开始，或者说从更早的1月16日参加广东省首例输入性病例的调研开始，中国工程院院士、国家呼吸系统疾病临床医学研究中心主任、高级别专家组组长钟南山的2020年春天，异常忙碌。
Starting from January 18, when Wuhan Research Retrograde northward began, or January 16, when the first case of imported cases in Guangdong Province was investigated, Zhong Nan Shan, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and director of the National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Diseases and head of a high-level panel, Zhong Nan Shan.
这位83岁的科学家，如同17年前抗击非典疫情时一样，一直奋战在抗击突发公共卫生事件的第一线。
The 83-year-old scientist, like the SARS epidemic 17 years ago, has been at the forefront of the fight against public health emergencies.
我们曾尝试通过公开的新闻报道，私下的印证、核实，来梳理出钟南山院士1月以来的作息轨迹，结果发现近两个月时间里，包括春节期间在内，他几乎没有一天完整的休息时间。
We have tried to tease out the tracks of the academician's work since January through public press reports and private verifications and found that he had not had a full day off for nearly two months, including during the Spring Festival.
3月14日上午，钟南山院士。
Academician Zhong Nan Shan, March 14, morning.
医疗救治方案制定中有他，在科研攻关协调中有他，在省内、省际的远程会诊中有他，国际科技合作中也是他。
Medical treatment plan has him, in the coordination of scientific research, in the province, provincial remote consultation has him, international scientific and technological cooperation is also him.
如同17年前一样，钟南山三个字就意味着顶级流量。
Like 17 years ago, Zhong Nan Shan three characters means top flow.
一个简短的教人戴口罩的视频，能迅速成为现象级的热搜。
A short video instructing people to wear masks can quickly become a phenomenal hot search.
每一次有他出席的新闻发布会，现场一定是水泄不通，提问环节一再延长，他从来不会拒绝回避。
Every time he attended the press conference, the scene must be full, the question link was extended repeatedly, he never refused to avoid.
3月14日上午，周六。
Saturday, 14 March.
钟南山院士在结束一个会议后，在百忙之中接受了“最美逆行者”项目拍摄和采访。
Academician Zhong Nan Shan in the end of a meeting, in the busy accepted the "most beautiful inverse" project filming and interviews.
他依然如此敏锐、坦荡、风趣。
He was still so keen, so magnanimous, so witty.
基于亲身经历，他回顾了去武汉后的所见所闻所感；基于家国责任，他详谈为什么希望加强疾控中心（CDC）的地位；基于临床实践，他聊了从第一版到第七版治疗方案的演变；同样基于严格的效果评价，他告诉我们疫苗研发井然有序，未来可期；基于专业判断，他认为还没有证据证明新冠肺炎今后会季节性流行。
Based on his personal experience, he reviewed what he had seen and heard since his visit to Wuhan. Based on his family responsibilities, he discussed why he wanted to strengthen the CDC. Based on clinical practice, he talked about the evolution of treatment options from Version 1 to Edition 7.
坚韧如青松，亦有满腔侠骨柔肠。
Tenacious as pine, but also filled with chivalrous soft bowel.
他曾在全国人民面前眼眶含泪，因为疫情当时仍未控制，目睹着全国医务人员都在武汉前线搏杀，武汉人民在风雨之中坚挺；再一次潸然落泪是为悼念一个好医生，“为众人抱薪者，不可使其冻毙于风雪”，他认为李文亮是一个英雄。
He had tears in his eyes all over the country because the epidemic was still unchecked, watching medical workers fight on the front lines in Wuhan and the people of Wuhan firm in the storm. To mourn a good doctor, he thought he was a hero.
中国的疫情正在得到有力控制，全面复工、复产、复学指日可待。
China's epidemic is under strong control, with full resumption of work, production and schools within reach.
钟南山院士也通过南方都市报寄语莘莘学子，不论大、中、小学生：“以实践为师，相信自己的实践，比相信权威更加重要”。
Academics in Zhong Nan Shan, through the Southern Metropolis Daily, also have a distinctive academic flavor: "To practice, to believe in one's own practice, is more important than to believe in authority."
Play【南都N视频】视频：李琳 林耀华 王道斌 实习生 周予仪 编辑：陈蓓蕾核心要点1 回顾疫情：从深圳一家6口聚集性病例判断肯定有人传人现象，也从在武汉的学生处获悉了一些不太乐观的情况，到了湖北以后，进一步追问时，发现在湖北一个大医院出现了医务人员感染。
2007-9-24 16: 16 [hide] Li Lin Yaohua Wang Road Intern Zhou Yu-yi, editor: Chen Bulei's core point 1 Review of the epidemic: Judging from a six-person aggregation of cases in Shenzhen, also learned from students in Wuhan some less optimistic situation, after further questioning in Hubei, found that a major hospital in Hubei medical staff infection.
在1月中，湖北省的实际情况，远比当时公开或新闻报道的要严重。
In mid-January, the actual situation in Hubei province was far more serious than that of public or news reports at the time.
2 防控复盘：如果封城推后5天，全国到3月份后的发病峰值应该是17万。
Prevention and control: If the closure of the city five days later, the national peak after March should be 170,000.
早期的科学防控、预警极为重要，必要的紧急情况下，CDC应该有权力直接向社会发出预警。
Early scientific control and early warning are essential, and the CDC should have the power to warn society directly in case of emergency.
建议提升CDC地位。
Recommend upgrading of CDC status.
3 重要判断：新冠肺炎成为季节性流行病的证据还不足。
IMPORTANT DETERMINATION: There is not enough evidence that New Crown Pneumonia is a seasonal epidemic.
4 传染率、致死率：从传播指数来看，流感的传播指数接近1.5，SARS是2-2.5，新冠肺炎接近3，新冠肺炎的传播率更高。
4 Infection rate, fatality rate: In terms of the transmission index, influenza transmission index is close to 1.5, SARS is 2-2.5, new crown pneumonia is close to 3, and the rate of transmission of new crown pneumonia is higher.
SARS的病死率接近10%，MERS接近30%，如果积极防控，目前新冠观察到数据在1%左右，新冠肺炎的病死率要低许多。
The SARS fatality rate is close to 10% and that of MERS is close to 30%. If active, the new crown will be about 1% and the death rate from Newcrown Pneumonia will be much lower.
5 治疗经验：摸着石头过河，国外同行也在跟我们索取诊疗技术方案。
Therapeutic experience: Touching the stones across the river, foreign counterparts are also asking us for a diagnosis and treatment programme.
我们中国的救治经验对国外也有一定的指导作用。
Our experience in Chinese treatment can also provide some guidance to foreign countries.
院士心声1 我觉得这些说出真话的医生（李文亮），当时他们说的话没有得到重视，甚至还要被训诫，我觉得很委屈。
I feel aggrieved that the doctors who spoke the truth (Li Wenliang) did not pay attention to what they said and were even reprimanded.
2通过这一次新冠疫情，我希望广大的社会、公众，能够相信我们医务人员。
Through this new crown epidemic, I hope that the community, the public, can trust our medical staff.
我们中国的医生绝大多数都是很尽责任、很有责任感，而且他们是真正献身于这个事业的一群人，他们从来都是白衣天使，从未离开过。
Most of our Chinese doctors are very responsible and responsible, and they are really dedicated to the cause of a group of people, they have always been white angels, never left.
3从本心来讲，更愿意到临床一线管病人，“可学生们不这么想，很多医务人员、我的学生，不允许我进去，嫌我太老了，不合适进去。
From the heart, prefer to clinical first-line patients, "but the students do not think so, many medical personnel, my students, do not allow me to enter, think I am too old to enter.
”4 与学子共勉：对于别人讲的东西，不见得要相信，关键要眼见为实。
It is not necessary to believe what others have to say, but to see what is true.
要以实践为师，相信自己的实践，比相信权威更加重要。
To learn from practice, to believe in their own practice, than to believe in authority is more important.
家国情怀1. 收到在武汉临床一线工作的学生反馈，情况有些不一样南方都市报（以下简称南都）：作为一位呼吸疾病专家，您一直都非常关注湖北的情况，在您去1月18日去湖北之前，您有和湖北那边了解过沟通过吗？就是说您了解过湖北当地的情况吗？取得了哪些信息？钟南山：其实在去湖北之前，我们就通过对广东疑似病例的了解，发现了一些家庭聚集性传播的证据。
As a specialist in respiratory diseases, have you been following the situation in Hubei Province very much? Do you know anything about the local situation in Hubei Province? Zhong Nan Shan: In fact, before going to Hubei, we found some evidence of sexual transmission in some families before you went to Hubei.
1月16日，广东省召开紧急协调会议时，我才比较多地知道这个消息。
On January 16, I learned more about the emergency coordination meeting in Guangdong Province.
我到了湖北以后，接到很多正在武汉临床一线工作的学生的电话，以及此前参加了国家医疗组的医生的一些看法。
When I arrived in Hubei province, I received many phone calls from students who were working on the Wuhan clinical front line, as well as some opinions from doctors who had joined the National Medical Group before that.
让我比较意外的是，学生们的情绪都比较低落，他们反馈的一些情况，跟我后来听到的不一样。
To my surprise, the students were in a lower mood and their feedback was different from what I heard later.
学生们反馈的关键问题就是，湖北的实际情况，远比当时公开或新闻报道的要严重。
The key problem for students' feedback was that the actual situation in Hubei was far more serious than what had been revealed or reported at the time.
已经有很多的迹象表明，这一疾病是有人传人的。
There are already many signs that the disease is passed down from person to person.
我在没有听总结、没有听他们汇报之前，就有了一个很强的印象。
I had a strong impression before I listened to the summary and the presentation.
2.追问出湖北出现医务人员感染南都：就是说在您去湖北之前，已经接触了那个深圳的家庭聚集性病例的情况？这对您最后的研判有帮助吗？钟南山：确实，广东最早发现的深圳一家6口先后发病的案例，有5例是去过武汉，可有1例只是和跟他们有接触，但是从来没去过武汉。
2, the emergence of medical staff in Hubei Nandu: that is to say, before you go to Hubei, you have contact with the Shenzhen family agglomeration case? Zhong Nan Shan: Indeed, Guangdong first discovered a case of 6 people in Shenzhen, five cases have been to Wuhan, but one case only contact with them, but has never been to Wuhan.
那么这里面肯定是有人传人的现象。
Then there must be a phenomenon of human-to-human transmission.
对于我们搞急性传染病的人来说，人传人是一个非常重要的标志。
For those of us who are dealing with acute infectious diseases, human-to-human transmission is a very important symbol.
以前我们发现高致病性禽流感H7N9对人感染，能确定是由禽传人。
Previously, we found highly pathogenic avian influenza H7N9 in humans, can be identified by poultry-to-human transmission.
过去是在禽类间传染，现在突然传染人了，病毒出现变异了。
What used to be bird-to-bird transmission is now suddenly contagious and the virus has mutated.
到了湖北以后，我跟学生们详细地了解情况。
When I got to Hubei, I got to know the situation in detail with my students.
和当地交流时，我进一步追问时，发现在湖北一个大医院出现了医务人员感染。
When I pressed further with the local people, I found that there was an infection of medical staff in a big hospital in Hubei Province.
这对于突发公共卫生事件而言，又是一个非常危险的信号。
This is a very dangerous signal for public health emergencies.
所以当发现这两个问题的时候，我就要把事实告诉政府，告诉公众。
So when I find out about these two issues, I tell the government and the public.
因为一旦出现聚集性人传人的话，病毒的传播会非常快，而且会很快引起广泛传播。
Because once there is an hermit, the virus can spread very quickly and quickly become widespread.
疫情会带来社会的动荡、对经济发展产生影响。
The epidemic will bring about social unrest and impact on economic development.
3.更愿意到临床一线管病人，“可学生们‘嫌’我太老了”南都：您现在还去一线看病人，管理病人吗？钟南山：跟17年前不一样了，我现在比较少直接进到病房去管理新冠肺炎的重型、危重型患者了。
3. Prefers to clinical frontline patients, "But the students think I'm too old." NANDU: You still go to the front line to see the patient and manage the patient? Zhong Nan Shan: Unlike 17 years ago, I now have less direct access to the wards to manage the severe and critical cases of pneumonia.
好在现在的技术进步，可以让我比较容易通过视频技术直接了解患者的病情。
Fortunately, the current technological progress, I can more easily through video technology directly understand the patient's illness.
再就是我们现在很多医务人员、我的学生，不允许我进去。
And then we have a lot of medical staff, my students, who don't allow me in.
这个也担心，那个也担心，嫌我太老了（笑），不合适进去。
This also worries, that also worries, dislikes me too old (laughs), does not fit in.
其实本心上，我很乐意和患者打交道。
In fact, in my heart, I am happy to deal with patients.
治理建言3月14日上午，钟南山院士。
Governance advice March 14 morning, Zhong Nan Shan academician.
1. 提升CDC地位，是为了给全社会争取时间窗南都：您提出了要加强CDC（疾病预防控制中心）的建设并提升其地位。
The purpose of upgrading the CDC is to gain time for society as a whole: You have proposed to strengthen the CDC and upgrade its status.
您提这个建议是基于什么样的考量？钟南山：我们知道经过漫长的历史时期后，现在的人与自然之间的关系并不是很和谐，特别是人跟野生动物之间的关系。
Zhong Nan Shan: We know that after a long historical period, the relationship between human beings and nature is not very harmonious, especially the relationship between people and wild animals.
这个地球本来是很适合人生存的，可由于人为的很多因素，比如吃野生动物等活动，造成了生态环境的变化。
The earth was originally a good place to live, but many man-made factors, such as eating wild animals, have brought about changes in the ecological environment.
这种变化，会导致动物传染病跨物种传播概率的增加。
This change can lead to an increase in the probability of cross-species transmission of zoonotic diseases.
最近这几十年来出现的新发传染病，80%都是经由动物传播给人类的，包括艾滋病、高致病性禽流感、三次冠状病毒的传播。
Of the new infectious diseases that have emerged in recent decades, 80 percent have been transmitted to humans through animals, including AIDS, highly pathogenic avian influenza, and the transmission of the coronavirus three times.
在这个大背景下，其实需要一个强有力的疾病预防与控制体系。
In this context, a strong disease prevention and control system is needed.
CDC在西方国家的地位是比较高的。
CDC's position in western countries is relatively high.
急性传染病是突发性公共卫生事件，既然是突发，就会来得很快，发展得更快，就像这一次新冠肺炎疫情。
Acute infectious diseases are sudden public health events, and since they are sudden, they come quickly and develop more rapidly, like this one.
CDC，不应该仅仅是一个单纯的信息收集的技术机构，简单地将信息上报给上级部门，再由上级部门来决定（是否向公众公开）。
The CDC, instead of being a mere information-gathering technical body, simply reports the information to a higher authority, which then decides whether it is open to the public or not.
CDC应该被赋予更大的权力，在紧急的情况下，它甚至有权力能够向公众公布作为预警。
The CDC should be given greater powers, and even have the power, in an emergency, to make it public as an early warning.
有时候，差几天就差很远。
Sometimes, a few days is a long way off.
强调加强CDC建设，提升CDC地位，正是为了争取这样的时间窗。
The emphasis on strengthening the CDC and upgrading the CDC status is precisely to strive for such a window of time.
2. CDC应有一定行政权钟南山：当前我们的CDC，基本上就是一个技术部门，它只负责调查资料，完了以后上报给有关部门。
CDC should have some executive power, Zhong Nan Shan: At present, our CDC is basically a technical department, which is only responsible for investigation data, after which it is reported to the relevant departments.
这就非常考验我们有关部门的认识程度，不同的认识程度可能造成千差万别的结果。
This is a great test of our understanding of the relevant departments, different levels of awareness may result in very different results.
举个例子，我们在17年前应对非典问题时，我们发现了一个聚集性的感染后，就比较警惕了。
For example, when we responded to SARS 17 years ago, we were alerted when we discovered a concentrated infection.
当时广东就向全省发放通知文件，告知公众新发现了一个不明原因的急性传染病，它的特点怎么样，请大家要注意防护，要注意隔离。
At that time, Guangdong issued notification documents to the whole province to inform the public of the discovery of a new acute infectious disease of unknown origin, its characteristics, please pay attention to the protection, pay attention to quarantine.
再就是2015年上海出现了一家三口同时感染高致病性禽流感H7N9时，因为有这方面意识，医务人员和公共卫生人员立即警惕起来。
Then, in 2015, Shanghai saw the emergence of a family of three people infected with the highly pathogenic avian influenza H7N9, for which medical and public health personnel were immediately alerted.
经过认真的监测、分离病毒，结果发现了H7N9感染。
After careful monitoring and isolation of the virus, the H7N9 infection was found.
而且当时也没有出现严重的人传人现象，并没有造成疫情的散播，带来更为深远的影响。
And there was no serious human-to-human transmission, which did not spread the epidemic, with far-reaching consequences.
这一次也是这样。
This time it was the same.
2019年12月30日，已经有医生发现了一家三口的聚集性发病。
By December 30, 2019, a family of three had been found to have an episode of agglomeration.
这个信号应该引起地方部门、CDC的高度重视。
This signal should arouse the attention of local department, CDC.
虽然只是发现了这个事情，分离出新型冠状病毒，但是没给予足够重视，才会出现后来的问题。
Although only discovered this matter, isolates the new coronavirus, but did not pay enough attention to, can appear later the problem.
延缓了对它的控制，造成了疫情的传播。
It has slowed down control and caused the spread of the epidemic.
所以我说CDC应该有一定的行政权，除了资料、信息收集、并在技术上做一些鉴定、研判以外，在紧急的情况下，CDC应该可以向社会直接公布出现的疫情情况，立刻让大家重视这个问题，及时警惕及时预防。
So I would say that CDC should have some executive power. Besides data, information collection, and technical evaluation, the CDC should be able to announce the situation directly to the public in emergency situations.
3.武汉封城若推后5天，全国发病峰值可能有17万钟南山：我们做了一个病情的预测，基于一个传统的模式，再加上我国的强力干预因素，再使用我们的AI分析系统，在一月底二月初用了10天与真实发生的数字进行对照，并调整模型。
If Wuhan is closed five days later, there may be a peak of 170,000 Zhongnanshan in the whole country: we made a prognosis and based on a traditional model, coupled with our strong intervention factors, we used our AI analysis system to compare the actual numbers and adjust the model for 10 days at the end of January and early February.
在2月份就得出了我国的疾病高峰大概是7万多人发病的结果，远比国外预测的数据更接近真实情况。
In February, it was concluded that the peak of the disease in our country was probably more than 70,000 cases, far closer to the truth than the data predicted from abroad.
当时中央在1月23日提出来，武汉要封城，同时全国各地配套做好联防联控，其核心就是：做好自我防护、自我检测、及时诊断、及时隔离。
At that time, the central government in January 23, Wuhan to seal the city, and at the same time complete all over the country to do a good Union Control, its core is: do a good job of self-defense, self-detection, timely diagnosis, timely isolation.
所以疫情在全国湖北以外省份没有出现暴发，哪怕比较多病例的两个省——广东、浙江，也就1000多例，而且以输入性为主。
So there have been no outbreaks in provinces outside Hubei province. Even Guangdong and Zhejiang, two provinces with more cases, have recorded more than 1,000 cases, mainly of imported sex.
我们也曾经进行了预测，如果类似的封城行动再往前面5天，到现在为止，全国的病例数大概会是2万左右；但是如果再推后5天，全国到3月份后的发病峰值应该是17万。
We also predicted that if similar closures continued for the first five days, the number of cases nationwide would be around 20,000 so far; but if we delayed another five days, the peak would be 170,000 nationwide by March.
早期的科学防控措施是极为重要的。
Early scientific control measures are extremely important.
这些工作谁来做？应该是CDC来做，进行研判、预测。
Who will do this? It should be the CDC to do the research, prediction.
必要的紧急情况下，CDC应该有权力向社会发出预警。
In case of emergency, the CDC should have the power to warn society.
权威解读3月14日上午，钟南山院士。
An authoritative interpretation of March 14 morning, academician Zhong Nan Shan.
1.很多治疗方案是中国临床一线首先提出来的南都：新冠疫情以来，作为国家卫健委高级别专家组组长，您一直有参与我国的治疗方案的制定，从第一版到第七版，有一个怎样的演变过程？钟南山：是的，从第一版开始我就参与了治疗方案的制订。
Since the outbreak of the New Crown, what has been the evolution of your involvement in the development of treatment programs in our country, from Edition 1 to Edition 7? Zhong Nan Shan: Yes, I have been involved in the development of the treatment plan since the first edition.
到了第二版以后，我就被要求主持诊疗方法的改进。
By the second edition, I had been asked to lead the improvement in diagnostic methods.
对于这样一种全新的疾病，开始时我们对它的病原学、传播途径都不明确，以为就是飞沫、接触传播。
For such a completely new disease, at the beginning of its etiology, the way of transmission are not clear, think it is droplets, contact spread.
随着研究的深入，我们逐渐有了进一步的认识，包括从粪便、尿液中培养出活病毒后，我们就开始警惕新的、潜在的传播途径可能。
As the study progressed, we gradually learned more about the possibility of new and potential routes of transmission, including the development of live viruses from feces and urine.
对新冠肺炎的认识，也是逐步加深的过程。
To the new crown pneumonia understanding, is also gradually deepens the process.
比如潜伏期多长？发病特征有哪些？如何会加重？以及用什么药物来治疗控制？这些问题都是不断探索、不断更新的过程。
For example, how long is the incubation period? What are the characteristics of the disease? How can it be aggravated? And what kind of drugs are used for treatment and control? These problems are constantly being explored and updated.
我们实际上是摸着石头过河。
We actually cross the river by feeling rocks.
这期间，我们发现了潜伏期具有传染性，我们发现了很多早期的病患不一定有发烧，再比如我们发现了一些有效的办法、方案，我们都在不断补充，充实到新版的治疗方案当中。
During this period, we found that incubation period is infectious, we found many early patients do not necessarily have fever, and we have found some effective methods, programs, we are constantly replenishing the new treatment program.
从抗病毒药物阿比多尔、克力芝到磷酸氯喹、再生医学领域的干细胞治疗和恢复期血浆的应用，这些都是我们基于临床实践找到的方案，并在甄别后放到了新版本的方案当中。
From the antiviral drugs Abidol, Kaletra to chloroquine phosphate, stem cell therapy and convalescent plasma use in regenerative medicine, we have found these solutions based on clinical practice and have been screened into new versions.
其中很多方案是我们中国临床一线首先提出来的。
Many of these proposals were first put forward by our Chinese clinicians.
此外，在治疗端，我们也添加了采用氢气、氧气混合气体吸入的方案。
In addition, on the therapeutic side, we have added a hydrogen and oxygen mixture of gas inhalation programmes.
在临床实践中，我们发现了这样能够减少呼吸道阻力，使患者的缺氧情况得到较快改善。
In clinical practice, we found that this can reduce respiratory resistance, so that the patient's hypoxia situation was improved relatively quickly.
这些基于临床实践的方案，对新冠肺炎患者的救治都起到了一定的指导作用。
These clinical practice-based programmes have played a guiding role in the treatment of patients with new crown pneumonia.
现在国外同行，也在跟我们索取诊疗的技术方案。
Now our foreign counterparts are also asking us for technical solutions.
我们中国的救治经验对国外也有一定的指导作用。
Our experience in Chinese treatment can also provide some guidance to foreign countries.
2.新冠肺炎会季节性流行？没有证据南都：有专家认为新冠肺炎可能像流感那样，每年冬春季就出现，您如何看待？钟南山：现在把新冠肺炎说成是一个常态的，像流感那样季节性出现的流行病，我觉得为时过早。
What do you think of the seasonal epidemic of New Crown Pneumonia? NANDU: Some experts think the new crown pneumonia may appear every winter and spring like the flu, what do you think?
这个世纪，已经出现了三次冠状病毒引发肺炎的突发公共卫生事件。
This century, there have been three outbreaks of coronavirus-induced pneumonia in public health emergencies.
2003年的非典，2013年的MERS中东呼吸综合征，再就是当下的新冠肺炎，三次都是突然发生的。
SARS in 2003, the MERS Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in 2013, and now the New Crown Pneumonia, all three of which occurred suddenly.
新冠肺炎会不会变成一个类似流感那样的季节性流行病？目前我看可能性还不大。
Is it possible that the new crown pneumonia will turn into a seasonal flu-like epidemic? I don't see much chance yet.
新冠跟流感有许多不同，其一就是传染性比流感更强，从传播指数来看，流感的传播指数是接近1.5，SARS是2-2.5，新冠肺炎接近3，新冠肺炎的传播率更高。
The new crown differs from the flu in many ways. One is that it is more contagious than influenza, with a spread index of close to 1.5 for influenza, 2-2.5 for SARS, close to 3 for new crown pneumonia and higher for new crown pneumonia.
而且相较于其他两种冠状病毒引发的疾病，新冠肺炎的病死率要低许多。
And the death rate of coronavirus is much lower than that of the other coronavirus-related diseases.
SARS的病死率接近10%，MERS接近30%，新冠肺炎，如果积极防控，观察到数据也就在1%左右。
SARS had a fatality rate close to 10%, MERS close to 30%, and new crown pneumonia, about 1% if actively controlled.
再就是我们目前监测到的资料证据，还不足以让我们产生新冠肺炎会变成季节性疾病的判断，我看现在的证据还不够。
Again, the data we are currently monitoring are not enough to allow us to judge that new crown pneumonia is seasonal, and I don't think there is enough evidence.
新冠肺炎为什么会出现？它会不会跟气候的变化和各种外界的生态条件变化有关？现在还不是很清楚。
Why the outbreak of new crown pneumonia? Is it related to climate change and changes in ecological conditions outside? It is not clear.
3.咽拭子机器人采样会比较安全准确南都：在科研领域您广泛涉猎，目前在治疗端、预防端，有没有一些提振大家士气的成果？钟南山：在预防方面我们做了许多工作，以前的经验告诉我们，采集患者咽拭子的过程其实相当高危，也比较容易出现假阴性等结果不准的问题。
3. Swallowing swabs Sampling is safer and more accurate in the south: Do you have any morale-boosting results in the field of scientific research? Zhong Nan Shan: We have done a lot of work on prevention.
所以研发了咽拭子机器人，能够比较准确地采样。
So a pharyngeal swab robot was developed to sample accurately.
我们还研发了一些负压、层流的诊疗台，就是发热门诊诊疗台和个人防护的病床。
We have also developed a number of negative pressure, laminar flow clinics, clinical heating clinics and personal protection beds.
有了这些设备，病人呼出的气体将被较好地收集起来，医生、护士就不会跟病毒直接接触。
With these devices, the patient's exhaled gas would be better collected and doctors and nurses would not come into direct contact with the virus.
在诊断端，我们针对新冠肺炎患者在患病3-4天往往会产生IgM抗体的特性，开发了新型的血清检测手段，更为灵敏、高效、准确。
At the diagnostic level, we developed a new serological method for detecting IgM antibody in patients with new crown pneumonia for 3-4 days, which is more sensitive, efficient and accurate.
大家关心的疫苗，广东也一直在进行全力研发，进展很快，而且是“几条腿”一起走。
As for the vaccines, Guangdong has been doing its best to develop them. They are making rapid progress and are "several legs" walking together.
有mRNA疫苗、重组蛋白疫苗，以腺病毒、纳米材料做载体的疫苗。
There is mRNA vaccine, recombinant protein vaccine, to adenovirus, nanomaterials as carriers of vaccines.
在过去的两个月里，广东、全国的科研团队都在加紧努力攻关。
Over the past two months, research teams in Guangdong and around the country have been stepping up efforts to tackle the problem.
当前的疫情已经进入“外防输入”阶段，疫苗的需求会非常大，非常迫切。
The current epidemic has entered the stage of "external defense input," the need for vaccines will be very large, very urgent.
随着疫情在全球范围的传播，持续的时间也会长一些，疫苗制作非常重要。
Vaccine production is important as the epidemic spreads around the world and lasts longer.
在治疗端，我们正进行一些严格的对照实验。
On the therapeutic side, we are conducting some rigorous controlled trials.
比如磷酸氯喹的应用，现在初步看起来是有一定效果的。
The use of chloroquine phosphate, for example, now appears to have some effect.
再比如瑞德西韦的应用，也在加速进行临床验证。
The application of Rhetsevier, for example, is also accelerating clinical trials.
如此多方面的广泛研究，让中国的临床医生和17年前比起来有极大的不同。
Such extensive research makes Chinese clinicians very different from those of 17 years ago.
现在，大多数医务人员不仅把论文写在祖国大地上，也把论文写到世界各个国家，写到了临床实践当中。
Nowadays, most medical staff not only write essays on the land of the motherland, but also in every country of the world, and write them in clinical practice.
4.重型以上患者的小气管、小气道里的上皮细胞破坏较强南都：您多次在会诊、方案制定时提出来的加强重症患者小气道的管理，现在的应用效果如何？钟南山：加强重型、危重型患者的小气道管理，我们一直在采用，也取得了一定的效果。
4.Small trachea and small airway epithelial cells in patients with severe or above are more destructive than those in the south of China: How effective are the small airway enhancement measures that you put forward in your consultations and programs? Zhong Nan Shan: Strengthening the small airway management of heavy and critical patients.
结合病理来看，新冠肺炎有和非典同样的典型性病毒肺症状，比如小血管的破坏、坏死、微血栓的形成、上皮脱落，以及间质性纤维化等。
Combined with pathology, New Crown Pneumonia has the same typical viral pulmonary symptoms as SARS, such as small vessel destruction, necrosis, microthrombosis, epithelial detachment, and interstitial fibrosis.
我们还注意到重型以上新冠肺炎患者的小气管、小气道里的上皮细胞破坏比较厉害，容易造成堵塞，再就是包括肺泡、小气道里有大量的纤维素性渗出，这些液体填充，造成后面的治疗非常困难。
We also noted severe damage to epithelial cells in the trachea and small airways of patients with severe or severe new crown pneumonia, leading to blockage, and large amounts of cellulose seepage, including alveoli and small airways, filled with fluid that makes subsequent treatment very difficult.
发现问题后，我们也提出早期使用大剂量的祛痰剂和抗氧化剂，以及适当进行纤维支气管镜的吸引、冲洗，对一些病人是能够起到辅助作用的。
We also suggest that early use of large doses of expectorants and antioxidants, as well as proper aspiration and rinsing of fiberoptic bronchoscope, can be helpful to some patients.
国士风范1月28日，钟南山在广州接受新华社专访，说到动情处眼眶含泪。
Guoshi demeanor January 28, Zhong Nan Shan in Guangzhou Xinhua interview, said the emotional eye socket tearful.
新华社有没有沧海横流，医务人员都在显英雄本色南都：一直以来，大家认识的是一个专业、坚韧的钟南山院士，但这一次疫情中，我们发现您数次动情落泪。
There are no vicissitudes of the Xinhua news agency, the medical staff are all heroic South Du: all along, we know a professional, tenacious Zhong Nan Shan academician, but this time, we found you moved to tears several times.
其实您是一个感性的人吗？哪些事情会让你变得感性起来？钟南山：我想，这个很复杂。
In fact, you are a sensible person? Which things will make you sensuous? Zhong Nan Shan: I think, this is very complex.
第一次（接受新华社采访时），就是我们当时的疫情并没有根本性的控制，疫情依然发展得非常快，当时有忧虑。
For the first time (in an interview with Xinhua), there was no fundamental control of our epidemic, and the epidemic continued to develop very quickly, and there was concern at the time.
再加上看到我们前线武汉医务人员的艰辛，很有感触。
In addition to see our front-line Wuhan medical staff of the hardships, very touched.
第二次（悼念李文亮医生），我觉得这些说出真话的医生，当时他们说的话并没有得到重视，甚至还要被训诫，我觉得很委屈。
For the second time (in tribute to Dr. Lee Man-liang), I felt aggrieved that the doctors who spoke the truth were not being taken seriously and were even reprimanded.
我必须再次重申，我国绝大多数的医务人员，从来都是白衣天使，他们从未离开过这个名称，也无从说起让白衣天使精神回归。
I must reiterate once again that the vast majority of our medical personnel, who have always been angels in white, have never left that name or spoken of the return of the spirit of the angels in white.
我们从来没变，从不同时期，不同的阶段，从我们医务人员的表现中就看得出来了。
We have never changed, as can be seen from the performance of our medical staff at different times and at different stages.
有没有沧海横流，我们的医务人员都在显英雄本色。
There are no vicissitudes of the sea, our medical staff are showing heroism.
通过这一次新冠疫情，我希望广大的社会、公众，能够相信我们医务人员。
Through this new crown epidemic, I hope the community, the public, can trust our medical staff.
我们中国的医生绝大多数都很尽责任、很有责任感，他们是真正献身于这个事业的一群人。
Most of our Chinese doctors are very responsible and responsible. They are a group of people who are really dedicated to this cause.
院士寄语3月14日上午，钟南山院士。
Academician address March 14 morning, Zhong Nan Shan academician.
1.学习最重要的是学好基本功南都：随着疫情的逐渐控制，我们会开始慢慢迎来复课。
The most important thing to learn is to learn basic skills well. With the spread of the epidemic under control, we will begin to gradually ushered in the resumption of classes.
您觉得我们的大、中、小学生群体，在这一次举国的抗疫行动中，能从中学习到什么？钟南山：在这次抗击新冠肺炎的过程中，学生们放假的时间比较长，我觉得最关键的不是学到了新冠肺炎这个疾病怎么防治。
What do you think our university, middle and primary school students can learn from this national campaign against SARS? Zhong Nan Shan: In this fight against the new crown pneumonia, the students have more time off, I think the most important thing is not to learn how to control the disease.
更重要的是学到了一种精神——中华民族团结抗疫的精神。
What is more important is to learn a spirit - the spirit of the Chinese nation to unite against the plague.
由于国家的高度组织性，使得我们能够将全国人民动员起来，为了抗击新冠疫情这一个目标来共同努力。
The highly organized nature of the country has enabled us to mobilize the entire population to work together towards the goal of fighting the new crown.
（这其中大家学到的）是两点，一是解决好小我和大我之间关系的问题，为了控制新冠疫情，使得大家有很多不便，要待在家里，但大家都能自觉地做出牺牲，所以减少了疫情的播散。
There are two things you can learn. One is to work out the relationship between the ego and the ego. In order to control the new crown, we have a lot of inconvenience and have to stay at home, but we can all make voluntary sacrifices and reduce the spread of the epidemic.
这个方面，大家都做得很好，很好地处理了大我和小我之间的关系。
In this respect, we all do a good job of handling the relationship between the ego and the ego.
还有一点，就是学会了用科学的精神去应对新冠肺炎疫情。
Another point is to learn to use the scientific spirit to deal with the outbreak of pneumonia in the new crown.
防治新冠肺炎需要有科学精神，要有科学研究也要有科学知识。
It needs scientific spirit, scientific research and scientific knowledge to prevent and treat the new crown pneumonia.
如果下一次有其他的事情，或者同学们在其他领域遇到了问题，也要明白，解决问题需要有科技、科研支撑。
If there is something else to do next, or if students encounter problems in other areas, understand that solving problems requires scientific and technical support.
而科技科研的支撑关键是打好基础。
And the key to supporting scientific research is to lay a good foundation.
所以不管是小学、中学、大学，都是要打好自己的学习基础，大学生要打好专业基础。
So no matter be primary school, middle school, university, all want to lay a good foundation of oneself study, undergraduate should lay a good professional foundation.
具有了良好的基础，才能够进行进一步的科技攻关。
With a good foundation, only then can carry on the further science and technology attack.
就像这一次，大家经过10年、20年蓄势待发，一旦遇到情况，就能够利用自己的经验、知识，创造出新的方法，找到更快的解决问题的方法。
Like this one, after 10 or 20 years of waiting, you can use your experience, your knowledge, create new ways, and find faster ways to solve problems.
2.看见的是最重要的，坚持实践得出的方法南都：能不能谈一下您的学习、工作经历和故事，在不断学习的过程中，您觉得自己收获最大的是什么？钟南山：这个问题，我最先想到的答案是非典期间的故事。
What do you think you have most to gain from your continuous learning? Zhong Nan Shan: The first answer I came up with was the story of the SARS period.
觉得邓小平同志提到的，解放思想，实事求是，这对我们指导、收获很大。
Comrade Deng Xiaoping mentioned that we should emancipate our minds and seek truth from facts.
2003年时，我们遇到了一些不实的情况，在非典开始的时候，曾经有关部门认为病原体是一般的衣原体，很容易治疗。
In 2003, we encountered a number of false cases, when SARS began, the authorities thought the pathogen is common chlamydia, easy to treat.
但是我们用治疗衣原体的相关方案、方法治疗病人，发现一点效果都没有。
But we used the treatment of chlamydia related programmes, methods of treatment patients, found no effect.
我们还是本着实事求是的精神，以事实为依据，提出了不同意见。
Again, in a spirit of realism and on the basis of facts, we have put forward different views.
我觉得，在求知的过程中，看见的（实践过的）是最重要的。
It seems to me that what is seen (practiced) is the most important thing in the pursuit of knowledge.
正因为我们坚持自己的治疗方法，所以我们能够取得最低的病死率，减少了很多不必要的生命损失。
It is because we adhere to our own treatment that we are able to achieve the lowest fatality rate and reduce unnecessary loss of life.
3.与其相信权威，不如相信实践南都：对于即将复学的学生群体，您有什么样的寄语？钟南山：准确地说，我经过了至少七十几年的学习，我关于学习的最大体会就是，要学好基本功。
Instead of believing in authority, believe in the practice of NanDu: What kind of comments do you have for the group of students going back to schoolZhong Nan Shan: Exactly speaking, after more than seventy years of study, my greatest learning experience is to learn the basics well.
只有具备了最基本的知识以后，你才能够往上走。
Only when you have the most basic knowledge can you go up.
而在基本功里，学好语文最关键。
And in the basic skills, learning Chinese is the most important.
学好了语文才懂得如何对事情进行分析、总结、综合。
Only when you learn Chinese well can you know how to analyze, summarize and synthesize things.
我们在很多科研工作、科研领域中都需要有扎实的基本功，这尤为重要。
We need to have solid basic skills in many fields of scientific research and research, and this is particularly important.
其次就是要学会多问几个为什么。
The second is to learn to ask a few more why.
我们除了学习基本知识，还要有好奇心，经常去考虑一下：这个为什么是这样？或者这个跟事实（本质）有什么出入？正因为这样，我在整个工作过程中，以及这几次抗击冠状病毒的过程中，我都保持着一颗好奇心和敢于提为什么的精神。
Besides learning the basics and being curious, we often ask ourselves: Why is this so? Or is it any different from the truth? That is why I have remained curious and daring to ask why throughout my work and in the course of the fight against the coronavirus.
对于别人讲的东西，不见得要相信，关键要眼见为实。
Don't believe what other people say. The key is to see what is true.
以实践为师，相信自己的实践，比相信权威更加重要。
To practice as a teacher, to believe in their own practice, than to believe in authority more important.
