牛牛妈所在的医院虽然不是新冠病毒肺炎的定点收治医院，但从去年年底至今，呼吸内科从最初大的一个病区扩展到四个病区，一直超载运行。
Since the end of last year, the Department of Respiratory Medicine has expanded from an initially large area to four disease areas and has been overrun.
有的人是自己走进来的，离开的时候都没来得及见家人最后一面；有的人对这个世界充满热情和眷念，在生命最后几分钟还在视频……每一个故事，都让人满含泪水，每一个生命，都值得我们铭记。
Some people walk in on their own and leave without seeing their families for the last time. Others feel passionate and attached to the world, still video in the last few minutes of their lives... Every story is full of tears, every life worth remembering.
从绝望到希望，那些和牛牛妈插肩而过的生命，是此刻最真实的人世间。
From despair to hope, the lives of those who interlude with cattle and cattle and mothers are the most real people in the world at the moment.
一今时今日，疫情发源地“华南海鲜市场”已经是无人不知无人不晓的存在。
Today, the "South China Seafood Market," the birthplace of the epidemic, is well known.
就说我本人，其实也收治过跟华南海鲜市场有关的新冠病毒肺炎患者。
Speaking for myself, I have actually treated patients with Newcastle virus pneumonia related to the South China seafood market.
病人是位40多岁的中年女性，首先是她老公到华南海鲜市场买了一袋螃蟹，买螃蟹的过程中，他在市场里还转了一圈，可以说走了很长时间吧，年前采办年货嘛，在里面挑挑拣拣啥的。
The patient is a middle-aged woman in her 40s. First, her husband went to the South China seafood market to buy a bag of crabs. During the process, he also walked around the market.
回来之后，她老公没有任何症状，也没有发病。
After returning, her husband did not have any symptoms, nor did he get sick.
但是，这位家庭主妇接手了这袋螃蟹之后就开始发烧了，而且病情越来越重。
But the housewife took over the bag and had a fever, which got worse and worse.
门诊做了CT，我和同事根据影像特征判断她高度疑似新冠病毒肺炎，就这样收到了我所在的病区。
After a CT scan at the clinic, my colleagues and I judged her to be highly suspicious of New Crown Virus pneumonia, and thus received my ward.
ps，她是我最初接诊的4个重症感染患者之一。
PS, she was one of the first four patients I attended to with severe infection.
我当时就觉得疑窦重重——这个患者没有去过华南海鲜市场，她是怎么被感染上的呢？而她老公虽然去过华南，但却并没有感染……然后我就想到，不一定是一定要到华南海鲜市场才会染病，有可能接触会传染。
I was skeptical about how the patient, who had not been to the South China seafood market, got infected, and her husband, who had been to South China, did not get infected... and then I thought it might not be necessary to go to the South China seafood market to get infected.
她老公可能就是那种免疫力很强的人，就没有发病，但是他把病毒携带回家，传给了他老婆。
Her husband might have been one of those immune people who didn't get sick, but he took the virus home and passed it on to his wife.
那是在什么时候呢？才1月10号左右！官方的渠道还在强调没有证据证明病毒会人传人，所以我们只是对患者本人采取了隔离和治疗措施，没有特别地让她老公去隔离啥的。
When was that? Around January 10! Official sources were still stressing that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus, so we isolated and treated the patients themselves, without specifically having her husband isolate or anything.
说回这个病人，因为比较年轻，体质还可以，没有什么基础病，平常都在家做体力活的，加上心态比较放松，所以她在治疗过程中病情进展较慢，治疗效果也比较好。
Speaking of the patient, because relatively young, physique is OK, there is no basic disease, usually do physical work at home, coupled with a more relaxed mentality, so she progress slowly in the treatment process, treatment effect is better.
第一次核酸检测阴性，第二次检测呈阳性。
First negative nucleic acid test, second positive test.
既然确诊了，所以成功地转到了金银潭医院。
Now that he was diagnosed, he was successfully transferred to the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital.
整个过程中，她老公一直关注华南海鲜的信息，特别地焦虑。
Throughout the process, her husband has been paying attention to the South China seafood information, particularly anxious.
他老在问我为什么他老婆得病他不会得病，他自己为什么还没得病啥的，天天问这个为什么。
He kept asking me why his wife was ill. He didn't get sick. Why didn't he get sick or something? Every day he asked why.
我也就一直跟他保持着沟通交流。
I keep in touch with him all the time.
所以我也知道他到现在为止也是一直没发病。
So I know he hasn't had any illness so far.
我相信，如果他发病，他第一时间会给我打电话，因为他有我的手机号的。
I believe that if he gets sick, he will call me first because he has my cell phone number.
二再来讲一个广场舞大妈。
And then there's a square dancer.
大妈其实就住医院隔壁小区，我还记得她当时来的时候是自己走过来的，症状不算很严重的那种，氧饱和度身体体征都稳定，唯一不太好的就是她的胸部CT。
She actually lived in the neighborhood next door to the hospital, and I remember coming by herself when she came. The symptoms were not serious. The oxygen saturation was stable. The only thing not so good was her chest CT.
CT出来显示全肺累及，但还不是白肺，而是那种很淡的云雾状的磨玻璃影。
CT came out to show that the entire lung is involved, but not the white lung, but the kind of very light cloud-like glass grinding shadow.
我当时很重视这个病例，因为这个疾病的特点就是症状跟体征的不一致。
I took the case seriously because the disease was characterized by a discrepancy between symptoms and signs.
我第一时间跟她谈病重，给她把监护都上上去，可她还是觉得自己有点闷，有点憋。
The first time I talked to her about her serious illness and put her under supervision, but she still felt a little stuffy and pent up.
可能是对这个疾病的认识度非常有限，大妈每天几乎24小时不停地玩手机。
Perhaps the degree of awareness of the disease is very limited. She plays with her cell phone almost 24 hours a day.
怎么说呢，就是跟家人视频啊，跟自己广场舞的舞伴儿们聊天，干这些事儿。
What do you mean, video with your family, chatting with my partners in the square, doing all this.
我因为了解这个疾病，我就在她住院的第三天，赶紧安排复查了个CT。
Knowing about the disease, I immediately scheduled a CT scan on her third day in hospital.
妈呀！这一复查，肺基本上全白了。
Mum! The lungs are basically white from this review.
当时我看监护仪她的氧饱和度能够坚持到最高93左右，但是一动就会掉下去，所以我就赶紧跟她家人打电话告病危，然后她的老伴来了。
I looked at the monitor and she had oxygen saturation up to about 93, but then it fell, so I called her family to tell her she was dying, and then her wife came.
老头来了就说你们尽一切可能地救她吧，她一辈子从来没住过院，她刚刚还在外面跳广场舞，结果就这样发烧就得病。
When the old man arrived, he said, "Save her as much as you can. She has never lived in a hospital in her life.
我们都觉得不可能，她怎么这么好的体质都会得病，不太接受这个现实。
We all thought it impossible, how can she be so good physique will get sick, not accept this reality.
她唯一的女儿在境外，当时办不了签证回不了武汉，天天听我们跟她电话沟通病情。
Her only daughter is abroad, then can not get a visa back to Wuhan, listen to our daily telephone communication with her illness.
我跟家属说要做好心理准备，这个病进展会非常快，很多病人能扛过来，很多病人不明原因的就会突然加重，该用的药我们都会去用，该做的抢救我们都会去做，但有时候就是没办法。
I told my family I wanted to be prepared for the disease, it was going to go really fast, a lot of patients were going to be able to carry it, a lot of patients were going to suddenly get worse, we were going to use the drugs, we were going to do what we had to do, but sometimes there was nothing we could do.
大概是在住院第4天吧，大妈的氧饱和度急剧下降，我就安抚说你不要整天拿手机跟家人跟朋友视频聊天了，这会耗氧。
About the fourth day in the hospital, mom's oxygen saturation drops sharply, I soothed that you do not take the phone all day with family and friends video chat, it will consume oxygen.
但是她不听，感觉大妈是那种特别热心，也特别特别需要周围人关注的那种性格，不管什么事情，她都会想着跟身边联系的好友通知一声。
But she did not listen, feeling that she was the kind of person who was particularly warm-hearted and in need of special attention, and that whenever anything happened, she thought of notifying her good friends around her.
从住进来开始大妈就不要听医生，依从性很差。
She never listens to the doctor from the moment she comes in. She is very obedient.
导尿管上完之后，几分钟她就拔掉，受不了任何的痛苦。
After the catheter was finished, she pulled it out in a few minutes, unable to stand any pain.
让她吃东西，喝水干啥她不愿意，她要视频聊天，要把该说的话都说完。
She didn't want her to eat or drink. She wanted a video chat to finish what she was supposed to say.
她的老公跟我说她平时也是，碰到事情自己焦虑，然后把家人也搞焦虑。
Her husband told me that she, too, was anxious about things, and then worried about her family.
我很理解她，本来病也很重，从来没得过病的人肯定是很恐慌的。
I understand her very well, but she was also very ill, and people who have never been ill must have been frightened.
但是我跟她用的抗焦虑治疗也完全无效。
But the anti-anxiety treatments I used with her were completely ineffective.
住院第5天，大妈的血氧饱和度垮到了50，一天之内就从大概80几掉到了50。
On the fifth day of hospitalization, the oxygen saturation of the mother's blood collapsed to 50, from about 80 to 50 in one day.
我觉得情况很不妙，我就跟她家人通通打电话，告病危。
I felt so bad that I called her family and told her that she was dying.
这个病人一直到最后抢救，我都是从头到尾站在她旁边的。
I was standing next to her from beginning to end until the end of the patient's life.
在生命最后的那几分钟，大妈还在视频，还在视频。
In the last few minutes of her life, she was still video, still in the video.
我记得她是下午两点钟走的，之前她还在和她老公视频，监护仪上所有的指标都不好，血压往下掉，心率也在往下掉。
I remember her leaving at 2 p. m., she was still playing video with her husband, everything on the monitor was bad, her blood pressure was dropping and her heart rate was falling.
我就知道她已经到了最后的阶段，也就是上海中山医院重症医学科副主任钟鸣说的”炎症因子风暴“阶段，之后马上就是多脏衰。
I knew that she had reached the final stage of what Zhong Ming, deputy director of severe medicine at the Zhongshan Hospital in Shanghai, called the "inflammatory factor storm" phase.
可是我没有任何办法干预啊，等她大概视频完，没过多长时间，手机从手中啪地坠到地上，大妈就这样在我面前，走了。
But I did not have any way to intervene ah, when she probably finished video, not long after, the phone from the hand slapped to the ground, aunt in front of me, walked away.
那种绝望和无助，深深地打击着我，病人走了，我失声痛哭……我只记得那时候钟南山院士还没到武汉，那时候，整个世界还在一片祥和，很多同事还在“裸奔”。
That kind of despair and helplessness, deeply hit me, the patient left, I cried... I only remember the time when the academician Zhong Nan Shan did not arrive in Wuhan, when the whole world was still peaceful and many colleagues were still "streaking naked."
三一个大学的教授，来的时候显得特别焦虑。
A professor at Trinity University came with great anxiety.
因为感染很重，就是那种两个肺都已经几乎全白的那种，然后血氧饱和度只能维持在刚刚90。
Because the infection is severe, the kind where both lungs are almost completely white, the blood oxygen saturation can only be maintained at just 90.
我很重视他，我第一时间跟他的家属全部都沟通病情，他的两个儿子都跟我见了面。
I took him seriously. I first spoke to his family, and both of his sons met with me.
然后我说，你们家尽一切条件救救他吧，他的预后很不好，我们医生会尽力，你们家属也要配合，大概就是这样子。
Then I said, Your family will do whatever it takes to save him, his prognosis is bad, our doctor will do his best, your family will cooperate, that's about it.
能够住进来都很难，两个儿子都很感谢。
It was difficult to live in, and both sons were grateful.
我直接就跟他们说实话：做好心理准备，钱啊什么的都不需要，这个时候你们需要的是配合医生。
I'll just tell them the truth: be prepared mentally, money or anything. What you need at this point is to work with the doctor.
可是这个病人住进来之后，从头到尾都很焦虑。
But the patient was anxious from beginning to end when he came in.
他每天说话很吃力，但还是写纸条跟我们交流。
He talks a lot every day, but he writes notes and communicates with us.
感谢我们医护人员，你们一定要救我，我现在很难受……我和同事每天安抚他，全力干预和缓解他的焦虑情绪。
Thanks to our paramedics, you have to save me. I'm feeling terrible... and my colleagues and I soothe him every day, intervening and relieving his anxiety.
我就说你配合，我们一定会挺过来，这个病你自己也要有战胜它的意志力。
I said you cooperate, we will survive, this disease you have to have the will to overcome it.
我们有成功治好的例子，比你的病还要重。
We have examples of successful cures, more serious than your illness.
但这个病人表面淡定，内心恐惧，他每天的监测心率都在100左右，我们凭医生的直觉就觉得这个人情绪方面的因素太重了。
But the patient was calm and fearful, and his heart rate was around 100 per day. Our doctors instinctively assumed that this person's emotional state was too strong.
这个爹爹他其实没啥基础性疾病，但是进展实在太快。
This dad He's not really a basic disease, but he's making too much progress.
我跟他家属联系，两个儿子都来不了，说是也被感染了，给其它的医院收治了，只能电话和微信联系。
I contacted his family and both of my sons could not come, saying that they were infected, were admitted to other hospitals and had to communicate by telephone and by microphone.
但是要买什么药都很配合，包括营养品啊什么的，都是通过熟人和朋友送到医院来。
But everything from nutrition to medicine is sent to the hospital through acquaintances and friends.
这个病人很快就出现了ARDS也就是呼吸窘迫，然后到死的时候人还是清醒的。
The patient soon developed ARDS, or respiratory distress, and by the time he died he was awake.
最后几分钟就是活活憋死过去的，我们也用了很多的抢救设备，还是没有抢救过来。
The last few minutes are suffocating to death, we also used a lot of rescue equipment, or not rescued.
下班的时候，我和同事抱头痛哭。
At the end of the day, my colleagues and I cried.
面对新冠这种病魔，无论你是教授还是广场舞大妈，都是一样的无力。
In the face of the new crown this illness, whether you are a professor or a square dancer, are equally powerless.
四一位50出头的中年女性，入院情况就不太好——CT显示肺部的病变面积特别大，有高血压，然后还有慢性肾功能不全。
For four middle-aged women in their early 50s, admission was not so good - CT showed particularly large lung lesions, high blood pressure, and then chronic renal insufficiency.
氧饱和度也不稳定，只有80几到90，刚刚及格线。
Oxygen saturation is also unstable, only 80 to 90, just passing the grid.
我当时就觉得这个病人可能救不过来，然后我就联系她的家人。
I thought the patient might not be able to get over it, and then I contacted her family.
了解下来她的家人全部中招，都在各大医院住院，唯一的女儿怀孕了，还远在重庆。
Understand that her family are all admitted to hospitals, the only daughter pregnant, as far away as Chongqing.
那个时候武汉已经交通封锁，也不能回来，然后我就对这个病人不抱太大希望，心里想着这个病那么重，家人又不在身边，可能预后特别差。
Wuhan was blocked by traffic and could not come back, and then I didn't have much hope for the patient, thinking that the disease was so serious and the family was not around, and the prognosis could be especially bad.
没想到，她身在重庆的女儿在跟我电话沟通病情的过程中，深深地打动了我。
Unexpectedly, her daughter in Chongqing with me in the course of telephone communication, deeply moved me.
她跟我说她的难处，她说我现在还一个月就生了，我肯定赶不回来，我妈妈住院，我一切都拜托您，您一定要救她。
She told me of her difficulties; she said that I was only a month away, that I would not return, that my mother was in the hospital, and that I begged you for everything, and that you would save her.
我给您下跪，我录视频给您……反正救治的意愿特别强烈。
I kneel to you, I record video to you... anyway, the will to treat is particularly strong.
我当时又流泪了，从那一刻开始我改变了自己的心态。
I wept again, and from that moment on I changed my mind.
这个病人也是很奇怪，开始治疗之后病情并没有迅速恶化。
The patient, too, was surprised that the condition did not deteriorate rapidly after the start of treatment.
我感觉她自己其实做好了治不好的那种心理准备，看淡了生死，所以她无所谓。
I felt that she was actually prepared for the kind of psychological treatment, see light of life and death, so she does not matter.
她跟我说，你该怎么治你就怎么治我吧，反正我亲人都不在身边。
She said to me, you should treat you how to cure me, anyway my relatives are not around.
我都跟他们打好招呼了，见不了面也无所谓了。
I said hello to them. It doesn't matter if I can't meet them.
但是我想着她女儿对她那么的尽心，我就还是极力地每天给她鼓劲。
But I thought about how dedicated her daughter was to her, and I tried to cheer her up every day.
在大概住院一个星期之后，核酸检测就来了，第一次是阴性，第二次的话报了阳性。
After about a week in hospital, a nucleic acid test came, negative for the first time and positive for the second.
结果报阳性之后她运气很好，第一批转金银潭的就有她。
She was lucky to be the first to turn gold and silver into gold and silver.
当时她的血氧饱和度也能够维持90以上，这个人挺过来了，现在在金银潭那边已经处于好转期了。
She was able to maintain a blood oxygen saturation of more than 90, this person survived, now in the gold and silver pool on the other side of the stage of improvement.
她的女儿自然是非常非常地感谢我，每天跟我微信，然后也跟我发捐赠，在医疗物资最为匮乏的阶段，她给我所在的单位捐了很多口罩和防护服。
Her daughter naturally thanked me very much, wrote to me every day, and then donated to me, donating many masks and protective clothing to my unit at a time when medical supplies were most scarce.
到现在，她还在日复一日的地发朋友圈募捐。
She still raises money day after day in her circle of friends.
五还有一个病人，是两个儿子一起送过来的，其中一个儿子好像也是一个什么领导之类的，穿着打扮都很官气，说话也很讲礼貌非常客气。
CHAPTER V A Sick, sent together by two sons, one of whom seemed to be some sort of a leader, dressed up, and polite, very polite.
病人70出头，但是已经患上老年痴呆，耳朵也聋，再加上思维啊什么的都不正常。
The patient was in his early 70s, but was suffering from Alzheimer's disease, deafness in the ears, and an abnormality of thought and stuff.
送来的时候情况很不好，病情很重，肺部感染面积很大，又是老年人。
It arrived in very bad condition, very serious, with a large lung infection area and an elderly person.
我肯定是按照程序告病危，该积极治疗、抢救啥的都搞了。
I must be in accordance with the procedure to report critical illness, active treatment, rescue what have been done.
除了疾病本身，这种老年痴呆对于我们的护理也是极大的挑战。
In addition to the disease itself, this form of dementia is a great challenge to our care.
大家都知道，隔离病房的病人吃喝拉撒都要由护士来做，因为没有留陪的家属。
As we all know, the isolation ward patients eat and drink Lazarus are done by nurses, because there are no accompanying family members.
也不可能让家属守在里面，怕感染。
It's impossible for family members to stay inside for fear of infection.
所以碰上这种病人，我们护士的护理量成倍增加——这个爹爹是个聋子，又是个老年痴呆，无法沟通，让他吃饭都是强行喂。
So when we met this patient, our nurse's care multiplied - the father was deaf and senile, unable to communicate, and forced to eat.
然后这个爹爹又听不懂，又犟，干啥他都要自己搞。
Then this father again does not understand, also stubbornly, does what he wants to do by himself.
病那么重，他还要自己上厕所，从床上摔下来一次，最后是我和三个护士一起把他抬到床上去的。
He was so ill that he had to go to the bathroom himself, fall off the bed, and finally I took him to bed with three nurses.
就这样折腾，每天折腾，所以他病情也得不到很好的控制。
Just toss and toss every day, so his illness is not well under control.
几天下来，有位护士姐妹说她实在受不了，她要累倒了，然后我没有办法，只有打电话给家属。
A few days later, a sister nurse said she couldn't stand it. She was tired, and then I had no choice but to call my family.
我说我求求你们，你们家留一个人在病房守着您父亲。
I said I beg you to leave a man in your house to watch over your father in the ward.
我们给你做好全程的防护，你也穿防护服进去，尽量不让你感染到。
We will protect you throughout the journey, and you will wear protective clothing to keep you from getting infected.
因为我们护士姐妹实在是顾不了，都已经病了一个了。
Because we nurses and sisters really can not care, have been sick one.
两个儿子，其中一个从家里赶过来了，赶来了以后，就一直在一个角落的凳子上坐着，在那儿发抖。
The two sons, one of whom had come from his own house, had been sitting on a stool in a corner, trembling.
然后我就问他，我说你怎么了？他说我怕，我怕自己被传染。
Then I asked him, I said what happened to you? He said I was afraid, I was afraid of being infected.
然后我就做他的工作，我说我都在这儿工作这么长时间了，我们没有被感染，就是因为有防护呀。
And then I did his job, and I said I've been working here for so long that we weren't infected because we had protection.
没有防护，你在外面也会被别人感染了。
Without protection, you would be infected outside.
你在这儿我们可以给你单独搞一个床，把你和你父亲隔开，就是交流方面，你们尽量配合一下：能够让爹爹听您的，因为您是他在旁边唯一的亲人。
Here we can make a separate bed for you, and separate you from your father, that is, for communication, and you shall do your best to make papa listen to you, for you are his only relative by the wayside.
他儿子答应了，但最后也只呆了几个小时，还是给吓跑了。
His son agreed, but in the end he stayed only a few hours before he was scared away.
他说他不干，他坚决不干，所以这样的大难度护理还是留给了我们医生护士。
He said he wouldn't do it, and he was determined not to do it, so it was left to us, the doctors and nurses.
当然，这种情况我们也完全理解。
Of course, we fully understand that.
在疾病面前，我们不要太去考验人性，我们可以去感慨90岁的老母亲连着5天守护64岁的儿子，但也不需要去责怪临阵脱逃的儿子。
Instead of trying too hard on humanity in the face of disease, we can sigh that our 90-year-old mother has been keeping an eye on her 64-year-old son for five days without blaming him for his escape.
这个病人在住院后的第十天，还是走了。
The patient left the hospital ten days later.
没有能够挽救生命，他儿子也能接受，也表示理解。
His son accepted and understood that there was nothing he could do to save his life.
六1月20日,钟南山院士首次披露武汉有14名医护人员感染新型冠状病毒，后来披露的情况说这起交叉感染出现在脑神经外科，而不是在传染科。
June 20, Zhong Nan Shan academician disclosed for the first time that 14 medical personnel in Wuhan were infected with the new coronavirus. Later, it was revealed that the cross-infection occurred in neurosurgery, not in the department of infectious disease.
在我们医院，也有医生因为做手术被感染，他是我接诊的第一例本院职工新冠肺炎患者。
In our hospital, there are doctors who have been infected because of surgery, he is the first case of my hospital staff New Crown Pneumonia.
这位男同事跟我年龄差不多，高高胖胖的，我说你这么强的体质你也被感染，你是怎么感染的？他就开玩笑：射线吃多了呗，对自己的免疫还是有杀伤力的，所以我这么胖还是被感染。
The male colleague is about my age, very fat, I said you are so strong physique you were infected, how did you infect? He joked: the rays eat too much, or their immunity is still destructive, so I was so fat or infected.
然后我看了一下他的CT片，感染面积不大，就只一点点。
Then I took a look at his CT scan and the infection was small, just a little bit.
于是我跟他说行，你就到我这儿隔离治疗，保护你家人，你搞几天我们争取把你搞好，快点出院。
So I told him yes, you're gonna come here to quarantine and protect your family, And you're gonna spend a couple of days And we're gonna get you ready and get out of the hospital.
为了给他鼓劲，我还说你这么强悍的年轻人肯定能好，现在网上说年轻人治好的都很多的，你没问题。
In order to encourage him, I also said that you so strong young people will be good, now that the Internet said that the young people cured a lot, you are no problem.
同时住院的还有两个护士，都是跟他一组的，照顾同一个手术病人的两个护士，都是被同一个病人感染的。
Also hospitalized were two nurses in his group, two nurses caring for the same patient, both infected by the same patient.
三个人同一天被我收进来。
The three men were collected by me the same day.
这个不同科室的同事跟我很熟，我就跟他说你放心，你到了我们科你就安全了，我们这是最专业的。
The colleagues in this different section are very familiar with me, I told him you can rest assured that you will be safe when you come to our office, we are the most professional.
要是对我的治疗不满意，你也要跟我商量，我们一起面对疾病。
If you are not satisfied with my treatment, you have to discuss with me, we face the disease together.
他也表现出很有信心的样子，但是心里其实很害怕，因为毕竟不是搞呼吸专业的。
He also appeared to be very confident, but he was really afraid because he was not a breathing professional after all.
当时还可以有声有色地开玩笑，但是这位仁兄接下来的情况很不妙，大概在住院的第九天，第十天的样子他进展到呼吸困难。
It was a colourful joke, but the next day was bad for the brother, who had progressed to breathlessness on the ninth and tenth days of hospitalization.
复查CT，感染面积确实增大了，然后告病危。
Review CT, the area of infection did increase, and then reported critical illness.
第二天，医院内部被感染的病人越来越多，就组织全院开辟了第二个呼吸内科，专门收治本院感染医务人员，所以他就被转到了呼吸二病区，另外的医生接手了。
The next day, as the number of patients infected inside the hospital increased, a second department of respiratory medicine was set up to treat the hospital's infected staff, so he was transferred to the respiratory area and the other doctors took over.
虽然不做主治医生了，但我一直在电脑上关注他的病情进展。
Although not a attending doctor, but I have been on the computer to follow his progress.
呼吸困难，血氧饱和度站不住，肺部感染面积进一步扩大，转金银潭又特别困难……然后他的家人就都在网上发诉求求救命。
With difficulty breathing, oxygen saturation unable to stand, the area of lung infection further expanded, gold and silver pool transfer is particularly difficult... then his family members on the Internet to call for help.
我当时特别不能理解，三个病人同时收进来啊，他是唯一一个大胖子，居然进展最快，另外两个瘦瘦的护士症状轻多了，治疗之后都快出院了，怎么他搞成这样了？但是一看他的血象，淋巴细胞几乎接近为零了！所以他还是免疫系统太弱了，免疫系统没有跟上来。
He was the only fat man who was making the fastest progress, and the other two skinny nurses were getting out of the hospital soon after treatment! But at first sight his blood lymphocytes were close to zero! So his immune system was too weak to follow.
最后，通过院方的努力，我这个同事还是成功地转到了金银潭。
Finally, through the efforts of the hospital, my colleague succeeded in moving to the gold and silver pool.
他后期在金银潭的重症监护室里呆了很久，我一直关注他，跟他保持联系，目前听说是已经脱下了呼吸机，处于好转期了。
He spent a long time in the intensive care unit of Gold and Silver Pool. I watched him and kept in touch with him. I heard that he had taken off the ventilator and was in remission.
七我接诊的最年轻的一例病人，三十出头。
CHAPTER VII THE EYEST CASES I HAVE IN THIRTY YEARS.
拿着他的CT片子，我不敢相信他肺上的感染灶会有那么多！问病史，我也不知道他是怎么得的，他自己也不知道，反正就是发烧了，CT片子出来超多的感染灶。
With his CT scan, I can't believe there's a lot of infection in his lungs! Ask history, I don't know how he got it, he doesn't know, it's fever anyway, CT scans come out too many infection focus.
然后当时的媒体报道都还在说老年人发病多，有基础病的发病多一些，但是我这个病人他很年轻啊。
Then the media reported that the elderly have more cases of basic diseases, but I this patient he is very young.
当时我跟他开了阿比多尔，用了以后效果还可以，马上退烧了。
At that time I opened Abidor with him, after the use of the effect can also be immediately reduced to fever.
当时也不知道是不是别的原因，可能主要还是体质免疫力比较强吧。
At that time also did not know is not other reason, perhaps is the constitution immunity is stronger.
当时我查房很开心，我就说你有希望，你现在给了我信心，我接诊的都是老弱病残，就你是年轻人，我说你可以治好。
I had a good time checking out the house, I said you had hope, you gave me confidence, I treated the sick, the old, the sick, only you are a young man, and I said you could heal.
听到我这句话之后，他马上把他的药递给我一盒。
As soon as he heard this, he handed me his medicine.
他说，医生，你要好好的。
He said, Doctor, you have to be fine.
你看我这么年轻，连我都中招，你也要注意，你天天接触我们这些病人，你也吃这个药吧，这个药的说明书上写着有预防的作用。
You see I am so young, even I have to pay attention to the fact that you are in daily contact with us patients, you also take this medicine, the prospectus of this medicine has a preventive effect.
不知道为什么，听到这句话，我眼泪一下子就出来了。
Do not know why, hear this sentence, my tears suddenly came out.
我肯定不愿意接受了，但是他说他愿意，他说他自己快好了，吃不了那么多，他说一定要给我吃，要不然我救不了他，他希望我一直好好的，可以去救更多人。
I would certainly not accept it, but he said he would, he said he was almost ready, he could not eat so much, he said that I must eat, or I could not save him, he hoped that I had been good enough to save more people.
这个病人昨天出院了，各方面指标都达到了出院标准。
The patient was discharged from the hospital yesterday and all the criteria were met.
八这次的新冠病毒特别容易出现聚集性疫情，动辄就是全家”中招“，而且又迟迟得不到确诊；所以我们这些临床一线的医生一直反复呼吁，建议把CT影像特征纳入诊断标准，不要光看咽拭子试剂盒，直到最近才得到认可。
The new strain of the new cap virus is particularly prone to aggregation, and is often a "catch-all" and delayed diagnosis; so we clinicians have repeatedly called for CT imaging features to be included in the diagnostic criteria, rather than just looking at swabs and kits, until recently accepted.
接下来我想讲的是一位闺蜜同事，一位本院的消化内科医生全家感染的故事。
Next I would like to tell the story of a girl colleague, a hospital digester whose entire family has been infected.
最先发病的是她老爸，一个普普通通的50多岁的中年男人，体质偏胖，没有什么基础病，但是来看的时候病情已经很严重了，主要是因为在家里等床位拖了太长时间。
Her father, a plain, middle-aged man in his fifties, was obese and had no underlying ailments, but came to see him seriously, mainly because he had waited too long for his bed at home.
不幸的是，还没等老爸住进医院，我这位同事就发现自己感染了；她的小孩才小学二年级，也中招了；接下来轮到她弟弟，至此全家无一幸免。
Unfortunately, before my father was admitted to the hospital, my colleague found himself infected; her child had just enrolled in his second year of primary school; it was her brother's turn, and the whole family was spared.
然后只能拼命找床位：她弟弟在武昌那边找了一家医院住了进去；她自己也得隔离，只能把小孩托给其他的亲戚朋友照顾；病情最重的是爸爸，我同事就找自己工作的医院，找领导，最后通过自己所在的科主任协调到一张床。
Then she had to desperately find a bed: her brother went to a hospital in Wuchang; she had to isolate the baby and leave it in the care of other relatives and friends; father was the worst affected, so my colleague went to the hospital where he worked, looked for a leader and finally coordinated a bed through her section chief.
请注意，仅此一张床位，这也就意味着我同事如果自己住进来，她老爸也就没有机会收治——这个时候，她很坚持也很淡定：我不要紧，以我爸爸的命为主，我的病不算重，自己在家治。
Please note that this single bed alone means that my co-worker would have no chance to be admitted if he lived here - and she insisted on this point as well: I don't matter, my father's life is the mainstay, I'm not too sick to treat myself at home.
所以，我同事的老爸就成了我的住院病人。
So my colleague's dad became my inpatient.
他肺部感染很重，血氧饱和度一直不正常，生命体征也不稳定，整个过程中这个同事对她老爸非常非常地尽心，几乎是完全不顾自己的身体，每天都跟医院跟我打电话，用最好的药，争取机会把她爸爸转到金银潭或者其它接收重症的医院。
His lungs were badly infected, his blood oxygen saturation was abnormal, and his vital signs were erratic. Throughout the process, the co-worker was very, very attentive to her father, almost completely oblivious to his own body, phoning me every day with the best medicine, trying to get her father transferred to a gold and silver pool or other critically ill hospital.
我也尽一切努力去安抚她的焦虑情绪，去宽慰她。
I did everything I could to assuage her anxiety and soothe her.
我说你这样子天天焦虑，对你的病和你爸爸的病，都没有好处。
I say you worry every day like this, and it's no good for your illness or your father's.
我同事全家的治疗方案基本都是我在做，我每天都在跟她沟通，小孩怎么治，她弟弟怎么治。
My colleague's family's treatment plan is basically I am doing, I am communicating with her every day, the child how to treat, her younger brother how to treat.
她弟弟的接诊的那个医院条件有限，主治医生也只能及时地找我沟通调整治疗方案。
The hospital where her brother was admitted was limited and the attending physician could only contact me in time to adjust the treatment plan.
加上我跟这位同事感情特别深，这些天真是眼泪都流干了，我根本接受不了这种事实。
Coupled with my deep feelings with this colleague, these naive tears are running dry, I simply can not accept this fact.
连医生的家庭都是这个样子，何况一般的老百姓呢，老百姓不懂医怎么办？中途，我们试图给她爸爸做高流氧治疗，可是病人不耐受，真的是很可怜，你们可能没见过那种样子——一直喘一直憋，戴着面罩张口呼吸，就像一条刚刚从水里面捞上来的鱼……好在，她自己按照我的治疗方案，在家里居家隔离和吃药，没有打针，自己的病已经慢慢在好转；好在，她老爸从住院到现在也坚持一周了，病情暂时没有进展和恶化。
Even the doctor's family is like this, not to mention the ordinary people, people do not know how to do? Halfway, we tried to give her father high-flow oxygen treatment, but the patient is really intolerable, you may not have seen that - kept breathing and panting at home.
当然，也没有好转的迹象；接下来怎么样，还真的很难说。
Of course, there is no sign of improvement; it is really hard to tell what will happen next.
稍微啰嗦几句，我个人认为，即便配备更高级的生命支持系统，譬如ECMO，也并不是所有的重症新冠病毒患者都能抢救过来。
In my opinion, even with more advanced life support systems, such as ECMO, not all patients with ICV can be saved.
因为这个疾病跟人体的免疫有关系，如果免疫系统跟不上，再好的生命支持也救不过来，有的病人甚至都拖不到上ECMO那个阶段。
Because the disease is linked to the body's immune system, no amount of life support can help if the immune system doesn't keep up, and some patients can't even get to ECMO.
但就算是上了ECMO，最后多脏衰了，你再用生命支持也只是延长一段时间的生命，最终还是逆转不了。
But even with ECMO, you end up dirty and frail, and your life support can only be extended for a while, and it won't be reversed.
所以，我们的治疗原则就是让肺得到一段时间的休息，同时确保休息期间不增加一些细菌感染的合并症。
Therefore, our treatment principle is to give the lung a period of rest, while ensuring that the rest period does not increase some bacterial infection complications.
那么，如果在这段休息期内病人自身的免疫系统跟上来了，病毒就会被攻克。
If, then, the patient's own immune system catches up during this break, the virus will be defeated.
从这个角度讲，药物只是一方面，真的只是一方面。
In this sense, drugs are only one aspect, really only one.
现在大家都在讲抗病毒的药已经进入临床三期，也有传言说的特别神奇，但是抗病毒始终是一个世界性难题。
Now everyone is talking about antiviral drugs has entered the third phase of clinical, there are rumors that the special magic, but anti-virus has always been a worldwide problem.
我觉得既需要保持希望，但也要做好长期艰苦作战的准备。
I feel the need to keep hope alive, but also to be ready to fight long and hard.
【最后】从最初的困惑和愤懑，到惊慌伴随的无助，再到绝望之后的崩溃，我和我的同事们用汗水和着泪水走到了当下。
From initial confusion and anger to panic and helplessness to the collapse of despair, my colleagues and I have come to this moment with sweat and tears.
最焦虑的时候，是重病人不断增多，但是物资、设备和人手都跟不上，眼睁睁的干着急；最绝望的时候，是不停的有患者停止呼吸，是一个个同事接连倒下，收满了整个病区；最振奋的时候，是钟南山院士说出那句”肯定的，有人传人现象“，直到那一刻，我才看到了希望。
The most anxious moments are when the number of seriously ill people keeps increasing, but supplies, equipment and manpower cannot keep up with them, and the most desperate times are when patients stop breathing, colleagues fall down one after another and fill the whole area.
昨天，那个被称为”吹哨人“的同行走了，全国人民都说他是英雄，但我和我身边的同事们都知道，他并不是什么英雄，他只是出于职业的敏感和良知，在第一时间提醒同事和亲友，但为什么我们每个人昨晚都泪洒衣襟，彻夜难眠？因为如人饮水，因为感同身受。
Yesterday, the so-called "whistle-blower" walked, the whole nation said he was a hero, but I and my colleagues around me know that he is not a hero. He just reminds colleagues and friends immediately out of professional sensitivity and conscience.
我们始终坚信，在党中央国务院的坚强领导下，在全国人民的共同努力下，我们一定能赢得最后的胜利。
We always firmly believe that under the firm leadership of the State Council of the CPC Central Committee and with the joint efforts of the people of the whole country, we will surely win the final victory.
夜已深，路正长，擦干眼泪，让我们一起加油。
The night is deep, the road is long, wipe away tears, let us refuel together.
