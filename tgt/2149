日常的平淡生活在如今成为奢侈1月23日早上6点，家住武汉市江岸区的徐哲，被连续不断的手机振动声吵醒。
Xu Zhe, who lives in the Jiangan district of Wuhan, was woken up by the continuous vibration of his mobile phone at 6 a.m. on January 23.
各大新闻APP都推送了“武汉封城”的新闻，时隔1个月，徐哲仍然记得那天早上6点钟小区附近二环线上嘈杂的车流声，“我震惊了一小会儿，就立刻想到要去超市采购物资。
Every major news APP pushed the news of Wuhan Sealing City, and a month later Xu Zhe still remembered the noisy traffic on the Second Ring Line near his neighborhood at 6 o'clock that morning.
”早上6点的武汉已经苏醒，但大型超商还没有开门营业，徐哲立刻穿好衣服去离家最近的24小时便利店采购，可供选择的货品并不多，他快速地买了6袋速冻水饺、2袋速冻汤圆、8桶泡面，回家放置好食物后，就急匆匆地开车去单位上班。
Wuhan had woken up at 6: 00 a.m., but the big supermarket hadn't opened yet, so Xu dressed up and went shopping at the nearest 24-hour convenience store.
如今，武汉封城已31天，徐哲家里的粮食储备已捉襟见肘，交通管制、小区封闭后，怎么买菜成为每一个武汉及周边城市居民的日常生活难题，疫情期间，他们的日常生活物资供应是否充足，成为舆论热议的焦点。
Now, Wuhan has been closed 31 days, Xuzhe family grain reserves have been stretched, traffic control, the closure of the community, how to buy vegetables become the daily life of every Wuhan and surrounding urban residents, during the epidemic, their daily supplies of adequate supplies has become the focus of heated public opinion.
买菜难1月23日，武汉宣布自当日上午10点起“封城”，随后，市内禁止公共交通，紧接着私人交通也被禁止。
Wuhan on January 23 announced that from 10 a.m. on the same day "closed the city," and then public transport, immediately following the ban on private transport.
除了医护人员和病人群体的出行问题，健康人群解决日常生活需求也成了难题。
In addition to the travel of medical personnel and patient groups, healthy people to meet the needs of daily life has become a challenge.
2月15日凌晨，武汉明确小区封闭管理措施，根据湖北省人民政府官网消息称，城乡所有村组、社区、小区、居民点实行24小时最严格的封闭式管理。
According to the official website of the People's Government of Hubei Province, all village groups, communities, small areas and population centres in urban and rural areas are under the strictest 24-hour closed management.
严管住户外出，药品和生活必需生活物品等可采取集中采购配送等方式进行。
Strict household out, medicines and life necessities and other means of centralized procurement and distribution.
物流停滞、交通管制、政策每天都在发生变化。
Logistics stagnation, traffic control, policies are changing every day.
徐哲家与救治新冠肺炎患者第一批定点医院——武汉市汉口医院仅一街之隔。
Xu Zhe-jia and the first designated hospitals for the treatment of Xinguan pneumonia patients - Wuhan Hankou Hospital is only one street apart.
距离他家1.5公里左右有中百仓储、永旺等大型超市，周边1公里内还有几家其他小型超市，但营业时间普遍缩短，也对客流量进行限制，有的超市一次只允许进入50人，超市门外排起了长龙一样的队伍，让他不敢靠近。
About 1.5 kilometers from his home, there are large supermarkets such as Zhong100 Warehousing and Yongwang, and a few other small supermarkets within 1 kilometer of his neighborhood. However, the opening hours are generally shorter and there are restrictions on the flow of passengers, with some supermarkets allowing only 50 people at a time and long queues outside the supermarkets.
“从封城到现在，我没有吃到过肉类，基本以米饭面条作为主要能量来源，而速冻水饺也成为硬通货，隔3到4天才敢吃1次，因为舍不得吃，冰箱里不剩几袋了。
"I haven't had meat since the end of the city, basically rice noodles as the main source of energy, and frozen dumplings have become hard currency and are eaten three to four days apart because there are not many bags left in the fridge.
”徐哲对《中国新闻周刊》讲述。
Xu Zhe told China News Weekly.
所有的普通人，在准备不充分的情况下，被卷入了储备生活物资的“战争”中，电商APP运力不足，每晚10点的“抢小哥”大战，让人胆战心惊，既考验网速也考验手速，大部分人很难成功，不会使用智能手机、不会上网的老年人，则更加无助。
All ordinary people, unprepared, are caught up in the "war" of hoarding supplies, with APP capacity running low, and the 10: 00 pm "Big Brother" war is frightening, testing both the speed of the Internet and the speed of the hand. Most people have a hard time succeeding.
电商运力不足让很多抢菜成功的人也很难高兴起来，“我听一位邻居在微信群里抱怨，她有幸在网上抢到了菜，但是却没有配送人员，跑腿费加价至100元依然没有人接单。
"I heard a neighbor complaining in a small crowd that she was lucky enough to grab the food on the Internet, but she didn't have a delivery person, and the running errands went up to $100 without a warrant.
”徐哲说。
"said Xu Zhe.
同样住在武汉市区的林娜也在担忧，“我每天都在担心明天还有没有菜吃，明天快递小哥还接不接单，孩子的口粮怎么办？老人的药怎么办？”林娜的小区允许一家每三天可以出门一次，但是由于她家附近的超商只跟社区对接不跟个人对接，无法购物，“一家人要买的东西太多了，车也不能开，一个人怎么能拿得动呢？”社区工作压力陡增武汉各社区情况不同，差异极大。
Linna, who also lives in Wuhan, worries, "I worry every day about whether there will be food tomorrow, but tomorrow the courier will not take the order. What about the children's rations?" Linna's neighborhood allows families to go out every three days.
有的小区跟超商直接对接，组建微信群帮助业主团购买菜，但是有的小区，社区工作人员人手不足，工作压力陡增，照顾到所有的居民，是一件不可能完成的任务。
Some communities and super-business direct docking, the formation of micro-groups to help owners to buy vegetables, but in some communities, community workers understaffed, the work pressure increased dramatically, to cover the entire population, is an impossible task.
2月22日晚，一段武汉嫂子在小区业主群里实力吐槽小区封闭管理后，社区和超市的“套餐制”购买方案不合理、配送物资价格贵等问题的视频登上微博热搜，引发大量讨论。
Feb. 22, Wuhan sister-in-law in a small group of owners in the strength of the district closed management, the community and supermarket "package system" purchase program unreasonable, distribution materials expensive video board Weibo hot search, generated a lot of discussion.
据南方都市报报道，目前该社区已经改进工作方法，“从23日起，居民自主上报所需生活物资，之后由社区统一代购。
The Southern Metropolis Daily reported that the community has improved its work methods, "from 23 onwards, residents reported their own needs for living materials, then the community unified purchase.
”徐哲也加了很多团购买菜的微信群，他在隔壁小区的微信群和其他业主一起团购了一大袋蔬菜，领菜点在小区门口300米，报预留名字就可以领走。
Xu Zhe has added groups of microcredits to the group that buys vegetables, and in the neighborhood next door he buys a large bag of vegetables with dishes 300 metres in front of the neighborhood, allowing them to be collected with their names reserved.
在封闭小区前，徐哲小区的生活物资采买基本靠居民自行采购，“社区工作者人手严重不足，十几人的社区居委会工作人员要负责所管辖片区内的几个小区内的大几千户居民；另一方面，小区物业责任心不够，存在不作为的情况，直至武汉市政府下发通知要求封闭小区不准人员外出，物业人员这才被动地进行蔬菜等物资的统一团购。
"Community workers are seriously understaffed. On the other hand, the community housing committee workers are responsible for a few small districts within their jurisdiction. On the other hand, the community property is not responsible enough, there is inaction, until Wuhan Municipal Government issued a notice to prohibit people from going out, property personnel passively engaged in vegetable and other materials.
”家住宜昌市长阳县的李东阳自1月21日回家后，就再也没有出过门。
Li Dongyang, who lives in Changyang county, Ichang, has not been outside since returning home on January 21.
1月25日，宜昌市封城，次日，长阳县也封锁了市区和各乡镇的通道，公交停运。
January 25, Yichang City closed the city, the next day, Changyang County also blocked the city and towns of the passageway, public transport stopped.
1月29日，李东阳居住的小区开始严格管控，大门上锁，门口由门卫看守，进出须登记，测体温，除了工作人员和一线抗疫工作者外，其他人不允许随意外出，小区统一建立了微信群，居民的生活物品需求，统一上报，由小区工作人员联系超市进行配送。
On 29 January, the district where Li Dong-yang lives began to be strictly controlled, with locked doors, doormen guarding them, access subject to registration, temperature control, no one except staff and first-line anti-epidemic workers allowed to go out at will, the community unified set up micro-credit groups, residents' needs for living goods, unified reporting, by district staff contact supermarkets for distribution.
封城后，李东阳通过小区，采购过一次蔬菜和鸡蛋，“价格较平时稍贵一点。
After sealing the city, Li Dongyang through the community, once purchased vegetables and eggs, "the price is a little more expensive than usual.
”小区封闭后，李东阳小区住户里的物资，由小区工作人员统一采购，住户只需下楼取回。
"After the closure of the residential area, Li Dongyang residential materials, by the district staff unified procurement, households only need to get back downstairs.
李东阳是幸运的，社区工作人员认真负责，连独居老人都尽全力照顾，“我们小区工作人员态度很好，工作用心，对小区内手机使用不熟练的老人，很有耐心，还两次为所有住户赠送水果蔬菜，特别体贴。
Li Dongyang is fortunate, the community workers are responsible, even the elderly living alone do their best to care for, "our neighborhood staff attitude, hard work, the use of mobile phones in the small areas of the elderly, very patient, but also twice for all households fruit and vegetables, particularly considerate.
目前外卖已经全面停止，统一由各社区负责配送，配送物资只有基本的食材，米面油，蔬菜，肉类，其他食品已经不供应了。
At present, take-out has been completely stopped, unified distribution by the communities, only basic food materials, rice noodle oil, vegetables, meat, other food supplies have been no longer available.
”恩施市来凤县的社区工作人员张晓钰从市里1月26日凌晨1点封城后，就一直在工作岗位上参加疫情排查工作，吃住都在单位，至今没有时间去超市为家里采买生活物资，“乡里的生活物资由我们统一配送，无论是干部还是居民都非常配合，为早日结束疫情做自己力所能及的事。
"Zhang Xiaoyu, a community worker in Enshi's Laifeng county, has been at work since the city closed at 1: 00 a.m. on January 26 to take part in the epidemic situation, eat and live in the workplace, has not had time to go to the supermarket to buy household goods.
”特殊时期的一日三餐徐哲家里的一日三餐目前比较“单调”，“早饭基本以开水冲燕麦或者煮汤圆为主；午饭则尽可能让自己吃饱一些，主要以米饭为主，有时蒸两碗米饭配上拌饭酱，再炒一个小青菜，有时想换换口味了，就蒸米饭后挑点绿叶菜加个鸡蛋，做两碗蛋炒饭；晚饭则是经常用青菜和火腿肠下两碗挂面吃。
"Three meals a day in a special period Xu Zhe's home is" monotonous "at present." Breakfast is based on boiling oatmeal or boiled dumplings, while lunch is mostly cooked with rice, sometimes steamed rice with rice sauce and a small vegetable dish.
”李东阳家里则因年货储备充足，以及平日里有储备生活用品的习惯，家里肉类存量充足，只需采购蔬菜即可，“目前早上一般煮面条或蒸馒头，中午和晚上一般炒个蔬菜或炒个肉。
Li Dongyang's family, with ample reserves of new year goods and the usual habit of stocking up on daily necessities, has plenty of meat in the house and can simply purchase vegetables.
但是蔬菜的种类不多，基本就是白菜、土豆、萝卜、莴笋等常见蔬菜。
But the vegetable kind is not many, basically is cabbage, potato, radish, lettuce and so on common vegetable.
”绿叶蔬菜易腐，不可长期储存，因此需要经常购买，但是徐哲对于下一次出门买菜，并没有认真想过，“我只是想把这些来之不易的蔬菜、鸡蛋省着点吃，尽量吃的时间久一些，这样就可以避免再一次出门，每出门一次都要面临着一次巨大的风险。
Green leafy vegetables are perishable and cannot be stored for long periods of time, so Xu Zhe doesn't think seriously about buying vegetables next time around. "I just want to save on these hard-won vegetables and eggs and eat them for as long as I can so I can avoid going out again and face a huge risk every time I go out.
”封城后，担心聚集风险的徐哲，只硬着头皮去过一次大型超市，“超市内的情况跟我想象的差不多，放食品的货架空了不少，冰柜里什么都不剩了，没有速冻产品，我想可能是还没来得及补货吧。
After the city was closed, Xu Zhe, worried about gathering risk, went to a large supermarket. "Things in the supermarket are about what I expected, the shelves were empty, the freezers were empty, there was no quick-frozen product, and I thought there might be time to restock it.
泡面已经没有整箱的了，只有零零散散的几袋。
There was no longer a whole box of noodles, just a few scattered bags.
我拿了货架上仅剩的几袋挂面，又挑了7瓶各类品牌的拌饭酱和3罐午餐肉罐头。
I took the only sacks of noodles left on the shelf and picked out seven more bottles of mixed-rice paste and three cans of canned luncheon meat.
”小区封闭管理之前，徐哲戴着口罩、护目镜、帽子、手套，全副武装地去楼下便利店补货，他买到了3袋汤圆、4罐拌饭酱、60个鸡蛋。
Before the neighborhood closed, Xu Zhe, armed with a mask, goggles, hat and gloves, went downstairs to the convenience store to replenish his stock.
能买到鸡蛋让徐哲觉得非常惊喜，“现在鸡蛋是仅次于肉类的稀罕物，我想就算一天吃2个鸡蛋，也够我们家吃一个月了，那天晚上我给在山东老家的父母打了个电话，开心地告诉他们我买到了鸡蛋。
Now eggs are second only to meat. I think even two eggs a day will be enough for our family for a month. That night I called my parents in Shandong Province and happily told them that I had bought an egg.
