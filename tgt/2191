2007-9-25 21: 48 Zhang Chunyan, a nurse from the critically ill area, stood by the patient for more than three hours as the Beijing News planed a special plan for the Beijing News, Wang Shuangxing Liang, Jing Yi Han Zuzu, a flying king, and proofreading Wu Xingfa.
病床上的年轻人29岁，早些时候，他曾告诉张春艳，老婆怀孕了，他快要做爸爸了。
The young man in the hospital bed was 29 years old. Earlier, he had told Zhang Chunyan that his wife was pregnant and that he was going to be a father.
但如今这位年轻的“准爸爸”病情正在恶化。
But now the young "prospective father" is getting worse.
张春艳站在一旁，看40袋50毫升的血浆随着导管，一点一点流入病人体内，医护人员们希望通过这种血液净化治疗，为他争取更多的时间。
Zhang stood aside and watched as 40 bags of 50ml of plasma trickled into the patient's body as doctors and nurses hoped to buy him more time with the blood purification therapy.
在金银潭医院，这样的治疗和抢救每天都在进行。
At the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital, such treatment and resuscitation are carried out daily.
作为武汉市突发公共卫生事件医疗救治定点医院和第一批定点收治新冠肺炎病人的医院，金银潭医院在一定程度上代表着国家新冠肺炎的治疗走向。
As a designated hospital for medical treatment of public health emergencies in Wuhan and the first hospitals to treat patients with Newly Coronary Pneumonia, Gold and Silver Pool Hospital represents the treatment trend of the new crown pneumonia in a certain extent.

━━━━━“封城”当日，年轻护士写好“遗书”1月23日，武汉“封城”的那天，林真真给自己写好了“遗书”。
Streams in the Desert (Jan. 23) On January 23, the day Wuhan was closed, Lin Zhengzhen wrote himself a suicide note.
她今年26岁，毕业后就来到金银潭医院从事护士工作，如今已经是第四个年头。
She is 26 years old and is now in her fourth year as a nurse at Gold and Silver Pool Hospital.
这天，和林真真同科室的一位护士感染了新冠肺炎，同一天，医院的一位重症监护室主任和一位医生也被病毒袭击。
On the same day, a nurse from the same department as Lin Zhengzhen contracted pneumonia. On the same day, a hospital intensive care unit director and a doctor were also attacked by the virus.
林真真发觉同事们的情绪显得低落。
Lin really found his colleagues in low spirits.
科室里，有人写了遗书。
In the department, someone wrote a suicide note.
她也写了，把银行卡密码和房子的购买合同放在一起，给了姐姐。
She also wrote, the bank card password and the purchase of the house together, to my sister.
“没敢直接告诉爸妈，怕他们受不住。
"I didn't dare to tell Mom and Dad, because they couldn't stand it.
”金银潭医院官网显示，全院拥有卫生专业技术人员685人。
The official website of the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital showed 685 medical professionals and technicians.
作为武汉市专门处理公共卫生事件的传染病医院，疫情暴发后，金银潭医院是最先收治新冠肺炎病人的定点医院，后期，其他医院开放、方舱医院建成后，依然有危重症患者陆续转到金银潭医院。
After the outbreak of the outbreak, Gold and Silver Pool Hospital was the first designated hospital to treat patients with Newcomial Pneumonia. After the opening of other hospitals and the completion of the Fang Cathedral Hospital, critical cases continued to be referred to the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital.
以前，林真真所在的科室工作量大，经常忙到“想家想妈妈还想哭”，但对比起如今的工作，突然觉得“以前的累不值一提”。
In the past, Lin Zhengzhen in the department workload, often busy to "homesick mother also want to cry", but compared to today's work, suddenly feel "tired before not worth mentioning.
金银潭医院的多位医护人员回忆，1月下旬，火神山、雷神山医院还未建成，国内医疗队还未大量到达，医院处在大量接收病人特别是确诊重症病人的阶段，也是最混乱无序的一段时间。
In the second half of January, before the construction of the Mount Huoshen and Lei Shenshan hospitals had been completed and domestic medical teams had not arrived in large numbers, the hospital was at the stage of receiving a large number of patients, especially those diagnosed with severe illnesses, and it was also the most chaotic period.
“一开始所有的肺炎病人收在一起，没有按照隔离要求，就是一个病房都收满，轻重症的都收在一起，没有分开。
"At first all the pneumonia patients were gathered together, not as the quarantine required, but one ward was full and the light and severe cases were gathered together and not separated.
”同一时间，开始有病人的情况发生恶化。
At the same time, the patient's condition began to deteriorate.
“（吸氧量）四五升都不行了，有的要四十、五十升，甚至上呼吸机。
Four or five liters, some forty, fifty, and even the ventilator.
有的在病房里没办法（呼吸），后来转到ICU插管。
Some were unable to breathe in the ward and then switched to ICU intubation.
”一位在金银潭医院工作多年的护士回忆，自收治新冠肺炎患者以来，她观察到这些病人吸的氧气都是4升5升以上的，这属于非常高的吸氧量。
A nurse who worked at the Golden Pool Hospital for years recalls seeing patients suffering from pneumonia breathing more than four litres of oxygen and more than five litres of oxygen, a very high oxygen uptake.
作为一线医护人员，此前从未遇到过这种情况。
As front-line medical personnel, this has never happened before.
随着疫情扩散，入院患者越来越多，金银潭部分病房临时改成重症监护室。
As the epidemic spread, more and more patients were admitted to hospital, gold and silver pool part of the ward into temporary intensive care unit.
1月17日起，同济医院团队留守金银潭医院南楼7层重症医学科；武汉人民医院和协和医院分别负责改造6层、5层为ICU。
On January 17, the Tongji Hospital team left behind the seven-storey intensive care unit in the south wing of the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital. Wuhan People's Hospital and Concorde Hospital are responsible for the rehabilitation of 6 and 5 floors respectively.
人民医院重症医学科副主任余追曾对媒体介绍，从1月19日开始，6层病区一边收治危重病患、一边完成改造，“ICU病房对设备要求是很专业的，改建初期很多配套跟不上，没有监护仪、呼吸机、输液泵等，加上团队临时拼凑，一开始很多工作难度非常大。
"Since January 19, the six-storey area has been undergoing intensive care and rehabilitation," said Yu Zhuan, deputy director of the department of intensive care at the People's Hospital. "The ICU ward is very professional in terms of equipment.
”▲2月13日，武汉金银潭医院，医务人员在ICU内查看患者身体状况。
On February 13, Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital, medical staff inside the ICU to check the patient's physical condition.
长江日报 陈卓摄湖南中南大学湘雅医院重症监护室护士张春艳从1月27日起支援武汉，回忆起早期的无序，她说：“很多护士没有在重症监护室上过班，呼吸机不会用，也不会血液净化治疗，像赶鸭子上架。
Zhang Chunyan, a nurse in Xiangya Hospital, Hunan Central South University, Changjiang Daily, who has been supporting Wuhan since January 27, recalls the early disorder. "A lot of nurses didn't work in intensive care units, the ventilator was not working, and there was no blood purification treatment, like putting ducks on shelves," she said.
”张春艳回忆，最初，因为物资有限，有些护士没有面屏，只戴着护目镜和口罩照顾病人。
Initially, because of limited supplies, some nurses didn't face the screen and looked after patients with goggles and masks, Zhang recalled.
那段时间，缚在病人身上的约束带也是护士们自己做的，插管的时候，有的病人感到不舒服，挣扎的力气会很大，有一次约束带直接断裂，张春艳赶紧跑过去按住病人的手，直到医生重新完成插管。
In those days, the straps that had been tied to the patient's body were made by the nurses themselves. When the intubation was performed, some patients felt uncomfortable and struggled with great strength.
和其他医院相比，作为一所传染病专科医院，前期金银潭医院的防护物资储备相对充足，但同时，由于前期重症病人大多由金银潭医院集中收治，物资开始出现缺口。
Compared with other hospitals, as a specialized hospital for infectious diseases, the initial gold and silver pool hospital was relatively well stocked with protective materials, but at the same time, as most of the patients in the early stages were treated centrally by the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital, shortages began to emerge.
第一批上海援鄂医疗队领队郑军华向媒体透露，当时金银潭医院仅剩500套防护隔离衣，只够使用两天。
Zheng Junhua, the leader of the first medical team in Shanghai, told reporters that the gold and silver pool hospital had only 500 sets of protective clothing available for only two days.
魏明是金银潭医院的一名科室主任，1月26日接受央视采访时，她在镜头前说出了面临的物资匮乏难题。
Wei Ming, a director of the gold and silver pool hospital, told CCTV on January 26 that she was facing a shortage of materials in front of the camera.
“我们最担心的是防护物资不够，到后天我们就没有N95口罩了……”话说到一半，魏明红了眼眶，不好意思地摆摆手，将头扭向一边。
"What we worry about most is that we don't have enough protective materials and we won't have N95 masks the day after tomorrow..." Wei said, flushing his eyes and shaking his head away in embarrassment.
魏明所在的科室只有4位医生，从20日开始连轴转，接连6天没有正常休息。
Wei Ming's department has only four doctors, from the beginning of the 20th axis rotation, six days without a normal rest.
倘若等不来防护物资，科室运转只会更加艰难。
If you don't wait for the supplies, the section will only get harder.
━━━━━援鄂飞机上，轻轻说了声：“新年快乐”1月24日，除夕。
A Happy New Year! On the airplane, a soft voice said: Happy New Year, January 24, New Year's Eve.
农历新年到来的时候，林真真所在的科室收到快递，有饺子、蛋糕、鲜花。
When the Chinese New Year comes, Lin Zhengzhen in the office received express delivery, dumplings, cakes, flowers.
同事送过来叫林真真一起吃，她才意识到，过年了。
Colleagues sent over to ask Lin really to eat together, she just realized that the New Year.
以往，妈妈在家也会包饺子、做春卷，原本按计划，林真真打算在这个春节带男朋友回家见父母。
In the past, my mother would make dumplings at home, spring roll, originally planned, Lin really intends to take her boyfriend home this Spring Festival to meet his parents.
钟声响起，上海中医药大学附属龙华医院呼吸科护士长甄暐与同事正在前往武汉的飞机上。
Zhen Zhen, head nurse of the respiratory department of Longhua Hospital attached to Shanghai TCM University, was travelling to Wuhan with his colleagues.
作为上海医疗队第一批135名队员之一，从下午5点半接到通知到登上飞机，短短不过几小时，她没来得及吃一口年夜饭。
As one of the first 135 members of the Shanghai medical team, she didn't have a chance to have a Chinese New Year's dinner in a few hours from 5: 30 p.m. to boarding the plane.
机舱外夜色弥漫，零点时，她和身边一起援鄂的队员轻轻地说了一声：“新年快乐”。
Night outside the cabin diffuse, at 0, she and the side of the team to help Hubei softly said: "Happy New Year."
金银潭医院的那幢白色建筑南六楼，是U型的重症病区。
The white building on the sixth floor of the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital is a severe U-shaped area.
在这里，多是50到70岁的重症病人，除了常规护理，护士还要负责病人的生活护理，打针、上药、吸痰、喂饭、照顾大小便、血液净化。
Here, in addition to routine care, nurses are responsible for patient life care, injections, medication, sputum suction, feeding, defecation and blood purification.
张春艳和同事们工作在南楼的五层、六层、七层，是收治最危重病人的病区。
Zhang Chunyan and her colleagues work on the fifth, sixth and seventh floors of the south building, where they treat the most critically ill patients.
张春艳主要负责的工作是血液净化治疗，俗称“血透”，将重症病人的血液输出，依靠治疗设备清除其中的炎症因子，再将干净的血液回输到病人体内，减缓疾病的进展，为治疗争取更多时间，降低病死率。
Zhang Chunyan is mainly responsible for blood purification treatment, commonly known as "hemodialysis," the severe patient's blood output, rely on treatment equipment to remove inflammation factors, then return clean blood to the patient's body, slow the progress of the disease, buy more time for treatment, and reduce the fatality rate.
她第一次做了如此严实的防护：衣服4层，包括贴身衣服、工作服、隔离衣、防水衣；口罩两层，N95口罩外加普通外科口罩；外科手套3层。
For the first time, she made such a sturdy protective garment: four layers of clothing, coveralls, paraphernalia, waterproof clothing; two masks, N95 mask plus general surgical mask; surgical gloves, 3 floors.
第一天上班，张春艳负责了6个病人，是以前工作量的两倍，一工作就是11个小时，下班时还要打扫垃圾——因为医院缺乏清理工，张春艳和同事需要自己把垃圾袋捆起来。
On the first day at work, Zhang Chunyan took charge of six patients, twice as many as before, 11 hours a day at work and cleaning the garbage because the hospital lacked cleaning technology and Zhang and his colleagues had to tie up the bags themselves.
“头几天时，（累到）快崩溃了。
"The first few days it was almost a crash.
”▲2月13日，武汉金银潭医院，一位医生在进入负压病房前穿戴防护装备。
On February 13, Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital, a doctor wearing protective equipment before entering the negative pressure ward.
长江日报 陈卓摄有护士回忆，不仅因为生活护理增加了工作量，常规护理也会因为重重防护显得吃力。
Changjiang daily Chen Zhuoshe has nurses recall that not only because of the increased workload of life care, routine care will also be difficult due to heavy protection.
“比如简单的输液，手上戴着几层手套，眼睛上的护目镜在起水雾。
"A simple infusion, a couple of gloves on your hand, and goggles on your eyes fogging," he says.
（血管）摸也不容易摸到，看也看不清，而且穿上防护服很闷，有病人开玩笑说：你们护士比我们还喘呢。
It's not easy to touch, it's hard to see, and it's stuffy in protective gear and patients joke, You nurses are panting even more than we do.
”张春艳的一位同事曾对媒体讲述：（和搭档）之前不认识，你说话的那个点，对方也不一定知道。
One of Zhang's colleagues once told the press that he had not met before and that the point at which you were speaking was not necessarily known.
比如在抢救的时候，谁负责按压，谁负责喷药，谁来记录抢救时间，谁下医嘱，一个团队的人分工都应该很明确。
For example, in rescue, who is responsible for pressure, who is responsible for spraying, who records the rescue time, who orders, a team division of labor should be very clear.
但是现在大家都穿着防护服，谁也不认识谁，你刚过来，也不清楚抢救物资在哪里，又要喊人帮忙，但是别人也要管六七个病人，她们自己的病人可能状况也不是很好。
But now that everybody is wearing protective clothing and no one knows anyone, and you've just come here, you don't know where the emergency supplies are and you need help, but the other people have to take care of six or seven patients, and their own patients may not be in very good shape.
整个人在慌乱和盲目中做这些事情，压力真的很大。
The whole person in panic and blind to do these things, the pressure is really great.
庆幸的是，在工作第10天时，支援队伍越来越多，张春艳所在的小组就有了来自福建、安徽等地的医务人员，7个人的小组集齐了五湖四海，张春艳的工作稍微轻松了一点。
Fortunately, in the 10th day of work, more and more support teams, Zhang Chunyan's team from Fujian, Anhui, and other places, the group of seven people gathered around the world, Zhang Chunyan's work a little easier.
2月17日下午，国家卫健委医政医管局监察专员介绍，全国已经派出了3.2万余名的医务人员支持湖北武汉，他们主要来自于呼吸、感染、重症等专业。
On the afternoon of February 17, the Hospital Authority (HA) inspectors of the National Fitness and Physical Fitness Commission reported that more than 32,000 medical personnel had been sent to support Wuhan, Hubei Province, mainly from the areas of breathing, infection and serious diseases.
和医护人员一起增加的还有病床，据央视报道，1月26日，陆军军医大学医疗队进驻金银潭医院，紧急将医院的综合病房楼改造完成，新增96张床位。
On January 26, a medical team from the Army Medical University entered the gold and silver pool hospital to urgently complete the renovation of the hospital's complex, adding 96 beds, CCTV reported.

On the same day, doctor Wu Zhixiong and colleagues complete the house inspection.
“就是感觉比想象中的重，重病人比想象中的多，基本上绝大部分的ICU里面的病人全在用呼吸机支持。
"It's feeling heavier than you think, there's more serious cases than you think, and basically most of the patients in ICUs are supported by breathing machines.
”吴志雄介绍，主要的治疗思路就是根据诊疗方案做好支持治疗，让病人不要处于缺氧状态。
Wu Zhixiong said the main treatment is to provide supportive treatment according to the diagnosis and treatment plan so that patients do not suffer from hypoxia.

长江日报 陈卓摄另外，因为新冠肺炎是病毒性肺炎，医生们会为患者进行抗病毒药物治疗，如果有合并的细菌感染，则酌情增加抗细菌的抗生素。
Changjiang daily Chan Cheuk-sheng added that as pneumonia is viral pneumonia, doctors will treat patients with antiviral drugs, if there is a co-infection with bacteria, where appropriate, anti-bacterial antibiotics.
平日里，病人可以把手机带进ICU。
On weekdays, patients can bring their mobile phones into the ICU.
吴志雄印象深刻的是一位65岁的老太。
Wu was impressed by a 65-year-old woman.
只要一有精神就会和女儿打电话，但病情始终在慢慢加重，尽管医生用了很多治疗方法，到最后，她已经没有了拿手机的力气。
She would call her daughter whenever she had the energy, but the condition continued to get worse and, despite the many treatments, she did not have the strength to hold the phone.
即使这样，“手机一直放在手边上。
Even so, "the phone is always on hand.
”吴志雄说，“她之前还和我说，想要赶紧好起来，回去照顾外孙女，说女儿上班很辛苦，担心家里的小孩没法照顾。
"She told me before that she wanted to get better quickly, to go back and take care of her granddaughter, who was working very hard and worried that her children would not be able to take care of her.
”吴志雄说，和对方聊天，也有种和自家长辈聊天的感觉。
Wu Zhixiong said chatting with the other person also had a feeling of chatting with his elders.
于是一直安慰她，没关系，肯定会出院，可以早点回去，看到外孙女，和女儿一起团聚。
So always comforted her, all right, will definitely leave hospital, can go back early, see granddaughter, and daughter together.
但病情一直在加快，吴志雄接手三周后，老人去世了。
But the illness has been accelerating, Wu Zhixiong took over three weeks, the old man died.
“整个恶化的过程特别难受。
"The whole process of deterioration is particularly painful.
”相处时间久了，吴志雄越来越感慨，每个病人背后都是一个家庭，一个病人平平安安出院，可能会改变一家人的命运；反之，也会改变一家人的命运。
Over time, Wu increasingly lamented that behind each patient was a family, and that a patient's safe discharge could change the fate of a family, and vice versa.
在“前线”，无力感和希望在医护人员的心中交替。
On the "front line," feelings of powerlessness and hope alternate in the minds of medical staff.

Before the illness, the Jiangxia First People's Hospital / Concorde Jiangnan Hospital Respiratory and Critical Medical Doctor has been in the frontline of epidemic prevention and treatment.
张春艳原本以为，2月19日的血浆置换，也在为彭银华一点一点注入康复的希望，“我们都希望他快点好”。
Zhang Chunyan originally thought that February 19 plasma replacement, but also for Peng Yinhua bit by bit into the hope of recovery, "we all hope he quickly better."
可20日晚上9点50分，还是传来了他去世的消息。
But at 9: 50 p.m. on the 20th, word came of his death.

Zhang Chunyan said he took care of an infected male nurse, fat, in his fifties, unable to breathe. "Every time I see him, I feel very sick breathing, sometimes standing next to him, can only hold his hand and comfort him.

当医护们在病房里日夜忙碌时，金银潭急救站的工作人员也一直在路上。
The staff of the gold and silver pool emergency station were on the way as the doctors and nurses were busy working day and night in the ward.
2019年12月29日，金银潭急救站接到指令，“转运一些不明原因肺炎的病人”到金银潭医院；31日起，开始有了多位同类病人的转运；后来，新冠肺炎患者的数字在2020年1月开始增长。
On 29 December 2019, the Gold and Silver Pool Emergency Station was instructed to "transfer patients suffering from unexplained pneumonia" to the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital. Starting from 31 December 2019, there were a number of transshipments of patients of the same kind. Later, the number of new cases of pneumonia began to increase in January 2020.
武汉市急救中心在全市共设有57个急救站，疫情暴发后，其他站负责将求助者送往医院急诊科，而金银潭急救站主要负责转运确诊病例。
The Wuhan Emergency Centre operates 57 first aid stations throughout the city. After the outbreak, other stations are responsible for sending the patients to the emergency department of the hospital. Gold and Silver Pool Emergency Station is mainly responsible for the transfer of confirmed cases.
设备也和多数急救站有所不同，金银潭的两台救护车是负压车，可以最大限度地减少医务人员交叉感染的几率，并将车内的空气进行无害化处理后排出。
The equipment is also different from most emergency stations, and the two ambulances in the gold and silver pool are negative pressure vehicles that minimize the risk of cross-infection by medical staff and discharge the air in the vehicle in a harmless manner.
封城后，病人增加，站里的两辆救护车开始同时上岗。
After the closure of the city, the number of patients increased, the station two ambulances began to work simultaneously.
“相当于工作48小时才能有一天的休息时间，但是如果休息的那一天有其他的任务，比如搬运物资等等，大家也是要去完成的。
"It's the equivalent of working 48 hours to have a day off, but if there are other tasks on the day of rest, such as moving supplies, everyone has to do it.
” 急救站工作人员李飞说。
"said Li Fei, an emergency station worker.
需要转运的确诊病例多的时候，每辆负压车要容纳5至8位病人，李飞介绍，这很考验医务人员的处置能力。
When the number of confirmed cases requiring transshipment is high, each negative pressure vehicle should hold five to eight patients, Li said.
