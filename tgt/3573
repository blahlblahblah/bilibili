武汉封城后，各地医疗队和救援防护物资仍需要源源不断输入武汉，保证生命线的畅通。
Wuhan after the closure of the city, medical teams and rescue and protection materials still need to be continuously imported into Wuhan, to ensure the lifeline unimpeded.
特殊时期，一些特殊航班成了通往疫情“风暴眼”仅有的几个渠道之一，扮演了特殊角色2月5日,中航集团包机从日本大阪接223名湖北籍旅客回国。
Special flights became one of the few routes to the eye of the storm, playing a special role. On February 5, Air China Group chartered a flight from Osaka, Japan, to pick up 223 Hubei passengers.
图/受访者提供通往疫情“风暴眼”的特殊航班本刊记者/杨智杰发于2020.3.16总第939期《中国新闻周刊》机长顾振宇接到飞行任务电话通知时，距离飞机起飞不足6小时。
Photo / interviewee provides a special flight to the eye of the storm Our correspondent / Yang Zhijie was dispatched to China News Weekly captain Gu Zhenyu in 2020.3.16, No. 939, less than 6 hours before the plane took off.
这在他27年的驾驶经历中，极为罕见。
This was rare in his 27 years of driving.
他1993年成为飞行学员，1999年底从中国国际航空公司（以下简称国航）副驾驶员升为机长。
He became a pilot cadet in 1993 and was promoted from co-pilot to pilot-in-command at the end of 1999.
通常情况下，飞行任务会提前72小时下达，这还仅限于熟悉的机场和熟悉的航线。
Frequently, missions are issued 72 hours in advance, which is limited to familiar airports and familiar routes.
挂掉电话，此时是大年初三下午两点多，顾振宇立刻开车赶往机场。
Hanging up the phone, this is New Year's Day more than 2: 00 p.m., Gu Zhenyu immediately drove to the airport.
下午4点，三名机组人员到达集结地点，换好制服、拿到装备、测量体温，顾振宇仍然没有拿到飞行计划，这意味着：“要飞哪架飞机？具体货物重量？体积是多少？都是未知数。
At 4 p.m., the three crew members arrived at the assembly point, changed their uniforms, got their equipment and took their temperature, and Gu still did not have a flight plan, meaning: "Which plane is going to fly? What is the weight of the cargo? What is the volume? It is unknown.
”唯一清楚的是，三个多小时后，作为机长，顾振宇很可能要驾驶空客A330飞机，运送一支150人的北京医疗队，前往新冠肺炎疫情最严重的武汉。
The only thing clear is that, more than three hours later, as captain, Gu is likely to fly an Airbus A330 to transport a 150-strong Beijing medical team to Wuhan, the worst hit by the outbreak.
“很有可能”，是因为还有另外一架飞机和一套机组、乘务人员，在和顾振宇做同样的准备。
"Most likely", there is another plane and a set of crew, crew, and Gu Zhenyu in the same preparation.
这看上去颠覆了民用航空的规律——民航飞行严格按照计划推进，航空公司会提前制定好一段时间的航班计划，组织人员按部就班执行。
This seems to have upended the rules of civil aviation, where flights are proceeding as planned, with airlines planning their flights well in advance and organizing people to follow them.
即便遇到雨雪天气或大面积流量控制，航班延误，航空公司的应对方式也有一套特定的流程。
Even in the face of rain and snow weather or large-area traffic control, flight delays, airlines have a specific set of procedures to deal with.
但春节前突然暴发的新冠疫情，让民航的许多工作变得不可预知。
But the sudden outbreak of a new crown ahead of the Spring Festival has left much of civil aviation unpredictable.
1月23日，为阻断疫情传播，武汉封城，机场、火车站等离汉通道关闭。
January 23, in order to stop the spread of the epidemic, Wuhan closed the city, airports, railway stations and other Han passage closed.
随后，多个国家暂停了往返中国的航班。
Subsequently, several countries suspended flights to and from China.
一个多月内，仅仅是国航，涉及武汉的3000多个班次被取消。
In more than a month, Air China alone cancelled more than 3,000 flights involving Wuhan.
但同时，各地医疗队和救援防护物资仍需要源源不断输入武汉，保证生命线的畅通。
But at the same time, all over the medical teams and rescue materials still need to be continuously imported into Wuhan to ensure the lifeline unimpeded.
特殊时期，这些特殊航班成了通往疫情“风暴眼”仅有的几个渠道之一，扮演了特殊角色。
These special flights played a special role as one of the few routes to the eye of the storm.
6小时紧急“备飞”“第三批医疗队今天要出发，大概人数是150人，物资不详。
The third medical team is leaving today. It will number about 150, and the supplies are not known.
”国航运行控制中心党委书记韩景岩对《中国新闻周刊》回忆，从除夕开始，国家卫健委和中国民航局向国内多家航空公司发出指令，执行紧急医疗支援包机。
Han Jingyan, party secretary of the Air China Control Center, told China News Weekly that since New Year's Eve, the state health committee and China's civil aviation authority have issued instructions to domestic airlines to carry out emergency medical support charter flights.
大年初三上午10点35分，国航CA041航班刚刚运送北京第二批医疗队到达武汉后，没过多久，国航运控中心又接到新任务。
At 10: 35 a.m. on Wednesday, Air China Flight CA041 had just delivered the second batch of medical teams from Beijing to Wuhan, and a short time later, the National Shipping Control Center was given a new assignment.
运行控制中心是组织飞机运行的中枢部门。
The Operations Control Center is the central department for organizing the operation of aircraft.
考虑到医疗物资的不确定性，运控中心在两小时内调配一架空客A330客机和一架波音737客机，同时待命，避免临时更换飞机。
Given the uncertainty surrounding medical supplies, the Operations Control Centre deployed one Airbus A330 and one Boeing 737 within two hours, while remaining on standby to avoid the temporary replacement of aircraft.
顾振宇从2006年起，开始驾驶空客A330机型，这种宽体客机，运送乘客和货物的能力远远超过窄体机，主要飞洲际航线和国内北上广之间的干线，很少执行国内飞武汉的航班。
Since 2006, Gu has operated the Airbus A330, a wide-bodied passenger and cargo aircraft capable of carrying passengers and cargo that far outstrips narrow-bodied aircraft, flying mainly between intercontinental routes and the country's northward and northbound trunk lines, and rarely carries out domestic flights to Wuhan.
“我们对武汉疫情在持续关注，各地医疗队去武汉支援，从人数和医疗设备估算，迟早会用上宽体机。
"We are constantly concerned about the situation in Wuhan, medical teams from all over the support to Wuhan, from the number of people and medical equipment estimates, sooner or later will be used.
”顾振宇对《中国新闻周刊》说。
"Gu told China News Weekly.
他没有告诉家人自己要飞武汉，以免他们担心，只是简单解释了一句，“正常加班”。
He did not tell his family to fly to Wuhan, lest they worry, but simply explained that "normal overtime."
1月27日下午4点，4辆卡车装载着口罩、防护服等医疗物资，到达首都国际机场。
At 4 p.m. on 27 January, four trucks carrying medical supplies, including masks and protective clothing, arrived at the Capital International Airport.
物资的体积超出波音737的货舱容积，正如顾振宇所料，空客A330上阵。
The size of the cargo exceeds that of Boeing 737 and, as Gu predicted, Airbus A330 was on the scene.
下午5点，机长顾振宇和其他两位机组人员登上飞机，对飞机进行例行检查。
At 5 p.m., the captain, Gu Zhenyu, and two other crew members boarded the plane for a routine inspection.
直到此时，他们还没拿到确切的登机人数和物资重量——这是顾振宇最迫切想要知道的数据。
Until then, they had not been given the exact number of people and the weight of the materials that Gu needed to know most.
“从防疫角度看，我们应该在武汉停留的时间越短越好，接触的人员越少越好。
"From the perspective of epidemic prevention, we should stay in Wuhan for as short a time as possible, the less contact the better.
” 顾振宇说，这对机组的要求是，飞机需要准备足够的油量，支撑飞机回程。
Mr. Gu said the pair needed to be prepared with enough fuel to support the plane's return journey.
航班往返所需油量可以推算出来，但前提是，要知道飞机上人和货物的重量，“加油过多，飞机到武汉机场可能会超重落地，影响安全，这种任务绝对不能出安全问题。
The amount of fuel required for a flight to and from Wuhan can be extrapolated, but only if the weight of the people and cargo on the plane is known. "Too much refuelling could cause the plane to land at Wuhan airport, affecting safety.
如果油带少了，就必须在武汉加油，要跟人接触，就会有现场防疫的问题。
If the oil belt is less, must refuel in Wuhan, to contact with people, there will be on-the-spot epidemic prevention.
”运控中心作为“大脑”，需要考虑的问题更多。
As the "brain," the Operations Control Center has more to think about.
“飞机飞到武汉，如果临时出现故障怎么办？如果武汉天气不好，需要备降怎么办？我们都要制定相应的预案，而且不能和正常的航班一样。
"If the plane flies to Wuhan, what if there is a temporary breakdown? If Wuhan weather is bad, what should we do? We have to make corresponding plans, and can not be the same as normal flights.
” 运行控制中心总值班室高级经理孔建荣告诉《中国新闻周刊》，他们还要准备其他预案，例如，武汉如果突降暴雨或下雪，飞机不能备降在湖北境内的机场，那就必须返回北京，才能保障及时地支援。
Kong Jianrong, senior manager of the Operations Control Center's chief duty office, told China News Weekly that they would have to prepare other plans, such as returning to Beijing to ensure timely support if the plane doesn't land at an airport in Hubei province due to heavy rain or snow.
防疫物资的运输也不同于以往。
The transport of epidemic prevention materials is also different.
航空运输对货物的重量和体积都有相关要求，但此次运送的防疫物资多是防护服和口罩，重量轻但体积大，货舱根本装不下，只能将一部分物资放在了客舱。
Air transport is required for weight and volume of cargo, but most of the epidemic prevention materials shipped are protective clothing and masks, light weight but large, cargo holds simply do not fit, can only put part of the goods in the cabin.
韩景岩说，经民航局批准，特殊航班可以特殊操作，他们将物资捆绑，用系安全带等办法固定在座位上。
'Subject to the approval of the Civil Aviation Administration, special flights can be operated in a special way, 'he said.
晚上8点多，距离起飞还有半小时，顾振宇终于拿到了飞机的业载数据，包括乘客、物资重量，据此调整好飞机的油量。
With more than 8 p. m., and half an hour before takeoff, Gu finally got the aircraft's load data, including passengers and weight, and adjusted the aircraft's fuel load accordingly.
晚上8时47分，国航飞行总队一大队机组顾振宇、文军、袁斌执行的CA043航班，搭载着150名医疗人员和超过13吨的医用物资，从北京首都国际机场起飞前往武汉。
At 8: 47 p.m., CA043, operated by a brigade of Air China's main flight crew, Gu Zhenyu, Wenjun and Yuan Bin, carried 150 medical personnel and more than 13 tons of medical supplies from Beijing's Capital International Airport for Wuhan.
1月27日，国航第八架救灾包机飞赴武汉。
On January 27, Air China's eighth charter flight to Wuhan.
图/受访者提供起飞前的机长广播，顾振宇有感而发：“在特殊时期，能够运送医护人员和医疗物资前往武汉疫区，我感到非常荣幸，向你们致以崇高的敬意。
Photo / Respondent provided a broadcast by the pilot before taking off. Gu felt very honored and honored to be able to transport medical personnel and medical supplies to the affected areas of Wuhan during special periods.
”不久之后，几万英尺高空响起另一种声音，让顾振宇感到温暖。
"Not long after, another sound, tens of thousands of feet high, warmed Gu.
塔台管制员从航班编号的“密码”中发现了这趟特殊航班，在发送了指令后，不同寻常地对CA043说了声，“辛苦了”。
The tower controller found the special flight in the "password" of the flight number and, after issuing the order, said to the CA043 in an unusual way, "Hard."
在同一个区域内，正在飞行的其他飞机也向这趟特殊航班发来问候，“辛苦了，武汉加油！”两天抢出来的国际航线2月3日下午，国航运控中心收到一个明确通知：两天后，国航需要派飞机前往日本大阪，将滞留当地的223名湖北籍旅客，以及日本社会各界和华人华侨捐赠的近2.5吨的防疫物资，一同运回武汉。
In the same region, other aircraft in flight also sent greetings to the special flight, "Hard work, Wuhan refueling!" On the afternoon of February 3, Air China received a clear notification: two days later, Air China needed to send an aircraft to Osaka, Japan, to return 223 stranded Hubei tourists, as well as nearly 2.5 tons of epidemic prevention materials donated by Japanese communities and overseas Chinese.
接到通知时，国航大阪营业部已经下班，留给航空公司准备的时间只有一天。
At the time of the notification, the Osaka branch of Air China was off duty, leaving the airline with only one day to prepare.
负责统一调配的运控中心，必须连夜制订好飞行计划。
The operation control center, which is responsible for the unified deployment, must make flight plans overnight.
韩景岩说，运控中心首先确定了机型，“由A330-300客机执行，国航在大阪没有运力，需要从总部调配一架飞机，从北京飞到大阪，再飞往武汉。
Hanjingyan said the center first identified a model, "executed by the A330-300, which has no capacity in Osaka, and would have to deploy an aircraft from its headquarters, fly from Beijing to Osaka and then fly to Wuhan.
”但运控中心碰到的第一个问题是，飞机上必须配备的2名卫健委派去的医护人员，是否有日本签证？1天后就要起飞了，临时办签证来不及，运控中心最终决定，从北京到大阪采用包机方式，医护人员不下飞机，就不涉及签证问题。
However, the first problem encountered by the operation control center was whether the two health-care personnel appointed by the two health workers on board the aircraft had Japanese visas? One day later, it would be too late to arrange visas temporarily.
新增一个国际航班，并不简单。
Adding a new international flight is not easy.
运控中心要尽快确定空中航线，飞哪条路更合适，涉及飞越的国家，航空公司需要专门去申请。
Transportation control center to determine the air route as soon as possible, which route is more appropriate, involving overflight countries, airlines need to apply specifically.
北京飞往大阪会路过韩国，他们要提前算好在韩国出入境的时间和地点、走哪条航路，提前一天跟韩国民航部门进行申请。
Beijing will fly to Osaka will pass Korea, they have to calculate in advance the time and place of entry and exit in Korea, which route to take, one day in advance with the Korean Civil Aviation Department to apply.
这些工作，都得在4日一天之内完成。
All this work must be finished within four days.
而按正常程序，新增一个国际航班，航空公司需要至少提前一个半月，在特定的时期申请。
Under the normal procedure, with the addition of an international flight, airlines need to apply at least a month and a half in advance, at a specific time.
2月4日当地时间上午9点，国航大阪营业部总经理白戈拿到了飞行计划。
February 4, 9: 00 a.m. local time, Air Osaka business general manager Bai Ge got the flight plan.
一天之内，他们要向大阪关西机场申请航班落地时刻的飞行许可，与机场各部门协调机场保障，组织滞留旅客购票。
Within a day, they will apply to Osaka Kansai Airport for flight clearance at the time of arrival, coordinate airport security with airport authorities, and organize ticket purchases for stranded passengers.
此外，他们还需向日本国土交通省申请飞行许可，“几个部门同时在做，大家跟打仗一样。
In addition, they have to apply to Japan's Ministry of Land, Transport and Communications for permission to fly.
”当天下午，距离韩国民航部门下班只剩1小时，北京的运控中心还未拿到批复。
That afternoon, with only an hour to go before the South Korean civil aviation authorities finished work, Beijing's operational control centre had not yet received a reply.
韩景岩又通过当地营业部和韩国紧急联系，在下班前半小时终于顺利获得批复，“一块石头落了地”。
Hanjingyan through the local business department and emergency contact with South Korea, half an hour before the work was finally approved, "a stone fell to the ground."
2月5日11点，白戈来到大阪关西国际机场，发现这里已经严阵以待。
February 5, 11 o'clock, Baige came to Osaka Kansai International Airport, found here ready.
机场为了将这批人与其他旅客完全分开，将航班放在T2航站楼的一个公务机候机厅，单独候机。
The airport, in order to completely separate the group from other passengers, placed the flights in a business terminal in the T2 terminal and waited alone.
这群游客来自湖北，假如一旦在候机和飞行中发生传染，将是另一场灾难，因此需要对他们进行严格排查。
This group of tourists from Hubei, if in the airport and in the event of infection, will be another disaster, they need to be strictly checked.
每名旅客都需要测量体温，需要声明离开湖北是否超过14天，以14天为界限，分开安置。
Each passenger needs to have his temperature taken, and a statement is required as to whether he will leave Hubei for more than 14 days, with a 14-day limit.
为避免飞机上交叉感染的风险，所有乘客要在登机前就餐。
To avoid the risk of cross-infection, all passengers should eat before boarding.
尤腾是国航北京客舱高级经理，参与此次航班的保障任务。
Yu Teng is the senior manager of Air China's Beijing cabin, participating in the flight guarantee mission.
到达大阪前，机组人员、安全员和8名乘务员都要求换上防护服。
Before arriving in Osaka, the crew, the warden and the eight flight attendants all asked to change into protective clothing.
尤腾最初还有些担心，这样会不会给旅客带来恐慌，但没想到，旅客的自我防范意识更强。
Yu Teng also worried at first, this will not bring panic to the passengers, but did not expect, passengers are more self-defense awareness.
尤腾接待登机的第一批旅客是一家四口，都穿着防护服，裹得严严实实，他一愣，一时间没分清是工作人员还是旅客。
The first group of passengers to board the plane was a family of four, all in protective clothing, wrapped up in a trance, he did not distinguish between staff members and passengers.
他对当时的情形印象深刻：“旅客分为两个派系，一派非常专业，穿着防护服；另一派系是民间派，穿着雨衣，戴着泳镜，脚底套个塑料袋。
He was impressed by the situation: "The passengers were divided into two factions, one very professional and wearing protective clothing, and the other a civilian, wearing a raincoat, goggles and a plastic bag over the soles of his feet.
所以，反倒是如果我们不穿，旅客可能会质疑我们。
So, instead, if we don't wear them, the passengers might question us.
”紧绷的“指挥中枢”截至3月9日，中航集团执行救援运输包机累计47班，利用包机运送医疗人员4546人，接回海外同胞430人，运输防疫物资近404吨；并利用正常航班和货机1634班，运送防疫物资2457吨。
By March 9, CAAC had conducted a total of 47 rescue and transportation flights, using charter flights to transport 4,546 medical personnel, 430 compatriots overseas and 404 tons of epidemic prevention materials, and transported 2,457 tons of epidemic prevention materials on normal flights and cargo flights.
武汉封城之后，未来三天该怎么办？未来航班量一定会骤降，哪些航班会受到影响？运控中心都需要制定后续的处理办法。
Wuhan after the closure of the city, how to do in the next three days? Flights will fall sharply in the future, which flights will be affected? Control Center needs to develop follow-up treatment.
孔建荣曾经历过2003年的SARS疫情，但现在很多机制和程序与当年完全不同，航班量也不在一个级别。
Mr. Kong experienced the SARS epidemic in 2003, but many mechanisms and procedures are now quite different from those of the year, and the number of flights is not at the same level.
他记得，2003年，国航一天只有400个左右的班次，如今这个数字是1400班。
He recalls that Air China had only about 400 flights a day in 2003, compared with 1,400 today.
韩景岩表示，这次疫情对航空产业确实带来比较大的冲击，“去年春运国航大概有53000班次，今年春运，我们只有35000班次，锐减了40%。
"Last spring there were about 53,000 flights by Air China, but this spring we had only 35,000 flights, a sharp drop of 40 percent," he said.
”此外，根据国航提供的数据，从武汉封城到3月6日，国航在湖北区域内取消了4010班次，武汉取消了3664班次。
In addition, Air China cancelled 4,010 flights in Hubei province and 3,664 flights in Wuhan between Wuhan Fengcheng and March 6, according to Air China.
航班量取消，但运控中心的工作量却在增加。
The volume of flights is cancelled, but the workload of the Operations Control Centre is increasing.
作为航空公司内部协调、指挥的部门，运控中心不仅需要掌握疫情的进展，协调的部门也远远超出过去的范畴。
As the coordination and command department within the airline, the operation and control center not only needs to know the progress of the epidemic, but also coordinates the departments far beyond the scope of the past.
“原来我们可能只跟民航局、空管局、机场去沟通，但是现在要跟海关检疫、卫健委，甚至国外的政府部门沟通。
"We may only communicate with the Civil Aviation Administration, the Air Traffic Control Administration and the airport, but now we have to communicate with the Customs Quarantine and Health Commission and even with government departments abroad.
原来都不涉及这些渠道，没有相应的流程，现在就是摸索着去做，然后建立相应的制度。
Originally did not involve these channels, no corresponding process, is now groping to do, and then establish the corresponding system.
”孔建荣说。
"said Kong Jianyong.
2月1日，越南航空管理局宣布，从13点起关闭越南与中国之间的所有航线。
On 1 February, the Viet Nam Aviation Administration announced that all routes between Viet Nam and China would be closed from 1300 hours.
消息来得突然，让很多航空公司措手不及。
The news came as a surprise to many airlines.
当天下午16点，国航的一班飞机原本即将从越南飞回国内，旅客甚至都已经抵达机场。
At 16: 00 p.m., an Air China flight was due to return from Vietnam, and passengers had even arrived at the airport.
在当天晚上20点，国航还有另一个航班将要回程。
Air China also had another flight to return at 20: 00 pm that day.
收到通知后，按规定，航空公司只能按照对方的规则停飞，这意味着，国航的许多乘客将滞留在当地。
Upon receipt of the notification, the airline was required to suspend flights in accordance with each other's rules, which meant that many Air China passengers would stay there.
“东南亚很多国家可以落地签，游客通常只去玩几天就回来了。
"Many countries in Southeast Asia can land visas and tourists usually come back after only a few days of playing.
这时候断航，他们又没有签证，还能去哪？”孔建荣坦言，航空公司也很着急，“这是咱们的同胞，他们在那里人生地不熟”。
At this time, they do not have visas, where else can go? "Kong Jianrong confessed, the airline is anxious," this is our compatriots, they are not familiar with life there. "
国航营业部随即和越南民航局进行协商，最后寻找到变相的妥协方式，派空机将旅客接回，尽量减小断航的风险。
Air China's business department and Vietnam's Civil Aviation Authority immediately negotiated, finally found a disguised compromise, to send empty planes back to passengers to minimize the risk of interruption.
“这种突发情况比较多，运营人员也要时刻统计哪些国家对航班做出限制。
"There are more such incidents and operators need to keep track of which countries place restrictions on flights.
”孔建荣介绍，在疫情期间，整个国航运控中心时刻处在紧绷状态。
Kong Jianrong said the entire nation's shipping and control center was under strain during the outbreak.
有时候，刚下班，临时有事情需要协调，又要立刻回到岗位。
Sometimes, just after work, temporary things need to be coordinated, and immediately back to work.
“如果仅靠自己，我们即使累死也协调不过来，这是整体体系的保障。
"If we rely on ourselves, we will not be able to coordinate even if tired, this is the safeguard of the whole system.
”孔建荣感慨，“这不是国航一家，而是各地区管理局、空管局以及整个民航局，一起促成的。
"This is not Air China," Mr Kong laments. "It is a combination of regional authorities, ATMB and the entire Civil Aviation Authority.
”根据中国民航局数据，疫情期间，截至3月6日，共组织29家国内航空公司执行413架次任务，运输人员3.67万名、物资2630.7吨。
According to China's Civil Aviation Administration, as of March 6, a total of 29 domestic airlines had carried out 413 missions, transporting 36,700 people and 2630.7 tons of supplies.
其中，共运输医疗队302架次，医护和其他救援人员共3.38万名；接回滞留海外旅客任务13架次，接回旅客1647名；执行运输物资任务87架次，包含海外航班39架次。
Among them, 302 sorties were flown by medical teams, 33,800 medical and other relief workers, 13 were flown to collect 1,647 passengers from overseas, and 87 were flown to transport goods, including 39 overseas flights.
这些航班，成为疫情期间特殊的“生命线”。
These flights became a special "lifeline" during the outbreak.
