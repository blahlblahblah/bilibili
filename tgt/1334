基于疫情冲击的现实情况，可以优先落实医疗用品等相关协议内容的执行，并在保证中方正常权益的情况下，推动双方在延伸领域的技术合作和人员交流，将疫情转化为双边的合作契机徐奇渊 | 文当前，疫情已经对中国宏观经济运行产生了影响，春节期间部分服务行业受到较大冲击。
Given the reality of the epidemic, priority can be given to implementing the contents of medical supplies and other related agreements.While ensuring China's normal rights and interests, China will promote technical cooperation and personnel exchanges in this area, and turn the epidemic into a bilateral cooperation opportunity.
在此背景下，1月15日中美签署的第一阶段协议当中的2000亿美元采购承诺可能受到影响。
In that context, the $200 billion procurement commitments in the first phase of the January 15 agreement between China and the United States could be affected.
如果可能，中国应以合适的方式，提出推迟实施这一采购计划。
If possible, China shall propose in an appropriate manner the postponement of the implementation of this procurement plan.
四方面原因将迫使中国推迟采购中国经济增速下滑，进口需求受到冲击。
Four reasons will force China to delay procurement China's economic growth rate decline, import demand hit.
中国国内航空受到较大冲击，客流量和航班大幅减少。
Domestic airlines have been hit hard, with passenger traffic and flights falling sharply.
航空公司经营状况将受到较大冲击，资金链也将受到影响。
Airlines will be affected by the operation of the larger impact, the financial chain will also be affected.
目前疫情发展仍存在一定的不确定性，短期内难以实施大规模的飞机采购方案。
At present, there is still some uncertainty in the development of the epidemic, it is difficult to implement a large-scale aircraft procurement programme.
此外，国内工业生产尚未完全恢复正常秩序，整体生产进度较往年明显滞后。
In addition, domestic industrial production has not fully returned to normal order, overall production has lagged behind previous years.
在比较乐观的情况下，即便是全国在3月初基本实现复产，生产也将推迟一个月，而且疫区复产还需要更长时间。
In a more optimistic scenario, even if the country were to resume production by early March, production would be delayed by a month and it would take longer for the affected areas to resume production.
因此，一阶段协议中，中国对美国的工业机械、电气设备、能源等进口需求，也将需要明显推后。
As a result, China's import demand for US industrial machinery, electrical equipment and energy will also need to be significantly delayed in the first phase of the agreement.
一季度中国的国际收支压力将明显增大，扩大采购将进一步加大国际收支失衡的压力。
The first quarter of China's balance of payments pressure will be significantly increased, expanding procurement will further increase the balance of payments imbalance pressure.
疫情冲击下，进口虽然有所下降，出口可能面临更大压力。
Under the impact of the epidemic, although imports have declined, exports are likely to come under greater pressure.
由于复工时间明显推迟，即使某些地区复工，但受到供应链断裂、人流阻碍和隔离、生产防护物资缺乏，以及可能的订单流失等影响，出口制造业将面临较大压力。
Export manufacturing will come under greater pressure from the disruption of supply chains, obstruction and isolation of people, lack of production protection materials and possible loss of orders, even if work resumes in some areas, due to significant delays in the resumption of work.
作为一个参照，非典期间，2003年一季度曾经出现贸易逆差10.2亿美元，这是当时1994年有数据之后的第2次季度逆差。
As a point of reference, the first quarter of 2003 was marked by a trade deficit of $1.02 billion, the second quarterly deficit since 1994, when data were available.
作为一个比较，2002年一季度的贸易顺差为72.7亿美元。
By way of comparison, the trade surplus for the first quarter of 2002 was $7.27 billion.
目前来看，中国在今年一季度贸易顺差可能出现大幅下滑，甚至不排除转向逆差。
For now, China's trade surplus is likely to fall sharply in the first quarter of this year, without even ruling out a shift to deficit.
美国方面启动公共卫生紧急状态，禁航和停办签证等举措，也将减少中国从美国进口商品和服务的渠道。
The launch of a public health emergency, a ban on flights and the suspension of visas will also reduce China's access to goods and services from the US.
中美第一阶段协议当中约定，2019年中国在服务贸易方面的进口，应比2017年增加128亿美元。
The first phase of the deal provides for an increase of $12.8 billion in Chinese imports of services in 2019 compared with 2017.
而服务贸易方面，最重要的就是旅游业。
The most important aspect of trade in services is tourism.
根据美国国家旅游办公室（NTTO）的数据：2017年中国赴美游客达到峰值，随后在贸易冲突的背景下，2018全年、2019年前三季度，中国赴美游客同比分别下降5.7%、4.7%。
According to the US National Tourism Office (NTTO), Chinese tourist arrivals to the US peaked in 2017, and then fell 5.7% in 2018 and 4.7% in the first three quarters of 2019, against the backdrop of trade conflicts.
而这次疫情，将使2020年全年的中国赴美游客数量，在2019年的基础上进一步出现下降。
The outbreak will further reduce the number of Chinese tourists to the United States over the course of 2020, compared with 2019.
2020年2月初，达美航空、美联航、美国航空均暂停了美国往返中国内地的所有航班，时间将持续到3月末甚至4月末。
In early February 2020, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and American Airlines suspended all flights to and from China until late March or late April.
这将影响到中国游客前往美国的商务出差及旅游，从而减少第一阶段协议中我承诺对美国的服务业进口。
This will affect business travel and travel by Chinese tourists to the United States, thereby reducing the services imports I promised to import into the United States under the first phase of the agreement.
假定赴美游客人均花销不变，那么在服务贸易项下，2020年中国赴美旅游的支出将较2017年下滑21.4%，这将中国减少从美国购买旅游服务75.5亿美元。
Assuming no change in per capita spending on visitors to the US, under trade in services, Chinese tourism to the US will fall by 21.4 per cent in 2020 compared with 2017, which will reduce China's purchases of tourism services from the US by $7.55 billion.
同时，还将影响到保险等相关金融服务。
At the same time, it will affect related financial services such as insurance.
显然，这将使中国实现服务业采购承诺的难度大大上升，而且这些新的约束条件主要来自美国方面的限制措施。
Clearly, this will make it much more difficult for China to meet its services procurement commitments, and these new constraints stem mainly from US-imposed restrictions.
此外，客机航班的停飞，也将影响到客机腹仓运输的联运服务，从而减少中国从美国进口高附加值产品。
In addition, the suspension of passenger aircraft flights will also affect the intermodal services of passenger ship intermodal transport, thereby reducing China's imports of high-value-added products from the United States.
当然，客机腹仓运输占比较小，所以影响不大，但如果货运航空和船运受到影响，则中国将难以正常执行进口承诺。
Of course, the impact is small because of the small size of its bellies, but if cargo flights and shipping are affected, it will be difficult for China to properly implement its import commitments.
供给方面，中国推迟复工已经对全球供应链产生冲击，可能对美国企业的出口交货能力产生影响。
On the supply side, China's delay in resuming work is already having an impact on global supply chains and could have an impact on the export delivery capacity of United States companies.
武汉是中国四大乘用车基地之一，世界汽车零部件20强有一半落户武汉。
Wuhan is one of China's four major passenger car bases, the world's top 20 auto parts half of Wuhan.
此外，延迟复工的范围远超武汉，涉及行业也更为广泛。
In addition, the scope of delayed resumption of work far beyond Wuhan, involving the industry is also more extensive.
国内制造业的供应链已经受到冲击。
The domestic manufacturing supply chain has been hit.
德国博世集团已经发出预警，如果疫情持续时间较长，其全球供应链将会中断。
Germany's Bosch Group has warned that its global supply chain could be disrupted if the outbreak continues for a long time.
事实上，韩国现代已经暂停了一款重要车型的生产，并计划逐步暂停韩国的整车生产线。
In fact, Hyundai has suspended production of an important model and plans to phase out its entire vehicle line.
日产也将停止部分生产线。
Nissan will also stop some production lines.
从美国方面来看，汽车工业约有15%的零部件依赖于中国供应商，智能手机、笔记本电脑等电子产品的比例更是在50%或以上。
In the U.S., the auto industry relies on Chinese suppliers for about 15% of its parts, and electronics such as smartphones and laptops account for 50% or more.
推迟对美采购具有可能性第一阶段协议中也给出了疫情的适用条款。
Postponement of the Possibility of Purchasing from the United States The first phase of the agreement also gives applicable provisions for the outbreak.
协议指出，“如因自然灾害或其他双方不可控的不可预料情况，导致一方延误，无法及时履行本协议的义务，双方应进行磋商。
The agreement states that "the Parties shall enter into consultations if unforeseen circumstances, such as natural disasters or other unforeseen circumstances beyond the control of either party, delay the fulfilment of the obligations of this Agreement in a timely manner."
”鉴于疫情已经对中国经济产生了巨大的不可抗冲击，美方也为此启动了公共卫生紧急状态、承认了这种冲击具有严重性和不可控性，因此中美双方可基于此探讨一阶段协议推迟执行的可能性。
Given that the epidemic has already had a huge impact on China's economy, the US side has also initiated a public health emergency, recognizing the severity and uncontrollable nature of such an attack, on the basis of which China and the US could explore the possibility of postponing the implementation of the one-stage agreement.
对于疫情可能导致一阶段协议推迟执行，美国政府和社会舆论已经有一定的心理准备。
The US government and public opinion are already somewhat prepared for a possible delay in the implementation of a phase of the agreement.
纽约时报、福布斯等媒的评论均指出了这种可能性。
Comments in the New York Times, Forbes and others point to this possibility.
2月4日，美国总统特朗普的首席经济顾问拉里·库德洛(LarryKudlow)在接受福克斯商业新闻网采访时也指出“由于中国的疫情，实现一阶段协议中的出口增长可能需要更长的时间”。
On February 4, Larry Kudlow, US President Trump's chief economic adviser, told Fox News: "Because of the Chinese epidemic, achieving export growth in a one-phase agreement may take longer."
应将疫情转化为合作契机避免疫情使双边关系紧张升级，将疫情转化为合作契机。
The outbreak should be turned into an opportunity for cooperation to avoid escalation of tension in bilateral relations and turn the epidemic into an opportunity for cooperation.
一阶段协议推迟执行，中国进口进度不及预期，可能使特朗普政府在美国国内面临更大的舆论压力，激化双边关系紧张气氛，加大双方的第二阶段谈判难度。
The delay in implementing the one-stage agreement and the slower-than-expected pace of Chinese imports could increase pressure on Trump's administration within the US, exacerbate tensions in bilateral relations, and make the second phase of negotiations between the two sides more difficult.
为此，可以基于疫情冲击的现实情况，优先落实医疗用品等相关协议内容的执行，并在保证我方正常权益的情况下，推动双方在延伸领域的技术合作和人员交流，将疫情转化为双边的合作契机，积极扩展双边合作领域。
To this end, we can give priority to implementing the contents of relevant agreements such as medical supplies on the basis of the reality of the epidemic impact, promote bilateral technical cooperation and personnel exchanges in this area while ensuring our normal rights and interests, turn the epidemic into an opportunity for bilateral cooperation and actively expand bilateral cooperation.
