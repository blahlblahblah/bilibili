全国确诊病例增长率重回下降通道，海外疫情处在加速扩散阶段文 |《财经》数据研究员徐进 图 |《财经》视觉中心 编辑 | 谢丽容郝洲一、累计确诊病例：全国总病例数有望控制在8万例左右截至2月27日24:00，31个省（自治区、直辖市）和新疆生产建设兵团累计报告确诊新冠肺炎病例78824例，新增病例327例。
The rate of increase in confirmed cases nationwide has returned to the downward trend. & # 160; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 160; & nbsp; & # 160; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;
二、新增病例：非湖北地区回归下降轨道，武汉平台拉锯图1国内非湖北地区27日新增病例9例，北京回到零新增。
2. New cases: non-Hubei region return to the downward trajectory, Wuhan platform pull saw figure 1 China's non-Hubei region 27 new cases 9, Beijing back to zero new.
河北1例，还是张家口。
One case in Hebei province was Zhangjiakou.
四川4例。
4 cases in Sichuan.
再来分析一下北京26日的10例新增病例。
Let's look at the 10 new cases reported in Beijing on February 26.
根据新京报披露，此10例病例均为24日确诊病例（此传染案的1号病例）的密切接触者，确诊前全部处在集中隔离观察状态。
According to the Beijing News, all 10 cases were close contacts of 24-day confirmed cases (the first case of the infection), all of which were under intensive quarantine observation before diagnosis.
目前新病例100%来自被隔离者，说明隔离是有效到位的。
At present, 100 per cent of new cases are from isolated persons, indicating that segregation is effectively in place.
1号病例18日出现咳嗽症状，23日诊断为疑似，24日凌晨确诊，至26日已锁定密切接触者178人，并全部集中隔离，力度也是相当大的。
Case No. 1 showed symptoms of cough on the 18th, was diagnosed as a suspect on the 23rd day, was diagnosed in the early morning of the 24th, and 178 people had been locked in close contact with them by the 26th day.
从新京报信息可以进一步看出，1号病例于2月3日-2月9日与此案0号病例有过密切接触。
It can further be seen from the Beijing News that case No. 1 was in close contact with Case No. 0 between February 3 and February 9.
0号病例2月7日出现呼吸道症状，9日返回廊坊，不久后确诊。
Case No. 0 showed respiratory symptoms on 7 February, returned to Langfang on 9 February and was diagnosed shortly thereafter.
有些遗憾的是，河北方面未能与北京联手更早将此案1号病例锁定为密接而加以隔离，当然这个要求也许过高。
Unfortunately, Hebei's failure to work with Beijing to isolate Case No. 1 earlier by locking it up may be too high a requirement.
希望接下来此案病例不再继续增加，即使增加也都在已经隔离的密切接触者中。
It is hoped that the number of cases will not continue to increase in the future and even then will be in close contact with those already isolated.
那样我们就可以说此案的传染扩散已被及时有效阻隔，局面完全在掌控之中。
Then we can say that the spread of the case has been effectively and timely blocked, the situation is completely under control.
再来说四川的4例新增病例。
And then there are four new cases in Sichuan.
这4例均出自甘孜州道孚县。
All four cases were from Dawu county, Kanzi State.
根据甘孜州卫健委的公开发布信息，4例病例均为该州在2月17-19日集中大排查中发现并在定点医院集中隔离医学观察的无症状感染者或密切接触者。
According to information publicly released by the Kardze State Sanitary Committee, all four cases were asymptomatic infected persons or close contacts who were found in the State's intensive search on 17-19 February and were centrally quarantined at designated hospitals.
此数据反弹应属前期存量病例消化，而非异常。
This data rebound should be the previous stock of cases digestion, not abnormalities.
甘孜州卫健委的公告称这4人所有排查到的密切接触人员均在隔离医学观察，后续异常爆发的可能性不大。
A statement from the Kardze Health Commission said all the close contacts the men had identified were being quarantined for medical observation and the likelihood of a subsequent abnormal outbreak was low.
图2湖北非武汉地区下降为5例，首次回到个位数，湖北大多数市州已实现零新增。
Fig. 2 Hubei non-Wuhan area dropped to 5 cases, the first time back to single digits, Hubei most of the city states have achieved zero new.
孝感从26日的15例降为1例，异常“警报”解除。
Filial piety decreased from 15 cases on the 26th to 1 case, and the abnormal "alarm" was removed.
图3武汉新增略降，但还不能判定走出“震荡平台”。
Fig. 3 Wuhan added slightly lower, but can not determine out of the "shock platform."
三、确诊病例增长率：回归下降轨道图4全国确诊病例增长率重回下降通道。
III. Rate of increase in confirmed cases: return to the downward trajectory Figure 4. National rate of increase in confirmed cases
四、密切接触者追踪，湖北追踪力度艰难提升图5湖北数据显示其追踪力度持续提升，主要体现了武汉的顽强努力。
Close contact tracing, Hubei difficult to improve tracking strength Figure 5 Hubei data shows that its tracking intensity continued to improve, mainly reflects the tenacious efforts of Wuhan.
非湖北地区维持在30以上。
Non-Hubei area remained above 30.
图6该存量继续下降，不断释放医疗资源、社会人力资源和隔离空间。
Figure 6 shows that the stock continues to decline, freeing up medical resources, social human resources and isolated spaces.
五、疑似病例：湖北下降图7波动下降，符合预期。
Suspected Cases: FIGURE 7 FIGURE 7 IN HUBEI DOWN VULNERABLE AND FURTHER WITH EXPECTION.
图8疑似存量平稳下降。
Figure 8 shows a steady decline in suspected stocks.
六、在院治疗人数：继续释放医疗资源，武汉资源状况已完全逆转图9在院治疗人数存量下降，成规模释放病床床位。
In-hospital treatment: continue to release medical resources, Wuhan resource situation has been completely reversed Figure 9 The number of people in hospital treatment fell, a large-scale release of beds.
“湖北确诊未入院”人数也继续下降。
The number of people diagnosed as unhospitalized in Hubei also continued to decline.
七、重症率下降，病死率缓升、治愈率以更快速度上升图10.1病死率自2月上旬以来持续缓升，基本符合疫情中病死率正常变化周期。
The rate of serious illness has declined, the fatality rate has risen slowly and the cure rate has been rising at a faster rate. Figure 10.1 The fatality rate has been rising slowly since early February.
但在湖北特别是武汉，也有救治措施不到位因素。
But in Hubei, Wuhan in particular, there are also factors that are not in place.
2月24日，中央应对新冠肺炎疫情工作领导小组会议指出，武汉要落实分类收治措施，尽最大努力降低病死率。
On February 24, the Central Leading Group Meeting on the Response to the New Crown Pneumonia epidemic pointed out that Wuhan should implement classified treatment measures and do its utmost to reduce the fatality rate.
2月27日该小组会议再次强调从全国调集资源帮助武汉加强重症患者治疗。
On 27 February, the panel again emphasized the mobilization of resources from across the country to help Wuhan scale up the treatment of critically ill patients.
图10.2重症率明显下降。
Figure 10.2. Significant decline in severity.
武汉近一周来下降尤为明显。
Wuhan has fallen particularly sharply in the past week.
图11治愈率以更快速度上升。
Fig. 11 The cure rate is increasing at a faster rate.
八、新增确诊和新增治愈剪刀差继续扩大图12.1图12.2新增确诊病例数和新增治愈病例数剪刀迅速扩大，资源持续释放，武汉的救治资源紧缺状况出现根本好转。
The number of newly diagnosed cases and the number of new cured cases. The scissors have expanded rapidly, resources continue to be released, and the shortage of treatment resources in Wuhan has fundamentally improved.
九、海外新增病例加速扩散，韩国是重点依据WHO的统计和韩、日、伊、意等主要国家各自发布的数据，（截至北京时间9:00），海外疫情处在加速扩散阶段。
The ROK is focusing on statistics released by the World Health Organization (WHO) and other major countries such as the ROK, Japan, Iraq and Italy. (As of 9: 00 Beijing time), the overseas epidemic is at an accelerated stage of spread.
图13.1图13.2疫情全球分布主要状况如图13.2，目前中国以外值得重点关注的国家主要有韩国、意大利、伊朗等，其中以韩国的病例增长最为突出。
Figure 13.1 The main global distribution of the epidemic is shown in Figure 13.2, with South Korea, Italy and Iran being the main countries of focus outside China, with the most significant increases occurring in South Korea.
此外，受意大利疫情扩散的影响，德国、法国、西班牙昨日也都出现明显增长。
In addition, Germany, France and Spain all saw significant growth yesterday as a result of the spread of the Italian epidemic.
图14.3小结：国内非湖北地区新增病例回归下降轨道，湖北非武汉地区新增趋零。
Figure 14.3 Summary: New cases in non-Hubei areas of China returned to the decline track, Hubei non-Wuhan area added to zero.
海外疫情加速扩散。
The spread of overseas epidemics accelerated.
