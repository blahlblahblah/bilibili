能被救助的宠物是幸运的，有刚出生的小猫崽死在了猫砂盆中，有宠物猫从不慎打开的阳台“跳”了下去……两周的时间里，武汉市小动物保护协会收到了1500条求助信息，它们是另一群等待救援的生命。
Fortunately for the animals to be rescued, there were newborn kittens who died in the litter pan, cats that accidentally opened the balcony, and... In two weeks, the Wuhan Society for the Protection of Small Animals received 1,500 calls for help, another group of lives waiting to be rescued.
全文4816字，阅读约需9.5分钟“求助！因为‘封城’回不去，我的猫现在困在家里，即将断水断粮，求好心人上门帮忙，需要撬锁。
My cat is now stuck at home, running out of water and food, asking the kind people to come to help and pry the lock.
”“我和家人都要被隔离了，家里两只狗狗求喂，要不狗狗只能等死了。
"My family and I are going to be quarantined and our two dogs are begging to be fed, or the dog is going to die.
”……武汉市小动物保护协会的“上门喂养互助”QQ群里，每天都有几十条这样的求助信息。
"" Wuhan Small Animal Protection Association "door-to-door feeding mutual assistance" QQ group, every day there are dozens of such help information.
协会工作人员和其他爱心人士在群中获取相关信息，根据情况上门救助。
Association workers and other caring people in the group to obtain relevant information, according to the circumstances of home help.
从1月26日到2月9日，协会共收到了约1500条求助信息，但这只是“冰山一角”。
The association received about 1,500 calls for help between January 26 and February 9, but it was just the tip of the iceberg.
春节前，很多宠物主人没想到疫情来得如此迅猛，仅预留了几天的粮食。
Before the Spring Festival, many pet owners did not expect the outbreak to come so quickly, only reserved a few days of food.
疫情暴发后，他们大多无法及时返回。
Most of them were unable to return in time after the outbreak.
这些被疫情困住的留守宠物，成了另一群等待救援的生命。
These pets left behind by the outbreak have become another group of life waiting to be rescued.
▲1月26日，武汉市小动物保护协会公众号发布消息，提供上门救助留守宠物服务。
January 26, Wuhan Association for the Protection of Small Animals released news, providing home help left-behind pet services.
网络截图━━━━━意料之外的“重任”最开始，武汉市小动物保护协会会长杜帆没有想到，他们要担起救助留守宠物的“重任”。
2007-9-24 16: 55 [hide] Du Fan, head of the Wuhan Small Animals Protection Association, did not expect that they would shoulder the "heavy responsibility" of saving their pets.
过年前，武汉市小动物保护协会公众号后台就收到了很多留言，希望过年期间协会能提供一些有偿上门喂养服务，但考虑到自身是公益组织，杜帆团队婉拒了这些要求。
Before the Chinese New Year, the backstage of Wuhan Small Animals Protection Association received a lot of messages, hoping that during the Chinese New Year, the Association can provide some paid door-to-door feeding services, but given that he is a public welfare organization, Du Fan team declined these requests.
1月23日，武汉下达“封城令”。
January 23, Wuhan issued a "closure order."
“封城”消息出来后，协会公众号后台留言就“爆炸”了。
"Sealing the city" after the news, the association's public backstage message "exploded."
杜帆说，好多人留言表示，本来只给家里的猫狗留了两三天的食物，计划早点回来，现在“封城”了就回不来了，家里的宠物面临渴死或饿死的危险。
Many people left messages saying they had only left food for two or three days for their dogs and cats, and planned to return early.
看到这些留言之后，团队意识到了事态的严重性。
After seeing the messages, the team realized the seriousness of the situation.
“要不要上门救助留守宠物？团队最开始讨论了很长时间。
"Do you want to come to the rescue of your pets? The team had a long discussion at the beginning.
”起初质疑的声音很大。
The voice of doubt was loud at first.
团队一部分人坚决反对上门救助，觉得风险大，一方面担心上门救助如果被传染，谁都担不起责任；另一方面，如果有志愿者在别人家里偷拿东西，协会还要“背锅”。
Some people on the team are adamantly opposed to door-to-door help, feeling risky. On the one hand, they worry that no one can bear the responsibility if the door-to-door assistance is infected.
但在杜帆和一部分人的坚持下，还是决定要做。
But in Tu Fan and some people's insistence, or decided to do.
“这么特殊的时期，还有这么多顾虑的话，就什么都做不了。
'At such a special time, and with so much to worry about, nothing can be done.
作为武汉唯一一家有合法身份的动保组织，这个时候必须站出来。
Wuhan as the only legal status of the movement protection organization, this time must stand up.
”于是，在大年初二（1月26日），团队在公众号发布了《猫狗留在武汉的主人们，可以联系我们》的消息，征集留守家中无人照看、健康情况不可控的动物信息，并建立了针对汉口、汉阳和武昌的三个疫情期间应急群。
So, on January 26, the team posted the news of "Cats and Dogs Remain in Wuhan, Can Contact Us," in the Public Journal, seeking information on animals left unattended and in an uncontrollable state of health, and set up emergency response groups for the Hankou, Hanyang and Wuchang epidemics.
“消息发出去后没几分钟，三个群就全满员了，我们就意识到这个问题可能没那么简单。
"Within minutes of the news, the three groups were fully staffed, and we realized that the problem might not be that simple.
”最开始，协会只有8个人在做相关工作，后来又招募了60个人。
At first, only eight people worked on the project, and then 60 were recruited.
“现在有68个人在做这件事，主要是整理大家上传的求助信息，然后按紧急顺序挨个跑。
"There are 68 people doing it right now, basically sorting out the help messages that people upload and then running one by one in urgent order.
”杜帆说。
"said Du Fan.
但实际的求助量远远大于68个人力所能及的范围。
But the actual volume of help is far beyond the reach of 68 people.
因此杜帆便建立了一个互助QQ群，征集各界志愿者。
So Du Fan set up a mutual help QQ group, collecting volunteers from all walks of life.
第一个互助QQ群，几天之后便3000人满员，截至2月10日，第二个互助QQ群也有了近1500名成员。
The first mutual help QQ group, a few days later the full force of 3,000 people, as of February 10, the second mutual QQ group has nearly 1,500 members.
在互助QQ群中，一半是求助人，另一半则是当地的各种志愿者，包括无偿上门喂养的市民、有偿提供开锁服务的师傅、无偿捐赠猫狗粮的爱心人士等。
In the mutual help QQ group, half are for help and the other half are local volunteers of various kinds, including unpaid door-to-door feeding citizens, paid masters of unlocking services and loving people donating cat and dog food free of charge.
就这样，68个协会成员和几千名志愿者便组成了一个“团队”，为留守宠物提供帮助。
In this way, 68 members of the association and thousands of volunteers form a "team" to help pets left behind.
除武汉之外，北京、上海、广州、深圳、南京、杭州等地也出现了大量留守宠物无人喂养的状况，各地爱心机构纷纷组建求助救助群，希望在这一危急时刻提供帮助。
Apart from Wuhan, a large number of left-behind pets have been left unfed in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Nanjing and Hangzhou. Loving organizations from all over the world have organized help groups in the hope of helping them in this critical time.
“出于对动物的喜爱，希望能在这个特殊的时期尽一份力。
"Out of love for animals, I hope to do my part at this particular time.
”自愿加入“留守宠物互助组”的杭州市民迟先生说。
"Hangzhou Citizen Chow, who volunteered to join the left-behind Pet Mutual Aid Group, said.
▲上门救助时，协会成员会全程录像或跟求助人视频连线。
Home help, the association members will be the entire video or video link with the help.
受访者供图━━━━━“撬锁”“铲屎”“倒上半个月的粮”上门救助留守宠物实际上并不像听起来那么简单。
2007-9-24 16: 55 [hide] "Pry Lock" "Pour Half a Month of Food" Door-to-Door Remediation for pets left behind is not as simple as it sounds.
据杜帆介绍，若需要通过协会救助，宠物主人需要先填写一个表格，介绍自己的情况，再拿着身份证录一段授权协会上门救助的视频。
Du said that if the need to help through the association, pet owners need to fill out a form to introduce their situation, and then take an identity card to record a video authorizing the association to come to the rescue.
拿到求助者以上信息之后，协会会通过优先级别及紧急程度去判断哪个宠物要先去救助，哪个还可以“缓几天”。
After getting more information from the caller, the association determines which pet should be helped first and which should be "delayed for a few days," according to priority and urgency.
拿到主人授权、排好优先级之后，下一个问题来了，很多家庭都不是密码锁或者也未在武汉地区留有备用钥匙，湖北地区快递又停发，那怎么进门呢？“只能撬锁。
After getting the authorization from the owner and setting the priority, the next question comes. Many families are not password-locked or have left a spare key in Wuhan.
”经求助人同意后，协会成员会联系开锁师傅，共同前往求助人家里。
With the consent of the person seeking help, the association members will contact the master and go to the helper's home.
上门施救的同时，团队成员会全程录像，或者跟求助人视频连线，让主人全程看得到。
At the same time, team members will be the entire video, or with the help of the video link, so that the owner can see the entire process.
进了家门之后，协会成员会去检查家中宠物的健康情况，为其清理排泄物、铲猫砂，加满食物和水。
On entering the house, the members of the association check the health of their pets and clean up their excrement, shovel cat litter and fill them with food and water.
在多个救助拍摄的视频中，记者看到，很多求助人家的猫砂盆已经堆满了排泄物，用各种盆装的粮食与水也都所剩无几。
In many of the rescue videos, the reporter saw that many of the help of the cat litter basin has been filled with excrement, with a variety of pots of food and water left.
“我们一般会留给宠物半个月的粮食，如果求助人备的粮食不够的话，协会会无偿提供狗粮或者猫粮。
"We usually give our pets half a month's supply of food, and if they don't have enough food, the association gives them dog or cat food free of charge.
”杜帆说。
"said Du Fan.
救助中，人力是一个大问题。
In rescue, manpower is a big problem.
一次援助的“标配”，至少要有开锁师傅和两名协会成员。
A "standard allocation" of aid would require at least one unlocked master and two union members.
“两个人以上可以互相监督，出现问题比较好解决。
"Two or more people can monitor each other and problems are easier to solve.
但现在这个特殊时期，愿意出来帮忙的开锁师傅也少之又少。
But at this particular time there are few unlocks available to help.
”杜帆说。
"said Du Fan.
即使凑齐了三个人，救助时还要克服“出行难”。
Even if three people are assembled, the rescue will have to overcome the "difficult journey."
1月23日，武汉市城市公交、地铁暂停运营；1月24日，武汉全市网约出租车停止运营，巡游出租车单双号限行；1月26日，除部分车辆外，武汉中心城区区域机动车禁行。
On January 23, Wuhan city public transport and subway operations were suspended. On January 24, Wuhan city about the network of taxis stopped operation, patrol taxis, single-digit restrictions; January 26, except for some vehicles, Wuhan central urban areas of motor vehicles banned.
绝大多数志愿者由于没有车辆，救助范围局限在自己家附近三四公里，靠步行或者骑自行车前往求助人家中。
The vast majority of volunteers, who have no vehicles, are confined to three or four kilometres from their homes and go to help by walking or cycling to help.
杜帆说，有一位叫叶子的妈妈，为了救助一只困在家中的宠物猫，带着孩子步行了十公里。
Tu Fan said a mother named Leaf walked 10 kilometers with her child to help a cat trapped at home.
协会里的68名成员，每天大概能跑五六十户。
The 68 members of the society can run about fifty or sixty houses a day.
但巅峰时期，每天的求助量就高达两三百件。
But at its peak, there were two or three hundred calls a day.
“从初二到现在（2月9日），后台求助的登记量大概1500件，现在解决了约1200件。
"From the second day of junior high to the present (Feb. 9), the number of backstage calls has grown from about 1,500 to about 1,200.
除了协会内部解决的救助之外，还有大量求助通过互助群直接沟通解决。
In addition to the assistance provided by the associations themselves, there is a great deal of recourse to direct communication through mutual help groups.
”▲被救助的留守宠物猫。
"The rescued cat stayed behind.
受访者供图━━━━━“跳楼”的猫家住武汉市洪山区的冶先生，是互助群的“活跃成员”之一。
2007-9-24 16: 48 The cat family lives in Hongshan area of Wuhan city and is one of the "active members" of the mutual help group.
封城后，冶先生大概救助了十余只留守宠物。
After sealing the city, Meiye probably rescued a dozen pets left behind.
“看到群里的求助信息在家附近的话，就会去帮忙。
"If you see help in the group near home, you can help.
”让冶先生印象深刻的，是2月8日上午的一次救助。
It was a succour on the morning of February 8 that impressed Monsieur le Maire.
求助人家有两只猫急需喂食。
Two cats were in desperate need of food.
冶先生到求助人居住的小区后，被保安拦了下来，问询其进小区的目的。
Meiye to help people to live in the community, was stopped by security guards, asked about its purpose into the community.
告知详情后，保安告诉他，“前几天有一只猫从19楼‘跳’了下来，死了，但一直没人认领。
After telling him the details, the security guard told him, "The other day a cat jumped down from the 19th floor and died, but no one claimed it.
”听到这个消息，冶先生立刻跟求助人要来了两只猫的照片。
On hearing the news, Mademoiselle Baptistine immediately sent for photographs of two cats with the person who had appealed to him.
保安看了后认定，“跳楼”的猫是求助人饲养的一只布偶猫。
The security guard looked at it and decided that the cat that jumped out of the building was a puppet cat raised by people asking for help.
带着“噩耗”，冶先生到了求助人家中。
With the "bad news," the gentleman went to help people.
家中一片狼藉，只看到一只猫，阳台的门开着。
The house was in a mess, except for a cat whose balcony door was open.
另一只布偶猫在无人照看的情况下，从阳台的窗户“跳”了出去。
Another Muppet cat jumped out of the balcony window without anyone looking after it.
得知自己的猫“跳楼”后，求助人非常自责，后悔没把猫带回家过年。
After learning that their cat "jumped", the help of very self-reproach, regret not to take the cat home for the New Year.
自责、后悔，是很多求助人的心理状态。
Self-reproach, regret, is the psychological state of many people who ask for help.
武汉市硚口区的小明也是互助群的救助人之一，已经上门救助了五六次。
The city of Zhengkou City Zhangkou Xiaoming is also one of the mutual help groups, has come to the rescue five or six times.
一次救助时喊猫咪名字没应答，找遍房间也没看着猫咪。
A rescue call cat name did not answer, looking around the room did not look at the cat.
情急之下，主人同意将床垫床板掀开，发现猫咪藏在其中，还活着。
In case of emergency, the owner agreed to open the mattress bed board, found the cat hidden in it, alive.
“是不幸中的万幸了。
"" It was a blessing in disguise.
”能被救助的宠物，是幸运的。
A pet that can be saved is fortunate.
由于断水、断粮或者其他原因，杜帆团队碰到过十几只宠物死在家里的情况。
Due to lack of water, food or other reasons, Du Fan's team has encountered more than a dozen pets died at home.
“再拖一段时间，情况可能会更严重。
"Things could get worse if we put it off for a while.
”1月30日，协会成员上门救助一只怀孕猫妈妈，来到求助者家里时，看到一只加菲猫妈妈正在生产，刚出生的两只小猫崽已经死在了猫砂盆中。
A mother cat who was pregnant came to her home on Jan. 30 to find a mother Garfield giving birth and her two newborn kittens had died in a litter pan.
“这是我们第一次遇到死去的小动物，大家都很难过。
"It was the first time we had met a dead animal and everyone was sad.
”最后，协会成员在征求主人同意后将两只死去的小猫崽“处理好”。
Finally, the association's members "disposed of" their two dead kittens after seeking the owner's consent.
除了常见的宠物猫狗，杜帆团队还接受了一些异宠上门喂养的求助，有小香猪、蜥蜴、鸟、金鱼、兔子等。
In addition to the usual pet cats and dogs, Du Fan's team also received a number of pet door-to-door feeding help, such as small pigs, lizards, birds, goldfish, rabbits, etc.
2月初，协会就救助了一只名叫“屁屁”的小香猪。
In early February, the association rescued a little pig named "Asshole."
小香猪在家留守了12天，协会赶到时发现它被关在阳台，食物、水都没了，放粮的盆都被啃烂了。
Pig stayed at home for 12 days, the association arrived to find it was locked in the balcony, food, water, grain basin were eaten.
“它见到我们特别兴奋，发出了一声奇特的叫声。
He was so excited to see us that he let out a strange cry.
”救援人员把水添满后，小香猪立即把头伸进水中，足足喝了5分钟，“肯定是渴坏了。
"When the rescuers refilled the water, the pig dipped its head into the water and drank it for five minutes.
”协会内部统计，90%的求助者都是在武汉工作的外地人，一般租房住。
According to the association's internal statistics, 90 percent of the applicants are foreigners working in Wuhan, usually renting.
“因为回老家过年，就把宠物留在了家里，但是受疫情影响，回不来，也找不到亲戚朋友帮忙。
"I left my pet at home for the New Year because of my hometown, but I couldn't go back and find any friends or relatives to help me.
没办法，只能由我们来帮忙。
There's no choice but for us to help.
”▲宠物长期留守，家中一片狼藉。
Pets stay behind for long periods of time, leaving their homes in ruins.
受访者供图━━━━━告急的宠物粮“我们现在最大的困难，即将面临断粮的风险。
2007-9-24 16: 55 [hide] The greatest difficulty we have now is the imminent risk of starvation.
”杜帆说，协会的宠物粮食都是年前的囤货，这些库存即将告急。
Du said the association's pet food stocks, which had been stocked up years ago, were running out of steam.
存在断粮风险的不仅是武汉市小动物保护协会，武汉市内十余家救助组织和爱心机构都面临着同样的处境。
It is not only the Wuhan Association for the Protection of Small Animals that is at risk of losing grain, but a dozen relief organizations and charity organizations in Wuhan face the same situation.
“宠物基地都建在郊区、农村，但很多地方封了路，物资进不来。
"Pet bases are built in the suburbs, in the countryside, but many places are blocked and supplies are not available.
”“我们很多人甚至动用个人关系，找熟人帮忙，也没办法，东西就是运不进来。
"Many of us even use our personal connections to get help from acquaintances, but we can't get things in.
”武汉市外的物资也进不来。
Materials from outside Wuhan are not allowed in.
杜帆说，武汉市外的爱心人士想捐赠猫粮狗粮，都因为交通等方面的原因，无法实现。
Tu Fan said that outside Wuhan, the loving people want to donate cat food and dog food, because of traffic and other reasons, can not be realized.
亚洲动物基金机构就曾提出帮助协会及当地十多家动保团体筹集猫狗粮，预计捐赠10000斤，但要等到交通恢复才能送达。
Animal Foundation of Asia has offered to help the association and more than a dozen local sports groups raise food for cats and dogs. It is expected to donate 10,000 pounds but will not arrive until traffic returns.
2月10日，复工第一天，多家快递公司正式宣布全面复工，但受疫情影响，湖北地区的正常快递运输并没有恢复。
February 10, the first day of resumption of work, a number of express delivery companies officially announced full resumption of work, but affected by the epidemic, Hubei region has not resumed normal express transport.
电商平台上多家售卖猫粮狗粮的商家表示，湖北地区暂时无法发货。
Electric trading platform on a number of cats and dogs food vendors said Hubei region temporarily unable to deliver goods.
一家浙江店铺的店主告诉记者，“基本上都发不了湖北，快递都停了。
A store owner in Zhejiang told reporters, "basically can not send Hubei, express has stopped.
”在物资告急的情况下，协会和宠物主人开起了脑洞，用各种食材自制猫粮狗粮，将即食面条弄断做成猫砂……他们希望，通过这些临时的应急办法先度过这段时期。
In case of emergency, the association and pet owners opened a brain hole where they made cat and dog food from a variety of ingredients and broke instant noodles into cat litter.
除了告急的物资，另一个让救助人员“头疼”的是，随着各个社区封闭式管理措施的收紧，顺利进入求助人的小区也成了一件难事。
In addition to emergency supplies, another "headache" for aid workers is that, as communities tighten up their closed management practices, it becomes difficult to get into the communities where they seek help.
杜帆告诉记者，他们多以“晓之以理动之以情”的方式，与安保人员和社区工作者交涉。
Tu Fan told reporters that they often "repeated the sentiment" way, with the security personnel and community workers.
“沟通时间有时候会比较长，我们会说清楚受业主委托救助留守宠物，如果宠物死在家中会成为安全隐患，后果可能无法设想。
"The communication time can sometimes be long, and we will make it clear that pets left behind by their owners may become a safety hazard if they die at home, and the consequences may be inconceivable.
”通过百般游说，大部分安保人员和社区工作者都会让救援人员进入小区，但也有遇到闭门羹的时候。
Through extensive lobbying, most security and community workers have allowed aid workers into the area, but have also been shut down.
杜帆希望，能有更多人理解和配合他们的救助工作。
Du Fan hopes that more people will understand and cooperate with their rescue work.
▲面对“不速之客”，有的宠物会显得比较惊慌。
In the face of "intruder," some pets will appear more panic.
受访者供图━━━━━被“误伤”的宠物除了宠物独自留守问题外，疫情下，宠物是否会感染并传播新冠病毒同样成了一个问题。
2007-9-25 09: 48 Pets Left Behind by Pets Apart from the problem of pets staying alone, the question of whether pets can contract and transmit the new crown virus is also a problem in an epidemic situation.
疫情暴发初期，“宠物会染上新冠病毒”“宠物会传播新冠病毒”……诸如此类的说法开始蔓延。
In the early days of the outbreak, "pets get the new crown virus" and "pets spread the new crown virus..."
全国不少地方开始出现弃养、“处理”宠物的现象。
Many parts of the country began to abandon, "deal with" the phenomenon of pets.
杜帆告诉记者，仅仅武汉地区，他们就看到了很多遗弃宠物的情况。
Du Fan told reporters that Wuhan alone, they have seen a lot of abandoned pets.
上海嘉定一位市民也表示，近期在家附近经常能看到猫的尸体，“是被摔死的，我看到过五六只了。
A resident of Jiading, Shanghai, said the body of a cat was often seen near his home recently. "It was a fall and I saw five or six.
”除了宠物主人“不理智”的行为之外，有关部门也“担忧”了起来。
In addition to the "irrational" behavior of pet owners, authorities are "worried."
西安大白杨东社区1月30日下发通知称，面对严峻的疫情，即日起本小区禁止私养宠物。
Xi'an Tai Baiyang East Community issued a notice on January 30, in the face of a severe epidemic, this area is banned from private pet.
凡私养狗、猫等宠物的业主，应顾全大局立即对家中宠物自行处置。
Owners of pets such as dogs and cats should take care of the overall situation and dispose of their pets at home immediately.
如有顶风违犯，一经发现，由未央区公安分局打狗队强制捕杀，并处罚业主。
If there is a top wind violation, once found, by the uncentral District Public Security Bureau to beat the dog team to kill, and punish owners.
通知发出后，引发小区居民和部分社会公众不满，社区随后撤除了通告。
After the notice was issued, community residents and parts of the community were dissatisfied, and the community subsequently withdrew the announcement.
1月30日，江苏无锡一房主在尚未被确诊，隔离观察期间，其宠物猫被社区工作人员活埋。
A landowner in Wuxi, Jiangsu province, was buried alive by community workers on January 30 while under quarantine observation.
社区工作人员称，根据重大突发事件一级响应机制和社区群众强烈要求，把猫给“处理”了。
Community workers said the cat was "handled" in response to a major emergency level response mechanism and strong community demand.
但事实上，目前尚无证据表明宠物会感染并传播新冠病毒。
But in fact, there is no evidence that pets can infect and transmit the new crown virus.
李兰娟院士在接受央视采访时曾表示，如果宠物没有接触病人和疑似感染者，宠物本身是健康的，那没有关系。
Academician Li Lanjuan told CCTV that if pets do not have contact with patients and suspected infected people, the pet itself is healthy, that does not matter.
如果宠物跑到外面接触到疫情，或者接触到被感染的人，宠物也要监控起来。
Pets are also monitored if they come out into contact with the outbreak or come into contact with infected people.
湖北省2月3日召开的第十三场疫情防控例行发布会上，国家卫生健康委员会专家组成员蒋荣猛也表示，目前为止，没有发现宠物感染冠状病毒传播给人，也没有发现病人传染给猫和狗的情况。
Jiang Rong-jong, a member of the expert group of the National Health Council, also said at the 13th regular briefing on February 3 in Hubei Province that no case of infection of the coronavirus has been found in pets or transmitted to cats and dogs.
针对“宠物是否会传播新型冠状病毒”，世界卫生组织早在1月29日就指出，目前没有证据显示狗猫等宠物会感染新型冠状病毒。
As early as January 29, the World Health Organization (WHO) said there was no evidence that pets such as dogs and cats could be infected with the new coronavirus.
这一问题牵动着很多像杜帆这样从事小动物保护的工作者的心。
The issue touches the hearts of people working on small animal protection like Du Fan.
“目前没有任何证据表明宠物会感染或者传播病毒，不要因为一些谣言，让更多无辜的小生命受到牵连。
"There is no evidence that pets can infect or transmit the virus, so don't let rumors get into more innocent lives.
”杜帆说。
"said Du Fan.
“希望大家在特殊时期爱护好自己的宠物，不要遗弃自己的宠物，更不能让它们绝望地死在自己熟悉的家中。
"I hope you take good care of your pets in special times, don't abandon your pets, and don't let them die in despair in their familiar homes.
