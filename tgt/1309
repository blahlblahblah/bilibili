作者 | 闫丽娇 唐亚华 孟亚娜金玙璠 黎明 孔明明 苏琦编辑 |周昶帆春节返乡人口多、医疗卫生条件有限、防控意识薄弱，很多农村地区变成了防控死角。
Yan-Lijiao Tang Ya Meng Yuan Fan Dawn Kong Ming Ming Suqi editor and Changfan Spring Festival returns home, limited health conditions and weak awareness of prevention and control, turning many rural areas into dead zones.
1月26日，中央应对新型冠状病毒感染肺炎疫情工作领导小组会议上，明确指出了要高度重视农村疫情防控。
January 26, the Central Government to respond to the new coronavirus infection pneumonia leadership team meeting, clearly stated that the prevention and control of rural diseases should be given high priority.
新冠肺炎疫情还在进一步蔓延，疫情爆发以来，尽管多地取消了庙会、集会等春节活动，村委会也在积极宣传“春节期间禁止走访亲友”，一些乡镇甚至已经封路，但仍有农村的长辈没有足够重视，不戴口罩、不听劝告，正常走访亲友、大摆宴席。
Since the outbreak of the outbreak, despite the cancellation of temple fairs, rallies and other Spring Festival activities, village committees are actively promoting the ban on visiting relatives and friends during the Spring Festival. Some townships have even closed the roads, but there are still rural elders who do not pay enough attention, do not wear masks, do not listen to advice, normal visits to relatives and friends, feast.
有些村民认为，自己离武汉较远，而且村里人口流动性不强，在地理上有足够的安全感。
Some villagers believe that they are far away from Wuhan, and the village population is not very mobile, in the geographical sense of security.
也有人觉得，没有公布本村的确诊病例，疫情和自己没有关系。
There was also a feeling that the confirmed cases in the village had not been made public and that the outbreak had nothing to do with itself.
但越来越多的村镇已经重视起来。
But more and more towns and villages have been attached importance to.
在河南周口，村书记要从早上4点工作到晚上12点，时刻监控疫情动向；河南信阳，有村镇调来了挖掘机，在进村路口设下屏障，其他地区的村镇也正在采取封路措施；湖北荆门和荆州，村民们完全不重视的意识正在发生变化......春节期间，燃财经采访了湖北、河南、河北等7个乡镇的村民，希望通过他们，了解到更多农村防疫的真实情况。
In Zhou Kou, Henan Province, the village secretary will work from 4 a.m. to 12 p.m. to monitor the epidemic situation at all times. In Xinyang, Henan Province, excavators have been set up in villages and towns, and blockades are being set up in villages and towns in other areas.
现在不知道还能不能回家各方都在统计我王子恒 20岁 河北省定州市某村村民我是武汉理工大学大三学生。
I don't know if I can go home or not. Everyone is counting on my prince, Heng 20, from a village in Dingzhou, Hebei Province.
去年12月，我还在武汉，疫情已经有预兆，但当时没有重视，我们寝室像以前一样出去吃饭、玩。
Last December, I was in Wuhan, the outbreak of the disease has been foreboding, but at that time did not attach importance to, as we used to go out to eat, play.
1月12号，我们各自启程回家，我当天从汉口抵达定州，然后家里开车接我回了县城。
On January 12, we left for home separately. I arrived in Dingzhou from Hankou on that day and drove me home to the county seat.
直到回家后几天，1月20号左右，武汉新型肺炎的消息铺天盖地，我被动接收消息，才开始关注。
A few days after returning home, around January 20, Wuhan, the news of the new pneumonia, I passively received the message, just began to pay attention.
我仔细回忆，从离开武汉到现在半个月时间，我没有出现任何发热、胸闷、头疼、打喷嚏的情况，而且每天熬夜不吃早饭，出门穿得薄，仍然没有患病。
I recall very carefully that in the half month since I left Wuhan, I have not had any fever, tightness in the chest, headaches or sneezes.
这几天真正见识到国家力量了，我是平时谁也不会关注的小角色，只因为在武汉读书。
These days really see the power of the state, I am usually no one will pay attention to the small role, just because of Wuhan study.
三十（24日）、初一（25日）这两天我回农村老家，照常串门。
Thirty (24), Junior (25) these two days I returned to my hometown in the countryside, as usual.
各方面都在打电话给我和我身边的人。
People are calling me and the people around me.
大年三十早上，高一文理分班前班主任和同学打电话问候我，小区居委会问我妈我的情况。
In the morning of New Year's Eve, the head teacher and classmates called me to greet me, the neighborhood committee asked my mother about my situation.
大年初一，小区居委会、小区物业让我妈务必控制我不让出门，小区所在城西村村委会打电话给我姥爷让控制住我。
On New Year's Day, the neighborhood committee, residential property let my mother must control me not to go out, the village council in the West Village called me to let control of me.
初三（27日）早上再次被高中所在城市教育局七点多打电话询问近况。
Day 3 (27) morning was again high school where the city education bureau more than 7 call to inquire about the latest situation.
我爸也在被要求统计我（的情况），因为我爸是老家村委会的人。
My dad is also being asked to count me up because he's from the village council back home.
因为疫情，我爸从初一下午就开始加班忙这事，县里开会、村里开会，初二上午用电脑列出来了一份巡逻表，把村里的壮年男子分了二十个小队，分队巡逻。
Because of the epidemic situation, my father began to work overtime from the afternoon of the junior high school, the county meeting, the village meeting, the morning of the second day of a computer out of a patrol table, the village Zhuang men divided into 20 teams, sub-patrols.
我现在（接受采访时）在从老家回县城的路上，路过几个村子，有的已经用挖掘机搬大石头把村口封死了。
Now, on my way back from my hometown to the county seat, I pass by several villages, some of which have used excavators to lift large stones to seal the entrance to the village.
我不知道还能不能从老家农村回县城了。
I don't know if I can go back to the county from my hometown country.
我怕我再不回去，就回不去了。
I'm afraid I won't be able to go back again.
我县城家里所在小区已经戒严，不让进车，我目前已经过了十四天病毒潜伏期，但不知道能不能进小区。
My county home community has been cordoned off, I have passed the virus incubation period of 14 days, but I do not know whether can enter the community.
如果能回到家，我就不出门了，各方面都在统计我。
If I can get home, I will not go out, all aspects of the statistics me.
网络上消息太多太乱了，我个人现在只相信国家正规权威部门发布的消息，和我在武汉接触过的朋友的话。
There is so much confusion on the Internet that I personally only believe what the state authorities have published and what my friends in Wuhan have said.
别的，家人群里转发的，微博、贴吧、抖音、快手上的任何个人消息我完全不信。
Else, I don't believe any personal information forwarded by family members, microblogs, stickers, jingles, or any personal information on hand.
个人狭隘的信息接收渠道，加上大部分人受教育程度不高，对待这种国家重大事件没有任何经验，所以任何个人言论可信度都太低。
The narrow channels through which individuals receive information, coupled with the low level of education of the majority and the lack of any experience in dealing with such national events, make any personal statements too credible.
这期间我个人也收到了很多同学、朋友的关怀，非常感谢大家，我身边人对我完全没有什么异样的态度，因为我很健康，这几天见的朋友、家人也没有那种苛责嘴毒的。
During this period, I also received a lot of concern from my classmates and friends. Thank you very much. People around me have no different attitude towards me at all, because I am very healthy.
我个人承诺在今后几天，我自己除非万不得已，不会出家门，保护别人也保护自己。
I personally promise that in the next few days I will not leave my house except as a last resort to protect myself and others.
从早上4点工作到晚上12点目前我也只能做到这样刘先生 50岁 河南省周口市某村村书记我是我们村的村书记，2002年下半年上任，上任没多久正好赶上非典。
Mr. Liu is 50 years old. I am the secretary of a village in Zhou Kou City, Henan Province. I took up my duties in the second half of 2002, just in time to catch up with SARS.
非典那时，所有返乡人员都要先送到村里的一个学校进行隔离，当时隔离时间是7天。
At the time of SARS, all returnees had to be sent to a school in the village for isolation, which was seven days.
我觉得现在跟非典那时候很像。
I think it's a lot like SARS at the time.
今年我是1月21日接到镇上的通知，当时所有村书记下午6点钟赶到镇去开“疫情防治大会”。
This year I received a notice from the town on January 21st when all the village secretaries arrived at the town at 6: 00 p.m. to hold an epidemic prevention and control conference.
会议通知我们，根据新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎指挥部办公室的通知和疫情实际情况，所有村都要严把各关卡，做到有指挥棚、有值守、有记录，24小时坚守，吃饭轮流换班。
The meeting informed us that according to the notification of the pneumonia command office of the new coronavirus infection and the actual situation of the outbreak, all villages should strictly control the checkpoints, conduct command post, watch and record them, stick to them 24 hours a day, and change shifts at meals.
没有十分特殊情况的人员、车辆不准出，让我们严格遵照执行。
No personnel or vehicles under very special circumstances shall be allowed to leave. Let us strictly abide by them.
如果有武汉返乡人员或者接触过武汉人的返乡人员，要居家隔离14天，设立台账，每天测量体温，有承包人和责任人专门负责。
If Wuhan returning personnel or those who have come into contact with Wuhan people, they shall be separated for 14 days at home, set up accounts, take temperature every day, and have contractors and responsible persons in charge.
如果期间有发烧，立刻上报上级疫情防控中心。
If you have a fever, immediately report to the upper epidemic prevention and control center.
回到村里之后，我们村上的乡村医生和村干部总共9个人开始彻夜排查。
Back in the village, a total of nine village doctors and village cadres began a night-long search.
外出返乡人员，不管从哪个地方回来，只要是在最近20天内返乡，都要在家里和家人一起自我隔离。
Returnees, wherever they return from, who have returned within the last 20 days, are separated from their families at home.
因为即使他们不是从武汉回来，也有接触到武汉人的风险。
Because even if they did not come back from Wuhan, there is a risk of contact with Wuhan people.
在这个过程中，我们会挨家挨户去劝说大家不要害怕，这个病毒目前可防御，大部分人能理解我们的工作，再加上电视、网络也一直在提醒大家不要出门，要戴口罩，如果有人自己跑出来，我们的干部会跟着他进行监督。
In the process, we will go door-to-door to persuade people not to be afraid, the virus is currently defensible, most people understand our jobs, and television, the Internet have been reminding everyone not to go out and wear masks, and if someone runs out, our cadres will follow him.
乡村医生每天会进行体温测量和排查，普通的发烧感冒也需要汇报。
Village doctors take temperature measurements and screenings every day. Common fevers need to be reported.
村里的广播从早上5点钟开始播放需要注意的要点，比如不走亲戚、出门戴口罩、勤洗手等，一直播到下午结束。
The village radio broadcast the main points that needed attention from 5 a.m., such as not visiting relatives, wearing masks, washing hands, etc., live until the end of the afternoon.
我们还会开着宣传车挨家挨户去宣传，也会在村里张贴海报，多方宣传和动员。
We will also drive from house to house in propaganda vehicles, and we will put up posters, multiparty publicity and mobilization in the villages.
村里墙上张贴的举报海报 来源/受访者村里的疫情宣传车来源/受访者村里张贴的宣传标语 来源/受访者从1月26日开始，每天下午5点半，我们还需要准时跟县委书记和其他县干部开远程电话会议，收听最新的动态和工作指导，比如他们会通知我们做好宣传、不要引发群众恐慌、做好自己的防护措施等。
Source of Report Posters / Source of Outbreak Publicity Cars in the Village / Source of Propaganda in the Village / Source of Propaganda Posters in the Villagers / Source of Propaganda / Interviewees Posters in the Village Starting from 26 January, we also need to hold teleconferences with county secretaries and other county officials on time to listen to the latest developments and work instructions.
现在群众也逐步意识到问题的严重性，自己会自觉不多出门、不走亲戚，出门戴口罩已经成为了每个人的常识。
Now that the masses have come to realize the seriousness of the problem, they will not go out much, do not go to relatives, wearing masks has become everyone's common sense.
目前村里暂时还没有发现从武汉回来的返乡人员，群众大多数比较服从安排，整体状况还算稳定。
At present, the village has not found returnees from Wuhan, the majority of the masses more submissive arrangements, the overall situation is relatively stable.
这几天，我们9个人每天早上4点钟起床，开会、安排工作，然后开始在村里宣传、排查，等到半夜12点之后确认村里路上没人后，再回家休息，每天的工作时间没有限制，争取把隔离工作做扎实。
These days, nine of us get up at 4: 00 in the morning, hold meetings, organize our work, and then start to advertise and sweep the village, wait until after midnight to make sure that no one is on the village road, then go home for a rest.
家人也会担心我，但我会做好防护措施，目前我的力量只能做到这样。
My family will worry about me too, but I'll take precautions, and that's all I can do at the moment.
虽然外界现在有人说我们是不是对武汉返乡人员太冷漠了，有些人也会因害怕而不敢说自己是从武汉返乡的，但事实上这也是为了他个人和家庭健康着想，我们现在能做的就是让他们知道，不要害怕，大家一起度过难关。
Although some people now say that we are too indifferent to Wuhan returnees, some people are afraid to say that they are from Wuhan, but in fact it is also for his personal and family health, we can now let them know, do not fear, everyone through difficulties together.
挖掘机挖土封路退了票安心在家陈凯28岁 河南省信阳市某村村民疫情虽然严重，我们村的人整体上感觉还是理解的，很淡定。
Excavator earth seal the road return ticket peace of mind at home Chen Kai 28-year-old Henan Province Xinyang City villagers although the epidemic situation is serious, our village people as a whole still feel understanding, very quiet.
部分人家里有生意或想出行，稍微有点急。
Some people have business or want to travel, a little bit anxious.
村民的重视程度也很高，我都没怎么说服父母，只是跟他们普及了一些可靠信息。
The villagers were also highly valued. I didn't even talk to my parents much. I just shared some reliable information with them.
村里隔不远就会有喇叭，每天都在播报疫情新闻、防护建议等，整个防控氛围已经很浓了。
The village will soon have a trumpet, daily broadcast epidemic news, protective advice, and so on, the overall atmosphere of control has been very strong.
父母辈的人，不仅会看电视新闻，也经常在手机上刷抖音、快手、微信之类的，相关信息也接触不少。
Parents, not only can watch TV news, but also often brush on the phone shake voice, fast hand, micro-letter and so on, relevant information also contact a lot.
另外，村干部也不断群发信息和短信。
In addition, village cadres are constantly sending messages and text messages.
进村的路已经封了。
The road into the village has been closed.
1月26日上午十点左右，窗外突然传来轰隆隆的机器声。
At about 10 a.m. on January 26, a roar of machinery suddenly came out of the window.
我朝窗外看过去，有一辆正在作业的挖掘机和停在一旁的拖车，挖掘机就地取材，在路边挖土“填路”。
Looking out of the window, I saw a working excavator and a trailer parked beside it, picking up material from the site and digging "fill the road."
挖掘机在封路 来源/受访者路障在距离我们家十来米处的一个丁字路口，分别通向三个村庄，也算是两个乡镇的交界处。
Excavators at the source / interviewee roadblock at a T-junction a dozen meters from our house lead to three villages, which is the junction of two townships.
第一铲的土刚堆好，南方一辆白色的车急驶过来，但在土堆那还是不得不停了下来。
The first shovel of earth had just been heaped up, and a white car from the south came briskly, but it had to stop at the mound.
当时路面还有缝隙，在挖掘机和土堆之间，但它没有“挤”过来的勇气，犹豫了大概两分钟，掉头而去。
There were cracks in the road, between the excavator and the dirt pile, but it did not have the courage to "squeeze" it, hesitated for about two minutes and turned away.
紧接着，更多车开了过来，停下、犹豫、掉头。
Then more cars came along and stopped, hesitated, turned around.
我家和邻居家门口，一时成了停车场，一辆辆由南北而来的车辆依次掉头返回。
In front of my house and my neighbor's house, a parking lot was built for a time, and cars from the north and the south turned back.
不知道是因为我的家乡疫情较重还是我爸的觉悟本身就高，他一直表现得比我还警惕和紧张，之前就已经提前通知在邻市的二姐不要回来。
I do not know because my hometown is more serious or my father's consciousness itself high, he has been more vigilant and nervous than I, had been warning the second sister in a neighboring city not to return.
村里封路后我爸打电话给我在县城的大姐，催她们赶快回家。
After the village blocked the road, my father called my elder sister in the county to hurry them home.
大姐夫妻俩在县城商场经营一家餐厅，1月25日晚上接到通知，原定初二营业的商场，已经暂时延迟到初五开业。
The first sister-in-law and his wife, who run a restaurant in the county mall, were informed on the evening of January 25 that the opening of the mall, originally scheduled for February 2, had been postponed until the fifth day of junior high school.
为此，他们连夜开车赶去县城，把一些生鲜食材收进冰箱，尽量止损。
For this reason, they drove to the county overnight, put some raw fresh food into the refrigerator, try to stop the damage.
紧接着我爸又打了好几个电话，通知更多的亲友放弃出行计划，嘱咐好好待在家。
Then my father made a few more phone calls to tell more friends and relatives to give up the trip plan and ask to stay at home.
封路时邻居大妈站在我家门口，她家就在我家斜对角，此时正隔着挖掘机。
My neighbor's mother stood in front of my house when the road was closed. Her house was diagonally diagonally across the excavator.
她说，我这回家得翻土堆呀。
I've got to dig through the dirt here, she said.
这个路口，四周都有人家，这座“小土山”，正好被五户人家围了起来。
This intersection, all around the family, this "small earth mountain", was just five families surrounded.
若想串门，得先“翻山”。
If you want to visit the door, you have to "climb the mountain."
不过，对于从不串门的我来说，这并不影响。
However, for me who never visits the door, this does not affect.
她跟我聊了几句，言语间有点茫然。
She talked to me for a few moments, and her words were at a loss.
她和丈夫是独居老人，房子位于村边缘。
She lives alone with her husband. The house is on the edge of the village.
若想进村，必先“翻山”。
If you want to enter a village, you must climb a mountain.
我也表示了一点担心：村里老人多，如果谁家老人突然犯病了，自己的车出不去，救护车也进不来。
I also expressed a bit of concern: the village elderly, if the elderly suddenly fell ill, their own car can not get out, ambulance can not get in.
有人站岗，有选择地放行，或许更好一些。
It might be better for someone to stand guard and release selectively.
当然，站岗也不一定是在户外，像这个路口，放点障碍，派个工作人员在邻居家或我家就能“看守”了。
Of course, standing guard is not necessarily in the open air, like this intersection, put a bit of obstacles, a staff member in the neighborhood or my home can "guard."
回到房间，我点开12306，退掉了此前费尽九牛二虎之力抢来的票。
Back in the room, I clicked 12306 and returned the tickets I had taken with a vengeance.
我爸说，我们家的存粮吃一个月都没问题。
My dad said it would be all right for us to save food for a month.
村里干部挨家挨户通知爷爷70大寿取消了凡凡 27岁 湖北省荆门市某村村民我老家是湖北荆门下面的小乡村，我是1月9日回到武汉的，当时正好公司在这边举办了一场活动。
Village cadres went from house to house to inform Grandpa that his 70th birthday had been canceled. Anybody 27 years old from a village in Jingmen City, Hubei Province, my hometown was a small village under Jingmen, Hubei Province.
1月17日活动结束后，我就回了老家。
After the 17 January event, I went back to my hometown.
当时疫情还没有爆发，但回老家时已经有意识地简单预防了，街上大多数戴口罩的也都是年轻人。
The outbreak had not yet broken out, but it had been deliberately and simply prevented from returning home, and most of the street masks were worn by young people.
武汉疫情爆发的初期应该是在19日和20日，这两天陆续有看到新闻公布疫情情况。
Wuhan outbreak of the initial outbreak should be in the 19th and 20th, these two days have seen the news release situation.
但农村防范意识特别弱，我回来的时候，老家基本上没有人在意这件事。
But the sense of precaution was particularly weak in the countryside, and when I returned, few people in my hometown cared about it.
刚开始，我各种劝家里人要注意防护，戴好口罩。
At the beginning, I advised the family to pay attention to the protection, wear a mask.
但不管我说什么他们都不听，甚至觉得我是在吓唬他们。
But no matter what I said, they didn't listen. They even thought I was scaring them.
最后还是村干部说话管用。
Finally, village officials speak louder than words.
年三十的当天村干部戴着口罩挨家挨户通知，春节期间不要有群聚性活动。
Village officials wearing masks on the day of the notification door-to-door, Spring Festival do not have group activities.
老家的人这才意识到了严重性，开始戴口罩。
The people back home realized the seriousness of this and started wearing masks.
赶上武汉封城，今年在江苏的舅舅和幺幺们都没赶回来，家里人虽然不齐，但团年饭还是得准备。
To catch up with Wuhan, this year in Jiangsu did not come back uncle and the family although uneven, but still have to prepare for the Lunar New Year.
受疫情影响，爷爷的70大寿也取消了。
Grandpa's 70th birthday was cancelled due to the epidemic.
村里的情况 来源/受访者按村里习俗，大年初一时会挨家挨户去拜年问好，今年全部取消了，没有任何亲戚来拜年。
Village source / interviewee In accordance with village custom, New Year's Day will go door-to-door greeting, this year all cancelled, no relatives to pay a New Year call.
他们也来不了，村与村之间都封锁了。
They can't come either. The village is closed off from the village.
有村干部盯着进村的几条路，村口都用石头和泥土堆起来不让人和车进。
Village officials stared at several roads into the village, where the entrance was stacked with stones and dirt to keep people and cars out.
说实话，疫情爆发武汉封城之后，我心理上还是有落差的。
To tell the truth, the outbreak of Wuhan after the closure of the city, I still have a psychological gap.
回老家前，我还特意做了个头发，打算回来见见亲朋好友。
Before I returned home, I made a point of doing a hair and wanted to come back and meet my friends and relatives.
结果从武汉回来就自我隔离了。
As a result, he returned from Wuhan and isolated himself.
这个星期，我在家也戴着口罩，吃饭的碗筷也得和家里人分开，找不到人说话，微博一天刷一百遍￼。
This week, I also wear a mask at home, eating chopsticks and family have to separate, can not find people to talk, Weibo brush a hundred times a day.
今天是第一次出门，村里基本上见不到人，路上只见到一个戴口罩的，平时过年路上人来人往的，现在就只有几只喜鹊。
Today is the first time to go out, basically no one in the village, the road only saw a mask, usually people on the road to the New Year, now there are only a few magpies.
村医院门也开着，但是没有人。
The village hospital was open, but no one was there.
村里基本上见不到人了 来源/受访者接到公司通知，我们武汉分公司年后上班延期了，目前是在家办公的状态。
The source / interviewee was informed by the company that our Wuhan branch office had postponed its work for another year and was now working from home.
我几个同学在武汉工作回来都自行隔离了。
Several of my classmates came home from work in Wuhan and isolated themselves.
朋友们大多在武汉工作，也有北上广的，都很无奈，只能在家等公司通知。
Most of my friends work in Wuhan, but also in the north, are helpless, can only wait at home to notify the company.
有个朋友年前刚刚失业，准备开年找工作去的，信用卡呀花呗等着还呢，这下给他急得。
A friend just lost his job a few years ago, ready to start looking for a job in the new year, the credit card ah wait to pay it, this gives him a lot of urgency.
这些天，网上信息太多了，真假信息确实是没办法判断了。
These days, too much information on the Internet, true and false information is really no way to judge.
但社会各界人士捐助和武汉市内民众自发支持，疫情整体已经有所缓解了。
But thanks to donations from all sectors of society and spontaneous support from the public in Wuhan, the epidemic has generally eased.
而且每个省基本上都有确诊病例了，事关人人。
And there are basically confirmed cases in every province, which is a matter for everyone.
我觉得目前对社会能做的最有用的事，就是在家待够15天再出门，随时关注疫情情况，做好有效的防护措施，多喝热水，勤洗手。
I think the most useful thing society can do right now is to stay at home for 15 days before going out, keep an eye on the situation, take effective precautions, drink plenty of hot water, and wash your hands frequently.
农村的防护措施还是太弱了，希望能有更多的人加入到防护疫情队伍中来，和村里领导干部们一起守住村子。
Protection measures in the countryside are still too weak, and it is hoped that more people will join in the protection against the epidemic and join the village leaders in guarding the village.
河南的一些乡镇已经做了很好的示范，我觉得都可以借鉴，走访培训非常重要。
Some of the townships in Henan have done a good demonstration, I think all can learn from, visiting training is very important.
小地方是熟人社会，对当地情况了解但对信息辨别能力弱马欣 29岁 河北省沧州市某乡村民我的家在河北省沧州市一个小镇上，属于农村向乡镇过渡的地段。
I am a villager from Cangzhou, Hebei Province. My home is in a small town in Cangzhou, Hebei Province. It is a section of the transition from rural to urban areas.
我22号回家，当时路上没有几个人戴口罩。
I returned home on the 22nd, when few people on the road were wearing masks.
我一直在关注武汉疫情，所以消息掌握很及时，我跟家里人说这就是非典，刚开始家里人很不在意。
I have been watching Wuhan epidemic, so the news is very timely, I told my family that this is SARS, at the beginning of the family is very unconcerned.
我跟一个哥哥说，让他们赶紧囤点口罩，北京都买不到了，但他根本没听进去，他还开玩笑说，“要不我去北京倒卖口罩去。
I told one of my brothers that Beijing couldn't buy a mask for them to hoard, but he didn't listen. He joked, "Why don't I go to Beijing and trade masks?
”最不在意的是父亲。
"The last thing that mattered was my father.
除夕那天，父亲非要出去拜访一个年长的亲戚，我百般劝说也无济于事。
On New Year's Eve my father insisted on visiting an elderly relative, and all my persuasion was of no avail.
他的理由是：农村亲戚间礼节多，有些长辈要经常走动，要不然就关系淡了。
His reason is that there are many etiquette among relatives in the countryside, and some elders have to walk around often, otherwise the relationship will be weak.
而且他不戴口罩，说是戴着口罩去串门不像那么回事。
And he didn't wear a mask. He said he was wearing a mask to visit the door.
23号武汉封城，关于疫情的消息在接下来两天才正式爆发。
Wuhan, 23, the news of the outbreak did not officially break out until the next two days.
接着听说省里出现了一个病例，镇里的气氛顿时就紧张起来了。
Then I heard that there was a case in the province, and the atmosphere in the town suddenly became tense.
陆陆续续有亲戚打电话过来，说春节不走动了，电话拜年就可以，大家都开始警惕了，这个时候父亲才打消了出去走动的念头。
A relative gradually called to say that the Spring Festival did not move, telephone call on the New Year can, everyone began to be vigilant, this time his father just gave up the idea of walking.
乡镇村里的人们，对消息真实性的辨别力很弱，谣言在这里有相当大的市场，就比如海外势力阴谋论啥的。
People in rural villages have little discernment for the veracity of news, and rumors have a considerable market here, like conspiracy theories about foreign powers.
最夸张的是，省里出现病例后，有人在村里说，中央要派飞机过来，在空中喷洒消毒药。
Most exaggeratedly, after the case in the province, someone in the village said that the central authorities would send planes over to spray antidote in the air.
初二的时候，听说镇里开完会了，接着外边广场上的大喇叭就开始响了，一个上午都在呼吁大家不要出门，不要走亲戚拜年了，不要去人群集中的地方。
On the second day of junior high school, I heard that the town had finished its meeting. Then the big trumpet began to ring in the square outside.
接着就看到镇里的酒店、饭店、棋牌室、澡堂子全都关门了，村里的小路也都封上了。
Then all the hotels, restaurants, chess rooms and baths in the town were closed, and the village lanes were closed.
小地方是熟人社会，当地人对地方情况相当熟悉。
Small places are known to the local community, which is quite familiar with the local situation.
当封锁开始后，监控从外地回来的人就成为所有人的共同任务。
When the blockade begins, it becomes the common task of all to monitor those who return from the outside world.
如果有人从外地来，消息马上就在当地传来了，大家会更加警惕。
If someone comes out of the field and the news comes immediately from the ground, everyone will be even more alert.
但总体而言，我们当地对疫情的防控措施还是很有序和文明的。
But in general, our local control measures against the epidemic are very orderly and civilized.
官方应该公布确诊病例的具体村镇防止盲目乐观崇明 30岁 湖北省荆州市某村村民荆州距武汉差不多两三个小时车程，荆州与武汉之间有大量的人口流动。
Officials should report specific villages and towns where confirmed cases have been confirmed to prevent blind optimism Chongming, 30, from a village in Jingzhou, Hubei Province, is nearly two to three hours' drive from Wuhan.
就目前来看，宣传有一定效果，但村民重视程度算不上太高，好在防范意识正在不断提高。
At present, publicity has some effect, but the villagers do not attach too much importance to it, but fortunately the awareness of prevention is constantly increasing.
村子层面，目前有3项措施：除夕前完成了所有返乡人员登记；广播每天循环播放注意事项，让大家不要串门，禁止红白喜事等一切聚餐活动等，包括一些通知；整个镇对外的道路基本都被封了。
At the village level, there are currently three measures: the registration of all returnees was completed by New Year's Eve; broadcasting daily circulars to warn people not to visit the door and to ban all meals, including red and white festivities, including some announcements; and the closure of roads outside the town.
我们村旁就有一条出镇的路，相当于出村的路也被封了。
There was a way out of town next to our village, and the equivalent of a village road was blocked.
我们这边也有春节回娘家的习俗，现在回娘家的路被堵了。
We also have the custom of returning home for Spring Festival, now the road back to her home is blocked.
出村的路被封了 来源/受访者村里面平常接触的外界信息不多，我家旁边有个喇叭。
The way out of the village was blocked The source / interviewee had little information about the outside world and there was a loudspeaker next to my house.
疫情出现后，村里增加了广播频次。
The frequency of broadcasts increased in the village after the outbreak.
总的来说，宣传有一定效果。
In general, advocacy has had some effect.
我们这边其实有很多从武汉回来的亲朋好友。
In fact, we have a lot of friends and relatives back from Wuhan.
农村人闲来无事就喜欢互相串门、唠嗑，今年春节，大家基本没有任何线下往来，都是线上微信拜年。
Rural people like to visit each other in idle, nagging, this Spring Festival, we basically do not have any offline exchanges, are on-line micro-letter.
我发小就住我家隔壁，我也一直没去和他打招呼。
I lived next door to my family when I was a kid, and I never said hello to him.
包括从城里回来的亲戚，只是吃个饭，待一两天就走了。
Including relatives from the city, just eat a meal, stay for a day or two and leave.
如果是武汉回来的人，大家都会很敏感。
If Wuhan is back of the people, we will be very sensitive.
从城里回来的人也担心他们会把疫情带进村，因为荆州也有几十例确诊了。
People coming back from the city are also worried that they will bring the outbreak into the village because dozens of cases have been confirmed in Jingzhou.
但总体上我的感觉是村子里多数人还是不够重视。
But on the whole my feeling is that most people in the village still don't attach enough importance to it.
我们村比较空旷，不像城市那么密集，住户相对分散，人员流动也不大，地理上有一定安全感。
Our village is relatively empty, not as densely populated as the city, relatively scattered and sparsely populated, and geographically secure.
也有焦虑的，更多人的焦虑带着开玩笑性质，有点自嘲，他们觉得尽管身在湖北，还是离自己很遥远。
There are also anxious, more people's anxiety with a joking nature, a little self-mockery, they feel that despite being in Hubei, or very far from themselves.
因为虽然官方公布了确诊总人数，但我们其实并不知道都是分布在哪。
Because although the official total number of confirmed cases, we do not really know where the distribution is.
有时候也会有一些流言传出来，没法确认。
Sometimes there are rumors that can't be confirmed.
我建议，应该写清楚确诊的人，都是来自哪个镇哪个村。
I suggest that people who are clearly identified should be clearly identified, from which town and from which village.
有村民开始佩戴口罩 来源/受访者当然，大家的防御意识也在变化。
Some villagers are beginning to wear masks. / Interviewees: Of course, people's sense of defense is changing.
我刚回来时，除了我非常重视，村子里其他人没有一个戴口罩的，也没有其他防护措施。
When I first came back, no one else in the village was wearing a mask, and no other protection was available, except for the importance I attached to it.
随着武汉封城和镇上封路，村民意识发生了非常大的转折。
With the closure of Wuhan city and town, the awareness of villagers has taken a very big turn.
腊月二十九，我去离我们最近的集市买口罩，已经买不到了。
On the 29th of December, I went to the nearest bazaar to buy masks. I couldn't buy them.
过完年，超市和集市上连菜也买不到了，很多商户也都没有出摊。
After the New Year, supermarkets and bazaars can not even buy vegetables, many merchants have not been out of the booth.
我今天竟然看到有几个人开始戴口罩了，这么多年还是头一次。
Today, for the first time in years, I saw a few people start wearing masks.
村干部在各个微信群发送了疫情预防语音父母一下子听进去了张建 30岁 河北衡水某村村民我家在河北省南部，距离北京约300公里。
Village cadres in the various micro-letters sent the epidemic prevention voice parents immediately listen to Zhang Jian30-year-old Hebei Hengshui village villagers in my home in the southern Hebei Province, about 300 kilometers from Beijing.
今年因为疫情，我选择打顺风车回家，原本火车3小时的路程，花了我整整一天。
This year, because of the epidemic, I chose to take a ride home, the original three-hour train journey, took me a whole day.
回老家的时候，村口已经用土堆起了厚厚的“障碍拦”，有专人看守，阻拦和登记陌生车辆，不是本地车都不让进，相当于半封村了。
Back home, the village had built a thick "barrier" with dirt, someone to guard, stop and register strange vehicles, not local cars are not allowed to enter, the equivalent of half a village.
村里设置疫情检查站 来源/受访者在家待了两天之后，村里的卫生室开始挨家挨户登记流动人口个人信息。
After two days at home, the village clinic began to register the personal information of the floating population door to door.
村口挂起了红色横幅——不聚会，不到公共场所，不乘坐公共交通。
Red banners were hung at the entrance to the village - no parties, no public places, no public transport.
村里的喇叭每天都要广播呼吁减少拜年、家庭聚餐等活动，一天要播好几次。
Village loudspeakers broadcast daily, several times a day, calling for fewer New Year visits and family meals.
和平时的春节相比，按照防疫要求，我家除了上坟烧纸，基本没有任何外出活动，没有更多亲戚往来，也没有家庭聚餐，过年冷清了很多，真的“没有年味”。
Compared with the normal Spring Festival, according to the requirements of epidemic prevention, my family except for the grave burning paper, basically no activities, no more relatives, no family dinner, the New Year cold a lot, really "no age.
我家普遍比较重视疫情的防范，我还给爸妈准备了口罩和消毒洗手液，但是村内别的人家，口罩佩戴率还是不高。
My family generally pay more attention to the epidemic prevention, I also prepared a mask and disinfectant hand sanitizer, but other families in the village, the wearing rate of masks is still not high.
我在家庭群也分享了疫情新闻，科普了其严重程度。
I also shared the news about the epidemic in my family group, and the science popularized its severity.
在说服父母方面没有费很大力气，只是父亲一开始比较不习惯，说了几次都没有戴口罩，直到初二这天出门上坟，我硬给他戴上了，中途监督了好几次不让他摘。
There was no great effort in persuading his parents, except that the father was not used to it at first, and did not wear a mask several times until I went out to the grave on the second day of junior high school.
最开始父母没听说武汉肺炎疫情，后来通过电视和手机短视频了解到了疫情情况，再后来我强制让他们戴口罩、洗手，教他们做了防护。
At first, my parents didn't hear about the pneumonia in Wuhan, but later I learned about the outbreak through video clips on TV and mobile phones. Then I forced them to wear masks, wash their hands and taught them to take precautions.
其中转折的时间点，是村干部在各个微信群发送了语音，加强了疫情的科普，他们一下子听进去了。
The turning point is that the village cadres in the various micro-letters sent voice, strengthening the epidemic of popular science, they immediately listened to.
之后他们也在密切关注疫情，父亲是通过今日头条客户端里的短视频，母亲则是通过收音机、电视以及微信群，微信群有不少村子和镇里的相关情况，传播速度非常快，甚至哪家店的口罩有黑心价不要去，谁家有武汉回来的人口都一清二楚。
Since then, they have also been closely watching the epidemic, the father through today's front-end clients short video, mothers through radio, television and micro-groups, micro-message groups in a number of villages and towns, the spread of very fast, even which stores have black price masks do not go, who have Wuhan back home population is clear.
非典时期我还在上小学，每天戴口罩、测体温，班主任每天在教室熬醋。
SARS period I was still in primary school, wearing a mask, temperature every day, the head teacher in the classroom boil vinegar.
相比之前，本次疫情的信息传播，短视频的占比应该不低，有与电视等传统媒体分庭抗礼的趋势。
Compared to the previous epidemic, the spread of information, short video should be not low, with traditional media such as television and other trends.
口罩是我之前回家放在家里备用的，购买自电商。
The mask was left at home for my use before I went home and bought from the electrical merchant.
今年春节怕不够用，又分别在淘宝和拼多多上买了一些。
I'm afraid this Spring Festival is not enough, but also in Taobao and more shopping on some.
拼多多买的一包一次性医用口罩，感觉没有涨价但也没发货。
Buy a bag of disposable medical masks, feel no increase in price but did not deliver.
淘宝买了两包，分别是一包医用口罩，未发货；一包防毒防霾口罩，20只208元，发的EMS，速度很慢。
Taobao bought two bags, one for medical masks, not delivered; one for a bag of anti-virus haze masks, 20 for 208 yuan, and the EMS issued was slow.
1月26日3-4点有喷洒杀毒药物的飞机飞过，村干部在微信群中有通知。
On 26 January, at 3-4 p.m., aeroplanes carrying anti-virus drugs flew by, and village officials were notified in a group of micromessages.
当天我就在犹豫观望要不要回京。
That day I was hesitant to wait and see whether to go back to Beijing.
国新办开发布会之前，有少部分朋友已经买票准备回京，初三当天返程的比较多。
Before the opening ceremony, a small number of friends have bought tickets ready to return to Beijing, the third day of more return.
发布会开完，许诺了北京不封城，学校等教育机构延后开学，不少朋友包括我自己也不再着急回京了。
At the end of the conference, we promised that Beijing would not be closed, schools and other educational institutions were postponed. Many friends, including myself, were no longer anxious to return to Beijing.
