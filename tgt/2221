这一天是大年初二，最高气温3度。
It is the second day of New Year and the maximum temperature is 3 degrees.
春节前积压未诊断的新冠肺炎病人，其中一部分已经转为重症，武汉急需医护人员救治病人。
Before the Spring Festival, the backlog of undiagnosed cases of pneumonia, some of which has become serious, Wuhan urgently needs medical staff to treat patients.
头天晚上抵达武汉的北京援鄂医疗队队员们，要适应的不仅仅是没有暖气的武汉寒冬，还有等待着他们的一场苦战——这支医疗队一百多人，要在刚刚征用为新冠肺炎定点收治医院的同济医院中法新城院区开辟“战场”，收治望眼欲穿的武汉新冠肺炎患者。
The medical team from Beijing, which arrived in Wuhan the night before last, has had to adapt not only to the cold winters in Wuhan without heat, but also to a bitter battle waiting for them - a medical team of more than 100 people to open up a "battlefield" in the French-Xincheng hospital, which has just been requisitioned as a designated hospital for new crowns pneumonia.
年初一从北京出发的北京协和医院医疗队医疗队由北京协和医院等6家委属委管医院组成，共一百多人。
The medical team from Beijing Concorde Hospital on Monday consisted of six appointed hospitals, including Beijing Concorde Hospital, with a total of more than 100 people.
北京协和医院第一批援鄂21名医护人员中有感染专业、重症医学专业、呼吸科的专家，而队长刘正印则是协和医院感染科主任医师——一名参与过17年前非典病人救治的“老兵”。
Among the first batch of 21 medical workers in Beijing Concorde Hospital were specialists in infectious diseases, severe medicine and respiration, while captain Liu Zhengyin was the director of infection at Concorde Hospital, a veteran of SARS patients treated 17 years ago.
网友们把北京协和医院等国内著名医院派出的医疗队，称为国家级医疗“天团”，民众和患者对这些国家级的专家们充满期待，而他们也不负期待，承担了大量危重病人的救治重任。
netizens have called the medical teams sent by Beijing Concorde Hospital and other well-known hospitals at the national level. People and patients are full of expectation from these experts at the national level and have shouldered the burden of treating a large number of critically ill patients.
从年初二到达武汉至今，刘正印教授已经在最艰苦的危重症患者救治一线坚守一个多月，刘正印教授和同事们不断总结和调整治疗方案，力争提高危重症患者治愈率。
Since arriving in Wuhan on February 2, Professor Liu Zhengyin has been on the frontline for more than a month, and Professor Liu Zhengyin and his colleagues have been trying to improve the cure rate of critically ill patients by summarizing and adjusting the treatment plan.
刘正印教授在同济医院中法新城院区ICU病房2月25日下午，《新民周刊》对刘正印教授进行了专访，他表示，总结一个多月来危重症治疗经验发现，不能简单地将新冠肺炎看做“肺炎”，因为这种病毒对患者其他器官的伤害，常常成为病人致死的主要原因。
Professor Liu Zhengyin, who interviewed Professor Liu Zhengyin in the afternoon of Feb. 25 in Tongji Hospital, said his experience of critically ill health care for more than a month showed that pneumonia could not simply be regarded as pneumonia because of its damage to other organs and was often the main cause of death.
如果单纯将疾病看做“肺炎”，可能会低估疾病的严重程度。
Viewing disease simply as "pneumonia" may underestimate the severity of the disease.
病毒侵袭多器官造成难治北京协和医院医疗队救治新冠肺炎患者《新民周刊》：您到武汉已经一个月，北京协和医院医疗队管理的都是危重症患者，目前我们对新冠肺炎有哪些新的认识？刘正印：新冠肺炎是个新的疾病，大家对它的认识还处于一个初步的阶段。
2007-3-1 15: 23 2008-12-12 21: 16: 16 The New People's Weekend: It has been a month since you arrived in Wuhan, Beijing Concorde Hospital Medical Team has been managing critically ill patients. What new knowledge do we have about the new crown pneumonia?
这个病可能还有很多的机制我们认识不清楚，但有一点我觉得非常重要：我认为不要把新冠肺炎看做一个肺炎，它是一个病，病毒不但侵犯肺，它还侵犯血管的内皮细胞，导致凝血功能的一些改变。
There may be many other mechanisms for this, but I think it's very important: I don't think it's a pneumonia, it's a disease that not only invades the lungs, but also invades the endothelial cells of the blood vessels, leading to some changes in clotting function.
它侵犯肾脏，肾功能出现异常的特别多。
It invades the kidneys, and abnormal renal function is particularly common.
同时它还侵犯心脏。
It also attacks the heart.
所以它是一个病，不应该单纯叫它“肺炎”。
So it is a disease and should not simply be called pneumonia.
把它看成一个病以后，治疗的时候就要做综合的判断，要比治疗肺炎想得更全面、更深入。
Think of it as a disease, the treatment time to do a comprehensive judgement, than the treatment of pneumonia think more comprehensive, more in-depth.
第一，危重病人的治疗中综合性治疗很重要，综合性治疗包括吸氧、加强营养、纠正电解质等。
First, the treatment of critically ill patients in comprehensive treatment is very important, including oxygen absorption, nutrition, correct electrolytes and so on.
第二，我们看到很多病人出现处凝血化验异常，最后出现DIC（即弥散性血管内凝血，主要临床表现为出血、休克、器官功能障碍和溶血性贫血）的一些问题。
Second, we have seen a large number of patients with local coagulation abnormalities, culminating in some problems with DIC (diffuse intravascular coagulation, mainly clinical manifestations of haemorrhage, shock, organ dysfunction and hemolytic anemia).
所以，对上呼吸机这些病人，要长期的卧床，我们要用低分子肝素这类药物预防血栓的形成。
So, for patients with upper respirator, long-term bed rest, we use low-molecular-weight heparin drugs to prevent thrombosis.
我看到有的病人，脚趾出现坏疽现象，这就是凝血功能的问题。
I've seen patients with gangrene on their toes, which is a problem with clotting.
我们感到，如果判断病人可能由重症转化为危重症，那么就早点用上呼吸机，有可能救回来。
We feel that if the patient is judged to be at risk of serious illness, use a ventilator early and it is possible to recover.
《新民周刊》：最近湖北以外确诊患者病例数不断下降，全国各地支援湖北的医疗队还在增加，ICU病房压力有所缓解吗？刘正印：ICU病房的救治压力没有缓解的迹象。
Recently, the number of confirmed cases outside Hubei has been decreasing, medical teams supporting Hubei are on the increase all over the country, and pressure on ICU wards has eased somewhat?
疫情发生一个多月，武汉还有很多病人，轻症病人可能陆续康复出院了，但还是会有一些病人转成了重症，所以说危重症患者的救治，在武汉还是一个很大的问题。
More than a month after the outbreak, Wuhan still has many patients, mild patients may be coming out of the hospital, but some patients will be turned into serious illness, so the treatment of critically ill patients, in Wuhan is still a very big problem.
《新民周刊》：最早到武汉的医护人员，已经辛苦工作了很长时间，大家状态怎样？会不会换岗？刘正印：我们来武汉的很多护士都比较年轻，有的孩子很小，你说能不想家吗？这是人之常情，一点不奇怪。
It is not surprising that many of the nurses who came to Wuhan are young and some of them are very young. Do you think you can have a family or not?
但目前换岗不太现实，我们尽可能让大家轮流休息一下。
But it is not realistic to change jobs at present. We should take turns to rest as much as possible.
我作为队长多去关心他们，协和医院的大后方在关心慰问家属方面做了许多工作，让我们解除后顾之忧。
I care about them as captain, the Concorde hospital home in caring for the family has done a lot of work, let us ease the worry.
目前护士是4小时一班，医生一般12个小时轮一次，医生分AB两组， A组在病房里的时候B组医生在病房外面协助，这样大家轮一下。
At present, nurses work in shifts of 4 hours, doctors work in shifts of 12 hours, doctors divide two groups of AB, and Group A doctors assist outside the ward while Group A is in the ward, so that everyone can take turns.
隔离服穿太久是不安全的，我们尽量合理安排。
It's not safe to wear in isolation for too long. We try to arrange it properly.
初到武汉，心中非常难过《新民周刊》：年初二您和同事们来到武汉时，是一个什么样的场景？刘正印：我们来的时候，同济医院中法新城院区刚刚腾空，还没有改造好，都是普通病房。
When we arrived in Wuhan, I was very sorry to hear that you and your colleagues had come to Wuhan on the second day of the new year.Liu Zhengyin: When we arrived, the French Xincheng District of Tongji Hospital had just been vacated and had not been renovated, they were all ordinary wards.
像雷神山、火神山这样的新医院，可以按照传染病要求建，但是普通病房改建，肯定不能那么精细，只是在原来的基础上改建，基本符合隔离病房标准就行了。
New hospitals like Raytheon Hill and Mount Fire Goddess can be built according to the requirements of infectious diseases, but the renovation of ordinary wards can certainly not be so fine, only on the basis of the original renovation, basically meet the standards of the isolation ward.
外面有很多病人等着住院，非常急。
There are a lot of patients waiting to be hospitalized, very urgent.
我们医生也参与了病房改造的设计，没有条件也要上，必须改造出来。
Our doctor also participated in the design of the ward reform, no conditions also have to go up, must be reformed.
差不多用了24小时，病房改造一完成，年初四就开始收病人。
It took almost 24 hours. Once the ward was renovated, patients began to be admitted on Thursday.
北京派出的这个医疗队是6家医院组成的，大家一起合作开始收治病人。
The medical team from Beijing is made up of six hospitals, and we all began to work together to treat patients.
一开始接手的50张病床，很快就住满了，指挥部把一批又一批病人送来，有的病情轻一些，有的比较重，危重患者的大概占三分之一。
The initial capacity of 50 beds was quickly filled, and the headquarters brought in groups of patients, some of whom were more serious and some of whom were critically ill, about one third of whom were critically ill.
那时候也来不及做区分，先收进来住院是最急迫的需求。
At that time, it was too late to make a distinction between admission to hospital is the most urgent need.
刘正印教授帮助同事穿防护服《新民周刊》：那个时候，硬件条件、物资保障，都非常艰苦是吗？刘正印：是的，当时条件特别艰苦。
Professor Liu Zhengyin helped colleagues wear protective clothing Xinmin Weekly: At that time, the hardware conditions, the material support, are very difficult? Liu Zhengyin: Yes, the conditions were particularly difficult.
重症患者需要上呼吸机，但上呼吸机对病房条件是有要求的，比如说没有支气管插管需要的正压头罩，病房内氧气管道的压力不足，呼吸机接口不配合等等，这些都是当时的条件，“三个臭皮匠，顶个诸葛亮”，大家集中智慧一起想办法就能解决问题。
Patients in serious condition need a ventilator, but the upper ventilator is required for ward conditions, such as positive pressure cover without bronchial intubation, insufficient pressure of oxygen pipe in ward, uncoordinated ventilator interface, etc. These were the conditions of the day.
病房晚上特别冷，我们北方人非常不习惯。
The ward is very cold at night. We northerners are not used to it.
来武汉之前，北京协和医院赵玉沛院长等院领导就给我们提出，医护人员一定要在保护好自己的情况下才能更好地救治病人。
Before coming to Wuhan, hospital leaders such as President Zhao Yupei of Beijing Concorde Hospital told us that the medical staff must protect themselves so that patients can be better treated.
如果你自己都保护不好，把自己给感染了，你就谈不上来救治病人，还给当地添了麻烦。
If you can't protect yourself and infect yourself, you can't talk about treating the sick, and you're causing trouble in the area.
作为队长压力巨大，所以我们对每个进入病房的队员必须经督导员检查合格在衣服上打上√，才能进入病房；而出病房必须2个人配合、互相监督，按标准程序脱防护设备。
As the team leader is under great pressure, we have to check with the supervisor before entering the ward. Before entering the ward, two persons must cooperate and supervise each other and remove the protective equipment according to the standard procedure.
我是队长，我们来的都是业务骨干，当时是压力挺大。
I'm the captain. We were all in the line of business and we were under a lot of pressure.
不过我经过2003年的SARS的锻炼，有一些经验，可以给大家一些指导。
But I have had some experience with SARS in 2003 and I can give you some guidance.
年轻的医护人员过来时一腔热血，但现实很“骨感”，真的要进病房还是会有恐惧感的，就要鼓励大家，从思想上来战胜恐惧。
Young health care workers come over with a passion, but the reality is "bone feeling," really want to enter the ward or fear, we have to encourage everyone, from the ideological victory over fear.
《新民周刊》：到武汉没几天，北京协和医院医疗队又去开辟一个新的病区是吗？刘正印：到武汉一周以后，我们接到任务，要开辟一个新的ICU病房，从筹建、设计到完工，用了两天时间。
Only a few days after arriving in Wuhan, the medical team from Beijing Concorde Hospital went to open a new sick area.Liu Zhengyin: A week after we arrived in Wuhan, we were asked to open a new ICU ward, which took two days to build, design and finish.
2月4日，由北京协和医院牵头，联合北京医院、武汉同济医院、江苏省医疗队共同建设的联合ICU就正式启用了。
February 4, led by Beijing Concorde Hospital, the United Peking Hospital, Wuhan Tongji Hospital, Jiangsu Province medical team jointly built the joint ICU officially opened.
这是武汉同济医院中法新城院区救治危重症患者的主战场，几乎所有病人都是要上呼吸机的危重病人。
This is Wuhan Tongji Hospital in France Xincheng hospital treatment of critical patients in the main battlefield, almost all patients are on the ventilator critical patients.
2月4日下午5点，我们就收治了第一位患者。
At 5: 00 p.m. on February 4, we admitted our first patient.
三天后，2月7日，北京协和医院第二批142名医护人员增援武汉，至此我们北京协和医院两支医疗队整建制全面独立接管联合ICU。
Three days later, on February 7, a second batch of 142 medical personnel from Peking Concorde Hospital reinforced Wuhan.
《新民周刊》：ICU病房当天就收治了大量病人吗？刘正印：是的。
Xinmin Weekly: Is there a large number of patients admitted to ICU ward that day? Liu Zhengyin: Yes.
ICU病房运转第一天，18个病人中14个病人给气管插管有创呼吸机辅助呼吸。
On the first day of operation of the ICU ward, 14 out of 18 patients were given invasive ventilator-assisted breathing by endotracheal intubation.
当时收治病人秩序比较混乱，我也接到很多求助的电话，希望将病人送到我们这里来，但我很无奈，告诉他们，谁能送到病房来不是我们医生说了算的。
When the patients were in a state of disarray, I also received many calls for help to bring patients to us, but I was helpless and told them that it was not up to our doctors to see who could be delivered to the ward.
那段时间心里常常感到很难过。
At that time, my heart often felt very sad.
那时候有很多的无奈。
At that time, there were many helpless.
比如有的病人需要血液透析，有的要上ECMO， 但设备还没有，有的病人看着好好的，突然就说不行了，又没有有效的办法抢救，非常难受。
For example, some patients need hemodialysis, some to ECMO, but the equipment is not yet available, some patients look good, suddenly said no, and there is no effective way to rescue, very uncomfortable.
而且这个病发展很快，也许有条件也救不过来。
And this disease develops very fast, perhaps the condition also can not save come over.
所以后来我们强调要尽早发现病人，判断哪些轻症病人会变成重症、危重症，这个节点很难判断，但很重要。
So later we emphasized early detection of patients, to judge which patients will become serious, critical disease, this node is difficult to judge, but very important.
不能及时发现这种会转成重症的病人，会耽误很多的治疗的机会。
Failure to detect in a timely manner patients who become seriously ill delays the chances of many treatments.
北京协和医院第二批的同事2月7日晚上六七点到武汉，吃了饭就进病房开始工作。
On Feb. 7, a second group of colleagues from Beijing Concorde Hospital arrived in Wuhan at six or seven in the evening.
病人最多的时候，32个病人中26人上有创呼吸机，你想想这是多大的工作量？到目前为止，新冠肺炎危重患者的治愈率还是不高，从各家重症监护室的情况看，凡是上呼吸机、气管插管的病人，愈后都不好，气管插管的病人死亡率基本上都在40%以上。
At the peak, 26 out of 32 patients had invasive breathing machines. Think about how much work it takes. So far, the rate of treatment of critically ill patients with Newcrown Pneumonia is still low.
危重病人的高死亡率，对于ICU的医生护士来说压力是最大的，危险性也大。
High death rates among critically ill patients are the most stressful and dangerous for ICU doctors and nurses.
刘正印教授与北京协和医院感染科主任李太生教授进入病房前《新民周刊》：来了一个多月，现在ICU病房运转的情况怎样？刘正印：现在我们医疗队专业非常全，覆盖ICU、内科ICU、呼吸与危重症医学科、感染科、心内科、消化内科等多个科室。
Professor Liu Zhengyin and Professor Li Tai-sheng, Director of Infection Department of Beijing Concorde Hospital, entered the ward of Xinmin Weekly: More than a month ago, how is the ICU ward working? Liu Zhengyin: Now our medical team specializes in ICU, internal medicine ICU, respiratory and critical medicine, infectionology, cardiology, digestive medicine and so on.
现在我们的病房里治疗流程都已经规范化了，医护人员对这个工作强度也逐渐适应，我们必须做到忙而不乱，最怕的是又忙又乱又干不出来，这是最麻烦的。
Now that the flow of treatment in our wards has been standardized and the staff are getting used to the intensity of the work, we must be busy and unruly.
必须从传染病疫情中吸取教训《新民周刊》：您经历过非典，再参加新冠肺炎的一线驰援，是不是有很多感慨？刘正印：2003年非典疫情中，北京协和医院在急诊建临时SARS病房，曾经收治40多名患者，我是第一批进非典病房的医生。
You have experienced SARS and then joined the first line of assistance in the SARS epidemic. Liu Zhengyin: During the SARS epidemic in 2003, Beijing Concorde Hospital set up a temporary SARS ward and treated more than 40 patients.
当时大家都知道广东很多医护人员感染、还有死亡的，大家都很恐惧。
At that time, it was well known that many medical workers in Guangdong contracted and died. Everyone was afraid.
有过上一次的经历，这次参加新冠肺炎救治，我没有年轻人们那么恐惧，他们没有经历过，一开始还是紧张的。
I didn't have the same fear as the young people who had the last experience, this time with new crown pneumonia. They didn't experience it, they were nervous at first.
17年后我们国家再次出现这样的传染病疫情，我的一个感慨就是“好了伤疤忘了痛”。
Seventeen years later, my country again such an infectious disease epidemic, one of my feelings is "good scar forgotten pain."
你想一想，非典疫情后，我们建立起了疾控预防体系，还是比较完整的。
You think, after SARS epidemic, we have established a disease control and prevention system, or relatively complete.
但是过了17年之后传染病突然出现，而且新冠肺炎病毒的传染性比SARS强多了，非典时哪里看到过这种无症状的潜伏病人传染人？这是很可怕的。
But 17 years later, the outbreak of infectious diseases, and the SARS virus is much more infectious than SARS, where did SARS see such asymptomatic latent patients infect people? It is terrifying.
所以说没有吸取SARS的教训，更早地做出疫情判断，导致目前的结果，这个是很让人痛心的一个事情。
So it's sad not to learn the lessons of SARS and make an early diagnosis that will lead to the current results.
如果当初出现医护人员感染的时候，就马上重视起来，该怎么办怎么办，不会达到现在这样的程度。
If the emergence of the initial infection of medical personnel, immediately attached importance to, how to do, will not reach the current level.
刘正印教授17年前曾是北京协和医院非典病房首批医生《新民周刊》：疫情发生，我们发现专业的医疗力量还是不多的，这一点未来应该怎么补短板？刘正印：我是感染病专业的医生，传染病是感染性疾病范畴中的一类疾病。
Professor Liu Zhengyin was the first doctor in the SARS ward of Beijing Concorde Hospital 17 years ago. When the outbreak occurred, we found that the professional medical force was still small.
经典的传染病像肝炎等等，我们国家通过多年的防治，新发患者人数已经大幅度下降，这些年，新发的传染病越来越多。
Classic infectious diseases like hepatitis and so on. Through years of prevention and treatment in our country, the number of new infections has dropped dramatically and the number of new infections has increased over the years.
你想想从2003年的SARS，到MERS（中东呼吸综合征），到禽流感、埃博拉，再到现在的新冠肺炎，一个接一个的公共卫生事件出现。
Think of one public health event after another, from SARS in 2003 to MERS, avian flu, Ebola, and now New Crown Pneumonia.
当传染病疫情发生的时候，就必须依靠感染科的医生，从治疗上、预防上来做更多的工作。
When an epidemic of infectious diseases occurs, it is necessary to rely on doctors in the infection department to do more work in terms of treatment and prevention.
我感到国家在这方面的投入还是不够的，如果国家不投入更多的话，将来一旦出现这种突发的传染病事件，还是会手忙脚乱，我们平常的这种准备还是不充足。
I feel that the State's investment in this area is still insufficient, and that our usual preparation will not be sufficient if the State does not invest more in the future in the event of such a sudden outbreak of infectious diseases.
无论是物资还是人才队伍，平常可能用不到，但一定要准备好，备而不用是没问题的，就怕需要的时候没有准备，那就麻烦了。
Whether the material or human resources, may not be used, but must be prepared, prepared is not a problem, afraid of the need for unprepared, that is troublesome.
这次新冠肺炎的救治中也暴露出一些问题，以后我们感染病学科需要大力发展，以应对各种各样的传染性疾病。
The treatment of this new crown pneumonia also exposed some problems, we need to develop the disease in the future to deal with a variety of infectious diseases.
