返工人员日益增加，社区防控成为重中之重。
The number of reworkers is increasing and community control is a top priority.
AI前哨站注意到，苏州、上海、杭州等多个地方的社区用上了“智能封条”，防止居家隔离人员擅自外出。
AI outposts noted that communities in Suzhou, Shanghai, Hangzhou and other places used "smart seals" to prevent people living in isolation from going out without permission.
据了解，“智能封条”使用了物联网、5G等技术，可以监测门的开关状态，一旦出现异常开门，社区人员的手机、电脑终端就会收到提醒。
It is understood that the "smart seals" use Internet of Things, 5G technology, can monitor the door switch status, once the abnormal opening, community personnel's mobile phones, computer terminals will be alerted.
多地社区用智能封条进行精准管理“江苏苏州园区斜塘街道XX幢X单元XXX室发生居家隔离人员开门告警！隔离人员详情：XXX。
Many communities use smart seals for accurate management "XX block X unit XXX street in Suzhou Park, Jiangsu Province door isolation personnel opened the door alarm!
”2月19日，苏州市工业园区斜塘街道网格员尤秀兰，收到了这条来自“智能封条”的提醒。
Yuxiulan, a street grid worker in the inclined pond of Suzhou Industrial Park, received the reminder on Feb. 19 from the "Smart Seal."
尤秀兰负责管理斜塘街道莲花六区的10幢居民楼，春节以来一直在加班。
Ursula manages 10 residential buildings in Lianhua-6, a sloping-pond street, and has been working overtime since the Spring Festival.
之前，社区给居家隔离人员贴的是纸质封条，她每天早晚都要上门查看。
Previously, the community placed a paper seal on the house isolators, and every morning and every night she visited them.
有了智能封条以后，她注意手机提醒就行。
With the smart seal, she just had to pay attention to the cell phone alerts.
据了解，斜塘街道使用的“智能封条”其实是一种门磁监控产品，它以物联网网络为基础，可以监控门的开关状态。
It is understood that the "intelligent seal" used in the street of inclined pond is actually a kind of portal magnetic monitoring product, which is based on the Internet of Things network and can monitor the switch status of the door.
后台系统录入了居家隔离人员的手机号、隔离期限等信息，一旦门磁监控到异常开门，社区人员就能收到通知。
Back-office system has entered the home isolation of the cell phone number, isolation period and other information, once the door magnetic monitoring abnormal door, community personnel can receive notification.
“这样的话其实是更方便了。
"It would have been more convenient.
要是夜里有报警，我赶不过去，也可以快速通知小区物业，让他们上门去看。
If there is alarm at night, I can not get past, can also quickly notify the residential property, let them go to the door to see.
”尤秀兰说，智能封条确实减轻了她的工作压力，居民也都挺配合。
The smart seal did ease her stress at work, and residents cooperated, she said.
除了居民偶尔的误触，她基本上没有收到过来自封条的报警提醒。
She has received few alarm reminders from the seal, except for occasional miscues by residents.
斜塘街道有关负责人告诉AI前哨站，斜塘街道存在大量返苏务工人员，但街道、社区工作人员有限，无法实现对重点疫区来苏人员的24小时居家监管。
The person in charge of the ramp street told AI outpost that there were a large number of workers returning to Soviet Union in the inclined pond street, but there were limited street and community workers who could not provide round-the-clock home supervision of Soviet personnel in key affected areas.
因此，街道便尝试使用智能封条，从2月5日到现在，一共安装了大约100套。
As a result, the streets have experimented with smart seals, and about 100 have been installed since February 5.
居家隔离人员不能出门，要买菜、倒垃圾怎么办？尤秀兰说，街道为居家隔离人员组建了微信群，同时安排网格员和志愿者进行服务。
Stay-at-home isolators aren't allowed to go out, so what to do with food and garbage removal?
隔离人员有什么需要就在微信群里提出来，由尤秀兰和同事上门帮忙。
The quarantiner needs to be brought up in the microphone group, with Ursula and her colleagues coming in to help.
AI前哨站梳理发现，不仅是苏州，上海、郑州、杭州、金华、无锡等全国多个城市的社区也在试点使用智能封条，上海市松江区中山街道甚至一口气安装了1300多套设备。
AI outposts have found that smart seals are being piloted in communities in Suzhou, Shanghai, Zhengzhou, Hangzhou, Jinhua and Wuxi, and more than 1,300 sets of equipment have even been installed in the streets of Zhongshan in the Songjiang district of Shanghai.
这些设备的工作原理大致相同，社区青睐的原因主要是不用插电、不用连无线网、可以重复使用、告警及时。
These devices work in much the same way, the community preferred the main reasons are not plug-in, do not connect wireless network, can be re-used, timely warning.
六成投票者支持社区使用智能封条新冠肺炎疫情发生以来，大数据、人工智能等多种新技术被应用于疫情防控。
Since 60% of voters supported community use of the smart seal pneumonia outbreak, large data, artificial intelligence and other new technologies have been used in disease prevention and control.
对于社区使用智能封条的做法，网友怎么看？AI前哨站就此议题在南都“热点站站队”发起投票活动。
For the community use of smart seals, how do netizens? AI outpost on this issue in the south of the "hot spot station line" launched a voting campaign.
截至2月20日下午，共有2415位网友参与投票，其中“支持”一方有1568票，“反对”一方有847票。
By the afternoon of February 20, 2,415 netizens had voted, of whom 1,568 were for the "yes" side and 847 for the "no" side.
也就是说，64.9%的投票者支持社区的做法。
In other words, 64.9 per cent of voters supported the community approach.
AI前哨站注意到，疫情发生后，使用封条已经成为社区管理居家隔离人员的普遍做法。
AI outposts noted that in the aftermath of the outbreak, the use of seals has become a common practice among communities to manage isolated persons at home.
许多社区虽然没有使用智能封条，但也用了普通的纸质封条。
Although many communities do not use smart seals, they do use ordinary paper seals.
56.7%的投票者认为贴封条能有效起到防控作用。
Sealing was considered effective by 56.7 per cent of voters.
不过，也有28.4%的网友认为，贴封条有一定作用但没必要，属于“防控过度”。
However, 28.4 percent of netizens believe that the seal has a role to play but is unnecessary and belongs to the "over-control."
在进一步的调查中，49.3%的网友认为智能封条比普通纸质封条更好，6%的网友认为两种封条差不多。
In a further survey, 49.3 percent of netizens said the smart seal was better than the regular paper seal, while 6 percent of netizens said the two seals were similar.
还有38.8%的网友选择了“不支持用封条”。

不可否认的是，贴上封条后，居家隔离人员一定会丧失部分的行动自由和隐私。
It is undeniable that after the seal, the home isolation personnel will lose part of their freedom of movement and privacy.
是否应该让居家隔离人员作出权利让渡？网友观点不一。
Netizens disagree on whether to let people living in isolated homes make the right to alienate.
58.2%的网友认为，疫情形势严重，隔离人员应该且有必要作出部分牺牲。

38.8%的网友则认为不应该，隔离人员只要做到戴口罩、勤洗手等科学防控即可。
38.8 percent of netizens said they should not, as long as quarantine personnel wear masks, frequent hand washing and other scientific control can be.
网友“云海”认为，可以倡议可以监督，但不能强制，居民的基本权利要保障。
netizen "cloud sea" thinks, can advocate can supervise, but cannot force, dweller's basic right should safeguard.
“说封上可以相信国家，那不封也应该可以，要相信民众。
'To seal the country, and not to seal it, and to trust the people.
”他说。
'he said.
学者提醒：须征得居民的知情同意，并谨防技术滥用网友们的不同观点背后，其实涉及到新技术应用的伦理问题。
Scholars warn that: must obtain the informed consent of residents, and be careful not to abuse the technology behind the different views of netizens, actually involves the ethical issues of the application of new technologies.
围绕这一问题，AI前哨站请教了两位伦理学学者。
Around this issue, AI outpost consulted two ethics scholars.
“借助技术来取代危险、枯燥、繁重的劳作，体现了技术谋求人类福祉的伦理旨趣。
"Using technology to replace dangerous, boring, heavy labor, reflects the ethical purpose of technology for human welfare.
与此同时，技术发展使得我们开始反思人类的伦理地位与技术的伦理属性、技术在不同场景中的伦理功能，等等。
At the same time, the development of technology makes us reflect on the ethical status of human beings and the ethical attributes of technology, the ethical functions of technology in different scenes, and so on.
”上海交通大学教授闫宏秀认为，智能封条用于疫情防控，是一种特殊的场景伦理案例。
Yan Hongxiu, a professor at Shanghai Jiaotong University, says that the use of smart seals for disease control is a special case of scenario ethics.
对于这样的特殊场景，需要基于通用伦理的基础上结合具体情况来剖析。
For such a special scene, need to be based on the general ethics based on the specific situation to analyze.
她指出，从动机上看，苏州等地使用智能封条的伦理动机是善意的：提醒居家隔离人员，防止疫情扩散。
The ethical motivation for using smart seals in Suzhou and elsewhere, she points out, is well-intentioned: to warn people to stay at home and prevent the spread of the disease.
同时，封条所收集的数据是有限的，通过远程数据获取的方式可以减少避免交叉感染，降低人类成本，有效提升管理与治理的效率。
At the same time, the data collected by seals is limited, and access to remote data can reduce cross-infection, reduce human costs, and improve the efficiency of management and governance.
“从公共安全与治理的角度来看，依法采取一切技术手段确保公共安全是合法的和必要的。
"From the point of view of public security and governance, it is lawful and necessary to take all technical measures to ensure public safety according to law.
”复旦大学教授杨庆峰表示，采用智能封条能够有效掌控来自重点疫区的人群动态，在这种特殊时期有一定的合法性和必要性。
Yang Qingfeng, a professor at Fudan University, said the use of smart seals could effectively control the population dynamics from key epidemic areas and had a certain legitimacy and necessity in such a special period.
以智能封条为代表的物联网、大数据、人工智能等技术在疫情防控中得到使用，即通过无人化和自动化方式来确保其他人群（比如社区管理人员、同一楼栋的居民）的生命安全，也符合生命伦理中保护他人生命的原则。
The Internet of Things, Big Data and Artificial Intelligence, represented by the Smart Seal, are used in disease prevention and control to ensure the lives of other populations (such as community managers, residents of the same building) through dehumanization and automation, in line with the principles of bioethics that protect the lives of others.
在肯定智能封条作用的同时，闫宏秀和杨庆峰也从技术伦理的角度提出了一些建议。
While affirming the role of smart seals Yan Hongxiu and Yang Qingfeng also put forward some suggestions from the point of view of technical ethics.
“将收集数据的功能赋予智能封条，不是将责任让渡给技术，恰恰是更突显了人类的责任意识。
"Giving the ability to collect data to a smart seal, rather than ceding responsibility to technology, only accentuates the sense of human responsibility.
”闫宏秀说，智能封条的使用应该以居民的知情同意为基准原则，且只能收集疫情防控所必须的数据，不能滥用技术权限。
Yan Hongxiu said the use of smart seals should be based on the principle of informed consent, and should only collect data necessary for disease prevention and control.
其次，社区收集的数据只能用于疫情防控，不能被置于其余的场景，也不能被基于其他目的重新被挖掘使用。
Second, the data collected by the community can only be used for disease control and cannot be placed in the rest of the scenario, nor can it be re-exploited for other purposes.
杨庆峰则认为，智能封条当前的应用场景有独特性，需要预研灾后相关技术在其他场景下的伦理问题。
Yang Qingfeng thinks, smart seal current application scene has unique, need to prestudy the post-disaster related technology ethics question in other scene.
例如，如何区分诸如敏感人群、高危人群？如何制定相关场景的伦理选择标准？此外，特殊时期，使用智能封条的影响后果也需要得到研究。
For example, how to distinguish between sensitive populations and high-risk groups? How to develop ethical selection criteria for relevant scenarios? In addition, the consequences of using smart seals in particular periods of time need to be studied.
“被安装智能封条的住户居民好比被贴上了某种特殊标签，会成为特殊的关照对象，而这些人被技术管理的心理状态需要进一步研究。
"Households with smart seals are like people who have been given a special label that makes them special objects of care, and the psychological state of these people who are technically managed needs further research."
”他说。
'he said.
