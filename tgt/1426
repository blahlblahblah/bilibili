快递小哥、理发师、医护人员、患者……身处抗疫一线的每个“小人物”的相遇与重逢，都是一篇生动鲜活的故事。
Express brother, hairdresser, medical personnel, patients... in the first line of the fight against every "small people" meet and reunite, are a vivid story.
他们既平凡，又伟大，他们是历史长河中的沙砾，我们拾起来，放在阳光下也闪闪发光。
They are both ordinary and great. They are the gravel of history. We pick them up and they shine in the sun.
记者 | 吴　雪一个普通工作日的傍晚，采编群突然收到一条消息：“正在看你写的武汉快递小哥，里面的甘师傅竟然跟我搜集的一篇护士日记的内容对上了。
Reporter & # 124; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & nbsp; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45
”说话的是周刊资深编辑，她口中说的甘师傅，出现在了2月15日刊发《口述实录 | 快递小哥搞定金银潭医护难题：我送的不是快递，是救命的人啊！》一文的一张照片中。
It was the senior editor of a weekly magazine, what she says is Gump, who appeared in a photo on Feb. 15 of Oral English & # 160; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45
2月15日刊发的“快递小哥”一文中甘师傅正在为医护人员理发照片中的甘师傅以一张正在理发的照片出镜，手法娴熟，因为戴着口罩，看不清脸庞。
In the Feb. 15 issue of "Brother Express," Master Kane is showing medical staff a haircut photo of Master Kane in the mirror with a haircut, skilful because he is wearing a mask and cannot see his face clearly.
在“护士日记”中，对于甘师傅则有如下描述：“今天，有一手理发好手艺的甘师傅，放弃了休息时间，赶来宾馆为大家服务。
In the "Nurse Diary," for Gan Shifu described as follows: "Today, a good barber skills, Gan Shifu, gave up the rest time, came to the hotel to serve you.
”更巧合的是，在2月13日推送的《战“疫”急先锋驰援武汉，上海守得住吗？》一文中，甘师傅其实早已穿着蓝色防护服出镜。
Even more coincidentally, on February 13, the "plague" pioneer rushed to Wuhan, Shanghai can hold on to it? "In the article, Shifu Kan had already appeared in a blue suit.
甘师傅是谁，为何频频出现在护士、医生、志愿者的口中。
Who is Master Gan, why frequently appeared in the mouth of nurses, doctors, volunteers.
几番周折，我终于联系上了甘师傅。
After many twists and turns, I finally got in touch with Master Kane.
他手机的听筒还坏了，原来是这几天往返于各大医院义务理发，频繁用酒精消毒所致。
The handset of his mobile phone also broke down, it turned out to be a few days in major hospitals volunteer hairdressing, frequent use of alcohol disinfection.
白天，甘师傅要接待三四十个医护人员，根本腾不出时间来接受采访，前后约了三次，直到晚上8点他终于有了时间。
During the day, Master Kane had to take in thirty or forty paramedics. He had no time for interviews at all. He did not have time until 8pm.
别说，甘师傅留着一头个性卷发，经历也颇为传奇。
Don't say, Master Kane has a curly hair personality, the experience is quite legendary.
甘书爽是甘师傅的全名，一名地地道道的武汉人。
Gansu Shuang is the full name of Gan Shifu, a real Wuhan.
14岁那年，他成为了一名理发学徒；四年前，他在武汉市第一医院应聘上了救护车司机的工作，同时在医院附近开了一家理发店。
At the age of 14, he became an apprentice hairdresser; four years ago, he worked as an ambulance driver at Wuhan First Hospital and opened a barber shop near the hospital.
如今，他还有了另一个身份——理发志愿者。
Now, he has another status - a hairdresser volunteer.
1月31日，甘师傅在朋友圈偶然刷到一个招聘告示：“急招理发师，为驰援武汉的医护人员理发。
On January 31, Gan accidentally brushed a job posting in his circle of friends: "Hairdresser, to help Wuhan medical personnel haircut.
”落款招聘人正是快递小哥汪勇。
The undersigned is the courier Wang Yong.
甘师傅为女医生理发甘师傅告诉我，从1月22日开始，他就一直在武汉第一医院负责转运病人到8家定点收治医院，情况紧急时，一天能转运二十多个病患。
Since January 22, he has been in charge of transferring patients to eight designated hospitals in Wuhan No.1 Hospital. In case of emergency, he can transport more than 20 patients a day.
直到大年初一，开始做一休二。
Until the New Year's Day, began to take a break.
因为在转运过程中，甘师傅自己也穿过防护服，戴过帽子，知道头发长了特别不方便，还容易交叉感染。
Because in the transit process, Gansu himself also wear protective clothing, wearing a hat, know that hair is particularly inconvenient, but also easy to cross-infection.
甘师傅一直想利用“休二”的时间，做点实事。
Master Kane has been trying to take advantage of his "break two" time to do something practical.
“我一直没找到渠道，看到招聘信息，就主动报了名。
"I didn't find the source, saw the job posting, and volunteered my name.
”经过简单的对接询问，很快，甘师傅就被拉进了志愿者群，结识了汪勇和其他几位志愿者，当天就“开工”了。
"After a simple docking query, Gan was quickly drawn into the volunteer group, met Wang Yong and several other volunteers, and" started "the same day.
第一次剪发任务是去武汉市第三人民医院光谷院区，志愿者开车送甘师傅到达目的地，接待他的领队名叫翁超，是上海市杨浦区市东医院院感科科长，也是上海第二批援汉医疗队物资后勤保障组负责人。
The first haircut was to go to Guanggu courtyard of Wuhan Third People's Hospital. The volunteer drove Master Kan to his destination. He was received by his host, Weng Chao, head of the hospital sensuality section of Yangpu District Hospital in Shanghai.
甘师傅穿戴防护服出发前往医院理发“大年初四出发，很多人都是随便剪剪，找不到地方理发。
"Shifu Kane went to the hospital wearing protective clothing for a haircut." On Thursday, many people had their hair cut at random.
”翁超说这也是没办法的事情。
"Weng Chao said there was nothing he could do.
甘师傅已经来了三次了，一般都是早上9点准时到，一直干到晚上7点，甚至更晚。
Master Kane has been here three times, usually on time at 9: 00 in the morning and working until 7 p. m., or even later.
至于发型，男生剪板寸，女生剪短发，或者把头发扎起来，后脑勺以下推掉，方便打理。
As for hairstyles, boys cut inch, girls cut short hair, or tie up hair, the back of the head to push off, easy to take care of.
服务的范围包括武汉三院、金银潭医院、武汉第一医院等以及全国驰援武汉的医疗队。
The scope of services include Wuhan three hospitals, gold and silver pool hospital, Wuhan first hospital and other medical teams to help Wuhan.
在甘师傅看来，理发不仅仅只是理发，理发的过程是个放松的过程。
In Kane's view, hairdressing is more than a haircut. The process of hairdressing is a relaxing process.
因自己身处救治一线，特别理解医护人员所承受的救治压力，在剪刀“咔嚓咔嚓”声之间，和他们聊聊上海的生活、武汉的习俗甚至一些趣事，都能暂时松一松他们紧绷着的弦。
Because they are in the front line of treatment, special understanding of the pressure on medical personnel, scissors "click click" sound, and they talk about life in Shanghai, Wuhan customs and even some interesting things, can temporarily relax their tension strings.
经历了第一次“开工”之后，甘师傅不想再麻烦志愿者接送，一旦医院有理发的需求，就选择自己开车往返医院。
After the first "start," Gan did not want to bother volunteers with transport, once the hospital needs a haircut, choose to drive to and from the hospital.
甘师傅正在为医护人员理发剪完头发，甘师傅与医护人员合影2月16日，武汉气温骤降，下起了大雪。
Teacher Kan is cutting hair for medical staff, Gan Shifu and the medical staff took pictures Feb. 16, Wuhan temperature plummeted, a heavy snowfall.
甘师傅像往常一样到武汉三院出工，突然发现面包车电瓶没电了。
As usual, Master Kane went to Wuhan three hospitals to work, suddenly found that the van battery ran out of electricity.
封城，关门，现阶段根本无法找到修车的人和场所，甘师傅便一个人徒手推着面包车滑行了20米远，到达一个坡后，用滑行冲击力点燃了发动机。
At this stage it was impossible to find a mechanic or a place to repair the car. Master Kane glided 20 meters by himself, pushing the van with his bare hands, and when he reached a slope, he lit the engine with a sliding force.
早上9点，甘师傅准时出现在了武汉三院，翁超看到他时说：“哎，这么冷的天，还这么准时，谢谢你。
At 9 o'clock in the morning, Master Kan appeared on time at the three Wuhan hospitals. When Weng Chao saw him, he said, "Well, it's so cold, so punctual.
”翁超，虽然未在新闻中出现，但他的大多数需求却与汪勇有关。
Weng Chao, though not in the news, has most of his needs to do with Wang Yong.
作为武汉三院后勤保障组负责人，翁超负责医疗队所有人的生活物资、医疗物资采购。
As the head of the logistics support team of Wuhan Three Hospitals, Weng Chao is responsible for the purchase of medical supplies and supplies.
在“快递小哥”一文中，汪勇曾帮助上海医疗队买过一个生日蛋糕，而接收人正是翁超。
In the article "Express Brother," Wang Yong helped the Shanghai medical team buy a birthday cake, and the recipient was Weng Chao.
“当时我们刚来武汉没多久，人生地不熟，队员们日夜奋战，工作很辛苦，我就想为近期生日的队员们办一个小小的生日仪式，舒缓下他们的压力。
"It wasn't long before we came to Wuhan and I didn't know much about life. The players worked hard day and night and worked very hard.
”翁超说，他记得那个蛋糕很小6寸的，医护人员戴着口罩没办法吹蜡烛，拍照片的时候大家就摆了个吹蜡烛的样子，最后，蜡烛是大家用手扑灭的，“我想，这是我们所有人这辈子都难忘的回忆”。
"Weng Chao said he remembered that the cake was six inches small, that doctors and nurses were unable to blow candles while wearing masks, and that when photographs were taken, candles were put out by hand." I think it's an unforgettable memory for all of us, "he said.
上海医疗队员用手扑灭蜡烛翁超很感慨地说，印象深刻的另一件事也是汪勇帮忙的。
Shanghai medical team hand-extinguished candles Weng Chao very moved that the other impressive thing is Wang Yong to help.
当时从上海带的传统鞋套，太短，无法起到防护作用，必须快速找到长一点的鞋套才行，他求助了汪勇，对方很爽快地答应了，并在两天内送到翁超的手里。
At that time from Shanghai's traditional shoe cover, too short to play a protective role, had to find a longer shoe cover quickly, he asked Wang Yong, the other side very readily agreed, and within two days to Wengchao's hand.
翁超说：“我并不知道他是怎么买到的，后来看了文章，才知道原来，整个武汉市都断货了，汪勇是在一家距离市区55公里的鄂州葛店淘宝店，连夜拉回来了2000双。
"I don't know how he got it," Weng Chao said. He read the article and found out that the whole city of Wuhan had been out of stock.
真的觉得他特别不容易。
I really don't think he's that easy.
”快递小哥汪勇其实，像甘师傅这样多次出现在周刊推文中的人还有来自上海四院的张益辉医生和当时住院的病患詹新。
"Express brother Wang Yong in fact, such as Master Kan many times in the tweets also from Shanghai's fourth hospital Dr. Zhang Yi-hui and then hospital patient Zhan Xin.
在2月10日刊发的《口述实录|“只要我俩有一个活下去，5岁的女儿就不是孤儿”，我靠这个信念支撑到胜利》一文中，一张上海四院张益辉给武汉患者进行咽拭子采集的照片，与另一篇文章《被实名“举例”的最美逆行者》无缝衔接。
"As long as we have one to live, my five-year-old daughter is not an orphan," published on February 10, I relied on that belief to sustain victory. In a photo taken by Zhang Yi-hui, a Shanghai courtyard, swabbing patients with pharyngeal swabs, seamlessly linked to another article, "The Most Beautiful Convert by Real Name."
这张照片虽然只看到背影，但“大白医生”认真的动作，是那样的熟悉亲切。
Although this photo only sees the back, but "the doctor" earnest movement, is so familiar and kind.
张益辉与患者的合照在周刊两篇报道中无缝衔接口述采访对象是感染新冠肺炎的肖心诚夫妇，其妻子詹新正是照片中进行咽拭子检测的患者。
Zhang Yifui's photo with the patient was interviewed seamlessly in two weekly reports by Mr. and Mrs. Xiao Xincheng, whose wife, Zhan Xin, was the subject of a pharyngeal swab test.
大年初四，上海第四人民医院呼吸科主任张益辉带领15名医护人员组成援鄂医疗队对口支援武汉三院，詹新正是他们接手的首批病患。
On Thursday, Zhang Yifui, the respiratory director of the Fourth People's Hospital in Shanghai, led a team of 15 medical workers to support the three Wuhan hospitals.
据张益辉回忆，刚去的第一天，武汉三院收治的病人已经远超指定的350个床位，医护人员连夜奋战，几乎无休。
On the first day of the visit, Wuhan's three hospitals had admitted far more patients than the 350 beds designated, Zhang recalled, with medical staff battling almost overnight.
医疗队接岗后，他们才得以短暂休息。
It was only after the medical team took over that they were given a short rest.
作为17病区的老大，张益辉上任的第一件事就是把自己安排在了病区里最危险的岗位：为所有新冠患者进行核酸检测的咽拭子操作。
As the head of the 17-year-old, Zhang's first act was to put himself in the most dangerous position in the sick zone: swabbing all patients for nucleic acid testing.
詹新是39床的病人，来的时候，烧退了但有点咳嗽，心里还有些恐惧。
Zhan Xin is a 39-bed patient who came back with a burning cough and a little fear in his heart.
管床的同济大学附属康复医院主管护师沈艳梅俩人年龄相仿特别聊得来，沈护士常常安慰她：“你这个是轻症，放轻松，肯定没事的。
Shen Yanmei, head nurse at Tongji University's rehabilitation hospital, said, "You're a mild case. Relax. It's all right.
”而张益辉为了不增加病人负担，根据病症选择了药物治疗。
Zhang Yifui, however, chose to take medication according to his condition in order not to burden his patients.
护师们也会建一个“医患交流群”，即便不在岗位，也能24小时解答患者的顾虑和疑问。
Nursing staff also create a "doctor-patient community" that answers patients' concerns and questions 24 hours a day, even when not on the job.
2月7日，詹新退烧三天，核酸检测两次阴性，痊愈出院。
Feb. 7, Zhan Xin three days of fever, nucleic acid testing twice negative, recovered from the hospital.
詹新与同济大学附属康复医院主管护师沈艳梅合影出院当天，武汉三院为7名首批痊愈的患者搞了一个小型仪式，詹新兴奋地手舞足蹈，她拿起手机和沈艳梅拍下了这张合照，并笑着说：“等到春暖花开来武汉，请你们吃武汉鸭脖子啊。
On the day of her discharge from the hospital, the three Wuhan hospitals held a small ceremony for seven of the first recovered patients. She danced and clapped her cell phone and Shen Yanmei. She smiled and said, "When the flowers come to Wuhan, please eat the duck's neck in Wuhan
”根据目前“应收尽收”的原则，张益辉所在的病区收治了58个病人，远超指定床位35个，“该加的床都加满了，但好在大家心态都很好”。
Zhang's ward has treated 58 patients, far more than the 35 designated beds, according to the current principle of "all-receivable," adding that "the beds are full, but everyone is in a good mood."
