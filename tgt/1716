总体而言，港人对待疫情，后来就没有内地那么紧张了。
Overall, Hong Kong people have been less nervous about the epidemic than in the Mainland.
我妈妈讲，她觉得作为一个香港居民，自己最大的感受是彷徨。
My mother told me that as a Hong Kong resident, she felt the greatest loss.
她抱怨道，在香港，没工开等于没饭吃了；公司起先通知放假到24号，何时复工再议，而现在仍然是等通知的状态。
'In Hong Kong, 'she complains,' no work means no more food. 'The company was initially notified of the holiday until the 24th, when to resume work, and is still waiting for notification.
口述 | 岑雅茵整理 | 孔冰欣岑雅茵，香港居民，深圳大学新闻传播学院新闻系本科三年级学生2月初的时候，香港的“疯狂”程度或甚于内地于我而言，这场疫情，比较“慢热”。
At the beginning of February, at the beginning of February, Hong Kong's "mad" level was either greater than that of the mainland at the beginning of February, at least at least as much as I did. The epidemic was "slow and hot."
我是深圳大学传播学院新闻系的一名大三学生，祖籍广东江门开平，现在已成了香港居民。
I am a junior student in the Department of Journalism of Shenzhen University. I am now a resident of Hong Kong.
记得2019年12月29日，我从学校返港；2020年1月12日，又从香港回到江门。
I remember returning to Hong Kong from school on 29 December 2019 and from Hong Kong to Jiangmen on 12 January 2020.
此后至今，我便一直“滞留”老家开平。
Since then, I have been "stuck" in my hometown of Kaiping.
春节前在香港的那段时间，我继续做我的兼职工作。
During my stay in Hong Kong before Spring Festival, I continued to work part-time.
当时，我只从新闻、微博上简单了解到武汉出现了新冠肺炎的消息，且微信朋友圈里也没所谓“大疫来袭”的氛围体验，因此并不十分在意病毒可能会带来如何严重的影响，反而觉得，相隔有些距离，应该是没大问题的。
At that time, I only from the news, micro-blog to understand that Wuhan appeared the news of the New Crown Pneumonia, and Weixin friends do not have the so-called "epidemic" atmosphere experience, so do not care about the possible serious impact of the virus, on the contrary, feel that some distance should not be a major problem.
而在我做兼职的公司里，偶尔听到同事们有讨论，大抵也就说说希望疫情不要继续扩散、不要蔓延到香港，都认为没什么需要特别担心的。
At my part-time company, I occasionally hear discussions among my colleagues, and I generally say I hope the epidemic does not spread or spread to Hong Kong. I think there is nothing to worry about.
那时候的香港，至少从新闻报道上看，还没有新冠肺炎的病例，所以我回开平前，同事们心情尚比较放松，还半开玩笑地提醒我，“小心点，别把病毒带回来”。
In Hong Kong, at least in the news, there had been no new cases of pneumonia, so before I returned to Kaiping, my colleagues were relaxed and half jokingly reminded me, "Be careful not to bring the virus back."
当疫情逐渐蔓延至广东省时，开平的人们起初依旧不以为意，据我观察，街上戴口罩者仍为少数。
When the epidemic spread to Guangdong province, people in Kaiping were still not impressed at first, and I observed that the number of people wearing masks on the streets was still small.
我的许多同学则在朋友圈吐槽，他们劝告家里长辈出门要戴口罩，偏偏长辈认为这是小题大做，何必如此忧虑呢？好在，我家人理性，倒是听劝的。
Many of my classmates are spitting in a circle of friends. They advise their elders to wear masks when they go out, but they think this is a fussy situation.
直到江门出现了第一例病例，口罩、消毒液、洗手液等脱销了，开平的人们才“后知后觉”，如临大敌起来。
Until the emergence of the first case of Jiangmen, masks, disinfectant, hand sanitizer, and other out of stock, Kaiping people "after the knowledge," such as the enemy.
2月初，开平出现了第一例。
In early February, the first case occurred in Kaiping.
这个时候，已经很难买到大量的口罩、消毒用品。
At this time, it is difficult to buy a large number of masks, disinfectant supplies.
走在街上，我体会到了一种压抑之感——人来人往，几乎没有不戴口罩的。
Walking down the street, I sensed a sense of depression - people coming and going, almost without a mask.
各大药店网上预约口罩，甚至到了“抢”的地步，比粉丝争夺爱豆演唱会的门票还夸张。
Major drugstores online booking masks, even to the point of "grab" than fans competing for tickets for the concert is exaggerated.
开平这第一例，更造成我朋友圈的刷屏，全部都是关于这例病人的各路消息和相关活动路径，态度清一色痛心疾首——开平这一方不易的“净土”，竟也被“污染”了！与此同时，据我在港的亲友反映，2月初，香港的“疯狂”程度或甚于内地，为了买口罩，排队的人群足足蜿蜒好几条街——唉，以前是蒙上面罩抢钱，如今是揣上钱包抢口罩了……尽管香港官方称物资不缺，但是在大大小小的商场、超市里，别说口罩了，凡是带有“消毒”字眼的商品都买不到，粮食、方便面、纸巾、油盐甚至卫生巾都完全被抢购一空。
The first case of Kaiping resulted in a scrubbing screen in my circle of friends, all about the patient's news and related routes of activity, all in a state of complete desolation - and, according to my friends and relatives in Hong Kong, they were unable to buy masks in large and small shops and supermarkets.
像我妈妈一大早就起来去买大米，无果，家里惟余存货，众人苦不堪言。
Like my mother rose early in the morning to buy rice, fruitless, the family surplus stock, people suffering unspeakable.
我家在观塘区，据我爸爸说，像观塘这类香港比较老旧的区域，月初市民哄抢的情况较为普遍。
My family is in Kwun Tong District. According to my father, in older areas like Kwun Tong, looting by the public was common in early months.
他跑到九龙湾的淘大商场去转了转，发现那边就没有哄抢、相对“平静”。
He ran to the Taobao Mall in Kowloon Bay and found that there was no looting, relative "calm."
而令我奇怪的是，菜市场里、私人店家里的粮油、纸巾等物资，不知何故乏人问津。
And to my surprise, in the Halles market, private stores home grain and oil, paper towels, and other materials, I do not know why no one.
当然，随着疫情渐渐得到控制，观塘区现在的物资供应，已能满足百姓需求，只是口罩依然紧俏。
Of course, as the epidemic gets under control, supplies in Kwun Tong now meet the needs of the population, although masks are still in short supply.
总体而言，港人对待疫情，后来就没有内地那么紧张了。
Overall, Hong Kong people have been less nervous about the epidemic than in the Mainland.
街上虽有90%的人都戴着口罩，但照样出门，不至于像内地，闭门不出。
Although 90% of the street people wear masks, but still out of the door, not like the mainland, the door closed.
Play岑爸爸拍了一段观塘某站点后面大街的短视频。
Playzen's father took a short video of the street behind a Kwun Tong site.
他在视频里用开平话说的是：这里是开源道，依旧人来人往岑爸爸在观塘的家附近拍的照片附近的菜市场百佳超市。
What he said in Kaiping in the video was: "This is Open Source Road, and it's still open source," at the Hallmark supermarket near his father's home in Kwun Tong.
从照片上看，物资供应，能满足当地百姓需求不过，影响肯定是有的。
From the photos, the supply of materials, can meet the needs of the local population, but the impact is certainly there.
我妈妈讲，她觉得作为一个香港居民，自己最大的感受是彷徨。
My mother told me that as a Hong Kong resident, she felt the greatest loss.
她抱怨道，在香港，没工开等于没饭吃了；公司起先通知放假到24号，何时复工再议，而现在仍然是等通知的状态。
'In Hong Kong, 'she complains,' no work means no more food. 'The company was initially notified of the holiday until the 24th, when to resume work, and is still waiting for notification.
延缓开工的确能减少人与人的接触，避免传染加剧，可是一些生意差的小公司，已经面临几近倒闭的危机。
It is true that a delay in starting work would reduce people-to-people contact and avoid further contagion, but some small companies with poor business are already in danger of going out of business.
去年暴徒作乱之时，我就听妈妈说，她公司的一些分店生意惨淡，现疫情“雪上加霜”，若生意再无起色，那些分店关门大吉亦不无可能。
Last year, when the mob was in turmoil, I heard from my mother that some of her company's stores were in bad shape, adding to the current epidemic, and that if business did not pick up again, it would be possible for the stores to close.
我们学校定在3月9日起开网课，预计4月正式入学。
Our school is due to open on March 9th and is expected to start in April.
但是，学校也有说要做好延长线上教学的准备。
But schools also say they are ready to teach on the extension line.
我爸妈觉得，开平也许比香港更加安全，因此不急着催我返还。
My parents thought Kaiping might be safer than Hong Kong, so they didn't have to hurry me back.
毕竟，香港人流多且杂，你不知道下一秒从你身边走过的是哪里人，危险系数或更大。
After all, Hong Kong is crowded and crowded, you don't know the next second from your side where the people, the risk factor or more.
何况，在香港的家里还没装WiFi，不利于上网课。
What's more, you don't have WiFi in your home in Hong Kong, which isn't conducive to online classes.
此外，港班车客运全市暂停，搭乘高铁亦有点担心，客运交通上也存在诸多不便。
In addition, the Hong Kong shuttle bus service was suspended, high-speed rail is also a bit worried, passenger traffic there are many inconveniences.
现在我还没有找到对香港的“归属感”我的外公外婆住在香港，妈妈具备申请移居的资质。
Now I have not found a "sense of belonging" to Hong Kong My grandparents live in Hong Kong and my mother is qualified to apply for immigration.
我读初中之前，妈妈获得了香港居民的身份，此后，因为超龄子女赴港定居的政策，她开始着手操办爸爸、我、弟弟的移居事宜。
Before I went to junior high school, my mother acquired the status of a Hong Kong resident, and since then, because of the policy of settling her over-age children in Hong Kong, she has started to handle the migration of my father, me and my younger brother.
我一直在开平生活，到2017年2月，我们三人的移居申请也有了结果，于是就全家搬到香港了。
I had been living in Kaiping until February 2017, when my family moved to Hong Kong.
实际上，在开平当地，不少家庭都是这样子搬到香港去的。
In fact, many families in Kaiping have moved to Hong Kong in this way.
开平民风淳朴，侨乡风情，令我拥有一种自豪感。
Open the simple style of the common people, overseas customs, so that I have a sense of pride.
目前，爷爷奶奶依旧驻守开平，每年春节，我们一家都会回到开平过年。
At present, grandparents are still stationed in Kaiping, every Spring Festival, our family will return to Kaiping New Year.
我觉得，内地这边“年味”更足，每至除夕，家人买好花、年桔、春联等，屋内布置一新；而我们在香港的房子，因为空间有限，所以这些东西、这套流程，也就不弄了。
I think, inland side of the "annuals" more adequate, every New Year's Eve, the family bought good flowers, orange, spring couplets, and so on, the house in Hong Kong, because the space limited, so these things, this process, will not be.
一转眼，移居香港已经三年多。
After a while, we moved to Hong Kong for over three years.
在港生活，除了居住空间小了些，其它方面还蛮不错。
Living in Hong Kong, apart from the smaller living space, is quite good in other respects.
然而，我还没有找到对香港的“归属感”，毕竟，我在内地长大，赴港时日短，和当地社会接触不多。
However, I have not yet found a "sense of belonging" to Hong Kong. After all, I grew up in the Mainland, spent a short time in Hong Kong and had little contact with the local community.
据说，疫情未散，眼下香港仍有游行示威的、暴动的，“港独”并没消停。
It is said that the epidemic is still unfolding, that there are still demonstrations and riots in Hong Kong, and that "Hong Kong independence" has not stopped.
我弟弟原来的班级里，也有“港独”倾向的人，显得排斥移民，不过，最近这一年以来，他换了班级，觉得风气有所改善。
My brother's old class, too, was prone to "Hong Kong independence," which seemed to marginalize immigrants, but in the past year he had changed classes and felt the atmosphere had improved.
其实，并非所有香港居民都是暴徒，希望内地的朋友，不要误解。
In fact, not all Hong Kong residents are thugs, I hope mainland friends, do not misunderstand.
因我人在开平，所以最后想继续接着说说开平的景况。
Because I am in Kaiping, so finally I want to continue to talk about Kaiping situation.
出现首例病例后不久，全市客运站的港班车客运就完全停运了。
Shortly after the first case, the city's passenger terminal bus service was completely shut down.
2月4日到9日，“开平市肺炎疫情防控指挥部”发布了全市范围内所有餐饮服务行业暂停营业的通知。
February 4 to 9, "Kaiping City Pneumonia Prevention and Control Command" issued a city-wide notice of suspension of all catering services.
2月8日开始，从江门地区以外返回开平的本地居民或外来人员，都要在1小时内主动向居住地所属居委会或自行上网进行报告登记。
Starting on February 8, local residents or foreigners returning to Kaiping from outside the Jiangmen area will report to their local residents' local residents or to the Internet within one hour on their own initiative.
11日开始，各大药店加大了口罩的供应，可依然需要先在网上预约才能前往线下门店购买。
Starting on the 11th, major pharmacies increased the supply of masks, but still need to make an online appointment to go to the store to buy.
那几天，开平的朋友们在朋友圈疯转口罩的相关信息。
On those days, friends in Kaiping were frantically switching masks in a circle of friends.
疫情期间，开平的商场也是有营业的。
During the epidemic, Kaiping shopping malls were also open.
据我了解，开平一些旧城区并没有采取“购买物资限制出入人数”的做法，但有一些区域（如长沙街道办）就规定上班需要通行证，且每户两天仅限一人外出，大大小小的住宅区都规定非该住宅区内的住户、汽车等都禁止入内。
As far as I know, Kaiping has not adopted the practice of "purchasing goods to limit the number of people entering or leaving the city," but some areas (such as Changsha Street Office) require a permit to work and are restricted to one person per two days.
开平的家附近一览从居民的角度，这样的做法不能说对日常生活全无干扰。
From the point of view of the residents of Kaiping's home, this practice cannot be said to interfere with daily life.
以细节为例：每个人购买物资实受限制，如果这时家中能多出一人助力，即可多买一份。
Take the details: each person is really limited in the purchase of goods, if the family can help more than one person can buy one more.
其次，工作也是一个问题，没有复工，就意味着没有收入、在家空等，对一些经济条件较为困难的家庭真是不小的打击。
Second, work is also a problem, and failure to return to work means that there is no income, no home, etc., which is not a small blow to some families with more difficult economic conditions.
目前，开平唯一病例业已治愈，一些餐饮服务行业慢慢恢复营业了，但多数还是以外卖为主。
Kaiping is now the only case that has been cured, some catering services have slowly resumed business, but most are mainly take-out sales.
按我之前外出采买之见闻，街上行人多起来了，口罩虽仍需网上预约，但货源充足，你手速快些，总能买到。
According to my previous experience with shopping, the streets have become more pedestrian, although still need to make an online appointment, but sufficient resources, you can always buy faster.
对于老人，则提供电话预约，这点考虑得还是比较人性化的。
For the elderly, the provision of telephone appointments, this consideration is more humane.
我独自一人宅在家里，主要的娱乐方式就是煲剧、看电影、听听音乐、玩游戏、看书，增进厨艺等。
I live alone at home. The main forms of entertainment are making great movies, watching movies, listening to music, playing games, reading books and improving cooking skills.
因为不和爷爷奶奶住在一起，须“自力更生”，所以这段时间我的厨艺突飞猛进——当然，爷爷也会时不时地，给我带些肉类、蔬菜过来。
Since I didn't live with my grandparents and had to be "self-reliant," my cooking prospered during this time--and, of course, Grandpa would bring me meat and vegetables every now and then.
大门不出，自给自足各地的救助捐款让我倍受触动。
The door was closed, and I was touched by donations from self-sufficient communities.
下图就是我在家里阳台上往下拍的照片，我家楼下是街道卫生办，这天我恰好看到了网络捐献的公益活动在进行拍照认证。
Below is a picture of me on the balcony of my home, my downstairs is the street health office, I happened to see the network donation of public welfare activities in the photo certification.
不仅如此，很多国外的开平华侨，积极捐献物资给江门。
Not only that, many overseas Kaiping overseas Chinese, actively donated materials to Jiangmen.
另外，我很感谢各小区体温测量点物业人员的付出，对我们居民来说，只是停留几秒钟，而他们却是长时间不分昼夜地守在一块地方，辛苦。
In addition, I am grateful for the efforts of the property owners of temperature measurement points, for our residents, only a few seconds, but they are long day and night in the same place, hard.
作为一个追星女孩（追星女孩不一定混饭圈，但饭圈的风风雨雨我也是一路见证的），我在微博看到，此次饭圈女孩尽自己的绵薄之力救助疫区，比如“鹿晗吧_LuhanBar”已经联合捐赠了十五批物资，好！你首先是个中国人，然后才是饭圈女孩；用最炽热的心去追星，也用最热血的心去做公益。
As a starstruck girl (I don't necessarily mix with starry girls, but I've seen the ups and downs of the rice circle), I saw on Weibo that this time around she had donated 15 batches of material, such as Whitherhan _ Luhan Bar.
公益面前无饭圈，平时追星的女孩们，在大是大非上绝不含糊。
There is no rice ring in front of the public welfare, usually chasing stars girls, in the big is not ambiguous.
我认为粉丝圈也该成为传递正能量的地方，不管是谁的粉丝，不管以往是否互撕过，如今都有一个共同的偶像，都有一个共同的愿望：阿中哥哥加油！大家都要平平安安地度过这轮疫情！（图片由受访者提供）征集令《新民周刊》现面向全国征集新冠肺炎采访对象和真实故事：如果你是参与抗击新冠肺炎疫情的医护人员或其家属，我们希望聆听你的“战疫”故事，也希望传达你的诉求。
