是日一早，闫云霞重新回到前几日战斗的车间，她是日照三奇医疗卫生用品有限公司（简称：三奇医保）车间组组长，三奇医保仅国内工厂的口罩日产能即达到150万支，在山东乃至中国、甚至全球口罩行业均名次靠前。
Yan Yunxia is back to the workshop of the previous days battle, she is the Rizhao Sanqi Medical Sanqi Medical Products Co. Ltd. (Sanzihealthcare) workshop group, Sanqi Medical Mask production capacity of domestic factories alone up to 1.5 million, in Shandong and even China, even the global mask industry ranked high.
闫云霞的表弟、表弟妹、表姐都回到车间。
Yan Yunxia's cousin, cousin, cousin back to the workshop.
一起进入车间加班的还有她22岁的儿子，个子很高，是山东大学齐鲁医院的实习生。
Also working overtime at the workshop was her 22-year-old son, a tall intern at Qilu Hospital in Shandong University.
儿子听闫云霞说所处工厂缺人，自愿成为100多名临工中的一员。
Yan Yan Xia son said that the factory where the lack of people, volunteered to become one of more than 100 temporary workers.
新型肺炎突如其来，随着国内多地要求民众在公共场合必须佩戴口罩，以及湖北多家医院连续发出医疗防护物资的求援公告，对医疗防护用品的需求渐趋高潮。
The new type of pneumonia comes all of a sudden, with people being required to wear masks in public places in many parts of the country, and Hubei hospitals have issued successive medical protection notices, the demand for medical protection supplies gradually climax.
截至大年初一，三奇医保已发往武汉240万套口罩，7万余套防护服、2.8万个防护面罩。
By the first day of New Year, Sanqi Medical Insurance had sent 2.4 million sets of masks, 70,000 suits and 28,000 face masks to Wuhan.
不仅三奇医保刷新着自己的生产纪录，距离日照200余公里外的蓝帆医疗股份有限公司（简称：蓝帆医疗）同样在和时间赛跑，这是全球规模最大的一次性PVC手套生产企业、也是中低值耗材和高值耗材完整布局的医疗器械龙头企业。
Not only is Sanqi Healthcare updating its own production record, but BlueSail Medical Inc. is also racing against time, the world's largest single-use PVC glove maker and a leader in the complete distribution of low- and medium-value consumables and high-value consumables.
他们捐赠了防护产品组合中防护能力最强、针孔率最低（AQL 1.5以上）的医疗级防护手套100万支，已于1月24日从淄博发出，不日抵鄂。
They donated 1 million medical-grade protective gloves with the strongest protection and the lowest pinhole ratio (AQL 1.5 and above) of the protective product mix, which was issued in Zibo on 24 January.
在这个春节，三奇医保和蓝帆医疗都进入紧急“战时状态”，克服了用工、原料、物流等一系列困难，与产业链上的兄弟“抱团”，供暖予武汉。
During the Spring Festival, Sanqi Medical Insurance and Blue Sail Medical Service both entered an emergency "wartime state," overcame a series of difficulties such as labor, raw materials and logistics, and joined hands with brothers in the industrial chain to provide heat to Wuhan.
离职员工回厂帮工山东省淄博市临淄区069乡道的蓝帆医疗产业园制造部内一生产车间，宗鹏搓了搓手、揉了揉发红的眼睛，使劲地盯着飞速转动的陶瓷手模。
Jung Peng rubbed his hands, rubbed his red eyes and stared at the swiftly turning ceramic hand mould at a production workshop in the blue-sails medical industrial park of 069 Township Road, Linzibo, Shandong Province.
正在蓝帆医疗车间赶工的宗鹏“事关医疗防护，丝毫不能马虎。
Zong Peng, who is working in the Blue Sailing Medical Workshop, "is concerned with medical protection.
”他说。
'he said.
说这话时，宗鹏口袋里的手机，屏幕闪烁，那是来自亲朋好友的新春问候，包括妻子和两个孩子的声音。
When Zong Peng said this, the cell phone in his pocket, the screen flashing, it is from relatives and friends of the New Year greeting, including his wife and two children's voices.
往年此刻，他可以享受春节7天假期（注：一般是腊月二十九至正月初五）以及儿女绕膝的欢乐，逐一回复亲友问候。
At this time of year, he can enjoy the 7-day holiday of Spring Festival and the joy of his children around his knees.
今年初一，他一整天几乎都没时间看手机。
At the beginning of this year, he hardly had time to read his cell phone all day.
在“为疫情不停工不停产全力以赴”红纸黑字标语的号召下，眼前这片满负荷运转、8条生产线充斥的生产车间是宗鹏和其团队加班的地方，24小时三班倒“连轴转”。
Under the call of red-paper slogans, Zong Peng and his team are working overtime in a 24-hour three-shift operation at a time when Zong and his team are working full-time and eight production lines.
以宗鹏所处的一分厂为例，日产能为680万支，即便如此，也要加班加点备货。
Take one of Zongpeng's branches, which has a capacity of 6.8 million units a day, and even then has to work overtime to stock up.
“这是一场战斗，对象是疫情。
"It's a battle, it's an epidemic.
”宗鹏说。
"said Zong Peng.
山东省日照市高新区河山镇三奇医保厂区内，“战斗”也在进行。
"Fighting" is also taking place in Sanqi Medical Treatment Plant, a high-tech district of Rizhao, Shandong Province.
初一一早，闫云霞重新回到前几日战斗的车间，她是这个车间的组长，带着表弟、表弟妹、表姐和临时加入车间的儿子一起赶工。
Early the first day, Yan Yunxia back to the previous days of the workshop, she is the workshop leader, with her cousin, cousin, cousin and temporary join the workshop son to work together.
三奇医保车间中的闫云霞等人三奇医保一些离职员工选择“回归”，许静是其中的一个。
Yan Yunxia Yan health care workshop in the three people Sanqi Medical Insurance some employees choose to "return" Xu Jing is one of them.
她技术熟练，与不少离职的老员工一起，出现在生产车间里，利用春节假期到老单位加班。
She is skilled, with a number of former employees, appeared in the production workshops, using the Spring Festival holiday to work overtime in the old unit.
“家是小家，工厂是大家，我们一起努力，为了国家。
"Home is a small family, factory is everyone, we work together, for the country.
”疫情袭来，防控为重。
Prevention and control come first.
在三奇医保，随着“闫云霞”等人的回归，再加上紧急调集的100多名临时员工，他们的医用外科防护口罩、医用防护口罩和医用一次性防护服等各项生产记录不断被刷新。
In Sanqi Medical Care, with the return of "Yan Yunxia" and others, coupled with the emergency mobilization of more than 100 temporary staff, their medical surgical masks, medical masks and medical disposable protective clothing production records are constantly updated.
类似的场景也在蓝帆医疗发生。
Similar scenes occur in BlueSail Medical.
宗鹏透露，目前包括一分厂在内所有生产医疗防护用品的车间目前均满负荷运转，即便是刚刚过去的这个除夕之夜，他和不少同事也一同在厂里度过，“公司的后勤给准备了饺子。
At present, all the factories that produce medical protection products, including a branch factory, are running at full capacity. Even on the New Year's Eve just past, he and many of his colleagues are spending time at the factory.
”至少在剩余的春节假期内，这种“战时状态”还将持续。
At least for the rest of the Spring Festival, this "wartime state" will continue.
与闫云霞和宗鹏在厂区并肩作战的，还包括日照和淄博领导班子的一把手。
Yan Yun Xia and Zong Peng in the factory side by side, but also includes the sun and Zibo leadership team leader.
“目前，我们的生产计划已排到了3月底。
"Right now, our production schedule is through the end of March.
”宗鹏说。
"said Zong Peng.
“不惜一切代价完成任务”忙碌的不仅是宗鹏、闫云霞等一线员工，王常申是三奇医保董事长，前些天刚从越南分厂赶回来，春节在日照工厂全力督战。
"At all costs to complete the task" busy is not only Zong Peng, Yan Yunxia and other frontline staff, Wang Changshen is Sanqi Medical Board Chairman, just a few days ago from the Vietnamese branch of the factory back, the Spring Festival in the Rizhao factory full supervision.
他的手机响个不停，“打爆”已是常态，“这几天，基本上每天都要充三四次电。
His cell phone kept ringing and "popping" was the norm, "basically three or four times a day these days."
”三奇医保成立于1993年，注册资本1000万元，为全球排名靠前的医用口罩、医用防护服生产企业，并在越南等地设有工厂，其产品涵盖医疗器械、医用卫生护理、个人健康保洁、专业安全防护和无纺布家居用品等多个领域，产品95%远销日本、美国、欧盟及东南亚30多个国家和地区。
Founded in 1993 with a registered capital of 10 million yuan, Sanqi Medical Care is the world's leading manufacturer of medical masks and protective clothing, with factories in places such as Vietnam. Its products cover medical devices, medical health care, personal hygiene, professional safety protection and nonwoven household goods, with 95% exported to Japan, the United States, the EU and more than 30 countries and regions in Southeast Asia.
在正常情况下，三奇医保日照工厂的口罩日产能是150万支，在疫情蔓延的当前，产品仍是供不应求，一度还面临用工难的压力。
With a capacity of 1.5 million masks a day under normal circumstances, Sanqi Medical Sun Pictures is still in short supply at a time when the epidemic is spreading, and is under pressure to use jobs.
问题没有办法多。
There is no way out.
日照高新区河山镇镇党委副书记甄华伟介绍，为确保重点防疫物资供应，他们已经发动了返乡大学生、原企业离职人员，并抽调附近两家针织厂员工等700多人前来“应战”，“通过体检、培训后，他们将成为新的生力军。
To ensure the supply of key epidemic prevention materials, Zhen Huawei, deputy secretary of the township Party committee of Rizhao Hi-tech District, said more than 700 people, including 700 from two nearby knitwear factories, had been mobilized to ensure the supply of key epidemic prevention materials.
”经工业和信息化部消费品工业司研究与企业协商，自2020年1月23日-2月10日，三奇医保每日提供100万只外科医护口罩（合计2000万只）、5万只防护口罩（合计100万只）、0.5万套医用一次性防护服（合计10万套）。
From January 23 to February 10, 2020, Sanctuary provided 1 million surgical masks (a total of 20 million), 50,000 protective masks (a total of 1 million), and 55,000 medical disposable suits (totalling 100,000), in consultation with enterprises by the Consumer Industries Department of the Ministry of Industry and Informatization.
王常申表态：“不惜一切代价完成（任务）。
"Do it at all costs," he said.
”蓝帆医疗董事长刘文静有类似表态，“这是举国大事，是生命的事，也是我们应该有也必须有的担当和责任……我们尽最大的力量去做好该做的事情。
"It's a national event, it's a matter of life, and it's a responsibility we should have and must have... We do our best to do what we have to do," said Liu Wenjing, chairman of BlueSail Medical.
”她于2002年12月创办蓝帆医疗（股票代码002382），注册地位于山东省淄博市，目前是全球规模最大的一次性PVC手套生产企业、也是中低值耗材和高值耗材完整布局的医疗器械龙头企业。
She started BlueSail Medical (stock code 002382) in December 2002, registered in Zibo, Shandong Province, and is now the world's largest single-use producer of PVC gloves and a leader in the complete distribution of low and medium-value consumables and high-value consumables.
以中低值耗材板块为例，其主要产品为医疗手套、健康防护手套、急救包、医用敷料等为主的医疗防护产品线，主打产品PVC手套的全球市场份额22%。
As an example, the main products are medical gloves, health protection gloves, first aid kits, medical dressings and so on. The global market share of PVC gloves is 22%.
2019年，蓝帆医疗一次性PVC手套生产量为180亿支。
In 2019, BlueSail produced 18 billion disposable PVC gloves.
在湖北等地面临医疗防护用品巨大缺口的当前，刘文静带着蓝帆医疗一众高管，成立蓝帆医疗重大疫情应急响应指挥工作小组。
At a time when Hubei and other places are facing huge gaps in medical supplies, Liu Wenjing has set up a blue-sails medical emergency response command team with a team of senior managers.
“目前，我们这个小组全体成员24小时在线，3个制造部组成的生产组加班加点地生产，客户组、物流组、后勤组等全力配合。
"At present, all members of our team are on-line 24 hours a day, the production team of three manufacturing departments is working overtime, and the customer team, logistics team, logistics team and so on are fully cooperative.
”蓝帆医疗后勤保障部成员宗秋月表示。
"Blue Sail Medical Logistics Department members live on the autumn moon.
有此支撑，这家健康防护领域的领军企业自发向武汉新型肺炎防控指挥部无偿捐赠旗下防护产品组合中防护能力最强、针孔率最低（AQL 1.5以上）的医疗级防护手套100万支。
With this support, the leading health-protection company spontaneously donated 1 million medical-grade protective gloves with the strongest protection and the lowest needle-hole ratio (AQL 1.5 and above) to the Wuhan New Pneumonia Prevention and Control Command.
“在保护好自己和家人的情况下，尽我们最大的力量做该做的事。
"When we protect ourselves and our families, we do what we have to do to the best of our ability.
”刘文静说，上述物资将捐赠给湖北地区，“在春节期间，我们还将根据产能和货源情况继续捐赠消毒液、酒精喷雾等系列防护产品。
"During the Spring Festival, we will continue to donate a range of protective products, including disinfectant and alcohol spray, depending on the production capacity and supply," Liu said.
”蓝帆医疗重大疫情应急响应指挥工作小组微信截图1月24日除夕夜，三奇医保灯火通明，继23日11万件防护口罩踏上发往武汉的顺丰快车后，又一批防护服连夜发出。
2007-9-25 21: 48 Sanqi Medical Emergency Response Command Task Force A new batch of protective clothing was issued overnight after 110,000 protective masks set off for Wuhan on January 24.
此前曾有三架飞机停在日照机场，计划运送这批物资，后来因故改由顺丰速运承运，这期间是由日照市主要领导居间协调物流资源。
Three planes had previously stopped at Rizhao airport to deliver the cargo, but were later moved to Shunfeng Express, with Rizhao leading the way to coordinate logistics resources.
截至大年初一，三奇医保已经发往武汉240万套口罩，7万余套防护服、2.8万个防护面罩。
By the first day of New Year, Sanqi Medical Insurance had sent 2.4 million sets of masks, 70,000 suits and 28,000 face masks to Wuhan.
产业链当平价保供由于上述两大企业此前均做外销订单，且不少外销订单生产日期早已排定。
Industrial chain when affordable guaranteed supply because the two above-mentioned two enterprises have done export orders, and many export production order production date has been scheduled.
面对不断蔓延的疫情，为供应国内市场，这两家企业负责人均表示，优先保证国内订单，加班加点先满足国内需求。
In the face of a spreading epidemic and to supply the domestic market, both executives said they gave priority to securing domestic orders and working overtime to meet domestic demand.
以蓝帆医疗为例，为确保在除夕能够及时把100万支手套发至武汉，自1月23号晚间始，该公司在原有基础上又从自动生产系统中切出一条用作疫情防护手套生产专线。
To ensure that one million gloves can be delivered to Wuhan on New Year's Eve, for example, the company began cutting an epidemic prevention glove production line from the automated production system on the night of January 23.
据悉，这一条生产线每日产能达85万支，都是防护等级最高的AQL1.5产品。
It is reported that the production line of 850,000 units per day, are the highest level of protection of AQL1.5 products.
蓝帆医疗、三奇医保不是孤本。
BlueSail and Sanqi Medicare are not alone.
以口罩为例，身为世界最大的口罩生产国，中国这条产业链上的企业日最大产能共计2000多万只。
Take masks. As the world's largest producer of masks, China has a total capacity of more than 20 million a day.
来自行业的最新调查数据显示，截至目前，国内已有30多家企业复产，产能恢复至平日的40%以上，产量达到800万只/日以上。
According to the latest survey data from the industry, more than 30 enterprises have resumed production so far, with capacity restored to more than 40 per cent of normal capacity and production of more than 8 million person-days.
尽管三奇医保这些企业负责人表示，对保障市场供应有底气、有信心，但截至目前，随着国内30个省级辖区相继启动重大突发公共卫生事件一级响应，口罩等医疗防护用品面对巨大缺口仍是不争事实。
Although the heads of these companies say they are confident and confident about safeguarding the market's supply, so far the huge gap in medical supplies such as masks has been undisputed, with 30 provincial jurisdictions starting major public health emergency first-level responses.
以京东为例，这家电商对外公布的信息则显示，1月19日至22日，京东累计售出1.26亿只口罩，仅1月22日一天，口罩销量环比上月日均增幅高达48倍。
From January 19 to 22, Kyung-tung sold 126 million face masks, and on January 22 alone, sales rose 48-fold from a month earlier, according to information released by the appliance maker.
这仅仅是一个侧面。
This is only one side.
来自媒体的报道显示，在国内多个地市，口罩脱销十分常见，尤其是KN95、N95口罩，更是“一罩难求”。
Reports from the media showed that many cities in the country, sold masks are very common, especially KN95, N95 masks, is "a hard to find."
与此同时，武汉当地医院的医疗防护物资求援公告频发；国家医护物资调配动作连连……一方面是市场面临巨大缺口，而另一方面，对于包括三奇医保、蓝帆医疗等一众医疗防护用品生产企业来说，要想短期内解决医疗防护用品的供不应求仍面临制作周期，人力、物料紧张以及运输成本攀升等现实问题。
At the same time, Wuhan local hospitals frequent calls for medical and protective materials; the national medical material deployment action on the one hand is facing a huge gap, on the other hand, including Sanqi Medical, blue-sails medical supplies manufacturers, to solve the short-term supply of medical supplies are still facing production cycle, labor, material constraints and transportation costs, such as the reality.
在此背景下，亟需整合产业链资源，协同作战。
Under this background, the urgent need to integrate industrial chain resources, coordinated operations.
毕竟一己之力终有限，事关该链条的每一个角色都十分关键。
After all, self-reliance is limited, and every role in the chain is crucial.
蓝帆医疗倡议，目前包括该公司在内的国内防护用品生产企业已大多在紧急开展口罩、手套、防护服、护目镜、消毒湿巾、消毒液的增产，但因需求陡然增大，供应仍然紧张。
The BlueSail Medical Initiative, which currently includes the company, is already working mostly to increase production of respirators, gloves, protective clothing, goggles, disinfectant wipes and disinfectant on an emergency basis, but supply remains tight due to a sharp increase in demand.
为此，已紧急联系长期以来与公司存在密切业务往来的多家境外防护用品供应商、经销商，尽快组织货源向疫区平价发送前述亟需的防护用品。
For this reason, we have urgently contacted a number of overseas protection suppliers and distributors with which the company has had close business for a long time, and have organized supply sources to send the aforementioned urgently needed protective articles to epidemic areas at par as soon as possible.
“在这特殊时刻，应该打造中国医药防护行业的‘命运共同体’，平价保（障）供（应）是法则。
"At this particular moment, it is important to forge a 'common destiny' for China's medical-protection industry, where affordability is the rule.
”刘文静说。
"said Liu.
日照环宇纸制品有限公司送来的医疗防护用品包装纸箱产业链上的“兄弟”也在“抱团予暖”。
Rizhao ring-woo Paper Products Co. Ltd. sent medical protection packaging carton industry chain "brother" is also "warm in the embrace."
日照环宇纸制品有限公司的员工听说三奇医保需要医疗防护用品包装纸箱，火速回厂启动生产线，加班生产配套的10万个包装纸箱，运了过来。
The employees of Rizhao Circle Paper Products Co., Ltd. heard that Sanqi Medicare needed medical protection packaging cartons, rushed back to the factory to start the production line, overtime production matching 100,000 packaging cartons, arrived.
