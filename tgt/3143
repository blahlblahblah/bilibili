根据美国疾病控制与预防中心和各州公共卫生部门统计，截至美东时间3月8日晚7点，全美共报告新冠肺炎确诊病例572例，死亡21例，治愈10例。
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state public health departments, 572 confirmed cases of New Crown Pneumonia, 21 deaths and 10 cures had been reported nationwide by 7 p.m. March 8, 2007.
8日美国新增113例新冠肺炎，新增死亡病例2例。
On the 8th, 113 new cases of crown pneumonia and 2 new deaths were reported in the United States.
目前，新冠肺炎已波及全美34个州，华盛顿州、加利福尼亚州、佛罗里达州、肯塔基州，纽约州，马里兰州，犹他州和俄勒冈州等8州宣布进入紧急状态。
The state of emergency has been declared in 34 states, including Washington, California, Florida, Kentucky, New York, Maryland, Utah and Oregon.
特别是大华府所在的华盛顿哥伦比亚特区、马里兰州和弗吉尼亚州7日全部出现确诊病例。

在此情况下，美国的口罩也成为了紧俏商品，商家趁机哄抬口罩价格。
In this case, the United States mask has become a hot commodity, businesses take advantage of the opportunity to raise the price of masks.
北控男篮主教练马布里通过个人社交媒体发文，痛斥了哄抬物价的行为，并且认为美国政府应该免费发放口罩。
North-controlled coach Marbury sent messages via personal social media denouncing price increases and saying the US government should dispense masks for free.
马布里怒斥美国口罩太贵：一个要17美元？马布里写道：“这些公司明明知道现在人们很需要口罩，还是抬高价格，这样的行为很是可悲。
Mabry rages against US masks: $17 each? "These companies are woefully aware of the need for masks these days or of higher prices."
在别人最需要的时候哄抬物价，这样的行为简直比病毒还要可怕。
Bidding up prices when others need them most is worse than a virus.
如此的紧急关头，你们怎么能想着涨价的事情？每个人都需要口罩，但不是每个人都能得到，因为现在美国没有足够的口罩提供给每个人。
How can you think about price increases at such a critical juncture? Everyone needs masks, but not everyone can get them, because there aren't enough masks available for everyone in America right now.
相比于低廉的制造成本，一只口罩要卖到17美元，这真的太疯狂了。
It's crazy to charge $17 for a mask compared with the low cost of manufacturing.
政府应该免费发放口罩的，这样才可以确保人们的安全。
The government should dispense masks free of charge to ensure people's safety.
”马布里还写道：“请赶紧戴上口罩！仅仅是用消毒液来洗手不足以避免你被感染。
"Put on your mask quickly," Marbury wrote. "Washing your hands with disinfectant alone is not enough to keep you from getting infected.
情况要远远比我们所想象的更加严重。
The situation is far more serious than we thought.
一定要照顾好那些有呼吸系统疾病的老人家，他们更加容易感染病毒，也要让他们远离人群密集的地方。
Care must be taken of elderly people with respiratory illnesses, who are more susceptible to the virus and should be kept away from crowded places.
”美国副总统喊话“没病别买口罩”背后：不是没用，是没货《纽约时报》报道称，当地时间3月5日，美国副总统迈克·彭斯调研口罩制造商3M公司时呼吁美国民众，“如果普通民众没有生病就不要购买口罩。
"Behind the US Vice President's" Don't buy a mask, "the New York Times reported. On March 5, Vice President Mike Burns, while researching 3M, called on Americans not to buy masks if the general public is not sick.
”事实上，这已经不是彭斯第一次发出这样的呼吁了。
Indeed, this was not the first time Burns had made such an appeal.
当地时间2月29日，彭斯就曾在白宫召开的新闻发布会上表示，美国民众没必要购买防御新冠病毒的口罩，应该优先让医护人员获得口罩。
At a White House news conference on Feb. 29, Burns said people don't need to buy masks to protect themselves from the new cap virus.
随着美国新冠肺炎病例数量不断上升，电商平台上，口罩及其他防护用品的价格一路飙升。
As the number of cases of pneumonia in the United States continues to rise, prices for masks and other protective devices have soared on electric platforms.
《金融时报》3月3日报道称，在亚马逊网站上，有些商家甚至将免洗洗手液和口罩的价格提升至日常零售价的2000%。
Some businesses on Amazon.com have even raised the price of hand sanitizers and masks to 2,000 per cent of the daily retail price, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday.
该报道称，在亚马逊网站上，某个未经授权的零售商出售一包20只装的3M口罩，要价高达387美元，而正常零售价仅为14.99美元。
On Amazon, an unauthorized retailer sells a 20-pack of 3M masks for as much as $387, compared with a regular retail price of $14.99, the report said.

彭博新闻社报道称，美国卫生与公共服务部（HHS）预计，如果新冠肺炎大规模爆发，美国将需要35亿只口罩。
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) expects 3.5 billion face masks to be needed in the event of a major outbreak of pneumonia, Bloomberg reported.
美国消费者新闻与商业频道（CNBC）3月4日报道，美国卫生与公共服务部指出，一旦新冠病毒肺炎成为流行病，美国的口罩储备只够医护人员所需的1%。
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services says it has only 1% of its supply of face masks needed by health-care workers in the event of an outbreak of the new crown pneumonia.
口罩生产公司Prestige Ameritech的执行副总裁迈克·鲍恩表示，此次危机为美国的医院敲响了警钟，此前他们都是从国外供应商手中购买口罩。
Mike Bowen, executive vice president of mask-making firm Prestige Americas, says the crisis is a wake-up call for hospitals in the United States, which previously bought masks from foreign suppliers.

The Trump administration has granted an exemption to import tariffs on more than 100 medical products imported from China, including masks, gloves and disinfectant wipes, US media reported on Monday.
报道称，美国政府这次批准了27家企业的关税豁免申请。
The US government has approved 27 applications for exemption from customs duties, the report said.
这些企业在1月31日的截止日期之前，提交了申请，那时疫情主要发生在中国，但是美国公司已着手准备应对国内流行的情况了。
The companies submitted their applications by the Jan. 31 deadline, when the outbreak was mostly in China, but U.S. companies were bracing themselves for a domestic epidemic.
根据路透社报道，相较往常，此次这些企业的申请处理流程，明显被加快了。
According to Reuters, the processing of applications by these companies has been noticeably speeded up.
其他自中国进口产品的免关税申请审批往往要耗时数月之久。
Other duty-free applications from Chinese imports often take months to process.
苹果公司去年10月31日，就提交了耳机和智能音箱的关税豁免申请，至今仍未有结果。
Apple filed for a tariff exemption for headphones and smart speakers on Oct. 31 last year, but it has yet to come to fruition.
