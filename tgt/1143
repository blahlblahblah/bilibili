____这几天，有媒体称“风月同天”不如“武汉加油”，后被群嘲。
In the last few days, some media said that "the same day" than "Wuhan refueling," and was later ridiculed.
因为它背后的逻辑，并不是在讨论“灾难当头可否允许诗意停留”，而是把诗意直接当作非日常的存在，好像感风吟月都是特殊的情绪仪式，平日里不好随意散发的，非得诗人摇起折扇才行——这种逻辑将诗意剔除于生活之外，但诗意本该是日常。
For the logic behind it is not to talk of "whether disaster permits poetic stays," but to treat poetry directly as if it were a non-everyday existence, as if the month were special moods that are not normally easy to dispense, and which must be tossed aside by the poet - logic that leaves poetry out of life, but poetry should be everyday.
四处封城之下，我有所念人，隔在远远乡；医生奔赴前线，市民投喂美食，这是投我以木瓜，报之以琼琚；每一个变黑的数字背后，都有感时花溅泪，恨别鸟惊心。
Under the four walls I have read, And far from home; The doctors go to the front, And the citizens feed me fine things, And in return, K. juniper, And behind every darkened number, There are tears, And hating birds.
当一句诗、一阕词在心头闪过，我们便仿佛相隔千年与故人心意相通、愁肠相诉。
When a poem, a tie down word flashed through our hearts, we seemed to be separated from the hearts of the old people for thousands of years, sad mutually told.
却有人居然觉得，写诗这件事文艺到配不上严肃的抗疫行动……相比没文化这件事，我倒觉得“诗意还需要被人决定它的去留”更可怕。
But some people think that the matter of writing poetry is not worthy of serious anti-epidemic action...... compared to the case of uneducated, I feel that "poetic also need to be determined by its fate" more terrible.
相比没文化这件事，我还觉得看到几句诗就惊艳得不行最可怕，因为那等于在说：我们的生活已经离诗很远了。
Compared to the matter of illiteracy, I also think that a few words of poetry on the shocking do not be the most terrible, because it is to say: our lives have been far from poetry.
想起曾经看到的一个高票问答，印象很深：“我们为什么要读诗？”“为了长大以后我们面对三千世界里的无数美景时，脑子里出现的不是‘我X’‘牛B’，而是‘落霞与孤鹜齐飞，秋水共长天一色’。
In order to grow up to face the myriad beauties of the 3,000-world situation, we have in mind not 'I' X 'and' ox B 'but' sunset and star after star '.
”来听听身处武汉的诗人小引怎么说——____小引：男，1969年出生，现居武汉。
To hear from Xiao Quan, a poet in Wuhan, who was born in 1969 and lives in Wuhan.
著有诗集《北京时间》，《即兴曲》。
Author of poetry anthology "Beijing time", "instant song."
散文集《悲伤省》，《世间所有的寂静 此刻都在这里》。
A collection of essays, "Sad Province," "All the quietness in the world is here right now."
口述 | 小　引整理 | 阿　布我们有别的表达方式我在武汉。
A: We have other ways of expressing ourselves at Wuhan.
今天是封城第二十二天。
Today is the 22nd day of the city.
这两天，因为日本友人捐赠援华物资的事情，闹得沸沸扬扬。
These two days, because the Japanese friends donate the matter of aid to China, caused uproar.
有意思的是，舆论场的焦点并非是物资问题，而是包装盒上的几句唐诗。
Interestingly, the focus of the opinion field was not on the material issue, but on a few Tang poems on the box.
按照平常的想法，这事情类似于隔壁的人看你生病了，上门来送个花篮，水果，顺便写了拜帖，上面写了几句客气话。
According to the usual way of thinking, it was similar to the people next door who saw you sick, came to the door with a basket of flowers, fruit, and dropped by to write a few kind words.
按照传统中国的习俗，礼尚往来，应该好烟好茶招待一下。
According to the traditional Chinese customs, etiquette exchange, should smoke good tea to entertain.
是什么让日本援华物资上出现那些感人的诗词？在我看来，无外乎是因为：灾难面前，日本人觉得中国应该还是那个中国。
What made Japan's aid to China so touching? It seemed to me only because, in the face of disaster, the Japanese felt that China should still be that China.
我也在朋友圈中，表达了对看见几句唐诗就一窝蜂惊诧莫名的不满。
I also expressed in the circle of friends, to see a few Tang poetry on the hordes of surprise inexplicable dissatisfaction.
许多人回帖，大多在谈中日两国文化的传承发展变化及差距。
Many people replied, mostly about the cultural heritage between China and Japan and the development of the gap.
其中最精彩的一个回帖是南京作家曹宼说的：“问题是，我没觉得引用诗词就叫文化。
One of the best replies was from Cao Zu, a Nanjing writer: "The problem is, I don't think quoting poetry is culture.
但说中国人没文化大概也没问题，因为他们看到几句诗词都要惊艳。
But to say that the Chinese are illiterate is probably no problem, because they see a few lines of poetry are amazing.
”但似乎并不那么简单。
But it doesn't seem that simple.
背几句唐诗并不说明谁有文化，谁没有文化，但是它在这个非常尴尬的时代中猛然让人想起，原来我们还有不被裹挟的别的表达方式，别的情感模式，别的思维路径。
A few lines of Tang poetry do not tell us who is literate, who is illiterate, but it suddenly reminds us in this very awkward time that we have other expressions, other emotional patterns, alternative ways of thinking.
那是另外一个“不一样”的世界，它从汉唐宋元来，从浩荡的明月中来，从奔腾的江水中来，从无数中华文明的瑰宝中来，岂止是简单的四六句那么简单？封城二十二天了，我们每个人的生活都发生了巨大的变化。
It is another "different" world, it came from Han, Tang and Song Dynasties, from the vast moonlight, from the running rivers, from the countless treasures of Chinese civilization, it is more than a simple four or six sentences.
我们看到了很多不幸，似乎再也不能像从前那样生活了。
We have seen many misfortunes, and it seems that we can no longer live as we did before.
这才是困扰我们大家的一个共同问题。
That is a common problem that plagues us all.
灾难之后，写诗并非是野蛮的，用无耻的言论继续灾难才是野蛮的。
Poetry is not barbaric after disaster, and it is barbaric to continue disaster with shameless words.
而反抗这种野蛮的唯一办法，就是真实，持续且坚定的写作，唯有这样，才能让谎言失去生命，让真相挺身而出；唯有这样，才能让阳光透过雾霾，重新照亮那些干枯的花园，寂寥的人间。
The only way to fight against this barbarity is to write truthfully, persistently and steadfastly. Only in this way can lies lose their lives and the truth come out. Only in this way can the sun shine through the haze and light up the dry gardens and lonely lives.
武汉疫情爆发后，小引一直在征集“戴口罩的中国诗人”群像，这是他收集到的部分诗人照片。
After the outbreak of the epidemic in Wuhan, Xiao Qun has been collecting images of "Chinese poets wearing masks," some of which he collected from poets.
当诗人戴上口罩，你还能认出他们吗？人类只能暂时臣服封城二十多天，有点像自囚，终于把作息时间彻底颠倒了。
Can you recognize the poets when they wear masks? Humans can only submit to the city for more than twenty days, a little like a prisoner, and finally turn the clock upside down.
特别是最近一周，已经可以通宵不睡，直到早上五点才困倦。
Especially in the last week, you can stay up all night until 5am when you are sleepy.
一觉睡到中午十二点，武汉话叫“睡转了钟”。
A sleep until 12 noon, Wuhan dialect called "sleep around the clock."
起来倒也不觉得昏沉，只是心生一丝奇怪的感觉，这是过年，也是避难，睁眼一看，窗外的天气无非三种：晴天，雨天和阴天。
It was a Chinese New Year and a refuge. When I opened my eyes, the weather outside my window was nothing but three kinds: sunny days, rainy days and cloudy days.
我住的小区有4栋，每栋30层，每栋基本上都有几个确诊病人，保护隐私没有对外公布门牌号，居民大都关门闭户，不怎么出门。
I live in a quarter of four, each 30-story, each basically a few diagnosed patients, privacy protection did not disclose the number of doors, residents are closed, rarely out of the house.
小区在三所大学的包围圈内，平时永远是学生来来往往的热闹，一下子变得这么安静，感觉挺古怪的。
The neighborhood is surrounded by three universities, usually students will always come and go lively, all of a sudden become so quiet, it feels strange.
我从没想过一座一千万人的城市会突然看不见人了——站在自家凉台上望出去，觉得自己也特别奇怪，有一种很不真实的感觉，但其实又是真的。
It never occurred to me that a city of ten million people would suddenly lose sight of people - standing on its balcony and thinking that it was very strange, that it had a very unreal feeling, but it was true.
每天的伙食还是一个很大的消耗，身边的24小时便利店和大型商圈都关门了，但是超市还在坚持营业，武汉的盒马、武商超市，覆盖率比较高，可以方便地买到蔬果肉禽蛋和生活物资。
The 24-hour convenience store and the large shopping mall are closed, but the supermarket is still open. Wuhan Boxer and Wu Hui supermarkets have high coverage and can easily buy fruits, vegetables, eggs and daily necessities.
说段武汉话：在支付宝里头找到了代购，买鸡蛋、米、油，下单，好几分钟冒的人接。
Said paragraph Wuhan: in pay treasure found in the buying agent, to buy eggs, rice, oil, order, several minutes of people to take.
加鸟十块钱，重新下单，这回蛮快，秒接。
Add bird ten dollars, re-order, this time quite fast, seconds to take.
到楼下收快递小哥送来的代购物资，果然加了钱，服务好，速度快。
To the downstairs to pick up courier delivery of supplies, really added money, good service, fast.
别个规规矩矩，几多钱，包装得好好的，还怕您伢传染了，用个塑料袋包到把手送过来。
Don't be so formal, how much money is packed so well that you are afraid of being so infected that you put a plastic bag into your hand and send it.
小区大门口站到结账，我们两个人戴到口罩，相隔两米，旁边一个防化服物业，冷静地拿到测温枪瞄到我们。
The neighborhood gate to the checkout, we two people wearing masks, two meters apart, next to a chemical-proof property, coolly took the temperature gun aimed at us.
我感觉有点像犯了点莫事情，到派出所的感觉。
I feel kind of like I made a little bit of a mistake to get to the police station.
二十多天除了出门买菜，就整天穿着秋衣秋裤在书房中转悠。
More than 20 days in addition to shopping outside, wearing autumn clothes autumn trousers in the study around all day.
把地暖打到50度了，还觉得不够，热烘烘的，据说病毒害怕这个——否则为什么到了五六月病毒就消失了？这当然是猜测，没有确认的科学依据。
Warm the ground to 50 degrees, still not enough, hot, said the virus is afraid of this - otherwise why the virus disappeared in May and June? This is certainly speculation, there is no scientific basis for confirmation.
在武汉湿冷的冬天，900万人自我封闭二十多天，近乎于一项伟大的行为艺术。
In Wuhan, the wet and cold winter, 9 million people self-closed for more than 20 days, almost a great act of art.
不过前提我要声明，并非所有的人都是主动自我封闭的，强烈度的传染疾病，让主动和被动在此刻消失了界限，这其实是臣服，人类在病毒面前，应该保持谦卑。
But let me make it clear that not all people are active, self-contained, highly contagious diseases, so that active and passive in the moment of the disappearance of the boundaries, this is really obedient, humanity in the face of the virus, should remain humble.
武汉现在就像是计算机关机了武汉人一直都胆子挺大，今年元月初的时候大家还满不在乎，官方有万人宴，民间也到处都有封闭场馆里众人聚集的跨年庆贺活动。
Wuhan is now like a computer shutdown Wuhan people have been quite bold, the beginning of January this year when people do not care enough, there are official mass banquet, people everywhere closed venues gathered in the New Year celebrations.
李文亮医生的消息传出后各路消息在民间也是满天飞，大家会互相提醒，但是因为没有官方认证，所以生活并没有发生变化。
When the news of Dr. Li Wenliang spread, people would warn each other, but there was no official certification, so life did not change.
封城的前几天我还在和朋友吃饭，一位朋友是医生，吃完饭第二天跟我们说，出事了，他一个同事发烧了，等着出检验结果，“如果他感染了，那我也要隔离了，你们也危险了。
A friend of mine, a doctor, told us the next day that something had happened. A colleague of his had a fever and was waiting for the test results.
”我们和他一起等消息，等到8点，说没事了，警报解除——这个病毒不是直接判你死刑，但是永远在给你一种威慑，让你感觉离死亡很近。
We waited with him until eight o'clock, when the alarm went away - the virus wasn't going to kill you directly, but it was always giving you a deterrent and making you feel close to death.
对于每一个没有被传染的人来说都是心理压力，很微妙。
It's psychological pressure on everyone who's not infected. It's subtle.
今年原本打算去西藏过年，已经提前大半个月订好了机票，但是宣布“人传人”以后我就退票了，很快武汉就封城了——封城让我感到这次的情况非同一般，好像又来了一次非典。
This year I had planned to go to Tibet for the Spring Festival, but I booked a ticket half a month in advance, but I announced that I would refund the tickets after the announcement, and soon Wuhan closed the city.
但武汉人对非典的记忆是不强烈的。
But Wuhan people to SARS memory is not strong.
刚开始封城的一段时间是大家最恐慌的时候，现在二十多天过去，变得有些麻木，900万人说不出门就不出门，病毒改变了我们的日常生活节奏，退化到最简单的起居、喂饱自己、睡足觉。
The initial period of closure was the most terrifying of all, and now more than 20 days have passed and become somewhat numb, with 9 million people saying that they stay home without going out. The virus has changed the pace of our daily lives, degenerating into the simplest form of living, feeding ourselves and sleeping.
我一直在想一个问题：等病毒过去之后，我们还会像以前一样生活得肆无忌惮吗？这还不只是不接触野生动物的问题。
I've been wondering: will we live as recklessly as ever after the virus is over? It's not just a matter of not being in contact with wild animals.
像武汉这样的超大型城市，再加上越来越快捷的城际交通网络，病毒也坐上了高铁，去到了从前轻易到不了的地方。
Mega-cities like Wuhan, coupled with increasingly fast inter-city transportation networks, have put viruses on high-speed rail to places previously inaccessible.
超大型城市对周边务工人员的无限吸纳，当灾难来临时也会直接变成病毒的吐纳。
Mega-cities to the surrounding workers unlimited absorption, when the disaster will also be directly into the vomiting of the virus.
这让我想起早年的386计算机，如果中毒了没办法就只好断电、关机。
This reminds me of 386 computers in my early years. If I was poisoned, I had to turn off the electricity and turn off the machine.
武汉现在就像是计算机关机了，但我们不能永远这样，杀敌一万自损三千。
Wuhan is now like a computer shutdown, but we can not always like this, killing 10,000 enemy self-harm 3000.
这次的病毒不仅仅是医学、科技面临的问题，也对现代文明的社会结构提出了新的课题——飞速发展的城市，如何分层防御？这也是社会学面临的问题——我们该如何更科学地构建社会结构？汉口中山大道空荡荡，凯德广场冷冷清清群光二路的囤货青年汉口火车站地下停车场价格不便宜，可是再贵也要买那么我只好跳广场舞了朋友圈中有许多自由散漫的人，我自己也是其中之一。
This virus is not only a medical, scientific and technological problem, but also a new problem to the social structure of modern civilization - the rapid development of cities, how to stratify defense?
我说的“自由散漫”是针对某些具体的、更自我的生活而言。
What I mean by "free play" is something specific, something more self-centered.
比如昨天上午，五号艺术车间的老陈独自上街，拍摄空无一人的大街，他一边拍一边说，这里有1000万伏兵。
Yesterday morning, for example, old Chen, from Art Shop No. 5, went out into the street alone to shoot an empty street.
我调侃他说，老陈你是一艘草船，如今终于可以随波逐流了。
I tease him, old Chen you are a grass boat, now can finally drift with the tide.
老陈回答我说，我是大雾，你是垛子，老方才是草船。
Lao Chen replied to me, I am a big fog, you are ricks, old square is the grass boat.
他说的老方，就是“者名”酒吧的“者名”老板方文，疫情最严重的时候，他一个人跑去江滩踢足球，阳光灿烂，万里无云，天气好得让人有点不安，方文在空荡荡的江滩感叹：这真他妈的是浪费啊！我有个朋友在派出所工作，方舱刚建好，要把各个社区的轻症患者转移过去。
At the height of the epidemic, he ran alone to the beach to play football. The sun was bright and cloudless, the weather was a bit restless. Fang wen lamented in the empty river bank: This is a goddamn waste!
他的辖区大概转移了四五十人，各种思想工作，行李，手续，接送等等。
His district had transferred about forty or fifty men, all sorts of mental work, luggage, formalities, hauling, and so on.
好不容易把人送到了洪山体育馆，回到所里准备晚餐，忽然接到电话，说你们送来的人，跑了两个。
At last he took the man to Hongshan Stadium and returned to the institute to prepare dinner. Suddenly he got a call saying that the man you sent him had run two.
我那朋友没办法，重新披挂上阵，追索失踪感染人员，最后把人堵在了家里，问，你感染了进方舱，为什么要跑回家呢？答，那边太吵，睡不着。
My friend had no choice but to get back on the bandwagon, to track down the missing man, and finally to stop him at home, and to ask, Why did you run home when you got into the cabin?
问，你回来不怕感染到家人吗？答，他们都欢迎我回来……一整天，十八个小时，十几个人的工作就消耗在人员转送之中。
Ask, are you not afraid to come back and infect your family? Answer, they all welcome me back... All day, 18 hours, a dozen people's jobs are consumed in the transfer.
我只是讲述这个故事，荒诞，但又真实，是简化版的《飞越疯人院》。
I'm just telling this story, absurd, but true, a simplified version of Overflight of the Looney Bin.
像麦克·默菲·方文这样的人，如果你把他丢进方舱，他也会要求，方舱开一个酒吧病房，让我们喜欢喝酒的病友们在一起，相互照看，恢复得会更快一些。
A man like Mike Murphy Fangwen, if you throw him in the cabin, will also ask that a bar ward be opened in the cabin so that our fellow drinkers can stay together, look after each other and recover more quickly.
如果护士反对的话，麦克·默菲·方文会说，那么我只好跳广场舞了。
If the nurse objects, said Mike Murphy Founder, then I have to dance in the square.
苍蝇神奇地消失了下午偷偷下楼转了一圈，小区花园中静悄悄的，连个苍蝇都没有。
The flies magically disappeared. In the afternoon they slipped downstairs and went for a walk. There was no flies in the garden.
我前几天就发现这个问题了，武汉疫情爆发以来，苍蝇神奇地消失了。
I discovered this a few days ago, Wuhan outbreak of the outbreak of the fly magically disappeared.
我不知道汉口汉阳其他地方的朋友注意到这个问题没有？站在干枯的喷水池旁抽烟，这拜占庭式的古罗马趣味，加上中国风的假山，没有水流经过，显得破旧，狭隘，毫无生气。
I wonder if friends elsewhere in Hankou Hanyang notice the problem? Standing by a dry fountain smoking, this Byzantine Roman taste, coupled with the Chinese-style mountains, looks shabby, parochial and lifeless without water.
隔壁一栋楼有我一个朋友，中午跟我有一句没一句地聊天，我猜，他是想跟我约在楼下花坛见面抽烟，我憋着没搭茬，心里想，两个被困在同一个小区的“麦克·默菲”是不应该见面的，我们可以像余则成那样，路过好像不认识，地下党应该讲规矩。
I guess he wanted to meet me downstairs at the flower bed to smoke. I didn't bother to think that two Mike Murphy, trapped in the same neighborhood, shouldn't have met.
否则每天火锅一炖，毛铺酒一开，哪里有点疫区人民的样子。
Otherwise, every day a pot stew, wool shop wine, where there is a bit of epidemic area people's appearance.
隔壁那栋楼的兄弟好像不依不饶，晚上又跟我发了一条微信——“每天下午和晚上，我和小吴都会在小区里散步，活动筋骨……”这是一个潜伏者的标配语言，下面就是接头暗语了。
The brother in the building next door seemed adamant, and in the evening he sent me a message. "Every afternoon and evening, Xiao Wu and I would walk around the neighborhood, stretching our muscles..."
但我当时正在吃饭，没来得及回，我想，是应该下去跟他交换一下情报了，也不知道他家的物资储备足没有。
But I was having dinner, and before I could get back, I thought, I ought to go down and exchange information with him, and not know whether his stock of goods was sufficient.
其实今天出了一趟门。
In fact, I went out today.
老高说他的口罩消耗殆尽，只有最后两只了。
Gao said his mask was worn out, only the last two.
恰好我这里有浙江诗人津渡以及另外两个朋友寄来的口罩，我说你正好过来盒马生鲜购物补仓，我跟你送过去。
I happen to have a mask from the poet Jindo of Zhejiang Province and two other friends. I said that you just came to the box to fill the barn. I'll take it with you.
下午三点，老高在空旷的路口等我，我想既然出了门，干脆陪他去超市买点东西吧？虽然家里好像也不缺什么。
At three o'clock in the afternoon, Lao Gao waited for me at an empty intersection. I thought I would accompany him to the supermarket to buy something since I was out of the house.
路过华师后门的酒吧街，那里已经空寂了一个月。
I passed the bar street behind Hua Shi's back door. It had been deserted for a month.
精酿啤酒、羊蝎子、串串香、东北饺子馆、黄焖鸡米饭……想起其实每家老板都蛮可爱，熟悉了，这个可以打折，那个也可以打折，我有点担心这疫情时间太长了，恐怕中间很多人，就不会回来了。
Brewed beer, scorpion, string incense, northeast dumpling restaurant, chicken stew rice... think of the fact that every boss is pretty cute, familiar, this can be discounted, that can be discounted, I am a little worried that this epidemic has been too long, I am afraid many of the middle will not return.
两个人散步去盒马，碰见一群年轻人骑着自行车在街上溜达，我感慨一声，现在的孩子们胆子真不小。
Two people walking to a box of horses, encountered a group of young people riding bicycles around the streets, I sigh, the children are really not too bold.
有个女孩骑车走在后面，回了我一句，我们没菜吃啦！嘻嘻哈哈，顺着下坡转眼就远去。
A girl cycled in the back, replied me, we did not have food! Hip-hop, along the downhill on the far side.
失联几十年，兄弟可重聚诗人刘不伟下午在网上发了一个寻人启事，上面说，自己的大伯在武汉，90年代初见过一面，之后失联了26年，渺无音讯。
Brother can reunite poet Liu Buwei in the afternoon of a search notice on the Internet, said his uncle in Wuhan, in the early 1990s met, then lost 26 years, no news.
这次武汉疫情举国震动，刘不伟的父亲年迈之际，思念自己的哥哥，嘱托不伟上网搜寻。
This Wuhan epidemic shook the whole country, Liu Buwei's father aged, thinking of his brother, would like to entrust Wei online search.
我把寻人消息发到同学群中，没想到天遂人愿，竟迅速得到了回应。
I sent the search information to the students, I did not expect Tiansui people to wish, but quickly received a response.
他的大伯和我同学的父亲竟然是一个单位，且私交甚密，得此讯息，感涕欢喜。
His uncle and my classmate's father are actually a unit, and very intimate, get this message, tears happy.
据说这个世界上，任何一个陌生人只需要转三个弯，就会找到另外一个人，看来是真的。
It is said that any stranger in the world need only turn three turns to find another person, which seems to be true.
不伟私下里跟我说，自己的父亲解放初在辽阳读书，大伯去了长春读书，后来兄弟离散，各奔东西，风云变幻之际，谁也不敢轻易联系对方。
Xiao Wei told me in private that his father was studying in Liaoyang in the early liberation of his father, who went to Changchun to study.
直到70年代末有过一次接触，90年代初又见过一次，然后再也没有了消息。
There was one contact in the late 1970s, another in the early 1990s, and then no news at all.
我理解那个时代中的个人命运，就如风吹落尘，洒满大地。
I understand the personal fate of that era, like the wind blowing dust, sprinkling the earth.
到了垂暮之年，每个人都会思念起自己的故土和亲人，鞍山的春天，沈阳的夏天，刘不伟充满渴望地跟我描述自己父辈的情景，就像一部老电影中的慢镜头，好看又伤感。
In his twilight years, everyone will miss his native land and loved ones, Anshan spring, Shenyang summer, Liu Buwei anxiously described to me his parents, like a slow film in an old movie, beautiful and sad.
这是灰暗冰凉的武汉疫情中温暖的一幕。
It was a warm scene amid the bleak, bleak Wuhan outbreak.
岂曰无衣，与子同裳，说的大约就是这个意思。
Is there no clothes, and children with the same clothes, said about this meaning.
希望两位老人身体健康，希望他们能够在灾后的武汉相聚，就约在黄鹤楼下吧，大江东去，多少传奇，正在此刻的传奇。
I hope that the two elderly health, hope that they can meet in the post-disaster Wuhan, about the Yellow Crane Tower, the Yellow Crane Tower, many legends, is the legend of the moment.
