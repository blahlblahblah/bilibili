李文亮生前发给中青报·中青网记者杨海的照片中青报·中青网记者杨海2月7日凌晨2点58分，感染新冠肺炎的武汉市中心医院眼科大夫李文亮抢救无效去世。
Yang Hai, an ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital who contracted pneumonia on Feb. 7, died at 2: 58 am after receiving an ophthalmologist from Wuhan Central Hospital who contracted pneumonia.
2月2日，他在自己的头条号上更新自己的病情，他说前一天自己的新冠肺炎核酸检测终于出了结果，是阳性，自己被感染的父母已经出院，“谢谢大家的关心”。
On February 2, he updated his condition on his headline. He said his Nucleic Acid (Nucleic Acid) test had turned out the day before. He was positive and his infected parents had been discharged.
他微信上依旧保留着“理论是灰色的,生命之树常青”的签名。
The signature of "Theory is Grey, The Tree of Life" is still on his micro-letter.

他的微信头像是一幅蜡笔小新的漫画1月31日，他接受了中青报·中青网记者的采访，这时，他已经住院19天。
His head is a cartoon crayon Xiaoxin, January 31, he was interviewed by the Zhongqing News Network reporters, when he had been in hospital for 19 days.
以下是记者与李文亮的对话实录：记者：现在身体状况怎么样？李文亮：精神和食欲好很多，但还是呼吸困难，不能活动，要绝对卧床休息。
Li Wenliang: He has a lot of mental and appetite, but he still has difficulty breathing and is unable to move, so he should stay in bed absolutely.
我的肺功能恢复得比较慢，其他还好。
My lungs are recovering more slowly. The rest are fine.
记者：你当时怎么发现有SARS病毒这个消息的？判断的依据是什么？向上反映了吗？领导怎么决定的？李文亮：当时是同事发给我一个患者的检测报告，上面临床病原体筛查结果显示，<高置信度>阳性指标里，第一项就是SARS冠状病毒。
Reporter: How did you find out about the SARS virus? What was the basis of your judgment? Did it reflect upward? How did the leadership decide? Lee Wenliang: It was a colleague who gave me a report from a patient with clinical pathogen screening.
因为不是我的病人，我也不好向领导报告。
Since it's not my patient, I can't report to the leader.
记者：你是什么时候判断这次肺炎是人传人的？那时感到害怕吗？李文亮：1月9号时，我接诊了一个病人，然后得知这个病人和他的家属相继感染，我就确定这个病存在人传人了。
Reporter: When did you decide that pneumonia was a human-to-human disease? Was it scared? Li Wenliang: On January 9, I treated a patient and learned that the patient and his family were infected one after another.
很快，1月10日我自己就出现了咳嗽症状，11日我就开始发热，那时我感到了害怕。
Soon, on January 10, I had my own cough symptoms, and on the 11th I began to have a fever.
记者：为什么害怕？你当时对这个病毒的致病性是怎么考虑的？李文亮：我怕不能恢复。
Reporter: Why are you afraid? What did you think about the pathogenicity of the virus? Lim Wenliang: I'm afraid I can't recover.
我当时咨询了呼吸内科的同事，他们觉得这次病毒的致病性可能不及SARS，然后安慰我年轻，没有什么特效药，就是熬时间。
I consulted my colleagues in the Department of Respiratory Medicine, who thought the virus might be less pathogenic than SARS, and comforted me that I was young and had no specific cure.
记者：你12月30日就得知了病毒信息，自己为什么还被感染了？李文亮：因为我是眼科的，没想到这么快就接触到相关病人，有些大意了。
Reporter: You learned about the virus on December 30th, why did you get infected? Li Wenliang: Because I am an ophthalmologist, I didn't expect to get in touch with the patient so soon.
现在想想，一切来得太快了，太快了。
Now think about it, it all happened so fast, so fast.
记者：入院后你做病毒核酸检测了吗？为什么一直没有检测结果？李文亮：我也不清楚为什么一直没有确诊结果，但是我最近又做了检测，结果显示是阴性。
Reporter: Did you get viral nucleic acid test after admission? Why hasn't it been tested? Li Wenliang: I don't know why it hasn't been confirmed.
记者：你看过自己的CT吗？那是什么样的？李文亮：第二次检查时，影像结果已经很不好了。
Reporter: Have you seen your own CT? What is that? Liang Wen Liang: When the second examination, the image results were very bad.
但是都是意料之中的，我知道这个病有个发展过程。
But as expected, I knew there was a progression of the disease.
当时我不能离开高流量吸氧，侧个身都要喘很久，挺痛苦的。
I couldn't leave the high flow of oxygen, the side of the body have to take a long time, very painful.
（记者注：李文亮提供的CT影像显示，在他第二次检查时，肺部已经有80%左右的区域变白。
(Note: CT images provided by Li Wenliang show that by the time of his second examination, about 80% of his lungs had turned white.
）记者：你觉得自己在微信群里说的是谣言吗？为什么要签字？李文亮：我觉得我说的不是谣言，我是医生，我相信检测结果。
) Journalist: Do you think what you said in the microphone group was rumor? Why did you sign it? Lim Wenliang: I don't think I'm just saying rumors.
而且后来我也强调是冠状病毒，具体还在分型。
And then I also emphasized that it was a coronavirus, specifically in the classification.
我之所以签字，是因为我想让这件事赶快过去。
I signed it because I wanted to get this thing over quickly.
从派出所出来后，我还放松了些，毕竟没有被拘留，没想到后面发生了这么多事。
After coming out of the police station, I also relaxed a little, after all, was not detained, did not expect that so many things happened behind.
记者：国家疾控中心的专家说你们是可敬的，你怎么看？李文亮：我只是个普通人，不是什么英雄。
Journalist: The CDC experts say you are respectable, what do you thinkLiWenLiang: I am just an ordinary person, not a hero.
但如果大家更早知道疫情，提早防护，肯定情况比现在更好。
But if everyone knew about the outbreak earlier, protection would have been better than it is now.
记者：12月30日，你把疫情信息发到同学群里后，他们有做什么准备吗？李文亮：他们很多人买了口罩，也提醒了家人。
Reporter: After you sent the epidemic information to your classmates on December 30th, what did they do? Li Wenliang: Many of them bought masks and reminded their families.
截图外传后，大家也为我担心，为我鸣不平。
After the screenshot spread, everybody also worried for me, for me to complain.
记者：医院是从什么时候开始通知医生注意防护的？以什么形式通知的？李文亮：大概是1月10日左右，医院开完会，科室传达我们要注意防护，三级预防。
Reporter: Since when did the hospital first inform the doctor about the protection? In what form? Li Wenliang: About January 10, the hospital closed the meeting and the department conveyed that we should pay attention to the protection, tertiary prevention.
但当时恐怕做不到完全的三级防护。
But I'm afraid there was no complete level-III protection.
记者：如果整件事重新来一遍，你会怎么做？李文亮：我应该还是会提醒同学们注意。
Journalist: What would you do if the whole thing were to be repeated? Lim Wenliang: I should still remind my classmates.
记者：康复后你还会当大夫吗？你会让自己的孩子选择这份职业吗？李文亮：我还会当的，没有别的技能。
Journalist: Will you still be a doctor after you recover? Will you let your children choose this career? Lim Wenliang: I'll take it again. No other skills.
但是我应该不会建议我的孩子当医生了，风险太高。
But I wouldn't advise my child to become a doctor. It's too risky.
记者：你现在最挂念的是什么？李文亮：最挂念我的家人，我的父母还在住院，我的爱人现在怀着孕。
Reporter: What do you most care about now? Lim Wenliang: I miss my family most, my parents are still in hospital, and my wife is pregnant now.
现在什么都不重要了，我希望疫情赶快控制住，大家都能好好的。
It doesn't matter now. I hope the epidemic is under control. We can all do well.
