新冠肺炎疫情下，重疫区湖北面临较为严重的医疗和生活物资短缺现象，口罩、防护服、护目镜、新鲜瓜果蔬菜都需要外界支援，多数企业伸出援手帮助疫区渡过难关。
With the outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia, Hubei Province is facing a serious shortage of medical treatment and supplies. Masks, protective clothing, goggles, fresh fruits and vegetables all need external support.
然而，在形势危急的当下，如何迅速调取物资并送往一线投入使用成为关键。
In a critical situation, however, it is crucial that supplies are quickly moved and brought into service on the ground.
电商平台凭借自身原有的供应链和平台优势，针对疫区需求直接采取点对点援助，第一时间给予物资支持。
Based on its own original supply chain and platform advantages, the electric business platform directly takes point-to-point assistance to epidemic areas and gives material support at the first time.
此外，封路、物流运输受阻导致农产品流通成问题，平台试图在农产品销路受损的同时搭建采、购通路并给予一定补贴，让辛苦一年的农民不受损，让城里的居民有菜吃。
In addition, blockage of road and logistics leads to problems in the circulation of agricultural products, and the platform seeks to set up access and purchase routes and subsidize agricultural sales, so that farmers who have worked hard for a year are not harmed and the inhabitants of the city are provided with food.
▲2月2日，湖北省武汉市第六人民医院，工作人员正在搬运拼多多捐赠的蔬菜水果等物资。
February 2, Wuhan City, Hubei Province, the Sixth People's Hospital, workers are carrying a lot of donated vegetables and fruits and other materials.
━━━━━一名司机和一车果蔬大年初十晚上六点，一声巨响从车后传来，这是李超第二次爆胎了。
A Driver and a Truck of Fruit and Vegetable At six o'clock in the evening, a loud noise came from the back of the car.
当时，他距离湖北荆门协和京山医院只有几十公里，车上装的是拼多多向该医院捐赠的物资，自新冠肺炎疫情发生以来，这家医院极度缺乏蔬菜水果，他这一车货正是送去救急的。
At the time, he was only a few dozen kilometers from Jingmen Hospital in Hubei Province, which was carrying supplies donated to the hospital, which was desperately short of vegetables and fruits since the outbreak of pneumonia.
李超是湖北省襄阳市的一名货车司机，疫情发生后，每天开车往乡下运送饲料给养殖场。
Li Chao, a truck driver in Xiangyang, Hubei province, drove to the countryside every day to deliver feed to farms after the outbreak.
大年初十早上10点左右，他接到一个电话，希望能协调一台车和一个司机，“赶紧运一些新鲜蔬菜水果去荆门协和京山医院，是接收新型冠状病毒肺炎患者的定点医院。
At around 10 a.m. on the 10th day of the Lunar New Year, he received a telephone call hoping to coordinate a car with a driver. He rushed some fresh vegetables and fruits to Jingmen Concord and Jingshan Hospital, the designated hospital for patients with the new coronavirus pneumonia.
”　　当时，身旁的妻子没有说话，但李超看得出来她不愿意让他出这趟车。
"His wife didn't say anything at the time, but Li Chao could see that she did not want him out of the bus.
39岁的李超家里有70岁的父母，还有一双十多岁的儿子，“万一带病毒回来传给老人和孩子就不好了”。
The 39-year-old Li Chao family has 70-year-old parents and a pair of teenage sons. "It's not good to have the virus back to the old and children."
迟疑了一两秒后，李超答应了下来，并打算亲自去送这批蔬果。
After hesitating for a second or two, Li Chao agreed to go and deliver the fruits and vegetables himself.
李超先去货场上货，这是一批拼多多定向捐给协和京山医院的新鲜蔬菜水果，迅速装好后便出发了。
Li Chao went to the cargo yard first. It was a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables donated to Conghe Jingshan Hospital.
出城的时候不到12点，李超直接往协和京山医院赶。
Less than 12 o'clock out of the city, Li Chao went straight to the Peking Mountain Hospital.
虽然做了十几年大货车司机，但平时都是跑省外的单子多，至今没去过一次京山，这是一趟完全陌生的旅程。
Although I have been a truck driver for more than ten years, I have never been to Jingshan one time. It is a totally new journey.
不过，出襄阳没多久高速路就封了，他只能绕国道走，还经历了右后副车胎爆胎、换胎。
However, Xiangyang not long after the highway closed, he had to go around the country road, but also experienced the right rear tire burst, tire change.
然而，就在转向高速路、离目的地越来越近时，另一边的车胎也在一声巨响中爆了。
However, just as the motorway turned closer to its destination, the tyre on the other side exploded with a loud noise.
这时候，李超彻底慌了：“听说医院里新鲜蔬菜紧张，拼多多好不容易募集到这些水果蔬菜，送慢了，太对不住大家。
At this time, Li Chao thoroughly panic: "I heard that the hospital fresh vegetables nervous, hard to find more fruit and vegetables, sent slow, too wrong.
”不过，好在医院那边联系师傅解决了这一障碍，晚上8点多，李超和那辆载满新鲜蔬果的货车终于到达目的地。
Luckily, however, the hospital contacted the master to solve the problem and by 8 p.m. Li Chao and the lorry, loaded with fresh fruits and vegetables, finally reached their destination.
“医院组织了不当班的医生护士一起来帮助卸货，我看到他们那一瞬间，眼泪都要掉下来。
"The hospital organized the off-duty doctors and nurses to help unload the cargo, and I saw them for a moment and the tears began to fall.
他们白天忙着接诊医治病人，晚上还要帮我卸货，真的非常感动。
They were very busy during the day attending to the patients and helping me unload the goods at night.
”　　拼多多抗疫工作组组长傅正表示，“医护人员和病人处在危险中，新鲜蔬菜水果是保障他们营养战胜疫情的必需品，但平时特别简单的事情，在这个时候做起来却非常困难，主要是筹措物资和运输很难，正是有了像李超这样的司机，我们这些物资才能抵达最需要的人那里。
"Health-care workers and patients are in danger, and fresh fruits and vegetables are essential to ensure their nutrition against the epidemic," said Fu Zheng, head of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United States.
”据傅正介绍，疫情发生后，拼多多紧急采购了超过100吨的新鲜蔬菜水果，通过物流合作伙伴，直接送抵湖北七市16家医院。
Fu said more than 100 tons of fresh fruits and vegetables were urgently purchased after the outbreak and sent directly to 16 hospitals in seven cities in Hubei province through logistics partners.
▲2月2日，湖北襄阳竹叶山市场，工作人员正在把拼多多从各地筹集的农产品物资运送到抗“疫”一线。
February 2, Hubei Xiangyang Zhuyeshan market, workers are more and more from all over the collection of agricultural products to the "epidemic" front.
━━━━━拨一通电话，换来一批口罩“你们有外科口罩吗？哪怕几十个也要。
Dr. SimpsonDialer A telephone call for a supply of masks. Do you have surgical masks? Even a few dozen.
”1月31日，拼多多“抗疫工作组”成员狄拉克接到了这通来自湖北黄冈的求助电话。
On January 31, Dirac, a member of the Dodo Task Force, received the call from Huanggang in Huanggang, Hubei Province.
打电话的是王斌，来自湖北省黄冈市新冠肺炎防控指挥部。
The caller was Wang Bin, from Huanggang City, Huanggang City, Hubei Province, to prevent and control pneumonia.
整个春节期间，王斌每天都在四处寻找医疗防护物资。
Throughout the Spring Festival, Wang Bin looked around every day for medical protection materials.
当时，全国人民关注的焦点还是武汉，然而武汉封城后几十万人返回黄冈，但医疗防护物资极度缺乏，没有装备如何打仗？　　“我每天睁开眼第一件事，就是想怎么搞到医用口罩和防护服，我们这边库存剩下不多，没有这个医院开不了门。
However, hundreds of thousands of people returned to Huanggang after the end of the city of Wuhan, but medical supplies were so scarce that they were ill equipped to fight the war.I opened my eyes first thing every day to find medical masks and protective clothing.
”王斌说。
'said Wang.
而在当时，为了节省防护服，黄冈的医务人员只能9个小时不吃饭、不喝水，一旦上厕所，一套防护服就废了。
At the time, to save money on protective clothing, medical staff in Huanggang could only eat and drink for nine hours. Once in the toilet, a suit was discarded.
王斌向拼多多求助后不到一天，1月31日晚，拼多多就向黄冈启运了首批6万多只口罩和2万只医用手套。
On the night of January 31, Wang Bin sent his first batch of more than 60,000 masks and 20,000 medical gloves to Huang Gang.
这批货刚运抵黄冈，就在指挥部的统一调配下，分发至黄冈版“小汤山”——黄冈市中心医院大别山区域医疗中心等定点医院的一线医护人员手中。
The goods have just arrived in Huanggang, under the unified command of the command, distributed to the Huanggang version of "Xiaotangshan" - Huanggang City Central Hospital Dabie Hill Regional Medical Center and other designated hospitals hands.
事实上，物资紧缺的不止黄冈。
In fact, it is not just Huangkuoka that is in short supply.
疫情发生后，拼多多接到了武汉、黄冈、天门、襄阳、荆门、孝感、宜昌等湖北七市急缺物资的求助。
After the outbreak of the epidemic, more than received Wuhan, Huanggang, Tianmen, Xiangyang, Jingmen, filial piety, Yichang and other urgent needs of materials in Hubei seven cities.
此后，拼多多向湖北七市16家医院捐赠了100万只外科医用口罩，20万双医用手套，30吨德国消毒液。
Since then, more than 1 million surgical masks, 200,000 pairs of medical gloves and 30 tons of German disinfectant have been donated to 16 hospitals in seven cities in Hubei Province.
而截至目前，拼多多已累计响应62家来自各地组织和机构的求助需求。
So far, more efforts have been made to respond to 62 organizations and agencies from all over the demand.
狄拉克说：“这些物资全部是拼多多采购，通过物流合作伙伴，直接送达援助对象。
"This is all a lot of shopping and is delivered directly to the target through our logistics partners," Dirac said.
这种点对点不通过第三方的捐助方式，在当前状态下效率较高，可以更快满足求助单位需要。
This peer-to-peer approach, which does not rely on third-party contributions, is more efficient in its current state and can meet the needs of help units more quickly.
”　　据了解，在医疗物资全国普遍紧缺的情况下，筹措物资只是第一个困难。
"It is understood that in the face of widespread shortages of medical supplies across the country, raising supplies is only the first difficulty.
狄拉克表示，疫区情势紧急、情况复杂，困难层出不穷。
Dirac said the situation in the epidemic area is urgent, complex and difficult.
“在救援前期，主要的困难是物资短缺，而现在物流也越来越困难，很多地方封了路，前线必须是有资质的运输公司才能进入。
"In the early stages of the rescue, the main difficulty was the shortage of supplies, but now logistics are becoming more and more difficult, many places are closed and the front line has to be accessible by qualified transport companies."
”他说。
'he said.
尽管困难重重，在物流合作伙伴支持下，拼多多尽最大努力，把筹措到的每一个医用口罩送抵最需要的医护人员手里。
Despite these difficulties, and with the support of logistics partners, every effort has been made to bring every medical mask that has been raised to the most needy medical personnel.
在此次抗疫中，拼多多的捐赠不仅限于医疗物资。
In the fight against the disease, hard-fought donations are not limited to medical supplies.
新京报记者了解到，拼多多还联合浙大共同设立1亿元“病毒感染性疾病防控基金”，这笔捐赠款项将专项用于支持病毒感染及呼吸道传染性疾病防治，特别是此次新冠肺炎疫情支援保障和科学研究。
The Beijing News has learned that Zhejiang University has also jointly set up a 100 million yuan "viral disease prevention and control fund," which will be used to support the prevention and treatment of viral infections and respiratory infections, especially the SARS epidemic support and scientific research.
▲2月3日，拼多多捐赠的6吨蔬菜水果运至湖北襄阳老河口市疾控中心。
February 3, more than donated 6 tons of vegetables and fruits to Hubei Xiangyang City CDC.
━━━━━一位农民卖了他的两吨洋葱王东（化名）是云南红河州建水县农民，春节前他计划着卖掉两吨紫皮洋葱，之后就可以准备种水稻了。
Once upon a time a farmer sold two tons of onion Wang Dong (alias), a farmer in Jianshui County, Honghezhou, Yunnan, who planned to sell two tons of purple onions before the Spring Festival, before which he would be ready to grow rice.
但他没有想到的是，数千里之外的湖北新冠肺炎疫情也能影响到他这个高原农民的生计。
But what he did not think was that the outbreak of Hubei New Crown Pneumonia thousands of miles away could also affect the livelihood of farmers in the plateau.
据统计，受新冠肺炎疫情影响，建水县100吨洋葱滞销，农民将为此损失200万元。
According to statistics, due to the new crown pneumonia epidemic, Jianshui County 100 tons of onions unsold, farmers will lose 2 million yuan.
一边是像王东一样的农民，他们辛苦种下的洋葱卖不掉；在另一边，由于农产品销路受损，且受到封路、物流不便等影响，城市里的居民遭遇了买菜难。
On one side are farmers like Wang Dong, who toil to sell onions; on the other hand, urban residents struggle to buy vegetables because of damaged markets for agricultural products, blocked roads and inconvenient logistics.
于是，在得到建水洋葱滞销农户焦虑的信息后，拼多多将建水洋葱纳入“抗疫农货”补贴扶持计划。
So, after getting the anxious information of Onion farmers in Jianshui, more efforts will be made to build water onion into the "anti-epidemic farm products" subsidy support program.
狄拉克表示，“很多农产区‘一手要抓生产，一手要抓防疫’，但因为销路受阻，不少农民积极性受挫，相关生产也受到了很大影响。
"Many agricultural areas are trying to concentrate on production while keeping epidemic prevention at the same time," Dirac said.
”自1月底以来，不断有农业专家和学者联系拼多多，希望能够共同解决特殊时期的农产品产销问题，将疫情对农业生产的冲击降至最低。
Since the end of January, experts in agriculture and scholars have been working together to resolve the agricultural production and marketing problems of the special period and to minimize the impact of the epidemic on agricultural production.
为保障特殊时期的农产品产销对接，自2月3日起，拼多多陆续推出了一系列中小规模农产品专项活动。
To ensure the production and marketing of agricultural products during the special period, a series of special activities for small and medium-sized agricultural products have been launched since February 3.
“这期间主要是做三件事情，一是协同平台的新农人做商品清单，梳理农产区尤其是贫困地区的农产品库存和质量状况，将亟须打通销路的农产品‘往前推’；二是请求各地政府和相关部门协调，对此类农产品开辟绿色通道；三是统筹顺丰、中国邮政等物流资源，确保新鲜的农产品能够直达消费者手中。
"This period is mainly to do three things, one is to work with new farmers of the platform to make commodity lists, comb the inventory and quality of agricultural products, especially in poor areas, and 'push forward' the urgently marketable agricultural products. Second, ask local governments and relevant departments to coordinate to open green corridors for such products.
”　　2月10日，拼多多正式上线“抗疫农货”专区，目前，该专区已覆盖全国近400个农产区包括230多个国家级贫困县近28万个商品。
On Feb. 10, Duo Duo officially went on line to fight epidemic agricultural commodities, which now covers nearly 400 agricultural areas nationwide, including nearly 280,000 commodities from more than 230 impoverished counties.
针对专区商品，拼多多设置了5亿元的专项商品补贴，同时，每单农产品快递还将享有2元的特殊物流补贴。
For the region's commodities, more than 500 million set up a special commodity subsidies, and, at the same time, each agricultural express will enjoy a special logistics subsidies of 2 yuan.
“受益于中国农业崛起的拼多多，在当前这个特殊时期，我们将尽力去帮助每一个农民，把他们的损失降到最小。
"We will try our best to help every farmer and to minimize their losses during this special period," he said.
”狄拉克表示。
