编者按：饶志雄是当代中国社会一个缩影。
Editor's Note: Raozhi Xiong is a miniature of contemporary Chinese society.
一个“80后”乡里娃，靠个人奋斗，成长为上海知名学府的学院党委副书记。
"After 80" Township Eva, relying on personal struggle, grew into a well-known Shanghai college party committee deputy secretary.
春运，携妻儿回老家过年。
Spring Festival travel home with his wife and children.
本是衣锦还乡，却遇重大疫情，遇到乡村治理的重大挑战。
Originally, Jinxiang Xiangxiang, but encountered a major epidemic, encountered a major challenge of rural governance.
来自大上海高校的饶书记，以党员志愿者的身份，自愿做一名“小班长”，在村委会和上级党委的领导下投入抗疫工作，值得点赞。
The Rao secretary from a university in Greater Shanghai, as a volunteer, volunteered to be a "small monitor" and put in the fight against the epidemic under the leadership of the village committee and the higher Party committee.
同时，饶老师的例子，更可以给人以启示——城市如何反哺乡村？特别是该如何在精神上、思想上反哺乡村……口述 |饶志雄整理 | 姜浩峰我是华东理工大学资源与环境工程学院党委副书记饶志雄。
At the same time, the example of Mr Rao is even more revealing - how cities feed back to the countryside? In particular, how to feed the country spiritually and intellectually...
我的老家在湖北省咸宁市崇阳县白霓镇金星村第十组。
My hometown is in Hubei province Chongyang county Baineon Village Group 10.
我们金星村是县里疫情较为严重的地方。
Our village of Venus is a place with a serious epidemic in the county.
我们全村10个村民小组、715户、2748人，早期发现新冠肺炎确诊病例3人。
We have 10 village groups, 715 families, 2,748 people, early detection of the confirmed cases of New Crown Pneumonia 3.
今年1月18日，我带着太太和孩子，自驾车从上海回老家过年。
On January 18 this year, I drove home from Shanghai to celebrate the New Year with my wife and children.
在离开上海前，我已经听说武汉有不明原因肺炎，所以我开车走杭瑞高速，经过江西，没有经过武汉，开了11小时车，就回到了咸宁老家。
Before I left Shanghai, I had heard that Wuhan had pneumonia for unknown reasons, so I drove along the Hangzhou Express, passed through Jiangxi, and drove 11 hours without passing Wuhan, then returned to my hometown of Xianning.
回到村里，第一时间我们在村里做了报备——从上海回家，没去过武汉。
Back in the village, the first time we made a report in the village - from Shanghai home, not to Wuhan.
到家以后没几天，听说武汉封城了。
A few days after I got home, I heard that Wuhan was closed.
我们咸宁管控也开始严厉起来。
Our Xianning controls have also begun to tighten.
我接到了村两委和驻村工作队的通知，说要召集党员、退休干部等志愿者，针对农村居住较为分散的实际，按照村民居住地段和亲疏关系，采取约十户为一组、一组一个联防长和N个志愿者的方式，在全村共划定联防区48个。
I was informed by the village committee and the village task force that volunteers, such as Party members and retired cadres, would be called in to demarcate 48 JACs in the village, in groups of about 10 households and in groups of one chief prevention officer and N volunteers, in accordance with the scattered nature of rural residence and family relations.
我马上主动报名参与。
I'll sign up right away.
饶志雄（左）在家门口参与家乡抗疫工作村委会派我三个活——一是看守一条已封闭的道路，防止村内外人员翻越。
Rao Zhixiong (left) in front of the home to participate in the work of the village committee against the epidemic sent me three live - one is to guard a closed road, to prevent people inside and outside the village from overturning.
我负责的就是距离我家最近的那条路。
I'm in charge of the nearest road to my home.
二是佩戴“党员先锋、决战决胜”袖章，跟随其他工作人员在村里巡逻，并进行政策宣传，对在规定地方未戴口罩、聚集聊天、打麻将打牌等不当行为进行劝阻。
The other is to wear the armband "Party Pioneer, Final Win," patrol the village with other staff and carry out policy advocacy to discourage inappropriate behaviour such as wearing masks, gathering and chatting, playing Mahjong and playing cards in prescribed places.
在具体工作中，我们发现有人聚众打麻将的话，会劝阻，并要求他们第二天和我们一起到村里参与“反面”教育工作，在我们巡逻的过程中，这些人敲锣打鼓告诉大家不可以打麻将。
In the course of our patrols, we found that people who gathered to play Mahjong discouraged them and asked them to join us the next day in the "negative" education work in the village.
在具体的工作中，也有人家不满，对我们态度恶劣。
In the concrete work, also has the family discontented, treats us badly.
遇到矛盾我们就报警，或者到派出所处理。
We call the police in case of contradiction, or deal with it at the police station.
三是担任村里11户人家的十联户联防长。
Third, as the village of 11 households Union Chief.
我觉得这项工作，在乡间抗疫工作中，显得特别重要。
I think this work is particularly important in the fight against epidemics in the countryside.
我要做到向大家宣传、督促疫情防控相关要求，关心11户家庭的生活情况，及时向村里负责采购的工作人员汇报情况。
I will do my best to publicize and urge the prevention and control of epidemic diseases, care for the living conditions of 11 families, and report to the village purchasing staff in time.
饶志雄（右）参与联防联控在抗疫期间，“咸宁发布”报道了我们村的情况，这样写道——每个联防组设立一个联防长，并建立一个微信群。
Raozhi xiong (right) participated in the joint control During the fight against the epidemic, Xianning issued a report on our village, which reads: Each Joint Prevention Unit has a liaison officer and a micro-group.
联防长和志愿者由该村的党员、大学教授、退伍军人、企业家、乡贤、村组干部等有威望、有能力、有责任心的人担任。
The Chief Inspector and the volunteers are members of the village, university professors, veterans, entrepreneurs, villagers, cadres and other respected, competent and responsible persons.
我们村现在采取统一采购的模式，各家把生活所需购买物品清单给村里，村里派出指定的采购人员到附近的镇上采买。
Our village now adopts the uniform procurement model, each family needs to purchase the list of items to the village, the village sent designated procurement staff to the nearby town to buy.
主要是蔬菜、粮油、药品、奶粉、煤气等物品。
Mainly vegetables, grain and oil, medicine, milk powder, gas and other items.
我们金星村距离县城有八公里，一般采买物品就到附近的白霓镇。
Our village Venus is eight kilometres from the county seat, and generally buys things to go to the nearby town of Moneypenny.
总的看，在抗疫期间，村民在家的物质生活没什么问题。
In general, the villagers' material life at home was no problem during the fight against the disease.
不过我也注意到村里有人生活还是比较困难的。
But I also noticed how difficult it was for people in the village to live.
比如我家附近有户人家，一个快五十岁的女同志，老公死了，她的小孩在外打工，几年不跟她联系。
For example, there is a family near my home, a nearly 50-year-old lesbian, her husband died, her children work outside, do not contact her for several years.
而她本人身体也不好。
And she herself is not in good health.
由此我就注意到村里确实还有一些人，和她类似，在物质生活和精神生活上都有困难，特别是一些老人，更困难。
From this I noticed that there were indeed some people in the village who, like her, had difficulties in their material and spiritual lives, especially the elderly.
我们金星村是个大行政村。
Our village Venus is a big administrative village.
我家在第十组。
My family is in Group Ten.
我没机会跑遍所有组，于是掏了2000块钱给村里，请村里代为采买一些米啊、食用油啊什么的，资助村里有困难的人家过年。
I didn't have a chance to run through all the groups, so I paid 2000 yuan to the village and asked the village to buy some rice, cooking oil and so on.
我们学院的书记修光利听说后，也给我微信转了2000元，让我捐给困难的乡亲。
When Huo Guangli, the secretary of our college, heard about it, he gave me 2000 yuan to donate it to my countrymen in need.
这样，我们一共捐了4000元。
In this way, we donated 4000 yuan.
饶志雄将华理心理咨询中心老师徐玉兰拉到家乡心理疏导群村民精神生活上的困难怎么解决呢？一次，我们这里的镇长来到村委会，看到我正在和大家一起开展工作，知道我是在上海的华东理工大学工作，就跟我说：“饶老师，你看我们现在抗疫期间，大家都宅在家里，有些村民确实可能存在心理焦虑。
Rao Zhixiong Huali psychological counseling center teacher Xu Yulan to his hometown on how to solve the psychological difficulties of villagers living? Once, our mayor came to the village committee and saw me working with all of you, knowing that I was working for the East China Polytechnic University in Shanghai.
我们镇的疫情防控群里有各个村村干部，也有一些妇委会主任啥的在群里。
In our town, there are village cadres in the epidemic prevention and control group, as well as some women's committee directors in the group.
你看是不是能请专业老师帮帮我们？”我一听，确实和我了解到的村民需求应和了，于是我把我们华东理工大学心理咨询中心徐玉兰老师拉入我们镇防疫期间心理疏导群。
Do you think we can get professional teachers to help us? "I listened, and I did understand that the needs of the villagers match, so I took our East China Polytechnic University counseling center Xu Yulan teachers into our town during the epidemic prevention group.
徐老师进群，获得了我老家村干部们的大力欢迎。
Xu got a warm welcome from the village cadres in my hometown.
我觉得，这是送一门新的知识下乡啊！饶志雄录的微课截屏在老家过这么一个寒假，确实特别。
I think this is to send a new knowledge to the countryside ah! Raozhi XiongRao micro-class screenshots in the home of such a winter vacation, really special.
在金星村我家里没装宽带。
I don't have broadband in my house in Venus.
但我还是得上网啊。
But I still have to surf the internet.
现在学校提倡任课教师录课，3月开展网络教学，学校安排我录制一节“战疫有我，为心导航”辅导员系列微课程，提升全体辅导员在疫情防控期间的战“疫”能力，更好地服务学生。
Now teachers are encouraged to record lessons, in March the network teaching, the school arranged me to record a "plague I, for the heart navigation" counselor series of micro-courses, to enhance the ability of all counsellors during the epidemic prevention and control of the "epidemic" to better serve students.
在老家期间，我还得和其他老师交流，和同学交流。
During my hometown, I had to communicate with other teachers and with my classmates.
作为学院学生工作负责人，我还必须迅速按照学校统一部署建立辅导员-班委-学生小组三级联动的网络化管理反馈机制，每日进行全院1223名学生的健康报送。
As the head of the college's student work, I must also promptly establish a network management feedback mechanism for the three levels of tutors-class committee-student groups in accordance with the unified deployment of schools, and carry out daily health reports for 1,223 students.
好在我的手机流量充足，没有宽带也不影响工作开展。
Fortunately, my mobile phone flow is sufficient, no broadband does not affect the work to carry out.
平平安安群不得不说，新冠肺炎疫情突如其来、态势凶猛。
PingAn group has to say that the outbreak of new crown pneumonia sudden, fierce situation.
目前，我们华东理工大学资源与环境工程学院共有40名师生暂留湖北省。
At present, our School of Resource and Environmental Engineering of East China Polytechnic University has 40 students and teachers staying in Hubei province.
我想，我们暂留湖北的，可能会是全国最后回到上海的那批人。
I think our stay in Hubei will probably be the last group in China to return to Shanghai.
在武汉封城，也是我们回到湖北以后，我第一时间将身处湖北的同学拉入一个微信群，一个qq群，分类指导，并取群名为“平平安安”，鼓励大家不焦虑、不恐慌、不信谣、不传谣，共同为武汉加油，为湖北加油，为中国加油！我还对重点学生进行“键对键”关怀，通过私聊的方式安抚他们的心理。
In Wuhan, also after we returned to Hubei, I will be the first students in Hubei pulled into a micro-group, a qq group, classification guidance, and group named "PingAn," to encourage people not anxious, do not panic, non-believe, do not spread rumors, together refueling Wuhan, Hubei refueling, for China!
临时党支部在行动我们学院暂留湖北的师生还成立了临时党支部。
Temporary Party Branch in Action Our college has set up a temporary Party branch for teachers and students in Hubei Province.
党支部在线上开展党课学习；临时党支部的党员在自己所在的地市，在线下身体力行参与疫情防护工作，贴心录制健康防控宣传口号，并结合学校开展的“空中”主题班会活动，在各自所在的“云”班会中分享心得感悟，送上假期学习加油包，将乐观的精神与必胜的信念进行传递。
Members of the temporary Party branches take part in the prevention and control of the epidemic online in their own cities, record health prevention and control propaganda slogans, and share their experience in their "Cloud" classes.
华理资环学院学生党员参加家乡抗疫工作我是1996年中考考上了咸宁市的高中，这才离开乡村的。
I was admitted to Xianning City High School in mid-1996 and left the country.
1999年我考到华东理工大学。
I was admitted to East China Polytechnic University in 1999.
当时从武汉坐火车到上海，整整17个小时。
It was 17 hours from Wuhan to Shanghai by train.
现在武汉到上海高铁只要四个多小时。
Wuhan to Shanghai high-speed railway only in more than four hours.
2003年我本科毕业，当时上海有个本科生三加二保研政策，就是本科毕业留校当两年辅导员，可以保研。
I graduated from undergraduate course in 2003, when Shanghai had an undergraduate policy of three plus two insurance research, is to stay as a two-year tutor, can protect research.
之后，2008年我研究生毕业，继续在学校工作。
Then, in 2008, I graduated as a graduate student and continued to work in my school.
我的太太也是湖北人，但不是我们咸宁的。
My wife is from Hubei too, but not from Xianning.
这次过年，我们一起回我老家。
This New Year, we go back to my hometown together.
我们家大娃9岁，二娃13个月大。
Our eldest child is 9 years old and our second child is 13 months old.
现在面临着的一个问题是——上小学三年级的大娃接下来该怎么办？现在上海推出中小学“网上开学”，还是挺及时的，我们可以用手机流量看到。
One of the problems we face now is what to do next for the third-graders of elementary and secondary schools in Shanghai, where we can see the flow of mobile phones.
