当地时间2月29日，美国华盛顿州西雅图市国王县卫生官员报告称，一名50多岁的男性新冠肺炎患者当天在当地一家医院死亡。
A 50-year-old man suffering from pneumonia died in a local hospital in Seattle, Washington, on Feb. 29, local time, health officials said.
这是美国首例新冠肺炎患者死亡该病例，就死者感染路径，美国疾控中心国家免疫和呼吸系统疾病主任梅索尼尔（Nancy Messonnier）指出，目前还无法证实。
This is the first case of death from pneumonia in the United States, and Nancy Messonnier, director of national immunization and respiratory disease at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, points out that it is not yet possible to confirm the route of infection.
据报道，这名死亡患者此前没有相关旅行史，也没有接触过已知感染源。
The death was reported to have had no previous travel history or contact with a known source of infection.
华盛顿州长英斯利宣布，该州进入紧急状态并表示该州政府各机构将动用“所有必要的资源”，为新冠疫情的暴发做好准备，并授权在必要时动用华盛顿州的国民警卫队。
Washington Governor John Insley declared a state of emergency and said state agencies would use "all necessary resources" to prepare for an outbreak of the New Crown, and authorized the use of the Washington state National Guard if necessary.
除了该死亡病例之外，华盛顿州新增4例核酸检测为阳性的病例，其中2例为该州国王县柯克兰市同一个护理中心的医护人员和患者。
In addition to the death, there were four new nucleic acid-positive cases in Washington state, two of which were medical staff and patients at the same care center in Kirkland, King's County.
这名医护人员40多岁，目前情况稳定，而70多岁的患者病情严重。
The paramedics, who are in their 40s, are in stable condition, while patients in their 70s are seriously ill.
据美国媒体报道，另外2例分别为一名感染源不明的高中生，以及一名去过韩国大邱旅行的50多岁女性。
The other two cases were an unidentified high school student and a 50-year-old woman who had been to Taegu, South Korea, US media reported.
截至目前，美国本土共确诊22例新冠肺炎病例，从中国武汉撤侨的人员中确诊3例，从日本“钻石公主”号邮轮撤侨的人员中确诊44例，美国新冠肺炎患者总数增至69人。
So far, 22 cases of New Crown Pneumonia have been confirmed in the United States, 3 cases have been confirmed among those evacuated from Wuhan, China, 44 cases have been confirmed from the Japanese vessel Princess Diamond, and the total number of cases of pneumonia in the United States has increased to 69.
在报告首例死亡病例后，美国总统特朗普在白宫召开新闻发布会，称美国将发布更多的旅行禁令，以阻止新冠病毒的进一步传播。
Following the first reported death, US President Trump held a press conference at the White House, saying the United States would issue more travel bans to stop the further spread of the virus.
此外，他将与制药机构负责人探讨研制新冠病毒疫苗。
In addition, he will discuss the development of a new crown virus vaccine with heads of pharmaceutical companies.
不过特朗普强调，美国公众无需恐慌，对于普通美国人民而言新冠病毒带来的风险依然很低。
Trump has stressed, however, that the American public need not panic, and that the risk posed by the new crown virus remains low for ordinary Americans.
另据央视新闻报道，特朗普还积极评价了中国政府高效遏制新冠肺炎疫情，并寻求合作。
Separately, according to CCTV news reports, Trump has also commented positively on the Chinese government's efforts to effectively contain the outbreak of pneumonia in the New Crown.
美专家：美国疫情扩散风险增大据环球时报援引美媒报道，美国迄今已发现4起感染源头不明的新型冠状病毒确诊病例。
US expert: The United States has identified four new cases of coronavirus with an unknown source, the Global Times quoted the US media as saying.
此前，加州圣克拉拉县公共卫生部门主任萨拉·科迪在通报当地出现的未知来源病例时表示，“这一新病例是正在出现社区传播的证据，但程度尚不清楚……我知道这个消息可能令人担忧，但我们一直在为此做准备。
Earlier, Sara Cody, director of public health in Santa Clara County, Calif., who reported an unknown source of local cases, said: "The new case is evidence of emerging community transmission, but the extent is unclear... I know the news may be worrying, but we've been preparing for it.
现在，我们需要开始采取其他行动，以减慢病毒的传播速度。
Now we need to start doing something else to slow down the spread of the virus.
”不过，美国兰德公司亚太政策研究中心流行病学家黄志环表示，美国出现多例社区传播病例已证明单纯依靠旅行禁令不可能完全阻止病毒传播。
But Huang Zhihuan, an epidemiologist at the RAND Corporation's Asia-Pacific Policy Research Center, says the number of cases of community transmission in the US has proven that a travel ban alone cannot stop the virus from spreading.
她建议，在已有本地传播的情况下，美国此刻应把关注的重点放在医院是否有足够容量接纳病人、检测试剂是否足量，以及加快培训医护人员，提高其筛查鉴别可疑症状的能力。
She suggested that, where local transmission already existed, the United States should now focus on whether hospitals had sufficient capacity to receive patients, test the adequacy of reagents and speed up the training of health-care personnel to detect suspicious symptoms.
“目前，医护识别新冠病毒感染的培训已在美国开始一段时间，各州的卫生局也都已有所准备”，黄志环称，美国疾控中心也已更新其检测标准，不再将有中国旅行史作为可以接受检测的要求之一。
"Health care training to recognize new crown infections has been in place for some time now, and state health boards are getting ready," says Huang, who said the CDC has updated its test criteria to eliminate the need for a Chinese travel history as an acceptable test.
不过，还有更多事项需要着手去做。
However, more needs to be done.
“比如是否采用定点医院的形式，医院容量不足的情况下轻症病人应该如何隔离，怎样安全运输确诊者，都已成为美国现在需要立即考虑并准备的事情。
"For example, whether to use the form of a designated hospital, how to isolate patients with mild illness due to inadequate hospital capacity, and how to safely transport confirmed patients have become a matter of urgent consideration and preparation in the United States.
”她这样表示。
'she said.
另据CNN报道，社区传播让美国的核酸检测能力遭遇巨大挑战。
Community communication poses a huge challenge to America's ability to detect nucleic acids, CNN reported.
美国疾控中心免疫和呼吸系统疾病中心主任南希·梅森尼尔28日承认，最初发送给州和地方实验室的某些检测工具包存在缺陷，降低了各地对新冠病毒的检测能力。
Nancy Mason Neal, director of the Centers for Disease Control's Centers for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, admitted Wednesday that some of the test kits originally sent to state and local laboratories were flawed, reducing local capacity to detect the new crown virus.
除疾病控制与预防中心以外，只有少数实验室可以执行测试。
With the exception of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only a few laboratories can perform tests.
此前，加州州长加文·纽瑟姆曾公开抱怨称，加州仅有几百个检测工具包，根本不足以应对目前出现的问题。
Earlier, California Governor Gavin Neutham had publicly complained that California had only a few hundred test kits, not enough to cope with the problems that were emerging.
在这种情况下，美国目前已将提升各地核酸检测能力作为主要工作之一。
In this context, the United States has so far upgraded nucleic acid detection capacity everywhere as one of the main tasks.
美国卫生部长亚历克斯·阿扎尔表示，到本周末预计全国将有93个实验室具有测试能力。
Alex Azar, US health secretary, said that by the end of the week, 93 laboratories nationwide were expected to have test capacity.
“美国已正式开考。
"The United States has officially taken the test.
”耶鲁大学全球健康政策与经济学助理教授陈希这样形容称，目前美国风险最高的地方是大城市。
Chen Xi, assistant professor of global health policy and economics at Yale University, described the riskiest places in the country right now as the big cities.
因为大城市有大量无医疗保险的人群，而广大的乡村地区反而风险较小。
Because large cities have large uninsured populations, the vast rural areas are less at risk.
休斯顿N95口罩大幅涨价尽管特朗普一直对疫情轻描淡写，美国疾控中心也建议公众无需佩戴口罩，但美国民众似乎对此并不买账。
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Even though Trump has played down the epidemic and the CDC has advised the public not to wear masks, Americans do not seem to be buying it.
据CNN报道，美国已有许多人排队抢购口罩等物资，原本售价8美元一包的100个装4533防尘口罩在有些地方已经卖到了200美元一包。
Already, many Americans are lining up to snag supplies such as masks, and 100 4533 face masks, originally priced at $8 a bag, have sold for $200 in some places, CNN reported.
据报道，为解决高度紧缺的口罩需求，特朗普政府正考虑动用《国防生产法案》，推动国内口罩、防护服等抗疫物资产能迅速扩大。
To address the high demand for masks, the Trump administration is reportedly considering using the Defense Production Act to boost production capacity for epidemic-resistant materials such as domestic masks and protective clothing.
该法律是1950年朝鲜战争爆发时期美国国会通过的法律。
The law was passed by the United States Congress during the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950.
该法律赋予美国总统权力，以国家安全等原因扩大关键材料或产品的生产。
The law gives the president of the United States the power to expand the production of key materials or products, including for reasons of national security.
报道援引官员的话指出，目前美国防护物资供应不足。
Officials were quoted as saying there was a shortage of U. S. defense supplies.
动用该法律是美国政府正在考虑的多种选择之一。
The use of the law is one of many options being considered by the United States Government.
本周二，美国卫生和公共服务部（HHS)部长亚历克斯·阿扎尔在国会听证时表示，目前国内N95口罩的战略储备为3000万，但美国医护人员需求高达3亿枚。
Alex Azar, secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, told a congressional hearing on Tuesday that while the nation's strategic stockpile of N95 masks is 30 million, U.S. health workers need 300 million.
同一天，美国疾病控制与预防中心（CDC）下属国家免疫和呼吸系统疾病中心主任南希·梅森尼尔表示，随着越来越多国家/地区发生社区传播，遏制病毒在美国境内传播变得越来越困难。
On the same day, Nancy Mason Neal, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, said it was becoming increasingly difficult to contain the spread of the virus within the United States as more and more countries / regions experienced community transmission.
“这不是会不会发生的问题，而是何时会发生的问题。
"It's not a question of whether, but when.
” 梅森尼尔说。
"said Mason Neill.
耶鲁大学全球健康政策与经济学助理教授陈希表示，美国疾控中心对于口罩的指导不应“一刀切”。
Chen Xi, assistant professor of global health policy and economics at Yale University, said the CDC's guidance on masks should not be "one size fits all."
目前情况下，在纽约、华盛顿等人口密度大的城市，市民应该佩戴口罩。
Under current circumstances, people in densely populated cities such as New York and Washington should wear masks.
他同时表示，由于美国大部分的口罩依赖于从中国进口，疫情导致大量贸易中断，未来美国或将面对较严重的医疗物资短缺。
He also said the United States may face a severe shortage of medical supplies in the future as most of its masks rely on imports from China and the outbreak has led to a massive disruption of trade.
陈希还表示，目前美国公共卫生学界正式计划联合向白宫与特朗普总统提出政策建议，但目前在公共卫生界较有争议的是部分地区是否有必要关闭学校，对于这一问题卫生界专家尚未达成共识。
Chen also said there are now official plans in the US public health community to jointly advise the White House and President Trump on policies, but that the need to close schools in some areas is now more controversial in the public health community, an issue on which there is no consensus among health experts.
