澎湃新闻记者 张唯了解危重症患者的临床特征对于降低新型冠状病毒肺炎的死亡率至关重要。
Zhang Wei, a Peng Pai journalist, understood the clinical characteristics of critically ill patients in order to reduce the mortality rate of the new coronavirus pneumonia.
当地时间2月24日，华中科技大学同济医学院、武汉市金银潭医院、武汉大学人民医院等机构在《柳叶刀呼吸医学》(The Lancet Respiratory Medicine)发表了一项针对52名危重症患者的回顾性研究。
A retrospective study of 52 critically ill patients was published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine by the Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, the Gold and Silver Tam Hospital in Wuhan City and the People's Hospital of Wuhan University on February 24, 2007.
研究显示，年龄大于65岁且患有基础疾病和急性呼吸窘迫综合征的老年患者有更高的死亡风险。
Studies have shown that older people over the age of 65 with basic illnesses and acute respiratory distress syndrome have a higher risk of death.
研究涉及的52名危重症患者患者中，32名（61.5%）在入住重症监护室（ICU）后28天内死亡。
Of the 52 critically ill patients studied, 32 (61.5%) died within 28 days of admission to ICU.
死亡患者从入住ICU到死亡的平均时间为7天。
The average time between admission to ICU and death for a deceased patient was 7 days.
研究还指出，有脑血管病史的患者若感染新型冠状病毒，会有更高的病危或死亡风险。
The study also pointed out that patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease, if infected with a new coronavirus, will have a higher risk of disease or death.
上述研究题为《中国武汉新型冠状病毒肺炎危重患者的临床病程与结果：一项单中心回顾性观察研究》（Clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan,China: a single centered,retrospective,observational study）。

The author also includes Shu Huaxing, Liu Hong, Zou Xiaojing, Yuan Shiying and Yu Zhuan, Deputy Director of Severe Medicine, People's Hospital of Wuhan University.
研究在武汉金银潭医院完成，除该院感染的医护人员外，所有病人均从其他医院转院而来。
The study was carried out at the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital in Wuhan. All patients were transferred from other hospitals except the hospital's infected medical staff.
根据世界卫生组织的临时指南，研究人员对2019年12月24日至2020年1月26日期间被确诊为新冠肺炎且属于危重症的患者进行了回顾性分析。
In accordance with the provisional guidelines of the World Health Organization, the researchers conducted a retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed as critically ill from 24 December 2019 to 26 January 2020.
危重症患者被定义为入住重症监护病房（ICU）且需要机械通气或吸入气中的氧浓度分数（FiO2）超过60%的患者。
Critical patients are defined as patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and requiring mechanical ventilation or oxygen concentration in inhaled gas (FiO2) exceeding 60%.
研究人员分析了这段时间内，院内所有经实验室确诊的新冠病毒感染患者的临床电子病历、护理记录、实验室检查结果、放射学检查和入院数据。
The researchers analyzed clinical electronic medical records, nursing records, laboratory results, radiological examinations and admission data for all laboratory-confirmed cases of HCV infection in the hospital during this period.
研究人员在2020年2月9日重新确认了患者的生存状态。
The researchers confirmed the patient's survival on February 9, 2020.
图1：研究流程图多数危重症患者出现器官功能受损论文显示，截至2020年1月26日，武汉金银谭医院共收治确诊新型冠状病毒肺炎710例，658例（93%）被认为不符合研究要求，3例患者入院后立即发生心脏骤停。
As of January 26, 2020, 710 new cases of coronavirus pneumonia had been admitted to Wuhan Gold and Silver Tan Hospital, 658 cases (93%) were found not to meet the research requirements.
最终有52名（7%）危重症患者被纳入本研究。
In the end, 52 (7%) critically ill patients were included in the study.
52名危重症患者均为武汉市居民，从其他医院转院至金银潭医院。
All 52 critically ill patients were residents of Wuhan city who were transferred from other hospitals to Gold and Silver Pool Hospital.
平均年龄为59.7岁，27人（52%）大于60岁，男性患者35例（67%）。

图2：重症新冠肺炎患者的特征统计，含年龄、性别、暴露史、慢性疾病等上述患者中，最常见的症状是发热（98%）、咳嗽（77%）和呼吸困难（63.5%）。
Figure 2: Statistics on the characteristics of patients with severe crown pneumonia, including age, sex, history of exposure, chronic diseases, fever (98 per cent), cough (77 per cent) and breathing difficulties (63.5 per cent) were the most common symptoms.
其中6位患者（11%）在出现与新冠病毒感染有关的症状后2至8天才开始发热。
Six of the patients (11 per cent) developed fever two to eight days after developing symptoms associated with a new crown virus infection.

Eighteen patients (35 per cent) were treated with oseltamivir, 14 (27 per cent) with ganciclovir and 7 (13.5 per cent) with Lopinavir.
图4：新型冠状病毒肺炎危重患者的存活率在52名危重症患者中，32名（61.5%）在入住ICU后28天内死亡，从入住ICU到死亡的中位时间为7天。
Fig. 4: Of the 52 critically ill patients with the new coronavirus pneumonia, 32 (61.5%) died within 28 days of admission to the ICU, and the median time between admission to ICU and death was 7 days.
与生存患者相比，死亡患者生前更容易出现急性呼吸窘迫综合征，更可能接受机械通气。
Compared with the survival patients, the death patients were more likely to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, more likely to accept mechanical ventilation.
37例（81%）接受机械通气的患者在28天内去世。
Thirty-seven patients (81 per cent) received mechanical ventilation and died within 28 days.
与生存患者相比，死亡患者平均年龄更大（64.6岁比51.9岁），更有可能同时患有慢性疾病（53%比20%）。
Deaths have a higher average age (64.6 years compared to 51.9 years) and are more likely to suffer from chronic diseases (53 per cent compared to 20 per cent) than survivors.
在20名生存患者中，有8名患者已经出院。
Eight of the 20 surviving patients have been discharged from the hospital.
三名患者在28天时仍在进行有创通气，一名患者在进行ECMO。
Three patients were still undergoing invasive ventilation at 28 days and one patient was undergoing ECMO.
1例采用无创通气，2例采用高流量鼻导管，6例采用普通鼻导管。
Non-invasive ventilation was used in 1 case, high flow nasal catheter was used in 2 cases and ordinary nasal catheter was used in 6 cases.
论文讨论环节指出，这是首份描述新型冠状病毒肺炎危重患者特征的研究。
The discussion session indicated that this was the first study to describe the characteristics of the new coronavirus pneumonia patients.
在之前发表的三项针对重症患者的研究中，患者数量太少，无法总结患者特征和死亡率。
In three previous studies of critically ill patients, the number of patients was too small to summarize patient characteristics and mortality.
论文作者表示，病毒性重症肺炎的病理基础是急性呼吸窘迫综合征（ARDS），而男性和老年人（65岁以上）比女性或年轻人更容易发生ARDS。
The authors suggest that the pathological basis for severe viral pneumonia is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is more common among men and older people (65 years and older) than among women or young people.
因此，新冠病毒肺炎危重症患者28天的死亡率接近于严重ARDS的死亡率（50%）是合理的。
It is therefore reasonable that the 28-day mortality rate in critically ill patients with HCV pneumonia is close to the mortality rate for severe ARDS (50 per cent).
他们认为，随着临床治疗能力的提高，预计新冠肺炎危重症患者的死亡率将下降。
They said the death rate in critically ill patients with new crown pneumonia is expected to decline as clinical treatment capacity improves.
此外，作者强调，发热是新冠病毒肺炎患者最常见的症状，但并非所有患者都有发热现象。
In addition, the authors stress that fever is the most common symptom in patients with Newcastle virus pneumonia, but not all patients have fever.
研究中，6名患者在发病时未出现发热（11.5%），在2至8天后才见发热症状。
In the study, 6 patients had no fever at the time of onset (11.5%) and had fever symptoms after 2-8 days.
发热症状的延迟阻碍了新型冠状病毒感染患者的早期识别。
The delay of fever symptom hindered the early identification of patients with new coronavirus infection.
论文总结称，新型冠状病毒肺炎危重症患者的死亡率高。
The paper concludes that the mortality rate of the new coronavirus pneumonia patients is high.
年龄大于65岁且患有基础疾病和急性呼吸窘迫综合征的老年患者死亡风险增加。
The risk of death increases among older persons over 65 years of age who suffer from basic diseases and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
