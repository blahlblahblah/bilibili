国内外的口罩都在送往武汉，可武汉医院的不仅缺口罩，甚至即将用完。
Both domestic and foreign masks are being sent to Wuhan, but Wuhan hospital not only gap cover, or even about to use up.
人民日报在其官微发问：究竟是物资紧缺还是物资分配环节存在问题？截止到目前，协和医院收到的物资全部来自企业和个人捐赠。
People's Daily in its official micro-asked whether there is a shortage of supplies or material distribution links? So far, Concorde Hospital has received all the materials from enterprises and individual donations.
物资直接对接到各地疫情指挥部或是各家医院，是最有效的本文首发于南方人物周刊文| 本刊记者杨楠 孟依依    实习记者 何沛芸 聂阳欣编辑|蒯乐昊 周建平全文约3216字，细读大约需要8分钟图/读者提供华中科技大学同济医学院附属协和医院（以下简称协和医院）一直在求助。
This article is the most effective for people from all over the country. It is the most effective article ever written by our correspondent Yang Nan-Meng Yi, a trainee journalist. Quine Le Hao Zhou Jianping's full text takes about 3 216 words. It takes about 8 minutes for readers to read the full text.
从1月23日至今，以协和医院或是医生个人名义的募集函此起彼伏出现在朋友圈、微信、豆瓣和学习强国等各种民间、官方网站。
From January 23 to the present, letters of collection in the name of Concorde Hospital or individual doctors have appeared on a variety of popular and official websites, including friendship circles, micro-letters, peas and learning powers.
协和同另外近二十家医院直接发出接受捐赠社会公告的当天，湖北省长在接受中央电视台采访时称“物资储备充足”。
In an interview with state broadcaster China Central Television on the same day that Concorde and nearly 20 other hospitals directly accepted the announcement, Hubei provincial governor said the stock was sufficient.
疫情爆发以来，全国各地的医疗防护装备驰援湖北。
Since the outbreak of the outbreak, medical protection equipment across the country to help Hubei.
在过去八天里，在海内外华人的努力下，我国共进口5622.8万个口罩，73.8万件防护服，主要都送往湖北，并优先送抵武汉。
In the past eight days, thanks to the efforts of the Chinese people at home and abroad, 56.228 million masks and 738,000 protective clothing were imported, mainly sent to Hubei Province, with priority given to Wuhan.
国内外的口罩都在送往武汉，可武汉医院的不仅缺口罩，甚至即将用完。
Both domestic and foreign masks are being sent to Wuhan, but Wuhan hospital not only gap cover, or even about to use up.
人民日报在其官微发问：究竟是物资紧缺还是物资分配环节存在问题？1月29日，协和医院向社会募集防护服3000件、医用N95口罩5000个、医用外科口罩8000个、一次性隔离衣3000件、防护面罩1000个。
On January 29, Concorde Hospital collected 3,000 protective suits, 5,000 medical N95 masks, 8,000 medical surgical masks, 3,000 disposable protective clothing and 1,000 face masks from the general public.
隔日，微博身份认证为协和医院神经外科医生的“协和医院Do先生”，发布微博称：医院物资“不是告急，是没有了”。
The next day, Weibo identity certified as Concorde Hospital neurosurgeon "Mr. Do Concorde Hospital" issued Weibo said: "hospital supplies are either urgent or no."
负责协和医院物资统筹的刘欣告诉南方人物周刊，1月30日，协和的物资储备最多只能支撑一天半。
Liu Xin, who is in charge of coordinating supplies at the Concorde hospital, told People's Weekend that on January 30, Concorde's stock would last only a day and a half at most.
大部分科室的物资都无法覆盖，“一件都拿不出来了，只能硬上。
Most departments of the material can not cover, "one can not be taken out, can only be hard.
”刘欣说。
'said Liu.
目前，协和医院派出了五百名医护人员奋战在疫情一线，每日需要消耗数千口罩。
At present, Concorde hospital dispatched 500 medical personnel to fight in the frontline of the epidemic, daily need to consume thousands of masks.
而原本应该四小时更换的防护服，基本医护人员穿上就不敢脱。
And should be replaced by four hours of protective clothing, the basic health-care personnel dare not take off.
防护服的胶是一次性的，一旦脱下，就不能再次使用。
The adhesive of protective clothing is disposable, once take off, cannot be used again.
“尽量不喝水，大家都穿成人纸尿裤，不去上厕所，就不用脱下（防护服）”，一位协和的护士告诉我们。
"Try not to drink water, we all wear adult diapers, do not go to the toilet, do not have to take off [protective clothing]," a Concorde nurse told us.
然而，失望的是，在武汉市红十字会最新公布的发放物资一览表中，作为新冠肺炎定点发热门诊机构，武汉最大的三甲医院之一的协和医院并不在其中。
Disappointed, however, is that Concorde Hospital, one of Wuhan's largest triple-A hospitals, is not among the newly released lists of materials distributed by the Wuhan Red Cross.
一位昨日前去武汉国博领取红十字会物资的协和医生告诉我们，不知何故，他们空手而返。
A Concorde doctor who went to Wuhan yesterday to collect Red Cross supplies told us that somehow they returned empty-handed.
他们试图与武汉红十字会交涉两个小时，不但没有领到任何物资，甚至遭遇了强制卸货。
They tried to negotiate with Wuhan Red Cross Society for two hours, not only did not receive any supplies, even encountered forced unloading.
另一个历史细节现在罕有人提起：武汉曾是中国红十字会的发源地。
Another historical detail is rarely mentioned: Wuhan was once the birthplace of the Chinese Red Cross.
1938年，武汉成为抗战中心，中国红十字会救护总队在汉口成立，协和医院的首位华人系主任林可胜担任总队长。
In 1938, Wuhan became the Anti-Japanese War Center, the Chinese Red Cross Ambulance General Team was founded in Hankou, and Lin KeSheng, the first Chinese dean of Concorde Hospital, was the chief captain.
那一年，武汉的红十字会与中国人民在战火中共进退。
That year, Wuhan Red Cross and the Chinese people in the war together.
图/读者提供社会各界的捐赠去哪儿了呢？不仅协和医院领不到物资。
Picture / Readers provide information on where the donations from various sectors of the community have gone? Not only did Concorde Hospital get no supplies.
昨日，武汉市一些其他医院，还有黄冈市、咸宁市等地医院前来，都没有领到物资。
Some other hospitals in Wuhan, as well as hospitals in Huanggang and Xianning, did not receive supplies yesterday.
也是直到昨日，武汉红十字会才第一次公布的物资发放明细：1月30日仅有13家医院领到了物资。
It was not until yesterday that the Wuhan Red Cross made public the details of its first distribution: only 13 hospitals received supplies on January 30.
而武汉目前有61家医院设立定点发热门诊，24家医院被临时改造成发热病人收治医院，物资的缺口依然很大。
Wuhan now has 61 hospitals set up fixed-point fever clinics, 24 hospitals have been temporarily transformed into fever patients admitted to hospitals, the material gap is still large.
据新华社报道，截至30日，武汉市红十字会已接收社会各界防疫资金6.0808亿元，和9316箱口罩、74522套防护服、80456个护目镜以及其他药品和医疗器械。
As of June 30, the Wuhan Red Cross Society had received 608.08 million yuan in epidemic prevention funds, 9,316 cases of masks, 74522 suits of protective clothing, 80,456 goggles and other medicines and medical devices, Xinhua reported.
南方人物周刊致电武汉市红十字会了解情况。
Southern personage weekly calls Wuhan City Red Cross to understand the situation.
对方承诺由个人与企业定向捐赠医院的物资，可以定向发放，但非定向捐赠的物资，由卫健委和武汉市新型肺炎防控指挥部统一分配、发放给医院。
The materials promised by the other party for targeted donation to hospitals by individuals and enterprises may be distributed in a targeted way.But materials not earmarked for donation shall be allocated and distributed to hospitals by the Wei Bodyguard Commission and the Wuhan New Pneumonia Prevention and Control Command.
武汉卫健委的工作人员则说，医院每天提交需求给卫健委，具体分配仍转由红十字会负责。
Wuhan health committee staff said that the hospital every day to submit needs to the health committee, the specific allocation is still the responsibility of the Red Cross.
昨晚，武汉市政府党组成员李强在湖北肺炎疫情防控工作例行新闻发布会上坦陈，红十字会物资调拨不够及时需改进。
Last night, Li Qiang, a member of the Wuhan government party group, admitted at a regular press conference on the prevention and control of pneumonia in Hubei province that the Red Cross's allocation of materials needed to be improved.
他同时指出，目前目前消耗量大于供应量，是医院物资不足的主要原因。
He also pointed out that current consumption is greater than supply, which is the main reason for the shortage of hospital supplies.
与此同时，昨晚多家媒体拍摄的照片和视频显示，位于武汉市汉阳区国博中心A馆的武汉红十字的仓库，物资堆积成山。
Meanwhile, photos and videos taken by various media last night showed a mountain of materials piled up at Wuhan Red Cross warehouse in the A Pavilion of Guobo Center in Hanyang District, Wuhan.
另有名为“微博婶儿”的用户发微博质疑，自己定向捐赠给武汉市黄陂区中医院的9840副医用手套，1月27日显示签收，但黄陂中医院一直没有收到。
Another user, named "Aunt Weibo," questioned the receipt of 9840 pairs of medical gloves donated to Huangpi District Hospital of Huangpi District, Wuhan.
三日后多次致电武汉市红十字会，对方表示“物资太多，没办法去找。
Three days later several calls to Wuhan Red Cross, the other side said "too much material, there is no way to find.
”当前，红十字会几乎成为捐赠物资唯一的入口。
The Red Cross is now almost the only entry point for donations.
湖北省要求“物资捐赠统一归口，向湖北省捐赠要通过省红十字会，向武汉市捐赠要通过武汉市红十字会”。
Hubei province demanded "unified donation of materials, donations to Hubei Province through the provincial Red Cross Society, to Wuhan City donated through the Wuhan Red Cross."
但武汉市红会常务副会长陈耘接受采访时说：武汉市红会只有十个人，人手非常紧张。
But Wuhan Red Cross Society has only ten people, and its staff is very tight, Chen Zhu, the city's standing vice president, said in an interview.
尽管市府支援了统计局三十人做物资清查和登记，但仍然是“没办法”。
Although the city government has supported the Bureau of Statistics in its inventory and registration of 30 people, there is still "no way."
很多民间慈善机构此刻也在跟病毒赛跑。
Many non-governmental charities are now racing against the virus.
以韩红慈善基金会为例，基金会每日公布“援驰武汉”的项目进展，已有七批物资抵达武汉及周边城市，近30万只医用外科口罩、6000套防护服和50台血气分析仪即将发放。
In the case of the Han Hong Charity Foundation, the foundation publishes a daily report on the progress of the project. Seven shipments have arrived in Wuhan and surrounding cities, and nearly 300,000 medical surgical masks, 6,000 suits and 50 blood gas analyzers are on the way.
图/读者提供统筹物资的发放标准是什么？前日，湖北省红十字会首次在官网公开第一批次防控新型冠状肺炎捐赠物资使用情况，身处一线、防疫压力极大的协和医院也只收到来自陕西韩女士的三千只口罩。
The Red Cross Society of Hubei Province released the first batch of donated materials for prevention and control of new coronary pneumonia on official website for the first time the day before yesterday.
在同一张表上，有三万六千只N95口罩流向了两所莆田系医院。
On the same list, 36, 000 N95 masks were flowing to the two Putian hospitals.
其中一家仁爱医院并不是发热病人的定点收治医院，该院主治妇科、产科和不孕不育等。
One of the hospitals is not a designated hospital for febrile patients, which specializes in gynaecology, obstetrics and infertility.
昨晚，仁爱医院的院长接受媒体采访时解释说：我们身处疫区，向社会求不来口罩，向市红十字会求不来口罩，只能向省红十字会求助，目前，医院两百多个职工已经常规消耗了这批口罩1.2万只。
In an interview with the media last night, the director of Yan Oi Hospital explained that we were in an epidemic area. We were unable to find masks from the community, could not ask for masks from the City Red Cross, and had to turn to the provincial Red Cross for help.
而武汉协和医院身处疫情一线的医护人员是这个数字的两倍。
Wuhan Concorde Hospital is on the frontline of the epidemic with twice that number.
一天后，省红十字会称“对有关信息进行了复核”，发现确因工作失误导致公开的信息不准确。
A day later, the provincial Red Cross said it had "reviewed the information" and found that the information disclosed was inaccurate due to a mistake.
现“N95口罩36000个”更正为“KN95口罩36000个”，其流向“武汉仁爱医院1.6万、武汉天佑医院1.6万”更正为“武汉仁爱医院1.8万个、武汉天佑医院1.8万个”。
The current figure of 36,000 N95 masks has been corrected to 36,000, and its flow to Wuhan humane love hospital, 16,000 to Wuhan Tianyou hospital has been corrected to 18,000 to Wuhan humane love hospital and 18,000 to Wuhan Tianyou Hospital.
省红十字会在公开声明中称，KN95不能用于一线人员防护，所以发给了参与疫情普通医院。
The provincial Red Cross Society said in a public statement that KN95 could not be used for frontline personnel protection, so it was distributed to general hospitals involved in the epidemic.
武汉市红十字会在回应南方人物周刊询问时，提及接收物资不少都不符合标准，不能发给一线医护人员。
The Wuhan Red Cross, in response to a query from the Southern Personality Weekly, mentioned that many of the items received were substandard and could not be distributed to front-line medical personnel.
但多位协和的医护人员表告诉南方人物周刊，一些科室已经把日用自筹的不合标物资都顶上了。
But a number of Concorde's medical staff told the Southern Personality Weekly that some departments had already capped their daily self-financing supplies.
刘欣告诉我们，他们收到的各界捐赠物资也有不少不符合医用标准，比如工业口罩和工业防护服。
Liu told us that many of the donations they received did not meet medical standards, such as industrial masks and industrial protective clothing.
但这些不达标物资并不会浪费，医院保安或者清洁工等二线人员能够得到使用，他们每天奋战在分诊、维持秩序和环境清洁的一线，接触大量的病患和医疗废弃品，他们的安全也是保证医院正常运转、控制疫情再度传播的重要关键。
But these substandard materials are not wasted. Second-line workers, such as hospital security guards or cleaners, can be used. They fight daily on the front lines of outpatient, crowd-control, and environmental cleanup, and are exposed to large quantities of patients and medical waste. Their safety is also critical to ensuring proper functioning of hospitals and controlling the re-spread of the epidemic.
这十天来，协和的物资是每天筹集一点就用一点，连84消毒水这样的基础物资，整个医院的储存最多也就是三百瓶，这个数量远远无法覆盖全院的需求。
Over the past ten days, Concorde's supplies had been raised at a fraction a day, and even basic supplies such as disinfectant 84 had been stored in the hospital at most three hundred bottles, a quantity that fell far short of the needs of the entire hospital.
所有的物资优先保证发热门诊、隔离病房和重症科室，大部分科室都分不到足够物资，医护人员只能就地取材，用垃圾袋当鞋套，用泳镜当护目镜。
All supplies give priority to fever clinics, isolation wards and intensive care units, most of which do not have enough supplies. Medical staff can only use garbage bags as shoe covers and swimming goggles as goggles.
武大北加州校友会和华科北加州校友会联合捐赠了一批2.5吨的医疗物资送入协和医院图/读者提供协和医院终于接收到了民间捐赠截止到目前，协和医院收到的物资全部来自企业和个人捐赠。
The University of California Alumni Association and the North Carolina Alumni Association of China jointly donated 2.5 tons of medical supplies to the Concorde Hospital Map / Readers' Concorde Hospital finally received private donations.
物资直接对接到各地疫情指挥部或是各家医院，是最有效的。
Materials are most effective when delivered directly to epidemic headquarters or hospitals.
企业和个人的直接捐赠，中间环节精简，能够最快抵达医院。
Direct donation from enterprises and individuals, the intermediary link is streamlined, can reach the hospital as quickly as possible.
为了节约时间，物资抵达武汉后，协和直接派出小货车去高速关卡或是机场接货。
To save time, supplies arrived in Wuhan, Concorde sent pickup trucks directly to high-speed checkpoints or airport pick-up.
“说实话，现在就有点八仙过海，各显神通的意思。
"To tell you the truth, there are some faeries in the world right now.
”一位协和的医生说。
'said a doctor of concord.
危急时刻，有时候全靠个人人脉的突破。
In times of crisis, sometimes it's all about personal connections.
有的医生自己联系朋友调配物资，捐赠到自己的科室；还有的护士联系了商超，向科室捐赠了一批盒饭——医院食堂正常运转，但医生们多数赶不上开饭时间。
Some doctors made contact with their friends and donated materials to their own departments. Others contacted the doctors and donated boxed meals to the department. The canteen was working normally, but most of the doctors were late for dinner.
当协和的医生们拆开物资时，他们常能看到物资箱上写着：“全国人民和你们在一起，一定要加油。
When Concorde's doctors opened the supplies, they would often see the words, "The people of this country are with you.
”“真的很感动”，一位协和医生说。
"I was really touched," said a Concorde doctor.
他还希望南方人物周刊告诉大家，虽然物资很紧缺，但是他们真的不需要滑雪眼镜了。
He also wants Southern Man to tell everyone that they really don't need ski glasses, despite the shortage of supplies.
他们很感谢不知名的捐赠方，但滑雪眼镜并不能够作医疗用途。
They are grateful to unknown donors, but ski glasses are not fit for medical use.
在发出求助微博后，协和医院昨日驶入了两辆大货车，一辆小货车。
After tweeting for help, Concorde Hospital yesterday entered two lorries, a pick-up truck.
其中不仅有医疗用品，也有食品和其他日用品。
This includes not only medical supplies, but also food and other commodities.
其中，2.5吨来自武汉大学北加州校友会和华科北加州校友会的联合捐赠。
Of these, 2.5 tons came from a joint donation from the Wuhan University Alumni Association of Northern California and the Huaco Americana Alumni Association.
包括20万只医用口罩，2.75万双医用手套和4000件防护服，已在昨日下午直接送入协和医院。
Two hundred thousand medical masks, 27,500 pairs of medical gloves and 4,000 pieces of protective clothing were taken directly to Concorde Hospital yesterday afternoon.
这批货物本来也应交由红十字会统筹发放，但是考虑到周转效率，捐赠方通过各种沟通和争取，直接把物资交到了医院，但把物资在红十字会做了登记。
The shipment should also have been distributed centrally by ICRC, but, given the efficiency of the turnover, the donors delivered the materials directly to the hospital through various communications and solicitations, but registered them with the Red Cross.
不过，这些物资并不能全数补给协和医院，还将由协和协调分配给同样处在物资紧缺之困的中南医院，同济医院等其他医院。
However, the supplies will not fully resupply the Concorde hospital and will be distributed by Concorde to other hospitals, such as Tongji Hospital, which are also suffering from material shortages.
