新华社 图据《日本经济新闻》报道，新补助金制度的主要对象是为了照顾孩子而不能上班的职工。
The main target of the new grant system is workers who are unable to work to care for their children, according to the Japan Economic News.
除了日本首相安倍晋三要求停课的中小学、幼儿园以及托儿所等场所的工作人员外，没有得到官方认可的保育机构、托儿所以及“保育妈妈”（保育ママ，针对3岁以下儿童的非正式保育员）也在受助范围内。
There are no officially recognized child-care institutions, nurseries, and "nursing mothers" (care-taking quilts, informal nurseries for children under three years of age), with the exception of staff in schools, kindergartens, and nurseries, where Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has requested that classes be suspended.
在2月27日至3月31日期间，受助者每天最多可领取8330日元（约555元人民币），受助者以何种形式被公司雇佣，以及受助者公司的企业规模不会影响补助金的多少。
From February 27 to March 31, recipients will receive a maximum of 8,330 yen (555 yuan) per day, in what form they will be employed by the company, and the size of the recipient's business will not affect the size of the grant.
据日本《朝日新闻》报道，补助金的发放对象不限于孩子的监护人，如果孩子的爷爷奶奶或是外公外婆为了照顾孩子而向公司请假，也可接受补贴。
Japan's Asahi Shimbun reported that the allowance is not limited to the child's guardian, but is also accepted if the child's grandparents or maternal grandmother take leave from the company to care for the child.
除了职工休息一整天的情况以外，请假半天等情况也可以得到相应时间的补助金。
In addition to a full day's rest, a half-day off may be granted for the corresponding period of time.
受新冠肺炎感染范围扩大的影响，2月27日，日本首相安倍晋三宣布，要求全国所有小学、初中和高中从3月2日起暂时停课。
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced on February 27 that all primary, middle and high schools across the country would be suspended from March 2, following the spread of new crown pneumonia.
安倍表示，“各地区都在努力防止病毒在孩子们之间扩大感染，这1、2周之内是非常重要的时期”。
"Every region is trying to prevent the virus from spreading infection among children, and this is a very important period within a week or two," Abe said.
5日，日本文部科学大臣荻生田光一在参议院预算委员会上，就因新冠肺炎疫情临时停课的情况表示，截至当地时间5日早上，日本全国中小学的停课率已经达到99%。
Japanese education minister Ogiso Tanaka told a Senate Budget Committee on Monday that the nation's primary and secondary schools had suspended classes as of the morning of Monday to 99 percent because of the outbreak of pneumonia.
