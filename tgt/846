经济观察网 记者 陈月芹2月10日下午，武汉市硚口区广电江湾新城小区内，一名70岁的疑似新冠肺炎患者梁某跳楼身亡。
Chen Yueqin, a 70-year-old suspected New Crown Pneumonia patient, was killed when he jumped off a building in Zhengkou district of Zhengkou District of Wuhan on February 10, 2007.
。
.
梁某儿子梁鑫告诉经济观察网记者，其父于2月10日14：57从9楼家中的阳台处跳下的，当场身亡。
Liang's son, Liang Xin, told Economic Watch that his father jumped from the balcony of his home on February 10 at 14: 57 and died on the spot.
大约20分钟后，110、120及法医到达现场。
About 20 minutes later, 110, 120 and the forensics arrived.
经法医鉴定，梁某的死不是他杀。
After forensic expertise, Liang's death was not killed by him.
。
.
梁鑫透露，由于父母均疑似感染新冠肺炎，自己没和父母亲住在一起，在汉阳区的家中隔离，并照顾两个孩子。
Liang revealed that because his parents were suspected of contracting pneumonia, he did not live with his parents, in Hanyang District home isolation, and care for two children.
其父跳楼时只有母亲在场，只对母亲留下一句“不想连累你”，便用手撑着栏杆往下翻。
His father jumped only in the mother's presence, only to leave a "do not want to compromise you," then with his hands on the railing turned down.

重度尿毒患者。
Severe uremia.
梁鑫告诉经济观察网，其父罹患尿毒症已5年，一直在硚口区的中山医院进行透析治疗。
Liang told Economic Watch that his father had been suffering from uremia for five years and had been undergoing dialysis treatment at Zhongshan Hospital in Zhangkou district.
。
.
1月27日，梁某在湖北省中山医院做透析时出现发烧症状，怀疑此前在医院治疗期间可能被周围患者感染，便在医院发热门诊做了检查。
On January 27, Liang developed fever symptoms during dialysis at Zhongshan Hospital in Hubei Province and was examined at a hospital fever clinic after being suspected of having been infected by patients during hospital treatment.
CT结果显示，梁某双肺有片状模糊影，双肺感染或少许肺水肿，主动脉、冠脉硬化，双肾萎缩。
CT findings showed that both lungs of Liang have flaky blur, bilateral lung infection or a little pulmonary edema, aorta, coronary artery sclerosis, atrophy of both kidneys.
。
.
中山医院医生告诉梁鑫，因其父疑似感染新冠肺炎，医院不再给他做透析，建议去普爱医院。
Zhongshan Hospital doctors told Liang Xin that his father was suspected of contracting pneumonia, the hospital did not give him dialysis, recommended to go to universal love hospital.
6天后，几经辗转，父亲在普爱医院做了1次透析，但被告知必须确诊为新冠肺炎，后续才能在普爱医院继续治疗。
Six days later, after several tossing and turning, my father underwent dialysis at Pu Ei Hospital, but was told that he had to be diagnosed with pneumonia before he could continue treatment at Pop Love Hospital.
。
.
由于社区一直未能安排核酸检测，这成为了父亲做的最后1次透析。
This was his last dialysis since the community had been unable to schedule a nucleic acid test.
截至2月10日，父亲去世，原本每周需透析3次的父亲，已经8天没做透析了。
As of February 10, his father, who had to undergo dialysis three times a week, had not had dialysis for eight days.
。
.
“父亲是重症尿毒症患者，不能及时做透析的话，身体里的水排不出去。
"Father is a severe uremia patient, can not do dialysis in time, the body of the water can not be discharged out.
”梁鑫说，其父已7天吃不了饭，腹泻不止，奄奄一息。
Liang said his father had been unable to eat for seven days and was dying of diarrhea.
。
.
“普通病人在家隔离1-2周没有问题，但重度尿毒症不是普通病人，做不了透析会死！”梁鑫向社区、街道反映过父亲的病情后，希望能加急处理，但得到的回应是，“疑似病例只能居家隔离”，“在走流程中”。
"There is no problem for ordinary patients to isolate at home for 1-2 weeks, but severe uremia is not a common patient and will die without dialysis!" Liang Xin has told the community and the street about his father's illness and hopes to deal with it more quickly.
。
.
梁鑫又多次拨打市长热线，工作人员告诉他，其父的情况已经受理，请耐心等待。
Liang Xin repeated calls to the mayor hotline, staff told him that his father's situation has been accepted, please be patient.

没等来核酸检测。
Nucleic acid testing is pending.
梁某跳楼前一天，2月9日，社区通知梁鑫哥哥接送父亲去古田街道卫生服务站，做核酸检测。
Leung jumped the day before February 9, the community notified Liang Xin brother to take his father to the Gutian street health service station, do nucleic acid testing.
二人到达时，社区工作人员称做检测的医生已经下班了，明天早上8:30再来。
When they arrived, community workers said the doctor who had been tested had left work and would come back tomorrow morning at 8: 30.
。
.
等到2月10日，梁鑫的父亲和母亲提早15分钟在古田街道社区服务站门口等待，“我爸当时还蛮高兴”。
By February 10, Liang's father and mother waited at the gate of Gutian Street Community Service Station 15 minutes early. "My father was happy."
等到约定的9:30，现场没有见到工作人员，梁鑫给社区工作人员打电话询问情况，对方说社区已经安排上了，但突然发现没有咽拭子，也没有医生来做检测，让他们在古田街道社区服务站继续等。
When the appointed 9: 30, the scene did not see staff, Liang Xin called community workers to inquire about the situation, the other side said the community has arranged, but suddenly found no swabs, no doctor to do tests, let them continue at the Gutian Street community service station.
。
.
“我爸一星期没有吃饭了，在社区服务站里坐立不安，而且大小便出现失禁。
"My dad didn't eat for a week, fidgeted at the community service station and had incontinence.
”得知两位老人在社区等不及了，梁鑫再次打电话请求社区加急处理，社区说可以先拿号，回家等通知。
"Knowing that the two elderly people in the community can not wait, Liang Xin again called the community to request urgent processing, the community said that can take the number, home and so on notice.
。
.
到了下午3点左右，梁某依然没能等来社区能安排核酸检测的消息。
Around 3 pm, Liang still did not wait for the community to arrange nucleic acid testing news.

10日晚上9点多，梁某的遗体被专车运走。
More than 9 p.m. on the 10 th, Liang's body was taken away by a special car.
。
.
一个小时后，同是疑似新冠肺炎的老伴住进普仁医院。
An hour later, his wife, who was also suspected of pneumonia, was admitted to Puren Hospital.
。
.
对网传梁某跳楼是“为了用绝路换来老伴的希望”，梁鑫表示了否定。
On the network beam a jump building is "in exchange for the hope of a dead end mate," Liang Xin expressed the negative.
他告诉经济观察网，其父尿毒症的情况危急，他只是不想拖累家人，饱受折磨之后才绝望轻生。
He told the Economic Watch that his father was in a critical condition of uremia and that he just didn't want to drag his family down until he was desperate.
。
.
一位该小区物业人员许庭（化名）告诉记者， “老人的尿毒症做透析，没有医院愿意接收。
Xu Ting, a residential property worker (alias), told reporters: "The elderly uremia dialysis, no hospital willing to accept.
另一方面，现在医院床位紧张，一直没能够安排核酸检测和派车送老人去医院，才导致老人寻短见。
On the other hand, the shortage of hospital beds, the failure to arrange nucleic acid testing and the sending of cars to hospitals have led to suicide among the elderly.
