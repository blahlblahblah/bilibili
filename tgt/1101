十堰10万汽车人口与武汉关系特殊，但专家称不应滥用“战时管制”2月12日晚，湖北省十堰市张湾区新冠肺炎疫情防控指挥部发布《张湾区全域实施战时管制的紧急通告》。
Shiyan 100, 000 auto population and Wuhan special relationship, but experts said that "wartime control" should not abuse the night of February 12, Hubei Province Shiyan City Zhangwan District Zhangguan pneumonia epidemic control command issued the "Zhang Wan region-wide implementation of wartime control emergency notice.
“战时管制”这个提法，引发了广泛关注。
The term "wartime control" has aroused widespread concern.
通告提到，从2月12日24:00起，张湾区实施战时管制，“所有楼栋一律实施全封闭管理，所有居民非医护人员、医药物资从业人员、抗疫公务人员和水电油气、通讯网络、粮食蔬菜等基本民生保障从业人员，不得出入楼栋。
Since 2400 hours on February 12, Zhang Wan has been under wartime control. "All buildings are under a closed administration and all residents, including non-medical workers, medical and material workers, anti-epidemic officials and other basic livelihood security workers, such as hydropower, oil and gas, telecommunications networks and grain and vegetables, are not allowed to enter or leave the building.
”此外，除抗疫车辆、公务用车等外，“其它车辆一律禁止出入”，“居民基本生活必需物资由乡镇、街道（开发区、工业新区）及村（居）委会负责定时、定品种定价格配送，急需药品实行代购服务。
In addition, "all vehicles except anti-epidemic vehicles and official vehicles are prohibited from entering or leaving the country" and "the basic necessities of life of the residents shall be distributed by towns, streets (development zones, new industrial districts) and village (residential) committees at fixed and fixed prices.
”王萌生活在张湾区，是在读法律硕士，通告既让她感到震惊，同时也十分困惑：“战时”是个非常特殊的情况，一个区是否有权力来宣布？即便真的需要进行“战时管制”，张湾区的疫情已经到如此严峻地步了吗？毕竟，武汉才是疫情最严重的地方。
Even though she was shocked to learn that "wartime" is a very special situation, and whether a district has the power to declare it, has the epidemic reached such a serious level in Zhangwan, even if "wartime control" is really needed? Wuhan, after all, is the worst affected area.
因和武汉关系特殊造成的压力在湖北，相比较武汉、孝感几个重灾区，十堰的疫情不属于最严峻的。
Because of the special relationship with Wuhan caused by the pressure in Hubei, compared to Wuhan, filial piety several serious disaster areas, Shiyan epidemic is not among the most serious.
截至2月14日12点，湖北省新冠肺炎确诊患者已达到51986例。
By 12: 00 on Feb. 14, the number of confirmed cases of Xinguan Pneumonia in Hubei Province had reached 51986.
17个市中，十堰累计确诊人数为586例，在省内排在第12位。
In 17 cities, ten weir cumulative number of confirmed cases is 586, in the province ranked 12th.
在十堰市内，张湾区累计确诊病例为143例，病例数不如最多的茅箭区。
Shiyan City, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in the Zhangwan District 143 cases, the number of cases is not as large as the Maotui District.
十堰并非湖北省最严重的市，张湾区也并非当地确诊病例最多的区，为什么会在全国第一个发布最严管制？张湾区副区长、区防指副指挥长肖旭在接受媒体采访时提到，在此时提出“战时管制”，主要是希望巩固强化此前的阶段性成果。
"Shiyan is not the worst city in Hubei province, and Zhang Wan is not the region with the highest number of confirmed cases in the country.
肖旭称，战时管制令的出台是经过充分酝酿，征求了辖区内老百姓的多方意见，召开会议，按程序形成文字并颁布。
Xiao said the wartime control order was issued after a thorough brewing, sought the jurisdiction of the common people's views, convened meetings, in accordance with the procedures written and promulgated.
十堰市委宣传部新闻科科长邓城也是事后才得知此事。
Shiyan City Propaganda Department Information Section Dengcheng is also after the fact only learned about this matter.
据他介绍，张湾区做出战时决策，并未上报十堰市疫情防控指挥部。
According to him, Zhang Wan made wartime decision, did not report Shiyan City epidemic control command.
他不知道决策背后的原因，但是他理解这个区面临的压力。
He did not know the reasons behind the decision, but he understood the pressures facing the area.
邓城告诉《中国新闻周刊》，从整个十堰市来看，确诊人数主要集中在城区，即茅箭区和张湾区。
Deng told China News Weekly that the entire Shiyan City, confirmed the number of people concentrated in the urban areas, namely Maotui District and Zhang Wan District.
这里有十堰的三所三甲医院：张湾区的东风总医院、茅箭区的太和医院、十堰市人民医院。
There are ten Shiyan three hospitals: Zhang Wan District Dongfeng General Hospital, Maowu District Taihe Hospital, Shiyan City People's Hospital.
十堰市的确诊患者大多送往这几家医院救治，成了这两个区确诊人数高居不下的原因。
Shiyan City, the diagnosis of the majority of patients sent to these hospitals for treatment, has become the two districts diagnosed high number of reasons.
“茅箭区有两所大医院，反映在数字上，疫情最严重。
"There are two major hospitals in Maotui District, which are reflected in the figures.
但实际情况是，张湾区在疫情的扩散传染和防控上，压力最大。
However, the reality is that Zhang Wan area in the spread of the epidemic and prevention and control, the most pressure.
”邓城说。
"said Duncan.
“张湾区面临的最大压力是，东风汽车公司的老职工留在了张湾区及其周边，但不少人的子女在武汉总部，过年回家看父母，这是我们防控的重点对象。
"The biggest pressure on the region is that Dongfeng Motor Co. 's old workers stayed in and around Zhang Wan, but many of their children are at Wuhan headquarters.
”邓城说。
"said Duncan.
王萌的父母是公务员，据她了解，十堰市最早确诊的病例中，很大一部分就是武汉回来的东风公司的员工。
Wang Meng's parents were civil servants, and she understood that a large proportion of the earliest cases diagnosed in Shiyan were employees of Dongfeng Company, which had returned from Wuhan.
“汽车”是十堰市的重要城市名片，十堰是随着第二汽车制造厂（后改名为东风汽车公司）的落户发展起来的工业城市。
"Automobile" is the important city name card of Shiyan City, Shiyan is the industrial city developed with the establishment of the Second Automobile Factory (later renamed Dongfeng Motor Company).
2003年，东风汽车公司总部迁往武汉，原址所在的张湾区，则留下了退休的老职工，以及众多附属产业链的企业。
In 2003, Dongfeng Motor Co. moved its headquarters to Wuhan, where it used to be, leaving behind retired workers and many businesses along the industrial chain.
当地政府粗略估算，十堰市的东风汽车公司职工和家属约有10万人。
The local government roughly estimated that Shiyan City Dongfeng Motor Company workers and dependants of about 100,000 people.
因此，十堰和此次新型冠状病毒最早爆发的武汉，有了一层特殊而紧张的联系。
Therefore, Shiyan and this new coronavirus first broke out in Wuhan, has a special and tense relationship.
专家称“战时管制”并不严谨目前，湖北已经有多地宣布“战时管制”或者类似措施。
Experts say "wartime controls" are lax. Hubei has already declared "wartime control" or similar measures.
在张湾区推出战时管制的当天，孝感市大悟县也宣布进入“战时”管制，对城区（镇区）小区楼栋实行战时封闭管理。
On the day of the introduction of wartime control in Zhangwan, Dawu County, Xiaogan City, also announced into "wartime" control, small residential buildings (townships) in wartime closed management.
2月13日，黄冈市发布了《关于黄冈市域范围内全面升级管控措施的紧急通告》，内容与张湾区的战时管制几乎相同，但措辞上并未提到“战时”二字。
On February 13, the city of Huanggang issued an Emergency Notice on Comprehensive Upgrade Control Measures in the Huanggang Region, which is almost identical to the wartime regulations in the area of Zhang Wan, but does not mention the word "wartime."
2月14日，孝感市云梦县也发布了“关于在云梦城区实施战时管制的紧急通告”。
Feb. 14, Xiaogan City Yunmeng County also issued "on the implementation of wartime control in Yunmeng City Emergency Notice."
孝感和黄冈是当前除了武汉外，全国新冠病毒疫情最为严重的地区。
Filial piety and Huanggang is the most serious area in China except Wuhan.
截止2月14日0时，孝感市累计确诊病例为3009人，黄冈市累计的确诊病例为2791人，仅次于武汉。
By 0000 hours on February 14, 3,009 cases had been confirmed in Xiaogan City, and 2,791 in Huanggang, just behind Wuhan.
这些地区宣布“战时管制”是否有法律依据？几个地区的官方公告称，紧急实施战时管制，依据是《治安管理处罚法》、《传染病防治法》和《突发公共卫生事件应急条例》等相关法律法规。
Several regional official communiqués state that emergency wartime controls are based on laws and regulations such as the Law on Public Security Administration, the Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases and the Emergency Regulations for Public Health Emergencies.
中国人民大学公共管理学院公共财政与公共政策研究所教授、公共政策研究院执行副院长毛寿龙告诉《中国新闻周刊》，“战时”这个概念，并不是一个很严谨的词汇。
Mao Shoulong, a professor at the Institute of Public Finance and Public Policy at the Chinese People's University and executive vice-president of the Institute of Public Policy, told China News Weekly that the concept of "wartime" was not a very strict term.
“这是用军事语言表达公共管理，但这不是法律用语。
"This is a military expression of public administration, but it is not legal language.
”毛寿龙认为，《传染病防治法》里，并没有这样的说法，“而是指疫情爆发时，政府有权对相关疫情采取管制措施。
According to Mao, there is no such term in the Communicable Disease Prevention and Control Act. "Rather, it means that when an outbreak occurs, the government has the right to take measures to control the outbreak.
”为什么会使用“战时管制”这个提法，张湾区副区长肖旭曾对媒体解释，“中央指导组孙春兰副总理在武汉提出了要把防疫工作进入战时状态抓实抓细，落实各项措施。
"In Wuhan, the vice premier of the Central Steering Group, Sun Chunlan, demanded that the epidemic prevention work be carried out in a wartime state and that measures be implemented.
我们提这个‘战时’，是想引起全社会的注意，尤其是引起我们辖区居民的重视和自觉。
We mention this' wartime ', is to attract the attention of the whole society, especially the residents of our area of attention and self-awareness.
”中国政法大学应急管理法律与政策研究基地主任林鸿潮不认可这样的做法。
Lin Hongchao, director of the Emergency Management Law and Policy Research Base at the Chinese University of Political Science and Law, disagrees.
他在接受媒体采访时表示，虽然现在有“打好疫情阻击战”的说法，（战时）作为一种修辞形容紧迫性没问题，但作为法律状态，明显没有依据。
In an interview with the media, he said that while there is now a "good fight against the epidemic," there is no question of urgency as a rhetorical description, but as a state of law, there is clearly no basis.
宪法规定，只有全国人大、全国大人常委会能决定战争状态的宣布，战争状态下，可以采取战时管制措施。
The Constitution stipulates that only the National People's Congress and the Standing Committee of National Adults can decide on the declaration of a state of war.
林鸿潮表示，各地不应滥用战时管制的说法。
Mr Lam said there should be no abuse of wartime controls.
