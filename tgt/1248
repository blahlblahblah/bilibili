44岁的上海货车司机李克胜，义务承揽运送医疗物资前往武汉的工作，带着7桶泡面，独自踏上千里之路。
Li Kesheng, a 44-year-old Shanghai lorry driver, volunteered to transport medical supplies to Wuhan with seven barrels of noodles on his own.
。
.
返沪后，他马不停蹄，再次踏上赴汉之旅。
After returning to Shanghai, he went on a new journey to China.
。
.
他曾接到妻子的电话：“为什么对自己这么不负责任？”他说；“正是因为我对自己负责任，我才要去，谁都不去了，怎么办？”。
He had a phone call from his wife saying, "Why are you so irresponsible about yourself?" He said, "It's because I'm responsible for myself that I'm going.
他目前正在隔离期，以下是他的口述：。
He is currently in isolation and the following is his oral statement.
李克胜开自己的车运送捐赠物资支援武汉。

我家在江苏常州。
My family is in Changzhou, Jiangsu.
2020年1月20日，有关疫情的消息已经很多了。
By January 20, 2020, there had been plenty of news about the epidemic.
我放弃了回家过年的计划，提醒全家做好防护后，便独自一人留在上海。
I gave up my plans to go home for the New Year and reminded my family to stay in Shanghai alone after taking precautions.
。
.
2020年1月28日晚上，我一个人在出租屋里刷手机，看到朋友圈里有人在转发上海红十字会招募货车司机的消息，这趟工作是运送医疗防护用具至武汉的消息，没有运输费，是义务的。
On the night of January 28, 2020, while I was cleaning my cell phone alone in the rental room, I saw someone in my friend's circle forwarding news that the Shanghai Red Cross was recruiting truck drivers for a medical protection package to Wuhan.
我有点心动，但也有朋友劝我：“多考虑考虑你的家人。
I was a bit emotional, but one of my friends urged me to "think more about your family.
”我考虑后觉得，最坏不过我一个人被感染，我哪都不去，就自己隔离着。
"I thought about it, but worst of all, I was infected alone, I didn't go anywhere and I isolated myself.
。
.
第二天起床，我就联系了上海红十字会，问他们应该怎么办。
When I got up the next day, I contacted the Shanghai Red Cross and asked what they should do.
他们说让我开着车去拉货，给我准备了捐赠函和口罩、油卡。
They told me to drive my car to pick up the goods. They got me a donation letter and a mask and gas card.
出门前，我在小区门口的超市买了7桶方便面。
Before I left, I bought seven barrels of instant noodles at the supermarket in front of my neighborhood.
在上海红十字会的仓库装好货后，他们还给我找来一个横幅，是红底白字的“武汉加油”，挂在车前，这样能让武汉的交警快速识别这是物资运输救援车辆。
After the Shanghai Red Cross warehouse was loaded, they also found me a banner, in red and white, "Wuhan refueling," hanging in front of the car, so that Wuhan traffic police can quickly identify it as a material transport rescue vehicle.
。
.
出发前，上海红十字会的工作人员跟我说，这是支援武汉，做得很对，然后给了我5个医用口罩，教我怎样佩戴，提醒我不要去聚集人群处，与人保持两米的距离。
Before I left, the staff of the Shanghai Red Cross told me that it was in support of Wuhan, that it was done right, and then gave me five medical masks to teach me how to wear them and to remind me not to get together and stay two meters away from people.
最后，工作人员还打开了一个箱子，准备给我一个防护服，让我到了就穿上。
Finally, the staff also opened a box, ready to give me a protective clothing, let me put on when I arrived.
。
.
晚上查了查路途信息，和武汉对接好交通放行，就直接出发了。
At night check the road information, and docking Wuhan docked good traffic release, then directly set out.
去一趟用了13个小时，我在中途服务站里歇息了会儿，吃了桶泡面，洗了把脸。
It took me 13 hours to make the trip. I took a rest at the halfway house, ate a bucket of noodles and washed my face.
便又接着上路。
"Then he went on his way.
进入武汉后，感觉也没有什么特别的，但是人和车确实太少了，我记得2003年非典时期街上也还有人，也没到封城和禁行的地步，这说明疫情一定很严重。
After entering Wuhan, there is nothing special about it, but there are so few people and cars. I remember there were people on the streets during SARS in 2003.
我长这么大没见到这么空荡荡的街，像我们跑运输跑多了，街面上没有一辆车，反而还感到不自在。
I have never seen such an empty street in my life. We run so much that we don't have a car on the street and feel uncomfortable.
。
.
在武汉，给我留下最深印象的就是武汉交警。
Wuhan, to my deepest impression is Wuhan traffic police.
当时迷了一次路，我把车停下来，跟交警同志问路，他立马就说”师傅你在后边跟着，我开车带你“。
Lost in the road, I stopped the car, and asked the comrade of the traffic police for directions, and he immediately said, "Master, you follow me, I will drive you."
。
.
在武汉，警车给我带过3次路。
In Wuhan, the police car took me three times.
。
.
第一趟送的是武汉同济医院、武汉红十字会、湖北省疾控中心。
The first trip was to Wuhan Tongji Hospital, Wuhan Red Cross, Hubei CDC.
刚到武汉红十字会，上海红十字会又来电话说还得再送一趟，而且一车装不下，需要两辆车，问我能不能再找一个人。
Just arrived at Wuhan Red Cross, Shanghai Red Cross has called to say that there is another trip, and a load, need two cars, ask me if I can find another person.
我给两三个朋友打了电话，他们都说在老家出不来。
I called two or three friends who said they couldn't get out of their hometown.
我只好回上海红十字会说，没有找到人，等我跑完第二趟，可以再跑一趟。
I had to go back to Shanghai Red Cross said that there was no one, when I finished the second trip, I can run again.
。
.
因为时间紧急，我卸完货就回上海了。
As the time was urgent, I unloaded the goods and returned to Shanghai.
回去的路上，我老婆给我来了个电话。
On the way back, my wife called me.
我没有告诉她我去了武汉。
I didn't tell her I had gone to Wuhan.
我只在出发前跟父母说了一声，当时他们不同意，但最后也没再多说，没想到父母和全家人说了。
I only spoke to my parents before I left, and they didn't agree, but I didn't say anything more until my parents and family said it.
。
.
电话里，老婆问我怎么对自己这么不负责任，为什么去之前都没有和她说。
On the phone, my wife asked me how to be so irresponsible to myself, why did not go before she said.
我和她说，不是我对自己不负责任，正是因为我对自己负责任，我才要去。
I told her that I wasn't responsible for myself and that it was because I was responsible for myself that I wanted to go.
她又说，这个病毒是没有特效药的，一旦染上，只能靠自身免疫力自愈。
She added that the virus is no specific drug, once infected, can only rely on their own immunity to self-healing.
我说；”这就像平常跑运输一样的，家里怕什么？“。
I said, "It's like running in the usual way. What are you afraid of at home?"
最后，我以好好开车为由，匆匆挂了电话。
At last, I hung up the phone for good driving.
不算说服她，但是已经去了，她也没办法了，只能跟我说，一定要做好防护。
Not to mention persuading her, but has gone, she also has no choice but to tell me, must be well protected.
。
.
第一趟回来，高速口看到我的捐赠函，没有收过路费。
On my first trip back, I saw my donation letter at the freeway. There was no tolls.
我是1月31号抵达上海，直接把车开到上海红十字会的仓库去装货，这次没来得及买泡面，好在还剩下3桶。
I arrived in Shanghai on January 31st and drove directly to the Shanghai Red Cross warehouse to load it. I didn't have time to buy noodles, but I still had three barrels left.
。
.
2月1号，我又到了武汉。
On February 1st, I went to Wuhan again.
两次在武汉，除了运送物资，我基本都在车上，透过车窗看一看武汉。
Two times in Wuhan, in addition to the delivery of goods, I am basically in the car, through the window to see Wuhan.
药店的门外人们排着长队，不知道是在买口罩还是在买什么药品。
People lined up outside the drugstore, not knowing whether to buy a mask or what to buy.
他们是秩序井然的。
They are in good order.
。
.
李克胜将捐赠物资送到武汉市红十字会。
Li Kesheng will donate materials to Wuhan Red Cross.

1号晚上从武汉城区出来，我跟上海红十字会说，我现在回去拉第三趟，但是为了自身安全和他人安全，我必须要休息一晚上，否则这么多天持续不休息，属于疲劳驾驶。
On the evening of the 1st, I told the Shanghai Red Cross Society that I was going back for the third time, but for my own safety and the safety of others, I had to take a night off, otherwise I would be tired from driving for so many days.
于是我在离武汉最近的服务区里停下，在车上睡了一晚，2号早晨7点又出发了，差不多晚上6点抵达上海。
So I stopped at the nearest service area in Wuhan, slept in the car for a night, set out again at 7 a.m. on the 2nd, and arrived in Shanghai at about 6 pm.
。
.
我本来想直接去拉货，再送一趟。
I was going straight to pick up the goods and send them again.
但没办法，这一次我一定要去隔离14天。
But I couldn't help it. This time I had to stay in quarantine for 14 days.
我住在一家酒店里，一日三餐有人送，每天需要量体温。
I live in a hotel where three meals a day are served and I need my temperature taken every day.
我跟上海红十字会说，等我出来以后，如果还需要我，我还能再去。
I told the Shanghai Red Cross that I could go again when I got out and needed me.
。
.
被隔离的这几天，家人经常和我发微信、打视频，问我的情况。
Isolated these days, my family and I often post letters, video, ask me about the situation.
我老婆和我说，如果体温超过37.5度，一定要及时上报，千万不能隐瞒，要照顾好自己。
My wife and I said that if the body temperature exceeds 37.5 degrees, we must report it in time. Never hide it. Take care of yourself.
。
.
我沿路拍了些小视频，发在抖音上，网友们都很支持我。
I took a few small video along the road, hair on the jitter, netizens are very supportive of me.
但我也不是想出名或者怎么样，我只是想尽一点微薄之力。
But I'm not trying to be famous or anything. I'm just trying to do a little bit.
。
.
我希望你们不是报道我一个人，而是所有运送救灾物资的驾驶员们，鼓励他们去运送救援物资，让他们别害怕。
I hope you're not covering me alone, but all the drivers of the relief effort, encouraging them to deliver it and not to be afraid.
支援武汉的人也不止我一个，但是我看到这方面的报道很少。
I am not alone in supporting Wuhan, but I see little coverage of it.
。
.
现在疫情还未好转，武汉仍在封城。
Now the epidemic is not improving, Wuhan is still closed.
身边的人或者媒体，各方面去鼓励一下，我想参与到物资运送的人会更多。
The people around me or the media, to encourage, I want to participate in the delivery of goods will be more people.
。
.
第一次到武汉，武汉红十字会就给我发了荣誉证书，上面写着我的名字，还有这样一句话，“感谢贵单位对武汉市红十字人道事业的关心、支持和信任，您的爱心将会为那些困境中的人们带来希望的曙光”。
Wuhan Red Cross Society on the first time to me issued a certificate of honor, my name, and the following sentence: "Thank you for your care, support and trust in Wuhan City Red Cross humanitarian cause, your love will bring hope to those in distress.
。
.
这是我开货车以来，第一次受到表彰，以前我从没想过，自己一个跑运输的还能做这种“危险”的事。
It was the first time I had been praised for driving a van, and I had never thought I could do such a "dangerous" thing by myself.
我经常看一些抗日战争剧、解放战争剧，为了国家，死了成千上万的人，他们也没考虑自己的后路，有些时候总需要有人去做一些事。
I often watch some anti-Japanese war dramas, war dramas of liberation, thousands of people die for the country, they do not think about their own road, sometimes need someone to do something.
中国人那么多，就算不是我，也会是其他人。
There are so many Chinese, if not me, they will be others.
。
.
一些人可以不理解，我们也不能道德绑架，每个人都有自己的信仰。
Some people can't understand, we can't morally kidnap, everyone has their own beliefs.
如果一个人没有精神层面的东西，那活一辈子有什么意思。
If one has nothing of a spiritual nature, what does it mean to live one's life?
我文化水平不怎么高，我觉得一个国就和一个家是一样的，每个人需要负责，大家要互相帮助。
I do not have a high level of education, I think a country and a home is the same, everyone has to be responsible, everyone to help each other.
。
.
眼下最希望武汉能赶快好起来，疫情赶快结束，然后全国人民好好生活。
At present, I hope Wuhan can quickly get better, the epidemic quickly over, and then the people of the whole country to live well.
我就是个普通的货车司机，对自己的未来没有什么期待，都已经40多岁了。
I'm a regular truck driver, with no expectations for my future, and I'm already in my 40s.
我在交社保，到时候有退休工资，现在能干一天是一天。
I'm paying my Social Security, and I'll get a retirement paycheck. One day a day.
我最大的愿望就是孩子能好，他现在在老家读5年的专科，今年要毕业了，我劝他去考专升本，学费不需要他操心。
My greatest wish is that the child can be well, he is now in his hometown five years of college, this year will graduate, I advised him to take the entrance examination, tuition fees do not need him worried.
。
.
我告诉他，现在的疫情是短暂的、突发的状况，不久后一切恢复，只有有文化，才能做一个对祖国有贡献的人。
I told him that the epidemic was short-lived and sudden, and that soon everything would be restored and that only a literate person would be able to contribute to his country.
