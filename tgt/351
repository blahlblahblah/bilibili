记者/韩谦 魏晓涵 李佳楠 张帆 颜星悦 佟晓宇 梁婷李东郭慧敏 实习记者/陈威敬龙天音编辑/杨宝璐宋建华被确诊为河南省首例新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎患者，曾于1月8日在太康县人民医院治疗国家卫健委消息，截至1月22日24时，收到国内25个省（区、市）累计报告新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎确诊病例571例，其中重症95例，死亡17例（均来自湖北省）。
Reporter / Han Qian Wei Xiaohan Li Jianfan Yan Xing Tong Xiaoyu Liang Ting Li Dongguo Huimin Intern Reporter / Chen Weijinglong Tianyin Editor / Yang Polo Song Jianhua was diagnosed as the first case of coronavirus infection in Henan Province.
13个省（区、市）累计报告疑似病例393例。
A total of 393 suspected cases have been reported in 13 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities.
另外，全国共有25个省（区、市）报告疫情，新增河北、辽宁、江苏、福建4省。
In addition, a total of 25 provinces (districts and cities) have reported the epidemic, with the addition of Hebei, Liaoning, Jiangsu and Fujian provinces.
23日凌晨两点，武汉市发布交通封城通告。
At 2 a.m. on the 23rd, Wuhan issued a traffic closure notice.
这份由“武汉市新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情防控指挥部”署名的第1号通报宣布，“自2020年1月23日10时起，全市城市公交、地铁、轮渡、长途客运暂停运营；无特殊原因，市民不要离开武汉，机场、火车站离汉通道暂时关闭。
"Since 10: 00 a.m. on January 23, 2020, the city's public transportation system, subway, ferry and long-distance passenger transport have been suspended. For no special reason, citizens should not leave Wuhan, and the airport and railway stations are temporarily closed.
”武汉市卫健委通报，目前全市发热患者增多趋势明显，确实存在发热门诊就诊排长队、留观床位紧张的现象。
Wuhan Health Commission reported that there is a clear trend of increased fever patients throughout the city, there is indeed a fever clinic out-patient queues, the phenomenon of tight observation beds.
同时，湖北各地均不同程度出现防疫物资暂时短缺现象，其他各地也不同程度地出现医护人员只有简单防护的情况。
Meanwhile, temporary shortage of epidemic prevention materials occurred in different places in Hubei, and only simple protection for medical staff appeared in different places.
北青深一度记者采访了解到，随着疫情的持续，省一级卫健委已开始向定点的医疗机构增加配置器材和设施，包括手套、口罩等基础物资。
As the epidemic continues, the provincial health committee has begun to equip designated medical institutions with additional equipment and facilities, including basic materials such as gloves and masks.
梁岩拍摄的发热门诊的医护人员具备疫区接触史的病人才能送检在持续咳嗽、发烧38度以上5天后，1月22日晚八点半左右，确诊为病毒性肺炎的梁岩终于输上了液。
Liang Yan's fever clinic staff have a history of contact with the affected areas can be sent for examination after a persistent cough, fever 38 degrees more than 5 days, January 22 around 8: 30 pm, the diagnosis of viral pneumonia finally on the Liang Yan.
期间，梁岩在上海市肺科医院和仁济医院屡次辗转就医。
During the period, Liang Yan in the Shanghai lung hospital and Yan Chai Hospital repeatedly to seek medical treatment.
1月18日，梁岩的体温达到38度以上，她没有看上发热门诊，仁济医院导诊台的护士将她指向急诊内科。
On January 18, when Liang Yan had a temperature of more than 38 degrees, she did not attend a fever clinic, and nurses at Yan Chai Hospital directed her to the emergency department of medicine.
此后，由于急诊内科病人太多，梁岩又转至急诊五官科，被按照病毒性感冒开口服药治疗。
Since then, because emergency medical patients too many, Liang Yan to the emergency department of five senses, according to the viral cold mouth medicine treatment.
21日上午，由于高烧不退，咳嗽进一步加剧，梁岩转诊至肺科医院，梁岩表示，在拍胸片后医生觉得有问题，要求进一步拍CT，而在缴费后，医生又以“喉咙可能发炎了，我们只能治疗肺”为由要求梁岩退款，并转回仁济医院。
The doctor asked for a further CT scan after taking the chest film. After paying the fee, the doctor asked for a refund of Liang Yan's money on the grounds that "the throat may be inflamed and we can only treat the lung."
转回仁济医院后，梁岩又辗转急诊五官科、发热门诊、呼吸科、急诊内科等多处科室。
After being transferred back to Yan Chai Hospital, Liang Yan turned to the emergency department of five senses, fever clinic, respiratory department, emergency medicine, and many other departments.
21日下午，经急诊五官科排查后，梁岩终于挂上了发热门诊的号。
On the afternoon of May 21, after the emergency department of five senses, Liang Yan finally hung up the number of the fever clinic.
当天，发热门诊的候诊室里挤满了四五十个病人，上海下着雨，雨中也蹲着等待的病人。
On that day, the waiting room of the fever clinic was crowded with 40 or 50 patients. It was raining in Shanghai and patients were squatting in the rain.
等待9个小时后，梁岩终于在晚上8点半排上了就诊。
After nine hours of waiting, Liang finally made her appearance at 8: 30 p.m.
期间，由于等待时间过长，她也试图去其他医院的发热门诊试试，密集的人群和漫长的等待是相似的，她最终又回到了仁济医院。
In the meantime, as she waited too long, she also tried to go to other hospitals for a hot clinic. The crowds were similar to the long wait and she eventually returned to Yan Chai Hospital.
仁济医院发热门诊的医生让她拍了CT，梁岩被确诊为病毒性肺炎，一天后，梁岩终于在急诊内科输上了液。
Yan Chai Hospital fever clinic doctors let her take a CT, Liang Yan was diagnosed with viral pneumonia, a day later, Liang Yan finally in the emergency medicine infusion.
虽未接触过武汉来的人，也没去过武汉，但当下的疫情、病毒人传人的特性让她不安。
Although has not contacted the Wuhan people, has not been to Wuhan, but the current epidemic, virus person-to-person characteristics makes her uneasy.
她向仁济医院提出，能否对自己的病毒样本送检，随后被拒绝。
She asked Yan Chai Hospital if she could send a sample of her virus for testing, which was rejected.
医生向她介绍现在医院的诊疗程序：只有具备武汉疫区接触史的人才给送检，即使其它所有的症状吻合，也不能送检。
The doctor introduced her to the current hospital procedures: only those with a history of contact with Wuhan epidemic areas will be sent for tests, even if all the other symptoms match.
按照普通的肺炎治疗路径，梁岩没有被隔离，她将在急诊内科接受10天的静脉注射治疗。
Liang Yan, who is not quarantined according to the usual pneumonia treatment route, will receive 10 days of intravenous treatment at the emergency department of medicine.
上海市浦东区疾控中心工作人员告诉深一度记者，他们不做病毒样本的检测，只有该区的医院送来样本，他们才会启动应急措施，将标本送至上海市疾控中心进行检测，市里在对标本进行调查后，觉得有必要才会进行试剂检测。
Shanghai Pudong District CDC staff told reporters that they do not test virus samples, only the district hospital sent samples, they will initiate emergency measures, the specimens sent to the Shanghai CDC for testing, the city after the sample investigation, will feel the need for reagent testing.
至于什么样的病人标本可以送检，该工作人员表示，“判断交给医院，他们做过相关培训，相信医院。
As for what kind of patient samples can be sent for examination, the staff said, "The judgement is handed over to the hospital, where they have been trained to trust the hospital.
”在22日的采访中，梁岩称，医生告诉她，除非她十天半个月后病情加重，才会将她的病毒样本送检。
In an interview on the 22nd, Liang said doctors told her she would not send samples of the virus for testing until she was more ill in half a month.
直到现在，梁岩并不清楚自己的肺炎是由什么病原体引起。
Until now, Liang Yan did not know what pathogen caused his pneumonia.
1月22日，疫情发生后的第23天，国家卫计委公布新修订的《新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎诊疗方案（试行第三版）》中，增加了“出现无武汉旅行史的确诊病例”。
On January 22, 23 days after the outbreak, the National Health and Planning Commission announced a new revised diagnosis and treatment programme for coronavirus infection (trial version 3), adding "confirmed cases without Wuhan travel history."
接诊医生急盼防护服在梁岩所就诊医院的发热门诊，医生还有全套防护服和护目镜可穿戴。
The attending doctor is anxious for the protective clothing to be worn at the fever clinic of Liang Yan Hospital. The doctor also has full protective clothing and goggles.
但一些更基层医院的发热门诊，防护服刚刚下发，或只有简单的工作服与口罩。
But some of the more basic hospitals of the fever clinic, protective clothing has just been issued, or only simple work clothes and masks.
在江西省抚州市东乡区下属县级二甲医院工作的王强，还没等到防护服发放到发热门诊，从武汉返乡的人潮就涌来了。
Wang Qiang, who works at the county-level Erqiang Hospital in Dongxiang District, Fuzhou, Jiangxi Province, has not yet waited for the distribution of protective clothing to the fever clinic, the flow of returnees from Wuhan has poured in.
王强刚好赶上在发热门诊轮岗，21日晚，他接诊了两名从武汉来的发热患者，虽然最后的检查结果是非病毒性感染，新闻通告中不断攀升的确诊、死亡病例的数字，还是让没有防护服的轮班医生感到了紧张。
Wang Qiang just in time in the heat clinic, 21 night, he received two patients from Wuhan fever, although the final test results are non-viral infection, the rising number of cases of diagnosis, death in the news bulletin, or no protective clothing of the shift doctors worried.
王强告诉深一度记者，发热门诊目前有六七位医生负责接诊患者，距离武汉的疫情发生过去二十多天了，他们仅带着口罩和医用帽问诊。
Wang told reporters at one point that there were six or seven doctors in charge of treating patients at the fever clinic, more than 20 days after the outbreak in Wuhan, wearing only masks and medical caps.
他所在的发热门诊此前从未配备过防护服，直到前些天附近一个县城出现了疑似病例，这个问题才被重视起来。
His fever clinic had never been fitted with protective clothing before, and the issue was brought to the fore by a suspected case in a nearby county.
最近几天，医院内部进行了多次培训，市里组织了紧急电视电话会，向医务人员介绍最新的诊疗指南、防控方式以及对病毒的解读。
In recent days, several training sessions have been held within the hospital, and emergency telephone conferences have been organized in the city to introduce medical personnel to the latest clinical guidelines, methods of control and interpretation of the virus.
然而几天过去了，不仅是从武汉返乡的人员，许多没有到过武汉的发热患者也蜂拥而至，每天来发热门诊的人数从以往的十几个上升到几十个，防护服还没有从上级医院批下来。
However, a few days later, not only from Wuhan returning home, many did not come to Wuhan fever patients also flocked, the number of heating clinics from the past a dozen or so rose to dozens, the protective clothing has not been down from the higher hospital approval.
在王强看来，县级医院里的隔离条件“比较简陋”。
In Wang Qiang's view, the isolation conditions in county-level hospitals are "relatively simple."
虽然设置了专门提供给发热病人的发热通道，管制却没有太严格，有的患者不听医生劝说，会在发热通道之外行动。
Although there are special heating channels for febrile patients, the controls are not too strict, some patients do not listen to doctors, will act outside the heating channel.
22日下午，在市里进行了又一次紧急电视电话会之后，王强所在的发热门诊终于拿到了够用的防护服。
On the afternoon of the 22nd, after another emergency TV call in the city, Wang Qiang's fever clinic finally got enough protective clothing.
据报道，湖北各地也出现了不同程度防疫物资短缺现象。
It has been reported that shortages of epidemic prevention materials have occurred in different places in Hubei Province.
据有关部门测算，截至本月31日，湖北本省只能生产医用口罩800万个，防护服200万套，红外测温仪1200套，不能满足全省防疫需要。
Authorities estimate that as of the 31st of this month, only 8 million medical masks, 2 million suits of protective clothing and 1,200 sets of infrared thermometers could be produced in Hubei Province.
因此，湖北省拟向国家请求紧急支援，调拨医用口罩4000万个、防护服500万套、红外测温仪5000套。
Therefore, Hubei Province will request emergency support from the state to allocate 40 million medical masks, 5 million suits of protective clothing and 5,000 sets of infrared thermometers.
22日晚，武汉市副市长陈邂馨介绍，目前武汉市采取了“7+7”的医疗防控救治方法，即由武汉市内的同济、协和、省人民医院、中南医院等7家大型综合性医院，与7家市属医院结对子，计划腾出3400张床位，专门对发热患者进行治疗。
On the evening of May 22, Vice Mayor Chen Xinxin introduced that Wuhan city has adopted the "7 + 7" medical prevention and treatment method, namely, seven large-scale general hospitals in Wuhan city, such as Tongji, Concorde, Provincial People's Hospital and Zhongnan Hospital, twinned with seven municipal hospitals.
而此前一天武汉市卫健委宣布的数字是将设2000张床位集中收治武汉肺炎病人，两天公布的数字相加，意味着武汉市已经预备了至少5400个床位。
The figures, announced the day before by the Wuhan Health Commission, are for 2,000 beds to be used to treat patients with Wuhan pneumonia. Together, the figures released two days ago mean Wuhan has at least 5,400 beds ready.
太康县人民医院内部紧急培训基层医院加紧应急培训1月21日，浙江省确诊首例新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎患者。
First case of coronavirus infection in Zhejiang Province confirmed on January 21, 2007, emergency training within the basic hospital of Taikang County People's Hospital intensified.
确诊经过了三次诊断：17日，省疾控中心检测患者标本呈新型冠状病毒核酸阳性；20日，标本送至中国疾控中心进行复核检测，结果为阳性；21日，经国家卫生健康委疫情领导小组下设的诊断组专家评估，确认为确诊病例。
On February 20, the specimen was sent to the China CDC for a reexamination and testing, which proved to be positive. On the 21st, the case was confirmed to be a confirmed case by experts of the Diagnostic Group under the National Health and Health Commission.
浙江省内的一家县级人民医院的导诊台边贴上了告示：为了家人健康，请告知是否去过武汉。
In Zhejiang Province, a county-level People's Hospital at the edge of the counselling station posted notice: For the health of their families, please tell whether to go to Wuhan.
3天前，这家医院曾来过一名来自武汉来的肺炎病人，此后，医院将该名病人调至发热门诊留置观察。
The hospital transferred the patient to a fever clinic for observation three days after a case of pneumonia came from Wuhan three days ago.
据该院院长介绍，医院在抽取患者血样后，将样本通过救护车运输，直接送至市疾控中心实验室进行检测，大概6个小时后收到检测结果，患者的核酸检测为阴性，以此排除了新型冠状病毒感染。
After taking blood samples from the patient, the hospital transported them by ambulance and sent them directly to the CDC laboratory for testing, where they received negative nucleic acid tests about six hours later, ruling out a new coronavirus infection, the hospital said.
该院院长告诉深一度记者，目前省里要求，若有疑似病人不得随意转院，需要向上级部门请示，由上级派专家组来评估决定。
The hospital director told Shaanxi reporters, the current provincial requirements, if suspected patients can not be transferred to the hospital, need to consult higher departments, the higher level to send a team of experts to assess the decision.
如果病人确诊后转运，需要使用负压车运输，转院人员需穿戴防护服，并通过指定的路线转运到指定地点。
If the patient is diagnosed with transshipment and needs to be transported by a negative pressure vehicle, the transfer officer should wear protective clothing and transfer to a designated place via a designated route.
该院长还表示，来自武汉的发热病人被禁止在社区医院看病，需要去定点的发热门诊集中诊治。
The director also said that fever patients from Wuhan were banned from visiting community hospitals and needed to be attended to in designated fever clinics.
被确诊为河南省首例新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎患者，曾于1月8日于河南省周口市太康县人民医院呼吸内科治疗，并住院隔离治疗两日。
The case of pneumonia, diagnosed as the first case of coronavirus infection in Henan Province, was treated with respiratory medicine and hospitalized for two days on January 8 at Taikang People's Hospital, Zhou Kou City, Henan Province.
1月22日晚，深一度记者前往太康县人民医院探访发现，医院的医护人员大多带有医用口罩，而前来就诊的病人大多没有戴口罩，在确诊病人曾呆过的呼吸内科住院部，许多住院病人和家属也未戴口罩。
On the evening of January 22, a visit to Tai Hong County People's Hospital revealed that most of the hospital staff were wearing medical masks. Most of the patients who came to the hospital were not wearing masks, and many inpatients and family members did not wear masks at the inpatient department of respiratory medicine where the patients had been diagnosed.
多名医院保安人员告诉深一度记者，他们是1月22日上午才领到医院发放的口罩，统一进行佩戴。
Several hospital security personnel told the once-in-depth reporters that they had received their hospital-issued masks only in the morning of 22 January and were wearing them uniformly.
1月22日下午，河南省信阳市下属的一家县级肺炎医疗救治定点医院召开了关于如何预防和诊断新型冠状病毒感染肺炎的内部应急培训会。
On the afternoon of January 22, an in-house emergency training session on how to prevent and diagnose the new coronavirus pneumonia was held at a county-level hospital for pneumonia treatment and treatment in Xinyang, Henan Province.
该院急诊科主任康建介绍，诊断上来说，对于问诊者，首先要问流行病史，有没有去过疫区，或者同从疫区回来的人有过接触；其次就是看临床症状，是否出现发烧、干咳等症状，还需要做血常规检查，如果白细胞不高或者降低，淋巴细胞减少，就考虑是否为病毒感染。
According to Kang Jian, director of the emergency department of the hospital, the first part of the diagnosis is to ask the patient a history of the epidemic, whether he has been to an epidemic area or has come into contact with people returning from an epidemic area.
此外，要做胸部X片检查，若呈间质性肺炎，便需要进行核酸检测。
In addition, chest X-ray examination, if the case of interstitial pneumonia, the need for nucleic acid testing.
康建表示，“目前县里没有条件做核酸检测，医院负责采集病人的咽试纸、浓痰、血清，然后送到市疾控中心检测，最后确诊得靠省里专家。
"At present, the county is not equipped to do nucleic acid testing, the hospital is responsible for collecting patients pharyngeal paper, thick sputum, serum, and then sent to the city CDC for testing, the final diagnosis depends on provincial experts.
”这几乎是所有定点医院的处理方式。
This is how almost all designated hospitals are handled.
华中科技大学协和深圳医院副院长刘岩松介绍，在分诊点，护士会给患者戴上口罩，测量体温，并询问流行病学史，如发病前是否在武汉市旅游、工作、生活，是否接触过武汉新型肺炎的病人，是否接触野生动物等。
Liu Yansong, vice-dean of the Huazhong University of Science and Technology Concorde Hospital in Shenzhen, said nurses at the clinics would put on masks, take temperature measurements and ask about the epidemiological history, such as whether they had traveled, worked or lived in Wuhan before the onset of illness, whether they had been exposed to the new pneumonia in Wuhan and whether they had contact with wild animals.
对于符合相关条件的患者，会分诊到发热门诊就诊。
For patients who meet the relevant conditions, the fever clinic will be consulted.
在医务人员的防护方面，康建表示，目前的防护分三个级别，“一级防护是正常穿工作衣，戴医用口罩。
In terms of medical protection, Kang said there were three levels of protection. "The first level of protection is to wear normal work clothes and medical masks.
二级防护是在发热门诊和感染病区，有疑似病例的，得穿隔离衣。
Secondary protection is in the fever clinic and infection areas, suspected cases, have to wear protective clothing.
三级防护就要穿戴防护镜等装备。
Third-level protection requires the wearing of protective equipment such as mirrors.
”在康建看来，虽然现在医疗条件和诊断水平比非典时期强得多，目前医院尚未发现疑似病例，“但还是很担心，毕竟我们这里离武汉太近了。
According to Kang, although medical conditions and diagnoses are much stronger now than they were in the SARS period, no suspected cases have been found in hospitals, "but there is still concern that we are too close to Wuhan.
”目前所有病例需经省级疾控检测确认上海市疾控中心副主任孙晓冬此前在接受媒体采访时指出，目前所有的病例，都需要经过省级疾控中心实验室检测确认，区疾控中心和医疗机构都不承担病毒检测任务。
In an interview with reporters, Sun Xiaodong, deputy director of the Shanghai Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, confirmed that all cases now require laboratory confirmation from provincial CDC laboratories, and that neither the CDC nor the medical institutions are tasked with virus detection.
当前，对于确诊病例，将会采取隔离治疗措施。
At present, isolated treatment measures will be taken for confirmed cases.
而对于密切接触者，目前隔离的措施有集中隔离或居家隔离，隔离天数一般为14天。
In the case of close contacts, current measures of isolation include concentrated or residential isolation, which generally lasts for 14 days.
孙晓冬坦言，对于不明原因肺炎患者，从发现到确诊，需要经历的时间长短不同，不仅仅是因为检测需要时间，另外还需要对患者做流行病学调查，掌握其此前活动轨迹、作息规律等。
Sun admitted that patients with unexplained pneumonia require varying lengths of time from discovery to diagnosis, not only because testing takes time, but also because patients need epidemiological investigation to learn about their previous tracks, patterns of work and rest.
“譬如这个人去过哪里、吃过哪些东西、接触过什么人和动物等等，之前武汉明确很多不明原因肺炎病例都与华南海鲜市场有关联，都是通过详细的流行病学调查才能得出的结论。
"For example, where has this person been, what he has eaten, whom he has been in contact with, animals, etc., Wuhan has previously determined that many cases of unexplained pneumonia are linked to the South China seafood market, and these are the results of detailed epidemiological investigations.
”孙晓冬表示，对于类似的新型传染性疾病，就像“破案”一样，每个病例及其家人都需要积极协助卫生部门开展调查，及时告知最近的活动轨迹等，这样才有助于控制疫情的进一步扩散。
Dr Sun said that for similar new infectious diseases, as in "case detection," each case and its family would need to actively assist the health authorities in their investigations and keep abreast of the latest trajectory so as to help control the further spread of the epidemic.
由国务院于2003年5月9日发布并实施，并于2011年修订的《突发公共卫生事件应急条例》（以下简称“《条例》”）对疫情报告程序和时限作出严格限定，针对重大、紧急疫情国务院至迟在9小时内可知晓疫情。
The Emergency Regulations on Public Health Emergencies (hereinafter referred to as "the Regulations") promulgated and implemented by the State Council on May 9, 2003 and amended in 2011 strictly define the procedures and time limit for epidemic reporting.
同时，《条例》规定针对重大疫情可以越级上报。
At the same time, the Regulations provide that major outbreaks can be reported over time.
县卫生局在向县政府报告的同时，必须同时报告市(地)卫生局和卫生部；县政府在向市(地)政府报告的同时，还可以向省政府报告；国家将公布突发事件报告电话，任何单位和个人都有权向人民政府及其有关部门报告突发事件隐患。
While reporting to the county government, the county health bureau must also report to the municipal (prefectural) health bureau and the Ministry of Public Health; the county government may report to the provincial government at the same time as it reports to the municipal (prefectural) government; the state will publish the emergency report telephone number.
针对于此次新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎，香港、澳门地区及其他有确诊案例的国家也加强了检测和隔离措施。
In response to the new coronavirus infection pneumonia, Hong Kong, Macao and other countries with confirmed cases have also strengthened detection and isolation measures.
截至2020年1月21日，香港共呈报118宗疑似案例，其中88人已经出院，没有出现确诊案例。
As at 21 January 2020, a total of 118 suspected cases had been reported in Hong Kong. Of these, 88 persons had been discharged from the hospital and no confirmed cases had been reported.
香港特区政府食物及卫生局局长陈肇始在记者会上表示，特区政府加强了对怀疑个案的检测、由武汉来港航班实施健康申报表制并对武汉来港人员进行体温检测、公立医院继续实施探病措施，并已准备了足够三个月使用的防护装备和500张负气压隔离病床。
Speaking at a press conference, the Secretary for Food and Health, Mr Chan Siu-kwong, said that the HKSAR Government had stepped up surveillance of suspected cases, implemented a health declaration system for flights from Wuhan to Hong Kong and conducted temperature tests on entry staff in Wuhan, continued to carry out visits to public hospitals and had prepared enough protective equipment for three months and 500 negative pressure isolation beds.
