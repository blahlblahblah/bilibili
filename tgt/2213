摄影/长江日报 陈卓疫情之后，疾控改革往何处去本刊记者/彭丹妮 钱炜发于2020.3.2总第937期《中国新闻周刊》2020年1月23日，武汉封城，这一天，也是中国疾病预防控制中心（CDC）成立18周年的纪念日。
2007-9-19 15: 19 Where to Go for CDC Reform After Chen Zhuo's outbreak in the Changjiang Daily The Chinese News Weekly 2020.3.2 Issue 937 Wuhan January 23, 2020 marks the 18th anniversary of China's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
与此同时，中国的疾控系统迎来了继“非典”之后的第二次大考——这是一次更为严峻的检验。
At the same time, China's disease-control system has taken its second major test since SARS - a tougher test.
一周以后，中国CDC创始人、北京大学公共卫生学院教授李立明被召集重新出山，带领一批国内公共卫生领域的骨干们，为有关部门提供对疫情防控形势的研判、防控技术支撑等。
A week later, Li Liming, founder of China's CDC and a professor at the Beijing University School of Public Health, was summoned to re-emerge to lead a cadre of domestic public health practitioners to provide research and technical support to the disease prevention and control situation.
曾带领CDC战过“非典”的李立明，在被问到如今疾控系统的走向是否实现了当初的设想时，他淡淡地说，“不太满意”。
Li Liming, who led the CDC through SARS, blandly said, "Not satisfied" when asked if the disease control system is moving as intended.
表面的进步李立明曾在全美排名第一的约翰·霍普金斯大学公卫学院做博士后工作，对于要打造一个什么样的CDC，他脑子里有一个清晰的蓝图。
Despite the apparent progress, Li had worked as a postdoctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health, the nation's number one, and he had a clear picture of what kind of CDC to build.
2002年1月23日，中国疾病预防控制中心成立仪式在人民大会堂举行。
On January 23, 2002, the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was inaugurated in the Great Hall of the People.
李立明从中编办获得了2400个编制名额，又从全国抽调了18个业务骨干，建立起相对完整的疾控机构框架，即使在当时尚属空白的几个防控领域，如性病艾滋病、结核病，都一一设立了相应的机构。
Li Liming has won 2,400 posts from the Central Office and 18 operational cadres from across the country, setting up a relatively complete institutional framework for disease control, even though there were still gaps in several control areas, such as sexually transmitted diseases, AIDS, tuberculosis.
与从传染病起家的美国CDC不同，中国CDC一出生时就有着最全面的病种研究中心，可谓是高起点。
Unlike the US CDC, which began with infectious diseases, China's CDC was born with the most comprehensive center for disease research, a high-level start.
国家CDC挂牌11个月后，SARS暴发，让各级政府尤其是中央政府意识到疾控的重要性。
Eleven months after the national CDC was listed, the SARS outbreak made all levels of government, especially the central government, aware of the importance of disease control.
疫情过后，数百亿元资金进入到公卫领域，以前少人问津的疾控系统，发生了巨大变化。
After the epidemic, tens of billions of yuan of funds into the public health sector, the disease control system, which had little access to people, has changed dramatically.
CDC原副主任杨维中在接受《中国新闻周刊》采访时表示，他曾任主任的CDC疾病控制与应急办公室，以前不到10个人，每年经费300多万，SARS过后，人员扩充到50多名，经费增加到1亿元以上。
In an interview with China News Weekly, CDC's former deputy director, Yang Weizhong, said his former director, the CDC's Office for Disease Control and Emergency Response, had more than $3 million a year for less than 10 people.
多个高等级的生物安全实验室开始建设，高端设备不断配置，实验室检测能力、流行病学调查能力以及现场处置能力都得到快速提高。
A number of high-level biosafety laboratories have been built, high-end equipment is constantly being configured, and laboratory testing capabilities, epidemiological investigation capabilities and on-site disposal capabilities have been improved rapidly.
因此，这也才有了CDC现任主任、中科院院士高福在2019年全国“两会”上的那番话。
That is why CDC's current director, academician Gao Fu, spoke at the 2019 national "two-party conference."
当时，高福自信满满地对媒体表示：“经常有人问我，SARS过去十几年了，还会来吗？SARS这一类病毒随时都有可能出现，但我很有信心地说，SARS类似事件不会再出现，因为我国传染病监控网路体系建设得很好，这类事件不会再发生。
"People often ask me if SARS has been around for more than a decade or so," Gao told reporters confidently, "Do SARS viruses like this happen anytime soon, but I am confident that SARS will not happen again because our infectious disease surveillance network is well established and such incidents will not happen again.
”高福是中国CDC主任位置上的第一位院士。
Mr Gao is the first academician to head China's CDC.
CDC成立18年，只有三任主任，前两任主任李立明与王宇，皆为医学背景出身，后者担任主任长达13年之久，其间发生的较大公卫事件是2013年苏皖等地的禽流感H7N9疫情。
CDC was founded 18 years ago, there are only three directors, the first two director Li Liming and Wang Yu, both of medical background, the latter as director for 13 years, the major public health event occurred in 2013 Su Anhui and other places of avian influenza H7N9 epidemic.
高福的主要研究领域包括囊膜病毒与结构免疫学，以流感为代表的新发、再发传染病，研究重要囊膜病毒的分子进化特征、宿主互作模式、跨种传播机制以及病毒特异性的T细胞免疫与分子识别等。
Major areas of study include cystic membrane viruses and structural immunology, emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases such as influenza, molecular evolutionary characteristics of important cystic virus, host interaction patterns, cross-species transmission mechanisms, and viral-specific T-cell immunity and molecular recognition.
新型冠状病毒正属于囊膜病毒，也就是说，高福团队恰好就是中国研究新冠病毒最权威的团队之一。
The new coronavirus belongs to the cystic membrane virus, which means that Gao Fu's team is one of the most authoritative teams in China to study the new coronavirus.
拥有8个院士头衔的高福，作为一名科学家无疑是成功的。
With eight academician titles, Gao Fook was undoubtedly a success as a scientist.
一位长期观察公共卫生领域的国外人士评价他说，“在牛津和哈佛接受过训练的高福非常聪明，他深受全世界的同行喜爱，作为CDC的领导者，他是一流的。
"Fortune, trained at Oxford and Harvard, is very intelligent, he is loved by his peers around the world, and he is top-notch as a CDC leader," said a longtime foreign observer of public health
”2011年，高福出任国家CDC副主任，2017年8月，王宇因达到任职年龄界限而卸任，高福接任主任。
In 2011, Gao became deputy director of the country's CDC, and in August 2017, he left office after reaching the age limit for entry into office.
在此次新冠疫情之前，高福在CDC立下的著名功绩，就是他主导的援助埃博拉行动。
Prior to the new outbreak, Gao's celebrated feat at the CDC was his Ebola-led initiative.
对于传染病防控，高福一直奉行“关口前移”策略。
For the prevention and control of infectious diseases, Gao Fu has been pursuing a "pass forward" strategy.
他认为，如果非洲的疫情得不到控制，那么在全球一体化、交通高度发达的今天，埃博拉进入中国只是一个时间问题。
He said it was only a matter of time before Ebola entered China at a time of global integration and highly developed transportation if the epidemic in Africa was not contained.
因此，2014年，中国CDC派出了高福领衔的团队赴塞拉利昂，帮助当地开展病毒研究与疫情控制。
So, in 2014, China's CDC sent a team, led by Gao Fuk, to Sierra Leone to help with local research and epidemic control.
然而，随着武汉疫情的暴发，高福与他领导下的CDC遭遇了前所未有的信任危机。
However, with the outbreak of Wuhan epidemic, Gao Fu and his leadership of the CDC encountered an unprecedented crisis of confidence.
很多人都认为，CDC掌握了疫情信息却没有及时采取处置措施，也没有及时对外公布。
Many people believe that the CDC has information on the epidemic but did not take timely measures to deal with it, nor did it release it in time.
尽管CDC官员后来出面做了一些澄清，但效果并不理想。
Despite some subsequent clarifications by CDC officials, the results have not been satisfactory.
在国家CDC员工的眼里，高福是一个乐观、外向的领导者。
In the eyes of national CDC employees, Gao Fu is an optimistic, outgoing leader.
但他的那些“乐观”言论，在气氛紧张甚至有些凝重的抗疫初期，听起来并不合时宜。
But his "optimistic" comments did not sound appropriate in the early days of a tense and even dignified fight against the disease.
比如，在仅有的两次高福露面的发布会上，他先是称“儿童不易感”，后来很快被出现儿童新冠肺炎患者的事实推翻，继而他又说，“这个疫苗，我可以拍着胸脯讲，肯定会成功。
For example, in his only two appearances, he said that "children are not easy to feel," which was quickly overturned by the appearance of children suffering from pneumonia, and then added, "This vaccine, I can beat my chest, I'm sure to succeed.
”这些言论，事后被网友们挑出来反复地转发与评论。
"These comments were later picked out and repeated by netizens for comment.
江苏省预防医学会会长汪华曾担任江苏省疾控中心主任、省卫计委副主任。
Wang Hua, president of Jiangsu Preventive Medicine Society, served as director of Jiangsu CDC and deputy director of provincial health and planning committee.
他指出，根据《传染病防治法》，只有国家卫生行政部门及其委托的省级卫生行政机构才有权公布疫情，国家疾控中心与地方各级疾控中心都是没有权力对外发布疫情的。
He noted that, under the Communicable Diseases Act, only the national health administration and its delegated provincial health administrations were authorized to declare the epidemic, and that the National CDC and local CDC authorities had no authority to release the outbreak.
CDC是决策支持机构，但无权决策。
The CDC is the decision support agency, but not the decision maker.
一位疾控从业者对于CDC的尴尬处境很有感触。
A disease control practitioner was struck by the embarrassment of the CDC.
他说：与前线医生相比，CDC没有处方权，说组织协调，CDC又没有命令权。
The CDC has no enforcement power over the front-line doctors, says CDC, which has no command over the organisation, he said.
CDC能做的，就是配合上级指令做好疾病防控，在实验室里做文章。
What CDC can do is to cooperate with superior orders to do disease prevention and control, in the laboratory.
疾病控制住了，大家的焦点都在前线医生身上，疾病没控制住，板子又打到CDC身上。
The disease was under control, the focus was on the front-line doctor, the disease got out of hand, and the board hit the CDC again.
从2003年成立伊始的风光无限，到2020年遭遇“群殴”，中国疾控到底发生了什么？2月18日，武汉客厅方舱医院的洗漱间风雨棚里，一位被隔离的轻症患者正在泡脚。
What happened to disease control in China from the start of its inception in 2003 to a "group fight" in 2020? On Feb. 18, a quarantined light patient soaked in a bathroom shed at Wuhan's living room's Fang Cao Hospital.
摄影/长江日报 陈卓实质的退步2002年，从北京医科大学（现北京大学医学部）预防医学专业毕业后，徐晓奇来到了北京市崇文区疾控中心工作。
After graduating in Preventive Medicine from Beijing Medical University (now Beijing University Medical Department) in 2002, Xu Xiaochi came to work at the CDC in Chongwen District of Beijing.
那时候，这里还不叫疾控中心，它有一个“老古董”的名字，叫崇文区卫生防疫站。
Back then, it wasn't called the CDC. It had the name "Old Antique" and was called Chongwen District Sanitary and Prevention Station.
卫生防疫站体系始于1953年，1990年代以后增加了慢性病防控，但最核心的工作是传染病防治和疫苗接种。
The system of sanitary and epidemiological stations began in 1953, and the prevention and control of chronic diseases has increased since the 1990s, but the most central tasks are the prevention and control of infectious diseases and vaccination.
防疫站有两大职能，一是与健康相关的疾病监测、控制、宣传等，另一部分是行政监督的工作，比如发放卫生许可证。
The two main functions of epidemic prevention stations are, first, to monitor, control and publicize diseases related to health, and secondly, to provide administrative supervision, such as issuing health permits.
但在2003年，这里更名为崇文区疾病预防控制中心，卫生防疫站的职能一分为二，与健康有关的工作留在疾控中心，卫生执法、行政监督的工作则划到了卫生监督所。
In 2003, however, the name was changed to Chongwen District Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the functions of the Sanitary Centers were split into two, the health-related work remained at the CDC, and the work of health law enforcement and administrative supervision was transferred to the Sanitary Supervision Center.
这轮改革始于2001年。
This round of reforms began in 2001.
那一年，国家卫生部办公厅下发了《关于疾病预防控制体制改革的指导意见》，明确了各级疾病预防控制机构的职能与任务，将原省、地（市）、县卫生防疫站被赋予的卫生执法、监督功能整体划出，有关卫生事业单位中的疾病预防控制、公共卫生技术管理和服务职能集中，增加了预防控制慢性病等功能，卫生防疫站更名为疾病预防控制中心，疾控中心的行政权自此被分割出去。
In that year, the General Office of the Ministry of Health issued the Guidelines on the Institutional Reform of Disease Prevention and Control, which defines the functions and tasks of disease prevention and control agencies at all levels, outlines the functions of health law enforcement and supervision entrusted to provincial, prefectural (city) and county health and epidemic prevention stations.
从中国疾病预防控制中心成立的那一天开始，这个机构就先天不足。
Since the establishment of the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the organization has been lacking in talent.
李立明解释说，从最初成立开始，CDC就是国家卫生部直属事业单位，没有行政权。
Li explained that since its inception, the CDC is an institution directly under the Ministry of Health and has no executive power.
国家卫健委下面还有一个疾病预防控制局，是行政部门，中国疾病预防控制中心则是业务部门。
The State Health Commission also has a disease prevention and control bureau, which is the administrative department, and the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is the operational department.
“当时，我们已启动卫生部疾控局与国家CDC整合的方案研讨，也已与中编办进入论证阶段，后因SARS疫情而停止了。
"At the time, we started a program discussion between the CDC of the Ministry of Health and the National CDC.
”李立明回忆说。
"he recalls.
这一停滞，造成了CDC在此后数年里的进一步倒退。
This stagnation caused the CDC to regress further in subsequent years.
在崇文区疾控中心时，因有疫苗销售的大头收入，徐晓奇的工资有时能到一万多。
At the CDC in Chongwen District, Xu earned more than 10,000 yuan in wages, thanks to the bulk of his vaccine sales.
后来，他调至国家疾控中心工作，尽管已是中级职称，2010年时的月工资反而降了6000多元。
He was later transferred to the CDC, where his monthly salary fell by more than 6,000 yuan in 2010, despite his intermediate job title.
这是因为，2012年，国务院推行事业单位改革。
This is because, in 2012, the State Council introduced institutional reform.
义务教育、基础科研与公卫等提供基本服务的事业单位划分为公益一类。
Institutions providing basic services such as compulsory education, basic scientific research and public health are classified as public welfare.
李立明解释说，“公益一类”就是国家给什么钱就用什么钱，完成国家疾控任务，不允许开展服务性的、收费的项目。
Li Liming explained that the "public welfare category" is what the state gives money to complete the national disease control tasks, not allowed to carry out service-oriented, fee-based projects.
“原来中国预防医学科学院（中疾控前身）是公益二类，国家是差额补助，剩下的钱可以自己去挣，比如靠体检、社会检测服务挣些钱，发绩效工资，能对大家的积极性有一个保障。
"It turns out that the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine (formerly known as CDC) is a public good. The state is a subsidy for the difference, and the rest of the money can be earned on its own, such as medical check-ups, social testing services, performance pay and a guarantee of enthusiasm.
”除了收入陡降，CDC的职称晋升也按编制比例被严格限定，晋升通道也堵死了。
In addition to the steep drop in revenues, CDC's job-title promotions were strictly regulated by staffing ratios, and career paths were blocked.
那几年，徐晓奇感到身边离开的人越来越多，而他也在2014年跳槽去了企业。
In those years, Mr. Xu felt more and more people were leaving, and he also moved to a business in 2014.
对此，中国疾病预防控制中心流行病学首席科学家曾光指出，近三年来，仅国家疾控中心流失的中青年骨干就有百人之多。
Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist at the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pointed out that in the past three years, the CDC alone has lost hundreds of young and middle-aged cadres.
他还透露说，近些年，北大医学部、复旦大学上海医学院公共卫生学院的毕业生，到疾控系统来工作的只有2％，愿意选择这里的多数不是重点院校毕业生。
He also revealed that in recent years, only 2 percent of graduates from the Beijing University Medical Department and Shanghai Medical School of Fudan University had worked in the disease control system.
“但实际上，我们需要的人才是高素质的，要了解国内外动态并且有很强的事业心。
"But in reality, we need high-quality people who understand the dynamics at home and abroad and have a strong ambition.
”不仅疾控从业队伍缺乏稳定性，公卫的人才储备也境况堪忧。
Not only does the CDC lack stability, but the public health talent pool is also in dire straits.
中山大学公共卫生学院院长郝元涛告诉《中国新闻周刊》，近些年，第一志愿报考预防医学专业的同学，所占比例最高也不超过30%～40%，有不少都是调剂过来的。
Hao Yuan-tao, dean of the School of Public Health at Zhongshan University, told China News Weekly that in recent years, the proportion of students who volunteered to take preventive medicine courses did not exceed 30 to 40 percent.
此外，预防医学专业的优秀毕业生选择疾控机构的很少，他们宁可去医院做院感、科研或者去一些相关的辅助科室。
In addition, few top preventive medicine graduates choose CDC facilities, preferring to go to hospitals for hospital visits, scientific research or related support services.
王宇曾表示，虽然在理论上，全民健康被放到一切的优先和一切的基础，但在实践中，还难以见到落实的踪影。
Wang has said that, while in theory national health is a top priority and the basis for everything, in practice it is difficult to see implementation.
以财政支出为例，四川大学华西公共卫生学院原党委书记曾诚指出，2014年，国家“公共卫生专项任务经费”的项目拨款为5.29亿，而到了2019年，这笔预算下降到4.5亿，同比下降14.9％。
Taking fiscal spending as an example, Zeng Cheng, a former party secretary at the West China School of Public Health at Sichuan University, noted that in 2014, the national allocation for public health-related tasks was 529 million, but by 2019 it had dropped to 450 million, a 14.9 percent decrease from the previous year.
2019年4月，全国人大常委会副委员长陈竺提出，要高度重视疾病预防控制体系职能在事业单位改革中被弱化的风险。
In April 2019, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Chen Zhu said that great importance should be attached to the risk of weakening the functions of disease prevention and control systems in public institutions.
他的报告同时指出，重医疗轻公卫的倾向一直没有能够得到纠正，公卫医师数量不足且呈逐年减少趋势，人才队伍相对薄弱，与“预防为主”的方针不匹配。
His report also points out that the tendency of heavy medical light guards has not been corrected, that the number of public health doctors is insufficient and decreasing year by year, that the human resources are relatively weak, and that the "prevention-oriented" approach does not match.
一个典型的例子是辽宁省2018年的疾控改革。
A typical example is the 2018 CDC reform in Liaoning Province.
在省级层面，辽宁省疾控中心得以保留，但地市级层面却出现了不同的整合方案，比如，在沈阳市，疾控中心与卫生监督所等机构被整合为市卫生健康服务与行政执法中心；但在抚顺市，疾控中心并入市大健康产业研究院。
At the provincial level, the Liaoning CDC has been maintained, but there are different integration schemes at the local and municipal levels. In Shenyang, for example, the CDC and HHSI have been integrated into the Municipal Health Service and Administrative Enforcement Center.
对此，汪华就表示，“现在大家都在怪CDC，就像疫苗一出事，要追责就先把疾控中心的主任撤掉，这是毫无道理的。
"CDC is now being blamed," Wang said. "There is no reason why the CDC director should be removed before anyone is held accountable for an accident with a vaccine.
我们老同志都开玩笑说，还不如回到原来的防疫站，那时候监督和监测职能放在一起。
Our old comrades all joked that it would be better to go back to the original anti-epidemic station, when the supervisory and monitoring functions were put together.
现在行政管理权没有了，什么事情都要看同级的卫生行政部门怎么决策。
Now that the administration is gone, everything depends on how the health authorities at the same level make decisions.
”2017年，国家CDC主任王宇在研究生毕业典礼致辞时也不无伤感地表示，“大家毕业的时机，有些生不逢时，没有新发传染病出现，也没有突发公共卫生事件——也正因此，‘公共卫生’‘疾病预防控制’，逐渐被社会遗忘了。
In his 2017 graduate graduation speech, Wang Yu, the country's CDC director, lamented: "Graduation comes at a time when there are no new infections or public health emergencies - and public health 'disease prevention and control' is being forgotten.
这应了‘飞鸟尽，良弓藏’的老话，派不上用场的时间久了，人们就忘记了。
This is an old saying of 'All birds, all good bows hide'. People forget when they don't use it for long.
”2月19日，武汉协和医院西院，两名护士艰难拖着病床上的一位重病患者前往CT室做检查。
On Feb. 19, two nurses dragged a seriously ill patient from a hospital bed to a CT scan in the western courtyard of Wuhan Concorde Hospital.
摄影/北京日报 和冠欣改革体制，但不仅仅是体制“在全世界很多国家，卫生部的英文名字就叫Ministry of Public Health，就是公共健康部。
In many countries around the world, the English name of the Ministry of Health is the Ministry of Public Health.
但我们国家原卫生部的英文名字叫 Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China，把public给去掉了。
But the English name of our former health department, Ministry of Health of the People & apos; s Republic of China, removed public.
实际上，国家卫生行政主管部门的职能，就应该是公共卫生即公众健康的管理。
Indeed, the function of the national health administration should be the management of public health, that is, public health.
”李立明如是说。
"said Li Liming.
但实际上，中国的卫生管理部门将绝大部分重心放在了医疗机构的管理上。
In practice, however, China's health authorities focus overwhelmingly on the management of medical institutions.
李立明强调说，体制的改革并非是破解当前中国公卫体系局面的全部密码，在改革体制的同时，更重要的是观念的转变问题。
Li stressed that the reform of the system is not the only key to unlocking the current situation of China's public health system.
在学界，公共卫生的定义是通过有组织的社会努力来预防疾病、延长寿命、促进身心健康和效率的科学和艺术。
In academia, public health is defined as the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life, promoting physical and mental health and efficiency through organized social efforts.
狭义的公共卫生即指疾病的预防控制，其支撑学科是流行病学。
The narrow sense of public health refers to the disease prevention and control, its supporting discipline is epidemiology.
美国CDC前主任费和平（Tom Frieden）近日撰文指出，公共卫生，而不是医疗服务，在过去的20世纪里承担起了世界健康最大的责任，这些措施范围广泛，包括控烟、疫苗、洁净用水等等。
A recent article by Tom Frieden, a former director of the US CDC, argues that public health, rather than health services, has taken on the world's greatest responsibility for health over the past century, with a wide range of measures, including tobacco control, vaccines, and clean water.
然而，一位流行病学教授开玩笑说，公卫领域从业者生活在悖论里：消灭了某种疾病，自己也就失去了存在的价值。
However, an epidemiologist joked that public health practitioners live in a paradox: by eliminating a disease, they lose the value of their existence.
李立明也很强烈地感受到这种规律，“预防医学、公共卫生实际上是一个‘自毁长城’的队伍，你的预防工作做得越好，就越得不到社会和政府部门的重视。
"Preventive medicine, public health is really a team that destroys the Great Wall. The better you do prevention, the less attention you get from society and government.
”费和平认为，要实现各个层级的公共卫生组织的效率最大化，最重要的五个要素包括：足够的资金、数量充足且优质的人才、与其他医疗机构实体之间紧密的联系、有效的沟通以及政治支持下的技术独立。
Fei argues that the five most important elements for maximizing the efficiency of public health organizations at all levels include adequate funding, sufficient and high-quality personnel, close links with other health-care entities, effective communication, and technical independence with political support.
对于最后一点，费和平解释说，美国CDC是离总统只有两步之遥的联邦机构（中间隔着卫生部长——编者注），有相当大的独立行动自由，疾控中心的技术专长在美国和全球、政府内外都受到尊重。
On this last point, Fei explained that the US CDC is a federal agency only two steps away from the president (separated by the Secretary of Health - the Editor's Note), with considerable independent freedom of action, and that CDC's technical expertise is respected in the United States and globally, within and outside the government.
他表示，“作为CDC主任，在关键的卫生问题上，我曾向奥巴马总统汇报。
"As CDC director, I have reported to President Obama on key health issues," he said.
这种与政府最高层直接接触的方式赋予了美国CDC权力，并确保公共卫生在国家层面得到优先重视。
This direct engagement with the highest levels of government empowers the United States CDC and ensures that public health receives priority at the national level.
如何改革体制？多位公卫专家的想法是一定要给予疾控机构以行政权力。
How to reform the system? The idea of many public health experts is to give the CDC administrative power.
就像消防一样，在疫情的处置中，有自己的决定权、处置权。
Like fire fighting, in the disposal of epidemic situation, have their own decision-making power, discretion.
对此，李立明形象地比喻说，“不可能高楼救火，我开着车到那一看，先请示上级说我们有什么方案，等上级批了我们再去救火吧？”具体来说，他希望，疾控体制的改革可以参考现在的中医药管理局与药监局，将来中疾控归国务院直属管理，建成一个具有行政管理和专业技术支撑的国家疾控管理局，进一步加强疾控部门在处理公共卫生事务中的角色与职能。
In particular, he hopes that the reform of the CDC system will refer to the current Chinese Medicine Administration and Drug Administration, and establish a national disease control authority with administrative and professional support to further strengthen the role and functions of disease control departments in handling public health affairs.
美国加州大学洛杉矶分校（UCLA）公共卫生学院副院长、流行病学资深终身教授张作风对《中国新闻周刊》表示，在中国，疾病预防控制中心这些年来的经费是不断下降的，因为是事业单位，也没有办法从其他地方有收入，疾控人员的收入也大大下降。
Zhang style, vice dean and senior professor of epidemiology at the University of California Los Angeles School of Public Health, told China News that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in China has seen a steady decline in funding over the years because it is an institution with no other source of income, and the income of disease controllers has fallen dramatically.
“所以很多疾控中心比较出色的年轻人才外流了， 这样一支队伍是不是能够有效地控制疫情，还是有一些疑问的。
"So many of the CDC's better young brain drain, and it's questionable whether such a team can effectively control the epidemic.
”张作风认为，要加强公共卫生体系建设，很重要的一点，要把疾控系统变成一个独立的系统，和美国疾控中心一样。
Zhang believes it is important to turn the disease control system into a stand-alone system, like the CDC, to strengthen public health.
“美国疾控中心，第一，可以向外发布数据，第二，有权宣布紧急状态，来开始进行疾病防控。
"The CDC, first, can release data outwards, and secondly, the right to declare a state of emergency to begin disease control.
所以我建议把疾控系统纳入政府轨道，变成一个独立的政府系统，由疾控中心来负责急性传染病和慢性病的控制，这样可以抓住时机，及时动作，可以把疾病消灭在最开始时的萌芽状态。
So I suggest that the disease control system be integrated into the government track and become an independent system of government, with the CDC in charge of acute infectious and chronic disease control, so that the timing and timely action can be taken to eliminate the disease in its initial germination.
”安徽省疾控中心原主任任军表示，疾控有很好的传统，不能轻易放弃。
Ren Jun, former director of the CDC in Anhui province, said the disease had a good tradition and should not be given up easily.
比如，过去有一条规定是，疾控单位的一把手，必须是公共卫生专业本科毕业的专业人才。
For example, there used to be a rule that the head of a disease control unit must be a professional with an undergraduate degree in public health.
但现在好像又没有坚持这个规定了。
But I don't seem to be sticking to that rule anymore.
“这次疫情里，现场处理了好多干部。
"In this outbreak, a lot of cadres were handled on the spot.
其实很多地方的卫健委，一把手、二把手都没有医学背景，也没有公共卫生教育背景，这是我很吃惊的，因为这是一个需要强有力的专业知识支撑的岗位。
In fact, I am surprised that many places have no medical background, no medical background, no public health education background, because this is a position that needs strong professional knowledge.
”复旦大学公共卫生学院原院长、流行病学教授姜庆五说，湖北疫情早期的各种问题，都与这种“不是专业的人却在做专业的事”的现象有一定关系。

“据我了解，美国医学院校里的医学博士（MD）中约有四分之一拥有MPH学位，体现了对公共卫生专业的重视和在美国卫生保健系统中的地位和作用，公共卫生专业其实是一个比较普及的职业教育。
