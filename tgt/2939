口述实录·火线养兵千日用在一时，大型公共卫生事件一发生，这些关键的“苦”学科就会为国计民生，甚至民族存亡提供重要保障。
When major public health events occur, these key "bitter" disciplines will provide an important guarantee for people's livelihood and even the survival of the nation.
记者｜黄 祺武汉新冠肺炎的救治压力趋缓，无论是普通市民还是医护人员，都期待着疫情彻底结束的这一天早点到来。
The pressure of treating Wuhan's new crown pneumonia is easing, and both ordinary citizens and medical workers are expecting the day when the epidemic is finally over.
复旦大学附属华山医院先后派出四支援鄂医疗队在武汉各家医疗机构工作，273人的精锐医疗力量，已经在武汉奋战一个多月。
The Huashan Hospital, affiliated with Fudan University, has sent four medical teams to support medical institutions in Wuhan.
华山医院援鄂医疗队部分队员在武汉合影作为华山医院四支援鄂医疗队的总指挥，华山医院副院长马昕曾于2月13日接受《新民周刊》专访《方舱医院如何应对“应收尽收”？华山医院援鄂医疗队总指挥马昕答疑》（←点击可看原文），介绍了当时武汉的疫情和救治情况。
wuashan hospital medical team held a group photo in Wuhan as the commander-in-chief of the Huashan Hospital's four-pillar medical team. Ma Xin, vice-president of the Huashan Hospital, gave an interview to Xinmin Weekly on February 13.
20多天后，华山医院医疗队负责的武昌方舱医院和华中科技大学同济医学院附属同济医院光谷院区ICU病房目前的情况如何？亲身参与抗击新冠疫情一个多月后马昕院长有哪些感悟？3月5日下午，马昕副院长再次接受《新民周刊》专访。
After more than 20 days, what is the current situation of the ICU ward in the Kuanggu Hospital of Tongji Hospital attached to Tongji Medical School of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
部分方舱病床已空床病情复杂患者继续治疗或转院华山医院副院长马昕《新民周刊》：武汉已经有部分方舱医院闭舱，华山医院医疗队管理的武昌方舱医院，患者是不是也已经减少？马昕：我们的病人比以前明显减少。
Some cabin beds have been empty beds complicated patients continue treatment or referral to the hospital Ma Xin Huashan Hospital Vice-President Ma Xin: Wuhan has part of the cabin hospital closed, Huashan Hospital medical team under the management of the Wuchang cabin hospital, the number of patients has also decreased?
武昌方舱医院原本有ABC三个区，一个星期以前，B区已经关舱。
Wuchang Fang Hospital originally had ABC three districts, a week ago, Area B had been closed.
之前总共800张床位，现在还有500张床位，而且500张床位也只有200多个病人，有一半其实是空的。
From a total of 800 beds, there are now 500 beds, and there are only over 200 patients with 500 beds, half of whom are actually empty.
华山医院医疗队管理250 张床位，现在患者人数不到100人。
The Huashan Hospital Medical Team, which manages 250 beds, now has fewer than 100 patients.
《新民周刊》：最近不少医院发现出院病人核酸复查阳性的情况，华山医院医疗队管理的病人中是否有这种病人？马昕：出院病人中我们也随访到2名病人核酸检测阳性，但没有症状，这个现象说明，出院后再隔离14天的措施是非常必要的。
Xin Min Weekly: Recently, many hospitals found positive for nucleic acid reexamination of patients discharged from hospital, and whether there was such a patient among the patients managed by the Huashan Hospital Medical Test.We followed up with two patients who tested positive for nucleic acid but did not show any symptoms.
我们注意到这种现象后，也在研究应对的策略。
Having noticed this phenomenon, we are also studying strategies to deal with it.
比如说我们把出院两次核酸检测阴性的标准，提高到三次核酸检测结果阴性才能出院。
For example, we got out of the hospital two times negative nucleic acid test standards, to three times negative nucleic acid test results before being discharged.
目前床位宽松了，可以给患者加一次核酸检测，同时咽拭子取样上也要更加规范，并且加强咽拭子采样方法培训，提高准确率。
At present the bed is relaxed, can add nucleic acid test to the patient, at the same time pharyngeal swab sampling should also be more standardized, and strengthen pharyngeal swabs sampling methods training to improve accuracy.
我们在探索检测三次这个方案，看看是不是能取得更好的效果。
We are exploring the possibility of testing this scheme three times to see if we can achieve better results.
上海的患者出院做了肛拭子检测，可以提高检测的成功率，我们也在积极探索在方舱医院的可行性。
Shanghai patients discharged from the hospital to do anal swab test, can improve the success rate of the test, we are also actively exploring the feasibility of the hospital.
《新民周刊》：还没有出院的病人，病情比较复杂吗？马昕：我们目前没有出院的患者中，有十多位病人经过治疗后核酸检测持续阳性。
Xin Min Weekly: Is it complicated for patients who have not been discharged from hospital Ma Xin: More than a dozen of our patients who have not been discharged from the hospital have been tested positive for nucleic acid.
像这样的病人治疗有难度，我们会考虑将他们转到定点医院继续治疗。
Patients like this are difficult to treat and we will consider referring them to a designated hospital for further treatment.
还有一些是出现并发症的患者，就是说他新冠肺炎病毒核酸检测已经阴性了，但还存在其他并发症，肺部炎症也还存在，我们不会急于让他出院。
There were also patients with complications, that is to say he was negative for his new crown pneumonia nucleic acid test, but there were other complications and inflammation of the lungs, and we were in no hurry to get him out of the hospital.
马昕在方舱医院内《新民周刊》：患者持续减少，医护人员压力是不是减轻很多？马昕：整体来说医护人员工作压力稍微轻松一点，但这个时候无论是患者治疗还是医护人员自身防护上特别不能掉以轻心。
Ma Xin in "Xinmin Weekly" in Fang Cao Hospital: Does the pressure on medical staff decrease a lot due to the continuous decrease of patients? MBA Xin: Overall, the pressure on medical staff is a little easier, but this is a particularly important time for patient treatment and personal protection.
到目前为止华山医院医疗队在武昌方舱医院保持了病人零死亡、医护人员零感染，但是大家工作一个多月了，有的人可能会松懈，觉得这么久了没感染应该没事，比如脱防护服的时候动作比较快，这些松懈的想法和举动都不能有。
So far, the Huashan Hospital Medical Team has maintained zero patient deaths and zero infections among medical staff at Wuchang Fang Hospital. But after more than a month of work, some people may relax and think it's OK to stay uninfected for so long.
“上游”送来重症患者减少治疗效果提升《新民周刊》：光谷院区ICU病房收治的都是危重症患者，新冠肺炎解剖报告公布后，危重症患者救治措施是否有变化？马昕：解剖结论中提到的一些现象，我们在临床救治中已经发现了。
"Upstream" sent to patients with severe illnesses to reduce the effectiveness of treatment: Guanggu courtyard ICU wards are admitted to critically ill patients, after the publication of the autopsy report on patients with critical changes? MBA Xin: Some of the findings mentioned in the autopsy conclusions have been found in clinical treatment.
比如说我们发现病人上呼吸道有很多的粘稠的痰，非常的黏，病人很难咳出来。
For example, we found that the patient's upper respiratory tract has a lot of sticky sputum, so sticky that it is difficult for the patient to cough out.
这跟解剖报告的结论是互为印证的。
This is in contrast to the findings of the autopsy report.
救治手段上，我们已经发现这个病不仅是肺的问题，很多病人都有心脏、肾脏、肝脏的累及，重症病人要做多脏器的治疗。
In terms of treatment, we have found that this disease is not only a lung problem, many patients have heart, kidney, liver involvement, serious patients to do multi-organ treatment.
《新民周刊》：危重症患者救治的压力是否也在减轻？马昕：经过这段时间的救治，ICU里危重症病人比以前要少了，一些危重症患者经过治疗后变成重症，重症再能缓解，就可以转到普通病房去了。
Xin Min Weekly: Is the pressure to treat critically ill patients also lessening? MBA Xin: After this period of treatment, ICU patients are less critical than before, some critically ill patients after treatment into serious illness, can be remission, can be transferred to the general ward.
另一方面是“上游”送来的危重症患者也不像之前那么多了。
On the other hand, the number of critically ill patients "upstream" is not as great as before.
这说明武汉整个救治的体系慢慢理顺，轻症患者得到及时治疗，不会有那么多重症病人出现。
This shows that the whole treatment system in Wuhan slowly straighten out, light patients get timely treatment, there will not be so many serious patients appear.
压力最大的时候，ICU30张床位，27个病人有气管插管，3个上了ECMO,14个做血液透析，这个抢救压力有多大，你可以想象。
At the height of the stress, there were 30 beds in ICU, 27 patients had trachea intubation, 3 had ECMO and 14 had hemodialysis.
2月27日一早，武汉同济医院光谷院区ICU内，病情危重的新冠肺炎患者老程，经过9个昼夜的ECMO技术抢救，成功撤机《新民周刊》：几天前，光谷院区ICU病房里一位ECMO治疗患者成功脱机，他目前情况如何？马昕：第一个ECMO脱机的病人，目前恢复很好，能自主呼吸，神志也很清醒，这两天他就可以去普通病房了。
After 9 days of rescue by ECMO technique, how is he doing with the newly-treated ECMO patient in the ICU ward of Wuhan Tongji Hospital? MBA: A few days ago, an ECMO patient in the ICU ward in Guanggu Prefecture successfully went offline.
接下来还有一位患者，最近也要撤ECMO。
Then there is the patient, who recently had to withdraw ECMO.
能够成功ECMO脱机，非常不容易，难度很大。
It is not easy and difficult to get ECMO offline successfully.
目前成功脱机ECMO的患者还很少。
Few patients are currently successfully offline ECMO.
《新民周刊》：按照目前疫情发展的情况，您认为医疗队的工作何时能告一段落？马昕：我们做医生的总是会把最坏的情况都要考虑到。
Xin Min Weekly: According to the current situation, when do you think the work of the medical team will be over? MBA MBA students always take the worst into consideration.
现在病人数量在往下走，但谁也不能保证什么时候一疏忽，数字就往上跑。
The number of patients is going down now, but no one can guarantee that the numbers will run up every time they slip up.
我们不能掉以轻心，不能太自信。
We cannot be complacent and not too confident.
时时刻刻绷紧这个弦，提高警惕。
Tighten the string at all times, keep your eyes open.
资源要向“苦”专业倾斜教训不能反复成为教训《新民周刊》：在武汉一个多月，对于这一场疫情，您认为哪些经验教训需要总结？马昕：这次疫情的确可以带给我们很多思考。
Resources to "bitter" professional tilt lessons can not repeatedly become a lesson "Xinmin Weekly": in Wuhan more than a month, what do you think the lessons to summarize the experience of this epidemic? MA Xin: This outbreak can really give us a lot of thought.
首先，我认为方舱医院这种应对突发公共卫生事件的形式，在未来要成为城市建设中的战略储备。
First of all, I think that the square cabin hospital in response to public health emergencies, in the future to become a strategic reserve in urban construction.
比如体育场馆、大型场馆，未来在设计和建设时就要考虑是否能随时被征用为避难的或者收治病人的场所。
For example, stadiums, large stadiums, in the future when the design and construction of the need to consider whether can be readily requisitioned as asylum or admission to places.
说到战略储备，还有一个重要的储备就是特殊学科和人才。
When it comes to strategic reserves, another important reserve is special disciplines and talent.
这次疫情中，感染科、呼吸科、重症科等学科和他们拥有的人才，发挥了非常重要的作用，出现这样的疫情或者灾难，这些学科就显得非常重要。
In this case, infectious diseases, respiratory departments, severe diseases and other disciplines and their personnel play a very important role, such as the emergence of such an epidemic or disaster, these disciplines are very important.
这些年，一些医院连感染科都没有了。
Over the years, some hospitals have lost even infection departments.
这些科室工作忙、压力大，收入又不高，很多人不愿意做，有些医院也不愿意发展。
These departments are busy, stressed and poorly paid, and many people are reluctant to do so, and some hospitals are reluctant to develop.
这些科室可能在医院里“不赚钱”。
These departments may not be "profitable" in the hospital.
我们有的时候老想着能出高精尖科研的学科，看重那些特别“炫”的技术。
We sometimes want to be able to come up with cutting-edge scientific research, the emphasis on those particularly "dazzling" technology.
但养兵千日用在一时，大型公共卫生事件一发生，这些关键的“苦”学科就会为国计民生，甚至民族存亡提供重要保障。
But when a major public health event occurs, these key "bitter" disciplines will provide an important guarantee for the livelihood of the country and even the survival of the nation.
所以说医院要将资源向这些学科倾斜，国家更要向这些学科倾斜。
So hospitals should direct their resources to these disciplines, and the state should give preference to these disciplines.
2019年10月华山医院演练接诊呼吸道传染病患者《新民周刊》：“养兵千日，用兵一时”，医疗体系平常还要做哪些准备？马昕：应对大型疫情和灾难，医院要做好流程管理。
October 2019 Huashan Hospital Rehearsal Respiratory Infectious Disease Patients "Xinmin Weekly": "Nurture thousands of days, use military time," what should the medical system usually do? MBA: To cope with large-scale epidemic and disaster, the hospital should do well in the process management.
去年10月进行了一次大型传染病疫情应对的演练，这个活动我们每年都搞。
Last October we had a major pandemic preparedness drill, which we do every year.
但我知道不是每家医院都有这种演练，我认为每家医院都应该做。
But I know not every hospital has this kind of drill, I think every hospital should do it.
说起来特别巧，我们10月的演练，模拟的就是一名从国外回来的病人发烧到医院就诊，医生怀疑他是一种输入性传染病的患者，我们急诊的预检护士发现这个问题，马上引导他到发热门诊，医生护士穿上防护服，对病人进行检查。
As it happens, our October drill simulated a patient returning from a foreign country with a fever and the doctor suspected him of being a patient with an imported sexually transmitted disease. Our emergency pre-screening nurse found the problem and directed him to the fever clinic immediately.
医护人员把病人送到放射科，进行影像检测，检验科对他的相关标本也同时进行检测，发现问题后马上送病人到感染科的负压病房。
The patient was sent to the radiology department for imaging examination, and the relevant specimens were also examined at the same time. Problems were immediately detected and sent to the negative pressure ward of the Infection Department.
我是这次演练的总指挥，我记得当时我的同事举个牌子，上面写着“疫情演练”，怕旁边围观的群众误会紧张。
I was the commander-in-chief of the drill, and I remember that my colleague used a sign that said "epidemic drill" for fear that the crowd around would misunderstand the tension.
两个月后，新冠肺炎疫情就出现了，大家都说我们平日的演练太重要了。
Two months later, the outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia began, and everyone said our daily drills were too important.
因为有这样的演练，华山医院可以放心地派出专家到武汉，张文宏教授可以放心去上海的定点医院，我们自己医院各部门可以按照既定的流程流畅地应对疫情。
Because of such drill, Huashan Hospital can safely send experts to Wuhan, Professor Zhang Wenhong can safely go to the designated hospital in Shanghai, our own hospital departments can follow the established procedures to respond to the epidemic smoothly.
大家对传染病的流程非常熟悉，平时我们的院感管理就很规范，管理流程很成熟，有备才能无患。
We are very familiar with the flow of infectious diseases, usually our hospital management is very standardized, management process is very mature, ready to do not have.
最可怕的是打无准备之仗。
The worst thing is to fight without preparation.
如果平常没有一点准备，疫情来了，大家像无头苍蝇一样，会有很重大的损失，医护人员如果用血肉之躯去扑这个病毒，结果一定是很惨烈的，所以一定要科学防疫。
If there is no ordinary preparation, the outbreak came, people like headless flies, there will be very heavy losses, if the medical staff with blood to attack the virus, the results must be very fierce, so must scientific epidemic prevention.
《新民周刊》：医院感控专业，在疫情中起到什么作用？马昕：华山医院医疗队首先就要有医院感控管理专家，他们是我们其他医护人员的“保护神”。
Xin Min Weekly: What role does the hospital sensuous control specialty play in the epidemic? MBA Xin: Huashan Hospital Medical Team must first have the hospital sensuous management experts, they are the "protectors" of our other medical personnel.
他们就像是排雷专家，只有感控管理专家知道地雷在哪儿，他们会给我们规划好安全的前进路径，让我们科学地对抗疫情，步步为营，稳妥地往前走。
They are like mine clearance experts. Only a sensory management expert knows where the mine is. They will give us a safe way forward, so that we can confront the epidemic scientifically, step by step, and move steadily forward.
刚才国家卫健委的领导到光谷院区视察，对华山医院医疗队给予了非常高的评价，这些成绩都是我们平常的培训、平常的管理和技术水平的体现。
Just now the leader of the national health committee visited the Guanggu courtyard district and gave a very high evaluation to the medical team of Huashan Hospital. These achievements are the reflection of our ordinary training, ordinary management and technical level.
武汉新冠肺炎救治的很多经验，回去要好好总结，应该写进教科书。
Wuhan new crown pneumonia treatment of many experiences, back to a good summary, should be written into textbooks.
马昕与同济医院同道合影，新冠肺炎疫情中，湖北医护人员有3000多人感染《新民周刊》：新冠肺炎疫情，让患者和社会承受了巨大的损失，您自己有哪些感触？马昕：我们有很多的经验也有很多的教训，教训不能反复成为教训，我们最好在不断总结经验中成长，而不是通过惨痛的教训来进步。
MBA students from Hubei Province have been infected with Xinmin Weekly during the Xinguan Pneumonia outbreak, which has caused great losses to the patients and the society. MBA Xin: We have many experiences and many lessons.
这次疫情中，有很多家族性的感染，典型的聚集性传染，一家人都生病了，太影响一个家庭的幸福了，这让人非常痛心。
In this case, there are a lot of familial infections, typical concentrated infections, family members are ill, too much to affect the well-being of a family, which is very painful.
征集令阳春三月，万物复苏。
