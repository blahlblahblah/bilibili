TOKYO-CHENGDU, with a million face masks donated by Japanese civilians, has arrived at Chengdu's Shuangliu International Airport and is being rushed to Wuhan by air, according to a report from Sichuan Airlines.
新型冠状病毒肺炎的蔓延，让日本零售市场口罩成交量也剧增。
The spread of the new coronavirus pneumonia has led to a surge in turnover of masks in the Japanese retail market.
这个口罩大国的制造商正加紧生产：1月17日起，尤妮佳由正常工作时间生产，改为24小时生产；总部在日本仙台的厂商Iris Ohyama在春节前一周的订单是之前的三倍，其中国工厂也加紧了生产。
Manufacturers of the mask-rich country are ramping up production: from normal working hours on January 17, Yunani Jia switched to 24-hour production; Sendai-based firm Iris Ohyama tripled its order in the week before the Spring Festival and its Chinese factories stepped up production.
2000年之后，无纺布口罩逐渐取代了纱布口罩。
After 2000, the non-woven mask gradually replaced the gauze mask.
之后，每隔数年就出现的传染性疾病，非典、禽流感、埃博拉、中东呼吸综合症等，加速了日本相关科技的研发。
Since then, infectious diseases, such as SARS, avian influenza, Ebola, and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, which occur every few years, have accelerated research and development in Japan.
从工业品到家用产品，日本口罩产业近年发展迅速，各种功能、样式的口罩涌现；在消费端，日常佩戴口罩成了很多日本居民的习惯。
From industrial products to household products, the Japanese mask industry has grown rapidly in recent years, with various functions and styles emerging. On the consumer side, daily wearing of masks has become a habit of many Japanese residents.
口罩依赖症之国日本一便利店口罩货架外国人初到日本机场，就能看到很多人戴口罩；在超市和药妆店，也有各种不同功效的口罩在售。
A Japanese convenience store mask shelf When foreigners first arrive at Japan's airports, they see many wearing masks, and in supermarkets and makeup shops, masks of varying efficacy are on sale.
2019年8月27日，日本《朝日新闻》报道就指出，日本家庭用口罩的销量接连上涨，预计2019年的口罩销量将会超过2009年出现新型流感之时。
On Aug. 27, 2019, Japan's Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported that sales of Japanese household masks have been on the rise, and sales are expected to exceed those for the new flu in 2009.
根据调查公司富士经济的数据，2009年全球流感大爆发时，日本口罩的销售额比上年翻了一倍，达到340亿日元（约合23亿元人民币）。
When the global flu pandemic broke out in 2009, sales of Japanese masks doubled from a year earlier to 34 billion yen (2.3 billion yuan), according to research firm Fuji Economy.
流感之后，日本口罩销售额回落，但处于逐年增长的趋势，预计2019年口罩销售额将达到370亿日元（约合25亿元人民币）。
After the flu, sales of Japanese masks fell, but are growing year by year, with sales expected to reach Y37bn (2.5 billion yuan) in 2019.
专栏作家中岛惠曾在中国留学，她专门总结过日本的口罩现象。
Columnist Nakajima, who studied in China, made a special summary of the Japanese mask phenomenon.
她在大型药房观察，发现经常有30-40种口罩在售，尺寸从特大、大、中、小，到不同年龄儿童用、女性用等；按用途来看，有使眼镜不模糊的口罩、不沾口红的口罩、让脸看起来更瘦的口罩、容易呼吸的口罩、防范花粉症的口罩、抗菌口罩、防PM2.5的口罩等等；还带有各种颜色、香味和卡通图案。
She looked at large pharmacies and found that 30-40 kinds of masks were often on sale, ranging in size from large, large, medium and small to children and women of all ages. By purpose, there were masks that kept glasses from blurring, lipstick masks, face-thin masks, easy-to-breathe masks, anti-hay masks, antibacterial masks, PM2.5 masks, etc.
她总结口罩在日本普及率如此之高，原因在于这几点：其一，不少人把口罩时尚单品使用，戴上口罩可以遮掩不化妆的脸，或让脸部线条看起来更漂亮；其二，遮挡脸部似乎更能隐藏自己，与别人保持距离，符合不少日本人腼腆的个性；其三，口罩最原始的功能：防止感冒等疾病传播，防止被他人传染感冒，在自己稍微有点感冒时，也不给别人添麻烦；第四，很多日本人有花粉过敏症状，看不到的花粉会困扰人们几个月之久，流眼泪加打喷嚏，口罩是很好的防护。
For one thing, many people wear masks to mask their non-make-up face or make their face look more beautiful. Second, masks seem to conceal themselves from others and keep them from catching colds. And thirdly, many Japanese have pollen allergies that can be seen for months.
产品丰富产业发达消费者对口罩的依赖，让相关技术、公司、产业得以发展。
The product enriches the industry developed consumer to the mask dependence, lets the related technology, the company, the industry to develop.
2015年，人气很旺的花样滑冰选手羽生结弦抵达上海比赛时，戴了一款印有日本国旗的口罩，那就是专门防范花粉症的口罩。
A popular figure skater arrived in Shanghai in 2015 wearing a mask bearing the Japanese flag, a mask designed to protect against hay fever.
这种叫Pittarich的高性能口罩有8层滤网，可阻挡细菌、PM2.5等侵入，层层防护却又透气，戴起来清凉不闷热，洗净后还可重复使用。
The high-performance mask, called Pittarich, has eight layers of filters that block bacteria, PM2.5s and other intrusions, but are breathable, cool and not sultry when worn, and can be re-used after washing.
羽生结弦当时羽生结弦因为违法日本滑联的穿戴纪律被警告，但这款高价（六七百元人民币）的口罩一下子火了。
Feather strings were warned of breaking the Japanese Sliding Union's dress code, but the high-priced (Rmb6, 700) mask went off at once.
生产这种口罩的是爱知县的医疗用品制造商CLEVER公司。
The mask is manufactured by CLEVER, a medical supplies manufacturer in Aichi prefecture.
中东呼吸综合症在韩国爆发时，CLEVER公司的专业防护口罩又火了一把，订单供不应求。
When the Middle East respiratory syndrome broke out in South Korea, CLEVER's professional respirator was on fire again, and orders were in short supply.
厂商介绍，Pittarich口罩工艺复杂，完成一个需要一个半小时，通常一天只能生产1000个，因此单价较高。
The company says the Pittarich mask process is complex and takes an hour and a half to complete, often producing only 1,000 a day, so the unit price is high.
上市公司兴研株式会社（KOKEN LTD.）有70多年历史，以前是从事工业防尘口罩业务的，2013年时进入普通家庭口罩市场，契机是雾霾PM2.5的发生，他们的工业防尘口罩可阻隔粒径不到PM2.5二十五分之一的微细粒子，当时订单暴增。
A 70-year-old company formerly involved in industrial dust masks, KOKEN LTD. entered the general household mask market in 2013 with a haze of PM2.5, whose industrial dust masks block tiny particles with a particle size of less than one-quarter of PM2.5s, when orders surged.
Pitta Mask是随明星街拍被带火的产品，厂商是名古屋的ARAX，产品特色是用柔软的聚氨酯材质做成，可多次清洗，色彩也丰富。
Pitta Mask is a fire-carrying product from Star Street, Nagoya's ARAX, made of soft polyurethane material that can be washed many times and in rich color.
虽然这款产品不防雾霾只防尘防花粉，但颜值高，消费者尤其喜爱，也是代购抢手货。
Although this product is only dust-proof and anti-pollen, but high in color, consumers especially love, is also a buying agent.
日本口罩等防护、护理产品产业发达，不乏上市公司。
Japan masks and other protective, nursing products industry developed, there are no lack of listed companies.
2020年1月16日，日本厚生劳动省确认首例新型肺炎后，兴研株式会社等医疗器材相关企业股价大涨，当天上午口罩生产商Shikibo、大和纺控股、兴研、重松制造所股价就分别上涨2.65%、4.82%、3.88%和7.43%。
On January 16, 2020, after the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare confirmed the first case of new pneumonia, shares in medical equipment-related companies, such as XingResearch Co. Ltd., jumped 2.65 percent, 4.82 percent, 3.88 percent and 7.43 percent, respectively, in the morning for mask makers Shikibo, Dahe spinning Holdings, Xing Research and Chongsong Manufacturing.
黑科技应用口罩有关的黑科技也不断被应用。
Black technology associated with the use of masks is also being used.
日经商业出版、日经技术在线网站就专门介绍过一些。
Japanese commercial publication, the Nikkei technology online site on a number of special presentations.
2009年爆发的新型流感之后，市场开始追求防护能力更强的口罩，许多厂商都着手开发能抑制病毒的物质，利用儿茶酚的抗菌能力就是一例。
In the wake of the new flu outbreak in 2009, the market has sought more protective masks, and many manufacturers have started to develop antiviral agents, such as catechins.
大坂大学产业科学研究所和初创企业PROTECTEA开发了一款高功能口罩，特点是迭加了4层网眼细密的滤芯，其中1层含有绿茶中的儿茶酚成分。
The Institute of Industrial Sciences at Osaka University and the start-up PROTECTOA have developed a high-powered mask featuring four layers of mesh finely filtered cores, one of which contains catechins from green tea.
有研究说用绿茶漱口可以预防感冒，该公司由此得到启发，想到使儿茶酚成分渗入无纺布，从而抑制附着的病毒的方法。
The company has been inspired by research suggesting that using green tea mouthwashes can help ward off colds, suggesting ways to make catechins seep into nonwoven fabrics, thereby inhibiting attached viruses.
大坂大学产业科学研究所学者开发邦宏负责这一项目。
Bong Hong, a scholar at Osaka University's Institute of Industrial Sciences, is responsible for the project.
灵感来自他在英国留学的时候，曾将喝完的茶叶放到窗台上晾干，结果发现红茶会发霉，而绿茶不会。
When he studied in the UK, he dried the tea leaves on the windowsill, only to find black tea mouldy but green tea not.
技术用在口罩上并不容易：儿茶酚如果只是简单地涂在口罩上，很难与病毒发生反应。
The technology isn't easy to use on masks: catechins are hard to react to if they are simply applied to a mask.
儿茶酚会反复与病毒表面的蛋白质结合、分离，起不到抑制病毒的效果。
Catechin will repeatedly bind to the surface of the virus protein, isolation, can not suppress the virus effect.
开发邦宏想办法让儿茶酚与脂肪酸结合，制作出了CateProtect，它能缠住病毒表面的膜，使膜失去功能，破坏病毒，使之失去传染能力。
Development Bond has devised a way to bind catechins to fatty acids, creating CateProtect, which can bind membranes around the virus's surface, rendering it dysfunctional, destroying viruses and rendering them incapable of transmission.
CateProtect在10分钟内，可以使99.9％的流感病毒失活。
CateProtect inactivated 99.9 per cent of the flu virus in 10 minutes.
产品化过程中另一难题是儿茶酚浓度：如果浓度过高，在吸气时会感觉到茶的苦味；而且，儿茶酚的色素还有可能附着在口罩上，导致口罩变成褐色。
Another difficulty in product development is catechin concentration: if the concentration is too high, the bitter taste of the tea will be felt when inhaled; and catechin pigments may also attach to the mask, causing it to turn brown.
经过5年，该公司才终于开发出了可以正常呼吸、不会破坏外观、浓度刚好的儿茶酚溶液。
It took five years for the company to develop a catechin solution that would breathe normally, without damaging its appearance and in just the right concentration.
黑科技之二是利用鸵鸟蛋量产生抗体。
The second is the use of ostrich eggs to produce antibodies.
日本福冈县的CROSSEED公司开发的口罩，滤芯中含有鸵鸟体内生成的抗体。
The mask developed by CROSSEED in Fukuoka Prefecture contains antibodies produced in ostriches.
这是与京都府立大学生命环境科学研究院塚本康浩教授合作的产品。
This is a collaboration with Professor Benkang Ho, Professor of Life Environment Sciences Research Institute, Kyoto Prefectural University.
鸵鸟抵抗传染病的能力强，体内能高效率产生抗体。
Ostriches resist infectious diseases, the body can efficiently produce antibodies.
塚本康浩教授向鸵鸟投用了季节性流感、禽流感病毒（H5N1型）和诱发花粉症的过敏原物质等。
Professor Benkang Hao buried the ostrich with seasonal influenza, avian influenza virus (H5N1) and anaphylaxis causing hay fever, etc.
流感病毒上有感染人体所必需的“表面突起”,鸵鸟抗体能够覆盖这些突起，抑制病毒。
The influenza virus has the "surface protuberance" necessary to infect the body, and ostrich antibodies can cover these bumps and suppress the virus.
还有企业研发的滤芯网眼的细密程度达到了极致。
Also has the enterprise development filter core mesh's fineness degree has reached the acme.
便宜的无纺布口罩能抵御直径约3微米的微粒，可以滤除花粉，但对PM2.5没什么效果。
Cheap non-woven masks resist particles about 3 microns in diameter and filter out pollen, but have little effect on PM2.5.
ACE INTERNATIONAL JAPAN公司的Morse Mask配备的滤芯能够滤除直径仅为0.1微米的微粒，流感病毒不在话下。
ACE INTERNATIONAL JAPAN's Morse Mask is equipped with a filter that filters particles as small as 0.1 micron in diameter, allowing influenza viruses to be removed.
除了口罩的核心功能在细分、进步，一些小细节也在改善中。
In addition to the mask's core functions in the subdivision, progress, a number of small details are also improving.
比如尤妮佳也开发了给女士的小脸口罩，它让下巴到耳朵的曲线更加圆润、让脸显得更小。
For example, Yunja has developed a face mask for women that makes the curve of her chin to her ears more rounded and her face look smaller.
比如雾霾天气长时间戴口罩耳朵会很不舒服、勒得难受。
For example, wearing a mask for a long time in foggy weather can make your ears feel uncomfortable and strangled.
日本大坂一家叫做MUTUYA的公司就推出了相应的新产品，是一条两端装了挂钩的带子，和口罩配合使用，挂在脑后。
MUTUYA, a company in Osaka, Japan, has come up with a new product, a hooked belt at both ends, used in conjunction with a mask and hung from the back of the head.
口罩的橡皮筋不再接触到耳朵，长时间佩戴会舒服一些；价格折合人民币十元左右。
The rubber band of the mask no longer touches the ear and will be comfortable to wear for a long time; the price is about RMB 10.
