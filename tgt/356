记者/佟晓宇编辑/宋建华会诊中的童朝晖（右一）新型肺炎与SARS有何区别？治疗难度如何？幼儿和青年不易感染？易感人群又存在哪些特征？抗艾滋药对新型肺炎临床治疗真的有效吗？针对新型冠状病毒治疗的一系列问题，1月27日，北青深一度记者采访了正在武汉抗疫一线参加对重症患者救治的北京朝阳医院副院长、呼吸危重症专家童朝晖。
Reporter / Tong Xiaoyu editor / Song Jianhua consultation children Chaohui (right) What is the difference between the new pneumonia and SARS? How difficult is the treatment? Is young children and young people not susceptible to infection?
1月18日，童朝晖同北京协和医院内科重症监护室主任杜斌教授、东南大学附属中大医院邱海波教授作为援助专家一同抵达武汉，重点指导和负责武汉危重症患者的临床救治。
On January 18, Tong Chaohui arrived in Wuhan with Professor Du Bin, director of the intensive care unit of Beijing Concorde Hospital, and Professor Qiu Haibo, an associate of Southeast University Central Hospital.
作为呼吸危重症专家，在2003年非典时，童朝晖曾带领43名医务人员建立北京朝阳区妇幼保健院SARS病房，期间收治近百例患者，无一死亡，被称为“中国顶级SARS病房”。
As a respiratory crisis specialist, in 2003 SARS, child Chaohui led 43 medical personnel to set up the Beijing Chaoyang District Maternal and Child Health Hospital SARS ward, which admitted nearly 100 patients, none of whom died, and was referred to as China's top SARS ward.
持续到午夜的研讨会议、查房，指导重症和危重症患者的治疗，填满了童朝晖现在的每一天。
Continue to midnight discussion meeting, house inspection, guide the treatment of severe and critically ill patients, filled in the child Chaohui every day now.
金银潭医院中的重症监护病房重症患者年龄偏大，多有基础疾病深一度：您到武汉后去了哪几家医院？每天主要的工作是什么？童朝晖：主要是救治重症和危重症患者。
Gold and Silver Pool Hospital in the intensive care unit of severe patients older, more than one degree of underlying disease: you to Wuhan after the several hospitals? What is the main work every day? Tong Chaohui: Mainly for the treatment of severe and critically ill patients.
现在武汉对于重症患者集中收治，主要在金银潭医院、武汉军科医院、武汉大学中南医院。
Wuhan is now receiving intensive care for patients with severe diseases, mainly in the gold and silver pool hospital, Wuhan military hospital, Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital.
我的工作基本在临床上，给这些医院和医生指导，有不合理的地方就指出来。
My work is basically clinical, to these hospitals and doctors guidance, there are unreasonable place to point out.
深一度：临床救治中发现存在哪些问题吗？童朝晖：救治工作没有问题，但是大家对这个疾病的认识、了解不一样，比如说急性呼吸衰竭治疗的把握也不一样。
Deep once: What problems have been found in the clinical treatment? Children Chaohui: There are no problems with the treatment, but people do not understand the disease, such as acute respiratory failure treatment grasp is not the same.
深一度：危重症患者都采取哪些治疗？童朝晖：对于重症和危重症患者有明确定义，按照标准分为重症和危重症，对于重症和危重症的治疗政策也不同，救治按照不同的方式进行，比方说无创呼吸机、有创呼吸机、体外膜肺等。
How to treat critically ill patients? Children Chaohui: There is a clear definition of severe and critically ill patients, according to the standard classification of severe and critically ill patients, and different treatment policies for severe and critical cases, such as non-invasive breathing machines, invasive breathing machines, extracorporeal membranes, etc.
深一度：大家议论的幼儿或青年人不易感，准确吗？童朝晖：是否幼儿和青年不易感，应该说现在没有充足的证据。
Once upon a time: Is it true that young children or young people are not easy to feel? Child Chaohui: Whether young children and young people are not easy to feel, should be said that there is not enough evidence.
当然也不能说小孩易感，这里不能这么讲，深圳就有儿童确诊病例，现在也有年轻人确诊的例子。
Of course, it can not be said that children are susceptible to this, can not be said here, Shenzhen has confirmed cases of children, there are now cases of young people confirmed.
深一度：所谓的易感人群，存在什么样的特征？童朝晖：总体感觉就是，像2003年的SARS的发展，二三十岁的青年人感染的病例会多一些，现在可能五六十岁的人会受到更多的影响，而且这些人往往有一些基础疾病，比如糖尿病、高血压，而且病情往往会重一些。
What are the characteristics of the so-called susceptible peopleChild Chaohui: The overall feeling is that, like the SARS outbreak in 2003, there will be more cases among young people in their 20s and 30s, who may now be more affected in their fifties and sixties, often with basic illnesses such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and often more severe.
深一度：重症患者多存在您上述提到的这些特征是吗？童朝晖：对，年龄偏大。
Deep once: How many of the above-mentioned characteristics do you mention? Tong Chaohui: Yes, age is too high.
深一度：这些重症患者现在治疗会面临一些困难吗？童朝晖：重症患者其实主要还是靠呼吸支持，还有脏器保护，相应这些东西现在我们做的都比较专业。
Once upon a time: Will these patients face some difficulty in getting treatment? TUNG Chaohui: Severe cases are still largely due to respiratory support and viscera protection, and we're doing these things professionally.
应该说跟我们平时治疗那些病毒、肺炎、急性呼吸紧迫综合征，包括当年的SARS，治疗策略都是一样的。
It should be said that we usually treat those viruses, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, including SARS, the treatment strategy is the same.
深一度：重症患者所需的包括呼吸辅助器材现在能保证吗？童朝晖：现在数量是能保证的。
One degree: Is the amount of breathing aids needed by patients with severe illness guaranteed now? Tong Chaohui: Now the quantity is guaranteed.
深一度：上呼吸机和插管这些工作会增加医生的感染风险吗？童朝晖：相比于其他轻症患者来说，对危重症和重症患者插管的过程，可能需要做好完备的防护，插好以后它是个密闭的系统，应该说感染的问题不大。
One degree deep: Does the work of ventilator and intubation increase a doctor's risk of infection? TUNG Chaohui: The process of intubation in critically and critically ill patients may need to be well protected from infection than other light patients.
深一度：武汉周边地区的重症患者收治情况怎样？有相关联防或上报措施吗？童朝晖：每天都有上报，周边地区也会有重症和危重症患者，但重症病人最好还是就地入院治疗，毕竟症状重，对患者而言不太好转移。
Deep once: Wuhan surrounding areas of severe patients how? Related prevention or reporting measures? Tong Chaohui: Every day there are reports, the surrounding areas will have serious and critical patients, but it is best to hospitalize the serious patients, after all the symptoms are heavy, patients are not easy to transfer.
截止1月26日，武汉大学中南医院检验科已完成近1500例样本检测和华大基因签约，第三方介入检测深一度：目前您了解到的医院床位够用吗？童朝晖：对于重症的来说，这些问题一直在调整，包括不同医院分别收治轻症、重症患者，然后现在又再组织建一个新的医院，这些都是积极的改善现状的措施。
As of Jan. 26, the examination department of Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital has completed nearly 1,500 sample tests and signed a contract for Huada gene, and the third-party intervention test has been deep enough.
深一度：对于一线的医生，包括 ICU病房口罩、防护服这些物资使用情况如何？是否够用？童朝晖：重症的定点医院目前还没有问题，但是可能前一段存在这个问题，现在在继续想办法解决。
One degree: How are the supplies being used by front-line doctors, including ICU ward masks, protective clothing? Sufficient? Tong Chaohui: The critical designated hospital is not a problem at present, but there may be a problem in the previous paragraph, and is still trying to solve it.
深一度：是否存在检测难、确诊难的情况？是什么原因引起的？童朝晖：主要是供应不上，一天能做的检测有限，人力上也有问题。
Deep once: Is there a difficult test, diagnosis difficult? What causes? Child Chaohui: Mainly is not available, one day can do limited testing, manpower problems.
现在也在慢慢解决。
And now it's slowly coming out.
深一度：现在试剂盒已经投入使用了，您了解到的它应用的情况怎样？童朝晖：现在尽可能能检测的全部都检测，包括和华大基因签约了，让第三方介入。
Deep once: Now that the kit is in use, what do you know about its application? TUNG Chaohui: Now test everything that can be tested, including signing on to Huada Gene and getting a third party involved.
本身做检测的人手少，需要做采样啊，这些都得有人去做。
The person that does the test oneself is small, need to do sampling ah, these must be done by somebody.
深一度：所以医护人员一直是紧缺的情况？童朝晖：现在全国都在派医疗队，应该说会好的。
Deep once: So the medical staff has been a shortage of the situation? Children Chaohui: Now the whole country is sending medical teams, should be said to be good.
深一度：对于正在筹建的火神山医院等，这些医院的建立对缓解疫情有哪些作用？尤其是对您关注的危重症患者。
Deep once: For the building of the fire god mountain hospital, and so on, the establishment of these hospitals to alleviate the epidemic? Especially for your attention to critically ill patients.
童朝晖：肯定会增加很多床位，专门收治这些冠状病毒肺炎患者，所以说能够缓解其他医院存在的床位不够等情况。
Tong Chaohui: There will definitely be many more beds available to treat these coronavirus pneumonia patients, so it can alleviate the shortage of beds in other hospitals.
当然危重症患者可能还是要由定点医院治疗。
Of course critically ill patients may still have to be hospitalized.
进入病房前的一线救治医疗专家（左二为童朝晖）新型肺炎比SARS治疗难度更大深一度：您此前参与过SARS的防控和救治，二者有什么共性和区别？童朝晖：SARS当年青壮年患者多一些，患新型肺炎的多数有基础疾病，并且五六十岁的患者多一些。
The new type of pneumonia is more difficult to treat than SARS: What are the commonalities and differences between the two treatments? Childhood Chaohui: SARS was more common among young adults, most of whom had basic diseases and had more cases in their fifties and sixties.
所以这两者比，救治起来就显得新型肺炎的难度要大一些，插管比例可能会高一些。
So compared to the two, the new type of pneumonia appears to be more difficult to cure, the proportion of intubation may be higher.
另外，当年SARS是发热，起病比较急，在高热阶段会有传染性。
In addition, SARS was fever that year, the onset of more acute, in the high fever phase will be infectious.
而新型肺炎存在潜伏期，在潜伏期就有传染性，甚至有的也不怎么发烧，看起来没有明显的症状。
But the new pneumonia has latency period, in incubation period is infectious, even some do not feverish, do not seem to have obvious symptoms.
深一度：所以新型肺炎的治疗难度更大？童朝晖：对，新型肺炎80%是和SARS相近，20%是不同的。
One degree: So the new pneumonia is more difficult to treat? Tong Chaohui: Yes, 80% of the new pneumonia is similar to SARS, and 20% is different.
不同的地方就是它变异的地方，跟SARS相比它的临床治疗难度是更大了。
The difference is that it mutates, making it more difficult to treat clinically than SARS.
深一度：SARS的防控和临床治疗有什么经验是新型肺炎可以借鉴的？童朝晖：SRAS包括后面的禽流感、甲流，这些都是病毒肺炎，相应的救治策略，应该说都差不多，包括对现在的新型肺炎，应该说都大同小异。
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS): What are some of the lessons learned from SARS prevention and treatment? SRAS includes avian influenza and influenza A in the rear. These are all viral pneumonia, and the corresponding treatment strategies, which should be said to be the same, including the new pneumonia, should be said to be similar.
主要就是呼吸支持，保证病人呼吸支持，不缺氧，包括脏器保护和其他相应的一些治疗。
Mainly is respiratory support, to ensure that patients breathing support, do not lack oxygen, including organ protection and other appropriate treatment.
事实上危重症呼吸衰竭的治疗，在日常我们就是这么做的。
In fact, the treatment of severe respiratory failure is what we do on a daily basis.
深一度：之前有专家预测感染数量可能会出现拐点，通过您的临床观测，您对疫情的发展有什么预测吗？童朝晖：我不敢预测，因为我是临床医生，主要是诊断救治患者，预测的都是流行病学和CDC（中国疾病预防控制中心）专家，所以应该请他们来回答。
Once upon a time, experts predicted that the number of infections might inflect point, so what do you predict from your clinical observations? Tong Chaohui: I'm afraid to predict it, because I'm a clinician, mainly a diagnostic patient, and I'm forecasting epidemiology and CDC experts, so they should be asked to answer.
深一度：您通过对临床情况的观测，到目前看来重症患者没有减少的趋势？童朝晖：还没有减少的趋势。
One degree: Through your observation of the clinical situation, so far it seems that the trend of serious patients has not decreased? Tong Chaohui: There is no trend to decrease.
艾滋药阻断药有效性待论证深一度：此前有感染病专家称艾滋药阻断药可能对新型肺炎的治疗有效，您怎么看？童朝晖：现在因为都是个体个案，有的是个人经验，没有做一些对照研究，所以很难说是否有效。
What do you think of the effect of blocking drugs for HIV / AIDS It is hard to say whether they are working because they are individual cases, because there are some personal experiences and there are no controlled studies.
因为我们在临床上治疗病人是要有依据的，要有证据。
Because we treat patients clinically on the basis of evidence.
其次，这个药本身它的适应症就没有治疗冠状病毒的适应症，所以我觉得可能还得看一下，不好下结论说它就是有效。
Second, the drug itself has no indication that it is suitable for treating coronavirus, so I think I might have to look at it and conclude that it is effective.
深一度：对普通人您有一些什么防控建议吗？童朝晖：自己要注意，尽量减少去不通风、密闭的环境，包括现在提倡大家戴口罩，跟对呼吸道传染病的要求是一样的。
Once upon a time: What advice do you have for the common man? Child Chaohui: Take care to minimize the exposure to unventilated, closed environments, including the current practice of wearing masks, as required for respiratory infections.
深一度：对于轻症患者您有哪些治疗和防护建议？童朝晖：轻症患者如果没有明显的症状，也不低氧，也没有呼吸道症状，我觉得可以在家里居家隔离。
Deep once: What treatment and protection advice do you have for people with mild illness? Tong Chaohui: If the patient does not have obvious symptoms, nor low oxygen, and no respiratory symptoms, I feel at home in isolation.
出现明显症状，病情加重，还是要到医院的。
Appear apparent symptom, the condition aggravates, still want to go to the hospital.
