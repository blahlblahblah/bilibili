澎湃新闻记者 贺梨萍 张若婷可查资料显示，“钻石公主”游轮上1723名接受检测的旅游者中，有189名是无症状新冠病毒感染者。
Peng Pai journalist He Liping Zhang Ruoting can check the information, "Princess Diamond" cruise ship 1723 tourists tested, 189 are asymptomatic new crown virus infected.
这显然暗示：在人群中存在着大量的无症状感染者或者症状轻微患者，但他们未被发现。
This clearly implies that there are a large number of asymptomatic infected persons or patients with mild symptoms in the population, but they are not detected.
日前，南京市第二医院（南京中医药大学附属南京医院）、南京医科大学等团队的研究人员在预印本平台medRxiv上在线发表了一项研究成果“南京地区密切接触者中24例无症状新冠病毒感染者的临床特征”。
Researchers from Nanjing Second Hospital (Nanjing Hospital attached to Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine) and Nanjing Medical University published an online study on the preprinted platform medRxiv on the clinical characteristics of 24 asymptomatic new crown virus infections among close contacts in Nanjing.
研究人员表示，识别和隔离无症状感染者和症状轻微者是疫情半阶段防控的关键。
Researchers say identifying and isolating asymptomatic infected people and those with mild symptoms is the key to semi- stage disease prevention and control.
此前很多研究都报道了新冠肺炎患者的临床特征，以及人际传播的证据。
Many previous studies have reported clinical features of patients with Newly Coronary Pneumonia, as well as evidence of interpersonal transmission.
新冠病毒的基因分析显示该病毒和SARS-CoV相似，但不同的是，新冠病毒在患者尚处于潜伏期、并且活动如常的时候就已经是移动的传染源了，这造成了病毒的进一步传播。
Gene analysis of the new crown virus showed it to be similar to SARS-CoV, but unlike the new crown virus, which is a mobile source of infection while the patient is still latent and active, it causes further spread of the virus.
值得注意的是，截至目前，国内无症状感染者的数据有限。
It is worth noting that data on asymptomatic infections in the country are limited to date.
该研究团队对江苏省南京市1月28日至2月9日之间、医院和社区内的所有的新冠病毒密切接触者进行了流行病学调查，对经咽拭子核酸检测呈新冠病毒阳性的24例无症状感染者的临床特征进行了研究，同时描述无症状感染者的病毒传播潜力。
The team conducted an epidemiological survey of all close contacts of the new crown virus in hospitals and communities in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, between January 28 and February 9, and studied the clinical characteristics of 24 asymptomatic infected persons who tested positive for Nucleic Acid (Nucleic Acid) and described the transmission potential of asymptomatic infected persons.
研究团队提到，他们找到的所有无症状病毒携带者都被南京第二医院收治，因此该研究样本在南京具有很强的代表性。
The team noted that all asymptomatic virus carriers they found were admitted to Nanjing No.2 Hospital, so the study sample was highly representative in Nanjing.
他们建议，由于大规模的返工返校正在进行中，积极的接触者追踪措施和严格的健康监控应仍然是中国乃至全球的重要防控战略。
They suggest that aggressive contact tracing and rigorous health surveillance should remain an important strategy for prevention and control in China and around the world, as large-scale rework and back-to-school work is under way.
此外，由于患者核酸检测转阳现象并不少见，研究团队强调应对已出院的新冠患者进行隔离和多次病毒核酸检测。
In addition, since it is not uncommon for patients to detect positive nucleic acids, the team stressed the need for isolation and multiple viral nucleic acid tests for patients discharged from the hospital.
无症状感染者症状较轻，核酸检测对识别年轻群体至关重要24位无症状感染者的基本信息，蓝色框为在湖北的时间，实心棕色三角代表核酸检测阳性，空心棕色三角表示核酸检测阴性论文显示，病例中没有医护人员，其中8例（33.3％）近期有湖北暴露史（病例1和5是湖北居民，病例3、4、6、9、13和17曾去过湖北），他们在湖北的时间段可能是疑似接触时间。
Symptomatic infections are less severe, nucleic acid testing is essential for identifying young people - 24 asymptomatic infections - blue box time in Hubei, solid brown triangulation for nucleic acid positive, hollow brown triangulation for Nucleic acid negative papers, 8 (33.3%) recent Hubei exposure (cases 1, 4, 6, 9, 13 and 17 have been to Hubei).
根据流行病学调查，没有湖北暴露史的其他病例的疑似接触时间标有灰色框。
Other cases with no history of exposure in Hubei province had suspected exposure times marked with grey boxes, according to epidemiological surveys.
每个病例的诊断日期表明，自2020年1月28日以来，去过湖北的病例数有所减少。
The date of diagnosis for each case indicates a decrease in the number of cases visited to Hubei since 28 January 2020.
调查的病例中有各个年龄段的新冠病毒无症状感染者，年龄范围为5至95岁（中位年龄32.5岁），而20.8％（5/24）的病例年龄在15岁以下。
The cases surveyed included asymptomatic new crown virus infections of all ages, ranging in age from 5 to 95 years (median age 32.5 years), while 20.8 per cent (5 / 24) cases were under 15 years of age.
样本中男性病例有8例（33.3％），2例有吸烟史（病例1和病例13），2例被诊断患有糖尿病和高血压（病例8和病例13）。
Eight cases (33.3 per cent) were among men, two had a history of smoking (cases 1 and 13) and two were diagnosed with diabetes and hypertension (cases 8 and 13).
5例（病例2、4、5、6和10）在住院期间出现症状。
In 5 cases (cases 2, 4, 5, 6 and 10) symptoms occurred during hospitalization.
5例病例均发烧，无畏寒，体温在36.5°C-38.0°C之间波动，但没有病例发高烧（体温> 39°C）。
All five cases had a fever, were fearless, and had body temperature fluctuating between 36.5 ° C and 38.0 ° C, but no case had a high fever (body temperature; 39 ° C).
病例4、6和10除发热外没有其他症状。
Cases 4, 6 and 10 showed no symptoms except fever.
病例2还有咳嗽、疲劳和鼻塞症状；病例5还有咳嗽、疲劳、头晕和关节痛症状。
Case 2 also had cough, fatigue and stuffy nose symptoms; case 5 also had cough, fatigue, dizziness and joint pain symptoms.
有几例病例在住院期间也出现了短暂症状，包括畏寒（病例8）、腹泻（病例21和22）和皮疹（病例16和18），但这些症状已由临床专家小组讨论，被认为是静脉内免疫球蛋白的注射反应。
In a few cases, transient symptoms were also observed during hospitalization, including chills (case 8), diarrhoea (cases 21 and 22) and rashes (cases 16 and 18), but these symptoms have been discussed by clinical experts and are believed to be intravenous immunoglobulin injection responses.
这些副作用分别由洛匹那韦/利托那韦和达芦那韦/考比司引起。
These side effects were caused by Lopinavir / Litonavir and Darunavi / Kaubis, respectively.
因此，以上病例未归类为新冠病毒引起症状的病例。
Therefore, the above cases are not classified as cases with symptoms caused by the new crown virus.
入院时，所有24个病例均进行了胸部CT扫描。
At the time of admission, all 24 cases underwent a chest CT scan.
其中12例（50.0％）表现出典型的新冠肺炎胸部CT图像，即显示肺部有毛玻璃或斑块状阴影。
Of these, 12 (50.0%) showed a typical CT image of the chest with Newly Coronary Pneumonia, showing a hairy glass or plaque-like shadow in the lungs.
5例（20.8％）在肺部出现条纹阴影，这是一种非典型的图像。
Five cases (20.8%) showed streak shadows in the lungs, an atypical image.
其余7例（29.2％）的CT扫描结果正常。
The remaining 7 cases (29.2%) had normal CT scan results.
24个病例中有4例（16.7％）入院时出现淋巴细胞减少（小于0.8×109个细胞/L）。
In 4 out of 24 cases (16.7%) lymphocytes were reduced on admission (< 0.8 x 109 cells / L).
在4个病例中也观察到白细胞减少症，病例2和病例5在住院期间发生了白细胞减少。
Leucocytopenia was also observed in four cases, with leukocytopenia in cases 2 and 5 during hospitalization.
丙氨酸转氨酶、天冬氨酸转氨酶、肌酸激酶、C反应蛋白以及D-二聚体水平的升高症状不常见。
Elevated levels of alanine transaminase, aspartic acid transaminase, creatine kinase, C-reactive protein and D-dimer levels are uncommon.
7例患者血清乳糖脱氢酶水平升高，其中3例伴有C反应蛋白水平升高。
Serum levels of lactose dehydrogenase increased in 7 patients, including 3 patients with elevated C-reactive protein levels.
总体来说，与先前在湖北武汉报道的相比，这些无症状病例病情较轻。
Overall, these asymptomatic cases were less severe than those previously reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province.
值得注意的是，研究团队发现，即使在住院期间，年轻的病例（<15岁）也更容易成为无症状患者，并且CT图像正常。
Notably, the team found that even when hospitalized, young patients (& lt; 15) were more likely to be asymptomatic, and that CT images were normal.
这部分表明核酸检测对于识别年轻的密切接触者的无症状感染至关重要。
This suggests, in part, that nucleic acid testing is essential for identifying asymptomatic infections in young, close contacts.
存在复阳现象，有病例传染期已长达29天以上在初期治疗中有21例（87.5％）患者接受了抗病毒治疗，其中1例还接受了抗生素治疗、抗真菌治疗和免疫球蛋白治疗，还有2例患者接受了免疫球蛋白治疗。
There were cases of reconstructive infection lasting more than 29 days. Twenty-one cases (87.5 per cent) of patients received antiviral treatment in the initial treatment, including one case of antibiotic treatment, antifungal therapy and immunoglobulin treatment, and two cases of immunoglobulin therapy.
所有这些病例均使用了干扰素雾化治疗，没有一例发生严重的肺炎，因此也都不需要全身性激素治疗、机械通气或进入ICU，没有一例死亡。
All these cases were treated with interferon nebulization, none of which had severe pneumonia and therefore did not require systemic sex hormone therapy, mechanical ventilation or access to the ICU, and none of them died.
截至2020年2月18日（论文截稿），共有18例（75.0％）患者的病毒被清除（2次核酸检测连续阴性），其中9例已出院，其余9例留在医院以进一步观察。
As at 18 February 2020 (paper cut-off), a total of 18 cases (75.0 per cent) had been cleared of viruses (2 consecutive negative nucleic acid tests), of which 9 had been discharged and the remaining 9 remained in the hospital for further observation.
6个病例（病例3、8、13、16、19和23）的核酸检测结果为阴性后，反转为阳性。
In six cases (cases 3, 8, 13, 16, 19 and 23) negative nucleic acid testing results were reversed to positive.
特别值得关注的是，即使在核酸测试连续两次阴性之后，病例18仍再次显示阳性。
Of particular concern is the fact that even after two consecutive negative nucleic acid tests, case 18 again showed positive results.
5例（病例7、9、11、14和24）在短时间内清除了病毒。
Five cases (7, 9, 11, 14 and 24) were cleared within a short period of time.
作者将传染期定义为：从患者核酸检测阳性的第一天到连续阴性的间隔期。
The authors defined the period of infection as the interval between the first day a patient tested positive for nucleic acid and the continuous negative.
研究得出传染期范围为1到21天（中位数：9.5天，IQR为3.5-13.0天）。
The study found that the period of infection ranged from 1 to 21 days (median: 9.5 days and IQR: 3.5-13.0 days).
但是值得注意的是，由于6名患者没有检查数据，且患者确切的首次感染日期不确定，因此上述传染期可能被低估了，实际传染期要比计算的更长。
It is worth noting, however, that the above-mentioned period of infection may have been underestimated and the actual period of infection was longer than calculated, owing to the unavailability of data from six patients and uncertainty as to the exact date of the patient's first infection.
特别是病例13无症状感染者，直到2020年2月18日仍对新冠病毒呈阳性，这表明传染期可能长达29天（从2020年1月21日至2月18日）。
Case 13, in particular, was asymptomatic and was still positive for the new crown virus until 18 February 2020, suggesting that the transmission period could be as long as 29 days (from 21 January to 18 February 2020).
研究人员发现7例（29.2％）患者的CT图像正常，住院期间没有任何症状。
The researchers found CT images were normal in seven cases (29.2%) and no symptoms during hospitalization.
与其他病例相比，这7例病例更年轻（中位年龄为14.0）。
These 7 cases are younger than the other cases (median age 14.0).
CT显示正常与不正常的两组无症状患者的其他特征没有差异，作者们认为这可能是由于样本量有限所致。
CT findings showed no difference in other characteristics between normal and abnormal asymptomatic patients, which the authors believe may be due to limited sample size.
这7例患者的血液检查均未见明显异常。
Blood tests in all 7 patients showed no significant abnormalities.
这7例患者的中位传染期为4.0天。
The median period of infection was 4.0 days in these 7 patients.
截至2020年2月18日，这24例病例均未出现严重肺炎，仅5例在住院期间表现出典型症状。
As of 18 February 2020, none of the 24 cases had severe pneumonia and only 5 had typical symptoms during hospitalization.
与此前的研究相似，发烧、咳嗽和疲劳是主要症状。
Similar to previous studies, fever, cough and fatigue are the main symptoms.
先前代表着疾病严重程度的淋巴细胞减少和白细胞减少在本研究的无症状病例中并不常见。
Lymphocyte reduction and leucocytopenia, which previously represented the severity of the disease, were not common in the asymptomatic cases studied.
病例13的家庭传播：无症状新冠病毒携带者的传播证据病例13的家庭传播示意图，黄色框代表潜伏期，粉色框表示症状显现期研究团队审查了每个因确诊或疑似新冠病毒感染入院的病例及其家庭成员的病历和流行病学史。
Case 13 Family transmission: Evidence of transmission of asymptomatic new crown virus carriers - Case 13 Family transmission map, yellow box for latency, pink box for symptom onset period The research team reviewed the medical records and epidemiological history of each case admitted and their family members with a confirmed or suspected new crown virus infection.
在病例13的家庭中，家属1（病例13的妻子）首先去了医院。
In the family of case 13, the first family member (the wife of case 13) went to the hospital.
家属1为64岁女性，此前身体健康，但在2020年1月30日开始发烧（最高体温为38.7°C），且有咳嗽、疲劳和呕吐症状。
Family member 1 is a 64-year-old woman who was previously in good health but had a fever (maximum 38.7 ° C) on 30 January 2020 and developed cough, fatigue and vomiting.
3天后（2020年2月2日），她去了医院，并被检测出新冠病毒阳性。
Three days later (2 February 2020), she went to the hospital and was tested positive for the new crown virus.
然后，医院对她的儿子（家属2），儿媳妇（家属3）和病例13进行了流行病学调查和核酸检测。
The hospital then conducted epidemiological investigations and nucleic acid tests on her son (family 2), daughter-in-law (family member 3) and case 13.
家属2和家属3都在检查之前就已经出现了呼吸道症状，最终也确诊为新冠肺炎。
Both family members and dependents3 developed respiratory symptoms prior to the examination and were eventually diagnosed with Newcomial Pneumonia.
病例13的核酸测试结果也呈阳性，但他在入院时没有任何症状。
Case 13 also tested positive for nucleic acid, but he did not show any symptoms at the time of admission.
在流行病学调查中，病例13表示他于2020年1月19日至1月20日曾前往湖北省黄冈市。
In the epidemiological investigation, case 13 indicated that he had travelled to Huanggang City, Hubei Province, from 19 January to 20 January 2020.
家属1、家属2和家属3是南京本地居民，并且表示在最近14天内，除了接触病例13以外，没有与任何确诊或疑似新冠肺炎患者的接触史。
Family members 2 and dependants 3 are local residents of Nanjing and state that in the last 14 days there has been no history of contact with any person diagnosed or suspected of having pneumonia except for case 13.
在3个受感染的家庭成员中，家属1出现了严重的新冠肺炎症状，并于2020年2月6日被送入ICU。
Among the three infected family members, 1 the family member developed severe symptoms of pneumonia and was sent to the ICU on 6 February 2020.
家属2和家属3在2020年2月18日清除了病毒。
Family members 2 and dependants were cleared of the virus on 18 February 2020.
总体来说，无症状的新冠病毒携带者病例13将病毒传染给了他的家庭成员，其中1名感染者发展为严重的新冠肺炎并被送入ICU。
In general, asymptomatic cases of HCV spread the virus to his family members, with one of the infected developing severe pneumonia and being sent to the ICU.
这些发现表明，无症状携带者可导致人际传播，应将其视为新冠病毒感染的来源。
These findings suggest that asymptomatic carriers can cause interpersonal transmission and should be seen as a source of infection with the new crown virus.
因此，研究团队强调，多重核酸筛查、严格监测近距离接触者，进而遏制疫情的潜在暴发具有重要的公共卫生意义。
The research team therefore stressed the public health importance of multiple nucleic acid screening, rigorous monitoring of close contacts, and thus containment of potential outbreaks.
针对自我保护、密切接触者的主动隔离（无论是在家中还是集中式）的指导也都应不断强调。
Guidance on self-protection, active isolation of close contacts, whether at home or centralized, should also be constantly emphasized.
该项研究还建议，应对已出院的新冠患者进行隔离和多次病毒核酸检测。
The study also recommends isolation and multiple viral nucleic acid testing for patients discharged from the hospital.
当然，该项研究还存在样本量小的限制，研究团队认为接下来需要进行大规模的多中心研究以验证研究的发现。
Of course, the study was limited by small sample sizes, and the team concluded that a large-scale multicenter study was needed to validate the findings.
