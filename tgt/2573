CDC表示一天能做的测试只有100个，有些力不从心。
The CDC says it can do only 100 tests a day, and some are overstretched.
文、图 | 李　莹今天（3月2日）是我滞留在美第38天#详见《口述实录 | 我大年夜出发去美国自助游，直到现在还被困在旧金山》#，美国已有100例新冠病毒感染肺炎病例，其中包括6例死亡病例，这里的人们也开始有些紧张了。
Li Ying, who was at home today (March 2) at my thirty-eighth day of service, is still stranded in San Francisco #. There have been 100 cases of new crown-virus infections, including six deaths, in the United States, and people are starting to get a little nervous.
上周我出门了两次，一次去CVS药房买口罩未果，一次在斯坦福购物广场，没有一人戴口罩。
I went out twice last week, once to CVS pharmacies to buy masks, and once at Stanford shopping mall, none of them wore masks.
斯坦福购物广场而新闻里已经热闹起来，一方面美国疾病控制与预防中心（CDC）中心不断提醒人们，疫情在社区传播只是时间问题，美国不可能在全球化影响下还能独善其身；而另一方面，特朗普和他的副总统不断在晚间发布会里说，美国有能力控制和应对疫情。
Shopping malls in Stamford have become boisterous, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reminding people that it is only a matter of time before the epidemic spreads in the community, and that the US cannot remain immune from the effects of globalization; Trump and his vice-president, on the other hand, have repeatedly said in evening briefings that the US is capable of containing and responding to the epidemic.
但华尔街和老百姓不买账，从2月24日-28日那一周，股市一泻千里，道琼斯指数一周跌了12.36%，这是1900年以来周跌幅排名第十的最大跌幅，排名第一的是1914年的第一次世界大战爆发那周。
But Wall Street and people didn't buy, and in the week from Feb. 24 to Feb. 28, the Dow tumbled 12.36% a week, the biggest weekly decline since 1900, followed by the week of World War I in 1914.
这个从不说谎的市场，让人充分感受到对疫情在全球蔓延的无比担忧。
The market, which has never been a liar, is full of concern about the global spread of the epidemic.
上周五，我所在的美国旧金山湾区圣克拉拉县确诊第四例新冠肺炎病例。
Last Friday, my office in San Clara County, San Francisco Bay, United States, diagnosed a fourth case of New Crown Pneumonia.
美国哥伦比亚广播公司报道称，该感染者是一名成年女性，是第三例的亲属。
CBS reported that the infected person is an adult woman, is the third case of relatives.
华人圈瞬间爆了，大家在疯狂地在网上查询着这个人是不是自己社区的，这个人有没有家人在上班或者读书。
The Chinese community exploded in an instant, and people were frantically enquiring on the Internet whether the person belonged to their community and whether the person had family members working or studying.
然后就是抢购潮到来，朋友圈内分享着到哪个超市米、油、方便食品还有货，哪能买到口罩和消毒用品，并附上人们疯狂从货架上搬运物资和大排长龙结账的照片。
Then the rush arrives, and friends share pictures of what supermarket rice, oil, ready-to-eat foods and supplies, masks and disinfectant supplies, along with pictures of people frantically hauling supplies from shelves and paying bills in long lines.
上周六傍晚，朋友突然接到公司（世界五百强之一）的紧急电话通知，问询员工有没有接触过确诊病例，如果有需要帮助他们会立即派专人处理。
On Saturday evening, friends received an emergency call from the company, one of the 500 largest companies in the world, asking if they had any contact with confirmed cases and if they needed help, they would send someone to take care of it immediately.
空气紧张了几分钟后，我们决定周日得去买点战备物资，不能坐以待毙。
After a few minutes of tense air, we decided to go shopping on Sunday and not sit tight.
我们首先来到美国人超市，令人吃惊的是，不管是袋装还是散装的大米、麦片、红豆、黑豆都没了，一个女士扫空了冰柜里六大盒鸡腿肉！问了下店员，他表示不知发生了什么，这些东西都卖空了！我们再转战另一家价格稍高的美国超市，同样的袋装大米、清洁用品都没了，一对华人情侣戴着口罩推着满满一购物车食品，其中有一半是罐头。
We first came to the American Supermarket and, surprisingly, whether bags of rice, cereals, red beans and black beans were gone, a woman emptied six boxes of chicken leg meat from the freezer! Ask the clerk if he didn't know what had happened, they were short!
于是朋友说要转变思路去墨西哥人超市，因为那里华人较少，而墨西哥人平时注重享乐，对新闻时事漠不关心，可能会有收获，于是他带着我们去到了鲜有涉足的墨西哥人社区。
So a friend said he wanted to change his mind and go to the Mexican supermarket, where there are fewer Chinese, and where Mexicans are likely to reap the rewards of being hedonistic and indifferent to the news.
最终证明他的生活经验是对的，我们顺利地买到了居然还在促销的米、方便面以及超便宜的蔬菜水果，但从停车场里此起彼伏的汽车较劲轰鸣声就能感觉到这个社区的人脾气火爆、互不相让。
It turned out that his life experience was right. We managed to get rice, instant noodles and super cheap fruits and vegetables on sale, but the roar of cars from the parking lot made it clear that the neighborhood was hot-tempered and defiant.
直到美西时间3月2日下午2点，加州已经有确诊的新冠病例33例，CNN、YOUTUBE都在热点位置刊发了相关新闻，有去埃及旅游史的，也有多名因早期未做防护措施护理感染者而被传染的医务人员。
There were 33 confirmed new cases in California by 2: 00 pm on March 2, 2008. CNN and YOUTUBE all posted stories in hot spots, including a history of travel to Egypt and a number of medical staff who had been infected by early failure to take protective measures to care for the infected.
而最让美国人气愤的，就从武汉撤侨包机或钻石公主号上下来的人，人们纷纷指责在撤侨包机上，只是用一块白布围起来表示隔离的措施太过轻率。
The people who got angry most were those who got off the Wuhan charter flight or the Princess of Diamonds, and people accused the evacuation charter flights of being too hasty in wrapping up the quarantine with a piece of white cloth.
而后，美国疾病控制与预防中心（CDC）又连续犯错，先是将钻石公主号上的人送到观察点时仅船上下来的人戴了口罩，而CDC的护送的人完全没有任何防护，传闻事后还在小镇上转悠了一圈；后将检测次数不足、从阴转阳的患者释放出观察点。
Then the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) made a series of mistakes, first by sending the people on board the Princess Diamond to the observation point and then wearing masks by only those who had come off, while the CDC escorts were completely unprotected and rumored to have wandered around the town after the incident.
连得克萨斯州州长格雷格·阿伯特（Greg Abbott）都站出来放话，“这是不可原谅的，CDC必须做的是，改进其流程，并且必须绝对确定在释放这些人之前，他们都没有新型冠状病毒，不论是轻度还是重度。
Even the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, stood up and said, "This is inexcusable. What the CDC must do is improve its processes and be absolutely certain that they are free of the new coronavirus, whether mild or severe, until they are released."
”而CDC表示一天能做的测试只有100个，有些力不从心。
The CDC says it can do only 100 tests a day, and some are overstretched.
今天（3月2日）美股道琼斯指数强力反弹，但朋友们说还是赶紧抛，毕竟这场疫情在美国才刚刚开始。
U.S. stocks rallied strongly today (March 2), but friends said it was time to let go of the epidemic, which has only just begun in the U.S.
