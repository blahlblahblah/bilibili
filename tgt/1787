受访者供图文 |新京报记者 张惠兰编辑｜王婧祎校对|卢茜►本文约3280字，阅读全文约需6分钟喷洒消毒水、穿上防护服、戴上口罩和手套，拿起用75%酒精消毒过的剪刀……如果不是这场突如其来的疫情，理发师王璐无法想象，他有朝一日会这样给顾客理发。
interviewee: Zhang Huilan, editor of the new Beijing News, Zhang Hui Lan, editor: About 3280 words in this article. It takes about six minutes to read the full text with disinfectant, protective clothing, masks and gloves, and a 75% alcohol-disinfected pair of scissors.
顾客们也与以往不同，他们往往疲惫不堪，有人往椅子上一靠，没说几句话就闭目养神；对发型也没有过多要求，只求剪短。
Customers, too, tend to get tired, with people leaning on chairs and closing their eyes without saying much; they don't ask for too much haircut, they just cut short.
2月15日以来，在武汉同济医院中法新城院区的门诊大厅，这样的场景每天都在发生。
Since February 15, in Wuhan Tongji Hospital in the French New Town Hospital out-patient hall, such scenes occur every day.
同济医院中法新城院区是武汉市新冠肺炎重症和危重症病人的收治中心之一。
Tongji Hospital is one of the treatment centers for severe and critically ill patients with Xinguan Pneumonia in Wuhan.
全天24小时，本院及全国多支救援队的7700多名医护人员，交班轮换，维系着这架庞大救治机器的运转。
On a 24-hour basis, more than 7,700 medical staff of the hospital and various rescue teams around the country rotate around the clock to maintain the operation of this huge rescue machine.
收治患者的病区是医护人员与病毒战斗的“主战场”。
The area where the patient is admitted is the "main battleground" between medical staff and the virus.
在“战场”上，头发看似不起眼，却可能绊住“战士们”的脚步。
"Battlefield", hair may seem insignificant, but may stumble on the "soldiers" footsteps.
在防护帽里闷久了的头发，被汗水浸湿，贴伏在头皮上，令人不适，长发掉落出来，还可能成为传播病毒的媒介。
The long-sulking hair in the protective cap, soaked in sweat and lodged on the scalp, makes people uncomfortable, long hair falls out, and may also become a vector for spreading the virus.
可由于武汉市内理发店悉数关门歇业，理发成了难题。
But due to the closure of barber shops in Wuhan, hairdressing became a problem.
为了解决数千名医护人员的理发问题，王璐和几位理发师志愿者在这里集结，“Tony理发屋”正在营业。
To solve the haircut problem for thousands of medical workers, Wang Lu and a few barber volunteers gathered here, "Tony Barber House" is open.

受访者供图开在门诊大厅里的理发屋王璐是地道的武汉人，在青山区经营一家理发店。
The interviewee for the barber shop in the lobby Wang Lu is a genuine Wuhan people, operating a barber shop in the Qingshan area.
疫情发生后，理发店暂时歇业。
The barber shop was temporarily shut down after the outbreak.
2月15日，王璐在一个志愿者群里看到同济医院招募理发师的消息，他立刻拨通了电话。
February 15, Wang Lu in a group of volunteers to see the Tongji Hospital recruitment barber, he immediately dialed the phone.
同济医院后勤处员工、负责组织本次活动的蒋思思告诉新京报记者，在同济医院，有来自全国各地医疗队的4000多名“外援”，再加上本院的一线医护人员，总共有7700多名医护人员。
At Tongji Hospital, there were more than 4,000 medical teams from all over the country, plus the hospital's front-line medical staff, totaling more than 7,700 medical personnel, Jiang who was in charge of organizing the event told the Beijing News.
持续奋战一个多月，许多医护人员的头发长了，但因为疫情的缘故，社会上的理发店基本都在歇业，这么多人的理发问题怎么解决呢？2月14日，蒋思思和同事试探性地问了问自己熟悉的理发师，他们都愿意来，但无奈身在老家，短时间内回不来，后勤处便决定向社会公开招募志愿者。
After more than a month of continuous fighting, many medical staff had long hair, but due to the epidemic situation, the hairdresser in our society basically closed down, so how to solve the problem of hairdresser.
传播效果超乎他们的想象。
The effect was beyond their imagination.
短短一天内，报名电话从全国各地打来，远至东北，考虑到交通阻隔和感染风险，对外地的理发师，蒋思思和同事只好婉拒。
Within a day, calls had been received from all over the country, as far north-east as possible, and given the risks of traffic congestion and infection, Jiang and his colleagues in the field had to decline.
他们联络了数位本地理发师志愿者，2月15日，“Tony理发屋”正式开业。
They contacted several local barber volunteers and the Tony Barber House opened its doors on February 15.
由于中法新城院区专门收治重症和危重症患者，为了保障理发师和医护人员的安全，后勤处在理发屋的选址上做了仔细考量。
To ensure the safety of barbers and medical staff, the Logistics Department has carefully considered the location of the barber shop, as the CIFTA specializes in the treatment of patients with severe and critical illnesses.
蒋思思介绍，因为门诊暂停，原门诊大厅所在的A区一楼变为员工通道，不接待任何患者也没有病人通行，且此前已经过全面消毒，“是整个院区最安全的一个地方”。
The first floor of area A, where the outpatient consultation hall was located, was turned into an employee passageway for patients and no patients, and was previously thoroughly disinfected, making it "the safest place in the whole area," Jiang said.
于是，他们在这里开辟出几间办公室作为理发屋，为了避免人员聚集，除了较大的办公室安排了两名理发师，其余都确保一个理发师一间屋子。
So they opened several offices here as barber shops, and to avoid gathering people, two barbers were placed in the larger offices and the rest ensured a barber's room.
特殊时期，理发屋的布置只能从简。
In special times, barber shop can only be arranged from simple.
一面镜子、一把椅子，没有寻常理发店里洗头用的躺椅和水池，只能用喷壶来打湿头发。
A mirror, a chair, no lounge chair and sink for shampoo in the usual barber shop, wet hair with a spray bottle.

受访者供图设备虽然简陋，但理发师的防护装备绝不能少。
The interviewees were provided with rudimentary equipment, but the barber's protective equipment must not be lacking.
后勤处为理发师们准备了防护服、面罩、手套、口罩等全套防护装备。
The Logistics Service provided the barbers with full protective clothing, face masks, gloves, masks and other protective equipment.
王璐告诉新京报记者，需要先往身上喷洒消毒药水消毒，然后才能进门穿戴防护装备。
Wang Lu told the Beijing News that she needed to spray disinfectant before entering the door to wear protective equipment.
理发的过程中，消毒和防护也须一丝不苟。
In the process of hairdressing, sterilization and protection must also be meticulous.
来参加志愿服务的理发师叶丽说，每理完一位医护人员，他们必须更换一次手套，包括梳子、电推、剪刀在内的理发工具也要经75%酒精多次喷洒消毒。
Ye Li, a barber who volunteers, says that for every doctor they finish cutting, they have to change their gloves. Hairdressing tools, including combs, pushers and scissors, are also sprayed with 75% alcohol several times.
每天结束工作后回家，进门前，叶丽也要用消毒液喷洒全身，擦拭鞋底，再洗个澡之后，才会和家人同桌吃饭。
Every day after work came home, Ye Li also used disinfectant spray all over her body, wipe the soles of her shoes, and take a bath before eating at the table with her family.
“尽量剪短”“尽量剪短。
Cut it as short as you can.
”几天来，这是王璐和叶丽听得最多的一句话。
For a few days this was Wang Lu and Ye Li heard the most.
他们服务了许多两个月都没剪头的医护人员，有的人本打算赶在年底理发，结果临时接到通知，没和家人过上春节就赶来武汉支援，有的男医生头发已经遮住了半个耳朵，“和现在网上说的F4造型也差不离了”。
Some had planned to have their hair cut by the end of the year, but were told on short notice that they would have to travel to Wuhan to support Wuhan after the Spring Festival with their families.
王璐亲身体会过头发长时间闷在防护帽里的感受。
Wang Lu knows firsthand what it feels like to be in a protective hat for a long time.
他以前留着一头长发，戴了一个多小时防护帽、给五六个人理完发后，帽子里面已经布满水汽，无比难受。
He used to have long hair, wearing a protective hat for more than an hour, after finishing his hair for five or six people, the hat was steamy and uncomfortable.
后来，他干脆把头发剃成了板寸。
Later, he simply shaved his hair into an inch.
蒋思思介绍，除了容易出汗外，一线医护人员直接与病人接触，长发一旦暴露在空气中，会增加感染的风险，另外，一天工作下来，医护人员都是“恨不得倒头就睡”的状态，清洗长发也会额外增加他们的负担。
In addition to sweating easily, front-line health-care workers are in direct contact with their patients. Exposure to the air increases the risk of infection. Moreover, when exposed to long hair, health workers "like to sleep on their heads" during the day, adding to the burden of washing their hair.
因此，王璐接待的男医护人员几乎是“能剪平头就剪平头”，对于女士们，则要顾及她们的爱美之心，在保留她们原有发型的基础上，剪短、打薄，同时清理干净她们发际线周边的碎发，防止碎发钻出帽沿。
Therefore, Wang Lu received male medical staff is almost "able to cut flat head on the flat head," and for women, to take into account their love of beauty, in addition to retaining their original hairstyle, short, thin, while cleaning their hair around the edge of the hair line, to prevent hair from drilling out of the brim.
志愿者正在帮一位男医护人员剃光头。
Volunteers are shaving the head of a male paramedic.
受访者供图蒋思思告诉新京报记者，对于医护人员应当理什么样的发型，医院没有任何规定，所有医护人员都是自愿前来理发，头发剪成什么样，也完全取决于他们跟理发师的沟通。
Interviewees told the Beijing News that there was no hospital policy on what hairstyles should be cut by medical staff, and that all health-care workers came voluntarily to have their hair cut, depending on how they communicated with the barber.
“很多护士姐姐妹妹说我没有别的要求，剪短后我可以把头发扎个小鬏鬏，好戴帽子、好穿衣服就行了。
"A lot of nurses, sisters and sisters said I have no other requirements, after a short cut I can take a small quilt to wear a hat and clothes.
”叶丽说，同为女性，她特别能理解她们的心情。
"Ye Li said that being a woman meant she could understand their feelings in particular.
2月17日那天，她服务的几位女医护人员恰好都计划今年5月结婚，她们对叶丽说，只要到婚礼时还能做个发型就可以了。
On Feb. 17, when several of the women she worked with were planning to get married in May, they told Ye they could just have a haircut by the time they got married.
2月18日，王璐碰到了一位吉林医疗队的年轻女医生，一坐下，对方就要求把头发剪短。
On February 18, Wang Lu met a young woman doctor from Jilin Medical Team. As soon as she sat down, she asked for her hair to be cut short.
王璐先是剪了个一寸多长的小男孩发型，不料对方不满意，让他继续剪短，“干脆剪成一个当兵的寸头了”。
Wang Lu cut a little boy's hair more than an inch long, but the other side was not satisfied, let him continue to cut short, "simply cut into a soldier's head.
剪毕，女医生和一位女同伴会合，王璐一看，嚯，同伴竟然剪得比女医生还短，也就是“光头长了一两个礼拜”的长度。
After cutting off, the female doctor and a female companion rendezvous, Wang Lu saw Ooh, the companion even cut short than female doctors, that is, "skinhead for a week or two."
王璐说，疫情当前，不少女医护人员可能尝试了“这一辈子都不敢尝试的发型”。
Wang Lu said that the current epidemic, not teenage health care workers may have tried "this life dare not try the hairstyle."
解开围布，看着镜子里的自己，不少人会挑高眉毛，睁大眼睛，惊讶之余，难免有不舍和失落。
Unraveling the cloth and looking at themselves in the mirror, many people raise their eyebrows and open their eyes wide.
不过，女“战友”们也会互相安慰，“我也剪了，你也剪了，大家都一样，都不吃亏了。
"But the women" comrades-in-arms "would console each other by saying," I've cut it too, and you've cut it too
”叶丽正在帮一位女医护人员头发剪短。
Ye is helping a paramedic cut her hair short.
受访者供图“每个武汉人都觉得医护人员是最至高无上的”“Tony理发屋”里没有音响设备，为了调节气氛、帮助医护人员排解疲劳，王璐和叶丽会努力打开话匣子，陪他们聊聊天。
In order to regulate the atmosphere and help relieve the tiredness of the staff, Lu Wang and Ye will try to open the case and have a chat with them.
不少外地医疗队员说，从没想过自己会以这种方式来到武汉，车子穿行市区，街道却空空荡荡。
Many field medical team members said they never expected to come to Wuhan in this way, the car through the city, but the streets are empty.
王璐问他们，等疫情结束后，还打算再来武汉吗？大多数人给出肯定答复，说要重新认识这座城市。
When the outbreak is over, does Lu ask them if she wants to come back to Wuhan again? Most people give a positive answer, saying she wants to get to know the city again.
王璐便马上发挥东道主的精神，热情推介起武大马上要盛开的樱花，和曾经遍布街头巷尾的热干面。
Wang Lu immediately displayed the spirit of her host, enthusiastically promoting the imminent opening of Wu Da cherry blossoms, and the hot and dry noodles that once covered the streets and alleys.
有的医护人员会聊起自己的家人。
Some health care workers talk about their families.
一位医生孩子年幼，他已经二十多天没回过家，每天只能借视频解思念之苦。
A doctor child is young, he has not returned home for more than 20 days, can only use video to relieve the pain of missing.
一位女护士新婚燕尔，但疫情发生后，她抢先报名上了一线。
A female nurse was newly married, but after the outbreak, she was ahead of the game.
也有医护人员坐下后，寥寥数语交代下发型，就倚在靠背上闭目养神。
Also have medics to sit down, make a few words to explain next hairstyle, lean on the back to close one's eyes.
看着他们脸上的疲惫，叶丽不忍打扰，唯有默不做声地理发。
Looking at their faces tired, Ye Li can not bear to disturb, only silent geographical hair.
王璐说，经此一役，自己从未像现在这样对医护职业充满敬佩，“你要问武汉市民的话，可能这个时候每个武汉人都觉得医护人员是最至高无上的”。
Lu said she had never felt more reverent about the medical profession since the battle. "Ask Wuhan residents if you think medical staff are the most important at this time."
他听说，有市民给外地医疗队送去了地道的纯手工热干面，有饭店老板免费给医护人员送饭菜，还有不少市民号召，等疫情结束后，武汉应该对全国来支援的医护人员免费开放旅游景点。
He heard that some local residents have sent authentic hand-made hot-and-dry noodles to foreign medical teams, hotel owners have given free meals to medical workers, and many citizens have called for Wuhan to open tourist spots free of charge to medical personnel coming to support the country after the outbreak.
蒋思思说，这几天，仍然不断有理发师打来电话报名，随着人员的增加，后勤处也将给理发师们排班，以保证他们有充足的休息时间。
Over the last few days, barbers continue to call in to sign up, and as the number of staff increases, the logistics department will schedule barbers to make sure they have plenty of rest.
在同济医院之外，仍有巨大的理发需求尚待满足。
Outside Tongji Hospital, there is still a huge unmet need for haircuts.
据2月20日国务院联防联控机制新闻发布会上的数据，截至2月19日，全国已有278支医疗队、32395名医务人员驰援湖北。
As of February 19, 278 medical teams and 32,395 medical personnel had been assisting Hubei, according to figures from the press conference of the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council on February 20.
王璐说，自己所在的志愿者群里，有的理发师志愿者一天要跑上四五个医疗队，忙碌到深夜。
Some of her volunteers, Wang said, had to run four or five medical teams a day until late into the night.
少有人知的是，由于长时间捂在橡胶手套里，每天用消毒水反复冲洗，理发师们的双手已经发白、起皮；为了避免室内空气流动传播病毒，医院关闭供暖设备，防护服下，他们必须穿上厚厚的衣服，动作只能放缓下来；工作时，他们戴着双层医用外科口罩，话说多了，不免气喘。
To avoid spreading the virus through indoor air flow, hospitals shut down their heating equipment. They had to put on thick clothes and move only slowly; they wore double-decker medical surgical masks at work, gasping for breath.
但王璐和叶丽都心甘情愿。
But Wang Lu and Ye Li are willing.
尽管每天都要绷着一根弦，但叶丽觉得志愿工作让她感到踏实：“感觉自己可以参与一点点，好像心里会好过一点。
Despite the daily tension, Ye feels reassured by volunteering: "Feel like you can participate a little, as if you're feeling a little better.
”王璐也说，等同济医院的义剪工作告一段落，他还要和同伴们继续到其他医疗队去服务。
Wang Lu said he would wait until the end of the charity work at Tongji Hospital and go on to other medical teams with her companions.
他们都希望，和这座城市的人们一起，用自己的方式向医护人员表示谢意。
They all wanted to join the people of the city in expressing their own gratitude to the medical staff.
