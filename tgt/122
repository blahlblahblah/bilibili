作者|梁耀丹1月23日，疑似感染新冠病毒肺炎的鄢小文被带走隔离时，未曾想到这竟是与17岁的脑瘫儿子鄢成的最后一次见面。
Yan Xiao-wen, 17, was not expected to meet Yansheng, a 17-year-old cerebral palsy son, when he was taken into isolation on January 23.
鄢小文放心不下独自在家、生活无法自理的鄢成，于是向外界求助。
Yan Xiaowen worried about being at home alone and unable to fend for herself, so Yan Cheng asked the outside world for help.
接下来一周的时间里，历经曲折，村镇县三级政府部门、各级残联、中国精神残疾人（下称“中精协”）及中国智力残疾人及亲友协会（下称“中智协”）、武汉心智障碍群体公益组织“蜗牛家园”（下称“蜗牛家园”）、医护人员以及鄢小文二姐等均参与到对鄢成的救助中，全程深入参与了此事的尹安表示。
Over the next week, through twists and turns, government departments at the township and county levels, the Federation of Persons with Disabilities at all levels, the China Association of Mentally Handicapped Persons (hereinafter referred to as "the Chinese Association of Mental Handicapped Persons"), Wuhan public welfare organizations for the mentally handicapped (Snail Home), medical staff and Sister Yan Xiaowen participated.
1月29日，鄢成被转移至村里临时的隔离点，所有人都松了一口气。
On January 29, Yan Cheng was transferred to a temporary isolation site in the village, to the relief of all.
然而，就在那天下午，鄢小文接到了村主任传来的噩耗——鄢成去世了。
That very afternoon, however, Yan Xiao-wen received the bad news from the village director, Yan Cheng dead.
“我知道很多方面在努力，努力成最后，还是这样了。
"I know a lot of people are working hard and trying to come to the end, and that's it.
”鄢小文在电话中说。
"Yan Xiaowen said by telephone.
1月30日，红安县华家河镇政府电话多次拨打无人接听。
January 30, Hongan County Huajiahe township government telephone calls repeatedly unanswered.
红安县委宣传部新闻科长毛红平电话中表示，目前已经成立调查小组处理此事，将尽快发表新闻通稿。
Hongping Mao, head of the propaganda department of Hongan county committee, said in a telephone call that an investigation team had been set up to deal with the matter.
截至发稿，相关通稿未见发出。
As of the draft, relevant circulars have not been issued.
被隔离的父亲鄢小文，湖北红安县华家河镇鄢家村人，单身家庭父亲。
Isolated father Yan Xiaowen, a man from Visayas Village, Hongan County, Hubei Province, father of a single family.
17岁的大儿子患有脑瘫，四肢瘫痪、有智力障碍，无语言能力、行走能力及生活自理能力。
The 17-year-old son has cerebral palsy, quadriplegia, mental retardation, speech disability, walking ability and independence.
此外，鄢小文还有个10岁的患有中度自闭症的小儿子。
Yan Xiao Wen also has a 10-year-old son with moderate autism.
根据尹安的说法，鄢小文早年在食堂工作，后来妻子去世后，为了照顾孩子便辞掉了工作，靠低保生活，平时居住在公益组织“蜗牛家园”。
Yan Xiaowen, who worked in the cafeteria earlier this year, quit his job to take care of his children and live on the daisies of a public welfare organization, the Snail Home, according to Yin.
春节前，鄢小文带着两个孩子从武汉汉口区回到老家黄冈市红安县华家河镇鄢家村，并出现了发热症状。
Yan Xiao Wen and her two children return to the Visayas Village in Honghe County, Huanggang City, from Hankou District, Wuhan, before the Spring Festival, and develop fever symptoms.
1月23日，鄢小文被带到红安县华家河镇卫生院隔离观察。
On January 23, Yan Xiaowen was taken to the Huajiahe Town Health Center in Hongan County for observation.
尹安表示，由于鄢成没有自主行动能力，加上没有感染新冠肺炎的症状、卫生院床位紧张等情况，因此被独自留在家中。
Yin said Yan Cheng was left at home alone because of her lack of autonomy, her lack of symptoms of pneumonia and the strain of her hospital bed.
尹安表示，23日上午，鄢小文把儿子被独自留在家中的情况告诉了在武汉的两位家长好友。
Yan told his two parents and friends in Wuhan that their son had been left at home alone on the morning of 23, Yin said.
两位家长随后辗转联系到村委会、当地政府部门、各级残联等组织，引起重视。
The two parents then contact the village committee, local government departments, the Federation of Disabled Persons at all levels and other organizations, attracted attention.
这一天，鄢家村村委会派卫生员前去探视，而根据这一天村委会主任的反馈，鄢成跟鄢小文密切接触，而卫生员没有防护服，存在护理风险。
On that day, the Visayas Village Council sent a health worker to visit him, and on that day, Fansong entered into close contact with Yan Xiaowen, who had no protective clothing and was at risk of nursing, according to the village committee director.
根据鄢小文的说法，23日晚上，其二姐也去给鄢成喂了吃的。
According to Yan Xiaowen, her second sister also went to Yan Cheng to feed her on the evening of 23.
鄢小文表示，1月24日，二姐又去给鄢成喂了一次饭。
Yan Xiao Wen says that on January 24, her second sister went to Yan Cheng for another meal.
这一天，鄢小文和小儿子被转院至红安县定点的隔离医院——杏花乡卫生院。
On that day, Yan Xiaowen and her youngest son were transferred to a designated isolation hospital in Hongan County, the Xianghua Township Health Center.
尹安表示，到了1月25日，即大年初一这一天，鄢小文二姐因为身体出现不舒服，没去看望孩子。
Yin said that on January 25, the first day of New Year, Yan Xiao-wen's second sister did not visit her children because of discomfort.
鄢小文称，正是从这天开始，鄢成属于“无人管理的状态”。
Yan Xiaowen says that it was precisely on this day that Yan Cheng became "unsupervised."
尽管村委会每天都派人过去看鄢成，但由于村委会缺乏防护工具，因此没有人照顾鄢成吃喝拉撒。
Although Yancheng is visited daily by the village council, Yan Cheng is not cared for by her because the village committee lacks protective tools.
尹安回忆，25日这天，身在武汉的家长朋友请求村委会派人去给孩子做护理，没有得到回复。
On May 25, his parents and friends in Wuhan asked the village committee to send someone to take care of their children, Yin recalled.
家长朋友又联系华家河镇卫生院，问孩子是否能送去福利院代管集团，得到的回复是不行，必须就地隔离。
Parents and friends also contact Huajiahe Town Health Center, asked whether the children can be sent to the care group, the response is no, must be isolated in situ.
多方救助的落空围绕着鄢成的多方救助就此拉开帷幕。
The collapse of multiple bailouts by Yan Cheng began with a series of rescues.
根据尹安的说法，1月26日，卫生员又去探望了鄢成，但由于没有防护措施，没有给孩子喂食和做护理。
On January 26, Yanan was visited by a doctor, but Yancheng was unable to feed and care for her children because of lack of protective measures.
当天鄢成出现了发热症状，华家河镇卫生院和村委会相关负责人前去探望鄢成，为其量了体温，并把他送至当地卫生院做检查。
Yancheng Yan Cheng showed signs of fever and was taken to Yan Cheng by relevant officials of the Huajiahe Hospital and Village Committee to visit Yan Cheng, where he was taken to the local clinic for tests.
尹安称，但镇卫生院床位紧张，想将鄢成送至县里的杏花乡卫生院由鄢小文亲自照顾，但由于鄢成大小便无法自理，杏花乡卫生院考虑到其他病人等因素拒绝接收。
Yin said the township hospital bed was tight, but Yan Cheng Yan sent to the county's Xianghua Township Health Center under Yan Xiao-wen's personal care, but Yancheng couldn't take care of himself.
几方努力下，鄢成还是被接回了家中。
Several efforts by Yan Cheng led him home.
26日晚上，工作人员给鄢成喂了一些蛋黄派。
On the night of February 26, Yan Cheng was fed some egg yolks.
尹安介绍，1月27日，眼看着鄢成的日常照料和护理问题仍未解决，另一名家长协调，将情况汇报给中国残联，湖北省及红安县各级残联、中国精协、中国智协等组建了关于救助鄢成的微信群，希望协调各方，给村里安排防护服，降低护理人员的风险。
Yin said that on January 27, while Yan Cheng's routine care and care problems remained unresolved, another parent coordinated the reporting to CDPF, the CDPF at various levels in Hubei Province and Hongan County, the China Association of Excellence and the China Consultation Association, hoping to coordinate efforts to arrange protective clothing for the villages and reduce risks for nursing staff.
与此同时，家长还以鄢小文名义在社交平台发出一封求助信，向社会征集红安县华家河镇周边可供调用的防护工具（防护服、防护眼镜及N95口罩）。
At the same time, parents, in the name of Yan Xiaowen, issued a letter of request for help on a social networking platform to solicit protective tools (protective clothing, glasses and N95 face masks) for use around the town of Hua Jiahe in Hong'an County.
各方努力起得初步成果。
The parties worked hard to achieve initial results.
这一天，华家河镇镇长召集相关政府部门以及村委会，研究部署与鄢成有关的照料工作。
On that day, the Mayor of Huajiahe convened relevant government departments and village committees to study the deployment of care work related to Yan Cheng.
县残联也与各方协调，为看护人员申请到了一套防护服，于次日上午送至村里，并派人来慰问。
In coordination with the parties, the CDPF also requested a suit of protective clothing for the caretakers, which was sent to the village the following morning with a message of sympathy.
但没有人能知道，27日这天，在各方为鄢成奔走之时，是否有人去喂鄢成吃过东西。
But no one knows if anyone has ever eaten by Yancheng on the 27th, when they are running around for Yan Cheng.
但鄢小文表示，每天都有人跟他汇报孩子的情况，每天都说“孩子正常”。
But Yan Xiaowen said he was told daily about his children and that "the children are normal" every day.
鄢小文表示，28日上午，二姐再次来到家中，为鄢成做护理。
Yan Xiao Wen said that on the morning of 28, her second sister came home again to care for Yan Cheng.
这个时候，她发现孩子浑身都湿透了，对其喂水喂食，但已经吃不进去东西了。
By this time, she found the child wet through and fed him water, but she could not eat anything.
据悉，除了二姐，穿戴了防护服的村医也随行来到家中。
It is reported that in addition to the elder sister, wearing protective clothing village doctor also came home.
尹安回忆，28日下午，武汉的家长们与村委会主任、红安人民医院、当地公安等联系，称孩子情况紧张需要住院，但得到医院的回复是孩子需要监护人陪同，否则无法派出120出诊。
On the afternoon of May 28, the parents of Wuhan contacted the director of the village committee, Hongan People's Hospital and local public security, saying the children were in a critical condition and needed hospitalization.
村委会主任当天下午与护理人员来看望鄢成，喂了一点氨基酸。
The village committee director and nursing staff came to Yancheng that afternoon to feed a little amino acid.
这天晚上，各方协调之下，鄢成计划于29日被转移至当地的疑似感染新冠肺炎的隔离安置点，由华家河镇医院负责安排照护。
That evening, Yan Cheng was scheduled to be transferred to a local quarantined site suspected of contracting New Crown Pneumonia, with care arranged by the Huagahe Hospital.
29日中午，鄢成被转移去乡里临时建的隔离点。
At noon on the 29th, Yan Cheng was transferred to a temporary quarantine facility in the countryside.
鄢小文回忆，直到这个时候，村委会还跟他汇报称，“孩子情况很好”。
Yan Xiaowen recalled that until that time, the village council had reported to him that "the children were doing well."
到了下午，他接到了鄢成去世的噩耗。
In the afternoon, he received the news of Yan Cheng's death.
“他（鄢成）是一个非常顽强的孩子，并不是说一餐两餐不吃就能饿死的。
"He is a very hardy boy, by Yan Cheng, and doesn't mean you can starve to death without two meals.
”鄢小文表示。
"Yan Xiao Wen says.
尹安跟鄢小文都在蜗牛家园。
Yin and Yan Xiaowen are both at the snail's home.
她回忆，鄢小文对两个孩子的照顾可谓无微不至，两个孩子每天都收拾得干干净净。
Yan Xiao Wen, she recalls, took good care of her two children, who were kept clean every day.
即便是大小便无法自理的鄢成，每天也被父亲悉心照理得身上没有一丝异味。
Even Yan Cheng, unable to take care of herself, was taken care of by her father by her father every day.
尹安称，残障孩子的看护和料理非常耗费家长的精力，而对于单亲的家庭而言，看护残障孩子更为困难。
Yin said caring for and caring for disabled children was a drain on parents' energy, while caring for disabled children was more difficult for single-parent families.
另一位参与此事的人员表示，其感到非常自责，这几天各方一直跟进此事，以为孩子会得到救助，却没想到等来这样的结局。
Another person involved in the matter said he felt very remorseful and that the parties had been following up on the matter for days in the hope that the child would be rescued, but had not expected such an outcome.
鄢小文表示，目前他仍在隔离状态，希望委托人安排鄢成后事。
Yan Xiaowen says he is still in quarantine and hopes his client arranges for Yan Cheng to follow suit.
他希望将鄢成的全部遗体和器官进行捐赠，若无法进行遗体捐赠，需等调查组调查结果出来后，再视情况处理。
He hopes to donate all the bodies and organs by Yan Cheng, or if they cannot be donated, wait for the results of the investigation team to be determined as appropriate.
