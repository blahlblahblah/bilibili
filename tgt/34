/《想见你》在这场疫情防控阻击战中，每个个体在关心当下时事时，也要学会体察自己的情绪与心理。
To See You In this battle of containment and prevention, each individual needs to learn to be aware of his or her emotions and emotions as he or she cares about current events.

Unsatisfied appetite, restlessness, still holding the cell phone in the early hours of the morning to exhaust all the information related to the new coronavirus pneumonia, afraid to miss the transmission of every friend or true or false video.
当各种信息接踵而至，有人心神不宁，有人情绪黯然。
When all sorts of information follow, some people are uneasy, some are depressed.

大量的负面消息，只会加重焦虑、不安、无助感与孤独感”，在武汉蓝天卢林心理工作室主任医师卢林看来，在这场疫情防控阻击战中，每个个体在关心当下时事时，也要学会体察自己的情绪与心理。
A lot of negative news can only increase anxiety, uneasiness, helplessness and loneliness, "said Lu Lin, director of Wuhan Blue Sky Lulin Psychological Studio. In the battle to prevent and control the disease, each individual should also learn to be aware of his emotions and psychology while caring about current events.
可以说，汹涌的疫情牵动着每个中国人的神经。
It can be said that the surge of the epidemic affected the nerves of every Chinese.
1月29日晚19:35数据。
19: 35 data for 29 January evening.
1月27日，中国社会科学院社会学研究所发布的《新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情下的社会心态》报告显示：从民众的情绪反应来看，在积极情绪方面，民众面对新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情不强烈的乐观、平静体验居多，分别为42.8%和53.9%。
On January 27, the Institute of Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences published a report entitled "Social Psychology under the New Coronavirus Pneumonia" which showed that the people's emotional response showed that the optimistic and calm experience of the new coronavirus pneumonia was low, with 42.8 percent and 53.9 percent respectively.
在消极情绪方面，首先是有较强烈的担忧，占比79.3%，其次有较强烈的恐惧，占比40.1%，再次是有较强烈的愤怒，占比39.6%，表明担忧是民众目前面对新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情较占主流的情绪。
In terms of negative emotions, the first was the strong concern (79.3%), followed by the stronger fear (40.1%), followed by the stronger anger (39.6%), indicating the concern that the population is now facing a more dominant mood towards the new coronavirus pneumonia.
人在焦虑和抑郁的情况下免疫力会下降其实，从心理学角度而言，人类遇到危险出现紧张恐惧，遇到困难压力出现焦虑，遇到伤害出现抑郁无助，某种程度都是正常的、下意识的生理和情绪反应。
In fact, from a psychological point of view, people are exposed to danger, nervous fear, stress, anxiety, depression and helplessness, all of which are normal, subconscious physiological and emotional reactions.
经历过“非典”、汶川地震等危机干预救援的北京大学副教授、临床心理学博士徐凯文，在《被传染的不仅是病毒，还有恐慌》一文中就提到，面对灾难和危险，人们出现恐慌是一种必然，是正常人类应对不正常情况的正常反应。
Xu Kevin, an associate professor at Peking University and an associate professor of clinical psychology who has experienced crisis intervention such as the SARS and Wenchuan Earthquakes, wrote in The Infected Not only Virus, but also Panic that in the face of disaster and danger, panic is inevitable and normal human response to abnormal situations.
“这些反应在一定的程度范围内，不仅是正常的，甚至还有增加生存机会的作用。
"To a certain extent, these reactions are not only normal, they even increase the chances of survival.
例如这次疫情中购买和使用口罩，避免不必要的外出，不去高危的场所，积极获取相关医疗信息等。
For example, in this outbreak, buy and use masks, avoid unnecessary travel, do not go to high-risk places, actively obtain relevant medical information, etc.
”面对灾难，恐慌是一种正常反应。
Panic is a normal response to disaster.
在卢林看来，“首先我们要正视自己的这种生理和情绪反应”，而且她相信大部分人群，会逐渐建立起一些心理防御机制对抗焦虑，“但不排除有人会出现急性应激障碍”。
In Lulin's view, "first we have to face up to our physiological and emotional reactions," and she believes that most people develop psychological defense mechanisms to fight anxiety, "but we don't rule out an acute stress disorder."
自武汉“封城”后，卢林便组织志愿者团队为疫区提供心理援助，他们接到的电话中，就出现了一些出现急性应激障碍的人，比如有人说自己会过度洗手洗到破皮，有人则彻夜难眠……“甚至还有武汉之外的人打来电话，说自己出冷汗、肚子疼、头痛、头昏、手脚麻木”，卢林认为，在排除躯体病症后，这一系列反应很可能是一种身心障碍。
Since Wuhan "closed the city," Lulin has organized a team of volunteers to provide psychological assistance to the affected areas. They have received calls from people who say they wash their hands too much until their skins are torn and others who stay up all night... "Even people outside Wuhan call saying they are sweating, stomachache, headache, dizziness, numbness in their hands and feet.
“少看朋友圈，少看转发的内容。
"Look less at your circle of friends and less at forwarding content.
每天给自己规定上下午两个时间段看手机，每次只看半小时。
Set yourself two time slots each day to watch the phone for half an hour at a time.
” 而对于某些非常焦虑、恐慌甚至激动的人，她建议要适时拨打心理热线寻求帮助。
"For some people who are very anxious, scared or even excited, she suggests calling a psychological hotline at the appropriate time.
不止一位心理学者提到，在突发性公共事件中，许多损失可能不是事件本身造成，而是由于人们的过度恐慌导致。
More than one psychologist has suggested that in sudden public events, much of the damage may not have been caused by the event itself, but by people's excessive panic.
戴着口罩的路人。
A passer-by wearing a mask.
/图虫创意正如徐凯文在“被传染的不仅是病毒”一文中强调的，过度的恐慌会导致一系列身心乃至社会后果，造成次生灾害，“这种社会层面的心理次生灾害所造成的负面影响可能比灾害本身更严重。
As Xu Kevin emphasized in his book Infected Not Only Viruses, excessive panic can lead to a series of physical, psychological and even social consequences that can lead to secondary disasters. "The negative impact of this social aspect of a secondary disaster can be more severe than the disaster itself."
”因为，首先对个体而言，焦虑会削弱人的免疫系统。
For, above all, for individuals, anxiety weakens the immune system.
曾担任儿科副主任医师、神经科主任医师的卢林说：“人在焦虑和抑郁的情况下免疫力会下降，因为你体内的激素会有所改变，你的免疫活性物质也会有改变。
Lulin, a former deputy pediatrician and chief physician in neurology, said: "Your immune system decreases with anxiety and depression because your hormones change and your immune activity changes.
”卢林觉得，做好保护与防护措施，本身也是避免焦虑和抑郁的重要方式。
Mr Lulin feels that being well protected and protected is itself an important way to avoid anxiety and depression.
“因为人在不知如何保护自己，不知该做什么时，最慌张最愤怒最无助。
"Because people do not know how to protect themselves, do not know what to do, the most panic and anger the most helpless.
知道怎样保护自己了，某种程度也会放下心来。
You know how to protect yourself, and to some extent you can relax.
”当感觉过于兴奋、过于愤怒，一定要切断和负面信息的联系对群体而言，当灾难和危险发生时，往往也是谣言四起之时。
When you are feeling too excited or too angry, be sure to sever the connection with negative messages. For groups, when disaster and danger occur, it is often the time when rumours are rife.
如今社交网络能够穷尽一切的事件细节和多方声音，数不清的视频、图像则让灾难和苦痛赤裸裸地展现在大众眼前。
Today, social networks are able to exhaust the details of events and multiple voices, and countless videos and images reveal disaster and suffering starkly.
“人在与世隔绝的时候，获得的信息是不完整的。
"When people are isolated, the information they receive is incomplete.
我注意到我每天沉溺于手机，刷屏关于‘武汉肺炎’的消息，一方面是想借助他人的不完整，拼凑出想要的信息完整，好让自己有点掌控感，一方面是身体仍然处在恐慌当中的逃避行为。
I noticed that I indulged in my cell phone every day, brushing the news of Wuhan Pneumonia. On the one hand, I wanted to use the incompleteness of others, to put together the information I wanted, to give myself a sense of control, and on the other hand, my body was still in a panic.
”武汉心理咨询师黄红玲在一篇自述文章中，如此描述在“封城”的日子里如何面对自己的恐慌。
In a self-report, Wuhan psychologist Huang Hongling described how she faced her panic during the days of "closure."
过度恐慌时，人们更容易被谣言影响。
When there is too much panic, people are more likely to be influenced by rumors.
黄红玲提到的那种人人渴望的“掌控感”，恰恰与谣言产生有某种联系。
The "sense of control" that Huang Hongling mentioned, to which everyone aspires, had something to do with rumors.
就像徐凯文也提到，“当人们处在紧张、焦虑、失控和恐惧中时，总是期望尽快控制局面，解除焦虑，因此会格外关注危险的信息。
As Xu Kevin put it, "When people are nervous, anxious, out of control, and fearful, they expect to control the situation and relieve their anxiety as soon as possible.
这种本能的关注会使人增加对危险的易感性，处在高度紧张、警觉的状态中。
This instinctive concern increases susceptibility to danger and is in a state of heightened tension and alertness.
在信息爆炸的时代，这又会使人们接收并相信大量的负面信息。
In the age of information explosion, this makes people accept and believe a lot of negative information.
恐慌情绪的相互传递、传染又在不断‘印证’谣言的可信性。
The mutual transmission of panic, infection in the 'proof' of rumor credibility.
”因而，当网络能穷尽各种声音导致谣言盛行时，我们如何分辨真伪？关注权威科学信息，关注官方媒体，是众多心理学人士给出的答案。
So how can we tell truth from falsehood when the Internet exhausts all kinds of voices? Attention to authoritative scientific information and attention to the official media is the answer given by many psychologists.
“有些自媒体，是靠贩卖焦虑，增加点击率和关注度。
"Some from the media are selling anxiety, increasing traffic and attention.
如果我们接收到这样一些信息，一定要和官方说法、正规媒体报道进行比对，要找正确渠道进行澄清”，在卢林看来，澄清很重要，这样才能让人保持思考与辨别能力。
If we receive such information, we must compare it with official and official media reports and find the right channel for clarification. In Lulin's view, clarification is important in order to maintain the ability to think and distinguish.
“因为人本身的猎奇性，特别糟糕的消息很容易让人兴奋，所以一定要帮自己设定界限，当感觉过于兴奋、过于愤怒，一定要切断和负面信息的联系，恢复自体稳定的思考能力。
"It's easy to get excited about particularly bad news because of the novelty of the person, so be sure to set boundaries for yourself. When you're too excited or too angry, be sure to disconnect from negative messages and restore the ability to think for yourself.
”保护好自己，关注权威信息。
"Protect yourself and focus on authoritative information.
/图虫创意至于如何进行信息的比对与澄清，卢林认为，可以找平时信任的朋友沟通，也可以打正规热线交流。
As for how to compare and clarify information, Lulin believes that you can talk to friends you trust in normal times, or you can make regular hotline exchanges.
“这样你就可以找到一个参照物，当这个参照物是稳定的，你可能就觉得自己不那么慌了。
"Then you can find a reference, and when the reference is stable, you may feel less flustered.
就像我们开车，在上坡或下坡遇到红灯，我们明明已经踩了刹车，怎么感觉前面的车在向自己靠拢？就那一刻你会心慌，会怀疑是不是自己没有刹住。
Just as we drove up or down a red light, we had braked, how could we feel the car in front of us drawing closer to youAt that moment you would have been in a panic, wondering if we had stopped.
这时，你看一下旁边的参照物，比如稳定的电线杆，当发现自己跟它没有位移，你就会感觉稳定，你会知道是前车在动，之后你可以鸣笛示意对方。
At this point, you look at a nearby reference object, such as a stable telegraph pole. When you find yourself without moving with it, you will feel stable.
”卢林说，寻找参照物其实是普通人生活中都会用到的稳定化技术，“当参照物稳定，它提供给你的资讯就是稳定的。
Looking for a reference is actually a stabilising technique that ordinary people use in their lives, says Lulin. "When the reference is stable, the information it provides is stable.
”无节制的同情，只会让对方感觉自己更渺小更脆弱其实当信息过载，面对各种真假传言，人们除了无助，也会产生心理学中所谓的“无节制的同情”。
"Unrestrained compassion makes the other person feel smaller and more vulnerable." When information overload confronts false and true rumours, people can develop what they call "unbridled sympathy" in psychology, in addition to helplessness.
因为“当自己处在安全环境，对于不安全的人我们会有愧疚感，甚至罪恶感。
Because when we're in a safe environment, we feel guilty, even guilty, about people who aren't safe.
人在不知道自己可以做什么的时候，是很难过的”。
People are sad when they don't know what they can do.
但卢林表示，这时我们每个人都要忍住所谓“拯救别人”的冲动，因为那只是你内心认为自己无所不能的自恋成分的表现，“那是害人的。
But Lulin says that each of us has to resist the urge to "save others," because it's just a manifestation of the narcissistic component that you think you can do anything about.
无节制的同情只会让对方感觉自己更渺小、更脆弱。
Unbridled compassion only makes the other person feel smaller and more vulnerable.
要鼓励对方的心理建构重新稳定，才是最重要的。
The most important thing is to encourage the other party to restore their psychological stability.
”对于普通人而言，目前更多的是要按照已经广为传播的公共卫生安全常识做好自己的本分，减少外出和社交，保护好自己和家人，另外在避免过度关注信息的同时，努力寻找一些有意义的事情。
"For ordinary people, it's more about doing their part according to the well-publicized public health message, less going out and socializing, protecting themselves and their families, and trying to find something meaningful while avoiding excessive attention to information.
“你可以利用被隔离的大块时间，做平时没时间做的事，比如学一门课程”，卢林有个朋友，在武汉“封城”后从网上买了8.9元的编程课，调侃自己要在7天内搞定编程，而卢林在组织心理救助的同时，准备翻译一本学术专著。
"You can take advantage of secluded chunks of time to do things you don't usually have time to do, such as taking a course." Lulin, a friend of Lulin, bought an 8.9-yuan programming course online after Wuhan "closed the city," mocking himself as he planned to complete the program in seven days, while Lulin prepared to translate an academic monograph while organizing psychological assistance.
“当你要做的事情，恰好具有成长性，也会让你在此时获得一种成就感”，卢林说，这不仅会稀释焦虑，而且会增加人的信心。
"When you do something that happens to grow, it also gives you a sense of accomplishment," says Lulin, who not only dilutes anxiety, but also increases confidence.
正因为人类文明史就是一部与病毒抗争的历史。
Precisely because the history of human civilization is a history of fighting the virus.
因而大疫当前，每个人内心温和坚定的信念与力量，才显得更为可贵。
Therefore, the current pandemic, each person's heart moderate and firm faith and strength, is even more valuable.
目前，青岛市已启动疫情心理危机干预。
At present, Qingdao has initiated the outbreak of psychological crisis intervention.
预防疫情感染，如何进行心理调节？第一，照顾好自己1. 尽可能维持正常的生活作息，要有适当的休息，尽量保持生活的稳定性。
First, take good care of yourself. Maintain a normal life as much as possible, have a proper rest, and try to maintain the stability of your life.
记住，危机事件的发生会令人手忙脚乱，自乱阵脚，因此让生活作息维持规律，是处理危机的必要条件。
Keep in mind that crisis events can be disruptive and disruptive, so maintaining a regular routine is a necessary condition for dealing with a crisis.
2. 给自己列一个令自己感到愉悦的to-do清单，并执行它。
Make a to-do list to feel good about yourself and do it.
平日你一定知道做什么事情会令自己开心。
On weekdays you must know what to do to make yourself happy.
列出来，执行它。
Make a list. Execute it.
例如，允许自己哭一哭，写出你的想法或感受，玩一些不费脑子的小游戏，运动，深呼吸，抱抱可以慰藉你的物体，泡泡热水澡或冲澡，找出令你愉悦的事，与人聊天等等。
For example, allow yourself to cry, write down your thoughts or feelings, play mindless games, exercise, take deep breaths, hug objects that comfort you, soak in hot showers or showers, find pleasurable things, talk to people, etc.
当负面情绪要淹没你时，这些是你应该做的事。
When negative emotions overwhelm you, these are the things you should do.
武汉90后拍摄短视频称：“遵守公共秩序，做好自身防护，就是我们对这件事最大的贡献。
Wuhan 90 after the shooting of short video said: "To abide by public order, do their own defense, is our greatest contribution to this matter.
”第二，处理负向情绪1. 减少因信息过载带来的心理负担在危机时，尽量控制自己每天接收有关信息的时间不超过一个小时，在睡前不宜过分关注相关信息，不道听途说，关注必要的信息，减少杂音。
Second, deal with negative emotions 1. Reduce the psychological burden of information overload In a crisis, try to limit your daily intake of relevant information to no more than one hour. You should not pay too much attention to relevant information before bedtime, pay attention to the necessary information and reduce the noise.
2. 与自我对话，自我鼓励身为人类，我们都有一种自言自语的特殊能力，不论是大声地或无声地自言自语，你都能利用这种能力训练自己克服艰难的挑战。
Self-talk and Self-Encouragement As human beings, we all have a special ability to talk to ourselves, whether aloud or noiselessly, that you can use to train yourself to overcome difficult challenges.
因此你可以这么告诉自己:“它可能不好玩，但我可以应付它”“这会是一段很重要的经历”“我不能让焦虑和生气占上风”。
So you can say to yourself, "It may not be fun, but I can handle it." "It can be an important experience.
3. 运动运动的好处在于帮你减少精神上的紧张， 增加心血管机能，增加自我效能，提高自信心，降低沮丧等。
The benefits of exercise are reduced mental stress, increased cardiovascular function, increased self-efficacy, increased self-confidence and reduced depression.
哪怕你被隔离，也可在隔离地方做做运动，可以很好地调整心态。
Even if you are quarantined, you can do some exercise in a secluded place and adjust your mind well.
刷刷剧、跳跳舞，都有助于调整心态。
Brush drama, dance, all help to adjust the mentality.
/《想见你》4. 正向思维面对 “新型冠状病毒肺炎” 时，可以运用如下的思考方式：l 不要只往坏处看，很多文章也许只是在贩卖焦虑。
This coronavirus pneumonia (coronavirus pneumonia) is a coronavirus pneumonia (coronavirus pneumonia). Do not look on the wrong side of the coin, as many articles may be selling anxiety.
注意每日的资讯中，其实正面信息是多于负面的。
Note that the positive information in the daily news is actually more positive than negative.
留意事实和数据，根据事实，判定自己的担忧是否合理（例如：发病率、死亡率、治愈率、医疗方法的发展、新的药物等）。
Observe facts and figures and determine whether your concerns are justified (e.g. morbidity, mortality, cure rates, development of medical methods, new drugs, etc.).
l 多回忆在每一次遇到危机时你曾如何面对。
Remember how you faced each crisis.
重新肯定自己身为一个个体的能力。
To reaffirm one's ability to be an individual.
l 以合理的态度看待事情，尝试以更广阔的角度了解问题的影响，问题会带来短暂的影响，但长远而言事情最终能改善及成为过去。
Try to understand the impact of problems from a broader perspective. Problems have a short-term impact, but in the long run things eventually improve and become a thing of the past.
保持对前景的盼望，即使在危急时期，也不要忽略在我们身边的美好事物。
Keep faith in the future and don't lose sight of the good things that are around us even in times of crisis.
同理，当你很担心自己和家人将会受到感染，感到很大的心理压力，也建议你继续正向思维：l 不能肯定将来会怎样，但这一刻我仍然拥有健康，我可以继续努力生活。
By the same token, when you are worried that you and your family will get infected and feel psychological pressure, you are advised to continue thinking positively: I am not sure what will happen in the future, but at this point I am still healthy and I can continue to work hard.
l 我也可以提醒我的亲人，保持个人和家庭卫生，戴口罩，以及认真洗手和消毒。
l I can also remind my loved ones to keep personal and family clean, wear masks, and wash hands carefully and disinfect them.
l 我可以加倍留意自己和家人的身心健康，让自己有开心的时间。
l I can double-check my health and that of my family and have fun time.
l 即使我真的生病，也会有很多人陪伴我一起面对。
Even if I am really sick, there will be a lot of people to accompany me to face.
