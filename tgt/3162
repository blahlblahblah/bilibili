门外，44 位新冠肺炎确诊患者正焦急地等着入住；门内，接管光谷院区 E1 区 6 层的医疗队员，正在争分夺秒地做收治病患前最后的准备工作。
Outside the door, 44 patients diagnosed with pneumonia are waiting anxiously to be admitted; inside, they are scrambling to make the final preparations for admission to the sixth floor of Zone E1 in the Kwanggu compound.
病房门打开，病患们迫不及待进入，医疗队迎来首批患者。
The doors opened, patients rushed in, and the medical team welcomed its first patients.
此时距离他们落地武汉，仅仅过去 30 个小时。
It was only 30 hours before they landed in Wuhan.
接管武汉同济光谷院区 E1 区 6 层的医疗队，由南京鼓楼医院以及六合、高淳分院的医护人员一起组成。
Take over Wuhan Tongji Guang Gu courtyard district E1 6-storey medical team, by Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital and Liuhe, Gao Chun hospital medical staff together.
在安装完心电监控、呼吸机等一系列准备工作就绪后，医护人员比出 ok 手势，准备开始收治病人。
After a series of preparations were made for ECG monitoring and ventilator installation, medical staff gestured to begin treating patients.
光谷院区有 17 个病区，分别由来自上海、山东、浙江、江苏、广东、福建六个省市的 17 支医疗队管理，共计 850 个床位，全部收治重症和危重症病人。
The Guangvaliyuan District has 17 disease-ridden areas managed by 17 medical teams from six provinces, including Shanghai, Shandong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Guangdong and Fujian, with a total of 850 beds.
每个病区有 50 张病床，配备 130 个医护人员，其中医生 30 人、护士 100 人。
Each ward has 50 beds and 130 medical staff, including 30 doctors and 100 nurses.
病房门打开的瞬间，患者们迫不及待地进入。
When the door of the ward opened, the patients couldn't wait to enter.
为保证患者安全有序的收治，医护人员一一询问患者身体情况，并安排床位，同时还要不断安抚患者的情绪，维持现场秩序。
To ensure the safe and orderly admission of patients, medical personnel questioned the patient's physical condition, and arrange beds, but also to constantly calm the mood of the patients, maintain order at the scene.
当晚，在经历一番鏖战后，44 名新冠肺炎确诊患者在 3 小时内全部顺利收治入院。
That night, after a long war, all 44 patients diagnosed with pneumonia were admitted to hospital within three hours.
医护人员来到病房，观察并记录患者的病情。
Medical staff came to the ward to observe and record the patient's condition.
将患者安排妥当，医护人员开始思考和商讨治疗方案。
The patient is placed in place and the medical staff begins to think and discuss the treatment options.
2 月 22 日凌晨，病区临时转进了一位危重症患者，医护人员每天 6 班轮换、24 小时不间断守在这位病人身边。
In the early morning hours of 22 February, a critically ill patient was temporarily transferred to the sick area, where medical staff rotated around the clock on six shifts per day.
第二天早班的护士在一只医用手套上写下「加油」两字，垫在病人的气管插管下面，防止管道弯曲、下垂产生堵塞。
The nurse on the morning shift next day wrote "refuel" on a medical glove, cushioned under the patient's trachea cannula, to prevent the pipe from bending and sagging.
每天上午 10 点，专家组讨论诊疗方案。
At 10 a.m. each day, the group discusses the programme.
截至 2 月 24 日，院区收治病人共计 59 人，出院 10 人。
As at 24 February, 59 patients had been admitted to the complex and 10 had been discharged.
医护人员除了要实时关注重症患者的身体情况，他们还要格外关注患者因病情变化而产生的心理波动。
In addition to real-time attention to the health of patients with serious illness, they should also pay special attention to patients due to changes in psychological fluctuations.
焦虑、不安、惶恐、烦躁、低落……这些是重症患者常见的情绪。
Anxiety, restlessness, trepidation, irritability, depression... these are common emotions in patients with severe illness.
每一种情绪背后，对应的都是一段辛酸难言的故事。
Behind each emotion is a tale of bitterness and unutterable.
新冠疫情统计数字实时更新，抽象数字背后是无数鲜活生命的个体叙事。
The new crown epidemic statistics are updated in real time, and behind the abstract numbers are countless individual narratives of living life.
王奶奶 70 多岁，病情不是很重，但非常焦虑，有天甚至跑出病房，对医生大喊「我不治了，我要回家」。
Grandma Wang, in her 70s, was not very serious, but she was very anxious. One day, she even ran out of the ward and shouted to the doctor, "I'm dead. I'm going home."
一名医疗队联络员也是心理科专家，在负责医务管理和联络的同时，发挥所长，为患者提供专业的心理辅导。
A Medical Team Liaison Officer, who is also an expert in the Psychology Section, is responsible for the management and liaison of medical services, developing his / her talents and providing professional psychological support to patients.
在对王奶奶交谈的过程中，了解到因为匆忙入院，没带手机的她始终没能和家人取得联系。
During the conversation with Grandma Wang, she learned that she had never been able to contact her family because of the rush to the hospital.
联络员取来纸笔，写下老人儿子的电话号码。
The liaison took the pen and paper and wrote down the telephone number of the old man's son.
后来护士拨通了电话，儿子让王奶奶安心休养。
Later the nurse dialed and the son reassured Grandma Wang to recuperate.
护士说，老人应该是担心儿子，所以在听到儿子的消息，确认儿子没事后，她也就心安了。
The nurse said the old man should be worried about her son, so she was relieved to hear from him and make sure he was all right.
2 月 26 日，王奶奶已经顺利康复出院。
On February 26, Grandma Wang has successfully recovered from hospital.
一对同时染病的老夫妇同时入院，但因每个病房仅有三个床位，二位老人未能分到同一间，而是分在了相邻的病房。
An elderly couple who had both been hospitalized at the same time were unable to share the same room, as each ward had only three beds, but were in the adjacent ward.
奶奶病情较轻，爷爷的情况却比较严重。
Grandma's condition is light, but grandpa's condition is more serious.
为了不让奶奶担心，爷爷始终不愿接奶奶的电话。
In order not to worry about Grandma, Grandpa always refused to accept Grandma's phone calls.
了解到情况的医护人员主动当起了二位老人沟通的中转站，每天先去看爷爷，告诉爷爷「奶奶特别关心你，等着和你一起出院呢」，再去把爷爷的一些情况适当地转达给奶奶。
The doctors and nurses who knew the situation took the initiative to act as a transit point for communication between the two old people. Every day, they went to see Grandpa and told him that Grandma was very concerned about you and was waiting to leave the hospital with you.
一天深夜，爷爷的病情有变化，奶奶竟然敏锐地感觉到了。
Late one night, Grandpa's illness changed and Grandma was keenly aware of it.
一位护士提起这对老夫妇时说「在这样的时候，『爱』这个字被放大了」。
A nurse said of the old couple, "At times like this, the word 'love' is magnified.
目前爷爷已经度过了最危险的时期，病情趋于稳定。
Now Grandpa has passed the most dangerous period and his condition tends to be stable.
一位近 80 来岁的老年患者跑出病房，医护人员上前安抚，将其劝回房间。
An elderly patient, nearly 80 years old, ran out of the ward and was reassured by paramedics who persuaded him to return to his room.
医护人员不太能听懂他的话，最初以为他只是想回家，后来经过观察，判断老人可能患有阿尔茨海默病和酒精中毒性脑病，意识有障碍，医生对其进行了合适的药物治疗，护士也尽其所能的给予照护。
The paramedics did not quite understand him and initially thought that he only wanted to go home. After observing him, he was judged to be suffering from Alzheimer's disease and alcoholic encephalopathy, that he was mentally disturbed, that he had been given appropriate medication and that the nurse was taking care of him as well as he could.
按要求，病⼈不能互相串门或在楼道随意⾛动，但老人总是趁不注意跑到楼道里来，嘴里念念叨叨，总是像在找些什么。
The sick man would not be able to visit each other or move freely in the aisles, but the old man would run into the aisles and read aloud, as if he were looking for something.
护士曾经问他，「是不是找家门和床」，他说「是的」，扶他到床边休息后，但很快他又走了出来。
The nurse once asked him, "Looking for a home and bed," and he said, "Yes," and helped him to rest by the bed, but soon he came out again.
周阿姨（右一）入院首日，拖着病体在房间中不断擦拭。
Auntie Chou (right one) spent the first day on the hospital, dragging the patient around the room.
在护士长的劝说下才回到床上休息。
He was persuaded by the head nurse to go back to bed.
在病床上，周阿姨说起自己的经历失声痛哭，泪水浸湿口罩。
On the sickbed, Aunt Zhou told of her experience of crying, tears soaked in a mask.
她和父母三人被感染，丈夫和孩子被隔离。
She and her parents were infected and her husband and children were separated.
患有帕金森常年瘫痪在床的 77 岁母亲已经于家中去世，81 岁的父亲被收治在同一家医院的另一个病区，由于老人不会使用手机，无法联系。
Parkinson's 77-year-old mother, who had been paralysed in bed for years, died at home, and his 81-year-old father was hospitalized in another sick area of the same hospital, unable to communicate because he could not use a cell phone.
父亲患有糖尿病，并安装了心脏起搏器，周阿姨十分担心父亲的身体状况。
His father had diabetes and a pacemaker, and Aunt Zhou was worried about his father's health.
护士长解释，在疾病心理学中，她反复擦拭清洁房间是某种逃避机制，以机械重复的行为逃避心理创伤。
The head nurse explained that in the psychology of disease, her repeated cleaning of the room was an escape mechanism, evading psychological trauma by mechanically repeating the behavior.
随后，在护士长的帮助下，周阿姨终于和父亲联系上，才得以安心睡下。
Later, in the head nurse's help, aunt Zhou and his father finally contact, just can sleep peacefully.
这名患者反复向旁人展示舌苔，他觉得自己舌苔异样，可能是病情恶化的征兆，非常焦虑。
The patient repeatedly showed off his tongue coating, which he felt was a sign of deterioration and anxiety.
医护人员向患者解释这是口腔溃疡，给他安排了药物，并把饮食调整成了半流质。
Medical staff explained that it was an oral ulcer, gave him medication, and adjusted his diet to a semiliquid.
特殊时期，身体上细微的变化，都会引发患者的心理波动。
Special period, the slight change on the body, can cause the patient's psychological fluctuation.
刚刚入院的患者背后，贴着一张写着「确诊病人，请远离」的纸。
On the back of the patient who had just been admitted, a piece of paper was affixed with the words "Confirmed Patient, Stay Away."
该纸条为患者孙女所写，善意提醒旁人远离避免感染。
The note was written by the patient's granddaughter, reminding others to stay away from infection.
疫情到来，人与人之间都在保持安全距离，但同时也激发了陌生人之间的善意。
When the outbreak came, people kept a safe distance away from each other, but at the same time, kindled goodwill between strangers.
后来该患者安置妥当后，医护人员便将该纸条揭了下来。
When the patient was later placed, the medical staff took the note off.
医护人员将病房内的电视特意调到了综艺频道，尽量避免病患接触到疫情相关的新闻而刺激情绪。
The medical staff specially tuned the TV in the ward to the variety channel to avoid the patients' exposure to the news of the epidemic and stimulate their emotions.
在治疗阶段，与疫情相关的新闻「隔离」，保持一个相对平稳的情绪，对患者的康复尤为重要。
In the treatment phase, the news "isolation" associated with the outbreak, maintaining a relatively calm mood, is particularly important for the recovery of patients.
同病房的病友交流并不多，大多数时间只是一起看电视。
I don't talk much with my sick friends in the ward. Most of the time, I watch TV together.
尽管同为病人，但因病情轻重不同，也会担心交叉感染加重病情的可能。
Although the same patient, but due to the severity of the disease, will also worry about cross-infection aggravation of the possibility.
因此邻床病人交谈时都会拉上帘子。
So the bedside patients draw curtains when they talk to each other.
病房的玻璃上贴着福字窗花，一名病人站在落地窗前向外望去。
A patient stood in front of the floor window and looked out the window.
尽早康复出院不仅是患者最大的心愿，也是医护人员最迫切的愿望。
Early convalescence and discharge is not only the greatest wish of patients, but also the most urgent desire of medical staff.
正如医护人员在劝说病患时说的：「请和我们一起努力直到疫情结束，我们也想回家，我们也想脱下口罩畅快的呼吸。
As the paramedics said to the patient, "Please stay with us until the epidemic is over and we want to go home, too. We want to take off our masks and breathe freely."
」但在疫情尚未结束之时，医护人员依旧要日复一日地投入到救治、护理工作中。
But while the epidemic is not over, health-care workers are still working day after day on treatment and care.
同济医院光谷院区，是以收治重症患者为主的院区，在承担紧急繁重的救治任务的同时，医护人员在自我防护上也丝毫不敢疏忽。
The Guanggu courtyard area of Tongji Hospital is a hospital area for the treatment of severe patients. While undertaking the urgent and heavy task of treatment, medical staff are not afraid to neglect their self-protection.
进入病房前，戴上口罩，扣上护目镜，穿好防护服并将名字写上，成为一天当中最具仪式感的事情。
Wear a mask, wear goggles, wear protective clothing and write down your name before entering the ward. This is the most ceremonial thing of the day.
除了姓名，他们往往还会即兴涂鸦，或是心心念念的家乡美食，或是对相隔迢迢的亲人的想念，或是那些雀跃的心愿……在弥漫着疾病、恐慌和死亡气息的病房中，当防护服内的呼吸都变得粗重时，这些笔画里的轻快和乐观显得尤为珍贵。
In addition to their names, they often improvise graffiti, reminiscent home food, missed loved ones far away, or joyous wishes... The lightness and optimism of these brushes are especially valuable in wards filled with disease, panic, and death, when the breath inside becomes heavy.
「周黑鸭」、「盐水鸭」，它们分别是武汉和南京的特色食品，在这里它们有了另一重表意：一座城对另一座城的奔赴驰援，守望相助。
"Chow Black Duck" and "Salt Duck," which are characteristic food of Wuhan and Nanjing respectively, have another meaning: the rush from one city to another to help each other.
护士邢玲将两个女儿的名字写在胸口，并写道「妈妈爱你们」。
Xing Ling, a nurse, wrote the girls' names on her chest and wrote, "Mom loves you."
自疫情发生后，女儿就一直在爷爷奶奶家，邢玲从大年初三到现在一直都没见到她们。
Since the outbreak of the disease, her daughter has been at her grandparents' home, Xing Ling has not seen them since the third year of the Lunar New Year.
她说大女儿四岁半，懵懵懂懂地知道妈妈是去武汉「打病毒，打怪兽」了，二女儿两岁半，不清楚妈妈去做什么，但是一样很想妈妈。
She said the eldest daughter is four and a half years old, ignorant that her mother is going to Wuhan "hit the virus, hit monsters," the second daughter is two and a half years old, do not know what her mother to do, but also miss her mother.
情人节当天，护士周云的防护服上写着「情人节快乐」「爱你武汉」。

如今驰援武汉，一线抗疫圆了她一直以来的英雄梦。
Now galloping to Wuhan, the first line of anti-epidemic round her has been a heroic dream.
尽管每天开始工作前，医疗队成员都会利用既有的医疗物资，尽可能地做好防护准备，但每天出入「红区」，与看不见的病毒短兵相接，身处病毒高污染环境中的他们，依然是距离危险最近的人。
Although members of the medical team are prepared to take as much precautions as possible with the existing medical supplies before they begin their work each day, they are the closest to danger in terms of access to the "red zone," close to invisible viruses and exposed to high levels of virus contamination.

高感染风险下，医护人员在工作结束后都会用酒精棉签对眼部进行仔细消毒。
At high risk of infection, medical staff use alcohol cotton swab to carefully disinfect the eyes after work.
对感染的恐慌如影随形，只能用尽可能周全的防护和细致的消毒来最大限度降低感染的可能性。
Panic about infection follows, and can only be minimized with as much protection and careful disinfection as possible.
工作结束后，护士用酒精棉签擦拭耳朵进行消毒。

不透气的防护服一穿就是几个小时，一天下来往往汗湿全身。
