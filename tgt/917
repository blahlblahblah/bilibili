A2N的全称是Anti-2019-nCov，寓意“抗击新型冠状病毒”。
The full name of A2N is Anti-2019-nCov, which means "to fight the new coronavirus."
全文2632字，阅读约需5分钟武汉“90后”互联网创业者杨慧杰决定辟谣是从母亲囤积板蓝根开始的。
Wuhan "90 minutes later" Internet entrepreneur Yang Huijie decided to deny rumors from his mother hoarding Banlangen.
疫情暴发后，网上一度流传“喝板蓝根、熏醋可以预防肺炎”，虽然随后国家卫健委对此说法紧急辟谣，但谣言似乎总是跑得更快一些，1月下旬，杨慧杰的母亲已经从网上订购了大量板蓝根，还给杨慧杰寄了一批。
After the outbreak, online circulation "drink Banlangen, fumigation vinegar can prevent pneumonia," although the National Board of Health subsequently refuted this argument, rumors always seem to run faster, and in late January, Yang's mother had ordered large quantities of Banlangen online and sent a batch to Yang Huijie.
与此同时，真正有效的防护手段却还没有深入人心。
At the same time, truly effective means of protection have yet to take root.
1月20日，杨慧杰出差路过武汉高铁站，他发现，戴口罩的人只有约三分之一，密闭的车厢里更是几乎没人戴口罩。
On January 20, Yang Hui passed Wuhan High Speed Rail Station and found that only about a third of the people wearing masks were wearing masks.
杨慧杰有点着急，发了条朋友圈，他在华中科技大学的同级旧友、沪漂UI设计师L给他点了个赞。
Yang Huijie a little anxious, made a circle of friends, he in Huazhong University of Science and Technology, the same grade of former friends, Shanghai UI designer L gave him a compliment.
两人成了网络辟谣小分队A2N的创始人。
They became the founders of the network rumor team A2N.
杨慧杰告诉新京报记者，A2N的全称是Anti-2019-nCov，寓意“抗击新型冠状病毒”。
Yang told the Beijing News that the full name of A2N is "Anti-2019-nCov," which means "to fight the new coronavirus."
随着越来越多的人加入，A2N的“辟谣”工作也越来越广泛，囊括了编写科普文章，翻译国外疫情文献、医疗器械资讯，查询医院、厂商信息等诸多方面。
As more and more people join, A2N's disinformation program is becoming more and more popular, including compiling popular science articles, translating foreign epidemic literature, medical equipment information, consulting hospitals, manufacturers and so on.

受访者供图━━━━━第一篇辟谣文档阅读量超百万和杨慧杰一样，休假回到老家的L也被各种谣言乱象吵得不得安宁。
2007-9-19 15: 55 [hide] More Than One Million Dollars Like Yang Huijie, L, who returned home on leave, was disturbed by rumors.
1月22日上午，她问杨慧杰，“你有看到什么辟谣的公众号吗？谣言满天飞，真的受不了。
On the morning of January 22, she asked Yang Huijie, "Did you see any rumors of a public denigration?
”杨慧杰回复，“没有。
"Yang Huijie replied," No.
”L说，“我们开一个吧，我来开。
"Let's drive one," I'll open it.
”杨慧杰答，“好，求拉。
"Yang Huijie replied," Yes, please.
”十五分钟后，L建了一个名为“谣言粉碎机”的微信群，并在朋友圈里公布了群二维码，她写下此群的宗旨：“不散播恐慌、收集谣言、粉碎谣言、跟踪最新资讯。
Fifteen minutes later, L created a microcosm called "rumor crusher," and published a group of two-dimensional codes in a circle of friends that she wrote: "Don't spread panic, collect rumors, smash rumors, keep track of the latest information.
”他们做的第一件事是整理了一份科普、辟谣文档，分为防疫措施和常识、官方疫情通报与政策汇总、常见误区科普、辟谣专区等几个板块，每条信息的真实来源都附有链接，并在造谣图片上用红色标注了“谣言”二字以防再次传播。
The first thing they did was to sort out a copy of the popular science and rumor-fighting files, which were divided into epidemic prevention measures and common sense, official epidemic information and policy summaries, popular misinformation sections, rumor-free zones, etc., with links to the true source of each message, and using the word "rumour" in red in the rumor pictures to prevent its redissemination.
杨慧杰将文档放在石墨文档上开放编辑，这样 “所有人都能看到这个文档的实时变化，也可以去参与更新和编辑。
Yang placed the document on a graphite file for open editing, so that "everyone can see the real-time changes to the document and participate in updating and editing."
”“谣言粉碎机”微信群和这篇4273字的文档，就是A2N的雏形。
"The rumor mill" micromail group and this 4273-word document are the prototype of the A2N.
最初进群的多是杨慧杰和L在华中科技大学的校友，但短短两天内，进群人数开始爆发式增长，一个群分化出五个群，群成员迅速扩展到1000人。
In just two days, the influx of alumni from Yang Huijie and L at Huazhong University of Science and Technology began to explode, with one group dividing into five groups and rapidly expanding to 1,000 members.
与此同时，辟谣文档的阅读量也达到了105万。
At the same time, 1.05 million rumor-free files were read.
这彻底超出了杨慧杰的预期，“其实需要辟谣的人很多。
This completely exceeded Yang Huijie's expectations, "in fact the need to refute the rumor of many people.
”成员中，除了希望持续追踪辟谣信息的普通读者，还有希望成为志愿者的留学生，有医学、生物专业背景的业内人士，一线的医生、护士，政府的工作人员。
Among its members are ordinary readers who want to keep track of rumor-telling, promising international students, medical and biological professionals, front-line doctors, nurses and government workers.
一位重庆的护士专门写疫情下“哺乳期的母婴该如何防护”的科普文章，几个来自山东的程序员小伙子，希望可以为A2N后续的发展提供技术支持。
A nurse in Chongqing wrote a popular science article on "How to protect nursing mothers and babies during lactation," and several young programmers from Shandong province hope to provide technical support for the further development of A2N.
▲“谣言粉碎机”群内，志愿者正在进行讨论。
In the rumor mill group, volunteers are having a discussion.
受访者供图━━━━━明确流程和分工1月23日晚上，深圳某互联网公司“90后”产品经理火火加入了“三群”。
2007-9-24 16: 38 [hide] Clear Processes and Division of Labor On the evening of January 23, the product manager of a Shenzhen Internet company, "90 After," joined the "Three Groups."
名如其人，火火做事风风火火，雷厉风行。
You are what you are.
进入“三群”后看到的场面让她有些傻眼，“不断有谣言被贴进来，群内两三百人都在七嘴八舌地讨论，但没人组织，比较混乱。
"The scene she saw after entering the" three groups "made her a little dumbfounded." Rumors were constantly coming in, and two or three hundred people in the group were discussing it in jabber, but it was unorganized and confusing.
”作为产品经理，火火日常就习惯了对接各种需求、擅长解决问题，因此，她在群里号召，“大家把自己困惑的问题先记录下来，再统一组织看接下来该怎么办。
As a product manager, Fiery is used to docking demands and solving problems on a daily basis, so she calls out in the group, "Make a note of your puzzling problems and organize them to see what happens next.
”当天深夜，急性子的火火跟杨慧杰商量，自己先来组织“三群”。
"Later that night, the fire of the acute son and Yang Huijie to discuss, his first to organize" three groups. "
她拉来群里最活跃的三个人作为协调员，根据各自的职业属性和擅长领域分配了任务。
She drew on the three most active members of the group as coordinators, assigning tasks according to their professional attributes and areas of expertise.
一个在房地产公司做人力资源工作的男生负责搭建群内的组织架构；一个做事细致的女生负责调研群里志愿者的职业背景、期待承担的工作；另一个女生负责规划辟谣内容涉及的板块。
A male human resources officer in a real estate company is responsible for setting up the group's organizational structure; a meticulous female student is responsible for researching the professional background of the volunteers in the group and the expected work; and another is responsible for planning the sections involved in disinformation.
“相当于让他们对架构、人员、内容作一些初步设想和梳理。
"It's like asking them to make some preliminary assumptions about structure, people, content.
”第二天正是大年三十，一大早，火火和三位协调员就聚在群里开了个小型会议，会议成果是，明确了辟谣内容，主要针对新冠肺炎的科普、辟谣、捐赠信息、文献翻译、实时疫情等五个方面；明确了信息发布流程，分为谣言的收集、求证、发布三个步骤，分别选派专门的人来负责。
The next day was New Year's Eve. Early in the morning, Flaming and the three coordinators had a small meeting in the group, which resulted in a clear denial of rumour, focusing on five aspects: popularization of the crown pneumonia, denial of rumour, donation of information, translation of documents, real-time outbreak, etc.
三群讨论的成果很快被其他各群借鉴，几位群主决定，将三组总结出的五大信息确定为五个内容组，五个群分别选择自己的内容重心，同时单独开辟出志愿者统筹组、调研组、发布组等为内容组提供服务。
The results of the discussions in the three groups were quickly drawn upon by the other groups, who decided to identify the five major messages from the three clusters into five clusters, each choosing its own content focus, while creating separate volunteer groups, research groups and publishing groups to provide services to the content groups.
各组成员排班明确，每人值班一至两小时，既保证不遗漏重点信息，也不为假期增添过多的负担。
The groups were assigned clear shifts of one to two hours each, which ensured that key information was not left out and did not overburden the holidays.
2月2日夜里11点多，新京报记者注意到，群主L还在带领群成员不断进行辟谣工作。
February 2 night more than 11: 00, the Beijing News reporter noticed that the group leader L is still leading the group of members of the rumor work.
只要有一条疑似谣言被发进群中，立刻有人会被“@”，后者会迅速对接、查证，将相关可对信息进行证实或证伪的链接发入群中，有资源的其他成员会帮助核实，一切都在有条不紊地进行中。
As soon as a suspected rumor is sent into the group, someone is immediately "@," who quickly docks, verifies, links relevant to corroborating or falsifying information into the group, and other members with resources help to verify that everything is proceeding in an orderly fashion.

━━━━━优化辟谣规范通过几天的摸索，辟谣小分队在不断优化着辟谣规范。
---Optimizing the rumor-free norm Through a few days of groping, the rumor-free sub-units are constantly optimizing the rumor-fighting norms.
火火告诉新京报记者，“第一优先级是联系当事人本人，打电话去求证；如果联系不到就去看官媒，相信政府网站和人民日报、央视这样的官方媒体；第三再去看一些具有权威性的意见领袖发布的信息，每一步我们都要写清来源。
"The first priority is to contact the person concerned and call for evidence," he told the Beijing News. "If you can't reach them, go to the state media, trust government websites and official media such as People's Daily and CCTV.
”1月29日晚间，微信朋友圈里流传一段视频，一位男子在顺丰速运营业点，声称自己拦截了一批N95口罩叫卖。
During the night of January 29, Weixin friends circulated a video of a man at a thriving business site claiming to have stopped a consignment of N95 masks for sale.
火火的一位朋友刚好在当地顺丰公司工作，她向朋友询问，了解到并无此事，是视频中的男子自导自演。
A friend of Flaming, who happened to be working for a local Shunfeng company, asked a friend if she knew there was no such thing.
第二天，盘龙公安局也发布警情通报，称该男子在寄件期间看到营业厅内摆放的口罩，编造虚假视频上传，已进行处罚。
The next day, the Panlong Public Security Bureau also issued a police notice, said the man saw the business hall put in the mask, fabricated false video upload, has been punished.
1月31日，网上有传言称，武汉市第八人民医院扩充了大量病床，让找不到床位的患者尽快过去。
On January 31, rumors spread online that Wuhan's Eighth People's Hospital had expanded the number of beds so that those who could not find beds could do so as soon as possible.
辟谣小分队的一位志愿者刚好认识相关负责人，他打电话核实后确认是假消息，对方表示，要赶紧辟谣，“否则八院要瘫痪了。
One of the volunteers in the rumor-fighting team happened to know the person in charge. He called to check and confirm that the information was false.
”获取了这些辟谣信息后，文档组的志愿者会将其录入文档，随后由发布组的志愿者同步在微博、微信公众号等平台上。
Once you get these rumor-free messages, the volunteers in the documentation group type them into the documentation, which is then synchronized by the volunteers in the publishing group on platforms such as Weibo and Micromessage Public.

一位媒体朋友告诉他们，要警惕一种具有“时效性”的谣言。
A media friend told them to beware of a "time-sensitive" rumor.
疫情变化迅速，有些政策在头一天还是传闻、谣言，但第二天就真的启动了。
The epidemic has changed rapidly, with some policies rumored and rumoured the first day, but the next day it did.
“对于这种信息，我们在辟谣时要标记日期，否则过了那个时间点，辟谣也成了谣言。
"We mark the date when we deny the rumor, or after that point in time, disinformation becomes a rumor.
”火火说。
'she said.
也不是所有的谣言都能被“辟谣”。
Not all rumors can be dismissed.
新京报记者获得的一份辟谣小分队“内部日报”显示，截至2月1日24时，例行信息收集累计274条，当日（2月1日）新增谣言33条，完整辟谣求证9条。
As of 2400 hours on February 1, 274 routine information collections had been collected, 33 new rumors had been added on the same day (February 1), and nine full rumors had been denied, according to an inner daily newspaper obtained by the Beijing News.
” 火火透露，正常情况下，辟谣率在60%左右。
Under normal circumstances, the rumor-telling rate is around 60 per cent, the report said.
目前，辟谣小分队正努力的扩大传播范围，“就算我一篇文档浏览量有100万，但这100万可能只是年轻人，老年人、偏远地区的人，他们认知仍然是不够的。
At the moment, rumor teams are trying to spread the word: "Even if I have a million page views, this one million people may be young, old, remote, and still don't know enough.
