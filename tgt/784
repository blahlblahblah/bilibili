深度和角度——这就是我们能做的。

在这样一场灾难中，如何保障人的尊严、人之为人的根本，已经成为每一个作家必须面对的问题。
In such a disaster, how to safeguard human dignity and the fundamental of human beings has become a problem that every writer must face.
口述 |李修文整理|何映宇武汉封城的第二天，我原本准备一早就回湖北荆门老家过春节。
Li Xiuwen Li & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
我也没想到会封城啊，结果就走不了了。
I didn't expect it to be closed, so I couldn't leave.
我老家也有几百例感染新型肺炎，我父母的情况我也非常担心，但我没有办法，现在只能是“一种相思，两地哀愁”。
I have hundreds of cases of new pneumonia in my hometown, and I am very worried about my parents, but I have no choice but to "love each other and grieve in both places."
我的生活习惯平常晚上睡得很晚，因为原本第二天要回老家，我就早睡了，准备第二天早起，谁想得到凌晨2:00发了通知要封城。
I usually go to bed late at night because I am going back home the next day. I go to bed early and get up early the next day.
既然走不了，那就买了很多菜，囤积着，以备未来之需，一直吃到今天。
Since can not walk, then bought a lot of dishes, hoarded, in case of future needs, until today.
迄今为止，我已经14天没有外出了。
So far, I haven't been out for 14 days.
现在武汉大街上基本上空无一人，只有仅剩的几家药店还开着。
Wuhan streets are now almost empty, only the few pharmacies left open.
最恐慌的是现在我楼下就有疑似感染的病人。
The most frightening thing is that I have a patient downstairs with a suspected infection.
好多朋友说要给寄东西，我说不要了，我们这栋楼有了病例，如果快递小哥再被感染了，那就会影响更多人。
Many friends said to send things, I said no, we have a case in this building, if the courier brother is infected again, it will affect more people.
这不已经有新闻报道快递小哥被感染上了吗？现在武汉唯一还有的快递就是顺丰，顺丰小哥到我们这的时候，我会跟他们说，你进我们小区不要进我们这栋楼，因为已经有了疑似病例。
Now the only express delivery in Wuhan is Shunfeng. When Shunfeng Brother comes to us, I will tell them that you don't come into our district, because there is a suspected case.
最恐慌的是现在！你知道恐惧也是分层的，前一天的恐惧和今天的恐惧是不一样的。
The most frightening thing is the present! You know fear is stratified, too. The fear of the day before is not the same as the fear of today.
老实说我前两天并没有觉得多么恐惧，但是现在我明显地感到了大家的恐惧在升温！因为大家都不知道什么时候是个头！我们湖北通知的是2月14日上班，我认为可能做不到，即使是坐班的话，也可能是极少数一部分人。
To be honest, I didn't feel so scared the other day, but now I clearly feel the fear rising! Because no one knows when it is! We in Hubei Province have reported for work on Feb. 14, and I think it may not be possible, even on duty, for a very small minority.
目前看来，我们还要做好长期的准备，我们要有这样的心理准备。
At the moment, we have to be prepared for the long term, and we need to be prepared for that.
我个人非常反感朋友圈里“把武汉还给我们，把我们还给武汉”这样的口号，它们忽略冒犯的是一个个个人的具体处境。
I personally resent the slogan "Give Wuhan back to us, we back to Wuhan" in the circle of friends who ignore the specific situation of each individual.
此时此刻，还有多少人住不上医院，还奔走在各大医院之间？他们是该指责的对象吗？这难道不是求生的本能吗？如果我有了疑似的症状，今天住不上医院，那我明天早上要不要去看看能不能住院？那他不就成了移动的病毒传播者了吗？可是，这能怪他吗？我绝不会像有些人那样说什么他们就应该呆在家里，不应该跑出去把病传染给别人，如果那样的话就没有天理了，那人之为人的基本条件都全部摧毁了！他可以被隔离，呆在家里，但要有人管他啊！就我所了解的情况，我身边认识的人得病的越来越多，离我们自身越来越近。
At the moment, how many people can't go to the hospital and run between the major hospitals? Isn't that the instinct for survival? If I have suspected symptoms and can't live in hospital today, will I have to go to the hospital tomorrow morning? But can I blame him?
我前两天还可以下下楼，这两天我怎么下楼呢？前两天还可以通风，这两天怎么通风呢？我楼下就有了几个疑似病例。
I can go downstairs two days ago, how can I go downstairs these two days? The first two days can also be ventilated, these two days how ventilation? I have a few suspected cases downstairs.
因为还没有做上核酸检测，只能居家隔离。
Because they haven't been tested for nucleic acids, they can only be isolated at home.
在我看来，这样的办法是非常非常有问题的，这不就是闭上眼睛骗自己吗？人是有求生本能的，有人会守在自己的家里等着病情加重，甚至等来自己的死亡吗？人的求生本能必然要求他出门为自己的生存呼喊，而在求救的过程中，他也可能成为一个传染源。
In my opinion, such an approach is very, very problematic, is it not to close their eyes to deceive themselves? People have survival instinct, people will wait in their homes to get worse, even when their own death?
即使要隔离，也应该像昨天下的通知那样，及早地征召宾馆、体育馆等场馆。
Even if you want to isolate, you should call up hotels, stadiums and other venues as early as yesterday's announcement.
武汉现在号召“社区负责制”，但实际上社区做不到，因为防控是一个专业性很强的事，如果没有专业人士来负责，因此我认为实际上这是无效的。
Wuhan now calls for "community responsibility," but in reality the community cannot because prevention and control is a highly professional matter, and if there are no professionals responsible, I think it is not effective in practice.
现在唯一可信的就是仪器，仪器在医院，当然就要奔向医院了。
Now the only credible instrument, the instrument in the hospital, of course, to run to the hospital.
所以只能苦熬。
So I had to endure.
我的心是乱的，现在没法写作我觉得现在武汉缺乏一种清晰而有力量的声音，在巨大的恐惧和困惑之下，所有的人都在猜疑和苦熬。
My heart is in disorder, now unable to write I feel that Wuhan now lacks a clear and powerful voice, in the great fear and confusion, all people are in suspicion and suffering.
如果有人得了病，他会不断回忆自己曾经与谁接触过导致自己被感染，长此以往，心理上肯定会出问题。
If someone gets sick, he remembers constantly who he has been in contact with that led to his infection, and in the long run, there will be a psychological problem.
现在我不知道我们接下来还要封闭多久，很难对时间做出某种规划。
Now I don't know how long we're going to be closed. It's hard to make some sort of time plan.
事实上，在这样的心态下，我什么都做不了。
In fact, in such a state of mind, I can do nothing.
我是个作家，很多人说你可以写作啊，那怎么可能？生活已经把你打回了原形，水落石出之时，你就要承担一个人在这样一个境遇下的职责，尽一个人的本分。
I am a writer, and many people say you can write, how is that possible? Life has beaten you back into shape, and when it is out of the question, you will assume the duties of a man under such circumstances, and do one's duty.
至于写作，那是以后的事，而且我认为灾难文学的唯一伦理，就是反思灾难。
As for writing, that is later, and I think the only ethic of disaster literature is to reflect on disaster.
封城之前，元月四日我去南宁出差，同行的一个青年作家对我说，情况可能比较糟，当然他可能也只是一种直觉，谁也料不到情况会恶化成这样。
Before the closure of the city, I went to Nanning on a business trip on January 4th. A young writer in the same line told me that the situation might be worse.
那天我戴着口罩去的南宁，到了南宁晚上喝酒的时候，大家还笑话我说你果然来自疫区啊。
The other day I went to Nanning wearing a mask, to Nanning at night when drinking, people joke that you really came from the epidemic area.
回来之后开两会，市里开完省里又开，这么大型的集会，大家就觉得这应该没事了啊。
After the two meetings back, the city opened again after the provincial meeting, such a large rally, we feel that this should be all right.
我们都没有想到疫情会发散和扩展到这样的地步。
We did not expect the outbreak to spread and spread to this point.
这一次的疫情，传染性太强，潜伏期太长，这就是它比SARS可怕的地方，传染者他不发热也没有其它症状你怎么知道他被感染了呢？我特别觉得这次灾难中的年轻人非常可怜，比如说我认识的一个年轻人，他大年三十的晚上就已经发烧了，高度疑似。
This time, the epidemic is too contagious, the incubation period is too long, this is it is more terrible than SARS, infector He has no fever and no other symptoms How do you know he was infected?
到我们这个年纪，在这座城市中，多多少少有点资源，可是年轻人不一样，他们刚到武汉没多久，20来岁，刚刚毕业，刚刚结婚，如果又是外地来武汉的人员，他们在武汉的人脉资源就更要比我们少得多，他们还没有享受这座城市给予他们的便利，就遇到了这样的灾难，很容易就乱了方寸。
At our age, in this city, there are more or less resources, but young people are different, they have just arrived in Wuhan, some 20 years old, just graduated, just married, if the people from outside Wuhan, their network resources in Wuhan is much less, they have not enjoyed the facilities given to them by this city, it is easy to get lost.
生了病没有办法确诊，没有办法住院，他们内心的焦虑、压力你都能感同身受，可以说是走投无路。
There is no way to diagnose the disease, no way to hospitalization, their inner anxiety, stress you can empathize with, can be said to be desperate.
一个大学老师，她的老公和父母都已经感染了，好像父亲已经去世了，她自己也高度疑似。
A college teacher, her husband and parents have been infected, as if the father has died, she is highly suspected.
在封城的情况下，她半岁的孩子谁来带？她发出的求救之声多么悲哀，已经不是救她的命，而是谁来救他们的孩子的问题了。
In the case of the siege, who would bring her half-year-old child? How mournful her cries for help were, not to save her life, but to save their children.
看见的听见的全是生离死别啊！我很反感一种说法：“武汉按下了暂停键。
What I saw and heard was all parting! I resented the idea that Wuhan had pressed the pause button.
”这是暂停键的问题吗？好像恢复了暂停键，一切就都恢复正常了似的。
Is it a question of pausing the key? It looks as if the pause key has been restored and everything is back to normal.
2008年汶川大地震的时候，我去过汶川，我的一个巨大的感受就是：创伤将永远停留在它遭到创伤的地方，一辈子都无法弥补！本来确实打算写点东西，但实际上根本做不到。
When the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008, I went to Wenchuan, one of my great feelings is that the trauma will always stay in its traumatic place, a lifetime irreparable!
尤其我在网上看到一个视频：殡葬车在前面开，一个小女孩在后面跟着喊着妈妈妈妈。
In particular, I saw a video on the Internet: the funeral car was driving in front, a little girl followed by a mother called mother.
看到这个视频，我就受不了了，我的心特别乱。
Seeing this video, I couldn't take it anymore. My heart was so messy.
我所在的小区比较大，有一天我还听到一个中年男子在喊妈妈，那天又下着雨，真是“昔日戏言身后意，今朝都到眼前来”，它迫近得太厉害！那天以后我的心都是乱的，也没法写作，也读不进书了。
One day I heard a middle-aged man calling to his mother, and it rained that day. It was a "joke behind us, now we are all here today." It was so close after that day that my heart was in disorder, unable to write or read books.
我认识的朋友染病的越来越多，所以接到的求救也越来越多。
Friends I know get sick more and more, so they get more and more calls for help.
我的同事、熟人，不管是疑似还是确诊的，我尽可能帮他们做做协调：怎么样能做上检测，怎么样才能住进医院。
My colleagues and acquaintances, whether they were suspicious or diagnosed, tried to help them coordinate how they could be tested and hospitalized.
但是前几天还有些医院的朋友可以帮帮忙，这两天根本就不行了，连医院里的医生、护士自己得病了都住不上。
But a few days ago there are some hospital friends can help, these two days can not at all, even the hospital doctors, nurses themselves sick can not live.
这真是真实的绝望。
This is true despair.
我倒没有那么矫情地说什么“写诗是可耻的”，但确实，个人生活和个人内心的一道分水岭已经产生了，所以你很难再像过去一样生活。
I'm not so affectionate as to say that "it's shameful to write poetry," but it's true that a watershed has been created between one's life and one's heart, so it's hard to live as you did in the past.
我有些医护朋友，我每天都和他们聊聊天。
I have some health care friends, and I talk to them every day.
我有个特别好的朋友，是协和医院的护士长，他们自己缺防护服，防护服根本不敢脱。
I have a particularly good friend who is the matron of Concorde Hospital. They lack protective clothing and dare not take it off at all.
湖北省红十字会的情况我不是很了解，但是协和医院缺防护用品是千真万确的。
I don't know much about the Red Cross Society in Hubei Province, but it's true that Concorde Hospital lacks protective equipment.
有一天，她中午给我发了个微信语音，说她女儿在北京没有口罩，问我能不能帮忙解决。
One day, she sent me a message at noon saying her daughter had no face masks in Beijing and asked if I could help.
我也没办法，我是有口罩，但是我也寄不出去。
I can't help it. I have a mask, but I can't send it.
后来我就叫我的朋友们，几个几个的口罩给她女儿寄过去。
Then I called my friends, and several masks were sent to her daughter.
至于红十字会的情况，我也是通过朋友圈了解到的，真实的情况我不是很了解，但它至少影响了我一个选择，我现在也做不了什么，唯一能做的可能也就是捐助一点钱，那现在我肯定要重新考虑我的选择。
As far as the Red Cross is concerned, I have learned from my circle of friends that the real situation is not very clear to me, but it has at least influenced my choice, and I can't do anything right now. The only thing that can be done is to donate a little money.
加缪《鼠疫》我经常读，但是我不太喜欢那种通过一部小说来认识一个民族的处境。
Camus Plague I often read, but I do not much like the idea of a novel to understand the situation of a people.
我觉得我们现在的问题都在鲁迅先生的笔下被展现被揭露过。
It seems to me that our present problems have been exposed in the writings of Mr. Lu Xun.
我有一个非常深的印象，双黄连可以抑制新型肺炎病毒的新闻出来后，网上一下子冒出来很多嘲笑购买双黄连的人的智商的各种段子，我看完以后特别愤怒！你和他们难道不都是可怜人吗？嘲笑他们，你和那些吃人血馒头的人有什么区别呢？嘲笑一个和你一样悲惨的人，和鲁迅先生笔下批判的人们有什么不一样呢？我们如何通往自己的现代性，固然跟我们这个国家这个民族有关，更和这个国家这个民族里面具体的人有关。
I have a deep impression that Shuanghuanglian can suppress the news of the new pneumonia virus, a lot of ridicule of the purchase of the intelligence quotient of Shuang Huanglian came out on the Internet.
我们每个人都该承担起自己的责任来了，每个人都应该尽可能地做好自己这个人，否则就是几千年的悲剧不断循环往复，事实上，像这样的事历史上一再重演过。
It is time for each of us to shoulder our responsibilities, to be as good as we can be, or else for thousands of years of tragedy, in fact, something like this has been repeated over and over again in history.
宁浩导演很担心我，每天都会和我通电话或者微信联络。
Director Ning Hao is very worried about me and will talk to me by phone or by microphone every day.
我记得当初拍《疯狂的外星人》的时候，大家还说，中国人是我们拍的这样吗？为什么不去拍《战狼》这样的电影呢？《疯狂的外星人》本质上是通过科幻的外衣来反思中国国民性的一部电影。
I remember when I was filming Alien Crazy, people said, 'Do we make the Chinese like this? Why not make movies like Wolf?' The Crazy Alien 'is essentially a film about the character of China through science fiction.
它还是走在鲁迅先生所开创的道路上，刻画人物的时候，我们脑子里想的，就是这个人物的身上有没有阿Q的影子。
It is still walking in the road opened by Mr. Lu Xun, depicting characters, we have in mind, is that there is no Ah Q shadow of this character.
我觉得我们现在真的要重新从鲁迅出发，反思中国人的国民性，无论在灾难之中，还是在灾难之后。
I think we should really start from Lu Xun now and reflect on the national character of the Chinese people, whether in the disaster or after the disaster.
我觉得经此一劫，它可能成为中国作家重新出发的一个起点。
I think it may become a starting point for Chinese writers to start afresh.
很多作家在写目前的灾难，但我写不了，就算要写，也希望自己多一些冷静和理智，就像我刚才讲的：灾难文学的唯一伦理，就是反思灾难。
Many writers are writing about current catastrophes, but I cannot write them, and even if I do, I wish I had a little more soberness and reason, as I said earlier: the only ethic of disaster literature is to reflect on disaster.
在这样一场灾难中，如何保障人的尊严、人之为人的根本，已经成为每一个作家必须面对的问题。
In such a disaster, how to safeguard human dignity and the fundamental of human beings has become a problem that every writer must face.
