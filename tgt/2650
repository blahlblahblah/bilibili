澎湃新闻记者 胡丹萍手术在无锡市传染病医院的负压手术室中施行2月29日，“我国肺移植第一人”、著名肺移植专家陈静瑜教授团队历经5个小时在江苏无锡成功进行全球首例新冠肺炎病例双肺移植手术。
Chinese lung transplant specialist Chen Jingyu, the premier lung transplant specialist, successfully performed the world's first two-lung transplant in Wuxi, Jiangsu province, on Feb. 29, 2007.
3月1日，陈静瑜在接澎湃新闻（www.thepaper.cn）专访时表示，这名新冠肺炎患者双肺功能已严重受损，在对这名危重症患者进行综合的手术指征评价后，他和团队冒了很大的风险来进行这样一台探索性手术，就是为了更多的新冠肺炎危重症的病人和濒临死亡的病人，给他们一个生的希望。
On March 1, Chen Jing Yu said in an interview with the roaring news (www.thepper.cn) that the patient's lung function had been severely impaired. After a comprehensive surgical assessment of the critically ill patient, he and his team took great risks for an exploratory operation to give more patients with severe coronary pneumonia and dying patients a chance to live.
对话陈静瑜澎湃新闻：请您介绍一下进行这例肺移植患者的情况。
Dialogue Chen Jingyu: Could you tell me something about this lung transplant patient?
陈静瑜：该新冠肺炎病例在江苏省，男，59岁，1月23日发病，1月26日确诊COVID-19，2月7日气管插管，2月22日ECMO，2月24日转至无锡市传染病医院，病人经气管插管加上ECMO（体外膜肺氧合，俗称人工肺）和药物治疗后，连续核酸检测呈阴性，但双肺功能已严重受损且不可逆。
Chen Jing-yu: The case of pneumonia in Jiangsu Province, male, 59, January 23, confirmed COVID-19, February 7 tracheal intubation, February 24 to Wuxi Infectious Disease Hospital, patients through trachea intubation plus ECMO (External Membrane Pulmonary Oxygen, commonly known as Artificial Lung) and medication, but both lung functions have been severely impaired and irreversible.
澎湃新闻：新冠肺炎患者要进行肺移植的医学指征有哪些？首例新冠肺炎肺移植患者手术前的情况怎么样？陈静瑜：一是病人经呼吸机加上ECMO维持，双肺呼吸衰竭不可逆；二是核酸检测连续多次呈阴性；三是其他脏器功能基本正常，全身状况能够承受肺移植手术。
What are the medical indications for lung transplantation in patients with new crown pneumonia? Chen Jingyu: First, patients with respiratory failure sustained by ventilator and ECMO are irreversible; second, nucleic acid testing is negative for many times; third, other organs function normally and the whole body is able to withstand lung transplantation.
在做肺移植手术之前这个病人已经通过呼吸机和ECMO维持了其他器官正常，但是他的肺已经是晚期的状态，肺纤维化，而且萎缩成了一个豆腐干一样了，所以才进行肺移植的。
Prior to the lung transplant, the patient had maintained normal organs through a respirator and ECMO, but his lungs were in a state of advanced stage, pulmonary fibrosis, and had contracted into a tofu-dried form, so lung transplantation was carried out.
还有一个状况就是在2月28日，患者因为右侧病肺内持续出血，量估计有2500ml，患者出血性休克已在濒死状况，29日这个患者幸运地等到外省脑死亡病人爱心捐献肺源，我们团队才可以奋力一博。
On Feb. 28, the patient was bleeding continuously in his right lung, estimated at 2,500 ml, and his hemorrhagic shock was on the verge of death. On Feb. 29, the patient was lucky enough to wait until the brain-dead in the province donated their lungs.
澎湃新闻：您提到进行肺移植需要核酸检测连续多次呈阴性，原因是什么？这个首例肺移植的新冠肺炎患者进行了多少次核酸检测？陈静瑜：这个病人连续五天的核酸检测都是阴性才做的手术。
Peng Pai: Why did you mention that DNA tests were negative for lung transplants? How many nucleic acid tests were performed on this first lung transplant patient? Chen Jingyu: The patient underwent five consecutive negative nucleic acid tests.
新冠病毒是一个呼吸道传染的病毒，传染性特别强。
The New Crown Virus is a respiratory infectious virus that is particularly infectious.
大家对这个病毒的研究和认识都不够。
There is not enough research and understanding of the virus.
但是目前可以确定的是对新冠病毒进行核酸检测呈阳性意味着病毒在体内还是活动期。
But what is certain is that testing the new crown virus for nucleic acid positive means that the virus is in the body or active.
所以为了更好的完成这个手术，从医护人员安全的角度来讲，我们希望患者是没有传染性，最好连续几天检测核酸结果都是阴性了，这样的话相对还是比较安全的。
So in order to better complete the operation, from the point of view of health-care safety, we hope that the patient is not infectious, it is best to test nucleic acid results negative for a few days in a row, which is relatively safe.
但是核酸检测阴性也不能够排除手术要摘下来的病肺里面没有病毒存在，所以我们在做手术时需要做严格的防护，确保医护人员零感染。
But a negative nucleic acid test does not rule out that there is no virus in the lung that is to be removed, so we need to take strict precautions during surgery to ensure that there is no infection among the medical staff.
澎湃新闻：新冠肺炎患者肺移植，与其他疾病导致需要肺移植的患者，在后续的康复治疗上有哪些异同？康复难度会不会更大？陈静瑜：这个患者的肺移植后的康复之路肯定比别的普通肺纤维化的病人要长，因为他前期受的磨难太多了，他的免疫功能是很低的，康复时间肯定比别人长。
Chen Jing-yu: What are the similarities and differences between lung transplantation and other diseases in patients who need lung transplants? Chen Jingyu: This patient must have a longer recovery path after a lung transplant than any other patient with normal pulmonary fibrosis because he has had too much pain in the early stages, his immune function is low and he will certainly recover longer than others.
而且可能会有别的意外我们都不知道，所以这个手术是一个探索性的手术。
And there may be other surprises that we don't know about, so this operation is an exploratory one.
澎湃新闻：为什么要进行这样一个探索性手术？陈静瑜：因为新冠肺炎重症患者死亡率太高了。
Peng Pai News: Why an exploratory operation like this? Chen Jingyu: Because the death rate in patients with severe coronary pneumonia is too high.
目前装了呼吸机加上ECMO的患者抢救成功率很低。
The success rate of patients with ventilator and ECMO is very low.
我们团队冒了很大的风险来做这个手术，实际上就是为危重症的病人和濒临死亡的病人，给他们一个生的希望。
Our team took a big risk to do this operation, in effect giving the critically ill and dying a chance to live.
我们也希望通过我们这个案例能够得到一些经验，就像做尸体解剖是一样的道理。
We also hope to gain some experience in our case, just as it is with autopsies.
跟尸体解剖相比较的话，我觉得这个手术更有意义，因为尸体解剖是患者死后去看，而我们不仅要去拯救患者的生命，同时也可以从他病肺上能够得到对疾病的认识。
Compared to autopsies, I think it makes more sense because autopsies are done after the death of a patient, and we have to save the patient's life, but also to learn about the disease from his diseased lungs.
澎湃新闻：我们看到湖北卫健委今天发布的数据显示，湖北2月29日还有新冠肺炎重症病例7107例，如果肺移植有效，您作为医生同时也是全国人大代表，对于湖北重症患者救治有怎样的建议？陈静瑜：接下来我们能够做成功的话，我就会建议国家卫健委组织一个针对新冠肺炎患者的肺移植攻关团队，把器官移植和免疫学的人员都召集起来，组织一个团队，把武汉危重症病人统一起来选择合适的肺移植受者，成功率高的、年轻一点的患者，比如二三十岁、四五十岁的年轻危重症新冠肺炎患者进行肺移植救治。
If the lung transplantation is effective, what advice do you have as a doctor and deputy to the National People's Congress for treating patients with serious diseases in Hubei Province? Chen Jingyu: If we can do this successfully, I will suggest that the National Health Council organize a team to select suitable lung transplant recipients, such as those in their 20s, 30s, 40s and 50s.
澎湃新闻：您指的在肺移植成功以后会向有关部门提出建议，时间节点是什么时候？目前这名进行移植的患者情况如何？陈静瑜：目前这个病人情况平稳，我指的成功要等这个患者的呼吸机和ECMO能够完整撤离以后，病人能够进行康复锻炼的时候就是一个初步的成功。
Pai Mei News: When is the time node when you are referring to the successful lung transplant? Chen Jingyu: The patient is now in stable condition. I mean the success will be when the patient's ventilator and ECMO can be fully evacuated.
目前来看大概需要等几天时间都可以撤下了，到时候我就可以有一个预判。
At the moment it will probably take a few days to get it down, and then I can have a prejudgement.
澎湃新闻：对于进行手术的医护人员来说，进行新冠肺炎患者肺移植手术的风险有多大？在首例患者的手术中遇到了哪些难题？陈静瑜：风险很大，我不知道患者的肺里面是不是含残留的病毒，病毒是否有活性、有传染性，所以我们在全套武装防护条件下来做这个手术，对医生来说心理压力很大。
Chen Jing-yu: I don't know if there is any residual virus in the patient's lungs, whether the virus is active or contagious, so we have to do it under full armed conditions, which can be very stressful for doctors.
在操作上也更困难，团队之间不好讲话，眼神又没交流，基本上大家出一身汗，五六个小时下来，只能靠团队紧密的配合，大家相互之间长期达成的一个默契，才能把这个手术做下来。
It is also more difficult to operate, the team is not easy to speak, the eyes do not communicate, basically all sweaty, five or six hours down, can only rely on the close cooperation of the team, we have long reached a tacit understanding between each other, so that the operation can be done.
因为我们完成了1000多例的肺移植手术了，所以这个手术平时就是一个常规手术，我们一般两三天就做一台肺移植手术算是家常便饭，整个团队默契配合能力都已经非常强了。
Since we have performed more than 1,000 lung transplants, this is usually a routine operation, and we usually have a lung transplant two or three days later.
所以对我们来讲，这一台手术没有特别延长手术时间，基本上还是非常快完成了。
So for us, this operation did not specifically extend the operation time, or basically very quickly completed.
