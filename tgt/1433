姐妹，前线的卫生巾和安心裤还够吗？文｜潘迪12月6日晚，梁钰刷着微博，看到疫区的医生护士为了节约防护服，数小时都不进食、尽量不去厕所的新闻，一个问题立刻浮现出来：“那她们来了例假怎么办？”而在这次一线的医护人员中，女性占了很大的比例。
Sisters, are there enough sanitary towels and comfort pants on the frontline? Leung Yubru Weibo on the night of December 6, when she saw news that doctors and nurses in affected areas were trying not to eat or use the toilet for hours to save on protective clothing.
于是她在微博上问：“前线医护人员的卫生巾和考拉裤还够吗？”这条微博被转发了两百多次，和很多疫情相关的话题相比，不算多，但是评论区十分踊跃，许多人对她的担忧表示理解，还认真讨论卫生棉条、月经杯、短效避孕药等女性用品在疫区的实用性。
"Are frontline paramedics' sanitary towels and koalas enough?" The post was relayed more than 200 times, compared to many epidemic-related topics, but the comment area was full, many people understood her concerns and discussed the practicality of sanitary napkins, menstrual cups, short-acting contraceptives and other female products in affected areas.
第二天，梁钰在微博上打出了＃姐妹战疫安心行动＃的话题，呼吁网友关注一线女性医护生理期问题。
The next day, Liang Yu in micro-blog played a Personality of Action # # sister plague reassurance call netizens to pay attention to the issue of first-line female medical physiology.
同时，她从卫健委网站查询信息，给湖北的几家医院打电话，询问他们的需求。
At the same time, she asked for information from the Weijian committee's website and called several hospitals in Hubei province to ask about their needs.
当时，她只是想和几位朋友一起做点个人捐赠。
At the time, she just wanted to make a personal donation with some friends.
她们想捐赠安心裤，这一女性用品相当于结合了一次性内裤和卫生巾，比卫生巾使用时长更久，考拉裤是其中的一种。
They want to donate comfort pants, the equivalent of a combination of disposable underwear and sanitary towels, longer than sanitary towels, of which koalas are one.
但事态的发展很快超出梁钰的预期。
But the development of events quickly exceeded Liang Yu's expectations.
2月7日当天，就有不止一家品牌向她寻求合作，各地的医护人员也发来私信。
On February 7, she was approached by more than one brand, and private letters were received from health-care workers everywhere.
有黄冈某定点医院的医生为160名出不了隔离区的女医护求助，“和领导申请了也一直没落实”；有人代支援方舱医院的朋友求安心裤，还问梁钰能否帮忙代买秋衣秋裤短袖，“她们出门连换洗衣服都没来得及带，要光膀子了。
A doctor at a designated hospital in Huanggang asked 160 female medical workers who could not get out of the quarantine area, "and the leader applied for comfort pants." Some asked Liang Yu if he could help buy autumn coats and autumn trousers.
”需要联系和咨询的人太多，2月7日到11日，梁钰共睡了11小时，醒着的时间都在与一线医护、医院领导和各类有意向的企业沟通，“至少上百人吧，”她估计。
"So many people need to be contacted and consulted." Liang Yu slept 11 hours from Feb. 7 to 11 and spent waking hours communicating with front-line health care, hospital leaders and interested companies, "at least a hundred people," she estimates.
捐赠的进展也快得超乎她想象，从2月7日白天到9日夜里，梁钰和朋友共牵头定点捐赠超过71万元的物资、超过11万条安心裤，覆盖了武汉、黄冈、孝感的20家医院。
Donations also progressed faster than she had imagined. From the night of February 7 to 9, Liang Yu and his friends led a total of more than 710,000 yuan in targeted donations and over 110,000 pairs of trousers, covering 20 hospitals in Wuhan, Huanggang and Xiaogan.
开始募捐后，梁钰才发现疫区女性用品的缺口有多大。
After the fund-raising, Liang found out how big the gap was for female products in the affected areas.
“我同事今天血跟尿都混在一起了，太难了。
"My colleagues have mixed up blood and urine today. It's too difficult.
”这是她2月11日晚间收到的一条微博私信，一位江汉方舱医院海南志愿队的护士替两位来例假的同事急求安心裤。
"It was a private Weibo letter she received on the night of February 11, and a nurse from the Hainan Volunteer Corps at Jiang Han cabin hospital was panting for the comfort of two colleagues who had come on official holidays.
2月12日凌晨，梁钰终于找到了一个武汉志愿者笛子，当时小区已经封了，禁止出入，笛子一早翻墙出了小区，跑了整整半天，才找到物资，买了送去方舱医院。
February 12, the early morning, Liang Yu finally found a Wuhan volunteers flute, when the community has been closed, out of the area, the flute early in the wall, ran for a whole day, before finding supplies, bought to the cabin hospital.
梁钰今年24岁，个人微博@梁钰stacey有约27万关注者。
Liang Yu, 24, has about 270,000 followers on personal microblog @ Leung Yu-stacey.
过去几年，她在微博上常参与讨论各类性别议题，言语爽利地与持男权观点的网民辩论交锋，时时对性别歧视的言论给予迎头痛击。
Over the past few years, she has been involved in discussions on various gender issues on Weibo, engaging in forthright debates with male-dominated netizens, and at times attacking sexist remarks.
疫情发生后，她也数次带着＃看见女性劳动者＃的话题转发一线女性医护的新闻，呼吁媒体对“男女战士”给予“同等的尊重和报道”。
On several occasions since the outbreak, she has relayed news of frontline women's health care with the persona of female workers, calling on the media to give "equal respect and coverage" to "men and women fighters."
“我觉得这是很自然的事情，男的不也是关注他们的权利？”梁钰在电话里对我说。
"I think this is very natural thing, not men are also concerned about their rights?" Liang Yu told me on the phone.
这时是晚上11点，她刚和志愿者团队开完会，讨论了优化流程的问题，声音沙哑。
It was 11 p. m., and she had just finished a meeting with the volunteer team to discuss optimizing the process, with a husky voice.
但她精力不错，语速很快，“小时候接受过教育自然而然就知道，我是应该受到保护的，但是这个社会好像跟法律规定的不大一样。
But she had a good energy and spoke quickly. "An education as a child naturally taught me that I was entitled to protection, but this society seemed very different from the one prescribed by law.
不过好像男性无所谓，没有人会去侵犯他们的权益，就让我觉得很困惑。
But as if men do not matter, no one will infringe on their rights and interests, let me feel very confused.
”梁钰说。
'said Mr. Leung.
＃姐妹战疫安心行动＃的关注度越来越大，质疑也随之而来：有人觉得女性健康用品不是疫区最急缺的物资，要先考虑国家大事；有人直指她的动机不纯；还有人说她在网上呼吁太折腾，建议不如她自己打钱，让一线医护自己到超市采购。
Personality Trait # # The Sisters in War Campaign got more attention and questioning: some people felt that women's health supplies were not the most urgently needed items in affected areas, and some pointed to her motives as impure; others said she was calling for too much online and suggested that she might as well send front-line care to the supermarket for her own purchase.
在微博上，梁钰流露过几次情绪激烈的时刻。
On Weibo, Liang Yu has expressed several emotional moments.
一次是2月9日，她主动向金银潭医院提出捐赠，对方表示“我们其实急缺专业防护用品，这个不急的”，两天后，她却收到了该院一线女医护的求助，同时得知金银潭有约1300名女性医护人员。
On February 9, she offered to donate to the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital. "We are in urgent need of professional protective equipment," she said. Two days later, she received help from the hospital's front-line medical staff.
另外一次是一位求助的医生回复她“卫生巾（需求）翻三倍吧，我们从来不发呢”。
Another time, a doctor who asked for help replied, "triple the sanitary napkin [requirement]. We never send it."
她无法理解为什么女性的需求会被如此漠视。
She could not understand why women's needs were so ignored.
“拜托你们看见女性劳动者吧！”梁钰在微博喊话，文字里透出愤怒。
"Please see the female workers!" Liang Yu in the micro-blog voice, the text of anger.
但采访时，梁钰语调平静地告诉我，大部分时候，她没有精力注意这些。
But the interview, Liang Yu tone quietly told me that most of the time, she did not pay attention to these.
一个为一线医护志愿做心理咨询的朋友对梁钰说，自己接到一位才刚入职就被派到前线的年轻女孩的咨询，本来应该开解女孩，但是咨询师自己听了也很崩溃。
Liang Yu, a friend who volunteers as a first-line medical consultant, said he had received a consultation from a young girl who had just been sent to the front line.
梁钰和朋友互相开解说：“对比一下，我们只是在家里敲键盘，我们也要努力一点，自己忍一忍，调整一下就过去了。
"Liang Yu and his friends explained to each other:" By contrast, we are just knocking on the keyboard at home, we should also try a little bit, endure it, adjust a little and then pass.
”不过，一天晚上， 没时间睡觉的梁钰实在压力太大，照着网上一个大学的心理咨询中心电话打过去，哭了一小时。
However, one night, Liang Yu, who had no time to sleep, was so stressed that he called a college counselor's office online and cried for an hour.
“（7号）就觉得已经不行了，真的没有怎么睡觉，信息是过载的，还要处理表格。
"(No.7) I think it's no use, really no sleep, the information is overloaded, and I have to deal with the form.
但我自己还没有理清情况，没有及时招人。
But I haven't sorted out the situation myself. I haven't recruited people in time.
”梁钰对我说。
'he said to me.
哭完，挂下电话，她觉得又可以继续战斗了。
After crying, she hung up the phone and felt ready to go on fighting again.
到2月10日，梁钰终于不堪重负，决定招募搭建志愿者团队。
By February 10, Liang Yu finally overburdened, decided to recruit and build a volunteer team.
。
.
2月11日，恒安集团通过“姐妹战疫安心行动”向湖北省汉川市人民医院捐赠女性用品。
On Feb. 11, Heng An Group donated women's articles to the Hanchuan People's Hospital in Hubei Province through Operation Sisters in Peace.
。
.
2月12日，梁钰个人捐赠60条安心裤、36条一次性内裤送达江汉方舱医院海南医疗队。
February 12, Liang Yu personal donation of 60 peace of mind pants, 36 disposable underwear to the Jiang Han cabin hospital Hainan medical team.
2小勇是“安心行动”最早的志愿者之一。
Xiao Yong was one of the first volunteers in "Operation Peace of mind."
2月7日下午，她刷到了梁钰呼吁关注孝感的微博时，当时，孝感已经成为武汉之外疫情最严重的城市。
Feb. 7 afternoon, she brushed Liang Yu to call attention to filial piety when the feeling of filial piety has become the worst outside Wuhan city.
尽管小勇人在东北，但是她想到有三个朋友在孝感，自己一直十分担忧他们，于是她给梁钰发去私信，表示自己可以帮忙协调孝感的运输，以及与医院沟通。
Although Xiaoyong people in the Northeast, but she thought of three friends in the sense of filial piety, she has been very worried about them, so she sent a private letter to Liang Yu, said that they can help coordinate filial piety transport, and communication with the hospital.
通过在孝感做公务员的师弟介绍，小勇进了一个由孝感各医院一线医护组成的微信群，询问、整理她们的需求，发给梁钰，由梁钰联络捐赠和物流。
Through filial piety as a civil servant's brother-in-law, Yong-Jin into a hospital by filial piety consisting of the front-line medical staff, to ask, sort out their needs, issued to Leung Yu, Liang Yu contact donations and logistics.
一两天里，她看着孝感下属各县级市的医护也陆续进来，群人数从三四十噌噌涨到了近一百。
For a day or two, she watched the arrival of medical care in the prefectural municipalities where she felt filial piety, and the number of people rose from the miso to nearly 100.
她一共整理统计了三次孝感女医护的物资需求，2月7日当天统计的第一批有发热门诊的8家定点医院里，在岗女性医护就有5900人，上报的需求是共29500条安心裤，平均每人只有5条，一天换两条，也不够用三天。
She has compiled statistics on the material needs of three women doctors and nurses. On February 7, there were 5,900 women in the first eight designated hospitals with fever clinics, with a reported need of 29,500 pairs of trousers, an average of five per person and two per day for less than three days.
“很多医院的人都不好意思要，有的医院有700多女性在岗医护，说‘捐500（条安心裤）就行’。
"A lot of people in hospitals are embarrassed," he said. "Some hospitals have more than 700 women on the job and say, 'Donate 500.
”小勇说。
"said little Yong.
2月10日，梁钰在微博发出招募志愿者的信息后，私信蜂拥而至，她说，她的微博上有上万条未读信息，只能“看缘分”点开，她也是模糊地意识到，要找有社工背景的、做媒体的、学统计的、搞管理的。
On February 10, Liang Yu, after Weibo issued a message to recruit volunteers, said she had tens of thousands of unread messages on her micro-blog, can only "see fate" point point, she is also vaguely aware of the need to find social work background, media, statistics, management.
当天，志愿者团队按照功能分成了找货组、募捐组、对接组、信息组、物流组、媒体组、宣传组。
On that day, the volunteer team was divided into three groups according to function: search group, fund-raising group, docking group, information group, logistics group, media group and propaganda group.
到2月14日，这个团队共有46位志愿者。
By February 14, the team had 46 volunteers.
正在读研的Doris因为疫情推迟开学，在2月10日这天刷到了梁钰的微博，觉得蛮有意义，就进了“安心行动”对接组。
Doris is reading the disease because of the delayed start of school, February 10 brush Liang Yu Weibo, feel quite meaningful, into the "peace of mind operations" docking group.
当夜，她的个人微信二维码同其他五名志愿者一起被放到了宣传组制作的募捐进度公示图中。
That night, her personal microphone two-dimensional code, along with five other volunteers, was posted on a fundraising progress chart produced by the advocacy group.
11日早上七点到晚上十点，Doris几乎没离开过书桌，对接媒体、个人和团体捐赠、医护求助、车队志愿者等超过100人，到睡觉时已是12日早上四点多了。
Doris barely left her desk between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. on the 11th and docked more than 100 people, including media, individual and group donations, medical help, motorcade volunteers, etc., and by bedtime it was past four o'clock on the 12th morning.
Doris之前有过做公益志愿者的经验，介绍她的工作职责时言简意赅，思路清晰。
Doris had previous experience as a volunteer, speaking briefly and thinking clearly about her job responsibilities.
她说，对接组的工作重点是询问、接收、核实湖北省各地市医院对女性健康用品的需求。
The focus of the docking group was to inquire about, receive and verify the demand for women's health supplies in hospitals across Hubei province, she said.
每天，Doris和近十位志愿者一起制作、更新一张详尽的表格（囊括了医院地址、医护数目、对接人信息、安心裤尺码等信息），经过核实，再与捐赠方的物资进行对接匹配。
Doris and nearly ten volunteers each day created and updated a detailed form (including hospital address, number of doctors, docking information, size of reassurance pants, etc.), which was verified and matched with the donor's material.
梁钰说，捐赠进行了几天之后，她们不再需要主动去征询、收集信息，到2月12日，通过微博私信或对接组微信联系团队求助的就有超过140家医院的医护。
After a few days of donation, they no longer need to actively seek and collect information. By February 12, more than 140 hospitals were in need of medical assistance through micro-blogging private letters or by contacting the group's messaging team.
Doris记得，两天里，光是华中科技大学同济医院就来求助过三次。
Doris remembers coming to Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology alone three times in two days.
信息组则负责与对接组、物流组、募捐组核实信息，录入表格，每晚再一起统计核算当日收到捐赠、与院方对接情况、善款使用情况等，交由宣传组制图。
Information group is responsible for the docking group, logistics group, fund-raising group to verify the information, enter the form, and every night another statistical accounting day received donations, docking with the hospital, use of charity, and so on, to the advocacy group mapping.
每天早上八点开始，9位志愿者实行轮班制，志愿者团队建立五天后，信息组录入了近200家医院的信息。
Nine volunteers worked in shifts from eight in the morning, and five days after the volunteer team was set up, the information group filled in information from nearly 200 hospitals.
志愿者小刘每天12点到16点负责整理、录入随时更新的医院需求、物资信息，同时配合提取其他组需要的数据，她不好意思地在电话里表示，这项工作不困难，只是自己和表格打交道不是很熟练，“可能会耽搁一点儿工作效率。
Volunteer Liu, who is responsible for sorting out and entering up-to-date information on hospital needs and materials from 12 to 16 every day, as well as retrieving data needed by other groups, said shyly on the phone that the work was not difficult, but that she was not proficient with her forms and "might delay working a bit."
”工作时，小刘常常一边录入信息，一边忍不住想，“怎么可能缺口这么大？怎么能让孕妇去前线？”她打开一张表格念给我听，“xx县人民医院50位孕妇，xx县人民医院81位孕妇。
At work, Xiao Liu often typed in information and couldn't help thinking, "How could there be such a big gap? How could a pregnant woman go to the front?" She opened a form and read it to me.
”2月12日起，她在医院报过来的需求中看到了安心包等孕妇用品，但在已对接的捐赠物品中，她发现针对孕妇的物资还是相对欠缺。
She saw supplies for pregnant women, such as packets, in hospital reporting requirements from Feb. 12, but among the donated items docked, she found that supplies for pregnant women were still relatively scarce.
“缺口大到超出想象。
"The gap is bigger than I thought.
”梁钰也几次感慨。
"Liang Yu also several times sigh.
2月9日，“安心行动”给武汉协和医院西院送了300箱、共28800条安心裤，到13日已全部用完，团队收到二次求助后，又派发了第二批7200条安心裤、24000条一次性内裤。
On February 9, Operation Peace of mind sent 300 boxes of comfort pants to the west courtyard of Wuhan Hsiao He Hospital. By February 13, all of them had been used up. After the team received the second call for help, it distributed a second batch of 7,200 slacks and 24,000 disposable underwear.
梁钰去问一线医生，医生说，第一批捐赠她们优先给了隔离病房的病人。
Liang asked first-line doctors who said they gave priority to patients in the isolation ward.
“好吧，我们只能再想办法凑，还能怎么办？”梁钰说。
"All right, we have to think of another way to scrape together, how can we do?" Liang Yu said.
2月11日晚，梁钰的团队与灵山基金会合作发起的公募在新浪微公益和为爱联合劝募两个平台上线，募捐额为2,265,055元。
On the night of Feb. 11, the public offering launched by Leung Yu's team in collaboration with the Lingshan Foundation went live on two platforms, Sina Micro-Public Welfare and Unite for Love, with a total fund-raising of $2,265,055.
有人质疑说，公募额为什么这么大？梁钰在微博列出了武汉几大著名医院和孝感市各医院女性医护的人数：“整个孝感市，女性医护人员，约1.66万武汉同济，女性医护人员，远超5000武汉协和总院，女性医护人员，约5700武汉金银潭，女性医护人员，约1300武汉汉口医院，女性医护人员，约600同济医院中法院院区，女性医护人员，约1000…… ……”上述仅孝感和武汉两个城市的部分医院就有超过3万名女性医护，保守估算每人每月使用两条安心裤，按照采购合作方全棉时代一包（两条）安心裤6.94元的价格，要花费20.95万元。
"The entire city of Xiaoyan, female medical personnel, about 16,600, Wuhan Concorde General Hospital, female medical staff, about 5,700 Wuhan gold and silver pool, female medical personnel, about 1,300 Wuhan Hankou Hospital, female medical personnel, about 1,600 Wuhan Hankou Hospital, female medical personnel, about 600 Tongzi Hospital Court District, female medical personnel, around 600 Tongzi Hospital, the cost of women medical personnel.
而还有大量的需求来自10家方舱医院、雷神山、火神山，以及湖北其他12个地市自治州的医院。
There is also a large number of needs from 10 cabin hospitals, Lei Shenshan, Hubei Province, as well as 12 other city hospitals.
在这些医院里，梁钰觉得，最艰难的还是方舱。
In these hospitals, Liang Yu felt that the most difficult or square cabin.
方舱医院是临时建立，医护人员来自各家医院，很多甚至来自外省，她们从接到调动通知到出发间隔时间很短，到了方舱医院之后，也不可能出来购买卫生巾或安心裤。
The hospital was set up on an ad hoc basis, staffed by staff from various hospitals, many of them even from the provinces, who had little time between the notification of transfer and departure and were unlikely to come out to buy sanitary towels or safety trousers after arriving at the cabin hospital.
而且，方舱不是独立行政机构，没有统一的官方可以进行捐赠对接。
Moreover, the capsule is not an independent administrative agency and there is no unified official authority for donation and docking.
“我们这边统计，有的方舱说不需要（安心裤）……好多医疗队进驻，比如说协和知道自己（的支援队）需要这些，但是不知道整个方舱需要多少。
"On our side, some of the cabins said they didn't need [comfort pants]... a lot of medical teams came in, like Concorde knew it was needed, but didn't know how much it would take.
”Doris说。
"said Doris.
对于“安心行动”来说，这仍然是一个难以解决的问题。
For Operation Reliance, this remains a difficult problem to resolve.
3在对接组统计需求的时候，找货组也已经开始联系物资。
In the docking group statistical requirements, the search group has also begun to contact the material.
2月7日开始，陆续有捐赠方找到梁钰。
Starting on 7 February, a succession of donors to find Liang Yu.
高洁丝、全棉时代、ABC、洁婷、恒安集团等品牌方都通过“安心行动”捐赠了安心裤或卫生巾。
Gao Jie silk, all cotton era, ABC, Jing, Heng An Group and other brands through "peace of mind operations" donated comfort pants or sanitary napkin.
“我相当于一个开源，”梁钰说，通常是她先和品牌方谈，再分派给找货组对接。
"I am the equivalent of an open source," said Liang Yu, who usually talks to the brand first and then assigns it to the cargo team.
有部分商家提出要求，希望被捐赠方用指定手机型号、在指定角度拍视频，视频里必须拉横幅、喊很长的口号。
Some businesses are asking if they want the recipient to use a specific phone model and shoot videos at a given angle, with banners and long slogans.
“这直接把受捐方惹毛了。
"It makes the recipient very angry.
我们也觉得很过分，与其这样，就不合作了。
We think it's going too far, and we're not cooperating with it.
”她在接受凤凰网公益频道采访时表示。
"she said in an interview on the Order of the Phoenix channel.
很多热心人也有捐赠的想法。
Many enthusiastic people also have the idea of donating.
他们之中，有的希望通过“安心行动”捐赠，有的希望亲自捐赠。
Some of them hope to donate through Operation Secure Tenure, while others want to donate in person.
2月11日，Doris的大部分时间都花在了和大约30位个人捐赠者的对接上，“有的人就想问你一个医院的地址，但是给了你这个地址我们就要负责任，需要监督各个环节：物资的质量、物流的问题、到没到医院。
Doris spent most of the February 11 meeting with about 30 individual donors. "Some people want to ask you the address of a hospital, but we are responsible for giving you that address, and we need to monitor everything from the quality of the material, logistics to the hospital.
”一天下来，Doris总结了她遇到的“经典桥段”：有人过来要了医院地址，没一会儿来反馈说，这个网店不给“三证”，那个网店不发货了，再折腾半天，发现顺丰也停了。
Doris concluded the day with a summary of the "classic bridge" she encountered: someone came over to ask for the hospital's address, and presently reported that the store would not give "three cards" and that the store would not deliver the goods.
捐赠者一次次地问她：怎么办？她也没办法。
The donor asked her again and again, What? She couldn't help it.
个人捐赠小额物资很不容易实施。
It is difficult for individuals to donate small amounts of material.
“比如说我这儿有一堆卫生巾，我觉得它是安全的，但是要转到第二、三方，就需要一个证明，这个证明拿不出来怎么办？这就需要我们用比较好的话术表达，既不会伤及到大家的爱心，又能比较高效地完成事情。
"I have a pile of sanitary napkins, for example, and I think it's safe, but to get to the second and third party, you need a certificate that doesn't come out.
”Doris说。
"said Doris.
2月12日下午，确认顺丰和中国邮政都不运输非医疗物资后，团队关闭了个人捐赠物资的通道。
On the afternoon of February 12, after confirming that neither Shunfeng nor China Post would transport non-medical supplies, the team closed the way for individuals to donate supplies.
随着“安心行动”影响力扩大，一线医护传递的需求猛增，品牌方的主动捐助已经不够了，找货组承受的压力也随之加大。
The pressure on search teams has increased as the impact of Operation Reliance has expanded and the demand for front-line care delivery has surged, with insufficient voluntary contributions from brands.
志愿者阿布今年30岁，有数年互联网行业工作经验，他主动提出担任找货组负责人，“想多承担一点。
Abul, a 30-year-old volunteer with several years of experience in the Internet industry, offered to be head of the search group.
”他说。
'he said.
他很热心，进团队一天后，就和梁钰聊自己对于“安心行动”优化组织分工的建议。
He is very warm-hearted, after a day into the team, Liang Yuhua and his "peace of mind" to optimize the division of labor recommendations.
采访结束后，他也把关于“安心行动”的其他报道发给我，“信息作参考。
At the end of the interview, he sent me other stories about "Operation Peace of mind," "Information for reference.
”他简要说明。
He gave a brief account.
2月10日以来，找货组的三位志愿者共交涉了约20家厂商，愿意捐赠的就交由对接组对接资源，想提供采购的就继续聊。
Since 10 February, three volunteers from the Cargo Working Group have approached some 20 vendors and those willing to donate have been handed over to the docking team for docking resources, and those who wish to provide procurement continue to talk.
阿布总结，第一个难点是确定可供货的厂家，摸清品类；其次是和对方沟通，尽量把价格谈低点儿，“当然我们不会特别纠结，一般其实一块多或者几毛一条，很便宜了，谈了其实也就是压一两分而已”；再次，就是和其他组一同协调匹配厂商、捐赠方、院方的需求。
In the second place, we can communicate with each other and try to keep the price as low as possible.Of course, we don't have a lot of difficulties.
阿布从前在武汉读书时参与过环保机构的公益活动，之前就关注了梁钰的微博。
Abu was once involved in the public welfare activities of environmental protection organizations while studying in Wuhan, before paying attention to the Weibo Liang Yu.
他的嫂子是护士，看到梁钰谈到一线女性医护缺乏健康物品时，阿布深感赞同，“我自己不是什么主义者，但我会以比较平常的状态去关注，护士绝大多数是女性，她们日常需要的（健康用品）显然是非常非常多的。
"I am not a fundamentalist myself, but I will look at it in a more normal way. Nurses are overwhelmingly female and their daily needs are clearly very, very large.
但凡对这个事儿有正确认识的人都会重视，说大点儿这是作为现代公民的一个基础常识。
But anyone who has the right knowledge of the matter will take it seriously, saying that it is a basic common sense of modern citizenship.
”阿布说。
"said Abu.
4除了缺货，最大的问题就是缺钱。
Apart from the shortage of goods, the biggest problem is lack of money.
“需求量太大了， 湖北企业现在开工的话要付3倍工资，其实对他们也是挺大的负担，直接让他们提供那么多是不现实的。
"Hubei enterprises have to pay three times their wages if they start work, which is quite a burden for them. It is unrealistic to ask them to provide so much directly.
”小勇说。
"said little Yong.
对接了孝感医护人员的需求之后，她成为募捐组的负责人。
After docking the filial needs of the medical staff, she became the head of the fund-raising group.
募捐不是件容易的事。
It is not easy to collect money.
2月7日，梁钰和几个朋友有了发起募捐的想法，她们咨询了有饭圈应援经验的粉丝，发现那套募捐规则只适用于后援会和粉丝站，根据《慈善法》，她们要挂靠有公募资质的基金会才能获得合法性。
On February 7, Leung and a few friends came up with the idea of launching a fund-raising campaign. They consulted fans who had experience with rice rings and found that the solicitation rules only applied to aid committees and fan stations.
怎么才能找到基金会呢？梁钰问了很多人。
How can I find the foundation? Liang Yu asked many people.
2月9日，梁钰问到小勇：能搞到钱吗？小勇想了想回：可以。
February 9, Liang Yu asked Xiaoyong: Can we get money? Xiaoyong thought back: Yes.
她在硕士师门群里发出求基金会资源的信息，所有人都被动员起来。
She sends messages about the resources of the foundation in her master's class, and everyone is mobilized.
最后她成功对接三家机构，从中选择了灵山基金会作为合作方。
Finally, she successfully docked three institutions, from which she selected the Lingshan Foundation as a partner.
“大的基金会审批流程都会有一点慢，他们也有一些风险上的担心，我们选择的标准就是要最快。
"The big foundation approval process is going to be a little bit slow, they have some risk concerns, and we choose the quickest criteria."
”灵山基金会是一个研究慈善法的校友帮忙对接的，这位校友还帮他们详细论证了“安心行动”发起、执行公募的合法性。
The Lingshan Foundation helped dock with an alumnus who studied philanthropy and helped them to document the legality of the launch and execution of Operation Safe.
这时距梁钰问她“搞钱”还没过去24小时。
At this time, Yu asked her "make money" has not been 24 hours.
2月10日夜里，刚建立不久的募捐组五人开始赶立项书。
On the night of February 10, the newly established group of five began to rush through the project.
小勇是社工专业出身，其他组员分别有财会、新闻、公益机构背景，但都是第一次写公募项目立项书。
Xiao Yong is a professional social worker, the other members of the group have accounting, news, public welfare institutions, but it is the first time to write a public offering project.
小勇以每半小时为节点给组员更新任务，大家一点点核算预算覆盖人数，谨慎措辞，避免风险。
Xiaoyong every half an hour for the node to update the task, everyone a little bit of budget coverage, careful wording, to avoid risk.
11日中午，立项书完成，小勇又和基金会敲定捐赠上线的流程细节，一边和组员沟通接受个人、团体捐款的工作流程。
11 noon, the project finished, Xiaoyong and the Foundation to finalize the details of the donation process, while communicating with team members to accept individual, group contributions workflow.
2月11日白天，灵山基金会审批立项通过，当日19点52分，公募链接通过新浪微公益和为爱联合劝募两个平台上线。
By day, Feb. 11, the Lingshan Foundation approved the approval of the project, the same day at 19: 52, the public-offering link through Sina micro-public welfare and the joint solicitation of two platforms for love.
这时，“安心行动”已和全棉时代谈下了合作，她们的第一批公募所得捐款将全部用于采购全棉时代的安心裤。
By this time, Operation Peace of Mind had entered into a partnership with the Cotton Age, and their first public offerings would be entirely for cotton-era slacks.
小勇担心这么大的募捐额无法完成，但是灵山基金会的工作人员安慰她，募不到就进度慢一些，和全棉时代分批签限量采购协议就好。
Xiaoyong worried that such a large fund-raising amount could not be completed, but Lingshan Foundation staff comforted her, not to raise a slower pace, and cotton-era batch signed limited purchase agreement.
2月11日晚，小勇又和微公益的工作人员对接，后者给“安心行动”爱心募捐提供了流量曝光。
On the night of Feb. 11, Xiao Yong docked with a microcommonweal worker, who exposed the flow of the charity fund-raising for Operation Safe.
出乎所有人的意料，募捐的速度很快。
To everyone's surprise, the fund-raising was very fast.
一个晚上过去，到2月12日早上9:12，实际捐款已达到2,355,051.96元，超出了募捐额度。
One evening, by 9: 12 a.m. on 12 February, actual contributions had reached 2,355,051.96 yuan, which was more than the amount raised.
募捐通道关闭后，募捐组和找货组又开始推进和全棉时代的采购合同。
After the fundraiser closed, the collection group and the search group began to push ahead with the cotton era procurement contract.
13日下午，“安心行动”已完成了第一批公募采购，花费2,031,485元购入20万条安心裤、300,926条一次性内裤。
On the afternoon of the 13th, Operation Ease completed its first public offering and bought 200,000 slacks and 300,926 disposable underwear for 2,031,485 yuan.
次日的公示表明：善款余额中10万元为运输预算，5万元为应急预算，剩余173,566.96元将全部用于采购物资。
The following day's announcement indicated that $100,000 of the balance of the donation was for the transport budget, $50,000 was for the contingency budget and the remaining $173,566.96 would be fully utilized for the procurement of materials.
到2月13日，小勇才真正放下心。
Only on February 13 did Xiaoyong really relax.
过去几天工作强度太大，回忆一些时间点时她常常沉默片刻，带着歉意感慨，“哇，我的天，等会儿我看看，怎么这个也忘了。
The past few days have been too intense, and she's often silent for a moment as she remembers some points, apologetic, "Wow, my God, I'll see later, but this one's forgotten, too.
”采访后的工作间隙，她又发来微信，“梁钰让我找钱的时候我告诉她，放心……实际上我内心是很忐忑很怀疑的。
"After the interview, she sent a message," Liang Yu let me look for money when I told her, rest assured... in fact my heart is very perturbed very suspicious.
”“我忐忑了特别久，就怕别人不重视。
"" I perturbed so long that I was afraid others would not take it seriously.
募捐的时候也在害怕，募不到怎么办。
Fundraiser is also in fear, can not raise how to do.
”“原来我真能做到。
"" I can do it.
”在疫情来临之前，小勇辞了职打算考博，结果由于疫情，不能考试也不能找工作，每天刷微博疫情信息，焦虑异常，感觉都有点替代性心理创伤了。
"Before the outbreak hit, Xiao Yong quit his job in preparation for Cobo. As a result, he was unable to take the exam or find a job because of the epidemic, brushing information about the microblogging epidemic every day, suffering from anxiety and feeling a bit of a surrogate trauma.
“做这个项目，也是实现了对自己的治愈吧。
"To do this project is to achieve their own cure.
”公募下线后，募捐组负责继续对接企业和团体的捐赠。
After the launch, the fund-raising group continued to channel donations from businesses and groups.
小勇和组员们在试图简化物品捐赠的流程，也在整理风控条例，列清需要规避的法律风险。
Xiaoyong and his team are trying to simplify the process of donation of goods, and are also collating wind-control regulations to identify legal risks that need to be circumvented.
“每个工作者都要在疫情中参与进来，发挥自己的能力，才能真实地抚平自己的创伤。
"Every worker needs to be involved in the epidemic and use their abilities to truly heal their wounds.
”小勇说。
"said little Yong.
5“安心行动”的每一个环节都不容易，但是自始至终，最难解决的就是物流。
5. "Safe Action" each link is not easy, but from beginning to end, the most difficult solution is logistics.
自1月23日武汉和湖北其他地市陆续封城后，航运停了，陆运受到严格管控；没有疾控指挥部授予的通行证，私家车和普通大型车不能出武汉本市，外省的物资也无法运进湖北——而女性健康用品并未被归为可以得到特殊待遇的医用物资。
Since the closure of Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province on January 23, shipping has stopped and land transportation has been strictly controlled; private cars and ordinary large cars cannot leave Wuhan without a permit from the CDC, and supplies from the provinces cannot be transported to Hubei - and women's health supplies are not classified as medical supplies deserving special treatment.
2月10日，谢女士在微博热门里看到了梁钰的倡议。
On February 10, Ms. Xie saw Liang Yu's initiative in the micro-blog hot spots.
她今年48岁，是某省航空物流公司负责人，正好因为小区封闭休假在家，加入志愿者团队后成为物流组负责人。
She is 48 years old, is the head of an aviation logistics company in a province, just because the area closed leave at home, joined a volunteer team and became the head of the logistics group.
物流组一共13人，在对接组将物资与医院信息匹配、信息组录入信息后，开始组织运输工作。
Logistics group of 13 people, in the docking group material and hospital information matching, information group input information, began to organize transport work.
其中有三四个成员将信息转化成派单，跟踪物流状况，其他组员则来自物流协会和武汉当地的志愿者车队。
Three or four of them converted the information into dispatches to track logistics status, while others came from the logistics association and local Wuhan volunteer teams.
2月11日，15家粉丝应援站组成的“666联盟”通过武汉武商超市采购了666箱安心裤捐给同济医院，武商无法运输。
On February 11, the 666 alliance of 15 fans' aid stations donated 666 boxes of comfort pants to Tongji Hospital through Wuhan Wuchang Supermarket.
谢女士通过上海中通的老总，联系上了湖北省中通的一位陈经理，后者在谢女士将“666联盟”物资信息发出后一小时，就派人到货源地拉上了货；并爽快答应，全程为“安心行动”在湖北省内免费提供运力。
Ms. Xie contacted a manager of Zhongtong in Hubei Province through her boss, who sent a delivery to the source one hour after Ms. Xie sent the "666 Alliance" material information, and readily agreed to provide free transportation capacity for Operation Safe in Hubei Province.
在疫区捐赠中，物流一直是最困难的环节之一。
Logistics is always one of the most difficult links in the donation of epidemic area.
但谢女士和我通话时语气一直蛮淡定，“我们遇到问题就解决问题，”她语速较缓，态度从容。
But Ms. Xie and I talked in a calm tone. "We solve problems when we have problems," she said slowly and calmly.
“现在武汉市区内的运输我个人还是有信心的。
"Now Wuhan city area transportation I still have the confidence personally.
”谢女士说。
'she said.
她和组员测算过，一辆私家车可以装约20件安心裤，于是组内商定，100件以上的物资由中通车队支援，100件以下的小额捐赠由志愿者出车，物流组派单后，由志愿者车队负责人到车队群里匹配车辆。
She and her team calculated that a private car could hold about 20 pairs of trousers, so it was agreed in the group that more than 100 items would be supported by a Chinese caravan, that small donations of less than 100 items would be sent by volunteers, and that the head of the logistics team would go to the convoy to match the vehicles.
谢女士担心100件的量对于私家车太大，但车队负责人保证说，没问题，“一趟跑不完跑两趟，两趟跑不完跑三趟。
Ms Xie worries that the 100 pieces are too big for a private car, but the motorcade leader promised, "No problem, two trips for two runs, three runs for two runs."
”谢女士安排了一个组员专门负责追踪发往武汉市以外的派件，在物资派发前，这位组员要和当地医院、疾控中心联系，掌握当日的交通信息。
Ms Xie assigned a team to track shipments sent outside Wuhan, and the team contacted local hospitals and the CDC to get traffic information for the day before the supplies were distributed.
谢女士给我展示了一张表格，是物流组整理的湖北各市防疫中心/防控指挥部交通组的联系方式。
Ms. Xie showed me a form, which is the contact information of Hubei city epidemic prevention center / control and control command.
12日晚接受采访前，谢女士收到反馈，武汉送到黄冈某医院的一单货在没有通行证的情况下，全程畅通无阻，“但物流信息是每天都在变，你知道吧？没有人知道这个事明天会咋样。
Before the interview on Tuesday night, Ms. Xie received feedback that a single item sent by Wuhan to a hospital in Huanggang was flowing unimpeded without a laissez-passer. "But logistics information changes every day, you know? No one knows what will happen tomorrow.
异地运输可能情况会比你想象得要复杂得多。
Relocation could be a lot more complicated than you think.
”2月11、12日两天，物流组帮助完成了数批厂商和公益组织捐赠物资的运输。
On February 11 and 12, the logistics team helped complete shipments of donated goods from manufacturers and public benefit groups.
第一批公募结束后，物流组的工作强度才迎来高峰。
It was only after the first public offerings that the intensity of the work of the Logistics Group peaked.
2月13日晚，通过中通，“安心行动”运了250箱安心裤到协和西院。
On the night of Feb. 13, "Operation Peace of mind" delivered 250 boxes of comfort pants to the Western Concorde courtyard.
14日，3万多片安心裤抵达协和总院。
On the 14th, more than 30,000 pieces of comfort pants arrived at Concorde House.
第一批全棉时代的物资还将运往黄梅县人民医院、黄冈市妇幼保健院、浠水县中医院。
It is indicated that the first batch of cotton-age material would also be transported to these hospital.
2月12日晚，谢女士曾通过个人关系与顺丰商议合作，但没有成功。
On the evening of 12 February, Ms. Xie had discussed and cooperated with Shun Fung through personal contacts, but without success.
“中通的力量政府也在征用，不确定能剩余多少力量给我们，所以现在也蛮麻烦的。
"China Tong's power government is also in requisition, not sure how much power can be left to us, so it is rather troublesome now.
”谢女士补充，安心裤、卫生巾体积比同等重量的货物要大30%-40%，很考验运力。
Ms Xie added that safety pants and sanitary napkins are 30% to 40% bigger than goods of the same weight, testing capacity.
她也让朋友帮忙找其他物流公司，但其他公司不像中通是全国直营，执行力没那么强。
She also asked friends to help find other logistics companies, but other companies are not as strong as China Central Incorporated, which has less enforcement power.
另一个难题是，湖北省内的安心裤、卫生巾库存有限。
Another problem is that the Hubei province in the comfort pants, sanitary napkin inventory is limited.
阿布介绍说，他联络的大部分货源都来自福建、江西、北京、重庆等地。
Abu said most of the sources he contacted came from Fujian, Jiangxi, Beijing and Chongqing.
因此谢女士预估，物流组未来工作最大的挑战还是尤其省外货源的运输。
Therefore, Ms. Xie estimated that the logistics group in the future work of the biggest challenges or particularly the transport of goods.
厂家自行运输，需要搞到通行证，还要找到愿意送物资到武汉、返程后自行隔离14天的司机，难度很大。
Manufacturers transport their own, need to get a pass, but also to find supplies to Wuhan, after the return of the 14-day isolation of their own, very difficult.
中通承诺，可以为她们派车到省际高速收费站对接省外货源，解决外省车辆无法入鄂的问题。
The company promised to send them vehicles to interprovincial high-speed toll stations to dock outside the province, to solve the problem of vehicles in the provinces.
不过这样一来，卸货、装货的过程会带来繁重的工作量。
In this way, however, the process of unloading and loading can lead to a heavy workload.
“很麻烦。
"It's troublesome.
”谢女士说，“所以我们还没（这么）操作，但是我估计后期可能得用这种方式来对接了。
"So we haven't done it yet, but I think we'll have to do it in this way later on," she said.
”。
"
2月15日，“姐妹战疫安心行动”将85箱共6120条安心裤送达武汉市中心医院后湖院区。
Feb. 15, "Operation Sisters in Peace" delivered 85 boxes of 6120 comfort pants to the backlake courtyard of Wuhan Central Hospital.
。
.
2月15日，“姐妹战疫安心行动”将170箱共12240条安心裤送达武汉市第一医院。
On Feb. 15, Operation Sisters Against the Sisters of War sent 170 boxes of 12,240 comfort pants to Wuhan First Hospital.
6截至2月15日24点，梁钰和她的志愿者团队共计协调9个品牌、3个团体、10人次个人捐赠，捐赠安心裤186,840条、卫生巾2880片、一次性内裤3156条、护手霜700支，配送至武汉、黄冈、孝感、鄂州等地共35家医院。
As of 2400 on February 15, Liang Yu and her volunteer team had coordinated 9 brands, 3 groups, 10 individual donations, 186,840 donating comfort pants, 2,880 sanitary napkins, 3,156 disposable underwear, 700 hand cream, and distributed to 35 hospitals in Wuhan, Huanggang, Xiaogan and Huizhou.
尽管有这么大的量，但是梁钰告诉我，“安心行动”目前收到的捐赠物资加上第一批公募所得能购买的物资总量，只能满足目前收到的一线医护需求的约十分之一。
Despite this amount, Liang Yu told me that the donation received by Operation Ease, together with the total amount of materials that can be purchased with the first batch of proceeds, can only meet about one-tenth of the first-line care needs currently received.
她呼吁说，民间力量有限，女性健康用品应被列入相关部门统一采购的疫区物资。
She called for limited civilian power, and that female health supplies should be included in the unified procurement of affected areas by the relevant departments.
2月14日，全国妇联所属的中国妇女发展基金会宣布，紧急募集款项，向一线女性医务人员支援安心裤、卫生巾等女性用品。
On February 14, the China Women's Development Foundation, affiliated with the All-China Women's Federation, announced an emergency fund-raising campaign to support female medical personnel in such areas as slacks and sanitary napkins.
浙江妇联也发起了关爱一线女性医务工作者的公益行动。
Zhejiang Women's Union has also launched a pro bono initiative to care for front-line women medical workers.
“安心行动”也和其他几个为一线女性医护募捐健康用品的志愿者组织达成了共识，共享医院与物资名单，“比如我们这里物资不够的时候，也会分享给其他的组织，看他们能不能帮忙捐赠。
Safe Action also reached an agreement with several other volunteer organizations that raise health supplies for front-line women to share hospital and material lists. "When we don't have enough, for example, we share it with other organizations to see if they can help donate
”梁钰希望“安心行动”能获得更大的影响力，从而可以更高效地帮助更多的一线女性医护。
"Liang Yu hopes that Operation Safe will gain more influence so that more frontline women can be reached more efficiently.
但与此同时，梁钰也担心影响力扩大可能带来的风险。
But at the same time, Liang Yu also worried about the potential risks of increased influence.
尽管她向研究法律的朋友求证过“安心行动”的合法性，可是一直无法安心。
She has been unable to reassure her legal friends about the legality of Operation Safe.
“我们内心当然是希望做下去的，但我们如果想做下去，肯定是需要主流声音的支持，那我们可能就更有动力和能力去做这个事情。
"We want to do it, of course, but if we want to do it, we definitely need the support of mainstream voices, and we may be more motivated and able to do it.
如果主流不接受我们，我们可能就会结束。
If the mainstream does not accept us, we may end up.
我们还是需要走一步看一步。
We still need to take a step at a time.
”梁钰说。
'said Mr. Leung.
2月13日晚，梁钰在她的微博上呼吁：“这一次的疫情女性医护人员充分体现了我国职业女性的高素养，完全不存在刻版印象中的体力不够，无法吃苦，无法出差，无法加班，矫情。
On the night of February 13, Liang Yu, in her micro-blog, called: "This time the epidemic of female health-care workers fully reflect the high quality of China's professional women, there is no engraved impression of the physical strength, unable to suffer, unable to travel, unable to work overtime, artificial.
大过年从全国各地支援武汉的是她们，穿上防护服不吃不喝几小时月经期没有足够卫生用品也笑笑说没事的是她们……希望在疫情时，能够给予她们应得的保障；希望疫情结束后，她们平安回来时，她们能够得到应有的真金白银升职加薪，拥有更广阔的职业天地，她们值得；也希望此次女战士们已经足够证明了女性职业者的素养，请接下来高校以及单位招生招聘时，以同样录取标准对待每一个人。
They wear protective clothing, do not drink a few hours menstrual period is not enough hygiene items and laugh that it is okay they are... hope that when the epidemic is over, they will be able to get the proper promotion and salary, have a wider career, hope that the women soldiers have proved the quality of female professionals, then universities and recruitment, the same admission criteria.
”2月14日夜里，一位方舱医院的医护感谢她：“起码现在有你们的号召，没有人再顶着带血的防护服走了。
"On the night of February 14, a cabin hospital doctor thanked her:" At least now there's a call from you, and no one's wearing a blood suit anymore.
”7从2月7日到现在，所有参与“安心行动”的人都在超负荷工作。
"7 From February 7 to the present, all those involved in Operation Relieve have been working beyond their capacity.
媒体组负责人Sappho告诉我，进群几天，大家没有自我介绍、互相都不知道身份，直接开启朝十朝二模式，偶尔互相打气，没有聊过闲天。
'For a few days we didn't introduce ourselves, we didn't know who we were, 'said Sappho, head of the media group.
“过得没日没夜的，啥也不知道了。
'Day and night, and know nothing.
”小勇形容，飙出了东北口音。
"said Xiaoyong, with a Northeast accent.
在采访中，梁钰说：“我们的工作是做不完的，大家每天都到非常晚，我们觉得这样下去不行。
In the interview, Liang Yu said: "Our work is endless, everyone is very late every day, we feel this is not going to go on.
”高密度的工作状态下，阿布感觉四天像是过了一个月。
In high-density work, Abu feels like four days is a month.
2月13日的晚间会议上，梁钰她们谈到了轮班的计划，“考虑到未来持久性的问题，希望很多人复工以后能以半兼职的状态让团队运转起来。
At the evening meeting on February 13, they talked about the plan of shift work. "Considering the problem of permanence in the future, I hope that many people will return to work part-time to make the team work.
”“大多数人都比较年轻，其实应对这种突发和大规模信息集中处理的经验是比较少的。
"Most people are younger, and there's relatively little experience in dealing with this sort of sudden and massive centralization of information.
”2月14晚，梁钰在个人微博又发布了志愿者团队招新信息，为对接组、信息组、媒体组扩充人手。
"On the evening of February 14, Liang Yu posted a new team of volunteers to recruit new information for the docking group, the information group and the media group.
支持梁钰走下去的，是医护人员的付出，也是女性之间互相守望与支持的情谊。
Support Liang Yu to go down, is the pay of medical staff, but also between women watchful and supportive friendship.
2月15日，她在微博上讲了志愿者笛子的故事。
On February 15, she told the story of the volunteer flute on Weibo.
笛子就是那个翻墙出去给海南医疗队找安心裤的武汉女孩。
The flute is the Wuhan girl who went over the wall to find comfort pants for Hainan medical team.
梁钰形容说，“她很生猛”。
"She is very fierce," Liang Yu said.
她们在对话中，互称对方“姐妹”。
In conversation, they call each other "sisters."
当笛子跑了50公里给上海华山医院医疗队送了物资之后，梁钰说，姐妹，你太不容易了，我们上海人民感谢你。
When the flute ran 50 kilometers to send supplies to the Shanghai Huashan Hospital Medical Team, Liang Yu said, "Sisters, you are too difficult, we Shanghai people thank you.
梁钰又说，你爸妈同意你乱跑啊，50公里啊姐妹，都可以从上海去苏州了！笛子说，嘿，姐妹，我可是我妈带着我一起送的。
"Your parents agreed to run around, 50 kilometers, sister, can all go from Shanghai to Suzhou," said the flute, "Hey, sister, I was sent by my mother with me.
梁钰说：“我总教育她，姐妹，你这个保护工作要做好阿，不要搞这么危险，你这样可不行，你不能这样做一个抱薪者阿，不要这么疯！”笛子却说：“我们就是普通人，时光荏苒，从不曾离开，就像每一个今天，守护这座城。
You can't do this, you can't do this! You can't do this, you can't be so crazy! "The flute said," We are ordinary people, time flies, never leave, just like every one today, guard this city.
”最后，梁钰写道：“其实我们这些人，彼此之间谁也不认识，谁又不是叫了声姐妹，彼此守护着彼此，守护着这个国家呢。
"In fact, we people do not know each other, who are not called sisters, guard each other, guard the country?
