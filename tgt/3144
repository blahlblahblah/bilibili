在新冠肺炎蔓延全球的情况下，继“钻石公主”号后，又一艘邮轮牵动全球目光。
In the case of the spread of pneumonia in the world, following the "Princess Diamond", another cruise ship to the world's attention.
当地时间3月9日，载有54个国家和地区共3500多人的“至尊公主”号邮轮，停靠在美国加州奥克兰港。
The Supreme Princess, with more than 3,500 people from 54 countries and territories, docked in Auckland, Calif., on March 9, local time.
乘客拟开始下船，可能持续2到3天时间。
Passengers are expected to start disembarking, which may last between two and three days.
截至目前，邮轮上已有21人感染新冠肺炎病毒，其中19人为船员。
So far, 21 people have been infected with the virus, 19 of whom are crew members.
另有乘坐过该邮轮的5人在下船后确诊，1人死亡。
Another five people aboard the vessel were diagnosed after disembarkation and one died.
这艘邮轮是否会重现“钻石公主”号的噩梦？乘客和船员又将得到怎样的安置？美国政府做好应对准备了吗？又一艘噩梦邮轮“至尊公主”号发生了什么？“至尊公主”号邮轮与此前疫情严重的“钻石公主”号同属一家公司，均由嘉年华邮轮公司旗下的公主邮轮公司运营。
Will the ship recreate the nightmare of the Princess Diamond? What will happen to passengers and crew? Is the US government ready to deal with it? What happens to another nightmare liner, the Princess Supreme? The Princess of the Supreme Princess is part of the same company as the previously devastating Princess Diamond, operated by the Princess Cruise Company of Carnival Cruises.
“至尊公主”号于1998年首航，并于2004年进行了翻新，可容纳2600名乘客和1150名船员。
Launched in 1998, it was refurbished in 2004 to accommodate 2,600 passengers and 1,150 crew members.
虽然“至尊公主”号总人数不及“钻石公主”多，但死亡病例曾乘坐的事实，让事态变得更加严峻，而其面临的处境，很有可能会比后者更危险！3月4日，一则“噩耗”让邮轮上乘客的美梦戛然而止——加州确认该州出现首例死亡病例，而这名患者生前曾于2月10日，乘坐“至尊公主”号从旧金山出发前往墨西哥，2月21日返回旧金山。
Although the total number of Princess Supreme is less than the number of Princess Diamond, the fact that the deaths occurred has made matters worse and the situation is likely to be even more perilous - California confirmed its first case of death on Feb. 10 from San Francisco for Mexico on February 21 and San Francisco on February 21.
他被怀疑在船上感染了病毒。
He was suspected of contracting the virus on the ship.
不仅如此，3月6日，康特拉科斯塔县官员确认3例确诊病例，其中2人曾经登上“至尊公主”号。
Not only that, but on March 6, Contra Costa County officials confirmed three confirmed cases, two of them aboard the Supreme Princess.
目前，已有5位此前搭乘过“至尊公主”号的乘客被确认感染。
Five passengers who had previously been aboard the Super Princess were confirmed to be infected.
虽然在参加过墨西哥之行的旅客中，接近2500人已经下船，但令人担心的是，另外62人继续参加了前往夏威夷的行程，并有2000多名乘客新加入旅程。
While nearly 2,500 of those who took part in the trip to Mexico have disembarked, there are concerns that 62 others have continued on their way to Hawaii and that more than 2,000 passengers have joined the trip.
在得知消息后，邮轮取消停靠墨西哥，直接驶回旧金山，5日进到外海。
After learning of the news, the ship canceled call Mexico, straight back to San Francisco, 5 into the sea.
6日，美国副总统彭斯宣布，对46名邮轮乘客和员工的病毒测试结果显示，21人的检测结果呈阳性。
Vice President Burns said Monday that 21 people tested positive for the virus in 46 cruise passengers and employees.
当地时间3月9日，“至尊公主”号邮轮结束数日的海上漂流，停靠在美国加州奥克兰港22号码头区域。
On March 9, 2006, the USS Princess Supreme was adrift at Pier 22 in Oakland, Calif., after several days at sea.
根据加州紧急事务办公室的通知，乘客拟于当地时间9日开始下船，可能持续2到3天时间。
According to the California Office of Emergency Services, passengers are scheduled to disembark at 9: 00 local time, possibly lasting two to three days.
邮轮成“豪华监狱”乘客：看新闻才知邮轮疫情更“魔幻”的是，船上的乘客对疫情一无所知，他们还是通过新闻，才得知有关邮轮的消息。
Passengers in "luxury prisons": It's the news that makes cruise ships even more magical. Passengers on board don't know anything about the epidemic, and it is through the news that they learn about the cruise ship.
乘客德比•洛夫特斯说，她通过观看微软全国广播公司(MSNBC)的新闻得知，21名乘客和工作人员被感染。
Passenger Debbie Lovters said she learned from watching news on Microsoft's National Broadcasting Corporation that 21 passengers and staff had been infected.
“一开始没人告诉我们这件事。
"Nobody told us about it at first.
”船上的广播则通知说，“我们对此表示歉意，但我们没有得到美国联邦政府的提前通知。
"We apologise for that, but we didn't get advance notice from the federal government," the ship's radio announcement said.
”连日来，乘客们被要求呆在自己的房间。
For days, passengers were asked to stay in their rooms.
据乘客尼尔•汉隆说：“在房间里除了坐着就是躺着，没什么运动，我觉得我们一整天也就大概走了71步。
"I think we walked about 71 steps a day," said passenger Neil Hanlon, "sitting or lying in a room with no exercise.
”一名乘客形容，船上的氛围就像是“豪华的监狱”，走廊上空无一人，每个房间都关得严严实实。
One passenger described the atmosphere as a "luxurious prison," with empty corridors and closed rooms.
而令乘客特尔•所罗门感到“恼火”的则是，邮轮自称“为了客户安全，做好了所有的健康检查”，但“除了在一张小纸上签字，没有其他的健康检查。
Passenger Terre Solomon was "annoyed" that the ship claimed to have "all the health checks in place for the safety of its customers," but "there is no other health check except on a small piece of paper."
”还有乘客称，邮轮在乘客登船前，没有进行量体温等预防措施。
Other passengers said the ship did not take temperature and other precautions before passengers boarded the ship.
乘客下船后如何安置引关注美国政府能否妥善应对？目前，最令邮轮上的乘客们和加州民众所焦虑的是，乘客下船后，将被如何安置。
How passengers get off the ship raises concerns about how the U.S. government will handle them.Passengers on board, and Californians in general, are most anxious about how passengers will be repositioned when they disembark.
相关报道指出，关于乘客和船员的安置计划如下：•船上的确诊病人将在加州的医疗机构接受治疗；•未出现症状的加州居民将在加州进行隔离观察；•非加州居民将被带往其他州进行隔离观察，包括乔治亚州的一处军事基地；•1100名船员将在船上进行隔离治疗。
There are plans to place passengers and crew in California: confirmed patients on board will be treated in California medical facilities; residents of untreated California will be quarantined in California; non-Californians will be taken to other states, including a military base in Georgia; and 1,100 sailors will be quarantined on board.
美国卫生部还表示，正在与船上数百名外国游客的母国密切联系，以安排包机接送返国。
The U.S. Department of Health also said it was working closely with the home countries of hundreds of foreign tourists on board to arrange charter flights to pick them up.
目前，加拿大方面已决定将派包机接返该国游客，但有相关症状的人将不被允许登机。
Canada has decided to send chartered flights back to the country, but people with the symptoms will not be allowed on board.
此外，中国驻旧金山总领事馆7日称，邮轮上有11名中国籍工作人员，以及9名中国大陆乘客，目前，他们健康状况稳定。
In addition, the Chinese Consulate General in San Francisco said on the 7th, 11 Chinese staff members, as well as nine mainland Chinese passengers, are in stable health.
总领馆正密切关注邮轮的停靠安排以及疫情防控措施，将根据疫情发展和当地有关规定，向船上中国公民提供领事保护与协助。
The Consulate General is closely monitoring the docking arrangements and epidemic prevention and control measures, and will provide consular protection and assistance to Chinese citizens on board in accordance with the development of the epidemic and relevant local regulations.
奥克兰市长利比•沙夫指出，该市“得到了一些非常有力的保证，他们将采用已知的最佳隔离措施”来疏散和接送乘客，邮轮上的任何人都不会被隔离或进入到社区中。
Auckland Mayor Libby Shaff said the city "has received some very strong assurances that they will use the best known isolation measures" to evacuate and pick up passengers and that no one on board will be isolated or in the community.
不过，美国住房和城市发展部部长本•卡森在接受采访时却称，特朗普政府还没有一个“完全制定好的”计划，来安置邮轮上的3500多人。
In an interview, however, Ben Carson, the head of the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, said the Trump administration had no "fully developed" plan to accommodate the more than 3,500 people on board.
《华盛顿邮报》分析称，尽管美国加强了疫情应对，但由于美国政府的指令混乱，以及部分患者无法接受检测的情况，美国的应对仍持续存在不确定性。
The Washington Post analysis said that despite the increased U.S. response to the outbreak, uncertainty persisted because of confusion over U.S. government directives and the inability of some patients to be tested.
据美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）统计，截至美东时间9日傍晚，全美已确诊至少687例病例，其中包括死亡病例22例。
By the evening of Tuesday, at least 687 cases, including 22 deaths, had been confirmed nationwide, according to CNN.
感染病例持续增加邮轮沦为病毒“温床”？除了“至尊公主”号，全球已有多艘邮轮被卷入疫情。
The number of cases continues to increase as cruise ships become "hotbeds" of the virus? In addition to the "Supreme Princess", the world has been involved in a number of cruise ships.
原本美好的海上之旅，沦为令人忧心和害怕的“噩梦”。
What used to be a wonderful sea trip turned into a "nightmare" of worry and fear.
——“阿萨拉”(Asara)邮轮逾百人乘坐了这艘邮轮享受尼罗河之旅。
More than 100 people aboard the Asara cruise line enjoyed a tour of the Nile.
但在3月5日，当“阿萨拉”邮轮到达埃及卢克索后，由于一名先前乘坐过该邮轮的游客在下船后被确诊出新冠肺炎，埃及政府对仍在的船上的人员展开检测。
But on March 5, after the ship arrived in Luxor, Egypt, the Egyptian government tested a man still on board after a former cruise passenger was diagnosed with pneumonia after disembarking.
截至目前，船上有45人的新冠病毒检测呈阳性。

One woman, an 83-year-old woman, was diagnosed with an infection in the cruise ship Rotterdam, Malaysia, on the night of February 15.
这艘邮轮遭多个国家和地区拒绝靠岸，最后经柬埔寨批准，终于在西哈努克港停靠。
The ship was denied access to several countries and regions and finally docked at Sihanouk port with Cambodian approval.
来自多国的1455名乘客和802名船员由此结束近两周的海上“漂流”。
