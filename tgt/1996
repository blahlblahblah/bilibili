当人们摘下口罩的那一天，我也会脱下防护服，与家人团聚，与亲朋举杯。
On the day people take off their masks, I take off my protective clothing, reunite with my family and raise glasses with my family and friends.
口述 | 王维武整理 | 应　琛今年春节，注定与众不同。
At Ren Chen's Spring Festival this year, Wang was destined to be special.
2020年2月13日，是我在咸宁市抗疫医疗专家组援助的第16天。
February 13, 2020, I was in Xianning City to fight against the disease medical team's assistance 16 days.
当晚，我终于和三姐王淑红见上了一面。
That night, I finally met my third sister, Wang Shuhong.
她是湖北省咸宁市公安局警令部政委，从新冠肺炎疫情爆发之初，同样也投入到繁忙的抗疫工作中。
She is a police commissar of Xianning Public Security Bureau in Hubei Province. She has also been engaged in a busy epidemic since the outbreak of the outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia.
王维武在病房了解患者病情就在我们医务人员统一入住的宾馆门口，三姐朝我直奔过来，我下意识地连退几步，对她摆摆手，示意她不要靠近。
Wang Wei-wu in the ward to understand the patient's illness in our unified hotel, Third Sister rushed to me, I involuntarily step back a few steps, waved her not to approach.
因为这里住的都是外来援助的医护人员，每天出入医院，离得太近不安全。
Because the residents here are foreign aid workers, daily access to the hospital, too close to unsafe.
在昏黄的路灯下，三姐仔细询问了我的工作近况，当我无意中说漏嘴表示，每天只是戴着口罩穿梭于各大医院，并没有其他防护装备时，三姐的泪水一下就止不住地流了下来。
Under the yellow street lamp, my third sister carefully asked me how my work was doing. When I blurted out that I was only wearing masks and shuttling through the major hospitals without any other protective equipment, my sister's tears began to flow.
01我叫王维武，湖北咸宁市崇阳县人。
My name is Wang Weiwu, from Chongyang County, Xianning City, Hubei Province.
先后在中国中医科学院、瑞典卡罗琳斯卡医学院取得博士学位并从事博士后研究工作，之后我多年定居瑞典，从事医疗及科研工作，很多年都没有回国过年了。
After receiving a Ph.D. from the Chinese Academy of Chinese Medicine and a Ph.D. degree from the Caroline Institute of Medicine in Sweden, I settled in Sweden for many years and spent many years in medical and scientific research.
在国外给老外看病前些年，家中遇到些变故，为了照顾母亲，我要求自己每年必须定期回国。
To take care of my mother, I required that I return home regularly every year.
在国内，我在湖南中医药大学第一附属医院出诊。
At home, I visited the First Affiliated Hospital of Hunan TCM University.
因为长沙离咸宁不远，每次回国，我一定会接母亲来长沙同住，以尽孝道。
Because Changsha is not far from Xianning, every time I return to China, I will take my mother to live with me in Changsha, in filial piety.
在国内出诊时今年是母亲80大寿，很早我们兄弟姐妹就相约小年夜在县城老家团聚。
In the domestic out-patient visit this year is the mother's 80th birthday, very early on our brothers and sisters in the county reunion.
不料突如其来的疫情，让所有的计划都成泡影。
Unexpectedly, the sudden outbreak of the epidemic, so that all the plans have come to naught.
很快城封了，路也封了，交通开始管制。
Soon the city was closed, the roads were closed and traffic was under control.
三姐也在第一时间投入到工作中，她每天忙着各种指令的上传下达，审核着各类信息数据的收集上报，巡查社会面的治安情况，非常劳累。
Third Sister also in the first time into the work, she is busy with the various instructions issued daily, audit the collection and reporting of various types of information, inspection of the public security situation, very tired.
王维武（前排右一）与家人合影身为一名医生，我不可能坐在家中袖手旁观，于是就在微信群里问三姐：“现在封路了，我还有什么办法可以出行吗？”三姐立即明白了我的意思，但她舍不得我去冒险，便断然拒绝了我：“没有任何办法，你就安安心心在家陪母亲吧！”心急如焚的我却意外接到了市领导的电话。
As a doctor, I couldn't sit back and watch as I was sitting at home, so I asked my sister, "Is there anything I can do about it now?" My sister immediately understood what I meant, but she refused: "There is no other way for you to stay at home with my mother.
原来有一则关于我的微信推送引起了市委领导的注意，得知我是咸宁人后就与我取得了联系。
Originally there was a micro-letter about me to the attention of the municipal party leaders, I learned that I was Xianning people after I got in contact with me.
于是，1月27日，我主动向领导请缨，加入抗疫医疗专家组。
So, January 27, I volunteered to join the leadership of the team of medical experts against the disease.
在与专家组组长、华中科技大学同济医学院杜光教授碰头后，我们一拍即合。
After meeting with Professor Du Guang of Tongji Medical School of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, we clapped.
然而，刚开始知道这个消息时，家人对我的选择并不支持，尤其是我的母亲坚决不同意。
However, when I first learned this news, my family did not support my choice, especially as my mother strongly disagreed.
我花了一整晚的时间反复给老太太做思想工作。
I spent the whole night doing ideological work for the old lady.
其间，母亲几度流泪让我非常纠结。
During this time, my mother several times tears let me very tangled.
自从10岁父亲去世后，是她一个人将我们五个兄弟姐妹拉扯大，我又是她最疼的小儿子，她的不舍与纠结我非常理解。
Since the death of her 10-year-old father, she alone brought up five of our brothers and sisters, I am her most painful little son, her reluctance and entanglement I understand very much.
当时我对她说：“如果咸宁的疫情真的爆发，我们这个小家也不可能独善其身。
At the time, I said to her: "If the Xianning outbreak really broke out, our small family is not immune.
虽然看起来危险，但我有这个信心一定能够把安全防护做到位，您不用为我担心。
As dangerous as it may seem, I am confident that I will be able to put the safety precautions in place. You needn't worry about me.
”最后，母亲是哭着同意的。
At last the mother gave her consent, weeping.
王维武（右二）与专家组组长华中科技大学同济医学院的杜光教授、昆医附二重症医学科主任王刚，云南省第二医院的邓毅书副院长合影1月29日，我正式加入咸宁市的抗疫医疗专家组。
Wang Weimu (second from right) and Professor Du Guang, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wang Gang, Director of Severe Medicine of Kunming Fu-2, Vice President of Tang Yi-shu of Yunnan No. 2 Hospital, took photos on January 29.
临行前，三姐不甘心地问：“弟，你一定要去吗？你不是订了去美国的机票，接下来不是还要去哈佛访学的吗？”见我态度坚定，三姐便不再多言。
Before she left, Third Sister reluctantly asked, Dude, do you have to go? Didn't you book a flight to America, and then you had to go to Harvard to study?
02加入专家组之后，我们每天出行的时间并不固定。
After joining the Group of Experts, our daily travel times were not fixed.
24小时待命，只要有什么情况发生，我们就要马上出发。
24-hour standby. We're leaving as soon as anything happens.
每天的事情都非常多，安排也相当紧凑。
Everyday things are very much, and the arrangements are quite tight.
专家组到通城县指导工作时，通城县委书记熊亚平同志给专家组介绍通城的防疫情况我们的主要工作是下到咸宁市的各个区县，在当地医院进行巡诊，如果遇到疑难病症，还要对其进行会诊。
When the group went to Tongcheng County to guide its work, Comrade Xiong Yaping, secretary of the Tongcheng County Party Committee, briefed the group on the epidemic prevention in the whole city.
同时，对于新开辟的即将收治新冠肺炎的医疗定点机构，我们也会到实地去检查，看它的设施、条件到不到位，符不符合要求。
At the same time, we will go to the field to inspect the newly opened medical clinic for the treatment of newly opened pneumonia, to see if its facilities and conditions are inadequate and do not meet the requirements.
此外，对那些已经作为医疗定点机构的医院，我们也要检查其发热门诊、隔离病房的设施规不规范，相应的防护和消杀措施是否到位等。
In addition, for those hospitals that have been designated as medical facilities, we should also check that the facilities of their fever clinics and isolation wards are not standardized and that the corresponding protective and sterilization measures are in place.
1月31日，我主持了一个危重症患者的会诊，印象非常深刻。
On 31 January, I presided over a very impressive consultation of critically ill patients.
他是一个65岁的男性患者，当时病情已经很凶险，CT拍下来有“白肺”，血氧饱和度也比较低，已经出现了发热、胸闷、呼吸困难等症状。
He was a 65-year-old male patient who was already in a very dangerous condition, with CT images of "white lungs," low blood oxygen saturation and fever, chest tightness, laboured breathing and so on.
经过反复的专家组讨论，最后除了常规的一些抢救方法以外，我利用了自己“中西医双修”的背景，开了一些有针对性的中药方剂。
After repeated expert group discussion, finally, in addition to some conventional rescue methods, I took advantage of my "Chinese and Western medicine double repair" background, opened some targeted Chinese medicine prescription.
值得高兴的是，这名患者经过我们专家针对性的治疗后，目前已经痊愈出院。
Happily, the patient has now recovered from hospital after our specialist's targeted treatment.
专家会诊一般情况下，我们会控制进入病房会诊的专家人数，因为一线的医疗物资是非常紧缺的，为了节约防护资源，我们会采取线上、线下远程等多种方式开展会诊工作。
Expert Consultation Generally speaking, we will control the number of specialists who will be admitted to the wards. As frontline medical supplies are in short supply, we will conduct on-line and off-line consultations in a variety of ways to conserve resources.
王维武在重症病房给患者把脉但中医讲究望闻问切，脉象和舌象通过影像是传不出来的。
Wang Wei-wu in the intensive care ward for patients but TCM care about the inquisitive, pulse and tongue through the image is unable to communicate.
因此，有时候，我也会与医院其他专家深入重症病房查房。
So, sometimes, I go deep into the intensive care unit with other hospital specialists.
每次进入病区，我们就要做好三级防护。
Every time we enter the area, we have to do a good level of protection.
而且为了不浪费隔离服，我每次进入病区的时间不低于两小时。
And in order not to waste the quarantine, I go into the area for not less than two hours at a time.
最长的一次，我进去了大约4个半小时，其间不能吃、不能喝、不能拉，感觉汗像油一样流下来，全身湿透且粘腻，一线医护人员的辛苦由此可想而知。
For the longest time, I went in for about four and a half hours, during which time I could not eat, drink or pull. I felt sweat dripping like oil.
其实，专家组有时也会到崇阳县检查工作，而我母亲就住在崇阳县人民医院旁边。
In fact, the Group occasionally visits Chongyang County to inspect work, and my mother lives next to the Chongyang People's Hospital.
当时专家组的同仁体贴我，建议我回去看望一下母亲，但我考虑到自己天天在发热门诊和隔离病房这样的高危地带活动，且母亲年事已高，虽然很想念她，但经过深思熟虑最终还是没有去。
At that time, the team of experts was considerate and advised me to go back to see my mother, but I did not do so after careful consideration, considering my daily activities in high-risk areas, such as the fever clinic and isolation ward, and because my mother was very old and missed her.
这样的情况发生了三次。
This happened three times.
当然，有空的时候，我也会给母亲打电话，但不一定每天都有时间。
Of course, when I'm free, I call my mother, too, but I don't have time every day.
因为有时从医院结束一天的工作回到宾馆已经晚上11点多了，母亲早已经入睡。
Because sometimes from the end of the day's work from the hospital back to the hotel has been more than 11 p.m., mother has fallen asleep.
除了在抗疫一线，王维武还利用自己在国内外的号召力筹款筹物资。
In addition to the first line in the fight against the epidemic, Wang Wei-wu also used their domestic and international appeal to raise funds.
图为捐给崇阳县人民医院的物资作为一名医生，我将继续坚与病毒做斗争。
Pictured here is a donation to Chongyang County People's Hospital. As a doctor, I will continue to fight the virus.
当人们摘下口罩的那一天，我也会脱下防护服，与家人团聚，与亲朋举杯。
On the day people take off their masks, I take off my protective clothing, reunite with my family and raise glasses with my family and friends.
