系列报道 | 距离武汉七百公里外，污名和赞歌同时在一座小镇上演。
Seven hundred kilometers away from Wuhan, stigma and chants were performed in a small town.
记录改变中的全球文化图景。
Record the changing global cultural landscape.
这是系列报道的第八篇，一座距离武汉 700 多公里的江阴小镇在这场疫情下的应激反应。
This is the eighth report in the series, a more than 700 km away from Wuhan Jiangyin township in this outbreak of stress response.
其中有「趋利」：抢占道德高地，用歌颂捐款老人的方式树立自己的丰碑；也包括「避害」：对「武汉人」「湖北人」乃至全体「外地人」的警戒、防备与排查，以及用污名化一位女性感染者的方式填充自己的恐慌。
Among them are "profit-seeking": to capture the moral high ground, to build up one's own monument by praising the elderly; and "to avoid harm": to "Wuhan people" "Hubei people" and all "outsiders," as well as to fill their own fear by stigmatizing a female infected person.
当然，在全国性疫情 19 天后，类似的故事每天都在各地上演：部分人自保的决心压倒了他们的同理心，以至于当真正的英勇、无畏与风险 —— 或者说崇高 —— 上演时，这些平庸的「恶」也让人倍感愤怒。
Of course, 19 days after the national epidemic, similar stories are unfolding daily everywhere: the resolve of some to protect themselves overwhelms their empathy, so that when true heroism, audacity, and risk - or nobility - are performed, these mediocre "evils" also provoke anger.
人性的测试开始了吗？早已开始。
Has the test of humanity begun? It has already begun.
「传染病」带来的气氛总是相似的。
"Communicable diseases" always bring the same atmosphere.
2016 年秋天，当我老家的小镇突然多了很多伤寒症病人时，首先被关掉的就是镇上的活禽店、饭馆和熟食店。
In the fall of 2016, when the town of my hometown suddenly had many more typhoid sufferers, the town's live poultry shops, restaurants and deli were the first to be shut down.
这个消息是父母告诉我的。
My parents told me the news.
我从北京回家，他们来车站接我并把我拉到了镇上唯一一家还在营业的饭店。
When I got home from Beijing, they met me at the station and took me to the only open restaurant in town.
两百多平方米的饭店一楼，只剩下两桌人吃饭，另一桌是外国人。
On the ground floor of the 200-square-meter hotel, there were only two tables left for dinner and one for foreigners.
小镇位于江苏省江阴市，四通八达，因乡镇企业繁荣，这里吸引了很多外地打工者，包括在此就业或来此洽谈生意的外商。
Located in Jiangyin, Jiangsu Province, the town is well connected and has attracted many migrant workers, including those working here or coming here to discuss business, because of the boom in township enterprises.
餐饮业突然萧条，夜晚灯火都少了一半。
The restaurant industry was suddenly depressed, and lights fell by half at night.
据说市里正在努力追查病因，我的一个远方亲戚，也因发烧感冒被隔离。
The city is said to be trying to trace the cause, and one of my distant relatives was quarantined with a fever and a cold.
我想起 2003 年的非典，那种像被捂在被窝里的人心惶惶。
I think of the SARS in 2003, the kind of people who are covered with bedclothes.
后来我们不再外出就餐，而关于这场流行病，一直没有确切消息，只有流言不断传来。
Later we stopped eating out, and there was no definitive news about the epidemic, only rumors continued to circulate.
比如有人说是镇上富人新买的马匹死了，埋葬时没做好措施，病毒渗入了饮用水。
For example, it was said that the newly bought horse of a rich man in the town died and was buried without proper precautions.
为了证明这个流言的可靠性，还有人举证「零号病人」确实就生活在马场附近。
To prove the reliability of the rumor, it has also been proven that Patient Zero did live near the racecourse.
有一天我坐公交车去市区，前排两个老太太也在聊这件事。
One day I took a bus downtown and two old ladies in the front row were talking about it.
其中一个看着车窗外大门紧闭的餐馆说，这些倒霉老板不知什么时候才能重新开业，另一个说上面很快就会查明原因的。
One of them looked out the window at the locked door and said the unlucky bosses didn't know when to reopen. Another said it would soon find out why.
前一个老太太斩钉截铁地说肯定是马的问题，后一个老太太赶紧让她小声点，说小心被人举报，某某村的某某人已经因为造谣而被抓起来了。
The former said firmly that it must be a horse problem, the latter old lady hastened to tell her to be careful to be reported, so that someone in the village had been arrested for disinformation.
又过几天，我妈也焦虑了。
A few days later, my mother was worried, too.
虽然没有数据表明有多少人得病，甚至没有证据证明这就是一场传染病，但我妈开始一反常态地催我回北京。
Although there was no data on how many people got sick, or even evidence of an infectious disease, my mother began to rush me back to Beijing in an unusual way.
当时传闻，说如果伤寒症再严重下去，或许会不让人出城。
It was rumored at the time that if typhoid fever continued unabated, people might not be allowed out of town.
我再回家时已是那年春节，镇上已经恢复了往日生机。
It was Spring Festival that year when I returned home, and the town had come to life again.
秋天的风波并未形成真正的风暴，它就像一部小说的开头，平静之下的汹涌暗流本可以把它冲向一个更为糟糕的境地。
The autumn storm did not form a real storm. It was like the beginning of a novel, which could have been thrown into a worse position by the turbulent undercurrent of calm.
然而已经没人记得虚惊一场背后的侥幸。
But no one remembers the fluke behind a false alarm.
那支箭最终射向了武汉。
The arrow finally hit Wuhan.
如果靶心是十环，那么七百多公里以外的家乡小镇最多就是五环。
If the target is 10 rings, then more than 700 kilometers away from home town is the five rings at most.
1 月中旬，我回到镇上时，人们都还在红红火火地准备过年。
When I got back to town in mid-January, people were still in full swing for the New Year.
1 月 20 日前后，即便很多媒体开始报道武汉疫情，人们也依然没有意识到事情的严重性。
Around January 20, people were unaware of the seriousness of the situation, even as much media coverage of the Wuhan outbreak began.
对于我的父母及亲友来说，公共事件只有被中央电视台这样的官方媒体盖章认证才具有公共属性。
For my parents and friends, public events are public only if they are stamped and certified by official media such as CCTV.
春节前的聚餐照常进行，有两家亲戚还在饭桌上兴致勃勃地描述了即将到来的自驾游。
Dinner before the Spring Festival proceeded as usual, with two relatives gaily describing the upcoming drive-by at the dinner table.
1 月 23 日，我和父母谈及新型冠状病毒引起的肺炎时，他们仍旧不以为然。
When my parents and I talked about pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus on January 23, they were still not impressed.
「湖北离我们这儿远着呢！」「这里的湖北人不多的！」他们大半辈子都在小镇生活，对于镇外人员的流动速度和江阴到武汉的实际距离一无所知。
"Hubei is far from us!" "There are not many Hubei people here!" They spent most of their lives in the town, knowing nothing about the speed of the flow of people from outside the town and the actual distance between Jiangyin and Wuhan.
那天我们去超市采购春节物资时，超市正大音量地播放着刘德华的《恭喜发财》，戴口罩的人寥寥无几。
The day we went to the supermarket to buy Spring Festival supplies, the supermarket is playing "Congratulation" Liu Dehua, very few people wearing masks.
疫情像掉在宣纸上的一滴墨汁，不断蔓延。
The epidemic is like a drop of ink dropped on rice paper, spreading.
确诊人数迅速上升，小镇终于不觉得自己能置身事外了。
With the number of confirmed cases rising rapidly, the town did not feel able to stay out of the way.
公共场所必须戴口罩，除超市、菜市场等生活必需的场所外，舞厅、饭店、电影院都关门了。
Public places must wear masks, in addition to supermarkets, Halles market and other places necessary for life, dance halls, restaurants, cinemas are closed.
口罩一时成为稀缺产品，杂货店、水果摊门口都吊着黄色硬纸板，上写「内有一次性口罩，欲购从速」。
Mask became scarce for a while, and yellow cardboard hung at the door of grocery stores and fruit stands, saying, "Have a disposable mask to buy quickly."
一棵白菜售价 32 块的图片开始在家庭群传阅，在菜市场外，一个老太太大声抱怨说：「怎么涨价这么多！」马路上车变得极少，行驶在开往邻镇的外环路上，竟有一种打电动游戏的错觉。
A picture of a Chinese cabbage selling for $32 began to circulate among the family. Outside the Halles, an old lady complained loudly, "Why is the price so high?" The road became so rare that there was an illusion of playing video games on the outer ring road to a neighbouring town.
小区关了两扇门，唯一开的那扇只留一辆车的宽度。
The small area closed two doors, the only open car left only a car width.
保安拿着体温计给人测体温，然而他们并没有正确佩戴口罩 —— 口罩只捂住了嘴，他们用鼻子呼吸。
The security guards took the thermometer and took the temperature, but they did not wear the mask properly - they covered their mouths and they breathed through their noses.
那几天，排查「武汉人」「湖北人」一夜之间变成了「谁是卧底」行动。
In those days, the search for "Wuhan people" and "Hubei people" became overnight "undercover operation."
之后又变成了「谁是外地人」行动。
Then came the "Who's a stranger" operation.
我奶奶生于 1945 年，她很少看新闻，我们向她解释疫情时说：「非典又要来了。
My grandmother was born in 1945. She seldom reads the news. We explained to her that SARS was coming again.
」她词不达意地反问：「那这次运动什么时候结束？」2 月 2 日，江阴市感染「新冠病毒」的首例肺炎患者被确认。
"When will the campaign end?" she asked wryly. "On February 2, the first case of pneumonia in Jiangyin was confirmed.
她姓周，1 月 17 日至 19 日期间陪同武汉友人在江阴游玩，其中有一人被确诊为病例。
Her surname is Zhou, January 17 to 19 accompanied Wuhan friends in Jiangyin play, one of them was diagnosed as a case.
为找到相关接触者，官方详细地公布了周女士的行程：1 月 17 日下午三点半到四点，她曾在某麻辣烫店吃饭；1 月 18 日她曾到某酒店聚会；1 月 19 日她曾去某休闲食品店买零食；1 月 20 日她曾在某超市旁的摊位贴手机膜……随之而来的是更加严密的防控 —— 进出小区和菜市场都需要携带身份证，菜市场营业时间缩短为每天上午，去邻镇的路被封锁，主要路段安排志愿者做体温测试。
She dined at a spicy restaurant between 3: 30 p.m. on January 17, had a snack at a restaurant on January 18, had a snack bar at a supermarket on January 19, followed by tighter controls - ID cards were needed in the neighborhood and on the Halles market.
第二例、第三例出现了。
A second and third case occurred.
亲友们所在的当地群如点燃的爆仗，言辞突然激烈起来。
A firefight ignited in the local community where the relatives and friends were present suddenly turned violent.
首例病患的照片、微信朋友圈截图迅速流传，有人甚至以「毒王」一词来称呼她。
Photographs of the first patient and pictures of her close friends spread quickly, and some even referred to her as "King of Poison."
之后是一轮更为猛烈的羞辱，说这个女人有 11 个姘头，病毒潜伏期间她已与这 11 人发生性关系。
This was followed by a further round of humiliation, saying that the woman had 11 concubines with whom she had had sexual relations during the incubation period.
稍有理智的人在看到官方公布的行程后都能意识到这个流言的荒诞，然而人人自危时暴露的自私还是为流言提供了土壤。
Even the sane are aware of the absurdity of the rumor when they see the official itinerary, but the selfishness they expose when they are in danger provides a breeding ground for gossip.
有人在群里用脏话辱骂她，有人言之凿凿地拿出了开房的证据，甚至说她的三个姘头为了健康已经主动向公安承认事实。
She had been verbally abused in the group, and some had given evidence of the opening of the house, even saying that her three concubines had voluntarily confessed to the police for health reasons.
事情不断发酵，直到 2 月 3 日江阴市公安局发布辟谣信息。
Things continued to ferment until February 3, when the Jiangyin Public Security Bureau issued a rumor denial message.
36 岁的蔡某和 26 岁的缪某被认为是散布谣言的始作俑者，而她们造谣的原因是「出于好奇，为吸引眼球」。
Tsai, 36, and Mumou, 26, are believed to have started the rumor-mongering campaign "out of curiosity to catch the eye."
「原来是假的啊。
"It's not true.
」网络上的人群四散开去。
"The people on the network dispersed.
有人说：「这女的平时肯定也不检点，不然怎么会传这样的谣呢？」因为长时间在家，每个人的春节都过得相当漫长。
Some people said: "This woman is certainly impolite, otherwise how can you spread such a rumor?" Because long time at home, everyone's Spring Festival is quite a long time.
我身边的亲友，大多数人更关心自身的处境而非武汉人的惊心动魄。
Most of the friends and relatives around me are more concerned about their own situation than Wuhan people's thrilling.
三年前的那支箭最终没有射向我们，我们也意识不到自己随时会变成武汉人。
Three years ago that arrow did not finally shoot at us, we do not realize that they will become Wuhan at any time.
人们的日常抱怨主要有猪肉价格的持续上涨、高速公路被封后吃不到外地的鱼肉了、买不到口罩以及无法与自己相处带来的庞大焦虑和无聊。
Daily complaints include rising pork prices, blocked freeways from eating fish out of the field, the lack of masks, and the huge anxiety and boredom of being unable to get along with others.
入冬以来，江南地区鲜有阳光普照时，二月初终于迎来了几天的晴朗。
After few sunny days in the southern part of the country since the beginning of winter, the beginning of February finally ushered in a few days of sunshine.
家家户户洗了衣服、晾了棉被，立春时，我们用面粉搓小圆子放在甜汤里吃。
Households washed their clothes and hung quilts to dry. In the spring, we rubbed flour into small bowls and ate them in sweet soup.
奶奶的菜地种得很好，我这才知道，小时候常吃的野菜马兰已经变成了人类驯养的蔬菜。
Grandma's vegetable field is very good, I know that when I was a child, the wild vegetable Malan has become a domesticated vegetable.
她说她种过台湾马兰，后来水土不服，全死了。
She said she had planted Maran in Taiwan and later died of acclimatization.
家里口罩有限，我便不再出门。
With a limited supply of masks, I stopped going out.
湖北的确诊病例每天都以千计增加，终于有一天，我爸去菜市场时发现鸡蛋卖完了。
The number of confirmed cases in Hubei increased by a thousand every day. Finally, my father went to the vegetable market and found that the eggs were sold out.
「所以武汉的真实情况到底怎样了？」父母相信的堡垒终于有了一丝裂缝。
"So the truth of Wuhan after all how?" Parents believe that the fortress finally has a crack.
身处七百多公里以外，我无从判断我知道的信息是否已被污染，更无法解释「真实」。
More than seven hundred kilometers away, I have no way of telling if the information I know is contaminated, much less "true."
江阴首例确诊患者的谣言被击碎后，同一批网民开始无缝对接地赞颂一个以拾荒为生的老人。
After rumors of Jiangyin's first confirmed case were shattered, the same netizens began to praise grounding seamlessly an old man who scavenged for a living.
视频先是在微博上流传的。
The video first circulated on microblogs.
这个善良的老太太今年 73 岁，某天上午拿了 9000 元钱到村委会，说想捐给武汉。
The kind-hearted old lady, 73, came to the village committee one morning with 9000 yuan and said she wanted to donate it to Wuhan.
村里念及她谋生不易，婉拒了她的好意。
Mindful of her difficulty in earning a living, the village declined her offer.
老太太着急，她说武汉人民有难，而她还可以再赚钱 —— 下午又送去 1000 元 —— 她共捐出了 1 万元。
The old lady was in a hurry. She said the Wuhan people were in trouble and she could make more money--another thousand yuan in the afternoon -- and she donated 10,000 yuan.
她的慷慨被同乡人广为赞颂，仿佛这样我们就可以被天然地归入正义的阵营。
Her generosity was widely praised by fellow countrymen, as if we could be naturally drawn into the camp of justice.
就像每次有大事发生时，我们都靠自我感动来自我疗愈。
It's like every time something big happens, we all heal from our own ego.
2 月 5 日，我在朋友圈看到一篇文章，标题是《江阴捡垃圾为生的大妈给武汉捐款万元，连沈鹏都被打动为其写下诗作》。
Feb. 5, I saw an article in a circle of friends, entitled "Jiangyin garbage collection for a living aunt donation to Wuhan, even Shen Peng was moved to write poems.
我好奇这篇文章到底是在赞美老太太的善心还是在强调她被沈鹏当作了素材？而且，沈鹏到底是谁？我点开了这篇文章。
I wonder whether this article is really praising the old lady's kindness or emphasizing that she is used as material by Shen Peng. And, who is Shen Peng? I ordered this article.
「吾邑冠百强，徐姨犹拾荒。
"My city crown hundred top 100, Aunt Xu scavenges.
」短暂介绍老太太的善举后，诗人开始了洋洋洒洒的书写。
"After a brief introduction to the old lady's good deeds, the poet began to write freely.
「一方有灾难，同为炎黄裔！感动彼上苍，疫菌亦当悲。
"One side has the disaster, simultaneously is the phlogistic yellow color! Moves that one heaven, the pestilence also should mourn.
明日徐姨起，夜半不闻鸡。
She rose at midnight and did not hear of the chicken.
速速拾荒去，灾区一脉系。
Hurry to scavenge, a disaster area.
拾荒唯俯首，可敬仰天齐！」这是赞美诗的最后几句。
The scavenger is bent, the sky is high! "This is the last words of the hymn.
然后，文章从沈鹏 15 岁创办文学刊物一直到他的书法成就，从他外祖父曾捐资创办城南小学一直到他捐赠名人字画，都有提及。
The article then begins with Shen Peng's 15-year-old literary journal to his achievements in calligraphy, from his grandfather's donation to the founding of Chengnan Primary School to his donation of famous characters and paintings.
我关闭了那个窗口。
I closed the window.
歌颂弱者的牺牲，是盗取道德最有效的方式。
The most effective way to steal morality is to extol the sacrifice of the weak.
精明者深谙此道，我们的话语系统也深谙此道。
The astute know well, and our speech system knows it well.
我们距离武汉多远啊？七百多公里。
How far are we from Wuhan? More than seven hundred kilometers.
又有多近呢？阳光充沛的日子很短，我们又迎来了连绵不绝的阴天。
How close are we? The sunny days are short, and we have a continuous cloudy day.
我妈说第二天可能会下雪。
My mother said it might snow the next day.
我说我已经很多年没见过江南的雪了。
I said I had not seen snow in Jiangnan in many years.
后来雪没有落下来。
Then the snow did not fall.
等家人睡了后，我给自己倒了杯酒。
When my family went to bed, I poured myself a glass of wine.
「晚来天欲雪，能饮一杯无？」天上没有月亮。
"Snowy late, can drink a cup of no?" There is no moon in the sky.
