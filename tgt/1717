除了菜品的装卸、运送外，我还要负责为各个医院不同的人群制定不同的菜谱。
In addition to the handling and delivery of dishes, I am also responsible for the different groups of people in each hospital to make different recipes.
比如，护士群体需要增加抗疲劳的食材，专家组的菜品可略微清淡，而建筑工人的菜单，则需要大油大荤。
For example, the nursing community needs to add fatigue-fighting ingredients, the panel's food can be slightly light, and the builders' menus need a lot of fuel.
口述 | 石在余整理 | 刘朝晖昨晚到今天，我和我的兄弟们干了一个通宵，因为要紧急制作1800份早餐。
At AT & nbsp; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45
现在我还是不能睡，新的一天，我们还有沉甸甸的任务，武汉还有很多医院和志愿者在等着我们配送午餐和晚餐。
Now I still can not sleep, the new day, we still have a heavy mission, Wuhan and many hospitals and volunteers waiting for us to deliver lunch and dinner.
从封城到现在，我们每天做的事情，就是让那些在抗疫一线的人们，能吃上热腾腾的免费新鲜饭菜。
From the city to the present, what we do every day is to let those in the front line of the epidemic, can eat hot and free fresh meals.
我叫石在余，是一家自选中餐连锁品牌“大米先生”在武汉的区域行政总厨。
My name is Shi Yu, is an optional Chinese food chain brand "Mr. Rice" in Wuhan's regional executive chef.
在武汉我们有160多家门店，疫情一来基本都关闭了，现在只有十几家经允许特别营业。
In Wuhan, we have more than 160 stores, the outbreak of the epidemic has been basically closed, now only a dozen or so special permission to operate.
就靠着这十几家店，我们每天要为武汉的医院和隔离点等，提供上万份饭菜。
Relying on a dozen or so shops, we serve tens of thousands of meals a day to Wuhan hospitals and isolation points.
石在余在为医护人员送盒饭一万份米饭送到晚上八点大年三十，网上流传着武汉的医护人员吃饭有困难的消息，我们在重庆的总部得知后，立即从库房中调出4000份自热米饭，又召回部分已放假的工人，大年初一赶制出6000份自热米饭，凑成10000份运往武汉。
Some 10,000 pieces of rice were sent to Wuhan on the first day of the Lunar New Year. When our headquarters in Chongqing learned that it was difficult for Wuhan medical workers to eat, we immediately brought 4,000 pieces of self-heating rice from the warehouse and recalled some of the workers who had already had holidays.
由于交通管制，运送过程并不顺利。
Because of traffic control, the transportation process is not smooth.
我们的同事通过发朋友圈求助，最终在热心市民的帮助下，才找到了相关部门办好了手续。
Our colleagues through the circle of friends for help, in the end, with the help of interested citizens, we found the relevant departments to do a good job.
通过湖北慈善总会等部门协调、帮助，大年初三，我和五名同事一起，又是卸货又是装车的，把4000多份自热盒饭送到了武汉大学中南医院。
Through the Hubei Charities Association and other departments to coordinate, help, New Year's Day, I and five colleagues, but also unloading and loading, more than 4000 boxes of rice to Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital.
其余的送到武昌区卫健委，由卫健委统一分配给武昌区各大医院。
The rest were sent to Wuchang District Health Committee, by the health committee to the major hospitals in Wuchang District.
弄了整整一天，一直忙到晚上八点，大家伙都累得不行，但是心里还是很欣慰的。
All day long, until 8 pm, the big guys are tired, but still very happy.
接收的人员对我们表示感谢，我说应该感谢的是公司，我们只是代表企业在前线做事。
The people we received thanked us and I said it was the company that was to thank. We were just working on behalf of the company on the front line.
自热米饭运抵中南医院我也知道，这10000份米饭对于武汉各大医院来说，只是杯水车薪。
Hot rice has arrived at Zhongnan Hospital. I also know that the 10,000 pieces of rice are only a drop in the bucket for Wuhan major hospitals.
要想给在前线奋战的医护人员提供帮助，我们必须尽自己所能，用自己的资源，给他们更多的支持。
If we are going to help the medical staff fighting on the front lines, we must do everything we can to give them more support with our own resources.
正好烹饪协会发了招志愿者的通知，我又是协会会员，第一个就报了名。
The Cooking Association just sent out a call for volunteers, I was also a member of the Association, the first on the name.
然后我就在微信的公司群里进行了倡议，很多人都是我的徒弟，大家报名都非常踊跃。
Then I took the initiative in a group of micro-credit companies, many of which were my apprentices, and everyone signed up very well.
到后来，报名的人太多，居然都要托关系走后门了。
Later, the registration of too many people, unexpectedly have to resort to the back door relationship.
为“火神山”工地送餐由于很多餐饮企业都关门了，武汉的医院、隔离点的酒店等，对于餐饮的需求真的是很大。
Food delivery for the "Mountain of Fire" construction site Because many catering enterprises are closed, Wuhan hospitals, isolated point hotels, and so on, the demand for food is really large.
我们主动与烹饪协会、各大医院、商务局等进行对接，了解他们的需求，我的微信里最近已经新建了有将近30个群，都是进行需求对接和协调的。
We have reached out to cooking associations, major hospitals, business offices, etc., to understand their needs, and I have recently built nearly 30 new groups in my micro-letters, all of which are demand-docked and coordinated.
还有一些志愿者车队，运送患者和医护人员，还有物资，也是在为抗击疫情做出贡献，我们也会为他们提供免费盒饭。
There are also volunteer convoys carrying patients and medical personnel, as well as supplies, which also contribute to the fight against the epidemic, and we provide them with free meals in boxes.
这些群每天都很热闹，各个用餐单位会不断发来当日的订餐数量，然后我要再协调落实，派单给十几家店，几乎没有空闲。
These groups are very busy every day, the various dining units will continue to send the number of the day's orders, and then I will coordinate implementation, to a dozen or so shops, almost no free time.
随着各地援助的医疗队不断前来，这些数量也在不断增加。
These numbers are also increasing with the arrival of medical teams assisted from all over the world.
有个医院的微信群里面，有个医生发了一句：我终于吃到米饭了，我们都十几天没有吃到米饭了。
There is a hospital in the micro-group, a doctor said: I finally eat rice, we have not had rice for a decade.
当时我们看到那个信息，既为医护人员能吃上我们送的免费餐食高兴，鼻子也有点酸。
At the time, we saw that message, both for the health care workers can eat our free meals happy, the nose is a bit sour.
火神山医院开工建设后，听说担任建设任务的中建三局伙食供应不上，我们主动联系了中建三局。
After the construction of the Fosen Mountain Hospital, I heard that the construction task of the three China Construction Bureau Catering is not available, we took the initiative to contact China Construction Bureau three.
对方开始说要付费，我说你们是在为抗击疫情做贡献，我们能为你们提供免费的盒饭，机会难得，弄得对方也挺不好意思的。
The other side began to pay, I said you are contributing to the fight against the epidemic, we can provide you with a free box of rice, the opportunity to make each other very embarrassed.
于是我们每天往工地上送午餐和晚餐，有700多份，到火神山医院完工，六天时间里一共送了4000多份免费盒饭。
So we sent more than 700 lunches and dinners to the construction site every day to the Mount Huoshen Hospital, delivering more than 4,000 free meals in six days.
Play火神山工地的工人们吃上了热盒饭两荤一素的盒饭送到火神山工地上，工人们对菜品的味道还是满意，但是不少人反映说饭量少了。
Workers at the Play Fire Mountain site ate two meat-and-two-meat boxes of hot-boxed rice and delivered them to the Flamingo Hill site. Workers were satisfied with the taste of the food, but many said they ate less.
我反应过来，建筑工人体力消耗巨大，一般标准饭量的盒饭无法满足他们的胃口，所以接下来我们不仅加大了饭量，还在菜里增加油荤，让工人师傅们能吃饱吃好。
I responded that construction workers were so physically exhausted that a normal boxed meal did not satisfy their appetite, so we not only increased the amount of meat we ate, but also increased the number of meat in the food so that the masters of the workers could eat and eat.
1800份早餐需求突如其来现在，我们每天要提供一万份左右的免费盒饭，包括午餐和晚餐，其中有将近一半是送往各大医院。
Today, we offer around 10,000 free lunches and dinners, nearly half of which are delivered to major hospitals.
长航医院、协和医院、肺科医院、第四医院……有七八家医院都是我们在负责送餐。
Changhang Hospital, Concorde Hospital, Lung Hospital, Fourth Hospital... there are seven or eight hospitals are in charge of food delivery.
这段时间以来，医护人员对我们免费送餐的行动都表示了感谢，能够被他们认可，我们的心里也热腾腾暖洋洋的。
For some time now, health care workers have expressed their gratitude for our free meals. They have recognized us, and our hearts are warm and warm.
医护人员表达谢意的微信2月18日晚上，我的微信群里突然发来信息，同济医院中法新区院区需要1800份早餐。
On the night of Feb. 18, a message came from my microphone group that 1,800 breakfasts were needed in the French New District of Tongji Hospital.
对接的主任说，他们的医生护士早餐一直在吃牛奶加面包之类，想吃点热乎的早餐。
The docking director said their doctor and nurse had been eating milk and bread for breakfast and wanted something hot for breakfast.
当时已经接近夜里10点40，这一下搞得我有点手忙脚乱。
It was close to 10: 40 in the night, and it made me a little nervous.
之前我们每天送的早餐总共也就一千多份，而同济医院这次一家就是好几个医院的量。
Before we sent a total of more than 1000 breakfast, and Tongji Hospital this time a number of hospitals.
我立即召集各家店的店长，在群里开会进行紧急部署，询问哪家店能接单。
I immediately called the store chiefs and held a meeting in the group to make an emergency deployment and ask which store would take the order.
这个突然之间下的单这么大，又比较急，配单的群里，店长们看到都有点害怕。
This suddenly under the single so large, but also more urgent, with orders in the group, shop chiefs see are a bit afraid.
我的想法是，这个单我们必须要拿下来，一定要满足医生护士们的这个愿望。
My idea is that we have to take this down and make sure the doctors and nurses have the same wish.
经过连夜忙碌调配，我们终于将这1800份早餐的原料都落实了，然后就是紧急的制作，然后9个人再去一家家店里用最快的速度将做好的早餐打包装进保温箱，此外还要协调车辆，联系医院办出城的通行证。
After a long night of hard work, we finally got all the ingredients for the 1800 breakfasts ready, then made them urgently, and then nine people went to the stores and packed the breakfast in the incubator as quickly as we could, in addition to coordinating the vehicles and contacting the hospital for a pass out of town.
我们要赶在7点前将早餐送到医生护士们的手上，因为7点后他们上班了，就没办法吃早餐了。
We have to get breakfast in the hands of the doctors and nurses before 7: 00, because they can't eat breakfast after 7: 00.
2月19日早上6点，我们出发赶往40公里外的蔡甸中法新城同济医院，终于在6点40分将早餐送到了医院。
On 19 February, at 6 a.m., we left for Tongji Hospital in Tongji, Cai Fa Xincheng, 40 kilometres away, and finally arrived at the hospital at 6.40 a.m.
为了这1800份早餐，我和一帮同事整整忙了一个通宵。
I worked all night with a bunch of colleagues for this 1800 breakfasts.
这份早餐有两个鸡蛋、一杯豆浆，一个烧麦、两个蒸饺和一个馒头，希望这些富含蛋白质的营养，能够帮助医生护士和专家们提供自己的免疫抵抗力。
The breakfast consists of two eggs, a glass of soy milk, a roast wheat, two steamed dumplings and a steamed bun. It is hoped that these protein-rich nutrients will help doctors, nurses and experts provide their own immunity.
元宵节的汤圆让护士掉泪除了菜品的装卸、运送外，我还要负责为各个医院不同的人群制定不同的菜谱。
In addition to handling and delivering food, I am also responsible for making different recipes for different groups of people in different hospitals.
比如，护士群体需要增加抗疲劳的食材，专家组的菜品可略微清淡，而建筑工人的菜单，则需要大油大荤。
For example, the nursing community needs to add fatigue-fighting ingredients, the panel's food can be slightly light, and the builders' menus need a lot of fuel.
虽然我们的原料采购目前基本还能满足需求，但是非常时期，也不是那么丰富，所以我就要想办法在菜品上翻翻花样。
Although our raw material procurement can still basically meet the demand, but the extraordinary period, is not so rich, so I have to find a way to turn over the dishes.
比如说最近原料里鸭子比较多，我们就从口味上来改变了。
Recently, for example, we have more ducks in the raw materials, so we have changed our tastes.
今天是红烧鸭子，明天就做大王烧鸭，后天就做卤鸭腿。
Today is roast duck, tomorrow will be king roast duck, the day after tomorrow to do halogen duck legs.
做法上不一样。
The approach is different.
吃的人也会有不一样的感受，不会倒胃口。
People who eat will have different feelings and will not turn their stomach.
我们的菜单拉出来一个星期都不会重复。
Our menu won't be repeated for a week.
这个时期，大家心情都不太好，我们希望尽量从饮食上也让大家心情愉悦起来，食欲好一点，增加对病毒的抵抗力。
At this time, everyone is not in a good mood, we hope to make people happy from the diet, better appetite, increase resistance to the virus.
厨师在紧张备餐有的医院还会有清真餐食和素食的需求数量发过来，我们也能满足他们的需求。
Cooks are busy preparing meals and some hospitals will have halal meals and vegetarian food demand sent over, we can also meet their needs.
定制的清真餐，菜品以牛羊肉和鱼类为主，进行单独包装。
Custom halal meals, dishes to beef and mutton and fish-based, separate packaging.
素食则是蔬菜、土豆、胡萝卜什么的。
Vegetarian dishes are vegetables, potatoes, carrots and so on.
元宵节那天，我们还特地在盒饭外加送了7000份汤圆，里面还有枸杞和蛋花。
On the Lantern Festival, we also specially sent 7,000 copies of Chinese wolfberry and egg flower to the boxed rice bowl.
送餐的时候，我看到有好几个护士在看到居然有汤圆的时候，眼里都含着泪花。
As I delivered the meal, I saw several nurses with tears in their eyes when they saw the soup bowl.
元宵佳节，这些医护人员都不能与家人团聚，我们送上这份汤圆，也是想尽我们所能，给他们更暖心的关怀。
The Lantern Festival, these medical personnel are not able to reunite with their families, we send this dumpling, also want to do all we can to give them more warm care.
Play中新网的报道视频儿子说我是英雄我们在武汉现在有一百多个员工在坚持工作。
My son says I'm a hero. We now have more than 100 employees in Wuhan working hard.
很多人每天早上4点多就要起来，5点钟到岗，洗菜淘米，加工烹饪、包装盒饭……我也要经常到各店巡视，有时候会亲自下厨帮他们炒菜，送盒饭。
Many people will get up at 4: 00 am every morning, 5 o'clock to the post, washing vegetables and rice, processing cooking, packaging rice... I also often to shop around, sometimes cook their own cooking to help them cook, box rice.
每天都是要忙到晚上八点以后，我才能拖着疲惫的身体回宿舍休息，弟兄们也一样辛苦。
Every day is busy until after 8 pm, I can drag the tired body back to the dormitory to rest, the brothers are just as hard.
由于公交都停了，私家车也不让开，有个同事上下班都要骑一个半小时的共享单车。
As the bus stops and private cars are not allowed, a colleague has to ride a bike for an hour and a half to get to work.
小区的封闭管理，也给我们工作带来了一些不便。
The closed management of the community has also brought some inconvenience to our work.
前几天有一家店里八个人，有五个被封小区出不来，只靠三个人完成了当天任务。
A few days ago there were eight people in a shop, five of which could not get out of the house.
好在这两天经过和社区的协调沟通，我们的员工基本都能顺利到岗了。
Fortunately, over the past two days and community coordination and communication, our staff can basically be smooth to the post.
虽然很累，但是我们的热情都很高涨，精神都很饱满。
Although very tired, but our enthusiasm is very high, the spirit is very full.
在群里，大家都会互相点赞，团队意识都很强。
In the group, everyone will praise each other, a strong sense of team.
大家都意识到，我们是在做一件非常有意义的事情，是在为社会做贡献。
We are all aware that we are doing a very meaningful thing and making a contribution to society.
我们做餐饮的不像一线的医护人员，我们苦点累点，但是比起他们的危险和辛苦，就不算什么了。
We don't cook like front-line staff. We work harder, but it's nothing compared to their danger and toil.
不过等疫情过去，还是要对这些辛苦付出的员工进行表彰的。
However, when the epidemic is over, we must pay tribute to these hard-working employees.
石在余在装运盒饭本来春节我是要准备回家的，家里一堆事。
Stone in Yu in carrying boxed rice originally Spring Festival I was ready to go home, a pile of things at home.
山东老家的父亲病重住院，8岁的儿子也在重庆的家里等我回去。
My father in Shandong was seriously ill in hospital, and my 8-year-old son was waiting for me at home in Chongqing.
被关在武汉，说不心急是假的，没能回去陪伴家人也挺遗憾的，觉得挺对不住他们的。
Caged in Wuhan, said not anxious is false, did not go back to accompany their families is also very regrettable, feel quite wrong with them.
不过想想，既然留在了这里，就踏踏实实地做些事吧。
But think of it, since you are here, do something solid.
家里人都对我表示了理解和支持。
My family expressed their understanding and support for me.
每天，我都会和父亲和家里人进行视频通话，他们也很关切我的身体，叮嘱我注意安全。
Every day, I would have a video conversation with my father and family, who were also concerned about my health and told me to be careful.
父亲和我说，要是他还年轻，也一样会做出和我一样的选择。
My father and I said that if he had been young, he would have made the same choice as I did.
前不久，长江日报采访了我，也对我们团队的事情进行了报道。
Not long ago, Changjiang Daily interviewed me and reported on the work of our team.
我把这件事告诉了家里，儿子在视频中对我竖起了大拇指，还说：“爸爸成大英雄了！”我的心里面就有那种欣慰和自豪的感觉。
I told the story to the family, my son in the video thumbs up to me, and said: "Dad has become a hero!" I have that kind of relief and pride in my heart.
儿子的话鼓舞了我，我一定要为他做个榜样出来。
My son's words inspired me and I must set an example for him to follow.
其实我不算什么英雄，那些战斗在抗疫一线的人才是英雄。
In fact, I am not a hero, those fighting in the front line of the epidemic is a hero.
有这些英雄在，武汉一定会渡过难关。
With these heroes, Wuhan will certainly tide over the difficulties.
