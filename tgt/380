南都，换一种方式。
Nandu, a different way.
1月底，李文亮的名字才第一次被大众所知，此前他只是“被训诫的武汉医生”。
It was only at the end of January that Li Wenliang's name became known to the public for the first time, after he became "the admonished Wuhan doctor."
在此之前，这场疫病还被称为“不明原因肺炎”。
Prior to this, the disease was also known as "unidentified pneumonia."
身为临床医生，他在群里提醒同学注意防护，但自己不幸感染，并住进了重症监护室。
As a clinician, he alerted his classmates to the precautions in the group, but was unfortunately infected and moved into intensive care.
2月1日，他发出了最后一条微博：“今天核酸检测结果阳性，尘埃落定，终于确诊了。
On February 1, he sent out his last microblog: "Today the nucleic acid test results are positive, the dust settled, finally confirmed.
”谁也没想到，未满35岁的李文亮医生，很快走到了生命的结尾。
"No one expected that Dr. Li Wenliang, under the age of 35, would soon be at the end of his life.
提醒让家人亲人注意防范2019年12月30日，武汉市中心医院眼科医生李文亮看到一份病人的检测报告，“检出SARS冠状病毒高置信度阳性指标”。
Reminder to remind family members to guard against December 30, 2019, Wuhan Central Hospital ophthalmologist Li Wenliang saw a patient's test report, "Detected SARS coronavirus high confidence positive index."
当天下午五点多，他在大学同学微信群中发了几句话：“华南海鲜市场确诊了7例SARS”“最新消息是，冠状病毒感染确定了，正在进行病毒分型”“大家不要外传，让家人亲人注意防范”。
The latest information is that the coronavirus infection has been confirmed and a virus is being typed. Do not spread it outwardly and let family members and family members be on guard.
2019年12月31日，武汉市卫健委发布消息表示，到目前为止，调查未发现明显人传人现象，未发现医务人员感染，对病原的检测及感染原因的调查正在进行中。
On December 31, 2019, Wuhan city health committee issued a message said that so far, the investigation has found no obvious human-to-human phenomenon, no infection by medical personnel, the detection of pathogens and the investigation of the causes of infection is under way.
2020年1月1日，武汉市公安局官方微博发布消息称，近日武汉部分医疗机构发现接诊了多例肺炎病例，武汉市卫健委就此发布了情况通报。
On January 1, 2020, the official Weibo of Wuhan Public Security Bureau announced that a number of cases of pneumonia had been found in some medical institutions in Wuhan.
但一些网民在不经核实的情况下，在网络上发布、转发不实信息，造成不良社会影响。
But some netizens in the absence of verification, in the network to publish, forward false information, resulting in adverse social impact.
公安机关经调查核实，已传唤8名违法人员，并依法进行了处理。
After an investigation, the public security organs verified that eight illegal personnel had been summoned and dealt with according to law.
李文亮生前曾回忆，1月3日，他被通知到派出所签下一份训诫书。
Li Wenliang recalled that on January 3, he was told to sign a reprimand at the police station.
训诫书显示，他的违法行为是在互联网上发布不属实言论。
The reprimand showed that his offence was to publish untrue statements on the Internet.
“我当时想着不被拘留已经算好了，直接就签字了。
"I thought I had calculated not to be detained, and signed it directly.
”他说。
'he said.
事后回忆，他仍感到疑惑：“那时我还在想，通报怎么还在说没有人传人，没有医护感染”。
In retrospect, he still wondered: "At the time, I was wondering why the announcement was still saying there was no human-to-human transmission and no medical care for infection."
感染接诊病人未做特殊防护签了字之后，他一直正常工作，接诊病人。
The patient who was admitted to the hospital for infection had been working normally and receiving patients without special protection signatures.
1月8日这天，来了一名82岁的女性患者，急性闭角型青光眼。
On January 8, an 82-year-old woman developed acute angle-closure glaucoma.
彼时，新冠肺炎还是“不明原因的病毒性肺炎”，在武汉市卫健委1月11日的通报中，“未发现明确的人传人证据”。
At that time, the new crown pneumonia or "unknown causes of viral pneumonia," Wuhan City Health Commission reported on January 11, "no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.
李文亮也大意了。
Li Wenliang was also careless.
与平时接触其他患者一样，这次他也没有做特殊防护，这名病人也没有出现发热等症状。
Like other patients, this time he did not have special protection, and the patient did not develop fever and other symptoms.
1月9日，李文亮前一天接诊的这名患者发烧。
On January 9, Li Wenliang received treatment the day before the patient had a fever.
她的CT报告显示，症状是“双肺磨玻璃样病变”。
Her CT report showed that the symptoms were "two lungs grind glass-like lesions."
1月10日，李文亮开始出现咳嗽症状。
On January 10, Li Wenliang began to develop cough symptoms.
1月11日，发热。
January 11, fever.
1月12日，住院，随后住进重症监护室。
On 12 January, he was hospitalized and subsequently admitted to the intensive care unit.
他在住院治疗期间曾回忆，“等她CT做完，我就高度怀疑她是病毒性肺炎”。
During his hospitalization, he recalled, "When she finished her CT scan, I highly suspected she had viral pneumonia."
李文亮分析，这名82岁患者CT显示的症状，是病毒性肺炎的表现，而且已经排除了常见病毒感染的情况。
LiWenLiang analysis, the 82-year-old patient CT symptoms, is a manifestation of viral pneumonia, and has ruled out common viral infections.
“不过，因为医院还没有用于检测确诊病人的试剂盒，当时没有给她确诊”。
"However, she was not diagnosed at the time because the hospital did not have a kit for testing confirmed patients."
1月30日，住在武汉市中心医院重症监护病房的李文亮一直在打针，还是无法自主呼吸、无法活动，要进行高流量吸氧。
On January 30, Li Wenliang, who lives in the intensive care unit of Wuhan Central Hospital, was still unable to breathe and move, and needed high-volume oxygen intake.
此前，李文亮做了一次核酸检测，但一直没出结果。
Li had undergone a nucleic acid test, but had failed to produce results.
经过治疗后又进行一次检测，“我的核酸显示为阴性了”。
After treatment and a second test, "my nucleic acid is negative."
他还是一如既往地乐观：“精神状态好了一些，可以断续用手机打字上网。
Still, he is as sanguine as ever: "He's in better shape and can type on his mobile phone intermittently.
”那时他曾估计自己的病情是，“目前没有生命危险，只是肺功能恢复需要比较长的时间”。
At the time, he estimated that his condition was "not life-threatening at the moment, but it will take a long time for lung function to recover."
家属不能进重症监护室，但医院的同事们帮我买了很多生活用品。
The family couldn't get into the intensive care unit, but my colleagues at the hospital helped me buy a lot of supplies.
病房外的鼓励和支持，让他从病痛中偶有慰藉。
The encouragement and support outside the ward gave him occasional solace from his illness.
此前，他的父母也出现了“肺部磨玻璃样病变”，并住进了医院。
His parents had also developed a "glassy lung lesion" and were hospitalized.
他曾表示，二老“暂时没有生命危险”。
He has said that the elder "temporarily not life-threatening."
“我爱人和孩子目前不在武汉，他们很安全。
"My wife and children are not in Wuhan at present. They are very safe.
”那几天，家人不能照顾身在重症监护室的他，但隔着手机屏每天互相加油鼓励。
For days, his family couldn't take care of him in the intensive-care unit, but cheered each other daily through the cellphone screen.
消逝从确诊到离开只有七天李文亮一直表现得很乐观。
From diagnosis to departure only seven days later Li Wenliang has been behaving optimistically.
“在此我想特别澄清，我没有被吊销执照，请大家放心，我一定积极配合治疗，争取早日出院！”1月31日，他发微博说。
"I would like to make it clear that my license has not been revoked. Please rest assured that I will actively cooperate with the treatment and strive for early discharge," he said on January 31.
此前的两次核酸检测，李文亮都没有被确诊。
The previous two nucleic acid tests, Li Wenliang has not been diagnosed.
2月1日，在重症监护室住了半个多月后，他的核酸检测结果呈阳性。
On 1 February, after more than half a month in the intensive care unit, he tested positive for nucleic acid.
那天他发了条微博，向大家宣布这个消息：“尘埃落定，终于确诊了”。
That day he posted a microblog announcing the news: "The dust settled and the diagnosis was made."
在这条微博底下，他喜爱的电视剧《庆余年》主演张若昀给他留言，“加油，祝您早日康复”。
Beneath the microblog, his favorite TV show "Celebration Years" starring Zhang Ruyun wrote to him, "Come on, I wish you a speedy recovery."
晚上九点多了，躺在重症监护室的他仍然回复了张若昀：“谢谢，期待庆余年2”。
9: 00 pm, lying in the intensive care unit, he still replied Zhang Ruyun: "Thank you, looking forward to celebrating the rest of the year 2."
“对病情我还是比较乐观的。
"I'm optimistic about the condition.
估计还要在床上躺半个月，才能让肺功能大部分恢复。
It is estimated to lie in bed for half a month before most of the lung function is restored.
”他甚至期待着，身体康复后还要上一线——“疫情还在扩散，不想当逃兵！至于疫情以后的事，还没想太多。
He even expects a thin line after his recovery - "The epidemic is spreading and we don't want to be a deserter!
”1月30日，他喘不上气，没有太多力气说话，在手机上发出了这句话。
On January 30, out of breath and with not much energy to speak, he made the remark on his mobile phone.
就像他自己所估计的，所有人一边为他揪着心，一边期盼还不满35岁的他早日康复。
As he himself reckons, everyone clung to his heart, hoping that he would recover before he was 35.
2月6日夜里，关于李文亮的坏消息突然传来，像病房里的消毒水味道一样刺痛着人们的神经。
On the night of February 6, the bad news about Li Wenliang suddenly came, stabbing people's nerves as much as the smell of disinfectant in the ward.
“病危”，“全力抢救中”，“全力抢救无效”。
"Danger", "full rescue in progress," "all efforts to rescue ineffective."
2月7日凌晨，武汉市中心医院宣布了李文亮的死讯。
In the early morning of February 7, Wuhan Central Hospital announced the death of Li Wenliang.
其人正期待新生命降临1月28日，最高法官方微信发布了一篇关于疫情中谣言治理的文章，谈及武汉公安机关处罚8名发布“华南水果海鲜市场确诊7例SARS”的事件。
He is expecting a new life January 28, the Supreme Court issued an article on rumor management in the outbreak, about Wuhan public security organs punished eight people for publishing "South China fruit seafood market confirmed seven cases of SARS.
文章认为，8名信息发布者发布的内容并非完全捏造，主观上并无恶意，考虑到该类谣言在客观上对一定范围群体自我保护意识的提高有一定积极影响，且澄清该类事实较为容易，执法机关对这样的“虚假信息”理应保持宽容态度。
The article considers that the contents published by the eight information publishers are not completely fabricated and are not malicious, and that the law enforcement agencies should be tolerant of such "false information," considering that such rumours objectively have a positive effect on the improvement of self-protection awareness of certain groups and that it is relatively easy to clarify such facts.
但是，这位“吹哨人”走了。
But the whistler went away.
李文亮，1985年10月12日生，辽宁锦州人。

在厦门短暂工作3年后，2014年重返武汉，在武汉市中心医院工作至今。
After working briefly in Xiamen for three years, he returned to Wuhan in 2014 to work in Wuhan Central Hospital.
这个还没满35岁的年轻医师，如果不是因被训诫一事，或许他的名字不会为众人所知，在生活中和普通人也没有太多不同。
The young physician, who was not yet thirty-five years old, might not have known his name if it hadn't been for the admonition.
大学时期的李文亮  。

He likes to shoot cards, whether it's Guangzhou Tower, Bali, work unit or city park. He loves to take pictures and take pictures. He likes to eat delicious food and eat chicken leg after his busy time.
“7228一路走好，xxxx向你致敬！”7228是李文亮的工号，一名正在武汉市中心医院参加抗疫前线工作的医护人员在朋友圈悼念。
7228, the working number of Li Wenliang, a medical worker who was working on the front line of the epidemic in Wuhan city central hospital, mourned in a circle of friends.
“爱乐维好贵啊。
"Elvis is very expensive.
”2019年11月29日，他曾经发了这样一条微博，配图是一种妊娠期和哺乳期妇女补充维生素、矿物质和微量元素的复合维生素片。
On November 29, 2019, he posted a microblog featuring vitamin supplements, minerals, and micronutrients for pregnant and lactating women.
当时34岁的他，有一个完满的家庭，大儿子4岁，妻子怀着小宝宝，全家人正期待着新生命的降临。
At the age of 34, he had a wonderful family, his oldest son was 4, his wife was expecting a baby, and the whole family was looking forward to a new life.
只是他的生命，在这个2月戛然而止。
Only his life came to an abrupt end in February.
