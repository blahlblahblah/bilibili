记者/郭慧敏编辑/杨宝璐宋建华深夜，基辅鲍里斯波尔国际机场外等待通关的物资将83箱捐赠物资“人肉”回国后，张靖塇发现，自己已暂时无法返回乌克兰继续学业。
Reporter / Guo Hui-min editor / Yang Polo Song Jianhua late at night, Kiev Borispol International Airport waiting for customs clearance materials will be 83 boxes of donated "human flesh" back home, Zhang Jing found himself temporarily unable to return to Ukraine to continue his studies.
接到雅安市雨城区人民医院感谢信的一刻，徐依娜没有忍住泪水。
Received Ya'an Yucheng District People's Hospital thank you letter, Xu Yinna did not resist tears.
虽然她购买的口罩只是普通的一次性口罩，无法用在发热门诊，但院方告诉她，这批口罩还是会用在其他临床科室。
Although the mask she bought was an ordinary disposable mask and could not be used in a fever clinic, the hospital told her it would still be used in other clinical departments.
截至2月11日8时，全国新冠肺炎确诊病例已达42407例，疑似病例23589例。
As of 0800 hours on February 11, the number of confirmed cases of New Crown Pneumonia had reached 42,407, with 23,589 suspected cases.
疫情牵动着海外华人的心，海关总署数据显示，1月24日以来，进口捐赠物资达8776.4万件，价值2.86亿元，主要包括口罩7179.9万只、防护服153.3万件、护目镜33.7万副。
Since January 24, the General Administration of Customs has imported 87.764 million pieces of donated goods worth 286 million yuan, including 71.799 million masks, 1.533 million suits of protective clothing and 337,000 pairs of goggles.
在忙碌了105个小时以后，2月1日和2日，两批来自乌克兰华人的捐赠物资分别在北京和三亚落地，并陆续发往各接收单位。
After 105 hours of work, on 1 and 2 February, two groups of donations from Chinese Ukrainians landed in Beijing and Sanya and were distributed to various receiving units.
这批物资经当地华人接力购买、打包、起运，并最终由两名在乌留学生“人肉”带回中国。
The goods were bought, packed, shipped by a local Chinese relay and eventually brought back to China by two foreign students.
报关时遇到了麻烦乌克兰时间2月1日凌晨2:30，基辅鲍里斯波尔国际机场航站楼外，姚杨春秋和同行的37人刚把135箱捐赠物资从车上搬下来，几个穿便衣的海关人员便上前阻拦，称他们的货物堆满了通道，阻碍通行，8分钟之后，身着制服的海关人员也过来询问。
Trouble encountered customs clearance February 1, 2: 30 a.m. Ukraine time, Kiev Borispol International Airport terminal, Yao Yang Chunqiu and 37 people with the same party just moved 135 boxes of donated goods from the vehicle, several customs officers in plain clothes stopped them, claiming that their cargo was full of passageways, blocking the passage, and eight minutes later uniformed customs agents arrived for questioning.
姚杨春秋是在乌克兰读书的中国留学生，得知“漫天飞中乌速运”（以下简称“漫天飞”）义务承运乌克兰华人华侨送往中国的捐赠物资后，报名成了志愿带货人。
Yao Yang Chunqiu, a Chinese student studying in Ukraine, registered as a volunteer consignor after learning that "all over the sky" (hereinafter referred to as "flying all over the sky") volunteers to carry donations of overseas Chinese from Ukraine to China.
叫来帮忙搬运的37人中，有他的同学，还有当地的中国农场主、工人以及捐赠物资的民营企业家。
Among the 37 people called to help with portering were his classmates, local Chinese farmers, workers and private entrepreneurs who donated goods.
这是“漫天飞”承运的第二批物资，包括口罩、防护服、护目镜等。
This is the "flying all over the sky" carrier of the second batch of supplies, including masks, protective clothing, goggles and so on.
一小时以后，物资被搬到航站楼内，但在报关时遇到了麻烦。
An hour later, the goods were moved to the terminal, but there were difficulties in customs clearance.
姚杨春秋回忆，大部分物资是按照进价批量购买——口罩的购买单价是人民币五毛钱，但当时市场价已达到人民币4元一个。
Yao recalled that most of the supplies were purchased in bulk at the purchase price -- a unit price of 50 cents for the mask, but at the time the market price was 4 yuan a yuan.
乌克兰海关在对物资抽检时，核算报关物品价值的标准是市场价，因此他被告知，带货者一个人只能携带18箱物资。
When the Ukrainian customs inspects goods, the criterion for accounting for the value of declared goods is the market price, so he was told that the person carrying the goods can carry only 18 boxes of goods.
上飞机的只有姚杨春秋一人，虽然他随身携带了国内物资接收单位的文件，但仍无法让海关相信这些都是捐赠物资。
Only Yao Yang Chunqiu boarded the plane, and although he carried documents from the domestic material receiving unit with him, he was unable to convince the customs that these were donations.
姚杨春秋猜测，海关阻拦的另一个原因，是现在存在的倒卖行为。
Yao Yang Chunqiu conjecture, another reason that the customs stop, is the existence of the reselling behavior.
“活动负责人黄先生一直在跟海关解释，这是给中国的救灾物资，是大家的无偿捐赠，一直到五点半，海关勉强同意让我带36箱货物，此时距起飞还剩半小时。
"The campaign manager, Mr. Huang, has been explaining to the customs that this is a relief material for China, a donation made free of charge, until 5: 30, when the customs reluctantly agreed to let me take 36 boxes of goods, with half an hour to go.
”姚杨春秋说，这个协商结果出来后，他被空姐带去登机，“当时非常沮丧，觉得如果这么少就失去了意义，因为救不了多少人。
Yao said he was taken aboard by a flight attendant after the negotiations came out. "It was very frustrating to think that if it was so small it would be meaningless, because there were not many people to be saved.
”十分钟之后，事情突然柳暗花明。
Ten minutes later it suddenly became clear.
空姐对姚杨春秋说：“先生，你可能需要再等两小时才能飞。
"You may have to wait another two hours before you can fly, sir," the stewardess told Yao Yang Chunqiu.
”此时，志愿者们的微信群也弹出消息：“嘿，小胖子，今天这些物资可以全部带回去了！”原来，为了让所有物资能上飞机，黄先生联系了中国驻乌克兰大使馆的一位朋友，请他证明135箱物资都是捐赠，并没有任何商业用途，才得以顺利通关，并破例让航班从6点延到了8点40分，可以有时间装货。
At the same time, messages popped up from the volunteers' message groups: "Hey, fat boy, today all the supplies can be taken back!" Mr. Huang contacted a friend of the Chinese Embassy in Ukraine to prove that 135 boxes of goods were donated and had no commercial use for smooth customs clearance, and exceptionally extended the flight from 6 to 8.40 to allow time for loading.
姚杨春秋回忆，这大概是他这辈子最高兴的航班延误了。
Yao Yang Chunqiu recalled that this was probably the happiest flight delay in his life.
最终，由于飞机仓位有限，他带走了70箱。
Eventually, he took 70 boxes with him because of limited space on the plane.
“漫天飞”负责人梁璐璐介绍，这批物资于北京时间2月2日在三亚落地，主要发往浙江温州、瑞安，由浙江省红十字会作为总接收单位。
Liang Lulu, the director of the project, said the shipment landed in Sanya on February 2 in Sanya and was sent to Wenzhou and Ruian in Zhejiang Province, where the Red Cross Society of Zhejiang Province acted as the overall receiver.
志愿者在重新打包捐赠物资临时增加的快运航班梁璐璐告诉深一度记者，从筹集物资，到第二批物资落地，一共花了五天时间。
It took five days for volunteers to repackage their temporarily increased express flights, Liang Lulu, telling reporters that it had taken her five days to raise supplies and land a second.
漫天飞速运是乌克兰的一家华人物流运输公司，由梁璐璐、于凡夫妇2017年成立，目前有员工7人。
Founded in 2017, Liang Lulu, a Chinese logistics transport company based in Ukraine, has seven employees.
乌克兰的国际快递费用高、限制多，“漫天飞”价格便宜，又能承运淘宝快递，因此颇受当地华人欢迎。
Ukraine's high international express costs, restrictions, "flying all over the sky" cheap, but also able to carry Taobao express, so popular with the local Chinese.
梁璐璐和丈夫于凡于1月24日返回北京过年，但迎接他们的，是国内疫情不断严重的消息，同时越来越多在乌华人、团体、企业询问，是否还有前往中国的航班，能不能承运口罩、护目镜等国内急需的防护物资。
Liang and her husband returned to Beijing on January 24 to celebrate the Lunar New Year, but they were greeted by news of a growing outbreak of the disease in China, as well as more and more Chinese people, groups and businesses asking if there were any flights to China and whether they could carry face masks, goggles and other urgently needed protective materials at home.
徐依娜自2011年到乌克兰留学之后就留在当地生活，因为常在淘宝购物，与漫天飞速运熟识。
After studying in Ukraine since 2011, Xu Yinna has been living there because she often goes shopping at Taobao and knows the sky very quickly.
肺炎疫情一冲上微博热搜，她就在购物群里问国内的伙伴们是否需要口罩，同时联系梁璐璐询问航班情况，“当时她说没有，我只能安慰大家不要着急，一旦有航班，马上买了寄过去。
As soon as the outbreak hit Weibo, she asked her domestic partners if they needed masks and asked Liang about her flight. "She said she didn't.
”“我们就觉得应该做点什么，自己只有物流运输方面的资源，那就干呗，给同胞加油！”梁璐璐事后说道。
"We just think we should do something, we only have the resources for logistics and transportation, that's dry," Liang said after the event.
1月28日下午六点半，梁璐璐夫妻二人决定义务承运乌克兰华人捐赠的抗疫物资，梁璐璐特意撰写了一条声明：“在乌克兰的所有同胞你们好，在这个特殊的2020年，漫天飞中乌速运决定在30号临时加一个航班班次，专门用来运输医疗物资，如果有需要捐赠的朋友可以联系我们。
On January 28 at 6: 30 p.m., Liang and her husband decided to take the disease supplies donated by Chinese Ukrainians, Liang Liulu made a special statement: "Hello all compatriots in Ukraine, in this special year 2020, flying all over the sky decided to temporarily add a flight 30, dedicated to the transport of medical supplies, if the need to donate friends can contact us.
”同一天，四川雅安人民医院的工作人员通过微信群找到了徐依娜，告诉她，医院防护物资严重缺乏，现在接受捐赠或购买，询问徐依娜可否帮忙购买并提供发票？徐依娜回复：“可以，但我不要钱。
On the same day, staff of the Ya'an People's Hospital in Sichuan found Xu Yina through a microphone group and told her that there was a severe shortage of protective materials for the hospital.
”当天下午四点多，徐依娜开始在网上搜索口罩生产商，同时电话一个一个打过去问，“当时口罩已经不好买了，只有一家还有货。
"Xu began searching the site for mask makers around 4 p.m., calling one by one to ask," It wasn't a good time to buy a mask, only one had it.
”徐依娜的丈夫开了两个小时车，去厂家取回了口罩，并拿到了厂家的口罩合格证明，送到了漫天飞速运仓库。
"Xu's husband drove for two hours to retrieve the mask and obtained a certificate that it was acceptable for the manufacturer, which sent it to the warehouse quickly.
最终，徐依娜买到了3000个一次性口罩，加上运费，花费234美金，“要是能多买点就好了，对一个医院来说，真是杯水车薪。
Eventually, Ms. Xu bought 3,000 disposable masks, plus freight, at a cost of $234. 'I wish I'd bought more,' she says.
”张靖塇带着第一批物资回国105小时的多人接力梁璐璐回忆，义务承运的消息发出后，大家纷纷响应，用最快的速度连夜将买到的物资送到仓库。
"Zhang Jing took the first batch of supplies to China's 105-hour multi-person relay Liang Lulu recalled, after the news of the voluntary carrier, people responded, using the fastest speed overnight to bring the goods to the warehouse.
1月29日，梁璐璐安排员工在仓库不间断地接收货物。
On January 29, Liang celluloid arranged for her employees to receive the goods in the warehouse without interruption.
虽然事先说明了包装规格，但还是有很多物资需要重新打包，二次打包的任务压在了仓库收货人身上，需要对口罩、防护服进行重新压缩，对小箱物资再次合箱包装。
Although the packaging specifications were specified in advance, there were many items that needed to be repacked, and the task of repacking was placed on the consignee of the warehouse, requiring the re-compression of masks and protective clothing and the repacking of small boxes.
春节放假，公司只留了一名乌克兰员工值班，梁璐璐不得不紧急招募当地华人和朋友来帮忙，消息一发出，当天就有十来个人赶过来，“有钱出钱有力出力，没来得及采购的就出车运货或者打包。
As soon as the news of the holiday, when only one Ukrainian worker was on duty, Liang had to recruit local Chinese and friends to help her, a dozen people rushed in that day.
”于凡回忆，“当时就是拧成一股绳的感觉。
"It was like wrenching together a string," Yu said.
”“当天收到通知，我就派了两辆面包车和两个农场工人赶过去，一直跟着把货送完。
"" I sent two vans and two farm-hands over there at the same day's notice, and I followed them through.
”华人农场主江金锴说，打包、装运、卸车，他们从下午两点一直干到晚上十点，当地饭店老板还给工人送来了宵夜。
The Chinese farmer, Jiang Jinkai, said the men packed, loaded and unloaded the car from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. The local restaurant owner also delivered supper to the workers.
2月1日下午，江金锴接到负责人黄先生的电话，市区的库房满了，还需要临时再找个库房接货。
On the afternoon of February 1, Mr. Huang, the person in charge, telephoned me.
他跟关系不错的当地村长联系，能不能在村里租一个库房，村长回复的很干脆：可以，并且不用花钱，免费提供。
He contacted the good local village chief and asked if he could rent a barn in the village. The village chief replied simply, "Yes, and free of charge."
除了打包和运货，承运任务还缺少一个关键人物——带货人，将所有物资“人肉”带回中国。
In addition to packaging and shipping, the carrier also lacks a key person - the consignor - to bring all the material "human flesh" back to China.
梁璐璐找到了在乌克兰留学的朋友张靖塇。
Liang Lu found Zhang Jing, a friend studying in Ukraine.
“我说没问题。
"I said no problem.
”考虑到疫情严重，回国之后很可能无法返回乌克兰而耽误学业，张靖塇说，一开始他内心有些挣扎，但最终答应了下来。
Given the severity of the outbreak and the likelihood that he would not be able to return to Ukraine and delay his studies, Zhang Jing Yu said he initially struggled but eventually agreed.
于凡在首都机场向海关人员咨询阿拉木图滞留的17小时1月29日，为了让捐赠物资顺利通过海关，梁璐璐、于凡来到北京首都机场询问相关事宜。
Lu Liang and Yu Fan came to the Beijing Capital Airport to inquire about the matter during a 17-hour consultation with customs officials at the capital's airport on January 29 to allow donations to pass through customs.
海关工作人员告诉他们，根据25日的最新文件，只要有国内市级以上接收单位的接收函，捐赠物资可以走绿色通道，不用报关，当场提交符合要求的文件就可以提走物资，之后海关会联系文件上的负责人协助补充报关手续，以及确定物资分配和使用情况。
Customs officials told them that, according to the latest documents of the 25th day, as long as there are letters of acceptance from the receiving units at or above the municipal level in China, the donated materials can go through the Green Channel without customs declaration, and the goods can be collected upon presentation of the required documents on the spot.
与此同时，梁璐璐找到乌克兰海关的朋友，请求其物资在乌克兰出境时给予帮助。
Meanwhile, Lu Liang approached friends at Ukrainian customs and asked for help when her goods left Ukraine.
乌克兰时间1月30日晚六点，张靖塇等人带着83箱物资到达乌克兰基辅鲍里斯波尔机场。
At 6 pm on January 30, Zhang Jing and others arrived at the Borispol airport in Kiev with 83 boxes of supplies.
通过朋友帮忙以及航空公司协调，飞机上的一大半仓位都腾出来让给了捐助物资。
With the help of friends and airline coordination, more than half of the seats on the plane were freed up for donations.
“但第二批物资过海关时，我们没办法再去刷脸找熟人了。
"But when the second consignment went through customs, we couldn't even brush our faces and find acquaintances.
”梁璐璐说。
'said Liang.
相比之下，第一批物资的承运过程相对顺利，只是带货人在转机的时候遇到了麻烦。
By contrast, the first shipment was relatively smooth, although the consignor had trouble connecting flights.
31日凌晨五点左右，张靖塇到达阿拉木图机场转机，一小时之后，海关过来询问：“你是不是姓张？是不是托运了八十多箱口罩？”得到肯定的回答之后，海关将张靖塇带到了办公室，没收了他的手机、护照以及机票，接下来九个小时，双方围绕着物资从哪来、到哪去，干嘛用等问题进行了不间断的沟通。
Zhang Jing arrived at Almaty airport at around 5 a.m., an hour later, customs came to ask: "Are you Zhang? Did you check more than 80 boxes of masks?" After receiving a positive answer, the customs took Zhang Jing to the office and confiscated his cell phone, passport and air ticket.
“他们用手机上的翻译软件问我东西从哪来，我说是乌克兰华人捐献给中国的急救物资，我还拿出随身携带的文件，包括国内接收单位的接收函，但他们只是说这是国际问题，不能让我走。
"They used the translation software on their mobile phones to ask me where things were coming from, I said that the Ukrainian Chinese had donated first aid supplies to China, and I took out the documents I had with me, including the reception letter from the domestic receiving unit, but they just said it was an international problem and could not let me go.
”无奈之下，张靖塇只好跟对方说：“你们想把我送回乌克兰就送，这些运往中国的物资你们想扣就扣，到时候会有中方人员找你们要。
However, Zhang Jing had to tell the other side: "You want to send me back to Ukraine, these goods to China you want to buckle up, and then there will be Chinese people looking for you.
”说完这些话，张靖塇感觉到对方的态度有了改变，让他把拿出来的文件全部读了一遍，随后示意他可以离开了。
"With these words, Zhang Jing felt that the other side's attitude changed, so he read out all the documents, and then hinted that he could leave.
北京时间2月1日凌晨五点，张靖塇带着重1160kg、价值14万元人民币的捐赠物资到达北京首都机场。
At 5 a.m. Beijing time on February 1, Zhang Jing took 1160 kg of donated goods worth 140,000 yuan to the Beijing Capital Airport.
梁璐璐夫妇赶来接机，还叫来一个朋友帮忙搬运。
Liang Lu and his wife came to pick up the plane, but also called a friend to help carry.
4个人把83个箱子从海关里运出，等到哈尔滨相关接收单位的人员搬走其中50箱以后，他们继续把剩下的物资送到市区的顺丰快递点，进行分批邮寄。
Four men took 83 boxes out of the customs and, after 50 boxes had been removed from the relevant receiving units in Harbin, they continued to deliver the remaining materials to Shun Fung Express in the city for batch mail.
徐依娜收到医院的感谢信哭了，被疫情压得难受北京时间2月2日早3:44，姚杨春秋的航班在三亚落地，至此，两批物资承运工作结束。
Yao Yang Chunqiu's flight landed in Sanya at 3: 44 am (Feb. 2), and the two shipments ended when she received a thank-you letter from the hospital.
经过大致核算，包括打包所需物料、员工加班费、带货人机票在内，承运成本一共有六万多元人民币。
After a rough accounting, including packaging requirements for materials, staff overtime, consignor air tickets, the total carrier costs are more than 60,000 yuan.
截至目前，乌克兰还未出现新冠肺炎感染者，但在乌克兰的华人已切实感受到了疫情的影响。
So far, Ukraine has no new cases of pneumonia, but the impact of the epidemic has been felt by Chinese in Ukraine.
梁璐璐称，当地很多中餐馆客流明显减少，华人在大街上打车，有时会被拒载，“有的司机即使让上车，也会开着窗户。
Liang said many Chinese restaurants have seen a marked drop in passenger traffic and that Chinese were sometimes refused permission to take taxis on the streets. "Some drivers leave their windows open even when they get on the bus.
”坐电梯时，当地人看到华人也会躲得远远的。
When taking the lift, the locals saw that the Chinese would stay away as well.
运完物资短暂休息几天后，姚杨春秋返回乌克兰继续上学，返程时，几乎所有前往乌克兰的航班都已取消，他只能先飞香港，再从泰国转到乌克兰，在香港转机时他还差点被拒绝入境，解释了只是短暂中转之后才顺利通过，“当时父亲给我打了五万块钱，说转机七八次也没关系。
After a short rest, Yao Yang returned to Ukraine to continue his education. By the time he returned, almost all flights to Ukraine had been cancelled. He had to fly to Hong Kong from Thailand to Ukraine.
”返程时，飞机上只有姚杨春秋一个中国人，空姐把他前后左右位置上的乘客都调到了其他座位，姚杨春秋有一种被孤立的感觉，“但我能理解。
"Yao Yang Chunqiu was the only Chinese on the plane on the return trip. The flight attendant transferred all the passengers from his front and back positions to other seats.
”张靖塇的学校也马上就要开学，因为没有合适的航班返回乌克兰，也无法回到老家黑龙江大庆，他暂时住在梁璐璐家中。
Zhang Jing's school is also about to start school because there is no suitable flight back to Ukraine or back to his hometown of Daqing in Heilongjiang, where he lives temporarily.
答应做带货人之前，张靖塇已经预想到会是这样的结果，但他还是决定回来送这么一趟，“毕竟国内急需这些东西。
Before he agreed to be the consignor, Zhang Jing had expected such a result, but he decided to come back. "After all, China needs these things badly.
”2月4日，四川雅安人民医院收到了徐依娜寄送的口罩，并给她发来了感谢信，信中写道：“感谢您在这危难关头为雅安市雨城区人民医院捐赠医用口罩3000个用于我院对新冠疫情筛查与治疗工作......在庚子新年之际祝您及家人阖家安康，万事如意！”收到消息的一瞬间，徐依娜哭了。
"Thank you for donating 3000 medical masks to the Yucheng District People's Hospital in Ya'an, Sichuan, on February 4." Thank you for donating 3,000 medical masks to the Yucheng People's Hospital in Ya'an at this critical juncture.
“我本身就是个泪浅的人，被疫情压得难受”。
"I am a shallow tearful person in my own right, oppressed by the epidemic."
她购买的那些口罩只是普通的一次性口罩，无法用在发热门诊，雅安人民医院告诉她，这批口罩将用在其他临床科室。
The masks she bought were ordinary disposable masks that could not be used in a fever clinic, and Ya'an People's Hospital told her they would be used in other clinical departments.
