想要在中国以外的国家建立全产业链几乎不可能，对冲风险的能力十分有限文 | 陈潇潇 编辑 | 谢丽容提要点：1. 今年2月三星在韩国的龟尾工厂有员工感染新型冠状病毒，此后造成新的感染，截至目前龟尾工厂已有六名员工确诊。
It is almost impossible to build a full-scale industrial chain outside China. Chen Xiaoxiao's ability to hedge risks has been limited. 1. Six employees of Samsung's tortoise factory in South Korea have been diagnosed with a new coronavirus since a new coronavirus was infected in February.
为确保疫情不再继续扩散，3月10日，三星宣布龟尾工厂关闭。
To ensure that the epidemic does not spread any further, Samsung declared the turtle factory closed on March 10.
2. 为解决出货问题，三星将希望寄托于其在越南的生产大本营。
Samsung is pinning its hopes on its production base in Vietnam to solve its shipping problems.
但越南的产能状况却比想象中要艰难。
But Vietnam's capacity is tougher than expected.
3. 三星的超千名工程师除了需要在第三国停留14天外，到了本地，还需再进行14天的隔离观察。
3. Samsung's more than 1,000 engineers will be required to stay 14 days in a third country, plus 14 days of isolation.
前后下来，基本上延误接近一个月的工期。
Back and forth, the construction period was largely delayed by nearly one month.
4. 许多供应商在越南的库存只能撑2到4周，包括摄像头在内的关键元器件。
4. Many suppliers have stocks in Viet Nam for only two to four weeks, and key components, including cameras, are available.
5. 2018年多款三星高端旗舰手机进入了全球高端手机销量前十；但到了2019年，入榜的三星手机多是中低端机型。
5. In 2018, Samsung's high-end flagship mobile phones made it into the top 10 in global sales; by 2019, however, most Samsung handsets were in the lower-to-middle range.
三星正面临前所未有的煎熬。
Samsung is facing an unprecedented ordeal.
三星电子披露的2019年度财报显示，2019年三星电子净利润185亿美元，同比下滑51%，营收1956亿美元，同比下滑5.5%，创2016年以来的最低值。
Samsung Electronics reported a 2019 profit of $18.5 billion, down 51% from a year earlier, and revenue of $195.6 billion, down 5.5% year-on-year, the lowest since 2016.
其中三星移动业务利润同比下降了8.3%。
Samsung Mobile's profit fell 8.3% YoY.
为提振业绩，三星在财报中表示，2020年将发布多款高端旗舰机，同时加强5G阵容，提高中低端手机的竞争力。
To boost earnings, Samsung said in its earnings report that it would release a number of high-end flagship aircraft in 2020, while strengthening its 5G lineup to improve the competitiveness of low- and mid-range handsets.
但现在疫情打乱了生产计划。
But now the outbreak has disrupted production plans.
据《财经》记者了解，由于疫情泛滥，三星位于中国及东南亚的生产基地皆受到不同程度的影响。
Because of the epidemic, Samsung's production base in China and Southeast Asia has been affected to varying degrees, according to Caijing.
压力之下，三星已经开始砍单。
Under pressure, Samsung has already begun to chop.
智能终端研发设计公司（ODM）华勤的一位销售人士对《财经》记者表示，三星已经砍掉华勤部分的订单。
Samsung has already cut orders for Huaqin, a salesperson at Smart Terminal R & D Design (ODM), told Caijing.
原因很简单：截止目前，华勤国内工厂的产能仅恢复到50%。
The reason is simple: So far, the company has been able to restore only 50% of its domestic plant capacity.
去年11月，三星关闭了位于中国惠州的最后一家手机制造工厂。
Last November, Samsung closed its last cellphone-making plant in Huizhou, China.
此后，三星将20%的出货量外包给了中国ODM巨头闻泰和华勤，后者为三星生产成本均价在60美金左右的中低端系列手机。
Samsung has since outsourced 20 per cent of its shipments to China's ODM giant ODM, which runs a range of low- and mid-range phones costing about $60 a share of Samsung's production costs.
为三星制造高端手机的韩国龟尾工厂也处于停产状态。
South Korea's tortoise tail factory, which makes high-end phones for Samsung, is also out of production.
该工厂原本计划生产今年主打的高端旗舰折叠手机Galaxy Z Flip以及Galaxy S20。
The factory had planned to produce this year's flagship flagship Galaxy Z Flip and Galaxy S20.
今年2月该工厂有员工感染新型冠状病毒，此后在工厂内部造成新的感染，截至目前龟尾工厂已有六名员工确诊。
The factory's employees were infected with the new coronavirus in February and have since caused new infections inside the plant, which has been confirmed by six employees so far.
为确保疫情不再继续扩散，3月10日，三星宣布龟尾工厂关闭。
To ensure that the epidemic does not spread any further, Samsung declared the turtle factory closed on March 10.
突如其来的生产变化，无疑雪上加霜。
Sudden changes in production, no doubt added insult to injury.
为解决出货问题，三星将希望寄托于其在越南的生产大本营。
To solve its shipping problems, Samsung is pinning its hopes on its production base in Vietnam.
但越南的产能状况却比想象中要艰难。
But Vietnam's capacity is tougher than expected.
超千名工程师难进越南，物料跟不上三星已试图将龟尾及中国代工厂的部分订单转移至越南生产。
More than a thousand engineers have been unable to get into Vietnam, and the company has tried to move some orders from Turtle's tail and Chinese factories to Vietnam.
越南是目前三星在全球最大的制造基地，生产超过一半的三星手机。
Vietnam is now Samsung's largest manufacturing base in the world, producing more than half of Samsung's phones.
前述华勤人士对《财经》记者表示，代工厂已按照三星的要求将所需零部件和半成品发往越南。
The factory has shipped parts and semi-finished goods to Vietnam as required by Samsung, the company told Caijing.
但据《财经》记者了解，按照目前越南的生产条件，三星想要在短期内完成更多订单，挑战很大。
However, according to Caijing reporter, according to the current production conditions in Vietnam, Samsung wants to complete more orders in the short term, a big challenge.
这并不是三星的个性问题，是整个越南制造业的问题。
It's not just Samsung's personality, it's the entire Vietnamese manufacturing industry.
越南工业和贸易部在一份声明中表示，汽车、电子产品和手机制造商在获取供应和材料方面遇到了困难。
The Vietnamese Ministry of Industry and Trade said in a statement that manufacturers of automobiles, electronics and mobile phones were encountering difficulties in obtaining supplies and materials.
一位接近三星的供应链人士告诉《财经》记者，新增订单需求要求新增产线和工程师，需接近1000个工程师从韩国来越南本地支援。
A supply chain source close to Samsung told Caijing that new orders would require new production lines and engineers, and close to 1,000 engineers would need to come from South Korea to help in Vietnam.
但自3月韩国疫情升级后，越南政府突然加强了对韩国的出入境管制政策。
But since March, when the South Korean epidemic escalated, Vietnam's government suddenly tightened immigration controls on South Korea.
这些工程师除了需要在第三国停留14天外，到了本地，还需再进行14天的隔离观察。
In addition to being required to stay in a third country for 14 days, these engineers are required to travel to the local area for a further 14 days of isolation observation.
前后下来，基本上延误接近一个月的工期。
Back and forth, the construction period was largely delayed by nearly one month.
另一方面，疫情已导致中越的进出口物流严重受阻。
On the other hand, the epidemic has seriously hampered China-Vietnam import and export logistics.
春节过后，中越最大贸易关口友谊关以及二级口岸先后关闭。
After the Spring Festival, the Sino-Vietnamese largest trade border friendly customs and secondary ports have been closed.
虽然目前以每日限流的方式逐渐恢复，由于此前的一个月内堆积了太多货物，导致运输拥挤，交付效率很低。
Although it is being gradually restored through daily flow restrictions, the accumulation of too much cargo during the previous month has led to congestion and inefficient delivery.
许多供应商在越南的库存只能撑2到4周。
Many suppliers have only two to four weeks in stock in Viet Nam.
这其中包括摄像头在内的关键元器件。
This includes key components such as cameras.
一位供应链人士对《财经》记者表示，舜宇光学本是三星的摄像头模组供应商，由于国内复工率仅为30%，三星无奈之下已经开始更换供应商。
A supply chain source told Caijing that Samsung Optics, the company's camera module supplier, had begun changing suppliers because of a domestic restart rate of only 30 per cent.
尽管越南当地有上万家三星的供应商，但30%的材料依然要从中国进口。
Although Vietnam has tens of thousands of Samsung suppliers locally, 30% of the material still needs to be imported from China.
就算手机可以完成组装，但由于缺少插头、线缆，甚至包装盒上的打印标签，都无法顺利出货。
Even if the phone can be assembled, the lack of plugs, cables, and even printing labels on the boxes makes it difficult to ship.
据《财经》记者了解，包括蓝思、伯恩在内的越南本地配套工厂都因原材料供给问题，产能来不及恢复正常。
According to Caijing reporter, including Lanse, Bourne and other local ancillary factories in Vietnam because of raw materials supply problems, capacity will not be restored to normal.
“就算订单都转过来，越南这边也消化不了。
"Even if the orders were turned around, Vietnam would not be able to digest them.
”一位三星在越南本地的二级供应商对《财经》表示，他为三星手机提供包材和印刷服务。
A local Samsung secondary supplier in Vietnam told Caijing that he provides packaging and printing services for Samsung's phones.
跟许多本地供应商一样，受产能影响，三星目前下发的订单并没有增加，且数量随时都在变动。
Like many local suppliers, Samsung's current orders have not increased due to capacity, and the number is constantly changing.
他预计第一季度订单会比原计划损失三分之一。
He expects orders to lose a third of their original plan in the first quarter.
生产转移容易，供应链转移难根据市场调研机构counterpoint数据，2019年三星手机以2.96亿台的销量位居全球第一，紧随其后的是华为，出货量约2.4亿台，苹果手机出货量1.9亿台，排名第三。
With 296 million units sold, Samsung topped the world in 2019, followed by Huawei, which shipped 240 million units, and Apple Inc., which shipped 190 million units, ranking third, according to market research firm Countrypoint.
尽管手机销售量多年蝉联第一，但财报显示，2019年三星移动业务利润同比下降了8.3%。
Despite years of top mobile sales, Samsung Mobile's profit fell 8.3% in 2019, compared with a year earlier.
利润下滑的原因不难理解。
The reasons for the decline are understandable.
2019年三星用于营销和推广的费用支出增长了5%，达到了4500万美金左右，但为公司带来核心利润的高端旗舰机销量却表现乏力。
Samsung's spending on marketing and promotion rose 5% to about $45 million in 2019, but sales of high-end flagship aircraft, which generate the company's core profits, have lagged behind.
据市场调研机构counterpoint数据，2018年包括Galaxy S9、GalaxyS9 plus等多款三星高端旗舰手机进入了全球高端手机销量前十。
According to market researcher countrypoint data, 2018 includes Galaxy S9, Galaxy S9 plus and other high-end flagship mobile phones into the world's top 10 mobile phone sales.
但到了2019年，入榜的三星手机分别是Galaxy A50、Galaxy A20和Galaxy A10，都是中低端机型。
By 2019, however, the three-star handsets on the list were Galaxy A50, Galaxy A20 and Galaxy A10, all of which are mid- and low-end models.
事实上，2019年三星推出了六款Galaxy高端旗舰机，包括S系列四款，Note系列一款，以及全新的折叠屏产品线，但没有一款入榜。
In fact, Samsung launched six high-end flagship Galaxy aircraft in 2019, including the S-Series Four, Note Series, and a new folded screen line, but none of them made it to the list.
相较之下，苹果的iPhone 11 及iPhone 11 pro都进入了销量单品前十。
Apple's iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 pro, by contrast, are in the top 10.
为了优化利润结构，过去几年三星一直在加速制造基地的转移，以进一步降低生产成本。
To optimize its profit structure, Samsung has been accelerating the relocation of its manufacturing base over the past few years to further reduce production costs.
自2009年起，三星已在越南设下8个工厂和一家研发中心，总投资超过173亿美元，占越南出口总值的五分之一。
Since 2009, Samsung has set up eight factories and a research and development centre in Vietnam, with a total investment of more than $17.3 billion, or one-fifth of Vietnam's total exports.
财报显示，2018年越南为三星加工的电子销售额高达657亿美元，约占三星全球电子销售额的30%。
In 2018, Samsung's electronic sales totaled $65.7 billion, or about 30% of Samsung's global electronics sales, according to the results.
去年10月三星关闭在中国所有的手机组装工厂后，又进一步将产能转移至越南，尤其是高端手机组装部分。
After shutting down all its handset assembly plants in China last October, Samsung moved further into Vietnam, especially in the high-end assembly segment.
不过转移生产容易，转移供应链却很难。
But shifting production is easy, transferring supply chains is difficult.
这是因为手机产业链太长，想要在中国以外的国家建立全产业链几乎不可能。
This is because the mobile phone industry chain is too long, it is almost impossible to establish the entire industrial chain outside China.
这意味着即使能节省成本，对冲风险的能力也十分有限。
This means that even if there are cost savings, the ability to hedge risks is limited.
据《财经》记者了解，越南本地60%以上的供应链企业服务于三星，但完成的基本都是粗加工部分。
According to Caijing reporter, more than 60% of Vietnam's local supply chain enterprises serve Samsung, but basically complete the rough processing part.
歌尔、瑞声科技都是三星的核心供应商。
Goyle, Raytheon Technology are Samsung's core suppliers.
2012年起，三星要求这些一级供应商必须在越南当地设厂，以保证能够快速反应。
Starting in 2012, Samsung required these first-tier suppliers to establish local plants in Viet Nam to ensure rapid response.
但电子产品的供应链是一个网状结构，一级供应商下面还有二级供应商以及诸多的配套环节。
But the supply chain of electronic products is a network structure, there are secondary suppliers and many supporting links.
歌尔的当地负责人对《财经》表示，80%以上的材料都靠进口，越南本地只完成组装工作。
Gore's local director told Caijing that more than 80 per cent of the material was imported and only local assembly was done in Vietnam.
这是因为越往供应链的前端走，就越难转移，尤其是零部件。
This is because moving closer to the front end of the supply chain makes it harder to move, especially parts.
据《财经》记者了解，去年十月，三星关闭其惠州工厂后，将与之配套的一家韩国螺丝厂转移至了越南。
According to Caijing reporter, Samsung closed its Huizhou factory last October and transferred a South Korean screw factory with it to Vietnam.
但这家螺丝厂的其余中国配套厂商却很难一起转移，因为所需的塑胶、钢材等原材料越南当地均无法生产。
But it is difficult for the rest of the Chinese manufacturers to move along, because the needed plastic, steel and other raw materials cannot be produced locally in Vietnam.
这样一算，物流运输加之在越南当地设厂的费用，成本和风险都非常高。
The costs, costs and risks of logistics transport combined with local plant establishment in Viet Nam are very high.
不过，由于中美贸易摩擦的影响，过去一年以来，这些前端供应链企业也开始加速往海外转移。
But these front-end supply chain companies have also begun to move overseas at an accelerated pace over the past year as a result of trade frictions between China and the US.
综合多家供应链企业的观察，对于巨头而言，未来最安全的方式，是在多个国家分别做供应链的布局。
Synthesize the observation of many supply chain enterprises, for the giant, the safest way in the future is to do supply chain layout in several countries.
