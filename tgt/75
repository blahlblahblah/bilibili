2019年3月，武汉协和医院急诊科副主任孙鹏调到该医院的西院，负责急诊科的工作。
In March 2019, Sun Peng, deputy director of emergency department of Wuhan Hsiao Wo Hospital, was transferred to the western courtyard of the hospital to take charge of the emergency department.
12月底华南海鲜市场冠状病毒事发，西院开设发热门诊，这两个门诊的工作都落到他头上。
At the end of December, the South China seafood market coronavirus incident, the Western Hospital opened a fever clinic, these two outpatient work fell on his head.
今年1月26日上午，孙鹏告诉记者，医院刚接到通知，他们西院也被征为定点医院，成为武汉市第三批可以收治诊断为新型冠状病毒肺炎病人的医院之一。
On the morning of January 26, Sun Peng told reporters that the hospital had just been notified that its western hospital had also been called a designated hospital, becoming one of the third batch of hospitals in Wuhan that can admit patients diagnosed with the new coronavirus pneumonia.
以下是孙鹏口述。
The following is Sun Peng's oral testimony.
口述 | 孙鹏记者 | 驳静最疲惫的一个除夕10天前，我从家里收拾了点衣服，住到了我租在医院附近的房子里，开始自我隔离。
AT RATE SUNG & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & #
除夕晚9点钟，我刚到住处，想说过年嘛，一个人也煮点饺子。
New Year's Eve evening at 9 o'clock, I just arrived at the residence, would like to say New Year's Eve, a person also cooked dumplings.
刚吃完，又赶往医院，因为有个病人情况突然恶化。
After eating, he rushed to the hospital because one of the patients' condition suddenly deteriorated.
这位病人早上刚确诊新型冠状病毒肺炎，还没来得及送去定点收治医院。
The patient had just been diagnosed with new coronavirus pneumonia in the morning and had not yet been taken to a designated hospital.
上午我还问他感觉怎么样，他说“蛮好”，整个白天其实都还不错，哪知到了晚上又急转直下。
In the morning I also asked him how he felt, he said "very good," the whole day is actually good, but I did not know the night and then suddenly turned down.
我们抢救了一个多小时，戴着防护面罩、口罩，穿着防护服的我们，其实心里清楚，如此近距离实施抢救，感染机率又增加不少，可这种时候医生不可能退缩，也不会退缩的。
We saved over an hour, wearing face shield, mask, wearing protective clothing, in fact, the heart of such close rescue, the probability of infection increased a lot, but this time the doctor can not shrink, will not shrink.
我心里希望奇迹发生，但这位病人的基础状态并不好，老年人常见的心脏和血压问题都有，感染肺炎对他来说就是一个严重打击。
I was hoping for a miracle, but the patient was not in a good basic condition. He had heart and blood pressure problems common in the elderly.
实际上，目前我们医院的死亡病例也以年老的、有基础疾病的患者居多。
In fact, the number of deaths in our hospitals today is also higher among the elderly and those with basic diseases.
那晚他的病情发展非常快，其实之前还有过一次抢救，那回成功了，这第二次，很遗憾没有。
That night his illness developed very fast, in fact, there was a rescue, that successful, this second time, I am sorry not.
我们亲手把他放到停尸袋里，再将其送入殡葬车。
We put him in the mortuary bag and put him in the mortuary car.
这要是平常，病人宣布死亡后，剩下的事其实是家属和殡仪馆的，但在这种特殊时期，家属有恐慌心理，这工作几乎是我们医护人员做的。
The rest of what happens when the patient is declared dead is actually family and funeral homes, but at this particular time there is a sense of panic among the family, and the work is almost done by our paramedics.
这天晚上还有一例死亡，也是一位年纪很大的患者，长期卧床不起，后来家属决定不进行积极插管治疗，也在这天晚上自然地走掉了。
There was also a death that evening of a very old patient who had been bedridden for a long time and whose family had decided not to undergo active intubation, and who had naturally left that evening.
这一切结束，已经是凌晨，我从医院出来，开车回家。
It was early in the morning and I got out of the hospital and drove home.
可能因为天黑，可能因为公共交通都没了，可能因为我眼镜上有雾气，总之路上一辆车都没看到。
Maybe it was dark, maybe because the public transportation was gone, maybe because I had fog on my glasses, but I didn't see a car on the way.
独自驾驶在这样的路上，头脑里就在过刚才的一些画面。
Driving alone on such a road, the mind is just passing a few pictures.
武汉一直下雨，又冷又湿，我站在病房中间，旁边放着两具尸体，同事从身边走过，都穿着防护服，我也穿着防护服，戴着护目镜，护目镜里还有我的眼镜，每天都雾蒙蒙的，还有病人排队，耳边听到家属在门外哭泣。
Wuhan has been raining, cold and wet, I stood in the middle of the ward, next to two bodies, colleagues passing by wearing protective clothing, I also wear protective clothing, goggles, goggles, every day fog, patients queuing, heard the family crying outside the door.
后来我发了条消息到同事群里，“抢救了一晚上，最后以两具尸体收场，真是疲惫”。
Then I sent a message to my colleagues, "rescue the night, and finally end up with two bodies, really tired."
我从业20余年，除夕夜在急诊科度过也是常事。
I have more than 20 years of practice, New Year's Eve spent in the emergency department is also common.
但从前年三十的病房，多少还有过年气氛，昨晚是真没有。
But in the past 30 wards, more or less there is a New Year atmosphere, last night is really not.
抢救完病人，我只有全身心的疲惫。
After rescuing the patient, I only have the exhaustion of the whole body.
这种无能为力的感觉不好受，今年的最后一天，真是难过得很。
The feeling of helplessness, the last day of the year, really sad.
作者：张学彦《向医护人员致敬》这一个月来，我时时提着一颗心，最担心的就是同事们中招。
Author: Zhang Xuehiyan, "Salute to the Medical Personnel" In the past month, I have been carrying a heart, the most worried is the colleagues to move.
前几天我们科室的陈丹丹医生下夜班后告诉我，说自己发烧了，我当时心里就是“咯噔”一下，而且我也能感觉她也很紧张，下夜班后正是人最虚弱的时候，我就赶紧安排她去做检查，心里祈祷她只是普通的受凉感冒。
The other day when Dr. Chen Dandan of our department started working the night shift and told me that I had a fever, I thought I thought I thought I thought I thought I thought, and I thought she was too nervous.
这位年轻的女医生，回去只休息了一天，就给我发信息说，“主任，如果晚上不再发烧，明天的班我自己上吧，免得其他同事顶我的班，又把他们累倒了”。
The young woman doctor, after only a day's rest, sent me a message saying, "If there is no fever at night, sir, I will go to work tomorrow so that my colleagues will not overwhelm them."
看到这种话真是鼻子发酸。
It was a sore nose to see such a remark.
所幸后来她冠状病毒核酸检测结果是阴性。
Fortunately, she later tested negative for coronavirus nucleic acid.
我给急救车安排了3位医生，跑24小时，休息2天，三班倒。
I assigned three doctors to the ambulance for 24 hours, two days off and three shifts.
讲实话这个岗位很难做，因为他们现在主要承担着运送确诊病人的职责。
The job of telling the truth is difficult because they are now primarily responsible for the transportation of diagnosed patients.
路途短则一个小时，长则超过两个小时，在密闭空间，与重症患者近距离相处，有些还上着呼吸机。
The journey ranged from one hour to more than two hours, in enclosed spaces, close to patients with severe illnesses, some with breathing machines.
他们的隔离服不透气，车厢里又闷，跑一次内衣就湿透一次，回来后给车子消毒，换一身衣服，再送下一个，最晚的一次送到凌晨四五点才结束。
Their isolation suits were airtight and stuffy in the compartment. They were drenched once in a run, disinfected their cars, changed their clothes, and sent the next one, at the latest, at four or five in the morning.
你说他们心理压力有多大？但没人跟我诉过苦。
How much psychological pressure do you say they have? But no one ever told me about it.
发热门诊有轮休，再过几天，会有一批同事顶替我们，只求撤下来的时候，大家能一起平平安安地撤退。
The fever clinic has the rotation break, in a few days, will have a group of colleagues to replace us, only to withdraw when the time, we can together safely retreat.
希望冬天早点过去我们西院发热门诊的留观床位是20张，当时没想到会有这么多病人。
I hope we can get there early in the winter. The number of beds in our hospital was 20.
我记得12月底，最开始的时候我们只接待了一两位华南海鲜市场的病人。
I remember at the end of December, at the beginning, we received only one or two patients from the South China Seafood Market.
一开始说“没有人传人”，后来判断变了，说“有限人传人”。
At the beginning, it was said that "no one passed from person to person," but later the judgment changed.
接诊病人到达100多位的时候，我在心里打了个记号，这几天又涨到300多。
Receive the patient to arrive at more than 100, I make a mark in the heart, this a few days rise to 300 more.
这里面有跨区来看诊的，因为我们西院在汉阳区，是个经济开发区，中心城区人太多，有些患者宁可跑远一点，跨区来看诊；还有患者是来复诊的，这样一来，看诊人数就是滚雪球，越滚越大。
Some patients prefer to go a little further and come to the clinic across districts. In this way, the number of patients attending the clinic is snowballing and getting bigger.
人越来越多，与此形成对比的是，病人们的情绪反而比往常稳定。
In contrast to the growing number of people, patients are now in a more stable mood than usual.
我们护士也在说，往常就医，有时候排队排久了，还会有病人发脾气，跟医护人员吵吵闹闹，这段时间反而平静很多。
Our nurses also said that it was a much calmer time to seek medical attention, sometimes long queues, angry patients, and rowdy medical staff.
我觉得原因有三个：一是大家逐渐对这个病有认知了；二是多少听到看到周围朋友亲戚的案例，心里有预期；第三，这个病对年老患者更易造成危害，很多年轻患者感染后能走能动，不受限制，跟卧床不起感觉还是两样。
I think there are three reasons for this: first, people are becoming more aware of the disease; second, they are more or less aware of the cases of friends and relatives around them, and thirdly, the disease is more harmful to the elderly.
有一个三四十岁的男士让我感触很深。
I was impressed by a man in his thirties and forties.
他带着父亲来看病，他父亲当时只是有点胸闷，稍微有点喘，有点发烧，可我一看CT片子，是个“大白肺”。
He brought his father to the doctor, who had a little chest tightness, a little wheezing and a fever, but I looked at the CT picture and it was a "big white lung."
我告诉他说病情“不容乐观”，但他觉得他父亲能走能说话，头脑也清楚，我可能在夸大其辞。
I told him the condition was "not very good," but he thought his father could walk and talk, his head was clear, and I might be exaggerating.
当时还是1月初，接着病情就加重了，在我们这里做了气管插管，又转到呼吸科重症病房。
It was early January, and then it got worse. We had a trachea intubation here and we were transferred to the respiratory intensive care unit.
就在转病房的走廊上，我看他一声不吭的。
In the hallway of the transfer room, I could see he was silent.
他父亲后来没能扛下来。
His father couldn't carry it.
隔了一周，我看到他又来了，这回是自己来看诊。
After a week, I saw him come again, this time to see for himself.
我看他的片子，两个肺一起感染了，然后他妹妹也来了，同样是双肺感染。
I saw his movie, two lungs got infected, and then his sister came, too, with a two-lung infection.
你看，他们一家感染了3个。
You see, their family is infected with three.
我接到的第二个确诊为新型冠状病毒肺炎的病人，是海鲜酒店的采购人员，基本每天都会去华南海鲜市场。
I received the second case of the new coronavirus pneumonia, a seafood hotel procurement staff, will basically go to the South China seafood market every day.
我印象很深，我们的负压救护车要把他转去金银潭医院时，他爱人挺高兴，跑来道谢，还说“等病情好转，要带几只土鸡子”。
I was so impressed that when our ambulance tried to transfer him to the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital, his wife was delighted and thanked him and said, "When it gets better, bring some turkeys."
一个星期后，发热门诊又碰到了她了，只是咳嗽，没有发热，但肺部CT显示也是病毒肺，很可能就是照顾病人时受到的感染，后来她给转去金银潭医院了。
A week later, the fever clinic ran into her again, coughing and no fever, but the pulmonary CT also showed signs of viral lung infection, most likely the infection she had while taking care of the patient, before she was transferred to the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital.
当时心情真是沉重。
It was a heavy mood.
陌生人为孙鹏所在的医院送去的外卖，备注写着：外卖小哥，麻烦您送给医院的医生或护士们，麻烦了，您也注意穿戴防护口罩，辛苦了！我今天又看到一个病人家属。
Note: Take-out brother, please give it to the doctors or nurses in the hospital, trouble, you also pay attention to wearing a face mask, hard! I saw a patient's family today.
她老伴是我接到的第三个不明肺炎患者。
Her wife was the third case of unexplained pneumonia I received.
这位患者只是参加了一个老年聚会，并没有去过华南海鲜市场。
The patient had only attended an elderly party and had not been to the South China seafood market.
后来他恢复得挺好，一晃半个月过去，我又在医院看见他老伴儿了，她看到我说，“谢谢你。
"Then he recovered quite well, and half a month later I saw his wife at the hospital again. She looked at me and said," Thank you.
我老伴儿好了，我又得了”。
Well, my wife, I've got it again.
我们就发现，我们把一个病人收到病房，好不容易出院了，照顾他的这些家属，过了潜伏期，又出问题了。
We found out that we took a patient to the ward, got out of the hospital with difficulty, took care of his family, passed the incubation period, and went wrong again.
接触到的家庭聚集性病人越来越多，我就觉得事态严重，跟其它医院的同行交流，他们也有同感，陆续地我们医护人员就开始自我隔离了。
As more and more families gathered around sexually transmitted diseases, I felt that push came to shove. As I spoke to my colleagues at other hospitals, they shared my feelings, and our paramedics began to isolate themselves.
我在担心我14岁的女儿。
I'm worried about my 14-year-old daughter.
我爱人在武汉协和医院本部，是一名麻醉科医生。
My wife is a anesthesiologist at the headquarters of Wuhan Concord Hospital.
现在医院大都是取消休假，全员进入排班系统，前两天她跟我说，马上就轮到她们上一线了。
Hospitals are now mostly canceled leave, full into the shift system, two days ago she told me that their turn soon on the line.
这样一来，她也得隔离，家里就剩孩子一人，学校延迟开学，很现实的问题是吃饭怎么办。
In this way, she also had to isolate, the family left a child, the school delayed the start of school, the very real question is how to eat.
感觉上是，哦，挑战还在后面。
It feels like, oh, the challenge is still ahead.
前几天女儿给我写了封信，还是文言文的文体，信里她表达关心，“流感突起，肺炎逼至，想父亲安康”。
A few days ago my daughter wrote me a letter, or the style of classical Chinese, in which she expressed concern, "flu bulge, pneumonia forced, miss his well-being."
又反省自己，说她怪我“常早出晚归，于我偶有失信”，意思是以后会更体谅她爸爸，不会再“怪罪于我”。
Reflecting on her own, she blamed me for "coming out early and coming home late," meaning that she would be more considerate of her father and no longer "blame me."
这让我大吃一惊，想不到孩子能写出这样的东西，我突然意识到，没见女儿这一个多礼拜，真是长大了，所以我安慰我爱人说，孩子总要长大的，不如趁这时候。
Then I realized that I had grown up without seeing my daughter for more than a week, so I comforted my wife by telling her that it was better to grow up.
女儿的信信里还有一句，“吾坚信没有一个冬日不可逾越，病毒肆虐的当下，亦如是”。
My daughter's letter also said, "I firmly believe that no winter can be insurmountable, the virus rages in the present, so."
我常在心里琢磨这句话，“没有一个冬日不可逾越”，说得多好。
I often thought in my mind, "No winter is insurmountable", how well said.
在这种非常时期，我看到很多病人在我们留观病房治好，非常高兴地回家，可无法松口气，因为病人不断出现。
In these unusual times, I saw a lot of patients in our ward, very happy to go home, but can not relax, because patients continue to appear.
再看到我的同事有倒下的、送去治疗的，压力、担忧和恐惧，我都有。
I have all the stress, the worry and the fear of seeing my co-workers fall and go to therapy.
常在河边走，哪有不湿鞋，天天泡在这里，没准哪一天你一时疏忽，自己就中招了。
Often walk in the river, where there are not wet shoes, every day soak here, perhaps one day you neglect, on their own admission.
但对我们这个队伍来说，没有退路，你只能向前，只能每次上班盯着自己，小心再小心。
But for our team, there is no escape route, you can only move forward, can only stare at themselves every time work, careful and careful.
我希望冬天早点过去，“逾越”那天早日到来。
I hope the winter will be over early and the "beyond" day will come soon.
