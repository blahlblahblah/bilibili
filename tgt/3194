”2月底，在全球多国相继出现新冠肺炎疫情且确诊病例不断增加的同时，与中国相邻的越南显得尤为平静，此前已经连续22天没有新增病例。
At the end of February, amid a surge in new cases of pneumonia in many countries around the world, Vietnam, bordering China, was particularly calm after 22 days of no new cases.
就在人们的生活逐步恢复正常的时候，一架从英国伦敦飞往越南首都河内的飞机打破了这份平静。
Just as people's lives were gradually returning to normal, a plane from London to Hanoi broke the calm.
3月6日，越南通报确诊第17例新冠肺炎病例，这是继2月25日越南第16例——也是此前最后一例病例治愈出院后首次出现新增确诊，结束了10天的“零病例”状态。
On March 6, Vietnam reported the first confirmed case of New Crown Pneumonia, the 16th case in Vietnam on Feb. 25 - the first new diagnosis since the last case was cured and discharged, ending a 10-day "zero cases" status.

家住越南的居民刘先生告诉界面新闻，在通报第17例病例的第二天，各超市都出现了抢购情况，他在网上订购的食品均未发货，“只收到一封库存不足的道歉信”。
Mr. Liu, a resident of Vietnam, told the Interface News that the day after the announcement of the 17th case, supermarkets were snapping up food he had ordered online and "only one letter of apology was received from insufficient stocks."
越南副总理武德詹表示，第17例的出现意味着越南进入防控疫情的第二阶段，由于疫情已蔓延至全球超过100个国家，这个阶段将比之前更加艰难。
Vietnam's deputy prime minister, Vudjan Vuitjan, said the emergence of the 17th case means Vietnam is entering the second phase of prevention and control, which will be more difficult now that the epidemic has spread to more than 100 countries worldwide.
第17例病例是一名来从英国返回的26岁女性越南游客，她乘坐越南航空VN0054次航班商务舱于3月2日抵达河内内排机场，随后返回河内家中。
The seventeenth case, a 26-year-old Vietnamese tourist returning from the United Kingdom, arrived at Hanoi on 2 March on VN0054 commercial flight VN0054 before returning to her home in Hanoi.
3月5日，她因高烧不退、咳嗽、乏力前往医院就医，随后被确诊感染新冠肺炎。
On 5 March, she went to the hospital with a high fever, cough and weakness, and was subsequently diagnosed with pneumonia.
这位患者在2月15日从河内飞往伦敦，先后在2月18日和25日前往疫情较重的意大利米兰和法国巴黎旅游，并在29日开始出现咳嗽和乏力症状，但当时没有发烧。
The patient flew from Hanoi to London on February 15 and travelled to Milan, Italy, and Paris, France, where the epidemic was severe on February 18 and 25. He developed cough and fatigue symptoms on Feb. 29, but did not have a fever.
患者在没有就医的情况下登上了返回越南的客机，并在入境时隐瞒了身体不适状况。

目前她已被转至中央热带疾病医院东英县分院的负压隔离病房接受治疗。

随后两天里，越南又新增13人确诊感染新冠病毒，其中10人是VN0054次航班的乘客，年龄在58至74岁，有9人乘坐商务舱，1人乘坐经济舱；另有2名越南人是第17例病例的密切接触者。
In the following two days, an additional 13 people were diagnosed with the new crown virus in Viet Nam, 10 of whom were passengers on flight VN0054, aged 58 to 74, 9 travelling in business class and 1 in economy class; and 2 Vietnamese were in close contact with the seventeenth case.

Following the diagnosis of the 17th case, the Hanoi government also took prompt preventive and control measures, starting from a section of streets about 500 metres long where the cases were blocked on the night of June 6.

In addition to breaking the 17th case of "zero cases," the 18-year-old Vietnamese, who returned home from Taegu, South Korea, on Thursday and was quarantined immediately after entering the country.
法国广播电台（RFI）指出，韩国疫情爆发对越南来说也是一个潜在威胁。
Radio France (RFI) notes that the South Korean outbreak is also a potential threat to Vietnam.
两国商贸往来频繁，有近4.8万越南人在韩国工作，其中有4000人在韩国疫情中心的大邱市和庆北地区。
The two countries trade frequently, with nearly 48,000 Vietnamese working in South Korea, including 4,000 in Daegu and Gyeongbei, the epicentre of the epidemic.
武德詹指出，实际上新冠肺炎疫情已经“暗中埋伏”在越南内部，如果不能有效控制，将出现内忧外患的局面。
Virtually the outbreak of pneumonia is already "lurking" inside Vietnam, Vudjan points out, and without effective control, there will be internal and external problems.
他表示，越南已制定好应对各种不同情况的计划，包括国内确诊患者达到上千人的情况，未来几天新增病例可能有几十甚至几百例。

The Vietnam Vaccine Steering Committee also recommended suspending visa-free policies for the European Union and the United Kingdom, as well as for other countries with cumulatively confirmed cases of more than 500 cases or more than 50 new cases per day.
任何出现发烧等症状的外国旅客将被禁止入境。
