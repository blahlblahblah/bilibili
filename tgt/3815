疫情发生以来，中国国家领导人参与了30余次外交互动，习主席指出，面对疫情，国际社会必须树立人类命运共同体意识，守望相助。
Since the outbreak of the epidemic, Chinese leaders have participated in more than 30 diplomatic interactions, and Xi pointed out that in the face of the epidemic, the international community must develop a sense of common destiny and stand by and help each other.
二、海外日增逾2万，世卫组织否定“中国病毒”之说图2海外新增病例达到20602例，集中在意大利、德国、西班牙、美国、法国和伊朗。
More than 20,000 people are overseas, and the WHO denies that there are "Chinese Viruses." Figure 2 shows 20,602 new cases overseas, concentrated in Italy, Germany, Spain, the United States, France and Iran.
海外累计死亡超过5000，又一个“悲剧性的里程碑”。
The cumulative death toll overseas is more than 5,000, another "tragic milestone."
世界卫生组织3月18日说，应避免将新冠病毒称为“中国病毒”，这不利于团结合作共同抗击疫情。
The World Health Organization said March 18, should avoid the new crown virus called "Chinese virus," which is not conducive to unity and cooperation in the fight against the epidemic.
世卫组织卫生紧急项目负责人迈克尔·瑞安说，“2009年的（甲型）H1N1流感大流行起源于北美，我们没有称它为‘北美流感’。
"The 2009 (A) H1N1 pandemic originated in North America, and we don't call it the 'North American flu,'" said Michael Ryan, director of the WHO's health emergency program.
所以涉及其他病毒时，我们采用同样的命名方法是非常重要的。
So when it comes to other viruses, it's important that we use the same nomenclature.
”图3意大利、德国、西班牙、美国都在快车道上。
Figure 3 shows Italy, Germany, Spain and the US all in the fast lane.
相比之下，法国控制的较好，有待后续观察。
France, by contrast, is better controlled, pending follow-up.
图4受https://coronavirus.1point3acres.com/zh网站的启发，小编恶补了一下早就还给高中老师的对数知识，意识到对数图可以让我们更好地了解疫情的态势。
Inspired by https: / / coronavirus.1 point3acres.com / en, the editor belaboured the lognormal knowledge that had long been returned to high school teachers, realizing that logarithms could give us a better understanding of the epidemic.
我们把几个国家的累计病例数转换为对数放在这里。
We converted the cumulative number of cases from several countries to logarithms and put them here.
让我们一起看看（图4）。
Let's look at it together (Figure 4).
首先要注意对数的尺度是数量级，每一格代表增加了一个数量级也就是加了个0。
The first thing to note is that the scale of the logarithm is an order of magnitude, and each cell represents an order of magnitude plus a 0.
“数说”此前曾经说过，病毒的可怕不在于它是个会吸血的跳蚤，而在于它的巨大繁殖能力。
Counting said before, the virus is not so much a blood-sucking flea as its enormous reproductive capacity.
一个跳蚤不可怕，但两三个月以后几百万上千万的跳蚤很可怕。
A flea is not terrible, but after two or three months millions of fleas are terrifying.
所以繁殖力（传染力）才是我们关注的第一重点。
So reproductive capacity (infectivity) is our number one priority.
而所有繁殖过程恰恰是以数量级变动为特征，即以指数函数的方式进行的。
And all the propagation process is exactly the order of magnitude change as the characteristic, that is, the exponential function way.
指数函数以对数图表达正好是直线（典型图中的红线），因此更加直观。
The exponential function is expressed as a logarithmic graph exactly as a straight line (the red line in a typical graph), so it is more intuitive.
辅助线（虚线）显示的不是区域，而是斜率。
The auxiliary line (dotted line) does not show the region, but the slope.
斜率越大（陡）表示倍增时间越短。
The larger the slope (steeper), the shorter the multiplication time.
我们看到，中国和韩国目前的斜率已经接近零（横平），病毒增殖已得到有效控制。
We see that the slope of China and South Korea is now close to zero (horizontal) and that virus proliferation has been effectively controlled.
意大利超越韩国后明显摆出了超越中国的态势。
When Italy overtook South Korea, it clearly overtook China.
意大利以外的欧洲已经超越中国，目前还在7天内倍增的轨道上。
Europe outside Italy has overtaken China and is now on track to double in seven days.
美国虽然起步最晚，但处在3日内倍增的轨道，近两天甚至还有加速趋势（斜率甚至陡于2日倍增线），已经超越同时期的韩国和意大利，超越中国基本也定局。
The US, which started out the last three days, is on a three-day multiplication track, and has even accelerated in the last two days (with a slope even steeper than the 2-day multiplier), surpassing South Korea and Italy by a wide margin.
真心希望美国各州及联邦最近的一系列措施，特别是检测隔离体系能够尽早到位，尽早见效。
We sincerely hope that the recent measures taken by the states and the United States, in particular the detection and isolation system, will be put in place as soon as possible.
三、美国终于提供免费新冠病毒检测图5美国单日新增已接近3000，累计确诊病例接近1万大关。
The United States has added nearly 3,000 new cases a day, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to nearly 10,000.
直接原因是大规模检测正在逐渐展开。
The immediate reason is that mass testing is gradually taking place.
3月18日，美国总统特朗普签署通过《家庭优先冠状病毒应急法》，它将为无保险者在内的所有人提供免费新冠肺炎筛查，并确保患者及家属能带薪休假，也将提供额外医疗援助，食物援助和失业救济，预计耗资超1000亿美元。
On March 18, US President Trump signed into law the Family Priority Coronavirus Emergency Act, which will provide free screening for coronary pneumonia for all, including the uninsured, and ensure that patients and their families can take paid leave. Additional medical assistance, food aid, and unemployment benefits are also expected to cost more than $100 billion.
特朗普还说，即将签署《国防生产法案》（The Defense Production Act）。
Trump also says he is about to sign the Defense Production Act.
这一法案生效将有助于加速并扩展工业生产力，支持军事、能源、国土安全等工作的需要。
Its entry into force will help to accelerate and expand industrial productivity and support the needs of the military, energy, homeland security, etc.
国防部长埃斯柏称，国防部将从战略储备资源中释放500万个N95级别防疫口罩及其他个人防护用具；准备2,000个医用呼吸器；部署两艘医疗船为抗疫救治能力扩容，据称每艘医疗船能够放置1,000张病床。
Defence Minister Asper said the Defense Department would release 5 million N95 class face masks and other personal protective gear from strategic reserve resources; prepare 2,000 medical respirators; and deploy two medical vessels to expand its capacity to fight the disease, each reportedly capable of holding 1,000 beds.
四、德国面临“二战以来最大挑战”，意大利8.3%医护人员感染图6欧洲央行在3月18日晚举行一次非常规会议，决定启动7500亿欧元的临时资产购买计划，以应对新冠肺炎疫情给货币政策传输机制以及欧元区经济预期造成的重大风险。
4. Germany faces "the biggest challenge since World War II," with the European Central Bank holding an extraordinary meeting on the night of March 18 to launch a €750 billion temporary asset purchase program to address the significant risks that the outbreak poses to the monetary-policy transmission mechanism and the eurozone economy.
德国总理默克尔（Angela Merkel）3月18日晚间罕见发表电视讲话，默克尔称，“自两德统一，不，自第二次世界大战以来，我们的国家还没有遇到过如此需要共同和团结行动的挑战。
In a rare televised speech on the evening of March 18, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said, "Since the reunification of Germany, no, our country has not faced such a challenge since the Second World War."
” 这次是默克尔近15年总理任期内极其罕见的电视讲话。
This was Merkel's rare televised speech in almost 15 years as chancellor.
此前她仅在每年新年夜以类似形式发表新年致辞。
She had previously made New Year's Eve statements in a similar fashion.
中国国务院总理李克强3月18日晚同欧盟委员会主席冯德莱恩通电话。
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang spoke by telephone with European Commission President von der Lean on the evening of March 18.
冯德莱恩称，目前欧方仍然急需采购防疫物资，希望中方继续予以协调支持。
Von Dryne said the EU is still in urgent need of epidemic prevention supplies, and hoped that China will continue to provide coordinated support.
同时欧方愿为在欧盟国家的中国公民包括留学生提供必要的保障和便利。
At the same time the EU is willing to provide Chinese citizens, including foreign students, with the necessary safeguards and facilities.
中国将为欧方通过商业渠道采购医疗物资提供便利。
China will facilitate the procurement of medical supplies from the European side through commercial channels.
随后，冯德莱恩又录制了视频讲话，称中国没有忘记疫情在国内暴发时欧盟提供的帮助，迅速向欧盟捐助了50多吨防疫物资。
Von Dreyne later recorded a video message saying China had not forgotten the EU's help in the event of an outbreak and had quickly donated more than 50 tons of vaccines to the European Union.
图7据中新社报道，意大利紧急民防部部长、新冠肺炎疫情新闻发言人博雷利3月18日表示，意大利全国医疗工作者已有2629人确诊感染，达到了从业人员的8.3%，这些医务工作者正在接受隔离治疗。
Italy has 2,629 health-care workers nationwide, 8.3 percent of whom are in quarantine, said Xinhua, the country's top civil defence minister and spokesman for the New Crown Pneumonia epidemic.
意大利全国各地的医院亟待解决卫生防护用品严重短缺现象。
Hospitals across Italy are in dire need of health protection supplies.
但是目前并不是所有意大利人都清楚疫情所带来的危机状况。
But not all Italians are aware of the crisis caused by the epidemic.
在伦巴第地区，通过分析手机定位数据，可以看到至少有40%的民众仍在外面自由活动。
In Lombardy, an analysis of mobile phone location data shows that at least 40 per cent of the population is still living outside freely.
意大利警方在上周累计共开出了17万张罚单，逾8000人遭到处罚，个别人或将面临刑事处罚。
Italy's police issued more than 170,000 tickets last week, and more than 8,000 people have been punished, with some facing possible criminal penalties.
当地时间3月18日，13人组成的中国第二批赴意大利抗疫医疗专家组和9吨医疗物资抵达米兰市，这批物资包括呼吸机、双通道输液泵、便携式彩超、实验室检测试剂和常用药品等。
On March 18, 13-member China's second batch of medical experts and nine tons of medical supplies arrived in Milan, including respirators, two-way transfusion pumps, portable color Doppler, laboratory testing reagents and commonly used drugs.
五、韩国再爆集中感染事件图8韩国新增病例时隔5日之后反弹至三位数。
Figure 8. New cases in South Korea rebound to three digits after a 5-day interval.
新增的152例中，来自大邱市和庆尚北道的共109例，分别为97例和12例。
Of the 152 new cases, 109 were from Daegu City and 12 from Gyeongshan North Province.
大邱新增病例出现反弹主要是因为当地一家疗养医院发生医患集体感染。
New cases in Daegu have rebounded mainly because of a mass infection in a local convalescent hospital.
截至19日0时，韩国境内共有30.7024万人接受了病毒检测。
By 0000 hours on the 19th, 307.04 million people in South Korea had been tested for the virus.
此外，韩国的境外输入病例也逐渐增多。
In addition, there has been a gradual increase in South Korea's foreign imports.
据韩国卫生部门统计，3月13日-17日边境检疫发现的确诊病例共计16人。
According to statistics from the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Korea, 16 confirmed cases were detected at the border quarantine on March 13-17.
韩国政府目前正在讨论采取额外措施，防止入境时无症状的感染旅客进入社区。
The Korean government is currently discussing additional measures to prevent asymptomatic infected passengers from entering the community.
六、伊朗在疫情中迎接新年图9伊朗明天将迎来波斯新年假期，据称德黑兰市集依然人来人往。
Iran Welcomes New Year Holidays in Iran 9 The city of Tehran is reportedly still busy tomorrow as it approaches the Persian New Year holiday.
为帮助伊朗抗击新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情，中国军队向伊朗武装力量紧急提供核酸检测试剂盒、防护服和一次性医用外科口罩等医疗物资已于3月19日运抵伊朗。
To help Iran fight the new coronavirus pneumonia, Chinese military emergency supplies to the Iranian armed forces, including nucleic acid test kits, protective clothing and disposable medical surgical masks, arrived in Iran on March 19.
【特别说明：以上统计，2月28日前为世卫组织官方统计数据，数据截止时间为北京时间每日17时；从2月28日开始，数据由《财经》根据公开资料统计，截止时间为北京时间每日9时】七、全球疫情数字速览：1、【美国Q2衰退14%】摩根大通美国首席经济学家迈克尔·费罗利（Michael Feroli）表示，2020年美国国内生产总值（GDP）将萎缩1.5%，二季度可能萎缩14%。
Data cut-off time is 17: 00 daily Beijing time since Feb. 28, according to Caijing Daily open data. Global epidemic figures show that US GDP will contract by 1.5% in 2020 and 14% in the second quarter, according to Michael Feroli, chief US economist at J.P. Morgan Chase.
这是迄今为止针对新冠病毒疫情对美国经济的影响作出的最悲观预测之一。
That is one of the gloomiest predictions yet about the impact of the new crown virus epidemic on the U. S. economy.
费罗利说，这还是在假设美联储将继续寻找“创造性”的方式来支撑经济，而特朗普政府和国会将提供1万亿美元财政支持的情况下。
Again, he said, it assumes that the Fed will continue to look for "creative" ways to prop up the economy, while the Trump administration and Congress will provide $1 trillion in financial support.
2、【全球一半学生停课】截至3月17日，全球已有逾8.5亿儿童和青少年因新冠肺炎疫情而停课，人数约为全球总学生数的一半。
As of March 17, more than 850 million children and young people worldwide, about half of the world's student population, had been suspended from classes because of the new crown pneumonia epidemic.
据联合国教科文组织网站消息，全球已有102个国家和地区全面停课，另有11个国家和地区局部停课。
According to UNESCO's website, 102 countries and regions have suspended classes altogether and another 11 countries and regions have partially suspended classes.
这意味着，短期之内面临学校停课的学生人数翻了一番，预计这一数字还将继续增长。
This means that the number of students facing school closures has doubled in the short term and is expected to continue to grow.
小结：武汉新增归0，中央再次强调“全面恢复”正常生产生活秩序。
Summary: Wuhan to add a new 0, the central government re-emphasize the "full restoration" of normal production and living order.
