大家新闻里总是听到“核酸检测试剂盒”这个东西，试剂盒里的试剂自己不能判断阴性阳性的，这些试剂要放到我负责的核酸检测设备里，才能得出检测结论。
You always hear in the news "nucleic acid test kit" this thing, the reagent in the kit itself can not judge the negative positive, these reagents have to be placed in my charge of nucleic acid testing equipment, in order to draw conclusions.
口述 | 彭　鑫整理 | 黄　祺现在大家说起去湖北，都感到非常恐惧。
At present, at the mention of visiting Hubei, Huang Qi is very frightened.
但因为工作，我最近去了几趟湖北，年初二那天的经历，就特别曲折。
But because of work, I recently went to Hubei several times, the experience of the second day of the New Year, especially twists and turns.
彭鑫我是罗氏诊断客户服务部的员工，工作地点在湖南长沙。
Peng Xin I am Roche diagnosis customer service staff, work in Changsha Hunan Province.
通俗地说，我的工作就是检测设备的售后培训和服务。
In layman's terms, my job is to test the equipment after-sales training and services.
我管的产品是核酸检测设备。
The product I handle is nucleic acid testing equipment.
核酸检测专业说法是“病毒核酸载量检测”，过去可能很多人对这些东西不了解，新冠肺炎疫情发生后，全国人民都知道“核酸检测”了。
Nucleic acid testing professional said that "viral nucleic acid load testing," which may not be known to many people in the past, after the outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia, the people of the country known "nucleic acid testing."
大家新闻里总是听到“核酸检测试剂盒”这个东西，试剂盒里的试剂自己不能判断阴性阳性的，这些试剂要放到我负责的核酸检测设备里，才能得出检测结论。
You always hear in the news "nucleic acid test kit" this thing, the reagent in the kit itself can not judge the negative positive, these reagents have to be placed in my charge of nucleic acid testing equipment, in order to draw conclusions.
这么打个比方吧：试剂盒就是汽油，我们的设备是汽车，汽油有了，得加进汽车，才能开起来。
For example: the kit is gasoline, our equipment is a car, gasoline has to be added to the car before it can start.
我的工作呢，相当于教人怎么开这辆车，以及维护汽车。
My job is to teach people how to drive this car and to maintain it.
新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情暴发后，我们罗氏诊断从上到下启动了紧急响应机制，集合全公司之力为客户精准检测保驾护航。
After the outbreak of the new coronavirus-infected pneumonia, we launched an emergency response mechanism from the top down to the bottom of the diagnosis.
彭鑫安装的设备为了增加核酸检测量，最近湖北疫情相关单位需要安装新的核酸检测设备，我们的任务就特别多。
Peng Xin installed equipment In order to increase the amount of nucleic acid detection, Hubei epidemic units need to install new nucleic acid detection equipment, our task is particularly large.
按照平时的流程，我们有专门负责安装设备的同事，我要等他们安装好以后去培训和调试就行了。
According to the usual procedure, we have a special equipment installation colleagues, I will wait until they are installed to train and debug.
但非常时期，我的任务也变了。
But in times of crisis, my mission changed, too.
初二上午我接到同事消息，湖北荆门市疾控中心需要安装一台LightCycler 480，当时公司在武汉有这台仪器的库存，但武汉的同事出武汉必须申请通行证，这个通行证必须当天返回武汉，如果他送过去再安装完，恐怕时间来不及。
Wuhan colleagues must apply for a laissez-passer, which must be returned to Wuhan the same day. If he delivers it and installs it, I am afraid it will be too late.
而武汉售后部门的同事出不了城，需要我去负责安装和培训。
Wuhan sales department and colleagues can not get out of the city, I need to be responsible for installation and training.
我们准备来个配合，他从武汉送设备到荆门，我从长沙赶过去安装和培训。
We are ready to cooperate, he sent equipment from Wuhan to Jingmen, I rushed from Changsha installation and training.
长沙到荆门将近500公里，正常开车4个多小时，非常时期，我要做一些准备。
Changsha to Jingmen nearly 500 kilometers, normal driving more than four hours, very unusual period, I have to do some preparation.
现在湖北交通是封闭的，我赶紧联系客户为我开通行证，我们这是为疫情服务的任务，是可以放行的。
Hubei traffic is now closed, I hastened to contact customers to issue permits for me, we are for the epidemic mission, can be released.
有了这个最关键的东西，我又带好了防护用品，再放了很多矿泉水在车上，下午3点出发。
With this most critical thing, I took my protective gear and put a lot of mineral water in the car, leaving at 3: 00 p.m.
我开着导航上了高速，走着走着，导航叫我下高速。
I drove up the freeway, walked, and the navigation told me to go down the freeway.
后来想想可能是因为封路，导航也搞不清该怎么走。
Later on, perhaps because of the road closure, navigation is not clear how to go.
一下高速，我就意识到麻烦了，我必须重新返回高速才能到荆门。
At high speed, I realized I was in trouble. I had to get back on the highway to Jingmen.
走了一段国道，位置大概属于湖北潜江市。
Walked a section of the national road, the location of Hubei submerged river city.
到一个路口，前面封路，我看别的车拐进了一条岔道，我也跟着拐进去。
At a junction, in front of the road, I watched other cars turn into a fork in the road, and I followed.
这时已经是傍晚六七点钟，天黑了，我竟然开进了一个村子。
It was six or seven o'clock in the evening, and it was dark when I drove into a village.
我想开出来，可是很多路口堆了土堆，有的是一辆拖拉机封路。
I wanted to drive it out, but there were lots of junctions piled up with dirt, some of them blocked by a tractor.
我在这个村子里兜来兜去，怎么也找不到出路。
I'm going round the village, but I can't find my way out.
乡村道路上遇到路障实在没办法，我下车敲开一户人家的门，这个老乡给了我村支书的电话。
There was nothing I could do about the barricade on the country road. I got out and knocked on the door of a house. The villager gave me a telephone number for my village branch.
我找到村支书，跟他说我是去送设备的，是帮助新冠肺炎检查的。
I found the village paper and told him that I was going to deliver the equipment to help with the new crown pneumonia.
村支书一听，很重视，立马打电话叫人来把拖拉机挪开，让我出去。
The village branch book listens, very important, call immediately call someone to move tractor away, let me out.
在村支书的帮助下，我终于离开了这个村子。
With the help of the village branch, I finally left the village.
乡村道路上遇到路障不过“挫折”还没结束。
There are roadblocks on the country roads but the "setbacks" are not over.
走了一段路，我又被更大的土堆挡住了，我下车找木板，想搭桥开过去，可是土堆太高了，没成功。
After walking some distance, I was stopped by a still larger pile of dirt, and I got out to look for the planks and tried to cross it, but the pile was too high to succeed.
同事打电话，问我到哪里了？我也急啊。
My colleague called and asked me where I had been? I was in a hurry, too.
这时候一个老乡路过，我问他怎么能开出去。
Just then an old fellow passed by and I asked him how he could get out.
他说他知道一个出口，然后开着摩托车带路，把我送到可以上高速的地方。
He said he knew an exit and drove the motorbike to a place where I could get on the highway.
这么晚了，又是大过年的，我心里特别感激这位老乡，掏出钱要给他个红包，但这位老乡没要。
So late, it is the New Year's Day, I am particularly grateful to this fellow countryman, took out money to give him a red envelope, but the villager did not ask.
我在乡村道路上绕了2个小时，终于重新回到高速。
I walked around the country road for two hours and finally got back to speed.
深夜到达荆门有通行证，我顺利进入荆门市，这时候已经是夜里11点。
I arrived in Jingmen late at night with a pass. I entered Jingmen city smoothly.
我联系疾控中心的老师，他们还在忙其他任务，告诉我第二天装机。
I contacted the CDC teacher, who was busy with other tasks and told me to install the plane the next day.
这段时间他们都在加班，特别辛苦。
They are all working overtime these days, which is very hard.
荆门已经进入非常状态，没有酒店正常营业，还好疾控中心的老师帮我联系他们最近加班休息的宾馆，让出一间房间给我住。
Jingmen has entered a state of emergency, no hotel normal business, but fortunately the CDC teachers help me contact their recently overtime rest hotel, let me have a room for me.
到酒店，我泡了一碗方便面吃，这时候才发现好饿啊。
To the hotel, I made a bowl of instant noodles to eat, this time found very hungry ah.
临睡前，我把第二天给疾控中心做培训的方案、冠状病毒提取分析判断及世界卫生组织（WHO）指南信息等，进行了多次梳理和复盘，希望帮助疾控中心的老师尽快熟悉设备及优化实验方案。
Before I went to bed, I combed and dished out the training program for the CDC the next day, the diagnosis of coronavirus extraction and the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, hoping to help CDC teachers become familiar with the equipment and optimize the experimental plan as soon as possible.
彭鑫第二天一早到疾控中心装机，给技术人员做培训。
Peng Xin the next morning to the early installation of the CDC, technical personnel to do training.
我们平常工作时有专门的工作服，要做一些防护，但穿如此高等级的防护服工作还是第一次。
We usually work in special overalls, to do some protection, but wearing such a high-grade protective clothing work is the first time.
因为新冠疫情，疾控部门也提高了防护标准。
Because of the new crown outbreak, the disease control department has also raised the protection standard.
忙到下午1点多，所有工作完成，疾控的老师点了外卖，大家一起吃了一顿热饭热菜。
Busy until 1: 00 pm, all the work was done, the disease control teacher ordered take-out, we ate a hot meal together.
在荆门疾控中心吃上了外卖盒饭盒饭吃完，我得赶紧回长沙，路上又是6个小时，靠红牛“续命”。
At Jingmen CDC eat lunch box lunch box, I have to hurry back to Changsha, the road is another six hours, rely on Red Bull "life."
启程回湖南我在罗氏诊断工作5年了，之前也完成过一些紧急的任务。
Going back to Hunan I've been working on Roche's diagnosis for five years, and I've done some urgent work before.
比如说非洲猪瘟，其实也挺严重的，我们向动物防疫部门提供检测设备，在疫情控制中发挥了重要的作用。
For example, African swine fever, in fact quite serious, we provide animal epidemic prevention departments with detection equipment, played an important role in disease control.
只不过猪瘟没有发生人传人，一般人可能体会不到，但在畜牧行业里，是非常严重的疫情。
However, swine fever does not occur from person to person, the general public may not experience, but in the livestock industry, is a very serious epidemic.
接下去可能还要去几次湖北，现在正是最需要高质量核酸检测仪器的时候，我们做这个工作，可以为抗疫做一些贡献，我觉得挺高兴的。
The next few trips to Hubei will probably follow, and I'm glad that we can do something about it when we need high-quality nucleic acid testing instruments most.
一来一回， 辗转腾挪，一路上遇到太多好人，让我感动，自己也想多尽点责任。
Once, toss and turn, along the way encountered too many good people, let me moved, I also want to do more responsibility.
