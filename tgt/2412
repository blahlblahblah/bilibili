澎湃新闻记者 张若婷“我卖了四年口罩，不如那四天卖得多。
Zhang Ruoting, a journalist, said: "I sold my mask for four years, not as much as four days.
”刚刚经历了“过山车”一样的一个月，小为口罩投资人石女士十分感慨。
Just went through the "roller coaster" like a month, small investors for mask investors Shi lament very much.
自2016年10月开始，由于看准“熔体微分静电纺丝纳米纤维”这种技术的发展前景，石芳决定投资这家原本是北京化工大学学生创业项目的企业，创立了自主研发纳米重复可洗技术的“小为口罩”。
Starting in October 2016, given the promise of the technology known as "melt differential electrostatic spinning nanofibers," Shi Fang decided to invest in the enterprise, originally a student-initiated project at Beijing Chemical University, to create a "small mask" that would independently develop nanorepeat washable technology.
没想到，累计投资了约750万元在人工、技术二次开发、生产上，口罩销量仍然惨淡。
Unexpectedly, the cumulative investment of about 7.5 million yuan in manual, technical secondary development, production, mask sales are still bleak.
2019年年底，石女士决定裁掉所有员工，解散公司。
At the end of 2019, Ms Shi decided to lay off all her employees and dissolve the company.
今年1月16日，公司财务清算完毕，20余名员工中的大多数拿了赔偿金，离开位于北京市大兴区亦庄的工厂，回家过年。
On January 16 this year, after the company's financial liquidation was completed, most of the more than 20 employees took compensation and left their factory in Yizhuang, Daxing District, Beijing, for the New Year.
彼时，工厂仓库里还有约16万只积压的没卖出去的口罩。
At the time, there were about 160,000 unsold face masks in the factory's warehouse.
直到新冠肺炎疫情的突然暴发。
Until the outbreak of new crown pneumonia.
四天清理了四年的库存“我眼睁睁看着线上需求量上涨到一天9000单，根本打包不过来。
Four days of clean-up of inventory "I watched online demand rise to 9,000 units a day and couldn't be packed at all.
”到了1月22日，通宵没睡打包发货的石女士“崩溃”了，想到把口罩捐赠给医疗机构。
On January 22, Ms. Shi, who had been up all night packing and shipping, broke down and thought of donating a mask to a medical organization.
然而一番沟通之后，由于这些“纳米纤维膜”口罩过滤标准与大家普遍认知的“N95”不同，多数机构都拒绝了石女士的捐赠。
After some communication, however, most of the organizations turned down Ms. Shi's donation because the filtration criteria for the nanofilm masks were different from the generally accepted N95.
捐不出去，但线上的需求依然火爆，石女士只得叫回了一部分已回家过年的工人，又发动一切资源召集打包人员终于在大年三十下午打包完所有快递。
Can not donate, but the demand on the line is still hot, Ms. Shi had to call back some of the workers who have gone home for the New Year, and mobilize all the resources to assemble the packaging staff at the end of the New Year's Eve packed all the express.
她记得，截至那天晚上七点半快递停运，短短两三天里他们一共出了约2万单货，卖出去了5万多只口罩。
She remembers that by 7: 30 pm they had sent out about 20,000 items and sold more than 50,000 masks in just two or three days.
有口罩货源的消息传出去后，多家大型企业、中央企业找上门来。
After the news of the source of the mask delivery, many large enterprises, central enterprises look for the door.
就这样，2020年的春节，原本走到末路的新技术口罩企业十几万只的库存几乎全部清空。
In this way, the Spring Festival in 2020, the end of the road to the new technology mask enterprises almost entirely empty the inventory of tens of thousands.
对石女士来说，这件事到现在还像“做梦一样”，在全国人民开始疯抢口罩的背景下，不少濒临倒闭的企业起死回生，“熔喷布”、“纳米纤维膜”等之前略显生僻的名词也开始出现在各类报道中。
For Ms Shi, the incident is still a "dream," as people across the country start to grab masks, and a number of near-bankrupt companies are resurrecting, and previously slightly eccentric terms such as "melting cloth" and "nanofilm" are beginning to appear in various reports.
疫情下意外火爆的新技术：可长期存储，应用领域广泛“纳米纤维膜”这一概念最近突然“火了”。
New technology for unexpected outbreaks: long-term storage, and the concept of "nanofiber membranes" in a wide range of applications has suddenly become "hot."
国务院总理李克强2月21日在专程到北京市海淀区一家临时转产的企业督战口罩生产时，企业重点介绍了纳米纤维膜，表示该材料可以替代熔喷布作为口罩滤材，并可以解决口罩多次使用的难题。
When Premier Li Keqiang visited a temporary factory in Haidian District on Feb. 21 to produce face masks, the company focused on nanofiber membranes, saying they could replace the spray cloth as a mask filter and solve the problem of the mask's repeated use.
总理要求药监部门要加快审核，一旦通过，加大批量生产。
The Prime Minister asked the department to speed up the review, once approved, to increase mass production.
2月25日，在国务院联防联控机制举办的新闻发布会上，国家发展改革委社会司司长欧晓理表示，目前全国口罩产能利用率已经达到110%左右，口罩的供应情况会持续改善。
On 25 February, at a press conference organized by the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council, Ou Xiaoli, director of the social affairs department of the National Development and Reform Commission, said capacity utilization of masks nationwide had reached about 110 percent, and the supply of masks would continue to improve.
欧晓理还表示，应科学按需使用口罩，减少不必要的浪费，在当前很有必要。
Xiaoli also said that science should be used on the basis of need to reduce unnecessary waste, is very necessary at present.
纳米纤维膜滤材，就是有希望让口罩重复利用、减少浪费的材料。
Nanometer fiber membrane filter is a promising material to reuse masks and reduce waste.
事实上，口罩要过滤粉尘和飞沫，主要靠其中间的过滤层。
In fact, the mask filters dust and droplets, mainly through a filter layer in the middle.
市场上“一布难求”、价格上涨的“熔喷布”就是目前大规模应用于生产的过滤层材料，其主要原料为聚丙烯，是一种纤维直径在2微米左右的超细静电纤维布，具有良好的过滤性、屏蔽性、绝热性和吸油性。
The "melt-jet fabric" in the market is a kind of filter material which is widely used in production. The main material is polypropylene. It is a kind of ultra-fine electrostatic fiber cloth with fiber diameter of about 2 micron, with good filter, shielding, insulation and oil absorption.
现有N95及医用口罩核心滤材均采用的熔喷技术，是指依靠高速、高温气流喷吹聚合物熔体使其得到迅速拉伸而形成纤维。
The current N95 and medical mask core filter materials are used to spray polymer melt by high-speed and high-temperature airflow to obtain rapid tensile fiber formation.
它的过滤功能主要依靠两个特点：一是直径小，能够“网住”较大颗粒的粉尘；二是表面带有静电，颗粒会被静电吸附在表面，无法透过。
Its filtering function mainly relies on two characteristics: one is small diameter, can "net" larger particles of dust; the other is the surface with static electricity, particles will be electrostatic adsorbed on the surface, can not penetrate.
但“熔喷布”口罩的缺点也很明显：洗过之后，静电释放就会失效，因此只能一次性使用，这也是造成当前口罩紧缺的原因之一。
But the weakness of the mask is also obvious: after washing, the static release will be ineffective, so can only be used once, which is one of the reasons for the current shortage of masks.
作为熔喷布的有效替代品，纳米纤维膜技术并非是最近才“横空出世”的，也不仅仅适用于口罩产业。
Nanofilm membranes, an effective alternative to fusible fabrics, have not only been "born out of thin air" recently, nor are they just for use in the mask industry.
澎湃新闻记者了解到，纳米纤维膜与传统熔喷布材料的过滤机理不同。
Peng Pai journalists understand that the nanofiber membrane and the traditional melt-jet material filtration mechanism is different.
熔喷布纤维表面静电如果消失，过滤效率将明显下降；而纳米纤维主要依靠物理拦截，因此在消静电处理后，过滤效率基本保持。
If the surface static electricity disappeared, the filtration efficiency would obviously decrease, and the nanofibers mainly rely on the physical interception, so the filtration efficiency is basically maintained after antistatic treatment.
清华大学深圳国际研究生院李勃研究员团队与材料学院伍晖副教授团队近年来一直在合作开发纳米纤维类材料，近日，他们紧急启动了用于口罩中间过滤层材料的纳米纤维膜的二次开发，目前，相关材料已经加快第三方检测工作。
Associate Professor Wu Hui of the School of Materials and Research at the Shenzhen Graduate School of International Studies at Tsinghua University have been working on nanofiber materials in recent years. Recently, they launched the secondary development of nanofiber membranes for middle filter materials for masks.
清华大学团队开发的纳米纤维过滤材料微观相貌李勃与伍晖告诉记者，运用纳米纤维作为核心过滤材料，优点是可以长期存储、反复消毒使用；而缺点是气阻一般高于熔喷材料，也就是通俗所说的可能存在“憋气”的问题。
Using nanofibers as a core filter material has the advantage of long-term storage and repeated disinfection, while the disadvantage is that the gas resistance is generally higher than that of the spray material, which is popularly known as "suffocation," Li Bo and Wu Hui told reporters.
除了医疗领域外，这种纳米纤维膜对于很多熔喷材料无法面对的净化领域很有意义，比如高湿条件下的净化过滤、油性颗粒为主情况下的净化过滤，在海洋船舶领域和畜牧业领域也有较好的应用前景。
In addition to the medical field, the nanofilm film is of great significance to many areas of purification which the molten material cannot face, such as purifying filtration under high humidity conditions and purifying filtration under oily particles.
纳米纤维材料制备的方法有多种，李勃和伍晖的团队采用的是气纺法纳米纤维，而北京化工大学机电工程学院杨卫民教授团队则长期研究的是熔体微分静电纺丝纳米纤维技术。
There are a variety of methods for preparing nanofibers, with Li Bo and Wu Hui's team using gas-spinning nanofibers, while Professor Yang Weimin of the Faculty of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering of Beijing Chemical University has long studied melt differential electrostatic spinning nanofiber technology.
“静电纺丝纳米纤维这项技术国际上早就有了，但有一定的局限。
"Electrostatic spinning nanofibers have long been used in the world, but they have certain limitations.
”杨卫民在接受澎湃新闻记者采访时表示。
"Yang Weimin told reporters in an interview.
杨卫民团队研发的熔体微分静电纺丝纳米纤维，是指在10万伏高压静电场喷射而成的纳米级长纤维，无需化学溶剂，绿色环保。
The melt differential electrostatic spinning nanofibers developed by Yang Weimin's team refer to nanofibers sprayed with 100,000 volts of high voltage electrostatic field, without chemical solvent and environmental protection.
杨卫民团队研发的纳米纤维口罩技术方案原理简图杨卫民团队研发的纳米纤维膜口罩可以反复水洗使用的原因有二：一是过滤原理不是靠静电吸附病毒颗粒，而是靠上千层的纳米长纤维，一层一层构成“迷宫”，通过物理阻拦病毒颗粒。
The simple picture of nanofiber mask technology developed by Yang Weimin's team can be used repeatedly for two reasons: First, the principle of filtration is not by static adsorption of virus particles, but by thousands of layers of nanofibers, layer by layer form a "labyrinth," physically blocking virus particles.
二是采用的不是短纤维，而是纳米级长纤维，可洗重复使用。
The second is not short fiber, but nanometer fiber, can be washed repeatedly.
“纳米纤维膜和熔喷布相比，就像羊绒和羊毛的关系。
"Nano-fiber membranes are like cashmere to wool when compared to molten cloth.
”杨卫民总结道。
Yang Weimin concluded.
自2016年起，杨卫民团队与前述的“小为口罩”合作，开始量产纳米重复可洗口罩，然而销量却并不乐观。
Since 2016, Yang's team has been working with the aforementioned "Mask Mask" to start mass-producing nano-reusable masks, but sales are not encouraging.
杨卫民和李勃、伍晖团队也对记者坦承，从目前的规模来看，纳米纤维膜在口罩生产的应用上的确成本要更高，技术上也还需要改进，比如李勃称，他们研发的材料使用在高标号的kn95及以上的口罩，气阻还需要进一步降低。
Yang and Li Bo, Wu Hui team also admitted to reporters, from the current scale, nano-fiber film production in the use of masks do cost more, but also need to improve technology, such as Li Bo said that their materials used in high-label KN 95 and above, the gas resistance needs to be further reduced.
未来何在？成本仍较高，或可培养自主品牌最近，越来越多高校和企业团队加入了纳米纤维膜技术的研发。
Where is the future? Costs are still high, or independent brands can be cultivated Recently, more and more universities and business teams have joined the development of nanofiber membrane technology.
2月25日，据央广网报道，广东工业大学联手多个研究团队，研发出了纳米纤维静电纺丝批量生产设备以及医用口罩纳米纤维滤膜，生产线每日可产30万个滤膜材料。
On Feb. 25, Guangdong University of Technology teamed up with research teams to develop a mass production facility for nano-fiber electrospinning and a nanofilament filter for medical masks, which can produce 300,000 filters a day, CCBA reported.
近日，文汇报报道称，上海一家企业使用自主知识产权的纳米纤维微孔薄膜材料，开发出了可循环使用、可多次消毒、同时过滤级别达到了N95的防护口罩，目前已投入到批量生产。
A Shanghai-based company has developed a recyclable, multi-sterile, N95-grade face mask using nano-fiber microporous membrane material, which is now in mass production, Wen reported recently.
2月27日，这款由上海巨臣婴童服饰股份有限公司与上海汉圃新材料科技有限公司共同开发的口罩已开启团购渠道，试用体验价为每只15元。
The mask, developed by Shanghai-based Giant Baby Costume Co. Ltd. and Shanghai Hanbu New Materials Technology Co. Ltd, has opened a group purchasing channel for a trial trial price of $15 each.
由于当前产能有限，上海市企业服务云决定，每家企业订购数量限定为100只（一箱），仅限企业自用。
Due to the current limited production capacity, Shanghai Enterprise Service cloud decided to limit the number of orders per enterprise to 100 (one box), only for business use.
有分析师认为，在本次疫情的口罩刚需背景下，消费者对劳动保护、个人防护方面用品认识的深入、医用口罩的高性价比等因素会使医用口罩市场得到快速发展。
Some analysts believe that under the background of the epidemic mask, consumers on labour protection, personal protection of the depth of supplies, medical masks cost-effective factors and other factors will make the market for medical masks will be rapid development.
当前，新型滤材的战略安全价值和市场价值凸显出来。
At present, the strategic safety value and market value of the new filter material stand out.
尤其是可重复使用的口罩产品，可以有效减缓物资短缺的压力和减少医疗危废的产生。
In particular, reusable mask products can effectively reduce the pressure of material shortages and reduce the generation of medical waste.
“比如说现在用我们的材料做成同样的口罩，所用的滤层材料质量可以是原来熔喷的1/10，如果再可以重复使用十次，那就相当于所用的滤材质量是原来一次性口罩的1/100。
"Now, for example, we make the same mask out of our material, using a filter material that is about 1 / 10 of the quality of the original blow-out. If you can reuse it 10 times, it's equivalent to using a filter that is 1 / 100th the quality of the original disposable mask.
”李勃、伍晖团队表示。
Li Bo, Wu Hui team said.
团队认为，疫情结束后，考虑到在正常情况下熔喷材料的成本更有优势，这一技术的市场优势可能在于满足国家长期存储的战略物资储备需求，以及在可水洗、可反复使用口罩领域的差异化应用。
The team believes that the market advantage of this technology may lie in meeting the country's long-term storage requirements for strategic stocks, as well as differentiated applications in the area of washable, reusable masks, given that the cost of fusible spray materials would normally be more advantageous.
杨卫民表示，成本与生产规模关系很大，如果能像熔喷布那样上万吨大量生产，纳米纤维膜口罩的生产成本将大大降低。
The cost is highly correlated with the scale of production and the cost of producing nanofibre film masks would be greatly reduced if tens of thousands of tonnes were produced in bulk, as in the case of fuzes, Yang said.
但多位材料领域专家受访时同样表示，纳米纤维膜目前在产业化方面还没有太多积累。
But a number of materials experts interviewed in the field of the same said that the nanofilm film in industrialization has not accumulated too much.
疫情突发，防护物质短缺，使口罩成为全社会焦点，这很大程度上放大了过滤材料的意义。
Outbreaks and shortages of protective materials have made masks the focus of society, greatly amplifying the significance of filtering materials.
纳米纤维膜技术是否是受疫情催发的“昙花一现”？在市场和技术之外，品牌和标准同样是重要的考虑因素。
Is nanofiber membrane technology a "flash in the pan" driven by the epidemic? Brands and standards are equally important considerations beyond markets and technology.
李勃认为，这一市场目前主要被美国3M（明尼苏达矿务及制造业公司）等个别厂家占领，当前阶段是个机会，可以在这方面培养中国的自主品牌。
The market is dominated by individual players such as 3M (Minnesota Minnesota Minerals & Manufacturing), and the current phase is an opportunity to nurture China's own brands in this regard, according to Riber.
在石女士和杨卫民看来，大众对于口罩领域的国内和国际技术标准也存在认知鸿沟。
According to Ms Shi and Mr Yang, there is also a perceived gap between domestic and international technical standards for masks.
拿杨卫民团队研发的口罩来看，产品已经通过新国标A级检测，符合 GB/T32610-2016《日常防护型口罩技术规范》，能有效阻挡病毒细菌。
According to the mask developed by Yang Weimin's team, the product has passed the new national standard A level and conforms to GB / T32610-2016 Technical Specification for Daily Protection Mask, which can effectively block viral bacteria.
记者梳理后发现，GB/T32610-2016标准由全国纺织品标准化技术委员会制定，在这一标准下防护级别为A，或过滤级别为二级以上，则口罩质量近似于KN95/N95口罩。
Reporters combed and found that the GB / T32610-2016 standard was developed by the National Technical Committee for Textile Standardization, under which the level of protection was A or above, and the quality of the mask was similar to that of KN95 / N95 mask.
国内的KN95标准与美国N95标准相同，即非油性颗粒物过滤效率达到95%以上，防泄漏、防盐，可以防大多数空气污染。
The domestic KN95 standard is the same as the US N95 standard, i.e. non-oily particulate matter filtration efficiency of over 95%, leak-proof, salt-proof, can prevent most air pollution.
好在随着疫情的发展，新技术口罩大众认知的空白正在一点点被填补，大众及政府对这一新技术的关注也给了这类中小企业新的希望。
Fortunately, as the epidemic progresses, the gap in public perception of new technology masks is being filled, and public and government attention to the new technology has given them new hope.
