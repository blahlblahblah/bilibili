In the last episode before the Spring Festival, I announced that FM would have a holiday for a week and would come back to see you later.
但是这个春节啊，我们团队都无心过年，大家最关心的还是身处武汉和周边疫区的朋友现在的状态怎么样。
But this Spring Festival, our team are not interested in the New Year, we are most concerned about the situation of friends in Wuhan and surrounding epidemic areas.
因为虽然朋友圈里各种消息满天飞，但哪些是真哪些是假非常不好判断。
Because although the circle of friends of all kinds of information flying, but what is true and which is false is very difficult to judge.
所以今天我们团队一合计，干脆也别过什么年了，立刻开始联络采访武汉的朋友们，请他们来讲一讲身处其中真实的体验和困难是什么。
So today our team a total, simply do not live for another year, immediately began to contact Wuhan friends, ask them to tell us about the real experience and difficulties.
何鸭梨，@武汉市洪山区 「剧本杀」桌游店店主，怀孕五个月我印象中，一月初的时候，我们就听到传言，说武汉爆发了一种很严重的流感。
He Yali Pear, @ Wuhan Hongshan City "screenplay kill" table store owner, five months pregnant I remember, in early January, we heard rumors of a very serious outbreak of flu in Wuhan.
但当时政府做了辟谣，让大家不要担心，我们也就没有放在心上，店里的生意依旧红火。
But then the government made a rumor, let us not worry, we did not pay attention to, the store business is still booming.
一直到 1 月 20 日左右，我们都依然在营业。
We were still open until around 20 January.
那段时间，虽然店里的员工都会戴上口罩上班，也会提醒玩家注意，但当时大众真的没有丝毫警惕性，在店里玩的时候都没人戴口罩，也并不觉得跟这么多人聚在一起有什么问题。
At that time, although the store staff will wear masks to work, will remind players, but at that time the public really did not have any vigilance, play in the store when no one wearing masks, do not feel so many people together with the problem.
直到 1 月 22 日，我们听说有了一例死亡的案例，这才意识到问题的严重性。
We didn't realize the seriousness of the problem until we heard of a case of death on January 22nd.
从那天起，像我们这样的娱乐场所就都关门了。
From that day on, places of entertainment like ours were closed.
就在那一天，我发现我们夫妻俩的体温都有点高，于是不放心，就决定找一家定点医院看一下。
On that very day, I found that both of us had a little high body temperature, so I decided to go to a designated hospital for a look.
1 月 23 日晚上，我们去了同济光谷院区。
On the evening of January 23, we went to Tongji Valley District.
这家医院是武汉的定点医院之一，离市中心较远。
This hospital is one of Wuhan's designated hospitals, far from the city center.
之所以选择这里也是因为我们在网上看到，市中心的医院都爆满了，担心去了反而染病。
It was also chosen because we saw on the Internet that hospitals in the center of the city were full and worried about getting sick instead.
抵达医院的时候，我发现医院的人流量果然不多。
When I arrived at the hospital, I found the traffic was really small.
而进入医院的过程中，我注意到值班的保安只戴了一层口罩，院里面还在做一些紧急的施工和布防，不知道是不是为了后面的一些相关工作。
As I entered the hospital, I noticed that the guard on duty was only wearing a mask, and the hospital was still doing some urgent construction and layout work.
施工的工人也都是只戴了口罩。
The workers were also all wearing masks.
一开始，我们走错了，到了发热的诊疗室。
At first, we made a mistake and went to the hot clinic.
那边已经存在了大约 30 个病患，有的在吊水，有的在不停的做血液的检验。
There are already about 30 patients there, some hanging water, some constantly doing blood tests.
旁边停了一辆救护车，救护车附近的几个工作人员全副武装，穿着防护服。
An ambulance was parked nearby, and several staff members in the vicinity were armed and wearing protective clothing.
从发热科出来后，我们去了急诊部。
After getting out of the fever department, we went to the emergency department.
只有急诊门口的两三个医护人员在做分诊的时候穿了比较完备的防护服，其他的医护人员都是没有做完全的防护的。
Only two or three paramedics at the gate of the emergency department wear relatively complete protective clothing when making medical appointments, and the rest of the staff are not fully protected.
我们到了之后先挂号，然后就直接在分诊台做分诊处理。
When we arrive, we register first, and then we go straight to the clinic.
整个挂号过程中，我们大概碰到了 20 多个病人，大多数人都是来挂发热这一科的，说自己有体温异常。
Throughout the registration process, we probably met more than 20 patients, most of whom came to hang up the fever department, said they had abnormal body temperature.
他们统一的操作是给你一个温度计，让你在旁边去进行一个体温自测。
Their uniform operation is to give you a thermometer, you go to the side of a temperature self-test.
如果温度不算高，没有到达一个比较明确的高值的话，医生就会问你要不要做下一步的检查。
If the temperature is not high enough to reach a certain high value, the doctor will ask if you want to do the next check-up.
如果没有并发症，医生就会建议你回家了。
If there are no complications, the doctor will advise you to go home.
测量之后，我的体温正常，而我先生的体温 37.4 度，比临界值稍微高一点点。
After the measurements, my temperature was normal and my husband's temperature was 37.4 degrees, a little above the threshold.
医生看了他的状况，建议他到武汉的第五医院去做检测。
The doctor looked at his condition and suggested that he go to Wuhan Fifth Hospital for a test.
他说，他们医院目前只收治确诊病人，按照我先生的状况，如果留下来做检查，反而有被感染的风险。
He said that his hospital currently only admitted confirmed patients, according to my husband's condition, if left to check, there is a risk of infection.
而与此同时，我注意到现场的很多病人都得到了这样的建议，但问题是，医院并没有专门的隔离车，送病人转诊，而第二天，武汉的公共交通就已经停运了，病人看病变得更加不方便。
At the same time, I noticed that many patients at the scene received such advice, but the problem is that hospitals do not have special isolation cars to transport patients, and the next day, Wuhan's public transport has been suspended, making it more inconvenient for patients to see their patients.
从我在这家医院观察到的现象来看，在那个时候，武汉的医疗资源负担已经很沉重了。
Judging from what I have observed in this hospital, Wuhan's medical resource burden was already heavy at that time.
我们去的时候大概是晚上 8 点多，而医院里不到 10 个人的医疗团队要对付 30 多个已经确诊的病人，同时还要处理新的病人。
When we went there, it was about 8 p. m., and the team of less than 10 people in the hospital had to deal with more than 30 patients who had already been diagnosed, as well as new patients.
而这家医院属于三甲医院，在武汉已经算是一个级别非常高的医院了，但是在这种情况之下，我们也感觉到，他们在夜间的诊疗的过程中抽调不出过多的人手来。
The hospital belongs to Sanjia Hospital, which is already a very high-level hospital in Wuhan, but in this situation, we also feel that they can not draw too many people in the course of the diagnosis and treatment at night.
后来，我们考虑到交叉感染的风险，就没有去别的医院检查，而是回到家里观察。
Later, taking into account the risk of cross-infection, we did not go to another hospital for an examination, but went home to observe it.
目前为止，我们的身体状况都没什么问题。
So far, we haven't had any medical problems.
其实，我个人最担心的，是接下来整个孕期该怎么走。
In fact, I personally worry most is the next pregnancy should be how to go.
很快，二月中我就要去医院进行相关的产检，也就是说，无论如何还要去一趟医院。
Soon, in the middle of February, I was going to the hospital for a check-up, which meant going to the hospital anyway.
而在这个过程中，由于有武汉的机动车辆已经被限制出行了，我作为孕妇去医院极为不方便。
In the process, as Wuhan motor vehicles have been restricted to travel, I as a pregnant woman to the hospital is extremely inconvenient.
不仅如此，在接下来的孕期，直到我生产的时候，疫情都给我和我宝宝的健康带来了太多的不确定性。
Not only that, but during the rest of my pregnancy, right up to the time I gave birth, the epidemic created too much uncertainty for my baby and me.
除此以外，我还有一点担心是，我们现在无法预测这场疫情会持续到什么时候。
In addition to that, I am also concerned that we are not yet able to predict when the epidemic will continue.
而在它结束之前，武汉的所有经营行为都是没有办法正常运转的。
And before it ends, Wuhan all the business operations are not able to function properly.
在此期间，我一方面要负担店面的房租，一方面却没有任何收入，不知道社会经济会撑多久。
In the meantime, I have to pay the rent for the storefront, on the one hand, but no income, do not know how long the socio-economic will last.
我最担心是，这样的长期的情况之下，会产生一些群众的过激情绪和过激行为，带来治安隐患。
I am most worried that under such a long-term situation, there will be some people's over-emotion and extreme behavior, bring public security hidden danger.
此外，我们也不希望看到太多的谣传。
Moreover, we do not wish to see too many rumours.
那些谣传对于我们武汉本地人来说压力很大，比如说之前说的那种有什么有人死在路上了，死在医院没人管了等等。
Those rumors are very stressful for us in Wuhan, such as the kind of people who died on the road, died in the hospital nobody took care of, and so on.
就我所目睹的情况来看，尽管武汉的医疗系统压力很大，但相对来说并没有出现失控的情况。
As far as I can see, the medical system in Wuhan, although under great pressure, has not been out of control.
我们不希望给那些还在隔离的人制造更多的恐慌，否则，就没有办法面对这场灾难了。
We do not want to create more panic among those who are still isolated, otherwise there will be no way to face the disaster.
Yeva ，@武汉市武昌学生，与父亲和叔叔一起居住■1 月 21 日的武汉 图/Yeva我今年 21 岁，在武汉居住了 21 年，虽然我的户籍不是武汉，但我已经相当于是武汉居民了。
Wuhan Hou / Yeva I am 21 years old and have lived in Wuhan. Although my domicile place is not Wuhan, I am already a resident of Wuhan.
我昨天 2:00 才睡，今天是 11:00 醒的。
I only went to bed at 2: 00 yesterday. I woke up at 11: 00 today.
醒了之后，我叔叔让我给我爸爸做饭，因为我爸生病去医院了，于是我 12:00 开始给他做饭。
After waking up, my uncle asked me to cook for my father, who was sick and went to the hospital, so I began to cook for him at 12: 00.
一会儿我爸回来了，一到家就把口罩摘了，我跟他说，「外套要消毒。
After a while my father came home and took off his mask as soon as he got home. I told him, "Sterilize your coat."
」他不肯，说想要先坐一下。
"He would not, and said he would sit down first.
我说，「你刚从医院回来，衣服上面有脏东西，要消毒。
I said, "You just got back from the hospital, you got dirty things on your clothes. Disinfect them."
」他觉得我在嫌弃他，然后就跟我吵了起来，他说，「我都快饿死了，你饭也没做好，就跟我这儿说要消毒。
"He thought I was sick of him, and then he started to argue with me." I'm starving, "he said.
」我说，「我已经在给你做了。
"I said," I'm already doing it for you.
」因为我爸爸的工作是在人流量很大的地方，大概在 19 日那天，我特意跟他打电话嘱咐他，「外面的情况有点严重了，你要把口罩戴上。
"Because my dad's job was in a crowded place, and I called him around the 19th and told him," It's a bit serious out there. You have to put on your mask.
」但是他说，「不行，戴上之后要怎么工作？怎么跟别人交流？别人看到我戴着口罩会怎么想？」等到 22 日的晚上，他突然跟我说，他有点感冒。
"But he said," No, how do you work after you put it on? How do you communicate with people? What do people think when they see me wearing a mask? "He suddenly told me on the evening of the 22nd that he had a cold.
医生说因为不确定到底是不是新型冠状病毒导致的肺炎，就让他在家里休息。
The doctor said he had to rest at home because he was unsure whether it was pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus.
我当时跟他说，「那你不要回我这边了，你回你那边吧。
I said to him, "Then don't come back to me. Go back to you.
」说完我还是不太放心，我很害怕他会直接上来，我就跑去朋友那里住了。
"I was still not sure. I was afraid he would come straight up and I ran to live with my friends.
第二天我还是回来了，我们原本是想 24 日启程回老家，但是因为听说要封城了，就想看看能不能提前走，但是在路上我们又大吵了一架，他又说不走了。
The next day I came back. We wanted to leave home on the 24th, but when we heard that the city would be closed, we wanted to see if we could leave early.
■封城后的隧道 图/Yeva我问过我爸，「你知道现在外面是什么样的状况吗？」他说，「现在这个东西就是比流感要强一点。
I asked my dad, "Do you know what's going on out there?" He said, "It's better than the flu right now.
」我说，「这是强一点吗？已经有很多人被感染了，感染性很强！」然后他又说，「可是你知道那些感染的都是什么人吗？那些重症的都是老年人，青壮年是不会有什么事情的。
I said, "Is that better? Many people are infected and infectious already!" Then he said, "But do you know who those infected are? Those who are seriously ill are old people, and young adults are not going to be anything."
」我告诉他，「现在武汉的医疗已经崩溃了」，但是他依然觉得我是在小题大做。
I told him, "Now Wuhan medical treatment has collapsed," but he still felt I was making a fuss.
我前两天真的特别崩溃，22 日那天，在封城的前一天晚上，已经回了老家的母亲给我打来电话说，「你们不要回来了，你们就在武汉过吧，不要回来了，回来我们也不会见你们的。
I really broke down the other two days, 22, the night before the closure of the city, my mother, who had returned to her hometown, called me and said, "Do not come back, you have been in Wuhan, do not come back, we will not see you.
」我不知道说什么好。
"I don't know what to say.
我爸 22 日晚上打完针，算是退烧了，然后到了 24 日除夕那天，他没有什么症状了。
My father had a fever when he finished his injection on the 22nd, and then on New Year's Eve on the 24th, he had no symptoms.
就在刚刚吃饭的时候，他说他头有点晕，也有点四肢酸痛，但不怎么咳嗽。
Just as he was eating, he said he had a slight dizziness in his head and sore limbs, but not much cough.
■1 月 25 日晚上，Yeva 出门买到了口罩，在超市附近还能看到不少车辆 图/Yeva我不知道未来会发生什么，如果就这样子，消了可能就好了。
On the evening of January 25, Yeva went out and bought a mask, and I could see a lot of cars near the supermarket. / Yeva I don't know what will happen in the future.
但是如果恶化的话，我也不知道该怎么办。
But if it gets worse, I don't know what to do.
应该是要做居家隔离的，可是我发现有很重要的一个问题：外面的药店都已经关门了，如果我想要买药的话，就只能去医院，但是现在医院里面的情况又很严重。
It was supposed to be a home seclusion, but I found a very important problem: the drugstores outside were closed and I had to go to the hospital if I wanted to buy it, but the situation in the hospital was very serious now.
我有一位朋友，他的父亲基本上已经确诊是肺炎了，但是他依然只能在家里隔离。
One of my friends, whose father had been diagnosed with pneumonia, was still confined to his home.
之前他父亲也说自己只是普通感冒，他们一家人在他父亲确诊的前一天还一起吃过饭。
His father had said he had a common cold, and the family had dined the day before his father's diagnosis.
父母的防控意识真的太弱了。
Parental control awareness is really too weak.
我自己的身体，我自己是知道的，今年一直都不太好，所以我很害怕——万一我被传染了的话，我不知道自己能不能撑到那个类似于「小汤山工程」的医院建好。
My own body, as I know, has not been so good this year, so I'm afraid - if I get infected, I don't know if I can make it to the hospital like the "Xiaotangshan Project."
我也不知道如果我父亲的情况恶化了的话，我能怎么办，现在公交都是瘫痪的，我也不会开车，我不知道要怎么把他送到医院。
I don't know what I can do if my father's condition deteriorates. The bus is paralyzed and I can't drive. I don't know how to get him to the hospital.
李博，剪辑师，@武汉市江夏区我叫李博，今天是 2020 年 1 月 25 日大年初一，我在武汉的江夏区。
Li Bo, editor, @ Wuhan Jiangxia District My name is Li Bo, today is January 25, 2020, New Year's Day, I am in Wuhan Jiangxia District.
武汉一直在下雨，最近几天有点冷。
Wuhan has been raining. It has been a bit cold in recent days.
我是辽宁人，去年 8 月份之前一直在北京生活，女朋友本来也在北京工作，但是她由于各种原因就被她爸妈逼回武汉来了。
I am from Liaoning Province. I lived in Beijing until last August and my girlfriend was working in Beijing. But for various reasons, she was forced back to Wuhan by her parents.
因为不想异地，而且我的职业是工作室的剪辑师，可以在家里工作，所以我就过来了。
Because I didn't want to go anywhere, and because I was a studio editor by profession, I could work from home, so I came.
我是为了爱情抛弃了北京，我爸妈在北京我也不要了。
I abandoned Beijing for love's sake, and neither did my parents in Beijing.
我现在自己一个人，是因为我跟她没认识多久，所以她是自己回去跟她家里人一块过节了，现在就很无奈的就剩下我自己了。
I am alone now, because I do not know her long enough, so she is to go home with her family for the holiday, now very helpless only my own.
这个春节，其实我最开始买的票是除夕那天早上到北京的。
In fact, the first ticket I bought for the Spring Festival came to Beijing on New Year's Eve.
我记得情况急转直下好像从 21 日开始。
I remember when things went down like it started on the 21st.
我就是注定走不了的，因为我的票就是 23 日的。
I just can't go because my ticket is on the 23rd.
但是 22 日的时候，我女朋友突然有点感冒，我觉得我可能也有被感染的风险。
But on the 22nd, my girlfriend caught a cold and I thought I might be at risk of getting infected.
当时怕影响爸爸妈妈，我就把票退掉了。
I was afraid to influence my parents, so I returned the ticket.
当时我其实是有一点慌的，我就跟女朋友商量说，你要不要跟你家里人去医院先排查一下。
I was a little nervous then, and I talked to my girlfriend about whether you wanted to check with your family at the hospital.
她跟她家里人当时还在黄石，然后才到了武汉，去了武汉一个不是很大的医院。
She and her family were still in Yellowstone, then to Wuhan, to a hospital is not very large.
那里人也是很多，医生说我女朋友只是有一点点咳嗽，也没有发热，可能是嗓子有点发炎，所以很快就被医生打发回来了。
There are a lot of people there, the doctor said my girlfriend just a little cough, also did not have a fever, may be a sore throat, so soon was sent back by the doctor.
回头看，那个是非常不明智的一个选择。
In retrospect, that was a very unwise choice.
因为有可能在去医院的时候被感染，理论上说他们一家人也是需要隔离的，因为去过医院。
Because it was possible to get infected when they went to the hospital, the family, in theory, also needed to be quarantined because they had been to a hospital.
■竟然看到一个外卖小哥，我很想叫他外卖「大哥」图/李博我现在自己一个人隔离在家，然后带着两只猫，还有一个扫地机器人，这是我们家唯一能动的 4 个东西。
■ I should see a take-out guy, and I'd love to call him "Big Brother" / Lippo. I'm now alone at home with two cats and a sweeper, which is the only thing moving in our family.
腊月二十八那天我去过一次超市，然后就三天没出门。
On the 28th of December I went to the supermarket, and then I stayed out for three days.
昨天晚上，我觉得我的整个人的情绪开始出问题了。
Last night, I felt that something was wrong with my whole person.
我本来就有很长时间的抑郁和焦虑，也看了五年心理医生。
I had been depressed and anxious for a long time, and had seen a psychiatrist for five years.
所以我知道自己是一个比较容易被情绪所影响、性格比较敏感的人。
So I know that I am more easily affected by emotions, more sensitive personality.
有一个心理学的名词，大概就是你刷很多网络上那些创伤性的消息，人会强迫的自己不停的刷，然后很焦虑。
There is a psychological term, that is, you brush a lot of the traumatic news on the network, people will force themselves to brush, and then very anxious.
而且我又是一个人，没什么人说话。
And I'm alone again, and nobody talks.
昨天我跟我的工作伙伴遇到一点问题，我整个人状态就特别不好。
Yesterday I had a problem with my work partner and I was in a particularly bad shape.
晚上的时候，跟我女朋友打电话，聊得也很不好。
At night, I called my girlfriend and had a really bad time talking.
今天早上我就看到有人发心理学的文章，告诉在这个时候大家要重视心理健康的防护。
This morning I saw an article in psychology telling people to pay attention to mental health protection at this time.
所以我从今天早上开始，制定了一个详细的个人作息表。
So I started this morning with a detailed personal schedule.
除了每天做点运动，今天我也人生第一次注册了一个语音直播的账号。
In addition to a daily exercise, today I registered for the first time in my life a live voice account.
我以前从来没用过直播，尝试了几下，虽然也没有什么人看，但也是一个小小的尝试和调剂。
I had never tried it live before and tried it a few times, but it was also a small attempt and a diversion.
我觉得我需要跟人说话，需要跟人交流。
I think I need to talk to people. I need to talk to people.
所以我也许应该把我的朋友分一下类，然后看谁有多余的时间可以分配给我，陪我聊聊天。
So maybe I should sort out my friends and see who has spare time for me to chat with.
■无聊的时候，把家里的日化用品按大小排了序 图/李博明后天我可能去看一下周围的超市是不是还开门，然后补充一点食物。
I might go to the supermarket in the vicinity the day after tomorrow to see if the door is open and a little extra food added.
我现在还不太确定，我家周围的超市具体是怎么样的。
I'm not sure exactly what the supermarkets around my home are like.
因为我腊月二十八那天去了超市，就再也没出门了。
Because I went to the supermarket on the 28th of December and never went out again.
我现在的食物没办法说什么营养均衡，我有很多大米，我的大米能保证我至少饿不死。
I can't say the food is nutritionally balanced, I have a lot of rice, my rice can ensure that I am at least hungry.
蔬菜、蛋白质这些东西，可能就只有几天的补给，明后天或者是过个几天，我就一定是要出去买东西了。
Vegetables, protein, these things, may only be a few days supply, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow or a few days, I must be out shopping.
我早上还跟我的朋友电话，他们都劝我囤一点食品。
I called my friends in the morning and they advised me to hoard some food.
我就觉得说，人流限制没问题，物流应该没有必要限制吧，超市正常还是该进货进货。
I feel that the flow of people is no problem, logistics should not be necessary to limit it, the supermarket is still normal or should buy goods.
但这个只是我自己的判断，我不知道准不准确。
But this is my own judgment. I don't know if it's accurate.
毕竟客观地讲，以这个疫情的严重程度，它可能还会持续很久吧。
After all, objectively speaking, given the magnitude of the epidemic, it is likely to continue for a long time to come.
■小区里的自动售货机还是满的，给人莫名的安全感图/李博L和Black，@武汉市盘龙城经济开发区今天是 2020 年 1 月 25日，我叫 L，现在在武汉的家里，疫情发生以来，我就基本没出过家门，每天能做的就是对着电脑、手机，和两个最亲近的人，在这样的环境下关注着外面所发生的一切。
Today is January 25, 2020, my name is L. Now at my home in Wuhan, all I can do every day is to look at the computer, the mobile phone, and the two closest people, and watch what happens outside.
我叫 Black，L 的未婚夫。
My name is Black L. 's fiance.
本科在湖北读，研究生去了武汉，在武汉生活了好几年。
Undergraduate studies in Hubei, graduate students to Wuhan, living in Wuhan for several years.
女朋友也在武汉。
My girlfriend is in Wuhan, too.
我是在疫情爆发前回了老家，但我女朋友还在武汉。
I returned to my hometown before the outbreak, but my girlfriend is still in Wuhan.
1 月 20 日网上铺天盖地讨论疫情严重性前，武汉人没有那么高的警觉度，我们也是正常生活，准备过年。
Before the spread of the epidemic on the Internet on January 20, Wuhan people are not so vigilant, we are also normal life, ready for the New Year.
那段时间经常吃年饭。
They often had Chinese New Year's Eve meals.
我是 19 日到 22 日和同事一起去重庆旅游。
I went to Chongqing with my colleagues on the 19th and 22nd.
19 日飞过去，20 日早上一睁眼，整个就不一样了。
On the 19th, when I opened my eyes on the 20th morning, the whole thing was different.
手机上所有人都在说武汉肺炎。
Everybody on the cell phone is talking about Wuhan pneumonia.
那天开始，重庆所有人都开始戴口罩了，反而我们两个武汉人没戴口罩，一下子就觉得很可怕，因为作为一个突然置身重庆的武汉人，你不敢说自己是从哪来的。
From that day on, everyone in Chongqing began to wear masks, but we two Wuhan people did not wear masks, immediately feel terrible, because as a sudden in Chongqing Wuhan, you dare not say where you came from.
一次，我们买东西刷会员卡时，店员知道了我们是武汉人，眼神突然就变了。
Once, when we were shopping for a membership card, the clerk realized that we were Wuhan people and the look suddenly changed.
我们发现自己像瘟神一样。
We found ourselves like a plague.
那段时间我们也很密切关注自己，经常摸额头看有没有发热。
At that time we were also very close to ourselves, often touch the forehead to see if there is fever.
22 日那晚飞回来时，已经有很多飞武汉的航班取消。
Many flights to Wuhan had already been canceled by the time they flew back on the 22nd.
幸好我们的航班没事。
Luckily our flight is fine.
到家后就封城了。
When I got home, it was sealed.
特别特别庆幸在这个时候回来了，不然连武汉市都进不了。
Especially lucky to be back at this time, or even Wuhan city can not enter.
我跟她已经谈恋爱 4 年了。
I've been dating her for four years.
我今年 7 月毕业。
I graduated in July this year.
我们准备在毕业后就举办婚礼，按北方习俗，正式婚礼前会有一场订婚宴，我们把这个时间定在 1 月 30 日。
We are going to have a wedding after graduation. According to the northern custom, there will be an engagement party before the wedding.
我们的订婚宴很早以前就定好了，本来大年初三，我和父母都要去内蒙，但因为封城，所有计划都推得推迟。
Our engagement party was arranged a long time ago. My parents and I were going to Inner Mongolia on the third day of the New Year.
我未婚夫比较麻烦，因为订婚是北方习俗，请的都是他们那边的人，所以取消后他们要负责处理的事多一些。
My fiance is a bit of a hassle, because it is a northern custom to hire people from their side, so they have to deal with a lot of things after the cancellation.
其实我们两家在疫情发展时，就担心宾客会不会介意他们是从武汉来的。
In fact, our two families in the development of the epidemic, worried that the guests will not mind that they are from Wuhan.
事实上肯定是会的，怎么可能不会！我当时也在发愁，该怎么办，我就想硬着头皮弄完算了，办完赶紧就回去！但后来疫情严重，如果订婚宴继续，万一有人感染，会很难收场。
I was worried about what to do, and I just wanted to go home as soon as I could, but then the epidemic became so serious that if the engagement continued, it would be very difficult to finish if someone got infected.
我们的想法就是这么跟着疫情发展在变化。
That's how our thinking is changing as the epidemic progresses.
结果武汉封城，这也就不用提什么来不来了。
As a result, Wuhan closed the city, it is not necessary to mention that not come.
我们只能把订婚宴取消，退掉餐厅、物料，再一一通知宾客。
We can only cancel the engagement party, return the restaurant, materials, and notify the guests one by one.
这段时间我只出过两次门。
I've only been out twice this time.
一次是从机场回家第 2 天，我带着父母出去采购，准备买些口罩，结果发现药店根本进不去。
On the second day of my trip home from the airport, I went shopping with my parents to buy some masks and found the drugstore couldn't get in at all.
药店的收银台都排着很长的队伍，每一个武汉人都变得特别神秘，因为都戴着口罩。
Drug stores are lined up at the checkout counter, each Wuhan people have become particularly mysterious, because they are wearing masks.
每个人手上都提着一大袋子药，都不是说一个人去买一两盒，而是买了很多。
Everyone had a big bag of medicine in their hands. It wasn't just that one person bought a box or two, but a lot.
陪我妈去采购时，其实大家都不讲话，埋着头买自己的，互相也尽量避免接触。
Accompanying my mother to go shopping, in fact, we do not speak, buried his head to buy their own, also avoid contact with each other.
我妈说感觉像在闹饥慌，菜场里都在抢。
My mom said it felt like she was starving. It was all in the market.
不知道为什么会突然之间变成这样。
I don't know why this suddenly happened.
最可怕的是，今天下午突然说晚上要封路，限机动车，大家都要疯了。
The worst part is, this afternoon suddenly said to close the road, restricted to motor vehicles, everyone is crazy.
我又带着他们出去买东西，结果这一次想买都买不到了。
I took them out shopping again, and this time I couldn't buy anything.
走了好几个超市，都关门。
Walked several supermarkets, all closed.
每个超市门口都停满了车，大家这个时候已经不管这个地方能不能停车了，甚至都停到马路上了。
Every supermarket door was full of cars, and by this time everyone was regardless of whether the place could stop or even stop on the road.
这个过程中，我们心里是没数的，到底城要封到什么时候，后面会不会所有超市都没得卖，会不会食物不够……根本就考虑不到，目前能想到的就是把米备足，蔬菜尽量充足，水果这些基本就不考虑了。
In this process, we are innumerable, after all the city should be sealed to when, after all all the supermarkets will not be sold, will not be enough food... simply do not take into consideration, at present can think of rice, vegetables as much as possible, fruit these basic do not take into account.
我们好不容易找到一家还开着的麦德龙，门口停满车，蔬菜基本没了，买了两袋米，在面包区域抢了不少回来。
We managed to find a still open Metro, the door full of cars, vegetables are almost gone, bought two bags of rice, in the bread area to rob a lot back.
我其实在想，我有车，还可以去买东西。
I'm actually thinking, I have a car and I can go shopping.
那些没车或者家里环境比较复杂的，甚至于有些空巢老人，他们该怎么度过这个时期？说实话，我觉得现在在这个时期我还是挺需要他的。
How are they going to get through this period without a car or a complex home environment, even some empty nests? To be honest, I think I still need him at this time.
我们两人到要结婚的这段时间，基本上都一直待在一起。
The two of us stayed together until we were about to get married.
然而这个时候，我们反而不在一起。
At this time, however, we are not together.
他也很关注这边的情况，每天都跟我联系，只要是发了我们这边的文件，他会第一时间跟我沟通。
He is also very concerned about this situation, contact me every day, as long as it is our side of the file, he will be the first time to communicate with me.
他也偷偷在内蒙帮我们买口罩，虽然最终还是没过来。
He also secretly helped us to buy masks in Inner Mongolia, although eventually did not come.
但我知道他心里很惦记我。
But I know he misses me.
今天在跟他聊时，他跟我说，只要封城禁令一解除，我会第一时间回去陪她。
Today, while talking to him, he told me that as soon as the city ban was lifted, I would be back with her as soon as it was lifted.
这个时候虽然我们很思念对方，但其实我不太希望他回来，因为很不安全，还是要把自己的身体照顾好。
Although we miss each other at this time, but in fact I do not want him back, because it is not safe, or to take good care of their own body.
久久，武汉人有护士资格证的广告策划今天是 2020 年 1 月 25 日，大年初一。
Long time, Wuhan people have a nurse certificate of advertising planning today is January 25, 2020, New Year's Day.
我和爸妈现在在外地过年。
My parents and I are spending the New Year away.
1 月初的时候武汉出现了一些可疑的肺炎病例，但那个时候是说，「有限人传人」「可防可控」，我们就没在意，也几乎没有人戴口罩。
There were some suspicious cases of pneumonia in Wuhan in early January, but at the time it was said that "human-to-human transmission" was "preventable and controllable." We did not care and few of us wore masks.
1月 20 日这天网络上的新闻从四面八方涌来，各地相继出现了病例，直指病毒是从武汉过去的，那个时候我们才开始感到不对劲。
We began to feel something was amiss when news broke out on the Internet on January 20th, with cases coming from all over the place, pointing to the virus passing from Wuhan.
当天中午我已经买不到口罩了，下班我坐着地铁回家，安检人员完全没有佩戴口罩。
I couldn't buy a mask at noon, so I took the subway home from work, and the security personnel did not wear a mask at all.
地铁上的人非常多，但也没有一个人戴。
There were a lot of people on the subway, but none of them were wearing any.
1月 23 日凌晨，因为放假了，我和朋友在外喝酒，我男朋友突然打电话给我说「武汉要封城了，你快走。
In the early morning of January 23rd, when my friend and I were drinking outside for a holiday, my boyfriend suddenly called me and said, "Wuhan is going to close the city.
」我才意识到这个问题可能已经失控了。
"I realized that the problem might have gotten out of hand.
立刻定了票，清晨带着我爸妈先坐高铁，再坐飞机，离开了武汉。
Tickets were booked immediately. Early in the morning, I took my parents on the high-speed train and left Wuhan by plane.
我知道我这样做非常自私，但作为一个接受过医学常识的人，我知道问题的严重性。
I know I'm very selfish, but as a person with common medical knowledge, I know the magnitude of the problem.
我无法想象如果让我的父母留在这里，万一疫情爆发，我要怎么保护他们，可能连基本的救治都得不到。
I can't imagine what I would do to protect my parents if they were to stay here, and how I would protect them in the event of an outbreak.
一路上，我一直让父母做好防护，注意他们的体温和身体状况，万幸我们三人一直都很健康。
Along the way, I kept my parents well protected, keeping an eye on their temperature and physical condition. Luckily, the three of us were healthy all the time.
但我没有掉以轻心，毕竟还在潜伏期内，到了男朋友家后，我们一直自行隔离。
But I didn't take it lightly. After all, during the incubation period, when we arrived at my boyfriend's house, we remained isolated.
直到昨天，因为我男朋友突发偏头痛，我去给他买了一盒布洛芬，在登记身份证的时候，被发现我是武汉人。
Until yesterday, because my boyfriend had a migraine, I went and bought him a box of ibuprofen. When I checked in, I was found to be Wuhan.
今天疫检中心的人就联系了我们，给我们量体温，也是嘱咐我们要自行隔离。
Today, the people at the quarantine center contacted us, took our temperature, and told us to isolate ourselves.
当然我是绝对不会再出家门了，我不想伤害其他人或者给别人添麻烦。
Of course I will never leave the house again, I do not want to hurt others or cause trouble to others.
我知道网上很多人对「出逃」的人充满了恶意，但假如你的城市也被病毒侵袭了，疾病开始肆虐横行，在没有很好的应对方法的前提下，你不可能不想出去，起码外面比武汉安全。
I know a lot of people on the Internet are full of malice towards those who run away, but if your city is hit by the virus and the disease starts to ravage, you can't avoid going out without a good response, at least outside it is safer than Wuhan.
请理解一个武汉人的恐慌，我很爱我的家乡，很爱那里的人们，但我要保护我和我的家人。
Please understand the fear of a Wuhan people, I love my hometown, love the people there, but I have to protect me and my family.
每天看着屏幕上滚动的新信息，我就非常难过。
I feel very sad when I look at the new information scrolling on the screen every day.
封城后，一切都瘫痪了，听我朋友说，从武昌到汉口的桥上有很多老年人推着个板车，或者骑着自行车过江。
After the city was closed, everything was paralyzed. According to my friend, on the bridge from Wuchang to Hankou there were many old people pushing a rickshaw or riding bicycles across the river.
明天机动车也要限制了，我们到底该怎么办。
Tomorrow the motor vehicles will be restricted. What are we going to do?
我朋友说，武汉已经变成了一座空城，街上一个人也没有，唯一能听到的就是救护车的声音。
My friend said, Wuhan has become an empty city, there is no one in the street, the only hearing is the sound of ambulance.
