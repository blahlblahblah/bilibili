希腊电视里轰炸似的呼吁大家待在家里，和上海说要屏牢有点类似。
Greek television's bombastic call for everyone to stay at home is a bit like the kind of thing Shanghai says about holding a screen.
但自由散漫的民众并不买账，尤其是年轻人，还是该干嘛干嘛。
But the free-wheeling masses don't buy it, especially the young, or do what they should.
说白了，你出不出门，纯粹靠自觉。
To put it bluntly, you don't go out. It's purely conscious.
口述 | 吴女士整理| 金　姬我是80后上海人，因为大学本科学的是西方历史，所以2006年到希腊生活至今。
I come from Shanghai after 80, because university-based science has a history of the West, so I've lived in Greece since 2006.
如今在雅典大学读历史与考古系博士后，并在当地一家私立教育机构兼职教中文。
He now holds a post-doctoral degree in History and Archaeology at Athens University and teaches Chinese part-time at a local private educational institution.
因为希腊没有给华人特别的春节假期，再加上我有课走不开，所以我好多年没有回国过春节了。
Because Greece did not give Chinese people a special Spring Festival, and because I could not leave school, I did not return to China for many years.
平时，我一直很关注国内的新闻。
Normally, I always pay close attention to the news at home.
从去年底曝出武汉华南海鲜市场出现不明原因肺炎开始，我就一直在浏览相关信息。
From the end of last year exposure to Wuhan South China seafood market unknown causes of pneumonia, I have been browsing the relevant information.
欧洲各地狂欢节，可能加速了病毒传播希腊宣布第一例确诊的新冠肺炎病例是在2月26日，在希腊北部最大港口城市及希腊第二大城市塞萨洛尼基，患者为38岁希腊女性，此前曾去过意大利旅行。
Carnival across Europe may have accelerated the spread of the virus Greece announced its first confirmed case of new crown pneumonia on Feb. 26, a 38-year-old Greek woman traveling to Italy in Thessaloniki, Greece's largest port city in northern Greece.
在2月，意大利威尼斯狂欢节，米兰时装周、法国芒通柠檬节和尼斯狂欢节纷纷举行。
In February, the Carnival of Venice, Italy, the Fashion Week of Milan, the French Menton Lemon Festival and the Carnival of Nice took place.
这些活动的举办地基本分布在法国南部与意大利北部交界处，每年都能吸引成千上万的参加者从欧洲各地乃至世界各地汇聚一堂。
These events, which take place largely on the border between southern France and northern Italy, attract thousands of participants from all over Europe and the world every year.
这就为此次新冠肺炎疫情在欧洲的迅速传播提供了温床。
This has provided a breeding ground for the rapid spread of the new crown pneumonia epidemic in Europe.
希腊也有狂欢节——“净周一”（Kathara Deftera）之前的三个星期。
Greece, too, has Carnival, the three weeks preceding "Kathara Deftera."
希腊以每年春分后的第一个满月为基准，其后的第一个星期日为这一年的复活节。
Greece is based on the first full moon after the vernal equinox, followed by Easter on the first Sunday of the year.
复活节这周的星期一叫“圣周一”，而“圣周一”之前的第四十天就是“净周一”。
Easter Monday is "Holy Monday," while "Holy Monday" is preceded by "Clean Monday."
今年的净周一是3月2日，所以今年2月10日开始，希腊人就在过狂欢节了。
The net Monday this year is March 2, so the Greeks are having Carnival from February 10 this year.
按照惯例， “净周一”前的那个星期日是狂欢节的高潮和最亮点。
As is customary, the Sunday before Net Monday was the highlight and highlight of Carnival.
这一天，人们可以尽情地吃喝玩乐，男女老幼穿上各种稀奇古怪的衣服，狂欢直至深夜。
On this day, people can eat, drink and play, men, women and children put on a variety of strange clothes, revelry into the night.
每年在希腊各个城市都要举办盛大的狂欢游行，载歌载舞。
Every year in every Greek city to hold a grand carnival parade, singing and dancing.
希腊往年的狂欢节但是今年突如其来的疫情，政府宣布狂欢节庆典活动取消了……3月5日至今，确诊人数每天两位数增长在中国刚开始发生新冠疫情时，可能是因为中希两国关系很好，希腊媒体报道很客观。
Greek carnivals in previous years but this year the government announced the cancellation of Carnival celebrations... From March 5 to the present, double-digit daily growth in the number of confirmed cases may be due to the good bilateral relations between China and Greece and the objectivity of Greek media reports.
希腊官员也在力挺中国，希腊华人华侨还募集了一些防护物资寄回国内。
Greek officials have also been campaigning for China, and some Chinese Greeks have collected protective goods to send back home.
希腊老百姓对中国人也很友好。
Ordinary Greeks are also friendly to the Chinese.
希腊大约有1100万人口，首都雅典大概就有400多万人。
Greece has a population of about 11 million, and Athens, the capital, has about 4 million people.
雅典是一座旅游城市，疫情暴发期间，看到中国游客可能会敬而远之，但这也是人之常情，并没有什么歧视或者排华的意思。
Athens is a tourist city, during the outbreak of the outbreak, to see Chinese tourists may shy away, but this is also human nature, there is no discrimination or exclusion.
第一例确诊病例公布后，第二天超市人流明显增加，大米和意大利面等粮食最受欢迎，但并没有卖空。
The next day saw a marked increase in supermarket traffic following the announcement of the first confirmed case, with grains such as rice and spaghetti most popular but not short-selling.
后来大家也就习惯了，虽然隔三岔五会有新的确诊病例，但一直没有出现抢购狂潮。
Later we got used to it. Although there were new confirmed cases every three minutes, there was no rush.
拐点大概发生在3月5日，这一天开始，希腊每天新增确诊病例保持在两位数了。
The inflection point occurred on March 5, when the number of newly diagnosed cases in Greece remained at double digits every day.
大家才开始有点紧张起来。
It's just starting to get a little nervous.
到了3月10日，希腊政府宣布学校关闭2周，这下人们真的感到事态有些严重了。
By March 10, the Greek government had declared the school closed for two weeks, and there was a real sense that things were getting serious.
雅典，一家因为疫情而暂时关闭的公立学校 供图 |受访者因为仅仅停课2周，所以所有公立学校都没有在线上课。
AT & # 45; AT & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; Athens, a public school that was temporarily closed because of the epidemic.
我8岁儿子所在的公立小学，老师只是建了一个家长群，发一些链接在里面，让小朋友有空自己看看书。
In my 8-year-old son's public primary school, the teacher just built a group of parents, send some links inside, let children read their own free time.
我4岁女儿所在的公立幼儿园，老师每周会和孩子通个视频电话，了解一下情况，仅此而已。
At my 4-year-old daughter's public kindergarten, the teacher calls her children weekly by video phone, and that's all.
希腊人熟人见面之间会行贴面礼。
Greek acquaintances meet each other with a veneer.
但这次疫情期间，这样的传统仪式也能省则省了。
But during the outbreak, such traditional rituals could have been saved.
我有时带着一双儿女在家附近溜达，遇到他们同学及其家长，也只能远远点头致意，偶尔寒暄几句。
Sometimes I take a pair of children stroll around the house, met their classmates and their parents, can only far nod greetings, occasional greeting.
虽然病毒没有隔绝爱，但主动让大家刻意保持距离，这实在让人五味杂陈。
Although the virus does not isolate love, but the initiative to keep everyone deliberately distance, this is really mixed.
疫情对我的影响比较有限，我所在的私立培训机构可以继续上网课。
The epidemic has had a limited impact on me, and my private training institute is able to continue taking classes online.
吴女士在给学生在线教中文 供图|受访者休闲娱乐场所全关闭，消毒液限购3月13日，为阻止病毒进一步传播，希腊政府宣布将关闭商场、咖啡店和酒吧，但超市和药店会继续营业。
Ms Wu is teaching Chinese online to students. & # 160; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45
到了第二天（3月14日），希腊电视里轰炸似的呼吁大家待在家里，和上海说要屏牢有点类似。
By the next day (March 14), Greek television was bombarded with appeals to stay at home, a bit like Shanghai saying it was time to clam up.
但自由散漫的民众并不买账，尤其是年轻人，还是该干嘛干嘛。
But the free-wheeling masses don't buy it, especially the young, or do what they should.
毕竟地中海气候的希腊，如今真是景色最宜人之际，窝在家里实在有些辜负了满城春色。
After all, Greece, with its Mediterranean climate, is one of the most pleasant places in the world.
而且，希腊当地的房屋多以独门独户或者街面房为主，没有像国内的街道居委这样的组织，所以也不太可能像中国这样严格管理。
Moreover, the majority of Greek homes to single-family or street rooms, there is no such organization as the domestic neighborhood committee, so it is unlikely that such strict management as China.
说白了，你出不出门，纯粹靠自觉。
To put it bluntly, you don't go out. It's purely conscious.
雅典的一条商业街供图|受访者在希腊，因为此前的流感，口罩愈来愈难买到。
A commercial street in Athens was with AT & # 44; # 124; interviewees in Greece, where masks were becoming increasingly difficult to buy because of the flu.
即便买到口罩，和欧洲人一样，希腊人也不习惯戴口罩。
Even if they buy masks, Greeks, like Europeans, are not used to wearing them.
雅典北郊一处地铁站外，疫情使得人流量大幅减少，但戴口罩的人凤毛麟角供图|受访者可以随身携带的免洗消毒液和酒精消毒纸也很紧张。
Outside a subway station on the northern outskirts of Athens, the epidemic has caused a drop in traffic, but few masks were worn by anyone at all. Respondents were also nervous about the disposable disinfectant and alcohol disinfectant paper with them.
我去药店购买的时候，被告知每次只能进两个顾客。
When I went to the drugstore, I was told that I could only enter two customers at a time.
雅典的一家药店门口，贴着有关新冠病毒的宣传资料而且，购买的消毒液是药店自己配制的，每人也只能限购两瓶。
At the entrance to a pharmacy in Athens, information about the new cap virus was posted and only two bottles were allowed per person, as the disinfectant was prepared by the drugstore itself.
不过，超市里的家庭防护用品供应倒很充裕。
However, the supply of household protective equipment in supermarkets is abundant.
就是你要彻底清洁房屋，各种物品都很齐全。
You have to clean your house thoroughly. Everything is in order.
在雅典，超市里的一次性手套和家用清洁用品供应充足供图|受访者截至3月15日，希腊全国确诊病例228例，这在欧洲并不算严重。
In Athens, the supply of disposable gloves and household cleaning products at the supermarket was adequate. As of March 15, 228 cases had been confirmed nationwide in Greece, not too serious in Europe.
希腊目前的三例死亡病例都是老人。
Three of the current deaths in Greece are old people.
普通人如果怀疑自己有问题，可以申请做新冠病毒检测，确诊后也可以去医院治疗，这些都是免费的。
Ordinary people who suspect that they have a problem can apply for a new crown virus test, after diagnosis can also go to hospital treatment, these are free of charge.
在我看来，此次新冠肺炎疫情全球大暴发，不能归罪于某个国家、某座城市或者某些个人。
In my view, this global outbreak of pneumonia cannot be blamed on any country, city or individuals.
当然，政府如果一开始不够重视，的确需要承担一定责任，比如英国政府太放任。
Of course, the government does bear some responsibility if it doesn't pay enough attention at first, for example, the British government is too laissez-faire.
当下，如果病毒在各国之间畅通无阻，更需要世界各国联合起来共同抗疫。
Now, if the virus goes unchecked between countries, the world needs to join forces to fight the disease.
