这是大宝跟着小慧的第三年，三年内他们最长只分开过7天，而这回，从15号开始，至今小慧已经有快整整一个月了没见到大宝了。
This was the third year that Dabao had followed Xiao Hui. In three years, they had been separated for only seven days. This time, from the 15th onwards, Xiao Hui had not seen Dabao for almost a whole month.
宠物店主豆豆让小慧和大宝视频，手机里的大宝一如以前的沉默，表情温顺，只不过一天比一天瘦了下去。
Pet shopkeeper Doudou let Xiaohui and Dabao video, mobile phone like the previous silence, the expression is docile, but day by day less and less.
疫情还在扩散，分离眼见还要持续下去，小慧最担忧的，是大宝会觉得她不要它了。
The spread of the epidemic, separation will continue to see, Xiaohui is most worried that the big Po will feel that she did not want it.
1月31号，“宠物会传染冠状病毒”的谣言传出，人的恐慌转移到动物身上，弃养和残忍捕杀现象呈倍数增长。
On January 31, rumors spread that pets could infect coronavirus. Fear shifted to animals, and abandonment and cruel hunting increased exponentially.
虽然随后谣言被破除，然而紧接着的封城，让被迫留守空城的动物面临着更大面积的断粮断水。
Though rumors were later cleared, the ensuing closures left the animals forced to stay in the city facing a larger area of food and water deprivation.
它们和我们一样，都不能真正远离这场风雨旋涡之外。
They, like us, cannot really stay out of the vortex of this storm.
弃猫效应一月中旬，小慧去西藏旅游，她把大宝寄养在武汉一家宠物店内，离开前告诉它，自己一月底就会回去。
In mid-January, Xiao Hui went on a trip to Tibet. She placed Taobao in a Wuhan pet store and told her before she left that she would be back by the end of January.
疫情的突然爆发无缝贴合春节，封城、隔离接踵而至，计划被猝不及防地打断，很多人被迫与家乡、亲人和宠物隔离，小慧也只好先回了贵州老家。
The outbreak of the outbreak seamlessly coincided with the Spring Festival, the closure and isolation followed, the plan was interrupted unexpectedly and many people were forced to isolate themselves from their homes, relatives and pets.
大宝是一只“超级没有安全感”的拉布，足足有六十多斤，是豆豆收养的宠物里唯一一只大型犬。
Dabao is a "super insecure" Rabbo, full of more than 60 jin, is the only large-scale pet beans adopted in the large dog.
小慧还记得，三年前她把大宝带回家时，它极度怕生，抱回家也不叫，不乱跑，相比起爱吵闹的狗来说，它更像一只性格文静的猫。
Little Hui remembered that when she brought him home three years ago, he was extremely afraid of life, didn't bark, didn't run, and was more like a quiet cat than a noisy dog.
大宝是一只六十多斤的拉布，也是小胡店里目前收养的“最大号”（图/受访者提供）它的前主人忙于工作无心照顾，只得“遗弃”。
Dabao is a sixty-pound Rabbo, and the "largest" (photo / interviewee) currently adopted by the store. Its former owner was too busy with his work to take care of him and had to "abandon" him.
遗弃给狗造成了某种后遗症，和小慧在一起时，每次带它出去玩，只要一分钟没看到小慧，大宝就会疯了似地满世界找她，偶尔回家晚，它也会一直等着小慧回来，看着她睡下之后自己才去睡，“永远在我睡着之后再睡，醒来之前先醒。
When he was with him, he would go out and play with him every time. If he didn't see Xiaohui for a minute, he would crawl around the world looking for her. Once in a while, he would come home late.
”小慧记得一次同学聚会，她带大宝回老家，拜托姑姑暂时照顾它一下，半夜，姑姑一个电话打过来，让她赶紧回去，大宝看不见她，一直在哭。
"Xiao Hui remembered a class reunion. She took Dabao home with her and asked her aunt to take care of him for a while.
和小慧一样，大多数寄养人都没想到有今天这个状况。
Like Xiaohui, most foster parents did not expect this to happen today.
1月20号还没封城的时候，思凡从武汉回老家江西，离开之前，思凡把她仅有两个月大的狸花猫布丁交给宠物店，春节期间每天40寄养费，过后是每天30。
Before returning to his hometown of Jiangxi on January 20th, Swan handed over her two-month-old civet pudding to a pet shop, 40 foster care fees a day during the Spring Festival and 30 days later.
思凡预计10天后就能回来，10天还没过完一半，就回不去了。
Stefan expects to be back in 10 days, and before he's halfway through, he can't go back.
思凡养的狸花猫布丁（图/受访者提供）小慧、思凡，宠物主人们最大的担忧差不多：害怕“毛孩子”们误以为自己被抛弃了而产生抑郁倾向，尤其是那些曾被抛弃过一次的猫狗，会表现出比人类更加不耐烦的焦虑和恐慌，也就是所谓“弃猫效应”。
Swan's Pudding (Photo / Interviewee) Little Hui, Sifan, Pet Owners share the biggest concern: Fear of depression among "hairy children," who mistakenly believe they have been abandoned, especially those who have been abandoned once, show more impatience and panic than humans, the so-called "cat-throwing effect."
布丁就是思凡捡来的。
The pudding was picked up by Sphin.
2017年春天一个雨夜，她在下班回家的路边草丛里听见细弱的猫叫，奶声奶气的像个婴儿，她被吸引过去，看到一只刚出生没多久的田园猫，浑身漉湿，约十米处也窸窣传来同样的声音，她摸寻到一处楼脚，一只比提醒更瘦弱的猫卡在了防盗网里。
On a rainy spring night in 2017, she heard a feeble cat barking in the grass on her way home from work, suckling like a baby. She was attracted by the sound of a little-born farm cat, wet and rustling at about ten metres, and felt for the foot of a building where a cat got stuck in a burglar-proof net.
思凡猜测这三只猫来自同一窝，索性一块儿收留了，从来没养过猫的她成为了一个越来越专业的铲屎官。
Stefan guessed that the three cats came from the same litter and took in together. Having never owned a cat, she became an increasingly professional shovel.
思凡是一名律师，养三只会有些力不从心，后来，她将其中两只寄养给了别人，自己留下了布丁。
Si General a lawyer, raising three will be a bit out of the heart, later, she gave two foster care to others, left their own pudding.
图/受访者提供她从前有过帮别人照看宠物的经历，与其说是“照看”，不如说是“拯救”。
Photo / interviewee gives an account of her past experience caring for other people's pets. It was more about "rescue" than "care."
那时她还在住出租房，一间五居室的主卧，阳台与隔壁户主是连通的，但中间隔了一道常闭玻璃门。
She was still in a rented room, a five-bedroom master bedroom with a balcony connected to the next-door occupant, but with a usually closed glass door.
一次隔壁户主出差几天，他养的小泰迪自己溜达到了阳台窗口边。
On a few days' business trip next door, his little Teddy slipped up to the balcony window.
主人在客厅安置的摄像头里看到了这一幕，心立马就悬起来了。
The host sees this scene in the camera that the living room installs, the heart immediately hangs up.
他通过当时也在外地的房东找到思凡，请了开锁匠将阳台门撬开，再把泰迪抱进她屋内。
He found Stefan through his landlord, who was also out of town, and asked the locksmith to pry the balcony open and carry Teddy into her house.
接下来那几天，思凡都在照看着那只泰迪，几天后，她第一次对养宠物产生了兴趣。
For the next few days, Ivan watched over the Teddy, and a few days later, for the first time, she became interested in pets.
而有了自己的布丁后，为了防止类似事件发生，无论去哪她都更宁愿花钱寄养在宠物店，而不是锁在家中。
And with her pudding, she would rather spend money in a pet shop than lock up at home to prevent a similar event.
颇有胜利感的骄傲小胡和男友的宠物店开在武汉一个小区里，从一月初到现在，不足30平米的店共收养了11只狗和13只猫，收养费从30/天到70/天不等。
Hu and his boyfriend's pet store in a Wuhan neighborhood have adopted 11 dogs and 13 cats in less than 30 square meters since early January, with adoption fees ranging from 30 days to 70 days.
大多都来自熟悉的客户，还不算几位店员自己的。
Most come from familiar customers, not to mention a few clerks' own.
很多主人不放心寄养在别人家，关在家里更不行，寄养的话，至少每天能知晓宠物们的情况。
Many owners do not trust foster care in other people's homes, even worse, foster care, at least daily can know about the pet.
店老板小胡身兼数职：铲屎官，衣食父母，重度疫区中心的逆行者。
Store owner Xiaohu several functions: shovel excrement official, food and clothing parents, severe epidemic area center of the inverse.
在疫情结束之前，把托付给他们的猫狗们毫发无损地还回去，是一种颇有胜利感的骄傲。
It was a triumphant pride to return the dogs and cats entrusted to them unscathed before the end of the epidemic.
至少在疫情期间，她和一起开店的男友不指望靠收养赚钱了，两人每天要全副武装地花5-6个小时去店里消毒，喂食，从年三十至今耗费掉他们近80只口罩，40多双手套。
At least during the epidemic, she and her boyfriend didn't expect to make money from adoption, spending five to six hours a day disinfecting and feeding them armed, consuming nearly 80 masks and more than 40 pairs of hands from their thirties to the present.
一次性手套每天都要换，不到半个月就费掉了40多双（图/受访者提供）后期疫情愈发凶猛，他们相继拒绝了20多位寄养申请。
Disposable gloves change every day, spending more than 40 pairs in less than half a month (photo / interviewees provide). They turned down more than 20 foster care applications.
宠物店所在的洪山区也算全市疫区中心了。
The Hongshan area where pet shop is located is also the center of the whole city epidemic area.
每天硬着头皮踏出家门，走一小段路到小区，算一种冒险。
Every day bravely step out of the house, a short walk to the community, is a kind of adventure.
宠物主子们这些天里突然变得异常关心小胡，一天三问，小区有点什么风吹草动立马提醒她小心。
Pet owners have suddenly become very concerned about Hu these days, three times a day, the community what the wind immediately reminded her to be careful.
“要不是都答应好了，这两天实在是不想出门。
'If not all had agreed, I should not have gone out these two days.
现在她成了宠物们唯一的依靠，猫咪狗子们成了她的小祖宗。
Now she was the only support for her pets, and the cats and dogs became her little forefathers.
”这段日子，小胡每天早上11点左右出现在店里，第一步骤是带宠物们上厕所，因为空间有限，只能将一间可以紫外线消毒的美容室里暂作卫生间，一只完毕后要先给房间消毒再带下一只进来。
The first step is to take the animals to the toilet, which is limited and can only be used as a toilet in a ultraviolet-disinfecting beauty parlor.
接下来是清洗托盘、笼窝，一个个吃饭加水，光是喷消毒水的程序每天就要操作不下五十次。
Next is to wash the tray, cage, one by one to add water, simply spray disinfectant procedures have to operate no less than 50 times a day.
从交通管制到封城、封闭小区，室外遛狗不再可行。
From traffic control to closed cities and neighborhoods, outdoor walking of dogs is no longer feasible.
到2月初过完大年时，整个湖北已经被全国快递隔绝了，大宝和其它“毛孩子”们面临断粮危机。
By the end of the Lunar New Year in early February, Hubei had been cut off by couriers nationwide, and Dabao and other "Mao children" were facing a food crisis.
小胡找同行高价调了两次贷，自己掏运费，终于联系到了可以运送到小区门口的粮源，用货拉拉送过来。
Xiao Hu asked his peers to borrow twice at his own expense and finally got in touch with the food supply that could be delivered to the front of the community.
小胡让小慧每天和大宝视频，视频里的大宝比半个月前瘦了不少，有些无精打采。
Xiaohui let Xiaohui every day and Taobao video, video of the big Bao than half a month ago lost a lot of weight, some listless.
它的活动范围每天仅限于宠物店内不到30平米的室内，从前好不容易教会宠物们只在室外拉屎拉尿，现在又要反教回来。
Its range of activities is limited to less than 30 square metres of indoor pet shop, previously hard to teach pets only to excrement outside, and now back again.
一只幼年金毛把自己憋在笼子里瑟瑟发抖，不吃不喝也不睡觉，小胡小心翼翼地在微信上给他主人发照片，模样实在让人头疼。
When a young golden retriever shakes himself in a cage and doesn't eat, drink or sleep, Hu looks like a pain in the neck as he carefully posts photographs of his master.
7号晚上，一个顾客拜托小胡上门去她家中喂一次猫咪，她的两只猫已经被单独关在家里十多天了。
On the evening of the 7th, a customer asked Hu to come to her house to feed her cat. Her two cats had been kept alone at home for more than ten days.
小胡起初有些忐忑，她知道对方所在的那栋楼已有两位确诊患者。
Hu at first a little perturbed, she knew that the other side of the building has two confirmed patients.
但看着主人心急如焚，她知道的确是别无他法了，总不能放着两只猫咪饿死在家。
But as she watched her master burn, she knew that there was no other way. Two cats could not die of starvation.
上门喂猫的工作人员（图/红星视频）打开对方家门，一股浓重的味道扑鼻而来，客厅地板稀稀拉拉的黄褐色水渍，电视柜、衣橱和书桌无一幸免，卫生间和厨房更是惨不忍睹。
Cat-door feeding staff (photo / red star video) opened the door of the other side, a strong smell came, the living room floor sparse yellow-brown water stains, television cabinets, wardrobes and desks, particularly in toilets and kitchens.
主卧床上都铺满了猫的排泄物。
The master's bed was covered with cat excrement.
找了足足半小时，小胡才在床角发现了两只蜷缩的小东西。
After searching for half an hour, Hu found two small things curled up in the corner of the bed.
她一次性准备了一个多月的水和粮食，从那栋楼里溜出来，哭笑不得地告诉主人，不会再去第二次了。
She had prepared water and food for more than a month at a time, slipped out of the building and told her master, weeping and laughing, that she would not go there a second time.
也有的代养店主在疫区冒着风险天天照顾宠物，却突然联系不上主人了。
There are also surrogate owners in the affected areas at risk of daily pet care, but suddenly unable to contact the owner.
当李函连续三天给一只狸花猫的主人发信息没得到回复后，他明白了，这只可怜的小家伙被遗弃了。
When Li failed to respond to a three-day message to the cat's owner, he understood that the poor creature had been abandoned.
他的店开在武汉市江汉区，目前收养了超过三十只猫狗。
His shop is in Jianghan district of Wuhan and has adopted more than 30 cats and dogs.
主人们忧心忡忡是必然的，每天他都要花至少三个小时和远在他乡的客户线上沟通。
The main worry was inevitable, and every day he spent at least three hours communicating with customers far away.
图/受访者提供那只狸花猫被他发到对话框里，图片、视频都显示其一天比一天瘦，“不是亲生的看了都心疼。
Photo / interviewee shows the beaver cat in the dialog box. Pictures and videos show it getting thinner every day.
”第四天“弹尽粮绝”，他硬着头皮再去找它的主人，发现自己已经被对方删了。
On the fourth day, when he had "run out of food and drink," he went to his master and found himself cut off.
李函别无他法，只好暂时挪用其他宠物主人买的猫粮喂养那只狸花，自己再赶紧想办法进货。
Li letter has no other choice but to temporarily divert the cat food that other pet owner buys to feed that nutria, oneself hasten to think to buy stock again.
穿梭在外面凄凉的街道上，他竟不知道该庆幸还是愤怒：在这种非常时期，遗忘和遗弃，到底有没有区别？他不知道，但已经做下决定，等疫情过去，自己就收养那只可怜的狸花。
He wandered through the dreary streets without knowing whether to congratulate himself or to be angry: was there any difference between forgetfulness and abandonment in such an eventuality? He did not know, but he had made up his mind to adopt the poor nutria when the epidemic was over.
被滞留的牵挂作为人口高度流通的中心，北京是率先进行小区封闭管理的第一批城市。
As the center of high population circulation, Beijing was the first city to carry out the closed management of small area.
在容纳了近30万外来务工者的天通苑里，阿杜在其中的东三旗某社区住了五六年，橘猫豆豆跟着他也有两年了。
In The Chantong Yuan, home to nearly 300,000 migrant workers, Adu has lived in a neighborhood of the East Sanqi for five or six years, and Orange Peas has been with him for two years.
回山东老家过年后没几天，东三旗不少社区相继“封村”，村委会告诉租客，从外地返回北京的要么联系房东签订“隔离协议”，要么自觉在宾馆酒店居住十四天。
A few days after the Chinese New Year came back to Shandong Province, many communities in the eastern three flags closed down their villages. Villagers were told by the village committee that those who returned to Beijing from other places should either contact the landlord to sign a "separation agreement" or consciously stay in the hotel for 14 days.
在镜头前呼唤主人的留守小猫房东口径不一，租客们的怨声一片传到还未返京者耳中，阿杜知道自己暂时回不去了，但豆豆还在家中。
Call the owner in front of the camera called the owner of the kitten landlords vary, the tenant's complaints spread to the ears of those who have not returned to Beijing, Adu knew he could not go back temporarily, but the beans are still at home.
头两天，他有一种“智能喂猫机”，用无线网和固定摄像头就可以达成远程监控和喂养。
For the first two days, he had a "smart cat feeder" that could be remotely monitored and fed by wireless networks and fixed cameras.
十多天过去，荧幕里的豆豆开始时隐时现，经常消失一天半天，出现在镜头前也是一张萎靡不振的猫脸，年轻的小伙子猫快要变成老公公了。
More than 10 days later, the screen bean began to disappearing, often disappeared for half a day, appeared in front of the camera is also a depressed cat face, the young man cat is about to become an old father-in-law.
阿杜只得求助房东，软磨硬泡好半天，才说服房东帮他进家照看一次豆豆。
Adu had to resort to the landlord, soft and hard-boiled for a long time before persuading the landlord to help him look after beans in his home.
他只想确认它有没有生病，“至于有没有怀疑我把它遗弃了，等我回去再好好向它解释吧。
He only wanted to make sure that he was not ill. As to whether he suspected me of abandoning it, I will explain it to him when I return.
”年后，各省一些线上动物援助组织开始搭建一对一帮扶平台，让留在本城的人帮助照看暂时无主的宠物。
Some online animal-aid organizations in the provinces began building one-on-one support platforms for people left in the city to help take care of temporarily orphaned pets.
武汉市小动物保护协会搜集的帮扶求助名单在找到人帮忙上自己家投喂时，王果没有一天没在焦虑：扎扎不会饿死吧？王果把扎扎单独放在哈尔滨家中快20天了。
When he found someone to help him feed his family, Wang didn't worry every day: Zaza didn't starve, did he? Wang put Zazha in Harbin alone for nearly 20 days.
2月6号，辗转三番后终于回到家时，扎扎一反常态变得食欲不振，精神萎靡，最喜欢的小零食也不搭理了。
On February 6, when he finally returned home after a three-to- one run, Zaza became unusually hungry, spiritless, and ignored his favorite snack.
叫唤的声音从“喵喵”变成了“嗷嗷”。
The cry changed from "meow" to "whine."
王果想起那天离家时，扎扎正在她面前低头吃东西，一抬头，主人就不见了。
When Wang Guo thought of leaving home that day, Zazha was in front of her head to eat, one looked up, the host disappeared.
这次回家后，它好像不大再敢一直低头吃东西了，吃几口就瘫软下来，巴巴地望着她。
When he got home, he didn't seem to dare to keep his head down to eat, so he sank down and looked at her.
扎扎是一只不到两岁的英短蓝，也是王果长到23岁正儿八经养的第一只宠物。
Zaza is an English-short blue under two years of age and Wang Guo is the first 23-year-old pet.
吃得多，睡得死，喜欢陪伴，却不喜欢被摸、抱、揉。
Eat more, sleep dead, like to accompany, but do not like to be touched, hug, knead.
刚领回家时，王果还以为这是只哑巴猫。
When he first took it home, Wang Guo thought it was a dumb cat.
英短蓝猫扎扎（图/受访者提供）19号回省内老家宝清前，她给扎扎准备了两盆粮，按照往常情况，这些足够它吃五天。
Before returning to her hometown of Baoqing in the province on February 19, she prepared two pots of grain for Zaza, which would normally last five days.
谁知离开后还不到5天，全国就突然拉响疫情警报，宝清乡区开始封路，原计划大年初六回去的路程被阻隔了。
However, less than five days after leaving, the whole country suddenly sounded the epidemic alert, Bao Qingxiang District began to block the road, originally planned to return on the sixth day of the year was blocked.
2月2号，老家要封城的传言流散开来，紧接着，哈尔滨街道小区也开始陆续封闭了。
On February 2, rumors spread that the city would be closed, and then the Harbin neighborhood began to close.
王果慌了，告诉家人想当晚坐火车回去。
Wang Kuo panicked and told his family he wanted to go back by train that night.
爸妈阻止她：我们就你一个，出事了怎么办？那天，王果和家人大吵一架。
Mom and Dad stopped her: We just one of you, what happened? That day, Wang Guo and his family quarreled.
心烦意乱的时候，王果在网上疯狂搜找能发货的猫粮，再想方设法托人给送过去。
When upset, Wang Guo frantically search the Internet can deliver cat food, and then find ways to send them.
平时扎扎常吃的粮牌500一袋，她觉得怪对不起扎扎的，一咬牙给它买了平时舍不得下单的一种品牌，700块一袋。
Zazha usually eat food brand 500 a bag, she felt sorry for Zaza, a bite to its teeth to buy a normal order of a brand, 700 yuan a bag.
图/受访者提供捱到刚过完元宵节，王果想出一条绕路：搭车到省北部佳木斯坐两小时高铁回去，这条路比直线路程足足远了一倍还多。
picture / interviewee provide... until just after the Lantern Festival, wang Guo came up with a roundabout way: hitchhiked to Jiamusi in the north of the province for a two-hour high-speed train ride, which is more than twice the distance.
她前脚刚离开，第二天老家就封城了。
She had just left her front foot, and her hometown was sealed the next day.
出不来，进不去。
No way out, no way in.
这场抗疫硬战还不知道要打多久，这些天来我们见证了太多生离和死别，动物对人的眷恋和信任也许是一道最稳定的城墙。
We have seen too much separation and death these days. Animal attachment and trust may be the most stable wall.
所有的生命都会渴望被爱、被牵挂，也许就像电影《忠犬八公》里那句台词：“生与死的距离，对于一条狗来说，它无法参透，它只相信，他的主人会回来。
All life is yearning to be loved and cared for, perhaps as the line in the movie "The Duchess of Loyalty" says: "The distance between life and death is too great for a dog to see.
