目前特朗普政府的公信力受到考验如何在避免大众恐慌和提供关键信息并做出果断回应之间努力寻求有效的平衡将是媒体和大众聚焦的问题3月4日，美国纽约，部分乘客戴口罩乘坐地铁。
The credibility of the current Trump administration will be tested by efforts to find an effective balance between averting mass panic and providing critical information and a decisive response.
图/新华在纽约我为什么戴口罩?文/刘裘蒂发于2020.3.16总第939期《中国新闻周刊》自1月20日第一例确诊病例在华盛顿州出现后，美国的新冠病例以缓慢的速度增加。
Photo / Xinhua Why Do I Wear a Mask in New York? Wen / Jude Liu appears in 2020.3.16, issue 939 of China News Weekly. Since the first confirmed case appeared in Washington State on January 20th, the number of new cases in the United States has been increasing at a slow rate.
到了2月29日只有24例， 除了少数输入型感染，大部分是从钻石公主号邮轮和武汉撤侨而来的。
By February 29, there were only 24 cases, most of them from the Princess Diamond and Wuhan, except for a few imported infections.
但从3月1日开始，由于华盛顿州一家老人照护中心疫情暴发，以及北加州出现查不出传染源的社区感染，数字随之急剧增加。
But since March 1, the number has risen sharply as a result of an outbreak at a care center for the elderly in Washington state and the emergence of community infections in northern California where no source of infection can be detected.
随着病毒采检范围扩大，估计数字在短期内将会激增。
It is estimated that the number will soar in the short term as virus collection expands.
美国虽然有先进的医疗设施，但是根据武汉的经验，当大量患者涌入时，大部分医疗机构都有可能崩溃。
Although the United States has advanced medical facilities, in Wuhan's experience, most medical institutions can collapse when large numbers of patients arrive.
在事态似乎越来越紧张的时刻，我开始盘点手边攒的口罩。
At a time when things seemed increasingly tense, I started taking stock of the masks I had saved at hand.
美国医事总署署长杰罗姆·亚当斯让大众停止购买口罩来预防新型冠状病毒，因为如果口罩佩戴不当，实际上可能增加感染的风险。
U.S. Medical Director Jerome Adams asked the public to stop buying masks to prevent the new coronavirus, which could actually increase the risk of infection if worn improperly.
对我来说，这就像是说，如果在汽车里安全带系法不正确的话，有可能还会造成伤害，那么就不系安全带吗?如果搭乘快艇时救生衣穿着不正确，反而会出事，那就不穿救生衣吗?美国抗疫总是慢半拍美国的种种表现显示，其抗疫策略似乎总是慢了半拍。
To me, it's like saying that if the seatbelt system in a car is not right and there is a possibility of further injury, don't you fasten your seat belt? If you wear your life jacket incorrectly in a speedboat, you don't wear a life jacket.
为什么慢半拍?我认为有几点因素。
Why do you slow down? I think there are several factors.
武汉封城后，当中国媒体关于疫情的报道铺天盖地之际，特朗普弹劾案在美国参议院受审，美国主流媒体每天的头条都是弹劾案，而对于疫情的报道并不详细。
After the closure of Wuhan, when China's media reported an impeachment of Trump in the US Senate, the US mainstream media made a daily headline of impeachment, and coverage of the epidemic was not detailed.
特朗普在1月31日宣布自美东时间2月2日下午5时起禁止中国人入境，并要求从中国来的美国公民和永久居民进行14天的隔离。
Trump announced on January 31 that Chinese citizens would be barred from entering the country from 5 p.m. on February 2, East Time, and that US citizens and permanent residents from China would be quarantined for 14 days.
但是“封关”造成的心理错觉是，病毒是一个“遥远的现象”，给医护人员和大众带来虚假的“安全感”。
But the psychological delusion created by "containment" is that the virus is a "distant phenomenon," inflicting a false "sense of security" on health-care workers and the general public.
一旦疫情向其他国家扩散，便到了防不胜防的地步。
Once the epidemic spreads to other countries, it becomes unstoppable.
而在此次疫情降临美国本土之前，华人社团和个人为了支援母国，已经掏空了美国的口罩市场。
Before the outbreak hit mainland China, Chinese communities and individuals had hollowed out the US market for masks in support of their home countries.
其实我认为，在美国“封关”之前，有可能的情况是已经有病毒潜伏到社区里。
In fact, I think, before the U. S. "blockade," it is possible that the virus is already lurking in the community.
以纽约州为例，首例确诊是3月1日，在这之前，报道的多个疑似病例都检验出阴性。
In New York state, for example, the first case was confirmed on March 1, after negative results were reported for a number of suspected cases.
但是，美国疾控中心(CDC)曾经出过试剂盒有缺陷的乌龙事件，而每个个案都只经过一次检测，未能考虑多次检测才能“阴转阳”的可能性，加上试剂盒的数量不足，导致可能存在未受到检测的病例。
However, the CDC has made a faulty test kit, and each case has been tested only once, failing to consider the possibility of multiple tests to "yin-yang," combined with the insufficient number of test kits, which may have led to undetected cases.
到3月8日下午为止，纽约大都会区，即包括纽约和周遭的新泽西州和康涅狄格州，至少发现了113 例病例。
By the afternoon of March 8, at least 113 cases had been found in the New York metropolitan area, including New York and the surrounding states of New Jersey and Connecticut.
其中最大一部分感染源来自纽约州威彻斯特县的一个超级传染者，几乎所有确诊的82例都源自这名在曼哈顿中城上班的律师。
The largest part of the infection came from a super-infector in Westchester County, New York, and almost all of the 82 confirmed cases came from the midtown Manhattan attorney.
这是纽约州确诊的第二例，也是社区传播的第一例。
This is the second confirmed case in New York State and the first case of community transmission.
美国卫生专家表示，特朗普政府的混乱信号使美国人 对公共卫生危机没有做好准备，并延迟了他们对这种病毒的了解。
US health experts say the Trump administration's messy signals have left Americans unprepared for the public-health crisis and delayed their understanding of the virus.
截至美东时间3月9日零时，病毒已经传播到至少32 个州。
By 0000 March 9, the virus had spread to at least 32 states.
美国的医疗和基础公共卫生设施有相当的水准，但是，目前特朗普政府的公信力受到考验，如何在避免大众恐慌 和提供关键信息并做出果断回应之间，努力寻求有效的平衡，将是媒体和大众聚焦的问题。
America's health care and basic public-health facilities are of comparable standard, but the Trump administration's credibility is now being tested, and the search for an effective balance between averting mass panic and providing critical information and a decisive response will be a matter of media and public focus.
不久前，有吹哨者投书美国CDC，举报卫生和公共服务部的工作人员在加州的两个军事基地与自中国撤侨的美国人接触时，不但没有穿着适当的个人防护装备，而且还在基地外任意走动。
Not long ago, whistleblowers wrote to the United States CDC, reporting that HHS staff had not only not been wearing proper PPE but were moving around outside the base when contacting Americans evacuating from China at two military bases in California.
最近，在哈佛大学举行的新冠病毒研讨会上，哈佛公共卫生研究讲座教授巴里布·卢姆表示，美国联邦政府中有17个机构负责处理疫情，它们都各自拥有权力、经费和管理权。
At a recent Harvard University seminar on the New Crown Virus, Harvard Chair Professor of Public Health Barry Lumme said that the federal government has 17 agencies that deal with the epidemic, each with its own powers, funding, and management.
白宫曾经有一个应对大流行病的办公室，能够与所有17个政府机构的代表定期通话。
The White House once had an office for pandemic preparedness that was able to communicate regularly with representatives of all 17 government agencies.
因此理论上，联邦政府事实上有能力实施避免传染病在美国爆发的任何举措，但由于美国的医疗体系支离破碎，各州都有自己的医保和资金问题。
So, in theory, the federal government is in fact capable of doing anything to avoid an outbreak of infectious disease in the United States, but because the US health-care system is fragmented, states have their own health-care and funding problems.
“那么这17个机构是否每天都与50个州的公共卫生部门保持联系呢?这50个州又是否与每个城市和城镇的公共卫生官员保持联系呢?甲型H1N1流感暴发后，美国制定了一项重要的国家流感计划，其中包括如何组织并规划这种沟通、如何提前应对等......然而，(美国)现在的情况是，直到昨天，白宫的这一办公室都不再存在，国家安全委员会中也没有专人(处理类似事件)......当《纽约时报》记者问 :美国是否为一场真正严重的疫情做好了准备?目前来看，我不得不遗憾地说 :美国曾经做好了准备，但只是曾经。
"So are these 17 agencies in daily contact with the public health departments of the 50 states? Are the 50 states in touch with public health officials in every city and town? After the H1N1 outbreak, the United States has a major national influenza plan...
”巴里布·卢姆说。
"said Barry-Rohm.
医疗费用与带薪病假防止疫情暴发的一项挑战是美国健康保险体系的结构。
One of the challenges in preventing outbreaks of disease with medical expenses and paid sick leave is the structure of the United States health insurance system.
根据美国人口普查局的数据，2018年约有7%的美国成年人(2750 万)缺乏医疗保险，这使得看医生、紧急护理或急诊室的费用很高。
According to the US Census Bureau, about 7% of US adults (27.5 million) lacked health insurance in 2018, making access to a doctor, emergency care, or emergency room expensive.
根据美国疾控中心的报告，在没有保险的18岁至65岁年龄段的人中，有 28%的人在过去一年中没法支付医疗费用。
According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 28 percent of the uninsured 18-65 age group have been unable to pay for health care in the past year.
另一份报告显示，超过四分之一的美国成年人由于经济状况而推迟必须的医疗服务。
Another report shows that more than a quarter of American adults postpone essential medical care because of their financial situation.
而这些缺乏医疗保险的人中有很多是非法移民。
And many of those who lack health insurance are illegal immigrants.
没有身份是这些人拒绝看病的另一个重要理由。
Lack of identity is another important reason why these people refuse to see a doctor.
即使是合法公民，没有保险也是病毒检测的坎儿。
Even legitimate citizens, without insurance is a virus detection child.
以在中国武汉住过长达15年的弗兰克·乌辛斯基为例，他的中国妻子不是美国公民并患有肺炎，他带着女儿随着政府撤侨班机回到美国，但没有医疗保险的他收到他和女儿进行检疫和冠状病毒检测的账单，合计3918美元。
For example, Frank Ushinsky, who lived in Wuhan, China for 15 years, and whose Chinese wife is not an American citizen and has pneumonia, returned to the United States with his daughter on a government evacuation flight, but without medical insurance he received bills from him and his daughter for quarantine and coronavirus testing, totalling $3,918.
在经过《纽约时报》报道后，提供测试的医院发言人说账单有误，因此他不必付款。
A spokesman for the hospital that provided the test said the bill was wrong after the New York Times report, so he did not have to pay.
特朗普政府在3月初宣布，将病毒测试作为一项基本的健康福利。
The Trump administration announced early in March that testing for the virus would be a basic health benefit.
根据《可负担医疗法案》，大雇主的健康保险必须涵盖预防性检测等费用。
Under the Affordable Care Act, health insurance for large employers must cover costs such as preventive testing.
但对个人来说，这些检测不一定免费。
For individuals, however, these tests are not necessarily free of charge.
目前包括纽约和华盛顿在内的一些州已发布紧急命令，指示各州监管的医疗保险公司为需要进行新冠病毒检测的患者免除任何自付费用。
Some states, including New York and Washington, have issued emergency orders instructing state-regulated health insurers to waive any out-of-pocket fees for patients who need to be tested for the virus.
一些健康保险公司也宣布与新冠病毒有关的检测免除自费。
Some health insurance companies have also announced exemption from self-payment for new crown virus-related tests.
但是根据健康保险的类型、承保范围和保险公司的不同，患者可能要承担的费用也有所不同。
However, depending on the type of health insurance, the coverage and the insurance company, patients may have to bear different costs.
美国是没有法定带薪病假的发达国家之一。
The United States is one of the developed countries without statutory paid sick leave.
根据美国劳工部的数据，超过四分之一的私营行业工人没有这项福利，其中包括最低25%工资群体中有一半以上请病假时拿不到工资。
According to data from the United States Department of Labor, more than a quarter of workers in the private sector do not receive such benefits, including more than half of the lowest 25 per cent of wage groups who are on sick leave without pay.
更糟糕的是，许多无法获得带薪病假的人在儿童保育、饭店、旅馆和旅行业就职，他们的工作性质需要每天与许多人接触，不但自身是高风险群，也可能有助于传播病毒。
Worse still, many people who are unable to access paid sick leave work in childcare, hotels, hotels and the travel industry, and the nature of their work requires daily contact with many people, who are themselves a high-risk group and may also contribute to the spread of the virus.
根据美国劳工部的数据，在这些服务行业中，超过五分之二的工人没有带薪病假。
According to the United States Department of Labor, more than two-fifths of workers in these services have no paid sick leave.
目前私人企业如沃尔玛和山姆俱乐部制定了一项新的紧急带薪工假政策，副总统彭斯表示白宫正在与国会领导人商讨对策解决这个担忧。
Now private companies such as Wal-Mart and Sam's Club have introduced a new emergency paid leave policy, and Vice President Burns says the White House is working with congressional leaders to address the concern.
口罩迷思纽约市有亚洲以外和美国境内所有城市中最大、最集中的华人群体，2014 年估计华人占纽约市总人口 6%，并且许多华人与中国保持着密切的商业往来。
Mask Myth New York City has the largest and most concentrated Chinese population outside Asia and in all cities in the United States. In 2014, the Chinese population was estimated to comprise 6 per cent of the total population of New York City, and many Chinese maintain close business ties with China.
目前，由于第二波疫情已经在亚洲、中东和欧洲大量蔓延，作为世界之都的纽约已经很难追踪病毒的来源。
Now that a second wave has spread across Asia, the Middle East, and Europe, it is difficult for New York, the world's capital, to trace the source of the virus.
3月7日，纽约州州长安德鲁·库莫宣布该州进入紧急状态。
On 7 March, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency in the state.
他表示，保持冷静并 不是优先考虑的事情，而是要扩大测试。
Keeping calm is not a priority, he says, but expanding testing.
我十分同意。
I quite agree with you.
像纽约市这样的大都会有常住人口862.3万，其中曼哈顿岛的人口约为163万人。
Metropolises like New York City have a resident population of 8.623 million, of which Manhattan has a population of about 1.63 million.
挤在大约60平方公里的土地上，平均人口密度为每平方公里27346人。
Crowded on approximately 60 square kilometres, the average population density is 27,346 persons per square kilometre.
在这个小岛上，聚集了世界无数的“高飞族”和来自全球各地的民族群体，可以把全世界的病毒在24小时内运到本土，加上各种不同卫生习惯的龙蛇杂处，也有非法移民不敢去看医生。
The island is home to countless "flying" people from around the world and ethnic groups from all over the world, who can transport viruses from around the world to their home countries within 24 hours.
你说，一旦疫情暴发，我戴不戴口罩?美国卫生和公共服务部3月4日表示，如果美国的新冠病毒暴发达到大流行程度，医护人员将需要35亿个口罩。
Do I wear face masks in the event of an outbreak? The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said Monday that if the outbreak reaches pandemic proportions, health-care workers will need 3.5 billion face masks.
然而，据美国电视网CNBC的报道，目前美国应急储备包括 大约1200万个N95口罩和3000万个外科口罩，大约是所需数量的 1%。
However, the U.S. emergency stockpile now includes about 12 million N95 masks and 30 million surgical masks, about 1 percent of what is needed, according to the U.S. television network CNBC.
美国众议院和参议院在3月4日达成了一项决议，拨出83亿美元紧急资金来应对美国日益严重的疫情，其中部分新 批准的资金将在未来18个月内用来购买约5亿个N95口罩。
The U.S. House of Representatives and Senate agreed on March 4 to allocate $8.3 billion in emergency funding to address the growing U.S. epidemic, part of which will be used to buy about 500 million N95 million masks over the next 18 months.
戴不戴口罩我认为主要并不是社会彼此信任度的问题，而是因为有文化差异。
Wearing a mask is not primarily a matter of social trust, I think, but of cultural differences.
我相信，疫情如果在纽约暴发，华人以外的纽约人也会开始戴口罩。
I believe that if the outbreak occurs in New York, New Yorkers other than Chinese will start wearing masks.
美国人不戴口罩的一个原因是，美国大部分地区看起来都像在郊区——独立别墅组成的住宅区通过道路连接到零售中心和办公楼。
One reason Americans don't wear masks is that much of the United States looks like a residential suburb with separate villas connected by road to retail centers and office buildings.
根据2018年美国政府发布的《2017年美国住房调查》，全国近76000个家庭中，约有52%认为自己住在郊区，而约27%自认为住在城市，有21%自称住在农村。
According to the 2017 United States Housing Survey, published by the United States Government in 2018, approximately 52 per cent of the nearly 76,000 households in the country consider themselves to live in the suburbs, while about 27 per cent consider themselves to be in the cities and 21 per cent in the countryside.
因此，大多数美国人觉得自己住在人口不是很密集的郊区，自然不需要戴口罩。
As a result, most Americans feel they live in less densely populated suburbs and naturally do not need to wear masks.
另外一个更重要的因素是，中国内地、香港、台湾以及其他亚洲国家和地区对于口罩的观念从SARS 疫情之后，产生了颠覆性的改变，口罩已经不再带有负面的社会标签。
Another, more important factor is that perceptions of masks in mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and other Asian countries and regions have changed dramatically since the SARS epidemic, with masks no longer carrying negative social labels.
而欧美国家没有亲身受到大面积感染SARS病毒的威胁，也就没有形成“口罩文化”。
And the United States and Europe are not personally affected by a large area of the SARS virus threat, also did not form a "mask culture."
但多年来，不论什么季节，我出门必定在包里放一两个口罩和几包酒精消毒片，防的就是猝不及防地在公共场合撞见大咳特咳、又不掩口的缺德鬼。
But for years, no matter what season I go out, I must put a mask or two in my bag and a few packets of disinfectant to ward off the evil spirits who catch a cough and cough in public and don't hide it.
我相信，由于疫情与其牵动的供应链趋势直接关系到股市，而在特朗普看来，股市将直接影响他连任的选情，因此，不久他应该会下重手来防止疫情恶化。
I believe that, because the epidemic has a direct bearing on the supply-chain trends it is driving, and because, in Trump's view, the stock market will have a direct impact on his re-election campaign, he should soon make a major effort to prevent the epidemic from worsening.
但是，在特朗普的疫情处理变得更靠谱之前，我还是戴上我的口罩吧。
But before Trump's case gets any more reliable, I'd better put on my mask.
