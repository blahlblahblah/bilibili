澎湃新闻记者 汤琪武汉市文化和旅游局1月27日凌晨发布的一封信，公布了目前仍在境外的武汉游客数量：4096名。
A letter from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism issued in the early morning of January 27 revealed the number of Wuhan tourists who are still overseas: 4,096.
已经滞留在新加坡4天的武汉人李姝然就是其中之一。
Li Nan, a Wuhan national who had stayed in Singapore for four days, was one of them.
1月19日，当她落地新加坡时，武汉市卫健委官网公布的新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎病例还只有62例。
When she landed in Singapore on January 19, only 62 cases of the new coronavirus-infected pneumonia were reported on Wuhan's website.
8天后，1月27日，官方通报的全国确诊病例已达2744例，其中武汉698例。
Eight days later, on January 27, the number of confirmed cases nationwide officially reached 2,744, including 698 in Wuhan.
这场发端于去年12月的疫情，以武汉为中心，早已扩散至除西藏之外的全国各地。
The outbreak, which began last December and is centered in Wuhan, has spread to all parts of the country except Tibet.
23日，大年二十九，武汉导游穆欧一晚都没有睡着。
23, about 29, Wuhan tour guide did not sleep one night.
这天凌晨2时许，他在手机上刷到武汉23日10时起“封城”的消息后，开始隐隐担心。
At about 2 a.m. on the mobile phone, he painted the 23 Wuhan since 10 a.m. "closed the city" news, began to worry.
“我当时还只是想，如果所有公共交通停运，我该如何从武汉天河机场回家。
"I was just wondering how I would get home from Wuhan Tianhe Airport if all public transportation was out of commission.
”穆欧对澎湃新闻表示，23日清晨6时许，他接到了航班取消的消息，当天中午，他决定改签最近的航班飞往杭州，并在手机上订了一家当地的酒店。
Mr Muo told the roaring news that he had received the cancellation around 6 a.m. on the 23rd and decided at noon to change the nearest flight to Hangzhou and book a local hotel on his cell phone.
可他当时还未曾可知，他所预订的那家酒店早已张贴出公告——自1月19日起会对武汉籍和武汉疫区归杭的旅客暂停办理入住手续。
But he did not know that the hotel he had booked had posted a notice to suspend check-in from January 19 for visitors from Wuhan and Wuhan affected areas.
由于人们对疫情扩散传播的担忧，部分武汉出境游旅游团队在返程时改签航班、从兄弟城市入境后住宿和返汉交通等方面遇到了困难，一些武汉返乡人员信息甚至遭受泄露，网上对武汉人的“歧视”言论频现。
Concerns about the spread of the epidemic have led some Wuhan outbound travel teams to change flights on their return journeys, lodging from fraternal cities and returning to the Han Dynasty. Some information about Wuhan returnees has even been leaked, and "discriminatory" remarks about Wuhan people are frequent.
疫情漩涡中的武汉人出不去，漩涡之外的4096名武汉滞留旅客，归途变得困难重重。
Wuhan people in the vortex of the epidemic can not get out, outside the vortex of 4,096 stranded Wuhan passengers, return to become difficult.
出境顺利，入境难1月19日凌晨，武汉市卫健委官网还在公布两天前的数据。
Departure smooth, difficult to enter the early hours of January 19, Wuhan City Wei health officials network is still published two days ago data.
通报显示，截至1月17日24时，武汉市累计报告新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎病例62例。
As of 2400 hours on January 17, 62 cases of pneumonia with a new coronavirus infection have been reported in Wuhan.
这时，李姝然已经抵达武汉天河机场准备登机，她早前就和同事一起在旅行社订好去新加坡的机票和酒店，此时的天河机场已经开始对旅客进行体温检测。
NINETY NINETY had arrived at Wuhan Tianhe Airport to board the plane. Earlier, she and her colleagues had booked tickets and a hotel for Singapore at Tian He Airport.
同一班机飞新加坡的导游穆欧18日晚就到机场清点他所带团的人数，准备值机。
The same flight to Singapore tour guide Muo 18 night to the airport to count the number of his regiment, ready to go on duty.
他注意到，进机场的时候，如果被检测出体温高于37.3度，就会被强制隔离。
He noted that when entering the airport, if the body temperature was found to be above 37.3 degrees, it would be forcibly isolated.
穆欧带领的团队所有人体温正常，而有的团队出现体温过高的人，当场就被扣了下来，禁止出境。
All members of the team led by Mr. Muo had normal body temperatures, while others appeared to have hyperthermia and were detained on the spot and banned from leaving the country.
19日清晨5时许，飞机落地新加坡，穆欧接到旅行社通知，天河机场后续出境航班基本上全部被取消。
On the 19th, around 5 a.m., the plane landed in Singapore, Muo was informed by the travel agency, Tianhe Airport follow-up flights were almost all cancelled.
作为游客的李姝然对此并不知情，但她也逐渐从微博等社交媒体上感知到武汉疫情的强烈波动。
NINETY NINETY, a tourist, knew nothing about this, but she also gradually sensed the violent fluctuations of the epidemic on social media such as Weibo.
更让她有些担忧的是，在距离武汉4000多公里外的新加坡，电视上都在长时间播出有关这场疫情的新闻。
What worried her the most was that more than 4,000 kilometers away from Wuhan, Singapore, where news of the outbreak was broadcast over a long period of time.
21日，新加坡官方报告当地已出现7例疑似新冠肺炎。
Singapore reported 7 cases of suspected new crown pneumonia on Thursday.
这天，李姝然在朋友圈发了9张游玩照片。
On that day, Li Ni Ran distributed nine travel photos among friends.
“拍照行程到此结束。
"This concludes our photo shoot.
”她在朋友圈如此写道。
'she wrote in her circle of friends.
但转过头，她在好友群里坦言，“我都没有心情玩了。
But turning to her friends, she confessed, "I'm not in the mood to play.
”因为，截至20日24时，武汉市累计报告的新冠肺炎病例已达258例，这已经是她19日出境时可知的62例的四倍多。
As of 2400 on the 20th, Wuhan had reported 258 new cases of pneumonia, more than four times the 62 cases she knew at the time of her departure on the 19th.
新加坡首例确诊病例出现在23日，大年二十九。
Singapore's first confirmed case occurred on the 23rd, about 29 years old.
这天原本是李姝然回家的日子。
The day was originally a day for Li Ni Ran returning home.
第二天就是除夕，计划中她本来是要和家人一起吃年夜饭的。
The next day was New Year's Eve, when it was planned that she would have dinner with her family.
穆欧则一晚上都没有睡着。
Muo did not sleep all night.
23日凌晨2时许，他还在玩手机，突如其来的消息打破了他的睡意——武汉市新冠肺炎疫情防控指挥部通告称，自23日10时起，全市城市公交、地铁、轮渡、长途客运暂停运营；无特殊原因，市民不要离开武汉，机场、火车站离汉通道暂时关闭，恢复时间另行通告。
Since 1000 hours on the 23rd the city's city buses, subways, ferries and long-distance passenger transport have been suspended from operation. People are not allowed to leave Wuhan and the airport and railway stations are temporarily closed.
躺在床上，他隐隐担忧的是，第二天白天他飞回武汉的航班落地后，公共交通已经停运，他该如何从天河机场回到30多公里外的家。
Lying on his bed, he was vaguely worried about how he would return to his home more than 30 kilometers from Tianhe Airport after public transport had been suspended when his flight back to Wuhan landed the next day.
他用手机地图导航算了算，如果从机场走回去，需要近8个小时。
He used mobile map navigation to calculate that it would take nearly eight hours to walk back from the airport.
“有没有人一起走？”穆欧当时还截图发了条朋友圈。
"Does anyone go with you?" Muo also attempted to send a circle of friends.
难以预料的是，阻挡他回家的岂止是这需要步行的8小时。
Unexpectedly, it was not just the eight hours of walking that held him back.
4天后，他被隔离在了杭州的一家医院里。
Four days later, he was quarantined in a hospital in Hangzhou.
新加坡一居民区附近药店大量购进口罩。
Pharmacies near a residential area in Singapore are buying large quantities of masks.
本文图片均为受访者提供两种选择：滞留或无家可归1月23日，新加坡阳光明媚，武汉阴雨连绵。
2007-9-25 21: 23 The sun shines brightly in Singapore and the rain pours down on Wuhan on January 23.
这天一大早，当李姝然和穆欧在新加坡机场得知当天飞往武汉的酷航航班被取消后，做出了两种截然不同的选择。
Early that morning, after learning at Singapore airport that the cool flight to Wuhan had been canceled, Li Niland and Mou made two very different choices.
武汉“封城”令下，全国各地都感到警觉。
Wuhan "closure" order, all over the country are alarmed.
随着新冠肺炎确诊病例日益剧增，武汉人在网络环境中遭遇到了不同程度的“歧视”。
With the increasing number of confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia, Wuhan people in the network environment encountered varying degrees of "discrimination."
现实中，湖北人、武汉人在外地无法入住酒店，一些武汉返乡人员信息泄露的现象频现，让李姝然对转飞国内其他城市后再回汉的方式不太有信心。
In reality, Hubei people, Wuhan people in the field can not stay in the hotel, some information leaks to Wuhan returnees frequent phenomenon, Li Yan to fly to other cities in the country after Han less confident.
她决定，暂时先不改签，等待酷航再安排出后续直飞武汉的航班。
She decided not to change her name for the time being and wait for the cool air to arrange a direct flight to Wuhan.
于是，她又花费一万多元人民币订了一家新加坡的酒店。
So she booked a hotel in Singapore for more than 10,000 yuan.
穆欧23日带团到了新加坡机场，他了解到，他们当天可免费改签飞往香港、广州、杭州、南京、长沙等城市的航班。
"When he arrived at the Singapore airport on the 23rd, he learned that they could change flights to Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Nanjing and Changsha free of charge on the same day.
在征求团队旅客意见时，旅客均表示希望尽快回国，他们就直接改签了离被取消航班起飞时间最近的一趟，飞往杭州。
During the consultation with the group, the passengers expressed their wish to return home as soon as possible. They immediately changed their name to Hangzhou, the nearest departure time of the cancelled flight.
有一部分武汉籍旅客从新加坡转飞泰国。
Some of the Wuhan passengers were diverted from Singapore to Thailand.
做出决定后，穆欧在网上成功预定了一家杭州的酒店，打算23日晚先在杭州住一晚，第二天再想办法回汉。
After the decision, Mou successfully booked a hotel in Hangzhou on the internet. He intends to stay in Hangzhou for one night on the 23rd night and try to return to Han the next day.
和他同机抵达杭州的一些旅客多来自湖北其他地市，一些人买了24日早晨的航班从杭州飞回宜昌，打算到了宜昌后再想办法回到各自老家。
Some of the passengers who arrived in Hangzhou with him came from other cities in Hubei Province. Some of them bought a flight back to Yichang from Hangzhou on the morning of the 24th.
事实上，从杭州机场出关，每个人都会经过体温的检疫，穆欧安然离开机场。
In fact, from Hangzhou airport exit, everyone will go through the body temperature quarantine, Muo Enron left the airport.
但当他到达预定酒店时才发现，这家酒店早已张贴出告示称，为响应国家抗击新冠肺炎号召，自1月19日起对武汉籍和武汉疫区归杭旅客暂停办理入住手续。
However, when he arrived at the hotel, he found that the hotel had already posted a notice saying that, in response to the national call to fight the new crown pneumonia, the check-in procedures for Guihang passengers from Wuhan and epidemic areas had been suspended since January 19.
当酒店得知他是武汉人之后，立刻报警了。
When the hotel learned that he was Wuhan, immediately called the police.
两种除夕：酒店的春晚和半夜的网吧检疫人员和警察几乎是同时来的。
Two New Year's Eve: the hotel's Spring Festival Gala and midnight Internet cafes quarantine personnel and police almost at the same time.
他们先用耳温枪给穆欧测量体温，后又用体温计再次确认他并无发热症状，但还是要求他隔离。
They took Muo's temperature with a lukewarm gun, then reassured him with a thermometer that he had no fever, but demanded isolation.
检疫人员、警察、酒店工作人员开始商量他的去处，期间，穆欧又给多个酒店打电话询问是否可入住，当得知他是武汉人后，均回绝了。
Quarantine staff, police, hotel staff began to discuss his whereabouts, during which time Muo called a number of hotels to inquire if he could be admitted, when learned that he is Wuhan, refused.
商量之后，并无办法。
After discussion, there was nothing else to do.
警察只要求他去隔离，却也没有为他指明去处，酒店又执意不许他住，他只好在深更半夜的杭州游荡。
The police only asked him to be quarantined, but they gave him no indication of his whereabouts, and the hotel refused to allow him to stay.
好不容易找到一家网吧，网管又对他武汉人的身份并不太在意，才终于落了脚，打开电脑“吃鸡”熬时间。
Hard to find an Internet cafes, the network management of his Wuhan identity is not very concerned, just finally fell off the feet, open the computer "eat chicken" boil time.
此时已经是1月24日凌晨3时许，除夕，穆欧距离回武汉还有700多公里。
It was around 3 a.m. on January 24, and on New Year's Eve, he was still more than 700 kilometers away from Wuhan.
新加坡和中国没有时差，此时的李姝然也辗转反侧，难以入眠。
Singapore and China did not have jet lag, Li Ran also tossing and turning, hard to sleep.
到了24日晚，当地唐人街的年味渐浓，有演出的舞台上欢歌笑语，李姝然站在远处拍了个小视频留作纪念，便回了酒店。
On the evening of the 24th, the local Chinatown was getting thicker, with songs and laughter on the stage, and Li Ni Ran stood in the distance to take a video as a souvenir, and returned to the hotel.
在新加坡的酒店里看春晚。
Watch the Spring Festival Gala at a hotel in Singapore.
“终于找到了家里的频道，倍感亲切温暖。
"At last I found the channel at home and felt very warm.
”除夕夜，她发了条朋友圈，配上了央视春晚为此次疫情临时添加的朗诵节目。
On New Year's Eve, she sent out a circle of friends, paired with CCTV's impromptu reading program for the epidemic.
她写道，“第一次在外过年，第一次这么深切地体会到团圆的美好。
"For the first time, I felt the happiness of reunion so deeply," she wrote.
除了想家，一切都好，祝大家平安喜乐，鼠年安康。
All is well except homesick. Wish you all peace and joy and a happy Year of the Rat.
”第二天，大年初一，李姝然和同事要换到另一家酒店。
The next day, Nina Li and her colleagues moved to another hotel.
入住前，酒店为她们测量了体温，无发热症状。
Before they checked in, the hotel took their temperature, without any fever.
填写了相关信息后，她们顺利入住。
After filling out the relevant information, they move in smoothly.
在国内，穆欧的杭州之行却愈发曲折。
At home, Mr Muo's trip to Hangzhou has become increasingly tortuous.
他好不容易在24日订上了一家对武汉人身份无异议的民宿，两天后，一觉醒来感觉有些头痛、咳嗽。
On the 24th, he made a reservation on the identity of Wuhan residents, two days later, I woke up feeling a bit headache, cough.
出于对自己和他人负责，这一次，穆欧自己报了警。
Out of a sense of responsibility for himself and others, this time, he called the police himself.
当晚，他便被送进了杭州的一家医院进行隔离检查。
That night, he was taken to a Hangzhou hospital for a seclusion.
回不去的人，不愿被忘记回不去家的武汉人，远不止他们。
Can not go back to the people, do not want to be forgotten home Wuhan people, far more than they.
1月27日凌晨，武汉市文化和旅游局（以下简称“文旅局”）微信号紧急发布《致兄弟城市旅游行业同仁的一封信》，信中提到，从1月23日10时起，武汉口岸旅行团队出境数量为零，但尚有4096名武汉游客仍在境外。
In the early morning hours of January 27, Wuhan Municipal Culture and Tourism Bureau (hereinafter referred to as "Cultural and Tourism Bureau") issued an urgent "Letter to colleagues in the tourism industry of fraternal cities," the letter mentioned that from 10: 00 January 23, Wuhan port travel team number zero, but there are 4,096 Wuhan tourists still outside.
