深度和角度——这就是我们能做的。

老母亲问我为啥这么拼命，又没人给开工资。
The old mother asked me why I was working so hard and nobody paid me.
我回说，这次真的拼了命了，只因为我是您的孩子，也是一个父亲。
I replied that this time it was really a struggle because I was your child and a father.
这不，我看到日本朋友捐助武汉的物资上，日本汉语水平考试事务所物资上的字——“山川异域，风月同天”。
This is not, I saw the Japanese friends donated Wuhan materials, Japanese Chinese proficiency exam office material on the word - "strange mountains and rivers, the same day."
作为武汉人，难道我不该更为家乡做些什么吗？口述、图 | 白慧冬整理 | 姜浩峰过年前，因为工作上的事，我从武汉开车，先到重庆，再到四川省阿坝藏族羌族自治州，在返回武汉的半路，车遇到了问题，只得飞回武汉。
As a Wuhan native, shouldn't I have done more at home? Before the Chinese New Year, I drove from Wuhan to Chongqing and then to the Qiang Autonomous Prefecture of Aba Tibetan in Sichuan Province. Halfway back to Wuhan, I had problems and had to fly back to Wuhan.
然后，武汉封城了。
Then, Wuhan closed the city.
在春节期间，我先后接到了阿坝州和重庆公安的电话。
During the Spring Festival, I received telephone calls from Aba Prefecture and Chongqing Public Security.
我向他们如实说明了自己去过的地方，以及自己身体的情况。
I told them exactly where I had been and what had happened to my body.
目前来看，从阿坝州回武汉已有半个月了，我的身体很健康。
At present, from Aba Prefecture back to Wuhan has been half a month, my health is very healthy.
相信没有携带新型冠状病毒，也就没有将病毒传染给任何人。
It is believed that without the new coronavirus, there would have been no transmission to anyone.
接下来的一段日子，作为青宁信安科技的联合创始人，我肯定不能出武汉，去深圳的总部工作，或者再出差。
In the next few days, as a co-founder of Xinan Technology in Qingning, I will certainly not be able to leave Wuhan to work in Shenzhen headquarters, or travel again.
但我相信疫情一定能控制住，一切都会好起来。
But I'm sure the outbreak will be under control and everything will be okay.
在武汉，我宅在家里，除了为支援武汉的志愿者们提供力所能及的帮助，每天还写“坚守日记”。
In Wuhan, I stay at home, in addition to supporting Wuhan volunteers to provide assistance within their capacity, but also write "adhere to the diary" every day.
我现在武汉的日常我做的有角动物放牧机器人项目，本身与牧区防疫有关。
I am now Wuhan daily I do horned animal grazing robot project, and its own epidemic prevention related to pastoral areas.
应阿坝州红原县畜牧局的邀请，我1月15日从武汉动身。
At the invitation of the Livestock Bureau of Hongyuan County, Aba Prefecture, I started from Wuhan on January 15.
之所以开车去重庆，是因为此前我们在西藏当雄县安装的放牧机器人，多出来20套，正好用在阿坝。
The reason we drove to Chongqing was because we had installed 20 more grazing robots in Dangxiong County, Tibet, just for Aba.
在红原县牧区我开车到重庆，是1月16日。
I drove to Chongqing in the pastoral area of Hongyuan County on January 16.
中午还和重庆的朋友一起吃了火锅，并顺便谈了下项目合作的事。
At noon, I also had a hot pot with my friends in Chongqing and talked about the cooperation of the project.
当时，武汉新型冠状病毒引起的肺炎的情况，我们武汉老百姓如果没得这个肺炎，也是无感的。
At that time, Wuhan caused by the new coronavirus pneumonia, we common people in Wuhan, if not this pneumonia, is also senseless.
不知道疫情发展会这么严重。
I didn't know how serious the outbreak would be.
更别提重庆的朋友了。
Not to mention Chongqing's friends.
吃完火锅，我就开车去了机场，接了设备就奔赴红原县。
After eating hotpot, I drove to the airport, picked up the equipment and rushed to Hongyuan County.
在安装完动物放牧机器人以后，我开车回武汉，哪知道在一个叫三家寨的地方撞车了。
After installing the animal grazing robot, I drove back to Wuhan, but I didn't know that I had crashed in a place called Zhai.
4S店告诉我，春节前修不好。
4S shop told me that repair before Spring Festival is not good.
我只得去成都，飞回武汉。
I had to go to Chengdu and fly back to Wuhan.
到成都时，已经是1月22日凌晨了。
By the time we got to Chengdu, it was early morning on January 22nd.
我的车困在了三家寨那时候，我听说很多人都在出逃，逃离武汉。
While my car was stuck in three shanzhai, I heard a lot of people were fleeing Wuhan.
我却一定要回家。
But I have to go home.
我对朋友说，我不能走，我儿子还在武汉，我70岁的老母亲还在武汉，我不能带他们在封城前到火车站经历更大的风险。
I said to my friends, I can't go, my son is still in Wuhan, my 70-year-old mother is still in Wuhan, I can't take them to the railway station in front of the city to experience greater risks.
医学常识告诉我，这不科学！我当时想，只有返家，只要我在家，他们才能好好活下去。
Medical common sense told me it was unscientific! I thought they would have to go home and live as long as I am at home.
1月22日的武汉机场，出入口都加了红外测温设备回到武汉以后，我发现情况和出武汉时迥异了。
On January 22, Wuhan airport, the entrance and exit have added infrared temperature measurement equipment back to Wuhan, I found that the situation and out of Wuhan is very different.
譬如机场出入口都加了红外测温设备。
Infrared temperature measuring equipment has been installed at the entrance and exit of the airport.
在出口处，我看到一位没有戴口罩的出租车师傅，心里第一感觉就是绕开他走。
At the exit, I saw a taxi driver without a mask. My first feeling was to bypass him.
我从成排的其他人后面绕过去。
I went round behind the rest of the line.
他还追问我要不要车。
He also asked me if I wanted a car.
我心里都在骂娘了：“要车也不敢要你这样的车！”他一看我推着行李开始狂奔，就自己意识到了，然后就不再追我了。
I was swearing in my heart: "If I wanted a car like you!" He saw me rush with my luggage, he realized, and then stopped chasing me.
上地铁后，发现平时下班时间段人满为患的地铁，基本上是空的。
After getting on the subway, I found that the subway, which is usually crowded with people during the normal working hours, is basically empty.
火车站那一站上来的人也特别少。
There were very few people at the station.
1月22日下午本是下班高峰时的武汉地铁真的封城了。
January 22 afternoon is the peak of the work of Wuhan subway really closed the city.
对于我来说，封城并不是特别严重的问题——我的公司在深圳，但我平时也不常去，大多数时间我在武汉。
For me, the closure of the city is not a particularly serious problem - my company is in Shenzhen, but I don't usually go there, I spend most of the time in Wuhan.
原本准备春节后去北京，会一会中国农业大学的刘继军教授。
Originally prepared to go to Beijing after the Spring Festival, a meeting of China Agricultural University Professor Liu Jijun.
他是畜牧工程方面的专家，我想听听他对我们产品的意见，以及在畜牧业动物当代保护领域的发展前景。
He is an expert in animal husbandry, and I'd like to hear his opinions on our products and the prospects for the future in the field of animal husbandry and contemporary conservation.
另一方面，也会一会我清华的师兄。
On the other hand, there will be my brother Tsinghua.
但目前来看，这些事暂时只能搁置。
But for now, these things have to be put on hold.
回到家后，我也盯着我1月22日所乘航班的信息，最终确认，那个航班没有感染者。
When I got home, I, too, stared at the information about my January 22 flight and finally confirmed that there was no one on it.
幸甚！我乘坐的航班没有感染者1月27日，农历大年初三20时55分，我接到了来自阿坝州马尔康市的电话。
Fortunately, my flight did not infect January 27, Lunar New Year, at 2055 hours, I received a call from the city of Malkang Aba.
对方自称是公安局的，通过移动公司了解到我这个手机号码此前到过阿坝州。
The other side claimed to be the police, through the mobile company to know that my mobile phone number has been to Aba State.
想了解一下我的情况。
Want to know something about me.
我当时心想，公安同志确实是够敬业的，大晚上的还在打电话，逐一排查。
I thought that the public security comrades are really dedicated enough, the big night is still on the phone, one by one check.
我回答了他们的问话，包括我的名字、身体状况、去过哪些地方等等。
I answered their questions, including my name, my health, where I had been, and so on.
我还和对方说，自己从阿坝回到武汉已经十天了，从我自己了解到的此次新型冠状病毒疫情来看，我本人应该没有问题。
I also told each other that it has been 10 days since I returned to Wuhan from Aba. From what I know of this new coronavirus, I should have no problem myself.
同时我确定如果有症状，可以第一时间和他们联系。
At the same time I am sure that if I have symptoms, I can contact them first.
两天后，也就是1月29日大年初五，早上9点多钟，我又接到了重庆公安的电话。
Two days later, on January 29th, at about 5 a.m., I received a telephone call from Chongqing Public Security Bureau.
他们的问话和阿坝州公安差不多。
Their questions were similar to those of Aba Prefecture.
我告诉重庆公安，我到达重庆至当时，已经十多天了，没有症状。
I told Chongqing public security, I arrived in Chongqing by then, has been more than 10 days, no symptoms.
我家的循环运动舱在武汉过年，自我隔离，苦中作乐。
My family's circulation sports module in Wuhan New Year, self-isolation, bitter fun.
因为我平时经常出差，许多时候靠妈妈帮我带孩子，所以我本身就储备了许多冷冻菜，在阿坝我还带回了84斤牦牛肉。
Because I travel a lot and rely on my mother to help me with my kids, I have a lot of frozen vegetables in stock and I bring home 84 kilos of yak at Aba.
所以春节期间我们宅在家里，自我隔离，是做得到的。
So during the Spring Festival we stay at home, self-isolation, is possible.
另一方面，我家在江夏区，离武汉老城市中心比较远，超市少，且缺货，也不必去凑热闹。
On the other hand, my home in Jiangxia District, away from Wuhan old city center is relatively far, supermarket, and lack of stock, also do not have to go to roaring.
年初五，武汉放晴。
Wuhan clear early Friday.
我印象中，武汉持续了一个多月阴雨天，一下放晴，封城状态中的老百姓，心情也舒畅些。
In my impression, Wuhan lasted more than a month cloudy and rainy, a clear, closed the state of the common people, the mood is also more comfortable.
有人熬不住，出去“放风”，果然媒体报道称，市区有一家三口出门散步回家后就中招的。
Some people can not bear to go out, "wind," as reported in the media, a family of three in the downtown walk home on the move.
这么说，我家自我隔离还是对的。
So, my house was right to isolate itself.
在武东高速等待物资不过我也不是没出过门。
Waiting for supplies at Wudong Expressway But I'm not out of my house.
我在武汉家里自我隔离，也不能无所事事。
I can't do nothing but isolate myself at my home in Wuhan.
其实即使春节期间，我也挺忙的。
In fact, even during the Spring Festival, I am quite busy.
我在帮一些朋友做物资统计。
I'm helping some of my friends with the material statistics.
他们运到武汉来的援助物资，我会清点。
I will count the aid they send to Wuhan.
我家房子比较大，楼下有四个仓库，可以用来放物资。
My house is big, there are four storehouses downstairs, can be used to store goods.
物资存放在这里，有用可以来取。
The goods are stored here and are available for collection.
1月28日大年初四，有公司支援送来手套。
January 28th, the beginning of the year, some company support to send gloves.
我得去接车。
I have to pick up the bus.
因为我的车放在成都维修，所以只能开着电瓶车去接车。
Since my car was in Chengdu for repairs, I had to drive the electric car to pick it up.
凌晨三点整接到电话，匆匆出了门。
I got a call at 3 a.m. sharp and hurried out the door.
出门开了一段路，我才想起来——自己忘了戴口罩。
It took me some distance to get out of the house before I remembered that I had forgotten to wear a mask.
当时想，还真不能返回家里重新戴口罩，因为电瓶车标准里程只有40公里，如果回家取口罩，从我家到接车点，是15公里。
At the time, I thought, I really couldn't go home and wear my face mask again, because the standard mileage was only 40 kilometers, and 15 kilometers from my house to the pick-up point if you went home to get a mask.
低温会造成电瓶车电池容量下降。
Low temperatures cause battery capacity to decline.
如果耽误了时间，我很可能骑车出去，就只能推车回家！在等待接收物资的时候，看到武汉一些医院在此等候的车辆但又回头一想，自己应该是安全的——当时是凌晨，室外一个人都没有。
If I had been delayed, I would have gone out on a bike and had to take a cart home! While waiting to receive supplies, I saw some Wuhan hospitals waiting for vehicles here, but on second thoughts I thought I should be safe - it was early in the morning when there was nobody outside.
从我个人了解的病毒学的一些常识来看，这种情况下，如果空气中真有一两个新型冠状病毒，应该不至于攻破我的人体防线——它没到一定的基数、数量级，我的人体防御系统完全能抵挡得住。
From what I personally know about virology, in this case, if there were one or two new coronavirus in the air, it would not have broken my body's defenses - it would not have reached a certain base and order of magnitude, and my defenses would have withstood them.
更何况马路上一个人都没有，新型冠状病毒不可能在这种情况下在外界长时间存活。
What's more, there was no one on the road, and the new coronavirus could not have survived in such a situation for a long time.
到了接车点——武东高速出口，是凌晨3点38分。
At the pick-up point - Wuhan high-speed exit, is 3: 38 a.m.
那一车有10万多手套。
The car contained more than 100,000 gloves.
我帮助领2000副手套，用于前来武汉支援的一部分工作人员之用。
I helped to collect 2000 pairs of gloves for a part of the staff who came to Wuhan to support them.
感谢这些热心人对武汉的支持！我在武汉接到的援助物资到家时，已经是早上6点了。
Thank you for your support to Wuhan! It was 6 o'clock in the morning when the aid I received from Wuhan arrived.
幸好，我的电瓶车电池扛住了。
Luckily, my battery was holding up.
到家后，我立刻用84消毒液喷了全身，然后进入家里的循环运动舱进行了20分钟47度的蒸疗，快7点才睡下。
When I got home, I immediately sprayed myself with disinfectant 84, then went into the family's circulation module for 20 minutes and 47 degrees of steam.
老母亲问我为啥这么拼命，又没人给开工资。
The old mother asked me why I was working so hard and nobody paid me.
我回说，这次真的拼了命了，只因为我是您的孩子，也是一个父亲。
I replied that this time it was really a struggle because I was your child and a father.
这不，我看到日本朋友捐助武汉的物资上，日本汉语水平考试事务所物资上的字——“山川异域，风月同天”。
