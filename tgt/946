”“对不起，你在上海没有居住地或落脚点，按照上海的相关规定，我们将对您进行劝返，请您打开双闪灯，开车进入复检区，民警会引导您上高速返回原地。
"Sorry, you don't have a place to live or stay in Shanghai. According to the relevant regulations of Shanghai, we will persuade you to turn on the double-flashing lights and drive into the re-entry area.
”2月11日上午11点，上海青浦公安分局交警支队高速大队教导员杨海杰守在G50沪渝高速汾湖收费站内，对一个无资格入沪的驾驶员如此说道。
"Yang Haijie, a high-speed brigade instructor at Shanghai-Qingpu Public Security Bureau, stationed at the G50 Shanghai-Chongqing high-speed Fenhu toll station, told a driver who was not eligible to enter Shanghai on February 11.
G50沪渝高速是大部分安徽、江西等地长途车辆入沪的首选，在这条高速路上的汾湖收费站位于沪苏交界处，是上海的一大门户。
The G50 Shanghai-Chongqing Expressway is the first choice for most long-distance vehicles from Anhui, Jiangxi and other places.
据隧道股份数据，往年该站日均流量22820辆次，今年日均流量约18805辆次。
According to tunnel data, the average daily flow of the station in previous years 22,820 times, this year's average daily traffic about 18,805.
1月24日下午，为应对新冠肺炎疫情，上海启动重大突发公共卫生事件一级响应机制，此后逐步加紧入沪通道查控。
In the afternoon of January 24, in response to the outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia, Shanghai launched a first-level response mechanism to major public health emergencies.
1月27日14时起，上海把原高速公路114处收费站查控力量全部前移至9处高速公路省界道口公安检查站，实施“逢车必检”，确保没有一个体温超过37.3℃的外来者能开车进入上海。
Since 1400 hours on January 27, Shanghai has moved all 114 toll gates of the old expressway forward to nine border crossing public security check-points to ensure that no outsider with a body temperature exceeding 37.3 can drive into Shanghai.
杨海杰在高速口指挥。
Yang Haijie is in command at high speed.
当天，杨海杰被任命为G50沪渝高速公路省界入沪卡点负责人。
On the same day, Yang Haijie was appointed as the G50 Shanghai-Chongqing expressway into Shanghai and Shanghai point of responsibility.
“从27日接到任务开始，我就做好了24小时驻守的准备，也将女儿和儿子分别送到了岳父母和父母家中，请老人帮忙照看。
"From the moment I received my assignment on the 27th, I was ready to stay 24 hours and also took my daughter and son to my parents-in-law's home and asked the old man to take care of them.
”杨海杰说道。
"said Yang Haijie.
从27日至今，杨海杰在汾湖站已驻守了17天。
Since the 27th, Yang Haijie has been stationed at Fenhu Station for 17 days.
最初，受限于人手不足，G50汾湖站只开放两条车道，但随着返程高峰的来临，站内共9条车道也会根据实际情况进行是否开放的调整。
Initially, limited by staffing constraints, only two lanes of the G50 Fenhu station were opened, but with the approach of the peak return journey, a total of nine lanes in the station will be adjusted to actual conditions.
第一次全部开放9条车道是1月29日。
The first full nine lanes were opened on 29 January.
据杨海杰回忆，当天下午，因相邻省市突然宣布关闭境内G50所有的下匝口，造成上海出口车流量骤增，入沪车流最长排队延绵超过5公里。
Yang recalled that the afternoon of the same day, because neighboring provinces and municipalities suddenly announced the closure of all the G50 ramp, Shanghai's export traffic surged, the longest queue into Shanghai more than 5 kilometers.
开放全部车道，就意味着查控压力陡增，为了能做到严格防控，不留遗漏，杨海杰迅速召集了所有正在休息的民警、辅警全员上岗。
Opening the entire driveway means that the check pressure increased sharply, in order to achieve strict control, do not leave an omission, Yang Haijie quickly gathered all the rest of the civilian police, auxiliary police personnel on duty.
“在前置分流疏导岗设置2人，初检拦车岗设9人，复检引导岗设2人，复检区设2人，复检区车辆管理岗设2人，剩余的3人每人负责3根车道，做好初检拦车岗与复检引导岗之间的信息对接。
"2 in the front diversion guidepost, 9 in the preliminary check-up stop, 2 in the re-inspection guidance post, 2 in the re-inspection area, 2 in the vehicle management post in the recheck area, and 3 lanes each for the remaining 3 persons.
”杨海杰这样分工道。
"Yang Haijie division of labor.
最终，经过全体民警、辅警5个小时的共同努力，车流最终趋于平稳。
In the end, after all the police, auxiliary police 5 hours of joint efforts, the flow of vehicles eventually levelled off.
2月1日起，上海新冠肺炎疫情防控工作领导小组要求，所有从上海高速道口、机场、火车站入沪的旅客，都要先在“健康云”APP上填写来沪人员健康登记表。
Since February 1, the Leading Group for the Prevention and Control of the New Crown Pneumonia in Shanghai has required all passengers entering Shanghai from Shanghai expressway crossings, airports and railway stations to complete a health registration form on the "Health Cloud" APP.
从沪渝汾湖收费站入沪的外地人占总人数的70%，其中很多外地驾驶员不了解上海的规定，甚至一些人不善于使用手机APP，如何让每一辆车快速通过卡口又成了杨海杰面对的一个难题。
Many of the non-resident drivers don't understand the rules of Shanghai, and some of them are not good at using the APP. How to make each vehicle pass quickly through the gate has become a problem for Yang Haijie.
入沪人员手工填写健康登记表。
Staff entering Shanghai fill out the health registration form manually.
摄影：方卓然为了保证有条件网络登记健康信息的驾驶员在手机上登记，杨海杰在前端分流疏导岗位安排了大量的志愿者、辅警和保安，以帮助善于使用手机的驾驶员扫码登记。

杨海杰说，“对于实在不会使用手机APP的驾驶员，我们安排他们在收费卡口以手填的方式登记健康信息。
"For drivers who don't know how to use the APP, we arrange for them to register their health information manually at the toll gates," Yang said.
”同时，为了让入沪车辆快速通行，杨海杰还将收费口的9个车道划分为4个外地车入沪车道，3个货车入沪车道，和2个沪牌汽车入沪车道。
"Yang also divided the nine lanes at the toll gate into four foreign cars into the Shanghai lane, three trucks into the Shanghai lane and two Shanghai-brand cars into the Shanghai lane in order to allow fast vehicular access to Shanghai.
“专门开设沪牌车道，是因为通常沪牌车都是有固定住所的上海居民，这样可以减轻民警核查人员是否有入沪资格的工作，更方便管理。
"The only way to open Shanghai lanes is because normally Shanghai-brand cars are Shanghai residents with fixed residences. This will make it easier for civilian police inspectors to qualify for Shanghai, and easier to manage.
”他解释道。
'he explained.
2月10日，在上海市防控工作新闻发布会上，上海市防控工作领导小组、市交通委副主任杨小溪表示，在一级响应期间，上海对没有居住地、没有明确工作的人员，原则上加强劝返力度，令他们暂缓入沪。
At a press conference on February 10 in Shanghai, Yang Xiaoxiao, vice-director of the Shanghai Municipal Prevention and Control Working Group and vice-chairman of the city's transportation committee, said that during the first-level response period, Shanghai in principle stepped up efforts to persuade people with no place of residence and no clear job to stay in Shanghai.
在汾湖站，仅2月11日0至10时，杨海杰已劝返了7辆车共计15人。
At Fenhu Station on Feb. 11 alone, Yang Haijie has persuaded 7 vehicles to return a total of 15 people.
他说，“我们会根据人员的信息，在公安系统内部进行核实，如果来沪人员在上海并没有居住地，我们一律按照相关规定，对其进行严格劝返。
"We will check within the public security system according to the information of the personnel, and if the Shanghai-based personnel do not have a place of residence in Shanghai, we will strictly persuade them according to the relevant regulations," he said.
”为了保证每一个被劝返的对象都按原路返回，杨海杰和他的同事们会没收劝返司机的身份证和驾驶证，然后由民警开路引领司机驾驶到离沪的公路，确保劝返的司机无法掉头入沪后，民警再将证件予以返还。
To make sure everyone he is persuaded to return to Shanghai, Yang and his colleagues confiscate the driver's identification and driver's license and then drive the driver down the road to Shanghai to ensure that the driver will not be able to turn around and return the documents.
杨海杰表示，为了实行人性化管理，其实上海并没有一刀切死所有没有居住地的人员入沪，“比如针对来上海乘坐飞机去往外地的人，只要他们出示相关的飞机票和证件，并做好登记，我们也会予以放行。
Yang said that in order to implement humane management, Shanghai has not killed all people without a place of residence across the board. "For example, people coming to Shanghai by air to travel to other places will be released as long as they show the relevant tickets and documents and are registered," he said.
”为保证每人必检，除了测体温、检查是否填写健康信息登记表外，公安民警还要求所有车主打开后备厢或卡车货厢以供检查。
To make sure everyone must be checked, the police require all owners to open the trunk or trunk of a truck for inspection, in addition to a temperature check and a health information registration form.
杨海杰说，“可能有人会选择藏在后备厢里混进上海，这给我们提了醒，检查的时候不能有死角，所以我们是逢车必开后备厢。
'Someone may choose to hide in the trunk and sneak into Shanghai, 'Mr. Yang said.' It reminds us that there must be no dead ends when checking, so we're going to have to open the trunk.
”公安民警检查货车车厢。
The police inspected the wagons.
