孔特表示，意大利政府认为这是必须采取的严厉措施，以避免疫情在全国范围内进一步扩散。
Conte said the Italian government believes this is a drastic measure that must be taken to prevent the disease from spreading further across the country.
“我们所有人都必须为了意大利的利益而放弃一些东西。
"We must all give up something for the good of Italy.
”孔特在讲话中指出，“我们现在必须做此决定，只有我们大家共同努力，适应这些更严格的措施，我们才能最终做到。
"We have to make this decision now," he said in his speech. "Only if we all work together to adapt to these more stringent measures can we finally achieve it.
”俄罗斯RT则称这项举措“史无前例”。
Russia's RT called the move "unprecedented."
俄罗斯RT报道，孔特表示，现在不会只有一个“红区”，整个意大利都将被划为“红区”，除工作或健康等理由外，任何人不准离开居住地，全面禁止意大利各地的任何公共集会、体育赛事和活动。
According to Russian RT, there will not be just one "red zone" and the whole of Italy will be classified as a "red zone," with no one allowed to leave their place of residence except for reasons of work or health, and a total ban on all public gatherings, sporting events and events across Italy, Russian RT reported.

据环球时报，一位业内人士表示，作为一个欧洲国家，意大利全国封城的严厉措施已出乎意料，做到像武汉那样彻底、绝对，难度很大。
According to the Global Times, a person in the industry said that as a European country, Italy's national blockade of the harsh measures have been unexpected, like Wuhan as thorough, absolute, difficult.
他表示，意大利的封城与中国的含义是不同的。
He said the Italian city was not the same as China's.
封城的社会成本很高，且在欧美国家是政治不正确的，美国等国家可能很难效仿。
The social costs of sealing the city are high, and politically incorrect in Europe and the US, where it may be difficult for countries like the US to follow suit.
世卫组织总干事谭德塞3月9日表示，不同国家有不同的具体情况，需要采取有的放矢的应对措施。

意总理府则回应称，食品及生活用品的供应将得到保障，且购买生活必需品也属于人员流动管控的例外范围，不会受到相关措施阻挠或惩罚，民众不必囤积。
The Italian Prime Minister's Office responded that the supply of food and daily necessities would be guaranteed and that the purchase of essential goods would be subject to exceptions to the movement control regime and would not be obstructed or punished by the relevant measures, and that the population would not have to hoard them.
但各地超市仍出现意面、罐头食品被一扫而空的现象。
But supermarkets around the world still have spaghetti and canned food swept away.

Insider business reported that prisoners in the prison also felt constrained by the announcement by the Italian Government on 8 August that the northern part of the country had been closed, as the closure had affected visits by prisoners' families.
