虽然没有开学，江湖上依然流传着《黄冈密卷》的传说。
Although did not start school, the river and lake still spread the legend of "Huanggang secret volume."

点击上方物质生活参考加星标！物质生活参考作者：彭梁洁来源：物质生活参考（ID：wzshck）01.疫情期间，网上流传着一则关于黄冈的新闻：湖北武穴（黄冈下辖代管的一个县级市）最严管控：非疫情防控人员上街被抓的，一律送到市体育馆学习，然后完成初中三年级的《黄冈密卷》一张，成绩及格者可以放回家。
01.During the outbreak, a news item about Huanggang spread around the Internet: Hubei Wuxuang (a county-level city under Huanggang administration): Anyone caught on the street by non-epidemic prevention and control personnel is sent to the city gymnasium, where they can complete the Huanggang Concealed Book for the third grade of junior high school.
这则假新闻流传甚广，太多人信以为真，绝对是深谙互联网传播之道的一次成功的假新闻操作。
The fake news spread so widely that too many people believe it is a successful fake news operation that knows how to spread the Internet.
因为它描述的事件完全符合外界对这座城市的了解——《黄冈密卷》早已冲出圈层，成为黄冈这座大别山南麓鄂东城市的地标；同时基于很多人学生时代都经历过的被《黄冈密卷》支配的恐惧心理，在疫情期间化身为防止人们出门的“威慑武器”，合情合理。
Because the events it describes fit perfectly with the outside world's understanding of the city - the Huanggang Scroll has long since emerged as a landmark in the eastern city of Huanggang, the southern foothills of the Dabie Mountains.
在这次疫情中，《黄冈密卷》还因其“礼轻情意重”，完全具备了“礼品属性”，在网友眼中成为黄冈答谢外界帮助的桥梁：郑爽团队向黄冈定点捐款捐物，网友呼呼黄冈市向其粉丝赠送《黄冈密卷》作为感谢；山东在“一省包一市”对口支援黄冈，网友又给出建议，等疫情结束，黄冈再送山东几车试卷，不知山东的学生们是该哭还是该笑；黄冈景区宣布为山东湖南医务人员终身免票的微博下，不少网友又提议，《黄冈密卷》也终身免费赠送吧。
In this outbreak, "Huanggang secret volume" because of its "gift", fully equipped with "gifts" in the eyes of the netizens Huanggang donation to Huanggang targeted donations, Huanggang City friends Huanggang City to support their fans as a thank-you, Shandong Province Bao City, Shandong Province for medical staff life-long free Weibo, many netizens also proposed, "Huang Gang secret volume" free of charge for life.
其实山东是不必送的。
Actually Shandong does not have to send.
要知道，山东也是教育大省，有“教辅界三巨头”之称的，除了《黄冈密卷》的主编王后雄，另外两个让我们同样“闻之色变”的名字——《志鸿优化》的任志鸿、《教材全解》的薛金星——都来自山东，两地实力可谓不相上下。
As you know, Shandong is also a big province of education, known as the Big Three, except for Queen Xiong, editor-in-chief of Huanggang Secrets, and two other names that have made us feel the same way, namely, Ren Zhihong of Zhihong Optimization and Xue Jinsheng of Textbook Commentaries, are from Shandong Province.
多年以后，当人们追忆最美好的学生时代，跃入脑海的画面除了隔壁班的女孩和窗外的蝉鸣，一定还有自己对着“三巨头”抓耳挠腮的窘态。
Years later, as people recalled the best of student days, images popped into their heads -- except for the girl next door and the cicadas chirruping outside the window -- and certainly scratching their faces at the Big Three.
可别小瞧了这些薄薄的书本和淡如水的“教辅之交”。
Do not underestimate these thin books and indifferent "auxiliary friends."
日前拼多多新消费研究院统计的“宅家十大热销商品”，教辅教材榜上有名；京东图书和当当网销量最高图书前十位里，教辅教材占据了大半壁江山。
The top ten most-sold books are in the top 10, with teaching aids accounting for most of the top 10 books sold by Jingdong Books and Dangdang Internet.
从最近的两则相关新闻可以看出教辅在人民生活中的地位。
From the two recent related news can be seen in the role of teaching aids in people's lives.
第一则，《新华书店恢复开店，迎来首批读者，教辅材料受热捧》报道中描述：很多读者进店后都选择直奔设在负一楼的教辅材料区。
First, Xinhua Bookstore reopened, welcomed the first readers, teaching aids are hot reported: many readers have chosen to go straight to the negative first floor of the teaching materials section.
70多岁的赵大妈是首位结账出店的读者，她挑选了厚厚一摞教辅材料“。
Zhao, a 70-year-old mother who was the first reader to check out, chose a thick stack of teaching aids.
这些都是孩子需要的。
These are all children's needs.
”她说“，本来过完年后，孩子应该上三年级下学期了。
"After the year, the kids were supposed to be in the second semester of third grade," she said.
可因为疫情影响，迟迟没有开学，所以孩子的父母就让我到书店买点参考书。
But because of the epidemic, it was too late to start school, so my parents sent me to the bookstore to buy some reference books.
”第二则，近日，山东某地就教材配送业务面向社会公开招标，各大快递公司纷纷参与竞标。
"Second, a local school in Shandong recently opened a public tender for the distribution of textbooks, with major express delivery companies bidding.
报道称：中标的邮政快递事业部全体人员参与到这场紧急战斗中，从晚上18点一直到次日凌晨2点，经连续8个多小时的紧张奋战，针对不同类型学生的课程组合，终于完成2000多件不同组合包裹的分拣、封装工作，早上7点将邮件全部发出，早上8点开始配送。
After more than eight hours of intense fighting over eight hours of intense work, the winning postal and express department finally sorted and packaged more than 2,000 packages in different combinations, sending them all out at 7 a.m. and distributing them from 8 a.m., the newspaper said.
中高考临近，这些教材在某种程度上撑起了一个孩子乃至一个家庭的希望。
College entrance examination approaches, these teaching materials to a certain extent support a child and even a family hope.
知名电竞主播PDD在一次直播中提到往事：粉丝上课看我直播，手机被收了找我赔，我反手给他买了三套《黄冈密卷》，“一套不够，两套巩固”。
I bought him three sets of "Huanggang Conundrum," "One is not enough, the other is two," said PDD in a live broadcast: fans watch me live in class, the mobile phone was received to compensate me, I bought him three sets of "Huanggang secret volume," "not enough, two sets of consolidation.
PDD去年上《吐槽大会》时曾告诫年轻人，专职电竞是一条非常难走的路，除非确认自己是“百万分之一”的天才，否则还是回去刷教辅吧。
PDD warned young people last year at the Spit-Troupe conference that full-time telecommuting was a tough road to take, and unless you're a millionaire genius, go back and brush up on it.
算得上三观端正的电子竞技玩家了。
It's a good three-point rodeo player.
在这次疫情中，被教辅拯救的不仅是众多宅家深受熊孩子“折磨”的父母们，还有线下实体书店。
In this epidemic, not only were the parents of many homeowners "tortured" by bear children rescued, but also the offline physical bookstore.
已持续多年的实体书店倒闭潮之下，一些书店依靠出售教辅勉力维持，在这场疫情中，教辅教材更是成为雪上加霜中小书店珍贵的现金流来源。
With bookstores struggling to keep up with years of physical bookstore failure, teaching aids have become a valuable cash flow source for small and medium-sized bookstores amid the epidemic.
例如《第一财经》的一篇报道称，“营业额仅为以往一成，实体书店靠众筹、教辅、直播支撑”。
For example, a report in First Finance said: "Turnover is only 10% in the past, physical bookstores rely on public financing, teaching, live support."
02.被冠以“黄冈”之名的教辅，除了《黄冈密卷》，还有我们非常熟悉的《黄冈小状元》。
The teaching assistants, dubbed "Huang Gang," in addition to the "Huanggang Book of Secrets," are well-known to us as "The Wanggang Miniature."
但奇特的是，二者都与曾经被称为“黄冈神话”的黄冈中学无关，只是召集了一群来自黄冈地区的一线教师和教育专家编写。
But, oddly enough, both have nothing to do with the Huanggang School, once known as the "Huanggang Myth," except for a group of front-line teachers and education experts from the Huanggang region.
《黄冈小状元》由龙门书局出版，“小状元”系列是其“镇社之宝”之一，另一“宝”是同样能触发我们回忆开关的《三点一测》。
"Huang Gang small shape" published by the Longmen Shu Bureau, "small yuan" series is one of its "town treasure", another "treasure" is also able to trigger our recall switch "31test.
成立于上世纪30年代的龙门书局被誉为教辅出版界“三架马车”之一，20世纪初又被评为“文教新六家”——除了龙门书局，还有陕西师大、广西师大、山西教育、中国少年儿童出版社、东北师大。
Founded in the 1930s, the Longmen Bookstore was hailed as one of the three "horse-drawn buggies" in teaching and publishing, and was named as one of the six new schools of literature and education in the early 20th century.
至于由新疆青少年出版社所出《黄冈密卷》的“真假”，黄冈中学早在十几年前就做出澄清：《黄冈密卷》和学校没有任何关系，试题也并非来自黄冈中学，学校现在在职的老师没有参与编写，学校的学生也不会去做《黄冈密卷》。
As for the "true and false" Huanggang Concealment published by Xinjiang Youth Publishing House, Huang Gang Middle School has clarified more than a decade ago that "The Huanggang Concealment" has nothing to do with the school and the test questions are not written by Huanggang Middle School.
声明一出，许多人大呼上当，但此噱头经久不衰，或许可以印证黄冈曾经在教育界的声望和影响力。
Many have been duped by the announcement, but the stunt has survived, perhaps confirming Huanggang's reputation and influence in education.
黄冈中学有自己的教辅，但并不对外公开出版，只供内部使用。
Wong Kang Secondary School has its own teaching aids, but they are not published publicly and are only for internal use.
而《黄冈密卷》“背后的男人”王后雄，也是一位土生土长的黄冈人，也曾在黄冈本地中学任教，他对此回应称：“我所主编的黄冈系列教辅完全是黄冈教育方法、经验、理念的提炼和体现，并不是借用或滥用了“黄冈”这个品牌。
"In response to the" Huanggang Secret "Queen Xiong, a native-born Huanggang native who also teaches at a local secondary school," my editor-in-chief's Huang Gang series is a distillation and embodiment of Huanggang educational methods, experiences and concepts, not a borrowing or abuse of the Huanggang brand.
”王后雄堪称湖北教育界的传奇人物。
Queen Hung is a legend in Hubei education circles.
上世纪80年代，化学专业的王后雄在黄冈下辖某县中学任教，以别具一格的教学方式带着班级在全县化学统考中名列第一，接着调入黄冈一中，因90年代出版的奥数教辅《高中化学竞赛基础教程》，以及21世纪初出版的《化学重难点手册》扬名全国。
In the 1980s, the Queen Hsiung of Chemistry majored in a high school in Huanggang. He led her class to the top of the county's chemistry exam, then transferred to Huanggang No.1 Middle School.
他曾被评为湖北省特级教师，当选湖北省第九届人大代表，享受国务院政府特殊津贴。
He was once named a top-class teacher in Hubei Province and was elected deputy to the 9th NPC in Hubei Province.
2001年以来，王后雄一直在华中师范大学任教。
Queen Hsiung has been teaching at Central China Normal University since 2001.
在学校化学院官网上可以查到：王后雄目前身兼数职——华中师范大学教授、博士生导师、教师教育学院副院长、化学教育研究所所长、校考试科学研究中心主任。
She is currently a professor at the Central China Normal University, a doctoral supervisor, the vice-dean of the Faculty of Teacher Education, the Director of the Institute of Chemical Education and the Director of the School Examinations and Scientific Research Centre.
值得一提的是，王后雄的商业头脑与其教研水平同样难得。
It is worth mentioning that Queen Xiong's business acumen is as rare as her level of teaching and research.
据天眼查数据显示，目前他担任1家公司的法定代表人和5家公司的股东。
He is currently the legal representative of a company and a shareholder in five companies, according to Skyeye.
当然，与王后雄同在“三巨头”之列的其他两位，生意都做得不错。
Of course, the other two, who are part of the Big Three with the Queen, are doing a good job.
任志鸿担任董事长和总经理的世纪天鸿于2017年登陆创业板；薛金星也成立了金星国际教育集团，共持股15家公司。
Century Sun Hung, chairman and general manager of Ren Zhihong, landed in GEM in 2017, and Xue founded Venus International Education Group, which owns 15 companies.
实际上，教辅不仅是书店的救星，也是出版界的香饽饽——纯文学、小众作品不好买，畅销书要“碰运气”，只有教辅是“刚需”。
Indeed, teaching aids are not only the savior of bookstores, but also a hot spot in the publishing world - pure literature, minority works are difficult to buy, best sellers to "take a chance," only teaching assistants are "just need."
从历史中走来的新华书店，营收主要来源即为教辅。
From the history of Xinhua bookstore, the main source of revenue is teaching auxiliary.
国家新闻出版署公布的数据显示，2017年我国图书市场整体规模约为1800亿码洋，其中教育出版市场规模约为1100亿码洋，是图书出版市场中最大的门类。
According to data released by the State Press and Publication Administration, the overall book market in 2017 will be about 180 billion yards, of which the educational publishing market will be 110 billion yards, making it the largest category in the book publishing market.
“全国近600家出版社中，90%的出版社出版教辅。
"Of the nearly 600 publishing houses in the country, 90 percent publish auxiliary publications.
在全国3万多个书店中，有近80%的书店经营教辅图书。
Nearly 80 per cent of the country's more than 30,000 bookstores operate auxiliary books.
”一位业内人士说。
'said one industry insider.
[1]03.称霸90年代的“教辅三巨头”在新世纪迎来一个强大的竞争对手，将“三巨头”格局扭转为“四大天王”，这个新入局者就是让高考生们闻风丧胆的——曲一线公司出品的《5年高考3年模拟》，圈内简称《五三》。
The Big Three, which dominated the 1990s, ushered in a formidable competitor in the new century, turning the Big Three into a "Big Four," a newcomer to the Big Four - Qu's three-year simulation of the 5-year college entrance examination, known as "Five Years of College Entrance Examination."
“当你的生命还剩下八年，你会做什么？”“《五年高考三年模拟》。
What will you do when you have eight years left in your lifeFive-Year College Entrance Exam Three-Year Simulation
”这句调侃在高三学生之间流传。
"The joke spread among senior high school students.
2017年王俊凯在备战高考期间，就收到好友刘昊然精心准备的生日礼物——一套《五三》。
In 2017 Wang Junkai in preparation for the college entrance examination, received a friend Liu Haoran carefully prepared birthday gift - a set of "May 3."
曲一线团队登上撒贝宁的节目《放学别走》2003非典那年，曲一线公司带着《五三》强势出道，以“将历年高考真题与日常教学知识点相结合”的思路，在位于北京亦庄的办公室里闯出新天地。
After school in 2003, the first-line company with a strong "May 3" to the "National College Entrance Examination" combined with the day-to-day teaching knowledge points, in the office in Beijing Yizhuang broke into a new world.
据曲一线公司官网显示，《五三》入选了“央视微博评选影响最深的九本书”——因为2014年“央视新闻”官微发起的“对你影响最大的一本书”的微调查中，《五年高考三年模拟》位列第七名，排在《红楼梦》和《围城》之前。
According to Qu's official website, "May 3" was selected as the "nine most influential books on CCTV Weibo" - ranking seventh in the "Three-Year Simulation of the Five-Year National Entrance Examination," ahead of "Dream of the Red Mansions" and "The Siege."
官网还显示，曲一线公司在此次驰援湖北行动中共捐款170多万，也算是“《五三》给《黄冈密卷》加油”了。
The official website also showed that Qu first-line companies in the operation to help Hubei donated more than 1.7 million, also known as "May 3" to "Huanggang secret volume" refueling.
在某种程度上，20世纪《五三》的崛起刚好踩在了“黄冈神话”没落的时间点上，这也是教育中心城市向东部沿海地区转移之时。
To some extent, the rise of the May 3rd in the 20th century coincided with the fall of the "Huanggang myth," when education centers shifted their cities to the eastern seaboard.
“2019中国百强中学排行”上，高居榜首的是位于武汉的华师一附中，湖北一共有4所学校上榜，黄冈中学不在其列。
At the top of the 2019 list of China's top 100 high schools is Wuhan-based Huashan-yi, which is one of four schools in Hubei province, excluding Huanggang Middle School.
黄冈中学从2015年起跌出100名之外，当年的“北四中(北京四中)，南黄冈(黄冈中学)”传说不复存在，这所百年老校默默承受着媒体报道中“跌下神坛”的形容，很少对外发声。
In addition to the fall of 100 from 2015, when the legend of "North Fourth Middle School (Beijing IV Middle School) and South Huanggang Middle School" disappeared, the 100-year-old school quietly endured the media coverage of the "fall from the altar", very little external voice.
电影《全城高考》即以黄冈中学为背景当年，“黄冈神话”有三大法宝：奥赛、高考和教辅。
The film "All-City College Entrance Examination" takes Huanggang Middle School as the background, "Huanggang myth" has three magic weapons: Osei, college entrance examination and teaching aids.
80年代的黄冈中学走出了国内第一位国际奥赛奖牌获得者；1990年国际奥赛首次在中国举办，黄冈中学的王崧获得金牌，次年又摘一金。
In the 1980s, Huang Gang Middle School emerged from the country's first international Olympic medallist. In 1990, the first international Olympic Games were held in China.
黄冈中学逐渐摸索出一条依靠奥赛成绩保送清华北大的的独特道路，“黄高9班”即这段历史的产物。
Huanggang Middle School gradually groped out a unique way to guarantee Tsinghua University by relying on the Olympic results, "Class 9 Huang Gao" is the product of this history.
这些获奖者的照片至今留在黄冈中学官网首页。
Photos of the winners remain on the front page of the official website.
如果感兴趣的话，可以从2008年出版的《黄冈中学教育神话解读》一书中了解这段历史。
If you are interested, you can learn about this history from the 2008 book "The Myth of Huang Gang's Middle School Education."
至于20世纪以来，种种因素交织，共同将黄冈中学“推下神坛”：新课改；因建新校区而高额举债，扩招导致非优质生源注入，从过去的“精英教育转向大众教育”；竞争激烈，本地顶尖生源被武汉的学校以优越条件挖走，黄冈的经济实力无法相抗衡，优质师资力量也因此流失；等等。
Since the 20th century, a variety of factors have combined to "push Huang Gang Middle School off the altar": the new curriculum reform; the high level of borrowing resulting from the construction of the new campus; the shift from elite education to mass education; fierce competition, whereby top local students are poached by Wuhan schools on favourable terms; Huanggang's economic power cannot compete with that of quality teachers; and so on.
前几年媒体做过大量报道。
Media coverage was extensive in previous years.
面对质疑，黄冈中学前任校长刘祥曾留下一句话：“黄冈中学正处在一个休养生息的阶段。
Facing the question, Liu Xiang, former headmaster of Huanggang Middle School, left a message: "Huanggang Middle School is in a period of recuperation.
黄冈中学现在位置尴尬：名气很大，但总是遭遇到各种非议。
Huang Gang middle school is now in an awkward position: famous, but always encountered all sorts of criticism.
我们好不容易这几年淡出了人们的视线，只想喘口气，静下心来，做自己该做的事情。
We have been out of sight for several years, just want to take a breath, calm down and do their own thing.
”直到2015年的黄冈教育工作会议，新上任的教育局长闻武斌在讲话中称“要重振黄冈教育雄风”，被媒体解读为“黄冈首提重振教育雄风”。
Wen Wubin, the new education minister, said in a speech until the education conference in Huanggang in 2015 that "to revitalize Huanggang education" was interpreted by the media as "the first time Huang mentioned reviving the spirit of education."
实际上，即便多年再没有出过状元，黄冈中学的高考成绩依然可圈可点。
In fact, even if many years have not been out of the top, Huanggang high school entrance examination results can still be commendable.
黄冈中学官网显示：2019年高考，一本率96.6%，985高校录取率38%，211高校录取率70%。
In 2019, the college entrance exam was 96.6 percent, admission to 985 colleges and universities was 38 percent, and admission to 211 colleges and universities was 70 percent, Huanggang official website showed.
对于一所位于经济欠发达地区、农村学生占比60%的中学来说，取得这样的成绩并不容易——2018年湖北省各市GDP排名，黄冈市总值第五，人均则排在16位，倒数第二。
For a secondary school in an economically underdeveloped region with a rural student population of 60%, this is not easy - Hubei province ranked fifth in terms of GDP in 2018, Huanggang ranked fifth, and per capita in the bottom 16 places.
3月18日，黄冈正式宣布疫情中“四类人员”清零。
March 18, Huang Gang officially declared the outbreak of "four categories of personnel" zero.
相信不久，坐落在黄州大道的黄梅戏大剧院内将再次奏响乐章，遗爱湖湿地公园会重新迎来携手的伴侣。
Before long, the Huangmei Opera Theater, located on Huangzhou Avenue, will play another piece of music.
也希望黄冈考生们在今年高考中取得好成绩。
Hopefully, Huanggang candidates will do well in the college entrance examination this year.
