疫情之下，看到这么多医护人员和科学家在夜以继日地奋斗着，只为了抗击疫情，作为一个青年科研人员，我想在我的学科领域范畴内，为祖国，为全世界做一份贡献。
In the face of the epidemic, I see so many medical personnel and scientists working around the clock to fight the epidemic. As a young scientist, I want to make a contribution to my country and the world within my field of expertise.
口述| 范梦真整理| 黄颖琳北京时间2020年2月25日下午6时，也就是英国时间早上10时，我的国内伙伴打来电话：“设备已经运到实验室了，也完成了初步安装工作！”我连日来悬着的心终于放下了，这个好消息让牛津连日来的阴天也变得不那么压抑。
At 6 p.m. Beijing time on 25 February 2020, at 10 a.m. British time, my domestic partner phoned to say: "The equipment has arrived at the laboratory and the initial installation work has been completed!" My heart hung over for days, and the good news has made Oxford's cloudy days less oppressive.
我捐赠的自动移液设备由上海某生物科技有限公司接收我名叫范梦真，现在是英国牛津大学化学系四年级博士生。
My donated automatic transfusion equipment was received by a Shanghai Biotech Co. Ltd. My name is Fan Mengzhen, now a fourth-year PhD student in Chemistry at Oxford University.
自新冠疫情暴发以来，我一直关注着国内的疫情动态，新冠肺炎（COVID-19）快速核酸检测诊断方式的话题很快引起了我的关注。
Since the outbreak of the new crown, I have been watching the dynamics of the epidemic at home, and the topic of rapid nucleic acid detection diagnosis for New Crown Pneumonia (COVID-19) has quickly caught my eye.
因为我的博士课题主攻方向，就是基因测序和癌症诊断技术, 核酸检测与我的研究领域十分契合。
Because my PhD major is in gene sequencing and cancer diagnosis, nucleic acid testing fits well into my field of research.
疫情开始之初，新冠肺炎如何确诊成为一大难题， 基于实时荧光反转录聚合酶链式反应（RT-PCR）技术的核酸检测成为一种重要诊断方法。
At the beginning of the outbreak, the diagnosis of new crown pneumonia was a difficult problem, and the detection of nucleic acid based on real-time fluorescence reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was an important diagnostic method.
这是我的专业领域，我想我的专业知识可以帮上忙，于是我马上联系上几家国内快速核酸检测试剂盒生产单位，和他们交流了基因测序和化学合成方面的经验。
This was my area of expertise, and I thought my expertise could help, so I immediately contacted several domestic rapid nucleic acid (RNA) test kit production units and shared their experiences in gene sequencing and chemical synthesis.
在跟他们沟通的过程中，我了解到随着疑似病患人数激增，试剂盒的生产压力也越来越明显。
In the course of communicating with them, I learned that as the number of suspected patients surged, the production pressure on the kit became more and more obvious.
我自己也是青年科研人员，知道试剂盒的生产涉及复杂的化学试剂和生物样品的加样移液操作，因此自动化设备对试剂盒生产非常重要。
As a young scientist myself, I know that the production of test kits involves complex chemical reagents and sample transfusion operations on biological samples, so automated equipment is very important for kit production.
在这种紧急情况下，试剂盒生产单位很难在短期内进行高质量的设备采购。
In such an emergency, it is difficult for test kit manufacturers to procure high-quality equipment in the short term.
美国产的OT-2自动移液工作站这时我想起，2019年，我的高中母校华东师范大学第二附属中学庆祝60周年校庆时，我曾向学校捐赠了一台美国产OT-2自动移液工作站，希望用于支持学校教学活动。
At this point, I recalled that in 2019, at the 60th anniversary celebration of my alma mater, the Second Affiliated Middle School of East China Normal University, I donated an American-made OT-2 automatic transfusion workstation to support school teaching activities.
作为一台具有工业4.0和物联网理念的自动化科研设备，其可以通过机械臂和特殊设计的高通量移液枪，来代替人手进行自动化的移液操作。
As an automated scientific equipment with industrial 4.0 and the concept of Internet of Things, it can replace the manual automatic transfusion operation with a robotic arm and specially designed high-throughput gun.
机械臂比人工移液速度快得多，且高度标准化的机械操作大大降低了人为失误的可能性。
The robotic arm moves much faster than manual transfusion, and highly standardized mechanical operations greatly reduce the possibility of human error.
只要原料供应充足，这台设备可以达到24小时满负荷运作。
The equipment can run at full capacity for 24 hours as long as the raw materials are available.
该移液枪比传统设备效率高出近100倍。
The transfusion gun is nearly 100 times more efficient than conventional equipment.
因此，这台科研设备在用于医疗产品生产的场景下，其精度、准度、工作效率和可靠性，都大大优于一般生产设备。
Therefore, the accuracy, accuracy, work efficiency and reliability of this scientific equipment are much better than the general production equipment in the production of medical products.
因此，我想如果把这台现有的科研设备提供给试剂盒生产单位，或可解燃眉之急。
Therefore, I think that if this existing scientific equipment to test kit production units, may solve the most urgent needs.
华东师大二附中教师迅速完成设备的打包工作出于这样的想法，我马上联系了高中母校，表达向试剂盒生产单位转赠设备的想法。
With this in mind, I immediately contacted my alma mater in high school to express my intention to transfer equipment to the kit manufacturing unit.
我的请求也马上得到了学校的大力支持。
My request was immediately supported by the school.
征得学校同意后，我便开始和伙伴们一起对国家卫健委指定的核酸检测试剂盒生产单位进行研判。
With the school's approval, I began working with my partners to determine the Nucleic Acid Testing Kit production unit designated by the National Board of Health.
在咨询专家意见后，我们综合考虑了企业的生产能力、人员配置以及特种设备运输等因素，最后决定把设备捐赠给上海某生物科技有限公司。
After consulting experts, we took into account the production capacity, staffing and special equipment transportation, and finally decided to donate the equipment to a Shanghai biotechnology limited company.
与此同时，华东师大二附中的领导和老师也马上行动起来，尽管处于寒假期间，他们还是回学校进行设备打包，在2020年2月18日紧急完成了设备的重新打包工作。
At the same time, the leaders and teachers of the Second Middle School of the East China Normal University also moved quickly, returning to school during the winter vacation to pack their equipment and urgently completing the repackaging of the equipment on 18 February 2020.
设备经专业物流公司运送到试剂盒生产单位，在调试成功后，用于支持包括核酸检测试剂盒在内的抗疫诊断产品的生产。
The equipment is transported to the kit production unit by a professional logistics company and, after debugging, is used to support the production of anti-epidemic diagnostic products, including nucleic acid test kits.
我通过微博@范氏科学科普新冠肺炎防护知识除了捐赠以外，我看新闻的时候，经常观察到不少人佩戴口罩的方式不正确，并不能起到有效的防护作用。
In addition to donations, I often observe that many people wear masks incorrectly when watching the news. They do not provide effective protection.
特别是针对N95 口罩这种平时很少使用的口罩，一些使用者并没有掌握正确的佩戴方法。
Especially for the N95 mask, which is rarely used in daily use, some users do not have the right way to wear it.
作为一个青年科学工作者，我觉得有义务向大家科普一些关于新冠肺炎（COVID-19）防护的知识。
As a young scientist, I feel obliged to give you some general knowledge about protection against new crown pneumonia (COVID-19).
于是，我开始自己拍摄一些科普小视频发在微博上，教大家戴口罩。
So I started making my own video clips of popular science on microblogs, teaching people to wear masks.
同时也通过短视频向大家科普了不同类型的口罩和防护指数，希望大家合理使用，不要浪费宝贵的医疗资源。
At the same time, we also popularized the different types of masks and protection index through short video, hope everybody uses reasonably, do not waste precious medical resources.
我从英国空运到广州的抗疫物资，我的小伙伴正在分装准备发往湖北各地随着疫情在欧洲的蔓延，英国也出现恐慌气氛，出现口罩短缺的情况。
With the spread of the epidemic in Europe, there has also been an atmosphere of panic and a shortage of face masks in Britain.
我此前购买了一些口罩，本是为了寄回国内的。
I bought some face masks before, which were supposed to be sent back to China.
事实上在疫情暴发之初，我便开始在英国筹措物资，向包括湖北、上海、北京、新疆、内蒙古、广西等11个省区市捐赠了24批次的医疗物资。
In fact, at the beginning of the outbreak, I began to raise materials in Britain and donated 24 batches of medical supplies to 11 provinces and municipalities, including Hubei, Shanghai, Beijing, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia and Guangxi.
如今，则开始在牛津大学校区组织免费派发口罩的活动，以缓解师生的焦虑情绪。
Now, free masks are being organized at the Oxford University campus to ease anxiety among teachers and students.
疫情之下，看到这么多医护人员和科学家在夜以继日地奋斗着，只为了抗击疫情，作为一个青年科研人员，我想在我的学科领域范畴内，为祖国，为全世界做一份贡献。
In the face of the epidemic, I see so many medical personnel and scientists working around the clock to fight the epidemic. As a young scientist, I want to make a contribution to my country and the world within my field of expertise.
