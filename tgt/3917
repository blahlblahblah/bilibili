美国的医疗条件虽然很好，医疗资源分配很平均，但是在新冠肺炎流行这种特殊情况下，无法做到统一管理，没有上层命令的约束，各管各的运行，是很难达到理想的效果的。
Although the medical conditions in the United States are very good and the distribution of medical resources is very equal, it is difficult to achieve the desired effect in the special case of the New Crown Pneumonia.
撰稿 | 石 头最近几天，医院在停车场附近开设了专门的Drive-thru测试，这是一种快速测试哨卡，不过工作人员的防护级别嘛，就很难说了。
Writing & # 124; # 124; Shek Tau In recent days, the hospital has opened a special Drive-Thru test near the parking lot, a rapid-test checkpoint, but the level of protection for staff is hard to say.
我是一名上海医生，从2019年5月起一直在美国加州湾区进行访问学者交流。
I am a Shanghai doctor and have been visiting scholars in the Bay Area of California since May 2019.
3月16日，旧金山湾区6个县宣布了公共封锁的“就地庇护令”（Shelter in place），要求辖区所有居民，从3月17日开始留在家里“避难”三个星期直至禁令解除。
On March 16, six counties in the San Francisco Bay area declared a "Shelter in place" for the public blockade, requiring all residents of the area to remain at home for three weeks from March 17 until the ban was lifted.
那么从1月21日美国出现首例确诊患者，这两个月以来，美国人民是如何进行预防的呢？禁令后往日车水马流的街道空无一人餐馆也被迫关门曾经关注点只有“外国人”今年1月起国内开始暴发新冠病毒的感染，对全国人民的生活都造成了很大的影响。
So how have Americans prevented the first confirmed cases in the United States since Jan. 21 Two months after the ban, empty streets were forced to close and only foreigners started to infect the country with the new crown virus, which has had a huge impact on the lives of the nation.
身处异乡的我不能回到自己熟悉的岗位上和大家一起并肩作战，但还是时刻关心着国内的情况。
In a foreign country I can not go back to their familiar posts to fight side by side, but still keep an eye on the situation at home.
由于加州这里的华人众多，和国内仍旧保持着十分密切的联系，因此，疫情暴发初期，这边的华人就已经开始行动起来，CVS，Costco等能买到口罩的地方都有华人的身影，有给自己买的，更多的是准备寄回国内，支援国内的家人。
Because of the large number of Chinese here in California and the fact that they still maintain very close ties with China, the Chinese here have started to act in the early stages of the outbreak. CVS, Costco and other places where masks can be bought include Chinese, who buy them for themselves and send them back home to support their families at home.
而在疫情的早期，由于美国这边的确诊病例都是输入性病例，因此，CDC的防控重心也是提高对入境的有过中国大陆旅游史的筛查工作，加强在机场的排查，甚至在2月初起就对有过中国大陆居住及旅游史的非美籍公民采取了禁止入境的措施，并提高对中国的旅行预防措施至“警告”的最高级别，避免不必要的出行。
In the early stages of the epidemic, as confirmed cases on the US side were imported cases, the CDC's focus was also on improving screening of incoming Chinese mainland tourism history, strengthening airport screening, and even banning non-US citizens with a history of Chinese residence and travel from the beginning of February to the highest levels of "warnings" to avoid unnecessary travel.
这是政府对外的口径，而事实上，在1月31日，特朗普宣布禁令的前一天，我去旧金山机场接从国内来的同事时，依旧没有看到任何需要检测及防护的措施，甚至都没有对入境的乘客进行体温测量，入关时，有一个专门的CDC工作区域，在工作日的早上十点多，这个区域就是一个摆设的存在，空无一人，连工作人员都没有，而对于入境的同事，也只是由海关人员询问了一下有无武汉旅游史，和平日并无任何区别。
In fact, the day before Trump's announcement on January 31, I went to San Francisco airport to pick up my colleagues from home, where I still did not see anything to check and protect, not even to measure the temperature of incoming passengers.
依旧繁忙的旧金山机场3月之前，囤货的基本是华人而政府对内则一再强调传播风险很低，只需做好个人清洁卫生，无需戴口罩。
Before March at San Francisco's still-busy airport, the Chinese were largely hoarding goods and the government had repeatedly stressed at home that the risk of spreading the disease was low.
每年11月至次年4月，美国都处于流感季节，常见的咳嗽、发热、肌肉酸痛等不适症状一般都不会去就医，因此，各个医院也没有特别的发热门诊，学校依旧正常上课，医院里除了手术室以外，没人戴口罩，大家见面依旧握手致意，热情拥抱，甚至在手术室外的走廊上，相互聊天时口罩都已脱掉。
Every year from November to April, the United States is in the flu season. Common cough, fever, muscle aches and pains are not usually treated. As a result, hospitals do not have special fever clinics, schools continue to operate normally, hospitals are not covered with masks except for operating rooms, people still shake hands, hug warmly, and even chat outside the operating room when the masks are removed.
我所在的医院是一所大型私立医院，很少会有发热病人直接来就诊的，我们科室的教授每周一天门诊，当天会有三十多个患者就诊，都是提前预约好的，分散在不同的时间段，而且为了保证每个患者的隐私，门诊都有单独的等待室。
My hospital is a large private hospital, few patients with fever come directly to the clinic. Our department's professors go out one day a week, more than 30 patients are seen there in advance, at different times, and in order to ensure the privacy of each patient, there is a separate waiting room.
因此不会像国内一样专家门诊门口大排长龙、热闹非凡的现象。
Therefore will not resemble the domestic expert outpatient clinic the long queue, the feverish phenomenon.
在国内如火如荼的进行各种防范治疗病毒的工作时，美国这边的感觉就是“一副事不关己高高挂起的姿态，反正我已经关闭入境门槛，病毒是不会进来的”。
As the nation rushes ahead with its efforts to prevent and treat the virus, the US side feels "like I'm off the hook, and the virus won't come in anyway."
到了2月中下旬，随着更多“不明原因社区传播病例”的出现，最早感知情况不妙的华人们又开始行动了，这个时候去超市的时候会发现，米、面、米粉都货物都会出现短缺，尤其在99 Ranch，Marina等华人超市，而速食的披萨、大份肉类、厕纸等依旧摆满了货架，这种风格一看就是华人囤货的类型。
By the middle and second half of February, as more cases of "unexplained community transmission" appeared, the first Chinese to perceive the situation began to move again. When they went to the supermarket, they found that rice, noodles and rice flour were in short supply, especially at the 99 Ranch, Marina and other Chinese supermarkets.
后知后觉的美国人似乎还没有意识到病毒的影响已经越来越近，学校的食堂、图书馆等人员密集的地方除了张贴勤洗手的建议公告外，一切还是和往常一样，排队吃饭，聚会聊天，而且……不戴口罩。
Later-stage Americans don't seem to realize that the virus is getting closer and closer. School canteens, libraries and other densely populated areas are lined up to eat, chat, and... wear masks, as usual, in addition to the advice to post frequent hand-washing notices.
华人风格的囤货，只抢大件米面这个阶段，除了在周末的华人超市，能看到营业员和三三两两的中国人戴着口罩，其他情况下，还是没人戴口罩做防护，毕竟在西方的思维中，戴口罩的都是生病的人，健康人是不需要的。
Chinese-style hoarding, only large rice noodle stage, in addition to the weekend in the Chinese supermarket, you can see salespeople and three or two Chinese wearing masks, in other cases, no one wearing masks, after all in Western thinking, wearing masks are sick people, healthy people do not need.
很多当地华人担心受到歧视而一直没敢戴口罩。
Many local Chinese have not dared to wear masks for fear of discrimination.
校园集会依旧热闹非凡对于我们这些访问学者来说，由于经常要在医院的手术室出入，戴着口罩并不是很显眼的事情，因此上班时我们都会刻意戴好口罩。
For those of us visiting scholars who often have to come and go in the operating rooms of hospitals wearing masks is not a noticeable thing, so we wear them deliberately at work.
但在日常生活中，我们并没有像国内一样，一直戴着口罩出门，主要原因还是因为地广人稀，就算你平时走在马路上，也不会碰到几个人，唯一的防护措施就是避开高峰去超市购买生活品。
But in our daily life, we do not always wear masks, as the main reason is because the land is so sparse, even if you walk on the street, you will not meet a few people, the only protection is to avoid the peak to the supermarket to buy goods.
3月后，上网课、少手术，但不“强制”转折点出现在3月份，这时候医院职工和学校学生都已经有出现确诊病例了，学校提早放春假，开始网上授课及考试，禁止校内任何聚会活动。
After March, Internet classes, fewer surgeries, but no "mandatory" turning points appeared in March, when hospital staff and school students were diagnosed with cases. Schools started early spring break, began online classes and exams, and banned all school-based gatherings.
学校食堂的自助餐变成了外带，不允许任何堂吃。
The buffet in the school cafeteria became a takeaway and no one was allowed to eat it.
所有食物统一打包，进行外带实验室的同学接到通知，实验室关闭等待进一步通知。
All food is packed together, take-out labs are notified, labs are closed for further notification.
医院要求评估所有已预约手术和预约患者，尽可能减少不必要的手术和门诊，科室也将病例讨论的会议转成网络讨论。
Hospitals require assessment of all scheduled surgeries and appointments to minimize unnecessary surgeries and outpatient consultations, and sections have converted case discussion sessions into network discussions.
但这些都不是强制性措施，只是分散给各个科室自行安排。
These measures, however, are not mandatory and are only decentralized to individual sections.
确实很让人担忧。
It's really worrying.
毕竟按照国内的经验来看，如果一个医院无法将确诊病例、疑似病例及健康病例合理分流的话，在目前没有特效药的情况下，只会进一步增加感染的风险。
After all, according to domestic experience, if a hospital is unable to properly divert confirmed cases, suspected cases, and health cases, the current lack of specific drugs will only further increase the risk of infection.
我觉得，美国的医疗条件虽然很好，医疗资源分配很平均，但是在新冠肺炎流行这种特殊情况下，无法做到统一管理，没有上层命令的约束，各管各的运行，是很难达到理想的效果的。
I think the medical conditions in the United States are very good and the distribution of medical resources is very equal, but in the special case of the New Crown Pneumonia, it is very difficult to achieve the desired results without unified management and the control of the operation of the upper echelons.
