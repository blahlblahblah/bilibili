SARS 冠状病毒于 2002 年 11 月登陆中国广东，引爆中国后迅速传播至越南、新加坡等周边国家，最终传播至全球 29 个国家和地区。
The SARS coronavirus, which landed in Guangdong, China in November 2002, exploded in China and spread to neighboring countries including Vietnam and Singapore, and eventually to 29 countries and regions around the world.
根据世界卫生组织（World Health Organization, WHO）的数据，截止至 2003 年 7 月，全球共有 8096 例确诊，其中 774 人死亡。
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 8,096 cases had been diagnosed worldwide as of July 2003, of which 774 had died.
那么，当年的 SARS，最终是怎么消失的呢？SARS何时来，何时去？1 初露端倪2003年2月11日，WHO 收到一份中国卫生部的报告，其中记述了一种急性呼吸系统综合征。
So how did SARS eventually disappear? When did SARS come and when did it goOn February 11, 2003, the WHO received a report from the Ministry of Health of China describing an acute respiratory syndrome.
报告称，广东省已经出现305例病例，其中5人死亡。
The report says 305 cases have been reported in Guangdong province, five of them fatal.
回溯性研究认为，首个病例发生在 2002年11月16日。
A retrospective study concluded that the first case occurred on 16 November 2002.
人们对于这种疾病尚不了解，仅能确定这不是某种流感，而且患者的症状为非典型肺炎（SARS其实是“非典型肺炎”的一种）。
The disease is not known, only to be sure it is not a form of flu, and the patient's symptoms are atypical pneumonia (SARS is actually one of "atypical pneumonia").
第一例被公开报道的 SARS 患者是一名 64 岁的广东医生［2］。
The first publicly reported case of SARS was a 64-year-old Guangdong doctor.
这位患者于 2003 年 2 月 21 日前去香港观光旅游，并且入住了酒店 M。
The patient travelled to Hong Kong on February 21, 2003 and was admitted to Hotel M.
5 天前在广东时他就略感不适，到了香港边玩边逛一天后，患者症状加重，并因呼吸衰竭被送进重症监护病房。
He became slightly unwell when he was in Guangdong five days ago. After a day in Hong Kong, the patient's symptoms worsened and he was taken to intensive care because of respiratory failure.
他先前曾在广东救治过非典型肺炎的患者，他告诉医生，担心自己染上了“非常致命的疾病”。
He had previously treated SARS patients in Guangdong and told doctors he feared he was suffering from a "very fatal disease."
随后，SARS 在与他接触的家人、同酒店的游客、诊治他的医务工作者之间聚集性暴发，由此 SARS 在香港流行开来。
SARS then became prevalent in Hong Kong with an outbreak of agglomeration among his family, hotel guests and the medical staff who treated him.
同住旅馆的游客来自世界各地，他们无意间又将 SARS 带到了加拿大、美国、新加坡、越南和爱尔兰等国（图1）。
Travellers from around the world unwittingly brought SARS to countries such as Canada, the United States, Singapore, Vietnam and Ireland (Figure 1).
最终，全世界有 29 个国家和地区出现了 SARS 病例。
As a result, 29 countries and territories around the world have reported SARS cases.
为 SARS 冠状病毒“连通世界”的酒店 M｜参考文献[1]2 全球暴发2003年3月中旬，WHO 定义了这种疾病的主要症状，包括高烧、咳嗽、呼吸急促或困难等，并将其命名为严重急性呼吸综合征(severe acute respiratory syndrome)，也就是 SARS。
WHO defines the main symptoms of the disease, including fever, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty, as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), or SARS, in mid-March 2003.
同时，WHO 发布了全球警报［3］，宣布 SARS 已经成为“全球性的健康威胁”，需要联合多个国家的卫生部门，共同遏制疾病的流行。
Meanwhile, the World Health Organization has issued a Global Alert [3], declaring that SARS has become a "global health threat," requiring the health ministries of several countries to work together to contain the disease.
在进一步明确病原体之前，WHO 建议隔离 SARS 患者。
Until the pathogen is further clarified, the WHO recommends isolation of SARS patients.
鉴于 SARS 在中国、新加坡、加拿大局部流行，WHO 建议，在暴发地区起飞的航线，航空公司对乘客进行健康检查；4月，WHO发布了多份旅游建议。
With SARS endemic in parts of China, Singapore and Canada, the World Health Organization recommends that airlines screen passengers for health on routes that take off in areas of outbreak; in April, the World Health Organization issued several travel advisories.
在对旅客进行健康筛查之后，未再报告有新的与飞行相关的病例 | Pixabay虽然在广东的 2 例死亡病例中发现了衣原体感染，因而衣原体曾一度被认为是 SARS 的病原，但随着病例越来越多，研究者们逐渐锁定了“真凶”。
After health screening, no new flight-related cases were reported. Pixabay was once thought to be the cause of SARS, although chlamydia was found in two deaths in Guangdong, but as the number of cases grew, researchers gradually locked in the true killer.
4 月 16 日，在完成基因组测序之后［4］，他们宣布，这是一种全新的冠状病毒：SARS－CoV——至此，当年的新型冠状病毒终于露出了真面目。
On April 16, [4] after completing genome sequencing, they announced that it was a completely new coronavirus: SARS-CoV - so that the new coronavirus of that year finally showed its true face.
另外，在 5 月 23 日发表的一项研究中，研究者在野味市场的果子狸中检测到了与 SARS 病毒高度相关的病毒；加上前期超过三分之一的病例都是餐饮业人员，这项研究进一步推进了 SARS 暴发与食用野生动物的关系。
Moreover, in a study published on May 23, researchers detected highly related viruses in beavers at game markets; together with the fact that more than one-third of all cases in the previous period were in the restaurant industry, the study furthered the relationship between the SARS outbreak and wildlife consumption.
SARS 的疫情在 5 月初达到高峰。
The SARS epidemic peaked in early May.
4 月 23 日，全球总共报告了超过 4000 例病例，4 月 28 日达到 5000 例，5 月 2 日超过 6000 例，5 月 8 日超过 7000 例——平均每天新增约 200 例。
On April 23, more than 4,000 cases were reported globally, reaching 5,000 on April 28, more than 6,000 on May 2, and more than 7,000 on May 8 - an average of about 200 new cases a day.
随后，新增感染的速度减缓；直到 6 月，新增数已减少至每日几例。
Subsequently, the rate of new infections slowed; until June, the increase was reduced to a few cases per day.
根据WHO数据绘制的SARS病例（橙色）和死亡病例（红色）曲线 |Phoenix7777 / Wikimedia Commons与此同时，WHO 陆续将多个城市从“最近发生本地传播的地区”名单中删除。
WHO figures show SARS cases (orange) and deaths (red) at its service. At the same time, Phoenix 7777 / Wikimedia Commons, WHO has moved cities off its list of 'recently transmitted areas.
6 月 24 日，对于疫情暴发最严重的北京，WHO 取消了对北京的旅行建议，同时将其从本地传播地区的名单中删除；此时，距离北京最后一例确诊病人被隔离，已经过去了超过 20 天。
On June 24, in Beijing, the worst outbreak, the World Health Organization cancelled travel advisories to Beijing and removed it from its list of endemic areas, more than 20 days after Beijing's last confirmed case was quarantined.
在将加拿大多伦多、中国台湾从本地传播地区名单中删除之后，2003 年 7 月 5 日，WHO 宣布，已经在全球范围内控制了 SARS 的暴发，但仍然需要保持警惕。
After removing Toronto, Canada, and Taiwan, China from the list of locally transmitted areas, the World Health Organization announced on July 5, 2003 that it had brought the SARS outbreak under control globally, but that vigilance was still needed.
3 小规模暴发2003年下半年至 2004 年上半年，大规模的SARS流行结束，但仍发生了 4 次小规模的暴发。
Small-scale outbreaks occurred between the second half of 2003 and the first half of 2004, when the large-scale SARS epidemic ended, but there were four small-scale outbreaks.
其中 3 起与研究冠状病毒的实验室有关，1 起与接触中间宿主（如果子狸）有关。
Three of the incidents were related to laboratory studies on coronavirus and one to exposure to an intermediate host such as a civet.
所以，严格控制致病的病毒株［5］、控制可能的动物中间宿主，对预防 SARS 再发极为重要。
Therefore, strict control of pathogenic virus strains [5] and control of possible intermediate hosts in animals is essential to prevent the recurrence of SARS.
自 2004 年中至今，全球未再有新的 SARS 病例报道。
No new cases of SARS have been reported worldwide since mid-2004.
关于SARS消失的猜想从 2002 年 11 月到 2003 年 7 月，从初露端倪到几乎绝迹，SARS 耗时整整 9 个月。
Speculation about the disappearance of SARS lasted from November 2002 to July 2003, when SARS took nine months to emerge and almost disappear.
SARS 最终为何会消失？17 年过去，这个问题仍然没有确定的答案。
Seventeen years later, there is still no definitive answer to the question why SARS eventually disappeared.
不过，以下几个因素和猜测，可以为我们提供诸多启发。
However, the following factors and speculation can provide us with a lot of inspiration.
1 隔离防疫的成果从传染病的角度来说，传染具有三要素：传染源、传播途径、易感人群。
Results of Isolated Immunization From the point of view of infectious diseases, transmission has three elements: source of infection, route of transmission, and susceptible population.
在尚无疫苗保护易感人群的情况下，只有对作为传染源的SARS患者进行严格隔离、切断传播途径（例如，穿戴外科口罩或 N95 口罩、手套、防护服，洗手等），方可控制病毒的扩散。
In the absence of a vaccine to protect vulnerable populations, the spread of the virus can only be controlled by severely isolating and cutting off transmission routes (e.g. wearing surgical masks or N95 masks, gloves, protective clothing, hand washing, etc.).
在 2003 年 3 月 WHO 发布全球警报前，新加坡的第一例 SARS 病例就已经住院治疗了。
The first SARS case in Singapore had been hospitalized before the World Health Organization issued a global alert in March 2003.
因为没有接到预警，患者入住了没有隔离措施的普通病房，院内感染了 20 余名接触者。
In the absence of an early warning, the patient was admitted to a general ward without isolation, and the hospital infected more than 20 contacts.
而在医院采取了严格的感染控制后，再也没有院内 SARS 的传播。
After the hospital adopted strict infection control, there was no further spread of SARS in the hospital.
隔离防疫对于这次的疫情同样很重要 | Pixabay值得注意的是，一旦医院的感染控制放松，SARS 即可再发，加拿大 SARS 疫情的二次暴发就与此有关。
Isolation was also important at the time of the outbreak. Pixabay is notable for the re-emergence of SARS once hospital infection control was relaxed, as was the case with the secondary outbreak of SARS in Canada.
2003 年 3 月，接诊 SARS 患者的一家医院，由于感染控制不到位、没有排查出所有的 SARS 患者并隔离，导致了同医院的一名骨折患者感染了 SARS 病毒。
In March 2003, a hospital that treated SARS patients contracted the SARS virus because infection control was not in place and all SARS patients were not identified and quarantined.
随后，这名不知情的患者转院，于 5 月引发了另一家医院的聚集感染［6］。
Subsequently, the uninformed patient was transferred to hospital, triggering a conglomerate infection in another hospital in May [6].
严格且持续的感染控制，特别是在医院等易感人群密集的场所的隔离防护，对控制 SARS 至关重要。
Strict and sustained infection control, especially in high-risk locations such as hospitals, is essential to control SARS.
2 病毒自身有弱点SARS 感染的早期，病毒的传播能力较弱；在出现症状后 6～11 天，呼吸系统症状严重时，患者呼吸道分泌物中的 SARS 病毒量也达到峰值［7］，病毒的传染能力强。
The virus has its own weaknesses in the early stages of SARS infection, the ability to spread the virus is weak; the respiratory secretions of patients with severe respiratory symptoms peak the amount of SARS virus in their respiratory secretions [7] 6-11 days after symptoms develop, and the virus is highly contagious.
这也是为何医护人员（尤其是进行气管插管的耳鼻喉及麻醉科大夫）在 SARS 中更容易中招。
This is why it is easier for health care workers (especially otolaryngologists and anesthesiologists who perform trachea intubation) to recruit on SARS.
但同时，SARS 病毒这种在感染早期传染力较低、在病情加重时传染力较高的特点，有利于医疗人员尽早识别患者，在传染性增强之前就采取防范措施，从而防控 SARS 病毒的传染。
At the same time, however, the SARS virus, which is characterized by low transmission at an early stage of infection and high transmission when the disease worsens, facilitates the early identification of patients by medical personnel and prevents transmission of the SARS virus by taking precautions before infection increases.
如果 SARS 冠状病毒变得更为狡猾，在早期传染力就比较高，这种情况下，早期患者很可能因为症状不典型从而难以被辨别出来，病毒就会悄无声息地迅速传染给易感人群。
If the SARS coronavirus had become more cunning, it would have been more infectious at an early stage. In this case, the early sufferer would have been uncharacterised and the virus would have passed on to the susceptible population.
电镜下的冠状病毒 |Dr. Fred Murphy / CDC另外，SARS 病毒传染二代病例之后，再传 3～4 代的情况比较少，这可能是因为病毒的致病力会随着代际的传播而逐渐降低。
Dr Fred Murphy / CDC. Also, transmission of the SARS virus from generation 2 to generation was less common in three to four generations after transmission, probably because the virus's pathogenicity decreased over the generations.
否则，以 SARS 病毒 9.6% 的病死率，在全世界大流行后，可能会有无数家庭遭遇家破人亡的惨剧。
Otherwise, at a mortality rate of 9.6 per cent for the SARS virus, countless families could be killed in the wake of a worldwide pandemic.
3 季节性冠状病毒冠状病毒几乎无所不在，但是能感染人类、乃至引发突发公共卫生事件的，只是其中的很少一部分。
Seasonal coronavirus coronavirus is almost ubiquitous, but it can infect humans and even cause public health emergencies, but only a small proportion of them.
在温带，冠状病毒引起的呼吸系统感染主要发生在冬季（当然，秋季或者春季也有发病的小高峰），这看起来像是特定气候作用下的结果。
In the temperate zone, the respiratory infection caused by coronavirus mainly occurs in winter (although there are also minor peaks in autumn or spring), which seems to be the result of specific climatic effects.
但实际上，冠状病毒的感染在任何季节都可能发生。
But in fact, the coronavirus infection can occur in any season.
只是到了冬季，大家都聚集在屋里取暖，加上各种节日的人员流动，更有利于病毒的传播。
It is only in the winter, when people gather inside to warm up, and a variety of holiday movements, more conducive to the spread of the virus.
每到冬季，医院的呼吸科及各个科室的呼吸道感染的患者，都处于全年的高位水平。
Every winter, the respiratory department of the hospital and all departments of the respiratory infection patients, are at a high level throughout the year.
因而，也有人猜测，SARS 冠状病毒在夏季戛然而止，是因为天气变热了。
Therefore, there is also speculation that the SARS coronavirus in the summer came to an abrupt end, because the weather became hot.
不过，气温的逐渐升高、患病人数的逐渐下降，这两者是否为因果关系尚不得知；我们还需要更多的观察研究，来确定还有没有其他的干扰因素。
However, it is not known whether there is a causal relationship between the gradual increase in temperature and the gradual decline in the number of cases; more observational studies are needed to determine whether there are other disturbances.
位于深圳市中心公园的非典纪念碑 |Sparktour / Wikimedia Commons病毒比人类的存在更为古老，我们不知道它因何而来，也不知道它为何而去。
Sparks / Wikimedia Commons, a SARS monument in Shenzhen Central Park, is older than human beings, and we don't know why or why it came.
人类在一场场病毒和生活的赌博中，能够赢得的全部东西，就是知识和记忆。
All that man can win in a field of viruses and the gamble of life is knowledge and memory.
尽管 SARS 病毒和这次的新冠病毒有所不同，但尽早发现疫情、严格隔离控制、研究病毒特点、追踪病原起始，这些来自17年前的经验，也是这个冬天的宝贵财富。
Although the SARS virus is different from this one, early detection, strict isolation, research into virus characteristics, and tracking of the onset of the disease are lessons from 17 years of experience and a valuable asset this winter.
希望没有一个冬天是不可逾越的，没有一个盛夏是不会到来的。
I hope no winter is insurmountable and no summer is impossible.

新冠病患会否“复发”？极少数出院者核酸检测疑为假阴性这些患者再次发病的时间、病程和就诊难度各异，但他们至今不清楚，自己是“复发”还是没有被治愈？他们曾被计入治愈出院的统计病例中，而突发的症状和重新检测结果意味着，他们实际上没有被彻底治愈。
Do newly released patients "relapse"? Very few patients with suspected false-negative nucleic acid testing have different timing, course, and difficulty in finding out whether they have relapsed or have not been cured? They have been counted in the number of cured cases, and the sudden symptoms and re-examination results mean that they have not actually been completely cured.
