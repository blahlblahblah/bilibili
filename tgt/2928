本报记者 陈佳岚 陈溢波 李正豪 北京 广州报道每年春节过后，都是刘伟（化名）最繁忙的时候。
Our reporter Chen Jiaolan Chen Yilan Li Zhenghao Beijing Guangzhou reports that after the Spring Festival each year, Liu Wei (alias) is the busiest time.
3月4日下午，熟悉富士康劳务供应的刘伟告诉《中国经营报》记者，“郑州富士康目前在厂员工大约7万人，每天大约招募5000人。
On the afternoon of March 4, Liu Wei, familiar with Foxconn's labor supply, told China Business Daily: "Zhengzhou Foxconn currently employs about 70,000 people and recruits about 5,000 people a day.
”十天之前的2月24日，记者核实得知，共有46个餐厅的郑州富士康，当日24个餐厅开业，午餐时间共产生16423人次的刷卡记录，另有先行隔离区6734人次的送餐记录。
Ten days ago, the reporter verified that Foxconn, a 46-restaurant facility, opened 24 restaurants on the same day, generating 16,423 credit cards at lunchtime and 6,734 meals served in the ZOS.
而因特殊时期餐厅流程烦琐，也有大量员工选择自行解决午餐。
Due to the cumbersome restaurant process in special times, a large number of employees choose to solve their own lunch.
不过，据刘伟介绍，郑州富士康“大约还差10万人”，因为正常情况下郑州富士康在厂员工应该在15万人左右，高峰期曾达到40万人。
However, according to Liu, Foxconn in Zhengzhou "still needs about 100,000 people" because Foxconn in Zhengzhou would normally have about 150,000 employees at the plant, peaking at 400,000.
郑州富士康是iPhone最大的代工厂。
Zhengzhou Foxconn is the iPhone's largest subcontractor.
苹果公司CEO蒂姆.库克2月中旬在美国对媒体透露，富士康计划在2月底之前恢复其在中国大陆50%的生产，3月恢复其在中国大陆80%的生产。
Apple CEO Tim Cook told reporters in the United States in mid-February that Foxconn plans to resume 50% of production in mainland China by the end of February and 80% in mainland China in March.
但刘伟认为，截至3月4日，郑州富士康达到50%的复工率不大可能。
But as of March 4, it is unlikely that Foxconn in Zhengzhou will resume work at 50%, Liu said.
另外，根据苹果公司2019年核心供应商名单，苹果全球供应商主要集中在中国大陆、中国台湾、美国、日本、欧洲、韩国等，除中国之外的其他国家和地区正处于疫情暴发期，苹果全球供应链是否存在危机备受业界关注。
In addition, according to the core supplier list of Apple 2019, Apple's global suppliers are mainly concentrated in mainland China, Taiwan, the United States, Japan, Europe, South Korea and other countries and regions except China.
组装厂复工复产公开数据显示，苹果公司的产品中有90%以上的产能来自中国大陆。
Open data from assembly plants showing that more than 90% of Apple's production capacity comes from mainland China.
其中，iPhone的代工生产很大一部分在富士康与和硕。
Much of the iPhone's contract production is in Foxconn and Asus.
和硕是指和硕联合科技股份有限公司，该公司旗下位于上海浦东的昌硕科技是仅次于富士康的iPhone代工厂。
Asus is Hesuo United Technologies, a Shanghai-based Asustek technology company that is second only to Foxconn's iPhone.
富士康的iPhone产能则主要集中在郑州（占90%）和深圳。
Foxconn's iPhone capacity is concentrated in Zhengzhou (90%) and Shenzhen.
也就是说，iPhone今年在全球的供应链，首先就要看富士康与和硕了，尤其是郑州富士康和昌硕（上海）的表现了。
In other words, the iPhone's global supply chain this year starts with Foxconn and Asus, particularly in Zhengzhou's Foxconn and Changshu (Shanghai).
“富士康iDPBG郑州普工招募”官方认证公号2月21日的推送显示，iDPBG（integrated Digital Product Business Group，数位产品事业群）2~14级的在职员工，若2月29日前已上岗、或2月29日前虽为上岗但正在返岗、且在3月18日之前上岗的员工，在职满60天奖励3250元，在职满90天再奖2000元。
"Foxconn iDPBG Zhengzhou general labor recruitment" The official February 21 push shows that iDPBG (integrated Digital Product Business Group) 2-14 active employees who have taken up their duties before February 29 or are on duty before February 29 but are returning to work before March 18 will be rewarded with $3,250 after 60 days of service and $2,000 after 90 days of service.
记者了解得知，郑州富士康一线员工的工资水准在六七千元，也就是说，只要在2月底或3月中上岗的员工，都可以获得相当于1/2~2/3月工资的奖励。
The reporter learned that the salary level of the front-line employees in Zhengzhou Foxconn is 6,000 yuan, that is, as long as the end of February or mid-March staff members can be the equivalent of 1 / 2 to 2 / 3 of the monthly salary.
郑州富士康一方面鼓励老员工早日返岗，另一方面则委托劳务公司四处“拉人”。
Zhengzhou Foxconn on the one hand encourages the old employees to return to work as soon as possible, on the other hand entrusts the labor company everywhere.
记者了解到，2月中下旬，郑州富士康不断加码对劳务派遣公司为其“拉人”的鼓励政策，到2月底已变为：招募来的员工打卡满35天、且在职满60天发放3300元返费；在此基础上若在职满90天，则再发放3700元。
The reporter understands that in the second half of February, Foxconn in Zhengzhou constantly increased its "pull" policy for labor dispatch companies. By the end of February, it had changed to: 35 days of recruitment and a return of 3,300 yuan after 60 days of service; on that basis, another 3,700 yuan would be paid.
这相当于劳务派遣公司每为郑州富士康招募一个在职满90天的员工，其员工就可获得7000元（相当于富士康员工一月工资）的奖励。
That is equivalent to a bonus of 7,000 yuan (one month's pay for Foxconn employees) for each employee recruited by the labor dispatch company to complete 90 days of service.
即便如此，据刘伟介绍，由于新冠疫情影响，在2月10日开始复工时，郑州富士康开工初期“每天只能进几百人，（苹果公司CEO）库克讲（2月底50%、3月80%）的时候每天能进1000人左右，现在每天能进5000人，目前厂区有五六万人，但平时在厂员工数10万~15万人属于正常水平。
Even so, according to Liu, Foxconn was able to get in only a few hundred people a day at the start of the start of the new crown epidemic on Feb. 10. "Cook (Apple CEO) says about 1,000 people a day (50% at the end of February and 80% in March).
”因此，当前郑州富士康员工缺口压力依然很大。
As a result, the current shortage of employees in Zhengzhou Foxconn is still under pressure.
另据了解，每年和硕和富士康在招募员工上必有一战，今年也不例外。
It is also understood that every year Asus and Foxconn in the recruitment of staff must be a battle, this year is no exception.
记者获悉，由于和硕旗下昌硕工厂位于上海，与毗邻湖北的河南相比，上海防疫压力小一些，因此昌硕复岗情况要好一些。
Reporters learned that because Asus's Asustek plant is located in Shanghai, compared with the neighboring Hubei Henan, Shanghai less epidemic prevention pressure, the situation is better.
同时，由于急于开工，其实正是昌硕打响了高返费“抢人”的第一枪——昌硕招募一个新员工（在职满90天），劳务公司员工能获得奖励高达10000元。
Meanwhile, eager to get started, Asustek actually fired the first round of high-return charges - hiring a new employee (after 90 days in office) and rewarding the company's employees up to $10,000.
据记者多方调查了解，总体而言，尽管iPhone代工厂用工缺口依然很大，但鉴于目前防疫情况及员工招募情况，多名业内人士预计iPhone代工厂3月份复工80%是有可能达到的。
Overall, industry insiders expect the iPhone factory to be back to work by 80% in March, despite a huge shortfall in iPhone contract workers, according to multiple reporters.
富士康母公司近日公开表示，依照目前进度，3月底前应该能恢复季节性正常产能。
Foxconn's parent company said recently that at current rates it should be able to restore normal seasonal capacity by the end of March.
3月6日，刘伟告诉记者，目前富士康和昌硕招募第一阶段基本完成，招聘压力有所缓解，开始限制年龄。
March 6, Liu Wei told reporters that at present Foxconn and Asustek recruitment phase basically completed, recruitment pressure has eased, began to limit the age.
苹果公司也试图将组装业务转移到海外。
Apple is also trying to move its assembly business overseas.
《华尔街日报》3月3日发表苹果中国供应链报告，披露早在2015年苹果公司运营主管就建议应该“将至少一种产品的组装转移到越南”，这样可以让苹果在中国以外的地方开展“工人培训并建立新的零部件供应商体系”，但当时遭到苹果高层拒绝。
In the Wall Street Journal's March 3 report on China's supply chain, Apple's chief operating officer suggested as early as 2015 that 'assembly of at least one product should be moved to Vietnam,' which would allow Apple to 'train workers and build a new supplier system for parts outside China,' but Apple executives declined.
去年年中，外媒又披露称，苹果已要求主要的供货商进行评估，如果将15%-30%的产能分散到海外，将会面临哪些状况？《华尔街日报》发表的供应链报告指出，苹果对中国供应链的依赖在未来很长一段时间都难以改变。
In the middle of last year, foreign media revealed that Apple had asked its major suppliers to assess what would happen if 15% to 30% of production capacity were spread overseas, a Wall Street Journal supply chain report said Apple's reliance on China's supply chains would be difficult to change for a long time to come.
供应链存隐忧在富士康及和硕复工复产压力大的同时，而负责“喂料”的苹果全球供应链，形势也不容乐观。
While Foxconn and Asus are under pressure to get back to work, Apple's global supply chain, which is responsible for feeding, is not promising.
与中国供应商相比，当前更令人担心的可能是欧洲及日韩的苹果供应商。
More worrisome today than Chinese suppliers are likely to be Apple suppliers in Europe and Japan and South Korea.
据韩国媒体报道，三星电子位于韩国东南部城市龟尾（Gumi）的工厂自2月21日开始出现第一例新冠确诊病例，至3月2日已出现4例，导致该工厂生产线已数次停运。
Samsung's plant in the southeastern South Korean city of Gumi has seen its first confirmed new case since February 21 and four cases by March 2, leading to several shutdowns of the plant's production line, South Korean media reported.
另外，LG旗下主业为显示屏的LG Display，以及主要提供摄像头的LG Innotek也受到疫情影响而停工。
In addition, LG Display, the LG's main display screen, and LG Innotek, the main camera provider, were also shut down by the outbreak.
三星和LG在中国大陆的供应商高层告诉记者，韩国当前的防疫措施是工厂出现病例就要停工停产，全面进行消毒杀毒，两三天之后就又复工复产了。
Samsung and LG suppliers in mainland China told reporters that the current anti-epidemic measures in South Korea is to stop the production of factory cases, complete disinfection and anti-virus, two or three days after the resumption of work.
问题在于，像三星电子龟尾工厂，每隔几天就出现一个病例，需要不断停工停产，影响还是很大。
The problem is that, like Samsung's Turtle-tail factory, a case occurs every few days, requiring constant shut-downs that still have a big impact.
根据苹果2019年200家核心供应商名单，其供应商在中国大陆41家，在中国台湾46家，美国38家、日本38家、欧洲18家、韩国11家。
Apple has 41 suppliers in mainland China, 46 in Taiwan, 38 in the US, 38 in Japan, 18 in Europe and 11 in South Korea, according to a list of 200 core suppliers in 2019.
这些国家和地区基本上都出现了疫情。
Virtually all of these countries and regions have experienced outbreaks.
比如，在韩国，三星系的三星电子和三星SDI以及LG系的LG Display和乐金化学都是苹果核心供应商。
In South Korea, for example, Samsung Electronics and Samsung SDI in three galaxies, and LG Display and LG Chemistry are core Apple suppliers.
另外，总部位于欧洲疫情重灾区意大利的意法半导体（ST Microelectronics），也是苹果供应链上让人担心的公司之一。
In addition, ST Microelectronics, headquartered in Italy, the epicentre of the European epidemic, is one of the concerns in Apple's supply chain.
山东的苹果核心供应商高管3月4日告诉记者，该公司与苹果业务相关的工厂主要在山东和海外，其中山东本部5万人，海外工厂1万人。
Shandong's core supplier told reporters March 4 that the company's factories related to Apple's business are mainly in Shandong and overseas, with 50,000 people in Shandong province and 10,000 overseas factories.
目前，山东工厂到岗的主要是本省籍员工，外省员工大部分还未能返岗，总体员工返岗率不足70%。
At present, Shandong factories are mainly to the provincial staff, the majority of workers in the provinces have not returned to work, the overall return rate of less than 70%.
海外工厂的中国籍员工到公司后也需要隔离14天才能到岗。
Chinese workers from overseas factories also need to be quarantined for up to 14 days after arrival at the company.
该高管认为，当前苹果供应链最大的挑战还是在组装厂没有完全开动起来，作为零配件供应商，随时能看到来自组装厂的订单数据不断波动，但截至目前未出现所谓“砍单”行为，供应链依然在按计划运转。
The biggest challenge for Apple's current supply chain, the executives say, is not yet fully operational at assembly plants, where parts suppliers can readily see fluctuating order data from assembly plants, but so far there has been no so-called "chopping," and the supply chain is still running as planned.
刘伟告诉记者，苹果上游供应商企业也是极其缺人，据他了解，像可成、可胜企业，一家人力供应商一天就送几十个人。
Mr. Liu told reporters that Apple upstream suppliers are also desperately short of people, and he understands that a manpower supplier can deliver dozens of people a day, like a viable and successful company.
“他总共是一个厂区十几个人力供应商，平均每一家他送几十个人，太少了。
"He's a dozen or so manpower suppliers in a factory, and on average he delivers dozens of people per family. Too few.
”劳务行业独立观察员、劳务茶馆创始人李城伟告诉记者，相较于往年过了正月十五就基本没人的状况，今年节后劳务是个持久战，预计企业会持续到大约3月底、4月初才完成招募。
Li Chengwei, an independent labor observer and founder of the service teahouse, told reporters that the post-holiday labour market is a protracted one compared with the previous year, when recruitment was expected to continue until about the end of March and the beginning of April.
国内另外一家苹果核心供应商蓝思科技知情人士则告诉记者，该公司订单饱和，因此人力资源需求与往年相比翻了一倍——大概需要十来万人，但目前到岗员工已可满足现有产能需求，面向新园区新产能需求的员工招聘工作正在加紧进行。
Lance Technology, another Chinese core supplier, told reporters the company was saturated with orders, so its human-resource needs had doubled compared with previous years -- about 100,000 people -- but the current workforce could meet existing capacity needs, and recruitment for new capacity in the new campus was intensifying.
蓝思科技主要为iPhone提供玻璃后盖。
Rance Technology mainly provides a glass back cover for the iPhone.
刘伟透露，春节之后，蓝思科技并不是出价高的招聘方，但蓝思科技招人很迫切，最近地方政府为了给湖南长沙的蓝思科技工厂“拉人”，都跑到了村里面。
After the Spring Festival, Lance isn't the highest bidder, says Mr. Liu. But the company is desperate to be hired, and recently the local government rushed to the village to pull people for the Blue Si technology factory in Changsha, Hunan.
蓝思科技方面证实，地方政府帮忙进村招人确有其事。
Lanth Technology confirmed that it was true that the local government was helping to recruit people into the village.
当前新冠疫情正在全球蔓延，苹果全球供应链的某些关键环节会不会出现危机？前述山东供应商高管分析，在苹果供应链中，每一个环节都有两到三家供应商，其中前两大供应商的份额会达到80%~90%，第三大供应商的份额一般在10%以下，如果某个环节的一家供应商出现问题，另外一到两家供应商应该会顶上去；即使某个环节的供应商都出现问题，也会有“安全库存”帮忙缓冲，短期内不会出现大问题。
According to the previous Shandong Supplier Analysis, there are two or three suppliers in each chain, the top two suppliers will reach 80% to 90%, the third largest supplier will be below 10%, and one or two suppliers will be able to help buffer against problems in one segment, and no major problems in the short term.
Gartner研究总监吕俊宽也对记者表示，全球疫情对苹果供应链的影响“是可以Cover的，在现实中可以有很多控制的手法让（零部件）供应及（组装厂）生产恢复正常”。
Lu Junkuan, Gartner's director of research, also told reporters that the impact of the global epidemic on Apple's supply chain was "manageable, with a lot of controls in place to get [parts] supply and [assembly plant] production back to normal."
吕俊宽也提到，苹果供应链每一个环节“都还是有一些库存”，再加上供应链的复工和后续的加紧赶工，进度应该可以追上去。
Mr. Lu also noted that every link in Apple's supply chain 'still has some inventory,' which, together with the resumption of supply chain work and subsequent acceleration, should catch up.
需求面变化更重要当前新冠疫情在全球对苹果供应链的影响显然是存在的。
Demand-side changes are more important The global impact of the current crowning epidemic on Apple's supply chain is clear.
关于这一点，库克在2月27日的股东大会上也坦承当前面临“挑战”。
On this point, Cook admitted at the Feb. 27 shareholder meeting that he now faces "challenges."
但是从调研来看，业界普遍认为，“世界工厂”中国正在加快从疫情中恢复生产，从全年来看这种影响是可控的。
But research suggests that the industry generally agrees that China, the "world's factory," is accelerating its recovery from the epidemic, and that the impact is manageable throughout the year.
比如，吕俊宽在采访中表示，现有型号iPhone的生产和供应“我觉得还好”，“但是新品比如本来要上市的新iPhone S1现在没有发布，也不能确定何时上市，所以对新品是有影响的。
For example, Mr. Lu said in an interview that 'I feel fine' with the existing iPhone production and supply, 'but new products such as the new iPhone S1, which would otherwise be on the market, aren't being released and aren't sure when they will go on sale, so they have an impact on new iPhones.
”另一方面，吕俊宽还表示，“（每年）9月新品上市不见得有影响，但供应量可能受影响，可能会缺货。
On the other hand, Mr Lu said: "The launch in September [of each year] is not likely to have an impact, but supply may be affected and supplies may be out of stock."
”前述山东供应商高管认为，对智能手机行业来说，好消息每年春节过后本来就是淡季，下半年通常会是旺季，从这种角度来看全年的影响可能不会太大。
The good news for the smartphone industry, according to Shandong supplier executives, is that the year-round impact is likely to be modest from the perspective of the low-season after the annual Spring Festival and the usually busy second half of the year.
安惠投资基金经理李智佳也认为，新冠疫情“肯定有影响，但目前来看影响不是致命的。
Li Zhijia, manager of Anhui Investment Fund, agreed that the outbreak "certainly made a difference, but the impact is not fatal so far."
因为现有的机型有备货，而且没有新产品。
Because the existing models are available in stock and there are no new products.
如果疫情暴发在9月份或者11月份，那对苹果的影响将非常大”。
If the outbreak occurs in September or November, the impact on Apple could be significant.
吕俊宽还提醒，相对于零部件供应和组装厂生产问题而言，可能新冠疫情对智能手机的全球消费需求反而是更需要关注的。
Lu also warned that the new crown epidemic may be more of a concern for global smartphone consumption than parts supply and assembly plant production.
“我觉得供应链的问题都是小问题，疫情对全球经济的影响才是大问题。
"I think the supply chain problems are minor and the impact of the epidemic on the global economy is the big issue.
供应链问题只会让苹果的短期获利能力受到一点影响，全球经济若受到影响就不是一点影响的问题了。
Supply-chain problems will affect Apple's short-term profitability only a little, and the impact on the global economy will not matter a bit.
”吕俊宽表示，“现在看起来，像意大利、伊朗等国家的疫情如果持续下去，（疫情）对需求端的影响就不再只有中国市场了，而是全球的影响了。
"It now seems that if the epidemic continues in countries like Italy and Iran, the impact on the demand side will no longer be on the Chinese market alone, but on the global level," he said.
另外，美国疫情也在迅速升高，在需求端对消费者的购买也会造成影响。
In addition, the United States epidemic is also rising rapidly, the demand side of consumer purchases will also have an impact.
”国内一家券商的电子行业分析师也对记者表示，“只要在需求没有消失的情况下，（苹果供应链）是可以通过后续的赶工来实现一定程度的追赶。
Electronic industry analysts at one of the country's brokerages also told reporters: "As long as demand does not disappear, there is a degree of catch-up that can be achieved through follow-on work."
”该分析师还表示，从中国市场来看，今年第一季度智能手机在需求端的下调幅度不会太小，而“如果中国疫情在4月底得到控制，可能第二季度的情况就会改善很多”。
The analyst also said that the demand-side cut in smartphones in the first quarter of this year would not be too large in the Chinese market and that "if the epidemic in China were contained by the end of April, it would probably improve considerably in the second quarter."
从全球范围来看，当前业界预期不一，“有人认为10%的调整幅度已经很大了，有人则认为15%都可能是小幅度调整”。
Globally, current industry expectations are mixed, with "some arguing that a 10 per cent adjustment is already significant and others arguing that 15 per cent could be a small adjustment."
除此以外，疫情对于包括美国股市在内的全球资本市场影响正在逐步深化。
In addition, the epidemic's impact on global capital markets, including the US stock market, is deepening.
数据显示，自2月20日以来，苹果股价已经从323.62美元/股波动下行至3月5日收盘时的292.92美元/股，下跌近10%；苹果市值从2月19日的1.4万亿美元下跌至3月5日的1.2万亿美元，跌去0.2万亿美元。
Since Feb. 20, Apple shares have tumbled nearly 10%, from $323.62 a share price to $292.92 a share at the close of March 5, down nearly $0.2 trillion from $1.4 trillion on February 19 to $1.2 trillion on March 5.
对此，章和投资管理合伙人、美国哥伦比亚大学高级访问学者高国垒表示，对于苹果公司股价下跌的问题，“首先要看到美股连续下跌在当前是普遍性的，不是苹果公司一家的问题。
In response, Gao Guobai, a senior visiting scholar at Columbia University and managing partner for Chapter and Investment, said the first thing to see about the fall in Apple's share price was that "the first thing to see is that the successive falls in U.S. stocks are now widespread, not Apple's."
同时，今年又是美国的大选年，历史上基本上每次大选年来临美国股市都会出现比较大的波动，这是因为新一任总统上台之后往往与前任总统在风格上会有比较大的区别。
At the same time, this is another election year in the United States, where the stock market has fluctuated quite a bit at the beginning of almost every election year, because when a new president takes office, he or she tends to be somewhat different in style from his predecessor.
”就苹果公司的基本面而言，高国垒认为，对苹果后市表现能产生影响的因素主要包括：一是全球疫情的不确定性，及其对苹果产品供应面和需求面的影响；二是苹果服务收入的增长速度和营收占比正在持续上升，如果这部分能延续良好表现，对苹果是利好的；三是苹果硬件收入增速最近两年确实放缓了，但用户总量毕竟还是上升的，如果用量总量滞胀则对苹果后市表现不利。
In terms of Apple's fundamentals, Gauguo thinks the main factors behind Apple's performance include uncertainty about the global epidemic and its impact on both the supply and demand sides of Apple's products. Second, revenue from Apple services is growing faster and better for Apple if it continues to perform well.
