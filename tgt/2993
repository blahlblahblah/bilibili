世卫组织一位专家认为，“恐慌”（panic）的意思包含在“大流行”（pandemic）里，新冠疫情可能变成“大流行”当然是个隐忧，因为这比流感致死率更高，“但是我们希望能延迟宣告越久越好，直到我们有了疫苗，这大概还需要12-18个月。
According to a WHO expert, "panic" means "pandemic," and the possibility of a new crown outbreak becoming a "pandemic" is certainly a concern, because it is higher than the death rate from influenza, "but we want to delay the announcement as long as possible until we have the vaccine, which will probably take another 12-18 months."

Photo / AFP / F & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & nbsp; & # 45
但这一判断还不是世界卫生组织（WHO，以下简称“世卫组织”）的官方说法，世卫组织何时会宣布，目前存在争议与压力。
But that judgment is not the official World Health Organization (WHO) statement when it will announce that there is controversy and pressure.
史巴恩进一步表示，他对疫情做出这样的宣示，是希望民众得到三个重要信息：1、控制疫情比经济利益更重要；2、没有人知道疫情什么时候达到高峰，但是做出预警让大家有所准备很重要；3、在疫情下保持冷静，即使在压力下也要信任彼此。
He further said he wanted people to get three important messages: 1) Controlling the epidemic is more important than economic gain; 2) Nobody knows when the epidemic will peak, but it's important to prepare for it; 3) Remain calm in an epidemic and trust each other even under stress.
根据世卫组织统计，至日内瓦时间3月6日下午为止，德国感染案例达534例，单日新增272例。
According to WHO statistics, as of the afternoon of 6 March Geneva time, there were 534 cases of infection in Germany and 272 new cases per day.
重灾区在北莱茵-威斯特法伦州，疫情起自一对被感染夫妇参加了狂欢节活动。
The worst-hit area is North Rhine-Westphalia, where the outbreak began with an infected couple attending a carnival.
史巴恩对全球疫情进入“大流行”的说法，明显与世卫组织再三避免使用“大流行”一词的谨慎态度形成对比，也将新冠病毒在全球是否构成“大流行”的争论再往上推一级。
Mr Spahn's talk of a global pandemic stands in stark contrast to the WHO's cautious approach of repeatedly avoiding the word "pandemic" and has pushed the debate on whether the new cap virus constitutes a "pandemic" around the world one step higher.
世界卫生组织在2月28日首度将“全球风险”和“区域风险”同时从“高”调到“非常高”，当日全球新增5个国家发现案例，包括荷兰、白俄罗斯、立陶宛、新西兰和尼日利亚，全球除中国以外的感染国达51个。
The World Health Organization (WHO) first moved "global risk" and "regional risk" simultaneously from "high" to "very high" on February 28, when five new countries were found worldwide, including the Netherlands, Belarus, Lithuania, New Zealand and Nigeria, with 51 countries worldwide excluding China.
自此全球疫情一路升温，至3月6日，全球感染达98192例，分散在89个国家或地区，其中中国报告80711例、韩国6284例、意大利3858例、伊朗3513例，德国、法国、西班牙、英国的新增病例都在快速增长，美国则刚刚开始在全国的大规模检测计划。
Since then, the global epidemic has risen to 98,192 cases worldwide, spread over 89 countries or areas, including 80,711 in China, 6,284 in South Korea, 3,858 in Italy and 3,513 in Iran. New cases are growing rapidly in Germany, France, Spain and the United Kingdom.
截至北京时间3月7日9时，全球累计感染已超过10万例。
By 0900 hours Beijing time on March 7, the cumulative number of global infections had exceeded 100,000.
究竟世卫组织是否有必要宣告“大流行”，公共卫生专家和世卫组织对“大流行”的定义、宣告后的影响持不同的看法，因而造成僵持不下的现状。
Whether it is necessary for WHO to declare a "pandemic," public-health experts and WHO hold different views on the definition, post-declaration impact of a "pandemic," thus creating a stalemate.
不少公共卫生专家认为当前情况已算是“大流行”。
Many public health experts consider the current situation to be a pandemic.
伦敦帝国学院流行病学专家弗格森（ Neil Ferguson ）对媒体指出，“我认为叫它‘大流行’是合理的”。
"I think it makes sense to call it a pandemic," Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London, told the media.
美国内布拉斯加大学医学专家劳勒（James Lawler）甚至指出，“大流行”是指病毒在全球出现传染，“我们现在已经进入大流行，目前未宣告是因为政治原因。
James Lawler, a medical expert at the University of Nebraska in the United States, went so far as to point out that "pandemic" refers to the global spread of the virus.
”世卫组织总干事谭德塞3月2日记者会上表示，“这个病毒具备形成大流行的潜力吗？当然是。
"Does the virus have the potential to form a pandemic?" WHO Director-General Theresa Tupper told a news conference on March 2.
我们已经面临这（大流行）情况吗？基于我们的评估，还没有。
Are we already facing this (pandemic) situation? Based on our assessment, not yet.
“ 我们并未看到无法控制的全球传播，而且我们也尚未看到大规模的严重症状或死亡。
"We have not seen uncontrollable global transmission, and we have not seen serious symptoms or deaths on a large scale."
WHO发言人贾萨瑞维奇则对媒体解释，世卫组织已经不再使用把“大流行”列为最高等级的六阶段流行病警示系统，“大流行”一词在未来或将以“非正式”的形式被使用。
WHO spokesman Dmitry Jasarevic explained to the media that the WHO no longer uses the six-stage pandemic alert system, which puts "pandemic" at the top, and that the word "pandemic" may be used "informally" in the future.
贾萨瑞维奇进一步对《财经》记者强调，世卫组织已经在1月30日宣告全球疫情达到“国际突发公共卫生事件”，这是疫情警示的最高层级，自此“我们看到多个国家出现案例……这些案例大部分是可以溯源的，这意味着广泛的社区传播并不明显。
Jasarevic further told Caijing that the WHO had declared the global epidemic on January 30 to be an "international public health emergency," the highest level of alert to the epidemic, and since then "we have seen cases in many countries... mostly traceable, meaning that widespread community transmission is not evident."
有些国家甚至减缓或制止了传播。
Some countries have even slowed or halted transmission.
”世卫组织专家组组长布鲁斯·艾尔沃德（Bruce Aylward）率领考察组近日访问中国之后对媒体称，中国的抗疫方式可以被复制，但这需要速度、资金、想象力和政治勇气，迅速采取行动的国家仍有可能控制住疫情。
A team led by Bruce Aylward, the head of the WHO panel, told reporters after a recent visit to China that China's approach to fighting the disease could be replicated, but that it takes speed, money, imagination and political courage, and countries that act quickly can still contain the epidemic.
全球“大流行”的定义世卫组织原本将传染病的疫情分为六个阶段，分别为：第1阶段出现新型动物病毒；第2阶段新病毒感染人类；3阶段开始出现小型传播；第4阶段进入人传人；第5阶段在两个或更多区域出现社区感染；第6阶段社区传染进一步在更多区域中扩散，全球呈现“大流行”。
A Global Pandemic Definition WHO originally divided the epidemic into six phases: phase 1, when new animal viruses occur; phase 2, when new infections occur in humans; phase 3, when small-scale transmission begins; phase 4, when human-to-human transmission; phase 5, when community infections occur in two or more regions; and phase 6, when community-based transmission spreads further into more regions and presents a global "pandemic."
另外，世卫组织在其它网页将“大流行”定义为：“一个新型传染病毒在全球传播，大部分的人对此病毒不具抗体。
In addition, WHO defines "pandemic" on other Web pages as: "A new type of infectious disease virus spreads around the world and most people do not have antibodies to the virus.
此前，引发大流行的病毒多是源自动物传染病毒。
Previously, most of the viruses that caused the pandemic originated from zoonotic viruses.
”“这完全是个地理问题，” 约翰霍普金斯大学公共卫生专家索尔（Lauren Sauer）指出，“这和（病毒的）‘严重性’没关系，也不是案例的多少，而是我们是不是看到（病毒）出现跨地球传播。
"It's all a matter of geography," says Lauren Sauer, a public health specialist at Johns Hopkins University. "It's not about the severity, it's not the number of cases, it's whether we see [the virus] spreading across the globe.
”基于此标准，世卫组织在2009年将甲型H1N1流感病毒的传播列为大流行，却没想到H1N1的疫情最后并不像一开始预期的严重，不少专家、成员国和药企因为投入大量资源而批评世卫组织过于草率，不少专家认为，世卫组织从那以后避免使用“大流行”一词。
Based on this standard, WHO listed the spread of influenza A (H1N1) as a pandemic in 2009, but did not expect the H1N1 epidemic to end up as severe as initially expected, with experts, member States and pharmaceutical companies criticizing WHO for committing significant resources and many experts arguing that WHO has since avoided using the term "pandemic."
大部分专家认为“大流行”考虑的是感染的人和地点。
Most experts think a pandemic is about people and places to be infected.
如果感染病患在疫情发生国感染后回到自己国家，这种情形和受其传染的案例就不计算在“大流行”的统计案例内。
If an infected person returns to his or her home country after infection in the country where the outbreak occurred, the situation and cases of infection are not counted in the "pandemic" statistics.
H1N1当时的传播很大原因来自全球旅客的高频率流动，这和所谓“大流行”定义指出的多个区域出现“独立的社区感染”有所不同。
Much of the spread of H1N1 came from the high frequency of international travel, unlike the emergence of "independent community infections" in many areas identified in the so-called "pandemic" definition.
因此，公共卫生专家也在不断修正对“大流行”的案例计算标准。
As a result, public-health experts are constantly revising the criteria for calculating cases of a "pandemic."
针对新型冠状病毒，公共卫生专家专注于“地域型”传染的分析，也就是针对病毒在未到过中国或亚洲国家的人群中的传染。
For the new coronavirus, public health experts have focused on the analysis of "localised" infection, that is, the transmission of the virus among people who have not been to China or Asia.
上述内布拉斯加大学专家劳勒指出，以美国为例，美国多个人传人的案例都已经不再是输入感染，疫情在美国已经是国家内的传播，“我们看到其它具备先进生物控制体系的发达国家，也未能完全控制疫情的扩散。
In the United States, for example, many cases of human-to-human transmission in the United States are no longer imported, the epidemic is already spreading within the country, and "we see other advanced countries with advanced biological control systems that have not been able to fully control the spread of the epidemic."
”劳勒进一步指出，他预估美国30%-40%的民众都可能遭到感染。
Mr Lawler further notes that he estimates that 30 to 40 per cent of the US population is at risk of infection.
以此标准，部分专家认为这次疫情已经达到“大流行”标准，因为六个大陆已经出现独立且地方性传播。
By this yardstick, some experts believe the epidemic has reached the "pandemic" standard, as six continents have become independent and endemic.
不过，美国政府负责疫情的官员之一、国家过敏和传染病研究所主任弗契（Anthony Fauci）对“大流行”的看法则稍微保留，他认为全球“大流行”是时间问题，但还未完全到来。
But Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, one of the administration's officials in charge of the epidemic, has a slightly more reserved view of a "pandemic," which he says is a matter of time but has not yet fully arrived.
美国国防部则在3月初预估全球“大流行”将在30天内到来。
The US Department of Defense predicted in early March that a global "pandemic" would arrive within 30 days.
弗契指出，新型冠状病毒如果被认定进入“大流行”和季节性流感进入“大流行”是不一样的概念，全社会应该非常谨慎面对。
Fitch said the new coronavirus should be treated with great caution if it is considered a "pandemic" rather than a "pandemic" for seasonal influenza.
他解释称，因为科学家对季节性流感病毒的发病率、致死率和传播途径都很了解，也能相对精准预测，但是新冠病毒仍有非常多的未知参数，从致死率、潜伏期、传染力到无症状感染、检测标准等。
He explained that while scientists have a good understanding of the incidence, mortality and transmission pathways of seasonal influenza viruses and can predict them with relative precision, there are still very many unknown parameters for the new crown virus, ranging from mortality, incubation period, infectious power to asymptomatic infection and detection criteria.
约翰霍普金斯大学传染病专家阿达尔雅（Amesh Adalja）对《财经》记者指出，“无论有没有正式宣告，这（已经）是一个‘大流行’ 。
Amesh Adalja, an infectious diseases specialist at Johns Hopkins University, told Caijing that "with or without a formal announcement, this is a pandemic."
主要从病毒的类型和传播的方式，目前没有得到控制的迹象”，更重要的是接下来应该考虑重新分配资源，把原本用于隔离、限制旅游、机场监视的资源转到加强医院的准备。
There are no immediate signs of control, mainly from the type of virus and how it spreads. "More importantly, it should be followed by consideration of reallocating resources away from quarantine, travel restrictions, airport surveillance, and preparedness to strengthen hospitals.
导致恐慌或轻视世卫组织对“大流行”一词小心翼翼，其中一大原因是总干事谭德塞的谨慎态度。
One reason why the WHO is wary of the word "pandemic" is that it has led to panic or disdain for the cautious approach of Director-General Lindsay.
“不谨慎的使用‘大流行’这个词（对疫情）没有实际帮助，反而有带来不必要恐惧的风险，最后导致系统瘫痪，” 他指出。
"Careless use of the word 'pandemic' does not actually help, but carries the risk of unnecessary fear, which could eventually paralyze the system," he said.
“如果（使用该词）可能传达我们无法控制病毒的讯号，而这并非事实……如果能准确地反应现状，我们绝对不会犹豫使用‘大流行’这词。
"If [the word is used] may signal that we have no control over the virus, it is not true... if we can accurately reflect the status quo, we will never hesitate to use the word pandemic."
”谭德塞自己对“大流行”的标准是病毒对至少两个大洲造成重大影响。
Mr Tanner's own criterion for a pandemic is that the virus has had a significant impact on at least two continents.
以目前疫情，他认为目前使用这个词和事实并不相符，反而会引发恐慌。
Given the current epidemic, he believes that the current use of the word is not consistent with the facts, but will cause panic.
他强调，“现在不是聚焦在文字游戏的时候，这对防止今天的新感染或救一个生命没有帮助。
"This is not the time to focus on word games," he stressed. "It doesn't help to prevent new infections today or save a life.
”美国乔治城大学教授高斯汀（Lawrence Gostin）也是世卫组织国家和全球健康法律整合中心主任，他从字面意义上指出，英文字“恐慌”（panic）包含在“大流行”（pandemic）里，因此，需要考虑群众的情绪。
Lawrence Gostin, a professor at Georgetown University and director of the WHO Center for the Integration of National and Global Health Law, literally points out that the English word "panic" is included in "pandemic," so that the mood of the masses needs to be taken into account.
他进一步指出，新冠病毒可能变成“大流行”当然是个隐忧，因为这比流感致死率更高，“但是我们希望能延迟宣告越久越好，直到我们有了疫苗，这大概还需要12-18个月。
He further noted that the possibility of a new crown virus becoming "pandemic" was a concern, as it was higher than the death rate from influenza, "but we wanted to delay the announcement as long as possible until we had the vaccine, which would probably take another 12 to 18 months."
”尽管世卫组织对用词可能引发恐慌而谨慎使用“大流行”，不过也有批评者认为，目前世卫组织的用词谨慎，可能导致某些国家对疫情的轻视。
While the WHO has been cautious about using "pandemic" in terms that could cause panic, there are critics who argue that current WHO language is cautious and could lead some countries to downplay the epidemic.
近期，疫情在欧洲大陆和美国开始暴发，在部分医学专家看来，这与有关国家并没有及时采取有效防疫措施有关。
Recent outbreaks in continental Europe and the United States have been linked, in the view of some medical experts, to the failure of the countries concerned to take timely and effective preventive measures.
谭德塞在3月5日的记者会上指出，部分国家并未对抗疫付出全部的努力和政治承诺，“付出和我们面临的威胁不相符合。
Speaking at a news conference on March 5, Mr. Tan said some countries have not made all their efforts and political commitment to fight the epidemic, saying "the cost is not commensurate with the threat we face."
”他进一步在社交媒体上强调，全世界的领导都应该彻底执行抗疫计划，整合政府的每个部门，这不只是卫生部门，安全、外交、财政、商务、交通、贸易、信息等都应该投入。
He went on to stress on social media that leaders around the world should thoroughly implement the anti-epidemic plan, integrating every sector of government, not just the health sector, but also security, foreign affairs, finance, commerce, transport, trade, information, and so on.
“这不是演习，不是放弃的时候，不是找借口的时候，这是采取所有行动的时候，”谭德塞强调。
"This is not an exercise, not a time to give up, a time to make excuses, a time to take all actions," Mr Tanner stressed.
