戴口罩的意大利时尚博主Chiara Ferragni 图片来源：意大利时尚博主Chiara Ferragni Instagram主页记者：楼婍沁  编辑：许悦“ 从该博主所发相关推文的评论看，仍有不少外国民众认为新冠病毒与普通流感病毒无异，无需特殊防范。
Italian fashion blogger Chiara Ferragni Source: Italian fashion blogger Chiara Ferragni Instagram Home Page Journalist: Bentham House Editor: Lai Yue "Judging from comments in the blog's tweets, there are still many foreigners who believe that the new crown virus is no different from ordinary influenza viruses and does not require special precautions.
”新冠疫情正在全球范围内持续升级，包括意大利、韩国、伊朗等在内的多个国家、地区都连日出现确诊病例的大幅增长。
The new crown is escalating around the world, with many countries and regions, including Italy, South Korea and Iran, reporting large increases in confirmed cases every day.
与之对应的是，各界知名人士纷纷通过各种渠道发声，号召民众对此次的疫情以及病毒提高防范意识。
Correspondingly, celebrities from all walks of life have spoken out through various channels, calling on the public to raise awareness of the epidemic and the virus prevention.
在经历了多个品牌大秀取消、时装周头排VIP观众确诊感染病毒等一系列事件后，时尚界也终于有了一位重量级“意见领袖”出面发声。
After a series of brand cancellations, fashion week VIP audience confirmed infection with the virus, the fashion industry finally has a heavyweight "opinion leader" voice.
全球人气最高的时尚博主之一Chiara Ferragni率先通过图片社交应用Instagram发布了一张佩戴防护口罩的自拍，并言辞恳切地号召粉丝务必注意此次病毒的危险性，及防护的重要性：“这绝不是常见的流感，它对我们所有人来说都更危险：在这个关键的时刻，尽可能呆在家里。
Chiara Ferragni, one of the world's most popular fashion bloggers, pioneered a photo-social application, Instagram, and urged fans to pay attention to the dangers of the virus and the importance of protection: "It's not a common flu, it's more dangerous for all of us: stay at home at this critical moment.
此外，如果可以的话，告诉你身边的人一切小心，并帮助意大利的医院们。
And, if you can, tell everyone around you to be careful and help Italian hospitals.
”与此同时，她也在文中阐释了自己家乡意大利的疫情情况。
At the same time, she explained the situation in her hometown of Italy.
她提到意大利病例十分多，且许多人无法得到有效救治，因为医院还没有做好准备去应对越来越恶劣的情况。
She mentioned the high number of cases in Italy and the fact that many people could not be effectively treated because hospitals were not ready to deal with the worsening situation.
她因此已发起众筹帮助米兰的一家医院。
She has therefore launched a crowdfunding campaign to help a hospital in Milan.
意大利时尚博主Chiara Ferragni通过Instagram呼吁粉丝注意防护新冠病毒Ferragni的Instagram账号在发文当日有约1870万粉丝。
The Italian fashion blogger Chiara Ferragni, through Instagram, called the attention of fans to the Instagram account for protection against the new cap virus Ferragni, which had some 18.7 million fans on the day of dispatch.
截至发稿，该条更新得到了超过105万次的点赞。
As at the time of writing, the update had received more than 1.05 million comments.
但从这条推文的评论区可以看到，不少外国粉丝并未对她的呼吁做出正面回应。
But from the comments section of this post, many foreign fans have not responded positively to her appeal.
一部分人认为她大题小做，坚称这就是另一次流感；也有人并不买账一位时尚博主的号召和呼吁，纠结于为什么戴着口罩的她还化了眼妆、穿得漂亮，淡化了本应之于病毒和疫情的关注。
Some people think she's making a fuss, insisting it's another flu; others don't heed the call and call of a fashion blogger to wonder why the masked woman still wears eye makeup and dresses that dilute concerns about the virus and the epidemic.
事实上，意大利在近段时间已成为全球新增病例最多、疫情发展最快的国家。
Indeed, Italy has recently become the country with the highest number of new cases and the fastest-growing epidemic in the world.
据世界卫生组织（WHO）数据，截至欧洲中部时间2020年3月11日上午10时，除中国外，全球113个国家及地区累计报告确诊病例37371例，新增确诊4596例，累计死亡1130例。
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of 10 a.m. on March 11, 2020, outside China, a total of 37,371 confirmed cases, 4,596 new cases and a cumulative total of 1,130 deaths had been reported in 113 countries and regions worldwide.
其中，意大利新增确诊数达到977例。
Of these, 977 new diagnoses were recorded in Italy.
3月12日，首个中国抗疫援外专家组飞赴意大利展开海外医疗援助。
On March 12, the first Chinese team of foreign aid experts flew to Italy to start overseas medical assistance.
疫情带来的负面影响牵涉方方面面，除了威胁公众健康，影响正常生活生产秩序，不同产业的发展状态也或多或少受到冲击。
The negative impact of the epidemic involves many aspects, in addition to threatening public health, affecting the normal order of life and production, the development of different industries has been more or less impacted.
在疫情尚未发展至如此严重地步的更早些时候，意大利的时尚产业已饱受打击。
Italy's fashion industry has been hit hard earlier, before the epidemic reached such a point.
2月下旬举办的米兰时装周的活动就受到了影响。
The Milan Fashion Week, held in late February, was affected.
意大利奢侈品牌Dolce&Gabbana发布会按警方要求不得不准点开秀，导致数十位迟到的买手和编辑们被迫在米兰市中心Viale Piave的秀场上方的画廊内看完了大秀；GiorgioArmani则直接取消了新一季大秀的现场发布，转而在空秀场内进行直播发布，并于后几日关闭了位于米兰的总部办公室及多家工厂。
Italy's luxury brand Dolce & amp; Gabbana has been ordered to perform on time, forcing dozens of belated buyers and editors to watch the show at a gallery in central Milan's Viale Piave show, while Giorgio Armani canceled a live release of the show and broadcast it live on the runway, closing its Milan headquarters and factories a few days later.
GiorgioArmani 2020秋冬季米兰大秀秀场外取消在米兰活动的还包括美国轻奢品牌Michael Kors。
Giorgio Armani's suspension from Milan in the autumn and winter of 2020 also includes the American luxury brand Michael Kors.
该品牌原计划为推广品牌与最新007系列电影《无暇赴死 》合作的胶囊系列，将在米兰举办新闻发布会及庆祝酒会。
The brand had planned to hold a press conference and reception in Milan to promote the brand's capsule line in collaboration with the latest 007 movie "No Time to Die."
而原定于2月29日至3月2日在米兰举办的Mido眼镜贸易展也宣布推迟举办，目前重新举办的日期并未公布。
The Mido Glasses Trade Fair, originally scheduled to be held in Milan from 29 February to 2 March, was also postponed and the date for its relaunch has not been announced.
资本市场也快速反映了这些冲击带来的影响。
Capital markets are also quick to reflect the impact of these shocks.
意大利奢侈品集团股价集体下跌，其中Tod’s股价一度大跌11.1%，Salvatore Ferragamo股价也曾下跌9.2%，Safilo集团股价跌幅达到8.2%，Moncler股价也最多下跌过5.8%。
Share prices of Italian luxury goods groups fell, with Tod's shares plunging 11.1%, Salvatore Ferragamo down 9.2%, Safilo Group down 8.2% and Moncler down 5.8% at most.
GUCCI 2020秋冬大秀秀场，可见现场人流密集意大利只是全球时尚行业在此次新冠疫情中遭受打击的其中一个例子而已。
GUCCI 2020 autumn and winter show, the scene crowded Italy is only one example of the global fashion industry suffered in the new crown epidemic.
受新冠肺炎在全球范围内持续蔓延的影响，原定在3月中下旬举办的首尔时装周、东京时装周相继取消；上海时装周则从线下模式转为与天猫合作的线上发布；本该在5月开始陆续举行的奢侈品牌度假系列大秀，也于近日开始传出取消或改期的消息——目前确定取消或推迟举办度假系列大秀的品牌包括Gucci、Prada、Hermes等；这两天，受邀在Gucci、Saint Laurent等大秀头排看秀的越南名媛确诊新冠病毒的消息，更是进一步引发了时尚界业内人士对于行业前景的担忧和恐慌。
Seoul Fashion Week, originally scheduled for late March, and Tokyo Fashion Week were canceled, while Shanghai Fashion Week shifted from offline fashion to online partnerships with cats. The latest cancellations or reappointments began in May, when Vietnam's leading celebrities such as Gucci, Saint Laurent and others were invited to confirm the new crown virus.
联合国贸易和发展会议发布的分析报告《冠状病毒（COVID-19）对全球贸易的影响》显示，全球纺织服装产业将此次因疫情损失超15亿美元（约合人民币104亿元），遭遇损失的企业所在的国家覆盖全球。
The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development's analysis of the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) on global trade shows that the global textile and clothing industry will lose more than $1.5 billion (10.4 billion yuan) of the epidemic, with companies suffering losses in countries around the world.
而根据意大利奢侈品协会Altagamma、咨询公司BCG和资产管理公司Bernstein的最新调查报告，2020年全球奢侈品公司将损失至少100亿欧元利润。
And according to the latest survey by Altagamma, an Italian luxury goods association, BCG, a consultancy, and Bernstein, an asset management firm, global luxury goods companies will lose at least €10 billion in profits in 2020.
而且大多数参与调查者均预测，此次疫情对全球奢侈品市场的负面影响将持续到未来3个月至半年内。
And most respondents predict the epidemic's negative impact on the global luxury-goods market will continue for the next three to six months.
