像我这样一个心脏移植患者都能康复，相信能给更多人信心——这个病毒并不可怕。
A heart transplant patient like me who recovers is believed to give more people confidence that the virus is not terrible.
口述 | 秦 天（化名）整理 | 沈 林2月11日，我从武汉金银潭出院了。
At the time I was discharged from Wuhan on February 11, I was discharged from Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool.
对于一个心脏移植患者来说，这很不容易，就算是感染了普通的感冒，对我都是很危险的，因为我长期口服的抗排异药物，本身就会降低人的免疫力和抵抗力。
For a heart transplant patient, it's not easy, and even a common cold can be dangerous for me, because my long-term oral anti-rejection drugs can themselves reduce immunity and resistance.
治疗期间，我好几次都觉得很害怕很绝望，身体状况最差的时候，还给妻子写了遗书，告诉她后事怎么处理，孩子怎么办，但很多人给了我无私的帮助和温暖的安慰，我能康复，很感谢他们。
During the treatment, I felt scared and desperate several times. At the worst of my condition, I wrote a suicide note to my wife telling her how to deal with the situation and what to do with her children.
我还记得我发病的那天，是1月23日，凌晨我突然发烧了，用了点退烧药，体温下去了，人的状态还是很差，就去附近的医院看了看，打了4天针，但是人还是很乏力，医院的医生说我这不是普通感冒，怀疑我是新冠肺炎，要赶紧去定点医院做进一步检查，综合考虑之下，我去了协和做检查。
I remember the day of my illness, January 23, I suddenly had a fever, used some antipyretics, the temperature went down, people are still very weak, but the hospital doctors said I was not a common cold, suspected that I was new crown pneumonia, we have to hurry to a point hospital for further examination, under consideration, I went to Concorde.
协和也是我做心脏移植的医院，说起来，我之所以要换心，也是因为一场感冒，2014年的时候，我一直很忙，咳嗽了好几个月也没有管它，实在拖到很严重了才去医院检查，发现得了心肌炎，之后病情恶化成扩张型心肌病，2017年的时候，协和医院帮我做了心脏移植手术，到现在还一直在吃抗排异的药物。
Concorde, the hospital where I had a heart transplant, said I had to change my heart because of a cold. In 2014, I was so busy that I coughed for months before I went to the hospital for a check-up.
现在回想，因为我每个月都要去医院开抗排异的药，我要么就是1月份在医院拿药的时候感染上的新冠病毒，要么就是去家乐福买东西的时候感染上的。
Now, in retrospect, because I have to go to the hospital every month to get an anti-rejection drug, I either got the new crown virus when I got it at the hospital in January, or I got it while I was shopping at Carrefour.
后来在协和，我就确诊得了新冠肺炎。
Then at Concorde I was diagnosed with New Crown Pneumonia.
在协和确诊后，我第一时间联系了此前帮我做过手术的刘金平教授，他虽然人在美国进修，但是我联系他，他很关心我的情况，一直在指导我，他跟我说，这个病药物是一个方面，个人的情绪也很重要，他让我一定要坚持，一定要吃东西。
After Concorde's diagnosis, I first contacted Professor Liu Jinping, who had previously operated on me. Although he was studying in the United States, I contacted him. He was very concerned about my condition and had been guiding me.
确诊后，我也跟社区打了电话上报了一下，因为一时半会医院没有床位给我，所以我先在家里自我隔离。
After the diagnosis, I also called the community to report, because half of the hospital had no beds for me, so I isolated myself at home.
我确诊后回家就跟妻子分房生活了，孩子也被送到了老人家里照顾。
After I was diagnosed, I went home to live with my wife, and the children were taken care of by the elderly.
我和妻子通过微信来联系，包括拿饭菜拿空碗洗澡，都提前联系好，错时进行，所以虽然生活在同一个房子里，但我们没有打过照面。
My wife and I contacted each other by micromail, including taking an empty bowl and taking a bath, all in advance. So we lived in the same house, but we never met.
当时的感觉是很无力的，整个人躺在床上起不来，每天都很沮丧。
At that time, the feeling is very weak, the whole person lying in bed can not get up, every day is very depressed.
而且我和妻子虽然没有直接的交流，但我听到她的声音，我也知道她肯定哭了很多次，照顾我也费了很多心力。
And although my wife and I did not have direct communication, but I heard her voice, I also know that she must have cried many times, took a lot of care of me.
妻子那段时间看新闻，看到有个人喝鸡汤喝好了，大概是鸡汤对提高身体免疫力有好处，她就帮我炖了鸡汤，我喝了以后，拉肚子，整个人很不好，吃了点肠胃药才停止腹泻。
When my wife read the news and saw someone drink chicken soup, it was probably good for the body immunity, she helped me stew chicken soup, I drank, diarrhea is very bad, took a little gastrointestinal medicine to stop diarrhea.
刘教授说可能是鸡汤太油腻了，后来妻子就把鸡汤倒掉了。
Professor Liu said it might be chicken soup was too greasy, and then his wife poured it out.
但不知道为什么，第二天我觉得身体有了些力气，也有了食欲，慢慢可以进食了，那段时间我吃的是莫西沙星和阿比多尔，也不知道有没有起到效果。
But I don't know why, the next day I felt a little stronger, I had an appetite, I was eating moxifloxacin and abidor, and I didn't know if it was working.
在这期间，我的抗排异药物快吃完了，如果不能及时拿到药的话，一旦器官和自己的身体产生排斥，就会威胁我的生命。
In the meantime, my anti-rejection medication is running out, and if I don't get it in time, once the organs and my body reject it, it threatens my life.
我就打电话给社区希望能得到帮助。
I called the community hoping for help.
其实我刚刚搬到这个社区没多久，对社区的运转不是很熟悉，但我运气很好，碰到一个很负责的工作人员，彭宏同志。
It wasn't long before I moved to this community and I wasn't really familiar with the workings of the community, but I was lucky enough to meet a responsible staff member, Comrade Peng Hong.
我不知道他的职位，就连名字也是最近才搞清楚的，之前打电话一直喊“陈主任”，他也不纠正我，但我整个治疗期间，他给予了我们家特别多的关照，我隔离期间都是他请人帮我们送菜。
I do not know his position, even the name is only recently clear, before calling "Director Chen", he did not correct me, but throughout my treatment, he gave us a special care of our family, I seclusion was all he asked someone to help us deliver food.
我的抗排异药物快用完的时候，他还主动联系车辆送我妻子去协和拿药，之后方舱医院建好了，也是他通知我过去。
When I was running out of anti-rejection drugs, he also volunteered to contact the car to take my wife to Concorde to get the medicine, after which the cabin hospital was built, he also informed me to go.
住在方舱医院期间2月6日，我住进了方舱医院，但是当时那里的环境还比较乱，旁边床位的病人时不时地咳嗽，还有发烧病人，我刚有点好起来，心里有点害怕，刘教授也让我尽量不要跟这么多病人住在一起，毕竟我做过心脏移植，免疫力比较差。
During my stay in the Fang Cavern Hospital on February 6, I was admitted to the Fangcao Hospital, but the environment there was still quite chaotic, with patients with beds coughing from time to time, and feverish patients.
我跟方舱医院里的医生说了我的情况，我没记住他的名字，只知道他是天津医疗队的医生，他得知我的情况后，就联系帮我转院。
I told the doctor at the cabin hospital about me. I didn't remember his name, only that he was a doctor with the Tianjin medical team.
于是当天晚上，我住进了金银潭医院的病房。
So that night I was admitted to the ward of the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital.
住院的时候，我每天都从这个窗户看窗外跟我一个病房的，还有方舱医院转过来的重症患者。
When I was in the hospital, I looked out the window at my ward every day, along with patients in serious condition who had been transferred from the cabin hospital.
我住在综合楼，这里的病房是重症和轻症一起收的，一个病房里有3张床，我住在中间，我旁边是一个70多岁的老大爷，前两天状态很差，血压忽高忽低，大小便失禁，生活完全不能自理，连监护器都上了，看着老大爷的样子，我心理压力很大，也跟医院申请想换病房的，但是金银潭没有多余的病床了，所以就被迫一起住了几天，那些天我没怎么休息好。
There were three beds in one ward, and I lived in the middle. Next to me was a grandfather in my 70s, who was in bad shape the previous two days.
幸好，抢救了两三天后，老大爷的情况慢慢好转了，我快出院的时候，他已经可以自己吃饭上厕所了。
Fortunately, after two or three days of rescue, the old man's condition gradually improved, and when I was about to leave hospital, he was able to eat his own food to go to the toilet.
住在我另一边的是一个27岁的博士，他看上去精神不太好，但他个人感觉还好，不过医生说他的CT片子照出来肺部感染很严重，几乎全白了，属于重症患者。
On the other side of me was a 27-year-old doctor who looked not so well, but personally he felt fine, but doctors said his CT scan showed a very serious, almost all-white lung infection.
还有一个加床的病人也睡在我们病房，他是参加过新闻里说的那个万人宴，不过他跟我一样，属于轻症病人。
There was also a patient with extra beds who slept in our ward. He had attended the mass dinner on the news, but he was, like me, a mild case.
金银潭的医生对我们很温柔细致，因为我当时已经没有什么不舒服了，所以入院后只做了一些检查，也没有给我开药，我还有些担心。
The Gold and Silver Pool doctors were very gentle with us, because I was not feeling very well, so I only had a few tests after admission, and I didn't prescribe any medicine.
医生说他对我们每个人的病情都很了解，看了我的验血报告，都是比较正常的，不需要进行药物治疗，只做隔离和观察。
The doctor said that he knew everything about each of us, and had seen my blood test report, which was quite normal and did not require medication, only isolation and observation.
我在金银潭呆了5天，2月11日医生通知我可以出院了。
I spent five days in the gold and silver pool. On February 11, my doctor told me that I could leave the hospital.
本来央视要采访我，我觉得我并不算金银潭的一个典型病例，所以就拒绝了。
CCTV was going to interview me, I do not think I am a typical case of gold and silver pool, so refused.
出院的时候，我带着病历本去结账，工作人员告诉我，我一分钱都不需要花，政府已经帮我买单了。
When I got out of the hospital, I brought my medical record book with me. The staff told me that I didn't need to spend a cent.
那天，我还把住院期间穿过的衣服都扔掉了，还有住院用的洗脸盆子也都扔掉了。
That day, I threw away all the clothes I had worn in the hospital, as well as all the washbasins I used in the hospital.
这是央视拍到的我这里还有一个小插曲，出院的时候我身份证、医保卡没有带在身上，于是我又打电话给彭宏，他在电话里听到我要出院了很开心，很快就答应帮我安排车送过来，我说能不能顺便带我回家，他也一口答应了。
When I left the hospital, I didn't have my ID card or medical care card with me. So I called Peng Hong again. He was very happy to hear that I was going to be discharged from hospital.
不过，后来我才知道出院的病人必须统一乘坐一辆公交车离院，所以就没有坐彭宏给我安排的车。
Later, however, I learned that discharged patients had to leave the hospital on a single bus, so I did not take the bus that Peng Hong had arranged for me.
其实我还有很多要感谢他的，一个社区很大，我也只是给社区的公共电话打了一次，他就记住了我的情况，主动手机打给我问我的情况，后来我就一直保存着他的手机号，之前我病情不稳定的时候，住不上院很烦躁，经常打电话给他，有的时候甚至是埋怨他，跟他发火，还骂他是骗子，但他从来没有拒接过我的电话，一直都是很耐心地安慰我鼓励我帮助我，而我甚至没有叫对过他的名字，直到现在，我也没有见过他的面。
In fact, I have a lot to thank him, a large community, I just called the community phone once, he remembered my situation, active mobile phones called me to ask me about his mobile phone, I always kept his mobile phone number, sometimes even complained about him, angry with him, and called him a liar, but he never refused to take my call.
说实话，我觉得我当时的粗鲁，亲戚朋友也许可以忍受，但是他作为一个陌生人，能够这样帮助我，我心里真的很感激，这也是为什么我主动联系媒体，想要把我的这段经历写出来的原因。
To tell the truth, I thought my rudeness might have been tolerated by my relatives and friends, but as a stranger, I was really grateful that he was able to help me in this way, which is why I contacted the media and wanted to write about my experience.
另一个原因就是，像我这样一个心脏移植患者都能康复，相信能给更多人信心——这个病毒并不可怕。
Another reason is that a heart transplant patient like me can recover and hopefully give more people confidence that the virus is not terrible.
