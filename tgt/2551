点击上方物质生活参考加星标！物质生活参考作者：赵小薇来源：物质生活参考（ID：wzshck）01.回到北京第一天，王萌从药箱、抽屉、储藏柜里翻出了四十多个口罩，包括两包一次性口罩、一包一次性医用外科口罩，以及几个高级货：n95。
On her first day back in Beijing, Wang Meng pulled out more than 40 masks from medicine boxes, drawers and lockers, including two disposable masks, a package of disposable medical surgical masks, and several high-end products: n95.
N95是前两年雾霾严重时特意买的，其他的口罩，则是以往买药的“凑单品”。
N95 was bought in the first two years when the haze was severe. Other masks were "scrounged" pieces of medicine purchased in the past.
跟生活在这个城市中的很多年轻人一样，王萌的家庭用药几乎全部来自外卖中的医药频道或是送药app。
Like many young people living in the city, Ms. Wang's home remedies came almost entirely from the medicine channel in takeaway or from drug delivery.
这类采购一般会有设置起送门槛，更多的时候，王萌是为了凑够满50减20一类的促销活动。
Such purchases usually have set a delivery threshold, and more often, Wang Meng has made an effort to fill the 50 minus 20 category.
没人能想到，彼时低价的凑单品，在这个冬天，成了一罩难求的硬通货。
No one can imagine, that time cheap patchwork, in this winter, has become a hard currency difficult to obtain.
王萌至今也没再买过口罩。
Wang has not bought another mask so far.
确切地说，是没再买到过。
Actually, I haven't bought any more.
她前后在网上下过七八笔订单，各个购物平台都有，微博上信任的博主代购也试过，但最后不是被退款，就是直到现在还没有发货动静。
She placed seven or eight orders online, on every shopping platform, and even bloggers trusted on Weibo have tried, but were either refunded or have not shipped yet.
她庆幸自己无意之中囤积了求生必需品，但也后悔节前没有支持家人年前多买些口罩的决定。
She was glad she had inadvertently hoarded life necessities, but regretted not supporting her family's decision to buy more masks a year ago.
“当时药店里已经有人十包十包地买，我还跟劝阻我妈，说不要囤货，留给更需要的人用。
"There were already 10 bags and ten packs in the drugstore, and I tried to dissuade my mother from stocking up and leaving it for the more needy.
”王萌说，那时候疫情并不严重，一是觉得疫区人民更需要，二是很乐观地认为，春节后产能一上来，口罩自然够用。
'At that time, the epidemic was not serious, because people in the affected areas felt more need of it, and there was optimism that the masks would be sufficient as soon as production capacity comes up after the Spring Festival, 'she said.
为了给自己的盲目乐观“赎罪”，她给爸妈寄去了自己手里的一多半口罩。
To atone for her blind optimism, she sent her parents more than half of her mask.
除了口罩，王萌还在柜子里翻出了三小瓶75%的酒精，两盒一次性手套，两瓶84消毒液，一小包酒精棉片。
In addition to her mask, Wang turned out three small bottles of 75% alcohol in the cupboard, two disposable gloves, two bottles of disinfectant 84, and a small package of alcohol cotton.
酒精是某次挤伤趾甲上药前消毒用的，药店一小瓶10块，网购6小瓶19；一次性手套则是当年对烘焙热爱的见证。
Alcohol is used to disinfect your toenails at one time, a small bottle of 10 in a drugstore and six bottles of 19 on the Internet. Disposable gloves are a testament to the love of baking.
热爱囤积的习性在网上被称为“仓鼠症”，大概是因为这种动物两腮滚滚适宜储存食物，德语中，“存储”一词即为“仓鼠”。
The habit of hoarding is known online as hamster disease, presumably because the animal has gills that allow it to store food. In German, the word "stored" means hamster.
作为独自生活在大城市的单身女性，王萌对自己的“仓鼠”本性有着清晰认识。
As a single woman living alone in a big city, Wang Meng had a clear understanding of her hamster nature.
一方面，囤货是出于安全感需要，生活必需品她总要多买一份，以备不时之需；另一方面，她有些宿命地将其归结于金牛座特质，满减活动、第二件0元、买三免一等等促销手段激发的是她的购物欲也是征服欲，意图精打细算与商家一决高下的代价，就是囤货越来越多。
On the one hand, the hoarding of goods was dictated by the need for security, and she always bought more of them for a rainy day. On the other hand, she fatally ascribed them to the Taurus traits.
这个冬天到来之时，正是双十一、双十二两轮重要周期性战役。
This winter is coming, it is Double-eleven, twelve rounds of important cyclical campaigns.
因此，家里的洗衣液、消毒液、卫生纸甚至米面粮油，都处于饱和状态。
As a result, the home washing liquid, disinfectant, toilet paper and even rice flour oil, are in a state of saturation.
在北京这个物资相对齐备、配送比较迅速的城市，这样的囤积原本不觉必要，但小区封闭、快递不能进入后，从大门口手提肩扛再爬上楼的操作，让采购生活物资的难度直线上升。
In Beijing, a relatively well-stocked and fast-moving city, such hoarding may not have been necessary, but the practice of holding a hand-held shoulder at the gate and climbing upstairs after the cell blocks are closed and express delivery is not possible has made the procurement of living materials more difficult.
“我的命都是‘仓鼠症’给的。
My life was given to me by Hamster Disease.
”真正意义上地死宅在家一个月后，王萌说。
'said Wang, a month after she had been in the real estate.
02.在收藏了朋友圈一份“末日生存指南”的家用物资储备清单后，李晓感叹：多年“断舍离”功力一朝被废。
After collecting a list of his friends' "end-of-life guide" to his household goods inventory, Li Xiaoli lamented that years of "letting go" had been wasted.
她是极简生活推崇者。
She is a minimalist admirer of life.
购物理性克制，收纳井井有条，每季度对家中物品进行清理和归纳。
Shopping rational restraint, well-organized, quarterly household items clean up and summarize.
因此，虽然家中有一只猫和一个热爱买书和零食的老公，目之所及，大环境依旧空旷干净。
Therefore, although the family has a cat and a love of buying books and snacks husband, the environment is still open and clean.
与许多“断舍离”拥趸者一样，李晓的入门书籍是山下英子的《断舍离》，以及近藤麻理惠的《怦然心动的人生整理魔法》，前者讲理念，后者讲实践。
Like many "break away" fans, Li Xiao's primer is Yasuko Yamashita's "Broken House" and Kondo's "The Aggressive Sorcery in Life," the former about ideas and the second about practice.
在坚持了三年之后，李晓觉得生活很清爽，购物欲望也极大降低，“特别适合消费降级后的生活”。
After three years of persistence, Li Xiao felt that life was refreshing and the desire to shop was greatly reduced, "especially suitable for life after the downgrade of consumption."
李晓也承认，对极简与“断舍离”的推崇，一部分源于自己对生活的控制欲，要想所有物品分类清晰、摆放有序，就必须控制数量；另一部分则是蜗居的残酷现实。
Li admitted that the reverence for minimalism and "quitting" stems partly from one's desire to control one's life, one must control quantity if one wants all things to be clearly classified and well-arranged, and the other is the cruel reality of squalor.
每当与老公因要不要扔、要不要买发生争执，她都会举出寸土寸金的离谱房价作为论据：我们差的是买东西的钱吗？你要算算它要占多少空间——空间就是钱！但她没想这一次会折戟沙场。
Whenever she argued with her husband about whether to throw it away or buy it, she would cite the outrageous price of a house. Was it the money we needed to buy? You had to figure out how much space it would take - space was money! But she didn't think she would break up the sandyard this time.
首先出问题的是猫。
The cat was the first to go wrong.
年前她家里还存有三袋猫砂，这基本是她存储的极限值。
She also had three bags of cat litter in her house a year ago, which is basically the limit for her storage.
没想到挨到2月，猫砂眼看着见底，但快递还是送不到小区。
Unexpectedly next to February, the cat trachoma to see the bottom, but express still can not send to the community.
最终，李晓在网上超市下了单，选了一个坐地铁要一小时车程的快递总站，四天后冒着巨大风险出了门。
Finally, Li Xiaoxiao online supermarket under the order, selected a subway to take an hour's drive to the express terminal, four days later took great risks out of the door.
一袋猫砂六斤，李晓两口子拖回家六包。
A bag of cat sand six jin, Li Xiao and his wife drag home six bags.
经此一役，她感到身心备受打击，甚至动了“训练狸花猫用马桶”的心思。
After this battle, she felt a physical and psychological shock, even moved "beaver cat toilet training" mind.
另一重打击是，在给父母采购生活用品时，一贯靠谱京东居然淀粉缺货，淘宝下单后，足足等了两周才收到货。
Another heavy blow, in the procurement of daily necessities for parents, has always relied on the Peking East starch stock, Taobao ordered, fully waited for two weeks before receiving the goods.
还有人完全出不了门。
There are others who can't leave the house.
李晓闺蜜小安的父母都在湖北荆州，一度面临断菜。
Li Xiaomi's parents, both in Jingzhou, Hubei, once faced a cut-off.
最终让老两口挨过最艰难一段的，是囤积在橱柜里的木耳、花菇、黄花菜、红薯粉……李晓有点儿后怕：换成自己这个小家，极端情况下估计最多只能坚持一周。
It was the wooden ears, mushrooms, cauliflower, sweet potato powder that hoarded up in the cupboard that finally put the old couple through the hardest part... Li Xiao was a bit afraid of changing into his own little home, and in extreme cases he could only hold out for a week at the most.
在收藏了家用物资储备清单后，她按照单子开始了采购计划：净水片、大容量充电宝、医疗箱、工具箱……她甚至在网上找到了美国Costco销售的 “世界末日食品包”，食品包包括各种冻干，脱水和即食食品，保质期在25到30年之间。
She even found the Doomsday Package sold by Costco in the United States, which includes freeze-dried, dehydrated and ready-to-eat foods with a shelf life of between 25 and 30 years.
当然，价格也很可观：一年份的高级套装要6000美元。
Of course, the price is pretty good: $6,000 a year for a high-end suit.
从一个极端到另一个极端，在李晓看来，精神内核是一样的：缺乏安全感，希望更牢靠地掌控生活。
From one extreme to the other, in Li Xiao's view, the spiritual core is the same: a lack of security and a desire to take control of life more firmly.
“‘断舍离’是要有社会整体保障作基础的，比如外卖、网购、交通都很便利，个人资金储备相对充足，才可能放心去舍弃。
"" Brokeout is based on overall social security, such as take-out, online shopping, transportation are very convenient, personal financial reserves are relatively sufficient, can be abandoned.
“她说，这个冬天让她感到生活背景设定相对还很脆弱，看似便利的一切，似乎也都不那么稳妥。
"This winter, she says, has made her feel relatively vulnerable in her life setting, and everything that seems convenient seems less secure.
03.知乎上最近一个问题很火：这次疫情之后，你还会“断舍离”吗？大声呼喊“绝不”的人，大多是刚吃了亏的入门级选手。
3. Know that one of the most recent problems is: Will you ever "quit" after this outbreak? Most of the people who shout "never" are beginners who have just suffered a loss.
悲催故事多有相似：在不久前某次心血来潮的断舍离当中，扔掉了口罩、手套、酒精、旧雨衣，或是临期的零食、大米、玉米油，还有人哭诉，春节前刚刚扔掉近视手术后医生给的护目镜，“以为一辈子都用不上了！”尽管有些口罩确实是因为过了保质期才被舍弃，但在这个口罩奇缺的时期，即便是过期了一段时间，也绝对要比裸奔上阵更安全。
In a recent emotional parting, throw away masks, gloves, alcohol, old raincoats, or just-in-time snacks, rice, corn oil, and crying that the glasses given by your doctor just before Spring Festival will never work!
因此，当“断舍离”派人士略带讥讽地表示“那些爱囤货的人也不囤口罩”时，一些从角落里翻出了航空公司赠品口罩的囤积派人士，严正提出了抗议。
So some hoarders who rummaged around the corner for airline masks protested sternly when the breakaway personage sarcastically said, "Those who hoard goods do not hoard a mask."
还有人举出去年近藤麻理惠卖货事件，这位写出《怦然心动的人生整理魔法》的“断舍离”达人，因在个人网站上高价售卖生活用品而饱受诟病，“让我们扔掉‘不心动’的东西，就是为了买她的货吗？”网友对她本人的质疑，一度上升到对“断舍离”合理性的怀疑之上。
Others point to last year's sale of Kondo's Matsushita, who wrote "The Banging Magic of Life," which was criticized for selling high-priced items on personal websites. "Let's throw things out of our minds just to buy her wares?" netizens questioned her once rising above doubts about the reasonableness of "breaking away."
[1]而在“断舍离”理念的发源地日本，在“生活用纸将要紧缺”的谣言影响下，多地已经出现抢卫生纸风波。
And at the birthplace of Rai's philosophy, Japan, where toilet paper is in short supply, there has been a stampede for toilet paper.
[2]大本营面临沦陷，但仍有人奋力高举“断舍离”大旗。
AT RATE & # 91; & # 93; & # 39; & # 39; & # 39; & # 39; & # 39; & # 39; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
柳南是其中之一。
Liu Nan is one of them.
在他看来，误解源自国人对断舍离内涵的误读。
In his view, the misunderstanding originates from the Chinese people's misreading of the connotation of renunciation.
“‘断舍离’并不是单纯的‘扔扔扔’”，柳南说，比起无目的无原则的扔，‘断舍离’的动作更为精准有目的：“断绝不需要的东西，舍弃多余的废物，脱离对物品的执着”。
'Losing is not simply throwing away, 'says Mr. Yoonan.' It's more precise and purposeful than throwing away without purpose: 'Cut off what you don't need, throw away your extra waste, and detach yourself from your attachment to objects.
因此，怎么界定“不需要”和“多余”，才是问题的关键所在。
So how to define "unnecessary" and "superfluous" is the crux of the matter.
在这个维度上，疫情之下，许多人都完成了对不必要生活的生动实践：饭局被舍弃，酒局被舍弃，聚会被舍弃，不必要的寒暄被舍弃，如今居家办公的柳南觉得，除了更轻松，人生似乎也没有什么不同。
In this dimension, many people have performed the vivid practice of living unnecessarily: meals are abandoned, wine is abandoned, parties are abandoned, unnecessary pleasantries are abandoned, and now, in addition to being more relaxed, life seems to be no different.
还有人借此机会进一步舍弃了朋友圈里的一些存在，“疫情就是试金石”，柳南说，“你以为自己早就清理干净了，但总有人会跳出来，花样挑战你的忍耐底线。
There are also those who take the opportunity to further abandon some of the existence of the circle of friends, "epidemic is the touchstone," Liu said. "You think you have cleaned up, but someone will jump out and challenge you to the bottom line.
”他甚至借机退掉了几个群，微信首页小红圈瞬间清爽。
He even took the opportunity to back out of several groups, micro-letter home circle immediately refreshing.
“处理物品时还可以带一点惜物之心，但对于三观不合的人，‘断舍离’绝不能手软。
"You can treat things with a little bit of kindness, but for those who don't agree, 'Broken off' must not be soft.
”这位高段位“断舍离”选手这样说。
"said the high-level" Brokeout "player.
