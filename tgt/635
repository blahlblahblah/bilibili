流调的目的是获取被调查者的发病史、旅行史、接触史等信息，为分析疫情的传播路径、控制疫情进一步传播提供关键的依据。
The aim of the shift is to obtain information on the history of disease, travel history and contact history of the subjects, and to provide a key basis for the analysis of the spread of the epidemic and the control of its further spread.
记者 | 王 煜交接完标本、脱下一整套防护装备，上海长宁区疾控中心的两名年轻的工作人员杨雨帆和蒋亭安走进食堂，这里的晚餐供应已接近尾声。
When Wang handed over his specimen and took off a set of protective equipment, two young workers from the CDC in Changning District of Shanghai, Yang Yufan and Jiang Tingan, walked into the dining hall, where dinner was nearing its end.
这是1月30日的傍晚，两个小姑娘刚刚执行完一次对新冠肺炎疑似病例的流行病学调查（简称“流调”）和运送标本的任务。
It was the evening of January 30, when two young girls had just completed an epidemiological investigation of suspected cases of pneumonia ("drift") and a task of transporting specimens.
这次回来算是赶上了晚餐时间的尾巴，而她们当天的待命时段是全天24小时。
This time it was the end of dinner time, and they were on call 24 hours a day.
无论白天黑夜，只要辖区内相关医院有疑似病例的信息发来，她们就要立即全副武装赶往现场，走进隔离病房，与疑似患者近距离交流。
Day and night, as long as the relevant hospital in the jurisdiction of information on suspected cases, they are immediately armed to the scene, walk into the isolation ward, and suspect close communication.
疾控工作人员，或许是一线医护人员之外，与疫情距离最近的一群人。
CDC workers, perhaps outside the front-line medical staff, are the closest group to the epidemic.
1月26日，长宁区疾控中心工作人员（右一右二）与同仁医院医护人员在新冠肺炎流调现场图：长宁疾控流调的目的是获取被调查者的发病史、旅行史、接触史等信息，为分析疫情的传播路径、控制疫情进一步传播提供关键的依据。
January 26, Changning District CDC staff (right, right) and Tongren Hospital medical personnel in the New Crown Pneumonia Transfer Site Map: The purpose of Changning CDC is to obtain information on the disease history, travel history and contact history of the subjects, thus providing a key basis for the analysis of the spread of the epidemic and the control of its further spread.
例如，一旦疑似患者被确诊，疾控中心的工作人员就立即按照流调获取的信息，寻找确诊患者密切接触过的人员，对他们采取相应的医学观察等措施。
For example, once a suspected patient is diagnosed, the CDC staff immediately follow the information obtained from the transfer to find people who have been in close contact with the confirmed patient and take appropriate medical observations.
因此，调查中她们要做到尽量细致。
Therefore, they should be as meticulous as possible in the survey.
疑似患者最近一段时间去过哪里、密切接触过哪些人、乘坐的交通工具的班次等，这些信息，了解得能多详细就多详细。
The information is as detailed as possible as to where the suspected patient has been in recent times, who he has been in close contact with, the number of flights on which he travels, etc.
碰到对方记不清楚的，她们还要想办法帮助对方尽量回忆。
They also try to help each other remember things that they can't remember clearly.
一次流调，通常要花上半小时到一小时，这还不包括穿脱防护装备的时间。
One shift, which usually takes between half an hour and an hour, does not include the time spent wearing protective gear.
流调完成后，如果需要对疑似患者进行标本取样的，她们还要等待医院的取样完成，并换上新的一套防护装备，将标本送回疾控中心进行检测。
After the transfer is completed, if samples of the suspected patient need to be sampled, they will have to wait for the hospital to complete the sampling and replace it with a new set of protective equipment and return the specimen to the CDC for testing.
目前，上海的区级疾控中心已经可以自行检测新冠肺炎疑似患者的标本，长宁疾控的微生物检验实验室24小时运转，尽快提供检测结果。
Currently, the Shanghai-based CDC has been able to test specimens of suspected patients with new crown pneumonia on its own. The Changning CDC microbiological laboratory operates 24 hours a day, providing test results as soon as possible.
长宁区疾控中心工作人员穿戴防护装备，准备出发执行取样任务摄影：王煜长宁疾控中心副主任蔡恩茂说：平时流调任务的执行以传染病防制科的人员为主，他们是第一梯队；而这次的疫情防控任务重大，来自其他科室的第二梯队的人员也直接进入一线工作。
Changning District CDC staff wearing protective equipment, ready to set out to carry out sampling mission photography: Normally the transfer task is mainly carried out by staff of the infectious disease control division, they are the first echelons, and this time the prevention and control mission is significant, from other departments of the second echelons of personnel directly into the front-line work.
杨雨帆和蒋亭安就是平时的第二梯队成员。
Yang Yufan and Jiang Tingan are usually members of the second echelon.
入职分别只有一年多、两年多的她们告诉《新民周刊》记者，刚刚结束的这次任务，是她俩第一次真正走进流调的现场。
More than a year into their careers and more than two years into their careers, they told Newsweek that the mission that had just ended was the first time they had actually made it into the flow.
“虽然我们之前都参加过很多次演练，但真正要面对实战，而且还是这么重大的疫情，心里还是有点紧张的，就是不停地提醒自己要细致，不要出错。
"Although we have been through a lot of drills before, we really have to face a real battle and still have such a serious outbreak, which is a bit stressful in the heart and a constant reminder of the need to be careful not to make mistakes.
”杨雨帆说。
"said Yang Yufan.
穿着防护服不透气，在护目镜里的视线也不是很清楚、不太看得清记录表格，这些都是她们要努力克服的。
Wear protective clothing airtight, in the goggles in the line of sight is not very clear, not very clear records form, these are they have to overcome.
谈到对于工作中感染病毒的风险是否害怕，杨雨帆说：“这本来就是我们应该去承担和面对的责任，怕也没有办法去怕的。
"This is the responsibility we should take and face," Yang said, referring to whether he is afraid of the risk of contracting the virus at work.
”蒋亭安说，家人知道她要去一线，一直嘱咐她好好保护自己，“所以我肯定要练好自己的技能，做好防护。
"Jiang said that her family knew she was going to the frontline and told her to take good care of herself.
”她说，家人也理解这是她的职责，需要她去做这件事时，她就一定要去做。
"Her family understood that it was her job, and when it was up to her to do it, she had to," she said.
除了近几天担任流调的工作，前些天她俩也一直在数据组参与工作。
In addition to the transfer in recent days, they have also been involved in the data sets a few days ago.
“每天很忙，并没有时间去想太多其他的。
"I'm so busy every day that I don't have time to think about much else.
”不过，她们还是相约在执行现场任务时，都穿上了红色的衣服。
"But they were all in red on their field missions.
“我们希望能旺一点。
"We hope it will flourish.
”她俩笑着说。
'she said, smiling.
1月30日晚，执行完流调和标本运送的任务，回到长宁区疾控中心的杨雨帆（右）与蒋亭安摄影：王煜两位小姑娘说，她们的勇气和信心还来源于同事的强力支持。
January 30 evening, the completion of the task of reconciling specimens, returned to the CDC Yang Yufan (right) and Jiang Tingan photography: Wang Yu, the two young girls, said their courage and confidence also came from the strong support of colleagues.
“我们的领导、同事这些天都一直加班加点，有一位还几乎通宵连轴转。
"Our leaders and colleagues have been working overtime these days, and one of them has been working almost overnight.
她不仅坚守岗位，还给我们总结出了非常实用的流调经验。
Not only did she stick to her post, but she also developed a very practical transfer experience for us.
”她们说的那位“连轴转”的同事，是长宁疾控的余力。
The "connecting shaft" colleague they are talking about is Changning's disease-control efforts.
1月26日大年初二晚上大约10点半钟，值班的余力接到流调任务，立即赶往同仁医院。
January 26, around 10: 30 p.m., the efforts on duty was transferred to the task, immediately rushed to Tongren Hospital.
那个疑似患者是一位80多岁的老奶奶，气喘得很厉害，说一两句就要喘一会儿，对话过程比较慢。
The suspect was an 80-year-old granny who was gasping for breath. A word or two would take a little time, and the conversation was slow.
余力耐心地问完了所有问题，回到疾控中心，写完流调报告并通过审核后，已经是第二天凌晨3点多了。
After patiently asked all the questions, go back to the CDC, write the report and pass the audit, it was the next morning at 3: 00 a.m.
她抓紧眯了几个小时，天亮后的7点，她又穿上防护服、提着标本箱前往市疾控送样。
She held on tight for hours, then at 7 a. m., she put on her protective clothing and carried a specimen box to the city for disease control.
尽管如此，她还在开动脑筋，思考如何能把流调工作做得更好。
Still, she's thinking about how she can do a better job of shifting jobs.
余力平时就是中心里的“科普小达人”，有一手绘画和制作视频的“绝活”，她想到，可以试着把流调的整个流程做成小视频，分享给要去现场的伙伴们。
She thought that she could try to make a short video of the whole process of flow and share it with the people who are going to the scene.
1月28日的晚上有了想法，第二天她就和同事们一起着手做。
She had an idea for the evening of January 28th, and the next day she set to work with her colleagues.
同事去流调地点同仁医院等现场踩点，回来后绘制平面草图，余力在这个基础上加工，很快视频就传到了同事们的手机里。
Colleagues to the transfer site Tongren Hospital and other sites, after returning to draw a planar sketch, spare capacity on the basis of processing, soon the video was uploaded to colleagues in the mobile phone.
同时，余力和同事还整理出了图文版的新冠流调“宝典”——流调SOP（标准处置程序）。
At the same time, efforts and colleagues have also sorted out the text version of the new "treasure trove" - transfer SOP (standard disposal procedures).
长宁区疾控中心新冠流调小分队自制的流调流程视频截图《新民周刊》记者看到，这份“宝典”对流调的全部流程介绍非常详细，包括医院的哪个位置有怎样的设备、该走哪条通道、哪道门该怎么开，标本容器在中心的哪个位置领取，都记录得清清楚楚，所有重点内容都用突出的底色强调出来，还配上了许多图片。
The new crest flow video clip produced by the CDC's new crest unit, Xinmin Weekly, shows that the entire process of the transfer is well documented, including which part of the hospital has which equipment, which passage to take, which door to open, and where the specimen container is collected in the center.
视频则专注于流调医院病房现场的事项，加上声音和动态元素，非常实用。
The video focuses on the scene of the hospital ward, plus sound and dynamic elements, very practical.
这套图文和视频，已经成为长宁疾控流调小分队人手一份、出任务前的必学功课。
This set of pictures, text and video, has become a Changning CDC transfer team hands, before the mission must learn lessons.
“这些天最难的就是睡眠不足，平均一天只能睡三四个小时。
"The hardest part these days is not getting enough sleep, averaging three or four hours a day.
”余力说，长宁疾控的许多工作人员在今年的整个春节期间都没有一天休假。
Many workers at Changning CDC have not had a day off during the entire Spring Festival holiday this year, Liang said.
《新民周刊》记者在现场看到，长宁疾控的许多工作人员连续奋战，中心主任赵文穗、副主任蔡恩茂的办公室里都摆着一张折叠床，他们已经好几天睡在单位，没有回过家。
"Xinmin Weekly" reporters at the scene, Changning CDC many staff members have been fighting, the center director Zhao Wensui, deputy director Cai En-mao in the office of a folded bed, they have been sleeping at work for several days, did not return home.
长宁区疾控中心的工作人员为抗击疫情连续奋战摄影：王煜“这次我真正感到自己能为大众做出贡献，感受到了自己作为一名疾控人的职业意义。
Changning District CDC staff to fight against the disease continued to fight photography: Wang Yu: "This time I really feel that I can contribute to the public, feel their professional significance as a disease controller.
我们还要为抗击疫情坚持下去。
We must also persevere in the fight against the epidemic.
