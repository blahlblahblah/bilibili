整个2月，是上海第三批医疗队ICU医生团队的攻坚阶段，医生们急于寻找更好的治疗措施，提高治愈率，降低死亡率。
Throughout February, during the critical phase of the third batch of medical teams in Shanghai, doctors were eager to find better treatments to improve cure rates and reduce mortality.
记者 | 黄　祺昨天（3月16日）是上海市第三批援助湖北医疗队在武汉奋战的第50天，下午1点20分，上海医疗队负责的武汉第三医院光谷院区临时ICU病房，正式关闭。
Yesterday, at 1: 20 p.m., the temporary ICU ward in the Guanggu courtyard of Wuhan Third Hospital, run by the Shanghai Medical Team, was officially closed.
医疗队队长、瑞金医院副院长陈尔真表示，下阶段医疗队伍进入休整阶段，做好全面总结，进一步提高业务水平，等待国家的统一调配，疫情不止，战斗不息！医疗队队长陈尔真正在安排最后一批患者转运Play上海医疗队负责的武汉第三医院光谷院区临时ICU病房正式关闭十天前，武汉第三医院光谷院区一个病区已经关闭，两次“关门大吉”，预示着这家新冠肺炎定点收治医院的新冠肺炎重症患者救治工作已近尾声。
Medical team leader Chen Erzhen said that the next stage of the medical team into the rest phase, do a comprehensive summary, further improve the level of business, waiting for the country's unified deployment, the last batch of patients under the responsibility of Wuhan Third Hospital Kwanggu courtyard district has been closed 10 days ago, two "closed", heralding the end of treatment for serious cases of Newly Crown Pneumonia.
等到新冠肺炎患者全部转运到集中收治医院后，这家医院将经过彻底消毒后，恢复正常的医疗服务。
By the time the new crown pneumonia patients are transferred to a centralized hospital, the hospital will be thoroughly disinfected, normal medical services will resume.
重症医生24小时床边观察“50天，1200小时的工作对我们来说是终身难忘的。
"Fifty days, 1,200 hours of work is an unforgettable experience for us all through our lives.
”上海市第三批援助湖北医疗队队员、上海第九人民医院重症医学科应佑国医生向《新民周刊》介绍，昨天已经有13名患者转运到其他医院，今天上午，最后10名患者转运，这些患者将在同济医院光谷院区等医院继续接受治疗。
"Shanghai's third batch of medical aid to Hubei Medical Team and a member of Shanghai's Ninth People's Hospital, Dr. Youke Youguo, told Xinmin Weekly that 13 patients were transferred to other hospitals yesterday and the last 10 patients were transferred this morning and will continue treatment in hospitals such as Tongji Hospital's Guanggu courtyard.
病人转运到其他医院PlayICU关闭后，意味着医疗队ICU医生团队的工作告一段落。
The transfer of the patient to another hospital, PlayICU, meant that the work of the team of medical team doctor ICU ended.
上海市第三批援助湖北医疗队是1月28日（年初四）达到武汉的，截至3月13日累计收治重症、危重症患者107人，治愈出院5人，好转后转入院内其他病房41人，转外院5人（因需ECMO治疗及高危孕产妇），累计死亡36人（其中确诊新冠肺炎24人），新冠肺炎死亡率为22.4%。
As of March 13, a total of 107 patients with severe and critical illnesses had been admitted to Wuhan, 5 had been cured and discharged, 41 had been transferred to other wards in the hospital, 5 had been transferred to other wards in the hospital, 36 had died (24 of whom had been diagnosed with pneumonia) and 22.4 per cent had died of pneumonia.
事实上，医疗队到达武汉的第一周，由于氧气供应跟不上、治疗设备不足，造成重症患者救治成功率低，基本救治条件具备后，这个团队负责的重症患者，死亡率逐步下降，是武汉各级医院中重症患者救治效果比较好的一家医院。
In fact, during the first week of their arrival in Wuhan, the medical team was responsible for a gradual decline in the mortality rate among the seriously ill patients in Wuhan hospitals at all levels, as a result of insufficient oxygen supply and inadequate treatment equipment, resulting in a low success rate in the treatment of critically ill patients.
应佑国医生介绍，武汉第三医院ICU病房一共有医生26人，其中13人为上海医疗队的医生。
There were 26 doctors in the ICU ward of Wuhan Third Hospital, 13 of whom were doctors from the Shanghai Medical Team, Dr. Youguo said.
他们中有20位值班医生，其中10人为上海医疗队的医生，另外10人是武汉当地的医生。
Among them were 20 doctors on duty, 10 from the Shanghai medical team and 10 from Wuhan.
病房保持24小时都有医生值班，每一班医生持续工作6小时。
The ward remains open 24 hours a day, with each doctor working six hours a day.
医生对患者病情的密切观察，保证了病情有任何变化都能得到及时的救治，大大提高了治愈率。
The doctor's close observation of the patient's condition ensures that any change in the condition can be treated in time, greatly improving the cure rate.
“对ICU医生来讲，重症病人在哪，我们就在哪，ICU医生是为重症病人而生的。
"For Dr ICU, where are the seriously ill, where are we? Dr ICU is for the seriously ill.
”应佑国医生说。
'said the Doctor.
ICU病房住院患者最多的时候有三十多个病人，少的时候也有二十五六个病人，这对于在病房中值班的医生来说，是巨大的压力。
The ICU ward, with more than thirty patients in the hospital room and twenty-five or six patients in the small hours, is a great strain on the doctors on duty in the wards.
整个2月，是上海第三批医疗队ICU医生团队的攻坚阶段，医生们急于寻找更好的治疗措施，提高治愈率，降低死亡率。
Throughout February, during the critical phase of the third batch of medical teams in Shanghai, doctors were eager to find better treatments to improve cure rates and reduce mortality.
他们在一个个危重症患者的救治中，在与死神一次次的较量中，找寻突破口和诊疗路径。
They are in one of the critically ill patients in the fight with death time and time again, to find a breakthrough and diagnosis and treatment path.
头一个月摸索治疗的过程是相当艰苦的。
The first month of trial and error can be quite arduous.
“那段时间，所有的精力都用在提高治愈率上，特别累，回到酒店倒头就睡，连跟家里视频的力气都没有，我爱人发微信问我怎么‘失联’了，我就回两个字‘没空’。
"At that time, all my energy was spent on improving the cure rate. I was so tired that I went back to my hotel and slept on my head. I didn't even have the strength to video with my family.
”应佑国说。
"said Ishiba.
ICU医生团队在这段时间承受着心理和体力的双重压力，一方面医生们希望迅速降低死亡率，不断探索有效的救治方法；另一方面，穿着防护服在病房中时刻监测患者病情，体力上是巨大的考验。
The ICU team is under both mental and physical pressure as doctors try to rapidly reduce death rates and explore effective treatments. On the other hand, wearing protective clothing to monitor patients' health at all times is a huge physical test.
“以前在自己医院的重症监护室，我一个人管4个病人没问题，但在这里，穿着防护服，一直处于缺氧状态，一般最多只能同时管2名病人。
"I used to run four patients alone in the intensive care unit of my own hospital, but here, wearing protective clothing, I was in a hypoxic state, and generally could only take care of two patients at a time.
”而且，武汉第三医院的ICU是由普通病房改造的，不像大型医院ICU开放式的格局，病人住在不同的房间，医生需要不停地走动，照顾到不同房间里的病人。
Moreover, Wuhan Third Hospital's ICU has been converted by ordinary wards, unlike the open-ended structure of the ICU in a large hospital, where patients live in different rooms and doctors have to walk around constantly to take care of patients in different rooms.
来自上海各家医院的重症医学科医生组成的ICU团队经过一个月的努力，上海医疗队负责治疗的重症患者，治疗效果逐步提升。
After a month's efforts by the ICU team of doctors of severe medicine from various hospitals in Shanghai, the medical team in Shanghai was responsible for the treatment of severe cases, the treatment effect gradually improved.
应佑国介绍，后期难治的重症患者，主要是自身有多重其他疾病的老年患者，比如大面积脑梗的患者，肾功能衰竭的患者等等。
According to Yingguo, the late difficult treatment of severe patients, mainly elderly patients with multiple other diseases themselves, such as large cerebral infarction patients, kidney failure patients, and so on.
史无前例的挑战上海第三批援助湖北医疗队队长陈尔真，也是重症医学专家，因此医疗队的ICU医生团队，有着很强的专业能力，也被给予了更多期待。
Chen Erzhen, the head of Shanghai's third medical team to assist Hubei province, is also an expert in severe medicine, so the team of doctors from the medical team has strong professional competence and has been given more expectations.
应佑国医生说，作为最早到达武汉的医疗队之一，年初四出发前，只有两三天的准备时间。
As one of the first medical teams to reach Wuhan, Dr. Youke said, there was only two or three days to prepare for departure on Thursday.
虽然已经在ICU工作近二十年，救治重病患者是他的日常，但亲身参与如此大规模的烈性传染病救治，还是第一次。
Though he has worked in the ICU for nearly two decades, treating the seriously ill is his daily routine, but it is the first time he has been personally involved in treating such a large-scale epidemic.
“到武汉前，说不害怕是假的，心里还是有一定恐惧的。
"Before reaching Wuhan, to say that fear is false, there is still some fear in the heart.
”2003年非典疫情中，应佑国研究生阶段学习的一家军队系统医院，派出几位护士支援，其中几位感染。
In the 2003 SARS epidemic, an army system hospital, which was studying at the Youke graduate school, sent in several nurses to help, several of them infected.
到了武汉第三医院，应佑国医生看到的场面让他感觉“非常震撼”，病人的病情都非常的危重，危重病人的死亡率很高。
To Wuhan Third Hospital, Yingguoguo doctor to see the scene let him feel "very shocked," the patient's condition is very critical, the death rate of critically ill people is very high.
和他之前的设想不同，新冠肺炎重症患者病症不仅仅在肺部，而是全身器官的损伤。
Contrary to what he had expected, severe cases of Newcastle pneumonia were not just in the lungs, but in organ damage.
“救治的过程中可能比我们想象的更困难一些。
"The process may be a little more difficult than we thought.
”应佑国医生在病房中武汉前方的救治，得到了上海后方的全力支持。
Dr. Yingyou got full support from the Shanghai rear for the treatment in front of Wuhan in the ward.
救治中，ICU医生的自我防护也是非常重要的环节，特别是重症科医生，在进行气管插管操作时，感染风险比较高。
The ICU doctor's self-protection is also very important in the treatment, especially in the intensive care department, when the trachea intubation operation, the infection risk is higher.
应佑国医生说，2月25日ICU病房已经用上了上海第九人民医院医生发明的“一次性防飞溅隔离巾”，在床边气管插管、吸痰过程中，这个新发明能很好地避免喷溅，降低暴露性感染风险，对气溶胶能起到明显阻隔作用。
On Feb. 25, the ICU ward had been fitted with a disposable splash-proof towel invented by doctors at Shanghai's Ninth People's Hospital, a new device that can prevent spatter, reduce the risk of exposure and significantly block aerosols during intubation and sputum suction by the bedside windpipe.
武汉近2个月，重症医学科医生们的生活可能是外界难以了解的。
Wuhan nearly two months, the life of the doctors of severe medicine may be difficult to understand outside.
应佑国说，50天里的生活只有两点一线。
Life for 50 days is only a thin line, Yingguo said.
下班前洗好澡、做好消毒，乘班车或者步行到酒店，进酒店直奔自己的房间，关上门再进行消毒。
Wash and disinfect before work, take a shuttle bus or walk to the hotel, go straight to your room, close the door and disinfect.
酒店内的活动范围仅限于自己房间到餐厅，拿好饭后直接回房间单独吃饭。
The range of activities in the hotel is limited to their own room to the restaurant, after a meal directly back to the room to eat alone.
这些严格的规定，都是为了避免医护人员之间相互传染。
These strict rules are designed to avoid cross-infection among medical staff.
武汉光谷全称是武汉东湖新技术开发区，类似上海张江，是一个远离闹市区的园区。
Wuhan Guanggu is known as Wuhan Donghu New Technology Development Zone, similar to Shanghai Zhangjiang, is a downtown away from the park.
这里居民较少，但配备了一些医疗机构，成为这次疫情中征用定点医院的理想选择。
It has fewer residents, but is equipped with a number of medical institutions, the epidemic in the requisitioning of designated hospitals ideal choice.
应佑国说，酒店与武汉第三医院光谷院区之间相距一公里左右，他唯一的“放风”机会，就是步行上下班。
About a kilometer between the hotel and the Guanggu courtyard of Wuhan Third Hospital, Yingguo said his only "outdoor" opportunity was to get to and from work on foot.
在空荡荡的马路上步行一公里，对于医护人员来说是最珍贵的放松。
Walking a kilometer on an empty road is the most precious relaxation for paramedics.
