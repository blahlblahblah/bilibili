德国罗伯特·科赫研究所RKI所长威勒（Wieler）预计，德国在两三个月内确诊人数将会超过一千万。
Wieler, director of the RKI at the Robert Koch Institute in Germany, predicts that the number of people diagnosed in Germany will exceed 10 million within two or three months.
我不希望这个数字成真，德国并不像国内的社区，有居委会大妈、有网格员关心着你，给你送吃的送喝的，如果诺因基兴镇的食物断货，我也想好了，早早在院子里种了些蔬菜，自给自足。
I don't want that number to come true. Germany is not like the local community. There are neighborhood committee moms, grid workers who care about you, food and drink for you, and if the food in Noyin Kisheng is out of stock, I think I'll grow some vegetables early in the yard to feed myself.
记　者 | 吴　雪受访者 | 虞　馨在德国南部有一个名叫诺因基兴的小镇，这里人口不到1万人，距离巴伐利亚州的埃尔兰根仅20分钟车程。
AT & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45
2016年，我辞掉北京的设计师工作，带着三岁半的女儿，投奔派遣至此工作的老公，一家三口便长居于此，至今四年。
In 2016, I quit my job as a designer in Beijing and took my three-and-a-half-year-old daughter to my husband, who has been with me for four years.
3月16日，我接到了女儿学校的邮件通知，要求所有学生停课，居家作业，这个决定，让我悬着的心一下子落地了。
On March 16, I received an e-mail from my daughter's school asking all my students to stop working at home.
我一直对德国的防疫措施“提心吊胆”，学校没人戴口罩、防疫措施更没有，每次看着女儿背着书包出门，我都“如坐针毡”，“害怕感染”的担心一直持续到放学。
I have been "afraid" of German anti-epidemic measures, school no one wearing masks, vaccination measures, every time my daughter carrying a school bag, I "sit on the carpet", "fear of infection" fear continued until school.
在德国朋友口中，我听到最多的一个德语词汇是“Keine Panik”，意思是“不惊慌，别恐慌”。
One of the German words I hear most among my German friends is "Keine Panik," which means "Don't panic, don't panic."
德国街头排队抢购物资的民众3月20日，停课第4天，我拿出作业清单叮嘱女儿完成，间歇，我出门到附近的DM超市采购，手机弹出了一则新闻：这一天，德国确诊人数已经破1.2万，德国总理默克尔在电视讲话中说，新冠疫情是德国二战以来的至暗时刻。
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a televised speech that the latest outbreak was the darkest since World War II, when I took out my homework list and told my daughter to finish it.
邻居和我说话时躲在了门后每天看新闻是我多年来保持的习惯。
It has been a habit of mine for years to watch the news every day while neighbors talk to me.
一月中旬开始，中国媒体开始报道新冠肺炎，每天都有新的坏消息传来。
Starting in mid-January, Chinese media began to report new cases of pneumonia, with new bad news coming every day.
不在国内的我，除了焦虑地刷新闻，拼命劝沈阳的长辈别出门，过年不聚会，洗手戴口罩，也做不了什么。
I am not at home, in addition to anxiously brush the news, Shenyang's elders do not go out, New Year do not get together, hand-washing wearing masks, can do nothing.
当时全世界的中国人都在各国掘地三尺地找口罩、防护服、护目镜，往中国寄。
Chinese people all over the world dug up three feet of ground to find masks, protective clothing, goggles and send them to China.
德国华人也不例外，当时我联络了当地的超市采购了多批口罩，可以证实的是，德国的口罩和防护服基本被中国人买空了，甚至因为物资紧俏，谈好的价格往往第二天都不作数，也是常事。
Chinese Germans were no exception. I contacted local supermarkets and purchased batches of face masks. It was confirmed that German masks and protective clothing were largely bought by the Chinese. Even when supplies were tight, it was not unusual to negotiate good prices the next day.
但捐赠物资的事情，我没跟多久，因为家里出了意外状况。
But I didn't follow up on the donation for long, because something happened to my family.
1月2日，我们一家三口驱车去捷克滑雪，在滑雪场，老公突发视野扭曲，后到埃尔兰根眼科急诊检查，确诊为视网膜脱落，急需手术。
On January 2, our family of three went skiing in the Czech Republic. At the ski resort, my husband had a distorted field of vision and went to Erlangen for an emergency ophthalmologic examination.
而在老公住院期间，奶奶病逝。
While her husband was in hospital, Grandma died.
分身乏术的我，再没有多余精力跟到底了。
I have no spare energy to follow me to the end.
虞馨老公在埃尔兰根就诊的眼科医院　受访者供图德国第一例确诊病例，正是出现在我们居住的巴伐利亚州，当时德国新闻上并无详细报道，直到1月27日，我们才知道病人的一点情况。
The first confirmed case in Germany came from the interviewee of the ophthalmological hospital of Erlangen. It was in Bavaria, where we lived, that the German press did not give any details until January 27.
患者男性，33岁，Webasto公司员工，因为和一位来自中国分公司的女同事共同参加培训而感染。
The patient, a 33-year-old employee of Webasto, was infected after attending a training session with a female colleague from a Chinese subsidiary.
很快，Webasto（德国一家汽车零配件品牌）宣布关闭总部大楼，所有员工居家办公，同时德国卫生部门扩大检测范围，检测更多的员工和他们的家人，近200人进行两周的居家隔离。
Soon Webasto (a German car parts brand) announced the closure of the headquarters building, with all employees working from home, while German health authorities expanded testing to include more employees and their families, and nearly 200 people spent two weeks in residential isolation.
客观来说，控制得还不错，没有出现“猪队友”，数据上看，把Webasto公司摁住了之后，德国也没有新的增长。
Objectively, the control was good, there was no "pig teammate" and, statistically speaking, there was no new growth in Germany after Webasto was pinned down.
2月12日，Webasto总部重新开门，门口还打出大大的“欢迎回来”标语，一切如常。
On Feb. 12, Webasto's headquarters reopened, and a big "Welcome Back" sign was posted at the door, as usual.
那时候，德国民众并不知道病毒的可怕，他们认为这个病毒离自己还很遥远。
At that time, the German people did not know the virus is terrible, they think the virus is still far from themselves.
明显的分水岭是在2月23日的狂欢节。
The defining watershed was the Carnival on February 23.
狂欢节假期前两天，意大利有暴发的趋势，我开始感觉不对劲了。
Two days before the Carnival holiday, there was an outbreak in Italy, and I began to feel something was wrong.
狂欢节第二天早上，我马上预见性地在亚马逊下单了防疫物资，50个一包的口罩，已经从原先的10欧元涨到了40欧元；诺因基兴镇DM超市的消毒液、喷剂、纸巾还很齐全，当时我只拿了两三瓶。
Immediately after Carnival morning, I presciently ordered a vaccination kit for Amazon. The 50-pack mask was raised from Euro10 to Euro40; I had only two or three bottles of antiseptics, sprays, and tissue paper for the DM supermarket in Noyingchen.
最开始在DM买了一车消毒用品，后来就买不到了　受访者供图果然，我的判断是对的，北威州的Heinsberg（海因斯贝格县）最早确诊了一例参加狂欢节的夫妻，直接导致Heinsberg及周边一千多人被隔离。
I was right. Heinsberg (Heinsberg County) was the first to identify a husband and wife who attended the carnival, leading directly to the isolation of Heinsberg and more than a thousand people around him.
紧接着2月28日，德国确诊人数从53例，一下子增长到了600多例，短短两三周新增患者覆盖全德达到5300多人。
On February 28, the number of people diagnosed in Germany jumped from 53 to more than 600, adding more than 5,300 patients in just two or three weeks.
那个周五，我再去超市采购，所有的米类、意大利面、罐头、消毒用品货架全部空了。
That Friday, I went back to the supermarket to shop. All the rice, pasta, cans and disinfectant shelves were empty.
与抢购物资正相反，我身边的德国朋友普遍都很淡定，他们认为这就是一个比较严重的流感，跟感冒一样，会治愈的。
In contrast to the rush, German friends around me are generally quiet, believing that this is a more serious flu that can be cured just like a cold.
一位嫁给德国人的朋友向我吐槽，老公和公公每天给她“洗脑”：要求她出门不要戴口罩，会被别人认为是病人；更不要去囤货，这完全没必要。
A friend married to a German spat on me, and my husband and father-in-law "brainwashed" her every day: asking her not to wear a mask outside the house would be seen as a patient, not to mention hoarding, which was completely unnecessary.
为此家里还爆发了“辩论大战”。
A "big debate" broke out in the family.
他们还说，就算不幸被感染上了，那也是上帝的选择，不如听天由命、随遇而安。
They added that even if unfortunate enough to be infected, it is God's choice, rather than resigned to the fate of the situation.
第二次去时，超市纸制品货架抢购一空　受访者供图但你说德国人真的一点都不怕吗？事实证明并不是，我有一个朋友住的房子是一梯两户，之前有一个快递被邻居代收，回来之后，我找对方拿快递，敲了很久的门，对方都没开门，过了几分钟，我家的门铃响了，邻居猫着门缝露出半个脸说：你的快递我给你放门口了，然后迅速转身回家，把门关起来了。
It turned out that I had a friend living in a two-staircase house, and I had a courier who had been picked up by a neighbor, who knocked on the door for a long time. After a few minutes, the doorbell rang and my neighbor opened the door for you.
我个人认为，德国人还是有些恐慌的，恐慌的根本还在于他们对于新冠肺炎的认知不到位。
Personally, I think the Germans are a bit panicky, and the bottom line of the panic is that they don't know enough about the new crown pneumonia.
去医院看诊时，没人戴口罩对于病毒的正确认知，也许不仅是德国民众不知道，德国政客、德国医生也不知道。
When visiting a hospital, no one wears a mask, and the correct perception of the virus may be unknown not only to the German public, but also to German politicians and German doctors.
德国新闻在报道新冠疫情时，大多是一句话带过：新增多少，死亡多少。
German news coverage of the new crown was mostly one sentence: How much new, how many dead.
很少有一些详细的描述，只有数字，作为观众，确实难对病毒有具象的认识。
There are few detailed descriptions of just numbers, and as viewers, it is really difficult to have a meaningful understanding of the virus.
德国压根也没有宣传过一些防疫知识，新闻报道最多的就是没必要戴口罩，勤洗手是最有效的预防方法，这么说的背后，其实是德国已经没有足够的口罩供应人手一份了。
Germany did not even promote some knowledge of vaccination, the most news is no need to wear masks, washing hands is the most effective way to prevent, behind the statement, Germany has no enough supply of face masks.
按照德国卫生部部长的说法，让民众太过了解这个病毒，容易引发恐慌，所以最好不知道。
According to the German Health Minister, it is easy to panic by making people too aware of the virus, so it's better not to know.
但我认为了解这个病毒，不就是在提醒人们，躲开握手礼、大型聚会、人流密集活动等高危时刻吗？收治新冠病人的医院ErlangerHautklinik　受访者供图事实比我想象的还糟糕。
But I don't think understanding the virus is a reminder that people should avoid high-risk moments such as handshake, large gatherings, crowd-intensive activities? Erlanger Hautklinik, a hospital for newly-crowned patients, is worse than I thought.
1月13日，老公出院，此后一直居家办公。
On 13 January, my husband was discharged from hospital and has been working from home ever since.
不久后，我们去埃尔兰根大学医院复查，这里刚刚有一个皮肤科的医生在参加慕尼黑研讨会时被确诊。
Not long after, we went to Ellangen University Hospital, where a dermatologist had just been diagnosed while attending a Munich seminar.
这位医生隔离的综合楼，距离我老公就诊的眼科，仅相隔一个大花园的距离。
The doctor's secluded compound was only a big garden away from my husband's ophthalmology.
我们当时很担心，备了口罩和消毒液前往，在医院入口处发现有消毒液供应，但医院门诊没有一个人戴口罩，包括医生、护士。
We were worried, wearing masks and disinfectant, and found disinfectant supplies at the entrance to the hospital, but none of the patients at the hospital clinic wore masks, including doctors or nurses.
之前在群里和华人聊，也看到过网上因为华人戴口罩遭遇歧视的新闻，内心万般纠结。
Chatting with Chinese in the group before, I have also seen the news of discrimination against Chinese wearing masks on the Internet.
到底戴还是不戴？戴了，怕被别人说成“异类”；不戴，又怕被传染。
Wear it or not? Wearing it, for fear of being called "alien" by others; not wearing it, and afraid of infection.
几番思想斗争，直到看诊结束，口罩一直被我揣在兜里，没好意思拿出来戴上。
Several ideological struggles, until the end of the consultation, the mask has been put in my pocket, do not want to put it on.
现在回头想想，真是一次冒险的经历。
In retrospect, it was an adventure.
不过，这两天，医院似乎有了新变化。
However, over the past two days, the hospital seems to have changed.
德国的警察、消防、医护人员们在各地手举标语拍照，上面写着“我们为你们留在这里，请你们也为我们留在家里！　受访者供图因为身体原因，我去了附近的诊所，之前这家诊所，口罩没有一个人戴。
German police, firefighters and paramedics held banners around the country, saying "We stay here for you, please stay home for us.Interviewee: Because of my health, I went to a nearby clinic, where none of the masks were worn before.
但去了之后，发现所有的医生、护士全部戴上了口罩，患者没有戴，但在分诊的前台，递上医保卡后，会自觉站在1米远的位置等候。
But after the visit, all the doctors and nurses put on masks, the patients did not wear, but in the front desk, after the delivery of a medical care card, will consciously stand at a distance of 1 meters waiting.
这是我来德国四年第一次在诊所看到他们戴口罩。
This is the first time I've seen them wearing masks in a clinic in four years.
那天，我很安心地戴上了口罩，就诊的医生还夸我：没看出来，你的眼睛还挺大。
That day, I put on a mask with peace of mind, the doctor also praised me: did not see, your eyes are quite big.
截至此时，德国政府的核心疾控机构RKI将新冠威胁评级定为“温和”。
By this time, the German government's core disease control agency, RKI, rated the new crown threat as "moderate."
联邦政府并未有任何具体、强制的防控措施，只是号召大家少出门，如果有人发热，还是按照原来就诊的流程，联系你的家庭医生，做检查后，分流轻重症病人，轻症和密切接触者居家隔离，重症送到医院治疗。
The Federal Government does not have any specific, mandatory control measures, but simply calls on everyone to leave home less often. If someone has a fever, contact your family doctor in accordance with the original procedure, and after a check-up, shunt light-weight patients, light illnesses and close contacts in their homes and send them to hospitals for treatment.
我有一个朋友，在看望儿子回来后，确诊新冠肺炎，目前就是居家隔离。
A friend of mine, who came back from a visit to her son, confirmed pneumonia in the new crown.
图片来源｜路透社我也明白，每个国家的国情不同，防疫方法也不同，但至少在已确知的病毒知识上，公众有权力知晓必要的防疫知识，比如“病毒在不同表面存活的时间”“借鉴了哪些防控手段”德国政府多少该给民众一个心理准备，“我们很可能也会有这么一天”。
2007-2-1 00: 00 I know that each country has its own national conditions and epidemic prevention methods, but at least the public has the right to know the necessary epidemic prevention knowledge, such as "how long the virus survives on different surfaces.
但很遗憾并没有，我们只能在自己的可控范围内，做好防护。
But unfortunately not, we can only in their own controllable range, good protection.
最近能不出门就不出门了，即便出门，口罩手套也都会戴上，进出门都会自觉消毒。
Recently can not go out on the outside, even if out, mask gloves will wear, will be self-disinfecting.
以前和朋友经常去的一家面包房，这个时期的生意甚至比平时还要好。
At a bakery frequented by friends, business was even better this time than usual.
那家面包房的服务员从不用夹子拿面包，更没人戴口罩和手套，我身边的华人妈妈们果断决定再也不去了。
The baker never took bread out of his wallet, and no one wore masks or gloves. The Chinese mothers around me decided not to go any more.
停课停工，回国不是明智的选择女儿在停课之前，我每天都非常担心，她上小学二年级，一个班级24个人，出门前，会嘱咐她千万别拿手揉眼睛，没事就喷些酒精在手上，如果学校没有备酒精，就用自己的。
I was very worried every day before the class was suspended. She was in the second grade of elementary school and had a class of 24. Before she left, she was told never to rub her eyes, spray some alcohol on her hands when she was not in school.
因为是女孩子，还会听话地照着实施，同班的男孩子就不好说了，洗手、喷酒精一般比较难。
Because it is a girl, but also obedient to follow the implementation, the class of boys are difficult to say, hand-washing, general alcohol spray is more difficult.
最让我心惊胆战的一次是，埃尔兰根的一所学校，有一个学生确诊新冠肺炎，学校当天就关闭停课了，而恰巧我女儿同桌的哥哥姐姐全在那所学校上课，感染源的圈子一下缩小了，我一整天都心神不宁，还好，那天同桌被要求居家隔离，没去上学。
One of my scariest experiences was when a student at a school in Erlangen diagnosed pneumonia shut down school the same day, just as my daughter's brother and sister at the table were attending the school, and the circle of sources of infection shrank.
Ｈeinsberg一家幼儿园4个孩子确诊，该地区所有幼儿园和学校都已关闭　图｜dw.de实际上，巴伐利亚州的政府从上周就开始讨论“要不要停课”，默克尔考虑到经济的影响，是不同意停工停学的。
All kindergartens and schools in the area have been closed, as confirmed by four children at an Heinsberg kindergarten. In fact, the Bavarian government has been discussing the possibility of a class cutoff since last week.
但3月12日，德国的“钟南山”Christian Drosten博士改变他以往的观点并支持学校停课是个转折。
But on March 12, Dr Christian Drosten, of Germany's "Zhong Nan Shan," changed his views and supported school closures as a turning point.
巴伐利亚州的州长也很有决断性，决定从3月16日，也就是周一开始，全州停学不停课三周，高年级上网课，低年级发邮件布置作业。
The governor of Bavaria, also decisive, decided to suspend school for three weeks starting Monday, March 16, with advanced Internet classes and low-grade e-mail assignments.
妈妈群得知这个消息时，像过年一样，大家纷纷写道：终于停课了。
When their mother learned this news, like the Chinese New Year, everyone wrote: Finally, class was suspended.
孩子们放假了，爸爸妈妈也只能在家办公，老公所在的自动化公司，除了个别工厂必须在岗，建议有孩子的居家办公，没孩子的随个人意愿。
The children are on holiday, parents can only work from home, the husband's automation company, in addition to the individual factory must be on duty, the proposal has children at home, no children as the individual wishes.
德国没有父辈带娃的习惯，双职工的德国妈妈们，比较麻烦，托班关闭了，公益机构在开，但只针对医生、消防、警察等特殊群体，她们曾想过邻居之间互助一下，一替一天轮换着在家带娃，但这实施起来并不容易。
Germany does not have the habit of parents, dual-career German mothers, more troublesome, Toban closed, the public interest institutions open, but only for doctors, fire, police, and other special groups, who have thought about mutual help between neighbors, day after day rotation, but this is not easy to implement.
从周一开始到复活节假期结束，所有学校停课关门　受访者供图我们在德国没有别的亲人，又不可能随便雇个保姆带娃，这个小家庭运转的前提是，一定要保证我们两个人都不生病，否则就只能把孩子送到福利机构，我不敢往下想。
From Monday until the end of the Easter holidays, all schools were closed. Respondents had no other relatives in Germany, and no babysitting was possible. The premise of this small family was to make sure neither of us got sick or we had to send our children to welfare institutions.
有许多华人朋友请了探亲假回国，说实话，我和老公也想过“要不要回国”的问题，但商讨下来发现，这并不是一个明智的选择。
To be honest, my husband and I also thought about whether or not to go back to China. However, after discussing it, it was not a wise choice.
首先，德国政府认为接受教育是孩子的基本义务，作为家长不能阻止孩子接受教育，因此，出海关相对困难；其次，就算能过海关，一路上感染的风险也很大，到了之后，何时回来又是一个问题，万一荒废了上学、耽误了工作，也不划算；最后，德国回国的单程机票已经涨到了3万元/张，来回一家三口要花费至少18万元，更是承担不起。
First of all, the German government regards education as a basic obligation for children. As parents cannot prevent their children from receiving an education, it is relatively difficult to get out of customs. Second, even if they can go through customs, the risk of infection along the way is high.
不如就安心待在这里，配合当地的防疫政策。
Better stay here and cooperate with the local vaccination policy.
德国街头开始有人戴起了口罩我们所在的巴伐利亚州算反应迅速的，率先宣布灾难事件，启动了灾难保护模式。
German streets began to see people wearing masks Our state of Bavaria was quick to announce a disaster and activate its disaster protection model.
所有医护医学院学生准备，警察国防军消防员后备役约45万随时待命。
All medical school students are ready, and the PFDJ Fireman Reserve Service is approximately 450,000 on call.
医院腾病床，再新添1000台呼吸机，虽然德国的医疗资源储备已经是欧洲最好。
With hospital beds and 1,000 new ventilators, Germany already has one of the best medical reserves in Europe.
3月17日，开始关闭大众娱乐场所，餐馆可以营业，但就餐间距必须1.5米，而且整个餐馆不得超过30人；3月18日，开始关闭商场，生活超市改为每天都营业，包括周日开到晚上10点；药店、卫生用品超市、银行、加油站照常营业。
On 17 March, mass entertainment establishments were closed. Restaurants were allowed to operate at intervals of 1.5 metres and not more than 30 persons; on 18 March, the mall was closed and the daily operations of the supermarket began, including Sundays until 10 p.m.; pharmacies, hygiene stores, banks and petrol stations remained open.
巴伐利亚州还准备了100亿欧元准备金，扶持因为灾难受到损失的企业。
Bavaria also has a €10 billion reserve to support businesses that have suffered losses as a result of the disaster.
但并不是所有的州都是这样。
But this is not true of all states.
比如，北威州没有停学，仍然正常上课；柏林从3月18日（周三）才开始停工停学，公共场所还是该干什么干什么。
North Wales, for example, is not suspended from school and is still functioning normally; Berlin was suspended from school on Wednesday, March 18, and public places still have to do something about it.
有人在社交媒体上分享的图片，天气好的时候，慕尼黑市中心的公园，挤满了晒太阳的人，附近的冰激淋店甚至比往常的客流还要多。
Pictures were shared on social media, parks in downtown Munich were crowded with sunbathers, and nearby ice cream parlours were even more popular than usual.
德国总理默克尔发表电视讲话　图｜法新社德国人心太大了，默克尔急了。
German Chancellor Angela Merkel televised her speech: The German public is too popular, Merkel is impatient.
3月19日，她在15年任职内首次就特殊情况发表全国电视讲话，她说，最难的是，我们所有人都不能碰面，而这本来是理所当然的。
On 19 March, in her first national television address on an exceptional situation in her 15-year tenure, she said that the hardest part was that we all could not meet, which was a matter of course.
她还表示，虽然德国医疗体系完善，但如果在短时间内收治太多重症患者，医院将不堪重负。
She added that while the German health-care system was well developed, hospitals would be overwhelmed if they treated too many seriously ill patients in a short period of time.
目前尚无针对该病毒的疗法或疫苗。
There is currently no treatment or vaccine against the virus.
的确，德国对疫情的防控能力暴露了很多该国治理体系的弊病。
Indeed, Germany's ability to control the epidemic has exposed many of the flaws in the country's governance system.
截至当地时间20日23时许，德国累计确诊感染新冠肺炎人数已突破1.9万。
By 2300 local time on the 20th, the cumulative number of people diagnosed with pneumonia in Germany has exceeded 19,000.
鉴于此，巴伐利亚州和萨尔州当天宣布实施限制公民出行自由的宵禁令。
In view of this, Bavaria and Saarland announced the same day imposed a curfew restrictions on the freedom of movement of citizens.
规定从3月21日0时起至4月3日24时止，居民除因采购必需品、就医、上下班等必要事由外一概不得外出；如果不是一个人外出，则只允许和家人同行。
From 0000 hours on 21 March to 2400 hours on 3 April, residents are not allowed to go out except for necessities such as the purchase of necessities, medical treatment, commuting, etc., or to travel with their families if they are not alone.
同时，该州所有的餐厅和啤酒花园在此期间必须关闭，仅允许外送服务。
Meanwhile, all canteens and beer gardens in the state had to be closed during the period, allowing only for delivery.
德国终究要靠德国人来拯救，疫情周期会持续半年？一年？甚至更长？我不知道，也没人知道，就像薛定谔的猫，无从知晓。
Germany will ultimately have to be rescued by the Germans, the cycle of the outbreak will last for half a year? A year? Even longer? I don't know, and no one knows, just like Schrodinger's cat.
作为一名华人，我每天的生活，没有太多变化，女儿的德语我辅导不了，只能靠她自觉。
As a Chinese, my daily life, not much change, my daughter's German I can not help, can only rely on her awareness.
至于“停课三周之后，会不会复学”，“如果持续延长，低年级的老师，会不会也开始直播网课了”，这个谁也说不准。
As for "three weeks after the suspension, will it be possible to resume school", "if the extension, the lower grade teachers, will also start to live the network classes," which is not clear.
12月底圣诞节，虞馨带女儿去慕尼黑美术馆看画展　受访者供图德国罗伯特·科赫研究所RKI所长威勒（Wieler）预计，德国在两三个月内确诊人数将会超过一千万。
At the end of December, the carnation takes its daughter to the Munich Art Gallery to see the interviewees at the exhibition. Wieler, director of RKI at the Robert Koch Institute in Germany, predicts that the number of confirmed cases in Germany will exceed 10 million in two or three months.
我不希望这个数字成真，德国并不像国内的社区，有居委会大妈、有网格员关心着你，给你送吃的送喝的，如果诺因基兴镇的食物断货，我也想好了，早早在院子里种了些蔬菜，自给自足。
I don't want that number to come true. Germany is not like the local community. There are neighborhood committee moms, grid workers who care about you, food and drink for you, and if the food in Noyin Kisheng is out of stock, I think I'll grow some vegetables early in the yard to feed myself.
我们无法做到像德国人一样心大，但至少，得有足够的心理准备，熬过这个未知的艰难时期。
We can't be as big as the Germans, but at least we have to be mentally prepared to survive this unknown period.
