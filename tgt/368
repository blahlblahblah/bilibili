本报记者 张家振 武汉报道“今天核酸检测结果阳性，尘埃落定，终于确诊了。
Our reporter Zhang JiaZhen Wuhan reported that "today the nucleic acid test results are positive, the dust settled, finally confirmed.
”2月1日上午10时41分，疫情“吹哨人”李文亮对外界宣布了这一消息。
At 10: 41 a.m. on February 1, Li Wenliang, the epidemic's "whistle blower," told the outside world the news.
李文亮是武汉市中心医院的一名眼科医生，因最早于2019年12月30日向外界发出防护预警，而被称为疫情“吹哨人”。
Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital, was called the "whistle-blower" of the outbreak because he gave a warning of protection as early as December 30, 2019.
2月1日下午，李文亮在接受《中国经营报》记者采访时表示，已经答应家人安心养病，暂不接受媒体采访。
On the afternoon of February 1, Li Wenliang told the China Business Daily that he had promised his family that he would stay in good health and not talk to the media.
目前其正在武汉市中心医院接受隔离治疗。
It is currently undergoing isolation treatment at Wuhan Central Hospital.
此前一天的1月31日，北京感恩公益基金会拨付“守护者后盾行动”项目成立以来的第一笔10万元“特别贡献支持”款项，受益人正是李文亮。
On January 31, 2008, the Beijing Gifts Foundation allocated its first $100,000 "Special Contribution Support" to the Guardian's Support Initiative, benefiting Lee.
据该基金会负责人周健介绍，款项主要用于资助在本次抗击疫情中有突出贡献的人员，“他的行为客观上让更多人对病毒有了提前的防范”。
Zhou Jian, director of the foundation, said the money was used to fund people who made a significant contribution to the fight against the epidemic. "His actions objectively enabled more people to pre-empt the virus.
（武汉市中心医院医生李文亮）善意的防护提醒武汉市中心医院后湖院区，是距离华南海鲜市场最近的三甲医院，直线距离不超过1.5公里。
(Doctor Li Wenliang, Wuhan Central Hospital) The well-intentioned defense reminds Wuhan Central Hospital Houhu District, which is the closest Sanjia hospital to the South China Seafood Market, with a direct distance of no more than 1.5 kilometers.
在最早一批感染新型冠状病毒肺炎的商户患者中，大多在周边诊所及社区医院治疗未见好转后，前来武汉市中心医院后湖院区就诊，这也让包括李文亮在内的医生最早接触患者、获得相关诊断信息。
Most of the first commercial patients infected with the new coronavirus pneumonia came to the backlake courtyard of Wuhan Central Hospital after treatment did not improve. This also enabled doctors, including Li Wenliang, to have the earliest contact with the patient and obtain relevant diagnostic information.
早在2019年12月31日下午，记者曾来到武汉市中心医院后湖院区探访，多位医务人员向记者证实，昨天（12月30日）夜里确实收治过几位疑似肺炎病人。
As early as the afternoon of December 31, 2019, the reporter had come to Wuhan Central Hospital Houhu District visit, a number of medical staff confirmed to reporters that yesterday (December 30) did treat several suspected pneumonia patients.
最初是在门诊一楼的急诊外科病房，已经转到二楼了。
Initially in the emergency surgical ward on the first floor of the outpatient clinic, it was transferred to the second floor.
记者当时在一楼看到，急诊外科病房已大门紧闭，门上贴有“此门不通”的告示。
The reporter saw on the first floor that the emergency surgical ward had been closed with a sign on the door saying "This door is closed."

摄影/本报记者 张家振）据李文亮回忆，2019年12月30日下午5点多，他在武汉大学临床04级班级群里发布消息说“华南海鲜市场确诊了7例SARS”，提醒同为临床医生的同学“让家人亲人注意防范”。
According to Li Wenliang, a reporter for the newspaper, Li Wenliang recalled that on December 30, 2019, at 5pm, he announced in his class group of class No. 04 at Wuhan University that "seven cases of SARS have been confirmed in the South China seafood market.
李文亮也由此成为最早向外界发出防护预警的人之一。
As a result, Li Wenliang was one of the first to issue protective warnings to the outside world.
为了证明自己所言不虚，李文亮还在群里发出了一份写有“检出高置信度阳性指标 SARS冠状病毒阳性”的临床病原体筛查结果和患者胸部CT。
To prove his case, Li Wenliang also sent out a clinical pathogen screening test and a CT scan of the patient's chest with the words: "Detect high-confidence positive indicator SARS coronavirus positive."
一个小时后，他在群里补充称：“最新消息是冠状病毒感染确定了，正在进行病毒分型。
An hour later, he added in the group: "The latest news is that the coronavirus infection has been confirmed and the virus is being typed.
”同一天，武汉市卫健委印发的《关于做好不明原因肺炎救治工作的紧急通知》开始流传，肺炎疫情首次进入公众视野。
On the same day, the Wuhan Health Commission issued the Emergency Notice on Treating Unknown Causes of Pneumonia, which entered the public eye for the first time.
该通知特别强调“未经授权任何单位，个人不得擅自对外发布救治信息”。
The circular stresses, inter alia, that "individuals shall not, without authorization, release treatment information to any other entity."
在向同学发出善意的防护提醒后，李文亮的工作、生活一切如常。
In the students issued a well-intentioned protection reminder, Li Wenliang's work and life as usual.
身为眼科医生的他，在接诊、治疗一位82岁的急性闭角型青光眼患者过程中，因大意没有做防护而暴露在了病毒之下。
As an ophthalmologist, he was exposed to the virus while receiving and treating an 82-year-old acute angle-closure glaucoma patient without protection.
据李文亮描述，1月8日左右自己收治的眼疾患者体温正常，只是食欲不佳，并没有呈现出新冠肺炎常见的发热症状。
According to Li Wenliang, on or about January 8, his treatment of an eye disease with normal body temperature, only poor appetite, did not show the new crown pneumonia common fever symptoms.
第二天患者还是食欲不好，中午发热了，查肺部CT提示是“病毒性肺炎”，其他的各项指标都符合不明原因肺炎的标准。
The next day the patient or appetite is bad, fever at noon, check lung CT indication is "viral pneumonia," all other indicators meet the criteria for unknown causes of pneumonia.
1月10日、11日，李文亮出现咳嗽、发热等症状；12日因发烧、肺部感染住进隔离病房，成为疑似病例，但一直未获确诊。
January 10, 11, LI Wenliang cough, fever and other symptoms; 12 days because of fever, lung infection into the isolation ward, a suspected case, but has not been confirmed.
此后，李文亮因病情加重转至武汉市中心医院呼吸内科重症监护室接受治疗。
Li Wenliang was transferred to the intensive care unit of the respiratory department of Wuhan Central Hospital for treatment due to his serious illness.
据了解，李文亮目前呼吸困难，插着氧气管，不能起床、说话，通过打字与别人交流，“每天都要打抗生素、抗病毒，球蛋白和吸氧。
Li Wenliang is currently breathing difficulties, inserted oxygen trachea, can not get up, talk, through typing and other communication, "every day to hit antibiotics, antiviral, globulin and oxygen absorption.
”“敢于说出事情真相的人”李文亮，籍贯辽宁省锦州市北镇市，今年34岁。
"Dare to tell the truth," Li Wenliang, 34, from Beizhen, Jinzhou, Liaoning Province.
2004 年李文亮参加高考并报考武汉大学临床医学七年制专业，在厦门短暂工作3年后，重返武汉在武汉市中心医院工作至今，顺理成章地开启了留在武汉工作、生活的历程。
In 2004, Li Wenliang took part in the college entrance examination and signed up for the seven-year course of clinical medicine in Wuhan University. After three years of working briefly in Xiamen, he returned to Wuhan to work in Wuhan Central Hospital.
“我的妻子是其他医院的眼科医生，孩子才5岁。
"My wife is an ophthalmologist at another hospital and the child is only five years old.
现在妻子带着孩子在丈母娘家生活。
The wife now lives with her children in-laws.
”李文亮在接受媒体采访时表示，现在每天都和爱人微信聊天、视频，他们也会给我加油鼓励。
In an interview with the media, Li Wenliang said he now talks to his loved ones through microphone and video every day, and they cheer me up.
收治的眼科病人在诊断出现“双肺磨玻璃样病变”，属于病毒性肺炎后，照顾她的家属和女儿也先后出现了发热症状。
Ophthalmologic patients in the diagnosis of "two-lung grinding glass-like lesions", belong to viral pneumonia, care for her family and daughter have had fever symptoms.
这让李文亮更加确信“明显存在人传人”，不过，此时的他因隔离治疗或其他原因，并没有继续向外界传达预警信息。
This strengthened Li's conviction that there was "a clear human-to-human transmission," but he did not continue to deliver early warning messages to the outside world, either through seclusion or for other reasons.
据李文亮在接受《财新》采访时介绍，这是明显的人传人。
According to Li Wenliang in an interview with Caixin, this is a clear person-to-person transmission.
我们就立刻上报到医务处和院感办公室了，请了院内专家组会诊，会诊后建议患者在我科隔离治疗。
We immediately reported to the medical service and hospital office, invited the hospital expert consultation, after the consultation recommended the patient in my seclusion treatment.
三天后，我们又给他做了复查 CT，结果还是“病毒性肺炎”，而且范围扩大，病情加重了，接着患者就转到呼吸内科隔离病房，之后的情况我就不知道了。
Three days later, we gave him a second CT scan and it was "viral pneumonia," which was enlarged and made worse, and then the patient was transferred to the respiratory isolation ward, and I don't know.
而在李文亮出现发热等不适后，其同科室的同事在之后的一两天也出现了感染情况，父母在三四天后也相继出现了发热等症状，肺部CT呈现磨玻璃样病变而住院治疗。
However, after Li Wenliang had a fever, his colleagues in the same department also had infection in the next day or two, and his parents had fever after three or four days, and the CT of the lung appeared to grind glass-like lesions and was hospitalized.
据李文亮介绍，他们正在武汉其他医院接受治疗，现在都挺好的，没有大碍，应该近期就可以出院。
According to Li Wenliang, they are being treated in Wuhan other hospitals, now quite good, no major problems, should be able to leave the hospital in the near future.
根据武汉市卫健委1月11日通报，对外口径仍为“目前未发现医务人员感染，未发现明确的人传人证据”。
According to Wuhan Health Commission reported on the 11 January, the external calibre is still "no medical staff found infection, no clear evidence of human-to-human."
“那时候我还在想通报怎么还在说没有人传人，没有医护感染。
"At the time I was wondering why it was still being said that there was no human-to-human transmission and no medical attention to infection.
”李文亮表示。
"said Mr Li.
直到1月20日晚间，中国工程院院士、国家呼吸系统疾病临床医学研究中心主任钟南山首度向外界表示，新型冠状病毒肺炎肯定存在人传人的现象，并向外披露了“14个医务人员感染”的事实。
Zhong Nan-shan, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and director of the National Clinical Research Centre for Respiratory Disease, told reporters for the first time that human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus pneumonia was inevitable and revealed the fact that 14 medical staff were infected.
李文亮的事迹也受到了北京感恩公益基金会等公益组织的关注。
Li Wenliang's deeds have also received attention from public welfare organizations such as the Beijing Gratitude Public Welfare Foundation.
1月31日21点，该基金会“守护者后盾行动”项目向李文亮拨付第一笔10万元“特别贡献支持”款项。
On January 31, at 21: 00, the foundation's "Guardian's backing" project allocated the first $100,000 "special contribution support" to Li Wenliang.
支持理由是：他是一个对工作负责的、真实而敢于说出事情真相的人。
The reason for this is that he is a responsible, honest person who dares to tell the truth.
他的行为客观上让更多人对病毒有了提前的防范。
His behavior objectively allows more people to pre-empt the virus.
据周健介绍，截至2月1日21:00，“守护者后盾行动”项目组工作人员及志愿者正在与22名初步符合资助条件的受助对象本人或家属进行联系，其中包括特殊贡献医生3人、医护人员8人、警察和辅警9人和基层干部2人。
As of 21: 00 pm on Feb. 1, Project Manager and volunteers are in contact with 22 initial eligible clients, including 3 doctors with special contributions, 8 medical personnel, 9 police and auxiliary police officers and 2 grass-roots cadres, according to Zhou.
“他们很多都曾是奋战在抗击疫情第一线的英雄，有的已经献出了宝贵的生命，有的已经不幸感染，有的仍在一线奋战。
"Many of them have been frontline heroes in the fight against the epidemic, some have lost their precious lives, some have been infected tragically, others are still fighting on the frontlines.
”“守护者后盾行动”项目组表示，为所有因公参加2020年抗击“新型肺炎”工作人员（包括不限于医务人员、检疫人员、检查人员、媒体记者等）在救援中致病、致残甚至不幸殉职，提供无偿的人道援助，项目资助内容包括生活补助、治疗支持、教育支持、特别抚恤、赡养支持和特殊贡献支持等。

“我一定积极配合治疗，争取早日出院。
"I will actively cooperate with the treatment, strive for early discharge.
”李文亮表示，康复后我想赶快回到一线工作，继续为患者看病。
'I want to get back to the front line and continue to see the patients, 'he said.
