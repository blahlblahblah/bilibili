船上人们的焦虑也与日俱增。
Anxiety was growing on the ship.
艾丽告诉新京报记者，“我们觉得自己不是在被隔离，而是等待着被感染。
"We don't feel isolated, we're waiting to be infected," she told the Beijing News.

全文6300字，阅读约需12.5分钟1月25日，大年初一，43岁的香港人黄雅曦一家七口抵达香港启德邮轮码头，准备乘坐当晚11时59分出发的“钻石公主号”邮轮，在海上庆祝新年。
On January 25, the 43-year-old Hong Kong family of seven people arrived at Hong Kong's Kai Tak Cruise Terminal for the New Year's Eve celebration aboard the MV Princess Diamond at 11: 59 pm.

After a one-day stopover and disembarkation of some passengers, the vessel continued its journey to Danang, Vietnam, Hanoi, Keelung, Okinawa, Japan, before finally returning to Yokohama on February 4 for a total of 15 days and 16 nights.
一位邮轮工作人员告诉新京报记者，香港一向是客流量较大的中转地，从日本出发前往东南亚的邮轮都会在此停留，很多本地人会在这里上下船；香港机场又是国际机场，很多员工也会在这里轮换。
Hong Kong has always been a tourist destination, a Beijing News official told the Beijing News. Cruises from Japan to Southeast Asia stop there, where many locals will disembark; Hong Kong airport is also an international airport where many employees rotate.

An 80-year-old Hong Kong passenger was admitted to Hong Kong with fever on January 30 and was confirmed to be newly infected when he disembarked and returned home on the same day.

由网友 @data_tw提供━━━━━邮轮启航：渐渐放松警惕1月25日上午10时30分，邮轮开始办理登船手续。
By netizen @ data _ tw Departure of Cruise Gradually Relaxing Vigilance At 10: 30 am on January 25, the liner began boarding.
等待时间颇长，黄雅曦注意到，排队人群中，自己是少有的戴口罩的乘客。
Waiting for a long time, Huang noticed that she was one of the few passengers in the queue wearing a mask.
此前，香港陆续爆出的5宗新冠肺炎确诊案例让她提高了警惕。
She had been alerted by five confirmed cases of pneumonia in Hong Kong.
登船前，她为家人备足了船上用的口罩和消毒洗手液。
Before boarding the boat, she provided her family with surgical masks and disinfectant hand sanitizers.
下午两点，黄雅曦一家终于登上了邮轮。
At two o'clock in the afternoon, the HuangYaXi family finally boarded the cruise.
他们订了11层的三间内舱房，原本还担心没有新鲜空气，但疫情暴发后，她却不禁庆幸，“我们房间没有窗口，都是密封的。
They booked three 11-storey cabins and feared no fresh air, but after the outbreak, she said, "Our rooms have no windows, they're sealed.
”香港人劳允若（化名）和家人、朋友们订了11层的7间房。
Hong Kong residents agreed to book seven rooms on the 11th floor with family and friends.
他们一行14人，由来自香港、澳门的六个家庭组成。
The 14-member group is made up of six families from Hong Kong and Macao.
因团队中有不少老年人，劳允若也在出发前提醒大家戴口罩，“香港新闻一直在报道肺炎疫情，提醒市民出门要戴口罩，我们知道很严重。
"Hong Kong News has been reporting on the pneumonia epidemic and alerting the public to wear face masks. We know it is serious," said Mr Lau, who was among the elderly on the team.
”就在黄雅曦、劳允若登船的当天下午，香港行政长官林郑月娥在记者会上宣布，疫情对本地社群健康风险“高而迫切”，应变级别由当时的“严重”，提升至最高的“紧急”级别。
Speaking at a press conference on the afternoon of Wong Yat-sei's arrival, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, Mrs Carrie Lam, announced at a press conference that the health risks to the local community were "high and urgent."
然而，上船后，劳允若发现，船上大多是外国人，戴口罩的人很少，“慢慢我们也松懈了，只在到了越南等地上岸时才戴。
However, when he got on board, Laoyun found that most of the ships were filled with foreigners and few people wore masks. "We relaxed slowly and only wore them when we got ashore in places like Vietnam.
”黄雅曦却依然警惕，“我们尽量不在人多时去餐厅吃饭，只要去人员密集的地方都要戴口罩。
"We try not to eat in a crowded restaurant and wear masks whenever we go to crowded places," Huang said.
”钻石公主号的日常管理让黄雅曦放心，“船公司让我们遵守规则，吃饭前一定要洗手消毒才可以进食。
"Wong was reassured by the daily management of the Princess." The shipping company made us obey the rules and had to wash our hands and disinfect before eating.
从上船开始就非常严格。
It was very strict from the start of the ship.
”最初的邮轮生活和想象中一样愉快。
The first cruise life was as pleasant as imagined.
黄雅曦一家人没有在每个港口都下船游览，“船上的项目多到玩不过来，我们一家喜欢做健康运动，白天会一起上健身班，一起游泳，晚上看节目。
The HuangYaXi family did not get off the ship in every port, "the ship's items can not play enough to play, our family like to do healthy exercise, daytime will go to gym class, swimming, evening programmes.
”“钻石公主号”上娱乐项目极其丰富。
"The Princess of Diamonds" has plenty of entertainment.
据其官网介绍：您可以在Kai寿司 (特色餐厅) 品尝新鲜制作的生鱼片，驻足富丽堂皇的中庭广场观看街头表演，或是去往公主剧院欣赏一场气势恢宏的演出。
You can sample freshly made sashimi at Kai Sushi, stop at the magnificent atrium square to watch a street performance, or go to the Princess Theatre to see a magnificent performance.
海上大型日式汤浴，也将为您呈献出类拔萃的精致服务。
Sea large-scale Japanese soup bath, will also be presented to you outstanding exquisite service.
而劳允若则坚持在每个港口都下去游览一番，“在岘港，我们14个人租了一辆中巴游览景点；到了有‘海上桂林’之称的下龙湾，我们租了个小船；在基隆，我们有人去了台北101，有人去了台北故宫博物院。
"In Danang, 14 of us rented a China-Brazil scenic spot, in Xialong Bay, which is called Guilin Sea, we hired a boat. In Keelung, we had people go to Taipei 101 and people to the Palace Museum in Taipei.
”他们此时尚不知道，1月30日，“钻石公主号”从河内出发前往基隆的这段时间里，曾在1月25日下船的80岁男性香港乘客开始发烧，同日到香港明爱医院急症室求医，并入院接受隔离治疗。
They did not know at the time that the 80-year-old male Hong Kong passenger who had disembarked on 25 January developed a fever during the trip from Hanoi to Keelung on January 30 and sought medical treatment in the Accident and Emergency Department of Caritas Hong Kong Hospital on the same day for isolation.

受访者供图━━━━━航行途中：来了个“坏消息”在返航前的最后一站日本冲绳，劳允若发觉，海关检查变得繁琐起来。

2月1日下午1时，“钻石公主号”抵达冲绳。
At 1 p.m. on 1 February, the Princess Diamond arrived in Okinawa.
劳允若回忆，入境前需要领取两张宣传单，上面是有关新型冠状病毒的详细资料。
If you recall, you will need two leaflets with details of the new coronavirus before entering Hong Kong.
选择下船入境的乘客还会收到一张询问单，内容包括是否去过湖北、武汉，是否有发烧或其他症状等，海关人员也会逐个对乘客当面进行询问。
Passengers who choose to disembark will also receive an enquiry form, including whether they have been to Hubei and Wuhan and whether they have fever or other symptoms. Customs officers will also conduct personal interviews with passengers.
而在此之前的其他港口，劳允若说，“我们只要提前填好健康申报表，出去连同电子签证出示给海关人员，很快就办好了。
Earlier, Laoyun said, "All we have to do is fill out the health declaration forms in advance and show them to Customs officers with our e-visas.
”当时，新冠肺炎疫情已经在全球蔓延开来。
The outbreak was already spreading around the world.
共有来自亚洲、北美洲、欧洲、大洋洲和南美洲的23个国家报告了确诊病例。
A total of 23 countries from Asia, North America, Europe, Oceania and South America reported confirmed cases.
截至1月31日，日本也已确诊17例新冠肺炎。
As of January 31, 17 cases of New Crown Pneumonia had been confirmed in Japan.
由于手续繁琐，整个下船入境的过程持续了约5个小时，劳允若直到下午6点才真正入境，晚上10点多又要回船，“等待的时间比玩的时间还长。
Due to the cumbersome procedures, the entire disembarkation process lasted about five hours. If Laoyun did not enter the country until 6 p.m. and would return at 10 p.m., "the waiting time was longer than the time spent playing.
”当晚，劳允若和黄雅曦不约而同地注意到了一条来自家乡香港的新闻，一位80岁香港男性确诊了新冠肺炎，而他曾经和自己乘坐过同一航次的“钻石公主号”邮轮。
That night, Laoyun and Huang noticed a news report from Hong Kong, where an 80-year-old Hong Kong man had confirmed pneumonia after travelling the same voyage as himself, the Princess Diamond.
据香港特区政府新闻公报，卫生署卫生防护中心正调查一宗新增新型冠状病毒感染确诊个案。
The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is investigating a confirmed case of a new coronavirus infection.
该名80岁男病人居于新界葵涌邨绿葵楼，过往健康良好。
The 80-year-old man lives in Green Kwai House in Kwai Chung Tsuen, New Territories.
他于潜伏期内没有到医疗机构、湿街市或海鲜市场，亦没有接触野生动物。
During his incubation period, he did not visit medical institutions, wet markets or seafood markets, nor was he in contact with wild animals.
公报中提到了该病人的详细行程，“他于1月10日经罗湖口岸到内地逗留数小时，于1月17日乘飞机由香港前往日本东京，自1月19日起出现咳嗽，1月20日于横滨上船乘坐邮轮，1月25日抵达香港启德邮轮码头，1月30日开始发烧，同日到明爱医院急症室求医，并入院接受隔离治疗。

病人已转送玛嘉烈医院接受进一步治疗，目前情况稳定。
The patient was referred to Princess Margaret Hospital for further treatment and is now in stable condition.
”看到新闻后，劳允若第一时间和同行其他人讨论，但“当时以为他下船了就没事了。
"Seeing the news, Lou agreed to discuss it with the rest of the group immediately, but" I thought he was all right when he got off the boat.
”黄雅曦的反应更为激烈一些。
Huang's reaction was more intense.
她立刻回到房间戴上口罩，并找到船上服务人员一问究竟。
She immediately went back to her room to put on a mask and went to the ship's attendants to ask.
黄雅曦回忆，工作人员告诉她，香港政府已经知会船方，船方会将发烧或自称有感冒症状的人士全部隔离，如果有进一步消息会及时通知。
Wong recalled staff telling her the Hong Kong government had informed the ship that it would isolate anyone with a fever or claiming to have flu symptoms, and would keep them informed if there was any further information.
船员艾丽（化名）告诉新京报记者，2月2日一早，在每日部门例会上，菲律宾籍主管告诉大家，“有个坏消息，可能出现了新的病毒。
Crew Ally (not her real name) told the Beijing News that in the early morning hours of February 2, at a daily departmental meeting, the Philippine chief told everyone, "There's bad news. There may be a new virus.
”并强调当天“要进行彻底的消毒。
"And stressed that the day" to carry out a thorough disinfection.
”但这一消息并未立即通知给全体乘客。
But the news was not immediately made available to all passengers.
2月2日一整天，邮轮在海面航行，“每晚6、7点，七楼一间室内影厅内会有歌舞表演，一般会有一两百人观看，当天晚上照常进行。
"Every night at 6 or 7 o'clock, there will be a singing and dancing performance in an indoor theatre on the seventh floor, usually watched by one or two hundred people, as usual.
”劳允若说。
"said Louisier.
从看到新闻起，黄雅曦全家一直戴着口罩，但船上大多数人仍然没戴口罩。
The whole family had been wearing masks since the news, but most of the people on board were still wearing masks.
直到2月3日下午4点左右，船方才第一次向全体乘客通报了疫情。
It was not until about 4 p.m. on 3 February that the ship first informed all passengers of the outbreak.
劳允若记得，当时船长在广播中表示，“香港有个肺炎案例，是在下船后几天确诊的，我们现在正在加速，务求晚上8:30可以提前抵达横滨港口，所有乘客要接受日本政府的健康审查，工作人员将上船对每一位乘客进行体温测量及抽样检查。
If you recall, the captain said on the radio that "there was a case of pneumonia in Hong Kong which was diagnosed a few days after disembarkation. We are speeding up our efforts to reach Yokohama harbour ahead of schedule at 8: 30 pm.

If you remember, the staff of the local Health Bureau were wearing protective clothing, masks, gloves and boarded the ship to take the temperature of each person. They were asked if they had any fever, runny nose or cough.
2月4日凌晨4时半，已接受完体温检测回房睡觉的黄雅曦一家三口再次被叫醒，日方检疫人员拿来棉签，采集了三人的咽拭子样本。
At 4: 30 a.m. on February 4, the family, who had returned to their rooms after a temperature check, were woken up again. Japanese quarantine officials brought cotton swabs and took samples of three people's swabs.

"During the trip, my husband had cold symptoms and went to the ship's medical center to see the ship's doctor, so Japan got his information," Huang explained.

The collection and testing of samples took time, and on 4 February, at daybreak, passengers on board received a radio announcement that the quarantine was still in progress and that all passengers had to wait on board for another day.
这天吃早饭的时候，劳允若注意到，邮轮上开始进行全方位认真消毒，在公共区域，一旦有人离开座位，清洁人员就会过去用消毒液擦拭。
At breakfast on that day, Laoyun noticed that thorough disinfection had begun on board the vessel and that once someone had left his seat in the public area, the cleaner would come and wipe it with disinfectant.

However, she also understood the director somewhat: "Foreigners have little contact with the outbreak and take it very lightly.
