编者按：这是武汉三个场景下除夕夜的故事。
Editor's Note: This is the story of New Year's Eve in Wuhan.
透过他们，我们看见武汉的局部细节，看见平凡市民们的焦虑，疲惫，坚强和希望。
Through them, we can see the local details of Wuhan, ordinary citizens to see anxiety, fatigue, strong and hope.
新的一年已经到来，愿武汉与我们在春天相见。
The new year has come. May Wuhan meet us in the spring.

“到底患了什么病？”。
What is the matter with it?
大年三十的这天傍晚，罗家敏送走儿子后，门外的声控灯很快便灭了。
On the evening of the New Year's Eve, after Luo Ka-min saw off his son, the sound control light outside the door quickly went out.
楼道复归昏暗，门内寂静无声。
The hallway was dark and the door was silent.
。
.
今天已注定无法团圆。
Today is doomed to be a reunion.
10天以来，持续且不明原因的低烧、乏力迫使她无法长时间下床活动。
For 10 days, a persistent and unexplained low fever and fatigue prevented her from getting out of bed for long periods of time.
她也没什么事做，得病的消息很快传开，除了偶有探望的儿子，这间位于武汉市江岸区百步亭的经济适用房罕有访客。
The news of her illness spread quickly. Except for her occasional visiting son, the affordable home at 100 steps in the riverfront area of Wuhan was rarely visited.
她全天都戴着口罩，与老伴分房睡，彼此也常常无话可说。
She wore masks all day, slept separately from her wife, and often had nothing to say to each other.
。
.
就像这里很多反复回忆自己经历的人们一样，罗家敏每天也在复盘她到底在哪里染了病。
Like so many people here who recall their experiences over and over again, Luo Jia-min resumes every day where she got sick.
1个月前，她的老伴因骨折被送入武汉市中心医院后湖院区后，她不得不每天往返奔波。
A month ago, she had to commute to and fro every day after her wife was sent to the backlake courtyard of Wuhan city's central hospital for a fracture.
罗家敏猜测“在这个途中，很有可能是在医院电梯里感染上的。
Luo Jiamin conjectures "on this journey, very likely is in the hospital elevator infection.
”。
"
她的老伴对此也深以为然。
Her old wife was taken aback by this.
他们觉得，这并不重要。
They felt that this was not important.
重要的是：罗家敏到底患了什么病？。
The important thing is: What's wrong with Luo Jia-min?
最初的病状出现在2020年1月14日的早上——2天前，老伴做完更换人工关节的手术后出院回家。
The initial symptoms appeared on the morning of January 14, 2020 - two days after his wife was discharged from surgery to replace her artificial joint.
她感到四肢无力，持续发烧。
She felt limp and feverish.
症状使她以为自己患上了感冒，但经过5天的社区医院诊疗后，她的情况依旧没有得到改善。
Symptoms led her to think she had a cold, but her condition did not improve after five days of community hospital treatment.
。
.
19日的晚上，罗家敏在儿子的陪同下来到武汉市中心医院后湖院区。
On the evening of the 19th, Luo Jiamin accompanied by his son came down to Wuhan central hospital back lake courtyard area.
这天夜里，后湖院区人满为患，直到次日凌晨1点，她才坐到了内科急诊室的医生对面。
Later that night, the backlake courtyard was overcrowded until 1: 00 a.m. the next day, she sat in the emergency room of internal medicine opposite the doctor.
。
.
罗家敏素爱写诗，她说康复后想继续写。
Luo Jiamin loves to write poems. She says she wants to continue writing after she recovers.

Interface reporter Liu Haichuan.
她做完CT已是早上6点。
It's six o'clock in the morning since she finished her CT scan.
病历上没有呈现她的诊断结果，CT诊断报告显示她双肺多发感染。
Her diagnosis was not presented in the medical record, and a CT diagnosis revealed multiple infections of both lungs.
医生给她挂了利巴韦林的点滴，并叮嘱她每天服用三次酚麻美敏片（泰诺）和两次奥司他韦，它们通常被用于缓解流感和普通感冒的症状。
The doctor gave her a drip of ribavirin and told her to take phenolamine (Tylenol) three times a day and oseltamivir twice a day, which were commonly used to relieve symptoms of influenza and the common cold.
医生叮嘱她回家休养后，再没有说什么。
When the doctor told her to go home and recuperate, she said nothing more.
。
.
这似乎没有效果。
This does not seem to work.
1月22日，儿子再次从武昌赶到汉口，将她送到汉口医院就诊。
On 22 January, her son again travelled from Wuchang to Hankou and took her to Hankou Hospital.
待他们赶到医院，“我感到绝望。
"When they got to the hospital," I felt desperate.
”罗家敏回忆，她看见偌大的候诊厅里，已经排了500多人的队伍。
Luo recalled seeing a queue of more than 500 people in the huge waiting room.
这一次，罗家敏放弃了诊治。
This time, Luo Ka-min gave up diagnosis and treatment.
“身体排不了队，又怕交叉感染。
"Not in line, afraid of cross-infection.
”。
"
她又回到了百步亭社区医院。
She returned to the Bumpting Community Hospital.
通常情况下，老伴会在每天早上9点，驾驶老年代步车将她送到目的地注射利巴韦林。
Usually, my wife would drive her to her destination every morning at 9: 00 am in an elderly walker to inject Ribavirin.
。
.
她一般会在下午1点返回家中，服用医生开的药片。
She usually returns home at 1 p.m. to take the pills prescribed by her doctor.
烧已经退了，但总会在夜里1点发作。
The fire's gone, but it always hits 1: 00 in the night.
她说，早上去社区医院就诊的时候，“必须是发烧的状态，否则医院就不会给我打针了。
When I went to the community hospital in the morning, she said, 'I had to have a fever, or the hospital wouldn't have given me an injection.
”。
"
持续的乏力和反复的发烧使她疲于应对，“已经没有多少坚持下去的欲望了。
Persistent fatigue and repeated fevers had left her struggling. "There was not much desire to persevere."
”罗家敏说，这病从内部慢慢地掏空了她。
'said Luo, slowly emptying her of the disease from within.
。

超市里顾客稀疏。
There are few customers in the supermarket.

老伴没有戴口罩，坐在沙发上盯着妻子看。
The old man sat on the sofa without a mask and stared at his wife.
对于这一切，他无能为力。
There was nothing he could do about it.
这对老夫妇是土生土长的武汉人，“对江城的感情血浓于水”。
This old couple is born in Wuhan, "the feelings of Jiangcheng thicker than water."
两人1990年代遭遇下岗，他们曾常年在汉口赵家条摆夜宵摊。
The two men were laid off in the 1990s. They used to set up a midnight snack stand in Zhaojiajiao in Hankou.
“一生中的几个大事，都在武汉度过。
"" Several important events of my life were spent in Wuhan.
”。
"
同样无能为力的还有社区居委会。
Equally powerless are community neighbourhood committees.
罗家敏曾向他们求助，支部书记便每天给她打电话询问病情，再无他法。
Luo Ka-min had asked them for help, and the branch secretary called her every day to inquire about her condition.
“但这有什么用呢？”。
"But what's the use?"
他们几乎不接收来自外界的信息。
They receive very little information from outside sources.
自从罗家敏生病后，家里的电视没有再打开过。
The TV at home has not been turned on since Luo Ka-min became ill.
她也几乎从不看手机上关于这场新型冠状病毒肺炎的相关信息。
She hardly ever looked at the phone for information about the new coronavirus pneumonia.
。
.
儿子住在武昌的杨园，两家隔江相望，但他也不是每天都来。
His son lives in Yangyuan, Wuchang, two families across the river, but he does not come every day.
罗家敏说，以前儿子的工作忙，逢年过节才回来看看父母，“现在病了，倒是见得多了。
Mr. Luo says his son, who used to be busy with his work, came back to see his parents at the end of the year.
”。
"
对于母亲的命运，儿子也无能为力。
There was nothing his son could do about his mother's fate.
“他带我去看病，也劝我在家隔离治疗。
"He took me to the doctor and advised me to stay home for treatment.
”。
"
罗家敏干咳了几声，从下巴处掀开防尘口罩，喝了口保温杯里的水。
Luo Jiamin coughed a few times, from the chin to lift the dust mask, drank the water in the thermos cup.
“我知道大家都尽力了，可我就想知道，我到底得了什么病。
"I know everyone tried their best, but I just wanted to know what the hell was wrong with me.
”。
"
这个除夕夜里，两人不到9点便各自睡去。
On New Year's Eve they both went to bed before nine o'clock.
像这些天的每个夜晚一样，罗家敏身体困乏，但彻夜难眠。
Like every night of these days, Luo Jia-min is tired and sleepless at night.

发热医生的除夕。
The fever doctor's New Year's Eve.
徐明煮了一碗速冻水饺，端给了妻子叶柔。
Xu Ming cooked a bowl of frozen dumplings and handed them to his wife, Yeruo.
她勉强吃了几个，放下了碗。
She reluctantly ate a few and put down the bowl.
在这个四口之家的饭桌上，仅有前两天剩下的半碗菜薹。
At the table of the family of four, there were only half a bowl of bolts left over from the previous two days.
。
.
家里现在只有速冻水饺。
There are only frozen dumplings at home.
武汉封城以后，多家超市的方便面和速冻食品的货架被人们扫购一空。
The shelves of instant noodles and frozen food in many supermarkets were snapped up after Wuhan was closed.
。
.
在新型冠状病毒感染肺炎爆发前，叶柔夫妇本来已为这个春节做了周全的安排，并且提前想好了年夜饭的菜单。
Before the outbreak of the new coronavirus pneumonia, Mr. and Mrs. Ye had already made well-thought-out arrangements for the Spring Festival and planned the menu ahead of time.
但一切都已经改变。
But that has changed.
。
.
有了解他家情况的邻居，送来一包蔬菜和水果。
A neighbor who knew about his family brought a bag of vegetables and fruit.
徐明从门口拿进来，放在地上。
Xu Ming brought it in from the door and laid it on the ground.
门上的对联和福字，是徐明除夕下午贴上的，成了这一家和春节的唯一关联。
The couplet on the door was affixed on the afternoon of Xu Ming New Year's Eve and became the only connection between the family and the Spring Festival.
贴完之后，他拍照发了条朋友圈：“再难也要过年。
After the posting, he took a photo and sent a circle of friends: "No matter how difficult New Year is.
”。
"
徐明夫妇年夜饭桌上仅剩半碗菜薹。
Mr. and Mrs. Xu Ming have only half bowl of bolts left.

身为武汉市一家三甲医院医生的叶柔，介绍着饭桌上几种药的功效：“你要想预防感冒的话，可以吃点莲花清瘟胶囊。
Ye Ruo, a doctor at a three-A hospital in Wuhan, describes the benefits of several medicines on the table: "If you want to prevent a cold, you can eat a lotus rinderpest capsule.
阿比多尔片是治上呼吸道感染的，莫西沙星片也是抗菌的。
Abidol tablets are used to treat upper respiratory tract infections, and moxifloxacin tablets are also antimicrobial.
”。
"
就在武汉封城两日前的晚上，徐明出现畏寒症状。
Just two nights before the city was closed in Wuhan, Xu Ming developed chilly symptoms.
到了23日，叶柔夫妻几乎同时发烧，“他37.5度，我38度。
On the 23rd Ye and his wife had a fever almost simultaneously. "He was 37.5 degrees and I was 38 degrees.
”。
"
发烧并不表示一定与新型冠状病毒肺炎关联，但足以让他们产生焦虑。
Fever is not necessarily associated with the new coronavirus pneumonia, but it is enough to cause anxiety.
。
.
23日下午，叶柔前往自己就职的医院检查身体。
On the afternoon of May 23, Yeroy went to the hospital where he worked to check on his health.
她本在休产假。
She was on maternity leave.
“做了血常规和甲、乙流感检查，还拍了肺部CT。
"I had routine blood tests and tests for influenza A and B, and CT scans of the lungs.
流感检查和CT都正常，但血常规显示有感染。
Flu tests and CT were normal, but routine blood tests showed infection.
”叶柔说：“我担心我也得了肺炎，可能还是早期，所以CT检查时正常的。
"I'm afraid I've got pneumonia, too, maybe early, so it's normal for a CT scan," Ye said.
”。
"
“我们医院只有发热门诊，当时人太多了，队都排到了楼外面，我怕交叉感染，就没敢过去。
"Our hospital only had a fever clinic, when there were too many people, the team has been lined up outside the building, I am afraid cross-infection, do not dare to cross.
”叶柔说，同事为叶柔开了些药，建议她在家隔离观察，因为医院目前床位也非常紧张。
"Ye said her colleagues prescribed some medicine for Ye and advised her to stay home and observe it, as the hospital bed was also very tight.
。
.
作为医生，她对自己的身体敏感并有经验，“以前我感冒都是先有流鼻涕、喉咙疼这种症状，这次主要症状是心慌气短、持续低烧、双下肢无力，和以前的感冒发烧完全不一样。
As a doctor, she was sensitive and experienced with her body. "I used to have a runny nose and a sore throat, and this time the main symptoms were shortness of breath, persistent low fever, weakness of the lower limbs, and a fever quite different from the previous cold.
”。
"
徐明回忆，他曾在1月14日坐高铁前往北京出差，1月16日返回武汉，“当时一般人根本不重视这个事情，在高铁上我也没有戴口罩。
Xu recalled travelling to Beijing on a high-speed train on January 14 and returning to Wuhan on January 16. "People didn't attach any importance to this at the time, and I didn't wear a mask on the high-speed rail," Xu recalled.
”叶柔分析，高铁上空气不好，人员又比较密集，那趟出差有可能让丈夫感染病毒。
Ye said the air on the high-speed rail was bad and the staff was dense, and that trip could expose the husband to the virus.
。
.
叶柔说，更早前的1月9日，当武汉出现的不明原因的肺炎被定位新型冠状病毒肺炎时，“我们医生圈当时就推断，这个病毒的传染性和致病力不比SARS弱。
Earlier, on January 9, when the unexplained pneumonia in Wuhan was located in the new coronavirus pneumonia, "our doctors' circle inferred at the time that the virus was no less infectious and pathogenic than SARS.
”她便买了些N95和9132型口罩，“但是没有买很多，当时觉得疫情很快会被控制住。
"She bought some N95 and 9132 masks." But she didn't buy many, and I thought the outbreak would soon be under control.
”。
"
同时，叶柔也提醒丈夫徐明，要他出门戴口罩，但徐明并不以为然：“身边的朋友同事大多跟我一样，没太当回事。
At the same time, Ye reminded her husband Xu Ming that he should go out wearing a mask, but Xu did not take it seriously: "Most of my friends and colleagues around me are like me.
”直至1月19日，武汉市卫健委一次性通报了新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎病例198例的信息，徐明这才开始重视。
Only on January 19 did Xu Ming attach importance to the one-off notification by the Wuhan Health Commission of 198 cases of pneumonia infected with the new coronavirus.
。
.
23日凌晨，武汉市官方宣布将于当日10时起封城。
Early Sunday morning, Wuhan city officials announced that the city will be closed from 10: 00.
徐明在手机上看到消息后，连忙去小区附近的便利店买了些速冻水饺，“那家店比较小，也就只有速冻水饺这种吃的。
Xu Ming saw the news on his mobile phone and rushed to the convenience store near the neighborhood to buy some frozen dumplings.
”。
"
“其实我都不担心自己，主要是担心她和两个孩子。
"I wasn't really worried about myself, I was worried about her and my two children.
”徐明说：“女儿不到3岁，儿子才4个月，她产后身体又虚弱，抵抗力差。
"Her daughter is under three years old and her son is only four months old. She is weak and has a poor resistance after giving birth," Xu said.
”。
"
数家超市里泡面和速冻食品都已售罄。
Several supermarkets have sold out of noodles and frozen food.

他们也曾后悔。
They also regretted it.
“本来我们想在22号的时候回长沙过年，但是转头一想，孩子还小，回去的路上太折腾，而且专家也呼吁武汉人尽量不要离开武汉，所以我们就留下了，没想到……”。
"We wanted to go back to Changsha for the Spring Festival on the 22nd, but turned to think that the children are still small, the road back to toss, and experts also called on Wuhan people to try not to leave Wuhan, so we stayed, did not expect......"
到了24日，徐明的体温恢复正常，而叶柔却丝毫不见好转。
On the 24th, Xu Ming's body temperature returned to normal, but Ye did not get any better.
“从今天下午开始，我就一直觉得心慌、胸闷、乏力，小腿肌肉无力，不摸的话小腿好像都不存在一样。
"Since this afternoon, I have been feeling restless, chest tightness, fatigue, weak calf muscles, if not touch the calves do not seem to exist.
”叶柔向记者描述着她的症状：“我现在在这坐着，都一身冷汗。
Ye described her symptoms to reporters: "I'm sitting here in a cold sweat.
”。
"
吃完饺子，叶柔决定要连夜去自己供职的医院住院治疗。
After eating dumplings, Ye decided to spend the night in hospital where he worked.
她向徐明交代，在家应该怎样消毒，怎样照看两个孩子。
She told Xu Ming how she should disinfect her home and look after her two children.
。
.
她给同事打了电话，描述自己的症状，并询问是否有空的床位。
She called her co-workers to describe her symptoms and ask if there were any beds available.
几分钟后，她在发热门诊的一位同事回了电话，又详细询问了叶柔的症状。
A few minutes later, one of her colleagues at the fever clinic called back and asked in detail about Ye's symptoms.
。
.
这位同事告诉叶柔，她可能只是感冒发烧而已，而且就算是感染了新型冠状病毒，目前最好的办法也是在家隔离观察。
The co-worker told her she might just have a cold and fever, and even if she was infected with the new coronavirus, the best way to do so would be to watch from home.
即便现在到医院，也难以很快确诊是否感染新型冠状病毒。
Even now to the hospital, it is difficult to quickly determine whether the new coronavirus infection.
“医院不是定点医院，病患样本需送至武汉市疾控中心检验，出结果需要三天时间。
"The hospital is not an on-site hospital. The patient samples need to be sent to Wuhan CDC for testing.
现在住院也只能是隔离观察，床位紧张、医疗物资紧缺不说，还可能要面临交叉感染的风险。
Hospitalization is now restricted to isolated observation, tight beds, medical supplies, not to mention the risk of cross-infection.
”叶柔转述。
"he said.
。
.
接完电话，叶柔的心态似乎平和了许多，“我好像放松些了，现在也只能这样了，去医院真的还不如在家呆着。
After the phone call, Ye soft state of mind seems to be much more peaceful, "I seem to relax a little, now can only do so, the hospital is really better to stay at home.
”。
"
在这个除夕夜，只有他们不到3岁的女儿，独自跑动蹦跳，脸上挂着笑容——她还不明白眼下的境况意味着什么。
On New Year's Eve, with only their 3-year-old daughter hopping alone and smiling, she had no idea what the situation meant.
。
.
电视是开着的，但播放的并不是春晚。
The TV was on, but it wasn't the Spring Festival Gala.
夫妻俩播放了一部动画片，希望它能吸引女儿的注意力，从而减少些大人的负担。
The couple played an animated film in the hope that it would attract their daughter's attention and thus reduce the burden on adults.
。
.
“如果我俩都病倒了隔离了，这俩孩子怎么办？”不得已，徐明联系了身在长春的大姐。
"If we are both sick and isolated, what will happen to the two kids?" Xu Ming contacted his elder sister in Changchun as a last resort.
24日下午4点50分，徐明大姐从长春飞至郑州，后又乘高铁到达孝感。
24: 50 p.m., Xu Ming big sister flew from Changchun to Zhengzhou, and then arrived filial piety on the high-speed train.
由于公共交通停运，大姐如何进入武汉，让徐明焦虑不已。
Because public transportation is out of commission, how does elder sister enter Wuhan, let Xu Ming worry ceaselessly.
他一整天都在四处联系，希望能有人能送姐姐到武汉。
He kept in touch with each other all day, hoping that someone would see his sister off to Wuhan.
。
.
最终，有好心人表示可以去武汉城边的检查点附近，接坐网约车从孝感过来的徐明大姐进城。
In the end, a kind-hearted person said that you can go to Wuhan city near the checkpoint, from the sense of filial piety by Xu Ming big sister into the city.
。
.
25日除夕夜的凌晨两点多，姐姐终于抵达徐明的家中。
On New Year's Eve, more than two in the morning, my sister finally arrived in Xu Ming's home.

如果叶柔的身体没有大碍，再过十来天，产假结束后，她也将投身一线。
If Ye's body is OK, in another ten days, after the maternity leave, she will join the front line.
“我们医院正在建实验室，很快便有检测新型冠状病毒的能力，可能也要成为定点医院。
"Our hospital is building a laboratory and will soon be able to test for a new coronavirus, possibly a designated hospital," he said.

Peng recalled that, since the outbreak, several families have given up treatment because of the cost of treatment.
他透露，ECMO疗法治疗成本通常是十几万元。
ECMO treatments typically cost hundreds of thousands of yuan, he said.
近期一例重症患者家庭条件不佳，“他的亲属把亲朋好友都借遍了，当时就说，就是砸锅卖铁也要救回来。

为了抵御来自隔离病房的任何危险，李静和同事们在进入前要穿上三层防护：手术服、头套、手套、鞋套组成的第一层防护；白色的医用防护服；医用口罩、护目镜、面屏组成了面部防护层。
To guard against any danger from the isolation ward, Ms. Li and her colleagues put on three layers of protection before entering: a surgical uniform, a hood, gloves, and shoes; white medical protective clothing; and a medical mask, goggles, and face screen to form a face protection layer.
。
.
这样一套衣服，需要30分钟的穿戴时间。
It takes 30 minutes to put on such a suit.
且在穿着上防护服后，医护人员的行动将受极大的限制，“比如走路不能迈大步子，还不能喝水，不能如厕。
After wearing protective clothing, medical staff will be severely restricted in their movements, such as walking without walking, drinking water or using the toilet.
因此需要每4个小时就要走出隔离病房，休息一次。
So you need to get out of the isolation ward every four hours and take a break.
”。
"
但特殊时期，4个小时都是奢望。
But in special times, four hours is too much to hope for.
彭志勇说，疫情爆发后，同事们甚至要穿着防护服连续工作16小时。
Colleagues even had to wear protective clothing for 16 hours after the outbreak, Pang said.
。
.
就在李静坚守一线的同时，同为医护人员的父亲、姑姑亦在抗击疫情的第一线。
While Li Jing clung to the front line, her father and aunt, both medical workers, were also in the front line of the fight against the epidemic.
“家里面只有哥哥陪着母亲。
"There is only my brother at home with my mother.
1岁多的宝宝和老公也在家里等着。
Babies and husbands over the age of 1 are also waiting at home.
”。
"
“今天过年，早上还和妈妈通过视频电话。
"We had a Chinese New Year this morning and a video phone call with my mom.
她教我如何包饺子，怕我包不会。
She taught me how to make dumplings for fear that I wouldn't.
”。
"
她将在除夕夜的凌晨1点下班回家，“回去就要包饺子。
She will come home from work at 1: 00 a.m. on New Year's Eve.
”。
"
这个夜晚，护士付行在护士站里接到了一个电话：家属给患者拜年，请她转达。
This evening, the nurse paid a phone call to the nurse station asking her family to call the patient for the New Year.
。
.
对方在电话里说：“妈，你好好加油，等你康复了，你女儿、孙子在家等你回去过年。
The caller said, "Mom, cheer up and when you get well, your daughter and grandson will be at home waiting for you to return for the New Year.
”。
"
她进入隔离病房，送去远处的祝福。
She went into the isolation ward to send her blessings in the distance.
一些护士被替换出来。
Some nurses were replaced.
进出的人们都年轻，精力旺盛，疲惫不堪。
The people coming and going were young, energetic and tired.
他们所处的江城武汉，和中国的任何地方一样，进入除夕的子夜。
Their city Wuhan, like any other part of China, entered the midnight of New Year's Eve.
