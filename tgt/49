“我倒是不很担心自己，就有点担心做得不够好、或者给团队拖后腿，毕竟经验有限。
"I'm not worried about myself, I'm a little worried about not doing it well enough, or delaying the team, because I have limited experience.
”全文2216字，阅读约需4分钟1月30日凌晨3点，护士王皓脱下最后一层脚套，兜着已经发肿的手，离开武汉协和医院西院的隔离区。
With 2216 words, reading takes about 4 minutes. At 3 a.m. on January 30, nurse Wang Hao takes off his last foot-covering and swollen hand in his pocket and leaves the area of separation in the west courtyard of Wuhan Concord Hospital.
1月27日，北京医疗队飞往武汉援助，队员们年龄差显著：既有在SARS、H7N9等疫情中身经百战的“老兵”，还有从未穿过隔离服的年轻人。
On January 27, the Beijing medical team flew to Wuhan to offer assistance. The difference in age between the old soldiers who had fought in SARS and H7N9 and the young men who had never worn quarantine suits was striking.
根据统计，医疗队136人中有26名“90后”，王皓1995年出生，是其中最小的一个。
According to statistics, 26 out of 136 medical teams are "90 days later," Wang Hao was born in 1995, the youngest of them.
他认为，不能光让年长者顶在风口，年轻力量应该站出来了。
He believes that it is not enough to keep the elderly at the mouth of the wind, but that the young should stand up.

摄影/新京报记者 陶冉━━━━━离开隔离区 累到话都不想说新京报：昨天是你第一次进入隔离区护理感染者吗？王皓：没错。
Photo / Beijing News reporter Tao Ran Leaving the Separation Area Not wanting to say anything about the Beijing News: Was it your first visit to the quarantine zone yesterday to take care of infected persons? Wang Hao: Yes.
之前训练时也穿过隔离服，但包得这么严密、进到隔离区救护新型冠状病毒感染者还是头一次。
It was the first time the patient had been so tightly packed that he was admitted to the quarantine zone to help with the new coronary virus.
29号是病区开放的第一天，我们晚上9点到了医院，穿完防护是9点20， 30号凌晨3点10分出来。
We arrived at the hospital at 9: 00 pm. The protective clothing came out at 9: 20 a.m. on the 30th.
进去前有种临上战场的感觉，也有点儿担心能不能做好。
Before entering there is a sense of the battlefield, but also a little worried about the ability to do well.
新京报：里面的情况符合你的预想吗？王皓：比我想的要好一点。
The Beijing News: Are the conditions in the building up to your expectations? Wang Hao: A little better than I thought.
第一天医疗队收治了十多位患者，大部分病情不重，听说北京的专家来了，情绪就比较稳定。
On the first day, the medical team treated more than ten patients, most of whom were not seriously ill.
我们的工作是辅助医生开展治疗、监测患者的生命体征，包括给他们测量体温和血氧、输液等等。
Our job is to assist doctors in performing treatments, monitoring vital signs in patients, including temperature and blood oxygen, infusion, etc.
工作没有想象中的难，但防护给了很大压力，平时走路、挂液体很简单，但裹了一层又一层，简单的动作就变得比较困难。
Work is not as difficult as expected, but protection gives a lot of pressure, usually walking, hanging liquid is very simple, but wrapped layer after layer, simple action becomes more difficult.
新京报：出来后什么感觉？王皓：就是累！我们在里面待了6个小时，穿着防护真的挺辛苦。
The Beijing News: What does it feel like after coming out? Wang Hao: Just tired! We stayed there for 6 hours, really hard to wear protective clothing.
而且我有一点吃亏，我个子太高、手也大，穿最大的隔离服，还要注意克制动作幅度，不然头部可能暴露，手也不舒服，戴了三层手套，出来后手基本紫了。
Besides, I am a little under the weather; I am too tall and have very large hands; I wear the biggest paraphernalia, and I have to watch out for a range of movements that might expose my head and make my hands uncomfortable.
回住处缓了会儿，倒头就睡了。
He returned to his quarters for a while, and fell asleep.
新京报：前两天在医院里看到了成人纸尿裤，你穿了没？王皓：我们在隔离区不能脱衣服、没法上厕所，纸尿裤是必须的，就算不想穿也得穿，我还是在同行的指导下才知道怎么弄，还好他当过爸爸、比较有经验。
The Beijing News: I saw adult diapers in the hospital the other day, are you wearing them? Wang Hao: We can't take off our clothes in the quarantine area, we can't go to the toilet, paper diapers are a must, even if you don't want to wear them, I still know how to do it under the guidance of peers.
确实没想到24岁就穿纸尿裤了，不过一直到出来都没用上，这个还是有点开心的。
Really did not expect 24-year-old wearing diapers, but until it is useless to come out, this is still a bit happy.

受访者供图━━━━━早就等待上前线 惹哭母亲很自责新京报：来武汉支援抗疫，是不是你干过的最刺激的事儿？王皓：职业生涯里肯定是。
2007-9-25 09: 55 Waiting to Go to the Front Line to Cry Earlier Mothers reproached themselves with the Beijing News: Is coming to Wuhan to support the fight against SARS the most exciting thing you've ever done? Wang Hao: Definitely!
新京报：这件事是怎么定下来的？王皓：还挺突然的。
The Beijing News: How did it happen? Wang Hao: It was quite sudden.
1月26号中午，我正在医院上班，护士长突然在群里发了援汉的消息，要求两个小时之内上报，要求护士必须有三年以上工作经验，我正好工作三年出头，赶紧让同事帮忙报上，下班的时候名单就确定了。
At noon on January 26th, while I was working at the hospital, the head nurse suddenly sent a message to the group asking for more than three years' work experience. I was just working in my early three years.
第二天时间更急，群里中午1点7分发通知，让我们2点集合，我前一天大夜班，睡到1点20才醒，赶紧摇醒队友，各自冲回家拿了点洗漱用品就走了，当天就飞来了武汉。
The next day more urgent, the group at 1: 7 noon notice, let us gather at 2 o'clock, I slept the night before 1: 20, wake up teammates, rushed home to get some toiletries and left, the same day flew to Wuhan.
新京报：报名前怎么考虑的？王皓：其实这个机会我已经等很久了。
Beijing News: How do you think about it before signing in? Wang Hao: Actually I've been waiting for this chance for a long time.
这阵子每天都在发疫情新闻，一开始还不怎么上心，后来确认人传人时察觉到严重了，武汉是人流量很大的城市、又赶上春节，就一直想着来这里贡献点儿力量。
Wuhan is a city with a large number of people, and caught up with the Spring Festival, so I always thought of contributing something to it.
真的等到了。
Really waited.
新京报：你是队里年纪最小的，参加工作也不长，怕不怕？王皓：我倒是不很担心自己，就有点担心做得不够好、或者给团队拖后腿，毕竟经验有限。
The Beijing News: As you are the youngest member of the team, you are not afraid to join the work too long.Wang Hao: I am not so worried about myself, I am a little worried about not doing well enough or delaying the team because of my limited experience.
这段时间一直在看疫情相关信息，恶补一下知识。
This time has been looking at the epidemic-related information, evil patchwork knowledge.
队里很多老师经验丰富，有的经历过SARS、甲流，但我觉得，遇到危险不能光让老前辈顶在风口，每个时代都需要年轻人做出表率。
Many of the team's teachers are experienced, some have experienced SARS, swine flu, but I think that the danger can not just let the old people in the wind, each era needs young people to lead by example.
事实上，年轻力量已经站出来了，北京医疗队90后不少，协和医院的护士更小了，有的是96、97年的，都瞒着家里来前线加班，我特别感动。
In fact, I was particularly moved by the fact that young people were already on the scene, many 90 days after the Beijing medical team, and even smaller nurses at Concorde Hospital, some of them in 1996 or 1997, who had come to work at the front without telling their families.
新京报：出发前跟父母商量过吗？王皓：来不及告诉他们了。
The Beijing News: Have you talked to your parents before you leave? Wang Hao: They didn't have time to tell them.
从病区出来，报名已经确定了。
Come out of the area. Registration's confirmed.
觉得没必要让他们担心，也就没特意说。
I didn't feel the need to worry them, so I didn't say it specifically.
新京报：他们知道后什么反应？王皓：我父亲一直觉得国难当头、有能力一定要上；我母亲还是挺担心的，知道我来了武汉，半天没有回消息，后来通电话，让我不要怪她，知道消息后她哭了半天，怕影响到我。
Wang Hao: My father always felt that the country is in a tight spot and has the ability to go with it; my mother is still worried about me coming to Wuhan and didn't get any news after half a day.
我母亲是个很坚强的人，从小到大，从没见过她这样。
My mother is a very strong person, from childhood to childhood, has never seen her like this.
换位思考之后就有点自责，我不光是一个护士，也是一个儿子，做事没有考虑到他们的心情，是有点自私的。
I felt a little guilty after the transposition. I was not only a nurse, but also a son. It was selfish of me not to take their feelings into account.

受访者供图━━━━━到了武汉才有临上战场的感觉新京报：到了武汉心情怎样？王皓：出发前是一腔热血，到了之后情绪下去、理性上来，心情就比较复杂了，毕竟疫情还是很严重的。
2007-9-25 09: 23 2007-9-19 15: 23 2007-09-27 16: 23 2007-09-27 16: 23 2007-09-27 16: 16 2007-09-27 16: 16 2007-09-27 16: 16 2007-09-19 19: 23
专家教我们穿脱隔离服的时候，临上战场的感觉就来了。
When experts teach us to wear protective clothing, the feeling of going to war comes.
好在我们院这次来的都是男生（护士），大家一起聊这个事儿，缓解紧张的情绪。
Fortunately, our hospital is all boys (nurses), we talk about this together, to ease the tense mood.
新京报：这几天怎么过的？王皓：28号凌晨入驻，之后大量时间都在训练隔离防护，医疗队的石月欣老师、辛枫老师、袁磊老师有经验，他们提供指导，也提醒一些可能发生的意外，比如说鞋套需要额外的胶带固定、否则可能脱落，每个人手型不一样、手套也需要固定，口罩绳尽量不要贴到耳朵、可能会造成损伤，等等。
Wang Hao: The 28 in the early hours of the morning, and a lot of time after the training isolation protection, medical team teachers Shi Yuexin, Xin Feng, Yuan Lei, who provide guidance, but also remind some possible accidents, such as extra tape, or may fall off, gloves need to be fixed, gloves to try not to stick to the ear, possible damage, etc.
昨天（29号）才开始报平安，回复家人朋友的一些信息，嘱咐他们不要担心，规整一下房间。
Yesterday (29th) only began to report peace, family and friends to reply to some information, tell them not to worry, organized the room.
我是29号晚上9点的班，时间有点尴尬，睡也睡不着，一直想着上一线的事情，终于等到这一天了，很激动。
I was on the 29th at 9 p. m., a little embarrassed, I couldn't sleep, I was thinking about something on the front line, and finally waited for this day, very excited.
30号从里面出来，好好睡了一觉。
Number 30 came out of it and had a good sleep.
新京报：能够接受在这边支援多久？王皓：只要湖北需要，我们可以在这里看2021年春晚。
Beijing News: How long can we accept support here? Wang Hao: We can watch the 2021 Spring Festival Gala here as long as Hubei needs it.
