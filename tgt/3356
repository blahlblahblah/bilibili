如今中国疫情积极向好的变化是在过去数周广泛的旅行限制，白衣天使以及各路天使的无私奉献中取得的，这与世界其他地区形成鲜明对比。
Today's positive developments in China are the result of extensive travel restrictions over the past few weeks, the altruistic dedication of the white-clad angels and angels, in stark contrast to the rest of the world.
文 | 李 莹因为疫情滞留美国40多天后，3月9日凌晨我终于踏上从旧金山返沪的行程，因中美直航航班的取消不得不转机香港，30个小时经历了三个国际都市，体验了一把不同国家和地区在应对新冠疫情中的管控措施与人情冷暖。
Li Ying finally returned to Shanghai from San Francisco in the early morning of March 9, more than 40 days after the outbreak, because the cancellation of a direct China-US flight had to transit Hong Kong.
旧金山机场从旧金山出发是晚上9点，高速一路畅通，机场井然有序，执勤人员时刻观察着来往者的神情，似乎戴没戴口罩并不是他们关注的重点，也没有人人“额头一枪”。
San Francisco's San Francisco airport starts at 9: 00 p. m., the highway is clear, the airport is in order, the staff are always watching the faces of the people who come and go, they don't seem to be wearing masks, and no one "shoots across the forehead."
谨慎的人口罩、防护眼镜都戴了起来，只是排在安检队伍里稍显格格不入。
Cautious people wear masks and protective glasses, just a little out of place in the security line.
免税店里国语售货员隔着口罩向来往者询问，有没有需要提供帮助，十分热情。
In a duty-free shop, a Mandarin shop assistant asks passers-by through a mask and asks if he needs help.
COACH柜姐有礼有节地介绍着这一季的新品，她说口罩是机场发的，每人一只，戴或不戴自己决定，而到店里亚洲面孔90%的人都戴着口罩，其他肤色大概30%，主要还是中老年人。
She said the mask was issued by the airport, each one of them, wearing or not wearing it, while 90 percent of the Asian faces in the store were wearing masks, about 30 percent of the other skin color, mainly middle-aged and elderly people.
候机厅里航空公司的服务人员在一一询问预登机者是否填妥香港入境健康申报表，有没有去过重点疫情国家，国泰航空的工作人员Luke说，航空公司是有防疫建议的，不强制戴口罩，但如戴就一定要蓝色的医用口罩，其他的不行，所以服务人员戴口罩的非常少。
In the terminal, flight attendants asked the pre-boarding passengers whether they had completed the Hong Kong Immigration Health Declaration Form and whether they had ever been to a priority country. Luke, a Cathay Pacific staff member, said that airlines were advised not to wear masks, but if so, they had to wear blue masks.
飞机上只有三成上座率，一半的人戴着口罩，大家自觉地分隔坐开。
Only 30% of the people on the plane were present, half were wearing masks, and everyone was sitting apart.
经历了15个多小时的躺睡飞行，早上7点我抵达了香港国际机场，下飞机简单快速，没有被要求测体温，转机区各国旅客都戴着口罩，而且有意识地散坐着。
After more than 15 hours of lying and sleeping, I arrived at the Hong Kong International Airport at 7 a.m., got off the plane simply and quickly, without being asked to take a temperature check.
10点后商店渐渐开门，店内静悄悄，店员都戴着口罩站在门口揽客，BURBERRY、GUCCI、IWC门可罗雀，一有人进店马上会被告知有折扣，不少店还打出了机场人员也可以打7折的广告。
The store gradually opened after 10: 00, the store was quiet, shop assistants were wearing masks standing at the door, Burberry, GUCCI, IWC Menke, when someone came into the store will be informed of the discount, a lot of stores also can hit the airport staff can be a discount of 70% advertising.
午餐时间去了顶楼餐饮区，一看，哪都空荡荡的，原先好生意的正斗、美心、翠园都不需要排队，收餐盘的阿姨跟我说，从疫情肆虐开始往来香港的飞机就大量减少，人少了好多好多，现在用餐的大多是机场工作人员，他们按要求戴口罩手套服务，但大多数时间没有什么事情做。
At lunchtime, I went to the dining area of the top floor and saw that everything was empty. My aunt who picked up the plates told me that the number of planes to and from Hong Kong had fallen off dramatically since the outbreak of the epidemic.
广播里一直播放着重要通知，提示香港人近期不要前往湖北。
Important notices have been broadcast on the radio reminding Hong Kong people not to go to Hubei in the near future.
一餐120元的拉面就着纪录片《沸腾吧，火锅》火爆下肚，备感思乡。
One meal 120 yuan ramen noodles on the documentary "Boil bar, hotpot" hot belly, feel homesick.
机场里人烟寥寥下午2点多，登机口信息终于出来了，缓缓移动过去，发现候机人还真多，从肤色、口音判断，美国的、欧洲的、上海的、北京的、浙闽的都有，人人戴着口罩，还有人戴着乳胶手套。
The airport was deserted at 2: 00 pm, the boarding gate information finally came out, slowly moving over, found that the waiting people are really many, judging from the color, accent, the United States, Europe, Shanghai, Beijing, Zhejiang are all wearing masks, and others wearing latex gloves.
登机时间一到，大排长龙，航空公司人员一一询问乘客是否来自“重点地区”，并在登机卡做了标记后才放行登机，九成以上的上座率吓得我全程口罩没脱下来过，而机舱服务也从过去的选择用餐变成了发放简餐袋，服务人员与乘客基本无接触。
When boarding time arrived, the airline staff asked passengers whether they were from "key areas" and allowed them to board only after the boarding pass was marked. More than 90% of the attendance scared me out of my entire mask and the cabin service shifted from the old choice of dining to the delivery of a light meal with little contact between the flight attendants and passengers.
终于到浦东机场啦抵达浦东机场是下午6点，飞机停稳后机长通知大家不要动，要等海关上来量体温接送客人。
Pudong Airport finally arrived at Pudong Airport at 6: 00 pm, the plane stopped stable after the captain told everyone not to move, to wait for customs to take temperature to pick up guests.
过了40分钟第一组20人被点名下了飞机，里面大多数是外国人，大家交头接耳起来：难道是欧洲来的？刚刚与他们在密闭客舱里共处2个多小时不会有什么危险吧？……第二组叫到了我的名字，有点不知所措地到了舱门口，马上看到2个穿着白色防护服的人，一个拿着名单核对勾选，一个拿着体温枪，手腕、头部要各扫一枪，极其认真。
After 40 minutes the first group of 20 men were named off the plane, most of them foreigners, whispering to each other: Is it Europe? The second group called my name, got a little confused at the door, and immediately saw two men in white suits, one with a list check, one with a body temperature gun, one with a wrist and one with a head.
大概是之前戴口罩闷的，到我时头上一枪后说：“你不要走，旁边等一下。
Probably wearing a mask before stuffy, to my head after a shot said: "You do not go, wait a moment.
”我顿时心跳加速，手都有点小抖。
"My heart beat fast and my hands trembled a little.
过了漫长的三分钟，检查人员又给了我一枪，还好这次正常，说可以走了。
After a long three minutes, the inspector gave me another shot, but fortunately this time normal, said can go.
独自走过二三米的廊桥，只见我们第二组与第一组乘客都还没走出玻璃门厅，门外深蓝色防护服女士在用手机不断指挥着里面的机场工作人员清点人数，终于第一批42人达标，门开启了，刚刚那位下飞机时核对名字的海关人员在过道中把大家排成两列，领着我们前往检查大厅。
As we walked across the corridor two or three metres alone, the second group and the first group of passengers were still out of the glass hall. The woman in deep blue was holding the number of airport staff on her mobile phone. The first group of 42 persons reached the target.
“请扫码，网上填报好再进入面谈。
"Please scan the code and fill in the form before you enter the interview.
”检查区域里全是穿防护服的人，很多人衣服背面都写着：退役军人，一种敬意赫然而生，你们始终是人民的卫士，最可爱的人。
The inspection area was filled with men in protective clothing, many of them with the words on the back: veterans, a sort of reverence; you have always been guardians of the people, loveliest men.
我被分配到一位和蔼的女检查员桌前坐下，她一一询问了我“来自哪”“去过哪”、个人信息和有无不舒服症状，仔细交谈后，她看了我在健康云上填的《健康信息登记表》编号后示意给我放行。
Assigned to an affable woman inspector table, she asked me where I had come from, where I had been, personal information and symptoms of discomfort. After careful conversation, she looked at the Health Information Registration Form number I filled out on the health cloud and motioned me to release it.
通往海关查验口的路上，又经历了几次查验健康表编号和量体温，我这种登机卡上没有颜色的被安排走绿色通道，还有黄色和红色的估计是需观察和紧急人员走的，最终我走到了海关查护照关口，在几个问题的询问后，护照被贴上了绿色圆标签，顺利走出海关。
On the way to the customs check-out point, I went through several more check-ups of the health form number and body temperature, I was placed in a green channel without color on my boarding card, and yellow and red were estimated to require observation and emergency personnel to leave.
从旧金山出发到上海，从美国国门到中国国门的三十多个小时，三个城市管理从松到紧，上海是最严格也是最温情的，就像在机场听到的最多的话是：请大家理解，这是对大家负责。
From San Francisco to Shanghai, from the United States Gate to the Chinese State Gate for more than 30 hours, the management of the three cities from loose to tight, Shanghai is the most strict and tender, as I heard at the airport: please understand that this is responsible to everyone.
如今中国疫情积极向好的变化是在过去数周广泛的旅行限制，白衣天使以及各路天使的无私奉献中取得的，这与世界其他地区形成鲜明对比。
Today's positive developments in China are the result of extensive travel restrictions over the past few weeks, the altruistic dedication of the white-clad angels and angels, in stark contrast to the rest of the world.
