地球被毁灭之前究竟发生了什么？。
What happened before the earth was destroyed?
作者 | 龚方毅编辑 |韩方航毫无疑问，新型冠状病毒肺炎将重创中国今年一季度经济产出。
AT & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
在空前严厉的防疫措施限制下，工厂停工，餐饮、住宿、航旅业萧条，各类线下实体生意遭遇毁灭性打击，现金流基本为零。
Under the restrictions of unprecedented anti-epidemic measures, factories closed down, catering, accommodation, travel industry depression, various kinds of real business suffered a devastating impact, the cash flow is basically zero.
但各种税租不会停。
But all kinds of taxes don't stop.
出租车停工，份子钱照交；餐厅停业，租金照交；企业放假，税金、社保照交，贷款利息照常产生。
Taxis were stopped and money paid; restaurants were closed and rents paid; businesses had holidays, taxes and social security payments, and interest on loans was generated as usual.
经济学有一个分支叫“灾难经济学”。
One branch of economics is called the economics of disaster.
它将地震、火灾、水灾等定义为需求刺激型灾难，传染性疾病、公共卫生突发事件列为需求抑制性。
It defines earthquakes, fires, floods, and so on as demand-stimulating disasters, communicable diseases, public health emergencies as a demand inhibitor.
前者在灾难发生期间消费抑制、财富毁灭，但之后的重建会提升需求。
The former depresses consumption and destroys wealth during a disaster, but subsequent reconstruction boosts demand.
相当于一部分需求减少，激活了另一部分需求。
This corresponds to a reduction in demand, which activates another part of the demand.
最终经济活动总量提高或者复苏。
Total final economic activity increases or recovers.
反过来，疫情没有摧毁实体基础设施，而是摧毁了人们消费、投资的欲望和信心，以及随之而来的各种会务、商贸活动。
The epidemic, in turn, has not destroyed the physical infrastructure, but rather the desire and confidence of people to consume and invest, with all the attendant business and trade activities.
非典时期，中国改革基金会国民经济研究所所长樊纲说，“这种灾难的经济影响基本上可以说是彻头彻尾地在减少需求”。
"The economic impact of this disaster is basically a complete demand reduction," said Fan Gang, director of the National Economic Research Institute of the China Reform Foundation during the SARS period.
【1】王健林的万达广场免除商户一个月租金和物业费绝对是善举，但万达本身也有经营和偿债压力。
Wanda Square in Wang Jianlin is absolutely a good thing to let merchants rent and property fees for a month, but Wanda has its own operating and debt-servicing pressure.
截至去年三季度末，万达长期借款和应负债权超过 1440 亿。
By the end of last year, Wanda had long-term loans and claims of more than $144 billion.
现金流也吃紧。
Cash flow is tight, too.
【2】【3】而万达这样大而不能倒的业主方毕竟是少数。
2007-9-24 15: 55 [hide] And Vanda is, after all, a minority of owners.
现金流吃紧的各类实体、商服数量不会少。
Cash flow is tight across a variety of entities, business clothing will not be small.
如果没有政策扶持，可以想象很多中小微企业可能难以为继。
Without policy support, it was conceivable that many MSMEs might not be able to sustain themselves.
在这次系统性风险引发的现金流危急中关门歇业。
It was shut down in the face of a systemic risk-induced cash flow crisis.
勉力支撑的企业可能或者即将通过各种方式方法减少投资支出、降低成本，包括裁员。
Struggling companies may or will soon reduce investment spending and costs, including layoffs, in a variety of ways and means.
身处其中的大多数人在失业压力下，不自觉的降低消费倾向，压缩消费支出。
Most of them, under the pressure of unemployment, unconsciously reduce their propensity to consume and compress their spending.
经济活动环环相扣，消费抑制、生产减少、投资缩水，经济活动总量下跌。
Economic activity is intertwined, with depressed consumption, reduced production, shrinking investment and a decline in total economic activity.
在全国开了 400 多家连锁店的西贝也遇到了麻烦。
Sebei, which operates more than 400 chain stores across the country, is also in trouble.
董事长贾国龙接受投中网采访时说“疫情致 2 万多员工待业，贷款发工资也只能撑 3 月”。
"The epidemic has left more than 20, 000 employees unemployed and only three months of loan payouts," Chairman Jia Guolong told SciDev.Net.
【20】“在这个行业里边我们日子还算不错的，那日子不好的呢？我们贷上款，勒紧腰带发三个月工资，其他品牌其他企业呢？”贾国龙说，“你要知道餐饮业三四千万的就业，把这些人都推到社会，那是什么光景？”投中网，《西贝贾国龙：疫情致2万多员工待业 贷款发工资也只能撑3月》有很多分析师用 2003 年 SARS 疫情爆发期间中国的经济活动推演新冠肺炎疫情之后的经济走势。
2007-9-24 16: 19 [hide] "We had a good day in the industry, but the days were bad? We took out loans, tightened belts and paid three months' wages," Jia said.
这种比较的局限性在于，十七年来，中国无论是城镇化水平、交通基础设施密度、经济结构、产业结构、企业和居民负债率等等，已经有了天翻地覆的变化。
The limitation of this comparison is that, in the past 17 years, China has undergone tremendous changes in terms of the level of urbanization, density of transportation infrastructure, economic structure, industrial structure, debt ratio of enterprises and residents, etc.
如果只根据当时全国的经济增长水平来推演接下去可能面临的问题，无异于刻舟求剑。
To infer the problems that might lie ahead solely on the basis of the level of economic growth then prevailing in the country would be tantamount to a desperate attempt.
2003 年，中国 GDP 单季度增速分别为 11.1%、9.1%、10% 和 10%，非典影响有限。
In 2003, China's GDP grew by 11.1 per cent, 9.1 per cent, 10 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively, with limited impact.
第三产业的拖累也有限。
The tertiary sector is also a limited drag.
【4】当时中国正处在加入 WTO 之后的红利期，经济高速增长，甚至还有些过热，一季度投资增长高达 27%。
2007-9-24 17: 53 [hide] China was in the dividend phase after its accession to the WTO, with rapid economic growth and even overheating, with investment rising as high as 27 percent in the first quarter.
城镇化、工业化和消费升级的需求实际存在，抵消了疫情带来的消费抑制。
Demand for urbanization, industrialization and rising consumption actually exists, offsetting the consumption constraints brought about by the epidemic.
该年国内旅客周转量增速为 -2.3%，国内旅游人次下降 0.9%；旅游总收入下降 11.2%。
Domestic tourist turnover grew by -2.3 per cent in that year, domestic tourist arrivals fell by 0.9 per cent and total tourism receipts fell by 11.2 per cent.
同期轻工业增加值 +14.6%（加快 2.5 个百分点），重工业增加值 +18.6%（加快 5.5 个百分点）。
During the same period, the value added of light industry was + 14.6 per cent (2.5 percentage points faster) and that of heavy industry + 18.6 per cent (5.5 percentage points faster).
以至于三季度结束后，几乎所有的财经媒体都在问，中国经济是否过热？【5】但只看城市，例如疫情最重的北京和广州，经济数据变化则是另一种状态。
Even after the end of the third quarter, almost all the financial press was asking whether the Chinese economy was overheating [5] But looking only at cities, such as Beijing and Guangzhou, where the epidemic is most severe, the economic data change is a different story.
2003 年北京一季度经济增速达 12.7%，二季度增速减半。
Beijing's economy grew 12.7 percent in the first quarter of 2003 and halved in the second quarter.
地区社会消费品零售增速跌幅更惊人，一季度增速高达 24.2%，上半年结束降至 13.7%，粗略估算二季度基本没增长。
Regional retail sales of consumer goods fell even more dramatically, rising 24.2 per cent in the first quarter to 13.7 per cent in the first half and barely rising in the second quarter.
2003 年广州一季度第三产业增加值同比增加 14.1%，二季度降到 13.5%，三、四季度均只有 10.2% 的增速。
The added value of tertiary industry in Guangzhou increased by 14.1 percent in the first quarter of 2003 and fell to 13.5 percent in the second quarter.
当年还有一个重灾区香港，疫情爆发前正逐渐走出金融危机的影响，2002 年第三季度香港实际国内生产总值增长 3.4%，第四季度为 5.1%。
Hong Kong, a major disaster area, was emerging from the financial crisis before the outbreak, with real GDP growing by 3.4 per cent in the third quarter of 2002 and 5.1 per cent in the fourth quarter.
随后疫情爆发，2003 年一季度香港经济增速 4.5%，二季度负增长。
Hong Kong's economy grew 4.5% in the first quarter of 2003 and turned negative in the second quarter.
【6】这些城市最终花了半年到一年的时间方才恢复元气。
It took the cities six months to a year to recover.
它们是中国经济最发达的城市之一，作为观察样本更微观、但可能也对今天更有观察意义。
They are one of the most economically developed cities in China and are more microscopic in their observation sample, but may also be more relevant today.
至于此次疫情对经济的影响，按照中泰证券首席李迅雷的看法，“（去年）4 季度经济增速仍在下滑，继续创新低……这场突如其来的疫情，可能就会出现一些原本不成为问题的问题”。
As for the impact of the outbreak on the economy, according to Li Xunlei, chief executive of Cathay Pacific Securities, "economic growth continued to decline in the fourth quarter and continue to hit new lows... This sudden outbreak could lead to problems that otherwise would not have been a problem."
他认为第三产业肯定首当其冲，其次是第二产业，最后是农林牧渔业。
He thought the tertiary industry would surely bear the brunt, followed by the secondary sector and finally agriculture, forestry and fisheries.
微博上已经有养鸡户在求助【7】。
There are already chicken farmers on Weibo [7].
因为道路封路，养鸡的饲料无法运抵；即便运进来也没用，现在各地关停活物养殖、交易场所，养鸡场也被习惯一刀切的地方政府叫停，损失惨重。
Because of the road closures, chicken feed could not arrive; even if it did not work, the places where live animals are raised and traded are now shut down, and chicken farms have been stopped by the local government, which is used to one-size-fits-all, with heavy losses.
【17】并且由于新冠肺炎病毒传播力目前看来超过 SARS，使得“不能因为疫情峰值过去后就认为经济会恢复正常”。
And because transmission of the new crown pneumonia virus now appears to surpass SARS, "the economy should not be assumed to return to normal after the peak."
SARS 期间，根据时任亚洲开发银行驻中国代表处首席经济学家汤敏的观察，中小企业，特别是从事服务业的中小企业受到巨大冲击，大量的小餐馆、理发店、装修队、小商店、家政服务等或停业或门可罗雀。
During SARS, according to Tang Min, then Chief Economist of the Asian Development Bank's Representative Office in China, small and medium-sized enterprises, especially those engaged in services, were hit hard, with a large number of small restaurants, hairdressers, decoration teams, small shops, domestic service, etc., either closed or absent.
【8】民营企业提供了 80％ 的城镇就业岗位，吸纳了 70％ 以上的农村转移劳动力。
Private enterprises provide 80 percent of urban jobs and absorb more than 70 percent of the rural labor force transfer.
各类小店倒闭，农村和贫困地区转移到城市的劳动力自然流出。
All kinds of small shops closed down, rural and poverty-stricken areas to the urban labor force natural outflow.
中小微企业家也接着沦为失业人口。
MSMEs then became unemployed.
【9】国务院研究发展中心曾估算，当年全国旅游业从业人数大约 600 万人，50% 的人受疫情影响。
The Center for Research and Development of the State Council estimated that about 6 million people were employed in the tourism industry that year, with 50 percent affected by the epidemic.
其他直接受冲击的行业还包括餐饮、建筑、商服等。
Other sectors directly affected include catering, construction, business services, etc.
【10】北京曾在疫情尚未解除的时候（但快结束了），即发布救济文件，对企业的减负措施包括对受非典型肺炎疫情影响比较严重的行业，免征部分行政事业性收费、政府性基金，对部分行业、单位、个人实行税收优惠政策等。
2007-9-24 15: 16 [hide] Beijing issued relief documents while the epidemic was still unfolding. Measures to reduce the burden on enterprises included waiving some administrative institutional fees and government funds, and imposing preferential tax policies on some industries, units and individuals.
执行期为 2003 年 5 月 1 日起至 2003 年 9 月 30 日。
The performance period is from 1 May 2003 to 30 September 2003.
【11】台湾、香港地区以及新加坡也在非典期间有各自的扶持方案，以提供优惠贷款为主。
Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore also had their own support programs during the SARS epidemic, focusing on providing concessional loans.
【12】这次武汉新冠状病毒肺炎扩散面更广，且发生在中国处在经济下行周期之际，如果中央和地方有意支持经济发展，可能也要等到疫情扩散的拐点出现之后。
The new Wuhan coronavirus pneumonia is spreading more widely, and comes at a time when China is in the midst of an economic downturn. If the central and local governments are interested in supporting the economic development, they may have to wait until the inflection point of the epidemic spreads.
两次重大疫情对经济的负面影响程度不同，但都是中小企业受影响最大几乎板上钉钉。
The two major outbreaks have had different negative effects on the economy, but they are almost certain to affect SMEs the most.
它们又几乎都是民企，或者个体工商户。
They are almost all private enterprises, or individual businesses.
【13】这几年民营经济一直在过冬。
The private economy has been wintering these years.
遇到的问题包括但不限于去杠杆、供给侧改革、融资难等。
Problems include, but are not limited to, deleveraging, supply-side reforms, and financing difficulties.
一组由招银国际首席经济学家丁安华统计的数据显示，受到中国供给侧改革的影响，2016 年初至 2018 年年中，煤炭开采、黑色矿开采、有色矿开采等 11 个供给侧改革行业有约 1.1 万家公司消失，将近一成的公司消失，要么是破产、要么是被并购。
Between early 2016 and mid-2018, about 11,000 companies disappeared in 11 supply-side reform sectors, including coal mining, black mining and non-ferrous mining, and nearly 10 per cent disappeared, either bankrupt or merged, according to a group of Ding Anhua, chief economist at CMB International.
其中钢铁、煤炭企业数量缩减的幅度分别超过 50%、30%。
Among them, the number of steel, coal enterprises decreased by more than 50%, 30% respectively.
【14】私营工业企业曾在 2015 年 5 月至 2016 年 12 月间经历了难得的利息支出减少期。
Private-sector industrial companies experienced a rare period of decline in interest payments between May 2015 and December 2016.
之后利息累计支出一直增加，2018 年财务费用和利息支出都双位数增长。
Cumulative interest payments have since increased, with double-digit increases in both finance and interest payments in 2018.
2019 年单月的财务费用有升有降。
The single month of 2019 has seen a rise and decrease in financial costs.
收入不畅，利息飙涨，利润侵蚀。
Income is poor, interest rates are skyrocketing and profits are eroding.
截至 2019 年 11 月，累计私营工业企业亏损数同比增加 11%。
As of November 2019, the cumulative losses of private industrial enterprises had increased by 11 per cent compared to the same period.
而这个时候，有关部门一方面发文要求企业继续发工资、发加班工资，一方面又不允许企业“哄抬物价”，成本高企、售价抑制，那企业、门店干脆关门算了。
At this time, the relevant departments on the one hand sent a letter to enterprises to continue to pay wages, overtime, on the one hand, and do not allow enterprises to "bid up prices," high costs, price repression, then enterprises, stores simply closed down.
一些处罚更是有待商榷。
Some penalties are even more debatable.
比如陕西一药店的口罩进价 19 元、售价 25 元，毛利率 31%，结果被吊销执照。
For example, a pharmacy in Shaanxi Province for 19 yuan, 25 yuan price, 31% gross interest rate, the result was revoked license.
【15】只有乌托邦主义者才会只从人道主义和社会伦理的角度来理解这些问题。
Only Utopians will understand these problems only from a humanitarian and socio-ethical perspective.
经济学上，生意唯有有利可图，才会推动资源向生产、贸易急救物资集中，从而增大供给，使满足需求缺口成为可能，并最终使价格回落。
In economics, only a profitable business can propel resources toward production, trade, and emergency supplies, thereby increasing supply, making it possible to meet demand gaps, and ultimately reducing prices.
国家机器如果动用限价或者高价罚款，恐怕只能解决上游生产，无法疏导下游终端和零售市场的阻塞。
If the state machinery to use price limits or high fines, I am afraid only to solve upstream production, unable to channel downstream terminals and retail market congestion.
战时计划经济可能是另外一种解决办法，这里不再展开。
The wartime planned economy may be another solution, and it is no longer here.
世界卫生组织 30 日宣布将新冠肺炎疫情, 构成国际关注的突发公共卫生事件，即“PHEIC”。
The World Health Organization announced on the 30th that the outbreak of pneumonia in the new crown constitutes a public health emergency of international concern, known as "PHEIC."
它曾被不少人渲染为中国将成疫区国、为期三年、所有进出中国的交通工具、货物、人都将接受严格检疫审查，这将使中国经济承受灭顶之灾。
It has been touted by many as a country where China will become a pestilence area for a period of three years. All means of transport, goods and people entering and leaving China will be subject to strict quarantine inspection, which will put the Chinese economy in jeopardy.
世卫组织是联合国系统内卫生问题的指导和协调机构。
WHO is the steering and coordinating agency for health within the United Nations system.
中文也是工作语言之一。
Chinese is also one of the working languages.
关于公共卫生事件本身的定义、为何宣布这次新冠肺炎构成 PHEIC、缔约国要做什么，世卫组织官网均有详细说明。
The definition of public health events per se, why the declaration of this new crown pneumonia constitutes PHEIC, and what the State party is going to do are detailed on the WHO website.
【16】世卫组织表示，“根据现有信息，委员会不建议实施任何旅行或贸易限制……请各国不要采取可能助长侮辱或歧视的行动”。
According to WHO, "on the basis of the information available, the Committee does not recommend the imposition of any travel or trade restrictions... and invites States to refrain from acts that could contribute to stigmatization or discrimination."
如果中国疫情控制顺利，三个月内这个状态可能提前解除。
If the outbreak is under control, it could be lifted sooner than three months.
另外：根据《国际卫生条例》第四十三条规定，采取明显干扰国际交通的额外卫生措施(指拒绝国际旅行者、行李、货物、集装箱、交通工具、物品等入境或出境或延误入境或出境24小时以上)的缔约国有义务在采取措施后48小时内向世卫组织报告相关公共卫生依据和理由。
In addition, under article 43 of the International Health Regulations, States parties that take additional health measures that significantly interfere with international traffic (meaning denial of entry or exit of international travellers, luggage, cargo, containers, means of transport, goods, etc., or delays in entering or leaving the country for more than 24 hours) are obliged to report to WHO within 48 hours of the measure being taken.
世卫组织将审查这些理由，并可能要求有关国家重新考虑其措施。
WHO will review these grounds and may request the States concerned to reconsider their measures.
世卫组织必须与其他缔约国分享关于所收到的措施和理由的信息。
WHO must share with other States parties information on measures and justifications received.
这些建议或者指导意见，并不具有强制效力。
These recommendations or guidance shall not have mandatory effect.
在新冠肺炎前，世卫组织曾宣布过五次PHEIC，其中 2016 年寨卡病毒构成 PHEIC 期间，巴西里约还举行了奥运会。
Before the outbreak of Pneumonia, WHO had announced five PHEIC events, including the 2016 Zika virus, which formed PHEIC, and the Olympic Games in Rio, Brazil.
PHEIC 的宣布并未额外冲击当地贸易和经济。
The PHEIC announcement has not had an additional impact on local trade and the economy.
所以，具体的负面影响还是取决于各国本身的判断。
The specific negative impact was therefore dependent on the judgement of States themselves.
世卫组织宣布 PHEIC 可能会让它们更坚决的执行一些限制。
The WHO announced that PHEIC might make them more assertive in enforcing some of the restrictions.
实际上在世卫组织宣布上述决定前，已有部分国家和地区限制中国公民前往、暂停航班或者火车通行。
In fact, before WHO announced the decision, some countries and regions had restricted Chinese citizens from going to, suspending flights or passing by train.
界面新闻援引国际防疫专家的话说，世卫组织接下来可能就国际货物、集装箱、交通工具等提出建议，例如对中国进出口货物进行额外检疫，从而影响成本与效率，使进出口贸易受到冲击。
Interface News quotes international experts on epidemic prevention as saying the WHO could then make recommendations on international cargo, containers, and vehicles, such as additional quarantine on Chinese imports and exports, thereby affecting costs and efficiency and hurting import and export trade.
【18】届时限制中国交通、贸易、外事交流的国家和地区是否跟进解除，也取决于当地政府。
Whether countries and regions that restrict China's traffic, trade and foreign exchange will follow suit will also depend on the local government.
目前根据外交部领事司的汇总（截至 1/31），全球已有 62 个国家和地区对中国公民实施入境管制。
According to the summary of the Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (up to 1 / 31), China's citizens have been subject to entry controls in 62 countries and regions around the world.
【19】光大集团研究院副院长彭文生认为，PHEIC 可能对国际贸易尤其出口有所影响，“但应该是轻微的，关键还是要看疫情本身未来的发展”。
According to Peng Wensheng, vice-president of Everbright Group Research, PHEIC may have an impact on international trade, especially exports, but "it should be slight, and the key is the future of the epidemic itself."
通常，传染性高、毒性稍弱的疫情相比毒性强、传染力稍弱对经济的影响更大。
Typically, epidemics with higher infectious and lower toxicity have a greater impact on the economy than more toxic and less infectious ones.
【21】他建议，中央和地方的救济政策应对更多应该是有针对性的扶持，帮助受影响严重的行业、地区和群体，而不应该是大水漫灌式。
He suggested that central and local relief policies should focus more on targeted support to heavily affected industries, regions and groups than on flooding.

面对疫情，公民除了配合和感动，还可以了解什么？我们是几个记者（前），临时组成一个报道小组，试图在当下提供一些关于新型冠状病毒传染病的新的视角。
In the face of the epidemic, what else can the citizens understand besides cooperating and moving? We are a few journalists (former), temporarily forming a reporting group to try to provide a new perspective on the new coronavirus infection.
