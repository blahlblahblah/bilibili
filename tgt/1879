经过这次疫情，我对《我不是药神》这部电影感触特别深。
After the outbreak, I was particularly impressed with the movie "I'm not a pharmacist."
我明白了平时物资储存的重要性，这样在特殊时期才能派上大用场。
I've learned the importance of stocking up on a regular basis so that it can be put to good use in special times.
口述 |赵　勐整理 | 王仲昀我叫赵勐，干物流行业的。
Zhao Zhongyun, whose name is Zhao Mone, does logistics industry.
大年初一下午，我一个人在家睡觉。
On the afternoon of New Year's Day, I sleep alone at home.
醒来看到微信群里有人说，仙桃那边有给武汉的医疗物资被卡住，出不来。
Wake up to see the micro-letter group said that there is a peach side of medical supplies to Wuhan was stuck, can not get out.
我想，在家闲着也没事干，就去帮帮忙吧，看能不能把那批货运出来。
I don't think I can do anything at home, so I'll go help and see if I can get the shipment out.
反正从武汉到仙桃，我开车来回也就三个多小时。
Anyway, from Wuhan to Xiantao, I drive back and forth also more than three hours.
于是下午六点我就出发了。
So I set off at six in the afternoon.
没想到，那天夜里我的车陷进了乡下的泥巴地，我在空无一人的地方被困了一夜，没吃没喝，手机没电。
Unexpectedly, that night my car got stuck in the mud in the countryside. I was stranded in an empty place all night without food, drink or electricity.
更想不到的是，这一去就是好多天。
Not to mention the fact that this trip is many days.
从那天开始，我就一直往返仙桃和武汉之间运输、配送物资。
From that day on, I have been between the peach and Wuhan transport, distribution of supplies.
赵勐送物资途中接送医务人员上下班，看能不能找到女朋友大概过年前几天，有一天我去了武汉附近乡下，想要为过年准备一点烟花。
Zhao Mengdian delivery of supplies to and from work, see if I can find a girlfriend a few days before the New Year, one day I went to Wuhan near the countryside, to prepare a little fireworks for the New Year.
没想到回来之前，有朋友让我路上看看能不能帮忙买点口罩。
Before I came back, I was asked by some friends to see if I could buy some masks.
他告诉我，当时武汉已经买不到口罩了。
Wuhan, he told me, could no longer buy a mask.
于是我就去找那些卖口罩的店，想着多买点回去可以分给其他人。
So I went to the stores that sold masks, thinking of buying more to give away to others.
没想到最后被放了鸽子，人家不卖了。
Did not expect to be finally set free pigeons, people do not sell.
这是我对疫情的最初感受。
That is my first feeling of the epidemic.
从乡下回到武汉没多久，我就看到朋友圈有人求助，说找人帮忙运物资和接送医护人员上下班。
Not long after I returned to Wuhan from the countryside, I saw help from friends, who said they needed help transporting supplies and paramedics to and from work.
因为我单身嘛，我89年的，到现在还没结婚。
Because I'm single, I'm 89, and I'm not married yet.
我就有个私心，想着“患难见真情”，准备去接送医护人员，帮忙的同时看看能不能搭识个女朋友。
I had a selfish ambition to "see the truth," to pick up the paramedics, help and see if I could meet a girlfriend.
我平时是做物流的，有两辆面包车。
I usually do logistics, there are two vans.
接了几趟之后，我了解到，为医院配送物资更紧要一点，医院很缺人去送物资。
After several trips, I learned that it was more urgent to deliver supplies to hospitals, which were short of people to deliver them.
突然之间，儿女之情，好像就不重要了。
All of a sudden, it doesn't seem important.
第一次出车，被困在乡道上一整夜那天晚上是疫情暴发后，我第一趟去运物资。
First trip, stranded on the country road That night was my first trip after the outbreak.
当我把车开到蔡甸和仙桃交界的地方，因为当时武汉已经封城，国道不让走，导航就让我走了乡道。
When I drove the car to the junction of Cai dian and Xiantao, because Wuhan had been closed, the national road was not allowed to go, navigation let me go to the countryside.
大晚上，乡道路况不好，我开得很慢。
In the evening, the country roads were in bad condition and I drove slowly.
结果晚上九点多，路过一片泥巴地，我的车就陷进去出不来了。
As a result, more than 9 pm, passing a piece of mud, my car stuck in can not get out.
我先是给警察打电话求助，但因为我没法证明我是去帮忙运物资的，而且地处武汉仙桃交界处，他们也解决不了。
First I called the police for help, but because I couldn't prove that I was there to help deliver the supplies, and because I was at the intersection of Wuhan with the peach, they couldn't solve it.
我又找朋友帮忙，当时我联系了武汉抗疫志愿者联盟的总协调人邓明锋先生，但他们的货车也没有能用的拉绳。
I asked my friends for help when I contacted Mr. Deng Mingfeng, the general coordinator of the Wuhan Anti-epidemic Volunteer League, but their lorries had no working ropes.
尝试之后，都没办法，我就只能在原地等待。
After trying, there is no way, I can only wait in place.
我那辆车上空调坏了，我出来时又没穿秋裤，就觉得很冷。
The air conditioner on my car broke down and I came out feeling cold without my pants.
然后没吃的没喝的，我手机电也快用完了。
And then no food to drink, my cell phone is running out of electricity.
关机前，我把定位给邓先生发过去了，就说如果来找我的话，我就在这。
Before I turned it off, I sent it to Mr. Deng and said that if I came to see me, I would be right here.
虽然我也不知道那地方到底是哪。
I don't know where that place is, though.
因为有点怕，我也不敢睡觉，就只能眯一会儿。
Because of a little fear, I dare not sleep, can only squint for a while.
大概夜里三点多我睡了过去，早上五点就醒了。
I went to sleep about three in the night and woke up at five in the morning.
大年初一晚上，赵勐被困在乡道上被困第二天，赵勐招来挖掘机帮忙醒来后，我下车去找附近路过的车辆帮忙，结果不行；后来又去村子里找农民借工具，还是不行；最后，找了个开挖掘机的，我给了对方400块钱，终于把车子拖了出来。
On the first night of New Year's Day, Zhao Mone was trapped in the township road the next day, Zhao Mone Mongton help wake up, I got out to find nearby vehicles to help, but the results, and then went to the village to borrow tools from farmers, but could not; finally, I found a digger, I gave the other 400 dollars, finally pulled the car out.
被困了一晚上后，我只想赶紧去仙桃，没想过原路返回武汉。
After being trapped for a night, I just want to hasten to the peach, never thought of the original way back to Wuhan.
因为我已经费了这么大力气开出来，不想空车回去，我一定得去拉点什么。
Because I've tried so hard to get out of here and not want to go back empty, I've got to get something.
那天白天，我在去仙桃的路上一直找商店给手机充电，我不能跟别人失联。
That day, I was on my way to the peach store to recharge my phone. I couldn't lose touch with anyone else.
然后经过前一晚的事情，我顺带找人借被子，以防后面还要在车上睡觉。
Then, after what had happened the night before, I had someone borrow quilts in case I had to sleep in the back.
有个阿姨很好，送给我一床旧被子。
An aunt is very kind. Give me an old quilt.
路上在一家小店吃泡面的时候，老板儿子听说我是从武汉出来的，就让我吃完赶紧走。
On the way to eat noodles in a small shop, the boss son heard that I came from Wuhan, let me eat and hurry to go.
一路上因为封城，很多路走不了，各种路障，等我到仙桃，已经是大年初二晚上。
Along the way because of the blockade, many roads can not walk, various roadblocks, waiting for me to the peach, is the New Year's Eve.
正常一个多小时就到的路程，结果那天用了一天。
It was more than an hour's walk away and it took one day.
当晚，我在仙桃找酒店住宿又找了好几个小时，因为很多也关门了。
That night, I spent hours looking for a hotel in a peach, as many of them were closed.
被人怀疑倒卖物资，曾想过放弃那天我到了仙桃后，照理说找到之前求助的人，把他们的物资拉上车送回武汉就行。
Suspected of buying and selling goods, thought of giving up on the day I arrived in the peach, it is logical to find the people before help, pull their supplies to the car back to Wuhan.
但我根据平时物流工作的经验，发现那边比较混乱，没有人统筹整合物资，资源没有被最好地利用。
But according to my usual logistics experience, found there is more confusion, no one integrated materials, resources are not the best use.
这样一来，我决定留在那边帮忙。
So I decided to stay there and help.
后来我找到当地一家公司合作，在他们的办公大厅，成立了一个临时的物资基地。
Later I found a local company to work with, in their office lobby, set up a temporary material base.
我按照平时送快递的方式，在基地开始接收和配送物资。
I began to receive and distribute materials at the base in accordance with the usual courier service.
这些物资大多是要送给武汉的各大医院。
Most of these materials are to be sent to major hospitals in Wuhan.
仙桃当地有物资送到我这里来，每一笔我都做好记录，什么人送的，送了什么，送到武汉哪里，就跟快递站一样。
The local supply of peach sent to me, I have a good record of each, who sent, what sent, to Wuhan, just like the express station.
之后，我再负责把仙桃出来的物资统一转送到武汉各个医院，精确到各个科室。
After that, I am responsible for the peach out of the unified transfer of materials to Wuhan hospitals, accurate to the various departments.
很多时候我们是凌晨去送货。
A lot of times we deliver in the wee hours.
晚上11点从仙桃出发，这样1点左右到武汉，然后分好货送到医院。
Start at 11 pm from the peach, so that around 1 o'clock to Wuhan, and then separate goods to the hospital.
因为医院的医生护士交班一般是早上6点，我们争取在人家交班之前送到，这样能确保他们上班前用上。
Because doctors and nurses at the hospital usually hand in at six in the morning, we try to get them there before the shift so that they can use them before work.
一开始在仙桃做基地的时候，我住在一个小宾馆，结果没几天宾馆被举报了，说有武汉来的人。
At the beginning of the peach base, I lived in a small hotel, but a few days later the hotel was reported to have people from Wuhan.
那个宾馆的老板人很好，我住了几天，没有收我房费。
The owner of the hotel is very kind. I stayed for a few days and didn't charge me for the room.
所以被举报了，我也不想给老板添麻烦，就带着被子在自己车上睡了几天。
So was reported, I also do not want to cause trouble to the boss, took a quilt in his car sleep for a few days.
反正我当时每天睡觉不超过三小时，就算睡觉了手机上还是一直被各种信息“轰炸”。
After all, I did not sleep more than three hours a day, even after sleeping on the mobile phone has been "bombed" by all kinds of information.
从那时候开始，我算是正式开始了志愿者的工作。
Since then, I've been officially engaged as a volunteer.
到现在快一个月了，身边有一些人中途退出了，我想说不能怪别人，我非常理解，因为这些完全是无回报的事。
It's been almost a month now and some of the people around me have dropped out. I want to say I can't blame anyone else.
有人说，负担不起油费，去跑货拉拉赚钱去了。
Some people say that they can't afford to pay for fuel and go shopping and make money.
就我个人而言，这段时间的油费已经上万了，这些都是我自己出的。
Personally, I've spent tens of thousands of dollars on fuel, and it's all my own fault.
但我中间不能接受的是，有一天在一个志愿者车队群里，我被人怀疑，说我倒卖物资。
But what I can't accept is that one day in a convoy of volunteers, I was suspected of selling supplies.
我不知道为什么会有人这样看我，我送的物资都是直接到武汉的医院，根本不经过私人仓库之类。
I do not know why people think of me like this, I send goods are directly to the hospital in Wuhan, not through the private warehouse and so on.
所以当时我心里很不好受，这么忙还要被人这样怀疑，心想在家呆着不好吗？于是，我就在家休了两天，结果发现已经完全不行，无法休息。
So I felt very uncomfortable, so busy and so suspected, thinking that it was not good to stay at home, so I took two days off at home, only to find that I was completely exhausted and unable to rest.
每天一觉醒来，看到微信上那些求助信息，我觉得在家没有一点意义，又出去“重操旧业”。
I wake up every day, see the message on the message of help, I feel no sense at home, and go out to "resume business."
从第一次去到现在，仙桃那边捐赠物资的对象各种各样，有个人，也有公司，还有商会、基金会。
From the first time to the present, Xiantao donated materials to a variety of individuals, companies, but also chambers of commerce, foundations.
不过我也不管他们具体是谁，只要你是有东西要捐给医院，那我就负责给你送到。
But I don't care who they are. If you have anything to donate to the hospital, I'll take care of it.
其实疫情面前，团队什么的不重要，你就是做事，你属于什么团队重要吗？我觉得我就像一块砖，哪里需要我就往哪填。
In fact, the epidemic, the team or what is not important, you are doing things, you belong to what team? I feel like a brick, where I need to fill in.
这么多天，往返仙桃和武汉，以及湖北其他地区的公路上，我有时候也觉得孤独。
For so many days, I sometimes feel lonely traveling to and from Xiantao and Wuhan, as well as on highways in other parts of Hubei Province.
配送过程中，有时候我连两头的人都没见到。
Sometimes I don't even see people at either end of the distribution.
把货物搬上车，清点完毕，再送到目的地，搬下车，让对方签收，我的工作就完成了。
Get the goods on board, count them out, get them to your destination, get out of the car, get them signed, and get my work done.
那些收货的医院，顶多知道送货的司机叫赵勐，至于赵勐是谁，他们也不知道。
Those receiving the hospital, at best know that the delivery driver named Zhao Mone, as for who Zhao Mone is, they also do not know.
送往武汉市中心医院物资的签单前几天，志愿者联盟的邓先生让我统计这段时间我送了多少货，说实话我也不知道具体送了多少吨。
A few days before sending the materials to Wuhan Central Hospital, Mr. Deng of the Volunteer League asked me to count how much I had delivered during this time.
反正我的车每天至少一趟来回。
Anyway, my car comes and goes at least once a day.
我那辆小货车满载的话是4吨。
My van is full of four tons.
4吨换成防护服或者口罩，就是8000套防护服，或者30万只口罩。
Switch from 4 tons to protective clothing or masks, that is, 8,000 suits, or 300,000 face masks.
有一天下午，我和邓先生接到消息，说有个厂家提供了一批消毒液。
One afternoon, Mr. Deng and I received word that a disinfectant had been supplied by a manufacturer.
一开始我们并不知道到底有多少，开着车就去了。
At first we didn't know how much it was, so we drove off.
到了才发现，原来有9吨消毒液，一共360桶。
It turned out that there were nine tons of disinfectant, totalling 360 barrels.
没有其他人帮忙，我们俩一箱箱搬上货车，搬了整整六小时，从下午三点搬到晚上八点多。
Without help from anyone else, the two of us loaded our vans and moved for six hours, from 3 p.m. to more than 8 p.m.
搬完后，我们两个人累得腰都直不起来。
After we finished moving, we were both so tired that we couldn't straighten up.
Play我大多数时候都是一个人干活，所以几乎没有什么“工作照”。
I work alone most of the time, so there are almost no "work photos."
又有什么时间拍照呢？忙的时候根本想不起来拍照片。
What's the time to take a picture? I can't even remember when I'm busy.
这些我都无所谓的，我也不是想证明什么。
I don't care. I'm not trying to prove anything.
经过这次疫情，我对《我不是药神》这部电影感触特别深。
After the outbreak, I was particularly impressed with the movie "I'm not a pharmacist."
我明白了平时物资储存的重要性，这样在特殊时期才能派上大用场。
I've learned the importance of stocking up on a regular basis so that it can be put to good use in special times.
现在我在我们小区里的菜鸟驿站准备了一些防护服和口罩，我告诉住在小区或者附近的医护人员，只要提供相关的工作证明，我就免费送给你们。
Now that I've prepared some protective clothing and masks at the rookie station in our neighborhood, I'm telling the staff who live in or near the neighborhood that I'll give them away for free, provided they provide proof of their work.
