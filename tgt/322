All patients were wearing masks and medical staff were wearing special anti-virus masks.
其间，一名医生反复提醒医护人员和患者戴好口罩，“后面有一例要排查。
During the visit, a doctor repeatedly reminded paramedics and patients to wear masks.
”对于该病患情况，医生表示，医院已经启动筛查，“目前只要是从武汉回来，且有发热症状的患者都要排查，这是防控方案要求的。
Doctors say the hospital has started screening for the patient. "Anyone who returns from Wuhan and has fever symptoms should be screened, as required by the control plan.
”一名患者的化验单，检测项目与普通发热就诊的化验项目一致。
"Assay sheet for one patient showed the same test items as regular fever visits.
新京报记者姜慧梓摄接诊时，医生口头询问发热患者最近三周是否有外出旅行或居住史。
When the Beijing News reporter Jiang Huizi attended the clinic, the doctor asked the feverish patients if they had any travel or residence history in the past three weeks.
从开具的血象化验科目来看，为血象检查和采集咽拭子等呼吸道标本，以及甲流、乙流病毒检测，与普通发热就诊的化验项目并无二致。
In terms of blood imaging studies, respiratory specimens such as blood imaging examination and collection of swabs, as well as influenza A and B virus detection, are the same as those for routine fever visits.
对此，医生表示，目前主要排查武汉回京的发热病例，但近期感冒多发，普通发热病例也较以往更多。
In this regard, doctors said that at present, the main screening Wuhan back to Beijing fever cases, but the recent cold, common fever cases are more than ever.
从血象报告可以判断疑似新型冠状病毒病例吗？医生表示，血象报告仅是一个参考，排查新型冠状病毒需要更多指标。
Can we judge the suspected new coronavirus case from the blood imaging report? The doctor said the blood imaging report is only a reference and more indicators are needed to scan the new coronavirus.
一名护士告诉新京报记者，北京通报发现两例新型冠状病毒后，当天发热门诊的就诊人数并未激增，“但也有人来为查个放心。
A nurse told the Beijing News that two new coronavirus cases were reported in Beijing. The number of people attending the fever clinic did not surge that day.
”有患者表示，自己已经快好了，但以防万一还是过来检查一下。
Some patients said they were almost ready, but had come to check them out in case.
香港1月21日起武汉来港航班旅客须填健康申报表针对湖北武汉出现的新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎情况，1月20日，香港食物及卫生局召开记者会通报最新情况，香港目前未有确诊病例，监测措施在不断加强，1月21日起从武汉来港航班旅客须填写健康申报表。
The Food and Health Bureau announced at a press conference on January 20 that no confirmed cases had been confirmed in Hong Kong. Monitoring measures have been stepped up. Travellers arriving from Wuhan on January 21 are required to complete a health declaration form.
新京报记者此前在香港探访发现，香港多所大学提醒师生做好个人卫生防护措施。
An earlier visit to Hong Kong by the Beijing News revealed that many universities in Hong Kong have reminded students and teachers to take personal health protection measures.
在记者会上，香港食物及卫生局局长陈肇始表示，截至1月20日8时，香港未有确诊病例，怀疑个案（即疑似病例）有106宗，病人年龄在1岁至67岁之间。
At a press conference, the Secretary for Food and Health, Mr Chan Siu-kwong, said there were no confirmed cases in Hong Kong as at 0800 hours on January 20. There were 106 suspected cases (i.e. suspected cases) of patients between the ages of 1 and 67.
所有呈报个案当中，有20人住院，其中18人情况稳定，而另两名一人危殆，一人严重。
Of the total number of reported cases, 20 were hospitalized, of whom 18 were in stable condition, while two others were in critical condition and one was in critical condition.
陈肇始说，对新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎，香港当局采取的监控手段不断加强，原来只是曾到武汉并有病征人士需要被呈报，但现在，标准扩大到曾前往湖北省并有病征人士。
Mr Chan said Hong Kong authorities had stepped up surveillance of pneumonia in the new coronavirus infection. Those who had travelled to Wuhan and had symptoms had to be reported. However, the standard has now been extended to those who have travelled to Hubei Province and are suffering from symptoms.
1月21日起，所有从武汉到港航班的旅客均要填写健康申报表，留下联系方式，方便追踪。
From January 21, all passengers arriving from Wuhan will be required to fill out a health declaration form, leaving contact details to facilitate tracking.
卫生署署长陈汉仪表示，此健康申报表暂时仅适用于飞机旅客，这是考虑到可操作性问题。
The Director of Health, Mrs Pamela Tan, said the declaration was only applicable to air travellers for the time being because of operational considerations.
因为若各个口岸的内地旅客都要填申报表，“大量的人在一个时段（滞留）在一个空气不是那么流通的地方，对控制传染病未必是最理想的。
For if Mainland passengers at all ports are required to fill in a declaration form, "a large number of people (stranded) in a place where the air is not so circulating may not be ideal for controlling infectious diseases."
”他同时表示，目前高铁口岸已增加手提仪器探测体温。
"Hand-held equipment has been added to detect body temperature at the high-speed rail crossing, he said.
此前，香港特区政府已针对新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎启动“严重”应变级别，即三级（戒备、严重及紧急）之中的第二级。
Earlier, the Hong Kong SAR Government had activated the "severe" strain level, the second of three (alert, severe and emergency) levels, for pneumonia associated with a new coronavirus infection.
此外，香港已于1月8日刊宪，将“严重新型传染性病原体呼吸系统病”纳入《预防及控制疾病条例》下须法定呈报的传染病，并在当日生效。
In addition, Hong Kong gazetted on January 8 the "Severe New Infectious Pathogen Respiratory Disease" as a notifiable infectious disease under the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance, with effect from that date.
因此，如果已受感染或怀疑已受感染的病人不肯合作，比如拒绝接受隔离或拒绝进行检疫，香港卫生部门有权力对其采取强制措施。
Therefore, if a patient who is infected or suspected to be infected refuses to cooperate, such as refusing isolation or refusing to undergo quarantine, Hong Kong's health authorities have the power to impose compulsory measures on them.
1月13日，在国家卫健委的安排下，香港食物及卫生局副局长徐德义和卫生署及医院管理局代表，曾前往武汉了解武汉肺炎病例群组个案的情况、防控措施和临床处理。
On January 13, the Deputy Secretary for Food and Health, Mr Tsui Tak-yee, and representatives of the Department of Health and the Hospital Authority visited Wuhan to learn about the situation, control measures and clinical management of the Wuhan Pneumonia Cluster.
