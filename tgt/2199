作者 | 第一财经马晓华突然闯入武汉的新冠病毒，给中国带来了一场非常战“疫”。
First Finance & amp; Finance Ma Xiaohua suddenly broke into Wuhan's new crown virus, bringing China a very aggressive epidemic.
2月22日，距离武汉市卫健委发布“不明原因肺炎”的第一则通报（2019年12月31日），仅仅52天。
Feb. 22, just 52 days after Wuhan's health committee issued its first notice of "unspecified pneumonia" (December 31, 2019).
但是病例数，已经从最初与华南海鲜市场相关的27个病例，猛增至全国的7万多例。
But the number of cases has surged from the original 27 cases associated with the South China seafood market to more than 70,000 nationwide.
截至2月22日24时，全国累计报告确诊病例76936例，累计死亡病例2442例。
As of 2400 hours on February 22, a cumulative total of 76,936 confirmed cases and 2,442 cumulative deaths had been reported nationwide.
作为一种新发传染病，新冠病毒来到武汉之初，人类的确对它一无所知，对它是否具有传染性，对它的传播途径及传播速度的了解也很有限。
As a new infectious disease, when the new crown virus came to Wuhan, people really knew nothing about it, whether it was contagious, how it spread and how fast it spread.
但是，不代表没有防控的机会。
However, it does not mean that there are no control opportunities.
曾参与了最初流行病学调查（下称“流调”）的工作人员、曾多次参与传染病调查的专家，都向第一财经记者表示，武汉疫情之初，曾错失3个关键的时间窗口。
Staff involved in the initial epidemiological investigation (hereinafter referred to as the "drift"), and experts who have participated in the investigation of infectious diseases on many occasions, told the first financial reporter that Wuhan had missed three key time windows at the beginning of the epidemic.
一：华南市场的人和物2019年12月30日晚，网传一份“武汉市卫健委”发布的紧急通知：关于做好不明原因肺炎救治工作的紧急通知，明确指出“我市部分医疗机构陆续出现了不明原因肺炎病人”， 这份通知为“有效做好此类病人医疗救治工作”而发。
First: People and objects in the South China market December 30, 2019, a network of "Wuhan City Health Commission" issued an emergency notice: do not do well in the treatment of pneumonia, clearly state that "some medical institutions in my city have been suffering from unknown causes of pneumonia," the notice issued to "effectively do a good job of medical treatment for such patients.
“不明原因肺炎”这个名词，是SARS之后，当时的国家卫生部为了更好地及时发现和处理SARS、人禽流感以及其他表现类似、具有一定传染性的肺炎而提出的。
The term "unspecified pneumonia" was coined by the then Ministry of Health after SARS in order to better detect and treat SARS, human avian influenza and other pneumonia with similar and somewhat contagious manifestations.
从严格意义上来说，它不是一个严谨的医学概念，但作为筛选SARS、人禽流感等具有一定特殊临床表现和一定传染性的一类肺炎还是有意义的，也有助于及时发现可疑病例，早期预警并采取相应的防控措施，及早防范。
Strictly speaking, it is not a rigorous medical concept, but as a screening SARS, human avian influenza and other special clinical manifestations and a certain infectious pneumonia is still meaningful, but also help to detect suspicious cases in a timely manner, early warning and corresponding preventive measures, early prevention.
但是，这一措施并没有在武汉起到相应的预警作用。
However, this measure did not play a corresponding early warning role in Wuhan.
“最早的病例上报是在2019年12月26日，这个信息通过区、市到了省级相关部门。
"The first cases were reported on December 26, 2019, and the information passed through the district and city to the provincial level.
同时金银潭医院把样本送到合作的第三方检测公司，结果在12月30日就出来了，是冠状病毒，但不知道是哪一类。
At the same time, the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital sent the samples to a co-operative third-party testing company. It turned out to be coronavirus on Dec.
”一位自始至终一直在新冠病毒流调现场的工作人员对第一财经记者表示。
A staff member who has been at the scene of the new cap virus transfer from start to finish told the first financial reporter.
他说，“对于我们搞传染病的人来讲，一个初步的认识就是它可能具有传染性，这是冠状病毒的特点。
"For those of us who are dealing with infectious diseases, a preliminary understanding is that it may be infectious," he said.
”2019年12月30日，他来到华南海鲜市场开展流调，直观的感受是：这里通风不好、潮湿，环境极为恶劣。
On December 30, 2019, he came to the South China seafood market to begin a flow, with the intuitive feeling that it was poorly ventilated, humid and extremely hostile.
“这个市场本来有个通风系统，但已经多年没有用了，进去半个小时就会感到闷。
"There used to be a ventilation system in this market, but it hasn't been used for years, and going in for half an hour can be boring.
如果这个病起源于这里，还具有传染性的话，一定会在这个空间传播。
If the disease originates here and is contagious, it will spread in this space.
”这位流调人员说，考虑到每到周末这个市场的人流量能达到10万，所以从传染病防控的角度，最初的判断是，需要控制这个市场。
Given that there are 100,000 people in the market by the end of the week, the initial verdict, from an infectious-disease perspective, was that the market needed to be controlled, the source said.
随后，他提出了建议：封闭市场，并且对市场里所有商户进行隔离。
He then proposed closing the market and isolating all businesses in it.
▲几家关闭的店铺，附近店员说是此前销售野味的店铺2019年12月31日，武汉市卫健委发布的通报称：目前所有病例均已隔离治疗，密切接触者的追踪调查和医学观察正在进行中，对华南海鲜城的卫生学调查和环境卫生处置正在进行中。
Several closed shops, a nearby shop said it had been selling game store on December 31, 2019, Wuhan city health committee issued a notice said: All cases have been isolated treatment, close contacts tracking and medical observation is under way, the South China Sea City sanitary investigation and disposal is under way.
2020年1月1日，华南海鲜市场休市。
On January 1, 2020, the South China seafood market closed.
1月3日，武汉市卫健委发布公告称，疫情发生后，国家和省卫生健康委高度重视，派出工作组和专家组赴武汉市，指导当地开展疫情应对和处置工作。
On January 3, Wuhan Health Commission issued a notice saying that after the outbreak of the epidemic, the State and provincial health committees attached great importance to sending working groups and expert groups to Wuhan city to guide local efforts to deal with the epidemic.
武汉市卫健委在全市医疗机构开展相关病例搜索和回顾性调查，已完成对华南海鲜城的环境卫生处置工作，进一步的卫生学调查正在进行中。
The Wuhan Health Commission has carried out relevant case search and retrospective investigation in medical institutions throughout the city, and completed the disposal of environmental sanitation in Hai Xian City, South China. Further sanitary investigation is underway.
1月5日，武汉市卫健委再发通报称，在国家和湖北省的支持下，已经采取7方面防控措施：一是全力救治患者。
On January 5, Wuhan city health committee issued a circular, with the support of the state and Hubei Province, has adopted seven aspects of prevention and control measures: First, full treatment of patients.
二是对所有病例均开展隔离治疗。
The other is to provide isolated treatment for all cases.
三是继续在全市医疗机构开展相关病例搜索和回顾性调查。
Third, continue to conduct relevant case search and retrospective investigation in medical institutions throughout the city.
四是认真开展密切接触者追踪，对已经追踪到的密切接触者按规定落实医学观察，目前没有发现发热等异常症状。
Fourthly, follow-up of close contacts should be carried out conscientiously, and medical observation should be carried out according to regulations for those in close contact who have been traced.
五是对华南海鲜城采取休市措施，并开展环境卫生处置和进一步的卫生学调查。
Fifth, the South China Sea Fresh City to take measures, and carry out environmental health disposal and further hygiene investigation.
六是积极开展流行病学调查。
Sixthly, actively carry out epidemiological investigation.
七是配合国家和省开展病原鉴定（包括核酸检测和病毒分离培养）和病因溯源，防控工作正有序进行。
Seven is to cooperate with the national and provincial pathogen identification (including nucleic acid testing and virus isolation culture) and etiology traceability, the control work is proceeding in an orderly manner.
但防控，其实并不那么有序。
But control, in fact, is not so orderly.
“既然已经初步查到是冠状病毒，就应该警觉，立即封闭市场，隔离所有商户，销毁所有产品。
"Now that the coronavirus has been preliminarily detected, we should be vigilant and immediately close the market, isolate all merchants and destroy all products.
但并没有这样做，华南海鲜市场属于半关，商户都走了，商品也流了出去。
But did not do so, the South China seafood market is half-closed, merchants have left, goods flow out.
”这位流调人员表示。
"said the transfer.
为什么当初不应该放走商户和商品呢？“因为我们在流调时发现，发病的患者并不是卖野生动物的，而是离野生动物摊位有一定距离的其他摊位。
Why shouldn't we have let the merchants and the goods go? Because we found out in the transfer that the patients were not selling wild animals, but other stalls that were some distance away from the wildlife stalls.
一共13个摊位的销售人员患病，而且还不是紧挨着的摊位。
Sales staff at a total of 13 stalls were ill and were not immediately adjacent to the booth.
”该流调工作人员说，由此可以判断，病毒一定在这个空间传播，虽然当时还没有更多证据证明病毒的传染性，但人传人有可能性，也存在病毒已经交叉传染到其他商品上的可能性。
The transfer staff said the virus must have spread through the space, and although there was no further evidence of its infectivity, it was possible from person to person that the virus had crossed over to other commodities.
他表示，从流行性传染病的防控来讲，应该遵循“疑是从是”的原则——不管是不是人传人的病毒，第一步也要对华南海鲜市场的商户和商品进行处置。
In terms of epidemic prevention and control, he said, it should follow the principle of "yes or no" - the first step is to dispose of businesses and commodities in the South China seafood market, whether human-to-human or not.
▲2月16日，一名市民和一名外卖员在武汉市中北路上擦肩而过 。
February 16, a citizen and a take-out in Wuhan City on the north-central road brush past.
新华社图流调还发现，病毒的第一波传播是在2019年12月22日到26日左右，所以市场的商户需要隔离。
The Xinhua news agency also found that the first wave of transmission of the virus occurred around December 22 to 26 2019, so businesses in the market need to be isolated.
这一发现，在2月17日中国疾控中心的一篇论文《新型冠状病毒肺炎流行病学特征分析》中得到印证：2019年12月31日之前，已经有104人发病。
This finding was confirmed in a February 17 CDC paper, "Epidemiological Analysis of New Coronavirus Pneumonia": 104 people had developed the disease by December 31, 2019.
不过，最基本的信息上报之后，并没有引起相关部门的注意。
However, the most basic information reported, did not attract the attention of the relevant departments.
由于没有从科学上找到“病原体”，这些碎片化的信息并没有让相关政府部门当即采取全面封锁市场的措施，进而放走了大批传染源。
In the absence of a scientific "pathogen," the fragmented information did not prompt the authorities to take immediate steps to shut down the market altogether, freeing up a large number of sources of infection.
早发现、早报告、早隔离、早治疗是控制新发传染病流行的最有力措施，所以世界卫生组织（WHO）曾建议对于新发传染病要采取早期的围堵政策，用医学和非医学（区域封锁、停学和停工等）干预策略和措施，迅速阻断疫情传播。
Early detection, early reporting, early isolation, and early treatment are the most powerful measures to control the spread of new infectious diseases, so the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended an early containment policy for new infectious diseases, using both medical and non-medical intervention strategies and measures (regional blockades, school suspensions, stoppages, etc.) to rapidly halt the spread of the epidemic.
但是，对于新冠病毒蔓延的早期，武汉错误了第一次围堵机会，遏制病毒的“机会之窗”开始缩小。
But, in the early days of the new crown virus, Wuhan missed its first opportunity to block it, and the "window of opportunity" to contain it began to narrow.
二：医务感染和人传人围绕防控新冠病毒，最初的决策一直在等待科学的研究结果：病毒是什么，是否人传人。
Second: Medical infections and human-to-human transmission of the new crown virus, the original decision-making has been awaiting scientific research on what the virus is and whether it can be passed on from person to person.
由于一直在等待病原体的检测结果，2019年12月30日的“类似冠状病毒”的检测报告并没有影响到决策。
The report of December 30, 2019, "coronavirus-like" did not affect decision-making, as the results of testing for the pathogen were awaited.
“对于冠状病毒，至少要第一时间提醒老百姓，它的传播距离是5米，需要佩戴口罩。
"For coronavirus, at least the first time to remind the common people, its transmission distance is 5 meters, need to wear a mask.
也需要考虑气溶胶可以传播到20公里以外。
It also needs to be considered that aerosols can travel more than 20 km.
政府部门可能需要时间研究，需要开会决策，但是防控措施不能拖延，否则就是一个大雷。
Government departments may need time to study and meet to make decisions, but control measures must not be delayed, or else it will be a big minefield.
”一位病毒学家在1月3日时表示。
A virologist said on January 3.
在尚未有答案的等待期，新冠病毒在开始快速蔓延。
The new crown virus is beginning to spread fast in a waiting period that has not been answered.
“从1月1日起，武汉医疗机构的门诊、诊所发热患者增多。
"Since January 1, the number of fever cases in outpatient clinics and clinics in Wuhan medical institutions has increased.
但当时还没有诊断试剂，没有专业指导，医护防护也不到位。
However, there were no diagnostic reagents, no professional guidance and no medical protection in place.
武汉三甲医院的三级防护设备都不多，更不用说二级医院和诊所了——他们只有隔离衣和口罩。
Wuhan Sanjia Hospital has few tertiary protective equipment, not to mention level II hospitals and clinics - all they have are protective clothing and masks.
”上述流调人员表示，最早的医护感染出现在1月7日左右。
The source said the first medical infection appeared on or about January 7.
“这个时候已经显现了人传人的迹象。
"The time has come to show signs of human-to-human transmission.
当时有两个诊所的医生被感染，但是由于没有确诊，也没法上报。
Doctors at two clinics were infected but were unable to report it because they were not diagnosed.
”流调人员了解到的基层真实信息，藏匿在背后。
The real grass-roots information that the diasporas learn is hidden behind their backs.
公开的信息中，新冠肺炎的病例数仍止步不前。
According to public information, the number of cases of New Crown Pneumonia remains stagnant.
而且在2019年12月31日、2020年1月3日、5日、11日的四则通报中，武汉市卫健委明确告诉公众“未发现明确的人传人证据，未发现医务人员感染”。
Moreover, in four circulars, dated 31 December 2019 and on 3, 5 and 11 January 2020, the Wuhan Health Care Commission explicitly informed the public that "no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission has been found and no medical personnel have been found to have contracted the infection."
后期大量回顾性信息，显然不支持这一结论。
The large amount of retrospective information at a later stage clearly does not support this conclusion.
比如，“字节跳动医务基金”的名单显示，华中科技大学同济医学院附属同济医院陆医生于1月7日确诊。
For example, the list of byte-beating medical funds showed that Dr. Lu of Tongji Hospital, affiliated with Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, was diagnosed on January 7.
不过，上述流调人员表示，当时诸多信息确实都很碎片化，如果不能及时发现，决策层很难作为决策依据。
However, the transfer said that much of the information was indeed fragmented, if not timely discovery, decision-making is difficult to use as a basis for decision.
“但从流行病学来讲，根据这些迹象是可以采取措施的，而且应该立即采取措施，才能把传染源控制起来，阻断传播。
"But epidemiologically, measures can be taken on the basis of these signs, and immediate measures should be taken to control the source of infection and block transmission."
”这位流调人员表示。
"said the transfer.
他也发现，越来越多老人去了医院，因为老人经常到超市买菜，感染的机会比其他人群要多，而医院的发热门诊也成为了交叉感染的场所。
He also found that more and more elderly people were going to hospitals because they often went to the supermarket to buy vegetables and were more likely to get infected than the rest of the population, and that the hospital's fever clinic had become a place for cross-infection.
这场大范围的传播已经开始了。
The widespread dissemination has already begun.
那么，“人传人”是如何被忽略了的呢？▲2月20日，在华中科技大学附属同济医院光谷院区，一名医护人员在即将进入病区的同事防护服上写下“热干面加油”字样。
In the Guanggu Campus of Tongji Hospital, an affiliate of the Central University of Science and Technology, a medical worker wrote "hot dry noodles to refuel" on the protective clothing of colleagues entering the sick area on Feb. 20.
新华社图1月8日，第二批国家新型冠状病毒感染肺炎专家组到达武汉，其中包括北京大学第一医院呼吸和危重症医学科主任王广发，后来他也被确诊。
A second group of experts from China's new coronavirus-infected pneumonia arrived in Wuhan on Jan. 8, including Wang Guangfa, director of respiratory and critical medicine at Peking University's First Hospital.
在接受媒体采访时，王广发说，在武汉期间掌握的资料有限，并未发现明确的人传人证据。
In an interview with the media, Wang Guangfa said the information available during Wuhan is limited, did not find clear evidence of human-to-human.
王广发表示，当时拿到的资料，就是发表在《柳叶刀》上的最初41例患者的病例。
According to Wang, the data available at the time were those of the first 41 cases published in The Lancet.
进入到病房看到的是一个个病人，没有办法掌握所有病人的情况。
Entered the ward to see a patient, there is no way to grasp the situation of all patients.
1月26日，北京中日友好医院曹彬及北京协和医学院王建伟作为共同通讯作者，在《柳叶刀》上发表了名为《武汉市2019年新型冠状病毒感染患者的临床特征》的文章，研究对象是截至1月2日的41例确诊患者。
On January 26, Cao Bin of Beijing Sino-Japanese Friendship Hospital and Wang Jianwei of Beijing Concoronavirus Medical School, as co-authors, published in The Lancet an article entitled "Clinical Characteristics of 41 Patients with New Coronavirus Infection in Wuhan 2019," which studied 41 confirmed cases as of January 2.
王广发也表示，怀疑到有人传人，也看到那些聚集性病例，但是聚集性病例可能是人传人，也有可能是聚集性暴露引起的，“根据我们当时掌握的资料，没有明确的证据显示有人传人。
Wang also said he suspects human-to-human transmission and has seen cases of aggregation, but human-to-human or aggregation is possible. "According to the information available to us at the time, there is no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.
特别是医务人员的感染。
This is particularly true of infections among medical personnel.
”“王广发说的是对的，他当时可能真的没有看到人传人的数据。
"" Wang was right. He probably didn't see data on human-to-human transmission.
”一位多次参与传染病调查的专家告诉记者，单从地方上获得的汇报资料中，无法判断人传人，其中也没有医护人员的感染情况。
An expert involved in the investigation of infectious diseases told reporters that it was impossible to judge human-to-human transmission from local sources alone, nor was there any infection among health-care workers.
“在这种情况下，只有实地继续开展临床调研，详细询问患者的病史、接触史，调查医院到底有没有医务人员感染，如果有的话，是上报了还是没法上报。
"In such cases, only clinical research continues in the field, asking patients in detail about their medical history, their history of exposure, whether they are infected by medical personnel and, if so, whether they are reported or not.
如果这些信息属实的话，就必须把真实的情况汇报上去，以便及时调整防控策略，阻止疫情蔓延。
If this information is true, the true situation must be reported so that control strategies can be adjusted in time to prevent the spread of the epidemic.
”这位专家说。
"said the expert.
这位专家还表示，真正的信息分析和研判决策，一定还要同时基于实地调查研究。
The expert also said that real information analysis and decision-making must also be based on field research.
他举例说，“作为一个上级的医生，听完下级医生的汇报以后，我要是负责任的话，就必须亲自去实地看这个病人，亲自去问病人的病史，亲自去看每个化验结果，这样我才能做一个诊断，而不是连实地调查研究都没做，就给出诊断或结论。
He gave the example of a superior doctor who, having listened to the reports of the inferior doctors, would have had to look at the patient in person, ask the patient's medical history, and see for myself the results of each test, so that I could make a diagnosis instead of making a diagnosis or finding a conclusion without even doing a field investigation.
因为年轻医生获得的信息往往会不全面，而且汇报时又把他认为不重要的信息给过滤了。
Because young doctors often get incomplete information, they filter out information they don't think is important.
”▲2月10日，王莉莉（左）和同事一起走街串巷做流行病学调查。
On February 10, Lily Wang (left) went down the street with her colleagues to do an epidemiological investigation.
新华社图显然，最初提报上来的信息，由于缺失了基层流调以及真实发生在医院里的病例，导致了信息的不全面、不客观。
It is clear from the Xinhua chart that the information initially reported was incomplete and non-objective because of the absence of grass-roots transfers and cases that actually occurred in hospitals.
而专家组当初之所以做出没有明确的人传人的判断，就是只根据提报上来的已经被过滤的信息进行研判，没有实地调查研究。
The Panel's original judgement, which is not clear from person to person, was based solely on filtered information submitted, with no field research.
缺乏重要的实地调查研究，有些专家比如王广发的判断失误就不可避免了。
In the absence of important field research, some experts such as Wang Guangfa's misjudgment are inevitable.
上述专家感叹说，“疫情之初，一些专家的判断都直接影响了决策。
"At the beginning of the epidemic, the judgment of some experts directly influenced the decision," the experts lamented.
”香港大学“新发传染性疾病国家重点实验室”主任管轶在1月中旬接受大公报采访时表示，冠状病毒最长潜伏期是15天，而自1月3日后内地无新增传染病例，可以判断此次疫情已经得到控制。
"The longest incubation period for coronavirus is 15 days," Guan Yi, director of the National Key Laboratory for Emerging Infectious Diseases at the University of Hong Kong, told a tabloid newspaper in mid-January.
从目前看，病患症状不重，即使有人传人，也非常有限。
At present, the symptoms of patients are not serious, even if there is a person-to-person, very limited.
管轶还表示，传染源清楚了，疫情也控制住了，“我们已经可以看到胜利的曙光，相信民众可以过个好年”。
Guan Yi also said that the source of infection is clear and the epidemic is under control. "We can already see the light of victory and believe people can have a good year."
当时管轶还强调，武汉疫情只有一例死亡，同时患者还有腹部肿瘤及慢性肝病。
At that time, Guan Yi also stressed that there was only one case of death in Wuhan, while the patient also had abdominal tumor and chronic liver disease.
可以判断，此次疫情与SARS不同，SARS是出现超级传播者后才出现大幅传播的，但武汉肺炎病毒与SARS相比传播性不强，同源性和相似度没有这么高。
It can be concluded that this outbreak is different from SARS, the emergence of super-transmission of SARS after the emergence of a large-scale spread, but Wuhan pneumonia virus and SARS compared with the transmission is not strong, homology and similarity so high.
他还特别指出，不要夸大病毒的传染疫情。
He also highlighted the need not to exaggerate the spread of the virus.
“这些专家的意见和言论，无疑都影响了决策，从而错过了（防控）时机。
"There is no doubt that the opinions and statements of these experts have influenced decision-making and missed the opportunity."
”上述专家表示，在国外，做决策分析时一定要基于整体信息（既不是碎片化信息，也不是来源不准确的信息），并且要进行实地调查研究。
In foreign countries, decision-making must be based on overall information (neither fragmented nor inaccurate) and on field research, the experts say.
上述专家也认为，初期的信息的确是碎片化的。
The same experts agree that the initial information is indeed fragmentary.
一个最明显的例子就是上述41个病例，如果单纯以此为基数来看，新冠病毒的致死率是很低的。
One of the most obvious examples is the 41 cases mentioned above, which, taken as a base, would result in a very low death rate for the new crown virus.
但这个结论仅是基于有限病例得出的。
But this conclusion is based only on a limited number of cases.
一些专家的不慎重研判，以及面对公众所给出的不严谨意见，不仅误导了公众，也影响了决策。
The imprudent judgment of some experts and the lax opinions given by the public have not only misled the public but also influenced decision-making.
毕竟，权威专家的意见，是要考虑进去的。
After all, the opinions of authoritative experts should be taken into account.
由此，“人传人”的信息没有被及时传递出，导致必要的全民防控没有实施。
As a result, the "person-to-person" message was not transmitted in a timely manner, resulting in the necessary national control not being implemented.
但病毒，依然在快速蔓延。
But the virus is still spreading fast.
直到1月20日，钟南山院士在接受采访时表示，存在人传人，已经有医护感染。
Until Jan. 20, academician Zhong Nan Shan said in an interview that there is human-to-human transmission, there are already medical infections.
于是，新冠肺炎的正式防控战 “打响”。
As a result, the new crown pneumonia of the formal prevention and control war "started."
1月20日，国家卫健委发布1号公告，将新冠肺炎纳入《中华人民共和国传染病防治法》规定的乙类传染病，并采取甲类传染病的预防、控制措施。
On January 20, the State Health Council issued Notice No. 1, adding the new crown pneumonia to the Class B infectious diseases stipulated in the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases, and adopted measures for the prevention and control of Class A infectious diseases.
但此时，根据中国疾控中心的回顾性研究，实际发病人数已经达到6174例。
But by this time, according to a retrospective study by the China CDC, the actual number of cases had reached 6,174.
三：封城后社区失守随着中国科学家对新冠病毒的认识越来越深入，对病毒的传播力和致病特点越来越明确，相关部门经过综合研判，提出了在武汉和湖北部分地区实施围堵策略的建议。
Third: After the closure of the city the community lost ground As the knowledge of Chinese scientists on the new crown virus, the transmission of the virus and the characteristics of the increasingly clear-cut, the relevant departments through comprehensive assessment, in Wuhan and parts of Hubei put forward the implementation of containment strategy.
1月23日，武汉封城。
Wuhan Sealed on January 23.
但随后，武汉一时失序：因为市内交通切断，居家隔离的发热患者不能抵达医院；因为医院床位紧张，医疗资源透支，医疗防护用品短缺，患者得不到有效救治，进而诱发了交叉感染......“武汉的战疫，战场不仅在急救的医疗场所，更在可能发生传染的所有场所，防控的最终目标是做到控源、隔离、减增量。
But then, Wuhan temporarily disorderly: because of the city's traffic cut-off, isolated fever patients can not reach hospitals, because hospital beds, overstretched medical resources, shortage of medical supplies, patients do not have effective treatment... "Wuhan epidemic, not only in emergency medical sites, but also in all places where possible infection, the ultimate goal of prevention and control is to control, isolate, reduce incremental.
”中央指导组社区防控基层专家组负责人吴浩接受第一财经采访时表示，从战略上看，必须尽快以一个一个社区为单位、网格式管理、联防联控，从而控制疫情。
"From a strategic point of view, we need to control the epidemic through community-by-community, web-based format management and joint control as soon as possible," Wu Hao, the director of the Central Steering Group's grass-roots group of experts on community prevention and control, told Financial One.
他表示，从预警、防控到救治，公共卫生实际上一个整体系统。
He said, from early warning, prevention and treatment, public health is actually a whole system.
“前方支援了很多精兵强将，但是如果不把防控关口前移，后方也会源源不断往医疗战场上输送病人。
"There are a lot of good guys in the front, but if we don't move forward, we're going to have a constant flow of patients on the medical battlefield."
”在传染性疫情的防控体系中，社区是预防和分诊的第一道防线。
The community is the first line of defense for prevention and treatment of infectious diseases.
社区的防控效果，直接关乎防疫战的成败。
The effect of community control is directly related to the success or failure of epidemic prevention.
2月6日，吴浩作为基层新型冠状病毒感染防控专家组来到武汉。
February 6, Wu Hao as the grass-roots new coronavirus infection prevention and control team to Wuhan.
“这里很安静，基本上看不到战争的氛围，但超市满是人。
"It was quiet, almost invisible, but the supermarket was full of people.
我们到了小区，看到也有部分人不戴口罩，我们感觉完了。
We went to the neighborhood and saw some of the people were not wearing masks. We felt like we were done.
你派多少将士在前方做前锋也不行，你的后卫控源没有解决。
How many soldiers do you send forward is not enough, your point guard control is not resolved.
居家隔离指导不到位，学校隔离指导不到位，培训机制没有做好，培训指南不是发下来就行了，得学、得有人解读，没人解读，根本不知道怎么做。
Home isolation guidance is not in place, school segregation guidance is not in place, training mechanisms are not in place, and training guidelines are not just for distribution, but for learning, interpretation, interpretation and simply do not know what to do.
