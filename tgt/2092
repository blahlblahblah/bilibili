摘要：她们曾为城市做出过看似微小但却关键性的贡献，值得在退休后得到来自社会的助力与尊重，她们的困境，也值得在春暖花开、疫情驱散后继续被审视与关注。
They have made a seemingly small but crucial contribution to the city and deserve the help and respect of society when they retire. Their plight deserves continued scrutiny and attention after the outbreak has spread.
谁都绝不会想到，庚子鼠年的这个春节会是如此焦虑且悲壮。
No one would have thought that the Gengzi Year of the Rat this Spring Festival will be so anxious and solemn.
线上炽热，线下安静。
Hot on the line, quiet under the line.
整个民族又到了万众一心众志成城的时刻。
The whole nation has reached the moment of unity of purpose.
即使在这个真假善恶齐飞的非常时刻，有些日常的、线下的刚需也依然存在。
Even at this very moment of truth and falsehood, some daily, offline needs still exist.
比如家政。
Like home economics.
以下，是三位家政大姐的春节返工故事。
The following is the Spring Festival rework story of three housewives.
本文照片均由鸿雁之家提供眼镜口罩手套都准备好了2月5日，农历正月十二，程大姐一大早就在朋友圈里发出了北京飘雪的小视频。
All the photos in this article are prepared by Hongyan House. On February 5, the twelfth of the first month of the lunar month, Cheng sent out a video of snow in Beijing early in the morning.
她刚从四川回到北京返工。
She has just returned from Sichuan to Beijing for rework.
距离1月18日回家，在老家她只住了不到三周。
She was back home on January 18th, living in her hometown for less than three weeks.
回京的一路上，“眼镜口罩手套都准备好了，我也不吃饭不跟人说话”。
On the way back to Beijing, "I have my eyeglass gloves ready and I don't eat or talk to anyone."
听得出她对疫情发展还是有些恐慌。
I can tell she's still a little nervous about the outbreak.
“但越早走还好一点，越晚走人越多。
"But it's better to go earlier, the later you leave.
”她说。
'she said.
早在95、96年，程大姐就辞别家乡北上打工，中间她回乡生养过孩子，也南下广东打过工，但“因为适应不了那边太热的气候”，又辗转回到了北京。
As early as 95, 96, Cheng took leave of her hometown to work in the north, where she returned home to raise children and work in Guangdong Province, but "unable to adapt to the hot weather there," she toiled back to Beijing.
节前，她有两份小时工工作，上午下午各一家，每天从早上六点半忙到晚上八点半，虽然辛苦但相对稳定。
Before the festival, she had two hours' work, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, busy from 6: 30 in the morning to 8: 30 in the evening, although hard but relatively stable.
但这个春节，在她还没返京时，疫情就以一种间接的方式让她丢掉了一份工作。
But this Spring Festival, before she returned to Beijing, the epidemic caused her to lose a job in an indirect way.
“下午这家是做旅游业的。
"" This is for the tourist industry this afternoon.
他们告诉我，（因为疫情对旅游业的影响），就先不用人了；再需要人（家政服务人员），至少也要半年以后了。
They told me (because of the impact of the epidemic on the tourism industry) that people would not be needed for the first time, and that it would take at least six months.
”因为疫情，以旅游、餐饮、酒店等行业为代表的线下行业受到直接波及，相关行业从业人员或将面临暂时无工可做或收入减少的困境。
Because of the epidemic, the offline industry, represented by tourism, catering and hotels, has been directly affected, and workers in related industries may face temporary job losses or reduced incomes.
与此同时，为防控疫情，全国范围内有些地区已提倡“适当减少家政消费”。
At the same time, to prevent and control the epidemic, some areas across the country have advocated "appropriate reduction of domestic consumption."
谈及这些，程大姐只是有些无奈地说：“（有）影响也没办法。
Talk about these, Cheng elder sister is just a little helpless to say: "(have) influence also have no way."
”在程大姐的家政职业生涯中，最让她骄傲的，是做育儿嫂的时光。
In her career as a homemaker, Cheng prides herself on her time as a Sister-in-Law.
“我把五个小孩带上了幼儿园！”她脱口而出：“现在最小的都十一二岁了！”眼下，程大姐骨子里也依然还是想要工作的。
"I took five kids to kindergarten!" She blurted out, "Now the youngest is eleven or twelve!" For the moment, Cheng still wants to work.
她还想靠自己的双手做些什么，她也还有一些家庭负担。
She wanted to do something with her own hands, and she also had some family responsibilities.
2016年，她的丈夫不幸去世。
In 2016, her husband sadly passed away.
靠着坚强和勤劳，她独自抚养大儿子，还在前年回老家买了新房。
Relying on her strength and hard work, she raised her eldest son alone and bought a new house back home the year before last.
现在，程大姐的儿子长大了，但还需要赚一些新房装修的钱。
Now, Cheng's son has grown up, but still needs to earn some money to renovate the new house.
失去了一份小时工工作，就意味着失去了一份收入。
Losing a part-time job means losing an income.
非常时期，无处可怨，再想上新一份工，也并不容易。
Unusual time, nowhere to complain, and to think of a new job, is not easy.
“服务行业，就是（只在）用你的时候给工资。
"Service industry" is to pay wages when you are used.
”想早日还乡陪爸妈家在四川的刘大姐说，她最近的户外放风，也顶多是“在老家新修的水泥路上走走”。
Liu, who wants to return home with her parents in Sichuan, said her recent outdoor outing was at best a "stroll on her new concrete road back home."
她已经给自己买好了2月6日回京的火车票，不是高铁也不是快车，一共要在卧铺车厢里度过24个小时。
She had bought herself a train ticket to Beijing on February 6, not a high-speed train or an express train, and had to spend 24 hours in a sleeping car.
“快车是18个小时到，但没卧铺。
"The express was 18 hours, but there was no sleeper.
我觉得卧铺车厢人员走动少，时间长一点也没关系。
I don't think the sleeper has much walking time, it doesn't matter if it's longer.
”刘大姐今年刚过五十，1997年她来到北京，之后断断续续离京又回来，转眼就是二十多年。
"Sister Liu, who has just turned 50 this year, came to Beijing in 1997, then left Beijing intermittently and came back in a twinkling for more than 20 years.
赶在疫情爆发前，刘大姐从北京返回家乡准备过年。
Long before the outbreak of the epidemic, Liu Dajie returned home from Beijing to prepare for the New Year.
当时，她在北京的两户人家做小时工，“一家是老外，一家是外交官，他们对我都挺好”。
At the time, she worked part-time for two families in Beijing. "One was a foreigner and the other was a diplomat. They were kind to me."
短短半个月，一场疫情，让原本稳妥的工作内容开始生变。
Just half a month, an epidemic, so that the original sound work content began to change.
“老外”家计划着离开中国，还说“很多东西想留给她”；“外交官”家问她能否按时回甚至是早回来工作，家里确实缺人手。
"Foreigners" planned to leave China, saying "a lot of things to leave her," and "diplomats" asked if she would be able to return to work on time or even early.
于是，刘大姐决定早些返京，即便一路上有风险。
So Liu decided to return to Beijing earlier, even though there were risks along the way.
问她做家政有何感触，刘大姐思寻片刻说：“做家政就是最低级的（工作），其实很不容易。
Asked how she felt about home economics, Liu said for a moment: "Home economics is the lowest (work), it is not easy.
”接着她举起了例子：“年轻时没感觉，干活儿不用手套，有的住户还只能用冷水，也没想到可能得上风湿。
Then she raised the example: "When you were young, you didn't feel like you were working without gloves, you had to use cold water and you didn't think you might get rheumatism.
我从去年开始爆发，手关节变形变大，手指僵硬，我才开始买手套，干活儿时也尽量用热水。
I have had eruptions since last year, when my knuckles became deformed and my fingers became stiff. I started buying gloves and tried to use hot water when I was working.
现在的雇主，我用热水他们也不管。
Now employers, they don't care if I use hot water.
”刘大姐也想过不做家政了，或许可以做做保洁？但那“还是要碰水”。
"Sister Liu also thought not to do home economics, perhaps can do cleaning? But that" still have to touch the water. "
其他的工作，她也是想不到：在茫茫大城市的人海中，自己还能做什么。
She could not think of anything else: what else she could do in the midst of the crowds of large cities.
二十多年来，靠着她与丈夫在外的辛勤打拼，他们在老家镇上买了房，基本还清了债，儿子也长大了，经济负担减轻不少。
For more than twenty years, she and her husband worked hard outside, they bought a house in their hometown town, basically paid off the debt, son also grew up, the financial burden was reduced a lot.
多年的辛劳开始逐渐得到回报。
Years of hard work are beginning to pay off.
刘大姐也想回家了。
Sister Liu wants to go home, too.
看着父母日渐年迈，需要人照顾，她想着等把房子装修的钱还清，就真的不再做家政了。
Watching her parents grow old and need someone to take care of her, she thought of waiting for the house renovation money to pay off, really no longer do home economics.
并且，她还想好了回去做什么。
And she thought about what to go back to.
“挨着中学换套房子，卖小吃，挣个日常的钱就好”。
"Swap around the middle school, sell snacks, and earn your daily money."
她想住在靠自己打拼多年挣来的镇上新房里，多陪陪爸妈，追回年轻时那些没能抓住的家庭时光。
She wanted to live in a new town house she had worked so hard to earn for years, to stay with her parents and reclaim the family time she had missed when she was young.
我没有选择的余地十多年前，接到孩子从老家内蒙古打来的电话时，远在北京打工的何大姐经常哽咽。
I have no choice more than 10 years ago, children from the home of Inner Mongolia when the phone call, far away in Beijing often choked sister He.
“那时家中日子特别艰难，孩子电话里一要钱，我就哽咽。
"It was a tough time at home and I choked up when the kids asked for money on the phone.
家长会我也到不了……”那些年，何大姐做过许多种工作。
I can't get to the PTA either... "In those years, Sister He did many kinds of jobs.
丈夫残疾，孩子还小，家庭的重担让她不得不一直在城市里工作下去。
With a disabled husband and small children, the burden of her family forced her to work in the city all the time.
眼下，她选择了提供居家家政服务，也就是在户主家从周一“住”到周五。
For now, she has chosen to provide home help, or "stay" from Monday to Friday at the home of the head of household.
有些家政服务人员不大愿意选择住家服务，因为潜意识里会是24小时待命的精神状态，比较劳心劳神，并且难得自由。
Some domestic workers are reluctant to opt for live-in services because they are subconsciously on 24-hour standby, more demanding and rarely free.
但何大姐不大介意。
But Sister He didn't mind much.
她说：“我这个年龄，没有多少选择的余地。
"At my age, I don't have much choice," she said.
”在很多家政服务人员招聘信息里，35—45岁年龄段是最受欢迎的。
The 35-45 age bracket is the most popular type of employment for many domestic workers.
何大姐已经过了45岁，因此格外珍惜难得的工作机会。
Sister He has passed the age of 45, so she especially cherishes the rare job opportunity.
在疫情仍在蔓延的当下，城市家庭对家政服务的需求依然存在。
At a time when the epidemic is still spreading, the demand for domestic services in urban households persists.
“他家（户主）缺人手，让我这两天就过去。
"His family (the head of the family) is short of hands. Let me pass these two days.
”何大姐说，“问了我有无离开北京，我说没有。
"I asked if I had left Beijing and I said no," she said.
”这个春节，她和女儿在北京一起度过。
She spent the Spring Festival with her daughter in Beijing.
女儿也在北京打工，最近嚷嚷着想回老家发展。
Daughter also works in Beijing, recently clamour to go back home development.
何大姐也不是没想过回老家安度晚年，但她至今都还找不到一条可以走得通的路：“回去基本上没有养老保险……回去干啥都要投钱，借钱不好借，跟银行贷款吧又没抵押，投不起。
She didn't want to go back to her old age, but she still can not find a way to go: "Go back to basically no endowment insurance... go back to anything to invest money, borrowing money is not easy to borrow, with the bank loans without collateral, can not afford.
”“想回去没法办，不想回也没法办。
"You can't go back, you can't.
你说回家能干啥呢？”回不去的家乡，扎不下根的城市，加之年龄越来越大，没有什么“选择余地”的何大姐选择了活好当下，珍惜工作，及时返工。
What can you say to go home? "The hometown that cannot go home, cannot fix root city, and the elder and older, have no" choice "He elder sister chose to live well now, cherish work, timely rework.
毕竟，疫情过后，一切依然照旧。
After all, things remain the same after the epidemic.
以她为代表的整个中年家政服务人员群体的晚年困境，也依然值得在春暖花开、疫情驱散后被审视与关注。
She represented the entire group of middle-aged domestic service workers in the late years of the plight, but also worth in the spring, the epidemic dispersed after the review and attention.
她们曾为城市做出过看似微小但却关键性的贡献，值得在退休后得到来自社会的助力与尊重。
They have made seemingly small but crucial contributions to the city and deserve the help and respect of society when they retire.
（感谢北京鸿雁社工服务中心及家政工姐妹提供的帮助）延伸阅读劳动者的新年，有时充满看不见的心酸。
(Thanks to the help of Beijing Hongyan Social Work Service Centre and domestic workers and sisters), reading the workers' New Year sometimes full of unseen sadness.
