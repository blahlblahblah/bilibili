燃财经（ID:rancaijing）原创作者 | 黎明编辑 | 阿伦疫情期间，自动驾驶行业迎来了哪些新机会？3月20日，燃财经举办线上沙龙，主题聚焦自动驾驶行业，中科创星创始合伙人、联席CEO米磊，新石器创始人兼CEO余恩源，驭势科技联合创始人、董事长兼CEO吴甘沙进行了主题分享，并和燃财经总编辑贺树龙做了对话。
What are the new opportunities for the auto-driving industry during the dawn epidemic? On March 20, Founder Partner and Co-CEO of Founder and Co-CEO Miele Yu, founder and CEO of Neolithic Technologies, Wu Gansha, founder and CEO of Crossing Technologies, held a thematic sharing session with Shulong He, chief editor of Futures Finance.
米磊表示，自动驾驶行业在2019年开始降温，但随着疫情的出现，行业产生了巨大的热点，5G和新基建的投资，让无人驾驶突然迎来了一波春天。
The auto-driving industry began cooling in 2019, but with the outbreak, huge hot spots, 5G and new infrastructure investments, suddenly ushered in a spring of unmanned aerial vehicles, says Mr Milei.
他认为，对于当前的自动驾驶企业，需要做好技术到产品的落地，技术的产品化最重要。
In his view, for the current auto-driving enterprises, the need to do a good job of technology to the landing products, the most important product technology.
创业公司不要试图去跟巨头在正面战场上直接PK，而是要从边缘切入，边缘创新，集中优势兵力，在所在的细分领域做到对手两到三倍以上的资源投入，成为细分领域的龙头。
Instead of trying to directly PK the giant on the battlefield, start-up companies are cutting corners, innovating at the edges, concentrating superior forces, investing more than two or three times the resources of their competitors in their niche, and becoming the leader in the segment.
以下是米磊的分享内容：只要走过拐点，无人驾驶将迎来爆发性增长自动驾驶行业的研发最早是谷歌发起的。
Here's what Miele shared: Once past the inflection point, driverless will usher in explosive growth in the auto-driving industry was first developed by Google.
谷歌对自动驾驶非常看重，从DRAPA（美国国防部高级研究计划局）挑战赛引进了很多人才，在行业形成了标杆效应，激发了业界对自动驾驶的期待和追捧。
Google takes autopilot seriously, bringing in talent from the DRAPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) Challenge, creating a benchmarking effect in the industry that motivates the industry to look forward to and pursue automatic driving.
我在2012年就关注到，谷歌在研发无人驾驶汽车这个方向，当时就非常看好。
I had noticed in 2012 that Google was developing the driverless car, and was very bullish at the time.
因为当时我是在做光通信和光传感相关的工作，而激光雷达在无人驾驶上得到了巨大的应用。
Because I was doing optical communication and light sensing-related work, and lidar in unmanned has been a huge application.
由于人工智能技术、光电传感技术与汽车产业的结合，诞生了自动驾驶技术。
With the combination of artificial intelligence technology, photoelectric sensor technology and automobile industry, automatic driving technology was born.
2016年是中国无人驾驶元年，2017年和2018年引起了资本的巨大关注。
2016 is China's first year of unmanned aerial vehicles, and 2017 and 2018 have attracted considerable capital attention.
2019年，行业开始有一点降温。
In 2019, the industry began to cool down a bit.
但随着疫情的出现，行业一下产生了一个巨大的热点。
But with the emergence of the epidemic, the industry has a huge hot spot.
疫情导致国家在新基建的投入非常巨大，尤其是在5G、充电桩等方面，而这两个基建的投入对无人驾驶非常重要。
The epidemic has led to huge national investments in new infrastructure, particularly in 5G, charging piles, and so on, both of which are essential for unmanned systems.
无人驾驶有三个大趋势。
There are three broad trends in unmanned aerial vehicles.
一是智能化，二是网联化，三是电动化或新能源化，所以5G和充电桩的建设和推广，会对无人驾驶的发展有巨大的推动。
The first is intelligent, the second is networked, the third is electric or new energy, so the construction and promotion of 5G and charging pile, will have a great impetus to the development of unmanned.
我认为，疫情之后无人驾驶产业会加速发展。
I think the driverless industry will accelerate after the epidemic.
无人驾驶的级别分为L1到L5，目前L2级别的无人驾驶技术相对成熟，但受制于技术难度、产业链成熟度等，要达到L5级别的无人驾驶，应该至少还需要十年以上的时间。
Drones are graded from L1 to L5, and currently L2-level unmanned technology is relatively sophisticated, but subject to technical difficulties, industrial chain maturity, etc., to reach the L5 level unmanned should take at least 10 years.
所以从短期来看，无人驾驶要先找一些细分的应用场景，才能够得到真正的推广。
So, in the short term, the driverless must first find some subdivision of the application scenario before it can be truly extended.
开放道路的无人驾驶，我认为短期是很难实现的。
Open road driverless, I think short-term is very difficult to achieve.
疫情之后，无人驾驶突然迎来了一波春天，很多公司获得了融资。
After the epidemic, driverless suddenly ushered in a wave of spring, with many companies getting financing.
疫情导致无人物流的爆发，无人驾驶产品体现出了非常大的利用价值和优势。
Outbreak caused by the outbreak of unmanned logistics, unmanned products reflect a very large use of value and advantages.
硬科技的产品有个特点，都会经历The Hype Cycle曲线，也叫技术炒作成熟度曲线。
Hard-technology products have a characteristic that goes through The Hype Cycle curve, also known as the technology hype maturity curve.
短期发展相对缓慢，一旦过了拐点，就会迎来爆发性的增长。
Short-term development is relatively slow, once the inflection point, will usher in explosive growth.
所以我认为自动驾驶经过疫情期间需求的拉动，先解决物流这个细分市场的应用，然后不断完善产品成熟度，通过不断的出货降低自动驾驶的成本，打磨产业链，将来会把自动驾驶带到一个更大的领域。
So I think the automatic driving through the epidemic period demand pull, first solve the application of logistics this subdivision market, then continuously improve product maturity, reduce the cost of automatic driving through continuous shipments, polish the industrial chain, will bring automatic driving to a larger area in the future.
现在自动驾驶处在低速载物的阶段，下一步可以走向低速载人，再下一步是高速载物，最终是高速载人。
Now the autopilot is in a low-speed phase, the next step can be low-speed manned, the next step is high-speed loading, and finally high-speed manned.
当这四大关口走完，就会迎来自动驾驶的盛夏。
When these four points walk over, will usher in the auto-driving midsummer.
每一次工业革命，都是由能源、交通、信息这三大领域的变革来决定的。
Every industrial revolution is determined by changes in energy, transportation, and information.
未来的智能化时代也一样，自动驾驶是人工智能领域最大的市场应用，它将会结合这三大领域的变革，所以有很大机会。
The same is true of the future age of intelligentization, where automatic driving is the largest market application in artificial intelligence. It will combine changes in these three areas, so there are great opportunities.
我们对自动驾驶的投资，其实就是在这三个领域做布局。
Our investment in automatic driving is in fact a layout in these three areas.
我们在自动驾驶领域的投资和布局，是围绕未来整个大的发展方向和趋势。
Our investment and layout in the field of automatic driving revolves around the overall direction and trend of development in the future.
除了整车的布局，我们在整个产业链上也布局了自动驾驶的一些核心部件，尤其是激光雷达和毫米波雷达。
In addition to the entire layout of the vehicle, we have also laid out the entire industrial chain of some of the core components of automatic driving, especially lidar and millimeter-wave radar.
现在机械式的激光雷达绝对不是最终的解决方案，最终的解决方案一定是固态的、芯片化的激光雷达，这样才能把成本降下来，所以我们还投资了一些做硅光激光雷达和毫米波雷达芯片的公司。
Now mechanical lidar is definitely not the final solution, the final solution must be solid-state, chip-based lidar to reduce costs, so we have invested in companies that make silicon lidar and millimeter-wave radar chips.
另外我们还布局了光学AI芯片、5G相关产业链、电动车产业链，以及自动驾驶道路、商业航天。
In addition, we also layout of optical AI chips, 5G-related industrial chains, electric car industry chains, as well as automatic driving roads, commercial space.
因为未来汽车除了要跟5G基站的区域做连接，还要跟商业卫星的GPS导航、卫星物联网和卫星互联网去做连接。
For the future, cars will be connected not only to the 5G base station area, but also to commercial satellite GPS navigation, satellite networking and satellite Internet.
在自动驾驶的情况下，车辆需要有全天候实时的数据支撑和保障，这是天地一体化的信息，网络是非常重要的。
In the case of automatic driving, the vehicle needs round-the-clock real-time data support and guarantee, which is the information of the integration of heaven and earth, network is very important.
我认为这次自动驾驶的春天，一定会把自动驾驶带到一个更高的高度。
I think this auto-driving spring will definitely take automatic driving to a higher level.
从低速物流，一直走向未来全自动的、实时的、全开放道路的无人驾驶。
From low-speed logistics to the future of fully automatic, real-time, all-open road unmanned.
我相信到那个时候，我们的生活会因为无人驾驶带来巨大的改变。
I believe that by then, our lives will be dramatically changed by unmanned aerial vehicles.
对话米磊：无人模式是不是真需求要看是否降低成本提高效率燃财经：中科创星专注硬科技投资，已经投资孵化了200多家硬科技项目，疫情期间哪些项目迎来了机会？哪些项目面临着挑战？米磊：面向终端消费者的项目，肯定会有一些挑战。
Dialogue MiLei: Does the no-one model really need to look at whether it reduces costs and improves efficiency? Flaming finance: Chong focuses on hard technology investments, has invested in more than 200 hard-technology projects, which projects present opportunities during the epidemic, and which projects face challenges?
但是我们投资的大部分项目都是toB的，受到的影响相对较小。
But most of the projects we have invested in are toB, which has had a relatively small impact.
我们有20多个项目，这次参与到了抗击疫情的行列中。
We have more than 20 projects, this time involved in the fight against the epidemic.
比如在医疗方面，通过我们的血管成像仪，穿着防护服、戴着护目镜、戴着手套的护士，就能更好地扎针。
At the medical level, for example, through our angiographers, nurses in protective clothing, goggles, and gloves, we are better able to pin needles.
红外热像仪去检测发热人群，还有做无接触电梯和无接触医院自助机的发展非常快、还有无人物流车等，也因为疫情得到了一些机会。
Infrared thermal imagers have been used to detect hot people, and there has been a rapid development of contact-free elevators and self-service machines in non-contact hospitals, as well as unmanned logistics vehicles, as well as some opportunities for the outbreak.
国家提出的新基建，对我们整个5G产业链相关的企业，也带来了巨大的发展机遇。
The new infrastructure proposed by the State has also brought about tremendous development opportunities for our entire 5G industrial chain-related enterprises.
燃财经：这次疫情期间，为什么我们听到无人配送比较多，但自动驾驶比较少？米磊：疫情期间自动驾驶确实提的比较少，但是无人配送提的非常多。
Flaming Finance: During this epidemic, why do we hear that there are more undelivered people, but less automatic drivers? Milei: It is true that there are fewer autopilot deliveries during the epidemic, but there are a lot of unattended deliveries.
因为这次面临的问题，实际是在终端的物流配送上。
Because this time faces the problem, actually is in the terminal logistics distribution.
大家都关在家里，导致配送员不够，无人配送的需求大增。
Everyone is shut in at home, resulting in an insufficient number of distribution staff, unattended demand greatly increased.
整体而言，要想在干线实现自动驾驶，目前来看还是比较难的。
On the whole, to achieve automatic driving in the main line, it is still relatively difficult.
在无人配送这块儿，因为大家都锁在家里，交通环境变简单了，所以低速的无人配送物流车，就得到了更多的应用。
In the nobody distributes this item, because everybody is locked in the home, the traffic environment becomes simple, so the low-speed unmanned distribution logistics vehicle, obtained more and more applications.
燃财经：疫情期间“无人配送”、“无人售卖”、“无人收银”等等“无人模式”比较火热，很多大公司也纷纷布局，你如何判断哪些是伪需求或阶段性需求？米磊：我认为现在的无人配送是短期的阶段性需求，等疫情结束，所有人都恢复到道路上之后，无人配送的难度会加大很多。
No one is selling, no one is selling, no one is collecting cashier, etc. How do you judge the false demand or staged demandMILEI: I think the undelivered is a short-term phased demand, and when the epidemic is over and everyone returns to the road, it will be much more difficult for the undelivered.
那时候无人配送是否成本更低效率更高，那就不确定了。
At that time, it was uncertain whether unattended distribution would be more cost-effective and efficient.
至于无人售卖，现在看来在一些特定的领域是有价值的，但无人收银我觉得现在并不是特别明确。
As for unsold people, there seems to be value in some specific areas, but no one is collecting cashier I don't think it's particularly clear right now.
总体而言，无人模式是不是真需求，要看在满足高频刚需的同时，跟传统的有人模式比起来，它的成本是不是在下降，效率是不是在提升。
In general, whether the unmanned model is really needed depends on whether the cost is decreasing and the efficiency is increasing compared with the traditional human mode while satisfying the high frequency requirement.
同时，实现安全可靠也是非常重要的，否则维护成本会很高。
At the same time, it is important to achieve safety and security, otherwise maintenance costs will be high.
燃财经：疫情对汽车品类的需求、车企的供应链造成了很大冲击，如果传导到上下游，会对自动驾驶领域的企业也造成一定影响，你认为这个影响主要体现在哪些方面？米磊：首先是乘用车的销售量短期内大幅下降，导致对新技术的关注也会短期下降，因为乘用车的厂商会更关注销量的恢复。
What do you think is the main impact of the epidemic on auto-driving enterprises? First of all, sales of passenger cars have fallen sharply in the short term, leading to a short-term decline in the focus on new technologies, as the manufacturers of passenger cars are more concerned with the recovery of sales.
无人物流的需求爆发和牵引，也导致一部分乘用车的车商，把一部分产能转移过来去生产物流车。
The demand explosion and traction of unattended logistics has also led some passenger car dealers to shift some of their capacity to produce logistics vehicles.
产品比技术更重要自动驾驶需要从技术到产品的落地燃财经：经过几年的高速发展之后，自动驾驶行业似乎并没有达到外界的预期，你认为自动驾驶行业距离真正的爆发还有多远？米磊：我觉得在无人物流这个细分领域，自动驾驶今年就开始爆发了，它在未来一到三年会有一个爆发，当然要实现全开放的无人驾驶，还需要更长的时间。
Automated Driving Needs Technology to Landing-Burning Finance: After several years of rapid growth, the auto-driving industry doesn't seem to live up to expectations. How far do you think the auto-driving industry is going to explode this year?
但是在一些垂直细分的领域，自动驾驶已经开始改变很多行业。
But in some areas of vertical segmentation, automatic driving has begun to transform many industries.
我相信，自动驾驶行业真正的应用已经开始了，所以我觉得2020年自动驾驶行业肯定会迎来一个高速发展的阶段。
I believe that the real application of the auto-driving industry has already started, so I think the 2020 auto-driving industry is sure to usher in a high-speed phase.
燃财经：从投资的角度，你认为中国无人车公司是否已经从VC级投资，到了需要大规模产业投资的阶段？米磊：现在已经有产业投资开始进入了，包括最近丰田投资pony.ai，博世投资驭势，证明产业投资已经开始关注到无人驾驶。
Flaming Finance: From an investment point of view, do you think China's unmanned companies have moved from VC-grade investment to the stage where large-scale industrial investment is needed? Miele: Now that industrial investment has begun to enter, including Toyota's recent investment in pony.ai, Bosch's investment command, it proves that industrial investment has begun to focus on unmanned vehicles.
所以我觉得现在应该是一个开始从VC投资向产业投资转变的阶段了，也说明无人驾驶的价值和需求已经得到了产业的认可。
So I think it's time to begin the transition from VC investment to industrial investment, and that the value and demand of unmanned aerial vehicles has been recognized by the industry.
燃财经：资金、技术、牌照，这三大要素中，你认为哪一个对当前阶段的自动驾驶企业更重要？米磊：对当前的自动驾驶企业而言，更重要的是从技术到产品的落地。
Flaming Finance: Money, technology, licensing, which of these three elements do you think is more important to the current phase of auto-driving? Miele: For current auto-driving companies, it is more important to move from technology to product landing.
过去我们更多的是在谈论自动驾驶的技术，但实际上，技术的产品化才是最重要的。
In the past, we talked more about the technology of automatic driving, but in fact, the product of technology is the most important.
一个硬科技企业的发展，成功的一个关键节点，是能否从技术到产品。
The key to success in the development of a hard technology enterprise is the ability to move from technology to products.
只有真正做到产品化，才能够解决行业未来发展的关键问题。
Only by realizing the product can we solve the key problems of the future development of the industry.
客户不为技术买单，只为产品买单。
Customers do not pay for the technology, only for the product.
所以我认为是否有落地的场景、能够真正解决客户的需求，这才是更重要的。
So I think it's even more important to have a landing scenario that really addresses the needs of the customer.
燃财经：将来如果想要获得更大发展，自动驾驶项目需要在哪些核心领域有突破？米磊：当产品越来越成熟，自动驾驶行业需要在核心零部件的模块化上有所突破。
Flaming Finance: What are the core areas that auto-driving projects need to break through in the future if they want to achieve greater growthMiley: As the product matures, the auto-driving industry needs to make breakthroughs in the modularization of core components.
实现产品的模块化，用同样标准的硬件产品，通过切换去支撑不同的落地场景，这是非常重要的。
It is important to achieve product modularization, using the same standard hardware product, to support different landing scenarios by switching.
像激光雷达这种核心部件，能不能把寿命提高，更换更可靠的零件，把成本从现在的几万块钱一台降到几千块，这样才能让无人驾驶的成本越来越低，才能让自动驾驶机器换人的逻辑得到实现。
Can core components like lidar increase life expectancy, replace more reliable parts, and reduce costs from tens of thousands of dollars to a few thousand dollars per unit, so that driverless costs become lower and lower, and the logic of replacing automatic pilots becomes a reality.
自动驾驶本质上是机器换人的一个行业，如果我的成本不能够低于有人驾驶的成本，那就无法实现真正的大规模落地。
Automatic driving is essentially a machine-changing industry, and if I can't drive at a lower cost than someone else, I can't really land on a large scale.
创业公司不要直接跟巨头PK要集中优势兵力做边缘突破燃财经：从乘用领域的无人车，到无人化的货运、外卖，技术原理都是相通的吗？乘用车进入货运领域，从商业的角度可行吗？短期内你更看好乘用还是货运模式？米磊：无人驾驶大的技术都是相通的，但是具体到不同的场景，还是有一定的区别。
Start-up companies should not be directly with the giant PK to concentrate superior forces to break through the edge of the business: from unmanned cars in the field of passenger cars to empty freight, take-out? Is it commercially feasible for passenger cars to move into the freight sector?
目前看的话，如果是直接从乘用车进入货运领域，技术上应该是可行的，但是需要重新去设计产品。
At the moment, it should be technically feasible to move directly from passenger cars to freight, but the product needs to be redesigned.
短期内货运的需求和技术的匹配度是更好的，对于乘用车，目前来看技术离需求还是有一定差距的。
Short-term freight demand and technology matching is better, for passenger cars, at present, technology is still a gap from the demand.
所以我短期更看好货运模式。
So I prefer the short-term freight mode.
燃财经：国外的自动驾驶企业也在加大在中国的布局，包括一些传统车企也加大了投资，创业公司如何迎接挑战？米磊：创业公司首先要成为细分领域的龙头，哪怕市场现在还没有那么大，不要试图去跟巨头在正面战场上直接PK，而是要从边缘切入，边缘创新，先把一些巨头目前看不上的市场拿下，然后从边缘一步步进攻，农村包围城市。
Flaming Finance: Foreign automakers are also expanding their presence in China, including some traditional car companies, and how can startups meet the challenge? Mi Lei: Start-ups need to be the leaders of the segment first, even if the market is not so big right now.
创业公司一定要保证在细分市场的资源投入，是竞争对手的两到三倍以上。
Start-ups must ensure that the resources invested in the segment are two to three times higher than those of their competitors.
在某一个时空点上，创造出比任何一个对手都更多的资源和投放，那么根据压强原则就能够获胜。
At some point in time, create more resources and more input than any one opponent, then you can win according to the principle of pressure.
哪怕是巨头，他们只要在这个细分市场的投入不如创业公司，那他也是打不过创业公司的。
Even a giant can't beat a startup if it doesn't invest as much as a startup in this segment.
这就是军事战略中的集中优势兵力。
This is the concentration of superior forces in military strategy.
所以创业公司得一个地盘一个地盘去抢。
So the start-up company had to take over a site.
燃财经：创业公司、科技巨头、汽车企业，哪个类型的玩家更有机会被资本重注？米磊：相对来说，创业公司更容易被资本下注。
Flaming Finance: Startups, tech giants, auto companies, what kind of players have a better chance of getting their capital reinvested? Miele: Relatively speaking, startups are more likely to be bets on capital.
因为对于投资来说，传统的汽车企业和科技巨头，投资会非常昂贵。
For investment, traditional car companies and technology giants can be very expensive.
从投资的角度，还是创业公司更具备投资价值。
From the investment point of view, or start-up companies have more investment value.
燃财经：5G会给自动驾驶行业带来哪些变化？米磊：5G能解决超低时延的问题，所以无人驾驶汽车可以通过云服务的方式，把高清地图的处理放到云上，实现实时通信。
Flaming Finance: What changes will the 5G bring to the auto-driving industryMILEI: 5gigabytes can solve the problem of ultra-low delay, so unmanned vehicles can use cloud services to put the processing of high-definition maps on clouds and realize real-time communication.
城市可以靠5G的基站，但在偏远的郊区，可能需要卫星来补充。
Cities can rely on 5 gigabytes of base stations, but in remote suburbs satellites may be needed to supplement them.
我认为未来一定是天地一体化信息网络，全球的任何人、任何车，都会实时接入这个网络，整个地球是协同的一张网。
I think the future must be an integrated information network, the world of anyone, any car, will be connected to this network in real time, the whole earth is a collaborative network.
