At a news conference on January 30, health-care company spokeswoman Mifeng said that truck drivers transporting goods to Hubei province needed to take the necessary precautions to return home without symptoms such as fever or cough, as needed to respond to the epidemic.
这是物流企业最想听到的消息。
This is the news that logistics enterprises want to hear most.
一家大型快递公司内部员工对透露，武汉宣布封城之后，他们向疫区运送了20多批物资，去了40多名司机，“基于疫情防控的需要，这些司机返回之后必须隔离。
Wuhan announced the closure of the city, they sent more than 20 shipments to the affected areas and sent more than 40 drivers, who must be quarantined on their return, according to an internal employee of a major express company
”“他们本来是在放假，看到群里号召，报名参与援助，相当于志愿者，没拿一分钱，而且还冒着风险。
"They were on holiday, they saw calls from the group, they signed up to help, they didn't get a cent, they took risks.
但从武汉那边回来之后需要隔离14天，这种情况下，志愿报名的司机越来越少，运力缺口越来越大。
But when they returned from Wuhan and needed to be quarantined for 14 days, fewer and fewer drivers volunteered and there was a growing gap in capacity.
”上述员工表示。
"said the employee.
过去一周多时间，全国各地的物资正紧急运往武汉等湖北疫区，正值春节假期，大部分运输公司刚好处于“半歇业”状态，可以调动的运力资源本就有限，隔离政策加剧运力匮乏。
During the past week or so, supplies from all over the country have been transported to Wuhan and other endemic areas of Hubei Province on an emergency basis.
卫健委的上述表态有望缓解运力的供需矛盾。
The health committee's statement is expected to ease the capacity of supply and demand.
把5G设备运进火神山闫东方是德邦快递一名司机，武汉本地人。
5 G equipment into the fire Yan East is Delphi express a driver, Wuhan native.
除夕夜凌晨一点多钟，他接到武汉车队负责人电话，让他早上去接一辆从北京来的车，车上运的是捐赠给火神山医院的5G通信设备，着急等着安装。
On New Year's Eve at 1: 00 a.m., he received a telephone call from the head of the Wuhan motorcade, asking him to pick up a car from Beijing in the morning, carrying 5G communication equipment donated to Mount Huoshen Hospital, waiting to be installed.
大年初一，天蒙蒙亮，闫东方开着一辆9.6米的厢式货车赶到武汉市东西湖收费站，“当时已经不断有物资运到武汉，外地车要么进不来，要么因为疫情不愿进武汉，我们只好前往高速路口迎接。
On the first day of the New Year, it is clear, Yan Eastern driving a 9.6-meter van to Wuhan East-West Lake toll station, "At that time, supplies were constantly arriving in Wuhan, field cars can not enter, or because the epidemic did not want to enter Wuhan, we had to go to the highway junction to meet.
”据闫东方介绍，德邦内部在除夕夜当晚成立特别行动小组，调配运力运输防疫物资，司机短缺是个棘手问题。
Yan Eastern said that Germany's internal New Year's Eve to set up a special task force to transport epidemic prevention materials, the shortage of drivers is a thorny issue.
德邦快递武汉分公司虽有300辆多货车可供调度，大年初一初二两天，只有三名司机可以出车，初三初四增至8名司机，目前共计12名司机，大部分来自于武汉和周边城市。
Wuhan Debang express delivery branch although there are 300 multi-lorries available for dispatch, the first two days of the New Year, only three drivers can travel, the fourth day of the third day of eight drivers, currently a total of 12 drivers, mostly from Wuhan and surrounding cities.
大批物资等待运送，这些司机不得不连轴转。
Large quantities of supplies were waiting to be delivered and the drivers had to work hand in hand.
“1月29号早上，两名司机拉着一批医疗防护物资从武汉去往400公里之外的十堰市，1月30日早上7点多连夜返回。
"On the morning of January 29, two drivers pulled medical supplies from Wuhan to Shiyan City, 400 kilometers away, returning overnight at 7 a.m. on January 30.
”闫东方说。
Yan Eastern said.
武汉市物流协会秘书长石君表示，目前医疗物资进入武汉比较畅通，“如果物资是指定捐赠给红十字会，由红十字会进行统一调配。
Shi Jun, secretary-general of the Wuhan Municipal Logistics Association, said medical supplies were now flowing smoothly into Wuhan. "If the supplies are earmarked for donation to the Red Cross, the Red Cross will make a unified deployment.
如果不是，我们可以协调点对点对接，然后运给医院等机构。
If not, we can coordinate point-to-point docking and ship it to hospitals and other agencies.
”1月28日，闫东方还给武汉金银潭医院送去一批海底捞公司捐赠的方便火锅，“我们到医院时，护士长看到我们戴的是普通口罩，回屋里拿出10个医用口罩和一瓶洗手液，让我们注意防护，出来接收物资的还有身穿迷彩制服的医疗队员，他们看上去很疲惫，眼球上都是血丝。
"Yan Eastern also sent to Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital on January 28 a batch of convenience cookers donated by bottom fishing companies." When we arrived at the hospital, the head nurse saw us wearing an ordinary mask, returned to the house to take out 10 medical masks and a bottle of hand sanitizer, and came out to receive supplies from the medical team in camouflage uniforms, who looked tired and bloodstained from their eyeballs.
”闫东方说，“我们能做的就是一刻不耽搁地将物资送到最需要的地方。
Yan Eastern said, "All we can do is deliver goods to where they are most needed without delay.
”针对司机短缺问题，德邦武汉公司已经向上级部门反映，“我们一方面在和司机积极沟通，另一方面把一些愿意回来的司机信息上报给公安机关备案，好让他们尽快返岗。
In response to the driver shortage, De Bonham Wuhan Company has told higher authorities that while actively communicating with drivers, we are reporting information about drivers who are willing to return to the police for record so that they can return to work as soon as possible.
”应对结构性运力紧张此次疫情爆发时间正值春节期间，绝大部分物流公司处于“半歇业”状态。
The outbreak comes at a time when most logistics companies are "semi-closed" during the Spring Festival holiday.
一家快递公司负责人对我们表示，公司职能部门员工1月16日放假，快递员和司机19号放假，“我们承接援助物资运输需求时，需要按地区协调司机回来上班，优先安排能发整车捐赠物资的网点出车。
"When we accept the need to transport aid, we need to coordinate drivers back to work by region, giving priority to those who can deliver the donated goods," said one express company official.
”河南一家医用耗材公司负责人告诉我们，无论是原材料运进来，还是医用防护成品运出去，都遇到运输难题。
The head of a medical consumables company in Henan told us there were transport problems for both raw materials and medical protection products.
“防疫部门的确有顾虑，担心车辆和人员流动增加防疫难度，而司机则担心路上疫情监测关卡比较多，交通不畅，影响运输效率。
"The epidemic prevention authorities do have concerns that the movement of vehicles and people will make it more difficult to prevent epidemics, while drivers are worried that more checkpoints will be erected to monitor the epidemic and traffic will affect transport efficiency.
”这位负责人说，现在的问题不是某一个网点、某一个平台是否营业，而是需要协调整个物流系统。
The question now is not whether a particular site or platform is operating, but rather whether the entire logistics system needs to be coordinated, the official said.
”一边是源源不断的物资运送需求，一边是无法及时返岗的司机，这使得运力的供需矛盾更加突出。
On the one hand, there is a constant demand for supplies, and on the other, drivers who are unable to return in time, making the supply and demand for capacity even more acute.

1月29日，他给我们展示了一张聊天截图。

”蒋国军认为，出现这种情况，一方面因很多司机都回家了，一时半会不能回到工作岗位，另一方面是一些司机担心疫情，可能被隔离，或者滞留武汉。
Jiang said the situation arose partly because many drivers had gone home and could not return to work for a while, and partly because some drivers feared the epidemic and might be quarantined or detained in Wuhan.
