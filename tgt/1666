“安全套大卖”不只是一个玩笑，还有哪些意想不到的逆势上扬？文|《财经》记者 杨立赟编辑 |余乐今年2月14日，你收到玫瑰花了吗？各地对疫情严防死守，女士们在办公室收到一束玫瑰、接受同事们注目礼的戏码，不太可能上演了。
"Condom Selling" isn't just a joke; are there unintended upswings? & # 160; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & #
由于市场低迷，今春中国鲜花市场受到重创，数百万枝玫瑰被销毁。
Millions of roses were destroyed in China's flower market this spring as the market slumped.
云南斗南花卉市场数据显示，2020年2月14日前后，花卉交易量、供应量不足2019年同期的一半。
On or about February 14, 2020, flower volume and supply are less than half what they were in the same period in 2019, according to data from the Du'nan flower market in Yunnan.
该花卉市场占据全国70%的市场份额，是中国最大的鲜切花交易市场。
With a market share of 70%, the flower market is China's largest market for cut flowers.
云南斗南花卉产业集团企划运营总监董瑞在接受梨视频采访时称，往年2月上旬的鲜花交易额每天有2500万元左右，从2月3日开始进入交易高峰，延续到2月12日；今年只有2月10日、11日这两天算是高峰，供应量、交易量只有去年的30-40%。
In a pear video interview, Dong Rui, director of business planning and operations at the Du Nan Flower Industry Group in Yunnan, said in a pear video interview that flowers traded for about 25 million yuan a day in the first half of February, peaking on February 3 and February 12.
他表示，今年的花卉整体价格只有去年的三分之一，往年A级玫瑰花每枝价格至少2.5元，最高可达5元；今年每枝不到1.5元。
He said the overall price of flowers this year was only one-third that of last year, with category A roses costing at least 2.5 yuan each and a maximum of five yuan each; this year they cost less than 1.5 yuan.
同时，物流成本上涨超过两倍。
Meanwhile, logistics costs have more than tripled.
需求低、供应少、物流不畅、运输价格极高，这种情况下，花农和供应商都不愿意做吃力不讨好的生意，仅仅2月10日，就有100多万枝玫瑰被销毁。
With low demand, low supply, poor logistics and extremely high transport prices, growers and suppliers were reluctant to engage in thankless business, with more than 1 million roses destroyed on 10 February alone.
春节期间，人们多宅在家里，计生情趣产品的刚需逆势上扬，“安全套大卖”不只是一个玩笑。
During the Spring Festival, people stay at home, family planning products just uptrend, "Condom sales" is not just a joke.
京东提供给《财经》的数据显示，常住地在北京、上海、广东、福建的用户，春节期间计生情趣产品成交额增长较快，其中福建和广东的涨幅分别达231%和196%。
According to Caijing, users with permanent residence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong and Fujian have seen rapid growth in turnover of family planning products during the Spring Festival, with Fujian and Guangdong gaining 231 per cent and 196 per cent, respectively.
这些订单主要发往用户回家过年的地区，导致来自非常用地址的订单增幅超过了常用地址，从侧面反映出年轻人延迟返城的现实。
These orders were sent mainly to areas where users were returning home for the Lunar New Year, resulting in orders from non-permanent addresses rising faster than usual, reflecting the delayed return of young people to the city.
对于另一些以爱情为核心产品主题的行业来说，受到的影响不仅仅在2月14日这一天。
For others, where love is the core product theme, the impact isn't just on February 14.
婚庆公司、相亲公司面临的是至少三个月的考验，虽然结婚和相亲需求只是被延期而非减少，但一众小微企业可能因资金链断裂而消失在这个春天。
Wedding and dating companies face at least three months of testing. While demand for marriage and matchmaking has been delayed rather than reduced, a handful of micro and small businesses could disappear this spring as the financial chain breaks.
不过也有线上结婚服务平台认为，正如电商行业在2003年非典逆势崛起，此次疫情将利好婚庆行业的数字化。
But wired marriage service platform also thinks, just as electric business industry rises against the trend of SARS in 2003, this epidemic will benefit the digitization of wedding industry.
酒店、婚庆遭遇寒冬除了玫瑰，烛光晚餐和酒店住宿也受到疫情限制，相对应的餐饮和酒店业同样遇冷。
Hotels, weddings and winters Except for roses, candlelight dinners and hotel accommodations have been hit by the epidemic, as have the corresponding restaurants and hotels.
根据“去哪儿”提供给《财经》的数据，受疫情影响，今年2月14日前后各旅游产品热度大幅下降。
According to Caijing where to go, the epidemic has led to a sharp drop in the popularity of tourism products around February 14.
国内酒店预订人数较去年同期下降95%。
Domestic hotel bookings are down 95% from the same period last year.
飞猪单体酒店业务总经理张嵘对《财经》表示，目前全国大部分酒店均在停业状态，海南、浙江、广东等地酒店约有7成以上停业，华北、云南停业比例更高，2月14日的损失惨重。
At present, most hotels in China are out of business. About 70 percent of hotels in Hainan, Zhejiang and Guangdong are out of business.
除了这类即时消费，中长周期服务型的婚庆和相亲婚恋行业也十分依赖于2月14日前后的旺季。
In addition to this type of instant gratification, the medium- and long-cycle service-type wedding and dating industries are also heavily dependent on the high season around February 14.
“一般来说，春节之后到2月14日都是我们的旺季，因为过年回家被催婚、受打击的年轻人，一过完年就会来相亲。
"In general, February 14 is our peak season after the Spring Festival because young people who are urged to get married and hit by the Lunar New Year come to see each other as soon as the New Year is over
”一位不愿具名的相亲婚恋公司员工对《财经》记者表示，但是今年受疫情影响，公司已经通知员工，延迟半个月发放工资，手上的资金先结算1月的推广费。
An employee at the matchmaking company, who declined to be named, told Caijing, but this year, affected by the outbreak, the company has told employees to pay half a month's salary and pay the January promotion fees first.
这家相亲婚恋公司拥有APP和小程序等线上平台，以及十几家线下门店，走的是O2O模式——以线上平台为流量入口，在线下开设多家门店，提供“红娘”和客户对接沟通的场所。
The matchmaking company has online platforms such as APP and apps, as well as a dozen off-line stores in O2O mode - using online platforms as traffic entrances and multiple on-line shops that offer matchmaking venues for matchmakers and customers.
据官网介绍，其付费会员超过千万。
According to the official website, its paid members more than 10 million.
上述员工称，虽然公司定位为互联网公司，线上平台主要用以导流，客户签约下单还是在线下门店居多。
Although the company is positioned as an Internet company, the online platform is used to channel traffic, said the employee.
目前线下店都不能开门营业，错过这个旺季，意味着流失大批新订单。
At the moment, off-line stores are closed, and missing out on this busy season means losing lots of new orders.
“目前还没有裁员，但老板一直威胁，不好好上班就要裁员。
"There have been no layoffs, but the boss has been threatening to lay off workers if he doesn't get to work.
”同样依赖线下门店的还有大批婚庆公司。
Also relying on offline stores are a host of wedding companies.
百特婚礼的负责人祝赟在接受《财经》采访时称，公司2月和3月将损失300万利润。
Zhu Dai, head of Best practices at the ceremony, told Caijing that the company would lose 3m yuan in February and March.
“婚庆是以家庭为单位、重决策型的服务行业，如果只是线上聊聊，客户无法想象自己的婚礼会做成什么样子。
"Wedding is a family-based, decision-making service industry, and customers can't imagine what their wedding will be like if they just chat online.
他们需要和我们见面，建立深度信任，才会决定下单。
They need to meet with us to build a deep level of trust before deciding to place an order.
70%的订单在线下门店才能成交。
Seventy per cent of orders come offline.
”受疫情影响，全国多地已暂停婚姻登记。
Registration of marriages has been suspended in many parts of the country because of the epidemic.
祝赟说，原本定于2、3月份举办的婚礼都取消了，所有客户推迟到五月以后再办婚礼。
Zhu Kai-yun said the wedding, which had been scheduled for February and March, had been cancelled and all customers would postpone their wedding until May.
这意味着已经签约的单子，也因为无法提供服务，近期收不到预付款和尾款。
This means that there are signed lists and that advances and balances will not be received in the near future due to non-availability of services.
目前，每月30多万元的房租和人力成本都需要自己垫付。
Currently, more than $300,000 a month in rent and labor costs have to pay their own advance.
“2020年在黄历上是一个很好的年份。
"2020 is a great year for the Yellow Calendar.
结婚的需求不会少，只是延迟了，这会导致另一个问题——现在我要养着这批闲置员工，但到了下半年结婚潮的时候人手又不够。
The need to get married is no less than a delay, which leads to another problem - I have to keep the idle staff now, but by the second half of the year the wedding wave will be understaffed.
”祝赟说，到时候哪家公司有足够的人才储备，就会活得更好，前提是得扛过这几个月。
Zhu Kai-yun said the company would be better off if it had enough talent in hand to carry it through the months.
婚庆行业本身是一个“蚂蚁市场”，集中度不高，一众小微企业恐怕熬不过这个春天。
The wedding itself is an "ant market", concentration is not high, a number of micro and small enterprises may not survive this spring.
疫情无意间推动婚庆数字化虽然不能按传统方式度过2月14日，但人们表达感情的需求总是存在。
Digitization of Wedding Unintentionally Although people can't spend February 14 in the traditional way, there is always a need to express their feelings.
整体而言，线上的、数字化的平台和产品承压较小，甚至无意间获得了一个新的机遇。
On the whole, online, digitized platforms and products are under less pressure, even inadvertently gaining a new opportunity.
线上结婚服务平台“婚礼纪”面对疫情挑战时，依然保持乐观。
The online wedding service platform Wedding Day remains upbeat in the face of the epidemic's challenges.
该公司品牌负责人王萧蕾接受《财经》采访时表示，平台上很多商家还不能复工，婚礼纪就组织了三场直播公开课，为商家培训数字化运营的内容，每场有近千个商家参与。
In an interview with Caijing, Wang Xiaolei, the company's brand director, said many businesses on the platform were still unable to get back to work, and the ceremony featured three live public sessions to train businesses in digital content, with nearly a thousand businesses each participating.
王萧蕾了解到，有些婚庆公司已经遇到客户退单退款的情况，婚礼纪帮助组织延长合同有效期，稳定客户和订单。
Ms. Wang learned that some wedding companies have encountered cases of refund of bills from customers, and wedding discipline helps the organization to extend the contract and stabilize customers and orders.
婚礼纪的盈利模式和天猫类似，收入来自商家入场费、订单的利润分成以及其他服务和技术类产品。
Wedding-day profit patterns are similar to those of cats, with revenues from merchant admissions, profit-sharing for orders and other services and technology products.
因此，它和平台上的商家是荣辱与共的关系。
Therefore, it and the business on the platform is a relationship of honor and disgrace.
“往年从大年初四一直到2月14日都是婚庆的旺季，会做很多促销活动，营收确实收到很大影响。
"Normally, it's a busy season from the beginning of the year to the 14th of February. There's a lot of sales going on and revenue really gets a big impact.
”她表示，全国一共有数百万婚庆公司，目前需要快速恢复无接触经营。
She said there were millions of wedding companies across the country and that there was a need to quickly resume contact-free operations.
婚礼纪借此时机推出“云备婚”活动，为一线医务人员、军人提供“免费定制婚礼”，同时帮助商家精细化管理线上虚拟店、开通快速入驻通道。
Wedding officials used the occasion to launch a "cloud-ready marriage" campaign, offering "free custom weddings" for front-line medical staff and military personnel, as well as helping businesses fine-tune online virtual stores and open fast-track entrances.
“以前婚庆公司觉得把线下店经营好就行，现在逐渐意识到做虚拟店的重要性。
"Wedding companies used to think it was good to run a store offline, but now they're coming to realize the importance of being a virtual store.
”王萧蕾说，如同2003年非典时期电商行业逆势崛起，此次疫情或许无意间推动了婚庆行业的数字化趋势。
Like the rise of the SARS electric business industry in 2003, the epidemic may have unwittingly helped digitize the industry, Wang said.
疫情把情侣们阻隔成了牛郎和织女，见不到面，唯有相互快递一份礼物。
Outbreak of the lovers into a cowherd and Weaver Maid, do not see the face, only mutual express a gift.
奢侈品电商寺库为了备战2月14日，从2月5日推出了同城极速达服务，北京用户购买指定奢侈品可实现五环内2小时送达。
Luxury goods stores in preparation for February 14, launched February 5 with the city's fastest service, Beijing users can purchase designated luxury goods can be achieved within the five rings within two hours.
购买数据显示，2月14日前后使用此业务的用户多集中在朝阳、西城、海淀等区域，普拉达（Prada）和菲拉格慕（Ferragamo）的手拿包等产品最受消费者喜爱。
According to the purchase data, most users of the service around February 14 are concentrated in areas such as Chaoyang, Westlife and Haidian, with products such as Prada and Ferragamo's handbags most popular with consumers.
根据京东提供的销售数据，今年2月14日前礼品首选是美妆护肤，2月8-12日成交额同比上升36%，单日平均成交额是春节期间的3.73倍。
According to sales figures from Jingdong, the top choice for gift items before Feb. 14 is cosmetic, with turnover up 36% year-on-year on Feb. 8-12 and 3.73 times the average daily turnover during Spring Festival.
不过，2月14日前，大牌们的广告投放力度远远低于去年。
However, before February 14, the major brands of advertising far less than last year.
一名拥有数十万粉丝的时尚博主告诉《财经》记者，今年2月14日没有接到任何广告订单，往年2月14日前期会接到不少手表、护肤品、香水、巧克力等品牌的投放订单。
Caijing, a fashion blogger with hundreds of thousands of fans, told Caijing on Feb. 14 that orders for watches, skincare products, perfumes and chocolates were received early February 14.
“博主不能出门拍素材，家庭场景的限制比较多，品牌方在选择博主的过程中就取消项目了。
"Bloggers can not go out to shoot material, more restrictions on the family scene, the brand in the process of selecting the blogger canceled the project.
”近期她的收入减少了近八成。
Her income has fallen nearly eighty percent recently.
“不过，已经接到了一些品牌打算投放在三八妇女节的广告，疫情结束之后可能回暖。
"However, some brands have already received advertisements for Women's Day on March 8 and it may get warmer after the epidemic ends.
