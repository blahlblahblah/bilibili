Check out the first 2 articles. Which industries are breaking out? "SME Survival Guide."
作者 | 苏琦编辑 | 魏佳“今天你买到菜了吗？”这段时间，这句话成功代替“你吃了吗”成为新的聊天问候方式，番茄和绿叶菜也成了新的硬通货。
At the same time, the phrase "Did you eat" became the new way of greeting, and tomatoes and leafy green vegetables became the new hard currency.
现在，家里的长辈也开始线上买生鲜，每天甚至定好闹钟在线蹲守抢菜，时间也越定越早。
Now, the elders at home also began to buy fresh online, every day even set a clockwork clocks online, the sooner the time.
网上暗暗流传着一张《北京抢菜指南》，标注好了各家生鲜电商APP的库存更新时间，大家的抢菜闹钟也从早上5点提前到了凌晨12点。
A "Guidebook for Beijing Stealing of Vegetables" has been circulated on the Internet, marking the time of stock renewal of APPs for live TV companies, and everyone's alarm clock for grabbing vegetables has been brought forward from 5am to 12am.
在这个特殊时期，大家都将自己的活动半径缩小至家里的卧室到厨房，有分析认为，短期内暴涨的线上买菜需求，或让去年惨遭洗牌的生鲜电商行业迎来新机遇。
At this particular time, everyone has shrunk the radius of their activities from their bedrooms to their kitchens, and some analysts say the surge in demand for vegetables over the short term may usher in new opportunities in the live-electronics industry, which suffered a reshuffle last year.
一方面，疫情之下催生出用户，加速了对市场的教育，企业相当于获得了免费的广告，但另一方面，抢购潮背后，企业面临着供应链、配送、物流、人力、账期等一系列考验。
On the one hand, the epidemic has created users and accelerated the education of the market, with enterprises receiving free advertising, but on the other hand, behind the rush to buy, companies face a series of tests such as supply chain, distribution, logistics, manpower and account period.
同样是抢菜，一二线和三四线城市面临的问题也不一样。
The same is true for vegetables. Second-tier and third-tier cities face different problems.
一二线城市生鲜电商APP配送时间长，溢价高，买菜全靠抢；三四线城市的社区团购模式则面临需求分散、选择少、成团不足遭遇退团的情况。
First and second-line APP distribution time, high premium, all rely on grabbing vegetables; the third and fourth-tier cities of the community purchase model faced scattered demand, few options, insufficient groups encountered withdrawal.
但如同17年前的非典疫情给电商平台带来生机一样，很多独角兽企业已经在这次的危机之中寻求转型，生鲜电商行业也是如此。
But just as the SARS epidemic brought life to the telecoms platform 17 years ago, many unicorns have sought to transform themselves in this crisis, as has the live electricity industry.
一些生鲜电商平台联合餐饮商家另谋出路，餐饮零售化成为新趋势。
Some fresh electric business platform joint catering businesses find another outlet, catering and retailing has become a new trend.
农产品直供社区、农产品产区走播的新业态，也是未来的机会点。
Direct supply of agricultural products to the community, agricultural production areas of the new industry, but also future opportunities.
凌晨抢菜订单暴涨用户留存成问题家在北京朝阳区的王女士2月5日早上9点在京东到家下了一笔订单，预约的送货时间是2月6日9:30-10:10，因为之前的时间都已经约满。
Ms. Wang, who lives in Beijing's Chaoyang district, placed an order at 9: 00 am on Feb. 5 to make an appointment for delivery between 9: 30 and 10: 10 on Feb. 6 because the previous appointments were already full.
结果直到2月7日18:00，这个订单才送到，整个过程历时57个小时，且有两份肉类无货。
As a result, the order was not delivered until 1800 hours on 7 February, a process that lasted 57 hours, and two pieces of meat were not available.
其间，王女士曾在网上找客服咨询，但前面还有76人排队，等待时间过长，她只好放弃。
In the meantime, Ms. Wang has been looking for customer service online, but there are still 76 people in line, waiting too long, she had to give up.
像王女士这样买了菜迟迟收不到货的人有不少，背后是订单量的激增：京东生鲜配送到家业务相对节前环比增长370%，叮咚买菜大年三十的订单量同比上月增长超过300%；美团买菜在北京地区的日订单量达到了春节节前单量的2-3倍；除夕至初四，每日优鲜平台实收交易额较去年同期增长321%。
With orders rising 370% over the same period last month, orders for Dongsheng fresh food items in Beijing increased by more than 300% year-on-year. Daily orders for U.S. food purchases in Beijing were 2-3 times higher than those for the same period last year.
整体运力不足，也无法再用原来的配送时间标准来考核配送员。
The overall capacity is insufficient, and the original delivery time standards can no longer be used to assess the distributor.
从历年数据来看，生鲜电商春节的销量会比平时稍微低一些，因为一线城市用户量减少，用户结构发生变化，整体订单会有所下降。
According to historical data, the sales volume of the Spring Festival will be slightly lower than usual because of the decrease in the number of first-tier city users, the user structure changes, the overall order will decline.
今年在疫情的影响下，同一时期的订单量一直在爬升，某些品类还出现抢购。
Orders for the same period have been climbing this year because of the epidemic, with panic buying in some categories.
不少人定闹钟半夜起来抢菜，甚至还制作了抢菜攻略，让人不由想起当年大家一起半夜在QQ开心农场偷菜的光景。
Many people set alarm clocks up in the middle of the night to grab vegetables, and even made a robbery strategy, people can not help but think of the middle of the night in the QQ happy farm theft scene.
订单爆发式的增长，让很多人认为生鲜电商迎来了新的机遇，然而，想要把握住这个机遇，先要面临新的挑战。
The explosion of orders has led many people to believe that new opportunities are opening up for live telecoms operators. However, to seize this opportunity, we must first face new challenges.
首先是货源和物流的问题。
The first is the problem of supply and logistics.
“每天晚上10点停止营业之后，我们会同步第二天的库存，这个内部操作不知道怎么被顾客发现了，基本上12点到凌晨1点订单量就疯涨，导致很多用户睡一觉起来发现没菜了，后面我们只得分拨出库存，这种情况才缓解下来。
"When we close at 10 every night, we synchronize our inventory for the next day and the internal operations go undetected by customers. Basically orders go up between 12 and 1 a.m., causing many users to fall asleep and find no food, and then we have to allocate our inventory.
”每日优鲜采购负责人李薇告诉燃财经。
Li Wei, daily head of fresh purchasing, told Flaming Finance.
进货和补货的节奏完全不一样了，这几天李薇的电话就没停过。
Purchase and replenishment of the rhythm of a completely different, these days Li Wei's phone did not stop.
据她介绍，现在订单量激增，需要临时增加多个供应商，一些品类像是绿叶蔬菜和番茄，已经开始限购，目的是为了让更多需要的人都能买到，现在每天要向全国十余个城市供应1000吨蔬菜。
She says orders are soaring and more suppliers need to be added on a temporary basis. Some categories, such as leafy green vegetables and tomatoes, have already begun to be restricted in order to reach more needy people.
“口罩、消毒水之类的物资就更别说了，行情一分钟一变。
"Not to mention masks, disinfectants and things like that, the market is changing every minute.
”图 / 视觉中国市场出现的食材短缺问题，主要是因为春节期间产地工作人员不足，以及受疫情影响的封村封路等现象带来的流通环节不畅。
Figure / Vision The shortage of ingredients in the Chinese market is mainly due to poor circulation caused by insufficient production staff during the Spring Festival and the closure of villages affected by the epidemic.
李薇称，前几日部分地区只能通过人拉肩扛的方式将商品运输出村，平台正在加快跟政府沟通，但区域之间也有沟通成本，比如北京出的文件到青岛就不认了。
Li said that in the past few days, some areas can only carry goods out of the village through shoulder-pulling, the platform is speeding up communication with the government, but there are regional communication costs, such as Beijing documents to Qingdao do not.
其次是用户留存的问题。
Then there is the issue of user retention.
疫情发生之后，生鲜电商触达到了一批原来没有线上买菜意识，但有线上买菜实力的人。
After the outbreak of the outbreak, the live electricity business reached a group of people who did not buy vegetables online awareness, but the strength of buying vegetables on the cable.
这部分人的收入水平能够支撑起线上买菜需要支付的服务溢价，对生鲜电商来说确实是一大利好。
The income level of this part of the people can support the purchase of vegetables on the line to pay a premium for services, for the fresh electricity business is a big positive.
从这个意义上来说，疫情仿佛是一个“广告宣传”，加速了对市场的教育。
In this sense, the epidemic appears to be an "advertising campaign" that accelerates the education of the market.
但等疫情过去之后，这部分新增用户还愿不愿意每次买菜都支付溢价？用户能沉淀下来多少？不可忽略的是，在这个过程中，不管有没有消费能力的用户其实都被触达了，但是公司为了维护住这部分没有消费实力的用户，也付出了不必要的成本。
But when the epidemic is over, will this new segment of consumers pay a premium for each purchase? How much can the user settle down? It is important to note that in the process, users with or without the ability to consume are actually touched, but the company incurs unnecessary costs to maintain this segment of users who do not have the power to consume.
同时卖菜平台在这个时期为了迅速拢住客户，需要保证稳定的供给同时又不能涨价，成本也非常高。
At the same time, the platform selling vegetables in order to quickly close customers, need to ensure a stable supply without raising prices, the cost is very high.
“到底会不会出现叫好不叫座的情况，就看后面怎么样去转化了。
"After all can appear the situation that does not call a seat, see how to transform after all.
”苏宁生态链基金投资总监施卓杰对燃财经表示，生鲜电商能活下来的其实规模都不小了，这个时期建议大家稳步发展，没有必要亏着钱往前跑规模。
Shu Zhuojie, head of investment at Suning Eco-Chain Fund, told Flaming Finance that the size of the fresh electric traders could survive was not small, suggesting steady development without the need to run ahead at a loss.
李薇对此也持同样态度：“生鲜电商在价格方面还是很克制的。
Li Wei also took the same attitude: "Fresh electricity manufacturers in the price or very restrained.
我们更在乎的是用户的长期留存，不会做一锤子买卖。
We are more concerned about the long-term retention of users, will not do a hammer deal.
”订单密度不足存风险干得多亏得多一二线城市抢菜忙，三四线城市也没有闲着。
"Order density is not enough at risk, thanks to a lot of second-tier cities scrambling for food, and three or four-lane cities are not idle.
之前的春节，社区团购的团长一般都会选择休团，今年团长们都提前开始忙了。
Before the Spring Festival, the head of the community group purchase will generally choose to suspend the group, this year's leaders are busy ahead of schedule.
与一线城市的用户相比，三线及三线以下城市的用户，其实并不太在意配送的时间，他们更希望找一些性价比高的商品，社区团购恰恰就解决了用户的难点。
Compared with users in first-tier cities, users in third-tier and lower-tier cities do not really care much about delivery times. They prefer to find more cost-effective products. Community-group buying just solves the user's difficulties.
既不需要去菜市场，又能买到比较新鲜、平价的果蔬食材，无接触式配送在一定程度上也降低了感染风险。
Do not need to go to the vegetable market, but also to buy more fresh, affordable fruits and vegetables, contact-free distribution to a certain extent also reduced the risk of infection.
在所有的社区团购中，十荟团是以生鲜作为主打品类的品牌，日常生鲜占比就在60%-75%之间。
Of all the community group purchases, the 10-meta-group is a brand with raw materials as the main category, with a daily fresh share of between 60% and 75%.
疫情发生之前，十荟团每天晚上11点截单，这时候统计出来的数据通常会和预判的数据差不太多，这个数据在白天就已经发给集采供应部，每天夜间12:00-2:00货物到仓，入仓质检之后，凌晨2:00-4:00开始配货打包，5:00-7:00司机用车将货物运走，顺着排好的线路开始分发，次日可以完成配送。
Before the outbreak of the outbreak, the 10-point-of-the-line collection typically produced data not much different from what had been predicted. The data was sent to the Collection and Supply Department during the day. After the cargo arrived at the warehouse at 12: 00-2: 00 pm, the packing started at 2: 00-4: 00 a.m.
疫情期间，这样的节奏在复工的第一天被打破，“刚刚开团，上架的蔬菜就被抢光了，为了保障百姓的民生物资供应，运营立刻开始进行补货。
During the outbreak, the rhythm was broken on the first day of resumption of work, "just opened up, shelved vegetables were looted, in order to ensure the people's livelihood supplies, the operation immediately began to replenish.
”十荟团相关负责人告诉燃财经，疫情期间，老百姓的需求也有明显的变化，以前其他品类的货物销售占比都比较稳定，近期大家的购买品类多集中在蔬菜、肉禽蛋、米面粮油和方便食品上。
During the outbreak, the needs of the people also changed noticeably, with the proportion of goods sold in other categories having been relatively stable, with the majority of recent purchases concentrated on vegetables, poultry eggs, rice noodle oil and ready-to-eat foods.
尤其是绿叶蔬菜，“前几天，我们的一个仓库中，菠菜的单日销量刷新了这个仓库的绿叶菜销售记录。
Green leafy vegetables in particular. "The other day, a single day of spinach sales at one of our warehouses set a new record for green leafy vegetables.
”为了保供应，十荟团选用了两种模式，一种是集采，全国统一发货，例如某些商品从源产地直接发货，通过对物流线路的优化，提高运输效率。
To ensure supply, the group opted for two models, one collecting and delivering goods uniformly across the country, such as the direct shipment of certain goods from the source, and improving transport efficiency through optimization of logistics routes.
另外一种是地采模式，对本地商品盘进行调整，提高商品新鲜度。
The other is the ground mining model, to adjust the local commodity plate to improve the freshness of the goods.
“我们一月份的GMV已经突破5亿，在全国有十几个大型原产地资源，可以从源头发货。
"We have more than 500 million GMVs in January and a dozen large-scale resources of origin across the country that can be shipped from the source.
”十荟团相关负责人称。
The group's related officials said.
供应链模式没问题，社区团购的从业者们却在配送环节中遇到了一些小阻碍。
There is no problem with the supply chain model, but the community of community buyers in the distribution process encountered some small obstacles.
疫情感染区域管控力度最强的那几天，所有的街道或交通都被管制起来了，货发不出去也进不来，十荟团一直在积极与地方政府沟通。
In the days when the area of infection was most heavily controlled, all streets or traffic were restricted, goods could not be sent out or entered, and the 10-meta-cluster was actively communicating with local governments.
目前大部分城市均已拿到政府审批的复工许可文件。
At present, most cities have received government approval to resume work permit documents.
另一个是成本问题，疫情期间的社区采购成本会激增，但销售的价格却不能高。
The other is cost. Community procurement costs can skyrocket during an epidemic, but prices cannot be high.
因此有投资人告诉燃财经，除非有资本支撑，否则小的社区团不敢玩也玩不转。
As a result, investors told the burning finance, unless there is capital support, small community groups dare not play or play.
社区团本身满足的就是“省”的需求，需要很大的订单密度来支撑。
The community itself is satisfied with the "provincial" demand, the need for a large order density to support.
疫情面前，一些小区物业限制人员出入小区，社区团的流量存在下滑风险。
In the face of the epidemic, some small residential property access to the community, the flow of community groups there is a downside risk.
订单不稳定，供应不稳定，满足不了整车的运营就会亏损，干得多亏得多。
Orders are unstable, supplies are erratic, you can't run the whole car at a loss, thanks to a lot more.
预售或者团购的结果交付不了，还要面临大量的投诉。
Pre-sale or group purchase results can not be delivered, still face a large number of complaints.
图 / 视觉中国同时，团长易叛变这个问题依旧存在。
At the same time, the problem of the defection of the colonel persists.
有些团长觉得产品销量好，会直接去产区拿货，绕过平台，或者在里面做两三个月，赚钱没达到预期，就换到其他平台里面去，就跟滴滴司机一样。
Some of the commanders felt the product was selling well and would go directly to the production area to get the goods, bypass the platform, or do two or three months inside and make less money than expected, then switch to other platforms, just like drip-dripping drivers.
除非能做到一家独大，但现在暂时不可能出现一家独大。
It is not possible for the moment to have a monopoly unless a single one prevails.
“兼职永远是干不好的，能赚到钱我就做，赚不到钱我就不专心做。
"Part-time job is always bad, I can earn money I do it, I can not earn money I do not concentrate on it.
凭什么这些团长要对你忠心？”上述投资人称。
"Why should these commanders be loyal to you?" said the investor.
买菜之战考验全链条的效率竞争疫情仍在持续，供给的整条产业链被堵塞，难关重重。
The battle to buy vegetables tested the efficiency of the entire chain competition epidemic is still ongoing, the supply of the entire industrial chain was blocked, difficult difficulties.
保供应难，保运送时效与体验更难。
Supply is difficult to secure, and delivery time and experience are more difficult.
首先是物流遇到问题。
The first is logistics problems.
疫情刚开始的时候，大量的物流企业都在支援武汉，物资送过去，司机和车子都要进行隔离，加上节后很多人员没办法到岗，留下的都是当时春节的值班人员。
At the beginning of the outbreak, a large number of logistics enterprises are supporting Wuhan, supplies to the past, drivers and cars have to be isolated, plus many people can not be posted after the festival, leaving the Spring Festival duty staff.
其次是人力问题。
The second is manpower.
据北京市交通委公布的信息，春运开始14天，通过铁路民航出京的人数超过1000万，目前还有800多万人没有回京。
More than 10 million people have left Beijing by rail for the first 14 days, and more than 8 million have yet to return to Beijing, according to the city's transportation commission.
2月2日至2月18日已有200多万人订票返京，但仍有593万潜在回京旅客会逐步订票返京。
More than 2 million people have already booked tickets back to Beijing between February 2 and February 18, but 5.93 million would still be booking tickets back to Beijing.
这也意味着还有近600万人不知何时才能复工。
It also means that nearly 6 million people do not know when to get back to work.
“如果物流不恢复，商流就起不来，商流起不来，老百姓就没办法消费，没办法消费，就会导致企业运营难度加大。
"If logistics is not restored, business flows will not get up, commercial flows will not get up, people will not be able to consume, there is no way to consumption, will lead to enterprises operating more difficult.
可以控人但是绝对不能断货。
You can handle people but you can't stop.
”汉森供应链董事长黄刚建议道。
Huang Gang, chairman of Hansen's supply chain, suggested.
第三，现在供小于求的情况下，各家竞争的还是供应链。
Third, now that supply is smaller than demand, the competition is for supply chains.
供应链包括几个方面：有没有菜、菜品质是否好、能不能高效的供应和运输菜、未来是否能长远地留下有价值的用户。
The supply chain consists of several aspects: availability and quality, efficient supply and delivery of vegetables, and long-term viability of valuable users.
“需求端没有问题，只要你有东西就能卖出去，是否能让客户继续在你这购买，关键还是在于你的产品品质和服务能力。
"There is no problem on the demand side, as long as you have something to sell, whether customers can continue to buy in you, the key is your product quality and service capacity.
”施卓杰称。
"said Schroeder.
图 / Pexels最后，因为生鲜产品有很强的季节性，需要冷链等特殊物流，一旦因为物流问题导致的货品保存不当，就会招来大量的投诉。
Finally, because of the strong seasonality of fresh produce, special logistics such as cold chain are needed, which will lead to a large number of complaints if the goods are not properly stored due to logistics problems.
另外，账期也是一大挑战，即使产品能运输能上架，但是还要等多久才能收款，也是大问题。
In addition, the timing is a major challenge, even if the product can be shipped on shelves, but how long it will take to collect the money is also a big question.
在关键时期，除了生鲜电商的企业会遇到问题，农产品也会遇到问题。
In the critical period, in addition to the fresh electricity business enterprises will encounter problems, agricultural products will also encounter problems.
最近很多草莓、橙子滞销。
A lot of strawberries and oranges are unsold recently.
今年丹东地区的草莓收成很好，结果卖不出去。
Strawberries were harvested so well in Dandong this year that they could not be sold.
针对当下疫情的特殊情况，黄刚建议，疫情未松绑之前，即将成熟的农产品，建议以县域小循环为主。
In view of the specific situation of the current outbreak, Huang Gang suggested that the epidemic before untying, about to mature agricultural products, to the county-based small circulation.
在6月份之前要上市的农产品都应该提前做好渠道运营和产销对接，看能不能提前做预售。
In June before the launch of agricultural products should be done in advance channel operations and marketing docking, to see if you can do pre-sale.
3、4月份的樱桃，5月份的荔枝，都应该提前有预案。
Cherries for March and April and lychees for May should be prepared in advance.
危中有机生鲜电商迎来新变量聪明的创业者和投资人总能在危险之中看到机遇。
Entrepreneurs and investors are always on the lookout for opportunities in the face of new variables.
就像SARS教育了电商市场一样，这次疫情也是一次教育生鲜电商市场的好机会，有利于培养用户线上买菜的习惯。
Just as SARS has educated the electronics market, the outbreak is also a good opportunity to educate the market for live electronics vendors, helping to develop the habit of buying vegetables online.
多名受访者对燃财经表示，随着需求和供给的匹配开始出现失衡，倒逼着生鲜行业生出了新的机会点。
Several respondents told the Financial Times that new opportunities had sprung up in the fresh industry as the match between demand and supply began to unbalance.
首先是会形成新的农产品供应链模式，从农产品超市特供转变成农产品直供社区。
The first would be the formation of a new model of agricultural supply chains, moving from the exclusive supply of agricultural supermarkets to the direct supply of agricultural products to communities.
封闭的环境将更多的人群集中起来，消费方式开始发生变革。
The closed environment has brought more people together, and consumption patterns have begun to change.
应将原来每家每户散乱的需求集中收集起来，把原来的个人购买集中到社区采购，定向发给物美或者永辉这样的商超，他们来订购，形成新的供应链运营模式。
We should collect the scattered demand of every family, concentrate the original individual purchase into the community procurement, targeted to enterprises such as Wumei or Yonghui, they will order, form a new supply chain operating model.
原来BtoC的模式改成FtoB，产地直接供到社区。
The original BtoC model was changed to FtoB, where production was delivered directly to the community.
黄刚看到，近期，浙江杭州周边的社区开始集中下单采购，以大众类消费产品为主，产区直供到社区后自提或送货上门。
Huang Gang saw that recently, Zhejiang Hangzhou surrounding the community began to concentrate on the purchase of consumer products to the general public, production areas directly to the community after lifting or door-to-door.
这是全新的农产品供应链模式。
This is a completely new agricultural supply chain model.
未来，商超的功能要从原来的等用户来买的“钓鱼模式”，变成物流供应链的运营中心，渠道扁平化，直供社区。
In the future, the function of business super-business from the original user to buy "fishing mode," into logistics supply chain operation center, channels flat, direct to the community.
“一些即将上市的农产品，也应该先跟购买力比较集中的社区建立关系，给大家先做试吃，然后集中下订单，做原产地直供。
"Some of the agricultural products going on the market should also build relationships with communities where purchasing power is more concentrated, give people a taste, and then concentrate on placing orders and making direct offers of origin," he said.
”黄刚建议道。
"suggested Huang.
另外，在接下来的几个月里，餐饮零售化是生鲜电商的一个新机会，或者说，很多餐饮企业自救的机会。
In addition, in the next few months, catering retailing is a new opportunity for fresh electric business, or, in many restaurants, self-help opportunities.
“要将餐饮这件事做标准化输出，用零售化的方式来解决餐饮诉求。
"We should standardize the food and beverage output and use the retail method to solve the catering claims."
以前你在门店吃饭，现在将店里的饭搬到家里吃。
You used to eat in a restaurant, but now you move your food home.
”施卓杰称。
"said Schroeder.
商品供应紧缺，原来做餐饮的客户，也开始打破之前的供应体系，利用新渠道一鱼多吃。
Supplies of goods were scarce, and former customers began to break through the previous supply system, using new channels to eat more fish.
一种是将食物处理成半加工甚至全加工形态。
One is to process food into semi-processed or even whole processed forms.
某知名餐饮企业近期就在尝试把店内的牛肉等食材煮好，通过电商渠道到消费者手中，复热一下就行；另一种是净菜形态，标品菜、小分量、精加工、方便用户在家烹饪，可以很好的和外卖结合，也能处理自己的库存。
A well-known restaurant recently tried to cook beef and other ingredients in the store, through the commercial channels to consumers, to re-warm; another is the form of pure vegetables, standard dishes, small components, finishing, user-friendly cooking, can be a good combination with take-out and can handle their own inventory.
一些生鲜电商也在主动寻求和餐饮行业新的合作方式。
Some fresh electric enterprises are also actively seeking new ways of cooperation with the catering industry.
例如每日优鲜就和西贝、眉州东坡等达成合作，由每日优鲜提供原材料，西贝和眉州东坡提供人力，以按件计费的方式，将毛菜加工成标品菜。
For example, daily excellent cooperation with the West Bay, Mei Zhou Dongpo and so on, by the daily fresh supply of raw materials, Xibei and Meizhou east slope to provide manpower, on a piece-by-piece basis, the processing of cabbage into standard dishes.
消费者对餐饮有两种诉求，一种是在家做饭，另外一种是出去吃。
Consumers have two demands for food, one is to cook at home and the other is to eat out.
这段时间内，在消费者外出就餐的诉求没有被满足的时候，一些改善型的餐饮品类，如“在家涮火锅”就成了不错的替代品。
During this time, when the consumer's desire to eat out has not been satisfied, some improved food items, such as "hot pot at home" is a good substitute.
在家做火锅相对简单，火锅需要的食材也以冻品为主，有相应的库存。
Making hotpot at home is relatively simple, hot pot needs food materials also to freeze-based, there is a corresponding inventory.
“我们的被投公司锅圈，最近单日销售额迅速增长到2000万上下。
"Our targeted company has seen its sales soar to around 20 million a day recently.
他们是在社区边上开一个卖火锅食材以及成品菜的连锁店。
They are driving a chain of hotpot ingredients and finished vegetables near the community.
”不惑创投创始合伙人李祝捷告诉燃财经，像这种社区边上的便利刚需服务，未来还会进一步增长。
Li Chunjie, founder partner of Confused Venture, told Flaming Finance that convenience services such as those on the edge of the community would grow further in the future.
此外，新业态永远都在尝试当中。
In addition, the new industry is always trying.
黄刚认为，等疫情结束以后，农产品产区的走播会是一个很好的形式，这个季节什么农产品好卖，就走到产区去直播。
Huang Gang thinks, after the epidemic situation is over, the walking meeting of produce area is a good form, what produce is easy to sell this season, go to the production area to broadcast live.
既解决了信任问题，又解决了粉丝的粘性问题。
It not only solves the trust problem, but also solves the fan stickiness problem.
还有一种叫仓库直播，农产品的加工、分拣等都在仓库，效果也很不错。
There is also a kind of live storage, agricultural products processing, sorting and so on in the warehouse, the effect is also very good.
黄刚称，之所以大家对这一块没有太多关注，是因为农产品价格越来越透明，利润肯定没有美妆产品的直播来钱快。
Mr. Huang said the reason people don't pay much attention to this piece is because prices of agricultural products are becoming more transparent and profits are certainly not as fast as the live broadcast of make-up products.
但疫情过去之后，随着压抑的消费欲得到释放，将孕育一个很大的机会。
But once the epidemic is over, there will be a big opportunity as pent-up consumption is unleashed.
图 /Pexels今年的生鲜电商也应该将自己和产区、渠道的关系从弱关系变成强关系，和B端形成深度绑定，甚至对其进行投资。
Photo / Pexels This year's live-TV companies should also transform their relationships with production areas and channels from weak to strong, forming deep bonds with B, and even investing in them.
这样相当于“订单式”农业，产销之间越来越扁平化，而不是随行就市。
This is the equivalent of "order" agriculture, production and marketing between the more flat, rather than on the market.
线上买菜的人数激增，这个趋势已经提供了足够多的机会空间。
The number of online shoppers has skyrocketed, a trend that has provided plenty of room for opportunity.
生鲜电商领域的玩家们将如何应对今天的变化，这些变化又会对行业格局产生哪些影响，我们将持续关注。
We will continue to pay attention to how the players in the field of fresh electricity business will cope with today's changes and what impact these changes will have on industry patterns.
