疫情防控“全国一盘棋”的关键时刻，各地政府应该在用工、原材料、物流等环节最大程度地给口罩企业提供支持，绝对不能画地为牢。
The epidemic prevention and control of the "national chess game" critical moment, governments around the world should use labor, raw materials, logistics and other links to provide maximum support to mask enterprises, absolutely not firmly.
2月11日，工作人员在位于重庆市南岸区的宏冠医疗设备有限公司口罩生产包装车间内作业。
On February 11, staff members worked in the mask production and packaging workshop of Hongguan Medical Equipment Co. Ltd., located in the south bank of Chongqing.
作者：王全超来源：新华社CNML图片本文约2023字预计阅读时间6分钟中青报 · 中青网记者王林中国是全球最大的口罩生产国和出口国，年产量约占全球一半，为何口罩仍然十分紧缺？口罩生产出来后，要走一个解析、消毒的流程，一般需要7~15天工信部数据显示，我国口罩最大产能约为每天2000多万只，但因为春节假期和疫情影响，许多口罩企业产能未完全释放。
China is the world's largest producer and exporter of face masks, accounting for about half of the world's annual output. Why are masks still in short supply? When the masks are produced, they need to go through a process of analysis and disinfection.
国家发展改革委社会发展司副司长郝福庆表示，截至2月3日，全国22个重点省份口罩产量已经达到1480.6万只，其中最紧缺的N95口罩达到11.6万只。
Hao Fuqing, deputy director of the social development department of the National Development and Reform Commission, said as of February 3, the output of masks in 22 key provinces nationwide had reached 14.806 million, with the most acute shortage of N95 masks reaching 116,000.
“总体看，口罩产量呈现持续上升势头，尤其是防治一线急需的医用N95口罩，优先保障，增速更快。
"Overall, the production of masks continues to increase, especially to prevent and treat the first-line emergency medical N95 masks, priority protection, faster growth.
”郝福庆表示。
Mr Hao said.
一些企业也“转行”生产口罩。
Some companies are also "switching industries" to make masks.
富士康宣布其深圳龙华园区首次引入医用口罩生产线，并于2月5日试产，可日产10万个口罩。
Foxconn announced the first introduction of a production line for medical masks in its Shenzhen Longhua Park, and on February 5, it produced 100,000 face masks a day.
比亚迪也宣布，正调配资源着手防护物资生产设备的设计和制造，预计在2月17日前后量产出货口罩和消毒液，到2月底口罩产能可达500万只/天。
BYD also announced that it was deploying resources to begin the design and manufacture of protective equipment and expected to mass-produce masks and disinfectants around 17 February, with a capacity of 5 million masks per day by the end of February.
中国纺织品商业协会副会长兼秘书长、安全健康防护用品委员会会长雷利民表示，口罩分为医用、民用等许多种类和规格，虽然产品标准各有不同，但全国有相当大一部分口罩厂商都是民营中小微企业，甚至有不少都是“一户一厂”的灵活形式。
The mask is classified into many types and specifications, including medical and civil uses. Although product standards vary, a significant proportion of the country's mask manufacturers are private MSMEs, and many of them are "one-family, one-factory" forms, said Rilimin, vice-president and secretary-general of the China Textile Commerce Association.
受疫情和假期影响，这些小微厂商的产能还未完全释放，产能挖潜的空间还很大。
Due to the epidemic and holidays, these small micro-manufacturers have not yet fully released capacity, there is still a lot of room to exploit capacity.
口罩从车间到用户手中也需要一个过程。
Masks also require a process from the workshop to the user.
中国医药集团董事长刘敬桢近日在接受媒体采访时表示，中国生产口罩的速度已经很快了，仅需0.5秒/只。
In a recent interview with the media, Liu Jingzhen, chairman of the China Medical Group, said the rate of production of masks in China was fast, taking only 0.5 seconds.
然而口罩生产出来之后，还要走一个解析、消毒的流程，一般需要7~15天。
However, after the production of masks, but also to go through a process of analysis, disinfection, generally takes 7 to 15 days.
据介绍，医用口罩在上市前需要经过环氧乙烷灭菌处理。
Medical masks need to be sterilized with ethylene oxide before they are marketed.
灭菌后，口罩上会有环氧乙烷残留，这是一种有毒的致癌物质，必须通过解析方式，使残留的环氧乙烷释放，达到安全含量标准，经检测合格后，才能出厂上市。
After sterilization, the mask will have ethylene oxide residue, which is a toxic carcinogen, must be analytically released, the residual ethylene oxide to meet the safety standards, after testing qualified before the factory listing.
“也就是说，大年初一加班生产的那批次口罩，可能这两天刚刚上市。
"In other words, the new year's first overtime production of that batch of masks, may just come on the market these two days.
”刘敬桢说。
"said Liu.
“这些步骤都走完，工人才能到岗上班”荆州思创科技开发有限公司是当地一家老牌口罩企业，曾多次参与国家应急救援的物资保障。
"After these steps, workers can go to work." Jingzhou Sicheng Science and Technology Development Co., Ltd. is a local old brand mask enterprises, many times participate in the national emergency rescue material guarantee.
从1月20日开始，荆州思创就在加班加点赶制KN95口罩。
From Jan. 20, Jingzhou SiChong was working overtime to make KN95 masks.
但因为假期调休和疫情防控的需要，有四五十名员工滞留在外地回不来，仅剩80名员工参与生产，每天工作十几个小时，目前日产KN95口罩为6万只/天，产能只恢复到原来的60%。
But with 40 to 50 employees stuck out of town for vacation and disease prevention and control, only 80 employees were working more than 10 hours a day, compared with 60,000 daily KN95 masks and 60% capacity.
因为疫情严重，荆州许多小区封锁禁止人员外出，车辆必须有通行证才能通行，导致80名员工中又有约20人不能上班。
Because of the severity of the outbreak, many neighbourhoods in Jingzhou are closed to people and vehicles must be allowed to pass, resulting in about 20 out of 80 employees being unable to go to work.
对于实在有复工需要的企业，有的小区要求，必须要开具健康证明才能出门上班。
For enterprises that really need to go back to work, some community requirements, must issue a health certificate to go out to work.
“所有这些步骤都走完，工人才能到岗上班。
"After all these steps have been taken, the workers can get to work.
”公司负责人陈思敏说。
'says Chen Simin, the company's director.
没办法，陈思敏只好安排公司3辆有通行证的车每天接送员工上下班。
There is no other way, Chen Simin had to arrange the company's three laissez-passer to transport staff to and from work every day.
“我们呼吁口罩厂应该复产复工，但到了乡镇一级很多没有去执行，很多乡镇管理者就是关起门来不让走，说什么都没用。
"We called on the mask factory to resume production, but at the township level a lot of it was not implemented. Many township managers simply shut their doors and said nothing.
”雷利民说。
'he said.
更让陈思敏觉得无奈的是原材料的运输问题。
More let Chen Simin feel helpless is the transportation of raw materials.
因为缺乏产业集群，荆州思创的口罩原材料、设备和包装基本都要从外省采购，但因为疫情影响，即便付出高于以往3倍的运费，大多数货车司机都不愿接他们的单子。
In the absence of industrial clusters, the raw materials, equipment and packaging for the masks created in Jingzhou are mostly procured from the provinces, but most truckers are reluctant to take orders from them, even though they pay three times as much freight as before because of the outbreak.
2月5日前后，他们好不容易找到一个司机愿意去浙江拉一批原材料回来。
Around February 5, they managed to find a driver willing to go to Zhejiang to pull back a batch of raw materials.
荆州市有关部门给办好了通行证，但在进入浙江时吃了闭门羹。
The competent departments in Jingzhou have got a pass, but they shut the door when they entered Zhejiang Province.
“对方说不认我们这边开的通行证，不让下高速。
"The other side said they would not accept the pass we had opened and would not allow the motorway.
”没办法，她又找到荆州市有关部门向湖北省政府请求帮助，通过湖北省政府联系浙江省有关部门，好一番沟通协调之后才予以放行。
"No way, she found the relevant departments in Jingzhou city to request help from the provincial government of Hubei Province, through the relevant departments in Zhejiang Province, communication and coordination before releasing it.
等到放行指令到达，货车司机已经在入浙的高速路口等了整整3天。
By the time the release order arrived, the lorry driver had been waiting for three full days at the zhedron intersection.
当地政府想了很多办法，但也没办法解决物流运输的问题。
The local government has thought a lot of ways, but it can't solve the problem of logistics transportation.
“大家都不知道跨省的情况，不知道对方认不认我的通行证。
"No one knows what happened across the province, and they don't know if the other side will admit my pass.
”陈思敏还提到，春节前他们就向广东东莞一家企业订购了2台口罩生产设备，但厂家迟迟没有发货，经过协调，2月7日才发来了一台。
Chen also mentioned that before the Spring Festival they ordered two masks from a Dongguan company in Guangdong, but the manufacturer delayed shipment and coordinated the delivery of one only on February 7.
“厂商那边说，物流不顺，那边的政府也要求他们设备尽量不能往外卖。
"Manufacturers say logistics isn't going well and the government there wants them to keep their equipment from taking out as much as possible.
”作为企业经营者，陈思敏最担心的还是投入和产出。
As a business operator, Mr Chen worries most about inputs and outputs.
2月8日，当地政府要求，为更好地防控疫情，员工必须集中住宿、集中隔离，这意味着她工厂里的四五十名员工每天光酒店住宿成本就要一两万元。
On Feb. 8, the local government ordered workers to stay together and concentrate in isolation to better control the outbreak, meaning that 40 or 50 employees at her factory would spend 10,000 yuan a day just to stay in the hotel.
而他们生产的KN95口罩仍然按照之前3元/个的价格定价，并由政府统一调拨。
The KN95 masks they produced were still priced at the previous 3 yuan / unit price and were centrally allocated by the government.
员工假期上班要3倍工资，晚上加班要加班工资，每天一两万元的住宿成本，原材料也涨价了，物流政策也是一天一变，政府提供的补贴目前只有5000元慰问金，陈思敏坦言：“以前不存在的成本现在越来越多，以前的价格跟现在也没有可比性，但现在根本不是算钱的时候。
Employees are paid three times as much for their holidays, 10, 000 yuan a day for extra work at night, 10, 000 yuan a day for lodging, raw materials are rising, logistics policies are changing, and government subsidies now amount to only $5,000.
”雷利民建议，在口罩供不应求、疫情防控“全国一盘棋”的关键时刻，各地政府应该在用工、原材料、物流等环节最大程度地给口罩企业提供支持，绝对不能画地为牢，只为自己考虑。
"At a critical time when the supply of masks is in short supply and the disease is under control across the country, governments around the world should maximize support for mask companies in such areas as employment, raw materials and logistics, according to Rilemin.
