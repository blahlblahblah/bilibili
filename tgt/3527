"The challenge is not whether the country can change the course of the virus, but whether they will," said Kyodonews.
””当地时间3月11日晚间，世卫组织总干事谭德塞在日内瓦召开的新闻发布会上宣布，新冠肺炎（Covid-19）疫情已经构成全球性大流行（pandemic）。
"The outbreak of Covid-19 has become a global pandemic," WHO Director-General Theresa Tupper announced at a press conference in Geneva on the night of March 11.
截至发布会召开时，按照世卫组织收到的各国通报，全球已确诊11.8万例新冠肺炎，波及110多个国家，导致近4300人失去生命。
By the time of the launch, according to country reports received by WHO, 118,000 new cases of pneumonia had been diagnosed globally, affecting more than 110 countries and resulting in the loss of nearly 4,300 lives.
大流行是什么？根据世卫组织的定义，大流行是指“一种人们没有免疫力的新疾病在世界范围内超出预期地传播”。
What is a pandemic? According to the WHO definition, a pandemic is "a new disease in which people do not have immunity that spreads beyond their expectations worldwide."
欧洲疾控中心（ECDC）此前在接受界面新闻采访时曾介绍过流行病的三个阶段：“疫情爆发”（outbreak）是指，给定的时间段内，一种疾病在特定地点和人群中发生的比例比通常预期的要多。
The European Centers for Disease Control (ECDC), in an interview with Interface News, had previously described three phases of an epidemic: "Outbreak," in which a disease occurs in a larger proportion of a specific place and population than is usually expected over a given period of time.
“流行病”（epidemic）跟“疫情爆发”本质上是同一件事，但往往意味着更严重的情况。
An "epidemic" is essentially the same thing as an "outbreak," but it often means a more serious situation.
“疫情爆发”在某种程度上暗示着它的地理局限性，但“流行病”则推示了可能扩散的危机局势。
The "outbreak" implies, in part, its geographical limitations, but the "epidemic" suggests potentially proliferating crisis situations.
二者的差别很细微，但也很重要。
The difference between the two is subtle but also important.
相比之下，“全球大流行”（pandemic）是指“流行病”进入全球广泛传播的阶段，通常会影响数量巨大的人群。
A "global pandemic," by contrast, is a phase in which an "epidemic" enters a global epidemic, usually affecting a large number of people.
值得注意的是，尽管“全球大流行”听上去比“流行病”更严重，但这种严重加剧主要是指传播规模（scale），而不是该疾病本身的激烈程度（severity）。
It is worth noting that, while the "global pandemic" sounds more serious than an "epidemic," the severity of the increase refers more to the scale of transmission (scale) than to the severity of the disease itself.
是否为时已晚？1月30日，世卫组织宣布新冠疫情构成了“PHEIC”（“国际关注的突发公共卫生事件”），这是世卫组织传染病应急机制中的最高等级。
Is it too late? On January 30, the World Health Organization announced that the new crown event constituted "PHEIC," the highest level of the WHO emergency response to infectious diseases.
此后数周，疫情迅速蔓延到中国以外的地区。
In the weeks that followed, the epidemic quickly spread beyond China.
过去两周内，中国境外的数量增长了113倍，但谭德塞迟迟没有宣布大流行，让世卫组织招致了不少国际上的批评。
The number of people outside China has increased 113-fold over the past two weeks, but the delay in declaring a pandemic in Tandesse has drawn much international criticism from WHO.
世卫组织拥有是否宣布“大流行”的最终决定权。
WHO has the final say on whether to declare a "pandemic."
谭德塞在当日的发布会上表示，“大流行”不是一个可以被轻易或大意使用的词。
"Pandemic" is not a word that can be used lightly or carelessly, Tan said at a press conference on the day.
这个词如被滥用，会引起不适当的恐惧、或是不合理地接受“战斗已经结束”，从而导致不必要的痛苦和死亡。
The term, if misused, can cause undue fear or unreasonable acceptance that "the fighting is over," leading to unnecessary suffering and death.
2003年的非典疫情，尽管影响了26个国家，但传播得到了较快控制，因此没有被宣布为大流行。
The 2003 SARS epidemic, although affecting 26 countries, was relatively quickly contained and was therefore not declared a pandemic.
2009年H1N1流感爆发时曾被宣布为大流行病，这导致了大量资源在短时间内涌入疫苗研发，但该疾病的影响后来被证明其实有限，不少批评声音由此而起，因此世卫组织在判定是否构成“全球大流行病”时十分谨慎。
When the H1N1 flu outbreak was declared a pandemic in 2009, leading to a rapid influx of resources for vaccine development, the impact of the disease later proved to be limited, leading to much criticism, and WHO was cautious in determining whether it constituted a "global pandemic."
多国防疫不力？谭德塞当日还强调，将这种情况描述为“大流行”并不会改变世卫组织对其威胁的评估。
The description of the situation as a "pandemic" would not change WHO's assessment of the threat, he said.
它不会改变世卫组织正在做的事情，也不会改变各国政府应该要做的事情。
It will not change what WHO is doing, nor what governments should do.
他们将继续敦促各国“监测、测试、治疗、隔离、追踪和动员人民”。
They will continue to urge countries to "monitor, test, treat, isolate, track, and mobilize people."
“我想提醒所有国家，请激活并扩大你们的应激机制。
"I would like to remind all countries to activate and expand your stress mechanisms.
将相关风险告知你们的人民，教他们如何保护自己。
Inform your people of the risks involved and teach them how to protect themselves.
筛查、隔离、测试和处理每个病例，并跟踪每个接触者。
Screen, isolate, test and treat each case and track each contact.
让你们的议员做好准备，保护和培训你们的医护工作者。
Let your councillors be prepared to protect and train your health care workers.
”谭德塞说。
'she said.
谭德塞还批评了一些国家在防疫上的“不作为”（inact），指他们“缺乏决心”（lack of resolve）。
Mr Tanner also criticised some countries for their "inaction" on immunization, referring to their "lack of determination."
“世卫组织一直在不停地评估这次疫情，我们对它的传染性和严重性的程度，以及令人震惊的不作为的程度，深感关切。
"WHO has been constantly assessing the epidemic, and we are deeply concerned about the extent to which it is contagious and serious, as well as about the alarming levels of inaction.
当前的挑战不在于国家是否可以改变病毒的进程，而在于他们是否愿意，”他说。
The challenge now is not whether countries can change the course of the virus, but whether they want to, "he said.
“一些国家缺乏能力，一些国家缺乏资源，一些国家缺乏决心。
"Some countries lack capacity, some lack resources and some lack commitment.
”专家如何回应？英国《卫报》就世卫组织宣布“大流行”采访了一些公共卫生专家。
How did the experts respond? The Guardian interviewed public health experts about the WHO's announcement of a "pandemic."
南安普敦大学全球卫生高级研究员迈克尔·海德（Michael Head）表示，世卫声明显示了他们认为许多国家防疫不力、进展缓慢。
Michael Head, a senior researcher on global health at the University of Southampton, said the WHO statement showed what they saw as weak immunization and slow progress in many countries.
“大流行”的宣告可能意味着我们将看到各国行动起来，比原计划要更早实施更大的干预措施，例如禁止公共聚会。
The proclamation of a "pandemic" may mean that we will see countries move to implement larger interventions earlier than originally planned, such as banning public gatherings.
澳大利亚昆士兰州孟席斯健康研究所的奈吉尔·麦克米兰（Nigel McMillan）表示，大流行的宣布将向卫生部门发出警示，光有旅行禁令是不够的。
Nigel McMillan of the Health Institute in Memphis, Queensland, Australia, said the pandemic announcement would serve as a warning to health authorities that a travel ban was not enough.
他表示，可能的准备措施包括：为大量病人准备医院，储存抗病毒药物；告知公众，在将来的某个时候，他们也许需要考虑诸如生病在家隔离，远离社会，避免大型聚会等。
He said possible measures include preparing hospitals for a large number of patients and storing antiviral drugs, and informing the public that at some point in the future they might need to consider issues such as home isolation, social isolation and avoiding large gatherings.
他指出，政府可能会因此面临挑战，因为需要鼓励人们改变自己现有的生活方式。
He noted that the Government might face challenges as a result, as people needed to be encouraged to change their current way of life.
爱丁堡大学传染病流行病学教授马克·伍尔豪斯（Mark Woolhouse）表示，谭德塞要求国家采取更积极主动的措施，但这项声明里缺少的一个重要关键词是“可持续”。
Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious-disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, said Mr Tanner called for more proactive state action, but one of the key words missing from the statement was "sustainability."
“现在很明显，新冠疫情将与我们在一起相当长的时间，我们采取的行动必须是我们可以长期忍受的行动。
"It is now clear that the New Crown is going to be with us for quite some time and that the action we take must be something we can endure for a long time."
