👆本号引起极度舒适，建议星标一下口罩转产背后的中国制造业作者 | 罗立璇设计 | 范晓雯对于口罩的渴望迅速扩散到了大江南北。
The Chinese manufacturer behind the conversion of the mask was recommended to cause extreme comfort. Fan's desire for masks quickly spread to the north and south of the country.
疫情影响下，口罩已经成为了生活必需品。
Influenced by the epidemic, masks have become a daily necessity.
尽管大部分民众已经尽量减少出门的频率，但只要需要到公众场合，几乎都会被硬性要求佩戴口罩。
Although the majority of the population has reduced the frequency with which they travel, they are almost invariably forced to wear masks whenever they need to be in public.
也因此，口罩在多个城市已经成为被官方统一调配的物资，在广州、深圳、杭州等多个地区，已经发起了公众提前预约申领口罩的业务。
As a result, masks have become officially deployed in several cities, and the public has started booking masks in advance in Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Hangzhou.
然而，根据2月2日工业和信息化部新闻发言人、运行监测协调局局长黄利斌的介绍，目前中国口罩产能约为单日2000万只。
However, according to Huang Libin, spokesman for the Ministry of Industry and Informatization and Director of Operations Monitoring and Coordination on February 2, the capacity of Chinese masks is about 20 million a day.
这是一个现实问题：即使中国是制造业大国，口罩产量也无法满足全国同时使用的消耗需求。
This is a real problem: even if China were a manufacturing powerhouse, the amount of masks produced would not meet the country's consumption needs for simultaneous use.
这是一场只能由中国制造业来完成的自救。
This is a self-help effort that can only be done by Chinese manufacturing.
除了中国自身，全世界没有一个国家具备足够的产能与足够长的产业链来供应14亿国民每天至少1个口罩的需求。
No country in the world, except China itself, has enough capacity and a long enough industrial chain to supply at least one mask per day for its 1.4 billion people.
同时，就目前情况而言，疫情正在进一步向其它国家蔓延，在未来他们将会对口罩产生更大的需求。
At the same time, as things stand, the epidemic is spreading further to other countries, where there will be greater demand for masks in the future.
在全球联通的今天，我们也势必会在本地情况得到控制后，继续生产与输出相关的医疗防护产品。
In today's global connectivity, we will also be able to control the local situation, continue to produce related medical protection products.
中国的制造业正在展现强大的灵活性：口罩厂、防护服厂放弃假期，连夜赶制；具备相应洁净级别的工厂开始购入生产设备，建立新工序、紧急招募员工生产口罩；背后庞大的化工供应商也正在集中调整生产计划，进行源源不断的原材料供应。
China's manufacturing industry is showing great flexibility: mask factories, clothing factories are giving up their holidays and working overnight; factories with appropriate cleanliness levels are beginning to buy production equipment, build new processes, and urgently recruit workers to produce masks; and the huge chemical suppliers behind them are concentrating on adjusting their production plans to provide a steady supply of raw materials.
新技术也需要被快速普及：能够满足过滤新型冠状病毒气溶胶标准的医用口罩，必须在中间加入经过电极处理、带有静电的医用高熔指熔喷布滤层——这本不是一种人人都需要拥有的产品规格——因此产量并不高。
New technologies also need to be made widely available: medical masks that meet the criteria for filtering new coronavirus aerosols must be placed in the middle with electrodes and electrostatic medical high-melt-spun filter layers - not a product that everyone would otherwise need to have - and thus not very productive.
目前，我们正在以小心翼翼的态度陆续回归到日常生活。
At present, we are returning to our daily life with great care.
但要记得的是，在全球范围内的口罩短缺、呼吸器短缺的情况下，帮助我们回到正轨的还有一条又一条运转得发烫的生产线。
But remember, in the face of a worldwide shortage of masks and respirators, one hot line after another is helping us get back on track.
01 |谁在生产额外的口罩？最先动起来的是离市场最近的企业——以稳健医疗为代表的大型医用敷料市场企业，口罩作为集团业务的一部分，所使用的原材料、生产逻辑与其它业务有相互勾连的地方，能够快速抽调资源到口罩生产上，迅速增产。
Who is producing additional masks? The first to move was the closest company to the market - a large medical dressing market represented by robust health care - whose masks, as part of the group's business, use raw materials, production logic and other business connections that can quickly pump resources into mask production.
1月27日，稳健医疗发布了一则官方公告，通告了他们的运营和生产情况：在12月20日，也就是钟南山在央视肯定新冠病毒可以人传人的一个月前，稳健医疗决定取消计划在湖北生产基地举办的现场高管会议，转为视频会议。
On January 27, Healthcare Corp. issued an official announcement announcing its operations and production: On December 20, a month before CCTV confirmed that the new crown virus could be passed from person to person, Stable Medical decided to cancel a planned site executive meeting at Hubei Production Base and switch to videoconferencing.
从1月10日开始，他们正式决定，春节不休假，加班生产N95口罩、医用外科口罩和防护服，成为本次湖北疫情的重要物资供应商。
From January 10, they officially decided that the Spring Festival holiday, overtime production of N95 masks, medical surgical masks and protective clothing, become an important supplier of Hubei epidemic materials.
对于他们的“未卜先知”，稳健医疗的管理人员在接受《经济观察报》采访时解释，取消会议是因为流感流行，避免员工因严寒天气而生病；而提前开始生产计划则是因为察觉到了市场的需求正在急速增加。
In an interview with the Economic Observer, conservatism managers explained that the meeting had been called off because of the flu pandemic, to avoid staff getting sick from cold weather, and because of a perceived surge in market demand.
目前，稳健医疗90%的物资都由湖北省防控指挥部进行统筹调度，10%留于满足自身正常生产与运营的消耗需求。
At present, 90 percent of the steady medical supplies are coordinated by the Hubei Provincial Command of Prevention and Control, 10 percent of which are kept to meet their normal production and operation needs.
在庞大的需求下，集团资源正在集中汇聚到医疗物资生产上。
In the huge demand, the resources of the group are concentrated on the production of medical materials.
稳健医疗同时还是知名消费品牌“全棉时代”的母公司，而由于口罩供应缺乏，部分门店只好暂时关门。
The firm is also the parent of a well-known consumer brand, All Cotton Age, and some stores have had to close temporarily because of a lack of supply of masks.
另外，根据观察，与口罩同样适用无纺布作为原材料的全棉时代的卫生巾也曾出现过短暂缺货。
In addition, according to the observation, the same as the mask non-woven fabric as raw materials of cotton-era sanitary towels have been short-lived.
和稳健医疗逻辑相似，具备类似的原材料储备、生产基础条件的企业，还有纸尿裤厂商与卫生巾厂商。
Similar to sound medical logic, with similar reserves of raw materials, production base conditions, and paper diaper manufacturers and sanitary towels manufacturers.
比如福建福清市的纸尿裤商家“爹地宝贝”就改造了自己的生产线，新增设备、协调材料和工人，开始生产口罩。
For example, Fuqing Fuqing City, Fujian paper diapers business "Daddy and Baby" on the transformation of their production line, new equipment, coordination materials and workers, began to produce masks.
根据央视新闻的报道，虽然工艺、材料有相似之处，但经过参数调整和设备修改、被改造成口罩生产线之后，价值1000多万的婴儿纸尿裤进口生产线两端报废，之后的价值只有原来的五分之一。
According to CCTV News, despite similarities in workmanship and materials, more than 10 million baby diapers were scrapped at both ends of the import line after parameter adjustments and equipment modifications were made to the mask production line.
另外，产业链上游的相关企业也在改变自己的资源投入。
In addition, the relevant enterprises upstream of the industrial chain are also changing their own resource investment.
据新华社采访，一家在江苏淮安的生产设备制造商金卫有限公司，平时主要生产口罩、卫生巾和纸尿裤生产流水线，而现在他们正在加班加点制造口罩生产流水线。
Jin Wei Co., a manufacturer of manufacturing equipment in Huaian, Jiangsu, which produces masks, sanitary towels and diapers, is now working overtime to build a production line for masks, according to Xinhua.
金卫公司的口罩生产流水线的出厂价为45万元，而纸尿裤流水线的出厂价则超过700万元。
The factory price of Kingview's mask production line is 450,000 yuan, while that of paper diaper line is over 7 million yuan.
但目前，对这样不计成本的生产方式，相关机构还未推出相关的补偿或补贴细则。
At present, however, no compensation or subsidy rules have been introduced for such cost-free production methods.
一个保底是，中国国家发展改革委社会发展司副司长郝福庆2月4日在国务院联防联控机制新闻发布会上强调，疫情过后富余的产量，政府将进行收储，只要符合标准，企业可以开足马力组织生产。
On February 4, Hao Fuqing, deputy director of the Social Development Department of the National Development and Reform Commission of China, stressed at a press conference of the State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism on February 4 that the government will collect and store surplus production after the outbreak.
另一个可以参考的消息是：在广东企业中顺洁柔发布公告称子公司拟生产和销售医用口罩后，中金公司作出预估表示，当地政府或在资金投入方面对该项目进行补贴支持；因而上调目标价9%至16.4元。
Another source of information to refer to is that following the announcement by the Guangdong company Zhongshun Jairou that its subsidiary would produce and sell medical masks, CICC estimated that the local government would subsidize the project in terms of capital investment; the target price was raised by 9 per cent to $16.4.
另外一个重要的口罩应急生产力则是具备基础生产条件的企业。
Another important emergency mask productivity is that of enterprises with basic production conditions.
它们基本身处高精尖行业，比如汽车、医药、电子等行业，有能够改造成医用口罩生产所需要的万级洁净车间。
They are in high-end industries, such as automobiles, pharmaceuticals and electronics, and have clean-up workshops that can be adapted for the production of medical masks.
洁净车间即空气悬浮粒子浓度受控的房间，温度、适度、压力均在受控范围内；而万级则表示，室内每立方米空间的微粒数不大于1万个。
The cleanroom, a room with controlled airborne particulate concentration, is controlled for temperature, moderation and pressure, while Vientiane says there are no more than 10,000 particles per cubic metre of indoor space.
这些企业生产的第一个动力是，受到当地政府的请求或资源协调，开始积极组织转产工作。
The first impetus for the production of these enterprises is the active organization of conversion at the request of the local government or in coordination with resources.
比如《红星新闻》所报道的四川海汇药业，就将厂区内闲置的万级洁净车间用于彩虹集团N95医用口罩生产线的整体搬入，后续生产的口罩将会被送往四川抗疫前线。
For example, the Sichuan Haihui Pharmaceutical Industry reported by the Red Star News will use the unused 10,000-grade clean workshop in the factory area for the entire production line of Rainbow Group N95 medical masks, which will be sent to the front line of the Sichuan epidemic.
而上汽通用五菱，则通过联合其隔音棉供应商广西德福特，以改建生产线的方式转产口罩。
SAIC General Wuling, on the other hand, converted its masks by revamping its production line by combining its soundproof cotton supplier, Guangxi De Ford.
据《羊城晚报》报道，该项目将会把广西德福特的原有生产车间改建为2000平米的无尘车间，并于2月内建成投入使用，预计的口罩日产量可达到170万个，由广西区政府、柳州市政府进行物资调配。
The project will transform the Guangxi De Ford plant into a 2,000-square-metre dust-free workshop, which is expected to produce 1.7 million masks a day by February, according to the Yangcheng Evening News.
这些企业生产的另一动力来自于尽快复工。
Another incentive for these enterprises is to get back to work as soon as possible.
富士康此前就在官微发布消息表示，在导入口罩生产线后，他们已经在2月5日顺利实现试产，预计2月底可达日产口罩200万只，最大限度满足集团员工防疫需求。
Foxconn said in an official announcement that after the introduction of the mask production line, they have successfully implemented a trial production on February 5, expected to reach the end of February production of 2 million daily masks, to best meet the group of employees epidemic prevention needs.
在满足了员工需求的前提下，富士康也会积极将一部分物资对外支援输出。
In the premise of meeting the needs of staff, Foxconn will also actively support the export of some materials.
富士康的工厂在珠三角、长三角、环渤海以及中西部地区均有分布，部分工厂已经开始陆续复工。
Foxconn factories in the Pearl River Delta, the Yangtze River Delta, Bohai Sea around the Midwest are distributed, some factories have begun to resume work.
河南省政府官网信息显示，2月10日，河南省省长尹弘深入郑州市企业进行检查指导工作，包括迎来复工第一天的郑州富士康。
Henan provincial government officials reported that on February 10, Henan Governor Yun Hong went deep into Zhengzhou City to conduct inspection guidance, including ushered in Zhengzhou Foxconn, the first day of work.
据《华夏时报》，郑州富士康负责iPhone 11系列手机的组装，以及预计在2020年3月上市的iPhone SE2手机的订单。
According to the China Times, Zhengzhou Foxconn is responsible for the assembly of the iPhone 11, as well as orders for the iPhone SE2, which is expected to go on sale in March 2020.
但这些额外的口罩，绝大部分都是为了应急和填充医疗前线的防护需求，或者出于尽快复工、保障供应的需求而被创造出来的产量，无法满足公共市场的需求。
But the vast majority of these additional masks are for emergency and front-line medical protection needs, or are created to meet the demands of the public market by resuming work as quickly as possible to ensure supply.
02|打开产量的瓶颈口罩的构造非常简单。
The construction of a bottleneck mask that opened production was very simple.
以一次性医用外科口罩为例，内层使用能够吸收被人体呼出的水蒸气的普通无纺布，外层使用经过防水处理、能有效阻挡飞沫的防水无纺布，最关键的，则是中层使用的聚丙烯熔喷无纺布，在经过驻级处理后，这层面料自带静电，能有效吸附空气中带有病毒、细菌级别大小的微粒。
In the case of disposable medical surgical masks, the inner layer uses a non-woven fabric that absorbs water vapor exhaled by the human body. The outer layer uses a waterproof, non-woven fabric that effectively blocks droplets. Crucially, the polypropylene fusible nonwoven fabric is used in the middle layer.
同时，聚丙烯熔喷无纺布也是N95口罩的关键材料。
At the same time, polypropylene melt-sprayed nonwoven fabric is also the key material of the N95 mask.
如果要提高产量，首先就要保证聚丙烯熔喷无纺布的产量能够跟上迅速高企的需求。
If we want to increase production, we must first ensure that the production of polypropylene melt-blown non-woven fabric can keep pace with high and rapid demand.
聚丙烯熔喷无纺布的原料是由石油炼化出来的聚丙烯塑料颗粒，在熔化颗粒后借助高速热气流拉丝，喷射成网，制成无纺布。
Polypropylene melt sprayed non-woven fabric is from petroleum refining polypropylene plastic particles, after melting particles by high-speed hot air drawing, spray into a net, made of non-woven cloth.
这样的布料制作工艺流程短、价格低廉。
Such fabrics have short process flow and low price.
从最上游而言，聚丙烯的原材料供应由中石化推进，不太需要担心。
Upstream, the supply of raw materials for polypropylene is propelled by Sinopec, which has little to worry about.
根据《内蒙古日报》报道，中国石油呼和浩特石化公司在1月31日已经转产口罩原料成功，日均可生产430吨口罩。
According to Inner Mongolia Daily, PetroChina's Hohhot Petrochemical Company was able to produce 430 tons of face masks a day on January 31.
按照1吨原材料能够生产25万个防护口罩来估算，仅呼石化一家企业，单天即可供应生产1075万个口罩所需的原材料。
Petrochemical alone can supply the raw materials needed to produce 10.75 million masks in a single day, according to estimates that a tonne of raw materials could produce a quarter of a million.
另外，根据《市界》的报道，中国石化预计将会在2月向市场投放9.5万吨生产原料，理论上可供约240亿个口罩的生产。
Separately, Sinopec expects to release 95,000 tons of raw materials into the market in February, theoretically producing about 24 billion masks, according to the municipal boundaries report.
下一步则来到聚丙烯熔喷布的制造。
The next step is the manufacture of polypropylene spray.
根据中国产业用纺织品行业协会统计，在2018年，纺粘非织造布的产量为297.12万吨，在非织造布总量中占比达50%，主要应用于卫生材料领域。
According to the China Association of Industrial Textile Industry, in 2018, the output of non-woven fabrics was 2.9712 million tons, accounting for 50 percent of the total non-woven fabric, mainly used in the field of sanitary materials.
而熔喷工艺占比仅为0.9%。
The melting process accounted for only 0.9%.
也就是说，在2018年，中国熔喷无纺布的产量大约为5.35万吨/年，而且还要用于生产环境保护材料、电池隔膜材料和擦拭材料等。
In other words, in 2018, China's production of melt-blown nonwoven fabric will be about 53,500 tons per year, but also for the production of environmental protection materials, battery diaphragm materials and wiping materials.
不少企业就卡在了熔喷布这个关口上。
Many enterprises are stuck in the melting pot this pass.
根据《界面》采访，此前宣布要开始生产口罩与消毒液的比亚迪一天就需要5吨熔喷布，原材料依然紧缺（2月12日，比亚迪回应称，他们具备稳定的货源）。
According to Interview, BYD, which previously announced it would start making masks and disinfectants, needs five tons of spray a day, and raw materials remain scarce (BYD responded on February 12 that it had a steady supply).
海南农业公司海南甘霖科技集团，希望尽快让农民复工，因而准备自己生产口罩，但即使他们与中国石油化工集团（中石化）取得了联系，也没有找到足够的熔喷布资源。
Hainan's Gan Lin group, an agricultural company, wants to get farmers back to work as soon as possible, so it is preparing to make its own masks, but even with contacts with the China Petroleum and Chemical Group, they haven't found enough spray.
同时，由于供不应求，口罩专用过滤材料熔喷布的市场价格正在不断上扬。
Meanwhile, the market price of a special filter material for masks is rising because demand is outstripping supply.
而且，即使没有预算限制，目前熔喷布的产量很难有质变性质的提升。
Moreover, even without budget constraints, it is difficult to improve the quality of the current production of molten cloth.
作为业内领先的公司之一，恒天嘉华是中国恒天集团与仙桃市嘉华塑料制品有限公司共同出资组建的专业无纺布生产企业。
As one of the leading companies in the industry, Hengtian Jiahua is a professional non-woven production enterprise jointly funded by China Hengtian Group and Xiantao Plastic Products Co. Ltd.
它在1月27日发布的公告中表示，公司厂区如果全线投产，包括口罩用面无纺布、熔喷布、底面用无纺布等产品的产量能够达到120吨/天。
The company said in a statement on January 27 that it would be able to produce up to 120 tonnes of non-woven cloth for face masks, as well as non-woven fabrics for the underside, if it went into production at all times.
而业内中小型企业的熔喷布产量大约1-2吨，即使进一步扩产，也需要购置设备与培训人员的时间，但需要复工的企业数量一定远远大于无纺布企业的数量。
Smelting production by small and medium-sized enterprises in the industry is about 1 to 2 tons, and even further expansion will require the acquisition of equipment and training of personnel, but the number of enterprises that need to return to work must be much larger than the number of non-woven enterprises.
一个正在努力的方向是加快工厂出口转内销的资质审核过程，减少由于政府管控而产生的时间损耗。
One direction being pursued is to speed up the qualification process for export-to-domestic export and to reduce the time lost due to government regulation.
湖北省仙桃市彭场镇是中国最大的无纺布生产基地。
Pengchang Town, Xiantao City, Hubei Province, is the largest non-woven production base in China.
但根据《第一财经》在2月8日的报道，在以拥有中国医用口罩生产资质为硬性指标、并且立下产量“军令状”的前提下，仙桃市新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情防控指挥部企业生产组仅圈定了10家医用防护服生产企业、28家一次性医用口罩生产企业，以及22家为上述企业生产包装等配套生产的企业来生产疫情防控物资，其余企业一律关停。
But on the premise that possessing Chinese medical mask manufacturing qualifications is mandatory and a "military order" has been set for production, only 10 enterprises producing medical protective clothing, 28 enterprises producing disposable medical masks, and 22 enterprises producing packaging and other ancillary products for the above-mentioned enterprises have all been closed down.
一名当地的口罩厂商对财新网表示，仙桃当地的口罩厂约有二三百家，有国内医用生产资质的企业仅占百分之十几；另一家被关停的口罩厂商负责人则表示，不少被关停的民用口罩生产企业并不是够不上相应的生产标准，而只是因为办证需要花费时间和金钱，所以才没有申请中国医用口罩生产资质。
A local mask manufacturer told Caixin that there are about two to three hundred local mask factories and only about 10 percent of enterprises are qualified for domestic medical use. The head of another shut-down mask manufacturer said many of the shut-down factories are not below production standards, but have not applied for medical masks because of the time and money required to process them.
这显然并没有充分利用仙桃作为无纺布生产基地的产能优势。
This obviously does not make full use of the peach as a non-woven manufacturing base of production capacity advantages.
相关的监管部门正在试图进行疏通和调控，国家卫健委此前已经允许符合国外标准的医用防护物资临时在国内使用。
Regulators are trying to clean up and regulate the use of medical protective equipment that meets foreign standards.
国家药监局也发布通知，要求加快医用防护服的注册审批和生产许可。
The State Administration of Pharmaceutical Supervision also issued a notice to accelerate the registration and approval of medical protective clothing and production permits.
这些大方向的指导依然有赖于地方政府对疫情发展趋势的判断能力和反应能力。
These broad directions continue to depend on local governments' judgment and responsiveness to the epidemic's development trends.
广东的“世界工厂”东莞是得到认可的其中一个城市。
Dongguan, Guangdong's "world factory," is one of the recognized cities.
东莞的市场监管局在口罩紧缺后，启动了产品许可应急审查机制，成立应急许可工作组，开通现场检查及许可审批绿色通道，悉心指导企业取得应急医疗产品生产许可，将原来近6个月的筹办时限压缩至2天，全力支持企业提前复工、迅速转产，生产医疗前线紧缺的防护物资。
Dongguan's market regulator has launched an emergency review mechanism for product licenses after the shortage of face masks, set up an emergency licensing working group, set up a green passage for on-site inspection and licensing, carefully guided enterprises to obtain emergency medical products production licenses, compressed the original nearly six-month lead time to two days, and fully supported enterprises in early resumption of work, rapid conversion, and production of medical frontline protective materials.
在物资紧缺、生产条件受到疫情影响，人力、设备和原材料都出现紧缺的极限条件下，可以预判的是，口罩物资的生产和供给很有可能从一开始就不是一项通过集中管控、“众志成城”就能完成的工作，而是需要多个分散地区充分利用已有物资和条件，才能尽快满足需求。
Given the scarcity of supplies, the impact of the epidemic on production conditions, and the scarcity of manpower, equipment, and raw materials, it is possible to predict that the production and supply of masks will probably not be a centrally managed, "one-size-fits-all" operation from the outset.
