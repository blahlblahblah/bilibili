作者 | 唐亚华编辑 | 魏佳疫情之下，大多数人足不出户，高度依赖线下的房产行业陷入冰点。
AT & nbsp; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
为了拯救现金流，各大房企和房产中介平台开始网上自救。
In order to save cash flow, housing and real estate intermediary platform began to help themselves online.
近一个月以来，恒大七五折购房，143家房企试水“云看房”，VR售楼处上线……线上认购、VR看房、直播卖房成为新风向。
Nearly a month ago, the constant 75% discount purchase, 143 housing enterprises testing water "cloud room," VR sales office on line... online subscription, VR room, live sales has become a new trend.
这些方式让用户看房体验更好、效率更高，但业内人士普遍认为，房企的这些行为重在营销，是在市场悲观时的主动出击，真实的销售效果远远难比预期，而对于房产中介平台来说，VR看房、直播卖房的形式早已存在，只是疫情影响下应用得更为广泛而已。
These methods allow users to see a better and more efficient housing experience, but the industry generally believe that these activities are marketing-oriented, in the market pessimism of the initiative, the real sales results are far less than expected, and for real estate intermediary platforms, VR housing, live sales has long existed, but the impact of the epidemic is more widely used.
多名受访者认为，这次疫情之后，VR、直播等方式会成为房产行业的标配，但房产作为大宗交易，涉及的环节较多，购房者十分慎重，线上终究不能取代线下实地看房。
A number of respondents believe that after the outbreak, VR, live broadcast and other means will become the real estate industry standard, but as a large transaction, involving more links, buyers are very cautious, after all, online can not replace the on-line real estate.
未来，要真正让购房者认可线上模式，企业要提供更全面的房屋信息、引入无条件退款机制、通过科技方式实现更高级的体验感等，最终考验的还是企业的服务能力。
In the future, for homebuyers to recognize the online model, companies need to provide more comprehensive housing information, introduction of unconditional refund mechanism, through technology to achieve a higher level of experience, and so on, the final test is the service capacity of the enterprise.
VR看房需求激增房企扎堆线上卖房“小区距离回龙观平西府站530米，目前在售的是这两栋楼，房子是86平方米的两室一厅，这是实景图、户型图、房源信息，接下来咱们看一下房间内布局……”点击贝壳找房上的VR售楼部，选定房源进入VR语音带看，十几秒后，经纪人进入语音连线，实时解答关于小区的学区、交通、物业等方面的疑问。
VR demand surge housing enterprises set up on-line sales "residential area distance Huilongguan Pingxi Province Station 530 meters, is currently sold is the two buildings, the house is 86 square meters, the house is sold, this is a real-life map, household map, room layout.
疫情之下，原本在线下发生的看房场景搬到了线上。
Under the epidemic situation, originally took place online to watch the scene moved to the line.
贝壳研究院数据显示，春节假期后的前两周内，VR带看量以较高增速一路爬升，共计300余万次带看，环比增长超9倍。
During the first two weeks after the Spring Festival holiday, the VR band climbed at a faster rate, totaling more than 3 million times, according to shell research.
计划买房的韩冰最近就在用VR看房，以前，她也注意到一些房屋平台上有这个功能，但从未点开过。
Han Bing, who plans to buy a home, recently showed up with a VR and has previously noticed that some of the platforms have this feature but never been clicked.
最近尝试下来，整体体验不错，相对来说，新房样板间看起来差别更小，二手房不太能显示细节。
In recent attempts, the overall experience has been good, relatively small differences between new sample rooms, second-hand housing is less able to show details.
“我只定了大致买房的范围和首付预算，选择范围特别广，年前在线下一天最多能看10套房子。
"I've just decided on an approximate range of home purchases and a down payment budget, with a very wide selection of up to 10 homes on the next day of the year online.
疫情之下不能出门，在线看房作为早期广撒网筛选房子的手段省时高效。
Outbreak cannot go out, on-line house as an early means of casting a wide screen screen house save time and efficiency.
”她说。
'she said.
尽管方便，但韩冰认为，完全在线买房在现阶段是不可能实现的事情，她计划看100套以上的房子再做决策，VR看房只是她前期做功课的方式，最终的决策和成交一定会放在线下。
Though convenient, Han believes it is impossible to buy a house entirely online at this stage. She plans to see more than 100 houses before making decisions. VR is just her way of doing her homework.
“等疫情过去，我会挑几个目前比较满意的小区再实地去看看环境和房子质量。
"When the epidemic is over, I will pick a few currently satisfied small areas to see the environment and the quality of the house.
”。
"
VR看房过程截图 / 受访者供图VR看房需求激增，经纪人也开始改变往常的工作方式。
VR Checklist / Interviewee: VR Demand for Housing Surges, Brokers are changing their usual way of working.
樊房房产加盟商、注册房地产经经人、注册房地产估价师王海玲告诉燃财经，以前公司也常提要注重线上的商机，但她和同事们都没有真正重视起来。
Fan Fang real estate franchisee, registered real estate broker, registered real estate valuer Wang Hai-ling told Flaming Finance, the company often outline the online business opportunities, but she and her colleagues did not really pay attention to.
“直到这次疫情把大家都困在家里，最近我们每个人都学习线上带看房，讲解要通关。
"Until the outbreak left us all stranded at home, each of us recently learned to take a look at the online rooms and explain customs clearance.
这段时间每天带看的客户能有十几个，疫情加快了房产经纪行业的互联网趋势。
This period of time can bring a dozen customers a day, the epidemic has accelerated the real estate brokerage industry Internet trend.
”她说。
'she said.
事实上，在线看房并不是新事物。
In fact, online housing is not new.
曾经的“爱屋吉屋”，通过无门店化降低成本、足不出户视频看房提高效率、降低成本和佣金让利给消费者，但还是以失败而告终。
Once the "love house auspicious house," through no store to reduce costs, stay-at-home video to see the house to improve efficiency, reduce costs and commissions to consumers, but still failed.
“房天下、贝壳找房等的VR看房也早已存在，原来只是作为线上引流方式，最终还是线下带看并成交。
"Housing world, shells, such as the VR room has long existed, the original only as an online drainage, or the final line with the transaction.
疫情出现以后，这些以前就有充分准备的企业能迅速启动，恒大恒房通、碧桂园凤凰通、贝壳找房等都是这样。
After the outbreak of the epidemic, these previously well-prepared enterprises can be quickly started, Heng Da Heng Fangtong, Pi Guiyuan Phoenix, shell looking for housing, and so on.
”王海玲分析，在线看房缺少身临其境的感觉，但疫情之下VR看房显示了它的用武之地，由原来可有可无的边缘化地位变成了主角。
Wang Hailing analysis, online room lack of physical experience, but the outbreak of the VR show its usefulness, from the former marginal status into the protagonist.
与此同时，房企的线上营销也火爆起来了。
At the same time, the online marketing of housing enterprises has also become hot.
克而瑞数据显示，目前有151家房企开启了线上营销，143家房企重启或新推出线上售楼处。
At present, 151 companies have launched online marketing and 143 have restarted or newly launched online sales offices, according to Krugby.
恒大打出7.5折优惠，万科的线上看房平台“e选房”推出了“掌上选房专项”的“线上认缴冲抵房款”活动，碧桂园发起“百亿福利大放送千城万券惠万券”特惠活动，保利地产、中国金茂、绿地控股、阳光城等在内的107家房企也纷纷推出自有平台线上售楼处。
Constant 75% discount, Vanke's online housing platform "e-Housing Selection" launched "special online subscription" campaign, Bigui Park launched "ten billion welfare million million million million million coupons," Poly real estate, China Jinmao, Greenfield Holdings, Sunshine City and other housing enterprises have launched their own platform online sales offices.
据58同城、安居客最新数据显示，其共同运营的VR/3D看房产品“临感VR看房”服务目前覆盖全国187个城市、6430个楼盘、10835个户型。
The VR / 3D housing service, which operates jointly, currently covers 187 cities, 6,430 properties and 10,835 homes across the country, according to the latest data from fellow residents and residents.
这样的方式在业内人士看来，现阶段的营销意义大于实际。
Such a way in the industry at this stage of marketing significance than the actual.
美凯龙爱家总裁冯全林表示，现在各家更多的是在刷存在感，相当于做广告营销和品牌露出，要真正到卖房还有非常长的路要走，即使有999元锁房、7.5折优惠，更多的是一种发声，收割一批用户，获取用户信息。
'There's still a long way to go, 'says Feng Quanlin, president of Mekailong Loving Home.' It's the equivalent of advertising and branding, and there's still a long way to go, even with a $999 lock, a 7.5% discount, and more of a voice, harvesting a group of users and getting user information.
但在疫情期间这是必要的，做总比不做强，房企这样做的意义就是给外部信心，对市场是一种促进。
But this is necessary during the epidemic, do better than not to do, the significance of housing companies to give external confidence, is a boost to the market.
经纪人直播卖房成为新方向疫情之下不能出门，直播也成为另一种卖房方式。
Broker live sales into the new direction of the epidemic can not go out, live broadcast has become another way of selling houses.
房产经纪人张元最近做了10多场直播，每场1-2个小时。
Zhang Yuan, a real estate agent, recently made more than 10 live broadcasts of 1-2 hours each.
他告诉燃财经，每一场直播能吸收到5-6个用户，总计累积了50余个买卖房客户。
He told Burning Finance that each live broadcast can absorb 5-6 users, a total of more than 50 buyers of buying and selling houses.
如果通过安居客等端口投放，至少要花费1万元才能获得类似数量级的客户咨询量，成交转化就更低了。
If put through ports such as neijia, at least 10, 000 yuan to obtain a similar order of magnitude of customer consultation, the turnover is even lower.
有数据显示，近期一周有60家房企通过房天下直播成交，覆盖全国48个城市，累计成交超过500套，其中保利以76套成交成为最大赢家，融创、万科、碧桂园等紧随其后。
Statistics show that in recent weeks, 60 housing companies through the world live transactions, covering 48 cities, the accumulated turnover of more than 500 sets, Pauli to 76 transactions become the biggest winner, Chuang Chuang, Wanke, Bigui and other closely followed.
冯全林认为，直播是房产经纪行业一个非常好的补充工具，更多针对的是企业中的个体，如房产经纪人。
Feng Quanlin believes that the real estate brokerage industry live broadcast is a very good complementary tool, more targeted at individuals in enterprises, such as real estate brokers.
在他看来，个体有天然网红的诉求，在网红经济、私域流量火爆的后互联网时代，直播在房地产领域会是很重要的补充。
In his view, the individual has the natural net red appeal, in the net red economy, the private domain traffic hot post-Internet era, the live broadcast in the real estate field will be very important supplement.
“以前直播更多的用于快消品的带货，其实它对卖房同样有效，因为这种方式能把房源信息介绍得更详细，互动性也很强。
"It used to be more of a delivery for quick fixes, but it worked just as well for selling houses because it provided more detailed and interactive information."
虽然直播距离房产成交还很遥远，但是如果企业把它定位为成交前了解房子信息的必要程序，它的价值就会非常大。
Although it is still a long way from a real estate deal, if companies position it as a pre-transaction to understand the house information necessary procedures, it will be very valuable.
用户先在线上把房源了解清楚，再去线下看房和成交，效率必然大大提升。
Users first on-line to understand clearly, and then go online to see the house and deal, efficiency will be greatly improved.
”冯全林告诉燃财经。
Feng Quanlin told Flaming Finance.
图/视觉中国未来，他认为直播等方式会改变行业低人效的状态，房地产领域每个公司都需要很多个李佳琦。
Picture / Vision China's future, he thinks, will change the industry's low-impact, real estate companies need a lot of Li Jiaqi.
“直播帮助经纪人提升了获客效率，以往一个经纪人如果要获取50个客户，即使花1万块钱，也不能直接买过来，投放出去可能需要两个月时间消化转化。
"It helps brokers become more efficient," he said. "Previously, a broker who wanted 50 clients, even if it cost 10,000 yuan, could not buy them directly.
但现在直播一周、每天一个小时就能获得。
But it is now available live for an hour a day for a week.
”综合来看，VR看房可以在初期看房环节筛选、提效，直播能在获客环节提升效率，两者搭配起来，对行业是极大的促进。
"On the whole, VR can be seen in the early stages of housing screening, improve efficiency, live can be in the recipient link to improve efficiency, the combination of the two is a great boost to the industry.
不过，王海玲认为，直播卖房更适合房产大V，对于普通经纪人来说，一般都是针对自己小区旁边的楼盘在经营。
However, Wang Hailing believes that the direct sale of real estate more suitable for the large V, for the general brokers, is generally aimed at their residential properties next to the operation.
“直播肯定能提效或小范围增加用户，但大规模很难，因为房产是个区域性市场，对我们来说可能加入小区业主群或拉一些客户概率更大一点。
"Live broadcasting is definitely going to increase the number of people or a small area, but it's very difficult on a large scale because property is a regional market and it's a bit more likely for us to be part of a small group of owners or pull a few customers."
”看房容易，下单难在这一轮VR看房过程中，诸葛找房市场研究员姜国君发现了一些新变化。
In this round of VR house-watching process, Zhuge looked for housing market researcher Jiang Guojun found some new changes.
他告诉燃财经，VR看房以前主要应用于一些房产信息平台，特别是在展示二手房信息时使用较多。
He told Flaming Finance, VR room before mainly used in a number of real estate information platform, especially in the display of second-hand housing information when more.
而对于新建商品房，由于相关营销更为系统全面，单方面倾向于VR看房的反而较少。
But for the new commercial housing, because the relevant marketing more systematic and comprehensive, unilateral tendency to VR housing is less.
可自从疫情发生以来，这样的情况发生了很大转变，开发商目前更热衷于通过线上VR看房途径来获取客户，主要原因在于线上是目前唯一的营销环境，用VR技术增强体验感成为了开发商抢夺客源的必用手段。
However, since the outbreak, this situation has changed a lot, developers are now more interested in online VR access to obtain customers, mainly because the online marketing environment is the only current marketing environment, using VR technology to enhance the sense of experience has become a developer for the source of the necessary means.
“在正常的销售流程中，VR看房作为前期吸引消费者眼球的工具，与普通的图文视频相比确实更胜一筹。
"In the normal sales process, VR room as a pre-eye-catching tool for consumers, and ordinary graphics and text video is indeed better than a better.
当前的市场营销处于非常时期，VR看房作为线下实地看房的临时替代品，所取得的效果自然也比之前更加明显。
Current marketing is in an unusual period, VR as a temporary substitute for on-line real estate, the results are naturally more obvious than before.
但VR看房毕竟只是在虚拟环境中完成，而房产作为大宗交易，涉及的问题较多，消费过程复杂，购房者十分慎重，所以终究是不能取代线下实地看房的。
But VR is only completed in the virtual environment, and real estate as a bulk transaction, involving more problems, complex consumption process, buyers are very cautious, so can not replace the on-line real estate.
”姜国君认为。
Kang Guojun thought.
他提到，从目前的情况来看，各开发商推出的VR看房在为项目做宣传、引流量、聚客户等方面都起到了不错的效果，虽然没有带来成交井喷现象，但也为后续销售业绩的增长打下了较好的基础。
He mentioned that from the current situation, developers introduced VR showrooms in the project to do publicity, traffic, focus on customers have played a good effect, although did not bring the transaction blowout phenomenon, but also for the growth of subsequent sales performance laid a better foundation.
图/视觉中国但在蘑菇租房联合创始人龙东平看来，在线看房等方式对于房产交易整个周期并没有大的提升，也并不会大幅缩短买房者做决策的周期。
Picture / Vision China but in mushroom rental co-founder Lung Tung Ping, online housing and other means of transaction did not significantly improve the whole cycle, nor do buyers significantly shorten the decision-making cycle.
他认为，在线看房、直播卖房是多年来房产经纪领域用户需求端的延伸，最终比拼的是线下服务的能力。
He believes that online housing, live sales are years of real estate brokerage users demand-side extension, the final match is the ability to serve offline.
“我十五年前开始做房产中介，当时我们就在报纸上打‘豆腐块’广告，之后一整天等着接电话。
"I started working as a realtor fifteen years ago when we advertised in the paper for bean curd and waited to answer the phone all day.
那时候我们每个人面前有一部电话，所有经纪人的手指都放在免提键上，电话一响就按，看谁速度快，抢到电话这个客户就是自己的了。
In those days we all had a phone in front of us. All the brokers had their fingers on the hands-free key, and when the phone rang, it was up to the customer to grab the phone.
后来有了安居客等一系列网站，很大地改善了买房者的体验。
Later there was a series of sites, such as live-in, which greatly improved the experience of home buyers.
”龙东平告诉燃财经。
Mr Long told Flaming Finance.
他提到，之前在搜房、链家、安居客等平台上可以实现在网页上找房子，上面有照片，有文字描述，再到后来出了视频，到现在又有了VR看房、直播。
He mentioned that in search of houses, chain home, housing and other platforms can be achieved on the web page, there are photographs, text description, and then video, and now there is a VR, live broadcast.
在他看来，这些都是用户体验的提升。
In his view, these are all enhancements to the user experience.
“对于消费者来说这是技术带来的红利，对企业端有了更高的考验，买房体验好的平台能够获得更多买房者的认可。
"It's a dividend for the consumer in terms of technology, a higher test for the business side, and a platform for buying a good home experience can gain recognition from more buyers."
”龙东平表示。
"said Mr Long.
他告诉燃财经，中介行业有句话，一般的中介卖给客户想买的房子，卓越的中介卖给客户应该买的房子。
He told Flaming Finance that the intermediary industry has a saying that the general intermediary to sell to customers want to buy the house, the excellent intermediary to sell customers should buy the house.
客户有时也不知道想要什么样的房子，或者想要的完美的房子其实并不存在。
Customers sometimes don't know what kind of house they want, or the perfect house they want doesn't really exist.
最终客户会在市场的现实作用下做出妥协和解，这显然需要大量服务和时间消耗。
The final customer will make a compromise settlement under the realistic role of the market, which obviously requires a lot of service and time consumption.
龙东平认为，买房的特点是大宗交易、低频、房源极度个性化非标准化、客单价高、本地属性强。
Longdong Ping believes that the characteristics of buying houses are large transactions, low frequency, highly personalized non-standardized housing sources, high unit price, strong local properties.
买房决策是个慢过程，它对线下的服务要求很高。
Buying a house is a slow process, and it demands a lot of services offline.
“新的技术、工具和玩法出来后，谁更善于使用，就会做得更好，马太效应下会加速洗牌。
"When new techniques, tools and games come out, who is better at using them will do better and Matthew will speed up the shuffle.
”他表示。
'he said.
线上看房如何才能成为主流？VR看房、直播早已存在，只是疫情影响下表现得更为集中，应用得更为广泛。
How can online house become mainstream? VR room, live broadcast already exists, but under the impact of the epidemic more concentrated, more widely used.
未来，这股风潮会持续多久？姜国君认为，疫情结束以后，尝到甜头的开发商自然还会延续线上营销业务，VR看房也将更受重视。
In the future, how long will this trend last Kang Guojun believes that after the end of the epidemic, developers who taste the benefits will naturally continue online marketing business, VR will also pay more attention to housing.
可以预见，相关线上技术和做法有望成为比较常规的营销手段，从这个层面来看，VR看房确实给行业带来了新的预期和新的方向。
It can be expected that the relevant online technology and practices become more conventional marketing means, from this level, VR real estate has brought new expectations and new directions to the industry.
“不过，获客方式和体验场景的变化并没有给市场扩容，购房需求并未增长，楼市仍将面临较严的调控以及较大的下行压力，开发商不能因为某项业务一时间成为热门而忽略了解决其它问题。
"However, changes in the way people are treated and experienced have not expanded the market, demand for homes has not increased, the housing market will still face tighter regulation and greater downward pressure, and developers cannot afford to let one business become a hot issue at the expense of others."
”姜国君提到。
"Kang mentioned.
王海玲也表示，在线看房目前的成交效果还不明显。
Wang Hailing also said that the online look at the current transaction effect of the house is not obvious.
“恒大推出的活动也主要是营销效果更大一些，因为他们推出无理由退房，只要不交房，用户都有机会退款，所以实际的成交效果还有待确认。
"The Evergreen campaign is also more effective because they offer no reason to check out, as long as they do not pay, users have the opportunity to refund, so the actual transaction effect has yet to be confirmed.
”在王海玲看来，在线看房更加适合新房，因为大部分新房是期房，消费者到售楼部也只能看到沙盘和样板间，通过VR看到的跟实体差不多。
In Wang's view, online housing is more suitable for new homes, as most new homes are apartments, and consumers can only see sandboards and sample boards in the sales department, with VR seeing much the same as the real thing.
但是二手房情况更复杂，楼龄、装修、具体的感受差异还是很大，所以新房的转化可能稍微高一点。
But the second-hand housing situation is more complex, the age of the building, decoration, specific feeling difference is still very large, so the transformation of the new house may be slightly higher.
冯全林相信，VR/AR是未来的一大趋势，伴随着5G的到来，VR也是科技型互联网企业的必备的基本能力。
Feng Quanlin believes that VR / AR is a major trend in the future, along with the arrival of 5G, VR is also the necessary basic capabilities of technology-based Internet enterprises.
这一次疫情的契机撕开了一个口子，未来会成为行业标配。
This outbreak of opportunity to tear open a gap, the future will become the industry standard.
图 /Pexels“VR看房、直播卖房等所有的方法都是为了提高效率，对于房地产领域是一种进步，但并不能一步到位。
VR Home Viewing and Live Selling All these methods are meant to improve efficiency. They are a step forward, but not a one-step process.
事实上，未来这种形式能不能起到效果，不是企业有没有准备好，而是用户有没有准备好。
In fact, whether this form can be effective in the future is not whether the enterprise is ready, but whether the user is ready.
现在别说买房，即使是租房，也不可能有人用VR看房就决定要租，还是要实地去看朝向、通风。
Now do not say to buy a house, even if it is rented, it is impossible to use VR on the decision to rent, or the field to see the direction, ventilation.
现在用户在淘宝上就可以不试衣服直接买，房产领域也需要倒逼消费者发生变化。
Now users in Taobao can buy directly without trying on clothes, the real estate sector also needs to push consumers to change.
”冯全林说。
"said Feng Quanlin.
那么，什么时候房产线上交易会成为主流，这一领域是否能出现房产界的阿里巴巴呢？易居研究院研究员严跃进认为，要真正让购房者认可线上模式，必须具备几个条件。
So when will online property fairs become mainstream, and will there be Alibaba in the property sector? Yen Yuejin, a researcher at the Easymptomatic Institute, thinks there are several conditions that must be in place for homebuyers to actually endorse the online model.
首先信息齐备，如果是现房、精装修甚至还有房产证，购房者在线上看房就和购物一样，这个时候购房的压力会减少；另外，在目前交易中，预付款退款非常困难，如果可以引入反悔机制，购房者在线上交易的顾虑才能降低，如通过设立购房保险等机制；第三，线上看房只是简单的二维或三维，体验感还是不够强，企业还需要通过科技方式来实现更高的体验感。
First of all, information is available, if is the current room, decoration and even real estate certificate, buyers on-line to see the same as shopping, this time will be less pressure to buy housing refunds, such as through the introduction of estoppel mechanism, buyers online transactions, such as through the introduction of estoppel mechanism, or simple two-dimensional or three-dimensional experience, enterprises need technology to achieve a higher sense of experience.
“疫情本身是‘黑天鹅’，但应该关注的是黑天鹅之后的‘灰犀牛’。
"The outbreak itself is a 'black swan', but it is the 'grey rhino' after the black swan that deserves attention.
”冯全林提到，疫情总会过去，但是疫情警醒了很多企业要去回看自己的核心竞争力、业务模式，各家企业都需要有新的技术、新的业务方式来提高效率。
'There will always be an end to the epidemic, 'Mr. Feng said,' but the epidemic is a wake-up call for companies to look back at their core competencies and business models, which require new technologies and new ways of doing business.
他认为，企业要在技术、资源配套、人员素质上做好准备。
In his view, enterprises should be prepared in terms of technology, resources and personnel quality.
未来，如果能实现三屏联动，亲朋好友可以同时在线看房、讨论、评价，并且看房者能看到其他人的评价，将会是很好的体验。
In the future, it will be a great experience for relatives and friends to watch, discuss and evaluate rooms online, and for people to see other people's comments.
