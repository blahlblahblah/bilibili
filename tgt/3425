口述实录 | 到处扣押物资的德国，感觉像在撞大运……。

我特意问过几个德国人，他们并不是鲁莽而不戴口罩，而是在认真看过防疫指南后认为没必要而不戴的。
I asked several Germans that they were not reckless and did not wear masks, but did not wear them after carefully reading the vaccination guidelines.
德国的优点是严重依赖系统性好，但如果系统中的一环断了，它的整体欠灵活性也就会凸显了。
Germany has the advantage of being heavily dependent on the system, but if a loop in the system is broken, its overall inflexibility becomes apparent.
口 述 | KZ整 理 | 金 姬作为一个中国人，我从没想到自己会在德国遭遇大规模爆发的新冠疫情，而且还是身处疫情最严重的地区。
As a Chinese, I never expected to have a major outbreak of the new crown in Germany, and I'm still in the worst place.
我是宁波人，来德国四年了，和上海妻子住在科隆边上的小镇。
I am a native of Ningbo. I have been in Germany for four years and live in a small town near Cologne with my wife in Shanghai.
科隆位于德国目前疫情最重的北莱茵-威斯特法伦州(Nordrhein-Westfalen)，也就是“北威州”，人口超过1800万的联邦州，这个数字对中国人没感觉，但却是德国人口最多的州了。
Cologne, a federal state with a population of more than 18 million, is located in the German state of North Rhine-Westfalen, now Germany's worst affected state, but it is Germany's most populous state.
北威州的海因斯贝格（Heinsberg），是这次德国疫情暴发最严重地区。
Heinsberg of North Wales is the region with the worst outbreak of the German outbreak.
而我居住的小镇，离海因斯贝格只有四十分钟的路程。
The town I live in is only forty minutes from Heinsberg.
全德国确诊病例最多的地区——海因斯贝格。
Heinsberg, the region with the highest number of confirmed cases in Germany.
截至3月13日，德国确诊3074例，其中北威州1221例，海因斯贝格就占了525例。
As of March 13, 3,074 cases had been diagnosed in Germany, including 1,221 in North Wales and 525 in Heinsberg.
而海因斯贝格的人口仅二十五万多。
Heinsberg had a population of only over 250,000.
目前德国死亡6例，大多也发生在北威州。
There are currently six deaths in Germany, most of them in North Wales.
现在德国的数据变化非常快，比如我住的这个区，上午10例确诊，2个小时后，就13例了……我日常工作是从事进出口贸易，平时基本公交上下班，而目前只能尽量选择宅在家了。
Now the data in Germany is changing very fast. For example, I live in this area where 10 cases are diagnosed in the morning and 13 cases in 2 hours... My daily job is to import and export trade, and I usually commute by bus, but at present I can only choose to stay at home.
超然的德国，也中招了我今年春节没有回国。
Transcendent Germany, also admitted me this Spring Festival did not return to China.
因此对于新冠肺炎疫情的情况，也是通过媒体报道和社交网络了解的。
As a result, news reports and social networks have also shed light on the outbreak of pneumonia in the New Crown.
对于当年亲历北京SARS的我而言，对于这样的疫情就很敏感。
For me who experienced SARS in Beijing, I was very sensitive to such an outbreak.
因此，我很早就提醒国内家人要提高警惕，不要轻易出门，不可大意。
Therefore, I very early to remind the domestic family to be vigilant, do not go out easily, not carelessly.
德国这边报道很超然，一开始感觉疫情发生在中国，离我们很远。
The German side of the story is very detached from the beginning of the feeling that the outbreak took place in China, far from us.
德国人更关心的是土耳其对欧盟撂挑子，放任十万难民涌到希腊边境。
Germans are more concerned about Turkey's decision to leave the EU behind and allow 100,000 refugees to flood the country's borders.
同时，由于在欧洲国家，要做到封城封国是难以想象的事，法律和现实操作都几无可能，所以部分民众的态度看中国疫情也是在“骇人听闻”中带着好奇。
At the same time, the public's attitude toward the Chinese epidemic is "horrendous," owing to the unthinkable legal and practical possibility of sealing the country.
我和周边德国人交谈时，他们尽管态度很小心，但不经意中还是会有点心理优越感。
When I talk to the Germans around me, they can be a little psychologically superior, even if they're careful.
不过，现在的媒体态度可就不同了。
However, the attitude of the media is different now.
德国疫情出现过两次高潮，第一次是今年1月，位于拜仁州的一家德国公司里的中国员工来短期出差，回中国后发烧并被确诊，消息传到德国母公司的同时，正好这里接触过的德国员工也开始发烧，一查后也确诊，然后这个公司及周围接触人员开始隔离，员工及家属不断出现确诊，幸运的是所有感染者都是轻症，最后都出院了。
The first came in January, when Chinese employees of a German company in Bayern went on a short business trip to China and were diagnosed with fever. The German staff contacted there also developed a fever and were diagnosed.
现在全德国痊愈27例，大部分都是那个时间段的病人。
There are now 27 cases of complete recovery in Germany, most of them in that period.
这个过程，一方面说明德国下手跟踪得比较早，措施得当，但同时似乎也给民众留下一个“大不了就是不知原因流感的”印象。
This process, on the one hand, suggests that Germany followed it early and appropriately, but at the same time it seems to leave the impression that the "big deal is the flu."
真正让德国人紧张起来的是眼下这一周，也就是第二次高潮。
What really gets the Germans nervous is this week, the second climax.
大约在2月下旬，海因斯贝格的一对夫妻从意大利回来后，恰逢北威州狂欢节，照例吃喝玩乐之后，男的重症进医院，一查确诊，同时被确诊的还有他的太太，虽然女的症状较轻。
About the second half of February, when a couple from Heinsberg returned from Italy, coinciding with Carnival in North Carolina, the men were hospitalized for serious illness and confirmed, together with his wife, although the symptoms were less severe for women.
由此，他们参加了海因斯贝格狂欢节，与此夫妇有接触的感染者接力着向北威州及以外地区蔓延。
As a result, they attended the Heinsberg Carnival, and a relay of infected people in contact with the couple spread to North Carolina and beyond.
在今年的狂欢节上，德国人把“新冠病毒”做成花车，没想到不久以后自己国家也中招了最让华人崩溃的是，上周末北威州的门兴格拉德巴赫和多特蒙德足球赛，当地政府居然决定让54000名球迷进场，仅仅奉劝来自海因斯贝格的550名球迷退票。
Germany turned the New Crown Virus into a floater at this year's Carnival, only to find that the local government decided to send 54,000 fans to the stadium and persuade only 550 fans from Heinsberg to return their tickets.
问题是，那个球场离海因斯贝格仅10公里！这周开始无观众比赛了，不过，球迷依然大量自发涌到球场外活蹦乱跳。
The problem is, the stadium is only 10 kilometers away from Heinsberg! No spectators started this week, but fans still flocked to the stadium in droves.
其实有个细节，政府要做出一个这么重大决定需要听到所有相关方的声音，比如组办方说他们会破产，因为保险公司不理赔不可抗力，所以最终只能采取最大公约数。
In fact, the government needs to hear the voices of all parties involved to make such a big decision. For example, the organisers say they will go bankrupt because the insurance company will not pay the force majeure, so it will have to take the maximum common denominator.
德国人就是不爱戴口罩作为中国人，武汉封城开始，我第一感也是去买口罩，可惜有事就耽搁了一天，药店的营业员说头一天就卖光了。
As a Chinese, Wuhan sealed the city, my first feeling is to buy a mask, unfortunately the problem delayed a day, the drugstore salesclerk said the first day sold out.
之前，这里的超市因为华人的关系，最先断货的是大米，然后是消毒液。
Previously, the supermarket here because of the Chinese relationship, the first to stop the sale of rice, then disinfectant.
超市大米售罄消毒液限购现在除消毒液“永远”断货，偶尔出现面粉、手纸断货，但隔几天就会补上。
Supermarket rice sold out disinfectant restrictions now in addition to disinfectant "forever," occasionally flour, toilet paper out of stock, but every few days will be filled.
整个德国还没有出现物资供应的问题。
Germany as a whole has not had problems with supplies.
德国人听从政府的思维极致到什么程度？上周一个不到20人的集会上，人们近距离接触，没有一个戴口罩的！但每隔十几分钟会传递消毒液净手，因为政府说了口罩不管用，洗手最重要！现在一些药店已获特许自制消毒液每人限量销售。
At a gathering of less than 20 people last week, no one wore a mask at close range, but every ten minutes the hand was passed on because the government said it didn't work and hand washing was the most important thing! Now some pharmacies have been licensed to make their own disinfectants.
“口罩”这个词，几乎成了德国华人的梦魇！在欧洲，一般情况下，只有自己病了怕传给别人才戴口罩，而且，至少到目前没有一个医学专家站出来说全民口罩对防疫有特别帮助，我特意问过几个德国人，他们并不是鲁莽而不戴口罩，而是在认真看过防疫指南后认为没必要而不戴的。
The term "mask" is almost a nightmare for German Chinese! In Europe, only those who are sick and afraid to pass it on to others wear masks, and at least so far no medical expert has come forward to say that national masks are particularly helpful for immunization.
试想如果你出门戴口罩，等于告诉别人离我远点，我病了，而且还是个华人。
Imagine if you went out wearing a mask and told people to stay away from me. I was sick and I was a Chinese.
因此，目前德国大街上，大多数人还是不戴口罩。
As a result, most people still don't wear masks on German streets at the moment.
我感到有些害怕……德国现在不紧张也不行了，我太太就职于美国上市公司在欧洲的分公司，这周她的老板对上班的要求一天一变。
I feel a little scared... Germany is not nervous now and my wife works for a European subsidiary of a US-listed company, and her boss's demands for work are changing every day this week.
今天的更新是：你不需要请假就可以选择在家办公。
Today's update: You can choose to work from home without asking for leave.
德国很早就公告，发烧不要直接去医院，而是打热线电话，会上门来处理。
Germany announces very early, fevers do not go directly to the hospital, but telephone hotlines, will come to deal with.
热线电话管不管用？我还没试过，希望我不会需要去验证它管不管用。
Does the hotline work? I haven't tried it yet, and I hope I don't need to verify it doesn't work.
检测的决定权在医生，虽然德国诊疗费由保险公司支付，但由于医保在德国如同强制险，所以一旦被确定有需要，所有费用都不用自己出了。
Testing is a matter for doctors, and although the cost of consultation in Germany is covered by insurance companies, since health care is compulsory in Germany, all costs are covered by the insurance company once it is determined that there is a need.
人们遇到的问题会在于，如果你觉得非要测一下，而医生不觉得有必要，那么费用自理起来就很高了。
The problem for people is that if you feel you have to do a test and the doctor doesn't think it's necessary, then the cost is very high.
德国现在医疗倾向于年老或有基础病等高风险人群，你不符合上述条件，估计同意你测试几率比较低，因为医生们认为，如果你身体力强，即使得了也会自愈。
If you do not meet the above criteria, you are less likely to agree to a test because doctors believe that if you are strong, you will heal even if you are physically strong.
我现在非常担心。
I am very worried now.
德国的战略首先是尽量延缓蔓延，将防护重心倾斜高风险人群。
Germany's strategy is, first and foremost, to minimize contagion and tilt the center of gravity to high-risk groups.
尽管德国已成功比意大利多抢出了几乎一个月时间，但现在这个优势已经没有了。
Although Germany has managed to outstrip Italy by almost a month, that advantage is now gone.
我太太公司的同事，昨天断然休假飞意大利看老公去了，这在中国是难以想象的……昨天从一个医生的熟人那里获得信息，他们医院的急诊大夫近来都在“裸装”工作，州里根本没能力提供防护用品。
My wife's office colleague, who flew off to Italy yesterday to see her husband, is unthinkable in China... yesterday received information from an acquaintance of a doctor whose emergency doctor had recently been "nude" and the state simply could not afford to provide protective equipment.
医用防护用品缺失是全球性的，现实中无法解决。
The absence of medical protective equipment is global and cannot be solved in reality.
她很担心，深怕不久就会看到大量德国医生被隔离的情况出现。
She was worried that she would soon see a large number of German doctors isolated.
我读到了德国扣押瑞士口罩的新闻。
I read about the seizure of a Swiss mask in Germany.
德国在事发当天的前一个星期三，发布了禁止所有医疗用品出口，瑞士倒霉撞枪口上了。
The day before Wednesday, when Germany banned all exports of medical supplies, Switzerland was caught in the crossfire.
按平时，这种事很不仁义，但人人都想自保的时候，德国也就厚着脸皮干了。
In peacetime, this kind of thing is very unkind, but when everyone wants to protect themselves, Germany is brazen.
德国的优点是严重依赖系统性好，但如果系统中的一环断了，它的整体欠灵活性也就会凸显了。
Germany has the advantage of being heavily dependent on the system, but if a loop in the system is broken, its overall inflexibility becomes apparent.
医用口罩，而不是全民口罩将会是决定德国命运的命门，目前的德意志列车就在高速撞大运中。
A medical mask, not a national mask, will determine Germany's fate, and the German train is now in the throttle.
