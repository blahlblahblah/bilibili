Welcome to Tencent News APP. "I don't want my wife to go to Wuhan with me, but she won't get off the bus.
”回想起几天前的经历，家住江苏无锡的90后货车司机顾师傅既有对妻子的愧意，更多还是感动。
Recalling his experience a few days ago, Gu Shifu, a 90-year-old truck driver who lives in Wuxi, Jiangsu, was more moved than sorry for his wife.
大年初二晚，顾师傅接了一单生意：货车版“滴滴”——满帮集团联合爱德基金会，要给武汉捐赠消毒液，托人将物资从湖州运到武汉。
On the second night of the New Year, Master Gu received a business deal: "Drop by Drop," a freight-truck version of the United Aid Foundation, which donated disinfectant to Wuhan and had the goods transported from Huzhou to Wuhan.
对老司机顾师傅来说，往返1400公里的路程算不上长，他知道湖北民众需要这些物资，但要进入疫区，家人们担心他的安全，通通反对。
For the veteran driver, Gu, the 1,400-kilometer commute was not long. He knew Hubei people needed the supplies, but families feared for his safety to get into the affected area.
最后，他还是说服家人，接下订单。
Finally, he persuaded his family to take the order.
但妻子不放心，坚持要和他一起，两人连夜启程，开始了农历新年后的第一单。
But the wife is not at ease, insisted on with him, two night departure, began the first single after the Lunar New Year.
回到无锡后，他和妻子开始了为期14天的隔离生活，一岁多的女儿只能交给父母照料。
Back in Wuxi, he and his wife began a 14-day isolation period, leaving their daughters over a year old in the care of their parents.
“我知道武汉是疫区，回来还隔离了，但我没什么后悔的。
"I know Wuhan is an epidemic area, come back to quarantine, but I have no regrets.
”这是他在隔离第三天对《棱镜》说的一句话。
"This is what he said to Prism on the third day of isolation.
也就在对话的同一天，在1月30日举行的发布会上，卫健委新闻发言人米锋表示，根据当前应对疫情工作需要，运送物资到湖北省的货车司机需要采取必要的防护措施，返回之后无发烧、咳嗽等症状，允许其继续运送物资。
On the same day of the dialogue, at a press conference on January 30, Wei said truck drivers transporting goods to Hubei province needed to take necessary protective measures to allow them to continue to deliver goods without symptoms such as fever and coughing after returning, according to the current needs of the epidemic.
以下是货车司机顾师傅的自述，为方便阅读，有调整和删节。
The following is a self-report by the lorry driver, adjusted and abridged for ease of reading.
老婆放心不下，要我带她一起出车我姓顾，家住江苏无锡，是一名货车司机。
Wife worried about, want me to take her to drive together my surname Gu, home in Wuxi, Jiangsu, is a lorry driver.
大年初三，我开车和老婆去了一趟武汉，给当地消防队送消毒水。
On the third day of New Year, I drove to Wuhan with my wife to send disinfectant to the local fire brigade.
现在我在家附近一家酒店做隔离，身体还好，14天的隔离结束后，我可以和老婆一起回家。
Now I'm in quarantine at a hotel near my home and I'm fine. After 14 days of isolation, I can go home with my wife.
大年初二晚上，我在运满满app上看到有人下单，要马上送货去武汉。
On the evening of New Year's Day, I saw someone order to deliver the goods to Wuhan.
这个软件跟滴滴类似，要发货的人在软件上下单，司机接单。
The software is similar to a drip, where the person to deliver the goods orders the software and the driver orders them.
我打电话过去问了问情况，对方要从浙江湖州发货到武汉，是满帮跟爱德基金会给武汉捐的消毒水。
I called over to inquire about the situation, the other party from Huzhou, Zhejiang Province to Wuhan, is a full gang and Ed Foundation donated to Wuhan disinfectant.
我知道消毒水对武汉现在非常重要，但我还是有些犹豫，毕竟是疫区，所以跟他说晚一个小时再回复他。
I know disinfectant water is very important to Wuhan now, but I still hesitated, after all, is the epidemic area, so tell him to reply to him an hour later.
当时，我和老婆、父母，叔叔阿姨，还有一岁多的女儿在家一起过年，准备休息几天。
At that time, my wife, parents, aunts and uncles, and my daughter, more than a year old, were at home for the Spring Festival.
我说了这个单子的事，但家里人很担心，都不同意我去武汉。
I said this list, but the family is very worried, do not agree with me to go to Wuhan.
我想起在网上看到短视频，有志愿者们过去武汉，送东西帮忙，他们还都是无偿的。
I think of the short video on the Internet, there are volunteers to Wuhan, send things to help them, they are free of charge.
现在武汉情况这么危急，当地人需要这些救灾的物资，我觉得自己应该去一趟。
Now Wuhan situation is so critical, the local people need these relief materials, I think I should go.
虽然武汉是疫区，但我觉得也没那么可怕，里面还有上千万人，不可能人人都染病。
Although Wuhan is an epidemic area, but I do not think so terrible, there are tens of millions of people, it is impossible for everyone to be infected.
再说我们过去也很少跟人接触，就卸个货。
Besides, we used to have little contact with people, so we unloaded the goods.
我就试着跟家里人解释，说服他们，讲了好长时间。
I tried to explain it to my family, convinced them, and talked for a long time.
最后，我还是把单接了。
Finally, I took the slip.
老婆放心不下，要我带着她一起出车，女儿就暂时让爷爷奶奶帮忙照看着。
Wife worried about, want me to take her to the car together, daughter temporarily let grandparents help look after the care.
这是我第二次带老婆出车。
This is my second trip with my wife.
年前有过一次，是去上海，旅途短，刚好她在家没事儿。
I had a trip to Shanghai a few years ago and it happened that she was fine at home.
但这一次，到现在，我都不想让老婆一起去武汉。
But this time, until now, I do not want my wife to go to Wuhan together.
你看我一个人去，我只要把自己照顾好就可以了，她要一起去，我反而更担心。
You see I go alone, I just have to take good care of myself, she wants to go together, I am even more worried.
可她死活不愿意下车，说“在家担心，放心不下”，要不然我也别接这个单。
But she is reluctant to get out of the car, said "worry at home, worried," or I do not accept this list.
没办法，这个事也特别紧急，没时间再争了，我还是带着她上路了。
No way, this matter is also particularly urgent, there is no time to argue, I still took her on the road.
2020年1月31日，农历大年初七。
January 31, 2020, the seventh day of the Lunar New Year.
顾师傅和妻子在无锡政府指定的酒店中隔离。
Gu and his wife were quarantined at a hotel designated by the Wuxi government.
11天后，小两口将可结束隔离，回家与父母及一岁多的女儿见面。
After 11 days, the couple will be able to end their isolation and return home to meet their parents and their one-year-old daughter.
摄影/顾师傅消防队的人专门给了五盒方便面，说没啥好招待的当天晚上接了单，我们立马就开车去湖州，走省道一个多小时，找了个地方休息。
The fire brigade had given five boxes of instant noodles, saying there was nothing to be entertained for the night, so we drove off to Huzhou for more than an hour to find a place to rest.
初三一大早，约的八点钟上货，我们七点多到了。
Early in the morning, about eight o'clock goods, we arrived at more than seven.
货物有好几吨，总共几百箱的消毒水。
There were several tons of disinfectant in several hundred cases.
2020年1月27日，农历大年初三。
January 27, 2020, the third day of the Lunar New Year.
顾师傅一早把车开到了浙江湖州约定的上货地点，工人们开始往车上装消毒水。
Gu Shifu drove the car to the agreed loading spot in Huzhou, Zhejiang Province, and the workers began to load it with disinfectant.
摄影/顾师傅中午货装完之前，我们简单吃了口饭，然后开车去武汉。
Before the lunch was packed, we had a simple bite to eat and drove to Wuhan.
700公里多一点，开了大概10个小时，一路上车不多，很畅通，到武汉已经是晚上九点多。
A little more than 700 km, driving about 10 hours, the road is not much, very smooth, to Wuhan is already more than 9 pm.
单接得比较急，本来朋友也建议我们要穿上防护服，但临时不好买，我们就准备几个口罩，带着过去。
Single more urgent, originally friends also suggested that we should wear protective clothing, but temporarily not easy to buy, we prepared a few masks, take past.
家里没什么吃的，到湖州之后还有商店在开门，我老婆就买了些方便面、面包和矿泉水。
There was nothing to eat at home. There were shops open after I got to Huzhou. My wife bought some instant noodles, bread and mineral water.
到的那天，武汉已经封城了，幸好有消防队的人在高速公路口接应。
On that day, Wuhan has been closed, fortunately there are fire brigade at the entrance to the highway to answer.
跟交警确认我们送的是物资，又连忙把身份证拍照留底，量体温，还往驾驶室里喷上消毒水，搞了一大通，交警才把我们的车放进城。
After checking with the traffic police that we were delivering supplies, we snapped our ID cards, took our temperature, sprayed disinfectant on the cockpit, and made a big deal of noise before the traffic police put our cars into the city.
本来约好，我只要送货到高速口就行，但在高速口卸货就得把货转移到消防车上。
It was supposed to be just a delivery at the freeway, but I had to transfer the cargo to the fire engine at the high speed.
那边只有两辆消防车，装载能力有限，要弄好长的时间，得到凌晨。
There were only two fire engines, with limited loading capacity, which took a long time to get to the wee hours.
我们商量，不如直接下高速去仓库。
Let's talk. Let's just go down to the warehouse.
初三晚上九点多钟下的高速，然后开到距离高速路口几公里的仓库。
The third day of the evening more than nine o'clock high speed, and then drive to the high-speed intersection a few kilometers of the warehouse.
我下车把货车围布帮忙给解开了，本来消防员说他们自己解，让我们就待在驾驶室别下来，免得感染。
I got out of the car and helped unravel the van coverings, but the firemen said they'd unravel it and let us stay in the cab so we wouldn't get infected.
但围布是我自己系上去的，怎么解我最了解。
But I fastened the cloth myself. I know best how to solve it.
解下围布，十几个消防官兵涌上来就开始卸货。
Take off the cloth, a dozen soldiers and officers came up to start unloading.
大晚上的，他们站成一排，一个接一个，半个小时就把货卸到仓库里。
In the evening, they stood in a line, one after another, and unloaded the goods into the warehouse in half an hour.
卸完货，还没怎么休息，他们又直接拿着一堆消毒水出去消毒了，非常辛苦。
After unloading, not much rest, they took a pile of disinfectant directly out to disinfect, very hard.
武汉情况紧急，所以也不允许我们久留，卸完货我们连夜准备上高速。
Wuhan emergency, so we are not allowed to stay long, unload the goods we are ready to go on the high speed overnight.
走之前，消防队的人，专门到驾驶室，给了我和老婆五盒方便面，说现在武汉没啥别的东西好招待的，让我们拿点方便面垫一下肚子。
Before we left, the fire brigade, specialized in the cab, gave my wife and I five boxes of instant noodles, said that Wuhan now there is nothing else to serve, let us get some instant noodles cushion belly.
想想现在武汉物资都这么缺乏了，他们还给我东西。
Now that Wuhan is so short of supplies, they give me something back.
上高速时，交警再次查身份证，量体温，确认没问题才准离开。
On the high speed, traffic police check the identity card again, take temperature, make sure there is no problem before leaving.
离开武汉，我们走到蕲春服务区，前一天连夜去湖州，那天晚上实在太累了，在服务区停车睡了一晚上，第二天再开车回的无锡。
The day before, we are all so tired that we have stopped in the service area all night and drive back to Wuxi the next day.
我听说这次捐赠不止我一辆车去武汉，但因为都在平台上接单，各地的司机都有，我们也互相联系不上。
I heard that I donated more than one car to Wuhan, but as they are all on the platform, drivers everywhere have, we are not connected to each other.
我认识一个山东临沂的师傅，就是从江苏盐城拉消毒水去武汉的。
I know a master of Linyi in Shandong who went to Wuhan with disinfectant water from Yancheng, Jiangsu Province.
隔离14天，看不到孩子也会想回来下高速，就开始量体温做检查。
Isolated for 14 days, seeing that the child would want to come back down the freeway, he began to take a temperature check.
政府说因为从疫区来，所以要就地隔离。
The government said it wanted to isolate the area because it came from an infected area.
我们得在指定的酒店隔离14天，到2月11号。
We'll have to stay in a designated hotel for 14 days, until Feb. 11.
初五，也就是正式隔离的第二天，我爸给送来了生活用品和换洗衣物。
On the fifth day of school, the day after the official isolation, my father brought supplies and change of clothes.
虽然就在家旁边，但我们和家人也没法见面。
Even though we were at home, we couldn't see each other.
东西送到大堂，再由医护人员转交。
Things are delivered to the lobby and then delivered by paramedics.
其实接单和送货的时候，我们都不知道要被隔离的事儿，回来才知道。
In fact, when the order and delivery, we do not know to be isolated, back to know.
从湖北回来的都要隔离，我跟满帮反映了这个情况。
Those who come back from Hubei are quarantined, and I and Manchu reflect this situation.
满帮安慰我们说：“这个你们放心，回来安顿好，这次隔离的误工损失，运满满会补贴。
Full help to comfort us: "You rest assured, come back to settle down, this isolation of the loss of work, full of subsidies.
”其实这个时候了，只要差不多就成了，也没有谁会斤斤计较。
"In fact, this time, as long as it is almost, no one will be a haggle.
他们说，一定会对司机师傅负责的。
They said they would be responsible to the driver.
现在我们吃饭，早中晚餐都是工作人员准时准点送上门，放在门口，我们自己拿屋。
Now we eat, breakfast and dinner are on time to send the door, put on the door, we take the house ourselves.
我们也问过要怎么付钱，工作人员说现在非常时期，政府也没有明确说，东西先吃着，不用担心钱的事。
We also asked how money would be paid, and officials said it was not clear from the government that it would be better to eat first and not worry about the money.
满帮说后续如果有另外的支出，他们会据实报销。
The group said it would reimburse it if it had additional expenses.
我在酒店登记的时候，前面已经有一些人在隔离了，估计我们镇上得有几十个人。
When I checked in at the hotel, there were already a few people in quarantine ahead of me, and it was estimated that there would be dozens of people in our town.
隔离点还挺多的，我们镇，隔壁镇，都有指定的隔离点。
There's a lot of quarantine. We've got a designated isolation point in our town, next door.
隔离也没意思，出不去，就只能刷刷抖音。
Isolation is no fun. If you can't get out, you just brush your jitter.
有时我会跟孩子视频，闲的时候就打一个电话，看不到孩子也会想。
Sometimes I would video with the child, when free to make a phone call, not see the children will think.
她在家挺好的，跟我爸妈相处也很好。
She's fine at home, and she's great with my parents.
现在一岁多，已经会小跑，还在学说话，有时候会叫“爸爸妈妈”，有时候就不高兴叫。
Now more than a year old, has been able to trot, is still learning to speak, sometimes called "Mom and Dad", sometimes unhappy yelling.
我老婆回来后还有点咳嗽，还发热，我有点担心。
My wife came back with a cough and a fever, and I was a little worried.
去了趟医院做了检查，没什么事儿，应该是着凉了。
I went to the hospital for a check-up. It was nothing. It must have caught a cold.
我知道武汉是疫区，但我没什么后悔的我是1996年生人，2012年出来工作，到现在已经有8年了。
I know Wuhan is an epidemic area, but I have no regrets I am a stranger in 1996, 2012 out to work, it has been 8 years.
老婆小我两岁，结婚之后我们有了女儿，现在一岁多了。
Wife is two years younger than me. We had a daughter after we got married and are now over a year old.
刚开始工作时，我在厂里做些杂工，后来学了两年厨师。
When I first started work, I did some handyman in the factory, and then I learned to cook for two years.
当时年纪轻，也没怎么好好学。
I was too young to study hard.
我爸也是卡车司机，之前跑长途，从无锡运货去广东，一个人跑车太辛苦，就让我回来帮帮忙，在路上好有个照应，我也就回来了，开始学着跑车。
My father is also a truck driver, before long-distance transport from Wuxi to Guangdong, a person's sports car too hard, let me come back to help, on the way to a good care, I also came back, began to learn sports car.
后来我买了车，开始自己跑。
Then I bought a car and started running on my own.
我爸现在还在跑车，但也不跑长途了，主要跑短途。
My dad is still in the sports car now, but he doesn't run long distances either. He runs short distances.
我有一辆6米8的江淮中型货车，通常在江苏南部、浙江北部和上海这一块跑车。
I have a 6 '8 Jianghuai Medium Goods Vehicle, usually in the southern part of Jiangsu, northern Zhejiang and Shanghai.
平时接活也不太挑，只要车能装，我都接。
Usually not too pick up the work, as long as the car can be loaded, I pick up.
这辆车买了有一年多，当时一共花了二十万出头，有十万的首付，十万的贷款，加上利息每个月还5000多，差不多两年能把钱都还清。
It had cost more than two hundred thousand dollars, a hundred thousand down payments, a hundred thousand dollars in loans, plus interest payments of more than five thousand a month, and almost two years to pay off all the money.
2020年1月27日，农历大年初三，浙江湖州。
January 27, 2020, Lunar New Year, the third day of the Zhejiang Huzhou.
趁着工人们忙着给车上装消毒水，顾师傅抽空给自己和刚买一年多的货车，拍了个合影自拍。
While the workers were busy loading the car with disinfectant, Master Gu took time to take a group photo of himself and the truck that he had just bought for over a year.
摄影/顾师傅现在每个月挣的钱，除去车子的贷款，基本还能负担家里的开销。
Master Photographer / Master Shifu now earns more or less enough money per month to cover the expenses of the family, excluding the car loan.
如果临时有些意外的开销，也在朋友那里周转一下。
If there are unforeseen expenses in the interim, turn them around with friends.
总体上跟我一开始预计的差不多。
Overall, it's about what I expected at the beginning.
说实话，接这个单，价格也挺吸引人，因为是春节，加上又有疫情，还只能放空回来，他们出价比平时高不少，刨去烧油和过路费，还能挣一些。
To tell you the truth, the price is very attractive, because the Spring Festival, coupled with the outbreak of the disease, can only be released back, they bid a lot higher than usual, gouging oil and road tolls, and can earn some money.
毕竟要养车养家。
After all, keep a car.
这次跑一趟武汉，基本没有坑，跟我理解的状况大体差不多，就出了一下高速口，其他也没什么大的问题。
This trip to Wuhan, basic no pit, and I understand the situation is about the same, out of the high-speed mouth, and other no major problems.
我知道武汉是疫区，回来还隔离了，但我没什么后悔的。
I know Wuhan is an epidemic area, come back to quarantine, but I have nothing to regret.
