澎湃新闻记者 南博一 实习生 曲思翰过去两天，超过2万名哈佛大学学生本该迎接周末开启的春假的平静生活，但是这一切因为一封邮件而被打破。
More than 20, 000 Harvard students were supposed to prepare for a quiet weekend spring break over the past two days, but that was shattered by an e-mail.
当地时间3月10日上午，哈佛大学总教务长库拉那（Rakesh Khurana）在一封邮件中要求所有哈佛学生在3月15日下午5点前搬离学校宿舍。
On the morning of March 10, Harvard University's general provost, Rakesh Khurana, sent an e-mail asking all Harvard students to move out of their dorms by 5 p.m. March 15.
这封邮件，被23岁的本科生乔丹·巴顿称为“驱逐信”。
The email was referred to as an "expulsion letter" by 23-year-old Jordan Barton, an undergraduate.
哈佛“封校”“我原以为最坏的情况就是上更多网课。
"I thought the worst would be to take more classes online.
”美国哈佛大学大三女生依弦告诉澎湃新闻（www.thepaper.cn）。
A junior at Harvard University told the roar news (www.thepper.cn).
但现在，她不得不迅速搬离学校宿舍，回到位于美国南部的家中。
But now she has to move quickly out of school dormitories and back to her home in the southern United States.
3月4日，据由哈佛大学学生运营的《哈佛深红报》报道，哈佛本科学院教务长克劳丁·盖伊（Claudine Gay）在每月的教职工会议上，要求教师为将来用视频软件教学的可能性做好准备。
Claudine Gay, dean of Harvard Undergraduate School, told a monthly faculty meeting on Monday to prepare teachers for the possibility of using video software to teach in the future, Harvard's Deep Red reported.
仅仅一周之后，情况就发生了巨大变化。
Just a week later, the situation has changed dramatically.
美国东部时间3月10日早上8:29，哈佛大学的学生收到了校长劳伦斯·巴考（Lawrence Bacow）发来的邮件。
At 8: 29 a.m. EDT, Harvard students received an email from Lawrence Bacow, the president of Harvard University.
邮件中，巴考告诉学生们，“为限制社区成员接触到这种（新冠肺炎）疾病”，哈佛大学已经开始“向研究生和本科生的在线教学过渡（transitioning to virtual education）”。
In the e-mail, Bacau told students that "in order to limit community members" access to the disease, Harvard has begun a "transition to virtual education for graduate and undergraduate students."
学校的目标是，到3月23日，也就是哈佛学生春假结束后本将返校上课的第一天完成这一转型。
The school aims to complete the transition by March 23, the first day of school that Harvard students would have returned to school after their spring break.
与此同时，哈佛大学要求利用春假时间回家或出行的同学不得在假期结束后返校。
Meanwhile, Harvard students who take advantage of spring break time to return home or travel are not allowed to return to school after the holidays.
需要留在学校的学生，也将接受远程教育并“为受到严格限制的校园活动和互动做好准备”。
Pupils who need to stay in school will also receive distance education and "prepare for severely restricted school activities and interactions."
巴考建议不要举行超过25人参加的非必要活动。
Baucau advised against non-essential activities involving more than 25 participants.
然而，短短19分钟后的8:48，哈佛大学总教务长库拉那发出了上述要求所有哈佛学生离校的邮件。
Yet just 19 minutes later, at 8: 48, Harvard University's Dean of Staff, Condoleezza Khurana, sent the message asking all Harvard students to leave school.
“我看到第一封邮件时，想的是自己将会被隔离在宿舍里上网课。
"When I saw my first e-mail, I thought I was going to be isolated in my dorm room with Internet classes.
”原计划在春假期间回家的依弦，打算“就不回家了”。
The couple, who had planned to return home during the spring break, decided not to go home.
然而短短十多分钟后，她的计划被第二封邮件再次打破。
After just over a decade, however, her plan was broken again by a second email.
国际学生和贫困生遇到挑战和许多留美中国学生一样，来自中国南方的麦克在美国高校的寒假期间回了国。
Like many Chinese students in the United States, Mike, from southern China, returned home during his winter vacation at an American university.
当他在1月底回到哈佛校园时，学校“没人管”，过了数天才以邮件形式建议刚从中国抵达的学生在日常学习生活中与他人“保持社交距离（social distancing）”。
When he returned to Harvard at the end of January, the school was "neglected," and it took days to e-mail students who had just arrived from China to "socialize" with others in their daily learning lives.
麦克觉得，他身边的美国同学生活照旧，只把新冠肺炎当成普通的流感来对待，况且，即使研究表明所有人群普遍易感，但“二十多岁的年轻人无所谓，他们的家人相对来说还更在意一些。
Mike thinks his American classmates live as usual, treating pneumonia only as a common flu, and that, even if the study shows that all groups are susceptible, "young people in their twenties are indifferent and their families are relatively more concerned."
”2月1日，哈佛大学所在的马萨诸塞州确诊了第一例新冠肺炎病例，但在此后的一个月内，并没有新增病例。
The state of Massachusetts, where Harvard is based, confirmed the first case of New Crown Pneumonia on February 1, but there were no new cases within a month.
不过，3月6日，总部位于马萨诸塞州剑桥市的渤健生物科技公司（Biogen）有三名员工新冠病毒检测呈阳性。
However, on March 6, three employees of Bojian Biogen, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, tested positive for the virus.
据《波士顿环球报》报道，该公司曾于2月26日举行了有来自世界各地175名高管参加的峰会。
The Boston Globe reported that the company held a summit of 175 executives from around the world on February 26.
3月4日，渤健公司告诉该州公共卫生部门，有两名来自欧洲的参会者在返回后被检测出新冠病毒阳性。
On March 4, Bojian told the state's public health department that two participants from Europe had been tested positive for the new crown virus on their return.
而在3月6日马萨诸塞州新冠检测呈阳性的92人中，70人是渤健公司的员工或其密切接触者。
Of the 92 people who tested positive for the Massachusetts crown on March 6, 70 were Bojian employees or their close contacts.
渤健生物科技公司的所在地剑桥市，也正是哈佛大学和麻省理工学院所在地。
The home of Bojian Biotech, Cambridge, is home to Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
对于随疫情而来的“封校”举措，麦克觉得“可以理解”。
Mike felt "understandable" about the "school closure" that came with the outbreak.
他以同为常青藤大学的哥伦比亚大学举例称，“如果仅仅停课的话，对保护学生和教职工来说没用。
He cited Columbia University, also known as Ivy League University, as an example. "It doesn't help to protect students and faculty if you just stop classes.
就像哥大，在前几天宣布停课后，学生在校园里还是会一起吃饭、聚会，病毒一样会传播。
Like a cell phone, after a few days' suspension, a student still eats or gets together on campus, spreading like a virus.
对哈佛来说，（等）校园里有了确诊病例（再封校）就晚了。
For Harvard, it is too late to have a confirmed case on campus.
如果将全部学生都（在校内）隔离，学校在资源上也支撑不了。
If all the students are segregated (in schools), the schools will not be able to sustain themselves in terms of resources.
”只是，麦克觉得，“学校对国际学生有点太狠了。
"Just, Mike thought," the school is a little too tough for international students.
”虽然哈佛大学允许来自目前被美国疾控中心列为第三级警告国家的留学生在当地时间3月11日早上9点前，也就是教务长库拉那发出邮件的24小时内递交留校申请，“但不保证能批准”。
Although Harvard allowed students from countries now listed as Level 3 by the CDC to apply to stay at school by 9am local time, within 24 hours of the dean's e-mail message, "there is no guarantee it will be approved."
“学校同样表示会给家庭困难的学生补贴旅费，但一样是需要审批的。
"The school also said it would subsidize the travel expenses of needy students, but the same would apply.
”麦克补充说。
"he added.
“我们知道，对你们中的一些人来说，在短时间内离开校园将是一个挑战。
"We know it will be a challenge for some of you to leave campus in a short time.
”库拉那在给学生的邮件中写道。
"Kulana wrote in an e-mail to the students.
遇到挑战的，不仅仅是国际学生。
It is not just international students who are challenged.
短短三天的时间里，依弦不得不想办法把房间里自己的东西清空，至于她在宿舍里养的植物，她也不知道该如何处理。
In just three days, Yingcheng had to find a way to empty the room of her own things, and she did not know what to do with the plants she kept in the dorm.
更糟糕的是，据《哈佛深红报》报道，很多来自美国低收入家庭的哈佛学生依赖学校获得“食物、住房和稳定”。
Worse, Harvard Deep Red reports that many Harvard students from low-income families in the United States rely on schools for "food, shelter, and stability."
对来自低收入家庭的第一代大学生来说，这则“最短的通知”给他们的生活造成了很大的困扰。
For the first generation of college students from low-income families, the "shortest notice" has been a major disruption to their lives.
大一新生埃里克·奥维拉（Eric Olvera）对该报表示，他在回家的机票上花了700美元，“这相当于我一半的身家”。
Eric Olvera, a freshman, told the paper that he had spent $700 on his ticket home, "which is half my fortune."
在接到通知后，麦克马上就买了回国的机票。
At short notice, Mike bought a ticket home.
他在朋友圈中写道：“一觉醒来变成网校了，希望疫情尽快好转。
"He wrote in a circle of friends:" Wake up to become a net school, hope that the epidemic situation as soon as possible.
”一些毕业年班的学生带着香槟来到校园里，提前拍下了“毕业照”，以防无法在毕业前的春天回到校园。
Some graduate-year-olds arrive on campus with champagne and snap their "graduation photos" in advance, in case they don't get back on campus in the spring before graduation.
美东时间3月11日13:43，哈佛大学的学生们又收到了一封新邮件，该校校医服务（Harvard Health Services）在邮件中称，目前正有两名哈佛学生接受新冠病毒检测。
Harvard students have received a new email from Harvard Health Services saying two Harvard students are being tested for the virus.
