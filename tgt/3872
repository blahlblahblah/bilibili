王鹏一度担心找不到父亲王启阳了。
Wang Peng once worried that he could not find his father Wang Qiyang.

.
从2020年2月17日22:13，医生告诉他父亲心跳停止；到3月11日，武汉市蔡甸区玉笋山殡仪馆来电与他确认信息，悲愤与忧惧像一块巨石，在他心口上碾压了23天。
From 22: 13 on February 17, 2020, the doctor told his father that his heart had stopped. On March 11, a phone call from the Yuduoshan Funeral Home in Cai Den, Wuhan City, confirmed the message with him.

.
此前，他不知道因新冠肺炎去世的父亲被送去了哪个殡仪馆，是否已火化，也不知道何时能领回骨灰安葬。
He did not know which funeral home his father had died of pneumonia, whether he had been cremated, and when he would be able to recover his ashes for burial.
一通短暂的电话，让石头落了地，心碎成好几块儿，一切又恢复了沉寂。
A brief telephone call, let the stone fall to the ground, heartbroken into pieces, everything was quiet again.
。
.
在武汉，不知多少逝者的骨灰仍被寄存在殡仪馆，等待亲人领取后安葬。
In Wuhan, the remains of an unknown number of the dead are still deposited in the funeral parlour, waiting for relatives to receive after burial.
。
.
3月，疫情逐渐稳定，殡仪馆的来电陆续打到了更多逝者家属的手机上，核实逝者姓名身份及联系人信息，告知疫情结束后，将安排家属在特定的时间段分批领回骨灰，但具体时间要等待后续通知。
In March, the epidemic stabilized and calls from the funeral home reached more and more of the deceased's family members' mobile phones, verifying the deceased's name and contact information and informing them that, once the outbreak was over, the family would be arranged to collect the ashes in batches at a specific time, subject to subsequent notification.

近期与逝者家属联系的，有医院、社区工作者、民警以及殡葬服务业者。
Recent contacts with the families of the deceased have included hospitals, community workers, civilian police and funeral services.
后者向家属提供殡葬咨询服务，隐约提醒墓地可能涨价，骨灰盒需要预备，建议先交定金。

根据国家卫健委、民政部和公安部三部门2月1日印发的《新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎患者遗体处置工作指引（试行）》（简称《指引》），不得举行遗体告别仪式。
According to the Guidelines on the Handling of Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia (Trial) issued on February 1 by the three departments of the State Health Commission, the Ministry of Civil Affairs and the Ministry of Public Security, no memorial service may be held.

已有志愿者提供“云祭祀”等心理援助。
Volunteers have provided psychological assistance such as "Cloud Sacrifice."
“一个人在家里哭一场，跟在朋友面前哭一场，感觉还是不一样的。
"It's still different to cry at home and cry in front of your friends.
”疫情期间为多个逝者家庭提供心理援助的社区志愿者雷五明说。
"Lei Five-ming, a community volunteer who provided psychological assistance to several families of the deceased during the outbreak, said.
他是武汉理工大学心理健康与生涯规划教育研究所所长。
He is director of Wuhan Polytechnic University's Institute of Mental Health and Career Planning.
。
.
雷五明建议，在封城全面解除后，最好能允许家属为逝者操持告别仪式，“给家属一个表达悲痛的方式，也接受其他人传递来的能量”。
After the closure is lifted, Mr Lemming suggests, it would be better for families to be allowed to take leave of the dead, "to give their families a way to express their grief, and to accept the energy that others have passed on."
。
.
“云选墓”。
"Cloud Tomb Selection".
感染新冠病毒的父亲走了之后，王鹏一直没获得后续信息，不知哪个环节没衔接上。
After the father infected with the new crown virus left, Wang Peng has not received follow-up information, I do not know which link did not connect.
。
.
“据我了解，各家医院的逝者送往哪个殡仪馆，有明确规定。
"As far as I know, there are clear rules as to which funeral homes the deceased of each hospital should be sent.
家属不知道亲人去向，应该是个例。
It should be the case that families do not know where their loved ones are.
可能医院没说清殡仪馆名称，或派出所没来得及通知家属，电话没打通等。
Perhaps the hospital did not say the name of the funeral home, or the police station did not notify the family, the telephone did not open.
”雷五明说。
'he said.
。
.
也有家属跟此前的王鹏一样，不知道亲人的骨灰在哪里，因为自己也还在隔离。
There are family members and the previous Wang Peng, do not know where the ashes of their loved ones, because they are still in isolation.
。
.
3月3日，有自称医院医务处负责善后工作的人来电，询问王鹏想把父亲安葬在何处。
On March 3, a person claiming to be in charge of the medical service of the hospital called and asked Wang Peng where he wanted to bury his father.
。
.
“我们会征询家属意见，统一登记上报，如果后续有关于墓地或殡葬相关的优惠政策，及时通知家属。
"We will seek the views of our families and register them uniformly. If there are any preferential policies regarding cemeteries or burials, we will inform the families in time.
”南方周末记者以逝者亲友身份咨询时，这位工作人员解释，之前工作确实太忙了，可能有些通知不够及时，希望家属理解，现在一一联系家属，就是让大家安心。
When Southern Weekend reporter asked about relatives and friends of the deceased, the official explained that he had been too busy, perhaps some of the notices were not timely enough, and hoped family members would understand that contacting them now would be reassuring.
等解封后，再通知家属来领死亡通知单，凭此单领取骨灰。
After unsealing, then notify the family to collect the death notice, on the basis of this form to collect the ashes.
。
.
3月4日，一位叫“燕子”的女士与王鹏联系。
March 4, a woman called "swallow" and Wang Peng contact.
她自称提供“疫情生命关怀服务”，来自由殡葬协会会员单位自发组建的平台，免费提供治丧流程指导、墓地咨询等服务。
She claims to provide "epidemic life care services," free funeral association member self-organized platform, free of charge to provide mourning process guidance, cemetery counselling and other services.
。
.
“陵园没有预备那么多墓，现在还要赶工新建，很多陵园库存不足了。
"There are not so many tombs in the mausoleum. Now we have to build new ones.
”燕子在为王鹏提供墓地咨询服务时说，“很多人现在在网上预订，经过我们介绍的也有很多。
"Many people book online now, and there are a lot of things we have introduced," said the swallow, who provided consultancy services for Wang Peng.
十万以上的很少，都在定三至五万的，这种低价位的墓，更好卖一点，会紧俏。
More than 100,000 are very few, are fixed at between three and fifty thousand, this low-priced tombs, better selling a little, will be tight.
”。
"
燕子提供的转定金二维码为“武汉孝行天下的店铺”，工商资料和公司官网均显示，这是一家殡葬礼仪服务公司。
Swallows to provide the two-dimensional code for "Wuhan filial piety world shop," industrial and commercial data and the company's official website show that this is a funeral service company.
早在2月1日，中国殡葬协会青年与社会工作委员会联合武汉孝行天下礼仪服务有限公司等殡葬服务公司曾发出求助信，请求支援口罩、酒精、运尸袋等防护物资。
As early as February 1, the Youth and Social Work Committee of the China Funeral Association and other funeral services companies such as Wuhan Xiaohang World Etiquette Services Co. Ltd. issued letters of request for support for respirators, alcohol, body bags and other protective materials.
南方周末记者多次联系求助信中的两位联系人，均未获回应。
Southern Weekend reporter repeatedly contacted two contacts in the letter of request for help, but no response.

.
墓地要涨价的风声已经传开了，一位自称在武汉市殡葬行业做了两年的人士告诉南方周末记者。
Rumors of a graveyard price hike have spread, a self-declared funeral industry in Wuhan City for two years told Southern Weekend reporter.
“房子估计会降价，但墓地反而会涨。
"Houses are expected to go down, but cemeteries are going up.
比如说九峰山48800的墓地，已经涨成58800了。
For example, Jiufeng Mountain 48800 cemetery, has grown to 58800.
”。
"
九峰山革命烈士陵园被称为“武汉八宝山”。
The Jiufeng Mountain Revolutionary Martyrs' Garden is called "Wuhan Baoshan."
据武汉市九峰纪念花园管理有限公司官网介绍，九峰山由象鼻峰等九座山峰组成，是“明末清初达官贵人首选的风水宝地”。
According to Wuhan Jiufeng Memorial Garden Management Co. Ltd., Jiufeng Mountain is composed of nine peaks, such as trunk peak, is the "Ming and early Qing Dynasty officials the first choice of geomantic treasure.
。
.
上述人士向南方周末记者介绍，交一两千元定金选了号，就不会再涨价，一般家庭买的墓地均价在三万块钱左右，三万元以上的墓，他可以提供约两千块的优惠。
The above-mentioned person told Southern Weekend reporter, paid a 1000 yuan deposit selected number, will no longer increase the price, the average family bought the cemetery around 30,000 yuan, more than 30,000 yuan cemetery, he can provide about 2,000 yuan discount.
疫情期间，不能现场看墓地，感兴趣的话，可以把图片和价格发来“云选墓”。
During the outbreak, can not see the cemetery site, if interested, you can send pictures and prices to the "Cloud tomb."
。
.
关于墓地涨价的说法，尚无法证明是“推销话术”还是中肯建议。
The claim that the cemetery price is rising is not yet proven to be "marketing" or to the point.
但对于如何妥善安置逝者，相关部门已在研讨中。
However, how to properly settle the deceased, the relevant departments have been under discussion.

3月11日，湖北仙鹤湖湿地公园推出1000座一平米标准公益墓，捐赠给因感染新冠病毒去世的武汉市民。
On March 11, the Xianghe Lake Wetland Park in Hubei Province launched 1,000 one-square-metre standard public service tombs, donated to Wuhan city residents who died of the virus.
3月14日晚，公墓一位负责登记需求信息的工作人员向南方周末记者表示，他们已将方案上报给政府有关部门，能否落实、如何落实，将等待进一步安排。
On the night of March 14, a cemetery official with information on registration needs told Southern Weekend that they had reported the plan to the relevant government departments and that its implementation and implementation would await further arrangements.

燕子告诉王鹏，这个免费公墓太远了，坐大巴车过去要4个小时，她推荐了九峰山附近几个新建的墓地。
Swallow told Wang Peng, this free cemetery is too far, bus ride past the past four hours, she recommended a few Jiufeng Shan near the new cemetery.
。

除了墓地，燕子还提供了“抗疫爱心特价寿盒”清单，20种产品，价格从398-5880元不等，包括川玉、汉白玉、梨木、黑檀木等各类材质。
In addition to the cemetery, the swallow has also provided a list of 20 products, ranging in price from 398-5880 yuan, including Sichuan jade, white jade, pear, ebony and other materials.

无法见面的永别。
Farewell to those who cannot see.
把父亲抬上救护车，是王鹏与父亲的最后一次拥抱。
Taking his father into the ambulance was Wang Peng's last hug with his father.
。
.
父亲呼吸衰竭、咳嗽不止、全身发紫，裹在一条粉白绿色条纹相间的棉被里。
His father was in a white-and-green striped quilt of respiratory failure, cough, and purple all over his body.
王鹏穿着社区送的一层透明薄塑料防护服，托着父亲的头和上半身。

隔着黑色的泳镜，父子俩互相看了一眼，没想到这一眼竟是诀别。

2月9日，父亲住院吸上氧后，情况有些好转，但很快又急剧恶化，ICU病床也满了，住不进。
On 9 February, after his father had been hospitalized with oxygen, the situation improved somewhat, but quickly deteriorated again, and ICU beds were full and inaccessible.
这一日，武汉确诊、重症数据，还未攀升到顶点。
On this day, Wuhan diagnosis, severe data, has not climbed to the peak.
火神山医院刚投入使用一周，雷神山医院ICU病房还未投入使用。
The fire god mountain hospital just put into use a week, Lei Shenshan hospital ICU ward has not been put into use.

2月15日，医生告诉王鹏，父亲病情危重，但有创呼吸机不够用、人工肺ECMO更要排队。
Feb. 15, doctors told Wang Peng, his father is critically ill, but there is not enough invasive breathing machine, artificial lung ECMO queue.
17号晚上，噩耗传来：医生告诉他，父亲心跳刚刚停止，按规定还要再抢救半小时，可能没太大希望了。
On the 17th, the news came: the doctor had told him that his father's heart had barely stopped and that he needed to save another half hour.
。
.
“我能说什么呢？就说谢谢医生。
"What can I say? Just say thanks to the doctor.
”他顿了半晌，声音沙哑，“最后空出一台有创呼吸机给他插管，但父亲当时已经太虚弱了，没坚持住。
"He paused for a while, his voice husky," and finally let out a invasive ventilator to intubate him, but my father was too weak to hold on.

按照卫健委等发布的《指引》，医疗机构要完成遗体卫生防疫处理，密封后严禁打开。
According to the Guidelines issued by the Health Care Commission and others, medical institutions should complete the sanitary and epidemic prevention treatment of human remains and strictly prohibit their opening after sealing.
。
.
《指引》规定了遗体处置流程，各医院对之进行了细化。
The Guidelines set out the procedures for the disposal of mortal remains, which have been refined by hospitals.
南方周末记者在武汉市蔡甸区某医院看到的一份流程显示：患者死亡后30分钟内，医务人员电话通知家属到院办理手续，领取死亡证明。
Southern Weekend reporter saw a hospital in Cai Den district of Wuhan City, a process showed that within 30 minutes after the death of the patient, medical staff called their families to check in and collect death certificates.
医务人员与家属在四份遗体接收登记表签字，一张交殡仪馆工作人员，一张交家属，其余留在病区。
Medical staff and family members signed registration forms for the receipt of four human remains, one for mortuary workers, one for family members and the rest for the sick area.
。
.
前述与王鹏联系的医院医务处工作人员说，包括逝者的贵重遗物，也有保存。
The aforementioned hospital medical service staff who contacted Wang Peng said, including the dead valuable relics, but also preserved.
。
.
疫情早期，家属还可以去医院告别。
Early in the epidemic, families can also go to the hospital to say goodbye.
“隔着玻璃看一眼，表示这是我们家的人。
"A look through the glass shows that it's from my family.
”雷五明接触过一位五十多岁的女性，丈夫初一发病，初四就去世了。
"Lei Wuming came into contact with a woman in her fifties and died on the fourth day of her husband's first illness.
但家里人都告诉她不要去医院，担心被传染。
But the family told her not to go to the hospital for fear of infection.
等到她自己隔离期结束，又哭诉自己冷酷无情，丈夫对她很好，连最后一面都没见。
When her own isolation was over and she wept and told herself how unfeeling she was, her husband was so good to her that he never saw her for the last time.
。
.
到后来，私家车限行，小区封闭管理，加上密切接触者要求隔离，几乎没有家属可以到场，只能由警察和医护人员代签。
Later, private cars were restricted, the neighbourhood was closed, and close contacts demanded isolation, leaving few family members to be present and only signed by the police and medical personnel.
。
.
而即便亲属在场，因为这是传染病，也不能跟殡仪车送行。
And even if the relatives were present, because it was an infectious disease, they could not see the undertaker off.
特殊时期，非新冠病毒感染的逝者家属，也未能到殡仪馆相送。
Special period, non-new crown virus infection of the deceased's family, also failed to send to the funeral parlour.
。
.
从定点接收变成就近处理。
From fixed-point reception to proximity processing.
疫情期间，殡葬行业也一度面临防护物资缺乏的难题。
During the epidemic, the funeral industry also faced a shortage of protective materials.
。
.
约从1月20日开始，仅有汉口殡仪馆定点接收新冠病毒感染患者遗体。
Starting around January 20, only the Hankou mortuary has been designated to receive the remains of patients infected with the new crown virus.
。
.
1月26日起，武汉疫情患者（包括疑似）遗体免收火化费。
Since January 26, Wuhan epidemic patients (including suspected) remains are exempt from cremation fees.
武汉民政局还提到，为加强运力，已争取市指挥部、省民政厅支援，调配了一批殡仪车辆、人员以及防护装具，充实到殡仪馆，提高了遗体接运和服务保障能力。
Wuhan Civil Affairs Bureau also mentioned that in order to strengthen transportation capacity, the city command, provincial civil affairs departments have been supported, deployed a number of funeral vehicles, personnel and protective equipment to the funeral parlour, and enhanced the capacity of the body transportation and service support.
。
.
遗体运至殡仪馆也从定点接收变成就近处理。
The transport of the body to the funeral home also changed from fixed-point reception to nearby disposal.
2月1日，《指引》发布，要求新冠肺炎患者遗体应当就近全部火化，不得采用埋葬或其它保存遗体方式，不得移运。
On February 1, the Guidelines issued the requirement that the remains of patients with pneumonia should be cremated at a nearby location, and no burial or other means of preserving the body should be used.
。
.
这一日，多家殡葬机构发出了求助信，请求支援防护服、酒精、护目镜、运尸袋等物资。
On that day, a number of funeral homes issued letters of request for support for protective clothing, alcohol, goggles, body bags and other materials.
。
.
多家外地殡仪馆曾派出了殡葬服务队支援湖北。
Many foreign funeral homes have sent funeral service teams to support Hubei.
2月20日，湖北副省长万勇到武昌殡仪馆视察，提出做到“身份不错、手续完备、流程规范、数据真实”，也感谢兄弟省市来鄂援助人员。
February 20, Hubei vice-governor Wan Yong to Wuchang funeral parlour inspection, put forward to do "good identity, procedures, procedures, data truthfulness," but also thanks brother provinces and cities to Hubei aid workers.
。
.
目前武汉疫情缓解，这些外援也停下工作，处于隔离观察中。
At present, Wuhan disease relief, these foreign aid also stopped work, in isolation under observation.
“上班时候我天天心里默念，我要活着回去。
"I tell myself daily at work, I want to go back alive.
”一位外援的殡葬人员婉拒了南方周末记者采访。
An undertaker of foreign aid declined to be interviewed by Southern Weekend reporters.
。
.
“每个亲友追悼群都像一个支撑伤痛的房子”。
"Every family mourns is like a house that sustains pain."
没能送亲人最后一程，成为王鹏一家人的遗憾。
Failed to send their loved ones the last ride, Wang Peng family regret.
所幸他和母亲均未被感染。
Fortunately, neither he nor his mother was infected.
。
.
2月19日，父亲去世的第三天，王鹏给父亲的主治医生打过一次电话，医生仍不知道父亲被送去了什么地方，是否已火化，表示会帮忙联系太平间询问，也没回音。
On February 19, the third day of his father's death, Wang Peng made a telephone call to his father's attending doctor, the doctor still did not know where his father was sent, whether it had been cremated, said he would help to contact the morgue, but did not reply.
。
.
对此，前述医院医务处的人员解释，医院当时大部分是外援医生，对医院安置逝者的流程不太清楚。
In this regard, the staff of the aforementioned hospital medical service explained that the hospital at that time was mostly foreign aid doctors, the process of the hospital placement of deceased persons is not clear.
。
.
王鹏已经足够机警理智，在疫情宣告“人传人”之前，就抢购了最好的医用口罩，花100元买了一件防护服，备有84消毒液……几乎用上了一个普通市民能获得的所有相对“靠谱”的武器来对抗病毒，却仍很难鼓起勇气，踏入父亲曾住过的房间。
Wang Peng was shrewd enough to snap up the best medical mask before the outbreak was declared "human-to-human." He spent 100 yuan on a protective suit with 84 disinfectant... using almost all the relative "spectrum" weapons available to an ordinary citizen to fight the virus.
。
.
直到后来母亲解除隔离回家，母子俩为了分开房间隔离，才打开了父亲的房门，把床单都扔了，床板用消毒液喷洒后，放在更方便去洗手间的客厅，给母亲睡。
It was not until her mother came home from isolation that the mother and son opened her father's door to separate the rooms and threw the sheets away. The bed boards were sprayed with disinfectant and placed in the living room, where it was more convenient for the mother to sleep.
。
.
对一些逝者家庭来说，家庭成员陆续发病，仍在治疗或隔离观察中，尚无精力，也并不知道该如何面对逝者的身后事。
For some families of the deceased, family members continue to suffer from illness, are still under treatment or isolated observation, have no energy and do not know what to do with the dead.
。
.
“有个女孩说，爷爷因新冠肺炎去世了，轻症的妈妈跟奶奶在一处，最先得病的父亲还在另一个地方隔离。
"One girl said Grandpa had died of pneumonia, that his light-hearted mother was with her grandma, and that the first sick father was still in another place.
她问我，如果哪一天，可以领回爷爷的骨灰了，该怎么告诉奶奶这个消息？”雷五明也感到忧心。
She asked me, if one day, can get back the ashes of Grandpa, how to tell Grandma this news? "Lei Wuming is also worried.
。
.
这是每个逝者家庭都要面对的“关口”。
This is the "threshold" that every family of the deceased must face.
所有人都渐渐意识到，狡猾的冠状病毒实在残酷。
Everyone has come to realize that the cunning coronavirus is really cruel.
隔离防护没做好，一家人感染；隔离防护做得好，又得在骨肉相连的地方切割。
The isolation is not good, the family is infected; the quarantine is well done, and the cutting has to be done where the bones are connected.
越是理智的爱与保护欲，越得在亲人之间隔出一道防线。
The more rational love and desire to protect, the more in the family separated by a line of defense.
。

2020年3月9日晚，武汉市洪山体育馆武昌方舱医院休舱前夜，新冠肺炎患者与上海复旦大学附属华山医院医护人员拥抱道别。
On the evening of March 9, 2020, the night before the opening of Wuchang Fang Hospital in Hongshan Stadium, Wuhan City, the patient bid farewell to the medical staff of Huashan Hospital attached to Fudan University in Shanghai.

(Xinhua news agency / picture).
因为怕感染儿子，父亲发烧后，曾在母亲的陪伴下，步行2公里去医院。
Afraid of infecting his son, his father had a fever, accompanied by his mother, walked 2 km to the hospital.
王鹏开车在旁边缓缓跟着，走了2个多小时。
Wang Peng slowly followed in the side of the car, walking for more than two hours.
每次看到父母佝偻着身子，坐在路边的石墩子上喘息，他都忍不住喊他们上车。
Every time saw the parents hunched body, sitting on the roadside stone pier on the gasp, he could not help but call them into the car.
父母总是拒绝——如果儿子感染，回家再传给儿媳和6岁的孙子，怎么办？。
Parents always refuse - what if their son gets infected and passes it on to his daughter-in-law and 6-year-old grandson?
悲伤需要宣泄，但封城状态下，逝者家属的悼念方式太有限了——有人向着殡仪馆方向磕头，有人在网络上记录逝者的故事。
Grief needs catharsis, but in a closed city, bereaved families have too few ways to mourn - someone kowtow to the funeral home, someone on the Internet records the stories of the dead.
。
.
近期，雷五明已通过微信群，为三个逝者家庭召集了线上追悼会，逝者的亲友、社区干部和心理咨询志愿者等被拉到一个群里，亲友用语音、文字来哀悼，其他人发流泪、双手合十等表情。
Recently, through the micro-group, Lei Wuming has convened online memorial services for the families of the three deceased. Relatives and friends of the deceased, community cadres and volunteer counselors have been dragged into a group. Friends and relatives mourn in words and in words, while others show tears and clasped hands.
。
.
时间不能太久，每位逝者大约40分钟。
Not for long, about 40 minutes for each deceased person.
家属可能会哭泣，消耗大量的体力，获得情绪的宣泄，也从亲友的安慰中获得能量。
The family may cry, expend a lot of energy, get emotional outpourings, and derive energy from the comfort of family and friends.
“每个线上的亲友追悼群，都像一个支撑伤痛的房子，但这只是暂时的应急方案。
"Every online mourning group, like a house to support the pain, but this is only a temporary emergency solution.
”。
"
王鹏还不知道何时可以去殡仪馆，当时殡仪馆电话来得突然，他没听清，以为是“御景山”，网上查了下，他猜测应该是“玉笋山”殡仪馆，一个此前他从未想过要去关注的地方。
Wang Peng did not know when to go to the funeral parlour, when the funeral parlour telephone suddenly, he did not hear clearly, think it is "Yue King Shan," under the Internet, he speculated that it should be "Jasparagus Hill" funeral home, a place he had never thought to pay attention to before.
