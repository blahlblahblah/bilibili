这次来武汉，我从楼上看下去，整个大街空无一人，这样的武汉我第一次见湘雅二医院医护人员全副武装，进入隔离病房。
This visit to Wuhan, I looked down from the upstairs, the whole street is empty, such Wuhan I saw Xiangya II Hospital for the first time the medical staff fully armed, into the isolation ward.
受访者供图，下同一瓶剁辣椒，一支哮喘药，湘雅二医院的刘先领找齐“保命”的家伙，准备去武汉。
The interviewee supplied the picture, under the same bottle of pepper, an asthma medicine, Xiangya II hospital Liu Xianqi found the "life-saving" guy, ready to go to Wuhan.
这是元宵节前一天，刘先领接到电话——次日带领湘雅二医院第三批医疗队援鄂。
This is the day before the Lantern Festival, Liu Xiangli received a phone call - the next day led Xiangya II Hospital the third medical team to Hubei.
医疗队由30名医生和100名护士组成，是湘雅二医院规模最大的一次外援，出发前他直言压力很大。
The medical team, composed of 30 doctors and 100 nurses, is the largest foreign aid in Xiangya II Hospital.
他们的目的地是武汉同济医院中法新城院区（下文简称“同济中法院区”），这个医院集结了北协和、南湘雅、和北大一院、北大三院、北大人民医院、北京医院、中日友好医院等18支顶尖医疗队，是当前中国重症医学人才最密集的前线医院,也是湖北新冠肺炎患者的最后一道防线。
Their destination is the Franco-Xincheng District of Wuhan Tongji Hospital (hereinafter referred to as "Tongji Court District"), which has 18 top medical teams, including North Concorde, South Xiangya, Peking University, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking Hospital and Sino-Japanese Friendship Hospital.
截至2月21日10点，该院累计收治重症患者1293人，累计治愈出院137人。
As of 10: 00 on February 21, the hospital had treated a total of 1,293 seriously ill patients and cured 137 cumulative cases.
据了解，同济中法院区的重症患者以60岁以上老人为大多数，医院成立了联合医务处，全国支援队每天通过疑难病例专家会诊、死亡病例讨论、医护联合查房等方式来提高重症患者治愈率，降低死亡率。
It is understood that the majority of patients in the Tongzhong Court District are over 60 years of age. The Joint Medical Service has been set up in the hospital, and the National Support Team has been working daily to improve the recovery rate and reduce the mortality rate of patients in serious condition through specialist consultation on difficult cases, discussion of death cases and joint medical check-ups.
在同济中法院区支援的医护人员参加疑难病例会诊刘先领对《中国新闻周刊》表示，“湖北特别是武汉实际上还是积累了大量的重症患者，所以死亡率会比其他省份高很多。
"Hubei province, Wuhan in particular, has actually accumulated a large number of serious cases, so the mortality rate will be much higher than in other provinces," Liu Xianleading told China News Weekly.
但随着国家要求的“整体摸排、应收尽收”，把感染患者全部找出来以后，接下来的攻坚战虽然很难，但应该很快会有一个好的结局。
But with the national requirements of the "overall mapping, receivable," the infected patients are all found out, the next battle, although difficult, should soon have a good end.
”刘先领向《中国新闻周刊》讲述了湘雅二医院支援队这些天在危重症病人救治前线的故事。
"Liu led a story to China News Weekly about the Xiangya II hospital support team treating patients in critical condition on the front lines these days.
以下是他的自述。
The following is his account of himself.
一支哮喘药，一瓶剁辣椒7号晚上7点左右，我正在家里吃饭，接到医院领导来电，让我次日带130人医疗队接管同济中法院区的50张重症病床。
An asthma medication, a bottle of pepper 7 At around 7 p.m., I was at home eating, received a call from the hospital leadership, and asked me to take the 130-member medical team the next day to take over 50 critically ill beds in the Tongzhong courthouse district.
2月8日元宵节，我们130名队员一早来到医院再次进行安全防护培训，紧接着打包带去武汉的物资。
February 8 Lantern Festival, we 130 members of the early morning to the hospital for safety training, immediately followed by packing materials to Wuhan.
前线物资紧张，国家卫健委要求支援队伍自带7天防护物资。
Frontline supplies are tight, the National Health Commission asked the support team to bring their own seven-day protective materials.
医院给我们准备了200多箱，其中有药品、手术衣、防护服、隔离衣、口罩、帽子、手套，还有方便面等生活用品。
The hospital has prepared more than 200 boxes of medicine, surgical clothes, protective clothing, protective clothing, masks, hats, gloves and other daily necessities such as instant noodles.
为了更好地防护，我们男队友基本剃了光头，长头发的女性选择头发剪短。
For better protection, our male teammates basically shaved their heads and the long-haired women chose to have their hair cut short.
这是从记事我第一次剪光头，我们笑说是“光头小分队”。
It was the first time I had a haircut, and we laughed and said it was a "skinhead team."
剃光头这个事，一是避免滋生病毒的环境，二是表明我们要和这个病毒抗争到底的一种决心。
Shaving our heads is both a way to avoid a virus-breeding environment and a determination to fight the virus to the end.
疫情发生后，我很早就递交了到前线战“疫”的请愿书，一直处于待命状态。
After the outbreak, I submitted an early petition to the front to fight the "epidemic," which has been on standby.
但真正要出发了，说实话，心情很复杂。
But it's time to get going. To tell you the truth, it's complicated.
医务人员一腔热血，在前线使尽浑身解数把病人治好，作为队长，保护他们的安全是重中之重。
The medical staff worked hard to heal the patients on the front lines. As team leaders, protecting their safety was a top priority.
万一我们队伍发生了交叉感染，对我来讲是一个非常大的打击。
In the event of a cross-infection of our team, it would be a big blow to me.
另外，我一直有哮喘的毛病，一旦我发生了感染，后果会比别人更严重一些。
In addition, I've always had asthma, and once I get an infection, the consequences are worse than others.
我离不开两件东西，一个是湖南的剁辣椒，第二个就是我喷的哮喘药，这次我都带上了。
I can't do without two things, one is Hunan's chopped chili, the second is the asthma medicine I sprayed, this time I took.
当时心里就是想，如若不回，那便不回吧。
At that time, the mind is thinking, if not back, then do not go back.
刘先领带去武汉的哮喘药和剁辣椒我们队伍是湘雅二医院第三批援鄂医疗队伍，也是湘雅二医院应对突发公共卫生事件派出的有史以来最大规模的外援队伍。
Liu Xiang tie to Wuhan asthma medicine and chopped pepper our team is the third Xiangya II hospital medical team, but also Xiangya II Hospital to respond to public health emergencies sent the largest-ever foreign aid team.
这130人的高配团队里，有30位来自重症医学科、感染科、呼吸与危重症科等专科的主任专家和青年医学骨干，还有100位重症护理的护士。
The 130-strong team includes 30 leading specialists and young medical cadres in specialties such as intensive care, infection, respiratory and critical care, and 100 nurses in intensive care.
我的儿子比较内向，平常从不向我表露情感，这次我看得出来，他挺担心我的。
My son is more introverted and usually never shows his feelings to me. This time I can see that he is worried about me.
出发那天，他一大早就起床，帮我背着行李，默默跟在后面送我，最后要走的时候我们抱了一下，我看得到他眼眶里的泪。
On the day he left, he got up early in the morning, helped me carry my luggage, followed me in silence, and finally left with a hug that I could see the tears in his eyes.
他对我说，要做好防护，早日凯旋。
He said to me to do a good job of protection, an early victory.
防护是重中之重从数据上看，全国的情况都在好转。
Protection is a top priority The statistics show things are improving all over the country.
湖北积累了大量重症和危重症的病人，所以死亡率会比全国要高很多。
Hubei has accumulated a large number of severe and critically ill patients, so the mortality rate will be much higher than the national rate.
因此国家下大力气，把各个顶尖医院的专家调到武汉。
Therefore, the country has made great efforts to transfer experts from various top hospitals to Wuhan.
国家卫健委统计，全国10%的重症力量都来到武汉支援了。
National Health Commission statistics, 10% of the country's severe force came to Wuhan to support.
现在，同济中法院区是武汉治疗重症和危重症患者的集合地。
Now, Tongzhong court district is Wuhan treatment of severe and critically ill patients gathering place.
北协和、南湘雅、还有中日友好医院、北医三院等强院派来了18支医疗队伍，和同济医院一起，接管了这里的23个病区。
Bei Concorde and Nanxiang Ya, as well as the China-Japan Friendship Hospital and the Beijingsan Hospital, sent 18 medical teams to take over the 23 sick areas along with Tongji Hospital.
我有很多老师、同学、老同行也来了。
I have a lot of teachers, classmates, old colleagues also came.
但我们最多就打个电话，问一下平安，都没办法见面，每个人在自己的岗位上发挥着光和热，一切尽在不言中。
But the most we can do is to call and ask for peace, there is no way to meet, everyone in their posts play the light and heat, everything does not speak.
虽说我们经过多次防护训练，但90%的队员没有接触过这种病人。
Although we had many protective drills, 90 percent of the team had no contact with this patient.
可以看出来，刚开始大家都有点惶恐和紧张，但没有一个人退缩。
As you can see, everyone was a bit apprehensive and nervous at first, but no one flinched.
2月9号深夜，我们接到命令，开始连夜收治重症、危重症病人。
Late at night on February 9, we received orders to begin overnight treatment of critically ill and critically ill patients.
通过13个小时连续工作，我们在2月10日13点左右，把50张床位收满并展开了相应的救治工作。
After 13 hours of continuous work, we filled up 50 beds and began treating them at around 13 o'clock on February 10.
这是一个漂亮的开局，前线和大后方的同事都有了信心。
It was a good start, and colleagues on the front lines and on the home front were confident.
我们的病房是由骨科病房临时改造的，由于时间紧迫，很多硬件没办法达到新冠病毒的防护标准。
Our ward was temporarily modified by the orthopaedic ward, and many hardware was unable to meet the new crown virus protection standards due to time constraints.
严格来讲，传染病的病房是需要进和出双通道的，现在进和出都是一个通道，当我们进病区的时候，就不能有人出来。
Strictly speaking, the ward of infectious disease is needed to enter and leave the two channels, now in and out is a passageway, when we enter the sick area, no one can come out.
根据这个情况我们也想了办法，医护人员进到隔离区查房、护理时，会用一部里面专用的手机拍下病人的状况，传给我们。
According to this situation, we also thought of a way, medical staff into the quarantine area to check, nursing, will use a dedicated mobile phone to photograph the patient's condition, to us.
另外，污染区和清洁区的医护人员还可以通过对讲机沟通病情、开医嘱。
In addition, contaminated areas and clean areas of medical personnel can also communicate through walkie-talkies, doctor's orders.
我们刚来的时候，一天要用到两百套左右防护装备，这样优化之后，基本上八九十套就够用。
When we first arrived, we needed about 200 sets of protective gear a day, so that when optimized, basically eighty or ninety units would be enough.
但是，防护物资整体来讲还是比较紧张。
However, the overall protection material is still relatively tense.
你比如说这个鞋套，我们一开始是用蓝色的医疗垃圾袋把鞋子包上，再裹在腿上用胶布固定。
You know, you know, this shoe cover, we started out with a blue medical dustbin bag, then wrapped it in your legs and glued it in.
还有防护服，一开始只有加大号的，我们瘦小的队员穿上以后就看不到影子了。
And protective clothing, at the beginning only to enlarge the number, we small players put on after the shadow can not see.
但是情况一天天在变好，医务人员都能做到三级防护。
But the situation is getting better day by day, and medical staff are able to provide tertiary protection.
由于物资不足，一度只有最大码防护服进隔离病区前，我们要花半个多小时穿上隔离衣、防护服、手套、帽子、护目镜等防护装备。
Due to lack of supplies, it took us more than half an hour to put on protective equipment such as paraphernalia, protective clothing, gloves, hats, goggles, etc. before the largest size of protective clothing ever entered the quarantine area.
为了确保防护质量，我请护士长在换衣间安排了老师督导，确保每位医护人员防护到位了，才在防护服上写好名字，再写一句加油，画一个爱心，给大家打气。
To ensure the quality of the protection, I asked the head nurse to arrange a teacher's supervision in the changing room to ensure that every health care worker was in place before writing the name on the protective clothing.
从病房出来消毒的时间更长，医护人员脱下层层防护设备后，要洗手、洗澡、用生理盐水漱口、络合碘清理鼻腔和外耳道，确保他们的安全。
After taking off layers of protective equipment, they should wash their hands, bathe, rinse their mouths with saline, and complexe iodine to clean the nasal and external auditory canal to ensure their safety.
医院的安保和保洁人员也让人非常感动，他们没有经过充分的防护培训，但是时刻坚守在岗位上。
Hospital security and cleaning personnel are also very moved, they did not have adequate protection training, but always adhere to the post.
每次看到他们进污染区，我都会请医护人员仔细帮他们穿好防护设备。
Every time I see them coming into the contaminated area, I ask the paramedics to help them put on the protective gear carefully.
我们医生是三班倒，每班8小时，进病房的护士是4个小时左右一轮换，每次进去6到8位护士，负责50名患者，厚重装备下进行各种操作，工作强度还是挺大的。
Our doctors worked three shifts of eight hours each, the nurses who entered the ward rotated for about four hours, took in six to eight nurses at a time, and were responsible for 50 patients.
为了避免感染，病房里是没有空调的，当气温在零度左右的时候，防护服里面的衣服湿了又干，干了又湿。
To avoid infection, there is no air conditioning in the ward. When the temperature is around zero, the clothes inside the suit are wet and dry, dry and wet.
我们有三位队员可能就是这样感冒了，还有点发烧。
Three of our players might have caught a cold and had a fever.
根据我们的判断，应该是没有感染新冠肺炎的迹象。
According to our judgement, there should be no sign of new crown pneumonia.
我们现在暂停了他们的工作，成立了一个关爱小组，每天把饭送到他们酒店房间门口，让他们尽可能地先休养。
We have now suspended their work and set up a care group to take their meals daily to the door of their hotel room so that they can rest as much as possible.
我对队员反复强调，要充分休息，保住免疫力。
I repeatedly stressed to the players to take a full rest, to maintain immunity.
我这次带了安眠药，基本上每天都要吃，就是希望晚上能好好睡一觉。
I took sleeping pills this time, and I ate them almost every day, hoping for a good night's sleep.
我们的酒店在距离医院30分钟车程的地方，有专门的车子接送上下班，医护人员经常半夜三更要去医院，都有车子坐。
Our hotel is 30 minutes away from the hospital, there is a special car to and from work, medical staff often have to go to the hospital in the middle of the night, there are cars.
每天很多志愿者打电话来要给我们送东西。
Many volunteers call every day to deliver things to us.
他们想得很周到，因为酒店也不能开空调，就送来了电热毯、暖宝宝，担心我们不能按点吃饭，就送方便面、牛奶、水果等等。
They thought very carefully, because the hotel can not open the air-conditioning, sent electric blanket, warm baby, worried that we can not eat by the point, send instant noodles, milk, fruit, and so on.
其实，我们对于吃住没有要求，我们每一顿盒饭有三个菜，顿顿能吃上青菜，已经很好了。
In fact, we do not ask for food and shelter, we have three meals a box of rice, Donghton can eat vegetables, has been very good.
暂无公认疗法应对炎症风暴同济中法院区收治的都是重症病人，死亡率在百分之八左右。
There is no recognized treatment for inflammatory storm Tongji court district are admitted to severe patients, the death rate of about 8 percent.
我们接手这个病区以来，没有死亡病例，另外有近20个病人从重症转为轻症了。
There have been no deaths since we took over the area, and nearly 20 patients have gone from severe to mild.
这两天已经复查病毒核酸和CT，我估计他们中有相当一部分人很快能出院。
The virus nucleic acid and CT have been reviewed over the past two days, and I estimate that quite a few of them will be discharged soon.
湘雅二医院负责的病房每个重症患者都有一套个性化的治疗方案，我们对患者的精神状态、营养、睡眠包括心理也有一个全方位的指导。
Xiangya II Hospital is responsible for the ward every serious patient has a personalized treatment plan, we also have a comprehensive mental state, nutrition, sleep including psychological guidance.
对于重症患者来说，老是躺在床上不利于康复。
For the seriously ill, lying in bed all the time is not conducive to recovery.
我们会鼓励患者在没吸氧、没打吊针的时候，下床做一些力所能及的运动。
We encourage people to get out of bed and do as much exercise as they can when there is no oxygen or needle.
这样不仅可以促进他们肠道的蠕动，还可以促进肺部呼吸功能的改善、减少血拴的发生。
This not only promotes the peristalsis of their intestine, but also promotes the improvement of pulmonary respiratory function and reduces the occurrence of blood tie.
在用药层面上，我们病区参与了两个临床研究，一个是包括瑞德西韦在内的新药研究，另一个是关于激素用量的研究。
At the drug level, our area is involved in two clinical studies, one on new drugs, including Rhetsevir, and the other on hormone use.
我注意到网上有一些中西医互掐的情况，中医说中药要发挥主导作用，西医说中医不行。
I noticed that some Chinese and Western medicine pinch each other on the net. Traditional Chinese medicine should play a leading role.
其实，我们主张中西医结合治疗，国家要求尽量提高患者的中药补给和中药使用率，我们的队伍有两名中医专家，可以给病人提供个体化的中药治疗。
In fact, we advocate the combination of Chinese and Western medicine treatment, the state demands to improve the patient's Chinese medicine supply and Chinese medicine usage rate, our team has two Chinese medicine experts, can provide patients with individual Chinese medicine treatment.
炎症风暴对于危重症病人来说是一道未知的坎。
Inflammatory storms are an unknown barrier for critically ill patients.
我们免疫系统和病毒抗争的过程中，会产生炎症因子。
Inflammatory factors are produced when our immune system fights viruses.
炎症在不同人身上轻重程度不同，在有的情况下就会形成炎症风暴。
Inflammation in different people with different degrees of severity, in some cases will form a storm of inflammation.
对于新冠病毒导致的炎症风暴，实际上还没有公认的处理手段，现在前线医生都还在摸索过程中。
There is virtually no accepted treatment for the inflammatory storm caused by the new crown virus, and front-line doctors are still groping.
总的来说，我们要尽量在炎症风暴早期就干预进去，密切观察，早发现，早治疗。
In general, we should try to intervene early in the inflammatory storm, closely observe, early detection, early treatment.
打个比方，炎症风暴形成过程就像瀑布一样，一开始水流是比较小的，等到它演变成瀑布，就只能通过血液透析、血浆置换等手段把炎症因子从体内透析出来。
For example, the formation of an inflammatory storm is like a waterfall. At first, the flow of water is small. When it turns into a waterfall, the inflammatory factor can only be dialyzed out of the body by means of hemodialysis, plasma replacement, etc.
大家也注意到，这次新冠肺炎救治过程中，我们在部分患者身上使用了激素。
It was also noted that we used hormones in some patients during the treatment of the new crown pneumonia.
激素就是对抗炎症因子的，它对免疫系统有抑制作用。
Hormone is an anti-inflammatory factor that inhibits the immune system.
根据目前数据，使用中等剂量激素不会引起非常明显的毒素作用。
According to current data, the use of moderate doses of hormones does not cause very significant toxic effects.
我经常来武汉做学术交流，对这座城市非常熟悉。
I often come to Wuhan to do academic exchanges, the city is very familiar.
这次来武汉，我从楼上看下去，整个大街空无一人，这样的武汉我第一次见。
This visit to Wuhan, I looked down from the upstairs, the whole street empty, such as Wuhan I saw for the first time.
最近几天，路上的车辆明显多起来了，整个城市开始慢慢缓过劲来了。
In recent days there has been a noticeable increase in traffic on the road and the whole city is beginning to pick up steam.
特别前几天一场风雪以后，阳光明媚犀利，这场战役的阴霾应该也快消散了吧！等疫情结束了，我要回去调整一下心态，然后尽快回到武汉来，和武汉的同道们进行学术交流。
After a snowstorm a few days ago, the sun was shining brilliantly, and the haze of the battle should soon have dissipated! When the epidemic is over, I will go back to Wuhan to adjust my mind and return to Wuhan as soon as possible to have academic exchanges with my colleagues in Wuhan.
