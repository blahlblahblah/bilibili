文/王巧编辑/独秀头图来源于网络新年伊始，全国战“疫”，确诊病例与日俱增，从几百、几千，上万，数字的增加牵动着每个国人的心。
From the beginning of the new year, the nation has seen an increase in the number of confirmed cases, ranging from a few hundred, a few thousand, to tens of thousands, and the increase in numbers is affecting the hearts of every nation.
各路救援物资陆续抵达武汉，然而，物资堆积在武汉红十字会的仓库，迟迟发不出去。
All kinds of relief materials have arrived in Wuhan, however, the materials piled up in Wuhan Red Cross warehouse, the delay in sending out.
救命的医疗物资卡死在“最后一公里”，无疑是最令人痛心的。
The death of life-saving medical supplies in the "last mile" is undoubtedly the most distressing.
究其原因，是物资管理的低效与信息不透明。
The reasons for this are the inefficiency of material management and the opacity of information.
短时内大批量物资对于红十字会而言已是“超纲考题”，公众对于捐赠物资的去向一无所知，更是雪上加霜。
This is compounded by the fact that large quantities of material in a short period of time have become an "over-examination" for the Red Cross and the public knows nothing about the whereabouts of the donated materials.
针对红十字会内部工作效率低下、管理混乱、分配不公问题，刘明瑞告诉锌链接，“病毒”的传播具有“指数级”的威力，红十字会用落后的“线性”系统去应对指数级的危机都很难成功。
Liu told Zinc Link that the spread of the virus was "exponential," and that the Red Cross had a hard time responding to index-level crises with backward "linear" systems.
而且，“病毒”传播通常都带有很大的不确定性，复杂性，需要极高的应对时效性。
Moreover, "virus" transmission is usually very uncertain, complex, and requires a very high response time.
物资哪去了？这个武汉红会回答不了的问题，区块链等技术或许可以。
Where are the materials? This Wuhan Red Cross will not answer the question of the chain of blocks and other technologies may be possible.
清华大学新闻与传播学院教授、微博大V“新媒沈阳”发微博称，本质来说物资的分配和信息的推送都是类似的。
'Essentially, the distribution of materials and the delivery of information are similar, 'says Wei Bodhi, a professor at Tsinghua University's School of Journalism and Communication and a microblogger called' the new medium Shenyang '.
信息推送今天已经走到了智能推荐时代，而物资的分配也应该引入AI、区块链、云计算和大数据（ABCD），并且全程全效全息全员可以查询。
Information delivery is now in the age of intelligent recommendation, and the distribution of materials should introduce AI, block chains, cloud computing, and large data (ABCD), and be accessible to all full-time holographic personnel.
物资信息上链首先，一贯的信息不透明，导致红十字会信用严重缺失只有数据透明了，才便于接受公众监督，才能发现分配数量是否真实，分配过程是否快速，分配结果是否公平。
First, the lack of transparency in the material information chain leads to a serious lack of credit for the Red Cross. Only if the data are transparent can it be easily monitored by the public to see whether the assigned amount is real, whether the distribution process is fast and whether the results are fair.
WeSpace可信数字生态创始人宣宏量告诉锌链接，区块链是一个“自证可信”的体系。
WeSpace's Credible Digital Eco founder Sun Hongquan told Zinc Link that the block chain is a "self-authenticated" system.
任何一个提供公共服务或者产品生产、销售机构，敢把核心数据上链，说明敢于“自证清白”；不敢上链，一旦工作中失误公开化，那肯定会遭到更多的公众质疑。
Any organization that provides public services or produces or sells products dares to chain up its core data to show that it dares to "prove its innocence"; it does not dare to be chained, and when mistakes are made publicly at work, there is bound to be more public scepticism.
他认为，可以利用云计算和区块链技术构建一个可信的医疗物资管理系统，推动医疗物资管理模式创新。
In his view, cloud computing and block chain technology could be used to build a credible medical material management system that would drive innovation in the management of medical materials.
即在原有管理模式基础之上，增加关键节点核心数据的签发上链环节。
That is, on the basis of the original management model, add the key node core data issue chain link.
通过云链端协同，云端负责数据计算、证据存储和数据查询，链端负责可信数据和可信证据存储与查证，客户端提供数据采集、云链互动，从而打造一个全新的可信的公共服务体系。
Cloud end is responsible for data computation, evidence storage and data query, chain end is responsible for credible data and reliable evidence storage and verification, client data collection, cloud chain interaction, thus creating a new and credible public service system.
其次，要想解决医疗物资分配问题，就要将整个流程彻底公开，不管是捐赠者、公众还是需求方，都能清楚看见每笔物资的流向，让每笔物资都能落到实处。
Second, if the distribution of medical supplies is to be addressed, the entire process needs to be thoroughly disclosed, whether on the donor, public or demand side, so that each item can be accounted for.
长虹信息安全实验室首席科学家唐博告诉锌链接：“需要将前后端的数据打通，使捐赠数据和分配数据都公示，参与角色包括捐赠者、分配者和监督者，其次需要明确各自权力和义务，系统强制执行。
"There is a need to open up the front and back end of the data so that donor data and distribution data are publicly available," Tang Bo, chief scientist at Changhong Information Security Laboratory, told Zinc Link.
”据新京报消息，中国人民大学国家发展与战略研究院青岛分院院长、公共管理学院副教授张楠迪扬也认为，在资源配置上，传统技术手段很难实现社会资源跨部门、跨领域的综合实时信息共享及开放。
According to the Beijing News, Zhang Nandi, dean of Qingdao branch of the National Institute of Development and Strategic Studies at Renmin University of China and associate professor of the School of Public Administration, agrees that traditional technological means are difficult to achieve comprehensive and real-time information sharing and openness across sectors and fields in allocating resources.
“面对公共卫生危机，利用区块链技术构建物资链，实现社会各界各部门的可供物资的数据整合，在全国范围实时了解物资产量、库存、追踪运输。
"In the face of the public health crisis, the use of block chain technology to build the material chain, achieve the integration of the various sectors of society's available data, real-time nationwide understanding of material production, inventory, tracking transport.
区块链技术下，物资始发地、走向、滞留地，分发情况都可在链上实时记账，数据多点存储，并向社会公布。
Under the chain-of-blocks technology, the origin, direction and location of the materiel, distribution can be recorded in real time on the chain, and data are stored at multiple points and made available to the public.
物资的配送情况清晰可见，全社会可以共同监督，提高资源配置效率，增强社会互信。
The distribution of materials is clearly visible, and the whole society can jointly supervise it, improve the efficiency of resource allocation and enhance mutual trust.
”近日，趣链科技便联合海尔智家、中国雄安集团等企业开始研发“捐赠物资溯源平台”。
Recently, Interesting Chain Technology joined forces with Haier Zhi-jia, China Xiong An Group and other enterprises to develop a "donor traceability platform."
根据设想，国内外许多机构都分布在这个平台上，每当有人或者有机构希望往某个机构捐助一批物资时，只要在平台上简单登记，就能看到捐赠详情、物流跟踪、物资接收、物资落实等全部流程，而且，还可实时看到需求动态，全流程可溯源、难篡改，解决“需求难发声、捐赠难到位、群众难相信”的三大难题。
It is envisaged that many institutions at home and abroad will be located on this platform, and whenever someone or an organization wishes to donate an item to an institution, a simple registration on the platform will reveal all the processes of donation details, logistics tracking, material receipt and material implementation.
据锌链接了解，该项目预计2月上线。
According to Zinc Link, the project is expected to go live in February.
此外，要想实现全流程公开透明，还需借助物联网技术。
In addition, open and transparent processes require the use of Internet of Things technology.
德方智链金融研究室主任袁东阳告诉锌链接，结合将关于物资的种类、数量、配送要求、受配对象、分配要求以及分配后的结果等信息，以及依靠物联网采集的物资位移、时间和状态等信息上链，并开放给分配者、受配者、政府机构、物流公司等主体，实现数据共享和比对，就能确保所有关于物资分配的信息透明、及时、真实地被各方所获悉，避免物资丢失、错配，提高物资分配的时效性和准确性。
Yuan Dongyang, director of the financial research department of the German side of Zinc Link, told Zinc Link that combining information on types, quantities, distribution requirements, recipients, distribution requirements and post-distribution results, as well as sharing and matching data among distributors, recipients, government agencies and logistics companies, can ensure transparent, timely and truthful information on material distribution.
站在技术的角度，区块链的确可以做到公开透明，但ArcBlock 创办人兼CEO冒志鸿认为，还有组织、体制、法律等问题。
Technically, the block chain does provide transparency, but ArcBlock's founder and CEO reckons there are also organizational, institutional, and legal issues.
IT系统是为人服务的，尤其涉及捐赠物资这样的系统，首先要保证数据本身是准确的，放到链上才有意义，其次要确保执行是到位的，链只能保证链上状态，不能保证是否真的贯彻执行了。
IT systems are for people, especially for systems such as donated goods, first to ensure that the data itself is accurate and meaningful in the chain, and secondly, to ensure that the implementation is in place and that the chain only guarantees the state of the chain and not the actual implementation.
数字身份，智能匹配物资医疗物资全流程公开透明后，再为医疗物资需求单位和供给单位颁发合法数字身份证书，使得发布的需求和供给信息真实有效，这样能够合理、正确地匹配真实需求，让医疗物资发挥最大效用。
After the entire process of medical materials is open and transparent, legitimate digital identity cards are issued to demand and supply units of medical materials, making the published demand and supply information real and effective, so that real needs can be reasonably and correctly matched and medical supplies can be used to maximum effect.
德方智链技术总监袁运亮告诉锌链接，为医疗物资需求单位和供给单位颁发合法数字身份，医疗物资需求单位按类、数目、质量等维度将需求上链，医疗物资供给单位将能供给的物资信息也按对应维度上链，线上智能匹配，物资点对点的分配，全链路溯源，并引入监管部门进行审计。
Yuan Yunliang, the technical director of the German chain of intelligence, told Zinc Link that legal digital identity was issued to demand units and suppliers of medical materials. Units of medical material demand would supply demand according to dimensions such as category, number and quality.
需求和供给方保持每日进行数据维护更新，整个物资分配过程透明、高效，加快医疗物资的合理正确分配。
Demand and supply side maintain daily data maintenance update, transparent and efficient material distribution process, accelerate the rational and correct distribution of medical materials.
袁运亮补充道，只有具有合法的数字身份证书才能使用平台发布需求，提供供给信息，防止非法的、不真实的需求和供给信息，保证信息准确性。
Yuan added that only legitimate digital ID cards can be used to publish demand, provide information, prevent illegal and unreal demand and supply information, and ensure the accuracy of information.
其次，智能匹配，点对点分配，可以不经过中间方（武汉红十字会）。
Secondly, intelligent match, point-to-point allocation, can not go through the intermediary (Wuhan Red Cross).
图片来源：作者绘制供给方直接对接需求方，对需求的了解也会更精准，物资调配也会更快速。

指数型危机需要“指数型组织”应对指数型的危机，我们需要的是一个更高效，更有韧性的未来系统。
Indexed crises require "exponential organizations" to cope with exponential crises, and what we need is a more efficient and resilient future system.
正如奇点大学的萨利姆伊斯梅尔在《指数型组织》中所提出的观点，我认为未来系统的核心在于自组织、社区及大众，信息可信和网络协同。
As Salim Ismail of Singularity University put it in the Index Organization, I believe that the core of the future system is self-organization, community, and the general public, information credibility, and network synergy.
区块链技术的不可篡改，可追溯，全透明的特性，可以在未来系统中发挥核心的作用。
The immutable, traceable and fully transparent nature of block chain technology can play a central role in the future system.
刘明瑞告诉锌链接：“过去系统强大的标准是拥有多少资源，未来系统强大的标准是如何让资源高效流动。
"The strong yardstick of the past was how much resources you had," Liu told Zinc Link. "The strong yardstick for a future system is how efficiently resources flow."
红会这样的传统组织即使拥有再多的资源，如果无法高效的去把资源调动流转，注定不是应对危机时的强大系统。
A traditional organization like the Red Cross, with all its resources, is not destined to be a powerful system in times of crisis if it is not able to mobilize resources efficiently.
图片来源：受访者提供每个指数型组织都有着一个宏大的充满变革感的目标，当有了这么一个宏大的目标以后，整个组织内部矛盾就减少了，就会变成一致对外。
Source: Respondents provide that each exponential organization has an ambitious goal of being transformative, and when such an ambitious goal is achieved, internal contradictions throughout the organization are reduced and become uniform.
其次，指数型组织都不会拥有海量的员工，但是有海量的人在干活，最有价值的东西由社群和大众提供。
Second, exponential organizations do not have large numbers of employees, but there are huge numbers of people working, and the most valuable things are provided by communities and the general public.
你不需要有自己的专业人员，你只需要给他们提供一个平台，社群会和大众会贡献特别多的力量。
You don't need to have your own professionals, you just need to provide them with a platform where the community and the public can contribute a lot.
未来，权利从核心向边缘转移。
In the future, power shifts from the core to the periphery.
未来，应对社会不确定性，需要的是利用新一代信息技术赋能的新型组织。
What is needed in the future to deal with social uncertainty is a new kind of organization that utilizes a new generation of information technology empowerment.
”此次疫情，科技的力量随处可见。
The power of technology is everywhere in this epidemic.
比如，武汉火神山医院，华为配合三大运营商仅用4天就搭建完成4/5G 无线网络及专线网络；AI也成为前线医务人员的重要加持力量，阿里达摩院研发的AI算法可将原来数小时的疑似病例基因分析缩短至半小时，大幅缩短确诊时间，并能精准检测出病毒的变异情况；此外，为了进一步加快新疫苗、新药的研发和上市，BAT等国内众多科技公司纷纷向科研机构免费开放自己的 AI 算力。
For example, Wuhan Fosen Mountain Hospital, Huawei worked with the three major operators to build a 4 / 5G wireless network and dedicated line network in just four days. AI has also become an important enabler for frontline medical staff.
然而，科技的参与度仍远远不够。
However, participation in science and technology is still far from adequate.
武汉红会便是一个典型例子，无论数字经济的口号再响亮，关键时刻的“短板”，足以暴露数字化普及的诸多问题。
Wuhan Red Cross Society is a typical example, no matter how loud the slogan of the digital economy, the critical "short board", enough to expose the many problems of digital popularization.
希望当我们再次面临同样困难时，有更多科技的助力：有区块链技术能够帮助信息透明化；有物联网对医疗物资流动路径进行跟踪，为上链数据的真实性提供保障；有云计算对海量数据进行快速计算；还有为医疗物资需求单位和供给单位颁发合法数字身份，能够合理匹配需求，让医疗物资发挥最大效用。
Hopefully, when we face the same difficulties again, there will be more technology: block-chain technology can help make information transparent; the Internet of Things can track the flow of medical supplies and guarantee the authenticity of the data on the chain; cloud computing can quickly compute big data; and legitimate digital identities can be issued to medical demand and supply units to match demand rationally and maximize the utility of medical supplies.
