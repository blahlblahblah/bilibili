共27例病例，大多是武汉华南海鲜城经营户。
A total of 27 cases, mostly Wuhan South China Hai Xiancheng operators.
7例病情危重，其余病情可控，有2例病情好转拟近期出院。
Seven cases were critically ill, the rest were controllable, and two cases were expected to be released shortly.
不明原因肺炎，是2003年SARS事件后，对SARS病例和人禽流感病例及其它传染性呼吸道疾病监测中用的概念。
Unknown causes of pneumonia are concepts used in the surveillance of SARS cases and cases of human avian influenza and other infectious respiratory diseases following the SARS incident in 2003.
2004年以来，全国各地也曾多次发现过不明原因肺炎，但并未大规模传播。
Since 2004, pneumonia of unknown origin has been detected several times throughout the country, but has not spread on a large scale.
知情人士透露，一家基因测序公司到武汉进行了初步检测，结果是高度疑似SARS。
According to people familiar with the matter, a genetic sequencing company went to Wuhan to conduct preliminary tests, the results are highly suspected SARS.
但这不是最终结果，今年其他地区也出现过类似高度疑似但最终排除的情况。
But this is not the end result, and there have been similar highly suspicious but ultimately excluded situations in other regions this year.
△图片来源：Yestone昨天（12月30日）晚上开始，武汉出现多例不明原因肺炎的消息开始流传。
2007-9-25 09: 48 After the night of December 30, word began to circulate that there were several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan.
今天早上，八点健闻致电武汉疾控中心，工作人员告诉我们：还不能确认是SARS，病人已经隔离，卫健委专家已经来武汉了，不用惊慌。
This morning, eight JianWen call Wuhan CDC, staff told us: can not confirm it is SARS, patients have been isolated, Wei Jianqi experts have come to Wuhan, do not panic.
SARS（Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome），严重急性呼吸综合征，由 SARS冠状病毒（SARS CoV.)感染引起的烈性传染病。
SARS (Severe Acute Response Syndrome), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-Coronavirus) is a severe infectious disease caused by the SARS Coronavirus (SARS CoV.) infection.
SARS冠状病毒可以感染人或动物，具有高度的传染性和致死性，许多患者在感染早期快速死亡。
SARS coronavirus can infect people or animals. It is highly infectious and deadly. Many patients die very quickly in the early stages of infection.
自2002年11月起，SARS疫情曾迅速蔓延至全球数十个国家和地区，截至2003年7月，全球发病人数达到8098例，其中死亡774例，全球病死率接近10%,其中近半数死者为超过65岁的老年人。
Since November 2002, the SARS epidemic has spread rapidly to dozens of countries and regions around the world. As of July 2003, the number of cases worldwide had reached 8,098, of which 774 were deaths.
在我国，SARS疫情首发于广东，而以北京最为严重，随着全国范围的严防严控，患者隔离治疗，疫情迅速得到遏制。
In China, the SARS epidemic started in Guangdong, and Beijing was the worst. With strict nationwide control and patient isolation, the epidemic was quickly contained.
2003年疫情解除，2004年之后未有临床感染、发病的报告。
The outbreak was relieved in 2003 and no clinical infection or disease was reported after 2004.
就在刚才，武汉卫健委发布消息，不明原因肺炎是病毒性肺炎，目前已发现27例病例，其中7例病情严重，其余病例病情稳定可控，有2例病情好转拟于近期出院。
Just now, Wuhan Health Commission announced that the unknown cause of pneumonia is viral pneumonia, 27 cases have been found so far, of which 7 cases are serious, the others are stable and controllable, and 2 cases are expected to be released in the near future.
到目前为止调查未发现明显人传人现象，未发现医务人员感染。
To date, no significant human-to-human transmission has been observed and no infection by medical personnel has been observed.
目前对病原的检测及感染原因的调查正在进行中。
At present the detection of pathogen and the cause of infection are under investigation.
不明原因肺炎，是SARS事件后，2004年当时的卫生部一份文件中出现的概念。
Unexplained pneumonia is a concept that emerged in a 2004 Department of Health document following the SARS incident.
文件中说：为筛查可能的SARS病例和人禽流感病例及其它传染性呼吸道疾病，早期发出预警并采取相应的防控措施，从而防范SARS疫情的扩散蔓延和可能出现的人禽流感疫情，卫生部日前制定了《全国不明原因肺炎病例监测实施方案（试行）》。
In order to prevent the spread of SARS and possible human cases of avian influenza and other infectious respiratory diseases, the Ministry of Health has drawn up a National Implementation Plan for Monitoring Unknown Causes of Pneumonia (Trial), the document said.
文件发布后，全国各地也曾多次发现过不明原因肺炎，但并未大规模传播。
Since the document was issued, pneumonia of unknown origin has been found many times throughout the country, but has not spread on a large scale.
这次武汉的疫情之所以很紧张，据一位知情人士透露，是因为一家基因测序公司到武汉进行了初步检测，检测结果是高度疑似SARS。
The Wuhan epidemic is tense because a genetic sequencing company went to Wuhan to conduct preliminary tests, which turned out to be highly suspicious, according to a person familiar with the matter.
但这并不是最终的结果，冠状病毒有很多种，目前只是一个高度疑似。
But this is not the final result, there are many coronavirus, is currently only a high suspect.
“国家卫健委已经介入，按照程序的话，会将病毒带回北京，多家检测比对来最后确认结果。
"The National Health Commission has stepped in to confirm the results by bringing the virus back to Beijing in accordance with the procedure," he said.
”“据了解，今年在其他地区也出现过类似高度疑似但最终排除的情况。
"It is understood that there have been similar highly suspected but ultimately excluded situations in other regions this year.
大家静观结果，不必恐慌。
Watch the results. Don't panic.
”另一位知情人士表示。
Another person familiar with the matter said.
今天早上，抗病毒概念股拉升，鲁抗医药、联环药业、莱茵生物和四环生物等4股涨停。
This morning, the anti-virus concept unit pulled up, Lu anti-medicine, Lianhuan Pharmaceutical, Rhine biology and four-ring biological limit.

实地探访华南海鲜城：经过消毒后正常经营昨天晚上，两份盖有武汉市卫生健康委员会医政管理处公章的红头文件在网络上广泛传播。
Site visit to Hai Xian City, South China: After disinfection normal operation Last night, two red documents bearing the official seal of the Medical Administration Office of Wuhan Health Commission were widely distributed on the Internet.
文件透露，武汉市华南海鲜市场陆续出现不明原因肺炎病人。
The documents revealed that the South China Seafood Market in Wuhan City, unknown causes of pneumonia patients emerged.
一份名为《市卫生健康委关于报送不明原因肺炎救治情况的紧急通知》，要求各单位清查近期去过华南海鲜市场或在华南海鲜市场附近工作的不明原因肺炎病人，并上报至武汉市卫健委医政处。
An emergency notice issued by the municipal health committee on the treatment of unexplained pneumonia requires organizations to make an inventory of patients with unexplained pneumonia who have recently visited the South China seafood market or worked in the vicinity of the South China seafood market and report it to the Wuhan Health and Wellness Commission Medical Office.

另一份名为《关于做好不明原因肺炎救治工作的紧急通知》指出，部分医疗机构陆续出现不明原因肺炎病人。
Another urgent notice, entitled "Emergency Notice on the Treatment of Unknown Causes of Pneumonia," states that patients with unexplained pneumonia continue to appear in some medical institutions.
各医疗机构要强化门急诊管理，严格执行首诊负责制，发现不明原因肺炎病人积极调动力量就地救治。
All medical institutions should strengthen emergency management, strictly implement the system of first consultation in charge, and find patients with unexplained pneumonia actively mobilize local treatment.
要有针对性地加强呼吸、感染科、重症医学等多学科专业力量，畅通绿色通道。
To strengthen the respiratory, infectious, severe medicine and other multidisciplinary professional forces, unimpeded green channel.

“医院确实接收到了这两份文件。
"The hospital did receive both documents.
”武汉一家三甲医院的主任医生告诉八点健闻，已经在排查疑似病例。
The head doctor at a three-A hospital in Wuhan told Mr. Eight that he had cleared up suspected cases.
武汉协和医院的一名主任医师同样表示，目前是不明原因的肺炎，没有确认病原菌，不能断定是SARS病毒。
A director of Wuhan Concorde Hospital also said the pneumonia, which is unknown, did not identify the pathogen and could not be identified as SARS virus.
12月31日上午，八点健闻致电武汉市疾病预防控制中心得知，目前的进度仍然是确认肺炎，但是还没有确定SARS。
On the morning of December 31, eight JianWen called Wuhan city Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to learn that the current progress is still confirmed pneumonia, but has not confirmed SARS.
国家卫健委已派专家抵达武汉。
The National Health Commission has sent experts to Wuhan.
目前，相关病毒分型检测、隔离治疗、舆情管控、终末消毒等工作正在进行。
At present, the related virus classification detection, isolation treatment, public opinion control, end disinfection and other work is under way.
今天下午，八点健闻的一位朋友到达华南海鲜城，看到这里仍在正常经营。
This afternoon, eight JianWen a friend arrived in Hai Xian City, South China, see here is still in normal operation.
△华南海鲜市场，Hank摄市场内的商户说，早上有人来进行过消毒，他们觉得正常经营没有问题。
At the South China seafood market, Hank photographers say someone came in the morning to disinfect them. They don't think it's a problem.
△华南海鲜市场内部，Hank摄不明原因肺炎：后SARS时代的监控重点病原体明确的肺炎往往在临床表现中有一定的规律，如肺炎球菌性肺炎有发热、咳嗽，肺部听诊有小水泡音，胸片显示片状阴影，可称为典型性肺炎。
South China Seafood Market, Hank Unknown Causes Pneumonia: Post-SARS Era Surveillance Focus Pathogen Specific Pneumonia is often characterized by certain clinical manifestations, such as pneumococcal pneumonia with fever, cough, small blister sounds in lung auscultation, and patchy shadows in chest radiographs, which can be called typical pneumonia.
与之相对的，发热、咳嗽、肺部听诊、胸部X片等临床表现均不典型的肺炎，被称为非典型性肺炎，泛指所有由某种未知的病原体引起的肺炎，可能是冠状病毒、肺炎支原体、肺炎衣原体或嗜肺军团菌引起的肺炎症状，也可泛指不是由细菌所引起的肺炎症状。
In contrast, pneumonia, characterized by atypical clinical manifestations such as fever, cough, pulmonary auscultation, and chest X-rays, is known as atypical pneumonia and refers to all pneumonia caused by an unknown pathogen, possibly coronavirus, mycoplasma pneumoniae or pneumophilus, or pneumonia not caused by bacteria in general.
非典型肺炎并不是可怕的疾病，也不是“不治之症”，只是一种暂时还没有找到明确的病原体之前的过渡性名称。
Atypical pneumonia is not a terrible disease, nor is it an "incurable disease," just a transitional name until a clear pathogen is found.
不明原因肺炎，是继SARS流行之后，卫生部为了更好地及时发现和处理SARS、人禽流感以及其他表现类似、具有一定传染性的肺炎而提出的一个名词。
Unexplained pneumonia is a term coined by the Department of Health following the SARS epidemic to better detect and treat SARS, human avian influenza and other pneumonia with similar and somewhat contagious manifestations.
严格来说，“不明原因肺炎”不是一个严谨的医学概念，而是作为及时发现可疑病例、早期发出预警并采取相应的防控措施的筛查手段。
Strictly speaking, "unexplained pneumonia" is not a rigorous medical concept, but rather a timely detection of suspicious cases, early warning and corresponding prevention and control measures.
具体来看，不明原因肺炎是指同时具备以下4条不能作出明确诊断的肺炎病例：1、发热（≥38℃）；2、具有肺炎或急性呼吸窘迫综合征（ARDS）的影像学特征；3、发病早期白细胞总数降低或正常，或淋巴细胞分类计数减少；4、经抗生素规范治疗3-5天，病情无明显改善。
In particular, pneumonia is defined as pneumonia with four conditions that cannot be clearly diagnosed: 1. Fever (> 38 ° C); 2. Imaging features with pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); 3.
在不明原因肺炎病例中，SARS和人禽流感是两类需要重点预警的情况。
Of the unknown pneumonia cases, SARS and human avian influenza are two types of situations that require focused early warning.
根据2004年原卫生部发布的《全国不明原因肺炎病例监测实施方案（试行）》，符合以下情况之一的不明原因肺炎病例可定为SARS预警病例：1、地市级专家组会诊不能排除SARS的不明原因肺炎病例；2、两例或以上有可疑流行病学联系的不明原因肺炎病例；3、重点人群发生不明原因肺炎病例：医疗机构工作人员中出现的不明原因肺炎病例，可能暴露于SARS病毒或潜在感染性材料的人员中出现的不明原因肺炎病例（如从事SARS科研、检测、试剂和疫苗生产等相关工作人员），接触野生动物的人员发生的不明原因肺炎病例；4、不明原因的肺炎死亡病例。
According to the National Program for Monitoring Cases of Unknown Causes of Pneumonia (Trial Implementation) issued by the former Ministry of Health in 2004, unidentified pneumonia cases meeting one of the following conditions can be classified as SARS early warning cases.
一位上海市疾控中心防疫科的工作人员告诉八点健闻，“目前对于不明原因肺炎的处置有标准流程，包括发病报告、留学病学调查、密切接触者管理等。
"At present, there is a standard procedure for the handling of unexplained pneumonia, including disease report, study abroad, close contact with the management," a staff member of the epidemic prevention department of Shanghai CDC told Jiangnan Eight.
”另一位业内人士则说，上一次SARS的消失，是因为病毒自我快速变异后，不再对人体构成威胁，如果卷土重来，预案很多。
Another industry source said the last time SARS disappeared was because the virus had mutated so quickly that it no longer posed a threat to humans, and if it made a comeback, there were plans to do so.
查询知网，可以看到很多对不明原因肺炎的检测报告，都没有引起大规模的传播。
Query knowledge net, can see a lot of unidentified causes of pneumonia detection report, did not cause a large-scale spread.

根据武汉卫健委的通报，病毒性肺炎多见于冬春季，可散发或暴发流行，临床主要表现为发热、浑身酸痛、少部分有呼吸困难，肺部浸润影。
According to the Wuhan Health Commission, viral pneumonia, common in winter and spring, can be disseminated or outbreak of epidemic, clinical manifestations of fever, body pain, a small part of breathing difficulties, lung infiltration shadow.
病毒性肺炎与病毒的毒力、感染途径以及宿主的年龄、免疫状态有关。
Viral pneumonia is related to the virulence of the virus, the route of infection, and the age and immune status of the host.
引起病毒性肺炎的病毒以流行性感冒病毒为常见，其他为副流感病毒、巨细胞病毒、腺病毒、鼻病毒、冠状病毒等。
Virus causing viral pneumonia is common to influenza viruses, other sub-influenza viruses, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus and so on.
确诊则有赖于病原学检查，包括病毒分离、血清学检查以及病毒抗原及核酸检测。
Diagnosis is dependent on etiological tests, including virus isolation, serological testing and viral antigen and nucleic acid testing.
该病可防可控，预防上保持室内空气流通，避免到封闭、空气不流通的公众场合和人多集中地方，外出可佩戴口罩。
The disease can be controlled, indoor air circulation can be prevented, closed, airtight public places and crowded places should be avoided, and masks can be worn outside.
临床以对症治疗为主，需卧床休息。
Clinical treatment to symptomatic treatment, need to rest in bed.
如有上述症状，特别是持续发热不退，要及时到医疗机构就诊。
If have afore-mentioned symptom, especially constant febrile does not retreat, want to go to medical institution in time.
