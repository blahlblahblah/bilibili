2014年油价暴跌以来，全球石油行业的日子就不好过。
Since the collapse of oil prices in 2014, the global oil industry has had a difficult time.
2018年发生了价格过山车，2019年相对是个好年份， 2020年看来必须在需求不振和价格疲软的困境中艰难求生图/IC文 | 王能全2019年以来，国际石油市场有一个令人称奇的现象：品质最低的阿曼原油的价格不但高过了WTI原油，更有114个交易日高过了布伦特原油。
With a price rollercoaster in 2018, 2019 is a relatively good year, and 2020 seems to have had to contend with weak demand and weak prices. & # 160; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45
2020年1月，这一现象仍在持续，但是1月31日，阿曼原油的价格首次低于布伦特。
The phenomenon continued in January 2020, but on 31 January Oman crude oil prices were lower than Brent for the first time.
至2月20日的14个交易日中，有9个交易日阿曼原油的价格低于布伦特原油，占交易天数的64.29%。
Omani crude oil prices were lower than Brent crude oil for 9 of the 14 trading days to 20 February, accounting for 64.29 per cent of the trading days.
这是因为从1月底开始，新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情爆发并演变成全球性的公共卫生事件，引发国际石油价格持续走低，并带来了作为远东市场标杆的阿曼原油价格回归正常和理性。
This is because the outbreak of the new coronavirus pneumonia, which began in late January, has become a global public-health event, triggering a sustained decline in international oil prices and bringing back normal and rational prices of Omani crude oil, the benchmark for the Far East market.
其中的关键因素，是中国交通运输用油的大降，导致进口量大降，而以阿曼原油为标杆价格的中东原油，正是中国石油进口的主要来源。
A key factor has been the drop in China's transport oil, which has led to a sharp drop in imports, with Omani crude oil as the benchmark for Middle East oil, the main source of Chinese oil imports.
中国是世界第二大石油消费国，第一大石油进口国，是近年来国际石油市场消费增量的主要来源，2019年世界石油消费增量中的三分之二以上来自于中国。
China is the world's second-largest oil consumer, the largest oil importer, and the main source of the recent increase in consumption in the international oil market, with China accounting for more than two thirds of the increase in world oil consumption in 2019.
2019年，全球石油消费由2018年的9930万桶/天增长到10026万桶/天，每天增加的量为96万桶。
Global oil consumption rose from 99.3 million barrels per day in 2018 to 10.06 million barrels per day in 2019, an increase of 960,000 barrels per day.
同期，中国的石油消费由2018年的1297万桶/天，增长到2019年的1361万桶/天，每天增加64万桶。
Over the same period, China's oil consumption rose from 12.97 million barrels per day in 2018 to 13.61 million barrels per day in 2019, an increase of 640,000 barrels per day.
近年来，中国国内石油产量增长乏力，2019年国内石油产量仅比2018年增加10万桶/天，从而导致2019年中国石油消费增量中的98.97%必须靠进口来补充。
In recent years, China's domestic oil production has been anemic, increasing domestic oil production by only 100,000 bpd in 2019 compared with 2018, resulting in 98.97 per cent of the increase in China's oil consumption having to be supplemented by imports in 2019.
根据欧佩克的统计，2019年，中国平均每天原油进口的数量为1020万桶/天，比2018年增长了90万桶/天。
In 2019, China's average daily oil import bill was 10.2 million barrels a day, up 900,000 barrels a day from 2018, according to OPEC.
交通运输是中国油品消费的大头。
Transportation is the bulk of China's oil consumption.
根据国际能源署的统计，在2019年中国每天消费的1360.7万桶石油产品中，车用汽油为311.2万桶/天，占全部油品消量的22.87%；航空燃料为85.8万桶/天，占比6.31%；柴油为355.3万桶/天，占比26.11%。
According to the International Energy Agency, of the 13.607 million barrels per day of petroleum products consumed by China in 2019, 3.112 million bpd, or 22.87 per cent of the total oil consumption, 858,000 bpd, or 6.31 per cent, for aviation fuel and 26.11 per cent, or 26.11 per cent, for diesel.
三项合计为752.3万桶/天，占到全部油品消费的55.29%。
The three items together accounted for 7.523 million bpd, or 55.29 per cent of total oil consumption.
目前，全世界一次能源消费总量约为140亿吨油当量。
At present, total world primary energy consumption is about 14 billion tons of oil equivalent.
从终端使用情况看，工业行业（包括非燃烧使用）消费了全球能源消费的约一半，其次是建筑行业消费了29%，第三是交通运输消费了21%。
In terms of end-use, the industrial sector (including non-combustion) consumes about half of global energy consumption, followed by the construction sector with 29 per cent and transport with 21 per cent.
在交通运输行业消费的全部能源中，石油所占比重高达94%，是交通运输行业的绝对主导能源来源。
Oil accounts for 94 per cent of the total energy consumed by the transport sector and is the dominant and absolute source of energy for the transport sector.
2003年，由液化石油气、航空燃料、汽油和柴油等构成的运输用燃料，中国占全球的比例为5%，2019年增长到12%。
In 2003, China's share of global fuel for transport, consisting of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), aviation fuel, gasoline and diesel, increased from 5 per cent globally to 12 per cent in 2019.
中国的交通运输的停顿，对全球石油市场的冲击立竿见影。
China's transportation gridlock has had an immediate impact on the global oil market.
机构和专家们对新冠肺炎疫情给全球经济影响基本一致的看法是，由于人员流动受限和生产停滞，带来了全球供应链的混乱，抑制了全球贸易，投资者和消费者信心恶化，短期世界经济增长肯定将放缓。
There is broad agreement among institutions and experts about the global economic impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic, with limited movement of people and stagnant production leading to disruptions in global supply chains, dampening global trade, deteriorating investor and consumer confidence and certainly slowing short-term world economic growth.
作为现代社会的血液，石油消费直接受制于经济活动。
As the blood of modern society, oil consumption is directly subject to economic activities.
新冠肺炎疫情发生后，世界主要能源机构纷纷下调了2020年全球石油消费增长的预期。
In the wake of the outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia, the world's leading energy agencies have lowered their forecasts for global oil consumption growth in 2020.
在2月12日出版的2020年第2期《月度石油市场报告》中，欧佩克认为2020年全球经济增长将下降0.1个百分点，全年增长为3%，全球石油消费增长为99万桶/天，比1月份的估计每天下调了20万桶。
In its second monthly oil market report for 2020, published on February 12, OPEC expects global economic growth to fall by 0.1 percentage point to 3% for the year as a whole, with global oil consumption rising to 990,000 barrels a day, down 200,000 barrels a day from January estimates.
在2月11日出版的2020年第2期《短期能源展望》中，美国能源信息署认为，2020年全球石油消费将比2019年增长100万桶/天，比1月份的预测大幅下调37.8万桶/天。
In its February 11 issue of Short-Term Energy Outlook 2020, the US Energy Information Administration argues that global oil consumption will increase by 1 million barrels per day in 2020 compared to 2019, a significant drop of 378,000 barrels per day from January projections.
最为悲观的是国际能源署。
Most pessimistic is the International Energy Agency.
在其最新出版的2020年2月份《石油市场报告》中，国际能源署认为，2020年全球石油消费仅增长82.5万桶/天，比年初的预测大幅下调36.5万桶/天，是2011年以来最低的增长速度。
In its latest edition of the February 2020 Oil Market Report, the International Energy Agency found that global oil consumption had increased by only 825,000 barrels per day in 2020, a significant drop of 365,000 barrels per day from the forecast made at the beginning of the year, the lowest rate since 2011.
国际能源署认为，2020年第一季度，全球石油消费量年化计算后每天会下降43.5万桶，是10多年来第一次全球性的石油消费下降。
The IEA reckons global oil consumption will decline by 435,000 barrels a day in the first quarter of 2020, the first global decline in oil consumption in more than a decade.
新冠肺炎疫情对中国石油消费的影响最大，下调2020年中国石油消费增长是所有机构的共识。
The New Crown Pneumonia epidemic has had the biggest impact on China's oil consumption, and a reduction in China's oil consumption growth in 2020 is the consensus of all agencies.
欧佩克认为，2019年中国石油消费增长了35万桶/天，2020年预计仅增长23万桶/天，由2019年的增长2.77%下降到2020年仅增长1.74%。
OPEC believes China's oil consumption rose by 350,000 barrels a day in 2019 and is expected to grow by only 230,000 barrels a day in 2020, down from 2.77 per cent in 2019 to only 1.74 per cent in 2020.
美国能源信息署认为，2020年中国石油消费增量将减少19万桶/天，其中第一季度石油消费为1470万桶/天，第二季度为1500万桶/天，分别比年初的预测减少30万桶/天和20万桶/天。
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, China's increase in oil consumption will drop by 190,000 barrels per day in 2020, of which 14.7 million barrels per day in the first quarter and 15 million barrels per day in the second quarter, respectively, 300,000 barrels per day and 200,000 barrels per day less than forecast at the beginning of the year.
2020年第1季度中国的原油加工量将减少110万桶/天，年化计算后为减少50万桶/天。
In the first quarter of 2020, China's crude-oil processing capacity will be reduced by 1.1 million barrels per day, or 0.5 million barrels per day after annualization.
新冠肺炎疫情发生后，由于油品的需求降至冰点，中国炼厂加工负荷大幅度下降，主力炼厂的加工负荷维持在70%左右，部分地方炼厂的加工负荷仅维持在30%，进口原油港口大量压船，中国周边港口已一罐难求，老旧油轮也用于储存原油。
After the outbreak of the New Crown Pneumonia, processing loads at Chinese refineries dropped dramatically as oil demand fell to freezing, processing loads at major refineries remained at around 70 per cent, processing loads at some local refineries remained at only 30 per cent, imported crude oil ports were heavily pressurized, China's neighbouring ports became inaccessible and old tankers were used to store crude oil.
未经证实的消息称，中国已退回5000万桶进口原油。
Unconfirmed reports say China has returned 50 million barrels of imported crude oil.
可以肯定，2020年第1季度，全球石油库存将大幅度增加，第2和第3季度国际石油市场将面临持续的库存消化压力。
To be sure, global oil inventories will increase significantly in the first quarter of 2020, and international oil markets will face continued inventory absorption pressures in the second and third quarters of the year.
2014年价格暴跌以来，持续的供大于求是国际石油市场的常态。
Since the collapse of prices in 2014, persistent oversupply has been the norm in international oil markets.
，欧佩克除自行减产外，还联合俄罗斯等10个世界主要石油生产国共同减产，催生了欧佩克+。
In addition to cutting output on its own, OPEC joined forces with 10 of the world's major oil producers, including Russia, to cut production, creating OPEC +.
不断加码限制石油产量以求稳定国际石油市场，既是欧佩克和俄罗斯等世界主要石油生产国的主要任务，也是近年来国际石油市场的头号新闻。
Increasing restrictions on oil production in an effort to stabilize the international oil market have been a major task for the world's major oil producers, such as OPEC and Russia, and the number one news item on the international oil market in recent years.
目前，全球石油产量超过1亿桶/天，沙特阿拉伯等国手中仍有300万桶/天以上的剩余石油生产能力。
Currently, global oil production exceeds 100 million b / d, and countries such as Saudi Arabia still have more than 3 million barrels per day of remaining oil production capacity.
新冠肺炎疫情发生后，面对需求不振，2月初欧佩克+技术委员会建议每天进一步消减60万桶原油的产量，为此沙特阿拉伯积极推动希望在2月份召开紧急会议讨论增加减产事宜，但由于俄罗斯的反对没有举行。
Saudi Arabia pushed for an emergency meeting in February to discuss increased production cuts in the face of weak demand following the outbreak of the New Crown Pneumonia, for which OPEC + Technical Committee recommended a further reduction of 600,000 barrels per day in early February, but Russian opposition did not take place.
3月初，欧佩克+部长级会议将举行例行会议，讨论减产问题。
In early March, a regular OPEC + ministerial meeting will be held to discuss production cuts.
无论这次会议的结果如何，增大减产幅度以维持国际石油市场稳定，将是沙特阿拉伯、俄罗斯等世界主要石油生产国2020年必须面对的棘手议题。
Regardless of the outcome of the meeting, increasing production cuts to maintain stability in international oil markets will be a thorny issue for the world's major oil producers, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, in 2020.
就在新冠肺炎疫情最为严重的2月6日，国际货币基金组织（IMF）发布了《石油的未来和海湾国家地区的财政可持续性》的报告，其中的两大结论，引起舆论的普遍关注。
On February 6, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the worst outbreak of pneumonia in the Gulf, released its report The Future of Oil and Fiscal Sustainability in the Gulf States Region.
结论之一是，IMF认为，由于人口增长放缓，经济增长对石油依赖减少和长期全球经济增速预计放缓，全球石油需求在2041年左右触顶，日均为1.15亿桶的水平，而且如果能效显著提高或实施碳税，全球石油需求可能在2030年左右达峰。
One conclusion is that the IMF believes that global oil demand will peak around 2041, averaging 115 million barrels per day, as a result of slower population growth, reduced oil dependence on economic growth and an expected slowdown in long-term global economic growth, and that global oil demand could peak around 2030 if energy efficiency is significantly increased or carbon taxes are imposed.
结论之二是，至2018年底海湾国家累积的2万亿美元金融财富，在石油市场将发生重大转变的背景下在15年后耗尽，预计在2034年变为负值，这些国家将成为净借款国且所有的非石油财富也将在随后的十年内耗尽。
Second, the $2 trillion in financial wealth accumulated by the Gulf countries by the end of 2018, exhausted after 15 years in the context of a major shift in the oil market, is expected to become negative in 2034, with these countries becoming net borrowers and all non-oil wealth being depleted in the following decade.
根据国际能源署的统计口径，当前全球的石油消费总量为1.0026亿桶/天，虽然从今天至2041年仍有20年的时间，但今天全球的石油消费总量仅比20年后的峰值少1454万桶/天。
According to the International Energy Agency, current global oil consumption is 100.26 million barrels per day, and, although 20 years from now until 2041, the world's total oil consumption today is only 14.54 million barrels per day lower than its peak 20 years later.
作为偶发事件，新冠肺炎疫情引发的全球石油消费增长放缓虽然是短暂的，但为IMF有关石油消费峰值研究报告，提供了绝佳的注脚。
The slowdown in global oil consumption, triggered by the outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia, while temporary, provides an excellent footnote to the IMF's report on peak oil consumption.
对于石油生产国来说，面对石油出口和收入的突然下降，要思考并采取措施维持本国经济和社会的稳定；对于石油消费国来说，面对消费急剧下降，必须增强自身的应变能力，维持石油化工行业和本国经济的稳定。
For oil-producing countries, the sudden decline in oil exports and revenues required reflection and measures to maintain their economic and social stability; for oil-consuming countries, facing a sharp decline in consumption, it was necessary to strengthen their resilience and maintain the stability of the petrochemical industry and their economies.
2019-2020年冬季很快就将过去，但即将到来的春天和夏天，对于全球石油行业来说可能仍然是冬天。
The winter of 2019-2020 will soon pass, but the coming spring and summer may still be winter for the global oil industry.
严重供过于求情况下，石油价格也将疲软，布伦特原油全年均价应该在65美元/桶以下，并有可能出现低于50美元/桶的低价位。
Oil prices will also weaken in a situation of severe oversupply, with average annual Brent prices below $65 per barrel and possibly below $50 per barrel.
2014年价格暴跌以来，全球石油行业的日子就不好过。
Since the collapse of prices in 2014, the global oil industry has had a difficult time.
2018年发生了价格过山车，2019年相对是一个好年份，虽然有惊有险但最终波澜不惊，油价走出了一个不断上涨的曲线，但2020年看来必须在需求不振和价格疲软的困境中艰难求生。
With the rollercoaster in 2018, 2019 has been a relatively good year, and, while it was a dangerous but ultimately uneventful year, with oil prices emerging from a rising curve, 2020 seems to have to struggle to survive weak demand and weak prices.
