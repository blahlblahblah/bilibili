日本政府针对疫情所有的措施看上去好像慢半拍，但全部是在《传染病法》《检疫法》等现有法律的框架下制定的3月6日，日本东京，行人佩戴口罩在街头行走。
All the measures taken by the Japanese government to deal with the outbreak seem to be slow, but they were all made within the framework of existing laws such as the Infectious Diseases Act and the Quarantine Law.

之后的两个多月里，虽然诊所内从未出现一例确诊病例，但他们一直不曾松懈。
For more than two months thereafter, although there was never a single confirmed case in the clinic, they did not relent.
现在，吉永惠实还在定期拨打一位疑似患者的电话。
At the moment, KY is making regular calls to a suspected patient.
2月4日，这名患者因为咳嗽来到诊所就诊。
On 4 February, the patient came to the clinic with a cough.
经吉永惠实仔细询问，患者道出实情：同一研究室的武汉同学在1月21日回国后已被确诊新冠肺炎，自己属于密切接触者。
Upon his careful inquiry, the patient told the truth: Wuhan students from the same research room had been diagnosed with pneumonia on January 21 and belonged to close contacts.
吉永惠实检查后，发现患者有明显的上呼吸道症状，马上上报了文京区保健所，并开具转诊证明，要求患者到国立传染病研究所进行病毒检测。
After the examination, it was found that the patient had obvious upper respiratory symptoms, immediately reported to the Wenjing District Health Center, and issued a referral certificate, patients to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases for virus testing.
但在次日追访时，患者说并没有去国立传染病研究所。
But in a follow-up interview the next day, the patient said he did not go to the National Institute for Infectious Diseases.
再之后，这位患者的电话就无法接通。
After that, the patient could not be reached.
惠实诊所所在的文京区，位于日本东京都二十三区之中央，被称为“文化教育区”。
Wishi clinic located in the Wenjing District, located in the center of the 23rd District of Tokyo Tokyo, known as the "cultural education area."
包括日本最高学府东京大学的本部校区在内，不少高等学府都汇集于此。
Many institutions of higher learning, including the headquarters of the University of Tokyo, the highest school in Japan, are located there.
在人口约22万人的文京区，像惠实诊所这样的私人诊所共有140多个。
In Wenjing District, with a population of about 220,000, there are more than 140 private clinics, such as the Huishi Clinic.
这些分布广泛但规模普遍较小的诊所，构成了日本防治疫情的第一道关卡。
These clinics, which are widely distributed but generally small in scale, constitute the first level of the epidemic in Japan.
根据东京都传染病信息中心官网的数据，截至3月7日，东京都共确诊新冠患者64例。
As of March 7, 64 new cases had been diagnosed in Tokyo, according to the official network of the TKyoto Infectious Diseases Information Center.
网站公布了所有患者的年龄层、性别、职业、症状、发病日等，但未公布患者的姓名和住址信息。
The website published age, sex, occupation, symptoms, date of onset, etc. for all patients, but did not disclose the patient's name and address.
另据日本政府发布的消息，截至东京时间3月10日上午10时30分，日本国内累计确诊新冠肺炎病例510例，此外有包机归国的确诊病例14例，确诊病例中包括9例死亡病例。
A total of 510 cases of new crown pneumonia had been confirmed in Japan as of 10: 30 a.m. Tokyo time, while 14 confirmed cases, including 9 deaths, had been confirmed by charter flights, according to the government.
按世界卫生组织公布的“每日疫情报告”，“钻石公主”号邮轮疫情属于“国际运输工具”病例，其数字与日本国内分开记载。
According to the Daily Propaganda Report published by the World Health Organization, the number of cases of "Princess Diamond" is recorded separately from that of Japan.
目前，“钻石公主”号邮轮确诊病例为696例。
The number of confirmed cases on board the MV Princess Diamond is 696.
日本厚生劳动省3月10日在给《中国新闻周刊》的书面回复中指出，根据专家们的判断，日本的感染情况目前尚处于“可以控制感染速度”的阶段，同时，“接下来的一两周，将会是决定感染急速扩大抑或得以平息的关键时期。
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare said in a written reply to the China News Weekly on March 10 that experts judged the infection in Japan to be at the "manageable rate" and that "the next week or two will be a critical period for determining whether the infection will spread or subside."
”有鉴于此，日本政府正在尽一切手段全力遏制国内感染进一步扩大。
With this in mind, the Japanese government is doing everything in its power to stem the spread of infection in the country.
从私人诊所开始的“防控体系”位于东京地铁“东大前”站附近的惠实诊所，诊疗项目包括内科、皮肤科、中医、高血压、糖尿病等及部分美容项目，共有7名医护人员，4至5名事务性工作人员。
The prevention and control system, which began in private clinics, is located in Huishi Clinic near the "East University" Station of Tokyo Metro. The program includes internal medicine, dermatology, Chinese medicine, hypertension, diabetes and some cosmetic items, with seven medical staff and four to five clerical staff.
在日本，惠实诊所属于中上规模的综合型私人诊所。
In Japan, the clinic is a medium to large-scale integrated private clinic.
根据世界卫生组织（WHO）下设机构2018年发布的《日本卫生系统评估报告》，截至2016年，日本共有8442家医院、101529家诊所。
According to the 2018 Health System Assessment Report of the World Health Organization (WHO), there are 8,442 hospitals and 101,529 clinics in Japan as of 2016.
另据日本全国医院医疗设施数据库中的数据，东京都共有646家综合医院，12740家诊所。
There are also 646 general hospitals and 12,740 clinics in Tokyo, according to data from the National Hospital Medical Facilities Database of Japan.
日本医院主要分成国立或私立大型综合医院和深入社区的私人诊所。
Japanese hospitals are mainly divided into large state or private general hospitals and private clinics that reach out to the community.
综合医院中，相当一部分不接受直接到院初诊。
A significant proportion of general hospitals do not receive direct first visits to hospitals.
在东京一家风投公司工作的孙克争对《中国新闻周刊》说，平时看病都是就近去诊所，因为日本私人诊所的专业水平是有保障的，并不觉得跟大型公立医院有什么本质的区别。
Sun Kejun, who works for a Tokyo-based venture capital firm, told China News Weekly: 'In normal times, doctors go to clinics close to them, because the level of expertise in private clinics in Japan is guaranteed and doesn't seem to differ substantially from that of large public hospitals.
吉永惠实介绍说，如果碰到要手术住院这类的情况，诊所医生会出具转诊单，将病人转诊到综合医院。
In cases of hospitalization, doctors issue referral forms and refer patients to general hospitals, she said.
综合医院的治疗完成后，会将详细的治疗总结以及需要进行护理的病人再转回诊所。
Upon completion of general hospital treatment, a detailed summary of the treatment and the patient requiring care are referred back to the clinic.
附近的东京大学附属医院、日本医科大学附属医院、顺天堂医院等，都是惠实诊所长期合作的综合医院。
The nearby University of Tokyo Hospital, the Japan Medical University Hospital, Shun Hei Hospital, etc. are all multi-purpose hospitals that Huishi Clinic has been cooperating with for a long time.
“日本的就诊习惯和中国不一样，就诊先得从诊所开始。
"In Japan, unlike in China, you have to start at the clinic first.
”吉永惠实告诉《中国新闻周刊》。
She told China News Weekly.
即便是遇到了疫情，日本民众寻求治疗也能做到秩序井然，这和日本的国情有关系，“良好卫生习惯是基础”。
Even in the face of the epidemic, the Japanese people can seek treatment in an orderly manner, which has to do with the Japanese situation, "good hygiene habits are the foundation."
“日本人平时打了喷嚏或咳嗽都会对周围人说声对不起。
"The Japanese usually sneeze or cough and say sorry to the people around them.
这个季节是流感季节、1月底2月初花粉症又开始，所以很多人就算没有疫情也戴着口罩。
The season is the flu season and hay fever starts again in late January and early February, so many people wear masks even if there is no outbreak.
至于勤洗手，幼儿园小朋友都训练有素。
As for washing hands frequently, kindergarten children are well trained.
举个例子，公立小学午饭时，学生会轮流值班分餐，轮到谁都必须戴好围兜，把头发用大手帕包起来，洗手更不用说了。
For example, at lunchtime in a public elementary school, the students take turns sharing meals. It is everyone's turn to put on their bibs, wrap their hair in large handkerchiefs, not to mention wash their hands.
”复旦大学日本研究中心教授高兰在1月底，曾赴日出差。
Gao Lan, a professor at Fudan University's Japan Research Center, went on a business trip to Japan at the end of January.
据她当时观察，日本民众普遍心态偏向乐观，觉得也就是比流感更严重一些。
At the time, she observed, the general mood in Japan was one of optimism that it was more serious than the flu.
高兰向《中国新闻周刊》分析称，日本的多灾特点在一定程度上造就了日本人处乱不惊的心态。
Goran told China News Weekly that Japan's multi-hazard characteristics to a certain extent contributed to the Japanese attitude of calm.
由于地理原因，日本是个灾害多发的岛国，各大中小学校都有丰富的防灾教育。
Due to geographical reasons, Japan is a disaster-prone island country, schools and universities have a wealth of disaster prevention education.
另一方面也有现实原因，日本民众对政府信息的透明度和拿出方案的可信度，整体还是保持信任。
On the other hand, there is a real reason why the Japanese population as a whole maintains trust in the transparency of government information and the credibility of its programmes.
面对新冠肺炎这样的传染病，诊所医生要先把第一道关。
In the face of an infectious disease like Newcastle Pneumonia, the clinic doctor has to turn the first pass.
惠实诊所周围有不少诊所，除了个别老先生开的小诊所贴了“临时休整”的告示，其他诊所都是有能力接诊发热的疑似病例。
There are many clinics around the clinic, except for "temporary rest" signs in small clinics run by individual elderly men. All other clinics are capable of treating suspected cases of fever.
不过，私人诊所是否愿意接待发热病人“完全是自愿的”。
However, the willingness of private clinics to take in febrile patients is "entirely voluntary."
吉永惠实举例说，如果现在有一个患者发烧，打电话到东大附属医院这样的大医院去，他们是不接诊的，而是会让患者就近找诊所就诊，做第一道检测。
If, for example, a patient has a fever now, call a major hospital like Dongda's Affiliated Hospital. Instead, they will ask the patient to go to the nearest clinic for the first test.
“如果真是有临床疑似症状，如发烧37.5℃以上、有上呼吸道症状4天以上、65岁以上的人有症状2天以上，拍下来的胸片也是很可疑的，那么我就会开具转诊信，到指定机构检测，并向保健所汇报。
"If there is a genuine clinical suspicion, such as a fever of 37.5 degrees Celsius, symptoms of the upper respiratory tract for more than 4 days and people over 65 years of age who have symptoms of more than 2 days, and the taking of chest films is suspicious, I will issue a referral letter to the designated institution for testing and reporting to the clinic.
”吉永惠实的说法，和日本厚生劳动给《中国新闻周刊》的书面回复中关于核酸检测条件的要求完全一致。
Mr Keio's account is fully consistent with the requirements for nucleic acid testing set out in a written response from Japan's MHLW to China News Weekly.
按照2015年出版的《日本卫生应急处置法律反应报告》，医生须通过地方保健所向地方行政长官报告传染性疾病发生情况。
According to the Japan Health Emergency Response Report published in 2015, doctors are required to report the occurrence of infectious diseases to the local administrator through local health clinics.
《报告》指出，发生公共卫生危机时，日本各级地方政府的保健所在地方卫生管理中处于中心地位。
The Report notes that, in times of public health crisis, local government health clinics at all levels in Japan are at the centre of local health management.
遇上传染病流行时，保健所能够协调医疗服务提供者、医学研究者、药剂师协会等社会资源。
In the event of an epidemic, the clinic is able to coordinate social resources such as health-care providers, medical researchers, pharmacists' associations, etc.
到2014年4月时，日本全国各地已建立了大约500个保健所。
By April 2014, some 500 health posts had been established throughout Japan.
东京的23区，每个区都有一家保健所。
In the 23rd district of Tokyo, there is a health clinic in each district.
3月2日，在日本名古屋的一所高中，学生们戴着口罩参加毕业典礼。
Students wear masks at a graduation ceremony at a high school in Nagoya, Japan, on March 2.
2月17日，由于新冠疫情进一步蔓延，日本厚生劳动省要求出现疑似症状的人员，需在就诊前向设在全国各地保健所内的“回国者· 接触者咨询中心”进行咨询。
On 17 February, as a result of the further spread of the new crown epidemic, the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Labour requested that persons with suspected symptoms be referred to the "Returnees and Contacts Counselling Centres" located in health clinics throughout the country prior to consultation.
老年人、有糖尿病等基础疾病者，如果症状持续2天左右就应进行咨询。
The elderly, people with basic diseases such as diabetes, if the symptoms continue for about 2 days should be consulted.
据共同社报道，要求出现症状者在就诊前先行向保健所咨询，是旨在防止轻症患者涌入医疗机构导致诊疗功能受损，同时也是为了尽早发现和收治重症患者。
According to Kyodo, the requirement for symptomatic patients to consult a health clinic before seeking treatment is aimed at preventing the influx of light patients into medical institutions leading to impaired diagnostic functions, but also at the early detection and treatment of serious patients.
但在电话咨询后，患者会被要求就近找诊所就诊。
But after a phone call, the patient is asked to go to the nearest clinic.
吉永惠实介绍，一旦有疑似患者的核酸检验结果为阳性，将由初诊机构开具转诊单，送入有能力接收新冠患者的指定医院。
If a suspected patient has a positive nucleic acid test, a referral form will be drawn up by the initial clinic and sent to a designated hospital capable of receiving patients with the new crown, according to Ky.
在文京区，接治新冠患者的指定医院为东京都立驹込病院。
In Wenjing District, the designated hospital for new crown patients is TMA Colony Hospital.
该医院擅长治疗癌症和传染病，有悠久的历史，在1879年设立之初，就曾作为霍乱病的隔离医院。
The hospital has a long history of treating cancer and infectious diseases and was used as a quarantined hospital for cholera from its inception in 1879.
慢半拍是“正确的合适的”随着疫情蔓延，2月25日，日本公布了应对新冠肺炎疫情的基本方针，作为日本今后一段时间防控工作的指导文件。
Slow half-patting is "right and proper" As the epidemic spreads, Japan announced on February 25 its basic guidelines for dealing with the outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia as a guiding document for its prevention and control efforts for some time to come.
这套方针以“尽可能控制感染扩散速度、尽可能减少重症和死亡病例”为目标，原则上要求轻症患者居家静养，减少对密切接触者健康观察，整理并完善以重症者为中心的医疗资源和体系。
Aimed at "minimizing the spread of infection and minimizing serious and fatal cases," the guidelines require, in principle, home-based rest for patients with mild illness, reduced health observation of close contacts, and consolidation and improvement of medical resources and systems centred on the seriously ill.
对于日本这项应对疫情的新政策，美国约翰·霍普金斯大学卫生安全中心副主任、传染病和流行病预防知名专家安妮塔·西塞罗在接受《中国新闻周刊》采访时认为，日本所采取的措施是“正确的”“合适的”。
Anita Cicero, deputy director of the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health and Safety and a leading expert on infectious disease and epidemic prevention, told China News Weekly that the Japanese measures were "right" and "appropriate."
不过，日本出现疫情后，安倍政府也在国内面临巨大压力，被认为“在危机管理和经济方面面临重大问题”。
However, in the wake of the Japanese epidemic, Abe's government has also come under intense domestic pressure to be seen as "facing major problems in crisis management and the economy."
特别是停泊在日本横滨港的“钻石公主号”邮轮发生了大规模感染，让安倍遭遇反对党的激烈批评，安倍的民调支持率也大幅下降。
In particular, Abe's poll ratings have plummeted following a massive infection of the MV Princess Diamond, which docked in Yokohama, Japan, which came under intense criticism from the opposition.
中国现代国际关系研究院研究员刘军红对《中国新闻周刊》说，日本政府针对疫情所有的措施看上去好像慢半拍，但全部是在《传染病法》《检疫法》等现有法律的框架下制定的。
Liu Junhong, a researcher at the China Institute of Modern International Relations, told China News Weekly that all measures taken by the Japanese government to deal with the outbreak appear to be slow, but all have been enacted within the framework of existing laws such as the Infectious Diseases Act and the Quarantine Law.
1 月 27 日，应对疫情方案的“问答专页”在日本厚生劳动省官网公开。
On January 27, the "question and answer page" of the program was made public on the official website of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.
1月28日，依据《传染病法》，日本政府将新型冠状病毒的传染病认定为“指定传染病”。
On January 28, according to the Infectious Diseases Act, the Japanese government designated the infectious diseases of the new coronavirus as "designated infectious diseases."
这部从1999年开始实施的《传染病法》（全称为《传染病预防与对传染病患者医疗法》），为日本应对由传染病引起的潜在健康危机提供了法律依据。
This Law on Infectious Diseases (fully known as the Law on the Prevention of Infectious Diseases and the Medical Treatment of Patients with Infectious Diseases), which has been in force since 1999, provides the legal basis for Japan to respond to potential health crises caused by infectious diseases.
吉永惠实在接受《中国新闻周刊》采访时多次提到《传染病法》，称这是日本每一个医务工作者都熟知的法律。
In an interview with China News Weekly, Ji Yonghui repeatedly referred to the Infectious Diseases Act as a law known to every medical worker in Japan.
吉永惠实还记得，在医学院参加资格考试时，《传染病法》是必考内容，且不仅是医学生，对于针灸师、按摩师、护士、检验学等学科的学生，也都一样。
She also recalls that the Infectious Diseases Act was a mandatory part of the qualifying examinations for medical schools, and not only for medical students, but also for students in the fields of acupuncture, masseuse, nursing, examination and so on.
过去几年，日本遭遇过大流行的传染病主要是冬季流感。
Over the past few years, Japan has experienced major epidemics of infectious diseases, mainly winter influenza.
在《传染病法》中，冬季流感属于级别最低的第五类传染病。
Winter influenza is the fifth lowest category of infectious disease in the Communicable Diseases Act.
17年前发生过的SARS以及2012年开始在中东和韩国流行的MERS都属于第二类传染病，但日本并无病例。
SARS, which occurred 17 years ago, and MERS, which began in the Middle East and South Korea in 2012, are in the second category, but there have been no cases in Japan.
《传染病法》还明确规定，当医生作出诊断或怀疑出现第一类至四类传染病或“新传染病”症状时，必须立即向所在地区的保健所上报。
The Communicable Diseases Act also specifies that when a doctor makes a diagnosis or suspects the emergence of a first to four types of infectious disease or "new infectious disease" symptoms, he must immediately report them to the health clinic in the area concerned.
不过，在应对新冠肺炎疫情的基本方针中，无论是居家隔离还是有症状者戴口罩，用词都只是“呼吁”“要求”。
But, in the basic approach to dealing with the outbreak of pneumonia in the home, whether isolated or symptomatic people wearing masks, the words are simply "call" and "demand."
在日本厚生劳动省发布新政策后，日本首相安倍也提出，要求人们在家办公、错峰上班、中小学放假等。
Japan's prime minister, Abe, has also called for people to work from home, stagger to work and take vacations at primary and secondary schools, following a new policy by Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.
高兰向《中国新闻周刊》解释称，安倍、厚生劳动省在提出上述要求时用的词是“拜托”“希望”，一方面因为日本是小政府大社会，政府功能相对小，各个地方政治体相对独立，地方政府有权决定地方上的不涉及到国家安全的所有重大事项；另一方面也跟日本的行政体制有关，例如各个地方对学校的管理方式都不同，有些学校归省政府管理，有些归区政府管理，公立学校和私立学校的管理又要分开，非常复杂。
He explained to China News Weekly that Abe, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare used the word "please" and "hope" in making the request, partly because Japan has a small government, relatively small government functions, and local political institutions are relatively independent.
3月5日，日本政府召开第17次新型冠状病毒传染病对策本部会议。
On March 5, the Japanese government held the 17th General Meeting of the Coronavirus Infectious Diseases.
随后公布了最新措施：日本政府将在3月9日0点起至3月底暂停日本驻中韩两国使馆已发放的一次及多次签证的效力，要求从中韩入境日本的人员隔离两周，且避免在日本国内使用公共交通设施。
The latest measures were announced: the Japanese government will suspend the validity of one or more visas issued by Japanese embassies in China and South Korea from 0 p.m. on March 9 until the end of March, demanding that people entering Japan from China be isolated for two weeks and avoiding the use of public transport facilities inside Japan.
3月7日0时起，近期曾在韩国、伊朗部分地区有过旅行史的外国人被日本政府列入“拒绝入境”的名单，期限另行决定。
Since 0000 on March 7, foreigners with recent travel histories in South Korea and parts of Iran have been added to the Japanese government's "no-entry" list for a different period of time.
第二天，日本厚生劳动大臣加藤胜信解释称，要求来自中韩两国的入境者隔离的举措，不是依据《检疫法》或《传染病法》的措施，“说到底是要求”，不具有强制力。
The next day, Japan's Health Minister Shinzo Kato explained that the move to separate immigrants from China and South Korea was not a measure under the Quarantine Act or the Infectious Diseases Act, "in the final analysis a requirement," and was not mandatory.
3月10日，厚生劳动省还在给《中国新闻周刊》的书面回复中指出，为最大程度减少疫情对国民生活的影响，并考虑到事态会发展到需要发布紧急事态宣言那样的情况，日本政府正在加速制定立法措施，以便实施包括发布紧急事态宣言在内的类似于《新型流感等对策特别措施法》的相关措施。
On March 10, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare also pointed out in a written response to China News Weekly that in order to minimize the impact of the epidemic on national life and considering that the situation would develop to the extent that an emergency declaration was required, the Government of Japan was speeding up legislative measures to implement measures similar to the New Influenza Countermeasures Act, including issuing emergency declarations.
