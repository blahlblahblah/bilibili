First Financial Secretary Shao Haipeng & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
这背后，是河南应对疫情的一系列“优秀”举措——近日新增130所定点医院、525家医院开设发热门诊、全面排查武汉甚至外来人口、交通要塞测体温、地铁小区消毒、暂停娱乐设施、电视直播、app短信推送、公众号推送、广播循环播放、信息轮番轰炸……据网友爆料，在河南洛阳偃师某村从武汉打工回来的阿姨遭到全村人的叮嘱，千万不要出门。

Feel it: In addition, there are plenty of "hard core" posters.
在这样的“硬核”防疫宣传工作下，甚至有网友的姥爷不让他回家了……只肯“空投”！Play第一财经记者注意到，河南新密市的一个村镇群里也发起了群通知——“乡亲们大家好！接上级紧急通知，今天是正月初二，请大家高度重视，都不要走亲串友，更不能让外人来我们村走亲戚，避免病毒交叉感染。
In such a "hard core" epidemic prevention work, even some netizens grandpa refused to let him go home... only "airdrop"! A group of villages and towns in Xinmi City, Henan launched a group notice - "Hello everyone!
望乡亲们相互转告。
The villagers told each other.

While a group notice was posted inside the group, the village chief warned that after 10 o'clock the village would completely block all access roads, and Xinmi, which belongs to Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan Province, is a county-level city under its jurisdiction.
1月26日，天气灰蒙蒙的，空中飘零着雪花。

On this day, the provincial government of Henan issued the Notice on Strengthening the Prevention and Control of Pneumonia from New Coronavirus Infections, which calls for the strengthening of social management, the reduction of mass gatherings and the immediate cessation of public gatherings where there is a clear risk of cross-infection.
通知提到，“城乡基层组织要充分发挥大数据作用，精准管理来自武汉市等疫情发生地区的人员。
"Grass-roots organizations in urban and rural areas should give full play to big data and accurately manage personnel from areas affected by Wuhan and other epidemics," the notice said.
”记者也观察到，对于本地村民外出务工经商等去向，基层组织均做了严密统计，前些天有人从湖北荆门开车回家，后来失联，地方政府还专门发动群众积极找寻，就是为了进行健康登记，督促其居家或隔离医学观察14天，防止疫情输入。
"The reporter also observed that for local villagers to go out to work, such as business, grass-roots organizations have done a rigorous statistics, the last few days from Hubei Jingmen drove home, and later lost contact, the local government also launched a special mass actively search for health registration, urged their homes or quarantine medical observation for 14 days to prevent the importation of epidemic diseases.

记者注意到，尽管会有不方便，村民们却鲜有微辞，对政府所采取的这些措施表示认同。
Reporters noted that despite the inconvenience, villagers rarely complained about the measures taken by the government.
村长也一直在群里提醒，解决疫情最快，成本最低的方式就是在家隔离两周，这样对经济影响最小，对生命健康最有利。

"Honesty at home is the greatest contribution to society.
”不止是基层，河南各城市的防疫宣传工作也是十分有效。

Red Star News commented that some "measures" including text messages from operators in the past few days, as well as publicity about the outbreak in some villages, have even dissuaded those returning from Wuhan from "returning."

很多老年人不能熟练使用微信，不会注意到社交媒体的刷屏，但却会认真对待官方群发的短信提醒。
Many older people are not adept at using micromail and aren't aware of social media scans, but take official text messages seriously.
防控疫情，政府需要把行之有效的措施（戴口罩、洗手）传达到每一个人那里。
To prevent and control the epidemic, the government needs to take effective measures (wearing masks, washing hands) to everyone there.
评论称，相比于北上广这样的大城市，河南有数量庞大的农村人口和回乡过年人员，能在这么短时间动员到基层，说明已经有了相对比较立体的防疫体系。
Compared with such a big city in the north, Henan has a large number of rural population and people returning to the countryside to celebrate the Spring Festival, the commentary said, indicating that a relatively three-dimensional epidemic prevention system was in place.
