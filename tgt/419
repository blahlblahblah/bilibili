27.01.2020本文字数：3361，阅读时长大约6分钟导读：自1月6日开始到17日，武汉新冠肺炎12天未报告一例新增病例，并在较长时间内一直强调“未发现明确的人传人的证据”，在相当程度上导致社会各界缺乏警惕、疏于防护。
From January 6 to January 17, no new cases were reported in Wuhan Xinguan Pneumonia for 12 days, and for a long time emphasis was placed on the "absence of clear evidence of human-to-human transmission," which led to a considerable degree of vigilance and neglect in the community.
作者 | 第一财经 陈益刊 马晓华从12月8日武汉首例新冠（新型冠状病毒感染）肺炎患者发病，到如今近两千人确诊染病（截至1月25日），全国30个省启动重大突发公告卫生事件一级响应，亿万老百姓受此影响。
As of January 25, nearly 2,000 people have been diagnosed with pneumonia, the first new coronavirus infection in Wuhan since December 8. As of January 25, 30 provinces across the country have launched a major public health emergency response, affecting hundreds of millions of people.
究竟什么原因导致疫情蔓延？新冠肺炎始于武汉，而在今年1月20日之前，外界获得疫情进展信息的最主要渠道是武汉市卫生健康委员会网站公布的情况通报。
What caused the outbreak to spread? The outbreak began in Wuhan, and before January 20, the main source of information on the disease's progress was an information bulletin posted on the Wuhan Health and Health Commission's website.
第一财经记者梳理了所有通报发现：12月31日武汉卫健委首次披露27个确诊肺炎病例，随后几天逐步增至59例。
The first financial reporter combed all the notices and found that on December 31, Wuhan Health and Wellness Commission first disclosed 27 confirmed cases of pneumonia, then gradually increased to 59 cases in the next few days.
但自1月6日开始到17日的几次通报中，病例再无增加，且确诊病例从59例降至41例。
However, between 6 January and 17 January, there was no increase in the number of cases, and the number of confirmed cases fell from 59 to 41.
直到1月18日的通报才显示，1月16日的确诊病例小幅增加，其后几天开始大幅增加至572例（截至1月24日），其中死亡38例。
It was not until the briefing on 18 January that there was a small increase in confirmed cases on 16 January, followed by a significant increase to 572 cases (as at 24 January) in the following days, with 38 deaths.
这一数字还在不断上升。
This number is still rising.
除此之外，在12月31日、1月3日、5日、11日的四则通报中，武汉市卫健委明确告诉公众“未发现明确的人传人证据，未发现医务人员感染”。
Besides, in four circulars dated December 31, January 3, 5 and 11, Wuhan city health committee told the public "no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission, no medical personnel found infection."
随后直至1月20日之前的通报中，又称“密切接触者中，没有发现相关病例”。
Later, until January 20 in the circular, also known as "close contacts, no relevant cases were found."
一直到1月20日晚，国家卫健委高级别专家组组长钟南山院士接受媒体采访时表示，新型冠状病毒出现人传人现象，一些医务人员也被感染。
Until the evening of January 20, the high-level expert group leader Zhong Nan Shan Academician, said in an interview with the media, the new coronavirus human-to-human transmission, and some medical personnel were also infected.
武汉新冠肺炎12天未报告一例新增病例，并在较长时间内一直强调“未发现明确的人传人的证据”，在相当程度上导致社会各界缺乏警惕、疏于防护。
Wuhan Xinguan Pneumonia 12 days did not report a new case, and for a long time has stressed that "no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission", to a considerable extent led to a lack of vigilance and neglect of the community.
而在这12天时间里，武汉市和湖北省的两会相继召开。
In this 12-day period, Wuhan and Hubei provinces held the two conferences one after the other.
1月6日至10日，武汉市召开两会。
From January 6 to 10, Wuhan held two conferences.
1月11日至17日，湖北省召开两会。
From January 11 to 17, two conferences were held in Hubei province.
事实上不少医院也向武汉市卫健委反映，医院将疑似患者标本送检后，为何几天都没有结果，从而影响确诊？对此，23日武汉市卫健委答复称，前期对疑似病例的样本检测流程是这样的：首诊医院通过规范的预检分诊、结合临床检查、实验室检查和胸部影像检查，经专家组会诊后确认疑似病例并采样，由辖区疾控中心将样本转运到市疾控中心，市疾控中心转运到省疾控中心进行核酸检测，每天可检测样本200多份。
As a matter of fact, many hospitals also reported to Wuhan city health committee, the hospital will be suspected patient samples sent to check-up, why the results of a few days have no results?
预计从采样开始到结果返回，约需要2天左右的时间。
It is expected to take about two days from the beginning of the sampling to the return of the results.
答复同时称，1月16日之前，湖北省没有试剂盒，还需要送到国家指定的检测机构进行病毒分离和核酸检测，结果返回约需要3—5天。
The response also states that, until January 16, Hubei Province did not have test kits and had to be sent to a state-designated testing facility for virus isolation and nucleic acid testing, resulting in a return of about three to five days.
武汉市卫健委称，为适应当前防控形势需要，提高检测速度，经请示上级有关部门同意，从1月22日开始，武汉市已指定各定点救治医院、发热定点诊疗医院的对口帮扶医院以及市疾控中心等具备相应防护级别的生物安全实验室开展相关样本的病原核酸检测工作，预计全部运行起来每天可检测样本近2000份。
Since January 22, Wuhan has designated designated treatment hospitals, corresponding hospitals for fever diagnosis and treatment, and biosafety laboratories with corresponding protection levels, such as the city's CDC, to carry out pathogen nucleic acid testing of relevant samples, all of which are expected to be ready to test nearly 2,000 samples per day.
专业的回答却无法解释为何连续12天无新增肺炎病例。
Professional answers did not explain why there were no new cases of pneumonia for 12 consecutive days.
毕竟从去年12月31日至1月5日几天时间里，尽管也是前期送检流程，确诊病例从27例增至59例。
After all, from December 31 to January 5 last year, the number of confirmed cases rose from 27 to 59, despite being a pre-screening process.
第一财经记者了解到，当时虽然没有诊断试剂，但是实验室核酸检测可以确诊病例。
The first financial reporter learned that although there was no diagnostic reagent, but laboratory nucleic acid testing can confirm the case.
据病毒学专家介绍，一般需48小时。
According to virologists, it usually takes 48 hours.
武汉市卫健委去年12月31日首次告诉公众，“初步调查表明，未发现明确的人传人证据，未发现医务人员感染。
"Preliminary investigations have shown no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission and no cases of infection by medical personnel," Wuhan Health Commission told the public for the first time on December 31.
”这一口径一直保持到1月14日。
The caliber stayed the same until January 14.
事实上第一财经记者12月31日在武汉华南海鲜市场采访时得知，就有一对夫妻感染新冠肺炎，其中只有丈夫在华南海鲜市场工作。
In fact, the first financial reporter was told in an interview at Wuhan South China Seafood Market on December 31 that only the husband works in the South China Seafood Market.
1月14日在一则新冠肺炎知识问答中，武汉市卫健委称，现有的调查结果表明，尚未发现明确的人传人证据，不能排除有限人传人的可能，但持续人传人的风险较低。
In a quiz on knowledge of pneumonia on January 14, Wuhan city health committee said the existing survey results showed that no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission could not be ruled out, but the risk of continued human-to-human transmission was low.
且目前确诊的41例病例中，发现一起为家庭聚集性，夫妻两人发病，丈夫先发病，为华南海鲜批发市场从业人员，妻子否认有华南海鲜批发市场暴露史。
Among the 41 cases diagnosed so far, one case was found to be familial aggregation. The husband was the first to suffer from the disease and the wife denied any history of exposure at the South China Wholesale Seafood Market.
自此之后直至1月20日，武汉市卫健委通报中不再提及“未发现明确的人传人证据，未发现医务人员感染。
Since then until January 20, Wuhan City Health Commission circular no longer mentioned "no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission, no medical staff found infection.
”，取而代之的是对肺炎患者“密切接触者中，没有发现相关病例”。
In its place, pneumonia patients were "in close contact with no related cases found."
这也传递出人传人可能性很低的信息。
It also conveys the message that human-to-human transmission is very low.
23日武汉市卫健委答问中称，截至1月22日密切接触者出现发热异常症状者46人，排除人数10人，待排人数35人，疑似病例1人。
23 Wuhan city health committee replied that as of January 22, close contacts of the fever symptoms of 46 people, excluding the number of 10, waiting list 35, a suspected case of one.

根据近期的临床资料来看，病毒的传播力似乎有所增强，病毒的毒性和致病力还需要依据更多临床资料进行分析。
