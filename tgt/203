作者 | 王卓铭  编辑 | 张庆宁出品|棱镜·腾讯小满工作室欢迎下载腾讯新闻APP，阅读更多优质资讯1月31日21:00，湖北省新型肺炎防控指挥部召开第九场新闻发布会。
Welcome to download Tencent News APP and read more quality information. At 2100 hours on 31 January, Hubei Province's New Pneumonia New Command held its ninth press conference.
武汉市委副书记、市长周先旺表示：“到目前，武汉仍存在口罩、酒精、消毒液等供给不足的结构性矛盾。
"Wuhan still suffers from structural problems such as insufficient supply of masks, alcohol and disinfectant," said Zhou Xianwang, deputy secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee.
”在新闻发布会召开前的5个小时，武汉协和医院、武汉两家民营医院与负责接受捐赠物资的武汉市红十字会，因口罩分配争执不下。
In the five hours before the news conference, Wuhan Hsiao Wo Hospital, two private hospitals in Wuhan and the Wuhan Red Cross, which is responsible for receiving donations, were locked in a dispute over the distribution of face masks.
1月30日15:00，武汉协和医院发布公告，防护物资再次告急，而且是“快没有了”。
January 30 at 15: 00, Wuhan Concorde Hospital issued a proclamation, the protection material is once again urgent, and is "running out of."
不仅医院缺少口罩，国内多数地区都“一罩难求”。
Not only the lack of hospital masks, most areas of the country are "difficult to access."
在此次疫情之前，中国的口罩日产能可达2000万只，系世界最大的口罩生产国与出口国，年产量占到全球的50%。
Before the outbreak, China had a capacity of 20 million masks a day, making it the world's largest producer and exporter of masks, accounting for 50% of global annual production.
全国近千家口罩企业竞争惨烈，一只口罩赚不到五厘钱。
Nearly a thousand mask companies across the country compete fiercely, a mask earning less than five centimeters.
随着现今需求暴涨，行业形势突变，口罩生产商、上游熔喷布原料商、再上游的聚丙烯等化工品制造商共同复苏。
With demand soaring today, the industry has changed dramatically, with manufacturers of masks, upstream fueljet feedstocks, and chemicals such as polypropylene upstream recovering.
非典迄今17年，这个产业链几经沉浮。
SARS so far 17 years, the industrial chain has repeatedly ups and downs.
国内年产口罩45亿只中国到底缺不缺口罩？十几天之前，这几乎是一个不用思考就能回答的问题，情势在1月20日晚上急转直下。
Ten days ago, it was almost an unthinkable question, and the situation plunged on the night of Jan. 20.
武汉新增病例从1月18日开始增多，20日北京、广东两地出现确诊病例。
Wuhan from January 18 began to increase the number of new cases, 20 Beijing, Guangdong two places appeared confirmed cases.
钟南山在当晚央视连线采访中第一个喊出：“目前资料显示，它（新型冠状病毒）是肯定有人传人的。
Zhong Nan Shan was the first person to yell out in a CCTV interview that night: "The data so far indicate that it is certain to be someone-to-person.
”阻断病毒人际传播的最好方法之一是佩戴口罩。
One of the best ways to block human-to-human transmission of the virus is wearing a mask.
“口罩”两字，注定成为这代人最深刻的春节记忆。
"Mask" two words, destined to become the generation of the most profound memories of the Spring Festival.
很多人从除夕开始到大年初七，没能抢购到一只。
Many people from New Year's Eve to the beginning of the seventh, did not rush to buy a.
此次疫情出现之前，中国本不缺少口罩。
Before the outbreak, China did not lack face masks.
FT中文网援引行业报告相关数据显示，2018年中国口罩行业总产量45.4亿只。
The company cited industry reports showing that the total output of China's mask industry in 2018 was 4.54 billion.
这一数据与工信部发布的口罩行业日产能基本吻合。
This data and the Ministry of Industry and Communications issued by the daily production capacity of the mask industry.
1月29日，中央纪委国家监委网站发布文章，“工信部有关司局负责同志介绍：中国是世界最大的口罩生产和出口国，年产量占全球约50%。
"China is the world's largest producer and exporter of face masks, accounting for about 50 percent of the world's annual output," said the relevant bureau chief of the Ministry of Industry and Communications.
我国口罩最大产能是每天2000多万只。
Our maximum mask production capacity is more than 20 million per day.
”作为普通防护用品，国内大量企业能够生产口罩，近年来市场供应平稳，大量产能供给出口，国内需求占比不高。
A large number of domestic companies are able to produce masks as general protective equipment, and the market has been stable in recent years, supplying large quantities of capacity for export and accounting for only a small share of domestic demand.
2016年，中国纺织品商业协会有过统计，中国各类防护口罩年需求量在8亿只左右，按口罩用途分工业防护、医用卫生和民用三大类，其中民用口罩年需求量在2亿只左右。
In 2016, the China Textile Commercial Association counted the annual demand for various types of respirators at around 800 million, divided into three categories: industrial protection, medical hygiene and civil use according to the use of masks, of which the annual demand for civilian masks is about 200 million.
此次疫情到来之后，即便中国口罩日产能最大可达2000万只，但只相当于全国总人口数的七十分之一。
Even with a maximum capacity of 20 million masks a day, the epidemic is equivalent to only 70% of the country's population.
14亿人的购买力，能使任何商品瞬间紧俏。
The purchasing power of 1.4 billion people can make any good instantaneous.
而且，大部分医用一次性口罩需要每四个小时更换一只。
Moreover, most medical disposable masks need to be replaced every four hours.
在武汉抗疫前线，口罩消耗速度远甚于国内其他地区。
At the front line of the epidemic in Wuhan, masks are consumed much faster than in other parts of the country.
疫情一天不去，口罩一天不可少。
One day the epidemic does not go, a mask is indispensable.
春节期间，大量口罩企业停工停产。
During Spring Festival, a large number of mask enterprises shut down production.
1月23日，工信部部长苗圩在天津调研口罩企业生产情况时表示：“现在很多企业加班加点生产，产量目前恢复到一天800万只以上”。
On January 23, Miao Wei Minister of Industry and Communications studied the production situation of mask enterprises in Tianjin. "Now many enterprises are working overtime, and the output is returning to more than 8 million a day."
这距离2000多万只的峰值产能还有一定差距。
This is more than 20 million peak production capacity is still a certain gap.
各家企业还有一部分存货或在途货物。
Businesses also have some goods in stock or in transit.
1月27日，一家名叫稳健医疗的上市公司宣布，近一个月内已向全国发货1.089亿只口罩。
On January 27, a publicly traded company, Robust Medical, announced it had shipped 108.9 million masks nationwide within a month.
知情人士告诉我们，稳健医疗在除夕夜紧急要求销售人员联系海外采购商，延迟发货，将订单口罩追回，大量销往国内。
People familiar with the matter told us that on New Year's Eve Steady Medical urgently required sales staff to contact overseas buyers, delay delivery, recover the order masks and sell them to China in large quantities.
另一家全国产量靠前的口罩生产商山东三奇医保同样如此，紧急停掉外贸订单，将240万只口罩、7万余套防护服、2.8万个防护面罩送往武汉。
The same is true of Shandong Sanqi, another national producer of high-volume masks, which urgently suspended foreign trade orders and sent 2.4 million masks, more than 70,000 suits and 28,000 face masks to Wuhan.
海外援助和紧急采购同样有很大一部分供给国内。
A large share of overseas aid and emergency procurement is also provided domestically.
1月31日，海关总署发布数据显示，1月24日至30日，我国供进口疫情防控物资价值2.9亿元，其中口罩5622.8万个。
On January 31, the General Administration of Customs released data showing that from January 24 to 30, China imported 290 million yuan worth of epidemic prevention and control materials, including 56.228 million masks.
剩余需求缺口则要依靠产量增加，剩余企业尽快重启生产，上下游产业链协同作战。
The remaining demand gap depends on increased production, the remaining enterprises to restart production as soon as possible, upstream and downstream industrial chain coordination.
拟破产企业恢复生产口罩需求其实是分层次的。
The demand for the resumption of mask production by a bankrupt enterprise is actually hierarchical.
1月31日，国家卫健委疾病预防控制局发布《关于印发新型冠状病毒感染不同风险人群防护指南和预防新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎口罩使用指南的通知》，正式为各种口罩的应用场景做了区分。
On January 31, the CDC's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau issued the Notice on the Guidelines for the Protection of People at Different Risk of New Coronavirus Infection and the Guidance on the Use of Pneumonia Masks for the Prevention of New Coronavirus Infection.
《通知》中指出，KN95/N95及以上颗粒物防护口罩，防护效果优于医用外科口罩、一次性医用口罩，推荐现场调查、采样和检测人员使用。
The notice states that the protection effect of the KN95 / N95 and above particle respirator is superior to that of medical surgical masks and disposable medical masks, and that on-site investigation, sampling and testing personnel are recommended.
公众在人员高度密集场所或密闭公共场所也可佩戴。
The public may also wear them in highly populated areas or closed public places.
KN95是执行GB2626-2006的防护口罩，N95则是符合美国国家疾控中心职业安全卫生研究所（NOISH）标准的口罩，两者过滤颗粒物的等级都在95%以上。
KN95 is a respirator that performs GB2626-2006, and N95 is a mask that meets the National CDC Occupational Safety and Health Institute (NOISH) standard, both of which filter particles above 95%.
除此之外，各大医院也急需符合GB19083-2010的医用防护口罩，对于非密集接触的医护人员和普通公众，这一级别的口罩就够用了。
In addition, major hospitals are in urgent need of GB19083-2010 medical masks, which are sufficient for non-intensive medical personnel and the general public.
由于信息收集渠道的限制，工信部暂未统计到各级别口罩生产企业数量。
Due to limited information collection channels, the Ministry of Industry and Communications has not counted the number of mask production enterprises at all levels.
环球网则称，国内工商注册信息中经营范围包括“口罩、呼吸防护”的企业共有16625家。
The World Wide Web says 16,625 companies have included respirators and respirators as part of their business information.
但N95口罩，由于需取得美国认证，因此俱备生产资质的企业较少。
But N95 masks, which require U. S. certification, are less likely to qualify for production.
NOISH官网上列出了所有通过认证的口罩生产商及获批型号，粗略查询可发现：湖北仙桃、山东青岛、日照、江苏苏州、广东四会、上海等省市分布着众多N95口罩生产企业。
NOISH officials online listed all the approved mask manufacturers and approved types, a cursory inspection can be found: Hubei Xiantao, Shandong Qingdao, Rizhao, Jiangsu Suzhou, Guangdong Association, Shanghai and many other provinces and cities N95 mask production enterprises.
绝大部分企业只能生产医用口罩和普通口罩。
The vast majority of enterprises can only produce medical masks and common masks.
例如河南长垣，中国卫生材料之都。
Henan Changyuan, for example, is the capital of Chinese sanitary materials.
在上世纪七十年代中期，该地从制作棉签、棉球起步，逐渐形成低值医用耗材的产业聚集区。
In the mid-1970s, the region began to produce cotton swab and cotton ball, gradually forming low-value medical consumables industry agglomeration.
医用口罩、垫单、防护服等都属于一次性防护用品，价格不高，医院统一归入低值耗材序列。
Medical masks, gaskets, protective clothing and other disposable protective supplies, prices are not high, the hospital unified into low-value consumption series.
与价格较高的药品和植入式器械相比，低值耗材不引人注意，此前多由医院自行采购。
Compared with more expensive drugs and implantable devices, low-value consumables were less visible and had previously been procured by hospitals themselves.
2018年开始，全国范围才有将低值耗材纳入省级集中采购的趋势，厂商同样面临招标方砍价压力。
Beginning in 2018, there was a nationwide trend to include low-value consumables in centralized provincial procurement, and vendors were also under pressure to negotiate with bidders.
更多的是那些民用的普通口罩，需要企业进入市场消化。
More is the common mask of those civilian use, need the enterprise enters the market to digest.
环境污染在几年前加剧，本来被人遗忘的普通口罩开始搭上“防雾霾”的快车道，几乎所有面向民用的口罩生产都以防霾为市场方向。
Environmental pollution worsened a few years ago, when a forlorn common mask began to appear in the "haze-proof" fast track, preventing almost all civilian-oriented mask production from becoming market-oriented.
随着这两年全国环境的大幅度改善，防霾概念口罩的市场需求正在走弱，直至近期疫情爆发。
With the dramatic improvement in the national environment over the past two years, the market for the Haze Concept Mask is weakening until the recent outbreak.
1月23日，长垣发动当地卫材企业重启生产。
January 23, Changyuan launched the local satellite enterprises to restart production.
长垣市市场监管局要求，“不在疫情期间囤货积奇，哄抬物价”，并严格控制产品质量，保证出厂医疗器械安全有效。
Changyuan Market Regulatory Authority asked, "do not stock up during the epidemic period, coax prices" and strictly control the quality of products to ensure the safety and effectiveness of medical equipment.
另外，号召企业发挥社会责任，克服困难，抓紧备战组织生产。
In addition, enterprises are called upon to exercise social responsibility to overcome difficulties and organize production for war.
同长垣一样，国内更多分散的口罩生产企业陆续开动，尽管能够生产N95的企业不多，但其他标准口罩的产能正在迅速恢复。
As with Changyuan, more of the country's scattered mask-makers are moving ahead, and while few are able to produce N95, capacity for other standard masks is rapidly recovering.
例如广州一家企业因亏损多年，已在2019年4月启动注销程序，目前开始恢复生产。
For example, a company in Guangzhou, which had been losing money for many years, had initiated a write-off procedure in April 2019 and was now resuming production.
下游热情带动上游复苏下游热情带动着上游复苏。
Downstream enthusiasm drives upstream recovery and downstream enthusiasm drives the upstream recovery.
N95和KN95等有过滤防护等级口罩，最核心的原料是熔喷无纺布。
N95 and KN95 have filter protection grade masks, the most core material is melt spray non-woven cloth.
这是无纺布材料的一种，以往的原料医用纱布易掉纱线头，会引发伤口感染甚至医疗事故，因此如今几乎看不到纱布口罩，几乎都改成纤维相互缠结、没有线头的无纺布。
This is a kind of nonwoven material, medical gauze easy to lose yarn head, can cause wound infection and even medical accidents, so that gauze mask can hardly be seen today, almost all into fiber entangled, non-woven fabric.
无纺布按生产工艺可分为水刺、热合、湿法、纺粘、熔喷等多种，其中熔喷无纺布采用独特技术，纤维直径可以达到0.5-10微米，超细纤维使熔喷布具有很好空气过滤性，成为口罩的核心滤材。
Non-woven according to the production process can be divided into spunlaced, hot, wet, spinning, melt-blown, and so on, among which the melt-jet non-woven fabric uses unique technology, fiber diameter can reach 0.5-10 micron, ultra-fine fibers so that the melt cloth has a good air filter, become the core filter materials.
生产熔喷布的江苏丽洋董事长尤祥银告诉我们，一吨熔喷布可以生产100万只医疗外科口罩或50万个以上的N95级别口罩。
Yuxiang Yin, Jiangsu Liyang's chairman, who produces melts, tells us that a tonne of spray can produce a million medical surgical masks or more than 500,000 N95 level masks.
苗圩春节前调研的天津泰达洁净材料有限公司，正是国内熔喷布的主要生产企业之一。
Tianjin Teda Clean Materials Co. Ltd is one of the main production enterprises of melt spraying cloth in China.
2009年5月，该公司上马全球第一套双组份熔喷生产线，年能从3000吨迅速上升到4500吨。
In May 2009, the company launched the world's first two-part fusible jet production line, capable of rapidly increasing from 3,000 tons to 4,500 tons annually.
目前，泰达洁净的熔喷总产能为7000吨。
At present, the total capacity of Teda clean fusible spray is 7,000 tons.
而早在2010年，全国熔喷布总产能就已突破5.8万吨。
As early as 2010, the country's total melting pot production capacity has exceeded 58,000 tons.
在疫情到来之前的2019年年中，优质熔喷布价格在每吨3万元左右，普通的每吨不到两万元。
By mid-2019, before the outbreak hit, the price of premium melt-jet fabric was around 30,000 yuan per ton, compared with less than 20,000 yuan per ton.
熔喷布和其他无纺布的原料是聚丙烯，这一化工原料主要由中石油、中石化提供，民营企业占比约为30%。
The raw material for the melt-jet and other nonwoven fabrics is polypropylene, a chemical mainly supplied by PetroChina and Sinopec, with private enterprises accounting for about 30 per cent.
2017年，中国聚丙烯总产能达到2350万吨，消费量为2420万吨，少部分来自进口。
In 2017, China will have 23.5 million tons of polypropylene capacity and 24.2 million tons of consumption, a small part of which will be imported.
原料供应量足够，而且1月31日，中石化新闻发言人吕大鹏代表中石化承诺：“抗疫期间，中国石化生产的医疗卫生用物资相关原料一律不涨价。
The supplies of raw materials were sufficient, and on January 31, Lu Dapeng, a spokesman for Sinopec News, promised on behalf of Sinopec: "During the period of fighting the epidemic, all the raw materials related to medical and health-related materials produced by Sinopec will not rise in price.
”然而，短时间的原料供需不平衡的确存在。
Yet short-term imbalances between supply and demand for raw materials do exist.
长垣当地口罩生产企业介绍：原来口罩专用过滤材料熔喷布的市场价格为1.8万元/吨，现在价格是2.9万元/吨，但依旧很难买到货。
The original market price of the special mask filter material is 18,000 yuan per ton, but now it is 29,000 yuan per ton, but it is still difficult to buy.
叠加上春节期间人工成本的问题，四川、广东、山东等多地的口罩生产企业都面临与河南长垣一样的窘境：近期都在亏本生产。
Overlay the issue of labor costs during the Spring Festival, Sichuan, Guangdong, Shandong and many other places face the same dilemma as Henan Changyuan: recently are losing production.
“大多数生产口罩和防护服的企业不仅不向经销商涨价，而且要求经销商不准向医院涨价。
"Most companies that manufacture masks and protective clothing not only don't increase prices for dealers, they also require dealers not to raise prices to hospitals.
”河南长垣两家医疗器械公司董事长证实，医用普通口罩出厂价每个9分钱左右，不到一钱，医用外科口罩每个在4毛钱到4毛5分之间。
The chairman of two medical-device companies, Changyuan, Henan, confirmed that generic surgical masks cost about nine cents each, less than a penny, and that surgical masks cost anywhere from 40 cents to 45 cents each.
口罩行业长期都是薄利，代工企业利润更更薄利。
Mask industry has long been a thin profit, more profit-making contract enterprises.
江苏省江阴某口罩工厂曾对外表示，工厂一年给日本代工口罩3亿只，每只出厂价两分钱，每只赚不到五厘钱。
A mask factory in Jiangyin, Jiangsu province, once said that the factory gives 300 million face masks to Japan a year.
诸多口罩生产商对我们证实了这一利润数据。
Many mask makers have confirmed the profit figures to us.
在终端销售环节，尽管阿里、京东等电商平台严禁口罩涨价，但依然阻止不了经销商通过各种方式提高零售价格。
In the terminal sales link, although Ali, Jingdong and other electrical business platforms strictly prohibit mask prices, but still can not stop dealers through various ways to increase retail prices.
实际上，只要涨幅不是特别夸张，更多消费者也认可目前的紧迫形势。
In fact, as long as the increase is not particularly exaggerated, more consumers also recognize the current urgency of the situation.
但在举国抗疫的大背景下，超高价零售口罩都被重罚，产业链上任何企业都不敢恶意“发国难财”。
But in the national anti-epidemic background, the ultra-high price retail masks have been heavily fined, the industrial chain of any enterprise dare not maliciously "development of national wealth."
沉重的车轮一旦运转起来，难免会有人头脑发昏。
Once the heavy wheels start to work, it is inevitable that someone will lose their mind.
“2003年非典之前口罩厂家并不多，非典期间以及之后出现一轮井喷，后来因为雾霾又冒出来一些企业，现在雾霾没有那么严重，又有一些口罩企业被淘汰了。
"There were not many manufacturers of face masks before SARS in 2003. There was a spate of blowouts during and after SARS, but now the haze is not so severe and some mask companies have been eliminated," he said.
”国家劳动保护用品质量监督检验中心（武汉）主任刘宏斌在接受《华夏时报》采访时称，“此前国内的口罩企业过的并不滋润，甚至产能严重过剩。
Liu Hongbin, director of the State Labor Protection Quality Supervision and Inspection Center (Wuhan), told the China Times: "Before this domestic mask companies have not moistened, even serious overcapacity.
2009年4月15日开始，甲型H1N1流感肆虐全球，口罩随即火了起来，带动上游熔喷布价格疯涨，从每吨2万元猛增至13万元。
Starting on April 15, 2009, as influenza A (H1N1) raged around the world, masks caught fire, driving up the upstream price of jet fabric from $20,000 to $130,000.
这场最初被叫做“猪流感”的疫情发端于美国，中国受影响较小，很多口罩需求来自海外。
The outbreak, originally known as swine flu, began in the United States, with China less affected and many of the demand for masks coming from overseas.
国内没有市场监管、没有涨价禁令，企业按照自己对市场的判断扩建产能。
There is no domestic market regulation, no price ban, enterprises according to their own judgment of the market expansion capacity.
2009年，全国熔喷布产能增加41%，泰达洁净正是那时上马的新生产线。
In 2009, there was a 41 per cent increase in national smelter capacity, when Tedda Cleansing was the new production line.
H1N1疫情在当年7月份基本得到控制，口罩一夜之间卖不动了，刚投资几百万元的生产线被搁置。
The H1N1 epidemic was largely contained in July of that year, and the masks went out of business overnight, putting aside millions of dollars worth of production lines.
中国很多口罩和无纺布企业第一次尝到盲目扩张的滋味。
For the first time, many Chinese mask and non-woven enterprises have tasted blind expansion.
此后，才有了技术提升、开发渗水和吸音材料、转投制鞋和汽车内饰等熔喷行业自救行为。
Since then, there has been technological upgrading, development of soakaway and sound-absorbing materials, the conversion of shoes and car interior, and other fusible industry self-help behavior.
直到“雾霾”成为关键词，口罩再次受重视，全行业稍作喘息。
Until "fog haze" becomes the keyword, mask is again valued, the industry a little respite.
随着雾霾消散、医药控费，口罩行业又一次沉寂，时值近期，一批中小企业因亏本生产、无偿捐赠，成为中国制造业的“逆行者”。
As the haze dissipates and medical fees are contained, the mask industry is once again silent. Recently, a number of small and medium-sized enterprises have become the "detractors" of China's manufacturing industry by producing at a loss and donating free of charge.
