这款游戏，让我对瘟疫有了新认识。

点击上方物质生活参考加星标！物质生活参考作者：王路来源：物质生活参考（ID：wzshck）洗手有多重要？来复习一下标准答案：和戴口罩一样重要，有时可能还更重要。
How important it is to wash your hands? Review the standard answer: Wearing a mask is as important as, and sometimes more important than, wearing a mask.
经历了这么多天密集轰炸式卫生常识再教育，平时再懒的人，现在在洗手这件事上都勤快得不可思议，恨不得把手洗秃噜皮。
After so many days of intensive bombing-style health education, people who are lazy now wash their hands incredibly diligent, would like to purr their hands.
如果想加深自我教育，以沉浸式体验的方式进一步认识洗手的重要性，我推荐玩一回《瘟疫公司》。
If you want to deepen your self-education and learn more about the importance of hand washing through immersion, I recommend Plague.
这是一款不走寻常路的游戏：其他游戏里，玩家一般都要去拯救世界，但《瘟疫公司》正相反，我们要操纵细菌、病毒之类的病原体，进化出致命瘟疫，毁灭全世界。
It's a no-nonsense game: in other games, players are generally going to save the world, but Plague, on the contrary, manipulates pathogens such as bacteria and viruses to evolve deadly plagues that destroy the world.
简而言之，在这个游戏里，我们都是丧心病狂的反人类分子。
In short, in this game, we are all deranged anti-human elements.
而反人类分子们毁灭世界时面临重大阻力之一，就是洗手。
One of the great resistance to the destruction of the world by anti-human elements is hand washing.
进入游戏后，我们首先要选择难度等级，有简单、普通、困难三种模式。
After entering the game, we must first choose the difficulty level, there are simple, ordinary, difficult three modes.
如图，决定难度等级的第一条指标，就是全世界人民是否爱洗手。
The first indicator of difficulty levels, as shown, is whether people around the world wash their hands.
大家都不爱洗手，瘟疫就很容易传播，即简单模式。
People don't wash their hands. Plague is easy to spread. Simple patterns.
所有人都洗手，瘟疫传播的难度就大大提高，就是困难模式。
All hands wash their hands, and the spread of the plague has become much more difficult, a difficult pattern.
如果你决定挑战困难模式，那么恭喜你，接下来艰难的通关历程会让你无比深刻地认识到：洗手这件简单的小事，真的能拯救世界。
If you decide to challenge Hard Mode, congratulations, the next difficult customs will give you a profound understanding of how simple washing your hands can really save the world.
《瘟疫公司》教给我们的知识点，远远不止洗手。
Plague teaches us much more than washing our hands.
玩过这个游戏的人，不光能大致了解细菌和病毒的不同，还能对世界地理有更深入的认识，甚至可以聊一聊商业推广的套路和谣言传播的机制。
Those who have played the game not only have a general understanding of the differences between bacteria and viruses, but also have a deeper understanding of the world's geography, and can even talk about business marketing practices and rumour-spreading mechanisms.
所以说，打游戏确实能涨知识。
So it is true that playing games increases knowledge.
不骗你。
Don't deceive you.
01.新冠疫情爆发后，《瘟疫公司》无疑是讨论度最高的游戏，没有之一。
After the outbreak of the New Crown, Plague was undoubtedly one of the most discussed games of all time.
首先是一张“神预言”截图在社交媒体疯狂刷屏。
The first is a "God Prophecy" screenshot crazily painted on social media.
这张来自《瘟疫公司》玩家自制的扩展包的截图显示，2015年就有人预测“2020年新的冠状病毒出现”，并且“和SARS有一定的相似性”。
This screenshot of an extension kit made by the Plague player shows that "a new coronavirus is predicted for 2020" and that "there is some resemblance to SARS."
而随着疫情发展，新冠病毒的传染性和隐蔽性，又令玩家们细思极恐。
With the development of the epidemic, the new crown virus infectivity and concealment, but also make players think very scared.
在《瘟疫公司》中，传染性和致命性的关系，可以说是游戏的核心玩法和终极攻略。
In Plague, the relationship between infectivity and lethality is arguably the heart of the game and the ultimate strategy.
游戏中，玩家需要精心控制瘟疫的症状。
In the game, players need to carefully control the symptoms of the plague.
初期症状要尽可能轻微，最好不要致死。
The initial symptoms should be as mild as possible and preferably not fatal.
这一方面是防止人们过早提高警惕，加快研制解药速度。
On the one hand is to prevent premature vigilance, speed up the development of the antidote.
另一方面，如果瘟疫早期致死率过高，会导致宿主死亡过快，来不及传染足够多的人。
On the other hand, too high an early death rate can cause the host to die too fast to infect enough people.
同时，瘟疫的传染性则要尽可能提高。
At the same time, the epidemic should be as contagious as possible.
最理想的状况，是悄无声息地感染全世界。
The ideal situation would be to infect the world quietly.
之后，再操纵病原体进行突变，进化成能迅速致命的瘟疫。
The pathogen is then manipulated to mutate into a rapidly deadly plague.
新冠病毒令人防不胜防的传染性和隐蔽性，颇为符合这个“悄悄感染全世界、一波大招全带走”的套路。
The unstoppable infectivity and invisibility of the new crown virus fits the pattern of "creeping the world and taking it all away."
好在游戏毕竟不是现实，《瘟疫公司》官方也及时敬告玩家，游戏中采用的并不是科学的传染病模型，“建议玩家直接从当地或国际权威机构获取信息”[1]。
Fortunately, the game is not a reality, and Plague Company officials are duly alerted to the fact that the game does not use a scientific model of infectious disease, and that "players are advised to obtain information directly from local or international authorities" and & # 91; 1; 1 & # 93;
《瘟疫公司》因这次疫情而广受关注，但它并不是因为蹭到了热点而翻红。
Plague is widely known for the epidemic, but it is not a hot spot.
从2012年问世起，它一直热度很高，常年出现在在各大付费游戏榜单上。
Since its inception in 2012, it has been hot, appearing all year round on the list of paid games.
如此长盛不衰且广受欢迎，让人很难想象，这款游戏是一位市场分析咨询师用业余时间开发的，整个开发成本才不到5000美元。
It's hard to imagine a game so long and so popular that it cost less than $5,000 to develop in the spare time of a market analyst consultant.
游戏发售时，开发者James Vaughan的愿望仅仅是能收回这5000美元投资。
When the game went on sale, developer James Vaughan wanted to recoup the $5, 000 investment.
而现在，他的游戏已经在各个平台卖掉了超过1亿份[2]。
His games have now sold more than 100 million copies of his service on every platform; 2 & # 93; & # 93;
投入产出比无敌。
Input-output ratio invincible.
打开游戏，你立刻就能感受到低成本制作的贫穷气息。
Open the game and you'll instantly feel the poverty of low-cost production.
没有酷炫画面，游戏界面就是一张世界地图，传达信息全靠最简单的文字提示。
There is no cool screen, the game interface is a map of the world, the message depends on the simplest text hint.
（请忽略我取名的水平）不要小看这些文字信息。
(Please ignore the level of my name) Don't underestimate the textual information.
它实际上在提醒我们瘟疫的最可怕之处：不可预知。
It is actually a reminder of the worst part of the plague: unpredictability.
每次瘟疫发生时，整个世界毫无察觉。
Every time a plague strikes, the whole world goes unnoticed.
滚动新闻里一片太平，世界卫生组织甚至还在乐观地预测人类将走向长寿时代。
The rolling news is so peaceful that the World Health Organization is even optimistically predicting an age of longevity.
而在游戏结尾时，人类大批死亡，国家相继垮台，令人触目惊心。
And at the end of the game, the mass death of human beings, the collapse of the country, shocking.
回过头看，当我们过着平静而琐碎的生活时，致命的瘟疫其实随时都有可能在身边悄悄发生，只是我们一无所知。
In retrospect, when we lead a quiet and trivial life, deadly plagues can happen quietly around us at any moment, but we know nothing about it.
游戏开局，需要选择第一个感染瘟疫的国家。
Game start, need to choose the first country infected with the plague.
人口密度高的中国、印度，以及与世界各地几乎都有直通航班的沙特，都能让你的开局十分顺利。
China, India with its high population density, and Saudi Arabia, which has nearly all the world's direct flights, can get you off to a good start.
这也对应了沉重的现实：作为一个人口众多的欧亚大国，中国防疫的外部条件确实相当不利。
This also corresponds to the heavy reality that, as a large Eurasian country with a large population, the external conditions for epidemic prevention in China are indeed quite unfavourable.
而与我们相反，防疫外部条件最有利的国家，就是那些远离大陆的岛国。
In contrast to us, the countries with the most favourable external conditions for epidemic prevention are those that are far from the mainland.
譬如格陵兰，全境四分之三都处在北极圈内，偏居一隅、地广人稀、气候严寒，是各种病原体最难传染的地方。
In Greenland, for example, three-quarters of the country is in the Arctic Circle, isolated, sparsely populated and with a very cold climate, where pathogens are most difficult to transmit.
于是在《瘟疫公司》中，格陵兰号称“人类之光”。
So in Plague, Greenland claims to be the "light of man."
无数次，你已经把整个地球都感染得差不多，而它还是一片白茫茫的净土。
Countless times, you have infected the whole earth, and it is still a vast expanse of pure land.
瘟疫杀死了全世界超过99%的人，却对格陵兰岛上不到6万人望洋兴叹。
The plague has killed more than 99% of the world's population, while less than 60,000 people in Greenland bemoan it.
游戏过程中，你会使用各种不同的病原体，它们的特征也都会在玩法中有所体现。
During the game, you will use a variety of pathogens, their characteristics will also be reflected in the play.
比如真菌这一关，就几乎让所有萌新打到自闭。
Fungi, for example, shut almost all germination to its own limit.
真菌很难远距离传播，想让它感染全世界的人非常困难。
Fungi are difficult to spread over long distances, and it is very difficult to infect people all over the world.
最常出现的状况是，你的真菌好容易才扩散到格陵兰和马达加斯加，但解药已经研制完成，Game Over。
The most common condition is that your fungus spreads easily to Greenland and Madagascar, but the antidote has been developed, Game Over.
游戏中还会出现各种随机事件，有些会加速瘟疫的传播，比如经常被触发的“里约奥运会”。
There will also be random events, some of which will accelerate the spread of the plague, such as the often-triggered "Rio Olympics."
通常，人们会不顾疫情，如期举办奥运会，结果将瘟疫扩散到了更多国家。
Usually, people will ignore the epidemic, host the Olympic Games on schedule, the result of the epidemic spread to more countries.
此时再说“他们本不该去”，已经晚了。
It was too late to say "they shouldn't have gone."
当现实中有疫情正在发生、而且几乎就在身边时，重新玩《瘟疫公司》，不可避免地会感到一种额外的沉重。
When there's an epidemic happening and it's almost there, replaying Plague will inevitably feel an extra burden.
你很难再以轻松的心态面对地图上数字的变化。
It's hard to face the change in numbers on the map with a light heart.
因为关掉游戏回到现实，新闻里不断增长的感染者、死亡者数字背后，都是活生生的人。
Because shut down the game to return to reality, the news of the growing number of infected, dead, are living people.
游戏中，当你看着人类终于研究出解药、感染者大批恢复健康、瘟疫宣告终结时，并不会像平时输掉游戏时那样挫败。
In the game, when you see humans finally develop the antidote, the infected mass recovery, the end of the plague announced, not as usual when the game lost.
相反，你可能会松一口气，并且偷偷希望：如果病毒能像我一样菜，那就太好了。
Instead, you might take a sigh of relief and secretly hope that if the virus is as good as I am, it will be great.
02.《瘟疫公司》让我们代入细菌病毒的视角去毁灭人类，而若干年前，《魔兽世界》的一次bug事故，则堪称是虚拟世界中的公共卫生事件。
2. Plague allows us to destroy humans in the perspective of bacterial viruses, whereas a World of Warcraft bug some years ago was a public health event in a virtual world.
2005年，《魔兽世界》1.7版本推出了一个20人团队副本。
In 2005, World of Warcraft version 1.7 released a copy of a 20-person team.
最终Boss有一个叫“堕落之血”的伤害技能，可以让玩家持续10秒钟不断掉血。
Boss eventually has a damage ability called "Fallen Blood," which allows players to drop blood for up to 10 seconds.
“堕落之血”能传染，一旦中招，身边的队友和玩家在游戏里的宠物都会染上持续掉血状态。
"The blood of depravity" can infect, once win, the teammate and the player in the game's pet can infect continuously the blood loss condition.
一般来说，打完Boss，玩家和宠物身上的非正常状态就会随之消失。
Generally speaking, the abnormal situation of players and pets will disappear after the Boss is played.
但因为出了bug，“堕落之血”在玩家的宠物身上潜伏了下来，而且依然具有传染性。
But because of the bug, "Fallen Blood" lurks on the player's pet and remains contagious.
当不知情的玩家返回主城，重新放出宠物时，立刻感染了自己和大批人群。
When an unwitting player returns to the main city and releases his pet again, he immediately infects himself and a large crowd.
虚拟世界的瘟疫就此爆发。
The plague of the virtual world broke out.
大多数人的第一反应是不知所措。
The first reaction of most people is to be overwhelmed.
有人慌不择路地逃离主城，却不慎把“瘟疫”扩散到了其他地方。
Someone rushed out of the main city, but inadvertently spread the "plague" to other places.
更有人不顾官方的劝告，故意带着“瘟疫”出城，到处感染别人。
More people disregard the official advice, deliberately with the "plague" out of the city, people everywhere infected.
同时，也有好心的玩家站在“疫区”门口，喊话提醒其他玩家不要贸然进入。
At the same time, there are also well-meaning players standing in the "epidemic area" door, shouting to other players not to rush into.
一些玩治疗职业的玩家组成了救援队，不停地给受感染的玩家加血[3]。
Some players in the healing profession have formed rescue teams, constantly adding blood and # 91; 3 & # 93; & # 93; to infected players.
（当时美服“尸横遍野”现场）当然，这一切都发生在虚拟空间，因“瘟疫”而“死”的玩家都能复活。
Of course, all of this took place in virtual space, where players who died of the plague were able to resurrect themselves.
那些故意传播“瘟疫”的人，大多只是出于恶作剧或出风头的心理。
Those who deliberately spread the "plague", mostly out of mischief or publicity mentality.
但这些场景，依然足以映照出现实世界发生瘟疫时的众生相。
But these scenes are still enough to reflect the reality of the real world when the plague.
这场共计造成约400万玩家被感染的“瘟疫”，引起了传染病研究者的兴趣，因为它的发生和传播过程与现实中的传染病颇有相似之处。
The plague, which infected about four million players, has caught the attention of infectious disease researchers because it occurs and spreads in a way similar to real-life infectious diseases.
比如，像许多新型病毒一样，它首先是从动物（游戏中的宠物）传播到人身上，然后经由“零号病人”实现人传人。
Like many new viruses, for example, it spreads first from animal (game pets) to humans, and then from person to person via Patient Zero.
《魔兽世界》的运营者暴雪公司，一度也采取了类似于建立隔离区的方式阻止“瘟疫”蔓延，但效果不佳。
Blizzard, the World of Warcraft operator, once took a similar approach to the quarantine zone to stop the plague from spreading, but with little success.
这同样和现实世界瘟疫爆发时的情况如出一辙。
The same is true of the real-world plague.
国际货币基金组织2006年的一份报告曾指出，尽管各国可以采取关闭边界、交通管制等方式，但这只能延缓、而无法彻底阻止疫情的蔓延。
A 2006 IMF report noted that, while countries could close their borders and enforce traffic controls, that would only slow, but not halt, the spread of the epidemic.
不过，《魔兽世界》终究是一个游戏。
However, "World of Warcraft" is a game after all.
当一切措施无效时，运营者可以改掉bug，重启服务器，“瘟疫”也就会随之结束。
When all else fails, the operator can fix the bug, restart the server, and the plague ends.
而在现实世界的公共卫生领域，没有这样手到病除的选项[4]。
In real-world public health, there is no such hand-to-hand service at & # 91; 4 & # 93; & # 93;
03.在虚拟生活与现实世界无限接近的当下，游戏已经不只是现实的映射。
At a time when virtual life is infinitely closer to the real world, games are more than just a mapping of reality.
它的影响力在逐步扩展到线下，并与现实议题互动。
Its influence is gradually expanding offline and interacting with real-world issues.
早在2013年，美国疾控中心就曾邀请《瘟疫公司》制作人James Vaughan做演讲，主题是如何为瘟疫传播建立模型，以及这款游戏如何提高公众对传染病的认识[5]。
Back in 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention invited James Vaughan, Plague Producer, to speak on how to model the spread of the plague and how the game has raised public awareness of infectious disease at & # 91; 5 & # 93; & # 93;
此后，《瘟疫公司》一直在向寓教于乐的方向发展。
Since then, Plague has been in the direction of edutainment.
去年，他们新增了三个新场景，其中两个都颇具现实教育意义。
Last year, they added three new scenes, two of which are quite educational.
一是“科学否定”，针对的是最近在国外兴起的“反疫苗者”。
One is "scientific denial," which refers to the "anti-vaccine" that has recently emerged abroad.
这群人因为无知或迷信，反对现代医学，拒绝打疫苗，不但害自己，而且也会导致所在地区传染病威胁上升，危害他人。
This group, through ignorance or superstition, opposes modern medicine and refuses to be vaccinated, not only to their own detriment, but also to the increased threat of infectious disease in their region, to the detriment of others.
“科学否定”场景设定的是一个被反科学者支配的世界。
The "scientific negation" scenario sets the stage for a world dominated by anti-scientists.
科学家被放逐、研制解药受阻，甚至连研发出来的解药都会被摧毁。
Scientists are banished, the development of an antidote is blocked, and even the developed antidote is destroyed.
有评论说，在这样一个世界里，游戏直接进入了超简单模式[6]。
Critics say that in such a world the game has entered super-simple models and # 91; 6 & # 93; & # 93; & # 39;
“科学否定”是对反疫苗、反科学者的反讽，另一个场景“虚假消息”，则是对造谣者的反讽。
"Scientific negation" is an anti-vaccine, anti-scientific irony, and another "false news" scene, is a disparaging disinformation.
“虚假消息”场景中，不再有细菌、病毒，你需要扮演一个超级谣棍，把你的谣言传播到全世界。
"False message" scene, no longer have bacteria, viruses, you need to play a super rumor, spread your rumors around the world.
在某种意义上来说，谣言就相当于是一种精神上的传染病，所以能近乎无缝套用《瘟疫公司》的游戏机制。
In a sense, rumors are tantamount to a mental infection, so the Plague mechanism can be almost seamlessly applied.
你可以选择要传播的谣言类型、发源者、造谣动机，然后随着谣言不断传播，使用各种传谣技巧：捏造细节、模糊关键信息、指责质疑者动机、挑动公众情绪、假“反转”、将辟谣者拖进无休止的细节纠缠……“虚假消息”的难度并不高，但它的意义并不在于攻略技巧，而是其中呈现的炮制谣言的伎俩。
You can choose the type of rumor to spread, the originator, the disinformation motive, and then use a variety of rumour-telling techniques as the rumour spreads: fabricating details, blurring key messages, blaming skeptics, stirring up public sentiment, fomenting public sentiment, fomenting disinformation, dragging rumors into endless details.
仔细看来，许多都如此似曾相识。
On closer inspection, many are so familiar.
无论是疾病、迷信还是谣言，《瘟疫公司》作为一个本身并不承担教育功能的的游戏，已经给了我们足够的知识和警示。
Whether it be disease, superstition or rumor, Plague Corporation, as a game that has no educational function of its own, has given us enough knowledge and warnings.
比起游戏赚了多少钱、创造了多高的日流水，这可能才是“虚拟照进现实”的最佳打开方式。
This is probably the best way to open "virtual reality" than how much money the game makes and how much water it creates.
