说不累肯定是假的，但是再累，也得坚持。
To say that you are not tired is false, but you must persist even if you are tired.
我们工作做到位了，小区居民的健康才能更有保障。
We have been able to do a bit of work, the health of residents in the community can be more secure.
希望这次疫情赶快过去。
I hope this outbreak is over soon.
口述 | 周　荣整理 | 应　琛我是静安区芷江西路街道三兴居民区的党总支书记。
At the request of AT & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
老实说，基层防控的压力是挺大的。
To be honest, the grass-roots control pressure is quite large.
我在这里工作了11年，面对这样程度的疫情也是第一次。
I have worked here for 11 years, and this is the first time I have faced an epidemic of this magnitude.
没有经验，很多工作也是边做边摸索。
Without experience, much of the work is done and groped for.
我从小年夜开始就没有休息过，我们居委会的其他人从初三开始也都一直没有停过。
I haven't had a rest since I was a kid. The other members of our neighborhood committee haven't stopped since the beginning of junior high school.
周荣在贴健康告示1月25日初一当天，我值班的时候，就接到有人举报辖区内的一家宾馆可能有问题。
When I was on duty on January 25, Zhou Rong received reports of a possible problem at a hotel in his district.
我便马上到该宾馆进行核实，这里果然住了一对从湖北云梦县来的老夫妻。
I immediately went to the hotel to check, here really live from Hubei Yunmeng County an old couple.
他们的儿子是租住在我们小区里的，因为家里地方小，老夫妻就住在了宾馆里，已经几天了。
Their son is rented in our small community, because the small home, the old couple has been living in the hotel, has been a few days.
我立即向街道汇报了这个情况。
I immediately reported the situation to the street.
我们居委会开展宣传工作其实还算比较早的，年前就贴了相关的告示，要求居民如果是从湖北省回来的一定要到居委会进行登记。
In fact, we neighborhood committee publicity work is relatively early, years ago posted a relevant notice, requiring residents to return from Hubei Province if they must be registered with the neighborhood committee.
初二那天早上，有一户居民主动打电话过来，说全家人初一晚上刚刚从湖北襄阳探亲回来，因为看到我们贴的告示知道这种情况需要告知居委会。
On the morning of the second day of junior high school, one of the residents volunteered to call and said that the whole family had just returned from Xiangyang, Hubei Province, on the first night of the first day of junior high school.
在辖区内开展健康宣传连续两件事情，让我觉得很慌，心里没有底，不知道居民区里到底还有多少这样的情况。
Health promotion in the district of two consecutive things, let me feel panic, the bottom line, do not know how much such a residential area.
因为当时，我们拿到的可疑名单都是从上面下来的，但是从小区自下而上的没有。
Because at the time, the suspicious lists we got came down from the top, but not from the bottom up in the neighborhood.
如果有人不那么自觉报上来，他从湖北回来或者有密切接触史的就躲在家里，如果他还出来走动了……这样的后果就很严重了，可能就是封小区了。
If someone comes home from Hubei or has close contact with him, he stays at home, if he comes out and walks... the consequences are serious. It could be a community.
想到这里，我立即让所有人初三来上班，大家开了个碰头会，准备对我们居民区管辖的三个小区1536户居民开展全面排查。
Thinking of this, I immediately sent everyone to work on the third day of the year, and we had a meeting to conduct a general survey of 1,536 residents of the three small districts under our residential jurisdiction.
1月28日，从早上8点开始，我们一共8个人，两人一组，就按照划定的区块分头去居民家敲门。
On January 28th, starting at 8 a.m., we had eight people, in groups of two, going to the house and knocking at the door according to the division.
后来觉得时间不够，为了增加效率，我们又变成每个人单独行动，一旦有人完成了自己分包的区块，就立即支援其他人，一直到晚上8点。
Later, feeling short of time, in order to increase efficiency, we moved on to everyone acting alone, and once someone had completed his subcontracted block, he immediately supported the others until 8 p.m.
第二天，我们就把前一天剩余的人家全部走访到了。
The next day we visited the rest of the house the day before.
居委会挨家挨户地敲门进行登记第一轮排查，我们大概敲开了800多户居民的门。
The neighborhood committee knocked on the door door to door for the first round of checks, and we probably knocked on the doors of more than 800 households.
一是登记他们去过哪里，有没有武汉相关接触史，二是建议他们减少外出，做好个人防护，如果有需要可以随时联系居委会。
One is to register where they have been to Wuhan, there is no relevant contact history, the other is to advise them to reduce travel, personal protection, if necessary, can contact the neighborhood committee at any time.
对于那些没有敲开的，我们会在门上贴上留言条，请他们看到第一时间联系居委会。
For those who did not knock, we would put a message on the door, inviting them to see the first contact with the neighborhood committee.
对于未开门的居民，周荣贴上了“留言条”我们要求达到百分之百的“见面率”，要么把门敲开见到本人，要么接到他们看到留言条后打过来的电话。
To the residents who did not open the door, Zhou Rong affixed a "message" we want to achieve 100% "meet rate," either knock the door to see me, or receive a message from them after the call.
对于没有“见面”的人家，我们后来就每天上下午两次再去敲门，直到敲开为止。
For those who did not meet, we would knock twice a day, twice a day, until it was struck.
其中，有一户我负责的人家，门上的留言条被撕了，但门却一直敲不开。
One of them, I was in charge of the family, the door message was torn, but the door has been unable to knock.
我大概敲了七八次之后，楼下保安和邻居都告诉我他们家其实是有人的。
After about seven or eight knocks, the security guard downstairs and the neighbors all told me that the family was in fact someone.
我就急了，不知道他们家是什么情况。
I was in a hurry and I didn't know what was going on in their house.
当时也是憋足了一口气，一天两次不够，那就来三次，我就不信敲不开你家的门了。
At that time was suffocating breath, twice a day is not enough, that came three times, I do not believe that you can not knock on your door.
终于，在第15次的时候，这户人家总算开门了。
At last, on the fifteenth day, the door was opened.
我当时长舒一口气，脱口而出：“拿本事阿蛮杜哦！（你们本事也是蛮大的）”了解下来得知，最早的时候，夫妻俩在家，但因为不确定我们的身份，以及害怕接触传染，故意没开门。
When I learned that the couple were at home at the earliest, they were not sure of our identity and did not open the door for fear of infection.
后来，有时候他俩会去小孩家帮忙带孙子，确实是不在家。
Later, they sometimes went to the children's house to help out with their grandchildren.
但看到我们小区又封门，又禁止外卖和快递进来，觉得其实挺安全的，这才放心给我们开了门。
But see our small area again close the door, forbid take-out and express delivery come in, feel actually quite safe, just feel at ease to open the door for us.
虽然给我们的工作增加了麻烦，但走的时候，我还是表扬了他们的这种谨慎。
Although it added trouble to our work, I praised them for their caution when we left.
毕竟面对疫情，小心一点总是没错的。
After all, it is always right to be careful in the face of epidemics.
居委会工作人员检查进小区的登记情况除了这对夫妻，我同事在排查的时候也发现了一户人家家里有湖北来的人。
In addition to the couple, my co-workers found a family with people from Hubei when they checked in.
开门的是一个男的说自己没有出过上海，但我同事看到屋里还有两个人。
The man who opened the door said he hadn't been out of Shanghai, but my co-worker saw two other people inside.
再三追问之下，对方才承认了自己是从湖北来的。
After much questioning, the other party admitted that he was from Hubei Province.
看到登记的名字之后，我马上反应过来，他们正是前几天我在宾馆查到的那一对老夫妻。
When I saw the registered name, I immediately reacted to it. They were the old couple I had found in the hotel the other day.
原来宾馆不让他们住了以后，他们便住到了儿子家。
When they were not allowed to stay at the hotel, they moved to their son's house.
我同事说，这对老夫妻当时就说，“你们动作怎么这么快，我昨天下午才住过来，又被你们逮到了”。
My colleague said that the old couple said at the time, "Why did you move so fast? I only came here yesterday afternoon and you caught me again."
大排查之后，每天我们都会开会更新进度。
After a thorough search, we meet every day to update our progress.
有次，开会的时候，我低头一看，突然发现脚上穿的鞋子都裂开了。
One time, when I was in a meeting, I looked down and saw that the shoes on my feet were all cracked.
他们也看了看自己穿的鞋子，发现都有不同程度的磨损。
They also looked at the shoes they were wearing and found that they were all suffering from varying degrees of wear.
因为要走路，大家基本上都是盯着同一双合脚的鞋子在穿。
Because we walk, we're basically staring at the same pair of shoes that fit our feet.
磨损的鞋子针对发现的两户湖北相关的居民，医疗方面由社区医院、疾控中心的老师负责。
Wear shoes for the two families found in Hubei related residents, the medical aspects of the community hospital, the CDC teacher in charge.
而我们居委会，每天除了至少打一个电话，买菜、取快递等生活上的需要肯定都包了。
And we neighborhood committee, every day in addition to at least one telephone, shopping, express delivery and other life needs are sure to be wrapped up.
到目前（2月5日）为止，大概还有246户居民，我们没有联系上。
As of now (February 5), there are about 246 households, and we are not in contact.
现在这个数字每天在下降。
That number is falling every day.
接下去是返沪高峰了，我们会进一步跟进。
The next step is to return to Shanghai, and we will follow suit.
同样，还有辖区内企业的复工，我们也会积极和物业配合，开展相关工作。
Similarly, there are enterprises in the jurisdiction of the resumption of work, we will also actively cooperate with the property, related work.
前来预约购买口罩的居民进门前都要进行体温测量说不累肯定是假的，但是再累，也得坚持。
Residents who come to make an appointment to buy a mask have to take a temperature test to say no tiredness is sure to be false, but no matter how tired, also have to insist.
我们工作做到位了，小区居民的健康才能更有保障。
We have been able to do a bit of work, the health of residents in the community can be more secure.
希望这次疫情赶快过去。
I hope this outbreak is over soon.
