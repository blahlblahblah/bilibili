在所有人为物资、床位、治疗，为疫情防控和复工等议题奔忙时，一位艺术家倡导，每个外地人用自己的方式，找到和认识一个武汉朋友。
As everyone rushed for supplies, beds, treatment, disease control and resumption of work, an artist advocated that each stranger find and know a Wuhan friend in his own way.

从2月3日下午4点开始，24小时里，这个动作林子重复了至少1140遍。
The forest repeated at least 1,140 times in 24 hours, starting at 4 p.m. on February 3.
彼时，全国新增病例达到当时的历史最高点；湖北问责处理了三名省红会干部；李兰娟团队表示发现了抑制病毒的新药……而在绝大多数人赖以为信息平台的微博上，充满层出不穷的求助案例、道听途说的疫情消息、此消彼长的指责和谩骂。
At that time, the number of new cases reached a historical high; Hubei Accountability Office handled three cadres of the provincial Red Cross Society; Li Lanjuan's team said it had discovered a new drug to suppress the virus... while on microblogs, where most people rely on information platforms, there are endless requests for help, anecdotal information, accusations and abuse.
“我女朋友常常会因为这些信息而焦灼、愤怒，甚至流泪。
"My girlfriend often gets upset, angry, or even crying over this information.
我在想自己能做点什么。
I was wondering what I could do.
”待在北京的艺术家林子隐隐感到，也许有一些信息被夸大或扭曲了。
Lin Zi, an artist based in Beijing, feels vaguely that some of the information may have been exaggerated or distorted.
为何不让一个隔离区外的人，和一个武汉市民在微信上结成好友，关心彼此，分享自己的见闻和情感？“聊天记录可以被二次传播或至少留作历史的证据，为未来的展示提供可能。
Why not let a person outside the colony form good friends with a Wuhan citizen to care about each other and share what they see and feel? Chat records can be re-disseminated or at least retained as evidence of history, making it possible for future displays.
”林子把这个艺术项目命名为“认识一个武汉朋友”计划（以下简称“朋友计划”），制作了一张说明图片，在朋友圈发出。
Lin named the project "Meet a friend in Wuhan" (hereinafter referred to as the "friend program") and produced a caption of the project, which was distributed among friends.

“疫情线上交友俱乐部+论坛”1.0版由此诞生。
This led to the birth of version 1.0 of the 'Friends Online Club + Forum'.
“认识一个武汉朋友”计划发起人林子 图 / 林子按照林子的想法，朋友计划两端应该连接的是“在隔离区内但与疫情无（直接）关（系）的人”与“隔离区外与疫情无关的人”。
According to Lin Zi-tou, founder of the "Know a friend in Wuhan" project, the two sides of the plan should be linked by "people who are in the quarantine zone but have no (direct) connection with the outbreak" and "people outside the quarantine zone who have nothing to do with the outbreak."
小小激动的寒暄之后，热心人在群里抛出了患者求助信息填写表；有人表示愿意分享线上心理义诊资源；还有占卜师介绍静坐冥思方法、“为灾区祈福”的佛经音乐和法事。
After a small exhilaration, the enthusiast threw out a patient help sheet in the group; someone offered to share online psychological counseling resources; and a fortune-teller introduced meditation, "Pray for the disaster area" Buddhist music and law.
瑞德西韦试验究竟有没有用，也成了大家关心的问题。
The usefulness of the Rhetsevier experiment has also become a matter of concern to all.
总有人质疑新药试验是“拿人体当试验，不人道”，群成员、在上海药企做临床监察员的小王有点看不下去了，在群里科普：“我们一般试验入组要入两年的，瑞德西韦三期入组九天就入了75%了，他们试验方案是对照组四盲的。
Wang, a member of the group and a clinical supervisor at a pharmaceutical company in Shanghai, is a bit of an eyesore. In Qun Rikope: "We normally test into the group for two years, Rhetsevier III into nine days for 75%, they test a control group of four blind.
对照组也是用药的，大家都有得救治。

”小王的日常工作是做类似糖尿病等慢病的临床研究，需要经常去医院做患者访视，算是经验之谈。
Xiao Wang's daily job is to do clinical research on chronic diseases such as diabetes, which requires frequent visits to hospitals as a rule of thumb.
“病人需要签知情同意。
"Patients need to have informed consent.
会给他们买保险。
Will buy insurance for them.
如果有什么问题，先停药，用保险支付补偿。
If there is any problem, stop taking the medicine first and pay for it with insurance.
”在参与者曹夕看来，那会儿的计划群就像外界对武汉印象的一个小小缩影，慌乱匆忙，但好歹（问题）还在一个个解决。
Cao Xi, one of the participants, saw the plan group as a small miniature of Wuhan's impression from the outside world, panicked and hurried, but somehow [the problem] was still being solved.
共享信息、科普之外，群里的一些老摇滚迷开始怀念SMZB和达达乐队（均为成立于武汉的乐队），还有人提到Vox（武汉酒吧）组了个民间救援队伍，“算是很早很早的救援队了。
Outside the sharing of information and popular science, some of the group's older rock fans began to miss SMZB and Dada (both Wuhan-based bands), while others mentioned that Vox had formed a civilian rescue team, "a very early rescue team.

“这些还只是群里的杂谈。
"It's just gossip in the group.
要实现一对一的交流，需要迈出决定性的一步。

“疫情不是生活的全部”广东女孩珂琪找到的“舞伴”，是在武汉念书的一位孝感姑娘。
"The epidemic is not the whole of life" Guangdong girl found "dance partner", is in Wuhan to study a filial girl.
珂琪没有照微信名字称呼她，自始至终就叫她“小姐妹”。
Cosette did not address her by her name, but called her "little sister" from beginning to end.
而当我联系到孝感姑娘后，后者笑着让我直呼她“肥肥”。
And when I contacted filial piety girl, the latter smiled and let me call her "fat."
珂琪 图 /受访者提供在珂琪眼里，肥肥爽直、性子急，像另一个自己。
Cosette gave to Cosette what was in her eyes, fat, quick-tempered, like the other herself.
“她在武汉读书，好不容易回到孝感，她爸妈也不让她出门，她都快憋坏了。
"She is studying in Wuhan, hard to return to filial piety, her parents also refused to let her out of the house, she is nearly pent up.
群里聊起朋克之都武汉时，她就是最活跃的，是一个很爱玩的女生呵。
Wuhan, the capital of punk in the group, is the most active, is a very playful girl.
”爱玩的肥肥1月22日夜里刷手机，看到网上有人说封城，立马起来收拾东西，凌晨两点半，居然叫到了一部滴滴去火车站。
Love to play fertilizer on the night of January 22 brush mobile phones, see someone online said the city, immediately get up to pick up things, at 2: 30 a.m., unexpectedly called a drip to the station.
“对方说平时这个点我不会接单的，但是今天要去高铁站接朋友，顺便就接一个吧。
"The other side said that at this point in time I will not take orders, but today will go to the high-speed rail station to meet friends, by the way take one.
也真是幸运哦。
Lucky for me, too.
”她笑说自己不是怕病毒才连夜回老家。
"She smiled and said she wasn't afraid of the virus until she got home.
“我是怕我自己在那边（武汉）没钱吃饭饿死耶。
"I'm afraid I won't have enough money to eat and starve myself over there.
对我这个吃货来说这更糟糕。
It's even worse for my food.
在家里不用操心，有零食。
Don't worry about it at home. Snack.
在武汉每天还得管家里要钱，水深火热。
Every day in Wuhan, I still have to ask for money from my family.
”1月23日，清晨的武汉笼罩在一片迷雾里。
On January 23, Wuhan was enveloped in a fog in the early morning.
高铁上的肥肥看着窗外，想起了黑压压的电影《釜山行》。
The fat on the high-speed rail looks out of the window and reminds me of the dark movie Busan.
“心里很惆怅，但又相信肯定有阳光照耀的一天。
"" I feel sad, but I believe that there must be a sunny day.
”见到风尘仆仆的女儿，妈妈的第一反应是，“吓死了。

‘你一个人也就罢了，家里还有你妹妹呢，’怕啥，我就待自己房间里头。
'You are all alone, and your sister is at home; 'and I'll be in my own room for fear of anything.
”爸爸长年在深圳工作，一年顶多回家一次。
My father has been working in Shenzhen for years, returning home at most once a year.
肥肥告诉我，爸爸从来不懂照顾人，更不用说嘘寒问暖。
Fertilizer told me that Dad never knew how to take care of people, let alone booing and warming up.
这个年，钝感的老爸知道关心人了，全家四口也是头一回聚在一起给她过生日。
This was the first time a dull-witted dad had come together to celebrate her birthday.
肥肥觉得，珂琪发的朋友圈和自己蛮像的。
The fat thought that Cosette's circle of friends was pretty much like herself.
“她很乐观、‘沙雕’，不像别人钻牛角尖，老是发一些居高临下的观点。
"She is very optimistic, 'sand carving', unlike others who always make some condescending point of view.
那种太苕（蠢）了，什么都去批评。

Fat fat simply returns.
“而且有一天，你去到各个城市，哇，都还有我的朋友，大家都是兄弟姐妹，这太爽了。
"And one day, you go to every city, wow, all my friends, all brothers and sisters, that's so refreshing.
”珂琪被肥肥的这份生猛和热络打动。
Cosette was moved by the ferocity and warmth of the fat thing.
电话那头，她的声线比肥肥要略为沉稳些。
At the other end of the line, her voice was a little quieter than fat.
从小到大，珂琪热心为孤儿院、老人院服务的志愿活动，素来关注社会议题。
From childhood to adulthood, Cosette was keen to volunteer for orphanages and homes for the elderly, always focusing on social issues.
看到肥肥常常爆出一句，“哇，我要憋出精神病来啦！”珂琪忍不住笑她，“想进那儿（精神病院），可没那么容易。
It was not so easy to get in there, said Cosette, laughing at the constant fleshy outburst, "Wow, I'm going to pent up my psychosis!"
”珂琪家附近的小区，她觉得层层叠叠的标语很有意思图 / 珂琪研究生毕业前，珂琪因为读书压力太大、对自己能力产生怀疑、实习阶段被工作机构“压榨”，她的情绪到了临界点。
Before graduating from school, Cosette had reached a critical point because of the stress of reading, her doubts about her abilities, and the crushing of her internship by the work organization.
几天前，珂琪还在广东老家看心理医生。
A few days ago, Cosette was seeing a psychiatrist in her hometown in Guangdong.
每每想到武汉、湖北那些没找到病床的病人，支离破碎的家庭，冒着风险在一线工作的医护人员、工人，她就无法自抑。
Often think of Wuhan, Hubei those patients who have not found beds, broken families, risk in the front-line workers, health care workers, she can not restrain herself.
“医生跟我说，你除了关心他们，也要多关注自己。
"The doctor told me that you should pay more attention to yourself as well as to them.
”认识肥肥之后，两人不太聊疫情。
After getting to know Feifei, the two did not talk much about the epidemic.
肥肥直言自己是个玻璃心的人，实在没有办法承受太多。
Feifei said that he is a glass-hearted person, there is no way to bear too much.
“大家都知道形势很严峻。
"Everyone knows the situation is very serious.
如果事情发生在我（和家人）身上，该我当勇士，就不能逃跑。
If it had happened to me (and my family), I would have been a warrior, I would not have escaped.
但当我可以躲避的时候，我不想别人逼我去面对。
But when I can dodge, I don't want to be forced to face it.
”就在加入朋友计划的前夜，肥肥蜷缩在床上，就着一壶老酒，看了一场“卧室POGO线上云音乐节”。
On the eve of joining the Friends program, fat curled up in bed with a jug of old wine and watched a "bedroom POGO Online Cloud Music Festival."
直播时一发弹幕，她又认识了一两个好友。
She met one or two more of her best friends during the live broadcast.

For two hours, they screamed in all sorts of ways and "fell" into a favorite band.

”有轻微洁癖的珂琪，去年“双十一”期间就囤了很多消毒液和湿巾 图 / 珂琪“不那么完美的对象”自媒体编辑曹夕是最认真对待的参与者之一，她找到的武汉人叫小武，在位于光谷产业园的一家大型企业任工程师。
Cosette, who had a slight cleanliness habit, had been hoarding a great deal of disinfectant and wet towels during the Double-Eleven last year. Cao Xi, the media editor, was one of the most serious participants.
由于产业特殊，无法停产，过年至今，小武就没有出过工厂一步。
Due to the special industry, can not stop production, since the New Year, Xiao Wu has not been out of the factory.
光谷大道的夜晚 图 / 小武1月底前回到老家的员工都在隔离中，没法到岗。
Night maps of Gwangu Boulevard / Xiao Wu's employees who returned to their hometown by the end of January were isolated and unable to reach their posts.
剩下三分之一的留守员工压力陡增。
The remaining one-third are under intense pressure.
以前大约一两个月上一回夜班，一次十天。
I used to work at night about a month or two, ten days at a time.
疫情期间，小武已经上了两轮夜班——每次从晚上8点半上到第二天早上8点半。
During the outbreak, Xiao Wu was already on two rounds of night shifts -- from 8: 30 p.m. to 8: 30 a.m. the next.

It was light after work and silent and cold at work.
小武给曹夕发光谷一带街道的照片，介绍公司发的口罩。
Xiaowu gave Cao Xi Fat Guang Valley street photos, introduced the company issued a mask.
发得最多的还是食堂的午餐图。
The lunchtime pictures in the canteen were the most popular.
“挺难吃的。
"It's terrible.
我们开玩笑说，天天吃牢饭，呵呵。
We joked that every day to eat the food, hehe.
”吃货小武以前每周必到市区探店，火锅、烤串不间断，最近只能让胃受委屈。
Wu had to visit downtown every week before, and the hotpot and kebab didn't stop until recently, only to be wronged in the stomach.
小武公司的盒饭，他说食之无味。
Small Wu's boxed rice, he said the food is tasteless.
据说最近有了改进图 / 小武夜里待在办公室，空调却被关了。
It is said to have been improved recently / Xiao Wu stayed at the office at night, but the air conditioner was turned off.
小武说，一线工人工作更累，危险更大。
Xiao said front-line workers are more tired and at greater risk.
二线人员在办公室里，业务量不饱和时，常常也就是刷手机度日。
Second-line workers in the office, when the volume of business is not saturated, often is to brush the mobile phone to live.
去年下半年才入职的他理解公司的难处，也没有和工厂叫板的能力。
He, who only joined late last year, understands the company's difficulties and lacks the ability to call the shots at the factory.
认识小武的第三天，中午12点醒来，曹夕看到小武给她发的信息，“他们隔壁厂有人被确诊。
On the third day of meeting Xiao Wu, Cao Xi woke up at 12: 00 noon and saw the message sent to her by Xiao Wu.
其实1月的时候就有疑似感染了，其间救护车来了很多趟。
In fact, there was a suspected infection in January, during which ambulances came many times.
”小武所在的厂区离那家工厂相隔一公里，中间有条铁路隔开，封闭管理下问题应该不大。
Xiao Wu's factory was about a kilometer away from the factory, separated by a railway between them, and there should be little problem under closed management.
但小武心里还是紧巴巴的。
But Xiao Wu's heart is still tight.
“厂子附近一个社区的确诊人数，就几乎赶上省外某些城市的数量了。
"The number of people diagnosed in a neighborhood near the factory has almost caught up with the number in some cities outside the province.
”他告诉曹夕。
He told Cao Xi.

“就记得，群里最热闹的，除了建群时，就是李文亮去世那天夜里了。
"As far as I can remember, the liveliest crowds in the group, except for the building of the crowd, were the night of Li Wenliang's death.
大家聊到凌晨4点。
We chatted until 4 a.m.
”小武羡慕文科出身的，把媒体从业者叫作“文艺工作者”。
Xiao Wu envied the liberal arts origin and called the media practitioners "literary workers."
他觉得自己对曹夕和群里其他人来说，或许都称不上一个“理想的聊天对象”。
He felt that he might not be an "ideal chatterbox" for Cao Xi or the rest of the group.
除了工厂和附近地带，他掌握的有关武汉疫区的信息，不见得比外省的人多。
In addition to the factory and the surrounding area, he has no more information about Wuhan epidemic area than the provincial people.
但在曹夕这儿，小武就是一扇实实在在的小窗，“他就是另外一个层面上的普通的武汉人。
But here at Cao Xi, Xiao Wu is a real window, "he is another level of ordinary Wuhan people.
”曹夕和小武常常交流各自的涂鸦。
Cao Xi and Xiao Wu often exchanged graffiti.
左边是曹夕画的两只猫，小武称赞“有细节”；右边是小武画的猫，曹夕赞其“有灵魂”“此后如竟没有炬火，我便是唯一的光”曹夕也试着打开其他的窗，比如微博上认识的大学生小象。
Cao Xi painted two cats on the left. Xiao Wu praised "the details"; on the right was a cat painted by Xiao Wu. Cao Xi praised his "soul." Cao Xi also tried to open other windows, such as the little university student he met on Weibo.
之所以去微博上找，是因为计划群里的武汉朋友并不多，曹夕想避免和其他外地人“撞友”。
The reason to look for Weibo, because the plan group of Wuhan friends are not many, Cao Xi and other foreigners to avoid "friends."
几乎在同一个时间点，林子也觉得群聊这种形式背离了初衷，他号召大家采用“去中心化”的各种方式，比如发动周围朋友来介绍武汉的朋友。
At about the same time, Lin also felt that group chatting was a deviation from the original intention. He called on everyone to take a decentralized approach, such as inviting friends around to introduce Wuhan friends.
加上有些激进的言论他也无法把控，于是1140人的群聊群主和管理权，都被林子转让给了群里的朋友。
Coupled with some radical statements, he could not bring charges against them, so that the chatter and management of the 1140 were transferred from the forest to his friends in the group.

“上百万（粉丝）级的大V够不着，人家也不太会转发普通患者的求助信息，多半是捐款捐物吧。

一般最有效的就是转发给10-20万的大V。
The most effective is usually forwarded to 100,000 to 200,000 large V's.

In fact, during the program implementation, someone had already asked the Lin: You are here to discuss some of these things, why not help those in need?
