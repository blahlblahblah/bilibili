本文是协作者在“农民工抗疫救援行动”中，针对困境农民工家庭开展的个案访谈之一，旨在快速识别疫情中的脆弱人群及其需求，为疫情防控和救援工作提供参考，我们整理出来与你分享。

疫情下的深呼吸——困境农民工家庭个案实录（十）不上班就得吃老本，我们没钱吃啥老本口述者：刘兴（化名）打工所在地：北京编者注：刘兴，51岁，1988年从内蒙农村来京打工，右眼失明，左眼白内障，因手术风险较大无法做手术。
We have no money to eat. Liu Xing, 51 years old, came to Beijing in 1988 to work in Beijing from Inner Mongolia, blind in the right eye, cataract in the left eye, unable to operate because of the greater risk of surgery.
现在做车管员工作。
Now work as a mechanic.
妻子36岁，智力二级残疾，无业在家。
His wife is 36 years old, mentally handicapped II, unemployed at home.
儿子16岁，读初中三年级，平时内向少言，对自己的未来充满迷茫。
16-year-old son, junior high school third grade, usually introverted less, his own future full of confusion.
我初中毕业，学历不高。
I graduated from junior high school with a low education.
1988年，我跟着一个在北京当兵的表叔来北京打工。
In 1988, I came to Beijing to work with a cousin who was a soldier in Beijing.
刚来的时候没有地方住，我就在北京站住，被警察抓住给送过几次收容所。
When I first arrived without a place to live, I stopped in Beijing and was caught by the police and taken to a shelter several times.
这些年，我从事过各种工作，近年来视力越来越不好，好多工作干不了。
In these years, I have been engaged in various kinds of work, in recent years, eyesight is getting worse, many jobs can not be done.
马善被人骑，人善有人欺2017年大兴大火之后，我们搬到了木樨园，跟这边人不和。
After a huge fire broke out in 2017, we moved to Muxyuan, where we were at loggerheads with people.
这边人欺生，我平时上班不在家，邻居觉得我家没人，老实巴交的，反正就是马善有人骑，人善有人欺。
This person deceives a person, I usually work at home, neighbors feel that my home is empty, old Shibao, anyway is a horse good people ride, good people bullied.
有两回险些有冲突，然后就跟他们解释，咱们都是来北京打工的，相识就是缘分。
On two occasions, we almost had a conflict, and then explained to them, we are all to work in Beijing, acquaintance is fate.
他们说“谁跟你是缘分啊！”我跟房东也说过他们欺负我们的事，我们在院里洗的衣服晾在门口就找不着了，还有一次我的自行车放在外边被弄上屎、手纸什么的。
They said, "Who is fate with you!" I told the landlord they bullied us, we hung our clothes in the yard to dry at the door, and on one occasion my bicycle was left outside with a piece of shit or toilet paper.
这院里一共四家，都是亲戚。
There are four families in this courtyard, all related.
房东说：“现在住的房子已经换了好几家了，就是因为跟这几家不和。
The landlord said: "The house has been changed several times, because of discord with these families.
他们住这个院子里十多年了，不愿意让别人在这住。
They've lived in this yard for more than ten years and don't want anyone else to live here.
”后来他们看我们挨欺负也认，也不言语，就拉倒了，现在关系处的还行。
"And afterward they saw that we were being bullied, and that we were speechless; and they brought us down: and now the relations are doing well.
▲ 协作者社会工作者到刘兴家里探望（拍摄于2019年暑期）一个月下来几乎不剩钱我现在做车管员， 一个月3000块钱，我眼睛不好，看东西模糊。
Co-author social workers visit Liu Xing's home (filmed in the summer of 2019) for a month with almost no money left I am now a car manager, 3000 yuan a month, my eyes bad, things blurred.
2019年夏天，领导让我休息了一个多月，说白了就是不想要我，也没给我发工资。
In the summer of 2019, the leader let me rest for more than a month, to put it bluntly, do not want me, also did not pay me.
后来我又找了领班，说家里不容易，才又让我上了。
Then I found a leader, said the family is not easy, just let me on.
孩子学费五六千元，得跟朋友、亲戚借钱，还得跟学校说好话，过一段时间再交。
Children tuition five or six thousand yuan, have to borrow money from friends, relatives, and have to speak nice to school, after a while to pay.
每次都是等我上班攒两三个月才能把借的学费钱还清，但是没多久又得交下学期的学费了，总是这样倒不过来。
Every time I save up to two or three months to pay off the tuition fees, but soon have to pay next semester's tuition fees, always such a failure.
目前我们房租水电一个月1000元，孩子学校离家得有40里地，坐公交上学100多元/月，早饭200元/月，一个月下来几乎不剩钱。
At present, we rent 1,000 yuan a month for rent, 40 miles from home for children's school, 100 yuan / month for public transportation, 200 yuan / month for breakfast, and almost no money left for the end of a month.
今年过年就给孩子买双棉鞋，我们俩什么衣服都没买，能凑合穿就行。
Buy a pair of cotton shoes for our children this New Year. We haven't bought any clothes, we can make do with them.
孩子妈妈有二级智力障碍残疾证，前年开始发钱补贴，每月300元，听说老家有人已经收到了八九百元，在北京我们也没法证实。
The mother of the child has a second degree mental retardation certificate, the year before yesterday began to pay money subsidies, 300 yuan a month, heard that someone in his hometown has received 800, 900 yuan, we can not confirm in Beijing.
她老说头疼，每个月得买药，医生说她是神经性头疼，智力障碍对大脑有影响。
She always says she has headaches, she has to buy medicine every month, doctors say she has a nervous headache, and mental disorders have an effect on the brain.
她应该经常吃药，但是太贵了，根据我们的经济情况，要是有钱就买点，没钱就不买。
She should always take medicine, but it's too expensive. According to our financial situation, if you have money, buy some, but if you have no money, don't buy it.
我们有新农合，但只能报50%，以前就报过一回，半年之后才能报下来。
We have new farmers' cooperation, but we can only quote 50%. We have reported it once before and can't report back until half a year later.
因为你本人不在家，他就不愿意给报，你还得老催他，老是一拖再拖的，而且我们在北京买药也不能报销。
Because you are not at home, he will not give you back, you have to keep pressing him, and we can't reimburse you for buying medicine in Beijing.
我问过村长和支部书记，他们认为只要你有能力出去打工，村里就认为你有生活能力，不给你算低保。
I asked the village chief and the branch secretary if they thought that as long as you were able to go out to work, the village thought you had the ability to live.
花的药钱没算过，就是每月手里都不剩下钱了。
The cost of the medicine has not been calculated, even if there is no money left in hand every month.
我这眼睛右眼是失明的，还有一只也高度近视。
I am blind in my right eye, and one is also highly myopic.
2019年9月份的时候，忽然看东西感觉下雾似的。
In September 2019, I suddenly felt foggy when I looked at something.
去医院检查说是白内障，专家说做手术的话风险太大，因为只有一只眼睛有视力了，做完这只，如果看不见就完了。
Going to the hospital for a cataract, experts say the risk of surgery is too great, because there is only one eye with vision, to do this, if not to see the end.
后面也就没有做手术，我现在看东西就感觉眼前有哈气似的，上班看着前面的自行车是否放在那儿都看不清。
After the surgery, I now look at things like a breath, to see whether the front of the bicycle there can not be seen clearly.
2017年搬家后上班更远，每趟公交车间隔一小时，为了追公交车，我跟着别人跑，眼睛不好使撞到路边铁管上了，牙撞活动了，一年才缓过来。
After moving to work in 2017, an hour after each bus, I ran with the others to catch the bus, ran my eyes hard on the side of the road, crashed into the metal pipes, and recovered after a year.
不出门，我就有两个以前买的保暖口罩大年初一领导就说让我休息不上班了，啥时候上也不知道。
Do not go out, I have two previously bought warm masks on the first day of the leadership said let me rest do not go to work, when do not know.
社区从1月29号开始贴墙上通知了，让戴口罩，不让到处转悠，胡同里也有保安站岗，问你是哪儿的，有身份证吗？这周围人都变少了。
The community has been posting notices on the walls since January 29th, allowing masks to be worn and security guards posted around the Hutong. Ask where you are, do you have ID cards? There are fewer people around.
我们胡同门口有片空地堆着垃圾啥的，已经被人拿铁板挡上了，也没看到有人喷消毒液。
There is a vacant lot of garbage in front of our Hutong Hutong, which has been blocked with iron plates, and no one has seen spray of disinfectant.
▲ 刘兴租住的出租房的门口（拍摄于2019年暑期）我看手机新闻说，它这个病（新冠肺炎）都是通过呼吸、唾沫啥的传播，反正都注意点呗。
Liu Xing rented the door (shooting in the summer of 2019) I looked at the mobile phone news that the disease (New Crown Pneumonia) is through the transmission of breathing, saliva, all pay attention to the point.
现在周围人出来的很少了，都是戴口罩。
There are few people out there now, all wearing masks.
现在人也不到处串了。
People don't go around anymore.
我们附近没听说有隔离的，我就是看手机新闻知道的防护措施，出门戴口罩、勤洗手、尽量少接触人，别到人多的地方去。
We did not hear of isolation nearby, I just read the mobile phone news know the protective measures, go out wearing masks, wash hands, minimize contact with people, do not go to many places.
我自己有两个以前买的保暖的口罩，也很少跟人接触。
I have two warm masks I bought before, and I have little contact with people.
等我上班了再考虑买那种专用的口罩吧，我告诉孩子和他妈妈在家待着别出门，能不出尽量不出。
When I get to work, I'll think about buying a special mask. I'll tell him to stay at home with his mother.
现在这个病挺厉害的，上班时间也老是延长，一会说是初七，现在又说是初十，又说根据疫情发展再通知。
Now this very serious illness, the office time is always lengthened, one is said to be the seventh, and now said is the tenth, according to the outbreak of the disease to notify again.
我们这个个体单位也不像是国有的，不上班就没钱。
Our individual unit doesn't seem to be state-owned, and we don't have money when we don't work.
这也不是着急的事，得把心态摆好，不要紧张，注意身体。
This is not a matter of urgency, we have to put mind, not nervous, pay attention to the body.
不上班了就得吃老本，我们没钱吃啥老本啊这个疫情持续的时间长短不好说，观察一天是一天吧。
If we don't get to work, we'll have to eat what we don't have We don't have the money to eat Ben Well, this epidemic has been going on for so long It's hard to say that observing a day is a day.
不上班了就得吃老本，但我们没钱吃啥老本。
We'll have to eat our fill if we don't work, but we don't have the money.
疫情来的突然，一开始忽略了，现在才开始紧抓，我担心不上班没工资，没钱交学费。
The outbreak of the outbreak, initially ignored, now just began to grasp, I worry about not working without wages, no money to pay school fees.
我也想过如果这里一直不让回去上班，就找其他工作。
I also thought if I didn't get back to work, I'd look for another job.
但是现在还不能找，因为他还没说不要我，我们这个车管员的工作，说白了不是歪瓜裂枣就是病病殃殃，身体好的人没人干这个活。
But he can't find it yet, because he hasn't said no to me, and our job as a car supervisor, to put it bluntly, is either to twist dates or to get sick, and no one in good health does the job.
现在这个疫情即使多方打听找到活，也不能去上班，只能先了解信息。
Now the epidemic, even if asked to find work, can not go to work, only to find out the information.
我眼睛也不好，好多活我想干，人家还不要我。
My eyes are not good, I want to do a lot of work, people do not want me.
没交上学费，老师就不让进教室孩子学校的微信群从1月23号到现在，让每个学生天天报一次平安。
Students are not allowed to go to school without paying the tuition fee. From January 23 to the present, the school has a message for every student every day.
但啥时候上学老是说得等通知，网课啥的老师还没提过。
But when to go to school is always waiting for the notice, the network class teacher has not mentioned.
▲ 陪伴天使到家里陪伴刘兴的孩子（拍摄于2019年9月）老是不能去上班的话，孩子的学费我比较犯愁。
Children accompanying angels to Liu Xing at home (filmed in September 2019) are always unable to go to work, the children's school fees I am more worried.
之前有一次学费差一千块钱没交上，老师就不让孩子进教室，4天没进教室，后来跟别人借钱交上了才让进。
Before that, the teacher did not let the children into the classroom, four days did not enter the classroom, and then borrow money from others to pay the money to pay.
我想等孩子今年初中毕业后上大连读个职高去，那里有亲戚能照顾他。
I want to go to Dalian early this year after graduation, there are relatives to take care of him.
我要是在北京实在混不下去了就跟他妈妈回老家。
If I can't get along in Beijing, I'll go home with his mother.
▲陪伴天使到家里陪伴刘兴的孩子（拍摄于2019年9月）我跟孩子总说，要是想留在城里就得好好学习，才能找到好工作。
Accompanying angels at home with Liu Xing's children (filmed in September 2019) I always told my children that if I wanted to stay in town, I had to study hard to get a good job.
打工跟找正式工作是两码事。
A part-time job is not the same as a regular job.
要是正式工作的话，一天工作八小时，上班时间少，工资待遇还高，受法律保护，各方面都好。
If you work a full-time job, you work eight hours a day, work fewer hours, earn more, are protected by law, and do well in all respects.
临时工的话，说辞掉你就辞掉，你干到80岁、100岁都可能没有退休金。
If you quit a temp job, you might not have a pension until you were 80 or 100.
以前我总想着等他上班了，我就带着她妈妈再去找个工作，将来攒点钱给孩子成个家，现在看我这个身体也不行，也挣不了几个钱，将来只能靠孩子自己了。
I used to think that when he got to work, I would take her mother to find another job and save some money to start a family.
社会工作者手记与刘兴通完电话，总能感受到他对稳定生活的向往，尤其是对孩子的未来，希望孩子能好好学习，将来能找到一份正式工作，在城市里扎下根。
When social workers write down the phone with Liu Xing-tong, they can always feel his yearning for stable life, especially for their children's future, and hope that they can study hard and find a formal job and take root in the city.
但是对于一个夫妻二人都是残疾人的家庭来说，实现这个愿望又是何等的艰难。
But for a family where both husband and wife are disabled, how difficult it is to achieve this.
刘兴的视力虽然越来越不好，但是他用自己的方式努力维护着劳动的尊严，并且通过勤劳和耐心，尽力去做一个好员工、好丈夫和好父亲。
Although Liu Xing's vision is more and more bad, but he uses his own way to maintain the dignity of labor, and through hard work and patience, try to be a good employee, husband and father.
但疫情让他的工作和生活变得捉摸不定，稳定的生活和孩子美好的未来，似乎变成了奢望。
But the epidemic has left his job and life uncertain, and a stable life and a bright future for his children seem to have become wishful thinking.
