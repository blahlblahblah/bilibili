1月28日，宜昌市第一人民医院第三次派出5名护士支援新冠肺炎定点收治的机构——宜昌市第三人民医院，5位护士先后到达。
On January 28, the First People's Hospital of Yichang sent five nurses to support the Third People's Hospital of Yichang, the designated hospital for the treatment of Newcastle Pneumonia.
刘瀚和张禹就是本次增援团队中的两名成员。
Liu and Zhang Yu are two members of the reinforcement team.
此前他们在医院微信群聊内向上级表示：“志愿报名，随叫随到”，随后签下医院准备的“决战志愿书”，按下红手印。
"Volunteer registration, on call," they said to their superiors as they chatted in the hospital, then signed up for the "volunteer battle certificate" prepared by the hospital and pressed the red hand prints.
2020年的除夕夜，刘瀚在午夜12点从家乡坐车前往宜昌市，在颠簸了5个小时之后，于凌晨5点到达市三医院。
On New Year's Eve 2020, Liu took a bus from his hometown to Yichang City at 12: 00 midnight. After a bumpy five-hour ride, he arrived at City Three Hospital at 5 a.m.
他的前线增援旅程就此开始。
His frontline reinforcements began.
“缺氧”的防护服最让刘瀚不适应的是医院为每位工作人员配备的防护服。
"Hypoxia" of the protective clothing Liu most adapt to is the hospital for each staff member's protective clothing.
由于被安排在重症病房护理，他所在的科室启动了医疗三级防护。
Having been placed in intensive care, his unit initiated tertiary care.
医院设置“清洁区”“半污染区”“污染区”。
Hospitals set up "Clean Zone," "Half Contaminated Area" and "Contaminated Zone."
刘瀚每天在上班前，需在清洁区先穿工作服，再穿防护服，脸部戴好N95口罩和护目镜；到了半污染区还要再套一层隔离服，手套和鞋套都得套两层；直至把自己包裹得严严实实才能进入污染区的病房。
Liu wears overalls, protective clothing, N95 masks and goggles before going to work every day in the clean area. He has to put on another layer of protective clothing, gloves and shoes in the semi-polluted area until he is completely wrapped up in a hospital room in the polluted area.
一旦换上防护服，喝水、进食、去卫生间就都通通成了禁忌。
Once change protective clothing, drink water, eat, go toilet all become taboo.
一套衣物的成本大概在300元人民币左右，为了节省物资，医生和护士们在工作时间内都尽量不去更换衣物，避免浪费一整套防护服。
To save money, doctors and nurses try not to change clothes during working hours and waste a whole range of protective clothing.
“有什么生理需要都得强忍着，等到下班再去解决。
"" Any physiological needs have to be kept in check until after work.
”刘瀚说。
"said Liu.
有些医生和护士到了工作后半期甚至不得已逼自己不停运动，等到额头和后背都已经被汗液沁湿，再全身心地投入到工作中，也就不会想去卫生间了。
Some doctors and nurses even have to force themselves to keep moving in the second half of their working lives, wait until their foreheads and backs are moist with sweat, then devote themselves to their work, and they won't want to go to the bathroom.
在工作刚开始的那几天，由于前线人手不足，每位护士都要加班加点连续医院15、6个小时。
During the first few days of work, each nurse had to work 15 to 6 hours in a continuous hospital because of a shortage of front-line staff.
“防护服太闷太勒了，一开始会心慌、胸闷、气喘，甚至感觉恶心呕吐……什么症状都来了。
"The suit is too stuffy, and at first you get nervous, chest tightness, wheezing and even nausea and vomiting... and all the symptoms come.
”刘瀚说，“我还算好的了，有些女护士（在这种高强度工作下）撑不住就晕倒了。
"I'm all right," Liu said. "Some female nurses fainted when they couldn't hold out [in this high-intensity job].
”即便如此，晕倒了的女护士们也没法立即下班或放假。
Even so, the female nurses who fainted were unable to leave work or vacation immediately.
“他们坐这稍微休息一下就又得继续工作，人手实在是不够，病人又那么多。
"They're going to have to go on with their work after a little rest. It's just not enough. There are so many patients.
”刘瀚说。
"said Liu.
除了防护服，护目镜也让医生护士们叫苦不迭。
In addition to protective clothing, goggles make doctors and nurses cry bitterly.
医务人员们呼出的气流在透明护目镜上液化成一片薄雾，影响视线。
The air exhaled by the medical staff liquefied into a thin mist over the transparent goggles, affecting the line of sight.
不仅如此，护目镜长期架在脸上的后果是，鼻梁、面颊、额头都会被勒出压痕甚至血泡。
Not only that, the long-term effects of goggles on the face is that the nose, cheeks, forehead will be strangled even blood blister.
“我的血泡到现在都没消退。
"My blood blister hasn't gone away yet.
”刘瀚说，他还会在下班后戏称自己的同事为：“小龙女”，因为护目镜每天都会在同事额头两侧勒出对称的两个小鼓包。
"Liu said he would also joke about his colleagues as" dragon girls "after work because goggles strangle symmetrical small bulbs on each side of his forehead every day.
“防护服不光是在保护自己也是在保护病人啊，如果你倒下了，就没有人去照顾危重患者了。
"Protective clothing is not only about protecting yourself, it's also about protecting the sick. If you fall, no one will take care of the critically ill.
”刘瀚说。
"said Liu.
他身边也并非没有感染新冠肺炎的同事，对于在一线工作的医务人员来说，这是难以全然规避的风险。
He is not without colleagues with pneumonia, a risk that is difficult to avoid for front-line medical staff.
“我也担心，但我还年轻，抵抗力好。
"I'm worried too, but I'm young and resistant.
”他说。
'he said.
病房里的患者张禹是和刘瀚同批来增援的护士，被安排在了轻症病房。
The patient in the ward, Zhang Yu, was sent to the hospital ward with Liu Hantong's reinforcements.
张禹曾遇到过一个老军人，本身患有糖尿病，感染新冠肺炎后病情加重甚至出现一些老年痴呆的症状。
Zhang Yu had encountered an old soldier, himself suffering from diabetes, after the new crown pneumonia aggravation and even some Alzheimer's symptoms.
“我们本以为他意识清醒，后来发现送去的饭一口没吃，睡觉不脱鞋子，老战友的电话他也不接。
"We thought he was wide-awake, and then we found that the food he sent us didn't eat, that he didn't take off his shoes and that he didn't answer his old comrades' calls.
”张禹回忆说。
"said Zhang Yu.
新冠肺炎对这位病患的心理打击是超乎想象的。
The psychological impact of the new crown pneumonia on the patient was beyond imagination.
他对自己的病情不理解，也拒绝用药输液。
He did not understand his condition and refused to be given an infusion.
在他的认知里，国力强盛医疗发达，这样大规模的疫情根本不可能存在，他又在毫无意识的情况下被家人送入医院隔离。
In his mind, the country is strong and well-developed in health care, such a large-scale epidemic simply could not exist, and he was unconsciously sent to hospital isolation by his family.
“他以为家里人把他抛弃了。
He thought he had been abandoned by his family.
”张禹说，“接下来就是一口一口喂饭，告诉他这种病毒和非典一样有传染性所以要住院，哄他说做了CT如果好了就能回家。
"The next step is to feed him mouthful by mouthful and tell him that the virus is as contagious as SARS so he has to be hospitalized and coax him into saying he has a CT and can go home if he gets well.
他会对我们说谢谢，饭也知道吃，表明他还是有意识的。
He would say thank you to us, and rice would know to eat, indicating that he was conscious.
”所幸这位老军人的病情仍是可控的，会随着时间慢慢好转。
Fortunately, the old soldier's condition was manageable and would slowly improve over time.
而刘瀚所在的重症病房，状况就没有那么乐观了。
And Liu's intensive-care unit is in a less sanguine state.
重症科室楼层内，躺满了或昏迷或极度衰弱的病人。
On the floors of the intensive care unit, patients were lying in a coma or extremely weak condition.
其中，多数已经达到了生活不能自理、依靠输液和呼吸机来维持生命体征的程度。
Most of them have reached the point where they are unable to look after themselves and rely on transfusions and respirators to maintain vital signs.
因此，医疗护理以外，病人每日的生活护理也成了刘瀚的工作任务。
Therefore, in addition to medical care, daily life care for patients has become Liu's task.
口腔护理和会阴护理是护士们上班的第一个任务，一整天呼吸器的气管插管、打针输液、包括血液的氧饱和度等各项检测在内，都需要时时看护和纪录。
Oral care and perineal care are the nurses' first task at work, and all tests, including endotracheal intubation, injection infusion, including oxygen saturation of the blood, need constant care and recording.
到了饭点要给病人喂饭，有些特殊病人无法进食，则需要通过直接向胃部输液来保证每日的营养。
At meal time to feed the patient, some special patients can not eat, need to be directly to the stomach infusion to ensure daily nutrition.
为了保证氧饱和度在正常水平，护士们每隔一到两个小时就要为患者翻身，以避免长期卧床导致肺部感染加重。
To ensure normal oxygen saturation, nurses turn over the patient every one to two hours to avoid a prolonged bed-ridden lung infection.
“这些危重病人随时会有生命危险。
"These critically ill people are in immediate danger.
”刘瀚说，“有时候发现，我们喂的饭病人原本只能吃半碗，后来能吃一整碗了，我们就很欣慰。
"Sometimes we find ourselves feeding a half-bowl of rice to a patient, and then eating a whole bowl, we're glad," Liu said.
”令刘瀚印象深刻的是一个个头高大的男性病患，他在住院十天后变得很焦虑很急躁，甚至强硬地不配合护士的治疗，拒绝服药拒绝输液。
What makes Liu impressive is a tall male patient who has become anxious and irritable after 10 days in hospital, even refusing to take medicine to refuse the infusion, even when he refused to cooperate with the nurse.
每当这种时候，刘瀚就会先找心理医生进行干预，再打电话给病人家属，让家属安抚病人的情绪。
At such times, Liu would first call a psychiatrist to intervene and then call the patient's family to reassure the patient.
“要哄着他，告诉他有人吃了药就痊愈了，他就会自己把药吃下去。
"" Teach him that someone has taken the medicine and is cured, and he will take it himself.
”刘瀚说，“他身体病重，精神压力也很大，心理状态就会像孩子一样，比较情绪化。
"He is very ill and mentally stressed, and his mental state will be more emotional like that of a child," Liu said.
”病患的恐惧与日俱增也和更新的确诊、死亡人数密不可分。
The growing fear of patients is also tied to the number of new diagnoses and deaths.
宜昌市官方每天会发布出院率、死亡率等数据，这些数据无形之中都在攻击着重症病人们的心理防线。
Officials in Yichang will release discharge rates and death rates every day, and these figures are implicitly attacking the psychological defense line of the seriously ill.
“他怕下一个（离去）的会是他。
"He's afraid it'll be him next.
”刘瀚说，“但好转的也有，那对我们来说就像奇迹一样，从身体插满管子到慢慢康复。
"But there have been improvements," Liu said. "It's like miracles for us, from plugging pipes into our bodies to slowly healing.
”尽管如此，没有哪个医生能保证所有昏迷病人的苏醒，都能像春天一样如期而至。
Still, no doctor can guarantee that all coma patients will wake up as regularly as spring.
在全国疫情结束后，仍可能有尚未恢复意识的病患，躺在重症病房内。
After the end of the national epidemic, there may still be patients who have not regained consciousness, lying in the intensive care unit.
两点一线的生活自从来支援，刘瀚和张禹就过上了医院、酒店两点一线的生活。
Since the two-point line of life has come to support, Liu and Zhang Yu on the hospital, hotel line two life.
从各地来增援的医生护士都被安排在了离宜昌市第三人民医院不远的酒店里，食宿统一解决。
Additional doctors and nurses from all over the city were placed in a hotel not far from the Third People's Hospital in Yichang City.
为了避免意外，他们也必须与外界隔离，不能与任何亲友接触。
In order to avoid accidents, they must also be isolated from the outside world and have no contact with any relatives or friends.
后期人手相对充足，医院就采用了4小时一班的排班制，每位护士每天被安排了两个班的工作。
The hospital was relatively well staffed in the latter part of the year, using a four-hour shift system in which each nurse was assigned two shifts a day.
刘瀚和张禹每天在酒店醒来，起床后就得乘坐专门的公交车前往医院，紧接着消毒、洗手，再换上厚实的防护服，在极度闷热的环境里，开始将近8小时的工作。
After waking up at the hotel, Liu and Zhang Yu had to take a special bus to the hospital, then disinfect, wash their hands, change into thick protective clothing, and start working for nearly 8 hours in the extremely hot environment.
新冠肺炎传染性强，医院平时的保洁人员也不再上班，日常保洁工作也就落到了医生护士们的肩头。
New crown pneumonia is infectious, the hospital's normal cleaning staff also no longer work, the daily cleaning work also fell on the shoulders of the doctors and nurses.
下班后除了酒店，其他地方也不允许去，刘瀚形象地说：“像坐月子一样。
"You are not allowed to go anywhere except the hotel after work," Liu said vividly.
”张禹说：“这样的日子不知道什么时候才能结束。
"I don't know when it will end," Zhang Yu said.
住院的人越来越多了，特别难过的是，很多是一家人被陆陆续续送进医院的。
The number of hospitalizations is increasing, and it is particularly distressing that many families continue to be admitted to hospitals.
”他记得有个家庭，起先只有妈妈感染住院了，她的情绪原本很稳定。
He remembered a family in which only his mother had been hospitalized with an infection at first, and she was in a stable mood.
过了几天她的孩子也被家里人送过来住院了，那位妈妈心态一瞬间就失衡了。
A few days later her child was sent to the hospital by her family, and the mother's state of mind was out of balance for a moment.
家属给她打电话告知孩子已经送到病房楼下了，没办法送上来。
The family called her and told her that the child had been taken downstairs and could not be delivered.
而她又没法离开污染区下楼去接孩子，她就焦急地委托护士把孩子送到同一个病房来方便她照顾。
Unable to leave the contaminated area and go downstairs to pick up the child, she anxiously asked the nurse to take the child to the same ward for her care.
接到孩子后，她把孩子紧紧地抱在怀里，不停地烧开水放凉后喂孩子喝。
Upon receiving the child, she held the child tightly in her arms and kept boiling water to cool it and feed it to the child.
压力很大，他们仍能保持乐观的心态。
They are under a lot of pressure to remain upbeat.
刘瀚说：“我没结婚，家里还有个姐姐，我也年轻身体好，没问题的。
"I'm not married, I have a sister at home and I am young and healthy," Liu said.
”给家人打电话报平安，是刘瀚每日必做的一件事。
It is a daily necessity for Liu to call his family to tell him he is safe.
