interviewee: + + + + + + + + + + + the Beijing News reporter, editor-in-law, has a feeling of being on the front line, with about 4275 words in this article. It takes about eight minutes to read the full text in protective clothing and enter the intensive care unit.
她既不是医生，也不是护士，而是武汉市江汉区城管局的一名环卫工。
She was neither a doctor nor a nurse, but an sanitation worker at the Wuhan City Administration of Jianghan.
往常每个工作日，满彩美会和同事一起，将8.4公里长的中山大道清扫干净。
Usually every weekday, the colorful will work with colleagues to 8. 4 km of Zhongshan Avenue clean.
2020年农历大年初一，她照常去单位上班。
On the first day of the 2020 Chinese New Year, she goes to work as usual.
开会时得知附近医院急需人手做保洁，局里号召员工们自愿参加。
The meeting learned that the nearby hospital is in urgent need of hands-on cleaning, the bureau called on staff to volunteer.
35岁的满彩美悄悄报了名。
The 35-year-old has quietly made her name.
“说不害怕是假的，就觉得在队伍里我也算年轻，这个工作需要有人站出来。
'To say no is false, and I feel young in the company, and the work requires someone to stand up for it.
”接受完防护培训，她和十几名同事被派往武汉市红十字会医院，当天夜里便清理出100多桶垃圾。
After receiving protection training, she and a dozen colleagues were sent to Wuhan Red Cross Hospital, where they cleared more than 100 barrels of garbage that night.
医院的人透露，由于缺少保洁，那些垃圾已经堆了三四天未处理。
Hospital officials say the rubbish has been piling up for three or four days because of lack of cleanliness.
疫情暴发后的武汉，不止一家医院出现保洁人员紧缺的情况。
After the outbreak of Wuhan, more than one hospital in the shortage of cleaning personnel.
在人手告急的情况下，江汉、江岸、汉南等多个区的城管部门采取行动，号召员工支援保洁工作。
In the case of a human resources crisis, Jianghan, riverbank, Hannan and other urban management departments to take action, call on staff to support cleaning work.
一批又一批环卫工人告别街头，开始忙碌在武汉市的各家定点医院和方舱里。
Groups of sanitation workers bid farewell to the streets, began to busy in Wuhan City's designated hospitals and cabins.
从反光衣到防护服工作调整后，满彩美身上最明显的变化在于衣服。
After adjusting from the reflective clothing to the protective clothing work, the most obvious change on the body is the clothes.
上街清扫时，为了提醒来往车辆避让，她需要穿着醒目的橙色工作服，上衣和裤子上缝有银色反光条。
For street sweeping, to warn off traffic, she needs to wear a bold orange smock with silver stripes on her jacket and trousers.
到了医院，她改用全身防护服武装自己，“就像医护人员穿的一样。
At the hospital, she armed herself with full-length protective clothing, "just as paramedics wear.
”武汉市红十字会医院内，满彩美在转运垃圾。
"Wuhan Red Cross Hospital, colorful in the transfer of garbage.
受访者供图事实上，环卫工进医院前所接受的培训，最主要的内容就是学习如何穿脱防护服。
In fact, the most important part of the training received by the sanitary workers before they enter the hospital is how to wear protective clothing.
满彩美很快熟悉了整套流程。
It quickly familiarized itself with the whole process.
进病房楼之前，她需要提前换上防护服，戴上手套、口罩和面罩，工作期间遇到任何情况，也不会贸然打开防护服。
Before entering the ward building, she needed to change into protective clothing ahead of time, wearing gloves, masks and masks.
结束后仍要按照流程一层层脱掉，同时做好消毒。
After the end of the process should still be taken off layer by layer, while doing good disinfection.
流程的繁琐，不是所有环卫工都能理解。
The complexity of the process, not all sanitation workers can understand.
刚来医院的时候，一位50多岁的环卫工在病区脱了防护服上厕所，出来后又穿上。
When he first arrived at the hospital, a 50-year-old sanitation worker took off his clothes and went to the toilet in the sick area.
吓得满彩美紧张了好一阵儿，叮嘱对方这样做很危险。
Terrified and nervous for a long time, said the other side to do so is dangerous.
按照防护要求，保洁员中途上厕所需要走出病房楼，脱掉防护服做完消毒后才能去，返回时需要再换上一身新的防护服。
In accordance with the protection requirements, cleaners on the way to the toilet needs to leave the ward building, take off protective clothing after disinfection before returning to the need to change into a new protective clothing.
为了省下这套防护服，满彩美起床之后便开始控制饮水，基本能做到工作4个小时不上厕所。
In order to save this suit, the beautiful wake-up began to control drinking water, basically able to work four hours do not go to the toilet.
像她一样，大多数保洁员保持着一天两套防护服的消耗量，只在中午吃饭时更换一次。
Like her, most cleaners consume two sets of protective clothing a day and only change them at lunchtime.
物资有多紧缺，身在医院的她们感受得到。
How scarce were the supplies they felt in the hospital.
满彩美发现，每天领到手的防护服并不是固定样式，前一天是纯白，第二天有可能是带条纹的，每天穿的是来自不同厂家不同批次的货。
She found that the protective clothing she received every day was not a fixed pattern, that the previous day was pure white and that the next day it was likely to be striped, wearing different batches of goods from different manufacturers.
“所以我们也想帮医生节省点，能省一件是一件。
"So we also want to save the doctors a little bit. One thing.
”做惯了街头清扫，满彩美反倒觉得医院保洁的工作强度更大。
Being used to sweeping the streets, the hospital felt that cleaning was more of a job.
在这里，一些自动化设备难以使用，只能靠人力解决。
Here, some automation equipment is difficult to use and can only be solved by manpower.
“再加上医院开着空调，我们又要穿防护服，干完活经常全身是汗。
"Plus, the hospital has an air conditioner on and we have to wear protective clothing.
”和她相比，安全员李佳的不适感要强烈些。
Compared with her, Jia Li, the safety officer, felt more uncomfortable.
作为武汉国际会展中心方舱医院的一名保洁领班，李佳主要负责协调调度班组的保洁员，确保垃圾到达指定的转运车上。
As a cleaning foreman at the Fang Cao Hospital of Wuhan International Convention and Exhibition Center, Li Jia is mainly responsible for coordinating the cleaners on the shift team to ensure that the refuse reaches the designated transporter.
他大多数时间是在方舱外协调指挥，但基本上每天都要进去忙活几个小时。
He co-ordinates most of the time outside the cabin, but basically has to go in and work for hours every day.
“队员们吃饭的时候，我就得进去帮他们盯着。
"I had to go in and stare when the team was eating.
一旦进去事情就比较多，本来是20个人做的事，这时候需要我一个人做。
Once you get in there, it's more of a 20-person task, and it's up to me to do it alone.
”由于鼻炎严重，每次穿好防护服、扎严口罩，李佳总觉得不能正常呼吸。
Because of her severe rhinitis, Li felt unable to breathe normally, wearing protective clothing and a strict mask every time.
鼻涕流下来，他也不能擦，只能等工作结束后再清理。
His nose was running down and he could not wipe it. He would have to wait until the work was done.
由于天天都要用酒精消毒，同班组的一些人还出现了皮肤不适的症状。
As a result of the daily use of alcohol sterilization, some people in the squad also developed symptoms of skin discomfort.
“没什么不能接受的”方舱启动的前一天，李佳就已经进驻。
Li Jia had been in the cabin the day before "nothing unacceptable" had started.
那天晚上，他从九点一直忙活到第二天凌晨五点半。
That night he was busy from nine o'clock till half past five the next morning.
回定点酒店眯了不到一个小时，又赶在七点左右回到方舱，继续工作到下午四点。
After squinting for less than an hour, he returned to the cabin around seven o'clock and continued to work until four in the afternoon.
李佳在方舱医院的抗疫海报前留了张工作照。
Li Jia left a job photo in front of the anti-epidemic poster at Fang She Hospital.
受访者供图李佳说，在病区保洁，除了打扫卫生，遇到其他事也要管。
The interviewee told Tu Li Jia that keeping clean in the sick area should be taken care of in addition to cleaning up.
比如病人吐了，他要拿拖把去清理；房顶漏水，他要把地拖干，湿掉的被子全部拿出去换新；离开方舱之前，还要顺手拖几桶垃圾出来。
For example, if the patient vomits, he will take a mop to clean it; the roof leaks, he will drag the floor dry, the wet quilt will be taken out and replaced; and before he leaves the cabin, he will drag out buckets of garbage.
在城管工作时，李佳负责各类车辆的运行安全，遇到突发事故及时处理。
In the city management work, Li Jia is responsible for the safety of all types of vehicles, sudden accidents in a timely manner.
如今，他需要面对清理呕吐物这类脏活，但已经顾不上在意。
Now, he has to face the dirty work of cleaning up vomit, but he has ignored it.
“到了现在到这种情况，没什么不能接受的。
"There is nothing unacceptable in this state of affairs.
”与方舱医院主要收治轻症患者不同，满彩美面对的是一间间隔离病房，里面住有病情不一的新型肺炎确诊病患。
Unlike the main patients admitted to the Fang Cao Hospital, the hospital is a one-room isolation ward housing patients diagnosed with various types of new pneumonia.
她心里多少有些压力，工作时经常自我开导。
She was more or less stressed and often self-taught at work.
“心里东想西想的，那肯定会害怕，我总是往好的方面想。
"If I think about it, I'm afraid of it. I always think of the good.
”满彩美说自己尽量保持着平常心。
"Maggie said she was trying to stay normal.
清理垃圾、扫地拖地，按照顺序逐步进行。
Clean up the rubbish and sweep the floor. Proceed step by step.
碰见病人咳嗽，也不会刻意去回避。
If you encounter a patient coughing, you will not try to avoid it.
有病人因为打吊针没办法移动，请她帮忙把饭盒收拾一下，她也从不拒绝。
One of the patients could not move because of the needle, asked her to help clean up the lunch box, she never refused.
一次清扫病房时，一位老年患者主动和满彩美聊天，抱怨有些病人不注意卫生，说保洁员很辛苦，病人应该体谅。
When cleaning a ward, an elderly patient took the initiative to chat with colorful, complaining that some patients do not pay attention to hygiene, that cleaners are very hard, patients should be considerate.
听到这番话，满彩美心里多了几分暖意。
Hearing these words, I felt a little warm in my heart.
同样的关心，她也在医护人员身上感受过。
She felt the same concern about the paramedics.
刚来的时候，一位护士询问她是否是来帮忙的，嘱咐她和同事一定要注意安全，做好防护。
When she arrived, a nurse asked her if she had come to help. She told her and her colleagues to be careful and protective.
其余时间，她们各忙各的，几乎没什么交流。
For the rest of the time, they were busy and had little communication.
我们不做谁来做？按照原计划，在武汉市红十字会医院工作7天后，满彩美需要隔离14天。
According to the original plan, after seven days at Wuhan Red Cross Hospital, we had to spend 14 days in isolation.
但仅仅过了3天，她再次接到通知，前往新建好的方舱医院做保洁。
But only three days later, she was again notified to clean the new cabin hospital.
“还是要进到病区，就暂时不需要隔离了。
'Still going into the sick zone, you won't need isolation for a while.
”从大年初一到现在，满彩美一直住在单位安排的酒店里，没和家人见过面。
"From the New Year's Day to the present, Caimei has been living in the hotel arranged by the unit, and has not met with their families.
每天结束工作之后，她习惯打视频电话报个平安，看一看丈夫和孩子。
At the end of each day, she used to make a video phone call to report safety, take a look at her husband and children.
去方舱的前一天，满彩美把情况如实告知孩子，说自己回不了家了，要重新换个位置上班。
The day before we went to the cabin, we told our children that we could not go home and had to relocate to another position.
“孩子问我，为什么又要你去，为什么不换别人？”满彩美只能说其他人也在岗位上忙事情，再加上14天隔离期未到，她本来也不能回家。
"The child asked me why I wanted you to go, why not change someone else?" The beauty could only say that others were busy with their jobs, and that she could not have returned home before the 14-day isolation period was over.
“这个是我们的工作，不可能不去，我们不做谁来做？”一同在方舱医院做清洁的还有60岁的范贤平。
"This is our job, can't go, we don't do who do it?" Together in the cabin hospital cleaning Fan Xianping, 60.
得知医院需要人手做保洁，只剩下几个月就退休的他也报了名。
Knowing that the hospital needed hands-on cleaning, only a few months to retire from his job.
儿女听说后和他吵了起来，“他们问我这么大年纪了，还做这种活儿干啥。
When the children heard about it, they quarreled with him. "They asked me what I was doing at my age.
反对也没办法，我是党员，这种关键时刻起码要起带头作用吧。
No way to oppose, I am a party member, such a critical moment to at least play a leading role.
”谈到自愿报名的初衷，李佳的回答同样很简单，“我也做点贡献，毕竟当过兵。
As for the original intention of volunteering, Li Jia's answer was equally simple: "I made a contribution, after all.
”进入方舱工作的第四天，李佳迎来了36岁生日。
"On the fourth day of working in the cabin, Li Jia celebrated her 36th birthday.
鼠年是他的本命年。
The Year of the Rat is his age.
生日这天，他却连老婆孩子的面也没见着。
On his birthday, he did not even see his wife and children.
得知他生日，队长送来两个小蛋糕，即便生日过得有些简单，李佳已经觉得很满足。
Knowing his birthday, the captain sent two small cakes, even though the birthday passed a little simple, Li Jia already felt very satisfied.
忙完打开手机，他看到了女儿准备的礼物。
Busy to open the phone, he saw her daughter prepared a gift.
那是用橡皮泥捏成的彩色小蛋糕，女儿捧在手心里，妻子给拍了张照片。
It was a small, colored cake made of plaster. My daughter held it in her hand. My wife took a picture.
“女儿早上醒了抱着娃娃自言自语，说爸爸一个月都不能回，难道我还高兴吗？爸爸是我唯一喜欢抱的人。
'Am I glad my daughter soliloquized in the morning, holding the doll in her arms, that papa will not return for a monthDaddy is the only one I like.
”收到妻子发来的这段话，李佳只回了五个字：爸爸在吃苦。
"Li Jia only answered five words when she received the message from her wife:" Dad is suffering.
连续几天见不到家人后，李佳还是有些担心。
After several days without seeing her family, Li Jia was still a little worried.
他的妻子也在城管系统工作，有着4个月的身孕，还要照顾5岁的大女儿。
His wife, who also works in the city management system, is four months pregnant and cares for her five-year-old daughter.
丈夫不在家，她只能带上孩子去单位上班。
Her husband was not at home, so she had to take her children to work.
年前，一家人搬了新家，孩子的幼儿园也换了离家更近的。
A year ago, the family moved to a new home and the children's kindergarten moved closer to home.
李佳原本计划过完年就请年假，带老婆孩子出去旅旅游。
Li Jia had planned to take annual leave and travel with his wife and children after the New Year.
想着孩子快上小学，妻子也快生二胎了，以后很难再有这样的空窗期。
Think of the children will soon go to primary school, his wife will soon have two children, it is difficult to have such a window period.
却没想到，疫情暴发打乱了所有计划。
Unexpectedly, the outbreak disrupted all plans.
有人骂，有人谢让李佳担心的还有岳父岳母。
Some people scolded, some let Li Jia worry about his father-in-law mother-in-law.
两位老人已经连续发烧十几天，不久前去医院照过CT，医生看完，觉得不太像新型肺炎，告知需要试剂盒才能确定。
Two old people have had a fever for more than 10 days, recently went to the hospital for a CT scan, doctors see, do not feel like a new pneumonia, told the need to test kits to determine.
由于回不了家，过去一段时间，李佳只能通过电话关注着老人的情况。
Unable to return home, Li Jia had to pay attention to the old man by telephone for some time.
在方舱医院，他偶尔也会观察玻璃门后面的病患。
At the cabin hospital, he occasionally looked at patients behind glass doors.
那些心态好的病人，有的看书，有的跟着护士做操。
Those with good mental attitude, some read books, some do exercises with nurses.
“我只希望他们快点好起来，疫情快点过去。
"I just want them to get better soon and get over it quickly.
”范贤平说，容量240升的垃圾桶，他们每天要处理300桶，早中晚各清扫一次。
Fan said the 240-litre dustbin had to deal with 300 barrels a day and be cleaned up in the morning and again in the evening.
除了防护服等医疗垃圾，最主要的还是饭盒、牛奶瓶和用过的纸巾。
In addition to medical waste such as protective clothing, the most important are rice boxes, milk bottles and used tissues.
清扫完厕所，污物都要集纳消毒后由专人运出。
After cleaning the toilet, the dirt should be collected and disinfected and then transported by hand.
由于全天都待在方舱内，范贤平与病人的接触更多，来到方舱的前五天，他就被病人骂过三次。
Because he stayed in the square cabin all day, Fan Xianping had more contact with the patient. He was scolded three times by the patient in the first five days.
有病人找到他，想让他进病房收拾垃圾，但医生交代过，病房里的人症状稍重，不允许保洁人员进入。
A patient came to him and wanted him to go into the ward to pick up the rubbish, but the doctor told him that the patients in the ward had some serious symptoms and were not allowed to enter.
“虽然说防护服都是一样的，但是我们没他们专业，一个环节搞不好就有可能感染。
"Although the protective clothing is the same, but we do not have their professional, a link may not be able to infect.
”范贤平没按对方要求进病房，过了一刻钟，对方突然开始骂脏话。
Fan Xianping did not enter the ward as requested, and a quarter of an hour later the other party suddenly started swearing.
江汉城管的一位职工在防护服上写下“我是武汉伢”。
A worker in the Jianghan city administration wrote "A so Wuhan" on his protective clothing.
受访者供图另外两次被骂是因为消毒的事。
Respondents were also scolded twice for disinfection.
有病重患者转移到火神山医院后，旁边的病人想让工作人员来消毒。
After a serious patient was transferred to Mount Huoshen Hospital, the patient next to him wanted the staff to disinfect him.
范贤平告诉他们，医院有专门的消毒人员，他用的是消毒液只能拖地，没办法直接给床位做消毒。
Fan Xianping told them that the hospital has a special disinfectant, he used disinfectant can only mop the floor, there is no way to disinfect the bed directly.
一番解释之后，对方还是不理解，责备之后撂了几句脏话。
After some explanation, the other side still did not understand, after the blame put a few dirty words.
遇到这种情况，范贤平只能自我宽慰，“他们也可能不是针对我，就是在里面待的时间长了，心态不好。
In this situation, Fan Xianping can only comfort himself, "they may either be against me, or stay in the long-term, bad mood.
”他不是没有收到过感谢。
He did not fail to receive thanks.
一次，有病人吐在了隔离区门口，他赶忙跑去收拾。
Once, a patient spat in the quarantine area door, he hurriedly ran to clean up.
旁边的一位病人见了直说谢谢，解释说他们也不是故意吐在地上，只是生病了没有法控制。
When a nearby patient saw her and said thank you, she explained that they did not spit on the ground deliberately, but were ill and uncontrollable.
方舱里的这些情况，计鹏飞都看在眼里。
Now, all these things in the cabin were visible to Meng.
他是江汉城管派驻在方舱医院的现场负责人之一。
He is one of the on-site managers of JiangHan City Guards stationed in Fang Cao Hospital.
发现保洁员被骂的情况后，只能边安抚边作解释，“毕竟他们得了这个病，心态肯定没那么好，还是要多体谅一下。
After all, they have the disease, the mentality is certainly not so good, or to make allowances for it.
”有时候，他也能理解病人。
"Sometimes he could understand the patient.
“例如转运垃圾的时候，保洁员需要拖着垃圾箱从病区穿过，那个轮子产生的噪音比较大，可能会吵到他们。
"For example, when transferring waste, cleaners have to drag bins through the sick area. That wheel makes a lot of noise and can be noisy.
”但条件有限，他没办法改变设备，只能建议大家尽量减少摩擦。
But conditions were limited and he could not change the equipment, so he advised people to minimize friction.
在他看来，大部分病人还是比较友好，清扫、消毒的时候都会感谢，保洁员们听了会觉得很满足。
In his view, most patients are still relatively friendly, cleaning, disinfection will be grateful when the cleaners will feel very satisfied.
他也提到，个别患者并不是特别在意卫生，导致清扫之后难以保持，因此他十分理解保洁员。
He also mentioned that individual patients do not pay special attention to hygiene, which makes cleaning difficult to maintain, so he understands cleaners well.
没有一个人退出计鹏飞介绍，目前江汉城管共有5支清扫队伍、共计120名环卫工人在武汉国际会展中心方舱做保洁。
At present, there are 5 cleaning teams and 120 sanitary workers in the cabin of Wuhan International Convention and Exhibition Center.
其中既有编制人员也有合同工，每个队分3个班组，一个班组7人左右，每天三班倒。
There are both establishment and contract workers, with each team divided into three shifts of about seven persons per team, working three shifts per day.
此外还有一些领班负责管理协调工作，他们要从早上7点一直忙到晚上11点。
In addition, there are a number of foremen in charge of coordination, who are busy from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m.
城管局安排专车，每日接送环卫工上下班。
The city authorities arrange special buses to transport sanitation workers to and from work every day.
受访者供图带着这么多人在方舱医院工作，计鹏飞最担心的还是安全问题。
The respondents wanted to bring so many people to work in the cabin hospital. Peng Fei's biggest concern was safety.
每天进场作业前，他会安排领队现场监督队员们穿好防护服。
Every day before entering the work, he will arrange the team leader on the spot to supervise the team wearing protective clothing.
出来的时候还会再检查一遍。
I'll check it again when I get out.
早晚进出酒店，也有专人量体温。
Morning and evening in and out of the hotel, also have temperature.
“如果队员有哪里不舒服，会得到及时处理。
"If a team member has any discomfort, it will be dealt with in a timely manner.
”尽管已经强调了很多遍，计鹏飞还是会每天讲解一次防护要求。
"Now, even though he had emphasized it many times, he would explain the protection requirement once a day.
他知道环卫工的文化水平不是很高，很多事情说一遍可能听不懂，所以尽可能用大白话告诉他们应该怎么做。
He knew that sanitation workers are not very educated, many things said may not understand, so try to tell them what to do in plain English.
在他看来，一线工人是最辛苦的。
The front-line workers, in his view, were the hardest.
城管局每天会给队员一人500元的特殊补贴。
A special subsidy of $500 is payable to a member of the Board every day.
供应的午饭、晚饭也和病人一样，外加一瓶牛奶。
Lunch and dinner were served as well as a patient, plus a bottle of milk.
由专人从外面做好送进方舱区。
Send it to the cabin area from the outside.
作为管理人员，计鹏飞最感动的还是一线保洁员的坚持，他说，到目前为止，没有一名员工找到他要求退出。
As a manager, Qi Peng-fei is most moved by the insistence of the front-line cleaners, he said, so far, not a single employee has found him to quit.
“他们说生在武汉、长在武汉，现在这个情况出份力也是应该的。
"They say that they were born and raised in Wuhan, and it is right that this should be the case.
医护人员都在前面顶着，我们也一样。
The paramedics are at the front, and so are we.
”满彩美也一直在继续工作。
"And she continued to work.
有时候干累了，她会和同事们聊聊天，互相安慰之后继续干活。
Sometimes, when she was tired, she would talk to her colleagues, comfort each other and go on working.
“我觉得大家都蛮勇敢的，没有一个人退缩。
"I think everyone was brave, and not a soul flinched.
