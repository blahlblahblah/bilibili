来源：财联社作者：史正丞“ 据媒体报道，国际奥委会对于历届主办城市的投资大约在10亿美元上下，为此向保险公司投保约8亿美元保额，按照2-3%的保费来计算，IOC为东京奥运支付的保险费用最多不超过2400万美元。
According to media reports, the IOC has invested about US $1 billion in the host cities, and has insured the insurance companies for about US $800 million. On the basis of the premiums of 2-3%, the IOC paid not more than US $24 million for the Tokyo Olympics.
”本周国际奥委会委员迪克·庞德有关“若五月疫情不结束，东京奥运会被取消”的言论引发了国际社会的轩然大波。
This week IOC member Dick Pound caused international uproar by saying that "if the May outbreak does not end, the Tokyo Olympics will be cancelled."
虽然日本政府、国际奥委会均表示东京奥运的筹办工作继续按计划推进，世卫组织也表态称短期内不适合对取消奥运作出决定。
While the Japanese government and the International Olympic Committee have said preparations for the Tokyo Olympics continue on schedule, WHO has said it is not in a position to decide on its decision in the short term.
但受到近几日全球多国确诊病例激增的影响，金融市场已经开始考虑潜在的风险了。
But financial markets have begun to consider potential risks, influenced by the surge in confirmed cases in many countries around the world in recent days.
首当其冲的，就是保险行业将会付出的数十亿美元赔偿。
First, the insurance industry will pay billions of dollars in compensation.
据媒体报道，国际奥委会对于历届主办城市的投资大约在10亿美元上下，为此向保险公司投保约8亿美元保额，按照2-3%的保费来计算，IOC为东京奥运支付的保险费用最多不超过2400万美元。
According to media reports, the IOC has invested about $1 billion in hosting cities and has insured insurance companies for about $800 million, with the IOC paying up to $24 million for the Tokyo Games at a premium of 2-3 per cent.
虽然通常来说为会展取消设计的保险不包含因传染病取消的赔偿条款（例如今年年初的巴塞罗那世界移动大会），但安联保险的产品专家表示，国际大型活动的主办方一般会附加传染病相关的条款。
While insurance policies for convention and exhibition cancellations typically do not include provisions for compensation for infectious diseases (such as the Barcelona World Mobile Congress earlier this year), product experts at Allianz say that organizers of major international events typically include clauses relating to infectious diseases.
安联保险上周曾澄清，虽然公司已经同意为2021-2028年的奥运会承保，但并没有涉及东京奥运会的敞口。
Allianz clarified last week that although it had agreed to underwrite the 2021-2028 Olympics, it had no exposure to the Tokyo Olympics.
同样位于德国的慕尼黑再保险集团董事周五表示，公司为东京奥运会提供了“数亿欧元”的取消险产品。
On Friday, directors at Munich Reinsurance, also based in Germany, said the company had offered "hundreds of millions of euros" in risk cancellations for the Tokyo Olympics.
真正的问题在于，除了国际奥委会以外，赛事组织方、赞助商，甚至当地的酒店和租车公司都会购买类似的保险。
The real problem is that, in addition to the IOC, event organisers, sponsors, and even local hotel and car rental companies buy similar insurance.
据投行Jefferies预估，将电视转播方和赞助商都计入，已经投保的奥运支出预估在20亿美元，而与奥运相关的接待服务业还有6亿美元左右的支出已经投保。
Jefferies, the investment bank, reckons that television broadcasters and sponsors will be counted, with an estimated $2 billion in insured Olympic expenses and about $600 million in Olympic-related hospitality.
