“伊朗应对地震很有一套，但是传染病防控，他们实在没经验”视频截图：哈利其（图左）在发布会上不停擦汗。
"Iran has a great deal to do with earthquakes, but they don't have the experience of infectious disease control," video clip: Harry Potter (left) sweating at the conference.
当地时间2月25日，伊朗卫生部发言人、副部长哈利其（Iraj Harirchi）新冠病毒检测呈阳性。
Iran's health ministry spokesman, Deputy Minister Iraj Harrirchi, tested positive for the new crown virus on Feb. 25, local time.
稍晚些时候，哈利其本人公布了一段自拍视频，承认自己感染了病毒，并调侃称“病毒是民主的，不认识贫穷和富贵”。
Later, Harry Potter himself released a self-made video admitting he was infected with the virus and joking that "the virus is democratic and does not recognize poverty or wealth."
此前一天，美联社援引伊朗半官方媒体劳工新闻通讯社（ILNA）的消息称，本月以来伊朗什叶派圣城库姆市已有50人死于新冠病毒感染的肺炎。
The previous day, the Associated Press quoted Iran's semi-official news agency, the Labor News Agency, as saying 50 people had died of pneumonia from the new crown virus in the Shiite city of Qom this month.
据库姆市官员法拉哈尼（Ahmad Amiriabadi Farahani）透露，自2月13日起，该市已有50人死于新冠肺炎，并有超过250人正在接受隔离。
According to Ahmad Amiriabadi Farahani, an official in Qom, 50 people have died of pneumonia in the capital since February 13, and more than 250 are being quarantined.
但伊朗政府于2月19日才首次正式报告相关病例。
However, the Iranian Government officially reported the case for the first time only on 19 February.
不过，哈利其否认了这一说法。
However, Harry Potter has denied the claim.
阿拉伯卫星电视台（Al Arabiya）报道称，哈利其还说，如果库姆市因新冠病毒死亡的人数是媒体报道的1/4，“我就辞职”。
Al Arabiya reported that if the death toll from the new crown virus in Qom were one-quarter of media reports, "I'm quitting."
但他也承认，目前约有900名疑似病例正在接受检测。
But he acknowledged that about 900 suspected cases are now being tested.
哈利其是伊朗防疫工作的主要负责人之一，常在一线工作，并且与疑似患者有过近距离接触。
Harry is one of Iran's main responders, often working on the front lines, and has had close contact with suspected patients.
近期，他多次出席新闻发布会、接受电视台采访，当时都没有采取戴口罩等防护措施，且有发热、打喷嚏等症状出现。
Recently, he attended a number of press conferences, television interviews, when no protective measures such as wearing masks, and there are fever, sneezing and other symptoms.
在一场伊朗国家电视台播出的新闻发布会上，哈利其汗流不止，不断地擦汗。
At a news conference broadcast on Iranian state television, he sweated and kept sweating.
第二天，他就被确诊了。
The next day, he was diagnosed.
在哈利其确认感染后，伊朗国会的一名议员马哈默德·萨德吉也在社交媒体上发文称，自己感染新冠肺炎。
Mahmoud Sadji, a lawmaker in Iran's parliament, also posted a message on social media after the infection was confirmed, saying he had contracted pneumonia.
根据伊朗卫生部2月25日公布的数据，伊朗目前已有16人死于新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎，累计95人感染。
Iran has died of pneumonia from a new coronavirus, killing 95 people, according to figures released February 25 by Iran's Health Ministry.
世界卫生组织（WHO）总干事谭德塞在24日的媒体通报会上说，虽然新冠疫情尚未达到全球大流行的地步，但各国应为潜在的大流行做好准备。
The World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Theresa Tupper told reporters on the 24th that while the new crown has not yet reached the level of a global pandemic, countries should be prepared for a potential pandemic.
死亡率远超世界平均水平按照伊朗官方公布的数据，伊朗的死亡比例比任何其他国家都要高，死亡人数占总感染人数的近17%，远超世界平均水平。
Iran has more deaths than any other country, accounting for nearly 17 percent of the total, well above the world average, according to official Iranian figures.
按照世界卫生组织上周的通报，目前新型冠状病毒感染者死亡率约为2%。
According to the World Health Organization report last week, the death rate of new coronary infections is about 2 percent.
早在2月13日，就有消息称伊朗出现过疑似新冠病毒感染病例，但随后伊朗官方否认这些病例与新冠病毒有关，因为感染者没有去过中国。
As early as February 13, there were reports of a suspected new crown virus infection in Iran, but Iranian officials later denied the cases were linked to the virus because the infected had not been to China.
在2月11日，伊朗各地照常举行了伊斯兰革命胜利日集会游行活动，数百万民众涌上街头。
On February 11, Islamic Revolutionary Victory Day rallies were held across Iran and millions of people took to the streets.
伊朗第一次通报新冠疫情确诊病例是在2月19日，在通报当天，两位患者已死亡。
Iran first reported the confirmed cases of the New Crown Epidemic on 19 February, when the two patients died.
这两个确诊病例都来自伊朗的圣城库姆，确诊前没有和中国人接触过，也没有出过国，甚至连库姆都没离开过。
Both confirmed cases came from the holy city of Qom in Iran, and had no contact with the Chinese before the diagnosis, nor had they been abroad, not even left Qom.
随后，伊朗的确诊病例快速增加，21日新增13例，其中2人死亡，22日新增10例，其中1人死亡……25日更是陡然新增确诊34例、死亡4例。
Subsequently, there was a rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases in Iran, with 13 new cases reported on the 21st day, including 2 deaths and 10 new cases on the 22nd.
但迄今为止，传染源一直无法查清。
To date, however, the source of the infection remains unidentified.
伊朗卫生部官员莫瑞兹（Minou Mohrez）说，病毒已到达包括德黑兰、巴博勒、阿拉克、伊斯法罕、拉什特等在内的很多城市，“很明显，新型冠状病毒已经开始在伊朗传播。
Minou Mohrez, an official with the Iranian health ministry, said the virus had reached many cities, including Tehran, Babol, Arak, Isfahan and Lasht. "It is clear that the new coronavirus has begun to spread in Iran.
”据美联社报道，首都德黑兰第13区的市长拉赫曼扎德也被隔离了。
The capital, Tehran's 13th district mayor, Lakhmanzad, has also been quarantined, AP reported.
为了防止病毒传播，伊朗全国大部分地区的学校暂时停课，并暂停足球比赛和电影放映，首都德黑兰的地铁和公共汽车内，每天都进行消毒。
In order to prevent the spread of the virus, schools have been suspended in most parts of the country, football matches and film screenings have been suspended, and daily disinfection has been carried out in metro and bus facilities in the capital Tehran.
一位名为Parsa的德黑兰市民告诉《中国新闻周刊》，现在生活还照常，德黑兰街头戴口罩的人并不多，因为人们被告知只有感染者和感染者的接触者出门需要戴口罩。
Life is still as usual and not many people in Tehran wear masks on the streets because people are told that only those who come into contact with the infected and infected need to wear masks when they go out, a Tehran resident named Parsa told China News Weekly.
“不过也有一些人囤积了他们根本用不完的物资，包括食品等等，造成了很多东西短缺。
"But there are also people who are stocking up on things they can't use at all, including food, causing a lot of shortages.
”伊朗的疫情也正在向国际社会扩散。
The Iranian epidemic is also spreading internationally.
加拿大、黎巴嫩和阿拉伯联合酋长国，都出现了伊朗的输入病例。
In Canada, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates, there have been imported cases from Iran.
仅2月24日一天，5个中东国家都宣布，境内出现首名新冠确诊患者，分别是阿富汗、巴林、伊拉克、科威特、阿曼，且这些感染者都与伊朗有关。
On 24 February alone, five countries in the Middle East announced the first confirmed cases in their territories, namely Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait and Oman, all of whom are associated with Iran.
其中，科威特公布的3个病例来自上周从伊朗东北部城市马什哈德市撤离的700人之中，但伊朗尚未报告马什哈德出现任何病例。
Of these, three cases reported by Kuwait came from among 700 evacuees from the northeastern Iranian city of Mashhad last week, but Iran has yet to report any cases in Mashhad.
再加上媒体报道与官方公布数据之间的反差，让外界对伊朗政府的信息产生了疑问。
This, together with the contrast between media reports and official figures, raises questions about the Iranian government's message.
WHO紧急项目执行主任迈克尔·莱恩表示，伊朗的疫情还处于初期发展阶段，伊朗政府很可能只注意到了症状非常严重的病例。
Michael Laing, executive director of the WHO emergency program, said the Iranian epidemic was still in its early stages of development and that the Iranian government was likely to notice only very serious cases.
目前，已有巴基斯坦、伊拉克、土耳其、阿富汗和亚美尼亚这5个邻国宣布关闭与伊朗边境。
At present, five neighbouring countries, namely Pakistan, Iraq, Turkey, Afghanistan and Armenia, have announced the closure of their borders with Iran.
此外，还有一些国家暂停了与伊朗的交通往来。
In addition, a number of countries have suspended traffic with Iran.
2月23日，伊朗总统鲁哈尼在出席内阁会议时表示，德黑兰将动用军事力量控制疫情，尽可能地减小损失。
At a cabinet meeting on February 23, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Tehran would use military force to contain the outbreak and minimize losses.
据伊朗Press TV报道，鲁哈尼当天还签发命令，要求伊朗卫生部长纳马基牵头成立国家疫情防控指挥部。
Iran's Press TV reported that Rouhani also issued the same day order, Iran's Health Minister Namaki led the establishment of the National Command of Disease Control.
尽管公开的信息显示，感染病例多出自库姆，但伊朗并没有打算封锁这个疫情重灾区。
Although public information suggests that the majority of the infections are from Qom, Iran has no intention of sealing off the highly affected area.
库姆市长在2月25日晚称，封锁这座城市“不是一个合适的解决方案”。
Mayor Qom said on the night of Feb. 25 that sealing off the city was "not an appropriate solution."
伊朗商务部官员Musan在接受《中国新闻周刊》采访时说，现在这是一个非常严重的事件，“不过你应该知道，疫情被西方媒体渲染得很严重。
"This is a very serious matter now," said Musan, an Iranian commerce ministry official, in an interview with China News Weekly. "But you should be aware that the epidemic has been greatly exaggerated in the western media.
”缺乏防控经验，医疗资源有限库姆位于德黑兰以南约150公里处，是什叶派重要的朝圣地，拥有100多万人口，每年接待约2250万游客。
Lacking experience in prevention and control, Qom, with limited medical resources and located about 150 kilometers south of Tehran, is an important Shia pilgrimage site with a population of more than one million and receives about 22.5 million visitors a year.
因出差曾多次到库姆的中资机构员工徐松对《中国新闻周刊》说，由于是宗教圣城，库姆的经济水平一般，但是人员往来非常频密，每年都有几百万甚至上千万的朝圣者流动到库姆去。
Xu Song, a Chinese agency employee who has been to Qom several times for business trips, told China News Weekly that because it is a religious holy city, Qom's economy is mediocre, but the flow of people is intense, with millions or even tens of millions of pilgrims moving to Qom every year.
而且不仅仅是伊朗国内的教徒，其他国家的穆斯林只要是信奉什叶派的，都把库姆当作圣城。
And it is not just Iranians. Muslims in other countries who are Shia treat Qom as a holy city.
公元9世纪初，什叶派第八伊玛目阿里·礼萨把妹妹法蒂玛·马苏玛的陵墓建在库姆。
At the beginning of the 9th century, Ali Reza, the eighth Shia imam, built the tomb of his sister Fatima Massuma in Qom.
什叶派最大的神学院——库姆神学院也坐落在这里，伊朗伊斯兰革命领导人霍梅尼年轻时就曾在这里讲学。
The Qom seminary, the largest Shia seminary, is also home to Ayatollah Ali Khomeini, the leader of Iran's Islamic Revolution, who lectured here as a young man.
徐松说，库姆没有什么高楼大厦，街道很窄，清真寺非常多，到处都是朝圣的人，人流密集，妇女们从头到脚裹着着黑色的大袍子。
Xu said Qom had no high-rise buildings, narrow streets, a large number of mosques, a large crowd of pilgrims, and women wrapped from head to toe in large black robes.
库姆无论是街上的卫生条件还是当地的医疗、健康、卫生方面的能力，都远远比不上德黑兰、伊斯法罕这样的大城市。
Neither the sanitary conditions on the streets nor the local medical, health and sanitary capabilities of Qom are comparable to those of major cities such as Tehran and Isfahan.
“库姆本地医院我没有进去过，但从外观看规模都非常小。
"I didn't go into the Qom local hospital, but it was very small from the outside.
”据《金融时报》报道，由于美国多年的制裁，伊朗应对疫情的能力令人忧虑。
According to the Financial Times, Iran's ability to deal with the outbreak is worrisome because of years of US sanctions.
如果感染人数过多，伊朗基本不可能有足够的设备和资源去筛查、诊治患者。
If the number of infections is too high, it is virtually impossible for Iran to have enough equipment and resources to screen and treat patients.
在ILNA发布的报道中，法拉哈尼说当地没有一个护士有合适的防护装备，一些医疗专家已经离开了库姆，政府也没有针对库姆采取任何特别行动，他认为“政府在控制病毒方面的表现并不成功”。
In an ILNA report, Farahani said none of the nurses in the area had proper protective equipment, some medical experts had left Qom, and the government had not taken any special action against Qom, saying "the government has not been successful in controlling the virus."
中国前驻伊朗前大使华黎明认为，问题恐怕出在伊朗没有任何防控大型瘟疫的经验，有效的防控手段和措施也是缺失的。
China's former ambassador to Iran, Hua Dawn, says the problem is that Iran does not have any experience in controlling the pandemic, and that effective means and measures of prevention and control are missing.
华黎明告诉《中国新闻周刊》，气候上，整个伊朗干燥少雨，光照很强烈。
China News Weekly was told by Hua Dawn that the weather was dry and rainy across Iran and the light was strong.
饮食上，穆斯林的食谱相对比较窄也很讲究，肉食基本就是牛羊肉、鸡肉，鱼类只吃无鳞的，而且对于动物宰杀有严格的规定，例如在动物脖子的几寸处入刀，动物的血必须要放干净等等。
The diet of Muslims is relatively narrow and fastidious. Meat is basically beef and mutton, chicken, fish are only scaleless, and there are strict rules for animal slaughter, such as cutting in inches of an animal's neck, keeping its blood clean, etc.
如果动物是摔死的或者被枪打死的，他们是不吃的。
If an animal is killed by a fall or a gun, they don't eat it.
所以，无论是自然条件还是民众生活方式，伊朗都属于不太容易受瘟疫侵袭的那类国家。
As a result, Iran is among those countries that are less vulnerable to the plague, both in terms of natural conditions and people's way of life.
在历史上，没有发生过大规模的疫情，近些年的非典、H1N1等疫情对伊朗影响也都不是很大，没有在伊朗大规模爆发。
Historically, there have been no large-scale outbreaks, and neither SARS nor H1N1 outbreaks in recent years have had a significant impact on Iran, nor has there been a large-scale outbreak in Iran.
“伊朗面临的灾害主要是地震，他们应对地震很有一套，但是传染病防控，他们实在没经验。
"The disasters facing Iran are mainly earthquakes. They have a lot of experience in dealing with earthquakes, but they don't have the experience to control infectious diseases.
”华黎明说。
"said Hua Dawn.
据世界卫生组织公布的统计数据，2003年全球累计非典病例共8422例，涉及32个国家和地区，当年伊朗病例为零。
According to statistics released by the World Health Organization, there were 8,422 cases of SARS in 2003, involving 32 countries and regions.
从2012年至2019年6月30日，全球向世卫组织报告的中东呼吸综合征冠状病毒（MERS）感染病例总数为2449例，其中845例死亡，涉及27个国家，主要在中东、北非和韩国，其中伊朗报告了6例感染病例。
From 2012 to 30 June 2019, the total number of reported global cases of coronavirus (MERS) infection in the Middle East to WHO was 2,449, of which 845 deaths occurred in 27 countries, mainly in the Middle East, North Africa and the Republic of Korea, with Iran reporting six cases of infection.
据彭博新闻社2019年根据全球各国环境、医疗、健康风险等因素综合评比的国家健康指数中，伊朗排名为69位。
Iran ranks 69 on the Bloomberg News Agency's 2019 national health index, which compares environmental, medical and health risks across the globe.
WHO地中海东部区域办公室成员阿布巴卡尔说，伊朗拥有区域内最好的医疗卫生系统之一。
Abu Bakar, a member of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office, says Iran has one of the best health systems in the region.
徐松介绍，伊朗首都德黑兰的医疗水平比较高，大型公立医院的硬件软件水平和国内三级甲等医院的不相上下，但在整个德黑兰，这样水平的大医院只有有限的几所，大量存在的是专科医生自己开的小诊所。
Medical standards are high in the Iranian capital, Tehran, and the level of hardware and software in large public hospitals is comparable to that of level-A hospitals in the country, Xu said. But in Tehran as a whole, there are only a limited number of such large hospitals and a large number of small clinics run by specialists themselves.
一旦爆发大规模传染病，这些小诊所恐怕是没有能力去接诊、确诊感染者的。
Once the outbreak of large-scale infectious diseases, these small clinics may not be able to receive the diagnosis of infection.
伊朗卫生部长纳马基2月23日表示，伊朗每个城市都会设立至少一家新冠肺炎定点医院，在德黑兰等大城市可能会增加，治疗费用全免。
Iranian Health Minister Manouchehr al-Namaki said on February 23 that every Iranian city would have at least one hospital designated for pneumonia, possibly more in major cities such as Tehran and free of charge for treatment.
全国将投入至少230家医院，用以接受新冠肺炎患者。
At least 230 hospitals across the country will be used to receive new cases of pneumonia.
