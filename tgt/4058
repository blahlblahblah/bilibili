燃财经（ID:rancaijing）原创作者 | 孔明明编辑 | 周昶帆疫情之下，如何更安全地实现隔离，成了人们关注的重点。
How to achieve greater safety in the face of an outbreak of fire finance (ID: Rancaijing), formerly co-founder and author of Kong Mingming, has become a major concern.
在疫情期间，大公司如京东、美团、苏宁、顺丰等派出了自己的无人配送机器人，许多创业公司如智行者、驭势科技等无人车公司也在疫情中发挥着各自的作用。
During the epidemic, large companies such as Jingdong, the US Mission, Suning and Shunfeng sent their own unmanned robots, and many startups, such as Intelligent Traders and Crossing Technologies, played their part in the epidemic.
3月20日，燃财经举办线上沙龙，主题聚焦自动驾驶行业，新石器创始人兼CEO余恩源就“无人车如何重塑城市服务”主题进行了分享，并和燃财经总编辑贺树龙做了对话。
Founder and CEO Eryuan Yu shared his views on "Unmanned Cars Reinventing Urban Service," and held a dialogue with HE Shulong, chief financial editor of Fujian Finance, on March 20.
“在疫情中，随着无人车服务的发展，无人车的应用潜力正逐步被挖掘出来，无人车正处于黎明前的曙光中，只是曙光还没有照出来”，余恩源说，“3G、4G时代诞生了智能手机，也许无人车会在5G时代，作为一个新的端诞生。
"In the epidemic, with the development of unmanned car services, the potential of unmanned vehicles is gradually being excavated, in the dawn before dawn, just before dawn," said Yu. "Smartphones were born in the 3G, 4G era, and perhaps unmanned cars will be born as a new end in the 5G era."
“以下为余恩源的分享：疫情推动无人车进入快速发展赛道新石器无人车做的是一个汽车机器人。
"The following is the sharing of Yu Enyuan: What the epidemic is driving unmanned vehicles into the fast-growing Neolithic vehicle is a car robot.
我们车上不做任何载人业务，也没有司机，只做送货，我们把它用于城市里的毛细血管运输，能够实现外卖、快递、移动零售或其他一些末端城市服务。
We don't have any people in the car, no drivers, just delivery, and we use it for capillary transportation in the city, delivering takeaway, express delivery, mobile retail or some other end-of-town service.
我在物流行业待了很多年，做了很多物流智能工具方面的事情，比较了解物流配送这个市场，我们是一个产品化的团队。
I have been in the logistics industry for many years, do a lot of things about logistics intelligence tools, better understand the logistics distribution market, we are a product of the team.
现在新石器大约累计有200多辆无人车在全世界真实在跑，我们也会有更大的交付和部署计划。
With more than 200 unmanned vehicles now running around the world, we will also have more delivery and deployment plans.
疫情期间我们确实接到了很多需求，也看到了很多无人车能做出贡献的地方。
We did get a lot of demand during the epidemic, and we saw a lot of places where unattended cars could contribute.
到今天为止，我们大概累计有50多辆无人车参加了全国各地的抗击疫情工作。
So far, we have about 50 unmanned vehicles around the country to participate in the fight against the epidemic.
在武汉，我们有18辆无人车进入医院和社区提供消毒、无人配送等服务。
In Wuhan, we have 18 unmanned vehicles into hospitals and communities to provide disinfection, unmanned distribution and other services.
我们现在看到，无人车已经能在武汉社区里取代大部分有人的车辆，支撑起三个社区的日常生活服务，平均每天给300个家庭提供日常所需的生活物品，平均每单重量大约在三到五公斤。
We now see that unmanned vehicles have replaced most of the human vehicles in Wuhan communities, supporting the daily services of the three communities, providing 300 families with daily necessities on average, at an average weight of about three to five kilograms per unit.
在疫情后半场，我们渐渐看到，随着无人车服务的发展，无人车的应用潜力正在逐步被挖掘出来。
In the second half of the epidemic, we are beginning to see that with the development of unmanned car services, the potential of unmanned vehicles is gradually being excavated.
经过疫情影响，大家对于无人车的社会价值真正有了认知和认可，我认为这是无人车接下来能进入快速发展赛道的重要契机。
After the epidemic, people have a real understanding and recognition of the social value of unmanned vehicles, I think this is the next unmanned cars can enter the rapid development of the track an important opportunity.
无人车正处于黎明前的曙光中我们认为，未来无人车真正价值点在于它是一个集成了新能源汽车、AI、机器人三层能力的产品。
Unmanned car in the dawn we think the real value of the future unmanned car is that it is a new energy vehicle, AI, robot capabilities three-tier product.
现在很多餐饮行业主动跟我们联系，希望通过无人车为用户提供更安静、更卫生的无人接触送餐服务；别的客户也在联合我们主动去创造、去实现很多应用需求，我们也在逐步测试和展开运营一些可能落地的业务。
Many restaurants are now reaching out to us in the hope of providing quieter, more hygienic, untouched meals through unmanned vehicles; other customers are joining forces with us to create and implement many applications, and we are gradually testing and rolling out some businesses that might land.
在整个城市生活服务上，无人配送批量化团餐的需求现在有快速增长的机会，也是我们认为目前比较适合无人车去做的领域。
In the whole city life service, the demand for undistributed bulk meals has the opportunity of rapid growth, which we think is more suitable for unmanned vehicles to do at present.
从长远看，如果认真研究任何一家末端物流的服务企业，都会发现它的末端物流设计是网格化的，无人车也一样。
In the long run, if you study any end-of-pipe logistics service enterprise, you will find that its terminal logistics design is grid-based, and so is the unmanned vehicle.
无人车作为智慧城市的服务网格，是一个承接智慧城市云数据、万物互联的服务网格，也是一个由节点、交互、数据、算法、交付构成的价值闭环。
As the service grid of the intelligent city, the unmanned vehicle is a service grid which takes over the intelligent city cloud data and everything is interconnected. It is also a value closed loop composed of nodes, interactions, data, algorithms and deliveries.
在这个城市网格里，会有多辆无人车执行不同任务，不断优化效率，而它又是城市网格的一个数据节点，这个数据节点会不断采集在网格里的所有服务数据，最后形成闭环，从而达到整个城市效率优化的目的。
In this urban grid, there will be several unmanned vehicles to perform different tasks, continuously optimize efficiency, and it is a data node of urban grid, this data node will continuously collect all the service data in the grid, and finally form a closed loop, so as to optimize the efficiency of the whole city.
我们认为这项进程在今年会出现第一批服务网格，在未来三四年会逐步扩大。
We believe that this process will see the first service grids this year and will gradually expand in the next three to four years.
无人车正处于黎明前的曙光中，只是曙光还没照出来，但它的大概运行模式、商业模型价值，现在已经可以推导出来了。
The unmanned vehicle was in the early dawn, but the dawn had not yet dawned, but its approximate mode of operation, commercial model value, can now be deduced.
随着城市网格的发展，通过无人车的逐步普及和复制，在形成一个更大的服务网络时，无人车落地的曙光也就真正来了。
With the development of urban grid, through the gradual popularization and replication of unmanned vehicles, in the formation of a larger network of services, the dawn of the arrival of unmanned cars will really come.
对话余恩源：聊成本无人车已有在某些区域成立的商业模型燃财经：有报道称，你们的投资方理想汽车将其公司旗下的动力电池业务转让给你们，这个消息是否属实？为什么会进行这一合作？余恩源：消息属实，理想汽车旗下的动力电池业务已经被我们兼并了。
DialogueA: Is it true that your investor Ideal Car transferred his company's power battery business to you? Why is this collaboration taking place? Mr. Yu: That's true. Ideal car power battery business has been merged with us.
新石器是一家做软硬结合产品的公司，硬件方面最重要的是供应链。
Neolithic is a hard and soft products company, the most important hardware is the supply chain.
作为一个新能源车，能源设备是否可靠、可运营，是最重要的事情。
As a new energy vehicle, energy equipment reliability, operational, is the most important thing.
在这次融资时，我们向理想汽车提了出来，并借融资的机会，完成这项操作。
At the time of the financing, we mentioned it to the Ideal Car and took the opportunity to raise capital to complete the operation.
燃财经：无人配送现在的成本是什么样的？从需求和成本角度考虑，疫情结束后在哪些场景下有可持续性？余恩源：其实每一台无人车的ROI都算得过来，只是计算方法不同。
Flaming Finance: What are the costs of undistributed vehicles? In terms of demand and cost, what are the scenarios for sustainability after the outbreak? Mr. Yu: Actually every ROI of an unmanned vehicle can be calculated differently.
任何一个产品在诞生时，都会经历从高成本到低成本的经典变化曲线，在不同的阶段，对应不同的客户和商业模式。
When any product is born, it will experience a classic curve of change from high cost to low cost, corresponding to different customers and business models at different stages.
无人车现在可能还不能运载一些对流程效率要求较高的产品，但现在已经可以去做一些高密度市场的产品，比如我们在CBD送盒饭和快递时，商业模型成立，但在三四线城市，商业模型还不成立。
Unmanned vehicles may not yet be able to carry some of the more process-efficient products, but now it is possible to do high-density market products, such as the commercial model that we created when CBD delivered boxed rice and express delivery, but in the third- and fourth-tier cities, the business model is not yet valid.
疫情结束后，我们会先进入一些高密度订单的场景。
After the outbreak is over, we'll start with some high-density orders.
国外比较好计算，因为国外人力成本高，在国外能跑起来的环境中，将人员工资本身和无人车现在的成本对比，已经有了可行性。
It is easier to calculate abroad because of the high cost of manpower abroad, and in an environment where it is possible to run abroad, it is feasible to compare the wages of the personnel themselves with the cost of unmanned vehicles today.
燃财经：关于CBD送盒饭的例子，能算算详细的账吗？余恩源：CBD送盒饭，无人车一趟可以送100份，而外卖员一趟只能送五份到十份，效率相差了十倍。
Flaming Finance: Can we calculate the detailed account for CBD box rice? Yu: CBD can deliver 100 unattended meals at a time, while take-out workers can deliver five to ten meals at a time, a ten-fold difference in efficiency.
我们还可以做预售订餐和现场现卖的混合服务模式。
We can also do pre-sale orders and on-the-spot sales of mixed service model.
这样的服务模式是外卖员提供不了的，但无人车可以。
Such a service model is not available to take out, but unattended cars can.
聊政策政策松动会越来越快燃财经：CBD送盒饭，有什么政策方面的障碍？如果有担心的话，是什么？余恩源：政策障碍肯定很大。
Talk about loosening policy will burn faster and faster Finance: CBD, what are the policy barriers to delivering boxed rice? If so, what are they?
在中国，尤其我们这种做物流的无人车，上路没有任何法律法规，也不符合目前智能网联驾驶对有驾驶舱和安全员的要求。
In China, especially our kind of unmanned vehicles do logistics, there are no laws and regulations on the road, nor do they meet the current intelligent network driving requirements for cockpit and safety.
但我有信心，无人车在中国上路这件事情，在政策层面会松动得越来越快。
But I am confident that the unattended road in China will loosen up faster and faster at the policy level.
我担心的是，现在标准制定和法规制定赶不上无人车企业的发展速度，可能会出现无序的情况。
My concern is that standard-setting and regulation are not keeping pace with the growth of unattended vehicles, and that disorder may ensue.
其中我最担心的是，大家能不能确保安全的问题，否则对行业会有非常大的打击。
One of my biggest concerns is whether we can ensure the safety of the problem, or the industry will have a very big blow.
燃财经：安全肯定不只是创业公司的事情，你认为要想保证安全，整个社会需要做哪些努力？余恩源：安全是一个非常大的系统性问题，我们希望在整个产业链条上，我们、上下游企业、政府、科研院校实验室都能参与进来。
What do you think the whole society needs to do to ensure safety? Yu: Security is a very big systemic problem, and we hope that we, upstream and downstream enterprises, governments, and laboratories of scientific research schools can participate in the whole industry chain.
虽然无人车现在处于一个没有标准的阶段，但希望大家能够真正在规模化上路运营上，向批量化标准靠近，无人车企业也要遵循一些汽车量产化的技术标准，保证真正的底线安全。
Although the unmanned car is now in a non-standard stage, but hope that you can really scale up to the road operation, to the bulk standards, unmanned cars enterprises must also follow some of the technical standards of car production, to ensure the true bottom line safety.
燃财经：听说你最近拿到了近300套新增订单，目前服务的客户都集中在哪些领域？他们都有什么需求？为什么无人车会在这些领域率先被使用？余恩源：这些客户目前集中在华东和其他几个区域市场，主要订单来源为园区和一些运输服务运营企业，搭载的业务是批量送餐和一些物流快递转运业务。
Flaming Finance: I hear that you have recently received nearly 300 new orders. What are the areas where customers are currently concentrated? Why do they need unattended cars? YU: These customers are concentrated in East China and several other regional markets.
无人车现在的客户模型，还是典型的创新者模型。
The current customer model of an unmanned car is also a typical innovator model.
这些客户对于整个无人车的创新型服务要求，愿意付出一些尝试的成本，一起作为种子落地，在服务网格里逐步效率提升，并逐步复制。
These customers are willing to pay a few trial costs for the entire unmanned vehicle innovation service, together as a seed landing, in the service grid gradually efficiency improvement, and gradually replicate.
聊竞合巨大赛道需要抱团取暖燃财经：美团、京东、苏宁等大公司都在进入无人配送这个领域，你认为新石器的优势是什么？如何竞争？余恩源：创业公司唯一的机会就是专注一点、不能分神，玩命押一个点做突破。
What do you think are the advantages of Neolithic? How to compete? Yun Yuan: The only chance for a startup is to concentrate, stay focused and make a breakthrough.
所有的巨头无人车公司最大的束缚点是，他们没办法做一个软硬结合的产品，并且他们要在集团业务框架之内活动。
The biggest constraint for all the giant drones is that they can't make a hard-and-soft combination, and they have to operate within the group's business framework.
另一方面，我认为无人车赛道是一个非常巨大的赛道，我们和巨头公司都处于探索的过程中，这时应该抱团取暖、互通有无，一起把赛道开启起来。
On the other hand, I think the unattended track is a very big track, and we and the giant companies are in the process of exploring it.
燃财经：新石器目前和互联网巨头公司在业务上有合作吗？余恩源：我们和阿里、京东、美团、百度、华为都有较好的战略级别合作，他们的无人车团队和我们沟通得比较紧密，也会合作一些产品，我们的硬件产品也提供给了多家公司。
Are Neolithic co-operating with Internet giants right now? Mr. Yu: We work with Ali, Jingdong, USM, Baidu and Huawei at a better strategic level, their unmanned teams communicate with us more closely, and cooperate with some products, and our hardware products are provided to many companies.
燃财经：除了目前的送餐等场景，新石器还在重点研究和布局哪些场景？选择场景的判断依据是什么？余恩源：我们现在把场景分为两个大方向，一个是无人配送的方向，就是送餐和移动零售；另一个方向是特种应用，比如安防巡逻、喷洒消毒、医院内部的无人化运输等，这些都是项目制，我们会发展一些解决方案能力，提供给有需求的客户。
In addition to the present situation of food delivery, what are the scenarios in which the Neolithic is still focusing its research and layout? YUEN Yuan: We are now dividing the scene into two main directions: Undistributed direction, i.e., delivery and mobile retail; and special applications such as security patrols, spraying, unattended transportation within the hospital, etc., which are project-based.
其实我们选择场景的依据非常简单，就是谁能够给我们足够多的钱。
In fact, we choose the scene on the basis of a very simple, that is, who can give us enough money.
我们是一家创业公司，必须要有收入，才能活下去。
We are a start-up company, we must have an income to survive.
燃财经：什么类型的客户能给你们足够多的钱？余恩源：现在能买单的客户有两个典型特征，一是创新型客户；二是他手里有足够大价值的场景。
Flaming Finance: What kind of customer gives you enough money? Mr. Yu: There are two typical characteristics of a paying customer these days, one is an innovative customer and the other is that he has enough value in his hand.
比如商务密集区，比如美团京东手里有足够庞大的业务，能提炼出来足够大的价值，先去进行高成本尝试。
For example, business agglomerations, such as the Beijing-East US Mission, have large enough businesses to extract enough value to be tried out at a high cost.
聊未来5G时代，无人车也许会作为一个新的端诞生燃财经：我看你有一个判断是——无人车真正在全国普及还需要4年的时间，为什么是4年？余恩源：从技术上看，我们判断在未来一两年内迭代会越来越快，成本也会快速下降，到了第三四年，无人车的量一定会爆发，我们判断爆发点大概是在能到达年产或者市场规模一万台时。
Talk about the next 5G era, when unattended cars may be born as a new breed of business: I think you have a judgment that it will take another four years for unmanned cars to really populate the country, and why? Mr. Yu: Technically, we judge that iterations will get faster and costs will drop rapidly in the next year or two.
按照用户发展的一般规律，我们推算出，可能在第四年时，整个社会对无人车的需求会有一个大拐点出现。
According to the general law of user development, we have calculated that there may be a big inflection point in the demand for unattended cars in the whole society in the fourth year.
分享一个数字，北京有1万个写字楼，如果每天中午平均两个写字楼需要一台无人车送货，大概会有5000台无人车的规模。
Share a figure of 10,000 office buildings in Beijing. If an average of two offices need an empty delivery vehicle at noon each day, it could be the size of 5,000 unattended cars.
我们认为如果四年内能有5000台落地，接近于靠谱。
We think that if we land 5,000 units in four years, it's pretty close to the mark.
燃财经：有一种说法是，新石器相比于其他同行的最大竞争优势，是理想汽车提供的车规级底盘和百度的Apollo自动驾驶系统的支持，而新石器扮演的是技术集成商和制造商的角色，你怎么看这一说法？你认为技术的自主研发能力差异对企业的影响大吗？余恩源：这个问题已经困扰了我们很久。
What do you think of the argument that the biggest competitive advantage of Neolithic versus other competitors is that the Ideal car-size chassis and Baidu's Apollo autopilot support, while Neolithic plays the role of technology integrator and manufacturer? YU Enyuan: This problem has been bothering us for a long time.
我们是一个创业团队，但我们又做了一个软硬结合的产品，做硬件产品很费钱，于是我们找了理想汽车帮忙搞定一些供应链资源；工厂确实是我们自己建的，因为无人车和SUV完全是两个产品，没办法共用一个产线。
We were a start-up team, but we did a hard-and-soft combination and it was expensive to make hardware, so we found the ideal car to help with some supply chain resources; we built the factory ourselves, because the unmanned car and SUV were two completely different products and we couldn't share the same production line.
另外我们很感谢百度，百度开发了很多基础能力，让创业团队能够快速上手，2018年对我们帮助非常大，但2019年当我们的无人车部署环境越来越复杂时，我们的团队已经接手了这部分工作。
In addition, we appreciate Baidu, Baidu has developed a number of basic capabilities, so that the entrepreneurial team can quickly start, 2018 to help us very much, but 2019 when our unmanned deployment environment has become more complex, our team has taken over this part of the work.
现在我们跟百度在地图仿真等一些云服务方面合作会比较多。
Now we and Baidu in the map simulation and other cloud services cooperation will be more.
新石器其实是一个产品团队。
Neolithic is actually a product team.
我们只能选择把有限的战略资源集中在产品交付、用户及运营效率这些核心环节上，除此之外，我们可能都会采取合作姿势，这是我们和业内大部分技术公司最大的不同。
We can only choose to focus our limited strategic resources on the core issues of product delivery, user and operational efficiency. In addition, we may all adopt cooperative postures, which is the biggest difference between us and most technology companies in the industry.
技术公司提供的是技术产品，不一定直接触达末端用户，而产品公司一定要做到平衡，平衡性可能比技术更重要。
Technology companies offer technical products that do not necessarily reach end-users directly, and product companies must be balanced, which may be more important than technology.
燃财经：你认为5G浪潮，会给新石器带来哪些新的变化和机会？又会给行业带来哪些变化？会增加哪些应用场景和商业化落地？余恩源：我认为无人车会是5G浪潮非常大的一个受益者，无人车也会推动5G浪潮。
Flaming Finance: What new changes and opportunities do you think the 5G Wave will bring to the Neolithic? What changes will it bring to the industry? What application scenarios and commercial landings will be added? YU: I think the UAV will be a very big beneficiary of the 5G Wave.
我们一台无人车，一天上面大概会产生一两个TB的数据，这些数据4G传不回去，只有5G这种大带宽才能传得回去。
We have an unmanned car that generates about one or two terabytes of data a day that doesn't travel back, and only 5 gigabytes of that bandwidth can get back.
在4G网络下，并不是真正意义上可联网的无人车。
Under the 4G network, it is not an unmanned car in the true sense of the word.
另一方面，5G网络低时延的特点，对于我们的远程驾驶系统非常好。
On the other hand, the low latency characteristic of 5G network is very good for our remote driving system.
有了5G，才能实现真正意义上的远程驾驶，再搭配自动驾驶，运营能力会成倍提高。
With 5 gigabytes, can achieve true sense of long-distance driving, combined with automatic driving, the ability to operate will double.
3G、4G时代诞生了智能手机，也许无人车会在5G时代，作为一个新的端诞生。
The age of 3G and 4G saw the birth of smartphones, perhaps unmanned cars in the 5G era, as a new end.
我们认为，无人车的发展路径也逐渐清晰：无人车会走出和传统汽车行业商用车、乘用车不同的发展路径，小型无人服务车会先发展起来，中大型无人服务车会逐步跟上，这也是创新型科技产品商业化为用户接受的一个普遍过程。
In our view, the development path of unattended cars is also becoming clear: the unattended cars will follow the different development paths of commercial vehicles and passenger cars in the traditional automobile industry. Small unmanned service vehicles will develop first, and large and medium-sized unserviced vehicles will gradually catch up. This is also a common process of commercialization of innovative technology products.
