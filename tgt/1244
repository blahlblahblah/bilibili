澎湃新闻记者 韩雨亭 通讯员 李俊平2月15日，武汉市汉口医院120急救站护士彭璟在一线抗疫已经30天，今天让她最高兴的一件事情是——“我终于痛痛快快地洗了一把脸。
Peng Jing, a 120-first-aid station nurse at Hankou Hospital in Wuhan City, Heng Jing, had been fighting the first-line epidemic for 30 days on Feb. 15.
”作为急诊室护士，30天来，她一直坚守在抗疫一线，每天面对在生死之间较量的新冠肺炎的患者，检查仪器、输液、配药、打针、铺床、换药...... 起早贪黑，不敢松懈。
For 30 days as an ER nurse, she had been on the frontlines of the epidemic, checking instruments, transfusions, dispensing drugs, injections, making beds and changing medicines every day in the face of a new crown pneumonia, a battle between life and death.
“我做的都是我应该做的，只是做好本职工作。
"I'm doing what I'm supposed to do, just do my job.
”35岁的彭璟对澎湃新闻称。
Peng Jing, 35, Jing told the surging news.
30天来，武汉汉口医院急救站护士彭璟一直坚守在抗疫一线。
In the past 30 days, Wuhan Hankou Hospital emergency station nurses Peng Jing has been adhering to the first line.
做完手术上一线抗疫2019年底，彭璟感觉左眼视力下降，视力范围受限，经过检查，她患有虹膜粘连，急需手术治疗。
At the end of 2019, Peng Jing felt loss of vision in her left eye and limited scope of vision. After examination, she suffered from iris adhesion and needed urgent surgical treatment.
经过本地一名眼科医生推荐，她在重庆找到了一位治疗葡萄膜炎的权威专家。
On the recommendation of a local ophthalmologist, she found a leading specialist in Chongqing to treat uveitis.
1月13日—15日，她在重庆第一附属医院分别做了两次手术，医生建议她休息一段时间才能去上班。
On January 13-15, she underwent two operations at Chongqing's First Affiliate Hospital, and doctors advised her to take some time off before going to work.
当时正逢武汉疫情蔓延，武汉市汉口医院涌入许多前来求诊的患者，眼看同事们忙得不可开交，彭璟决定赶回武汉和同事一起并肩作战。
When Wuhan epidemic spread, Wuhan Hankou Hospital crowded many patients to seek medical treatment, watching colleagues busy, Peng Jing decided to go back to Wuhan to work side by side with his colleagues.
1月16日下午，复查结束，她立即决定赶回武汉。
January 16 afternoon, the review ended, she immediately decided to go back to Wuhan.
恰逢春运期间，重庆直达武汉的动车票已经销售一空，她抢在最后5分钟买了一张从重庆到丰都的火车票，经过一番折腾，成功上车。
The train ticket from Chongqing to Fengdu was sold out during the Spring Festival and she managed to get on the train after a rough ride in the last five minutes.
彭璟回忆称，上车后，她喜极而泣，回到武汉第二天，她就到医院上班了。
Peng Jing recalls that after getting on the car, she burst into tears and returned to Wuhan the next day, she went to the hospital.
作为120急救站的护士，通常要上满24小时才会下班，不仅无法按时吃饭，睡眠也无法保证。
Nurses at the 120 first aid stations usually have to work 24 hours to get out of work. Not only can't they eat regularly, they can't sleep.
当医院领导听说她刚做完手术，劝她休息，她说是个小手术，无需休息。
When the hospital director heard that she had just had an operation and advised her to rest, she said it was a minor operation and did not need a rest.
武汉汉口医院作为收治新冠肺炎的定点医院，承担大量的收治任务，防护物资也极其匮乏。
Wuhan Hankou Hospital, as the designated hospital for the treatment of new crown pneumonia, undertakes a large number of treatment tasks, protective materials are also extremely scarce.
为节省护目镜，彭璟只能用84消毒液杀菌，这样才能反复使用，但84消毒液产生的氯气会刺激眼睛，令人异常难受，每当她抢救完病人，只能用激素眼药水来减轻不适感。
To save the goggles, Peng Jing can only use 84 disinfectant sterilization, which can be re-use, but 84 disinfectant produced chlorine irritate the eyes, it is extremely uncomfortable, every time she rescued the patient, can only use hormone eyedrops to ease discomfort.
最让她难受的是每次出车回来，她都无法用水洗脸，只能拿洗面巾檫面，每次下班，她都感觉脸上黏黏糊糊的，时间长了，会特别不舒服。
Most of all, she was unable to wash her face with water when she returned from her trip. She was sassafras and felt sticky and uncomfortable every time she came home from work.

最长连续工作96小时1月19日，这一天原本是彭璟的休息日，当天正好有一位年轻的护士临时有事，此时医院正是抗击疫情的关键时刻，正是用人之际，彭璟见到她很着急，主动提出帮忙顶班，此后她多次主动帮同事顶班。
The longest continuous work 96 hours January 19, which was originally Peng Jing rest day, the day when a young nurse was on temporary duty, the hospital is fighting the epidemic at a critical time, PANG Jing saw her very anxious, offered to help replace the shift, she has repeatedly volunteered to help colleagues.
当有人问她在眼睛急需休息之际，为何还要主动帮助同事顶班，她的回答是：“我是他们的老大姐，也是一名党员，我应该做表率。
When she was asked why she was taking the initiative to help her colleagues when her eyes were badly in need of rest, she replied, "I am their elder sister and a Party member, and I should lead by example.
”在抗击疫情期间，彭璟值得最长的一次班是从1月23日至1月26日之间，她几乎都在医院出车，忙前忙后，前后总共工作了96小时才回家休息。
During the fight against the epidemic, Peng Jing was worth the longest class from January 23 to January 26, when she worked a total of 96 hours before and after her busy schedule at the hospital.
有次，由于长时间没有洗过头发，她忍不住戴着游泳镜洗了一回，未成想因长期没有休息，抵抗力有所下降，那次洗完头发，她就出现感冒、咳嗽症状，她担心感染了新冠肺炎，还到医院做了CT检查，所幸检查结果正常。
Once, having not washed her hair for a long time, she could not help washing it in a swimming mirror. She could not resist a decline in resistance due to prolonged absence of rest. After that wash, she developed colds and cough symptoms, feared contracting pneumonia and went to the hospital for a CT scan.
彭璟住得离医院很远，武汉“封城”后，全城交通管制，让她上班极为不便。
Peng Jing living far from the hospital, Wuhan "closed" after the city traffic control, let her work extremely inconvenient.
虽然医院给医护人员提供了临时酒店，但她并没申请，觉得应该留给更多住得远的医护人员。
Although the hospital provided a temporary hotel for medical staff, she did not apply and felt that it should be reserved for more health-care workers living far away.
“我可以在值班室将就就可以了。
"I'll just be in the duty room.
”彭璟说。
Peng Jing said.
为赶医院的班车，每天早晨，她必须5点半起床，下班的班车，即使正常下班，她回到家通常已是晚上8点钟了。
In order to catch the hospital bus, she must get up at 5: 30 every morning. Even when she comes home from work normally, it is usually 8 o'clock at night.
“看到同事们都很团结、积极的奋战在一线，我会特别感动，别人能坚持，我也一定能坚持，我的要求不多，只要能正常洗脸、洗头，我就心满意足了。
"I will be especially moved to see that my colleagues are united and active in the field. I will be especially moved by the persistence of others and I will persist.
”彭璟说。
