湖北黄石市中心医院、大冶市人民医院下了两份订单：米、面、食用油、水饮、干调，算下来共近6吨的物资，加急、要求24点前送达。
Huangshi Huangshi City Central Hospital, Daye City People's Hospital issued two orders: rice, noodles, cooking oil, water drinks, dry tone, a total of nearly 6 tons of supplies, urgent, required before 24.
往年过年，很多住院病人都会回家，今年不一样，病人多、医生也都在岗，急需后勤物资保障。
In previous New Year, many inpatients will go home, this year is not the same, many patients, doctors are also on duty, urgently need logistical support.
但这些米面粮油能否按时到达，医院采购人员没有底：因为整个地区的运转，包括交通物流已经深受疫情影响。
But whether the rice flour and oil can arrive on time, hospital procurement staff have no bottom line: because the entire operation of the region, including transportation logistics has been deeply affected by the epidemic.
90后小伙谭德孝是负责运送这两份订单的货车司机。
Tam Dexiao, a 90-year-old man, is the van driver who transports the two orders.
他本来盘算着，这一个任务虽然异常重要，但按时送达不成问题：按他经验，从武汉往这两家医院发货不算太远，按他平时走高速的话，这一趟3个小时足够，即使走国道，时间也应该赶得及，完全不耽误医院使用。
In his experience, it was not too far from Wuhan to deliver the goods to the two hospitals. At his usual high speed, the three-hour trip would have been sufficient, and even if he had taken the national road, it would have been possible to do so without delay.
没想到的是，这一去就是整整29个小时。
What I didn't expect was a 29-hour trip.
29小时的接力赛谭德孝是美菜的员工，而接下那个订单的是美菜大客户武汉一仓。
29-hour relay team Tan is an employee of American food, and the next order is from Wuhan, a major customer of American food.
很多外卖党的吃喝靠的就是美菜，尽管可能不知道这个名字。
Many take-out party members eat and drink on fine food, although they may not know the name.
美菜是国内大型食材配送供应商，为近300万餐饮商户供货。
American Cuisine is the domestic large-scale food distribution supplier, for nearly 3 million catering businesses.
美菜也正是武汉市东湖区招商引资的企业，2019年入驻的光谷。
American food is also Wuhan Donghu District attracting investment enterprises, 2019 into the Guanggu.
初一那天是美菜大客户武汉一仓仓储经理赵晓峰在岗。
On the first day of the first day is a large customer Wuhan warehouse manager Zhao Xiaofeng in the post.
一看是医院的订单，他紧急给安排的分拣投线。
Looking at the hospital order, he made an emergency arrangement of the sorting line.
只用了两个多小时，6吨物资准备齐全；19点，装车完毕，司机就是谭德孝。
It took just over two hours, six tons of supplies were ready, and at 19 o'clock, when the load was complete, the driver was Tan Dexiao.
当时高速已经封闭，谭德孝不想第二天让医生病人饿肚子，决定走夜路绕道107国道。
Now that the highway was closed, Tan decided not to starve his doctors and patients the next day and decided to take the night route around National Highway 107.
他的计划是先配送大冶市人民医院，再前往黄石市中心医院，全程175公里。
His plan is to distribute first the Daye People's Hospital and then to the Huangshi City Central Hospital, 175 kilometers along the way.
食材装车中那几天当地在下雨，雨夜行车，谭德孝走到鄂州、大冶交界处，意外发现，当地为防止疫情扩散，把道路挖断了。
Food loading in those days in the local rain, rain night driving, Tan Dexiao to Huzhou, Daye junction, accidentally found that the local to prevent the spread of the epidemic, the road cut.
谭德孝当时挺着急，就想从路障的侧面绕过去，没想到雨后泥泞、货车又重，陷进了路边软路基里。
Tan Dexiao was very anxious, just want to bypass the side of the roadblock, but after the rain mud, truck and heavy, trapped in the roadside soft roadbed.
于是，整个货车都倾斜了，一个后轮全陷在软泥里。
So the whole truck tilted and one of the rear wheels sank into the soft mud.
谭德孝下车忙活时，还摔进了水坑了，衣服鞋都湿了。
Tan Dexiao alighted from the busy work, also fell into the puddle, clothes and shoes are wet.
当时气温只有两三度，急需物质的大冶市人民医院，还在40公里之外。
At the time, the temperature was only two or three degrees and the urgently needed material was 40 km away from the Daye People's Hospital.
这时，是大年初一的晚上九点多，距谭德孝出发仅两个多小时。
At this time, is New Year's Day evening more than nine o'clock, only two hours away from Tan Dexiao departure.
谭德孝也不敢离开车，一边联系救援，一边得守着物资。
Tan Dexiao also did not dare to leave the car, while contacting the rescue, while guarding the material.
与此同时，在后方，公司同事、冷链主管杨军得到消息后，一边联系医院，说明意外情况、跟医院后勤人员道歉求谅解；一边也火速开车出发去帮忙救援。
At the same time, in the rear, the company's colleague, cold chain director Yang Jun received the news, while contacting the hospital, explaining the accident, apologizing to hospital staff for understanding, and driving quickly to help rescue.
可这时候封路的地方就更多了，杨军硬是走了两条路都被新路障栏下了，往返白白走了近100公里，干着急。
But this time there are more places to seal the road, Yang Jun simply walked two roads are under the new barricade, walking nearly 100 kilometers to and fro in vain, anxious.
晚上11点多，第二个同事司机常联合接力来帮忙了。
After 11 p. m., a second co-worker driver often joined forces to help.
常师傅本来那天在家里，货车都停在仓库了。
Master Chang was at home that day and the lorries were parked in the warehouse.
听闻这事以后，马上给谭德孝拿上衣服、打包饼干、煮鸡蛋、热水，匆匆赶到仓库，开着第二辆货车出发。
As soon as he heard about this, he took his clothes, packed biscuits, boiled eggs and hot water, hurried to the warehouse and drove off in a second van.
雨夜路滑，路上还有从山上冲刷下来的泥土，70公里的路，常联合开了2个小时才到那附近。
The road was slippery on a rainy night, with dirt washed down from the hills and covering a distance of 70 kilometers, often driving in unison for two hours before arriving nearby.
这时已经是大年初二的凌晨1点多。
It was already 1: 00 in the morning on New Year's Day.
更糟糕的是，路上又有了其他新路障，常联合的货车被迫停在了距谭德孝3.9公里远的地方。
To make matters worse, there were other new roadblocks on the road, and the often confederate lorries were forced to stop 3.9 kilometres from Tan.
深冬雨夜，也没手电，常联合拿手机照亮、导航，徒步背着衣服和吃的，终于和谭德孝汇合。
Deep winter rainy night, no flashlight, often combined with a mobile phone to light, navigation, on foot to carry clothes and food, and finally joined up with Tan Dexiao.
大半夜的，救援车也来不了，两人在没有空调的驾驶室捱了一宿。
In the middle of the night, rescuers were unable to get in, and the two spent the night in the air-conditioned cab.
初二上午，附近的村民发现了陷泥里的货车。
On the morning of the second day of junior high school, villagers nearby found a truck trapped in mud.
让小谭和老常感动的是，热心人马上从家给他俩拿来了吃的、衣服、鞋、烟；附近村镇干部得知货车是前往医院配送物资，马上决定给清障，救援的吊车得以进入。
Little Tan and Lao Chang were moved that the warm-hearted man brought them food, clothes, shoes and cigarettes from home at once. When a cadre of nearby villages and towns learned that the lorry was going to the hospital for distribution, they immediately decided to clear the way for the rescue crane to enter.
初二下午，这一车物资被吊出来，谭德孝终于能重新开车出发。
On the afternoon of the second day of junior high school, the load was hoisted out and Tan was finally able to start again.
谭德孝微信、朋友圈截图1月26日23:44，经过了29个小时，这些米面油被送到黄石市中心医院普爱院区。
Tan Dexiao Weixin, friend circle screenshot January 26 23: 44, after 29 hours, these rice noodle oil was sent to the central hospital in Yellowstone universal courtyard area.
之后黄石市中心医院协调当地政府，为美菜配送车辆办理疫期的特别通行证，可凭证走高速特别通道，减少路途时间。
Huangshi City Central Hospital then coordinated the local government, for the delivery of vehicles to deal with the epidemic period of special pass, can be used to certificate special high-speed passage, reduce travel time.
再送完第二家医院的货，1月27日、大年初三的傍晚，谭德孝平安回到武汉。
After sending the second hospital goods, January 27, the evening of the New Year's Day, Tan Dexiao safe return to Wuhan.
这一天多里谭德孝吃了不少苦，但没想着抱怨，甚至有些不好意思；初二下午货车被救出后，多数同事才知道这一趟的艰险，“车子不救起来，我们都不好意思给大家说这件事。
It was a day when Dortmund suffered a lot, but he didn't think about complaining or even feeling shy. It was only after the van was rescued in the afternoon that most of his colleagues realized how difficult the trip was.
”为湖北医院“送粮”的150名员工整整48小时后，谭德孝终于吃上了同事们给准备的热饭热菜。
"After delivering food to 150 staff at Hubei hospital for 48 hours, Tan finally dined on hot food prepared by his colleagues.
谭德孝在美菜武汉一仓的同事杨军，就是初一晚上最早开车去帮忙的同事，也放下心来：“虽然历经曲折，人，车，货安全到达，我可以稍微放心了。
Tan Dexiao in Wuhan Yicang colleagues, is the first night of the first car to help colleagues, also relaxed: "Although the twists and turns, people, cars, cargo arrived safely, I can relax a little.
”同事们也没闲着。
My colleagues were not idle.
1月26日，就在谭德孝赶赴黄石医院的路上，武汉协和医院、武大人民医院又都下单了数万元物资，大概备三天左右的货物，包括米、肉、水饮、冻货和调料等。
On January 26, just on his way to Huang Shi Hospital, Wuhan Hsiao Hospital and Wudang People's Hospital ordered tens of thousands of yuan worth of goods, including rice, meat, water drinks, frozen goods and seasonings.
近一周，美菜已经为武汉多所医院配送米面油、乳饮、干调、蛋类、肉禽和蔬菜等食材累积近10万斤。
Over the past week, American cuisine has distributed rice noodle oil, milk drinks, dry tones, eggs, poultry and vegetables to Wuhan hospitals, accumulating nearly 100,000 jin.
目前在美菜下订单的湖北省内医院有：华中科技大学附属协和医院、武汉大学人民医院、黄石市中心医院、黄石市中心医院普爱院区、大冶市人民医院、湖北六七二中西医结合骨科医院等。
At present, the following hospitals in Hubei Province place orders for American food: Huazhong University Affiliated Concorde Hospital, Wuhan University People's Hospital, Huangshi Central Hospital, Universal Love Hospital of Huangshi City Central Hospital, Daye People's Hospital, Hubei 672 Chinese and Western Medicine Combined Orthopaedic Hospital, etc.
在武汉地区，美菜参与“春节不打烊”的员工约有150位左右，其中，仓储一线40人，司机90-100人，另有值班管理人员20人左右。
In Wuhan, about 150 employees of American cuisine are involved in closing hours for the Spring Festival, including 40 in the warehouse, 90 to 100 in the driver and about 20 in charge on duty.
不止医院，他们也在为全地区饭店、食堂等客户送菜。
Not only the hospital, they are also for the entire region, such as restaurants and restaurants to deliver food.
谭德孝是自己报名“不打烊“的：“不应该一切以利益出来，采取自愿（报名配送）吧。
Tan Dexiao is his own registration "do not close": "All should not come out of the interest, take the voluntary (registration distribution).
我愿意报名，这么多人都在一线，我也贡献一点力量。
I would like to sign up, so many people are in the line, I also contribute a little strength.
不是说是个人英雄主人，的确我想贡献一份力量，捐款捐物资都行。
Not personal hero master, indeed I would like to contribute a share of strength, donations and donations will do.
”不只是谭德孝，一批司机师傅都愿意坚守岗位，保证配送。
"Not just Tan Tsiao, but a number of drivers are willing to stick to their posts and ensure delivery.
他们很多都不善言辞，在武汉六仓的群里，简简单单几个字表达了态度——“明天我能出车”。
Many of them are inarticulate, in the Wuhan six warehouse group, simply expressed the attitude - "I can go out tomorrow."
尽管有风险，这些司机师傅就都表示，给奋战在抗击疫情一线同胞的配送任务，他们愿意出力；另一方面，医院也会准备送防护服给司机，穿戴好送菜进后勤餐厨区。
Despite the risks, the drivers say they are willing to contribute to the task of fighting the delivery of supplies to their frontline compatriots, while hospitals are prepared to deliver protective clothing to drivers and bring food to the logistics kitchen area.
为一线员工健康，也为食品安全，美菜就想办法做足安全防护。
For the health of the front-line staff, but also for food safety, the United States food to do adequate safety precautions.
从入库安检到仓库分拣、出仓配送，所有生产车间也每天多次严格消毒、仓储员工一天两次测量体温、司机进仓统一测温，每天发放更新医用口罩、司机配免洗洗手液。
All production workshops are strictly sanitized several times a day. Warehouse workers take temperature twice a day, drivers take uniform temperature measurements in warehouses, and updated medical masks and wash-free hand sanitizers are distributed every day.
目前，他们正在与湖北相关部门协调，从1月27日开始，通过自身的采购体系、物流和配送体系优先为湖北的医院、驻军部队、防疫保障单位、防疫指挥机构等防疫一线部门提供食材配送。
From January 27, they are coordinating with the relevant authorities in Hubei Province, giving priority to the delivery of materials to hospitals, garrison troops, epidemic prevention guarantee units, epidemic prevention command agencies and other frontline epidemic prevention departments through their own procurement systems, logistics and distribution systems.
货车司机群截屏司机们的表态，大大出乎美菜高级副总裁江川在内的管理层的意料，也让他们为员工感动不已。
Truck drivers surprised management, including Jiang Chuan, senior vice-president of American cuisine, and moved their employees.
他告诉《棱镜》，目前美菜配送用户里，就有几家武汉的核心医院。
He told Prism that there are several core hospitals in Wuhan among the American food distribution users.
这份任务沉甸甸的。
The task was heavy.
关于上游进货，目前，他们和联合利华、雀巢、五得利面粉等在几百家供应商紧密合作，最大程度去满足用户的需求。
On upstream sourcing, they currently work closely with hundreds of suppliers, including Unilever, Nestle and Fried Flour, to maximize customer satisfaction.
今年情况非常特殊，随着疫情的蔓延发展，美菜观察到，截至23日17时，武汉美菜的订单数和交易额环比前一日都出现了30%的增长。
The situation this year is very special. As the epidemic spreads, American cuisine has observed an increase of 30 percent in the number of orders and transactions of Wuhan American food as of 1700 hours on the 23rd.
美菜武汉大区总经理文政懿分析，“可能是坚持营业的生鲜供应商越来越少，加上外卖需求增加，导致订单需求量上升。
"Maybe fewer and fewer fresh suppliers are sticking to their business," said Wen Zheng Yi, general manager of Wuhan. "Coupled with increased take-out demand, orders are rising.
”同时，文政懿表示，“只要还有餐厅营业下单，只要外卖还取餐，武汉美菜就会保障正常配送。
Meanwhile, Mr Wen said, "As long as there are restaurant orders and take-out meals, Wuhan American food will ensure normal distribution.
”更多生鲜食品正奔向武汉家庭正常配送，在疫情蔓延时期，为了实现这样的承诺，一群普通人得更加辛苦的工作。
More fresh food is being distributed to Wuhan families on a regular basis, and a group of ordinary people have to work harder to deliver on that promise during the epidemic.
1月26日，浙江湖州市新增2例确诊病例，其中德清县1例。
On January 26, two new cases were confirmed in Huzhou, Zhejiang Province, including one case in Deqing County.
这里是美菜杭州北辖区，杭州三仓偏偏就在德清县雷甸镇，距离新确诊的病例只有几公里远。
Here is the American food Hangzhou North District, Hangzhou Sancang just in the town of Reden, Deqing County, only a few kilometers away from the newly diagnosed case.
当天周围的104、304国道就都受到了封路影响，周边高速出口也在逐步关闭。
Around the day 104, 304 National Road have been affected by the closure of the road, the surrounding high-speed exit is gradually closing.
但截至26日16点30分，杭州北的下单餐厅商户数是150多家，其中大部分是外卖商户。
But as of 16: 30 pm on the 26th, there were more than 150 restaurants in the northern part of Hangzhou, most of which were take-out merchants.
湖州一处雨夜封路这意味着，食材配送不出去的话，杭州会有几千家庭的吃饭成问题；晨采的供应商再无法送货，生鲜和禽肉更会大面积缺货，餐厅会断档。
A rainy night in Huzhou means thousands of families in Hangzhou will have food problems if food supplies are not delivered; morning suppliers will no longer be able to deliver goods, raw and poultry meat will be out of stock on a large scale and the restaurant will be out of gear.
当天深夜，杭州北区的工作人员连夜探路，乡间小路、国道、高速逐个进行探访，找货车能走的路线。
Late that night, Hangzhou North District staff night-long road exploration, country roads, national roads, high-speed visits one by one, to find the truck can take the route.
司机师傅们有配送车，仓储员工开上自己的私家车，甚至骑着电动车连夜出动。
Drivers have delivery vehicles, warehouse staff drive their own private cars, and even ride out overnight on electric vehicles.
当地也是连续下了20多天的雨，路上又黑又滑。
It was raining for more than 20 days, and the road was dark and slippery.
晚上前半夜，他们找到了两条路，到凌晨两点多，又有变化，国道封闭。
In the middle of the night, they found two roads. By two o'clock in the morning, they had changed and the national highway was closed.
一行人再出发探路，最终找到了可行路线，都是后半夜了。
The party set out again to explore the road and finally found a viable route. It was late in the night.
尽管绕了不少道，但最终顺利配送到223家商户，没晚点、没让想点外卖的普通人饿肚子。
Despite the detour, it eventually made it to 223 stores, with no delays or hunger among ordinary people who wanted to order takeout.
寿光菜农连夜采摘蔬菜援助武汉美菜早前一直主要服务餐饮商户，这次紧急疫情，不少普通家庭食材短缺，管理层决定，在保证餐饮、外卖需求的情况下，特殊时期为武汉等主要城市的家庭用户，逐步开放配送服务。
Shouguang vegetable farmers have long been the main food service providers in Wuhan, the emergency situation, many ordinary families food shortages, management decided to guarantee catering, take-out demand, the special period for Wuhan and other major urban households, gradually opening up distribution services.
在武汉，美菜的家庭用户下单数量在持续上涨，仅在1月26日，用美菜下单的用户类型中，家庭用户占80%。
Home orders for American food are on the rise in Wuhan, where households accounted for 80% of orders on Jan. 26 alone.
按照卫生防疫的标准，针对社区用户，美菜统一配送至社区防疫值班点，供家庭用户取货。
In accordance with the standards of hygiene and epidemic prevention, American dishes are uniformly distributed to community epidemic prevention duty points for home users to collect the goods.
除武汉以外，美菜其他各地城市也在根据当地防疫管理的情况，逐步开放供应家庭配送。
Besides Wuhan, other cities around the United States are also gradually opening up the supply of home distribution in accordance with the local epidemic prevention management situation.
更多的生鲜食品也正奔向武汉，保证普通市民家庭有菜吃。
More fresh food is rushing to Wuhan to ensure that ordinary citizens' families have food to eat.
1月26日，重庆市支援武汉市的数百吨蔬菜陆续抵达，包括南瓜、土豆、无筋豆、黄瓜等20多个品种。
On January 26, hundreds of tons of vegetables arrived in Chongqing, including pumpkins, potatoes, beans, cucumbers and more than 20 varieties.
这些蔬菜在武商、中百、中商三大商超平价售卖。
These vegetables are sold at super-par prices in Wuchang, Zhong100 and Zhongshang.
1月27日，饿了么协同“万吨通”供应商组织货源，在社区便利超市“有家”“Today等建立了100个生鲜便利服务站，并将进一步增加站点。
On January 27th, hungry people joined forces with suppliers to organize supplies and set up 100 new convenience stations in community-friendly supermarkets such as "Home" and "Today" and will further increase the number of stations.
武汉市民只需在当日20:00时前，通过饿了么下单，购买蔬菜水果、肉禽蛋奶等各种商品，第二天即可到服务站自行提取或请外卖小哥安全送上门。
Before 20: 00 on the same day, Wuhan people only need to order by hungry, vegetables and fruits, poultry and eggs milk and other commodities, the next day can go to the service stations to pick up their own or invited to the safe delivery of Brother.
1月28日，山东寿光首批350吨新鲜蔬菜启程，将无偿捐送给武汉。
January 28, Shandong Shouguang the first 350 tons of fresh vegetables departure, will be donated to Wuhan.
之后寿光也会每天提供600吨质优价廉蔬菜，持续供应10-15天。
Shouguang will also provide 600 tons of quality and inexpensive vegetables daily for a continuous supply of 10-15 days.
2020年新年注定不平凡，焦虑与感动交加，尽管谭德孝说从没想过当英雄，只想普普通通知足常乐，但普通人，也的确有英雄的一面。
The year 2020 is destined to be extraordinary, anxious and moving, although Tan Dexiao said he never wanted to be a hero, only ordinary people, but there is a heroic side.
