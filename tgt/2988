疫情冲击下，相对于集成程度较低的医疗制造业，以及部分进口替代为背景的光电子产业，武汉汽车工业在全球供应链中的地位更为关键降蕴彰 李皙寅苏鹏 | 文王延春 施智梁| 编辑这场突如其来的疫情不仅打乱了武汉汽车产业的生产节奏，也在很大程度上，对武汉的电子和光通信设备制造行业形成不小的冲击。
Under the impact of the epidemic, the Wuhan automobile industry's position in the global supply chain has become more critical than that of the less integrated medical manufacturing industry and the optoelectronics industry, which is partly based on import substitution. The sudden epidemic has not only disrupted the production pace of the Wuhan automobile industry, but has also greatly impacted Wuhan's electronics and optical equipment manufacturing industries.

小米集团海外销售总监娄晓音告诉《财经》记者：“疫情影响的品类广泛，涉及手机、耳机、移动电源、空净等电子产品，同时影响制造环节中芯片采购、开模、组装、配料、运输等环节。
"The epidemic affects a wide range of electronic products such as cell phones, headphones, mobile power supplies and air cleanliness, as well as chip procurement, tooling, assembly, batching and transportation in the manufacturing process," Lou Xiaoyin, millet group's overseas sales director, told Caijing.
上下游供应链链条中一两个环节停摆，整个供应链影响很大。
One or two links in the chain of upstream and downstream supply chain stop, the whole supply chain has a great impact.
”三年前，毕业于武汉大学的雷军带领小米、金山、顺为进驻武汉光谷，计划未来几年，在武汉打造出一整套的小米产业生态体系。
"Three years ago, Lei Junjun, a graduate of Wuhan University, led millet, Jinshan and Shun into Wuhan Guanggu, where he plans to build a complete ecosystem of millet industries in the next few years.
随着武汉封城，多个产线面临“封产”。
With the closure of Wuhan, a number of production lines face "production closure."
“我们正在评估海外供应链震动的程度，采取应急措施或者临时措施来努力维持供应链的稳定性，等待下半年海外市场复苏。
"We are assessing the extent of shocks in supply chains overseas and taking contingency or temporary measures to try to maintain the stability of the supply chain while waiting for overseas markets to recover in the second half of the year," he said.
”在武汉的支柱产业中，受疫情影响最严重的还有汽车制造业。
The automotive industry has also been hardest hit by the epidemic in Wuhan, the mainstay industry.
东风汽车集团是武汉乃至整个湖北的汽车龙头企业，雇用了约14万员工。
Dongfeng Motor Group is the leading automobile enterprise in Wuhan and throughout Hubei, employing about 140,000 employees.
武汉“封城”至今，东风汽车已经停产一个多月，“恢复生产的日期未知”。
Wuhan "closure" so far, Dongfeng Motor has been out of production for more than a month, "resumption of production date unknown."
像小米、东风汽车这样，在武汉的制造企业大多面临产业链的断链。
Like millet, Dongfeng Automobile, the manufacturing enterprises in Wuhan mostly face the break chain of the industrial chain.
武汉在汽车及零部件、光电子信息、生物医药及医疗器械三大领域拥有成规模的产业集群，在国内甚至全球供应链处于关键节点。
Wuhan has a large-scale industrial cluster in three fields: automobile and parts, optoelectronic information, biomedicine and medical devices.
这场疫情犹如一枚石子落入湖面，武汉产业的波心震动，产生的冲击波逐渐向国外层层荡漾。
This outbreak is like a stone fell into the lake, Wuhan industrial wave shock, the shock waves gradually ripple abroad layer upon layer.
中国湖北省武汉市政府的一位官员对《财经》记者表示：“虽然武汉的汽车产业几乎停摆，但通信电子产业并没有停工，短期内所受影响基本可控。
"Although the automobile industry in Wuhan has almost stopped, the telecommunications and electronics industry has not stopped and the short-term impact is largely controllable," an official from the Wuhan city government in Hubei Province told Caijing.
”2018年下半年以来，中国汽车市场消费疲软，汽车产业受到波及，但以通信电子、生物制药为代表的战略性新兴产业异军突起，成为武汉经济最亮丽的风景线。
Since the second half of 2018, Chinese auto market consumption has weakened and the auto industry has been affected, but strategic emerging industries, such as telecommunications electronics and biopharmaceuticals, have sprung up to become Wuhan's most beautiful economic landscape.
记者调查发现，由于假期延长和各省交通管制，目前通信电子、生物医药两大行业的人员归岗虽低于预期，但经过企业努力，疫情对两大行业影响较小，大多做到了不停工。
The reporter survey found that because of the extension of holidays and provincial traffic control, the current communication electronics, biomedical industry personnel return to work although lower than expected, but through enterprise efforts, the epidemic impact on the two industries is relatively small, most have not stopped work.
赛意企业研究所研究部主任唐大杰表示，通信电子、生物医药等上游高新企业，多是技术密集型，尚能通过远程办公解决复工问题，但是中下游产业链大多数是劳动力密集型制造企业，比如芯片的封测厂、手机代工厂，目前存在用工荒，企业产能减弱，资金链紧张。
Tang Dajie, director of research at the Saii Enterprise Institute, said upstream high-tech start-ups such as telecoms and electronics and biomedicine were more technology-intensive and could still solve the problem through telecommuting, but most of the middle- and downstream-chain industries were labor-intensive, such as chip-sealing plants and mobile-phone factories.
中国国内的招聘平台BOSS直聘与城市服务业招聘平台店长直聘联合发布“蓝领复工进度观察”，公布中国15个新一线城市三大行业蓝领平均复工为47%，其中武汉蓝领复工进度为33%。
BOSS, the domestic recruitment platform, and the director of the recruitment platform for the urban service industry jointly announced the blue-collar work schedule for the three major industries in China's 15 new industries at an average of 47%, with Wuhan Blue-collar work resuming at 33%.
武汉汽车业震荡武汉经济技术开发区内有一条长约13公里的“东风大道”，它纵贯南北，是全球汽车工业密集度最高的轴线之一。
Wuhan Automobile Industry Concussion Wuhan Economic and Technological Development Zone within the length of about 13 km "Dongfeng Boulevard," it longitudinal north and south, is one of the most dense axis of the global automobile industry.
7家整车企业错落其间，另有12个汽车总装工厂、500多家零部件企业，年产汽车过百万辆。
Seven full-scale enterprises in the middle, 12 automobile assembly plants, more than 500 parts and components enterprises, an annual production of more than one million cars.
武汉是当之无愧的中部车都，汽车产业已连续九年成为武汉第一支柱产业。
Wuhan is a well-deserved central car capital, automobile industry has become the first pillar industry in Wuhan for nine consecutive years.
2018年全市生产了170万辆汽车，占全国6％，其汽车及零部件产业产值达4000亿元，包括东风本田、东风、东风-PSA、东风-雷诺及上汽通用均有布局，囊括了法、日、美、自主四大车系。
In 2018, the city produced 1.7 million automobiles, accounting for 6 percent of the country.The output value of its auto and spare parts industry reached 400 billion yuan, including Dongfeng Honda, Dongfeng, Dongfeng-PSA, Dongfeng-Renault and SAIC General Motors.
这次不仅是武汉，以汉江为链，串联起包括武汉、襄阳、十堰等地在内的千里汽车工业带都陷入疫情危机。
This time, not only Wuhan, to the Han River as a chain, including Wuhan, Xiangyang, Shiyan and other places in the Qianli auto industry are in an epidemic crisis.
作为东风汽车的大本营，湖北聚集其过半的产能。
Hubei, the base of Dongfeng Motor, gathers more than half of its capacity.
为此，东风汽车人士告诉《财经》记者，公司管理层持续开会，研判上下游经销商、供应商的情况以便做好风险管理，掌握市场动态。
To this end, Dongfeng auto people told Caijing, the company's management continued to meet to review the situation of upstream and downstream distributors, suppliers in order to do a good job in risk management, grasp the market dynamics.
公司员工开始用电话、邮件、视频等方式展开远程网络办公。
Company employees began to use telephone, mail, video and other means of remote network work.
工厂停工的影响十分深远。
The impact of the plant shutdown has been profound.
BCG波士顿咨询在研报中提出，当地整车厂的持续停产还将导致：经销商缺乏所需车辆，原本激进的供应商也将面临哑火。
BCG Boston Consulting, in a research paper, said the continued shutdown of local car factories would also lead to dealers lacking the vehicles they needed and aggressive suppliers facing dud fires.
中国汽车流通协会副秘书长郎学红告诉《财经》记者，虽然现阶段经销商可以消化原有库存，但综合考虑厂商恢复生产的节奏，像日产、本田等部分车型将出现供给不足的情况。
China Automobile Circulation Association Deputy Secretary-General Lang Xuehong told Caijing that while dealers can digest existing stocks at this stage, given the pace at which manufacturers can resume production, some models, such as Nissan and Honda, will be in short supply.
业内曾期望当年SARS疫情后，售车需求井喷的盛况再现。
The industry had expected the SARS epidemic that year, sales demand boom again.
然而，汽车业咨询公司威尔森在研报中表示，今时不同往日，今年一季度全国销量将同比下降50%以上。
But unlike today, sales nationwide are set to fall by more than 50% year-on-year in the first quarter, according to research firm Wilson.
郎学红担心的是，现阶段虽然经销商已经开工八成，但整体消费需求不振，这会反作用于现有产能。
Lang Xuehong is worried that, although dealers have started 80% at this stage, but overall consumer demand is weak, which will counter-effect existing capacity.
受现阶段国内购车需求萎靡的影响，对于大规模生产，有的车企紧迫感并不强。
Due to the current weak demand for domestic car purchase, for large-scale production, some car enterprises are not a strong sense of urgency.
一位国际零部件巨头高管告诉《财经》记者，该零部件企业非湖北地区的工厂已经开工，明显感受到生产不同产品的整车厂需求迥然不同。
An international component giant executive told Caijing that factories in parts companies outside Hubei have already started, clearly feeling the disparate demand from the entire plant that makes different products.
湖北省拥有一个庞大的汽车零部件供应商网络，总共有超过700多家零部件供应商服务于国内整车厂，包括本土品牌及合资品牌，并有少部分出口国外客户。
Hubei province has a huge network of auto parts suppliers, with more than 700 parts suppliers serving domestic whole-car factories, including local brands and joint-venture brands, and a small number of foreign customers.
普华永道中国报告指出，全球前十大供应商约40%的生产工厂和研发中心处于疫情的重灾区。
PricewaterhouseCoopers China reports that about 40 percent of the world's top 10 suppliers' production plants and research and development centers are in the hardest hit areas of the epidemic.
产业集聚的规模效应，有效降低了研发、生产、物流等复合成本，在汽车业强调技术迭代、降本增效的今天变得尤为重要。
The scale effect of industrial agglomeration effectively reduces the complex cost of R & D, production and logistics.
不过，当企业开始过于倚重某一供应商，并强调低库存的精益管理时，就会使供应链变得异常脆弱。
However, when firms start to rely too heavily on one supplier and emphasize lean management of low inventories, this makes the supply chain extremely vulnerable.
汽车各种零部件适配性要求极高，备选零部件供应商的选择并非朝夕之功，甚至在部分领域难有备选方案，一旦关键零部件断供就意味着整个生产停滞。
Automobile components are highly adaptable, alternative parts suppliers are not selected overnight, and even in some areas there are few options, once critical parts are out of supply means the entire production is stalling.
一位武汉整车厂的工作人员对《财经》记者表示，公司按照3月10日复工的计划做准备，不过一切仍存变数。
A Wuhan factory worker told Caijing that the company was ready to resume work on March 10, but that everything was still uncertain.
吉利汽车是中国自主品牌，在吉利汽车武汉分公司担任中层管理的李平（化名）已经工作5年。
Geely Automobile is an independent Chinese brand and has been working for five years as a middle-level manager at Geely Automobile Wuhan Branch.
他说，“短期内，武汉车企都不具备复工条件，因为没法确保员工的安全。
"In the short term, Wuhan auto companies do not have the conditions to resume work because there is no way to ensure the safety of employees," he said.
”据了解，武汉整车和零部件企业的员工，大部分是湖北人，其中有不少一线员工都是在武汉周边县市居住，现在仍然被隔离在武汉周边的一些县市。
Wuhan is understood to be the vehicle and parts enterprise employees, most of Hubei people, many of the front-line staff are in Wuhan surrounding counties and cities, are still isolated in Wuhan around a number of counties.
李平目前就隔离在武汉市江汉区的一个小镇。
Li Ping is currently isolated in a small town in the Jianghan district of Wuhan.
对于各自隔离在家的湖北人来说，何时能返工、何时“封城”能结束都是未知数。
For the isolated Hubei people, it is uncertain when the rework will be completed and when the "closure" will be over.
中国汽车工业协会秘书长助理许海东告诉《财经》记者，综合分析来看，受新冠肺炎造成湖北及武汉当地汽车产业停产、进而扩散的影响或将持续到3月底。
Xu Haidong, assistant secretary-general of the China Automobile Industry Association, told Caijing that a comprehensive analysis shows that the impact of Xinguan Pneumonia on the local automobile industry in Hubei and Wuhan will continue until the end of March.
稍早前，北京奔驰的“求救信”走红网络。
Earlier, the Beijing Mercedes-Benz "SOS" popular network.
“公司仅有一天安全库存，一旦停限产超过一天，都将导致北京奔驰停产。
"The company only one day safe inventory, once the production limit of more than a day, will cause Beijing Benz to stop production.
如果北京奔驰不能在2月10日复工，经济损失每天将超4亿元人民币。
If Beijing Mercedes-Benz does not resume work on February 10, the economic losses will exceed 400 million yuan a day.
”之前北京奔驰请求天津武清区，能够批准其19家零部件企业于2月10日正常复工。
Earlier, Beijing Benz had asked Tianjin Wuqing District to allow its 19 parts companies to resume normal work on February 10.
目前，北京奔驰表示工厂已经开始单班复产。
At present, Beijing Mercedes Benz said that the factory has begun to resume production.
麻烦的是，一些国家和企业以防止新冠肺炎疫情扩散为由，拒绝已经订购的货物，撤销了原有订单。
The trouble is that some countries and companies have turned down orders and canceled original orders on the pretext of preventing the outbreak from spreading.
据中国汽车工业协会统计，已有超过60个国家发布了对中国的入境管制措施，这也造成中国汽车企业开拓海外市场受到阻碍，加大汽车及零部件出口的难度。
According to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, more than 60 countries have issued measures to control entry into China, making it difficult for Chinese companies to expand overseas markets and increase exports of cars and parts.
为此，部分零部件企业仍在争取优先确保海外供货，以维持此前积累下的良好口碑。
To this end, some parts companies are still trying to ensure that the priority of overseas supply, to maintain the previous accumulation of good reputation.
海外企业“过敏”也将面临高昂的代价。
Overseas companies will also face high costs.
在方向盘、转向柱和转向箱类别里，中国出口到美国的转向系统中有20%以上来自武汉。
Wuhan accounts for more than 20 per cent of China's exports to the US in the steering wheel, steering column and steering box categories.
这些工厂供应的任何一次中断，都可能对北美的组装工厂产生巨大的连锁反应。
Any interruption in the supply of these plants could have a huge ripple effect on assembly plants in North America.
如果需要重制模具、培训工人，整个工期需要三至九个月。
If it is necessary to remake the mould and train the workers, the whole construction period will take three to nine months.
对此，一位零部件企业高管认为，疫情属于不可抗力因素，汽车业是充分竞争的红海市场，抗风险与降成本，此事两难全，只能看各家企业家底的殷实程度，来设置风险应对计划。
A component executive said the situation was a force majeure and that the auto industry was a fully competitive market in the Red Sea, with risk-averse and cost-reducing costs.
电子信息、生物医药企业自救《财经》记者了解，早在“十二五”初期，武汉市政府就提出要打造电子信息、汽车、装备制造、钢铁等6个“千亿产业集群”，从排序上看，电子信息置于首位。
As early as the 12th Five-Year Plan period, the Wuhan government proposed to build six "trillion-billion-dollar industrial clusters" of electronic information, automobiles, equipment manufacturing and steel, ranking electronic information first.
武汉市发改局披露的信息，经过多年努力，腾讯、华为、小米、小红书等巨头逐步将分公司、研发中心等分支机构落户武汉，截至2018年底，总部、第二总部落户武汉的互联网公司有60多家，武汉市已经构建了通信光电子、能量光电子、消费光电子三大产业链。
According to the information disclosed by Wuhan Development and Reform Bureau, after many years of efforts, the giants Tencent, Huawei, millet and Little Red Book have gradually established branches and research and development centers in Wuhan.

目前武汉的光纤光缆生产规模全球第一，占中国国内市场的三分之二、占国际市场的四分之一；光电器件、光传输设备在中国国内市场占有率分别为60%、10%。
Wuhan is now the world's largest producer of fibre-optic cables, accounting for two-thirds of China's domestic market and a quarter of the international market.
这场突如其来的疫情不仅打乱了武汉汽车产业的生产节奏，也在很大程度上，对武汉的电子和光通信设备制造行业形成不小的冲击。
This sudden epidemic not only disrupted the production pace of Wuhan auto industry, but also to a large extent, Wuhan electronic and optical communication equipment manufacturing industry formed a considerable impact.
前述武汉市政府官员告诉《财经》记者，2016年中央政府在武汉市投建的长江存储国家存储基地，是中国发展集成电路产业的标志性企业之一，疫情已经使长江存储国家存储基地的产能降至日常产能的一半左右。
The Yangtze River Storage National Storage Base, built by the central government in Wuhan City in 2016, is one of the iconic enterprises in China to develop the integrated circuit industry, and the outbreak has reduced the capacity of the Yangtze River Storage National Storage Base to about half of its daily capacity, officials told Caijing.
疫情暴发以来，长江存储国家存储基地的运行情况，备受通信和电子产业内人士关注。
Since the outbreak of the outbreak, the Yangtze River storage national storage base operation, the communication and electronics industry has been concerned.
据该基地方面透露，目前公司积极协调政府部门，在保证安全前提下，生产经营正常有序进行，有效避免了停电停产可能带来的影响，与此同时，采用分区隔离管控措施，以避免外界病毒的带入，驻守在厂区的企业员工尚无感染病例。
At present, the company actively coordinates government departments to ensure the safety of the production and management of the normal and orderly, effectively avoiding the impact of power outage shutdown, and at the same time, the use of isolation measures to avoid the introduction of external viruses, factory staff stationed in the factory has no cases of infection.
“芯片”（半导体元件产品的统称）是通信和电子产业的基础元件。
"Chip" (a generic term for semiconductor devices) is the basic component of the communications and electronics industry.
《财经》记者了解到，疫情期间，武汉三大芯片企业——长江存储、武汉新芯、武汉弘芯均未中断生产。
Caijing reporter learned that during the epidemic period, Wuhan three big chip enterprises - Changjiang storage, Wuhan Xincore, Wuhan Hongcheng have not interrupted production.
武汉新芯公司董事长杨道虹表示，公司生产原料较为充足，对员工施行分级和封闭管理，除研发略有延迟外，企业基本保持计划进度。
Wuhan Xincore Company chairman Yang Dao Hong said that the company's production materials are more adequate, the staff of the classification and closed management, except for a slight delay in research and development, the enterprise basically maintain the schedule.
目前，该公司已向有关方面申请带宽扩容支持，以便能够保障5000多名公司员工同时远程在线办公。
The company has requested bandwidth expansion support to enable more than 5,000 employees to telecommute online.
芯谋咨询是一家中国国内领先的半导体产业研究机构，该机构人士预测，处于半导体产业链的上、中游企业仍多可持续运转，处于下游的芯片封测企业所面临的挑战最大，而挑战主要表现为人员到岗不全、物料运输不畅、资金周转不利等运营困难，以及下半年需消化大量积压需求的产能紧张。
Mimou Consulting, a leading semiconductor industry research firm in China, predicts that midstream and upper-middle-stream companies in the semiconductor industry are still operating sustainably, while downstream chip-sealing companies face the biggest challenges, mainly in the form of poorly staffed, poorly shipped materials and cash flow, as well as capacity constraints to absorb a large backlog of demand in the second half of the year.
整体上，疫情对中国集成电路行业的影响相对有限。
Overall, the epidemic has had a relatively limited impact on the Chinese integrated circuit industry.
多位业内人士提示，此次疫情对近两年新创的芯片企业的冲击均较为明显。
A number of industry sources suggested that the epidemic in the last two years of new chip enterprises are more obvious impact.
新创制造企业，特别是设备已经部分到位的，由于设备无法安装调试，工厂只能处于停顿状态，固定资产折旧、员工薪资等压力巨大，现金流中断风险较高，遭遇疫情冲击无异于雪上加霜。
New manufacturing enterprises, especially equipment already in place, because the equipment can not be installed and debugged, the factory can only be in a standstill, fixed assets depreciation, staff salaries and other great pressure, high risk of cash flow disruption, the impact of the epidemic is no different.
建议武汉市政府对这些新创芯片企业要格外关注，给予特别扶持。
It is suggested that Wuhan government should pay special attention to these new chip enterprises and give them special support.
按照专业人士的分析，一季度也是中国半导体产业的传统淡季。
According to the analysis of professionals, the first quarter of China's semiconductor industry is also the traditional off-season.
随着疫情的逐步缓解与好转，预计二季度尤其是下半年中国半导体产业将会迎来报复性反弹。
With the gradual alleviation and improvement of the epidemic, the second quarter, especially in the second half of China's semiconductor industry is expected to usher in a retaliatory rebound.
一旦疫情结束，前期被抑制的产业需求将会充分释放，中国半导体产业长期向好的趋势不会改变。
Once the epidemic is over, pent-up industrial demand will be fully unleashed and the long-term positive trend in China's semiconductor industry will not change.
生物医药及医疗器械企业也是武汉市的一个重要支柱产业。
Biomedical and medical device enterprises are also an important pillar industry in Wuhan.
据了解，武汉总计有1500余家生物医药及医疗器械企业，其中包括美国辉瑞、德国拜耳、德国费森尤斯卡比等世界500强企业，也有中国的人福医药集团、国药控股等大型药企。

武汉作为全国重要的制造业基地，这次在疫情中受到重创，有待一段时间恢复元气。
Wuhan, an important manufacturing base in China, has been hard hit by the epidemic and will take some time to recover.
但天风证券宏观分析师宋雪涛认为，未来随着疫情逐渐减弱，武汉市的消费和服务业均会逐渐修复，医药生物的脉冲也会逐渐平息。
But Sung Xuetao, a macro-analyst at Tianfeng Securities, thinks that with the gradual weakening of the epidemic in the future, consumption and service industries in Wuhan will gradually repair, and the pulse of medicine and biology will gradually subside.
长期来看，疫情对制造业产业链的影响也会随着疫情减弱、工业生产恢复逐渐消失。
In the long run, the impact of the epidemic on the manufacturing industry chain will gradually disappear as the epidemic weakens and industrial production recovers.
对于企业来讲，疫情过后，企业在供应链规划与管理上如何提升韧性，重构供应链危机的应对体系，才是最切实的问题。
For enterprises, the most effective problem is how to improve the resilience and reconstruct the coping system of the supply chain crisis after the epidemic.
