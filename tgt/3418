一直以来，传染病的防治强调的都是早期介入。
The prevention and treatment of infectious diseases has always emphasized early intervention.
如果能更早监测病例，“当然是能更早遏制”，一位中疾控领导表示，“我想将来我们一定都会回过头来去看，去仔细考察，做一些包括技术上的、深入的调查和回顾。
If cases could be monitored earlier, "certainly sooner," says one CDC leader. "I think we'll all look back in the future, look at it carefully, and do some technical, in-depth investigations and reviews.

长江日报 陈卓摄文 | 新京报记者魏芙蓉 实习生 杜萌 张逸凡编辑｜陈晓舒校对| 李项玲►本文约6326字，阅读全文约需13分钟2019年12月份，一种尚不知名的病毒开始在武汉传播。
Changjiang Daily Chen ZhuoWen & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
最初的这一个月，一切都未被警觉。
For the first month, everything went unnoticed.
12月31日武汉市卫健委发布的官方消息，当时的武汉“已发现27例病例”。
Wuhan "has found 27 cases," according to the official news released by the Wuhan Health Commission on December 31.
据权威人士证实，12月的这些病例并没有通过网络直报进入到“中国疾病预防控制信息系统”（简称“直报系统”）中，启动早期监测和预警。
Authorities confirmed that the cases in December were not reported directly via the Internet into the China Disease Prevention and Control Information System (CDCIS) to trigger early surveillance and early warning.
中疾控一位现任领导告诉新京报记者，在还未明确“新冠”病名疫情之初，按照规定，“直报”其实可以走两条途径，“一个是走传染病疫情报告流程，就是所谓的大疫情系统，按‘其他类别’来报；另一个是走不明原因肺炎的诊断、报告流程”。
A current CDC leader told the Beijing News that in the early days of the outbreak of the disease, "direct reporting" could actually follow two paths, "one is to follow the reporting process of infectious diseases, or the so-called pandemic system, reporting according to 'other categories'; the other is to diagnose and report pneumonia due to unknown causes.
而不管通过哪个途径，只要填写传染病报告卡上报，都会进入到直报系统当中，任一级别的CDC都能看到病例信息。
Regardless of the route used to fill in the infectious disease report card, it will be entered into the direct reporting system and CDC will be able to see the case information at any level.
但在12月份的武汉，直报系统被“搁置”了。
But in Wuhan in December, the direct reporting system was "shelved."
官方认可的新冠疫情上报第一人，湖北省中西医结合医院的呼吸与危重医学科主任张继先告诉新京报记者，“发现（不明原因病例）后，我首先报告给院感控，再报告给医务部、院长，这是我作为科室主任的职责”，但关于初期的传染病报告卡有无填报，何时填报，张继先表示，“不清楚，我没有做统计。
Zhang Jixian, director of respiratory and critical medicine at the Hubei combined hospital, told the Beijing News that after discovering the case, I first reported it to the hospital and then to the Ministry of Medicine and Dean, which is my responsibility as the department director.
”武汉一家三甲医院的呼吸内科副主任医师则称，“不知道病名，没有确诊，怎么报？这个传染病报告卡的病因，是需要填得非常明确的”。
Wuhan, a third A hospital deputy director of respiratory medicine said, "do not know the name of the disease, not confirmed, how to report? The etiology of this infectious disease report card, need to be filled out very clearly.
中国疾控中心副主任冯子健、原副主任杨功焕均向媒体证实，武汉通过“网络直报”方式上报不明原因肺炎病例，始于1月3日。
Feng Zijian, deputy director of the China CDC, and Yang Gonghuan, former deputy director, confirmed to the media that Wuhan had reported cases of unspecified pneumonia through a "direct internet newspaper" since January 3.
疫情初期，“网络直报”滞后，那么这套建在非典之后、国家花重金打造、最快可“2小时直达”的网络直报系统，到底在哪个环节失灵了？如何定义“不明原因肺炎”？2019年12月26日，一对老年夫妻因身体不适分别在湖北省中西医结合医院两个科室就诊。
In the early stages of the epidemic, the "direct Internet newspaper" lagged behind, so where did the system fail after SARS and the state spent huge sums of money to provide "two hours of direct access"?
老太太因为发烧气喘看了呼吸科，老头因为浑身没劲去了精神内科。
The old lady looked at the respiratory department with a fever and the old man went to the Department of Psychiatry because he was tired.
次日，在神经内科对患者的常规检查中，老头的CT结果显示其肺部有问题。
The next day, during a routine examination of the patient in the neurology department, the old man's CT scan showed that he had lung problems.
院内呼吸科医生被请到精神内科对该病例进行会诊，同日，老人在呼吸科就诊的妻子肺部影像也显示出了与普通病毒性肺炎不同的病变。
Hospital ventilators were referred to the Department of Psychiatry for a consultation on the case. On the same day, the lung image of his wife, who was admitted to the respiratory department, also showed signs of lesions different from those of common viral pneumonia.
“两个人的CT很像，又是夫妻，我们就开始警觉了。
"The CT of two people is very similar, is a husband and wife, we began to be alert.
”该医院呼吸与危重医学科主任张继先说。
Zhang Jixian, director of respiratory and critical medicine at the hospital, said.
而这一天，除两位老人外，一名来自华南海鲜市场的商户肺部也出现了类似的感染。
On that day, in addition to two old people, a merchant lung from the South China seafood market also had a similar infection.
怀疑是传染性疾病，张继先坚持让陪同老人检查的儿子也在医院做了CT检查。
Suspected of contagious disease, Zhang Jixian insisted that his son, who accompanied the elderly for examination, also had a CT examination at the hospital.
结果显示，儿子的肺部也出现了和父母一样的病变。
The results showed that his son's lungs were suffering from the same diseases as his parents.
“哪有一家三口都得一样的病呢？”为了找出病因，12月27日，四位病患在张继先的安排下先后做了甲乙流、合胞病毒、腺病毒、鼻病毒、衣原体和支原体等检查，结果均显示阴性。
To find out the cause of the disease, four patients underwent negative tests - A-B flow, syncytial virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, chlamydia and mycoplasma - in order to find out the cause.
“不是这些病，不是我们常见的病，只能是新的。
"It's not these diseases, it's not our usual illnesses, it's only new.
”张继先在当天就将四名病人的情况上报至医院感染管理科，医院随后又上报至江汉区疾控中心。
Zhang reported the condition of the four patients to the Infection Management Section of the hospital that day, which in turn reported the case to the CDC.
SARS之后，原卫生部曾于2004年制定的《全国不明原因肺炎病例监测实施方案》，2007年更新为《全国不明原因肺炎病例监测、排查和管理方案》（以下简称方案）。
Following SARS, the National Programme for Monitoring Cases of Unknown Causes of Pneumonia, developed by the former Ministry of Health in 2004, was updated in 2007 as the National Programme for Monitoring, Screening and Managing Cases of Unknown Causes of Pneumonia (hereinafter referred to as the Programme).
其中规定，各级各类医疗机构的医务人员发现符合不明原因肺炎定义的病例后，应立即报告医疗机构相关部门，由医疗机构在 12 小时内组织本单位专家组进行会诊和排查，仍不能明确诊断的，应立即填写传染病报告卡，注明“不明原因肺炎”并进行网络直报。
It stipulates that medical personnel of all types of medical institutions at all levels should immediately report to the relevant departments of medical institutions for consultation and check-up by their own expert groups within 12 hours, and if they are still unable to make a clear diagnosis, they should immediately fill out a report card for infectious diseases, indicate "pneumonia for unknown reasons" and report directly on the network.
《全国不明原因肺炎病例监测、排查和管理方案》（2007）中所附的排查流程图。
Flow Chart of Screening attached to the National Program for Monitoring, Screening and Management of Unknown Cases of Pneumonia (2007).
国家卫健委第二批访汉的专家组成员蒋荣猛告诉新京报记者，“呼吸道疾病是世界都重点关注的疾病。
"Respiratory diseases are the focus of the world," Jiang Rong, a member of the national health committee's second visit to China, told the Beijing News
方案的监测目的实际上非常明确，首先是要发现SARS和禽流感，其次是要通过监测发现一些未知的、新的病原体，尤其是和呼吸道疾病相关的不明原因肺炎。
The programme's monitoring purposes are in fact very clear, starting with the detection of SARS and avian influenza and, secondly, with the detection of unknown, new pathogens, in particular unexplained pneumonia associated with respiratory diseases.
”如何定义“不明原因肺炎”？上述方案规定，同时具备以下4条不能做出明确诊断的肺炎病例：发热(腋下体温≥38℃)；具有肺炎的影像学特征；发病早期白细胞总数降低或正常，或淋巴细胞分类计数减少；经规范抗菌药物治疗3～5天，病情无明显改善或呈进行性加重。
The plan calls for four cases of pneumonia that cannot be clearly diagnosed: fever (armpit temperature at 38 ° C); imaging features of pneumonia; decreased or normal leukocyte counts in the early stages of onset, or reduced lymphocyte classification; and no significant improvement or progressive aggravation in three to five days of standard antimicrobial therapy.
蒋荣猛称，方案中“不明原因肺炎”其实并不是一个严谨的医学概念。
Jiang said the "unspecified pneumonia" in the plan is not really a rigorous medical concept.
他告诉新京报记者，医生在临床中更加关注的是社区性获得肺炎中，即有传染性、病情进展快的病毒性肺炎。
He told the Beijing News that doctors are more concerned about community-based pneumonia, a viral pneumonia that is contagious and progresses quickly.
但现实是，临床上对社区获得性肺炎的病原学诊断普遍不高，在世界范围内，即便是发达国家对社区获得性肺炎的病原学诊断率只有30%~40%，而且不同级别的医院，不同地区病原诊断率差异明显，尤其是对病毒性肺炎。
But the reality is that the etiological diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia is generally not high, even in developed countries, the rate of pathogenic diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia is only 30% ~ 40% worldwide, and there are significant differences in the rates of pathogen diagnosis between different levels of hospitals, especially for viral pneumonia.
正是因为，“大部分病毒性肺炎找不到病原体，也很难做到所有的不明原因肺炎病例都能进行上报、进入到该方案的排查流程中。
Precisely because "most viral pneumonia cannot find a pathogen, it is difficult to report all cases of unexplained pneumonia to the screening process."
”向妮娟、冯子健等人2010年发表的论文《2004-2009年中国不明原因肺炎病例报告情况分析》指出，大部分医生不清楚“不明原因肺炎”病例的定义，也不了解报告程序会影响病例的报告。
An analysis of the reported cases of unspecified pneumonia in China in 2004-2009, published by Nijuan and Feng Zijian et al., in 2010, shows that most doctors are unaware of the definition of cases of "unexplained pneumonia" and of reports that the reporting process will affect cases.
此外，医疗机构因未能从病例报告、标本采集和送检中获知对临床有意义的结果，也会影响医生继续报告的积极性。
In addition, the failure of medical institutions to obtain clinically meaningful results from case reports, specimen collection and referrals also affects the willingness of doctors to continue reporting.
上述中疾控领导介绍，确诊“不明原因肺炎”，“要有院内专家组的会诊，可能还要区县一级的专家组要会诊”。
The above-mentioned CDC leadership said that the diagnosis of "unknown causes of pneumonia," "to have hospital expert consultation, and possibly district-level experts to consult."
蒋荣猛介绍，对临床上怀疑为不明原因肺炎的病例，后续的样本检测和会诊机制是排查过程中非常的重要的一环。
Jiang Rong Meng introduced that for the clinically suspected case of pneumonia, the follow-up sample detection and consultation mechanism is very important in the screening process.
通常，如果医院有检测能力的，会检测常见的病原体，如流感、禽流感、SARS、腺病毒、支原体等。
Usually, if the hospital has the ability to detect common pathogens, such as influenza, avian influenza, SARS, adenovirus, mycoplasma, etc.
如果经院内会诊，不能明确诊断的要立即按“不明原因肺炎”进行网络直报，同时向辖区疾控中心报告，把样本送至辖区疾控中心进一步检测。
If the hospital consultation, unable to clearly diagnose the "unknown causes of pneumonia" immediately reported to the network, and reported to the jurisdiction of the CDC, sent samples to the jurisdiction CDC for further testing.
“一旦进行网络直报，任一级别的CDC都能看到（病例信息）。
"CDC at any level will be able to see [case information] once a direct network report is made.
”按照方案要求，辖区疾控机构接到不明原因肺炎病例报告后，应在24小时内对病例完成初步流行病学调查，将调查结果及时向主管卫生行政部门报告，提出相应的工作建议。
According to the plan, the jurisdiction's CDC should complete a preliminary epidemiological investigation of the case within 24 hours after receiving a report of an unidentified pneumonia case, and report the results of the investigation to the competent health administration department in a timely manner and make corresponding recommendations for its work.
然后医院根据上一级卫生行政部门组织的专家会诊意见和检测结果对传染病报告卡进行订正。
The hospital then amends the infectious disease report card on the basis of expert consultations and test results organized by the health administration department at the next higher level.
之所以逐级报告送检，蒋荣猛介绍，一方面是由于上级疾控中心拥有更完备的监测技术，“例如中疾控，这10年来储备了大概300多种病原体的检测技术”。
The reason why the successive reports were sent for inspection, Jiang Rong, on the one hand, is because the CDC superior has better monitoring technology, "such as disease control, in the last 10 years, stored about 300 kinds of pathogen detection technology.
另一方面，也能快速展开流行病调查。
On the other hand, epidemiological investigations can be conducted quickly.
医护人员正在紧张工作。
The paramedics are working very hard.
图片来自网络缺席的“网络直报”后来的两天时间里，张继先所在的科室又陆续接诊了3名类似症状的患者。
Pictures come from the absence of the network of "direct online newspaper" in the next two days, Zhang Jixian's department has been receiving three similar symptoms of the patients.
2019年12月29日，湖北省中西医结合医院进行了首次专家联合会诊讨论，来自医院呼吸科和院感办的多名专家经讨论后发现这7名病例影像学特殊，症状类似，其中4名病例都有华南海鲜市场的接触史。
On December 29, 2019, the Hubei Province Chinese and Western Medical Association Hospital held the first joint consultation of experts. After discussion, experts from the respiratory department of the hospital and the hospital sensuality found that the seven cases had special imaging features with similar symptoms, four of which had a history of exposure to the South China seafood market.
院方再次将此情况向省、市卫健委报告。
The hospital will again report this situation to the provincial and municipal health committees.
当天，省、市卫健委指派了相关工作人员前往该院进行流行病学调查工作。
On the same day, the provincial and municipal health committee appointed relevant staff to the hospital for epidemiological investigation.
湖北省中西医结合医院此时并没有选择填写传染病报告卡进行网络直报，而是直接报给了上级主管单位卫健委。
Hubei combined Chinese and Western medicine hospital at this time did not choose to fill out the infectious disease report card for direct reporting, but directly reported to the higher-level health care unit.
据公开资料显示，2003年“非典”之后，我国在疾控系统打造了“直报系统”。
According to open data, after SARS in 2003, China built a "direct reporting system" in the disease control system.
该系统由中央和地方投资共建，包含传染病、突发公共卫生事件、出生死亡登记、健康危害因素等22个监测子系统。
The system, built with central and local investment, includes 22 monitoring subsystems for infectious diseases, public health emergencies, birth death registration and health hazard factors.
截至2011年年底，该系统已覆盖全国100％的疾控机构、98％的县级及以上医疗卫生机构和88％的乡镇卫生院。
By the end of 2011, the system had reached 100 per cent of the country's disease control units, 98 per cent of district-level and above health-care facilities and 88 per cent of township hospitals.
张继先告诉新京报记者，疫情之前，院内传染病报告卡的填报一般是由临床医生来做，但1月初开始，前来就诊的不明原因肺炎患者陡增，“每天光是看病人就忙得稀里哗啦，我一天看两三百个门诊，根本忙不过来”，她表示，“它（填卡）需要的信息量太多，非常详细，专门的一个人搞不定。
"Before the outbreak, hospital infectious disease report cards were filled in by clinicians," Zhang told the Beijing News. "Starting in early January, the number of patients with unexplained pneumonia surged." I was so busy just seeing patients every day that I could not see two or three hundred clinics a day, "she said.
要填写电话号码、身份证号码、发病时间是哪一天、发的是什么病……”“发现（不明原因肺炎病例）后，我首先报告给院感控，再报告给医务部、院长，这是我作为科室主任的职责”，但关于初期的传染病报告卡有无填报，何时填报，张继先表示，“不清楚，我没有做统计。
To fill out the telephone number, identity card number, the date of the onset of illness, what illness... "" I first reported to the hospital sensorial control and then to the Ministry of Medicine and Dean, which is my responsibility as the director of the department.
”张继先所在的湖北省中西医结合医院也许不是最早接诊不明原因肺炎的医疗机构。
The Hubei combined Chinese and Western medicine hospital, where Zhang was located, may not have been the first hospital to receive unexplained pneumonia.
同样是早期接诊不明原因肺炎的患者还有武汉市中心医院，该院急诊科主任艾芬告诉新京报记者，南京路院区的急诊科12月16日左右接诊到第一例不明原因肺炎的患者，南京路院区12月共接诊到两例类似患者，均在当月转诊到呼吸科，两名患者检查结果12月30日出来后，他们对这个病毒立马引起了警觉。
The first case of unexplained pneumonia was also reported at Wuhan Central Hospital, where the emergency department director, Aifen, told the Beijing News. The emergency department of the Nanjing Road hospital admitted the first case of unexplained pneumonia around December 16.
后湖院区12月也陆续有肺炎患者，但“不知道里面有多少是新型冠状病毒。
Houhu District in December also have pneumonia patients, but "do not know how much is the new coronavirus.
”湖北省中西医结合医院（也称湖北省新华医院）。
"Hubei combined Chinese and Western medicine hospital (also known as Xinhua Hospital in Hubei Province).
图片来自医院官网艾芬表示，碰到传染病，临床医生除了填写传染病报告卡，也会告知主任和院内相关部门。
In the event of an infectious disease, the clinician will not only fill out the infectious disease report card, but also inform the director and hospital authorities, the hospital official said.
“填写传染病报告卡是医生的基本功。
Filling in a infectious disease report card is a basic skill for a doctor.
之前碰到肝炎、肺结核这样的我们会直接在电脑里填了（报告卡）。
Before encounter hepatitis, tuberculosis and so on we can fill in directly in the computer (report card).
但这回是未知的，肯定第一时间打电话通知他们（公共卫生科）了”。
But this time it's unknown, and I'm sure I'll call them first. "
几天前，一份武汉中心医院公共卫生科工作人员撰写的《新型冠状病毒疫情处置情况说明》（以下称《疫情处置说明》）流传开来，新京报记者向该院多位医生核实了该文件的真实性，一名医生称，该份《疫情处置说明》介绍的是后湖和南京路两个院区的情况。
A few days ago, a statement on the handling of the new coronavirus outbreak written by the public health staff of Wuhan Central Hospital (hereinafter referred to as the "Statement on the Handling of Coronavirus") was widely circulated.
在该份《疫情处置说明》中，该院公共卫生科在12月29日接后湖院区急诊科医生汇报，称科室接诊了4例来自华南海鲜市场的病人，CT检查均显示肺部有问题，有病毒性肺炎的表现。
In the Statement, the hospital's public health division reported on December 29 that the department had treated four patients from the South China seafood market. CT tests showed lung problems and signs of viral pneumonia.
该院在当天进行院内专家会诊后立即将情况电话汇报至市、区疾控中心。
The hospital in the same day after the hospital expert consultation immediately reported the situation to the city, district CDC.
区疾控中心和应急办也于当天在院内完成了流行病学调查和采样工作。
The District CDC and the Emergency Response Office also completed epidemiological surveys and sampling at the compound on the same day.
12月31日和1月3日，医院曾两次致电江汉区疾控中心，先后询问采样结果，以及“是否应该上报传染病报告卡”。
On December 31 and January 3, the hospital called the CDC twice to inquire about the sampling results and whether the infectious disease report card should be reported.
其得到的回复是“对于此类特殊传染病，等上级通知后再上报，具体上报病种等通知。
The response is "for this kind of special infectious diseases, after the superior's notification to report, specific reporting of diseases and other notifications.
”不断被提高的报卡“权限”国家卫健委第一批专家组于12月31日首次抵达武汉，武汉市卫健委当时公布消息称“已发现27例病例”。
The first batch of experts from the National Fitness and Health Commission arrived in Wuhan on December 31, when the city's health committee announced it had found 27 cases.
直到1月4日，武汉市中心医院才收到市卫健委下发的不明原因的病毒性肺炎指导手册，其中规定“对于疑似病例，院内12小时组织专家会诊，会诊不能排除时应立即上传传染病报告卡”。
It was not until January 4 that Wuhan Central Hospital received a guidebook on unspecified viral pneumonia issued by the municipal health committee, which stipulates that "in suspected cases, expert consultation will be organized within 12 hours in the hospital, and the infectious disease report card should be uploaded as soon as the consultation cannot be ruled out."
上述《疫情处置说明》显示，1月5日，规定又发生了变化。
According to the above-mentioned Epidemic Disposal Statement, on 5 January, the regulations were changed again.
辖区卫健委组织会议，会上辖区意见显示：疑似病例，院内专家会诊不能排除后，应上报区卫健委，由区级组织专家会诊，不能排除后上报传染病报告卡。
District health care committee organization meeting, the jurisdiction opinion shows: suspected cases, hospital expert consultation can not be ruled out, should be reported to the District Health Commission, the district-level organization of expert consultation, can not exclude the report card of infectious diseases.
按照如上要求，在武汉市中心医院1月8日至1月10日分批上报了共14张传染病报告卡后，接市、省级卫健委相关工作人员的口头通知，传染病报告卡的权限在其后数天内仍在不断发生变化，经历了从“区级专家会诊后报卡”，到“省市联合报卡”，再到“经区、市、省级逐级检测，仍为不明原因肺炎后，经省卫健委同意才能进行病例信息上报”。
In accordance with the above requirements, after Wuhan Central Hospital reported a total of 14 infectious disease report cards in batches from January 8 to January 10, the competence of the infectious disease report cards continued to change in the following days.
武汉市中心医院。
Wuhan Central Hospital.
图片来自网络值得注意的是，无论是在2007年版的方案还是1月4日该市卫健委下发的书面的“不明原因的病毒性肺炎指导手册”中，针对不明原因肺炎病例传染病报告卡的上报权限和时限要求均是：院内12小时组织专家会诊，会诊不能排除时立即上传传染病报告卡。
Both the 2007 edition of the program and the written "Guide Manual for Unexplained Viral Pneumonia" issued by the city's health committee on January 4 require that the reporting authority and time limit for reporting infectious disease cards for cases of unexplained pneumonia be as follows: specialist consultations are organized within 12 hours and infectious disease report cards are uploaded as soon as consultations cannot be ruled out.
方案中虽然也注明县、市、省三级专家组会诊的流程，但其会诊的目的是“排除SARS和人禽流感”以及在诊断结果出来后需“原报告单位网上订正为诊断疾病或其他不明原因疾病”。
Although the program also indicates the process of consultation at the county, city and provincial levels, the purpose of the consultation is to "eliminate SARS and human avian influenza" and to "revise the original reporting unit's website to diagnose diseases or other unspecified diseases" when the results are available.
也就是说，原本由医院会诊后可上报传染病报告卡的权限，在疫情初期的武汉，被不断“提高”了。
That is, the original hospital consultation can report infectious disease report card authority, in the early stage of the epidemic in Wuhan, has been "improved."
1月10日后，武汉市中心医院停止了报卡。
After January 10, Wuhan Central Hospital stopped reporting cards.
在此之前，艾芬所在的急诊科，传染病报告卡的填写，都是交由医院公共科负责。
Prior to this, the emergency department, the infectious disease report card filled in by the hospital public office is responsible.
3月12日，新京报记者致电该医院公共科，工作人员拒绝接受采访，表示要先联系宣传科。
On 12 March, journalists from the Beijing News called the public section of the hospital and staff refused to be interviewed, saying that they would first contact the Advocacy Section.
记者多次致电宣传科，截至发稿前均无人接听。
Reporters repeatedly called the propaganda section, as of the draft before no one answered.
不同地区“传染病报告卡”存细微差别按照常规程序，填写传染病报告卡是病例信息进入网络直报系统的第一步。
According to the routine procedure, filling out the infectious disease report card is the first step for the case information to enter the network direct reporting system.
据《传染病信息报告管理规范》，各级各类医疗卫生机构中首诊医生只要发现临床传染病例，都需在规定时限内将信息报告至医院传染病科，由专人填传染病报告卡，登录网络直报系统，录入信息、上报。
According to the "Standards for the Reporting and Management of Infectious Disease Information," first-time doctors in all types of medical and health institutions at all levels should report any clinical infectious diseases to the infectious diseases department within a specified time limit.
但武汉一家三甲医院的呼吸内科副主任医师告诉新京报记者，其所在的科室在临床上碰到的最多的传染性疾病为肺结核，这类疾病的确诊、填卡上报有一套熟悉的流程；但对于此次大多数人经验之外的新冠肺炎，疫情初显苗头时，“不知道病名，没有确诊，怎么报？这个卡的病因，是需要填得非常明确的。
But the deputy director of respiratory medicine at a three-A hospital in Wuhan told the Beijing News that the most common infectious disease encountered by his department was tuberculosis. However, there was a familiar procedure for the diagnosis and reporting of such diseases.
”上述武汉医生所指的“不能确诊就没法填报”是指，若面临已知病名的39种“法定传染病”，医生在填写传染病报告卡时可以直接勾选病名，但他看到的传染病报告卡上没有可供选择的“不明原因肺炎”病种选项。
Wuhan doctors refer to 39 "statutory infectious diseases" for which the name is known. Doctors can tick the name of the disease directly when filling out a communicable disease report card, but the infectious disease report card he sees does not have an "unknown pneumonia" option.
“如何勾选病种、写病因”首先就为填卡带来困难。
"How to select the disease, write the etiology" first for filling in the card difficulties.
新京报记者从多地区不同医院了解到，不同地区的传染病报告卡在也存在一些细微差别。
Newspaper Beijing News learned from different hospitals in many areas that there are some nuance differences in the reports of infectious diseases in different regions.
南方医科大学附属第三医院的一名呼吸内科医生向新京报记者展示了其在医院使用的传染病报告卡，与武汉地区不同的是，“不明原因肺炎”在“其他法定管理以及重点检测疾病”一栏中是作为一类可直接勾选的选项。
A respiratory physician at the Third Hospital attached to the Southern Medical University showed Xinjing News his report card for infectious diseases used in hospitals. Unlike in Wuhan, "unknown pneumonia" is considered a direct option in the "other statutory management and key detection diseases" column.
内蒙古的呼吸科医生也向记者表示，其所用的传染病报告卡也有可供直接勾选的“不明原因肺炎”选项。
Nei Mongol's respiratory doctor also told reporters that his infectious disease report card also had the "unspecified pneumonia" option available for direct selection.
广东省传染病报告卡（左）上，“不明原因肺炎”是可直接勾选的选项，方案所附的传染病报告卡（右）上则没有这个选项。
On the Guangdong Infectious Disease Report Card (left), "Unexplained Pneumonia" is an option that can be checked directly. This option is not available on the infectious disease report card (right) attached to the scheme.
受访者供图两位医生均表示，在实际操作中，当在短时内收到多个类似症状的不明原因肺炎病人，或不明的肺炎病例具有明显传染性特征时，会在传染病报告卡上直接勾选“不明原因肺炎”上报。
Both doctors indicated that, in practice, when patients with unexplained pneumonia with similar symptoms or cases of unexplained pneumonia had obvious infectious characteristics within a short period of time, "unidentified pneumonia" was reported directly on the infectious disease report card.
就上述武汉医生所指出的填报问题，上述中疾控领导告诉新京报记者，在还未明确“新冠”病名的疫情之初，按照规定，“直报”其实可以走两条途径，“一个是走传染病疫情报告流程，就是所谓的大疫情系统，按其他类别来报；另一个是走不明原因肺炎的诊断、报告流程”。
To the above-mentioned Wuhan doctor pointed out the filing problem, the above-mentioned CDC leadership told Xinjing News that before the outbreak of the disease name, "direct reporting" can actually take two ways, "one is to follow the infectious disease reporting process, or the so-called pandemic system, reported by other categories; the other is the diagnosis and reporting process of unidentified pneumonia."
该领导进一步解释道：前者即使报告卡上没有不明肺炎的病种直接勾选，但可以在“其他”类别中填写，注明“不明原因肺炎”上报。
The leader further explained that even if the report card did not contain a direct check of the disease with unknown pneumonia, it could be filled out in the "other" category and reported as "pneumonia due to unknown causes."
如果有更早的介入，“当然是能更早遏制”对于直报系统的接收机构中疾控而言，“我们天天有人在（监测系统）看，只要是聚集性的上报，都会引起我们的注意：在开始的阶段就要关注病例有没有增长，我们还会进一步分析讨论，在一定时候直接介入调查。
If there had been an earlier intervention, "certainly sooner," for CDC, the recipient of the direct reporting system, "we have people on a daily basis who look at [the surveillance system] and notice that there is no increase in the number of cases at the beginning.
” 上述中疾控领导对新京报记者说。
'The CDC chief told the Beijing News.
他称，通过监测系统，中疾控对不明原因肺炎的聚集性病例是非常敏感的。
Through the surveillance system, he said, the disease is very sensitive to cases of aggregation of unspecified pneumonia.
“不明原因肺炎，我们过去关注的重点是新型流感的跨种传播：即动物流感跨到人身上，然后导致流感的大流行。
"Unexplained pneumonia, where we used to focus on cross-species transmission of new influenza: animal flu that crosses humans and then causes an influenza pandemic.
”近年来，不明原因肺炎病例在全国时有发生。
In recent years, cases of unexplained pneumonia have occurred across the country.
蒋荣猛称，近年来H7N9、H5N6等不同亚型禽流感基本上是通过这套直报系统发现的。
Jiang claimed that in recent years the H7N9, H5N1 and other subtypes of avian influenza had been detected largely through the straight reporting system.
但他表示，该方案已经使用十六年，“由于种种原因，对不明原因肺炎发现的敏感性以及对样本的及时检测性等方面，还需要大家去总结一些经验，怎样把流程做得更好更完善。
However, he said the program has been in use for 16 years, "due to a variety of reasons, the sensitivity of the discovery of unknown pneumonia and the timely detection of samples, we need to summarize some experience, how to do a better and better process.
”2017年，中国疾病预防控制中心卫生应急中心王宇发表论文《不明原因肺炎监测系统评价》，文章提到，在2004年到2016年年间，全国共上报1666例不明原因肺炎病例，其中8%为人禽流感病例，76%的上报病例诊断为其他疾病，如病毒性肺炎、细菌性肺炎、未知病原体肺炎等。
In 2017, Wang Yu, a health emergency center at the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, published a paper entitled "Evaluation of Unexplained Pneumonia Surveillance System," which notes that between 2004 and 2016, 1,666 cases of unspecified pneumonia were reported nationwide, including 8 per cent of human cases of avian influenza and 76 per cent of reported cases of other diseases, such as viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia and pneumonia, unknown pathogens.
文章同时指出，医院内有大量符合不明原因肺炎定义的病例，但上报率低，大部分符合不明原因肺炎定义的患者在病例上报至监测系统之前的某一层面被“过滤”了。
The article also points out that there are a large number of cases that fall within the definition of unspecified pneumonia, but they are underreported and most patients who meet the definition of unexplained pneumonia are "filtered" at some level before cases are reported to the surveillance system.
向妮娟、冯子健等人2010年发表的论文《2004-2009年中国不明原因肺炎病例报告情况分析》则分析，因为监测针对性太强，各级地方政府担心经济和社会稳定等问题，而对不明原因肺炎病例的监测、报告过度关注，有形、无形地给卫生行政部门、疾控机构、医疗机构以及临床医务人员带来压力。
The analysis of the report of unspecified pneumonia cases in China 2004-2009, published by Nijuan, Feng Zijian and others in 2010, shows that the monitoring is too targeted, local governments at all levels worry about economic and social stability, over-monitoring and reporting of unknown pneumonia cases, putting pressure on health administration, disease control institutions, medical institutions and clinical staff.
1月20日，新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎被正式纳入法定传染病乙类管理，采取甲类传染病的预防、控制措施，将新型肺炎疫情的防控应对提至最高级别。
On January 20, pneumonia infected with the new coronavirus was formally placed under the management of Class B of the legally prescribed coronavirus.
1月24日，新冠肺炎的网络直报功能正式上线。
January 24, the new crown pneumonia online direct newspaper function officially went online.
各地医院可以在网络直报系统中上报新冠肺炎病例信息。
Hospitals around the world can report new cases of pneumonia in the online direct reporting system.
2月27日，国家卫健委高级别专家组组长钟南山在广州举行的新闻通气会上指出，“这次暴露的短板，我们CDC的地位太低了，只是个技术部门，CDC的特殊地位并没有得到足够重视”。
On February 27, Zhong Nan-shan, leader of the high-level group of experts of the National Fitness and Health Commission, told a news briefing in Guangzhou that the CDC's special status had not been given enough attention because of its low standing as a technical department.
自新冠肺炎疫情后，国家先后发布六版疫情防控方案，在3月7日发布最新的第六版《新型冠状病毒肺炎防控方案》中规定，各级各类医疗卫生机构发现疑似病例、确诊病例、无症状感染者时，应当于两小时内进行网络直报。
Since the outbreak of pneumonia in the New Coronavirus, the state has issued six versions of the epidemic prevention and control regime.In the latest version of the programme for the prevention and control of coronavirus pneumonia, on March 7, all types of medical and health institutions at all levels should report suspected cases, confirmed cases and asymptomatic infection within two hours.
与此方案适配的是，修改后的传染病报告卡上，患者类型和临床严重程度在系统中都有详细的分类可供选择。
In line with this approach, the modified infectious disease report card provides a detailed breakdown of patient types and clinical severity in the system.
一直以来，传染病的防治强调的都是早期介入，如果能更早监测病例，“当然是能更早遏制”，上述中疾控领导表示，“我想将来我们一定都会回过头来去看，去仔细考察，做一些包括技术上的、深入的调查和回顾。
The prevention and treatment of infectious diseases has always emphasized early intervention, and if cases can be detected earlier, "of course sooner," said the CDC leader. "I think we'll all go back in time, go over it, and do some technical, in-depth research and review.
