“给做尸检的专家团队一些时间，让他们潜心检查、研究，不要过分打扰他们”华中科技大学同济医学院法医学系教授刘良就新冠肺炎患者尸检接受央视采访图片来源：央视截屏备受瞩目的首份新冠病毒肺炎逝者遗体解剖报告出炉，2月25日的《法医学杂志》发表了《新型冠状病毒肺炎死亡尸体系统解剖大体观察报告》（下文简称《报告》），华中科技大学同济医学院法医学系教授刘良为通讯作者之一。
Liu Liang, professor of forensic medicine at the Tongji School of Medicine, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, gave an interview to CCTV on the autopsy of the coronavirus pneumonia.
这份报告是刘良团队解剖的其中1例遗体的肉眼观察结果。
The report is the unaided eye observation of one of Liu Liang's autopsies.
自2月16日凌晨完成全国首例新冠病毒肺炎患者遗体解剖，在法律政策允许并征得患者家属同意后，刘良团队共完成了9例遗体解剖。
Since the completion of the nation's first autopsy of patients with Newcastle virus pneumonia in the early hours of February 16, Liu's team has completed nine autopsies after legal policy allowed and with the consent of the patient's family.
此外，中科院院士、病理学专家卞修武与上海瑞金医院团队也已完成2例新冠肺炎遗体解剖。
In addition, Bian Xiuwu, a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and a pathologist, and the team from Shanghai Ruijin Hospital have also completed two autopsies.
多位临床病理学专家表示，新冠肺炎的发展过程、发病机制还不清晰，在“大体观察”之后，还需要显微镜观察、分子检测观察与研究，以完善对疾病的认知，指导诊断治疗和疫情防控。
A number of clinical pathologists said the progression and pathogenesis of new crown pneumonia is not clear, after "general observation," microscopic observation, molecular observation and research are needed to improve understanding of the disease, guide diagnosis and treatment, and prevent and control the disease.
“现在要继续加紧完成手头的工作。
"It is time to continue to press on with the work at hand.
时间有限，拜托请各位别打扰。
Time is limited, please don't disturb.
”刘良28日下午5时许写道。
"Liu Liang wrote about 5 p.m. on the 28th.
损伤深部气道和肺泡《报告》中这位85岁的男性患者于2020年1月以“多发性脑梗死”入院，住院后28天死亡，临床死亡原因诊断为“新型冠状病毒肺炎、呼吸衰竭”。
Injury to the deep airway and alveoli The 85-year-old man was admitted to hospital in January 2020 with a "multiple cerebral infarction" and died 28 days later. The cause of death was diagnosed as "new coronavirus pneumonia, respiratory failure."
2月17日下午，国家卫健委高级别专家组组长、中国工程院院士钟南山在广州与支援武汉的广东医疗队连线远程会诊，提及“新冠肺炎重症救治的主要困难在于病情有着不同的发展规律，随着危重症的发展，病毒会持续损伤肺部，包括对肺实质的损伤、肺的分泌粘液阻碍气道通畅等。
In the afternoon of February 17, Zhong Nan Shan, a senior expert group leader of the National Fitness and Health Commission and a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, connected a remote consultation in Guangzhou with the Guangdong Medical Team supporting Wuhan.
”2月24日一早，钟南山给刘良打电话，说前线医生就等他的尸检结果了，否则不知道治疗到底怎么办、治疗效果怎么评估。
Early in the morning of February 24, Zhong Nan Shan called Liu Liang, saying the front-line doctors were waiting for the results of his autopsy.
“我着急，赶快抓紧时间，（当时）其实已经开始有初步结果了。
I was in a hurry, hurry up, for the first results had already begun.
”刘良在接受央视新闻采访时表示。
"Liu Liang in the CCTV news interview said.
从解剖结果来看，该例患者肺部损伤明显，肺肉眼观呈斑片状，可见灰白色病灶及暗红色出血，切面可见大量黏稠的分泌物从肺泡内溢出。
From the results of the autopsy, the patient had obvious lung injury, and the unaided eye was patchy, with grayish-white lesion and dark red hemorrhage.
尸体检验肉眼所见与影像学改变分布情况相符合，且病变进一步进展。
The unaided eye examination of the cadaver was consistent with the distribution of imaging changes, and the lesion progressed further.
考虑影像学所见磨玻璃状影与肉眼所见肺泡灰白色病灶对应，提示新冠病毒主要引起深部气道和肺泡损伤为特征的炎性反应。
Considering the imaging findings, the abrasive glassy shadow corresponds to the alveolar gray-white lesions seen by the naked eye, suggesting that the new crown virus mainly causes inflammatory reactions characterized by deep airway and alveolar damage.
与此同时，一个网上流传很广的消息称，“病患遗体解剖发现死亡者肺部出现大量痰栓，痰栓是由呼吸机使用所产生的，痰栓最终致人缺氧而死。
Meanwhile, a widely circulated online source said: "Anatomy of the patient's body revealed a large number of phlegm bolts in the lungs of the deceased, which were produced by the use of a ventilator and resulted in hypoxia.
”并表示新冠感染死亡人数下降是因为刘良的尸检结果改变了临床治疗方法，“急救改用吸痰机”。
He said the death toll from the new crown infection had fallen because Liu's autopsy results had changed the clinical treatment, "First aid with a spittoon."
对此，刘良马上在个人媒体平台发表“严正声明”辟谣。
In this regard, Liu Liangma on the personal media platform issued a "solemn declaration" refutation.
“我不知道信息来源，也不知道谁发的。
"I don't know the source, I don't know who sent it.
我没有干预任何个例的临床治疗，每个病例都有他的不同特点，功劳是广大一线医护人员的，我不敢也不想贪天功。
I did not intervene in any individual clinical treatment, each case has his different characteristics, thanks to the vast number of front-line medical personnel, I dare not and do not want to credit.
”刘良写道。
"he wrote.
“对没有咳嗽能力的患者来说，气管插管更有利于把痰引流出来。
"For people who do not have the ability to cough, trachea intubation is better for pumping out phlegm.
” 苏北人民医院重症医学科主任郑瑞强对《中国新闻周刊》说，他从2020年除夕夜前就开始在武汉市肺科医院对口支援，这是最早开始收治新冠病毒肺炎患者的医院之一。
ZhengRuiqiang, director of severe medicine at the Subei People's Hospital, told China News Weekly that he had been providing desk-to-desk support at Wuhan's lung hospital since before New Year's Eve 2020, one of the first hospitals to start treating patients with Newcastle virus pneumonia.
他还表示，在《报告》发表之前，一线医生也已经发现了重症患者有痰液粘稠的临床表现，患者插管后，可采用俯卧的方式将痰液引流出体外，或插管后通过气管镜发现粘液在支气管上的具体位置，有针对性地将其吸出、清理干净。
Before the report was published, he said, first-line doctors had also found that patients with severe illnesses had mucous phlegm. After intubation, they could use a prone position to drain phlegm out of the body, or a tracheoscope could be used to locate mucus in the bronchus.
“《报告》观察到的弥漫性肺泡损伤、透明膜形成等与临床上呼吸窘迫综合征（ARDS）病人中晚期的治疗难点类似。
"Diffuse alveolar injury and hyaluronic membrane formation observed in the Report are similar to those in the advanced stages of clinical respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
”郑瑞强说，临床治疗上可能要提前预警，早插管、早期积极使用气管镜、俯卧位等手段促进痰液引流。
"Zheng Ruiqiang said clinical treatment may require early warning, early intubation, early active use of tracheoscope, prone position and other means to promote sputum drainage.
“网传把呼吸机改换吸痰机，纯属胡说八道。
"Changing the ventilator to a spittoon over the internet is sheer nonsense.
”郑瑞强说，目前有诸多技术手段可以在使用呼吸机的同时吸痰，中途停用呼吸机必然会造成患者低氧，这并不是最科学的方法。
Zheng Ruiqiang said there were a number of techniques that could be used to suck phlegm while breathing machines were in use.
《报告》还显示，死者胸腔积液量不多，淡黄色清亮液体，未见大量胸水产生，提示胸腔病变并非浆液性炎症为主。
The report also showed that the deceased had a low pleural effusion, a light yellowish fluid and no significant pleural effusion, suggesting that the pleural lesions were not primarily serous inflammation.
此外，《报告》中的患者肝、肾功能指标未见明显异常，消化系统损伤情况肉眼观不明显。
In addition, there were no significant abnormalities in liver and kidney function in the report, and no obvious damage to digestive system.
因患者临床资料显示存在冠心病、心绞痛病史，心肌及心外膜是否存在与病毒感染相关的损害表现，还有待进一步研究。
It remains to be further studied whether there is a history of coronary heart disease, angina pectoris, myocardium and epicardium associated with viral infection.
“有些是患者本身基础病导致的病理改变，可能定新冠病毒关系不大，《报告》中没有描述显微镜下的发现，此时要耐心等待后续病理结果，不宜过分解读。
"The report does not describe microscopic findings, which may have little to do with pathological changes caused by the patient's own underlying disease, and it is not appropriate to interpret them too much while waiting for the subsequent pathologic findings.
” 美国芝加哥大学医学院教授、武汉大学病理中心主任肖书渊对《中国新闻周刊》解释说，病理结果还有赖于医生个人专业知识与经验积累，“没有亲自看到标本的任何人仅凭文字都无法给出客观的判断。
Xiao Shuyuan, a professor at the University of Chicago School of Medicine and director of Wuhan University's pathology centre, explained that the pathology results also depended on the accumulation of doctors' personal expertise and experience.
”肖书渊说。
"said Xiao Shuyuan.
有关新冠肺炎后期病情进展迅速、心脏受损严重，病理学专家、南方医科大学病理学教授丁彦青在与卞修武讨论后推测“可能是细胞因子风暴引起的”。
After discussing with Bian Xiuwu, a pathologist and professor of pathology at Southern Medical University, Ding Yanqing speculated that "cytokine storms may have caused it."
2003年，丁彦青首次在英国《病理学杂志》上提出“肺和免疫器官是SARS病毒攻击的主要靶器官”，2006年再发表“SARS发病免疫病理机制研究”，提出“促炎症因子”过度表达与SARS急性肺损伤及全身多器官的损害密切相关，也就是现在所说的“细胞因子风暴”。
In 2003, Ding first suggested in the British Journal of Pathology that "lung and immune organs are the main target organs for SARS virus attacks." In 2006, he published a study on the immunopathological mechanism of SARS.
丁彦青说，与SARS起病凶猛不同，这次新冠病毒肺炎潜伏期长，早期病症轻，需要选择不同病情的病例，例如治疗一段时间后突然病情加重而死亡的案例，可能会更全面地反映疫情整体情况。
Ding said that unlike SARS, which had a long incubation period and a low incidence of early illness, cases requiring different conditions, such as sudden and severe death after a period of treatment, might provide a more comprehensive picture of the epidemic as a whole.
另一篇由新冠死者尸体穿刺取样获得的组织局部病理学改变提示，新冠患者病理特征与SARS和MERS（中东呼吸综合征）冠状病毒引起的病理特征非常类似，但从刘良团队系统解剖的大体观察来看，患者肺部纤维化及实变没有SARS导致的病变严重，而渗出性反应较SARS 明显，考虑可能与此例患者从确诊到死亡仅15天，病程较短有关，有待更多系统尸体检验资料及组织病理学验证。
Another local histopathological change from a coronavirus from a coronavirus collected from a coronavirus in a newly-crowned patient showed a very similar pathologic profile to that of the coronavirus caused by SARS and MERS. However, based on the systematic anatomy of Liu Liang's team, pulmonary fibrosis and consolidation were less severe than SARS.
“两篇病理结果并不矛盾。
"The two pathologic findings are not contradictory.
”郑瑞强解释说，不同患者的病理表现会因病程不同、治疗方法不同而存在差异。
The pathology of different patients varies according to the course of the disease and the treatment method, Zheng explained.
“病人生前的干预治疗是怎么样的，治疗措施对病理表现的影响是什么，这对临床的指导将更有针对性。
"What is the interventional treatment of the patient in life, and what is the effect of the treatment on pathologic performance? This will be more targeted for clinical guidance."
”郑瑞强解释说，一方面可以在重症病人治疗上更有效地阻断病程进展，另一方面，了解肺损伤是由病毒攻击所致，还是治疗技法带来的，将不同病理表现与具体治疗技法、参数结合，可指导临床上给患者机械通气的同时更好地实施肺部保护，而这还需要进一步病理分析的支持。
"While blocking progression more effectively in the treatment of severe patients, understanding whether lung injury is caused by viral attack or by therapeutic techniques, combining different pathologic features with specific treatment techniques and parameters can guide patients towards mechanical ventilation and better lung protection, which requires further pathological analysis," Zheng explained.
“给做尸检的专家团队一些时间，让他们潜心检查、研究，不要过分打扰他们。
"Give the team of experts who perform the autopsy some time and allow them to focus on their studies and research without bothering them too much.
”肖书渊在采访过程中一再强调。
Xiao Shuyuan stressed repeatedly during the interview.
首份新冠肺炎遗体解剖报告已发表 图片来源：法医学杂志病理诊断是“金标准”早在春节前后，中国病理学界专家就开始在微信朋友圈呼吁“做病例尸检”。
2007-9-25 21: 48 The First Anatomy Report on New Crown Pneumonia The first autopsy report has been published in the Journal of Forensic Medicine. Early in the Spring Festival period, Chinese pathologists began calling for a "case autopsy" in a circle of microscopic friends.
1月29日，中国科学院院士卞修武就向中国疾病预防控制中心发出了《关于开展新型冠状病毒感染死亡病例尸检工作的建议》（下文简称《建议》），当天国家卫健委通报全国确诊病例7711例，累计死亡170例。
On January 29, Chinese Academy of Sciences academician Bian Xiuwu issued recommendations to the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how to carry out autopsy of death cases of coronavirus infection (hereinafter referred to as "the recommendations").
病理诊断被称作疾病诊断的“金标准”，对病因的研究有助于临床上有的放矢地治疗。
Pathological diagnosis is called the "gold standard" of disease diagnosis, and the study of etiology is helpful for targeted clinical treatment.
2003年SARS爆发后，病原体最初被认为是破坏力并不大的“衣原体”，但患者病情重、死亡率高，应用抗生素无效。
After the SARS outbreak in 2003, the pathogen was initially thought to be the less destructive chlamydia, but the patient was seriously ill, had a high mortality rate, and was ineffective with antibiotics.
丁彦青完成首例SARS死者解剖后，结合当时在南方医院进行的4例尸检结果，综合判断病原体应为“病毒”，这为非典治疗提供了重要科学依据。
After completing the first autopsy of SARS victim, Ding combined with the results of 4 autopsy cases in Southern Hospital at that time, comprehensively judged that the pathogen should be "virus," which provided important scientific basis for SARS treatment.
此次新冠疫情中，早在1月26日，中国疾控中心病毒病预防控制所所长许文波就在工作介绍会上表示，该中心已成功分离病毒。
As early as January 26, Xu Wenbo, director of the China CDC Virus Prevention and Control Institute, told a briefing at the briefing that the center had successfully isolated the virus.
“但是，这一新发传染病的发病机制、病理特征及其相关临床病理联系目前尚处于未知状态。
"However, the pathogenesis, pathologic features and clinicopathological association of this new infectious disease are still unknown.
这对于进一步改进诊疗方案，提高救治水平，防控今后可能的类似疾病，十分不利。
This will further improve the diagnosis and treatment plan, improve the level of treatment, prevention and control of possible similar diseases in the future, very adverse.
”卞修武在《建议》中写道。
Bian Xiuwu wrote in the Recommendations.
2月14日，刘良也在个人媒体平台上“呼吁尽快开展新冠肺炎死亡个体尸体检验”。
On Feb. 14, Liu Liang also on the personal media platform "call for a new crown pneumonia death as soon as possible individual body examination."
当时全国确诊数已达到63946例，1382人死亡，但还没有对死亡个体开展系统性实体解剖及病理学检验。
By then, the number of confirmed cases nationwide had reached 63,946, resulting in 1,382 deaths, but no systematic physical autopsy or pathologic examination had been carried out on individuals who had died.
为什么上呼吸道病毒检测阳性远低于下呼吸道？患者肺部“磨玻璃样”病理学改变与其他的病毒性肺炎有何异同？后期病情进展迅速的原因和机制是什么？新冠病毒肺炎在临床治疗过程中有许多问题还未得到科学解释。
Why is the upper respiratory virus positive much lower than the lower respiratory tract? What are the similarities and differences between the pathologic changes "ground glass-like" changes in the lungs and other viral pneumonia? What are the causes and mechanisms of the rapid progression of the disease in the latter stages?
第二天上午11点，刘良收到了国家卫生健康委员会医政医管局回复，获邀参加新冠肺炎病死病例尸检相关事宜会议，他本来“乐观估计尸检落地还需要2～3天”。
The next morning at 11: 00 am, Liu Liang received a reply from the National Health Council's Medical Administration and was invited to attend an autopsy-related meeting on the death of Newcomb Pneumonia. He was "optimistic that the autopsy will take another two to three days."
通知比预想来得更早。
The notification came earlier than expected.
2月15日晚9点，正在等待回复的刘良突然接到武汉市金银潭医院院长张定宇的电话，“有一个可以做解剖的了。
On February 15, at 9: 00 pm, Liu Liang, who was waiting for a reply, suddenly received a telephone call from Zhang Dingyu, director of the gold and silver pool hospital in Wuhan.
”事后刘良回忆道，“国家、省市卫健委打破常规，先行动，然后下正式文”。
"After Liu Liang recalled," the state, provincial and municipal health committees break the routine, first action, then under the official text. "
刘良紧急安排团队人员从武汉市各个角落汇集到医院。
Liu Liang emergency arrangements team members from all corners of Wuhan to the hospital.
与此同时，金银潭医院专门腾出了一间负压洁净手术室，确保解剖的同时不让病毒扩散。
At the same time, the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital has set aside a negative pressure to clean the operating room to ensure anatomy while keeping the virus from spreading.
穿着令人呼吸困难的防护服等到凌晨1点多，刘良团队开始尸检，3点50分，首例尸检工作顺利结束。
Dressed in breathless protective clothing until more than 1 a.m., Liu's team began an autopsy, 3: 50 pm, the first autopsy successfully concluded.
16日上午11时许，刘良再次接到金银潭医院院长张定宇通知，“又有一例需要尸检。
At about 11: 00 a.m. on the 16th, Liu Liang received another notification from Zhang Dingyu, director of the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital.
”急招队员，再次赶赴医院，当天下午4点开始解剖，6点半结束时，“浑身湿透”的刘良倍感寒冷，马上回家再次自我隔离，并记录下连续工作18小时的经过。
"The group rushed to the hospital again, where the autopsy began at 4 p.m., and at 6: 30 a.m. Liu Liang, who was" wet through, "felt cold and went home again, recording 18 hours of continuous work.
“终于知道隔离防护服的厉害了。
"Finally I know that the protective clothing is strong.
穿上不到10分钟，满头大汗，结果在干平时轻松可以干的活时，汗如雨下，呼吸困难，眼镜护目镜朦胧一片。
Wear less than 10 minutes, sweaty head, the result in the usual easy to do work, sweat, breathing difficulties, glasses hazy one.
像高原反应一样，第一例做到大半截，出现心慌头晕低血糖表现。
Like the plateau reaction, the first case achieved a large part of the dizziness, dizziness and hypoglycemia.
一方面说明自己确实老了。
On the one hand, he is really old.
但真的体会到医护人员的艰辛和付出。
But I really appreciate the hardship and dedication of the medical staff.
必须要向所有普普通通的一线医护战士致敬！”刘良回忆道。
We must pay homage to all the ordinary frontline medical fighters, "Liu recalled.
在第一、二例遗体解剖完成的同时，卞修武及其团队也在中部战区医院搭建了符合生物安全保护Ⅲ级（BSL-3）标准的“帐篷式”尸体解剖室，开展新型冠肺炎尸体解剖工作。
While the first and second autopsies were completed, Bian and his team set up a "tent-style" autopsy room at the Central War Hospital that met the BSL-3 standard to perform a new autopsy of coronary pneumonia.
目前11例捐赠遗体中，年龄偏大，多超过60岁，也有80多岁高龄的捐赠者，最小一例为52岁。
Of the 11 donated bodies, most were older than 60 years old, and there were also donors in their 80s, the youngest being 52.
据刘良介绍，他们与华中科技大学同济医学院病理系主任王国平合作，有3例病理诊断的初步结果已经出来了，如免疫组化、特殊染色等更深入的检查正在抓紧做。
In cooperation with Wang Guoping, chairman of the Department of Pathology at Tongji Medical School of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, the preliminary results of three pathologic diagnoses have been presented.
“国内临床病理很少开展尸检，医院病理科没有基本解剖的条件。
"Internal clinical pathology rarely carried out autopsy, the hospital pathology department has no basic anatomy conditions.
”肖书渊解释说，缺少符合标准的尸体解剖实验室确实是尸检直到2月中旬才开展的一个客观原因，新冠又是一种传染力很强的疾病，进行尸检需要向上汇报、再通过审批，这个过程需要时间，肖书渊提出，可以采用“微创病理检查”。
Xiao explained that the lack of a standard autopsy laboratory was indeed an objective reason why the autopsy did not take place until mid-February and that the new crown was a highly contagious disease requiring upward reporting and subsequent approval, a process that would take time for Xiao to initiate and use a "minimally invasive pathology examination."
实际上，首份新冠遗体穿刺样本病理报告已于2月18日在《柳叶刀-呼吸医学杂志》线上发表，该报告由解放军总医院第五医学中心病理诊断与研究中心主任赵景民团队和中国科学院院士、第五医学中心感染性疾病诊疗与研究中心王福生团队联合完成。
In fact, the first pathology report of the new crown body was published online on February 18 in the Lancet-Respiratory Medicine Journal. The report was carried out jointly by the team of Zhao Jingmin, director of the Centre for Pathological Diagnosis and Research of the 5th Medical Center of the PLA General Hospital, and the team of Wang Fusheng, Academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
“该患者27日死亡，在取得家属同意和相关手续后，我们做了穿刺，病理结果第一时间报告给了疫情防控部门，随后才发表在期刊上。
"The patient died on the 27th. After obtaining the family's consent and the relevant procedures, we had a puncture and the pathological results were first reported to the disease control authorities before being published in the Journal.
”赵景民介绍说，考虑到没有符合尸体解剖的客观条件，团队选择了微创穿刺取样，对死者遗体损伤小，不会造成环境污染，而且传染风险小，保护操作者的安全。
"Considering the lack of objective conditions for an autopsy, the team opted for minimally invasive sampling, with minimal damage to the body, no environmental pollution and a low risk of infection to protect the operator, Zhao said.
尸体解剖实验室的缺位2003年首例SARS尸体解剖时，这一传染病的名字还没确定，还被称为“不明原因的肺炎”，当时丁彦青团队基本没有防护，只带了普通口罩，现在想来仍觉“不可思议”。
When the autopsy of the first SARS autopsy in 2003 was missing, the name of the infection had not yet been decided, and Ding's team, largely unprotected but wearing a common mask, still felt "unthinkable."
这一特殊时机下的非常举措为了解SARS的病理变化和发病机制做出了贡献，但缺乏生物安全保证，不可推广复制。
This extraordinary initiative at this particular time has contributed to an understanding of the pathologic changes and pathogenesis of SARS, but it lacks biosecurity assurances and cannot be replicated.
到2003年5月，北京大学医学部病理学系教授宫恩聪等人与解放军防化研究院专家共同在北京地坛医院内建立了BSL-3尸体解剖实验室。
By May 2003, Miao En-chong, a professor in the Department of Pathology at Peking University, and experts from the PLA Institute of Chemical Sciences had set up a BSL-3 autopsy laboratory at Beijing Ditan Hospital.
地坛医院原名“北京第一传染病医院”，官网介绍，医院主要承担除结核病以外的38种法定传染病的诊治、研究和培训任务。
The hospital, formerly known as the Beijing No.1 Infectious Disease Hospital, has been tasked with the diagnosis, treatment, research and training of 38 statutory infectious diseases, with the exception of tuberculosis.
地坛医院的BSL3实验室分为污染区、缓冲区1、半污染区、缓冲区2和清洁区，各区之间由空气密闭式门衔接。
The BSL3 laboratory at Ditan Hospital is divided into contaminated areas, buffer zone 1, semi-polluted area, buffer zone 2 and clean area.
资料显示，污染区内中央为尸体解剖台，新风自解剖台上方排下, 外排风在周围墙根部抽出,在解剖人员和遗体之间形成气幕隔离。
According to the data, the center of the contaminated area is the autopsy table. The fresh air comes from the anatomy table, the outer exhaust air is pumped from the surrounding wall, and an air curtain is formed between the anatomist and the body.
“尸体解剖室的技术要求较高，这主要是为了避免对外部环境造成污染，关键是污血、污水处理，以及空气处理。
"The autopsy room is technically demanding, mainly to avoid contamination of the external environment, the key being sewage, sewage treatment and air treatment.
”解放军总院第五医学中心病理诊断与研究中心主任赵景民对《中国新闻周刊》说，他曾于2003年3月8日参与北京地区首例SARS死亡病例的尸体解剖。
Zhao Jingmin, director of the Centre for Pathological Diagnosis and Research at the Fifth Medical Center of the PLA General Hospital, told China News Weekly that he had participated in the autopsy of the first case of SARS in Beijing on March 8, 2003.
地坛医院BSL3实验室对医护人员个体防护和要求还有一套规范。
The BSL3 laboratory of Ditan Hospital has a set of standards for individual protection and requirements of medical staff.
要求进入污染区的工作人员必须内穿消毒衣、裤，外层穿军用无渗漏防化服和防毒面具，戴三层橡皮手套，最外层手套用不干胶带封闭。
Workers who enter the contaminated area are required to wear sterile clothing, trousers, a military-free chemical suit and gas mask, three rubber gloves, and a adhesive tape for the outermost gloves.
该实验室还对工作人员解剖完毕时、进入半污染区、进入缓冲区2等环节的具体动作做出了明确要求。
The laboratory also made clear requirements for the staff when the autopsy was completed, into the semi-polluted area, into the buffer zone 2, and other specific actions.
该实验室共完成了15例临床疑似SARS和SARS死亡病例的病理解剖工作, 其中7例为病理确定诊断的SARS 死亡病例。
The laboratory completed 15 pathological autopsies of clinically suspected SARS and SARS deaths, 7 of which were confirmed pathologically as SARS deaths.
参加SARS 死亡病例的病理解剖的工作人员共23人, 2003年5月到7月连续工作2个月余, 无1人发生交叉感染。
A total of 23 staff members took part in the pathologic autopsy of the SARS deaths, and no one was cross-infected for more than two months between May and July 2003.
“不是防护服穿得越多越安全，正规防护即可。
"The more protective clothing you wear, the safer it is.
”肖书渊介绍说，在常规负压手术室操作，一副手套就够，3层手套则会限制操作。
Xiao said a pair of gloves would be enough to operate in a conventional negative-pressure operating room, while three-storey gloves would restrict operation.
这得益于美国医院采取的全面防护设计，污水、污血、空气均经过规范处理，“医院病理尸检室对待任何尸体都会认为有潜在感染性，日常也会见到各种各样的传染病，不必因死者生前有某种传染病而单独拿出来特殊对待。
Because of the comprehensive protective design adopted by American hospitals, sewage, blood and air are standardized. "Any body treated by the hospital pathology department will be considered potentially infectious, and every day there will be a variety of infectious diseases that do not need to be singled out for special treatment because the deceased had an infectious disease."
”肖书渊说。
"said Xiao Shuyuan.
根据北京市确定的2005年重点建设项目，曾收治过非典病人的北京地坛医院于2008年整体搬迁到了京郊。
In 2008, the Beijing Ditan Hospital, which had treated SARS patients, moved to the outskirts of Beijing in 2008, according to a key construction project set by Beijing.
BSL3实验室拆除后并未在新院址复建，这得到了地坛医院病理科主任王鹏的确认。
The BSL3 laboratory was dismantled and not reconstructed at the new site, which was confirmed by Wang Peng, Director of Pathology, Ditan Hospital.
2009年6月，公安部发布了《尸体解剖检验室建设规范(GA/T 830-2009)》，该标准适用于法医学时间解剖检验室的建设。
In June 2009, the Ministry of Public Security issued the Regulation on the Construction of Autopsy Laboratory (GA / T 830-2009), which is applicable to the construction of forensic anatomical laboratories.
“大家熟知的生物实验室有建设标准，但临床尸体解剖实验室目前还没有国家标准，就无法挂牌、开展工作，需要政策扶持。
"Well-known biological laboratories have construction standards, but clinical autopsy laboratories do not currently have national standards, can not be listed, work, need policy support.
”赵景民说。
"said Zhao.
与尸检实验室缺失相对应的是，国内尸检率的下降。
Corresponding to the absence of an autopsy laboratory, the rate of autopsy in the country has declined.
尸体解剖的普遍程度，在一定意义上反映了一个国家的科技与医疗发展水平。
The prevalence of autopsy in a certain sense reflects a country's level of scientific and medical development.
但从1990年代到21世纪初的近20年，“中国大多数的大型( 1500床位以上)教学医院的常规尸检率不足1%，许多医院己多年未进行过尸检。
But in the nearly two decades from the 1990 "s to the early 2000" s, "the majority of large (1,500-bed) teaching hospitals in China have less than a percent routine autopsy rate, and many have not had an autopsy for years."
”著名病理学专家、原长海医院病理科主任朱明华在《我国病理尸检的过去和现状》中写道。
Zhu Minghua, a renowned pathologist and former director of pathology at Changhai Hospital, wrote in The Past and Present Situation of Pathological Autopsy in China.
朱明华将尸检率下降的原因归结为医院行政领导和卫生行政管理机构不重视、临床医生不愿争取尸检、相关法规执行不到位等因素。
Zhu attributed the decline in the autopsy rate to factors such as the neglect of hospital administrators and health authorities, clinicians' reluctance to seek autopsies and inadequate enforcement of relevant regulations.
原卫生部曾在颁发的“医院分级评等标准”中规定,三级甲等医院尸检率应达到15%,二级医院应达到10%。
The former Ministry of Health issued "Hospital grading standards," which stipulated that post-mortem examinations should reach 15 per cent in level III hospitals and 10 per cent in level II hospitals.
然而各级医院尸检率远未达标，《首都医药》杂志曾在2007年第一期刊文《医院“尸检率”集体滑坡——部分二级医院甚至出现“零尸检”》。
However, autopsy rates are far from meeting standards at all levels, with Capital Medical magazine reporting in its first issue of 2007 that there had been a collective decline in "autopsy rates" - even "zero autopsies" in some level-II hospitals.
“法规的制定固然重要,但认真执行则更重要。
"Legislation is important, but its implementation is even more important.
”朱明华写道。

“我国缺少针对甲类传染病的解剖室，这个问题现在已经很紧迫了，新冠病毒之后还将面临什么，我们不知道，但要做好准备，”丁彦青呼吁，“至少一个省要有一间生物安全保护Ⅲ级(BSL -3)尸体解剖实验室。
"The lack of anatomy rooms for A-type infectious diseases in our country is a pressing issue now, we don't know what the future of the new crown virus will be, but be prepared," Ding called. "At least one province needs a BSL-3 autopsy laboratory.
