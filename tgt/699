截止到这期节目播出的 2020 年 2 月 7 日，全国已经有 31211 人确诊染上了「新冠肺炎」。
By February 7, 2020, when the program was broadcast, 31,211 people across the country had been diagnosed with pneumonia.
今天的讲述者木头就是这三万多人当中的一位。
Today's narrator, Wood, is one of more than 30,000 people.
木头也是 故事FM 的听众，自他确诊之后，每天都用手机录下一段声音日记，记录自己患病和隔离的感受。
Wood is also an FM listener who has recorded his illness and isolation daily on his cell phone since his diagnosis.
今天，我们就把这些声音日记播放给你听。
Today, we'll show you these audio diaries.
1月 30 日，大年初六，隔离第 1 天我叫木头，今年 31 岁，来自武汉。
January 30th, about the sixth day of the year, isolation The first day of my name is wood, this year is 31 years old, from Wuhan.
今年春节，我们准备带上岳父岳母，回太太的老家重庆一个小县城过年。
This Spring Festival, we are ready to take his wife's father-in-law mother, back to his wife's hometown of Chongqing, a small county.
1 月 16 日，岳父他们来武汉和我们汇合，22 日，我们从武汉自驾回到重庆。
On January 16, their father-in-law came to Wuhan to join us. On January 22, we drove back to Chongqing from Wuhan.
出发前一天，我岳父可能晚上着凉了，出现了风寒性的感冒，在车上开始咳嗽，但没有其他症状。
The day before we set out, my father-in-law might have had a cold at night, caught a cold and started coughing in the car, but had no other symptoms.
回重庆后，武汉封城，我们知道事态有点严重了，出门买菜都开始戴口罩。
Back in Chongqing, Wuhan closed the city, we know things are a bit serious, out to buy vegetables began to wear masks.
大年初二、初三的样子，有人举报我的鄂 A 车牌，社区打电话来核查，我们也积极配合，透露了一些个人信息。
New Year's Day, the appearance of the third day, someone reported my E E license plate, the community called to verify, we also actively cooperate, revealed some personal information.
■一辆鄂 A 牌照的汽车，和三只警惕的猫图/视觉中国我太太是昨天（1 月 29 日）开始发热的，岳父正好要来医院复查，我们就让他先去，如果他检测出来有问题，那我们全家都要入院观察，如果他没有问题，我们就打算继续在家隔离。
Our wife started to get hot yesterday (January 29), just as my father-in-law was coming to the hospital for a check-up, so we sent him first. If he detected any problems, the whole family would have to be hospitalized.
下午 3 点多，医院告诉我们，CT 的结果显示肺部感染，让我们尽快去检查。
By 3: 00 p. m., the hospital told us that CT results showed a lung infection. Let's have an examination as soon as possible.
接着，我太太又被确诊，当场就被收进医院了。
Then my wife was diagnosed and admitted to the hospital on the spot.
我和我丈母娘则继续在家隔离。
My mother-in-law and I remained isolated at home.
今天上午，我又接到了我媳妇的电话，她说怀疑我也有感染，让我尽快赶来。
This morning, I received another phone call from my daughter-in-law. She said she suspected I had an infection.
为了不再引发恐慌，我自己打了一辆摩托车来的医院。
In order not to cause panic, I took a motorcycle myself to the hospital.
医院分两层，一楼是门诊，问了我一些个人信息，然后把我从武汉回来以后的移动路线做了一张表，我就上二楼的隔离病房了。
The hospital is divided into two levels, the first floor is out-patient, asked me some personal information, and then back from Wuhan after I made a table, I went to the second floor of the isolation ward.
全国的医疗资源都很紧张，我能理解，但也让我非常担忧。
I understand the strain on health resources across the country, but I am also very worried.
我岳父第一次来医院检查的时候，他的肺部就检查出来有阴影，但这边说，「不要紧。
When my father-in-law first came to the hospital for an examination, his lungs were shaded, but this side said, "Never mind."
」如果当时就能做咽喉拭子，当时就能确诊，也许不会有后续这些问题。
"If he had been able to take a swabb off his throat, he would have been diagnosed and there would have been no follow-up.
■县医院的隔离病房这里的隔离措施也很不安全，每个病房都有通风口，病人可以随意站在走廊里抽烟、攀谈、串门，根本没有效果。
▪ Isolated wards of county hospitals, where isolation is also unsafe, with vents in every ward and patients allowed to stand in the corridors smoking, talking and visiting doors at will, to no avail.
我的病房有三张床和一个独立卫生间，但里面锈渍满满，看起来非常陈旧。
My ward had three beds and a separate bathroom, but it was rusty and looked very old.
我住进来以后抽了 3 次血，做了一个咽喉拭子，没有输液。
I smoked blood three times since I came in. I did a swabb on my throat. There was no infusion.
■县医院的病床听说我们明天要转院到市级的定点医院去，那边的情况也不容乐观，每天都有区县的病人往那儿送，病房也是多人间，会不会有交叉感染的可能性我也不知道。
■ The hospital beds in county hospitals are told that we will be transferred tomorrow to the designated hospitals at the municipal level, and the situation there is not optimistic, there are patients there every day, the ward is also a multi-room, I do not know whether there will be cross-infection possibility.
而且听说进去了以后还要收手机，相当于隔离外界所有联系。
And I heard that after entering the mobile phone, equivalent to the isolation of all external contacts.
我一听到这个消息，就立刻把我和太太即将到期的信用卡和房贷全部还完。
As soon as I heard the news, I paid my wife and I all the credit cards and mortgages that were due.
我不知道等我出来的时候，新的账单会不会逾期，会不会对我们的征信造成影响。
I do not know when I come out, the new bill will not be overdue, will not affect our credit information.
我现在还没有和我的父母讲，如果真的要离开手机，我就一定得和他们说了。
I haven't told my parents yet that if I really want to leave the phone, I must talk to them.
我只希望我太太能好一点，她太不容易了。
I just wish my wife would be better. She's too hard.
我现在和我丈母娘住在一间，我们都没有明显的症状，但确诊了。
I'm living in the same room with my mother-in-law, and we don't have obvious symptoms, but we're diagnosed.
她现在正遭受着电话和信息的双重轰炸，小县城是个熟人社会，所有人都知道我们被隔离了。
She was being bombarded by phone calls and messages, and the county was an acquaintance, and everyone knew that we were isolated.
所有人都在打电话问，她的话也说了一遍又一遍，还要一遍一遍安慰他们不要担心。
Everyone was on the phone asking, and her words were repeated over and over again, reassuring them not to worry.
这对她真的是一种折磨，就像一遍遍把刀扎进去，再抽出来，根本没有起到止血的作用。
It was really a torture for her, like stabbing a knife again and again and pulling it out, without stopping the bleeding at all.
2 月 1 日，隔离第 3 天，天气阴昨天晚上我们 7 点多坐着救护车到的这家新医院，路上用了两个半小时。
February 1st, Isolation Day 3. It was cloudy Last night we took an ambulance to the new hospital at 7: 00 p.m. It took us two and a half hours on the road.
■转院乘坐的救护车收手机是误传，但因为现在住的是 7 人间，晚上不太方便录音。
:: The ambulance transferred to the hospital received the mobile phone by mistake, but since it is now occupied by seven people, it is not convenient to record it at night.
这里床位也很紧张，有的病房人数更多。
Bed space here is also very tight, some wards are more crowded.
来了以后先做了一个检查，然后抽了 12 管血，做了一个雾化治疗，打了一针胸肽腺（编者注：增强免疫力）。
When he arrived, he had a check-up, 12 tubes of blood, an aerosol treatment, and a thymopeptide gland.
医院的设施和环境都有了质的提升，医护人员也都配有防护措施，但听他们说，这里的医疗物资也非常紧张。
Hospital facilities and environment have been qualitatively upgraded, and health care workers are equipped with protective measures, but listen to them, the medical supplies here are also very tight.
医护人员都很疲惫，来去匆匆。
The paramedics were tired and hurried.
这个病覆盖面太广了，每个人对它的认知和理解程度都不一样，他们除了治疗以外，还要面对患者的无理取闹，真的非常辛苦。
The coverage of the disease is too wide, everyone's knowledge and understanding of it is not the same, they have to deal with patients in addition to treatment, vexatious, really very hard.
■木头居住的病房这座医院可能是被划为「新冠」病毒治疗医院不久，很多设施还不太完善，一直有砸墙改造的声音，我也可以理解。
Ward of Wood Living Ward This hospital may have been classified as the New Crown Virus Treatment Hospital. Not long after, many facilities were not perfect.
饭菜口感还不错，每一餐都有水果和酸奶。
The food was good, with fruit and yogurt for every meal.
我太太和岳父两个人现在已经不发烧了。
My wife and my father-in-law are no longer feverish.
但现在爆发的已知病人这么多，治愈率还是不高，我不知道还要拖多久。
But with so many known cases now, the cure rate is still low, and I don't know how long it will take.
我太太的体质相对要弱一些，所以我比较担心她。
My wife is relatively weak, so I'm more worried about her.
住院的时候我带了一本专业书，虽然也看不进去，但好歹打发一点时间。
I took a professional book with me when I was hospitalized, and though I couldn't see it, I passed some time away.
另外，在这儿我第一次抽了动脉血，比静脉血疼得多。
In addition, for the first time here, I pumped arterial blood, which was much more painful than venous blood.
■12 管血2 月 2 日，隔离第 4 天，小雨转阴今天上午 8: 30 起床，装修声依旧不绝于耳，但睡得还行。
:: 12 Pipe Blood February 2, Isolation Day 4, the drizzle turned cloudy this morning at 8: 30 this morning, the decoration is still heard, but sleep well.
■医院提供的餐食，每餐有水果和酸奶没做任何检查，常规的药物治疗，吃的是抗艾滋病的药。
▪ Hospital-provided meals, with fruit and yoghurt for every meal without any check-up, regular medication, anti-AIDS drugs.
今天的饭菜有青椒炒腊肉、家常豆腐还有木耳炒肉，口味挺不错，但不知道是不是药物的原因，我一直没什么胃口。
Today's meal has green pepper fried bacon, home-cooked tofu and fungus scrambled meat, taste is very good, but I do not know whether the drug is the cause, I have no appetite.
这几天我一直在关注疫情的进展，但看久了发现，眼下最重要的是让自己快点好起来。
I've been following the epidemic for days, but I've seen for a long time that the most important thing is to get better soon.
出院人数只是数字而已，背后都是一个个像我一样的人，我只有让自己快点儿好起来，让痊愈的数字增加，才能给病友们信心。
The number of people discharged from hospital is just a number, behind the people like me, I can only let myself quickly better, so that the number of recovery, to give patients confidence.
我们住的隔离区是封闭的，有一个走道可以稍微活动一下，找一个没人的地方透透气。
The isolation area we live in is closed. There is a walkway where we can move a little bit and find a place where no one can breathe.
■隔离病区的走廊病友们基本都在刷视频类的 App，或者和家人打电话报平安。
▪ Corridor patients in isolated areas are basically in the brush video-like App, or with their families to call peace.
有几个大哥精神状态特别好，不厌其烦地把自己的遭遇一遍一遍地打电话和朋友讲，声音还特别大，根本不像得了任何疾病。
Several of the older brothers were in a particularly good state of mind, never tired of talking to their friends on the phone over and over again, and talking so loudly that they did not seem to be suffering from any disease at all.
我自己是根本不愿意和别人提起这件事，他们却特别乐观，真的佩服。
I do not want to mention this to others myself, but they are particularly optimistic, really admire.
要说最想念什么，也就是自由吧。
If you miss what you miss most, it's freedom.
2 月 3 日，隔离第 5 天，阴转晴今天的生活轨迹还是如常：吃药、测体温、做雾化、打针，又重新拍了 CT，但结果还不知道。
Feb. 3, Isolation Day 5, Yin turns fine Today's life remains the same: take the medicine, take the temperature, spray, inject, and retake the CT, but the results are not known.
■等待检查的人们被隔离了这么久，肯定会焦虑，但我对自己的身体有信心，出院不会遥遥无期。
▪ While people waiting to be screened are bound to be anxious after being isolated for so long, I am confident of my own health and will not be discharged indefinitely.
只是现在药物反应有点儿大，食欲和腹泻的影响比较明显。
It is only now that the drug reacts a little bit, appetite and diarrhea are more obvious.
我知道这次疫情爆发后，让很多人对这个社会有些失望，但我想还是要抱有一些积极想法。
I know that after the outbreak, many people have been disappointed in this society, but I think we should still have some positive ideas.
你想，那么多的医生和护士，「抛家弃子」为了你，冒着生命危险奉献着自己，说什么也不能让他们白白失望。
So many doctors and nurses, you think, "abandon your family and children," risking their lives to give themselves up for you, and say nothing to disappoint them.
我有同学就是医务工作者，真的像新闻里说的那样，在封城后，从老家「逆行」回到武汉，加入到救治的第一线。
I have a classmate is a medical worker, as the news said, after the closure of the city, from his hometown "retrograde" back to Wuhan, joined the front line of treatment.
这些事情就发生在你的身边，触动还是很大的。
These things happen right next to you, and they can be very touching.
2 月 4 日，隔离第 6 天，天气阴感染后，我身体情况一直很良好，没有出现「新冠」肺炎的病症。
On February 4, the sixth day of isolation, after the cloudy weather infection, I have been in good health and have not developed symptoms of "new crown" pneumonia.
但我们这层有些病友出现咳嗽和发烧的症状，不过都有好转。
But some of our patients have coughing and fever symptoms, but all are getting better.
这边人的心态真的挺好的，有些病友天天在外放声高歌，也带来很多欢乐。
This side of the mentality is really good, some of the sick friends out every day singing, but also brought a lot of joy.
这次隔离让我发现自己其实挺能适应环境的，即使它令你不爽或者难受，但你为了活下去，只能适应它。
This isolation makes me find that I can actually adapt to the environment, even if it makes you uncomfortable or uncomfortable, but you have to adapt to it in order to live.
如果出院回到武汉的话，我要先满足一下口腹之欲。
If I go back to Wuhan, I will satisfy my appetite first.
我想吃热干面、小龙虾、炸酱面、牛肉面、汤包、豆皮、火锅、烧烤……真的希望这次疫情早点儿过去。
I would like to eat hot dry noodles, crayfish, fried noodles, beef noodle, soups, peas, hotpot, barbecue... I really hope this epidemic will be over sooner.
■武汉户部巷小吃街图/视觉中国2 月 5 日，隔离第 7 天，天气雨到了新医院以后，我一直用的是抗艾滋病的药，网上也传说这种药对治疗有效果，但很冒险。
Wuhan Hou Department Lane Road Picture / SightChina February 5, Isolation Day 7, the weather and rain to the new hospital, I have been using anti-AIDS drugs, the Internet also legend that the medicine is effective for treatment, but very risky.
我服用这个药以来，晚上睡觉会浑身出汗，呼吸急促，鼻子不通畅。
Since taking this medicine, I have been sweating at night, breathing is short and my nose is not clear.
我在武汉的朋友也有感染的，但他们的治疗方法和重庆这边的不太一样。
My friends in Wuhan are infected, but their treatment methods are not the same as those in Chongqing.
我个人感觉还是偏向人体的自愈能力，所有的治疗手段都是先激活你的自愈能力，然后再用药物辅助。
I personally feel inclined to the body's ability to heal, and all treatments activate your ability to heal first, then use medication.
我现在感觉还可以，还是没有什么病症，就看过两天做鼻咽拭子的结果了。
I now feel OK, or no symptoms, I have seen the results of two days of nasopharynx swab.
■安静的医院2 月 6 日，隔离第 8 天，天气晴我想总结一下确诊以来这么多天的感受。
Quiet Hospital February 6, Isolation Day 8, the weather fine I want to summarize the feelings since the diagnosis so many days.
一开始是我的亲人被确诊，想到 2003 年「非典」那些感染者后来生活都有很大的影响，我其实是挺担心的。
At first, my relatives were diagnosed, and I was really worried about the impact of those infected with SARS in 2003.
本来今年我和太太想要个宝宝的，这个病毒打乱了我们所有的计划。
My wife and I wanted to have a baby this year, and the virus upset all our plans.
但自己确诊后，心态反而没有那么惶恐了。
But after his diagnosis, the mentality is not so frightened.
我自己平常坚持锻炼，还算强壮，主要是担心家人。
I keep exercising myself, and I'm strong, mainly because I worry about my family.
还有就是关于隐私保护的问题。
And then there is the issue of privacy protection.
我们在小县城被确诊以后，不仅是我们，还有很多家的住址、身份证号码还有头像都向社会公布了。
After we were diagnosed in the small county town, not only we, but also a lot of home address, ID card number and head of the public were disclosed.
我觉得公布部分信息没问题，要做好排查，但全部公布出去难道不也是对公民隐私的一种侵犯吗？我和我的病友们都很乐观。
I think it's OK to release some of the information, to do a good job of sorting it out, but isn't it a violation of citizens' privacy to make it public?
有个扶贫干部也住了进来。
A pro-poor cadre also came in.
他是在不知情的情况下，做好事，拉了几个顺路人，没想到其中有人是从湖北来的。
Unbeknownst to him, he did good deeds and pulled a few passers-by, some of whom were from Hubei Province.
还有好多人也是不知道怎么就传染上了，因为各种各样的原因进来了。
There are also a lot of people do not know how to infect, because a variety of reasons came in.
但大家都没有怨天尤人，非常乐观积极。
But no one complained, very optimistic and positive.
事情发生了就发生了，我们用最好的状态来面对它。
Things happen and we face them at their best.
■往日的武汉地铁 2 号线最后我想用 《南方周末》鼓舞过无数人的一段话来结尾：在这个时刻，我们无言以对，惟有祝福：让无力者有力，让悲观者前行，让往前走的继续走，让幸福的人儿更幸福；而我们，在不停为你加油。
Finally, I would like to conclude with a line from Southern Weekend, which has inspired countless people: At this moment, we have nothing to say but bless: Let the powerless be strong, let the pessimist go on, let go on, let the happy people be happier; and we, keep cheering for you.
