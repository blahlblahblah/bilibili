澎湃新闻记者 李思文 实习生 夏梦洁“熔喷布（价格）涨了10倍，耳带（价格）涨了5倍多。
Li Si-wen a journalist Li Mengjie, an intern, said: "The melts have increased tenfold and the ear band has gone up more than fivefold.
”近日，浙江一家医用卫生产品生产企业的负责人如此告诉澎湃新闻，企业在满负荷生产的同时，也承担着成本翻倍的压力。
In Zhejiang, the head of a medical product manufacturer told the roar news recently that companies were under pressure to double costs while producing at full capacity.
其中，熔喷布作为口罩过滤病菌的核心材料，在短短一个月内价格由2万/吨，暴涨至20-30万/吨。
Molten cloth, the core material used to filter out germs, jumped from 20,000 tons to 200,000 to 300,000 tons in just one month.
澎湃新闻采访多家相关企业了解到，熔喷布企业、熔喷布专用料企业面临着生产线紧缺、生产要求高、设备采购周期长等问题，产能远远无法满足市场需求，致使供需失衡，部分口罩厂有机器、有工人，但缺少熔喷布，且在“天价”下仍“一布难求”。
Peng Pai news interviews with a number of related enterprises, melt-jet fabric enterprises face production lines, high production requirements, equipment procurement cycle, and other problems, production capacity far from meet market demand, resulting in an imbalance between supply and demand, some mask factory machinery, workers, but lack of melting cloth, and "sky-high prices."
有熔喷布生产企业负责人提醒，利益驱动下，不具备隔离病菌作用的熔喷布也开始越来越多混入市场，或将导致不具隔离病毒作用的“假医用口罩”泛滥。
There are melt-jet production enterprises reminded, profit-driven, do not have the role of isolation bacteria also began to more and more into the market, or will lead to no isolation of the virus effect of "fake medical masks" overflow.
现状：熔喷布价格涨至10倍，企业承受压力孟和平的企业是四川一家2月3日开始转产生产医用口罩的民营企业，此时，熔喷布的价格已经有所上涨。
Status: Melt-jet prices have risen tenfold, and companies under pressure Bangladesh peace is a Sichuan private enterprise that began producing medical masks on February 3, when the price of melts has risen.
他说，2月8日，他进货的价格为4万/吨，10天后价格涨，通过当地政府协调，他才以18万元的价格买下一吨材料，27日，他又被告知熔喷布售价已经是25万/吨。
He said he was getting 40,000 tons on February 8, that prices were up 10 days later, that he was able to buy a ton of materials for 180,000 yuan through local government coordination, and he was told on 27 February that the melt-jet was selling for 250,000 tons.
而年前，一吨熔喷布只需2万元。
A year ago, a ton of molten cloth cost only 20,000 yuan.
短短30天，一吨熔喷布的价格已经上涨至十几倍。
In just 30 days, the price of a tonne of spray has risen tenfold.
但一路猛涨的熔喷布价格，是所有生产医用口罩企业都绕不开的坎。
But all the way up the price of molten cloth, is all the production of medical mask enterprises can not around the bar.
“医用口罩有三层，熔喷布是中间一层，具有很强的过滤性、屏蔽性、绝热性，能起到杀菌、隔离病毒的作用，可以说是一个医用口罩的‘心脏’。
"There are three layers of medical masks, the molten cloth is the middle layer, with a strong filter, shielding, insulation, can play the role of sterilization, isolation of the virus, can be said to be a medical mask 'heart.
”孟平和介绍称，“一吨熔喷布能生产五六十万个医用口罩，我们现在的材料只能再维持生产10-20天。
"One ton of spray can produce five to six hundred thousand medical masks, and we now have only 10 to 20 more days of production," Meng said.
”孟平和说，他的企业自担费用生产医用口罩，免费派发给当地居民使用，“天价”熔喷布让他陷入了困局，“我们也在到处找熔喷布，前几天有人说另一个地方有货，25万一吨要不要，我说不要，真的是太贵了。
Meng Ping said his company paid for the production of medical masks for free distribution to local residents, and that the "sky-high" melting pot has left him in trouble.
”专业生产口罩的浙江金华久瑞口罩厂，比孟平和更早感知到了熔喷布的涨价，总经理叶振浩介绍说：“从过年前就已经开始涨了，以前一般都是2万一吨，年前开始一路猛涨，现在有的最高已经卖到了30多万。
"Zhejiang Jinhua Jiurui Mask Factory, which specializes in producing masks, is more aware of the increase in the price of melts than Meng Ping and earlier," said Ye Zhenhao, general manager of the mask manufacturer.
”原材料上涨后，叶振浩的口罩厂生存也越发困难，“疫情下，原本熔喷布进货就很困难，现在涨了那么多，成本就要跟着上去，厂家想不亏本就要涨医用口罩价格，但现在国家限制了医用口罩的价格，我们赚不到钱，还可能要赔本，国内市场现在很难做，做外贸还好一些。
"With the epidemic, it has become more difficult to get supplies into the factory," he said. "Now the cost is going up so much that manufacturers want to increase the price of medical masks without losing money.
”自1月27日开工生产医用口罩起，浙江安普森医疗器械有限公司（以下简称安普森医疗）就面临着熔喷布短缺的问题，曾和其他数家医用口罩生产企业，联系浙江本地媒体急寻原材料供应商。
Since January 27, when work began on the production of medical masks, Zhejiang Ampson Medical Device Co., Ltd. has faced a shortage of melts and contacted several other manufacturers of medical masks to contact local media outlets in Zhejiang looking for raw materials suppliers.
如今开工一个多月后，安普森医疗依然面临着熔喷布难题。
More than a month after the start of the work, Amson Medical is still facing a melting pot.
“现在熔喷布已经涨了10倍多，而且想买也买不到。
"It's more than 10 times as much now and I can't buy it," he said.
”该公司总经理姜江说，生产熔喷布的企业相对较少，以往他所在的企业都是从杭州、湖南、江苏等地不同的厂家进货，在春节期间，因工厂未复工，一度原材料短缺，后续慢慢恢复。
Jiang Jiang, the company's general manager, said relatively few companies were producing melts, and that his company used to buy goods from different factories in Hangzhou, Hunan and Jiangsu.
但在十多天前，市场上的熔喷布再次出现了“一布难求”的情况。
But more than a decade ago, the melting pot in the market was once again "hard to find."
“目前像熔喷布这种面料都是保证当地使用，我们外地就很难买了。
"At the moment, fabrics such as molten cloth are guaranteed for local use, so it's hard for us to buy them in the field.
”姜江说，目前厂里使用的熔喷布都是托熟人进货，但也只有少量货源。
Mr. Jiang said the melts used in the factory are bought by acquaintances, but only in small quantities.
姜江还认为，大量企业涌入医用口罩市场，也让熔喷布价格水涨船高。
Jiang also believes that the influx of enterprises into the medical mask market, also let the price of melts skyrocket.
“现在除了口罩厂扩大生产线，很多企业都转产医用口罩，尤其是大企业，他们资金充足，能够一次囤大量的熔喷布，我们专业生产口罩的小企业就更难买到货了。
"In addition to expanding their mask factories, many companies are switching to medical masks, especially in larger companies, which have the wherewithal to hoard large quantities of spray at a time, making it harder for our small businesses, which specialize in masks, to buy them.
”除了熔喷布的价格上涨，其他口罩原材料也面临着涨价问题，姜江告诉澎湃新闻，口罩用的耳带（松紧带）是在原材料中涨价幅度第二大的，目前已经涨了5倍多，虽然没有面临购买困难的问题，但原材料价格猛涨，给企业带来了不小的压力。
In addition to the increase in the price of melts and other raw materials for masks, Jiang told the stormy news that the band used to raise the muzzle - the second-largest increase in raw materials - has risen more than fivefold.
“以前我们生产一个普通医用口罩的成本只要几毛钱，现在随着原材料涨价，成本翻倍，已经要1块多了，但政府设置了最高采购价，我们企业就很困难了。
"We used to pay a few cents for a common medical mask, but now it's more than a dollar as raw materials go up and costs double," he said.
”姜江说。
"said Jiang.
溯源：熔喷布产能低，企业称主要是中间商在加价熔喷布价格猛涨，原料生产企业状况如何？湖南盛锦新材料有限公司是生产熔喷布专用料的龙头企业，“我们生产的是熔喷布原料粒子，就是一种聚丙烯颗粒，把颗粒融化后通过工艺喷到布上，就能起到阻隔、防护的作用。
2007-08-30 16: 19 2007-08-19 19: 19 2007-06-19 19: 19 2007-06-19 19: 19 2007-06-19 19: 19 2007-06-19 19: 19 2007-06-19 19: 19 2007-06-19 19: 19 2007-06-19 19: 19 2007-11-19 19: 23
”该公司一负责人田伯陵告诉澎湃新闻，公司自1月28日全面复工，并保持满负荷生产，依然无法满足熔喷布专用料的需求。
Tian Bo-ling, a director of the company, told Peng Pai News that the company, which had been fully operational since January 28 and maintained full capacity, was still unable to meet the demand for fusible jet materials.
“现在接单已经全部满了，其他的订单都要等到3月15日后才能继续接，现在只能满足老客户，对新客户已经没有能力接单了。
"Now that the order is fully filled and all other orders cannot be taken until after March 15th, it will only be available to regular customers, who are no longer able to take orders from new customers.
”田伯陵说，现在公司接单都是主要按照工信部保供名单，提供给名单上支柱型大企业，许多小企业无法顾及。
Mr. Tian says orders are now being sent to big, mainstay businesses that many small businesses can't manage, largely on a list guaranteed by the ministry.
在医用口罩、熔喷布、熔喷布专用料、原材料这个链条里，专用料是最重要环节。
In the medical mask, spray cloth, special materials, raw materials, this chain, special materials is the most important link.
田伯陵介绍称，生产熔喷布专用料的主要原料为聚丙烯（Polypropylene），材料供给主要来自中国石化。
Polypropylene, the main raw material for the production of fueljet, is supplied mainly by Sinopec, Tian Bo-ling said.
据公开报道，2月18日，中石化、中石油均紧急调整生产装置来生产医用聚烯烃以满足无纺布聚丙烯纤维专用料、医用聚丙烯专用料等医用物资原料的需求。
According to public reports, on Feb. 18, Sinopec and PetroChina both made emergency adjustments to their production equipment to produce medical polyolefin to meet the demand for medical materials such as special materials for nonwoven polypropylene fiber and polypropylene for medical use.
从聚丙烯到熔喷布专用料，卡在哪里？“主要就是产能有限，验收标准高。
From polypropylene to molten cloth special materials, where card? "The main production capacity is limited, high acceptance criteria.
”田伯陵说，目前国内无纺布厂较多，但由于熔喷布专用料利润低、技术要求高，属于小众偏门的领域，生产厂商非常少，“能存活下来的基本上只有几个大型企业。
Tian said there were more domestic non-woven factories, but because of low profits and high technical requirements for the special materials used for spraying, there were very few producers and "basically only a few large enterprises will survive.
”田伯陵介绍称，目前一条专用料生产线一天能生产10-15吨专用料，假设全国有50条生产线，一天也只能供应500-600吨。
Currently, a dedicated material production line can produce 10-15 tons of specialized materials a day, and assuming there are 50 production lines nationwide, it can supply only 500-600 tons a day, Tian said.
“现在大家都在大量上口罩机，以为有口罩机就能解决问题，但上完后发现缺熔喷布，上了熔喷布生产线后又发现没有专用料，其实这是一环扣一环的。
"People are wearing masks a lot now, thinking that a mask machine will solve the problem. But when they finish, they find that there is no special material after they are put on the production line.
”不过，田伯陵成，在激增的需求量和熔喷布高涨的价格下，熔喷布专用料利润却没有太大变化，“生产熔喷布的企业找我们买专用料才1万/吨，生产后熔喷布卖到20多万/吨，在黑市上甚至炒到40万/吨。
However, Tian Bo Ling-cheng, in the face of surging demand and soaring prices, did not see much change in the profits from the use of melt-jet materials: "Molten fabric manufacturers are looking for us to buy only 10,000 tons of special materials, after production more than 200,000 tons of melting cloth, and even speculation on the black market of 400,000 per ton.
”虽然上游决定产量，但利润基本都在下游。
Although output is determined upstream, profits are mostly downstream.
而在专用料的下游，熔喷布生产企业也有压力。
And in the specialized material downstream, the melt-jet production enterprise also has the pressure.
湖北迈尔特新材料有限公司（以下简称“迈尔特”）是仙桃市最大的熔喷布生产企业，对于目前一路走高的熔喷布价格，该公司一负责人党中华称，更多是中间商在炒作，“现在熔喷布的价格非常混乱，我们的出厂价实际都不高，主要是中间商在中间加价出售。
Hubei Marter New Materials Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Mayr") is the largest manufacturer of melts in Xiantao City, the company's head of the party, China, said that the current high prices, the company is more intermediary speculation, "the price is very chaotic, our factory prices are not really high, mainly middlemen selling in the middle.
”他告诉澎湃新闻，目前利润只是相比以往有小幅度增加，但面临的问题却更多了。
He told the roaring news that profits were only marginally higher than they had been in the past but faced more problems.
党中华告诉澎湃新闻，他们现在只有一条生产线，一天的熔喷布产量约可以支持生产250万只一次性医用口罩，但仍严重不足，“即使我们产能翻10倍都不够。
The party told the news that it now has only one production line and that a one-day production line could support the production of about 2.5 million disposable medical masks, but there is still a serious shortage, "even if we can double our capacity tenfold."
”他说。
'he said.
作为湖北仙桃市疫情防控物资重点生产企业之一，迈尔特生产熔喷布需主要保障湖北地区熔喷布供应，“我们现在已经把其他地方客户的合同全悔了，所有客户都想要货，但我们连湖北本地的企业都保障不了。
As one of the key manufacturers of epidemic prevention and control materials in Xiantao, Hubei Province, we mainly need to ensure the supply of melts in Hubei region. "We have now completely regretted the contracts of customers elsewhere, all customers want goods, but we can not guarantee Hubei local enterprises.
”党中华说，以往生产线每天只运营8小时，如今已经是24小时生产，依然供不应求。
The party says production lines, which used to operate for only eight hours a day, are running around the clock and are still in short supply.
党中华也考虑过增加生产线，但设备生产周期太长，增加一条生产线至少需要8个月的时间，解决不了燃眉之急。
The party has also considered adding production lines, but the production cycle is too long and it will take at least eight months for an additional production line to meet the immediate needs.
最让党中华忧心的是客源问题，“现在为了保障湖北供应，我们已经全部推掉了外地的企业，停止供应，外地客源就要找其他厂商合作，这意味着这等疫情过去后，我们可能会面临客户大面积丢失的问题，就涉及到我们企业生死存亡的问题了。
What worries the Party most about China is the customer source problem. "Now, to ensure Hubei supply, we have eliminated all foreign enterprises, stopped supply, and foreign customers will have to seek the cooperation of other manufacturers, which means that after this epidemic, we may face the problem of large-scale customer loss, involving the survival of our enterprise.
”他说，不知道疫情过后自己的企业还能否生产下去。
He said he did not know whether his company would be able to produce after the outbreak.
提醒：警惕不达标熔喷布，企业建议加强监管需求激增、售价猛涨，熔喷布的质量问题也面临考验。
Caution: Be wary of substandard sprays. Firms propose to tighten regulatory requirements, inflate prices, and test the quality of melts.
“只能说假货年年有，今年特别多。
"It can only be said that fakes occur every year, especially this year.
”安普森医疗总经理姜江告诉澎湃新闻，劣质熔喷布在市场上一直都存在。
Jiang Jiang, the general manager of Ampson health care, told Pong Pai News that shoddy melts had always been on the market.
他称，此前口罩厂大多和熟悉的熔喷布厂商合作，如今在需求激增、部分熔喷布厂家被当地监管、口罩厂不得不重新找货源的情况下，劣质熔喷布或将泛滥。
Previously, he said, mask factories have mostly worked with familiar manufacturers, and now shoddy showers are likely to proliferate amid surging demand, local regulation of parts of the smelters and the need for mask factories to restock them.
姜江说，真“假”熔喷布比较难辨认，需要进行专业检测，检测成本高，但生产低劣熔喷布却比较容易，“熔喷布都需要达到一定的过滤效果和指标，假熔喷布就达不到标准，就是起不到防护病毒的作用，有的假货甚至连静电吸附都不达标，也就没有隔离病毒的效果了。
Real "fake" melts are harder to identify, require professional testing and are expensive to test, Jiang said. But they are relatively easy to produce. "Molten fabrics need to meet certain filtering effects and targets, fake melts fail to meet the standards, some fake goods even substandard static adsorption, there is no isolation effect of the virus.
”田伯陵从熔喷布专用料的角度进行了分析。
"Tian Bo Ling from the perspective of the special materials for spray cloth analysis.
他告诉澎湃新闻，医用口罩里外两层都只是支撑作用，过滤病毒最重要的就是中间的熔喷布，普通熔喷布过滤效率为50%，需再加工增加静电吸附后，才能达到细菌过滤99%以上（简称BFE99）。
He told the roar news that the inside and outside of the mask only support, the most important filtering virus is the middle of the melting cloth, ordinary melting cloth filter efficiency of 50%, need to re-processing to increase electrostatic adsorption, can reach more than 99% (BFE99).
“滤效50%的熔喷布只能做民用防护口罩，只能防尘、防灰，隔离不了病毒，但所有医用口罩、外科手术口罩，都必须用滤效99%的熔喷布。
"Fifty percent of the fabric can only be used as a civilian respirator. It can only protect against dust, dust and viruses, but all medical masks and surgical masks must be sprayed with a 99% spray.
”田伯陵介绍称，生产滤效99%熔喷布耗时较长，会降低产能，在利益的驱动下，就可能有人“造假”，“造假就是说会生产一些达不到标准的熔喷布，做成口罩后明明是民用防护口罩，没有防护病毒作用，却非说是99%的医用口罩。
The production of 99 per cent of the fabric takes longer to produce, reducing production capacity and could be driven by profit, "Tian said." Fraudulent means producing substandard sprays with a civilian face mask behind which there is no protection, but not 99 per cent of medical masks.
”2月26日，国务院应对新型冠状病毒感染肺炎疫情联防联控机制举行新闻发布会，公安部介绍，已侦破制售假劣口罩等防护物资的案件688起，抓获犯罪嫌疑人1560余名，查扣伪劣口罩3100余万只及一批防护物资，涉案价值达到1.74亿元。
On February 26, the State Council held a press conference on the joint control mechanism for the new coronavirus infection with pneumonia. The Ministry of Public Security said it had cracked 688 cases involving the production and sale of fake and inferior masks, arrested more than 1,560 criminal suspects, confiscated more than 31 million fake and inferior masks and made a batch of protective materials worth 174 million yuan.
其中，7成通过微信朋友圈及微商售卖。
Among them, 7% through the micro-letter circle and micro-business sales.
作为熔喷布的生产企业，党中华告诉澎湃新闻，他了解到目前市面上假冒伪劣的熔喷布比较多，希望有关部门能够加强管控，在严查假冒伪劣、三无医用口罩的同时，也应该加强对熔喷布产品的监管。
As a melt-blown production enterprises, the party China told Peng Pai news, he learned that the market is more fake and shoddy spray cloth, hope that the relevant departments can strengthen control, in strict detection of counterfeit, shoddy, three non-medical masks, but also to strengthen the supervision of melt-blown products.
“老百姓自己是很难分辨医用口罩里熔喷布的好坏，如果购买的医用口罩没有防护效果，危害会比较大。
"The people themselves are very difficult to distinguish between the medical mask in the good or bad, if the purchase of medical masks without protection, the harm will be greater.
