虽然受疫情影响巨大，但大宗原材料行业普遍预计疫情结束后的需求反弹将带动行业回暖李斯洋| 文马克| 编辑图/视觉中国新冠疫情给油气、煤炭、钢铁、有色金属等这些关乎国民经济命脉的大宗原材料价格造成巨大波动，也给与之紧密相关的能源、电力、冶金、化工等周期性行业蒙上阴影。
Despite the magnitude of the epidemic, the bulk-materials industry generally expects a post-epidemic rebound in demand to help keep industry warm. & # 160; Editing charts / Vision China's new crown has caused huge price swings for oil, gas, coal, steel, non-ferrous metals, which are vital to the nation's economy, and has cast a shadow over closely related cyclical sectors such as energy, electricity, metallurgy and chemicals.
疫情至今，国际原油期货价格创下五年来最大周跌幅；国际铜期货价格也在疫情伊始时连续下跌，创下六年来持续时间最长的连降期；彭博大宗商品总回报指数（Bloomberg Commodity Total Return Index）也创下去年8月以来的最低收盘点位。
The epidemic has so far seen the biggest weekly decline in international crude oil futures prices in five years; international copper futures have also fallen at the start of the epidemic, marking the longest consecutive decline in six years; and Pemberg's Bloomberg Commodity Total Return Index hit its lowest close since August.
疫情打乱了国内大宗原材料行业的生产节奏。
The outbreak disrupted the pace of production in the domestic bulk raw materials industry.
晋陕蒙煤炭主产区2月初的复产率普遍不及50%，煤炭供应萎缩的压力向下游焦化行业和电力行业传导。
Jin Shaanxi coal major production area in early February, the rate of return is generally less than 50%, the pressure of shrinking coal supply to downstream coking industry and power industry conduction.
而下游需求的急剧萎缩和交通运输的不畅，又使成品油和硫酸胀库、钢料钢材爆仓，倒逼化工行业和冶金行业压减产量。
And the rapid contraction of the downstream demand and traffic flow, and the expansion of oil and sulfuric acid, steel depositions, forced the chemical and metallurgical industries to reduce production.
供需双双走弱使得大宗工业原材料价格成了最捉摸不定的因素，现金流危机率先在那些高负债的中小型企业身上出现。
Weakness in supply and demand has made commodity prices the most volatile of all, with the cash flow crisis leading to the emergence of highly indebted small and medium-sized enterprises.
为支持企业应对危机，2月1日，央行、财政部、银保监会、证监会、外汇局五部委联合发布《关于进一步强化金融支持防控新型冠状病毒感染肺炎疫情的通知》。
To support enterprises in coping with the crisis, on February 1, the central bank, the Ministry of Finance, the CBRC, the CSRC and the SAFE jointly issued the Notice on Further Strengthening Financial Support for the Prevention and Control of the New Coronavirus Infection Pneumonia.

As of March 1, 13 provinces (cities and districts) had published lists of investment plans for key projects in 2020, of which eight provinces invested 2.8 trillion yuan annually, with infrastructure investment accounting for the largest share.
展望未来，行业普遍预计货币政策会转向相对宽松，财政政策也将更加积极，这是大宗原材料行业可以期待的“春天”。
Looking ahead, the industry generally expects monetary policy to shift to relative easing and fiscal policy to be more aggressive, a "spring" that the raw material industry can expect.
石油：库存高企，价格走低作为“工业的血液”，石油是国际化程度非常高的大宗商品。
Oil: High inventories, low prices as "industrial blood," oil is a very high degree of international commodity.
2019年中国全年原油进口量超过5亿吨，石油消费量达6.9亿吨，占全球总消费量14.5%，中国的石油对外依存度升至72%。
In 2019, China imported more than 500 million tons of crude oil and consumed 690 million tons of oil, accounting for 14.5 per cent of total global consumption.
突如其来的新冠疫情，给这个世界第一大原油进口国和世界第二大石油消费国带来巨大冲击。
The sudden outbreak of the new crown has hit the world's largest oil importer and the world's second-largest oil consumer.
疫情爆发以来，布伦特原油从1月20日65.98美元/桶跌至2月28日49.92美元/桶。

国际各大能源或咨询机构均对疫情“黑天鹅”冲击下的国际油价抱以悲观态度。
Major international energy or consulting agencies are pessimistic about the impact of the "black swan" international oil prices.
国际能源署2月最新出版的《石油市场报告》中认为，2020年全球石油消费仅增长82.5万桶/日，比年初的日增幅预测下调36.5万桶/日，是2011年以来最低的增长速度。
According to the latest report on the oil market, published by the International Energy Agency in February, global oil consumption rose by only 825,000 barrels per day in 2020, a 365,000 bpd lower than the daily forecast at the beginning of the year and the slowest since 2011.
据国际知名能源咨询公司埃士信华迈（IHS）预测，今年一季度全球石油消费的同比增量将由此前预计的60万桶/日降为-50万桶/日左右，上一次负增长出现在2008年全球金融危机。
The year-on-year increase in global oil consumption in the first quarter will fall to -500,000 b / d from an earlier estimate of 600,000 b / d, according to IHS, an internationally renowned energy consultancy.
国际能源署预测，2020年一季度全球石油消费量年化计算后将下降43.5万桶/日，是10多年来第一次全球性的石油消费下滑。
The IEA predicts global oil consumption will decline by 435,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2020, the first global decline in oil consumption in more than a decade.
近年来，持续走弱的国际油价很大程度上依赖中国市场的支撑，石油输出国组织（OPEC）多次组织成员国联合减产来提振油价，但都被增产势头强劲的美国、俄罗斯拉低。
In recent years, persistently weak international oil prices have relied heavily on the support of the Chinese market, with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) repeatedly organizing joint production cuts by member countries to boost oil prices, all of which have been pulled down by the US and Russia, which have increased production.
“OPEC的减产追赶不上非OPEC国家的增产，使得2020年全球石油市场的供应过剩局面更加严重，而新冠疫情的爆发，又让供需缺口拉得更大。
"OPEC production cuts are not catching up with increases in non-OPEC countries, exacerbating the oversupply situation in the global oil market in 2020, while the outbreak of the new crown has pushed the supply and demand gap even further."
”中石油国际部综合处处长陆如泉告诉《财经》记者。
Lu Ruquan, head of PetroChina's international division, told Caijing.
随着疫情向全世界蔓延，日本、韩国等石油进口大国纷纷出现疫情恶化趋势，对石油需求的打击面将进一步扩大，反映在油价上就是自2月20日以来的连续暴跌。
As the epidemic spreads around the world, major oil-importing countries such as Japan and South Korea have experienced a worsening epidemic, which will further expand the impact of oil demand, as reflected in the sharp drop in oil prices since February 20.
由于伊朗疫情严重，全球最大产油区中东未来局面也不确定，伊朗的石油出口在美国制裁之下已经很少，但其疫情若蔓延到其他产油国，对供应端就会产生重大影响。
Given the severity of the Iranian epidemic and uncertainty about the future of the Middle East, the world's largest oil-producing region, Iran's oil exports are already rare under US sanctions, but its spread to other oil-producing countries could have a significant impact on the supply side.
对国内产业链来说，国际原油价格波动影响最为直接的是石油炼化行业。
For the domestic industry chain, the most direct impact of the fluctuation of international crude oil prices is the petroleum refining industry.
“从历史上看，国际原油价格下跌对国内炼厂是利好。
"Historically, the decline in international crude oil prices has been positive for domestic refiners.
但这一次疫情是‘双跌’，不仅原油跌，成品油也大幅跳水。
But this time the epidemic is' double-dip ', not only crude oil fell, products also plunged.
”陆如泉说。
"said Lu.
疫情使得占成品油消费总量60%~70%的交通运输业遭受重创。
The epidemic has taken a heavy toll on the transport industry, which accounts for 60% to 70% of total fuel consumption.
根据交通运输部数据显示，今年春运40天（1月10日~2月18日）全国铁路、公路、水路、民航共发送旅客14.8亿人次，比去年同期下降50.3%。
According to Ministry of Transport data, 1.48 billion passenger trips were sent by railways, highways, waterways and civil aviation in the spring of this year, a decrease of 50.3 percent over the same period last year.
受此影响，预计今年前两月的成品油消费量同比下滑近三成。
As a result, oil consumption is expected to fall nearly 30% year on year in the first two months of this year.
陆如泉认为，即便疫情从3月起得到有效控制，石油消费量也难以迅速恢复。
Even if the outbreak is effectively contained from March onwards, Mr Rudd argues, it will be difficult for oil consumption to recover quickly.
由于销路不畅，多数成品油库存处在中高位。
Most refined oil stocks are at medium to high levels because of poor sales.
国家能源局2月21日披露的数据显示，国内成品油库存高达2110万吨，接近“三桶油”（中石油、中石化、中海油）的库容上限。
China has 21.1 million tons of refined oil in stock, close to the cap on the capacity of three barrels of oil, PetroChina, Sinopec and CNOOC, according to figures released February 21 by the State Energy Administration.
隆众数据显示，截至1月30日，山东省地方炼厂样本企业汽油库存52.71%（库存占库容的比），柴油库存50.03%，汽柴油库存均超过2019年以来的40%警戒库存。
As of Jan. 30, 2007, local refineries in Shandong Province had 52.71% of their gasoline inventory (stock as a percentage of capacity), 50.03% of diesel oil, and more than 40% of its gasoline and diesel stockpiles since 2019.
“按目前‘三桶油’的成品油库存，在中国不加工一滴原油的情况下，仍然能满足国内一个月的成品油需求；如果按疫情期间的消费情况，满足两个月都不成问题。
"With the current stockpile of 'three barrels of oil', we can still meet our domestic oil needs for a month without a drop of crude oil being processed in China; two months would not be a problem, given the consumption patterns during the outbreak.
”海通期货能源化工研发负责人杨安告诉《财经》记者。
Yang An, head of research and development for Haitong Futures Energy, told Caijing.
高库存不仅使得炼厂被迫压减产量，也大幅侵蚀炼厂的效益。
High inventories have not only forced refineries to reduce production, but have also significantly eroded refinery performance.
中石化和中石油已分别计划将其2月份目标原油加工量压缩80万桶/日和30万桶/日；“地炼企业可能压产100万桶/日，仅30%~40%的开工率已降至五年来的最低位，中小企业的日子将更加难熬。
Sinopec and PetroChina have planned to reduce their February target crude oil processing by 800,000 bpd and 300,000 bpd, respectively; "SMEs will have a harder time with land refiners with a potential output of 1m bpd and a start rate of only 30-40 per cent has fallen to a five-year low."
”杨安说。
"said Yang'an.
国家和地方的财税和金融单位已陆续出台相关优惠措施缓解中小企业的现金流压力。
National and local fiscal and financial units have introduced preferential measures to ease the cash flow pressure of small and medium-sized enterprises.
除了央行注入流动性外，占全国地炼产能65%的山东省也出台了金融、税费等方面的支持政策。
In addition to the central bank's liquidity injection, Shandong Province, which accounts for 65% of China's capacity, has introduced financial, tax and other support policies.
上海期货交易所（下称“上期所”）也提高了原油期货的套期保值审批效率，交易数据显示，疫情带来的原油价格波动增加了企业风险对冲需求，原油期货持仓规模呈快速放大趋势，截至3月5日收盘，持仓量达到81144手，创历史新高。
The Shanghai Futures Exchange (hereinafter referred to as "the previous period") also increased the efficiency of hedging examination and approval of crude oil futures, the transaction data showed that the epidemic of crude oil price fluctuations increased the risk hedging needs of enterprises, crude oil futures positions showed a rapid trend of magnification, as March 5 closed at 81,144 holdings, a record high.
疫情结束后，需求释放叠加政府对基建、旧改等领域的经济刺激政策，石油的行情有望走强。
After the outbreak of the epidemic, the demand release superimposed on the government's infrastructure, old reform and other areas of economic stimulus policies, oil prices are expected to strengthen.
现阶段考虑到国际油价行情和疫情期间为企业纾困的要求，国家发改委于2月4日和18日两次下调成品油价格。
At this stage, the National Development and Reform Commission lowered oil prices twice, on 4 and 18 February, taking into account international oil prices and the requirements for enterprise bail-outs during the epidemic.
成品油贸易商也在加大买入和囤货的力度，社会库存飙升。
Oil traders are also stepping up efforts to buy and hoard goods, and social inventories are soaring.
“据我们的调研，贸易商对成品油未来价格反弹普遍充满信心。
"According to our research, traders are generally confident that oil prices will rebound in the future.
”杨安说。
"said Yang'an.
陆如泉认为，国际油价的走低意味着全球油气供需宽松局面的持续，中国能源安全的紧张局面将得到进一步缓解。
Mr Lu believes that lower international oil prices mean continued global oil and gas supply and demand easing will further ease tensions over China's energy security.
“还有一个必须考虑的问题是，根据中美1月15日达成的第一阶段经济贸易协议，中国今明两年将在2017年基础上扩大进口美国能源产品524亿美元。
"Another issue to consider is that China will expand imports of US energy products by $52.4 billion this year and next from 2017 under the first phase of the economic and trade agreement reached between China and the US on January 15.
”陆如泉认为，突如其来的疫情降低了我国的油气需求，变相增加了从美国进口能源产品的难度，意味着我们的履约难度在增加。
Mr Lu believes that the sudden outbreak of the disease has reduced China's oil and gas demand and disguised the difficulty of importing energy products from the US, making it more difficult for us to do so.
“相比于俄罗斯和卡塔尔，美国的能源产品并没有价格优势。
"US energy products have no price advantage over Russia and Qatar.
”煤炭：产能基本恢复2020年春节较早，大部分煤矿于1月20日前后开始放假，仅部分国有大矿维持正常生产，主要承担保供应任务。

The Caijing reporter found that the amount of special-purpose debt issued by the provinces (cities / districts) reached 537.5 billion yuan in January, an increase of nearly 3.8 times that of January last year.
上海泽铁咨询CEO李志斌告诉《财经》，如果按行业内1亿投资对应3300吨钢需求的说法，这一波基建投资将至少带来2%的钢产量同比增长，“但这仅是疫情爆发前的预测。
According to Caijing, Li Zhibin, chief executive of Zettel, told Caijing that the capital investment would generate at least 2 per cent year-on-year growth in steel production on the basis of 300 tons of steel required for 100 million investments in the industry, "but only before the outbreak.
”为控制可能带来的产能飙升，1月23日，国家发改委、工信部发布《关于完善钢铁产能置换和项目备案工作的通知》紧急叫停了钢铁产能置换和项目备案，以遏制置换过程中通过“数字游戏”变相扩大产能的行为。
On January 23, the NDRC and the Ministry of Industry and Communications issued a notice on improving steel production capacity replacement and project filing to halt steel capacity replacements and project filings in an attempt to curb the disguised expansion of capacity through "digital games."
“钢厂这几年效益很好，对未来信心很足，认为疫情对下游需求的冲击是暂时的，需求未来会迎来集中式的爆发。
"The mills have been doing well in recent years and are confident of the future, believing that the impact of the epidemic on downstream demand is temporary and that there will be a concentrated outburst of demand in the future."
”徐向春表示，虽然近几周的产量环比有所下降，但降幅不大，主要是焦炭供应不畅所致，钢厂主动限产的意愿并不强。
Mr Xu said that while the ring-to-loop production had fallen in recent weeks, the decline had been small, mainly due to poor coke supply and a lack of willingness on the part of steel mills to limit production.
尽管未来的“春天”可期，但熬过眼下这个“寒冬”才是头等大事。
Despite the prospect of spring, surviving the current winter is the number one priority.
“巨大的钢厂库存积压将使钢价不再坚挺。
"A huge stock of steel mills will make steel prices no longer firm."
”南钢首席期现货分析师蔡拥政告诉《财经》记者，一面是焦炭等原料供应紧张，价格高位，一面是钢材的库存高，价格低位，整个2月份钢企将面临负向剪刀差，部分钢企必然出现现金流问题。
Cai Yongzheng, chief spot analyst at Nan Gang, told Caijing that the tight supply of raw materials such as coke and high prices combined with high steel inventories and low prices meant steel companies would face negative cutbacks throughout February and cash flow problems for some steelmakers.
目前，高库存带来的钢价下跌对钢厂现金流的挤压已经显现。
At present, high inventory brought down steel prices on the cash flow squeeze has been manifested.
Mysteel数据显示，2月28日钢材现货综合成交价跌至3700元/吨，同比下降8%，创2017年6月以来新低；上期所2月28日螺纹钢期货主力合约rb2005也连续下滑，收3335元/吨。
The spot price of steel fell to 3,700 yuan per tonne on Feb. 28, down 8% from a year earlier, reaching a new low since June 2017, according to Mysteel.
据中钢协统计，中国钢材价格指数（CSPI）2月17日~21日仅为100.55点，低于2019年的最低水平104.28点。
According to China Steel Association statistics, China Steel Price Index (CSPI) February 17 to 21 only 100.55 points, down from 2019, the lowest level of 104.28 points.
如果算上矿煤焦成本，钢厂2月份仅能维持略高于成本线运行。
If coal-coke costs are factored in, steel mills were able to operate only slightly above cost lines in February.
“北方有不少钢厂因为债务负担重，为了保现金流，不得不以成本价至亏损的价格与下游客户签单。
"There are a lot of steel mills in the north that have to sign with downstream customers at cost-to-loss prices to protect their cash flow.
”徐向春说。
"said Xu Xianchun.
疫情发展情况、下游需求释放量能否达到预期仍是市场最关注的问题。
The development of the epidemic, downstream demand release is expected to meet the market is still the most concerned issue.
2月22日中钢协副会长骆铁军在发布会上称，在实现全面小康和稳增长等一系列政策的支撑下，预计钢材需求将从二季度起快速回升。
Steel demand is expected to rebound rapidly from the second quarter on the back of a series of policies aimed at achieving overall well-off and steady growth, Vice President of the China Steel Association Locke said at a press conference.
中钢协还呼吁钢铁企业应把握好生产节奏，主动采取减产、限产措施。
China Steel Association also called on steel enterprises should grasp the rhythm of production, initiative to take measures to reduce production, production.
宏观层面上，央行一系列举措注入流动性的举措也在协助钢铁企业度过难关。
At the macro level, a series of moves by the central bank to inject liquidity are also helping steelmakers tide over difficulties.
钢厂也在通过衍生品手段对冲价格风险，期货市场的活跃度显著提升。
Steel mills are also hedging against price risk through derivatives, and futures markets have become significantly more active.
蔡拥政建议，钢企来此时不宜做卖出保值，应该考虑远期原料成本上涨风险，对矿煤焦做买入保值，或适当考虑一些期权组合策略对冲价格波动风险。
Cai suggested that steel enterprises should not do the hedging at this time, should take into account the risk of rising costs of raw materials, coal mines to buy the value of coking, or due consideration of some options portfolio strategy to hedge the risk of price fluctuations.
有色：硫酸“胀库”是最大威胁中国是有色金属最大需求国，疫情爆发后，伦敦金属交易所（LME）铜期货连续10个交易日（1月20日~31日）下跌，跌幅达11.2%，为六年来持续时间最长的连降期；2月28日收跌5588.5。
Colored: Sulphuric acid "expansion bank" is the biggest threat to China is non-ferrous metals demand, after the outbreak of the London Metal Exchange (LME) copper futures fell 11.2% in 10 consecutive days (January 20-31), the longest consecutive period in six years; February 28 fell 5588.5%.
其他有色金属1月24日~31日也创各自下跌纪录并持续走低至今，如期锌下跌5.6%，期铝下跌3.1%，期铅下跌3.0%，期锡下跌2.4%，期镍下跌1.4%。
Other non-ferrous metals also posted record declines on January 24-31, falling 5.6% for zinc, 3.1% for aluminium, 3.0% for lead, 2.4% for tin and 1.4% for nickel.
春节后国内市场跟进补跌，据上期所交易数据显示，2月上旬铜、铝、铅、锌价格比1月下旬分别下跌6.0%、4.2%、5.6%、3.9%。
Prices of copper, aluminium, lead and zinc fell by 6.0 per cent, 4.2 per cent, 5.6 per cent and 3.9 per cent in early February, respectively, according to figures traded in the previous period.
2月中、下旬国内外市场主要有色金属价格持续在低位运行。
In February, domestic and foreign market prices of major non-ferrous metals continued to operate low.
首当其冲的就是铜产业链。
The first is the copper industrial chain.
由于铜的金融属性很强，市场情绪波动在铜身上的反应更加剧烈。
Because of the strong financial properties of copper, market sentiment fluctuations in copper more violent reaction.
铜也是国际化程度很高的大宗商品品种，中国的铜精矿90%依赖进口。
Copper is also a highly internationalized commodity, with 90 per cent of China's copper concentrate dependent on imports.
与钢厂类似，铜冶炼厂春节期间一般不会停车，故1月份对冶炼厂影响更多的是季节性因素。
Similar to steel mills, copper smelters generally do not stop during Spring Festival, so January's impact on smelters is more seasonal.
一位大型有色冶炼企业的市场负责人告诉《财经》记者，疫情带来的冲击更多体现在2月，由于下游的铜加工和终端制造业未能及时复工复产，物流运输渠道不通畅，推高库存并拉低铜价。
A market leader at a large nonferrous smelter told Caijing that the impact of the epidemic was more felt in February, as downstream copper processing and terminal manufacturing failed to resume operations in a timely manner and logistics lines were not functioning well, driving up inventories and lowering copper prices.
下游需求萎缩，带来的最大威胁是副产硫酸的严重“胀库”。
Downstream demand shrank, and the biggest threat was a severe "sink" of sulphuric acid by-production.
硫酸是铜铅锌冶炼流程中的一个重要副产品，属危险化学品，一旦不能及时被下游产业消纳，冶炼厂库容能力不足将导致被迫压产甚至停工。
Sulphuric acid is an important by-product of copper-lead-zinc smelting process, which is a dangerous chemical. If it can not be absorbed by downstream industry in time, the insufficient capacity of smelter will lead to forced production and even stoppage.
而新冠疫情中心湖北省恰恰是我国硫酸的生产消费大省，产能约1700万吨，占全国产能的13.5%。
Hubei Province, the epicentre of Xinguan epidemic, is China's largest province of sulphuric acid production and consumption, with a capacity of about 17 million tons, accounting for 13.5% of China's capacity.
受疫情影响，硫酸行业整体开工率下降，尤其湖北省内企业下降幅度较大。
Affected by the epidemic, the sulphuric acid industry as a whole began to decline, especially in Hubei Province enterprises decline.
中国硫酸工业协会调研显示，湖北境内的祥云、鄂中、东圣、中东、大峪口等企业目前处于停产状态，新洋丰、三宁、泽东开工率下调至50%，湖北宜化开工率保持在80%的水平。
Research by the China Association of Sulphuric Acid Industry shows that Xiangyun, Hubei, Dongsheng, Middle East and Dayukou enterprises in Hubei Province are now out of production.
硫酸行业本就是产能过剩的行业，在疫情之前，行业总体开工率大约在73%左右。
Sulphuric acid industry is already overcapacity industry, before the epidemic, the overall industry start rate of about 73%.
“副产硫酸销售基本处在成本线以下，很多冶炼厂的副产硫酸到厂价0元/吨也无法消纳。
"By-product sulphuric acid sales are basically below the cost line, many smelters by-production of sulphuric acid to the factory price of 0 yuan / ton can not be absorbed.
”安泰科铜研究首席分析师何笑辉告诉《财经》记者。
Mr Ho, chief analyst at Antéco Copper Research, told Caijing.
国内冶炼厂的原材料铜精矿依赖从智利进口，其现货价格按照LME铜期货基准价扣除加工费（TC/RC，铜精矿转化为精铜的总费用）计算得到，TC/RC依据买卖双方的协议定价，今年谈在62美元/吨。
The spot price of copper concentrate, the raw material for domestic smelters, which is imported from Chile, is calculated on the basis of the LME copper futures benchmark price minus processing fees (TC / RC, the total cost of converting copper concentrate to refined copper), which TC / RC prices are based on an agreement between the buyer and seller of $62 per ton this year.
2019年智利大罢工使得铜精矿供应偏紧，持续走低的TC/RC价格推升了国内冶炼厂的原料成本。
The continuing decline in TC / RC prices pushed up the cost of raw materials for domestic smelters, following a 2019 general strike that strained supplies of copper concentrate.
数据显示，2019年底多家铜冶炼厂出现亏损。
Data show that several copper smelters were losing money at the end of 2019.
为扭转亏损局面，2019年12月26日，中国铜原料谈判小组（CSPT）在福州召开会议号召冶炼企业在2020年联合减产。
On December 26, 2019, the China Copper Raw Materials Negotiating Group (CSPT), meeting in Fuzhou, called on smelters to jointly reduce production by 2020.
但业内人士向《财经》分析，由于偏低的产能利用率威胁流动性资金流和贷款，各个企业能够承受的底线不一致，联合减产的效果未必理想。
But industry insiders told Caijing that because low capacity utilization threatens liquidity flows and loans, companies can afford inconsistent floors and joint production cuts are not necessarily ideal.
疫情“黑天鹅”的突然出现，客观上“成全”了CSPT的联合减产计划，LME期铜价格下跌带动铜精矿进口价格下滑。
The sudden appearance of the "black swans" objectively completed the joint CSPT production reduction plan, LME copper prices led to a decline in copper concentrate import prices.
“但这种猛烈的被动减产并没有组织性和计划性，会对冶炼企业的现金流带来很多意想不到的问题。
"But this kind of violent passive production reduction is not organized and planned, will bring a lot of unexpected cash flow problems to smelters."
”何笑辉说。
"said Ho.
国际铜矿山供应商也在密切关注中国的行情。
International copper miners are also closely monitoring China's situation.
智利国家铜业公司（Cochilco）表示，将在3月提供有关疫情对智利铜出口影响的首批数据。
Chile's state copper company said it would provide the first data on the impact of the outbreak on Chile's copper exports in March.
Cochilco公共政策负责人Jorge Cantallopts称，将于3月10日左右评估2月份智利矿业出口数据，以了解对当地产业的影响。
Jorge Cantallopts, head of public policy at Cochilco, said that data on Chilean mining exports in February would be assessed around 10 March to see the impact on local industry.
另一大铜生产商的必和必拓（BHP）向《财经》表示，如果终端市场活动能够在4月恢复正常水平，预测2020年中国精炼铜需求增幅将为1.5%左右。
BHP BHP, another big copper producer, told Caijing that demand for refined copper in China is forecast to grow by about 1.5 per cent in 2020 if terminal market activity normalizes in April.
若排除疫情影响的因素，基于矿山供应的平均干扰率，我们对铜市场基本面的预估为铜价将保持在6000~6500美元/吨的区间。
Excluding the impact of the epidemic, and based on the average disturbance rate of the mine supply, our estimate of copper market fundamentals is that copper prices will remain in the range of $6,000 to $6,500 per ton.
疫情给了看涨期铜的投资者巨大打击，截至3月5日收盘，LME铜期货市场价跌至5670.5美元/吨。
The outbreak dealt a big blow to bullish copper investors, whose market price fell to $5670.5 a tonne by the end of March 5.
就在疫情爆发前，LME期铜合约的净多头仓位创下至少两年来的最高水平，部分原因是中美贸易战的阶段性达成一致和中国基建投资政策的明朗化。
Just before the outbreak of the outbreak, the LME copper contract had its highest net long position in at least two years, in part because of a phased agreement on a Sino-American trade war and the clarity of China's infrastructure investment policy.
不过，疫情结束后市场回暖势头仍被一部分投资者看好，“国内的一些铜冶炼企业也认为，行业的回暖会随着疫情落幕而到来。
However, the market recovery after the end of the epidemic is still optimistic by some investors, "some copper smelters in China also believe that the industry warming will end with the epidemic.
