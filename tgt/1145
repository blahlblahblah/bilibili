____武汉这个地方，不南不北，所以他们会有北方人的蛮劲，也会有南方人的精明。
This place _ _ _ _ Wuhan, no south, no north, so they will have the savagery of northerners, but also the shrewdness of southerners.
喜欢过小日子。
Like to live a little life.
而且热爱武汉爱得不由分说，很多武汉人，是不容任何人说武汉一点不好的。
And love Wuhan love can not help but say that many Wuhan people, is not allowed to say Wuhan a little bad.
____记者 | 孔冰欣著名作家方方2月3日起，因新冠肺炎疫情而闭关锁户了一个春节的中国人，其中的一些，已根据实际工作需要，开始陆续恢复上班了。
Fang Bingxin, a famous writer of _ _ _ _, closed his doors to the Chinese New Year because of the outbreak of pneumonia on February 3. Some of them have begun to return to work as needed for practical work.
在当天的一条微博里，长于武汉守在武汉的著名作家方方这样写道：“初十。
In a microblog on that day, the famous writer Fang Fang, who is longer than Wuhan, wrote: "Junior 10.
又一个阳光明亮的日子。
Another sunny day.
昨天以为会继续下雨，但今天却突然晴好。
It was supposed to keep raining yesterday, but it suddenly turned out fine today.
求医的人，或许会因这阳光，多一点温暖。
People who seek medical treatment may get a little warmer from the sun.
”她向一位在一线奋战的医生朋友了解情况，对方抽空告知：一、武汉的医疗用品处于“紧平衡”状态，形势严峻，不能掉以轻心。
"She asked a doctor and friend who was fighting in the field for information. The other side took the time to tell her: First, medical supplies in Wuhan are in a state of" tight balance, "and the situation is serious and cannot be taken lightly.
二、基层政府、社区及村庄隔离措施得力，但仍望各界多多关心，援助基层医院。
Second, the grass-roots government, the community and the village isolation measures are effective, but still hope that the community will pay more attention to the grass-roots hospitals.
三、处理疑似病例，须更妥当，交给社区非长久之计。
Third, the handling of suspected cases must be more appropriate and handed over to the community as a non-permanent solution.
四、所有医院都很忙，确诊和疑似病人人数又与日俱增。
iv. All hospitals are very busy and the number of confirmed and suspected patients is increasing day by day.
五、只有该住院的全部住院，该隔离的全部隔离，疫情才能控制。
V. The outbreak can be controlled only if the inpatient is hospitalized in its entirety and the isolation is complete.
哀民生之多艰，长太息以掩涕。
The life of the poor, too long to cover.
方方感慨，面对那些挣扎、逝去、眼泪，大家都不容易，自己也觉得非常无奈，可转念一想，除了振作起来，还能怎样？我们只得扛住，同时，在有余力兼顾他人的时候，帮着一起扛，无论如何，总要坚持。
Fang fang lamented that in the face of those struggles, passing away, tears, we were not easy, but also felt very helpless, but could think of nothing but cheer up, we had to carry on, and at the same time, help each other when there was time to look after others, and persevere anyway.
幸而，好消息也正传来——火神山医院、雷神山医院开始收治患者；有数据显示，外省病人似已减少，治愈率颇高、死亡率较低……在接受《新民周刊》专访时，方方说，武汉人其实是老实人，很听政府的话，他们爱这座城市，爱得不由分说；“现在，我的心愿就是，生病的人们，都有医院可去。
Fortunately, the good news is coming - the fire god mountain hospital, Lei Shenshan hospital began to treat patients; data show that the provincial patients seem to have decreased, the cure rate is high, the mortality rate is low... In an interview with Xinmin Weekly, Fang Fang said that Wuhan people are honest people and listen to the government.
我为他们祈祷”。
I pray for them.
《新民周刊》：首先是一个最基本、最朴素的问题。
New People's Weekly: First of all, it is a most basic and simple question.
武汉从封城到现在，物资够用吗？（口罩、消毒液、常用药品之类够用否？日常生活还凑合吗？比如买菜什么的）方方：日常生活物质都还是能够保证的。
Does Wuhan have enough supplies from Fengcheng to date? (Mask, disinfectant, commonly used medicines, etc.) Is it enough? Everyday life is OK?
菜价略有上涨，幅度不大。
The price of vegetables rose slightly, not much.
但我觉得这个可以涨。
But I think this can go up.
毕竟天寒地冻又过年，而且还要冒着被感染的危险，涨点也是应该。
After all, the cold weather and the New Year, but also at the risk of infection, also should be the point of rise.
大家对此都没有什么不满。
There is nothing to complain about.
口罩肯定是买不到的，它的需求量太大，并且又是耗材。
Mask is definitely not available. It is in great demand and is a consumable.
只是如果都呆在家里不出门，用的倒也不多。
Only if all stay at home do not go out, use is not much.
像我到现在，一共也只用了两个，第三个还在用。
I've only used two so far, and the third one is still in use.
我没有注意消毒液，我觉得如果家里没有外人来，应该跟平常一样。
I didn't pay attention to the disinfectant. I thought if there were no outsiders coming, it should be the same as usual.
所以，并没有注意。
So, no attention.
药店前一阵一直没开门，现在要求开门了，但不知道情况怎么样。
The drugstore had been closed for some time and now asked to open the door, but I did not know what the situation was.
《新民周刊》：您认为我们完全可以把“隔离”做得更人性化一些？方方：当然。
NEWSWEEK: You think we could have made the "isolation" more humane? Fang Fang: Sure.
比方医院附近都有酒店，过年也没有客人，包下一个酒店，让可疑的病人隔离在那里，组织一个医疗队在酒店巡查，很多轻的感染者，就不用到处跑，以至于又感染到他人了。
For example, there are hotels near the hospital, there are no visitors to the New Year, contract a hotel, isolate suspicious patients, organize a medical team to patrol the hotel, many light infected people, do not have to run around, and then infect others.
这比临时去建一个医院方便快捷得多（同时也可以建医院，并不冲突的）。
This is much easier and quicker than building a hospital on a temporary basis (and it can be built without conflict).
这个建议好像很早就有人提，但一直没有人听。
The suggestion seems to have been made long ago, but nobody has heard it.
当然，或许人家有其他的想法，我是外行，并不知道。
Of course, maybe they have other ideas, I'm a layman, I don't know.
总之，家里只要有一人生病，一旦住不进医院，情况就还是很惨的。
In short, once one member of the family is ill, once in hospital, the situation is still very sad.
有些轻的，因为此故，可能会越来越重，甚至死亡。
Some light, for this reason, may get heavier and heavier, or even die.
《新民周刊》：这个非同寻常的春节，武汉人都成了“咸丰帝”（闲疯）。
New People's Weekly: This unusual Spring Festival, Wuhan people have become "Xianfeng Emperor" (idleness).
那您在家主要做些什么呢？就您所知，身边其他武汉友人们又有哪些苦中作乐的故事？方方：我跟日常差不多。
So far as you know, what other Wuhan friends have to do with their stories? Fang Fang: I'm about the same as usual.
早上肯定是睡觉的。
Must have been sleeping in the morning.
因为写微博，多了一件事。
There's one more thing to do because of microblogging.
然后养狗，给女儿做菜，各方问候一下情况。
Then keep a dog, cook for the daughter, each side greeting the situation.
偶尔去跑步机上跑一小时，其实以前我每天跑一小时，最近跑少了。
I used to run for an hour on the treadmill once in a while, but I've been running less lately.
《新民周刊》：您被建议，不妨写写“封城记”。
NEWSWEEK: You are advised to write "The Book of the Seals."
将来会考虑专门就此话题出书吗？方方：目前没考虑。
Will you consider devoting a book to this topic in the futureFang: Not at the moment.
《新民周刊》：总的来说，武汉人“不信邪”，不认命；任你“万箭穿心”，我自傲然生长。
On the whole, Wuhan people do not believe in evil, do not believe in life; let you "through the heart", I grow proud.
在此次疫情中，一开始有聚餐搞活动的，有跑来跑去的，但后来，绝大多数武汉人还是原地挺住了，体现了这座城市的责任感。
In this outbreak, there was a dinner party at the beginning, some to run around, but later, the vast majority of Wuhan people or the place to stay, reflecting the city's sense of responsibility.
您怎么看武汉人身上那股劲？方方：武汉人其实蛮老实的。
What do you think of the strength in Wuhan? Fang Fang: Wuhan people are actually quite honest.
尽管有一股大大咧咧吊儿郎当的劲，敢说敢骂也敢打，有江湖气，也仗义。
Although there is a carelessness of effort, dare to say dare to scold also dare to fight, there is Jianghuqi, but also justice.
但骨子里是老实人，胆子不算太大。
But underneath he was honest and not too bold.
毫无疑问，他们很听政府的话。
No doubt they listen to the government.
而且热爱武汉爱得不由分说，很多武汉人，是不容任何人说武汉一点不好的。
And love Wuhan love can not help but say that many Wuhan people, is not allowed to say Wuhan a little bad.
他们会跟你闹翻天。
They're gonna mess with you.
也很好玩。
It was fun, too.
武汉这个地方，不南不北，所以他们会有北方人的蛮劲，也会有南方人的精明。
Wuhan, this place, not south not north, so they will have the North of the brute force, there will also be the shrewdness of southerners.
喜欢过小日子。
Like to live a little life.
这一次封城，大概也算是武汉历史继辛亥革命之后最大的一件事吧。
This time around, it is probably the biggest event in Wuhan history after the 1911 Revolution.
