At the time of its giant sensory deprivation experiment, the desire to return to ordinary people has grown.
记录改变中的全球文化图景。
Record the changing global cultural landscape.
这是系列报道的第五篇，发自新疆小城的「个人志」。
This is the fifth in a series of reports, from the "personal history" of a small town in Xinjiang.
17 年前，这座城市曾侥幸躲过「非典」，而 17 年后，在这场「新冠肺炎」疫情面前，乐观幻灭了，人人自危且心痛。
Seventeen years ago, the city narrowly escaped SARS, and 17 years later, optimism died in the face of the New Crown Pneumonia epidemic.
以此为切口，我们想知道，中国人是从这场疫情开始才失去了乐观的能力吗？答案显而易见。
Using this as an incision, do we wonder whether the Chinese have lost their ability to be optimistic since the beginning of the epidemic? The answer is obvious.
这也是疫情发展到现阶段的一个重要影响：人们对日常生活秩序的怀念、对牺牲者命运的共情和对前途的巨大怀疑 —— 这将是一场没有悬念的胜利，但谁也不知道这需要我们每个人支付怎样的代价 —— 一种脱力感正如同病毒般大肆侵袭每一个幸存者的心智。
It is also an important influence at this stage of the epidemic: nostalgia for the order of everyday life, empathy for the fate of the victims, and great doubts about the future - a victory without suspense, but no one knows what it will cost each of us - a sense of detachment that hits the minds of every survivor like a virus.
很难说我们能提供怎样的参考，但我们准备如实记录这样的时刻。
It is difficult to say what reference we can provide, but we are prepared to record such moments as these.
回到这个西北边陲小城后的第一个周末距离除夕恰好还有整整一周时间，市场里的年节气氛正值顶点：行人摩肩接踵，小贩用力招呼。
The first weekend after returning to the western border town was exactly one week from New Year's Eve, and the festival atmosphere in the market was at its height: pedestrians jostled, vendors greeted each other vigorously.
采购年货回家的路上空气湿润，下午天蓝得耀眼。
Buy New Year Goods The air is wet on the way home and the sky is blue in the afternoon.
两个骑马的哈萨克青年从眼前经过 —— 这在西北的城市里也并不常见。
Two Kazakh youths on horseback passed in front of their eyes - something not often seen in northwestern cities.
他们在马背上坐得笔直，蹄声踩在斑马线上，穿过车流，随后双腿急夹马腹，很快消失了。
They sat upright on the horse's back, hooves on the zebra crossing, crossed the stream, then snapped their horses on their stomachs and disappeared quickly.
也正是从那个周末起，有关新型冠状病毒肺炎的报道激增，有亲戚开始在家族群中转发疫情最新动态和防护措施。
It was also from that weekend that reports of a new coronavirus pneumonia surged and relatives began relaying the latest developments and precautions in the family.
也有人持乐观态度，认为这片土地将和 17 年前一样，再次由于偏远而幸运地掠过阴翳。
Others are optimistic that the land, like 17 years ago, will once again be traversed by its remoteness.
小姨一家仍准备按照原计划去西安旅游过年，在她看来是大家有些反应过度了。
The auntie family is still planning to travel to Xi'an for the New Year as planned. She thinks everyone is overreacting.
然而随着疫情的蔓延和对病毒传染性的了解，这种乐观很快幻灭了。
But with the spread of the epidemic and knowledge of the spread of the virus, that optimism quickly evaporated.
1 月 23 日，武汉封城，新疆首次确诊 2 例输入型「新型肺炎」病例，小姨终于在那天决定退票。
On January 23, Wuhan, Xinjiang, the first confirmed two imported "new pneumonia" cases, aunt finally decided to refund the ticket.
除夕那天，家里早早准备好了年夜饭。
On New Year's Eve, dinner was prepared early at home.
春晚开始前，我和父母已经坐在电视机前，各自在微信上认真地编辑拜年问候的信息，希望语言真的具有现实的效力。
Before the Spring Festival Gala began, my parents and I were already sitting in front of the TV set, carefully editing the message of New Year's greetings on our microletters.
零点过后，有人在小区点了一挂两千响，巨大而突兀的鞭炮声过了很久才结束，之后窗外便安静了。
Two thousand rings were fired in the neighborhood after midnight, and the huge and abrupt firecrackers were long gone before the window was quiet.
假期延长了，但父亲还需要去值班，而家里的一次性口罩只剩下十几个。
The leave was extended, but the father had to go on duty and there were only a dozen disposable masks left in the house.
听说城郊一家药店新进了一批口罩，我们决定去碰碰运气。
We heard about a new batch of masks in a suburban pharmacy, and we decided to try our luck.
与负面情绪缠斗久了，任何可能为真的好消息都如同安慰剂，也许无用，却至少能使人稍稍振作精神。
After a long struggle with negative emotions, any good news that might be true is a placebo, perhaps useless, but at least slightly energizing.
然而车开到小区门口才得知，从前一天起，各小区开始限制车辆出入，大门上锁后钥匙统一交由社区管理，只能寄渺茫的希望于附近几家药店。
However, the car to the door to learn that, from the previous day, the small areas began to restrict access to vehicles, locked doors after the key to a unified community management, can only hope to send a few nearby pharmacies.
但正如我们所料，口罩酒精仍是售罄，只有一家表示可以先登记联系方式，到货后发信息通知。
But as we expected, mask alcohol is still sold out, only one can register the contact information, after the delivery of information circulars.
药店外，一辆警车从人行道上迎面缓缓开来，断断续续地向路上步履匆忙的行人喊话，让大家尽快回家不要在街上逗留。
Outside the drugstore, a police car slowly rolled out of the sidewalk and off and on to the hurrying pedestrians, telling everyone to get home as soon as possible and not to linger in the street.
驶过我们时警车停了下来，开车的民警摇下车窗询问情况。
As we passed, the police car stopped and the driver rolled down the window to ask for information.
放倒的副驾驶座上，一个穿着制服的年轻人正在闭目休息。
On the fallen copilot, a young man in uniform was closing his eyes.
母亲被一系列突然措施搞得焦虑起来，急切地想要从一切权威中得到些许可靠消息，于是追问民警交通管制还要持续多久，上班通勤怎么办。
Anxiated by a series of sudden measures, eager to get some reliable information from all the authorities, my mother asked how long police traffic control would last and what about commuting to work.
民警有些无奈，表示他也不清楚，让我们回家等通知。
Police have some helplessness, said he is not clear, let us go home and so on notice.
毫无办法，只能待在家里守着来自疫情前线和各地的最新动态。
There is no choice but to stay at home and watch the latest developments from the front lines of the epidemic and elsewhere.
网络与现实的各个层面不断上演着角力。
Network and the reality of the various levels of constantly performing a struggle.
一边是层出不穷的质疑，另一边是迟缓模糊的回应，个体的声音在其中被裹挟、支配、放大，直到最终被淹没。
On one side are endless questions and on the other are slow, vague responses in which individual voices are held, dominated, magnified, and eventually drowned out.
所谓「真相」或者「说法」似乎可以隐约窥见，但要真正触达则几近一种奢望。
The so-called "truth" or "story" seems to be discernible, but to really reach is almost extravagant.
出离愤怒和担忧惊惧逐渐变成常态体验。
Fear of anger and worry gradually becomes the norm.
恍惚等到再次下楼买菜时才发现，小区大门已经完全封闭，上面贴着附近几家超市和药店的电话。
Trance to wait until the next shopping downstairs only to find that the cell door has been completely closed, above a few nearby supermarkets and pharmacies telephone.
铁门外，一位带着红袖章的社区工作人员拎着喷壶走过，在无人的街道上喷着消毒水。
Outside the iron gate, a community worker with a red armband walks past with a spray bottle and sprays disinfectant on a deserted street.
现在的小区像是在进行一场大型感官剥夺实验，窗外安静得诡异。
The neighborhood now seems to be undergoing a massive sensory deprivation experiment, and the window is eerily quiet.
有时新闻和书看得眼花，便倚在阳台看鸟。
Sometimes the news and books dazzled me, so I leaned on the balcony to watch the birds.
不远处有几户平房，我刚回来的时候，一个正在搭建二层，现在已经停工；另一个不知何时又加高了一层，屋顶的鸽房还在。
There were several bungalows not far off, and on my return one was building a second floor, which was now suspended; the other had been raised a second story at an unknown moment, and the pigeon-house on the roof was still there.
没有鸽哨声，几只鸽子偶尔懒懒地盘旋两下就停在近处的电线上。
There was no sound of pigeons, which occasionally hovered lazily over a nearby wire.
再有就是乌鸦。
Then there are crows.
我家附近有间友谊医院，印象最深的是医院所在的弧形街道两旁年岁长久的垂柳，上面落满了乌鸦。
There is a Friendship Hospital near my home. What impressed me most was the long-standing willows along the arched streets where the hospital was located, covered with crows.
小时候身体病弱，常来问诊，也曾经两次住院。
Childhood ill health, often came to consult with the hospital, but also twice in hospital.
白天，树上的叫声在市井喧闹中并不响亮，但到了晚上，即便只有一只乌鸦张开了它细长的喙，那叫声也能穿透住院部临街的墙壁，让生病的人听得酸涩。
During the day the bark of the tree did not resound loudly in the uproar of the market-place, but at night, even if only one crow opened its slender beak, it could penetrate the street walls of the inpatient department and make the sick man listen sour.
近几年乌鸦活动的范围扩大了，小区上空也经常盘旋着鸦群。
Crows have expanded their range in recent years, and herds often hover over the area.
那些黑色的剪影和叫声，正在傍晚的天空下吸引着人们过剩的注意力。
Those black silhouettes and screams are drawing people's attention to excess under the evening sky.
各种信息仍在不断涌来，其中坏消息似乎有所减少。
Messages are still coming in, and the bad news seems to be waning.
不知是希望真的和春天一起来了，还是头顶的滤网又被密织了几层。
I do not know if I really hope to come with the spring, or the top of the filter network has been woven several layers.
一些基本的价值判断开始动摇甚至失效。
Some basic value judgments are beginning to falter and even fail.
这种感觉糟糕透了，好像溺水或者梦魇，在一片混沌中被一种无形的东西拘压着，使人感到窒息和无力。
It was awful, like drowning or nightmares, trapped in chaos by something invisible, suffocating and powerless.
红色和灰色的惊叹号每在屏幕上出现一次，便又向深渊更深处坠去一些。
Red and grey exclamation marks appeared once on the screen and then went deeper into the abyss.
李文亮医生的逝去让我想起鲸落。
The death of Dr. Liang reminded me of the whale.
在海洋中死去的鲸鱼不断下沉，直至落入数千米深的海底。
Whales that die in the oceans continue to sink until they reach depths of thousands of metres.
在这个漫长的过程中，无数海洋生物渐次赶来接受它馈赠，使它庞大的躯体成为一片在死亡中诞生的绿洲。
During this long process, countless sea creatures have come to accept its gifts, making its huge body an oasis of death.
他终将成为海底的一座沙丘，但他不该也不能被遗忘。
He will become a dune on the bottom of the sea, but he should not and cannot be forgotten.
「使人民彼此完全一样，用同样的训诫与规则支配全体人民的思想与行动 …… 中国人在这方面取得的成功已然超乎于此，然而他们的结果却是如此糟糕 …… 」当我们讨论群己权界时发现，穆勒在一个半世纪以前所言，如今看来仍不免老辣。
"The Chinese have achieved more than that, but the results have been so bad..." When we talk about the world of power, Mill, as he put it a century and a half ago, still looks hot.
无论出于何种考量，即使能够限定人们所相信和表达的内容，也无法阻止思想与情感的产生，对此视而不见或加以掩盖则是无用甚至危险的。
It is useless or even dangerous to turn a blind eye to or conceal the fact that, whatever the considerations, even what one believes and expresses cannot prevent the production of thoughts and feelings.
「国家之败，由官邪也；官之失德，宠赂章也。
"If the state fails, that government will be corrupt; and that bribery will corrupt officials.
」当下个体所能做的非常有限但极其重要 —— 保持良善，坚持思辨，并努力记录。
"What individuals can do now is very limited but extremely important - to be kind, to think, and to keep track of them.
好在我们之中总不乏持续这样做的人。
Fortunately, there are always people among us who continue to do so.
前一段时间，小区每到下午便开始广播，有时用汉语，有时用维吾尔语。
Some time ago, the community began to broadcast every afternoon, sometimes in Chinese, sometimes Uygur language.
我听不懂维吾尔语，于是请教我的一位小学同学 Zakiye。
I could not understand Uighur, so I asked one of my primary school classmates, Zakiye.
她告诉我内容主要是教大家尽量不要出门，外出戴好口罩，每天开窗通风，等等。
She told me that the main content is to teach us not to go out, wear masks, open windows every day, and so on.
Zakiye 就在友谊医院工作，是放疗血液科的一名护士。
Zakiye works in the Friendship Hospital and is a nurse in the radiotherapy unit.
由于交通管制，现在每天步行上下班。
Because of traffic control, people now walk to work every day.
我们不可避免地谈起疫情和医院的情况，她告诉我，目前确诊的病人已在另一家医院集中治疗，友谊医院各个科室正抽调人员分批支援发热门诊，医生护士们都在积极报名。
Inevitably, we talked about the outbreak and the hospital, and she told me that the patients now diagnosed were being treated centrally in another hospital, that the Friendship Hospital departments were deploying staff to support the fever clinic in batches, and that doctors and nurses were actively registering.
维吾尔语中，Zakiye 的意思是「体贴，会照顾人的」，这也是我后来才知道的。
In Uygur, Zakiye means "considerate and caring," as I later learned.
名字这东西真玄，有时是寄托，也是守则，就如同病人每次呼喊的「医生」、「护士」那样，包含了某种希望。
The name is really mysterious, sometimes sustenance, is also a code, like every time the patient shouted "doctor," "nurse," contains a kind of hope.
祝愿他们都能尽快听到自己的名字再次被家人呼唤，重新做回一个普通人。
May they all hear their names called by their families as soon as possible and become ordinary people again.
