从2月7日到现在，一方面大家的活动越来越丰富，另一方面由于轻症患者比较多，人们病情都慢慢恢复。
From February 7 to the present, on the one hand, we have more and more activities, on the other hand, because of the more light patients, people are slowly recovering.
所以，我看到每个人脸上的笑容都变多了。
So, I see everyone with a big smile on their faces.
口述 |余　毅整理 |王仲昀这一个月终于要过去了。
At last, Wang Zhongyun's month has passed.
2月21日上午，在等待几天后，我做了第二次核酸检测。
On the morning of February 21, after waiting for a few days, I had my second nucleic acid test.
前几天做了第一次，检测结果是阴性。
For the first time the other day, the test results were negative.
过两天第二次的结果也会出来，如果还是阴性，加上医生认定我符合标准的话，我就可以出院了。
The second result will come out in two days. If it's negative and the doctor decides I'm up to the standard, I'll be discharged.
从一月下旬开始出现症状，得不到确诊，然后回家隔离。
Symptoms begin in late January, when they are not diagnosed and then go home in isolation.
再到后来病情加重，被确诊，接受治疗，最终来到方舱医院。
Later, the disease became worse, was diagnosed, received treatment, and finally came to the cabin hospital.
过去的一个月，我都在和新冠肺炎作斗争。
For the past month, I've been battling the New Crown Pneumonia.
现在，我终于有一种“胜利”在望的感觉。
Now, I finally have a sense of "victory" in sight.
01进到方舱医院觉得得救了1月底，我出现了新冠肺炎的一些症状，不过始终没被确诊。
01 Into the cabin hospital felt saved at the end of January, I developed some symptoms of pneumonia, but was never diagnosed.
由于症状比较轻，医生建议我回家隔离。
As the symptoms were mild, the doctor advised me to go home and isolate.
一开始我在家有过好转，不过没过几天，到2月份时，病情又突然加重了。
I got better at home at first, but a few days later, in February, it suddenly got worse.
#《口述实录 |我就是那个“疑似”》#眼看在家隔离和吃药没用了，我只好再去医院寻求治疗。
# I was the "suspect" at home. Seeing that isolation and medication were useless, I had to go back to the hospital for treatment.
2月4日，我去了此前已经去过两次的同济医院光谷院区。
On 4 February, I went to Tongji Hospital's Kwanggu compound, which I had visited twice before.
当时我已经浑身畏寒，乏力，头很痛。
I was chilled, tired, and my head ached.
这次去光谷院区，他们终于给我治疗了。
This time to the Gwanggu district, they finally gave me treatment.
没有住院，但是开始在发热门诊给我打针。
No hospitalizations, but started giving me injections at the fever clinic.
余毅的诊断报告单两天之后，我的核酸检测结果出来了，显示是可疑阳性。
Two days after Yu Yi's diagnostic report, my nucleic acid test results came out, showing a suspected positive.
我当时看到检测结果很伤心，胸很闷，呼吸比之前更困难了。
I saw the test results were very sad, chest stuffy, breathing more difficult than before.
我在医院连续打了四天针，到2月7日上午，我接到了东湖疾控中心的电话。
I had four consecutive days of injections in the hospital, and by the morning of February 7 I had a call from the East Lake CDC.
他们说接到我的病情反馈信息，认定我属于阳性和阴性中间的患者，要住院治疗，我说我没床位，他们就让我跟武昌区防疫指挥中心联系，看看能否有床位。
They said they had received feedback from me that I was a positive and negative patient and wanted to be hospitalized. When I said I had no bed, they asked me to contact the anti-epidemic command centre in Wuchang to see if there were beds.
没想到当天晚上，我就接到了电话，说可以安排我去方舱医院。
Unexpectedly, that night, I received a phone call, said that I can arrange to go to the cabin hospital.
于是我直接从家里出发，去了集合点，和其他患者一块被送到了现在所在的武汉客厅方舱医院。
So I set out directly from home, went to the gathering place, and with the other patients were sent to the present Wuhan living room cabin hospital.
当时虽然身体还是不舒服，但跟之前的伤心比起来，我有了一种“得救了”的感觉。
Although I was not feeling well at the time, I felt "saved" compared to my previous sadness.
我在进方舱之前，已经失眠了好几天。
I had been losing sleep for days before I entered the cabin.
02看着大家笑容逐渐变多武汉客厅方舱医院，现在差不多有2000名患者。
Look at all smiles gradually become more and more Wuhan living room square cabin hospital, there are now almost 2,000 patients.
我注意到大部分患者和我差不多，都是那天晚上以及之后两天来的，因为我们这个方舱医院是6号才开放。
I noticed that most of the patients had come about the same night and the next two days, because our cabin hospital was open only on the 6th.
我想说一些我这段时间在方舱的观察。
I'd like to say something about my stay in the cabin.
首先想说，医生护士们真的很辛苦，一开始他们是最忙碌的。
First of all, doctors and nurses are really hard-working. At first they were the busiest.
因为大家都刚来，然后陆续不停有患者进来，一切还不像现在这样有秩序。
Because everyone has just come, and then continue to have patients come in, everything is not as orderly as it is now.
但是，即使在前几天，医护人员依旧保持每天三次来给我们患者测体温、量血压，并且询问我们的身体状况，告诉我们有什么需要都可以跟他们说。
But even in the last few days, paramedics kept taking our patients' body temperature and blood pressure three times a day, asking about our health and telling us what we need to talk to them.
来我们这里的，主要是福建省援鄂医疗队，然后其他地区也有一些。
The medical team from Fujian Province came to us, and then some from other areas.
这些来自全国各地的医护人员，从一开始，就给我们提供了很不错的医疗条件。
These medical personnel from all over the country, from the beginning, provided us with very good medical conditions.
武汉客厅方舱医院的留言墙除了医疗条件，这里的饮食也不错。
Wuhan living room square cabin hospital message wall in addition to medical conditions, here food is also good.
提供给我们的有一日三餐，每一餐的时间也比较固定，早餐是7点，午餐是11点半，晚餐是下午5点半。
We are served three meals a day, with a regular time for each meal. Breakfast at 7: 30, lunch at 11: 30 p.m. and dinner at 5: 30 p.m.
此外还有各种水果和牛奶，有时还有零食。
There are also various kinds of fruit and milk and sometimes snacks.
每天的菜也在换，有各种肉，还有鸡腿。
The food is changing every day, too, with all kinds of meat and drumsticks.
大家都说在这把自己吃胖了。
People say they're getting fat here.
然后生活状况就像人们在网上看到的那样，除了不能洗澡，其他都挺好。
And then living conditions are like what people see on the Internet, except that you can't take a shower, and everything else is fine.
我们进来的时候，这里给每个人发电热毯、牙刷牙膏，还有毛巾。
When we came in, we got everyone a hot blanket, toothbrush toothpaste, and towels.
方舱医院晚上是不熄灯的，所以还给我们发了眼罩。
The cabin hospital didn't turn off the lights at night, so we were given blindfolds.
另外因为空调和换气设备比较多，也发了耳塞，这样睡觉就不会被吵到。
In addition, because the air conditioning and ventilation equipment more, but also issued earplugs, so that sleep will not be noisy.
大家在这里的作息都非常规律，一般晚上10点，大部分人都睡觉了，然后早上六七点起床。
Everyone here is very regular, usually at 10 p.m., most people sleep, and then get up six or seven in the morning.
方舱给每个人发放的眼罩耳塞可能是有了这些生活和医疗上的保障，以及方舱内大多人都是轻症患者，所以在这呆了14天，我能明显感觉到自己和身边的人的变化。
The blindfold earplugs issued by the cabin to everyone were probably due to these life and medical guarantees and the fact that most of the people in the cabin were light patients, so I felt a noticeable change in myself and the people around me for 14 days.
一开始刚来，大家普遍比较焦虑，人和人之间不太愿意交流。
At the beginning, people were generally anxious and reluctant to communicate with each other.
很多人跟我一样，刚进来的时候还要被各种人打电话询问病情，有家人，也有社区的电话。
Many people, like me, are called in by a variety of people, including family members and community phone calls.
这样大家本来心情就不好，还要接电话。
This way, people would be in a bad mood and answer the phone.
我注意到刚来的时候，有些年纪大一点的阿姨，会问医护人员方舱哪里有室外活动场所。
I noticed that when I first arrived, some older aunts would ask the paramedics where there was an outdoor exercise area.
这当然是没有的，但后来我发现她们在厕所外面找到一块地方，那地方不大，但是可以晒太阳。
Of course not, but then I noticed that they found a place outside the toilet, which was small but sunburnt.
有人在天气好的时候会去晒晒太阳，我想这个细节也反映了大家的心情。
Some people go to the sun when the weather is good, and I think this detail also reflects the mood of everyone.
方舱为患者准备的心理自助读本大概从2月10日开始，就有工作人员弄来了音响。
The cabin psychological self-help book for patients started around February 10, and the staff got the stereo.
有了音响，人们就闲不住了。
With the sound system, people can't help but be idle.
唱歌、跳广场舞都有了，还有护士带着我们跳一些健身操。
There are singing, dancing in the square, and nurses taking us to do some fitness exercises.
我基本上每天都跟着跳健身操。
I basically do aerobics every day.
有了这些活动，人们也就开朗起来了，大家的交流逐渐变多。
As a result of these activities, people began to open up and their exchanges became more and more frequent.
我身边睡的都是三四十岁的人，大家也挺谈得来，这段时间相处下来，让人感到也是比较温暖。
I sleep around people in their thirties and forties, we also talk quite well, this time together, people feel warm.
从2月7日到现在，一方面大家的活动越来越丰富，另一方面由于轻症患者比较多，人们病情都慢慢恢复。
From February 7 to the present, on the one hand, we have more and more activities, on the other hand, because of the more light patients, people are slowly recovering.
所以，我看到每个人脸上的笑容都变多了。
So, I see everyone with a big smile on their faces.
Play除了我们这些患者之间的交流变多，我们和医护人员也聊得越来越多。
Play Apart from the increased interaction between us, we talked to healthcare professionals more and more.
我们发现，医护人员不仅要给我们提供各种测试，还得给我们送饭。
We found that the paramedics not only provided us with various tests, but also delivered food to us.
然后有一些像我这样症状随着时间几乎消失的患者，从18日前后就自发组织起来，当起了志愿者。
Then there were patients like me, whose symptoms almost disappeared over time, who spontaneously organized themselves around the age of 18 as volunteers.
其实我们能做的也只有帮他们分发患者的食物，但是他们还是一直跟我们表达感谢。
The only thing we can do is distribute the food to them, but they still thank us all the time.
我觉得在这种时候，帮助别人也让我自己更快乐，比我天天躺在床上更舒服。
I feel that helping others at times like this makes me happier, more comfortable in bed than I am every day.
轻症患者组织的志愿者招募我已经做完了两次核酸检测，现在身体也没什么异样，我想离我从方舱出院的日子不远了。
I have completed two nucleic acid tests and I am not in a bad condition. I think it is not long before I am discharged from the capsule.
我还没想好之后的打算，因为我出去之后还得按要求去社区安排的酒店，再隔离14天。
I haven't made up my mind yet, because I'll have to go to a community hotel when I'm out for another 14 days.
我老婆和孩子也都在隔离点。
My wife and kids are in quarantine, too.
家人相见可能还有一段日子，我希望那一天能尽快到来。
It may be some time before my family meets, and I hope that day will come soon.
