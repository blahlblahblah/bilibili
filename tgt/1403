本文是协作者在“农民工抗疫救援行动”中，针对困境农民工家庭开展的个案访谈之一，旨在快速识别疫情中的脆弱人群及其需求，为疫情防控和救援工作提供参考，我们整理出来与你分享。
This article is one of the case interviews conducted by the co-authors in the "Anti-epidemic Rescue Operation for Migrant Workers," which aims to identify the vulnerable people and their needs in the epidemic quickly, and to provide reference for prevention, control and rescue work.
疫情下的深呼吸——困境农民工家庭个案实录（之一）我扛着这个家，尽力过一天算一天口述者：刘霞（化名）/安徽籍打工所在地：北京编者注：刘霞， 44岁，没上过学，2015年带着患有肾病综合症的小儿子到北京求医。
I carry the family and try to live a day by day oral: Liu Xia (not her real name) / Anhui working place: Beijing Editor's Note: Liu Xia, 44 years old, did not attend school, and in 2015 brought her young son with nephrotic syndrome to Beijing for medical treatment.
刘霞的丈夫打着多份工作支撑家庭，积劳成疾，在去年9月突然发现肝癌晚期，于12月9日去世。
Liu Xia's husband, who worked a lot to support his family and became ill, suddenly discovered late liver cancer in September and died on December 9.
年前，刘霞在老家处理完丈夫的后事就回到了北京。
Liu Xia returned to Beijing after handling her husband's affairs in her hometown some years ago.
此时，疫情开始爆发。
At this point, the outbreak began.
刘霞说，即使再难，她也得扛起这个家。
Liu Xia said she had to carry the family, even if it was difficult.
现在是哪个事更急就先做哪个事，走一步算一步我老公之前没夜没白的上班，就这么突然倒下去了。
Now which thing is more urgent to do first, step by step calculation My husband before the night did not work in vain, so suddenly fell down.
2019年9月，我们去检查时，我老公已经是肝癌晚期，医生说“怎么治也没用”。
When we went for an examination in September 2019, my husband was already in the advanced stages of liver cancer and the doctor said "it doesn't help how to treat it."
从2019年9月5日之后，我老公一直在老家的医院住院治病，2019年12月9日他就走了。
Since 5 September 2019, my husband has been hospitalized in his home hospital and left on 9 December 2019.
我公公婆婆身体不好，白发人送黑发人，让他们更受打击，现在只能走一步算一步。
My father-in-law is not in good health, the gray-haired give black hair, let them suffer more, now can only walk step by step.
我也是2019年查出来有二型糖尿病，还有甲减，家里也没有血糖仪、血压计。
I was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2019, as well as a reduction, there is no blood sugar meter, sphygmomanometer.
我每周六去家附近的大药房免费测一次血糖，但人家只有周六早上才是免费测。
I go to the big drugstore near my house every Saturday for a free blood sugar test, but only on Saturday mornings.
我也喝过中药，没喝几次，太贵了，买一次药就要花八九百元钱。
I also drank Chinese medicine, did not drink several times, too expensive, to buy a medicine will cost 8900 yuan.
那时我老公一边住院，我就一边喝中药，真是喝不起，就停了。
At that time my husband was hospitalized, I was drinking Chinese medicine, really can not afford to drink, stopped.
现在每天吃西药，二甲双胍降糖药、甲减的药，都是到药店去自己买，能比医院开的便宜点，可每月也得花几百块。
Now, take metformin daily, metformin sugar-lowering drugs, meta-reductive drugs, are to go to the pharmacy to buy their own cheaper than the hospital can be a few hundred dollars a month.
小儿子越越是两岁多的时候查出来患有肾病综合征，那时候是2010年，先是去了蚌埠、合肥……到处去看。
The younger son was more than two years old when found to have nephrotic syndrome, in 2010, first to Bengbu, Hefei... to see everywhere.
后来2015年来到北京，就一直在这看。
I came to Beijing in 2015 and I've been watching it.
本来想着看完病就回安徽老家，但后来越越必须得一个月去一次医院做检查。
I wanted to go back to my hometown of Anhui after the illness, but I had to go to the hospital once a month to have a check-up.
看了那么多医院，只有北京能治他的病，西药也吃过，对他没效果，我们不待在北京不行，就这么一晃有四年多的时间了。
After seeing so many hospitals, only Beijing can cure his illness, western medicine has been eaten, it has no effect on him, we can not stay in Beijing, just like this for more than four years.
家里人说在北京开销大，我也感觉在这儿生活不起，可有什么办法啊。
My family said it was expensive in Beijing, and I feel I can't afford to live here. What can I do?
每月挂号看病、拿药得2000多元，病友介绍给我们在私人诊所买中药，虽然报销不了，但是效果感觉还可以。
Every month registered to see a doctor, take medicine more than 2000, the patient introduced us to buy Chinese medicine in private clinics, although the reimbursement can not be reimbursed, but the effect of feeling OK.
儿子看病这么多年花了五六十万，一天到晚跑来跑去给儿子看病，吃饭都困难，他得这个病已经十来年。
It had been ten years since he had been ill, and he had spent five or six hundred thousand years in the service of his son, who had been in trouble all day and all day.
后来我老公患肝癌，网络众筹给我丈夫筹了5万元，帮了我们一个大忙，协作者你们还协助我们转发了。
Later my husband had liver cancer, the network to raise 50,000 yuan for my husband, helped us a big favor, you also helped us forward.
我们全家有新农合，但新农合是2019年7月才开始的，而且只有住院的花费才能报销，孩子门诊开药不能报销。
Our family has a New Rural Cooperative, but the NRCM started only in July 2019 and can only be reimbursed for hospital expenses and not for outpatient medication for children.
现在是哪个事更急就先做哪个事，希望可以先把儿子的病治好。
Now which thing is more urgent to do which thing first, hope to be able to cure the son's illness first.
▲楼房夹缝中，刘霞的家（摄于2017年12月9日）经历的事太多了，感觉生死没有多重要2019年底，我们在老家给我老公烧完纸，就回北京了，路上没经过武汉那边。
Between the cracks, Liu Xia's home (photographed on December 9, 2017) went through too much, feeling that life and death is not very important at the end of 2019, we gave my husband burning paper back home, on the way back to Beijing, the road did not pass Wuhan.
过年期间我们一直在北京，没出去。
We stayed in Beijing during the New Year.
年前没有听说这个病毒（新型冠状病毒肺炎），就是过年这几天才听说的这个病，从电视和手机上看的。
The virus (new coronavirus pneumonia) was not heard of until the past few days, from the TV and mobile phone to see the disease.
我们每天早起通风，有时点艾条，但不清楚点艾条是不是有作用。
We get up early and have a nice day. Sometimes we order a stripe, but we don't know if it helps.
我也不知道是飞沫传播，就看着说要戴口罩，不知道还得戴眼镜、护目镜。
I also do not know is the droplet spread, looked at want to wear a mask, do not know have to wear glasses, goggles.
我们租房这块的居委会有人来在门口给我们消毒，都宣传让人在家待着别去人多的地方，别串门。
We rent this section of the neighborhood committee came to the door to disinfect us, are promoting people stay at home do not go to many places, do not visit.
三女儿是回老家跟她奶奶过年去了，我们老家农村村口也封了，不让走亲戚。
The third daughter is back home with her grandmother to celebrate the New Year, our hometown also closed the rural village, not to let relatives.
家里人没什么文化，但村里干部拿大喇叭吆喝，都不让串门，我们听村里的不出门。
The family had no education, but the village cadres shouted at the loudspeaker and refused to let the villagers stay in the house.
我儿子身体不好，家里就没断过从药店买的一次性医用口罩，还剩20个，酒精消毒液没有。
My son is not in good health, the family has never stopped buying disposable medical masks from pharmacies, there are 20 left, no alcohol disinfectant.
我们年前没买多少菜，那时候不知道疫情，知道就多买点放着了。
We did not buy many dishes years ago, then did not know the epidemic situation, know to buy some more.
这几天菜价突然涨价很贵，买一点点就花了好几十块，那天我买一小块冬瓜、一根芹菜、一个莴笋，就花了30多元，现在一颗大白菜20多元，太贵了。
The price of vegetables these days is very expensive, buy a little on the dozens of dollars, that day I bought a small piece of winter melon, celery, a lettuce, spent more than 30, now a cabbage more than 20, too expensive.
非典时我们在老家，当时也不知道非典具体是怎么回事，就不出门就过去了。
SARS when we are in the home, then do not know how SARS is specific how to go, do not go out on the past.
这次的病毒我觉得，这个事又不是只针对一个人，大家都是一样的，贵了我们就少吃一点。
This virus I think, this matter is not only aimed at one person, everyone is the same, expensive we eat less.
这么多年，我们家经历的事情太多了，感觉生死没有多重要，过一天是一天吧。
After all these years, our family has gone through so many things that it doesn't matter much whether we live or die.
他爸这一走，家里就剩下大女儿一个人挣钱，每个月3500元。
When his father left, the older daughter was left to earn money alone, at 3500 yuan a month.
我就是感觉大女儿好像是一下子长大一些了，知道关心我、安慰我。
I just feel that the eldest daughter seems to grow up a little bit, know to care about me, comfort me.
她23岁了，有时就叫她回家订亲什么的，她就说不订。
She was 23, and sometimes asked her to go home and make an appointment, and she said no.
她还说，如果有人要跟她订亲的话，她说要跟人家说“我要多陪我妈几年再出嫁可以不可以？可以的话就订，不可以就不订”。
If someone asks her to marry her, she says she wants to say, "Can I stay with my mom for a few more years before tying the knot? If I can, I can't."
她打工的地方是1月20号放的假，放假了就手机上投简历想找临时的工作，西单有卖衣服的给她联系叫她过去，她就去了。
Her place of work is January 20 on the holiday, on the mobile phone to send resumes to find temporary jobs, Xidan has to sell clothes to her call her to call her, she went.
她20号就去上班了，一直到现在还没有休息一天。
She went to work on the 20th and has not had a day off.
我眼下最难的是找工作可能不太好找，老乡亲戚也没有能介绍工作的。
The hardest thing for me right now is that finding a job may not be easy, and my folks can't get a job.
主要是我要照顾孩子，给他做饭要求比较高，医生让特别注意，很多工作我不能及时回来（做饭）的话就做不了。
Mainly I have to take care of the children, give him a higher cooking requirements, the doctor to pay special attention to a lot of work I can not do (cooking) in time.
比如人家很多保洁都是7点要到岗，但是我还得送儿子上学，还得给他喝一碗中药，晚上也不能回来太晚，还得给他做饭。
I have to send my son to school. I have to give him a bowl of Chinese medicine. I can't come back too late at night.
像家政市场要求住家的保姆多，我又不能住家。
Home-help markets require more live-in nannies, and I can't live at home.
我只能找8:30之后上的班，人家哪能都给你这么卡点，都是哪有活儿你能在规定时间去才介绍活儿给你。
I can only look for 8: 30 after the shift, people can give you so many hours, where is the work you can only introduce the work to you at the scheduled time.
现在发生疫情了，别人家里也更不敢雇保姆。
Now that the epidemic is under way, other families are less likely to hire nannies.
不把这个病“打”下去就不稳当，有人说等过了正月十五就好，有人说三四个月才行，我们不懂，也不知道什么时候才能完。
Do not "hit" the disease is not stable, some people said waiting for the fifteenth day of the first month, some say three or four months, we do not understand, do not know when to finish.
▲协作者社会工作者（右）探访刘霞家（摄于2017年12月9日）以后还得留在北京给儿子看病……我只能说是尽力越越今年12岁了，放假这些天，天天在家都不学习，就是玩，你没听我刚才还跟他吵嘛，学校也留了寒假作业，他就好像跟学习没缘分，这学期期末数学考了50多分，也不知道他是学不进去还是底子差，就是不开窍。
Co-author social worker (right) to visit Liu Xia family (December 9, 2017) after the visit to see his son in Beijing... I can only say that the 12 years of this year, holiday, home do not study, just play, you did not listen to me just now with him, school winter homework, he did not know whether he is learning or bad, or not.
医生说这个病的事对他也有影响，大脑吃了这么多药吃的有点记忆不好了。
The doctor said the illness also had an effect on him, the brain took so many drugs to eat a little bad memory.
有时我问越越，长大了你想干什么？他说不知道。
Sometimes I ask more and more, what do you want to do when you grow up? He says he doesn't know.
他一天到晚就看电视，听小说，听那个神医什么的小说，四大名著的那些他不喜欢，有时他还说，“妈，我爸要是碰上这个神医就可以看好了！”还说“妈，不知道为什么，那时候我爸生病，你跟我爸回老家，我跟我姐在北京，我姐晚上8、9点才回家，就我一个人在家待着，我越想越难受，越想越想哭，干脆就不想了，就装个傻子，谁问我什么我就哈哈哈大笑”。
He watches TV all day long, listens to novels, listens to that theologian or something, doesn't like it, and sometimes says, "Mom, my father was sick, you and my father were back home, my sister and I were in Beijing, and my sister came home at 8 or 9 pm.
我也感觉他有时候在装，他爸走了，不可能不难受。
I also felt like he was pretending, his father was gone, and it was impossible not to feel bad.
后来我也觉得他懂事听话了一点，虽然嘴上说的“不、不、不”，跟我犟嘴，但是还是照我说的去做了。
Later I also think he is a bit obedient, although the words "no, no, no", and I contradict me, but I do do.
现在我让他去倒垃圾，他说“为什么光要我倒？为什么叫我拿？”我说因为咱家就你是男人，就得你照顾妈了。
Now I asked him to take out the garbage, and he said, "Why do you want me to pour it out? Why should I take it?" I said that because you were the only man in the house, you had to take care of Mom.
有时我说，拿笤帚把地扫扫，他也拿起来就扫了。
Sometimes I say, Take a broom and sweep the ground, And he picks it up and clears it.
他爸刚查出来这个毛病时，我一下子接受不了，吃不下，睡不着的。
As soon as his father found out about it, I couldn't take it, I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep.
他说：“妈你这样不吃不喝不睡，我爸已经住院都这样了，你要再倒下了，我们怎么办啊？”，我说：“我听了你这句话我心里真高兴，因为我家儿子长大了，知道劝他妈了”。
He said, "Mom, you don't eat, you don't sleep, my father's in hospital, you're going down again, what do we do?" I said, "I'm so glad to hear that because my son grew up and knew how to tell his mother.
有时候也伤心，但是再伤心也伤心不回来了。
Sometimes sad, but no matter how sad will not come back.
我们以后还得留在北京给儿子看病，最近确实是比以前更困难一点了，我再怎么坚强，也没有一个男人肩膀硬，我只能说是尽力。
We will have to stay in Beijing to see my son, recently is indeed a little more difficult than before, I no matter how strong, not a man shoulder hard, I can only say is trying.
社会工作者手记访谈中，感受到越越妈妈还沉浸在哀伤中。
Social workers in the manual interview, feel more and more mother is still immersed in grief.
丈夫的突然病逝，对这个已经压力重重的家庭无疑是飞来横祸。
The husband's sudden death was a disaster for an already stressed family.
她眼中那个饱受疾病折磨的小儿子，虽然对于学习和未来仍有很多迷茫，但是也和女儿一样在磨难中开始长大。
Her sick little son, though still confused about his studies and future, began to grow up, just like her daughter.
疫情之下，刘霞依然得在生活和求医的路上坚持走下去。
