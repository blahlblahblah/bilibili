在2月19日晚播出的《新闻1+1》节目中，白岩松时隔14天再次连线中国工程院副院长、呼吸与危重症医学专家王辰。
In "News 1 + 1" broadcast on the evening of February 19, Bai Yansong was reconnected to Wang Chen, Vice-President of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and a specialist in respiratory and critical medicine.
14天过去了，武汉到底有多少病人？摸排出来了吗？床位现在够不够？治疗上是否有新的突破？针对武汉的疫情，王辰再次进行解答。
Fourteen days have passed, Wuhan after all how many patients? Feel out? Is the bed now enough? Is there a new breakthrough in treatment? In Wuhan, Wang Chen again answer.
一、14天过去了，感到高兴的变化是什么？王辰：由于床位的增加，“应收尽收”战略目标正在一步一步实现。
One, 14 days has passed, what is the happy change? Wang Chen: Due to the increase of beds, the strategic goal of "Receivable Collection" is being realized step by step.
二、担心的是什么？王辰：病人收治比较晚，收治之前可能已经传染他人。
What are you worried aboutWangchen: Patients are admitted to hospital relatively late, and may have infected others before admission.
这个问题不解决，不利于控制疫情传播。
This problem will not be solved to control the spread of the epidemic.
除了“应收尽收”，“应收早收”很关键。
In addition to "receivable", "receivable early collection" is crucial.
三、武汉到底有多少病人？摸排出来了吗？王辰：摸排很重要，目前已经摸排九成以上。
How many patients are there in Wuhan? Wangchen: It's very important to map out the number of patients in Wuhan.
但具体有多少病人还不太清楚，而每天确诊的病例是实实在在的。
But the exact number of patients is unclear, and the number of cases diagnosed each day is real.
四、武汉床位供给够了吗？王辰：我觉得现在床位的问题很大幅度解决了。
Is the supply of beds in Wuhan enough? Wang Chen: I think the problem of beds has been solved a lot.
方舱医院到20日将有三万张床位，其他定点医院也达到两万张左右。
The hospital will have 30,000 beds by the 20th, and other designated hospitals will reach about 20,000 beds.
但现在的问题是，这些床位是不是能够及时用上。
But the question now is whether the beds will be available in time.
比如，现在收治病人的时间还相对较长，需要尽早收治。
For example, patients are now admitted for a relatively long period of time, requiring early treatment.
这需要规范流程，而这个流程或许还需要摸索。
This requires standardizing the process, which may have to be groped for.
五、武汉危重症病人占病人的比重降到18%，什么原因？王辰：最主要的原因是收治的病人总量多了，分母变大了。
The proportion of critically ill patients in Wuhan has dropped to 18% .What's the reason? Wang Chen: The main reason is that the total number of patients admitted to Wuhan has increased.
六、现在可利用的手段和药物是否明显增多？王辰：有所增多，但也还在探索阶段。
Is there a noticeable increase in the means and drugs available? Wang Chen: There has been an increase, but it is still in the exploratory stage.
因为这个病是一个新出现的疾病，对它的规律还不了解，此前是基于过去的一些经验现制订的一些治疗方法。
Because the disease is a new one, the laws of the disease are not known, until now based on some past experience developed some treatment methods.
随着对病情规律的认识，我们的治疗针对性越来越强、越来越规范，但我们的认识还非常粗浅，包括对新药、新疗法的探索都还在初级阶段。
With the understanding of the law of the disease, our treatment more and more targeted, but our understanding is still very shallow, including the new drugs, new therapies are still in the initial stage.
大家知道医学是个非常复杂的过程，对于一个新药和新疗法绝对不是简单能够一蹴而就的。
It is well known that medicine is a very complex process and that new drugs and treatments are by no means easy to achieve overnight.
在这个时候，我们既要有急迫的心情，感受到病人急迫的需要，同时要有非常清晰的头脑、非常稳健的行动，这样才能推动科学研究。
At this time, we have to have a sense of urgency, the urgent needs of patients, but also have a very clear mind, very steady action, so as to promote scientific research.
在这个过程中，我要特别提示的就是一定要尊重科学程序。
In this process, I would particularly like to remind you of the need to respect scientific procedures.
七、方舱医院轻症转成重症的比例高吗？王辰：我做了一个调研，这个比例在2%-5%左右，这或许也跟方舱医院里有一些存量、病人发病时间比较长有一定关系。
Wangchen: I have done a survey and the proportion is about 2% -5%, which may also be related to the long time that there are some stocks and patients in the cabin hospital.
另外，在方舱医院有效规范的治疗之下，一旦有重症病人，会及时转到正规医院去，流程比从家里转病人要通畅很多，能够帮助病人得到规范及时的治疗。
In addition, under the effective and standardized treatment of the Fang Cao Hospital, patients with severe illnesses will be referred to the regular hospital in a timely manner, and the process will be much more smooth than the transfer of patients from home, helping patients to receive regular and timely treatment.
八、方舱医院里的广场舞是否有积极作用？王辰：这个病本身特点就是目前大部分都是轻症病人。
Do the square dances in the square cabin hospital have a positive effect? Wang Chen: The disease itself is characterized by the fact that most of the patients are now mild.
方舱医院病人是轻症病人，从体力上、心态上都能够进行一些社会活动和交往。
The patient in the Fang Cao Hospital is a mild-disease patient, who can carry out some social activities and interactions physically and mentally.
在方舱医院里组织一些人文活动，对于舒缓病人紧张情绪、提高生活状态和质量是非常有帮助的，对病情也有帮助。
The organization of some humane activities in the cabin hospital is very helpful in easing the tension and improving the living conditions and quality of life of the patients.
九、钟南山说武汉还存在人传人，在武汉阻断人传人还需要做什么？王辰：这个病能够人传人，是由病毒的生物学规律所决定的。
9, Zhong Nan Shan said Wuhan there are still human-to-human, in Wuhan to block human-to-human-to-do What needs to be done? Wang Chen: This disease can be passed from person to person, determined by the biological laws of the virus.
阻断人传人，就要让它不具备人传人的条件，也就是说把传染源隔离起来，把传播途径切断。
Blocking human-to-human transmission requires that it not have the human-to-human condition, that is to say, isolate the source of infection and cut off the transmission route.
这也是我们过去采取一系列措施，比如封闭小区、收治和隔离患者等的原因，用这些措施防止交叉感染。
This is why we have taken a series of measures in the past, such as closing communities, treating and isolating patients, and using them to prevent cross-infection.
十、无症状感染者怎么发现？怎么治疗？王辰：对无症状感染者的判断主要是靠核酸检测，以后还会有抗原检测、抗体检测，这些检测方法是甄别无症状感染者有效的手段。
How to treat asymptomatic infectionWang Chen: The diagnosis of asymptomatic infection is mainly based on nucleic acid testing, and there will be antigen testing, antibody testing, these methods are effective means to identify asymptomatic infected people.
新冠病毒或许也会发生一定变化。
The new crown virus may change somewhat, too.
针对它所反映出来的生物学特点，我们随着认识加深，会对应制订一些医学上的防范和诊断治疗方法，并做出相应的安排和预防。
In view of the biological characteristics it reflects, we will formulate some preventive and diagnostic methods and make corresponding arrangements and prevention as we know more about them.
十一、第六版诊疗方案中也明确提到了气溶胶传播，如何防范？王辰：气溶胶是在一定空间内传播，所以通风至关重要，人和人之间不要太密集，保持一定的距离至关重要。
The sixth edition of the diagnostic and treatment plan also explicitly mentioned aerosol transmission, how to prevent? Wang Chen: Aerosols are spread in a certain space, so ventilation is important, not too dense between people, to maintain a certain distance is essential.
另外，跟风向的上下风口也有关系。
In addition, with the wind up and down the wind outlet is also related.
十二、拐点来了吗？王辰：我们感觉到现在发病的趋势在放缓。
Has the inflection point come? Wang Chen: We feel that the trend of illness is slowing down.
总体来说，拐点是否到来取决如何定义拐点。
Overall, whether the inflection point comes depends on how the inflection point is defined.
一定要基于疾病本身的规律和基于这个规律之上，我们所采取的社会动员和一系列防控、干预措施的综合影响，拐点是一个因变量，我们控制好它的若干自变量才是重要的。
The inflection point is a dependent variable, and it is important that we control some of its independent variables, based on and based on the laws of the disease itself and the combined impact of our social mobilization and a range of prevention and control measures.
十三、新冠病毒可能跟我们长期共存吗？王辰：新冠肺炎与SARS不同。
xiii. Is the new crown virus likely to co-exist with us for a long timeWang Chen: Newly crowned Pneumonia is different from SARS.
SARS传播性和致病性都很强，很快把宿主杀死然后病毒自身也不容易存活。
SARS is both contagious and pathogenic, killing the host quickly and making it difficult for the virus itself to survive.
而新冠肺炎有可能转成慢性疾病，像流感一样与人类共存。
But the new crown pneumonia has the potential to turn into a chronic disease that coexists with humans like the flu.
对此，我们从临床诊治和生产生活防范方面都要做好相应准备。
In this regard, we should be prepared from the clinical diagnosis and treatment and life prevention aspects of production.
十四、病人痊愈之后，损伤的肺部能完全恢复吗？王辰：我们有限的观察提示它能恢复，甚至完全恢复，但这还有待更进一步、更长期的观察，我想大家不必过于担心。
After the patient recovers, will the damaged lungs recover completely? Wang Chen: Our limited observations suggest that it will recover, or even completely, but this needs to be looked at further and over the longer term, so I don't think you should worry too much.
