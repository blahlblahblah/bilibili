兴城海滨三礁揽胜 图片来源：图虫记者：张馨予编辑：周卓然“ 许多行业面临着复工难题，但兴城的泳装厂工人早已到位，只是他们生产的泳装没有人买。
2007-9-25 21: 48 "Many industries are struggling to get back to work, but Xingcheng's swimwear factory workers are already in place, but none of their swimwear has been bought.
”自2月27日复工以来，潘丽所在的兴城贝迪斯泳装厂就开始了“盲目生产”。
Since resuming work on February 27, Panli's Xingcheng Beidis swimsuit factory has been engaged in "blind production."
这段时间，贝迪斯的工人们每天加工价值10万余元的1000多件泳装，再全部放进仓库，因为一天最多只能卖出十几、二十件。
During this time, Bedis workers processed more than 1,000 swimsuits worth more than 100,000 yuan a day and put them all into the warehouse because they could sell only a dozen or so pieces a day.
往年这个时候，规模中等的贝迪斯和兴城大大小小的泳装厂一样，刚刚备战完年后的第一个销售小高峰三八节，几乎生产多少就能卖多少。
At this time of year, the average-sized Bettis and Xingcheng swimwear factories can sell as much as they can produce, just as they prepare for the first sales peak of the year.
机器持续轰鸣，等待着着五一旺季的来临。
Machines continue to roar, waiting for the May Day season to arrive.
兴城隶属于辽宁省葫芦岛市，当地泳装行业从1980年代中期便开始萌芽，如今兴城生产了全球四分之一的泳装，几乎每个兴城人都至少有一位从事泳装行业的亲戚。
Xingcheng belongs to Huludao City, Liaoning Province. The local bathing suit industry has been sprouting since the mid-1980s. It now produces a quarter of the world's swimwear. Almost every Xingcheng person has at least one relative in the swimsuit industry.
兴城市泳装协会的数据显示，2018年底兴城共有泳装生产企业1200余家，从业人员6万余人。
According to the Xingcheng Swimsuit Association, by the end of 2018 Xingcheng has more than 1,200 swimwear production enterprises, employing more than 60,000 people.
新冠肺炎疫情的爆发，让这座泳装之城突然停滞了下来。
The outbreak of the New Crown Pneumonia brought the swimsuit city to a sudden halt.
兴城海滨旅游景区 拍摄：张馨予工人早已到位，但生产的泳装没有人买疫情以来，许多企业头痛的问题是工人无法及时到位，以及供应链环节无法全面复工，但兴城泳装企业并没有遭遇这些难题。
Xingcheng seaside tourist attractions: Zhang Yingyu workers have been in place, but since no one bought the swimwear epidemic, many companies have had trouble getting workers in place in time and the supply chain can't get back to work, but Xingcheng swimwear companies have not encountered these difficulties.
兴城泳装厂的工人基本都是本地人，30多年的积累让兴城拥有相对完整的产业链，胸垫、松紧带、里衬等各种辅料工厂都很齐备，因此复工并不难。
Xingcheng swimwear factory workers are basically local people, more than 30 years of accumulation of Xingcheng has a relatively complete industrial chain, chest cushion, elastic belt, lining and other accessories factories are well prepared, so it is not difficult to resume work.
贝迪斯用4元1只的价格买了5000只口罩，让工厂里的约140名工人分批上工，每天35名工人乘班车来到车间，工作时每人保持1.5米的间隔，这就能开工了。
Biddes bought 5,000 masks for $4 a unit, had about 140 factory workers work in batches, and 35 workers took buses to the workshop every day to work at 1.5-metre intervals so that work could begin.
真正让兴城泳装企业头痛的，是疫情期间全国范围内几乎都没有人度假、游泳和泡温泉了，这意味着全国对泳装的需求几乎下降为零。
What really bothers Xingcheng swimwear companies is that few people around the country took vacations, swam or spas during the epidemic, meaning the nation's demand for swimwear fell to almost zero.
贝迪斯是专门做内单的泳装厂，生产的货品全部面向国内，近两个月以来销售额几乎暴跌100%。
Biddes is a specialized bathing suit factory that produces goods all over the country, with sales down almost 100% in the past two months.
工人都到位了，只是生产的泳装没有人买。
All the workers were in place, but none of the swimsuits were bought.
尽管如此，工人的工资需要照常发放，潘丽说工厂一个月的损失至少60万元。
Still, workers' wages need to be paid as usual, and Ms. Pan says the factory loses at least 600, 000 yuan a month.
赵阳也经营着一家以内单为主的泳装企业湘雨婷，疫情以来国内订单全都被砍。
Zhao Yang is also operating a single within the main swimwear enterprises Xiangyuting, since the outbreak of domestic orders have all been cut.
“都说餐饮业难，我们也难。
"It's difficult to say the restaurant business, and so are we.
餐饮业还能做外卖，我们什么都做不了，因为人们不旅游、不游泳，我们就基本没销路了。
The restaurant industry can still do take-out, and we can do nothing because we can't sell much unless people travel and swim.
”过年前，赵阳为了将来的旺季生产备了100多万元的原料，如今货都堆在仓库，现金流开始吃紧。
Before the New Year, Zhao Yang produced more than one million yuan of raw materials for the coming season, and now goods are piled in warehouses, with cash flow tight.
为了响应复工复产，也为了让工厂正常运作，赵阳想办法接了一些外贸加工单。
In response to the resumption of production, but also in order to allow the normal operation of the factory, Zhao Yang thought of ways to receive some foreign trade processing orders.
目前，整个兴城几乎只有专门做欧美外贸的泳装厂还能接到订单，日韩订单都在急剧减少，这与疫情在当地的严重程度紧密相关。
Currently, almost all Xingcheng swimwear factories specializing in European and American foreign trade are still receiving orders, and orders from Japan and South Korea are falling sharply, which is closely related to the severity of the epidemic on the ground.
但新接的订单几乎不能为赵阳的工厂带来收入，因为外贸单基本只需要加工，而赵阳还雇佣了设计、打版等工资较高的员工，一般做外贸的工厂没有这些开销。
But the new orders barely generate revenue for Zhao's factories, because foreign trade orders require little more than processing, while Zhao Yang employs better-paid workers such as designers and printers, which are not usually found in factories that do foreign trade.
开工到现在，赵阳工厂的亏损在10万元左右。
Up to now, Zhaoyang factory's loss of about 100,000 yuan.
除了中等规模的工厂，兴城还有大量员工小于20人的小型工厂，这些基本是厂子后面就是住家的“家庭作坊”。
In addition to medium-sized factories, Xingcheng also has a large number of small factories with fewer than 20 employees.
刘姿岑家的小型工厂平时主要接国内和日韩的订单，如今开工不到一个星期，工厂订单量不及去年同期的十分之一。
Mr. Liu's small factories, which typically take orders from China and Japan and South Korea, are operating for less than a week, and factory orders are less than a tenth of the amount ordered a year ago.
刘姿岑说，工厂会给年薪制的员工开出全额工资，对计件算薪酬的员工则会给一些补偿。
The factory pays full wages to its employees on an annual basis, with some compensation for piece-rate employees, says Mr. Liu.
因为工厂规模小，损失也相对较少，在几万元左右。
Because of the small size of the plant, the loss is relatively small, in the tens of thousands of dollars.
兴城泳装商贸城 拍摄：张馨予被寄予厚望的暑假兴城泳装人最为忧虑的，是如今这种“半停工”以及“盲目生产”的状态还会持续多久。
Xingcheng swimwear trade city filming: Zhang Xingcheng swimwear people who are placed high hopes that the summer vacation, the most worried about this "semi-shutdown" and "blind production" state will continue for long.
“可能开工十天半个月之后，我们的工厂就会面临着不知道该做什么的局面，”刘姿岑说，“如果一直没有单，可能就会继续给员工放假了。
"After perhaps half a month of construction, our factory will be faced with a situation where we don't know what to do," Liu said.
”潘丽也说，工厂大概还能坚持两个月，两个月后情况如果再不好转，可能就会给全体员工放假。
The factory will probably last another two months, and if things don't get better in two months' time, it could give the entire staff a holiday, 'says Ms. Pan.
南开大学最新研究显示，新冠疫情在湖北省以外的全国各地，有可能于2020年3月底至4月中旬趋于平复。
According to a recent study by Nankai University, the outbreak is likely to level off across the country outside Hubei province between the end of March and mid-April 2020.
钟南山院士则在日前参加广东省疫情防控专家座谈会时表示，全球疫情的发展估计将至少延续至6月份。
Academician Zhong Nan Shan recently attended the Guangdong Province epidemic prevention and control expert seminar said that the global epidemic is expected to continue until at least June.
无论如何，疫情似乎都不会在短期内迅速好转，人们评估新冠肺炎疫情对各个行业的冲击时，总会参考非典时期的情况。
In any case, it does not seem likely that the epidemic will improve rapidly in the short term, and the SARS situation will always be taken into account when assessing the impact of the outbreak on all sectors.
赵阳是第一个把兴城的泳装批发带到广州的，2003年他正在广州档口卖泳装，还清晰记得当时疫情对行业的影响。
Zhao Yang was the first person to bring wholesale swimwear from Xingcheng to Guangzhou, where he was selling swimsuits in 2003.
“非典期间我还一直在看店，生意是有的，只是少一些。
"I've been looking at stores all the time during SARS and there's business, just a little less.
后来政府一宣布非典结束，生意马上就好起来了，货来多少走多少。
As soon as the government announced the end of SARS, business would soon get better.
”经历过非典的赵阳说，今年泳装行业比当时难很多，他不敢预测今年泳装行业何时会好转，“最快也要6月份了。
Zhao Yang, who has experienced SARS, said the swimwear industry was much harder this year and he didn't know when it would turn around this year.
”随着欧洲和美国的疫情愈发严峻，兴城泳装厂仅存的外贸单或许都不好做了，这对内单全军覆没的兴城泳装行业来说是雪上加霜。
With the situation in Europe and the US getting tougher, Xingcheng's only foreign-trade list may not be as good as it already is, adding insult to injury to the ailing Xingcheng swimsuit industry.
刘姿岑担心疫情对泳装行业的影响会持续得更久。
Mr Liu worries that the epidemic's impact on the swimsuit industry will last longer.
由于全国中小学和各大高校一致推迟开学时间，四川、广东等多地教育部门已经表示学校可通过压缩暑期假期来补偿课时，这意味着今年学生的暑假将是不完整的。
With schools and colleges across the country delaying the start of classes, education authorities in Sichuan and Guangdong have said schools can compensate by cutting back on summer vacations, which means the summer holidays will not be complete.
暑假一向是旅游旺季，也是泳装行业一年中最重视的季节。
Summer vacation has always been the peak season for tourism and the most important season of the year for the swimwear industry.
“如果疫情持续的时间比较长，连7、8月旺季我们都要错过，今年一整年我们都很难过了。
"If the epidemic continues for a long time, we will miss out even in the high season of July and August," he said.
”泳装头部品牌在疫情中受损有限，面对疫情也更加乐观。
The head brand suffered limited damage from the outbreak and is more optimistic about the situation.
兴城的范德安是2019年线上全平台销量第一的泳装品牌，该品牌对界面时尚表示，疫情最严重的时期销量下降超过五成，但他们相信下半年将会迎来游泳健身与海岛出游的高峰期，泳装类目也将反弹进入爆发期。
Vandeuen of Xingcheng is the top-selling swimsuit brand on the 2019 line, which says sales have fallen by more than 50% during the worst of the epidemic, but believes swimming fitness and island travel will peak in the second half of the year and the swimsuit category will bounce back into action.
范德安认为疫情期间人们对于健康越来越看重，预计疫情得到全面控制后也会迎来全民运动的高潮，泳装类目85%的需求将会逐渐恢复。
Van der Sen believes that the growing emphasis on health during the epidemic is expected to lead to an upsurge in national sports once the epidemic is fully under control, with a gradual recovery in demand for 85 per cent of swimwear categories.
图片来源：范德安运动瑜伽产品前来救场事实上，兴城大多数中小型泳装企业在疫情期间都很被动，他们很难像服装企业或美妆企业一样，通过将卖货地点搬到线上而弥补损失，因为他们面临的不是找不到消费者的问题，而是暂时没有消费者的难题。
In fact, most small and medium sized swimwear companies in Xingcheng are passive during the epidemic, and it is difficult for them to make up for their losses by moving the selling point to the line, as is the case with apparel companies or makeup companies, which are faced with the problem of not finding customers, but of temporarily having no customers.
不过，相比中小企业，范德安这样的头部品牌有更大的空间对业务进行调整，挽回损失。
However, compared to small and medium-sized enterprises, Van der Ans head brand has more room to adjust the business to recover losses.
范德安从三年前开始进入运动瑜伽领域，推出了瑜伽垫、瑜伽球、瑜伽服等产品，还把泳装系列中的部分泳衣调整为运动健身、瑜伽慢跑等穿搭，但这些业务一直以来相对不那么受重视。
Vandeann started doing yoga three years ago, introducing yoga mats, balls, and suits, and tweaking some of the suits for exercise, yoga and jogging, but these have been relatively neglected.
疫情期间，居家健身突然成为新蓝海，范德安也开始发力推广旗下运动瑜伽产品。
During the epidemic, home fitness suddenly became the new blue sea, Van der Ann also began to promote its sports yoga products.
3.8购物节期间，范德安瑜伽品类销售同比增长465%，瑜伽垫同比增长668%。
3.8 During the shopping festival, sales of Van Der'an Yoga increased by 465 per cent year on year and Yoga Mat by 668 per cent year on year.
疫情期间，运动瑜伽品类产品占领了范德安店铺TOP榜 图片来源：范德安虽然运动瑜伽产品在范德安的全产品中占比不到两成，此类产品的销售无法弥补泳装销售额的损失，但企业至少维持了相对正常的运作，并可以为之后的消费反弹做准备。
During the epidemic, exercise yoga products occupied the van der Sans store TOP list. Although van der Ain's yoga products account for less than 20% of Vandeuen's total product, sales of such products do not compensate for the loss of swimwear sales, but the business has at least maintained a relatively normal operation and is ready for a subsequent consumption rebound.
运动瑜伽产品是泳装企业用来救场的。
Sports yoga products are used by swimwear companies to save the field.
疫情之后，范德安表示自己会继续专注于时尚泳装领域，潘丽、赵阳、刘姿岑等从业者也说兴城将继续坚持发展泳装行业。
After the outbreak, Vandeuen said he would continue to focus on fashion swimwear, and practitioners Panli, Zhao Yang and Liu Zhenzen also said Xingcheng would continue to develop the swimsuit industry.
毕竟泳装是兴城人投身三十余年的产业，这座城市已经诞生了一批泳装二代甚至泳装三代。
After all, swimwear is the industry of Xingcheng people in more than 30 years, this city has born a batch of swimwear second generation or even swimwear three generations.
而他们都在等待夏天的到来。
And they are all waiting for summer to come.
