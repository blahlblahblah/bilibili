从趋势上看，新冠肺炎全球大流行可能无法避免，中国需一边打好国内阻击战，一边应对全球疫情带来的新风险。
In terms of trends, a global Crowne Pneumonia pandemic is likely to be inevitable, with China having to cope with the new risks posed by the global epidemic while battling domestic blockades.
文 | 信娜 朱贺 编辑 | 王小      空格鉴于中国境外受新型冠状病毒疫情影响的国家和病例数量持续增加，2月28日，世界卫生组织（WHO）总干事谭德塞在日内瓦宣布，将新冠肺炎疫情级别由此前的“高”上调至“非常高”的水平。
With the number of countries and cases outside China affected by the new coronavirus epidemic continuing to rise, the World Health Organization's Director-General, Roger Tanner, announced in Geneva on February 28 that he has raised his new crown pneumonia level to "very high" levels.
这是WHO风险评估的最高级。
This is the highest level of WHO risk assessment.
截至北京时间3月2日早9时，境外累计确诊病例数逼近9000，其中，韩国确诊病例数4212例。
As of 9: 00 a.m. March 2, Beijing time, the cumulative number of confirmed cases abroad approached 9,000, of which 4,212 were confirmed in South Korea.
全球累计治愈569例，累计病亡137例。
A total of 569 cases and 137 cumulative cases were cured worldwide.
美国当地时间2月29日上午，美国卫生部证实其西海岸的华盛顿州有一名新冠肺炎患者死亡，这是截至目前美国官方公布的首例新冠肺炎死亡病例。
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Health confirmed the death of a New Crown Pneumonia in the western state of Washington on Tuesday morning, the first official death from pneumonia in the United States.
此外，美国西海岸三个州，先后发现感染源未知的新冠肺炎确诊病例，也提示新冠肺炎社区传播的可能性。
In addition, three states on the west coast of the United States have identified confirmed cases of nosocomial pneumonia of unknown origin, suggesting the possibility of community transmission of Newcap Pneumonia.
社区传播的风险在于，必然有其他未知、未隔离的感染者，病毒有进一步扩散的风险。
The risk of community transmission lies in the fact that there must be other unknown, unisolated infected persons, with the risk of further spread of the virus.
多位流行病学专家向《财经》记者分析，从现有的信息来判断，美国、韩国等地，均已出现新冠肺炎疫情社区传播。
Many epidemiologists to "Caijing" reporter analysis, from the available information to judge, the United States, South Korea, and other places, have occurred in the New Crown Pneumonia community transmission.
究竟如何围堵新冠肺炎，在北京大学公共卫生学院教授宁毅看来，早期任何防控措施都会受到争议。
To Ning Yi, a professor at the Peking University School of Public Health, how to contain pneumonia suggests any early intervention could be controversial.
每个国家在制定具体的防控措施时，也需考虑到本国的实际情况，平衡对经济文化和外交的冲击，因地制宜施行策略，不能一以概之。
When designing specific prevention and control measures, each country should also take into account its actual situation, balance economic, cultural and diplomatic impacts, and implement strategies in light of local conditions.
“也无法简单地评价哪种防控措施是对或者错，都是根据自身的情况来进行判断”。
"It is also impossible to simply assess which control measures are right or wrong, depending on the circumstances of the case."
全球多地现社区传播病例全球新冠肺炎疫情形势急转直下，也超出了中国疾控系统专家此前的预测。
The global outbreak of new crown pneumonia has plummeted, outpacing earlier predictions by China's disease-control experts.
3月1日，中国疾控中心一位相关负责人接受《财经》记者采访时称，我们得一边打国内新冠肺炎阻击战，一边同步应对全球大流行。
On March 1, a relevant CDC official told Caijing that we had to fight a global pandemic while fighting China's new crown pneumonia.
这比他三日前的分析，“一边继续打狙击战，一边有序恢复社会生活和经济运转，一边开展大流行准备”，更趋紧迫。
This is more urgent than his analysis of three days ago, "while continuing to fight sniper war, while orderly restoration of social life and economic functioning, while carrying out pandemic preparedness."
2月28日，谭德塞将新冠肺炎疫情级别调至风险评估的最高级时，认为多数病例仍可追踪到密切接触者，并未发现病毒自由传播的证据，“仍有机会控制这种病毒”。
On Feb. 28, Mr. Tanner moved the new crown pneumonia to the top of the risk assessment, saying most cases could still be traced to close contacts, no evidence of free transmission of the virus was found, and "there is still a chance of controlling the virus."
然而，美国西海岸三个州，先后发现感染源未知的新冠肺炎确诊病例。
However, in three states on the west coast of the United States, confirmed cases of nosocomial pneumonia have been detected with unknown sources.
华盛顿州斯诺霍米许县(Snohomish County )杰克森高中的一名学生最近居家隔离。
A student at Jackson High School in Snohomish County, Washington, was recently isolated at home.
该病患最近未去过亚洲，无旅游史，感染源未知。
The patient has not been to Asia recently and has no travel history.
这名高中生成为美国第四例感染源不明的新冠肺炎确诊病例。
The high school student became the fourth confirmed case of unexplained pneumonia in the United States.
美国疾病预防与控制中心（CDC）将其列为“社区传播可能案例”，目前感染源仍在调查中。
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention listed it as a possible case of community transmission, and the source of the infection is still under investigation.
另一端的欧洲，意大利因激增的新冠肺炎患者而受到关注。
At the other end of the spectrum in Europe, Italy has come under scrutiny for a surge in new crown pneumonia.
意大利是目前亚洲以外新冠病例最多的国家。
Italy currently has the highest number of new cases outside Asia.
截至3月1日，意大利共有1694人新冠病毒检测为阳性，比头一天的病例数1128增加了50%。
As of March 1, 1,694 people in Italy had tested positive for the new crown virus, up 50 percent from 1128 the day before.
多位流行病学专家向《财经》记者分析，从现有的信息来判断，美国、意大利、韩国等地，均已出现新冠肺炎疫情社区传播。
A number of epidemiologists to Caijing reporter analysis, judging from the available information, the United States, Italy, South Korea, and other places, have occurred in the New Crown Pneumonia community transmission.
中国近邻，韩国的疫情发展令人忧心。
In China's immediate neighborhood, South Korea's epidemic is worrying.
韩国中央防疫对策本部2日通报称，截至当天零时，境内新冠肺炎确诊病例增至4212例，较前一天下午4时增加476例。
By 0000 hours on the same day, the number of confirmed cases of pneumonia in China had risen to 4,212, an increase of 476 cases over the previous day at 4: 00 pm, the central anti-epidemic agency said.
疫情最为严重的大邱市累计确诊人数3081人，庆尚北道624人。
In Daegu, the worst affected city, a cumulative total of 3,081 people were diagnosed and 624 people in Gyeongshan North Province.
韩国已将新冠疫情的防控等级提升至最高级。
South Korea has raised the level of control of the new crown to the highest level.
韩国确诊人数从1000例增长到4000例，只用了4天。
The number of cases diagnosed in South Korea rose from 1,000 to 4,000 in just four days.
此时，韩国新冠疫情用“暴发”来形容并不为过。
At this point, South Korea's new crown outbreak with "outbreak" to describe it is not excessive.
多位流行病学家分析，根据现有公开报道，韩国新冠病毒扩散与当地教会活动不无关系。
Several epidemiologists have linked the spread of the virus to local church activity, according to publicly available reports.
韩国中央事故处理本部副本部长金刚立20日在记者会上说，“我们相信新冠病毒已在韩国本土出现‘早期的社区传播’现象。
"We believe there has been an early outbreak of community transmission of the virus in South Korea," Kim Gang-li, deputy minister of the Central Incident Management Department, told a news conference on Tuesday.
”这其中，不得不提的是，韩国第31号病例，他的另一重身份是，“新天地”大邱教会的信徒。
Among them, it has to be mentioned that South Korea's Case No. 31, another of his identities, is a member of the Taegu Church in the New World.
“31号病人”2月7日首次出现发冷、喉咙痛等症状，后前往大邱一医院接受治疗。
Patient 31 first developed chills, sore throat and went to Daegu Hospital for treatment on February 7.
在出现症状后，该患者曾两次参加大邱一教堂的“新天地教会”活动，此外，还曾前往首尔，使用过公共交通工具。
The patient attended the Church of Xintiandi at Taegu Church twice after the onset of symptoms, and travelled to Seoul, where he used public transport.
据韩联社报道，目前韩国确诊的病例中，大约60%和大邱的“新天地教会”有关，大约15%和庆尚北道的清道大南医院有关。
About 60 percent of the confirmed cases in South Korea are related to the Church of Xintiandi in Daegu and about 15 percent to the Ching Nan Hospital in Gyeongshan North Province, the Yonhap news agency reported.
新型冠状病毒疫情目前已经超出防疫网，开始在社区全面扩散。
The new coronavirus epidemic has now spread beyond the epidemic prevention network and started to spread across the community.
加拿大纽芬兰纪念大学医学院终身教授王培忠分析，如果引入病例造成第一、二代病例不断出现，意味着当地暴发流行开始了。
Life professor Wang Peizhong of the Memorial University of Newfoundland Medical School in Canada said that the introduction of cases that lead to the emergence of first and second generation cases could mean the onset of a local epidemic.
欧洲大陆最危机的国家是意大利。
The most crisis country on the continent is Italy.
该国感染人数已经破1000。
The number of infected people in the country has surpassed 1,000.
意大利多地政府颁布了特殊防控措施来阻止疫情蔓延，除了学校停课，市场、电影院、教堂等公共场所关闭，同时暂停公共活动。
Governments in many parts of Italy have enacted special control measures to stop the spread of the epidemic, in addition to school closures, the closure of public places such as markets, cinemas and churches, and the suspension of public activities.
该国北部的几个城镇也被封锁，禁止人们进出受疫情波及的地区。
Several towns in the north of the country have also been closed to people in areas affected by the epidemic.
这与中国各地采取的围堵策略相似。
This is similar to the containment strategy adopted throughout China.
围堵是指，在限定的地理范围内，采用医学和非医学（区域封锁、停学和停工等）干预策略和措施，以迅速阻断疫情传播。
Containment means the use of medical and non-medical intervention strategies and measures (regional blockades, school suspensions and lockouts, etc.) within a limited geographical area in order to rapidly interrupt the spread of the epidemic.
全球多地出现病例，也给中国防控带来压力。
The emergence of cases in many parts of the world has also put pressure on China's control.
2月29日，北京市报告2例自伊朗入境的新冠肺炎确诊病例，一天后，浙江省通报，新增1例由意大利输入确诊病例。
Feb. 29, Beijing reported two confirmed cases of New Crown Pneumonia from Iran, a day later, Zhejiang Province reported a new case of confirmed imported cases from Italy.
首都医科大学公共卫生学院副院长郭秀花对《财经》记者分析，现在要防止国外输入型病例，否则损失会更大。
Guo Xiuhua, vice-dean of the Institute of Public Health at Capital Medical University, told Caijing that it was time to prevent imported cases abroad, or the losses would be even higher.
“其他国家很难做到中国这种力度，这么多国家都出现了疫情，如果切不断传染源会很危险”。
"It is very difficult for other countries to do what China is doing. So many countries have had outbreaks and it would be dangerous to keep cutting the source of infection."
中国防控策略，由“围堵”变为“缓疫”道路恢复畅通，公共交通恢复，各地陆续复工，这是防疫从“阻击战”向“缓疫”策略转变的信号。
China's prevention and control strategy, which has been transformed from "containment" to "containment" road restoration, public transport rehabilitation, and the resumption of work in various places, is a sign of the shift in epidemic prevention from a "war of resistance" to a "containment" strategy.
后者是一种大流行发生后，全球各国都会采取的策略，也是WHO推荐策略。
The latter is a strategy that countries all over the world will adopt after a pandemic, and it is also recommended by WHO.
2月6日，中国疾控中心官网发布了一项主题为新冠肺炎疫情的紧急研究议程，聚焦传播和非药物缓疫策略，同时，对何为“缓疫”做了说明。
On February 6, the CDC's official website released an emergency research agenda on the new crown pneumonia epidemic, focusing on communication and non-drug containment strategies, as well as a description of what constitutes "containment."
缓疫是为了减轻疫情对医疗服务和社会运行的冲击和压力，采用医学和非医学干预策略和措施，延缓疫情增长速度，推迟流行高峰到来时间，压低峰值的策略。
The aim of the epidemic is to reduce the impact and pressure of the epidemic on medical services and social operations, and to adopt medical and non-medical intervention strategies and measures to slow the epidemic's growth rate, delay the onset of the epidemic and lower its peak.
“心理上比之前轻松了，但工作强度仍然很大”，3月1日，三位分别来自内蒙古、山东、山西的一线防控人员，发出相同的感叹。
"Psychologically, it is easier, but the intensity of the work is still very high," said the three frontline prevention and control personnel from Inner Mongolia, Shandong and Shanxi on March 1.
三者的共同点是，其所在区域均已下调了疫情防控应急响应级别。
What all three have in common is that their regions have reduced the level of emergency response to epidemic prevention and control.
这意味着，这些地方将陆续恢复经济社会正常运转。
This means that these places will be restored to normal economic and social functioning.
“公交恢复营运，说明疫情没有之前那么严重”，内蒙古某市一位铁路警察说。
"The resumption of public transport operations shows that the epidemic is not as serious as it was before," said a railway policeman in Inner Mongolia.
从上周开始，该市已陆续恢复公交及出租车运行。
Since last week, the city has been resuming bus and taxi operations.
2月22日开始，山西某县医院的医务工作人员李可（化名）彻底告别了县城路口，恢复到正常工作中，“现在还有3个同事在小区门口守着”。
Feb. 22, Shanxi County Hospital medical staff Li Ke (alias) said goodbye to the county intersection, returned to normal work, "there are still three colleagues guarding the door."
23天前，她开始定期在进城路口对来往车辆进行体温检测，排查发热人员。
Twenty-three days ago, she began regular body temperature checks of commuter traffic at urban intersections to screen for fevers.
上述中国疾控中心相关负责人解释，如果发生全球大流行，则中国应对下一波流行的策略将难以再延续当下实施的高强度的阻击策略，不得不转为缓疫策略：即采取非药物干预措施压低流行高峰，减轻其对医疗服务体系的冲击强度，降低病死率。
The CDC official explained that if a global pandemic occurs, China's response to the next wave of popular strategies will be difficult to sustain the current high-intensity containment strategy, and will have to shift to a containment strategy that uses non-drug interventions to keep the epidemic low, reduce its impact on the health-care system and reduce the fatality rate.
截至2月29日24时，湖北新增确诊病例570例，其中武汉565例。
As of 2400 hours on February 29, 570 new cases had been confirmed in Hubei, 565 of which were in Wuhan.
2月19日以来，武汉新增病例在300-500区间已出现一个持续10天之久的“拉锯期”。
Since February 19, Wuhan in the 300-500 range has been a 10-day "pull saw period."
郭秀花认为，国内防控要因地制宜，分地区、分级别，进行科学防控。
Guo Xiuhua believes that domestic control should be adapted to local conditions, sub-regional, hierarchical, scientific control.
如果一个省、市十多天、二十天没有出现疫情，除了进入这个地区的外来人员需要隔离，该地区可以适当降低防控级别，正常生活。
If an epidemic does not occur in a province or city for more than 10 or 20 days, the area can be appropriately reduced to a level of control and normal life, with the exception of outsiders who need to be quarantined.
“武汉的疫情目前已经进入中后期，再过一段时间，大概一周、十天的样子，新增确诊病例就可以降至百位、十位、个位“。
"Wuhan epidemic has now entered the middle and late stage, a period of time, about a week, 10 days, the appearance of new confirmed cases can be reduced to 100, 10, a bit.
中国工程院院士钟南山对这一时间点的预测是，4月底。
Zhong Nan Shan, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, predicts this point in time at the end of April.
他的分析是，这次疫情传染情况可能比SARS还高，根据目前的统计来看，大概一个人能传染2到3个人之间，说明传染得非常快。
His analysis is that the spread of the disease may be higher than SARS. According to current statistics, one person can infect between two and three people, indicating a very rapid spread of the disease.
在中国来看，有信心4月底基本控制疫情。
From China's perspective, there is confidence that the epidemic will be largely contained by the end of April.
防止疫情卷土重来防控等级调整，医院没变，还是24小时轮班，医护人员也没有正常的周末休息。
Prevention and control of the resurgence of the re-adjustment of the level of control, hospitals remain unchanged, or 24-hour shifts, medical staff did not have normal weekend rest.
不过，随着各个路口陆续开放，因高速公路重新开放，山西某地社区工作者王文（化名）的“份内事”又增加了一项，“挨个打电话核实大车司机的行踪”。
However, with the opening of intersections and the reopening of the expressway, Wang Wen (not his real name), a community worker in Shanxi, added a new item, "one after the other, to verify the whereabouts of the bus driver."
他们所做的事，都与防止疫情“卷土重来“相关。
What they are doing is all about preventing a "return" of the epidemic.
加拿大纽芬兰纪念大学医学院终身教授王培忠认为，中国一些地方连续数日新增确诊病例为0，说明该地方，本次流行已经进入尾声或结束。
Wang Peizhong, a tenured professor at Memorial University of Newfoundland Medical School in Canada, said the number of new cases confirmed for several days in a row in some parts of China meant the epidemic was coming to an end or was over.
但需要警惕的是，如果有大量易感人群的存在，控制不好，暴发流行会反复，因此流行曲线有时会有几个高峰。
Caution should be exercised, however, that if large numbers of vulnerable populations are present, control is poor and outbreaks are recurrent, so the epidemic sometimes has several peaks.
2月21日，湖北、浙江、山东五所监狱曾公布发生新冠肺炎疫情。
On February 21, five prisons in Hubei, Zhejiang and Shandong announced the outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia.
其中，山东任城监狱确诊200例，疑似10例，浙江十里丰监狱确诊34例。
Among them, Shandong Ren Cheng prison confirmed 200 cases, suspected 10 cases, Zhejiang 10 Li Feng prison confirmed 34 cases.
“不排除局部会发生小的暴发，永远不能排除这个可能，但整个趋势是快速递减的”，宁毅形容，现在是点点星火，要警戒这些星火。
"Small localized outbreaks cannot be ruled out, but the overall trend is rapidly diminishing," Ning said, describing the sparks as a warning.
控制不好的话，就是一把大火。
If it's not under control, it's a fire.
有警戒心，点点星火才会越来越少。
With vigilance, the little spark will become less and less.
在国务院联防联控机制3月1日15时的新闻发布会上，国家卫生健康委新闻发言人米锋提到，接下来，需应对复工复产和国外病例不断增多所带来的风险。
At a press conference on March 1 at 3: 00 pm, State Council spokesman Mifeng said that the next step is to deal with the risks posed by the resumption of work and the increasing number of cases abroad.
除了两例伊朗输入病例外，3月1日0-24时，浙江省新增1例由意大利输入确诊病例。
In addition to two cases of Iranian imports, a new case was confirmed from Italy in Zhejiang Province at 0-24: 00 March.
该患者26日晚从意大利米兰出发，经莫斯科转机，于27日22时到达上海浦东机场，后包车于28日上午8时抵达浙江省青田县。
The patient left Milan, Italy, on the night of the 26th, via Moscow transit, at 22: 00 in Shanghai Pudong Airport, after the charter car arrived in Qingtian, Zhejiang Province, at 8 a.m. on the 28th.
随即被直接送往青田县集中隔离医学观察点开展医学观察。
Immediately was sent directly to Qingtian county concentrated isolation medical observation point for medical observation.
3月1日，经新冠病毒核酸检测阳性，目前在医院隔离治疗。
On 1 March, the virus tested positive for nucleic acid and is currently being isolated in hospital.
同日，深圳市卫生健康委报告1例境外输入新冠肺炎确诊病例，该患者由英国回国，途径香港。
On the same day, the Shenzhen Health Commission reported a confirmed case of overseas importation of Newly Coronary Pneumonia. The patient returned from the UK via Hong Kong.
郭秀花建议，应对疫情的全球大流行，出入境需严控，原则上疫情高发区国家航班停止，比如切断航班。
Guo suggested that in response to the global pandemic, entry and exit should be strictly controlled. In principle, flights from countries with high epidemic areas should be stopped, such as flight cuts.
同时，也要切断和高发疫情国家的人员往来。
At the same time, we must cut off people from countries with high prevalence rates.
只要该国有疫情，该国人员回到中国之后，至少要隔离十四天。
Whenever there is an epidemic in the country, the country's personnel return to China to be quarantined for at least 14 days.
隔离期过后可以正常生活、上班，但也要注意防护。
After the isolation period can normal life, work, but also pay attention to the protection.
韩国外交部消息显示，截至3月2日上午9时10分，因新型冠疫情对韩国采取入境管制措施的国家和地区为80个，共有36个国家和地区对韩国采取全面或限期禁止入境措施。
As of 9: 10 am on March 2, a total of 80 countries and regions have adopted measures to control the entry into the ROK due to the new crown epidemic. A total of 36 countries and regions have adopted comprehensive or time-bound measures against the ROK, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
防控输入性病例，压力还是存在的，宁毅说，需要形成常态化管理，并警惕输入性超级传播者。
Pressure still exists to prevent and control imported cases, says Ningyi, who says there is a need for normalized management and vigilance against imported super-carriers.
