从2020年1月15日回武汉至今，我在武汉整整呆了24天。
From January 15, 2020 back to Wuhan, I spent 24 days in Wuhan.
这是我自大学毕业以来在武汉呆得最久的一段时间，也是自去年家人搬回武汉陪伴最长的一段日子，更是我人生至今最困难悲伤的一段岁月。
It was the longest time I've been in Wuhan since I graduated from college, the longest time my family moved back to Wuhan last year, and the most difficult and sad period of my life.
。
.
一切都因新型冠状病毒疫情而起，因深处武汉耳闻目睹而思考深刻，我试着重新理解生命和生活。
Everything has been caused by the new coronavirus outbreak, because the depth of Wuhan hearing and seeing and thinking deeply, I try to re-understand life and life.
在37岁这个年富力强的年龄遇上这样的危机，并籍此和自己对话，观察每个人在国难家愁中的表现，感受人性和人心，也算不枉这24天所遭受的苦难。
At the age of thirty-seven, at a ripe old age, it was a time of crisis, and it was worth the suffering of those 24 days to talk to oneself, to observe the human nature and the hearts of each of us in the midst of a national tragedy.
。
.
每一次重大疫情、地震、洪涝等灾难背后，都不只是医学或地质、自然环境问题，而是整个社会生态、生活方式出现系统性危机的映照。
Every major epidemic, earthquake, flood and other disasters, not only medical or geological, natural environmental problems, but also the entire social ecology, way of life reflected in the systemic crisis.
新型冠状病毒的彻底根除和杜绝重现，当然要靠科学技术和医疗手段的提升，但更需要推动社会系统改革和治理结构调整，需要国民素质的自我提升和进步。
The total eradication and elimination of the new coronavirus will, of course, depend on the improvement of science and technology and medical treatment, but more needs to be done to reform the social system and restructure governance.
。
.
在人生的37年里，我深信实干兴邦而非多难兴邦。
In the 37 years of my life, I am convinced that you can thrive rather than prosper.
以我记事起的经历为例：1998年夏天湖北大洪水，我在长江大堤填土装沙袋、找管涌，15岁的年纪在蚊蝇肆虐的工棚里守了一个月；2003年春天SARS病毒蔓延，我在武汉的校园里每天靠教室熏醋、喝板蓝根抗击非典，一个月没有出校门；2008年春节南方雪灾，5月汶川地震，我在人生谷底北漂进京，拿出少得可怜的50多块钱积蓄捐往灾区，自愧于“天下兴亡，匹夫无能”；2012年玛雅预言人类末日并未成真，但2013年禽流感病毒还是令人惶恐不安，离当年汶川不远的芦山县地震灾情如5年前噩梦重演……。
In the summer of 1998, I filled sandbags and looked for pipes at the Yangtze River levee. When the SARS virus spread in Wuhan, I spent one month in the classroom fumigating and drinking Banlangen to fight SARS.
一个看似偶然的巧合浮出水面：中国每隔5年会制定一次五年计划，并由此开展一轮宏观调控与转型升级。
A seemingly accidental coincidence emerges: China prepares a five-year plan every five years, leading to a round of macroeconomic regulation and transformation.
与此同时，中国每隔5年左右会遭遇一次灾害危机（1998、2003、2008、2013、2020……），而且每一次宏观调控的时点与自然灾害危机基本一致，也正是新政府换届的年份。
At the same time, China faces a disaster crisis every five years or so (1998, 2003, 2008, 2013, 2020...), and the timing of each macro-regulation is roughly the same as the natural-disaster crisis, and it is the year of the new government's change.
内忧外患、革故鼎新的困难叠加效应，对执政者来说都是不小的考验，不仅需要智慧和耐心，更需要魄力，需要为人民服务的信仰和大德。
The cumulative effect of internal and external troubles and new difficulties is no small test for those in power, requiring not only wisdom and patience, but also boldness, faith and virtue in the service of the people.
。
.
这种巧合绝非偶然，它恰恰验证一条真理：这世界唯一不变的就是变化本身。
This coincidence is by no means accidental; it only confirms the truth that the only constant in the world is change itself.
小到一个人、一项制度，大到一个国家、一套治理体系，如果不自省自查，不改革创新，就会僵化生病，就会危机重重，就会出现天灾人祸。
Small to a person, a system, a country, a system of governance, if we do not look into ourselves, do not reform innovation, will ossify the disease, will be dangerous, there will be natural and man-made disasters.
名医治病始于疾病发作之前，名匠都选在天晴时修屋顶，我们通常所见壮士断腕、力挽狂澜的故事，都是在为贻误时机的过错买单。
The cure begins before the onset of a disease, and the smiths choose to repair their roofs in fine weather. The stories we usually see of men breaking their wrists and turning back the tide are paying for the mistakes that make us miss the times.
没有英雄的时代才是最好的时代，不需要英雄的社会才是最好的社会。
The times without heroes are the best. Societies that do not need heroes are the best.
。
.
昨天，朋友圈和公众号都在追悼祭奠一位本不该成为英雄的武汉眼科医生——李文亮。
Yesterday, friends and the public were mourning the commemoration of a Wuhan ophthalmologist who should not have become a hero - Li Wenliang.
其实，他只是一位说真话的普通人而已。
In fact, he is just an ordinary person who speaks the truth.
。
.
越是盛世，越需要说真话，听真话。
The more prosperous times, the more need to speak the truth, listen to the truth.
。

今天我还在幻想：2020年1月15日坐错高铁的插曲，是否是老天爷给我的某种善意暗示？。
Today I wonder if the high-speed rail episode of January 15, 2020 was some kind of benevolent hint from God.
因为写企业史、企业家传记需要投入大量时间采访、调研，我的工作需要经常出差，很多时候都赶在高铁发车、安检关闭的最后时刻挤上去，有惊无险完成旅程。
Because writing a business history and a biography of an entrepreneur takes a lot of time to interview and research, I have to travel a lot, and I have to rush to the last minute when the high-speed train starts and security checks close down.
1月15日上午，我拿着打印好的G517高铁凭证准备回武汉，赶在关门前最后一分钟上车。
On the morning of January 15, I returned to Wuhan with my typed G517 voucher and got on the bus at the last minute before closing.
高铁缓缓开动，我好不容易找到座位，却发现一位大妈已经占座。
The high-speed train moved slowly. I had a hard time finding my seat, but I found one already occupied.
我和她核对车票，她说不识字，儿子送她坐到这儿，让我自己核对。
I checked my ticket with her. She said she could not read. My son took her here and asked me to check it for myself.
我发现车厢号、座位号、日期完全一样，又生气又不解，旁边旅客提醒我：“你坐错车了，这是G1577，你的票是G517。
I found the car number, seat number, date exactly the same, angry and puzzled, the passenger beside me reminded me: "You took the wrong car, this is G1577, your ticket is G517.
”。
"
我定睛一看，真是我错了，连忙说“对不起”，然后找到车厢连接处用手机查询G1577的信息，发现前面几站和G517一致，只是终点站到阜阳西而不是武汉。
I looked intently, really I was wrong, hurriedly said "sorry," and then found the car connection with a mobile phone G1577 information, found that the previous stations and the G517, only to Fuyang West instead of Wuhan.
于是，我连忙操作12306网站改签或退票，重新订票，看能否从阜阳西买票回武汉，或者中途下车再换乘新车。
So, I quickly operation 12306 website to sign or refund, reorder tickets, see if can buy tickets from Fuyang West back to Wuhan, or stop to transfer to a new car.
只是12306网站设置了同一时间不能再买新车票的规则，我打12306电话订票只有语音提示根本没有人工服务，一边操作一边抱怨12306的BUG。
Only 12306 sets the rule that you can't buy a new ticket at the same time. I make 12306 phone bookings with no manual service at all, complaining about BUG at 12306.
这时列车长走过来，听我道明原委，提供简便易行的处理方案：到保定站下车，然后等G517到来直接上车，对号入座平安回家。
Then the conductor came up to me and gave me a simple solution: get off at Baoding station, and then wait for the G517 to get on the bus and get back safely.
就这样，我有惊无险的换车成功，并吃一堑长一智学到新技能。
In this way, I had a terrific change of car and learned new skills through trial and error.
这几年，我们对手机和互联网依赖太多，求助时忽视身边专业人士的意见，社交时忽略对身边至亲的关爱。
In recent years, we rely too much on mobile phones and the Internet, ignore the advice of professionals around us when we ask for help, and neglect to care for our loved ones when we socialize.
。
.
与我一同换车的还有一位因送人未及时下车的小伙子，他也在保定下车，然后到反方向乘车返回北京，老妈则一路向南。
I was accompanied by a young man who did not get off the bus in time. He got off in Baoding, then drove back to Beijing in the opposite direction.
。
.
当天下午17:40，我准时抵达武汉站，然后乘车回家，匆匆给家人做了一顿晚饭，就拎着装满排骨汤的保温桶赶往医院。
That day at 17: 40 p.m., I arrived at Wuhan station on time, and then drove home, hastily made a dinner for my family, carrying a bucket full of chop soup to the hospital.
女儿已经住院一天，第二天准备做耳前瘘管手术，这个手术本来早该进行，只怕住院耽误学习才拖到寒假。
The daughter had been hospitalized for a day and was due to undergo a preauricular fistula operation the next day, which was long overdue and delayed her studies until winter vacation.
。
.
我是湖北黄冈人，武汉求学4年，2006年大学毕业南下广东，2008年到北京，到2019年北漂已11年。
I am from Huanggang, Hubei Province. Wuhan studied for 4 years. I graduated from university in 2006 and went to Guangdong in 2006.
此时，我面临孩子即将读小学的问题，虽然有房却无户口，考虑到将来初中、高中求学困难等问题，而且我的父母也可以常年团聚，我们在2019年9月举家迁往武汉。
At this point, I was faced with the problem of my child going to primary school. Although I had a house but no account, considering the difficulties of attending junior and senior high schools in the future and my parents being reunited all year round, we moved to Wuhan in September 2019.
6年前我提前在武汉买了一套房，安居乐业并不复杂。
Six years ago, I bought a suite in Wuhan in advance. Living and working happily is not complicated.
曾经困惑我三五年的选择问题迎刃而解，有时候豁然开朗不过一念之间。
Once confused me three or five years of choice problems can be solved, sometimes suddenly clear only an idea.
。
.
毕竟创业维艰，因为公司业务持续增长，规模不断扩大，我必须坚守北京孤军奋战。
After all, because the company's business continued to grow, the scale of expansion, I must adhere to Beijing alone.
2019年与家人聚少离多，以至于有一次带女儿去医院看病，医生问孩子身高、体重、血型时我竟一问三不知，旁边几位妈妈不可思议的哄然大笑。
In 2019, I spent so much time with my family that I took my daughter to the hospital for a visit. When the doctor asked my child how tall he was, how much weight he was wearing and what type of blood, I didn't know.
。
.
1月15日，武汉下着小雨，我在雨夜中习惯性地前往家附近的湖北省人民医院东院，住院部楼上楼下找遍都没有找到孩子，打电话给妻子，才知道我又摆了一次乌龙——跑错了医院，匆忙打车赶往武汉同济光谷医院。
On January 15, it was raining in Wuhan, I habitually went to the East Hospital of Hubei Provincial People's Hospital near my home in the rainy night. I didn't find the children in the inpatient building.
女儿见面第一句话就调侃我是“猪爸爸”：“听说你今天不仅坐错了车，还跑错了医院，怎么搞的嘛？”。
"I heard that you not only took the wrong car today, but also ran to the wrong hospital, why?"
这一天，从高铁站到社区、街头，再到医院，武汉与往年并无两样：武汉站迎来送往的客流摩肩接踵，社区的住宅楼万家灯火，街头商铺熙熙攘攘、车水马龙，快递小哥骑着电动车冲刺一年中最繁忙的丰收季节。
Wuhan is a busy day, from high-speed rail stations to communities, streets and hospitals. Wuhan is the busiest season of the year, with crowds of tourists coming and going from Wuhan to Shanghai, residential buildings in the community, busy shops and express delivery cars.
医院的病房里一片祥和，电视机里播放着春节前人们喜闻乐见的节目和音乐，每个人都盼望过年之前顺利手术出院，健康迎接新年。
The hospital ward was peaceful and the TV was filled with programs and music popular before the Spring Festival. Everyone looked forward to a smooth operation and a healthy New Year's Eve.
除了医生护士，几乎没有人戴口罩。
Few people wear masks except for the doctors and nurses.
。
.
后来我们知道，此时的武汉、湖北乃至整个中国，正深处不期而至的瘟疫之中：2019年12月30日，武汉市卫健委发布紧急通知，称武汉市部分医疗机构陆续出现不明原因肺炎病人；31日，武汉市卫健委首次公开通报，称已发现27例病例、其中7例病情严重，其余病例病情稳定可控，“调查未发现明显人传人现象，未发现医务人员感染”；2020年新年第一天，大量媒体集中报道华南海鲜批发市场休市整治的消息，武汉市公安局则通报“已传唤8名违法人员，并依法进行了处理”，这8个人后来被网友称作“庚子八君子”，其中就包括李文亮。
On December 30, 2019, Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued an emergency notice saying that 27 cases, seven of which were serious and the rest were under control. The Wuhan Municipal Public Security Bureau announced that "no apparent human-to-human contact was found and the rest were treated according to law."
。
.
直到2020年1月15日，武汉市卫健委的通报，依然是无新增、无死亡，“尚未发现明确的人传人证据，整体可防可控。
Until January 15, 2020, Wuhan City Health Commission reported that there is no new, no death, "no clear evidence of human-to-human, the overall preventable controllable.
”在此期间，湖北省、武汉市省市两会如期有序举行，各界迎春晚会、年终表彰会隆重召开，几天后还出现百步亭社区一年一度的万人聚餐的生动报道。
In the meantime, the provincial and municipal assemblies in Hubei province and Wuhan have been held as scheduled, with welcoming spring parties and year-end commendations being solemnly held.
这些热火朝天的年节活动，配合卫健委字斟句酌的权威措辞，令武汉民众放松警惕，也令病毒肆虐蔓延，我们就这样错过了最佳的疫情防控期。
These fiery days, together with the Wei Jiancao words carefully authoritative words, so that Wuhan people relax their vigilance, but also the spread of the virus, we missed the best prevention and control period.
。
.
由于每天吃住都在医院，而且经常洗手，我在1月16日晚上摘下浪琴表，两天后它不再走动，时间定格在1月18日2时13分18秒，今天依然安静的躺在我书桌的抽屉里。
As I live and eat in the hospital every day and wash my hands often, I took off my watch on the night of January 16 and stopped walking two days later. It was still lying quietly in my desk drawer today at 2.13: 18 on January 18.
我真的希望时间能够静止，给所有人一次重新准备的机会，给犯错者一次赎罪反省的机会，让无辜的人不必死去，不必逃离，不必担惊受怕，不必孤独痛苦。
I really want time to stand still, to give everyone a chance to be reprepared, to give the wrongdoer an opportunity for redemption, so that innocent people do not have to die, do not have to flee, do not have to fear, do not have to suffer alone.
。
.
因为，每一个春节团圆的日子，都花费了我们一年的时间去等待。
Because, every Spring Festival reunion day, all spent us one year to wait.
。

女儿的手术一切顺利，1月19日上午，护士换药时告诉我，这两天就可以出院。
My daughter's operation went well, and on the morning of January 19, the nurse told me that she would be discharged in two days.
在医院陪护的日子里，我每天用手机处理工作，偶尔刷屏看信息。
During the hospital days, I used my cell phone to do my work every day, occasionally scrubbing the screen to see the information.
当天晚上8点左右，妻子微信发给我一张截图，某个群里有人透露，我家附近的湖北省人民医院东院，收治了4位“冠性新病毒”病人，可能是大家对新病毒还不熟悉，连病毒名词都写错了。
About 8: 00 pm that night, my wife sent me a screenshot, a certain group revealed that my nearby Hubei Provincial People's Hospital East Hospital, admitted four patients, may not be familiar with the new virus, even the virus terminology wrong.
。
.
1月20日上午，妻子再次给我发微信，说武汉病毒肺炎好像很严重，要不要取消大年初二回娘家的高铁票。
January 20 morning, my wife sent me a message again, saying that Wuhan virus pneumonia seems to be very serious, whether to cancel the second day of the Lunar New Year back to her family high-speed tickets.
我并没有足够警惕，告诉她看情况等明天见面再说，并且分享第二天女儿将出院的好消息。
I wasn't alert enough to tell her to wait until tomorrow, and to share the good news that my daughter would be discharged the next day.
。
.
当天下午，临床的小哥俩之中的哥哥治愈出院，换成一位60多岁的老大爷入住。
That afternoon, the clinical younger brother cured and discharged, replaced by a 60-year-old grandfather to live.
大爷从黄冈蕲春医院转到武汉，应该是肺部疾病，呼吸急促艰难，每隔几秒钟就大声喘气，伴随连续不断的咳嗽和吐痰，说话时只有语气没有声音。
However, the Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon Agkistrodon proceedings are
此刻我心里特别恐慌，大白天就赶紧把床帘拉起来做粗放隔离。
At this moment I am particularly frightened, in broad daylight quickly pull up the bed curtain to do extensive isolation.
晚上大爷做完手术回到病房，喉管处包着纱布，依然不停的咳嗽吐痰，父亲说当年大伯就是类似的病情折磨而去世，如果放到今天，做完手术就有救了。
In the evening after the surgery returned to the ward, the throat is wrapped gauze, still coughing sputum, father said the uncle is similar to the disease and died, if put today, the surgery will be saved.
。
.
也就是在这天晚上，我从手机看到一个久违的身影，钟南山院士时隔17年再次铿锵发声，在央视告诫观众：有“人传人”现象，有医务人员感染，提醒大众戴口罩，没有特殊情况不要去武汉。
That night, I saw a long time ago from the mobile phone, academician Zhong Nan Shan every 17 years again sonorous voice, in CCTV admonished the audience: there are "person-to-person" phenomenon, there are medical staff infected, remind the public to wear masks, no special circumstances do not go to Wuhan.
。
.
我看完忍不住吼了一声“我操！”，随后，我看到新华社发布消息，国家领导人对新冠病毒疫情作出重要指示，此时我才惊魂未定的意识到，新冠病毒疫情的形势已十万火急，特别严重。
I could not help but yell "Fuck it!" and then I saw the Xinhua news agency announce that national leaders had given important instructions on the New Crown Virus epidemic, when I realized with some trepidation that the situation of the New Crown Virus epidemic was extremely urgent and serious.
。
.
这天晚上，我躺在从医院租借的狭窄帆布行军床上，伴随身旁老大爷无休无止的咳嗽声，脑海里翻涌起2003年抗击非典的情景，一夜无眠。
That night, as I lay on the cramped canvas beds I had rented from the hospital, my mind swelled with the endless cough of the old man next to me, and I had a sleepless night of fighting SARS in 2003.
我暗自下决心，无论明天医生如何吩咐，我一定要办理出院手续，赶紧回家。
I made up my mind that no matter what the doctor ordered me to do tomorrow, I must go through the discharge formalities and hurry home.
。
.
1月21日上午，主治医师告诉我中午可以办理出院，我赶紧收拾住院物品，准备结算单据。
January 21 morning, the attending physician told me that I can be discharged at noon, I hurriedly packed the hospital supplies, prepare settlement documents.
从医院下楼的时候，我发现一夜之间戴口罩的人骤然增加，从之前约不到3%增加到30%。
As I went downstairs from the hospital, I noticed a sudden increase in the number of people wearing masks overnight, from less than 3 per cent to 30 per cent.
我在同济光谷医院地铁口的药店买了一包口罩，10只装16.5元，赶紧抽出一只戴上。
I bought a bag of masks at the drugstore at the subway entrance of Tongji Guang Gu Hospital.
回到住院部，我发现管电梯的大姐也戴上了口罩，电梯停到9楼时，大姐悄悄对我说：“我现在最怕9楼有人上下电梯，呼吸科黑（吓）死人！”到10楼大门处，保安大哥开始拿额温枪测体温，并夸奖“年轻人比老头们配合得多”。
Back in the inpatient department, I found the elevator manager also put on the mask, elevator parking to the 9th floor, I secretly said: "I am afraid of the ninth floor elevator up and down, breathing black (scared) dead!" To the 10th floor gate, the security guard began to take a temperature check, and praise "young people more than old men.
这些都是一夜之间的变化，只要官方让信息公开透明，老百姓的智商、经验和执行力不会差。
These are changes overnight, as long as the authorities make information open and transparent, people's IQ, experience and execution will not be poor.
。
.
我发信息让妻子取消了大年初二回娘家的计划，同时也取消了让父母初二回黄冈老家的计划。
I sent a message to my wife to cancel her plans to return to her mother's home in the second year of Spring Festival, as well as her parents' plans to return to Huang Gang.
一个多月之前，80多岁的外婆与世长辞，按照老家传统，大年初二这天要举行隆重的祭奠仪式，不过老家的舅舅正考虑取消。
A little over a month ago, Grandma in her 80s died. In accordance with her old family tradition, a solemn ceremony was to be held on the second day of the New Year.
过了几分钟，武汉的舅舅打电话告诉我：“鉴于当前疫情形势严峻，原定于腊月二十八晚上的家庭聚餐取消。
A few minutes later, my uncle in Wuhan called to tell me: "In view of the serious situation of the current epidemic situation, the family dinner scheduled for the evening of 28 December will be cancelled.
”我当场赞成这个决定，到今天都特别感谢！。
"I supported the decision on the spot, and I am especially grateful today.
临出院之前，我和女儿同病友道别，祝大家早日康复，尽量提前出院。
Before leaving the hospital, my daughter and I said goodbye to our sick friends. I wish you a speedy recovery and early discharge.
一位比我们来得早几天的父亲憋不住了，焦躁无奈的说道：没办法啊！现在医院最危险，我看手机上病毒肺炎已经死了好几个了！。
A father who came a few days earlier than we did not hold his breath, said impatiently: No way! Now the hospital is the most dangerous, I see the cell phone virus pneumonia has died several!
中午从医院出来的时候，戴口罩的人已经达到70%。
By the time they left the hospital at noon, 70 percent of them were wearing masks.
我像平时一样打了一辆滴滴，司机并未戴口罩，并神秘兮兮的告诉我，他刚拉了一位某著名医院的护士长：“听说这个病毒比非典还厉害些，今天有些司机已经不愿意出来，估计过两天你更不好打车了。
I hit a drip as usual, the driver didn't wear a mask, and he told me mysteriously that he had just pulled the head nurse of a famous hospital: "I heard that the virus is worse than SARS.
”。
"
我说：“你抓紧这两天多跑几趟，好好爱惜身体，把口罩戴到。
I said, "You should make a few more trips these two days to cherish your body and put on your mask.
为自己也是为乘客着想，说不定明天你不戴口罩就没人敢坐你的车。
Think about yourself and the passengers. Maybe tomorrow no one will dare to ride in your car without a mask.
”。
"
或许是我的直话惹司机生气了，他不以为然地说：“人家护士长说了，预防这种病毒主要靠自身免疫力，再就是要休息好，我觉得戴口罩起不到什么作用。
Maybe my blunt words made the driver angry. He said angrily, "The head nurse told me that the main defense against this virus is immunity, or to rest well, and I don't think wearing a mask will help.
我身体好得很，以前外套拉链都不用拉，风里来雨里去，今天还特地把拉链拉上了。
I am in good health. I used to zip up my coat, but today I zipped it up in the wind and rain.
”。
"
要是在平时我就哼哼哈哈祝福他搪塞过去，今天我决定批评他一顿：“我刚从医院出来，知道健康有多重要。
Today, I decided to criticize him for just coming out of the hospital knowing how important it is to be healthy.
你也是上有老下有小，要养家糊口，万一中招了，春节黄金期你一分钱都赚不到。
You are also up and down, to support the family, in the event of a confession, Spring Festival gold you can not earn a cent.
你每天接送的都是跟医院打交道的人，最容易感染病毒细菌，其中80%都是通过口水飞沫传播，口罩能起到大作用。
You pick up people who deal with hospitals every day and are most susceptible to viral infections, 80% of which are spread in droplets and face masks.
你再犹豫，明天连口罩都买不到。
If you hesitate, you won't be able to buy a mask tomorrow.

大哥或许是听进去了我的话，一再表示等会儿就去找地方买口罩。
Big Brother may have listened to me and repeatedly said that he would find a place to buy a mask later.
我下车的时候还不忘提醒他：一定要戴口罩。
When I got out of the car, I still reminded him to wear a mask.

到小区门口，我才突然发现，对面的商业街上新开了一家门面不小的野味餐厅，不过看起来已经关门歇业好几天了。
In front of the small community, I suddenly found that the street across the street opened a large new venison restaurant, but it seems to have been closed for several days.

其实，湖北人没有吃野味的传统，起码我从小到大及在武汉求学期间都没有吃过，这或许是近几年暴发户之间兴起的粗鄙的饮食潮流。
In fact, Hubei people do not eat the tradition of game, at least I have not eaten since childhood and Wuhan, this may be the upstart in recent years between the vulgar eating trend.
每逢冬天，湖北人最爱的依然各种鱼类、排骨煨藕汤、红菜薹等。
Every winter, Hubei people still love a variety of fish, ribs simmer lotus root soup, red bolts and so on.

回家的感觉真好。
It's good to be home.
女儿出院之后，一家人团聚其乐融融，我每天最大的乐趣就是在厨房做饭。
After my daughter was discharged from the hospital, the family reunited happily. My greatest joy every day was cooking in the kitchen.
女儿无拘无束的看动画片《猫和老鼠》，六岁半都能看懂美国人想象力背后的各种梗，我隔着书房的门，都能听到她不时发出格格的笑声。
My daughter watched the animated film Cats and Mice, and at the age of six-and-a-half I could see the pegs behind the American imagination, and I could hear her giggling now and then through the door of my study.
除了增加口罩防护，生活一切如常，在京东订购的波士顿大龙虾和梭子蟹、黑虎虾能如期到货，北京顺丰快递的图书能按时抵达。
In addition to the face mask protection, life as usual, ordered in the Beijing East Boston lobster and spindle crab, black tiger shrimp can be delivered on time, Beijing Shunfeng express books can arrive on time.

1月23日上午十点，武汉宣布封城，高铁、机场关闭，公交、地铁、轮渡等公共交通停运。
January 23 10: 00 a.m., Wuhan announced the closure of the city, high-speed rail, the closure of the airport, bus, subway, ferry and other public transport disruption.
我心里突然感到无限悲凉，这得面临多么危难的状况、需要多大的勇气才能做出如此决定，古人破釜沉舟也莫过于此。
I suddenly felt a sense of infinite sadness, this has to face a situation of distress, how much courage to make such a decision, the ancients did not burn down.
这意味着不管是否愿意，无论疫情如何蔓延，状况多么糟糕，武汉人都要为全省、全国人民做出牺牲，这才是生死考验。
This means that whether willing or not, no matter how the epidemic spread, how bad the situation, Wuhan people have to make sacrifices for the province, the whole nation, this is the test of life and death.
钟南山后来接受采访提到武汉的时候，哽咽着说“武汉是一座英雄的城市”，然后热泪盈眶，我能懂得这句话背后藏着千斤重的复杂情绪，能理解他的泪水中闪耀着的人性的光辉。
Zhong Nan Shan was interviewed when referring to Wuhan, sobbed "Wuhan is a heroic city," and then tearful eyes, I can understand the complex emotions behind this sentence, can understand his tears sparkling human glory.

从下午开始，街上的车辆、行人骤然减少，武汉有1400万人，后来周先旺市长说有500万人离开武汉。
Starting in the afternoon, the number of vehicles and pedestrians dropped sharply. Wuhan, with 14 million people, left Wuhan, the mayor said later.
我成为900万分之一，与其他留下来的人一样，按计划囤积过年物资，准备一顿丰盛的年夜饭。
I became one in nine million, and, like the others who stayed behind, hoarded New Year's Eve supplies and prepared a big New Year's dinner.
我在某个活跃度极高的群里与大家约定，鼓励除夕晚上晒年夜饭照片，隔着屏幕一起过年。
I made a pact with everyone in a very active group to encourage New Year's Eve cooking photos and celebrate New Year's Eve across the screen.
。

1月24日上午，父亲有些想念故乡的人和事，对我嘀咕说：在武汉过年一点儿年味都没有，还是老家热闹一些。
On the morning of January 24, my father thought of the people and things in his hometown and said to me: There is no such thing as Spring Festival in Wuhan.
。
.
我告诉他：今年情况特殊，病毒性肺炎厉害得很，老家人没有约束力，随意性强，并不比武汉安全。
I told him: this year's special circumstances, severe viral pneumonia, old family members are not binding, arbitrary, no safer than Wuhan.
家族群里已经打了招呼：今年统统视频拜年、电话拜年，不串门，不聚餐。
Family groups have said hello: this year all video pay New Year, telephone call, do not visit the door, do not have dinner.
。
.
父亲不太相信：隔壁刘家湾的龙灯今年总要玩吧？农村有老传统，玩龙灯要么不玩，要玩就三年玩上岸，不能中断！。
My father didn't believe it: the dragon lantern in Liu Jiawan next door is always going to play this year.There is an old tradition in the countryside.
我打断说：那更不消说得，肯定玩不成，串门儿都不行！。
"I interrupted." That's all the more true, I'm sure I can't play.
父亲又问：那怕做不到吧？那个谁家的麻将铺儿年年除夕打牌到天亮，好几桌都围满了人，他们忍得住？。
The father asked, Can't you do thatWhose mahjong shop is full of people every year on New Year's Eve playing cards?
我说：这不是儿戏！你从今天开始也不要出门打牌了。
I said, It's not a joke! You can't go out and play cards from today on.
。
.
父亲回到武汉之后，经常和小区里的老头们斗地主、打麻将，我劝了很多次都无济于事。
When my father returned to Wuhan, he often fought against the landlord and mahjong with the old people in the neighborhood.
他干了几十年村干部，享有很多年看报纸、杂志的特权，算得上村里消息灵通的权威人士。
He worked as a village cadre for decades and enjoyed the privilege of reading newspapers and magazines for many years, making him a well-informed authority in the village.
如今移动互联网时代，他不会玩手机，接受信息全靠新闻联播、湖北新闻，已经落伍于时代。
In the age of mobile Internet, he can't play mobile phone, accept information rely on news broadcast, Hubei news, has been anachronistic.
我担心他不听劝，开始给他读手机里的消息，半吓半哄。
Fearing that he would not listen, I began to read him the message on his cell phone, half frightened.
。
.
晚上七点多钟，我的微信群开始陆续有人晒年夜饭。
More than 7 pm, my micro-group began to have people bask in the New Year's Eve dinner.
突然，一位朋友晒出和家人在高速服务区吃拉面的照片，并敲出一句话：我的年夜饭。
Suddenly, a friend tanned a picture of his family eating ramen noodles in a high-speed service area and knocked out a message: My New Year's Eve meal.
我调侃这是本群最寒酸的年夜饭，他回复说：没办法，疫情严重程度超出想象，连夜带家人从浠水上高速回深圳。
I would like to point out that this is the worst dinner in the group and he replied that there is no way to deal with the problem which is more severe than expected and it is suggested that the family should take them to Shenzhen at high speed at night.
然后他私信语音告诉我：你也赶紧离开吧，听说武汉有X万人感染。
Then his private voice told me: You also hasten to leave, hear that there are X million people infected in Wuhan.
官方当天通报数字是29省（区、市）新增确诊病例444例，新增死亡患者16例。
The official figures for the same day were 444 new confirmed cases and 16 new deaths in 29 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities.
数以万计对于我来说是个天文数字，我钦佩他对家人负责的勇气，羡慕他能及时抽身，祝福他一路平安！从第二天起，湖北各城市都陆续封城，后知后觉的人心情无比沉重。
Tens of thousands of people to me is astronomical, I admire his courage to be responsible to his family, envy him to leave in time, wish him a safe journey! From the next day, Hubei cities have been closed, people feel very heavy.
。
.
这是我此生最难以下咽的一顿年夜饭。
It was the hardest New Year's dinner I could swallow in my life.
我与父亲喝了几杯酒，说了些祝福的话，谈论了2020年的家庭计划，然后忍不住翻看手机。
I had a few drinks with my father, said a few well-wishers, talked about family plans for 2020, and couldn't help looking at my mobile phone.
微信群里已经流传出各种病人得不到救治、医患关系紧张、医生心理崩溃嚎啕大哭的视频，我如鲠在喉，特别心酸。
Micromail group has spread a variety of patients do not receive treatment, tension between doctors and patients, doctor psychological breakdown wailing video, I was stuck in the throat, especially sad.
8点整，女儿期盼已久的春晚按时播出，节目越欢乐，我心里越难过，歌舞升平的场景，在人命关天的灾难面前显得特别讽刺，可又不能要求全国人民不过年。
At 8 o'clock sharp, my daughter's long-awaited Chunwan broadcast on time, the more happy the program, the more sad my heart, singing and dancing scenes, in the face of life-threatening disaster in the face of a particularly ironic, but can not ask the entire people do not.
9点多钟的时候，当我看到在疫情一线的医护人员吃泡面当年夜饭的照片，内心的悲愤无以加复，这些英雄冒着生命危险在挽救生命，后勤保障部门连一口热饭热菜都没有提供。
More than 9: 00, when I saw the front-line medical staff eating noodles as a picture of the Chinese New Year dinner, the heart of the anger can not be added, these heroes are risking their lives, logistics did not even provide a hot meal hot food.
。
.
回想起疫情期间各种糟糕的应对措施，我感慨武汉与一线城市的治理水平相距甚远，去年武汉举办了世界军运会，耗费巨资打造的繁荣一夜消散，看来我的家乡还有很长一段路要走。
Remembering the terrible measures taken during the epidemic, I lament the distance between Wuhan and the first-tier cities. Wuhan hosted the World Military Games last year, dissipating the huge spending boom and looking like my hometown has a long way to go.
。
.
这一夜特别难过，不想发朋友圈，不想写文章，不想做任何事，多少次打出的文字又全部删除。
This night is particularly sad, do not want to send friends circle, do not want to write articles, do not want to do anything, how many times the text was deleted.
这段时间，灾难面前的众生百态让我感到特别失望。
During this time, I was particularly disappointed by the variety of life in the face of disaster.
微信群里，各种平时从不发言的人开始刷屏似的散布谣言，仿佛好不容易掌握真理拿到绝密消息要彰显存在感；还有些人趁机发泄不满，把个人一整年的失落郁闷归因于社会；另一些人高举正能量大旗不让人说话，好似手握胶布随时封口。
In the small group, people who never speak usually start to spread rumors as if they have managed to grasp the truth and get top secret information to show their sense of existence. Others take the opportunity to vent their frustrations and blame society for a whole year's loss. Others hold the banner of positive energy so that no one speaks.
一切都好似无限循环，人们与以前每一次灾难中表现完全一样，除了传播介质变化，没有任何进步。
Everything seems to circulate endlessly, and people behave exactly as they have in every previous disaster, making no progress except in the medium of transmission.
我们依然缺乏坦诚担责的官员，缺乏独立思考的个体，缺乏这个时代应有的良知和温暖。
We still lack officials who are honest and responsible, individuals who are not independent thinkers, and who lack the conscience and warmth that this age deserves.
。
.
不过，也有些朋友让我钦佩、欣慰，他们平时在群里言辞犀利、仗义执言，甚至对社会现状提出批评意见，这段时期却不见踪影。
However, there are also some friends I admire, comforted, they usually in the group of sharp words, speak out, and even criticism of the social situation, but this period has disappeared.
后来我才知道，大家默默组建微信群，为家乡募集物资捐款，春节调拨的物资总数超过千万元，行胜于言，大爱无声。
Later I learned that everyone quietly set up a micro-credit group, for the home collection of material donations, Spring Festival allocates a total of more than ten million yuan, better than words, love silent.
。
.
我五味杂陈，不忍睡去，就这样坐在沙发前，像木头一样坐立到凌晨，内心比窗外的寒风还要冰凉。
I couldn't bear to sleep, so I sat on the sofa, sitting like a log until the early hours of the morning, my heart even colder than the wind outside my window.

1月25日，大年初一，早上九点，我被北京打来的电话吵醒。
On January 25th, at 9 a.m., I was woken up by a telephone call from Beijing.
原以为是哪位朋友电话拜年，结果是我在北京住宅所在的居委会打来的电话，询问我春节在哪里过、准备何时回京，叮嘱做好隔离防护。
The result was a phone call from my neighborhood committee in Beijing asking me where I would spend the Spring Festival and when I would return to Beijing.
我挺感慨，北漂十多年，终于感受到来自首都的关怀，体会到作为湖北人的特殊待遇。
I feel very sad, after more than 10 years, finally feel the concern from the capital, experience as a special treatment of Hubei people.
我扪心自问，十多年来从未给首都人民添乱，连坐地铁都是错峰出行。
I ask myself that I have never caused chaos to the people in the capital for more than a decade.
。
.
湖北人的待遇正在全所未有的恶化，微博上开始出现调侃甚至辱骂湖北人的段子、视频，与湖北交界的省市开始出现封路、断路措施，各大城市出现清查湖北人、驱逐湖北车的现象。
Hubei people's treatment is not worsening, Weibo began to ridicule and even abuse Hubei people section, video, and the border with Hubei Province began to block roads, road-cutting measures, the phenomenon of clearing Hubei people, expulsion of Hubei cars.
我心里特别愤懑，某天发了一条朋友圈：。
I was so angry that one day I had a circle of friends.
“昔日九头鸟，如今过街鼠。
"" Nine heads, now a street mouse.
。
.
我在武汉，疫灾当前，我支持全国人民防住湖北同胞。
I am in Wuhan, the current epidemic, I support the people of the whole country to prevent Hubei compatriots.
。
.
打篮球的人都知道，最好的防守是进攻。
Everyone who plays basketball knows that the best defense is offense.
。
.
湖北医护人员、普通民众正封城作战，古语云破釜沉舟也不过如此吧？。
Hubei medical personnel, ordinary people are fighting the closure of the city, the ancient saying is just like that?
举国防守，湖北进攻！。
National defense, Hubei attack!
欢迎助攻，鄙视互喷！”。
Welcome to assist, despise each other! "
初一上午，我挨个给家族长辈电话拜年，晚辈们则在微信群里互相祝福。
On the morning of the first day of junior high school, I paid a phone call to each other.
远在深圳的表弟没有回家过年，他在群里提醒亲人不要出门、注意防护，我回复他：“是的，幸好你没回来！”他回了一条：“其实心里很遗憾，出这种事的时候，没和父母在一起。
My cousin, who was in Shenzhen, didn't come home for the New Year. He reminded his family not to go out and pay attention to the protection. "Yes, fortunately you didn't come back," he replied.
”我不知如何回复才好，想起前几天在高铁遇到的误车返京的年轻人，以及被我误认为抢座的母亲之子，如果这个春节他们都没有和父母在一起，会不会懊悔遗憾？。
I don't know how to reply, and remember the young people who missed the bus to Beijing the other day and the son of my mother, whom I mistook for a seat, whether they would regret not being with their parents for the Spring Festival?
1月26日上午，初二，我开始在公司群里部署远程办公的规章制度，并作出2月份不降薪、不裁员、不打卡、不坐班的承诺，鼓励大家呆在所在城市不要折腾，宅在家里开始工作。
On the morning of January 26, I began to deploy telecommuting rules and regulations in my company, and made a commitment not to cut wages, lay off workers, or punch or work in February, encouraging everyone to stay in the city and start working from home.
为此，我调整了2020年公司薪酬考核体系和激励机制，总体原则是员工收入比2019年增长30%以上。
To this end, I adjusted the 2020 pay assessment system and incentive mechanism, the overall principle is that staff income than 2019 to increase by more than 30%.
四天之后，公司开始以网络办公、电话会议的方式正常运转，每个人精神饱满的投入工作，共克时艰，当我看到每个熟悉的名字背后传来熟悉的声音，心里感动而温暖。
Four days later, the company began to operate as a network office, teleconference, everyone energetic to work, difficult times together, when I saw each familiar name behind the familiar voice, moved and warm.
全公司除了我在武汉之外，其他人都不在湖北，有些人已提前返京，抢着跑到办公室去浇花，然后在群里询问：是不是谁已经浇过水了？花盆湿润，花开正艳。
The whole company except me in Wuhan is not in Hubei, some people have returned to Beijing early, rushed to the office to water the flowers, and then asked in the group: Who has watered the water? The flower pot is wet and the flowers are blooming beautifully.
。
.
正如我所担心的那样，老家黄冈疫情日渐严峻，逐步扩散成仅次于武汉的第二严重城市。
As I feared, the Hwanggang outbreak in my hometown became more serious and gradually spread to the second worst city after Wuhan.
微信群里，依然可以看到老乡们串门拜年、打牌聚餐的视频，武汉人有“不服周”“不信邪”的口头禅，意思是老子天下第一，褒义来看具有敢为人先、勇争第一的精神，这次在疫情面前却吃尽苦头。
In the micro-letter group, you can still see the villagers visiting the New Year, playing cards to have dinner video, Wuhan people "do not believe in the week," "do not believe in evil," which means that the world first, praise has a bold, courageous first spirit, this time in the face of the epidemic.
我的家乡浠水是闻一多的故乡，骨头硬、脾气倔，不然也不会有拍案而起的《最后一次演讲》，比武汉人有过之而无不及，再加上经济落后、医疗资源匮乏，情况特别糟糕。
It is indicated that it is believed that it is difficult to understand these signs and it is believed that it is difficult to understand these signs. It is believed that it is difficult to understand these signs.
我心想，国难当头，无处可逃，也无需逃。
My country, I thought, had nowhere to flee and no escape.
。
.
比疫情更糟糕的是家乡官员的表现，省长开发布会连续三次念错数据，省委书记答记者问答非所问自说自话，市卫计委唐主任面对督导组一问三不知丑态百出，就连家乡退休干部写的一首赞美诗，都被自媒体大号讽刺调侃到百万+阅读量。
Worse than the epidemic is the performance of home town officials, the governor held a press conference three times in a row read wrong data, the provincial party secretary answered questions and asked their own questions, director Tang Wei and Planning Commission in the face of the advisory team, even wrote a hymn, home retired cadres have been from the media ridiculed to million + reading.
。
.
父亲当然看不到这些网络信息，他无聊的时候就给老家亲戚朋友打电话，当听说大家还在打牌、拜年的时候，心里痒得不得了。
When he was bored, he called his relatives and friends back home. When he heard that everyone was still playing cards and visiting the New Year, his heart ached.
初六下午，他独自出门，半天未归，也没有带手机，我心里又急又气，到晚上六点多他回家吃饭，才不好意思开口说“和几个老头儿打牌去了”我忍不住对他高声吼了半天，批评他拿一家老小的生命安危当儿戏。
In the afternoon of the sixth day, he went out alone, did not come home half a day, and did not bring a cell phone, I was anxious and angry, until more than 6 pm, he came home to dinner, he said, "played cards with some old people.
他默不作声，我有些自责，还是平时跟他聊天少了，于是把家里电视机刷剧调成《乡村爱情》模式。
He was silent, I a little remorse, or the usual chat with him less, so the family TV brushstroke into "country love" mode.
。
.
还是有一些事情让我感到温暖，比如我在朋友圈、公众号里欣喜发现，我服务过的企业客户华润、招商局、美的、戴尔中国、卓尔等纷纷对湖北解囊相助，心里充满感激之情。
There are still some things I feel warm about, such as in the circle of friends, the public rejoicing in the public, I have served customers such as China Resources, Merchants Bureau, the United States, Dell China, drow, and so on to Hubei to help, full of gratitude.
尤其是当得知16省市一省包一市对口支援湖北，山东省对口黄冈市，山东人民以“抄家式”的爱心驰援家乡黄冈，我内心有一种莫名的自我感动。
Especially when I learned that 16 provinces and municipalities Baoyi city counterpart support Hubei, Shandong Province counterpart Huanggang City, Shandong Province, the people of Shandong Province with "family-oriented" love to help his hometown Huanggang, I have an inexplicable self-touched.
过去一年，我带领作家团队为三家山东企业写企业史，超过一半的时间都在山东驻扎或出差，这大概是冥冥中的缘分，未来更应当全力回报鲁商，奉献山东！。
Over the past year, I have led a team of writers to write a corporate history for three Shandong enterprises. Over half of the time, I have been stationed or traveling in Shandong Province.
在这里应当特别提及卓尔董事长、湖北首富阎志。
Special mention should be made of Chairman Zhuo here, Hubei first rich Yan Zhi.
阎总也是我们黄冈人，2014年因写作卓尔企业史结缘，2019年3月《卓尔的故事：中国民营企业发展和转型样本》出版。
Yan Zong is also a native of Huanggang. In 2014, he published Tales of Zhuo: A Sample of the Development and Transformation of Private Enterprises in China.
2020年新冠病毒疫情期间，他用短短6天时间在全球采购了300万个医用口罩、30万只N95口罩、近30万件防护服、32000副护目镜，用4架专机运回武汉。
During the 2020 outbreak of the new crown virus, he purchased three million medical masks, 300,000 N95 masks, nearly 300,000 protective suits and 32,000 goggles globally in just six days and transported them back to Wuhan in four special planes.
我知道他已将部分物资捐献给家乡黄冈，但仍然在2月1日微信请求他支援我的老家浠水，一天之后，他回复说：“上次送了些急需物资到浠水，今天再送1台呼吸机、口罩10000个。
It is my understanding that some of these items have already been donated to these sheepsheads but it is still indicated in my letter of 1 February that he would like to support them. A day later it is indicated that it is suggested that some of these items should be sent to these area
”。
"
还有一位素未谋面的家乡孤寡老人让我感动落泪。
I was also moved to tears by a lonely old man from home I had never met.
前几天，在北京的浠水老乡组织捐款，准备购买一批医疗急缺物资送回老家的医院。
It is indicated that some days ago it is proposed to purchase a lot of medical emergency supplies to the hospital at these locations.
一位名叫艾木球的老大爷在老家听村干部说起这件事，专门打电话给北京的组织者之一毕缩启要求捐款。
In his hometown, an old man named Emu Qiu listened to the village cadre talking about this matter, and called one of the organizers in Beijing to abridge his appeal for money.
毕缩启有心，用电话录下这段乡音对话：。
Bi Shu-qi has the heart to record this vernacular dialogue by telephone.
简短了解情况之后，毕缩启问：老哥儿，你准备捐几多儿？。
After a brief understanding of the situation, Bidding asked: old brother, how much you are ready to donate?
艾木球答：我准备交1000块钱，用微信转给你。
Kimball A: I'm going to pay you a thousand dollars by a microphone.
。
.
毕缩启心疼道：唉呢！老哥呢！你自家也缺钱，把钱留到，莫都捐了。
Bi Shu Kai heartache way: Alas! Old brother! You also lack of money at home, to save the money, do not donate.
。
.
艾木球脱口而出：国家有我，我有国家。
Aiki ball blurt out: the country has me, I have the country.
国家有难，匹夫有责。
A nation in need is a duty.
这没有办法。
There is no way.
。
.
毕缩启有点哽咽：老哥，我很感动啊老哥！。
Bi shrinks open a bit choking: Brother, I am very moved ah brother!
艾木球说：我看到电视在播，我心里好酸啊！。
Emu Ball said: I saw the TV broadcast, I feel very sad!
毕缩启：谢谢啊老哥！我眼泪要出来了！。
Bi Shu Kai: Thank you, brother! My tears are coming out!
这就是我们可爱的家乡人，一位不顾自身处境为国解难的孤寡老人。
This is our dear country man, a lonely old man who has no regard for his own situation.
与某些达官显贵相比，我们很容易分得清谁高贵、谁卑贱。
It is easy to tell who is noble and who is mean when compared with some dignities.
民心是最大的政治，正义是最强的力量。
The heart of the people is the greatest politics, justice is the strongest force.
有这样的人民，国家怎能不强大，病毒何愁不消散？。
With such a people, how can the country not strong, the virus does not dissipate?

2月2日，按照原计划我本该乘高铁返回北京工作。
On February 2, I was supposed to take the high-speed train back to work in Beijing.
可如今高铁、飞机已经停运，而且恢复的日子遥遥无期。
But now high-speed rail, aircraft have been shut down, and the days of recovery are far from over.
一些赶在封城之前离开湖北的朋友，开始在微信群交流隔离日常，在朋友圈分享隔离故事，每个人都不容易，逃离的结果是无法逃离，只是换一座城市重新面对。
Some of the friends who left Hubei before the closure of the city began to share the isolation of daily communication in the micro-group, sharing the isolation story in the circle of friends, everyone is not easy to escape, the result is not escape, just another city to face.
。
.
每天清晨醒来第一件事，就是查看全国、湖北、武汉、黄冈、浠水的新增病例、死亡病例、治愈病例的情况，枯燥的数据写满悲伤，每一个数据背后都意味着一个生命的生死存亡，一个家庭的悲欢离合，还有为之全力以赴的医护工作者的福寿安康，牵动着亿万颗国人的心。
The first thing I have to do every morning is to look at the new cases, the death cases and the cases which are cured in these area in China, Hubei, Wuhan, Huanggang and these sheepshead that behind each data is meant the life and death of a life, the joys and sorrows of a family and the well-being of the health care workers who devote themselves to it and affect the heart of millions of people.
武汉女作家方方说：“时代的一粒灰，落在个人那里，可能就是一座山。
Wuhan woman writer Fang Fang said: "A gray of the times, fell on the individual there, may be a mountain.

别说一座山，就算是新冠病毒疫情的一粒灰尘，就足以让整个家庭寝食难安。
Not to mention a mountain, even a new crown virus outbreak of dust, it is enough to make the whole family sleep difficult.

2月5日下午，妻子开始低烧，在37-37.6度之间徘徊。
In the afternoon of 5 February, the wife began to suffer from a low fever, hovering between 37 and 37.6 degrees.
发烧之前，她曾戴口罩到楼下取快递，到超市拿蔬菜。
Before the fever, she used to wear a mask downstairs to pick up express delivery, to the supermarket to pick up vegetables.

父母惶恐不安，甚至有些埋怨：怎么办？叫你平时多穿衣服不听话！。
Parents are apprehensive, even some complain: How to do? Make you usually wear more clothes disobedient!
妻子有些茫然：要不要打电话给居委会，需不需要自我隔离起来？。
Wife is a bit at a loss: Should I call the neighborhood committee, or do I need to isolate myself?
我也担心，但宽慰说：先观察，明天再说，毕竟除了你，家人都没事。
I was worried too, but comforted, I said, Watch first and talk about it tomorrow. After all, my family is all right except you.

那天晚上，一家人草草吃晚饭，早早入睡，心里忐忑不安。
That night, the family hurried to supper and went to sleep early, uneasy.

2月6日早上，她开始拉肚子，并且感觉浑身酸痛，然后百度搜索各种新冠病毒症状，越看越惊慌。
On the morning of February 6, she began to pull her tummy and feel sore all over. Then Baidu searched for symptoms of the new crown virus.
我认为有必要去医院看看，她就开始联系居委会、社区、物业，并未收到有效答复。
I think it is necessary to go to the hospital, she began to contact neighborhood, community, property, did not receive effective response.
因为家附近的湖北省人民医院东院已成为新冠肺炎病人定点医院，我们只好驾车前往1.3公里外的社区医院。
As the East Hospital of the Hubei Provincial People's Hospital near our home has become the designated hospital for patients with pneumonia, we had to drive 1.3 kilometers away to the community hospital.

天空飘着细雨，春风透着冬寒，街上见不到人，也很少有车。
The sky was drizzling with rain, the spring breeze was cold in winter, there was no one in the street and there were few cars.
我们慢慢前行，从未觉得道路如此宽广，内心也从未这样孤单绝望。
We walked slowly, never feeling so wide a path, never so lonely and hopeless inside.
我已经快十天没有出小区门了，仿佛有一个世纪那么长，满眼都物是人非，我好怀念堵车的日子，想看到一群不守规则的人闯红灯“中国式过马路”，想听到没有素质的市民用武汉腔骂一句“个斑马养的”。
I have not been out of the community door for nearly 10 days, as if a century long, full of things are wrong, I miss the days of traffic jams, want to see a group of people breaking the red light "Chinese Style Crossing the Road," want to hear unqualified citizens scold a "zebra."
。
.
武汉从没有像今天这么安静过。
Wuhan has never been so quiet as it is today.
从2002年9月初识武汉，我印象中这座城市就像个脾气火爆、作风干练、心直口快、喜欢热闹的疯丫头，如果突然静下来，肯定会有一场天翻地覆的大爆发。
When I first met Wuhan in September 2002, I had the impression that the city looked like a hot-tempered, efficient, outspoken, enthusiastic wench, and that if it suddenly fell silent, there would be a major upheaval.
如今，她生了一场大病，只能安静疗伤，沉淀过往，病愈之后，一定会迎来胜过往日的俏丽模样。
Now, she had a serious illness, can only quietly heal wounds, precipitation of the past, recovery, will certainly usher in a more beautiful than usual.
。
.
妻子也是一位生病的姑娘，发着低烧，我倒希望她是一场感冒。
My wife is also a sick girl with a low fever. I wish she had a cold.
。
.
我们从未去过社区医院，人不算多，医务人员都穿着防护服，戴着护目镜和口罩。
We have never been to a community hospital, not many people, medical staff wearing protective clothing, goggles and masks.
我们先在门口外详细登记住址、身份证号、手机号和家庭每个人的姓名，并且用温度计测体温。
We checked in details outside the door for addresses, identity numbers, cell phone numbers and the names of everyone in the family, and thermometers were used to measure body temperature.
随后再到分诊台领病历本，就直接前往发热门诊，查血、拍肺部CT，之后就进入漫长等待。
Then go to the clinic to receive medical records, go directly to the fever clinic, blood examination, pulmonary CT, and then enter a long wait.
。
.
大厅的长椅上分散坐着十来个病患及家属，每个人都焦虑紧张，空气中弥漫着消毒水的味道，每一声咳嗽都仿佛释放魔咒，令人生畏。
On the benches in the hall sat a dozen patients and their families, each anxious and tense, the smell of disinfectant in the air, and every cough seemed a formidable release of the spell.
。
.
没过多久，我们拿到血常规化验单，数据基本正常。
Before long, we got the routine laboratory tests and the data were basically normal.
可是CT片却迟迟拿不到，比我们晚到的人都陆续离开，时间越拖一分钟，我的不安和恐惧就增加一分。
But the CT was slow to arrive, and as those who arrived later continued to leave, the longer it took me a minute, the more anxious and fearful I became.
。
.
期间，父亲不停打电话，问有没有拿到诊断结果。
In the meantime, my father kept calling and asked if he had received the diagnosis.
。
.
终于，一名医生拿着片子轻声问我：是不是XX家属？。
Finally, a doctor took the film quietly asked me: is it XX family?
我内心一阵狂跳，特别紧张。
I was in a frenzy of nervous excitement.
。
.
他举起片子对着灯光左看右看，然后说：没事，很正常。
He held it up, looked left and right at the light, and then said, It's okay. It's normal.
。
.
我们如释重负，长舒一口气。
We heaved a sigh of relief.
。
.
医生建议开一些清热解毒的中药，因为家里有，我们就没有抓药。
The doctor suggests some Chinese medicine for antipyretic and detoxification, because we have it at home, we have no medicine.
。
.
走出社区医院大门，抬头就可以看到不远处的高架桥，这是京广高铁干线。
Out of the door of the community hospital, can be seen not far from the viaduct, this is the Beijing-Guangzhou high-speed rail trunk line.
。
.
就在此时，一辆高铁轰隆隆呼啸而过，由远及近，由近及远，与往常相比没有任何减速。
Just then, a high-speed train roared past, far and near, near and far, without any slowdown compared to the usual.
。
.
我停下脚步，站在原地，静静的看着铁路高架桥。
I stopped and stood still, looking at the railway viaduct.
。
.
那一刻，我内心澎湃，眼眶湿润。
At that moment, my heart surged and my eyes were moist.
。
.
这是我在武汉见过的最美的风景，这是我心中难忘的瞬间。
This is the most beautiful scenery I have ever seen in Wuhan. It is an unforgettable moment in my heart.
。
.
20多天之前，我就是乘坐这条干线上的G517回到武汉。
More than 20 days ago, I took the G517 on this main road back to Wuhan.
过去一年，甚至此前这么多年，我坐过几百趟高铁，许多次看到高铁从站台前呼啸而来，又风驰而去，却从未有今天这样壮观。
In the past year, or so many years before, I have taken hundreds of high-speed rail journeys, and many times I have seen them roar in front of them and wind them away, but never before have they been so spectacular.
。
.
这才是我熟悉的中国，这才是我身处的时代。
This is the China I know, and this is the time I live in.
这才是中国应有的动力，这才是时代真实的声音。
That is what China should be motivated to do, and that is the true voice of the times.
。
.
历史的车轮滚滚向前，没有任何疫情灾难、困境苦难能够阻挡中国前进的步伐。
The wheels of history are rolling forward, and no epidemic disaster or hardship can stop China's advance.
。
.
自然的规律循序展开，没有一个冬天不会远去，没有一个春天不会来临。
The law of nature unfolds in sequence, and no winter goes far, nor spring does not come.
