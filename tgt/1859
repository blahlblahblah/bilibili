中国科学院西双版纳热带植物园网站2019年12月在湖北武汉爆发了一种新型冠状病毒（SARS-CoV-2）所致的肺炎（现称COVID-19），新型冠状病毒爆发已两个多月，确定华南海鲜市场是不是唯一的发源地，对于寻找病毒的来源，以及确定中间宿主，对疫情的控制和避免再次爆发具有至关重要的意义。
More than two months after the outbreak of a new coronavirus (now known as COVID-19) in Wuhan, Hubei Province, the new coronavirus outbreak has been underway for more than two months to determine whether the South China seafood market is the only place of origin.
中国科学院西双版纳热带植物园联合华南农业大学和北京脑科中心的科研人员一起收集了全世界各领域共享到GISAID EpiFluTM数据库中覆盖了四大洲12个国家的93个新型冠状病毒样本的基因组数据（截止2月12日），通过全基因组数据解析，追溯传染源及扩散路径。
Researchers from the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, together with researchers from the South China Agricultural University and Beijing Brain Center, collected genomic data (as of February 12) from 93 new coronavirus samples shared worldwide in 12 countries covering four continents, tracing the source of infection and spread pathways through genome-wide data analysis.
研究发现，收到的93个样本包含58种单倍型，可以归纳为五组，包括3个古老超级传播者单倍型（H1,H3和H13）和2个新的超级传播者单倍型（H56和mv2）；华南海鲜市场的新型冠状病毒是从其他地方传入进来，在市场中发生快速传播蔓延到市场之外；同时，现扩散的病例至少来自于3个途经。
The study found that the 93 samples received contained 58 haplotypes, which can be grouped into five groups, including three old super disseminators haploid (H1, H3 and H13) and two new super-disseminators haplotypes (H56 and mv2); new coronavirus from the South China seafood market was introduced from elsewhere and spread rapidly beyond the market; and the current spread of cases came from at least three routes.
新型冠状病毒在2月12日之前发生过2次明显的种群扩张（分别是12月8日和1月6日）。
The coronavirus showed two distinct population expansion before February 12 (December 8 and January 6, respectively).
华南海鲜市场的新型冠状病毒是从其他地方传入的基于120个变异位点得到58种单倍型（基因类型），单倍型演化关系显示，单倍型H13和H38是比较“古老的”单倍型，通过一个中间载体（mv1，可能是一个祖先单倍型，可能是来自中间宿主或者“零号病人”）与蝙蝠冠状病毒RaTG13关联，并通过单倍型H3衍生出了单倍型H1。
The new coronavirus in the South China Seafood Market obtained 58 monoploid (genotypes) based on 120 variants from other places. The haploid evolution relationship shows that haploid H13 and H38 are relatively "old" haplotypes associated with the bat coronavirus RTG13 through an intermediate carrier (mv1, possibly an ancestral haplotype, possibly from an intermediate host or "patient zero").
与华南海鲜市场有关联的患者样品单倍型都是H1及其衍生的单倍型H2，H8-H12，而一份武汉样品单倍型H3与华南海鲜市场无关。
The haplotypes of patients associated with the South China seafood market are H1 and its derived haplotypes H2, H8-H12, while a Wuhan sample haplotype H3 has nothing to do with the South China seafood market.
可见，华南海鲜市场的新型冠状病毒是从其他地方传入进来，在市场中发生快速传播蔓延到市场之外。
It can be seen that the new coronavirus from the South China seafood market has been introduced into the market and spread beyond the market.
另外，根据病患发病时间记录和种群扩张时间推断，也印证了华南海鲜市场不是病毒发源地的推论。
In addition, the inference that the South China seafood market is not the source of the virus is confirmed by the time history of the disease and the time of population expansion.
对“古老的”单倍型H13和H38的病毒样品溯源发现分别是来自深圳的病患（广东首例）和美国华盛顿州的病患（美国首例）。
Virus samples from the "old" haploid H13 and H38 were traced to patients from Shenzhen (the first in Guangdong) and Washington State (the first in the United States).
他们的旅行记录表明应该都是2019年12月底至2020年1月初在武汉探亲期间被感染的。
Their travel records indicate that they should have been infected during their family visit in Wuhan between the end of December 2019 and the beginning of January 2020.
现有武汉样本中没有检测到H13和H38单倍型，可能是因为现有样品主要采自几家定点医院，而且样品采集时间局限于2019年12月24日和2020年1月5日。
H13 and H38 haplotypes were not detected in the existing Wuhan samples, possibly because the available samples were taken mainly from selected hospitals and samples were collected only on 24 December 2019 and 5 January 2020.
如果能在武汉其他医院早期的病患检测到这两种单倍型，将对于寻找病毒来源非常有帮助。
If these two haplotypes can be detected in early patients in other Wuhan hospitals, it will be very helpful to find the source of the virus.
新型冠状病毒在2月12日之前发生过2次明显的种群扩张根据新型冠状病毒基因组数据推算1月之前的种群扩张发生时间是12月8日，该结果暗示病毒可能在12月初，甚至11月下旬即已经开始有人际传播，随后在华南海鲜市场加快了人际传播（图2）。
The new coronavirus experienced two major population expansions before Feb. 12, extrapolating pre-January population expansion to December 8 based on new coronavirus genome data, suggesting that human-to-human transmission of the virus could have begun in early December or even late November, followed by accelerated human-to-human transmission in the South China seafood market (figure 2).
研究推算2月份之前的种群扩张时间在1月6日，这个可能与元旦假期有关联。
The study extrapolated population expansion to January 6, possibly linked to the New Year's holiday.
需要指出，这一天国家疾控中心发布了2级应急响应。
It should be noted that the National CDC issued a Level 2 emergency response on that day.
当时的预警起到了一些警示作用，公众活动和出行都有所减少。
Early warnings served as a wake-up call, with fewer public events and fewer trips.
如果当时的警示能引起大众更广泛的重视，那么1月份中下旬向全国和全球蔓延的病例会有所降低。
If the warnings had been more widely heeded, there would have been a reduction in the number of cases that spread nationally and globally in late January.
研究人员进一步确认我国其他9个省区和其他11个国家的感染病例基本都是从武汉直接或者间接输入而来。
The researchers further confirmed that nine other provinces and regions and 11 other countries in the country's infection cases are basically from Wuhan direct or indirect input.
现扩散的病例至少来自于3个途径为了能够细分来源，研究人员将58种单倍型分成了五组，采用标准是3个中心（古老超级传播者）单倍型（H1,H3和H13）和2个新的超级传播者单倍型（H56和mv2）。
In order to be able to subdivide the sources, the researchers divided the 58 haplotypes into five groups, using a standard of three (old super-disseminators) haplotypes (H1, H3 and H13) and two new super-disseminators (H56 and mv2).
以此鉴别出广东的病毒可能有三个来源，重庆和台湾的病毒有两个来源。
This identified three possible sources of the virus in Guangdong, Chongqing and Taiwan from two sources.
其中，广东深圳一家人在早期就通过人传人进行了传播。
Among them, Guangdong Shenzhen family carried on the transmission through the person-to-person early.
有较多样本的澳大利亚、法国、日本和美国，他们的患者感染源至少有两个，尤其是美国包括了五个来源。
In Australia, France, Japan and the United States, which have more diversified versions, there are at least two sources of infection, particularly in the United States, which includes five sources.
非常值得关注的是H56这个超级传播者单倍型，它同时是澳大利亚、法国和美国，以及我国台湾患者的传染源。
Of great concern is H56, the super-spreader haplotype, which is a source of infection for patients in Australia, France and the United States, as well as in my own country, Taiwan.
其他国家患者因为样品比较少，大多数的来源比较单一，他们除了是武汉旅游输入或在武汉感染外，有一些人可能是在广东、新加坡等地被感染。
Other countries because of the relatively small number of samples, most of the sources are relatively simple, in addition to Wuhan tourism input or infection in Wuhan, some people may be in Guangdong, Singapore and other places infected.
新型冠状病毒基因组尚未发生重组事件研究人员发现新型冠状病毒基因组没有发生重组事件，93个基因组之间有120核苷酸发生了突变（0.41%序列长度），并均匀分散在10个编码区（χ2=1.958, df=9, P=0.99）。
No recombination of coronavirus genomes Researchers found no recombination of the coronavirus genome, 120 nucleotides mutated between 93 genomes (0.41% sequence length) and spread evenly across 10 coding regions (2 = 1.958, df = 9, P = 0.99).
120个突变的核苷酸关联了119个氨基酸密码子，其中79个密码子 (65.83%)改变了氨基酸类型，并有42个(53.17%)氨基酸理化性质都被改变（图3）。
Of the 120 mutated nucleotides associated with 119 amino acid codon, 79 (65.83%) changed the amino acid type and 42 (53.17%) the physicochemical properties of the amino acids were changed (Fig. 3).
这些氨基酸类型以及理化性质改变是否会影响新型冠状病毒的活性暂不清楚，需要其他蛋白组学和结构生物学方面的专业人士进行验证。
Whether these amino acid types and changes in physicochemical properties will affect the activity of the new coronavirus remains unclear and needs to be validated by other proteomics and structural biology professionals.
本研究是版纳植物园综合保护中心生物多样性研究组的科研人员利用其在系统与演化领域的专长开展的，本研究提到单倍型演化关系分析方法可以结合到传染病学研究中，对于寻找传染源，以及精确的传播和扩散方向能提供非常重要的信息。
The study was conducted by researchers of the Biodiversity Research Group of the Banna Botanical Gardens Integrated Conservation Center, using their expertise in the field of systems and evolution. The study mentioned that the haplotype evolutionary relationship analysis method can be integrated into the epidemiology of infectious diseases and can provide very important information for finding the source of infection and for accurate propagation and dispersal direction.
