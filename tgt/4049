记者/李佳楠编辑/石爱华 宋建华河南援鄂医疗队在武汉市第四医院古田院区前在武汉市第四医院古田院区上岗的第一天，河南首批援鄂医疗队的护士贾晓阳，就参与料理一位新冠肺炎病人的遗体，“是一位原本可以安享晚年的老人。
Journalist / Li Jia Nan Editor / Shi Ai Hua Song Jianhua Henan Medical Team was involved in the care of the corpse of a newly-crowned pneumonia patient on the first day of duty in Gutian courtyard area of Wuhan Fourth Hospital in front of the Gutian courtyard district of Wuhan City's Fourth Hospital.
” 她和同事帮老人整理好衣服，出门前，俯身向老人遗体鞠躬告别。
She and her workmates helped the old man tidy up his clothes, went out and bowed goodbye to the old man's body.
截至3月20日，全国共有3253人因新冠肺炎死亡。
As of March 20, 3,253 people nationwide had died from pneumonia.
对于“外面的人”来说，患者“死亡”的结果，是疫情发布里的一个数字，而在病区里面，贾晓阳和同事不得不经历病人慢慢离开的过程。
For "outsiders," the result of the patient's "death" is a figure in the release of the outbreak, while in the sick area, Jia and his colleagues have to go through a slow-moving process.
他们要在裹尸袋上反复标注逝者的姓名、年龄，以便告诉外面的人“逝者是谁”；要迎接同房病友慌张的眼神，为他们留一盏灯，鼓励病人“不要太担心”；他们不得不成为“死亡消息”的传递者，面对外面苦苦等待的家属，却无法促成双方的最后一面。
They repeatedly mark the names and ages of the dead on the shroud in order to tell the outside world "who is dead"; greet the flurried eyes of fellow patients with a light to encourage them to "don't worry too much"; they have to act as transmitters of "death news" to their families waiting outside, but not to the last side of either side.
病区走廊的尽头，一间偏僻的病房被用来临时安放病人的遗体30分钟，送她最后一程1月26日，河南首批援鄂医疗队抵达武汉，在137人的队伍中，贾晓阳是一名护理经验刚满一年的护士。
At the end of the corridor in the sick area, a remote ward was used to temporarily place the patient's body for 30 minutes. On January 26, the first medical team from Henan Province arrived in Wuhan.
第三天，医疗队入驻武汉市第四医院，先后接管了三个重症患者救治病区。
On the third day, the medical team was admitted to Wuhan Fourth Hospital and took over three seriously ill patients.
在病区走廊的尽头，一间位置偏僻的病房被临时改造，用来暂时安放病人遗体。
At the end of the corridor, a secluded ward was temporarily adapted to house the patient's body.
为避免病人误入，房门上着锁。
The door was locked to prevent the patient from straying in.
只有“坏消息”传来时，门才会被打开。
The door will not be opened until "bad news" comes through.
贾晓阳没想到，上岗的第一天，就要面对“坏消息”。
Jia Xiaoyang did not expect that the first day of duty, will face "bad news."
那天，临近交接班，她正准备背起几十斤的消毒液对病房进行消杀，一位老人突然去世了。
That day, near the hand-over shift, she was ready to carry dozens of jin of disinfectant to the ward, an old man died suddenly.
因病房构造问题，病床无法直接推出房门，四名医护人员只能用床单将逝者抬出，贾晓阳26岁，在组内最年轻，她替换下一位同事，帮忙把遗体运到走廊尽头的房间。
As the hospital bed could not be moved directly out of the hospital room due to structural problems, the four paramedics had to use bed sheets to remove the deceased. At the age of 26, the youngest member of the group, Jia replaced her next colleague and helped transport the body to the room at the end of the corridor.
房门打开时，一具已妥善处理的病人遗体正对着门口，橘色的装尸袋上写着“奠”字，“虽然已被告知有遗体存放，但出现在眼前时，还是把目光赶紧移开了。
When the door opened, the body of a properly handled patient was facing the door, and the orange bag had the word "Dien" written on it.
”贾晓阳和另一名更有经验的护士留下来整理遗体。
"Jia and another more experienced nurse stayed behind to tidy up the body.
房间没开灯，只有外面的光照进来，有些昏暗，戴着手套，贾晓阳感觉指尖凉凉的。
The room did not turn on the light, only the outside light came in, some dark, wearing gloves, Jia Xiaoyang felt cool fingertips.
在医疗队的工作手册里，死亡患者的处理流程分为六个步骤：确定死亡时间、通知家属、向医务处上报、护士进行遗体消杀包裹、通知保卫处，最后对遗体停放位置及床单位置做终末处理。
In the medical team's workbook, there are six steps in the process of treating a deceased patient: determining the time of death, notifying the family, reporting to the medical services, performing the decontamination of the body by the nurse, notifying the guard office and, finally, the final disposal of the location of the body and the bed linen.
对患者遗体进行消杀时，要用消毒液浸泡过的棉球、纱布，对遗体的口、鼻、耳等开放性通道进行填塞，再对全身进行擦拭。
When the patient's body is sterilized, use disinfectant soaked cotton ball, gauze, the body's mouth, nose, ears and other open channels to fill, and then wipe the whole body.
做完消杀后，把病人的衣服穿好，调整到仰卧的体位，整理好遗容，用双层床单包裹遗体，最后放进装尸袋。
After the elimination, the patient's clothes, adjust to the position lying on the back, tidy up the body, with a double sheet wrapped body, and finally put into the body bag.
按照要求，从病人确定死亡开始，所有步骤要在30分钟内完成。
As required, all steps are completed within 30 minutes from the time the patient determines death.
那天，贾晓阳和同事配合，给那位去世的老人擦拭遗体。
That day, Jia Xiaoyang cooperated with his colleagues to wipe the dead old man's body.
她还记得，这位七八十岁的老奶奶留着齐肩短发，此前老人病情已经危重，身体一直很虚弱。
She remembered that the eighty-eight-year-old granny had short shoulder-length hair, and that the old man had been critically ill and weak.
离开前，老人呼吸费力，最终因缺氧抢救无效去世。
Before leaving, the old man breathed laboriously and died of lack of oxygen.
援鄂前，贾晓阳在河南新乡医学院一附院（以下简称新乡一附院）结核病科已工作一年多，也经历过病人抢救无效去世的情况，“撤掉所有的仪器后，家属会为逝者穿上备好的寿衣，病人能干干净净、体面地离开。
Before helping Hubei, Jia Xiaoyang has been working for more than a year in a hospital attached to Xinxiang Medical School in Henan Province. He has also experienced cases of invalid patients dying. After removing all the equipment, the family will put on the ready-made shroud and the patients will leave in a clean and dignified manner
”但在疫区医院，是不许家属探视和陪护的，直至老人去世前，都没能见到家人最后一面。
But family visits and escorts were not allowed until after the old man's death.
贾晓阳和同事只能在有限的时间里，尽可能帮老人整理好仪容，送她最后一程。
Jia and her colleagues can only in a limited time, as much as possible to help the elderly tidy up, send her a final ride.
为了方便辨认遗体，她们在装尸袋多处写上老人的姓名、性别、年龄等信息。
To facilitate the identification of the body, the bags were filled with the names of the elderly, gender, age and other information.
由于疫情前期情况严峻，处理好的遗体，只能暂放在房间，排队等着殡仪馆的人员来运送。
Due to the severe pre-epidemic situation, the disposed remains can only be temporarily placed in the room, waiting for the funeral parlour personnel to transport.
离开前，贾晓阳和同事俯身，向老人鞠了一躬，做了最后的告别。
Before leaving, Jia and his colleagues bowed to the old man and made a final farewell.
除了贵重的物品在消杀后会留给家属，死者使用过的床单被罩及生活用品，会在半小时内被清理掉，但贾晓阳说：“我可能永远也忘不了她。
"I will probably never forget her," he said, except that valuable items will be left to family members after they have been eliminated and bedclothes and household items used by the deceased will be removed within half an hour.
”贾晓阳在病区进行消杀工作猝不及防的死亡消息第一天下班，回到一个人的酒店，贾晓阳情绪低落，她感到无能为力。
"Jia Xiaoyang came home from work on the first day of news of her death in the sick area and returned to her hotel.
她逼着自己不去想，把电视音量开到最大，翻看手机打发时间，直到困得眼皮打架，才昏沉沉睡去。
Forcing herself not to think, she turned the TV up to its full volume and passed the time on her cell phone until she was too sleepy to fall asleep.
贾晓阳努力调整自己不被情绪干扰，她知道，自己每天面临着被感染的风险，压力过大，免疫力降低，只会增加这种风险。
As Jia tries to adjust to her emotions, she knows that she faces a daily risk of infection, which can only be increased by excessive stress and reduced immunity.
但常在病区里工作，医护人员的情绪很难不随着病人的情况有所起伏，尤其是死亡发生时。
But often working in a sick area, it is difficult for health care workers not to fluctuate with the patient's condition, especially when death occurs.
二月中旬，病区已陆续有病人出院。
In mid-February, patients were discharged from the affected areas.
贾晓阳记得，一位老先生入院后发烧症状消失，“每天乐呵呵的，躺得久了，就坐在凳子上输液，有时还会在病房散步”。
Jia remembered that an old man went into hospital with a fever and disappeared. "Everyday he was in a good mood, lying down for a long time, infusion on the stool and sometimes walking in the ward."
可一天晚上，老人突然开始高烧，第二天再上班时，老人已经走了，所有的同事得知消息都又惊讶又难过，“大家都认为他快出院了。
But one night the old man had a high fever and by the time he returned to work the next day the old man had gone.
”新乡一附院的护士刘玲已有10多年的工作经验。
Liu Ling, a nurse with a subsidiary in Xinxiang, has more than 10 years of experience.
据她所知，新乡一附院援鄂医护人员的平均年龄只有33岁，年轻人承担起病区大部分工作，在她眼里，这些刚步入工作不久的同事“都是孩子”，以前，很少遇到这样高频地面对生死场面。
As far as she knows, the average age of medical staff at Xinxiang-1 hospital is only 33 years old, and young people take on most of the work in the start-up areas.
刘玲最近感觉到“大家突然都长大了”。
Liu Ling recently felt that "everyone has suddenly grown up."
刘玲此前在普通病房，很少负责重症病房。
Liu Ling was previously in the general ward, rarely in charge of the intensive care unit.
在她护理的病人里，有一位生活不能自理的老人，只能在床上大小便。
Among the patients she cared for, there was an elderly man who could not take care of himself and had to urinate in bed.
因为消化道会有病毒，在处理这些状况时，心里多少会有些纠结，“人家把命都交给你了，也顾不了那么多了”，刘玲带着90后的男护士李建顺一起帮老人整理干净。
Because there will be a virus in the digestive tract, when dealing with these conditions, there will be some confusion, "others have given your life to you, can not take care of so much," Liu Ling and 90-year-old male nurse Li Jianshun help the old man tidy up.
没想到，当天下午，老人去世了。
Unexpectedly, that afternoon, the old man died.
“还好之前给老人换了干净的衣服，不然我们心里真的过不去”，刘玲说。
"Fortunately for the old man before changing clean clothes, or we really can not cross the heart," Liu Ling said.
李建顺此前是重症医学科的护士，对于重症病房里的场面见得多，他深知参与抢救工作的医护人员都会面临视觉、听觉、心理的全方位冲击，很容易出现心理的应激反应。
Li Jianshun, a former intensive care nurse, had seen much of the scene in the intensive care unit. He knew that the medical staff involved in rescue work would face a full range of visual, auditory and psychological shocks, and would easily experience psychological stress.
李建顺适应力强，加上是男生，主动承担起料理遗体的工作。
Li Jianshun flexibility, plus the boys, took the initiative to take care of the body work.
“医护人员不会在病人面前坦露情绪，只在工作之余进行心理调整。
"Health-care workers don't let their emotions hang out in front of patients and just adjust after work.
”李建顺所在单位的一位院长在心理和精神方面是专长，虽然身在后方，会经常在群里帮助一线的同事调整。
One of Li's deans specializes in psychology and spirituality, though he is often in the back of the group helping colleagues on the front line adjust.
心里郁闷时，李建顺也会在住的酒店里听歌和看电影，转移自己的注意力。
When depressed, Li Jianshun will also stay in the hotel to listen to songs and movies, diverting their attention.
治疗后期，医护人员和患者已经建立起良好的沟通病友的一盏夜灯对“死亡”敏感的还有病区里正在治疗的病人。
In the later stages of treatment, health care workers and patients have established a good communication with sick friends of a night light sensitive to "death" as well as patients being treated in the sick area.
刘玲还记得初来病区的感觉，“每个人都不爱说话，病人也很少跟医护人员交流，一日三餐几乎都吃不下，能感受到他们特别压抑。
Liu Ling also remembers how it felt when she first came to the hospital. "Everyone is not talkative, the patients seldom communicate with the doctors and nurses, they can hardly eat three meals a day, and they are particularly depressed.
” 医护人员穿着防护服，也会加重病人的距离感和恐惧情绪。
Health-care workers wearing protective clothing can also exacerbate feelings of alienation and fear.
在新乡一附院领队崔俊伟医生眼里，患者病情大多比较严重，身体一旦出现症状，病人心里会十分紧张，“尤其是呼吸困难的时候，不分年龄，病人很害怕。
In the eyes of Dr. Choi Junwei, the head of a hospital in Xinxiang, most of the patients are very serious. Once the symptoms develop, the patients will be very nervous.
”崔俊伟接触过一名危重病人，住院20天后，病情恢复明显，核酸检测转阴，CT显示肺部好转吸收，症状已被控制，但他会特别关注有病人去世或症状加重的消息，病人出院好转的消息反而被他忽略。
"After 20 days in hospital, Cui Junwei had contact with a critically ill patient. After 20 days in hospital, his condition recovered markedly. Nucleic acid tests turned negative. CT showed that the lungs were better and absorption and symptoms were under control.
为了消除这些病人的恐惧，医护人员会结合精神科医生的意见，发一些治愈系的视频和音频给他们，帮助他们调整心态。
To allay the fears of these patients, medical staff, in consultation with psychiatrists, send them videos and audio of the Department of Healing to help them adjust their mindsets.
对正在治疗的患者打击最大的，还是同房间的病友去世。
The biggest blow to the patients being treated was the death of their roommate.
贾晓阳介绍，去世的病人，在接收时大多病情已很严重，随着病情恶化，有些结果是可以预想到的，但病友去世后，大家还是会情绪低落。
Jia said most of the deceased patients were already seriously ill at the time of admission. Some of the results could be expected as the illness worsened, but they were still depressed after the death of the patient.
在死者被抬出病房后，同房间的病友通常会再次向医护人员求证“病友是不是去世了？”，确认之后就陷入沉默。
After the deceased was taken out of the ward, his roommate would ask the paramedics again "Is the patient dead?" and confirm and fall silent.
贾晓阳只能宽慰他们，“你们精神那么好，又没上呼吸机，肯定能扛过去”。
Jia Xiaoyang can only comfort them, "you spirit so good, and no breathing machine, certainly can carry over."
李建顺也曾陪伴病人度过难熬的夜。
Li Jianshun also accompanied patients through the difficult night.
当晚七八点钟，一位老人病危抢救，医护人员实施抢救时，旁边一位35岁的病人清醒着，为了避免他目睹抢救过程，医护人员将病床前的帘子拉上。
At seven or eight o'clock that night, an elderly man was in critical condition. As paramedics rescued him, a 35-year-old patient woke up. To avoid him witnessing the rescue, paramedics pulled the curtains in front of the bed.
最终老人还是去世了。
At last the old man died.
病床清空后，李建顺特意去察看那名邻床的病人，“他说话声音都是哆嗦的，眼睛盯着我，在寻求帮助。
When the hospital bed was empty, Li went to inspect the patient next to him. "His voice was shaking and he was staring at me for help.
”李建顺安慰他，“每个人的症状和病情都不一样，不要把他人的情况安在自己身上”。
Li consoled him by saying, "Everyone's symptoms are not the same as their illness. Don't put someone else's situation in their own hands."
那天晚上，李建顺把病房的灯留了一夜。
That night, Li Jianshun left the lamp in the ward overnight.
为了让病人安心，他每隔半小时去看他一次，直至凌晨一点，这位病人才睡去。
To reassure the patient, he visited him every half an hour and did not go to sleep until 1 a.m.
直到几天后，这位病人症状减轻，心态才逐渐变好，现在，他已经治愈出院。
It wasn't until a few days later that the patient's symptoms eased and his mind gradually improved. Now he is cured and discharged.
援鄂医护人员合影难以如愿的最后一面向家属传达“死亡消息”是最难的。
It is the hardest part to convey the "news of death" to family members.
在隔离治疗下，家属和医护人员碰面，通常是两种情况。
In isolation treatment, the family and the medical staff meet, usually in two situations.
一种是家属从医护人员手里接回康复的病人，另一种是家属从护士手里领走亲人遗物。
One is the recovery of a patient by a family member from a medical worker, and the other is the removal of a family member's belongings from a nurse.
工作手册规定，患者去世后，医护人员要第一时间通知家属。
The workbook stipulates that after the death of the patient, the medical staff must inform the family immediately.
不可避免的，医护人员必须要充当这个传达“坏消息”的角色。
Inevitably, health-care professionals have to play the role of "bad news."
贾晓阳当班时，曾见过一位家属为亲人送别的场景。
When Jia Xiaoyang was on duty, he had seen a family member send farewell scenes for his relatives.
殡仪馆的车进入病区，一位60多岁的老人在门口等待哥哥的遗体被运出，“老人很平静，还向我们表示感谢”，贾晓阳看到，当殡仪馆人员把遗体推出大门时，老人终于哭了出来，身体靠在墙上，殡仪馆工作人员将他挡在一边。
The undertaker's car entered the sick area, and an elderly man in his sixties was waiting for his brother's body to be taken out. "The old man was calm and thanked us," Jia saw that when the undertaker pushed the body out the door, the old man finally cried and leaned against the wall.
李建顺介绍，为了让家属有心理准备，病人病情加重或者需要抢救时，医护人员都会第一时间通知家属，“这样可以避免家属突然得知患者去世而无法接受。
"In order to prepare the family for a serious illness or need to be rescued, medical staff will immediately notify the family," he said. "This will prevent the family from suddenly learning that the patient is dead and unacceptable.
”但是，还是有一些家属在得知亲人去世后情绪失控。
Still, some family members get out of hand when they learn that a loved one has died.
贾晓阳所在定点医院，一位医生在病人去世后遭到了家属攻击。
Jia Xiaoyang is at the Dingdian Hospital where a doctor was attacked by his family after the death of his patient.
1月29日深夜，武汉市第四医院12楼病区，一名68岁的新冠肺炎患者去世，其女婿情绪激动，抓扯并殴打医生头部和颈部，撕坏医生的防护服和口罩。
Late last night, Jan. 29, a 68-year-old man with pneumonia died in the 12th floor of Wuhan City's Fourth Hospital. His son-in-law was agitated, grabbed and beat the doctor on the head and neck and tore the doctor's protective clothing and mask.
这位医生第二天出现发热症状，后被确诊感染。
The doctor developed fever the next day and was later diagnosed with the infection.
这件事情就发生在河南医疗队所接管的病区楼上，事发第二天，医护人员进出都要把大门落锁，钥匙专门保管，防止家属进入发生冲突，也避免病人外出。
The incident took place in Henan Medical Team took over the upstairs, the second day of the incident, medical personnel have to lock the door, the key to special custody, to prevent families from entering the conflict, and avoid patients to go out.
虽然这件事给李建顺带来的刺激很大，但医疗队援鄂至今，他看到更多的病人和家属理解和支持他们的工作。
Although this incident brought great excitement to Li Jianshun, but the medical team to date, he saw more patients and family members understand and support their work.
病人去世后，贵重遗物都会进行消毒处理，通过专门的窗口递出或者让清洁区的外围人员代为转交家属。
After the death of a patient, precious objects are disinfected, delivered through a special window or handed over to the family by someone from the outside of the cleaning area.
每次通知家属来领遗物，李建顺都会提醒对方，一些不重要的物品尽量不要取回，避免将病毒带回家中，大多家属只领回病人的身份证。
Every time he notifies his family to collect the relics, Li reminds him that some unimportant items should not be retrieved, so as to avoid bringing the virus home.
在交接遗物时，一些家属会问起家人去世的情况，李建顺会如实告诉家人，“病人救治的时候会有痛苦，我们会尽量减少他们的痛苦，使病人有尊严地离世。
When handing over the relics, some family members will ask about the death of their families. Li Jian Shun will tell his family that "there will be pain when patients are cured, and we will minimize their suffering and let them die with dignity.
”每次，家属都会感谢他们陪伴亲人走完人生的最后一程。
"Each time, the family members thanked them for accompanying their loved ones through the final stages of their lives.
李建顺遇到过一位40多岁的男子，他执着地想见母亲最后一面，在病区外站了很久，迟迟不肯离开。
Li Jianshun met a man in his 40s. He insisted on seeing his mother for the last time and stood outside the sick area for a long time, refusing to leave.
他告知家属这样可能面临的风险，对方考虑了20分钟最后还是听从劝阻离开了。
He informed his family of the possible risks, and after 20 minutes of consideration, he finally agreed to be dissuaded from leaving.
“没让他们见上最后一面，我们也很遗憾的，但毕竟是传染病，为了家人着想，只能劝解。
"We're sorry they didn't see each other on the last side, but it was an infectious disease and had to be persuaded for the sake of their families.
”在武汉疫情最紧张的那段时期，平日里不善言辞的贾晓阳，很少主动问起病人家庭的情况，怕听到对方家人感染去世的消息。
During the most intense period of the Wuhan epidemic, Jia Xiaoyang, who was usually uncommunicative, rarely asked questions about his family, fearing news that his family had died of the infection.
随着疫情的缓解，贾晓阳紧绷的神经才放松下来，在送一位老人出院时，第一次尝试着和老人聊天，却意外得知老人唯一的孩子因新冠肺炎去世的消息。
As the epidemic subsided, Jia's strained nerves relaxed, sending an old man out of hospital to talk for the first time only to learn that the old man's only child had died of pneumonia.
她至今都很懊悔，“我那一天很嘴贱。
She still regretted it. "I was mean that day.
”李建顺护理过一对老年夫妇，爷爷在照顾奶奶时被传染，在老人互相不能见面的情况下，李建顺成了老人间的传话筒，帮忙转达两人间的关心和鼓励，化解奶奶心中的歉意。
"Li Jianshun took care of an elderly couple. Grandfather was infected while taking care of his grandmother. When the old people couldn't meet each other, Li Jian-shun became the old man's microphone.
后来，两位老人双双好转出院。
Later, both of them got better and left the hospital.
如今，河南援鄂医疗队已工作50多天，贾晓阳很想家。
Today, Henan medical team has been working for more than 50 days, Jia Xiaoyang is homesick.
李建顺则希望，“离开时在武汉站前合张影，来年再到武汉赏樱花”。
Li Jianshun hopes that, "leave in Wuhan Station before Zhang Ying, the next year to Wuhan cherry blossom appreciation."
他们坚守的病区已经近一个月没有出现死亡病例，回家的日子不远了。
They have been holding on to the area for nearly a month without any deaths and are not far from home.
