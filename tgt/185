在一个叫“侠义帮”的海外捐助信息共享群中，廖女士说：“其实挺震撼的，以前一定会能听到各种风声和噪音。
"It was quite shocking," Liao said in a group of information-sharing groups called chivalry. "There must have been a lot of wind and noise.
只有这次，真的是全球的华人和友人都在一起出钱出力，基本看不见负面消息。
Only this time, it was really the Chinese and friends around the world who were spending money together, barely seeing the bad news.
”文 |余晓璐 吴敏霞  编辑 | 沈小山连日来新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情牵动人心，各地海外华人希望为湖北疫情出力，然而他们不约而同遇到种种困难：求助信息鱼龙混杂、医疗物资标准不明，海关清关流程待确认，医院接受手续复杂，除此之外还面临跨国物流时间长以及换汇问题。
At the same time, overseas Chinese seeking to contribute to the outbreak of the coronavirus pneumonia have encountered difficulties ranging from mixed help messages to unclear standards of medical supplies, pending customs clearance procedures and complicated hospital reception procedures, as well as lengthy cross-border logistics and foreign exchange problems.
疫情初期武汉市新型冠状病毒肺炎防控指挥部、慈善总会和红十字会、湖北各大医院等官方机构发出的公告写明暂不接受海外物资，而事实上医院实际上物资却面临紧缺。
The new-style coronavirus pneumonia command, the General Association of Philanthropy and the Red Cross and major hospitals in Hubei state in the early stage of the outbreak that they will not accept overseas supplies.
一边希望捐助，一边亟待捐助，沟通渠道成为关键。
Communication channels are key while wishing to donate while waiting to be donated.
不少海外捐助组织前期摸石头过河，克服困难打通物资渠道。
Many overseas donor organizations touch stones to cross the river in advance to overcome difficulties in opening up material channels.
我们采访了经验丰厚的组织，希望他们的经验能帮助更多海外爱心人士顺利捐赠。
We have interviewed experienced organisations and hope that their experience will help more people from overseas to donate freely.
境外捐赠初遇重重困难1月23日，武汉市宣布封城，25日黄冈市紧随其后。
First encounter difficulties in foreign donations January 23, Wuhan City announced the closure of the city, 25 Huanggang followed.
为帮黄冈家乡争取更多资源，黄冈中学校友会成员李军（化名）加入了校友会境外捐赠沟通群。
To help Huang Gang home for more resources, Huang Gang School Alumni Association member Li Jun (alias) joined the Alumni Association overseas donation communication group.
李军和校友们整理的黄冈主要医院的物资需求和联系方式，通过中国日报等媒体和大V转发，集中向社会公开。
The material needs and contact details of the main hospital in Huanggang, collated by Li Jun and his alumni, were relayed through the China Daily and other media and relayed to the general public.
海外寻找货的物资需求和联系方式，通过中国日报等媒体和大V转发，集中向社会公开。

微博上海外华人吐露捐助困难1月25日，武汉海关发布接受海外捐赠医疗物资的免税通关流程，称紧急情况下可先放行后补办手续。
Wuhan Customs announces tax-free customs procedures for accepting donations of medical materials from overseas, saying it can release them first in case of emergency.
1月27日，武汉海关设置绿色通道，口罩、防护服等疫情防控急需物资得到快速验放。
On January 27, Wuhan Customs set up a green passage, respirator, protective clothing and other urgent needs for the prevention and control of materials to be quickly tested.
1月29日，湖北红十字会发布了《湖北省红十字会应对新型冠状病毒感染肺炎疫情海外物资捐赠流程（第3号）》，公布了海外捐赠的详细流程。
On January 29, the Hubei Red Cross Society issued the Procedures of Donation of Overseas Materials to the Red Cross Society of Hubei Province in Response to the Infection of New Coronavirus Infected with Coronavirus (No.3).
黄冈中学校友会很快发现，境外物资在武汉和长沙清关最快，但如果经过武汉海关，很大程度上会被调走统一分发，不能到达指定医院。
The Huang Gang Middle School Alumni Association soon found that goods from abroad were cleared the quickest in Wuhan and Changsha, but that if they passed Wuhan Customs, they would be transferred and distributed in a uniform way and could not reach the designated hospitals.
为了让黄冈一线医护人员能早日接收物资，李军只能选择物资到达武汉后，由黄冈新冠肺炎指挥部领回黄冈市疾控中心，再由各医院申领。
In order to let Huanggang first-line medical personnel can receive supplies, LI Jun can only choose materials to Wuhan, Huanggang Xinguan Pneumonia Command to take back the city CDC, and then the hospitals apply.
李军说：“这种调拨物品、组织捐赠的事情本由红十字会来协调的，24-26日红十字会电话没人接，我们志愿者才发挥了重要作用。
"It was the Red Cross that coordinated the transfer of goods and donations," Li said. "The Red Cross did not answer the phone on the 24th to 26th and our volunteers played an important role.
如果物资直接捐到指定医院的话，红十字会应该没有理由阻止吧。
If supplies are donated directly to designated hospitals, the Red Cross should have no reason to stop it.
”这是疫情防控工作紧张进行时的无奈之举。
This is the case when prevention and control efforts are intense.
美国首都华盛顿地区志愿者捐助平台发起人彬哥说：“国内对于海外捐赠最初不知道是出于什么心理拒绝，海外赤子的一片爱心不应该遭到打击，国家在制定相关法规的时候，应该充分考虑到这一点。
"Domestic rejection of overseas donations was initially unknown, and the love of overseas children should not be attacked," said Bingo, founder of the Washington-area volunteer platform. "The state should take this fully into account when formulating regulations.
还有，对于接受捐赠的限制太严苛，有接收资质的只有红十字会和慈善总会，而这两家慈善机构都有国字号背景，公信力非常低，在网上传出谣言的时候，处理也不及时，造成更大的信任危机。
Moreover, the restrictions on accepting donations are too restrictive, with only the Red Cross and the General Association of Charities, both of which have a national name background, have very low credibility and are not handled in a timely manner when rumours are circulated online, creating a greater crisis of confidence.
”志愿者颂颂说：“海关绿色通道是当地时间1月24日发布的，从那天开始我们觉得进展有希望了。
"Since the launch of the Customs Green Channel on January 24, local time, we feel hopeful," the volunteers said.
我们很不希望我们的努力被排斥，如果没有后来海关绿色通道的开启和接受海外捐赠这两个消息，我们的信心和信念也会倍受打击。
We do not want our efforts to be marginalized, and our confidence and faith would have suffered had it not been for the news of the opening of the Customs Green Channel and the acceptance of overseas donations.
”1月30日李军在物资群中表示，“武汉海关红十字会截留所有境外物资，国内快递也一律到红会”。
"Wuhan Customs Red Cross Society will retain all overseas goods, and domestic express will be sent to the Red Cross Society," Li said on January 30.
问题不断发生，他们也在不断寻找解决的途径。
Problems continue to arise and they are constantly searching for solutions.
幸运的是，当天武汉红十字会发布了《武汉市红十字会对社会公告（第六号）》，表示“境内外单位或个人如有定向捐赠意愿，可与定向捐赠医疗机构直接联系，确认后可以将捐献物资直接发往受捐单位。
Fortunately, the Wuhan Red Cross Society issued the Wuhan Red Cross Society Notice (No. 6) on the same day, saying that "units or individuals inside or outside China who wish to donate directly to targeted donation medical institutions can confirm that the donated materials can be sent directly to the recipient units.
”这给海外捐赠提供了极大便利。
This has greatly facilitated overseas donations.
李军终于不用担心在武汉被扣留的可能性了。
Li Jun finally did not have to worry about the possibility of being detained in Wuhan.
困境的解决和大多数海外捐助组织相同，美国首都华盛顿地区志愿者捐助平台初建时，也遇到了困惑。
The solution to the plight is the same as that of most overseas donor organizations, and the first volunteer platform in the Washington area of the United States met with confusion.
带头人彬哥马上成立了几个工作组明确分工：首先是负责落实信息的信息联络组；第二是负责打通运输渠道的运输组；第三是专门负责对接国内医院需求与美国物资渠道的资源对接组，第四是负责检查分类医疗物资的义工分拣组。
Mr. Bingley, the leader of the group, immediately set up several working groups: first, the Information Liaison Group, which is responsible for implementing the information; secondly, the Transport Section, which is responsible for opening up the transportation channels; thirdly, the Resource Docking Unit, which is responsible for docking domestic hospital needs with United States material channels; and the Fourth, the Volunteer Sorting Group, which examines classified medical supplies.
总结组织经验，彬哥说：“快速反应很重要，最开始成立这个捐助平台，我想到国内疫情一线的医护人员需求的是物资，所以我们第一时间不是把精力放在捐款上，我觉得国内的医院不缺钱，但是能够从哪儿弄到物资是最当务之急。
"Rapid response is very important," he said. "When I first started setting up the donation platform, I thought the medical staff in the front line of the epidemic wanted supplies, so we didn't first focus on donations.
我们在发动大家集结物资的同时，也在落实信息，打通各个通道。
While we are mobilizing our materials, we are also carrying out information and opening up channels.
”开始摸索一个快速安全的渠道是难的。
It is difficult to start groping for a fast and safe channel.
最初为了快速送达物资，美国首都华盛顿地区志愿者捐助平台决定让捐赠物资按照普通货运输送，并联系航空公司申请优惠，后来美国有一家华人快递公司开通了免费专线，两三天就能把捐助物资飞到武汉。
Originally, in an effort to deliver supplies quickly, the Washington area volunteer platform decided to send donations by regular freight and contact airlines for preferential treatment. Later, a Chinese express company in the United States opened a toll-free line that allowed donations to be flown to Wuhan in two or three days.
平台在武汉还请了两位物资的接收人，最大程度保障物资在武汉的运输的透明度。
The platform also invited two recipients of materials in Wuhan to maximize the transparency of the transport of materials in Wuhan.
彬哥说：“这是对我们所有志愿者和募捐人爱心的负责。
"This is a loving duty for all of us volunteers and fund-raisers," he said.
”稳健的办事原则使华盛顿捐助平台得到了顺利的进展：23号武汉封城，24号上午得到消息医院物资短缺，下午开始集结人力物力，25号集结完毕，28号筹备第一批物资，经多方协调确保能顺利入关后，31号第一批物资发出。
The first batch of materials was dispatched after the first batch of materials was assembled in the afternoon, and the first batch of materials was issued after the first batch of materials could be secured through multi-party coordination.
他们的一些经验，或许可以给其他捐赠组织来带启发。
Some of their experiences may be instructive for other donor organizations.
华人的力量海外华人华侨组织从得知疫情迅速行动，至今仍在积极募集物资捐赠回国内。
The overseas Chinese Chinese Organization, the Chinese power, has acted quickly to learn of the outbreak and is still actively collecting materials for donation to China.
在抵抗疫情中，海外华人不遗余力地汇集成一股巨大的力量。

The first batch of materials on the Washington DC Volunteer Donation Platform did not go on holiday overseas, and many volunteers left their jobs to participate in donor activities.

The volunteers gained not only good news about the increasing flow of material aid channels, but also the warmth of Chinese solidarity in the face of the epidemic.

在华盛顿的一个仓库中，志愿者在繁忙的分拣物资，有的华人买不到医疗用品捐赠，为了表达自己的爱心，包了水饺给收货分检的义工们送来了午饭。
At a warehouse in Washington, volunteers packed up their lunch in dumplings for the volunteers at the receiving end of a busy sorting process. Some Chinese couldn't buy donations of medical supplies and, as a sign of their love, packed the dumplings and delivered lunch to the volunteers.
美国的志愿者到Home Depot买口罩，店员知道是要捐回给中国，马上打了折还把最贵的一盒免单，说这算是他们尽的一点心意。
When an American volunteer came to Home Depot to buy a mask, the clerk knew it would be donated back to China. The clerk immediately discounted the most expensive box and said it was a small token of their gratitude.
很多参与物资捐助的志愿者在国内家里人也一直没来得及用上N95。
Many of the volunteers involved in material donations have not been able to use N95 in their homes in the country.
“你会发现很多志愿者都在想自己能做的事情，特别开心”黄冈中学校友会的李军分享到。
"You will find that many volunteers are thinking about what they can do," said Li Jun of the Huang Gang Middle School Alumni Association.
在一个叫“侠义帮”的海外捐助信息共享群中，廖女士说：“其实挺震撼的，以前一定会能听到各种风声和噪音。

”彬哥说：“此次事件，充分体现了我们华人群体的凝聚力。

最让我感动的是大家在群里众志成城，集思广益，聚精会神的抢物资，表现出了空前的团结。
Most of all, I was moved by the fact that we were able to come together in a group, brainstorm, concentrate on material recovery and show unprecedented solidarity.
