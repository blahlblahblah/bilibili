”2月13日，湖北省突然激增的新冠肺炎病例引起了极大的关注。
Hubei province on February 13 witnessed a sharp rise in the number of cases of new crown pneumonia.
湖北省卫生健康委官方发布消息显示，2月12日0时-24时，湖北省新增新冠肺炎病例14840例（含临床诊断病例13332例），截至2020年2月12日24时，湖北省累计报告新冠肺炎病例48206例（含临床诊断病例13332例），全省累计治愈出院3441例，全省累计病亡1310例，目前仍在院治疗33693例。
From 0000 to 2400 hours on February 12, a total of 14,840 new cases of pneumonia (including 13,332 cases of clinical diagnosis) were reported in Hubei Province. As of 2400 hours on February 12, 2020, a total of 4,8206 new cases of pneumonia (including 13,332 cases of clinical diagnosis) had been reported in Hubei Province.
湖北确诊病例数量的激增，来自分类方法的变化。
The rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases in Hubei Province resulted from changes in classification methods.
同2月11日病例报告不同的是，2月12日的湖北病例报告将临床诊断病例统计计入确诊病例中并提示。
In contrast to the case report of 11 February, the Hubei case report of 12 February counted the number of clinically diagnosed cases among the confirmed cases with hints.
根据2月5日，国家卫健委办公厅正式公布的《关于印发新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎诊疗方案（试行第五版）》（下简称：第五版诊疗方案），第五版诊疗方案较前一版诊疗方案，将诊断标准分为湖北省外省份诊断标准，及湖北省诊断标准——其中湖北省诊断标准部分增加了临床诊断病例这一分类。
On February 5, the Office of the State Council for Health officially announced the "Diagnosis and Treatment Programme for New Coronavirus Infections (Trial Version 5)," the fifth edition of the Diagnostic Programme classifies the diagnostic criteria into two categories: Hubei Province, Hubei Province, and Hubei Province, Hubei Province.
我们简单总结下，便是湖北省疑似病例具有肺炎影像学特征者，便归类为临床诊断病例，而在2月12日的湖北省病例报告中，又把临床诊断病例计入了确诊病例中。
In a brief summary, suspected cases in Hubei province were classified as clinically diagnosed cases, while in the February 12 case report for Hubei province, clinical diagnoses were added to the list of confirmed cases.
而在湖北省以外的省份，临床表现需结合流行病学史，符合以下2条或3条者，为疑似病例。
In provinces outside Hubei province, clinical manifestation should be combined with epidemiology history. Those who meet 2 or 3 below are suspected cases.
具有肺炎学影像学特征发热和/或呼吸道症状发病早期白细胞总数正常或降低，或淋巴细胞计数减少也就是说，湖北省外的患者，在具有肺炎影像学特征时，仍需要满足其他临床表现，方为新冠肺炎疑似病例。
Pneumonia imaging features fever and / or respiratory symptoms in the early stage of leukocyte count normal or reduced, or lymphocyte count reduction that is, patients outside Hubei province who have imaging characteristics of pneumonia still need to meet other clinical manifestations in order to be suspected cases of New Crown Pneumonia.
中央指导组专家、北京朝阳医院副院长童朝晖在接受央视新闻采访时表示，此前医生日常工作中也存在临床诊断。
Central guidance group experts, Beijing Chaoyang Hospital Vice-President Tong Chaohui said in CCTV news interview, doctors before the routine work there is also a clinical diagnosis.
“平时诊断肺炎时，实际上病原学百分之二、三十要靠临床百分之七、八十来诊断。
"When diagnosing pneumonia, two or thirty percent of the etiology is actually diagnosed by seven or eighty percent clinically.
（注：确诊病例的核酸检测及基因测序为病原学诊断。
(Note: Nucleic acid testing and gene sequencing in confirmed cases are etiological diagnoses.
）所以这次在湖北地区增加了临床诊断病例。
So this time the number of clinical cases in Hubei increased.
前段时间我们主要靠核酸来进行确诊病例，但实际上有一大部分疑似病例按照临床表现都有：1、有流行病学史；2、发热、呼吸道咳嗽、憋气的症状。
Recently, we mainly rely on nucleic acid to confirm the case, but in fact, a large number of suspected cases according to the clinical manifestation: 1, an epidemiological history; 2, fever, respiratory tract cough, suffocating symptoms.
然后进行查体检查临床特征，做CT影像后进行一个综合诊断。
Then the clinical features of the physical examination, CT imaging after a comprehensive diagnosis.
”童朝晖说。
"said Tong.
此前由于核酸检测存在假阴性率问题，多次有患者影像学特征符合新冠肺炎影像学，但是核酸检测为阴性，无法被计入到确诊病例中。
Because of the false-negative rate of nucleic acid testing, the imaging features of several patients were consistent with the new crown pneumonia imaging, but the nucleic acid test was negative and could not be counted in the confirmed cases.
此前，武汉大学中南医院医学影像科副主任张笑春教授在朋友圈发布“强烈推荐CT影像作为目前新冠肺炎首选诊断方法”，张笑春在接受人民日报采访时表示，“CT阳性、核酸阴性’的结果，可能影响临床排查。
Zhang Xiaochun, deputy director of medical imaging at Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital, told People's Daily that the results of CT-positive, nucleic acid-negative results could affect clinical screening.
”由于做核酸检测需要专业人员及专业实验室，操作要求高，并不能在多数医院普及。
Because nucleic acid testing requires professionals and specialized laboratories, it is highly demanding and not universally available in most hospitals.
而CT检查方便、快捷，易于在多数医院普及。
CT examination is convenient, fast and easy to popularize in most hospitals.
但由于其他病毒或细菌感染也可能出现同新冠病毒感染出现类似的“大白肺”情况，此前有专家认为CT检测不宜推广到全国，湖北省外地区或不适用将CT影像作为确诊病例的临床表现。
However, since other viruses or bacterial infections may also appear with the new canopy virus infection similar to the "large white lung" situation, some experts believe that CT testing should not be extended to the whole country, Hubei Province or not applicable to CT imaging as a confirmed case of clinical manifestations.
张笑春在采访中也曾表示，在新冠冠病毒肺炎形势严峻的今天，武汉等地区的防控必须采取‘不放过一个’的非常规手段，减少交叉感染。
Zhang Xiaochun also said in the interview, in the new crown virus pneumonia situation is serious today, Wuhan and other areas of the prevention and control must take 'not miss' the unconventional means to reduce cross-infection.
”而将湖北符合影像学标准的患者管理好，将有利于疫情的防控。
And good management of patients in Hubei who meet imaging standards will help prevent and control the disease.
