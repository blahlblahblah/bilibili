《创新经济战疫计划》，是燃财经在新型肺炎疫情期间推出的特别栏目，关注创新经济企业遇到的新难题、商讨应该采取的新对策，希望能够帮助中小企业一起战胜挑战、把握机会。
The Innovation Economic Plague Program is a special section of the New Pneumonia Epidemic launched by FCI. It focuses on the new difficulties encountered by innovative economic enterprises, discusses new measures to be adopted, and hopes to help SMEs overcome challenges and seize opportunities together.
作者 | 唐亚华编辑 | 魏佳2月10日起，北京、上海、深圳等城市陆续复工，写字楼里逐渐恢复了人气，但以往沉迷于奶茶、咖啡的白领们，不得不习惯一段没有下午茶的日子。
At the start of February 10, when Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen began to resume work, office buildings have gradually regained their popularity, but white-collar workers who used to indulge in tea and coffee have had to get used to a day without afternoon tea.
受疫情影响，星巴克临时关闭中国大陆的2000多家门店，瑞幸咖啡、奈雪的茶、喜茶等品牌已经关闭武汉地区全部店铺，其他省份的门店也受到一定影响。
As a result of the epidemic, Starbucks has temporarily closed more than 2,000 stores in mainland China, while brands such as Ruixin, Nessie tea and tea have closed all shops in Wuhan, while others have been affected.
尽管外卖能带来一定营收，但由于房租、人力的硬性成本，受制于配送资源短缺、产品非刚需等因素，有投资人预测，茶饮企业能维持以前一半的收入就算不错。
Although take-out can bring a certain amount of revenue, but because of the hard costs of rent, manpower, limited distribution resources, non-demand factors, investors predict that tea enterprises can maintain half of the previous income is good.
在这个特殊时期，业内人士建议企业首先应盯紧现金流，做好融资，控制成本。
In this special period, industry insiders suggest that enterprises should first focus on cash flow, do a good job of financing, cost control.
同时，要抓住这一波线上流量，一方面通过线上开放茶饮配方、配合营销活动积攒流量，另一方面可以抓住时机做好品牌传播。
At the same time, to seize this line of traffic, on the one hand, open tea drink formulation online, cooperate with marketing activities to save traffic, on the other hand, can seize the opportunity to do a good job in brand communication.
此外，开发速溶等新产品也是一种思路。
In addition, the development of fast-dissolving and other new products is a way of thinking.
有创业者预测，乐观来看，未来两至三个月左右，线下门店能够恢复疫情前80%以上的营收水平。
One entrepreneur predicts that, optimistically, over the next two to three months, offline stores will be able to recover more than 80 per cent of their pre-epidemic revenues.
所以，大家想随时随地喝到奶茶咖啡，可能还需要等到四五月份。
Therefore, we want to drink tea and milk coffee anytime, may have to wait until April and May.
长远来看，疫情期间会使得马太效应更强，抓住机会完成质变的企业会是未来赢家。
In the long run, the Matthew effect will be stronger during the epidemic, and companies that seize the opportunity to achieve qualitative change will be the winners of the future.
多店关停，部分品牌业务减半本周开始，多家公司陆续复工，但想要喝到下午茶并不容易。
Dozens of stores have closed, some brands have halved since the start of the week, and companies are resuming work, but afternoon tea isn't easy.
疫情之下，茶饮、咖啡行业作为重资产属性的线下业态，同样面临重创。
Under the epidemic situation, tea drinking, coffee industry as a heavy asset attribute of the offline industry, also face a serious blow.
喜茶、奈雪的茶、乐乐茶等新茶饮品牌在疫情发生后，关闭了武汉地区的店铺，其他地区的店铺也受到不同程度影响。
After the outbreak of the epidemic, new tea brands such as wedding tea, snow tea and Le Le tea closed shops in Wuhan, and shops in other areas were also affected to varying degrees.
奈雪的茶公关总监王依告诉燃财经，目前，奈雪全国门店有349家，1月23日前武汉地区门店已全部暂停营业，其它疫情较严重地区的部分门店也于春节期间暂停营业。
So far, 349 shops have been closed in Wuhan before Jan. 23, and some stores in other severely affected areas have been closed during the Lunar New Year, Wang Yi, Nessie's tea public relations director, told Flaming Finance.
近几日，部分门店陆续恢复营业。
Some stores have been reopening in recent days.
“跟其它的餐饮品牌一样，大部分门店暂停营业对我们经营会有影响，主要是围绕租金、人工这两块硬性投入，部分食材损耗也带来了压力，额外的支出还包括为员工提供口罩、消毒液等物资。
"Like other food brands, the suspension of most stores will have an impact on our operations, mainly around the two hard-core inputs of rent and manpower, some of which are due to material losses. Additional expenses include supplying staff with masks, disinfectants, etc.
”王依介绍。
"said Wang.
咖啡行业面临的情况也类似。
The situation is similar in the coffee sector.
此前，星巴克宣布暂时关闭中国大陆一半以上的门店。
The move followed the announcement by Starbucks to temporarily close more than half of mainland China's stores.
据悉，截至2019年年底，星巴克在中国的门店为4292家。
Starbucks had 4,292 stores in China by the end of 2019.
照此推算，星巴克临时关闭了2000多家门店。
By that reckoning, Starbucks has temporarily closed more than 2,000 stores.
除了临时关店，星巴克还调整了部分门店营业时间。
In addition to temporary closures, Starbucks has also adjusted some of its store opening hours.
在星巴克1月28日公布的2020财年第一季度财报中也提及，新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情可能对其2020财年第二季度，乃至2020财年全年的业绩产生较大影响，而中国一直是星巴克海外最大市场之一。
The new coronavirus pneumonia could have a bigger impact on the company's overall performance in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, or even fiscal year 2020, which has been one of Starbucks' biggest overseas markets, according to Starbucks' January 28 first-quarter 2020 results.
瑞幸咖啡方面则表示，已于1月23日暂停了武汉地区的全部门店，2月3日起，全国门店陆续恢复营业。
Ruixin coffee, said that the January 23 suspension of all shops in Wuhan region, February 3, the national stores have resumed business.
图 / 视觉中国一些中小型咖啡连锁品牌，受到的冲击同样严重。
Some small and medium-sized Chinese coffee chains have been hit just as hard.
鱼眼咖啡创始人孙瑜向燃财经介绍，鱼眼咖啡主营的是店铺面积在20-40平米的咖啡厅，线上线下结合，主打外卖和自提，主要面向办公室白领客群。
Sun Yu, founder of Fish-Eye Coffee, told the Financial Times that the main fish-eye coffee shop is 20-40 square meters of coffee shop area, online and offline combination, mainly for the office white-collar customers.
疫情的影响主要集中在最近两周，本该复工的时候大多数企业暂时还没有复工。
The epidemic's impact has been concentrated in the past two weeks, when most companies were due to resume work.
受疫情的影响，目前20多家店有一半左右在营业。
Affected by the epidemic, more than half of the 20 stores are now open.
他表示，从过去两周的数据来看，整体的影响还是非常大的，一些门店根据当地政府、业主和物业的要求暂时停止营业。
He said the overall impact was significant over the past two weeks, with some stores temporarily closed to local authorities, property owners and property owners.
另外一些营业的门店也会相应调整缩减营业的时间，本周营业中的门店单店出杯量约为正常水平的50%。
Other stores will adjust their operating hours accordingly, with stores in business this week offering about 50% of their normal output per store.
目前，最主要的挑战是受疫情影响线下门店流量的大幅度减少所带来的短时间内营收的减少，全年店面扩张计划或营销方面会做相应的调整，下一步会更谨慎。
At present, the most important challenge is to reduce short-term revenue due to the significant reduction of the off-line store traffic affected by the epidemic.
另外，实体行业总部支持人员在家办公沟通不如在办公室方便。
In addition, physical industry headquarters support staff home office communication is not as convenient as in the office.
不过，整体来看情况比孙瑜想象中要好一些，鱼眼咖啡的店面模型不大，以往外卖和自提要占单量的80%以上。
On the whole, though, the situation is better than Sun Yu imagined. Fish-eye coffee has a small storefront model, accounting for more than 80% of take-out and self-feed orders.
在他看来，星巴克这样的传统大型连锁企业受到的现金流冲击相对更大，因为它们的门店的数量极大，且大部分是大店，以堂食为主，虽然去年说引入了外卖，但并不是主打部分，每个品牌的客户都有相对固定的消费习惯，大部分日常到店购买的客户，外卖不太可能短时间形成大规模的趋势，即使快速转型，运营上也会存在挑战。
In his view, large traditional chains such as Starbucks have been hit relatively hard by cash flows, because they have a large number of stores, mostly large and dominated by Don's, and while takeout is said to be introduced last year, it is not a major part of it.
免配送费、线上促销、扩张品类自救部分门店关闭，对于仍在营业的门店，这些品牌均鼓励顾客线上下单、力推外卖以拉动销量。
Free distribution fees, online promotions, expansion of the category of self-help some stores closed, but still open stores, these brands encourage customers to line up and down, push take-out to boost sales.
王依介绍，奈雪的茶的外卖产品新增外卖安心卡，登记各环节制作人、配餐员、配送员姓名及实时体温。
Wang Yi introduced, Nessie's tea take-out products new peace of mind cards, registration links producers, waiters, distributors and real-time body temperature.
为了引导顾客多使用线上下单，避免店内出现排队、拥挤现象，到2月29日前通过奈雪小程序下单均免除配送费，支持无接触配送服务。
In order to guide customers to use the line up and down, to avoid queuing and congestion in the store, by February 29 through the small order order to support contact distribution services.
喜茶、乐乐茶也在无接触配送、免配送费等方面推出了相应措施。
Happy tea, Le Le tea also in contact distribution, free distribution fees and other aspects of the corresponding measures.
不过，由于运力缺乏，想要点到外卖并不容易。
However, it is not easy to order take-out due to lack of capacity.
燃财经在北京崇文门体验发现，仅奈雪的茶可以下单外卖，喜茶显示附近的门店都已休息，乐乐茶显示不在配送范围。
Caixue experience in Chongwen Men, Beijing, found that only Nai Xue tea can be ordered to take away, wedding tea shows the nearby stores have been closed, Le Le tea shows no distribution range.
随后，燃财经尝试在永安里附近下单，发现这三家均无法配送，而此前，同一地址这三家均可配送。
Subsequently, Flaming Finance attempted to place orders near Yongan Li and found that none of the three could be delivered at the same address before.
图 / 视觉中国受疫情影响，孙瑜也认识到线上渠道显然比之前更加重要。
Photo / Vision China was affected by the epidemic and Sun Yu realized that the online channel was clearly more important than before.
“这个时候，我们的主要措施是继续刺激外卖，外卖渠道上我们都加大了折扣力度。
"At this point, our main move is to continue to stimulate take-out, where we are all increasing our discounts.
另外我们是一个综合的咖啡品牌，整个咖啡的供应链都是我们自己在做，除了现磨咖啡，我们还有快消类产品，例如咖啡豆、挂耳咖啡，用户也可以自己在家做咖啡。
In addition, we are an integrated coffee brand, the entire coffee supply chain is done by ourselves, in addition to raw coffee, we also have fast-extinguishing products, such as coffee beans, ear-hanging coffee, and users can make their own coffee at home.
除了需要快递的电商渠道外，在门店配送范围的，这些也都可以直接通过小程序自营外卖渠道和第三方外卖平台来配送。
In addition to the need for express delivery business channels, in store distribution range, these can also be directly through the small procedures of proprietary delivery channels and third-party delivery platforms to distribute.
”他解释。
'he explained.
2月11日，鱼眼咖啡上线了天猫旗舰店，第一天就有几百单订单，最近线下门店所有的挂耳咖啡，基本也是早上发布外卖，到中午全部售罄。
Feb. 11, fish-eye coffee on line on the flagship store, the first day there are hundreds of orders, recently off-line shop all hung-ear coffee, basically issued in the morning, all sold out by noon.
与此同时，他们也在利用这个机会来打磨快消品类适应线上业务。
At the same time, they are taking advantage of the opportunity to sharpen fast-extinguishing products to fit into online business.
“在新店的拓展上，如果特别好的店铺位置我们还是会去考虑，因为疫情的原因，整体市场谨慎，在租金的优化和更多点位的选择上可能会有更多的机会出来，对我们同样反而也会是一个机会。
"We will consider new stores if they are particularly good because of the epidemic, because the overall market is cautious and there are more opportunities for rent optimization and more site selection, but it will also be an opportunity for us.
” 他表示，今年公司在整个策略上会更谨慎，注重精细化运营，压缩不必要的成本，压缩SKU以做得更精，修炼内功，等流量恢复过来的时候，以更好的状态提供产品和服务。
This year, he says, the company will be more cautious in its overall strategy, focusing on fine-tuning operations, cutting unnecessary costs, compressing SKUs to do better, refining internal work and providing products and services in better shape when traffic recovers.
孙瑜预计，好的情况下，随着逐渐恢复的复工，未来两到三个月的时间，线下门店能够恢复疫情前80%以上的营收水平。
In a good situation, with gradual resumption of work, Sun predicted that over the next two to three months, off-line stores would be able to restore more than 80% of the pre-epidemic revenue level.
茶饮行业苏醒期比餐饮业更快此前，西贝餐饮董事长贾国龙称账上现金流扛不过3个月，外婆家餐饮创始人吴国平说“天一亮就要支付250万元”，同样担负着高昂房租和人力成本的茶饮行业，也会面临如此大的危机吗？首先不可否认的是，茶饮行业会受到比较大的影响。
Before that, Jia Guolong, chairman of Xibei restaurant, said the cash flow was just three months away, while Wu Guoping, founder of the family restaurant, said: "Two and a half million yuan will be paid at daybreak," and the tea-drinking industry, also burdened by high rents and labor costs, faces such a big crisis.
众海投资副总裁张烨秋认为，哪怕有外卖业务，茶饮行业能维持以前一半的收入就不错。
Vice-president Zhang Yeqiu thinks that even if there is take-out, the tea industry can maintain half of its previous earnings.
好在茶饮行业的资金周转效率快，属于鲜食，上游是保质期较短的水果、牛奶等产品，基本上是按天进行周转的，不至于囤货太多。
Fortunately, the tea industry capital turnover efficiency is fast, belonging to fresh food, upstream is a shorter shelf life of fruit, milk and other products, basically daily turnover, not too much stock.
在他看来，瑞幸咖啡提供了一个很好的模式，如果新茶饮品牌也做瑞幸的街边店、线上模式，利润情况会更好。
In his view, Ruixin coffee provides a good model, if the new tea brand also do Ruixin street store, online model, profit situation will be better.
但目前行业内几家企业都还没有把线上放在特别重要的位置，更重视线下竞争，因为如果线下的位置没有很好的锁住，可能就成为了竞争对手的地盘。
But several companies in the industry have yet to place particular emphasis on online versus offline competition, because if the offline location is not well locked, it could become a competitor's territory.
大家一直没有那么强的动力去做商业模式的创新，或把线下的流量放到线上去。
There has never been such a strong incentive to innovate in business models or to put offline traffic on line.
“这波疫情给了大家一个危机感，会把线上业务的优先级排得更高，而且这样的危机一定程度上又培养起了用户对于鲜食的互联网模式的接受度。
"The epidemic has given people a sense of crisis that puts online business higher on the list, and it has, to some extent, fostered user acceptance of the fresh Internet model."
”张烨秋表示。
"Zhang Yeqiu said.
长期关注咖啡行业的北京斯葵迩文化科技有限公司创始人张宏向燃财经表示，疫情对茶饮行业的影响肯定有，但远不及对西贝这种纯餐饮业，尤其是以堂食为主企业的影响。
Zhang Hongxiang, founder of Beijing-based Sunny Cultural Technology Co., a long-time coffee maker, said the epidemic's impact on the tea-drinking industry was certain, but far less than that on the local restaurant industry, especially the Don-based enterprises.
他分析，饮品行业属于更加快消的行业，餐饮从点菜到菜端上来通常需要一段时间，而制作一杯饮品，只要前期准备好，45秒到1分钟就可以，它的制作效率更高，如果线上爆发，只要保证原材料准备充足，饮品的制作速度加快就可以，添加更多的人力也比较容易，满足某个区域或突然的网络平台爆发式的增长就可以。
He analyses that the beverage industry is one of the more rapidly disappearing industries, where it usually takes time to order food and produce a drink that takes 45 seconds to 1 minute to prepare. If an online explosion occurs, it can be made faster if the raw materials are well prepared, drinks are produced faster, and it is easier to add more manpower to meet the explosion of a particular region or sudden network platform.
而餐饮行业炒菜制作的出餐效率低，灵活调整也不一定容易。
And the restaurant industry cooking cooking efficiency is low, flexible adjustment is not necessarily easy.
图 / Pexels另外是堂食跟外卖的差别。
Picture / Pexels also shows the difference between Don and take-out.
张宏提到，这两种形式各自的效率是一定的，西贝这种传统餐饮企业，更多的份额在堂食，而一些茶饮企业像瑞幸咖啡一开始占据的就是互联网外送区域，店铺面积很小，有的甚至没有堂食区域，房租要远低于大型餐饮的房租，其次它是标准化作业，即使是一个兼职大学生，按照配方比例把东西加进去就可以，无外乎就是要增加出仓的效率。
Some tea-drinking companies, like Ruixin, start out by taking up Internet delivery areas, with small shops and even no dining areas, and rent is much lower than big meals. Second, it is standardised, even if a part-time college student adds things in proportion to the formula, just to make it more efficient.
“所以从饮品行业来看，一开始其实就是在做外带、线上生意。
"So from the point of view of the beverage industry, the beginning is actually doing take-out, online business.
只是从近几年开始，喜茶、奈雪的茶等做大了，有了一些堂食的性质，但事实上堂食的人并没有那么多，外卖的出单量可能都大于它堂食的出单量。
Only since the beginning of recent years, tea wedding tea, snow, and so on to do large, with some of the nature of parlour, but in fact not so many people, take-out sales may be larger than its orders.
”张宏表示。
'he says.
不过，他认为网上业务依赖于外部配送，因为疫情影响，配送供不应求是一个问题，尤其现在外卖不能进小区，挑战还是很大。
However, he said the online business depends on external distribution because of the impact of the epidemic, distribution demand is a problem, especially now that take-out can not enter the community, the challenge is still very large.
“而且，饮品从严格意义上来讲并不是刚需，不吃饭不行，不喝奶茶可能忍一忍也就过去了，或者有可乐、雪碧做替代。
"Besides, drinks are not strictly necessary, not eating, not drinking milk tea may be over, or cola, snow as a substitute.
”张宏预测，相比餐饮，茶饮行业的苏醒期更快，而且复工之后可能还会出现短期内的一个小的“报复性消费”，但延续的时间不会很长，大多数人出于解馋，两三周之后就趋于平常了。
Zhang Hong predicts that the tea-drinking industry has a faster wake-up period than restaurants and may resume work with a small "retaliatory consumption" in the short term, but not for a long time, with most people coming down to business in two or three weeks for reasons of greed.
不过纯商圈的店铺可能还是需要疫情结束，大家真的愿意走出去逛商场的时候才能恢复。
However, the pure business world may still need to end the epidemic, we are really willing to go shopping when the time to recover.
谁能攒好线上流量谁就有机会胜出虽无远虑，但有近忧。
Who can save the line on the flow of those who have a chance to win, although not far-sighted, but there are immediate concerns.
在目前的形势下，张烨秋认为茶饮企业首先要关注现金流的问题，所有的线下模式现在现金流都很紧张，融资是第一关键的事情，不要太在意估值。
In the current situation, Zhang Yeqiu thinks that tea drinking enterprises should pay attention to cash flow first and all off-line models are very tight right now. Financing is the most important thing.
而坚持要做线下的企业，应该暂不开店，采取适量裁员、协商降低房租、和其它业态共享员工等方式尽可能的去降低成本。
Firms that insist on being offline should try to cut costs as much as possible by cutting jobs, negotiating lower rents and sharing employees with other businesses.
在他看来，现在是投资机构的好机会。
In his view, this was a good time for investment institutions.
“以前投不进去或估值很高的餐饮企业现在能捡便宜。
"Restaurants that used to be inaccessible or have high valuations are now able to pick up the bargain.
因为企业遇到了一个紧急但不重要的问题，它的现金流很短缺，但是从长远来看它是一个特别好的资产，目前是价格洼地。
It has a cash flow shortage because it has an urgent but unimportant problem, but it is a particularly good asset in the long run, and it is now a low-priced one.
”此外，他认为还是会有一波聪明的企业知道怎么去利用好这波流量。
Still, he thinks, there will be a wave of smart companies that know how to take advantage of the flow.
等疫情过去，大家出来玩的时候，选择哪个商家可能就取决于这两个月谁把线上流量攒得更好。
When the epidemic is over and everyone comes out to play, the choice of vendors may depend on who gets better online traffic over the past two months.
他举例，比如商家可以在线教用户做几款茶饮产品，和生鲜电商平台比如叮咚买菜合作配送原料，今天在家学了，明天就能配送到你家，还能帮生鲜电商平台引流。
For example, businesses can teach users to make several tea drinks online, and send ingredients to live electronics vendors such as Ding Dong Buying, which are available at home today, will be delivered to your home tomorrow, and will help channel fresh electric business platforms.
商家还可以做活动让用户积分抵现金，后续到店消费，也可以用抽奖或兑换的形式，把这波流量都攒到四、五月份去释放。
Businesses can also do activities so that users credit cash, follow-up to store consumption, or the form of a raffle or exchange, the wave of traffic to save in April and May to release.
品牌在线下有流量，用户愿意关注，转到线上也是优质内容，这一波是做品牌的好机会。
Brand online traffic, users are willing to pay attention, to the line is also high-quality content, this wave is a good opportunity to do brand.
张宏也提到，如果真的有企业能分享出一些自己的配方，让用户自己在家做出好喝的饮品，会起到收买人心的效果，是一个好的营销方式。
Zhang Hong also mentioned that if there are enterprises can share some of their own recipes, let users make good drinks at home, will have the effect of buying people, is a good way of marketing.
用户对品牌的认知度、忠诚度会更高，当人们出去之后，更愿意去购买这个品牌的饮品。
Users will be more aware of the brand, loyalty will be higher, when people go out, more willing to buy this brand of drinks.
不仅如此，疫情下企业也可以在产品上创新。
Moreover, firms can innovate in products in the face of an epidemic.
“如果能研发出速溶饮品，即使有特殊情况，只要保证货源不断，人们可以像香飘飘奶茶一样购买、存货，只要调出来的味道跟店铺一样，实际上完全成了线上零售，不会受到店铺、资金、人员压力的影响。
"If instant drinks can be developed, even under special circumstances, people can buy and stock as sweet milk tea, even if there are special circumstances, as long as it is kept afloat. As long as it tastes like a store, it is virtually an online retailer, unaffected by store, financial and human pressures.
”张宏说。
'he said.
另外，行业逐渐恢复之后，企业在员工的调派上要更着重办公区域的店铺，因为它可能会伴随着大量订单的引入。
In addition, as the industry recovers, companies will have to focus more on office-area stores in the deployment of staff, as it may be accompanied by the introduction of large numbers of orders.
通过这次疫情，企业也应该去做更多复合型店铺，店铺面积小、更加灵活、人员更少，成本可控。
Through this epidemic, enterprises should also do more complex shops, shop size, more flexible, less staff, cost control.
图 / Pexels“我看到很多创始人沉浸在自己线上流量大规模暴涨的兴奋期中，但我觉得这是一个很危险的事，大多数人没有想好怎么去承接，怎么借助这波流量红利让自己的项目完成质变，而仅仅是DAU涨了3倍、5倍，不去想长期的成绩，只做了运营，没有做产品和服务能力的优化。
Figure / Pexels "I've seen a lot of founders immersed in the excitement of their online traffic skyrocketing, but I think it's a dangerous thing for most people not to figure out how to take on the flow dividend to get their projects to a qualitative change, but just triple and fivefold without thinking about long-term results, just doing operations and not optimizing product and service capabilities.
”张烨秋说。
"Zhang Yeqiu said.
他认为，目前来看，可能大家会觉得是线上的红利，线下的危机。
At the moment, he thinks, it may feel like an online dividend, an offline crisis.
但可能长期来看，可能是线上的危机和线下的红利，这取决于创始人有没有能力把握这个机会。
But in the long run, it could be online crises and offline dividends, depending on the founders' ability to seize the opportunity.
毕竟，用速度拼出来的规模，还要靠实力还回去。
After all, the scale of the spellings of speed has to be repaid by strength.
