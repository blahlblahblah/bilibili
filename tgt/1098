“听武汉这边的同事说，每年的3到4月，这里的樱花开得非常漂亮，到时我们一起来看樱花啊？”“一定一定！”配图 | golo前  言这是一场战争，在新年的伊始，爆发在每一个普通的、平凡的中国人身边。
"Colleagues from this part of Wuhan say that the cherry blossoms are blooming beautifully every year from March to April, when we will come to see the cherry blossoms?" & # 160; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
这是我们的战争，我们热切地讨论、谨慎地分析，为灾难中陨落的生命而痛惜，为医者大无畏的精神所感动，为我们能为之所做的点滴小事而不懈努力。
This is our war, and we enthusiastically discussed, carefully analyzed, lamented the loss of life in the disaster, moved by the fearless spirit of the healer, and worked tirelessly for the little things we could do for it.
人生海海，我们且行且惜。
Life is a sea, and we cherish it.
网易人间「我们的战争」特辑，讲述每一天，我们与疫情赤膊相见。
The Netease World "Our War" feature tells us about each day and we are not exposed to the epidemic.
我们的战争丨连载13陈鑫是我的同事，2009年，我俩先后从中心派出所调到刑侦大队。
Our war into the 13 Chen Xin is my colleague, in 2009, we were transferred from the central police station to the investigation brigade.
他的妻子是省里一所著名医院的重症监护室护士，疫情来临，奋战在城市安防一线的陈鑫，把妻子送上了驰援武汉的车。
His wife is a well-known hospital in the province of intensive care nurses, the outbreak of the outbreak, fighting in the city security line Chen Xin, his wife was sent to help Wuhan car.
1月21日中午收到妻子发来的微信时，陈鑫一时有点不敢相信。
When he received the message from his wife at noon on January 21, Chen Xin could not believe it for a moment.
先是一张通知截图：“接上级通知，我院重症监护室需抽调5名技术熟练、素质过硬的护士人员前往武汉抗击疫情，有意愿者可往护士长处报名。
First of all, a notice screenshot: "To accept the superior's notice, our hospital intensive care unit need to transfer 5 skilled, qualified nurses to Wuhan to fight the epidemic situation, those who wish to register with the head nurse.
”紧跟着就是妻子说的：“我想报名参加。
"The next thing my wife said was," I want to enroll.
”陈鑫看了看时间，快1点了，还有半个小时就要开专案会了，这信息该怎么回？离除夕只有2天了，虽然人可以放假，但案子却不能“放假”。
"Chen Xin looked at the time, nearly 1 o'clock, there is half an hour to open the project, this information how to respond? New Year's Eve only 2 days, although people can have holidays, but the case can not" holiday.
在全国扫黑除恶行动开展得如火如荼的这一年，作为重案中队中队长的陈鑫一直马不停蹄，办理涉黑涉恶案件的同时，还兼负着命案积案的侦破工作。
Chen Xin, who is the squadron leader of the serious crime squadron, has been handling cases involving black and evil, as well as the detection of the backlog of cases involving homicide.
临近春节，专案组又召集全部相关人员开会，一来讨论下一步工作如何开展，二来也给专案民警排个春节的班——这也就意味着，这个假期中，陈鑫能有2天休息就不错了。
In the run-up to the Spring Festival, the panel again called together all the relevant people to discuss the way forward and set up a Spring Festival class for the police ad hoc, which meant Chen could rest for two days during the holiday.
收到妻子的信息前，他心里满满计划的都是该怎么利用好这宝贵的休假时间。
Before receiving his wife's message, he was preoccupied with how to make the most of his precious vacation time.
眼下，却全部被突如其来的疫情打乱了。
Right now, it's all being disrupted by a sudden outbreak.
这几天，街上戴口罩的人越来越多，妻子加班时间也明显越来越长了。
More and more people are wearing masks on the streets these days, and it is becoming apparent that wives are working longer hours.
虽然一切尚无定论，但会议中，已经有同事戴上口罩了。
Although all is not decided, but in the meeting, some colleagues have put on masks.
散会后，陈鑫再次打开手机时，看到妻子又发来了一张图，那是一张“请战书”，落款人是妻子的名字，名字上面还有上一枚鲜红的手印—— 已经如此了，还是支持一下妻子吧，不然怎么办呢，请战书都写好了。
After the meeting, Chen Xin again opened the phone, see his wife sent a map, it is a "war invitation," the name of his wife, the name of a bright red handprint - has been so, or support his wife, or what else to do, please write the letter of battle.
很快，妻子又发来了一条信息：“崽崽怎么办？”是啊，家里还有两个崽啊。
Soon, his wife sent another message, "What about Puppies?" Yes, there are two pups in the family.
自己到底是不是个好丈夫？结婚后的陈鑫偶尔也会想这个问题。
Is he a good husband after marriage Chen Xin occasionally think about this issue.
妻子是同学介绍认识的，在一起谈了1年多恋爱，2010年4月结了婚。
My wife was introduced to me by my classmates, and I fell in love with her for more than a year.
要说两人最相配的地方，就是彼此都是不折不扣的工作狂——经常加班。
The best match for the two of them is that they are literally workaholics -- working overtime.
当然，这也是两个人工作性质决定的。
This, of course, is also determined by the nature of their work.
陈鑫结婚时觉得自己尤其幸运，找了一个护士，“警察与护士，绝配，都是救人嘛！”那时，他还对我们打趣说：“护士多好，有护理经验，这下生崽和带崽都有人包了。
Chen Xin felt particularly lucky when he got married and found a nurse. "Police and nurses are perfect match for saving lives." At that time, he joked to us: "Nurses are so good, they have nursing experience.
而且自己是医院的，生崽时也不用托人找关系弄床位了。
And I'm in the hospital and I don't have to ask for a bed when I give birth.
”结果等到他第二个孩子出生时，还真是妻子自己去找的床位。
"By the time his second child was born, it was really the bed his wife had gone to find for herself.
那是2017年6月的一天，下着大雨。
It was one day in June 2017, and it rained heavily.
陈鑫当时主办了一起恶性抢劫案，等完成抓捕再看手机时，已是早上8点——更要命的是，手机上有妻子打来的无数个未接来电。
When Chen Xin hosted a vicious robbery, it was eight o'clock in the morning when he made the arrest and looked at the cellphone - and even worse, there were countless uncalled calls from his wife.
他这才想起来，前一天晚上搞审讯时，为了避免打扰，把手机设置成了静音，结果忘记改回来。
It occurred to him that he had set his cell phone to silence in order to avoid disturbance during the interrogation the previous evening and had forgotten to change back.
再看微信，战战兢兢地点开妻子留下的几条语音，第一句就是一阵厉声的咒骂：“崽就快要生了，还找不到你人，你干脆死在外面得了！”算一算，妻子的预产期就是这两天，爸妈正好回了乡下，只有妻子和大崽在家。
The first sentence was a sharp oath: "Puppy is about to give birth, and will not find you, you will die outside!" The calculation, the wife's expected due date is these two days, parents just return to the countryside, only his wife and Pup at home.
陈鑫顿时冒出一额头的冷汗，再点下一条语音时，尽管依旧是咒骂，但他多少安定了一点：“你听到后，赶快到**医院来，我和崽都在医院。
"Chen Xin burst out of a cold sweat on his forehead and ordered another voice, though still cursing, he was more or less reassured:" When you hear this, come to the * * Hospital.
”“我老婆要生崽了，你们把人押回队里去，注意安全。
"My wife is going to have a baby. You have to take the men back to the team.
”陈鑫转头对着其他兄弟喊了一句，话还没说完，就跳进车里出发了。
"Chen Xin turned his head to the other brothers shouted, before he finished, jumped into the car and started out.
当时他心里还庆幸了一下：“幸好这次是开着自己的车，这恐怕是‘私车公用’唯一的福利了。
At the time, he was glad that he was driving his car this time. I'm afraid it was the only benefit of private car use.
”赶到医院，找到妻子的病房，推门就看见妻子好好的躺在床上，大崽坐在一旁看着电视，陈鑫的心里才安定了下来。
Rushing to the hospital and finding his wife's room, he pushed the door and saw his wife lying in bed.
妻子见到他，连声发问：“你还要崽不？你还要老婆不？”原来今天早上7点多，妻子起床上厕所时，突然发现自己破水了。
When his wife saw him, she asked him, "Do you want more cubs? Do you want a wife?" It was 7: 00 this morning, when she got up to go to the bathroom, she suddenly found herself breaking water.
一般来讲，孩子要生了的话，先是“见红”，如果已经破了水，产妇就必须平躺，并立刻入院，且不能再乱活动了，不然羊水流失太多，胎儿就危险了。
Generally speaking, if the child wants to have a baby, first "see red", if already broken water, the mother must lie down, and immediately hospitalized, and can no longer chaos activities, otherwise the amniotic fluid loss too much, the fetus is dangerous.
虽然妻子是护士，没有那么慌张，而且待产的物品也已准备妥当，可当时家里除了个不到7岁的小孩，就只有妻子自己一个人，难免诸多不便。
Although the wife was a nurse, she was not so flustered and the things to be delivered were ready, but she was the only one in the family except for a seven-year-old.
打陈鑫的电话，拨通了没人接，一直打，一直没人接。
Chen Xin calls, dialed nobody answered, has been playing, has not been answered.
想着叫辆“滴滴”，但此刻正值上班早高峰，怎么也叫不到车——妻子整个人都要崩溃了：总不能自己一个人挣扎着拖着东西、牵着孩子去路边等的士吧？最后没别的办法，妻子打电话给了同事，还是同事开着车将母子二人接到了医院。
I was thinking of calling a drip, but it was early morning rush hour, and I couldn't get a car - my wife was crumbling: I couldn't shuffle my things and take my baby to the roadside to wait for a taxi.
安排床位、挂号、缴费都是同事帮忙处理的。
The arrangement of beds, registration and payment of fees are handled by colleagues.
第二天上午，孩子就出生了。
The next morning, the baby was born.
“看来自己真不算个好丈夫。
"I don't think I'm a very good husband.
”每次说起这件事，陈鑫都是满脸愧疚。
"Every time he talks about it, Chen Xin looks guilty.
但我知道，他的妻子也是理解他的——后来我们一起去看望他妻子时，她只是和我们教导员开玩笑说：“您看陈鑫是不是该挨处分？老婆都要生崽了，他还在办案，典型的要工作不要崽咧！”对于陈鑫而言，懂得妻子工作的重担，还是被妻子拉着一起看了《急诊室的故事》之后的事了。
But I know his wife understands him, too - when we went to see his wife later, she only joked with our tutor: "Do you think Chen Xin should be punished? His wife is giving birth to cubs.
在妻子工作的重症监护室里，一条条生命就摆在那，只能竭尽全力地去救。
In the intensive care unit of the wife's work, life is placed there, can only do their best to save.
“今天的夜班如同往常一样，琐碎而繁重。
"The night shift is as trivial and heavy as ever.
上药、记录病情数据、查看呼吸机，甚至还要与有意识的病人说说话，一个晚上下来几乎没有合眼。
Taking medication, keeping track of illness data, checking the respirator, and even talking to conscious patients almost never close their eyes at night.
这里每一个病人都病情严重，真心不敢马虎，此时我的脑袋也有些炸炸的作痛，多坚持一下，也许就在下一秒，病人身上就会产生奇迹。
Every patient here is seriously ill, do not dare carelessly, at this time my head is also some of the pain, more adhere to, perhaps in the next second, patients will be miraculous.
”看着妻子的朋友圈，陈鑫一脸酸楚。
"Looking at his wife's circle of friends, Chen Xin a sour face.
他隐约感觉到，中午发微信给自己的时候，妻子心里应该是有些害怕的——疫情的严重性日渐显现，医护人员被传染的消息也开始传来——只是妻子没对他说罢了。
He was vaguely aware that his wife must have been a little frightened when he delivered the letter at noon - the severity of the outbreak was becoming more apparent and the news of the spread of the disease began to spread - only his wife didn't say anything to him.
就像曾经，自己遇到危险，除非受了明显的外伤，实在瞒不住了，不然也不会向妻子提起一样。
As in the past, I have not been able to conceal my danger from my wife unless I have seen it through.
谁都是血肉之躯。
All men are flesh and blood.
虽然经常在办案一线冲锋陷阵，但说没感到害怕，那是假的。
Although often in the front line of the case, but said no fear, it is false.
这么多年来，真正让陈鑫感觉到害怕的时刻，也发生过两回。
So many years, really let Chen Xin feel the moment of fear, also happened twice.
一次是2010年，他刚进刑侦队不到1年。
One was in 2010, less than a year after he had entered the Criminal Investigation Unit.
案件起因是一起债务纠纷，一个自称“老叔”的人带着一伙人向对方要债时，双方发生冲突，没想老叔当场掏出手枪，“呯”地冲着屋内的一个皮沙发就是一枪。
The case arose out of a debt dispute in which a man claiming to be an "old man" and a group of people demanded money from each other. The two sides clashed and did not think that the old man had pulled out a pistol and plunked into a leather sofa inside the house.
看着沙发上那个圆圆的弹孔，对方立刻被吓住了，乖乖地还了钱，并附上高额利息。
Looking at the round bullet hole on the sofa, the other party was immediately scared, obediently pay back the money, with high interest.
接到报案后，刑侦大队领导是高度重视，参与抓捕的成员一律带枪，主攻队员全穿了防弹衣。
Upon receiving a report, the head of the criminal investigation brigade is highly valued, the members involved in the arrest are all carrying guns, the main attack all wearing body armour.
老叔的落脚点在一个酒店，根据情报，人就带着2个马仔住在3楼的房间里。
The old man was staying in a hotel and, according to the information, he was living with two paparazzi in a room on the third floor.
在确定嫌疑人还在房间后，根据分工，抓捕队员分别对酒店出入口、电梯口等地布置了人员，最后由大队长带着陈鑫他们5人一起来到了门外。
After ascertaining that the suspect was still in the room, according to the division of labor, the arresting party arranged personnel at the entrance and exit of the hotel and the entrance of the elevator.
在酒店工作人员的帮助下，房门被迅速打开，3名队员持枪从不同的角度冲了进去：“全部抱头蹲下！”陈鑫自己没有配枪，跟在大队长后面冲了进去。
With the help of the hotel staff, the door was opened quickly, and three members of the team rushed in from different angles: "All hands down!" Chen Xin, without a gun, rushed in after the captain.
当时在房内有3人，其中2个年轻的马仔已经抱头蹲下，但是躺在床上的老叔突然一个翻身，手伸到枕头下想掏什么东西。
There were three people in the room, two of whom were already crouching on their heads, but the old man in bed suddenly rolled over and reached under his pillow for something.
陈鑫跃身一扑，直接压在老叔身上，伸手就抓住了他伸进枕头里的手，指尖瞬间感受到一阵金属的冰凉。
Chen Xin jumps a body, press directly on the old uncle body, reach for him to reach into the hand of the pillow, fingertip instantly feel a cold metal.
一时间，他的大脑一片空白，只想着按住老叔的手。
For a moment, his brain was blank, trying to hold his uncle's hand.
整个过程只有几秒钟，当听到同事一声厉喝“再不松手，就开枪了！”、被压在身下的老叔没有继续挣扎时，陈鑫才回过神来，从枕头下抓住一把“仿六四”。
The whole process only a few seconds, when heard a colleague to "never let go of the hand, shot!", was pressed under the old uncle did not continue to struggle, Chen Xin just recovered from the pillow to grasp a "copy of 64."
他迅速退出弹夹，拉开套筒，一颗金灿灿的子弹从枪内弹出——子弹居然上膛了。
Quickly he pulled out of the cartridge, pulled back the sleeve, and a golden bullet popped out of the gun -- the bullet was loaded.
事后陈鑫问老叔：“你当时会不会真的开枪？”老叔回答：“我绝对不敢开枪，我犯的罪不是死罪，如果我开枪的话，不被你们现场打死，也铁定会被判死刑，我没那么傻，我害怕死。
After the incident, Chen Xin asked the old man, "Would you have really fired?" The old man replied, "I would never dare to shoot. My crime is not a capital crime.
”但在抓捕的那一刻，谁都无法判断。
But no one can judge at the moment of the arrest.
陈鑫后来一次害怕，是主办一起入室盗窃案。
Chen Xin later fear, is to host a burglary.
当时他已经是中队长了，在获知该伙嫌疑人的落脚点后，带着几个兄弟前去抓捕。
He was already a squadron leader and, after learning the whereabouts of the group of suspects, went to arrest him with several brothers.
前期侦查中，大家已确定这伙嫌疑人是一个成年人带着一群16、7岁的未成年人，因此抓捕时重点控制对象就是那个成年人，没有针对其他人员做专门布置。
During the preliminary investigation, it was established that the group of suspects was an adult with a group of 16 or 7-year-old minors, so the focus of the arrest was on the adult and no special arrangements were made for the other persons.
破门很顺利，兄弟们很快就把屋内的人控制住，那个为首的成年嫌疑人也戴上了手铐，剩下的年纪不大的嫌疑人们一个个吓得瑟瑟发抖。
The door was broken smoothly, and the brothers soon took control of the house, and the principal adult suspect was handcuffed, and the rest of the young suspects trembled with terror.
主要人员控制了，大家也相对放松了，但万万没想到，当一个队员在给一个小嫌疑人戴手铐时，那个小子居然从身后摸出一瓶催泪喷雾剂对着警员脸上喷。
Key personnel were in control and everyone was relatively relaxed, but it never occurred to him that when a member of the team was handcuffing a suspect, the boy pulled a bottle of tear spray from behind and sprayed it on the officer's face.
那个队员大叫一声，捂着脸倒在在了地上，陈鑫吓了一跳，马上将那个队员往厕所里拖，打开水龙头，让喷溅的水直冲那队员的脸。
The member yells, covers his face to the ground, Chen Xin jumps, immediately drags the member to the toilet, opens the faucet, lets the spatter directly to the member's face.
整个房间都弥漫着呛人的味道，嫌疑人和队员们都被呛得直打喷嚏，双目泪流。
The room smelled of choking, with suspects and team members sneezing and tears streaming down their eyes.
陈鑫一边让那个队员继续冲洗，一边忍着气味带着弟兄们将嫌疑人全部押出屋子。
Chen Xin on the side of the team to continue to wash, while enduring the smell of the brothers with all the suspects out of the house.
安排好两个情况相对轻的队员看好嫌疑人后，陈鑫忍住难受再次冲进屋子，接了一大桶水，把厕所里的卫生纸全部抓了出来，让屋外的队员洗脸。
After arranging two relatively light players to take care of the suspect, Chen Xin rushed into the house again, took a bucket of water, the toilet paper out of the room to let the team wash their faces.
接着，他也顾不上自己，再次跑进屋子，对着那个直接中招的兄弟喊道：“没事吧？”那个兄弟抬起头，两只眼睛仍是无法睁开，整个脸早已通红。
Then, not caring for himself, he ran into the house again and called to his brother, who had been admitted directly to him, "Is everything all right?" The brother raised his head, his eyes still closed, his face red.
这种催泪喷雾剂陈鑫在警校的查缉战术课上体验过，当时也是在一个屋子里，教官从窗外喷进来催泪喷雾剂，那滋味一辈子都不会忘记。
Chen Xin, a tear-jerking sprayer, experienced it in the police academy's Detective Tactics class, and was in the same room, where the instructor sprayed tear spray through the window, a taste that will never be forgotten.
如此近距离的喷射，对眼睛造成的损伤可想而知。
So close to the injection, the damage to the eyes can be imagined.
收队的路上，陈鑫带着这名队员先去了医院急诊，医生处理完，那名队员才勉强睁开了眼睛，但模模糊糊看不清楚。
On the way out of the team, Chen Xin took the team to the hospital for emergency treatment. After the doctor finished, the player opened his eyes reluctantly but couldn't see clearly.
陈鑫又带他去看了眼科，经检查没有问题时，陈鑫才长长松了一口气。
Chen Xin took him to see ophthalmology, after checking that there was no problem, Chen Xin only long sigh of relief.
审讯时问嫌疑人为什么要这么做，那个穷乡僻野里出来、只有16岁的孩子说：“我们老大说了，不能被警察抓住，抓住了会被枪毙。
When questioned as to why the suspect did so, the 16-year-old boy from the remote countryside said, "Our boss told us that we can't get caught by the police, and we're going to be shot.
我怕死的。
I'm afraid of death.
”后来，陈鑫每次见到那名队员脸上因催泪喷雾剂灼伤而长出的痂时，心里就万分难过。
Chen Xin felt very sad every time he saw the scab on the player's face caused by tear-jerking spray.
民警执行抓捕时遇到的恶性事件层出不穷，的确，这份工作就要直面生死，用同事们的话说，一旦出了事，就是“黑白照片圈上一圈菊花，孤儿寡母、老父老母在灵堂上哭得撕心裂肺”。
In fact, this job has to face the life and death, in the words of colleagues, is "a circle of black and white photographs of chrysanthemum, widows, fatherless parents in the hall tears tears."
可是也正是因着这份害怕，陈鑫心里才会想着，不严厉打击罪犯，以后自己怎么放心让孩子出门？想到这里，陈鑫也觉得，妻子应该和自己一样——如果不把疫情消灭，或许自己和孩子都会成为其中一个黑色的、冰冷的数字。
But it is also because of this fear, Chen Xin will think, do not severely crack down on criminals, how can he let his children go out? Thought of here, Chen Xin also felt that his wife should be the same - if not eliminated, perhaps their own children will become one of the black, cold figures.
也就是因为这份害怕，才选择要第一时间冲在最前面吧。
Is also because of this fear, only to choose the first time to rush in the front bar.
“你最终还是同意她去了吧？”我小心翼翼地问道。
"Did you finally agree to her going?" I asked warily.
“‘全力支持！’——这是我当时给她的答复。
'Full support! '- that was my answer to her then.
”陈鑫很平静地回答。
"Chen Xin replied quietly.
那天当妻子回家时，满脸的思绪重重，陈鑫很明显就感觉到了。
When his wife came home that day, his face was full of thoughts, Chen Xin obviously felt it.
一边是三天两头不在家的丈夫、两个小儿；一边是自己救死扶伤的职责以及凶险重重的疫区。
On one side is her absent husband for three days and two children; on the other is her duty to save her life and her wounds.
当陈鑫将自己的决定告诉妻子时，想必是给了妻子最大的支持——“她当时皱起的眉头一下子就平了，人也显得轻松很多”。
When Chen Xin told his wife about her decision, she must have given her the biggest support - "her frown flattened out and she looked much more relaxed."
“孩子们怎么安排呢？”我又问了一句，话出口，又觉得有些多余。
"How do the children arrange it?" I asked again, feeling a little superfluous.
“还能怎么办？只能丢给爸妈了。
"What else can I do? Just leave it to Mom and Dad.
现在家里没个老人，还真的会乱得一团糟。
There's no old man in the house now, and it's a real mess.
别说这次她去武汉，就是平时两个人加班时，我爸妈也经常是抱着小崽去接大崽，真是难为两个老人家了。
Not to mention this time she went to Wuhan, is usually two people working overtime, my parents are often carrying their cubs to pick up cubs, really difficult for the two old people.
”“再说两个崽，小的不懂事就不说了，大的还真的懂事。
"" Besides, the two little ones will not talk about it, and the big one will really understand.
当时我老婆和他说要去支援武汉时，这小子居然也特别支持他妈妈，还说他以后可以在同学面前挺起胸脯说他有个英雄妈妈了。
When my wife told him to support Wuhan, the boy even supported his mother and said that he could stand up in front of his classmates and say he had a heroic mother.
说实在的，我也有那么多奖励，为啥这小子就是看不见呢？”说起孩子，陈鑫才露出了满脸的笑意。
To tell the truth, I also have so many awards, why is this boy just can't see? "Speaking of children, Chen Xin only revealed a smile on his face.
1月25日，大年初一。
January 25, New Year's Day.
一大早陈鑫的妻子就去了单位参加院方组织的动员会。
Early in the morning Chen Xin's wife went to the unit to participate in the organization of the mobilization meeting.
下午4点多才回来收拾行李。
I didn't come back to pack until after 4 pm.
陈鑫拿出两罐士力架递给妻子。
Chen Xin took out two cans of stacks and handed them to his wife.
他看过相关新闻和内容，说武汉的医护人员忙起来根本没时间吃饭，士力架扛饿，想来自己蹲点守候时也常吃这个，就专门去买给妻子。
He read related news and content, said that Wuhan medical personnel busy up to have no time to eat, Shi Li Jie hungry, would like to squat when they often eat this, go to buy his wife.
大年初二，为了不吵醒家人，陈鑫和妻子起了个大早，两人很快洗漱完毕，拖着行李箱要出门。
New Year's Day, in order not to wake up the family, Chen Xin and his wife got up early, they quickly washed up, dragged luggage to go out.
陈鑫说，那个早晨，他一直有点想哭：“当时想着起得早，不会有事。
Chen Xin said that morning, he had been a little bit like crying: "I thought to get up early, it will be all right.
结果出门时，大崽也起来了，抱着妈妈的腿不肯松手，妻子亲了他额头一下，并嘱咐他照顾好弟弟时，大崽就懂事地点了点头……孩子太懂事，也不一定是好事啊！”到了医院门口，妻子非要一人拖着行李去科室，不让陈鑫送，说是怕自己会哭。
When the cub got up and took his mother by the leg, the wife kissed him on the forehead and told him to take good care of the younger brother... The baby was too sensible and not necessarily a good thing.
过了两个小时，陈鑫收到妻子发来的照片：一张是她们出征的护士一人手中拿着一张写春联用的红纸，每张红纸上一个苍劲的毛笔字，组合起来就是：“出征武汉，不畏艰难！”另一张，是妻子举起右手宣誓的照片。
Two hours later, Chen Xin received a picture from his wife. One of them was a nurse carrying a red paper for the Spring Festival couplets. Each piece of red paper had a strong handwriting: "If you go out in Wuhan, don't fear hardship!
妻子走后的这几天，陈鑫心里总觉得有点空，又不敢打电话给妻子，一来怕影响她工作，二来怕影响她休息，只能常常在微信里给妻子留言。
After his wife left, Chen Xin always feel a bit empty, and afraid to call his wife, on the one hand, afraid to affect her work, on the other hand, afraid to affect her rest, can only often in the micro-letter message to his wife.
妻子回的信息很少，内容基本上都是“疫情很严重”，“崽不要出门”，“一定要戴好口罩”之类的话。
His wife returned very little information, basically said "very serious epidemic", "Pup do not go out," "Be sure to wear a mask," and so on.
按照上级指示，公安机关为防治疫情已经提前上了好几天班了。
According to the superior's instructions, the public security organs have been on duty for several days to prevent and control the epidemic.
大年初九，大队长神情凝重地将几个中队长召集到办公室。
On the ninth day of the year, the captain solemnly convened several squadrons to his office.
“现在区里已有确诊病人，并且这个病人的家属也已经出现了疑似症状，现这些人全在南区疾控医院进行隔离。
"There have been confirmed cases in the district and the patient's family has developed suspected symptoms. All of them are being quarantined at the South Side CDC.
为了弄清楚这些人去过哪些地方、接触过哪些人群，区里专门指示我们刑侦大队负责开展询问工作。
In order to find out where these people have been and who they have been in contact with, the district has instructed our criminal investigation brigade to carry out inquiries.
询问结束后还可能被隔离。
They may also be quarantined after questioning.
当然，带队的肯定是我，另外还需要3人。
Of course, it must be me who leads the team, and three more.
”大队长顿了顿，“教导员和几个副大队长排除在外，我不在队里时，你们几个要负责大队的业务和管理工作。
"The captain paused." The head coach and several lieutenants are excluded, and when I am not on the team, you will be responsible for the operation and management of the brigade.
”话音刚落，所有中队长都举起了手。
"Just as the words fell, all the squadrons raised their hands.
下午2点，大队长便带着陈鑫和另外两名中队长到了医院，进了门后，4人取出事先准备好的口罩、护目镜和防护服，正准备穿上，负责对接的医院负责人看了他们的装备后，说他们医院的防护服效果好一些，让他们更换。
At 2: 00 p.m., the captain took Chen Xin and two other squadrons to the hospital. After entering the door, the four men took out their masks, goggles and protective clothing, and were ready to put them on.
防护服效果好，自然意味着衣服更厚实、更不透气。
Protective clothing works well, which naturally means clothes are thicker and less breathable.
全副武装后，陈鑫顿时感觉到憋气，努力喘了几大口气后，才能勉强适应过来。
Fully equipped, Chen Xin immediately feel suffocated, trying to take a few breath after, can barely adapt to it.
走进隔离区，看着那些被隔离的病人，陈鑫更加明白了妻子当下所面临的处境，不直接感受，真的不知道竟是如此艰难！陈鑫负责询问的是一位50多岁的男性，是那例确诊病人的岳父——他女婿在湖北做生意，这次过年回来拜年。
When Chen Xin walked into the quarantine zone and looked at the patients who were isolated, Chen Xin understood more about the situation his wife is now facing, and really didn't know how hard it was! Chen Xin asked a man in his fifties, the father-in-law of the confirmed patient, to do business in Hubei Province.
由于是在封城前回来的，所以一家人也没在意，结果自己全家都出现了症状。
The family did not care because they came back before the closure of the city. As a result, the whole family developed symptoms.
询问的全程，这位病人都在剧烈地咳嗽，喉咙里还发出一种接不上气的“嘶嘶”声。
The patient coughed violently throughout the interrogation, and there was a gasping "hissing" sound in his throat.
为了能够提上气，病人时不时捶着胸口，隔着口罩和防护服，气流都直接冲在了陈鑫的身上。
In order to be able to lift the gas, patients occasionally hit chest, across the mask and protective clothing, the air flow directly rushed to Chen Xin body.
随后制作笔录的过程也不太顺利，所有人说不上两句话，就要猛烈咳一阵子，几个中队长都只能坐在对面，耐心地等着。
The subsequent transcription was not so smooth that everyone could not say two words without a hacking cough, and several squadrons had to sit opposite each other and wait patiently.
询问完毕后，再让被询问人反复确认着记录内容，直到被询问人最终确定，工作才算结束。
After the questioning, the interviewee is asked to confirm the content of the record over and over again until the interviewee finalizes the record.
等彻底消毒、走出隔离区、脱下防护服时，所有人的后背都已经湿透了。
By the time they were thoroughly disinfected, out of the quarantine zone, and had taken off their protective clothing, everyone was wet through the back.
陈鑫他们都进行了专项检测，慎重起见，分局又给他们在宾馆安排了单独隔离的房间，并联系了疾控中心，对他们定期进行检测，直至风险全部排除。
Chen Xin they have carried out special tests, as a precaution, the sub-station arranged for them in a separate hotel room, and contact the CDC, they are regularly tested until the risk has been completely eliminated.
我问陈鑫，在隔离的这几天里，有没有和妻子联系过？他说，通过两次电话，是妻子打给他的，说的内容没啥特别的，无非就是病人多，情况严重，要他注意。
I asked Chen Xin if he had been in touch with his wife in the past few days of isolation. He said that his wife called him on two phone calls and said nothing special except that there were so many patients and serious cases that he should pay attention to.
陈鑫还特地让我看了下他与妻子的聊天记录，是他妻子发来的一张图片，一根被咬了一截的士力架，还配了一条文字：“吃着你的士力架，真的要长胖了。
Chen Xin also let me look at his wife's chat records, is his wife sent a picture, a piece of a bit of the strength of the shelf, with a text: "eat your Siselian, really will grow fat.
”“不怕不怕，回来后把肥减下去。
"" No fear of losing weight when you come back.
到时我陪你一起去健身房。
I'll accompany you to the gym then.
”“听武汉这边的同事说，每年的3到4月，这里的樱花开得非常漂亮，到时我们一起来看樱花啊？”“一定一定！”我想陈鑫在敲下“一定一定”四个字时，肯定用了很大的力气。
"Listen to colleagues on this side of Wuhan said that every year between March and April, the cherry blossoms here are very beautiful, when we will come to see the cherry blossoms together?"
