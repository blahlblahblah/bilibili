宣称30分钟甚至是15分钟内可实现快速检测的试剂大多是牺牲了部分性能来换取速度的提升2020年2月3日，江苏省某生物科技公司，生产人员进行试剂成品包装。
Most of the reagents that claim to be ready for rapid testing within 30 minutes or even 15 minutes are sacrificing some performance to gain speed on February 3, 2020, a Jiangsu Province biotechnology company, production personnel carry out reagent packaging.
中新社发 汤德宏 摄自新冠疫情发生以来，受试剂盒和实验室数量等因素的限制，武汉大量疑似患者无法确诊。
Because of the limitation of the number of kits and laboratories, a large number of suspected patients in Wuhan can not be diagnosed.
近日，武汉对所有疑似患者进行核酸检测“清零”，检测能力从最初每日200份，提升至每日8000份。
Wuhan recently tested positive for nucleic acid in all suspected patients, up from an initial 200 a day to 8,000 a day.
疫情当下，大量疑似患者、无症状感染者等待排查诊断，使得相关检测产品需求急迫。
At present, a large number of suspected patients, asymptomatic infection waiting for diagnosis, making the need for relevant detection products urgent.
2月8日，科技部发布《新型冠状病毒(2019-nCoV)现场快速检测产品研发应急项目申报指南的通知》（简称《指南》），旨在突破现有检测技术对人员、检测场所等条件的限制，提升加快检测效率和便捷性，有利于对疑似患者的快速诊断和密切接触人群的现场筛查。
On February 8, the Ministry of Science and Technology issued the Circular on Guidelines for Reporting Emergency Projects for the Development of New Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Field Rapid Detection Products (hereinafter referred to as "the Guide"), which aims to break through the existing restrictions on personnel, testing sites and other conditions, enhance the efficiency and expediency of detection, and facilitate rapid diagnosis of suspected patients and on-site screening of people in close contact.
此次科技部征集的应急快检产品，均要求一至两周内完成产品研发，最晚一个半月取得临床证书，并列出了相关考核指标。
The Ministry of Science and Technology's call for emergency rapid test products, are required to complete product development within one to two weeks, at the latest a month and a half to obtain clinical certificates, and listed the relevant assessment indicators.
一个咽拭子样本，放入一台POS机大小的小型核酸检测仪中，按下启动键，半个小时后就能出检测结果。
A swabbing sample is placed in a small POS-sized nucleic acid detector and the start button is pressed to produce the test results in half an hour.
现场快速检验（POCT）又被称为“床边检测”，依赖便携式的仪器和试剂，海关防疫检测人员、基层疫情防控人员和一些社区工作者，在采样现场就能对疑似病例进行快速初筛。
The on-site rapid test (POCT), also known as bedside detection, relies on portable instruments and reagents that allow customs inspectors, grass-roots disease controllers and community workers to screen suspected cases quickly at sampling sites.
相比于实时荧光PCR（聚合酶链式反应）检测的复杂流程，POCT可以脱离实验室，也不需要穿着三级防护服的专业人员小心翼翼操作，只要按照说明书，一个经过短暂培训过的普通检验人员或护士也可以完成。
In contrast to the complex process of real-time fluorescence PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) detection, POCT can be removed from the laboratory and does not require careful handling by professionals in third-degree protective clothing, provided that a trained general examiner or nurse can follow the instructions.
整个检测流程至少可以节省3~4个小时。
The whole testing process can save at least 3-4 hours.
成功地快速初筛，将为全国上下的分级诊疗打下重要的基础。
Successful rapid screening will lay an important foundation for the classification of diagnosis and treatment throughout the country.
本次科技部征集的新型冠状病毒现场快速检测产品主要有三种，分别是核酸现场快速检测设备及试剂、抗原快速检测试剂和抗体快速检测试剂。
There are three kinds of rapid detection products for coronavirus collected by the Ministry of Science and Technology, namely rapid detection equipment and reagent, antigen rapid detection reagent and antibody rapid detection reagent.
一位专门从事核酸检测的国家重点实验室研究员告诉《中国新闻周刊》，核酸现场快速检测和实时PCR的技术原理是相同的，也就是基因扩增，先将新冠病毒的一段RNA片段逆转录成双链DNA，再通过DNA聚合酶进行扩增，将携带病毒的基因片段不断放大，然后通过一种荧光探针来捕捉，当扩增后的病毒浓度达到一个临界值时，就会产生荧光信号，意味着样本中被检测出携带新冠病毒。
A key national laboratory researcher specializing in nucleic acid testing told China News Weekly that rapid detection of nucleic acid sites and real-time PCR are based on the same principle of rapid DNA field detection and real-time PCR. Gene amplification begins by retrofitting a section of RNA fragment to double-stranded DNA, amplifying DNA polymerase to amplify viral fragments and then trapping them with a fluorescent probe.
前述研究员指出，和实验室内的传统PCR检测相比，一体化现场快速检测虽然便携、操作简单，但如果过于强调其“快速”的特性，其敏感度可能会受影响。
The researchers noted that while integrated on-site rapid detection is easier to carry and operate than traditional PCR testing in the laboratory, its sensitivity may be affected if its "fast" nature is overemphasized.
例如，在本次《指南》列出的核酸快速检测产品考核指标中，规定与传统实时荧光PCR试剂相比，检出率（灵敏度）要不低于95%。
For example, in the RNA rapid test product evaluation indicators listed in this Guide, the detection rate (sensitivity) is no less than 95 per cent compared to traditional real-time fluorescent PCR reagents.
“这相当于，人为的降低了对它灵敏度的要求，理论上，核酸快速检测应该和实时荧光PCR的灵敏度相同。
"This amounts to an artificial lowering of the sensitivity requirement and, in theory, rapid nucleic acid detection should be as sensitive as real-time fluorescent PCR.
”该研究员说。
"said the researcher.
另外，核酸现场快速检测一次能检测的样本量很有限，少的可能7~8份，多的也就十几份。
In addition, the nucleic acid field rapid detection once can detect the sample size is very limited, few may be 7-8, more than a dozen.
而在实验室中使用的PCR仪，一般每次可以检测96个样本，多的可以达到384份。
PCR instruments used in the laboratory can generally test 96 samples at a time, with up to 384 samples.
与核酸现场快速检测不同，抗原快速检测试剂和抗体快速检测试剂都属于免疫检测，通过采集患者的血清，利用病毒抗原和抗体相结合的原理。
Unlike rapid detection of nucleic acids in situ, antigen rapid detection reagents and antibody rapid detection reagents are immune tests that combine viral antigens with antibodies by collecting patients' serums.
抗体检测是用抗体检测出病人体内是否有病毒的抗原。
Antibody detection is to detect the presence of virus antigen in patients with antibodies.
抗原检测是用病毒抗原来检测病人体内是否激发了特异性的抗体。
Antigen detection uses viral antigen to detect whether the patient's body excites specific antibodies.
一位疾控系统专门研究核酸检测的专家对《中国新闻周刊》指出，免疫检测比核酸检测要快，前者通常只需15~30分钟即可出结果，但灵敏度不如核酸检测。
An expert specializing in nucleic acid testing for disease control systems told China News Weekly that immunological testing is faster than nucleic acid testing, which usually takes only 15-30 minutes to produce results, but is less sensitive than nucleic acid testing.
比如，《指南》的考核标准中就写明，对抗原快速检测试剂的要求是，检出率可达到核酸检测的80%以上。
For example, the evaluation criteria of the Guide state that rapid antigen detection reagents require detection rates of more than 80 per cent of nucleic acid tests.
相当于核酸检测可以检测出100个阳性样本，抗原检测只要求检出80个。
The equivalent of nucleic acid testing can detect 100 positive samples, and antigen detection requires only 80.
“实际上，这个目标也并不容易实现，”这位专家感慨道。
"In fact, that's not an easy goal to achieve," the expert lamented.
前述研究员也称，在技术层面上，同样是对病毒基因片段的扩增，核酸可以放大到100万倍以上，远远大于免疫的放大效果。
At the technical level, the same amplification of viral gene fragments can magnify nucleic acids by more than one million times, far more than immune amplification, the researchers said.
这意味着，免疫检测虽快，但对低浓度病毒的样本检出率低，易造成漏检。
This means that, although immune detection is fast, the detection rate of low-concentration virus samples is low, and easy to cause missed detection.
另外，和实时荧光PCR相比，抗原检测的特异性较差，会造成假阳性的情况。
In addition, antigen detection is less specific than real-time fluorescence PCR, which results in false positives.
此前，浙江一家医疗器械企业采用“胶体金法”，研发出一种可快速筛查冠状病毒的检测试纸，可十分钟出结果。
Before that, a Zhejiang medical device enterprise uses "colloidal gold method", developed a kind of test paper which can quickly screen coronavirus, can produce the result in 10 minutes.
该产品的研发人员就指出，这种试纸是针对冠状病毒的广谱性初筛，并不只是针对新冠病毒。
The product's researchers pointed out that the paper is aimed at the coronavirus broad-spectrum screening, not just for the new crown virus.
“任何针对基因片段的检测都是最直接的，而免疫的检测是间接的，”前述专家说。
"Any detection of a gene fragment is the most straightforward, and immune testing is indirect," said the previous expert.
多位专家告诉《中国新闻周刊》，无论是现场快速检测还是实验室内需要配合仪器的实时PCR检测，在现有技术条件下，时间的缩短一般都要在一定程度上牺牲灵敏度。
Experts have told China News Weekly that rapid on-site testing or real-time PCR testing in the lab with instrumentation generally requires a degree of sensitivity to reduce time under the current technology.
也就是说，更容易出现假阴性的情况。
This means that false negatives are more likely to occur.
近日，山东、上海、天津等省市的一些医疗器械企业，相继推出可在半小时内检出的新型冠状病毒检测试剂盒。
Recently, some medical device enterprises in Shandong, Shanghai and Tianjin have launched a new coronavirus detection kit, which can be detected in half an hour.
据了解，相关试剂盒已进入国家药监局的应急审批通道。
It is understood that the relevant kits have entered the National Drug Administration's emergency examination and approval channels.
前述专门从事核酸检测的国家重点实验室研究员告诉《中国新闻周刊》，目前，实时荧光PCR检测最快需要1~1.5小时。
The National Key Laboratory researcher specializing in nucleic acid testing told China News Weekly that real-time fluorescence PCR testing takes 1-1. 5 hours at the earliest.
因为，提取核酸的时间最快也要30~40分钟，扩增至少要40~60分钟。
Because, the fastest time to extract nucleic acids is 30-40 minutes, amplification at least 40-60 minutes.
另一位试剂盒生产企业的技术专家也对《中国新闻周刊》坦言，宣称30分钟，甚至是15分钟内可以实现快速检测的试剂，大多是牺牲了部分性能来换取速度的提升。
Another technologist at a kit maker confesses to China News that reagents that can be tested quickly within 30 minutes, or even 15 minutes, are mostly sacrificing some of their performance for speed gains.
前述疾控专家指出，对分子基因诊断技术而言，特异性和灵敏性永远需要去平衡。
The aforementioned disease control experts point out that specificity and agility always need to be balanced against molecular genetic diagnosis techniques.
特异性强，灵敏度就相对差一些；灵敏度好，特异性就会被削弱。
When specificity is strong, the sensitivity is relatively poor; when sensitivity is good, specificity is weakened.
不同的靶位、引物和探针的选取，甚至反应体系的设计都是为了更好的平衡这两种特性。
The selection of targets, primers and probes, and even the design of reaction systems are designed to better balance these two characteristics.
在他看来，从技术的角度来说，在灵敏度和特异性的平衡上，相较一些快速检测办法，目前平衡的最好的仍是实时荧光PCR检测试剂盒。
In his view, from a technical point of view, the best balance in terms of sensitivity and specificity over some rapid detection methods was still the real-time fluorescent PCR test kit.
从过往的重大疫情来看，无论是西非埃博拉病毒、甲流还是中东呼吸综合征（MERS），荧光定量PCR仍是国家首推的检测方式。
Given past major outbreaks, whether West African Ebola, swine flu, or the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), fluorescent quantitative PCR is still the country's preferred method of detection.
中国疾控中心主任高福指出，目前只有核酸试剂应用于新型冠状病毒感染病例的诊断，抗体检测试剂的研发时间比核酸检测试剂周期要长。
Gao Fufu, director of the China CDC, points out that only nucleic acid reagents have been used in the diagnosis of new coronavirus infections. Antibody detection reagents take longer to develop than nucleic acid detection reagents.
目前，已经有多家抗体检测研究机构接近临床试验完成阶段。
At present, there are many antibody detection and research institutions near the completion stage of clinical trials.
但他强调，要加快验证抗体检测试剂盒能否在发病早期检测到免疫球蛋白M抗体。
But he stressed the need to speed up verification of antibody detection kit in the early detection of immunoglobulin M antibody.
北京大学第一医院呼吸和危重症医学科主任王广发也表示，如果发现快速检测在临床上的结果和预料中有一定差距，就要分析在什么情况下更适合使用快速检测，什么时候需要再做实时PCR进行验证。
Wang Guangfa, director of respiratory and critical medicine at Peking University Hospital No. 1, also said that if rapid tests were found to be clinically inconsistent with expectations, it would be necessary to analyse when rapid tests were more appropriate and when real-time PCR testing was needed.
这样会有一个非常好的效应是，可以大大减少送检实验室的压力，实验室的压力会大幅度减轻。
This would have the very good effect of greatly reducing the pressure on the laboratory and the pressure on the laboratory.
“未来，几种类型试剂结合，取长补短，一定会进一步提高新型冠状病毒肺炎病例的检出率。
"In the future, the combination of several types of reagents to complement each other will further improve the detection rate of the new coronavirus pneumonia.
”高福说。
