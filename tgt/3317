””3月11日凌晨4点左右，潜江市新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情防控指挥部发布了“26号通告”，表示潜江市将全面恢复正常生产生活秩序，市域内所有交通卡口将解除，所有公共交通将恢复，所有企业将全面复工复产。
"March 11 around 4 a.m., the city's new-style coronavirus pneumonia command issued" Circular No. 26, "said the city will be fully normal production and life order, the city will be all traffic gates will be lifted, all public transport will be restored, and all enterprises will be fully reinstated.
该信息一出，意味着小龙虾来了。
This information means crayfish is coming.
国家农业农村部发布的《小龙虾产业发展报告（2019）》显示，2019年中国小龙虾总产量达163.87万吨，其中湖北产量就有81.24万吨。
According to the Lobster Industry Development Report (2019) issued by the State Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the total output of crayfish in China in 2019 reached 1,638,700 tons, of which 812,400 tons were produced in Hubei Province.
而湖北的小龙虾多数来自潜江。
Most of the crayfish in Hubei come from submerged rivers.
这里的小龙虾产业养活了超过十万人，占到当地劳动人口的一半以上。
The crayfish industry feeds more than 100,000 people, more than half of the local working population.
不过，3月11日上午11点，潜江官方宣布该通告无效。
However, at 11 a.m. on March 11, Qianjiang officials declared the announcement null and void.
不过，湖北潜江的小龙虾早在这个通告发布之前，就已经“复工”了。
But the crayfish in the Hubei submerged river had been "back to work" long before the announcement.
虽然为防控疫情，潜江市至今仍只对运输医疗救援物资、群众生活生产物资、保障城市运行物资等的应急车辆批发道路通行证。
Although for the prevention and control of the epidemic, the city has so far only issued road passes for emergency vehicles transporting medical and rescue materials, mass living and production materials, and ensuring the running materials of cities.
但这并不意味着没有小龙虾能被运出潜江。
But that doesn't mean no crayfish can be taken out of the river.
事实上，早在2月11日，潜江新冠肺炎疫情防控指挥部就以红头文件形式，要求全市有序开展企业复工和春耕生产。
In fact, as early as February 11, the new crown pneumonia command in the form of a red paper, the whole city to order the resumption of business and spring farming.
2月25日，湖北省潜江市潜网小龙虾交易中心部分复工，帮助农户拖运龙虾发往全国各地。
On February 25, the submersible crayfish trading center in Qianjiang City, Hubei Province, resumed work to help farmers haul lobster across the country.
复工期间，交易中心关闭了线下交易市场，采用线上收集信息，并组织了专门的收虾的队伍，定点进行收货，收货人员出入时都会经过严格的检验和消毒。
During the resumption of work, the trading centre closed the offline trading market, used online information collection and organized specialized shrimp harvesting teams to pick up goods at designated points, which were subject to strict inspection and disinfection upon arrival and departure.
“交易中心设有发往全国各地的物流，而各个养殖户联系外地客户后，可以通过这些物流发往全国各地的水产市场、餐饮店、酒店。
"The trading centers have logistics sent to all parts of the country, and through these logistics, farmers can send them to aquaculture markets, restaurants and hotels all over the country.
”潜江的小龙虾养殖户张淅对界面新闻说。
"The small lobster farmers in the submerged river Zhang Xie told the Interface News.
她淘宝店页面最显眼的位置写着，“世界小龙虾看中国，中国小龙虾看湖北，湖北小龙虾看潜江。
"The world lobster looks at China, the Chinese crayfish looks at Hubei, the Hubei crayfish looks at the diving river.
”目前，潜网小龙虾交易中心已经对外输送了大量的小龙虾。
The Submersible Lobster Trading Center has been stocking up with crayfish.
据《楚天都市报》报道，惊蛰前后，潜江小龙虾销量连续突破10万斤关口。
Before and after stinging, sales of crayfish in the submerged river passed the 100,000 catty mark in succession, the Chu Tian Metropolis Daily reported.
仅3月7日一天，发往上海、江苏、浙江、贵州等十余个省市的水产品就达16吨。
On March 7 alone, 16 tons of aquatic products were sent to more than a dozen provinces, including Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Guizhou.
如今，除湖北省外的其他地方，基本都能吃到来自潜江的小龙虾。
Today, crayfish from the submerged river are eaten almost everywhere except in Hubei province.
但张淅还按兵不动，想等待旺季的到来。
But Zhang still stood still and waited for the peak season to come.
小龙虾养殖户一般在冬天养虾，在每年3、4月卖虾苗和早季小龙虾，而到4月中旬，小龙虾最肥美的时候，开启一年的销售高峰。
Lobster farmers generally raise shrimp in winter, sell shrimp and early-season crayfish in March and April of each year, and start a year-long sales peak in mid-April, when crayfish are at their fattest.
自2016年至今，张淅一直经营着自家1200亩的小龙虾清水养殖场。
Since 2016, Zhang has been in charge of his own 1200-acre lobster water farm.
往年，她在这个时节每天可以发500斤小龙虾，到5月的最高峰，每天可以发往全国各地7000斤左右。
In previous years, she would be able to give out 500 kilos of crayfish a day at this time of the year, reaching its highest peak in May, and around 7,000 pounds a day throughout the country.
但今年，她也无奈地表示，旺季可能要推迟了。
But this year, she also reluctantly said that the peak season may be postponed.
如今通过交易中心销售的属于早虾，虽然疫情耽误了这批小龙虾的销售，但小龙虾们还没有长到最壮的时候，因此对养殖户的影响不会特别大。
Premature shrimp are now sold through trading centers, and while the outbreak has delayed the sale of the crayfish, the crayfish haven't yet reached their peak, so the impact on farmers will not be particularly severe.
然而，张淅也预测，受疫情影响，今年旺季的小龙虾可能会变便宜。
However, Zhang also predicted that the lobster season could get cheaper due to the outbreak.
“这次疫情差不多要持续到4月，疫情过后1个月左右消费者是不敢像往年一样去大规模消费的，但4月中旬到5月底却是小龙虾供应最多的时候。
"The epidemic is going on almost until April, and about a month after the epidemic, consumers are not going to consume as much as they used to, but the crayfish supply was at its peak between mid-April and the end of May.
”张淅解释道。
"There is a sprig.
小龙虾一般分大号、中号和小号，分别可用于制作蒸虾、油焖大虾，以及虾球。
Lobster is divided into large, medium and small size, respectively, can be used to make steamed shrimp, braised prawns, and shrimp balls.
在去年，它们的价格在10-35元/斤间浮动，但今年，张淅认为也许这个单价会下降5-10元。
Their prices fluctuated between 10 and 35 yuan last year, but this year Zhang felt there might be a 5-10 drop in the unit price.
虽然这对于消费者来说是一个利好消息，但对于养殖户来说，可能意味着更激烈的竞争。
While this is good news for consumers, it could mean more competition for farmers.
“我们现在只期盼全面复工复产，希望疫情早点过去恢复正常的生产生活秩序，也相信今年的小龙虾旺季不会缺席”。
"We are only looking forward to the full resumption of production, hope that the epidemic will be normal production and life order, and believe this year's crayfish season will not be absent.
