相比之前，大家终于还是有点意识到严重了。
Compared with the previous, we are still a little bit aware of the serious.
我的西班牙同事在群聊里表示担忧——他知道之前武汉的情况，封城时数字几千，没过多久就单日新增破万，他担心我们现在也已经有很多的潜在感染者了。
My Spanish colleague expressed concern in a group chat - he knew of the situation in Wuhan before him, where thousands of people had been sealed off and soon added tens of thousands a day, and he feared that we now had a lot of potential infections.
口述 | 王女士整理 |阿　布我是上海人，在西班牙马德里工作生活已有十多年了。
A: I am from Shanghai. I have worked and lived in Madrid, Spain, for over a decade.
今年年初我回国探亲，春运前返回了马德里。
I returned to Madrid earlier this year before the Spring Festival.
没过多久，就听说新冠疫情在中国暴发，当时还有点庆幸走得早，不然遇上封城封航就麻烦了。
It wasn't long before I heard that the outbreak of the new crown epidemic in China was a bit lucky to have left early, or it would have been a problem to seal the ship.
没想到短短2个月过后，中国的疫情已经得到很好的控制，而西班牙的疫情却刚刚开始暴发……1月31日，西班牙出现第一例病患——是在戈梅拉岛（LA GOMERA）度假的德国游客，之后确诊的二三例，也是来岛上度假的外国游客——分别是马约卡岛的英国游客和加那利群岛的意大利游客。
Not surprisingly, just two months later, China's epidemic is well under control, while the Spanish epidemic is just beginning to erupt... On January 31, Spain's first case - a German tourist vacationing on La Gomera - was confirmed, along with two or three foreign tourists - British tourists from Mayoka and Italian tourists from the Canary Islands.
直到2月24日，西班牙加泰罗尼亚大区才出现第一例本土病例，也是曾经去过意大利的。
It was not until 24 February that the first indigenous case occurred in the Catalonia region of Spain, which had also been to Italy.
所以当时西班牙本土居民都感觉病毒离自己还远，没想到一到3月，确诊数字像滚雪球一样，从10到99只花了几天，从99到999也只有短短几天工夫——我有几天没去看数据，再看到的时候就吃了一惊，怎么那么快！截至3月11日中午，西班牙确诊人数已经达到2083人，其中马德里有1024人，变成了一个疫区。
In March, the number of confirmed cases snowballed from 10 to 99 and from 99 to 999 to just a few days -- I didn't go to the data and was surprised to see them again -- so quickly! By noon March 11, 2,083 people had been diagnosed in Spain, including 1,024 in Madrid.
不少老人院、学校、医院都已经出现了聚集性感染，据我所知西班牙公主Leonor和Sofia就读的Santa María de los Rosales学校里也有学生已经感染。
A number of homes, schools and hospitals for the elderly have become infected and, to my knowledge, there are students at the Santa María de los Rosales School, attended by Princess Leonor of Spain and Sofia.
马德里的确诊数字日渐攀升虽然马德里的数字占据了西班牙一半，但我觉得瓦伦西亚的数字更加可怕——有好几天一直维持在15人，想想也知道不是真实的数据——瓦伦西亚有几千个球迷从意大利疫区回来，一点隔离措施也没有直接回到社区，再加上3月1日开始的法雅节，人山人海，饶是这样，确诊数字只是从15上升到70，我们都不相信。
Confirmed figures are climbing in Madrid Although Madrid accounts for half of Spain's population, I think Valencia is even scarier - 15 for a few days, not to mention the fact that there are thousands of Valencia fans coming back from Italy and not directly back into the community.
法雅节是瓦伦西亚的重要节日，一游行就是好多天，政府现在终于宣布暂停了，但是从3月1日到现在也已经十多天，今年的法雅节还制作了新冠病毒造型的法雅（法雅节的标志活动就是焚烧法雅人偶，放火迎接春天），好像大家觉得这样就能把病毒“烧死”。
The festival of Faya, an important Valencia holiday that lasted for days, has been suspended for more than a decade, but this year's festival has also produced the new Crown Virus Faya (which features the burning of Faya figures and a fire to welcome the spring), as if it were supposed to "burn" the virus.
法雅节的人潮法雅节上的新冠病毒造型法雅现在法雅节是停了，但是马德里的38妇女节庆祝游行活动还是照样举行，市中心依然人山人海，没有人戴口罩。
The Faya Festival's New Crown Virus Shape Faya is now over, but Madrid's International Women's Day celebrations are still going on, with crowds in the city centre and no one wearing masks.
而据西班牙媒体3月12日消息，妇女节带头游行Podemos党平等部长Irene Montero被确诊病毒感染……马德里38妇女节游行一样持续好几天，人山人海一方面是买不到口罩，另一方面西班牙人也不喜欢戴口罩，觉得你戴口罩表示你有病，如果没病去戴口罩，他们不会觉得这是预防，只会觉得很奇怪。
Madrid's Women's Day parade continued for days without a mask, and the Spaniards did not like wearing a mask because they thought you were sick. If you didn't wear a mask, they wouldn't think it was a precaution.
所以办公场所也没有人戴口罩上班。
So no one in the office wears a mask to work.
现在正是花粉季节，老外很多人花粉过敏，所以到处都有打喷嚏的人。
It is the pollen season and many foreigners are allergic to pollen, so people sneeze everywhere.
之前我的同事发烧了还坚持上班，我跟经理提醒过后才通知他回家休息。
My co-worker had a fever and kept going to work before I told the manager to go home for a rest.
还有一位同事的住处是在马德里的韩国人社区，也成了重灾区，所以最近也请他在家上班了。
Another co-worker, who lives in the Korean community in Madrid and has become a major disaster area, has recently been asked to work from home.
马德里的输入性病例不少，包括意大利、韩国，像之前在巴塞罗那迪奥工作的店员，她和男朋友一起跟意大利回来的朋友碰面之后，就双双被感染了，店员发烧之后依然上班，店长也不上报，照常接待客人，所有的包包都摸了一遍又一遍……后来卫生部派了人去消毒。
Madrid has a high incidence of imported cases, including Italy, South Korea, where she and her boyfriend met friends back from Italy and were infected after meeting friends back from Italy. The clerk went to work with fever, the store manager did not report, and all the bags were fumigated again and again.
意大利封城但是不封航，西班牙依然对意大利张开双臂，入境也未必申报。
Italy is sealed but unsealed, Spain remains open to Italy, and entry is not always declared.
现在还有不少意大利人飞往中国，我们也有不少航班飞中国，商务舱经济舱通通爆满，所以大家都要注意提防输入性病例。
There are still a lot of Italians flying to China, we also have a lot of flights to China, business class economy class is full, so everyone should beware of imported cases.
意大利到中国的飞机要么经过俄罗斯转机，要么经过德国，我之前就看到新闻，已经有意大利入境中国的确诊病例了。
Italian planes to China are either transiting Russia or passing through Germany, as I've seen before, and there have been confirmed cases of Italian arrivals in China.
现在马德里的华人区饭店大部分都关门了，但是不少意大利餐厅还开着，而且生意火爆，我经过那边的时候，旁边商店的老板娘就提醒我不要去，说那里很多意大利人去，当心点。
Most of the Chinese restaurants in Madrid are now closed, but many Italian restaurants are still open and business is booming. As I pass by, the landlady in the shop next door reminds me not to go there.
现在马德里的中国人都还比较警惕的，有些中国人开的商店已经拉起塑料布帘，起码有一点遮挡的作用。
Now the Chinese in Madrid are wary, some Chinese shops have pulled up plastic curtains, at least a little shielding effect.
但是大部分老外真的有点不当回事，他们觉得新冠肺炎就跟重感冒差不多吧。
But most foreigners are not serious. They think the new crown pneumonia is like a bad cold.
不过数字涨得这么快，相比之前，大家终于还是有点意识到严重了。
But the numbers are rising so fast that everyone is finally a little aware of the severity of the problem.
我的西班牙同事在群聊里表示担忧——他知道之前武汉的情况，封城时数字几千，没过多久就单日新增破万，他担心我们现在也已经有很多的潜在感染者了。
My Spanish colleague expressed concern in a group chat - he knew of the situation in Wuhan before him, where thousands of people had been sealed off and soon added tens of thousands a day, and he feared that we now had a lot of potential infections.
3月11日马德里政府终于通知关闭学校，从幼儿园到大学全部关闭两周，一直到3月底。
On 11 March, the Madrid Government finally announced the closure of schools for two weeks, from kindergarten to university, until the end of March.
跟学校一起关闭的还有文化中心、歌剧院、图书馆、体育馆（电影院没关）……马德里还取消了1000人以上的活动，未来两周的西甲比赛和乙级联赛都会在没有观众的情况下进行（但是依然会和意大利球队对阵）。
The school was closed along with cultural centres, opera houses, libraries and gymnasiums... Madrid also canceled more than 1,000 people and the next two weeks of Spanish and Serie B tournaments will take place without spectators (but still against the Italian team).
据我所知现在西班牙跟意大利的直飞航班也都取消了。
As far as I know, direct flights between Spain and Italy are now cancelled.
问题是学校放假以后，家长也只好请假在家里陪小孩，白天带着小孩去公园玩，晚上就出去泡吧——我们家附近的公园和酒吧仍旧是人山人海。
The problem is that after school holidays, parents have to take time off to stay at home with their children, take their children to the park during the day and hang out in the evenings - the parks and bars near our house are still crowded.
老外在家里呆不住，一般到了七八月份他们都要出去度假的，现在这个季节主要就是泡吧，一有空，有钱没钱都会出去喝两杯。
In July and August, they usually go on vacation. Now it's mainly a bar, and whenever you have time, if you have money or no money, you will go out for two drinks.
可是这样的话，停课有什么意义呢？昨天政府终于又出了通知，提醒大家­——学校停学不是为了让你去聚会，放假的小孩不要去电影院、游乐场、饭店、秋千和其他小朋友家。
But what's the point of suspending classes? Yesterday the government sent out another notice reminding everyone that school is not closed to let you go to parties and that children on vacation should not go to the cinema, playground, restaurant, swing and other children's homes.
通知哪些能做哪些不建议做政府宣布停课的当天，超市就被抢购一空了——肉类和蔬菜消失得最快，基本上就只剩下一些水果和芹菜（当地人芹菜主要作为香料用），米、面粉、通心粉、卫生纸也差不多卖空。
On the day the government suspended classes, supermarkets were snapped up - meat and vegetables vanished the fastest, leaving mostly fruit and celery (native celery is mostly used as spice) and rice, flour, macaroni and toilet paper almost short.
不过我倒不是很担心食物，大城市很快会有补给的，而且家里附近的小商店里肉类蔬菜都还很充足，也没有涨价，只是大超市出现抢购潮。
But I'm not worried about food, big cities will soon be stocked up, and there's plenty of meat and vegetables in the small shops around the house.
空荡荡的超市水果也只剩下几个橙子最近政府也开始呼吁大家远程上班、在家办公，还呼吁服务行业戴口罩上班，说“大家可以大胆地戴口罩上班”——之前疫情刚刚暴发的时候政府说的是“我们的医疗设施很好，请大家放心，一切都在控制范围内，我们的救护车是全世界最好的，8分钟内就能到”，还让大家不用戴口罩，只需要注意多洗手，说话保持一米距离。
Only a few oranges remain in the empty supermarket. The government has recently called for telecommuting, home-based work, and for service industries to wear masks to work, saying "We have excellent medical facilities, please rest assured our ambulances are among the best in the world and can be reached in eight minutes."
结果现在救护车电话都很难打通。
As a result, ambulance calls are now difficult to reach.
西班牙和中国的关系一直不错，最近几年百货公司的外语欢迎条幅，排第一的就是中文，然后是日语。
Relations between Spain and China have been good, with department stores welcoming banners in foreign languages in recent years, with Chinese at the top and Japanese at the top.
中国疫情刚刚暴发的时候，西班牙很多商场、企业也捐赠了口罩。
When the outbreak first erupted in China, many stores and businesses in Spain donated masks.
西甲的时候皇马球员身穿“中国加油”的T恤入场，瓦伦西亚队还在比赛前为疫情中不幸去世的人默哀一分钟。
Real Madrid entered the Spanish giants wearing "refueling Chinese" T-shirts and Valencia observed a minute of silence ahead of the game for those who died in the outbreak.
皇马与“众志成城 加油中国”加油板合影现在西班牙卫生部说准备大量派发口罩了，首批41万个，有13万个会发到马德里。
Spanish health ministry says it plans to hand out a large number of face masks, with the first batch of 410,000 and 130,000 due to be sent to Madrid.
这些口罩是通过国际渠道采购的，我想里面应该也有中国制造的。
These masks were purchased through international channels and I think they are made in China as well.
疫情还带来了一些其他的问题，比如Okupa（强占空屋）——西班牙银行有大量的闲置房产，因为无人管理成为无业游民觊觎的对象，法律规定被Okupa的屋主，要在48小时内报案，而且是在对方还没来得及更换门锁的情况下，警察才可以进去将人赶走。
The epidemic also raises other issues, such as Okupa, where Spanish banks have plenty of vacant properties that are coveted by the homeless. Owners of Okupa are required by law to report cases within 48 hours, and the police can go in and evict people before the other party can change the locks.
现在这样的Okupa现象在马德里不少见，前阵子一个老太太住院半个月，回来就发现自己的房子被人Okupa了，赶也赶不走，因为已经超过48小时，后续维权很麻烦。
The Okupa phenomenon is not uncommon in Madrid, where an old woman was hospitalized for half a month and returned to find that her house had been overrun by Okupa because it had been more than 48 hours, making it difficult to defend her rights.
这真的是挺魔幻的。
This is really magic.
当地人反对Okupa的条幅征集令阳春三月，万物复苏。
Local opposition to Okupa's banners helped to revive everything in March.
