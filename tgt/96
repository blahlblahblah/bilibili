除夕夜，我跟儿子开了视频电话。
On New Year's Eve, I had a video call with my son.
他才7岁，不太懂现在外面发生了什么，为什么自己不能出去玩。
He is only 7 years old and can't understand what is going on outside and why he can't go out to play.
他喜欢玩游戏，我就告诉他，外面有很多病毒，病毒就是一种怪兽，妈妈在外面打怪兽。
He likes to play games, I told him, there are a lot of viruses outside, virus is a monster, mother beat monster outside.
然后他说，“妈妈，我要去你那里，跟你一起去打怪兽！”我说，“你又不像妈妈有防护服，有各种装备，怎么打怪兽呢？等你长大一点才行。
Then he said, "Mommy, I'm going to go with you and fight monsters with you!" I said, "You're not like your mother has protective clothing, all kinds of equipment, how to beat monsters?
”他就乖乖听话了。
'He obeyed.
口述 | 冯小萍记者 | 王珊实习记者 | 岳颖其实很惭愧，我做护士13年，之前一直都不知道武汉还有一个金银潭医院，我只知道它的另一个名字——武汉市医疗救治中心，知道它专收传染病患者。
AT RATE & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & nbsp; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & #
要是没有新型冠状病毒，我可能一辈子也不会来金银潭医院，更不会和它产生这么深的联系。
Had it not been for the new coronavirus, I would never have come to the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital, much less become so deeply connected with it.
我是在腊月二十九早上到的武汉市金银潭医院。
I arrived at Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital on the morning of the 29th of December.
前一天晚上，我下班后还没回家，突然接到了主任的通知，说包括我在内的8个护士被选中去支援金银潭医院。
I had not returned home from work the night before when I was informed by the director that eight nurses, including me, had been selected to support the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital.
我所在的医院是一家三甲医院，医护人员1000多人。
My hospital is a triple-A hospital with more than 1000 medical staff.
我们都很懵了，但心里还是生出了一些使命感。
We were stunned, but we had some sense of purpose in mind.
我想到了我的儿子，他今年才7岁，正是三观形成的时候，我希望自己能给他做一个榜样。
I think of my son, who is only 7 years old, and I hope I can set an example for him when the Three Signs come into being.
他可能不懂得我在做什么，但他明白，“妈妈在做正确的事情”。
He may not understand what I'm doing, but he knows, "Mom is doing the right thing."
作者：阁阁《我不知道你是谁？但我知道你为了谁！》我是普通外科出身的，团队的其他人分别来自外科、内科和ICU。
Author: I don't know who you are, but I know for whom! I am a general surgeon and the rest of the team are from surgery, internal medicine and ICU.
虽然都在同一所医院，因为科室不同，大家都不太认识。
Although all in the same hospital, because of different departments, we do not know much.
不过在一个团队里，大家很快就熟了起来，每个人都努力发挥所长。
But in a team, we soon got to know each other, and everyone worked hard to develop their capabilities.
有的护士生活能力特别强，就和我们分享很多生活的小技巧，比如住酒店的注意事项；还有的护士业务能力非常强，比如有个ICU的老师，和我们分享了很多重症病房的实战经验。
Some nurses have great life skills, such as tips for staying in a hotel, while others have strong professional skills, such as an ICU teacher who shares a lot of practical experience with us in intensive care units.
在来到金银潭之前，我没有想到武汉肺炎的情况已经这么严重。
Before I came to the gold and silver pool, I had no idea that the case of Wuhan pneumonia had become so serious.
因为我在外科，很少收治这方面的病人。
Because I'm in surgery, I seldom treat patients in this area.
在金银潭医院培训时，护理部主任问我们，“你们有没有在ICU工作的经验？”我听到这句话，马上觉得，情况应该比较严重——相对于普通病房的护士，ICU的护士业务能力和应急处置的能力都相对强一些。
During the training at Gold and Silver Pool Hospital, the head of Nursing asked us, "Do you have any experience working in the ICU?" When I heard this, I felt that the situation should be more serious - the nurses in ICU had better professional skills and emergency response ability than the nurses in the general wards.
护理部主任这么问，说明她要面对的情况是很恶劣的，突发情况应该非常多。
The head of the Nursing Department asked her that the situation she had to face was very difficult and that the number of emergencies should be very high.
我心里开始做一些建设。
I began to do some construction in my heart.
我被分在北7病区，在医院北边的第7层楼。
I was separated on the 7th floor, north of the hospital.
它原本是一个结核病区，但现在整个金银潭收治的都是新冠肺炎患者，所以也就没有科室之分，而是利用方位和楼层来划分病区。
It used to be a tuberculosis area, but now the entire gold and silver pool is for patients with Newly Coronary Pneumonia, so there is no division by department, but rather by location and floor.
37个病人当中，有4个上了呼吸机，2个在用高流量吸氧。
Of the 37 patients, 4 had ventilators and 2 were using high-flow oxygen.
自从我来到这，我们病区几乎每天都有大抢救和小抢救。
Since I came here, our sick area almost every day there are major rescue and small rescue.
小抢救就是用一些措施来缓解病人的呼吸症状，比如用呼吸类的药物、放高流量的氧气，或者调整呼吸机的参数，需要很多人一起协作。
Minor resuscitation is the use of a number of measures to alleviate breathing symptoms, such as breathing drugs, high-volume oxygen, or adjust the parameters of the ventilator, the need for a large number of people to work together.
大抢救的话，要插管，几乎全部的医护都要一起上了。
Great rescue, to intubation, almost all the medical care must be together.
有时候病人的病情确实超过了我们的能力范围，我们只能做一些急救措施，剩下的还是要靠病人自己，这时候就会感觉非常无力。
Sometimes the patient's condition is beyond our capacity, we can only do some first aid measures, the rest depends on the patient himself, this time will feel very weak.
甚至一天好几次，感觉这个病人也不好，那个病人也不好。
Even several times a day, the patient did not feel well, nor did the patient.
有时候我看病人的样子，他除了有些喘之外，完全就是一个正常人，但他可能突然就发病了，嘴唇憋得青紫，指甲也是一样。
Sometimes I look at a patient who is completely normal except for a few breaths, but he may suddenly become ill, his lips are blue, and his nails are all the same.
这时我就会想，完了，这个人会不会就这样走了？就离开我了？我是不是救不了他了？蔡小川 摄很多病人在抢救之后也会跟护士说，刚才喘不上气时，以为自己可能就这么死掉了。
At this point, I will think, the end, this person will not just leave me? I am not able to save him? Cai Xiaochuan many patients will also tell nurses after the rescue, just gasping for breath, thought they might have died.
我想医学还是要发展，才能更多地解决人类的痛苦。
I think medicine needs to develop to be able to deal more with human suffering.
不过到目前为止，我的病区还没有一例死亡的病例，也算一件高兴事。
But so far there has been no case of death in my area, and it is a pleasure.
金银潭收治的都是其他医院的确诊病例，这几天医院每晚都会转入几十个病人，这说明外面受感染的群体可能在不断扩大。
The gold and silver pools are filled with confirmed cases from other hospitals, which have been turning in dozens of patients every night for a few days, suggesting that the number of infected people outside may be increasing.
我刚来的时候，我们病区有24个病人，现在已经接近40个了。
When I first arrived, there were 24 patients in our ward, and now there are nearly 40.
这一段时间，我看到很多医院都在网上发物资紧缺的求救通知，金银潭是“灾区中的灾区”，收治的病人最重、最多，所以各方支援的人也很多。
During this period, I saw many hospitals in the online material shortage of emergency notices, gold and silver pool is "the disaster areas in the disaster areas," the most patients admitted, the most, so the support of the parties is also very high.
我们虽然物资还够，但我心里一直也没底。
Although we have enough material resources, but my heart has always been bottomless.
有一次，我上楼的时候正好遇到领物资回来的老师，我看他领了很多口罩和防护服，就问他，“我们现在的物资还是挺丰富的吧？我看到我们医院在到处求救。
Once when I was going upstairs, I happened to meet the teacher who was getting supplies back. I saw him take a lot of masks and protective clothing, and I asked him, "We still have a lot of stuff, don't we?
”他回我，“这不一定，能不能支撑一个星期，真的不好说。
'he returned to me.' It's not certain; it won't last a week, really.
”我们都非常节省，穿防护服特别闷、特别累，哪怕穿着什么也不干，都会喘不上来气。
We were all so economical that we were so stuffy and tired in protective clothing that we couldn't catch our breath even if we didn't do anything.
我们每天工作7、8个小时，为了解决这个问题，我们四小时轮换一次，4个小时在病房里面照顾病人，4个小时在外围工作。
We work seven or eight hours a day, and to solve this problem, we rotate every four hours, taking care of patients in the ward for four hours and working on the periphery for four hours.
这样一天下来，只用一套防护服。
At the end of the day, just a suit.
蔡小川 摄昨天我穿着防护服在病房里一口气待了7个小时，出来的时候，整个人都是昏的，脑袋直发木。
Tsai Xiaochuan, I was wearing protective clothing in the ward for seven hours yesterday, come out, the whole person is faint, the head is straight wooden.
还有一个节约防护服的办法，我们进病房之前都会先上厕所，工作中基本不喝水，否则出来又要换一套防护服，这太浪费了，实在心疼。
Another way to save money on protective clothing is to go to the toilet before entering the ward. We don't drink water at work, otherwise we have to change a suit.
昨天，我们医院护理部的主任来给我们送物资，包括一些预防性的药物。
Yesterday, the director of the nursing department of our hospital came to deliver us supplies, including some preventive medicine.
这些药物也是院长自己通过某些渠道找来的，就这么一点，都给我们送来了。
These drugs were also found by the dean himself through some channels, and that's all that was sent to us.
主任说，“你们在第一线，接触的都是重症病人，一定要保护好自己。
"You are in the front line, you are in contact with serious patients, we must protect themselves.
”我听了心里特别难受。
"I felt terrible at hearing it.
虽然大家都替我们自豪，说我们冲锋陷阵，但我觉得受之有愧。
Although everyone was proud of us and said we were fighting, I felt guilty.
我们因为在前线，防护也是最好的，反观我们后方的同事，他们虽然没有接触这么多病人，但医院里也有疑似患者，我有好多同事都倒下了。
We had the best protection because we were on the front line, but my colleagues back home, who had no contact with so many patients, also had suspected patients in the hospital and many of my colleagues were down.
有时候他们给我打电话，我听到他们喘气的声音，跟我的病人一样，呼哧呼哧的，我猜测他们可能也得了这种肺炎，但谁也不提这个事情。
Sometimes they call me, and I hear them pant, like my patients, wheezing, and I guess they might have it too, but no one talks about it.
他们没有试剂盒，不能确诊，只能自己隔离用药。
They did not have test kits, could not be diagnosed, had to isolate their own medication.
蔡小川 摄我们医院连N95口罩都很少，现在一个科室才几十个。
Cai Xiaochuan our hospital even N95 masks are few, now a department only dozens.
今天主任来送物资的时候，我们支援团队有个护士说，“主任，我这里有两个N95口罩，你带回去好不好？”我当时差点就哭出来，“两个口罩拿回去能干吗呢？”前几天总理来看望我们，走之前说，“今晚一定要把物资给你们送过来！”这真的让我看到了光，我心想，总理都发话了，看你们谁还敢不给我们东西？有一个护士激动得不行，眼泪都流进了自己的口罩。
Today, when the director came to deliver the supplies, one of our support staff said, "Director, I have two N95 masks here, will you take them back?" I almost cried out, "What can I do with the two masks?"
这两天，我觉得病人病情有在好转。
I think the patient is getting better these two days.
这让我们就觉得有了希望。
That gives us hope.
有一个病人，刚入院时，他反复发烧，呼吸衰竭很严重，还经历过两次抢救。
One patient, who had been admitted to the hospital with recurrent fever, severe respiratory failure, and had been resuscitated twice.
他比较年轻，只有30多岁，入院几天还不见好，情绪很低落，也不怎么说话。
He was younger, in his 30s, had not been hospitalized for several days, was in a low mood and did not speak much.
后来治疗慢慢有了效果，我能感觉到，他的心理状态在慢慢变好。
Later the treatment slowly took effect, and I could feel that his mental state was slowly improving.
原来我给他用药的时候，他只是答应一声，现在就会主动和我聊天，“护士，现在几点了啊？”“你们今天什么班啊？”“今天初几啊？你们怎么还没回家过年？真的辛苦你们啦。
When I gave him medicine, he just promised to talk to me now, "Nurse, what time is it?" "What class are you on today?" "What's the beginning of the day? Why haven't you been home for the New Year? It's really hard for you.
”远征 摄隔离病房不允许有陪护家属，所以病人全部的治疗和护理都是我们完成的。
"Expeditionary photography is not allowed to have accompanying family members, so we do all the treatment and care.
病人和我们关系都很好，也很配合，他们也知道我们很辛苦，经常嘱咐我们注意休息。
The patients are on good terms with us, they also know we are very hard, often ask us to pay attention to rest.
有些轻症的患者，除了打针之外，基本不需要护士护理，生活质量是比较高的，有时还会主动过来给我们帮忙，比如推推治疗车。
Some light cases, in addition to injection, do not need nursing care, the quality of life is relatively high, and sometimes offer to help us, such as pushing the treatment car.
我印象最深刻的病人是一个老爷子。
My most impressive patient is an old man.
他身体状态不是很好，走路颤颤巍巍的，大小便不能自理。
He was not in very good health, he walked trembling, and he was unable to relieve himself.
昨天，趁我们不在，他想自己下床去上厕所。
Yesterday, while we were away, he wanted to get out of bed and go to the bathroom himself.
隔壁床有一个40多岁的大哥，状况并不好，自己也是需要天天吸氧的，看到他这样，就赶紧搀着他去了。
Next door bed has a 40-year-old elder brother, the condition is not good, their own daily need to absorb oxygen, see him so, hurried to help him go.
我们看到这一幕特别感动，但是还是善意地批评了一下老爷子，让他再想去厕所一定和我们说。
We were particularly moved to see this, but we kindly criticized the man for wanting to go to the bathroom again.
他说，“你们太辛苦了，每天跑来跑去的，我真的不想麻烦你们。
"You're working so hard, running around every day, and I really don't want to bother you," he said.
”他当时因为去厕所，已经喘不上气了，张着嘴大口的呼吸，就这一句话，他用了大概一分钟。
"He was gasping for breath from going to the toilet, and it took him about a minute to breathe with his mouth open.
“我还是做得不够啊，才让他这么辛苦。
"I didn't do it enough to make him work so hard.
”我直接就哭出来了。
'I cried directly.
除夕夜，我跟儿子开了视频电话。
On New Year's Eve, I had a video call with my son.
他才7岁，不太懂现在外面发生了什么，为什么自己不能出去玩。
He is only 7 years old and can't understand what is going on outside and why he can't go out to play.
