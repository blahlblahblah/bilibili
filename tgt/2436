一个多月过去了，李名刚从没后悔过自己在武汉“封城”那天的“逆行”决定。
More than a month has passed, Li Minggang never regretted his "closure" day in Wuhan "retrograde" decision.
李名刚是武汉一家便利店的店长。
Li Minggang is the head of a convenience store in Wuhan.
1月23日凌晨两点半左右，他在湖北鄂州老家被一岁半小儿子的哭声惊醒，拿起手机刷微博，看到了武汉即将从上午10点开始“封城”的消息。
At about 2: 30 a.m. on January 23, he was woken up by the cries of his one-and-a-half-year-old son, picked up his mobile phone, and saw the news that Wuhan would be "closed" from 10 a.m.
他瞬间清醒过来，意识到：武汉的疫情严重程度超出了他的想象。
He woke up in a moment and realized that Wuhan was more serious than he thought.
李名刚在手机上看到，自当日10时起，武汉全市公交、地铁、轮渡、长途客运暂停运营；机场、火车站离汉通道暂时关闭。
Li Ming just saw on his mobile phone that since 10: 00 on the same day, Wuhan city bus, subway, ferry, long-distance passenger transport operation suspended; airports, railway stations from Han corridor temporarily closed.
33岁的他从未见过如此严格的封锁措施，他立马想到，店里的人手肯定会不够，甚至店能不能开起来，也是个问题。
The 33-year-old, who had never seen such a strict blockade, immediately thought the store would be understaffed, and even whether it could open was a problem.
想到这里，李名刚睡不着了。
Li Ming just couldn't sleep at all.
他没有吵醒在另一个房间熟睡的父母，只是跟妻子简单交代了一下家里的事情，就连夜启程，踏上了回武汉的路。
He did not wake up his parents, who were asleep in the other room. He told his wife a simple story about his family and set off on the road back to Wuhan.
“我当时真的没有犹豫，就跟我老婆商量，说我必须得回武汉。
"I really did not hesitate to discuss with my wife that I had to go back to Wuhan.
”他对《财经》记者说。
'he told Caijing.
那天清晨，鄂州通往武汉方向的高速公路上空空荡荡，除了自己和另外一辆私家车之外，李名刚基本没有看到其他车辆。
Early that morning, Huizhou Province to Wuhan direction of the highway empty, except for his own and another private car, Li Minggang barely saw other vehicles.
武汉到了，一下高速路口，前方的私家车立马调头重新上高速，朝着远离武汉的方向驶去。
Wuhan arrived, a high-speed intersection, the front of the private car immediately turned back on the high-speed, away from Wuhan direction.
这很反常，他猜想：对方一定是在路上看到了武汉即将“封城”的消息。
This is very unusual, he guessed: the other party must have seen Wuhan on the road "closure" of the news.
但他没有犹豫，按原计划返回武汉。
But he did not hesitate to return to Wuhan as planned.
李名刚的决定，让他的便利店在整个疫情期间都保持着营业状态。
Li's decision kept his convenience store open throughout the epidemic.
武汉市商务局的数据显示，武汉市共有中百罗森、Today今天、可多、慕臣、美宜佳等便利店品牌20余个，门店数量约3500家。
Wuhan city has more than 20 convenience store brands such as Zhongbao Rosens, Today, Kodo, Muchen and Meizijia, with about 3,500 stores in Wuhan city, according to Wuhan Commercial Bureau.
其中，李名刚所在的便利店截至2019年6月30日，门店数量为295家。
As of June 30, 2019, the number of stores in Li Minggang's convenience store was 295.
据《证券日报》报道，受疫情影响，李名刚所属的便利店营业门店最初锐减到20多家，而后逐渐恢复到120多家。
As a result of the epidemic, Li's convenience store opened more than 20 stores and gradually recovered to more than 120, the Securities Journal reported.
这些克服重重困难坚持营业的门店，在武汉市民出行不便、物资短缺的非常时期，和大型超市、外送平台等企业一起，为他们提供了基本的生活保障。
These stores, which persist in their business despite many difficulties, together with large supermarkets and delivery platforms, have provided basic living security for the residents of Wuhan during the difficult period of travel and shortage of materials.
钱重要还是命重要李名刚在武汉管理着四家24小时营业的便利店，其中人流量最大的一家平时一天要接待约700名顾客。
Li Ming has just managed four 24-hour convenience stores in Wuhan, with the largest number of customers receiving about 700 customers a day.
出发之前，他在微信上简单地问了问当班店员的心理状况，以及店里有没有顾客集中采购物资的情况。
Before setting out, he briefly asked the shop assistants on duty about their psychological state and whether there was any centralized purchasing.
回市区的路上，他看到不少人在路边焦急地等车，大批交警正在向高速路口集中，似乎是要赶去设置路障。
On his way back to the city, he saw people waiting anxiously by the side of the road. Traffic police were converging on the motorway, apparently to set up roadblocks.
李名刚是在1月21日离开武汉回鄂州参加亲戚的婚礼的，按原计划，他会在老家过完新年再返回武汉工作。
Li Minggang left Wuhan on January 21 to attend a relative's wedding in Huizhou, where he had planned to spend the New Year's holiday in his hometown before returning to Wuhan.
离开的时候，武汉城表面看起来还一片平静，紧邻武汉的鄂州也没有意识到危险即将来临，亲戚的婚礼甚至还如期举行，他回想起来还有些后怕。
At the time of his departure, Wuhan city still looked calm on the surface, Huizhou, the immediate vicinity of Wuhan, did not realize the danger was imminent, relatives' wedding even held as scheduled, he thought back a little afraid.
所幸，参加过那场喜宴的亲戚们，至今无人感染新冠病毒。
Thankfully, none of the relatives who attended the feast have been infected with the new crown virus.
得知他回到武汉的消息后，有要好的朋友问他：你是不是傻，命重要还是钱重要？“当然命重要！这已不是命与钱问题，如果都把命放在首位而退缩，是不是整个城都要瘫痪了？”1月25日大年初一，他在自己的朋友圈里这么说道。
After learning that he had returned to Wuhan, a close friend asked him, "Are you stupid, your life important or your money important?" "Of course life matters! It's not a matter of life and money.
刚回武汉的时候，他的人手只够维持一家店的运营，但他想把第二家店也开起来，唯一的办法是把尚在老家的妻子接来。
When he first returned to Wuhan, he had enough manpower to support only one shop, but he wanted to open a second one, and the only way to do so was to pick up his wife, who was back home.
李名刚的老家在武汉与鄂州的交界处，当时鄂州也已经“封城”，人员不能随意进出，村里跟他们说，一旦出去了，就不能再回来了。
Li Minggang's hometown in Wuhan and Huizhou at the junction of Huizhou, when Huizhou has also been "closed," people can not enter and leave freely, the village told them that once out, can not come back.
家里还有两个孩子需要照顾，他犹豫了很久，最终还是决定把孩子们交给父母，让妻子来店里帮忙。
With two children to look after, he hesitated for a long time and finally decided to give the children to his parents and his wife to help them.
那天他开车到武汉与鄂州的交界处，让妻子从村里走出来，接上她回武汉，另一家门店才得以开始运转。
That day he drove to Wuhan and Huizhou, let his wife walk out of the village, then back to Wuhan, another shop was able to start operation.
“多亏了我老婆。
"Thanks to my wife.
”他说。
'he said.
一个月来，武汉市内的封锁不断升级。
For a month, the blockade in Wuhan has escalated.
李名刚和妻子所租住的小区一度禁止他们外出，态度非常强硬，好在经过公司和政府部门帮助，他们顺利拿到了出入许可。
Li Minggang and his wife rented a community that once prohibited them from going out, a very tough attitude, but through the company and government help, they were able to get access permits.
能服务到顾客就够了大年三十（1月24日），李名刚是在店里守夜度过的。
It was enough to reach the customers. Li Minggang spent the night at the store.
目前，武汉城内几乎已经看不到24小时营业的便利店，他的两家门店，营业时间也缩短到了早上8：30到晚上10点左右。
Hanwuhan has seen almost no 24-hour convenience stores, and his two stores have been cut back to around 8: 30 a.m. to 10: 00 p.m.
起初还有少数顾客不戴口罩来购物，现在几乎都是全副武装，甚至有一些戴着很夸张的防毒面具。
At first there were a few customers who didn't wear masks, and now they're almost all heavily armed, and some even wear exaggerated gas masks.
店员们营业的时候也会戴上口罩和一次性手套，随时用消毒液消毒。
Shop assistants also wear masks and disposable gloves when they are open and disinfect themselves with disinfectant at all times.
“感觉人与人之间的距离比平时远一些。
"I feel the distance between people is a little bit farther than usual.
”李名刚说。
"said Li Minggang.
有的顾客不愿意踏进门店一步，告诉店员自己要什么，让店员帮忙取。
Some customers don't want to step into a store and tell the shop assistant what they want.
有的甚至准备了一张字条，上面写着需要采购的东西，直接丢给店员让他看着拿，全程不说一句话，付了钱就走，生怕跟店员有过多的接触。
Some even prepared a note that said what they wanted to buy. They threw it directly at the clerk and asked him to take it. Without saying a word, they paid for it, fearing that they would have too much contact with the clerk.
2月10日，武汉宣布所有社区进行封闭式管理，每3天每户可有一名住户外出采购。
On 10 February, Wuhan announced that all communities would be under closed management, with one household going shopping every three days.
普通人难出门，到了晚上九十点钟，倒是附近值班的城管下了班，会来店里买些火锅底料，买点酒，聚个餐放松一下紧张的情绪。
Ordinary people are difficult to go out, but at 9: 00 pm, but the nearby watchman off the shift, will come to the shop to buy some hot pot materials, buy some wine, a dinner to relax the tense mood.
有一天晚上，已经过了午夜12点。
One night, it was after midnight.
李名刚一个人在店里清点商品，正准备关门的时候，来了一个大约40多岁、开着奔驰的中年男人，进门就问：店里有没有卫生棉？李名刚说有。
Li MingGang was counting the goods in the store and was about to close down when a middle-aged man in his mid-40s came by and asked, Do you have any tampons in the shop? Li Ming just said yes.
顾客的眼睛一下子就发光了，连连表示感谢。
The customer's eyes lit up in a flash of gratitude.
这名顾客告诉李名刚，他是为家中的妻子和女儿出门来采购卫生棉的，家里的存货用完了，他不得不一个人开车出来买，在这之前，他已经在洪山区转了四、五公里，只有李名刚店里的灯光，还和平时一样亮着。
The customer told Li Minggang that he was out shopping for tampons for his wife and daughter. He ran out of stock and had to drive out to buy it alone. Before that, he had been walking four or five kilometers around the Hung Shan area.
“当时也是蛮有感触的，不管赚不赚钱，我觉得能服务到顾客，就够了。
"It was quite touching at the time, and whether I made money or not, I thought it would be enough to serve the customers.
”他说。
'he said.
目前李名刚管理的4家门店，其中一家尚在筹备开业，另外一家由于所在的商场关门也只能暂停营业，剩下两家在“封城”期间，从早上8：30到晚上10点，一直尽力维持着运营。
One of the four stores Li has just managed is still in the process of being opened, the other is closed because of the closure of the mall, and the remaining two are in "closed city" period, from 8: 30 am to 10: 00 pm, have been trying to maintain the operation.
特殊时期提倡无接触购物，李名刚所属的便利店也和第三方外卖平台合作，开展了外送业务。
Special period advocates no contact shopping, Li Minggang's convenience store and third-party take-out platform cooperation, launched the outsourcing business.
随着小区封闭管理的进一步加强，2月18日，武汉市大部分超市、便利店都贴出告示，不接受个人采购，只接受以社区为单位的采购。
With the further strengthening of closed community management, most supermarkets and convenience stores in Wuhan City posted notices on February 18, refusing to accept individual purchases but only community-based purchases.
众多小区开始组织团购，由社区工作人员与商店对接。
Many small areas began to organize group purchase, by community workers and the store docking.
疫情期间，他的便利店客流量减少到了平时的三分之一甚至更低，除了一家店因为临近住宅区，线上订单较多，客单价高，尚能盈利，其他三家都因为没开店或者没客流，处于亏损状态。
Convenience-store traffic fell to one-third or less during the epidemic, except for one that was profitable because of its proximity to residential areas, more online orders, higher unit prices, and three others that were losing money because they had no stores or no customers.
为了满足居民买菜的需求，在公司的组织下，李名刚的门店也开始出售鸡蛋、蔬菜等原本没有的商品，商品种类虽然不如疫情发生前齐全，但基本能维持供应。
In order to meet the needs of residents to buy vegetables, under the company's organization, Li Minggang stores began to sell eggs, vegetables and other original goods, although the variety of commodities, although not as complete as before the outbreak of the epidemic, but basically maintain the supply.
“省内的供应商还好一些，主要是省外的供应商因为货车限行，送货进来难度比较大。
"The province's suppliers are better, mainly outside the province because of the restrictions on goods vehicles, delivery in more difficult.
”他说。
'he said.
开店之余，李名刚还在公司做志愿者。
Besides opening a shop, Li Minggang is still a volunteer in the company.
他所在的便利店与武汉的一家食品企业合作，为武汉的一些定点医院提供餐食，一开始运输车辆比较紧张，像李名刚这样的员工就赶来帮忙。
The convenience store, which works with a food company in Wuhan, provided meals at some of Wuhan's designated hospitals. At first, employees like Li Minggang came to help, as transport vehicles were tight.
每天早上10点，李名刚要开车赶到离门店40公里外的工厂，拿上牛奶、酸奶以及一些鲜食产品，送往武汉大学中南医院、武汉市第三医院等定点医院，最远的一趟，来回一共跑了100多公里，开的都是自己的私家车，没有任何补贴。
Every morning at 10: 00 a.m., Li Ming just drove to the factory 40 kilometers away from the store, took milk, yoghurt and some fresh food products to Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan City Hospital and other designated hospitals, the furthest back and forth more than 100 kilometers, driving their own private cars without any subsidies.
李名刚记得，有一次给武汉市第三医院送货的时候，一位负责对接物资的工作人员接到米饭、面包和饭团，笑得特别开心。
Li Meng just remembered one time to Wuhan Third Hospital delivery, a staff member in charge of docking materials received rice, bread and rice balls, laughed particularly happy.
“他们冒着这么大的风险，还能有这么好的心态。
"They could have been in such a good frame of mind at such a risk.
我们能给他们提供这些热食，为武汉这个城市做一点自己的贡献也蛮好的。
We can provide them with these hot food, Wuhan for the city to do a little bit of its own contribution is also good.
”他说。
'he said.
他不是没有考虑过回到武汉的风险，但还是回来了。
He did not consider the risk of returning to Wuhan, but returned.
“那么多医疗工作者都冲在一线，他们比我们更危险。
"So many health workers are on the frontlines, they're more dangerous than we are.
