本报记者 易妍君 广州报道为应对疫情恶化带来的经济下行压力，美联储推出了政策组合拳。
Our reporter Yi Yu-jun Guangzhou reported that the United States Federal Reserve launched a policy mix in response to the economic downturn brought about by the worsening epidemic.
美联储在美国当地时间3月15日的紧急会议上决定，降息100个基点，将联邦基金利率目标降至0.00%～0.25%，并宣布重启量化宽松政策，接下来的数月将推出7000亿美元的大规模量化宽松计划。
At an emergency meeting on March 15, the Federal Reserve decided to cut interest rates by 100 basis points, cut the federal funds rate target to 0.00% to 0.25%, and announced a resumption of quantitative easing, followed by a massive $700 billion program of quantitative easing in the coming months.
同时，美联储还将银行的紧急贷款贴现率下调了125个基点，至0.25%，并将贷款期限延长至90天。
The Fed also cut the bank's emergency lending rate by 125 basis points to 0.25% and extended the duration of the loans to 90 days.
随后，香港金管局发布公告称，因应美联储的决定，香港金融管理局（金管局）今日亦下调基本利率。
Subsequently, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced that in response to the decision of the Federal Reserve, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) also lowered its base rate today.
根据预设公式，今天基本利率设定于0.86%。
According to the default formula, today the base rate is set at 0.86 per cent.
就美股股指期货的表现来看，上述政策组合拳并未提振市场。
In terms of the performance of U. S. stock index futures, the combination of these policies did not boost the market.
3月16日，道琼斯指数期货、标普500指数期货均大幅下跌，截至《中国经营报》记者发稿，标普500期货跌4.78%，纳指期货跌4.56%，道指期货跌4.58%。
On March 16, Dow Jones and S & P 500 futures fell sharply, with S & P 500 futures down 4.78 per cent, Nano futures down 4.56 per cent and Dow futures down 4.58 per cent, according to China Business News.
受美股接连暴跌拖累，A股今天尾盘跳水。
Plunging U. S. stocks dragged down, A shares diving late today.
市场预期今天晚上美股还会大跌，出现恐慌性抛售。
Markets are expecting another sharp drop in U. S. stocks tonight, with panic selling.
南方基金方面在接受《中国经营报》记者采访时表示，在疫情影响没有好转迹象的情况下，美联储本次紧急临时降息对于未来的市场流动性造成了不良预期，进一步降低市场的风险偏好。
In an interview with China Business Daily, the South Fund said the emergency temporary rate cut by the Federal Reserve created bad expectations for future market liquidity and further reduced market risk appetite in the absence of signs that the epidemic was improving.
风险资产价格短期内或波动较大。
Venture asset prices can be volatile in the short term.
权益市场上，房地产、基建等受益于积极货币政策和财政政策的逆周期板块可能跑赢大盘。
In equity markets, countercyclical sectors such as real estate and infrastructure, which benefit from active monetary and fiscal policies, are likely to win.
中信证券研究报告指出，对比两次大危机，金融危机的前兆或已出现，按照“情绪危机-金融危机-经济危机”的传导链，目前美国市场可能介于第一和第二阶段之间。
The Citic Securities study points out that, in contrast to the two big crises, the harbingers of a financial crisis may have emerged, with the US market now likely to be somewhere between the first and second phases, according to the "emotional crisis-financial crisis-economic crisis" transmission chain.
如果能尽快控制疫情，全球货币政策加强协调，避免流动性和资产价格相互恶化，或许就能够避免危机的发生。
If the epidemic can be brought under control soon, global monetary policy can be more coordinated, and liquidity and asset prices can avoid mutually exacerbating crises.
零年利率+QE=饮鸩止渴？近期，国内疫情防控效果明显。
Zero annual interest rate + QE = drinking poison to quench thirst?
但由于防控措施差异，新冠肺炎疫情在全球其他地区呈现出快速蔓延态势。
But due to the difference of control measures, the new crown pneumonia epidemic in the rest of the world shows a rapid spread.
目前，中国以外累计确诊病例突破8.5万例，达86435例。
So far, a total of 85,000 cases have been confirmed outside China, amounting to 86435 cases.
其中，据环球网快讯，美国约翰斯·霍普金斯大学发布的实时统计数据显示，截至北京时间3月16日8时53分，美国新冠肺炎确诊病例已达3499例。
Meanwhile, real-time statistics released by Johns Hopkins University showed 3,399 confirmed cases of pneumonia in the United States by 0853 hours Beijing time on March 16, 2007.
恐慌情绪蔓延至全球资本市场，过去一周，美国及欧洲市场出现剧烈波动，多国股市触及熔断机制，美股更是一周内出现两次“熔断”。
Panic has spread to global capital markets, with US and European markets volatile over the past week, multi-national equity markets touching the meltdown mechanism, and US stocks experiencing "meltdowns" twice a week.
与此同时，为缓解疫情持续恶化带来的经济下行压力，近期全球央行开启了新一轮降息潮。
Meanwhile, central banks around the world have recently launched a new wave of interest rate cuts to ease economic downward pressure from the worsening epidemic.
3月16日凌晨，美联储再次降息（3月3日曾大幅降息50个基点），将联邦基金利率区间下调1个百分点，至0%～0.25%，并表示将购买7000亿美元的国债以及住房抵押贷款支持证券。
In the early morning hours of March 16, the Fed cut interest rates again (it slashed the federal funds rate by 50 basis points on March 3) by 1 percentage point to 0% to 0.25%, and said it would buy $700 billion in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities.
鲍威尔随后的发言中声称，美联储不接受负利率，标志着美联储已经没有继续降息的空间。
In his subsequent remarks, Powell claimed that the Fed's refusal to accept negative interest rates signaled that the Fed had no room to continue cutting rates.
南方基金方面表示，美联储原定于3月17～18日召开会议，宣布利率调整。
The South Fund said the Federal Reserve was scheduled to meet from March 17 to 18 to announce an interest rate adjustment.
但在当地周末临时宣布降息，连两天都不愿意多等，且降息幅度达到100bps，可见美联储的意图是在时间和额度上都超过市场预期，不顾一切向市场输送流动性。
But by temporarily announcing a rate cut over the weekend, unwilling to wait even two days, and slashing interest rates by 100bps, the Fed's intention was to exceed market expectations in terms of time and amount of money and recklessly pump liquidity into the market.
“而市场的反应表现出强烈的悲观情绪，可能源于对美联储黔驴技穷的担心，市场对于美联储后续的财政政策空间持怀疑态度。
"The market's reaction was one of intense pessimism, probably stemming from concerns about the Fed's stuttering of skills and scepticism about the Fed's subsequent fiscal policy space."
”南方基金方面分析，美联储的超预期宽松的原因仍是对冲疫情对经济的影响。
South Fund analysis, the Federal Reserve's reason for ultra-expected easing is still hedging the economic impact of the epidemic.
目前疫情在全球多个国家和地区有失控的迹象，欧洲多国“放弃治疗”，包括英国、德国在内的多个国家采取让更多人感染病毒从而达到“群体免疫”的防疫措施，可能将大幅延长疫情的持续时间。
The epidemic is showing signs of getting out of hand in many countries and regions around the world, with European countries "abandoning treatment," and several countries, including the United Kingdom and Germany, taking preventive measures to increase the number of people infected with the virus, thereby achieving "mass immunization," could significantly extend the duration of the epidemic.
在疫情影响没有好转迹象的情况下，美联储本次紧急临时降息对于未来的市场流动性造成了不良预期，进一步降低了市场的风险偏好。
In the absence of signs of a turnaround in the epidemic's impact, the Fed's emergency temporary rate cut created bad expectations for future market liquidity, further reducing market risk appetite.
同时，在恒大首席经济学家任泽平看来，面对疫情大面积扩散和金融市场崩溃，这一次美联储再次祭出了应对2008年国际金融危机的政策组合“零年利率+QE”，这完全是饮鸩止渴。
Meanwhile, according to Ren Zeping, chief economist of the University of Heng, the US Federal Reserve is once again turning its back on the "zero annual interest rate + QE" policy mix of the 2008 international financial crisis in the face of widespread contagion and financial market meltdown.
“美国这么搞，贸易保护，货币大放水，政治被民粹主义绑架，货币被政治绑架，是在走火入魔，自废武功。
"The United States is playing the devil's advocate, protecting trade, draining the currency, abducting politics by populism and kidnapping the currency politically.
如果中国能推动以新基建和减税为主的财政政策，扩大开放，多层次资本市场建设，再加上改善收入分配和社会治理，国运来了。
If China can push ahead with a fiscal policy that focuses on new infrastructure and tax cuts, greater openness, and a multi-tiered capital market, coupled with improved income distribution and social governance, the MGTO will come.
”他进一步分析。
He analysed further.
任泽平认为，正确的应对方式是尽快控制疫情，以短期代价换取长期胜利，然后以财政政策为主、货币政策为辅来稳增长。
Ren argues that the right response is to bring the epidemic under control as soon as possible, with short-term gains in exchange for long-term success, and then with fiscal policy and monetary policy as a complement to steady growth.
另一方面，对于美联储紧急打出货币政策组合拳，上投摩根基金方面认为，此次政策组合拳有利于缓解家庭和企业面临的现金流风险，防止信用风险迅速上升。
On the other hand, the Federal Reserve's emergency monetary policy portfolio, to invest in Morgan Fund, said the policy mix to ease the cash flow risk faced by households and businesses, to prevent a rapid rise in credit risk.
在货币与财政政策的协调方面，零利率政策也有助于降低美国政府的负债成本，推动相应财政支出计划的实施。
In the coordination of monetary and fiscal policies, zero interest rate policy can also help reduce the cost of government debt and promote the implementation of corresponding fiscal expenditure plans.
此前出台的财政政策则在提供疫情防治费用，以及支持受到冲击的低收入人口和企业部门方面更具针对性。
Previous fiscal policies have been more targeted in terms of providing the cost of fighting the epidemic and supporting the hard-hit low-income population and business sector.
私募排排网未来星基金经理夏风光也向记者指出，当前美股和海外市场的暴跌是流动性危机的一个体现，虽然疫情的冲击对实体经济造成伤害，降息也不能直接解决这些问题，但是稳定好金融市场，确保市场的稳定运行，是改善实体经济的必要条件。
Xia Jing, manager of the private-placement network FutureGlobe Fund, also told reporters that the current plunge in U.S. stocks and overseas markets was a manifestation of the liquidity crisis, and while the shock of the epidemic was hurting the real economy, rate cuts would not directly address those problems, but stabilizing financial markets and ensuring their stable functioning were necessary to improve the real economy.
传导链：情绪危机-金融危机-经济危机降息措施还不足以消弭市场对美股未来走势的担忧。
Conduction Chain: Emotional Crisis - Financial Crisis - Economic Crisis Interest Rate Cuts are not enough to allay fears about the future of U. S. stocks.
上投摩根基金方面指出，由于美国对疫情的防控还处在较早的阶段，市场和美联储也缺乏足够的信息来评估经济受到的影响，而此时利率已经下降至零，这可能导致市场开始担忧美联储还有多少子弹可以在未来使用。
The fund said the market and the Fed lacked sufficient information to assess the impact on the economy, at a time when interest rates had fallen to zero, which could lead to concerns about how many more bullets the Fed could use in the future.
疫情造成的外出减少对服务业将造成冲击，以及油价下行对能源行业的影响，都有可能逐渐显现，这些可能加剧美国经济短期衰退的风险。
The potential impact of the epidemic's reduced travel on the services sector, as well as the impact of lower oil prices on the energy sector, is likely to intensify the risk of a short-term recession in the United States.
伴随疫情数据的逐渐披露，这些担忧可能继续造成市场的大幅波动。
With the gradual disclosure of epidemiological data, these concerns are likely to continue to cause significant market volatility.
国泰君安李少君策略团队于3月15日发布的研报，分析了警惕美股再次探底的三个原因。
Guotai Junan Li Shaojun strategic team released March 15 research paper, analyzed the U. S. stock market once again hit bottom for three reasons.
第一，根据黄金、美债等多资产指征，流动性是美股近期两轮暴跌的促因。
First, liquidity has been the driving force behind the recent two slumps in US stocks, according to multiple asset indicators such as gold and US debt.
大剂量1.5万亿流动性烧褪显效。
High-dose 1.5 trillion-trillion-trillion-fluidity burn fade.
但美股是否完全出清，尚难定论。
But it is far from clear whether the U. S. stock market is completely clear.
李少君团队认为，美股仍面临六个未决的担忧：对疫情的担忧、对经济的担忧、对零工经济（Gig Economy）的担忧、对信用风险的担忧、对不知何时出清的担忧、过高的降息预期。
Mr. Lee's team believes U.S. stocks still face six unresolved concerns: worries about the epidemic, concerns about the economy, worries about the Big Economy, concerns about credit risk, concerns about when to clear the U.S. economy, and excessively high interest-rate cuts.
据测算数据（15%～30%的调整），美股最大调整空间已经接近，但是否触底，还是个曲折反复的过程。
According to the measurement data (15% ~ 30% adjustment), the maximum U.S. stock adjustment space has approached, but whether the bottom is still a tortuous process.
第二，美国疫情发展边界尚未清晰，衰退是不是“技术性”？李少君团队的基本假设是疫情带给美国“技术性”衰退。
Second, the borders of the US epidemic are not clear, and is the recession "technical"? The basic assumption of Li's team is that the epidemic has brought about a "technical" recession in the US.
但这一假设风险有三：其一，美当局是否有足够的准备；其二，美内部是否有足够的凝聚；其三，美措施是否有足够的效率。
But there are three hypothetical risks: first, whether the US authorities are sufficiently prepared; second, whether there is sufficient cohesion within the US; and, third, whether US measures are sufficiently efficient.
明确疫情边界，需要时间。
Defining the borders of the epidemic will take time.
第三，市场受损，冲击消费：美国股市-消费的负反馈似已难免，刺激消费，是减税还是直接补贴中低收入人群，两团体分歧犹存；油价低迷，投资承压：传统能源投资是近年美国私人投资的主要推动部分，但低迷的油价显然会阻碍这一复苏；外贸加力，杯水车薪：向贸易对手要更多，成为一个可能的选项，但恐杯水车薪。
Third, markets are damaged and consumption suffers: negative feedback from US stock markets - consumption cuts or direct subsidies to low- and middle-income groups seem inevitable; oil prices are low and investment is under pressure: conventional energy investments have been a major driver of private investment in recent years, but depressed oil prices have clearly stunted the recovery.
若量宽是针对流动性，那降息已部分表达了美联储对经济的担忧。
If the measure is for liquidity, the rate cut has partly expressed the Fed's concerns about the economy.
明确“衰退”边界，需要时间。
It takes time to define the boundaries of a "recession."
另一方面，近期全球市场的动荡表现令投资者不免联想到2008年的金融危机。
On the other hand, the recent turmoil in global markets is reminiscent of the 2008 financial crisis.
中信证券明明债券研究团队撰写的研究报告指出，回顾过去的两周，全球疫情扩散和石油“黑天鹅”导致全球大部分权益市场陷入技术性熊市，经历了历史性的一周，美股、美债和黄金齐跌反映出美国金融机构流动性堪忧。
In retrospect, the global contagion and the oil swans have plunged most of the world's equity markets into a technical bear market that has seen a historic week in which U.S. stocks, U.S. debt and gold tumbled, according to a study by Citic Securities' bond research team.
对比两次大危机，金融危机的前兆或已出现，按照“情绪危机-金融危机-经济危机”的传导链，目前美国市场可能介于第一和第二阶段之间。
In contrast to the two Great Crises, the harbinger of a financial crisis may have emerged, with the US market now likely to be somewhere between the first and second phases, following the "emotional crisis-financial crisis-economic crisis" transmission chain.
如果能尽快控制疫情，全球货币政策加强协调，避免流动性和资产价格相互恶化，或许就能够避免危机的发生。
If the epidemic can be brought under control soon, global monetary policy can be more coordinated, and liquidity and asset prices can avoid mutually exacerbating crises.
中美利差扩大利于中国债券在海外市场大幅波动影响下，近期A股以震荡走势为主，波动幅度远小于海外市场。
China and the United States to expand interest rate spreads in the overseas market under the impact of large fluctuations in the recent A shares to shock trend-oriented, volatility is much smaller than overseas markets.
3月16日，上证综指失守2800点；北向资金全天净流出98.07亿元。
On March 16, the Shanghai Composite Index lost 2,800 points and the full-day net outflow of funds to the north was 9,807 million yuan.
谈及美国降息对国内的影响，夏风光向记者指出，美联储的降息意味着全球货币宽松的重启，可以有效缓解人民币汇率的压力，给国内的货币政策和财政政策提供了实施空间。
Referring to the domestic impact of US interest rate cuts, Xia told reporters that the Fed's rate cut meant a resumption of global monetary easing, which could effectively ease pressure on the yuan's exchange rate and provide room for domestic monetary and fiscal policy.
国内的疫情结束得早，对经济的冲击也渐趋尾声。
The epidemic in the country ended early, and the impact on the economy was coming to an end.
以旅游景点为例，疫情结束后的复苏叠加海外游的停顿，国内游有可能会迎来一个井喷，对相关上市公司的二季度业绩带来强有力的支持。
At tourist sites, for example, a post-epidemic recovery that adds up to a halt in overseas travel is likely to usher in a blowout that will provide strong support for the second-quarter results of listed companies.
可见当国内疫情结束，各个行业进入到复苏以后，会推升A股的整体盈利水平，这就会增加A股市场的吸引力。
So when the domestic epidemic ends and industries recover, it boosts the overall profitability of A-shares, which makes the A-share market more attractive.
上投摩根基金方面提醒，美联储降息为中国央行释放了进一步宽松的空间，上周五中国央行宣布了定向降准，预计释放近5500亿元流动性。
On Friday, China's central bank announced targeted cuts, expected to release nearly 550 billion yuan of liquidity, as the Fed cut interest rates freeing up further room for easing.
但与此同时，投资者需要密切关注海外经济形势变化对中国经济的潜在影响。
But at the same time, investors need to pay close attention to the potential impact of changes in the overseas economy on China's economy.
就目前而言，中国有力的疫情防控措施，帮助稳定了投资者对中国金融市场与经济的预期，A股在近期海外大幅动荡之中凸显出了韧性和抗跌能力。
For now, China's aggressive epidemic prevention and control measures have helped stabilize investors' expectations of China's financial markets and economy, with A-shares demonstrating resilience and resilience amid the recent turmoil overseas.
平安基金方面认为，当前国内疫情防控得力，经济政策空间具有相当大的灵活性，且经济已转化为内需为主导，因此，投资者对中国经济无须过度悲观。
Ping An Fund believes that the current strong domestic epidemic prevention and control, economic policy space has considerable flexibility, and the economy has been transformed into domestic demand-led, investors need not be overly pessimistic about the Chinese economy.
对于金融市场，央行扩表、公开市场投放、定向降准印证了国内金融上行周期，流动性宽裕环境下，A股可以得到支撑，中长期仍看好A股表现。
For financial markets, central bank expansion, open market placement, and targeted downgrades confirm the domestic financial upside cycle, with A-shares bolstered in an environment of ample liquidity, and positive for A-share performance in the medium to long term.
另一方面，机构普遍看好国内的流动性环境。
On the other hand, institutions are generally bullish on the domestic liquidity environment.
“央行货币政策空间更大，降息、降准仍有空间，流动性整体仍将维持偏松状态。
"Central banks have more room for monetary policy, there is still room to cut interest rates and reduce interest rates, and liquidity as a whole will remain accommodative."
中国央行货币政策空间更大，周末也表态将进一步引导实体融资利率明显下行，即使周末已普惠、定向降准释放了5500亿元的长期资金，预计后期降息、降准仍有空间，流动性整体仍将维持偏松状态，有利于债券市场企稳。
China's central bank has more room for monetary policy, and over the weekend it said it would further guide a significant decline in real-capital interest rates, even though over the weekend inclusive and targeted cuts freed up $550 billion in long-term funds.
”平安基金方面进一步指出，从市场来看，在海外确定性利好和国内基本面利好、货币政策偏松的背景下，债市收益率仍有一定下行空间。
Ping An further pointed out that, from a market point of view, in the context of positive overseas certainty and good domestic fundamentals, loose monetary policy, bond market yields still have some room for decline.
另一方面，与历史相比，国内债市绝对收益率水平较低，事件冲击导致全球金融市场波动较大，国内债市波动也会加大，需持续关注海外疫情防控进展、国内逆周期调控措施，防止市场反复。
On the other hand, the relatively low absolute rate of return on domestic debt markets, the volatility of global financial markets and the volatility of domestic debt markets as a result of such shocks will require sustained attention to the progress of overseas disease prevention and control, domestic countercyclical control measures and the prevention of market reversals.
上投摩根基金方面也分析，对债市而言，美联储降息后中美利差继续扩大，则有助于中国债券的表现。
For the bond market, continued widening spreads after the Fed cut interest rates would help China's bond performance, according to Morgan Fund analysis.
