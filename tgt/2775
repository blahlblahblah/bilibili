“之前你们帮了我这么多，现在换我们一起帮助社区。
"After all you've done for me, let's help the community together.
”记者 | 应　琛3月3日，静安区芷江西路街道协和居委会来了两位特殊的居民。
At the request of Ren & # 124; # 124; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; Two special residents arrived.
他们是刚刚完成了14天集中隔离观察的严小姐和她的外甥小周。
They were Miss Yan and her nephew Zhou, who had just completed a 14-day intensive quarantine.
“上海真是一座包容、大气的城市，上海的居委会干部都是我们群众的贴心人！”严小姐真诚地向最近一直默默帮助和鼓励他们的居委会干部表示感谢。
"Shanghai is really a tolerant, atmospheric city, Shanghai's neighborhood committee cadres are our people's intimate!" Miss Yan sincerely to the recently has silently helped and encouraged their neighborhood cadres.
当天临走前，居委会还给了严小姐一些消毒和防疫用品，叮嘱他们做好防疫工作。
Before leaving that day, the neighborhood committee also gave some disinfection and epidemic prevention supplies to Miss Yan, telling them to do a good job of immunization.
严小姐和小周对协和居委会表示感谢事情还要追溯到2月12日，当天临近午休的时候，协和居委会主任蔡琴接到了一个求助电话。
"Miss Yan and Zhou thanked the committee, which dates back to Feb. 12, when Cai Qin, director of the neighborhood committee, received a call for help.
打电话的人是在居委会辖区内的某个小区住了十多年的周先生。
The caller was Mr. Zhou, who had lived in a neighborhood for more than 10 years.
因为之前周先生是小区垃圾分类的志愿者，蔡琴和他是比较熟悉的。
Because before Mr. Zhou is a community garbage classification volunteers, Cai Qin and he are relatively familiar.
但电话那头，周先生虽然显得很着急，但说话却又吞吞吐吐。
But at the other end of the line, Mr. Zhou, though worried, hesitated.
原来周先生是湖北荆州人，和往年一样，春节前夕就回到了老家和妻儿团聚。
The original Mr. Zhou is Hubei Jingzhou people, and as usual, Spring Festival Eve back home with his wife and children.
当时虽然已经有了一些关于新冠肺炎的报道，但1月21日，小姨子严小姐还是带着儿子小周按计划从武汉出发去往泰国曼谷自由行。
Although there had been some reports of new crowns pneumonia, on January 21, the younger sister-in-law and her son, Xiao Zhou, set off from Wuhan on a planned trip to Bangkok, Thailand.
但随着国内疫情的暴发，武汉“封城”，泰国取消了所有飞往武汉的航班，其中也包括他们原定于1月29日的返程航班，严小姐和小周无心再继续游玩，每天待在酒店房间通过电话打听回国的消息。
But with the outbreak of a domestic epidemic, Wuhan "closed the city," Thailand cancelled all flights to Wuhan, including their scheduled return flight on January 29, Miss Yan and Xiaozhou no longer have the heart to continue to play, stay in hotel rooms every day to inquire about the news of return home by telephone.
应外交部的要求，1月31日，民航局派出了两架民航加班航班，由厦门航空执飞，分别从泰国曼谷、马来西亚哥打基纳巴卢运送滞留在当地的湖北籍旅客返回武汉。
At the request of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on 31 January, the Civil Aviation Administration dispatched two civilian overtime flights operated by Xiamen Airlines to transport stranded Hubei passengers back to Wuhan from Bangkok, Thailand, and Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia.
资料图：民航局根据国家统一部署派出包机接回滞留泰国的湖北籍游客　摄｜王国安“严小姐应该也是联系过中国驻泰国大使馆，知道有包机回国一事。
civil aviation authority send chartered flights to take back tourists from Hubei province staying in Thailand according to the unified plan of the country, Ms. Yan should have contacted the Chinese Embassy in Thailand to know about the chartered flights.
但一来她们家在荆州，就算回到武汉，也不一定能回家；二来，武汉当时在她看来并不安全。
But first their home in Jingzhou, even back to Wuhan, may not be able to go home; secondly, Wuhan at the time did not seem to her safe.
所以两人没有选择乘坐包机回武汉。
So they did not choose to return to Wuhan by charter flight.
”蔡琴告诉《新民周刊》，两人的泰国落地签证二月初也已经到期，后来在当地又延了一次。
"Chua told Xinmin Weekly that their Thai visa on arrival had expired in early February and had been extended there once more.
一直到2月10日，在曼谷滞留了近20天，由于长时间的焦虑，小周突然出现了发烧的症状。
He remained in Bangkok for nearly 20 days until February 10, when he suddenly developed fever as a result of prolonged anxiety.
严小姐赶紧带着他前往当地医院就医。
Miss Yan rushed him to the local hospital.
后经泰国防疫部门检验，虽然排除了新冠肺炎，但眼看着他们的泰国落地签证又即将到期。
Thailand's vaccination department after the exclusion of pneumonia, but saw their Thai visa on arrival is about to expire.
“周先生想到自己在上海有固定居住地，两人或许可以直接回上海。
"Mr Zhou thought he had a fixed place of residence in Shanghai and maybe they could go straight back to Shanghai.
但因为不知道上海具体的规定，也不知道小区让不让非居民进入，听得出来他也是硬着头皮给我打了这个电话。
But because did not know Shanghai specific regulation, also did not know the district lets not allow the non-resident to enter, can hear him also to bravely make this call to me.
”蔡琴坦言，当时正逢第二轮口罩预约登记工作即将开始，整体防疫工作仍处于压力较大的状态，周先生的请求犹如一个“烫手的山芋”。
Mr Chua admitted that the registration of the second round of masks was about to begin, and that the overall epidemic prevention work was still under pressure.
但她仍然第一时间安抚了周先生的情绪，又将此事汇报给了居委会书记。
But she still calmed Mr. Zhou's mood for the first time and reported the matter to the secretary of the neighborhood committee.
“其实中间有过纠结，但最后还是决定尝试着帮助他们。
"There was some confusion, but in the end I decided to try to help them.
”蔡琴和居民区党总支书记向街道党工委请示,主要领导高度重视,当即向有关部门了解政策和听取意见后，终将可以“回上海”的好消息告诉了周先生，同时又加了严小姐的微信，直接指导他们所需要的材料，“身份证、护照和出入境记录之外，我还让他们开了当地医院的健康证明，以及提供从荆州去武汉的出行记录，如高铁票等等。
"Cai qin and the general secretary of the residential party asked the street party committee for instructions. The main leaders took the policy and comments very seriously and immediately told Mr. Zhou the good news of" going back to Shanghai "with a message directly instructing them on the materials they needed.
此外，根据当时上海的防控要求，入沪还只需要在‘健康云’上申报”。
In addition, according to the then Shanghai control requirements, only "health cloud" declaration is required to enter Shanghai.
在不确定严小姐和小周的隔离方式前，居委会同时也做好了万全准备，对周先生家小区和楼道进行了全面的消毒，明确了居家隔离志愿者，为两人可能需要的居家隔离进行服务。
Before the uncertainty about the isolation of Miss Yan and Xiao Zhou, the neighborhood committee was also fully prepared to carry out a complete disinfection of Mr. Zhou's residential area and corridor, identified isolated volunteers at home, and provided services for the two of them who might need to be separated at home.
蔡琴每天还通过微信和严小姐联系，了解他们的身体状况和行程安排，提醒他们相关的注意事项，告知居委会做好准备，欢迎他们回来，缓解其焦虑情绪。
Cai also contacted Ms. Yan daily by microphone to find out about their health and itinerary, remind them of the relevant precautions, inform the neighborhood committee to be ready to welcome them back and ease their anxiety.
资料图：浦东机场集中了多数国际航班，上海海关卫生检疫工作人员频频登上航班进行登临检查2月16日晚11点，严小姐和小周登上了返沪的航班。
Photo: Pudong Airport is home to most international flights. Shanghai Customs health and quarantine staff frequently board flights for boarding and inspection. On February 16 at 11 pm, Miss Yan and Xiao Zhou boarded the flight back to Shanghai.
当飞机于17日凌晨在浦东国际机场降落时，严小姐又按照蔡琴的指导，向海关等部门如实汇报了自己的情况。
When the plane landed in Pudong International Airport in the early hours of the 17th, Miss Yan followed Cai Qin's guidance and reported to the customs and other departments truthfully.
“他们后来是在机场就直接被送往了指定的集中隔离点，进行14天隔离。
"They were then taken directly to a designated central isolation point at the airport for 14 days.
”在集中隔离期间，蔡琴依旧经常发去问候，叮嘱他们安心隔离，隔离结束回家后有任何需求居委都将全力解决。
During the period of intensive quarantine, Cai continued to send greetings regularly, telling them to keep their isolation safe, and that any demands from the neighborhood would be fully met when they returned home from isolation.
严小姐向居委会表达了愿意做防疫志愿者的想法3月3日，解除隔离的二人终于回到家中，放下行李后就立即赶到居委会表达谢意。
The two men finally returned home, laid down their luggage and rushed to the neighborhood committee to express their thanks.
严小姐表示，小周会在家里上网课，而自己因为单位还未复工，在上海的这段时间愿意来居委会做志愿者，和大家一起共同抗疫。
Miss Yan said Xiao Zhou would have Internet classes at home, but because his unit has not returned to work, the time in Shanghai would like to volunteer with the neighborhood committee to fight against the disease.
3月4日，居委会干部上门慰问，要求他们配合物业遵守进出小区的要求，并叮嘱做好个人防护，有困难可以随时找居委会“之前你们帮了我这么多，现在换我们一起帮助社区。
On March 4, neighborhood committee officials came to express solicitude to the residents, asking them to cooperate with the property to comply with the requirements of entering and leaving the community, and to ask for personal protection. "Before you helped me so much, we helped the community together.
”严小姐说道。
