我们该从疫情中获取怎样的“抗体”和“免疫力”？1月29日，大年初五，在武汉市汉口解放大道，一位被确诊新冠肺炎的患者正在转院。
What kind of antibodies and immunity should we get from the outbreak On January 29, at Hankou Liberation Road, Wuhan, a patient diagnosed with New Crown Pneumonia was transferred to hospital.
­摄影/长江日报 金思柳疫情“罗生门”：患者、医者、决策者《中国慈善家》记者/温如军 吴可言发表于《中国慈善家》2020年2月号一个城市改变整个国家的步调，这样的时刻，在共和国历史上并不多见。
THE CHINESE SOCIETY / CHINA SOCIETY (Reuters) - Chinese philanthropist Wen Rujun Wu is one of the few times in the history of the Republic when a city changes the pace of an entire country.
这是一场旷日持久的“战疫”。
It was a long-drawn out epidemic.
从元旦到春节，直至春暖花开的季节，人们依然没有看到鸣锣收兵的迹象。
From New Year's Day to the Spring Festival, until the spring blooming season, people still do not see signs of the gongs closing.
风起于青萍之末。
The wind blows at the end of green.
回头看去，在2019与2020的新旧交替之际，这座城市到底发生了什么？医者、患者、决策者，本应是公共卫生体系中良性互动的基本关系，如何演化成了“不可能三角”？痛定思痛，我们又该从疫情中获取怎样的“抗体”和“免疫力”？第一章：生死线上的患者逝去的、幸存的、等待的，在这场“战疫”中，他们无法左右自己的命运。
Looking back, what is happening in the city at the turn of 2019 and 2020? How do doctors, patients, and policymakers, who are supposed to be the basis of healthy interactions in the public-health system, evolve into "impossible triangles"?
逝者今年67岁的王壮壮是一名普通退休工人，家族有心脏遗传疾病。
The deceased, Wang Zhuang, 67, is an ordinary retired worker whose family has inherited heart disease.
从怀疑感冒住院到“重症肺炎”死亡，只有14天。
Only 14 days passed from being hospitalized with a suspected cold to dying of severe pneumonia.
他是第一位在这场疫情中死去的患者，但不属于确诊病例，也没有出现在政府公布的死亡名单中，死亡证明上写着“重症肺炎”。
He was the first person to die from the outbreak, but it was not a confirmed case and did not appear on the government's official death list, which says "Severe pneumonia."
2019年12月23日起，王壮壮先后在武汉协和肿瘤医院、协和医院、金银潭医院治疗，但最终于2020年1月7日在金银潭医院不治身亡。
On December 23, 2019, Wang Zhuang was treated at Wuhan Concorde Oncology Hospital, Concorde Hospital and Gold and Silver Pool Hospital, but eventually died on January 7, 2020 at the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital.
病人去世后，院方曾要求家属捐献遗体供医学解剖，遭家属拒绝后遗体于当天火化。
After the death of the patient, the hospital asked the family to donate the body for a medical autopsy. The body was cremated the same day after the family refused.
医生告诉家属，王壮壮是这场疫情中的第一个死亡病例。
The doctor told the family that Wang Zhuang was the first case of death from the outbreak.
王壮壮究竟是怎么被感染的，家属到现在也不知道。
How Wang Zhuang is infected after all, family members do not know.
2019年12月20日，他感觉身体不适并一直打嗝，连着3天停不下来。
On 20 December 2019, he felt unwell and belched for three days without stopping.
王壮壮的爱人处于胰腺癌晚期，一直在武汉协和肿瘤医院治疗，每隔半个月要到医院取药。
Wang Zhuang's wife is in the advanced stage of pancreatic cancer, has been in Wuhan Concorde Cancer Hospital treatment, every half a month to get medicine.
因此，王壮壮也来到该医院检查。
Therefore, Wang Zhuang also came to the hospital to check.
当时，对普通市民来说“新冠肺炎”是一个完全陌生的概念，王壮壮只是怀疑自己感冒了。
At the time, "New Crown Pneumonia" for the general public is a completely unfamiliar concept, Wang Zhuang only suspected that he caught a cold.
在这家中西医结合医院，医生给他把脉，并告知他心率不齐。
At this Chinese-Western hospital, the doctor felt his pulse and told him that his heart rate was irregular.
“我们家族确实有心脏方面的遗传病。
"We do have a heart condition in our family.
”王壮壮的妹妹王兰告诉《中国慈善家》，但她并没有把这一信息告诉医生。
Wang Zhuang's sister, Wang Lan, told China Philanthropists, but she did not share the information with her doctor.
进一步听诊后，医生建议王壮壮拍肺部CT，结果显示肺部感染。
After further auscultation, the doctor suggested Wang Zhuang take lung CT, the result shows lung infection.
医生建议住院治疗，王兰于当天办理了住院手续。
The doctor recommended hospitalization, Wang Lan the same day to go through the procedure.
“医院刚开始按肺气肿来治疗，用的是一些中药。
"The hospital has just started treating emphysema with some Chinese medicine.
”王兰说，由于自己住得离医院远，她经常在电话里和哥哥沟通病情，每次通话都感觉他的病情在加重。
Wang said that because she lived far from the hospital, she often talked to her brother on the phone and felt his condition was getting worse every time she spoke to him.
“我怎么感觉住院之后越来越难受了。
"I felt worse after I was admitted to the hospital.
”12月29日，王壮壮告诉王兰。
On December 29, Wang Zhuang told Wang Lan.
电话里，妹妹能听出来他说话时在喘气。
On the phone, my sister could recognize him gasping for breath as he spoke.
12月30日，王兰花了一个小时坐地铁来到肿瘤医院，当时正是中午，她对值班护士提出想找主治大夫了解哥哥的病情，护士告诉她医生两点半上班。
On December 30, Wang took the subway for an hour to the oncology hospital. It was noon when she told the nurse on duty that she wanted to see the doctor about her brother's condition.
看到病情加重的哥哥，王兰坚持要见主治医生，情绪有些激动。
See the disease aggravated brother, Wang Lan insisted to see the attending doctor, some emotion.
护士通过电话将情况电话告诉了医生。
The nurse telephoned the doctor about the situation.
随后，王兰见到医生，问哥哥得的究竟是什么病，为什么这么长时间不见好反而加重了？双方语言有冲突，医生不满王兰对其“治疗方案”的质疑。
Later, Wang Lan saw the doctor and asked him what the disease was and why he had not seen him for so long.
“这个你要问X教授，方子是他开的。
"You'll have to ask Professor X that he opened Fang Zi.
”医生说。
'said the doctor.
X教授出面没有解释太多，只是告诉家属，如果对医院不信任，今天就办出院。
Professor X did not explain much, but told his family that if he did not trust the hospital, he would be discharged today.
王壮壮在出院责任书上签了字，他让女儿王倩挂了第二天武汉协和医院的普通内科号。
Wang Zhuang signed the discharge responsibility letter, he let his daughter Wang Qian hang the next day Wuhan Concorde Hospital general internal medicine number.
由于已是晚上，他们没有离开肿瘤医院。
As it was evening, they did not leave the oncology hospital.
当天，坊间流出一份据称是武汉市卫健委所发的《关于做好不明原因肺炎救治工作的紧急通知》。
On the same day, there was an alleged "emergency notice on the treatment of pneumonia due to unknown causes" issued by Wuhan Health Commission.
这份通知显示，武汉市部分医疗机构陆续出现不明原因肺炎病人，要求各有关医疗机构做好医疗救治工作。
The notice showed that some medical institutions in Wuhan were suffering from unexplained pneumonia, and requested the relevant medical institutions to do a good job in medical treatment.
这是“新冠肺炎”出现的最早的一个信号。
It was the first sign of a new crown pneumonia.
第二天，武汉市卫健委发布了第一则通报：近期部分医疗机构发现接诊的多例肺炎病例与华南海鲜市场有关联，已发现27例病例，其中7例病情严重，其余病例病情稳定可控，有2例病情好转，拟于近期出院。
The next day, Wuhan Health Commission issued the first notice: Recently, some medical institutions found that the admission of many cases of pneumonia and South China seafood market, has found 27 cases, of which 7 cases are serious, the others are stable and controllable, and 2 cases are expected to be released in the near future.
这是首次对于“新冠肺炎”的认知——“病毒性肺炎”，通报明确，此时病毒未发现明显人传人现象，未发现医务人员感染。
This is the first time "new crown pneumonia" knowledge - "viral pneumonia," a clear notification, when the virus found no significant human-to-human phenomenon, no medical staff found infection.
王壮壮在家属的陪同下来到协和医院，此时的他走路需要有人搀扶，而且走两步就大喘气。
Wang Zhuang accompanied by his family to the Concorde Hospital, at this time he needs someone to help him walk, and two steps on a big panting.
“你这病我们普通内科治不了，你现在必须去挂急诊。
"We can't cure you of this illness. You must go to the emergency room now.
”医生看完后告诉他们。
"The doctor read it and told them.
急诊科医生要求拍肺部CT。
The emergency doctor asked for a lung CT.
结果出来后，家属将1月23日拍的CT片一同给医生看，时隔仅一周，医生竟不敢相信这是同一人：肺已经全变白了。
When the results came out, the family showed the doctor a CT scan taken on January 23. After only a week, the doctor could not believe it was the same person: the lungs had turned white.
医生怀疑是艾滋病，肺部形态几乎和艾滋病晚期病人是一致的。
Doctors suspect AIDS, and the lung shape is almost identical to the terminal AIDS patients.
王壮壮又被安排做了甲流、梅毒、艾滋检测，结果均呈阴性。
Wang Zhuang Zhuang is arranged to do A flow, syphilis, AIDS test, the result is negative.
随后，医生给家属下了病危通知单，并告诉家属：如果治疗的话很可能人财两空，治还是放弃？得到家属肯定回答后，协和医院将呼吸科的专家请来会诊。
Then the doctor gave the family a critical notice and told them that if they were treated, they would probably get money to pay for it or give it up.After getting a positive answer from family members, Concorde Hospital called in a respiratory specialist.
2020年1月1日，王壮壮转到呼吸科ICU病房。
On January 1, 2020, Wang Zhuang was transferred to the ICU unit of the respiratory department.
医生告诉家属，王壮壮得的病只知道是病毒性感染，但查不到病毒是什么，没有办法治疗，只能把现有的抗生素全用上。
The doctor told his family that Wang Zhuang's disease was only known to be a viral infection, but could not find out what the virus was.
“我们也表示理解，毕竟得了一种之前没有见过的病，谁也没有办法。
"We also understood that we had a disease that we had not seen before and that no one could do anything about it.
”不管是女儿王倩还是妹妹王兰，都只有一个愿望，就是让亲人好起来，哪怕只有1%的希望也要试试。
Whether her daughter Wang Qian or her sister Wang Lan, they only have one wish - to make their loved ones feel good, even if only 1% of them want to try it.
在各种方法和药物都用完的情况下，1月3日，医生建议家属将病人转到金银潭医院救治。
On January 3, doctors advised the family to refer the patient to a gold-and-silver-pond hospital for treatment after all methods and drugs had been exhausted.
在转院问题上，王兰和王倩商量后一致认为，只能听医生建议，没有别的办法。
In the transfer issue, Wang Lan and Wang Qian after consulting, can only listen to the doctor's advice, there is no other way.
这时，王壮壮要靠呼吸机续命，但神志清醒。
At this time, Wang Zhuang Zhuang to rely on breathing machine to survive, but conscious.
王兰问他：“插上呼吸机感觉好点了吗？”，得到的回答是“一下子感觉从地狱上了天堂”。
Wang Lan asked him, "Is it better to put on the ventilator?" The answer was "All of a sudden I felt like I was in heaven from hell."
想不到的是，这竟成了王壮壮留给家属的最后一句话。
Unexpectedly, this turned out to be the last word that Wang Zhuang left to his family.
幸存者吴先生是武汉疫情中第一位治愈出院的重症患者，2019年12月底，他被感染新型冠状病毒，一度住进重症监护室，与死神擦肩而过。
Wu, the first serious patient in Wuhan to be cured, was infected with a new coronavirus at the end of December 2019. He was admitted to the intensive care unit and passed death.
他曾在重症监护室盯着天花板两夜没合眼，怕自己睡着就再也醒不来。
He had been staring at the ceiling in the intensive care unit for two nights, afraid he would never wake up from sleep.
出院后隔离14天后，他除干咳外无其他症状。
After 14 days of isolation, he had no symptoms other than dry cough.
吴先生是湖北黄冈人，在当地一家菜市场从事家禽经营，虽然从未去过武汉华南海鲜市场，但与从那里进货的商户经常往来。
Wu, a Huanggang native of Huanggang, works as a poultry trader in a local market and has never been to Wuhan South China Seafood Market.
去年12月底，他发现自己“感冒”了，一点食欲也没有，几天基本没吃东西，然后就是发高烧。
At the end of December, he found himself with a "cold," no appetite, few days of eating, and then a high fever.
因为父亲刚刚去世，吴先生没有时间去就医。
As his father had just died, Mr. Wu had no time to see a doctor.
拖了一个星期，他才去了医院，拍片结果显示，右肺出现阴影。
It took him a week to get to the hospital and the results showed a shadow in his right lung.
他接受了三天消炎输液治疗，再拍肺部CT片，双肺都出现阴影。
He received three days of anti-inflammatory transfusion treatment, and then took a lung CT, both lungs appear shadow.
“我身体平时非常好，很少去医院，感冒三两天基本就好了，但这次情况不一般。
"I'm usually in good health and seldom go to the hospital. I've had a cold for three or two days, but this time it's not unusual.
”吴先生告诉《中国慈善家》。
Mr Wu told Philanthropists in China.
感冒拖了一周、输液三天不见好转，双肺又出现问题，这让吴先生一下子紧张起来。
Cold drag a week, infusion did not improve for three days, lung problems again, this makes Mr. Wu suddenly nervous.
三年前，一个亲戚就因感冒拖时间太久转成肺炎，最后肾衰竭去世。
Three years ago, a relative caught a cold for too long before he developed pneumonia and eventually died of kidney failure.
他和家人商量了一番，1月5日，救护车直接将他送到武汉治疗。
After a discussion with his family, on 5 January, the ambulance took him directly to Wuhan for treatment.
这时，武汉协和医院和同济医院已经人满为患，没有床位。
By this time, Wuhan Concorde Hospital and Tongji Hospital were already overcrowded and had no beds.
来到武汉大学中南医院，也同样没有床位。
Come to Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital, there are no beds.
一来二去，又耽误了两天。
Another two days were lost.
1月7日，吴先生高烧39.3度，出现呼吸困难症状，中南医院的医生见状马上给他安排了临时床位。
On 7 January, Mr. Wu had a high fever of 39.3 degrees, presenting with respiratory symptoms, and the doctor at the South-Central Hospital arranged a temporary bed for him as soon as he saw him.
随后拍摄的CT片显示，双肺已发白。
Subsequent CT images showed that both lungs had turned white.
经紧急讨论，院方综合评估吴先生各项指标后，对他采用体外膜肺氧合(ECMO)技术治疗。
After an urgent discussion, the hospital conducted a comprehensive evaluation of Mr. Wu's indicators and used extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to treat him.
他成了武汉疫情中首位使用该技术治疗的患者。
He became the first Wuhan patient to be treated with the technique.
2月9日，武汉市红十字会医院ICU病房，重症监护室主任彭勇（右一）手持掌上超声仪协助四川省人民医院重症医学中心主任黄晓波（中）运用ECMO技术共同抢救重症患者。
February 9, Wuhan Red Cross Hospital ICU ward, intensive care unit director Peng Yong (first from the right) held a hand-held ultra-acoustic device to help Sichuan Province People's Hospital Center for Severe Acute Medicine Huang Xiaobo (middle) use ECMO technology to rescue seriously ill patients.
摄影/湖北日报 柯皓“ECMO技术并不是‘杀死’病毒，更准确地说，它是一种辅助治疗手段。
Photography / Hubei Daily: "ECMO technology is not 'killing' the virus; rather, it is an adjunct to treatment.
”武汉大学中南医院急救中心副主任夏剑表示，新型冠状病毒感染的患者肺部受损，在人体外安放人工膜肺替代肺的工作，帮助患者渡过最艰难的时刻。
Xia Jian, deputy director of the emergency centre at Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital, said patients with the new coronavirus had lung damage and had their lungs replaced by artificial membranes outside the body to help patients through the most difficult times.
待患者的肺能够承担机体功能时，人工心肺仪就可以撤掉。
Artificial cardiopulmonary bypass can be removed when the lungs of the patient are able to function.
此时，吴先生意识清醒，打麻药、上人工呼吸机和增氧机、做心电图……这一系列动作他都记得，但身体虚弱到连手都无法抬不起。
At this point, Mr. Wu conscious, anaesthesia, artificial respirator and oxygen booster, do electrocardiogram... he remembers the series of actions, but is too weak to lift his hands.
他感觉浑身发冷，示意医生给自己加盖了一床被子。
Feeling chilled, he motioned to the doctor to cover himself with a quilt.
他感到特别困，拼命握紧拳头，脚上也不断使劲，强忍着不让自己睡着。
He felt particularly sleepy, clenching his fists and trying to keep his feet from falling asleep.
就这样，他盯着天花板，两天两夜没有合眼。
So he stared at the ceiling and did not sleep for two days or nights.
“睡着了以后人的意志力会薄弱，我怕再也醒不来了。
'Will power is weak after sleep, and I'm afraid I won't wake up again.
”吴先生说。
"said Mr. Wu.
在重症监护室，他每天输液，不停地抽血做生物指标检查，量体温、测血压、测心跳。
In the intensive care unit, he injects fluids every day, constantly pumping blood for biomarkers, measuring body temperature, blood pressure and heartbeat.
经过五天密集治疗，吴先生的状态开始有了好转，明显感觉身体在一点点恢复。
After five days of intensive treatment, Mr. Wu's condition began to improve, with a palpable sense of physical recovery.
就连医生也被他的意志力所感动，每次查房都给他竖起大拇指。
Even the doctor was moved by his willpower and gave him a thumbs-up every time he visited the room.
从需要医生喂饭到自己拿起筷子，从动弹不得到在医生搀扶下下地挪动，吴先生说，“是信念一直支撑着我。
From feeding the doctor to picking up the chopsticks himself, moving from arm to arm with the doctor, Mr. Wu said, Faith has been holding me up.
”五天后的CT片显示，他的肺部出现明显好转，随后他被转到普通病房。
A CT scan five days later showed a marked improvement in his lungs, before he was transferred to the general ward.
1月28日，吴先生正式出院，成为这次疫情中第一位康复出院的重症患者。
On January 28, Mr. Wu was officially discharged from the hospital, becoming the first serious patient to recover from the outbreak.
出院时吴先生问医生，自己的身体以后会不会有后遗症，医生告诉他：“从CT片上的情况来看，你的肺恢复了90%，基本上和正常人一样，不会有什么后遗症。
When he was discharged from the hospital, Mr. Wu asked the doctor if his body would have sequelae. The doctor told him, "Judging from the CT scan, your lung has recovered by 90% and is basically the same as a normal person with no sequelae.
”等待者等待多日，闵先生还是没有等到一张床位。
After waiting many days, Mr. Min did not wait for a bed.
今年44岁的他是一名货车司机，曾在汶川大地震中义务为政府部门运送物资。
He is a 44-year-old truck driver who volunteered supplies for government departments during the Wenchuan earthquake.
从1月22日起，闵先生反复高烧，在武汉市东西湖人民医院检查发现双肺病变，属于新冠肺炎“高度疑似”患者。
From 22 January onwards, Mr. Min repeatedly high fever, in Wuhan East-West Lake People's Hospital found two lung lesions, belonging to the "high suspected" patients of the new crown pneumonia.
2月2日，他已发展到重症呼吸窘迫，无法行走、进食。
On 2 February, he developed severe respiratory distress and was unable to walk or eat.
初诊时属于疑似病例，只能在家自行隔离，到了后期重症阶段又无法收治。
At the beginning of the diagnosis is a suspected case, can only be isolated at home, to the later stage of severe illness and unable to receive treatment.
在武汉市，与闵先生有类似情况、一样无法找到床位的病人不在少数。
In Wuhan, there are many patients who have similar circumstances as well as those who are unable to find a bed.
朋友圈和微博上，到处都是需要病床的求助信。
Friends circles and microblogs are filled with requests for help that require beds.
更让闵先生一家焦虑的是，两个孩子也出现了类似新冠肺炎的症状，一家老小的命运不知何去何从。
Even more worrying for the Min family, the two children also developed symptoms similar to the new crown pneumonia, the fate of the family did not know what to do.
王科带着72岁的老人一连跑了4家医院，病床都已满了，但他没有放弃，最后协和医院收治了老人。
Wang Ko and his 72-year-old went to four hospitals, full of beds, but he did not give up, finally Concorde hospital admitted the elderly.
摄影/长江日报 金振强1月30日上午，武汉协和医院发热门诊前排起了长队，穿着防护衣的工作人员引导患者就诊并维持秩序。
Photo / Changjiang Daily Jin Zhenqiang January 30 morning, Wuhan Concorde Hospital fever clinic in front of a long queue, wearing protective clothing staff guide patients to see and maintain order.
已经连续发烧4天的王先生瘫坐在医院旁的马路牙子上，他已经被确诊为新冠病毒感染者，但医院根本没有床位。
Mr. Wang, who has been feverish for four days, collapsed in the street next to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with the new crown virus but had no beds at all.
“每天的疑似病例和确诊病例人数增长太快了，实在没有办法。
"The daily number of suspected and confirmed cases is rising too fast to do anything about it.
”协和医院宣传部门一位负责人告诉《中国慈善家》。
"China Philanthropists," a director of the advocacy department at Concorde Hospital told China Philanthropists.
1月28日，国家卫健委医政医管局副局长焦雅辉在新闻发布会上表示，武汉将通过“10+10”模式，即10家大医院出人员、出技术、出力量，征用10家中小型医院出场地、出床位和医务人员，作为定点医院收治疑似病例和确诊病例。
On January 28, the Deputy Director of the Hospital Authority, Jiao Yahui, said at a press conference that Wuhan would recruit 10 small and medium-sized hospitals to treat suspected and confirmed cases through the "10 + 10" model, in which 10 major hospitals provide personnel, skills and strength.
尽管如此，当前发病人数还在上升。
Nevertheless, the number of cases is still on the rise.
床位紧张的另一客观原因是，很多医院缺乏符合要求的隔离病房，普通病房无法防控病毒，而隔离病房的要求很高，除了分区设置隔离外，室内设备、甚至空调系统都有严格要求，很多医院无法完全做到。
Another objective reason for the shortage of beds is the lack of adequate isolation rooms in many hospitals, the inability of general wards to control the virus, and the high requirements of isolation wards, which many hospitals are unable to fully meet, in addition to the strict requirements of partitioning and even air-conditioning systems.
2月5日，由武汉国际会展中心改造的方舱医院，医护人员在整理床位。
February 5, Wuhan International Convention and Exhibition Center renovation of the cabin hospital, hospital staff in the bed.
摄影/《中国慈善家》记者 温如军共计2500多张床位的火神山和雷神山两座临时医院建起来了，1万多个床位的方舱医院建起来了。
Photography / China Philanthropists Reporter WenRu Jun total more than 2,500 beds of fire god mountain and Lei Shenshan two temporary hospitals have been built, more than 10,000 beds square hospital has been built.
2月5日，湖北省新型肺炎防控指挥部会议强调，加快解决床位紧张问题，确保“应收尽收、应治尽治”。
February 5, Hubei Province, the new command of the Pneumonia prevention and control stressed that the solution to the problem of bed tension, to ensure "receivable, should be treated.
同一天，国际公共卫生专家、美国加州大学洛杉矶分校（UCLA）公共卫生学院副院长张作风在接受《中国慈善家》杂志专访时建议，应该把更多的精力放在湖北，以及与湖北邻接的河南、湖南的病人上面，不仅仅是疑似患者诊断，更重要的是对发烧门诊及有发烧咳嗽和其他症状的人进行诊断，把可疑病人变成确诊病人。
On the same day, Zhang style, an international public health expert and vice-dean of the UCLA School of Public Health, suggested in an interview with Chinese philanthropist magazine that more effort should be devoted not only to diagnosing suspected patients, but also to diagnosing fever clinics and people with fever, cough, and other symptoms.
只有把潜在病人诊断出来，全国才有希望看到拐点。
Only by diagnosing the potential patients can the country hope to see the inflection point.
“拐点”在一周后来临。
The inflection point will come in a week.
据国家卫健委通报，2月12日0时-24时，湖北省新增新冠肺炎病例14840例（武汉市13436例），全省累计病亡1310例（其中：武汉市1036例）。
Between 0000 and 2400 hours on February 12, 14,840 new cases of pneumonia were reported in Hubei Province (13,436 cases in Wuhan), and 1,310 cases (1,036 of them in Wuhan) were reported.
在不绝于耳的求助声中，在地毯式搜救来临前，有多少人在绝望中等待甚至失去生命？已无法一一统计。
How many people waited in despair and even lost their lives before carpet search and rescue came amid endless calls for help? It is impossible to count.
第二章：夹缝中的医者从2019年12月初发现病例、2020年1月初出现一定规模病人传染，武汉当地对外发布消息称“未发现明显人传人”，所有人都信了。
Chapter 2: Healthcare in the crevice from early December 2019, the emergence of a certain scale of infection in early January 2020, Wuhan local news announced that "no obvious person-to-person", everyone believed.
于是，1000多万武汉市民加上近500万流动人口在一座没有任何防护措施的城市随意流动。
As a result, more than 10 million Wuhan city residents plus nearly 5 million mobile population in a city without any protection measures at will.
“以一个医生的常识判断，这种病不可能不会发生人传人。
"Judging by the common sense of a doctor, it's impossible to avoid a human-to-human transmission.
”一线医生作为亲历者、吹哨人，他们的专业判断和直观感受却被忽视，直至疫情大爆发。
First-line doctors, as witnesses and whistleblowers, were ignored in their professional judgment and intuition until the outbreak.
“心里都明白”2019年12月26日上午，湖北省中西医结合医院收治了附近小区的一对老夫妻，他们因发烧、咳嗽自己步行到医院看病，该院呼吸与重症医学科主任张继先看了CT片后发现，他们的肺部都呈现出与其他病毒性肺炎完全不同的症状。
On the morning of December 26, 2019, the Hubei Provincial Chinese and Western Medical Association Hospital admitted an elderly couple who had walked to the hospital with fever and cough. Zhang Jixian, director of the department of respiratory and severe medicine, had taken a look at CT images and found that their lungs were completely different from those of other viral pneumonia.
临床经验丰富的张继先第一时间想到了传染病，她让老两口叫来他们的儿子做检查，没有任何症状，但CT一照，肺部也有同样表现。
Zhang, a clinical veteran, first thought of infectious diseases and asked the couple to call their son for an examination without any symptoms, but the same was true of the lungs on CT.
这一天，还来了一位华南海鲜市场的商户，同是发烧、咳嗽，同样的肺部表现。
On this day, also came a South China seafood market merchant, the same fever, cough, the same lung performance.
湖北省中西医结合医院是离华南海鲜市场最近的两家三级医院之一，它们之间的直线距离不到两公里。
Hubei combined Chinese and Western Medicine Hospital is one of the two level III hospitals nearest to the South China Seafood Market.
“一般来说，一家人来看病只会有一个病人，不会三人同时得一样的病，除非是传染病。
"Normally, a family comes to see only one patient and not three people get the same disease, unless it's an infectious disease.
”张继先在接受《长江日报》采访时介绍，她给这些病人做了甲流、乙流、衣原体、支原体等与流感相关的检查，全部呈阴性，从而排除了流感。
In an interview with the Changjiang Daily, Zhang said she had tested negative for influenza-related illnesses such as influenza A, B, chlamydia and mycoplasma, thus ruling out the flu.
值得一提的是，2003年抗击“非典”时，时年37岁的张继先是江汉区专家组的成员，每天的任务就是下到各个医院排查疑似病例。
It is worth mentioning that in the fight against SARS in 2003, Zhang, then 37 years old, was a member of the Jianghan District Expert Group.
张继先第一时间意识到问题的严重性，12月27日，她把这四个人的情况向业务院长夏文广、医院院感办和医务部作了汇报，医院立即上报给江汉区疾控中心。
Zhang first recognized the seriousness of the problem. On December 27, she reported the situation of the four to the Director of Operations, Xia Wenguang, the hospital hospital office and the Ministry of Medical Affairs.
12月28日、29日两天，门诊又陆陆续续收治了3位同样来自华南海鲜市场的病人，同类病人达到7位。
On December 28 and 29, three patients from the South China seafood market were admitted to the clinic, bringing the total number of patients to seven.
“这是我们从来没有见过的病，来自华南海鲜市场的病人有4个了，这肯定有问题。
"It's something we've never seen before. There are four patients from the South China seafood market, and that must be a problem.
”张继先判断，7个病人症状和肺部表现一致，只是轻重有区别。
Zhang then judged that the seven patients had the same symptoms as the lungs, although the severity was different.
张继先敏锐地意识到情况不对，马上又向医院进行了报告，并建议医院召开多部门会诊。
Zhang Jixian was keenly aware that the situation was not right, and immediately reported to the hospital, and advised the hospital to hold a multi-sectoral consultation.
12月29日下午1时，分管副院长夏文广召集呼吸科、心血管、ICU等部门的十名专家会诊，对这7个病例进行逐一讨论，影像学特殊、全身症状明显、实验室检查肌酶和肝酶都有变化，专家们一致认为，这种情况确实不正常，要引起高度重视。
On 29 December, at 1 p.m., Vice-President Xia Wenguang called a group of 10 specialists from the respiratory, cardiovascular and ICU departments to discuss each of the seven cases on a case-by-case basis.
追问到还有两例类似病患者曾到同济医院、协和医院治疗并且留下的地址也是华南海鲜市场后，夏文广立即决定向上级主管部门汇报。
After cross-examining two similar cases who had been treated in Tongji Hospital, Concorde Hospital and left an address in the South China Seafood Market, Xia Wenguang immediately decided to report to higher authorities.
据《长江日报》报道，接到报告后，省、市卫健委疾控处指示武汉市疾控中心、金银潭医院和江汉区疾控中心前往医院，开始流行病学调查。
After receiving the report, the provincial and municipal health authorities instructed Wuhan CDC, Gold and Silver Pool Hospital and Jianghan CDC to start an epidemiological investigation, Changjiang Daily reported.
1月29日，大年初五，在武汉市汉口长堤街，一群社区医生经过街面。
January 29, about five years, in Wuhan City, Hankou Changti Street, a group of community doctors passed the street.

”一位参与收治病人的医生告诉《中国慈善家》。
A doctor involved in treating patients told China Philanthropists.
12月29日，好几位参与过“非典”救治的医生查看了7位病人，大家都不敢往“非典”上靠，但大家“心里都明白”。
On December 29, several doctors involved in SARS treatment examined seven patients, and none of them dared to rely on SARS, but they "knew it all."
“事情严重了”王敏（化名）是两个孩子的妈妈，作为武汉一家三甲医院感染科的护士长，她已经不记得多长时间没有回家陪孩子了。
"The matter is serious" Wang Min (alias) is the mother of two children, as Wuhan, a triple A hospital infection department head nurse, she did not remember how long did not go home with the children.
自从去年流感高发的12月份开始，不停地有甲流病人涌入医院。
Since December, the month of last year's high flu season, there has been a steady influx of patients with swine flu.
最多的时候，王敏的科室一个晚上收治了二十多名儿童甲流患者。
Most of the time, Wang Min's department admitted more than 20 children A stream patients in one night.
过了半夜还在加班，对她来说已成那段时间的家常便饭，总感觉有“看不完的病人”。
Working overtime after midnight has become the norm for her, and she always feels like a "patient who can't see through."
有时她在值班室里睡上一会，第二天一大早又开始收治病人。
Sometimes she slept in the watch-room for a while, and the next morning she began to treat patients again.
实在太辛苦了，科室里甚至有同事直接辞职不干了。
Really too hard, even a colleague in the department resigned directly.
“整个医院就是在超负荷运行。
"The whole hospital is overloaded.
”王敏告诉《中国慈善家》，12月29日，这一天收治的病人数达到了峰值，王敏的科室一共收治了82名甲流儿童。
Wang told Philanthropists in China that on December 29, the number of patients admitted reached a peak, with Wang's department treating a total of 82 Class A children.
当天中午11点左右，医院领导突然通知医务人员临时开会。
At around 11 p.m. on the same day, the hospital leadership abruptly informed the medical staff to meet temporarily.
在会上，领导并没有说太多信息，只是通知说“下午要开始收不明原因肺炎病人”，需要准备好病房。
At the meeting, the leader did not say too much information, but the notice that "the afternoon to start collecting patients with pneumonia unknown", need to be ready for the ward.
科室负责人李丹（化名）提出反对意见：“这会对八十多名孩子造成严重的威胁。
"This could pose a serious threat to more than 80 children," said Li Dan, head of the department, a pseudonym.
”但最终，收治“不明原因肺炎病人”的决定还是要执行。
But in the end, the decision to treat patients with "unexplained pneumonia" has to be carried out.
“甲流的治疗周期一般是3至5天，我让孩子们能出院的就尽量出院，不能出院的也做好保护。
"I normally discharge my children from hospital within three to five days of treatment, and those who are unable to leave the hospital are protected.
”李丹告诉《中国慈善家》，12月29日，八十多名儿童甲流患者基本上全部出院。
Li Dan told China Philanthropists that on December 29, more than 80 children with swine flu were almost all discharged.
李丹和王敏、还有其他同事一起，组建了一个隔离病区，用于收治其他医院转院过来的7名“不明原因肺炎”患者。
Li, along with Wang Min and other colleagues, set up an isolation ward for seven patients with "unidentified pneumonia" transferred from other hospitals.
当天晚上，他们科室又陆续有了10名同样症状的患者。
Later that night, their department had another 10 patients with the same symptoms.
李丹有数十年的从业经验，经历过2003年非典(SARS)疫情——彼时，这家医院收治的首位非典疑似病人，就是由李丹处理的。
Mr. Li has decades of experience with the SARS epidemic in 2003, when Li Dan handled the hospital's first SARS suspect.
也正是凭借多年的经验和直觉，她做出建立隔离病区的决定。
It was on the basis of years of experience and intuition that she made the decision to create a quarantine zone.
据李丹回忆，12月29日接收的十多名不明原因肺炎患者，其临床表现主要为发热，少数病人呼吸困难，胸片呈双肺浸润性病灶。
Li recalled that on December 29, more than a dozen patients with unexplained pneumonia were presented with fever, breathing difficulties in a few patients, and a two-lung invasive chest biopsy.
按照规定，每到流感高发季节，医院都会慎重处理发热病人。
According to the regulations, every flu season, the hospital will carefully deal with febrile patients.
据官方提供的数据，往年同期，武汉市发热门诊日均就诊人数在3000例左右。
According to official figures, in previous years, the average number of hospital visits per day in Wuhan was about 3,000.
今年疫情发生后，这一数字最高曾爬升到1.5万人。
That number has climbed to as high as 15,000 since the outbreak began this year.
1月29日，湖北省卫健委披露，最高峰时，该省一天内有4万人到发热门诊就诊。
On January 29, the Hubei Wei Jiancommittee revealed that at its peak, 40,000 people a day in the province went to the fever clinic.
1月30日上午9点，34岁的武汉市急救中心120医生王科和他的小组接到任务，将常青花园一位疑似感染新型冠状病毒肺炎的居民转运到医院。
At 9: 00 a.m. on January 30, Dr. Wang Ke and his team, a 34-year-old emergency medical centre in Wuhan, were asked to transfer a resident of Changqing Garden suspected of contracting the new coronavirus pneumonia to a hospital.
摄影/长江日报 金振强但即便是“见多不怪”，12月29日当晚，李丹还是被接连出现十几名不明原因肺炎病人“吓到了”。
Photo / Changjiang Daily Jin Zhenqiang But even if "not surprising," December 29, Li Dan or a dozen patients with unknown causes of pneumonia "scared.
12月30日是星期一，有同样症状来医院就医的病人越来越多了，有些患者甚至出现呼吸困难症状。
On Monday, December 30, an increasing number of patients with the same symptoms came to the hospital for treatment, and some even developed respiratory symptoms.
当天，李丹负责的病区的四十多张床位很快就住满了病人。
On that day, more than 40 beds in Li Dan's sick area were quickly filled with patients.
随后几天，仍有患者源源不断前来就医，李丹感觉到，事情严重了。
In the days that followed, a steady flow of patients continued to arrive for medical treatment, and Lee felt that the matter was serious.
“因为大家对这个病没有认识，病人的情绪也不稳定，那时已经有声音说‘非典’卷土重来，大家心里充满了恐惧感。
"There were already voices saying that SARS was coming back because there was no recognition of the disease and the mood of the patients was unstable," he said.
”李丹回忆。
"Li Dan recalled.
她开始嘱咐医护人员既要保护自己，又要安抚整个病房里病人的心理。
She began to instruct the paramedics to protect themselves and reassure patients throughout the ward.
“连轴转”开始成为医生和护士的工作常态，他们上班不敢喝水，“因为坐下了就不知道什么时候能起身”。
"Twinning" became the norm for doctors and nurses, who were afraid to drink at work "because they sat down and didn't know when to get up."
更糟糕的是，虽然有很多经验，也都做了防护，李丹负责的病区里，还是有护士被感染了。
To make matters worse, despite all the experience and protection, a nurse was infected in the ward where Li Dan was responsible.
“人传人”凭着多年在传染病领域的专业经验，李丹一接触到后来被命名为“新型冠状病毒”引起的病例，就觉得这个病不简单。
"Person-to-person" with years of professional experience in the field of infectious diseases, Li Dan came into contact with the later known as the "new coronavirus" caused by the disease is not simple.
在她的科室里，医务人员一方面加大防护力度，一边采集了这7名病人的支气管肺泡灌洗液，并送往中科院武汉病毒所进行检测。
In her department, medical staff on the one hand increased protection, while collecting the bronchial alveolar lotion of the seven patients, and sent to the Wuhan virus of the Chinese Academy of Sciences for testing.
武汉病毒所与李丹所在的医院有着紧密的合作关系。
Wuhan Virus Institute and Li Dan's hospital have close cooperation.
2019年4月23日，两家单位签署合作研究协议，根据协议，双方在手足口病、艾滋病、流感及上呼吸道感染疾病、结核病等领域开展合作，进一步促进基础与转化医学研究和临床的融合，全面提升双方的科研能力。
On 23 April 2019, the two institutions signed a cooperation research agreement under which they will cooperate in the areas of hand, foot and mouth disease, AIDS, influenza and upper respiratory tract infections, tuberculosis, etc., further promoting the integration of basic and transformational medical research and clinical practice, and enhancing the scientific research capabilities of both sides.
在病房里，防护也提高到了最高级别。
In the ward, the protection was also raised to the highest level.
“那时做的不是一般的防护，而是三级防护。
"What was being done was not general protection, but tertiary protection.
”李丹说。
"said Li Dan.
根据相关规定，医疗防护分为一级、二级、三级。
Medical protection is divided into levels I, II and III in accordance with the relevant regulations.
二级防护要求相关医务人员进入隔离留观室和专门病区必须戴12层以上棉纱口罩，穿工作服、隔离衣、鞋套，戴手套、工作帽，每次接触病人后立即进行手清洗和消毒。
Secondary protection requires the relevant medical personnel to wear a cotton mask of 12 storeys or more, work clothes, protective clothing, shoes, gloves, working cap and hand washing and disinfection immediately after each contact with the patient.
三级防护，适用于为病人实施吸痰、气管切开和气管插管的医务人员，在二级防护基础上，还应当加戴全面型呼吸防护器。
Level-III protection for medical personnel who perform sputum, tracheotomy and trachea intubation for the patient, in addition to secondary protection, full-scale respiratory protection should be added.
“三级防护”属于最高防护级别，几乎全天都被包裹在防护服下，就像整个人闷在一个厚厚的塑料袋里，“隔着N95口罩，不说话就已经开始喘粗气了。
"Level 3" is the highest level of protection and is wrapped almost all day long in protective clothing, like a person in a thick plastic bag. "Through the N95 mask, you start to gasp without speaking.
”1月28日，武汉大学中南医院急救中心的医务人员正在对疑似新型冠状病毒肺炎患者进行救治。
On January 28, medical staff at Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital's emergency center were treating patients suspected to be suffering from a new coronavirus pneumonia.
摄影/《中国慈善家》记者 安源“如果只是一般的传染病，我们怎么会未卜先知地去隔离病人、上三级防护？”在向《中国慈善家》回忆起这段经历的时候，李丹如此反问记者。
Photographer / Chinese philanthropist Anyuan "If it's just a common infectious disease, how can we isolate the sick and protect us from the tertiary level?" Li asked reporters as he recalled the experience to China Philanthropists.
她表示，警觉性一开始就有，对于很多传染病经验丰富的医生来说，他们能从患者的CT影像中一眼就看出问题的严重性。
She says vigilance begins with the fact that many doctors with experience of infectious diseases can see the severity of the problem at a glance in their CT images.
当天，某专科交流群内，发现疑似SARS的消息不胫而走，消息绝非空穴来风。
On the same day, a specialist exchange group, found that suspected SARS news spread, the news is not groundless.
“病人测了是SARS，怎么办？”12月30日，李丹认识的一位做二代测序的同行，发来微信。
"Patient test is SARS, how to do?" December 30, Li Dan knew a second generation of sequencing colleagues, sent a message.
李丹当天向医院领导打电话，汇报情况，电话无人接听，她就在微信留言。
Li Dan the same day to the hospital leadership, debriefed, the phone was not answered, she was in message.
“你又在那儿瞎讲，你不就说的是同济医院那几个病人吗？”李丹后来被领导一顿数落。
"Don't you just talk about the patients at Tongji Hospital?" Li Dan was later scolded by his leader.
“我说的不是同济的病人，是咱们医院的病人。
"I'm not talking about fellow sufferers, I'm talking about patients at our hospital.
”李丹解释说，如果只是同济医院的病人感染了这种奇怪的病，问题可能还没那么大，但其他医院的病人也有类似情况，这绝对能说明存在传染（人传人）现象。
Lee explained that while the problem might not be so great if only patients at Tongji Hospital were infected with the strange disease, patients in other hospitals had similar cases, which is an absolute indicator of the existence of transmission (human-to-human).
不久，武汉同济医院的同行因“造谣传谣”被约谈、处分。
Soon, Wuhan Tongji Hospital colleagues for "rumor rumor" was interviewed, discipline.
李丹隐晦地向专科好友打探，但对方三缄其口，更加让人觉得事情不简单。
Lee Dan vaguely asked a specialist friend, but the other side of the tongue, more people feel that things are not simple.
医院领导让李丹向同行要到“疑似SARS”患者的CT片，看了CT片子后，李丹更是坚定了对“传染性”的判断。
Hospital leaders asked Li Dan to ask his colleagues to go to the "suspected SARS" CT film, after seeing CT, Li Dan is more determined to "infectious" judgment.
回想起来，李丹特别庆幸当初坚决让80多名甲流儿童出院，否则后果不堪设想。
In retrospect, Li Dan is particularly lucky to have resolutely discharged more than 80 A-flow children, otherwise the consequences would be disastrous.
接下来的几天，医院已是人满为患。
For the next few days, the hospital was full.
12月30日，李丹科室的40多个床位全部住满，医院开始拆分其他病区，用于收治肺炎病人。
On December 30, Li Dan's department full of more than 40 beds, the hospital began to split other areas, used to treat patients with pneumonia.
“12月底，我们就已经判断出来，这种传染性的病毒是与华南海鲜市场有关系，因为他们大部分病人之间都相互认识。
"By the end of December, we had concluded that the contagious virus was linked to the South China seafood market because most of their patients knew each other.
有些来就医的病人甚至说，我的亲戚在哪哪住院也快不行了呀。
Some of the patients who came to the hospital even said where my relatives were going to be hospitalized.
他们要么是一个家族，要么就是一起打麻将的人。
They are either a family or they play Mahjong together.
”李丹告诉《中国慈善家》，第一批病人中，有些人要么与华南海鲜市场有直接关系，要么就是住在华南海鲜市场附近，属于聚集性发病。
Li told Philanthropists in China that some of the first patients were either directly related to the South China seafood market or lived near the South China seafood market and were clustered.
“12月底，人传人的迹象已经非常明显，有点常识的人都能判断出来。
"By the end of December, the signs of human-to-human transmission were so obvious that anyone with some common sense could tell.
”李丹说。
"said Li Dan.

Chapter 3: Slow Policy Makers Professionals Analyze that local governments have a responsibility to make information publicly available without declaring an "epidemic" or "epidemic area," and to alert the public and raise awareness of prevention through early warning.
但是这一切并没有发生，甚至匪夷所思地走向反面。
But all this did not happen, even to the contrary.
封口　　就在湖北省中西医结合医院张继先等人将疫情层层上报后，2019年12月30日，肺炎疫情首次进入公众视野。
The case was first reported to the public on December 30, 2019, after Zhang Jishan, the Hubei Province combined Chinese and Western medicine hospital, reported the outbreak.
当日，武汉市卫健委印发《关于做好不明原因肺炎救治工作的紧急通知》，该通知特别强调“未经授权任何单位，个人不得擅自对外发布救治信息”。
On the same day, the Wuhan Health Commission issued an "Emergency Notice Concerning the Treatment of Unknown Causes of Pneumonia," which stressed, inter alia, that "no individual shall, without authorization, release medical treatment information to any other organization."
一位年轻人在微信群里的善意提醒，为“密封”的疫情撕开了一道缺口。
A well-meaning reminder from a young man in a small group has opened a gap in the "sealed" epidemic.
当天傍晚17时43分，33岁的武汉中心医院眼科医生李文亮在一个150人左右的同学群里发布信息称“华南海鲜市场确诊了7例SARS”，他提醒同为临床医生的同学们“让家人、亲人注意防范”。
"Seven cases of SARS were confirmed in the South China seafood market," Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital, told a group of about 150 students at 17: 43 p.m. The South China Seafood Market confirmed seven cases of SARS.
李文亮也由此成为最早向外界发出防护预警的人之一。
As a result, Li Wenliang was one of the first to issue protective warnings to the outside world.
悼念者将李文亮的遗照贴在其生前工作过的院区，前面摆满了鲜花。
The mourners affixed photos of Li Wenliang to the courtyard where he worked before his death, with flowers in front of him.
摄影/《中国慈善家》记者温如军一个群友将他的对话截图发上了网络，而且没有隐去最关键的信息：他的名字和职业。
A group of photographers / Chinese philanthropist Wen Ru Jun posted a screenshot of his conversation online, without losing sight of the key message: his name and profession.
这让看到截图的人轻而易举地找到了李文亮，第二天，他被医院监察科约谈，并要求他写一份对于不实信息外传的反思。
This made it easy for the person who saw the screenshot to find Li Wenliang. The next day, he was interviewed by the Supervision and Inspection Section of the hospital and asked to write a reflection on the transmission of false information.
12月31日，武汉市卫健委发布首个关于该市肺炎疫情的情况通报。
On December 31, Wuhan city health committee issued the first briefing on the pneumonia epidemic in the city.
通报证实，近期部分医疗机构发现接诊的多例肺炎病例与华南海鲜城有关联，目前已发现27例病例，其中7例严重，未发现明显人传人现象，未发现医务人员感染。
The circular confirmed that a number of recent cases of pneumonia found in some medical institutions were linked to Hai Xian City in South China. Twenty-seven cases have been found, seven of which are serious. No significant human-to-human transmission has been observed and no medical staff have been found to have contracted the disease.
该通报还称，经检测分析上述病例系病毒性肺炎，“该病可防可控”。
The notification also said that the detection and analysis of the above cases of viral pneumonia, "preventable controllable."
此时，这一原因不明但“可防可控”的疾病，并未引起公众的重视。
At this time, the cause of this unknown but "preventable controllable" disease, has not attracted public attention.
但是对于一些已经知情的医务人员，他们显然不能理解和接受上述说法。
But for some already informed medical personnel, it is clear that they cannot understand and accept these claims.
然而，除了和同行私下交流这个事情，他们也不敢“声张”。
However, they do not dare to "talk" about it except in private with their peers.
2020年第一天，武汉市公安局官微发布消息称，武汉部分医疗机构接诊了多例肺炎病例，但是有一些网民在不经核实的情况下，就擅自在网络上发布和转发不实消息。
On the first day of 2020, officials of Wuhan Public Security Bureau announced that some medical institutions in Wuhan had received many cases of pneumonia, but some netizens had posted and relayed false information on the Internet without verification.
造成了不良社会影响，公安机关对于8人进行了传唤，并且进行了依法处理。
As a result, the public security organs summoned eight persons and dealt with them in accordance with the law.
当天，武汉市政府还关闭了华南海鲜批发市场。
On the same day, Wuhan city government also closed the South China seafood wholesale market.
风暴中心的华南海鲜市场是当地的大型综合市场，容纳商户1000余户，距离人头攒动的汉口火车站不过800米。

On January 3, Wuhan city health committee issued a second notice: As of 0800 hours on January 3, a total of 44 cases of diagnosis of viral pneumonia with unknown causes had been found in the city, 11 of them seriously.
就在当天上午，李文亮在辖区派出所签下了一份《训诫书》，因“在互联网上发布不实言论”警方对其训诫。
That same morning, Li Wenliang signed a "reprimand" at the district police station, reprimanding him for "publishing false statements on the Internet."
“太寒心了！如果官方刚开始就把情况说清楚的话，百分之五六十的人会做好防护吧。
'Too cold! If the authorities had made it clear at the outset, fifty or sixty per cent would have taken precautions.
”武汉协和医院的医生林羽曾对《中国新闻周刊》回忆，疫情刚开始的时候，武汉市的策略都是“冷处理”。
Lin Yu, a doctor at Wuhan Concorde Hospital, recalled to China News Weekly that when the outbreak first started, Wuhan's strategy was "cold-dealing."
他所在的医院就通知，在没有单位授权的时候，不允许私自在公众平台谈论病情，不允许私自接受媒体采访，不仅仅是临床系统，包括院办、CDC那边消息管控更严重，“整个就不让说”。
His hospital told them not to talk about their illness on public platforms or allow private interviews with the media without authorization from the organization, not just the clinical system, including hospitals and CDC, where the control of information is more serious.
当时，医生们唯一能做的就是一再嘱咐就诊患者：“口罩、口罩，一定要买口罩、戴口罩”。
At the time, the only thing doctors could do was repeatedly order patients to see a doctor: "masks, masks, must buy masks, wearing masks."
他们甚至半开玩笑地嘱咐大家，“不要去华南海鲜市场买东西，那里东西不新鲜。
They even told everyone, half-jokingly, "Don't go shopping at the seafood market in South China, it's not fresh.
”　　封城　　在1月5日发出的第三则通报中，武汉市卫健委的结论依然是“未发现明确的人传人证据，未发现医务人员感染。
In the third circular, issued on January 5, Wuhan Health Commission concluded that "no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission has been found and no cases of infection by medical personnel have been found."

直至11日武汉市两会闭幕，武汉市卫健委未发布关于不明原因肺炎的疫情通报。
Until the end of Wuhan City two sessions on the 11th, Wuhan City Health Commission has not issued an outbreak of unknown causes of pneumonia.
直到1月14日，武汉卫健委才在第七则通报中将“未见明显的人传人”变为“不排除有限人传人”。
It was not until January 14 that Wuhan Wei Bodyguard Commission changed the phrase "no discernible person-to-person" to "do not rule out limited human-to-human transmission" in the seventh circular.

”他还表示：“直到后来，特别是元月20日，国务院召开常务会议，确定了该病作为乙类传染病，并进行甲类传染病管理，而且要求属地负责，我们的工作就主动多了，在很多方面采取一些强硬措施，不是慢半拍，可以说是硬了一拍。
"Until then, especially on January 20, the State Council held an executive meeting and determined that the disease was a Class B infectious disease and was under Category A infectious disease management, and demanded territorial responsibility.
”两天后的1月29日，国家卫健委高级别专家组成员、中国疾病预防控制中心流行病学首席科学家曾光接受《环球时报》采访时回应了武汉疫情应对是否“缓慢”问题。
Two days later, on January 29, Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist at the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a member of the national health committee's high-level panel, answered the question of whether the response to the Wuhan epidemic was "slow."
他表示，武汉此次面对疫情行动有些慢，主要是科学认识的问题，但也不排除一些决策上的犹豫、对自己是不是自信。
Wuhan, he said, faced with the epidemic some slow action, mainly scientific understanding of the problem, but also do not rule out some decision-making hesitation, is not self-confidence.
机制北京大学法学院教授、博士生导师王锡锌对《中国慈善家》表示，疫情的发布是一种非常特殊的政府信息的主动公开，公开的主体的确是国务院和国家卫生行政部门。
The release of the outbreak is a very special kind of government information initiative, the main body is indeed the State Council and the state health administration departments, Wang Xizin, a professor at Peking University Law School and a doctoral supervisor, told China Philanthropists.
从权限上，在没有得到授权的情况下，武汉市政府确实不能发布疫情，但当地政府有责任在不宣布“疫情”或“疫区”的情况下，将已获得的信息公开，并且通过预警的方式让民众有所警惕，提高防范的意识。
In terms of authority, the Wuhan government can't issue an epidemic without authorization, but the local government has a responsibility to make the information available to the public without declaring an "epidemic" or "epidemic area," and to alert the public and raise awareness of prevention by way of early warning.
梳理近两个月的疫情发展史，无论是去年12月的那段空白期，还是今年1月5日起不定期发布的武汉市卫健委官方通报，都找不到与“预警”相关的表述。
No statement related to "early warning" can be found in the history of the epidemic over the past two months, be it the gap period in December last year or the unofficial notice issued by the Wuhan Health Commission since January 5 this year.
国际公共卫生专家、美国加州大学洛杉矶分校（UCLA）公共卫生学院副院长张作风在接受《中国慈善家》专访时表示，在这次疫情暴发的早期，政府部门防控的步子比较慢、措施没有跟上，有一个延缓的过程，是造成全国疫情大爆发的主要原因之一。
In an interview with Chinese Philanthropists, Zhang style, an international public health expert and vice-dean of the UCLA School of Public Health, said that in the early days of the outbreak, government departments were slow to control and slow to catch up.
张作风同时认为，这次疫情应对的过程也充分暴露了中国公共卫生体系的诸多缺陷，包括公共卫生人才的缺乏、很多的措施没有及时跟上、一些政府部门对公共卫生预防医学不重视等等。
Zhang also said the epidemic's handling of the epidemic has exposed a number of shortcomings in China's public health system, including a shortage of public health personnel, delays in many measures, and a lack of attention by some government departments to preventive medicine in public health.
其不良影响也是显而易见的，比如在疫情的初始阶段没有充分利用公共卫生流行病学、预防医学的专家来指导防疫，这就是一个很大的欠缺。
The adverse effects are also evident, as in the initial stages of the epidemic, when experts in public health epidemiology and preventive medicine were not fully utilized to guide the epidemic, which is a major deficiency.
他进一步深入分析指出，由于政府和管理部门平时对预防医学、公共卫生重视不够，投入不够，国家和省市疾控中心失去了许多优秀的流行病学家和公共卫生专家。
He further in-depth analysis pointed out that due to the government and management of preventive medicine, public health, insufficient attention and investment, the national and provincial CDC lost many excellent epidemiologists and public health experts.
“公共卫生和预防医学的职责是预防疾病发生或者把传染病控制在暴发最早期。
"The role of public health and preventive medicine is to prevent disease or to control infectious diseases at the earliest stage of an outbreak.
但是，疾控中心和从事公共卫生的单位不盈利，所以造成收入低，在社会上不受尊重，有一些地区已经取消疾控中心，或者合并到医院。
However, CDC and public health units are not profitable, resulting in low income and low social esteem, with some areas having abolished CDC or merged with hospitals.
同时, 预防医学公共卫生的学生得不到足够的重视，很多学生毕业后学不致用，导致疾控系统后继无人。
At the same time, the preventive medicine public health students do not receive enough attention, many students after graduation will not be used, leading to disease control system.
”张作风呼吁，通过这次疾病暴发流行的控制过程，希望国家高度重视公共卫生和疾病控制系统，并且加强投入，完善从中央到地方的疾病控制系统和公共卫生学院。
Zhang style called for the country to give high priority to public health and disease control systems through the outbreak's control process and to invest more in improving disease control systems and public health colleges from the central to the local level.
“希望这次新冠肺炎的暴发给领导者敲响警钟，开始注意公共安全事业，打造召之即来、战之能胜的强大疾病预防控制队伍。
"Hopefully, this outbreak of pneumonia is a wake-up call for leaders to take note of public safety and build a strong disease prevention and control force that can be called in and win the battle."
”旅居新加坡的资深媒体人于晓东对《中国慈善家》表示，新加坡是中国以外新冠病毒感染最严重的国家，该国政府在防控新冠病毒方面的措施对中国一定的启示和借鉴意义。
Singapore is the most heavily infected country outside China, and the government's efforts to prevent and control the new crown virus have some implications for China, Yu Xiaodong, a senior media official in Singapore, told China Philanthropists.
“新加坡政府长久以来在国际上被认为是技术专家治国政体（technocracy）的典范。
"The Singapore government has long been recognized internationally as a model of technocracy.
所谓技术专家治国，指的是由在技术上拥有高水平的专家来决定政策，其特点是在决策中将政治和意识形态的考虑因素最小化，强调科学技术和专业知识的主导地位，其不同于西方民主制以民选代表为核心的决策机制，也不同于权力集中的传统威权体制。
The so-called technocratic governance refers to the decision-making by technically qualified experts, characterized by the minimization of political and ideological considerations in decision-making and the emphasis on the primacy of science, technology and expertise, as distinct from the decision-making mechanisms of Western democracies centred on elected representatives and the traditional authoritarian system of centralization of power.
”于晓东介绍。
"Mr. Yu said.
根据他的观察，自新冠疫情在新加坡出现以来，政府的反应基本上符合技术专家治国的路线。
According to his observations, since the outbreak of the New Crown in Singapore, the government's response has been largely technocratic.
“新加坡出现第一个新冠病毒确诊病例是在1月23日，他是一名从广州飞到新加坡的武汉游客。
"The first confirmed case of the new crown virus in Singapore came on January 23 when he flew from Guangzhou to Singapore as a tourist.
就在同一天，武汉宣布封城，新加坡政府立刻在机场设立了体温检测等措施，将体温异常的中国游客进行隔离。
The same day, Wuhan announced the closure of the city, the Singapore government immediately set up temperature testing and other measures at the airport to isolate Chinese tourists with abnormal body temperature.
到了1月27日，新加坡的确诊病例达到7例，全部都是来自武汉的游客，新加坡政府随即将疫情预警级别定为第三级的黄色。
By January 27, the number of confirmed cases in Singapore had reached seven, all tourists from Wuhan, and the government immediately set the disease alert level at level three yellow.
到了2月3日，新加坡出现了首起在本地感染的病例，政府随即将疫情警戒级别调高至黄色；在2月7日出现数例群聚感染病例之后，再将警戒级别调高到橙色。
By February 3, Singapore had its first case of local infection, and the government raised the alert level to yellow. The alert level was raised to orange after several cases of mass infection on February 7.
”据介绍，新加坡的防疫预案简称DORSCON，是在SARS病毒之后的2005年由新加坡卫生部主导制定的，在2009年的H1N1流感疫情中首次启动，最近一次更新是在2014年。
Singapore's pandemic preparedness plan, or DORSCON, was developed in 2005 under the leadership of the Ministry of Health of Singapore after the SARS virus and was first launched in 2009 with the H1N1 flu pandemic, the latest update in 2014, the agency said.
根据这个预案，疫情来临时的危机管理系统由一个以内政部长为主席的部长联席会议来提供战略和政治指导，并由作为内政部最高级别官员的常任秘书作为危机应对执行小组的组长。
Under this scenario, the crisis management system in the event of an outbreak would be strategically and politically directed by a joint meeting of ministers, chaired by the Minister of the Interior, with the Permanent Secretary, as the highest-ranking official of the Ministry of the Interior, as Chair of the Crisis Response Implementation Team.
“这个预案很详细地对相关情况下的防御措施、政府跨部门协调、出入境控制、公众交流、应急物资采购等方面的应对措施做了说明。
"The plan describes in great detail the response to situations such as defense measures, cross-government co-ordination, immigration control, public communication, emergency supplies procurement, etc.
内容涉及组织早期治疗、采取降低病毒传播和减低对卫生系统冲击的措施，并对如何保护医疗人员、确保基本社会服务，以及商业的延续性做出了相应的规定。
It covers the organization of early treatment, the adoption of measures to reduce the spread of the virus and the impact on the health system, and the corresponding provisions for the protection of medical personnel, ensuring basic social services and the continuity of business.
预案对疫情出现时的隔离、治疗、接触隔离、探访、甚至尸体处置也做出了指导性安排。
The plan also provides guidance on quarantine, treatment, contact isolation, visits and even the disposal of corpses in the event of an outbreak.
”于晓东认为，在中、新两国各自的制度和应对措施下，最终都能控制住这次新冠疫情。
Mr Yu believes that the new crown could eventually be brought under control by the respective regimes and responses of the two countries.
对中国来说，尊重科学在决策中的应有地位应该是当下中国社会团结一心的最大公约数。
For China, respect for science's rightful place in decision-making should be the largest common denominator of Chinese society's unity.
