疫情是一面镜子，对每一个个体亦是如此，它照出了一些人的高尚与伟大，也照出了一些人的卑劣与渺小。
The epidemic is a mirror, to every individual, it reflects the nobility and greatness of some, but also the meanness and smallness of some.
记者| 吴　雪2月15日，新民周刊刊发了《快递小哥解决金银潭医护难题：我送的不是快递，是救命的人啊。
REFUGEE & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45
》一文，引发社会广泛反响，人民日报、央视新闻等主流媒体纷纷转发，新民周刊也第一时间开通了捐赠物资对接通道，目前已经为武汉前线对接了1.5万余件捐赠的医疗物资。
The newspaper, CCTV News and other mainstream media have relayed the text, and Xinmin Weekly has opened a channel for the docking of donated materials at the first time.
在全国人民携手抗疫的大背景下，我们感动于这位80后普通快递小哥的挺身而出，更感动于每一个普通人、平凡人为抗疫所做出的不平凡的努力。
In the background of the people all over the country to fight against the epidemic, we moved by the post-80 common courier brother to step forward, but also moved every ordinary, ordinary people to fight against the epidemic made extraordinary efforts.
然而，就在昨天（2月25日），一篇题为《他，撑起了武汉最后的门面》的文章在朋友圈刷屏，文章通篇讲述了快递小哥汪勇的故事，获赞、评论无数，阅读数也很快到了10w+。
However, just yesterday, Feb. 25, an article entitled "He Propped Up the Last Facade of Wuhan" was painted on a screen by friends. The article told the story of Wang Yong, the express-delivery brother, and won praise, numerous reviews and a quick reading of 10w +.
汪勇看到这篇文章时，正在跟踪捐赠给医院的一批物资，开始他并没有在意，但印象中，他并未接受过这位自媒体作者“林孤小姐”的采访。
When Wang Yong read the article, he was tracking a shipment donated to the hospital. He didn't care at first, but was under the impression that he had not been interviewed by the media writer, Miss Lin Gu.
林孤小姐在未采访汪勇情况下，发布了《他，撑起了武汉最后的体面》中午一点钟，汪勇通过公众号里的商务合作菜单联系上林孤时，得知这篇文章，并非她本人采写，也从未与当事人汪勇联系过，而是根据本刊微信公众号以及央视新媒体稿件编造洗稿而成，并在叙述表达时加入了诸多作者个人的臆想。
In the absence of an interview with Wang Yong, issued "He, the last up Wuhan decent" at 1 noon, Wang Yong through the public number of business cooperation menu contact Lin Ling, learned that this article, not her own written, and never contact Wang Yong, but based on this print Wei Xin public and CCTV news media manuscripts, and added many authors' personal imagination to the narrative.
“许多内容都不属实，表达上和评论回复里也存在故意煽动读者情绪，我觉得很不妥。
"Much of the content is untrue and there is a deliberate attempt to stir up the reader's mood in expressions and comments, which I find inappropriate."
”汪勇通读了文章，向对方指出了表达上存在的一系列问题，那时，作者设置了文末打赏按钮，打赏人数只有几百人。
"Wang Yong read through the text and pointed out a series of problems with expression, when the author set up a" prize "button for hundreds of people.
汪勇指出：第一，“林孤小姐”写道：“汪勇看到金银潭医院医生的求助信息：‘有没有顺风车送我们回家’后，汪勇接下了这个单子。
First, "Miss Lin Gu" wrote: "Wang Yong saw the help message from the doctor at the gold and silver pool hospital: 'Is there a lift home with the wind' and Wang Yong took the list
”汪勇说，当时自己并非顺风车司机，而是开着自己的私家车，义务接送医护人员，因此，并不存在“接单”一说，个人也从未收取过任何人的钱。
Wang Yong said he was not a windmill driver at the time, but drove his own private car to transport medical staff on a voluntary basis, so there was no "pick-up order" and no one had ever received money from an individual.
汪勇截图指出“林孤小姐”报道失实　图｜汪勇供图第二，“林孤小姐”描述：“车队人数，迅速扩展到30人。
Wang Yong screenshot pointed out that Miss Lin Gu's report was inaccurate, Wang Yong was second, and Miss Lin Gu's description: "The number of people in the convoy rapidly expanded to 30.
”该数字未经核实，并非迅速扩展为30人，而是前后总共30人左右，最多时接送医护人员也不过5-6个人。
The unverified figure does not expand rapidly to 30, but to a total of about 30, with up to five to six paramedics being transported.
第三，“林孤小姐”称：“汪勇的盒饭供给量，已经是一个庞大的数字了，每天要提供盒饭15000多份。
Third, "Miss Lin Gu" said: "Wang Yong's boxed rice supply, has been a huge number, to provide more than 15,000 boxes of rice every day.
”汪勇说，对方未向他本人核实，自己并未负担过每天1.5万份的餐，而是武汉一家本地企业“today便利店”牵头爱心企业一并提供的。
Wang Yong said the other party had not personally verified that he had not borne 15,000 meals a day, but had done so in conjunction with a caring business led by Wuhan-based Today Convenience Store.
汪勇截图指出“林孤小姐”报道失实　受访者供图汪勇与作者“林孤小姐”对话　受访者供图汪勇说，和“林孤小姐”联系的最初目的是看看能否更改文中“表述失实”之处，并建议作者写作时尽量不要带有个人情绪，希望给大家带去正能量。
The first purpose of contacting Miss Lin Gu-yong was to see if he could change the "misrepresentation" of the text. He suggested that the writer should try to avoid personal feelings and bring positive energy to the audience.
“当时对方答应得很好，但到了晚上12点我看她还没修改，而且文末的打赏已经到了2059个人，我觉得这件事情不对了。
"It was a good promise, but by 12 p.m. I didn't think she had changed it, and the reward at the end was 2,059, and I didn't think it was right.
”汪勇告诉《新民周刊》，简单算一笔账，打赏按钮中有最低5块—200块的金额，如果按照2000人打赏为基数，那么所得金额将是最低1万块，最高40万的钱数，还不算“其他金额”这一选项。
Wang told Xinmin Weekly that there was a minimum of five to two hundred dollars in the reward button, and that if the reward was based on 2,000 people, it would be a minimum of 10,000 yuan and a maximum of 400,000, not counting the "other amount.
“林孤小姐”公众号的打赏页面汪勇告诉《新民周刊》，他并不清楚这个打赏的用途，他有一个简单的想法，既然作者并未对他进行过采访，又用他的故事和影响力来宣传和获取打赏，他担心善款是否就能够用在前线医护人员身上。
Wang Yong, the "Miss Lin Gu" public comment page, told Xinmin Weekly that he did not know what the reward was for. He had a simple idea that since the author had not interviewed him and used his stories and influence to promote and obtain rewards, he was worried that the money would be used on front-line medical staff.
但汪勇在与林孤小姐沟通后，对方给到的回复是：“打赏并非募捐，每一篇原创文章，都有赞赏功能，这不是捐款，而是赞赏，是针对文字创作者也就是林孤小姐自己的鼓励。
But Wang Yong in the communication with Miss Lin Gu, the other side of the response is: "Reward is not fundraising, every original article, there is appreciation of the function, not donations, but appreciation, is the author of the text, that is, Miss Lin Gu's own encouragement.
”汪勇很无奈，提出了自己的建议：第一，公示所得钱款，第二，将钱款花在任何医院或者医护人员身上均可，不希望别人认为是他或者他的朋友依靠此事而赚了钱。
"Wang Yong was helpless, put forward his own proposal: first, to make public money, second, to spend money on any hospital or medical personnel, do not want others to think that he or his friends rely on the matter to make money.
“我不知道她会写这篇文章，更不知道下面会有人打赏。
"I didn't know she was going to write this article, much less that there was going to be a reward.
”林孤小姐与汪勇微信对话受访者供图但“林孤小姐”一再强调通过发布未经核实的文章进行打赏，并无任何不妥。
Lin Gu and Wang Yong Weixin interviewed for the interview but "Miss Lin Gu" repeatedly stressed that there was nothing wrong with offering rewards through unverified articles.
几番沟通无果后，凌晨00：32，汪勇在朋友圈转发了该文并发布严正声明:“该文章未对我进行采访，与作者不认识，且素材也非我提供，后面有2000多人打赏也与本人无关，未发起任何募捐及打赏，特此声明。
After several unsuccessful attempts at communication, Wang Yong forwarded the article to his friends at 00: 32 a.m. and issued a solemn declaration: "I have not been interviewed, I do not know the author, and the material is not provided by me.
”林孤小姐与汪勇微信对话　受访者供图2月26日凌晨，汪勇在朋友圈发表声明声明发出后，今天凌晨1点钟，作者“林孤小姐”迫于压力删除了该文。
In the early morning hours of February 26, after Wang Yong issued a statement in the circle of friends, the writer "Miss Lin Gu" was pressured to delete the article.
《新民周刊》记者在“林孤小姐”公众号看到，该公众号一共发表原创文章313篇，每一篇下面均有打赏按钮，除了汪勇故事这篇，笔者大概统计了下发表在近期的几篇文章，武汉街头流浪者、限制韩国人入境以及监狱风云等，打赏人数均未超过30人，最高时打赏也不过100人。
According to the magazine, the magazine published 313 original articles, each with a "hit button." Some recent articles, such as those on the streets of Wuhan, restrictions on the entry of South Koreans, and prison conditions, show no more than 30 visitors and no more than 100 at the highest level.
而对方也承接相关广告业务，在商务合作一栏，她要求品牌谈合作时，注明品牌和合作方式，具体标价不明。
And the other side also undertake related advertising business, in the business cooperation column, she asked the brand to talk about cooperation, brand and cooperation, the specific price is unknown.
“林孤小姐”微信公众号打赏页面“林孤小姐”微信公众号商务合作页面汪勇告诉《新民周刊》，事实上，自己根本没有精力管这件事，他想把宝贵的时间放在帮助医护人员这些重要的事情上。
"Miss Lin Gu" micro-letter to the public page "Miss Lin Gu" micro-letter public business cooperation page Wang Yong told Xinmin Weekly, in fact, he has no energy to deal with this matter, he would like to devote precious time to help medical staff these important things.
虽然自打2月23日返回工作岗位，但一线的工作并没有停止，对接物资、解决难题、许多应急事件的处理，仍然非常需要他。
Although he returned to work on 23 February, work on the ground has not stopped and there is still a great need for him to dock supplies, solve problems and deal with many emergency incidents.
最近几天，他越来越忙了，因为武汉管控升级，许多小区三天只让居民出来一次，很多志愿者出不来，导致许多支援事件停滞不前。
In recent days, he has become increasingly busy, as Wuhan has upgraded its controls, allowing residents to come out only once every three days in many neighborhoods. Many volunteers have been unable to get out, causing many support incidents to stall.
汪勇在对接一批捐赠物资　受访者供图而他对志愿者的招募也不再局限于“必须一个人住”、“严格遵循消毒流程”，而是必须要有共同的价值观。
Wang Yong is offering a collection of donor respondents, and his recruitment of volunteers is no longer limited to "living alone" and "strictly following disinfection procedures," but must share common values.
相比之下，靠着汪勇事件的影响力洗稿敛财的“林孤小姐”是否应该好好反省？截至目前，全国派出了380多支医疗队、4.2万余名白衣天使奋战在一线；方舱医院、火神山医院、雷神山医院，昼夜灯火通明，只为患者赢得一线生机。
So far, more than 380 medical teams and more than 42,000 white-clad angels have fought on the frontlines, and the Fang, Fo Shen and Lui Shenshan hospitals have all lit up around the clock to earn a living for their patients.
医护人员在靠椅上短暂小憩　受访者供图静安区三星居民区的社区工作者周荣为了保证小区居民健康、天天上门排查、测温，连鞋底都磨破了；武汉同济医院的后勤人员李师傅，只要需要，即便在凌晨一两点也会爬起来做消杀工作；蓝天救援队机动车队队长许鹏，为了第一时间将物资送达医院，连夜开车到山东拉货，不幸遭遇车祸付出了年轻的生命。
To ensure the health of residents, daily house-to-door inspection and temperature measurement, Zhou Rong, a community worker in the Samsung neighbourhood of Tongji District, Wuhan Tongji Hospital, will climb up to do disinfection work even at 1-2 a. m. if necessary.
你看，在祖国各地，每一个“汪勇们”都在拼了命地保障一线、救治患者，期待着武汉重启，期待着2020春天的到来。
You see, in all parts of the motherland, every "Wang Yong" in the fight to protect the first line, save patients, waiting for Wuhan to restart, looking forward to the arrival of spring 2020.
反观这位“林孤小姐”，作为自媒体作者，不仅没有利用庞大的流量做善事，反而变相敛财。
Looking at the "Miss Lin Gu", as a self-media writer, not only did not take advantage of the huge amount of traffic to do good deeds, but disguised enrichment.
这让笔者不禁想起了一件事，快递小哥汪勇事件报道后，广州越秀区农林下路小学五年级三班小学生孙盟鸥，写下了一篇《读后感》，他说：“汪勇是一名再普通不过的中国人，但他却是我们的榜样，我们少先队员也应该做一些力所能及的事，我让妈妈找到了汪勇的微信号，捐出了我的压岁钱。
"Wang Yong is an ordinary Chinese, but he is our role model. Our Young Pioneers should do something we can," he said. "I got Wang Yong's message and donated my lucky money.
”广州越秀区农林下路小学五年级三班小学生孙盟鸥连一个五年级小学生都懂得的道理，为什么一个拥有独立认知的成年作者，却置若罔闻？我们当然不可能要求所有人的价值观都一样，但至少，不能洗稿、更不能传播虚假消息应该是自媒体的底线。
Why does Sun Yingou, a primary school pupil in Grade 5, in Yuexiu District, Guangzhou, understand why an adult author with independent cognition turns a deaf ear to it? Of course, we cannot demand the same values for all, but at least it is the bottom line from the media that you cannot write, let alone spread, false information.
显然这些基本的要求，“林孤小姐”都没有做到。
Obviously, these basic requirements, "Miss Lin Gu" did not do.
疫情是一面镜子，对每一个个体亦是如此，它照出了一些人的高尚与伟大，也照出了一些人的卑劣与渺小。
The epidemic is a mirror, to every individual, it reflects the nobility and greatness of some, but also the meanness and smallness of some.
汪勇对“林孤小姐”这样的事情很是失望，但是，“汪勇们”还不能停下脚步，因为疫情未走，春天还未到来。
Wang Yong "Miss Lin Gu" such things are very disappointed, but, "Wang Yong" can not stop, because the epidemic has not gone, spring has not yet come.
