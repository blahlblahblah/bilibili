和你我一样，他们是通过手机、电视关注着这个叫新型冠状病毒的疾病，在家祈祷着疫情赶紧过去。
Like you and I, they are watching this disease called the new coronavirus on their cell phones and television, praying for the outbreak to pass quickly at home.
但整个社会又是一个有机体，每个企业、每个家庭、每个人都是这其中的一个个小小细胞。
But society as a whole is an organism, in which every enterprise, every family and every individual is a small cell.
牵一发动全身，即使身体仍健康，他们也都与这场疫情有了丝丝缕缕的联系。
Even though they are still healthy, they are all inextricably linked to the epidemic.
从餐饮到旅游，从制造业到进出口，企业经营压力正在显现。
From catering to tourism, from manufacturing to imports and exports, business pressures are emerging.
2月2日晚间，苏州市率先公布了帮扶中小企业共渡难关的十条政策，为他们加大金融支持、稳定职工队伍、减轻负担。
On the night of February 2, Suzhou took the lead in publishing 10 policies to help small and medium-sized enterprises tide over difficulties together, increasing financial support, stabilizing the workforce and lightening the burden.
上海、北京等地亦跟进，出台新规救扶企业。
Shanghai, Beijing and other places also follow up with the introduction of new regulations to help enterprises.
银行业也在行动：针对受疫情影响较大的批发零售、住宿餐饮、物流运输、文化旅游等行业，多家银行表示不抽贷、不断贷、不压贷；对湖北省内普惠性小微企业、个体工商户和私营企业主经营性贷款，在现有利率基础上下调0.5个百分点。
The banking sector is also taking action: in wholesale, retail, accommodation, logistics and cultural tourism industries, which are more affected by the epidemic, a number of banks have indicated that they do not lend, lend, or lend under pressure.
在这个最特殊的开年，不煽情也不批判，不盲目乐观也不过分悲观，我们听听这些中小企业创业者的所见所闻、所思所感，他们与这场疫情的真实“对抗”。
In this most special year, do not stir up emotions and criticism, do not blindly optimistic not too pessimistic, we listen to these SME entrepreneurs, what they think and see, they are the real "confrontation" with the epidemic.
令人鼓舞的是，尽管现在大家或多或少有些损失，但他们都能理解并坦然接受，也都在积极寻求出路。
It is encouraging to note that, while everyone is now more or less at a loss, they all understand and accept it and are actively looking for a way out.
安全第一，“创业者总得乐观一些”。
Safety first, "entrepreneurs always have to be optimistic."
徐鸿飞，上海，鲜蛋产业25年300万只鸡眼看要断粮，各机构紧急支援鸿轩生态农业养殖场我是1996年到上海，在国营蛋品企业做销售；2001年出来创业，创立了徐鸿飞小鲜蛋，到现在创业快20年了，一直做鲜蛋产业。
I went to Shanghai in 1996 to work as a salesman in a state-run egg enterprise. In 2001, I started my own business, founded Xu Hongfei's eggs, and has been doing the fresh egg industry for nearly 20 years.
我们公司（江苏鸿轩生态农业有限公司）营销总部在上海，生产总部在南通；因为是上海市第一批民生必备物资生产企业，正月初六就被允许复工了。
Our company, Hongxuan Ecological Agriculture Co. Ltd., is headquartered in Shanghai, and its production headquarters is in Nantong.
2月1号，我们往武汉送了14.4万个鲜蛋，9万个捐给武汉协和医院，5.4万个捐给武汉科技大学附属天佑医院。
On February 1, we sent 144,000 fresh eggs to Wuhan, 90,000 to Wuhan Concorde Hospital, and 54,000 to Tian You Hospital, affiliated with Wuhan University of Science and Technology.
今天（2月3号）正好我过生日，我们夫妻俩两大家人商量着说就算了，今年就别聚餐了，各自在视频问候了一下。
Today (February 3) coincided with my birthday, we both agreed to talk about it, this year do not have dinner, each in the video greetings.
我在这行25年了，今年是第一年遇到有钱也买不到货的情况。
I've been in this business for 25 years, and this is the first year I've had money and I can't buy anything.
以往不管是碰到什么行情，或是一些疫病，都不会影响到上游玉米、豆粕的供给。
In the past, no matter what market encountered, or some disease, will not affect the upstream corn, soybean meal supply.
我们是养殖行业，每天都是需要饲料的，现在即使你有钱，货物流也成问题。
We are a livestock industry that needs fodder every day, and even if you have money now, the flow of goods is questionable.
举个例子，我们河北、河南的玉米供应商，很积极地把车开到自己家仓库里，结果村委会拦住不准发车。
For example, our corn suppliers in Hebei and Henan actively drove their cars into their own warehouses and the village committee stopped them from leaving.
饲料对我们是硬需求，我们本来已经算是准备充足的了，备了半个月的饲料，从腊月二十六到正月初十的，仓库当时爆满了。
Feed to us is hard demand, we have been ready to be sufficient, prepared for half a month feed, from the twenty-sixth to the first 10 months of January, the warehouse was full.
在南通，我们有300万只鸡，每天消耗300吨饲料，到现在（2月3日）只剩两天的库存了，几乎就要空仓了。
In Nantong, where we have 3 million chickens and consume 300 tons of feed a day, we have only two days left in stock (February 3), almost empty.
每天每只鸡需要105克饲料，这是雷打不动的。
Each chicken needs 105 grams of fodder a day, which is not worth beating.
所以我们面临的情况就是打仗一样，要想办法多搞饲料，几百万只鸡一旦饿肚子，就麻烦了。
So the situation we face is the same as war, to find ways to do more feed, millions of chickens, once hungry, trouble.
给它饿一两天，产蛋效率马上从现在的90%（100只鸡里90只产蛋）锐减为70%，而且蛋鸡身体恢复要三个月。
Give it a day or two of hunger and the efficiency of egg production drops sharply from 90% today (90 out of 100 chickens) to 70%, and it takes 3 months for the eggshell to recover.
断粮十天八天它死不了，但是鸡体损伤了，就很难恢复了。
Ten days without food It won't die, But the chicken's damaged, And it's hard to recover.
我们昨天（2月2日）紧急开会协调，上海光明集团帮忙，从上海粮食和物资储备局调配一些玉米和豆粕，估计能撑几天。
We had an emergency meeting yesterday (Feb. 2) to co-ordinate an estimated few days of corn and soybean meal from the Shanghai Grain and Materials Reserve with the help of Shanghai's Guangming Group.
江苏省农发行也在帮忙，给我们寻找可以用的玉米供应商；河南、河北也通过当地农业办公厅在协调。
Jiangsu Agricultural Distribution is also helping us find viable corn suppliers; Henan and Hebei are also coordinating through local agricultural offices.
还有就是资金流的问题，我们也非常着急，业务款回款基本要等到2月9号上班以后。
There is also the issue of financial flows, we are also very anxious, the operational funds will not be until February 9 after work.
我们是年销售额近20亿的企业，一个月不回款就是一两个亿现金，春节前还买了一大批饲料，没有回款，账上储备现金不够的。
We are the annual sales of nearly 2 billion enterprises, a month without cash is one or two billion dollars, Spring Festival before the purchase of a large number of fodder, do not pay back, insufficient cash reserves on the account.
真没意料到节后会这么长时间不能回款。
I didn't expect to be able to pay you back for so long.
这些天各方也都在协调，像上海市政府、南通市政府。
These days all sides are also coordinating, like the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Nantong Municipal Government.
我们这边应该政府比较开明，金融办、发改委等部门帮忙，像车辆绿色通道证件很快办下来。
Our side should be more open-minded government, the Financial Office, the Development and Reform Commission and other departments to help, such as the green passage vehicles quickly down.
很期待各地出台防疫期间的信贷扶持政策，我也仔细研究了苏州出台的10条政策，其实作为民营企业来说，一个共识的诉求是减免税收。
I look forward to the introduction of vaccination during the credit support policy, I also carefully studied Suzhou issued 10 policies, in fact, as a private enterprises, a consensus demand is tax relief.
（备注：“苏十条”其中第八条就是减免中小企业税费。
(Note: "Ten Rules" Article 8 is to exempt or exempt SMEs from taxes and fees.
规定：因疫情原因，导致企业发生重大损失，正常生产经营活动受到重大影响，缴纳房产税、城镇土地使用税确有困难的，可申请房产税、城镇土地使用税困难减免。
Regulations: As a result of the epidemic situation, enterprises have suffered major losses, normal production and operation activities have been seriously affected, and if it is really difficult to pay property tax and urban land use tax, they may apply for housing property tax and urban land use tax relief.
）下游鸡蛋销售我不担心，没有受到什么影响，超市卖场的销售还提升了50%以上。
) I wasn't worried about the sales of eggs downstream, which rose by more than 50 percent.
现在鸡蛋批发价格比放假之前跌了50%，从4.5块/公斤，跌到2.4-2.5块/公斤。
Wholesale egg prices are now down 50 per cent from their pre-holiday level, from 4.5 / kg to 2.4-2.5 / kg.
这种批发价下滑是短期的，因为学校、工厂什么的还没开学、开工，后面鸡蛋价格应该会迅速上涨。
This wholesale price decline is short-term, because schools, factories and so on have not opened, start work, the price of eggs should rise rapidly behind.
除了我们捐赠给武汉几家医院，现在当地好多医院也给我们发了函，要求援助，之前那里的鸡肉、鸡蛋供应严重不够。
In addition to our donation to several hospitals in Wuhan, many local hospitals have now sent us letters asking for help.
我们计划捐助100万个鲜蛋。
We plan to donate one million fresh eggs.
接下来吧，期盼疫情尽快稳定，同时，让民生物资流动起来。
Next, look forward to stabilization of the epidemic as soon as possible, while allowing the flow of people's goods.
老徐，广州，二房东号召租户，推迟返工，一起熬过14天大概5年前，经老乡介绍，我来到了广州天河区城中村，成为一名二房东。
Xu, Guangzhou, the second landlord called on tenants, delayed rework, together withstood 14 days about 5 years ago, after the villagers introduced, I came to Guangzhou Tianhe District Cheng Zhongcun, became a landlord.
广州是一座很包容的城市，城市村就像海绵一样，容纳了大量的外来务工人口。
Guangzhou is a very tolerant city, the city village is like a sponge, accommodating a large number of migrant workers.
我这边的租户形形色色，有做淘宝生意的、有在餐饮店打工的，有在公司上班的小白领、也有一家老小一起租住的。
My side of the tenants are a variety of Taobao business, some in the restaurant, some small white-collar work in the company, there are old and small rental together.
因为城中村距离市区近，周围有超市、商场、地铁的配套，所以基本上每个月可以出租95%以上的房间。
Because it is close to the city and surrounded by supermarkets, shopping malls and subways, it is basically possible to rent more than 95 per cent of the rooms each month.
二房东的工作，就是从广州本地房东手中盘下房子，每个月给房东交固定房租，我再把房间分租出去，进行统一管理，赚取中间的差价。
Second, the landlord's job is to take the house from the local landlord in Guangzhou, pay a fixed monthly rent to the landlord, I sub-rent the room, unified management, earn the middle difference.
一般而言，我的房租出租率要达到90%以上才能保本，所以整体风险还是非常大的。
In general, I rent rental rate to reach more than 90% to protect the capital, so the overall risk is very large.
2020年，新型冠状病毒肺炎突然爆发，武汉很快就实施了封城。
In 2020, the new coronavirus pneumonia suddenly broke out, Wuhan soon implemented the closure of the city.
初期，我并不担心，临近春节，广州人有逛花市的习惯，距离我的楼不远处的大街上，经常有花商摆摊位卖花，形成一个临时的花市。
At the beginning, I did not worry, near the Spring Festival, Guangzhou people have the habit of hanging flowers, not far from my building on the street, often florist stalls to sell flowers, forming a temporary flower market.
人流密度很大，但是大家基本都不戴口罩。
There is a high density of people, but most of them don't wear masks.
过完除夕，我感觉情况不太对了，新闻报道中的感染人数越来越多，广州的案例数也在明显增加。
After New Year's Eve, I feel the situation is not right, the number of infected people in the news reports is increasing, the number of cases in Guangzhou is also increasing significantly.
不久，政府就号召大家居家隔离，企业推迟开工时间。
Soon after, the government called for people to stay in their homes and businesses to delay the start of construction.
按照往年的情况，大年初七左右，我这边的租客基本上都应该返穗了。
According to the previous year's situation, about seven years ago, my side of the tenant should basically return to the ear.
这次，大家因为隔离要求、担心感染等原因，回来的人数很少。
This time, people because of quarantine requirements, fear of infection, and so on, the number of people back.
到初十左右，大概只回来了20多家租户。
Around the tenth day of junior high, only about 20 tenants have returned.
这几天，我每天都会戴着口罩守在门厅，让租户做好登记注册，提醒他们一定要戴口罩，一定要勤洗手！基本上，年轻人的自我防护意识都比较强，但是老年人还是不行。
These days, I wear a mask in the foyer every day to let tenants register and remind them to wear masks and wash their hands frequently! Basically, young people are more aware of self-protection, but the elderly still can't.
我已经提醒一位婆婆好几次要戴口罩，但是这位婆婆说超市、药店都买不到口罩，她也没办法。
I have reminded a mother-in-law several times to wear a mask, but the mother-in-law said the supermarket, pharmacies can not buy masks, she can not do.
我现在特别担心电梯会发生传染，因为Sars期间好像就有电梯间感染的案例。
I'm particularly worried about elevator infections right now, because Sars seems to have had a few cases of elevator infection.
我每隔两个小时都会向电梯间喷84消毒液消毒。
I spray disinfectant 84 on the elevator every two hours.
本来年前，我还买了75%浓度的酒精，但是电商显示“受国家假期政策调整及交通管控影响，订单略有延迟”，一直收不到货。
I also bought 75% alcohol a year ago, but electrical vendors showed "a slight delay in receiving orders due to changes in the national holiday policy and traffic regulations."
现在只能希望电商能够赶紧发货，我把电梯更加彻底消毒一下。
Now I can only hope that the electrician can deliver the goods quickly, I will more thoroughly disinfect the elevator.
新闻里面说要减少人和人的直接接触，我想外卖和快递也是隐患，于是赶紧找了一个闲置的柜子，放在门口，要求所有外卖和快递小哥都放在这个柜子里，不要进入楼里，增加感染风险。
I thought takeaway and express delivery were also hidden dangers. So I quickly found an empty cupboard and left it at the door, where I asked all delivery and courier brothers not to enter the building, increasing the risk of infection.
最近几天，有租户微信问我，能不能减免租金，我想了很久，最后只能在朋友圈说“对于大家的要求，我真的无能为力”，还加了三个大哭的表情包。
In recent days, a tenant asked me if I could get a rent reduction. I thought for a long time and ended up saying, "There's nothing I can do about it." I added three crying bags.
这个问题真的是无解的难题，在我这个小生意里，涉及到的三方：本地房东、二手房东、租客，大家都很难。
The problem is really an unsolvable one. In my small business, the three parties involved: the local landlord, the second-hand owner, the tenant, we are all very difficult.
首先是租客，大多数是外地的，因为疫情大家推迟春节返城，收入可能减少，所以有些人希望能够减免部分房租。
The first is renters, most of whom are from outside the country, because the epidemic is delaying the Spring Festival return to the city and income may be reduced, so some people want to be able to reduce some rent relief.
其次是房东，很多本地房东其实是贷款建这些出租屋的，每个月都要向银行还贷。
Secondly, the landlord, many local landlords are actually loans to build these rental housing, every month to the bank to repay the loan.
我这边租金交不上去，本地房东的贷款也还不上。
I can't pay the rent here, and the local landlord's loan is not up yet.
最后我也很难。
I had a hard time in the end.
我每个月都要给房东交一大笔房租。
I have to pay a large rent to the landlord every month.
因为春节原因，我1月份的房租还没收齐，随着疫情的发展，感觉2月份的房租也有点悬。
My January rent was confiscated because of the Spring Festival, and I felt the February rent was a bit overhang as the epidemic unfolded.
我的中间利润其实很薄弱，如果真的减租，那么只能自己承担亏损。
My middle profit is actually very weak, if the real rent reduction, then have to bear their own losses.
老徐在朋友圈发的图片我其实很担心租户大量回来，人一多，感染的几率就大。
Xu in the circle of friends sent pictures I am really worried about a large number of tenants back, a large number of people, the risk of infection is high.
现在我每天都在朋友圈里面号召租户，响应政府要求，能不出门就不出门，能推迟返工就推迟返工。
I now call for tenants in my circle of friends every day, responding to government requests to stay in the house and postpone rework until rework is delayed.
电视里面说，这种病毒的潜伏期是14天，我想把这14天熬过去就好了。
The incubation period of the virus is 14 days. I want to get through this 14 days, television said.
我现在经常对自己说，心态放轻松，不要总是搞的那么紧张，只要努力保证大家健康，现在的情况总会过去的。
Now I often say to myself, relaxed attitude, not always so nervous, as long as we strive to ensure the health of everyone, the present situation will pass.
志超，重庆人，创业3个月教开源节流的课更火爆，我准备找工作了我是1990年的，刚刚创业。
Zhichao, Chongqing, 3 months to start a business to teach more thrift classes, I am ready to find a job I was in 1990, just started a business.
我现在在重庆，很不幸的是我们小区有被确诊的了，整个小区全部管控，在家不敢出门了。
I am now in Chongqing, very unfortunately our community has been diagnosed, the entire area of control, do not dare to go out.
疫情打乱了我所有的安排，现在我突然觉得在公司上着班、有一份稳定工作挺好的。
The epidemic has disrupted all my plans, and now I suddenly feel that it is good to work in the company and have a stable job.
比如今天（2月3日）是我前公司开工的第一天，做游戏直播的公司，他们日子很好过的。
Today (February 3), for example, was the first day my former company started, the company that broadcast the game live, and they were fine.
我现在的心情……就感觉自己一手好牌打烂了。
I am now in the mood... I feel like my hand is broken.
我后来算了一下，大概今年犯太岁了，哈哈。
I calculate later, make a year probably too old, haha.
这次是我第一次创业。
This is my first time to start a business.
毕业后，我回了老家重庆，在地方媒体呆过一阵子；后来因为女朋友在广州，就也去了广州，那是2014年年底，之后一直在移动互联网公司做事。
After graduation, I went back to my hometown of Chongqing and stayed in the local media for a while. Later I went to Guangzhou because my girlfriend was in Guangzhou.
我有几年是在做直播， 2019年下半年的时候，我跟一些前辈聊，他们说做教育很有前途。
I've been broadcasting live for a few years, and in the second half of 2019, I talked to some of my predecessors, who said that education was promising.
这其中线上教育挺痛苦、赚不到钱，我们就商量着一起做线下培训，把线上流量导到线下变现。
This online education is painful, do not earn money, we discuss together do offline training, online traffic to realize.
告诉你，那些培训公司很赚钱的，随随便便的上两天课就刷个五六万块。
I'm telling you, the training companies are very profitable, paying half a million bucks for a casual two-day course.
我2019年国庆节提了离职，年终奖也没要。
I quit on the 2019 National Day and didn't get a year-end bonus.
本来是该有十四薪的。
It was supposed to be fourteen dollars.
之后，我们几个人合伙人一起研发课程，也找好了渠道合作方，计划春节后就开课。
After that, several of our partners together to develop the curriculum, also found a good channel partner, planning to start classes after the Spring Festival.
结果这几天渠道合作方给我们反馈，“大家半年内都别想这事了”。
Result these days channel cooperator gives us feedback, "everybody does not think about this matter for half a year."
我最大的庆幸是没有招一堆人、租大办公室，那样的话我们肯定完蛋了。
I'm glad we didn't hire a bunch of people to rent the big office, which would be the end of us.
我们的课程内容是关于怎么做营销的，销售对象主要是企业老板，他们带着团队来听。
Our course content is about how to do marketing, the sales target is mainly business owners, they bring the team to listen.
但目前最大的问题是（发生疫情后）他们都很焦虑，不会要听我们的课程的，我们是教别人如何花了钱之后，赚更多钱。
But the biggest problem right now is that [after the outbreak] they're anxious not to listen to our lessons. We're teaching people how to spend money and make more money.
有一家同行的课程现在异常火爆，他们是讲如何开源节流的……我和合伙人商量，先把这个项目搁置吧，等经济回暖了再启动。
One of my peers is having an unusually hot class. They're talking about cutting corners... I'll talk to my partners and put the project on hold until the economy warms up.
说实在话，没有让我亏进去更多的钱，我已经很庆幸了。
Indeed, I am grateful that I have not been deprived of any more money.
现在，我准备重新找工作了。
Now I'm ready to start looking for a new job.
这三个月创业是我人生的插曲，回想起来，经历也是难忘和值得总结的。
These three months of entrepreneurship is an episode in my life, in retrospect, the experience is memorable and worth summing up.
廖沙，北京，贸易我计划好了，现在要做三件事我是哈尔滨人，现在在北京，留学回国以后就创业了；主要做贸易，组装美容仪器出口，公司叫MBT Laser。
Now I am from Harbin. Now I am in Beijing and I have started my own business after returning from studying abroad. I mainly trade, assemble beauty apparatus for export, and my company is MBT Laser.
上个星期开始，物流不能走货了。
Since last week, logistics can not be shipped.
我发往俄罗斯的一批货滞留在路上或者海关，对我来说，这情况突如其来。
A shipment I sent to Russia was stranded on the road or at customs, and this came as a surprise to me.
我们做国际贸易，每年90%的利润都来自俄罗斯市场。
We do international trade, and 90% of our annual profits come from the Russian market.
现在，客户汇款什么的可以，但就是货物发不出去了。
Now, customers can send money or something, but the goods can not be issued.
我在莫斯科和圣彼得堡有仓库，我把库存都发给客户了。
I have warehouses in Moscow and St. Petersburg, and I have distributed them to customers.
往常我们交货周期是7天左右，现在至少一个半月。
Normally our delivery cycle is about 7 days, now at least a month and a half.
我们跟俄罗斯对接的大市场叫留布里诺，虽然算是在欧洲，但是里面有很多咱们东北人、浙江人在做生意，还有中东人，那里货物、仓储、零售全在一起。
The big market we have with Russia is Leubrino, though in Europe, but there are a lot of us in the Northeast, Zhejiang doing business, and the Middle East, where goods, storage, and retail are all in one place.
我现在天天跟俄罗斯朋友视频。
I now video with my Russian friends every day.
留布里诺市场你知道吗？那边都开始抢口罩了。
You know what, the Leubrino market? They're starting to steal masks over there.
我问俄罗斯的朋友能不能买到口罩，结果他说我还想从中国买点儿呢。
I asked my Russian friend if he could buy a mask and he said I wanted to buy some more from China.
今天（2月2日）早上五六点，我跟乌克兰的哥们聊天，他说有口罩，一下子发来好几种型号，还有防毒面具。
Today, Feb. 2, at 5: 00 a.m., I was talking to a Ukrainian buddy who said he had masks, sent in several models at once, and gas masks.
他说找到一两千口罩没什么问题，立马让他下单了，是3M比N95还高一个级别的口罩。
He said there was nothing wrong with finding one or two thousand masks, and immediately asked him to order a 3M mask one level higher than N95.
三天前他打开电脑看到的口罩价格是1.2美金，我们聊完那会儿就变成2.4美金了，翻了一倍。
The price of the mask he saw on his computer three days ago was $1.20, and by the time we finished, it had doubled to $2.40.
我准备自己留一点儿，给同事、朋友都分一分。
I'm going to save a little for myself and give each of my colleagues and friends a point.
我们公司在这边是十多个人，我算了下，折合每天的硬性成本支出是10万左右。
Our company here is more than a dozen people, I calculated that the daily cost of hard costs is about 100,000.
没算房租，因为房租我是直接年付的。
I don't calculate the rent, because I pay it directly.
具体就是，社保我得给按时交，销售和科研人员的工资都不低， 1600多平米工厂的各种支出。
In particular, I have to pay social security on time, sales and scientific research personnel are not low, 1600 square meters of various expenses.
别的不说，就这个工业用网络，一年20万、加一个主机（费用）。
Not to mention this industrial network, 200,000 a year, plus a host (cost).
反正耽误一个月是真“流血”。
A month's delay is really "bleeding."
间接损失呢，就是公司员工会担心这个市场会如何变化。
Indirect losses are those in which employees worry about how the market will change.
咱小微企业10来个人，一年就这么点业绩，抗风险能力特别差，包括资金上、供应链上。
We micro and small enterprises 10 people, a year on such a performance, particularly poor risk resistance, including on the financial, supply chain.
我的同行比我更困难，有些四五十号人的公司，别说停一两个月，你就停一天，他脑袋都疼！以前我们是纯贸易公司，2019年年中筹划着，开始陆陆续续小规模生产了，到2020年布局好了，人员、技术也配备上了，产品也定型了，马上就要开整、准备大干一场。
Some companies of forty or fifty, let alone a month or two, stop for a day or two, and his head aches! We used to be a pure trading company, planning to start small-scale production in mid-2019, then layout by 2020, personnel and technology, product stereotypes, soon to be ready to start a full-scale, ready to do.
但现在，我们都在等整个产业链的重新开工、运作。
But now, we are all waiting for the entire industrial chain to restart, operation.
我们出口型中小企业，真是顶着风冒着雨。
We export small and medium-sized enterprises, the wind is really braving the rain.
去年公司营业额挺可观，但到我们小业主手里不算多。
Last year the turnover of the company is quite considerable, but to our small business owners is not much.
还好，国家也支持，给退税，不同种类的商品、出口到不同的国家，有不同的税务补贴政策，我们这里在6%-7%左右，差不多能抵个增值税。
Fortunately, the state also supports tax rebates, different kinds of goods, exports to different countries, different tax subsidy policies, we here around 6% to 7%, almost can be worth VAT.
好在我还没有贷款，是用自己的钱扩产的。
Fortunately, I did not have a loan, is to use their own money to expand the production.
我计划好了，现在要做三件事。
I have a plan. Three things to do now.
第一，我们继续谈业务，通过网络办公，只是咱把交货时间跟客户说清楚。
First, we continue to talk about business, through the network office, but we just let the customer know the time of delivery.
你能等我一两个月，我给你打折，咱们两好并一好（互惠互利）。
You can wait for me for a month or two, I'll give you a discount, and we'll be fine.

我是一个连续创业者，之前在教育行业做，最近一年在福建本地做一个酱香型白酒品牌。
I am a continuous entrepreneur, before doing in the education industry, the last year in Fujian to do a soy sauce-based liquor brand.
之前我花了大概一年时间，走遍了茅台镇附近好几十家酒厂，联合当地酿酒商一起合伙创立了“如匠”这个品牌。
It took me about a year to travel through dozens of wineries around Maotai, and to work with local brewers to create the brand of Masons.
合伙人世代酿酒，技术很成熟，我要做的事情是拓展销售渠道和做品牌营销。
The partner generation brews wine, the technology is very mature, I want to do is to expand sales channels and do brand marketing.
刚刚发布两个月，如匠就卖了1000多万的流水，从第一天开始就有利润。
Just two months after it was released, the craftsman sold more than 10 million dollars in running water, making a profit from the first day.
自福建龙岩起家，我希望2020年把如匠扩展到全省，销售额做到3个亿。
From Longyan, Fujian Province, I hope to expand such a craftsman to the province by 2020, sales of 300 million.
但现在，肺炎疫情给我的计划造成了很大影响。

幸好之前我还拿了两笔上千万的融资，能撑一阵子。

春节本来是酒类的消费高峰，第一个人们串门要送礼，第二个春节有聚会，大家多少会喝点。
Spring Festival is originally the peak of alcohol consumption, the first people to visit to send gifts, the second Spring Festival has a party, we will drink more or less.
疫情一来，这两块儿基本都没有了。
With the outbreak of the disease, these two pieces are basically gone.
之前，为了抓住春节的商机，我们提前制作了一批礼盒，把酒和酒具配在一起，礼盒单价是五百多块钱，总值五六百万。
Before, in order to seize the business opportunity of the Spring Festival, we made a batch of gift boxes ahead of time. The price of gift boxes was over five hundred yuan, worth five or six million yuan.
在年前，有一部分礼盒已经给到经销商渠道了，我们不做赊销，经销商拿货给现款，但他们手里的货没消化出去，会影响后续进货的节奏。
A few years ago, some gift boxes were given to dealers, we do not do credit sales, dealers take cash, but their hands do not digest the goods, will affect the pace of incoming goods.
我们现在还剩两百多万的货在自己手里，得后边再消化。

我这次创业，从第一个月开始就在挣钱，净利润过百万。

如果没受到疫情的影响，至少得挣个两三百万。
If not affected by the epidemic, at least two or three million dollars would have been earned.
我手下的人也都要9号之后才上班，整个2月上旬也基本浪费掉了。
My people didn't start work until after the 9th, and the whole of early February was largely wasted.
接下来工作重点是拓展经销渠道，得去跟经销商面对面聊、沟通。
The next focus of the work is to expand distribution channels, have to go face-to-face with dealers, communication.
因为是酱香型的酒，客单价稍高一点，没有100元以下的酒，大家还得倚赖线下渠道。
Because it is the soy sauce type wine, the guest unit price is a little higher, there is no less than 100 yuan of wine, we still have to rely on the offline channel.
现在如匠线上和线下渠道的比大概在2:8。
Now the ratio between the line and the offline channel is about 2: 8.
本来，为了拓展线下渠道，我们还计划举办更多活动，发布会、品酒会之类的，但现在都没法做。
We were planning more events, conferences, tasting sessions and the like to expand our offline channels, but we can't do that right now.
有些钱注定要打水漂了。

我们在一些要扩展的地方开了分店，预计年后开业，现在开不了业，物业成本得付吧。

还有年前定下要开发布会的场地，广告投放，都是钱。

业务拓展比较快，我本来计划年前招人的，当时没来得及，这为我省了一笔钱。
Business expansion is faster, I had planned to hire people years ago, before it was too late, which saved me a sum of money.
创业者遇到这样的状况，当然很不开心，但也没办法，及时调整吧。
Entrepreneurs encounter such a situation, of course, very unhappy, but there is no way, timely adjustment bar.
想一想，所有行业的人都要面对这个问题，也不是只有我们一家。
Think about it. We're not the only one facing this problem in all industries.
还好创立企业不久，我就已经拿了两轮上千万的融资。
Fortunately, it wasn't long before I started a business, and I had two million rounds of financing.
疫情即使暂时不好转，我也有信心把企业继续运转下去，至少得再撑一年。
Even if the epidemic does not improve for the time being, I am confident that the business will continue to operate, at least for another year.
新闻上讲，那些比较有良心的房东，也会适当减少业主的房租。
News that the more conscientious landlords, will also be appropriate to reduce the rent owners.
我们也会对经销商的目标任务做出调整，给他们减负。
