About 1471 words This article is expected to read 4 minutes Zhongqing Pao Wuhan Front Reporting Group Wang Jiaxing New Year's Day, the reporter came to Wuhan Fifth Hospital out-patient hall.
接近中午12点，大厅里还排着多条长队，有的患者坐在自带的塑料小板凳上排队，所有的人都带着口罩。
Toward twelve o'clock noon, there were long queues in the hall, some patients on their plastic stools, all wearing masks.
大厅里人虽然多，但很安静。
There were many people in the hall but it was quiet.
为避免交叉感染，大多数患者都是一个人来看病。
To avoid cross-infection, most patients come to see a doctor alone.
一名患者称，自己早上7点到医院，排到11点才看上医生，医生开具了CT单后，又等了两个来小时，“等着做CT的名单才减少一半”。
One patient reported that he arrived at the hospital at 7 a.m. and did not see the doctor until 11: 00. The doctor drew up a CT list and waited for another two hours before "the waiting list was halved."
一名刚做完CT的患者告诉记者，他的家人是前一天夜里来排的队。
One patient, who had just finished his CT scan, told reporters that his family had been on a platoon the night before.
“防护用具全部用完，请求支援！”“医生不敢吃饭上厕所，因为没有多的防护服了”……除夕夜，多条有关武汉市第五医院医疗资源紧张的图片和视频在社交上传播。
"The doctor dare not eat to go to the toilet, because there is no more protective clothing..." On New Year's Eve, many pictures and videos about the lack of medical resources in Wuhan Fifth Hospital spread socially.
那么真实情况究竟是什么样的？在第五医院，记者从多名正在工作的医生和护士处了解到，医院库存的防护用品确实非常紧张。
At the Fifth Hospital, reporters learned from doctors and nurses who were working that hospital stocks of protective equipment were indeed tight.
因为防护服是一次性的，脱下后就无法再使用，医护人员大多减少饮水、推迟就餐时间，尽可能延长防护服的使用时间。
Since protective clothing is disposable, it can no longer be used after taking off, the majority of medical personnel to reduce drinking water, delay eating time, as long as possible to use protective clothing.
记者之前从武汉市的同济医院、协和医院、市中心医院的医务人员处了解到，自1月23日起，各家医院的防护用具和消毒用具开始告急，若不及时补充，将在4天内耗尽。
Medical staff at Wuhan Tongji Hospital, Concorde Hospital and City Centre Hospital have been alerted to the emergency of protective and disinfectant supplies in hospitals since 23 January, which will be exhausted within four days if not replaced in a timely manner.

At noon today, the reporter again contacted the medical staff, previously interviewed said that they have received materials from the Government and various sectors of society.
记者了解到，自1月22日起，武汉市第五医院等7家医院已经按上级部署，被确定为武汉市中心城区发热患者定点收治医院，全部用于接诊发热患者。
The reporter understands that since January 22, Wuhan City Hospital No. 5 and other seven hospitals have been deployed as superiors, identified as Wuhan downtown fever patients designated hospital, all used for the treatment of fever patients.

武汉市第五医院的一名护士称，被确定为定点医院后起，本就人满为患的医院“更挤了”。
A nurse at Wuhan's Fifth Hospital said the already overcrowded hospital was "even more crowded" after being identified as a designated hospital.
记者多方了解发现，61家发热门诊医疗机构已有部分停开发热门诊。
Reporters have found that 61 out-patient heating out-patient facilities have partially stopped the development of thermal clinics.
其中一家医院的医生告诉记者，因大量医护人员支援其他医院，医院不仅发热门诊停开，连普通门诊和急诊也只能停开。
Doctors at one of the hospitals told reporters that the hospital was closed not only for fever clinics but also for general outpatient and emergency cases because of the large number of medical staff supporting other hospitals.
类似的情况也出现在同属发热患者定点收治医院的武汉市中心医院、武汉市第九医院等医院。
A similar situation also occurred in Wuhan Central Hospital, Wuhan Ninth Hospital and other hospitals, which were also designated hospitals for patients with fever.
1月23日，在武汉市第九医院，排队的患者一直排队到发热门诊大厅外面，医院不得不打起遮雨棚；武汉市中心医院则在大厅摆出告示牌，提示患者等待就诊时长，最长的超过5个小时。
At Wuhan's Ninth Hospital on January 23, patients queued up outside the hot clinic hall and hospitals had to put up shelters, while Wuhan Central Hospital put up signs in the lobby reminding patients to wait longer than five hours.
在武汉市第五医院，前来就诊的患者往往要经过这样的流程：先在门诊部门口测量体温，经医生诊断后，做血常规检查、胸部CT诊断。
In Wuhan Fifth Hospital, patients often go through this process: first in the outpatient department temperature measurement, after the doctor's diagnosis, blood routine examination, chest CT diagnosis.

还有一名患者称，自己此前在武汉市第五医院确诊患有新型冠状病毒引起的肺炎，但医院因其症状较轻没有收治，现在自己发高烧，要求医院收治，护士安慰称会尽力安排，不过反复提示“医院床位很紧张”。
