本报记者 陈婷 曹学平 广州报道1月24日，正值除夕。
This reporter Chen Ting Cao Xueping Guangzhou reported January 24, the New Year's Eve.
在这个本该全家团圆吃年夜饭的日子，对于正在武汉市金银潭医院接受治疗的新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎患者王伟（化名）来说，今晚将与观察病房中的其他三位病友一起度过。
Wang Wei, an alias, will spend the night with three other patients in the observation ward as the family reunites for the Lunar New Year dinner.
王伟对《中国经营报》记者说，除夕夜没能跟家人一起度过觉得有些许遗憾，但是从长远来看，还是觉得这样做有必要，毕竟回家之后若是使家人感染上病毒，自己也会非常后悔。
Wang told China Business News that it was a bit of a shame not to be able to spend New Year's Eve with his family, but in the long run, he felt the need to do so.
此外，因为担心同在武汉的姐姐王燕（化名）的个人安全，王伟今天没让姐姐给自己送饭。
In addition, fearing for the personal safety of his sister Wang Yan (not her real name) in Wuhan, Wang Wei did not ask his sister to bring him rice today.
晚餐吃的是医院提供的盒饭，菜品有莴苣炒胡萝卜、鹌鹑蛋炒木耳、煎鱼排、炖鱼块、炆豆腐等。
For dinner, he was served a packed lunch of lettuce fried carrots, partridge eggs stir-fried fungus, fried fish fillets, stewed fish, stewed tofu, etc.
照片均由受访者提供王伟今年44岁，其生病前在武汉华南海鲜批发市场一家经营带鱼、黄鱼、鱿鱼等海鲜冻品的档口打工，每天凌晨4点钟上班，傍晚5点下班，主要工作是搬运冻品。
Before his illness, Wang Wei, 44, worked at a seafood stall in Wuhan South China Wholesale Seafood Market, selling frozen seafood such as fish, yellow fish and squid. He works at 4: 00 a.m. and 5: 00 p.m. everyday.
王燕此前告诉记者，王伟于2019年12月31日下午两点从华中科技大学同济医学院附属同济医院（以下简称“同济医院”）转入武汉市金银潭医院，入住该院住院部南四楼。
Wang told reporters that Wang Wei was transferred from Tongji Hospital (Tongji Hospital) of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology at 2: 00 p.m. on December 31, 2019.
王伟大概在2019年12月16日或17日开始出现发烧症状，在家里“挺了8天”之后，因持续高烧约40摄氏度才住进了武汉市第六医院。
Wang, who developed fever on December 16 or 17, 2019, was admitted to Wuhan Sixth Hospital after spending eight days at home with a high fever of about 40 degrees Celsius.
彼时，王伟在武汉市第六医院以及同济医院住院治疗时，王燕还能一直在王伟身边进行照顾，直至王伟戴着呼吸机转院到武汉市金银潭医院，由于院方对病人和家属进行隔离，王燕就再也没见过弟弟，王伟也开始了独自一人照顾自己的治病时光。
When Wang Wei was hospitalized at Wuhan Sixth Hospital and Tongji Hospital, Wang Yan was able to keep an eye on Wang Wei until he was transferred to the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital in Wuhan wearing a ventilator. As the hospital separated the patients and their families, Wang Yan never saw his younger brother again.

”王燕和弟弟王伟一家是东北人，在武汉落地扎根了20余年。
Wang Yan and his younger brother, Wang Wei's family, were from the northeast and landed in Wuhan for more than 20 years.
王伟和妻子育有一子，也在武汉打工，但没有同住一个屋檐下。
Wang Wei and his wife had a son who also worked in Wuhan, but did not live under the same roof.
王燕说，侄子在王伟生病前很少给王伟打电话，自从王伟生病住院后，便开始天天给王伟打电话。
Wang Yan said his nephew rarely called Wang Wei before he was ill. Since Wang Wei was ill in hospital, he has been calling Wang Wei every day.
王伟曾对王燕说：“摊上这个事也值了，起码儿子懂事多啦！知道关心爸爸了。
Wang Wei once said to Wang Yan: "Stalls on this matter also worth, at least the son has a lot of understanding! Know to care about father.

1月24日，王伟告诉记者，今晚就只准备在病房里观看春晚节目，与家人进行视频通话。
