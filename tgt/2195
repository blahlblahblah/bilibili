科学家在最短时间内破译了新冠病毒“密码”，“解药”也逐渐浮现，疫苗进入动物试验阶段。
Scientists broke the new cap virus "code" in the shortest possible time, "antidote" gradually emerged, the vaccine entered the animal test phase.
但病毒从哪儿来、谁是“零号病人”，还有太多未知需要时间找到答案。
But there are still too many unknowns about where the virus comes from and who is "patient zero" and it will take time to find out.

疫情暴发至今，全球科学家正全力拼凑新型冠状病毒的拼图。
So far, scientists around the world have been trying to piece together a new coronavirus puzzle.
测定病毒全基因组序列、提取病毒毒株，科学家在最短时间内破译了新冠病毒的解锁密码。
In the shortest time, scientists decipher the unlocked cipher of the new crown virus by measuring the whole genome sequence of virus and extracting virus strains.
新冠肺炎的“解药”也逐渐浮现，疫苗进入动物试验阶段。
The new crown pneumonia "antidote" also emerged gradually, the vaccine enters the animal experimental stage.
从实验室到病床前，曙光初现。
Dawn dawns from the laboratory to the hospital bed.
但病毒从何而来、谁是第一个被感染的“零号病人”，还有太多未知和争议，需要时间找到答案。
But where the virus came from, and who was the first infected "patient zero," is far too much to know and debate, and it will take time to find out.
━━━━━病毒突袭未知病毒出现在2019。
-- R.H. Raider The unknown virus appears in 2019.
直到今天，躺在武汉金银潭医院病床上的林华（化名）还不知道，自己缘何被病毒偷袭。
Until today, lying in Wuhan gold and silver pool hospital bed Lin Hua (alias) do not know, why he was attacked by the virus.
她只记得，症状最早出现在12月，憋气、咳嗽、身上没力，体温高高低低。
She only remembered that the first symptoms appeared in December, suffocating, coughing, body strength, body temperature high and low.
这是病毒在她体内作祟。
It's the virus inside her.
在它击垮林华之前，已突破了她身体的三道防线：先是穿透由皮肤、黏膜和分泌物构成的物理屏障，随后绕过了日常“巡逻”可以发现并“吃掉”入侵病毒的吞噬细胞，继而挣脱免疫细胞的阻挡。
Before it destroyed Lin, it had broken through three lines of defense: first, through a physical barrier of skin, mucous membranes, and secretions, then past the usual "patrol" to spot and "eat" invading phagocytes and then break free of immune cells.
最终，它通过识别位于肺部上皮细胞表面的ACE2蛋白——这个新冠病毒入侵人体的“门把手”，病毒通过刺突蛋白（S蛋白）抓住它，进而打开进入细胞的大门——进入人体细胞，利用细胞的能量让自己繁殖。
Ultimately, it identifies the ACE2 protein located on the surface of lung epithelial cells - the "doorknob" of the new crown virus that invades the human body. The virus then grabs it through a spike protein (S protein), which opens the door to cells - cells that use their energy to reproduce themselves.
病毒像寄生虫，从不满足于在一个感染者身上停留，它想攀附尽可能多的宿主。
The virus, like a parasite, is never satisfied with staying on an infected person. It wants to cling to as many hosts as possible.
一个喷嚏、一次近距离交谈，病毒就可以从一个人传递给另一个人，再到一群人，在这样的几何级疯狂复制中以求生存。
A sneeze, a close conversation, the virus can pass from one person to another, and then a group of people, in such a geometric frantic reproduction to survive.
现有流行病学调查表明，至少在去年12月中旬，这样的病毒人际传播就已发生。
Existing epidemiological surveys indicate that such human-to-human transmission of the virus occurred at least in mid-December.
但在当时，危险无人察觉。
But at the time, the danger went unnoticed.
三个、五个、十个……直到感染者相继发病，走进医院。
Three, five, ten... until the infection one after another, into the hospital.
发热、咳嗽、“大白肺”，患者症状不同寻常又彼此相似，这引起湖北省中西医结合医院医生张继先的警觉。
Fever, cough, "large white lung," the patient's symptoms are unusual and similar to each other, which caused Hubei Province combined with Western medicine doctor Zhang Jixian vigilance.
在连续接诊多位患者后，她在12月底“拉响警报”。
She "sounded the alarm" at the end of December after receiving multiple visits.
━━━━━捕捉病原体在2019年最后一天，未知病毒以“不明原因肺炎”进入大众视野的同时，科研人员开始尝试破译病毒的基因数据。
Streams in the Desert (May 19, 2019) As unknown viruses enter the public domain with "pneumonia for unknown reasons," researchers are trying to decipher the virus's genetic data.
病毒基因组，是病毒的生命密码。
The virus genome is the virus's code for life.
借助于分子生物技术，病原学专家通过对病毒感染者的鼻咽拭子、支气管肺泡灌洗液等标本进行测定，可以在短时间内获得病毒的基因组序列。
With the help of molecular biology technology, pathogen experts can obtain the genome sequence of virus in a short time by measuring samples such as swabs of nose and pharynx and bronchial alveolar lavage.
这样的破译，最早在2020年1月2日就已完成。
Such a decipher would have been completed as early as 2 January 2020.
1月2日中午12点，中国疾控中心病毒所第一次接收湖北省疾控中心送检的4例武汉不明原因病毒性肺炎疫情病例标本。
At 12 noon on January 2, the China CDC Virus Institute received for the first time four samples of cases of unexplained viral pneumonia in Wuhan sent for inspection by the CDC in Hubei Province.
在这之前，远在上海的科研团队比中国疾控中心更早拿到了标本。
Prior to that, research teams in Shanghai had access to specimens earlier than the China CDC.
2019年12月26日，上海市公共卫生临床中心收集到武汉市中心医院和武汉市疾控中心的不明原因发热患者标本一份。
On December 26, 2019, the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center collected a specimen of an unexplained febrile patient from Wuhan Central Hospital and Wuhan CDC.
最早公开发布新型冠状病毒全基因序列的专家，上海市公共卫生临床中心兼职教授张永振解释说，团队长期与武汉中心医院、武汉疾控合作科研项目，此次标本是项目常规收集。
Zhang Yongzhen, an adjunct professor at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and one of the first experts to publicly release the new coronavirus gene sequence, explained that the team had long cooperated with Wuhan Central Hospital and Wuhan CDC.
这份标本来自在华南海鲜市场工作的一名41岁男性，12月20日发病，在发热、咳嗽6天后前往武汉中心医院就诊并住院。
The specimen, from a 41-year-old man working at the South China Seafood Market, was admitted to Wuhan Central Hospital on December 20 after suffering from fever and cough.
四天后，中科院武汉病毒所在2019年12月30日晚，收到武汉金银潭医院送来的不明原因肺炎样品。
Four days later, the Wuhan Virus Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences received an unidentified pneumonia sample from Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital on the evening of December 30, 2019.
随后，中科院武汉病毒所、中国疾控中心病毒所、上海市公共卫生临床中心三地科研人员在实验室彻夜忙碌，分别于1月2日、1月3日、1月5日凌晨，获得病毒全基因组序列。
Later, researchers from Wuhan Virus Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China CDC Virus Institute and Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center worked all night in the laboratory and obtained complete genome sequence of the virus in the early hours of January 2, 3 January and 5 January respectively.
三个科研团队的基因组研究结果均证明，这是一种从未在人类中发现的全新冠状病毒。
Genomics studies by three teams of researchers have shown that this is a completely new coronavirus that has never been found in humans.
它不同于冠状病毒家族中早已“声名显赫”的SARS病毒和MERS病毒，是这个家族的第7名成员。
It is different from the coronavirus family has long been "famous" SARS virus and MERS virus, is the family's seventh member.
获得全基因组序列只是第一步，从标本中分离出病毒，才可以揪出真正的“罪魁祸首”。
Getting a complete genome sequence is only the first step in isolating the virus from the specimen to uncover the true "culprit."
通常情况下，从病人中发现病原的核酸、基因组，短期内可以完成，但病原的分离则需要数周时间。
Normally, nucleic acids and genomes of the pathogen are found in patients and can be completed in the short term, but the isolation of the pathogen takes weeks.
这次没用太久。
It didn't take long.
据病原检测结果初步评估专家组组长、中国工程院院士徐建国介绍，截至1月7日21时，实验室从1例阳性病人样本中分离出该病毒。
According to Xu Jianguo, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and leader of the group of experts on the preliminary assessment of pathogen testing, the laboratory isolated the virus from a positive patient sample as of 2100 hours on January 7.
而中科院武汉病毒所似乎更早完成了这一步骤。
Wuhan Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences seems to have completed this step earlier.
据其官网消息，病毒所1月5日即已分离得到病毒毒株。
According to its official website, the virus has been isolated since January 5 virus strains.
1月9日官方宣布，“不明原因肺炎”的病原体初步判定为新型冠状病毒。
January 9, the official announced that "unknown causes of pneumonia" the pathogen was initially identified as a new coronavirus.
击倒林华的未知病毒被“抓了现行”。
The unknown virus that knocked Lin Hua down was "caught in action."
━━━━━艰难的溯源短时间内获得这一新型病毒的全基因组序列，被业内奉为里程碑式的突破。
Streams in the Genome of the New Virus Obtaining a complete genome sequence in a short time has been hailed as a landmark breakthrough by the industry.
1月11日，张永振团队成员悉尼大学爱德华·霍姆斯教授代表课题组在美国国家生物技术信息中心（NCBI）发布了获得的新型冠状病毒全基因组序列，首次向世界公布了新型冠状病毒的“身份证号码”。
On January 11, Professor Edward Holmes of the University of Sydney, a member of Zhang Yongzhen team, on behalf of the team, unveiled the new coronavirus genome-wide sequence at the US National Biotechnology Information Center (NCBI), releasing the new coronavirus "ID number."
当天，中国官方也宣布，将与世界卫生组织共享病毒基因序列。
On the same day, Chinese officials announced that they would share the virus gene sequence with the World Health Organization.
病毒是什么，科学家找到了答案，但病毒究竟从哪里来，又是怎样在自然界中迈出关键一步，踏入人类社会？获取病毒全基因序列为这样的病毒溯源铺好了前路。
Scientists have figured out what the virus is, but where does it come from, and how does it take a crucial step in nature, into human society? Getting a full genetic sequence of the virus paves the way for such a virus to trace its origins.
利用新型冠状病毒基因组序列，与从人类和不同动物身上发现的SARS病毒和冠状病毒进行基因和功能的比较分析，不仅可以了解它与SARS等其他冠状病毒家族成员的“远近亲疏”，还可以比较它与动物体内冠状病毒的相似性，推测它的来源。
A comparative analysis of the genes and functions of the coronavirus and the SARS coronavirus found in humans and other coronavirus can be used to compare the genomic sequence of the coronavirus with that of other coronavirus family members such as SARS.
新型冠状病毒在自然界的天然宿主是谁？目前多项科学证据指向蝙蝠。
Who is the natural host of the new coronavirus in nature? There is a lot of scientific evidence pointing to bats.
小小的蝙蝠，其实是病毒“集中营”。
The tiny bat, is actually the virus "concentration camp".
中国医学科学院病原生物学研究所所长金奇教授解释说，蝙蝠是许多病毒的自然宿主，包括埃博拉病毒、马尔堡病毒、狂犬病毒等。
Bats are the natural hosts of many viruses, including Ebola, Marburg virus and rabies virus, explained Professor Jin Qi, director of the Institute of Pathogenic Biology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
由于蝙蝠特殊的免疫系统，携带病毒却极少出现病症。
Due to the bat's special immune system, carrying the virus is rare.
在漫长的进化历程中，蝙蝠成为了上百种病毒的自然宿主。
Over the long course of evolution, bats have become the natural hosts of hundreds of viruses.
在中科院武汉病毒所石正丽、周鹏团队的研究中，新冠病毒与一种在云南发现的蝙蝠冠状病毒有96%同源性。
In a study by the team of Zhengli and Zhou Peng of Wuhan Virus Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the new crown virus was 96% homologous with a bat coronavirus found in Yunnan Province.
中科院上海巴斯德研究所、军事医学研究院等3家机构的研究，同样推测新冠病毒自然宿主可能是蝙蝠。
A study by three institutions, the Shanghai Pasteur Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Military Medicine, also speculated that bats might be the natural hosts of the new crown virus.
1月24日，中国疾控中心等多家机构发表的一项研究论文再次印证这一结论。
On January 24, a research paper published by China's CDC and others confirmed this conclusion.
论文披露，12月31日，中国疾控中心曾派出一支快速应急小组，前往武汉协助当地卫生部门开展调查。
On December 31, the CDC dispatched a rapid response team to Wuhan to assist local health authorities in the investigation, the paper said.
小组通过对3名武汉金银潭医院患者的样本分析，发现新型冠状病毒与已知的蝙蝠体内分离到的SARS样冠状病毒(bat-SL-CoVZC45,。
The team analyzed samples from three patients at Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital and found that the new coronavirus was isolated from the known bat body of SARS coronavirus (bat-SL-CoVZC45).
MG772933.1)有86.9%的核酸序列一致性。
MG772933.1 had 86.9% nucleic acid sequence consistency.
这一结论，被写入国家卫健委第四版新冠肺炎诊疗方案。
This conclusion is included in the fourth edition of the National Health Commission new crown pneumonia diagnosis and treatment program.
━━━━━谁是中间宿主但从蝙蝠到人，是否存在中间宿主，又是谁扮演了这个角色，科学家还在寻找。
George Eliot Who is the intermediate host But scientists are still searching for an intermediate host, from a bat to a human, whether there is an intermediate host, and who plays that role.
浙江大学医学院第一医院、传染病诊治国家重点实验室教授肖永红解释说，正常条件下，蝙蝠病毒不会直接感染人类，而是需要一个中介，通常是哺乳动物，才能传染到人。
Xiao Yonghong, professor at Zhejiang University's First Hospital and National Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Treatment, explained that under normal conditions, the bat virus does not directly infect humans, but requires an intermediary, usually a mammal, to infect humans.
这中间的“跳板”就是中间宿主。
The "springboard" in between is the intermediate host.
他举例说，比如SARS病毒中间宿主是果子狸，MERS病毒中间宿主是骆驼。
For example, the intermediate host of a SARS virus is a civet, and the intermediate host of a MERS virus is a camel, he said.
在他参与的北京大学教授朱怀球团队的研究中，深度学习算法推测，中间宿主可能是水貂。
In a study by his Peking University professor Zhu Huaqiu's team, deep-learning algorithms speculated that the intermediate host might be mink.
但他提醒，这只是为病原学专家提供一个研究思路，一切都还要实验室的研究才能得出最终结论。
But he cautions that this is just a research idea for etiology experts, and that it will take laboratory research to come to a final conclusion.
继水貂之后，穿山甲也获得“提名”。
After the mink, the pangolin was also nominated.
2月7日凌晨，华南农业大学发布消息称，穿山甲或为新型冠状病毒潜在中间宿主。
February 7, the South China Agricultural University announced that the pangolin or a new potential intermediate host of coronavirus.
科研人员给出了更多证据：通过分析1000多份宏基因组样品，锁定穿山甲为潜在中间宿主。
Researchers have given more evidence: by analyzing more than 1,000 macro-genome samples, the pangolin was targeted as a potential intermediate host.
进而发现穿山甲中β冠状病毒的阳性率为70%；且病毒在电镜下观察到典型的冠状病毒颗粒结构；此外，基因组分析还发现，分离的病毒株与目前感染人的毒株序列相似度高达99%。
The positive rate of coronavirus in pangolin was 70% and the typical coronavirus particle structure was observed under electron microscopy. Genomic analysis also showed that the isolated strain was 99% similar to that of the present infected human strain.
这一研究结论也进入官方视野。
The findings are also in official view.
科技部社会发展科技司司长吴远彬透露，科技部正组织有关科研团队对上述研究结论进行论证。
Ministry of Science and Technology Secretary for Social Development and Science Wu Yun-bin revealed that the Ministry of Science and Technology is organizing research teams to validate the findings.
就在2月18日，一项新的研究再度锁定穿山甲。
Just February 18, a new study locked in pangolins again.
香港大学新发传染性疾病国家重点实验室主任管轶教授，以及广西医科大学胡艳玲教授发表在BioRxiv上的研究文章，为穿山甲是新型冠状病毒动物宿主提供了最新的证据。
Professor Guan Yi, director of the National Key Laboratory for Emerging Infectious Diseases of the University of Hong Kong, and Professor Hu Yanling of Guangxi Medical University, published in BioRxiv provide the latest evidence that pangolin is the new coronavirus host.
研究通过对中国南方走私的马来穿山甲的基因组序列进行测序后，得出重要结论：这些在穿山甲身上新发现的冠状病毒与感染人的新冠病毒有85.5％至92.4％的相似性。
After sequencing the genome sequence of the malay pangolin smuggled from southern China, it was concluded that the coronavirus found in pangolins was 85.5% to 92.4% similar to that in humans.
穿山甲应被视为新冠病毒可能的中间宿主。
Pangolin should be considered as a possible intermediate host for the new crown virus.
━━━━━迷雾中的传染源动物溯源之外，新冠病毒的起源地同样被迷雾笼罩。
Streams The source of infection in the mist The origin of the new crown virus is also obscured by fog.
中国疾控中心多项前期研究结论均将矛头指向华南海鲜市场，“病毒最先出现在武汉华南海鲜市场”几乎成为社会共识。
China CDC many early research conclusions point to the South China seafood market, "the virus first appeared in Wuhan South China Seafood Market" has almost become a social consensus.
但1月下旬，国际医学期刊柳叶刀发表的一项研究结论似乎与此相悖。
But in late January, a study published in the international medical journal Lancet appeared to contradict this.
这项研究由中日医院呼吸与危重症医学科主任曹彬、武汉金银潭医院院长张定宇等多位临床医学专家共同参与。
The study was conducted by Cao Bin, director of respiratory and critical medical science at the China-Japan Hospital, and Zhang Dingyu, director of Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital.
研究证实，最早一例新型冠状病毒肺炎患者于12月1日发病，没有发现该病例与华南海鲜市场有联系，而且在最早的前4名感染者中，有3人没有华南市场暴露史。
The study confirmed that one of the first cases of coronavirus pneumonia occurred on December 1, that there was no link to the South China seafood market, and that three of the first four infected people did not have a history of exposure to the South China market.
在《科学》杂志的报道中，曹彬袒露了自己的不确定，“华南海鲜市场似乎并不是病毒的仅有起源地；实话说，我们现在还不太清楚病毒到底从哪里来”。
"The South China seafood market doesn't seem to be the only source of the virus; to be honest, we don't know exactly where it came from," Cao revealed in a report in the journal Science.
不过，在最近一次的官方表态中，华南海鲜市场仍是最有可能的发源地。
However, in a recent official announcement, the South China seafood market remains the most likely source.
2月15日，吴远彬在新闻发布会上重申了此前的研究结论：中国疾控中心从华南海鲜市场及武汉其他生鲜市场获取的585份环境样本中，33份呈新冠病毒阳性样本中，其中31份来自经营野生动物华南海鲜市场西区。
Wu reiterated his previous findings at a press conference on Feb. 15: Of the 585 environmental samples collected by the CDC from the South China seafood market and other fresh markets in Wuhan, 33 tested positive for the new crown virus, of which 31 were from the Western Area, which operates the South China Seafood Market.
“这些数据提示，此次疫情可能与野生动物交易有关。
"These data suggest that the outbreak may be linked to the wildlife trade.
”吴远彬说。
"said Wu.
━━━━━消失的“零号病人”对于新发传染病来说，第一名感染病毒的患者身上承载了诸多关键信息。
The Lost Patient 0 For new infectious diseases, the first person infected with the virus carries a lot of key information.
公众把这名患者称作“零号病人”。
The public called the patient "patient zero."
因其自带的神秘感，坊间关于“零号病人”的传说一度盛行。
Because of its mystique, the fable about "patient zero" once prevailed.
浙江大学生命科学研究院教授王立铭说，“零号病人”对应的学术用语是“原发病例”，通俗理解为在这位患者身上“某种病毒首次从动物进入了人体”。
Professor Wang Liming, a professor at Zhejiang University's Life Sciences Research Institute, said the academic term "zero" corresponded to a "primary case," understood colloquially as "the first time a virus has entered the human body from an animal."
确认“零号病人”，对病毒的溯源以及疫情的传播至关重要。
Confirming "patient zero" is essential for the traceability of the virus and the spread of the outbreak.
北京大学公共卫生学院教授宁毅认为，目前我们并不确认新冠病毒从动物到人类的信息，“如果零号病人接触到的是我们怀疑的蝙蝠、果子狸、穿山甲等常见暴露因素，但我们没有发现，其他人接触到这种暴露因素就可能发病。
Ning Yi, a professor at the Peking University School of Public Health, said: "We do not currently confirm the information from animals to humans of the new crown virus." If Patient Zero is exposed to common exposure factors such as bats, beavers and pangolins that we suspect, we have not found that other people are susceptible to such exposure. "
这就是我们寻找零号病人的意义。
That's what we're looking for in number zero.
”目前已知的最早一名患者在2019年12月1日发病。
The earliest known patient developed symptoms on December 1, 2019.
武汉金银潭医院记录了这名患者的就医记录，在该院重症监护室主任吴文娟的回忆中，这是一名年过七旬的男子，患有脑梗、老年痴呆，几乎不出门，住处离华南海鲜市场很近，但从未去过。
Wu Wenjuan, director of Wuhan's intensive care unit, a 70-year-old man with cerebral infarction, Alzheimer's disease, barely moved out of the house and lived close to the South China seafood market but had never been there, according to Wu Wenjuan, director of the intensive care unit.
足不出户的他如何被感染？这名患者是真正的“零号病人”吗？在他之前是否还有其他人感染但从未就医？据中国疾控中心在2月17日公布的一份报告，在2019年12月31日之前，武汉和湖北已经有104名感染者发病。
How did he get infected when he did not leave his home? Was the patient a real "patient zero"? Was there anyone else infected before him but never treated? According to a report released on February 17 by the China CDC, 104 infected people had been infected in Wuhan and Hubei by December 31, 2019.
这些新增的患者能否揭示疫情早期更多的秘密，有待进一步考证。
It remains to be seen whether these new patients will reveal more secrets about the early stages of the outbreak.
不过，我们必须有心理准备——“零号病人”的寻找可能是一项不可能完成的任务。
But we have to be prepared for the fact that finding Patient Zero may be an impossible task.
时至今日，艾滋病、埃博拉、SARS等疫情从未明确找到严格意义上的“零号病人”。
To this day, AIDS, Ebola, SARS and other epidemics have never been clearly identified in the strict sense of the term "zero patients."
━━━━━寻找“解药”争议声外，另一路科研人员，正在寻找新型冠状病毒的特效药。
Finding the "antidote" controversy aside, researchers along the road are looking for a specific drug for the new coronavirus.
相比于研发新药，“老药新用”是危急时刻的急救之法。
Instead of developing new drugs, "old drugs for new use" is a way of first aid in times of crisis.
最早被寄予厚望的是抗艾滋药物“克力芝”（洛匹那韦/利托那韦）。
The first high hopes were placed in the anti-AIDS drug "Calysz" (Lopinavir / ritonavir).
作为一种蛋白酶抑制剂，克力芝可以使病毒复制产生的是不具有再生能力、非成熟形态的艾滋病毒颗粒，从而达到降低艾滋病毒载量的作用。
As a protease inhibitor, Kaletra enables the replication of viruses to produce non-regenerative, immature forms of HIV granules, thus reducing the HIV load.
因多位专家提示克力芝对新冠肺炎可能有效，且国家诊疗方案中提及可试用克力芝治疗，在2020年这场肺炎疫情中，这款已问世20多年的抗病毒药物迎来了自己的“高光时刻”。
The more than 20-year-old antiviral drug has taken on a "high-light moment" in the wake of the outbreak of pneumonia in 2020 after several experts suggested that the drug might be effective in treating new crown pneumonia and the national diagnosis and treatment plan mentions experimenting with Kaletra.
新冠肺炎患者定点收治医院、武汉金银潭医院院长张定宇是克力芝的支持者之一。
Zhang Dingyu, director of Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital, is one of the supporters of Calderon.
他正在进行一项198例患者参与的对比试验，部分患者服用克力芝，另一部分服用安慰剂，以判断克力芝对新冠肺炎的治疗效果。
He is conducting a comparative study of 198 patients, some taking Kaletra and the other a placebo, to determine the efficacy of Kaletra in treating new crown pneumonia.
“目前为止，看上去克力芝能够降低死亡率，减少危重病例发生率。
"So far, it seems, Kaletra has been able to reduce mortality and the incidence of serious cases.
”在他的观察中，艾滋病人服用此药的，新冠肺炎感染率有所降低：追踪了1000多例，只有3-5例感染新冠肺炎。
In his observations, the rate of infection with Newcrown Pneumonia fell among people with the drug: more than 1,000 cases were tracked and only three to five cases were newly infected.
不过，艾滋病治疗专家、北京协和医院感染内科主任李太生对此持观望态度，“当年SARS、MERS疫情暴发时，都有人提到用艾滋病药物治疗，但都没有临床数据支撑。
However, Li Tai-sheng, an AIDS therapist and director of infectious medicine at Beijing Concorde Hospital, was on the sidelines. "When SARS and MERS broke out, people mentioned AIDS drugs, but none of them were clinically supported.
”有无效果，需要等待严格的科学实验结果。
Whether it works or not will require the results of rigorous scientific experiments.
同样等待临床数据的还有3种药物：磷酸氯喹、法匹拉韦、瑞德西韦。
Also awaiting clinical data are three drugs: chloroquine phosphate, apilavir, and Rhetsevir.
此前，它们分别用于疟疾、流感和埃博拉出血热的治疗。
Previously, they were used to treat malaria, influenza and Ebola haemorrhagic fever, respectively.
目前，上述3种药物在武汉等地已经陆续启动临床试验。
At present, the above three drugs in Wuhan and other places have started clinical trials.
患者、公众、医生、科学家正翘首以盼。
Patients, the public, doctors, scientists are looking forward to it.
寻找特效药的同时，人们把疫苗视作另一根“救命稻草”。
While looking for specific drugs, people see vaccines as another "lifesaver."
灭活疫苗、MRNA疫苗、重组蛋白疫苗、病毒载体疫苗、DNA疫苗，不同技术的新冠疫苗正在全球同步研发中，在中国，已有多种疫苗进入动物试验阶段。
Inactivated vaccines, MRNA vaccines, recombinant protein vaccines, viral vector vaccines, DNA vaccines, new canopy vaccines of different technologies are being developed simultaneously globally, and a variety of vaccines have entered the animal testing phase in China.
中国科学院微生物研究所研究员严景华所在的团队，正在进行新冠重组蛋白疫苗研发，之前MERS疫苗的研发经验为这次研发帮上了忙。
Yan Jinghua, a researcher at the Institute of Microbiology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is working on a new canopy recombinant protein vaccine, helped by research and development experience with the MERS vaccine.
为争取疫苗早日上市，团队尽可能缩短研发周期。
In order to achieve an early launch of vaccines, the team as short as possible R & D cycle.
过去，一个试验结束，要看看结果再进行第二个试验，现在很多试验改为同步推进。
In the past, at the end of an experiment, to see if the results were followed by a second trial, many experiments are now being carried out simultaneously.
她透露，目前疫苗研发进展顺利，正在动物体内进行测试观察免疫效果，后续还要进行安全性测试。
She said the vaccine is progressing well, with tests being carried out in animals to see the effects of immunization, followed by safety tests.
疫苗何时能研发成功？科技部2月22日给出了时间表：最快4月下旬申报临床试验。
When will the vaccine be developed? The ministry gave a timetable on Feb. 22: declare clinical trials as early as late April.
这是人们必须接受的一个残酷现实。
This is a harsh reality that must be accepted.
对于一种新发现的病原体来说，疫苗研发成功并最终实现量产走向普通公众，可能需要数月时间来完成。
For a newly discovered pathogen, successful vaccine development and eventual mass production to the general public may take months to complete.
而这相对于通常需要数年甚至10年计的疫苗研发来说，已经跑出了最快速度。
This is the fastest rate of vaccine development, which usually takes years or even 10 years.
