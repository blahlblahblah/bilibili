”预印本发布网站SSRN3月3日发布了一篇题为“Women May Play a More Important Role in the Transmission of the Corona Virus Disease （COVID-19） than Men”（女性在2019新冠病毒传播中可能比男性扮演了更重要的角色）的论文，分析了在新冠病毒传播中女性可能存在特殊性。
A paper published on March 3 by SSRN, the pre-printed publication website, entitled "Women May Play a More Important Role in the Transmission of the Corona Virus Disase (COVID-19) than men (women may play a more important role than men in the transmission of the new crown virus 2019), which analyses possible female particularities in the transmission of the virus.
论文研究由武汉大学人民医院肿瘤科、老年医学科、重症加强医疗科等多个科室完成，通讯作者为武汉大学人民医消化内科主任医师董卫国与耳鼻喉科主任医师许昱。
The thesis is carried out by the Department of Oncology, Geriatrics and Severe Intensive Medical Unit of Wuhan University. The author of the paper is Dong Wei-guo and Xu Yu, Chief Physician of People's Medicine and Digestion of Wuhan University.
该研究为一个回顾性研究，研究样本主要包含两部分，一是研究人员使用“新型冠状病毒”、“ 2019-nCoV”、“ COVID-19”和“新型冠状病毒性肺炎”等关键词在PubMed、Web of Science和中国知网（CNKI）多个数据库中搜索了截至2020年2月14日发表的相关文章，最终选取9篇包含确诊病例的文献；另一部分则是武汉大学人民医院于2020年2月20日之前诊断为COVID-19的所有患者。
The study was a retrospective study in which the researchers used the terms "new coronavirus," "2019-nCoV," "COVID-19," and "new coronavirus pneumonia" in various databases of PubMed, Web of Science, and CNKI.
文献回顾部分中共有6013例确诊病例，包括3361例男性（55.9％）和2652例女性（44.1％）；武汉大学人民医院部分则共有2045例确诊病例，包括男性953例，女性1092例，这部分中轻度中度组，重度组和危重组的男性人数分别为454（47.6％），387（40.6％），112（11.8％），女性人数为612（56.0％），404（37.0％）和76 7.0％）。
In the literature review, there were 6,013 confirmed cases, including 3,361 males (55.9 per cent) and 2,652 females (44.1 per cent); in Wuhan University, there were 2,045 confirmed cases, including 953 males and 1,092 females, which were moderate to moderate, 387 (40.6%), 112 (11.8%) females (612 (56.0%), 404 (37.0%) and 76 7.0%).
研究认为，数据显示2020年1月1日之前，被诊断出的患者中34.0%是女性，但到了1月26日，女性比例上升到45.0%。
According to the study, 34.0 per cent of patients diagnosed before 1 January 2020 were women, but by 26 January the proportion of women had risen to 45.0 per cent.
回顾部分中，男性有3361例，占55.9%，进入ICU的患者共有975例，其中573例（58.8%）为男性。
In the retrospective section, 3,361 (55.9 per cent) were men and 975 (58.8 per cent) were men.
而在67例无症状感染病例中有47例是女性。
Of the 67 cases of asymptomatic infection, 47 were women.
研究认为这表明，女性不仅在轻中度患者中占很大比例，而且在无症状感染中也占很大比例。
The study suggests that this suggests that women not only make up a large proportion of mild to moderate patients, but also a large proportion of asymptomatic infections.
无症状感染比例高，早期患者比例小这几点让研究人员认为，女性不仅症状相对较轻，而且可能比男性有更长的潜伏期。
The high rate of asymptomatic infections and the small percentage of early sufferers lead researchers to believe that women not only have relatively mild symptoms but may also have longer latency periods than men.
这可能是因为女性天生具有比男性更强的抗病毒免疫力。
This may be because women are born with stronger antiviral immunity than men.
前期女性没有被确诊并不意味着没有被感染，只是其症状较轻或无症状。
The fact that a woman has not been diagnosed in the early stages does not mean that she is not infected, but her symptoms are mild or asymptomatic.
研究者采用性激素和免疫系统之间的相互作用理论来解释这一研究结果，该理论认为通常女性趋向于产生更强的免疫反应，这有助于她们更快地清除感染并降低疾病持续发展的风险。
The researchers used the theory of interactions between sex hormones and the immune system to explain the finding, which suggests that women tend to produce stronger immune responses, which helps them to clear infections faster and reduce the risk of disease progression.
但是只要存在病毒感染，病毒就会不停地与人体的免疫系统抗争。
But as long as there is a virus infection, the virus will constantly struggle with the body's immune system.
在病毒突破免疫系统之前，人体没有任何疾病症状，这也就是潜伏期。
Before the virus breaks through the immune system, the body does not show any signs of disease, which is the incubation period.
当人体的的免疫力能够抵御病毒更长的时间，但又不能完全杀死它时，就会有更长的潜伏期。
A longer incubation period occurs when the body's immune system is able to withstand the virus for longer periods of time without completely killing it.
因此研究人员建议，尽快对女性采取差异化的疾控措施。
Therefore, the researchers recommend that differential disease control measures be adopted for women as soon as possible.
如，在筛查过程中，应该对接触史明确的女性直接进行核酸测试，无论是否有症状，受医学观察的女性隔离期也应超过14天。
For example, during screening, women with a well-established history of exposure should be directly tested for nucleic acid, and women under medical observation should be isolated for periods longer than 14 days, with or without symptoms.
并且“进一步研究女性在这一疾病流行中的作用，尽早为女性单独制定隔离和诊断计划”。
And "further study the role of women in the epidemic, as early as possible separate isolation and diagnosis plans for women."
但一位免疫学家对界面新闻表示，目前看这一研究结果存在缺陷，尚不足以支撑这一论点。
But one immunologist told Interface News that the current findings were flawed and did not support the argument.
如果是基于性激素和免疫系统之间的相互作用理来分析男女性对于新冠病毒的易感程度与潜伏期，在样本选择上应当去除绝经后年龄段的女性与同年龄段男性，其次还应该去除怀孕的女性，因为女性绝经后男女的性激素水平趋同，如果这一年龄段的男女感染水平依然有明显差异，那也应当寻找其他原因，如外出频率，接触人群等。
If it is based on the interaction between sex hormones and the immune system to analyze the susceptibility and latency of males and females to the new crown virus, post-menopausal women and men of the same age group should be removed from the sample selection.
并且判断发病时间也与患者自身的敏感度有关，如患者是否感觉身体无力、发热，每个人对此的敏感程度也并不一样。
And the time of onset is also related to the patient's own sensitivity, such as whether the patient feels weak, febrile, everyone is not the same sensitivity.
此外，他认为，这一研究虽然基于激素理论，但缺乏患者激素水平数据做参考，仅是纯粹进行了数据分析，价值有限。
In addition, he said the study, while based on hormone theory, lacked data on patient hormone levels for reference and was purely data-based and of limited value.
仅根据这一现象就得出结论并不合适。
It is not appropriate to draw conclusions from this phenomenon alone.
