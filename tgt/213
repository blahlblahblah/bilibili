经济观察报 见习记者 陈月芹1月29日凌晨3点，家住武汉硚口的李馨在微博、知乎等社区平台上求助：“我不知道怎么样才能排到一个珍贵的床位，为什么明明说好接收所有疑似病人，现实却是辗转求医，没有医院收治，甚至连打针都不行。
"I don't know how to row into a precious bed, why I said to accept all the suspected patients, but the reality is that there is no hospital treatment, not even injection.
”。
"
为了增加曝光度，她选择一次次转发时附加上热搜话题。
In order to increase the exposure, she chose to forward again and again with the topic of hot search.
。
.
1月17号，李馨父亲开始咳嗽，1月22日开始发热，一度烧到39.5度。
January 17, Li Xin father began to cough, January 22 began to fever, once burning to 39.5 degrees.
考虑到武汉疫情严重，一开始李馨不敢去医院，担心交叉感染。
Considering the serious epidemic in Wuhan, Li Xin did not dare to go to the hospital at first, fearing cross-infection.
出现高热后，李父并无网上所说的乏力厌食等症状，李馨便买来退烧药，可是父亲吃了四天，高烧并未退下来。
After the high fever, Li did not say on-line anorexia fatigue symptoms, Li Xin bought antipyretics, but the father ate four days, high fever did not recede.
。
.
这让李馨骤然紧张起来。
This makes Li Xin suddenly nervous.
1月26日下午，湖北省委书记、省新型肺炎防控指挥部指挥长蒋超良表示，要对所有疑似患者一律无条件收治，并有效隔离。
On the afternoon of January 26, the secretary of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee and commander of the new provincial command for pneumonia prevention and control, Jiang Xiuliang, said that all suspected patients should be treated unconditionally and effectively isolated.
。
.
为让高烧多天、已经出现呼吸困难的父亲有个床位，李馨求助过的名单已经划掉了长长的一串：硚口当地社区、120、各大医院、卫建委、疾控中心疫情防控线索界面......她甚至打电话给110举报自己的父亲。
To give her father a bed with fever and breathing difficulties for days, Li has scratched out a long list of names: local community Zhangkou, 120 hospitals, health committees, CDC disease control cues... She even called 110 to report her father.
。
.
找一个床位。
Find a bed.
1月26日出现厌食乏力等症状后，李馨带父亲去了武汉普爱医院拍肺部CT。
January 26 appear anorexia fatigue and other symptoms, Li Xin took his father to Wuhan Puai Hospital to take a lung CT.
成片显示，李父肺部有毛玻璃阴影，被诊为双肺病毒性肺炎。
The film shows that Li's lungs were shaded by plexiglass and he was diagnosed with two-lung viral pneumonia.
。
.
医生说，他属于高度疑似病例，很大可能是新型冠状病毒肺炎，但普爱医院没有试剂盒，没有办法做核酸检测，因而无法确诊和办理住院，最后开了连花清瘟胶囊和乳酸左氧氟沙星片，让回家隔离。
The doctor said he was a highly suspected case, most likely a new coronavirus pneumonia, but PU-I did not have a kit and could not be tested for nucleic acid, so he could not be diagnosed and hospitalized. Finally, Lianhuaqing distemper capsules and levofloxacin lactate tablets were prescribed to isolate him at home.
。
.
1月27日，李父服用医院开的药物和美林退烧药，并没有好转，反而更加严重了，“开始浑身发力，不停地咳嗽，呼吸越来越接不上，走路都要扶着墙”。
Instead of improving, Li took hospital-prescribed drugs and Merrill Lynch antipyretics on January 27. "He began to cough all over, breathing less and less, and walked against the wall."
。
.
病情恶化速度之快，让李馨坚定认为父亲可能患上新型冠状肺炎，找到能收治的医院，变得刻不容缓。
The rapid deterioration of the disease, so that Li Xin firmly believe that his father may be suffering from new coronary pneumonia, to find a hospital can become urgent.
。
.
原本一家三口在家各自隔离，父亲还能偶尔打一下电话，微信上打打字和自己交流，但到了1月28日，父亲出现明显的呼吸困难，说话都没有力气，一直在家里躺着。
My father was able to make occasional phone calls, type letters and talk to himself, but by January 28, he had obvious breathing difficulties and was unable to speak.
。
.
1月28日早晨，李馨通过朋友关系得知协和西院有600个床位，让早点去争取一下。
On the morning of January 28, Li Xin learned from friends that the Concorde West Court had 600 beds.
。
.
早上8点多，120回复称，发热病人需要提前得到协和医院的安排，才能前往住院。
In the early hours of the morning, 120 replied that febrile patients needed to get prior arrangements from Concorde Hospital before they could be admitted to hospital.
。
.
一位医生告诉李馨，现在武汉所有的定点医院，不能私下收治病人，一定得走社区的流程——病人将情况上报社区卫生服务中心，社区再上报到本区附近的医院，开始“排位”。
A doctor told Li Xin that all the designated hospitals in Wuhan could not accept patients privately, but must go through the process of the community - the patients reported the situation to the community health service centers, the community reported to the nearby hospitals, began to "rank."
。
.
社区分诊是从1月24日开始的，武汉市新型肺炎防控指挥部决定全面实行发热市民分级分类就医服务，武汉新冠战疫的“前线”也从定点医院发热门诊，下沉到各大社区卫生服务中心。
Since January 24, the Wuhan New Pneumonia Prevention and Control Command has decided to fully implement the classification of febrile citizens for medical treatment, and the "front line" of the new epidemic in Wuhan has gone down from the designated hospitals to the major community health service centers.
。
.
另一方面，由于交通管制，即使协和西院刚好有空的床位，家住硚口区的父亲也不能直接跨区去位于沌口的协和医院西院，需要社区卫生服务中心开具证明。
On the other hand, due to traffic control, even if Concorde West courtyard just vacant beds, the father of Zheng mouth area can not directly cross-district in illegible mouth of Concorde Hospital West courtyard, need to be certified by the community health service center.
。
.
李馨带着父亲去往同济医院，同济医院说挂号已满，不接受发热病人。
Li Xin took his father to Tongji Hospital, Tongji Hospital said the registration is full, do not accept fever patients.
。
.
最后，李馨还是带着父亲去最早的普爱医院，此时父亲已经呼吸困难，但普爱医院表示只有检测之后才能提供吸氧或者其他治疗方案。
Finally, Li Xin took her father to the earliest universal love hospital, when he was already having difficulty breathing, but the hospital said only after testing can provide oxygen or other treatment options.
。
.
在这里抽了血，李馨和父亲以为这是要开始试剂盒检测，但下午拿到的结果发现，只是一份普通的查血报告。
Blood was pumped here and Li Xin and his father thought it was time to start a kit test, but the results this afternoon turned out to be just a normal blood test.
。
.
一天跑三趟医院，仍没法安排住院或试剂盒检测。
Three times a day, the hospital is still unable to arrange hospitalization or kit testing.
。
.
今年54岁的李父，有乙肝小三阳、冠状动脉粥样硬化等慢性病，属于感染后高危人群。
This year's 54-year-old Li Fu, has hepatitis B small three Yang, coronary atherosclerosis and other chronic diseases, is a high-risk group after infection.
看着父亲愈加憔悴，1月29日，李馨开始给每家医院打电话，询问是否有试剂盒做核酸检测，得到的回复都是做不了。
Looking at his father more gaunt, January 29, Li Xin began to call every hospital, asking if there is a kit for nucleic acid testing, the response was not done.
另一边，她多次联系社区能否争取个床位，社区的回复是不行，但可以送父亲去打针。
On the other hand, she repeatedly contacted the community to get a bed, the community response is no, but can send the father to injection.
。
.
“父亲已经不太适合去医院打针了”，李馨说，父亲已经高烧8天，而医院里发热病人众多，呼吸困难的父亲已经没法戴口罩，“这是一个两难的选择”。
"My father is not fit to go to the hospital for an injection," Li said. "It's a dilemma when my father has a fever for eight days and the hospital has so many feverish patients that he can't wear a mask."
。
.
由于父亲所在的硚口区是重灾区，汉口的医院排队遥遥无期。
As the father of the Zhangkou area is a serious disaster area, Hankou hospitals line up in a remote.
看到许多热心朋友发来蔡甸区哪些医院有新增床位的消息后，李馨询问社区，“为什么不能帮我们联系蔡甸的医院？”得到的答案很简单，“住院不能跨区”。
After seeing news from many warm-hearted friends about which hospitals in Cai Den had new beds, Li Xin asked the community, "Why can't you contact Cai Den's hospital?" The answer was simple: "Hospitalization can't cross the district."
。
.
等了一天，社区依旧没有床位的消息。
After a day of waiting, the community was still without beds.
当晚，李馨想到的办法是，也许只能再把人带去医院，重新做一次肺部CT，才能加大入选机会。
That night, Li Xin thought of the solution, may have to take people to the hospital, to do a lung CT, in order to increase the chance to be selected.
。
.
李馨在1月30日，拨打了110、120、12345市长热线，均被告知必须上报社区，由社区筛选上报到卫健委，经过卫健委专家筛选后将名单提供给医院，医院通知社区，病人才可能有床位。
On January 30, Li Xin called Mayors' Hotlines 110, 120 and 12345 and was told that they must be reported to the community, screened by the community and reported to the health care committee.
。
.
然而，李馨在社区“微邻里”登记的肺炎自查报告，许多天下来都没有通过审核，这是社区上报至街道、卫健委等所有流程的第一步。
However, Li Xin in the community "micro-neighborhood" registered pneumonia self-examination report, many days down the passed audit, this is the community reported to the streets, the Wei Wei Commission and all other procedures the first step.
。
.
“我要去休息会儿了我不能倒。
"I'm going to rest for a while.
”凌晨3:19，李馨更新了微博。
At 3: 19 in the morning, Li Xin updated her microblog.
。
.
一波三折。
Every wave breaks.
1月31日上午，社区工作人员通知李馨，父亲能去社区附近的隔离点救治，将人扶下楼，好不容易到了隔离点，对方却说没有床位。
On the morning of January 31, community workers informed Li Xin that his father was able to go to the isolation point near the community for treatment and help people down the stairs.
。
.
但负责运送父亲的工作人员坚称，之前联系隔离点时，还有5个床位。
However, the staff in charge of transporting the father maintained that there were five beds left when the isolation point was contacted.
。
.
“回来的时候直接倒地上去了。
"Come back and lie down on the floor.
”李馨希望再次落空。
Again Li Xin hoped to fail.
。
.
1月31日上午10点，华中科技大学同济医学院附属同济医院中法新城院区被指定为“武汉市新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎危重病人救治定点医院”，开放床位600张，该医院1月27日晚上已经开始收治病人，并调配300名医生和600名护士专门值守。
At 10: 00 a.m. on January 31, 2006, the Tongji Hospital of Tongji Hospital, affiliated with Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, was designated as the "Hospital for the Treatment of Serious Pneumonia Infected by the New Coronavirus in Wuhan City.
。
.
到了晚上7点，社区的工作人员告诉李馨，“你的爸爸本来应该还得两天才能走（送去医院），但考虑到你父亲的重症情况，所以提前安排了。
At 7: 00 pm, community workers told Li Xin, "Your father should have had two days to walk [to the hospital], but given your father's serious condition, it was arranged ahead of time.
今天准备送到医院，明天开始核酸检测，但是你爸爸身体条件太差了，别人不愿意接。
I'm going to the hospital today, and tomorrow I'm gonna have a nucleic acid test, But your dad's in such poor shape that people won't take it.
”。
"
过了1个小时，同济医院中法新城院区传来消息，由于父亲属于危重病人，可以到同济医院中法新城院区住院。
An hour later, news came from the French New Town Hospital in Tongji Hospital that his father was critically ill and could be hospitalized in the French New Town Hospital.
。
.
晚上10点，父亲终于成功住院。
At 10 p.m., my father finally managed to stay in hospital.
“住上了，同济中法。
"Yes, Tongzhong Method.
”李馨如释重负敲下这这7个字。
Li Xin knocked down these seven words with relief.
。
.
2月1日下午，李馨在同济医院中法新城院区办理住院手续。
February 1 afternoon, Li Xin in Tongji Hospital in the French new city district to go through the hospital formalities.
与此同时，仍有很多网友在微博上求助如何住院，他的家人同样高烧10天，呼吸困难，高度疑似病例，没有试剂盒，没有床位......。
Meanwhile, many netizens still turn to Weibo for help with hospitalization, his family also having a 10-day fever, breathing difficulties, highly suspicious cases, no kit, no beds...
这两天，李馨发现自己也开始咳嗽了。
These two days, Li Xin found that she also began to cough.
。
.
2月3日凌晨5点，李馨向经济观察网传来消息，仅住院不到两天的父亲因为呼吸衰竭，抢救无效，已经离开了，而她连父亲最后一面都没见上。
On February 3 at 5 a.m., Li Xin told the Economic Observation Network that her father, who had been in hospital for less than two days, had left because of respiratory failure. She had not seen her father for the last time.
。
.
刚住上院时，父亲难得看到病情变好的希望，看着女儿为自己奔波，还对她说：“你要好好保护好自己，中奖太累太辛苦了”。
When he first lived in the Upper House, he seldom saw the hope of getting better. He watched his daughter run for himself and said to her, "You must take good care of yourself.
。
.
“如果能早点得到治疗，是不是会不一样了？”李馨反复说。
"If can get treatment earlier, won't it be different?" Li Xin repeated.
。
.
直到父亲去世，李馨在社区“微邻里”登记的肺炎自查报告，仍然显示“在处理”。
Until his father died, Li Xin registered with the community's "micro-neighborhood" pneumonia self-examination report, still showing "processing."
。
.
医院提供的遗体接受表上，核酸检测为阳性、已经确诊的父亲被填上“疑似肺炎”字样。
The father, who tested positive for nucleic acid and was confirmed, was marked 'Suspected Pneumonia' on a form provided by the hospital.
李馨问医院工作人员，为什么写疑似？得到的回复是，“我们也不知道”。
Li Xin asked hospital staff, why write suspected? The response is, "we do not know."
。
.
集中收治隔离倡议。
Centralized isolation initiative.
2月1日，湖北经济学院会计学院教授夏明等八名社会人士共同呼吁：武汉现在仍有不少已确诊或大量疑似患者不能入院，面临求医难、住院难等问题，需要收到高度关注和迅速安排。
On February 1, eight members of the public, including Xia Ming, professor of accounting at the Hubei Institute of Economics, appealed: Wuhan still has many patients who have been diagnosed or suspected to be unhospitalized.
。
.
以下是来自委托夏明等人向政府提交的一线医生的建议：。
The following are the recommendations of the front-line doctors commissioned by Sharming and others to submit to the Government:
医生的逻辑和防疫的逻辑是不一样的，医生要治好每个人，但防疫是尽量少发病，尽量少一点死亡。
Doctor's logic and epidemic prevention logic is not the same, doctors to cure everyone, but vaccination is to minimize the incidence of disease, as little as possible death.
。
.
现在这种局面，有可能救每一个人么？理性一点说，不可能的。
Is it possible to save everyone in this situation? Rationally, it is impossible.
不可能在每个人身上用尽医疗资源像平时那样尽力抢救的，医疗资源是有限的。
It is impossible to use up medical resources on everyone as much as they would normally, and medical resources are limited.
。
.
但是老百姓理解不了，也不可能理性地看待。
But the common people do not understand it, nor can they treat it rationally.
以为医生是万能的，医院住进去了就没事了，怎么可能？。
Think the doctor is omnipotent, the hospital lives in to be OK, how possibly?
说实话，这个病得了，大多数简单治疗就可以，比如统一收留在酒店里隔起来，统一给药，因为都是口服的很简单，统一供应吃饭。
To tell you the truth, this disease, most simple treatment can be, such as unified shelter in the hotel block, unified delivery, because it is very simple oral, a unified supply of food.
。
.
很多小饭馆都要倒闭了，这下就应该发动他们去做盒饭，这样隔离病人是相对低廉的价格达到目的，完全免去全家隔离还要买菜做饭的问题，也免去了饭店进了好多年货都要坏在店里的担心。
Many small restaurants are going out of business, which should prompt them to cook boxed meals, so that the isolation of patients can be achieved at a relatively low price, completely obviating the need to segregate the family and buy and prepare meals, as well as the fear that many years of bad food in the restaurant would result.
。
.
然后，只需要派很少几个医护人员做好防护，挨个统计体温，一旦发现有病情急剧变化就立即联系定点医院就医，因为医院有呼吸机，而宾馆没有。
Then, just send a few health care workers to take care of the body temperature one by one and contact the designated hospital as soon as a drastic change is detected, because the hospital has a ventilator and the hotel does not.
。
.
这样的好处是与在医院里是一样的，当然也不可能每个人都救活，但这样能最大限度发挥医疗资源效能。
This benefit is the same as in the hospital, of course not everyone can save lives, but this can maximize the effectiveness of medical resources.
。
.
把所有疑似病人隔离起来，才能最有效地控制传染源，切断传播途径。
Isolating all suspected patients is the most effective way to control the source of infection and cut off the transmission route.
。
.
只有把疑似病人都隔离起来，医院的其他科室也才能正常运作，因为老百姓不会因为冠状病毒出现就不得别的病了。
Only by isolating the suspected patients can the other departments of the hospital be able to function properly, as the common people will not have to be sick because of the coronavirus.
。
.
现在我们医院的其他工作几乎处于一种半停滞的状态，正常的手术做不了，因为无法分辨是否疑似，也确诊不了，所以所有手术要按最高级别防护。
The rest of the hospital's work is now almost semi-stagnant, and normal operations cannot be performed because it is impossible to tell if there is a suspicion or not, so all operations must be protected at the highest level.
。
.
这样一台手术下来成本极高，而且大量防护用品用在防控一线（里面也有很多浪费的），所以普通手术除非救命都几乎停摆了，那么问题来了，肿瘤病人有可能这样子就转移了，骨折的就畸形愈合了，怎么办？。
Such a procedure is extremely costly, and a lot of protective equipment is used on the front line of prevention and control (and there is a lot of waste in it), so unless life-saving surgery is almost stopped, then the problem comes, the tumour patient may have shifted like this and the fracture has healed.
病人受累，医患矛盾一定愈演愈烈。
The patient is involved and the doctor-patient contradiction must become worse.
因此，我强烈建议政府：立即启动把空置的酒店变成特殊情况下收容所，避免疫情还在蔓延。
I therefore strongly recommend that the Government: immediately start turning vacant hotels into shelters in exceptional circumstances to prevent the epidemic from spreading.
。
.
2月2日，为有效控制传染源，武汉市新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎防控指挥部提出，全市各城区将对“四类人员”的集中收治和隔离工作，即对确诊的患者实行集中收治，对疑似患者实行集中隔离，对无法排除感染可能的发热患者参照疑似患者集中隔离观察，对确诊患者的密切接触者实行集中隔离观察。
To effectively control the source of infection, the Pneumonia Prevention and Control Command for the New Coronavirus Infection in Wuhan City on February 2 proposed that centralized treatment and isolation of "four categories of people," i.e. centralized treatment of confirmed patients, centralized isolation of suspected patients and centralized quarantinable observation of suspected patients with fever.
。
.
为加强集中收治隔离，2月5日，湖北省新型冠状病毒感染肺炎疫情防控指挥部提出，要加快解决床位紧张问题，做到应收尽收、应治尽治。
On February 5, the Hubei Provincial Command for the Prevention and Control of Coronavirus Infection with Pneumonia put forward the idea of speeding up the settlement of the bed-space shortage so as to ensure that all patients can receive and cure the disease.
