这主要与首尔市九老区的一家呼叫中心发生集体感染有关。
This was mainly related to a group infection at a call center in Seoul's Jiuolao district.
据韩联社10日报道，截至当天下午1时，该呼叫中心已至少有64名职员及其家属确诊感染，算上未纳入统计和接连不断的家属感染病例后，该疫点的病例人数将进一步增多。
At 1: 00 p.m., at least 64 staff members and their families had been diagnosed with the infection, adding to the number of uncounted cases and a steady stream of family infections.
中央防疫对策本部副本部长权埈郁当天表示，这些确诊病例都在呼叫中心所在楼宇的11层工作，4日起就有人出现症状。
Copy of the Central Preventive Measures Minister Jun Jun said the same day, the confirmed cases are in the call center on the 11 floors of the building, from 4 people have symptoms.
《中央日报》指出，这起集体感染或与“不戴口罩近距离工作”有关。
The China Daily said the collective infection was linked to "working up close without a mask."
九老区厅厅长李星当天向首尔市政府报告称，在11层工作的207人中，还有相当多的人尚未接受检测，迄今仅有一半受检人员的检测结果出炉，今后确诊的病例数量远不止此。
The head of the nine-storey district, Li Xing, told Seoul the same day that a significant number of 207 people working on the 11th floor had not been tested, with only half of those tested so far, and far more cases confirmed in the future.

权埈郁10日指出，首尔和京畿道地区人口密集，集体感染规模虽小，但如果持续蔓延，也有可能会发生类似新天地教会的病例剧增的情况，因此必须制定合理对策。
Kwon Jun 10 pointed out that Seoul and Gyeonggi Province densely populated areas, collective infection scale is small, but if the spread of the situation may occur, like Xintiandi Church, a sharp increase in the number of cases, must be developed reasonable response.

The center's first case, which appeared in the Luyuan area on May 8, was not a recent trip abroad or visit Taegu, nor is it a Xintiandi, the China Daily said.
据韩国国防部11日通报，当天首尔也出现了第一例军人确诊病例，该士兵的母亲曾与九老区呼叫中心的员工有过接触并已确诊感染。

为预防集体感染，韩国政府已呼吁各机关和企业积极实施远程办公，允许员工在家工作。
To prevent mass infections, the government has called on agencies and companies to aggressively implement telecommuting, allowing employees to work from home.
权埈郁强调，各机关和企业要增加“社会距离”，民众在出现发烧等异常症状时也尽量不要去上班，在家观察病情，咨询呼叫中心或前往筛查诊所接受检查。
Kun Jun Yu stressed that agencies and enterprises to increase "social distance", people in the event of fever and other abnormal symptoms also try not to go to work, observation of the disease at home, consulting the call center or going to the screening clinic for examination.
