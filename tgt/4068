我的马路我的街，希望那些赶时髦的小青年打扮得奇奇怪怪地快回来。
My street, I hope that those who follow the fashion of the young people dressed as strange quickly back.
我住的地方在衡复历史文化风貌区内，那条路原本非常安静，可是成了风貌区后，每天有人来游览，带着单反长镜头走来走去，尤其是周末，附近的马路有好几个网红店，时髦年轻人排队买冰激凌，买蛋挞，握一杯咖啡，坐在沿街的路上作思考状。
I live in a very quiet part of the historical and cultural landscape, but after becoming a scenic area, people come every day and walk around with a single lens. Especially on weekends, there are several red-net shops in the nearby road. Fashionable young people line up for ice cream, buy egg tarts, hold a cup of coffee and sit down in the street for reflection.
每到岁末，我最盼望春节到来的一条理由是，人都走了，马路空了，历史保护建筑都现出本来的面貌，我可以站到马路中央，两边法国梧桐树冠在头顶上空交叉握手，笔直的一条街，真好看，我要拍一张风景大片。
At the end of the year, one of the reasons I look forward to Spring Festival most is that people are gone, the streets are empty, historic preservation buildings are looking the way they used to be, I can stand in the middle of the road with the sycamore trees on either side of me shaking hands and shaking hands.
可是今年春节，我从沿街的窗户望出去，马路上早已如我所愿，空旷安静，整洁如洗，值班的环卫工人把每一片落叶都捡走了，可是我已经三天没有下楼，我得去买菜补仓，新冠肺炎疫情严峻，快递小哥一时半会回不来，网上订购的东西迟迟不能送。
However, this Spring Festival, I looked out the street window, the road has been as I would like, open and quiet, clean and clean, the sanitation workers on duty have picked up every piece of fallen leaves, but I have not been downstairs for three days, I have to buy vegetables to repair the acute pneumonia, express delivery Brother will not return for a while, online ordered things.
我下楼丢垃圾，走去附近的超市。
I went downstairs to throw away the rubbish and went to the nearby supermarket.
超市门口桌上有测温枪，正在结账的店员让我等一等他，超市里人不多，大家戴着口罩，默默地挑选，尽量不擦肩而过，在街上走也是，对面有人过来，这边赶紧让道，君子礼貌得不同以往。
There was a temperature gun on the table at the supermarket. The clerk who was checking out told me to wait for him. There were not many people in the supermarket.
超市里蔬菜水果应有尽有。
The supermarket has everything from vegetables to fruits.
买了很多食物，结账的时候没有人用现金，个个举起手机扫码支付，我也跟着办了张会员卡。
Buy a lot of food, check out when no one with cash, each lift mobile phone sweep code payment, I also do a membership card.
往回走，因为提着重物，感觉迈不开腿，才想起多穿了一条秋裤。
Go back, because carrying heavy things, feeling unable to move legs, just think of wearing an extra pair of autumn trousers.
额头冒汗了，戴了眼镜又戴着口罩，气要透不出了。
Sweat on the forehead, wearing glasses and wearing a mask, breathless.
路上一个行人也没有，突然委屈得眼泪“哗”地冒了出来。
There was no passer-by on the road, and suddenly tears came out of her eyes.
想起在武汉的那些每天穿戴得如太空人一般的第一线医护人员，见过一个女护士自拍让妈妈放心的视频，一层层护士服，防护服，裤子、手套、脚套、口罩、护目镜、面罩，这么穿完，他们怎么走路，怎么呼吸？是进ICU病房救人哪，还要打针，抽血，插管，上呼吸器，以及生活护理，难以想象。
It is hard to imagine how they walk and breathe after wearing a nurse's self-assured video, a layer of nurse's uniform, protective clothing, trousers, gloves, goggles, face masks, how to breathe?
天气有点阴沉，倒春寒。
It was a little overcast and cold.
等红绿灯时，一辆车也没有，我可以站到马路中央拍全景照了，可是一点拍照的心思也没有。
When the traffic lights, there is no car, I can stand in the middle of the road to take a panoramic photograph, but there is no idea to take a picture.
空荡荡的马路，商店全部闭户，每一条弄堂口都贴着白纸告示，一位老太太挽着瘪瘪的马甲袋踽踽独行，风吹起了她凌乱的白发，我认出她戴的口罩，是居委会排队登记后再到药房买来的。
The empty streets, the shops are closed, white paper notices are affixed to every lane, an old lady walks hand in hand with her trampled waistcoat bags, the wind blows up her messy white hair, and I recognize her wearing a mask, which the neighborhood committee has queued up to buy.
怎么会这样，眼泪又上来了。
How could this happen? Tears are coming back.
今年的春节确实过得不同以往，长假太长了，长到爱宅家的人无聊地用手机偷拍对面人家吊在窗台上的咸肉。
The Spring Festival is really different this year. Long vacations are so long that homeowners are bored using their mobile phones to snap bacon hanging on the windowsill opposite them.
长到想念以往街上背着单反相机长镜头的游人。
Long enough to miss the past on the street with a long camera lens visitors.
我的马路我的街，不要再那么冷清那么了无生气了，希望那些赶时髦的小青年打扮得奇奇怪怪地快回来，来摆酷、拍照、拍视频；那些小女生来，买了椰子壳装的五彩冰激凌先拍照，人戳在马路上修图，上传朋友圈；爱好热闹的朋友也来，站啤酒小店门口碰杯，喧闹，坐人家门口台阶上直播……好在前方新冠肺炎阻击战已获得阶段性成绩，全国包括湖北、武汉疫情已缓。
My street, my street, no longer so cold and lifeless, hope that the fashionable young people dressed up as strange to come back, to cool, take photos, video; the young girls, to buy coconut shell multicolored ice cream, to take pictures, poke pictures in the street, upload friends.
今天网上读到陶斯亮《为你骄傲，我的大武汉》一文，就像我24岁那年第一次读到她《一封终于发出的信》时那样，这篇文章讲常识亮观点，一如既往的有力量，令人信服又感动。
Today, I read Tao Sliang, "Pride in You, My Wuhan," as I first read her "A Letter Finally Sent" when I was 24, this article is as powerful, convincing and moving as ever as it was when I first read her "A Letter At Last."
陶斯亮在文章最后提到世界卫生组织专家在北京新闻发布会上说，当这场疫情过去，希望有机会代表世界再一次感谢武汉人民。
'When the epidemic is over, I hope to have the opportunity to thank the people of Wuhan again on behalf of the world, 'Tao said at the end of the article, referring to WHO experts at a press conference in Beijing.
她说：“艾尔沃德的话让无数人动容。
"Alvold's words touched the hearts of countless people," she said.
其实武汉人民最希望的，是他们所受的苦难，再也不要在中国上演。
In fact, Wuhan people's most hope is that their suffering, no longer staged in China.
”是的，我们再也不要流泪，不再伤心，脱下口罩正常交往，享受热腾腾的每一天。
"Yes, we no longer cry, no more sad, take off the mask normal interaction, enjoy the heat of each day.
