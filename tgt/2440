几乎无人愿意涉足成本高企的上游原材料市场都挤在产业链下游“搏命”2020年2月28日，工人们在四川祥和茂制衣口罩生产线上忙着生产口罩，保障市场供给。
Few people want to get involved in the high-cost upstream raw materials market are crowded downstream of the industrial chain "fight" February 28, 2020, workers in Xianghe Mao clothing mask production line in Sichuan busy manufacturing, to ensure the market supply.
中新社发 李建明 摄新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情仍在持续。
The new coronavirus pneumonia outbreak reported by the Chinese news agency Li Jianming continues.
口罩、防护服乃至额温枪，原本都是不起眼的小产业，面对突如其来的疫情，突然被推到了事关国计民生的风口浪尖上。
Mask, protective clothing and even frontal temperature gun, which are small industries, are suddenly pushed to the top of the national economy in the face of sudden epidemic.
在行政命令和经济效益的双重刺激下，各路人马纷纷入局，大显神通。
Under the stimulus of both administrative orders and economic benefits, passers-by have entered the game.
但面对庞大的需求缺口，仍呈供不应求之势。
But in the face of a huge demand gap, demand is still outstripping supply.
原因究竟何在？需求三天前，口腔医疗设备代理商李莉在朋友圈里发出了一张图片：霍尼韦尔头戴式口罩，一大盒25只装，售价875元。
What's the reason? Three days ago, Li Li, a dental equipment agent, sent out a picture of Honeywell wearing a face mask in a box of 25 bottles for 875 yuan.
但很快，她就把这条朋友圈删除了。
But soon she removed the circle of friends.
“不管你卖多少价，别人都会觉得你在发国难财。
"No matter how much you sell, people will think you are losing money in your country.
”李莉说，“反正一共也没多少钱，算了，想想没有必要。
'There's not a lot of money in all, anyway, 'said Lily.
”疫情发生前，3M、霍尼韦尔的口罩，单片售价仅有五元人民币左右。
Before the outbreak, 3M and Honeywell's masks were selling for about Rmb5 a piece.
普通的一次性外科口罩更便宜，单片折算下来仅有四角到一元。
Common disposable surgical masks are cheaper, with only four cents to one dollar converted into a single piece.
随着疫情发展，价格开始飙升，都出现了五到十倍的涨幅。
As the epidemic unfolded, prices began to soar, all five to ten times higher.
李莉能拿到口罩，也得益于职业便利：口腔医疗行业对口罩历来有需求。
Li Li can get a mask, but also benefit from professional convenience: oral medicine industry has a long-term demand for masks.
李莉之前的老东家在德国有一条小型口罩生产线，专供本行业使用。
Li Li's former employer had a small mask production line in Germany for her industry.
因为产量实在不起眼，平常都没人注意。
Because the output is really unremarkable, usually nobody pays attention to.
但随着新冠疫情的发展，突然成了香饽饽，订单如雪片般飞来。
But with the development of the new crown, suddenly became a hot spot, orders came like snowflakes.
李莉告诉中国新闻周刊，疫情之前，相对国内，欧美生产的口罩因为价格太高，没有任何竞争力可言。
Li Li told China News Weekly that before the outbreak, U. S. and European-made masks were too expensive to compete with the rest of the country.
这一次情况彻底翻转了过来。
This time the situation turned upside down.
“国外的华人们都在各显神通，能搞多少搞多少。
"The Chinese people abroad are all on the show and can do as much as they can.
”因为订单太多，实在生产不过来，很多海外生产线都停止了接单。
Many overseas production lines have stopped receiving orders because there are so many orders that they cannot be produced.
除了口罩，防护服也成了紧俏产品。
In addition to masks, protective clothing has become a hot product.
2月4日，北京赢冠口腔医疗科技股份有限公司（以下简称“赢冠科技”）开始复工，调整设备，于2月7日搭建完成了一个防护服生产车间。
On February 4, Beijing Winning Oral and Medical Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Winning Technology") started work, adjusted equipment, and completed a protective clothing production workshop on February 7.
原本，北京市内有资质的防护服生产企业只有位于平谷区的邦维高科一家。
Originally, Beijing has qualified protective clothing manufacturers only located in the Pinggu area of the Bong Wei Gaoke family.
但随着疫情发展，防护服供应吃紧。
But as the epidemic unfolded, the supply of protective clothing became tight.
国家药监部门开放了在疫情期间医疗器械应急备案的政策。
The State Administration of Pharmaceutical Supervision opened the policy of emergency medical equipment filing during the epidemic.
原本主营业务为义齿制造的赢冠科技就是首轮获批的企业之一。
Originally the main business for denture manufacturing win-win technology is one of the first round of approved enterprises.
赢冠科技董事长郭大鹏向中国新闻周刊透露，目前，公司的防护服生产仍不稳定，取决于原材料的供应情况，日产量在100-300件之间浮动。
Guo Dapeng, chairman of Winning Technologies, told China News Weekly that the company's production of protective clothing is still unstable and fluctuates between 100 and 300 units a day, depending on the availability of raw materials.
放眼全国，赢冠科技的“转型”只是一个缩影。
Across the country, the "transformation" of winning technology is just a microcosm.
随着疫情的发展，五菱、比亚迪、富士康等企业都纷纷入局生产口罩。
With the development of the epidemic, Wuling, BYD, Foxconn and other enterprises have entered the Bureau to produce masks.
五菱还打出了“人民需要什么，五菱就造什么”的标语，在网络上收获了一波好感。
Wuling also hit the slogan "What the people need, Wuling what to build," and gained a wave of goodwill on the Internet.
大中小型民企接连入场，让人们一阵欢呼。
Large, small and medium-sized private enterprises admission, let people cheer.
但物资短缺的问题，真的能够就此迎刃而解吗？瓶颈根据业内人士介绍，防护服和口罩，生产各有不同的难处。
But can the problem of shortages really be solved? Bottlenecks vary according to industry sources, protective clothing and masks.
防护服对生产场地有严格要求，一般要求在10万级洁净车间生产。
Protective clothing for the production site has strict requirements, general requirements in the 100,000 clean workshop production.
如果服装企业临时新建洁净厂房，投入不小，时间上也未必来得及。
If the clothing enterprises temporary construction of new clean workshop, no small investment, the time may not be too late.
这个门槛导致了医用防护服生产企业的稀缺。
This threshold has led to a scarcity of medical protective clothing manufacturers.
所以常见的解决之道是，直接借用药企的车间改造成医用防护服生产车间。
So the common solution is to directly borrow the workshop of pharmaceutical companies into a medical protective clothing production workshop.
这也是主营业务为义齿的赢冠科技能够入局，而许多中小纺织企业却难有用武之地的原因所在。
This is the main business for the win-win technology can enter the board, and many small and medium-sized textile enterprises are difficult to use the reasons.

图/受访者供图此外，和传统服装制造相似，防护服生产也属于人力密集型工种，自动化水平较低，涉及到制版、裁剪、缝纫、封边、压条、上拉链等一系列复杂工序。
Chart / Interviewee: In addition, similar to traditional garment manufacturing, the production of protective clothing is a labour-intensive type of work with a low level of automation involving a complex series of processes such as plate preparation, tailoring, sewing, sealing, stamping and zipping.
衣服制成后，还需要经过24小时的辐照灭菌流程。
After the garment is made, also needs to go through 24-hour irradiation sterilization process.
赢冠科技目前共有40名工人，满负荷运作下，平均日产量也仅在两百套左右。
Winning technology now has 40 workers and is operating at full capacity with an average daily output of only about 200 units.
但在蔓延的疫情下，随着封城封路政策的实施，企业招工成了难题。
But in the spread of the epidemic, with the implementation of the closure policy, enterprise recruitment has become a difficult problem.
郭大鹏告诉中国新闻周刊，赢冠科技的员工虽然了解医疗生产标准，却不会制成衣。
Guo Dapeng told China News Weekly that workers at Winning Technologies, though aware of medical production standards, would not be made into clothes.
因此公司只好开出600元一天的价格，才找来了十几个裁缝，和员工们形成技术互补。
So the company had to offer 600 yuan a day price, just found a dozen tailors, and the staff formed a technical complementarity.
早在2月9日，邦维高科为了招徕熟练工，也开出了高价招聘的启事。

Graph / International Talent Recruitment Platform Public Number But these questions are technical and essentially solvable.
随着各地逐步开始复工，情况立刻得到了改善。
With the gradual resumption of work everywhere, the situation immediately improved.
根据前不久国新办发布会公布的数据，1月28日，全国医用防护服日产量还不到1万套，生产企业不到20家。
According to figures released at a recent press conference, on January 28, fewer than 10,000 medical protection suits were produced nationwide, and fewer than 20 production enterprises.
现在扩产转产达到了50多家，还有近百家已经陆续获得资质。
Now more than 50 production expansion into production, and nearly 100 have been qualified.
根据估算，目前医用防护服保供湖北的数量已经超过了200多万件，全国日产量已经达到了20多万套。
It is estimated that the number of medical protective clothing supplied to Hubei has exceeded 2 million pieces, and the daily output has reached more than 200,000.
足以满足需求。
Sufficient to meet demand.
口罩则完全是另一种光景。
Mask masks are completely different.
制约口罩产量的瓶颈不在于技术和人力。
The bottleneck that restricts mask production is not technology and manpower.
深圳医疗器械行业协会（以下简称“深圳医协”）副秘书长焦仪给了中国新闻周刊一组数据：市面上主流的口罩机，一小时的节拍是6000只，旧机型一小时的节拍是3600-4000只。
The Shenzhen Medical Device Industry Association (hereinafter referred to as "Shenzhen Medical Association") Deputy Secretary-General Jiaoyi gave China News Weekly a set of data: the mainstream mask machine on the market, the beat of an hour is 6000, the beat of the old model is 3600-4000.
也就是说，倘若不计算灭菌和解析期，一个口罩机平均一小时便能量产5000只口罩。
That is, without sterilization and parsing, a mask machine can produce an average of 5,000 masks per hour.
自动化程度很高。
There is a high degree of automation.
但口罩生产，难在关键原材料之一的熔喷布产量受限。
The problem with mask production, however, is that production of one of the key raw materials is limited.
熔喷布的主要原料为聚丙烯，是一种纤维直径在2微米左右的超细静电纤维布，可有效捕捉粉尘。
The main raw material is polypropylene, is a fiber diameter of about 2 micron of ultrafine electrostatic fiber cloth, can effectively capture dust.
含有病毒的飞沫靠近熔喷布后，会被静电吸附在表面，无法透过。
The droplets containing the virus will be electrostatically adsorbed onto the surface and will not be able to penetrate.
普通的医用外科口罩，一个要使用一层熔喷布。
Common medical surgical masks, one with a layer of molten cloth.
至于更高规格的N95，一个口罩要用掉至少3层熔喷布。
For a higher-specification N95, it takes at least three layers of molten cloth for a mask.
因此是生产过滤功能口罩的必要原料。
Therefore, it is the necessary raw material for producing filter function masks.
焦仪向中国新闻周刊介绍，熔喷布的主要材料是聚丙烯材料做成的高熔指纤维。
The focal point told China News Weekly that the main material of the melt-jet fabric is high-melt fiber made of polypropylene.
而一吨高熔指纤维能够生产成品熔喷布 900公斤，产率在90%左右。
And a ton of high-melt fiber can produce the finished product melt-jet fabric 900 kg, the yield is about 90%.
金联创数据显示，2019年高熔指纤维全年产量为88万吨，即使全部换算成熔喷布，也才79.2万吨，远远小于防疫工作中口罩产能所需量。
In 2019, Kim said, the annual production of high-melting-finger fibres was 880,000 tonnes, or 792,000 tonnes, far less than needed for immunization.
近年来，熔喷布的市场一直处于稳定水平，只有在面对例如SARS、埃博拉、禽流感暴发等突发公共卫生安全事件时，才会出现短暂爆发。
The market for melts has been stable in recent years, with only brief outbreaks in the face of sudden public health security incidents such as SARS, Ebola and avian influenza outbreaks.
企业趋利，市场容量有限，平时自然不会增产。
Enterprises to profit, the market capacity is limited, usually will not increase production.
据了解，全国能够生产符合医用熔喷布BFE95以上的企业大约有100家，日产量约100吨。
It is understood that there are about 100 enterprises in the country that are capable of producing BFE95 or more, with a daily production capacity of about 100 tons.
根据深圳医协的调研，减去实际生产中的损耗，一吨熔喷布大概能做90万-100万只医用外科口罩。
According to Shenzhen Medical Association research, minus the actual losses in production, a ton of spray cloth can do about 900,000 to 1m medical surgical masks.
100吨，也就是全国一天的医用熔喷布总产量，能做9千万只口罩。
The country's total production of 100 tons of medical spray, or 100 tons a day, can make 90 million masks.
根据口罩机的生产速率反推可得，100吨熔喷布，仅可以供750台口罩机工作24小时。
Based on the Mask Maker's production rate, 100 tons of spray can be used for only 750 respirators for 24 hours.
但根据《中国企业家杂志》早先一篇报道，仅盈合科技一家口罩机生产厂商（也是临时转型，其原本主营业务为锂电池制造装备）的接单量就已经达到了1700台。
But according to an earlier report in China Entrepreneur magazine, only one manufacturer of respirators, Yinghe Technology, which used to manufacture equipment for lithium batteries, has ordered 1,700 masks.
上游原材料不足，下游设备供应却泛滥，产业链难免发生扭曲。
Upstream raw materials are insufficient, downstream equipment supplies are overflowing, the industrial chain is inevitably distorted.
2020年2月27日，江苏省苏州太仓市双凤镇一家汽车配件模具研发企业人员对即将出厂的本体口罩机生产设备进行出厂前验收。
February 27, 2020, Suzhou Taicang City, Jiangsu Province, a car parts mold development and development enterprise personnel will be out of the production equipment of the body mask machine before the factory acceptance.
该公司2月初以来根据市场需求进行研发调整，研发设计日生产能力达14万只的本体口罩机。
The company since the beginning of February according to market demand for research and development, design and design capacity of 140,000 Ontology Mask Machine.
中新社发钟鑫旺 摄一言以蔽之，医用熔喷布的现有产量，远远满足不了口罩生产设备的产能。
In a word, the current production of medical spray cloth, far from meeting the capacity of the mask production equipment.
那么，既然需求存在，有利可图，为什么企业不进军上游，直接参与熔喷布制造，都在一窝蜂地投资口罩生产线呢？首先是经济因素。
So, since demand exists profitably, why don't companies go upstream and directly participate in the manufacture of melts and invest heavily in the mask production line? First, economic factors.
相对于搭建口罩的生产线，参与制造熔喷布所需支付的代价实在太大。
The cost of participating in the manufacture of the spray is too high compared to the production line for masks.
生产熔喷布的设备，国产价格大约在500万元人民币左右，进口设备则在1000万元人民币以上。
The domestic price of the equipment for producing the spray cloth is about RMB 5 million, and the import equipment is over RMB10 million.
与之相对的是，市面上常见的平面一拖二口罩生产线，即便价格近期有所上涨，但装配下来也仅需不到60万元。
In contrast, the common planar mask production line, even if prices have risen recently, will cost less than $600,000 to assemble.
考虑到疫情很可能在夏季到来时结束，中小企业自然更有动力进入下游市场“搏一搏”，而不愿涉足成本高企的上游原材料市场。
Given that the epidemic is likely to end in the summer, small and medium-sized enterprises are naturally more motivated to enter the downstream market rather than enter the high-cost upstream raw materials market.
其次是学习成本。
The second is the cost of learning.
设备购买、入厂、调试、培训的一系列过程都需要时间，长则三个月，短也要一个月。
The process of equipment purchase, entry, commissioning and training takes time, ranging from three months to one month.
而业内共识是，一个月后，疫情很可能已经过去。
The consensus in the industry is that a month from now, the epidemic is likely to be over.
这直接导致，即便是不以盈利为目的的国企央企也无法下定决心跑步入局。
As a direct result, even state-owned and unprofitable state-owned enterprises can't make up their minds to get into the game.
乱象熙熙攘攘，皆为利往。
The bustle of chaos, all for the benefit.
供需矛盾下，乱象自显。
Demand and supply conflict, chaos self-evident.
李莉告诉中国新闻周刊，目前市场上口罩货源极为稀缺，就连她这种专业从事医疗器械代理的员工只能零散拿到几盒。
Li Li told China News Weekly that there was a dearth of masks on the market, and that even her professional medical-device proxies received only a few scattered boxes.
“也是朋友给的一些库底。
"Some of the coffers my friends gave me.
”李莉的朋友圈里也有那种号称“一万个起订”的微商。
"Li Li's circle of friends also has the sort of micro-quotient called" 10,000 subscriptions. "
“其实他也没有货源，也是找人拼单。
"In fact, he did not have supplies, is also looking for a collage.
拼成了拿的残次品，没拼成就直接砍单。
Scrap into a piece of defective goods, no effort to achieve direct beheading.
”李莉说，“你觉得反正退了钱，你没什么损失，其实相当于帮别人做了老鼠仓。
"You think you have nothing to lose by returning the money anyway," Li Li said.
”不久前大火的一篇自媒体稿件《倒爷，骗子，庄家：我在额温计百亿黑市里的惊心24小时》也揭露出了额温枪市场乱象的冰山一角——大部分都是以捐赠为名倒买倒卖额温枪，市场内流动的资金数以亿计，唯独没几个人真正能见到现货。
A recent fire story from The Lord, Cheater, The Twenty-Fourth Hour in the Billion Dollar Black Market has also exposed the tip of the iceberg - most of it in the name of donations, with hundreds of millions of dollars circulating in the market, few of whom actually see it in stock.
熔喷布自然也不能免俗。
Melting cloth is not immune to vulgarity.
焦仪向中国新闻周刊透露，早在1月初，深圳一家企业，就开始大量囤积熔喷布。
As early as the beginning of January, a Shenzhen company began to hoard a large quantity of fuzz.
随着疫情发展，熔喷布价格很快节节高升，原价每吨价格在18000、19000元左右的熔喷布，逐渐加码到一吨十万，再到二十万。
As the epidemic unfolded, the price of melts rose rapidly. The original price was around 18,000 yuan and 19,000 yuan per ton, gradually increasing to 100,000 tons and 200,000.
尽管价格高企，但许多被政府征用的口罩厂为了完成硬性任务，也只好不计成本地购买。
Despite high prices, many government-requisitioned mask factories are buying them for hard tasks at no cost.
飙升的成本，直接反映到终端消费者的价格上。
Surging costs are directly reflected in the prices of end-users.
“摊下来，每个至少要涨一块钱。
"Stretch it out and let it go up by at least a dollar each.
”上游的原材料不足，但中小企业却还是一窝蜂涌进下游，开始大量铺设生产线，对此趋势，焦仪表示担忧：“物料不够，保证不了生产，（这些设备）就相当于一堆废铁。
Upstream, where raw materials are scarce, small and medium-sized companies are rushing downstream to lay large numbers of production lines, a trend that worries cokers: "There is not enough material to make it, and [the equipment] amounts to a pile of scrap metal."
”至于早先在网络爆红的五菱、比亚迪、富士康这类大型企业，不仅现金储备能力强，就算没有疫情，员工日常也有对口罩的需求。
As for big companies such as Wuling, BYD and Foxconn, which were popular online, not only do they have cash reserves, but they also need masks on a daily basis, even in the absence of outbreaks.
搭建口罩生产线，无非相当于外购转自造。
Mask production line, nothing more than outsourcing to build.
反映到财务报表上，原本的费用项还可以计为资产项，成本反而降低了。
Reflected in the financial statements, the original cost items can also be recorded as assets, but the cost has been reduced.
为了缓和资源错配的状况，早在疫情开始之初，深圳医疗器械行业协会一直呼吁实施分级接单制度。
To alleviate the mismatch of resources, the Shenzhen Medical Device Industry Association has been calling for the implementation of a tiered order system since the beginning of the epidemic.
所谓分级接单制度，指的是生产设备、原材料应按照相关合同和订单，优先供给有资质的医疗器械企业，以遏制中间商囤积居奇的行为。
The so-called tiered order system means that production equipment and raw materials should be given priority to qualified medical device enterprises in accordance with relevant contracts and orders, so as to curb hoarding by middlemen.
或许是业内人士的呼吁起到了效果。
Perhaps the industry's calls have paid off.
2月21日，国务院客户端小程序上线了“重点医疗防控物资生产工序对接专区”，原材料的供求双方，都可以在专区内上报供求信息并搜索匹配。
February 21, the State Council client side procedures on the line "Key medical prevention and control material production process docking area," the supply and demand of raw materials, both sides, can report within the sub-district supply and demand information and search match.
为了遏制行业过快跃进，一些地方政府也逐步收紧了医疗物资的快速审批政策。
To curb the industry's rapid leaps forward, some local governments have also gradually tightened their fast-track approval policies for medical supplies.
2月25日，广东省药品监督管理局办公室发文，将新冠肺炎疫情防控应急响应级别由重大突发公共卫生事件一级响应已调整为二级响应，并且宣布，自3月1日起，各市停止全省疫情防控所需第二类医疗器械应急备案工作。
On February 25, the Office of the Guangdong Provincial Drug Administration issued a communication changing the emergency response level from a major public health emergency to a secondary response, and announced that, as of March 1, the municipalities would stop emergency recording of type II medical devices needed for epidemic prevention and control throughout the province.
而对于已经备案的企业，也要加强监督检查，原材料性能不达标的，不得继续生产、销售。
For those enterprises that have already registered, supervision and inspection should be strengthened, and those whose raw material performance is not up to standard may not continue to produce and sell.
未来与反思在不少人的观念中，医疗器械行业在这一轮疫情中赚的盆满钵满，但焦仪认为，这种猜测并不全面。
FUTURE AND REFLECTION In the minds of many people, the medical-device industry has made a lot of money in this round of epidemics, but the coker believes this speculation is not comprehensive.
首先，尽管部分医疗器械，如口罩、防护服、诊断试剂等防疫产品的产量出现了爆发式增长，但相应地，春节期间的用工成本，以及原材料成本的也都同步发生了大幅上涨；其次，医院将人力主要集中在对新冠肺炎的防护与救治，势必忽略其他方面。
First, while production of some medical devices, such as masks, protective clothing, and diagnostic reagents, has exploded, so have labor costs and raw-material costs during the Spring Festival. Second, hospitals have concentrated their manpower on the prevention and treatment of pneumonia at the expense of others.
部分与防疫无关的药品和医疗器械可能暂停购入，公立医院的集中采购可能也会暂缓；最后，医疗器械外贸出口受不可抗力停摆。
Some drugs and medical devices not related to epidemic prevention may be suspended, centralized procurement of public hospitals may also be suspended; and finally, foreign trade in medical devices may be halted by force majeure.
以上种种因素，都抵消了防疫产品销售带来的利好。
All these factors have offset the positive effects of the marketing of epidemic prevention products.
郭大鹏也向中国新闻周刊表示，赢冠科技光是搭建生产设备、购买原材料就已经投入了将近三百万人民币，而且生产出的头几批防护服都是直接捐赠给了北京卫计委，再由后者统一调拨给各家医院。
Guo Dapeng also told China News Weekly that Winning Technologies had invested nearly three million yuan in building production equipment and buying raw materials, and that the first batches of protective clothing were donated directly to the Beijing Health and Planning Commission, which then allocated them uniformly to hospitals.
“我们其实从一开始也没指望靠这个赚钱。
"We didn't expect to make money out of it in the first place.
”郭大鹏坦言。
"Guo Dapeng confessed.
焦仪认为，从长远来考量，新冠疫情对医疗器械行业来说既是考验，也是改变的机会。
In the long run, the new crown is both a test and an opportunity for change for the medical device industry, she said.
多年来，医疗器械生产的特点是小批量，多品种，因此自动化水平一直处于低端，更是远远落后于手机、汽车制造、快消品等产业。
Over the years, medical equipment production is characterized by small quantities, many varieties, so the level of automation has been at the low end, is far behind mobile phones, car manufacturing, fast disappearing products and other industries.
正常时期下，医疗器械企业的产能，严重受制于劳动力数量和人员技术水平的高低。
Under normal times, the production capacity of medical device enterprises is severely restricted by the quantity of labor and the level of technical level of personnel.
但当真正的疫情到来之时，人们发现，封城封路政策限制了人员流动，劳动力供应不足的问题开始全国各地暴露。
But when the real epidemic came, it was discovered that the closure policy limited the movement of people and that the problem of inadequate labour supply began to be exposed throughout the country.
因此在焦仪看来，医疗器械的智能制造、自动化生产势在必行。
Therefore, in the focal point view, the intelligent manufacture of medical equipment, automatic production is imperative.
“国家应该重视医疗器械这个小行业，对于产业创新、产品研发、新技术应用、智能生产等方面的日常支持应该进一步加大。
"The state should attach importance to medical devices as a small industry, and daily support for industrial innovation, product development, application of new technologies and intelligent production should be further increased."
”此外，目前来看，虽然国内的疫情得到了有效控制，但国际上却不容乐观。
And, while the domestic epidemic is now under effective control, it is no cause for international optimism.
如伊朗、日本、韩国、意大利等国，都出现了新冠肺炎迅速扩散的苗头。
Countries such as Iran, Japan, South Korea and Italy are showing signs of rapid spread of pneumonia.
倘若东京奥运会如期举办，全球对防疫物资的需求只会持续加大。
If the Tokyo Olympic Games are held on schedule, global demand for epidemic prevention materials will only continue to increase.
焦仪认为，考虑到中国在抗击新冠肺炎方面累积的经验，接下来，中国的防疫物资的供应除了满足国内的需求外，很可能会接到大量的国际订单。
Given China's accumulated experience in fighting pneumonia, China is likely to receive a large number of international orders in addition to meeting domestic demand, she said.
这对于企业来讲，同样既是考验，也是机会。
This is also a test and an opportunity for an enterprise.
但医疗器械行业的特殊之处在于，法律和制度门槛较高。
But the medical device industry is unique in that the legal and institutional barriers are high.
出口境外的医疗器械，取得出口资质和进口国产品认证都需要一定时间。
It takes time to export medical equipment abroad, obtain export qualification and certify the products of importing countries.
即便疫情之下，特事特办，但其中也必然会涉及诸多问题。
Even if the epidemic situation, special operations, but it will inevitably involve a number of issues.
“这些工作依然需要我们的政府来支持协助。
"These efforts still need the support of our governments.
”焦仪说。
