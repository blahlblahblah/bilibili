22.02.2020本文字数：4153，阅读时长大约8分钟导读：从发热人员排查分类，到集中隔离“清零”，再到确诊“清零”，社区无疑是最为核心的战场，也承受着巨大的压力。
2008-09-20 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 22: 30 22: 55, with a reading of about 8 minutes: from the heat boomers sorting, to the centralized isolation of "zero," to the diagnosis of "zero," the community is undoubtedly the most central battlefield, but also under tremendous pressure.
作者 | 第一财经李澄晚“李老师病情已经减轻了，并由重症救治医院转入方舱医院了，但是核酸检测仍未转阴，还在等待进一步治疗。
"Miss Li has been relieved and transferred from the intensive care hospital to the Fang She Hospital, but the nucleic acid test is still positive and is awaiting further treatment.
”2月19日，李老师的爱人刘女士告诉第一财经1℃记者。
On Feb. 19, Ms. Liu, Miss Li's wife, told First Finance 1 ° C reporter.
2月19日，是武汉针对新冠肺炎的全市拉网清底大排查行动的最后一天。
February 19, Wuhan is the new crown pneumonia in the city of the last day of the clean-up campaign.
这对众多基层社区和社区工作人员来说，无疑是一次大考。
It was a big test for many grass-roots community and community workers.
从1月下旬最初的发热人员排查分类，到2月初的集中隔离“清零”，再到新总攻目标确诊“清零”，社区无疑是最为核心的战场，也承受着巨大的压力。
From the initial census of feverish people in late January to the concentrated isolation of "zero" in early February, and then to the diagnosis of "zero" new general attack targets, the community is undoubtedly the most central battlefield, but also under tremendous pressure.
这一天，武汉市新洲区某社区副书记李欢长舒了一口气。
This day, Wuhan Xinzhou District, a community deputy secretary Li Huan Chang sigh of relief.
在2月17日至2月19日的拉网式大排查之下，她所在社区已全部清零了“密切接触者”，“完成了一项长期而艰巨的任务”。
Her community has been completely cleared of "close contacts" and "has accomplished a long and arduous task" under a pull-in sweep from February 17 to February 19.
但李欢他们还是得继续面对人手紧缺、防护物资不足等现实问题，打起精神继续奔走于各个封闭的小区，直到疫情警报彻底消除。
But Li Huan they still have to continue to face the shortage of personnel, inadequate protective materials and other practical problems, and continue to keep up with the spirit of the closed communities until the eradication of the epidemic alert.
无力调拨的资源现年56岁的李老师，系武汉市某区的高中数学老师。
Ms. Li, 56, is a senior high school math teacher in a district of Wuhan.
今年春节前，李老师身体持续发烧，遂前往医院治疗。
Before the Spring Festival this year, Miss Li continued to have a fever and went to hospital for treatment.
1月24日，据CT诊断报告单显示，他被确诊为疑似新冠肺炎，然而医院却没有床位收治。
On 24 January, according to a CT diagnostic report, he was diagnosed with suspected pneumonia, yet the hospital had no beds.
彼时，与李老师一样，武汉市内的发热病人持续暴增，很多发热门诊人满为患。
At that time, like Miss Li, fever patients in Wuhan City continued to surge, many fever clinics overcrowded.
1℃记者曾前往武汉市红十字医院探访发现，由于等不到床位，有的患者还睡在医院大厅的长条凳上。
A visit to Wuhan Red Cross Hospital found some patients were still sleeping on benches in the hospital lobby because they could not wait for beds.
李老师拍CT的当天，武汉市疫情防控指挥部发布第7号公告称，为解决发热门诊等候时间长、床位安排不及时等问题，全面实行发热市民分级分类就医制度。
On the same day that Mr. Li filmed the CT, the Wuhan Anti-epidemic Command issued Notice No. 7, saying that in order to solve the problem of long waiting time and untimely bedspace arrangement in the fever clinic, a comprehensive implementation of the classification of fever citizens medical treatment system.
彼时，武汉市要求全员排查发热病人，而这项排查重任就落在了基层社区头上，“由全市各社区负责，全面排查所服务辖区发热病人（含已就医和未就医市民），并送社区医疗中心对病情进行筛选、分类。
At the time, Wuhan required full-time screening of febrile patients, and the onus fell on grass-roots communities to "conduct a comprehensive survey of febrile patients (both hospitalized and untreated) in the areas served, and to refer them to community health centres for screening and classification."
”据上述7号公告，“对于不需要到发热门诊就诊的病人，由各社区落实在家居家观察，社区负责做好市民居家观察服务工作。
"For patients who do not need to visit a fever clinic, home-based home observation is implemented by the community, which is responsible for the home-based observation service," the notice said.
”1月24日，武汉市疫情防控指挥部又发布第8号公告，“为解决市民居家出行不便等问题，全市紧急征集6000台出租车，分配给中心城区。
On January 24, the Wuhan Anti-epidemic Command issued a notice No. 8, "To solve the problem of inconvenient travel for residents, the city urgently solicited 6,000 taxis for distribution to the central city.
每个社区3-5台，由社区居委会统一调度使用……社区居委会为生活不便居民上门免费提供送餐、送菜、送药等居家服务。
Each community 3-5, by the community neighborhood committee unified dispatch use...... Community neighborhood committee provides free food delivery, food delivery, medicine and other home-based services for residents with difficult living conditions.
”据公开资料显示，武汉市中心城区有1100多个社区。
More than 1,100 communities live in downtown Wuhan, according to open sources.
这意味着，这样一群没有医疗经验的社区工作者站到了疫情防控的第一线。
This means that such a group of community workers without medical experience has come to the forefront of epidemic prevention and control.
但3至5台的调度用车，对于上万人的社区来说，可谓是僧多粥少。
But three to five dispatching cars, for tens of thousands of people in the community, is nothing short of atherosclerosis.
1℃记者此前深入多个社区调查发现，一些上万人的大社区，工作人员却仅有10人左右，他们既要全面排查发热病人，有确诊患者及时送往医疗中心，还要落实发热人员居家观察。
A survey of communities found that tens of thousands of people work in large communities with only about 10 workers who have to thoroughly screen for febrile patients, send confirmed patients to medical centers in a timely manner, and carry out home observation of fever sufferers.
住不进医院的李老师，那段时间只能回家“居家隔离”治疗。
Mr. Li, who could not be admitted to the hospital, had to go home for "home isolation" treatment.
但居家隔离治疗被认为是疫情传播的一大隐患，因为患者在家成为一大传染源，家属在一旁照顾又增加了传染风险，这也给社区防控工作带来极大压力。
However, home-based seclusion is considered a major risk for the spread of the epidemic, as patients become a major source of infection at home, and family care increases the risk of infection, which also puts considerable strain on community control efforts.
由于有些社区居民较多，居家隔离治疗人员较多，社区人员每日两次上门检测体温、以及配送生活物资，如此一来，既增加他们的接触风险，又增加工作任务。
The higher number of residents in some communities, the higher number of home-based isolators, the twice-daily home temperature testing of community members and the distribution of household items increase their exposure and tasks.
“我们的防护物资也不够，上门量体温需要防护服、护目镜等设备。
"We don't have enough protective equipment. We need protective clothing and goggles to measure our body temperature.
”武汉市区一位社区人员告诉1℃记者，后来小区有新冠肺炎病例了，大家也不愿意开楼栋门了，上门监测体温也比较困难。
A local community official told reporters at 1º C that there had been a case of pneumonia in the neighborhood and people were reluctant to open the door, making it difficult to monitor the temperature.
最大的困难还是送医。
The biggest difficulty is getting a doctor.
武汉市黄鹤楼街道西厂口社区86岁的老人冯翼纯早在2月8日就通过CT拍片显示为疑似新冠肺炎患者，此后通过核酸检测确诊。
The 86-year-old Feng Yichun, 86, of Xichangkou District, Yellow Crane Tower Street, Wuhan, was diagnosed with a nucleic acid test as early as February 8.
在家隔离治疗2两天后，最终被医院收治。
After two days of isolation at home, he was eventually admitted to hospital.
在冯翼纯老人确诊之后隔离在家时，西厂口社区人员告诉1℃记者，老人的家属把病情检查结果拿过来之后，社区就已第一时间加急报给上一级的黄鹤楼街道，“我们是直接接触到这些病人，心里也是很着急，也不清楚上级情况，但是程序是这样走，我们也没有办法。
"We were in direct contact with these patients, we were in a great hurry and we didn't know the situation of our superiors, but there was nothing we could do," he told reporters at 1 ℃.
”据1℃记者调查，社区一方面无法尽快落实医院床位，另一方面又无医疗能力进行救治，只能不断地登记信息、安抚病人家属情绪，并“小心翼翼”地催促上级街道，如此周而复始。
The community, unable to find hospital beds as soon as possible and unable to provide medical treatment, is constantly checking in information, calming patients' families and urging street leaders "carefully," according to a report.
黄鹤楼街道回复1℃记者称，确诊新冠肺炎患者，轻症送往方舱医院，重症送往定点救治医院，“像冯翼纯这样的确诊重症患者必须送到定点医院救治，床位名额则由市里统一调拨。
"Confirmed cases of Newly Coronary Pneumonia were sent to Fang Cao Hospital for serious cases," said the reporter. "Cases like Feng Yongchun must be sent to designated hospitals for treatment, and beds should be allocated centrally by the city.
”据1℃记者调查了解，床位的调拨权在武汉市疫情防控指挥部手中，患者入住医院的床位名额成为“大锅饭”，一旦有空缺下来，各区各街道极力争取，都想争吃这口锅的粮食。
According to a survey conducted by reporters, the allocation of beds is in the hands of Wuhan city's epidemic prevention and control command. The number of beds available for patients in hospitals has become "big pot rice.
“我们很揪心、很痛苦的是，已经确诊的和很多疑似的病人没有住进指定医院救治，无法及时到达医院得到很好救治，形成了救治的‘堰塞湖’。
"We were very worried, very painful, has been diagnosed and many suspected patients did not live in designated hospitals, can not reach the hospital in time to get good treatment, formed a treatment of 'Yan Sehu'.
”2月5日晚间，在新闻发布会上，武汉市人大常委会主任、市委副书记胡立山承认这一“堰塞湖”的存在。
In the evening of February 5, at a press conference, Wuhan city Standing Committee chief Hu Lishan, deputy secretary of the municipal committee, acknowledged the existence of the "quake lake.
被抵触的隔离李欢2014年加入社区工作，一直担任副书记，每个月仅有2300元到手的工资，工作这么久以来，第一次遇到此次疫情，着实让社区人员措手不及。
The clashing quarantined Li Huan, who joined the community in 2014, has been working as a deputy secretary, earning only 2,300 yuan a month. For the first time in such a long time, community members were taken aback.
在经历过失败的居家隔离之后，许多确诊、疑似人员家属最终需要进行定点隔离。
After experiencing failed residential isolation, many families of diagnosed and suspected persons eventually need to be targeted for isolation.
然而，劝解居民前往隔离点，却并不是件容易的事情。
However, it is not easy to persuade residents to go to the isolation point.
李欢所在的社区拥有2000余户，上万名居民的庞大社区，可是社区仅有10名工作人员，劝解隔离工作消耗掉了他们大量的时间和精力。
Li's community, with more than 2,000 families and tens of thousands of residents, has only 10 workers, and the effort to persuade them to separate consumes a lot of time and effort.
据李欢介绍，劝解隔离有一个十分困难的前提，就是有不少与确诊、疑似以及发热人员接触的家属始终认为自己身体“没问题”，“他们还总是担心隔离点不安全”。
According to Li, one of the most difficult prerequisites for segregation is that many families who come into contact with diagnosed, suspected and febrile people always think their bodies are "OK" and that "they are always worried that the quarantine is unsafe."
小区居民王平和孙莲花系一对夫妻，居住于李欢所在辖区。
Wang Ping and Sun Lianhua, residents of the district, live in Li Huan's district.
这对王氏夫妇的女儿女婿是疑似新冠肺炎患者，已被送往医院治疗。
The couple's daughter-in-law, suspected of having pneumonia in the new crown, was taken to hospital for treatment.
在女儿女婿被送往医院救治之后，王氏夫妇独自带着七个月大的外孙在家中。
After her son-in-law was taken to hospital for treatment, the Wangs were home alone with their seven-month-old grandson.
“一开始在排查返乡人员时，我们还不晓得王平家到底有多少人，他们既不理会微信群里的工作消息，也未如实告知家人的去向。
"At first, when we checked the returnees, we didn't know how many of the Wang Ping family there were. They paid no attention to the news of the work in the group nor did they tell their families exactly where they had gone.
”李欢说。
"said Li Huan.
之后社区人员才在排查过程中进一步发现，原来王氏夫妇还在家中，且带着尚在哺乳期的外孙。
Only after the community members in the screening process further discovered that the original Wang couple is still at home, and with the breast-feeding grandson.
社区工作人员多次进行电话规劝，但王氏夫妇并不愿理睬，他们还将网格员的电话号码和微信均拉黑，社区人员打过去的电话他们也不接。
Several phone calls were made by community workers, but Mr. and Mrs. Wang ignored them. They also blackened the telephone numbers and messages of the grid workers, who did not answer the phone calls made by community members.
没办法，李欢的同事，社区书记胡丽华亲自上马。
No way, Li Huan's colleagues, community secretary Hu Lihua personally on the horse.
2月16上午，“整整一上午的时间都在电话中劝解，我的声音就是那个时候喊哑的。
On the morning of February 16, "I spent the whole morning talking on the phone, and my voice was hoarse at that time.
”胡丽华撕扯着嗓子对1℃记者说。
"Hu Lihua tore her voice to 1 ° C reporter said.
还是没有效果，胡丽华只能找来帮手。
Still no effect, Hu Lihua can only find help.
根据当地对隔离人员采取的措施，由“四保一”人员即派出所民警、医生、社区主要负责人和片区网格员，大家亲自上门规劝。
According to the local measures taken to separate people, the "four guarantees" personnel, namely the police station police, doctors, community leaders and district grid staff, people personally exhorted.
敲门始终无人应，王氏夫妇虽在家中，但就是不愿意开门，最后只能强行进入。
No one answered the door. Mr. and Mrs. Wang were at home, but they would not open the door and had to force their way in.
“他们还是认为自己很正常，不愿意去隔离点，并且要求保证外孙不被感染新冠肺炎。
"They still think they're normal, don't want to go to the quarantine, and want to make sure they don't get infected with pneumonia.
但是社区只能配合上级部门的工作，哪里能做这些保证呢。
But the community can only cooperate with the work of higher authorities, where can these guarantees be made?
”胡丽华说。
"said Julie.
胡丽华只得往上级反应。
Hu Lihua had to react to her superiors.
最终王氏夫妇和外孙被送去隔离，“我们让他们把小孩用的奶粉、纸尿裤等日用品都带着，毕竟这个时候还是需要照顾好儿童。
Eventually, the couple and their grandson were separated. "We asked them to take care of the children with them," he said.
”为了做社区25岁居民李洋父母的隔离工作，社区人员也是花了不少心思。
"Community workers also put a lot of thought into the isolation of Li Yang's parents, a 25-year-old resident of the community.
1℃记者采访获悉，李洋是疑似新冠肺炎患者，按照当地疾控中心要求，需要隔离与他有密切接触的父母。
Reporter interviews learned that Li Yang is suspected to be the new crown pneumonia patients, according to the local CDC requirements, the need to isolate close contact with his parents.
当日下午，社区一直联系李洋的父母，“我们的工作人员在电话中反复劝阻，他们就是不愿意去隔离点，最后二人手机都关机了。
In the afternoon, Li Yang's parents were contacted by the community. "Our staff repeatedly tried to dissuade them from going to the quarantine point.
“李氏夫妇认为自己身体状况正常，并且还想料理调养刚出院的儿子。
"The Lee and his wife think they are in good health and want to take care of their recently released son.
我说现在只能到集中隔离点观察，待隔离期过了之后，才能知道你们的身体是否正常。
I said now I can only go to the central isolation point to observe, after the quarantine period, you can not know whether your body is normal.
”胡丽华说。
"said Julie.
在强行要求下，李氏夫妇最终前往隔离点。
Under duress, Mr. and Mrs. Lee eventually went to the quarantine site.
2月17日，社区工作人员告知1℃记者，李洋的母亲王女士亦确诊了新冠肺炎，目前已被收治。
On 17 February, community workers told reporters that Ms. Wang, Li Yang's mother, had also been diagnosed with pneumonia and was now in hospital.
“好在有惊无险，不然刚出院的李洋回来，王女士又传染给家人，那社区就不得安宁了。
"Fortunately, there is no danger, or just left the hospital Li Yang back, Ms. Wang infected the family, the community there is no peace.
”说起这些，李欢仍旧心有余悸。
"Speaking of which, Li Huan still had palpitations.
停不下的陀螺“忙了一天，辛苦也就算了，还被居民投诉。
Unstoppable gyro "busy all day, even if the hard work, but also by residents complained.
” 2月19日晚上8时许，刚忙完为期三天的拉网式大排查工作还未下班的李欢，给1℃记者发来了两张市长专线政务督办单截图。
Li Huan, who had just left work after a three-day sweep, sent two screenshots of the mayor's office at around 8 p.m. on Feb. 19.
那是关于居民对社区的投诉，最终反馈到社区。
It is about complaints from residents to the community, which are then fed back into the community.
“接市防疫指挥部命令，居民每三日可外出采购生活物资，今日社区完全禁止外出，这是防疫指挥部命令，还是社区私自所为？家中已无米下锅，防疫工作要开展，居民生活也要保障。
"The epidemic prevention command has ordered residents to go out every three days to purchase household goods. Today the community is completely banned from going out. Is this ordered by the epidemic prevention command or by the community itself?
”上述督办单上清晰地记载了居民在2月19日投诉的内容。
The details of the residents' complaints on February 19 are clearly set out on the inspection list.
李欢和她的同事们觉得委屈，有人私下嘀咕：一会儿要全面封闭，一会儿又不能全封，让管理无所适从。
Li Huan and her colleagues feel aggrieved, some people mutter privately: one moment to be completely closed, another time can not be completely closed, let management confused.
从年三十工作到现在，近一个月的时间里，李欢与同事们就像一只陀螺一样，在上级接连不断的指示中高速运转。
From his mid-thirties to the present, Li Huan and his colleagues have been running at a high speed, like a top, in a succession of instructions from their superiors.
2月11日凌晨，武汉疫情防控再度升级：全市住宅小区启动封闭管理，最大限度减少人员流动。
In the early morning hours of February 11, Wuhan epidemic prevention and control again escalated: the city's residential areas to initiate closed management, to minimize the movement of personnel.
每户家庭凭出入证，每三天可指派一人出门采购生活物资。
Each household will be assigned one person every three days to purchase household goods on the strength of a pass.
2月15日，武汉新任市委书记王忠林在基层走访后指出，现阶段部分小区的封闭管理还存在一些问题。
February 15, Wuhan's new party secretary Wang Zhonglin said after a grass-roots visit, the current stage of the closed management of some small areas there are still some problems.
他提出，“这个问题要好好研究，让市民不出小区也能买到东西。
"This is an issue that needs to be studied so that citizens can buy things without going out of the community," he said.
”比如弄个大包，生活物资、防护物资从网上预订，直接送到家或社区门口，这样市民就不用出来了，就能执行封闭通告。
For example, make a big bag, book your supplies and supplies online, and deliver it directly to your home or community door, so that citizens don't have to come out and enforce the closure notice.
新洲区亦实行小区村庄百分之百24小时封闭管理，进出小区需要严格登记，且该区所有超市一律停止经营，居民购买生活物资需通过社区人员团购。
Xinzhou District also implemented 100% 24-hour closed management of small villages, access to the community needs to be strictly registered, and all supermarkets in the area are closed down, residents need to buy supplies through community groups.
“小区全封闭之后，居民在城区超市提供的APP平台下单。
"After the district was completely closed, residents placed orders on the APP platform provided by the city supermarket.
今天当了一天的搬运工，给居民搬运蔬菜食物。
Today, I worked as a day porter, carrying vegetables for the residents.
”李欢说。
"said Li Huan.
可是下单的人太多，该超市提供的APP平台崩溃，关闭了下单，“居民买不到物资，又冲我们发火，还投诉。
But there were too many orders, and the APP platform provided by the supermarket collapsed, closing the order. "Residents can't buy supplies, they're angry at us and they complain.
”李欢欲哭无泪。
Li Huan wept.
李欢附近社区的书记曹雪梅与她的同事们同样忙碌又委屈。
Cao Xuemei, secretary of the neighborhood of Li Huan, is as busy and aggrieved as her colleagues.
曹雪梅所在的社区有2000户，共分为7个小区，全部住满共有超过万名居民，大部分都有物业管理公司。
Cao's 2,000-family community is divided into seven subdivisions, all of which are home to more than 10,000 residents, most of them owned by property management companies.
在这次疫情过程中，管理如此庞大的社区，在职的工作人员却仅有曹雪梅与他的10名同事，且大多数是女同志。
Cao and 10 of his colleagues, most of them lesbians, worked in a community so vast in the course of the epidemic.
自小区之前出现确诊病例后，许多居民都做好了防护，较少外出，社区主动承担了居民生活物资采购的事宜，建立了蔬菜、鸡蛋、粮油等多个物资的微信采购群。
Since the emergence of confirmed cases in the small areas, many residents have been protected, less travel, the community has taken the initiative to take over the procurement of household goods, the establishment of vegetables, eggs, grain and oil and other supplies of the micro-procurement group.
“我们让供应商统一放到小区门口，社区人员给每家每户联系，让大家依次排队下来领取。
"We asked the suppliers to be unified in front of the community, the community members to each family contact, so that everyone queued down in turn to receive.
”曹雪梅说。
'said Cao.
“前段时间外地来了10吨蔬菜，停在小区门口，需要从车上卸货下来，也是我们这批女同志再加上几名志愿者，搬运了几个小时才卸完。
"Some time ago, 10 tons of vegetables from the outside, parked in front of the plot, need to unload from the car, but also we comrades, together with a few volunteers, carried a few hours before the finished unloading.
”曹雪梅说。
'said Cao.
2月19日，武汉市委书记王忠林提到，小区封闭管理后，要组织一支强大的志愿者队伍，为需要买药、不会网购的老人提供服务；各区要开动脑筋，创新方式，确保居民生活基本必需品的供应，有解决不了的问题要及时反馈。
On February 19, Wuhan city party secretary Wang Zhonglin mentioned that after the closed management of the community, we should organize a strong volunteer team to serve elderly people who need to buy medicines and do not buy online.
目前，李欢所在的社区也已经有不少居民志愿者前来帮忙。
At present, Li Huan's community has a lot of resident volunteers to help.
“住在一个小区大家都是一家人，等熬过这段时间就好了。
"It would be nice to stay in a neighborhood where everyone is a family," he said.
”社区居民志愿者杜先生告诉1℃记者。
Mr. Du, a community resident volunteer, told reporters at 1oC.
