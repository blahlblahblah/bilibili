但我们知道，现在散布在全国各地的武汉人，甚至湖北人，都在主动或者被动的接受一些隔离安排。
But we know that Wuhan people, even Hubei people, who are now scattered all over the country, are actively or passively accepting some isolation arrangements.
那在隔离中的他们现在生活怎么样？过得好不好？身处其中的体验如何？今天，让我们来听听他们的故事。
So how are they now living in isolation? How's it going? How's their experience? Today, let's hear their story.
Punch，武汉上学回家后在河北某市指定宾馆隔离我是 Punch，在武汉上学，今天是 2020 年 2 月 1 日，是我回到家的第 12 天，也是我在河北省某市一家指定宾馆接受隔离的第 3 天。
I am Punch, studying in Wuhan, February 1st, 2020, the twelfth day of my return home, and the third day of isolation at a designated hotel in a city in Hebei Province.
从 21 日回家到现在，我的体温一直处于正常水平，也没有表现出其他的症状，但还是不被允许在家自我隔离。
By the time I got home on the 21st, my temperature had been normal and I had shown no other symptoms, but I was still not allowed to isolate myself at home.
从回家后到初五，一直都没什么事。
From home to the fifth day of junior high, nothing happened.
只是居委会在初二初三时来电问我体温。
Only the neighborhood committee called me on the third day of junior high school.
初四就没有电话了。
There's no phone on fourth day of junior high.
到了初五，早上 9 点，我妈突然接到一个电话，说要把我隔离。
On the fifth day of junior high, at 9 a. m., my mother suddenly got a call saying she was going to quarantine me.
我妈妈当时就提出说，没症状能不能选择居家隔离。
My mother suggested at the time that no symptoms can be isolated at home.
那边就说要再问上级的意思。
That way, I'm going to ask my superiors again.
下午 4 点多，另外一个居委会的工作人员来电说，可以居家隔离。
More than 4 p. m., another neighborhood committee worker called to say that the house can be isolated.
我们就松了一口气，觉得没事了。
We all heaved a sigh of relief and thought we were okay.
结果，到了晚上 9 点，又来了一通电话，是早上的那个人打的，他说现在的要求必须到宾馆隔离，而且不光是我，我妈妈因跟我接触，要一起隔离，必须晚上 12 点前到，不然警方就会介入。
As a result, at nine o'clock in the evening, another phone call arrived, from the man in the morning, who said that the request must now be isolated from the hotel, and that it was not only I, but my mother, who was in contact with me, wanted to be quarantined together, and had to be there by 12: 00, otherwise the police would intervene.
一听这么严肃，我们也是很配合，就开始收拾东西。
As soon as we heard this, we were very cooperative and began to pack.
结果 10 点的时候又打电话来说，我妈不收了，就只收我一个人，没有具体解释原因。
It turned out at 10: 00 to call again, my mother did not accept, just accept me a person, did not specifically explain why.
■被隔离的 Punch 在宾馆房间拍下 1 月 30 日至 2 月 2 日窗外所见我没有症状，心里是不情愿去的，因为它相当于把所有武汉停留史的人聚在一起，万一真有携带者的话，我觉得挺危险。
■ The isolated Punch filmed in a hotel room what I saw outside the window from January 30 to February 2. I was asymptomatic and reluctant to go, as it amounted to gathering all the people who had stopped in Wuhan, and I thought it would be dangerous if there were a carrier.
但当时，他说是市里大晚上紧急开会决定的，感觉确实是有政策。
But at the time, he said, it was the city's emergency meeting that decided, and it felt like there was a policy.
而我又确实是从武汉回来的。
And I did come back from Wuhan.
另外，如果不去，警方介入，就太没必要了。
Besides, if you don't, the police will step in, it's too unnecessary.
我其实上午就在为被隔离做思想准备，提前想了想要带什么。
I was actually thinking about being quarantined this morning, thinking about what I wanted to bring with me.
当时除了换洗的衣服，我还带了一些口罩、酒精、酒精棉、小喷壶。
In addition to changing clothes, I also brought some masks, alcohol, alcohol cotton, small spray bottle.
其实我心里是怕的。
In fact, my heart is afraid.
虽然这边再三说消毒过多次，但我还是想多带点这些。
Although this side repeatedly said disinfection many times, but I still want to bring more of these.
我家没汽车，只有一个电动车。
I don't have a car, only an electric car.
北方晚上 10 点多还挺冷的，但是这边要求得很急，来不及安排车接。
Northern night more than 10: 00 is quite cold, but this side of the request is very urgent, too late to arrange car to pick up.
我妈妈就骑着电动车带着我过去。
My mom took me by on an electric bike.
我妈妈身体不好，我们到时已经 11 点多了。
My mother is not in good health. We arrived at more than 11 o'clock.
她回家就 12 点了。
It's twelve o'clock when she gets home.
我和她视频时，她的表情不太好，我问她怎么了，她说满口牙疼。
When I saw her, she didn't look so good. I asked her what was wrong. She said she had a toothache.
我知道她当晚肯定没睡好。
I know she didn't sleep well that night.
后来聊天知道，她是凌晨 4 点多才将将睡着。
Chat later learned that she would not fall asleep until after 4am.
集中隔离地方是当地的一个我妈年轻时就有的，年头挺久的宾馆。
Centralized segregation is a local hotel that my mother had when she was young and had been around for a long time.
当晚我们到时，宾馆正门已经封住了，只能从侧面的那种很旧的室外楼梯上去。
By the time we arrived that evening, the main entrance to the hotel had been sealed off and could only be reached by the old indoor staircase on the side.
那里有个护士做登记，她问我有没有隔离通知单，我没有。
There was a nurse checking in and she asked me if I had an isolation notice. I didn't.
她说后面要补，但是我现在还没看到。
She said she would mend it later, but I haven't seen it yet.
宾馆挺多层的，我在 6 层。
The hotel is multi-storey. I'm on the 6th floor.
之前在楼下有听到送东西的人喊说，自己孩子在 8 层。
Someone downstairs had heard the messenger say his child was on the 8th floor.
到了 6 楼，是一道比较旧的门，上面拴着铁链锁。
On the sixth floor was an old door, fastened to an iron chain.
当时挺黑的，我没看清。
It was dark. I didn't see it.
我的房间正好挨着门。
My room is next to the door.
房间是三人间，因为有三张床。
The room is three, because there are three beds.
但只有我一个人住。
But I live alone.
进来的第一感觉是冷，因为北方没暖气还是很冷的。
The first feeling of coming in is cold, because there is no heating in the north or very cold.
它只有一个中央空调。
It has only one central air conditioner.
但非典时，中央空调是不让用的，这次也有新闻说隔离酒店应关闭中央空调，所以我第一晚特别害怕，都没敢开空调。
But SARS, central air conditioning is not allowed, this time there are news that the isolation hotel should close the central air conditioning, so I was particularly scared the first night, dare not open the air-conditioning.
但是到了凌晨 3 点，即便穿着所有的衣服、羽绒服，盖了两床被子，我还是冷得受不了，牙齿打颤。
But by 3 a. m. even with all my clothes and down and two quilts on, I was too cold to stand and my teeth trembled.
■空调开关和出风口我特别纠结，到底要不要开空调？我很害怕，可深更半夜，朋友睡了，我又不敢跟我妈说，怕她担心。
Are you going to turn on the air conditioner or not? I'm afraid, but in the middle of the night, my friend sleeps, and I don't dare to tell my mother that she is worried.
我就打开手机录音机，自己和自己说话壮胆。
I turned on my cellphone recorder and spoke to myself.
后面我想，如果这样活活被冻发烧，体温出了问题，就太不值了，所以我还是开了空调。
In the back, I thought that if I got a fever and had a temperature problem, it would not be worth it, so I turned on the air conditioner.
开空调的一瞬间，我眼前真的好像出现了病毒一下涌出来，在空气里纷飞的样子。
Turn on the air conditioner for an instant, I really seem to have a virus out of the eyes, in the air flying appearance.
那晚我是戴着口罩睡的，大概从凌晨 4 点睡到早上 8 点。
I was wearing a mask that night and I slept from about 4 a.m. to 8 a.m.
正式隔离的第一天，我是 8 点被电话叫醒的，因为我们测体温是通过电话询问的方式，我迷迷糊糊地接电话，测体温，告诉她体温正常。
On the first day of formal isolation, I was woken up at 8: 00, because our temperature was taken by telephone, and I answered the phone in a daze, took my temperature and told her my temperature was normal.
那天上午，我决定反映一下。
That morning, I decided to reflect.
负责人说空调没问题，这里的隔离条件是专家审核过的。
The person in charge said that the air conditioning is not a problem, here the isolation conditions are reviewed by experts.
不过我还是有点不放心，因为我打电话给前台，他一会说是分层控制，一会说是每屋独立控制，摇摆的答案让人不安。
But I was a little uneasy, because I called the front desk and he said it was tiered and controlled, and the swing answer was unsettling.
我对这个问题始终比较怀疑，所以即便在屋里，只要开空调，我还是会戴着口罩。
I've always been skeptical about this, so even if I were inside, I'd wear a mask just to turn on the air conditioner.
第一天，基本上就是在不停地打电话，上网查资料中度过的。
The first day, basically is in ceaseless call, on the net check material spent.
这里一日三餐都是按时放在门口的。
All meals are served at the door on time.
早餐一般是粥或一些干粮，午餐是从饭店订的盒饭。
Breakfast is usually porridge or some dry food, lunch from the hotel ordered box of rice.
送饭人会敲门，然后喊房间号，我觉得是为了确认里面的人是清醒状态。
The giver knocks at the door and then calls the room number, which I think is to make sure the person inside is awake.
我不敢开门，更不敢出门。
I dare not open the door, still less go out.
虽然他们每天都消毒，但我还是不敢，甚至说开过门后，我要在门廊喷一遍酒精才能安心。
Although they disinfect them every day, I dare not even say that after I open the door, I have to spray alcohol on the porch to be at ease.
所以平时收饭，也没见过其他人。
So I don't even see anyone else.
直到昨天我才第一次看到送饭的人。
It was not until yesterday that I first saw the giver.
我同学调侃说，怎么感觉跟坐牢似的？但等我心态平稳后，倒觉得还好。
My classmate mocks say, how to feel with go to jail like? But when my mood is steady, feel good however.
白天的时候，我妈给我送了电热毯。
During the day, my mother gave me an electric blanket.
从那以后，我睡觉就不开空调了，也不用再戴口罩。
Since then, I have been sleeping without the air conditioner and without wearing a mask.
所以第二晚睡得还挺好。
So I slept well the second night.
昨天，整个人的心态就更缓和一些，没那么怕了。
Yesterday, the mentality of the whole more moderate, less afraid.
而且我妈也跟我聊，就说「你已经住到这儿了，又不能走，你只能选择相信，因为不信任也没有办法，不要自己再吓自己，反倒那样会让你整个人很紧张。
And my mother talked to me and said, "You live here, you can't go, you have to believe, because there is no way to distrust, not to frighten yourself, but to make you nervous.
万一连带的身体也有一些反应，就不好了。
If there's some reaction from the body, it's not good.
」第二天，也就是跟同学聊聊天，看看电子书什么。
"The next day, we talked to each other and read an e-book.
在小空间里待久了，腿有点麻，关节也都很僵硬，所以昨天我做了拉伸，也是给自己找点事做。
I stayed in the small space for a long time, my legs were a bit numb and my joints were stiff, so yesterday I stretched and found something for myself to do.
中午就正常的吃饭。
I'll eat normally at noon.
■房间内部的样子下午我妈妈又给我送了一些水果。
In the afternoon my mother gave me some more fruit.
一开始我妈特别担心，寝食难安。
At first my mother was very worried about bedding.
但就像她说的，既来之则安之。
But as she said, take things as they come.
我感觉她这两天状态比以前好一点。
I feel like she's in better shape these two days.
但还是总想给我送东西，就总问我「你吃要不要吃这个？」「你吃要不要吃那个？」其实在小房间里面运动量很小，每天吃不下多少，但我能感受到她很怕我想用什么没有，想吃什么没有。
But I always wanted to send something to me, always asking me, "Do you want this?" "Do you want that?" In fact, the small amount of exercise in the small room, not enough to eat every day, but I can feel that she is afraid of what I want to eat or not.
怕我受委屈。
Afraid of my wrongs.
其他的主要还是打发时间。
The rest of the time was still spent.
每天早上测完体温，我都会给房间通通风，再烧一大壶热水，开始一大波消毒。
Every morning, after taking my temperature, I ventilate the room, boil a big pot of hot water and start a big wave of disinfection.
觉得时间还过得还挺快。
Thought time was still running out.
而且几个关系好的同学也给我很大帮助，他们拉了个群，陪我聊聊天，玩玩剧本杀之类的打发时间的游戏。
And several good students also give me a lot of help, they pull a group, accompany me to chat, play script kill and so on pass the time game.
他们说你自己一个人也害怕，有什么事就跟他们聊。
They say you're scared of yourself, so just talk to them about something.
我觉得给我帮助挺大的。
I think it's a great help to me.
家里也是，吃饭时，我们都是视频着一起吃。
The same is true at home, when eating, we are all video eat together.
按照居委会和负责人的说法，因为有 14 天潜伏期，我从到家开始算要观察 14 天。
As there was a 14-day incubation period, I watched for 14 days from the time I got home, according to the neighborhood committee and the chief executive.
现在已经是我到家的第 12 天了。
It's the twelfth day since I got home.
再隔离 2 天，没有异常，我应该就可以回家了吧。
Two more days of isolation, no abnormality, I should be able to go home.
现在看整件事，我从收到消息时震惊不安，到现在其实心态比较平稳。
Now look at the whole thing, I received the news from the shock of uneasiness, and now the state of mind is relatively calm.
一开始，觉得条件不够完善，手续也不完备，比如说，通知都只是电话方式，我没有看到任何书面材料。
At first, I felt that the conditions were not perfect and the formality was incomplete. For example, the notice was just a phone call.
后面，我想他们要在全市去集结这些人其实是挺大的工作量，也就算了。
Later, I thought it would be a lot of work for them to gather people all over the city.
但我最大的担心还是对无症状人员的隔离，真的有必要都集结在宾馆吗？我个人比较害怕。
But my biggest worry is the isolation of asymptomatic people. Is it really necessary to gather in a hotel? I am personally afraid.
我觉得这样可能会增大感染几率。
I think this could increase the risk of infection.
现在就觉得还是选择相信，因为你总是去反映的话，也在增加他们现在已经够大的工作量。
Feel free to believe now, because if you're always there, it's adding to the amount of work they already have.
可能现在是勉强能支撑，你再去反映，他们没有具体回应，却可能忙多出错。
It may be that they are barely able to support it now, and then you reflect that they are not responding in concrete terms, but may be busy making more mistakes.
Jason，科研工作者目前滞留在云南昆明，自我隔离我们一家三口每年春节都会出门旅游，今年也不例外。
Jason, a research worker who lives in Kunming, Yunnan, isolates three of our family for the annual Spring Festival, and this year is no exception.
去年 12 月，我们就预定好了行程，准备 1 月 20 日出发，跟团去云南旅游。
Last December, we made a reservation for a trip to Yunnan on January 20th.
大约在元旦的时候，我和很多人一样，在网上看到了关于某种肺炎的传言。
Around New Year's Day, like many people, I read about some kind of pneumonia on the Internet.
由于所处行业的关系，我对这个传言留意得相对多一些。
Because of the industry I work in, I pay relatively more attention to this rumor.
那段时间，不是有 8 个发布消息的人被约谈了吗？其中有个医生和我的一个朋友在同一家医院工作。
Didn't eight people who published the news get interviewed during that time? One of the doctors worked in the same hospital as one of my friends.
当时，那些医生朋友尽管不敢在网上说，但还是会尽力通过朋友圈隐晦地提示一些信息，比如大家一定要戴口罩，当下的形势是不轻松的。
At the time, even though they didn't dare to talk online, the doctors and friends tried to hints at things through their circle of friends, such as the fact that everyone had to wear masks.
看到这些消息后，我第一时间采购了一些口罩，并且和家人一起严格佩戴，不敢松懈。
After reading this news, I bought some masks the first time, and with the family wearing strict, dare not relax.
但与此同时，我对他所说的「并不轻松」没有完全明白。
At the same time, however, what he said was "not easy" was not entirely clear to me.
毕竟，我的专业方向并不是医学，也拿不到第一手数据。
After all, my specialty is not medicine, and I don't get first-hand data.
按照我当时的理解，这场疫情目前仅仅是一场火灾里的一团小火，只要「上面」足够重视，就能够把它扑灭。
As I understood it at the time, the outbreak was just a small fire in a fire that could be extinguished if enough attention was paid to it.
正是基于这个乐观的判断，再加上当时官方认定的「可防可控」，我没有取消家人的旅行计划。
It was on the basis of this optimistic assessment, coupled with what was then officially considered "defensible," that I did not cancel my family's travel plans.
1 月 20 日，我们从武汉出发，前往昆明。
On January 20, we set out for Kunming from Wuhan.
旅途的全程中，直到最终抵达酒店，我和家人都戴了口罩，一刻也没有摘下来过。
My family and I wore masks throughout the journey until we finally arrived at the hotel and never took them off for a moment.
接下来的这几天，游玩途中，各方消息纷至沓来，形势变化远远超出了我的想象。
Over the next few days, news poured in from all sides during the trip, and the situation changed beyond my wildest dreams.
我隐隐预感到，我们可能回不了家了。
I had a vague foreboding that we might not be able to go home.
■夜游西双版纳植物园果然，1 月 23 日凌晨，在西双版纳，我起床上厕所的时候，收到了「武汉封城」的消息。
Xishuangbanna Botanical Garden Sure enough, January 23, in the early morning, Xishuangbanna, when I got up to go to the toilet, I received the news of the "Wuhan Sealing City.
尽管我已经有了心理准备，但那一刻，还是万分震惊。
Even though I was mentally prepared, I was shocked at the moment.
那么，接下来该怎么办？孩子要怎么上学？我们要怎么工作？这个国家又将要面对什么？从那一天起，所有人才真正意识到了问题的严重性。
So what happens next? How do children go to school? How do we work? What does the country have to face? From that day on, all people really realize the seriousness of the problem.
而与此同时，我们在异乡的处境也变得微妙起来。
At the same time, our situation in a foreign country has become delicate.
就在 23 日那天上午，我们登上旅行团的大巴后，发生了第一个信号。
On the morning of the 23rd we boarded the tour bus, and the first signal came.
导游在例行讲解了当天的行程和注意事项后，突然插播了一个消息：我们家和另外一个家庭的航班被取消了。
After giving a routine account of the day's itinerary and precautions, the guide interrupted a message that our home and another family's flight had been canceled.
然后，她问我们是从哪里出发的。
Then she asked us where we had started.
我便如实回答说，「我们是从武汉出发的」。
I answered truthfully, "We started from Wuhan."
就在那一刻，我清楚地听到后排传来了一阵倒吸冷气的声音。
At that moment, I clearly heard a gasp of air-conditioning coming from the back row.
我能想象，同车的旅伴们此刻肯定十分懊恼，觉得自己怎么这么倒霉，碰上了一群武汉人。
I can imagine that my fellow travellers must be very annoyed at the moment, and I feel so unlucky that they met a group of Wuhan people.
到达景点后，我下车时发现，旅行团中戴口罩的人明显增多了。
When I got off the bus, I noticed a marked increase in the number of people wearing masks in the tour.
在此之前，除了我们一家人以外，只有少数人戴了口罩。
Before that, only a few people other than my family wore masks.
对了，这里有必要说明一下，旅行团中另外一家被取消了航班的人并不是从武汉出发的。
By the way, it is necessary to make it clear that the other canceller on the package tour did not depart from Wuhan.
他们是从江苏出发的，而之所以会被「锁定」，仅仅因为他们的籍贯在武汉。
They started from Jiangsu and were "locked up" simply because they came from Wuhan.
接下来，1 月 24 日，我们从西双版纳返回了昆明，而在当时，酒店还是允许我们入住的。
Then, on January 24th, we returned to Kunming from Xishuangbanna, where we were still allowed to stay.
1 月 25 日，形势越来越糟。
On 25 January, the situation deteriorated.
从这天开始，酒店每隔一段时间都会给我们全家人测体温，还给我们的身份证件拍了照，说是当地派出所需要。
From that day on, the hotel took a temperature check for the whole family at regular intervals and took photos of our ID cards, saying they were needed at the local police station.
酒店的服务人员也对我们的房间避之不及。
The hotel staff also took refuge in our room.
1 月 26 日，我上午 7:30 分去了酒店的餐厅吃自助早餐，一切如常。
On January 26, I went to the hotel restaurant for a buffet breakfast at 7: 30 a.m., and everything went as usual.
大约 9:00，我的妻子和儿子才起床去吃早餐，但是，他们很快就回来了。
At about 9: 00, my wife and son just got up for breakfast, but they were soon back.
原来，他们刚到餐厅门口，报上了房间号，就被如临大敌地拦住了。
It turned out that they had just arrived at the restaurant door, newspaper room number, was as if the enemy stopped them.
服务人员提出，他们会把早餐送到我们的房间来，让我们自行用餐。
The attendants suggested that they would bring breakfast to our room and let us have our own meal.
当时，我的儿子感到非常委屈，对他来说，这样的事情确实很难理解。
At the time, my son felt so wronged that it was really hard for him to understand.
我只好哄他说，「酒店的送餐服务都是要加收服务费的，他们免费给我们送餐，这可是提高了我们的服务待遇啊！」但儿子还是不开心，我就从洗手间里拿出了两筒卷纸，逗他说，「没事，他们既然不让我们去餐厅，我们就把他们的卷纸统统拿走！」他这才破涕为笑。
I had to coax him into saying, "The food service at the hotel is a service charge, and they give us free meals, which enhances our service!" But my son was unhappy and I pulled out two rolls of paper from the bathroom and teased him, "Well, since they won't let us go to the restaurant, we'll take away all their rolls."
当然，我这么做也不仅仅是为了逗儿子开心。
Of course, I didn't do it just to amuse my son.
我能预见到，如果事态发展下去，物资供应必然会紧张，这两筒卷纸也许会派上用场。
I foresaw that if things went on, supplies would be tight and the rolls of paper might come in handy.
我儿子的委屈也并不是没来由的。
My son's grievance is not without cause.
就在那天，我们在大巴上承认自己是从武汉来的以后，他刚认识的一个小伙伴差点就不和他玩了。
That very day, we admitted on the bus that he was from Wuhan, he just met a small partner almost did not play with him.
但好在，小孩子之间都是比较好沟通的。
But the good news is that kids are better communicators.
当时，我儿子振振有词地向小伙伴解释，「我没有冠状病毒呀！不是每个武汉人都有冠状病毒的！」那孩子很快就被说服了，说，「好吧，那我相信你！」然后，两个孩子便又戴着口罩愉快地玩到一起了。
At the time, my son excitedly explained to his partner, "I have no coronavirus! Not every Wuhan person has a coronavirus!" The child was soon convinced and said, "Well, then I believe you!"
后来有一天，那个孩子又来找我们了。
Then one day, the boy came to see us again.
他对我说，「我妈妈说想问你一下，你们现在有没有发热现象啊？我妈妈说他们单位要问这个」。
He said to me, "My mom said she wanted to ask you, do you have any fever now? My mother said they had to ask this."
我注意到，当时，他的妈妈脸上露出了很不好意思的表情。
I noticed a sheepish expression on his mother's face at the time.
显然，她心里有忧虑，又不好意思问出口，就让孩子来试探一下。
Evidently, her heart was troubled, and she was too shy to ask for an outlet. Let the child try.
于是，我告诉那个孩子，「不用担心，我们全家都量过体温了，我们没有任何问题，也请你妈妈放心」。
So I told the child, "Don't worry, my family has taken the temperature. We have no problem, please rest assured."
那天，旅行团在昆明原本还剩下一个本地的旅行项目，但是，他们还是让我们两个武汉籍家庭签署了「自愿退团」的协议。
On that day, the tour group in Kunming originally had a local travel program, but they still let us two Wuhan families signed the "voluntary withdrawal" agreement.
在酒店退房的前一天，我们已经预定好了昆明当地的一家民宿。
The day before the hotel check-out, we had booked a local lodging in Kunming.
由于那家民宿的老板也是湖北人，出于对老乡的照顾，他们在了解清楚了我们全家的情况，以及从一月初以来的严格防护经历后，同意我们入住。
As the owner of the house was also a native of Hubei, they agreed to stay after learning about our family and the strict protection they had had since the beginning of January.
但接下来，我们就收到了消息，按照云南旅游管理上级单位的要求，所有民宿都不能随意接待武汉游客。
But then, we received the news, according to the request of the higher level Yunnan tourism management units, all residential accommodation can not arbitrarily receive Wuhan tourists.
我们不愿意给民宿老板添麻烦，便取消了预定。
Unwilling to cause trouble to the landlords, we cancelled the reservation.
在当时，我了解到，云南省对于我们这些湖北籍游客提供的解决方案是：他们要求各个市／自治州指定一到两家酒店，为湖北游客提供住宿。
At the time, I learned that the solution Yunnan offered to us Hubei tourists was that they required each city / autonomous prefecture to designate one or two hotels to accommodate Hubei tourists.
说实话，对于这项举措，我是很不接受。
To be honest, I do not accept this initiative.
撇开心理上「受歧视」的因素，我能预想到，当我们这么多外籍游客被隔离到一两家酒店后，一旦物资供应出了问题，一定会有麻烦，同时，交叉感染的风险也会增大。
Apart from the psychological factor of "discrimination," I can imagine that when so many of our foreign tourists are quarantined in one or two hotels, there will be trouble once the supplies get out of hand and the risk of cross-infection will increase.
幸好，在这个时候，我联系到了一个当地的老朋友，带着家人搬进了他的一个空置的新房里，一直住到现在。
Luckily, at this point, I contacted a local old friend and took my family into an empty new room where I live until now.
这些天以来，除了我出门采购了两次物资以外，我们一家人几乎都没怎么出门，连倒垃圾都只能趁着夜黑风高的时候出门，生怕被邻居撞见，让他们听说楼里住了武汉人，搞得人心惶惶。
These days, except for two shopping trips, my family almost never go out, even the garbage can only take advantage of the dark night wind to go out, afraid to be caught by neighbors, let them hear that Wuhan people live in the building, caused panic.
我的一个在上海自我隔离的朋友比我们更惨，他连垃圾都不敢随便扔，因为当地已经实施了垃圾分类，他不熟练，一旦搞错了，就会被邻居发现他是外地人，引来麻烦。
One of my friends in Shanghai who isolates himself is even more miserable than we are. He doesn't even dare to throw his rubbish away because the local garbage collection has been implemented and he is not proficient.
我还记得，有一次，我出门采购物资的时候打了一辆出租车，司机师傅攀谈的时候，问我是哪里人。
I remember, once, when I was out shopping, I took a taxi. When the driver talked to me, he asked me where I was from.
我为了避免麻烦，就说自己是河南人，可司机师傅还是大惊失色，「你们河南都传染那么多了，还跑出来哇！」尽管郁闷，但好在，从 1 月 20 日算起，我们一家人离开武汉已经 12 天了，马上就要超过所谓的「潜伏期」天数了。
To avoid trouble, I said I was from Henan Province, but the driver was shocked. "You all got so much infection in Henan and ran out!" Although depressed, the family has been away from Wuhan for 12 days since Jan. 20 and is about to exceed the so-called incubation period.
在那之后，也许就不会这么麻烦了。
After that, maybe it won't be so much trouble.
姜姜，武汉人在珠海隔离的第 10 天今天是 2 月 1 日，我们是 1 月 22 日从武汉到的珠海。
Jiang Jiang, Wuhan people in the Zhuhai Isolation of the 10th day today is February 1, we are January 22 from Wuhan to Zhuhai.
为了这个春节假期，我和朋友 10 月底就定好了行程，原本计划的是 1 月 22 日到了珠海后，1 月 24 日从珠海到澳门，然后再坐飞机到马尼拉，开始我们的春节之旅。
For the Spring Festival holiday, my friends and I made plans for a trip to Zhuhai at the end of October. We had planned to arrive at Zhuhai on January 22, then from Zhuhai to Macao on January 24th.
但是 1 月 21 日的时候，我看新闻上说因为这边的疫情，已经不鼓励大家来武汉了，心里面咯噔了一下，我意识到事情可能有点严重。
But on January 21, I looked at the news saying that because of the outbreak here, people are not encouraged to come to Wuhan, I thought, I realized that things may be a bit serious.
于是我马上拨通了市长热线，想跟他们确认一下，在这种情况下我还能不能出去旅游，当时工作人员给我的回复是，他们没有资格限制我们的人身自由。
So I dialed the mayor's hotline to confirm with them if I could go on a trip under these circumstances, and I was told by the staff that they were not entitled to restrict our personal liberty.
因为我们一直收到的消息都是「病情是可控的」，考虑到疫情应该还在可控范围之内，所以等到第二天我们就按照原计划出发了，从武汉到广州南，然后再从广州南到了珠海。
As we had been told that the disease was "manageable," we waited until the next day to proceed as planned, from Wuhan to southern Guangzhou and then from Guangzhou to Zhuhai.
到了珠海的第二天，也就是 1 月 23 日，我早上起来刷了一下微博，然后就傻了——武汉封城了！我马上就意识到事情很严重了，就跟我的同伴商量了一下，我们都很怕出去会给别人带来困扰，于是就决定退掉后面的行程。
On January 23, the second day of Zhuhai, I got up in the morning, brushed my tweet, and then I was foolish - Wuhan Sealed! I immediately realized how serious the matter was, discussed it with my companions, and we were afraid that going out would cause problems for others, so I decided to back off.
退掉行程之后，我预订了 24 号回程的火车票，因为那个时候已经不能直接买到武汉站的车票了，在电话里跟铁路的工作人员沟通情况了之后，我们买了武汉的下一站信阳的火车票。
After canceling the trip, I booked the return train ticket of No.24, because the train ticket of Wuhan station was not available directly at that time. After communicating with the railway staff on the phone, we bought the next station, Xinyang train ticket.
因为原本只是为了方便过关去澳门，我们住的酒店比较简陋，住了一天之后，考虑马上就要过年了，我们就换了一家好一点的酒店。
Because originally only in order to go to Macao, we live in a relatively humble hotel, after a day, consider the New Year soon, we changed to a better hotel.
■酒店前台的提示等我们到了新预定的这个酒店的时候，前台的小妹妹看到我们身份证上的武汉二字，就停住了，告诉我们，「系统坏了，需要稍等一下」。
When we arrived at our newly booked hotel, the little sister at the front desk stopped at the word Wuhan on our ID card and told us, "The system is broken, we need to wait a minute."
不一会儿，他们的经理就过来了，说他们也没有别的意思，就希望我们去医院做一个体检，拿着健康证明来办理入住。
After a while, their manager came over and said that they had no other meaning, so they wanted us to go to the hospital for a medical check-up and check in with a health certificate.
我们当时也很理解，毕竟出了这么大的事，我们又是从武汉来的，酒店谨慎一些也是正常的，于是我们就打车去了医院。
We also understood that after all, after all such a big thing, we came from Wuhan, hotel cautious is also normal, so we took a taxi to the hospital.
说明来意后，在导医台的工作人员的指引下，我们挂了内科的号。
After explaining the meaning, under the guidance of the medical staff, we hung up the internal medicine number.
等进了诊室，医生就问我们，「哪里不舒服？」我们说，「我们没有不舒服。
When we entered the room, the doctor asked us, "What's wrong?" We said, "We're not sick."
因为我们是从武汉来的，现在要住酒店，他们希望我们开一个健康证明。
Since we are from Wuhan and we are staying in a hotel now, they want us to issue a health certificate.
」听完这句话，医生突然就炸了，说，「谁让你们上来的？谁让你们到我们这来的？我这里开不了证明！我就算证明了你现在是正常的，我也没有办法证明你以后是正常的。
"After hearing this, the doctor suddenly blew up and said," Who sent you up here? Who brought you here? I can't prove it! I can prove you are normal now, and I can't prove that you're normal again.
你这个证明要我怎么开？谁让你们来的，你就去找谁！」面对这么一串数落，我们一下就懵了。
You prove how I want to drive? Who let you come, you go to look for who! "Faced with such a series of falls, we Meng.
在心里又劝自己，可能就是这样子，你没有办法去批判别人，因为别人没有做错。
In the heart to persuade themselves that this may be the case, you have no way to criticize others, because others have not done wrong.
于是我们又去一楼导医台的小姐姐，她打了将近 20 多分钟的电话请示上级，然后让我们去挂了一个急诊的号。
So we went to the first floor of the small sister, she called for nearly 20 minutes to consult their superiors, and then let us hang up an emergency number.
到了急诊室，我发现这边的医生护士都是全副武装的。
When I got to the emergency room, I found the doctors and nurses here were well armed.
一位男护士接待了我们，等我们说明来意之后，他安慰我们说，「你别紧张。
A male nurse received us, and when we explained our intentions, he comforted us by saying, "Don't be nervous.
」但是，其实我们看得出来，他比我们更紧张。
"But we could see that he was more nervous than we were.
我们被分配给了一位急诊大夫，我们向他解释说我们现在没有发烧，也没有咳嗽，但是希望能做个检查，拿到一份健康证明来入住酒店。
We were assigned to an emergency doctor, and we explained that we had no fever and no cough, but wanted to have a check-up and a health certificate to stay at the hotel.
他说，「正常人来什么医院？你是正常人，我怎么给你开证明？正常人不需要来医院。
He said, "What hospital do normal people come to? You are normal, how can I give you a certificate? Normal people don't need to come to the hospital."
」同学问，「那能不能给我们查个血常规之类的？」医生回答说，「既然你们要求查血常规，我就给你们开个单子。
"The student asked," Can we have a blood test or something? "The doctor replied," Since you ask for a blood test, I'll give you a list.
」做完检查之后，我们所有的指标都是正常的，就拍给了酒店的前台小姐姐看，她回复我们说可以入住了。
"After the inspection, all of our indicators were normal and were shown to the hotel's front desk sister, who replied that we were ready to move in.
■街道发给姜姜的健康告知书成功入住的当晚，我们发现我们预定的那趟列车的线路图上，武汉站被取消了，客服电话也始终打不通，不明情况的我们只好选择先退票。
On the night of our successful check-in, we found that the Wuhan Railway Station had been canceled and the customer service call had been blocked. In case of doubt, we had to refund the ticket first.
因为短时间内不能离开珠海了，我们第二天就戴着口罩去了警察局，想做一下流动人口备案。
Since we couldn't leave Zhuhai for a short time, we went to the police station wearing masks the next day to make a record of the floating population.
在警察局里，警察听说我们来自武汉，跟我们说了一句「稍等」，转身就走了，不一会儿他周围的同事也都走了。
At the police station, the police heard that we were from Wuhan, said a "wait a minute," turned around and left, and soon all his colleagues left.
他们在里面的屋子里说，「快！快！外面两个武汉来的！」十几秒之后再出现，我就发现他们所有人都戴上了口罩。
They said in the inner room, "Quick! Hurry! Two Wuhan people out there!" After a dozen seconds, I found them all wearing masks.
他说，「你们那个区不归我们管。
He said, "Your district is out of our hands.
」我说，「那我们应该去哪儿呢？」他又改口说，「那算了，反正你来都来了，我还是给你登记一下。
"I said," Where should we go then? "he added." Well, anyway, you're here. I'll put you in.
」就在这个时候，酒店前台的小妹妹给我们发微信说，「不好意思，我们这边没有办法让你们继续住了。
"Just then, our little sister at the front desk tipped us off, saying," I'm sorry, there's no way we can get you to stay.
因为街道那边下来通知，不允许武汉人入住。
Because the street side down notice, do not allow Wuhan people to move in.
」这两天来遭到的各种冷漠的态度和对待，在我看到这条微信的那一刻集体爆发，我真的一下就炸了——「还要我们怎么样呢？现在酒店也不让我们入住了。
"After all the indifference and treatment I'd encountered over the past two days, the moment I saw this message broke out en masse, I literally blew up -" What about us? Now we're not allowed in either.
」对面的警察脱口而出，「这个不归我们管，这个不是我们的范围之内，这个是你们和酒店的事情，你们自己跟酒店协商。
"The policeman across the street blurted out," This is not our business. This is between you and the hotel. You talk to the hotel yourself.
」走投无路的我拨打了珠海的市长热线，说明了情况。
desperate I dialed the mayor's hotline in Zhuhai to explain the situation.
我不知道我们做错了什么？22 日出来之前，我打了武汉的市长热线确认；23 日武汉封城，我第一时间退掉了后续行程，并试图买票回家；酒店让我们开健康证明，我们立马去医院做检查；得知暂时回不去武汉了，主动到警察局做登记。
Wuhan, 23, I cancelled the first follow-up trip and tried to buy a ticket home; the hotel let us open a health certificate, we immediately went to the hospital for an examination; learned that the temporary return to Wuhan, the initiative to do the police registration.
我们一直在说服自己忍受别人的态度，告诉自己别人做的是对的，确实是我们给他们添麻烦了，我也很害怕万一自己真的有点什么事会害到别人。
We've been trying to persuade ourselves to put up with the attitude of others, to tell ourselves that others are doing the right thing, that we are really causing them trouble, and that I am afraid that if something should happen to us, it will harm them.
市长热线的接线员说，让我们稍等一下，他们会尽快处理这个问题。
The mayor's hotline operator said, 'Let's wait a minute. They'll deal with this as soon as possible.'
于是我们回到了酒店，听从前台的意见，把自己关在屋里。
So we went back to the hotel, listened to the receptionist and shut ourselves in.
等到下午，街道的主任给我们打电话了，说，「早上非常不好意思，可能大家传达之间有一些问题，是沟通不当造成了一些误解。
In the afternoon, the director of the street called us and said, "I'm sorry this morning, but maybe there was something wrong with the message.
这样好不好？你们就自己在酒店里隔离 14 天，在这期间你们可以点外卖，会有工作人员给你们送到门口。
How about this? You'll be quarantined at the hotel for 14 days, during which time you can order take-out and have someone take you to the door.
」我们按照他说的去做了。
"We did what he said.
第二天早上，我们门口来了很多人，街道的主任和他的同事们特地过来看我们，还拎了一袋巧克力和两个红包。
The next morning, there were a lot of people at our door. The street director and his colleagues came to see us, carrying a bag of chocolates and two red packets.
我们当时拒绝了，因为我们觉得已经非常给别人添麻烦了。
We turned it down because we thought we were getting into a lot of trouble.
他坚持希望我们收下，说，「这是作为政府的一点关怀。
He insisted that we take it, saying, "It's a bit of a concern for the government.
」我看到他旁边的工作人员拿起了照相机，我就问他，「什么意思？」他说，「没有别的意思，就只是拍一下，记录一下。
"I saw the man next to him pick up the camera, and I asked him," What do you mean? "He said.
」其实我们都懂。
"We all know it.
但是那个时候，我真的不希望这么狼狈的自己出现在别人的镜头里。
But at that time, I really do not want to be in such an awkward appearance in the lens of others.
在我表明不希望被拍照之后，那个工作人员就把相机收起来了。
After I made it clear that I didn't want to be photographed, the clerk put the camera away.
■隔离期间带给姜姜一些安慰的「佩琪」小碗其实我们住在酒店的这几天，真的很感谢酒店的经理，他来给我们送快递的时候，总是心疼我们，说「正常人都这样被关坏了。
We really appreciate the manager of the hotel. He always loves us when he delivers express to us. "Normal people are shut down like this."
」这几天我一直在网上刷消息，说实话我们受到的待遇确实比很多其他在外的武汉同胞要好得多，除了前期有一点小误会，酒店和街道的工作人员真的给了我们许多关怀。
To tell the truth, we were treated much better than many other Wuhan compatriots who lived outside. Except for a slight misunderstanding, the hotel and street workers really gave us a lot of concern.
我们也非常抱歉，给他们带来了很大的麻烦。
And we're very sorry that it caused them a lot of trouble.
目前，我们每天都有量体温和上报，很庆幸，截止到目前我们都很健康。
At present, we take temperature and report every day. Fortunately, we are healthy so far.
所以，我现在比较乐观地打算，在隔离期结束之后，买 2 月 7 日早上的票回武汉。
Therefore, I am now optimistic that after the end of the quarantine period, buy the February 7 morning tickets back to Wuhan.
我会提前把行李打包快递回去，然后如果列车可以停靠武汉站的话，我就从武汉站骑摩拜回家。
I'll pack my bags and express them back in advance, and if the train stops at Wuhan, I'll ride home from Wuhan.
——————其实从声音当中你应该也能听出来，在这样的非常时期，面对隔离这样的非常措施，三位讲述人表现出来的都是非常理解和配合的态度。
In the face of the extraordinary measures of isolation, the three narrators have shown a very understanding and cooperative attitude.
我们应该感谢他们为全国人做出的个人自由上的牺牲，我也希望大众不要带着偏见去对待他们，毕竟我们防的是疫情，而不是来自某个特定区域的人。
We owe it to them to sacrifice their personal freedom for the nation, and I hope that the public will not treat them with prejudice, because we are fighting an epidemic, not people from a particular region.
而且人家都牺牲这么多了，各地的部门在执行隔离措施的时候，更是要带着尊重，更细心地安排他们的生活所需。
Besides, so many sacrifices have been made, and the authorities everywhere must arrange their lives more carefully and with respect as they implement the quarantine measures.
