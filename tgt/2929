本报记者 张家振 临沂报道 “5000元认购，无理由退房，含装修均价15500元/平方米。
Our reporter Zhangjiazhenlinyi reports "5000 yuan subscription, no reason to check out, including decoration average price of 15500 yuan / m2.
”这是武汉中南熙悦项目近期给出的1、2号楼最新线上售房优惠政策。
This is Wuhan ZhongNan Hyatt project recently given 1, 2 building on the latest online sales preferential policies.
该项目此前推出的5、6号楼同户型的房源在1月5日对外的带装修销售均价还是18500元/平方米，相当于直降3000元/平方米。
On January 5, the average price of the same type of house with decoration was 18,500 yuan per square meter, which is equivalent to a direct decrease of 3,000 yuan per square meter.
中南熙悦由武汉锦悦房地产开发有限公司开发建设，也是中南集团旗下中南置地武汉区域公司进入武汉市场布局的第一个项目。
ZhongNan Heyue is developed and constructed by Wuhan Jinyue Real Estate Development Co. Ltd. It is also the first project of Zhongnan Group's regional company in Wuhan.
和中南熙悦一样，武汉众多房企及项目正被按下“暂停键”，在没有春天的楼市中通过线上售房、置业顾问直播、无理由退房等方式，寻找、收割潜在的意向购房者。
Like the ZhongNan Hyatt, Wuhan many housing enterprises and projects are being pressed "pause key", in the absence of a spring housing market through online sales, real estate consultants live, no reason to check out, and other means, to find and harvest potential home buyers.
和新房相比，武汉市二手房市场受小区封闭、中介门店关闭等因素影响，正处于“冰封”状态。
Compared with the new house, the second-hand housing market in Wuhan City is affected by factors such as the closure of residential areas and the closure of intermediary stores.
在按下“暂停键”之前，2019年的武汉楼市曾交出优异的“答卷”。
Before pressing the "pause button," Wuhan real estate market in 2019 produced excellent "answer sheets."
其中，2019年全年住宅销量突破20.91万套、2324万平方米，同比分别增长25%和30%，一举拿下住房销售套数与销售面积双料销冠；土地市场出让金高达1766亿元，溢价率11.4%，土地出让金额创历史新高，位居全国第五位。
In 2019, housing sales topped 209,100 units and 23.24 million square meters, up 25 percent and 30 percent, respectively, while land sales topped 176.6 billion yuan, representing an 11.4 percent premium.
多家房企负责人在接受《中国经营报》记者采访时表示，还在焦急等待复工部署，在线上售房的同时进行市场研判，希望武汉市相关部门可以出台一些有针对性的、“真金白银”的扶持政策。
In an interview with China Business Daily, several heads of housing companies said they were anxious to resume deployment, online sales while conducting market research, hoping Wuhan relevant departments can issue some targeted, "real gold and silver" support policies.
“公司尚未形成体系化的应对策略，对短期内的市场恢复持悲观态度，但需求延后并意味着消失，随着疫情结束，武汉房地产市场有望企稳回升。
"The company has not yet developed a systemic strategy to deal with the short-term market recovery, but demand is delayed and means vanishing, and with the end of the epidemic, Wuhan real estate market is expected to recover steadily.
”一家全国房企武汉区域公司负责人表示，现在主要是做线上导流，促进老客户线上成交。
Wuhan head of a national housing company said the main now is to do on-line diversion, promoting online transactions for old customers.
花式促销小徐是中南熙悦项目的销售主管，受疫情影响目前还不能返岗。
XiaoXu is the sales director of the ZhongNan Hyatt Project and cannot be returned to work due to the epidemic.
前段时间，他刚通过房天下在线看房直播平台做了两场直播，每场30分钟左右，通过在线直播的方式介绍项目区位、沙盘、户型和商业交通配套以及优惠政策等，回答网友的在线提问并邀请意向客户等疫情结束后到项目实地考察。
Some time ago, he just made two live broadcasts, each for about 30 minutes, of the project location, sand tray, indoor and commercial transportation matching and preferential policies. He answered online questions from netizens and invited the intended customers to visit the project site after the epidemic.
在疫情发生之前，小徐每天都会在项目营销中心向来访意向客户介绍很多遍同样的内容，目前他只能通过线上的方式进行。
Before the outbreak, Xu introduced the same content to prospective customers many times a day at the project's marketing center, and he was able to do so only online.
据了解，目前中南熙悦主推1、2号楼，含装修均价15500元/平方米。
It is understood that at present ZhongNan Hyatt main push 1, 2 building, including decoration average price of 15500 yuan per square metre.
而此前项目推出的5、6号楼，同样户型和房源含装修均价18500元，相当于房价直降3000元/平方米。
And the previous project launched the 5th, 6th building, the same household type and housing source including decoration average price of 18,500 yuan, equivalent to a direct drop in house prices 3000 yuan / square meters.
记者以购房者身份向其了解到，项目的备案均价一直是15500元/平方米左右，这次推出的1、2号楼严格上是全装修免费送。
Reporters to its identity to learn that the average filing price of the project has been around 15500 yuan / square meters, the launch of the 1, 2 is strictly free decoration free delivery.
据小徐介绍，特殊时期给出优惠政策也是为了抢客源。
According to Xu, the special period to give preferential policies is also to snatch customers.
现在只需先缴纳5000元的订金预订一套房源，疫情结束后7天内觉得不合适可以选择“无理由退房”，对于购房者来说这是完全没有风险的。
Now you only have to pay a deposit of 5,000 yuan to book a set of housing resources, 7 days after the end of the epidemic feel inappropriate can choose "no reason to check out," which is completely risk-free for home buyers.
记者在采访中了解到，受售楼部关闭影响，目前各大房企线上看房、售房已经全面铺开，通过开通网上售楼部、置业顾问网上直播、推出无理由退房政策等方式在线售房，已成为武汉房地产行业的标准动作。
Reporters in the interview, by the impact of the closure of the sales department, the main housing enterprises have been fully deployed, through the opening of online sales department, real estate consultants live online, launched no reason to check out policy, and other online sales, real estate industry has become Wuhan standard action.
据不完全统计，房天下网上售楼部已有近500楼盘进驻，覆盖全国性品牌房企武汉区域公司及众多本土品牌房企。
According to incomplete statistics, the Housing World online sales department has nearly 500 buildings, covering the national brand of Wuhan regional companies and a number of local brand housing enterprises.
同时，部分房企采取紧急响应，开发自己的在线售房小程序，在推销楼盘的同时，加强品牌宣传力度。
At the same time, some housing enterprises to take emergency response, development of their own small online sales procedures, while promoting real estate, strengthen brand publicity.
如越秀地产的越秀“房宝”，绿城的“绿城云”，碧桂园的“凤凰云”和融创幸福通等，已运行多年趋于成熟的恒大恒房通也加大了线上推广和折扣力度。
Yuexiu real estate, such as the "house treasure", the "Green City Cloud," the "Phoenix Clouds" and the integration of happiness, has been running for many years to mature, Constant-Heng Housing Tong has also increased on-line promotion and discount.
中国指数研究院华中市场研究中心主任李国政告诉记者，在2月初大部分房企或项目就开始推行线上卖房政策，最开始有点类似“表演式卖房”，表面上很热闹，但“赚吆喝”的成分更多一些，特别是一些全国房企的区域性公司，需要对总部、行业拿出在做事情的姿态来。
Li Guozhong, director of the China Central Market Research Center at the China Institute of Index Research, told reporters that in early February most of the housing companies or projects began to implement an online-house-selling policy, beginning with a bit of a show-and-sell approach.
“现在能线上成交的大多是以刚需盘为主，一些是业主在年前就实地看过项目，已经基本决定购买的，但这段时间突发奇想要买房的几乎没有，总体上线上卖房的效果和数据还不是很理想。
"Now the majority of transactions on the line is just demand, some owners in the field to see the project, has basically decided to buy, but this time a whim to buy almost no, the overall on-line selling effect and data is not very ideal.
”李国政表示，总体上来看，线上购房的效果肯定有，但除了“无理由退房”和少量资金预订房源指标外，还需要有更多配套性的政策和优惠激励，能不能最终转化成有效的成交数据也还需要观察。
Mr Li said that, overall, the effect of online home purchases was certain, but in addition to "no reason to check out" and a small amount of funds to book housing sources, more supportive policies and preferential incentives were needed, and it remained to be seen whether they would eventually translate into effective transaction data.
武汉市房地产开发协会副秘书长张涛也表示，目前各项目已在房天下、安居客和新浪乐居等平台开设线上售楼部和视频直播等方式在线售房，但目前处于初期试运营阶段，效果还没有得到明显显现。
Zhang Tao, deputy secretary-general of Wuhan Real Estate Development Association, said the projects have opened online sales departments and video live broadcasts on various platforms, such as real estate companies, housing tenants and Sina Lodge.
同时受房管局网签关闭等影响，现在还没法签正式的售房合同，也无法接受首付款或全款，在线售房转化为营销数据还需要时间。
At the same time, due to the impact of the Housing Authority sign-off, can not sign a formal contract, or accept a down payment or full payment, online sales into marketing data will take time.
二手房市场“冰封”家住武汉市东湖新技术开发区（中国光谷）安普顿小镇的王智在2019年12月上旬将自住房屋交给了两个中介挂牌出让，“至今还没有人预约看房”。
In early December 2019, Wang Zhi, who lives in the town of Ampleton, Donghu New Technology Development Zone (Gwanggu) in Wuhan, handed over his house to two brokers for sale in the first half of December 2019.
王智这两年在杭州工作，趁回乡探亲的机会希望在光谷片区置换一套停车位充足、有电梯的房源。
Wang Zhi has been working in Hangzhou for the past two years and hopes to replace a car park with an elevator in the Guanggu area.
“当时置换主要是考虑到之前没买停车位，小区停车不方便，再加上房子是楼梯房，在五层没有电梯，老人小孩下楼不方便。
"The replacement was mainly to take into account the lack of parking spaces, the inconvenient parking area, and the fact that the house was a staircase with no elevators on the fifth floor.
”王智告诉记者，房子之前是自己住，东西还没有搬走，不放心把钥匙交给中介，这可能也是中介人员带看不积极、没有人预约看房的原因。
Wang Zhi told reporters that the house was his own house, things have not moved away, do not trust the key to the intermediary, which may also be the intermediary to look inactive, no one booking to see the reasons.
而一个现实是，受武汉市小区封闭等因素影响，实地看房目前已不具可行性。
But a reality is, by Wuhan city small area close influence and so on factor influence, the field sees a room to already have no feasibility at present.
不过，王智对购买二手房充满了信心。
However, Wang Zhi to buy second-hand housing full of confidence.
“疫情过后或许有一波买房的机会，比如此前一些有房产投资行为的中小企业主，会因为资金压力出手。
"There may be a wave of home-buying opportunities after the epidemic, such as some small and medium-sized business owners who have previously invested in real estate, because of capital pressure.
”王智表示，但短期卖房的行情肯定不好，实在不行就先入手一套合适的房源，把安普顿小镇的房子先租出去。
"Wang Zhi said, but short-term housing market is certainly not good, really can not start with a set of suitable housing sources, the town of Ampleton rent out the house.
和王智一样，房地产中介工作人员涂虎还在家中等待复工。
Like Wang Zhi, the real estate agent painted tiger is still at home waiting to return to work.
“现在主要是在家学一些内部培训的课，线上带看也有，不过促成成交比较困难，只能先学点东西提升自己。
"Now mainly from home to learn some in-house training courses, online look also have, but it is difficult to facilitate the transaction, can only learn something to improve themselves.
”涂虎告诉记者，这种情况下，不能实地看房，投资的也很少，基本不会有交易量。
Tu Hu told reporters that this situation, the field can not see the house, investment is also very small, there will be little trading volume.
记者查询贝壳找房等平台发现，武汉多个小区的成交记录都停留在武汉“封城”前的1月22日，近期并没有相关统计数据。
The reporter inquires seashell to look for a room wait for platform to discover, the transaction record of Wuhan many small area stays in Wuhan before "seal" January 22, relevant statistic data is not available recently.
一家全国前十名的房地产经纪机构武汉区域负责人表示，这一波疫情重创了武汉的房产市场，就算预计3月底疫情能得到控制，今年上半年整个市场应该很萧条，新房市场可能复苏得比二手房会快一些。
Wuhan regional director of one of the nation's top 10 real estate brokers said the wave had hit Wuhan's property market and that even if the outbreak was expected to be contained by the end of March, the whole market should be depressed in the first half of this year and the new home market could recover faster than second-hand homes.
但中长期的这种住房刚需跟改善需求预期应该是不变的，下半年应该有机会。
But the medium and long-term housing just needs to be consistent with improved demand expectations, should have the opportunity in the second half of the year.
李国政分析认为，武汉市恢复正常的生活秩序后，有望带动卖旧换新的一波高峰，总体上会呈现出老旧小区短期内更难出手，次新房更抢手的态势。
Li Guosheng analysis, Wuhan after the resumption of normal life order, is expected to promote sales of old for a new wave of peaks, in general will be more difficult to sell the old residential areas, sub-new homes more eagerly.
受这次小区长时间封闭影响，业主对小区物业的服务水平等软服务提出了更高的要求，在追求小区硬件条件的同时更多的考虑社群邻里关系，物业服务质量，这相当于对武汉市物业服务的一次集中检验。
Under the influence of the time closure, the owner demands more soft service, such as the service level of community property, and more consideration for the neighborhood relation and property service quality, which is equivalent to a centralized inspection of property service in Wuhan.
中国指数研究院报告也指出，武汉市二手房市场方面，由于带看量受到影响和抑制，短期二手房量价均将面临下调压力。
China index institute report also pointed out that Wuhan second-hand housing market, because of the impact and inhibition of the volume of short-term second-hand housing prices will face downward pressure.
待市场秩序恢复正常后，二手房挂牌量和成交量将会有所提升，由于置换链条的带动，间接对新房市场也会带来积极影响。
After the market order return to normal, the second-hand housing listing volume and turnover will be increased, because of the replacement chain, indirectly to the new market will also have a positive impact.
急盼政策扶持接受本报记者采访的多位武汉房地产人士均表示，目前都处于居家办公状态，通过线上会议等方式开展日常工作。
Anxious policy to support a number of Wuhan real estate reporters interviewed by the reporter said that at present are in the office from home, through online meetings and other means of daily work.
“通过线上会议、培训等形式密切关注行业变化和提出相应的应对措施，做一些市场研判的工作。
"Pay close attention to industry changes through online meetings, training and other forms of response, do some market research work."
特别是从2月底开始，实际上房企处于普遍焦虑的状态。
Especially since the end of February, the housing sector is in a state of general anxiety.
”上述某全国房企武汉区域公司负责人告诉记者。
The head of Wuhan Regional Housing Company, a national housing company, told reporters.
李国政也表示，通过前期调研发现，目前全国房企在武汉的区域公司也希望能得到总部更多的支持，比如给更多政策、降低考核指标等。
Li also said that through early research found that the current national housing enterprises in Wuhan regional companies also hope to get more support from the headquarters, such as more policies, lower assessment indicators.
目前多数全国房企武汉区域公司都还在密切关注行业变化和进行风险评估，这直接影响总部下放年度考核指标的多少。
At present, most of the regional housing companies in Wuhan are closely monitoring the industry changes and conducting risk assessment, which directly affects the level of the decentralized annual assessment indicators at headquarters.
对于疫情对武汉楼市的影响，多家研究机构持“短期承压、长期向好”的观点。
For the impact of the epidemic on Wuhan real estate market, a number of research institutions hold the "short-term pressure, long-term good" perspective.
“疫情只是延迟了消费者的购房计划，未来被压制的需求有望得到释放，需求仍在，只是有所推后。
"The epidemic has only delayed consumer home purchases, and future pent-up demand is expected to be unleashed and demand is still there, only to be delayed."
”中国指数研究院分析认为，武汉作为2019年全国楼市销冠，在疫情的影响下面临着“短期内新房置业需求将会延缓入市，市场量价将面临下调压力”等新的挑战，但当前疫情影响的挑战和压力都是阶段性、暂时性的，未来武汉市场仍被长期看好。
The China Institute of Index Research says Wuhan, as the nation's top property market for 2019, faces new challenges such as "short-term demand for new homes and downward pressure on market prices" due to the epidemic.
中国指数研究院通过对武汉市近三年的商品住宅市场数据进行分析发现，武汉楼市一季度商品住宅供应及成交全年占比均为最低，且逐年递减。
The index institute of China analyzed the commodity housing market data of Wuhan city in the past three years and found that Wuhan real estate market had the lowest proportion of commodity housing supply and transaction in the first quarter of the year, and decreased year by year.
统计数据显示，2017年至2019年的一季度，武汉住宅量上市占全年的比重分别为15%、13%和11%，同期住宅成交量占全年的比重分别为22%、20%和15%。
According to statistics, Wuhan accounted for 15 percent, 13 percent and 11 percent of residential stock in the first quarter of 2017 to 2019, respectively, while residential turnover accounted for 22 percent, 20 percent and 15 percent, respectively, in the same period.
“2020年1月，武汉市商品住宅成交面积总计134万平方米，同比增长43.1%。
"In January 2020, 1.34 million square meters of commercial housing in Wuhan city were traded, an increase of 43.1 percent year on year.
扣除1月份数据，2、3月份两个月成交量占全年的比例大概在10%，所以不至于太悲观。
Excluding January figures, February and March accounted for about 10% of total volume for the year, so not to be too pessimistic.
”李国政告诉记者，武汉楼市成交量连续多年位居全国前三甚至第一，市场容量大，可伸缩的空间也大。
Li told reporters that Wuhan real estate market volume for many years in a row the top three or even the first, the market capacity is large, scalable space is also large.
尽管业内对武汉楼市长期发展持乐观谨慎态度，但房企面临的短期困境同样不容忽视。
Although the industry is optimistic and cautious about the long-term development of Wuhan real estate market, but the short-term difficulties faced by housing enterprises can not be ignored.
记者在采访中了解到，湖北及武汉多家银行正密切关注房企状况，开展相关调研工作，防止形成不良资产。
During the interview, the reporter learned that many banks in Hubei and Wuhan are paying close attention to the housing situation, carrying out relevant research work to prevent the formation of non-performing assets.
例如，湖北某本土国资银行负责人表示，疫情造成的销售滞后，可能会造成部分房地产开发贷款分期还款计划难以执行，特别是高杠杆企业，银行的地产金融风险承压，出问题的不会多，但单笔金额大，一两个项目就可以影响到一个城市地产金融质量指标。
For example, the head of a home-grown bank in Hubei province said sales delays caused by the outbreak could make it difficult to implement some phased repayment plans for real estate development loans, especially for highly leveraged companies.
李国政表示，和全国其他地方出台一些扶持政策不同，武汉目前的精力主要还是在防疫上，至今没有出台相关政策。
Li said, and other parts of the country to launch some supportive policies, Wuhan is still focused on immunization, so far no relevant policies.
房企也大多处于观望状态，普遍希望主管部门能有重磅扶持政策“大礼包”出台，所以房企现在能给的优惠政策并不大，如果相关部门到时候能拿出“真金白银”提振信心的政策，对于整个行业的预期引导还是很有帮助的。
Housing companies are also mostly in the wait-and-see state, the general hope that the competent authorities will have a "big package" support policy, so housing companies can now give little preferential policies, if the relevant departments can then come up with "real silver" policies to boost confidence, the industry as a whole is expected to help.
张涛也告诉记者，大多数房企还在就市场状况开展研判工作，短期看疫情结束时间，中期看政策支持力度，全年看武汉经济社会发展能否快速恢复元气。
Zhang Tao also told reporters that most of the housing enterprises are still on the market conditions for the end of the short-term look at the end of the epidemic, the medium-term policy support, to see whether Wuhan economic and social development can recover quickly.
随着城市恢复生产和正常生活，房地产业也有望快速回归正轨。
With the resumption of urban production and normal life, the real estate industry is expected to quickly return to normal.
“我们和房地产主管部门有过多次沟通，但工作人员已大多按规定下沉到社区执行帮扶任务，而不是在办公室正常上班，现在来看，相关政策在短期内出台还有很多现实困难。
"We had a lot of communication with the real estate authorities, but most of the staff went down to the community to do things instead of going to the office, and it seems there are real difficulties in the short term.
”张涛表示，对于房地产企业来说，中短期影响因素明朗之后，才能做出更明确的判断。
Zhang Tao said that for real estate companies, the short- and medium-term impact of the factors clear, before making a clearer judgement.
“希望相关部门在疫情得到有效控制后，积极引导市民恢复置业信心；在可行的情况下引导房企尽快有序复工，同时在坚持‘房住不炒’的总基调下，给出一些切实可行的政策支持。
"It is hoped that the relevant departments will actively guide the public to regain their confidence after the outbreak is effectively controlled, guide the housing enterprises to resume work as soon as practicable, and give some practical policy support under the general tenor of 'no fire and housing'."
”张涛建议。
