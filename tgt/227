At the beginning of the New Year, the FM interviewed five ordinary Wuhan people and asked them to tell their true feelings about being in an epidemic area at this time.
今天我们要播出的是一位医生的自述，他现在是武汉一家三甲医院心内科的住院医师。
Today we're going to air the story of a doctor who is a resident of the department of cardiology at a three-A hospital in Wuhan.
-1-决定留守我叫三三，现在是武汉一家三甲医院的心内科住院医师。
-1- Decided to stay with me. My name is Three Three, and I'm a resident of a three-A hospital in Wuhan.
新型冠状病毒这个事情我们大概在一月初的时候就知道了。
We've known about this new coronavirus since about the beginning of January.
因为武汉这边三甲医院的医生，很多不是武汉大学就是华中科技大学毕业的，圈子很小，所以消息流转非常快。
Because Wuhan side of Sanjia hospital doctors, many are either Wuhan University or Huazhong University of Science and Technology graduates, the circle is very small, so the flow of information is very fast.
当时是武汉市中心医院的一个医生在同学群里面，就是在协和 15 级的什么群里面发出来这个资料，我们学医的一看那个 CT，就知道是病毒肺。
It was a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital who sent this information in a group of students, in what group of Concorde 15. Our medical examiner looked at the CT and saw that it was a viral lung.
武汉市中心医院当时让病人自费做了病毒基因检测，检测的结果是它跟冠状病毒相似度 70%，所以那个医生才敢说是「新的非典」。
Wuhan Central Hospital asked the patient to do a viral genetic test at his own expense, and the test showed that it was 70% similar to the coronavirus, so the doctor dared to call it the New SARS.
我们主任比较好，一月初他发现这个事情就在科室里跟我们讲了。
Our director was better, and in early January he found out that he had told us about it in the office.
然后，我们医院在一月的前两个星期就已经调整发热门诊的人数，做好准备了。
Then, in the first two weeks of January, our hospital was readjusted for the fever clinic.
但是官方这个时候说「没有人传人」，可能是怕引起恐慌吧。
But when officials say "no one is passing on", it may be for fear of causing panic.
■1 月 23 日上午，汉口火车站工作人员在进站口封锁铁栅栏。
▪ On the morning of 23 January, Hankou railway station staff blocked the iron fence at the entrance gate.
图/财新网 拍摄/丁刚我当时还想着，大年二十九值完夜班之后就回家过年，初十之后再回来上班，但后面情况就越来越严重了。
I was thinking that I would go home after the night shift and come back to work after the 10th birthday, but the situation became more and more serious.
一月十几日我们这就出现了感染的情况，我们就开始自己买 N95 口罩、紫外线消毒灯、药品，这些都是自备。
When we had an infection on January 10, we started buying our own N95 masks, ultraviolet disinfectant lamps, and medicines, all of which were self-provided.
我那时候还觉得无所谓。
It didn't matter to me back then.
真正慌的时候是 1 月 23 日武汉封城，没有想到这个病毒传播性这么强。
The real panic is the January 23 closure of Wuhan, did not expect the virus to spread so strong.
我老家在武汉下面一个县城里。
My hometown is in a county below Wuhan.
我就让老婆先回去了，我一直纠结自己回不回去。
I let my wife go back first, I have been entangled that I can not go back.
22 日抢口罩的时候，我本来说我要回去，我们主任说了一句，「你这不负责任，你在医院里面待过，你再回去就不怕传播给别人？」这句话到后面我想了好几天，大年二十八我就跟科室说，我今年就不回家过年了，如果有任务可以安排我上。
On the 22nd, I said that I would go back, our director said, "You are irresponsible, you stay in the hospital, you go back, you are not afraid to spread to others?"
其实最终让我下定决心的，是我们同一批进来的一个同事。
In fact, it was one of our co-workers who finally made up my mind.
他当时去了发热门诊，然后告诉我，封城之前他在门诊看了 188 个病人，其中 88 个 CT 显示是阳性，所以封城前这个病情就比较严重了。
He went to the fever clinic and told me that he had seen 188 patients at the clinic before the siege, 88 of whom were positive on CT, so it was more serious before the siege.
所以我才决定不能回去，因为我多多少少也算暴露过几次，自己即使没有问题，不代表没有携带。
That's why I decided not to go back, because I've been exposed more or less a few times, and even if I have no problem, it doesn't mean I don't have it.
还好封城之后，通过政府的宣传，现在大家都知道怎么回事了。
Fortunately, after the closure of the city, through government propaganda, everyone now knows what happened.
现在 CT 阳性的话，我们只能叫疑似病例。
Now that CT is positive, we can only call a suspicious case.
因为确诊要用基因盒，这个我们非常紧缺。
Because we need a gene box for diagnosis, We're in a very short supply.
但是我们有一个标准，就是看 CT 是不是病毒肺。
But we have a standard, is to see whether CT is viral lung.
只要他 CT 上显示是病毒肺，这个人就应该八九不离十能确定感染了。
As long as he shows a viral lung on CT, this person should be absolutely certain of the infection.
这个病毒传染性非常强，我们科室目前有三、四个人在隔离病房，前两天基因检测后已经确诊了。
This virus is very infectious, our department now have three or four people in the isolation ward, the first two days of genetic testing has been confirmed.
因为我们有一个心内科去呼吸内科的会诊，不知道当时有没有接触到病人，可能去过那个病房就被感染了。
Because we had a cardiology consultation with the respiratory department, I didn't know if I had any contact with the patient, I might have been in that ward and got infected.
后来我们就在科室里讨论了一下感染的主要症状。
Later we discussed the main symptoms of infection in the department.
它不是看你有没有发热，或者流鼻涕、打喷嚏这些感冒的症状。
It's not about whether you have a fever or runny noses or sneezes that are symptoms of colds.
它最先出现的症状是，我们看病人有没有乏力和有没有胃口。
The first symptom is that we see if the patient is weak and has no appetite.
如果出现乏力、没有胃口，我们就建议去做个 CT，确诊一下。
If the emergence of fatigue, no appetite, we suggest to do a CT, diagnosis.
■讲述者提供的病毒肺的 CT 图-2-科室与医院的现状因为我们是心内科，现在属于二线科室了。
:: CT Diagram-2 of the Virus Lung provided by the narrator -- Departments and Hospitals Because we are in the Department of Cardiology, we are now in the second-line department.
封城前一个星期，我们医院就开始组织发热门诊、隔离病房。
A week before the closure of the city, our hospital began to organize fever clinics, isolation rooms.
原来一个病房是三张床，可以放三个病人。
It used to be a ward with three beds for three patients.
隔离病房为了防止交叉感染，只能放一个病人。
The isolation ward can only accommodate one patient to prevent cross-infection.
所以原来呼吸科的病人就转到我们这些二线科室去了。
So the respiratory patients went to our second-line departments.
我们目前安排的班是一个人上 24 小时，然后休息 6 天。
We currently have a 24-hour shift and a six-day break.
因为现在又开了几个呼吸内科，就抽调了好多医生去发热门诊和隔离病房。
Now that a few more respiratory departments have been opened, a number of doctors have been transferred to the fever clinic and isolation ward.
护士也抽掉了不少，去其他科室或者去支持金银潭这样的医院。
Nurses also siphoned off and went to other departments or to support hospitals like Gold and Silver Pool.
非典的时候，因为大剂量使用激素治疗，很多病人治愈后留下了严重的后遗症。
SARS, because of the use of large doses of hormone treatment, many patients after the cure left a serious sequelae.
但这次到目前还没有看到有大剂量使用激素。
But so far no large doses of the hormone have been seen.
如果高烧不退的话，会使用小剂量的，这个是正常范围之内的。
If the fever does not return, will use a small dose, this is normal range.
我们临床都会用的。
We'll all use it clinically.
但是如果你的肺炎感染得很重，将来多多少少都会留下一点东西。
But if you get a bad case of pneumonia, you'll leave a little more or less in the future.
就怕出现肺纤维化之类的情况。
Fear of pulmonary fibrosis and something like that.
年轻的时候可能没什么，年老的时候就比较容易发生感染。
It may not matter when you are young, but it is more likely to get infected in old age.
目前武汉所有的医院，基本上都处于没有床位的状态，病人收不进去，除非你特别危重。
At present, all the hospitals in Wuhan, basically in a state of no beds, patients can not go in, unless you are particularly critical.
像轻微和中度的病人，都是让他们回家自我隔离、吃药，这是没办法的事情。
People with mild to moderate illnesses are forced to go home to isolate themselves and take medication, which is impossible.
我现在看到一般门诊基本上没有什么病人了，以前大厅都是排满人的，现在就零零散散几个人。
I see now that the general clinic is almost empty. The halls used to be full of people, but now there are a few scattered people.
但是发热门诊人很多，排很长的队。
But there's a lot of people at the fever clinic, long queues.
而且晚上还比白天人多，可能他们怕小区的邻居知道自己来看病。
And there are more people at night than during the day. Maybe they are afraid that the neighborhood will know they are coming to see the doctor.
■1 月 22 日，红十字会医院，前来就诊的发热患者挤满楼道。

图/财新网拍摄/蔡颖莉-3-紧缺的防护物资作为二线的医生，我现在每天的工作有点尴尬。
Photo / Caixin Filming / Cai Yingli-3 - Scarcity of protective equipment As a second-line doctor, I am now working a little awkwardly.
除了该上班的时候上班，每天就是自我隔离，然后在群里填各种爱心组织捐赠的申请表单，帮科室抢一下物资。
In addition to the time to work, the daily isolation, and then in the group filled out various charitable organizations donated application forms to help departments grab supplies.
因为我们医院很多东西都没有了，像口罩、防护服、护目镜，这些东西都是没有的。
Because our hospital has a lot of things, such as masks, protective clothing, goggles, these things are not.
其实，对于隔离病房来说，物资的使用有严格的要求。
In fact, for the isolation ward, the use of materials has strict requirements.
比如普通的外科口罩，真正有效期大概就是 3~4 个小时，N95 的话可能就 4~6 个小时。
For example, a normal surgical mask may be valid for three to four hours, or four to six hours for N95.
但因为我们缺物资，所以一戴就是一天。
But because we are short of supplies, we wear it for a day.
现在还出现了一种现象，像我们在二线科室的，N95 口罩用完一天之后，我们拿去水龙头下接水，看它漏不漏水，没漏水的话应该还能用，就拿酒精消消毒、放在紫外线灯上消下毒，然后继续用。
Now there's a phenomenon where, like our second-line department, a day after the N95 mask is used, we take it under the faucet to pick it up, see if it doesn't leak, or if it doesn't leak, then sterilize it with alcohol, put it out on a UV light and keep using it.
特别是隔离服、护目镜和 N95 这种物资，不属于医院的平常需要，所以它们的储备量都不会特别大。
In particular, supplies such as protective clothing, goggles and N95 are not part of the normal needs of hospitals, so their stocks will not be particularly large.
但是我们员工就有 1000 多人，加上每天的消耗，慢慢就没有了。
But our staff of more than 1000, plus the daily consumption, slowly disappeared.
前几天，协和医院是第一家直接向外界求援的，他们做了之后，我们这些医院才跟着也向社会求援。
The other day, Concorde Hospital was the first person to turn directly to the outside world for help. After they did, our hospitals followed suit.
昨天在微博上看到协和西院的护士没有口罩，自己用手术衣的材料自己剪。
I saw the Concorde West Hospital nurse without a mask yesterday, cutting herself with the material of her surgical gown.
他们已经到了这种地步，比我们更惨。
They've reached this point. More than we did.
因为武汉红十字会这个物资还没有分配下来，反正我没有领到过红十字会的东西。
Because Wuhan Red Cross this material has not been distributed, anyway I have not received anything from the Red Cross.
所以我们基本上都在抢物资，争取爱心人士捐助的口罩这些东西，然后我们为科室和医院出点力。
So we basically grab supplies, get people to donate masks and stuff, and then we do something for the department and the hospital.
■2 月 1 日，武汉国际博览中心的红会临时仓库，工作人员在仓库内清点、登记。
▪ On 1 February, the temporary warehouse of the Red Cross Society of Wuhan International Expo Center was opened, and staff counted and registered in the warehouse.
多家医疗单位等候领取物资，直到下午才领到少量离开。
Several medical units waited for supplies until the afternoon, when they received a small number of departures.
图/财新网拍摄/丁刚-4-准备被召唤我现在在等着随时被召唤上一线。
Photo / Caixin Filming / Ding Gang-4 - Ready for Call I am now waiting to be called on the line at any time.
前两天就已经练习了怎么做二级防护，包括穿衣服怎么穿，我们都有一个流程标准的。
The other two days have been practicing how to do secondary protection, including how to wear clothes, we all have a flow standard.
我们主任要我背了几遍。
Our director asked me to repeat it several times.
去发热门诊我自己最担心的主要是医闹行为。
The main thing that worries me most about going to the fever clinic is the mishandling behavior.
之前不是有一个被确诊的嘛，那个家属把医生给打了，结果医生严重暴露了。
There wasn't one diagnosed before, but the family beat the doctor, and the doctor exposed it badly.
还有扯医生的口罩、吐痰这种事情。
And pulling on a doctor's mask, spitting.
其实最麻烦的还是心理压力，但我觉得我的抗压能力还好。
In fact, the most troublesome or psychological pressure, but I think my anti-stress ability is good.
我印象最深刻是大年初一，我们科室有一个女生出现了发热的情况，她心态就崩了。
I was most impressed by the New Year's Day, our department has a girl feverish situation, her mentality on the collapse.
后来还好，她只是普通的感冒，就回家自我隔离去了。
Fortunately, she was just a common cold, so she went home to isolate herself.
我能理解大家心里的恐慌，这个病毒的确要重视，但是不需要恐慌。
I can understand the fear in everyone's heart that this virus really should be valued, but there is no need to panic.
因为它虽然传染性高，但是它的死亡率不是很高，基本上死亡病人多多少少都合并了一些基础病，身体比较衰弱的，所以扛不住。
Because it is infectious, but its mortality is not very high, basically the death patients are more or less a combination of some basic diseases, relatively weak, so can not carry.
我在发热门诊的那个同事自己统计了一下，发现三十岁左右的发病率不到 5%。
My colleague at the fever clinic counted himself and found a prevalence rate of less than 5% in their 30s.
我们医院的隔离病房好像还没有出现死亡的，有几个用了药之后还出院了。
The isolation ward in our hospital didn't seem to have died, and several of them were discharged after taking the medicine.
死亡率不高，我们也不就不那么担心了。
With a low mortality rate, we're not so worried.
所以说还是一个抵抗力的问题。
So it's still a matter of resistance.
你不如趁着这一段在家的时间，吃好喝好休息好，调整好自己的心态，别信那些偏方。
You might as well take advantage of this time at home, eat and drink good rest, adjust your own mentality, do not believe those prescriptions.
如果说双黄连能抑制病毒的话，那我想说，白开水也有抑制作用呢。
If Shuanghuanglian can inhibit the virus, then I would like to say that boiled water also has inhibition.
大家如果都有点医学常识的话，就不会相信这些东西。
If everyone had a little medical knowledge, they wouldn't believe it.
