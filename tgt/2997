”随着出现首例因感染新冠病毒死亡的病例，英国开始准备升级防控措施，升级后的措施或包括关闭学校、取消大型聚会、在家办公。
With the first death from the new crown virus, the U.K. is preparing to step up prevention and control measures that could include closing schools, canceling large gatherings and working from home.
截至3月5日，英国确诊病例上升到116人。
As of March 5, the number of confirmed cases in the UK had risen to 116.
与两天前的51例相比，确诊人数在48小时内翻了一倍。
The number of confirmed cases doubled in 48 hours, compared with 51 two days ago.
英国为应对疫情设计了四阶段方案，目前正在为进入第二阶段做准备。
The United Kingdom has designed a four-phase programme to respond to the epidemic and is now preparing for the second phase.
首相发言人警告，病毒很有可能“以显著方式传播”。
A spokesman for the prime minister warned that the virus was likely to "spread in a significant way."
英国当地华人告诉界面新闻，公司目前还在正常上班，但员工之间已经禁止握手。
Local Chinese told Interface News the company was still at work, but shaking hands was banned.
首例死亡，本地感染？据BBC新闻和《卫报》3月5日报道，一名70多岁的女性新冠确诊患者于当地时间周四在英格兰雷丁镇的一所医院去世。
A 70-year-old woman diagnosed with the new crown died Thursday at a hospital in Reading, England, the BBC News reported Thursday.
医院声明显示，该患者此前因其他疾病多次出入医院，本周三因疑似感染新冠病毒接受检测。
A hospital statement said the patient, who had been hospitalized several times for other illnesses, was tested Wednesday for a suspected new crown virus.
到周四早上检测结果出炉时，患者已经死亡。
By the time the test results were available Thursday morning, the patient was dead.
英国首席医疗官惠蒂（Chris Whitty）称，该患者此前没有前往海外，据推测为在英国本地感染。
Chris Whitty, chief medical officer, said the patient had not previously travelled overseas and was presumed to have been infected locally in the UK.
患者此前也没有接触过新冠确诊病人，当局正在追查与患者有过密切接触的人士。
The patient has not been contacted before, and authorities are pursuing people who have been in close contact with the patient.
图片来源：BBC随着确诊人数上升，英国加强了对从意大利返回英国人士的限制，要求从意返英的所有人员如果出现身体不适，需在家自行隔离。
http: / / www.bbs.cn As the number of confirmed cases has risen, Britain has tightened restrictions on the return of people from Italy to the UK, requiring all those returning to the UK to stay at home if they feel unwell.
与此同时，英国当局还宣布部分确诊病人将在家接受治疗，而非送往医院。
Meanwhile, the British authorities have announced that some confirmed patients will be treated at home rather than sent to hospital.
在116名确诊患者中，有约45人在家进行隔离治疗。
Some 45 of the 116 confirmed patients were treated in isolation at home.
惠蒂称，在医务人员帮助下，轻症患者在家接受隔离治疗“更为安全”，而“任何需要入院治疗的患者将被送往医院”。
Wheattie said it was "safer" for light patients to be treated in isolation at home with the help of medical staff, while "anyone who needed hospital treatment would be sent to hospital."
据英格兰公共卫生部传染病控制中心副主任霍普金斯（Susan Hopkins）介绍，在家接受隔离治疗的患者都严格遵照了隔离规定，“很多在自己卧室隔离，只有吃饭的时候会走出房间，拿了食物后又回房”。
According to Susan Hopkins, deputy director of the Infectious Diseases Control Centre at the Department of Public Health in England, patients who are treated in isolation at home strictly adhere to the quarantine, "many of whom are isolated in their own bedrooms and walk out of their rooms to get food and then go back to their homes."
截至目前，英国共有12名患者治愈。
So far, 12 patients have been cured in Britain.
与此同时，确诊患者中至少有八例不清楚感染来源，这些患者此前都没有到过海外，也没有与其他确诊患者接触。
At the same time, at least eight cases of confirmed patients, none of whom had previously been overseas or contacted other confirmed patients, were not aware of the source of the infection.
英国首相发言人表示，当局将继续采取措施防止疫情扩散，“但现在很有可能发生的是，病毒将以显著方式传播”。
A spokesman for the British prime minister said the authorities would continue to take steps to prevent the spread of the disease, "but it is now highly likely that the virus will spread in a significant way."
首相约翰逊重申，目前英国依然处于疫情应对的第一阶段，即“控制”阶段。
Prime Minister Johnson reiterated that the United Kingdom is still in the first phase of the response to the epidemic, the "control" phase.
但医务人员已经开始为进入第二阶段“推迟”扩散做准备。
But medical staff are already preparing for a second phase of "delayed" proliferation.
“四步走”防控面临大考为应对新冠疫情，英国制定了四阶段防控方案，视情况发展决定是否升级。
In response to the new Crown outbreak, the United Kingdom has developed a four-phase prevention and control plan, depending on the development of whether or not to upgrade.
第一阶段为“控制”，在早期及时发现感染者，追踪密切接触者，尽可能阻止新冠肺炎的扩散传播。
The first stage is "control," early detection of infection, tracking close contacts, as far as possible to prevent the spread of new crown pneumonia.
这一策略是为了防止民众大量涌入医疗机构，造成医疗物资短缺。
The strategy is to prevent a massive influx of people into health facilities, resulting in a shortage of medical supplies.
但作为准备，医院需对患者的可能涌入做好预案，每所医院都需准备隔离区；当局也为医务人员提供了额外医疗设备和个人防护装备。
In preparation, however, the hospital had to plan for a possible influx of patients and prepare an area of separation for each hospital; it also provided additional medical equipment and personal protective equipment for medical personnel.
英国已要求30所医院待命准备接受新冠确诊病人。
Britain has asked 30 hospitals to be on standby for newly diagnosed patients.
一旦疫情出现大流行，这30所医院将取消常规治疗，优先接收新冠肺炎患者。
In the event of a pandemic, the 30 hospitals will eliminate routine treatment and give priority to new cases of pneumonia.
目前大部分患者都在英格兰的五所专门医院接受治疗。
Most of the patients are being treated in five specialist hospitals in England.
第二阶段为“推迟”扩散。
The second stage is "delayed" proliferation.
如果控制措施失效，确诊病例激增，当局将启动第二阶段措施。
If control measures fail and there is a surge in confirmed cases, the authorities will initiate the second phase.
这一阶段主要是为了扩大人与人之间的“安全距离”。
The main purpose of this stage is to expand the "safe distance" between people.
目前英国政府内部还在就具体应该采取哪些手段进行讨论，建议的措施包括关闭学校、限制公共交通的使用、停止大型集会、鼓励员工在家上班等。
There are ongoing discussions within the British government on what should be done, including closing schools, restricting the use of public transport, stopping large gatherings and encouraging employees to work from home.
如果推迟扩散方案失败，当局将启动第三阶段方案“研究”——加强对病毒扩散方式和治疗手段的研究。
If the delay fails, the authorities will launch the third phase of the program, "Research," to strengthen research into how the virus spreads and how it can be treated.
英国政府希望将新冠病毒肺炎的爆发高峰推迟到夏天，为研究和国家医疗服务体系的应对创造更多时间。
The British government wants to delay the peak of the outbreak until summer, creating more time for research and a response from the NHS.
此前，英国已经投入4000万英镑用于研发疫苗，候选疫苗目前处于临床试验阶段。
The UK has already invested ￡40m in vaccine development and the candidate vaccine is in clinical trials.
第四阶段方案为“缓和”压力。
The fourth stage of the programme is "palliative" pressure.
如果该方案启用，说明疫情已经在英国大规模扩散，也就是最严重的情况。
If the plan goes live, it would mean that the epidemic has spread in Britain on a massive scale, the worst case scenario.
届时，医疗机构和整个社会所承受的压力已经“越来越大，能被清楚感受到”。
By then, the pressure on health-care institutions and society as a whole will be "greater and greater, and clearly felt."
一旦进入这一阶段，如果出现警力不足，警方将把重点放在处理严重犯罪案件和维护公共秩序上。
Once at this stage, in the event of a lack of police presence, the police will focus on dealing with serious crimes and maintaining public order.
英国国家医疗服务体系（NHS）将仅针对重症患者开放，退休的NHS员工将被重新召回。
The NHS will be open only to patients in serious condition, and retired NHS staff will be recalled.
这一阶段的方案是为了确保最急需治疗的病患能得到医治，医疗工作者能得到相应的支持，以减缓疫情对整个社会和经济造成的影响。
This phase of the programme is designed to ensure that those most in need of treatment have access to treatment and that health-care workers receive appropriate support to mitigate the social and economic impact of the epidemic.
疫情扩散，防护品脱销周四，英国首席医疗官惠蒂在对卫生和社会保健委员会讲话时警告，流行病学模型预测疫情近期将在英国扩散，在三周时间里，NHS就将面对可能出现病例总数的50%，九周时间里将达到90%。
WHITE, Britain's chief medical officer, warned Thursday in an address to the Health and Social Care Commission that epidemiological models predicted the epidemic would spread across the UK in the near term, with the NHS facing 50 percent of all cases in three weeks and 90 percent in nine weeks.
惠蒂表示，为做好准备，NHS需要将部分常规治疗推迟到疫情爆发高峰之后或提前。
Whitty said the NHS would need to delay some routine treatment until after or before the peak of the outbreak.
退休医生则可以被召回，年龄过大的退休医生可以参与非一线工作，包括在NHS热线电话111为民众提供咨询服务。
Retired doctors can be recalled, and over-aged retired doctors can engage in non-frontline work, including counselling on the NHS hotline 111.
本周二，惠蒂向媒体预测了英国最糟糕的情况——80%的人口被感染，但他强调实际感染情况可能远低于该数字。
On Tuesday, Whitty told the press about the worst-case scenario in Britain, where 80 percent of the population was infected, but stressed that the actual infection rate could be far below that figure.
至于如何做好个人防护，约翰逊在同一天的讲话中表示，最重要的手段依然是用肥皂洗手，洗手的时长相当于“‘祝你生日快乐’歌唱两遍的长度”。
Johnson said in a statement on the same day that washing hands with soap was still the most important tool and that washing hands was equivalent to 'Happy Birthday to You' singing twice.
他同时强调，对于其他没有感染病毒的民众，“我们应该一切照旧”。
He also stressed that for others not infected with the virus, "we should do business as usual."
生活在英格兰西约克郡利兹的华人小崔告诉界面新闻，现在已经无法买到口罩，但街上没有人戴口罩，“媳妇有时候出门戴口罩，总感觉有人躲着她”。
Little Cui, a Chinese living in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, told UI News it was no longer possible to buy masks, but nobody on the street wore masks. "Daughter-in-law sometimes goes out wearing masks and feels like someone is hiding from her."
口罩脱销后，有朋友向小崔兜售，出价35英镑50个。
After the mask was out of stock, a friend offered to sell it to Cui for 35 pounds and 50 units.
小崔没有买，“感觉用不到”。
Little Cui did not buy, "I don't feel like it."
小崔所在的公司依然正常上班，但已经要求员工之间不要握手，进办公室需先洗手。
Mr. Cui's company is still at work, but has asked employees not to shake hands and wash their hands before entering the office.
公司午休的地方已经暂停开放，一些出国的差旅计划取消，但英国国内的出差依然照旧。
The company's lunchtime break has been suspended and some travel plans abroad have been canceled, but business in the UK remains as usual.
由于公司的性质，小崔认为今后远程在家办公的可能性不大。
Because of the nature of the company, Cui believes that telecommuting is unlikely in the future.
公司也没有提过远程办公，现在只是利用空间，让同事的座位比以前更分散。
The company also did not mention telecommuting, but is now just using space to make co-workers more dispersed than before.
当地银行和警察局的柜台上也开始放出消毒液。
Sterilization also began to be released from counters at local banks and police stations.
虽然身边的朋友同事经常说起疫情，小崔没有感觉到大家很紧张。
Although the friends around the colleagues often talk about the epidemic, Xiao Cui did not feel that everyone was very nervous.
但近几日，社交媒体上放出了英国超市里消毒液被抢空的照片，对此，小崔感叹“还好我们买的比较早”。
But in recent days, social media have released pictures of disinfectant being taken out of British supermarkets, for which Cui lamented, "Fortunately we bought it earlier."
