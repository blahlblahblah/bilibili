A member of the Central Steering Group, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and President of Tianjin University of Chinese Medicine Zhang Boli, gave an interview to the People's Daily's new media in Wuhan on March 3.
疫情防控形势接下来会如何发展？大家什么时候才能“摘口罩”？新冠病毒会不会常态化，变成慢性病？看这位已在抗“疫”一线奋战一个多月的老兵怎么说。
What will happen next? When will we be able to "take off the mask"? Will the new crown virus become a chronic disease? See what the veteran has been fighting for more than a month.
新增病例到什么时候才能“清零”？张伯礼：我们分析了疫情演变数据，目前来看，全国除湖北以外其他地区，2月底新增病例基本“清零”；湖北省除武汉市以外其他地区，3月中旬估计能基本“清零”；武汉市有希望到3月底实现基本“清零”。
When will the new cases get to zero? Zhang: We have analyzed the data of the epidemic's evolution, and at the end of February there were basically zero new cases in all regions except Hubei, and in mid-March in Hubei Province, except Wuhan, it is expected to be basically "zero" by the end of March.
从疫情整体发展趋势看，是这样的。
From the overall trend of the epidemic, this is the case.
但是，“清零”也不是绝对的，偶尔还是会出现几个新增病例。
But, "clear zero" also is not absolute, still can appear occasionally a few new cases.
什么时候才能“摘口罩”？张伯礼：估计4月底除了湖北以外，全国其他省市基本就可以摘口罩恢复正常生活生产秩序。
Zhang: It is estimated that at the end of April, all provinces and municipalities except Hubei will be able to remove masks and resume normal life and order.
湖北省特别是武汉市，可能要比全国晚1个月左右。
Hubei province, especially Wuhan city, may be about a month later than the whole country.
但是，我不主张那么着急摘口罩，即使复工复产，恢复正常秩序了，口罩还是慢一点摘比较好。
However, I do not advocate so anxious to take masks, even if the resumption of work to restore normal order, or slow down the mask pick better.
就算全国都“清零”了，少聚集、勤洗手、戴口罩的好习惯，也要保持一段时间。
Even if the whole country "clean", less gathering, frequent hand-washing, wearing masks good habits, but also to maintain a period of time.
毕竟，现在疫情下半场国外的形势还是很严峻，要防范输入性病例。
After all, the situation abroad is still very serious in the second half of the epidemic, to prevent imported cases.
我希望，大家不要把注意力过多地放在什么时间摘口罩这个问题上，养成良好的生活习惯才是最重要的。
I hope you don't focus too much on when to take off your mask. Getting into good habits is the most important thing.
在武汉一个多月，都干了哪些事？张伯礼：1月27日我刚到武汉的时候，形势非常严峻、复杂：患者和非患者混在一起，发热的、留观的、密接的、疑似的，这“四类人”很多都没有被隔离，非常混乱。
Zhang: When I first arrived in Wuhan on January 27th, the situation was very serious and complicated: patients and non-patients mixed together, feverish, observant, dense and suspected.
大医院被挤爆，排队几小时看不上病，确诊病例也住不了院，一床难求……当时我们就向中央指导组提出，分层分类管理，集中隔离，分别处理。
The major hospitals were crowded, queued up for hours to see the disease, confirmed cases can not live in hospital, a bed difficult... then we proposed to the Central Steering Group, hierarchical classification management, centralized isolation, separate treatment.
同时，对于确诊患者也要分类管理，轻症、重症分开治疗，可以占用学校、酒店，这样可以有效地利用有限的卫生资源。
At the same time, patients should also be classified management, light disease, severe separation treatment, can occupy schools, hotels, so that the limited health resources can be used effectively.
但是，当时很多患者因为没有确诊，就没有得到有效的救治，只是被简单隔离了，情绪恐慌、救治无助。
However, at that time, because many patients did not diagnosed, did not receive effective treatment, but was simply isolated, emotional panic, helpless treatment.
当时我们根据以往经验就建议，对“四类人员”全部给中药，因为无论是对于普通感冒、流感，还是新冠肺炎，中药都是有一定疗效的。
At the time, we suggested, based on past experience, that all four categories of people should be given Chinese medicine, which is effective against common cold, influenza and pneumonia.
先吃上药稳住情绪，一二天退热了，就有信心了。
First take medicine to calm the mood, a day or two after the heat, there is confidence.
之后，随着确诊患者越来越多，一床难求，解决不了应收尽收的问题，专家建议建立方舱医院收治轻症患者。
Since then, with more patients diagnosed, a bed is difficult to find, can not solve the problem of receivable, experts recommend the establishment of a cabin hospital to treat patients with light illness.
我和刘清泉教授写了请战书，提出中医药进方舱，中医承办方舱医院。
Professor Liu Qingquan and I wrote the invitation letter, proposed the Chinese medicine into the cabin, TCM contractor Fang cabin hospital.
中央指导组同意后，我们就组建了第一支中医医疗队，由天津、江苏、河南、湖南、陕西的209位中医专家，筹建了江夏方舱医院，里面主要采用中医药综合治疗。
With the approval of the Central Steering Group, we have established the first medical team of Chinese medicine, with 209 Chinese medicine specialists from Tianjin, Jiangsu, Henan, Hunan and Shaanxi provinces, and set up the Jiangxia Fangzhou Hospital, which mainly uses Chinese medicine comprehensive treatment.
取得经验后，现在所有的方舱医院几乎都在使用中药了。
After gaining experience, almost all cabin hospitals now use traditional Chinese medicine.
目前，工作重点放在了对重症患者的救治上，中央指导组下达指示，组建中西医联合会诊组，对武汉市的重症病人进行一对一会诊，建立一对一包括中医药的诊治方案。
At present, the focus of the work is on the treatment of serious patients, the Central Steering Group issued instructions to form a joint Chinese and Western medical consultation team to conduct one-on-one consultations with severe patients in Wuhan and establish a one-to-one programme of Chinese medicine diagnosis and treatment.
经过几轮会诊，目前看还是有效果的，武汉患者死亡人数在逐步下降，从百位降到几十了。
After several rounds of consultation, it is still effective at present, Wuhan patients in the death toll is gradually falling, from 100 to dozens.
现在，我们又在考虑恢复期的病人。
Now, we're thinking about convalescent patients.
一些出院的病人特别是重症患者康复问题。
Some discharged patients, especially the seriously ill, had rehabilitation problems.
有的出院了，但还有症状，咳嗽、喘憋、心悸、乏力等；有些肺部感染渗出吸收不完全，有的免疫功能紊乱等。
Some have been discharged from the hospital but still have symptoms such as cough, wheezing, palpitation, weakness, etc.; some lung infections are not fully absorbed, some are immune disorders, etc.
我们就在湖北省中西医结合医院、武汉市中医院建立了新冠患者康复门诊，专门管理治疗这部分病人。
We have set up a rehabilitation clinic for new crown patients in Hubei and Wuhan TCM hospitals to manage and treat this part of the patients.
在中国工程院和有关单位支持下，我们还组织了武汉协和医院、武汉市中医院共同建立湖北感染新冠的医务人员康复管理平台，这将是今后一两年的任务。
With the support of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and relevant units, we have organized Wuhan Concorde Hospital and Wuhan Chinese Hospital to jointly establish a platform for the rehabilitation and management of medical personnel infected with the new crown in Hubei Province, which will be a task for the next year or two.
如何看待此次疫情中，关于中西医孰强的争论？张伯礼：在这场战“疫”中，中医和西医是非常和谐的。
Zhang: In this battle, Chinese medicine and western medicine are in perfect harmony.
特别是在重症病人的抢救过程中，以西医为主，中医为辅，但是有时辅助也起关键作用，已经有很多例子了。
Especially in the rescue process of severe patients, mainly Western medicine, TCM as a supplement, but sometimes also play a key role, there have been many examples.
医疗队里的中医西医不分你我，谁有办法谁上，能够挽救病人的生命，这才是我们共同的目的。
Medical team of traditional Chinese medicine do not distinguish between you and me, who has the means who can save the lives of patients, this is our common goal.
在疫情如此严重的时候，往往是局外人还在争论中西医到底谁强谁弱，谁优谁劣，既无聊又无意义。
At a time when the epidemic is so severe, it is often outsiders who debate who is strong and weak, who is good and who is poor, boring and pointless.
中医西医各有长处，优势互补，人命大于天，能救命才是最重要的。
Traditional Chinese medicine has its own advantages, complementary advantages, more human life than the day, can save the most important.
江夏方舱医院整体救治情况如何？张伯礼：截至目前，江夏方舱医院累计收治了五百多位患者，主要是以轻症为主，占七八成吧。
How about the overall treatment of Jiangxia Fang Cathedral Hospital? So far, Jiangxi Fangchai Hospital has admitted more than 500 patients, mainly to light cases, accounting for seven or eight percent.
其中，已经出院二百多位患者了。
Of these, more than 200 patients have been discharged.
还有一百多位患者最近陆续也要出院了。
More than a hundred patients have recently been discharged from the hospital.
最让人欣慰的是，江夏方舱医院目前收治的所有患者中，没有一个转为重症的，医护人员也是零感染。
The most comforting thing is that none of the patients admitted to Jiang Xia Fangcao Hospital has turned serious, and there is no infection among the medical staff.
现在，被感染医护人员的救治情况如何？张伯礼：医护人员被感染，大部分是发生在一月份。
Now, what is the treatment status of the infected paramedics? Chamberlain: Most of the infections occurred in January.
当时病人高度集中，秩序混乱，医护人员满负荷、高强度工作，防护物资也不够。
There was a high concentration of patients, disorder, a full load of medical staff, high-intensity work, and inadequate protective materials.
现在防护措施、物资都跟上了，一线医护人员的工作负荷也减轻了，被感染的情况就很少了。
Now that protective measures and supplies are in place and the workload of front-line health-care workers has been reduced, infections are rare.
目前，被感染的医护人员大部分已经治愈出院，还有一部分仍在救治。
At present, most of the infected health care workers have been cured, and some are still being treated.
我们还将为被感染的医务人员建立一个健康管理平台，在未来一到两年，追踪他们的健康状态，以中西医结合的干预方式，帮助他们更好康复。
We will also set up a health management platform for infected medical personnel to track their health over the next year or two and help them recover better through a combination of Chinese and Western medicine interventions.
我们希望能为被感染的医护人员提供必要的帮助，以回报他们的付出和牺牲。
We hope to be able to provide infected health care workers with the necessary help in return for their efforts and sacrifices.
新冠病毒会不会常态化，变成慢性病？张伯礼：新冠病毒到底会不会常态化，目前还不好说，需要继续加强流调和基础研究，毕竟目前我们对它的了解有限。
Will the new canopy virus become a chronic disease? Chamberlain: Whether the new canopy virus will become normal or not, it is not clear that we need to continue to strengthen the flow reconciliation basic research, after all, we have limited knowledge of it at present.
但是，冠状病毒对于人类社会的影响绝不会就此终止。
But the coronavirus's impact on human society will never end.
自上世纪六十年代发现它以来，大多数时间都比较温和，但近二十年它几次变异都形成了大规模疫情，损失巨大。
It has been milder most of the time since it was discovered in the 1960s, but several of its variants in the last two decades have resulted in large-scale outbreaks and huge losses.
所以，我主张要持续研究冠状病毒感染的机制，研发广谱抗冠状病毒的药，以不变应万变。
Therefore, I advocate to continue to study the mechanism of coronavirus infection, to develop a broad spectrum of drugs against coronavirus, to remain unchanged.
现在我们也正在抓紧时间做这件事。
Now we are working hard to do it.
跟SARS相比，新冠肺炎的治疗难度在哪里？张伯礼：跟SARS相比，新冠病毒更“狡猾”、更“多变”、也更让人“猜不透”。
What are the difficulties in treating new crown pneumonia compared to SARS? Zhang: Compared to SARS, the new crown virus is more cunning, more variable and more elusive.
发病初期，病情看上去并不是很重，但是到了一定阶段，就会急转直下。
At the beginning of the illness, it does not seem to be very serious, but at a certain stage, it will go down sharply.
新冠病毒传播性比SARS更强，发病人数、死亡人数也比SARS多得多。
The new crown virus is more transmissible than SARS, and the number of cases and deaths is much higher than SARS.
而且，患者治愈后会出现“反复”，有一定比例的患者出院以后又“复阳”了。
In addition, patients will be cured after the "repeated", a certain proportion of patients discharged from hospital and "Fuyang".
重症患者康复问题也较SARS复杂。
The rehabilitation of critically ill patients is also more complex than SARS.
但我们还是要有信心，毕竟出院后“复阳”的患者是少数。
But we still have to be confident, after all, discharged from the hospital "Fuyang" patients are a minority.
而且，“复阳”患者的治疗也相对容易，基本治疗几天后就会“转阴”。
Moreover, the "Fuyang" patient's treatment is also relatively easy, the basic treatment after a few days will "turn cloudy."
康复也将是今后研究的重点问题。
Rehabilitation will also be a focus of future research.
这次疫情，我们应该吸取哪些教训？张伯礼：首先，要强化源头治理。
What lessons should we learn from this epidemic? First of all, we should strengthen source control.
要杜绝一切野生动物的市场交易，严禁食用陆生的野生动物。
All wildlife market transactions must be stopped and the consumption of terrestrial wildlife strictly prohibited.
这次疫情教训太深刻了，我们一定吸取教训，不能像当初SARS一样，转头就忘了。
The lesson of this epidemic is too profound, we must learn lessons, can not be like SARS at the beginning, turn head forgotten.
其次，现有《中华人民共和国传染病防治法》也需修订。
Secondly, the existing Law of the PRC on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases needs revision.
这次疫情暴露出一个很大的问题，疫情出现了，谁来报？报给谁？现在机制不顺，层层上报、层层审核、层层淡化，到中央都衰减变味儿了，影响中央决策。
The outbreak has revealed a major problem, the outbreak has emerged, who will report? To whom? Now the mechanism is not smooth, layers of reports, layers of review, layers of desalination, to the central all attenuate the flavor, affect the central decision-making.
回过头来看，新冠肺炎在去年12月底、1月初人传人的现象已经很明显了。
In retrospect, the human-to-human transmission of New Crown Pneumonia became apparent in late December and early January.
那时还说是“有限人传人”、“局势可控”，就有问题了，丧失了防控最佳时机。
At that time also said that "limited person-to-person", "situation under control," there is a problem, lost the best time to prevent and control.
再就是，基层社区的卫生能力明显不足。
Furthermore, the health capacity of grass-roots communities is clearly inadequate.
那么多人，一发热就往大医院跑，如果社区的医疗卫生设施足够强，发挥“拦阻干预”作用，疫情可能会在早期得到有效控制，强基层要真正落地。
So many people, rushing to big hospitals as soon as the fever, if the community health facilities are strong enough to play a "stop intervention" role, the epidemic may be effective in the early control of the epidemic, strong grass-roots to the ground.
另外，检测权限集中、试剂盒短缺严重影响了确诊救治，防控物资明显短缺、调配机制滞后、应急系统响应及运营都需要极大改善。
In addition, the concentration of detection authority and the shortage of kits seriously affect the diagnosis and treatment, the obvious shortage of prevention and control materials, the lag of the deployment mechanism, emergency response system and operation all need to be greatly improved.
最后，我想提醒的是，疫情过后也别遗忘了中医药，还是要继续推进中医药事业的发展。
Finally, I would like to remind you not to forget about Chinese medicine after the epidemic, or to continue to promote the development of Chinese medicine.
在近日中国-世卫组织的疫情考察专家组中没有中医药专家，疫情报告中，中医药几乎没有涉及，这令人十分遗憾。
It is regrettable that there are no Chinese medicine experts on the recent China-WHO disease surveillance group, and that Chinese medicine is hardly mentioned in the epidemic report.
