新冠病毒疫情蔓延对已在海外就读的中国留学生造成影响，准备今年申请出国留学的中国学生也面临考试计划调整，即使通过考试并申请到入学机会，他们能否在今年夏天顺利入境澳大利亚等目的国，目前也充满变数文 |《财经》记者 王晓枫编辑 | 郝洲2020年春节期间，新型冠状病毒疫情蔓延，让一些回国过年的中国留学生措手不及，因为部分国家对过去一段时间有过中国旅行经历、特别是去过湖北武汉的人实施限制入境的临时管制，澳大利亚、美国等留学目的地正成为中国学生的两难选择。
With the spread of the new crown virus affecting Chinese students already studying overseas, Chinese students preparing to apply to study abroad face a change in test plans. Even after passing the exam and applying for admission this summer, China's new coronavirus epidemic caught some Chinese students returning home for the Spring Festival 2020.
春节后中国学生返澳上课受限澳大利亚位于南半球，每年中国春节恰逢暑假，大多数中国学生都会选择回国过年，然后在2月中旬回到澳大利亚。
Most Chinese students choose to return home for the Chinese New Year and then return to Australia in mid-February, coinciding with the Chinese New Year holiday.
今年春节，这一惯例被突如其来的疫情打断了。
This custom was interrupted this Spring Festival by a sudden epidemic.
北京时间2月1日，澳大利亚总理莫里森在新闻发布会上表示，即日起澳大利亚将禁止所有在2月1日以后从中国飞抵澳洲的民众入境，但澳大利亚公民、永久居民以及两者的直系亲属和机组人员除外。
Australia will ban all people arriving in Australia from China after February 1, with the exception of Australian citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family and crew, Australian Prime Minister David Morrison said at a press conference.
已经进入澳大利亚的中国人要进行14天自我隔离。
Chinese who have already entered Australia will have 14 days of self-imposed isolation.
在莫里森宣布这一决定的当天，澳大利亚航空（Qantas）也表示将在2月9日至3月29日期间停飞北京和上海往返澳大利亚的航班。
Mr Morrison's announcement came on the day that Qantas said it would suspend flights to and from Beijing and Shanghai between February 9 and March 29.
据悉，这一旅行禁令有效期暂定为两周，两周后再做评估。
The travel ban is tentatively set at two weeks, with an assessment to be made in two weeks.
对此，很多回中国过年的中国留学生颇为担忧，因为大学开学日期是二月中下旬，若错过两周就不可以注册，就要推迟到下学期，一些特殊的科目例如建筑系，则要推迟到下个学年。
Many Chinese students returning to China for the Chinese New Year are worried because college starts in the second half of February and cannot register if they miss two weeks. Some special subjects, such as architecture, will be put off until next academic year.
对那些已经毕业、暂时回家过春节的中国留学生来说，他们准备回澳洲办理工作签证的计划将受到影响，并很有可能导致他们没有办法申请到在澳洲的工作。
For Chinese students who have already graduated and are temporarily returning home for the Spring Festival, their plans to return to Australia for work visas will be affected, and it is likely that they will not be able to apply for jobs in Australia.
澳大利亚上述入境限制令近期在中国留学生中引起强烈反响，一些学生原计划在元宵节后回到澳洲的学校，但澳方新的决定和航空公司取消最近的航班，让他们改签机票的机会都没有，一些人对上述决定颇为抱怨。
Some complained about the recent backlash among Chinese students, some of whom had planned to return to their Australian counterparts after the Lantern Festival, but new Australian decisions and the cancellation of recent flights by airlines had denied them the opportunity to change their airline tickets.
澳洲留学生的微信群里充满了焦虑情绪1月31日，世界卫生组织将中国爆发的新型冠状病毒疫情认定为“国际关注的突发公共卫生事件（PHEIC）”，但该组织总干事同时也强调，不赞成甚至反对其他国家因此对中国采取旅行或贸易禁令。
CHINA'S new coronavirus outbreak was identified as a "public health emergency of international concern" by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on Monday, but the director-general of the organisation stressed that he was "not in favor of or even opposed to the travel ban imposed on China by other countries.
然而，出于对疫情扩散的担忧，美国、澳大利亚、新加坡、俄罗斯等国家近期相继对中国旅客收紧入境措施，实施暂时旅行禁令。
However, fearing the spread of the epidemic, the United States, Australia, Singapore and Russia have recently tightened immigration measures and imposed temporary travel bans on Chinese tourists.
在澳大利亚主要城市的入境关口，莫里森的禁令下达后，一些当天到达澳大利亚的中国学生被拒绝入境，并被安排离境。
Some Chinese students who arrived in Australia that day were refused entry and arranged to leave the country following Morrison's ban at the entry point to Australia's major cities.
在澳洲留学的王文森告诉《财经》记者，他的一位同学是2月1日的航班返澳，但在到达澳大利亚机场后被禁止入境，其后被安排乘机返回中国。
Wang Wensen, who studied in Australia, told Caijing that one of his classmates had returned from a flight on February 1 but was barred from entering Australia after arriving at the Australian airport before being flown back to China.
也有中国留学生从第三方转机而曲折入境澳大利亚，比如即将前往新南威尔士大学就读商务分析研究生的李爱思告诉《财经》记者，她一位朋友2月1日从韩国转机前往澳大利亚，顺利入境。
There have also been Chinese students who have made the detour from third-party connections to Australia. For example, Li Aisi, a graduate student in business analysis at the University of New South Wales, told Caijing that a friend left South Korea for Australia on February 1.
来自山西太原的李爱思自己却没这么幸运，她是澳大利亚一所大学2020年“秋季学期”的新生（南半球秋季从2月份开始）。
Li Aisi from Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, is not so lucky herself, she is an Australian university 2020 "autumn semester" freshman (southern hemisphere autumn starts in February).
这几天她和妈妈都在担忧，她们抵达澳大利亚后会不会被强制停课隔离。
She and her mother have been worried these days about whether they will be forced to suspend classes in Australia.
她们原计划在2月10日乘坐海航航班前往澳大利亚，但莫里森宣布禁令后不久，她们就收到了航班取消的消息。
They had planned to travel to Australia by sea on 10 February, but shortly after Morrison announced the ban, they received news of the flight cancellations.
李爱思在一个有150多人的留学群中，一半左右回国过了春节，现在都开始为如何返回澳大利亚上学而焦虑。
In a group of more than 150 people abroad, about half returned home for the Spring Festival and are now anxious about how to go back to Australia to study.
在悉尼大学读法学专业硕士的鲁彬，目前在湖南长沙家中等待学校更新信息。
Lubin, a LL.M. student at the University of Sydney, is waiting at his home in Changsha, Hunan, for updated information.
她的同学曾试图在香港转机前往澳大利亚，但不被允许登机。
Her classmates tried to transit Hong Kong for Australia but were not allowed to board the plane.
“我们大学这个专业有100多个中国学生，他们中80%回家过年，现在都回不去了”，鲁彬告诉《财经》记者。
"Our university has more than 100 Chinese students, and 80 percent of them go home for the New Year and can't go back," Rubin told Caijing.
无法回到澳大利亚继续读书，将给留学生带来不菲经济损失。
Unable to return to Australia to continue studying will bring significant economic losses to international students.
家住河南郑州的张薇薇是墨尔本大学国际新闻专业研究生，她原计划2月27日回到澳大利亚，她认识的同学90%春节期间回到了中国。
Zhang Weiwei, a graduate student in international journalism from Zhengzhou, Henan, who had planned to return to Australia on February 27, returned to China during 90% of the Spring Festival holiday for students she knew.
目前因为政策变化，张薇薇对《财经》记者说，她很犹豫是否应该在2月14日截止日期前缴付即将开始的“秋季学期”学费，如果不缴费，将耽误一整个学期。
Now, with policy changes, Ms. Zhang told Caijing she was hesitant to pay her upcoming fall semester fees by the Feb. 14 deadline -- failing which she would miss a full semester.
中国留学生中很多人预付了房租，如果不回去，房租也要打水漂。
Many Chinese students pay rent in advance, and if they don't, the rent will go down the drain.
这些中国留学生们都在等待澳大利亚的大学出台应对政策，澳大利亚内政部也建议学生们联系学校获取延期，如有必要，政府也会和学校沟通进行网上教学。
The Chinese students are awaiting policy responses from Australian universities, and the Home Office is advising students to contact schools for extensions and, if necessary, to communicate with schools for online instruction.
中国留学生们认为，这些建议治标不治本，如果整个学期接受网络教学，这将失去留学的意义。
Chinese students believe that these proposals are palliative and will lose the significance of studying abroad if they take an online course throughout the semester.
据了解，澳大利亚一些大学已经出台措施，试图减少入境限制新政策对中国留学生的影响。
It is understood that some Australian universities have introduced measures to try to reduce the impact of the new entry restrictions on Chinese students.
新南威尔士大学在给学生们的邮件中表示，中国学生可以推迟注册，即最晚在2月28日前注册，前两周会对学生们进行网络教学支持，晚注册的中国学生在“秋季学期”只能选两门课而不是三门，因为推迟入学对教学安排会造成影响。
In an e-mail to students, the University of New South Wales said that Chinese students could postpone registration until February 28 at the latest, that they would receive online teaching support for the first two weeks, and that late-enrolled Chinese students could take only two courses instead of three during the fall semester because of the impact on teaching arrangements.
悉尼大学校长也发信安慰中国留学生，称学校正研究如何在校外继续学业，期待中国学生早日返校。
The president of the University of Sydney also wrote to comfort Chinese students, saying the school was looking at how to continue their studies outside the school and expected Chinese students to return to school soon.
留学海外者需要考虑更多变数澳大利亚是中国学生重要留学目的地国家。
Australia is an important destination for Chinese students studying abroad.
澳大利亚官方数据显示：2018年，选择去澳大利亚留学的中国学生人数创记录，从2017年的14.7万人增长到17.3万人，同比增17%，居澳大利亚外国留学生数量之首。
The number of Chinese students choosing to study in Australia rose to a record 173,000 in 2018 from 147,000 in 2017, the highest number of foreign students in Australia, up 17 per cent year on year, according to official Australian figures.
另一项数据显示，澳大利亚外国留学生中，超过37%来自中国。
Another figure shows that more than 37 per cent of foreign students in Australia come from China.
澳大利亚独立研究中心曾对该国7所大学进行分析，这些大学的收入增长严重依赖中国留学生。
The Australian Centre for Independent Studies analysed seven universities in the country, which are heavily dependent on Chinese students for income growth.
一旦中国赴澳留学生数量下降，这些学校将陷入财政困境。
If the number of Chinese students to Australia falls, these schools will be in financial straits.
据了解，一些中国留学生在网上发起签名请愿，希望促使澳大利亚政府允许他们早日入境学习。
It is understood that some Chinese students on the Internet launched a petition, hoping to get the Australian Government to allow them to enter early study.
他们说，中国是澳大利亚教育产业最大海外市场，若因无法入境导致耽搁学业，势必影响中国学生选择澳大利亚作为留学目的地的信心。
'China is the biggest overseas market for Australia's education industry, 'they said.' Failure to enter the country could delay schooling and undermine the confidence of Chinese students in choosing Australia as a destination.
《财经》记者询问澳大利亚驻华使馆，澳方是否会延长旅行禁令？使馆工作人员表示，这一问题将由堪培拉方面回复。
Caijing asked the Australian embassy in Beijing if it would extend the travel ban, saying the issue would be answered by Canberra.
截至目前，澳大利亚外交部和教育部均未对《财经》记者的问题作出正面回应。
So far, neither the Foreign Office nor the Education Department has responded positively to Caijing's questions.
相比澳大利亚，在美国留学的中国学生受到的影响较小。
Chinese students studying in the US are less affected than those in Australia.
因为美国的学校大都在1月份已经开学。
Because most schools in the United States begin classes in January.
也有一些学生因春节回中国过年而遇到麻烦。
Some students also have trouble coming back to China for the Spring Festival.
在纽约大学就读的李澜春节前回国，看到疫情考蔓延，她担心边境管控，1月26日就提前返回美国。
Li Lan, a student at New York University, returned to the United States early on January 26, fearing border controls as the epidemic spread.
“美国发布政策后机票价格飞涨，我的一位同学因为要抢在禁令生效前回到美国，不惜转机多次才有惊无险进入美国。
"Ticket prices skyrocketed after the policy was announced, and one of my classmates had to fly back to America before the ban came into effect.
” 李澜对《财经》记者说。
"Li Lan told Caijing.
目前疫情在美国蔓延范围有限，但李澜在纽约长岛居住的一所公寓有很多中国留学生，大家出入都佩戴口罩，因为不确定谁来自疫区城市，是否会传染。
The spread of the epidemic is limited in the United States, but Li Lan lives on Long Island in New York City, a large number of Chinese students, wearing masks in and out of the city, because it is not sure who is from the affected city and whether it will spread.
李澜所居住的公寓微信群中曾传出，有学生家长从武汉来此居住，这让很多人一度紧张。
Li Lan lived in a small group of apartment had been reported, there are students from Wuhan parents to live here, which made many people nervous for a while.
根据美国方面的消息，亚利桑那州立大学坦佩校园（ASU）一位最近到访武汉的人员，被确诊为新冠肺炎并接受隔离治疗，该校的一些留学生也向《财经》记者确认了这一消息。
A recent visit to Wuhan by an ASU student at Arizona State University was diagnosed with New Crown Pneumonia and treated in isolation, according to US sources, and some students at the school confirmed the news to Caijing.
这在亚利桑那州立大学引起一定的恐慌，有些在校学生要求学校暂时停课。
This has caused some panic at Arizona State University, where some students are asking schools to suspend classes.
《财经》记者了解到，该校有教授让学生暂时放假。
Caijing reporter learned that the school has professors to let students have a temporary holiday.
鉴于美国政府要求来自中国武汉的旅客进行自我隔离，一位1月9日从武汉返回ASU的中国留学生因回来前曾发烧，目前正在自我隔离中，等待确认是否感染新冠肺炎。
A Chinese student who returned to ASU from Wuhan on January 9 has a fever and is now in self-imposed isolation, awaiting confirmation of new crown pneumonia.
疫情蔓延及引起的连锁反应，也开始影响今年申请出国留学的中国学生考试计划。
The spread of the epidemic and the chain reaction it has caused are also beginning to affect the examination plans of Chinese students applying to study abroad this year.
美国教育考试服务中心（ETS）已经发布通知，自即日起在中国大陆地区取消2020年2月所有托福考试和GRE普通考试。
The US Educational Testing Service (ETS) has announced the cancellation of all TOEFL and GRE General Tests in China with immediate effect.
英国雅思官方微博也发布通知，在中国大陆取消2020年1月31日和2月所有各类雅思考试。
The official Weibo service also announced the cancellation of all kinds of IELTS tests on January 31 and February 2020 in mainland China.
上述考试变动通告发出后，很多出国英语教学平台纷纷发布消息，帮助学生应对变化。
After the announcement of these changes, many English teaching platforms abroad released messages to help students cope with the changes.
一些留学生担忧3月乃至4月的出国留学英文考试是否也会取消，对于这种可能性，一家知名线上英语教学平台从业人士对《财经》记者表示，ETS应该会酌情考量，因为取消太多场考试，会对今年剩余时间内的考场安排带来压力，并将影响部分中国学生今年底的大学申请。
Some students worry about the possibility of cancelling English-language exams in March or April, a leading online English-teaching platform executive told Caijing. ETS should think twice, because cancelling too many tests will put pressure on the test schedule for the rest of the year and will affect some Chinese students' college applications later this year.
据《财经》了解，一些需要出境考试的科目，因为新加坡等邻国暂时限制中国居民入境，在这些国家安排的2月、3月相关科目考试，均已通知学生更换考试地点。
According to Caijing, students have been told to change the test venue for the February and March exams in some of the subjects for which exit tests are required because neighbouring countries such as Singapore temporarily restrict the entry of Chinese residents.
暂未完全限制中国居民入境的柬埔寨和泰国等地，成为中国学生3月境外考试的新选择。
places such as Cambodia and Thailand, which have not completely restricted the entry of Chinese residents, have become new options for overseas examinations for Chinese students in March.
至于这些更换会否还有变数，取决于接下来的疫情防控进展。
Whether these changes will be variable will depend on the next progress in the prevention and control of the epidemic.
