编者按：上海市第一人民医院呼吸科的谢国钢医生，2月1日报名了支援上海公共卫生临床中心医疗队。
Editor's Note: Dr. Xie Guogang of the respiratory department of Shanghai First People's Hospital signed up on February 1 to support the medical team of Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center.
清晨5点，值班的他接到了报到的电话通知，连家都来不及回，就匆匆奔赴了“战场”。
At 5 a. m. he got a call to report for duty, even his family did not have time to return, rushed to the "battlefield."
要知道，谢国钢医生12月份才刚刚结束为期半年的援滇工作，如今又踏上了新的征程，而且更为艰辛和危险。
You know, Xie Guogang just finished half a year's work in Yunnan in December, and now he has embarked on a new journey, which is even more arduous and dangerous.
还记得年前跟谢医生聊天，问他是不是又没得休假了。
Remember talking to Dr. Xie years ago and asking him if he didn't get a vacation again.
他回答我：随时ON CALL。
He replied, "On the go, ON CALL.
言语形容不出我当下的感受，但作为一个普通市民，有这样的医生守护我们的健康，安全感满满。
Words cannot describe my current feelings, but as an ordinary citizen, we have such a doctor to protect our health, a full sense of security.
撰文| 谢国钢得知医院要组建支援上海公共卫生临床中心医疗队的消息后，我第一时间报了名。
When Xie learned that the hospital wanted to set up a medical team to support the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, I immediately signed up.
专业对口，又是共产党员，在当前这种形势下，无需动员，迎着危险必须得上。
Professional counterpart, is a Communist, in the current situation, do not need to mobilize to meet the danger must be.
只是没想到，开赴战场的命令来得如此之快，在医院值24小时班清晨五点多接到了医务处紧急电话，通知我当天上午出发去上海公共卫生临床中心报到，一派不见硝烟的战场气氛。
I just didn't know that the order to go to the battlefield had come so fast that I received an emergency call from the medical service at more than 5 a.m. on the 24-hour flight to Shanghai Public Health Clinic.
回家准备是来不及了，让家里赶紧收拾一些日常用品送到了医院。
It was too late to get home, so the family hurried to pack some daily supplies to the hospital.
我们这批医疗队包括一位医生和两位护士，医院领导举行了简短的欢送和慰问仪式，张旻主任再三叮嘱我既要做好防护，同时用自己良好的专业能力尽心做好患者的诊治和心理疏导。
Our medical team including a doctor and two nurses, hospital leaders held a brief farewell and condolences ceremony, director Min Min repeatedly told me to do a good job of protection, but also with their good professional capacity to do a good job of patient diagnosis and psychological counseling.
随后，我们便踏上了征程。
Then we set out on a journey.
有朋友问我怕不怕。
Some friends asked me to be afraid.
这个真没有。
That's not true.
恐惧源于未知，信心来自通晓。
Fear always springs from the unknown and faith from familiarity.
既然知道了病毒的传染性，只要思想重视、认真做好防护，就无感染之虞。
Now that you know the infectious nature of the virus, as long as the idea of attention, careful protection, there is no risk of infection.
还有朋友说我要去受苦了，这个真不算啥，想想我们学科带头人周新教授在除夕之夜就远赴武汉投入抗击新型冠状病毒肺炎的斗争，身先士卒、不辞辛劳。
It is nothing to think that my friend said I was going to suffer. Professor Zhou Xin, our academic leader, went to Wuhan on New Year's Eve to take part in the fight against the new coronavirus pneumonia.
在如此榜样面前，我们就不觉得辛苦了。
In the face of such an example, we do not feel laborious.
来到上海市公共卫生临床中心，我们迅速和其他医院来支援的医疗队汇合。
Coming to Shanghai Public Health Clinic, we quickly joined up with other hospital-assisted medical teams.
公卫的领导特别强调了医护人员的自身防护与救治病人同样重要，如果医务人员不能做到零感染，那我们抗击新冠肺炎的战役将来就不能说取得完全的胜利。
Public-health leaders stress that self-protection for health-care workers is as important as treating patients, and that our battle against pneumonia will not be a complete victory in the future if medical staff fail to achieve zero infection.
这番话振聋发聩，也对我们提出了非常高的要求。
This statement has been a source of great alarm and has placed very high demands on us.
接下来的重头戏顺理成章就是培训隔离服的穿脱流程。
The next big thing to do is to train the wearing off-the-rack process.
在传染病的防治过程中，隔离衣是最有效的防护措施，既保护医护人员自己，又防止病原微生物的播散，避免了交叉感染，因此，熟练掌握隔离衣穿脱过程的每一个步骤和细节是极其重要的。
In the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, isolation clothing is the most effective protective measure, not only to protect the health-care personnel themselves, but also to prevent the spread of pathogenic microorganisms, to avoid cross-infection, so it is extremely important to master every step and detail of the isolation process.
第一次穿戴隔离衣难免手忙脚乱，公卫感染科的老师既严格又耐心，监督我们每个人反复练习，逐个过关才放行。
For the first time, the first wearing of the isolation clothing, the Department of Public Health infection teachers are strict and patient, monitoring each of us repeated practice, clearance clearance.
培训和练习整整花了一下午的时间，不过这是非常值得的，准备越充分，我们被感染的机会就越小。
The training and practice took an entire afternoon, but it was well worth it, and the better prepared we were, the less likely we were to get infected.
在我们自己的咽拭子采样结果确认阴性后，我们连夜进入了病房大楼，开始熟悉病区环境，了解病人收治流程。
After our own swabs tested negative, we walked into the ward overnight, familiarizing ourselves with the environment and patient admission procedures.
进入这栋病房大楼后，我们在接下来的两周内再也不能踏足大楼外，所有的工作和生活均为封闭式管理，当然，电话和消息是畅通无阻的，时刻能与外界保持联系。
After entering the ward building, we would not be able to step outside the building for the next two weeks. All work and life would be closed, of course, the telephone and the news would be unobstructed and we would be able to keep in touch with the outside world.
第二天，我们正式踏上工作岗位，开始投入紧张的战斗。
The next day, we formally set foot on the job and began to engage in intense fighting.
我所在的A1病房大楼则主要收治轻症患者，卫健委联合专家组每天会对收治的患者进行集体视频查房，而我这里的任务主要就是日常病区查房，把病人的病情变化情况提供给专家组，及时发现重症患者给予更积极的救治。
Ward A1, where I work, treats patients with mild illnesses. The joint health team conducts group video check-ups of patients every day, and my job here is to check the patient's condition and provide the panel with timely and more active treatment.
既有大量的文书工作需要完成，又要时刻关注自己管理的病人的检查化验结果和病情变化，工作量还是相当大的。
There is a great deal of paperwork to be done, and a great deal of care must be paid to the examination of patients and changes in their condition.
然而，最耗费精力同时风险最大的还是进入隔离病房近距离接触患者。
However, the most energy-intensive and riskiest was access to the isolation ward for close contact with patients.
新病人来了，采集病史可以通过与患者电话完成，但了解病人情况还是必须进入病房面对面完成。
New patients arrived, the collection history can be done by telephone with the patient, but understand the patient or must enter the ward face-to-face to complete.
每个新病人我们都需要进行体格检查和心电图检查，对患者状况进行评估以决定相应的治疗方案。
For each new patient, we need a physical examination and an electrocardiogram to assess the patient's condition and determine the appropriate treatment options.
面戴N95口罩、身着厚重的隔离衣，在封闭的病房里工作，步履迟缓、感觉呼吸都很费力，时间一长，浑身淌汗，护目镜一片茫然。
Wearing a N95 mask, wearing heavy protective clothing, working in a closed ward, walking slowly, feeling breathless, sweating over a long time, his goggles dazed.
在我的工作经历中，这是最痛苦的工作环境，然而，在这里，你也能遇到患者最期待的眼神。
In my work experience, this is the most painful work environment, however, here, you can also meet the patients most expected eyes.
在我们查房的时候，有拉住你说“医生，你要多来看看我！”的患者，你需要给予温和的宽慰；有烦躁地质问“医生，我的病怎么还没好转？”的患者，你需要给予坚定的鼓励；有的患者因思念家人而潸然泪下，你会心有戚戚；有的患者病情好转，你会与其共享喜悦。
While we're checking out the room, you need a gentle relief from someone who says, "Doctor, you want to see me more!"; someone who is upset and asks, "Doctor, why is my illness not getting better?" You need firm encouragement.
虽然他们看不到我的脸，但在交流中，这冰冷的防护服似乎也有了温度，虽然它笨重、闷热，却有无数的医护人员甘愿着衣、负重工作。
Though they couldn't see my face, the icy protective clothing seemed to have a temperature in communication, too, and though it was heavy and sultry, countless medical workers were willing to wear clothes and carry heavy loads.
穿上这防护服，我们的医护人员是忍者，更是仁者。
Put on this protective clothing, our medical personnel are ninja, more benevolent.
习总书记说“越是艰难越向前”，扶危渡厄，乃是医者担当。
General Secretary Xi said that "the more difficult the more forward," the help of danger and perdition, is the role of the healer.
