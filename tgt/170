The Shanghai Institute of Medicine of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (hereinafter referred to as Shanghai Medicines Institute) has been caught in a public uproar as a result of the initial discovery that the Chinese patent medicine Shuanghuanglian Oral Liquid can inhibit the new coronavirus.
上海药物所长期从事抗病毒药物研究。
Shanghai Medicines Institute has long been engaged in antiviral research.
2003年非典来袭，《首都医药》杂志等信息发布渠道曾发文称，上海药物研究所研究证实，“洁尔阴洗液具有抗SARS冠状病毒作用”。
When SARS hit in 2003, information distribution channels such as the Capital Medicine magazine wrote that the Shanghai Institute of Medicine confirmed that "the cleansing solution has anti-SARS coronavirus effect."
此次新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情发生后，上海药物所成立了应急攻关团队，公布了30个可能的抗2019-nCoV冠状病毒老药和中药，并与前沿生物药业针对抗2019-nCoV新药开发达成了合作。
Following the outbreak of the new coronavirus-infected pneumonia, the Shanghai Drug Administration set up an emergency response team, published 30 possible anti-2019-nCoV coronavirus coronavirus drugs and traditional Chinese medicines, and entered into a partnership with the Frontier Biopharmaceutical Industry for the development of new anti-2019-nCoV drugs.
2月1日，中央指导小组医疗小组专家、中国工程院院士张伯礼在接受央视新闻采访时表示，双黄连口服液只能起到调节体内状态的作用，对(新型冠状)病毒并不具有针对性。
On February 1, experts from the Central Steering Group's medical team and member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, Zhang Boli, told CCTV that the oral liquid can only regulate internal state, and is not targeted at the (new coronary) virus.
当晚，中科院上海药物研究所在官网发表声明称，由中科院上海药物所、武汉病毒所1月31日向媒体提供的《上海药物所、武汉病毒所联合发现中成药双黄连口服液可抑制新型冠状病毒》一文，内容准确无误。
In the evening, the Shanghai Institute of Medicine of the Chinese Academy of Sciences issued a statement on the official website saying that the joint discovery of the Chinese patent medicine Shuanghuanglian Oral Liquid by the Shanghai Medicine Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Wuhan Virus Institute provided to the media on January 31 is accurate.
上海药物研究所新闻发言人表示，“这一结论是基于实验室体外研究的结果。
"This conclusion is based on the results of in vitro laboratory studies," said a spokesman for the Shanghai Institute of Medicine.
研究团队通过实验室体外试验证明，双黄连有抑制新型冠状病毒作用，下一步还需通过进一步临床研究来证实。
The team demonstrated in vitro that Shuanghuanglian can inhibit the new coronavirus. The next step needs to be confirmed by further clinical research.
我所提供的稿件中也提到目前正在开展临床研究”。
There is also a reference in my contribution to the ongoing clinical research. "
曾称“洁尔阴”能抗SARS病毒活性 据官网介绍，中科院上海药物研究所前身是国立北平研究院药物研究所，创建于1932年，次年迁至上海，2003年搬迁至浦东张江高科技园区，是国内历史最悠久的综合性创新药物研究机构。
The Shanghai Institute of Medicine of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, formerly the Institute of Medicine of the National Institute of Peking, was founded in 1932, moved to Shanghai the following year, moved to Pudong Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park in 2003, and is the oldest comprehensive and innovative drug research institute in China.
作为一家长期从事抗病毒药物研究的研究所，在17年前的非典疫情中，上海药物所曾表示“洁尔阴”也具有抗SARS冠状病毒作用。
As a long-term research institute engaged in antiviral drugs, 17 years ago during the SARS epidemic, Shanghai Medicine Institute said that "Eryin" also has anti-SARS coronavirus effect.
《首都医药》杂志2003年第12期《洁尔阴洗液在抗SARS方面的研究成果》一文就提到，“洁尔阴洗液抗击SARS病毒作用，经中国科学院上海药物研究所国家新药筛选中心最新研究证实：其体外在1:100浓度下即具有抗SARS病毒活性”。
"The anti-SARS effects of Jieyin lotion have been confirmed by a recent study by the National New Drug Screening Center of the Shanghai Institute of Medicine of the Chinese Academy of Sciences."
资料显示，《首都医药》是北京市药品监督管理局机关刊物，是北京市药品监督管理、医药卫生工作的指导性刊物。
According to the data, Capital Medicine is the organ publication of the Beijing Municipal Drug Administration and the guiding publication of the supervision and administration of drugs and medical and sanitary work in Beijing.
公开资料显示，“洁尔阴”主治清热燥湿，杀虫止痒。
Open data shows that "Jie Eryin" main treatment of heat desiccation, insecticide antipruritic.
目前，“洁尔阴”洗液的厂商成都恩威集团官网上仍保留着该篇报道。
At present, "Jie Eryin" lotion manufacturer Chengdu Enwei Group officials still keep the article online.
在此次新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情发生后，上海药物所也没缺席，组建了应急攻关团队，利用前期抗SARS药物研究积累的经验，公布了30个可能的抗2019-nCoV冠状病毒老药和中药。
In the wake of the outbreak of the new coronavirus-infected pneumonia, the Shanghai Drug Administration (SAI) has formed an emergency response team to publish 30 possible anti-2019-nCoV coronavirus drugs and traditional Chinese medicines, drawing on the experience gained from previous anti-SARS drug studies.
此外，据前沿生物药业(南京)股份有限公司1月30日消息，该公司与上海药物所针对抗2019-nCoV新药开发达成了项目合作。
In addition, Frontier Biopharmacology (Nanjing) Co., Ltd. has entered into a joint project with Shanghai Medicines Corp. to develop a new anti-2019-nCoV drug, the company said.
根据协议，前沿生物取得抗冠状病毒候选新药DC系列在中国大陆地区临床开发、生产、制造及商业化的独家权利。
According to the agreement, frontline organisms acquire the exclusive rights to clinical development, production, manufacture and commercialization of the new drug DC series against coronavirus in mainland China.
1月31日晚，有媒体报道，中国科学院上海药物所和武汉病毒所联合研究初步发现，中成药双黄连口服液可抑制新型冠状病毒。
On the evening of January 31, a media report said a joint study by the Shanghai Medicine Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Wuhan Virus Institute found that the Chinese patent medicine Shuanghuanglian Oral Liquid could inhibit the new coronavirus.
不过，该发现随后遭到质疑。
However, the finding was subsequently challenged.
2月1日，人民日报官博表示，抑制并不等于预防和治疗，提醒“请勿抢购自行服用双黄连口服液”。
On February 1, the People's Daily official Bo said suppression is not equal to prevention and treatment, reminding "do not rush to buy their own Shuanghuanglian oral liquid."
同日，中央指导小组医疗小组专家、中国工程院院士张伯礼接受央视新闻采访时表示，双黄连口服液就是一种普通的中成药，主要成分是金银花、黄芩、连翘三味中药，这些中成药只能起到调节体内状态的作用，对(新型冠状)病毒并不具有针对性。
On the same day, the Central Steering Group medical team expert, Chinese Academy of Engineering Academician Zhang Boli told CCTV that Shuanghuanglian oral liquid is a common Chinese patent medicine, the main ingredients are honeysuckle, baicalin and Forsythia, which can only play a role in regulating the internal state, not targeted (the new coronary) virus.
上海药物所在接受媒体采访时亦表示，仅做了一个初步验证，对病人是否有效还需要做大量实验。
In an interview with the media, the Shanghai Drug Administration said only a preliminary test had been done and that much remained to be done to determine whether the patient was effective.
除了从事研究工作，上海药物所也对外投资公司。
In addition to its research work, the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Institute is also an outbound investment company.
天眼查数据显示，上海药物所曾先后投资了10家公司，涉及中药制造、医学咨询、保健产品、生物科技等领域。
The company has invested in 10 companies in the fields of traditional Chinese medicine manufacture, medical consultation, health products and biotechnology, according to Tianeye.
目前，多家公司处于已注销的状态，经营状态为存续和在业的公司分别是上海创药投资有限公司和北京华世天富生物医药科技有限公司，上海药物所的投资比例分别为100%和9.4%。
At present, many companies are in the state of write-off. The companies in operation are Shanghai Chuang-Medicine Investment Co. Ltd. and Beijing Tianfu Biomedical Technology Co. Ltd. The proportion of investment in Shanghai Pharmaceutical Company is 100% and 9.4% respectively.
合作企业曾涉嫌发布虚假广告 官网显示，上海药物所一直以来与药企都有开展项目合作。
Co-operative enterprises have been suspected of publishing false advertising official website, the Shanghai Medicines Institute has been working with pharmaceutical companies on projects.
其长期合作伙伴之一的上海绿谷制药有限公司曾饱受质疑。
Shanghai Green Valley Pharmaceuticals, one of its long-time partners, has been widely questioned.
绿谷制药官网显示，绿谷制药成立于1997年，与上海药物研究所关系紧密。
Green Valley Pharma, founded in 1997, is closely linked to the Shanghai Institute of Medicine, according to GreenValley Pharma.
上海药物研究所是绿谷制药长期的核心战略合作伙伴，绿谷制药在上海药物研究所设立了“绿谷创新基金”，用于支持新药研发。
The Shanghai Pharmaceutical Research Institute is a long-term core strategic partner of Green Valley Pharmaceuticals, which has established the Green Valley Innovation Fund at the Shanghai Drug Research Institute to support new drug research and development.
此外，绿谷制药的科学决策委员会包括上海药物所第六任所长(2004年至2013年)丁健和学术委员会副主任耿美玉。
In addition, Green Valley Pharma's scientific decision-making committee includes Ding Jian, the sixth director of the Shanghai Institute of Medicine (2004-2013), and Maggie Meiyu, Deputy Director of the Academic Council.
天眼查显示，目前丁健为绿谷制药的副董事长，耿美玉在2015年4月至2018年9月期间担任绿谷制药的董事。
Ting Jian is currently vice-chairman of Green Valley Pharmaceuticals and served as director of Green Valley Pharmaceuticals from April 2015 to September 2018, according to Tian Yin.
也有证据表明，两者不仅是合作伙伴的关系。
There is also evidence that the relationship is not just one of partnership.
上海药物所官网2015年和2017年刊登的两篇媒体报道指出，绿谷制药是上海药物所与绿谷集团合办的合资制药企业。
Two media reports published by the Shanghai Drug Administration Network in 2015 and 2017 indicate that Greengrain Pharmaceutical is a joint venture between the Shanghai Medicines Institute and the Green Valley Group.
天眼查显示，上海药物研究所在2018年6月20日退出了绿谷制药的投资人行列，目前绿谷制药由绿谷集团100%持股。
The Shanghai Institute of Medicine withdrew from GreenValley Pharma's investor base on June 20, 2018, according to Skyeye, and Green Valley Pharmaceuticals is now owned by 100% of Green Valley Group.
公开资料显示，绿谷集团以售卖保健品发家，由绿谷制药的董事长吕松涛于1997年成立，其一款主打的保健品曾涉嫌违规宣传。
According to public sources, Green Valley Group, founded in 1997 by Lu Songtao, chairman of Green Valley Pharmaceuticals, has been known to sell health products, one of whose main health products has been suspected of infringing the law.
2008年1月，中央电视台曾播出了揭秘“绿谷”骗局的报道。
In January 2008, CCTV aired a story about the "Green Valley" scam.
报道称，从1996年开始，绿谷集团先后推出了三代所谓的抗癌产品，分别是中华灵芝宝、双灵固本散和绿谷灵芝宝。
Since 1996, Green Valley Group has launched three generations of so-called anti-cancer products: Ganoderma sinensis, Shuangling Guben Powder and Ganoderma Ganoderma Ganoderma.
绿谷集团10余年不断变换名称虚假宣传，且在没有审批的情况下擅自发布产品广告，成为彼时近十年来全国最典型的系列虚假广告宣传案之一。
Green Valley Group in more than 10 years constantly changing the name of false propaganda, and without approval of the release of product advertising without approval, then became one of the most typical series of false advertising cases in the country in the past decade.
报道称，经药监部门查实，在绿谷集团一系列的抗癌产品广告中，引用了大量的科研机构、专家学者等对先后三代产品的所谓抗癌效果进行宣传。
In a series of advertisements for anti-cancer products, Green Valley Group has cited a large number of scientific research institutes, experts and scholars to publicize the so-called anti-cancer effects of three generations of products, the report said.
其中在宣传绿谷灵芝宝时，广告中曾提到“中国科学院上海药物研究所通过体外实验证实，绿谷灵芝宝对人体实体瘤和白血病、淋巴瘤细胞具有明显的抑制作用”。
In the promotion of Ganoderma lucidum, the advertisement mentioned that "The Shanghai Institute of Medicine of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has confirmed through in vitro experiments that Ganoderma lucidum has obvious inhibitory effects on human solid tumor, leukemia and lymphoma cells."
被央视曝光的次年，解放日报一篇报道指出，绿谷制药就与上海药物所签订了总金额数千万美元的合同，获得“GV-971”的全球开发许可权，而那时绿谷制药的年销售收入只有1000万元。
The year after the CCTV exposure, a report in the People's Liberation Daily pointed out that Green Valley Pharmaceuticals had signed tens of millions of dollars in contracts with Shanghai Pharmaceuticals to obtain a global development license for GV-971, which had annual sales of just 10 million yuan.
这一研究历经10年，2019年11月初，国家药品监督管理局有条件批准了绿谷制药治疗阿尔茨海默病新药——九期一®(甘露特钠，代号：GV-971)的上市申请，主要发明人是耿美玉团队。
The study took 10 years, and in early November 2019, the State Administration of Medicines conditionally approved the listing application of Green Valley Pharmaceuticals for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease, phase I (Mannose Sodium, code-named GV-971), with the main inventor being the Geng Mei Yu team.
2019年11月29日，一篇署名为“饶毅”写给国家自然科学基金委员会主任李静海的信函流出，指出耿美玉有关药物GV-971的论文涉嫌造假。
On November 29, 2019, a letter signed by Rao Yi addressed to Li Jinghai, director of the National Natural Science Foundation, pointed out that Geng Mei-yu's thesis on the drug GV-971 was suspected of forgery.
随后，饶毅向媒体表示“没有发出，有过草稿”。
Subsequently, Rao Yi told the media that "did not send out, there was a draft."
国家自然科学基金委则向媒体表示，正在调查核实此事。
The National Natural Science Foundation said to the media, is investigating to verify the matter.
