唱K、密室、抓娃娃、剧本杀......都凉了。

The Innovation Economic Plague Program is a special section of the New Pneumonia Epidemic launched by FCI. It focuses on the new difficulties encountered by innovative economic enterprises, discusses new measures to be adopted, and hopes to help SMEs overcome challenges and seize opportunities together.
作者 | 闫丽娇编辑 | 周昶帆刚刚过去的2月15日，密室逃脱店老板老刘和很多老板一样，结完了上个月最后一笔工资，然后裁掉了在家待业的员工。
Yan Lijie, editor and assistant secretary, just last February 15. Like many bosses, the Chamber of Secrets broke away from its owner, Lao Liu, by paying last month's final pay and laying off unemployed employees at home.
“不知道疫情什么时候能结束，实在养不起了，该遣散的都遣散了。
"I don't know when the outbreak will end. It's too late to keep them," he said.
下一步还在观望，如果疫情一两个月内还不结束，3家门店可能也得关掉。
The next step is to wait and see if the epidemic does not end within a month or two, and the three stores may have to be shut down.
”他告诉燃财经。
"he told Flaming Finance.
贾幼斌在河北经营着一家KTV 。
Mr. Jia runs a KTV in Hebei.
春节前，他把2019年一部分利润拿出来发了工资和年终奖，扩招了员工，又提前囤了一大批水果、零食和酒水打算迎接春节旺季。
Before the Spring Festival holiday, he set aside a portion of 2019 profits for wages and year-end bonuses, expanded staff and hoarded a raft of fruit, snacks and drinks in advance for the Spring Festival holiday season.
2月14日，他给员工发了一个半月的工资，只留下了他和另外两个主管。
On 14 February, he paid his employees one and a half months' salary, leaving him and two other supervisors behind.
决定裁员前，已经有一部分员工提前离职。
Before the decision to lay off workers, some had already left early.
疫情刚开始时，他在微信群里承诺了坚决不裁员。
At the beginning of the epidemic, he promised in his microphone group not to lay off workers.
“我也知道他们现在出去不好找工作，他们怨我也没办法，实在撑不下去了。
"I know they can't go out and look for a job right now, and they're complaining that I can't make it.
”裁员前，贾幼斌算了算账上的钱，连下个月的工资都不够。
Before the layoff, Mr. Jia calculated the money on his books, not even next month's salary.
他承认自己低估了疫情的后续影响。
He admitted to underestimating the aftermath of the outbreak.
李梁是一家连锁网咖的店长，他所加盟的网咖品牌在全国有400多家线下店。
Li Liang is the head of a chain of Internet cafes, and his network coffee brand has more than 400 offline stores across the country.
据他了解，进入2月中旬，全国的其他店铺也在相继裁员。
He knew that in the middle of February, other shops across the country were laying off workers.
“很多老板都在裁员，只是大家不敢说，新一波的裁员潮已经悄悄开始。
"A lot of bosses are laying off workers, but it's hard to say that a new wave of layoffs has started quietly."
你也不能怪他们，自己都没钱活下去了，你让他怎么顾及其他人？”近几年，随着线下娱乐消费的繁荣，兴起了不少新业态，比如夹机占（抓娃娃机）、狼人杀、网咖、剧本杀、密室逃脱等等，其中大部分业态在国内刚发展没几年，尚未诞生大的公司和品牌，行业里以中小企业居多。
You can't blame them for not having enough money to live on, so how can you let him care for othersIn recent years, as off-line entertainment consumption has boomed, new industries have sprung up, such as grippers, werewolves, cyber cafes, screenplays, backroom escapes, and so on.
疫情影响下，线下娱乐场所关停，眼下迫切的房租、人力成本带来了现金流压力，这些中小企业是否能活下去成了一个普遍问题。
With off-line entertainment facilities shut down and cash-flow pressures from pressing rents and labor costs, the survival of these small and medium-sized enterprises has become a common issue.
潮玩品牌奥石主理人王裕坤告诉燃财经，受影响的不仅仅是中小企业，还有很多自由工作者。
Zhang Yue Kun, chief executive of the Chaoshi brand, told Flaming Finance that not only small and medium-sized enterprises are affected, but also many freelance workers.
例如演唱会、展会、电竞比赛等被迫取消或延期后，独立玩具设计师们也无法通过玩具展来推出自己的新作品。
Independent toy designers can't launch their new pieces through toy shows after concerts, exhibitions, Atletico competitions, etc., have been canceled or postponed.
线下收入为主要收入来源的文化娱乐类公司，在疫情影响下成为了第一块被推倒的多米诺骨牌，危机从单个公司开始波及整个产业链上下游。
Culture and entertainment companies, whose main source of income is offline, became the first domino to be pushed over by the epidemic, with the crisis spreading down and up the entire industrial chain, starting with individual companies.
除了被现金流压垮之外，线下娱乐还要遭受时间更漫长的影响，比如行业人才流失，以及对行业信心的重振。
In addition to being overwhelmed by cash flow, offline entertainment is subject to longer-term effects, such as brain drain from the industry and a revival of confidence in the industry.
有的人在窃喜，有的人在自救。
Some are stealing, others are saving themselves.
灾难中，很多人没有放弃寻找新出路，文娱是个比较特殊的行业，线下遇冷，线上娱乐却借此迎来转机。
In the disaster, many people have not given up looking for a new outlet, entertainment is a relatively special industry, online entertainment is a turning point.
但是，相比餐饮、旅游这些刚需行业，非刚需的文创行业恢复起来也会更加滞后。
However, compared to catering, tourism and other just-needed industries, the non-just-needed creative industries will be more backward.
可以说，这场疫情的长期影响将会逐渐显现。
Arguably, the long-term effects of the epidemic will be felt.
现金流重压下的小企业和个体从业者2018年正值密室逃脱在国内风靡之际，40岁的老刘在昌平开了第一家密室逃脱店。
Small businesses and self-employed workers under the weight of cash flow opened the first back-room escape shop in Changping in 2018, just as the Chamber of Secrets was fleeing the country.
生意好的时候，一周能有80多人进店，全年无休。
When business is good, more than 80 people a week can enter the store, all year round.
因为生意不错，紧接着，他又在2019年连开了三家店。
After doing well, he opened three more stores in 2019.
四家店前期总共投入了160多万。
Four stores invested more than 1.6 million dollars in the first phase.
“密室逃脱相比其他线下店成本高在装修上，得请专业施工队设计密室。
"Chamber of Secrets escape than other online shop costs high in decoration, professional construction team had to design the Chamber.
”老刘每家店每年租金成本大约15-20万，单店需要10-12个月才能回本。
"The annual rental cost for each store is about 150,000 to 200,000, and it takes 10 to 12 months for a single shop to return.
老刘说，疫情的发生，让他这两年的利润都打了水漂。
'With the outbreak of the epidemic, his profits have been wasted for two years, 'Mr. Liu said.
马上临近新一年的续租期，如果疫情在4月前还不结束，他会选择关掉其他三家店，只留下一家。
As we approach the renewal of the lease for the next year, if the epidemic does not end before April, he will choose to close down the other three and leave only one.
2003年非典让他印象深刻，他记得，虽然非典在上半年就已经结束，但疫情过后的恐慌一直持续到了下半年。
He was impressed by SARS in 2003 and recalled that although SARS had ended in the first half of the year, the post-epidemic panic continued into the second half of the year.
“疫情结束后，大家敢不敢马上出来玩也是个问题。
"It is also a problem when the epidemic is over that people dare not come out right away.
尤其对我们这种，需要一堆人聚在一起，还要在密闭空间里完成的娱乐项目。
Especially for our kind of entertainment projects that require a bunch of people to get together and complete in a confined space.
”这意味着，即便结束了疫情，至少有几个月时间，他的生意还会继续受影响。
That means his business will continue to suffer for at least a few months, even after the outbreak is over.
“我预估，从现在开始至少还有2个月不能正常营业，我有不到10个员工，假如每人每月的工资按5000算，也是一笔不小的开销。
"I estimate that there will be at least two months from now and I don't have 10 employees, and if each person gets 5,000 a month, that's a lot of money," he said
还没有把其他费用算进来。
Other costs have not been factored in.
”老刘无奈地说。
"said Liu helplessly.
除了及时止损，他也没有其他措施。
He had nothing else to do but stop the damage in time.
“身边朋友开一家店的还能坚持坚持，我有4家店，压力是他们的4倍。
"Friends open a shop around can also insist on, I have four stores, the pressure is four times their.
”易码密室逃脱创始人张易波接受采访时表示，往年春节期间是玩家集中的高峰期，从元旦开始，在大年初一至初七这几天达到高峰，每天的流水可以是淡季的2-3倍，很多新店也会集中在年前开业，回笼一波资金。
In previous years, the Spring Festival is the peak period for players to concentrate on, starting on New Year's Day and peaking in the first to seventh days of the New Year, said Zhang Yibo, founder of the Barcode Chamber of Secrets, in an interview.
老店靠着积累的粉丝和现金流扛2-3个月可能没问题，最困难的是刚开业的门店。
Old stores may be fine for 2-3 months with built-up fans and cash flow, but the hardest part is just-opened stores.
前期投入了几十万、上百万，疫情发生后让他们措手不及。
The early investment of hundreds of thousands, millions of people, after the outbreak caught them off guard.
作为最近几年才在国内兴起的娱乐方式，狼人杀、密室逃脱、剧本杀等全国新成立的品牌，绝大多数都是中小企业、小微企业，第一次面对这样的突发公共事件，它们并没有什么抗风险的准备。
Werewolves, back-room escapes and screenplays, the vast majority of which are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and micro and small enterprises (MSMEs), have little protection against such sudden public events for the first time.
根据美团研究院2019年12月发布的数据，2019年我国密室行业市场规模有望突破100亿，是2018年的2倍。
According to data released by the American Academy of Sciences in December 2019, the market for back-room rooms in 2019 is expected to exceed 10 billion, twice the 2018 figure.
2019年密室门店已经超过1万家，以北京、上海、川渝为中心分布在全国各地。
In 2019, there were more than 10,000 back-room shops in China, centered on Beijing, Shanghai and Sichuan-Yuyu.
危机之下，他们能做得很有限。
In times of crisis, they can do very little.
对于像他们这样的小微企业主，开源基本不会成为选择，因为他们并不确定，撑着走下去会不会还是走向死亡的终点，所以并不敢冒风险继续增加投入，裁员、关店就变成了大多数人的选择。
For micro and small business owners like them, open source is hardly an option, because they are not sure if they will still make it to the end of their lives, so they don't dare to take the risk of further investment.
王裕坤告诉燃财经，中小企业的影响是被关注到的，还有一些自由职业者，他们的损失还没有被看到。
'The impact of small and medium-sized enterprises is being noticed, 'Mr. Wang says.' There are some freelancers whose losses haven't been seen.
他们旗下有一家做公关活动的兄弟公司，他同时也是这家公司的联合创始人。
They have a sister company that does PR activities, and he's co-founder of the company.
疫情既让他们的活动公司损失了一部分线下会展业务，也让潮玩业务无法通过线下参展的方式售卖玩具产品。
The epidemic has left their mobile companies losing some of their offline convention and exhibition businesses, as well as their offline sales of toy products.
国内的潮玩行业处于起步期。
The domestic tide play industry is in its infancy.
除了几家大公司，很多独立玩具设计师的主要售卖方式都是先参加线下玩具展，让外界认识自己，然后再通过线上抽奖销售一部分产品。
Many independent toy designers, with the exception of a few large companies, first attend an offline toy show to get to know themselves and then sell some of their products through an online raffle.
所谓线上抽奖，简单来说，就是组建微信群，通过买家抽取购买资格或者有机会免费抽中奖品的方式来沉淀真正的消费者。
Online raffle, simply put, is the formation of micro-groups, through the purchase of qualified buyers or have the opportunity to win prizes for free precipitation of the real consumers.
。
.
刚结束不久的Wonder Festival2020冬季展图 / 受访者提供玩具展取消或延期，直接波及到了最近一年出道的新设计师。
The newly released Wonder Festival 2020 Winter Exhibition / Offer of Toy Exhibitions was cancelled or postponed, directly affecting new designers who made their debut in the past year.
王裕坤介绍：“玩具展上可能几百家参展商，绝大多数都是独立设计师，产能很小。
"There may be hundreds of exhibitors at the toy fair, most of which are independent designers with little production capacity," Wang said.
产品大多都要靠设计师自己掏钱生产、自己宣传、自己消化售卖。
Most products have to rely on designers to pay for their own production, self-promotion, their own digestion sales.
”最终，这些个体设计师要独自承担所有的积压风险。
Eventually, these individual designers will have to bear all the risk of backlogs alone.
没有了线下展会、没有了这一波小众人群的集中看展，连带着所有设计师的线上社群抽奖销售都受到了影响。
Without offline exhibitions, without this concentration of small crowds, with all the designers online community raffle sales have been affected.
倒下的影响不仅是裁员还有行业信心除了中小企业和自由职业者，疫情也给知名企业和垂直赛道的头部企业带来了不同的压力。
The fallout was not just layoffs but also industry confidence. In addition to SMEs and freelancers, the epidemic is putting a different strain on well-known companies and vertical track head companies.
十二栋文化的几家夹机占赶在春节前开了业，店内有大量玩偶公仔和抓娃娃机的夹机占，选址都是城市里人流量大的黄金地段，且占地面积不小。
The 12-culture gripper opened its doors just before the Spring Festival, with a large number of dolls and dolls-clutching machines, all located in the city's high-traffic prime location, and no small area.
今年年初，十二栋文化新开了5家面积在400平米以上的大型门店。
At the beginning of this year, 12 new culture in the area of more than five 400 square meters opened large stores.
突如其来的疫情打乱了他们的计划，也让公司陷入到巨大的现金流压力中。
The sudden outbreak disrupted their plans and put the company under enormous cash flow pressure.
十二栋文化位于疫情中心武汉的新店尤为有代表性。
The 12 new shops in Wuhan, the epicentre of the epidemic, are especially representative.
1月14日，“LLJ夹机占”武汉楚河汉街店试营业，它是十二栋文化迄今为止最大的一家线下店，门店面积近1000平方米。
On January 14, "LLJ Jiejie" Wuhan Chuhe Han Jidian trial operation, it is 12 culture so far the largest offline shop, shop area of nearly 1000 square meters.
随着疫情形势越来越严重，开业10天后这家店铺就关门停业了。
Ten days after the outbreak of the disease, the store closed down.
随后，十二栋在北京、上海等其他7个城市的十几家门店，也分别营业调整或停业。
Subsequently, 12 other seven cities in Beijing, Shanghai and a dozen stores, respectively, business adjustment or closure.
今年1月，十二栋文化在武汉新开的“LLJ夹机站”十二栋文化COO乱乱告诉燃财经，十二栋文化60%营收都依赖线下。
In January, 12 cultures opened in Wuhan's newly opened "LLJ sandwich station" 12 culture COO chaos told the burning economy, 12 culture 60% of revenue depends on the line.
他们原本是一家由线上业务转到线下的公司，由IP形象设计、打造和运营延展到周边产品和抓娃娃店这样的新业态。
They were originally a company that moved from online to offline, with IP images designed, built, and operated in a new fashion, extending into peripheral products and doll stores.
按照原定计划，2020年属于十二栋文化的快速扩张期，今年本来计划新开20家门店。
The plan was for a period of rapid expansion of twelve cultures in 2020, with 20 new stores planned for this year.
疫情发生后，货物紧缺倒不是他们的问题。
After the outbreak, the shortage of goods was not their problem.
为配合春节期间的营业，十二栋文化在年前就囤了一大批各类公仔娃娃，并为此支付了一个月80万的仓储费。
To tie in with the Spring Festival holiday, 12 different cultures hoarded a large number of dolls a year ago and paid 800,000 yuan a month for storage.
相比普通的玩具比如手办类，毛绒公仔体积更大一些，公仔的库存导致的短期仓储费用反倒成了现金流压力的一大来源。
Short-term storage costs from the stock of male offspring are a big source of cash-flow pressure, compared with regular toys such as hand-held, plush-dusted dolls.
。
.
“LLJ夹机站”武汉店年前开完武汉新店后，乱乱预估春节期间的月流水能做到3000万左右，而现在流水基本归零。
Wuhan shop opened the new Wuhan shop years ago, chaos during the Spring Festival estimated that the monthly water can do about 30 million, but now water basically to zero.
不仅如此，他们每个月的房租和人力支出还要近千万元。
What's more, they spend nearly ten million yuan a month on rent and manpower.
头部企业的倒闭和裁员也会对行业信心产生巨大影响。
The collapse of head companies and layoffs will also have a huge impact on confidence in the industry.
如果说对某一个个体线下文娱企业面临的现金流问题还有解，那假如大量企业没有熬过去，从业人员的离开、转行也会影响整个行业的信心，尤其是近两年才有一定起色的文创领域。
If the cash flow problems facing a certain individual online entertainment enterprises are still unsolved, if a large number of enterprises do not survive, the departure of workers, professional change will also affect the confidence of the industry, especially in the past two years have a certain improvement in the field of literature and creativity.
“站在这个角度，我们也不能轻易裁员，我们本身算比较头部的，如果我们开始裁员，行业会相对不稳定。
"From this perspective, we can't just lay off people, we're head-to-head, and if we start laying off people, the industry is relatively unstable.
”对于乱乱来说，她更担心疫情过后的危机。
For the chaos, she worries more about the post-epidemic crisis.
“相比于餐饮、旅游这些刚需行业，文创行业的恢复会更加滞后。
"Compared to catering, tourism and other new industries, the recovery of creative industries will lag further.
“疫情过去后一个月的时间，餐饮和旅游就会恢复，但我们可能需要两个月。
"Food and travel will resume a month after the outbreak, but we may need two months.
”受疫情影响，娱乐巨头迪士尼公司也关闭了中国境内上海和香港两个乐园。
Entertainment giant Disney Co. has also closed two parks in China, Shanghai and Hong Kong, affected by the outbreak.
1月25日起，迪士尼关闭了上海迪士尼、迪士尼小镇和星愿公园，已购买的门票和演出票可通过原购票渠道办理退款。
Disney shut down Shanghai Disneyland, Disneyland and Star Wishing Park on January 25, and tickets and tickets purchased can be refunded through the original ticket channel.
1月26日，香港迪士尼乐园也宣布关闭。
Hong Kong Disneyland was also declared closed on 26 January.
迪士尼首席财务官克里斯蒂娜·麦卡锡(Christine McCarthy)在2月11日迪士尼2020财年第一财季的电话会议上预估，两家迪士尼乐园的关闭将导致第二财季损失1.75亿美元。
Christine McCarthy, Disney's chief financial officer, estimated in a conference call on Feb. 11 for Disney's fiscal year 2020 that the two Disneyland closures would cost $175 million in the second quarter.
主题乐园、体验和产品一直是迪士尼的主营业务，2020年第一财季迪士尼这部分的收入为73.96亿美元，占总营收35.46%。
Theme parks, experiences and products have been Disney's main business, accounting for 35.46% of Disney's revenue in the first quarter of 2020, at $7.396 billion.
迪士尼主题乐园的游客数量已经持续下降了一段时间，此次疫情又加剧了这一业务的增长问题。
The number of visitors to Disney's theme park has been falling for some time, and the epidemic is exacerbating the growth problem.
北京大学文化产业研究院副院长陈少峰表示，在此次疫情的冲击下，全国的线下文化娱乐业，初步估算损失或超百亿元，且现阶段冲击仍将持续一段时间，这也意味着线下娱乐业的相关经营者上半年的收益都可能折损。
Chen Shaofeng, vice-dean of the Institute of Cultural Industry at Peking University, said the impact of the epidemic, the country's offline cultural entertainment industry, or the initial estimate of losses of over 10 billion yuan, and the current shock will continue for some time, which also means that related operators in the offline entertainment industry may lose out in the first half.
自救，将目光转移到线上加快线上产品的研发节奏、开展线上业务成为线下文化娱乐类企业拓展收入来源的重要通道。
Self-help, to accelerate the pace of online product development, online business has become an important offline culture entertainment enterprises to expand the source of income.
但线上一定是解药吗？虽然增加线上渠道能够开源，但短期内企业依然需要大力节流。
But must the line be the antidote? While adding online channels can open source, companies still need to cut back in the short term.
泡泡玛特的门店加上自动售卖机有近1000个销售点位，受疫情影响关闭了三分之一。
Bubbles Matt's stores plus vending machines close to 1000 sales points, affected by the epidemic closed a third.
剩下营业的门店，客流量也很少。
The remaining shops are open, and the traffic is small.
“我们现在把上半年的工作重点，放到了线上渠道经营。
"We are now focusing on the first half of the work, on-line channel management.
”泡泡玛特有一款小程序“泡泡抽盒机”，通过虚拟盲盒商店，消费者抽取盲盒之后也可以选择邮寄到家。
"Bubbles Markett features a small program called" bubble wrap, "which lets consumers choose to mail home after taking a blind box from a virtual box store.
乱乱表示，十二栋文化也在加快线上布局，3月左右就会推出第一代线上版本。
Twelve cultures are also speeding up online layouts, with a first-generation online version due around March, it said.
通过粉丝经济变现，淘宝、天猫、有赞等电商平台售卖毛绒玩具外，开启直播变现，尝试抖音等平台，同时开发线上小程序、H5等。
Through fan economic realisation, Taobao, Tiantas, praise and other electrical platforms sell plush toys, open live broadcast cash, try dithering platform, and develop online apps, H5, etc.
王裕坤最近一周也忙着增加自家店铺之外的其他线上销售渠道。
Mr. Wang has also been busy adding other online sales outlets to his store in the past week.
“很多微信公众号都有自己的销售平台，众筹平台摩点的线上众筹方式我们也都去谈了。
"A lot of micro-public brands have their own sales platforms, and we've talked about crowdfunding online for crowdfunding platforms."
”他提到，除了电商平台，玩具企业最常用的方式就是和公众号合作以及发起众筹。
In addition to the e-commerce platform, the most popular way for toy companies to work with the public is to co-operate with the public and sponsor crowdfunding, he said.
现阶段，众筹相对预售，更利于解决玩具企业及独立设计师的现金流问题。
At this stage, crowdfunding relative to pre-sale, more conducive to solve the cash flow problems of toy enterprises and independent designers.
玩具领域的众筹和其他行业的众筹方式类似，发起者通过众筹获得的资金，平台会优先给到发起者。
Crowdfunding in the toy industry is similar to crowdfunding in other industries, where sponsors get funding through crowdfunding, with the platform going to the sponsor first.
而电商平台的预售直到买家真正收到货，卖家才能把钱拿到手。
And the electric business platform pre-sale until the buyer actually received the goods, the seller can get the money.
除此之外，线上潮玩产品的客单价也无法与线下玩具展的现场售卖相比。
In addition, the customer unit price of online tidal play products can not be compared with the offline toy exhibition on-site sales.
王裕坤是资深玩家，每次参展，他都要购买至少两万块以上的玩具。
Wang Yu-kun is a senior player, each time the exhibition, he wants to buy at least 20, 000 pieces of toys.
每年大大小小的玩具展，根据他的观察，线上消费单价在400-500元左右的比较常见，而核心用户参加线下玩具展人均消费可过万元 。
According to his observations, annual toy exhibitions, large and small, cost around 400-500 yuan per unit for online consumption, while core users can spend more than $10,000 per person for an offline toy exhibition.
“很多玩家都喜欢在玩具展上集中购买。
"A lot of players like to shop centrally at toy shows.
”王裕坤告诉燃财经，对于他们那些单价在一千元左右的玩具，线上销售非常受影响。
Mr. Wang told Flaming Finance that online sales of toys with unit prices of about 1,000 yuan were 'very affected.
Dragon Stone奥石的Moddy恶搞系列QuestMobile2020中国移动互联网“战疫”专题报告显示，全网用户单日总时长61.1亿小时，视频游戏飙涨，在线生活迎来爆发，视频、游戏两大领域占比上涨至38%，快手、抖音与节前相比日活用户增量均超过4000万。
According to the Dragon Stone's Moddy 2020 China Mobile Internet "plague" presentation, users are spending 6.11 billion hours a day, video games are soaring, online life is about to break out, video and games account for 38% of the total, and fast-hand, chatter and pre-festival daily user increments of more than 40 million.
也就是说，对于很多想借助线上获客的企业，短时期这种阶段性利用线上平台的玩法很合适。
In other words, for many companies who want to take advantage of online customers, this short-term staged use of the online platform is very appropriate.
但很多线下文娱公司转线上，并不能立刻产生效果。
But many of the offline entertainment companies are on the line and do not have an immediate effect.
对王裕坤来说，抖音、快手这类平台没有玩具爱好者的分享基因，玩家群体之间也不会通过这些平台交流。
For Mr. Wang, platforms such as chatter and fast hands don't share genes with toy lovers, and players don't communicate with each other through those platforms.
另一方面，与其他渠道合作意味着要有一定的折扣，正常时期，很多独立设计师并不愿分掉这一部分利润。
On the other hand, working with other sources means there is a certain amount of discount that many independent designers are not willing to share in normal times.
而此时选择增加线上渠道，也可以说是特殊时期的特殊手段。
At this time to choose to increase the online channel, can also be said to be a special period of special means.
疫情毕竟不是常态，是否需要针对这一特殊时间段进行线上布局也无法一概而论，但疫情也敲响了警钟，借此企业也会重新思考线上和线下的价值。
After all, the epidemic is not normal, and the need for an online layout for this particular period of time cannot be generalized, but the epidemic is also a wake-up call for companies to rethink both online and offline values.
线上剧本杀App“我是谜”属于此次疫情的受益者，春节期间数据增长了一倍多，App曾排到苹果商店社交榜第三名。
Online script kills App "I Am Mystery" is one of the beneficiaries of the epidemic, with data more than doubling during Spring Festival, with App once ranked third on Apple's social-networking list.
相关负责人表示，对于线下剧本杀门店的影响只是短期的，线上积累的用户最终要回归线下。
The person in charge said that the impact of the offline script to kill stores is only short-term, the online accumulation of users will eventually have to return to the line.
“线上对用户引导、用户留存、交易市场的成本大大降低了，对我们长远来看是一件好事。
"The cost of online user-to-user guidance, user retention, and trading has dropped dramatically, and that's a good thing for us in the long run.
未来线上市场还要继续扩大，但线下也是完成产业链闭环不可缺少的。
The online market will continue to expand in the future, but it is also indispensable to complete the industrial chain.
”泰合资本高级投资经理石松源表示，此次疫情的影响，长期看可能会刺激用户付费习惯的形成，在整个线上文娱领域的预算增加，有利于打开一些行业的天花板，比如受制于用户付费率不足而产生瓶颈的电竞、小众社区、独立游戏、知识付费等。
Mr Ishik, senior investment manager at Thai Capital, said the impact of the outbreak was likely to spur fee-paying habits in the long run, with budget increases across the online entertainment sector helping to unlock ceilings in industries such as telecoms, minority communities, independent games and pay-for-knowledge, which are constrained by inadequate user fees.
他认为，疫情前就已经是重度用户的用户行为不会有明显的迁移，但是轻中度用户以及在疫情中被培养起习惯的一部分留存增量用户，行为会有更大的重塑，例如线上观影、会员付费、直播互动等。
There will be no significant shift in user behavior from pre-epidemic heavy users, he said, but moderate to light users and part of the habits developed in the epidemic will retain incremental users, with greater behavioural modification, such as online viewing, member payments, live interactions, etc.
对于很多线下企业来说，能用的自救措施都在使用。
For many offline businesses, the available self-help measures are in use.
现阶段他们的诉求是希望能看到一些利好政策。
Their appeal at this stage is to see some positive policies.
很多投资人在疫情期间频繁提到企业至少要有6-12个月的现金储备，乱乱认为对中小企业来说并不现实。
Many investors frequently mentioned during the outbreak that companies needed at least 6-12 months of cash reserves, which was considered unrealistic for SMEs.
很多中小企业都是处于发展期，营收与成本打平已经算不错的状态。
Many small and medium-sized enterprises are in the period of development, revenue and cost leveling has been a good state.
基本不会有盈余来抵御这类十几年一遇的特殊风险。
There is little surplus to fend off such exceptional risks, which have been around for more than a decade.
