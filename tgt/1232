”根据工信部官微信息显示，中国生产口罩的速度已经很快，0.5秒就能生产一只。
According to Ministry of Industry and Communications official micro-information, China has been making masks rapidly, producing one in half a second.
那为什么口罩供应依旧紧张？随着公众对口罩产业的关注，环氧乙烷等化学名词进入了大家的视野。
Why, then, is the supply of masks still tight? As the public focus on the mask industry, chemicals such as ethylene oxide have come into focus.
这一物质直接影响到医用口罩的供应。
This substance directly affects the supply of medical masks.
环氧乙烷是乙烯工业衍生物中的重要有机化工产品，通常由乙烯和纯氧在纯银催化下反应生成，被广泛应用在洗涤、制药和印染等行业，是目前最好的冷消毒剂之一。
Ethylene oxide is an important organic chemical product in the ethylene industry. It is usually produced by ethylene and pure oxygen catalyzed by pure silver. It is widely used in the washing, pharmaceutical and dyeing industries and is one of the best cold disinfectants.
医用口罩一般使用环氧乙烷进行灭菌。
Medical masks are usually sterilized with ethylene oxide.
但环氧乙烷是一种有毒致癌物质。
But ethylene oxide is a toxic carcinogen.
口罩灭菌后，表面残留的环氧乙烷，需要通过解析的方式释放，达到安全含量的标准并质检合格后，才能出厂上市，这拉长了口罩进入市场的时间。
After the mask is sterilized, the residual ethylene oxide on the surface needs to be released analytically to meet the safety standards and pass the quality inspection before it can be marketed, which lengthens the time for the mask to enter the market.
2月8日，在回应为何中国口罩生产速度快却仍面临紧缺的情况时，工信部在官方微博中指出，口罩生产后要经历解析消毒的标准流程，这需要耗时七天至半个月不等。
On Feb. 8, in response to an official microblog about why China still faces a shortage of masks, the ministry said in an official microblog that it would take seven days to half a month for the mask to undergo a standard process of disinfection.
除口罩外，医用绷带、缝线、手术器具以及诸多不耐高温仍需消毒的物品，都使用环氧乙烷来消毒。
In addition to masks, medical bandages, sutures, surgical instruments and many items that are not resistant to high temperatures and still require sterilization are sterilized with ethylene oxide.
新型冠状肺炎疫情之下，口罩等医疗器材需求猛增，消毒剂环氧乙烷的用量也随之增长。
With the new type of coronary pneumonia, the demand for medical devices such as masks surged, and the use of ethylene oxide as a disinfectant increased.
那该产品的供需情况如何，价格是否会出现上涨？联创统计数据显示，目前国内环氧乙烷的总体产能约470万吨，中石化下属炼化企业是主要生产商，还有部分产能较大的民营企业，包括三江化工、泰兴金燕和江苏斯尔邦等。
The company's overall production capacity is about 4.7 million tons, with Sinopec's refiners being the main producers and some of the larger private-sector companies, including Sanjiang Chemical, Taixing Jinyan and Jiangsu Sal.
由于环氧乙烷易燃易爆和不耐长途运输的特性，该产品还具有很强的地域性。
Because of the flammability of ethylene oxide and its resistance to long-distance transportation, the product also has a strong regional.
从地区看，主要产能聚集在华东地区。
Regionally, much of the production capacity is concentrated in eastern China.
金联创分析师赵鹏翡对界面新闻记者表示，环氧乙烷用于一次性使用的无菌医疗消毒器械灭菌剂的用量十分有限，用量占比不足2%；生产聚羧酸减水剂单体的用量占比超50%，其次是用于表面活性剂、乙醇胺系列、聚醚等物的生产，总计占比约48%。
Zhao Peng Jie, an analyst at Jinlianchang, told the Interface News that ethylene oxide was used for sterilization of sterile medical disinfection devices in a limited amount of less than 2%, that the production of polycarboxylic acid water reducer monomer accounted for more than 50%, followed by surfactants, ethanolamine series, polyethers and so on, accounting for about 48%.
由于占比较小，医疗耗材需求量的上升，对原材料价格的抬升十分有限。
Due to its small size, the demand for medical consumables has increased, the price of raw materials has increased very limited.
环氧乙烷的价格一直在低位稳定徘徊。
The price of ethylene oxide has been stable and low.
隆众资讯统计数据显示，环氧乙烷的市场价格自去年11月以来一直较为稳定，华南、华东和华北等市场多保持吨价7600-7800元左右。
The market price of ethylene oxide has remained stable since November, with more than 7,600 to 7,800 yuan in south, east and north China, according to figures from the Ministry of Commerce.
主要生产商的环氧乙烷价格变动。
Change in price of ethylene oxide for major producers.
图片来源：隆众资讯疫情对于环氧乙烷需求的拉动不明显，但交通运输受阻让环氧乙烷产业原料进不来、产品出不去。
Source: Epoxy Epoxy did not significantly pull the demand for information epidemic, but traffic obstruction let the ethylene oxide industry raw materials, products can not get out.
隆众资讯指出，本周内，环氧乙烷市场供应与需求均保持冷淡态势，多地装置低负荷运行，华东、华北、华中等地共五套环氧乙烷装置停产，包括燕山石化、中沙石化和武汉石化等。
During the week, China's ethylene oxide market remained frosty in terms of supply and demand, with many units operating at low capacity, with five ethylene oxide plants being shut down in East, North and Central China, including Yanshan Petrochemical Company, Zhongsha Petrochemical Company and Wuhan Petrochemical Company.
赵鹏翡表示，目前环氧乙烷下游产业及终端复工进程缓慢，物流暂未畅通，整体产业链供需仍然不畅，节后东北地区的环氧乙烷价格还出现小部分下降。
At present, at present, the downstream industry of ethylene oxide and its terminal are slow to resume work, logistics is still not smooth, supply and demand for the overall industrial chain remain patchy, and the price of ethylene oxide in the northeast after the holiday has fallen to a small extent.
这也与口罩的另一项基础原材料——聚丙烯的市场行情类似。
This is similar to the market for polypropylene, another basic material for masks.
口罩需求的增长，难以对聚丙烯整体供需情况产生明显冲击，聚丙烯价格持续处于下滑态势。
Mask demand growth, the overall supply and demand for polypropylene difficult to have a significant impact on the overall situation, polypropylene prices continue to decline.
