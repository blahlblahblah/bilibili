深度和角度——这就是我们能做的。

如果你发现自己每天接触的关于疫情的信息，超过你每天接收总的信息量的40%，也就是说你大部分的时间都在接收这些信息，并且因此干扰到了自身情绪甚至日常生活，那么你要主动去做点别的事，尽可能把关注点转移到自己日常感兴趣的东西，这是一种积极的自我“心理防护”。
If you find yourself daily exposed to more than 40% of the total amount of information you receive each day, meaning that you spend most of your time receiving that information, and it interferes with your mood and even your daily life, then you should do something else and focus as much as possible on what interests you daily.
文 |黄　祺新冠肺炎疫情还在继续，不少人已经在家“闷了”一个春节，有的人开始“闷闷不乐”了，焦虑与烦躁的情绪滋生着。
New Year's Eve pneumonia continues to plague Huang Qi. Many people are already at home for the Lunar New Year, with some feeling depressed and irritable.
2月6日的上海市政府新闻发布会上，上海市精神卫生中心党委书记、主任医师谢斌对宅在家里的市民给出了一条生活建议：“该追星追星，该追剧追剧。
At a press conference on Feb. 6, Xie Bin, secretary and chief physician of the Shanghai Mental Health Center, gave advice on life to homebound residents: "The Star Hunter, the drama pursuer.
”传染病是一种特殊的公共事件。
Infectious disease is a special public event.
普通人的日常生活，本来就是需要交流、接触与沟通的。
The ordinary people's daily life, originally needs the communication, the contact and the communication.
按道理，在恐惧与焦虑气氛中，人更需要互相支持和安慰。
In an atmosphere of fear and anxiety, people need each other's support and comfort.
但为了避免传染，人和人之间又必须拉开距离。
But in order to avoid contagion, people have to keep their distance.
这种特殊性让一些原本就容易焦虑的人，很容易陷入负面情绪，难以自拔。
This kind of particularity makes some people easily anxious in the beginning, easily fall into the negative mood, unable to extricate themselves.
昨天，谢斌主任接受了《新民周刊》的采访。
Yesterday, director Xie Bin gave an interview to Xinmin Weekly.
他提醒，特殊时期大家更要重视自己的心理健康，如果发现自己有焦虑的倾向，要主动屏蔽过量的负面信息。
He cautions that people should value their mental health more in special times, and actively block too much negative information if they find themselves prone to anxiety.
“好的心态对个人是最好的免疫力，正常的秩序对于社会来说也是最好的免疫力。
"A good mind is the best immunity for the individual, and a normal order is the best immunity for society.
”宅在家特别焦虑怎么办？_《新民周刊》：____前几天您在新闻发布会上说建议大家“该追剧追剧，该追星追星”，这个是针对什么现象做出的提示？____谢斌：____大多数的普通市民，不是医护人员，也不是抗疫一线的工作人员，没有非常紧要的工作，是通过宅在家里配合疫情防控。
What about the special anxiety in your hometownYou said at a news conference the other day that you suggested that you should "pursue the drama, the star-chasing star," which is a reminder of what this phenomenon is all about.Most ordinary citizens, neither medical personnel nor frontline staff, have no critical work, but rather work at home with disease prevention and control.
所以我这些话是对这类市民说的。
So these words of mine are addressed to this class of citizens.
新闻发布会上我讲到，重大疫情中，适度的焦虑对于大众来讲是难免的，也有一定必要性，有助于引起市民的重视，采取积极措施防控疫情。
At the press conference, I said that moderate anxiety is inevitable for the general public, but also necessary to help arouse public attention and take active measures to prevent and control the epidemic.
但是，市民朋友们需要避免过度的焦虑和恐慌。
But citizen friends need to avoid excessive anxiety and panic.
长期宅在家里的市民，没什么事情做的话，时间长了会出现很多情绪问题。
Long-term residents at home, nothing to do, time will appear a lot of emotional problems.
这段时间，媒体播报的也主要是疫情的新闻，朋友圈里也几乎都是有关疫情的消息。
During this time, the media also mainly broadcast the news of the epidemic, friends are almost all about the epidemic news.
如果一个人处在一个封闭的环境，接收的信息都是同一个，而这个信息又是比较负面的，如果一直聚焦在这个信息上，即便没有处在现实危险中，人们也很容易产生恐惧、焦虑等应激反应，甚至对自身健康产生担心。
If a person is in a closed environment and receives the same information, and the message is negative, if kept focused on this message, people can easily develop stress reactions such as fear, anxiety and even fear for their own health, even if they are not in real danger.
____《新民周刊》：____我们发现，同样是宅在家，有的人会比另一些人更容易焦虑，这是什么原因？____谢斌：____应激产生的情绪反应，主要受到两方面的影响，一个是个体的心理素质，一个是外界的刺激，专业上叫“应激源”。
What is the reason why _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ New People's Weekly: We found that some people tend to be more anxious than others when they are also at home.
如果一个人产生了明显的焦虑情绪，往往是这两个因素的共同作用结果。
If a person develops significant anxiety, it is often the result of a combination of these two factors.
也就是说，他本身有容易焦虑的个性，又受到了比较严重的外界刺激。
In other words, he has his own anxious personality, and has been more serious external stimulation.
所以说，如果意识到自己容易焦虑，这样的人更需要主动地屏蔽部分负面的信息，把注意力转移到其他事情上，这样有助于降低焦虑水平。
So, if you're aware that you're prone to anxiety, such people are more likely to actively block some of the negative information and turn their attention to something else, which can help reduce anxiety levels.
作为“应激源”的外界信息，有的本身虽然准确，但是比较负面，比如：已有多少人染病、多少人死亡等等；也有许多信息是不科学的，甚至是谣言。
As a "source of stress," some of the external information, although accurate, but more negative, such as: how many people have been infected, how many people died, and so on; there is also a lot of information is unscientific, even rumour.
所以当面对疫情时，被动地屏蔽负面的刺激虽然重要，主动地提升科学素养，掌握科学的信息则更加重要，这有助于我们增加自我效能感，减少因无知而带来的恐慌。
So while it is important to passively block negative stimuli in the face of an epidemic, it is even more important to proactively improve scientific literacy, which helps us to increase our sense of self-efficacy and reduce panic caused by ignorance.
____《新民周刊》：____对特别容易焦虑的人， 对他们有什么建议？____谢斌：____如果你发现自己每天接触的关于疫情的信息，超过你每天接收总的信息量的40%，也就是说你大部分的时间都在接收这些信息，并且因此干扰到了自身情绪甚至日常生活，那么你要主动去做点别的事，尽可能把关注点转移到自己日常感兴趣的东西，这是一种积极的自我“心理防护”。
What advice do you have for people who are particularly anxious? _ _ _ _ _ If you find yourself receiving more than 40% of the information you receive on a daily basis, that is, more than 40% of the total information you receive every day, and thus interfere with your mood or even your daily life.
____谢斌主任给大家7条建议____1.保持与疫情之前基本一致的生活节奏。
Director Xie Bin gives you 7 suggestions to maintain the same rhythm of life as before the outbreak.
2.每天如果没有特殊工作需要处理，要安排自己做些需要专注的事情如看书、画画等。
If you don't have a special task to do each day, schedule yourself to do something that requires concentration, such as reading, drawing, etc.
3. 适当的运动（每天不少于30分钟中等以上强度的运动即可有效舒缓情绪）。
3. Exercise Appropriate exercise (no less than 30 minutes of moderate or more exercise per day will be effective in relieving mood).
4. 控制每天接受疫情相关信息的时间和信息量。
4. To control the amount of time and information received on a daily basis about the epidemic.
5. 学习一些放松技巧（如肌肉松弛训练、瑜伽等）。
5. Learn relaxation techniques (such as muscle relaxation, yoga, etc.).
6. 主动接受专业帮助（如果经过自我调整后，还是无法解决失眠、惊恐、强迫等表现，不妨寻求专业帮助。
Volunteer for professional help (if you still can't cope with insomnia, panic, compulsion, etc.), seek professional help.
比如通过市卫建委的“上海健康云”接受线上咨询，关注上海市精神卫生中心的官方微信或者拨打021-12320-5，接受在线心理健康服务等）。
Take, for example, online counselling via the "Shanghai Healthy Cloud" of the municipal health committee, follow the official letter from the Shanghai Mental Health Center or call 021-12320-5 to receive online mental health services, etc.
7. 保证睡眠（成年人每天的睡眠时间最好不少于7个小时，儿童少年还要多一些）。
7. Get enough sleep (preferably no less than seven hours a day for adults and a little more for children and adolescents).
此外，对于医务人员或者专门从事防控相关工作的人员来说，还可以通过建立心理互助小组相互开展心理慰藉和支持；适当降低工作成效的期望值；加强轮班休息等方式来减压。
In addition, for medical personnel or staff specializing in prevention and control, psychological support and support can be provided to each other through the establishment of mutual psychological support groups; the expectations of work effectiveness can be lowered appropriately; and work shifts are strengthened to reduce stress.
专业版的在线心理评估、音频视频心理解压材料等也可提供帮助。
Professional online psychological assessment, audio-visual psychological decompression material and so on can also provide help.
____生活还要继续，社会要逐步恢复正常_复工首日的上海地铁 图片来源 |新民晚报《新民周刊》：____这次疫情还在继续，大家都不知道什么时候才能恢复正常生活。
Life will continue and society will gradually return to normal. & # 160; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; New
这种状态是不是特别容易引起心理上的问题？____谢斌：____是的，越是未知，越容易感到恐惧。
Is this state of affairs particularly susceptible to psychological problems? _ _ _ Xie Bin: _ _ _ Yes, the more unknown, the more likely it is to be afraid.
所以我认为，在严格管理、大家坚持做好个人防护的前提下，还是应该有序复工，让社会慢慢恢复到正常的运转状态，这也有助于提升整个社会的免疫力。
So I think that under the premise of strict management and personal protection, we should resume work in an orderly manner so that the society can return to normal operation, which will also help to raise the immunity of the whole society.
社会生活正常以后，对个人心理也会产生保护作用。
When social life is normal, it will also have a protective effect on individual psychology.
我们应当有这样的信心：市民和回沪人员只要精诚团结，维护好社会秩序，全市防控形势即便短期带来一定压力，中长期也定能持续向好。
We should have the confidence that as long as citizens and people back to Shanghai as long as sincere unity, maintain good social order, city-wide prevention and control situation even if the short-term bring some pressure, the medium- and long-term will certainly continue to improve.
____上海复工首日 图片来源 |新民晚报《新民周刊》：____和其他的事件相比，传染病是不是更容易给人们带来精神上的压力？____谢斌：___汶川地震、印尼海啸等大灾中，当地人的精神伤害也很大。
2007-9-25 21: 48 Do infectious diseases cause mental distress more easily than other events? _ _ _ _ Xie Bin: The local population suffered greatly in major disasters such as the _ _ Wenchuan earthquake and the Indonesian tsunami.
但是传染病带给人的精神压力，是不一样的。
But the mental stress of infectious diseases is not the same.
天灾之后，大家考虑的是要团结，要抱团取暖，灾难会拉近人与人之间的距离。
In the aftermath of natural disasters, we are thinking of solidarity, of getting warm, of bringing people closer together.
但传染病呢，它会对人与人之间的关系造成破坏，因为要防范患者、要隔离观察等等，人际间的压力更突出。
Infectious diseases, on the other hand, can damage relationships because interpersonal stress is more pronounced when it comes to prevention, isolation, and so on.
因此在疫情中，我们更需要相互理解和支持，来减轻这种压力。
Therefore, in an epidemic, we need mutual understanding and support to reduce such pressures.
如果人与人之间在心理上也互相防着，污名患者、歧视某些地区的人，这对疾病的尽快控制、对社会正常秩序的恢复将非常不利。
If people also guard each other psychologically, stigmatizing people and discriminating against people in certain areas, this will do great harm to the speedy control of diseases and the restoration of normal social order.
____《新民周刊》：____我们可以想象，在湖北这样患者比较多的地方，很多人心理上都会有负担。
We can imagine that in places like Hubei, where there are many sufferers, many people will have a psychological burden.
最近上海市精神卫生中心专门抽出人员接听来自武汉的心理咨询电话，目前咨询量大吗？____谢斌：____目前我们没有全国统一的心理咨询号码。
Recently, Shanghai Mental Health Center has specially drawn out staff to answer the call from Wuhan, is the amount of consultation large?
我也呼吁，今后应该有一个像110、120这样的统一号码，整合资源为大家提供心理咨询服务。
I also call for a unified number like 110 and 120 to consolidate resources to provide counselling services.
新冠肺炎疫情发生后，上海的12320心理热线可以接受大家的咨询，上海的团队相对比较成熟，经验比较丰富。
After the outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia, Shanghai's 12320 psychological hotline can be consulted by you, the Shanghai team is relatively mature and rich experience.
最近应武汉方面的要求，我们也培训了30多位心理咨询师，安排了一条专线，接听武汉打过来的电话。
Recently, in response to Wuhan request, we also trained more than 30 psychological consultants, arranged a special line, to answer Wuhan call.
目前咨询量还不是太大，可能一方面是因为很多人不知道，还有就是武汉目前主要的精力还在救治病人。
At present the amount of consultation is not too big, probably because many people do not know, and Wuhan is still the main energy is still treating patients.
估计疫情相对平稳后，一些病人、隔离人员或者医护人员，在心理干预方面的需求会越来越大。
It is estimated that after the epidemic is relatively stable, some patients, isolation personnel or medical personnel, in the psychological intervention needs will be increasing.
____《新民周刊》：____一线的工作人员、基层干部特别辛苦，很多人超负荷工作，他们是不是需要特别关注到?____谢斌：____任何一个职业，只要是长期处于一种需要高度责任感的状态，日常生活被破坏，短期内又看不到工作成效，这样的工作早晚会让人出现“心理耗竭” ，尤其是助人的、利他的工作，更容易耗竭 。
2007-9-24 16: 23... New People's Weekend: People working in the line of _ _ _ are working very hard and many people are overworked. Do they need to pay special attention to any occupation that is chronically in a state of high responsibility, disrupted daily life and no short-term results?
所以基层干部、医护人员要注意这个问题。
So basic cadres and medical personnel should pay attention to this problem.
“心理耗竭”人群的主要表现有容易情绪崩溃，烦躁易怒，对工作产生厌倦，工作效率降低，出错概率增加等。
The main performance of the "psychological exhaustion" group is prone to emotional collapse, irritability, work fatigue, reduced work efficiency, increased probability of errors, etc.
这些状况不仅会影响人们的职业功能，甚至有可能影响家庭功能。
These conditions not only affect people's professional functions, but may even affect family functions.
所以他们特别需要做好心理防护。
So they especially need psychological protection.
我建议只要有机会，大家就要主动地转移注意力，学会放松，寻求心理安慰和团队支持。
I suggest that when given the opportunity, we should actively turn our attention away from our daily routine and learn to relax, seek psychological comfort and team support.
管理部门也要从制度上保障他们的健康，比如尽可能安排轮休，保证长时间工作的人员有机会“喘息”，营造相对适宜的工作环境条件等。
Management should also institutionalize their health, such as rotating breaks whenever possible, ensuring that people who work long hours have the opportunity to "breathe" and create relatively appropriate working conditions.
我看新闻里报道有人不眠不休超负荷工作，连轴转。
I read in the news that there are people who work long hours without sleep.
这个不应该鼓励，这样下去会有问题的。
This should not be encouraged. This is going to be a problem.
____疫情中关注心理健康，是一种进步_《新民周刊》：____上海的新冠肺炎病房里，有精神科医生入驻，上海赴武汉的医疗队中也有长宁区的精神科医生，我们对重大疫情中心理介入的重视，是从什么时候开始的？____谢斌：____虽然非典、汶川地震时已有心理干预介入，但上海比较明显的变化大概始于11.15火灾。
Attention to mental health in the context of the _ _ epidemic is a progressive _ New People's Weekly. In the Xinguan Pneumonia Ward in _ _ _ _ Shanghai, psychiatrists from Changning are present in the Shanghai medical team for Wuhan.
这些年精神科专家团队在湖北监利沉船、外滩踩踏等重大事件中，都发挥了重要的作用。
Over the years, the team of psychiatrists have played an important role in important events such as the sinking of Hubei prison ship and trampling on the Bund.
湖北监利沉船事件后，在去湖北处理善后时，因为有很多遇难者家属在那边，市领导第一时间就想到要带心理专家一起去。
After the Hubei prison shipwreck, in Hubei processing aftercare, because there are a lot of victims' families there, the city leaders first thought of bringing psychological experts with them.
社会对心理健康的重视有了巨大的进步。
Society's focus on mental health has made great progress.
上海有一套重大公共事件心理危机干预机制，一旦需要，我们就可以迅速响应。
Shanghai has a set of major public events psychological crisis intervention mechanism, as soon as needed, we can respond quickly.
新冠肺炎疫情发生后，上海专家组组长张文宏教授提出，隔离病房需要精神科医生，我们立即就派出了专家。
After the outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia, Shanghai expert group leader Professor Zhang Wenhong suggested that the isolation ward needed psychiatrists, we immediately sent experts.
医院当天就有近30位中级职称以上的医生请战报名。
On the same day, the hospital has nearly 30 doctors above the intermediate title to register.
1月26日，上海市精神卫生中心陈俊主任医师进驻市公卫中心隔离病房，给病人作心理疏导，同时也为病房的医护人员进行心理解压，效果比较理想。
On January 26, Dr. Chen Jun, director of the Shanghai Mental Health Center, entered the isolation ward of the Municipal Public Health Center to provide psychological guidance to the patients.
有的病人有冲动、失眠、过度焦虑恐慌等情绪问题，通过心理疏导以后，基本上都能够平复下来。
Some patients have impulsive, insomnia, excessive anxiety and panic, and other emotional problems, through psychological counseling, basically can calm down.
____《新民周刊》：____之前疫情重点地区发生了精神科专科医院院内感染的事件，有医护人员感染新冠肺炎。
Before _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ New People's Weekly: Infection occurred in the hospital yard of the psychiatric hospital in the key area of the epidemic before _ _ _ _.
上海市精卫中心针对疫情作了哪些措施？____谢斌：____精神专科医院的传染病防控能力相对薄弱。
What measures has the Shanghai Jingwei Center taken to deal with the epidemic? _ _ _ Xie Bin: The infectious disease control ability of _ _ _ specialized mental hospital is relatively weak.
所以疫情发生后，我们医院第一时间就做好了预案。
So after the outbreak of the epidemic, our hospital made a plan in the first time.
我们留出了专门的病区，一些必须要住院的患者，先到这个隔离病区观察两周，没有问题才转入普通病房。
We set aside a special section for patients who have to be hospitalized, first for two weeks in the quarantine area and then transferred to the general ward without any problems.
这个观察病房是按照发热病房的标准来防护的。
The observation ward is protected by the standards of the fever ward.
当前，没有必要住院指征的患者尽量门诊治疗，不建议住院。
At present, there is no need for hospitalization indication of patients as far as possible outpatient treatment, not recommended hospitalization.
对于一些身在外地的慢性患者，我们通过线上问诊，帮助解决一些有关疾病的咨询和随访，同时也建议他们在所在地配药。
For some chronic patients who are out of the country, we help solve some of the problems related to consultation and follow-up through on-line consultations, and we also advise them to dispense drugs in their localities.
我们也建立了严格的体温监测、消毒、员工关爱等制度。
We have also established strict temperature monitoring, disinfection, staff care and other systems.
严防院内发生感染是我们目前的头等大事。
Preventing infection in the compound is our top priority.
