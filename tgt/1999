国家发改委通知要求提前结束天然气旺季价格，并且下调基准门站价。
The National Development and Reform Commission called for an early end to peak gas prices and a reduction in benchmark prices.
至于具体降价多少，减免的用气费用上下游企业如何承担？目前暂无定论徐沛宇 | 文马克| 编辑国家发改委下发降气价通知两天后，天然气销售企业仍没制定出降价细则。
As for the specific price reduction, how the reduced gas cost will be borne by upstream and downstream companies? Two days after the NDRC issued a notice to cut gas prices, the companies still haven't worked out how much they will cut.
2月22日，为支持复工复产，国家发改委分别发布降低企业用气、用电成本的通知。
On 22 February, to support the resumption of production, the National Development and Reform Commission issued separate notices to reduce the cost of gas and electricity used by enterprises.
通知发布一天之内，国家电网公司和南方电网公司立即回应称，将自行承担相关费用，为大工业和一般工商业企业减免约595亿元电费。
Within a day of the announcement, State Grid and Southern Grid responded that they would bear the cost of cutting electricity bills to about 59.5 billion yuan for big industries and businesses in general.
而中石油、中石化和中海油三大天然气上游企业，截止发稿时尚未作出回应。
PetroChina, Sinopec and CNOOC, the three upstream natural gas companies, had not responded at the time of writing.
对降气价政策的回应缓慢，不能完全怪罪于三大油企。
The slow response to price cuts cannot be blamed entirely on the three big oil companies.
从销售流程来看，降气价的执行难度高于降电价。
From the point of view of sales flow, the implementation of gas price is more difficult than electricity price.
大多数企业用气不是直接从三大油企购买，而是通过各地的城市燃气公司等分销商购买。
Most businesses buy gas not directly from the Big Three, but through distributors such as local city gas companies.
大多数分销商给用气企业的销售价格，不完全是市场化定价，还需要经过当地政府部门的审批。
The selling prices of most distributors to gas-using companies are not entirely market-oriented and require approval by local government departments.
那么问题是，如果要降气价，天然气上下游的企业该各自承担多少成本？国家发改委亦深谙降气价的难题。
The question then is, if gas prices are to be cut, how much should downstream and upstream companies bear? The NDRC is also familiar with the problem of lowering gas prices.
在其发布的降电价通知里，明确了降电价的具体幅度，执行时间等要素。
In its release of the electricity price notice, the specific range of electricity price reduction, implementation time and other factors.
两大电网公司可以快速计算出自己所需承担的费用。
The two grid companies can quickly calculate their own costs.
而在降气价的通知里，遣词造句则模糊得多。
In the notification of the price reduction, the wording of the sentence is much more vague.
除了明确要求将非居民用气门站价格提前执行淡季价格政策之外，没有其他的定量标准，只用了“尽可能降低价格水平”等字眼。
There is no quantitative standard other than explicitly requiring non-residents to pre-empt off-season pricing with valve station prices, using only the words "to keep prices as low as possible."
天然气销售企业应该为非居民用户总共减免多少用气费用？通知里没有明确。
How much of the total reduction for non-resident users should be made by gas sellers? The notice is unclear.
业内人士预计，三大油企的降价细则可能还要等几天才能公布。
Industry insiders expect the details of the price cuts for the three big oil companies to wait a few days.
“领导们周末连开了两天会议讨论降价措施，目前尚未确定细则。
"The leaders have been meeting for two days over the weekend to discuss price cuts and details have not yet been worked out.
”中石油旗下的天然气销售公司某中层干部对《财经》记者说到。
A middle-level cadre at PetroChina's gas distribution company told Caijing.
多位城市燃气公司人士则对《财经》记者表示，暂未接到上游企业的降价通知，正在与地方政府沟通具体的降价措施。
Several city gas companies told Caijing that they had not yet received price reduction notices from upstream companies and were communicating with local governments about the specific price reduction measures.
降价幅度有多大每年11月底到来年3月中旬，是天然气销售旺季。
How much will the reduction be Every year between the end of November and the middle of March is the peak season for natural gas sales.
在此期间，天然气上游企业卖给分销商的非居民用气批发价，一般比淡季价格高出20%左右。
During this period, the wholesale price of non-resident gas sold by upstream natural gas companies to distributors was generally about 20 per cent higher than the off-season price.
此次降价政策里唯一可以确定的降价幅度是，这高出20%左右的旺季价格将提前近一个月结束。
The only firm price cut this time around is that it will end nearly a month ahead of the peak of about 20 per cent.
国家发改委在22日发布的通知里指出，天然气生产经营企业要提前执行淡季价格，自本通知印发之日起，对执行政府指导价的非居民用气，要以基准门站价格为基础适当下浮，尽可能降低价格水平；对价格已放开的非居民用气，鼓励天然气生产经营企业根据市场形势与下游用气企业充分协商沟通，降低价格水平。
Since the issuance of this Circular, non-resident gas producers and traders should float down as much as possible on the basis of benchmark station prices to minimize the price level. For non-resident gas prices that have been liberalized, natural gas producing and trading enterprises are encouraged to negotiate fully with downstream gas-using enterprises to reduce the price level according to market conditions.
与降电价政策明确提出从2020年2月1日算起不同，降气价的起始执行时间并未明确。
Unlike the electricity price reduction policy, which explicitly states that it will be different from 1 February 2020, the starting implementation time of the reduction price is not clear.
通知仅明确称，该通知有效期至2020年6月30日。
The notification simply stated that it would remain in force until 30 June 2020.
《财经》记者综合多方信息了解到，个别地区已经在上述通知发布前执行了降气价的政策，所以全国降气价的起始时间不便于统一。
Caijing reporter comprehensive multi-sources of information, individual regions have implemented the policy of reducing gas prices before the announcement, so the beginning of the national price of gas is not easy to harmonize.
再加上各地对降价细则的制定周期不同，也难以统一各地降价时间。
This, together with the different local price reduction rule-making cycle, also difficult to unify the local price reduction time.
根据国家发改委的通知原文，除了提前结束旺季价格，还要以基准门站价格为基础适当下浮。
According to the notice of the National Development and Reform Commission, in addition to the early end of peak prices, but also based on the base station prices appropriate floating.
至于具体下浮多少，主要看中石油、中石化和中海油三大上游天然气企业的态度。
As for how much to float, the main focus on PetroChina, Sinopec and CNOOC's three upstream natural gas enterprises attitude.
在国家发改委发布通知之前，湖北、浙江、安徽等地已发布了当地的降气价措施，多数地区的气价下调了10%，但执行时间长短不一。
Before the NDRC's announcement, Hubei, Zhejiang, Anhui and other places had announced local measures to cut gas prices, with most regions cutting gas prices by 10 per cent, but for varying periods of time.
湖北省执行周期最长：1月1日至6月30日，湖北省中小微企业工业用天然气价格按基准价下调10%执行。
Hubei province has the longest implementation cycle: From January 1 to June 30, the price of natural gas for industrial use by MSMEs in Hubei Province was lowered by 10 percent from the benchmark price.
安徽省的政策是：将中小微工业企业用天然气价格下调10%，将省天然气开发公司各价区短输价格在现行价格基础上降低10%，期限为3个月。
Anhui Province's policy is to reduce the price of natural gas by 10 per cent for MSMEs and by 10 per cent for three months from the current price for short transports in the various price zones of the Provincial Gas Development Corporation.
国家发改委对全国非居民用电价的降价幅度定为5%。
The National Development and Reform Commission has cut the price of electricity for non-residents nationwide by 5 per cent.
三大上游天然气销售企业此次将会把基础门站价下调多少？截止发稿时，三家企业均未回应《财经》记者提出的问题。
At the time of writing, none of the three upstream gas sales companies had responded to Caijing's questions.
此前各地已发布的降价幅度，是否还会再上游降价后进一步加大？目前暂无定论。
Before the local issued price reductions, whether there will be further upstream price reduction after further increase?
“我们保持合适的价差就行。
"We just have to keep the price differential.
下一步的调价幅度还要等政府通知。
The next step is to be announced by the government.
”此前已经按地方政府要求降价的某城市燃气公司人士对《财经》记者说到。
A city gas company that had previously cut prices at the request of the local government told Caijing.
国家发改委发布的通知里虽然没明确指出降气价的幅度，但多家媒体发布的新闻稿称，预计可降低企业用电、用气成本630亿元以上。
Although the notice issued by the National Development and Reform Commission did not specify the scope of the price cut, a number of media releases said that companies are expected to reduce the cost of electricity and gas consumption of more than 63 billion yuan.
按照两大电网公司公布的减免595亿元电费计算，天然气销售企业降低的气价成本在30亿元以上。
Based on the 59.5 billion yuan in electricity cuts announced by the two power grid companies, the cost of natural gas sales fell by more than 3 billion yuan.
降价成本如何分担在基准门站价的基础上，非居民用气的价格还包括管输费和配气费。
How to Share the Cost of Price Reduction On the basis of benchmark prices, the price of non-resident gas also includes the cost of pipelines and distribution.
基准门站价的调整主要针对三大上游天然气销售企业，管输费和配气费对应的是中游的管网公司和下游的分销商。
The adjustment of base station price is mainly aimed at the three upstream natural gas sales enterprises. Pipeline and gas distribution fees correspond to middle-stream pipeline companies and downstream distributors.
基准门站价占天然气零售价的比重往往在50%以上，管输费和配气费相对占比较小。
The proportion of base station price in the retail price of natural gas is usually more than 50%, and the cost of pipeline and gas distribution is relatively small.
多位城市燃气公司人士对《财经》记者表示，会按照上游企业的降价幅度相应下调气价。
A number of city gas companies told Caijing that they would cut gas prices in line with the price reduction for upstream companies.
但很难在上游降价的基础上再进一步下调气价了。
But it is difficult to cut prices upstream on the basis of a further reduction in gas prices.
国家发改委对于天然气中下游企业降气价的意见是非强制的。
The National Development and Reform Commission's opinions on the lower and middle reaches of natural gas prices are optional.
上述通知指出，各地价格主管部门要高度重视，抓紧工作，根据上游企业降价情况，及时降低非居民用气终端销售价格，切实将门站环节降价空间全部传导至终端用户。
According to the circular, price departments everywhere should attach great importance to their work, promptly reduce the price of non-resident end-use gas in line with the price reduction in upstream enterprises, and effectively transmit all the price reduction spaces at the gates to the end-users.
鼓励各地通过加强省内管道运输和配气价格监管等方式，进一步降低天然气终端销售价格，释放更多降价红利。
All localities are encouraged to further reduce the price of natural gas terminals and release more discounted dividends by, inter alia, strengthening supervision of the transportation of pipelines and the pricing of gas in the province.
对于上述通知内容，清燃智库首席信息官黄庆对《财经》记者解读称，上游企业是承担此次降气价的主力，中下游企业的管输费和配气费也有下调的空间。
Huangqing, chief information officer of the Qingming think tank, told Caijing that upstream companies were the main ones to bear the cost of the reduction, and that there was room for downwards and downwards.
但下游的城市燃气公司有一定的经营压力，降价难度较大。
However, the downstream urban gas companies have certain operating pressure, price reduction is more difficult.
不愿具名的某城市燃气公司人士对《财经》记者分析说，2017-2019年，所有城市燃气企业的配气业务板块平均资产回报率已从9.4%，降至6.8%。
An analysis by a city gas company not wishing to be named told Caijing that the average asset return for the gas distribution sector for all urban gas companies has fallen from 9.4 per cent to 6.8 per cent between 2017 and 2019.
如果此次还要求城市燃气企业降价，必须要有充足的原因。
If the city gas companies are also required to reduce prices this time, there must be sufficient reasons.
而配气价一旦降了，后期就很难涨回来了。
And once the price of gas fell, later on it is very difficult to come back.
另一位城市燃气公司人士则对《财经》记者说，政府对配气价格调整一般要经过监管程序，往往需要一两个星期才能完成调价。
Another Caijing source told Caijing that the government generally has to go through a regulatory process to adjust gas prices, which often takes a week or two to complete.
这不是马上就能改变的事情。
This is not something that can be changed immediately.
不管上下游如何分担降价成本，中石油无疑将是付出最大成本的企业。
Regardless of how the costs are shared upstream and downstream, PetroChina will undoubtedly be the company that pays the most.
中石油销售天然气量占全国消费量比重超过80%，2019年上半年，该公司天然气与管道板块实现经营利润人民币 183.02亿元。
PetroChina, which sells more than 80% of the country's natural gas, reported operating profits of 18.302 billion yuan in the first half of 2019.
以前文提及的降气价30亿元以上来看，对中石油的经营业绩影响不小。
The above-mentioned 3 billion yuan price reduction has had a significant impact on PetroChina's operating performance.
中石油集团某中层人士对《财经》记者表示，大难之际，中石油会坚决执行降价政策。
A middle-level CNPC source told Caijing that PetroChina would resolutely implement a price reduction policy in the wake of the disaster.
只是希望国资委考核时给予相关剔除、不要打击中石油员工的积极性。
Only hope SASAC when the assessment to give relevant cull, do not hit the enthusiasm of Chinese oil staff.
也希望国家发改委在制定改革意见时，要考虑能源央企担负多重目标多重责任的现实。
We also hope that the National Development and Reform Commission will take into account the reality that energy enterprises have multiple objectives and multiple responsibilities when formulating reform proposals.
