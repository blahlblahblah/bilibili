本报记者 王迎春 武汉报道除夕的武汉，耳畔热烈的鞭炮声、门楣新贴的大红春联亦不能赶走紧张氛围。
Our reporter Wang Yingchun Wuhan reported the New Year's Eve Wuhan, ear-side firecrackers, lintel newly posted red couplets can not remove tension.
朋友圈再难看到红包雨，恭喜发财被口罩问候取代。
Friends circle again difficult to see the red envelopes rain, happy to be replaced by mask greetings.
远方亲切的问候者，得知前往武汉过年的旧识新友将离汉、不日返城，瞬间沉默。
Dear greetings from afar, learned that Wuhan New Year's Eve old friends will leave Han, a few days back to the city, momentarily silent.
此刻，一分一秒比疫情更显压抑。
At the moment, every second is more depressing than the epidemic.
民间的沉默是不串门、不拜年、不见面、不接触，全国其他一些地方政府的反应需以“强烈”来形容，发布告市民书，层层传达，逐一查问身份描述有“武汉”字样的个人，一些地方针对这些“武汉”人明确要求不管有无症状，必须在家隔离，天数亦精确规定。
The silence of the people is not to visit the door, do not visit the New Year, do not meet, do not contact, some other local governments in the country to issue a "strong" version of the response, issued to the public, layer by layer, the identity of the individuals described as "Wuhan," some places expressly request that regardless of symptoms, must be isolated at home, the number of days is precisely defined.
所有人都在寻觅安全地带，安坐家中的人内心却在逃离。
All are looking for safety, while those who sit at home are fleeing.
生存本能占据绝对优势时，“他人即地狱”这种存在论调竟在新年的祝福声里生效了！这一点恐怕是出武汉城的人们想不到的。
When the survival instinct takes over, the existence of "others is hell" comes into effect at the sound of the New Year's greetings, which is perhaps unheard of in Wuhan city.
“过年不回家，还过什么年呢？”食堂大厨刘师傅近几天来竟成为名人。
"The New Year does not go home, what year still?" Cafeteria chef Liu Shifu has become a celebrity in recent days.
同事们谈到疫情话题总不能忘记提到他，“跑得真快！”刘师傅，重庆万州人，在武汉一家二级综合民营医院工作，由于老板是重庆人，老乡带老乡，自医院开办，刘师傅就跟着老板来汉工作，至今近8年。
When colleagues talk about the epidemic situation, they can't forget to mention him, "How fast!" Liu Shifu, a native of Wanzhou, Chongqing, worked in a second-class private hospital in Wuhan.
一周前，刘师傅已订好回万州的火车票，时间恰好是1月23日，不过是下午。
A week ago, Mr. Liu had booked a train ticket back to Wanzhou. It happened to be January 23, but it was afternoon.
这一天，武汉出了那道全国闻名的封城令，生效时间上午10点。
On this day, Wuhan out of the famous nationwide closure order, effective 10: 00 a.m.
不过，刘师傅还是在23日这一天回到老家，他到得甚至比预定的还要早。
However, Master Liu returned to his hometown on the 23rd. He arrived even earlier than scheduled.
由于早起习惯，凌晨5点他注意到这条信息，紧急打包，第一次坐了他从来舍不得坐的出租车，前往武汉客运中心，此时，大巴还能发车，10点大限来临时，刘师傅已经出城。
Due to his habit of getting up early, he noticed the message at 5 a.m., packed up and took the taxi he had never been willing to take to Wuhan Passenger Terminal Center for the first time.
那一天，着急出武汉者何止于刘师傅，有人不甘心回家的路被堵，有人担心自己的安全。
On that day, anxious out of Wuhan He stopped at Liu Shifu, some people are not willing to go home the road was blocked, some people worry about their own safety.

“我请亲戚送我到咸宁，然后转火车”。
I asked my relatives to take me to Xianning and then transfer the train.
车至咸宁高速入口，已有专门人员前来测量体温，此时，时间指向23日上午9点19分。

胡女士正常通过，以咸宁为起点，转了两列火车，终于回到深圳。
Ms. Hu passed normally, took Xianning as the starting point, turned two trains, and finally returned to Shenzhen.
“回老家窝了一个星期，哪儿都没去，现在年饭没吃，又折腾往外跑，心累！”她感叹。
"Home nest for a week, nowhere to go, now the New Year dinner did not eat, and toss out to run, tired!" she sighed.
心累的何止于胡女士，记者从采访中了解到，23日上午，武汉一批回汉的人们还没有来得及好好与亲友团聚，在突发消息公布后，担心年后无法回到居住地正常工作，通过私家车，走城际公路、高速，通过附近城市辗转逃离。
The reporter learned from the interview that 23 morning, Wuhan, a group of Hui Han people have not been able to get together with friends and relatives, after the announcement of the unexpected news, fear that they will not be able to return to their normal place of residence to work, through private cars, by intercity highways, high-speed, through nearby cities.
那些早就因偶然因素提前离开，或者身在外地计划于23日以后回汉探亲的人竟成为幸运者。
Those who had already left early due to accidental factors, or who had been away from home to visit their relatives in Han after the 23rd day, should have been lucky.
于22日离开武汉前往内蒙古婆家的王女士一直认为疫情是比较遥远的事情，直至飞机落地那一刻，有工作人员对来自武汉的旅客逐一测量体温。
Ms. Wang, who left Wuhan on May 22 for her mother-in-law's home in Inner Mongolia, said the outbreak was remote until the moment the plane landed.
因为人已在湖北省外，她尚不觉得此事有多么严重。
Because people were outside Hubei province, she didn't think it was serious enough.
已经买好回武汉机票的喻女士，在向多位朋友询问意见后，决定退票。
Ms. Yu, who had bought a ticket back to Wuhan, decided to refund the ticket after asking many friends for their opinions.
喻女士婚后长年住在天津，为了这次回汉探亲她准备了许久，并提前用快递把一些日用物品寄到武汉。
After a long marriage in Tianjin, Ms. Yu prepared a long time for her return to China and sent some daily necessities to Wuhan by express.
不过，还是有人走不了。

23日，记者采访发现，汉口火车站广场到处是想离站的旅客和正在宰客的私车师傅。
23, reporters found that Hankou station plaza is full of passengers who want to leave the station and the private car master is slaughter.
一位从湖北枣阳出发，路过武汉准备去广州的旅客一直与私车师傅周旋。
A traveler from Zaoyang, Hubei Province, passing through Wuhan to go to Guangzhou has been working with the private car master.
谈来谈去，他们谈到一个双方都能接受的出城目的地——岳阳，不过师傅在1000元车费这个高价上一直不让步。
They talked about a mutually acceptable destination, Yueyang, but Shifu never budged on the high price of $1,000.
一位实在不能接受宰客的年轻人通过APP等来了货车，其实他的目的地很近，就是武汉市金银湖。
A young man who could not accept the slaughter came to the truck through APP. In fact, his destination was near, namely, Wuhan Gold and Silver Lake.

“过年不回家，还过什么年呢？”他坐上拼来的私车，对记者说。

“都走了，谁干活呢？都得过年”武汉自2019年12月31日起披露疫情进展，关于疫情医学上的准确描述，借由国内专家们的共同努力在数天之内攻破。
Wuhan has been disclosing the progress of the epidemic since December 31, 2019, and the accurate medical description of the epidemic was broken down within a few days by the joint efforts of domestic experts.
