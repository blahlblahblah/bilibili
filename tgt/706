边境线上测体温、每天接诊40余囚犯：疫情不耽误我上班。
Border line temperature measurement, daily treatment of more than 40 prisoners: the epidemic does not delay my work.

大家好，我是田静。
Hello, everyone. I'm Tian Jing.
按照规定，今天已经是春节后第三个工作日了，我依旧待在家里处理工作。
According to the regulations, today is the third working day after the Spring Festival, I still stay at home to work.
我以为很多人会和我一样，但事实却是：很多人冒着风险走出家门，回到自己的工作岗位。
I thought a lot of people would be like me, but the truth is: a lot of people go out at risk and go back to their jobs.
离疫情中心千里远中越边境，张扬过了四个关卡才回到单位。
From the center of the epidemic thousands of miles across the border, Zhang Yang after four checkpoints before returning to work.
这里不像大家想象的国界，铁丝网密布，边防军人把守。
This place is not like everyone imagined, the barbed wire fence, border guards guarded.
而是中越两国热闹的边贸互市。
It is the lively border trade between China and Vietnam.
要是往年，张阳此时可能正在水泄不通的市场里，听越南小贩柔软的吆喝，品尝美味的越南小吃，尽情选购物美价廉的异国特产。
If this year, Zhang Yang may be in a crowded market, listening to Vietnamese vendors soft yelling, taste delicious Vietnamese snacks, indulge in the purchase of cheap exotic products.
今年疫情一来，如临大敌，互市关停里，基层工作人员和边防警察都派驻到公路上，设点堵卡。
This year's outbreak, such as the enemy, the closure of the mutual market, grass-roots staff and border police are stationed on the road, put a checkpoint.
还有一位主动申请返回岗位的医生，她的病人是监狱的罪犯。
There was also a doctor who volunteered to return to work and whose patient was a prisoner in a prison.
大家都说目前监狱才是最安全的地方。
People say that prisons are the safest place to be right now.
但因为疫情，她现在一天要给40多个犯人看诊，每一个犯人体温上升，都会比平时紧张。
But because of the outbreak, she now visits more than 40 prisoners a day, and every inmate has a warmer temperature than usual.
她说：“要在战略上藐视敌人，战术上重视敌人。
"Strategically despise the enemy and tactically value the enemy," she said.
”疫情影响到各行各业，金融行业耶不能幸免，证券公司的袁莉，看着新年开市的电子屏幕：都是一片绿，啥时候可以一片红？隔着屏幕，我似乎在这句话里，看到了她水灵灵的眼睛，古灵精怪而又充满哀伤。
Yuan Li of the securities firm looked at the electronic screen at the start of the new year, when it was all green, when could it be red? Through the screen, I seemed to see her bright eyes, quaint and sad.
遇到灾难时，这些坚守在自己的岗位上的平凡个体，才是我们的希望。
When faced with disasters, these adhere to their posts on the ordinary individuals, is our hope.
正如张阳说：“立春了，会好的！”中越边境▌卡点重重，钓鱼村民被困野外三天全球化时代，人口流动的速度和强度前所未有，中越边境的偏远小镇也不会坐以待毙。
The border between China and Vietnam is fraught with quagmire, fishing villagers are trapped in a three-day era of globalization, population movements are unprecedented in speed and intensity, and remote towns along the China-Vietnam border will not sit idly by.
上班前一天，张阳开着自己的红色小轿车，从云南省文山壮族自治州的州府往南走，经过四个关卡，终于到达中越边境。
The day before work, Zhang Yang drove his small red car southward from the capital of Wenshan Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province.
“往小路走了十多公里被拦住了，又折回去走大路，每个关卡都要测量体温、登记车辆和个人信息，包括住所和工作地。
"After walking more than 10 kilometres down the road, he turned back to the main road, where he took temperature measurements, registered vehicles and personal information, including his place of residence and work.
”几年前通过事业单位考试，张阳进入了文山州某镇的农业综合服务中心。
"A few years ago, Zhang entered an agricultural comprehensive service center in a town in Wenshan by passing an institutional exam.
去年底在州府买了房、结了婚，“算是一辈子留在这里了。
He bought a house in the state capital and got married at the end of last year.
”在疫情防控的基层一线，没有延迟上班的说法。
At the grass-roots level, there is no talk of delaying work.
张阳的单位所在地虽然是一个镇，但辖区面积却并不小。
Although Zhang Yang's unit location is a town, but the area of jurisdiction is not small.
镇辖区的中越边境线有108公里长，共有18个村委会（社区），其中6个村委会与越南接壤。
There are 18 village committees (communities) along the 108-kilometre border with Viet Nam, 6 of which border Viet Nam.
为了促进两国交流，政府在这里设置了5个边民互市点。
To facilitate exchanges between the two countries, the government has set up five border-crossing points.
赶集日，边民互市点就成了当地人与越南人商贸往来的绝佳之地，热闹非凡。
On Market Day, the border exchange became an excellent place for locals to do business with Vietnamese, and it was hugely popular.
如今受疫情影响，边民互市点全部关闭，两国人民都被挡在了各自的国境线内。
Now affected by the epidemic, border crossings have been closed, and both peoples have been kept within their respective borders.
镇上的集市也关闭了，只留下一个菜市场、一家宾馆和两家超市。
The town fair was also closed, leaving behind a vegetable market, a hotel and two supermarkets.
“菜市场每天都要消毒，宾馆给发热的人隔离用，进超市必须戴口罩、量体温，尽量线上支付。
"Hallucinogen market to disinfect every day, the hotel to the feverish people for isolation, into the supermarket must wear masks, temperature, as much as possible online payment.
”疫情打乱了平日的工作状态，基层工作者全部归队，投入到抗击疫情的工作中。
The outbreak disrupted normal working conditions, with grass-roots workers returning to the team to fight the epidemic.
张阳同事们都在镇与镇、村与村之间设卡，防止人员流动，影响疫情防控。
Zhang Yang colleagues in towns and towns, villages and villages set up barriers to prevent the movement of people, affect disease prevention and control.
“一些卡点24小时四班倒，有的24小时三班倒。
"Some of the checkpoints run four shifts a day, some run three shifts a day.
”卡点工作人员包括政府职工、医生护士和派出所民警，在国境线上，还有边防警察。
Staff at the checkpoint included government employees, doctors, nurses and police officers at police stations, as well as border police along the border.
“政府、医院和派出所的人集中在一起，组成了4个小分队，各村组织了18个小分队轮流值班。
"People from the government, hospitals and police stations came together in four teams, and 18 teams from each village took turns.
”每个工作人员每天上午和下午都要测量体温。
"Each worker had their body temperature taken every morning and afternoon.
设卡点带来许多无奈，但这是当前疫情防控最有效的方式之一。
Checking points bring a lot of helplessness, but this is currently one of the most effective way of epidemic prevention and control.
刚开始堵卡那天，另外一个县的村民到河边钓鱼，结果被拦在了两个卡点中间，在野外待了三天时间。
At the beginning of the day, villagers from another county went fishing by the river, only to be stopped in the middle of two checkpoints and spent three days in the wild.
好在卡点工作人员换班时发现了他们，顺道用车护送他们离开辖区。
Fortunately, the checkpoint staff found them on shift and stopped by to escort them out of the district.
还有的连同房车，一起滞留在山上。
Others, along with their carts, were stranded on the mountains.
铁栏杆横亘在道路上，除了急救车辆、应急车辆和运送物资的车辆无人可以逾越。
The railing spans the road and no one can cross except emergency vehicles, emergency vehicles and vehicles carrying supplies.
对于堵卡，每个人都有自己的立场，从国家层面来讲这是当前疫情防控最有效的方式，从村民角度来看这给生活带来极大不便。
As for the blockage, everyone has their own standpoint, which is the most effective way to prevent and control the epidemic at the national level, which brings great inconvenience to life from the point of view of the villagers.
边疆少数民族地区的疫情防控与内地不一样，语言不通、文凭不高、安全意识差——这似乎是中国所有偏远农村的现状——随之而来的是争吵和无奈。
Unlike the hinterland, ethnic-minority areas in border areas have poor language skills, low diplomas, and poor safety awareness - as seems to be the case in all the remote rural areas of China - followed by bickering and helplessness.
村民没有条件，防疫小分队要派人到村里挨家挨户测量体温，每天2—3次，如果体温超过37.3度，医生便到家检测是否感染。
Villagers did not have the conditions, vaccination teams to send people to the village house-to-house temperature measurement, two to three times a day, if the temperature exceeds 37.3 degrees, the doctor will come home to check for infection.
2月2日到了单位，张阳领到了防护口罩，但并没有被安排参加堵卡——他有感冒症状，因此在办公室处理日常工作。
February 2 to the work unit, Zhang Yang received a face mask, but was not arranged to participate in the card - he has cold symptoms, so the office handling routine work.
2月3日，文山州首例确诊，这位患者曾到过张阳常去的菜市场。
On February 3, Wenshan state, the first case confirmed, this patient has been to Zhang Yang frequented the vegetable market.
张阳不得不把自己的情况“及时上报”。
Zhang Yang had to "report" his situation in time.
单位要求全部工作人员戴口罩，但现在防护物资依旧紧张。
All staff are required to wear face masks, but protection materials are still tight.
“物资会解决的。
"The supplies will work out.
“”立春了，会好的！”张阳说。
The spring will be fine, said Zhang Yang.
文艺工作者▌两次改签机票有人咳嗽都会心慌2月3日，海天起得很早，收拾打扮后，骑上电动车去了单位——因为地铁公交已经停运——她是匆匆改签机票赶回来上班的。
February 3, the sky rose very early, dressed up, riding an electric car to work - because the subway bus has stopped - she hastily re-signed tickets back to work.
自春节放假，海天一直在纠结要不要回家看望父母。
Since the Spring Festival holiday, the sky has been entangled whether to go home to see their parents.
一年不回家，心里总是挂念着远隔千里的父母，但每天增长疫情数据令海天唏嘘。
A year did not go home, the heart always worried about thousands of miles away parents, but every day the growth of epidemic data makes the sea sob.
思前想后，最终海天还是选择回家。
After thinking about it, the sky finally chose to go home.
丈夫把她送到了城郊的高铁站，没有与之同去。
Her husband took her to a high-speed rail station on the outskirts of town, not with her.
此时已是1月26日，正月初二，全国多地早已启动了一级响应。
At this point is January 26, the second day of the first month, many parts of the country has already launched a response.
好在除了湖北以外，还没有多少省份封路，列车也正常运行。
Fortunately, in addition to Hubei, there are not many provinces blocked roads, the train is also normal operation.
“动车上的乘客基本都带了口罩，火车站的人也比平时少了许多，还有工作人员测量体温。
"Most of the passengers on the train were wearing masks and there were far fewer people at the train station than usual," he said.
”父母开车到火车站，用酒精喷雾喷了个遍，才让海天上车。
"My parents drove to the station and sprayed it all over with alcohol before getting on the train.
海天是一名文艺工作者，平时演出任务重，基本没有节假日。
Haitian is a literary and art worker, usually performing heavy tasks, basically no holidays.
当大部分人“五一”和“十一”出去旅游、逛街的时候，他们依旧需要参加各种演出。
When most people go out traveling and shopping on May Day and National Day, they still need to take part in various performances.
综合考虑之下，单位1月中旬获批后下发通知：春节假期从1月23日到2月10日。
Taken together, the unit was approved in mid-January and issued a notice: Spring Festival from January 23 to February 10.
世间诸多事情似乎都是巧合。
Many things in the world seem to be coincidences.
1月29日，海天单位所在地的省委省政府下发通告，除特殊行业，其他企事业不早于2月9日24时前复工。
On 29 January, the provincial government of the province where the Haitian unit is located issued a circular stating that other enterprises, with the exception of special industries, would resume work no earlier than 2400 hours before 9 February.
后来，有人拿海天打趣：“你们单位是不是提前知道疫情信息？”海天买好了2月9日的回程机票，计划10日上班。
Later, someone took the sea day fun: "Do your unit know the epidemic information in advance?" Sea sky bought February 9 return tickets, planning to work on the 10th.
不过，生活似乎经不起规划，尤其在这样的特殊时期，人不得不被疫情牵着鼻子走。
However, life seems to be unable to withstand planning, especially in such special times, people have to be led by the epidemic.
两天后，单位给海天打来的电话：2月3日提前上班，要她改签机票按时到单位。
Two days later, the unit to the sea call: February 3 ahead of time to work, to change her ticket to work on time.
作为文艺工作者，提前上班似乎没有太大必要。
As a literary and art worker, it doesn't seem necessary to go to work early.
但作为省厅的下属机关，与海天单位同级的其他单位2月3日正常上班。
However, as a subordinate organ of a province or department, other units at the same level as sea and sky units normally enter work on February 3.
很多时候，人们看得见别人清闲，却看不见别人付出，两相比较后总会觉得不公。
Most of the time, people can see others leisure, but can not see others to pay, compared with the two will always feel unfair.
但很少有人明白，公平并不意味着把所有人当作同样的人来对待，而是不偏不倚地处理每一个人的独特处境。
But few understand that fairness does not mean treating all people as the same, but rather deals impartially with the unique situation of each individual.
总之，因为一些人的不满，海天单位不得不提前上班。
In short, because of the dissatisfaction of some people, the sea-sky units had to work early.
“那么多人都在上班，提前去也没有怨言，但是有些难受。
'So many people are at work, and there's no complaint about going early, but it's a bit hard.
”海天自费改签了机票，并且托朋友买了口罩。
Haitian changed his ticket at his own expense and asked a friend to buy a mask.
但疫情越来越严重，全国各地陆续开始封路，海天老家也没有幸免。
But the epidemic is getting worse, and roads are being closed across the country, including in Haitian.
万般无奈，她又重新把机票改签到道路通畅的机场。
In desperation, she re-signed the ticket to open the road to the airport.
2月2日出发那天，依旧是父母开车送她去机场，不同的是一路上被防疫工作人员两次拦下测量体温。
On Feb. 2, it was her parents who drove her to the airport, only to be stopped twice along the way by cordon sanitaire to take her temperature.
“飞机上所有人都是戴了口罩的，但是旁边一直有人咳嗽，心里还是很慌。
"Everyone on the plane was wearing masks, but someone had been coughing next to them and was still in a panic.
”2月3日早晨，新闻按时推送了疫情通报数据——全国新增确诊2829例，累计确诊17205例，疑似21558例。
On the morning of February 3, the news sent the epidemic data on schedule - 2,829 new cases were confirmed nationwide, with 17,205 confirmed cases and 21,558 suspected cases.
今年春节后的第一个工作日，阳光正好，但大街上空空荡荡，商铺紧闭，不见人的踪影。
On the first working day after the Spring Festival, the sun was shining just right, but the streets were empty, the shops were closed and no one was visible.
八点半，全体行政办公室的人都到单位了。
At 8: 30, all the people in the administration office are at work.
与以往不同的是，今年开工没有那么热闹。
Unlike in the past, work started this year has been less hectic.
“单位采用了轮班的方式，一人去一天。
"The unit uses a shift system, one person for a day.
”开完会，大部分人又回到了家里，只留下在办公室处理日常工作的值班人员。
When the meeting was over, most of the group returned home, leaving only the office workers on duty.
海天和同事们每人领到3个防护口罩。
Haitian and his colleagues each received three face masks.
“要求进单位就要戴口罩。
"Ask to enter the unit to wear a mask.
”其实在这样的时日里，单位并没有多少工作需要处理，原本十几个人的办公室里，只剩下四个人。
In fact, in these days, there was not much work to do, and there were only four people left in the office of a dozen or so people.
对海天来说，在办公室和在家里没有区别，只不过是换了一个地方隔离——依旧无聊。
For the sky, there is no difference between being in the office and being at home, just changing places to be isolated - and still boring.
干完第一天，她又将休息一天，然后再去值班。
On the first day, she will have another day off before she goes on duty.
证券工作者▌对我最大的影响不是出门，而是股票大跌与海天不同，袁莉是主动回来上班的。
The biggest impact of securities workers to me is not to go out, but the stock market plummeted and different from the sky, Yuan Li is the initiative to return to work.
作为一名证券行业的从业者，每年春节后的第一个交易日意义特殊——股民都想图个开门红，一般情况下也都会如此。
As a trader in the securities industry, the first trading day after Spring Festival each year is special - investors want to hit the jackpot, as is often the case.
但受疫情影响，今年的情况刚好相反——“千股跌停”。
But affected by the epidemic, this year the situation is just the opposite - "1000 shares limit."
2月3日，A股开盘，上证大幅低开8.42%，超3000家个股跌停，创近23年记录……不过，这些都在意料之中。
On Feb. 3, A shares opened, with the Shanghai stock down 8.42%, surpassing the 23-year record by 8.42%.
不仅对袁莉这样的金融从业者来说如此，对每一个股民来说也毫不意外。
Not only for financial practitioners like Yuan Li, but also for everyone.
袁莉是公司的业务员，主要工作是给客户推荐理财产品、做些理财配置。
Yuan Li is the company's sales staff, the main work is to recommend financial management products to customers, some financial configuration.
从四川老家来到云南工作已经七八年了，袁莉在昆明买了房、成了家，似乎成了一个云南人。
It has been seven or eight years since she came to Yunnan to work from her hometown in Sichuan. Yuan Li bought a house in Kunming and became a family.
1月22日，新型冠状病毒肺炎已经成为媒体头条，放假后的袁莉从昆明飞到四川老家。
January 22, the new coronavirus pneumonia has become the media headlines, after the holiday from Kunming Yuan Li flew to his hometown in Sichuan.
“那时候昆明一个疑似病例，老家还一个都没有，路上也没人戴口罩。
"There was a suspected case in Kunming back home, and no one was wearing a mask on the road.
”疫情之下，对病毒的恐惧慢慢变成了对未知的恐慌，身体出现的一切变化都会令人心惊胆战。
With the outbreak, fear of the virus slowly becomes fear of the unknown, and any change in the body can be frightening.
“回去就感冒，立马去医院，医生说没啥就让回来吃药。
"Go back to the cold, immediately to the hospital, the doctor said nothing to back to take medicine.
”大年三十过后，当地就发公告不让出门，袁莉老家通往成都双流国际机场的高速公路全部封闭。
Yuan Li's hometown to Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport was closed down on the expressway after the New Year's Eve.
不过，袁莉依旧想要回到工作岗位上，绕了很多路终于到了机场。
However, Yuan Li still wants to go back to work, a lot of roundabout way finally arrived at the airport.
“很多航班都因为疫情取消了，不过我的没有受到影响。
"A lot of flights have been cancelled because of the outbreak, but mine has not been affected.
”2月2日，她回到了昆明。
On February 2, she returned to Kunming.
和全国许多省份一样，云南省也为防控疫情发布了多条通告，其中一条专门针对企业复工和学校开学，要求企业不得早于2月9日上班。
As in many provinces, Yunnan province has issued several notices aimed at preventing and controlling the epidemic, including one aimed at reopening businesses and schools, which are required to start work no earlier than February 9.
在互联网时代，地理空间对工作的影响正变得越来越小。
In the age of the Internet, the influence of geospatial information on work is becoming smaller and smaller.
袁莉的公司要求部门主管尽量到岗，其他工作人员可以采取了线上办公的方式。
Yuan Li's company requires department heads to be as available, and other staff can work online.
公司在昆明市最繁华地段——南屏街，“停车费太贵”。
The company in Kunming's most prosperous area - Nanping Street, "parking fees too expensive."
公交系统停运之前，袁莉都是坐公共交通出行，但是现在，整座城市似乎都停了下来，她不得不开车上班。
Yuan used to travel by public transport before the bus system was shut down, but now the whole city seems to have stopped and she has to drive to work.
昆明的冬天还是一样的阳光明媚，气温保持在十多度。
Kunming winter is still the same bright sunshine, the temperature stays at more than 10 degrees.
但马路却没有拥堵，也没有焦躁的情绪，街灯依旧亮着，却不见昔日车水马龙。
But the road is not congested, there is no agitated mood, the street lights are still bright, but there was no traffic.
袁莉感觉到了几分寒意。
Yuan Li felt a bit chilly.
这段时间，公司统一解决午餐。
In the meantime, the company solves lunch uniformly.
到岗的人员进门时都要挨个消毒、量体温。
People arriving at the gate have to disinfect each other and take their temperature.
袁莉并非主管，按照公司的规定，不需要这么早到岗。
Yuan Li is not in charge, according to the company's rules, do not need to arrive at work so early.
“主要我懒，太多工作相关的东西都放在办公室了。
"I'm lazy. Too much work-related stuff is in the office.
还有是因为客户较多，有很多持仓。
Also because there are more customers, there are a lot of positions.
”这几天，她最紧要的是调止损，能降低损失的，就要降低。
The most important thing for her these days was to stop the loss, and to reduce it, to lower it.
“能卖的股票要卖了，不能卖的要做预判，降低损失。
"Stocks that can be sold should be sold, and those that cannot be sold should be pre-judged to reduce losses.
”“对我最大的影响不是出门，而是股票大跌。
"" The biggest impact on me was not going out, but a big stock sell-off.
”过去的2019年，“寒冬”成为了高频词汇——“影视寒冬”、“互联网寒冬”、“资本寒冬”……疫情爆发，股票大跌虽然在意料之中，但也免不了心生惆怅。
In 2019, "cold winter" has become a high-frequency vocabulary - "movie and television winter," "Internet cold winter," "capital winter"... The outbreak of the epidemic, and the stock market crash, though not unexpected, is bound to be disheartening.
“千股跌停”意味着客户的资金蒸发，或许藏在了股票里，但怎么也找不到了。
"Thousand shares limit" means that the customer's funds evaporate, perhaps hidden in the stock, but how can not find.
做金融的人都相信钱怎么走事件就怎么走，虽然有些片面，但也缓解了袁莉的恐慌。
The financiers believe that money goes the way of events. Although it is partial, it also alleviates Yuan Li's panic.
“经济数据都在转告长线是看好的，不过最近一月估计都会比较难，行情也一天一个样。
"The economic data are telling the long term that it's good, but it's going to be tough in January and the market is going from day to day."
”“看到了一片绿，啥时候可以一片红？”袁莉说，这是她今年第一个工作日唯一的想法。
"Seeing a piece of green, when can one be red?" Yuan Li said, her only thought for the first working day of the year.
“生活还是要继续，看天了。
"Life will go on, look at God.
”监狱医生▌提前返岗封闭值班 每天接诊40余罪犯众所周知，监狱是一个人口密集度很高的地点，一旦有疫情传入，后果不堪设想。
Prison doctor to return to work early closed duty daily to receive more than 40 criminals It is well known that the prison is a highly populated place, the consequences of an outbreak of disease are inconceivable.
因为疫情，云南昆明监狱要求部分人员提前返岗，作为监狱医院的一名医生，柳婷接到命令后，主动请缨要求值守，想让年长的同事多休息几日。
Because of the outbreak, Kunming Prison in Yunnan asked some of its staff to return home early. As a doctor at the prison hospital, Liu Ting had volunteered to take extra days off because she had chosen it.
明星们从热搜消失的日子里，医生成了主角。
From the day the stars disappeared, the doctor became the main character.
在这场和时间赛跑的疫情里，唯一能让大家安心的，可能只有“医生”二字。
In this race against time, the only thing that will reassure everyone is probably the word "doctor."
疫情开始时，监狱就停止了罪犯和亲友间的会见。
When the outbreak began, the prison ceased to meet with relatives and friends.
监管区门口设立了体温监测点，每一个进入监管区的人员，都要进行体温监测。
Thermal monitoring stations have been set up outside the prison area and every person entering the prison area is monitored for body temperature.
柳婷按照要求检测完，就转身投入到工作中去了。
Liu Ting in accordance with the requirements of the test, then turned into the work.
作为双警家庭，柳婷丈夫也在单位值守，原本热热闹闹的家一下只剩父母。
As a double-police family, Liu Ting husband also in the unit watch, the original hot home only parents.
大过年的，不能陪伴在父母身边，做女儿的心里当然很愧疚。
Big New Year, can not accompany in the parents side, to be the daughter's heart of course very guilty.
好在父亲很支持她的决定，值守期间，还特别给她捎来一张纸条，上面写着：“柳婷吾儿：见字如面，你能在困难面前挺身而出，足以证明你没有辜负爸爸对你的教诲，你要时刻以一名合格的党员要求，不负监狱重托。
Her father was very supportive of her decision, and during her tour of duty he sent her a message which said, "Tingwu: You can stand up to difficulties and prove that you have lived up to what your father taught you. You must always be a qualified member of the Party and live up to the demands of prison
”舆论喜欢造神，尤其在迷茫和慌乱当下。
Public opinion likes to create gods, especially at a time of confusion and confusion.
其实，世上哪有什么白衣天使，不过都是父母眼里的孩子，子女眼里的父母。
In fact, there are no angels in the world, but are the eyes of the parents of children's parents.
虽然父母都理解，也支持，但是自己心里总是觉得亏欠他们，等打赢这场疫情防控阻击战，柳婷准备一家再吃顿热闹的团圆饭。
Although both parents understand and support, but their hearts always feel that they owe them, until win this disease prevention and control battle, Liu Ting prepared the family to eat a lively reunion dinner.
由于天气变化，感冒病犯剧增，自封闭值班以来，柳婷每天平均接诊病犯40余名。
Due to the weather changes, cold patients increased sharply, since the closure of the duty, Liu Ting daily average of more than 40 patients.
尽管病犯和外界一直是严密隔离，也没有武汉相关接触史，但柳婷还是要一一仔细询问发热病犯的身体情况。
Although the patient and the outside world has been closely isolated, there is no Wuhan-related contact history, but Liu Ting or carefully inquire about the febrile patient's physical condition.
“哪里不舒服？”、 “有什么症状？有没有出现四肢酸痛乏力？”、“先量下体温……”这些话，每天要说上几十次。
"Where is uncomfortable?", "What symptom is there? Have appeared the extremity ache is weak?", "Take a temperature first..." These words, say a few dozen times a day.
问她每天接待这么多发热病人怕不怕？她笑着回答：战略上藐视敌人，战术上重视敌人。
Asking her to treat so many febrile patients every day, she replied with a smile: strategic defiance of the enemy, tactical attention to the enemy.
虽然疫情被严防死守在监狱高墙之外，但值守期间，也遇到一些比较紧急的情况，比如一个罪犯突然腹部剧烈疼痛，需要进行急诊。
Although the outbreak was kept out of the prison walls, the duty period was marked by more urgent situations, such as a sudden severe abdominal pain and the need for an emergency medical intervention.
医院全体迅速做好接诊准备，病犯送到后，通过B超、X光检查，医生进行了会诊，初诊为疑似空腔脏器穿孔或肠套叠可能，有生命危险！在中心医院的指导下，大家齐心协力完成应急处置，凌晨3点罪犯情况才稍有好转，而院长守了整整一夜。
After the patient arrived, the doctor had a consultation with the doctor. The patient was first diagnosed with a suspected perforation of the hollow viscera or intussusception. Under the guidance of the Central Hospital, we all made concerted efforts to complete the emergency treatment.
还有一名罪犯高血压突发疾病，送至医院时已意识混乱，因血压过高，有脑出血或脑梗可能，医院抢救后也不具备救治条件，同事们只能连夜送至中心医院住院。
There was also a prisoner with hypertension who arrived at the hospital with a confused mind, high blood pressure, cerebral hemorrhage or cerebral infarction, and no medical treatment was available after the hospital rescue. The colleagues had to be hospitalized overnight at the central hospital.
这些都是监狱医院里，医务人员的日常工作。
These are the daily work of the medical staff at the prison hospital.
也许有人会问，为什么要待在这种医院，没有钱，也很难拥有名誉。
One might ask why one should stay in such a hospital, without money, and with little reputation.
纪录片《手术两百年》里就说：医学是人类善良情感的一种表达，它起源于人类最朴素的救助愿望。
The documentary "Two Centenary of Surgery" says: Medicine is an expression of humanity's benevolent emotion, which originates from man's simplest desire to save.
医生的眼里只有病患，没有职业身份，高低贵贱。
The eyes of doctors are only patients, no professional status, high and low.
