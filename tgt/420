”作者 | 第一财经刘佳清晨6点的武汉，天还没亮，身穿黄色防护服、戴好口罩和护目镜的网约车司机别华容已经开着车行驶在路上了。
Wuhan, with its yellow suit, face mask and goggles, is still in the dark at 6 a. m. at Wuhan, the first financial services company.
他负责接一位武汉协和医院的医生上班。
He is in charge of a doctor at Wuhan Concorde Hospital.
把医生送到后，戴着口罩的医生和他拍照留念，还要加他微信发红包祝福新年好，别师傅婉拒了他。
When the doctor arrives, the doctor in the mask will take a picture of him and send him a red envelope.
“他们是最辛苦，压力最大的。
"They're the hardest, the most stressful.
还有（医生）送我们口罩、消毒喷雾的，谢谢他们为武汉做的一切。
There are (doctors) to send us masks, disinfectant spray, thank them for doing everything for Wuhan.
”别师傅说。
"said the master.
别师傅所在的车队有20多人。
Don't be in a convoy of more than 20.
他说，只要有出行需求，都抢着上，如果有忙不过来的，或者谁距离需要接送人近的，只要说一声都立马有人会帮忙。
He said that as long as there is a need to travel, are scrambling, if there is busy, or who needs to close the distance, just say that someone will immediately help.
忙不过来时，有人连早餐都没吃一直工作到下午，随便吃点继续工作，尽最大的能力多接送医护人员。
When busy, some people did not even eat breakfast until the afternoon, casually eat to continue to work, try to do their best to transport health-care workers.
每天根据调度安排接送医护工作者上“前线”，中午随便对付一口，下午继续接送， 像别师傅这样的网约车司机还有不少。
Every day according to the scheduling arrangements to transport health-care workers to the "front line," a casual midday deal with a continued afternoon, such as the master of the network car driver there are many.
此前，应武汉市新冠肺炎防控指挥部要求，1月24日12时起，滴滴出行暂停武汉网约车运营。
Previously, at the request of Wuhan Xinguan Pneumonia Control Command, January 24 since 12: 00, drip travel suspension Wuhan net contract car operation.
一天后，在向武汉有关部门报备后，滴滴宣布组建首批100名司机组成的医护保障车队，统一接受武汉相关部门的集中调度，在尽力保障司机自身安全的前提下，从25日凌晨开始，为武汉各医院医务工作者提供免费出行服务。
A day later, after submitting the report to Wuhan authorities, drip-drop announced the formation of the first 100 drivers of the medical care convoy, unified under the relevant Wuhan departments, while doing their best to ensure their own safety, from the early morning of 25, Wuhan hospitals to provide free travel services.
相关工作人员告诉第一财经记者，车队的所有司机要做好充足的防护工作后才能上岗，为此滴滴专门给司机配发了防护服、口罩、护目镜和消毒液，考虑到可能春节司机可能会不能正常用餐，还准备了泡面和矿泉水。
The first financial reporter was told that all drivers of the motorcade should not take up their duties until they have done enough protection. Drivers were given protective clothing, face masks, goggles and disinfectant, and noodles and mineral water were prepared in anticipation of the possibility that Spring Festival drivers might not be able to eat normally.
司机们在回家前，要按照要求处理使用过的防护服和口罩，回家第一件事就是洗手消毒。
Drivers are required to dispose of used protective clothing and masks before returning home, the first thing is to wash hands and disinfect them.
和别师傅工作类似，武汉医护保障车队的杨俊师傅主要负责武汉市中心医院医护人员的接送。
Similar to other teachers, Master Yang Jun of Wuhan Medical Care and Guarantee Team is mainly responsible for the transportation of medical staff in Wuhan Central Hospital.
按照杨俊原来的计划，在武汉过春节后，初四左右回老家走亲戚。
According to Yang Jun's original plan, in Wuhan after the Spring Festival, around the fourth back home relatives.
但这次突然遇到肺炎扩散严重的情况，他决定不回去了，“万一传染别人就是添乱”。
But this time, he decided not to go back in the case of severe pneumonia, "in case the spread of other people is to add chaos."
他说，自己在得到消息后一直守着手机，抢在第一时间报名接受保障车队任务。
He said he had been holding on to his cell phone since he got the news and signed up for the first-time convoy assignment.
至于为什么加入，没想太多，就是想做点自己能够做的事情，“专业的事情我不会，但是开车送人本来就是我每天的工作。
As for why I joined, I just wanted to do something I could do. "Professional things I don't, but giving people away by car is what I do every day.
”从25日起，杨俊开始正式接受调派。
Since 25, Mr Yeung has been officially seconded.
他说，接送任务很暖心，第一位医护人员突然问他贵姓的时候，没多想就说了。
He said that the delivery task was warm, the first medical personnel suddenly asked him your family name, do not think about it.
没想到，他的名字居然出现在医护人员的一条朋友圈里。
Unexpectedly, his name actually appeared in a medical staff in a circle of friends.
在接送了多单之后，杨俊的一个感受是，医护工作者非常专业，下车前都会自己携带酒精对自己接触到的车上所有地方喷洒消毒。
One of Yang's feelings, after picking up the tickets, was that health-care workers were very professional and would spray and disinfect all areas of their cars with alcohol before getting off the bus.
刚出任务时，杨俊说他的家人并不能完全理解，叮嘱的话语里略带抱怨，但他在出完任务回去后，和家人聊聊一天的经历和感受后，家人反倒是开始支持和理解。
When he left his job, Yang said his family did not fully understand the message and complained slightly, but when he returned from work to talk with his family about the day's experiences and feelings, his family began to support and understand.
但也有司机，选择没有告诉家人自己参加车队。
But there were also drivers who chose not to tell their families to join the convoy.
一位主要负责接送南京路中心医院医护人员的邵师傅说，是因为怕家人担心。
Shao Shifu, who was mainly responsible for taking the hospital staff to Nanjing Road Central Hospital, said he was afraid of his family.
“没想太多，就是希望能让城市尽快恢复秩序，大家回到正常生活，好好工作，好好生活。
"Not too much, just hope that the city can restore order as soon as possible, everyone back to normal life, good work, good life.
”他说，他的队友们都特别积极，“恨不得奉献出自己的每一分每一秒，让人感觉团结一致的力量真的非常好。
His teammates, he said, were particularly active. "I wish I could give every minute of my life to make people feel so united.
”除了接送医护人员外，为解决市民居家出行不便等问题，武汉市全市紧急征集6000台出租车，分配给中心城区。
In addition to transporting medical staff, the city of Wuhan has issued an emergency collection of 6,000 taxis for distribution to the central city to solve problems such as inconveniences in travelling around the home.
其中滴滴目前正召集1336名网约车司机，组建“社区保障车队”并交相关部门和社区居委会统一调度，为武汉各社区民众提供免费出行服务。
Droplets are now gathering 1,336 network contract drivers to form a "community security team" and submit to the relevant departments and community-based committees unified dispatch, to provide free travel services for Wuhan communities.
负责武汉市洪山区毛坦社区的保障车队毛师傅说，自己曾亲身经历过2003年非典时期的武汉，这次还是想为武汉尽一份力。
Mao Shifu, who is in charge of the Hongshan Maotan community in Wuhan, said he had experienced the SARS period in Wuhan in 2003 and wanted to do his part for Wuhan.
他的职责是保障毛坦社区必要的出行需求服务，目前社区情况比较平稳，有发热病人，但是社区组织了医疗救助小队。
His role is to ensure the necessary travel needs of the Mautan community, which is currently relatively stable and has febrile patients, but the community has organized medical assistance teams.
“能感觉到肩上的责任和压力，希望能够服务好大家。
"I feel the responsibility and pressure on my shoulders and I hope I can serve you well.
”在无数司机春节无休随时待命的背后，一位保障车队的司机说，自己的初衷很简单，“我生活在武汉，我热爱武汉。
"I live in Wuhan, and I love Wuhan," said one motorcade driver, who helped drive the motorcade during the Spring Festival.
只有城市健康了，我们居民才会有舒适的小日子。
Only when the city is healthy will our residents have comfortable little days.
