燃财经（ID:rancaijing）原创作者 | 唐亚华编辑 | 魏佳疫情横扫，线下零售业态一片萧条。
Flaming Finance (ID: Rancaijing) & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
快时尚连锁品牌名创优品在2月经历了关掉一半以上门店、收入下降95%的危局。
Fast-fashion chain brands experienced a 95% drop in revenue in February after closing more than half of its stores.
于是名创优品开始降薪、新增口罩类目、直播带货。
So the name of premium products began to reduce wages, new categories of masks, live delivery.
没想到，一系列的自救措施反而给公司带来了接二连三的麻烦。
Unexpectedly, a series of self-help measures to the company has brought a succession of trouble.
有用户投诉高价买到的口罩不合格、也有人吐槽直播中主播隔空骂网友、更有员工抗议降薪裁员，名创优品陷入了舆论漩涡。
Some users complained that expensive masks were unqualified, others spat on the air to scold netizens, more employees protested against pay cuts, and the brand got caught in a whirlpool of public opinion.
对此，名创优品方面回应燃财经称，口罩包装盒上确实用标签形式修改了文字内容，但口罩和生产厂家资质均可以在权威网站查询。
In response, the company said the mask packaging box did use labels to modify the text, but masks and manufacturers qualifications can be found in the authoritative website.
同时对方称，根据员工2、3月实际工作饱和度安排调薪待岗，不涉及裁员动作。
At the same time, the other side said, according to the actual staff in February, March job saturation arrangement, not involved in layoff action.
不过，燃财经咨询的专业医生并不认可名创优品的说法，他认为，通过投诉用户提供的照片来看，能证明口罩正规，但不能证明是其包装上所写的医用外科口罩，且该口罩售价虚高。
However, the specialist medical practitioner who conducted the financial consultation did not approve of the brand name, arguing that the photographs provided by the complainant showed that the mask was correct but did not prove that it was a medical surgical mask written on its packaging and that it was selling at a high price.
一系列事件背后，暴露出名创优品单一线下销售薄弱的风险承受能力，难以应对疫情冲击。
Behind a series of events, exposure to well-known premium products single-line sales of weak risk tolerance, difficult to cope with the epidemic.
业内人士提到，名创优品高性价比、高周转率、高毛利率、大规模开店的模式有一定优势，但其多年来“唱衰”电商，少做线上布局，此次疫情来临时就显示出了局限性。
Industry sources mentioned that the high cost-effective, high turnover, high gross margin, large-scale store opening model has some advantages, but its "bad" over the years, less on-line layout, when the epidemic came to show limitations.
下一步，复工复产后的供应链问题、短期内用户到店的消费疑虑、团队稳定问题、现金流压力都是名创优品将面临的挑战。
Next, the supply chain problem of returning to work and postpartum, consumer misgivings from customers to stores in the short term, team stability and cash flow pressures are some of the challenges that top performers will face.
新零售专家认为，由此带给名创优品及整个零售行业的警示是，不止到店零售能力，到家、社群零售能力将会是企业未来必备的技能。
The warning for premium brands and the retail industry as a whole, according to new retail experts, is that more than just retail capacity, home and community retailing will be a must-have skill for the future.
名创优品急于自救陷入口罩、降薪风波疫情之下口罩稀缺，不少企业靠口罩自救甚至一夜暴富。
Famous Chuangyou products in a hurry to save themselves into masks, wage crisis under the scarcity of masks, many enterprises rely on masks even overnight rich.
前不久，企查查显示，名创优品全资子公司发生工商变更，公司具体经营项目申报新增：医疗器械、设备、医疗卫生材料及用品提供专业清洗、消毒和灭菌，消毒用品销售。
Not long ago, the enterprise inspection showed that the name of the wholly owned subsidiary of the product changes, the company's specific business items declaration added: medical equipment, equipment, medical and health materials and supplies to provide professional cleaning, disinfection and sterilization, disinfection supplies sales.
名创优品也表示，此次工商变更主要是为了获得酒精消毒类、口罩类产品的销售资质。
Famous Chuang You also said that the main business change is to obtain alcohol disinfection, mask products sales qualification.
名创优品急于迎合刚需增加口罩品类，但此次因为口罩问题备受争议。
Famous products are eager to cater for the need to increase the category of masks, but this time because of the controversy over masks.
3月15日，用户“exc0liasxk”在黑猫投诉上称，“在名创优品上买了4盒医用外科口罩，780元，到货后，看到适用范围和使用限制前后矛盾，前面说在有创操作中佩戴，后面又说不得用于各类人员在有创操作中佩戴……在国家任何一个查询医用外科口罩的官网上，根本查不到这个口罩生产厂家，也查不到外包装上的注册证编号。
On March 15, the user "exc0liasxk" complained on the black cat, "bought 4 boxes of medical surgical masks on top of the top-quality products, 780 yuan, and found inconsistent application scope and usage restrictions.
”黑猫投诉平台上的用户投诉截图对此，燃财经求证名创优品，对方回应称，引发消费者质疑的医用外科口罩包装盒上确实存在两处用标签形式修改文字内容的情况。
In response to a user complaint shot on the Black Cat complaint platform, Caijing asked if there had been two label changes to the contents of the medical surgical mask packaging box, which raised questions from consumers.
经与生产商沟通，对方表示该批口罩包装盒由于文案表述方面的失误，造成整批产品均存在内容标识不清。
After communication with the manufacturer, the other side said that the mask packaging box due to misrepresentation of the text, resulting in the whole batch of products are not clearly marked.
厂方出于降低包装盒印刷成本的考虑，采取了贴标签的方式来减少损失，也因此对消费者造成了困扰和误导。
In order to reduce the cost of packaging box printing, the factory adopts the labeling method to reduce the loss, thus causing confusion and misdirection to the consumers.
名创优品表示，这款产品是可用于非无菌环境下的有创操作，但不得用于无菌环境下的有创操作（例如手术室）。
The company said the product could be used for invasive procedures in non-sterile environments, but not in sterile environments (such as operating rooms).
所以包装上使用限制的第2点“不得用于临床各类人员在有创操作、无菌操作及侵入性操作过程中佩戴”的原意是“不得用于临床各类人员在有创且无菌的操作及侵入性操作过程中佩戴”。
Therefore, point 2 of the restriction on the use of packaging "shall not be used by all categories of clinical personnel in the course of invasive operation, aseptic operation and invasive operation" is intended to be "not allowed to be worn by all categories of clinical personnel in the course of invasive and sterile operation."
同时，对方也指出，该批产品外包装上原印刷日期“20200306”系定制包装时失误导致的印刷错误，实际以标签覆盖的“20200303”及“20200302”为准。
Meanwhile, the other side also pointed out that the original printing date of "20200306" on the package was a misprint due to a mistake in customised packaging.
山东惠恩医疗器械有限公司拥有山东省许可的医疗器械生产资质。
Shandong Huian Medical Device Co. Ltd. has Shandong Province licensed medical device production qualification.
该批次医用外科口罩已于2020年2月28日注册备案，注册证编号为“鲁械注准20202140220”，具体可在国家药品监督管理局网站查询。
The batch of medical surgical masks was registered on February 28, 2020 under the registration number "Lu machinery injection 20202140220," which can be found on the website of the State Administration of Pharmaceutical Administration.
名创优品提供的口罩合格证明材料但是，燃财经拿该用户上传的口罩盒信息和名创优品提供的图片咨询了湖北某医院的医生，对方表示，仅从图片来看，能证明口罩正规，但不能证明是医用外科口罩。
However, a doctor at a hospital in Hubei province was consulted by Flaming Finance on the basis of pictures provided by the user's mask box information and name-based products. The other side said that the photos alone showed that the mask was normal but could not prove it was a medical surgical mask.
真正符合国标的医用外科口罩，一般都是独立包装，而且国标YY0469-2011或者YY0469-2011会印在明显位置。
Medical surgical masks that are truly compliant with national standards are usually individually packaged and will be prominently displayed on national mark YY0469-2011 or YY0469-2011.
在使用限制方面，他认为不能证明口罩是两层无纺布和一层熔喷层，不能用于有创操作。
In terms of use restrictions, he said, he could not prove that the mask was a two-layer nonwoven fabric and a layer of molten coating and could not be used for invasive operations.
他初步判断，图片中的口罩是普通医用口罩，成本在0.8元左右，出厂价约1.5-1.7元，名创优品200个卖780元，溢价不少。
He initially judged that the mask in the picture is a common medical mask, the cost of about 0.8 yuan, factory price of about 1.5-1.7 yuan, the best-known products 200 sold 780 yuan, a considerable premium.
不过，由于没有完整的包装盒和实物，无法给出确切的判定。
However, due to the lack of complete packaging boxes and physical objects, it is not possible to give a definitive judgement.
口罩引发的纠纷还不止于此。
There is more to the dispute over masks.
此前，名创优品被诟病口罩不单卖，需要消费满79元才送1个。
Previously, the name of premium products were not only sold, need to consume 79 yuan to send a.
后公司官微回复称：“个别门店为了防止部分用户恶意囤货，才采取了满赠的形式。
"Individual stores to prevent malicious hoarding to prevent some users, just took the form of a full gift.
”但有网友提出，“如果是为了防止恶意囤货，直接限购就行了。
But a netizen suggested, "If it is to prevent malicious hoarding, the direct limit on the purchase.
”另外，2月11日，名创优品一位女主播在直播卖口罩时，因消费者质疑库存等问题，她在直播中放出“狗咬人我不能咬回去”、“尽管投诉我们”等言论。
Separately, on Feb. 11, a presenter of Chong You, who was selling masks live, made comments such as "I can't bite my dog back" and "Don't complain about us," after consumers questioned inventory and other issues.
名创优品随后道歉并表示已终止与该主播的合作。
The company then apologized and said it had terminated its co-operation with the anchor.
口罩风波之外，降薪也是最近名创优品被热议的话题。
In addition to the issue of masks, pay cuts are also a recent hot topic of debate.
2月21日，名创优品发布《共克时艰倡议书》，称获得97.7%员工响应，在2-3月期间不同比例减薪，缩减运营费用开支。
On February 21, a group of top-notch products released the "Difficult Times Initiative," saying that 97.7 percent of workers responded by cutting their salaries in different proportions between February and March, reducing their operating expenses.
名创优品还对4月份情况做了预设，“若不是很乐观，公司会无条件按二三月的政策继续执行一个月”。
"If not very optimistic, the company will continue its February-March policy unconditionally for another month," the company said.
公司宣称是自愿选择，但不少员工反映是直接通知。
The company claims to have chosen voluntarily, but many employees reported direct notification.
一名名创优品宁夏店的员工告诉燃财经：“2月大家基本是未出勤，工资给30%，出勤的时段给80%，我二月上了三天班，给发放了837.52元，没有签任何的同意书，是直接下发的通知。
An employee of Chuang Youping Ningxia told Flaming Finance: "In February, people were basically absent from school, with 30% of their salaries and 80% of their attendance time.
”也有前员工指出了名创优品以往运营中存在的问题。
Former employees have also pointed to problems in the past operation of reputable premium products.
大连高新园区锦辉商城名创优品店的前兼职员工星星告诉燃财经，她去年在名创优品兼职了一个月，2000多元的工资至今一分都没拿到。
Star, a former part-time employee at Dalian's Jinghui Mall, told Flaming Finance that she worked part-time for a month on top-notch products last year and won't get a penny for more than 2,000 yuan.
平时，店里要求员工或亲戚朋友每月消费满3000元，店长会攒小票监督。
Normally, the store requires employees or relatives and friends to spend up to 3,000 yuan per month, store director will save small ticket supervision.
另外，微博上有不少网友称被强制降薪，或是被强制裁员。
In addition, Weibo a lot of netizens reported being forced to reduce wages, or forced layoffs.
对此，名创优品方面回复燃财经称：“根据国家人力资源和社会保障部1月24日发布的相关通知，企业受疫情影响可通过轮岗轮休、缩短工时等方式稳定工作岗位。
"According to a circular issued by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security on January 24, companies could stabilize their jobs by rotating shifts and shortening working hours, according to a report from the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security.
我们是根据员工2月、3月实际工作饱和度安排调薪待岗，留住工作岗位，不让员工流失，不涉及裁员的动作，所谓强制离职的说法没有依据。
We are based on the actual work saturation of February and March employees to arrange for job placement, to retain jobs, not to lose staff, do not involve layoffs, the so-called mandatory separation argument has no basis.
”“十元店”起家，冲击IPO公开资料显示，名创优品成立于2013年，是日本时尚休闲百货品牌，总部位于日本东京，由日本青年设计师三宅顺也和叶国富创办。
The company was founded in 2013 as a fashion and leisure department store based in Tokyo and founded by Japanese young designer Miyake Miyake and Ye Guofu, according to public information on the IPO.
名创优品的logo白底红字酷似优衣库，名字又和无印良品类似，再加上其产品包装和文字介绍都附有日语，很容易给人一种日本品牌的印象。
The logo, with its white background, resembles a UNIQLO library, and its name is similar to that of unprinted material, and its packaging and text description are in Japanese, giving the impression of a Japanese brand.
名创优品官方也称，坚持从世界各地选取合适的优质素材，其中超过80％的产品源于日本、韩国、新加坡、马来西亚及中国等地。
The company also says it is sticking to picking the right high-quality material from around the world, with more than 80% coming from places like Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia and China.
不过，翻看名创优品的产品说明可以发现，很多产品的委托生产方是中国企业，如洗脸巾的生产企业是稳健医疗（黄冈）有限公司、粘土套装的生产商是武义奥得士工贸有限公司、香水的提供方是深圳悦华龙化妆品有限公司、保湿爽肤水生产方是广东艾圣日用化学品有限公司，还有不少像发卡、伞、拖鞋、袜子、毛绒玩具等未注明生产企业，只有“产地广东”等字眼。
However, we can see from the product description that many products are made by Chinese enterprises. For example, the manufacturer of face-washing towels is Robust Medical (Huanggang) Ltd., the manufacturer of clay suits is Wuyi Odyssey & amp; Trade Co., Ltd., the perfume supplier is Shenzhen Yue Hua Long Cosmetics Co., Ltd.
名创优品门店产品图片 / 燃财经拍摄燃财经联系了其中提供保湿喷雾、爽肤水、粉底液、散粉的生产商广东艾圣日用化学品有限公司，对方提供了OEM合作流程图并表示，大致按照流程中来合作，还可以代购包装，等于是可以出完整的成品。

“名创优品的全部是我们做，包括品牌和外观设计，品牌策划设计是另外收费的，不同档次的产品都可以定制。
"We do all the branding and design, and the brand design is a separate charge, and the different grades of products can be customized.
”对方称。
"said the other.
代工厂合作流程图 / 受访者供图燃财经还联系到名创优品“超轻粘土套装”的生产商武义奥得士工贸有限公司，对方提到，他们是各类泥的生产厂家，名创优品的包装是自己设计的。
Flowcharts / Interviewees Supplying to Flaming Finance Also linked to Wuyi Odyssey Industries Ltd., a maker of premium goods "super light clay sets," were mentioned as manufacturers of various types of clay and the packaging of premium goods was self-designed.
当燃财经提出要定制一批产品时，对方表示：“和名创优品同类型的市场双方签署过协议，不可以出售产品，您可以自己设计一款包装，我们这边提供泥。
When Combustion Financials offered to customize a batch of products, the other side said: "We have signed an agreement with both sides of the market of the same type as Premium Brands. You can not sell the products.
”燃财经联系到的多家生产商和名创优品基本上都是类似的代工合作形式。
Many of the producers and premium goods associated with FCC are essentially similar forms of contract co-operation.
名创优品凭借着神似大牌产品却价格低廉迅速走红，但这也让它陷入多起版权争议和专利纠纷。
The brand-name blockbuster is fast becoming popular for its cheap, big-name products, but it has also been embroiled in copyright disputes and patent disputes.
企查查数据显示，与名创优品有关的法律诉讼与开庭公告等自身风险达62条，涉及的法律诉讼包括侵害相关专利权纠纷、侵害商标纠纷、侵害发明专利权纠纷和买卖合同纠纷等事由。
Corporate searches show that the risks of lawsuits and court notices related to premium products run to 62, involving such matters as infringement of patent rights disputes, infringement of trademark disputes, infringement of patent rights disputes over inventions and disputes over contracts of sale and purchase.
屈臣氏、曼秀雷敦、乐扣乐扣等都曾起诉名创优品侵害外观设计专利权。
Tucson's, Mentholatum, Oxygen buckle, etc. have all sued the name Chuangyou products infringe on the design patent.
此外，名创优品研发制造的化妆品也曾多次被曝光质量不过关。
In addition, well-known products developed and manufactured cosmetics have been repeatedly exposed to the quality of the substandard.
2019年名创优品因经营未取得批准文号的特殊用途化妆品，违反《化妆品卫生监督条例》的相关规定，收到来自广州市荔湾区食品药品监督管理局的行政处罚。
In 2019, the company received administrative penalty from the Food and Drug Administration of Lai Wan District of Guangzhou for operating special purpose cosmetics without approval number and violating the regulations of the Regulations on Sanitary Supervision of Cosmetics.
不过，名创优品发展一直很快，2018年，名创优品在全球79个国家和地区开设了3500多家门店，营收170亿元。
In 2018, Gifted Brands opened more than 3,500 stores in 79 countries and regions worldwide, generating 17 billion yuan in revenue.
截至2019年，公司门店数量已达4200家。
By 2019, the company had 4,200 stores.
去年6月，彭博社报道称，名创优品或拟通过IPO募资10亿美元，计划上市地点为中国香港或美国。
In June, Bloomberg reported that the IPO would raise $1bn, with plans to list in Hong Kong, China, or the US.
名创优品回应称，2018年1月，就已经在寻求IPO，公司内部正在为上市做全方位准备。
The company responded that it was already seeking an IPO in January 2018 and was preparing for a full listing within the company.
叶国富实体店战略受冲击疫情之下，一路高速扩张的名创优品，也显露出脆弱一面。
Yip Guofu entity shop strategy under the impact of the epidemic, all the way rapid expansion of the famous premium products, but also revealed a vulnerable side.
名创优品CEO叶国富在接受媒体采访时提到，在疫情最严重的2月份，名创优品关闭了国内50%门店，公司业绩下滑了95%。
In an interview with reporters, top-notch CEO Yip Guofu said the company's performance fell 95 percent in the worst February, when the company closed 50 percent of its stores.
业内人士认为，疫情带来如此大的业绩下滑，与名创优品单一的销售渠道有很大关系。
Industry insiders believe that the epidemic brought such a decline in performance, and the name of the single product sales channel has a lot to do.
叶国富是个对实体零售有着偏执梦想的人。
Yip Guofu is a paranoid dreamer of physical retailing.
他曾频频代表实体零售叫板电商：“电商‘先天不足’，新零售必定脱胎于实体”、“未来3-5年，电商会死掉一大片”、“新零售绝对不是线上+线下”。
He used to represent the entity retail call board electricity business: "the electricity business' inborn shortage ', the new retail must be born in the entity", "the next 3-5 years, the Chamber of Commerce died a large area", "the new retail is definitely not online + line."
江湖上还流传着叶国富三战电商的故事，他曾连发三个头版广告叫板马云、董明珠，还在各种公开场合不遗余力地看衰电商。
River lake also spread the story of Ye Guofu three war electric business, he has sent three front-page ads named board Ma Yun, Dong Mingzhu, and spared no effort in various public places to watch the decline of the electric business.
“我为什么认为‘双十一’一文不值呢?首先，它是一个人造的打折节，不管马云玩出多少花样，请来多少大牌，什么VR眼镜啊，还搞个晚会，也不管商家们是真降价还是假降价，都不能改变它是个打折促销活动的本质。
"Why do I think Double Eleventh is worthless? First of all, it's an artificial discount festival. No matter how much fun Ma plays with, how many cards to buy, what VR glasses, and a party, no matter whether the seller makes a real cut or a fake sale, cannot change the nature of a discount promotion.
换句话讲，在这个购物节里，便宜才是最高标准，这种模式的商业发展不靠创新，而靠打价格战，这不是消费升级，而是消费倒退。
In other words, in this shopping festival, where cheapness is the highest standard, this model of business development does not depend on innovation, but on fighting price wars, which are not an escalation of consumption, but a regression of consumption.
”叶国富曾说。
"said Ye Guofu.
百联咨询创始人庄帅认为，叶国富对外的言论一直就是看不上线上，他认为在线下开性价比高的小商品店可以跟电商竞争。
Bailian consulting founder Zhuang Shuai, Yip Guofu's external comments have been unable to see on-line, he thinks that the online open cost-effective small commodity stores can compete with the electric business.
“所以，名创优品这么多年来一直不重视线上拓展，去年底才做了一个小程序和服务号，实际上也没怎么运营，疫情之下就显示出了弊端。
"So, for so many years, we haven't paid much attention to online expansion, we did a small program and service number at the end of last year, and we didn't actually operate much," he said.
”庄帅指出。
"said Chuang Shuai.
但新零售专家鲍跃忠不这么认为：“名创优品以加盟制为主，实际上疫情下最主要承担损失的是加盟方，因为是他们租房子来经营。
But Bao Yuezhong, a new retail expert, disagrees: "The brand is dominated by franchises, which in fact bear the brunt of the epidemic because they rent houses."
疫情下行业内大多数公司更多的是在转型线上、做社群零售来推动经营，他们反而是对自己的团队采取了这么大的减薪措施。
Most companies in the industry are pushing their operations more along the transformation line, doing community retailing, and they are taking such big pay cuts to their own teams.
我觉得这几年名创优品‘跑’得有点急，这一次短时间内大降薪，可能不只是疫情问题，或许是借这个时间节点来降低成本。
I think these years the top products' run 'a bit urgent, this time a big pay cut, may not only be an epidemic, perhaps this time to reduce costs.
”“名创优品的模式本身是迎合中国这个时期的消费特点的，对比来看，日本在经济萧条期之后就出现了很多‘十元店’，二者的策略都是高性价比、高周转率、大规模开店，其实也有很高的毛利率，实际上这种模式有优势。
"In contrast to the pattern of premium goods, which itself caters to Chinese consumption patterns during this period, there have been a lot of ten-dollar stores in Japan since the economic downturn, both of which have a high gross profit margin, high turnover, large-scale store opening and, in fact, high gross margin.
”庄帅向燃财经分析。
Zhuang Shuai gave fuel to financial analysis.
但是在目前的情势下，庄帅认为还是要线上线下结合，探索更多的销售模式，包括无人售货。
However, in the current situation, Zhuang Shuai still want to combine online and offline, explore more sales models, including unsold goods.
名创优品开在购物中心或街边的单一渠道业态也需要思考模式，另外动销率不够高、季节性、非刚需的品类可能需要一些调整，供应链体系也需要区域化，并不断和线上结合来运作。
There is also a need to think about the mono-channel model in shopping centres or on the street. In addition, some adjustments may be needed in the categories that are not sufficiently marketable, seasonal and non-essential, and supply chain systems need to be regionalized and continuously integrated with online operations.
事实上，疫情期间，名创优品也做出了尝试，推出社交电商平台“名创优品员工内购”和直播带货，并与顺丰合作推出“同城急送”。
Indeed, during the epidemic, premium brands made an attempt to launch a social-electronics platform, called "Buy-In-Your-Name" and Live Delivery, and partnered with Shun Fung to launch the "Same City Express."
据悉，销售方式的调整让名创优品实现了线上销售额300%的环比增长，叶国富预计，2020年内，公司线上业务销售占比将会接近10%。
Sales adjustments are reported to have boosted online sales of premium goods by 300 per cent, and Mr Ye predicts the company will account for nearly 10 per cent of online sales in 2020.
3月16日，名创优品宣布，全面复工后公司新品价格将下调30%，通过“优质低价”策略杀入平价消费市场。
On March 16, the company announced that the full resumption of the company's new product prices will be reduced by 30%, through the "quality low" strategy into the affordable consumer market.
图 / 视觉中国不过上述两位业内人士一致认为，名创优品未来面临的挑战不小。
Photo / Vision China But the two industry insiders agree that the challenges ahead for premium brands are not small.
庄帅提到，首先是复工复产的问题，目前很多工人到岗、工厂开工、原料供应等都是问题，供应链端的挑战是其一；另外他们的很多店开在还没有完全解除危机的一二线城市，复工和到店消费都很难。
Zhuangshuai mentioned, first of all, the resumption of work, many workers to work, factory start, raw materials supply problems, etc., challenges on the supply chain; also, many of their stores in the first and second-tier cities that have not yet fully resolved the crisis, it is difficult to get back to work and to shop.
第三是团队，线下是劳动密集型业态，很多员工工资不高，也来自小城市或农村，能不能及时到岗，如何重新招聘也是问题。
Third, the team, is the labor-intensive industry offline, many staff wages are not high, but also from small cities or rural areas, can be timely to the post, how to re-recruit is also a problem.
最后，公司在资金层面也会有挑战，会有很多应付账款，但是没有销售额来支撑。
Finally, the company will also have a financial challenge, there will be a lot of accounts payable, but no sales to support.
鲍跃忠则指出了其竞争压力，“这几年，叶国富一直在讲商品、商品、商品，但他现在整体的商品面临着很大的挑战，包括NOME、三福百货对他都构成了直接竞争，所以他迫切需要做深度变革和调整。
Mr Bao pointed out the competitive pressures: "Over the past few years, Yip has been talking about goods, commodities and commodities, but he now faces great challenges to his entire product portfolio, including NOME and Sanfu, which is a direct competition for him, so he urgently needs to make deep changes and adjustments.
”这次疫情给名创优品乃至整个零售行业敲响了警钟，鲍跃忠坚持认为，线下零售业态渠道不能太单一，到店零售能力、到家零售能力、社群零售能力企业都应该具备。
The epidemic is a wake-up call for premium brands and the retail industry as a whole, with Mr Bao insisting that offline retailing channels should not be too homogenous, to store retail capacity, home retail capacity, and community retailing capabilities.
