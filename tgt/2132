澎湃新闻记者 沈文迪 温潇潇2月15日，武汉迎来了庚子鼠年的第一场雪。
On Feb. 15, Wuhan hosted the first snow of the Year of the Gengzi mouse.
这天上午，李悦（化名）的父亲因患新冠肺炎，在经历两个多小时的抢救无效后去世。
That morning, Li Yue (alias) 's father died of pneumonia after more than two hours of unsuccessful rescue efforts.
而就在一天前，作为早前新冠肺炎的康复者，李悦冒着严寒、拖着还有些虚弱的身体，踩了一路共享单车重返武汉市金银潭医院，成为该院首位自愿捐献血浆的康复者。
Just a day ago, Li Yue, an early survivor of pneumonia, braved severe cold and dragged his frail body to return to the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital in Wuhan, becoming the hospital's first voluntary donor of plasma.
抱着一丝希望的她，想用自己的血浆去救父亲。
Holding a glimmer of hope, she wanted to save her father with her own plasma.
希望还是破灭了。
Hopes were still dashed.
这一个多月来，李悦就像做了无数场噩梦：先是癌症晚期的母亲病情恶化；接着疫情爆发后，自己和父亲先后被确诊为新冠肺炎；在父亲离去后，母亲的治疗又一度陷入僵局，最终离去……如今李悦独自守着空荡荡的屋子，无比希望这段记忆也一同被隔离尘封。
For more than a month, Li Yue seemed to have had countless nightmares: first, his mother became ill with terminal cancer; then, after the outbreak, she and her father were diagnosed with pneumonia; after her father left, the mother's treatment was deadlocked and eventually left... Now Li Yue is alone in the empty house.
三口之家这原本是个幸福美满的三口之家。
A family of three This used to be a happy family of three.
李悦的父亲67岁，退休后父亲喜欢宅在家里，摆弄相机、修图看电影；母亲63岁，热爱美食的她喜欢跳广场舞、打腰鼓，还和伙伴们到各地演出。
Li Yue's 67-year-old father likes to stay at home, tinker with his camera and mow movies, and her 63-year-old gourmet lover of square dancing, waist drums and shows with her friends.
李悦的父亲和母亲 受访者供图他们的独女李悦从小就很优秀，北京大学毕业后，2016年她去到英国工作，未来一片光明。
After graduating from Peking University, where she went to work in the UK in 2016, her future was bright.
初到英国的日子并不孤单，李悦时常都会和母亲视频聊天，隔着八小时的时差讲述着彼此的生活与见闻。
I was not alone in my first days in England. Li Yue often chatted with her mother on video, telling each other about their lives and experiences after eight hours of jet lag.
但2016年底开始，李悦慢慢发现母亲时常拒接视频电话、智能语音。
But at the end of 2016, Li Yue slowly discovered that his mother often refused to answer video phone, intelligent voice.
问起来，母亲说自己在温泉休养，信号不佳。
Asked, his mother said he was recuperating in hot springs, signal bad.
感觉到异样的李悦开始到处询问亲人，但得到的回复都是没事，李悦之后想来，觉得应该是母亲给他们打了招呼，不让自己担心。
Feeling strange Li Yue began to ask relatives everywhere, but the response is nothing, Li Yue came to think that it should be their mother to say hello, do not worry about themselves.
但母亲的病情终究还是被发现了。
But the mother's illness was finally discovered.
2017年夏天，李悦假期回国后才知道，母亲已经是直肠癌晚期，而且做过了一轮化疗和手术。
In the summer of 2017, Li Yue returned home to learn that her mother was already in advanced rectal cancer and had undergone a round of chemotherapy and surgery.
李悦瞬间崩溃了，她很难想象，母亲是如何瞒着她独自把病痛扛了下来。
Li Yue collapsed in a moment. She could hardly imagine how her mother could have carried off the illness without her knowing it.
李悦的父亲起初也是和李悦一样的反应，懵了好几天，在母亲的支撑和鼓励下才慢慢接受现实。
Li Yue's father was the same reaction as Li Yue, Meng for several days, in the mother's support and encouragement only slowly accept the reality.
在接下来的三年里，夫妻俩的爱好都停了。
Over the next three years, the couple stopped loving each other.
父亲每日奔波在家和医院之间，给母亲送饭、陪护、擦洗身体。
The father travels daily between home and the hospital, bringing food to his mother, accompanying her and wiping her body.
由于直肠癌患者比较特殊，身上开了一个造口用于排泄，更换和清理工作也由父亲承包了。
Because rectal cancer patient is quite special, the body opens an orifice for excretion, the replacement and clean-up work is also contracted by the father.
在母亲患病后，李悦原本想要回国陪伴，但母亲不允许她这么做，去国外发展是她对女儿的期望。
After her mother became ill, Li Yue wanted to go back to China to accompany her, but her mother would not allow her to do so.
就连李悦回国后，母亲也不愿意她来医院，她不想女儿看到肿瘤科病人的痛苦。
Even after Li Yue returned home, her mother did not want her to come to the hospital, she did not want her daughter to see cancer patients suffering.
从这时起，母女俩开始天天视频，起初母亲会说很多话，但随着病情的加重，她能说话的时间越来越短，画面中的母亲也越来越瘦。
From then on, the mother and daughter began to video everyday. At first, the mother would talk a lot, but as her illness got worse, she was able to speak for less and less time.
“我妈妈是非常好强的一个人，就算疼，她也不愿意给人添麻烦。
"My mother is such a strong person that she doesn't want to cause any trouble even if it hurts.
有些病人会呻吟，会找护士，她只会用手紧紧地攥着枕头，眉头皱得很紧，一直忍着。
Some patients groan and go to a nurse, who clenches her hands tightly to the pillow, frowning tightly and enduring.
问她是不是很疼。
Ask her if it hurts.
她会点头，但不吭声。
She will nod, but not say a word.
”李悦说。
'said Li Yue.
2019年12月，在第三轮治疗不见效果的情况下，日渐虚弱的母亲无法进食，开始靠打营养针维持生命。
In December 2019, in the absence of a third round of treatment, the increasingly weak mother was unable to feed and began to rely on nutritional injections to sustain her life.
但一段时间后，母亲想要停针，和家人度过最后的日子。
But after a while, my mother wanted to stop taking needles and spend her last days with her family.
此时母亲每天要打45毫克吗啡，服用强效止痛药，但癌痛仍然让她备受折磨。
At this point, the mother to play 45 milligrams of morphine daily, take strong painkillers, but cancer pain still makes her suffer.
某天在视频的时候，父母告诉李悦，母亲已经写了不抢救声明：停针后出现任何需要急救的情况，希望医生不要采取任何急救措施。
One day in the video, parents told Li Yue, the mother has written a non-rescue statement: Stop needle after any situation requiring first aid, hope doctors do not take any emergency measures.
李悦说，自己是不能接受这个决定的，但等她亲眼看到母亲有多痛苦时，她才明白，母亲不是为了自己而活，而是为了自己和父亲而活。
Li said she could not accept the decision, but when she saw how painful her mother was, she realized that her mother lived not for herself but for herself and her father.
然而还没等到一家人做出最后决定给母亲停针，新冠肺炎爆发。
But before the family made a final decision to stop the needle from her mother, the outbreak of pneumonia.
另一场意外冲击了这个家庭，母亲必须坚持下去，她最爱和最爱她的人还在等待着她。
Another unexpected shock hit the family, and the mother had to persevere. Her favorite and favorite person was still waiting for her.
感染2020年1月9日，母亲突然问李悦能否回国，李悦一听知道母亲可能时日无多，第二天就从伦敦飞回了武汉。
On January 9, 2020, my mother asked Li Yue if she could return to China. Li Yue heard that her mother might not be around long before she flew back to Wuhan the next day.
李悦的机票 受访者供图回国后医生告知她，必须24小时陪护。
Li Yue's air ticket respondents to return to the country after the doctor told her that must be accompanied 24 hours.
一是生活上的照料，二是母亲的情绪也要安抚。
The first is the care of life, the second is to calm the mood of the mother.
一位护士偷偷告诉她，母亲痛得一个人发脾气，担心会轻生。
A nurse secretly told her that her mother was in such pain that she was afraid of losing her temper.
李悦义无反顾地24小时待在医院病房，父亲中午坐着公交来送饭，一直到晚上7、8点再坐公交回家。
Li Yue irresistibly stayed in the hospital ward for 24 hours, and his father took the bus to take his meals at noon until 7 or 8 pm before taking the bus home.
此时此刻，一家人全然不知新冠病毒的传染性有多强。
At the moment, the family has no idea how contagious the new crown virus is.
李悦说，从回国后，她只在室外戴口罩，在医院里并未做防护，回家后也未进行消毒措施。
After returning home, Li said, she only wore a mask outside the house, did not do protection in the hospital, and did not disinfect after returning home.
直到1月19日，李悦注意到病房的医生和护士开始戴起了两层口罩，里面N95、外面外科口罩；平时不戴帽子的医护人员开始戴起了两层帽子，把头发都收了进去。
On January 19, Li noted that doctors and nurses in the ward began wearing two masks, inside N95, and outside surgical masks; otherwise bareheaded paramedics began to put on two hats and put in all their hair.
一位医生把李悦叫了出去，告知她家属在病房时也要把口罩戴上，说外面的情况比想象的严重的多。
A doctor called Li Yue out and told her family to put on their masks while in the ward, saying things outside were much worse than expected.
从这时开始，李悦真正警惕起来，匆匆抢了一盒口罩。
From then on, Li Yue became really alert and snatched a box of masks.
然而最让人担心的事还是发生了。
But the most worrying thing happened.
之后几天里，李悦一直觉得嗓子痒，想咳嗽。
For the next few days, Li Yue felt an itchy throat and coughed.
1月25日中午，她开始发烧和轻微咳嗽，她想着等一天看看，也许只是医院环境干燥，睡一觉可能就好了。
At noon on January 25, she began to have a fever and a slight cough. She wanted to wait for a day, perhaps just a dry hospital environment.
但第二天过来情况没有好转，她和父亲一起去了发热门诊，她的CT显示肺部有斑片状的磨玻璃影，父亲也是如此，检查结果符合新型肺炎特征。
But when things didn't improve the next day, she went to a fever clinic with her father, whose CT scan showed a speckled glassy shadow of the lungs, as did her father, whose results matched the characteristics of a new type of pneumonia.
但因为没有进行核酸检测，他们还无法被确诊。
But they could not be diagnosed because nucleic acid tests were not performed.
父亲（左）和李悦（右）的CT结果 受访者供图从1月27日开始，李悦和父亲没法继续留在医院陪护母亲，必须在家隔离，他们请了一位护工阿姨来照顾母亲。
Father (left) and Li Yue (right) computed tomography (CT) showed Li and her father could no longer stay in the hospital to stay with their mothers. They had to stay home and isolate them. They hired an aunt and nurse to look after their mother.
但母亲说自己一个人能行，去上厕所也不会麻烦别人，硬撑着自己去。
But my mother said she could do it all by herself and would not bother anyone else to go to the bathroom.
回家后的父亲一直挂念着母亲，提到母亲就哭，他懊恼自己无法陪在爱人身边，只能通过电话进行联系。
When his father came home, he remembered his mother and cried at the mention of her. He was angry that he could not be with his sweetheart and could only communicate by telephone.
更让他懊恼和自责的，是这个时候让女儿回国，感染上了病毒。
What makes him more chagrined and remorseful is that this is the time to let his daughter return to the country, infected with the virus.
几经周折后，父亲和李悦分别于1月30日和31日被收治到武汉市第八医院，两人在不同楼层的两个病房里。
After many twists and turns, his father and Li Yue were admitted to Wuhan Eighth Hospital on January 30 and 31, respectively. They were in two wards on different floors.
实际上李悦在住院前就已经退烧，住院后她托人买了丙球蛋白给自己和父亲用上，加上抗病毒和消炎药，她的病情很快就稳定下来。
In fact, Li Yue had a fever before she was admitted to the hospital. She had them bought herself and her father propolis, and her condition stabilized quickly with antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs.
但父亲则情况不佳。
But the father is not doing well.
他从1月31日凌晨开始发烧，体温39.5摄氏度，由于患者太多，他没有接受更多治疗，只是靠自带的退烧药强撑着。
He had a fever since the early hours of January 31, with a temperature of 39.5 degrees Celsius. Too many patients prevented him from receiving more treatment and was forced to take his own antipyretics.
医生也告诉李悦，此时第八医院只是临时安置病人的地方，连核酸检测都做不了。
The doctor also told Li Yue that the Eighth Hospital was only a temporary place for patients, even nucleic acid testing can not be done.
一天内父亲所在的楼层已经走了三个病人。
Three patients had already been taken at his father's floor in one day.
医生还告诉李悦，新冠肺炎需要靠自身免疫力来做斗争，但在医院，早饭、午饭是饺子，晚上是米饭和冬瓜，家里也没人可以给他们送饭，此时李悦甚至对住进医院萌生悔意。
Doctors also told Li Yue that his own immunity was needed to fight the disease, but at the hospital, with dumplings for breakfast, lunch and rice and winter melon at night, and no one at home could bring them food, Li even regretted being admitted to the hospital.
2月1日李悦在住院时的早饭（左）和午饭（右） 图来自“自拍”，经受访者同意发布她只能通过外卖来给自己和父亲补充营养，由于隔离，她始终无法见到父亲。
Li Yue's breakfast (left) and lunch (right) in hospital on February 1 came from "autoclap," with respondents agreeing that she could only take out food to nourish herself and her father, and because of isolation, she never saw her father.
直到2月3日，她得知被确诊新冠肺炎的父亲需要被转到金银潭医院。
It was not until 3 February that she learned that her father, who had been diagnosed with pneumonia, needed to be transferred to the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital.
在送父亲上救护车时，她发现父亲已经很虚弱，但她没能想到，这会成为永别。
When she saw her father in the ambulance, she found him already weak, but she did not think that it would be a farewell.
等不到的血浆李悦的父亲被转到金银潭医院后渐渐有了好转，能够自主呼吸，氧饱和度有所提升。
Unable to wait for the plasma of Li Yue's father was transferred to the gold and silver pool hospital gradually improved, able to breathe autonomously, oxygen saturation improved.
但医生告知她，老人的炎症始终无法消除，一直在发烧。
But the doctor told her that the old man's inflammation could not be eliminated and that he was feverish.
期间李悦三餐都会给父亲打电话，鼓励他吃东西。
During his three meals, Li Yue would call his father and encourage him to eat.
2月5日，被确诊新冠肺炎的李悦也被转到了金银潭医院，期间第二次CT检查显示，她的肺部已经有了明显好转。
On February 5, Li Yue, who was diagnosed with pneumonia, was transferred to the Golden and Silver Pool Hospital, where a second CT scan showed a marked improvement in her lungs.
在三次核酸检测为阴性之后，她于2月9日出院。
She was discharged from hospital on 9 February after negative tests for three nucleic acids.
之后她回家静养，一边照顾着母亲的情绪，同时还要时刻揪心着父亲的情况。
Then she went home to rest, looking after her mother and worrying about her father.
父亲告诉她，出院后就待在家里，母亲那边也不要去，保护好自己。
Her father told her to stay at home after she left the hospital, and her mother did not go there to protect themselves.
2月12日，她接到医生电话，得知父亲病情恶化，刚被抢救回来。
On 12 February, she received a telephone call from her doctor, who told her that her father had deteriorated and that he had just been rescued.
医生告诉她，父亲的情况已经很危急，中西药都用过了，仍然没有好转。
The doctor told her that her father's condition was critical and that Chinese and Western medicine had been used, but it was still not improving.
李悦除了着急和无奈，没有别的办法。
Li Yue had no choice but to worry and be helpless.
偶然的情况下，她看到新闻说江夏区有11个病人在接受了新冠肺炎康复者捐献的血浆后，治疗有了明显效果。
By chance, she saw news that 11 patients in the Jiangxia area had significant effects after receiving plasma donated by patients recovering from New Crown Pneumonia.
她立马打电话给医生，询问自己是否可以捐献血浆，得到了肯定的答复。
She immediately called the doctor and asked if she could donate blood plasma, and received a positive response.
武汉市金银潭医院院长张定宇向澎湃新闻介绍，一个人的血浆大概可以救两三个人。
Wuhan City gold and silver pool hospital director Zhang Dingyu to Peng Pai news, a person's plasma may save two or three people.
血浆疗法不能说输了血浆就保证病人百分之百存活，但是拥有血浆以后会给危重患者增加存活机会，也为医生救治提供时间。
Plasma therapy does not guarantee 100 per cent survival without plasma, but having plasma increases the chances of survival for critically ill patients and provides time for medical treatment.
2月14日，李悦毅然赶往金银潭医院。
On February 14, Li Yue rushed to the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital.
由于没有交通工具，社区也无法安排车辆，她只能和出院时一样，自己骑了六七公里的共享单车来到医院。
With no means of transport and no means of transport, the community was unable to arrange transport, and she had to ride a shared bicycle of six or seven kilometres to the hospital as she had left the hospital.
在献血的过程中，她有些紧张，一旁穿着防护服的医生不停地给她安慰和解释，“0.01秒，0.01秒的疼痛，就好了。
During the blood donation, she was nervous and was reassured and explained to her by a doctor in protective clothing, "0.01 seconds, 0.01 seconds of pain."
”抽血的过程很顺利，她被告知自己的血浆还需要被送到实验室进行病毒检测、灭活后检测抗体的成分，如果有效的话还要进行提取和加工，最后提供给患者。
The procedure went smoothly, and she was told that her plasma would have to be sent to a laboratory for virus detection, inactivation, antibody detection and, if effective, extraction and processing, and finally to the patient.
李悦捐献血浆 图来自梨视频视频截图等回家后，她开心地给父亲打去电话，告诉他自己已经献了血浆，让他再坚持几天，也许很快就会有“解药”用到他身上，这样他们就可以一起去看母亲了。
Li Yue donates blood plasma from a video clip of a pear. After returning home, she happily calls her father and tells him that he has given his plasma for a few more days and that a "cure" may soon be available for him so that they can visit his mother together.
电话那头，父亲喘得非常厉害，说不了几句话。
At the other end of the line, my father gasped so hard that he could not speak.
李悦并不确定，父亲是否听到了自己的鼓励。
Li Yue was not sure if his father had heard his encouragement.
李悦心里明白，血浆从抽血到用于治疗患者大约需要七天时间，父亲用上的可能性有些渺茫，但她还是抱着一丝希望，希望父亲能够再坚持一下。
Li understood that it would take about seven days for plasma to pass from blood to treatment, and that the chances of a father using it were slim, but she hoped her father would hold out again.
她说，“就算我爸爸用不上，其他的患者也可能可以用得上。
"Even if my dad doesn't need it, other patients may be able to use it," she said.
”希望只持续了一个晚上。
"The hope lasted only one night.
第二天上午八点，李悦接到电话，父亲被送往ICU进行抢救；两个小时后，又一个电话打来，父亲去世了。
The next morning at 8 a.m., Li Yue received a telephone call, his father was sent to ICU rescue; two hours later, another phone call, his father died.
没有最后一面，没有遗言，李悦就这样“告别”了父亲。
No last side, no last words, Li Yue so "farewell" to his father.
所有的事后手续都在手机上办理，她添加了一个叫汉口殡仪馆的微信号，在发送了所有的证明后，当晚父亲的遗体就被火化。
All the formalities were done on her mobile phone, and she added a microphone called Hankou mortuary. After sending all the documents, her father's body was cremated that night.
2月15日那天，武汉下起了雪，医院让李悦尽快去医院领取父亲的遗物，但恶劣的天气加上悲伤的心情，李悦已经走不动一步路。
On Feb. 15, it snowed in Wuhan. The hospital asked Li Yue to pick up his father's belongings as soon as possible, but the bad weather and sadness made Li Yue unable to walk a step further.
她缓了一天后，才在武汉志愿者的帮助下，找到一辆电动共享单车，迎着悲伤的雨雪，她又一次去了金银潭医院。
After a slow day, she found an electric bike with the help of Wuhan volunteers to meet the sad rain and snow, she went to the gold and silver pool hospital again.
未完成的告别“我觉得她心里应该是知道的，因为之前我爸爸都会跟她联系，然后他们现在已经很长一段时间都没有联系了。
Unfinished Farewell "I think she knew because my dad had been in touch with her before, and they haven't been in touch for a long time.
”李悦哽咽地说，自己还没把父亲过世的消息告诉母亲。
"said Li choking, not telling her mother that her father had passed away.
此前母亲想停掉营养针慢慢离去，但因为丈夫和女儿被感染隔离，她必须再坚持一段时间，再见上他们一面。
The mother wanted to stop the needles and leave slowly, but because her husband and daughter were infected and isolated, she had to stick with them for a while and see them again.
李悦自责地说，“我觉得这也挺自私的，我们想让她坚持到我们出去，能陪她走完最后一程。
"I think it's selfish," Li said to herself. "We want her to hang on until we get out and go with her for the last time.
”在李悦捐献血浆后没多久，母亲所在医院的院区被征用收治新冠肺炎患者。
Shortly after Li Yue donated plasma, the hospital compound where her mother worked was requisitioned to treat patients with pneumonia.
医院护士告诉她，留在医院的非新冠肺炎患者会有交叉感染的风险，而且由于部分医护人员被调走，母亲的照料无法像之前周全，所以建议她把母亲接回家。
The hospital nurse told her that non-Newly Coronary Pneumonia patients who remained in the hospital were at risk of cross-infection and that the mother's care was inadequate because some of the staff had been transferred and she was advised to take her mother home.
但李悦刚康复不久，在家也没法给母亲打针，只能将她继续留在医院。
But soon after her recovery, Li was unable to give an injection to her mother at home, but kept her in hospital.
随后的日子里，母亲的营养针中断了，李悦给母亲打电话时，母亲的意识已不太清醒。
In the days that followed, when her mother's nutrition needle was cut off and Li Yue called her mother, her consciousness was no longer clear.
李悦母亲所在的病房 受访者供图绝望的李悦一一给医生和护士打去电话，得到的都是无奈的回复，其他医院也无力收治癌症晚期病人。
Li Yue's patients in her ward gave desperate calls to doctors and nurses, all of whom responded helplessly, and other hospitals were unable to treat patients with advanced cancer.
此时本应该一周更换一次的造口袋由于父亲的离去，已经两周无人更换，李悦更是心急如焚。
At this time should be changed once a week because of his father's departure, has not been replaced in two weeks, Li Yue is even more anxious.
她只能到处求人，多次与医院沟通之后，医护人员2月17日深夜把母亲的止痛针打上。
She had to beg for help everywhere, and after many conversations with the hospital, paramedics beat her mother's painkiller late at night on February 17.
2月18日，武汉市卫健委官网发布最新消息，公布全市非新冠肺炎特殊患者医疗救治医院名单，李悦母亲所在的医院被列为恶性肿瘤定点救治医院，她的营养针终于在当天重新打上。
On February 18, Wuhan Health Officers' Network released the latest news, announced the city's list of hospitals for special patients with non-new crown pneumonia, Li Yue's hospital was listed as a targeted treatment hospital for malignant neoplasms, and her nutrition needle was finally re-opened the same day.
然而护工告诉李悦，母亲的精神状态很差，说话只能嗯嗯啊啊，她担心母亲撑不了多久。
The nurse told Li Yue, however, that her mother was in a bad mood and could only talk. Well, she was worried that her mother would not last long.
而她目前还处于隔离期，小区被封闭，无法正常进出，她甚至都开始担心是否能见到母亲最后一面。
But she is still in isolation, the small area is closed, unable to enter and leave regularly, she even began to worry about whether to see her mother the last time.
2月20日上午，医生给李悦打来电话，由于母亲的情况十分危急，医生向李悦确认，母亲之前签下的不抢救通知书是否还有效。
On the morning of Feb. 20, the doctor called Li Yue. Because her mother's condition was critical, the doctor confirmed to Li whether her previous non-rescue notice was still valid.
忍着悲痛，李悦表示尊重母亲的意愿，让母亲安稳地离去，她不希望母亲再遭受病痛的折磨。
Suffering her grief, Li Yue expressed respect for her mother's wishes and let her leave safely. She did not want her mother to suffer any more pain.
下午，医院的电话再次打来——在父亲离去5天之后，李悦又失去了母亲。
In the afternoon, the hospital called again - five days after her father left, Li Yue lost her mother again.
当天，李悦带着一件中国风外套、白色裙子以及鞋袜走到小区门口。
On the same day, Li Yue took a Chinese-style jacket, white skirt and shoes and socks to the door of the community.
生前母亲告诉她，这是自己旅游时穿的衣服，她希望自己在离开人世的时候再穿上，就当是又出了一趟远门。
Her mother told her that this was the dress she had worn during her travels, and she wished that she would put it on when she died, as if she had gone on another trip.
然而李悦的姑妈打来电话，老人在电话里哭着劝她不要再去医院，这个家庭已经失去了太多，她不希望李悦再出任何一点事。
However, Li Yue's aunt called, the old man cried on the phone to persuade her not to go to the hospital, the family has lost too much, she did not want Li Yue to do anything more.
虽然满是遗憾，李悦还是答应了，她将母亲的身后事交给了护工，独自回了家。
Though full of regret, Li Yue agreed. She left her mother behind to the nurse and went home alone.
家里还是父母离开之前的样子。
The family is the same as it was before the parents left.
每天早上，李悦会做做广播操。
Every morning, Li Yueyue does radio exercises.
经过复查，她已经没有新冠肺炎的症状，但仍在咳嗽，做操有助于她恢复。
Upon review, she no longer had symptoms of pneumonia, but was still coughing and doing exercises helped her recover.
家里物资充足，她喜欢做饭，心情会好很多。
She likes cooking and will be in a much better mood.
每当胡思乱想的念头袭来，她会看看电视，看看窗外的景色。
She would watch the television and look out of the window every time a cranky idea hit.
关于已经发生的厄运，她劝自己不要去想。
She advised herself not to think about what had happened.
她说，父母已经离去，她一个人要养好身体，这是父母生前所希望的，也是身边的亲友所关心的。
She said that her parents had left, and that she had to raise her health alone, which her parents had hoped for and the people around her cared about.
她还在期待雪停的那一刻，这样她就能走出家门，感受到春日的阳光，再去和父母好好地告别。
She was still waiting for the snow to stop so she could walk out of the house, feel the spring sun and say good-bye to her parents.
