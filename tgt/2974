澎湃新闻记者 陈伊萍 通讯员 何东用微波炉加热纸币能起到消毒作用？答案是否定的，还非常危险。
Chen Yiping correspondent Chen Yiping, a journalist, can disinfect paper money by heating it in the microwave oven.
日前，有市民担心纸币上沾染病毒，将纸币放入微波炉里加热“消毒”，结果纸币被烧焦，差点引起火灾。
A few days ago, some people worried about the virus on paper currency, put paper money into the microwave oven to "disinfect", the paper money was scorched, almost causing a fire.
3月4日16点20分许，一位中年女性客户来到农行上海徐汇漕溪支行柜台前，拿出了一沓黑乎乎且极其不规整的现金，小心翼翼地问道：“请问这些钱被烧坏了，可以兑换吗？”按照人民银行规定，破损人民币兑换需要根据钞票的损毁程度而定。
At about 16: 20 on March 4, a middle-aged female customer came to the Caoxi sub-branch of ABC Shanghai Xuhui Caoxi Sub-office and carefully asked, "Excuse me, is this money burned out?
市民把用微波炉烧焦的纸币送到银行“抢救”  农行供图轻轻拿起这些钞票，柜员谢佳炜仔细地将粘连在一起的纸币分开，因为钞票局部已经被碳化而变得很脆，一碰就会有碎屑掉落，这直接增加了工作的难度。
When residents took their microwave-scorched notes to the bank to "rescue" the bank, the teller, Wei Xie, carefully separated the glued notes because they were partially carbonized and brittle, adding directly to the difficulty.
此时网点已经关门结束营业，但谢佳炜依然耐心地为客户将钞票一张张小心分离开，与运营副主管沈颖嘉一起逐张鉴别钞票。
By this time the network was closed, but Mr Xie patiently parted notes for customers and worked with Ms Shen, deputy head of operations, to identify the notes.
同时，沈颖嘉与上级库房进行沟通，尽最大可能为客户挽回更多的损失。
At the same time, Shen Yingjia and the superior warehouse to communicate, as far as possible to recover more losses for customers.
在鉴别处理破损人民币时，客户告知，原来疫情当前，她买菜回家后担心人民币被病毒沾染，于是放入了微波炉进行消毒，没想到人民币都被烧焦了。
In the identification and treatment of damaged Renminbi, the customer informed that the original outbreak of the current, she returned home worried about the yuan was contaminated, so put into the microwave oven to disinfect, did not expect the renminbi were scorched.
烧焦的纸币谢佳炜听了之后马上为客户普及安全知识，强调用微波炉“消毒”人民币的做法非常危险，人民币是纸币，且上面还有油墨、金属安全线等，在高温干燥环境下极易被点燃。
The charred currency, Xie Jiawei, immediately introduced safety messages to customers, stressing the dangers of using the microwave oven to sterilize the currency, which is paper currency and has ink and metal safety lines that can easily be ignited in a hot, dry environment.
再加上微波炉正在运作，若引发电器爆炸，后果将不堪想象。
Add to that the microwave oven is in operation, and if it triggers an electrical explosion, the consequences will be unimaginable.
经过45分钟的耐心处理，该行将客户递交的十元至一百元，含四种票面，张数达51张的特殊残损券兑换为可流通钞券交到客户手中。
After a 45-minute period of patient handling, the bank converted from $10 to $100, including four coupons and 51 tickets, into banknotes for delivery to the customer.
虽然还有部分钞票因烧毁实在太严重已无法兑换，但客户依然对网点工作人员的专业水平和服务态度再三表示感谢，“我没想到微波炉竟然把人民币烧的那么焦，本以为这2000元要损失了，没想到还能拿回1090元，太谢谢你们了！”无独有偶，2月23日中午，一位阿姨携带装有若干张5元、10元面值人民币的保鲜袋来到农行上海徐汇凌云路支行寻求帮助。
"I didn't expect the microwave oven to burn the RMB so badly, but I thought it would cost me $1,090, thank you very much.At noon on February 23, an aunt came to the Shanghai branch of ABC's Xuhui Lingyun Road Sub-office for help.
原来也是道听途说，误以为将纸币置于微波炉中加热可以起到消毒作用。
It turned out to be a myth that placing paper money in the microwave oven would disinfect them.
回忆当时场景，阿姨激动说道：“当时微波炉突然起火，我真是被惊吓住了，所幸家人及时切断了电源，没有引起更严重的后果！”网点员工强调了该行为的危险性，并极力劝阻阿姨不要再盲目去尝试这些“歪门邪道”，在防疫期间做好最基本且合理的消毒工作才是最安全的。
"When the microwave burst into flames, I was really shocked, but fortunately my family cut off the power supply in time for no more serious consequences," said Auntie, recalling the scene. "The network staff stressed the danger of the act and strongly advised aunts not to blindly try these" evil ways, "the most basic and reasonable disinfection work during the epidemic prevention is the safest.
烧焦的纸币客户情绪稳定后，该行员工对这些纸币进行了谨慎的检查和识别，并为顾客进行了兑换。
When the charred paper money became stable, the bank's employees carefully checked and identified it and exchanged it for customers.
至此，阿姨意识到自己被谣言误导了，也为自己的行为深感后怕，同时也感谢农行员工的真诚劝阻和帮助，表示以后不会再做如此危险的举动。
At this point, auntie realized that she was misled by the rumor, and was deeply afraid of her behavior, but also thanked ABC staff for their sincere dissuasion and help, saying she would not do such a dangerous act in the future.
防疫工作刻不容缓。
The epidemic prevention is urgent.
银行工作人员提醒广大客户要科学防疫，不要盲目尝试“危险偏方”，积极保护并安全使用人民币。
Bank staff remind customers to scientific epidemic prevention, do not blindly try "dangerous folk prescription," actively protect and use the renminbi.
