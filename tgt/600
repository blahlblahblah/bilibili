这样的经历让我们这次“两人世界”变得很值得、很难忘，也很有意义。
This experience makes our "world of two" worthwhile, memorable and meaningful.
当我们跟家里老人说，将帮助海外华人实现爱心心愿、把援助物资运回国时，他们也都非常支持。
They were also very supportive when we told the old people that they would help overseas Chinese realize their loving wishes and send their aid home.
老人还让我们放心，说家里孩子都没事。
The old man reassured us that the children at home were all right.
口述 | 王珠凤整理 | 应　琛我叫王珠凤，是上海海关隶属嘉定海关的关员。
At the request of Wang Zhufeng, a customs officer attached to Jiading Customs in Shanghai.
1月24日，我和老公按照原定计划去往迪拜旅游。
On January 24, my husband and I went to Dubai as planned.
我们本来准备先在迪拜城市里玩三天，然后去沙漠玩两天。
We were going to spend three days in Dubai, then two days in the desert.
但计划赶不上变化。
But plans have not kept pace.
第一天晚上回到酒店后，我就在媒体视频里刷到一条迪拜华人商会发布的求助信息，称“有没有人从迪拜回国，可以帮忙带一些‘行李’回去，因为行李是大批的口罩，需要以行李物品的方式带回国内”。
Back at the hotel on the first night, I brushed a call for help from the Dubai Chinese Chamber of Commerce in a media video saying: "Anyone returning from Dubai can help bring some 'luggage' home because it's a large number of masks that need to be brought home in luggage."
视频信息发布者是迪拜华人商会圈内颇有名气的“董姐”。
Video information publisher is a well-known "Dong Jie" in the Dubai Chinese Chamber of Commerce circle.
我从大众传媒也得知，国内疫情有愈发严重之势，口罩等防疫物资万分告急。
I also learned from the mass media, the epidemic situation in the country has become more serious, such as masks and other epidemic prevention materials are desperate.
这种情况下，当地华侨华人都表达出了这样的爱国之情，我作为中国人，也想要尽可能提供帮助。
Under these circumstances, the local overseas Chinese have expressed such patriotic feeling, and as a Chinese, I also want to help as much as possible.
于是我给董姐留言，想了解核实一下“行李”的具体情况。
So I left a message to Dong Jie, want to check the details of "luggage".
董姐夫妻在打包物资后来，我加入了董姐建立的微信群。
Dong Jie husband and wife in packaging material later, I joined Dong Jie set up the micro-faith group.
群聊中，我得知董姐为了筹集这些援助物资，审核还挺严格的。
Group chat, I learned that Dong Jie in order to raise these materials, the audit is quite strict.
比方说，国内有哪家医院需要援助，他们会让对方先提供工作证明，还要求发送科室门口的照片等等。
For example, if there is a hospital in the country that needs assistance, they will ask the other to provide a job certificate first, and they will ask to send photos from the front door, etc.
在进一步沟通后，我了解到，当地华人已经与国内湖北省武汉市、荆州市、孝感市的多家医院联系上，与已是全国焦点的金银潭医院相比，这些医院的防护物资显得尤加匮乏。
After further communication, I learned that the local Chinese had contacted many hospitals in Wuhan, Jingzhou and Xiaogan City in Hubei Province of China, and that their protective materials were even more scarce than the gold and silver pool hospitals, which are the focus of the whole country.
董姐原先的计划是，请求旅游团队予以协助，以游客行李物品的方式将援助物资带回国内，再通过物流运送至指定医院。
Dong Jie's original plan was to ask the travel team to help by bringing the aid in the form of luggage for tourists and then shipping it through logistics to designated hospitals.
为了确定董姐的真实身份和援助物资的真实性，我还去了她家，在她家中确实看到了很多援助物资。
To ascertain Dong Jie's true identity and the authenticity of the aid, I also went to her home, where I did see a lot of aid.
我和老公原先想帮他们带30公斤左右的行李，但现在知道他们有七八个大旅行箱的物资，我就向董姐表明了自己在海关工作的身份，并问她需不需要帮忙找个物流公司空运回国。
My husband and I had wanted to help them carry around 30 kilos of luggage, but now that they had seven or eight large suitcases, I made clear to Dong Jie my status as a customs officer and asked if she needed help finding a logistics company to fly back home.
王珠凤（右）和董姐取得互相信任、达成共识后，我和老公便开启了“工作模式”。
After Wang Zhufeng (right) and Dong Jie gained mutual trust and consensus, my husband and I started the "mode of work."
我联系了自己所在的嘉定海关，并在同事们的沟通下，联系好了上海心嘉物流公司作为报关承办单位。
I contacted their own Jiading Customs, and in the communication of colleagues, contact Shanghai Xinjia Logistics Company as the customs declaration agent.
因为平时工作时有交流，知道该公司管理规范、社会诚信度好。
Because the normal working time exchanges, know the company management norms, good social integrity.
该公司第一时间也表示要向湖北献爱心，所有的运费由他们自己来承担。
The company also said the first time to Hubei to show love, all the freight costs by themselves to bear.
后续的安排如：物流公司订舱，以空运渠道运输，再通过嘉定出口加工区快速通关入境……我都全程跟进，心嘉公司也很给力。
Follow-up arrangements such as: logistics company booking, transport by air, and through the Jiading Export Processing Zone through the fast-track entry... I follow up, Xinjia company is also very strong.
由于时间紧急，为了保证所有物资的安全可靠，我和老公也帮忙做好物资装箱、统计数量、整理所需材料等事宜。
Because of the urgent time, in order to ensure the safety and security of all materials, my husband and I also help with packing materials, statistics, collation of the required materials and other matters.
仅仅2天，他们就把所有援助物资整理完毕，并协助运送机场。
In just two days, they had all the aid sorted out and assisted in the delivery of the airport.
这里还有个插曲，当我1月29日晚上上飞机的时候，董姐还电话问我，货是不是已经发出了。
Here is another episode. When I got on the plane on the evening of January 29, Dong Jie called me and asked if the goods had been delivered.
因为当天，迪拜新增了4例肺炎确诊病例。
Four new cases of pneumonia were confirmed in Dubai on the same day.
董姐说，她相信国内的疫苗研发肯定很快，等复工之后，口罩生产能力也肯定能满足需求，但如果迪拜一旦爆发，就没有口罩了，因为迪拜纯粹是进口，而且当地医疗水平也很落后。
Dong said she was confident the vaccine would be developed quickly enough to meet demand when work resumes, but that if Dubai does erupt, there will be no masks, because Dubai is a pure importer and local standards of care are poor.
她说，如果国内疫情稳定下来后，万一迪拜发生了疫情，也希望我们可以去支援他们。
'If the situation stabilizes in the country, we can support them in the event of an outbreak in Dubai, 'she said.
我深深感到，董姐为了表示海外华人的爱国情怀，这也是忍痛割爱了。
I feel deeply, Dong Jie in order to express the patriotic feeling of overseas Chinese, this is also a pain in the neck.
其实，董姐当天自己去买口罩时，就发现原本早上还卖10元人民币50个的一次性口罩，晚上就变成了50元人民币50个，而且根本买不到。
In fact, Dong Jie went to buy their own masks that day, found that the original morning also sold 10 yuan 50 disposable masks, at night into 50 yuan, and no purchase.
事实上，这次旅行，我们早在半年前就已经定了机票、定了酒店，也向单位请了假期。
As a matter of fact, we booked our tickets, booked our hotel, and asked for our holiday at work half a year ago.
这是我和老公结婚后，唯一一次两个人的旅行。
It was the only time I had traveled alone since my husband and I were married.
当时我俩觉得这次疫情是完全可以控制的，肯定最后是“虚惊一场”，所以没有取消行程，还是去了。
We felt that the outbreak was completely manageable and must have ended in a "false alarm," so we did not cancel the trip, or went.
起初我们也有过纠结和犹豫，但转念一想，这样的经历让我们这次“两人世界”变得很值得、很难忘，也很有意义。
At first we had our problems and hesitations, but on second thought, it made our "world of two" worthwhile, memorable and meaningful.
当我们跟家里老人说，将帮助海外华人实现爱心心愿、把援助物资运回国时，他们也都非常支持。
They were also very supportive when we told the old people that they would help overseas Chinese realize their loving wishes and send their aid home.
老人还让我们放心，说家里孩子都没事。
The old man reassured us that the children at home were all right.
1月30日，我和老公安全回国，现在按要求居家隔离，但我还是时刻关注着这批援助物资的动向。
My husband and I returned safely on January 30 and are now separated from my family as required, but I am still keeping an eye on the movement of this aid.
2月1日下午6点，伴随着一辆大型集卡车驶入嘉定出口加工区，这辆从浦东机场发出的货车，装着迪拜华人商会援助的70420枚口罩、20000副防护手套、护目镜等疫情防控物资，经过绿色通道迅速入境。
At 6 p.m. on 1 February, a large gathering truck entered the Jiading Export Processing Zone, a lorry from Pudong Airport with 70,420 face masks, 20,000 protective gloves, goggles and other disease-control materials assisted by the Dubai Chinese Chamber of Commerce, and entered the country quickly through the Green Channel.
一个小时后，这批物资又在心嘉物流的运送下，直奔湖北，传递爱心接力。
An hour later, the goods in Xinjia logistics delivery, straight to Hubei, passing a relay of love.
此时，我和老公的心终于定了下来。
At this point, my husband and I finally decided the heart down.
我想说，能在这么短的时间内将物资运回国，离不开大家的共同努力。
I would like to say that it is indispensable to make joint efforts to transport the materials home in such a short period of time.
