”作者 | 第一财经刘佳 王海 邱智丽“我们这里有员工符合七鲜超市的要求，不知道是否可以安排面试？”这是七鲜超市HR小蒙最近接电话听到最多的一句话。
"We have people here who meet the seven-star supermarket requirements and don't know if I can arrange an interview?"
不久前，京东7FRESH发布了“人才共享”计划，临时歇业的餐饮、酒店、影线及零售联营商户员工在此期间可以短期打工的方式加盟。
Not long ago, Jing Dong's 7 FRESH launched the "Talent Sharing" program, in which employees of temporarily closed restaurants, hotels, shadow lines, and retail chains could join on a short-term basis.
据第一财经记者不完全统计，截至目前，已有包括阿里、京东、苏宁、每日优鲜、联想等在内的科技企业发起了与传统企业共享员工的计划。
So far, technology companies, including Ali, Jingdong, Suning, Daily Premium and Lenovo, have launched plans to share staff with traditional companies, according to incomplete statistics from the first financial reporter.
有业内人士解读，“共享员工”通过提供临时就业岗位，能够迅速盘活意外赋闲在家、具有成熟业务经验的服务业人力资源，同时也尽量减少疫情对服务业、企业和员工的影响，也在一定程度上企业缓解了自身用工压力。
By providing temporary jobs, "shared employees" can quickly resuscitate human resources in the services sector who are accidentally absent from home and have mature business experience, while minimizing the impact of the epidemic on services, companies and employees, and to some extent relieving pressure on companies to use their jobs.
电话被打爆了2月3日，一张云海肴、青年餐厅员工将赴盒马“上班”的海报发出后，海报中盒马对接人马先生的电话被打爆了。
A box of horses in the poster was blown up when a poster was posted saying "go to work" to a box of horses in a crowded restaurant.
盒马原本在春节期间保留了七成的运力保证过年期间配送能力。
Boxed horses originally retained 70% of their capacity during the Spring Festival to ensure delivery capacity during the Lunar New Year.
随着疫情爆发，盒马整个需求量增长非常快。
With the outbreak, the overall demand for boxed horses grew very fast.
第一财经记者了解到，今年1月31日，盒马内部会议上就开始讨论，能否联合餐饮同仁解决更多的用工问题。
The first financial reporter understands, January 31 this year, box horse internal meeting began to discuss, can joint dining colleagues solve more problems of employment.
随后，北京盒马辗转找到云海肴，云海肴的响应也非常快，当场达成一致。
Then, Beijing boxed horse to find the clouds and siren, the response is very rapid, agreed on the spot.
第二天开始有一些员工陆续到盒马“上班”了。
The next day some employees began to "go to work" in boxes of horses.
盒马方面告诉第一财经记者，截止2月6日，已经有来自21个餐饮企业的1200余人，加入盒马临时用工队伍。
Boxer told the first financial reporter that as of February 6, more than 1,200 people from 21 catering enterprises had joined the box horse temporary labor force.
而此前疾呼“账上的现金撑不过三个月”的西贝餐饮上千员工，作为过渡期安排，也已经开始对接到当地的盒马鲜生超市工作。
The thousands of employees at Sebe, who had been crying out for "less than three months' cash on the books," are already working at the local box store, as a transitional arrangement.
与盒马类似，京东7FRESH招募的临时工种主要涉及收银、理货、拣货打包、骑手等岗位，面向相关行业假期未离开所在城市、具有健康证的员工。
Similar to Boxer, the temporary workers recruited by Jing Dong 7 FRESH mainly involve the posts of cashier, tallyman, pick-up, rider, etc., and are geared to employees with health certificates who do not leave their cities during the holidays.
据第一财经记者了解，截止目前，已有酒武居酒屋、赵崽儿、阿铭哥牛肉面、Shawarma酷稻、小鹤食堂、大洋世家等十余家餐饮企业员工前往报到上班。
According to the first financial reporter, so far, there have been liquor houses, Zhao son, Amingo beef noodle, Shawarma Cool Rice, Crane Cafeteria, Ocean Family and other employees of more than a dozen catering enterprises to report to work.
“累一点没关系，只要能每天工作，我很安心。
"It doesn't matter to be tired. I feel at ease as long as I can work everyday.
现在就是希望疫情早点过去，一切多会好起来的。
Now is the hope that the epidemic will be over, everything will be better.
”本是小鹤食堂的促销员刘永海说。
"said Liu Yonghai, a salesman in the Little Crane Canteen.
他加入了七鲜超市廊坊万向城店果蔬组，疫情期间蔬菜需求激增，这是每天工作量最大的部门。
He joined the Langfang Wanchai fruit and vegetable section of the Seven-Fresh Supermarket, the biggest daily load of vegetables during the outbreak.
不止是生鲜平台，2月7日，苏宁物流也发布“人才共享”计划，面向因疫情冲击，工作受到短暂影响的人群，提供各类仓内分拣、包装，社区骑手、快递配送等工作岗位。
On Feb. 7, Suning Logistics launched the Talent Sharing Program, which targets people whose jobs have been temporarily affected by the epidemic, offering jobs in warehouse sorting, packaging, community riders and express delivery.
而围绕制造业，疫情当前，不少中小制造企业因疫情影响延期开工或开业，生产经营遭遇难题。
Around the manufacturing industry, the current epidemic, many small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises because of the impact of the epidemic postponed or opened, production and operation encountered difficulties.
2月8日，联想公布将提供包括电脑、服务器、手机的组装、包装等临时工作机会，涉及城市包括武汉、合肥、深圳、惠阳、成都，帮助中小企业扛过困难期。
On Feb. 8, Lenovo announced it would offer temporary jobs, including computers, servers, cell phones, assembly and packaging in cities including Wuhan, Hefei, Shenzhen, Huiyang and Chengdu, to help small and medium-sized enterprises cope with difficult times.
“尤其是一些不具备防疫抗毒能力的小工厂，强行开工风险太大，来联想干一段，保存实力和队伍，扛过这一段，再谋未来。
"In particular, some small factories that do not have the ability to prevent the virus, forced work is too risky, Lenovo paragraph to save strength and team, carry this paragraph, and then look for the future.
”一位联想人士说。
'said one Lenovo.
共享员工会成趋势吗？除了企业之间互相调配人力资源之外，为了解决员工待岗和企业缺工问题，也有第三方劳动力平台推出了类似服务。
Apart from transferring human resources between companies, third-party labor platforms offer similar services to address employee layoffs and job shortages.
据记者了解，劳动力综合管理解决方案服务商喔趣科技推出了“员工共享平台”，专门针对有闲置人员和用工需求的企业提供对接服务。
According to the reporter, comprehensive labor management solutions service provider Oh fun technology launched "staff sharing platform," specifically targeting idle personnel and the need to provide docking services.
截止目前在该平台上已经参与共享的员工有6825位，主要集中于餐饮、零售、酒店、物业、物流、制造业等劳动密集型行业，企业属性聚焦在连锁门店10家店以上或人口规模200人以上。
So far, 6,825 employees have participated in the platform, mainly in the catering, retail, hotel, property, logistics, manufacturing and other labor-intensive industries, the attributes of which focus on chain stores more than 10 stores or a population of more than 200 people.
喔趣科技相关负责人告诉第一财经，共享员工不仅是一种应急措施，更是未来用工的趋势。
Oh, technology-related officials told First Finance that sharing employees is not only an emergency measure, but also a trend of future employment.
对于提供方而言，共享用工模式使得用人成本被分摊，解决企业现金流压力。
For suppliers, the shared employment model allows for the allocation of staff costs and addresses corporate cash flow pressures.
对于需求方而言，满足用工方短时间内大量用工需求，解决紧缺人问题。
For the demand side, to meet a short period of large-scale labor demand, to solve the shortage of people.
至于共享员工的具体用工方式、薪酬等问题，记者了解到，盒马对于人工的结算方式，会根据与每家企业签订的协议，足额支付报酬。
As for the sharing of staff specific ways of employment, remuneration, the reporter learned that the box horse for the mode of manual settlement, will be signed with each enterprise, the full payment of the agreement.
盒马全国经营管理总经理胡秋根表示，盒马与餐企员工的合作，不是新型雇佣关系，而是临时的过度措施。
Hu Qiugen, general manager of Boxer's National Business Administration, said the boxed horse's collaboration with its catering staff was not a new type of employment relationship but a temporary transitional measure.
而京东7FRESH也给每一个新员工提供了全面的福利待遇，除了提供具有竞争力的薪资，还为员工购买“新冠”特别保险。
And Beijing-East 7 FRESH offers every new employee a comprehensive package of benefits, offering a competitive salary as well as special coverage for the new crown.
不过，新的用工模式给企业也带来一定的挑战，提供方会担忧员工风险问题，例如疫情期间员工出现被感染问题，医药费用如何承担。
However, the new employment model also poses challenges for companies, with providers concerned about employee risks, such as how employees are infected during the epidemic and how the cost of medicines is covered.
同时也会担忧员工流失问题。
There are also concerns about employee attrition.
此外，对于需求方而言会担忧技能匹配问题，可能存在跨行业用工，没办法立即上岗问题。
In addition, there are concerns about skill matches on the demand side, and there may be cross-practice workers who are unable to take up positions immediately.
以制造业为例，一位从业人士告诉记者，理论上这些新工人经过培训，一个月成为熟练工，然后一个月干活，假设疫情结束了，再一个月就都走了，对工厂的产能有一定影响，但眼下，只有一起并肩作战才能共克时艰。
In manufacturing, for example, one practitioner told reporters that the new workers were theoretically trained to become skilled workers for a month and then work for a month. Assuming the epidemic was over and a month later, it would have an impact on the plant's capacity, but for now it would be difficult to work together.
