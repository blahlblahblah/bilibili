在向民众派发现金方面，参议院提出，不缴纳联邦税的人仅能获得600美元，2018年调整后年收入在7.5万美元以上的人将无法获得这项补助。
In terms of cash transfers to the public, the Senate proposed that those who do not pay federal taxes would receive only $600, which would not be available to those earning more than $75,000 in 2018 adjusted annual income.

“一旦国会通过了这个计划，我们将在三周内完成发放。
"Once the plan is approved by Congress, we'll have it out in three weeks.
接下来，如果六周后，美国仍处在全国紧急情况下，我们将再向每人发放3000美元，”姆努钦说。
Then, if, six weeks later, the United States is still in a national emergency, we will pay another $3,000 to each, "he said.
不过这一计划可能在国会遭到反对。
But the plan may meet with opposition in Congress.
据CNBC报道，参议院少数党领袖查克·舒默（Chuck Schumer）就表示，仅仅发放一两次现金支票，无法为那些丢掉工作的人提供足够的支持，他认为应该提高并扩大失业险，后者将为美国人提供更长时间的保障。
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, for one or two months, says that cash checks alone won't provide enough support for those who lose their jobs. He says unemployment insurance should be increased and expanded to provide longer-term protection for Americans.
