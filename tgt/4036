本文是协作者在“农民工抗疫救援行动”中，针对困境农民工家庭开展的个案访谈之一，旨在快速识别疫情中的脆弱人群及其需求，为疫情防控和救援工作提供参考，我们整理出来与你分享。
This article is one of the case interviews conducted by the co-authors in the "Anti-epidemic Rescue Operation for Migrant Workers," which aims to identify the vulnerable people and their needs in the epidemic quickly, and to provide reference for prevention, control and rescue work.
疫情下的深呼吸——困境农民工家庭个案实录（四）想着过个安生的年口述者：米粒（化名）打工所在地：北京编者注：米粒，52岁，原本在张家口农村老家跑摩的为生，丈夫遭遇交通事故导致胃底大出血而到北京手术，之后孩子也查出病毒性心肌炎和血小板无力症，一家人只能在北京边打工边求医。
(4) A Case Study of Families of Migrant Workers in Distress (Part IV): A Happy Year Oral Person: Beijing Editor's Note: Rice, 52 years old, used to live in his hometown of Zhangjiakou, her husband suffered from a traffic accident and went to Beijing for surgery.
米粒常年扛着家庭重担，以捡垃圾和摆摊卖文具为生，自己也是疾病缠身。
The rice grain carries the heavy burden of the family all year round, lives by picking up garbage and selling stationery, and is also sick.
面对命运，她努力让自己学会接纳和感恩。
Facing her fate, she tries to let herself learn to accept and be grateful.
都是命呗，放过别人也是放过自己2012年1月，我和孩子她爸第一次来北京，给他做胃底大出血手术。
Is the life, let go of others is also let off their own January 2012, my child and her father came to Beijing for the first time, for his stomach bleeding surgery.
2012年5月，孩子得了病毒性心肌炎，我再次带她来北京看病。
In May 2012, the child had viral myocarditis and I took her to Beijing again.
我们两人之前在老家是跑摩的。
We were both running back home.
因病致贫，为了在北京给孩子看病能有收入生存下去，2013年开始断断续续摆地摊、捡垃圾为生。
As a result of illness, in order to give children access to health care income to survive in Beijing, in 2013 began intermittently stalls, garbage collection for a living.
家里收入我算不出来，很多记不住了。
I can't figure out the family income. I can't remember much.
在老家办的低保户，每月发给我们家700元，政府每年给20斤大米，几桶麻油，过年还给200块钱的煤。
The low-income families in their hometown are paid 700 yuan a month. The government gives 20 jin of rice, a few barrels of sesame oil every year, and 200 yuan of coal in the coming year.
孩子（领养的孤儿）有孤儿救助，还办了特困户，虽然不能定期发钱，但是能报销医院开的医药费单子，药店买的药无法报销。
The children (adopted orphans) were assisted by orphans and special hardship cases were set up. Although they could not be paid regularly, they were reimbursed for their hospital bills and medicines purchased by pharmacies were not reimbursed.
捡破烂也不是天天有，得攒几天才能卖20/30元钱。
Ragged up is not every day, have to save a few days to sell 20 / 30 yuan.
吃喝是从老家带的米面，基本不咋花钱。
Food and drink from the home of rice noodles, basically do not spend money.
房租1千出头，屋里没有暖气，我们自己买的煤，偷偷点的炉子，孩子学费一学期3千多元。
The rent was just over a thousand, there was no heating, we bought our own coal, we secretly ordered stoves, and the children's tuition was more than 3,000 yuan a semester.
▲ 2017年冬季，协作者社会工作者了解米粒家里的生活情况2011年12月孩子他爸跑摩的的时候被三轮车给撞伤了，一开始他不觉得难受，拖了几天，后来吃饭也不怎么样了，牙齿鼻子还出血，大便也不好了。
In the winter of 2017, the collaborator's social worker learned about the family's life when his father was hit by a tricycle in December 2011 while he was running more than a few days. At first, he did not feel bad.
医生检查说是胃底大出血，挺危险的，住进医院人家就不让他动了，就开始输血，半夜病危通知书就下来了。
The doctor said that the stomach bleeding is very dangerous, resident in the hospital will not allow him to move, began a blood transfusion, midnight critically ill notification down.
2个学佛的佛友帮我带孩子，我拿着家里所有的存款带他来北京治病了，后来把房产证也抵押贷款。
Two buddhist buddhs helped me with my children. I brought him to Beijing with all my family's savings and took him to Beijing for medical treatment.
在北京协和医院输了两天液止住血了，医生建议是要做手术，我们又跑到302医院给他做手术，切除了一部分胃还有食道管。
After losing two days of fluid loss at the Beijing Concorde Hospital to stop the bleeding, the doctor advised an operation, and we went to hospital 302 to operate on him, removing a portion of his stomach and esophagus tube.
手术后孩子他爸就基本丧失了劳动能力。
After the operation, the child's father basically lost his ability to work.
手术及治疗费花了11万，每天几千元的住院费，住了40天院。
The operation and treatment cost 110,000 yuan a day to stay in hospital for 40 days.
跑摩的攒的几万块钱都花光了，还借了5、6万。
He ran out of tens of thousands of dollars he had saved and borrowed fifty or sixty thousand.
我到现在也没有去找那个肇事者，那家人都不知道这个事。
I haven't been able to find the culprit, and the family doesn't know about it.
我到现在还是觉得让一家不好过，找了他们的话就是两家人不好过了，农村人十来万块钱让他赔偿他也拿不出。
I still feel to make a family difficult, find their words is that the two families are difficult, rural people to pay him 100000 dollars can not give him.
我就自己扛下来了，我想的是，也许她爸早就有病，但是一直没发现，然后被车撞了一下就引发大出血了，所以就想着自己的事自己承担吧。
I just carried it off myself, And I thought maybe her dad was sick, But he didn't see it, And then he got hit by a car And it started bleeding, So just think about your own business.
如果打官司的话，老公病着，孩子也病着，家里也没其他人，可能打到无休止了，还不如我自己发个善心，别再纠缠了呢。
If the case against her husband is sick, the child is sick, there is no one else in the family, it may be endless, it is better for me to have a good heart of my own and stop pestering it.
都是命呗，放过别人也是放过自己。
Is the life, let go of others is also let off their own.
我觉得我这么想也是对的，因为后来我们孩子看病也是有志愿者、有好人捐款啥的，社会好心人也多。
I think I was right to think so, because later our children to see the doctor is also volunteers, there are good people to donate and so on, there are more people in society.
妈妈，回老家我就没命了2012年3月开始，我的孩子连着两个月高烧不退，在老家医院检查说是因为感冒时间长了，感染了病毒性心肌炎。
Mom, I'm gonna die back home In March 2012, my baby had a high fever for two months, And I checked in my hometown hospital Because of a long cold, contracted viral myocarditis.
当时家里给他爸爸看病已经负债几万，没办法我又借了1000块钱，背着孩子再次来到北京。
At that time, the family to his father to see the doctor has tens of thousands of debt, I could not borrow another 1000 yuan, carrying the children back to Beijing.
检查结果说是病毒性心肌炎，在儿童医院的心内科，住了一个礼拜，孩子老家学校的校长帮我们找了捐款方，捐赠了7千元帮我们度过难关。
It turned out to be viral myocarditis. After spending a week in the department of cardiology at the Children's Hospital, the principal of our home school helped us find a donor and donated 7,000 yuan to help us tide over the difficulties.
▲ 米粒的孩子画的图画（拍摄于2019年8月）后来孩子又检查出血小板无力症，2012到2013年一直是大伙儿给我们捐钱治病的，花了不少，但具体让我算我算不出来是多少钱了。
The picture drawn by the rice-grain child (taken in August 2019) was followed by the child's detection of thrombocytopenia, which cost us a lot of money from 2012 to 2013, but let me count how much money I can't count.
后来医院说是要做骨髓移植才能根治，需要几十万元，数目太大就无能为力了，但我还是挺感恩人家帮助我们。
Later the hospital said to do bone marrow transplant can be radical cure, the need for hundreds of thousands of dollars, the number is too large to do nothing, but I am very grateful to others to help us.
骨髓配型后来也找到了，因为没有钱，就没做成骨髓移植。
The matching bone marrow was later found because there was no money and there was no bone marrow transplant.
孩子哭了我也哭了，她说：“妈妈，回老家我就没命了，就在这保守治疗吧”。
The child cried I also cried, she said: "Mom, I will die back home, right here conservative treatment."
我当时打着小时工，一天能挣50块钱。
I was working part-time and making fifty dollars a day.
当时我们娘俩在地下室住一个床，白天棉袄是我的衣服，晚上棉袄是我的被子。
The two of us were living in a bed in the basement. The padded jacket was my dress during the day and my quilt at night.
我打小时工解决房租和生活费，孩子保守治疗的钱是好心人捐赠的。
I worked part-time to pay the rent and living expenses, and the money for the child's conservative treatment was donated by good people.
但是我干小时工一走就是半天，孩子放在地下室里没有人管。
But I worked part-time, and the kids were left unattended in the basement.
她就说“妈妈你卖玩具吧，我帮你进货。
She said, "Mom, you sell toys. I'll get you some.
”所以我就开始背着孩子进货卖玩具，挣钱了给孩子买了个轮椅推着她去进货。
"So I began to carry my children on my back and sell toys, so I made money and bought a wheelchair for my child and wheeled her to the store.
后来孩子又病情加重，政府给了一万块钱看病，后来又给我们办的低保，过年慰问金啥的能有几百块也挺好，还有20斤大米、几桶麻油、200块钱的煤，年年给，我也挺高兴，因为以前这些也都没有。
Later, the child became seriously ill, the government gave ten thousand dollars to see the doctor, then we run a low-income Bao, the New Year's consolation money can have hundreds of dollars is also good, as well as 20 jin of rice, a few barrels of sesame oil, 200 yuan of coal, given year after year, because none of these had happened before.
我们现在也办上了特困户，我做椎管狭窄和胆囊切除手术住了两次院，自己自费的也不多，国家也帮助了挺多的，基本维持了生活，我们自己再劳动一点，基本就过来了。
We now have SHC families, I have had spinal stenosis and cholecystectomy two times, my own self-pay is not much, the state has helped quite a lot, basically maintain life, we work a little more, basically came over.
现在孩子的病情还能控制住，只要不感冒不发烧就行。
Now the child's illness can still be controlled, as long as the cold does not have a fever.
但是一想起以后的日子我就发愁了，孩子18岁以后国家就不管了。
But the thought of the days that followed worried me, leaving the country when the child was 18 years old.
低保三口人一个月一共发700元，孩子补助走的救济款，特困证不是定期给我们发放补贴的，就是住院能给你报销药费。
The minimum income of three people a month a total of 700 yuan, the child allowance away from the relief, special hardship certificate is not to us on a regular basis, or you can be hospitalized to reimburse the drug costs.
2018年我做了椎管狭窄的手术，但是恢复不怎么样。
I had surgery for spinal stenosis in 2018, but my recovery was poor.
2019年11月份又做了胆囊切除手术，颈椎疼也变得厉害了，现在又添了更年期综合征，每天胡思乱想，大脑疼，情绪也控制不住，难受起来自己控制不了都想自杀解脱。
Cholecystectomy was performed in November 2019 and the pain in the cervical spine has become severe, now with menopausal syndromes, daily crannies, brain pains, uncontrollable emotions, and uncontrollable suicide.
医院说我是抑郁症，建议我去安定医院和第六医院看看。
The hospital said I was depressed and advised me to go to the stable hospital and the sixth hospital.
去年冬天我啥也不能干，我爱人摆地摊伺候我，他见我病的挺厉害，他自己也精神崩溃了3次，现在自己时不时去医院开点睡觉安神的药，吃着药，心烦、情绪能基本控制住一些，现在就是吃点药养着呗。
I couldn't do anything last winter, and my lover sat on his hands and waited on me. He saw that I was very ill and that he himself had broken down three times. Now he went to the hospital now and then to prescribe some sleeping pills, take some medicine, get upset, get a little emotional control, and now he is just taking some medicine.
想着先过个安生的年，过一天算一天腊月十一，也就是2020年的1月5日，我回老家报药费来着，不知道能报下来多少，钱还没到账呢。
I want to live a happy life, day after day, the eleventh day of January, 2020, that is, January 5, 2020, I back home reported drug fees, I do not know how much can report, the money has not arrived.
腊月二十九回到北京，我在老家期间不知道这个事（新型冠状病毒肺炎），回北京之后孩子告诉我的，她天天关注这个，也不出门，就是学习，在家里休息。
Back in Beijing on the 29th of February, I did not know about this (new coronavirus pneumonia) when I returned to Beijing, the children told me that she paid attention to this day, does not go out, is to study, at home rest.
我们知道现在这个疫情第一是不出门，不接触就传染不到；第二是多开窗通风。
We know that the current epidemic is first of all, do not go out, do not contact, the second is multi-window ventilation.
我们家只有两个N95口罩，酒精和消毒液也没有。
We only have two N95 masks and no alcohol or disinfectant.
我从老家回来拿的土豆、干菜、白菜、粉条、豆腐干啥的，还有20斤大米、2斤麻油、面、肉、猪下水，我还在北京腌了咸菜、酸菜，反正够吃两个月的。
I got potatoes, dried vegetables, cabbage, powder and tofu from my hometown. I also got 20 jin of rice, 2 jin of sesame oil, noodles, meat and pork, and pickled pickles and pickled cabbage in Beijing.
我们现在住的房子离武警医院比较近，是个大院，我住在楼道口，没听到（社区）广播，只见到周围贴了通知，就是说如何防护以及外地人回来怎么登记啥的，没见他们广播和喷消毒液。
The house we are living in is a large compound near the Carabineros Hospital. I live in the hallway and I don't hear the [community] radio. I see notices on the outside, that is, how to protect and how to register people coming back. They don't broadcast and spray disinfectant.
现在不敢串门、晚上没人时才出去扔垃圾，回来就及时洗手洗脸。
Do not dare to visit the door, at night when no one out to throw garbage, back on time wash their hands and face.
我爱人因为做过胃部切除手术，吃完饭必须得在院子里走两圈，才能消化。
My wife had to walk around the yard two times after dinner because she had a gastrectomy to digest it.
我网上看到有人散步也可能传播肺炎，我和孩子重视，虽然不是害怕，但是也得预防着。
I see people walking on the Internet may also spread pneumonia, my children and I pay attention, although not afraid, but also to prevent.
我爱人大大咧咧的，不咋在乎，但是也跟他说了，他也知道。
My wife is careless, do not care much, but also told him, he also know.
▲ 米粒家的出租屋（拍摄于2019年8月）2003年非典时我们还在老家跑摩的，村里发消毒液，家里天天喷，我感觉那时戒严的比现在严，交通管制什么的，好像非典过去的还挺快。
Rice Hire House (August 2019) In 2003 when SARS we were running home, the village issued disinfectant, the family spray, I feel martial than now, traffic control and so on, as if SARS had been quite fast.
现在这个不知道多久能过去。
I don't know how long this is going to pass.
2月17 号前后，我得去北大一院去做更年期的检查，妇产科和综合科的已经交了费了，花了4千多，得做好多检查，还有心理科的检查。
Around February 17, I had to go to a Peking University courtyard for menopause checkups. Gynecology, Obstetrics and Gynecology and General Studies have paid for more than 4,000 check-ups and psychological check-ups.
调整更年期综合征的药这一星期也快吃完了，还不知道因为这个病能不能出去买。
Adjust the menopause syndrome medicine this week is also running out, do not know because the disease can go out to buy.
家里备用的感冒药、咳嗽药也不多了，一般都是去半壁店医院开的，现在也不敢去。
Home spare cold medicine, cough medicine is not much, usually to half the shop hospital opened, now also afraid to go.
我们没有经济支持，谁都是救急不救穷。
We do not have financial support, no one is urgent to help poor people.
现在因为疫情摆摊摆不了，家里还有点文具的货。
Now because of the epidemic spread can not put in place, home is still a bit of stationery goods.
捡废品也因为现在病毒挺厉害的，说不能掏垃圾桶。
Scrap collection because the virus is now quite fierce, said not to pick up the garbage can.
之前捡的瓶子还没卖，在外面放着呢。
The bottles that were found before have not been sold. They are on the outside.
我以前的事都不敢想了，一想就活不下去了。
I was afraid to think about things before, so I couldn't live any longer.
孩子一天天长大，她身体不好，我们也不能照顾她一辈子，越想越害怕，只能顺其自然了。
Children grow up, she is not healthy, we can not take care of her life, more and more afraid, can only let it go.
现在她上初二，但是初三，也就是2020年冬天，就得计划回老家找学校，她的学籍一直在老家。
Now she's in her second year of junior high, but in the third day of junior high, in the winter of 2020, she has to plan to go back to school.
我们老家是土房子，因为我爱人生病了家里没劳力，房子漏雨，房梁也断了，我自己给它包了一根梁。
Our hometown is a clay house, because my wife sick home no labor, leaking house, broken beam, I wrapped a beam for it.
去年秋天我回老家跟县里申请了公租房，不知道能不能批下来，不知道能不能照顾我们公租房少交点钱。
Last autumn I returned to my hometown and the county to apply for public rental housing, I do not know if it can be approved down, I do not know whether we can take care of public rental less money.
我怕我孩子如果明年回去上学了，没房子住。
I'm afraid my child won't have a house if he goes back to school next year.
她爸爸的身体一直是我照顾着，我干重活儿他干轻活儿，我压力大，他压力轻，生活的担子他担不动。
Her father's body has always been my care, I do heavy work He does light work, I am stressed, he is light pressure, he can not bear the burden of life.
家里困难大，反正好多事都压在我身上，很多超出了我的能力。
The family is difficult, anyway a lot of things on me, many beyond my ability.
我劝我自己，过去的过去了，未来的不想，我用药控制我的情绪稳定，晚上能睡着觉，就想着先过个安生的年，过一天算一天。
I advised myself that the past is over, the future does not want, I control my mood stability with medication, can sleep at night, just want to live a peaceful life, day after day.
社会工作者手记米粒长年累月照顾生病的丈夫和孩子，并担负着家庭生计，访谈中，我们随时都能感受到她异常的烦忧和焦虑。
The social worker keeps a diary of her long years of caring for her sick husband and children and supporting her family, and we can feel her unusual worries and anxieties all the time.
这不是她想要的生活，面对现实的和长远的困难的压迫，她只能在自己心理和身体所能承受的范围之内，一天天一点点的去接纳，去解决。
It was not the kind of life she wanted to live, to face the pressures of reality and long-term hardship, and she could only accept and deal with it little by little, day by day, within her own mental and physical reach.
即使生活如此艰辛，她还是尽量体恤着周围的人：原谅给自己家庭带来变故的肇事者；对给予自己帮助的人充满感激……访谈结束，放下电话的那一刻，社会工作者如释重负。
Even though life was so difficult, she tried to be compassionate with those around her: Forgive the perpetrator of the accident to her family; be grateful to those who helped her... The interview was over, and the moment the call was over, the social worker was relieved.
