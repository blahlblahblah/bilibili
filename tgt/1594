苹果有两个降压体系：线上和应用商店软件销售。
Apple has two pressure-relief systems: online and app store software sales.
但这二者均不足以完全抵消疫情带来的短期压力文 |王凤编辑 | 谢丽容苹果受新冠肺炎的影响越来越明显。
But neither is enough to fully offset the short-term pressures of the epidemic. & # 160; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
2月18日，苹果公司宣布，受疫情影响，全球iPhone供应紧张，此前发布的第二财季的营收目标630-670亿美元无法实现。
On Feb. 18, Apple announced that global iPhone supplies were tight because of the epidemic, and it had previously announced revenue targets of $63 billion to $67 billion for the second quarter.
消息一出，苹果（AAPL.O）股价应声下跌，盘前跌超4%。
Shares of Apple fell by more than 4 per cent before trading, according to the news.
截至18日美国股市收盘，股价下跌1.83%。
US stocks closed down 1.83 per cent on the 18th.
市值跌落1.4万亿美元。
Market value fell $1.4 trillion.
苹果公司中国制造合作伙伴均在湖北之外，仍然不同程度受到冲击。
Apple's Chinese manufacturing partners are outside Hubei and are still being hit to varying degrees.
最先受疫情冲击的是体验店。
The first to be hit by the epidemic was the experiential store.
早在2月1日，苹果公司宣布关闭所有中国大陆零售店至2月9日24时，但直2月18日也没有完全恢复营业。
As early as February 1, Apple closed all mainland Chinese retail stores until 2400 hours on February 9, but did not fully resume operations until February 18.
2月18日，库克在向员工发表的备忘录中坦言，“（中国）专卖店开始恢复营业，恢复正常状态的速度低于预期”。
In a memo to his staff on Feb. 18, Cook admitted: "The stores are starting to reopen at a slower pace than expected."
疫情仍在持续，阻止人们进出零售店，苹果各渠道和体验店存货积压。
The epidemic continues, preventing people from going into and out of retail stores, Apple channels and experiential stores.
生产方面，分布于大陆各省份的代工厂复工时间的不确定性，一步一步传导至生产线，进一步影响手机出货量。
On the production side, the uncertainty of the resumption of work time in the mainland's provinces, step-by-step transmission to the production line, further affecting the volume of mobile phone shipments.
承接全球90%iPhone订单的富士康郑州园区，已于2月10日复工，但复工率仅约40-60%。
Foxconn's Zhengzhou Park, which took over 90% of the world's iPhone orders, resumed work on February 10, but only about 40% to 60%.
“从人性角度来说，每个员工都害怕。
"From a human perspective, every employee is afraid.
”一位富士康的内部主管对《财经》记者说，“你在大街上，看谁都像疑似患者”。
One Foxconn executive told Caijing: "You're on the street, you look like everybody's a suspect."
冲击波很可能继续扩散。
The shock wave is likely to continue spreading.
苹果数百个供应链背后的硬件制造商，为上百万人提供生计。
The hundreds of hardware manufacturers behind Apple's hundreds of supply chains provide livelihoods for millions of people.
一部iPhone要经700人的手，400个制造工序，是普通手机的十倍。
The iPhone takes 700 hands and 400 manufacturing processes, ten times the size of a regular cell phone.
这向来集中体现了iPhone的精密与严谨之美。
This has always epitomized the precision and rigour of the iPhone.
现在，iPhone产线上的工人聚集与长时间接触，是新冠肺炎防护的大忌。
Now, workers on the iPhone's production line congregate for extended periods of time, a major deterrent to new crown pneumonia.
苹果不得不为数百万工人的安全，放缓供应链条各个部分的机械运转节奏，甚至加速供应链调整步伐。
Apple has had to slow down the mechanical tempo of parts of the supply chain and even accelerate the pace of supply chain adjustments for the safety of millions of workers.
一定时间内，消费者消费热情减退、不能保证的复工率、iPhone中国供应链各环节暂时停摆等问题，持续拷问苹果。
For some time, Apple continued to be grilled about consumer enthusiasm waning, uncertain rework rates, and the temporary stoppage of various links in the iPhone's China supply chain.
2月18日，库克称“疫情对苹果的影响将是暂时的”，但真实情况或许不那么乐观。
On Feb. 18, Cook said "the impact of the epidemic on Apple will be temporary," but the real situation may be less optimistic.
卖不出去、产不出来的iPhone复工难带来生产难，复业难带来销售难。
Unsold and unproduced iPhones have struggled to get back to work, making it difficult to get back to work.
两难。
Dilemma.
疫情首先影响的是苹果在全国各个城市的42家零售店。
The epidemic initially affected 42 retail outlets in various cities across the country.
2月1日，苹果公司关闭所有中国大陆零售店。
On February 1, Apple closed all mainland Chinese retail stores.
2月10日以来，苹果零售店的复苏情况并不乐观。
Since February 10, the recovery at Apple's retail stores has not been encouraging.
苹果（中国）官网显示，北京三里屯、朝阳大悦城等商圈的5家零售店，营业时间为11:00-18:00（正常营业时间为10:00-22:00），这是苹果所有中国零售店在疫情期间的营业时间，全天仅营业7个小时。
Five retail outlets in the Sanlitun, Chaoyang Yue Shopping Mall in Beijing are open from 11: 00 to 18: 00 (normal business hours: 10: 00-22: 00), according to Apple's official website.
上海7家苹果零售店，除南京东路和香港广场零售店外，剩余5家零售店均显示关闭，关闭时间延续到2月24日。
All but five of the seven retail outlets in Shanghai, except Nanjing East Road and Hong Kong Plaza, were closed until 24 February.
位于成都、南京等地的零售店则一律关闭。
Retail stores in Chengdu, Nanjing and other places are closed.
除了苹果嫡系的零售店，分布于全国各地的授权零售商、下沉到县镇的代理商也受到不同程度打击。
In addition to Apple's direct retail stores, authorized retailers across the country, agents sinking down to county towns, have been hit to varying degrees.
四川南充的李为民运营的线下手机连锁店年销售额过亿，苹果也是李为民连锁店的重要产品。
Li in Nanchong, Sichuan, runs a $100 million-a-year-old chain of mobile phone chains, and Apple is an important product for Li's chain.
春节坚持开业，但顾客寥寥无几，“往年单日至少600台，如今缩水到不够100台”。
Spring Festival insists on opening, but few customers, "in previous years at least 600 a day, has shrunk to less than 100."
河北的手机零售商王立此前也向《财经》记者传递悲观预期，“原本可以赚3倍于平日的春节没有了，第一季度销量将下降四分之三”。
Wang Li, a handset retailer in Hebei, also told Caijing earlier this week that "the Spring Festival, which could have made three times as much money as usual, will lose three quarters of its sales in the first quarter."
“我们从各个地市、县乡镇收上来的数字惨不忍睹”，第三方数据机构GFK分析师宗清楷向《财经》记者透露，“一季度全靠春节档，春节没什么销量”，整个一季度面临巨大挑战。
"The figures we collect from cities, counties and cities are appalling," Zong Qingkai, an analyst with GFK, a third-party data organization, told Caijing. "The first quarter was a Spring Festival holiday with few sales," he told Caijing.
这是国内手机厂商普遍面临的问题。
This is a common problem faced by domestic mobile phone manufacturers.
需求端的触点被疫情人为阻断，未能全面复苏，年前就备好的库存持续积压。
Demand-side contacts were artificially blocked by the outbreak, and there was no full recovery, with stockpiles built up a year ago accumulating.
此外，供应端的复工率，也成为拉低iPhone预期出货量的一大掣肘。
In addition, the supply side of the resumption of work, has become a drag on the expected volume of iPhone shipments.
苹果宣布疫情让全球iPhone供应紧张，影响全球营收，并不夸张。
It is no exaggeration to say that Apple's announcement is straining global iPhone supplies and harming global revenue.
出货量背后，是包括富士康、和硕在内的各大代工厂的流水线员工的复工难。
Behind the volume of shipments, including Foxconn, Asus and other major factories of the assembly line workers are difficult to return to work.
目前，他们不是在复工的路上，就是处于复工后的隔离观察期（14天），有一部分还在家中待命。
At present, they are either on their way back to work or are under quarantine (14 days) once they return to work, some of whom are still on standby at home.
很少有地方复工率过50%。
Few places have returned to work above 50 per cent.
以鸿海科技集团（下称“鸿海”）为例。
Take Hon Hai Technology Group (Hon Hai) as an example.
苹果在中国最大的代工商——鸿海的iPhone生产主要集中在富士康郑州、深圳和太原，另有少部分产能在印度。
Apple's iPhone production at Hon Hai, China's largest contract maker, is concentrated in Foxconn, Shenzhen and Taiyuan, with a small amount of capacity in India.
上述富士康主管告诉《财经》记者，企业压力很大，最担心的是员工不足问题。
The head of Foxconn told Caijing that companies were under a lot of pressure and the biggest concern was the shortage of staff.
富士康郑州主要负责生产iPhone 11 系列、iPhone SE2等。
Foxconn is in charge of producing the iPhone 11 and the iPhone SE2.
为激励甚至留住正式员工，富士康郑州于2月15日推出了“防疫返岗激励奖”——负责iPhone生产的iDPBG（数位产品事业群，integrated Digital Product Business Group）郑州的在职员工返岗将获得3000元奖励。
To motivate and even retain staff, Foxconn launched the Foxconn Anti-epidemic Incentive Award on Feb. 15 - a 3,000-yuan reward for returning to work in Zhengzhou for the iPhone's iPBG (digital product business group, integrated Digital Product Business Group).
早到多干者得，晚到少干者无。
He who arrives early gets what he does late.
往常，此时是富士康火爆的招工季节，疫情带来的不确定性，火爆场面不再。
Normally, this is the Foxconn hot recruitment season, the outbreak of uncertainty, the fiery scene no longer.
富士康郑州iDPBG事业群的一位负责季节工招聘的员工告诉《财经》记者，目前郑州富士康只招收有郑州户籍的员工，直接上岗。
Foxconn, a seasonal worker recruiter for Foxconn's iDPBG business group, told Caijing that at present, Foxconn in Zhengzhou only accepts employees with Zhengzhou household registration to work directly.
其他户籍人员暂时不面试。
Other household registration staff will not be interviewed.
短期劳动力缺口变大。
The short-term labor gap has widened.
此前，路透社援引知情人士消息称，富士康董事长刘扬伟设定的内部目标是，2月底恢复大陆半数产能，三月份恢复80%产能。
Earlier, Reuters quoted people familiar with the matter as saying Foxconn chairman Liu Yangwei set an internal target of restoring half of the mainland's capacity by the end of February and 80 per cent in March.
为保证复工，深圳富士康龙华园区甚至导入了口罩生产线。
To ensure the resumption of work, Shenzhen Foxconn Longhua Park even introduced a mask production line.
但负责口罩生产的工业富联的一位员工对《财经》记者说，所在部门复工率不足20%。
But an WFTI employee in charge of mask production told Caijing that the department had a return to work rate of less than 20 percent.
苹果的其他代工厂的复工情况也难言乐观。
The resumption of work at Apple's other subcontracting plants is also difficult to say.
天风证券分析师郭明錤2月9日发布报告称，苹果的另一大代工厂和硕已在2月3日复工，复工率90%。
Guo Mingzhu, an analyst at Tianfeng Securities, said in a report released Feb. 9 that another major Apple plant and Asus had resumed work on February 3, with a resumption rate of 90%.
但预估2月发薪后会有离职潮，复工率会下降至60--70%。
However, it is expected that there will be a wave of departures after February's payroll, with the return rate falling to 60-70 per cent.
原计划2月10日复工的和硕昆山，又推迟数日，复工率仅为40-60%。
The planned resumption of work on 10 February in Hashuosukunshan has been delayed for a few days, with a resumption rate of only 40-60 per cent.
难产，又难卖，这确实是苹果目前面临的一大难题。
Difficult labor, and difficult to sell, is a real challenge for Apple.
但这是苹果独自面对的问题吗？显然不是。
But is this a problem for Apple alone? Obviously not.
这是整个手机行业面临的问题。
This is a problem for the entire mobile phone industry.
需求端和供应端的双双下探，使得整体手机市场收缩。
Demand and supply are both down, causing the overall mobile phone market to shrink.
近日，第三方数据机构Strategy Analytics调整预期称，2020第一季度，中国智能手机市场的出货量会有超50%的下滑，这家分析机构2月1日发布的报告中，这个数字是30%。
In the first quarter of 2020, shipments of smartphones in China are expected to decline by more than 50%, according to a revised forecast by Strategy Analytics, a third-party data organization.
中间只间隔短短不到二十天。
The interval was less than twenty days.
宗清楷维持了此前对《财经》记者的市场预测，第一季度手机零售量会有40%的下滑，二季度至少有20%下滑。
Mr Zong maintained previous market forecasts for Caijing, which saw retail sales fall by 40 per cent in the first quarter and by at least 20 per cent in the second quarter.
郭明錤则发布报告预测，2020年第一季度，iPhone出货量将会下降至3600万部至4000万部，减少10%。
Mr. Guo predicts shipments of the iPhone will fall by 10%, to 36 million to 40 million units in the first quarter of 2020.
除iPhone外，AirPods 和笔记本等产品的生产也受到不同程度的冲击。
Production of products such as AirPods and laptops, in addition to the iPhone, has been hit to varying degrees.
苹果（中国）官网显示，AirPods的预计发货日期还是一个工作日，2019年秋推出的新品AirPods Pro，预计发货日期已延长至4周。
Apple Inc. 's expected delivery date is one business day, and AirPods Pro, a new product introduced in the autumn of 2019, is expected to be extended to four weeks, according to Apple's official website.
主要生产AirPods 的歌尔股份，自2月10日起开始分批复工、错峰上班，何时全面复工仍是未知数。
Goyle, which produces mainly AirPods, resumed work in batches and at staggered peaks from February 10, and it remains to be seen when full work will resume.
富士康成都生产笔记本、iPad和Apple Watch。
Foxconn makes notebooks, iPads and Apple Watch.
园区通知2月10日全面复工，但到位的员工不足两万，一位富士康成都的员工向《财经》记者说，产能肯定跟不上。
The park told Caijing on February 10 that it would be fully operational, but with fewer than 20,000 employees on board, a Foxconn employee told Caijing that capacity was bound to fall behind.
线上、应用商店是止痛剂吗？硬件线下销售渠道休克，一个缓冲带是线上销售渠道。
Is an online, app store a painkiller? Hardware-line sales channel shock, a buffer is an online sales channel.
据第三方市场调研机构Counterpoint数据显示，2019年第三季度，中国智能手机线上销售比例为27%，较当年第一季度上升3个百分点。
In the third quarter of 2019, Chinese smartphone online sales were 27%, up three percentage points from the first quarter of the year, according to third-party market researcher Counterpoint.
苹果在线上智能手机市场占9%市场份额。
Apple has 9% of the smartphone market online.
紧接着的第四季度，iPhone 11 系列发布后，苹果依靠线上折扣促销产品、清理旧版iPhone 库存。
Then, in the fourth quarter, after the iPhone 11 release, Apple relied on online discounts to promote sales of its older iPhone stock.
一批网友在惯性吐槽新产品过后大呼“真香”。
A group of netizens in inertial groove after the new product shouted "really fragrant."
国际数据公司IDC数据显示，2019年第四季度，苹果手机在中国的出货量为1240万台，同比增长4.8%，市场份额也同比增长2.8%。
In the fourth quarter of 2019, Apple's handsets shipped 12.4 million units in China, up 4.8% from a year earlier and 2.8% year-on-year, according to IDC.
过去的2017、2018、2019财年，iPhone手机占苹果公司营收比例分别为60.78%、62.08%、54.73%。
The iPhone accounted for 60.78%, 62.08% and 54.73% of Apple's revenue for the past fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.
受益于iPhone降价与加重线上渠道等因素，苹果公司2020年第一财季，净营收、净利润分别实现同比9%、11%的增长。
In the first quarter of 2020, Apple posted 9% year-on-year growth in net revenue and 11% year-on-year, helped by lower iPhone prices and increased online access.
但是，手机业务营收占比上扬，依然过半（60.94%）。
However, the mobile phone business income ratio rose, still more than half (60.94%).
其中，大中华区营收为135.78亿美元，比去年同期增长4.19亿美元。
Greater China accounted for $13.578 billion, an increase of $419 million over the same period last year.
疫情影响下的第二财季，打击将会是明显的。
In the second quarter of the epidemic, the blow will be obvious.
目前仍然很难用数据评估，疫情期间苹果线上销售是否一定程度上抵消了线下销售下滑的冲击。
It is still difficult to use data to assess whether Apple's online sales more or less offset the downturn in offline sales during the epidemic.
多位分析师均向《财经》记者分析，疫情对经济的负向影响最终会传导到消费者的腰包，公众对手机等非必需品的消费意愿，将会普遍降低或后延。
Analysts have told Caijing that the negative impact of the epidemic on the economy will eventually spread to consumers, and that public willingness to spend on non-essential items such as mobile phones will generally decline or be delayed.
此外，线下渠道仍是苹果的重要销售渠道，线上销售无法完全对冲线下销售减少带来的损失。
In addition, offline channels continue to be an important source of sales for Apple, and online sales cannot fully hedge against losses from offline sales.
另一个缓冲带应用商店的作用就明显多了。
The other buffer-application store is much more effective.
与线下受阻的硬件生产相反，第三方数据分析机构Sensor Tower数据显示，1月份苹果应用商店的收入同比增长23%，环比增长6%，在中国表现强劲。
In contrast to offline hardware production, Apple's App Store posted a 23% year-on-year increase in revenue in January, compared with 6% growth in the Ring, and a strong performance in China, according to Sensor Tower, a third-party data analyst.
这是疫情给人们带来的最长假期、最宅春节的结果。
This is the epidemic of people to bring the longest holiday, the most residential Spring Festival results.
QuestMoblie《中国互联网“战役”专题报告》显示，从1月23日期，全网用户每日使用总时长，从原来的50亿，一路飙升至57.6亿小时（1月24日，火神山直播）、61.1亿小时（2月3日，在家办公首日）。
According to QuestMoblie's "Campaign of the Internet in China" special report, from January 23, the total number of hours a day used by Internet users surged from 5 billion to 5.76 billion hours (broadcast live from Mount Fire on January 24) and 6.11 billion hours (first day of work from home on February 3).
苹果应用商店粘性本身较高，“宅经济”给应用商店带来的潜在付费率和使用频率的提升，大概率将会挽回部分iPhone销量的损失。
Apple's App Store is inherently sticky, and the "home economy" is likely to recoup some of the iPhone's sales by increasing the potential rate and frequency of usage it brings to apps.
但是，2019财年，苹果公司的服务业务营收占总营收17.79%，2020第一财季服务业务营收占比下滑至13.85%。
However, Apple's service revenue is 17.79% in the 2019 fiscal year and 13.85% in the 2020 first quarter.
对于大部分收入仍依赖硬件的苹果，应用商店的增收，不足以完全抵消iPhone等产线受阻带来压力。
For Apple, which still relies on hardware for most of its revenue, revenue from app stores isn't enough to fully offset the pressure of blockages on production lines such as the iPhone.
可穿戴设备能够分散一定的iPhone供需减少的风险。
Wearable devices can spread the risk of reduced demand for and supply of certain iPhones.
2019年第四财季，库克称AirPods、Apple Watch和Beats取得了“爆炸性增长”。
In the fourth quarter of 2019, Cook called AirPods, Apple Watch, and Beats "explosive growth."
过去的2020年第一财季，苹果的AirPods、Apple Watch等可穿戴设备业务增长44%。
Apple's Wearable Equipment businesses, such as AirPods and Apple Watch, grew 44% in the past fiscal quarter of 2020.
其中，Apple Watch 75%用户为新用户。
Of these, 75% of Apple Watch users are new users.
但是，正如上所述，营收占比超80%的硬件设备遭遇不同程度冲击，复工率也将影响这些产品的出货量。
However, as mentioned above, hardware equipment that accounts for over 80 per cent of revenue is subject to varying degrees of impact, and the rate of return to work will also affect shipments of these products.
综合看来，苹果公司仍需要清库存、保后续出货量两不误。
Taken together, Apple still needs to clear its inventory and keep its shipments afloat.
疫情的连锁反应不止于此。
The ripple effect of the epidemic does not stop there.
尽管世界卫生组织（WHO）没有将中国列为疫区，而是“国际关注的突发公共卫生事件（PHEIC）”，许多国家近期还是选择对到中国的旅游的人员作出警示，这会影响苹果公司的员工到中国的出差计划，进而影响新产品的开发进度。
Although the World Health Organization (WHO) does not list China as an affected area, but rather as a "public health emergency of international concern" (PHEIC), many countries have recently chosen to warn travellers to China that this could affect the travel plans of Apple employees to China and thus the development of new products.
2020年是5G手机上量之年、爆发之年。
The year 2020 is the year of 5G cell phones and the year of the outbreak.
但是受疫情影响，苹果2020年的新产品验证和量产时间可能延后。
But Apple's new product validation and mass production schedule for 2020 could be delayed by the epidemic.
如果疫情影响持续，为缩短验证程序，苹果公司将不得不推迟新材料导入或降低零组件测试要求。
If the epidemic continues, Apple will have to postpone new material imports or lower zero component testing requirements to shorten the validation process.
对国内的供应链企业来说，疫情触发的影响很可能是深层次的。
For domestic supply-chain companies, the epidemic's triggering effects are likely to be deep.
苹果可能会加速供应链的分散化进程。
Apple could accelerate the process of decentralizing the supply chain.
一位代工企业的高管对《财经》记者预测，劳动力的影响只是开端。
One executive at a contract company told Caijing that the labour impact was just the beginning.
疫情影响具有不确定性，最好的预期是3月初能够恢复80%产能，最悲观的预期是持续到5月。
The impact of the outbreak is uncertain, with the best expectation of 80 per cent capacity being restored in early March and the most pessimistic forecast continuing into May.
那么，富士康、和硕等代工厂的海外产能布局将加快加重，“苹果在中国的断链效应才开始”。
Then, Foxconn, Asus and other factories will accelerate the distribution of overseas capacity, "Apple in China before the chain-breaking effect."
在苹果公司公布的全球200大供应商（2019年版）中，来自中国台湾、中国大陆和中国香港的公司一共86家。
Of Apple's 200 global suppliers (2019), 86 are from Taiwan, China and Hong Kong, China.
占到苹果供应商数量的43%。
It accounts for 43% of Apple's suppliers.
去年，鸿海在印度开始生产新品iPhone,但是对本次疫情的整体补足和缓冲能力有限。
Hon Hai began making its new iPhone in India last year, but has limited overall supply and cushioning capacity.
应对劳动力缺口，苹果公司的第一方案，是敦促国内代工企业加快复工复产。
Apple's first solution to the labor gap is to urge domestic contractors to speed up the resumption of work.
15-20天的交货延迟尚可承受，如果超过30天，苹果很可能启动备选方案，最大化利用印度等地的海外产能。
A 15-to-20-day delivery delay is tolerable, and Apple is likely to launch options to maximize overseas capacity, such as in India, if more than 30 days.
“原本在大陆生产的苹果旧机型最先转移，如果疫情影响持续，新机型后续也可能考虑海外工厂”。
"Old Apple models made in the mainland are the first to move, and if the epidemic continues, new models may also be considered for overseas plants," he said.
上述代工企业高管补充道。
Executives at the above-mentioned companies added.
苹果已经意识到供应链过度集中于中国的风险，早在5年前就催促产业链向东南亚、印度转移，只是囿于当地产业工人不成熟、配套设施不完善等因素，一再推迟。
Apple, aware of the risks of an overconcentration of supply chains in China, has been pushing the chain to Southeast Asia and India for five years, only to be delayed by factors such as immature local industrial workers and inadequate supporting facilities.
另外，中美贸易战并未熄火，“重振美国制造业”仍然是特朗普的政治资本。
Moreover, the Sino-US trade war has not stalled, and "reviving American manufacturing" remains Trump's political capital.
两相叠加，供应链的微妙变化将会更快地显化。
With two phases superimposed, the subtle changes in the supply chain will manifest more quickly.
不过，Strategy Analytics 分析师吴怡雯向《财经》记者分析，苹果在国内的市场份额可能会减少，但中国总体的制造能力短期无可取代。
However, analyst Ng Yiwen of Strategy Analytics told Caijing that Apple's domestic market share may be declining, but China's overall manufacturing capacity is irreplaceable in the short term.
影响更多是短期的，苹果产业链的成熟度，也会起到一定的缓冲作用。
Impact is more short-term, the maturity of the Apple industrial chain, will also play a certain buffer.
