编辑成卿1月24日 火神山医院施工开始 来源：人民日报1月25日、1月26日两天，武汉火神山医院、雷神山医院，两座用来收治新型冠状病毒肺炎患者而新建的专门医院先后开工。
010-62798811 2007-9-25 21: 55 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily January 25, January 26, Wuhan Hotsun Mountain Hospital, Lei Shenshan Hospital, two new hospitals set up to treat patients with the new coronavirus pneumonia began work.
同时，央视新闻对两座医院的施工现场进行24小时网络实时直播。
At the same time, CCTV News on the construction sites of the two hospitals 24-hour live network broadcast.
2月4日下午雷神山医院施工直播间超过9000万人次观看9000万+网友涌进直播间，给工地进行“云监工”，还给各种设施起了令人“上头”的名字：混凝土搅拌机是“送灰宗（宋徽宗）”，高层吊车是“送高宗（宋高宗）”，压路机是“多尔衮”，样板房是“白居易”，小叉车被戏称为“叉酱”，连摄影机底下的桂花树都有个“吴三桂”的名字。
On the afternoon of February 4, more than 90 million people watched the 90 million-plus netizens pour into the direct broadcasting studio, carrying out "cloud supervision" for the construction site, and gave the "Dawson" name for the concrete mixer, "Dorgan Dagon" for the high-rise crane, "Bai Juyi" for the high-rise crane, and "Wu Sangui" for the small forklift.
直播间出现设施“助力榜”直播造医院一度冲上微博热搜榜。
Direct broadcast facilities "help list" live hospital once rushed to micro-blog search list.
建造视频还曾一度“火”到了国外，许多外国网友惊叹于“中国速度”。
Construction video also once "fire" to foreign countries, many foreign users marvel at "Chinese speed."
中国速度，比他们想象的更快。
China is moving faster than they think.
建造中的火神山医院 来源：人民日报火神山和雷神山医院的取名不是两座医院所在地的名字，而是被建设者们在这次疫情之下赋予特殊意义，湖北《长江日报》的报道中解释说：楚文化传说中的湖北是古楚之地，楚国人被认为是火神祝融的后代，人的肺部五行属金，火克金。
Hubei, the legendary land of the Chu culture, is the land of ancient Chu, the Chu people are thought to be the descendants of the god of fire, the five lungs of people are gold and fire-clad gold.
荼毒人类肺部的新型冠状病毒惧怕高温，火神正好能驱瘟神，“火神山”之名应运而生。
The new coronavirus that destroys the human lungs dreads the heat, and the god of fire can repel the evil spirit.
至于雷神山，也是对应着中国民俗文化的传说：雷神是惩罚罪恶之神。
As for Lei Shenshan, it is also the legend corresponding to Chinese folk culture: Thor is the god of punishment for evil.
凡有违背人伦法理且犯下不可饶恕罪责者，则将遭受五雷轰顶而毙亡。
Anyone who violates human decency and commits unpardonable crimes will be blown to death.
1月30日，北京小汤山医院启动修缮，为疫情变化做准备图片来源：新京报2003年，在北京市昌平区小汤山镇，也曾有这样一家医院在7天内拔地而起，应对当时肆虐的SARS疫情。
Beijing's Xiaotangshan Hospital launched a renovation on January 30 to prepare for the change in the epidemic. In 2003, the Beijing News reported that in Xiaotangshan Township, Changping District, Beijing, such a hospital was also set up in seven days to deal with the SARS epidemic then raging.
小汤山医院的设计者是中国机械工业集团中国中元国际工程公司医疗首席总建筑师黄锡璆，今年已经79岁。
The designer of Xiaotangshan Hospital is 79 years old, with Huang Xiang, chief medical architect at China's Zhongyuan International Engineering Company, the Chinese machinery industry group.
建筑师黄锡璆 来源：人民日报1月24日农历大年三十，当天上午，黄锡璆在工作人员搀扶下进到北京的公司会议室，和同事们一起回忆小汤山医院的建设过程，查看他们拿到的武汉火神山医院布局图，为火神山医院的建设提供咨询建议。
Architects with good intentions: People's Daily January 24 30, the Chinese New Year's Day, Huang Xiang staff helped staff into the company conference room in Beijing, and colleagues recall the construction process, to see the layout of Wuhan Huoshen Mountain Hospital, to provide advice on the construction of the hospital.
时隔17年，这个曾经的设计团队再次集结，当年的建设图纸也在第一时间被发到此次火神山医院的设计单位。
After a 17-year hiatus, the former design team regrouped, the year's construction drawings were first sent to the design unit of the Mount Fire Hospital.
“曾有很多地方来找我们要图纸，但没想到真的还能再用上。
"Lots of places came to see us for blueprints, but I didn't expect them to be used again.
” 黄锡璆在接受采访时感慨。
Huang Xiang lamented when he was interviewed.
2月2日火神山医院竣工 来源：人民日报2月2日，火神山医院完成施工交付，2月3日开始收治病人。
February 2, the completion of the Mount Huoshen Hospital: February 2, the People's Daily, the completion of the construction of Mount Huoshen Hospital delivery, February 3 began to accept patients.
不设门诊，主要救治确诊患者，开设了重症监护病区、重症病区和普通病区，配备有感染控制、检验、特诊、放射诊断等辅助科室。
There is no out-patient service, and patients are mainly treated and diagnosed. Intensive care, severe and common disease areas have been opened, equipped with auxiliary departments for infection control, testing, special consultation and radiologic diagnosis.
据报道，第一批转到火神山的50名患者来自汉口医院、武昌医院等三所医院，基本都是轻症患者。
According to reports, the first 50 patients transferred to Mount Huoshen came from Hankou Hospital, Wuchang Hospital and other three hospitals, all of which were light cases.
这一次转院是军地之间的交接，算是试水，两方在交接过程中进行磨合、熟悉流程，防止出现之前没有预估到的问题。
This transfer is a military-to-military transfer, a test of water, the two sides in the process of transition to wear, familiar with the process, to prevent the emergence of previously did not anticipate the problem.
先转轻症患者，之后会转确诊的重症患者。
Patients with mild to moderate conditions will be referred to a confirmed severe case.

火神山医院卫星图在之前武汉医院床位紧缺的情况下，火神山、雷神山两间医院的落成一共可以提供2500多个床位，其中火神山有1000余张床位，雷神山有1560张床位。
With a shortage of beds in Wuhan Hospital, the two hospitals, Fo Shen Shan and Lei Shenshan, can provide more than 2,500 beds, including more than 1,000 beds in Fosen Mountain and 1,560 beds in Raytheon Hill.
快速建造的医院安全吗？在美国建筑公司HOK负责医疗保健业务的建筑师Scott Rawlings说：中国人正在建造的不是典型的医疗机构，而是 “管理感染的隔离中心”，像火神山、雷神山医院以集装箱这样的预制件或“模块化结构”建造的医院，是非常安全的。
Scott Rawlings, the architect in charge of health care at the US construction company HOK, said: The Chinese are not building typical medical institutions, but "isolation centers for managing infections." Hospitals like Flamingo Hill and Raytheon Mountain Hospital, built with containers or "modular structures," are very safe.
火神山医院平面布局 来源：中信建筑设计研究总院作为传染病医院，医护人员的安全十分重要。
As a hospital for infectious diseases, the safety of medical staff is very important.
正如当年的非典小汤山医院的成功，不仅在于收治了全国七分之一的SARS患者，更重要的是实现了医护人员零感染。
Just as the success of the SARS Xiaotangshan Hospital in that year, not only treated one in seven SARS sufferers in the country, but also achieved zero infection among medical personnel.
而火神山、雷神山两座医院严格明确医患分区分流、洁污分区、分流。
But the fire god mountain, the thunder Shenshan two hospitals strictly clear doctor-patient division diversion, decontamination area, shunt.
此外，还设立了独立的医护生活区，保障一线医护人员的住宿休息和就餐问题。
In addition, independent health-care living areas have been set up to ensure that front-line health-care workers can rest and eat.
无接触超市火神山医院投入使用的第一天，一家特殊的疫区超市也正式营业：没有店员、没有收银员，买完东西扫码即走。
On the first day of operation of the No-Contact Supermarket, a supermarket in a particularly affected area opened: no clerks, no cashiers, no sweeping yards away.
里面准备了充足的消毒用品、卫生清洁用品、方便食品和日用杂货，为医务工作者供应便捷、安全的物资。
Sufficient disinfection supplies, sanitary cleaning materials, ready-to-use food and groceries have been prepared to provide convenient and safe supplies for medical workers.
医疗垃圾焚烧炉来源：网络而对于很多网友关心的污染问题，传染病医院有着严格的设计执行标准：建造选择远离人口密集、水源保护地等敏感地段；医院的废水，从排出到处理合格要经过严格的工序，要先在院区内经过全封闭的收集和预消毒处理，再提升到污水处理站进行生化处理，最终经系统检测合格后，才会排入市政管网；医疗废弃物，有专门容器的密封装载，经专人运送至城市的垃圾处理中心，通过高温焚烧法、高压蒸汽灭菌法、化学消毒法等进行处理。
Hospitals for infectious diseases have strict design enforcement standards for many netizens concerned with pollution problems: construction options are separated from sensitive areas such as densely populated water reserves. Hospital waste water, from discharge to treatment, goes through a rigorous process of collection and pre-disinfection before it is discharged into municipal networks.

2月1日，我们与忙碌在设计院和医院施工现场之中的他做了一次连线采访。
On February 1, we had a live interview with him at the design institute and the hospital's construction site.
以下为李洁的自述。
The following is Li Jie's self-report.
这中间的许多公历日期会记不清楚，我就用农历日子说吧。
Many of these Gregorian calendar days will not remember clearly, I will use the lunar calendar to say.
大年三十那天晚上9点多，我们接到了武汉城乡建设局的电话，要在2月5日建造完成雷神山医院，2月6日就要投入使用。
On the evening of New Year's Day, we received a telephone call from Wuhan Urban and Rural Construction Bureau to complete the construction of Lui Shenshan Hospital on February 5 and put it into use on February 6.
在这之前武汉的另一个设计院开始设计火神山医院，所以接到这个任务我们也不意外，之前就估摸着一个医院可能不够（抵挡这次的疫情）。
Wuhan before another design institute began to design the fire god mountain hospital, so we were not surprised to receive this task, before feeling that a hospital may not be enough.
军运村的运动员餐厅即将变成为医护人员服务的后勤保障楼来源：武汉中南建筑设计院我们设计院有个医疗健康事业部，专门做医疗建筑的设计，通常一个正规医院的设计要花上几个月的时间。
Wuhan Zhongnan Institute of Architecture and Design has a medical and health department specializing in the design of medical buildings. Usually it takes months to design a formal hospital.
接到雷神山这个项目，我们按照截止日期倒着推，两天时间里要完成所有的设计和施工图纸的交付。
On receiving the project from Mount Raytheon, we pushed backwards according to the deadline and had to complete the delivery of all the design and construction drawings in two days.
这边挂了城乡建设局的电话，那边就赶紧组织起20多人的队伍，晚上10点，这个团队就站在雷神山医院的待建场地上，勘察现场了。
This side hung the city and countryside construction bureau's telephone, that hurriedly organizes the 20 people's line, at 10 p.m., this team stands on the Raytheon Hill Hospital's pending construction site, inspects the scene.
在这之前大家还都在跟家人吃着年夜饭。
Before that, everyone was eating Chinese New Year's Eve dinner with their families.
雷神山医院施工现场来源：网络雷神山项目与火神山项目稍有不同，火神山医院是在一块荒地上开建的，雷神山医院是在武汉市江夏区黄家湖畔军运村的一块停车场上新建。
Lui Shenshan Hospital construction site: the network of Lei Shenshan project and the fire god mountain project slightly different, the fire god mountain hospital is built on a wasteland, Lei Shenshan Hospital is in Wuhan Jiangxia District Huangjiahu side of a parking lot.
停车场旁边有一座军运会的运动员餐厅，已经落成并可以直接使用，会改造为向医护人员提供住宿和就餐的后勤保障楼。
Next to the parking lot is an athletic dining hall of the military sports meet, which has been built and is ready for immediate use. It will be converted into a logistics building to accommodate and feed medical staff.
因为是传染病临时医院，大家担心会不会对周边的居民有影响。
Because it is a temporary hospital for infectious diseases, people are worried about the impact on the surrounding residents.
军运村附近建好的商品房还未交付，疫情过去之后医院会停止使用，完全不会影响，请大家不要担心。
The construction of commercial housing near the military transport village has not yet been delivered, the hospital will stop use after the epidemic, will not affect, please do not worry.
雷神山医院施工现场来源：武汉中南建筑设计院当晚现场勘察一结束，大家直接回到办公室里加班加点画图纸。
Lui Shenshan Hospital construction site source: Wuhan Zhongnan architectural design institute that night site survey ended, we went directly back to the office to work overtime drawing.
留在武汉过年的都被召集来了办公室，不在武汉的在网上远程做支持。
Those who stayed in Wuhan for the Spring Festival were called to the office instead of Wuhan, which did remote support on the Internet.
当时疫情已非常严重了，办公室里的所有人都带着口罩在工作。
The outbreak was so severe that everyone in the office was working with masks on.
武汉从腊月二十九开始封城，公交系统停运，住得远又不会开车的同事，家属也上阵，每天负责接送。
Wuhan from the 29th beginning of the closure of the city, the public transport system stopped, living far away and can not drive colleagues, family members are also involved in daily transport.
还有不少同事就备好了折叠躺椅，累得不行就在躺椅上睡一会儿，再起来干。
Many colleagues are ready to fold the lounge chair, tired to sleep in the lounge chair, then get up to work.
第一稿建筑方案，不到12小时，第二天年初一早上9点提交了。

向市长汇报，和卫健委、当年非典小汤山的设计团队开会，综合意见对方案再进行修改。
Report to the mayor, and health committee, the year of the design team of SARS Xiaotangshan meeting, comprehensive opinion on the program for further revision.
施工开始后，因为工地上所用的许多材料、设备都是热心企业捐助的，参数上总会有些不符合设计图纸的地方，我们根据施工情况再不断地修改、优化。
After the construction began, as many of the materials and equipment used on the construction site were donated by interested enterprises, there will always be areas where the parameters do not conform to the design drawings.
雷神山医院模型来源：武汉中南建筑设计院整个雷神山医院分为医疗隔离区和医护区。
Lei Shenshan Hospital model source: Wuhan Zhongnan architectural design institute the whole Lei Shenshan Hospital divided into medical isolation zone and medical care area.
医疗隔离区有17个足球场大小，划分为病房区、医技楼、ICU病房等，设置了1560个床位，其中1500个普通床位，60个ICU床位。
The Medical Separation Area, which is 17 football fields in size, is divided into ward areas, medical technology buildings, ICU wards, etc., and has 1,560 beds, 1,500 ordinary beds and 60 ICU beds.

“三区”是指清洁区、半污染区和污染区。
"Area three" means the clean area, semi-polluted area and polluted area.
医务人员有自己的清洁工作区和对应的连续通道，病房是污染区，在清洁区与病房之间是半污染区，医护人员的很多工作，比如进出病房增加或减少着装的防护等，都在半污染区里来完成。
Medical staff have their own clean working area and corresponding continuous access, the wards are polluted areas, and between the cleaning areas and wards are semi-polluted areas. Much of the work of medical staff, such as increasing access to wards or reducing clothing protection, is done in semi-polluted areas.
病人通道与医护人员的通道是各自独立的，这样减少医护人员被感染的可能性。
The patient's access is separate from that of the medical staff, which reduces the risk of infection for health-care workers.
雷神山医院病房模型来源：武汉中南建筑设计院病房都是负压隔离病房，各个病房都独立设置了分体空调，避免交叉污染。

排风也是采用高效过滤器过滤后才在高空进行排放。
The exhaust is also filtered by high-efficiency filters before being discharged at high altitudes.
医院的废水，经过预消毒处理、生化处理等步骤，系统检测合格后才会排入市政管网。
Hospital wastewater, after pre-disinfection treatment, biochemical treatment and other steps, the system will pass the test before being discharged into the municipal network.
不会污染附近湖泊，也请大家放心。

雷神山医院施工中 来源：中国经济网相比于17年前建造的小汤山医院，现在的建设标准又提高了很多，细节考虑更多。
China's economic network is much more standard-setting and more detailed than the Xiaotangshan Hospital, which was built 17 years ago.
比如救护车送患者的通道入口要做上遮雨棚，不能让患者露天，入口的台阶要做好无障碍的通道等等。
For example, ambulance transport to the entrance to the passage to do a shelter, not open to patients, entrance steps to do a barrier-free access, and so on.
除了生理上的治疗，也要照顾到病人和高压力环境下医护人员的心理需求，沿着院区的围墙会种植乔木、灌木。
In addition to physical treatment, but also to take into account the psychological needs of patients and high-stress medical staff, along the courtyard walls will be planted trees, shrubs.
雷神山医院施工中 来源：中国经济网其实，除了雷神山、火神山这两座倍受大家关注的医院之外，我们的设计师们还在配合湖北各处的医院进行改造。
In fact, in addition to the two high-profile hospitals, Lui Shenshan and Huoshen Mountain, our designers are also working with hospitals around Hubei to carry out renovation.
突发这样的疫情，许多医院的传染病科室、床位数不够用，需要把其他科室改建成传染病科室。
The outbreak of such an epidemic, many hospitals infectious disease departments, beds are not enough, the need to transform other departments into infectious disease departments.
现在我们手上这样的医院改造有十多个，完成后，小型的能增加两三百张病床，大型一些的能增加上五六百张病床。
Now we have more than a dozen such hospital renovation, when completed, the small can increase the number of beds by two or three hundred, the larger can add up to five to six hundred beds.
我知道网络上对火神山和雷神山医院施工的直播很受大家的关注，我自己每天也都会去看一下，说实话真的很自豪、很有成就感。
I know that the live broadcast of the construction of the Fire Goddess Mountain and Lei Shenshan Hospital on the Internet is very popular, and I go to see it myself every day.
1月24日“中元国际”的医疗建筑团队与武汉火神山医院设计团队连线来源：人民日报有着非典小汤山医院设计建造经验的中国中元国际工程有限公司（以下简称“中元国际”），为这次火神山、雷神山医院提供了许多设计、建造意见，并针对这次新型肺炎疫情，编制了《传染病收治应急医疗设施改造及新建技术导则》，在2月3日下午公开。
On January 24, the medical construction team of Zhongyuan International was connected to the design team of Wuhan Huoshen Mountain Hospital. People's Daily, with experience in designing and constructing the Sars Xiaotangshan Hospital, provided a lot of design and construction suggestions for the Mount Fujimori and Lei Shenshan Hospital.
以下是针对临时传染病医院建设，一条对中元国际的医疗建筑设计专家的采访。
The following is an interview with a specialist in medical architecture of Zhongyuan International for the construction of a temporary infectious disease hospital.
火神山医院鸟瞰，来源：中信建筑设计研究总院Q: 选择建造传染病医院，什么样的地最合适?A：在选址上，新建建筑的选址宜位于地质条件良好、市政配套设施齐备、交通便利等位置，并远离人口密集、水源保护地等敏感地段，且与院外周边建筑设置大于或等于20m的绿化隔离卫生间距。
Aerial view of Fo Shen Shan Hospital, Source: CUHK Q: What is the most suitable site for the construction of an infectious disease hospital? A: In siting, new buildings should be located in good geological conditions, complete with municipal supporting facilities, convenient transportation, and away from sensitive areas such as densely populated and protected water resources.
如果在已建成的综合医院中改造应急收治区，应将它设置在相对独立的区域。
If an emergency ward is renovated in an established general hospital, it should be located in a relatively separate area.
此外，还要考虑配建医护人员的就近临时居住、倒班值班宿舍等设施。
In addition, we should also consider the nearby temporary housing of medical staff, shift duty dormitory and other facilities.
2月3日晚上，武汉市开始建设三家“方舱医院”，收治新型冠状病毒感染的轻症患者来源：央视新闻Q：为什么临时传染病医院不能直接征用并改造酒店或体育场馆？A：酒店大多都是一条走廊两边布置房间，传染病医院需要医护人员和病患的分流，要布置双侧走廊，改造需要大量建筑格局上的拆改。
On the night of Feb. 3, Wuhan began construction of three "square-cabin hospitals" to treat patients suffering from mild coronavirus infections.
此外，酒店的暖风系统，过滤级别、独立通风设计、压力梯度等，都不能满足传染病医院的设计规范要求，尤其是呼吸道传染病。
In addition, the hotel's heating system, filtration level, independent ventilation design, pressure gradient, etc. can not meet the design specifications of infectious disease hospitals, especially respiratory infectious diseases.
而室内体育场馆，内部通风效果不好，不适合用于应急传染病医院。
And indoor sports stadiums, internal ventilation effect is not good, not suitable for emergency infectious disease hospitals.
Q：在临时应急传染病医院中，哪些设计有助于降低传染率和感染率？A：在运送患者的环节上，采用负压救护车运送患者，并在院区出入口设置通过式急救车洗消站；转运患者的推床，宜配置防止患者口鼻飞沫飞溅的防护罩等。
Q ： Which design can help reduce the infection rate and infection rate in the temporary emergency infectious disease hospitalA: In transporting patients, a negative pressure ambulance is used to transport the patient and a pass-through ambulance is set at the entrance and exit of the hospital area.
在建筑流程上，建筑设施与组织气流有效结合，限制区、隔离区里要严格控制空气的流动方向，按不同压力梯度只可从半清洁区、向半污染区、再向污染区单向流动；在流线上，严格划分医务人员与患者的交通流线，清洁物流和污染物流分设专用路线，各种流线避免交叉。
In the construction process, the construction facilities and tissue air flow should be combined effectively. The flow direction of air should be strictly controlled in the restricted area and isolation area. According to different pressure gradients, one-way flow can only be obtained from semi-clean area, semi-polluted area and polluted area.
在病房设计中，疑似病人宜采用单人负压病房；确诊病人可采用两人负压病房。
In the ward design, the patient should adopt the single person negative pressure ward; The confirmed patient may use the two-person negative pressure ward.
危重症患者或其他需要单独救治的患者，应采用单人负压隔离病房。
Critical patients or other patients who need to be treated separately, should use a single negative pressure isolation room.
此外，病房、缓冲间、卫生间、洗消间、走廊及其他需要灭菌消毒的场所设置紫外线消毒灯，用以消毒灭菌。
In addition, ultraviolet disinfectant lamps are installed in wards, buffers, bathrooms, washrooms, corridors and other areas requiring sterilization for sterilization.
火神山医院施工场地上，集装箱材料在拼装来源：网络Q: 在建造上，北京小汤山医院与武汉火神山、雷神山医院有什么区别？A：在建筑主体材料方面，基于当时条件，小汤山医院二部病房采用整体式钢筋混凝土盒子式活动房，复合了好几种轻便建筑材料，有效拼接是当时的难题。
What is the difference between the construction of Xiaotangshan Hospital in Beijing and that of Wuhan Huoshen Mountain and Lei Shenshan Hospital in BeijingA: In terms of the main building materials, the second ward of Xiaotangshan Hospital was built on the basis of the prevailing conditions and combined with several portable building materials.
而这次武汉火神山、雷神山医院都采用了集装箱材料在现场进行拼装。
This time Wuhan fire god mountain, Lei Shenshan hospital have used container materials in the field of assembly.
集装箱的尺寸统一，便于快速拼装。
The size of the container is uniform and easy to assemble quickly.
Q：疫情结束后，对临时传染病医院会进行怎样的处理？A：疫情结束后，临时新建的传染病医院会根据临时建筑的使用要求以及疫情后续观察程序保留一段时间。
Q ： What will happen to the temporary infectious disease hospital after the outbreak finishA: After the outbreak is over, the temporary new infectious disease hospital will be maintained for a certain period of time according to the requirements for the use of temporary buildings and the follow-up observation procedure for the outbreak.
疫情彻底结束并经过各方专家论证后可以拆除，场地经彻底灭菌消毒后可用作其他建设；临时改造的传染病医院经彻底灭菌消毒，并经过一定时间停用观察、检测无害后，也可进行改造用作其他用途。
The epidemic situation can be completely eliminated and verified by experts from all sides, and the site can be completely sterilized and disinfected before being used for other construction.After being thoroughly sterilized and disinfected, and after a certain period of time, the hospitals of infectious diseases can be transformed and used for other purposes.
