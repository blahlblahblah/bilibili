澎湃新闻记者 南博一3月10日，意大利的“1号病人”被转出重症监护病房（ICU），这给了连续作战的意大利医生们一点小小的安慰。
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Italian "patient number one" was removed from the intensive care unit (ICU) on March 10, providing little consolation to Italian doctors in continuous combat.
“1号病人”转出ICU伦巴第卫生部门确认的“1号病人”名叫马蒂亚，38岁，定居在科多尼奥，是联合利华的一名工人。
Patient 1 was transferred out of the ICU Lombardy health department and identified as "patient No. 1," a 38-year-old resident of Cordonio, a Unilever worker.
确诊后，马蒂亚在离米兰不远的帕维亚的圣马特奥医院接受治疗，该院重症监护室主任弗朗西斯科·莫约利10日告诉美联社，9日，在只有少量氧气的辅助下，马蒂亚开始自己呼吸，这让大家松了一口气。
After the diagnosis, Matia was treated at San Mateo Hospital in Pavia, not far from Milan. Francisco Moryooli, director of the intensive care unit, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that Martia had begun breathing on her own with only a little oxygen.
随后，马蒂亚从重症监护室被转移到一个亚重症监护室，并可以与医生交谈。
Matia was then transferred from the intensive care unit to a subintensive care unit, where he was able to talk to a doctor.
据意大利新闻网站“nextquotidiano”2月22日报道，在出现症状之前，马蒂亚在意大利北部多个城镇参加马拉松等比赛，和朋友多次聚餐。
Before the onset of symptoms, Matthias ran marathons and dinners with friends in several northern Italian towns, according to the Italian news website Nextquotidiano.
医院方面相信该病例至少传染了他怀有身孕的妻子、一名与他一起参加长跑活动的朋友以及三名年龄较大的当地人，这三位病例常常去马蒂亚朋友父亲开的酒吧中聚会。
Hospitals believe the case has infected at least his pregnant wife, a friend who ran with him on a long run, and three older locals, who often meet in bars run by friends and fathers in Matia.
不仅如此，他还很可能传染了科多尼奥当地医院的几名医护人员和病人，其中一名77岁的女患者已经因新冠肺炎去世。
What's more, he probably infected several doctors, nurses and patients at the local hospital in Cordonio, including a 77-year-old woman who died of pneumonia.
马蒂亚因此被多家意大利媒体称为“超级传播者”。
Matia has thus been dubbed a "super communicator" by several Italian media outlets.
在其确诊后，意大利政府23日封锁了伦巴第和威尼托两个大区的11个城镇。
After his diagnosis, the Italian Government on 23 December blocked 11 towns in the Lombardy and Veneto regions.
资源紧缺，ICU并非“先到先得”然而，马蒂亚的例子也侧面暴露出意大利目前医疗资源紧缺的事实。
Resources are scarce, and the ICU is not a "first come, first served" initiative.
据美联社10日报道，在意大利受疫情影响最严重的北部地区，新冠病毒感染人数呈指数级增加，医生们参照战时分诊的原则来决定谁能获得有限的ICU床位。
The number of people infected with the new crown virus has increased exponentially in Italy's worst-affected northern region, where doctors decide who has access to a limited number of ICU beds, based on the principle of war time diagnosis, AP reported Wednesday.
Play澎湃新闻编辑 黄璐 视频来源 itv news abc news责任编辑：杨一“这是我们的同事提出的一个看法，”意大利北部皮埃蒙特医生协会会长吉多·朱斯蒂托博士10日表示，“他们通常不会在正常情况下这么做，只是因为床位太少，有些人可能无法获得医疗资源，事情才逐渐变得戏剧化。
"It's an idea that our colleagues have come up with," Dr. Guido Giustito, president of the Piedmont Association of Doctors in Northern Italy, said Monday. "It's only because beds are so few that some people may not have access to medical resources that things are becoming more dramatic.
”据欧联网援引欧联通讯社报道，意大利紧急民防部、新冠肺炎疫情新闻中心表示，截至3月10日零时，意大利单日新增新冠肺炎病例1796例，累计确诊病例增至9220例；新增死亡病例97例，累计死亡463人，死亡率超过5%。
As of 00pm March 10, 1,796 new cases of pneumonia had been reported in Italy, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 9,220, with 97 new deaths and 463 cumulative deaths, or more than 5 percent, the EURONET reported.
意大利全国已有99座城市出现疫情。
In Italy, 99 cities have been affected.
报道称，在这场疫情危机下，由于ICU短缺，意大利麻醉学和重症监护学会发布了15条建议，作为决定转入重症监护病房的参考：包括病人的年龄和活下来的可能性，而不仅仅是“先到先得”。
During the crisis, the Italian Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care issued 15 recommendations for referral to ICU, including age and likelihood of survival, rather than just a "first come, first served" approach.
疫情最严重的伦巴第地大区政府一直在努力增加重症监护病房的容量：他们将手术室和康复室改造成隔离病房，提供给目前急需治疗的440名重症患者。
The regional government in Lombardy, the worst affected region, has been working to increase the capacity of intensive care units: they have converted operating rooms and rehabilitation rooms into isolation wards for 440 patients in acute need of treatment.
在过去的两周内就临时增加了150多个床位，预计在未来的一周内还会再增加150个。
More than 150 beds have been added temporarily in the past two weeks, and another 150 are expected to be added in the coming week.
但这还是远远不够。
But that is far from enough.
“不幸的是，我们才刚刚开始（处于疫情爆发初期），”米兰萨科医院传染病科主任马西莫·加利博士在接受意大利SkyTg24电视台采访时指出，伦巴第上周确诊的新冠肺炎感染人数与中国武汉在1月底报告的感染人数差不多。
"Unfortunately, we are just beginning [in the early stages of the outbreak]," Dr. Massimo Gali, director of infectious diseases at Mirasaco Hospital, told Italian television station SkyTg24 that the number of new cases of pneumonia diagnosed last week in Lombardy was similar to those reported in Wuhan, China, at the end of January.
他警告称，这些数字说明“疫情很可能会进一步扩散”。
These figures, he warned, "are likely to spread further."
退休医护人员重返“战场”据美国《华盛顿邮报》3月3日报道，为了缓解医疗资源紧张，意大利政府日前决定，紧急征调20万医护人员，包括让医护院校的护士专业学生们提前毕业，并召回了一些已经退休的医护人员前往疫情重灾区。
The Italian government has decided to urgently call in 200,000 health-care workers, including nursing students from health-care institutions, to ease the strain on health-care resources.
北部一些重点地区的医院则推迟了一些其他非重症病人的手术，并准备增设50%的床位。
Hospitals in some priority areas in the north have postponed operations on other non-critical patients and are preparing to add 50 per cent of beds.
美联社称，上周末，一位名叫 Doris Bia 的护士在脸书（Facebook）上发帖称，在辞职做了几年全职妈妈之后，近日她回到受灾严重的克雷莫纳的 Oglio Po 医院工作。
A nurse named Doris Bia posted on Facebook last weekend that she had recently returned to work at the Oglio Po hospital in Cramona after several years as a stay-at-home mom, AP reported.
她写道: “从明天开始，我将与那些不知疲倦地抗击新冠病毒的人们并肩作战。
"Starting tomorrow, I will fight with those who are working tirelessly against the new crown virus," she wrote.
”。
"
“我这么做是因为我不能无视他们的牺牲。
"I did it because I couldn't ignore their sacrifice.
”意大利总理孔特9日晚发表电视讲话说，为避免疫情进一步扩散，自10日起在全国范围内实施封城。
In a televised speech Tuesday night, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Conte said the city had been banned nationwide from 10 days to prevent further spread of the disease.
